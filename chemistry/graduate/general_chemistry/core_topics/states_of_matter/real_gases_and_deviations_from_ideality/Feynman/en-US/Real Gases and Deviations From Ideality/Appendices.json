            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. All definitions and constants necessary for the derivation and calculation are provided. The question is a standard exercise in physical chemistry concerning the relationship between an equation of state and the virial expansion. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the Boyle temperature, $T_B$, using the van der Waals equation of state, and then to calculate its numerical value for a specified gas. The derivation requires relating the van der Waals model to the virial expansion of the compressibility factor, $Z$.\n\nThe van der Waals equation of state is given as:\n$$ \\left(P+\\frac{a n^{2}}{V^{2}}\\right)\\left(V-n b\\right)=n R T $$\nIt is convenient to work with the molar volume, $\\bar{V} \\equiv \\frac{V}{n}$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$ \\left(P+\\frac{a}{\\bar{V}^{2}}\\right)\\left(\\bar{V}-b\\right)=R T $$\nThe compressibility factor, $Z$, is defined as $Z \\equiv \\frac{P V}{n R T}$, which in molar terms is $Z = \\frac{P\\bar{V}}{RT}$. Our goal is to find an expansion of $Z$ in powers of pressure, $P$, in the low-pressure limit.\n\nFirst, we solve the molar van der Waals equation for pressure, $P$:\n$$ P = \\frac{R T}{\\bar{V}-b} - \\frac{a}{\\bar{V}^{2}} $$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $P$ into the definition of $Z$:\n$$ Z = \\frac{\\bar{V}}{RT} \\left( \\frac{R T}{\\bar{V}-b} - \\frac{a}{\\bar{V}^{2}} \\right) = \\frac{\\bar{V}}{\\bar{V}-b} - \\frac{a}{RT\\bar{V}} $$\nThis expression gives $Z$ as a function of molar volume, $\\bar{V}$. The low-pressure limit ($P \\to 0$) corresponds to the high molar volume limit ($\\bar{V} \\to \\infty$). In this limit, the term $\\frac{b}{\\bar{V}}$ is small. We can therefore perform a Taylor expansion of the term $\\frac{\\bar{V}}{\\bar{V}-b}$ in powers of $\\frac{1}{\\bar{V}}$.\n$$ \\frac{\\bar{V}}{\\bar{V}-b} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{b}{\\bar{V}}} $$\nUsing the geometric series expansion $(1-x)^{-1} = 1 + x + x^2 + \\dots$, which is valid for $|x| < 1$, we set $x = \\frac{b}{\\bar{V}}$. For large $\\bar{V}$, we need only the leading terms:\n$$ \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{b}{\\bar{V}}} = 1 + \\frac{b}{\\bar{V}} + O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\bar{V}^2}\\right) $$\nwhere $O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\bar{V}^2}\\right)$ represents terms of second order and higher in $\\frac{1}{\\bar{V}}$.\nSubstituting this expansion back into the expression for $Z$:\n$$ Z = \\left(1 + \\frac{b}{\\bar{V}} + \\dots\\right) - \\frac{a}{RT\\bar{V}} = 1 + \\left(b - \\frac{a}{RT}\\right)\\frac{1}{\\bar{V}} + \\dots $$\nThis is the virial expansion of $Z$ in terms of molar density, $\\rho = \\frac{1}{\\bar{V}}$. The problem, however, requires an expansion in powers of pressure, $P$. To convert from an expansion in $\\frac{1}{\\bar{V}}$ to an expansion in $P$, we must relate $\\frac{1}{\\bar{V}}$ to $P$ in the low-pressure limit.\nIn the limit of low pressure, a real gas approaches ideal gas behavior, for which $P\\bar{V} = RT$. Therefore, to a first approximation, $\\frac{1}{\\bar{V}} \\approx \\frac{P}{RT}$. Substituting this approximation into the first-order correction term is sufficient to find the leading term in the pressure expansion:\n$$ Z \\approx 1 + \\left(b - \\frac{a}{RT}\\right)\\left(\\frac{P}{RT}\\right) $$\nRewriting this to match the form given in the problem statement:\n$$ Z = 1 + \\frac{1}{RT}\\left(b - \\frac{a}{RT}\\right)P + \\dots $$\nThe problem defines the second virial coefficient, $B(T)$, through the expansion:\n$$ Z = 1 + \\frac{B(T)}{RT} P + \\dots $$\nBy comparing the coefficients of the term linear in $P$ in our derived expansion and the given form, we can identify the second virial coefficient as predicted by the van der Waals model:\n$$ \\frac{B(T)}{RT} = \\frac{1}{RT}\\left(b - \\frac{a}{RT}\\right) \\implies B(T) = b - \\frac{a}{RT} $$\nThe Boyle temperature, $T_B$, is defined as the temperature at which the leading deviation from ideality vanishes at low pressure. This corresponds to the condition where the second virial coefficient is zero, i.e., $B(T_B) = 0$.\nSetting our expression for $B(T)$ to zero at $T = T_B$:\n$$ B(T_B) = b - \\frac{a}{RT_B} = 0 $$\nSolving for $T_B$:\n$$ b = \\frac{a}{RT_B} \\implies T_B = \\frac{a}{Rb} $$\nThis is the analytical expression for the Boyle temperature according to the van der Waals model.\n\nFinally, we must evaluate $T_B$ numerically using the provided parameters for a nitrogen-like gas:\n$a = 1.352\\,\\mathrm{L^{2}\\,bar\\,mol^{-2}}$\n$b = 0.0387\\,\\mathrm{L\\,mol^{-1}}$\n$R = 0.08314\\,\\mathrm{L\\,bar\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $T_B$:\n$$ T_B = \\frac{1.352\\,\\mathrm{L^{2}\\,bar\\,mol^{-2}}}{(0.08314\\,\\mathrm{L\\,bar\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (0.0387\\,\\mathrm{L\\,mol^{-1}})} $$\n$$ T_B = \\frac{1.352}{0.003217518}\\,\\mathrm{K} \\approx 420.214\\,\\mathrm{K} $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as required:\n$$ T_B \\approx 420.2\\,\\mathrm{K} $$\nThis concludes the derivation and calculation.",

It presents a standard, formalizable task from the discipline of physical chemistry, requiring the derivation of a fundamental constant from a theoretical model and its comparison with experimental data. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. First, the derivation of the critical compressibility factor, $Z_c$, from the van der Waals equation of state. Second, the calculation of the root-mean-square deviation of experimental values from this theoretical prediction.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Critical Compressibility Factor $Z_c$**\n\nThe molar van der Waals equation of state is given by\n$$ \\left(P + \\frac{a}{V^2}\\right)(V - b) = RT $$\nwhere $P$ is the pressure, $V$ is the molar volume, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $R$ is the universal gas constant. The parameters $a$ and $b$ account for intermolecular attractions and finite molecular volume, respectively.\n\nTo find the critical point, we must analyze the isotherms on a $P-V$ diagram. The critical isotherm has a point of horizontal inflection, which is defined by two mathematical conditions at the critical temperature $T_c$ and critical molar volume $V_c$:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial V} \\right)_{T=T_c} = 0 $$\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 P}{\\partial V^2} \\right)_{T=T_c} = 0 $$\nFirst, we express pressure $P$ as a function of $V$ and $T$ from the van der Waals equation:\n$$ P(V, T) = \\frac{RT}{V-b} - \\frac{a}{V^2} $$\nNow, we compute the required derivatives. The first derivative with respect to volume at constant temperature is:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial V} \\right)_T = -\\frac{RT}{(V-b)^2} + \\frac{2a}{V^3} $$\nThe second derivative is:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 P}{\\partial V^2} \\right)_T = \\frac{2RT}{(V-b)^3} - \\frac{6a}{V^4} $$\nAt the critical point $(P_c, V_c, T_c)$, these derivatives must be zero. This gives us a system of two equations:\n$$ -\\frac{RT_c}{(V_c-b)^2} + \\frac{2a}{V_c^3} = 0 \\implies \\frac{RT_c}{(V_c-b)^2} = \\frac{2a}{V_c^3} \\quad (1) $$\n$$ \\frac{2RT_c}{(V_c-b)^3} - \\frac{6a}{V_c^4} = 0 \\implies \\frac{2RT_c}{(V_c-b)^3} = \\frac{6a}{V_c^4} \\quad (2) $$\nTo solve for $V_c$, we can divide equation $(2)$ by equation $(1)$:\n$$ \\frac{2RT_c/(V_c-b)^3}{RT_c/(V_c-b)^2} = \\frac{6a/V_c^4}{2a/V_c^3} $$\n$$ \\frac{2}{V_c-b} = \\frac{3}{V_c} $$\nSolving this simple algebraic equation yields the critical molar volume in terms of the parameter $b$:\n$$ 2V_c = 3(V_c - b) \\implies 2V_c = 3V_c - 3b \\implies V_c = 3b $$\nNext, we substitute this result for $V_c$ back into equation $(1)$ to find the critical temperature $T_c$:\n$$ \\frac{RT_c}{(3b-b)^2} = \\frac{2a}{(3b)^3} $$\n$$ \\frac{RT_c}{(2b)^2} = \\frac{2a}{27b^3} $$\n$$ \\frac{RT_c}{4b^2} = \\frac{2a}{27b^3} \\implies RT_c = \\frac{8ab^2}{27b^3} = \\frac{8a}{27b} $$\nSo, the critical temperature is $T_c = \\frac{8a}{27Rb}$.\nWith $V_c$ and $T_c$ determined, we find the critical pressure $P_c$ by substituting them into the equation for pressure:\n$$ P_c = \\frac{RT_c}{V_c-b} - \\frac{a}{V_c^2} = \\frac{R}{3b-b} \\left( \\frac{8a}{27Rb} \\right) - \\frac{a}{(3b)^2} $$\n$$ P_c = \\frac{1}{2b} \\frac{8a}{27b} - \\frac{a}{9b^2} = \\frac{4a}{27b^2} - \\frac{a}{9b^2} = \\frac{4a - 3a}{27b^2} = \\frac{a}{27b^2} $$\nThe critical compressibility factor, $Z_c$, is defined as $Z_c \\equiv \\frac{P_c V_c}{R T_c}$. We substitute the expressions for the critical constants $P_c$, $V_c$, and $T_c$:\n$$ Z_c = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{a}{27b^2}\\right)(3b)}{R\\left(\\frac{8a}{27Rb}\\right)} = \\frac{\\frac{3ab}{27b^2}}{\\frac{8aR}{27Rb}} = \\frac{\\frac{a}{9b}}{\\frac{8a}{27b}} $$\nThe substance-specific parameters $a$ and $b$ cancel, demonstrating universality:\n$$ Z_c = \\left(\\frac{a}{9b}\\right) \\left(\\frac{27b}{8a}\\right) = \\frac{27}{72} = \\frac{3}{8} $$\nThus, the van der Waals model predicts a universal value for the critical compressibility factor, $Z_c = \\frac{3}{8} = 0.375$.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Root-Mean-Square Deviation**\n\nWe are asked to compute the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of a set of $N=8$ experimental values of $Z_c$ from the theoretical value $Z_{c, \\text{vdw}} = 0.375$.

We calculate the required partial derivatives (sensitivity coefficients):\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial (\\ln \\phi)}{\\partial T} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\left( \\frac{P_1 v_0}{RT} - \\frac{P_1}{P_0} \\right) = -\\frac{P_1 v_0}{R T^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial (\\ln \\phi)}{\\partial P_0} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial P_0} \\left( \\frac{P_1 v_0}{RT} - \\frac{P_1}{P_0} \\right) = \\frac{P_1}{P_0^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial (\\ln \\phi)}{\\partial v_0} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v_0} \\left( \\frac{P_1 v_0}{RT} - \\frac{P_1}{P_0} \\right) = \\frac{P_1}{RT}\n$$\nThe combined uncertainty squared is therefore:\n$$\nu^2(\\ln \\phi) = \\left( -\\frac{P_1 v_0}{R T^2} \\right)^2 u^2(T) + \\left( \\frac{P_1}{P_0^2} \\right)^2 u^2(P_0) + \\left( \\frac{P_1}{RT} \\right)^2 u^2(v_0)\n$$\n$$\nu^2(\\ln \\phi) = \\frac{P_1^2 v_0^2}{R^2 T^4} u^2(T) + \\frac{P_1^2}{P_0^4} u^2(P_0) + \\frac{P_1^2}{R^2 T^2} u^2(v_0)\n$$\nWe now perform the numerical calculation using SI units to ensure consistency.\nThe given data are:\n$T = 300.00\\,\\mathrm{K}$ with $u(T) = 0.05\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n$P_0 = 1.0000\\,\\mathrm{bar} = 1.0000 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$ with $u(P_0) = 0.0020\\,\\mathrm{bar} = 200\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n$v_0 = 24.790\\,\\mathrm{L\\,mol^{-1}} = 2.4790 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,mol^{-1}}$ with $u(v_0) = 0.010\\,\\mathrm{L\\,mol^{-1}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,mol^{-1}}$\n$P_1 = 5.000\\,\\mathrm{bar} = 5.000 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n$R = 8.314462618\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n\nWe calculate each term's contribution to the variance $u^2(\\ln \\phi)$:\nContribution from $T$:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{P_1^2 v_0^2}{R^2 T^4} \\right) u^2(T) = \\frac{(5.000 \\times 10^5)^2 (2.4790 \\times 10^{-2})^2}{(8.31446)^2 (300.00)^4} (0.05)^2 \\approx 6.859 \\times 10^{-7}\n$$\nContribution from $P_0$:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{P_1^2}{P_0^4} \\right) u^2(P_0) = \\frac{(5.000 \\times 10^5)^2}{(1.0000 \\times 10^5)^4} (200)^2 = 1.000 \\times 10^{-4}\n$$\nContribution from $v_0$:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{P_1^2}{R^2 T^2} \\right) u^2(v_0) = \\frac{(5.000 \\times 10^5)^2}{(8.31446)^2 (300.00)^2} (1.0 \\times 10^{-5})^2 \\approx 4.018 \\times 10^{-6}\n$$\nThe combined variance is the sum of these contributions:\n$$\nu^2(\\ln \\phi) = (6.859 \\times 10^{-7}) + (1.000 \\times 10^{-4}) + (4.018 \\times 10^{-6}) \\approx 1.0470 \\times 10^{-4}\n$$\nThe combined standard uncertainty is the square root of the variance:\n$$\nu(\\ln \\phi) = \\sqrt{1.0470 \\times 10^{-4}} \\approx 0.010232\n$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, as required by the problem statement, we obtain the final answer.",
