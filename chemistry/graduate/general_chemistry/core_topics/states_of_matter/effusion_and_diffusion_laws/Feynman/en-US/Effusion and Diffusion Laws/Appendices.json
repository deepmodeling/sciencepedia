            "introduction": "While Graham's law provides a convenient summary of effusion, it overlooks a subtle but important physical consequence. Because the rate of effusion depends on molecular speed, faster molecules have a higher probability of escaping, a selective process that has consequences for the energy of both the effused gas and the gas remaining behind. This exercise  challenges you to move beyond the simple inverse square root law and apply the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution directly to quantify the average kinetic energy of the effusing molecules, revealing the phenomenon of effusive cooling.",

            "problem": "Consider a thermally insulated, rigid container of fixed volume $V$ filled with an ideal monatomic gas at an initial temperature $T_0$. The container has a tiny pinhole of area $A$, and the gas is allowed to effuse into a perfect vacuum.\n\nAccording to the kinetic theory of gases, the distribution of molecular speeds is not uniform. The probability of finding a molecule with a speed between $v$ and $v+dv$ is given by the Maxwell-Boltzmann speed distribution function, $f(v)$:\n$$f(v) = 4\\pi \\left(\\frac{m}{2\\pi k_B T}\\right)^{3/2} v^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv^2}{2k_B T}\\right)$$\nwhere $m$ is the mass of a single gas molecule, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nThe rate at which molecules of a specific speed $v$ strike the container walls (and thus the pinhole) is proportional to their speed $v$. Consequently, faster molecules have a higher probability of escaping. This selective process, known as effusive cooling, causes the average kinetic energy of the remaining gas to decrease over time.\n\nCalculate the ratio of the average kinetic energy of a molecule that escapes through the pinhole to the initial average kinetic energy of a molecule inside the container. Let's denote the initial average kinetic energy inside the container as $\\langle KE \\rangle_{\\text{initial}}$. We are interested in the average kinetic energy of an effusing molecule, $\\langle KE \\rangle_{\\text{effusing}}$, at the very beginning of the process when the temperature of the gas inside is still $T_0$. Determine the exact value of the ratio $\\frac{\\langle KE \\rangle_{\\text{effusing}}}{\\langle KE \\rangle_{\\text{initial}}}$. The final answer should be a single, exact numerical value.",
            "solution": "At the initial temperature $T_{0}$, the average kinetic energy per molecule in the gas is given by equipartition:\n$$\\langle KE \\rangle_{\\text{initial}} = \\frac{3}{2} k_{B} T_{0}.$$\n\nThe number of molecules striking a unit area of the wall per unit time with speeds between $v$ and $v+dv$ is given by kinetic theory as $\\frac{1}{4} n v f(v) dv$, where $f(v)$ is the Maxwell-Boltzmann speed distribution function given in the problem statement, and $n$ is the number density.

            "solution": "The first task is to derive the functional dependence of the molar effusion rate, $r$, on the reservoir pressure $p$, temperature $T$, orifice area $A$, and the molar mass $M$ of the gas. We begin from fundamental principles as instructed.\n\nThe rate of effusion is determined by the flux of molecules colliding with the wall of the container. The wall-collision flux, $Z_w$, is the number of molecules striking a unit area of the wall per unit time. For a gas in thermal equilibrium, this flux is given by kinetic theory as:\n$$Z_w = \\frac{1}{4} n_V \\langle v \\rangle$$\nwhere $n_V$ is the number density (number of molecules per unit volume, $N/V$) and $\\langle v \\rangle$ is the mean speed of the molecules.\n\nUnder the assumption of ideal-gas behavior, the number density $n_V$ can be related to the macroscopic properties of pressure $p$ and temperature $T$ through the ideal gas law, $pV = N k_B T$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. Rearranging for $n_V$ gives:\n$$n_V = \\frac{N}{V} = \\frac{p}{k_B T}$$\n\nThe mean speed $\\langle v \\rangle$ for a gas following the Maxwell–Boltzmann speed distribution is given by:\n$$\\langle v \\rangle = \\sqrt{\\frac{8 k_B T}{\\pi m}}$$\nwhere $m$ is the mass of a single gas molecule.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $n_V$ and $\\langle v \\rangle$ into the formula for $Z_w$:\n$$Z_w = \\frac{1}{4} \\left(\\frac{p}{k_B T}\\right) \\sqrt{\\frac{8 k_B T}{\\pi m}} = \\frac{p}{k_B T} \\sqrt{\\frac{8 k_B T}{16 \\pi m}} = p \\sqrt{\\frac{8 k_B T}{16 \\pi m (k_B T)^2}} = \\frac{p}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi m k_B T}}$$\n\nThe number of molecules effusing through an orifice of area $A$ per unit time, $\\frac{dN}{dt}$, is the product of the collision flux and the area, assuming the orifice is small enough not to perturb the equilibrium distribution.\n$$\\frac{dN}{dt} = Z_w A = \\frac{pA}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi m k_B T}}$$\n\nThe problem requires the molar effusion rate, $r$, which is the number of moles effusing per unit time. This is obtained by dividing the molecular rate by Avogadro's constant, $N_A$.\n$$r = \\frac{1}{N_A} \\frac{dN}{dt} = \\frac{pA}{N_A \\sqrt{2 \\pi m k_B T}}$$\n\nTo express this in terms of molar mass $M$ and the universal gas constant $R$, we use the relations $M = m N_A$ and $R = k_B N_A$. Substituting $m = M/N_A$ and $k_B = R/N_A$:\n$$r = \\frac{pA}{N_A \\sqrt{2 \\pi \\left(\\frac{M}{N_A}\\right) \\left(\\frac{R}{N_A}\\right) T}} = \\frac{pA}{N_A \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\pi M R T}{N_A^2}}} = \\frac{pA}{N_A \\frac{\\sqrt{2 \\pi M R T}}{N_A}}$$\nThis simplifies to the final expression for the molar effusion rate:\n$$r = \\frac{pA}{\\sqrt{2 \\pi M R T}}$$\nThis is the required functional dependence, known as the Hertz–Knudsen equation for effusion.\n\nNext, we rearrange this equation to solve for the molar mass $M$ in terms of the measurable quantities.\n$$\\sqrt{2 \\pi M R T} = \\frac{pA}{r}$$\nSquaring both sides gives:\n$$2 \\pi M R T = \\left(\\frac{pA}{r}\\right)^2$$\nIsolating $M$ yields:\n$$M = \\frac{1}{2 \\pi R T} \\left(\\frac{pA}{r}\\right)^2 = \\frac{p^2 A^2}{2 \\pi R T r^2}$$\n\nNow, we derive the expression for the combined relative standard uncertainty of $M$, denoted $u_{\\mathrm{rel}}(M) = u(M)/M$. The variables $p$, $T$, $A$, and $r$ are given as uncorrelated. For a function of the form $M = C \\cdot p^a T^b A^c r^d$, where $C$ is a constant, the first-order uncertainty propagation formula for uncorrelated variables gives the squared relative uncertainty as:\n$$u_{\\mathrm{rel}}(M)^2 = \\left(a \\cdot u_{\\mathrm{rel}}(p)\\right)^2 + \\left(b \\cdot u_{\\mathrm{rel}}(T)\\right)^2 + \\left(c \\cdot u_{\\mathrm{rel}}(A)\\right)^2 + \\left(d \\cdot u_{\\mathrm{rel}}(r)\\right)^2$$\nOur expression for $M$ is $M = (2 \\pi R)^{-1} p^2 T^{-1} A^2 r^{-2}$. The exponents are $a=2$, $b=-1$, $c=2$, and $d=-2$. Therefore, the analytic expression for the relative uncertainty in $M$ is:\n$$u_{\\mathrm{rel}}(M)^2 = (2 \\cdot u_{\\mathrm{rel}}(p))^2 + (-1 \\cdot u_{\\mathrm{rel}}(T))^2 + (2 \\cdot u_{\\mathrm{rel}}(A))^2 + (-2 \\cdot u_{\\mathrm{rel}}(r))^2$$\n$$u_{\\mathrm{rel}}(M) = \\sqrt{4 u_{\\mathrm{rel}}(p)^2 + u_{\\mathrm{rel}}(T)^2 + 4 u_{\\mathrm{rel}}(A)^2 + 4 u_{\\mathrm{rel}}(r)^2}$$\n\nFinally, we evaluate this expression numerically. We first calculate the individual relative standard uncertainties from the given data.\n- For pressure $p$:\n  $u_{\\mathrm{rel}}(p) = \\frac{u(p)}{p} = \\frac{0.090 \\,\\text{kPa}}{18.000 \\,\\text{kPa}} = 0.005$\n- For temperature $T$:\n  $u_{\\mathrm{rel}}(T) = \\frac{u(T)}{T} = \\frac{0.50 \\,\\text{K}}{310.00 \\,\\text{K}} = \\frac{1}{620} \\approx 0.0016129$\n- For area $A$:\n  $u_{\\mathrm{rel}}(A) = \\frac{u(A)}{A} = \\frac{0.0120 \\times 10^{-8} \\,\\text{m}^2}{1.2000 \\times 10^{-8} \\,\\text{m}^2} = 0.01$\n- For the molar rate $r = \\Delta n / \\Delta t$:\n  The uncertainty in $\\Delta n$ is negligible.
