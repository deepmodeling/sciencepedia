            "problem": "A chemical engineer is investigating the synthesis of hydrogen iodide, $HI(g)$, from its constituent elements in a sealed, rigid reaction vessel of fixed volume. The process begins by introducing an equimolar mixture of hydrogen gas, $H_2(g)$, and iodine vapor, $I_2(g)$, into the vessel. The initial total pressure of this gaseous mixture is measured to be $P_0$. The vessel is then heated to a high, constant temperature, allowing the reaction to reach equilibrium:\n\n$$H_2(g) + I_2(g) \\rightleftharpoons 2HI(g)$$\n\nThe gas-phase equilibrium constant for this reaction at the operating temperature is denoted by $K_p$. Assuming all species behave as ideal gases, derive a symbolic expression for the partial pressure of hydrogen gas, $P_{H_2}$, when the system has reached equilibrium. Your final expression should be solely in terms of the initial total pressure $P_0$ and the equilibrium constant $K_p$.",

By stoichiometry and symmetry, $P_{I_{2}} = p$, and since the total pressure is $P_{0}$, the partial pressure of $HI$ is\n$$\nP_{HI} = P_{0} - P_{H_{2}} - P_{I_{2}} = P_{0} - 2p.\n$$\n\nFor ideal gases, the equilibrium constant in terms of partial pressures is\n$$\nK_{p} = \\frac{(P_{HI})^{2}}{P_{H_{2}}\\,P_{I_{2}}} = \\frac{(P_{0} - 2p)^{2}}{p^{2}}.\n$$\nTaking the principal square root (the ratio is nonnegative at equilibrium),\n$$\n\\sqrt{K_{p}} = \\frac{P_{0} - 2p}{p}.\n$$\nSolving for $p$,\n$$\n\\sqrt{K_{p}}\\,p = P_{0} - 2p \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad p\\left(\\sqrt{K_{p}} + 2\\right) = P_{0} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad p = \\frac{P_{0}}{2 + \\sqrt{K_{p}}}.\n$$\nThus, the equilibrium partial pressure of hydrogen is\n$$\nP_{H_{2}} = \\frac{P_{0}}{2 + \\sqrt{K_{p}}}.\n$$\nThis expression has the correct limiting behavior: as $K_{p} \\to 0$, $P_{H_{2}} \\to \\frac{P_{0}}{2}$; as $K_{p} \\to \\infty$, $P_{H_{2}} \\to 0$.",

In the second virial framework, the deviation from volume additivity to leading order is governed by $y_A B_A + y_B B_B - B_{\\mathrm{mix}} = 2 y_A y_B\\big(\\tfrac{B_A + B_B}{2} - B_{AB}\\big)$. When the unlike interaction encoded in $B_{AB}$ equals the arithmetic mean of the like interactions $B_A$ and $B_B$, the mixture’s two-body nonideality is, to this order, indistinguishable from the linear average of the pure components, so the Amagat construction becomes exact to leading nonideal order. By contrast, Dalton’s law at common volume and temperature misses the cross contribution $2 y_A y_B B_{AB}\\,\\rho^2$ to the pressure that arises from unlike $A$–$B$ pairs; unless $B_{AB} = 0$, this cross term makes the sum of pure-component pressures differ from the true mixture pressure. For gases with similar sizes and interaction strengths (so that $B_{AB} \\approx \\tfrac{1}{2}(B_A + B_B)$ but $B_{AB} \\neq 0$), this yields an explicit scenario where Amagat’s law approximately holds while Dalton’s law fails to the same order.",
