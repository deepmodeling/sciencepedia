It is well-posed, providing all necessary information (reactants, products, medium) to arrive at a unique solution using the specified standard method. The language is objective and unambiguous. The problem is a straightforward, a non-trivial application of fundamental chemical principles. There are no contradictions, missing data, or pseudoscientific elements.\n\n**Verdict**\nThe problem is deemed valid and solvable.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe task is to balance the given redox reaction in an acidic medium using the half-reaction method. This process involves separating the overall reaction into two half-reactions: one for oxidation and one for reduction.\n\nFirst, we must identify the species being oxidized and reduced by assigning oxidation numbers.\n-   In the dichromate ion, $\\text{Cr}_2\\text{O}_7^{2-}$, oxygen has an oxidation number of $-2$. Let the oxidation number of chromium be $x$. The sum of oxidation numbers must equal the charge of the ion, which is $-2$. Thus, $2x + 7(-2) = -2$, which gives $2x - 14 = -2$, or $2x = 12$, so $x = +6$.\n-   In the chromium(III) ion, $\\text{Cr}^{3+}$, the oxidation number of chromium is $+3$.\n-   In the iodide ion, $\\text{I}^-$, the oxidation number of iodine is $-1$.\n-   In diatomic iodine, $\\text{I}_2$, the oxidation number of iodine is $0$.\n\nChromium's oxidation number decreases from $+6$ to $+3$; therefore, the dichromate ion is reduced.\nIodine's oxidation number increases from $-1$ to $0$; therefore, the iodide ion is oxidized.\n\nWe now construct and balance each half-reaction.\n\n**Reduction Half-Reaction:** $\\text{Cr}_2\\text{O}_7^{2-} \\rightarrow \\text{Cr}^{3+}$\n1.  Balance atoms other than oxygen and hydrogen. There are two $\\text{Cr}$ atoms on the left, so we need two on the right:\n    $$\n    \\text{Cr}_2\\text{O}_7^{2-} \\rightarrow 2\\text{Cr}^{3+}\n    $$\n2.  Balance oxygen atoms by adding water molecules, $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$. There are seven $\\text{O}$ atoms on the left, so we add seven $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ molecules to the right:\n    $$\n    \\text{Cr}_2\\text{O}_7^{2-} \\rightarrow 2\\text{Cr}^{3+} + 7\\text{H}_2\\text{O}\n    $$\n3.  Balance hydrogen atoms by adding hydrogen ions, $\\text{H}^+$, as the solution is acidic. There are $7 \\times 2 = 14$ hydrogen atoms on the right, so we add fourteen $\\text{H}^+$ ions to the left:\n    $$\n    14\\text{H}^+ + \\text{Cr}_2\\text{O}_7^{2-} \\rightarrow 2\\text{Cr}^{3+} + 7\\text{H}_2\\text{O}\n    $$\n4.  Balance the charge by adding electrons, $e^-$. The total charge on the left is $14(+1) + (-2) = +12$. The total charge on the right is $2(+3) + 7(0) = +6$. To balance the charge, we must add $6$ electrons to the left side:\n    $$\n    6e^- + 14\\text{H}^+ + \\text{Cr}_2\\text{O}_7^{2-} \\rightarrow 2\\text{Cr}^{3+} + 7\\text{H}_2\\text{O}\n    $$\nThis half-reaction is now fully balanced. Six electrons are consumed.\n\n**Oxidation Half-Reaction:** $\\text{I}^- \\rightarrow \\text{I}_2$\n1.  Balance atoms other than oxygen and hydrogen. There is one $\\text{I}$ atom on the left and two on the right, so we place a coefficient of $2$ before $\\text{I}^-$:\n    $$\n    2\\text{I}^- \\rightarrow \\text{I}_2\n    $$\n2.  Oxygen and hydrogen atoms are not present.\n3.  Balance the charge by adding electrons. The total charge on the left is $2(-1) = -2$. The total charge on the right is $0$. To balance the charge, we must add $2$ electrons to the right side:\n    $$\n    2\\text{I}^- \\rightarrow \\text{I}_2 + 2e^-\n    $$\nThis half-reaction is now fully balanced. Two electrons are produced.\n\nNow, we combine the two half-reactions. The number of electrons lost in oxidation must equal the number of electrons gained in reduction. The reduction half-reaction involves $6$ electrons, while the oxidation half-reaction involves $2$ electrons. The least common multiple of $6$ and $2$ is $6$. Therefore, we must multiply the oxidation half-reaction by $3$:\n$$\n3 \\times (2\\text{I}^- \\rightarrow \\text{I}_2 + 2e^-) \\implies 6\\text{I}^- \\rightarrow 3\\text{I}_2 + 6e^-\n$$\nThis explicitly verifies that the $6$ electrons produced by the oxidation of iodide are equal to the $6$ electrons consumed by the reduction of dichromate.\n\nWe now add the balanced reduction half-reaction and the scaled, balanced oxidation half-reaction:\n$$\n(6e^- + 14\\text{H}^+ + \\text{Cr}_2\\text{O}_7^{2-} \\rightarrow 2\\text{Cr}^{3+} + 7\\text{H}_2\\text{O}) \\\\\n+ (6\\text{I}^- \\rightarrow 3\\text{I}_2 + 6e^-)\n$$\nSumming these gives:\n$$\n6e^- + 14\\text{H}^+ + \\text{Cr}_2\\text{O}_7^{2-} + 6\\text{I}^- \\rightarrow 2\\text{Cr}^{3+} + 7\\text{H}_2\\text{O} + 3\\text{I}_2 + 6e^-\n$$\nFinally, we cancel the species that appear on both sides of the equation, which are the $6$ electrons:\n$$\n14\\text{H}^+ + \\text{Cr}_2\\text{O}_7^{2-} + 6\\text{I}^- \\rightarrow 2\\text{Cr}^{3+} + 3\\text{I}_2 + 7\\text{H}_2\\text{O}\n$$\nThis is the fully balanced net ionic equation with the smallest whole-number stoichiometric coefficients.\n\nLet us verify the balance of atoms and charge in the final equation.\n-   Atoms:\n    -   $\\text{H}$: $14$ on the left, $7 \\times 2 = 14$ on the right.

The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary chemical species and the reaction medium, which allows for a unique solution in the form of a balanced chemical equation with the smallest integer coefficients. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the specified criteria for invalidity.\n\nStep 3: Verdict\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe task is to balance the given redox reaction using the half-reaction method in a basic medium.\n\nFirst, we determine the oxidation numbers of the elements undergoing changes to identify the oxidation and reduction half-reactions.\nFor the nitrite ion, $\\text{NO}_2^-$, the oxidation number of oxygen is $-2$. Let the oxidation number of nitrogen be $x$. The sum must equal the charge of the ion, $-1$. Thus, $x + 2(-2) = -1$, which gives $x = +3$.\nFor ammonia, $\\text{NH}_3$, the oxidation number of hydrogen is $+1$. Let the oxidation number of nitrogen be $y$. The sum must equal the charge of the molecule, $0$. Thus, $y + 3(+1) = 0$, which gives $y = -3$.\nThe oxidation number of nitrogen decreases from $+3$ to $-3$, so the conversion of $\\text{NO}_2^-$ to $\\text{NH}_3$ is the reduction half-reaction.\n\nFor metallic aluminum, $\\text{Al}$, its oxidation number in the elemental state is $0$.\nFor the tetrahydroxoaluminate ion, $\\text{Al(OH)}_4^-$, each hydroxide group $\\text{OH}^-$ has a charge of $-1$. Let the oxidation number of aluminum be $z$. The sum must equal the charge of the ion, $-1$. Thus, $z + 4(-1) = -1$, which gives $z = +3$.\nThe oxidation number of aluminum increases from $0$ to $+3$, so the conversion of $\\text{Al}$ to $\\text{Al(OH)}_4^-$ is the oxidation half-reaction.\n\nWe will balance each half-reaction separately.\n\nReduction Half-Reaction: $\\text{NO}_2^- \\to \\text{NH}_3$\n$1.$ Balance atoms other than oxygen and hydrogen. The nitrogen atom count is already balanced ($1$ on each side).\n$2.$ Balance oxygen atoms. There are $2$ oxygen atoms on the left. We add $2$ molecules of $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ to the right to balance them.\n$$\\text{NO}_2^- \\to \\text{NH}_3 + 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$$\n$3.$ Balance hydrogen atoms.

We neutralize the $\\text{H}^+$ ions by adding an equal number of $\\text{OH}^-$ ions to both sides of the equation. We add $7$ $\\text{OH}^-$ ions to each side.\n$$7\\text{OH}^- + 7\\text{H}^+ + \\text{NO}_2^- \\to \\text{NH}_3 + 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O} + 7\\text{OH}^-$$\n$5.$ The $\\text{H}^+$ and $\\text{OH}^-$ ions on the left combine to form water: $7\\text{H}^+ + 7\\text{OH}^- \\to 7\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$.\n$$7\\text{H}_2\\text{O} + \\text{NO}_2^- \\to \\text{NH}_3 + 2\\text{H}_2\\text{O} + 7\\text{OH}^-$$\n$6.$ Simplify the equation by canceling $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ molecules that appear on both sides.

The gain of $6$ electrons corresponds to the change in oxidation state of nitrogen from $+3$ to $-3$, which is a decrease of $6$, confirming consistency.\n\nOxidation Half-Reaction: $\\text{Al} \\to \\text{Al(OH)}_4^-$\n$1.$ Balance atoms other than oxygen and hydrogen. The aluminum atom count is balanced ($1$ on each side).\n$2.$ Balance the oxygen and hydrogen atoms. The right side has $4$ oxygen atoms and $4$ hydrogen atoms, all within hydroxide units. In a basic solution, the source of these is the hydroxide ion, $\\text{OH}^-$. We add $4$ $\\text{OH}^-$ ions to the left side.\n$$4\\text{OH}^- + \\text{Al} \\to \\text{Al(OH)}_4^-$$\nThe atoms are now balanced: $1$ $\\text{Al}$, $4$ $\\text{O}$, and $4$ $\\text{H}$ on each side.\n$3.$ Balance the charge. The total charge on the left is $4 \\times (-1) = -4$. The total charge on the right is $-1$.

The loss of $3$ electrons corresponds to the change in oxidation state of aluminum from $0$ to $+3$, which is an increase of $3$, confirming consistency.\n\nNext, we combine the two half-reactions. The number of electrons lost in oxidation must equal the number of electrons gained in reduction. The reduction involves $6$ electrons, while the oxidation involves $3$ electrons.
