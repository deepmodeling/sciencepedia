            "solution": "The problem as stated is valid: it is scientifically grounded in the theory of chemical bonding, well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and formulated objectively. A rigorous solution can be derived from the provided premises.\n\nThe objective is to find the angle $\\theta$ between any two equivalent $\\mathrm{sp}^n$ hybrid orbitals. Let these two distinct orbitals be denoted by $|h_i\\rangle$ and $|h_j\\rangle$, with $i \\neq j$.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, an equivalent hybrid orbital $|h\\rangle$ can be written as a linear combination of atomic orbitals. Let us define a normalized p-orbital component $|p_{\\vec{u}}\\rangle$ that is oriented along a real-space unit vector $\\vec{u}$ with direction cosines $(\\ell, m, n')$:\n$$|p_{\\vec{u}}\\rangle = \\ell|p_x\\rangle + m|p_y\\rangle + n'|p_z\\rangle$$\nHere, we use $n'$ for the z-direction cosine to avoid ambiguity with the hybridization index $n$, although the problem statement uses $n$ for both. The unit vector nature of $(\\ell, m, n')$ implies $\\ell^2 + m^2 + (n')^2 = 1$. The hybrid orbital is then given as:\n$$|h\\rangle = c_s|s\\rangle + c_p|p_{\\vec{u}}\\rangle$$\nThe coefficients $c_s$ and $c_p$ are real numbers.\n\nFirst, we apply the normalization condition for the hybrid orbital, $\\langle h|h\\rangle=1$.\n$$\\langle h|h\\rangle = \\langle c_s s + c_p p_{\\vec{u}} | c_s s + c_p p_{\\vec{u}} \\rangle = c_s^2 \\langle s|s\\rangle + c_p^2 \\langle p_{\\vec{u}}|p_{\\vec{u}}\\rangle + 2c_s c_p \\operatorname{Re}\\langle s|p_{\\vec{u}}\\rangle$$\nThe basis $\\{|s\\rangle, |p_x\\rangle, |p_y\\rangle, |p_z\\rangle\\}$ is orthonormal. This means $\\langle s|s\\rangle=1$, $\\langle p_\\alpha|p_\\beta\\rangle=\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}$, and $\\langle s|p_\\alpha\\rangle=0$. Consequently, the inner product of $|s\\rangle$ and $|p_{\\vec{u}}\\rangle$ is zero:\n$$\\langle s|p_{\\vec{u}}\\rangle = \\ell\\langle s|p_x\\rangle + m\\langle s|p_y\\rangle + n'\\langle s|p_z\\rangle = 0$$\nThe p-orbital component $|p_{\\vec{u}}\\rangle$ is itself normalized due to the orthonormality of the $|p_\\alpha\\rangle$ basis and the property of direction cosines:\n$$\\langle p_{\\vec{u}}|p_{\\vec{u}}\\rangle = \\ell^2\\langle p_x|p_x\\rangle + m^2\\langle p_y|p_y\\rangle + (n')^2\\langle p_z|p_z\\rangle = \\ell^2 + m^2 + (n')^2 = 1$$\nTherefore, the normalization condition for $|h\\rangle$ simplifies to a relation between the squares of the coefficients:\n$$c_s^2 + c_p^2 = 1$$\n\nNext, we incorporate the definition of $\\mathrm{sp}^n$ hybridization, which dictates that the ratio of the total p-character to the total s-character is $n:1$. This is expressed as:\n$$\\frac{c_p^2}{c_s^2} = n$$\nWe now possess a system of two algebraic equations for $c_s^2$ and $c_p^2$:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nc_s^2 + c_p^2 = 1 \\\\\nc_p^2 = n c_s^2\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nSubstituting the second equation into the first gives $c_s^2 + n c_s^2 = 1$, which leads to $(1+n)c_s^2 = 1$. Solving for the squared coefficients, we find:\n$$c_s^2 = \\frac{1}{1+n}$$\n$$c_p^2 = n c_s^2 = \\frac{n}{1+n}$$\n\nNow, let us consider the two distinct orbitals $|h_i\\rangle$ and $|h_j\\rangle$. They are oriented along different directions, defined by unit vectors $\\vec{u}_i$ and $\\vec{u}_j$.\n$$|h_i\\rangle = c_s|s\\rangle + c_p|p_{\\vec{u}_i}\\rangle$$\n$$|h_j\\rangle = c_s|s\\rangle + c_p|p_{\\vec{u}_j}\\rangle$$\nThe problem states that these orbitals are orthogonal, meaning their inner product is zero: $\\langle h_i|h_j\\rangle = 0$.\n$$\\langle h_i|h_j\\rangle = \\langle c_s s + c_p p_{\\vec{u}_i} | c_s s + c_p p_{\\vec{u}_j} \\rangle = c_s^2 \\langle s|s\\rangle + c_p^2 \\langle p_{\\vec{u}_i}|p_{\\vec{u}_j}\\rangle + c_s c_p (\\langle s|p_{\\vec{u}_j}\\rangle + \\langle p_{\\vec{u}_i}|s\\rangle) = 0$$\nSince $\\langle s|s\\rangle=1$ and the cross terms involving $|s\\rangle$ and $|p_{\\vec{u}}\\rangle$ are zero, this equation reduces to:\n$$c_s^2 + c_p^2 \\langle p_{\\vec{u}_i}|p_{\\vec{u}_j}\\rangle = 0$$\n\nThe remaining task is to evaluate the inner product $\\langle p_{\\vec{u}_i}|p_{\\vec{u}_j}\\rangle$. The vectors $|p_{\\vec{u}_i}\\rangle$ and $|p_{\\vec{u}_j}\\rangle$ are linear combinations of the orthonormal $|p_\\alpha\\rangle$ orbitals. Their inner product is equivalent to the scalar product of their respective direction vectors in real space, $\\vec{u}_i \\cdot \\vec{u}_j$. If $\\theta$ is the angle between these unit vectors, then from vector algebra:\n$$\\langle p_{\\vec{u}_i}|p_{\\vec{u}_j}\\rangle = \\vec{u}_i \\cdot \\vec{u}_j = |\\vec{u}_i||\\vec{u}_j|\\cos\\theta = \\cos\\theta$$\nSubstituting this into the orthogonality condition gives:\n$$c_s^2 + c_p^2 \\cos\\theta = 0$$\nSolving for $\\cos\\theta$ yields:\n$$\\cos\\theta = -\\frac{c_s^2}{c_p^2}$$\nWe previously established that $c_p^2/c_s^2 = n$. Therefore, the ratio $c_s^2/c_p^2$ is simply $1/n$.\n$$\\cos\\theta = -\\frac{1}{n}$$\nThis elegant result relates the interaxial angle directly to the hybridization index $n$. To obtain the angle $\\theta$ itself, we take the arc-cosine of this expression.\n$$\\theta(n) = \\arccos\\left(-\\frac{1}{n}\\right)$$\nThis expression is valid for the given domain $n \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, as the argument of the arc-cosine function, $-1/n$, falls within the required range of $[-1, 1]$.\nFor $n=1$ ($sp$): $\\theta = \\arccos(-1) = \\pi$ radians ($180^\\circ$).\nFor $n=2$ ($sp^2$): $\\theta = \\arccos(-1/2) = 2\\pi/3$ radians ($120^\\circ$).\nFor $n=3$ ($sp^3$): $\\theta = \\arccos(-1/3) \\approx 1.91$ radians ($109.47^\\circ$).\nThe derivation is complete and provides the required closed-form analytic expression.",

This practice uses the water molecule to explore non-equivalent hybridization, a key concept for understanding deviations from ideal geometries . You will reason from the principle of orbital orthogonality that lone pairs, being more tightly bound to the nucleus, preferentially occupy hybrids with greater $s$-character. This enrichment of $s$-character in the lone pair orbitals forces the bonding orbitals into hybrids with less $s$-character, thereby compressing the H–O–H bond angle to be less than the ideal tetrahedral angle.

The angle between $\\lvert h_1 \\rangle$ and $\\lvert h_2 \\rangle$ is the bond angle $\\theta$.\n\nDue to the $C_{2v}$ symmetry of the water molecule, the two bond-directed hybrids must be equivalent, as must the two lone-pair hybrids.\nLet $s_b = \\alpha_1^2 = \\alpha_2^2$ be the $s$-character of the bond-directed hybrids.\nLet $s_{lp} = \\alpha_3^2 = \\alpha_4^2$ be the $s$-character of the lone-pair hybrids.\n\nThe fundamental basis of orthonormality, $\\langle h_i \\vert h_j\\rangle = \\delta_{ij}$, is applied to the two bond-directed hybrids, $\\lvert h_1 \\rangle$ and $\\lvert h_2 \\rangle$.\n$\\lvert h_1 \\rangle = \\alpha_1 \\lvert 2s \\rangle + \\beta_1 \\lvert p_1 \\rangle$\n$\\lvert h_2 \\rangle = \\alpha_2 \\lvert 2s \\rangle + \\beta_2 \\lvert p_2 \\rangle$\nwhere $\\lvert p_1 \\rangle$ and $\\lvert p_2 \\rangle$ are normalized directional $p$-orbitals.

The conservation of $s$-character is given as $\\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\alpha_i^2 = 1$, which for water becomes $2s_b + 2s_{lp} = 1$.\nIf $s_{lp} > 1/4$, then $2s_{lp} > 1/2$.\nFrom the conservation rule, $2s_b = 1 - 2s_{lp} < 1 - 1/2 = 1/2$.\nTherefore, $s_b < 1/4$.\nThe assignment of enhanced $s$-character to lone-pair orbitals necessitates a corresponding decrease in the $s$-character of the bond-directed orbitals.\n\nNow, we analyze the effect on the bond angle $\\theta$. The function $\\cos\\theta(s_b) = -\\frac{s_b}{1-s_b}$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $s_b$ for $s_b \\in [0, 1]$.\nSince $s_b < 1/4$, it follows that $\\cos\\theta(s_b) > \\cos\\theta(1/4)$.\n$$ \\cos\\theta > -1/3 $$\nThe cosine function is decreasing for $\\theta \\in [0^\\circ, 180^\\circ]$. Therefore, an increase in the value of $\\cos\\theta$ corresponds to a decrease in the angle $\\theta$.\n$$ \\theta < \\arccos(-1/3) \\approx 109.47^\\circ $$\nConclusion: Assigning more $s$-character to the lone pairs compresses the bond angle to a value less than the tetrahedral angle.\n\nFinally, we use the experimental bond angle $\\theta \\approx 104.5^\\circ$ to estimate the $s$-character fractions.\n$$ \\cos(104.5^\\circ) \\approx -0.25038 $$\nFrom our derived relation:\n$$ -0.25038 \\approx -\\frac{s_b}{1-s_b} $$\n$$ 0.25038(1 - s_b) \\approx s_b $$\n$$ 0.25038 \\approx s_b + 0.25038 s_b = 1.25038 s_b $$\n$$ s_b \\approx \\frac{0.25038}{1.25038} \\approx 0.2002 \\approx 0.20 $$\nThe $s$-character of the bond-directed hybrids is approximately $20\\%$.\nUsing the conservation rule $2s_b + 2s_{lp} = 1$, we find the $s$-character of the lone-pair hybrids:\n$$ s_{lp} = \\frac{1 - 2s_b}{2} = 0.5 - s_b $$\n$$ s_{lp} \\approx 0.5 - 0.20 = 0.30 $$\nThe $s$-character of the lone-pair hybrids is approximately $30\\%$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A.

It is based on standard principles of quantum chemistry, specifically Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO) and density matrix theory as applied in Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis. The data provided is complete and internally consistent. The task is a direct application of these principles to a concrete, albeit simplified, chemical system. The problem is not trivial, as it requires correct interpretation of the density matrix and its relation to orbital coefficients and hybridization. The problem is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the determination of the $s$- and $p$-character of the carbon natural hybrid orbital participating in a $\\mathrm{C}\\!-\\!\\mathrm{H}$ bond. We are given the contribution of this bond to the one-particle density matrix, $\\mathbf{D}$.\n\nThe bonding molecular orbital, $|\\psi\\rangle$, is expressed as a column vector $\\mathbf{c}$ of its coefficients in the specified AO basis $\\{\\,|\\chi_1\\rangle, |\\chi_2\\rangle, |\\chi_3\\rangle, |\\chi_4\\rangle, |\\chi_5\\rangle\\,\\} = \\{\\,\\mathrm{C}\\,2s,\\ \\mathrm{C}\\,2p_x,\\ \\mathrm{C}\\,2p_y,\\ \\mathrm{C}\\,2p_z,\\ \\mathrm{H}\\,1s\\,\\}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{c} = \\begin{pmatrix} a_s \\\\ a_x \\\\ a_y \\\\ a_z \\\\ b \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe density matrix $\\mathbf{D}$ for a single, doubly-occupied, real orbital is given by the outer product $\\mathbf{D} = 2\\,\\mathbf{c}\\mathbf{c}^T$. The elements of the density matrix are therefore $D_{ij} = 2 c_i c_j$.\n\nFirst, we must reconstruct the coefficient vector $\\mathbf{c}$ from the given matrix $\\mathbf{D}$. The diagonal elements $D_{ii} = 2 c_i^2$ give the magnitude of the coefficients:\n-   $D_{11} = \\frac{1}{2} = 2 a_s^2 \\implies a_s^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\implies |a_s| = \\frac{1}{2}$\n-   $D_{22} = 0 = 2 a_x^2 \\implies a_x = 0$\n-   $D_{33} = 0 = 2 a_y^2 \\implies a_y = 0$\n-   $D_{44} = \\frac{1}{2} = 2 a_z^2 \\implies a_z^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\implies |a_z| = \\frac{1}{2}$\n-   $D_{55} = 1 = 2 b^2 \\implies b^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\implies |b| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$\n\nThe off-diagonal elements determine the relative signs of the coefficients. Let us examine $D_{14} = 2 a_s a_z = \\frac{1}{2}$. Since this value is positive, $a_s$ and $a_z$ must have the same sign.\nLet us examine $D_{15} = 2 a_s b = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$. Since this is positive, $a_s$ and $b$ must also have the same sign.\nThe overall phase of the orbital $|\\psi\\rangle$ is arbitrary. We can choose the convention that the coefficient $a_s$ is positive.\nIf $a_s = +\\frac{1}{2}$, then it follows that $a_z = +\\frac{1}{2}$ and $b = +\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nThe full coefficient vector for the bonding orbital $|\\psi\\rangle$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\mathbf{c} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/2 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1/2 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe can verify that the orbital is normalized as required: $\\langle\\psi|\\psi\\rangle = \\mathbf{c}^T \\mathbf{c} = a_s^2 + a_x^2 + a_y^2 + a_z^2 + b^2 = (\\frac{1}{2})^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 + (\\frac{1}{2})^2 + (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})^2 = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1$. The reconstruction is correct.\n\nThe bonding orbital is:\n$$\n|\\psi\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}\\,|\\mathrm{C}\\,2s\\rangle + \\frac{1}{2}\\,|\\mathrm{C}\\,2p_z\\rangle + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\,|\\mathrm{H}\\,1s\\rangle\n$$\nThe natural hybrid orbital on the carbon atom, which we denote $|h_C\\rangle$, is the part of $|\\psi\\rangle$ constructed from the carbon AOs:\n$$\n|h_C\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}\\,|\\mathrm{C}\\,2s\\rangle + \\frac{1}{2}\\,|\\mathrm{C}\\,2p_z\\rangle\n$$\nTo determine the $s$- and $p$-character, this hybrid orbital must be normalized. The squared norm is:\n$$\n\\langle h_C | h_C \\rangle = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThe normalization factor is $N = (\\langle h_C | h_C \\rangle)^{-1/2} = (\\frac{1}{2})^{-1/2} = \\sqrt{2}$.\nThe normalized carbon hybrid, $|\\chi_C\\rangle$, is:\n$$\n|\\chi_C\\rangle = N |h_C\\rangle = \\sqrt{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\,|\\mathrm{C}\\,2s\\rangle + \\frac{1}{2}\\,|\\mathrm{C}\\,2p_z\\rangle \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\,|\\mathrm{C}\\,2s\\rangle + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\,|\\mathrm{C}\\,2p_z\\rangle\n$$\nLet the coefficients of the normalized hybrid be $c_s', c_{p_x}', c_{p_y}', c_{p_z}'$. Here, $c_s' = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$, $c_{p_x}' = 0$, $c_{p_y}' = 0$, and $c_{p_z}' = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\nThe $s$-character is the fractional population of the $s$ orbital in the normalized hybrid, which is given by $(c_s')^2$:\n$$\ns\\text{-character} = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThe $p$-character is the total fractional population of the $p$ orbitals, which is given by $(c_{p_x}')^2 + (c_{p_y}')^2 + (c_{p_z}')^2$:\n$$\np\\text{-character} = 0^2 + 0^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nAs a check, the sum of a hybrid's character attributes must be $1$: $s\\text{-character} + p\\text{-character} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1$. This is satisfied.\nThe hybrid is an $sp$ hybrid.\nThe required output is the $s$- and $p$-character as a row vector.",
