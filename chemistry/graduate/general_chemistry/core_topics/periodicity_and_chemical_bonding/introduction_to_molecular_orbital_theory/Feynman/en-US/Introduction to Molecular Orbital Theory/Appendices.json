            "problem": "A homonuclear diatomic molecule can be described within the Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO) Molecular Orbital (MO) framework by forming symmetry-adapted combinations of atomic orbitals to produce bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals that extend over both nuclei. For second-row homonuclear diatomics, the $2s$ and $2p$ atomic orbitals produce $\\sigma$ and $\\pi$ sets that carry inversion symmetry labels gerade ($g$) and ungerade ($u$). The bond order is defined as $ \\text{B.O.} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(N_{b} - N_{a}\\right)$, where $N_{b}$ and $N_{a}$ are the numbers of electrons occupying bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals, respectively. Magnetic response is determined by the number of unpaired electrons $n_{u}$: a species with $n_{u} > 0$ is paramagnetic, while a species with $n_{u} = 0$ is diamagnetic.\n\nUsing these fundamental definitions along with the Pauli exclusion principle, the Aufbau principle, and Hund’s rule, analyze the filling of the $2s$- and $2p$-derived molecular orbitals for the homonuclear diatomics $\\text{B}_2$, $\\text{C}_2$, and $\\text{N}_2$.

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard, solvable problem in introductory molecular orbital theory, requiring the application of established principles such as LCAO-MO theory, the Aufbau principle, Hund's rule, and the concept of symmetry-allowed orbital mixing. All necessary definitions and constraints are provided. The problem is valid.\n\nWe begin by establishing the molecular orbital (MO) energy level diagram for second-row homonuclear diatomic molecules. The valence atomic orbitals (AOs) are the $2s$ and $2p$ orbitals. According to the Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO) method, these AOs combine to form MOs of gerade ($g$, symmetric with respect to inversion) and ungerade ($u$, antisymmetric with respect to inversion) symmetry.\n\nThe two $2s$ AOs combine to form a bonding $\\sigma_{g,2s}$ MO and an antibonding $\\sigma_{u,2s}^*$ MO.\nThe six $2p$ AOs (three from each atom) combine to form six MOs. The two $2p_z$ AOs, oriented along the internuclear axis, combine to form a bonding $\\sigma_{g,2p}$ MO and an antibonding $\\sigma_{u,2p}^*$ MO. The four $2p_x$ and $2p_y$ AOs, oriented perpendicular to the axis, combine to form two degenerate bonding $\\pi_{u,2p}$ MOs and two degenerate antibonding $\\pi_{g,2p}^*$ MOs.\n\nA critical aspect for the diatomics up to $\\text{N}_2$ is the phenomenon of $s$-$p$ mixing. MOs of the same symmetry can interact, or \"mix\". In this system, the $\\sigma_g$ MOs derived from the $2s$ and $2p_z$ AOs (namely, $\\sigma_{g,2s}$ and $\\sigma_{g,2p}$) possess the same symmetry. This interaction leads to a stabilization (energy lowering) of the lower-energy $\\sigma_{g,2s}$ MO and a destabilization (energy raising) of the higher-energy $\\sigma_{g,2p}$ MO. The magnitude of this interaction is inversely proportional to the energy difference between the parent $2s$ and $2p$ AOs.\n\nFor elements early in the second period, such as Boron (B), Carbon (C), and Nitrogen (N), the effective nuclear charge is relatively low, and the energy gap between the $2s$ and $2p$ AOs is small. Consequently, $s$-$p$ mixing is substantial. The resulting destabilization of the $\\sigma_{g,2p}$ MO is significant enough to raise its energy above that of the $\\pi_{u,2p}$ MOs, which are unaffected by this mixing as they possess $\\pi_u$ symmetry. Therefore, for $\\text{B}_2$, $\\text{C}_2$, and $\\text{N}_2$, the correct valence MO energy ordering is:\n$$ \\sigma_{g,2s} < \\sigma_{u,2s}^* < \\pi_{u,2p} < \\sigma_{g,2p} < \\pi_{g,2p}^* < \\sigma_{u,2p}^* $$\n\nWe now analyze each molecule by filling this MO diagram with the total number of valence electrons, following the Aufbau principle, the Pauli exclusion principle, and Hund's rule. The bond order ($\\text{B.O.}$) is calculated as $\\frac{1}{2}(N_b - N_a)$, where $N_b$ is the number of electrons in bonding MOs ($\\sigma_{g,2s}$, $\\pi_{u,2p}$, $\\sigma_{g,2p}$) and $N_a$ is the number of electrons in antibonding MOs ($\\sigma_{u,2s}^*$, $\\pi_{g,2p}^*$, $\\sigma_{u,2p}^*$). The number of unpaired electrons is $n_u$.\n\n1.  **Diboron, $\\text{B}_2$**:\n    A Boron atom has the valence electron configuration $2s^2 2p^1$. The $\\text{B}_2$ molecule has a total of $2 \\times (2+1) = 6$ valence electrons.\n    The MO configuration is $(\\sigma_{g,2s})^2 (\\sigma_{u,2s}^*)^2 (\\pi_{u,2p})^2$.\n    According to Hund's rule, the last two electrons occupy the two degenerate $\\pi_{u,2p}$ orbitals singly, with parallel spins.\n    -   Bonding electrons, $N_b = 2 (\\text{in } \\sigma_{g,2s}) + 2 (\\text{in } \\pi_{u,2p}) = 4$.\n    -   Antibonding electrons, $N_a = 2 (\\text{in } \\sigma_{u,2s}^*) = 2$.\n    -   Bond Order, $\\text{B.O.} = \\frac{1}{2}(4-2) = 1$.\n    -   Unpaired electrons, $n_u = 2$. The molecule is paramagnetic. This paramagnetism, confirmed by experiment, is a direct consequence of the MO ordering dictated by strong $s$-$p$ mixing.\n\n2.  **Dicarbon, $\\text{C}_2$**:\n    A Carbon atom has the valence electron configuration $2s^2 2p^2$. The $\\text{C}_2$ molecule has a total of $2 \\times (2+2) = 8$ valence electrons.\n    The MO configuration is $(\\sigma_{g,2s})^2 (\\sigma_{u,2s}^*)^2 (\\pi_{u,2p})^4$.\n    The four electrons completely fill the degenerate $\\pi_{u,2p}$ orbitals.\n    -   Bonding electrons, $N_b = 2 (\\text{in } \\sigma_{g,2s}) + 4 (\\text{in } \\pi_{u,2p}) = 6$.\n    -   Antibonding electrons, $N_a = 2 (\\text{in } \\sigma_{u,2s}^*) = 2$.\n    -   Bond Order, $\\text{B.O.} = \\frac{1}{2}(6-2) = 2$. This is a double bond composed of two $\\pi$ bonds.\n    -   Unpaired electrons, $n_u = 0$. The molecule is diamagnetic.\n\n3.  **Dinitrogen, $\\text{N}_2$**:\n    A Nitrogen atom has the valence electron configuration $2s^2 2p^3$. The $\\text{N}_2$ molecule has a total of $2 \\times (2+3) = 10$ valence electrons.\n    The MO configuration is $(\\sigma_{g,2s})^2 (\\sigma_{u,2s}^*)^2 (\\pi_{u,2p})^4 (\\sigma_{g,2p})^2$.\n    The electrons fill all bonding orbitals derived from the $2s$ and $2p$ AOs.\n    -   Bonding electrons, $N_b = 2 (\\text{in } \\sigma_{g,2s}) + 4 (\\text{in } \\pi_{u,2p}) + 2 (\\text{in } \\sigma_{g,2p}) = 8$.\n    -   Antibonding electrons, $N_a = 2 (\\text{in } \\sigma_{u,2s}^*) = 2$.\n    -   Bond Order, $\\text{B.O.} = \\frac{1}{2}(8-2) = 3$. This is a stable triple bond.\n    -   Unpaired electrons, $n_u = 0$. The molecule is diamagnetic.\n\nThe progression from $\\text{B}_2$ to $\\text{C}_2$ to $\\text{N}_2$ shows a systematic filling of the bonding molecular orbitals, resulting in an increase in bond order from $1$ to $2$ to $3$, respectively. The magnetic properties are determined by whether the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is fully occupied. For $\\text{B}_2$, the HOMO is the degenerate $\\pi_{u,2p}$ set, which is half-filled, leading to paramagnetism. For $\\text{C}_2$ and $\\text{N}_2$, all occupied orbitals are completely filled, resulting in diamagnetism.\n\nThe final results are collated into the requested matrix format.",

            "solution": "The problem statement must first be validated for scientific soundness, self-consistency, and clarity.\n\n**Step 1: Extraction of Givens**\n-   System: A homonuclear diatomic molecule.\n-   Initial State: The molecule is in its electronic ground state.\n-   Electronic Configuration Detail: There is a fully occupied bonding molecular orbital (MO), and an unoccupied antibonding MO of the same symmetry.\n-   Process: An optical excitation promotes exactly $1$ electron from the specified bonding MO to the corresponding antibonding MO. The transition is vertical. Subsequently, the nuclei relax to a new equilibrium geometry in the excited state.\n-   Constraints: Spin–orbit coupling, vibronic mixing, and any change in reduced mass are to be ignored.\n-   Question: Determine (i) the change in bond order, and (ii) the qualitative changes in equilibrium bond length and fundamental vibrational frequency.\n\n**Step 2: Validation and Verdict**\nThe problem describes a standard electronic transition, a fundamental concept in molecular orbital (MO) theory and spectroscopy. The terms used, such as \"bonding MO\", \"antibonding MO\", \"vertical excitation\", \"equilibrium geometry\", \"bond order\", and \"vibrational frequency\", are all well-defined within the context of quantum chemistry and physics. The process of an electron being promoted from a bonding to an antibonding orbital is a common occurrence (e.g., a $\\sigma \\rightarrow \\sigma^*$ or $\\pi \\rightarrow \\pi^*$ transition). The consequences of such a transition on molecular properties like bond length and vibrational frequency are a standard application of MO theory. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains sufficient information to arrive at a definitive answer.\n\n**Verdict: The problem statement is valid.**\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe solution will be derived from the fundamental principles of molecular orbital theory.\n\n(i) **Change in Bond Order**\nThe bond order (BO) is defined as:\n$$ \\text{BO} = \\frac{1}{2} (n_b - n_a) $$\nwhere $n_b$ is the total number of electrons in bonding MOs and $n_a$ is the total number of electrons in antibonding MOs.\n\nIn the ground state, the problem specifies a bonding MO that is \"fully occupied.\" For any given MO, this means it contains $2$ electrons. The corresponding antibonding MO is \"unoccupied,\" meaning it contains $0$ electrons. Let us denote the number of electrons in all *other* bonding and antibonding orbitals as $n_{b, \\text{other}}$ and $n_{a, \\text{other}}$, respectively. These quantities remain constant during the specified transition.\n\nThe configuration of the two relevant orbitals in the initial (ground) state is $(\\psi_{\\text{bonding}})^2 (\\psi_{\\text{antibonding}})^0$.\nThe total number of bonding and antibonding electrons are:\n$$ n_{b, \\text{initial}} = n_{b, \\text{other}} + 2 $$\n$$ n_{a, \\text{initial}} = n_{a, \\text{other}} + 0 $$\nThe initial bond order is:\n$$ \\text{BO}_{\\text{initial}} = \\frac{1}{2} ( (n_{b, \\text{other}} + 2) - (n_{a, \\text{other}} + 0) ) = \\frac{1}{2} (n_{b, \\text{other}} - n_{a, \\text{other}}) + 1 $$\n\nThe excitation promotes $1$ electron from the bonding MO to the antibonding MO. The new configuration of these two orbitals in the final (excited) state is $(\\psi_{\\text{bonding}})^1 (\\psi_{\\text{antibonding}})^1$.\nThe total number of bonding and antibonding electrons are now:\n$$ n_{b, \\text{final}} = n_{b, \\text{other}} + 1 $$\n$$ n_{a, \\text{final}} = n_{a, \\text{other}} + 1 $$\nThe final bond order is:\n$$ \\text{BO}_{\\text{final}} = \\frac{1}{2} ( (n_{b, \\text{other}} + 1) - (n_{a, \\text{other}} + 1) ) = \\frac{1}{2} (n_{b, \\text{other}} - n_{a, \\text{other}}) $$\n\nThe change in bond order, $\\Delta(\\text{BO})$, is:\n$$ \\Delta(\\text{BO}) = \\text{BO}_{\\text{final}} - \\text{BO}_{\\text{initial}} = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} (n_{b, \\text{other}} - n_{a, \\text{other}}) \\right) - \\left( \\frac{1}{2} (n_{b, \\text{other}} - n_{a, \\text{other}}) + 1 \\right) = -1 $$\nThus, the bond order decreases by $1$.\n\n(ii) **Changes in Equilibrium Bond Length and Vibrational Frequency**\nBond order is a direct measure of bond strength. A higher bond order corresponds to a stronger, more stable chemical bond.\n-   **Equilibrium Bond Length ($r_e$)**: A stronger bond pulls the nuclei closer together. Therefore, bond strength is inversely related to equilibrium bond length. Since the bond order decreases by $1$, the bond becomes significantly weaker. A weaker bond results in a greater equilibrium separation between the nuclei. Therefore, the equilibrium bond length increases.\n\n-   **Fundamental Vibrational Frequency ($\\tilde{\\nu}$)**: The vibration of a diatomic molecule can be approximated as a harmonic oscillator. The vibrational frequency, expressed as a wavenumber $\\tilde{\\nu}$, is given by:\n    $$ \\tilde{\\nu} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}} $$\n    where $k$ is the force constant of the bond, $\\mu$ is the reduced mass, and $c$ is the speed of light. The force constant $k$ measures the stiffness of the bond; it is the second derivative of the potential energy with respect to the internuclear distance, evaluated at the equilibrium distance. A stronger bond is stiffer and has a higher force constant.\n    The problem states to ignore any change in reduced mass $\\mu$. Since the bond order decreases, the bond becomes weaker and less stiff. This implies that the force constant $k$ decreases. As $\\tilde{\\nu}$ is proportional to $\\sqrt{k}$, a decrease in $k$ leads to a decrease in the fundamental vibrational frequency.\n\n**Conclusion of Derivation**\nThe electronic excitation causes the bond order to decrease by $1$, which in turn causes the equilibrium bond length to increase and the fundamental vibrational frequency to decrease.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. Bond order decreases by $1$; the equilibrium bond length increases; the vibrational frequency decreases.**\n    This statement perfectly matches all three conclusions derived from first principles.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. Bond order decreases by $1/2$; the equilibrium bond length increases; the vibrational frequency increases.**\n    The change in bond order is calculated to be $-1$, not $-1/2$. Furthermore, the vibrational frequency decreases, it does not increase.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Bond order is unchanged; the equilibrium bond length and vibrational frequency are unchanged because the reduced mass does not change.**\n    The bond order changes; it decreases by $1$. The reasoning that constant reduced mass implies constant bond length and frequency is a non-sequitur; these parameters depend on the electronic potential energy surface, which is altered by the electronic transition.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. Bond order increases by $1$; the equilibrium bond length decreases; the vibrational frequency increases.**\n    The bond order decreases, not increases. The subsequent claims of decreased bond length and increased frequency are consequences of a stronger bond, which is the opposite of what occurs.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

The character for a given symmetry operation $\\hat{R}$ is the trace of the matrix representation of that operation in the given basis. The number of basis functions that are unshifted by an operation contributes to the trace.\n- **$\\hat{E}$**: Both $\\chi_{H_1}$ and $\\chi_{H_2}$ are unshifted. The character is $\\chi(E) = 2$.\n- **$\\hat{C_2}(z)$**: $\\chi_{H_1}$ and $\\chi_{H_2}$ are interchanged. No function remains in its original position. The character is $\\chi(C_2) = 0$.\n- **$\\hat{\\sigma_v}(xz)$**: The molecule lies in this plane, so both hydrogen atoms are unshifted. The character is $\\chi(\\sigma_v) = 2$.\n- **$\\hat{\\sigma_v}'(yz)$**: This plane bisects the $H-O-H$ angle and reflects $H_1$ into $H_2$. No function remains in its original position. The character is $\\chi(\\sigma_v') = 0$.\nTherefore, the characters of the reducible representation are $\\Gamma_{H(1s)} = (2, 0, 2, 0)$.\n\nNext, we decompose this reducible representation into its constituent irreducible representations using the reduction formula:\n$n_i = \\frac{1}{h} \\sum_{\\hat{R}} \\chi_i(\\hat{R}) \\chi_{\\Gamma}(\\hat{R})$, where $h$ is the order of the group, $n_i$ is the number of times the irrep $i$ appears, $\\chi_i$ are the characters of the irrep, and $\\chi_{\\Gamma}$ are the characters of the reducible representation. The order of the $C_{2v}$ group is $h=4$.\n- For $A_{1}$: $n_{A_1} = \\frac{1}{4}[(1)(2) + (1)(0) + (1)(2) + (1)(0)] = \\frac{4}{4} = 1$.\n- For $A_{2}$: $n_{A_2} = \\frac{1}{4}[(1)(2) + (1)(0) + (-1)(2) + (-1)(0)] = \\frac{0}{4} = 0$.\n- For $B_{1}$: $n_{B_1} = \\frac{1}{4}[(1)(2) + (-1)(0) + (1)(2) + (-1)(0)] = \\frac{4}{4} = 1$.\n- For $B_{2}$: $n_{B_2} = \\frac{1}{4}[(1)(2) + (-1)(0) + (-1)(2) + (1)(0)] = \\frac{0}{4} = 0$.\nThus, the reducible representation decomposes as $\\Gamma_{H(1s)} = A_{1} \\oplus B_{1}$. This means there is one SALC of $A_{1}$ symmetry and one of $B_{1}$ symmetry.\n\nWe generate the SALCs using the projection operator, $\\hat{P}^{(i)} = \\frac{l_i}{h} \\sum_{\\hat{R}} \\chi_i(\\hat{R}) \\hat{R}$, where $l_i$ is the dimension of the irrep. For all irreps in $C_{2v}$, $l_i=1$. We apply this operator to one of the basis functions, $\\chi_{H_1}$.\n\nFor the $A_{1}$ SALC:\n$\\psi'_{A_1} \\propto \\hat{P}^{(A_1)}\\chi_{H_1} = (1)\\hat{E}\\chi_{H_1} + (1)\\hat{C_2}\\chi_{H_1} + (1)\\hat{\\sigma_v}\\chi_{H_1} + (1)\\hat{\\sigma_v}'\\chi_{H_1}$\n$\\psi'_{A_1} \\propto (1)\\chi_{H_1} + (1)\\chi_{H_2} + (1)\\chi_{H_1} + (1)\\chi_{H_2} = 2\\chi_{H_1} + 2\\chi_{H_2} \\propto \\chi_{H_1} + \\chi_{H_2}$.\nTo normalize, we require $\\langle\\psi_{A_1}|\\psi_{A_1}\\rangle = 1$. Let $\\psi_{A_1} = N(\\chi_{H_1} + \\chi_{H_2})$. We assume the atomic orbitals form an orthonormal set, i.e., $\\langle\\chi_i|\\chi_j\\rangle = \\delta_{ij}$.\n$\\langle N(\\chi_{H_1} + \\chi_{H_2}) | N(\\chi_{H_1} + \\chi_{H_2}) \\rangle = N^2(\\langle\\chi_{H_1}|\\chi_{H_1}\\rangle + \\langle\\chi_{H_2}|\\chi_{H_2}\\rangle) = N^2(1+1) = 2N^2 = 1$.\nThis gives the normalization constant $N = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\nSo, the normalized $A_{1}$ SALC is $\\psi_{A_1} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\chi_{H_1} + \\chi_{H_2})$.\nThe coefficients for $(\\chi_{H_1}, \\chi_{H_2})$ are $(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})$.\n\nThe problem asks for the second SALC to be antisymmetric under $\\hat{C_2}(z)$. The irreps with character $-1$ for $C_2(z)$ are $B_1$ and $B_2$. Our decomposition $\\Gamma_{H(1s)} = A_1 \\oplus B_1$ dictates that this SALC must belong to the $B_1$ irreducible representation.\n\nFor the $B_{1}$ SALC:\n$\\psi'_{B_1} \\propto \\hat{P}^{(B_1)}\\chi_{H_1} = (1)\\hat{E}\\chi_{H_1} + (-1)\\hat{C_2}\\chi_{H_1} + (1)\\hat{\\sigma_v}\\chi_{H_1} + (-1)\\hat{\\sigma_v}'\\chi_{H_1}$\n$\\psi'_{B_1} \\propto (1)\\chi_{H_1} + (-1)\\chi_{H_2} + (1)\\chi_{H_1} + (-1)\\chi_{H_2} = 2\\chi_{H_1} - 2\\chi_{H_2} \\propto \\chi_{H_1} - \\chi_{H_2}$.\nTo normalize $\\psi_{B_1} = N(\\chi_{H_1} - \\chi_{H_2})$:\n$\\langle N(\\chi_{H_1} - \\chi_{H_2}) | N(\\chi_{H_1} - \\chi_{H_2}) \\rangle = N^2(\\langle\\chi_{H_1}|\\chi_{H_1}\\rangle + \\langle\\chi_{H_2}|\\chi_{H_2}\\rangle) = N^2(1+1) = 2N^2 = 1$.\nThe normalization constant is $N = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\nSo, the normalized $B_{1}$ SALC is $\\psi_{B_1} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\chi_{H_1} - \\chi_{H_2})$.\nThe coefficients for $(\\chi_{H_1}, \\chi_{H_2})$ are $(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}, -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})$.\n\nThe final answer is a row matrix containing the coefficients of the $A_1$ SALC followed by the coefficients of the $B_1$ SALC.\nThe two SALCs are:\n$\\psi_{A_1} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\chi_{H_1} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\chi_{H_2}$\n$\\psi_{B_1} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\chi_{H_1} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\chi_{H_2}$\nThe required matrix of coefficients is constructed from these two vectors.",
