            "introduction": "While formal charges help us evaluate static electron assignments, the actual charge distribution creates bond dipoles. This practice  explores the critical distinction between bond polarity and overall molecular polarity, which depends on the molecule's three-dimensional geometry. Understanding this concept is key to explaining why a molecule with polar bonds, such as beryllium difluoride ($BeF_2$), can be nonpolar, a fact that dictates many of its physical properties.",

            "problem": "A chemistry student is investigating the relationship between bond polarity and molecular polarity. The student is given the following electronegativity values on the Pauling scale: Fluorine ($\\chi_F = 3.98$), Beryllium ($\\chi_{Be} = 1.57$), and Hydrogen ($\\chi_H = 2.20$).\n\nThe student knows from experimental data that a molecule of hydrogen fluoride (HF) is polar, while a molecule of beryllium difluoride (BeF2) is nonpolar. Both molecules contain the highly electronegative fluorine atom, yet their overall molecular polarities are different.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and complete explanation for this observation?\n\nA. Both the H-F and Be-F bonds are polar. However, the BeF2 molecule has a linear geometry, which allows the two Be-F bond dipoles to be oriented in opposite directions and cancel each other out, leading to a zero net dipole moment for the molecule.\n\nB. The beryllium atom in BeF2 forms two bonds, which neutralizes its charge, making the entire molecule nonpolar. The single bond in HF leaves the hydrogen atom with a partial charge, making the molecule polar.\n\nC. The difference in electronegativity for the Be-F bond is smaller than for the H-F bond, making the Be-F bonds effectively nonpolar. Since the bonds themselves are nonpolar, the BeF2 molecule is also nonpolar.\n\nD. Beryllium is a metal and fluorine is a nonmetal, so the bonds in BeF2 are purely ionic. Ionic compounds do not have a molecular dipole moment, whereas the covalent H-F bond allows for one.",
            "solution": "We analyze bond polarity and molecular polarity using electronegativity differences and vector addition of bond dipole moments.\n\n1) Bond polarity arises from an electronegativity difference. For a bond between atoms X and Y, define the electronegativity difference as $\\Delta\\chi_{X-Y} = |\\chi_{X} - \\chi_{Y}|$. If $\\Delta\\chi_{X-Y} > 0$, the bond is polar and has a bond dipole moment vector $\\vec{\\mu}_{\\text{bond}}$ directed from the less electronegative atom toward the more electronegative atom. Symbolically, one may express a bond dipole as $\\vec{\\mu}_{\\text{bond}} = \\delta q\\,\\vec{r}$, where $\\delta q$ is the magnitude of partial charge separation and $\\vec{r}$ is the bond vector from the positive to the negative end.\n\n2) Molecular polarity is determined by the vector sum of all bond dipoles (and any lone-pair contributions if relevant):\n$$\n\\vec{\\mu}_{\\text{molecule}}=\\sum_{i}\\vec{\\mu}_{i}.\n$$\nIf this vector sum is nonzero, the molecule is polar; if it is zero, the molecule is nonpolar.\n\n3) For HF: there is a single H–F bond with $\\Delta\\chi_{\\text{H-F}}>0$, so the bond is polar. Since there is only one bond dipole,\n$$\n\\vec{\\mu}_{\\text{HF}}=\\vec{\\mu}_{\\text{H-F}}\\neq \\vec{0},\n$$\nand HF is polar.\n\n4) For BeF2: each Be–F bond has $\\Delta\\chi_{\\text{Be-F}}>0$, so each bond is polar. Valence-shell electron-pair repulsion reasoning gives a linear geometry for BeF2 (two electron domains around Be and no lone pairs on Be), which places the two identical Be–F bond dipoles $180^{\\circ}$ apart with equal magnitude and opposite directions. Thus,\n$$\n\\vec{\\mu}_{\\text{BeF}_{2}}=\\vec{\\mu}_{1}+\\vec{\\mu}_{2}=\\vec{\\mu}+(-\\vec{\\mu})=\\vec{0},\n$$\nand BeF2 is nonpolar due to cancellation by symmetry.\n\n5) Evaluate the statements:\n- A correctly states that both bonds are polar and that the linear geometry in BeF2 causes exact cancellation of the two equal and opposite bond dipoles, yielding zero net dipole; this matches the vector-sum analysis above.\n- B incorrectly attributes nonpolarity to a vague “neutralization of charge” by forming two bonds; molecular polarity is not determined by the count of bonds but by the vector sum of bond dipoles and geometry.\n- C incorrectly claims the Be–F bonds are effectively nonpolar. A smaller $\\Delta\\chi$ does not make a bond nonpolar unless it is zero; moreover, Be–F bonds are polar. Nonpolarity of BeF2 arises from dipole cancellation, not from nonpolar bonds.\n- D incorrectly characterizes BeF2 bonds as purely ionic and infers absence of a molecular dipole from that. The relevant explanation for the nonpolarity of molecular BeF2 is the linear geometry causing cancellation of polar covalent bond dipoles.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and complete explanation is statement A.",

To operationalize these qualitative criteria for algorithmic classification, we adopt thresholds $\\tau_L = 0.10$ electrons/bohr$^{-5}$ for the magnitude of the Laplacian and $\\tau_\\rho = 0.05$ electrons/bohr$^{-3}$ for low electron density.
