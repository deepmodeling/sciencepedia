            "solution": "The problem statement requires a derivation of the kinetics of an elementary unimolecular decay from first principles, followed by an analysis of its characteristic properties. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard, fundamental exercise in chemical kinetics. The validation is positive.\n\nLet us begin the derivation.\n\nThe system is a closed, isochoric (constant volume, $V$) batch reactor. The concentration of species $A$, denoted $[A]$, is related to the number of molecules of $A$, $N_A$, by the definition of molar concentration:\n$$[A] = \\frac{N_A}{N_{Av} V}$$\nwhere $N_{Av}$ is Avogadro's constant. Since $N_{Av}$ and $V$ are constants, the time evolution of the concentration is directly proportional to the time evolution of the number of molecules:\n$$\\frac{d[A]}{dt} = \\frac{1}{N_{Av} V} \\frac{dN_A}{dt}$$\n\nThe problem states that each molecule of $A$ has a constant probability per unit time, $k$, to decay. Over an infinitesimal time interval $dt$, the probability that a single, specific molecule will decay is $k \\cdot dt$. As the molecules are assumed to behave independently, the total number of decay events expected to occur in the interval $dt$ is the product of the number of molecules present, $N_A$, and the probability of decay for any one molecule.\n\nThe change in the number of molecules of $A$, $dN_A$, over the interval $dt$ is therefore given by the negative of the expected number of decays:\n$$dN_A = - (N_A) \\times (k \\cdot dt)$$\nRearranging this expression gives the differential equation for the number of molecules:\n$$\\frac{dN_A}{dt} = -k N_A$$\n\nTo express this in terms of concentration, we substitute $N_A = [A] N_{Av} V$ into the differential equation:\n$$\\frac{d([A] N_{Av} V)}{dt} = -k ([A] N_{Av} V)$$\nSince $N_{Av}$ and $V$ are constants, we can factor them out of the derivative on the left-hand side and cancel them from both sides of the equation:\n$$N_{Av} V \\frac{d[A]}{dt} = -k N_{Av} V [A]$$\n$$\\frac{d[A]}{dt} = -k [A]$$\nThis is the differential rate law for an elementary unimolecular reaction, also known as a first-order reaction. The microscopic hazard parameter $k$ is identical to the macroscopic first-order rate constant.\n\nTo find the time evolution of $[A](t)$, we must solve this first-order ordinary differential equation subject to the initial condition $[A](0) = [A]_0$. We proceed by separation of variables:\n$$\\frac{d[A]}{[A]} = -k dt$$\nWe integrate both sides from the initial state (time $t=0$, concentration $[A]_0$) to an arbitrary state (time $t$, concentration $[A](t)$). We use dummy variables $t'$ and $[A]'$ for integration to avoid confusion.\n$$\\int_{[A]_0}^{[A](t)} \\frac{1}{[A]'} d[A]' = \\int_0^t -k dt'$$\nThe integration yields:\n$$[\\ln([A]')]_{[A]_0}^{[A](t)} = [-kt']_0^t$$\n$$\\ln([A](t)) - \\ln([A]_0) = -kt - (-k \\cdot 0)$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{[A](t)}{[A]_0}\\right) = -kt$$\nTo obtain the explicit expression for $[A](t)$, we exponentiate both sides:\n$$\\frac{[A](t)}{[A]_0} = \\exp(-kt)$$\n$$[A](t) = [A]_0 \\exp(-kt)$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we must propose an experimental data transformation that yields a straight line. Examination of the intermediate equation from our derivation provides the answer:\n$$\\ln([A](t)) = -kt + \\ln([A]_0)$$\nThis equation is in the form of a straight line, $y = mx + c$, where:\n- The dependent variable is $y = \\ln([A](t))$.\n- The independent variable is $x = t$.\n- The slope is $m = -k$.\n- The y-intercept is $c = \\ln([A]_0)$.\n\nTherefore, a plot of the natural logarithm of the concentration of $A$, $\\ln([A])$, versus time, $t$, will produce a straight line for a process that obeys this model. Deviations from linearity in such a plot would indicate that the underlying assumption—that the rate of decay is directly proportional to the concentration, $\\text{rate} = k[A]$—is incorrect. This could be due to a more complex reaction mechanism, a reaction order other than one, or violation of the assumption that $k$ is constant.\n\nNext, we derive the half-life, $t_{1/2}$, defined by the condition $[A](t_{1/2}) = [A]_0/2$. We substitute this condition into the integrated rate law:\n$$\\frac{[A]_0}{2} = [A]_0 \\exp(-k t_{1/2})$$\nAssuming $[A]_0 \\neq 0$, we can divide by $[A]_0$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} = \\exp(-k t_{1/2})$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = -k t_{1/2}$$\nUsing the property $\\ln(1/x) = -\\ln(x)$, we have:\n$$-\\ln(2) = -k t_{1/2}$$\nSolving for the half-life $t_{1/2}$:\n$$t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k}$$\nThis expression for $t_{1/2}$ depends only on the rate constant $k$. It does not contain the initial concentration $[A]_0$. Thus, for an elementary unimolecular decay, the half-life is independent of the initial concentration.\n\nFor the third part, we are asked to compute the diagnostic ratio $R \\equiv t_{1/2}^{(1)}/t_{1/2}^{(2)}$ for two experiments where initial concentrations $[A]_0^{(1)} \\neq [A]_0^{(2)}$, but all other conditions are identical. The condition that the experiments are \"otherwise identical\" implies that the temperature is the same, and thus the microscopic hazard parameter (rate constant) $k$ is the same for both experiments.\n\nUsing the half-life formula derived above for each experiment:\n- For experiment 1: $t_{1/2}^{(1)} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k}$\n- For experiment 2: $t_{1/2}^{(2)} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k}$\n\nSince the half-life is independent of the initial concentration for this reaction order, $t_{1/2}^{(1)}$ is equal to $t_{1/2}^{(2)}$. The ratio $R$ is therefore:\n$$R = \\frac{t_{1/2}^{(1)}}{t_{1/2}^{(2)}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\ln(2)}{k}}{\\frac{\\ln(2)}{k}} = 1$$\nThe value of the diagnostic ratio is $1$. This result is a defining characteristic of first-order kinetics.",
