It is well-posed, as all necessary data and constants are provided for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem is free of factual unsoundness, non-formalizable concepts, incompleteness, contradictions, or any other listed flaw.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe nuclear binding energy, $B$, of a nucleus $^A_Z X$ is defined as the energy required to disassemble the nucleus into its $Z$ constituent protons and $N$ constituent neutrons, where $A = Z+N$ is the mass number. According to the mass–energy equivalence principle, this energy corresponds to the mass defect, $\\Delta m$.\nThe mass defect is the difference between the sum of the masses of the individual free nucleons and the mass of the bound nucleus, $m_{nuc}(^A_Z X)$. Let $m_p$ be the proton mass and $m_n$ be the neutron mass.\n$$ \\Delta m = Z m_p + N m_n - m_{nuc}(^A_Z X) $$\nThe binding energy is therefore:\n$$ B = (\\Delta m) c^2 = (Z m_p + N m_n - m_{nuc}(^A_Z X))c^2 $$\nExperimental data typically provide atomic masses, $m(^A_Z X)$, not nuclear masses. The atomic mass includes the mass of the nucleus, the mass of the $Z$ electrons ($m_e$), and accounts for the total electronic binding energy, $B_e$.\n$$ m(^A_Z X) = m_{nuc}(^A_Z X) + Z m_e - \\frac{B_e(^A_Z X)}{c^2} $$\nFrom this, the nuclear mass can be expressed as:\n$$ m_{nuc}(^A_Z X) = m(^A_Z X) - Z m_e + \\frac{B_e(^A_Z X)}{c^2} $$\nSubstituting this expression into the equation for binding energy:\n$$ B = \\left(Z m_p + N m_n - \\left[m(^A_Z X) - Z m_e + \\frac{B_e(^A_Z X)}{c^2}\\right]\\right) c^2 $$\n$$ B = (Z m_p + Z m_e + N m_n - m(^A_Z X) - \\frac{B_e(^A_Z X)}{c^2}) c^2 $$\nTo handle the proton mass $m_p$, we use the provided mass of the hydrogen atom, $m(^1\\mathrm{H})$. The mass of a hydrogen atom is the sum of the proton mass and electron mass, corrected for the electronic binding energy of hydrogen ($13.6~\\mathrm{eV}$):\n$$ m(^1\\mathrm{H}) = m_p + m_e - \\frac{B_e(^1\\mathrm{H})}{c^2} $$\nWe can express the term $(m_p + m_e)$ as:\n$$ m_p + m_e = m(^1\\mathrm{H}) + \\frac{B_e(^1\\mathrm{H})}{c^2} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $B$:\n$$ B = \\left(Z \\left[m(^1\\mathrm{H}) + \\frac{B_e(^1\\mathrm{H})}{c^2}\\right] + N m_n - m(^A_Z X) - \\frac{B_e(^A_Z X)}{c^2}\\right) c^2 $$\n$$ B = \\left(Z m(^1\\mathrm{H}) + N m_n - m(^A_Z X)\\right)c^2 + Z B_e(^1\\mathrm{H}) - B_e(^A_Z X) $$\nThe problem states that electronic binding energies are negligible. This is a sound approximation. Nuclear binding energies are of the order of megaelectronvolts (MeV), whereas total electronic binding energies are of the order of kiloelectronvolts (keV) at most (e.g., for Uranium, $B_e \\approx 115~\\mathrm{keV}$). The term $Z B_e(^1\\mathrm{H}) - B_e(^A_Z X)$ is thus many orders of magnitude smaller than the nuclear binding energy and can be neglected. This yields the final working equation for binding energy using atomic masses:\n$$ B \\approx \\left[Z m(^1\\mathrm{H}) + N m_n - m(^A_Z X)\\right] c^2 $$\nThe binding energy per nucleon is then $\\frac{B}{A}$.\n\nWe now compute this for $^{56}\\mathrm{Fe}$ and $^{238}\\mathrm{U}$.\nLet the conversion factor be $C = 931.49410242~\\frac{\\mathrm{MeV}}{\\mathrm{u}}$.\n\nFor $^{56}\\mathrm{Fe}$ ($Z=26, N=30, A=56$):\nThe mass defect, $\\Delta m_{Fe}$, is:\n$$ \\Delta m_{Fe} = 26 \\cdot m(^1\\mathrm{H}) + 30 \\cdot m_n - m(^{56}\\mathrm{Fe}) $$\n$$ \\Delta m_{Fe} = 26 \\cdot (1.00782503223~\\mathrm{u}) + 30 \\cdot (1.00866491588~\\mathrm{u}) - 55.93493633~\\mathrm{u} $$\n$$ \\Delta m_{Fe} = 26.20345083798~\\mathrm{u} + 30.2599474764~\\mathrm{u} - 55.93493633~\\mathrm{u} $$\n$$ \\Delta m_{Fe} = 56.46339831438~\\mathrm{u} - 55.93493633~\\mathrm{u} = 0.52846198438~\\mathrm{u} $$\nThe binding energy per nucleon for $^{56}\\mathrm{Fe}$ is:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{B}{A}\\right)_{^{56}\\mathrm{Fe}} = \\frac{\\Delta m_{Fe} \\cdot C}{A_{Fe}} = \\frac{0.52846198438~\\mathrm{u} \\cdot 931.49410242~\\frac{\\mathrm{MeV}}{\\mathrm{u}}}{56} \\approx 8.790366~\\frac{\\mathrm{MeV}}{\\mathrm{nucleon}} $$\n\nFor $^{238}\\mathrm{U}$ ($Z=92, N=146, A=238$):\nThe mass defect, $\\Delta m_{U}$, is:\n$$ \\Delta m_{U} = 92 \\cdot m(^1\\mathrm{H}) + 146 \\cdot m_n - m(^{238}\\mathrm{U}) $$\n$$ \\Delta m_{U} = 92 \\cdot (1.00782503223~\\mathrm{u}) + 146 \\cdot (1.00866491588~\\mathrm{u}) - 238.05078826~\\mathrm{u} $$\n$$ \\Delta m_{U} = 92.71990296516~\\mathrm{u} + 147.26507771848~\\mathrm{u} - 238.05078826~\\mathrm{u} $$\n$$ \\Delta m_{U} = 239.98498068364~\\mathrm{u} - 238.05078826~\\mathrm{u} = 1.93419242364~\\mathrm{u} $$\nThe binding energy per nucleon for $^{238}\\mathrm{U}$ is:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{B}{A}\\right)_{^{238}\\mathrm{U}} = \\frac{\\Delta m_{U} \\cdot C}{A_{U}} = \\frac{1.93419242364~\\mathrm{u} \\cdot 931.49410242~\\frac{\\mathrm{MeV}}{\\mathrm{u}}}{238} \\approx 7.570227~\\frac{\\mathrm{MeV}}{\\mathrm{nucleon}} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the difference $\\Delta$:\n$$ \\Delta = \\left(\\frac{B}{A}\\right)_{^{56}\\mathrm{Fe}} - \\left(\\frac{B}{A}\\right)_{^{238}\\mathrm{U}} $$\n$$ \\Delta \\approx 8.790366~\\frac{\\mathrm{MeV}}{\\mathrm{nucleon}} - 7.570227~\\frac{\\mathrm{MeV}}{\\mathrm{nucleon}} \\approx 1.220139~\\frac{\\mathrm{MeV}}{\\mathrm{nucleon}} $$\nThe positive value of $\\Delta$ indicates that nucleons in $^{56}\\mathrm{Fe}$ are, on average, more tightly bound than nucleons in $^{238}\\mathrm{U}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of the stability of isobars with mass number $A=94$ using the semi-empirical mass formula (SEMF). The most stable isobar for a given $A$ is the one with the maximum binding energy $B(A,Z)$, or equivalently, the minimum mass.

The even-even nucleus is predicted to be the most stable.\n\nThe physical reason is that the binding energy gain from pairing for the even-even nucleus ($0.796\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$) is larger than the penalty it pays for being further from the continuous optimum $Z_0$ relative to its odd-odd neighbor ($0.31\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$).\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\n\nA) Even-even, because the pairing gain outweighs the Coulomb and asymmetry penalties incurred by moving to the nearest even $Z$ from the continuous optimum.\nThis option correctly identifies the most stable parity class as even-even.

Our calculation shows $0.796\\,\\mathrm{MeV} > 0.31\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$, which confirms this reasoning. This statement is quantitatively and conceptually correct. **Correct**.\n\nB) Odd-odd, because it can sit closer to the asymmetry minimum in $Z$ at fixed $A$, and the associated Coulomb plus asymmetry advantage exceeds the pairing disadvantage.\nThis option incorrectly predicts the odd-odd nucleus as most stable.

The inequality $0.31\\,\\mathrm{MeV} > 0.796\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$ is false. **Incorrect**.\n\nC) Odd-even, because the pairing term vanishes and thus it benefits from being closest to the continuous optimum.\nThis option is fundamentally flawed.

An atomic mass, $M(^A_Z X)$, is related to the nuclear mass, $m_{\\text{nuc}}(^A_Z X)$, by the following expression, where $Z$ is the atomic number, $m_e$ is the electron mass, and $B_e(Z)$ is the total binding energy of the $Z$ electrons in the atom:\n$$\nM(^A_Z X) = m_{\\text{nuc}}(^A_Z X) + Z m_e - \\frac{B_e(Z)}{c^2}\n$$\nRearranging for nuclear mass: $m_{\\text{nuc}}(^A_Z X) = M(^A_Z X) - Z m_e + \\frac{B_e(Z)}{c^2}$.\nSubstituting this into the equation for $Q_{\\alpha}$:\n$$\nQ_{\\alpha} = \\left[ \\left(M(^{238}\\mathrm{U}) - 92m_e + \\frac{B_e(92)}{c^2}\\right) - \\left(M(^{234}\\mathrm{Th}) - 90m_e + \\frac{B_e(90)}{c^2}\\right) - \\left(M(^{4}\\mathrm{He}) - 2m_e + \\frac{B_e(2)}{c^2}\\right) \\right] c^2\n$$\nCollecting the terms involving electron mass $m_e$:\n$$\n(-92 - (-90) - (-2))m_e = (-92 + 90 + 2)m_e = 0 \\cdot m_e = 0\n$$\nThe electron masses cancel exactly. The equation for $Q_{\\alpha}$ simplifies to:\n$$\nQ_{\\alpha} = \\left[ M(^{238}\\mathrm{U}) - M(^{234}\\mathrm{Th}) - M(^{4}\\mathrm{He}) \\right] c^2 + \\left[ B_e(92) - B_e(90) - B_e(2) \\right]\n$$\nThe term involving the difference in electron binding energies is on the order of kiloelectronvolts ($\\mathrm{keV}$), whereas the nuclear energy release $Q_{\\alpha}$ is on the order of megaelectronvolts ($\\mathrm{MeV}$). This binding energy difference is negligible (less than $0.01\\%$) compared to the total energy release. Therefore, it is a valid and highly accurate approximation to calculate the $Q$-value using the difference in atomic masses.\nLet $\\Delta M$ be the mass difference based on the provided atomic masses:\n$$\n\\Delta M = M(^{238}\\mathrm{U}) - M(^{234}\\mathrm{Th}) - M(^{4}\\mathrm{He})\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta M = 238.05078826\\,\\mathrm{u} - 234.043601\\,\\mathrm{u} - 4.002603254\\,\\mathrm{u}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta M = 238.05078826\\,\\mathrm{u} - 238.046204254\\,\\mathrm{u} = 0.004584006\\,\\mathrm{u}\n$$\nThe decay energy $Q_{\\alpha}$ is then calculated using the given conversion factor:\n$$\nQ_{\\alpha} = \\Delta M c^2 = (0.004584006\\,\\mathrm{u}) \\times (931.49410242\\,\\mathrm{MeV}/c^2) \\times c^2 \\approx 4.269750\\,\\mathrm{MeV}\n$$\nThis released energy is partitioned as kinetic energy between the daughter nucleus ($^{234}\\mathrm{Th}$) and the $\\alpha$ particle ($^{4}\\mathrm{He}$). Since the parent nucleus is initially stationary, the total initial momentum is zero. By the principle of conservation of linear momentum, the total final momentum must also be zero.\n$$\n\\vec{p}_{\\mathrm{Th}} + \\vec{p}_{\\alpha} = \\vec{0} \\implies \\vec{p}_{\\mathrm{Th}} = -\\vec{p}_{\\alpha}\n$$\nThis implies that the magnitudes of their momenta are equal: $p_{\\mathrm{Th}} = p_{\\alpha} = p$.\nThe total kinetic energy is the sum of the kinetic energies of the products, which must equal the decay energy $Q_{\\alpha}$:\n$$\nQ_{\\alpha} = K_{\\mathrm{Th}} + K_{\\alpha}\n$$\nUsing the nonrelativistic formula for kinetic energy, $K = \\frac{p^2}{2m}$, we have:\n$$\nK_{\\mathrm{Th}} = \\frac{p^2}{2 M_{\\mathrm{Th}}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad K_{\\alpha} = \\frac{p^2}{2 M_{\\alpha}}\n$$\nwhere $M_{\\mathrm{Th}}$ and $M_{\\alpha}$ are the masses of the thorium and helium atoms, respectively. From these relations, we can express the momentum squared as $p^2 = 2 K_{\\mathrm{Th}} M_{\\mathrm{Th}} = 2 K_{\\alpha} M_{\\alpha}$. This allows us to relate the two kinetic energies:\n$$\nK_{\\mathrm{Th}} = K_{\\alpha} \\frac{M_{\\alpha}}{M_{\\mathrm{Th}}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the energy conservation equation:\n$$\nQ_{\\alpha} = K_{\\alpha} \\frac{M_{\\alpha}}{M_{\\mathrm{Th}}} + K_{\\alpha} = K_{\\alpha} \\left(1 + \\frac{M_{\\alpha}}{M_{\\mathrm{Th}}}\\right) = K_{\\alpha} \\left(\\frac{M_{\\mathrm{Th}} + M_{\\alpha}}{M_{\\mathrm{Th}}}\\right)\n$$\nSolving for the kinetic energy of the $\\alpha$ particle, $K_{\\alpha}$:\n$$\nK_{\\alpha} = Q_{\\alpha} \\left(\\frac{M_{\\mathrm{Th}}}{M_{\\mathrm{Th}} + M_{\\alpha}}\\right)\n$$\nThis important result shows that the lighter particle (the $\\alpha$ particle) carries away the majority of the kinetic energy. Using the provided masses:\n$$\nM_{\\mathrm{Th}} = 234.043601\\,\\mathrm{u}\n$$\n$$\nM_{\\alpha} = 4.002603254\\,\\mathrm{u}\n$$\n$$\nM_{\\mathrm{Th}} + M_{\\alpha} = 234.043601\\,\\mathrm{u} + 4.002603254\\,\\mathrm{u} = 238.046204254\\,\\mathrm{u}\n$$\nNow, substituting the values into the expression for $K_{\\alpha}$:\n$$\nK_{\\alpha} = (4.269750\\,\\mathrm{MeV}) \\left(\\frac{234.043601}{238.046204254}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nK_{\\alpha} \\approx (4.269750\\,\\mathrm{MeV}) \\times (0.9831856) \\approx 4.19813\\,\\mathrm{MeV}\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as required by the problem statement gives:\n$$\nK_{\\alpha} \\approx 4.198\\,\\mathrm{MeV}\n$$\nThe nonrelativistic assumption is justified, as the kinetic energy of the $\\alpha$ particle ($4.198\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$) is much smaller than its rest mass energy ($M_{\\alpha}c^2 \\approx 4.003\\,\\mathrm{u} \\times 931.5\\,\\mathrm{MeV/u} \\approx 3728\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$).",
