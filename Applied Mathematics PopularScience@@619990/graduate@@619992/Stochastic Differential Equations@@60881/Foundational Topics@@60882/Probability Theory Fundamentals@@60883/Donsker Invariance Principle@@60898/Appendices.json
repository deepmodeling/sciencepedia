It is a non-trivial problem that tests a fundamental concept in the transition from central limit theorems to functional central limit theorems, specifically the different scaling behaviors of the mean and the standard deviation.\n7.  It is mathematically verifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation\nThe process is defined as $X_n(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} S_{\\lfloor n t \\rfloor} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\lfloor n t \\rfloor} Y_k$. The random variables $\\{Y_k\\}$ are i.i.d. with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2$.\n\nFirst, let us compute the expected value of the process $X_n(t)$. By the linearity of expectation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X_n(t)] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\lfloor n t \\rfloor} Y_k\\right] = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\lfloor n t \\rfloor} \\mathbb{E}[Y_k]\n$$\nSince $\\mathbb{E}[Y_k] = \\mu$ for all $k \\geq 1$, we have:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X_n(t)] = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\lfloor n t \\rfloor} \\mu = \\frac{\\lfloor n t \\rfloor}{\\sqrt{n}} \\mu\n$$\nFor large $n$, we have the approximation $\\lfloor n t \\rfloor \\approx n t$. Therefore, the asymptotic behavior of the expectation is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X_n(t)] \\approx \\frac{n t}{\\sqrt{n}} \\mu = \\sqrt{n} \\, t \\, \\mu\n$$\nSince $\\mu \\neq 0$, for any $t > 0$, the expected value $\\mathbb{E}[X_n(t)]$ diverges to $\\pm\\infty$ as $n \\to \\infty$. A sequence of random processes that converges in distribution must be tight. The diverging mean implies that the sequence $\\{X_n\\}$ is not tight, as the probability mass of the process \"escapes to infinity.\" Consequently, the process $X_n(t)$ as defined does not converge in distribution to any proper limiting process, let alone a Brownian motion.\n\nDonsker's invariance principle applies to sums of random variables with zero mean. To apply it here, we must center the increments. Let us define a new set of i.i.d. random variables $Y'_k = Y_k - \\mu$. These new variables have:\n- Mean: $\\mathbb{E}[Y'_k] = \\mathbb{E}[Y_k - \\mu] = \\mathbb{E}[Y_k] - \\mu = \\mu - \\mu = 0$.\n- Variance: $\\mathrm{Var}(Y'_k) = \\mathrm{Var}(Y_k - \\mu) = \\mathrm{Var}(Y_k) = \\sigma^2$.\n\nNow, let us construct the corresponding centered process, $X'_n(t)$:\n$$\nX'_n(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\lfloor n t \\rfloor} Y'_k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\lfloor n t \\rfloor} (Y_k - \\mu)\n$$\nBy Donsker's invariance principle (since $\\mathbb{E}[Y'_k] = 0$ and $\\mathrm{Var}(Y'_k) = \\sigma^2 < \\infty$), the process $X'_n(t)$ converges in distribution in the Skorokhod space $D([0,1])$ to a Brownian motion $B(t)$ with mean $0$ and variance $\\mathrm{Var}(B(t)) = t \\cdot \\mathrm{Var}(Y'_1) = \\sigma^2 t$. This limiting process is commonly denoted as $\\sigma W(t)$, where $W(t)$ is a standard Brownian motion (with variance $t$).\n\nWe can express the centered process $X'_n(t)$ in terms of the original process $X_n(t)$:\n$$\nX'_n(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^{\\lfloor n t \\rfloor} Y_k - \\sum_{k=1}^{\\lfloor n t \\rfloor} \\mu \\right) = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\lfloor n t \\rfloor} Y_k \\right) - \\frac{\\lfloor n t \\rfloor}{\\sqrt{n}} \\mu\n$$\n$$\nX'_n(t) = X_n(t) - \\frac{\\lfloor n t \\rfloor}{\\sqrt{n}} \\mu\n$$\nThis shows that the correct centering procedure for the process $X_n(t)$ is to subtract its mean, $\\mathbb{E}[X_n(t)] = \\frac{\\lfloor n t \\rfloor}{\\sqrt{n}} \\mu$. The centered process $X_n(t) - \\mathbb{E}[X_n(t)]$ converges to a driftless Brownian motion $\\sigma W(t)$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $\\mathbb{E}[X_n(t)] = \\mu t$ for all $n$, so $X_n$ converges to a Brownian motion with deterministic drift $\\mu t$ and diffusion coefficient $\\sigma^2$; to remove the drift, subtract $\\mu t$ from $X_n(t)$.**\nThe calculation of the expectation is incorrect. As shown above, $\\mathbb{E}[X_n(t)] = \\mu \\frac{\\lfloor n t \\rfloor}{\\sqrt{n}}$, not $\\mu t$. The mean grows with $\\sqrt{n}$, so the process $X_n$ does not converge. The proposed centering is also incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. $\\mathbb{E}[X_n(t)] = \\mu \\frac{\\lfloor n t \\rfloor}{\\sqrt{n}} \\approx \\mu \\sqrt{n}\\, t$, so the sequence $\\{X_n\\}$ is not tight around $0$ due to a growing deterministic linear trend. To obtain a driftless Brownian limit, center by replacing each increment $Y_k$ with $Y_k - \\mu$, equivalently subtract $\\mu \\frac{\\lfloor n t \\rfloor}{\\sqrt{n}}$ from $X_n(t)$; the centered sequence converges to $\\sigma W(t)$, where $W(t)$ is standard Brownian motion.**\nThis statement correctly identifies the expectation of $X_n(t)$ and its asymptotic behavior. It correctly concludes that this growing trend prevents tightness and convergence. It correctly describes the two equivalent methods for centering: either at the level of the increments ($Y_k - \\mu$) or at the level of the scaled process ($X_n(t) - \\mathbb{E}[X_n(t)]$). Finally, it correctly identifies the limit of the centered process as $\\sigma W(t)$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. The nonzero mean is washed out by the scaling $n^{-1/2}$, so $\\mathbb{E}[X_n(t)] \\to 0$ as $n \\to \\infty$; no centering is required, and Donsker’s invariance principle yields the limit $\\sigma W(t)$.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. The scaling $n^{-1/2}$ is applied to a sum of $\\approx nt$ terms. The mean of the sum grows as $nt\\mu$, so after scaling, the mean of the process grows as $\\frac{nt\\mu}{\\sqrt{n}} = \\sqrt{n}t\\mu$. This does not go to $0$. Centering is essential.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The correct centering must subtract $\\mu n t$ from $X_n(t)$ because the drift scales linearly in $n$; after such centering the limit is a driftless Brownian motion.**\nThe drift of $X_n(t)$ does not scale linearly in $n$; it scales with $\\sqrt{n}$. The term $\\mu n t$ is the approximate mean of the *unscaled* sum $S_{\\lfloor n t \\rfloor}$. Subtracting $\\mu n t$ from $X_n(t)$ is an incorrect centering.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. With $\\mu \\neq 0$ the only possible limit after any centering is a Brownian motion with drift $\\mu t$; it is impossible to obtain a driftless Brownian limit by any centering.**\nThis statement is false. As demonstrated in the analysis for option B, a driftless Brownian motion is precisely the limit one obtains after correct centering. The purpose of centering is to remove the deterministic trend entirely, isolating the stochastic fluctuations which converge to a driftless Brownian motion under diffusive scaling.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2973373"}, {"introduction": "While the theory is often introduced with independent increments, its true power shines when applied to systems with memory, such as stationary time series.

The Functional Central Limit Theorem (FCLT), also known as Donsker's invariance principle, describes the limiting behavior of the scaled partial-sum process $S_{n}(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\sum_{k=1}^{\\lfloor nt\\rfloor}\\xi_{k}$.\n\nThe process $\\{\\xi_k\\}$ is a strictly stationary and causal ARMA(1,1) process. The conditions $|\\phi|<1$ and $\\mathbb{E}[|\\varepsilon_{k}|^{2+\\delta}]<\\infty$ ensure that the process is ergodic and has strong mixing properties, with an absolutely summable autocovariance function ($\\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty}|\\gamma_k|<\\infty$) as stated in the problem. These are standard sufficient conditions for the FCLT to hold for a stationary time series.\n\nThe theorem states that as $n \\to \\infty$, the process $S_n(t)$ converges in distribution on the space of càdlàg functions $D[0,1]$ to a scaled Brownian motion, which we denote by $X(t)$:\n$$\nS_{n}(t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\sum_{k=1}^{\\lfloor nt\\rfloor}\\xi_{k} \\xrightarrow{d} X(t) = \\sigma W(t)\n$$\nwhere $W(t)$ is a standard Wiener process (Brownian motion), and $\\sigma^2$ is the long-run variance of the process $\\{\\xi_k\\}$. This long-run variance is defined as the limiting variance of the scaled sum:\n$$\n\\sigma^2 = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\operatorname{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\xi_{k}\\right) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\operatorname{Cov}(\\xi_i, \\xi_j)\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma^2 = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{k=-(n-1)}^{n-1} \\left(1-\\frac{|k|}{n}\\right)\\gamma_{k} = \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\gamma_k = \\gamma_0 + 2\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\gamma_k\n$$\nThe last equality holds due to the absolute summability of $\\gamma_k$. This confirms that the parameter $\\sigma^2$ governing the limiting distribution is precisely the long-run variance we calculated.\n\nThe limiting process $X(t) = \\sigma W(t)$ is characterized by its stochastic differential equation (SDE). A standard Wiener process $W(t)$ is a solution to $dW_t = dW_t$ with $W_0=0$. For $X(t) = \\sigma W(t)$, the corresponding SDE is obtained by a simple scaling:\n$$\ndX(t) = d(\\sigma W(t)) = \\sigma dW(t)\n$$\nwith the initial condition $X(0)=0$. In this SDE, the parameter $\\sigma$ is known as the diffusion coefficient, which determines the volatility or scale of the random fluctuations.

In addition, for subordinated Gaussian sequences $X_k = g(Y_k)$ with $\\{Y_k\\}$ Gaussian and long-range dependent, the Hermite rank $m$ of $g$ governs the limiting non-Gaussian behavior.\n\nSelect all statements that correctly describe failure modes of Donsker’s invariance principle when mixing is too weak (for example due to long-range dependence), together with their implications for stochastic differential equations driven by scaling limits of $S_n(\\cdot)$.\n\nA.

Even in the long-range dependence regime, the limiting continuous-time process is a semimartingale, hence classical Itô stochastic differential equations driven by this limit remain well-posed without modification.\n\nChoose the correct options.", "solution": "The problem requires an evaluation of several statements concerning the failure of Donsker's invariance principle, particularly in the context of stationary sequences with weak mixing properties, such as those exhibiting long-range dependence (LRD). The task is to identify all correct statements that describe these failure modes and their consequences.\n\nFirst, let's establish the baseline. Donsker's principle, a functional central limit theorem (FCLT), states that for a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables $\\{X_k\\}$ with $\\mathbb{E}[X_k]=0$ and $\\mathbb{E}[X_k^2]=\\sigma^2 < \\infty$, the scaled partial-sum process $W_n(t) = n^{-1/2} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\lfloor nt \\rfloor} X_k$ converges in distribution in the Skorokhod space $D([0,1])$ to $\\sigma W(t)$, where $W(t)$ is a standard Brownian motion. This result extends to dependent sequences, provided the dependence decays sufficiently quickly (e.g., strong mixing with summable mixing coefficients, or short-range dependence where autocovariances are absolutely summable). Long-range dependence (LRD) represents a case where this decay is too slow, leading to a breakdown of the classical FCLT.\n\nLet the partial sum be $S_n = \\sum_{k=1}^n X_k$. The variance of the partial sum is given by\n$$ \\operatorname{Var}(S_n) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^n \\operatorname{Cov}(X_i, X_j) = n \\operatorname{Var}(X_0) + 2 \\sum_{h=1}^{n-1} (n-h) \\operatorname{Cov}(X_0, X_h) = n\\sigma^2 + 2\\sum_{h=1}^{n-1}(n-h)r(h). $$\nFor LRD, characterized by $r(h) \\sim c h^{-(1-2H)}$ for $H \\in (1/2, 1)$, the sum $\\sum_h |r(h)|$ diverges. The variance behaves as $\\operatorname{Var}(S_n) \\sim C_H n^{2H}$ for a constant $C_H > 0$ as $n \\to \\infty$. This implies that the standard normalization $n^{-1/2}$ is inappropriate, as $\\operatorname{Var}(n^{-1/2} S_n) \\sim C_H n^{2H-1} \\to \\infty$ since $H > 1/2$. The correct normalization is $n^{-H}$.\n\nNow, we will evaluate each option based on these principles.\n\n**A. If $\\{X_k\\}$ is strongly mixing with coefficients $\\alpha(n)$ satisfying $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\alpha(n)^{\\delta/(2+\\delta)} < \\infty$ for some $\\delta > 0$ and $\\mathbb{E}[|X_0|^{2+\\delta}] < \\infty$, then $n^{-1/2} S_n(\\cdot) \\Rightarrow W(\\cdot)$ in $D([0,1])$, so weak mixing does not alter the Brownian limit.**\n\nThis statement describes a well-known sufficient condition for the FCLT to hold for a strongly mixing sequence (see, e.g., Ibragimov & Linnik, 1971; Herrndorf, 1984). The condition $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\alpha(n)^{\\delta/(2+\\delta)} < \\infty$ ensures that the dependence structure is weak enough for the partial sums to behave asymptotically like those in the i.i.d. case. Specifically, it guarantees that the long-run variance $\\sigma_{long}^2 = \\sigma^2 + 2\\sum_{h=1}^\\infty r(h)$ is finite and positive, and the scaled process $n^{-1/2}S_n(\\cdot)$ converges to $\\sigma_{long}W(\\cdot)$. The problem statement simplifies this to $W(\\cdot)$, which we interpret as a generic Brownian motion, possibly with a different variance from the marginal variance $\\sigma^2$. The crucial point is that the limit is Brownian.\nThe question, however, asks for statements that \"correctly describe failure modes\". This statement describes a condition for the *success* of Donsker's principle. It defines a regime of mixing that is sufficiently strong, contrasting with the \"too weak\" mixing that causes failure. While mathematically correct as a theorem, it does not describe a failure mode itself. It describes a situation where failure does not occur. Therefore, it is not a correct answer to the specific question being posed.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.** The statement is a correct theorem but does not describe a failure mode as requested.\n\n**B. If $r(h) \\sim c\\, h^{-(1-2H)}$ with $H \\in (1/2,1)$ and $\\{X_k\\}$ is a centered, stationary Gaussian sequence with this long-range dependence, then $n^{-H} S_n(\\cdot)$ converges (in finite-dimensional distributions and, under standard regularity, in $C([0,1])$) to fractional Brownian motion $B^H(\\cdot)$ with Hurst parameter $H$, reflecting a failure of the $\\sqrt{n}$ normalization and the Brownian limit.**\n\nThis statement accurately describes the seminal result by Taqqu (1975). For a centered stationary Gaussian process with LRD, the limiting process for the normalized partial sums is not Brownian motion but fractional Brownian motion (fBm). The key features are correctly identified:\n1.  The normalization is $n^{-H}$, not the classical $n^{-1/2}$. This is because $\\operatorname{Var}(S_n) \\sim C n^{2H}$.\n2.  The limiting process is fractional Brownian motion $B^H(\\cdot)$, a self-similar Gaussian process with stationary increments that are dependent for $H \\ne 1/2$. For $H \\in (1/2, 1)$, there is positive correlation between increments, reflecting the LRD of the underlying sequence $\\{X_k\\}$.\nThis constitutes a fundamental failure of Donsker's invariance principle, as both the scaling exponent and the nature of the limit process are different. The statement correctly identifies this as a failure.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Under long-range dependence with $H \\in (1/2,1)$, the $\\sqrt{n}$ normalization yields $\\operatorname{Var}(n^{-1/2} S_n(1)) \\to \\infty$, and the sequence $\\{n^{-1/2} S_n(\\cdot)\\}_{n \\ge 1}$ fails to be tight in $D([0,1])$, so no functional limit under the classical scaling exists.**\n\nThis statement provides the technical reason for the failure of the classical $n^{-1/2}$ scaling in the LRD regime. As derived above, if $r(h) \\sim c h^{-(1-2H)}$, then $\\operatorname{Var}(S_n(1)) \\sim C_H n^{2H}$. Consequently, the variance of the classically scaled sum is $\\operatorname{Var}(n^{-1/2} S_n(1)) = n^{-1}\\operatorname{Var}(S_n(1)) \\sim C_H n^{2H-1}$. Since $H \\in (1/2, 1)$, the exponent $2H-1$ is strictly positive ($0 < 2H-1 < 1$), so $\\operatorname{Var}(n^{-1/2} S_n(1)) \\to \\infty$ as $n \\to \\infty$.\nA necessary condition for convergence in distribution of a sequence of random elements $\\{Z_n\\}$ in a Polish space is that the sequence of their laws is tight. For processes in $D([0,1])$, tightness implies, among other things, that for any $\\eta>0$, there exists a constant $M$ such that $\\mathbb{P}(\\sup_{t \\in [0,1]} |Z_n(t)| > M) < \\eta$ for all $n$. The diverging variance of the random variable $n^{-1/2} S_n(1)$ implies that this condition cannot be met. The probability mass \"escapes to infinity,\" so the sequence of processes $\\{n^{-1/2} S_n(\\cdot)\\}$ is not tight. Lack of tightness precludes convergence in distribution in $D([0,1])$. Therefore, no functional limit exists under this scaling. The statement is entirely correct.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. For subordinated Gaussian sequences $X_k = g(Y_k)$ where $\\{Y_k\\}$ is centered Gaussian with long-range dependence and $g$ has Hermite rank $m \\ge 2$, the properly rescaled partial sums converge to an $m$-th order Hermite process (with the Rosenblatt process arising for $m=2$), rather than to Brownian motion, indicating a non-Gaussian non-central limit due to weak mixing.**\n\nThis statement describes another crucial class of non-central limit theorems, emerging from non-linear functions of LRD Gaussian sequences. The Hermite rank $m$ of the function $g$ determines the nature of the limit. If $\\{Y_k\\}$ has LRD characterized by $r_Y(h) \\sim c h^{-d}$ with $d \\in (0,1)$, and the Hermite rank of $g$ is $m$ such that $md < 1$, then the partial sums $S_n = \\sum_{k=1}^n g(Y_k)$ with appropriate centering converge after normalization by $n^{1-md/2} L(n)$ (where $L(n)$ is a slowly varying function) to a non-Gaussian, self-similar process known as an $m$-th Hermite process. These limit theorems were developed by Taqqu and Dobrushin. For $m=2$, the limit is the Rosenblatt process. These limiting processes are non-Gaussian. This is a profound failure of Donsker's principle, as not only the scaling is non-standard, but the limiting distribution is not Gaussian. This correctly identifies a failure mode.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. Even in the long-range dependence regime, the limiting continuous-time process is a semimartingale, hence classical Itô stochastic differential equations driven by this limit remain well-posed without modification.**\n\nThis statement addresses the implications for stochastic calculus. The limiting processes that arise in the context of LRD, such as fractional Brownian motion $B^H(\\cdot)$ with $H \\in (1/2, 1)$ (from option B) and Hermite processes like the Rosenblatt process (from option D), are generally *not* semimartingales. A semimartingale is, by definition, a process that can be decomposed into a local martingale and a finite variation process. This property underpins the entire framework of Itô calculus. Since fractional Brownian motion with $H \\neq 1/2$ and higher-order Hermite processes are not semimartingales, Itô's theory of stochastic integration does not apply. Driving a stochastic differential equation with such processes requires a different, more advanced theory, such as rough path theory or stochastic calculus via Malliavin calculus. The statement is therefore fundamentally false: the limit process is not a semimartingale, and classical Itô SDEs are *not* well-posed without significant modification.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nIn summary, statements B, C, and D correctly describe distinct and important failure modes of Donsker's invariance principle in the presence of long-range dependence.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BCD}$$", "id": "2973413"}]}
