For each $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, d\\}$, we have the integral:\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{d}} \\left( g(x) b_{i}(x) \\right) \\left( \\partial_{x_{i}} f(x) \\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nThe integration by parts formula in one dimension, which follows from the divergence theorem, states that for functions $u$ and $v$ on $\\mathbb{R}^d$:\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{d}} u \\, \\partial_{x_{i}} v \\, \\mathrm{d}x = -\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{d}} v \\, \\partial_{x_{i}} u \\, \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nThis simplified form holds when boundary terms vanish. In our case, we set $u = g(x) b_{i}(x)$ and $v = f(x)$. Since $f \\in C_{c}^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^{d})$, it has compact support. Let the support of $f$ be contained in a compact set $K$. We can perform the integration over a domain $\\Omega$ that contains $K$. On the boundary $\\partial\\Omega$, $f(x)=0$. The full integration by parts formula gives a boundary term $\\int_{\\partial\\Omega} u v n_i \\, \\mathrm{d}S$, which vanishes because $f(x)=0$ on $\\partial\\Omega$.

For each pair $(i, j) \\in \\{1, \\dots, d\\}^2$, we have the integral:\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{d}} g(x) a_{ij}(x) \\partial_{x_{i} x_{j}}^{2} f(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nWe apply integration by parts twice to move the second-order partial derivative $\\partial_{x_{i} x_{j}}^{2}$ from $f$ to the product $g a_{ij}$. First, we integrate by parts with respect to $x_j$:\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{d}} \\left( g(x) a_{ij}(x) \\right) \\partial_{x_j} (\\partial_{x_i} f(x)) \\, \\mathrm{d}x = - \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{d}} (\\partial_{x_i} f(x)) \\partial_{x_j} \\left( g(x) a_{ij}(x) \\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nThe boundary term vanishes because $f \\in C_{c}^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^{d})$ implies that all its partial derivatives, including $\\partial_{x_i}f$, also have compact support and thus vanish on the boundary of any sufficiently large integration domain.\n\nNow, we apply integration by parts a second time, with respect to $x_i$, to the resulting expression:\n$$\n- \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{d}} (\\partial_{x_i} f(x)) \\left( \\partial_{x_j} (g(x) a_{ij}(x)) \\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{d}} f(x) \\partial_{x_i} \\left( \\partial_{x_j} (g(x) a_{ij}(x)) \\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nAgain, the boundary term vanishes due to the compact support of $f$. Since $g$ and $a_{ij}$ are smooth, the product $g(x)a_{ij}(x)$ is at least $C^2$ (as $g \\in C^\\infty$), so by Schwarz's theorem (or Clairaut's theorem), the order of differentiation can be interchanged: $\\partial_{x_i}\\partial_{x_j} = \\partial_{x_j}\\partial_{x_i}$. Therefore, we have:\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{d}} g(x) a_{ij}(x) \\partial_{x_{i} x_{j}}^{2} f(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{d}} f(x) \\partial_{x_{i} x_{j}}^{2} \\left( g(x) a_{ij}(x) \\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nSumming over $i$ and $j$ and including the factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$, the total diffusion term becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j=1}^{d} \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{d}} g(x) a_{ij}(x) \\partial_{x_i x_j}^{2} f(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{d}} f(x) \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j=1}^{d} \\partial_{x_{i} x_{j}}^{2} \\left( g(x) a_{ij}(x) \\right) \\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\n\nCombining the results for the drift and diffusion parts, we get:\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{d}} g(x) L f(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{d}} f(x) \\left( - \\sum_{i=1}^{d} \\partial_{x_i} (g(x) b_i(x)) + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j=1}^{d} \\partial_{x_i x_j}^{2} (g(x) a_{ij}(x)) \\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nBy comparing this with the definition $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{d}} g(x) L f(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{d}} f(x) L^{*} g(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x$, and invoking the fundamental lemma of calculus of variations (since the equality must hold for all test functions $f \\in C_{c}^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^{d})$), we can identify the integrand multiplying $f(x)$ as $L^{*}g(x)$.\n\nTherefore, the explicit expression for the action of the formal adjoint operator $L^{*}$ on a function $g \\in C_{c}^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^{d})$ is:\n$$\nL^{*} g(x) = - \\sum_{i=1}^{d} \\partial_{x_{i}} \\left( b_{i}(x) g(x) \\right) + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j=1}^{d} \\partial_{x_{i} x_{j}}^{2} \\left( a_{ij}(x) g(x) \\right)\n$$\nThis is the Fokker-Planck operator.

Substituting our result for the current, we get:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot (\\pi(x) J(x)) = 0 $$\nThis matches the first part of the statement. This condition is also known as the weighted divergence-free condition for $J$ with respect to the measure $\\pi(x)dx$.\n\nFor the second part, assume that $J$ is divergence-free in the standard sense, i.e., $\\nabla \\cdot J = 0$. Using the product rule for divergence:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot (\\pi J) = (\\nabla\\pi)\\cdot J + \\pi(\\nabla\\cdot J) $$\nSince $\\nabla\\cdot J = 0$, the condition $\\nabla \\cdot (\\pi J)=0$ simplifies to $(\\nabla\\pi)\\cdot J = 0$.\nSubstituting $\\nabla \\pi = -\\frac{1}{D}\\pi \\nabla U$:\n$$ \\left(-\\frac{1}{D}\\pi(x)\\nabla U(x)\\right) \\cdot J(x) = 0 $$\nSince $D>0$ and $\\pi(x)>0$, this is equivalent to $(\\nabla U(x)) \\cdot J(x) = 0$.\nThe statement is fully consistent with our derivation.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. If $J$ is divergence-free in the standard sense $\\nabla\\cdot J\\equiv 0$, then for any coercive potential $U$ the density $\\pi(x)\\propto \\exp(-U(x)/D)$ is invariant, regardless of the direction of $J(x)$.**\n\nThis statement claims that if $\\nabla\\cdot J = 0$, then $\\pi \\propto \\exp(-U/D)$ is always the invariant density. From the analysis of option A, we found that for this to be true, the additional condition $J(x)\\cdot \\nabla U(x) = 0$ must hold. This condition constrains the direction of $J(x)$ to be orthogonal to the gradient field $\\nabla U(x)$ everywhere. The statement \"regardless of the direction of $J(x)$\" is therefore false. For a general solenoidal field $J$, the product $J(x)\\cdot \\nabla U(x)$ will not be identically zero, and in that case, $\\pi \\propto \\exp(-U/D)$ is not the invariant density. A simple counterexample in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ is $U(x_1, x_2) = \\frac{1}{2}(x_1^2+x_2^2)$ and $J(x_1, x_2) = (1,0)$. Here $\\nabla U = (x_1, x_2)$ and $\\nabla \\cdot J = 0$, but $J \\cdot \\nabla U = x_1 \\neq 0$.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. For general smooth uniformly elliptic $a(x)$ and a smooth positive candidate density $\\pi(x)$, the steady-state equation $L^*\\pi=0$ is equivalent to the existence of a decomposition $b(x) = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,\\nabla\\cdot a(x) + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,a(x)\\,\\nabla\\log\\pi(x) + J(x)$ with a current field $J(x)$ satisfying $\\nabla\\cdot\\left(J(x)\\,\\pi(x)\\right)=0$. In this representation, the nonreversible component $J$ contributes a divergence-free probability current without altering the stationary density $\\pi$.**\n\nLet's analyze the probability current $\\mathcal{J}[\\pi]$ using the proposed decomposition of $b(x)$. First, let's expand the term $\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla\\cdot(a\\pi)$ from the definition of the current. In index notation, its $i$-th component is $\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_j \\partial_j(a_{ij}\\pi) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_j ((\\partial_j a_{ij})\\pi + a_{ij}\\partial_j\\pi)$. In vector notation, this is $\\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla\\cdot a)\\pi + \\frac{1}{2}a\\nabla\\pi$. Therefore, the probability current is:\n$$ \\mathcal{J}[\\pi] = b\\pi - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla\\cdot a)\\pi + \\frac{1}{2}a\\nabla\\pi\\right) $$\nNow, substitute the proposed decomposition of $b$ into this expression:\n$$ \\mathcal{J}[\\pi] = \\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}(\\nabla\\cdot a) + \\tfrac{1}{2}a(\\nabla\\log\\pi) + J\\right)\\pi - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla\\cdot a)\\pi + \\frac{1}{2}a\\nabla\\pi\\right) $$\nUsing $\\nabla\\log\\pi = \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\nabla\\pi$, the term $\\frac{1}{2}a(\\nabla\\log\\pi)\\pi$ simplifies to $\\frac{1}{2}a\\nabla\\pi$. The expression for the current becomes:\n$$ \\mathcal{J}[\\pi] = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla\\cdot a)\\pi + \\frac{1}{2}a\\nabla\\pi + J\\pi\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla\\cdot a)\\pi + \\frac{1}{2}a\\nabla\\pi\\right) = J\\pi $$\nSo, if the drift $b(x)$ has this decomposition, the total probability current is simply $\\mathcal{J}[\\pi] = J(x)\\pi(x)$. The stationarity condition $L^*\\pi = -\\nabla\\cdot\\mathcal{J}[\\pi] = 0$ is then equivalent to $\\nabla\\cdot(J(x)\\pi(x))=0$. This confirms the statement's logic.\n\nThis decomposition is always possible. Given $a$, $b$, and a stationary density $\\pi$, one can define the field $J(x)$ as:\n$$ J(x) := b(x) - \\left(\\tfrac{1}{2}\\,\\nabla\\cdot a(x) + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,a(x)\\,\\nabla\\log\\pi(x)\\right) $$\nThen the condition $L^*\\pi=0$ is indeed equivalent to $\\nabla\\cdot(J\\pi)=0$. The term $b_{\\mathrm{rev}}(x) = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,\\nabla\\cdot a(x) + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,a(x)\\,\\nabla\\log\\pi(x)$ is precisely the drift that makes the dynamics reversible with respect to $\\pi$ (i.e., it generates zero probability current). Thus, $J(x)$ represents the purely non-reversible part of the drift, which generates a solenoidal probability current $J\\pi$ in the steady state.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. Stationarity necessarily requires detailed balance (zero probability current), i.e., $b(x)\\,\\pi(x) - \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,\\nabla\\cdot\\left(a(x)\\,\\pi(x)\\right)\\equiv 0$. Therefore any nonzero divergence-free drift component $J$ eliminates the possibility of an invariant density.**\n\nThis statement claims that stationarity ($\\nabla\\cdot\\mathcal{J}=0$) is equivalent to detailed balance ($\\mathcal{J}=0$). This is false. Detailed balance is a sufficient, but not necessary, condition for stationarity. A system can be in a steady state with non-zero probability currents, as long as these currents are divergence-free. A classic physical example is a fluid in a steady-state vortex; there is constant motion (current), but the density at any point is constant.\n\nThe analysis in option A provides a direct counterexample. If $a=2DI_d$, $b=-\\nabla U+J$ with $\\nabla\\cdot J=0$ and $J\\cdot\\nabla U=0$, then $\\pi \\propto \\exp(-U/D)$ is an invariant density. In this case, the current is $\\mathcal{J} = J\\pi$. If $J(x)$ is not identically zero, then we have a stationary state with a non-zero current, violating detailed balance. This contradicts the first part of the statement.\n\nThe second part of the statement is a faulty conclusion from the incorrect premise. We have just shown that a nonzero divergence-free drift $J$ can be perfectly compatible with the existence of an invariant density, provided it satisfies certain conditions. Therefore, it does not \"eliminate the possibility of an invariant density.\"\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "2983105"}]}
