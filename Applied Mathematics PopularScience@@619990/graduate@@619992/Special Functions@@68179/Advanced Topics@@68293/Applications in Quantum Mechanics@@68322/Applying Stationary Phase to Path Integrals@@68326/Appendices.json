We will proceed with the derivation. The system is a one-dimensional free particle with mass $m$ and Lagrangian $L(x,\\dot{x})=\\frac{m}{2}\\dot{x}^{2}$. The action is the time integral of the Lagrangian:\n$$\nS[x(\\tau)] = \\int_{0}^{t} L(x(\\tau), \\dot{x}(\\tau))\\,d\\tau = \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{m}{2}\\dot{x}(\\tau)^{2}\\,d\\tau.\n$$\n\nPart 1: Determination of the classical path and classical action.\n\nThe classical path, $x_{\\mathrm{cl}}(\\tau)$, is the path that extremizes the action. It is found by solving the Euler-Lagrange equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} - \\frac{d}{d\\tau}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{x}}\\right) = 0.\n$$\nFor the given Lagrangian, $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{x}} = m\\dot{x}$. The Euler-Lagrange equation thus simplifies to:\n$$\n0 - \\frac{d}{d\\tau}(m\\dot{x}) = -m\\ddot{x} = 0.\n$$\nThis implies $\\ddot{x}(\\tau) = 0$, which is the equation of motion for a free particle. Integrating this equation twice with respect to $\\tau$ yields a linear path:\n$$\nx_{\\mathrm{cl}}(\\tau) = A\\tau + B.\n$$\nThe constants $A$ and $B$ are determined by the boundary conditions $x(0) = x'$ and $x(t) = x$.\nFrom $x(0) = x'$, we find $B = x'$.\nFrom $x(t) = x$, we have $At + B = x$, which gives $A = \\frac{x-x'}{t}$.\nTherefore, the unique classical path connecting the endpoints is:\n$$\nx_{\\mathrm{cl}}(\\tau) = \\frac{x-x'}{t}\\tau + x'.\n$$\nThe classical action, $S_{\\mathrm{cl}}(x,t;x',0)$, is the value of the action functional evaluated along this path. The velocity along the classical path is constant: $\\dot{x}_{\\mathrm{cl}}(\\tau) = \\frac{x-x'}{t}$.\nSubstituting this into the action integral:\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{cl}} = \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{m}{2}\\left(\\frac{x-x'}{t}\\right)^{2}\\,d\\tau = \\frac{m}{2}\\frac{(x-x')^{2}}{t^{2}} \\int_{0}^{t} d\\tau = \\frac{m(x-x')^{2}}{2t}.\n$$\n\nPart 2: Evaluation of the semiclassical propagator.\n\nThe semiclassical propagator is obtained by applying the stationary phase approximation to the path integral. We expand an arbitrary path $x(\\tau)$ around the classical path $x_{\\mathrm{cl}}(\\tau)$ as $x(\\tau) = x_{\\mathrm{cl}}(\\tau) + y(\\tau)$, where $y(\\tau)$ represents the quantum fluctuations. The fluctuation path must satisfy the boundary conditions $y(0) = 0$ and $y(t) = 0$.\nThe action for the path $x(\\tau)$ is:\n$$\nS[x] = \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{m}{2}\\left(\\dot{x}_{\\mathrm{cl}}(\\tau) + \\dot{y}(\\tau)\\right)^{2}\\,d\\tau = \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{m}{2}\\left(\\dot{x}_{\\mathrm{cl}}^{2} + 2\\dot{x}_{\\mathrm{cl}}\\dot{y} + \\dot{y}^{2}\\right)\\,d\\tau.\n$$\nThis expands to three terms:\n$$\nS[x] = \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{m}{2}\\dot{x}_{\\mathrm{cl}}^{2}\\,d\\tau + m\\int_{0}^{t}\\dot{x}_{\\mathrm{cl}}\\dot{y}\\,d\\tau + \\int_{0}^{t}\\frac{m}{2}\\dot{y}^{2}\\,d\\tau.\n$$\nThe first term is the classical action, $S_{\\mathrm{cl}}$. The second term is the first-order variation, which vanishes because $x_{\\mathrm{cl}}$ is a stationary path. This can be shown by integration by parts:\n$$\nm\\int_{0}^{t}\\dot{x}_{\\mathrm{cl}}\\dot{y}\\,d\\tau = m\\left[\\dot{x}_{\\mathrm{cl}}y\\right]_{0}^{t} - m\\int_{0}^{t}\\ddot{x}_{\\mathrm{cl}}y\\,d\\tau = m\\dot{x}_{\\mathrm{cl}}(t)y(t) - m\\dot{x}_{\\mathrm{cl}}(0)y(0) - 0 = 0.\n$$\nHere we used $y(0)=y(t)=0$ and $\\ddot{x}_{\\mathrm{cl}}=0$. The third term is the action for the fluctuations, $S^{(2)}[y] = \\int_{0}^{t}\\frac{m}{2}\\dot{y}^{2}\\,d\\tau$.\nThus, the action is exactly $S[x] = S_{\\mathrm{cl}} + S^{(2)}[y]$.\nThe path integral for the propagator becomes:\n$$\nK(x,t;x',0) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{i}{\\hbar}S_{\\mathrm{cl}}\\right) \\int_{y(0)=0}^{y(t)=0} \\mathcal{D}[y(\\tau)]\\,\\exp\\left\\{\\frac{i}{\\hbar} \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{m}{2}\\dot{y}(\\tau)^{2}\\,d\\tau\\right\\}.\n$$\nThe remaining integral is a Gaussian path integral over all paths $y(\\tau)$ starting and ending at zero. The value of this integral is a function of time, $F(t)$, and for a free particle is a standard result from path integral theory:\n$$\nF(t) = \\int_{y(0)=0}^{y(t)=0} \\mathcal{D}[y(\\tau)]\\,\\exp\\left\\{\\frac{im}{2\\hbar} \\int_{0}^{t} \\dot{y}(\\tau)^{2}\\,d\\tau\\right\\} = \\left(\\frac{m}{2\\pi i\\hbar t}\\right)^{1/2}.\n$$\nThis result is obtained by discretizing the time interval and evaluating the resulting multi-dimensional Gaussian integral, or by more advanced functional determinant methods.\nCombining the classical phase factor and the fluctuation factor gives the full propagator:\n$$\nK(x,t;x',0) = \\left(\\frac{m}{2\\pi i\\hbar t}\\right)^{1/2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{im(x-x')^{2}}{2\\hbar t}\\right).\n$$\nThis result, derived from the stationary-phase approximation, is in fact exact. The reason is that the Lagrangian for a free particle is a purely quadratic function of the velocity $\\dot{x}$. Consequently, the Taylor expansion of the action $S[x(\\tau)]$ around the classical path $x_{\\mathrm{cl}}(\\tau)$ terminates at the second-order term. There are no higher-order terms (third or higher variations are identically zero). The stationary phase method, which relies on this second-order expansion, is therefore not an approximation but an exact evaluation for systems with at most quadratic potentials.\n\nPart 3: Interpretation of $S_{\\mathrm{cl}}$ in the context of SC-IVR.\n\nThe classical action $S_{\\mathrm{cl}}(x,t;x',0)$ is Hamilton's principal function. In classical mechanics, it serves as a generating function for the canonical transformation from the initial coordinates and momenta $(x',p')$ to the final ones $(x,p)$. The initial and final momenta of the classical trajectory are given by the partial derivatives of $S_{\\mathrm{cl}}$ with respect to the initial and final positions:\n$$\np(t) = p_x = \\frac{\\partial S_{\\mathrm{cl}}}{\\partial x}, \\quad p(0) = p_{x'} = -\\frac{\\partial S_{\\mathrm{cl}}}{\\partial x'}.\n$$\nFor our calculated action $S_{\\mathrm{cl}} = \\frac{m(x-x')^{2}}{2t}$, we compute these derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial S_{\\mathrm{cl}}}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{m(x-x')^{2}}{2t}\\right) = \\frac{m}{2t} \\cdot 2(x-x') = \\frac{m(x-x')}{t}.\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial S_{\\mathrm{cl}}}{\\partial x'} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x'}\\left(\\frac{m(x-x')^{2}}{2t}\\right) = \\frac{m}{2t} \\cdot 2(x-x') \\cdot (-1) = -\\frac{m(x-x')}{t}.\n$$\nThe classical momentum for the free particle path is constant, $p_{\\mathrm{cl}} = m\\dot{x}_{\\mathrm{cl}} = m\\frac{x-x'}{t}$. Thus, we verify that $p(t) = p_{\\mathrm{cl}} = \\partial S_{\\mathrm{cl}}/\\partial x$ and $p(0) = p_{\\mathrm{cl}} = -\\partial S_{\\mathrm{cl}}/\\partial x'$.\nThis demonstrates that $S_{\\mathrm{cl}}$ correctly connects the endpoints of the trajectory to the corresponding classical momenta.\nIn the context of semiclassical methods like the Semiclassical Initial Value Representation (SC-IVR), the classical action is the central object determining the quantum phase. The SC-IVR propagator is built as a coherent sum over classical trajectories. The phase of each contribution is given by $\\exp(iS_{\\mathrm{cl}}/\\hbar)$. The amplitude is determined by the stability of the trajectory, which is related to the second derivatives of the action. For instance, the Van Vleck-Gutzwiller propagator, a precursor to modern SC-IVR, has the form:\n$$\nK_{\\mathrm{sc}}(x,t;x',0) \\propto \\left|\\det\\left(-\\frac{\\partial^2 S_{\\mathrm{cl}}}{\\partial x \\partial x'}\\right)\\right|^{1/2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{i}{\\hbar}S_{\\mathrm{cl}}\\right).\n$$\nFor our one-dimensional case, the determinant is simply $-\\frac{\\partial^2 S_{\\mathrm{cl}}}{\\partial x \\partial x'} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(-\\frac{m(x-x')}{t}\\right) = \\frac{m}{t}$. The prefactor term is then proportional to $\\sqrt{m/t}$, which is consistent with the exact fluctuation factor we derived. Therefore, $S_{\\mathrm{cl}}$ is the fundamental building block in the SC-IVR framework, encoding both the quantum phase and, through its derivatives, the amplitude modulation of the propagator.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{m}{2 \\pi i \\hbar t}\\right)^{1/2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{i m (x-x')^2}{2 \\hbar t}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2804956"}, {"introduction": "Building on the free particle example, this exercise tasks you with deriving the quantum propagator for the simple harmonic oscillator—a bedrock model in physics.
