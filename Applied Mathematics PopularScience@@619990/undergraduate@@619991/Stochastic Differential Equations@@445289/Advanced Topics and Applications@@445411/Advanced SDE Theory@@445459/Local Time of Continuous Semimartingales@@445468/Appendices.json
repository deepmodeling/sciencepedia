We shall proceed by following the three steps laid out in the problem statement to derive the final expression for $E[L_{t}^{0}(W)]$.\n\nLet $\\{W_{t}\\}_{t \\geq 0}$ be a one-dimensional standard Brownian motion starting at $W_{0} = 0$. Let $M_{t} = \\sup_{0 \\leq s \\leq t} W_{s}$ be its running maximum.\n\nStep 1: Derivation of the distribution of $M_{t}$ and its relation to $|W_{t}|$.\nWe first determine the tail distribution of $M_{t}$, which is $P(M_{t} \\geq a)$ for any real number $a$. Since $W_{0}=0$ and the paths of $W$ are continuous, $M_{t} \\geq 0$ almost surely. Thus, for any $a \\leq 0$, $P(M_{t} \\geq a) = 1$.\n\nNow, consider $a  0$. The event $\\{M_{t} \\geq a\\}$ means that the Brownian path has reached or exceeded the level $a$ at some time in the interval $[0, t]$. Let $\\tau_{a} = \\inf\\{s \\geq 0: W_{s} = a\\}$ be the first hitting time of level $a$. Then $\\{M_{t} \\geq a\\} = \\{\\tau_{a} \\leq t\\}$.\nWe use the reflection principle for Brownian motion. We can partition the event $\\{M_{t} \\geq a\\}$ as follows:\n$$P(M_{t} \\geq a) = P(M_{t} \\geq a, W_{t} \\geq a) + P(M_{t} \\geq a, W_{t}  a)$$\nIf $W_{t} \\geq a$, then its maximum over $[0, t]$ must also be at least $a$. Thus, the event $\\{M_{t} \\geq a, W_{t} \\geq a\\}$ is the same as the event $\\{W_{t} \\geq a\\}$. So,\n$$P(M_{t} \\geq a, W_{t} \\geq a) = P(W_{t} \\geq a)$$\nFor the second term, on the event $\\{M_{t} \\geq a, W_{t}  a\\}$, the process must have hit level $a$ at some time $\\tau_{a} \\leq t$ and then finished at a value below $a$. By the strong Markov property of Brownian motion, the process $\\{W_{\\tau_{a}+u} - W_{\\tau_{a}}\\}_{u \\geq 0}$ is a standard Brownian motion independent of the pre-$\\tau_{a}$ filtration. At time $\\tau_a$, we have $W_{\\tau_a}=a$. The condition $W_{t}  a$ on the set $\\{\\tau_a \\le t\\}$ is equivalent to $W_t - W_{\\tau_a}  0$. By the symmetry of Brownian motion, the probability of the process being negative at time $t-\\tau_a$ is the same as the probability of it being positive.\nThus, conditioned on the event $\\{\\tau_{a} \\leq t\\}$, we have $P(W_{t}  a) = P(W_{t}  a)$. This implies:\n$$P(M_{t} \\geq a, W_{t}  a) = P(M_{t} \\geq a, W_{t}  a)$$\nThe event $\\{M_{t} \\geq a, W_{t}  a\\}$ is simply $\\{W_{t}  a\\}$, because if $W_{t}  a$, its maximum $M_{t}$ is certainly greater than $a$. Since $W_{t}$ has a continuous distribution, $P(W_{t}  a) = P(W_{t} \\geq a)$.\nTherefore, $P(M_{t} \\geq a, W_{t}  a) = P(W_{t} \\geq a)$.\nCombining these results, we have for $a  0$:\n$$P(M_{t} \\geq a) = P(W_{t} \\geq a) + P(W_{t} \\geq a) = 2 P(W_{t} \\geq a)$$\nNow, we find the tail distribution of $|W_{t}|$. For $a \\leq 0$, $P(|W_{t}| \\geq a) = 1$, which matches $P(M_{t} \\geq a)$. For $a  0$:\n$$P(|W_{t}| \\geq a) = P(W_{t} \\geq a \\text{ or } W_{t} \\leq -a)$$\nSince these two events are disjoint, we have:\n$$P(|W_{t}| \\geq a) = P(W_{t} \\geq a) + P(W_{t} \\leq -a)$$\nBy the symmetry of the standard Brownian motion, $W_{t}$ has the same distribution as $-W_{t}$. Hence, $P(W_{t} \\leq -a) = P(-W_{t} \\geq a) = P(W_{t} \\geq a)$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for the tail probability of $|W_{t}|$:\n$$P(|W_{t}| \\geq a) = P(W_{t} \\geq a) + P(W_{t} \\geq a) = 2 P(W_{t} \\geq a)$$\nWe have shown that for all $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $P(M_{t} \\geq a) = P(|W_{t}| \\geq a)$. This implies that the random variables $M_{t}$ and $|W_{t}|$ have the same distribution, denoted $M_{t} \\stackrel{d}{=} |W_{t}|$.\n\nStep 2: Computation of $E[|W_{t}|]$.\nThe random variable $W_{t}$ follows a normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $t$, denoted $W_{t} \\sim N(0, t)$. Its probability density function (PDF) is given by:\n$$f_{W_{t}}(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{2}}{2t}\\right)$$\nThe expected value of $|W_{t}|$ is computed by integrating $|x|$ against this density:\n$$E[|W_{t}|] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |x| \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{2}}{2t}\\right) dx$$\nThe integrand is an even function of $x$. We can therefore simplify the integral:\n$$E[|W_{t}|] = 2 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} x \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{2}}{2t}\\right) dx = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} x \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{2}}{2t}\\right) dx$$\nTo evaluate the integral, we perform a substitution. Let $u = \\frac{x^{2}}{2t}$. Then $du = \\frac{2x}{2t} dx = \\frac{x}{t} dx$, which implies $x \\, dx = t \\, du$. The limits of integration remain $0$ to $\\infty$.\n$$E[|W_{t}|] = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-u) (t \\, du) = \\frac{2t}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-u) du$$\nThe standard integral $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-u) du = [-\\exp(-u)]_{0}^{\\infty} = -(0 - 1) = 1$.\nSubstituting this result back, we get:\n$$E[|W_{t}|] = \\frac{2t}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} = \\frac{2t}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sqrt{t}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{t}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4t}{2\\pi}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2t}{\\pi}}$$\n\nStep 3: Justification that $E[L_{t}^{0}(W)] = E[|W_{t}|]$.\nWe apply Tanaka's formula to the process $W_{t}$ and the function $f(x) = |x|$. For a level $a=0$ and starting point $W_0=0$, Tanaka's formula states:\n$$|W_{t}| - |W_{0}| = \\int_{0}^{t} \\text{sgn}(W_{s}) dW_{s} + L_{t}^{0}(W)$$\nwhere we use the standard definition of local time that appears in this identity. Since $W_{0}=0$, this simplifies to:\n$$|W_{t}| = \\int_{0}^{t} \\text{sgn}(W_{s}) dW_{s} + L_{t}^{0}(W)$$\nWe take the expectation of both sides of this equation:\n$$E[|W_{t}|] = E\\left[\\int_{0}^{t} \\text{sgn}(W_{s}) dW_{s}\\right] + E[L_{t}^{0}(W)]$$\nLet us analyze the stochastic integral term, $I_{t} = \\int_{0}^{t} \\text{sgn}(W_{s}) dW_{s}$. The integrand is $H_{s} = \\text{sgn}(W_{s})$. This process is adapted to the filtration generated by $W$. To determine if $I_{t}$ is a martingale, we check the Itô isometry condition:\n$$E\\left[\\int_{0}^{t} H_{s}^{2} ds\\right] = E\\left[\\int_{0}^{t} (\\text{sgn}(W_{s}))^{2} ds\\right]$$\nThe set of times $\\{s \\in [0,t] : W_{s} = 0\\}$ has Lebesgue measure zero almost surely. Thus, $(\\text{sgn}(W_{s}))^{2} = 1$ for almost every $s \\in [0,t]$.\n$$E\\left[\\int_{0}^{t} 1 \\, ds\\right] = E[t] = t$$\nSince $t  \\infty$, the stochastic integral $I_{t}$ is a true martingale. The martingale starts at $I_{0} = 0$. A fundamental property of martingales is that their expectation is constant over time. Therefore, for all $t \\geq 0$:\n$$E[I_{t}] = E[I_{0}] = 0$$\nHence, $E\\left[\\int_{0}^{t} \\text{sgn}(W_{s}) dW_{s}\\right] = 0$.\nSubstituting this back into the expectation of Tanaka's formula yields:\n$$E[|W_{t}|] = 0 + E[L_{t}^{0}(W)]$$\nThis gives the desired identity: $E[L_{t}^{0}(W)] = E[|W_{t}|]$.\n\nFinal Task: Provide the closed-form expression.\nBy combining the results from Step 2 and Step 3, we obtain the final answer.\nFrom Step 3, $E[L_{t}^{0}(W)] = E[|W_{t}|]$.\nFrom Step 2, $E[|W_{t}|] = \\sqrt{\\frac{2t}{\\pi}}$.\nTherefore, the expected local time of a standard Brownian motion at level $0$ up to time $t$ is:\n$$E[L_{t}^{0}(W)] = \\sqrt{\\frac{2t}{\\pi}}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{\\frac{2t}{\\pi}}}$$", "id": "3064283"}, {"introduction": "Building on the foundational case of standard Brownian motion, this practice challenges you to generalize the method to a wider class of diffusions.
