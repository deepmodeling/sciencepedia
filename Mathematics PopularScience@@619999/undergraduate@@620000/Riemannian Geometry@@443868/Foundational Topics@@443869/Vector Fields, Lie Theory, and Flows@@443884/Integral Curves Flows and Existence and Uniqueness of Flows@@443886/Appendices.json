Provide your final expression without units.", "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated and found to be valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded, and objective problem within the domain of differential geometry and the theory of ordinary differential equations. All necessary information is provided, and the premises are consistent and mathematically sound. We may therefore proceed with a full derivation.\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the flow $\\varphi_t$ generated by a constant vector field $X$ on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. A constant vector field is given by $X(p) = v$ for all $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, where $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is a fixed vector.\n\n1.  **Derivation of the Integral Curve**\n\nBy definition, an integral curve $\\gamma(t)$ is a differentiable curve that satisfies the ordinary differential equation (ODE) $\\gamma'(t) = X(\\gamma(t))$. For the specific vector field $X(p)=v$, this ODE becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\gamma}{dt}(t) = v\n$$\nThis is a simple vector-valued ODE. We can find the general solution by integrating both sides with respect to the parameter $t$:\n$$\n\\gamma(t) = \\int v \\, dt = tv + C\n$$\nwhere $C \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is a constant vector of integration.\n\nThe problem specifies an initial condition $\\gamma(0)=p$ for some starting point $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. We use this condition to find the particular solution $\\gamma_p(t)$. Substituting $t=0$ into the general solution:\n$$\n\\gamma_p(0) = (0)v + C = C\n$$\nSince we require $\\gamma_p(0)=p$, we must have $C=p$. Thus, the unique integral curve starting at $p$ is given by the explicit formula:\n$$\n\\gamma_p(t) = p + tv\n$$\n\n2.  **Global Existence of the Flow**\n\nThe problem asks to argue that the flow is defined for all times $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The existence and uniqueness of solutions to an initial value problem $\\gamma'(t) = F(\\gamma(t))$ are guaranteed by the Picard-Lindelöf theorem, provided $F$ is locally Lipschitz. For a solution to exist for all time $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$ (i.e., for the flow to be \"complete\"), a sufficient condition is that the vector field is globally Lipschitz.\n\nIn our case, the right-hand side of the ODE is the function $F(p) = X(p) = v$. Let's check the global Lipschitz condition. For any two points $p_1, p_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, we examine the norm of the difference:\n$$\n\\|F(p_1) - F(p_2)\\| = \\|v - v\\| = 0\n$$\nA function $F$ is globally Lipschitz if there exists a constant $L \\ge 0$ such that $\\|F(p_1) - F(p_2)\\| \\le L \\|p_1 - p_2\\|$ for all $p_1, p_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. In our case, this inequality is:\n$$\n0 \\le L \\|p_1 - p_2\\|\n$$\nThis inequality holds for any non-negative Lipschitz constant $L$; for example, we can choose $L=0$. Since the vector field $X$ is globally Lipschitz (and also smooth, i.e., $C^\\infty$), the fundamental theory of ODEs guarantees that for any initial point $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, a unique solution $\\gamma_p(t)$ exists and is defined for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. As the flow $\\varphi_t$ is defined by $\\varphi_t(p) = \\gamma_p(t)$, the flow is also defined for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\n3.  **The One-Parameter Group Law**\n\nThe flow map $\\varphi_t: \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$ is given by the expression we derived for the integral curve:\n$$\n\\varphi_t(p) = p + tv\n$$\nThis map represents a rigid translation of the entire space $\\mathbb{R}^n$ in the direction of $v$ over a \"distance\" proportional to $t$.\n\nWe must now verify that this flow satisfies the one-parameter group law: $\\varphi_{t+s} = \\varphi_t \\circ \\varphi_s$ for all $t, s \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We do this by applying both sides of the equation to an arbitrary point $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and showing the results are identical.\n\n-   **Left-Hand Side (LHS):**\n    $$\n    \\varphi_{t+s}(p) = p + (t+s)v = p + tv + sv\n    $$\n\n-   **Right-Hand Side (RHS):** The RHS is a composition of maps, $(\\varphi_t \\circ \\varphi_s)(p) = \\varphi_t(\\varphi_s(p))$.\n    First, we evaluate the inner map:\n    $$\n    \\varphi_s(p) = p + sv\n    $$\n    Next, we apply the outer map $\\varphi_t$ to the resulting point, $p + sv$:\n    $$\n    \\varphi_t(p + sv) = (p + sv) + tv = p + sv + tv\n    $$\n\nComparing the two results, we find that LHS = $p + tv + sv$ and RHS = $p + sv + tv$. Since vector addition is commutative, these two expressions are identical for all $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ and all $t, s \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This confirms that the maps are equal: $\\varphi_{t+s} = \\varphi_t \\circ \\varphi_s$.\n\n4.  **Final Expression for the Flow Map**\n\nThe explicit, closed-form analytic expression for the flow map $\\varphi_t(p)$ in terms of $p$, $t$, and $v$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\varphi_t(p) = p + tv\n$$\nThis is the final expression requested by the problem.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{p + tv}\n$$", "id": "3051934"}, {"introduction": "Building on the constant case, we now investigate flows generated by linear vector fields of the form $X(x) = Ax$.

Compute the Jacobian matrix $D\\varphi_{t}(x)$ explicitly for all $t\\in\\mathbb{R}$ and $x\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3}$.\n\nSince the flow map $\\varphi_t(x)$ is linear in the variable $x$, its Jacobian matrix, denoted $D\\varphi_t(x)$, is the matrix that represents this linear transformation. Thus, the Jacobian matrix is independent of $x$ and is given by:\n$$\nD\\varphi_t(x) = \\exp(tA)\n$$\nTo compute $\\exp(tA)$, we observe that $A$ is a block-diagonal matrix:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} B  0 \\\\ 0  C \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\text{where} \\quad B = \\begin{pmatrix} -1  1 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad C = \\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe exponential of a block-diagonal matrix is the block-diagonal matrix of the exponentials of its blocks, so $\\exp(tA) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\exp(tB)  0 \\\\ 0  \\exp(tC) \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe exponential of the $1 \\times 1$ block is $\\exp(tC) = \\exp(3t)$.\nFor the $2 \\times 2$ block $B$, we decompose it into the sum of a scalar matrix and a nilpotent matrix: $B = -I + N$, where $I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix and $N = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix}$. Since $-I$ and $N$ commute, we have $\\exp(tB) = \\exp(t(-I+N)) = \\exp(-tI) \\exp(tN)$.\nThe exponential of $-tI$ is $\\begin{pmatrix} \\exp(-t)  0 \\\\ 0  \\exp(-t) \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe matrix $N$ is nilpotent with $N^2=0$, so the power series for its exponential truncates:\n$$\n\\exp(tN) = I + tN + \\frac{(tN)^2}{2!} + \\dots = I + tN = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  t \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\n\\exp(tB) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\exp(-t)  0 \\\\ 0  \\exp(-t) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  t \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\exp(-t)  t\\exp(-t) \\\\ 0  \\exp(-t) \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nAssembling the blocks, the Jacobian matrix is:\n$$\nD\\varphi_t(x) = \\exp(tA) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\exp(-t)  t\\exp(-t)  0 \\\\ 0  \\exp(-t)  0 \\\\ 0  0  \\exp(3t) \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\n\n$3$.

Interpret the stability of the equilibrium at the origin from the eigenvalues of $A$.\n\nThe origin is an equilibrium point because $X(0) = A \\cdot 0 = 0$. For a linear system, the stability of an equilibrium is determined by the eigenvalues of the matrix $A$.

The norm of $X$ at a point $x$ is:\n$$\n\\|X(x)\\|_g = \\sqrt{g_x(X(x), X(x))} = \\sqrt{g_x\\left(x^2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}, x^2 \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\right)} = \\sqrt{(x^2)^2 g_{11}} = \\sqrt{(x^2)^2 \\cdot 1} = |x^2| = x^2\n$$\nThe norm of the vector field, $\\|X(x)\\|_g = x^2$, is clearly not bounded on $\\mathbb{R}$. As the integral curve moves to points with larger $|x|$, its speed, given by the norm of the vector field, increases quadratically. This rapid \"acceleration\" causes the curve to travel an infinite distance in a finite amount of time.\n\nIf the manifold were compact (e.g., the circle $S^1$), any smooth vector field would necessarily be bounded, and by a related theorem, its flow would be complete, meaning all integral curves would be defined for all time $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$. In this problem, the combination of a non-compact manifold and an unbounded vector field allows for the existence of incomplete integral curves.\n\nIn summary, the obstruction to extending $\\gamma$ beyond $T_{+}=1$ is that the integral curve escapes to infinity in finite time, a behavior permitted by the non-compactness of $\\mathbb{R}$ and the unbounded growth of the vector field $X$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "3051942"}]}
