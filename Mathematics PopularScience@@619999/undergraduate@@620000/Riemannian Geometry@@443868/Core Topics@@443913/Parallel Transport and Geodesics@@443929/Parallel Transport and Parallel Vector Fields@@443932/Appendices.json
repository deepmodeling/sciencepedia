It is a standard exercise in Riemannian geometry concerning parallel transport on a flat manifold. All terms are well-defined, and sufficient information is provided to arrive at a unique solution.

The use of spherical coordinates, including the singularity at the pole, is a typical feature of such problems and does not render the problem invalid, but rather requires careful handling. The identification of the tangent space at the north pole with the $xy$-plane is a common convention. The problem is scientifically grounded, objective, self-contained, and consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem asks for the result of parallel transporting a vector along a curve on the unit sphere $S^2$. We will work with the embedding of $S^2$ in the ambient Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n1.  **Represent the curve and initial vector in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.**\n    The curve $\\gamma$ is the meridian defined by $\\lambda=0$ and $\\varphi$ decreasing from $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ to $0$. We can parameterize this curve using a parameter $t \\in [0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]$ by setting $\\varphi(t) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - t$ and $\\lambda(t) = 0$. The position vector $R(t)$ for a point on the curve is given by the embedding:\n    $$R(t) = (\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2}-t)\\cos(0), \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2}-t)\\sin(0), \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}-t)) = (\\cos t, 0, \\sin t)$$\n    At $t=0$, $R(0) = (1,0,0) = p$. At $t=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, $R(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = (0,0,1) = n$. This parameterization correctly describes the path from $p$ to $n$.\n\n    The initial vector $v_0$ is the unit tangent vector at $p$ in the direction of increasing longitude. This corresponds to the vector $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\lambda}$. We find its representation in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ by differentiating the position vector $R(\\varphi, \\lambda)$:\n    $$\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial \\lambda} = (-\\sin\\varphi\\sin\\lambda, \\sin\\varphi\\cos\\lambda, 0)$$\n    At point $p$, we have $(\\varphi, \\lambda) = (\\frac{\\pi}{2}, 0)$. Evaluating the vector at this point:\n    $$ \\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial \\lambda}\\bigg|_{p} = (-\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2})\\sin(0), \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2})\\cos(0), 0) = (0, 1, 0) $$\n    The norm of this vector is $\\sqrt{g_{\\lambda\\lambda}|_{p}} = \\sqrt{\\sin^2(\\frac{\\pi}{2})} = 1$. So, the initial vector is $v_0 = (0,1,0)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n2.  **Use the properties of parallel transport along a geodesic.**\n    A meridian on a sphere is a great circle, which is a geodesic. For a vector field $V(t)$ to be parallel-transported along a curve $\\gamma(t)$ on a surface embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, its covariant derivative along the curve must be zero: $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} V = 0$. This condition is equivalent to stating that the ambient derivative $\\frac{dV}{dt}$ is purely normal to the tangent space of the surface at each point, i.e., $ \\frac{dV}{dt} \\perp T_{\\gamma(t)}S^2 $.\n\n    Since our curve $\\gamma$ is a geodesic, there is a significant simplification. Let's consider a constant vector field $V(t) = v_c$ in the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^3$. For this field, the ambient derivative is $\\frac{dV}{dt} = 0$. This trivially satisfies the condition $ \\frac{dV}{dt} \\perp T_{\\gamma(t)}S^2 $. Thus, a constant vector field in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ is parallel-transported along any curve $\\gamma$ on the sphere, provided that it remains tangent to the sphere at every point along the curve.\n\n3.  **Verify the tangency condition.**\n    Let's test if the constant vector field $V(t) = v_0 = (0,1,0)$ is a valid tangent vector field along the curve $\\gamma(t)$. A vector is tangent to the sphere at a point if it is orthogonal to the position vector (the normal vector) at that point. We must check if $V(t) \\cdot R(t) = 0$ for all $t \\in [0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]$.\n    $$ V(t) \\cdot R(t) = (0,1,0) \\cdot (\\cos t, 0, \\sin t) = 0 \\cdot \\cos t + 1 \\cdot 0 + 0 \\cdot \\sin t = 0 $$\n    The condition is satisfied for all $t$. The initial vector $v_0$ at $t=0$ is indeed $(0,1,0)$. Therefore, the parallel transport of $v_0$ along the geodesic $\\gamma$ is the constant vector field $V(t)=(0,1,0)$ in the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^3$.\n\n4.  **Determine the final vector and its angle.**\n    The parallel transport ends at the north pole $n$ at parameter value $t=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. The final transported vector, $v_f$, is:\n    $$ v_f = V(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = (0,1,0) $$\n    This vector is in the tangent space $T_nS^2$ because it is orthogonal to the position vector of the north pole, $n=(0,0,1)$: $v_f \\cdot n = (0,1,0)\\cdot(0,0,1) = 0$.\n\n    The problem asks for the angle $\\alpha$ of this final vector in the tangent plane $T_nS^2$, which is identified with the plane $\\{(x,y,0) \\in \\mathbb{R}^3\\}$. Under this identification, the vector $v_f = (0,1,0)$ corresponds to the vector $(0,1)$ in the standard $xy$-plane. The \"positive $x$-axis\" in the problem corresponds to the vector $(1,0)$.\n\n    The angle $\\alpha$ is the standard counterclockwise angle from the positive $x$-axis (direction $(1,0)$) to the vector $(0,1)$. This vector lies on the positive $y$-axis. The angle is therefore $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$$", "id": "3061487"}]}
