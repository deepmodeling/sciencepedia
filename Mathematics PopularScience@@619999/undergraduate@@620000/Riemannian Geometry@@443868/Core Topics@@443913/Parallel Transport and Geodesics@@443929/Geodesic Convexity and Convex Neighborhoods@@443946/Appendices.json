It is scientifically grounded within the established framework of Riemannian geometry, mathematically well-posed, and all terms and conditions are objective and precisely defined. The problem is self-contained and presents a standard, non-trivial exercise in differential geometry.\n\nThe solution is presented in three parts as requested by the problem.\n\n1. The geodesic equation in local coordinates is derived from the definition that a geodesic $\\gamma(t)$ is a curve whose velocity vector field is parallel along itself. This condition is expressed as $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} \\dot{\\gamma} = 0$, where $\\nabla$ is the Levi-Civita connection and $\\dot{\\gamma}$ is the velocity vector field of the curve $\\gamma$.\n\nLet the curve $\\gamma(t)$ be represented in a local coordinate chart by $x(t) = (x^1(t), \\dots, x^n(t))$. The velocity vector $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$ is a tangent vector at the point $\\gamma(t)$, which can be expressed in terms of the coordinate basis $\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}\\}$ as:\n$$\n\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{dx^i}{dt}(t) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i} \\equiv \\dot{x}^i(t) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^i}\n$$\nIn this notation, we use the Einstein summation convention where repeated upper and lower indices are summed over from $1$ to $n$.\n\nThe covariant derivative of a vector field $V = V^k \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}$ along the curve $\\gamma(t)$ is given by:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} V = \\left( \\frac{d V^k}{dt} + \\Gamma^k_{ij} V^i \\dot{x}^j \\right) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x^k}\n$$\nwhere $\\Gamma^k_{ij}$ are the Christoffel symbols of the Levi-Civita connection in the chosen coordinates.\n\nTo find the geodesic equation, we apply this formula to the velocity field $\\dot{\\gamma}$ itself, so we set $V = \\dot{\\gamma}$. The components of $V$ are $V^i = \\dot{x}^i$. Substituting this into the formula for the covariant derivative, we get the components of $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} \\dot{\\gamma}$:\n$$\n(\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} \\dot{\\gamma})^k = \\frac{d \\dot{x}^k}{dt} + \\Gamma^k_{ij}(x(t))\\, \\dot{x}^i(t)\\, \\dot{x}^j(t)\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{d \\dot{x}^k}{dt}$ is the second derivative of the coordinate function $x^k(t)$ with respect to $t$, which is denoted by $\\ddot{x}^k(t)$.\n\nThe defining property of a geodesic, $\\nabla_{\\dot{\\gamma}} \\dot{\\gamma} = 0$, means that each component of this vector must be zero. Therefore, for each $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, we obtain the geodesic equation in local coordinates:\n$$\n\\ddot{x}^k(t) + \\Gamma^k_{ij}(x(t))\\, \\dot{x}^i(t)\\, \\dot{x}^j(t) = 0\n$$\nThis is a system of $n$ second-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for the coordinate functions $x^k(t)$.\n\n2. To explain why small coordinate balls $B_r(0)$ are natural candidates for geodesically convex neighborhoods, we analyze the geodesic equation using ODE theory. A neighborhood is geodesically convex if for any two points in it, there exists a unique minimizing geodesic connecting them that is entirely contained within the neighborhood.\n\nThe geodesic equation can be written as a first-order system by introducing the velocity variables $v^k = \\dot{x}^k$:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\dot{x}^k = v^k \\\\\n\\dot{v}^k = - \\Gamma^k_{ij}(x) v^i v^j\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis is a system of $2n$ first-order ODEs for the state vector $(x(t), v(t)) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2n}$. Since $(M,g)$ is a smooth manifold, the metric components $g_{ij}$ are smooth functions of the coordinates, and consequently, the Christoffel symbols $\\Gamma^k_{ij}(x)$ are also smooth. The right-hand side of the ODE system is a smooth (and thus locally Lipschitz) function of $(x, v)$. The Picard-Lindelöf theorem (the fundamental theorem of existence and uniqueness for ODEs) then guarantees that for any initial condition $(x_0, v_0)$, there exists a unique solution (a unique geodesic) defined on some time interval.\n\nIn normal coordinates centered at $p$ (so $\\varphi(p)=0$), by definition, $\\Gamma^k_{ij}(0) = 0$ for all $i,j,k$. At the point $p$ itself, the geodesic equation simplifies to $\\ddot{x}^k(0) = 0$. This means geodesics passing through $p$ have zero acceleration at $p$ in these coordinates, behaving momentarily like straight lines.\n\nThe given bound $|\\Gamma^{k}_{ij}(x)\\,u^{i}u^{j}| \\leq L\\,|x|\\,|u|^{2}$ quantifies how the Christoffel symbols, and thus the \"force\" term causing geodesics to curve, grow as one moves away from the origin $p$. The term is of order $O(|x|)$, which is small near $p$.\n\nConsider the squared distance from the origin in the coordinate chart, $f(t) = |x(t)|^2 = \\sum_k (x^k(t))^2$.

Let $\\mathbf{\\Gamma}(x, \\dot{x})$ be the vector with components $\\ddot{x}^k = -\\Gamma^k_{ij}(x)\\dot{x}^i\\dot{x}^j$. The magnitude of each component is bounded: $|\\ddot{x}^k| \\leq L|x||\\dot{x}|^2$. The magnitude of the acceleration vector is thus bounded: $|\\ddot{x}| \\le \\sqrt{n} L |x| |\\dot{x}|^2$.\nTherefore, $|x^k \\ddot{x}^k| = |\\langle x, \\ddot{x} \\rangle| \\le |x||\\ddot{x}| \\le \\sqrt{n} L |x|^2 |\\dot{x}|^2$.\nThis leads to:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 |x|^2}{dt^2} \\ge 2 |\\dot{x}|^2 - 2\\sqrt{n} L |x|^2 |\\dot{x}|^2 = 2 |\\dot{x}|^2 (1 - \\sqrt{n} L |x|^2)\n$$\nFor a coordinate ball $B_r(0)$ with $r$ small enough such that $1 - \\sqrt{n} L r^2  0$, the function $|x(t)|^2$ is strictly convex for any geodesic segment within the ball. For a convex function $h(t)$ on an interval $[t_1, t_2]$, its value is bounded by the maximum of its values at the endpoints: $h(t) \\le \\max(h(t_1), h(t_2))$. If we have a geodesic connecting two points $x_1, x_2 \\in B_r(0)$, this convexity argument implies that $|x(t)|^2 \\le \\max(|x_1|^2, |x_2|^2)  r^2$, so the entire geodesic segment remains inside $B_r(0)$. This demonstrates that geodesics starting and ending in a sufficiently small ball are 'trapped' within it, which is the essence of geodesic convexity. Therefore, small coordinate balls are indeed the natural candidates for such neighborhoods.\n\n3.

A set $U \\subset \\mathbb{S}^{2}$ is defined as geodesically convex if for every pair of points $x,y \\in U$, there exists a unique minimizing geodesic segment from $x$ to $y$ that is entirely contained within $U$.\n\nWe must verify two conditions for $B_r(p)$ to be geodesically convex:\n1.  **Uniqueness:** For any two points $x, y \\in B_r(p)$, the minimizing geodesic connecting them must be unique.\n2.  **Containment:** This unique minimizing geodesic must be entirely contained within $B_r(p)$.\n\nLet's analyze these two conditions to find the constraint on the radius $r$.\n\n**1. The Uniqueness Condition and the Cut Locus**\n\nOn the sphere $\\mathbb{S}^2$, geodesics are arcs of great circles. The minimizing geodesic between any two points $x$ and $y$ is unique if and only if they are not antipodal points. If $y = -x$ (i.e., $y$ is the antipode of $x$), there are infinitely many minimizing geodesics of length $\\pi$ connecting them.\n\nThe definition of geodesic convexity requires the minimizing geodesic to be unique. Therefore, a necessary condition for $B_r(p)$ to be geodesically convex is that it must not contain any pair of antipodal points.\n\nLet's formalize this. We require that for any point $x \\in B_r(p)$, its antipode $-x$ is not in $B_r(p)$.\nThe condition $x \\in B_r(p)$ means $d(p,x)  r$.\nThe condition $-x \\notin B_r(p)$ means $d(p,-x) \\ge r$.\n\nOn the unit sphere $\\mathbb{S}^2$, for any two points $p$ and $x$, the geodesic distances to $x$ and its antipode $-x$ are related by the identity $d(p,x) + d(p,-x) = \\pi$. This relation is a direct consequence of the fact that the cut locus of $p$ is its antipodal point $-p$, which is at a distance of $\\pi$ from $p$ along any great circle.\n\nUsing this identity, the condition $d(p,-x) \\ge r$ becomes $\\pi - d(p,x) \\ge r$, which can be rewritten as $d(p,x) \\le \\pi - r$.\n\nSo, for $B_r(p)$ to contain no antipodal pairs, the inequality $d(p,x) \\le \\pi - r$ must hold for every $x$ such that $d(p,x)  r$. This implies that the interval $[0, r)$ must be a subset of the interval $(-\\infty, \\pi-r]$. This is true if and only if the upper bound of the first interval is less than or equal to the upper bound of the second interval:\n$$\nr \\le \\pi - r\n$$\nSolving for $r$, we get:\n$$\n2r \\le \\pi \\implies r \\le \\frac{\\pi}{2}\n$$\nIf $r  \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, then $\\pi - r  r$. We can then choose a point $x \\in \\mathbb{S}^2$ such that $\\pi - r  d(p,x)  r$. For such an $x$, we have $x \\in B_r(p)$ by definition. The distance to its antipode is $d(p,-x) = \\pi - d(p,x)$. Since $d(p,x)  \\pi-r$, we have $d(p, -x)  \\pi - (\\pi-r) = r$. Thus, $-x$ is also in $B_r(p)$. This pair of antipodal points $(x, -x)$ within $B_r(p)$ violates the uniqueness condition for geodesic convexity.\n\nTherefore, we must have $r \\le \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\n**2. The Containment Condition**\n\nNow we must verify that if $r \\le \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, the containment condition holds. That is, for any $x, y \\in B_r(p)$, the unique minimizing geodesic $\\gamma$ from $x$ to $y$ is entirely contained within $B_r(p)$.\n\nThe condition for a point $z$ to be in $B_r(p)$ is $d(p,z)  r$. We need to show that for any point $z$ on the geodesic segment $\\gamma$ between $x$ and $y$, $d(p,z)  r$.\n\nLet us consider the function $f: B_{\\pi}(p) \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined by $f(q) = d(p,q)$. A fundamental result from Riemannian geometry states that for a Riemannian manifold with constant sectional curvature $K$, the Hessian of the distance function $f(q)=d(p,q)$ evaluated on a vector $v$ orthogonal to the radial direction is given by $\\sqrt{K}\\cot(\\sqrt{K}d(p,q))|v|^2$. For $\\mathbb{S}^2$, we have $K=1$. The Hessian is positive definite as long as $\\cot(d(p,q))  0$, which holds for $d(p,q) \\in (0, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$. This implies that the distance function $f(q) = d(p,q)$ is a strictly convex function on the open ball $B_{\\pi/2}(p)$.\n\nLet $r \\le \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Then the ball $B_r(p)$ is a subset of $B_{\\pi/2}(p)$, on which the function $f(q) = d(p,q)$ is convex. Let $x, y \\in B_r(p)$, and let $\\gamma(t)$, with $t \\in [0,1]$, be the unique minimizing geodesic from $x$ to $y$. Because $B_{\\pi/2}(p)$ is itself geodesically convex (as an open hemisphere), the segment $\\gamma$ is contained in $B_{\\pi/2}(p)$.\n\nConsider the composite function $g(t) = f(\\gamma(t)) = d(p, \\gamma(t))$. Since $f$ is a convex function and $\\gamma(t)$ is a geodesic, $g(t)$ is a convex function of $t$.\n\nBy the maximum principle for convex functions, a convex function on a closed interval attains its maximum at the endpoints of the interval. Thus, for any $t \\in [0,1]$:\n$$\ng(t) \\le \\max(g(0), g(1))\n$$\nSubstituting the definitions of $g$, $\\gamma$, $x$, and $y$:\n$$\nd(p, \\gamma(t)) \\le \\max(d(p,x), d(p,y))\n$$\nSince $x, y \\in B_r(p)$, we have $d(p,x)  r$ and $d(p,y)  r$. Therefore:\n$$\nd(p, \\gamma(t))  r\n$$\nThis shows that every point on the geodesic segment $\\gamma$ is also in $B_r(p)$.

The failure for $r  \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ is directly tied to the ball becoming large enough to contain antipodal points, one of which lies in the cut locus of the other, violating the uniqueness of minimizing geodesics.

Injectivity Radius**\n\nThe injectivity radius at $p$, $\\operatorname{inj}(p)$, is the supremum of radii $r  0$ such that the map $\\exp_p$ restricted to the open ball $B(0, r) \\subset T_p\\mathbb{T}^n \\cong \\mathbb{R}^n$ is a diffeomorphism onto its image. Since the metric is flat, the differential of $\\exp_p$ is an isometry at every point, so $\\exp_p$ is always a local diffeomorphism. Failure to be a diffeomorphism on $B(0,r)$ can only arise from a failure of injectivity.\n\nLet us determine when $\\exp_p$ is not injective on $B(0,r)$.

Geodesic Convexity**\n\nAn open metric ball $B(p, r_*)$ is geodesically convex if for any two points $q_1, q_2 \\in B(p, r_*)$, there is a unique minimizing geodesic connecting them, and this geodesic is entirely contained within $B(p, r_*)$. We seek the largest radius $r_*(\\Lambda)$ for which this holds for any $p$.\n\nLet $r_*(\\Lambda)$ be a radius to be determined. Consider any $p \\in \\mathbb{T}^n$ and the ball $B(p, r_*(\\Lambda))$. Let $q_1, q_2$ be any two points in this ball. Thus, $d(p, q_1)  r_*(\\Lambda)$ and $d(p, q_2)  r_*(\\Lambda)$.\n\nFirst, for there to be a unique minimizing geodesic between $q_1$ and $q_2$, their distance must be less than the injectivity radius of the manifold, which is $\\operatorname{inj}(\\mathbb{T}^n) = \\inf_{p \\in \\mathbb{T}^n} \\operatorname{inj}(p) = \\ell(\\Lambda)/2$. By the triangle inequality on $\\mathbb{T}^n$, we have:\n$$\nd(q_1, q_2) \\leq d(q_1, p) + d(p, q_2)  r_*(\\Lambda) + r_*(\\Lambda) = 2r_*(\\Lambda)\n$$\nTo guarantee uniqueness of the minimizing geodesic for any pair $q_1, q_2$ in the ball, we must ensure that the upper bound on their distance is less than the injectivity radius:\n$$\n2r_*(\\Lambda)  \\frac{\\ell(\\Lambda)}{2} \\implies r_*(\\Lambda)  \\frac{\\ell(\\Lambda)}{4}\n$$\nSo, let's test if $r_*(\\Lambda) = \\ell(\\Lambda)/4$ works. Any open ball of radius $r  \\ell(\\Lambda)/4$ will satisfy this condition. The problem asks for the radius of an open ball, so we can take the supremum of these valid radii, $r_*(\\Lambda) = \\ell(\\Lambda)/4$.\n\nLet $r_* = \\ell(\\Lambda)/4$. Let $q_1, q_2 \\in B(p, r_*)$. As shown above, $d(q_1, q_2)  2r_* = \\ell(\\Lambda)/2$, so there is indeed a unique minimizing geodesic $\\gamma: [0, L] \\to \\mathbb{T}^n$ connecting them, where $L=d(q_1,q_2)$. We now must show that $\\gamma$ is contained in $B(p, r_*)$.\n\nLet $\\tilde{p} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ be a lift of $p$. Since $r_*=\\ell(\\Lambda)/4  \\ell(\\Lambda)/2$, the open ball $B(p, r_*)$ lifts isometrically to the open ball $B(\\tilde{p}, r_*)$ in the universal cover $\\mathbb{R}^n$. This means that for any point $q \\in B(p, r_*)$, there is a unique lift $\\tilde{q} \\in B(\\tilde{p}, r_*)$ and $d(p,q) = |\\tilde{p}-\\tilde{q}|$. Let $\\tilde{q}_1$ and $\\tilde{q}_2$ be the unique lifts of $q_1$ and $q_2$ in $B(\\tilde{p}, r_*)$. We have $|\\tilde{p} - \\tilde{q}_1|  r_*$ and $|\\tilde{p} - \\tilde{q}_2|  r_*$.\n\nThe unique minimizing geodesic $\\gamma$ is the projection of the straight line segment $\\tilde{\\gamma}(t) = (1-t)\\tilde{q}_1 + t\\tilde{q}_2$ for $t \\in [0,1]$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. We need to show that $d(p, \\gamma(t))  r_*$ for all $t \\in [0,1]$.\nThe distance on the torus is given by $d(p, \\gamma(t)) = d(\\pi(\\tilde{p}), \\pi(\\tilde{\\gamma}(t))) = \\min_{\\lambda \\in \\Lambda} |\\tilde{\\gamma}(t) - \\tilde{p} - \\lambda|$.\n\nLet's estimate the term for $\\lambda=0$. By the convexity of the Euclidean norm on $\\mathbb{R}^n$:\n$$\n|\\tilde{\\gamma}(t) - \\tilde{p}| = |(1-t)(\\tilde{q}_1 - \\tilde{p}) + t(\\tilde{q}_2 - \\tilde{p})| \\leq (1-t)|\\tilde{q}_1 - \\tilde{p}| + t|\\tilde{q}_2 - \\tilde{p}|  (1-t)r_* + tr_* = r_*\n$$\nSo, $|\\tilde{\\gamma}(t) - \\tilde{p}|  r_* = \\ell(\\Lambda)/4$.\n\nNow consider any non-zero lattice vector $\\lambda \\in \\Lambda \\setminus \\{0\\}$. We have $|\\lambda| \\geq \\ell(\\Lambda)$.\nUsing the reverse triangle inequality:\n$$\n|\\tilde{\\gamma}(t) - \\tilde{p} - \\lambda| \\geq ||\\lambda| - |\\tilde{\\gamma}(t) - \\tilde{p}|| \\geq |\\ell(\\Lambda) - |\\tilde{\\gamma}(t) - \\tilde{p}||\n$$\nSince $|\\tilde{\\gamma}(t) - \\tilde{p}|  \\ell(\\Lambda)/4$, we have:\n$$\n|\\tilde{\\gamma}(t) - \\tilde{p} - \\lambda|  \\ell(\\Lambda) - \\frac{\\ell(\\Lambda)}{4} = \\frac{3\\ell(\\Lambda)}{4}\n$$\nComparing the distances, we have $|\\tilde{\\gamma}(t) - \\tilde{p}|  \\ell(\\Lambda)/4$ and $|\\tilde{\\gamma}(t) - \\tilde{p} - \\lambda|  3\\ell(\\Lambda)/4$ for $\\lambda \\ne 0$. Clearly, the minimum distance is achieved when $\\lambda=0$.\nTherefore, $d(p, \\gamma(t)) = |\\tilde{\\gamma}(t) - \\tilde{p}|$.\nFrom our earlier calculation, we have $d(p, \\gamma(t))  r_*$.\nThis proves that every point on the unique minimizing geodesic $\\gamma$ lies within the open ball $B(p, r_*)$.\n\nThe argument relied on the condition $2r_*  \\ell(\\Lambda)/2$, which is $r_*  \\ell(\\Lambda)/4$. For any open ball of radius $r  \\ell(\\Lambda)/4$, the argument holds. The question asks for the largest radius $r_*(\\Lambda)$ of an open ball that is guaranteed to be geodesically convex. This corresponds to the supremum of radii for which our argument is valid. This supremum is $\\ell(\\Lambda)/4$.\n\nThe largest radius $r_*(\\Lambda)$ such that all open metric balls $B(p, r_*(\\Lambda))$ are guaranteed to be geodesically convex by this argument is $\\ell(\\Lambda)/4$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\ell(\\Lambda)}{4}}\n$$", "id": "3047396"}]}
