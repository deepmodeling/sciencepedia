When we move from a one-dimensional line to a three-dimensional grid, does the \"amount\" of infinity increase?

Successfully tackling this problem demonstrates the powerful and counter-intuitive idea that many seemingly \"larger\" infinite sets are, in fact, countable.", "problem": "Imagine a conceptual, infinite library constructed as a perfect three-dimensional grid. Every potential location for a book is identified by a unique point with integer coordinates $(x, y, z)$, where $x, y, \\text{ and } z$ are all elements of the set of integers, $\\mathbb{Z} = \\{..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...\\}$. The library is infinitely large, extending indefinitely along the positive and negative directions of the x, y, and z axes.\n\nThe head librarian proposes a grand project: to create a universal cataloging system by assigning a unique positive integer from the set $\\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$ to every single book location in this infinite grid. For the project to be considered feasible, two conditions must be met: every book location must be assigned exactly one positive integer, and no two different locations can be assigned the same integer.\n\nConsider the following claims about the feasibility of this cataloging project. Which one is the only correct statement?\n\nA. The project is theoretically possible. A systematic procedure can be defined to assign a unique positive integer to every location in the grid, ensuring that every location is eventually cataloged.\nB. The project is impossible. The set of locations in a three-dimensional infinite grid represents a \"higher order\" of infinity than the set of positive integers, so there are not enough integers to label all the locations.\nC. The project would be possible for a single infinite, two-dimensional plane of the library (e.g., all locations with $z=0$), but it becomes impossible for the full three-dimensional structure.\nD. The project is impossible because the set of all integers $\\mathbb{Z}$ is fundamentally larger than the set of positive integers $\\mathbb{N}$, as it includes negative numbers and zero, making it impossible to even label the points on a single axis.", "solution": "We are asked whether there exists a bijection between the set $\\mathbb{N}=\\{1,2,3,\\dots\\}$ and the set of integer lattice points $\\mathbb{Z}^{3}=\\mathbb{Z}\\times\\mathbb{Z}\\times\\mathbb{Z}$. The project is feasible exactly when $\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ is countably infinite, that is, when there exists a bijection $\\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$.\n\nFirst, we recall the definition: a set is countably infinite if there exists a bijection between it and $\\mathbb{N}$. We will establish the countability of $\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ by constructing an explicit enumeration.\n\nStep 1: Show $\\mathbb{Z}$ is countable by giving a bijection $f:\\mathbb{Z}\\to\\mathbb{N}$. Define\n$$\nf(n)=\\begin{cases}\n1, & n=0,\\\\\n2n, & n>0,\\\\\n-2n+1, & n<0.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis maps $0$ to $1$, positive integers $n$ to the even numbers $2,4,6,\\dots$, and negative integers $n$ to the odd numbers greater than $1$, namely $3,5,7,\\dots$. This mapping is injective because the three cases are disjoint in their images and strictly monotone within each case, and it is surjective onto $\\mathbb{N}$ because every positive integer is either $1$, an even number, or an odd number greater than $1$.

For each fixed $s$, the set $S_{s}$ is finite because there are only finitely many integer triples whose sum of absolute values equals $s$ (each coordinate is bounded in absolute value by $s$, and only finitely many sign patterns and compositions of $s$ among three nonnegative integers exist). The sets $S_{s}$ are pairwise disjoint, and\n$$\n\\mathbb{Z}^{3}=\\bigcup_{s\\in\\mathbb{N}_{0}} S_{s}.\n$$\nTo enumerate $\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$, fix a deterministic ordering within each $S_{s}$, for example lexicographic order on $(x,y,z)$ with $x,y,z$ ordered by the bijection from Step 1 or by the order $0,1,-1,2,-2,\\dots$. Then list all elements of $S_{0}$ in that order, followed by all elements of $S_{1}$, then $S_{2}$, and so on. Because each $S_{s}$ is finite and the union is disjoint, concatenating these finite lists yields a sequence that contains every element of $\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ exactly once. Therefore, there is a bijection $\\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$.\n\nConsequences for the options:\n- A is correct because we have exhibited a systematic enumeration procedure that induces a bijection $\\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$, so every location can be assigned a unique positive integer.\n- B is false because $\\mathbb{Z}^{3}$ is not a larger infinity than $\\mathbb{N}$; they have the same cardinality.\n- C is false because the argument above shows the entire three-dimensional grid is countable, just like any single plane $\\mathbb{Z}^{2}$.\n- D is false because $\\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\mathbb{N}$ have the same cardinality, as shown in Step 1.\n\nTherefore, the only correct statement is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1299985"}, {"introduction": "Having established that even a 3D grid of points is countable, we now turn our attention to the boundary where countability ends and the vastness of the uncountable begins.

Whether one defines $S$ by the existence of a no-$5$ expansion or by requiring all expansions to have no $5$, the difference between the resulting sets is at most countable, so the cardinality remains uncountable.

First, we will decompose the set $P$ into a union of simpler sets. Then, we will determine the cardinalities of these constituent sets and use the properties of cardinal arithmetic to find the cardinality of their union.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of all open intervals with rational endpoints.\n$$S = \\{ (a, b) \\mid a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}, a < b \\}$$\nFor each interval $I \\in S$, we can define a set $P_I$ of polynomials that satisfy the given conditions with respect to that specific interval $I$.\n$$P_I = \\{ p(x) \\in \\mathbb{R}[x] \\mid p(x) \\text{ is non-constant, has at least one real root, and all its real roots are in } I \\}$$\nThe set $P$ is the collection of all polynomials that belong to at least one of these sets $P_I$. Therefore, $P$ is the union of all sets $P_I$ for every $I$ in $S$.\n$$P = \\bigcup_{I \\in S} P_I$$\n\nFirst, let's determine the cardinality of the index set $S$. Each interval $(a, b)$ in $S$ is uniquely defined by its ordered pair of rational endpoints $(a, b)$. This means there is a one-to-one correspondence between the set $S$ and a subset of the Cartesian product $\\mathbb{Q} \\times \\mathbb{Q}$. The set of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ is countably infinite, with cardinality $|\\mathbb{Q}| = \\aleph_0$. The cardinality of the Cartesian product of two countably infinite sets is also countably infinite: $|\\mathbb{Q} \\times \\mathbb{Q}| = |\\mathbb{Q}| \\cdot |\\mathbb{Q}| = \\aleph_0 \\cdot \\aleph_0 = \\aleph_0$. The set $S$ is an infinite subset of this countable set (for example, the intervals $(0, 1/n)$ for $n=1, 2, 3, \\dots$ are all distinct elements of $S$). An infinite subset of a countable set must be countable. Thus, the cardinality of the set of intervals $S$ is $|S| = \\aleph_0$.\n\nNext, we need to find the cardinality of the sets $P_I$. Let's pick a specific interval, for example, $I_0 = (0, 1) \\in S$, and determine the cardinality of $P_{I_0}$.\nTo find a lower bound for $|P_{I_0}|$, consider the set of quadratic polynomials of the form $p(x) = (x-r_1)(x-r_2)$ where $r_1, r_2 \\in (0,1)$. These polynomials are non-constant and have all their real roots (namely $r_1$ and $r_2$) in the interval $I_0=(0,1)$. Thus, this collection of polynomials is a subset of $P_{I_0}$. Each distinct unordered pair of roots $\\{r_1, r_2\\}$ from $(0,1)$ defines a unique such polynomial. The set of such pairs corresponds to the set $(\\,(0,1) \\times (0,1)\\,)/\\sim$, where $\\sim$ is the equivalence relation $(r_1, r_2) \\sim (r_2, r_1)$. The cardinality of the interval $(0,1)$ is the cardinality of the continuum, $\\mathfrak{c}$. The cardinality of the Cartesian product $(0,1) \\times (0,1)$ is $\\mathfrak{c} \\cdot \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$. Since each polynomial corresponds to at most two ordered pairs of roots, the cardinality of this set of polynomials is $\\mathfrak{c}$. Since this set is a subset of $P_{I_0}$, we must have $|P_{I_0}| \\ge \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nFor an upper bound, we note that $P_{I_0}$ is a subset of $\\mathbb{R}[x]$, the set of all polynomials with real coefficients. Any polynomial $p(x) = a_n x^n + \\dots + a_1 x + a_0$ is uniquely determined by its finite sequence of coefficients $(a_0, a_1, \\dots, a_n) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. The set of all polynomials is the countable union of the sets of polynomials of fixed degree $n$: $\\mathbb{R}[x] = \\bigcup_{n=0}^{\\infty} P'_n$, where $P'_n$ is the set of polynomials of degree $n$. The cardinality of $P'_n$ is $|\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}| = \\mathfrak{c}$. Therefore, the cardinality of $\\mathbb{R}[x]$ is $|\\mathbb{R}[x]| = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} |P'_n| = \\aleph_0 \\cdot \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$. Since $P_{I_0} \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}[x]$, we have $|P_{I_0}| \\le |\\mathbb{R}[x]| = \\mathfrak{c}$.\n\nCombining our lower and upper bounds, $\\mathfrak{c} \\le |P_{I_0}| \\le \\mathfrak{c}$, we conclude by the Cantor-Schröder-Bernstein theorem that $|P_{I_0}| = \\mathfrak{c}$. The same argument can be applied to any interval $I \\in S$, since any open interval $(a,b)$ can be bijectively mapped to $(0,1)$, showing that $|P_I| = \\mathfrak{c}$ for all $I \\in S$.\n\nFinally, we calculate the cardinality of $P = \\bigcup_{I \\in S} P_I$. This is a union of $|S| = \\aleph_0$ sets, each of which has cardinality $\\mathfrak{c}$. The cardinality of such a union is given by the cardinal product:\n$$|P| = |S| \\cdot \\sup_{I \\in S} |P_I| = \\aleph_0 \\cdot \\mathfrak{c}$$\nA standard theorem in cardinal arithmetic states that $\\aleph_0 \\cdot \\mathfrak{c} = \\mathfrak{c}$.\nTherefore, the cardinality of the set $P$ is $\\mathfrak{c}$, the cardinality of the continuum.
