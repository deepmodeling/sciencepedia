The tasks are to prove one semantic consequence, disprove another by constructing a countermodel, and find the minimal cardinality of such a countermodel's domain.\n\nFirst, we will justify that $\\Gamma \\models \\varphi$.\nBy definition, the semantic consequence $\\Gamma \\models \\varphi$ holds if and only if for every structure $\\mathcal{M}$, if $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\Gamma$, then $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\varphi$.\nLet $\\mathcal{M}$ be an arbitrary structure with a non-empty domain $D$. Let $Q^\\mathcal{M} \\subseteq D$ and $R^\\mathcal{M} \\subseteq D$ be the interpretations of the unary predicate symbols $Q$ and $R$, respectively, in the structure $\\mathcal{M}$.\nAssume that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\Gamma$. This means $\\mathcal{M}$ satisfies all sentences in $\\Gamma$:\n$1$. $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\forall x\\,\\big(Q(x) \\rightarrow R(x)\\big)$. According to the Tarskian semantics, this means that for every element $a \\in D$, the statement \"$a \\in Q^\\mathcal{M}$ implies $a \\in R^\\mathcal{M}$\" is true. This is equivalent to the set-theoretic condition $Q^\\mathcal{M} \\subseteq R^\\mathcal{M}$.\n$2$. $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\exists x\\,Q(x)$. Semantically, this means there exists at least one element $c \\in D$ such that $c \\in Q^\\mathcal{M}$. Consequently, the set $Q^\\mathcal{M}$ must be non-empty, i.e., $Q^\\mathcal{M} \\neq \\emptyset$.\nOur goal is to show that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\varphi$, which is $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\exists x\\,R(x)$. This holds if and only if there exists some element $d \\in D$ such that $d \\in R^\\mathcal{M}$. In other words, we must show that $R^\\mathcal{M}$ is non-empty.\nFrom premise ($2$), we know there exists an element $c \\in D$ such that $c \\in Q^\\mathcal{M}$.\nFrom premise ($1$), the implication $a \\in Q^\\mathcal{M} \\rightarrow a \\in R^\\mathcal{M}$ holds for all $a \\in D$. In particular, it holds for the element $c$.\nSince $c \\in Q^\\mathcal{M}$, it follows by logical deduction (modus ponens) that $c \\in R^\\mathcal{M}$.\nThe existence of an element $c$ in $R^\\mathcal{M}$ proves that $R^\\mathcal{M}$ is non-empty.\nTherefore, $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\exists x\\,R(x)$, which means $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\varphi$.\nSince our choice of $\\mathcal{M}$ was an arbitrary model of $\\Gamma$, we have demonstrated that any model of $\\Gamma$ is also a model of $\\varphi$. We conclude that $\\Gamma \\models \\varphi$.\n\nSecond, we will construct a countermodel to show that $\\Gamma \\not\\models \\psi$.\nTo show $\\Gamma \\not\\models \\psi$, we need to find a single structure $\\mathcal{M}$ such that $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\Gamma$ and $\\mathcal{M} \\not\\models \\psi$. Let's specify the properties of such a structure $\\mathcal{M}$ with domain $D$ and interpretations $Q^\\mathcal{M}$ and $R^\\mathcal{M}$:\n- $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\Gamma$:\n    - $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\forall x\\,\\big(Q(x) \\rightarrow R(x)\\big) \\implies Q^\\mathcal{M} \\subseteq R^\\mathcal{M}$.\n    - $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\exists x\\,Q(x) \\implies Q^\\mathcal{M} \\neq \\emptyset$.\n- $\\mathcal{M} \\not\\models \\psi$:\n    - $\\mathcal{M} \\not\\models \\forall x\\,R(x)$. This means there exists at least one element $b \\in D$ such that $b \\notin R^\\mathcal{M}$. This is equivalent to $R^\\mathcal{M}$ being a proper subset of $D$.\n\nLet us attempt to construct such a model with the smallest possible domain. A domain of size $1$ would not work, as if $D = \\{a\\}$, then $Q^\\mathcal{M} \\neq \\emptyset$ requires $Q^\\mathcal{M} = \\{a\\}$. Then $Q^\\mathcal{M} \\subseteq R^\\mathcal{M}$ requires $R^\\mathcal{M} = \\{a\\}$. But this means $R^\\mathcal{M} = D$, which implies $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\forall x\\,R(x)$, contradicting the requirement that $\\mathcal{M} \\not\\models \\psi$.\nLet's try a domain of size $2$. Let the domain be $D = \\{c_1, c_2\\}$.\nWe define the structure $\\mathcal{M}$ as follows:\n- Domain $D = \\{c_1, c_2\\}$.\n- Interpretation of $Q$: $Q^\\mathcal{M} = \\{c_1\\}$.\n- Interpretation of $R$: $R^\\mathcal{M} = \\{c_1\\}$.\n\nNow, we verify that this structure $\\mathcal{M}$ is a countermodel:\n- Does $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\Gamma$?\n    - To check $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\forall x\\,\\big(Q(x) \\rightarrow R(x)\\big)$, we check if $Q^\\mathcal{M} \\subseteq R^\\mathcal{M}$. Since $\\{c_1\\} \\subseteq \\{c_1\\}$, this is true.\n    - To check $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\exists x\\,Q(x)$, we check if $Q^\\mathcal{M} \\neq \\emptyset$. Since $Q^\\mathcal{M}=\\{c_1\\}$, it is non-empty. This is true.\n    - Since both sentences in $\\Gamma$ are satisfied, $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\Gamma$.\n- Does $\\mathcal{M} \\not\\models \\psi$?\n    - To check $\\mathcal{M} \\not\\models \\forall x\\,R(x)$, we must find an element in $D$ that is not in $R^\\mathcal{M}$. Consider the element $c_2 \\in D$. The interpretation $R^\\mathcal{M}$ is $\\{c_1\\}$, and $c_2 \\notin \\{c_1\\}$. Thus, the universal statement $\\forall x\\,R(x)$ is false in $\\mathcal{M}$.\n    - Therefore, $\\mathcal{M} \\not\\models \\psi$.\nSince we have found a structure $\\mathcal{M}$ where $\\Gamma$ is true and $\\psi$ is false, we have successfully shown that $\\Gamma \\not\\models \\psi$.\n\nThird, we will determine the minimal possible finite cardinality of the domain for such a countermodel.\nLet $\\mathcal{M}$ be any countermodel with a finite domain $D$, which falsifies $\\psi$ while satisfying $\\Gamma$. The following conditions must be met for the interpretations $Q^\\mathcal{M}$ and $R^\\mathcal{M}$:\n$1$. From $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\exists x\\,Q(x)$, we know $Q^\\mathcal{M} \\neq \\emptyset$. This implies there exists at least one element, let's call it $a$, such that $a \\in Q^\\mathcal{M}$.\n$2$. From $\\mathcal{M} \\models \\forall x\\,\\big(Q(x) \\rightarrow R(x)\\big)$, we have $Q^\\mathcal{M} \\subseteq R^\\mathcal{M}$. Since $a \\in Q^\\mathcal{M}$ from point ($1$), it must also be that $a \\in R^\\mathcal{M}$.\n$3$. From $\\mathcal{M} \\not\\models \\forall x\\,R(x)$, we know there is some element in the domain that is not in the interpretation of $R$. Let this element be $b$. So, $b \\in D$ and $b \\notin R^\\mathcal{M}$.\nNow, compare the elements $a$ and $b$. We have $a \\in R^\\mathcal{M}$ and $b \\notin R^\\mathcal{M}$. This immediately implies that $a$ and $b$ cannot be the same element, so $a \\neq b$.\nSince the domain $D$ must contain at least these two distinct elements $a$ and $b$, the cardinality of $D$ must be at least $2$. So, $|D| \\geq 2$.\nIn the second part of this solution, we explicitly constructed a countermodel with a domain of cardinality $2$. This demonstrates that the minimum possible cardinality of $2$ is achievable.\nTherefore, the minimal possible finite cardinality of the domain of a countermodel is $2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2}\n$$", "id": "3057860"}, {"introduction": "Moving from semantics to the symbolic world of syntax, we can define a theory as a set of formulas closed under formal proof, or derivability ($\\vdash$).

Such a valuation is called a model of $\\Gamma$.\n\nIn this problem, $\\Gamma = \\{p \\leftrightarrow q\\}$. The language $L$ has two propositional variables, $p$ and $q$, giving rise to $2^2 = 4$ possible truth valuations. A valuation $v$ is a model of $\\Gamma$ if $v(p \\leftrightarrow q) = \\text{True}$.

This is equivalent to saying that for every model $v$ of $\\Gamma$, $v(\\varphi) = v(\\psi)$.\n\nFrom part 2), the models of $\\Gamma = \\{p \\leftrightarrow q\\}$ are $v_1$ and $v_4$. Thus, two formulas $\\varphi$ and $\\psi$ are equivalent modulo $\\Gamma$ if and only if they have the same truth values under both of these models:\n$$ \\varphi \\equiv_{\\Gamma} \\psi \\iff (v_1(\\varphi) = v_1(\\psi) \\text{ and } v_4(\\varphi) = v_4(\\psi)) $$\nThis means that an equivalence class $[\\varphi]_{\\equiv_{\\Gamma}}$ is uniquely determined by the pair of truth values $(v_1(\\varphi), v_4(\\varphi))$. The truth value of a formula under a given valuation can be either True ($T$) or False ($F$). Therefore, there are at most $2 \\times 2 = 4$ possible pairs of truth values, and thus at most $4$ distinct equivalence classes. These possible behaviors are $(T,T)$, $(T,F)$, $(F,T)$, and $(F,F)$.\n\nTo show that there are exactly $4$ classes, we must demonstrate that each of these four behaviors is realized by at least one formula in the language $L$.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item **Behavior $(T,T)$**: We need a formula $\\varphi$ such that $v_1(\\varphi)=T$ and $v_4(\\varphi)=T$.

This involves proving two properties: consistency and maximality.\n\n1.  **$M$ is consistent.**\n    A set of formulas is inconsistent if a contradiction can be derived from it. We prove the consistency of $M$ by contradiction. Assume $M$ is inconsistent. By the compactness theorem for propositional logic (which itself is a consequence of the finite nature of proofs), there must be a finite subset $\\Sigma \\subseteq M$ that is inconsistent. Since $\\Sigma$ is finite and $M$ is the union of a nested sequence of sets $\\Delta_{0} \\subseteq \\Delta_{1} \\subseteq \\Delta_{2} \\subseteq \\ldots$, there must exist some integer $k$ such that $\\Sigma \\subseteq \\Delta_{k}$. But if $\\Sigma \\subseteq \\Delta_{k}$ and $\\Sigma$ is inconsistent, then $\\Delta_{k}$ must also be inconsistent. This contradicts the construction of the sequence $(\\Delta_{n})_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$, which is designed to ensure that every $\\Delta_{n}$ is consistent. We can show this by induction.\n    *   **Base case:** $\\Delta_{0} = \\Gamma$ is given as consistent.\n    *   **Inductive step:** Assume $\\Delta_{k-1}$ is consistent for $k \\ge 1$. We define $\\Delta_{k}$ by considering the formula $\\varphi_{k}$.\n        *   If $\\Delta_{k-1} \\cup \\{\\varphi_k\\}$ is consistent, we set $\\Delta_{k} = \\Delta_{k-1} \\cup \\{\\varphi_k\\}$, which is consistent by definition.\n        *   If $\\Delta_{k-1} \\cup \\{\\varphi_k\\}$ is inconsistent, then from the properties of classical logic and the deduction theorem, we have $\\Delta_{k-1} \\vdash \\neg \\varphi_k$. In this case, we set $\\Delta_{k} = \\Delta_{k-1} \\cup \\{\\neg \\varphi_k\\}$. If this set were also inconsistent, we would have $\\Delta_{k-1} \\vdash \\neg \\neg \\varphi_k$, which simplifies to $\\Delta_{k-1} \\vdash \\varphi_k$. Having both $\\Delta_{k-1} \\vdash \\varphi_k$ and $\\Delta_{k-1} \\vdash \\neg \\varphi_k$ implies that $\\Delta_{k-1}$ is inconsistent, which contradicts our inductive hypothesis. Therefore, at least one of the choices for $\\Delta_k$ preserves consistency, and our construction explicitly chooses a consistent set.\n    Since every $\\Delta_{k}$ is consistent, no finite subset of $M$ can be inconsistent. Thus, $M$ is consistent.\n\n2.  **$M$ is maximal.**\n    A consistent set $S$ is maximal if for any formula $\\psi$ not in $S$, the set $S \\cup \\{\\psi\\}$ is inconsistent. Let $\\psi$ be an arbitrary formula in the language. Since $(\\varphi_{1}, \\varphi_{2}, \\ldots)$ is an enumeration of all formulas, there is an index $k$ such that $\\psi = \\varphi_{k}$. Now, consider the $k$-th step of our construction, forming $\\Delta_{k}$ from $\\Delta_{k-1}$ by considering $\\varphi_k$.\n    *   If $\\Delta_{k-1} \\cup \\{\\varphi_k\\}$ was consistent, we set $\\Delta_{k} = \\Delta_{k-1} \\cup \\{\\varphi_k\\}$, so $\\varphi_k \\in \\Delta_k \\subseteq M$.\n    *   If $\\Delta_{k-1} \\cup \\{\\varphi_k\\}$ was inconsistent, we set $\\Delta_k = \\Delta_{k-1} \\cup \\{\\neg \\varphi_k\\}$, so $\\neg \\varphi_k \\in \\Delta_k \\subseteq M$.\n    This shows that for any formula $\\psi$, either $\\psi \\in M$ or $\\neg \\psi \\in M$.\n    Now, let's suppose $\\psi \\notin M$. From the above, this implies that $\\neg \\psi \\in M$. If we then form the set $M \\cup \\{\\psi\\}$, this set contains both $\\psi$ and $\\neg \\psi$. Any set containing a formula and its negation is inconsistent. Therefore, for any $\\psi \\notin M$, $M \\cup \\{\\psi\\}$ is inconsistent. This proves that $M$ is a maximal consistent set.\n\nSecond, we explain the role of the class of all maximal consistent sets in the canonical model construction, which is the cornerstone of the proof of the completeness theorem for propositional logic.\nThe canonical model is defined as a pair $\\mathcal{M} = (W, V)$, where:\n*   $W$ is the set of all maximal consistent sets of formulas. Each such set $w \\in W$ is treated as a \"possible world\".\n*   $V$ is a valuation function. For any world $w \\in W$ and any propositional variable $p$, the valuation is defined as $V(w, p) = 1$ if and only if $p \\in w$. The valuation is extended to compound formulas according to the standard truth-tables for the connectives $\\neg$, $\\land$, $\\to$.\n\nThe central result that connects this structure to provability is the **Truth Lemma**, which states that for any formula $\\varphi$ and any world $w \\in W$, the valuation of $\\varphi$ in that world matches its membership in the set $w$:\n$$V(w, \\varphi) = 1 \\iff \\varphi \\in w$$\nThis is proven by induction on the complexity of the formula $\\varphi$. The base case for propositional variables holds by the definition of $V$. The inductive steps for the connectives rely on the properties of maximal consistent sets. For instance, for negation: $V(w, \\neg \\psi) = 1 \\Leftrightarrow V(w, \\psi) = 0$. By the induction hypothesis, this is equivalent to $\\psi \\notin w$. Since $w$ is a maximal consistent set, $\\psi \\notin w \\Leftrightarrow \\neg \\psi \\in w$. The steps for $\\land$ and $\\to$ rely on the fact that maximal consistent sets are deductively closed (i.e., if $S \\subseteq w$ and $S \\vdash \\chi$, then $\\chi \\in w$). For example, $(\\psi \\land \\chi) \\in w \\Leftrightarrow \\psi \\in w$ and $\\chi \\in w$.\n\nThe significance of the canonical model and the Truth Lemma is profound: it establishes that any consistent set of formulas $\\Gamma$ is satisfiable. Starting with a consistent $\\Gamma$, one can extend it (using the Lindenbaum construction) to a maximal consistent set $M$. This set $M$ is a world in the canonical model. For any formula $\\varphi \\in \\Gamma$, we also have $\\varphi \\in M$. By the Truth Lemma, $V(M, \\varphi) = 1$. This means that the world $M$ is a model for $\\Gamma$, proving that $\\Gamma$ is satisfiable. This directly leads to the completeness theorem: if a formula $\\varphi$ is a semantic consequence of a set $\\Gamma$ (i.e., $\\Gamma \\models \\varphi$), then it is a syntactic consequence (i.e., $\\Gamma \\vdash \\varphi$).\n\nThird, we compute the value $V_{M}\\big(((p \\to q) \\land (q \\to r)) \\to (p \\to r)\\big)$.\nWe are given that $\\Gamma = \\{p \\to q, q \\to r, p\\} \\subseteq M$. The set $M$ is a maximal consistent set, and it is therefore deductively closed. This means that any formula that can be proven from the formulas in $M$ must also be in $M$.\nLet's analyze the contents of $M$:\n1.  From $\\Gamma$, we have $p \\in M$ and $(p \\to q) \\in M$. Since $M$ is deductively closed under modus ponens, we can infer that $q \\in M$.\n2.  Now we have $q \\in M$ and, from $\\Gamma$, $(q \\to r) \\in M$. Again, by modus ponens, we infer that $r \\in M$.\nSo, we have established that $\\{p, q, r\\} \\subseteq M$.\n\nAccording to the Truth Lemma (or, equivalently, the definition of the valuation $V_M$ in the canonical model), for any atomic proposition $x$, $V_M(x) = 1$ if $x \\in M$ and $V_M(x) = 0$ if $x \\notin M$.\nThus, we have:\n*   $V_M(p) = 1$ because $p \\in M$.\n*   $V_M(q) = 1$ because $q \\in M$.\n*   $V_M(r) = 1$ because $r \\in M$.\n\nNow we can compute the truth-value of the full formula step-by-step using the truth-functional definitions of the connectives:\n*   $V_M(p \\to q) = (V_M(p) \\to V_M(q)) = (1 \\to 1) = 1$.\n*   $V_M(q \\to r) = (V_M(q) \\to V_M(r)) = (1 \\to 1) = 1$.\n*   $V_M((p \\to q) \\land (q \\to r)) = (V_M(p \\to q) \\land V_M(q \\to r)) = (1 \\land 1) = 1$.\n*   $V_M(p \\to r) = (V_M(p) \\to V_M(r)) = (1 \\to 1) = 1$.\n\nFinally, we compute the value of the main implication:\n$$V_{M}\\big(((p \\to q) \\land (q \\to r)) \\to (p \\to r)\\big) = \\big(V_M((p \\to q) \\land (q \\to r)) \\to V_M(p \\to r)\\big) = (1 \\to 1) = 1$$\n\nAlternatively, we can note that the formula $\\Phi = ((p \\to q) \\land (q \\to r)) \\to (p \\to r)$ is a tautology in classical propositional logic (it is the law of hypothetical syllogism). In any sound and complete Hilbert-style system, all tautologies are theorems, meaning $\\vdash \\Phi$. Since $M$ is deductively closed, and theorems are provable from the empty set, any theorem must be a member of any maximal consistent set. Therefore, $\\Phi \\in M$. By the Truth Lemma, if $\\Phi \\in M$, then $V_M(\\Phi) = 1$. Both methods yield the same result.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1} $$", "id": "3057829"}]}
