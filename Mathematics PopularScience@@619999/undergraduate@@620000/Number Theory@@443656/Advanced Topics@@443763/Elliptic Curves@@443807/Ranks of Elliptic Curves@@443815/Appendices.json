It is self-contained, mathematically sound, and well-posed within the established framework of number theory concerning elliptic curves. The tasks are specific and admit unique, verifiable solutions based on standard definitions and formulas.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part analysis of the elliptic curve $E$ defined over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$ by the equation $y^{2}=x^{3}-x$.\n\nPart 1: Computation of the discriminant and verification of nonsingularity.\n\nThe given equation for the elliptic curve $E$ is $y^{2}=x^{3}-x$. This is in the short Weierstrass form $y^{2}=x^{3}+ax+b$. By comparing the coefficients of the given equation with the general form, we identify the parameters $a$ and $b$ for this specific curve:\n$$a = -1$$\n$$b = 0$$\n\nThe discriminant of an elliptic curve in short Weierstrass form is given by the formula:\n$$\\Delta = -16(4a^{3} + 27b^{2})$$\n\nSubstituting the values $a=-1$ and $b=0$ for the curve $E$, we compute its discriminant, denoted $\\Delta(E)$:\n$$\\Delta(E) = -16(4(-1)^{3} + 27(0)^{2})$$\n$$\\Delta(E) = -16(4(-1) + 27(0))$$\n$$\\Delta(E) = -16(-4 + 0)$$\n$$\\Delta(E) = -16(-4)$$\n$$\\Delta(E) = 64$$\n\nAn elliptic curve defined by a Weierstrass equation is nonsingular if and only if its discriminant is non-zero. Since the discriminant of $E$ is $\\Delta(E) = 64$, which is not equal to $0$, the curve $E$ is nonsingular over any field whose characteristic does not divide $2\\Delta$. As we are working over $\\mathbb{Q}$, which has characteristic $0$, the condition $\\Delta(E) \\neq 0$ is sufficient to confirm that $E$ is a nonsingular curve, and thus a valid elliptic curve.\n\nPart 2: Identification of the identity element in projective coordinates.\n\nAn elliptic curve is formally defined as a nonsingular cubic curve in the projective plane $\\mathbb{P}^{2}$ with a specified rational point. The affine equation $y^{2}=x^{3}-x$ describes the points of the curve in the affine plane. To find all points, including those \"at infinity,\" we must work in projective coordinates.\n\nWe homogenize the affine equation by introducing a third coordinate $Z$ and setting $x = X/Z$ and $y = Y/Z$. Substituting these into the equation of $E$ gives:\n$$\\left(\\frac{Y}{Z}\\right)^{2} = \\left(\\frac{X}{Z}\\right)^{3} - \\frac{X}{Z}$$\n$$\\frac{Y^{2}}{Z^{2}} = \\frac{X^{3}}{Z^{3}} - \\frac{X}{Z}$$\nTo clear the denominators, we multiply the entire equation by $Z^{3}$, which is the lowest common multiple of the denominators' degrees:\n$$Z^{3}\\left(\\frac{Y^{2}}{Z^{2}}\\right) = Z^{3}\\left(\\frac{X^{3}}{Z^{3}}\\right) - Z^{3}\\left(\\frac{X}{Z}\\right)$$\n$$Y^{2}Z = X^{3} - XZ^{2}$$\nThis is the equation for $E$ in homogeneous projective coordinates $[X:Y:Z]$. The affine points $(x,y)$ of the original curve correspond to the projective points $[x:y:1]$.\n\nThe \"points at infinity\" are those for which $Z=0$. Substituting $Z=0$ into the homogeneous equation:\n$$Y^{2}(0) = X^{3} - X(0)^{2}$$\n$$0 = X^{3}$$\nThis implies that $X=0$. Thus, any point at infinity on the curve $E$ must have coordinates of the form $[0:Y:0]$. In projective coordinates, at least one coordinate must be non-zero. Therefore, we must have $Y \\neq 0$.\n\nAll points $[0:Y:0]$ with $Y \\neq 0$ are equivalent, as they can be scaled by a non-zero constant. For example, scaling by $1/Y$ gives:\n$$[0:Y:0] \\sim \\left[0 \\cdot \\frac{1}{Y} : Y \\cdot \\frac{1}{Y} : 0 \\cdot \\frac{1}{Y}\\right] = [0:1:0]$$\nThis shows that there is a single, unique point at infinity on the curve $E$. By convention and for the geometric construction of the group law, this unique point at infinity is designated as the identity element for the group of rational points $E(\\mathbb{Q})$. We denote this point as $P_{0}$.\n\nTherefore, the identity element is $P_{0} = [0:1:0]$.\n\nThe two requested quantities are the discriminant $\\Delta(E) = 64$ and the identity point $P_{0} = [0:1:0]$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 64 & [0:1:0] \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3089254"}, {"introduction": "Determining the rank of an elliptic curve is a notoriously difficult problem, but a powerful technique known as descent provides a systematic way to compute an upper bound.

The two-torsion points $E[2]$ are the points of order dividing two. These are the point at infinity, $\\mathcal{O}$, and the points with $y$-coordinate $0$.\nSetting $y=0$, we get $x(x-1)(x+1)=0$, which yields the rational roots $x=0$, $x=1$, and $x=-1$.\nThe rational two-torsion points are:\n$T_1 = (0,0)$, $T_2 = (1,0)$, and $T_3 = (-1,0)$.\nAlong with $\\mathcal{O}$, these four points form the group $E(\\mathbb{Q})[2] \\cong (\\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z})^2$. Let's denote the $x$-coordinates as $e_1=0$, $e_2=1$, and $e_3=-1$.\n\nThe two-descent is mediated by the Kummer map $\\delta: E(\\mathbb{Q}) \\to (\\mathbb{Q}^\\times/(\\mathbb{Q}^\\times)^2)^2$, defined (up to a choice of basis for $E[2]$) by:\nFor a point $P=(x,y) \\in E(\\mathbb{Q})$ where $y \\ne 0$:\n$$ \\delta(P) = (x-e_1, x-e_2) \\pmod{(\\mathbb{Q}^\\times)^2} = (x, x-1) \\pmod{(\\mathbb{Q}^\\times)^2} $$\nThe map is extended to the torsion points.

Let $d_3$ be defined by the relation $d_3 \\equiv d_1 d_2 \\pmod{(\\mathbb{Q}^\\times)^2}$. The existence of a point $(x,y)$ on $E$ corresponding to $(d_1, d_2, d_3)$ implies the existence of $u,v,w \\in \\mathbb{Q}^\\times$ such that:\n$$ x-e_1 = d_1 u^2 \\implies x = d_1 u^2 $$\n$$ x-e_2 = d_2 v^2 \\implies x-1 = d_2 v^2 $$\n$$ x-e_3 = d_3 w^2 \\implies x+1 = d_1d_2 w^2 $$\nFor a given pair of square-free integers $(d_1, d_2)$, we must check if this system of equations has a solution in $\\mathbb{Q}_v$ for all places $v$.\n\nThe discriminant of $E$ is $\\Delta = -16(4a^3 + 27b^2) = -16(4(-1)^3 + 27(0)^2) = 64 = 2^6$. A standard result states that we only need to check for local solubility at the places of bad reduction and at $v=\\infty$. The only prime of bad reduction is $p=2$. Thus, we only need to check for solutions in $\\mathbb{R}$ (for $v=\\infty$) and $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ (for $v=2$).\n\nFurthermore, the square-free integer representatives for $d_1$ and $d_2$ can only have prime factors that divide the discriminant $\\Delta$. In this case, the only prime factor is $2$. Thus, we only need to consider $d_1, d_2 \\in \\{\\pm 1, \\pm 2\\}$. This gives $4 \\times 4 = 16$ candidate pairs $(d_1, d_2)$ to test.\n\n**Step 3: Local Solubility Analysis**\n\nWe test the $16$ pairs for local solubility. A pair $(d_1, d_2)$ corresponds to an element of the Selmer group if there exists an $x \\in \\mathbb{Q}_v$ such that $x/d_1$, $(x-1)/d_2$, and $(x+1)/(d_1 d_2)$ are all squares in $\\mathbb{Q}_v$ for $v=\\infty, 2$.\n\n**Analysis over $\\mathbb{R}$ ($v=\\infty$)**:\nA number is a square in $\\mathbb{R}$ if it is non-negative. We need to find $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that:\n$$ d_1 x \\ge 0, \\quad d_2 (x-1) \\ge 0, \\quad d_1 d_2 (x+1) \\ge 0 $$\n- If $d_1>0, d_2<0$: $x \\ge 0$ and $x-1 \\le 0 \\implies 0 \\le x \\le 1$. The third condition is $d_1 d_2 (x+1)  0$, which implies $x+1  0$ or $x-1$. This is a contradiction. All four pairs $(1,-1), (1,-2), (2,-1), (2,-2)$ are eliminated.\n- If $d_10, d_20$: $x \\le 0$ and $x-1 \\ge 0 \\implies x \\ge 1$. This is a contradiction. All four pairs $(-1,1), (-1,2), (-2,1), (-2,2)$ are eliminated.\n\nThis leaves $16-8=8$ pairs surviving the test at $v=\\infty$:\n- $d_10, d_20$: $(1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)$\n- $d_10, d_20$: $(-1,-1), (-1,-2), (-2,-1), (-2,-2)$\n\n**Analysis over $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ ($v=2$)**:\nA number $q \\in \\mathbb{Q}_2$ is a square if and only if its 2-adic valuation $v_2(q)$ is an even integer and its unit part, $q/2^{v_2(q)}$, is congruent to $1$ modulo $8$.\n\nWe test the $8$ surviving pairs.\n1.  **$(1,1)$**: $d_1=1, d_2=1, d_3=1$. Requires $x, x-1, x+1$ to be squares. This is the trivial element $\\delta(\\mathcal{O})$ and must pass. Indeed, choosing $x=1$ does not work because $x-1=0$, which is a square, but $x+1=2$ is not a square in $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. However, we are looking for solvability in $\\mathbb{Q}_v$. The trivial point $\\mathcal{O}$ contributes $(1,1)$. So it passes.\n2.  **$(1,2)$**: $d_1=1, d_2=2, d_3=2$. Requires $x, (x-1)/2, (x+1)/2$ to be squares. This is $\\delta(1,0)$. Let $x=1$. Then $x=1^2$, $(x-1)/2=0=0^2$, and $(x+1)/2=1=1^2$. All are squares. This corresponds to the rational point $(1,0)$ on $E$. It passes.\n3.  **$(-1,-1)$**: $d_1=-1, d_2=-1, d_3=1$. Requires $-x, -(x-1), x+1$ to be squares. This is $\\delta(0,0)$. Let $x=0$. Then $-x=0$, $-(x-1)=1$, $x+1=1$. All are squares. It passes.\n4.  **$(-1,-2)$**: $d_1=-1, d_2=-2, d_3=2$. Requires $-x, -(x-1)/2, (x+1)/2$ to be squares. This is $\\delta(-1,0)$. Let $x=-1$. Then $-x=1$, $-(x-1)/2=1$, $(x+1)/2=0$. All are squares. It passes.\n\nNow we check the remaining four pairs.\n5.  **$(2,1)$**: $d_1=2, d_2=1, d_3=2$. Requires $x/2, x-1, (x+1)/2$ to be squares. Let $x=2u^2, x-1=v^2, (x+1)/2=w^2$. Substituting $x$: $2u^2-1=v^2$ and $(2u^2+1)/2=w^2 \\implies 2u^2+1=2w^2$. We need to find a solution $(u,v,w)$ in $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. From $2w^2-2u^2=1$, we have $2(w-u)(w+u)=1$, which implies $v_2(2(w-u)(w+u))=v_2(1)=0$. But $v_2(2(w-u)(w+u)) \\ge 1$. This is a contradiction. Thus, $(2,1)$ fails the $\\mathbb{Q}_2$ test.\n6.  **$(2,2)$**: $d_1=2, d_2=2, d_3=1$. Requires $x/2, (x-1)/2, x+1$ to be squares. Let $x=2u^2, x-1=2v^2, x+1=w^2$. From the first two, $2u^2-1=2v^2 \\implies 2(u^2-v^2)=1 \\implies u^2-v^2=1/2$. This has no solution in $\\mathbb{Q}_2$. To see this, let $u=a/c$ and $v=b/c$. Then $a^2-b^2=c^2/2$. $v_2(a^2-b^2)$ must be odd. But for any integers $a,b$, $v_2(a^2-b^2)$ is either $v_2(a-b)+v_2(a+b)$, which is even if $v_2(a)\\neq v_2(b)$, or $\\ge 3$ if $a,b$ are units with $a\\equiv b \\pmod 2$. There is no case where the valuation is odd. Thus, $(2,2)$ fails.\n7.  **$(-2,-1)$**: $d_1=-2, d_2=-1, d_3=2$. Requires $-x/2, 1-x, (x+1)/2$ to be squares. Let $x=-2u^2$. This gives $1+2u^2=v^2$ and $1-2u^2=2w^2$. From $v^2-2u^2=1$, any solution in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ requires $u$ to be even (if $u$ were a unit, $v^2 \\equiv 1+2=3 \\pmod 8$, impossible). So $u=2k$. Then $v$ is a unit. Substituting into the second eq: $1-2(4k^2) = 1-8k^2 = 2w^2$. The LHS is a unit $\\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$. For the RHS to be a unit, $w$ must be a unit, so $2w^2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 8$. $1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 8$ is a contradiction. Thus, $(-2,-1)$ fails.\n8.  **$(-2,-2)$**: $d_1=-2, d_2=-2, d_3=1$. Requires $-x/2, (1-x)/2, x+1$ to be squares. Let $x=-2u^2$. This gives $(1+2u^2)/2=v^2 \\implies 1+2u^2=2v^2$ and $1-2u^2=w^2$. From $w^2+2u^2=1$, any solution in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ must have $u$ even, $w$ a unit. So $u=2k$. Substitute into first eq: $1+8k^2=2v^2$. LHS is a unit $\\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$. RHS is $2v^2$. As before, $1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod 8$ is a contradiction if $v$ is a unit, and $1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod 8$ is a contradiction if $v$ is even. Thus, $(-2,-2)$ fails.\n\n**Conclusion: The Selmer Group**\n\nThe pairs $(d_1, d_2)$ that survive all local conditions are:\n$$ (1,1), \\quad (1,2), \\quad (-1,-1), \\quad (-1,-2) $$\nThese four pairs constitute the second Selmer group $\\mathrm{Sel}^{(2)}(E/\\mathbb{Q})$.

To verify this property for a given integer $d$, we can implement a trial division algorithm. We first handle the trivial case where $|d|=1$, which is squarefree.

If $d$ is divisible by $i^2$ for any such $i$, then $d$ is not squarefree. The algorithm is as follows:\n- If $d=0$, it is not a valid input as per the problem statement ($d \\neq 0$).\n- Let $n = |d|$. If $n=1$, $d$ is squarefree.\n- Check if $n$ is divisible by $4$ (the square of $2$). If so, $d$ is not squarefree.\n- Iterate through odd integers $i$ starting from $3$ up to $\\lfloor\\sqrt{n}\\rfloor$. For each $i$, if $n$ is divisible by $i^2$, then $d$ is not squarefree.\n- If the loops complete without finding a square factor, $d$ is squarefree.\n\n### Step 2: Verification that $P$ is on $E^{(d)}$\nGiven the point $P=(x,y)$ with $x, y \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ and the curve equation $E^{(d)}: y^2 = x^3 - d^2 x$, we must verify this equality with exact rational arithmetic. We substitute the coordinates of $P$ into the equation and check if the left-hand side, $y^2$, is exactly equal to the right-hand side, $x^3 - d^2 x$.\n\n### Step 3: Verification that $P$ is a Non-Torsion Point\nA point $P$ on an elliptic curve is a torsion point if it has finite order under the group law. This means there exists a positive integer $n$ such that $[n]P = \\mathcal{O}$, where $\\mathcal{O}$ is the point at infinity, which serves as the identity element of the group. If no such finite $n$ exists, $P$ is a point of infinite order.\n\nMazur's theorem on torsion subgroups states that for any elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}$, the order of a torsion point can only be one of the integers in the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12\\}$. Therefore, to prove that a point $P$ is of infinite order, it is sufficient to demonstrate that $[k]P \\neq \\mathcal{O}$ for all $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 12\\}$. Note that $[1]P = P$, which is never $\\mathcal{O}$ for an affine point $(x,y)$.\n\nThis verification requires implementing the group law for the curve $E^{(d)}$, which is in the short Weierstrass form $y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B$ with coefficients $A = -d^2$ and $B=0$.\n\nThe group law formulas are as follows:\n- **Identity Element**: The point at infinity, $\\mathcal{O}$.\n- **Inverse**: The inverse of a point $P_1 = (x_1, y_1)$ is $-P_1 = (x_1, -y_1)$.\n- **Point Addition**: Let $P_1 = (x_1, y_1)$ and $P_2 = (x_2, y_2)$ be two distinct points, neither of which is $\\mathcal{O}$.\n  - If $x_1 = x_2$, then $y_2 = -y_1$ and $P_1 + P_2 = \\mathcal{O}$.\n  - If $x_1 \\neq x_2$, their sum $P_3 = (x_3, y_3) = P_1 + P_2$ is given by:\n    $$ \\lambda = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} $$\n    $$ x_3 = \\lambda^2 - x_1 - x_2 $$\n    $$ y_3 = \\lambda(x_1 - x_3) - y_1 $$\n- **Point Doubling**: Let $P_1 = (x_1, y_1)$ be a point with $y_1 \\neq 0$. The sum $[2]P_1 = P_1 + P_1 = (x_3, y_3)$ is given by:\n  $$ \\lambda = \\frac{3x_1^2 + A}{2y_1} = \\frac{3x_1^2 - d^2}{2y_1} $$\n  $$ x_3 = \\lambda^2 - 2x_1 $$\n  $$ y_3 = \\lambda(x_1 - x_3) - y_1 $$\n  - If $y_1 = 0$, the point is a $2$-torsion point, and $[2]P_1 = \\mathcal{O}$.\n\nThe algorithm to check for torsion is:\n1.  If $y=0$, the point $P$ has order $2$, so it is a torsion point.\n2.  Otherwise, we iteratively compute the multiples of $P$. Let $Q_1 = P$.\n3.  For $k$ from $2$ to $12$, compute $Q_k = Q_{k-1} + P$. If at any step $Q_k = \\mathcal{O}$, then $P$ is a torsion point.\n4.  If none of the multiples $[2]P, \\dots, [12]P$ is $\\mathcal{O}$, we conclude $P$ is a point of infinite order.\n\nA point $P$ certifies that $E^{(d)}(\\mathbb{Q})$ has positive rank if and only if all three conditions (d is squarefree, $P$ is on the curve, $P$ is non-torsion) are met.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\nfrom fractions import Fraction\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the elliptic curve rank certification problem for a given set of test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Helper function to parse coordinate strings into Fraction objects.\n    def parse_coord(s):\n        if '/' in s:\n            num, den = map(int, s.split('/'))\n            return Fraction(num, den)\n        else:\n            return Fraction(int(s))\n\n    # The point at infinity, represented as None.\n    O = None\n\n    def is_squarefree(d):\n        \"\"\"\n        Checks if an integer d is squarefree.\n        A non-zero integer is squarefree if it is not divisible by any perfect square other than 1.\n        \"\"\"\n        if d == 0:\n            return False\n        \n        n = abs(d)\n        if n == 1:\n            return True\n\n        # Check for factor of 4\n        if n % 4 == 0:\n            return False\n\n        # Check for squares of odd primes\n        limit = math.isqrt(n)\n        for i in range(3, limit + 1, 2):\n            if n % (i*i) == 0:\n                return False\n        \n        return True\n\n    def add_points(p1, p2, d):\n        \"\"\"\n        Adds two points on the elliptic curve y^2 = x^3 - d^2*x.\n        \"\"\"\n        if p1 is O:\n            return p2\n        if p2 is O:\n            return p1\n\n        x1, y1 = p1\n        x2, y2 = p2\n        \n        A = -d*d\n\n        if x1 == x2 and y1 != y2: # p2 is the inverse of p1\n            return O\n        \n        if x1 != x2:\n            lam = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)\n            x3 = lam**2 - x1 - x2\n            y3 = lam * (x1 - x3) - y1\n            return (x3, y3)\n        elif x1 == x2 and y1 == y2: # Point doubling\n            if y1 == 0: # 2-torsion point\n                return O\n            lam = (3 * x1**2 + A) / (2 * y1)\n            x3 = lam**2 - 2 * x1\n            y3 = lam * (x1 - x3) - y1\n            return (x3, y3)\n        else:\n             # Should not be reached in this problem's context\n             return O\n    \n    def check_torsion(p, d):\n        \"\"\"\n        Checks if a point p is a torsion point by computing [k]p for k=1..12.\n        Returns True if p is a torsion point, False otherwise.\n        \"\"\"\n        if p[1] == 0: # 2-torsion point\n            return True\n            \n        current_multiple = p\n        # We start by computing [2]p, then [3]p etc up to [12]p\n        # [k]P = [k-1]P + P\n        for _ in range(2, 13):\n            current_multiple = add_points(current_multiple, p, d)\n            if current_multiple is O:\n                return True # It is a torsion point\n        \n        return False # It is a non-torsion point\n\n    def run_test(d, p_coords):\n        \"\"\"\n        Performs the complete verification for a single test case (d, P).\n        Returns True if P certifies rank  0, False otherwise.\n        \"\"\"\n        # 1.
