To do this, we must first determine the quantity $M(Q)$, which is the cardinality of the set $\\mathcal{A}_{Q}$.\n\nThe set $\\mathcal{A}_{Q}$ is given by\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}_{Q} \\;=\\; \\left\\{ \\frac{a}{q} \\bmod 1 \\;:\\; 1 \\leq q \\leq Q,\\; 1 \\leq a \\leq q,\\; \\gcd(a,q)=1 \\right\\}.\n$$\nThe elements of this set are rational numbers, considered modulo $1$. We need to find the number of distinct elements in this set, which is its cardinality $M(Q) = |\\mathcal{A}_{Q}|$.\n\nAn element in $\\mathcal{A}_{Q}$ is generated by a pair of integers $(a,q)$ satisfying the given conditions. Let's analyze if different pairs can produce the same element. Consider two such pairs, $(a_1, q_1)$ and $(a_2, q_2)$, satisfying the conditions. The corresponding rational numbers are $\\frac{a_1}{q_1}$ and $\\frac{a_2}{q_2}$. The condition $\\gcd(a_1, q_1) = 1$ and $\\gcd(a_2, q_2) = 1$ means that both fractions are in their lowest terms. If $\\frac{a_1}{q_1} = \\frac{a_2}{q_2}$, and both fractions are irreducible representations of the same rational number, then it must be that $a_1=a_2$ and $q_1=q_2$ (since $a, q$ are positive). The constraints on $a$ and $q$ are $1 \\leq q \\leq Q$ and $1 \\leq a \\leq q$. Thus, each unique pair $(a,q)$ satisfying the conditions generates a unique rational number $\\frac{a}{q}$. The `mod 1` operation identifies integers, but we need to check if any of these fractions are integers. The condition $1 \\leq a \\leq q$ implies $\\frac{a}{q} \\leq 1$. Equality $\\frac{a}{q}=1$ holds if and only if $a=q$. The condition $\\gcd(a,q)=1$ then becomes $\\gcd(q,q)=q=1$. So, the only pair for which $a=q$ is $(1,1)$, which yields the rational number $\\frac{1}{1}=1$. Modulo $1$, this corresponds to the element $0$. All other pairs have $a<q$, yielding numbers in the interval $(0,1)$. Therefore, all elements generated are unique within the interval $[0,1)$, and the cardinality of the set $\\mathcal{A}_{Q}$ is simply the total number of pairs $(a,q)$ that satisfy the given conditions.\n\nWe can calculate $M(Q)$ by summing over all possible values of the denominator $q$ from $1$ to $Q$. For each fixed value of $q$, we count the number of possible values for the numerator $a$.\n$$\nM(Q) = \\sum_{q=1}^{Q} (\\text{number of } a \\text{ such that } 1 \\leq a \\leq q \\text{ and } \\gcd(a,q)=1)\n$$\nBy definition, the number of positive integers less than or equal to $q$ and relatively prime to $q$ is Euler's totient function, $\\varphi(q)$.\nTherefore, the cardinality $M(Q)$ is the sum of the values of Euler's totient function for all integers from $1$ to $Q$:\n$$\nM(Q) = \\sum_{q=1}^{Q} \\varphi(q)\n$$\nThe problem asks for the computation of the constant $c$, defined as:\n$$\nc \\;=\\; \\lim_{Q \\to \\infty} \\frac{M(Q)}{Q^{2}}\n$$\nSubstituting our expression for $M(Q)$, we get:\n$$\nc \\;=\\; \\lim_{Q \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\sum_{q=1}^{Q} \\varphi(q)}{Q^{2}}\n$$\nThe problem provides the following known asymptotic relationship:\n$$\n\\sum_{q \\leq Q} \\varphi(q) \\sim \\frac{3}{\\pi^{2}} Q^{2} \\quad \\text{as } Q \\to \\infty\n$$\nThe notation $f(Q) \\sim g(Q)$ as $Q \\to \\infty$ means that $\\lim_{Q \\to \\infty} \\frac{f(Q)}{g(Q)} = 1$.

The number of points $M(Q)$ in the set $\\mathcal{A}_Q$ grows quadratically with $Q$, and more precisely, it is asymptotically equal to $\\frac{3}{\\pi^{2}} Q^{2}$.
