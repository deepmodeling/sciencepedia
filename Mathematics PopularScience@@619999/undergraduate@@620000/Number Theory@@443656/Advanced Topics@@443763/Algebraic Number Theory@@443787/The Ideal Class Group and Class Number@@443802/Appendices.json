The method specified is to use ideal class representatives of minimal norm, guided by results from the geometry of numbers, specifically the Minkowski bound.\n\nA fundamental result in algebraic number theory, derived from Minkowski's geometry of numbers, states that every ideal class in the ideal class group $\\operatorname{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_{K})$ of a number field $K$ contains an integral ideal $I \\subseteq \\mathcal{O}_{K}$ whose absolute norm $N(I)$ satisfies the inequality:\n$$ N(I) \\le M_K $$\nwhere $M_K$ is the Minkowski bound, given by the formula:\n$$ M_K = \\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\right)^{r_2} \\frac{n!}{n^n} |\\Delta_K|^{1/2} $$\nIn this formula, $n$ is the degree of the field extension $[K : \\mathbb{Q}]$, $r_1$ is the number of real embeddings of $K$, $r_2$ is the number of pairs of complex conjugate embeddings of $K$ (where $n=r_1+2r_2$), and $\\Delta_K$ is the discriminant of the field $K$.\n\nThe ideal class group $\\operatorname{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_{K})$ is generated by the classes of prime ideals whose norms are less than or equal to the Minkowski bound $M_K$. A particularly simple case arises if $M_K < 2$. In such a scenario, any integral ideal $I$ satisfying the bound must have norm $N(I)=1$. The only integral ideal with norm $1$ is the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ itself. Since $\\mathcal{O}_K$ is the principal ideal $(1)$, this implies that every ideal class is the principal ideal class. Consequently, the ideal class group is trivial, and the class number is $h_K=1$.\n\nWe will now apply this framework to the two specified fields.\n\n**Case 1: The field $K_{1} = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-1})$**\n\nFor this field, the parameter is $m=-1$. As an imaginary quadratic field, its degree is $n=2$. It has no real embeddings, so $r_1=0$, and one pair of complex conjugate embeddings, so $r_2=1$.\n\nThe discriminant $\\Delta_{K_1}$ is determined by the value of $m$ modulo $4$. Since $m=-1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, the discriminant is given by the formula $\\Delta_{K_1} = 4m = 4(-1) = -4$.\n\nWe can now compute the Minkowski bound $M_{K_{1}}$:\n$$ M_{K_{1}} = \\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\right)^{1} \\frac{2!}{2^2} |\\Delta_{K_{1}}|^{1/2} = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\cdot \\frac{2}{4} \\cdot |-4|^{1/2} = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\cdot \\sqrt{4} = \\frac{4}{\\pi} $$\nUsing the approximation $\\pi \\approx 3.14159$, the numerical value of the bound is $M_{K_{1}} \\approx 1.27$.\n\nSince $M_{K_{1}} < 2$, every ideal class in $\\operatorname{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_{K_{1}})$ must contain an integral ideal $I$ with norm $N(I) < 2$. The only integer value the norm of a non-zero integral ideal can take in this range is $N(I)=1$. The only ideal with norm equal to $1$ is the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_{K_{1}}$ itself. The ring of integers for $K_1$ is the ring of Gaussian integers, $\\mathcal{O}_{K_{1}} = \\mathbb{Z}[i]$. This is a principal ideal, as it is generated by the multiplicative identity, i.e., $\\mathcal{O}_{K_{1}} = (1)$.\n\nThis proves that the only ideal class is the principal ideal class. The explicit representative of minimal norm in this class (and thus in every class) is the ideal $(1)$. Because there is only one ideal class, the ideal class group $\\operatorname{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_{K_{1}})$ is the trivial group. Therefore, the class number is $h_{K_{1}} = 1$.\n\n**Case 2: The field $K_{2} = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-2})$**\n\nFor this field, the parameter is $m=-2$. It is also an imaginary quadratic field, so its parameters are $n=2$, $r_1=0$, and $r_2=1$. The ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_{K_2} = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-2}]$.\n\nThe discriminant $\\Delta_{K_2}$ for $m=-2$ must be calculated. Since $-2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$, the formula $\\Delta_{K_2} = 4m$ applies. Thus, $\\Delta_{K_2} = 4(-2) = -8$.\n\nNext, we compute the Minkowski bound $M_{K_{2}}$:\n$$ M_{K_{2}} = \\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\right)^{1} \\frac{2!}{2^2} |\\Delta_{K_2}|^{1/2} = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\cdot \\frac{2}{4} \\cdot |-8|^{1/2} = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\cdot \\sqrt{8} = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\cdot 2\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{2}}{\\pi} $$\nUsing approximations $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.414$ and $\\pi \\approx 3.14159$, the numerical value is $M_{K_{2}} \\approx \\frac{4(1.414)}{3.14159} \\approx 1.80$.\n\nAgain, we find that $M_{K_{2}} < 2$. Following the same logic as for $K_1$, we conclude that every ideal class in $\\operatorname{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_{K_{2}})$ must contain an integral ideal $I$ with norm $N(I) < 2$. The only such ideal is the one with norm $N(I)=1$, which is $I=\\mathcal{O}_{K_{2}}$.\n\nThe ideal $\\mathcal{O}_{K_{2}} = (1)$ is principal. The explicit representative of minimal norm is again $(1)$. Since every ideal class must be the principal class, the ideal class group $\\operatorname{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_{K_{2}})$ is trivial. Its cardinality, the class number, is therefore $h_{K_{2}}=1$.\n\nIn conclusion, for both fields $K_1 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-1})$ and $K_2 = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-2})$, the Minkowski bound is less than $2$. This forces any ideal class to contain the principal ideal $(1)$ as an integral ideal of minimal norm, compelling the ideal class group to be trivial in both instances. The class numbers are thus $h_{K_{1}}=1$ and $h_{K_{2}}=1$.\n\nThe required pair is $(h_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-1})}, h_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-2})}) = (1, 1)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3091587"}, {"introduction": "Having seen cases where unique factorization holds, we now explore the more intricate scenario of a non-trivial class group.

The Ring of Integers $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ and its Discriminant**\n\nThe field is $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ with $d=-5$. For a general square-free integer $d$, the ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}_K$ of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{d})$ is given by:\n- $\\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{d}]$ if $d \\equiv 2, 3 \\pmod{4}$\n- $\\mathbb{Z}[\\frac{1+\\sqrt{d}}{2}]$ if $d \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$\n\nIn our case, $d=-5$, and since $-5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$, the ring of integers is $\\mathcal{O}_{K} = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$.

Prime Ideal Factorizations**\n\nWe analyze the factorization of the ideal $(p)\\mathcal{O}_K$ for rational primes $p=2$ and $p=3$. A defining polynomial for the generator $\\sqrt{-5}$ of $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$ over $\\mathbb{Z}$ is $P(x) = x^2+5$. The behavior of a prime ideal $(p)$ is related to the factorization of $P(x)$ modulo $p$. This approach is guaranteed to work for primes $p$ that do not divide the index $[\\mathcal{O}_K : \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]]$. Since $\\mathcal{O}_K = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$, this index is $1$, so the method is valid for all primes.\n\n**Factorization of $(2)$:**\nWe consider the polynomial $P(x) = x^2+5$ over the field $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n$$ x^2+5 \\equiv x^2+1 \\equiv (x+1)^2 \\pmod{2} $$\nThe polynomial has a repeated root $x=1$ in $\\mathbb{F}_2$. This indicates that the prime $2$ ramifies in $\\mathcal{O}_K$. The ideal $(2)$ factors as the square of a prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ of norm $2$.\n$$ (2) = \\mathfrak{p}_2^2 $$\nThe prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ is given by $(2, \\sqrt{-5}-1)$. Since $1$ is the root modulo $2$, and $\\sqrt{-5}$ corresponds to $x$. As $-1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$, we can also write it as $\\mathfrak{p}_2 = (2, \\sqrt{-5}+1)$.\nThe norm of the ideal $(2)$ is $N((2)) = |N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(2)| = 2^2=4$. The multiplicativity of the norm implies $N((2)) = N(\\mathfrak{p}_2^2) = N(\\mathfrak{p}_2)^2$, so $N(\\mathfrak{p}_2) = \\sqrt{4}=2$.\n\n**Factorization of $(3)$:**\nWe consider the polynomial $P(x) = x^2+5$ over the field $\\mathbb{F}_3$.\n$$ x^2+5 \\equiv x^2+2 \\pmod{3} $$\nWe test for roots in $\\mathbb{F}_3 = \\{0, 1, 2\\}$:\n- $0^2+2 = 2 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$\n- $1^2+2 = 3 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$\n- $2^2+2 = 6 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$\nThe roots are $x=1$ and $x=2$. The polynomial factors as:\n$$ x^2+2 \\equiv (x-1)(x-2) \\pmod{3} $$\nSince the polynomial splits into distinct linear factors, the prime $3$ splits in $\\mathcal{O}_K$. The ideal $(3)$ factors into a product of two distinct prime ideals, $\\mathfrak{p}_3$ and $\\mathfrak{p}_3'$:\n$$ (3) = \\mathfrak{p}_3 \\mathfrak{p}_3' $$\nThese prime ideals are given by:\n$$ \\mathfrak{p}_3 = (3, \\sqrt{-5}-1) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mathfrak{p}_3' = (3, \\sqrt{-5}-2) $$\nThe norm of $(3)$ is $N((3)) = 3^2=9$. By multiplicativity, $N((3)) = N(\\mathfrak{p}_3) N(\\mathfrak{p}_3')=9$. Since $\\mathfrak{p}_3$ and $\\mathfrak{p}_3'$ are prime ideals, their norms must be powers of $3$. Thus, we must have $N(\\mathfrak{p}_3) = 3$ and $N(\\mathfrak{p}_3') = 3$.\n\n**3. The Ideal Class Number $h_{K}$**\n\nThe ideal class number $h_K$ is the order of the ideal class group $Cl(K)$. A fundamental result from the geometry of numbers, Minkowski's bound, states that every ideal class contains an integral ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ with norm satisfying:\n$$ N(\\mathfrak{a}) \\le M_K = \\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\right)^{r_2} \\frac{n!}{n^n} \\sqrt{|\\Delta_K|} $$\nFor $K=\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-5})$, we have degree $n=2$, discriminant $\\Delta_K = -20$, one pair of complex embeddings ($r_2=1$), and no real embeddings ($r_1=0$).\n$$ M_K = \\left(\\frac{4}{\\pi}\\right)^{1} \\frac{2!}{2^2} \\sqrt{|-20|} = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\cdot \\frac{2}{4} \\sqrt{20} = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\sqrt{4 \\cdot 5} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{5}}{\\pi} $$\nUsing the approximations $\\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.236$ and $\\pi \\approx 3.1416$, we get:\n$$ M_K \\approx \\frac{4 \\times 2.236}{3.1416} \\approx 2.847 $$\nThis bound implies that the ideal class group $Cl(K)$ is generated by the classes of prime ideals with norm less than or equal to $M_K \\approx 2.847$. The only rational prime $p \\le 2.847$ is $p=2$. Therefore, the class group is generated by the classes of prime ideals lying above the rational prime $2$.\n\nFrom our factorization of $(2)$, we know there is a single prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ above $(2)$, with $N(\\mathfrak{p}_2)=2$. Thus, the class group $Cl(K)$ is generated by the ideal class $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$.\n$$ Cl(K) = \\langle [\\mathfrak{p}_2] \\rangle $$\nTo determine the structure of this group, we must find the order of the generator $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$. The order is $1$ if and only if $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ is a principal ideal. An ideal $\\mathfrak{a}$ is principal if it can be written as $\\mathfrak{a} = (\\alpha)$ for some $\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{O}_K$. If $\\mathfrak{p}_2 = (\\alpha)$ for some $\\alpha = a+b\\sqrt{-5}$ with $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, then its norm would be $N(\\mathfrak{p}_2) = |N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)| = |a^2 - (-5)b^2| = a^2+5b^2$.\nWe found that $N(\\mathfrak{p}_2) = 2$. So we must find integers $a, b$ satisfying the Diophantine equation:\n$$ a^2 + 5b^2 = 2 $$\n- If $b \\ne 0$, then $b^2 \\ge 1$, which implies $5b^2 \\ge 5$. Then $a^2+5b^2 \\ge 5 > 2$. No solution.\n- If $b=0$, the equation becomes $a^2=2$. There is no integer $a$ such that $a^2=2$.\nThere are no integer solutions $(a,b)$ to this equation. Therefore, $\\mathfrak{p}_2$ is not a principal ideal.\n\nThis means its class $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$ is not the identity element in $Cl(K)$. Consequently, the class number $h_K > 1$.\nNow we consider the relation from the factorization $(2)=\\mathfrak{p}_2^2$. Taking the ideal classes of both sides:\n$$ [(2)] = [\\mathfrak{p}_2^2] = [\\mathfrak{p}_2]^2 $$\nThe ideal $(2)$ is principal, so its class $[(2)]$ is the identity element in the class group. Let this be denoted by $1$.\n$$ [\\mathfrak{p}_2]^2 = 1 $$\nThis shows that the element $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$ has order dividing $2$. Since we have already established that $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$ is not the identity (order is not $1$), its order must be exactly $2$.\nThe class group $Cl(K)$ is generated by an element of order $2$. Therefore, the group is cyclic of order $2$:\n$$ Cl(K) = \\{1, [\\mathfrak{p}_2]\\} \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} $$\nThe ideal class number $h_K$ is the order of this group.\n$$ h_K = |Cl(K)| = 2 $$\nOur analysis of the ideal $(3)$ showed that the prime ideals $\\mathfrak{p}_3$ and $\\mathfrak{p}_3'$ are also non-principal, as the equation $a^2+5b^2=3$ has no integer solutions. This is consistent with our result, as any non-principal ideal must belong to the single non-trivial class represented by $[\\mathfrak{p}_2]$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "3091567"}, {"introduction": "A non-trivial ideal class group means some ideals are not principal, which can feel like a breakdown of order.

The field is $K = \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{-5})$. The integer $-5$ is square-free and $-5 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$. Therefore, the ring of integers of $K$ is $\\mathcal{O}_{K} = \\mathbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-5}]$, and its discriminant is $\\Delta_{K} = 4(-5) = -20$.\n\nThe degree of the extension $K/\\mathbb{Q}$ is $n=2$.

Since $M_K < 3$, we only need to consider prime ideals with norm $2$.\n\nTo find prime ideals with norm $2$, we examine the factorization of the ideal $(2)\\mathcal{O}_{K}$ in $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$. The factorization is determined by the behavior of the polynomial $f(x) = x^2+5$ modulo $2$.\n$$ x^2+5 \\equiv x^2+1 \\equiv (x+1)^2 \\pmod{2} $$\nSince the polynomial has a repeated root $x \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$, the prime $2$ is ramified in $\\mathcal{O}_{K}$. The factorization is $(2)\\mathcal{O}_{K} = \\mathfrak{p}^2$ for a prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$ of norm $2$. This ideal is given by $\\mathfrak{p} = (2, 1+\\sqrt{-5})$. The norm of this ideal is $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\mathfrak{p})=2$.\n\nNext, we check if $\\mathfrak{p}$ is a principal ideal. An ideal is principal if it is generated by a single element. If $\\mathfrak{p} = (\\gamma)$ for some $\\gamma = a+b\\sqrt{-5} \\in \\mathcal{O}_{K}$, then the norm of the ideal would equal the absolute value of the norm of the element: $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\mathfrak{p}) = |N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\gamma)|$.\nThe norm of an element $a+b\\sqrt{-5}$ is $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(a+b\\sqrt{-5}) = a^2+5b^2$. So we are seeking integer solutions $(a,b)$ to the equation $a^2+5b^2 = 2$.\nIf $b \\neq 0$, then $b^2 \\ge 1$, which implies $5b^2 \\ge 5 > 2$.

A principal ideal represents the identity element in the class group. So, $[\\mathfrak{p}]^2$ is the identity.\nSince $\\mathfrak{p}$ is not principal, $[\\mathfrak{p}]$ is not the identity. Thus, the order of $[\\mathfrak{p}]$ is exactly $2$.\nThe class group is generated by an element of order $2$, so $\\mathrm{Cl}(\\mathcal{O}_{K}) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z}$.

For a tower of number fields $\\mathbb{Q} \\subset K \\subset L$ and an ideal $\\mathfrak{a} \\subset \\mathcal{O}_{K}$, the norm of the extended ideal $\\mathfrak{a}\\mathcal{O}_L$ is given by:\n$$ N_{L/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\mathfrak{a}\\mathcal{O}_{L}) = \\left(N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\mathfrak{a})\\right)^{[L:K]} $$\nIn our case, $\\mathfrak{a} = \\mathfrak{p}$. We have already found that $N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\mathfrak{p}) = 2$ and $[L:K] = 2$.\nSubstituting these values into the formula:\n$$ |N_{L/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)| = (2)^{2} = 4 $$\nThe absolute value of the field norm $N_{L/\\mathbb{Q}}(\\alpha)$ is $4$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{4} $$", "id": "3091608"}]}
