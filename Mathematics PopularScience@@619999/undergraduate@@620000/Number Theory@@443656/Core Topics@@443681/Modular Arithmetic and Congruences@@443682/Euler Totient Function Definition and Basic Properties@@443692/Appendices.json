It is a standard problem in elementary number theory. The constraints on the derivation method are clear and feasible. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the computation of $\\varphi(10^{12})$, where $\\varphi(n)$ is Euler's totient function. By definition, $\\varphi(n)$ counts the number of positive integers $k$ such that $1 \\le k \\le n$ and $\\gcd(k, n) = 1$. Let $n = 10^{12}$.\n\nThe first step is to obtain the prime factorization of $n$. The integer $10$ has the prime factorization $2 \\times 5$. Using the properties of exponents, we can factorize $n$:\n$$n = 10^{12} = (2 \\times 5)^{12} = 2^{12} \\times 5^{12}$$\nAn integer $k$ is coprime to $n$ if and only if $k$ shares no prime factors with $n$. The prime factors of $n$ are $2$ and $5$. Thus, for $\\gcd(k, 10^{12}) = 1$, $k$ must not be divisible by $2$ and must not be divisible by $5$.\n\nOur task is to count the integers $k$ in the set $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 10^{12}\\}$ that satisfy these two conditions. We will use a basic counting argument known as the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of all integers from $1$ to $n$, so the size of $S$ is $|S| = n = 10^{12}$.\nLet $A_2$ be the subset of $S$ containing integers divisible by $2$.\nLet $A_5$ be the subset of $S$ containing integers divisible by $5$.\n\nThe quantity we wish to compute, $\\varphi(n)$, is the number of elements in $S$ that are not in $A_2$ and not in $A_5$. In set notation, this is the size of the complement of $A_2 \\cup A_5$ within $S$. The number of integers to be counted is therefore $|S| - |A_2 \\cup A_5|$.\n\nAccording to the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion for two sets:\n$$|A_2 \\cup A_5| = |A_2| + |A_5| - |A_2 \\cap A_5|$$\nWe proceed to compute the size of each of these sets. The number of integers in $S$ that are divisible by a given integer $d$ is $\\lfloor n/d \\rfloor$. Since $n=10^{12}$ is an integer multiple of $2$, $5$, and $10$, the floor function is exact and may be omitted.\n\nThe size of $A_2$ is the number of multiples of $2$ in $S$:\n$$|A_2| = \\frac{n}{2} = \\frac{10^{12}}{2}$$\nThe size of $A_5$ is the number of multiples of $5$ in $S$:\n$$|A_5| = \\frac{n}{5} = \\frac{10^{12}}{5}$$\nThe set $A_2 \\cap A_5$ contains integers divisible by both $2$ and $5$. Since $2$ and $5$ are distinct prime numbers, an integer is divisible by both if and only if it is divisible by their product, $2 \\times 5 = 10$. The size of this intersection is the number of multiples of $10$ in $S$:\n$$|A_2 \\cap A_5| = \\frac{n}{10} = \\frac{10^{12}}{10} = 10^{11}$$\nThe total number of integers in $S$ that are divisible by at least one of the primes $2$ or $5$ is:\n$$|A_2 \\cup A_5| = \\frac{10^{12}}{2} + \\frac{10^{12}}{5} - \\frac{10^{12}}{10}$$\nThe number of integers coprime to $n$, $\\varphi(n)$, is the total number of integers minus those that are not coprime:\n$$\\varphi(10^{12}) = |S| - |A_2 \\cup A_5| = 10^{12} - \\left( \\frac{10^{12}}{2} + \\frac{10^{12}}{5} - \\frac{10^{12}}{10} \\right)$$\n$$\\varphi(10^{12}) = 10^{12} - \\frac{10^{12}}{2} - \\frac{10^{12}}{5} + \\frac{10^{12}}{10}$$\nBy factoring out $10^{12}$, we derive the formula for this specific case from first principles:\n$$\\varphi(10^{12}) = 10^{12} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{10} \\right)$$\nThe expression in the parenthesis can be algebraically factored, which reveals the structure that leads to the general formula for $\\varphi(n)$:\n$$1 - \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{10} = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) - \\frac{1}{5}\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{5}\\right)$$\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n$$\\varphi(10^{12}) = 10^{12} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{5}\\right)$$\nNow we perform the final computation:\n$$\\varphi(10^{12}) = 10^{12} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{5}$$\n$$\\varphi(10^{12}) = 10^{12} \\times \\frac{4}{10}$$\n$$\\varphi(10^{12}) = 4 \\times \\frac{10^{12}}{10} = 4 \\times 10^{11}$$\nThis is the exact value of $\\varphi(10^{12})$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4 \\times 10^{11}}$$", "id": "3084972"}, {"introduction": "Having derived the totient formula for a simple case, we now move to a more complex integer.

The calculation must start from the definition of $\\varphi(n)$ and elementary principles, justifying all properties used. Specifically, pre-derived formulas for $\\varphi(n)$ are forbidden, but the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) may be used after being stated.\n\nThe definition of the Euler totient function is given for a positive integer $n$ as the number of integers $a$ such that $1 \\le a \\le n$ and $\\gcd(a,n)=1$.\n\nTo compute $\\varphi(360)$, we first need to establish two key properties of $\\varphi(n)$ using only the provided definition and elementary counting principles.\n\nFirst, we will establish that $\\varphi(n)$ is a multiplicative function. A function $f$ is multiplicative if for any two coprime integers $m$ and $n$ (i.e., $\\gcd(m,n)=1$), it satisfies $f(mn) = f(m)f(n)$.\n\nTo justify this property for $\\varphi(n)$, we invoke the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), as permitted.\nThe Chinese Remainder Theorem states that if $m$ and $n$ are coprime positive integers, then for any pair of integers $(a, b)$, the system of simultaneous congruences:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nx \\equiv a \\pmod{m} \\\\\nx \\equiv b \\pmod{n}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nhas a unique solution for $x$ modulo $mn$.\nThis theorem establishes a one-to-one correspondence (a bijection) between integers $x$ in the set $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, mn\\}$ and pairs of integers $(a, b)$ where $a \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, m\\}$ and $b \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}$. The mapping is given by $x \\mapsto (x \\pmod m, x \\pmod n)$.\n\nWe are interested in counting the integers $x$ such that $1 \\le x \\le mn$ and $\\gcd(x, mn)=1$. The condition $\\gcd(x, mn)=1$ holds if and only if $x$ is not divisible by any prime factor of $mn$. Since $m$ and $n$ are coprime, their prime factors are distinct. Thus, $\\gcd(x, mn)=1$ is equivalent to the pair of conditions $\\gcd(x,m)=1$ and $\\gcd(x,n)=1$.\n\nLet $a = x \\pmod m$ and $b = x \\pmod n$. An elementary property of the greatest common divisor states that $\\gcd(x, m) = \\gcd(x \\pmod m, m) = \\gcd(a, m)$, and similarly $\\gcd(x, n) = \\gcd(x \\pmod n, n) = \\gcd(b, n)$.\nTherefore, the condition $\\gcd(x, mn)=1$ is equivalent to the pair of conditions $\\gcd(a, m)=1$ and $\\gcd(b, n)=1$.\n\nThis implies that the bijection established by the CRT restricts to a bijection between the set of integers $x \\in \\{1, \\dots, mn\\}$ coprime to $mn$ and the set of pairs $(a, b)$ where $a \\in \\{1, \\dots, m\\}$ is coprime to $m$ and $b \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ is coprime to $n$.\n\nBy definition, the number of such integers $a$ is $\\varphi(m)$, and the number of such integers $b$ is $\\varphi(n)$. By the elementary principle of counting for Cartesian products (the rule of product), the total number of such pairs $(a, b)$ is the product $\\varphi(m)\\varphi(n)$.\nSince there is a bijection between the set of $x$'s we want to count and the set of pairs $(a,b)$, the sizes of these two sets must be equal. Therefore, we have justified that for $\\gcd(m,n)=1$,\n$$\n\\varphi(mn) = \\varphi(m)\\varphi(n)\n$$\n\nSecond, we need to find a way to compute $\\varphi(p^k)$ for a prime $p$ and an integer $k \\ge 1$.\nBy definition, $\\varphi(p^k)$ is the count of integers $a$ such that $1 \\le a \\le p^k$ and $\\gcd(a, p^k)=1$.\nThe condition $\\gcd(a, p^k)=1$ means that $a$ does not share any prime factors with $p^k$. Since the only prime factor of $p^k$ is $p$, this is equivalent to the condition that $a$ is not divisible by $p$.\n\nWe can find $\\varphi(p^k)$ by taking the total number of integers from $1$ to $p^k$, which is $p^k$, and subtracting the number of integers in this range that are *not* coprime to $p^k$. The integers not coprime to $p^k$ are precisely the multiples of $p$.\nThe multiples of $p$ in the set $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, p^k\\}$ are $p, 2p, 3p, \\ldots, m \\cdot p$ such that $m \\cdot p \\leq p^k$.\nThis inequality simplifies to $m \\leq p^{k-1}$. So, the multiples of $p$ are $1 \\cdot p, 2 \\cdot p, \\ldots, p^{k-1} \\cdot p$.\nThere are exactly $p^{k-1}$ such multiples.\nUsing complementary counting, the number of integers coprime to $p^k$ is the total number of integers minus the count of those not coprime to $p^k$.\n$$\n\\varphi(p^k) = (\\text{total integers}) - (\\text{multiples of } p) = p^k - p^{k-1}\n$$\nThis formula is derived solely from the definition and elementary counting.\n\nNow we can proceed to compute $\\varphi(360)$.\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of $360$.\n$$360 = 36 \\times 10 = (6^2) \\times (2 \\times 5) = (2 \\times 3)^2 \\times 2 \\times 5 = (2^2 \\times 3^2) \\times 2 \\times 5 = 2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1$$\nThe integer $360$ is expressed as a product of prime powers: $2^3$, $3^2$, and $5^1$. These factors are pairwise coprime.\n\nUsing the multiplicative property of $\\varphi(n)$ that we justified:\n$$\n\\varphi(360) = \\varphi(2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 5^1) = \\varphi(2^3) \\varphi(3^2) \\varphi(5^1)\n$$\nNow we apply the formula for $\\varphi(p^k)$ to each term:\nFor $\\varphi(2^3)$, we have $p=2$ and $k=3$:\n$$\n\\varphi(2^3) = 2^3 - 2^{3-1} = 2^3 - 2^2 = 8 - 4 = 4\n$$\nFor $\\varphi(3^2)$, we have $p=3$ and $k=2$:\n$$\n\\varphi(3^2) = 3^2 - 3^{2-1} = 3^2 - 3^1 = 9 - 3 = 6\n$$\nFor $\\varphi(5^1)$, we have $p=5$ and $k=1$:\n$$\n\\varphi(5^1) = 5^1 - 5^{1-1} = 5^1 - 5^0 = 5 - 1 = 4\n$$\nFinally, we multiply these results together to find $\\varphi(360)$:\n$$\n\\varphi(360) = 4 \\times 6 \\times 4 = 24 \\times 4 = 96\n$$\nThe value of $\\varphi(360)$ is $96$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{96}$$", "id": "3084966"}, {"introduction": "The behavior of $\\varphi(n)$ is most famously described by its multiplicative property, where $\\varphi(mn) = \\varphi(m)\\varphi(n)$ for coprime $m$ and $n$.

If an integer $k$ is coprime to $n$ (i.e., $\\gcd(k,n)=1$), it means that $k$ shares no prime factors with $n$. Since $p$ is a prime factor of $n$, it must be that $p$ is not a prime factor of $k$. As $p$ is prime, the statement \"$p$ is not a prime factor of $k$\" is equivalent to $p$ not dividing $k$, which in turn is equivalent to $\\gcd(k,p)=1$.\nTherefore, for any integer $k$, the condition $\\gcd(k,n)=1$ implies the condition $\\gcd(k,p)=1$.\n\nThis simplifies our problem significantly. The compound condition `$\\gcd(k,p)=1$ AND $\\gcd(k,n)=1$` is logically equivalent to the single condition `$\\gcd(k,n)=1$`, because the first part is redundant.\n\nSo, calculating $\\varphi(pn)$ is equivalent to counting the number of integers $k$ in the range $1 \\le k \\le pn$ that are coprime to $n$ (i.e., $\\gcd(k,n)=1$).\n\nLet's proceed with this count. We can partition the set of integers from $1$ to $pn$ into $p$ consecutive blocks, each of length $n$:\nBlock $1$: $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$\nBlock $2$: $\\{n+1, n+2, \\dots, 2n\\}$\n...\nBlock $j$: $\\{(j-1)n+1, (j-1)n+2, \\dots, jn\\}$ for $j=1, 2, \\dots, p$.\n\nConsider an arbitrary integer $k$ from one of these blocks. It can be written in the form $k = qn + r$, where $q$ is an integer and $1 \\le r \\le n$. The value of $q$ ranges from $0$ for the first block to $p-1$ for the last block.\nUsing the property of the $\\gcd$ that $\\gcd(A,B) = \\gcd(A+CB, B)$ for any integer $C$, we have:\n$$ \\gcd(k,n) = \\gcd(qn+r, n) = \\gcd(r,n) $$\nThis means that an integer $k = qn+r$ is coprime to $n$ if and only if its remainder $r$ (when divided by $n$) is coprime to $n$.\n\nBy the definition of $\\varphi(n)$, there are exactly $\\varphi(n)$ integers $r$ in the range $1 \\le r \\le n$ such that $\\gcd(r,n)=1$.\nBecause of the relationship $\\gcd(k,n) = \\gcd(r,n)$, the number of integers coprime to $n$ in each block of length $n$ is exactly $\\varphi(n)$.\nSince the range $1 \\le k \\le pn$ consists of $p$ such blocks, the total number of integers $k$ in this range that are coprime to $n$ is the sum of the counts from each block:\n$$ \\underbrace{\\varphi(n) + \\varphi(n) + \\dots + \\varphi(n)}_{p \\text{ times}} = p\\,\\varphi(n) $$\nAs established, this count is precisely $\\varphi(pn)$.\nThus, we have derived the relationship:\n$$ \\varphi(pn) = p\\,\\varphi(n) $$\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\n\nA. $\\varphi(pn)=p\\,\\varphi(n)$\nThis matches our derivation.
