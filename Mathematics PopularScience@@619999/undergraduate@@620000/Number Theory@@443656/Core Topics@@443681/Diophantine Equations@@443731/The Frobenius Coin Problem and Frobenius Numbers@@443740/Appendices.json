By focusing on the simplest non-trivial case with two coprime generators, you will use residue class analysis to systematically identify all non-representable numbers, or 'gaps'.

The Frobenius number is the largest positive integer not belonging to a numerical semigroup. We are asked to derive this result from first principles using congruences and to list all integers not in $S(7,11)$, which are called gaps.\n\nLet $a=7$ and $b=11$. We are given that $\\gcd(a,b) = \\gcd(7,11)=1$, which is a necessary condition for the Frobenius number to exist. An integer $n$ is representable if it can be written in the form $n = ax + by$ for non-negative integers $x$ and $y$.\n\nWe will analyze the representability of integers by considering their residue classes modulo $a=7$.\nAn integer $n$ is in $S(7,11)$ if $n = 7x + 11y$ for some $x,y \\ge 0$.\nTaking this equation modulo $7$, we get $n \\equiv 11y \\pmod{7}$. Since $11 \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$, this simplifies to $n \\equiv 4y \\pmod{7}$.\n\nFor an integer $n$ to be representable, it must be possible to find non-negative integers $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the equation. For any choice of $y \\ge 0$, a unique residue class for $n$ modulo $7$ is determined. Since $\\gcd(4,7)=1$, as $y$ takes on integer values, $4y$ will eventually cover all residue classes modulo $7$. Specifically, as $y$ ranges from $0$ to $6$, $4y \\pmod{7}$ gives $\\{0,4,1,5,2,6,3\\}$, which is a complete residue system modulo $7$.\n\nThis implies that for any integer $n$, there exists a $y_0 \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$ such that $n \\equiv 4y_0 \\pmod{7}$. This means $n-11y_0$ is a multiple of $7$, i.e., $n-11y_0 = 7x_0$ for some integer $x_0$. Thus, any integer $n$ can be written as $n = 7x_0 + 11y_0$ for some integers $x_0, y_0$ with $0 \\le y_0 \\le 6$. However, for $n$ to be in $S(7,11)$, we require $x_0 \\ge 0$.\n\nLet's find, for each residue class $k \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$ modulo $7$, the smallest integer $t_k \\in S(7,11)$ such that $t_k \\equiv k \\pmod{7}$.\nFor a number $n = 7x+11y$ to be the smallest in its residue class, we should use the smallest possible number of $7$s. Any member of $S(7,11)$ is a sum of $7$s and $11$s. To find the smallest member in a given residue class modulo $7$, we should use only $11$s, as adding $7$s does not change the residue class but increases the number.\nThus, $t_k$ must be of the form $11y_k$ for the smallest non-negative integer $y_k$ such that $11y_k \\equiv k \\pmod{7}$, or $4y_k \\equiv k \\pmod{7}$.\n\nWe calculate $t_k$ for each $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 6\\}$:\n- For $k=0$: $4y \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}$. Smallest $y \\ge 0$ is $y=0$. So, $t_0 = 11 \\times 0 = 0$.\n- For $k=1$: $4y \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$. Multiplying by $2$ (the inverse of $4$ mod $7$) gives $8y \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$, so $y \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$. Smallest $y \\ge 0$ is $y=2$. So, $t_1 = 11 \\times 2 = 22$.\n- For $k=2$: $4y \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$. Multiplying by $2$ gives $y \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$. Smallest $y \\ge 0$ is $y=4$. So, $t_2 = 11 \\times 4 = 44$.\n- For $k=3$: $4y \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$. Multiplying by $2$ gives $y \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7}$. Smallest $y \\ge 0$ is $y=6$. So, $t_3 = 11 \\times 6 = 66$.\n- For $k=4$: $4y \\equiv 4 \\pmod{7}$. This gives $y \\equiv 1 \\pmod{7}$. Smallest $y \\ge 0$ is $y=1$. So, $t_4 = 11 \\times 1 = 11$.\n- For $k=5$: $4y \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7}$. Multiplying by $2$ gives $y \\equiv 10 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$. Smallest $y \\ge 0$ is $y=3$. So, $t_5 = 11 \\times 3 = 33$.\n- For $k=6$: $4y \\equiv 6 \\pmod{7}$. Multiplying by $2$ gives $y \\equiv 12 \\equiv 5 \\pmod{7}$. Smallest $y \\ge 0$ is $y=5$. So, $t_6 = 11 \\times 5 = 55$.\n\nThe set of smallest representable numbers for each residue class is $\\{t_0, t_1, t_2, t_3, t_4, t_5, t_6\\} = \\{0, 22, 44, 66, 11, 33, 55\\}$.\nAny integer $n$ is representable if and only if it is greater than or equal to the smallest representable number in its residue class. That is, if $n \\equiv k \\pmod{7}$, then $n \\in S(7,11)$ if and only if $n \\ge t_k$. This is because if $n \\ge t_k$, then $n - t_k$ is a non-negative multiple of $7$. Let $n-t_k = 7m$ for $m \\ge 0$. As $t_k \\in S(7,11)$, we can write $t_k = 7x_k+11y_k$ (in our construction, $x_k=0$). Then $n = t_k+7m = 7(x_k+m)+11y_k$, which is a valid representation since $x_k+m \\ge 0$ and $y_k \\ge 0$.\n\nThis observation explains why all sufficiently large integers are representable. Any integer $n$ greater than or equal to $\\max(t_k) = 66$ is guaranteed to be representable, because for any $k$, $n \\ge \\max(t_k) \\ge t_k$.\n\nThe Frobenius number $g(7,11)$ is the largest integer that is not representable. A number $n$ is not representable (is a gap) if $n < t_k$ where $n \\equiv k \\pmod{7}$. To find the largest such gap, we should look for a number just below one of the $t_k$ values. The largest gap will be of the form $t_k - 7$ for some $k$, and to maximize this value, we should choose the $k$ for which $t_k$ is largest.\nThe maximum value in the set $\\{t_k\\}$ is $t_3 = 66$.\nThe largest candidate for a gap is therefore $t_3 - 7 = 66-7=59$.\nLet's verify this. The number $n=59$ has residue $59 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$. The smallest representable number in this residue class is $t_3=66$. Since $59 < 66$, $59$ is a gap.\n\nNow we must show that any integer $n > 59$ is representable. Let $n>59$ and $n \\equiv k \\pmod{7}$. We must show that $n \\ge t_k$.\n- If $k \\in \\{0,1,2,4,5,6\\}$, then $t_k \\in \\{0, 22, 44, 11, 33, 55\\}$. The largest of these is $t_6=55$. Since $n > 59$, we have $n > 55 \\ge t_k$. Thus, $n$ is representable.\n- If $k=3$, then $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{7}$ and $n > 59$. The integers that satisfy this are $66, 73, 80, \\dots$. The smallest such integer is $66$. For any such $n$, we have $n \\ge 66$. The smallest representable number in this class is $t_3 = 66$. Thus, we have $n \\ge t_3$, which means $n$ is representable.\nIn all cases, if $n>59$, then $n$ is representable.\nTherefore, the largest non-representable integer, the Frobenius number, is $g(7,11)=59$.\n\nTo verify, we list all gaps. A positive integer $n$ is a gap if $n>0$ and $n < t_k$ where $n \\equiv k \\pmod{7}$.\n- $k=0$ ($t_0=0$): No positive gaps.\n- $k=1$ ($t_1=22$): Gaps are $22-7=15$, $22-14=8$, $22-21=1$.\n- $k=2$ ($t_2=44$): Gaps are $37, 30, 23, 16, 9, 2$.\n- $k=3$ ($t_3=66$): Gaps are $59, 52, 45, 38, 31, 24, 17, 10, 3$.\n- $k=4$ ($t_4=11$): Gap is $11-7=4$.\n- $k=5$ ($t_5=33$): Gaps are $26, 19, 12, 5$.\n- $k=6$ ($t_6=55$): Gaps are $48, 41, 34, 27, 20, 13, 6$.\nCollecting and sorting all gaps, we get the set:\n$\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 23, 24, 26, 27, 30, 31, 34, 37, 38, 41, 45, 48, 52, 59\\}$.\nThe largest number in this list is indeed $59$, which verifies our result. The total number of gaps is $30$, which agrees with the known formula for the number of gaps for two generators, $N(a,b) = \\frac{(a-1)(b-1)}{2} = \\frac{(7-1)(11-1)}{2} = \\frac{6 \\times 10}{2} = 30$.\nThe general formula for the Frobenius number for two coprime integers $a, b$ is $g(a,b) = ab-a-b$. For our case, $g(7,11) = 7 \\times 11 - 7 - 11 = 77 - 18 = 59$.

We are to solve this by following a specific procedure involving residue classes.\n\nFirst, let us establish the core definitions. A numerical semigroup $S$ is a subset of the non-negative integers $\\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}$ that is closed under addition, contains $0$, and has a finite complement in $\\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}$. For a set of positive integers $A = \\{a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n\\}$ with $\\text{gcd}(a_1, \\dots, a_n) = 1$, the numerical semigroup generated by $A$ is the set $S = \\langle a_1, \\dots, a_n \\rangle = \\{\\sum_{i=1}^n k_i a_i \\,:\\, k_i \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}\\}$. The condition $\\text{gcd}(a_1, \\dots, a_n) = 1$ guarantees that the set of integers not in $S$, called the set of gaps of $S$, is finite. The largest integer not belonging to $S$ is called the Frobenius number of $A$, denoted $g(A)$ or $g(a_1, \\dots, a_n)$.\n\nIn this problem, $A = \\{3, 10, 17\\}$ and $S = \\langle 3, 10, 17 \\rangle = \\{3a + 10b + 17c \\,:\\, a,b,c \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}\\}$. The smallest generator is $a_1 = 3$. The core of the prescribed method is to analyze the elements of $S$ based on their residue classes modulo $3$.\n\nAn integer $N$ can be expressed as $N = 3q + r$, where $q$ is an integer and $r \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$ is the remainder. For $N$ to be an element of $S$, it must be a non-negative integer linear combination of $3$, $10$, and $17$.\nAny element $s \\in S$ can be written as $s = 3a + 10b + 17c$. The residue of $s$ modulo $3$ is given by:\n$$s \\equiv (3a + 10b + 17c) \\pmod{3}$$\n$$s \\equiv (0 \\cdot a + 1 \\cdot b + 2 \\cdot c) \\pmod{3}$$\n$$s \\equiv (b + 2c) \\pmod{3}$$\nThis shows that the residue class of an element in $S$ is determined solely by the coefficients of $10$ and $17$.\n\nThe first step is to construct the minimal representatives in $S$ for each residue class modulo $3$. For each $r \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$, let $m_r$ be the smallest element in $S$ such that $m_r \\equiv r \\pmod{3}$.\n$$m_r = \\min\\{s \\in S \\,:\\, s \\equiv r \\pmod{3}\\}$$\nAs shown above, any $s \\in S$ can be written as $3a + (10b + 17c)$. This implies that $m_r$ must be of the form $10b+17c$ for some $b, c \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}$, because if $m_r = 3a + 10b + 17c$ with $a>0$, then $m_r-3 = 3(a-1)+10b+17c$ would be a smaller element in $S$ with the same residue modulo $3$, contradicting the minimality of $m_r$. Thus, we need to find the smallest values of $10b+17c$ for each residue class.\n\n**Construction of minimal representatives:**\n\n1.  **Residue class $r=0$:** We seek $m_0 = \\min\\{10b + 17c \\,:\\, b, c \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}, b+2c \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}\\}$.\n    The smallest possible non-negative value for $10b+17c$ is achieved when $b=0$ and $c=0$. This gives $10(0) + 17(0) = 0$. The condition is satisfied, as $0 + 2(0) = 0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$. Thus, $m_0 = 0$.\n\n2.  **Residue class $r=1$:** We seek $m_1 = \\min\\{10b + 17c \\,:\\, b, c \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}, b+2c \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}\\}$.\n    We test combinations of non-negative integers $b$ and $c$ that satisfy the congruence:\n    -   If $b=1, c=0$: $1+2(0)=1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$. The value is $10(1)+17(0)=10$.\n    -   If $b=0, c=2$: $0+2(2)=4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$. The value is $10(0)+17(2)=34$.\n    -   If $b=2, c=1$: $2+2(1)=4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$. The value is $10(2)+17(1)=37$.\n    -   If $b=4, c=0$: $4+2(0)=4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{3}$. The value is $10(4)+17(0)=40$.\n    To ensure we have the minimum, we can argue that an increase of 1 in $b$ increases the sum by $10$ and an increase of 1 in $c$ increases the sum by $17$. We are looking for the minimum sum, so we prioritize small values for $b$ and $c$. The smallest value found among these initial candidates is $10$. Any other combination would yield a larger sum. For instance, increasing $b$ to $1$ adds $10$, while increasing $c$ to $1$ adds $17$. We want to use the smallest \"coin\" as much as possible, but here we are minimizing the sum. The smallest combination satisfying the congruence is indeed $(b,c)=(1,0)$.\n    Thus, $m_1 = 10$.\n\n3.  **Residue class $r=2$:** We seek $m_2 = \\min\\{10b + 17c \\,:\\, b, c \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}, b+2c \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}\\}$.\n    We test combinations:\n    -   If $b=0, c=1$: $0+2(1)=2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$. The value is $10(0)+17(1)=17$.\n    -   If $b=2, c=0$: $2+2(0)=2 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$. The value is $10(2)+17(0)=20$.\n    -   If $b=1, c=2$: $1+2(2)=5 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{3}$. The value is $10(1)+17(2)=44$.\n    Comparing the candidates $17$ and $20$, the minimum is $17$. Other combinations will yield larger values.\n    Thus, $m_2 = 17$.\n\nThe set of minimal representatives is $\\{m_0, m_1, m_2\\} = \\{0, 10, 17\\}$.\n\n**Explanation for the Frobenius number formula:**\n\nNow we explain why the Frobenius number is $g(3, 10, 17) = \\max(m_0, m_1, m_2) - 3$.\nFor any integer $N$, let $r = N \\pmod{3}$ be its remainder modulo $3$. We have established that for each $r \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$, $m_r$ is the smallest number in the semigroup $S$ that is congruent to $r$ modulo $3$.\n\nLet's determine for which integers $N$ it holds that $N \\in S$.\nAn integer $N$ belongs to $S$ if and only if $N \\ge m_r$, where $r = N \\pmod{3}$.\nLet's prove this statement:\n-   ($\\Rightarrow$) If $N \\in S$ and $N \\equiv r \\pmod{3}$, then by the definition of $m_r$ as the minimum such element, it must be that $N \\ge m_r$.\n-   ($\\Leftarrow$) If $N \\ge m_r$ and $N \\equiv r \\pmod{3}$, then $N-m_r$ is a non-negative multiple of $3$. So, $N-m_r = 3k$ for some integer $k \\ge 0$. This can be rewritten as $N = m_r + 3k$. Since $m_r \\in S$ and $3k \\in S$ (as $3 \\in S$), their sum $N$ must also be in $S$ due to the closure property of the semigroup.\n\nTherefore, an integer $N$ is NOT in $S$ if and only if $N < m_r$, where $r = N \\pmod{3}$.\nThe Frobenius number $g(3,10,17)$ is the largest integer that is not in $S$. We are looking for the maximum of all such \"gap\" integers. For each residue class $r \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$, the largest integer congruent to $r$ modulo $3$ that is not in $S$ is the largest integer $N$ such that $N \\equiv r \\pmod{3}$ and $N < m_r$. This number is precisely $m_r - 3$.\n\nThe set of all non-representable numbers is the union of the non-representable numbers from each residue class. The largest of all these numbers, the Frobenius number, will be the maximum of the largest non-representable numbers from each class:\n$$g(3, 10, 17) = \\max\\{m_0-3, m_1-3, m_2-3\\}$$\nThis is equivalent to:\n$$g(3, 10, 17) = \\left(\\max\\{m_0, m_1, m_2\\}\\right) - 3$$\n\n**Final Calculation:**\nUsing the minimal representatives we computed:\n$m_0 = 0$\n$m_1 = 10$\n$m_2 = 17$\n\nThe maximum of these representatives is $\\max\\{0, 10, 17\\} = 17$.\nApplying the formula for the Frobenius number:\n$$g(3, 10, 17) = 17 - 3 = 14$$\n\nThe largest integer that cannot be expressed in the form $3a + 10b + 17c$ for non-negative integers $a, b, c$ is $14$. For example, let's verify that $14 \\notin S$. $14 = 3a+10b+17c$. Since $17 > 14$, $c$ must be $0$. So $14 = 3a+10b$. If $b=0$, $3a=14$ has no integer solution for $a$. If $b=1$, $3a=4$ has no integer solution. If $b \\ge 2$, $10b > 14$. Thus, $14$ cannot be formed. Any integer greater than $14$ can be. For example: $15 = 3(5)$, $16 = \\text{?}$. $16 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 3$. $m_1=10$. $16 \\ge 10$, so $16$ must be in $S$. $16 = 10+6 = 10(1)+3(2)$. It is. $17 = 17(1)$. $18=3(6)$. $19 = m_1+9 = 10+3(3)$. $20=10(2)$.

Any integer $n$ can be classified by its remainder modulo $4$. For any integer $n$ to be an element of $S$, it must be representable. If an integer $m$ is in $S$, then any integer $m+4k$ for $k \\ge 0$ is also in $S$, since $m+4k$ is a non-negative integer linear combination of the generators.\n\nThis means that for each residue class $r \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$ modulo $4$, there is a smallest number $t_r \\in S$ such that $t_r \\equiv r \\pmod{4}$.

Thus, $t_0 = 0$.\n\n-   **Residue class $r=1$**: We seek the smallest non-negative integer combination of $7$ and $9$ that is congruent to $1 \\pmod{4}$. This is equivalent to finding the minimum of $7y+9z$ subject to $3y+z \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$ for $y,z \\ge 0$.\n    -   If $z=1$, $y=0$: $9 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. This gives the number $9$.\n    -   If $y=2$, $z=3$: $3(2)+3 = 9 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. This gives $7(2)+9(3) = 14+27 = 41$.\n    -   The smallest such number is clearly $9$. So, $t_1 = 9$.\n\n-   **Residue class $r=2$**: We seek the smallest value of $7y+9z$ subject to $3y+z \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$ for $y,z \\ge 0$.\n    -   If $y=0$, $z \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$. Smallest $z$ is $2$. This gives $9(2) = 18$.\n    -   If $y=1$, $3+z \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4} \\implies z \\equiv -1 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$. Smallest $z$ is $3$. This gives $7(1)+9(3) = 7+27=34$.\n    -   If $y=2$, $6+z \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4} \\implies 2+z \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4} \\implies z \\equiv 0 \\pmod{4}$. Smallest $z$ is $0$. This gives $7(2)+9(0) = 14$.\n    -   Comparing $18$, $34$, $14$, the minimum is $14$. So, $t_2 = 14$.\n\n-   **Residue class $r=3$**: We seek the smallest value of $7y+9z$ subject to $3y+z \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$ for $y,z \\ge 0$.\n    -   If $y=1$, $z=0$: $3(1)+0 = 3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$. This gives the number $7$.\n    -   If $z=3$, $y=0$: $3 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$. This gives $9(3)=27$.\n    -   The smallest such number is $7$. So, $t_3 = 7$.\n\nThe set of smallest representable numbers for each class is $\\{t_0, t_1, t_2, t_3\\} = \\{0, 9, 14, 7\\}$. The maximum of these is $\\max\\{0, 9, 14, 7\\} = 14$.\nThe Frobenius number is $g = 14 - 4 = 10$.\n\nThe set of gaps (non-representable numbers) is $\\{1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10\\}$. All integers greater than $10$ are in $S$, as confirmed by the set of four consecutive members $11 = 4+7$, $12 = 3 \\times 4$, $13 = 4+9$, and $14 = 2 \\times 7$.\n\n**Part 2: Breakdown of symmetry for $k \\ge 3$ generators**\n\nFor a numerical semigroup generated by two coprime integers, $S = \\langle a_1, a_2 \\rangle$, the Frobenius number is $g = a_1a_2 - a_1 - a_2$. For such semigroups, a key property holds: for any integer $n$, exactly one of $n$ and $g-n$ is an element of $S$. This property creates a perfect symmetry in the distribution of gaps and representable numbers in the interval $[0, g]$. An immediate consequence is that the number of gaps is exactly $\\frac{g+1}{2}$.\n\nThis pairing argument and its resulting symmetry break down for semigroups with $k \\ge 3$ generators. To explain why, we first analyze the implications of the pairing property. If for some $n$, both $n \\in S$ and $g-n \\in S$, then their sum $n + (g-n) = g$ must also be in $S$ because a semigroup is closed under addition. However, $g$ is by definition not in $S$. This constitutes a contradiction. Therefore, it is impossible for both $n$ and $g-n$ to be in $S$, regardless of the number of generators.\n\nThe breakdown of the pairing argument must then arise from the only other possibility that violates the \"exactly one\" condition: the existence of an integer $n$ such that **neither** $n$ **nor** $g-n$ is in $S$. In other words, both $n$ and $g-n$ are gaps.\n\nWe can demonstrate this breakdown using our computed result for $S = \\langle 4, 7, 9 \\rangle$, which has $g=10$.\nLet us test the integer $n=5$.\n-   Is $n=5$ in $S$? A number $5$ cannot be formed as $4x+7y+9z$ with non-negative integers $x,y,z$. So, $5 \\notin S$.\n-   Is $g-n$ in $S$? The corresponding paired integer is $g-n = 10-5 = 5$. As we have just established, $5 \\notin S$.\n\nSince for $n=5$, both $n$ and $g-n$ are gaps, the pairing principle fails. This single counterexample is sufficient to demonstrate the breakdown of the symmetry argument for $k=3$. The set of gaps is $\\{1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10\\}$, which is not symmetric around $g/2=5$. For example, $1$ is a gap but $g-1=9$ is in $S$, whereas $5$ is a gap and $g-5=5$ is also a gap. The number of gaps is $6$, which is not equal to $(g+1)/2 = (10+1)/2 = 5.5$.\n\nThe fundamental reason for this breakdown is the loss of a simple duality that exists in the two-generator case. For $S=\\langle a_1, a_2 \\rangle$, the representability of an integer $n$ is determined by a unique canonical representation modulo $a_1$, which has a symmetric dual for $g-n$. For $k \\ge 3$ generators, determining the smallest representable number in a congruence class modulo $a_1$ involves solving a subproblem on the semigroup $\\langle a_2, \\dots, a_k \\rangle$, which introduces a more complex structure that lacks the simple symmetry of the two-generator case.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{10}\n$$", "id": "3091043"}]}
