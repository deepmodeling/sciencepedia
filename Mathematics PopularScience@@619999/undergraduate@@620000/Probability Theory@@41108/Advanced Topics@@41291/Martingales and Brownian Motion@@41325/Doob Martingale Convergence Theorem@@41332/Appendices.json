You are given a stochastic process that is explicitly defined as a martingale, and your task is to calculate a conditional probability related to its future behavior. This practice will help you build intuition for how the abstract properties of a martingale translate into tangible probabilistic statements about the underlying random variables [@problem_id:1359203].", "problem": "Consider a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables $X_1, X_2, \\ldots$, drawn from a uniform distribution on the interval $[0, \\theta]$, where $\\theta > 0$ is a fixed parameter. Let $M_n = \\max\\{X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n\\}$ be the running maximum of the sequence.\n\nA stochastic process $Y_n$, for $n \\ge 1$, is constructed using a known constant $c$ such that $0 < c < 1$. The process is defined as:\n$$ Y_n = \\left(\\frac{1}{c}\\right)^n \\cdot I(M_n \\le c\\theta) $$\nwhere $I(A)$ is the indicator function that equals 1 if event $A$ is true, and 0 otherwise.

Express your answer as a function of $c$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the conditional probability $P(Y_5 = 0 | Y_3 > 0)$.\n\nFirst, let's translate the events involving the process $Y_n$ into events involving the running maximum $M_n$.\nThe definition of the process is $Y_n = (1/c)^n \\cdot I(M_n \\le c\\theta)$. Since $c \\in (0,1)$, the term $(1/c)^n$ is always positive.\nTherefore, the value of $Y_n$ is zero if and only if the indicator function is zero.\n- The event $\\{Y_3 > 0\\}$ is equivalent to the event $\\{I(M_3 \\le c\\theta) = 1\\}$, which simplifies to $\\{M_3 \\le c\\theta\\}$.\n- The event $\\{Y_5 = 0\\}$ is equivalent to the event $\\{I(M_5 \\le c\\theta) = 0\\}$, which simplifies to $\\{M_5 > c\\theta\\}$. The problem asks for the probability that the process becomes zero *at or before* time $n=5$. This means we are interested in the event that the process is zero at time $n=4$ or at time $n=5$ (if it wasn't already zero at $n=4$). Let's analyze the event. The process $Y_n$ can only transition from a non-zero value to zero. Once it is zero, it stays zero, because if $M_k > c\\theta$ for some $k$, then for all $n \\ge k$, $M_n = \\max(M_k, X_{k+1}, \\dots, X_n) \\ge M_k > c\\theta$, which implies $Y_n=0$. Therefore, the event \"the process will become zero at or before time $n=5$\" is simply $\\{Y_5=0\\}$, which is $\\{M_5 > c\\theta\\}$.\n\nSo, the quantity we need to compute is $P(M_5 > c\\theta | M_3 \\le c\\theta)$.\n\nUsing the rule for conditional probability, it is often easier to compute the probability of the complement event:\n$$ P(M_5 > c\\theta | M_3 \\le c\\theta) = 1 - P(M_5 \\le c\\theta | M_3 \\le c\\theta) $$\n\nNow, let's evaluate the conditional probability $P(M_5 \\le c\\theta | M_3 \\le c\\theta)$. By definition:\n$$ P(M_5 \\le c\\theta | M_3 \\le c\\theta) = \\frac{P(\\{M_5 \\le c\\theta\\} \\cap \\{M_3 \\le c\\theta\\})}{P(M_3 \\le c\\theta)} $$\n\nLet's analyze the event in the numerator, $\\{M_5 \\le c\\theta\\} \\cap \\{M_3 \\le c\\theta\\}$.\nThe condition $M_5 \\le c\\theta$ means that $\\max\\{X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4, X_5\\} \\le c\\theta$. This implies that $X_i \\le c\\theta$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$.\nIf all of the first five variables are less than or equal to $c\\theta$, then it is necessarily true that the maximum of the first three, $M_3 = \\max\\{X_1, X_2, X_3\\}$, is also less than or equal to $c\\theta$.\nIn other words, the event $\\{M_5 \\le c\\theta\\}$ is a subset of the event $\\{M_3 \\le c\\theta\\}$, i.e., $\\{M_5 \\le c\\theta\\} \\subseteq \\{M_3 \\le c\\theta\\}$.\nTherefore, their intersection is just the smaller event: $\\{M_5 \\le c\\theta\\} \\cap \\{M_3 \\le c\\theta\\} = \\{M_5 \\le c\\theta\\}$.\n\nSo the conditional probability simplifies to:\n$$ P(M_5 \\le c\\theta | M_3 \\le c\\theta) = \\frac{P(M_5 \\le c\\theta)}{P(M_3 \\le c\\theta)} $$\n\nNext, we need to calculate the probability $P(M_n \\le c\\theta)$ for a general $n$.\nThe event $M_n \\le c\\theta$ is equivalent to the event that all $n$ random variables $X_1, \\ldots, X_n$ are less than or equal to $c\\theta$.\n$$ P(M_n \\le c\\theta) = P(X_1 \\le c\\theta, X_2 \\le c\\theta, \\ldots, X_n \\le c\\theta) $$\nSince the random variables $X_i$ are independent and identically distributed, this is:\n$$ P(M_n \\le c\\theta) = \\left(P(X_1 \\le c\\theta)\\right)^n $$\nFor a single random variable $X_1 \\sim U[0, \\theta]$, the probability is:\n$$ P(X_1 \\le c\\theta) = \\frac{\\text{length of } [0, c\\theta]}{\\text{length of } [0, \\theta]} = \\frac{c\\theta}{\\theta} = c $$\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n$$ P(M_n \\le c\\theta) = c^n $$\n\nNow we can calculate the conditional probability:\n$$ P(M_5 \\le c\\theta | M_3 \\le c\\theta) = \\frac{P(M_5 \\le c\\theta)}{P(M_3 \\le c\\theta)} = \\frac{c^5}{c^3} = c^2 $$\n\nFinally, we can find the desired probability:\n$$ P(M_5 > c\\theta | M_3 \\le c\\theta) = 1 - P(M_5 \\le c\\theta | M_3 \\le c\\theta) = 1 - c^2 $$\nThis is the conditional probability that the process will be zero at or before time $n=5$, given it was non-zero at time $n=3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1-c^{2}}$$", "id": "1359203"}, {"introduction": "We now move to a classic application of martingale theory: the study of branching processes.

For this process, a bacterium cannot remain as a single entity; it must either perish or divide, so $p+q=1$. Each bacterium in the colony behaves independently and according to these same probabilities. The colony is considered to have survived if its population does not go to zero in the long run. Assume that the probability of splitting, $p$, is strictly greater than the probability of perishing, $q$.\n\nDetermine the long-term probability that the initial bacterium gives rise to a colony that survives indefinitely.

By the branching property and independence, extinction occurs either immediately (with probability $q$) or, if the initial bacterium splits (with probability $p$), if both descendant lineages go extinct independently, which has probability $s^{2}$.
