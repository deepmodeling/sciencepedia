The velocity components are $\\frac{dr}{dt} = 0$ and $\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = \\omega$. The acceleration components of the coordinate functions are $\\frac{d^{2}r}{dt^{2}} = 0$ and $\\frac{d^{2}\\theta}{dt^{2}} = 0$.\n\n    Let's examine the geodesic equation for the radial component, $k=r$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d^{2}r}{dt^{2}} + \\Gamma^{r}_{rr}\\left(\\frac{dr}{dt}\\right)^{2} + 2\\Gamma^{r}_{r\\theta}\\frac{dr}{dt}\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\Gamma^{r}_{\\theta\\theta}\\left(\\frac{d\\theta}{dt}\\right)^{2} = 0\n    $$\n    Substituting the values for the circular path:\n    $$\n    0 + \\Gamma^{r}_{rr}(0)^{2} + 2\\Gamma^{r}_{r\\theta}(0)(\\omega) + \\Gamma^{r}_{\\theta\\theta}(\\omega)^{2} = 0\n    $$\n    This simplifies to:\n    $$\n    \\Gamma^{r}_{\\theta\\theta}\\,\\omega^{2} = 0\n    $$\n    Using our calculated value $\\Gamma^{r}_{\\theta\\theta} = -r_{0}$, the equation becomes:\n    $$\n    -r_{0}\\omega^{2} = 0\n    $$\n    For a circle of non-zero radius ($r_{0} > 0$) and a non-trivial path ($\\omega \\neq 0$), this equation is not satisfied. The failure of the circle to satisfy the geodesic equation is entirely due to the non-zero Christoffel symbol $\\Gamma^{r}_{\\theta\\theta}$. Geometrically, this term represents the inward radial acceleration (centripetal acceleration) required to keep a particle on a circular path. In a curved coordinate system, even for a flat space, geodesics are straight lines. A circle is not a straight line, so it requires acceleration to follow, and thus is not a geodesic. The term $\\Gamma^{r}_{\\theta\\theta}(\\frac{d\\theta}{dt})^{2}$ quantifies this required \"fictitious\" acceleration arising from the choice of coordinates.\n\n2.  **Parallel transport of a vector along a radial ray:**\n    The parallel transport equation for a vector field $V^{k}$ along a curve $x^{j}(t)$ is:\n    $$\n    \\frac{dV^{k}}{dt} + \\Gamma^{k}_{\\;ij}\\,V^{i}\\,\\frac{dx^{j}}{dt} = 0\n    $$\n    A radial ray is given by $\\theta(t) = \\theta_{0}$ (constant) and $r(t) = t$. We can use $r$ as the parameter, so that $t=r$. The velocity components are $\\frac{dr}{dr} = 1$ and $\\frac{d\\theta}{dr} = 0$.\n    The parallel transport equations become:\n    $$\n    \\frac{dV^{k}}{dr} + \\Gamma^{k}_{\\;ij}\\,V^{i}\\,\\frac{dx^{j}}{dr} = 0\n    $$\n    Since $\\frac{dx^{j}}{dr}$ is non-zero only for $j=r$, this simplifies to:\n    $$\n    \\frac{dV^{k}}{dr} + \\Gamma^{k}_{\\;ir}\\,V^{i} = 0\n    $$\n    Let's consider the component for $k=\\theta$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{dV^{\\theta}}{dr} + \\Gamma^{\\theta}_{rr}V^{r} + \\Gamma^{\\theta}_{\\theta r}V^{\\theta} = 0\n    $$\n    The Christoffel symbol $\\Gamma^{\\theta}_{rr}$ is $0$. By symmetry of the lower indices, $\\Gamma^{\\theta}_{\\theta r} = \\Gamma^{\\theta}_{r\\theta} = \\frac{1}{r}$. The equation becomes:\n    $$\n    \\frac{dV^{\\theta}}{dr} + \\frac{1}{r}V^{\\theta} = 0\n    $$\n    This is a separable first-order ordinary differential equation: $\\frac{dV^{\\theta}}{V^{\\theta}} = -\\frac{dr}{r}$. Integrating yields $\\ln|V^{\\theta}| = -\\ln|r| + C$, which implies $|V^{\\theta}| \\propto \\frac{1}{r}$.\n    This means that as a vector is parallel-transported radially outward (increasing $r$), its angular coordinate component $V^{\\theta}$ must decrease proportionally to $1/r$. The geometric reason is that the coordinate basis vector $\\partial_{\\theta}$ is not of constant length; its magnitude is $|\\partial_{\\theta}| = \\sqrt{g_{\\theta\\theta}} = r$. As $r$ increases, the basis vector $\\partial_{\\theta}$ stretches. For the physical vector $V = V^{r}\\partial_{r} + V^{\\theta}\\partial_{\\theta}$ to remain parallel (i.e., fixed in orientation in the flat Euclidean plane), its component $V^{\\theta}$ must decrease to compensate for the increasing length of the basis vector $\\partial_{\\theta}$. The Christoffel symbol $\\Gamma^{\\theta}_{r\\theta} = \\frac{1}{r}$ precisely quantifies this rescaling effect due to the geometry of the polar coordinate system.\n\nThe calculated values for the Christoffel symbols are $\\Gamma^{\\theta}_{\\;r\\theta} = \\frac{1}{r}$ and $\\Gamma^{r}_{\\;\\theta\\theta} = -r$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{r} & -r \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3058768"}, {"introduction": "Having developed an intuition for Christoffel symbols in a flat space with curved coordinates, we now apply this machinery to a surface with intrinsic curvature: the unit sphere.
