No rounding is necessary.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is a well-defined mathematical exercise in finite group theory and representation theory, resting on standard definitions and providing all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nWe will proceed by addressing the four parts of the problem in sequential order.\n\nLet $G$ be the symmetric group $S_3$, whose elements in cycle notation are $\\{e, (12), (13), (23), (123), (132)\\}$. The subgroups are given as $H_1 = \\{e, (12)\\}$ and $H_2 = \\{e, (23)\\}$.\n\n**Part 1: Conjugacy and the map $\\varphi$**\n\nFirst, we must show that $H_2 = a H_1 a^{-1}$ for $a = (123) \\in S_3$. The inverse of $a$ is $a^{-1} = (123)^2 = (132)$. The set $a H_1 a^{-1}$ is $\\{a h a^{-1} \\mid h \\in H_1\\}$.\nFor $h = e$, we have $a e a^{-1} = e$.\nFor $h = (12)$, we compute the conjugate:\n$$a (12) a^{-1} = (123)(12)(132)$$\nTo evaluate this product, we track the action on the set $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$:\n- For the element $1$: $(132)$ sends $1 \\to 3$, $(12)$ fixes $3$, and $(123)$ sends $3 \\to 1$. So $1$ is a fixed point.\n- For the element $2$: $(132)$ sends $2 \\to 1$, $(12)$ sends $1 \\to 2$, and $(123)$ sends $2 \\to 3$. So $2 \\to 3$.\n- For the element $3$: $(132)$ sends $3 \\to 2$, $(12)$ sends $2 \\to 1$, and $(123)$ sends $1 \\to 2$. So $3 \\to 2$.\nThe resulting permutation is $(23)$.\nThus, $a H_1 a^{-1} = \\{e, (23)\\}$, which is precisely $H_2$.\n\nNext, we analyze the map $\\varphi: G/H_1 \\to G/H_2$ defined by $\\varphi(gH_1) = g a^{-1} H_2$.\nTo prove that $\\varphi$ is well-defined, we must show that if $g_1 H_1 = g_2 H_1$, then $g_1 a^{-1} H_2 = g_2 a^{-1} H_2$.\nThe condition $g_1 H_1 = g_2 H_1$ is equivalent to $g_2^{-1} g_1 \\in H_1$.\nThe conclusion $g_1 a^{-1} H_2 = g_2 a^{-1} H_2$ is equivalent to $(g_2 a^{-1})^{-1} (g_1 a^{-1}) \\in H_2$.\nLet's compute this element:\n$$(g_2 a^{-1})^{-1} (g_1 a^{-1}) = (a g_2^{-1}) (g_1 a^{-1}) = a (g_2^{-1} g_1) a^{-1}$$\nSince we are given $g_2^{-1} g_1 \\in H_1$, the resulting element $a(g_2^{-1} g_1)a^{-1}$ must be in the set $a H_1 a^{-1}$. As we have just shown, $a H_1 a^{-1} = H_2$. Therefore, $a(g_2^{-1}g_1)a^{-1} \\in H_2$, which proves that $\\varphi$ is well-defined.\n\nTo prove that $\\varphi$ is $G$-equivariant, we must show that for any $k \\in G$, $\\varphi(k \\cdot (gH_1)) = k \\cdot \\varphi(gH_1)$. The action is left multiplication.\nThe left-hand side is $\\varphi((kg)H_1) = (kg)a^{-1}H_2$.\nThe right-hand side is $k \\cdot \\varphi(gH_1) = k \\cdot (ga^{-1}H_2) = (k(ga^{-1}))H_2 = (kga^{-1})H_2$.\nThe left-hand side and right-hand side are equal, so $\\varphi$ is a $G$-equivariant map.\nSince $H_1$ and $H_2$ have the same order ($2$), the quotient spaces $G/H_1$ and $G/H_2$ have the same cardinality, $|G|/|H_1| = 6/2 = 3$. An equivariant map between $G$-sets of the same finite-size is a bijection if and only if it is injective or surjective. We can show injectivity: suppose $\\varphi(g_1H_1) = \\varphi(g_2H_1)$. This means $g_1a^{-1}H_2 = g_2a^{-1}H_2$, which implies $a(g_2^{-1}g_1)a^{-1} \\in H_2$. Since $H_2=aH_1a^{-1}$, this is equivalent to $g_2^{-1}g_1 \\in H_1$, which means $g_1H_1=g_2H_1$. Thus $\\varphi$ is injective and therefore a bijection.\n\n**Part 2: The transplantation operator $T$**\n\nThe operator $T: \\mathbb{C}^{G/H_1} \\to \\mathbb{C}^{G/H_2}$ is defined by $T(f) = f \\circ \\varphi^{-1}$. We must show that $T$ is a $G$-intertwiner, meaning $T(g \\cdot f) = g \\cdot T(f)$ for all $g \\in G$ and $f \\in \\mathbb{C}^{G/H_1}$.\nLet $y$ be an element in the set $G/H_2$. The action of $G$ on a function $h$ is defined by $(g \\cdot h)(x) = h(g^{-1} \\cdot x)$.\nWe evaluate the left-hand side at $y$:\n$$[T(g \\cdot f)](y) = ((g \\cdot f) \\circ \\varphi^{-1})(y) = (g \\cdot f)(\\varphi^{-1}(y)) = f(g^{-1} \\cdot \\varphi^{-1}(y))$$\nWe evaluate the right-hand side at $y$:\n$$[g \\cdot T(f)](y) = (T(f))(g^{-1} \\cdot y) = (f \\circ \\varphi^{-1})(g^{-1} \\cdot y) = f(\\varphi^{-1}(g^{-1} \\cdot y))$$\nSince $\\varphi$ is a $G$-equivariant map, its inverse $\\varphi^{-1}$ is also $G$-equivariant. That is, $\\varphi^{-1}(g^{-1} \\cdot y) = g^{-1} \\cdot \\varphi^{-1}(y)$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for the right-hand side gives $f(g^{-1} \\cdot \\varphi^{-1}(y))$.\nThe left-hand side and the right-hand side are identical for any $y \\in G/H_2$, so the functions are equal: $T(g \\cdot f) = g \\cdot T(f)$.\n\n**Part 3 and 4: Matrix of $T$ and its determinant**\n\nWe need to find the matrix representation of $T$ with respect to the given ordered bases.\nLet the basis for $\\mathbb{C}^{G/H_1}$ be $\\mathcal{B}_1 = \\{\\delta_{x_1}, \\delta_{x_2}, \\delta_{x_3}\\}$, where $x_1 = eH_1$, $x_2 = (13)H_1$, and $x_3 = (23)H_1$.\nLet the basis for $\\mathbb{C}^{G/H_2}$ be $\\mathcal{B}_2 = \\{\\delta_{y_1}, \\delta_{y_2}, \\delta_{y_3}\\}$, where $y_1 = eH_2$, $y_2 = (12)H_2$, and $y_3 = (13)H_2$.\nThe action of $T$ on a basis vector $\\delta_{x_j}$ is:\n$$T(\\delta_{x_j}) = \\delta_{x_j} \\circ \\varphi^{-1}$$\nFor any $y \\in G/H_2$, $[T(\\delta_{x_j})](y) = \\delta_{x_j}(\\varphi^{-1}(y))$. This value is $1$ if $\\varphi^{-1}(y) = x_j$ (i.e., $y = \\varphi(x_j)$) and $0$ otherwise. This means $T(\\delta_{x_j}) = \\delta_{\\varphi(x_j)}$.\nThe $j$-th column of the matrix of $T$ is the coordinate vector of $T(\\delta_{x_j})$ with respect to the basis $\\mathcal{B}_2$. We must compute $\\varphi(x_j)$ for $j=1, 2, 3$ and identify the result with one of the $y_i$.\nRecall $\\varphi(gH_1) = g a^{-1} H_2 = g(132)H_2$.\n\n- For $j=1$, $x_1 = eH_1$:\n$\\varphi(x_1) = e(132)H_2 = (132)H_2$. We check which $y_i$ this corresponds to. The cosets for $H_2$ are: $y_1=eH_2=\\{e, (23)\\}$, $y_2=(12)H_2=\\{(12), (123)\\}$, and $y_3=(13)H_2=\\{(13), (132)\\}$. Since $(132) \\in (13)H_2$, we have $\\varphi(x_1) = (13)H_2 = y_3$.\n\n- For $j=2$, $x_2 = (13)H_1$:\n$\\varphi(x_2) = (13)(132)H_2$. The product is $(13)(132)=(23)$. So $\\varphi(x_2) = (23)H_2$. Since $(23) \\in H_2$, this coset is $eH_2 = y_1$.\n\n- For $j=3$, $x_3 = (23)H_1$:\n$\\varphi(x_3) = (23)(132)H_2$. The product is $(23)(132)=(12)$. So $\\varphi(x_3) = (12)H_2 = y_2$.\n\nSo, we have the following mapping of basis vectors:\n$T(\\delta_{x_1}) = \\delta_{y_3}$\n$T(\\delta_{x_2}) = \\delta_{y_1}$\n$T(\\delta_{x_3}) = \\delta_{y_2}$\n\nWe can now construct the matrix $M_T$ of $T$. The $j$-th column is the representation of $T(\\delta_{x_j})$ in the basis $\\{\\delta_{y_1}, \\delta_{y_2}, \\delta_{y_3}\\}$.\n- Column 1 ($j=1$): $T(\\delta_{x_1}) = \\delta_{y_3} = 0 \\cdot \\delta_{y_1} + 0 \\cdot \\delta_{y_2} + 1 \\cdot \\delta_{y_3}$. The column is $(0, 0, 1)^T$.\n- Column 2 ($j=2$): $T(\\delta_{x_2}) = \\delta_{y_1} = 1 \\cdot \\delta_{y_1} + 0 \\cdot \\delta_{y_2} + 0 \\cdot \\delta_{y_3}$. The column is $(1, 0, 0)^T$.\n- Column 3 ($j=3$): $T(\\delta_{x_3}) = \\delta_{y_2} = 0 \\cdot \\delta_{y_1} + 1 \\cdot \\delta_{y_2} + 0 \\cdot \\delta_{y_3}$. The column is $(0, 1, 0)^T$.\n\nThe matrix $M_T$ is:\n$$\nM_T = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the determinant of this $3 \\times 3$ matrix. Using the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion:\n$$\\det(M_T) = (0 \\cdot 0 \\cdot 0) + (1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1) + (0 \\cdot 0 \\cdot 0) - (0 \\cdot 0 \\cdot 1) - (1 \\cdot 0 \\cdot 0) - (0 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 0) = 0 + 1 + 0 - 0 - 0 - 0 = 1$$\nAlternatively, this is the permutation matrix for the permutation $\\pi$ on $\\{1,2,3\\}$ given by $\\pi(1)=3$, $\\pi(2)=1$, $\\pi(3)=2$, which is the cycle $(132)$.

Let us adopt the provided notation $N_{H}(C) := |C \\cap H|$. With this notation, Sunada's condition is succinctly expressed as $N_{H_{1}}(C) = N_{H_{2}}(C)$ for all conjugacy classes $C$ of $G$.\n\nThe diagnostic quantity is defined as\n$$\nS = \\sum_{C} \\bigl( N_{H_{1}}(C) - N_{H_{2}}(C) \\bigr)^{2}\n$$\nwhere the summation is taken over all distinct conjugacy classes $C$ of the group $G$.\n\nWe must establish that $S=0$ if and only if Sunada's condition is satisfied.

By definition, this means that for every conjugacy class $C$, we have $N_{H_{1}}(C) = N_{H_{2}}(C)$. This implies that the difference $N_{H_{1}}(C) - N_{H_{2}}(C)$ is equal to $0$ for every $C$. Substituting this into the formula for $S$ gives:\n$$\nS = \\sum_{C} (0)^{2} = \\sum_{C} 0 = 0\n$$\nThus, if Sunada's condition is met, then $S=0$.\n\n($\\implies$) Assume that $S=0$. The quantity $S$ is a sum of terms of the form $\\bigl( N_{H_{1}}(C) - N_{H_{2}}(C) \\bigr)^{2}$. The number of elements $N_{H}(C)$ is, by its definition as a cardinality, a non-negative integer. Therefore, the difference $N_{H_{1}}(C) - N_{H_{2}}(C)$ is an integer. Its square, $\\bigl( N_{H_{1}}(C) - N_{H_{2}}(C) \\bigr)^{2}$, is a non-negative real number (specifically, a non-negative integer). A sum of non-negative terms is equal to zero if and only if each term in the sum is individually equal to zero.\nTherefore, the condition $S=0$ implies that for every conjugacy class $C$:\n$$\n\\bigl( N_{H_{1}}(C) - N_{H_{2}}(C) \\bigr)^{2} = 0\n$$\nTaking the square root of both sides, we find that for every $C$:\n$$\nN_{H_{1}}(C) - N_{H_{2}}(C) = 0\n$$\nwhich is equivalent to $N_{H_{1}}(C) = N_{H_{2}}(C)$.

Observe that $\\operatorname{vol}(M_1) = \\operatorname{vol}(M_2)$ and that the scalar Laplace–Beltrami spectra are equal; conclude that $M_1$ and $M_2$ are not isometric.", "solution": "The problem asks to identify which of the given checks, upon yielding the specified outcome, provides a logically sufficient proof that the manifolds $M_1 = X / H_1$ and $M_2 = X / H_2$ are not isometric. The manifolds $M_1$ and $M_2$ are constructed using Sunada's method, which guarantees they are isospectral. We are given that $X$ is a closed, connected Riemannian manifold of strictly negative sectional curvature. The quotients $M_1$ and $M_2$ by free isometric actions of finite groups $H_1, H_2 \\subset G$ are therefore also closed, connected Riemannian manifolds of strictly negative sectional curvature.\n\nLet us analyze each option based on established principles of geometry and topology. An isometry is a diffeomorphism that preserves the Riemannian metric. Any isometry is a diffeomorphism, and any diffeomorphism is a homeomorphism. Therefore, if two manifolds are isometric, they must also be diffeomorphic and homeomorphic, and must share all invariants associated with these weaker structures.\n\n**A. Prove that $H_1$ and $H_2$ are not conjugate in $G$ and conclude that $M_1$ and $M_2$ are not isometric.**\n\nThis proposes the implication: ($H_1$ and $H_2$ are not conjugate in $G$) $\\implies$ ($M_1$ and $M_2$ are not isometric).\nLet's analyze the relationship between conjugacy of the subgroups and isometry of the quotient manifolds. If $H_1$ and $H_2$ are conjugate in $G$, there exists an element $g \\in G$ such that $H_2 = gH_1g^{-1}$. Since $g \\in G$, it acts as an isometry on $X$. The map $\\phi_g: X \\to X$ given by $x \\mapsto g \\cdot x$ descends to a well-defined map $F: M_1 \\to M_2$ given by $F(H_1x) = H_2(gx)$. This map is an isometry because the metrics on $M_1$ and $M_2$ are induced from the metric on $X$, which is preserved by the action of $g$. Thus, if $H_1$ and $H_2$ are conjugate in $G$, then $M_1$ and $M_2$ are isometric.\n\nThe statement in option A is the converse of the contrapositive of this fact. It suggests that if $H_1$ and $H_2$ are not conjugate in $G$, then $M_1$ and $M_2$ cannot be isometric. This is not necessarily true. An isometry $\\phi: M_1 \\to M_2$ can be lifted to an isometry $\\tilde{\\phi}: X \\to X$ which conjugates the deck transformation groups, i.e., $\\tilde{\\phi} H_1 \\tilde{\\phi}^{-1} = H_2$. This means $H_1$ and $H_2$ must be conjugate in the full isometry group $\\operatorname{Isom}(X)$. However, the lifting isometry $\\tilde{\\phi}$ is not guaranteed to be an element of the prescribed finite subgroup $G$. It is possible for $H_1$ and $H_2$ to be non-conjugate in $G$ but conjugate in the larger group $\\operatorname{Isom}(X)$, leading to isometric manifolds $M_1$ and $M_2$. In fact, examples exist where Sunada's construction with non-conjugate subgroups in $G$ yields isometric manifolds. Therefore, proving that $H_1$ and $H_2$ are not conjugate in $G$ is insufficient to conclude that $M_1$ and $M_2$ are not isometric.\n\nVerdict for A: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Prove that $\\pi_1(M_1)$ and $\\pi_1(M_2)$ are not isomorphic as groups and conclude that $M_1$ and $M_2$ are not isometric.**\n\nThis proposes the implication: ($\\pi_1(M_1) \\not\\cong \\pi_1(M_2)$) $\\implies$ ($M_1$ and $M_2$ are not isometric).\nThe fundamental group $\\pi_1(M)$ is a topological invariant. A homeomorphism $f: M_1 \\to M_2$ induces a group isomorphism $f_*: \\pi_1(M_1) \\to \\pi_1(M_2)$. Since an isometry is a specific type of homeomorphism, if $M_1$ and $M_2$ are isometric, they must be homeomorphic, and therefore their fundamental groups must be isomorphic.\nThe logical contrapositive of this statement is: if the fundamental groups $\\pi_1(M_1)$ and $\\pi_1(M_2)$ are not isomorphic, then there cannot be a homeomorphism between $M_1$ and $M_2$. If there is no homeomorphism, there can be no diffeomorphism, and certainly no isometry.\nThus, proving that $\\pi_1(M_1)$ and $\\pi_1(M_2)$ are not isomorphic is a valid and definitive method for proving that $M_1$ and $M_2$ are not isometric. Such situations can arise in Sunada's construction. For example, if one takes $H_1$ and $H_2$ to be non-isomorphic (but almost conjugate) groups, this can lead to non-isomorphic fundamental groups for the quotients $M_1$ and $M_2$.\n\nVerdict for B: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Compute and compare the Marked Length Spectra of $M_1$ and $M_2$; if the MLS functions differ, conclude that $M_1$ and $M_2$ are not isometric.**\n\nThis proposes the implication: ($\\operatorname{MLS}(M_1) \\neq \\operatorname{MLS}(M_2)$) $\\implies$ ($M_1$ and $M_2$ are not isometric).\nThe problem statement provides the crucial fact that for closed, negatively curved manifolds, equality of the Marked Length Spectrum (MLS) implies isometry. Let's write this as: ($\\operatorname{MLS}(M_1) = \\operatorname{MLS}(M_2)$) $\\implies$ ($M_1$ and $M_2$ are isometric).\nThe proposed check in this option is the logical contrapositive of this fact. If we assume $M_1$ and $M_2$ were isometric, then their MLS would have to be equal. Therefore, if their MLS are found to be different, they cannot be isometric.\nThe manifolds $M_1$ and $M_2$ are quotients of a negatively curved closed manifold $X$ by free isometric actions, so they are themselves closed manifolds of strictly negative sectional curvature. Thus, they fall into the class of manifolds for which this deep theorem holds. Comparing their MLS is therefore a valid test for non-isometry. It is a standard method to distinguish between isospectral manifolds produced by Sunada's construction.\n\nVerdict for C: **Correct**.\n\n**D. Observe that $\\operatorname{vol}(M_1) = \\operatorname{vol}(M_2)$ and that the scalar Laplace–Beltrami spectra are equal; conclude that $M_1$ and $M_2$ are not isometric.**\n\nThis proposes the implication: ($\\operatorname{spec}(M_1) = \\operatorname{spec}(M_2)$ and $\\operatorname{vol}(M_1) = \\operatorname{vol}(M_2)$) $\\implies$ ($M_1$ and $M_2$ are not isometric).\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. The premises of this implication are direct consequences of Sunada's construction as stated in the problem description. Sunada's theorem guarantees isospectrality, and Weyl's law (a consequence of heat trace asymptotics) then implies that the volumes are equal. These are starting points, defining the very nature of the pair $(M_1, M_2)$.\nThe conclusion drawn is non-isometry. However, if two manifolds are isometric, they are necessarily isospectral and have the same volume. For a trivial example, let $H_1 = H_2$; then $M_1=M_2$. They are isometric, isospectral, and have equal volume, which directly contradicts the proposed implication. The entire challenge posed by \"hearing the shape of a drum\" is that the conditions of being isospectral and having equal volume are not sufficient to guarantee isometry. This option incorrectly suggests that these conditions are sufficient to prove non-isometry, which is the logical opposite of the truth.\n\nVerdict for D: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BC}$$", "id": "3064319"}]}
