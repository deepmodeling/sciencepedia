I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the time-dependent radius $r(t)$ of a $3$-sphere, $\\mathbb{S}^{3}$, whose metric $g(t)$ evolves under the unnormalized Ricci flow.\n\nThe Ricci flow equation is given by:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} g(t) = -2\\,\\operatorname{Ric}(g(t))\n$$\n\nThe metric is assumed to retain its spherical symmetry for all time $t \\ge 0$, with the form:\n$$\ng(t) = r(t)^{2}\\,g_{\\mathrm{can}}\n$$\nwhere $g_{\\mathrm{can}}$ is the time-independent standard metric on the unit sphere $\\mathbb{S}^{3}$.\n\nWe will substitute this form of the metric into the Ricci flow equation. First, we compute the left-hand side (LHS), which is the time derivative of the metric tensor:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} g(t) = \\partial_{t} \\left( r(t)^{2}\\,g_{\\mathrm{can}} \\right)\n$$\nSince $g_{\\mathrm{can}}$ is independent of time, the derivative acts only on the scalar function $r(t)^{2}$:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} g(t) = \\left( \\frac{d}{dt}r(t)^{2} \\right) g_{\\mathrm{can}} = \\left( 2\\,r(t)\\,\\frac{dr}{dt} \\right) g_{\\mathrm{can}}\n$$\nLet us denote $\\frac{dr}{dt}$ by $r'(t)$. The LHS is then:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} g(t) = 2\\,r(t)\\,r'(t)\\,g_{\\mathrm{can}}\n$$\n\nNext, we evaluate the right-hand side (RHS) of the Ricci flow equation. The problem provides the formula for the Ricci tensor of a round $3$-sphere with metric $g$ and radius $r$:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ric}(g) = \\frac{2}{r^{2}}\\,g\n$$\nIn our case, the metric at time $t$ is $g(t)$ and the radius is $r(t)$. Therefore, the Ricci tensor at time $t$ is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ric}(g(t)) = \\frac{2}{r(t)^{2}}\\,g(t)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $g(t) = r(t)^{2}\\,g_{\\mathrm{can}}$ into this formula, we get:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Ric}(g(t)) = \\frac{2}{r(t)^{2}}\\,(r(t)^{2}\\,g_{\\mathrm{can}}) = 2\\,g_{\\mathrm{can}}\n$$\nNow, the RHS of the Ricci flow equation is $-2\\,\\operatorname{Ric}(g(t))$:\n$$\n-2\\,\\operatorname{Ric}(g(t)) = -2\\,(2\\,g_{\\mathrm{can}}) = -4\\,g_{\\mathrm{can}}\n$$\n\nEquating the LHS and RHS, we have:\n$$\n2\\,r(t)\\,r'(t)\\,g_{\\mathrm{can}} = -4\\,g_{\\mathrm{can}}\n$$\nSince $g_{\\mathrm{can}}$ is a non-degenerate metric tensor, we can equate the scalar coefficients on both sides:\n$$\n2\\,r(t)\\,r'(t) = -4\n$$\nThis simplifies to the following ordinary differential equation for the radius $r(t)$:\n$$\nr(t)\\,\\frac{dr}{dt} = -2\n$$\n\nThis is a separable first-order ODE. We can write it as:\n$$\nr\\,dr = -2\\,dt\n$$\nTo find the solution $r(t)$, we integrate both sides. We integrate from the initial time $t=0$ to an arbitrary time $t$, and correspondingly from the initial radius $r(0)=r_{0}$ to the radius $r(t)$:\n$$\n\\int_{r_{0}}^{r(t)} r'\\,dr' = \\int_{0}^{t} -2\\,d\\tau\n$$\nPerforming the integration yields:\n$$\n\\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(r')^{2} \\right]_{r_{0}}^{r(t)} = \\left[ -2\\,\\tau \\right]_{0}^{t}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}r(t)^{2} - \\frac{1}{2}r_{0}^{2} = -2\\,t\n$$\nNow, we solve for $r(t)^{2}$:\n$$\nr(t)^{2} = r_{0}^{2} - 4\\,t\n$$\nSince the radius $r(t)$ must be positive, we take the positive square root:\n$$\nr(t) = \\sqrt{r_{0}^{2} - 4\\,t}\n$$\nThis expression describes the radius of the sphere as it evolves under Ricci flow.\n\nThe extinction time $T$ is the finite time at which the manifold shrinks to a point, meaning its radius becomes zero. We find $T$ by setting $r(T)=0$:\n$$\n0 = \\sqrt{r_{0}^{2} - 4\\,T}\n$$\nSquaring both sides gives:\n$$\n0 = r_{0}^{2} - 4\\,T\n$$\nSolving for $T$, we obtain:\n$$\n4\\,T = r_{0}^{2}\n$$\n$$\nT = \\frac{r_{0}^{2}}{4}\n$$\nThis is the finite time at which the sphere collapses to a point under the Ricci flow.

We proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe task is to derive the evolution equations for two geometric quantities: the scalar curvature $R$ and the Riemannian volume form $d\\mu$.

All tensorial objects are functions of time $t$, though this dependence is often suppressed for notational clarity.\n\nFirst, we derive the evolution of the volume form $d\\mu$.\nThe volume form is defined in local coordinates $(x^1, x^2, x^3)$ by $d\\mu = \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} \\, dx^1 \\wedge dx^2 \\wedge dx^3$. Since the coordinate system is fixed, the evolution of $d\\mu$ is determined by the evolution of the scalar factor $\\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})}$.

For a time-dependent invertible matrix $A(t)$, this formula states $\\partial_t(\\det A) = (\\det A) \\operatorname{tr}(A^{-1} \\partial_t A)$. Applying this to the metric tensor $g= (g_{ij})$, with its inverse $g^{-1} = (g^{ij})$, we have:\n$$\n\\partial_{t}(\\det(g_{ij})) = (\\det(g_{ij})) \\operatorname{tr}(g^{-1} \\partial_{t}g_{ij}) = (\\det(g_{ij})) g^{kl} (\\partial_{t}g_{kl})\n$$\nSubstituting this back into our expression for $\\partial_t \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})}$:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})}} \\left( (\\det(g_{ij})) g^{kl} (\\partial_{t}g_{kl}) \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} (g^{kl} \\partial_{t}g_{kl})\n$$\nNow we introduce the Ricci flow equation, $\\partial_t g_{ij} = -2\\operatorname{Ric}_{ij}$.\n$$\n\\partial_{t} \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} (g^{kl}(-2\\operatorname{Ric}_{kl})) = -\\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} (g^{kl}\\operatorname{Ric}_{kl})\n$$\nThe expression $g^{kl}\\operatorname{Ric}_{kl}$ is the definition of the scalar curvature $R$. Thus,\n$$\n\\partial_{t} \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} = -R \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})}\n$$\nThis directly gives the evolution of the volume form $d\\mu$:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} d\\mu = \\left(\\partial_{t} \\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})}\\right) dx^1 \\wedge dx^2 \\wedge dx^3 = (-R\\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})}) dx^1 \\wedge dx^2 \\wedge dx^3 = -R \\, d\\mu\n$$\nThe right-hand side of the evolution equation for $d\\mu$ is therefore $-R\\,d\\mu$.\n\nNext, we derive the evolution of the scalar curvature $R$.\nThe problem allows the use of the general first-variation formula for $R$ under a metric variation $v_{ij} = \\partial_t g_{ij}$. The standard form of this formula, consistent with the specified sign convention for the Laplacian $\\Delta = g^{ij}\\nabla_i\\nabla_j$, is:\n$$\n\\partial_t R = -\\Delta(\\operatorname{tr}_{g}v) + \\operatorname{div}(\\operatorname{div} v) - \\langle v, \\operatorname{Ric} \\rangle\n$$\nwhere $\\operatorname{tr}_g v = g^{ij}v_{ij}$, $\\operatorname{div}(\\operatorname{div} v) = \\nabla^i\\nabla^j v_{ij}$, and $\\langle v, \\operatorname{Ric} \\rangle = v_{ij}\\operatorname{Ric}^{ij}$. For the Ricci flow, we substitute $v_{ij} = -2\\operatorname{Ric}_{ij}$ and evaluate each term.\n\n1.  The trace term: The trace of the variation $v$ is\n    $$\n    \\operatorname{tr}_g v = g^{ij}v_{ij} = g^{ij}(-2\\operatorname{Ric}_{ij}) = -2(g^{ij}\\operatorname{Ric}_{ij}) = -2R\n    $$\n    The first term in the evolution equation is therefore $-\\Delta(\\operatorname{tr}_g v) = -\\Delta(-2R) = 2\\Delta R$.\n\n2.  The divergence term: The double divergence of $v$ is\n    $$\n    \\operatorname{div}(\\operatorname{div} v) = \\nabla^i \\nabla^j v_{ij} = \\nabla^i \\nabla^j (-2\\operatorname{Ric}_{ij}) = -2\\nabla^i(\\nabla^j \\operatorname{Ric}_{ij})\n    $$\n    We apply the contracted second Bianchi identity, given as $\\nabla^i \\operatorname{Ric}_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2}\\nabla_j R$. By relabeling indices, we have $\\nabla^j \\operatorname{Ric}_{ji} = \\frac{1}{2}\\nabla_i R$. Since the Ricci tensor is symmetric ($\\operatorname{Ric}_{ij} = \\operatorname{Ric}_{ji}$), this becomes $\\nabla^j \\operatorname{Ric}_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2}\\nabla_i R$. Substituting this into our expression:\n    $$\n    \\operatorname{div}(\\operatorname{div} v) = -2\\nabla^i\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla_i R\\right) = -\\nabla^i\\nabla_i R\n    $$\n    By raising the second index, $\\nabla^i\\nabla_i R = g^{ij}\\nabla_j\\nabla_i R$.

Therefore,\n    $$\n    \\operatorname{div}(\\operatorname{div} v) = -g^{ij}\\nabla_i\\nabla_j R = -\\Delta R\n    $$\n\n3.  The inner product term: The inner product of $v$ with the Ricci tensor is\n    $$\n    \\langle v, \\operatorname{Ric} \\rangle = v_{ij}\\operatorname{Ric}^{ij} = (-2\\operatorname{Ric}_{ij})\\operatorname{Ric}^{ij} = -2|\\operatorname{Ric}|^2\n    $$\n    where $|\\operatorname{Ric}|^2 = \\operatorname{Ric}_{ij}\\operatorname{Ric}^{ij}$ is the squared norm of the Ricci tensor.

This derivation holds in any dimension, and no further simplification based on the specific dimension $n=3$ is required by the problem statement, as the result is already in terms of fundamental geometric quantities.\n\nThe final answer requires the right-hand sides of the two derived evolution equations to be presented as entries in a single row matrix.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\Delta R + 2|\\operatorname{Ric}|^2 & -R \\, d\\mu \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2997867"}, {"introduction": "This final practice connects our geometric tools to a classic object in topology that underscores the subtlety of the Poincaré Conjecture.

We will proceed by addressing each of the three parts of the problem in order.\n\nPart 1: Action properties and the quotient manifold\n\nThe problem defines the manifold $S^{3}$ with its standard round metric of constant sectional curvature $1$. It is identified with the Lie group $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$. A finite subgroup $I^{*} \\subset \\mathrm{SU}(2)$, the binary icosahedral group of order $120$, acts on $S^{3}$ by left multiplication. We are asked to demonstrate that this action possesses certain properties and to characterize the resulting quotient space $M = S^{3}/I^{*}$.\n\n1.  Action by Isometries: The standard round metric on $S^{3}$ can be understood by viewing $S^{3}$ as the set of unit quaternions in $\\mathbb{H} \\cong \\mathbb{R}^{4}$. The distance between two points $q_{1}, q_{2} \\in S^{3}$ is induced by the Euclidean norm in $\\mathbb{R}^{4}$. The action of an element $g \\in I^{*} \\subset S^{3}$ on a point $x \\in S^{3}$ is given by left quaternion multiplication, $x \\mapsto gx$. The distance between two points $gx_{1}$ and $gx_{2}$ is given by $\\|gx_{1} - gx_{2}\\| = \\|g(x_{1}-x_{2})\\|$. Since $g$ is a unit quaternion, its norm $\\|g\\|$ is $1$. The norm is multiplicative, so $\\|g(x_{1}-x_{2})\\| = \\|g\\| \\|x_{1}-x_{2}\\| = \\|x_{1}-x_{2}\\|$. Thus, the action preserves distances and is therefore an action by isometries. More generally, the standard metric on $S^{3}$ is bi-invariant under the group operation of $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$, so left multiplication by any element is an isometry.\n\n2.  Free Action: An action of a group $G$ on a set $X$ is free if the stabilizer of every point is trivial. That is, if $g \\cdot x = x$ for some $x \\in X$, then $g$ must be the identity element $e \\in G$. For the action of $I^{*}$ on $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ by left multiplication, the condition $g \\cdot x = x$ translates to the group equation $gx = x$. Since $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ is a group, every element $x$ has an inverse $x^{-1}$. Multiplying by $x^{-1}$ on the right, we get $gxx^{-1} = xx^{-1}$, which implies $g = I$, where $I$ is the identity matrix in $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$. Thus, the only element of $I^{*}$ that fixes any point is the identity, so the action is free.\n\n3.  Properly Discontinuous Action: An action of a group $G$ on a topological space $X$ is properly discontinuous if for every $x \\in X$, there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ such that $g(U) \\cap U = \\emptyset$ for all $g \\in G$ with $g \\neq e$. A standard theorem states that the action of a finite group on a Hausdorff space is always properly discontinuous. Here, $I^{*}$ is a finite group of order $120$ and $S^{3}$ is a compact, and therefore Hausdorff, manifold. Thus, the action is properly discontinuous.\n\nConclusion on the quotient manifold $M=S^3/I^{*}$:\nA fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry states that if a group $\\Gamma$ acts freely, properly discontinuously, and by isometries on a Riemannian manifold $(N, g)$, then the quotient space $N/\\Gamma$ admits a unique Riemannian manifold structure for which the projection map $\\pi : N \\to N/\\Gamma$ is a local isometry.\nApplying this theorem to our case, $M = S^{3}/I^{*}$ is a Riemannian $3$-manifold.\n-   $M$ is closed: As the continuous image of the compact space $S^3$, the quotient space $M$ is compact. A compact manifold without boundary is termed a closed manifold.\n-   $M$ is oriented: The manifold $S^3$ is orientable. The group $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ is connected. Any element $g \\in I^{*} \\subset \\mathrm{SU}(2)$ is path-connected to the identity element. An isometry that is homotopic to the identity map must be orientation-preserving. Therefore, all elements of $I^*$ act as orientation-preserving isometries on $S^3$. Consequently, the quotient manifold $M$ is orientable.\n-   $M$ has constant sectional curvature $1$: The projection map $\\pi: S^{3} \\to M$ is a local isometry. Sectional curvature is a local property of the metric. Thus, $M$ inherits the constant sectional curvature of $S^3$, which is $1$.\n\nPart 2: Identification as the Poincaré homology sphere\n\nA manifold whose universal cover is the sphere $S^n$ is called a spherical space form.\n-   Universal Cover and Fundamental Group: By definition of the quotient topology, the projection $\\pi: S^{3} \\to S^{3}/I^{*}$ is a a covering map. Since $S^{3}$ is simply connected (i.e., $\\pi_1(S^3) = \\{e\\}$), it is the universal covering space of $M = S^{3}/I^{*}$. The theory of covering spaces establishes that for a quotient manifold $M = N/G$ where $N$ is the universal cover, the fundamental group of $M$ is isomorphic to the group of deck transformations, which is the group $G$ itself. Therefore, $\\pi_{1}(M) \\cong I^{*}$. The order of the fundamental group is $|I^{*}| = 120$.\n-   Poincaré Homology Sphere: A homology $n$-sphere is an $n$-manifold $X$ that has the same homology groups with integer coefficients as the $n$-sphere $S^n$. The Poincaré homology sphere is a specific example of a $3$-manifold which is a homology $3$-sphere but is not homeomorphic to $S^3$. A key distinguishing feature is that its fundamental group is non-trivial, whereas $\\pi_1(S^3)$ is trivial. Our manifold $M = S^{3}/I^{*}$ has $\\pi_1(M) \\cong I^{*}$, a non-trivial finite group of order $120$. This implies $M$ is not simply connected and therefore not homeomorphic to $S^{3}$. The verification that $M$ is a homology sphere requires calculating its homology groups, which is the task of the next part. The manifold $S^3/I^*$ is the canonical construction of the Poincaré homology sphere.\n\nPart 3: First homology group and Betti number\n\nWe are asked to compute the first homology group $H_{1}(S^{3}/I^{*}; \\mathbb{Z})$ and the corresponding first Betti number $b_{1}(S^{3}/I^{*})$.\n\n-   First Homology Group: A fundamental result in algebraic topology, often a consequence of the Hurewicz theorem, states that the first integer homology group of a path-connected topological space $X$ is isomorphic to the abelianization of its fundamental group. The abelianization of a group $G$, denoted $G_{\\text{ab}}$, is the quotient group $G/[G, G]$, where $[G, G]$ is the commutator subgroup of $G$.\n    For our manifold $M = S^{3}/I^{*}$, we have:\n    $$H_{1}(M; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong (\\pi_{1}(M))_{\\text{ab}}$$\n    From Part 2, we know $\\pi_{1}(M) \\cong I^{*}$. Thus, we need to compute the abelianization of the binary icosahedral group $I^{*}$:\n    $$H_{1}(S^{3}/I^{*}; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong (I^{*})_{\\text{ab}} = I^{*}/[I^{*}, I^{*}]$$\n-   Abelianization of $I^{*}$: The group $I^{*}$ is the binary icosahedral group, which is the preimage of the icosahedral group $I \\cong A_5$ under the double covering $p: \\mathrm{SU}(2) \\to \\mathrm{SO}(3)$. It is a standard result in the theory of finite groups that $I^{*}$ is isomorphic to the special linear group $\\mathrm{SL}(2, \\mathbb{F}_{5})$, the group of $2 \\times 2$ matrices with determinant $1$ over the finite field with $5$ elements.\n    A group $G$ is called a perfect group if it equals its own commutator subgroup, i.e., $G = [G, G]$. For a perfect group, the abelianization $G/[G, G]$ is the trivial group.\n    It is a well-known theorem in group theory that the group $\\mathrm{SL}(n, K)$ is perfect for any field $K$ and any $n \\geq 2$, with only two exceptions: $\\mathrm{SL}(2, \\mathbb{F}_{2})$ and $\\mathrm{SL}(2, \\mathbb{F}_{3})$.\n    Our group is $I^{*} \\cong \\mathrm{SL}(2, \\mathbb{F}_{5})$. Since this is not one of the two exceptions, the group is perfect.\n    Therefore, $[I^{*}, I^{*}] = I^{*}$.\n-   Calculation: The first homology group is:\n    $$H_{1}(S^{3}/I^{*}; \\mathbb{Z}) \\cong I^{*}/[I^{*}, I^{*}] = I^{*}/I^{*} \\cong \\{0\\}$$\n    The first homology group is the trivial group. This confirms that $S^3/I^*$ is a homology sphere, as $H_1(S^3;\\mathbb{Z})=0$.\n\n-   First Betti Number: The $k$-th Betti number of a topological space $X$, denoted $b_{k}(X)$, is defined as the rank of the $k$-th homology group $H_{k}(X; \\mathbb{Z})$. The rank of an abelian group is the dimension of the vector space obtained by tensoring it with $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n    The first Betti number is $b_{1}(S^{3}/I^{*}) = \\mathrm{rank}(H_{1}(S^{3}/I^{*}; \\mathbb{Z}))$.\n    Since $H_{1}(S^{3}/I^{*}; \\mathbb{Z})$ is the trivial group $\\{0\\}$, its rank is $0$.\n    $$b_{1}(S^{3}/I^{*}) = \\mathrm{rank}(\\{0\\}) = 0$$\n\nThe first Betti number of the Poincaré homology sphere is $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "2997841"}]}
