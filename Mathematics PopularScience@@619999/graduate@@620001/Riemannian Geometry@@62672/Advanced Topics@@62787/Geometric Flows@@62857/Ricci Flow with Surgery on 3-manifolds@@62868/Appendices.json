It is a well-posed and standard problem in Riemannian geometry.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. We proceed to solve it.\n\n### Solution\nThe evolution of the metric $g(t)$ is governed by the Ricci flow equation:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} g(t) = -2 \\,\\mathrm{Ric}(g(t))\n$$\nThe metric in the neck region is given by the ansatz:\n$$\ng(t) = dz^{2} + r(t)^{2}\\, g_{S^{2}}\n$$\nwhere $g_{S^2}$ is a time-independent metric on the 2-sphere. The only time dependence in the metric arises from the scalar function $r(t)$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the left-hand side of the Ricci flow equation, which is the time derivative of the metric tensor $g(t)$.\n$$\n\\partial_{t} g(t) = \\partial_{t} \\left( dz^{2} + r(t)^{2}\\, g_{S^{2}} \\right)\n$$\nSince $dz^2$ and $g_{S^2}$ are independent of time, the derivative acts only on the coefficient $r(t)^2$:\n$$\n\\partial_{t} g(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}(r(t)^{2}) \\,g_{S^{2}} = 2 r(t) \\frac{dr}{dt} \\,g_{S^{2}}\n$$\nThis is a tensor that is zero on vector fields in the $z$-direction and equals $2 r(t) \\dot{r}(t) g_{S^2}$ on vector fields tangent to the $S^2$ factor. Here, $\\dot{r}(t) = \\frac{dr}{dt}$.\n\nNext, we determine the right-hand side of the Ricci flow equation, which involves the Ricci tensor $\\mathrm{Ric}(g(t))$ of the metric $g(t)$. The problem states to use the Ricci tensor for the product metric $dz^2 + r(t)^2 g_{S^2}$. For a product of Riemannian manifolds $(M_1,g_1)$ and $(M_2,g_2)$, the Ricci tensor of the product metric $g_1 \\oplus g_2$ is the direct sum of the individual Ricci tensors, $\\mathrm{Ric}(g_1) \\oplus \\mathrm{Ric}(g_2)$.\n\nIn our case, $(M_1, g_1)$ is the interval $I$ with the flat metric $dz^2$. Any 1-dimensional manifold is Ricci-flat, so $\\mathrm{Ric}(dz^2) = 0$. This corresponds to the $z$-direction component of the Ricci tensor.\n\nThe second part, $(M_2, g_2)$, is the 2-sphere of radius $r(t)$, with metric $g_{S^2_{r(t)}} = r(t)^2 g_{S^2}$. The problem provides the formula for its Ricci tensor: \"the Ricci tensor of $(S^{2}, r^{2} g_{S^{2}})$ equals $\\frac{1}{r^{2}}$ times the metric restricted to the $S^{2}$ directions\". The metric restricted to the $S^2$ directions is $r(t)^2 g_{S^2}$. Thus, the Ricci tensor on the sphere is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ric}(r(t)^2 g_{S^2}) = \\frac{1}{r(t)^2} \\left( r(t)^2 g_{S^2} \\right) = g_{S^2}\n$$\nCombining the components, the Ricci tensor of the full product metric $g(t)$ has a block structure: it is zero in the $z$-direction and equals $g_{S^2}$ in the directions tangent to the sphere.\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $\\partial_t g(t)$ and $\\mathrm{Ric}(g(t))$ back into the Ricci flow equation.\n$$\n\\partial_{t} g(t) = -2 \\,\\mathrm{Ric}(g(t))\n$$\nConsidering the components of the equation in the $z$-direction, we have $0 = -2(0)$, which is consistent but provides no information.\nConsidering the components in the directions tangent to the $S^2$ factors, we have:\n$$\n2 r(t) \\dot{r}(t) g_{S^2} = -2 g_{S^2}\n$$\nSince $g_{S^2}$ is a non-degenerate metric tensor, we can equate the scalar coefficients on both sides of the equation. This yields the ordinary differential equation for the radius $r(t)$:\n$$\n2 r(t) \\dot{r}(t) = -2\n$$\n$$\nr(t) \\frac{dr}{dt} = -1\n$$\nThis can also be written as $\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{d}{dt}(r(t)^2) = -1$.\nWe solve this ODE by separation of variables or direct integration:\n$$\n\\int r \\,dr = \\int -1 \\,dt\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} r(t)^2 = -t + C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of integration. Thus,\n$$\nr(t)^2 = 2C - 2t\n$$\nThe problem states that $t=T$ is a singular time. In this neck-pinch model, the singularity occurs when the radius of the cylinder shrinks to zero, i.e., $\\lim_{t \\to T} r(t) = 0$. Applying this condition:\n$$\nr(T)^2 = 0 = 2C - 2T\n$$\nThis allows us to determine the integration constant: $2C = 2T$.\nSubstituting this back into the solution for $r(t)^2$:\n$$\nr(t)^2 = 2T - 2t = 2(T-t)\n$$\nSince the radius $r(t)$ must be positive, we take the positive square root:\n$$\nr(t) = \\sqrt{2(T-t)} = \\sqrt{2} \\,(T-t)^{1/2}\n$$\nThe problem specifies the asymptotic behavior of $r(t)$ near the singular time $T$ as:\n$$\nr(t) \\sim A \\,(T - t)^{p}\n$$\nBy comparing our derived solution with this asymptotic form, we can identify the constant $A = \\sqrt{2}$ and the exponent $p$.\n$$\n\\sqrt{2} \\,(T-t)^{1/2} = A \\,(T-t)^p\n$$\nThe exponent is therefore $p = 1/2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "2988720"}, {"introduction": "While an ideal neck is easy to visualize, identifying such structures within a complex, evolving 3-manifold requires a rigorous, quantitative procedure.

Each result must be a boolean indicating whether the corresponding test case satisfies the quantitative neck criterion.", "solution": "The problem statement has been rigorously validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. The problem resides squarely within the domain of Riemannian geometry, specifically concerning the analysis of Ricci flow on $3$-manifolds. It asks for the implementation of a quantitative neck detection algorithm, a concept of central importance in the theory of Ricci flow with surgery, as developed by Hamilton and canonized in Perelman's proof of the Poincaré and Geometrization conjectures. The provided data and criteria are sufficient and consistent for a unique solution to be determined, though a minor ambiguity regarding the presentation of test case data will be addressed by adhering strictly to the formal mathematical definitions.\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine if a region of a $3$-manifold, sampled at a finite number of points, geometrically resembles a cylinder of the form $S^2 \\times \\mathbb{R}$. The Ricci flow equation, $\\partial_t g(t) = -2 \\operatorname{Ric}(g(t))$, evolves the metric $g(t)$ in a way that tends to even out curvature. Regions of high positive curvature shrink, and in three dimensions, can form \"neck\" singularities where the manifold locally looks like a shrinking cylinder. To continue the flow past these singularities, one performs surgery, which involves identifying and excising these neck regions. The implemented criterion is a formalization of this identification process.\n\nA key principle is scale-invariance. The geometry of a neck is independent of its absolute size (the radius of the $S^2$ factor). The Ricci tensor $\\operatorname{Ric}$ and scalar curvature $R$ both scale inversely with the metric scaling factor, so their ratio is scale-invariant. The criterion is therefore formulated in terms of the normalized eigenvalues of the Ricci tensor, $\\mu_k = \\lambda_k/R$, where $\\lambda_k$ are the eigenvalues of $\\operatorname{Ric}$ and $R=\\sum \\lambda_k$. For an ideal cylinder $S^2(r) \\times \\mathbb{R}$, the Ricci eigenvalues are $(1/r^2, 1/r^2, 0)$, and the scalar curvature is $R=2/r^2$. The normalized spectrum is thus exactly $(0, 1/2, 1/2)$, independent of the radius $r$. The provided algorithm checks if the sampled region is \"close\" to this ideal cylindrical spectrum in a quantified sense.\n\nThe procedural implementation will follow the three sets of conditions provided.\n\nFirst, it is essential to process the input data correctly. The problem provides, for each sample point $i$, a set of three normalized eigenvalues. The definitions in the criterion rely on the ordered eigenvalues $\\lambda_{i,1}\\le \\lambda_{i,2}\\le \\lambda_{i,3}$ and the corresponding ordered normalized eigenvalues $\\mu_{i,1}\\le \\mu_{i,2}\\le \\mu_{i,3}$ (assuming positive scalar curvature $R_i>0$, which is true for all test data). The provided data for the normalized eigenvalues is not always pre-sorted. Therefore, for each sample point $i$, the first step must be to sort the given triplet of values to obtain the ordered set $(\\mu_{i,1}, \\mu_{i,2}, \\mu_{i,3})$.\n\nThe algorithmic validation then proceeds as follows, using the given thresholds $\\varepsilon = 0.05$, $\\delta = 0.06$, $\\nu = 0.03$, and $\\theta = 0.08$:\n\n1.  **Local Cylindrical Spectrum Validation:** This set of conditions must hold for every sample point $i$ from $1$ to $m=5$.\n    - Nonnegativity and small axial curvature: The smallest eigenvalue corresponds to the 'axial' direction of the cylinder, which is flat. This is tested by the condition $0\\le \\mu_{i,1}\\le \\varepsilon$.\n    - Near-spherical spectrum: The other two eigenvalues correspond to the $S^2$ factor, which has positive curvature. For an ideal cylinder, both are $\\frac{1}{2}$. This is tested by checking if both $\\mu_{i,2}$ and $\\mu_{i,3}$ are close to $\\frac{1}{2}$: $\\lvert \\mu_{i,2}-\\tfrac{1}{2}\\rvert\\le \\varepsilon$ and $\\lvert \\mu_{i,3}-\\tfrac{1}{2}\\rvert\\le \\varepsilon$.\n    - Low anisotropy: The two spherical directions should have nearly identical curvature. This is checked with the condition $\\lvert \\mu_{i,3}-\\mu_{i,2}\\rvert\\le \\delta$.\n    If any of these inequalities is violated for any sample point $i$, the entire test case is classified as not being a quantitative neck.\n\n2.  **Axial Uniformity Validation:** A neck is not just a single point with a cylindrical spectrum, but a region extended along an axis. This criterion ensures the spectral properties are uniform along the candidate axis.\n    - For each eigenvalue index $k\\in\\{1,2,3\\}$, the total variation of $\\mu_{i,k}$ across all samples $i=1, \\dots, m$ is computed as $\\max_i \\mu_{i,k}-\\min_i \\mu_{i,k}$.\n    - This variation must be bounded by the threshold $\\nu$. That is, for each $k$, we must have $\\max_i \\mu_{i,k}-\\min_i \\mu_{i,k}\\le \\nu$.\n\n3.  **Controlled Scalar Curvature Variation:** The scalar curvature $R$ is related to the inverse square of the neck's radius. This condition ensures the neck's thickness does not vary excessively along the axis.\n    - The relative variation of the scalar curvature is calculated as $\\dfrac{\\max_i R_i-\\min_i R_i}{\\bar{R}}$, where $\\bar{R} = \\frac{1}{m}\\sum_i R_i$ is the average scalar curvature over the samples.\n    - This relative variation must be bounded by the threshold $\\theta$: $\\dfrac{\\max_i R_i-\\min_i R_i}{\\bar{R}}\\le \\theta$.\n\nA test case is declared a quantitative neck if and only if all three of these multipart conditions are fully satisfied. The program will systematically check each condition for each test case and return a boolean result.

This practice delves into the precise construction of the \"caps\" used to seal the manifold after a neck has been excised [@problem_id:1017510]. By enforcing conditions of metric matching and requiring the surgical seam to be a minimal surface, you will determine the necessary radius of the standard 3-sphere from which these caps are harvested, revealing the deep geometric principles that ensure the post-surgery manifold is well-behaved.", "problem": "In the Ricci flow on a 3-manifold, surgery is a crucial procedure to handle neck-pinch singularities. This problem concerns the geometric specifications of such a surgery.\n\nA surgery procedure is controlled by a small length-scale parameter $\\delta  0$. The process is initiated when the maximum scalar curvature on the manifold, $R_{max}$, reaches the threshold value $1/\\delta^2$. The surgery takes place on a *canonical neck*, a region geometrically modeled as a cylinder $S^2 \\times \\mathbb{R}$ with the Riemannian metric $ds^2 = dz^2 + r^2 g_{S^2}$, where $z$ is the coordinate along the cylinder axis, $r$ is the radius of the $S^2$ cross-sections, and $g_{S^2}$ is the standard metric on a unit 2-sphere. The scalar curvature of such a cylinder is given by $R_{cyl} = 2/r^2$.\n\nThe specific neck targeted for surgery is one where its scalar curvature is a fixed fraction $\\alpha$ of the threshold curvature, i.e., $R_{cyl} = \\alpha R_{max}$, for a given constant $0  \\alpha \\le 1$.\n\nThe surgery involves excising the neck and gluing in two *caps* to seal the resulting boundaries. Each cap is a geodesic ball taken from a standard 3-sphere, $S^3$, of radius $R$. The metric of an $S^3$ of radius $R$, in geodesic normal coordinates $(\\rho, \\Omega)$ from a pole, is given by\n$$ds^2_{S^3} = d\\rho^2 + R^2 \\sin^2(\\frac{\\rho}{R}) g_{S^2}$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the geodesic distance from the pole. A cap is a region defined by $0 \\le \\rho \\le \\rho_0$ for some $\\rho_0$.\n\nTo ensure a geometrically sound attachment, two conditions must be met at the boundary where the cap is glued to the remaining part of the manifold:\n1.  The metric on the boundary of the cap must match the metric of the neck's cross-section.\n2.  The boundary of the cap must be a minimal surface when viewed as a submanifold of the cap's geometry. This ensures the smoothest possible join.\n\nDetermine the radius $R$ of the standard 3-sphere used for the surgery.
