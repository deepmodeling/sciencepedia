It is a well-defined question in differential geometry that is scientifically sound, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution.\n\n### Derivation of Scalar Curvature\n\nWe begin with the general formula for the scalar curvature $\\operatorname{Scal}_{g}$ of a warped product manifold $M = B \\times_f F$ with metric $g = g_B + f^2 g_F$. Let $\\dim(B) = m$ and $\\dim(F) = k$. The formula is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Scal}_{g} = \\operatorname{Scal}_{g_B} + \\frac{1}{f^2}\\operatorname{Scal}_{g_F} - \\frac{2k}{f} \\Delta_B f - \\frac{k(k-1)}{f^2} |\\nabla_B f|_{g_B}^2\n$$\nwhere $\\operatorname{Scal}_{g_B}$ and $\\operatorname{Scal}_{g_F}$ are the scalar curvatures of the base manifold $(B, g_B)$ and fiber manifold $(F, g_F)$ respectively. $\\Delta_B$ and $\\nabla_B$ are the Laplace-Beltrami operator and the gradient on the base manifold $(B, g_B)$.\n\nIn the given problem, we have:\n- **Base Manifold**: $(B, g_B) = (I, dt^2)$. This is a $1$-dimensional interval with the standard Euclidean metric. Thus, $m=1$.\n- **Fiber Manifold**: $(F, g_F) = (S^{n-1}, g_{S^{n-1}})$. The dimension is $k = n-1$.\n\nWe now compute each term in the general formula for our specific case.\n\n1.  **Curvature of the Base**: The base manifold $(I, dt^2)$ is a one-dimensional real interval, which is intrinsically flat. Therefore, its scalar curvature is zero:\n    $$\n    \\operatorname{Scal}_{g_B} = 0\n    $$\n\n2.  **Curvature of the Fiber**: The fiber is the $(n-1)$-dimensional unit sphere $S^{n-1}$ with its standard round metric of constant sectional curvature $K = +1$. The scalar curvature of a $k$-dimensional manifold of constant sectional curvature $K$ is given by $k(k-1)K$. For the fiber, $k=n-1$, so:\n    $$\n    \\operatorname{Scal}_{g_F} = (n-1)((n-1)-1)(+1) = (n-1)(n-2)\n    $$\n\n3.  **Gradient of the Warping Function**: The warping function $f(t)$ depends only on the coordinate $t$ of the base manifold $I$. The gradient $\\nabla_B f$ on $(I, dt^2)$ is given by:\n    $$\n    \\nabla_B f = \\frac{df}{dt} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = f'(t) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\n    $$\n    The squared norm of this gradient with respect to the metric $g_B = dt^2$ is:\n    $$\n    |\\nabla_B f|_{g_B}^2 = g_B\\left(f'(t) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}, f'(t) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\right) = (f'(t))^2\n    $$\n\n4.  **Laplacian of the Warping Function**: The Laplace-Beltrami operator on $(I, dt^2)$ acting on a function $f(t)$ is simply the second derivative with respect to $t$. In coordinates, $\\Delta_B f = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})}} \\partial_i (\\sqrt{\\det(g_{ij})} g^{ij} \\partial_j f)$. Here, $g_{tt}=1$, $g^{tt}=1$, and $\\det(g_{ij})=1$, so:\n    $$\n    \\Delta_B f = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(1 \\cdot \\frac{df}{dt}\\right) = \\frac{d^2f}{dt^2} = f''(t)\n    $$\n\nNow, we substitute these components back into the general formula for $\\operatorname{Scal}_{g}$. We have $k = n-1$.\n$$\n\\operatorname{Scal}_{g}(t) = 0 + \\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{f(t)^2} - \\frac{2(n-1)}{f(t)} f''(t) - \\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{f(t)^2} (f'(t))^2\n$$\nCombining the terms with $f(t)^2$ in the denominator, we arrive at the final expression for the scalar curvature:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Scal}_{g}(t) = \\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{f(t)^2} \\left[1 - (f'(t))^2\\right] - \\frac{2(n-1)}{f(t)} f''(t)\n$$\nThis can be written in a more compact form:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Scal}_{g}(t) = \\frac{(n-1)(n-2)(1 - (f'(t))^2)}{f(t)^2} - \\frac{2(n-1)f''(t)}{f(t)}\n$$\n\n### Condition for Positive Scalar Curvature (PSC)\n\nThe problem asks for the pointwise conditions on $f$ that ensure PSC, i.e., $\\operatorname{Scal}_{g}(t) > 0$.\n$$\n\\frac{(n-1)(n-2)(1 - (f'(t))^2)}{f(t)^2} - \\frac{2(n-1)f''(t)}{f(t)} > 0\n$$\nSince $n \\ge 3$, the term $n-1$ is positive. We can divide the inequality by $n-1$ without changing its direction:\n$$\n\\frac{(n-2)(1 - (f'(t))^2)}{f(t)^2} - \\frac{2f''(t)}{f(t)} > 0\n$$\nGiven that $f(t) > 0$, we can multiply by $f(t)^2$ to clear the denominators:\n$$\n(n-2)(1 - (f'(t))^2) - 2f(t)f''(t) > 0\n$$\nThis inequality is the pointwise condition on the warping function $f(t)$ for the manifold to have positive scalar curvature. For instance, a sufficient (but not necessary) set of conditions could be that $f$ is concave ($f''(t) \\le 0$) and its slope is controlled, $|f'(t)| < 1$. Another important case is $f''(t) = -\\frac{n-2}{2f(t)}(1-(f')^2)$, which yields zero scalar curvature. Any function $f$ satisfying the strict inequality above will generate a metric with PSC. A classic example is the round sphere $S^n$ itself, which can be described by a metric of this form with $f(t)=\\cos(t)$ on $I=(-\\pi/2, \\pi/2)$, for which the inequality becomes $n(\\cos(t))^2 > 0$, which holds on the open interval.\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be the closed-form expression for $\\operatorname{Scal}_{g}(t)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{(n-1)(n-2)(1 - (f'(t))^2)}{f(t)^2} - \\frac{2(n-1)f''(t)}{f(t)}}\n$$", "id": "3032064"}, {"introduction": "Building on the foundational curvature formula, this practice challenges you to apply it in a constructive setting.

The dimension of the fiber is $m=n-1$. The scalar curvature $R_F$ of a space of constant sectional curvature $K$ is $m(m-1)K$.

For $r \\in (0,L)$, the function $f(r)>0$ and $n \\geq 3$, so the prefactor $\\frac{n-1}{f(r)^2}$ is strictly positive. The sign of $R_g(r)$ is determined by the sign of the expression in the brackets:\n$$S(r) = (n-2)(1 - (f'(r))^2) - 2f(r)f''(r)$$\nThe properties of a torpedo profile are:\n(i) $f(r) \\equiv \\rho > 0$ on a closed interval $I=[a, a+\\ell] \\subset (0,L)$.\n(ii) $f''(r) \\leq 0$ for all $r \\in (0,L/2]$.\n(iii) $f'(r)$ is nonincreasing on $[0,L/2]$, which implies $0 \\leq f'(r) \\leq 1$ on this interval, given $f'(0)=1$ and the existence of a cylindrical part where $f'(r)=0$.\n\nLet's analyze $S(r)$ on different parts of the interval $(0,L)$. By the symmetry condition $f(L-r)=f(r)$, it suffices to analyze $r \\in (0, L/2]$.\n-   For $r \\in (0, L/2]$, property (iii) states $0 \\leq f'(r) \\leq 1$, so $(f'(r))^2 \\leq 1$. This implies $1 - (f'(r))^2 \\geq 0$. As $n \\geq 3$, the term $(n-2)(1 - (f'(r))^2)$ is non-negative.\n-   For $r \\in (0, L/2]$, property (ii) states $f''(r) \\leq 0$. Since $f(r)>0$, the term $-2f(r)f''(r)$ is also non-negative.\n-   Thus, $S(r)$ is the sum of two non-negative terms for $r \\in (0, L/2]$, which means $R_g(r) \\geq 0$.\n\nTo show strict positivity, we must demonstrate that both terms do not vanish simultaneously.\n-   Consider the region $(0,a)$, which is the part of the profile before the cylindrical band. For the smooth function $f$ to connect the pole (where $f'(0)=1$) to the cylinder (where $f'(r)=0$ for $r \\geq a$), its derivative $f'(r)$ must be strictly between $0$ and $1$ for $r \\in (0,a)$. Therefore, $1 - (f'(r))^2 > 0$ on $(0,a)$. The first term of $S(r)$, $(n-2)(1 - (f'(r))^2)$, is strictly positive on $(0,a)$. Since the second term $-2f(r)f''(r)$ is non-negative, their sum $S(r)$ is strictly positive.\n-   Consider the interior of the cylindrical band, $r \\in (a, a+\\ell)$. Here, $f(r)=\\rho$, so $f'(r)=0$ and $f''(r)=0$.\n    $$S(r) = (n-2)(1-0^2) - 2\\rho(0) = n-2$$\n    Since $n \\geq 3$, $S(r)=n-2 \\geq 1 > 0$. Thus, $R_g(r)$ is strictly positive on the cylindrical band.\n-   At the connection points, like $r=a$, smoothness of $f$ ensures $f'(a)=0$ and $f''(a)=0$. So $R_g(a)$ is also positive for the same reason.\n\nBy symmetry, the scalar curvature is also strictly positive on $(L/2,L)$. Therefore, for any torpedo profile, the metric $g$ has strictly positive scalar curvature for all $r \\in (0,L)$.\n\nSecond, we explain why the metric does not have constant sectional curvature. A warped product metric of the form $dr^2 + f(r)^2 g_{S^{n-1}}$ has constant sectional curvature $K$ if and only if the warping function $f(r)$ has one of the following forms:\n-   $f(r) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{K}}\\sin(\\sqrt{K}r)$ for $K>0$.\n-   $f(r) = r$ for $K=0$.\n-   $f(r) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{-K}}\\sinh(\\sqrt{-K}r)$ for $K<0$.\nEach of these functions is analytic. An analytic function that is constant on any open interval must be constant everywhere. The torpedo profile specifies that $f(r) \\equiv \\rho$ on the interval $I=[a, a+\\ell]$, but $f(r)$ is not constant everywhere (e.g., $f(0)=0 \\neq \\rho$). Therefore, the warping function $f(r)$ for a torpedo profile cannot be one of the functions required for constant sectional curvature. Consequently, the resulting metric $g$ does not have constant sectional curvature.\n\n(3) Computation of the scalar curvature on the cylindrical band.\n\nOn the equatorial cylindrical band $I=[a, a+\\ell]$, the warping function is constant: $f(r) \\equiv \\rho$.\nThis implies that its first and second derivatives are zero for any $r$ in the interior of $I$:\n$$f'(r) = 0$$\n$$f''(r) = 0$$\nDue to the smoothness requirement on $f$, these conditions also hold at the endpoints of the interval $I$.\nWe substitute these values into the scalar curvature formula derived in part (1):\n$$R_g(r) = \\frac{n-1}{f(r)^2} \\left[ (n-2)(1 - (f'(r))^2) - 2f(r)f''(r) \\right]$$\n$$R_g(r) = \\frac{n-1}{\\rho^2} \\left[ (n-2)(1 - 0^2) - 2\\rho(0) \\right]$$\n$$R_g(r) = \\frac{n-1}{\\rho^2} \\left[ (n-2)(1) - 0 \\right]$$\n$$R_g(r) = \\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{\\rho^2}$$\nThis is the constant value of the scalar curvature on the entire cylindrical band $I$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{\\rho^2}}$$", "id": "3032119"}, {"introduction": "This practice shifts our focus from metric construction to the analytical side of positive scalar curvature geometry.

We apply the operator $L_{g_{\\mathrm{round}}}$ to the eigenfunction $f_{\\ell}$:\n$$L_{g_{\\mathrm{round}}} f_{\\ell} = \\left(-\\frac{4(n-1)}{n-2}\\,\\Delta_{g_{\\mathrm{round}}} + R_{g_{\\mathrm{round}}}\\right) f_{\\ell}$$\nUsing the linearity of the operator and the fact that $R_{g_{\\mathrm{round}}}$ is a constant, we can write:\n$$L_{g_{\\mathrm{round}}} f_{\\ell} = -\\frac{4(n-1)}{n-2}(\\Delta_{g_{\\mathrm{round}}} f_{\\ell}) + R_{g_{\\mathrm{round}}}f_{\\ell}$$\nNow, we substitute the eigenvalue of $\\Delta_{g_{\\mathrm{round}}}$ and the value of $R_{g_{\\mathrm{round}}}$:\n$$L_{g_{\\mathrm{round}}} f_{\\ell} = -\\frac{4(n-1)}{n-2} \\left[ -\\ell(\\ell+n-1) f_{\\ell} \\right] + n(n-1) f_{\\ell}$$\nFactoring out the eigenfunction $f_{\\ell}$ from the right-hand side gives:\n$$L_{g_{\\mathrm{round}}} f_{\\ell} = \\left[ \\frac{4(n-1)}{n-2} \\ell(\\ell+n-1) + n(n-1) \\right] f_{\\ell}$$\nFrom this, we identify the eigenvalue $\\mu_{\\ell}$ corresponding to the degree-$\\ell$ spherical harmonics:\n$$\\mu_{\\ell} = \\frac{4(n-1)}{n-2} \\ell(\\ell+n-1) + n(n-1)$$\nTo simplify this expression, we can factor out the common term $(n-1)$:\n$$\\mu_{\\ell} = (n-1) \\left[ \\frac{4\\ell(\\ell+n-1)}{n-2} + n \\right]$$\nCombining the terms inside the brackets over a common denominator:\n$$\\mu_{\\ell} = (n-1) \\left[ \\frac{4\\ell^2 + 4(n-1)\\ell + n(n-2)}{n-2} \\right] = \\frac{n-1}{n-2} \\left[ 4\\ell^2 + (4n-4)\\ell + n^2-2n \\right]$$\nThe quadratic polynomial in $\\ell$ within the brackets, $P(\\ell) = 4\\ell^2 + (4n-4)\\ell + (n^2-2n)$, can be factored. The roots of $P(\\ell)=0$ are given by the quadratic formula:\n$$\\ell = \\frac{-(4n-4) \\pm \\sqrt{(4n-4)^2 - 4(4)(n^2-2n)}}{2(4)} = \\frac{-4(n-1) \\pm \\sqrt{16(n-1)^2 - 16(n^2-2n)}}{8}$$\n$$\\ell = \\frac{-4(n-1) \\pm 4\\sqrt{(n^2-2n+1) - (n^2-2n)}}{8} = \\frac{-4(n-1) \\pm 4\\sqrt{1}}{8} = \\frac{-(n-1) \\pm 1}{2}$$\nThe two roots are $\\ell_1 = \\frac{-n+1+1}{2} = \\frac{2-n}{2}$ and $\\ell_2 = \\frac{-n+1-1}{2} = -\\frac{n}{2}$.\nThus, the polynomial factors as $P(\\ell) = 4(\\ell-\\ell_1)(\\ell-\\ell_2) = 4(\\ell - \\frac{2-n}{2})(\\ell - (-\\frac{n}{2})) = 4(\\ell + \\frac{n-2}{2})(\\ell + \\frac{n}{2}) = (2\\ell + n-2)(2\\ell+n)$.\nSubstituting this factorization back into the expression for $\\mu_{\\ell}$:\n$$\\mu_{\\ell} = \\frac{n-1}{n-2} (2\\ell+n-2)(2\\ell+n)$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the eigenvalue $\\mu_{\\ell}$ of $L_{g_{\\mathrm{round}}}$ acting on degree-$\\ell$ spherical harmonics.\n\nAs a final verification step, we check the eigenvalue for constant functions, which correspond to spherical harmonics of degree $\\ell=0$. Setting $\\ell=0$ in our derived formula:\n$$\\mu_{0} = \\frac{n-1}{n-2} (2(0)+n-2)(2(0)+n) = \\frac{n-1}{n-2} (n-2)(n) = n(n-1)$$\nThis confirms the problem statement's claim that constant functions are eigenfunctions with eigenvalue $n(n-1)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{(n-1)(2\\ell+n-2)(2\\ell+n)}{n-2}}\n$$", "id": "3032083"}]}
