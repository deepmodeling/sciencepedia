The given information consists of the distances $a = d(p,u)$ and $b = d(p,v)$ from a fixed point $p$, and the angle $\\theta = \\angle upv$ between the minimizing geodesics from $p$ to $u$ and from $p$ to $v$.\n\nThe fundamental tool for this problem is the hinge comparison principle, also known as Toponogov's theorem in the smooth Riemannian manifold setting, which extends to Alexandrov spaces. This principle relates a geodesic triangle in the space $X$ to a comparison triangle in a model space of constant curvature $\\kappa$.\n\nLet $\\triangle puv$ be the geodesic triangle in $X$. The hinge comparison principle states that if we construct a comparison triangle $\\triangle \\tilde{p}\\tilde{u}\\tilde{v}$ in the $2$-dimensional model space of constant curvature $\\kappa$, denoted $M^2_\\kappa$, such that the side lengths adjacent to the vertex $\\tilde{p}$ are equal to those in $X$, i.e., $d_{M^2_\\kappa}(\\tilde{p}, \\tilde{u}) = a$ and $d_{M^2_\\kappa}(\\tilde{p}, \\tilde{v}) = b$, and the angle at $\\tilde{p}$ is also equal, $\\angle_{\\tilde{p}} = \\theta$, then the length of the third side in $X$ is bounded below by the length of the third side of the comparison triangle in $M^2_\\kappa$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\nd(u,v) \\ge d_{M^2_\\kappa}(\\tilde{u}, \\tilde{v})\n$$\nThe problem thus reduces to calculating the length of the side $\\tilde{u}\\tilde{v}$ in the model space $M^2_\\kappa$. Let this length be $s_{\\kappa}(a,b,\\theta) = d_{M^2_\\kappa}(\\tilde{u}, \\tilde{v})$. We can compute this length using the Law of Cosines appropriate for the geometry of $M^2_\\kappa$. The geometry of $M^2_\\kappa$ depends on the sign of $\\kappa$.\n\nWe analyze the three cases for the value of $\\kappa$:\n\nCase 1: $\\kappa  0$ (Spherical Geometry)\nThe model space $M^2_\\kappa$ is a sphere $S^2_R$ with radius $R = 1/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$.

The lengths of the sides adjacent to $\\tilde{p}$ are $a$ and $b$. The angle between them is $\\theta$. The length of the third side, $s_{\\kappa}(a,b,\\theta)$, is given by the Spherical Law of Cosines:\n$$\n\\cos\\left(\\frac{s_{\\kappa}}{R}\\right) = \\cos\\left(\\frac{a}{R}\\right) \\cos\\left(\\frac{b}{R}\\right) + \\sin\\left(\\frac{a}{R}\\right) \\sin\\left(\\frac{b}{R}\\right) \\cos(\\theta)\n$$\nSubstituting $R = 1/\\sqrt{\\kappa}$, we have:\n$$\n\\cos\\left(s_{\\kappa}\\sqrt{\\kappa}\\right) = \\cos(a\\sqrt{\\kappa}) \\cos(b\\sqrt{\\kappa}) + \\sin(a\\sqrt{\\kappa}) \\sin(b\\sqrt{\\kappa}) \\cos(\\theta)\n$$\nSolving for $s_{\\kappa}(a,b,\\theta)$, we take the inverse cosine.

It is self-contained, scientifically correct, and well-posed. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution is structured in two parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: Identification of the Space of Directions $\\Sigma_{p}$ and the Tangent Cone $T_{p}X$**\n\nThe space $X$ is a two-dimensional Euclidean cone constructed from a planar sector of angle $\\theta$. We can represent points on this cone using coordinates $(r, \\phi)$ from the unrolled sector in the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Here, $r \\in [0, \\infty)$ is the radial distance from the vertex, and $\\phi \\in [0, \\theta]$ is the angle. The apex $p$ of the cone corresponds to the point $r=0$. The cone structure is formed by identifying the points $(r, 0)$ with $(r, \\theta)$ for all $r \\ge 0$. The metric on $X$ is inherited from the Euclidean metric of the sector, given by the line element $ds^2 = dr^2 + r^2 d\\phi^2$.\n\nThe **space of directions** $\\Sigma_{p}$ at the apex $p$ is, by definition, the set of all directions of geodesics emanating from $p$. In our cone, the geodesics starting at $p$ are the images of the straight rays starting from the vertex of the sector. Each such ray is uniquely determined by its angle $\\phi \\in [0, \\theta]$. The identification of the boundary rays means that the direction at angle $\\phi=0$ is the same as the direction at angle $\\phi=\\theta$. Therefore, the set of directions $\\Sigma_{p}$ is topologically a circle. The metric on $\\Sigma_{p}$ is given by the angle between the corresponding geodesics. The angle between two geodesics at angles $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$ in the sector is simply $|\\phi_1 - \\phi_2|$. The total angular measure of the space of directions is $\\theta$. Thus, $\\Sigma_{p}$ is metrically a circle of circumference $\\theta$.\n\nThe **tangent cone** $T_{p}X$ at a point $p$ of a metric space is defined as the Gromov-Hausdorff limit of the rescaled spaces. For a metric cone like $X$, the tangent cone at its apex $p$ is isometric to the cone itself. This can be shown by considering the effect of scaling the metric $d$ by a factor $\\lambda  0$. The new line element is $ds' = \\lambda ds$, so $(ds')^2 = \\lambda^2 ds^2 = \\lambda^2 (dr^2 + r^2 d\\phi^2) = (d(\\lambda r))^2 + (\\lambda r)^2 d\\phi^2$. Letting $r' = \\lambda r$, we recover the original metric form $(ds')^2 = (dr')^2 + (r')^2 d\\phi^2$. This shows that the rescaled space $(X, \\lambda d)$ is isometric to the original space $(X, d)$ via the map $(r, \\phi) \\mapsto (\\lambda r, \\phi)$. Consequently, the Gromov-Hausdorff limit as $\\lambda \\to \\infty$ is simply the space $X$ itself.\nTherefore, the tangent cone $T_{p}X$ is isometric to the original cone $X$. In summary, $T_{p}X$ is the two-dimensional Euclidean cone formed from a sector of angle $\\theta$.\n\n**Part 2: Computation of $\\mathcal{H}^{2}(B_{T_{p}X}(p,1))$**\n\nWe are asked to compute the two-dimensional Hausdorff measure $\\mathcal{H}^{2}$ of the unit ball in the tangent cone $T_{p}X$ centered at its apex $p$. This unit ball is the set $B_{T_{p}X}(p,1) = \\{q \\in T_{p}X \\mid d_{T_p X}(p, q) \\leq 1\\}$.\n\nFrom Part 1, we established that $T_{p}X$ is isometric to the original cone $X$. Thus, we need to compute the measure of the unit ball $B_{X}(p,1)$ in the cone $X$. In the $(r, \\phi)$ coordinate system for $X$, the distance from the apex $p$ is given by the coordinate $r$. The condition $d_{X}(p, q) \\leq 1$ translates to $r \\leq 1$.\n\nThe set $B_{X}(p,1)$ is therefore the portion of the cone corresponding to $r \\in [0, 1]$. When unrolled, this is a sector of a Euclidean circle of radius $R=1$ and angle $\\theta$.\nThe two-dimensional Hausdorff measure $\\mathcal{H}^{2}$ on the cone is defined to be the area of this unrolled sector. The standard formula for the area $A$ of a sector of a circle with radius $R$ and central angle $\\alpha$ (in radians) is:\n$$A = \\frac{1}{2} \\alpha R^2$$\nIn our case, the radius is $R=1$ and the angle is $\\alpha=\\theta$. Substituting these values, we obtain the measure of the unit ball:\n$$\\mathcal{H}^{2}(B_{T_{p}X}(p,1)) = \\frac{1}{2} \\theta (1)^2 = \\frac{\\theta}{2}$$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression for the two-dimensional Hausdorff measure of the unit ball in the tangent cone at the apex.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\theta}{2}}$$", "id": "2968389"}, {"introduction": "The abstract conditions of curvature being bounded above or below have powerful and often intuitive geometric consequences.

Let $\\triangle(\\bar{p}_1, \\bar{p}_2, \\bar{p}_3)$ be the comparison triangle in $\\mathbb{E}^2$ with identical side lengths. For any two points $q_1 \\in [p_1, p_2]$ and $q_2 \\in [p_1, p_3]$, let $\\bar{q}_1$ and $\\bar{q}_2$ be the corresponding points on $[\\bar{p}_1, \\bar{p}_2]$ and $[\\bar{p}_1, \\bar{p}_3]$ such that $d(p_1, q_1) = d_{\\mathbb{E}^2}(\\bar{p}_1, \\bar{q}_1)$ and $d(p_1, q_2) = d_{\\mathbb{E}^2}(\\bar{p}_1, \\bar{q}_2)$. The CAT$(0)$ condition is then $d(q_1, q_2) \\le d_{\\mathbb{E}^2}(\\bar{q}_1, \\bar{q}_2)$.\n\nIn our problem, the space is $\\mathcal{X}$, and we consider the triangle $\\triangle(x,y,z)$. The points on the sides are the midpoints $m_{xy}$ on $[x,y]$ and $m_{xz}$ on $[x,z]$. By definition, $d(x, m_{xy}) = \\frac{c}{2}$ and $d(x, m_{xz}) = \\frac{b}{2}$. The comparison triangle is $\\triangle(\\bar{x},\\bar{y},\\bar{z})$ in $\\mathbb{E}^{2}$. The corresponding points are the midpoints $\\bar{m}_{xy}$ on $[\\bar{x},\\bar{y}]$ and $\\bar{m}_{xz}$ on $[\\bar{x},\\bar{z}]$, which satisfy $d_{\\mathbb{E}^2}(\\bar{x}, \\bar{m}_{xy}) = \\frac{c}{2}$ and $d_{\\mathbb{E}^2}(\\bar{x}, \\bar{m}_{xz}) = \\frac{b}{2}$. Applying the CAT$(0)$ definition directly, we obtain the first inequality:\n$$d_{\\mathcal{X}}(m_{xy},m_{xz}) \\le d_{\\mathbb{E}^{2}}(\\bar{m}_{xy},\\bar{m}_{xz})$$\n\nConversely, a metric space $(\\mathcal{M}, d)$ is a CBB$(0)$ space if the distance comparison is reversed. For any geodesic triangle and any two points on its sides originating from a common vertex, the distance between them is no less than the distance between the corresponding points in the Euclidean comparison triangle.\nIn our problem, the space is $\\mathcal{Y}$, and we consider the triangle $\\triangle(x',y',z')$. The points are the midpoints $m'_{x'y'}$ on $[x',y']$ and $m'_{x'z'}$ on $[x',z']$. The comparison triangle in $\\mathbb{E}^2$ is again $\\triangle(\\bar{x},\\bar{y},\\bar{z})$, since the side lengths $a,b,c$ are the same. The comparison points are $\\bar{m}_{xy}$ and $\\bar{m}_{xz}$ as before. Applying the CBB$(0)$ definition, we have:\n$$d_{\\mathcal{Y}}(m'_{x'y'},m'_{x'z'}) \\ge d_{\\mathbb{E}^{2}}(\\bar{m}_{xy},\\bar{m}_{xz})$$\nThese two inequalities establish the requested dual comparison.\n\nThe second part of the problem is to compute the distance $d_{\\mathbb{E}^{2}}(\\bar{m}_{xy},\\bar{m}_{xz})$ in the Euclidean plane. We consider the comparison triangle $\\triangle(\\bar{x},\\bar{y},\\bar{z})$ with side lengths $d_{\\mathbb{E}^{2}}(\\bar{y},\\bar{z}) = a$, $d_{\\mathbb{E}^{2}}(\\bar{x},\\bar{z}) = b$, and $d_{\\mathbb{E}^{2}}(\\bar{x},\\bar{y}) = c$. The point $\\bar{m}_{xy}$ is the midpoint of the side $[\\bar{x},\\bar{y}]$, and $\\bar{m}_{xz}$ is the midpoint of the side $[\\bar{x},\\bar{z}]$.\n\nLet's consider the triangle $\\triangle(\\bar{x},\\bar{y},\\bar{z})$. The line segment $[\\bar{m}_{xy}, \\bar{m}_{xz}]$ connects the midpoints of two sides of this triangle, namely $[\\bar{x},\\bar{y}]$ and $[\\bar{x},\\bar{z}]$. According to the Triangle Midsegment Theorem (a fundamental result in Euclidean geometry), the segment connecting the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and is half the length of the third side.\n\nIn our case, the third side is $[\\bar{y},\\bar{z}]$. The length of this side is given as $a$. Therefore, the length of the segment $[\\bar{m}_{xy}, \\bar{m}_{xz}]$ is half the length of $[\\bar{y},\\bar{z}]$.\n$$d_{\\mathbb{E}^{2}}(\\bar{m}_{xy},\\bar{m}_{xz}) = \\frac{1}{2} d_{\\mathbb{E}^{2}}(\\bar{y},\\bar{z}) = \\frac{a}{2}$$\nThis expression depends only on the side length $a$. The side lengths $b$ and $c$ are required for the existence and definition of the triangle, but the specific distance requested is independent of them.\n\nCombining our results, we have established the inequalities:\n$$d_{\\mathcal{X}}(m_{xy},m_{xz}) \\le \\frac{a}{2}$$\n$$d_{\\mathcal{Y}}(m'_{x'y'},m'_{x'z'}) \\ge \\frac{a}{2}$$\nThe expression $\\frac{a}{2}$ is the closed-form analytic expression that serves as the common bound. The problem asks for this single expression.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{a}{2}}$$", "id": "3025149"}]}
