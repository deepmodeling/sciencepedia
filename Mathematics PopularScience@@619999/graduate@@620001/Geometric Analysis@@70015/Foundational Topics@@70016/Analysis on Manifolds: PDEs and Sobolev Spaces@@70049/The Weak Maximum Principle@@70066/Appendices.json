The operator is given by $L u = \\Delta u + c u$, with the constant $c=6$.\n\nFirst, we must validate the problem statement. The problem explicitly refers to the weak maximum principle, which states that for an elliptic operator of the form $L'u = \\sum a_{ij} u_{x_i x_j} + \\sum b_i u_{x_i} + c_0 u$, if $c_0 \\le 0$ and $L'u \\ge 0$ in a bounded domain $\\Omega$, then the maximum of $u$ on the closed domain $\\overline{\\Omega}$ must be achieved on the boundary $\\partial \\Omega$.\n\nIn the given problem, the operator is $L u = \\Delta u + 6u$. This is an elliptic operator where the zeroth-order coefficient is $c_0(x) = 6$. Since $c_0 = 6 > 0$, the condition for the standard weak maximum principle is violated. The problem is therefore a valid exercise in constructing a counterexample to demonstrate the necessity of the condition $c_0 \\le 0$ for the maximum principle to hold. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed as a construction task, and free of contradictions.\n\nWe proceed to construct such a function $u(x)$. The domain $\\Omega$ is a disk centered at the origin, which suggests searching for a radially symmetric solution of the form $u(x) = f(|x|^2)$. Let's propose a simple polynomial form, which is guaranteed to be smooth. Let's try to find a function of the form:\n$$u(x) = A - B|x|^{2}$$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are real constants. For this function to be nonconstant, we must have $B \\neq 0$.\n\nFor $u(x)$ to attain a strict interior maximum, its maximum value must occur at a point $x_0 \\in \\Omega$ and be strictly greater than any value on the boundary $\\partial\\Omega$. The function $u(x) = A - B|x|^2$ has a single extremum at the origin $x=0$. At this point, $\\nabla u = -2Bx = 0$. The Hessian matrix of $u$ has diagonal entries $-2B$ and off-diagonal entries $0$. For $x=0$ to be a maximum, the Hessian must be negative semi-definite, which requires $B \\ge 0$. For a strict maximum, we require $B>0$.\n\nIf $B>0$, the maximum of $u(x)$ occurs at $x=0$ with value $u(0) = A$. On the boundary $\\partial\\Omega$, we have $|x| = r = 1/\\sqrt{3}$, and the value of the function is:\n$u(x)|_{\\partial\\Omega} = A - B r^{2} = A - B \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^{2} = A - \\frac{B}{3}$\nFor the interior maximum at $x=0$ to be strictly greater than all boundary values, we need $u(0) > u(x)|_{\\partial\\Omega}$, which means $A > A - B/3$. This simplifies to $B/3 > 0$, or $B > 0$. This is consistent with our requirement for the extremum at the origin to be a maximum.\n\nNext, we impose the condition $L u \\ge 0$ in $\\Omega$.\nFirst, we compute the Laplacian of $u(x) = A - B(x_1^2 + x_2^2)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x_1} = -2 B x_1 \\implies \\frac{\\partial^{2} u}{\\partial x_1^{2}} = -2B $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x_2} = -2 B x_2 \\implies \\frac{\\partial^{2} u}{\\partial x_2^{2}} = -2B $$\nThus, the Laplacian is:\n$$ \\Delta u = \\frac{\\partial^{2} u}{\\partial x_1^{2}} + \\frac{\\partial^{2} u}{\\partial x_2^{2}} = -2B - 2B = -4B $$\nNow, we compute $Lu$:\n$$ L u = \\Delta u + 6u = -4B + 6(A - B|x|^{2}) = (6A - 4B) - 6B|x|^{2} $$\nWe require $L u \\ge 0$ for all $x \\in \\Omega$, i.e., for all $|x| < 1/\\sqrt{3}$.\nSince we established that $B>0$, the expression for $Lu$ is a decreasing function of $|x|$. Therefore, if the inequality holds at the boundary of the domain, it will hold for all points in the interior. We must check the condition at the point where $Lu$ is minimal, which is on the boundary $|x|=r=1/\\sqrt{3}$.\n$$ (6A - 4B) - 6B r^{2} \\ge 0 $$\n$$ (6A - 4B) - 6B \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\ge 0 $$\n$$ 6A - 4B - 2B \\ge 0 $$\n$$ 6A - 6B \\ge 0 \\implies A \\ge B $$\nSo, to satisfy all conditions, we need to choose constants $A$ and $B$ such that $B > 0$ and $A \\ge B$.\n\nTo provide a specific, explicit function, we can choose the simplest possible values that satisfy these constraints. Let us set $B=1$. The condition $A \\ge B$ becomes $A \\ge 1$. Let us choose $A=1$.\nWith $A=1$ and $B=1$, our candidate function is:\n$$ u(x) = 1 - |x|^{2} $$\nLet us verify this function against all problem requirements:\n1.  **Function properties**: $u(x) = 1 - (x_1^2 + x_2^2)$ is a polynomial, thus it is nonconstant and belongs to $C^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{R}^2)$, which is a stronger condition than $u \\in C^{2}(\\Omega) \\cap C^{0}(\\overline{\\Omega})$.\n2.  **Strict interior maximum**: The function $u(x) = 1 - |x|^2$ has a strict global maximum at $x=0$, with $u(0)=1$. The boundary is $|x|=1/\\sqrt{3}$, where $u(x) = 1 - (1/\\sqrt{3})^2 = 1 - 1/3 = 2/3$. Since $u(0)=1 > 2/3$, the function has a strict interior maximum whose value exceeds all boundary values.\n3.  **Inequality $L u \\ge 0$**: For $u(x) = 1 - |x|^2$, we have $A=1, B=1$. Our previous calculation yields $Lu = (6(1) - 4(1)) - 6(1)|x|^2 = 2 - 6|x|^2$. In the domain $\\Omega$, we have $|x| < 1/\\sqrt{3}$, which implies $|x|^2 < 1/3$. Therefore, $6|x|^2 < 2$, and $L u = 2 - 6|x|^2 > 0$ for all $x \\in \\Omega$. The condition $Lu \\ge 0$ is strictly satisfied in the interior of the domain.\n\nThe function $u(x) = 1 - |x|^2$ satisfies all the required properties.

The method prescribed is to construct a suitable harmonic function $b(x)$ that matches given values on the boundary spheres and then apply the weak maximum principle.\n\nFirst, we construct the comparison function $b(x)$. The problem suggests a radial function of the form $b(x) = b(r) = \\alpha + \\beta r^{2-n}$, where $r = |x|$ and $\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\mathbb{R}$ are constants. We must verify that this function is harmonic, i.e., $\\Delta b = 0$, on the annulus $A_{r_{1},r_{2}}$.

Since $0 < r_{1}$, the annulus $A_{r_{1},r_{2}}$ does not contain the origin, so $b$ is harmonic on $A_{r_{1},r_{2}}$.\n\nNext, we determine the constants $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ such that $b(x)$ satisfies the specific boundary conditions $b(r_{1}) = m$ and $b(r_{2}) = M$. These conditions yield a system of two linear equations for $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$:\n1. $b(r_{1}) = \\alpha + \\beta r_{1}^{2-n} = m$\n2. $b(r_{2}) = \\alpha + \\beta r_{2}^{2-n} = M$\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second gives:\n$$ \\beta (r_{2}^{2-n} - r_{1}^{2-n}) = M - m $$\nSolving for $\\beta$ (since $r_{1} \\neq r_{2}$ and $n \\neq 2$, the denominator is non-zero):\n$$ \\beta = \\frac{M - m}{r_{2}^{2-n} - r_{1}^{2-n}} $$\nNow, we solve for $\\alpha$ using the first equation: $\\alpha = m - \\beta r_{1}^{2-n}$.

Let us define an auxiliary function $v(x) = u(x) - b(x)$ on the closed annulus $\\overline{A_{r_{1},r_{2}}}$. The function $v$ is in $C^{2}(A_{r_{1},r_{2}}) \\cap C^{0}(\\overline{A_{r_{1},r_{2}}})$.

Therefore, $\\Delta v \\geq 0$, which means $v(x)$ is also a subharmonic function on $A_{r_{1},r_{2}}$.\n\nThe weak maximum principle for a subharmonic function on a bounded domain states that its maximum value must be achieved on the boundary of the domain.

Thus, on $S_{r_{1}}$:\n  $$ v(x) = u(x) - b(x) \\leq m - m = 0 $$\n- For $x \\in S_{r_{2}}$, we have $|x| = r_{2}$. The given condition is $u(x) \\leq M$, and by construction, $b(x) = b(r_{2}) = M$. Thus, on $S_{r_{2}}$:\n  $$ v(x) = u(x) - b(x) \\leq M - M = 0 $$\nSince $v(x) \\leq 0$ on the entire boundary $\\partial A_{r_{1},r_{2}}$, the maximum principle implies that $v(x) \\leq 0$ for all $x$ in the interior $A_{r_{1},r_{2}}$ as well.

By the dominated convergence theorem, we can interchange the limit and integral:\n$$\n\\int_0^{2\\pi} \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0} \\varphi(\\epsilon \\cos\\theta, \\epsilon \\sin\\theta) \\, d\\theta = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\varphi(0) \\, d\\theta = 2\\pi \\varphi(0)\n$$\nFor the second term, $|\\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial r}| \\le |\\nabla \\varphi|$ which is bounded on $\\Omega$, say by a constant $M$.\n$$\n\\left| \\ln(\\epsilon) \\int_{\\partial B_\\epsilon(0)} \\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial r} \\, dS \\right| = \\left| \\ln(\\epsilon) \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{\\partial \\varphi}{\\partial r}(\\epsilon,\\theta) \\, \\epsilon \\, d\\theta \\right| \\le |\\ln(\\epsilon)| \\cdot (2\\pi \\epsilon M) = 2\\pi M |\\epsilon \\ln(\\epsilon)|\n$$\nUsing L'Hôpital's rule, $\\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} \\epsilon \\ln(\\epsilon) = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} \\frac{\\ln(\\epsilon)}{1/\\epsilon} = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} \\frac{1/\\epsilon}{-1/\\epsilon^2} = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0^+} (-\\epsilon) = 0$.\nSo, the second term vanishes in the limit.\nCombining the results, we have:\n$$\n\\langle \\Delta u, \\varphi \\rangle = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\to 0} \\int_{\\Omega_\\epsilon} \\ln|x| \\Delta \\varphi \\, d^2x = 2\\pi \\varphi(0)\n$$\nThis is the definition of the distribution $2\\pi \\delta_0$, where $\\delta_0$ is the Dirac delta distribution centered at the origin. Thus, the distributional Laplacian is $\\Delta u = 2\\pi\\delta_0$. This is a Radon measure on $\\Omega$.\n\nPart 2: Why $u$ is subharmonic.\n\nA function $u \\in L^1_{\\text{loc}}(\\Omega)$ is defined to be subharmonic in the sense of distributions if its distributional Laplacian $\\Delta u$ is a non-negative distribution. A distribution $T$ is non-negative if $\\langle T, \\varphi \\rangle \\ge 0$ for all non-negative test functions $\\varphi \\in C_c^\\infty(\\Omega)$, i.e., $\\varphi(x) \\ge 0$ for all $x \\in \\Omega$.\nFrom Part 1, we found that $\\Delta u = 2\\pi \\delta_0$. Let's test this against the definition. For any non-negative test function $\\varphi \\in C_c^\\infty(\\Omega)$, we have:\n$$\n\\langle \\Delta u, \\varphi \\rangle = \\langle 2\\pi \\delta_0, \\varphi \\rangle = 2\\pi \\varphi(0)\n$$\nSince $\\varphi$ is a non-negative function, its value at any point, including the origin, must be non-negative: $\\varphi(0) \\ge 0$. The constant $2\\pi$ is positive. Therefore,\n$$\n\\langle \\Delta u, \\varphi \\rangle = 2\\pi \\varphi(0) \\ge 0\n$$\nThis holds for all non-negative $\\varphi \\in C_c^\\infty(\\Omega)$. Consequently, $\\Delta u$ is a non-negative distribution, and by definition, $u(x) = \\ln|x|$ is a subharmonic function on $\\Omega$.\n\nPart 3: Weak maximum principle and supremum of $u$.\n\nThe weak maximum principle for subharmonic functions states that if $\\Omega$ is a bounded open set in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and $u$ is a subharmonic function on $\\Omega$ which is upper semi-continuous on the closure $\\overline{\\Omega}$, then the maximum of $u$ on $\\overline{\\Omega}$ is attained on the boundary $\\partial \\Omega$. That is,\n$$\n\\sup_{x \\in \\overline{\\Omega}} u(x) = \\sup_{x \\in \\partial \\Omega} u(x)\n$$\nIn our problem, $u(x) = \\ln|x|$ and $\\Omega = B_R(0)$. The closure is $\\overline{\\Omega} = \\overline{B_R(0)}$. The function $u$ is continuous on $\\overline{\\Omega} \\setminus \\{0\\}$. At the origin, $\\lim_{x \\to 0} u(x) = -\\infty$. We can extend $u$ to be an upper semi-continuous function on all of $\\overline{\\Omega}$ by defining $u(0) = -\\infty$. This is because for any point $x_0 \\in \\overline{\\Omega}$, $\\limsup_{x\\to x_0} u(x) \\le u(x_0)$. This is trivially true for $x_0 \\neq 0$ (where equality holds) and for $x_0=0$ (since $\\limsup_{x\\to 0} u(x) = -\\infty$).\nSince $u$ is subharmonic on $\\Omega$ and upper semi-continuous on $\\overline{\\Omega}$, the weak maximum principle applies. We need to find the supremum of $u$ on the boundary $\\partial\\Omega = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : |x| = R\\}$.\nFor any point $x \\in \\partial \\Omega$, we have $|x|=R$. The value of the function is:\n$$\nu(x) = \\ln|x| = \\ln R\n$$\nThe function is constant on the boundary. Therefore, the supremum on the boundary is:\n$$\n\\sup_{x \\in \\partial \\Omega} u(x) = \\ln R\n$$\nBy the maximum principle, this is also the supremum over the entire closed disk:\n$$\n\\sup_{x \\in \\overline{\\Omega}} u(x) = \\sup_{x \\in \\partial \\Omega} u(x) = \\ln R\n$$\nThis result is intuitive, as the function $u(x) = \\ln|x|$ increases with the distance $|x|$ from the origin, reaching its maximum value on the circle furthest from the origin, which is the boundary of the disk.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2\\pi \\delta_0 & \\ln R \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3036769"}]}
