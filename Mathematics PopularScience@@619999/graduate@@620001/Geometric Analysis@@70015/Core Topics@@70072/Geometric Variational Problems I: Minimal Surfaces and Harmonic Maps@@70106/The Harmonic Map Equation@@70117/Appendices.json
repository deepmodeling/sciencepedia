It is a standard, well-posed problem in the theory of harmonic maps, a subfield of geometric analysis. All terms are clearly defined, and the setup is mathematically and scientifically sound. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe task is to find all harmonic maps from the unit circle $S^1$ to itself, and to express their energy in terms of their topological degree. A map $u: (M, g) \\to (N, h)$ is harmonic if it is a critical point of the energy functional\n$$\nE(u) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{M} |du|^2 \\, d\\operatorname{vol}_{g}\n$$\nwith respect to compactly supported variations.\n\nFirst, we express the energy functional in local coordinates.

A map $u: S^1 \\to S^1$ can be represented in these coordinates by a function $\\varphi(\\theta)$.\n\nThe squared norm of the differential, $|du|^2$, is given in local coordinates by the general formula $g^{ij} h_{\\alpha\\beta} (\\partial_i u^\\alpha)(\\partial_j u^\\beta)$. In our one-dimensional case, this simplifies significantly. We have $i=j=1$ and $\\alpha=\\beta=1$. The coordinate on the domain is $x^1 = \\theta$ and on the target is $u^1 = \\varphi$. The metric components are $g_{11}=1$, so $g^{11}=1$, and $h_{11}=1$. The partial derivatives become ordinary derivatives.\nThus,\n$$\n|du|^2 = g^{11} h_{11} \\left(\\frac{d\\varphi}{d\\theta}\\right)^2 = (1)(1)\\left(\\frac{d\\varphi}{d\\theta}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{d\\varphi}{d\\theta}\\right)^2\n$$\nThe energy functional can be written as:\n$$\nE(u) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\left(\\frac{d\\varphi}{d\\theta}\\right)^2 \\, d\\theta\n$$\nTo find the critical points, we compute the first variation of the energy.

The constant $a$ must be an integer. The constant $b$ corresponds to a rigid rotation of the target circle, which is an isometry of $(S^1, h)$. Any map of the form $\\varphi(\\theta) = d\\theta+b$ has the same energy as $\\varphi(\\theta)=d\\theta$, since energy is invariant under isometries of the target.\n\nThus, the harmonic maps $u:S^1 \\to S^1$ are precisely the maps of the form $\\varphi(\\theta) = d\\theta + b$, where $d \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ is the degree of the map and $b \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is a constant phase. Up to rotation of the target, the harmonic maps are uniquely classified by their integer degree $d$.\n\nFinally, we compute the energy of a harmonic map of degree $d$.

Notice that the energy is always non-negative and is minimized (with value $0$) for constant maps ($d=0$). This energy value, $E = \\pi d^2$, is the minimum energy within the homotopy class of maps of degree $d$.\n\nThe required expression for the energy $E$ as a function of the integer degree $d$ is $E(d) = \\pi d^2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\pi d^2}\n$$", "id": "3035474"}, {"introduction": "After establishing the basic definition, we investigate a crucial feature of the theory in dimensions $n \\ge 2$: the existence of singularities.

The tension field $\\tau(u)$ is the tangential component of the connection Laplacian, $\\Delta_M u$. Since the domain is $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with the Euclidean metric, this is just the standard component-wise Laplacian, $\\Delta u$. The vector $u(x)$ itself is the unit normal vector to the circle $S^1$ at the point $u(x)$.
