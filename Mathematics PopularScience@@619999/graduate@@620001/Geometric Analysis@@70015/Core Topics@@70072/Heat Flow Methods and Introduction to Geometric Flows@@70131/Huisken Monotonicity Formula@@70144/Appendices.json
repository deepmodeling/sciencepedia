The \"conical case\" refers to a flow where the hypersurfaces $M_t$ are cones. If $M_t$ is a cone $C_\\Lambda$ for all $t$ (which implies a stationary solution), we analyze the condition on this cone. For any point $x \\neq 0$ on a cone $C_\\Lambda$ centered at the origin, the position vector $x$ lies in the tangent space of the cone. Therefore, the component of $x$ normal to the cone is zero, i.e., $x \\cdot \\nu(x) = 0$.\n\nIn this conical case, the self-shrinker condition $H + \\frac{x \\cdot \\nu}{2(-t)} = 0$ reduces to\n$$\nH(x) = 0.\n$$\nThis means the cone must be a minimal hypersurface in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. The mean curvature $H_C$ of a cone $C_\\Lambda$ with link $\\Lambda \\subset S^n$ is related to the mean curvature $H_\\Lambda$ of the link (as a hypersurface in $S^n$) by the formula $H_C(x) = \\frac{H_\\Lambda(\\theta)}{r}$ for $x=r\\theta$.\nTherefore, the condition $H_C = 0$ is equivalent to the condition $H_\\Lambda=0$.\nA hypersurface with zero mean curvature is, by definition, a minimal hypersurface.\n\nThus, the necessary and sufficient condition, expressed as a property of the link, is that the link $\\Lambda$ must be a minimal hypersurface in the unit sphere $S^n$.
