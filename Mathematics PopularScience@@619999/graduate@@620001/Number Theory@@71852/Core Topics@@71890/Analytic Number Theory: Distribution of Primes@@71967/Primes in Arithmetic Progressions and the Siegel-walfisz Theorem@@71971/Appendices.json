No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem requires the construction and characterization of all Dirichlet characters modulo $8$. This involves analyzing the structure of the multiplicative group of units modulo $8$, building the characters, and then determining the conductor and parity for each.\n\nFirst, we identify the group of units modulo $8$. This group, denoted $\\left(\\mathbb{Z}/8\\mathbb{Z}\\right)^{\\times}$, consists of all residue classes modulo $8$ that are coprime to $8$. The set of these residues is $\\{1, 3, 5, 7\\}$. The group operation is multiplication modulo $8$. The order of the group is $\\varphi(8) = 8(1-\\frac{1}{2}) = 4$, where $\\phi$ is Euler's totient function.\n\nLet's examine the structure of this group, which we will denote as $G$.\nThe identity element is $1$.\nThe orders of the non-identity elements are:\n$3^2 \\equiv 9 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$, so the order of $3$ is $2$.\n$5^2 \\equiv 25 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$, so the order of $5$ is $2$.\n$7^2 \\equiv 49 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 8$, so the order of $7$ is $2$.\nSince every non-identity element has order $2$, the group is abelian and isomorphic to the Klein four-group, $C_2 \\times C_2$.\n\nThe character group $\\hat{G}$ of $G$ is isomorphic to $G$ itself, so there are $4$ distinct Dirichlet characters modulo $8$. A character $\\chi: G \\to \\mathbb{C}^\\times$ is a homomorphism. For any element $g \\in G$, we have $g^2 = 1$. Therefore, $\\chi(g)^2 = \\chi(g^2) = \\chi(1) = 1$, which implies that $\\chi(g)$ must be either $1$ or $-1$.\n\nWe can choose $\\{3, 5\\}$ as a set of generators for $G$, since $3 \\cdot 5 \\equiv 15 \\equiv 7 \\pmod 8$. A character $\\chi$ is completely determined by its values on these generators, $\\chi(3)$ and $\\chi(5)$. Since each of these can be $1$ or $-1$, there are $2 \\times 2 = 4$ possible characters.\n\nWe now construct the $4$ characters by assigning values to the generators:\n1.  $\\chi_a(3) = 1$, $\\chi_a(5) = 1$.\n    Values: $\\chi_a(1)=1$, $\\chi_a(3)=1$, $\\chi_a(5)=1$, $\\chi_a(7)=\\chi_a(3)\\chi_a(5)=1 \\cdot 1 = 1$.\n    The values on $\\{1,3,5,7\\}$ are $(1, 1, 1, 1)$.\n\n2.  $\\chi_b(3) = -1$, $\\chi_b(5) = 1$.\n    Values: $\\chi_b(1)=1$, $\\chi_b(3)=-1$, $\\chi_b(5)=1$, $\\chi_b(7)=\\chi_b(3)\\chi_b(5)=-1 \\cdot 1 = -1$.\n    The values on $\\{1,3,5,7\\}$ are $(1, -1, 1, -1)$.\n\n3.  $\\chi_c(3) = 1$, $\\chi_c(5) = -1$.\n    Values: $\\chi_c(1)=1$, $\\chi_c(3)=1$, $\\chi_c(5)=-1$, $\\chi_c(7)=\\chi_c(3)\\chi_c(5)=1 \\cdot (-1) = -1$.\n    The values on $\\{1,3,5,7\\}$ are $(1, 1, -1, -1)$.\n\n4.  $\\chi_d(3) = -1$, $\\chi_d(5) = -1$.\n    Values: $\\chi_d(1)=1$, $\\chi_d(3)=-1$, $\\chi_d(5)=-1$, $\\chi_d(7)=\\chi_d(3)\\chi_d(5)=(-1) \\cdot (-1) = 1$.\n    The values on $\\{1,3,5,7\\}$ are $(1, -1, -1, 1)$.\n\nNext, we determine the conductor and parity for each character and order them as specified. The parity is given by $\\chi(-1) = \\chi(7 \\pmod 8)$. The conductor is the smallest modulus $f$ of a primitive character that induces $\\chi$.\n\n**Character 1: The principal character modulo 8**\nThis is the character $\\chi_a$ with values $(1, 1, 1, 1)$.\n- Parity: $\\chi_a(-1) = \\chi_a(7) = 1$. The character is even.\n- Conductor: This character is induced by the trivial character modulo $1$, which is primitive. Therefore, its conductor is $f=1$.\n- Data: $(\\chi(1), \\chi(3), \\chi(5), \\chi(7)) = (1, 1, 1, 1)$, conductor $1$, $\\chi(-1)=1$.\n\n**Character 2: The unique nontrivial character induced from modulo 4**\nLet's check which character is induced from modulo $4$. The non-principal character $\\psi_1$ modulo $4$ is defined by $\\psi_1(1)=1$ and $\\psi_1(3)=-1$. A character $\\chi$ modulo $8$ is induced by $\\psi_1$ if $\\chi(n) = \\psi_1(n)$ for all $n$ where $\\gcd(n,8)=1$.\nLet's test our characters:\n- For $n=5$, $5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, so we must have $\\chi(5) = \\psi_1(1) = 1$. This eliminates $\\chi_c$ and $\\chi_d$.\n- We are left with $\\chi_b$. Let's verify it fully.\n$\\chi_b(1) = 1 = \\psi_1(1)$.\n$\\chi_b(3) = -1 = \\psi_1(3)$.\n$\\chi_b(5) = 1$, and since $5 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, $\\psi_1(5) = \\psi_1(1) = 1$. Match.\n$\\chi_b(7) = -1$, and since $7 \\equiv 3 \\pmod 4$, $\\psi_1(7) = \\psi_1(3) = -1$. Match.\nSo, $\\chi_b$ with values $(1, -1, 1, -1)$ is induced by $\\psi_1$ modulo $4$.\n- Conductor: The character $\\psi_1$ modulo $4$ is primitive because it is not induced from any smaller modulus (divisors $1, 2$). Thus, the conductor of $\\chi_b$ is $f=4$.\n- Parity: $\\chi_b(-1) = \\chi_b(7) = -1$. The character is odd.\n- Data: $(\\chi(1), \\chi(3), \\chi(5), \\chi(7)) = (1, -1, 1, -1)$, conductor $4$, $\\chi(-1)=-1$.\n\n**Character 3: The primitive character modulo 8 that is even**\nThe remaining characters, $\\chi_c$ and $\\chi_d$, are not induced from modulo $4$, as shown by the check on $\\chi(5)$. Since the only other proper divisors of $8$ are $1$ and $2$, from which only principal characters can be induced, $\\chi_c$ and $\\chi_d$ must be primitive modulo $8$. Their conductor is $f=8$.\nWe need the even character, meaning $\\chi(-1)=1$.\n- $\\chi_c(-1) = \\chi_c(7) = -1$. This character is odd.\n- $\\chi_d(-1) = \\chi_d(7) = 1$. This character is even.\nSo the even primitive character is $\\chi_d$ with values $(1, -1, -1, 1)$.\n- Data: $(\\chi(1), \\chi(3), \\chi(5), \\chi(7)) = (1, -1, -1, 1)$, conductor $8$, $\\chi(-1)=1$.\n\n**Character 4: The primitive character modulo 8 that is odd**\nThis must be the remaining character, $\\chi_c$. As established, it is primitive modulo $8$.\nIts parity is $\\chi_c(-1) = \\chi_c(7) = -1$, so it is odd.\nThe values are $(1, 1, -1, -1)$.\n- Data: $(\\chi(1), \\chi(3), \\chi(5), \\chi(7)) = (1, 1, -1, -1)$, conductor $8$, $\\chi(-1)=-1$.\n\nWe now assemble the final answer as a single row matrix, listing the character values, conductor, and parity value for each character in the specified order.\n\n1.

A fundamental property of characters of a finite Abelian group is that they separate points. This means for any non-identity element $g \\in G$, there exists a character $\\psi \\in \\widehat{G}$ such that $\\psi(g) \\neq 1$.\nSo, there exists a character $\\chi_0 \\in \\widehat{G}$ such that $\\chi_0(n) \\neq 1$.\nLet's consider the sum $S_q(n) = \\sum_{\\chi \\in \\widehat{G}} \\chi(n)$.

Thus, the main term of $\\psi(x, \\chi_1)$ is $0$.\n\nSubstituting these main terms into our expressions for $\\psi(x; 3, a)$:\nThe main term of $\\psi(x; 3, 1)$ is $\\frac{1}{2} (\\text{main term of } \\psi(x, \\chi_0) + \\text{main term of } \\psi(x, \\chi_1)) = \\frac{1}{2} (x + 0) = \\frac{x}{2}$.\nThe main term of $\\psi(x; 3, 2)$ is $\\frac{1}{2} (\\text{main term of } \\psi(x, \\chi_0) - \\text{main term of } \\psi(x, \\chi_1)) = \\frac{1}{2} (x - 0) = \\frac{x}{2}$.\nThis result is consistent with the main term $\\frac{x}{\\varphi(q)} = \\frac{x}{2}$ given by the Siegel-Walfisz theorem. The error for each, let's call it $E(x; 3, a)$, is bounded as stated in the SWT.\n$$ \\psi(x; 3, a) = \\frac{x}{2} + E(x; 3, a), \\quad \\text{with } |E(x; 3, a)| \\leq C_{A}\\,x\\,\\exp\\Big(-c_{A}\\,(\\ln x)^{3/5}(\\ln\\ln x)^{-1/5}\\Big). $$\n\nNext, we analyze the discrepancy $\\Delta(x) = \\psi(x; 3, 1) - \\psi(x; 3, 2)$. Using the main term and error representation:\n$$ \\Delta(x) = \\left(\\frac{x}{2} + E(x; 3, 1)\\right) - \\left(\\frac{x}{2} + E(x; 3, 2)\\right) = E(x; 3, 1) - E(x; 3, 2). $$\nUsing the triangle inequality and the SWT bound:\n$$ |\\Delta(x)| \\leq |E(x; 3, 1)| + |E(x; 3, 2)| \\leq 2\\,C_{A}\\,x\\,\\exp\\Big(-c_{A}\\,(\\ln x)^{3/5}(\\ln\\ln x)^{-1/5}\\Big). $$\nThis demonstrates that $|\\Delta(x)|$ is bounded by a quantity of the Siegel-Walfisz error form. Since this error is $o(x)$, it means $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\Delta(x)}{x} = 0$, so $\\psi(x; 3, 1)$ and $\\psi(x; 3, 2)$ are asymptotically equal. As they share the same main term $\\frac{x}{2}$, we conclude that prime powers (weighted by $\\Lambda(n)$) are equidistributed between the two reduced residue classes modulo $3$.\n\nFinally, we find an upper bound for the normalized discrepancy $\\delta(T) = \\frac{|\\Delta(x)|}{x}$ for $x = \\exp(\\exp(T))$ with $T1$.\nFrom the bound on $|\\Delta(x)|$ derived above:\n$$ \\delta(T) = \\frac{|\\Delta(x)|}{x} \\leq \\frac{1}{x} \\left( 2\\,C_{A}\\,x\\,\\exp\\Big(-c_{A}\\,(\\ln x)^{3/5}(\\ln\\ln x)^{-1/5}\\Big) \\right) = 2\\,C_{A}\\,\\exp\\Big(-c_{A}\\,(\\ln x)^{3/5}(\\ln\\ln x)^{-1/5}\\Big). $$\nNow, we substitute $x = \\exp(\\exp(T))$:\n$\\ln(x) = \\ln(\\exp(\\exp(T))) = \\exp(T)$.\n$\\ln(\\ln(x)) = \\ln(\\exp(T)) = T$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for the bound on $\\delta(T)$:\n$$ \\delta(T) \\leq 2\\,C_{A}\\,\\exp\\left(-c_{A}\\,\\left(\\exp(T)\\right)^{3/5}(T)^{-1/5}\\right) = 2\\,C_{A}\\,\\exp\\left(-c_{A}\\,\\exp\\left(\\frac{3T}{5}\\right)T^{-1/5}\\right). $$\nThis provides the simplified closed-form upper bound for $\\delta(T)$.\n\nThe final part of the problem asks for the ordered pair of the main-term expressions for $\\psi(x;3,1)$ and $\\psi(x;3,2)$. As derived, both have the same main term.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{x}{2}  \\frac{x}{2} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "3021446"}]}
