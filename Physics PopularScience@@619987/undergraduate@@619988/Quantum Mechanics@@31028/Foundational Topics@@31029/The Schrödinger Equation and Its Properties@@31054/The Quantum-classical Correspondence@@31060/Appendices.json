{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "One of the first puzzles students encounter in quantum mechanics is the apparent contradiction between the classical picture of a particle in a box and the properties of its quantum stationary states. While we classically envision a particle bouncing back and forth, the quantum expectation value for its momentum is surprisingly zero. This exercise [@problem_id:2139484] challenges you to resolve this paradox by understanding that an energy eigenstate is not a state of definite momentum but rather a standing wave, formed by an equal superposition of left-moving and right-moving components.", "problem": "A non-relativistic spinless particle of mass $m$ is confined to a one-dimensional infinite potential well of length $L$, extending from $x=0$ to $x=L$. The particle is in a stationary energy eigenstate described by the normalized wavefunction $\\Psi_n(x,t) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}} \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{iE_n t}{\\hbar}\\right)$, where $n$ is a positive integer, $E_n$ is the energy of the $n$-th state, and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.\n\nA direct calculation shows that the expectation value of the momentum, $\\langle p \\rangle$, for any such stationary state is exactly zero. This seems to contradict the classical picture of a particle in a box, which imagines the particle constantly moving and bouncing between the walls, implying it should have a non-zero momentum at almost any given time.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct physical reconciliation of the zero momentum expectation value with the classical intuition of a moving particle?\n\nA. The particle is not actually moving. The static nature of the probability density $|\\Psi_n(x,t)|^2$ for a stationary state implies that the particle is, on average, at rest, so its average momentum is zero.\n\nB. Due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, the strict confinement of the particle's position to the length $L$ forces the uncertainty in its momentum, $\\Delta p$, to be non-zero. The zero expectation value, $\\langle p \\rangle = 0$, is the only value consistent with a symmetric uncertainty about the average.\n\nC. The energy eigenstate is not a momentum eigenstate. It is a superposition of two states with equal probability, one corresponding to a particle with momentum directed to the right ($p_n > 0$) and the other to a particle with momentum directed to the left ($-p_n$). A single measurement will yield either $+p_n$ or $-p_n$, but the average over many such measurements is zero.\n\nD. The act of measuring momentum fundamentally disturbs the system. Any measurement powerful enough to determine the momentum would transfer energy to the particle, altering its state so that the measured momentum is averaged to zero after the interaction.\n\nE. The expectation value $\\langle p \\rangle = 0$ is a purely mathematical result that arises from the symmetry of the sine function used in the wavefunction. It does not correspond to a physically measurable quantity, which would be the kinetic energy of the particle, not its vector momentum.", "solution": "We begin with the stationary state in the infinite square well,\n$$\n\\Psi_{n}(x,t)=\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}}\\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{iE_{n}t}{\\hbar}\\right),\\quad 0<x<L,\n$$\nand the momentum operator in position space,\n$$\n\\hat{p}=-i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}.\n$$\nThe expectation value of momentum is\n$$\n\\langle p\\rangle=\\int_{0}^{L}\\Psi_{n}^{*}(x,t)\\left(-i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\right)\\Psi_{n}(x,t)\\,dx.\n$$\nSince the time dependence is a global phase, $\\Psi_{n}^{*}\\Psi_{n}$ is time independent and the phase cancels in $\\langle p\\rangle$.

Hence there is no net flow of probability, consistent with a standing wave.\n\nThe reconciliation with classical intuition comes from recognizing that an energy eigenstate is not a momentum eigenstate. Inside the well where $V=0$, the time-independent Schrödinger equation admits plane-wave solutions $\\exp(\\pm ikx)$ with $k=\\frac{n\\pi}{L}$ and energy $E_{n}=\\frac{\\hbar^{2}k^{2}}{2m}$. The bound-state solution can be written as the equal-amplitude superposition\n$$\n\\sin(kx)=\\frac{1}{2i}\\left[\\exp(ikx)-\\exp(-ikx)\\right],\n$$\nwhich combines a right-moving component with momentum $+p_{n}$ and a left-moving component with momentum $-p_{n}$, where $p_{n}=\\hbar k=\\frac{n\\pi\\hbar}{L}$. Because the amplitudes are equal in magnitude, the momentum-space probability distribution is symmetric, so a single ideal momentum measurement yields $+p_{n}$ or $-p_{n}$ with equal probability, and the ensemble average is $\\langle p\\rangle=0$.\n\nEquivalently, the Fourier transform of a real spatial wavefunction satisfies $\\tilde{\\Psi}(-p)=\\tilde{\\Psi}(p)^{*}$, implying $|\\tilde{\\Psi}(p)|^{2}=|\\tilde{\\Psi}(-p)|^{2}$; thus the momentum distribution is symmetric about zero. While the finite spatial support broadens each peak, the distribution remains centered at $\\pm p_{n}$ with equal weights, giving $\\langle p\\rangle=0$ but a nonzero $\\Delta p$.\n\nAddressing the options:\n- A is incorrect: a zero expectation value does not imply the particle is at rest; it indicates equal likelihood of opposite momenta, consistent with a standing wave and zero net current.\n- B misattributes the cause: the uncertainty principle enforces $\\Delta x\\,\\Delta p\\geq\\hbar/2$ but does not require $\\langle p\\rangle=0$; one can have nonzero $\\langle p\\rangle$ with the same $\\Delta p$.\n- C is correct: the energy eigenstate is an equal superposition of right- and left-moving momentum components, so measurements yield $\\pm p_{n}$ with equal probability and average to zero.\n- D is incorrect: measurement backaction is not the reason the undisturbed state has $\\langle p\\rangle=0$; the zero average is a property of the state before measurement.\n- E is incorrect: $\\langle p\\rangle$ is a physically meaningful, measurable ensemble average, not a purely mathematical artifact.\n\nTherefore, the correct reconciliation is that the stationary state is a superposition of equal and opposite momentum components, yielding zero average momentum while still allowing definite nonzero outcomes in individual measurements.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2139484"}, {"introduction": "While some quantum states seem to defy classical intuition, others provide a remarkable bridge to the classical world.
