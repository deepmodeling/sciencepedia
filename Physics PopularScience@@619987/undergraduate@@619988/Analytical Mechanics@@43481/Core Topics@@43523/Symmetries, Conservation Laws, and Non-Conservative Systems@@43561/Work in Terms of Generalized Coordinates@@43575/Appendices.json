The shape of the bowl is a paraboloid of revolution, described by the equation $z = c r^2$ in a coordinate system where the positive $z$-axis points vertically upwards. Here, $r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ is the radial distance from the $z$-axis and $c$ is a positive constant with units of inverse length. The block is subject to a constant gravitational field, represented by the acceleration due to gravity $g$, which acts in the negative $z$-direction.\n\nThe motion of the block can be described using two generalized coordinates: the radial distance $r$ and the azimuthal angle $\\phi$ (from standard cylindrical coordinates).
