A single model function is passed to the `scipy.optimize.curve_fit` routine, which estimates the parameters $(f_s, \\Omega_s, \\Omega_d)$ by minimizing the sum of squared residuals between the model and the noisy data. The fit is constrained such that $0 \\le f_s \\le 1$.\n\nAfter the fit yields the optimal parameters, the results are processed according to the specified output format: the $d$-wave fraction $f_d$ is calculated as $1 - f_s$, the two fitted peak positions are sorted so that the reported $\\Omega_s$ is the larger value, and the final numbers are rounded to the required precision. The Python code in the `answer` block implements this entire procedure.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import curve_fit\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Generates synthetic Raman spectra for a two-component superconductor model,\n    then fits the model to the noisy data to estimate the component weights and\n    pair-breaking peak positions.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define constants and shared parameters\n    OMEGA_MIN = 100.0\n    OMEGA_MAX = 500.0\n    DELTA_OMEGA = 1.0\n    omega_grid = np.arange(OMEGA_MIN, OMEGA_MAX + DELTA_OMEGA, DELTA_OMEGA)\n    \n    VERTICES = {\n        'B1g': {'s': 0.15, 'd': 1.0},\n        'B2g': {'s': 0.70, 'd': 0.35}\n    }\n    \n    GAMMA_S = 12.0\n    GAMMA_D = 16.0\n    \n    RANDOM_SEED = 12345\n    rng = np.random.default_rng(RANDOM_SEED)\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A (balanced, well-separated peaks)\n        {'w_s': 0.60, 'w_d': 0.40, 'Omega_s': 380.0, 'Omega_d': 320.0, 'eta': 0.015},\n        # Case B (strongly d-dominated)\n        {'w_s': 0.05, 'w_d': 0.95, 'Omega_s': 370.0, 'Omega_d': 300.0, 'eta': 0.010},\n        # Case C (overlapping peaks, equal weights)\n        {'w_s': 0.50, 'w_d': 0.50, 'Omega_s': 350.0, 'Omega_d': 340.0, 'eta': 0.015},\n    ]\n\n    def lorentzian(omega, Omega, Gamma):\n        \"\"\"Computes the Lorentzian lineshape.\"\"\"\n        return Gamma**2 / ((omega - Omega)**2 + Gamma**2)\n\n    def simultaneous_model(omega_cat, f_s, Omega_s, Omega_d):\n        \"\"\"\n        Global model function for simultaneous fitting across two channels.\n        The s-component is defined by Gamma_s, the d-component by Gamma_d.\n        \"\"\"\n        n_points = len(omega_grid)\n        omega = omega_cat[:n_points]  # Both channels use the same omega grid\n\n        # Calculate intensity for B1g channel\n        i_b1g = (f_s * VERTICES['B1g']['s'] * lorentzian(omega, Omega_s, GAMMA_S) +\n                 (1 - f_s) * VERTICES['B1g']['d'] * lorentzian(omega, Omega_d, GAMMA_D))\n        \n        # Calculate intensity for B2g channel\n        i_b2g = (f_s * VERTICES['B2g']['s'] * lorentzian(omega, Omega_s, GAMMA_S) +\n                 (1 - f_s) * VERTICES['B2g']['d'] * lorentzian(omega, Omega_d, GAMMA_D))\n        \n        return np.concatenate((i_b1g, i_b2g))\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        # 1.
