It is self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\nThe derivation of the statically screened electrostatic potential $\\phi(r)$ proceeds from three main principles as specified.\n\n**(i) Poisson's Equation**\nThe electrostatic potential $\\phi(\\vec{r})$ is governed by Poisson's equation. In a polarizable medium with a background dielectric constant $\\varepsilon_{b}$, this equation is:\n$$ \\nabla^2 \\phi(\\vec{r}) = -\\frac{\\rho_{tot}(\\vec{r})}{\\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon_{b}} $$\nThe total charge density, $\\rho_{tot}(\\vec{r})$, is the sum of the external charge density from the point charge $Q$, $\\rho_{ext}(\\vec{r}) = Q\\delta(\\vec{r})$, and the induced charge density from the electron gas, $\\rho_{ind}(\\vec{r})$.\n$$ \\rho_{tot}(\\vec{r}) = Q\\delta(\\vec{r}) + \\rho_{ind}(\\vec{r}) $$\nThus, Poisson's equation becomes:\n$$ \\nabla^2 \\phi(\\vec{r}) = -\\frac{Q\\delta(\\vec{r}) + \\rho_{ind}(\\vec{r})}{\\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon_{b}} $$\n\n**(ii) Induced Charge Density**\nThe induced charge density $\\rho_{ind}(\\vec{r})$ is due to the spatial redistribution of the electrons in response to the potential. If $n_{ind}(\\vec{r})$ is the induced electron number density, the induced charge density is:\n$$ \\rho_{ind}(\\vec{r}) = -e n_{ind}(\\vec{r}) $$\nwhere $-e$ is the charge of an electron and $e$ is the elementary positive charge.\n\n**(iii) Linear Response in the Thomas-Fermi Approximation**\nThe TF approximation assumes that the electron gas responds locally to the potential. At zero temperature, the system is in equilibrium when the electrochemical potential is uniform. Let the unperturbed Fermi energy be $\\varepsilon_F$. In the presence of the potential $\\phi(\\vec{r})$, an electron's potential energy is $-e\\phi(\\vec{r})$. The local kinetic energy of the highest-energy electrons must adjust to keep the total energy (electrochemical potential) constant:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{F,local}(\\vec{r}) - e\\phi(\\vec{r}) = \\varepsilon_F $$\nThis implies a local shift in the Fermi kinetic energy: $\\varepsilon_{F,local}(\\vec{r}) = \\varepsilon_F + e\\phi(\\vec{r})$. The induced electron density $n_{ind}(\\vec{r})$ is the change in the local electron density due to this shift. For a small perturbation $\\phi(\\vec{r})$, we can use a linear approximation:\n$$ n_{ind}(\\vec{r}) = n_{local}(\\vec{r}) - n_{0} \\approx \\frac{dn}{d\\varepsilon_F} (\\varepsilon_{F,local} - \\varepsilon_F) $$\nThe derivative $\\frac{dn}{d\\varepsilon_F}$ is, by definition, the density of states per unit volume at the Fermi energy, $D(\\varepsilon_F)$. Thus:\n$$ n_{ind}(\\vec{r}) = D(\\varepsilon_F) [e\\phi(\\vec{r})] $$\nCombining this with step (ii), we get the relation between induced charge and potential:\n$$ \\rho_{ind}(\\vec{r}) = -e^2 D(\\varepsilon_F) \\phi(\\vec{r}) $$\n\n**Derivation of the Screened Poisson Equation**\nSubstituting the expression for $\\rho_{ind}(\\vec{r})$ into Poisson's equation:\n$$ \\nabla^2 \\phi(\\vec{r}) = -\\frac{Q\\delta(\\vec{r})}{\\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon_{b}} - \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon_{b}} [-e^2 D(\\varepsilon_F) \\phi(\\vec{r})] $$\nRearranging the terms, we obtain the screened Poisson equation:\n$$ \\left( \\nabla^2 - \\frac{e^2 D(\\varepsilon_F)}{\\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon_{b}} \\right) \\phi(\\vec{r}) = -\\frac{Q\\delta(\\vec{r})}{\\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon_{b}} $$\nThis is of the form $(\\nabla^2 - k_{TF}^2)\\phi(\\vec{r}) = -\\frac{Q\\delta(\\vec{r})}{\\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon_{b}}$, where we identify the square of the Thomas-Fermi screening wave number as:\n$$ k_{TF}^2 = \\frac{e^2 D(\\varepsilon_F)}{\\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon_{b}} $$\nTo find the explicit form of $k_{TF}$, we need the density of states $D(\\varepsilon_F)$ for a 3D spin-degenerate free electron gas. The number of states per unit volume with wavevector magnitude less than $k$ is $n = 2 \\times \\frac{4\\pi k^3/3}{(2\\pi)^3} = \\frac{k^3}{3\\pi^2}$. The energy is $\\varepsilon = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}$, so $k = \\sqrt{2m\\varepsilon}/\\hbar$. Expressing $n$ in terms of $\\varepsilon$: $n(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{1}{3\\pi^2} (\\frac{2m\\varepsilon}{\\hbar^2})^{3/2}$.\nThe density of states per unit volume is $D(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{dn}{d\\varepsilon} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi^2}(\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2})^{3/2}\\varepsilon^{1/2}$.\nAt the Fermi energy, $\\varepsilon_F = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k_F^2}{2m}$, this becomes:\n$$ D(\\varepsilon_F) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi^2}\\left(\\frac{2m}{\\hbar^2}\\right)^{3/2} \\left(\\frac{\\hbar^2 k_F^2}{2m}\\right)^{1/2} = \\frac{m k_F}{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $k_{TF}^2$ gives the Thomas-Fermi screening wave number:\n$$ k_{TF} = \\sqrt{\\frac{e^2 m k_F}{\\pi^2 \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_b \\hbar^2}} $$\n\n**Solution for the Screened Potential $\\phi(r)$**\nFor $r > 0$, the equation is $(\\nabla^2 - k_{TF}^2)\\phi(r) = 0$. Given the spherical symmetry, the general solution is of the form $\\phi(r) = A\\frac{e^{-k_{TF}r}}{r} + B\\frac{e^{k_{TF}r}}{r}$.\nWe apply two boundary conditions:\n1. The potential must vanish at infinity: $\\phi(r \\to \\infty) = 0$. This requires $B=0$.\n2. As $r \\to 0$, the potential must approach the unscreened potential of the point charge in the background medium, $\\phi_0(r) = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0\\varepsilon_b r}$. For small $r$, $e^{-k_{TF}r} \\approx 1$, so our solution approaches $\\phi(r \\to 0) \\approx \\frac{A}{r}$. Comparing this with $\\phi_0(r)$ fixes the constant $A = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi\\varepsilon_0\\varepsilon_b}$.\n\nTherefore, the statically screened electrostatic potential in the Thomas-Fermi approximation is:\n$$ \\phi(r) = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_b r} e^{-k_{TF}r} $$\nThis is a Yukawa-type potential, describing a Coulomb interaction with an exponentially decaying range given by the screening length $\\lambda_{TF} = 1/k_{TF}$.\n\n**Qualitative Discussion: TF vs. RPA (Lindhard)**\nThe Thomas-Fermi theory yields a screened potential $\\phi(r)$ that decays monotonically and exponentially. This is a direct consequence of the TF dielectric function, $\\varepsilon_{TF}(q) = 1+k_{TF}^2/q^2$, which is a smooth, analytic function of the wave vector $q$ (for $q \\neq 0$). In Fourier analysis, a smooth, analytic function in momentum space corresponds to a well-localized function in real space, characterized here by exponential decay. The TF approximation is local and semiclassical; it effectively smooths over the sharp quantum features of the electron gas.\n\nIn contrast, a full microscopic treatment within the Random Phase Approximation (RPA) yields the static Lindhard dielectric function, $\\varepsilon_L(q)$. This function exhibits a non-analyticity at the wave vector $q=2k_F$. Specifically, its derivative, $d\\varepsilon_L/dq$, has a logarithmic singularity at $q=2k_F$. This feature is a direct consequence of the sharp, discontinuous nature of the Fermi-Dirac distribution at zero temperature ($T=0$), which creates a rigid Fermi sphere in momentum space. Scattering an electron from one side of the Fermi sphere to the other (backscattering) involves a maximum momentum transfer of $2k_F$. This creates a \"kink\" in the response function at this particular wave vector.\n\nA non-analyticity at a finite wave vector $q_0$ in momentum space leads to long-range oscillatory behavior in real space with a spatial periodicity related to $2\\pi/q_0$. For the Lindhard function, the non-analyticity at $q=2k_F$ produces long-range oscillations in the screened potential known as Friedel oscillations. At large distances, the potential decays as a power law modulated by an oscillation:\n$$ \\phi_{RPA}(r) \\propto \\frac{\\cos(2k_F r)}{r^3} \\quad (\\text{for } r \\gg 1/k_F) $$\nThe TF approximation can be recovered as the long-wavelength limit ($q \\to 0$) of the Lindhard function. In this limit, the non-analytic features at $q=2k_F$ are not captured, which is why TF theory completely misses the oscillatory Friedel screening.\n\n**Dimensionless Screening Factor $f(r)$**\nThe problem defines the dimensionless screening factor as $f(r) \\equiv \\phi(r)/\\phi_{0}(r)$. Using our derived expressions:\n- Screened potential: $\\phi(r) = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_b r} e^{-k_{TF}r}$\n- Unscreened potential: $\\phi_{0}(r) = \\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_b r}$\n\nThe ratio is:\n$$ f(r) = \\frac{\\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_b r} e^{-k_{TF}r}}{\\frac{Q}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_b r}} = e^{-k_{TF}r} $$\nSubstituting the full expression for the Thomas-Fermi screening wave number $k_{TF}$, we obtain the final analytic expression for $f(r)$:\n$$ f(r) = \\exp\\left(-r \\sqrt{\\frac{e^2 m k_F}{\\pi^2 \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_b \\hbar^2}}\\right) $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\exp\\left(-r \\sqrt{\\frac{e^2 m k_F}{\\pi^2 \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_b \\hbar^2}}\\right)}$$", "id": "3014578"}, {"introduction": "While static screening describes the system's equilibrium response, the dynamic behavior of collective excitations is equally critical.

The Particle-Hole Excitation Continuum**\n\nLandau damping occurs when a collective mode can decay into single-particle excitations, specifically electron-hole pairs. At zero temperature ($T=0$), an electron-hole pair is created by promoting an electron from an initially occupied state with wave vector $\\mathbf{k}$ to a final unoccupied state with wave vector $\\mathbf{k}'$. The process must conserve momentum and energy. If the excitation has momentum $\\hbar\\mathbf{q}$ and energy $\\hbar\\omega$, then $\\mathbf{k}' = \\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{q}$ and $\\hbar\\omega = \\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{q}} - \\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}$.\n\nThe constraints imposed by the Pauli exclusion principle at $T=0$ are:\n1. The initial state must be occupied: $|\\mathbf{k}| < k_F$, where $k_F$ is the Fermi wave number.\n2. The final state must be unoccupied: $|\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{q}| > k_F$.\n\nUsing the given parabolic dispersion relation $\\varepsilon_{\\mathbf{k}} = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}$, the excitation energy is:\n$$ \\hbar\\omega = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\left( |\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{q}|^2 - |\\mathbf{k}|^2 \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\left( k^2 + 2\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{q} + q^2 - k^2 \\right) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 q^2}{2m} + \\frac{\\hbar^2 \\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{q}}{m} $$\nLet $\\theta$ be the angle between $\\mathbf{k}$ and $\\mathbf{q}$.

The problem requires the upper boundary of this continuum, $\\omega_{+}(q)$, which is found by maximizing $\\omega$ for a fixed $q$.\n\nTo maximize $\\omega(k, \\theta)$, we must maximize the term $\\frac{\\hbar^2 kq}{m}\\cos\\theta$. This occurs when:\n- $\\cos\\theta = 1$, meaning $\\mathbf{k}$ is parallel to $\\mathbf{q}$.\n- $k$ is as large as possible, i.e., $k$ approaches $k_F$ from below.\n\nLet's check the Pauli constraints for this case. With $\\cos\\theta = 1$, the initial state constraint is $k < k_F$. The final state constraint is $|\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{q}| = k+q > k_F$. Since $k$ can be arbitrarily close to $k_F$ and $q>0$, this condition is always satisfied.\n\nTaking the limit $k \\to k_F$ with $\\cos\\theta = 1$, we obtain the maximum excitation energy at a given $q$:\n$$ \\hbar\\omega_{+}(q) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 q^2}{2m} + \\frac{\\hbar^2 k_F q}{m} $$\nIntroducing the Fermi velocity $v_F = \\frac{\\hbar k_F}{m}$, the upper boundary of the particle-hole continuum is:\n$$ \\omega_{+}(q) = \\frac{\\hbar q^2}{2m} + v_F q $$\n\n**2. The Plasmon Dispersion and Approximation at Damping Onset**\n\nThe plasmon frequency $\\omega_{\\mathrm{pl}}(q)$ is determined by the condition $\\varepsilon(q, \\omega_{\\mathrm{pl}}(q)) = 0$, where $\\varepsilon(q,\\omega)$ is the RPA dielectric function:\n$$ \\varepsilon(q,\\omega) = 1 - v(q)\\,\\chi_{0}(q,\\omega) = 0 \\implies 1 = \\frac{4\\pi e^2}{\\varepsilon_b q^2} \\chi_0(q,\\omega) $$\nIn the long-wavelength ($q \\to 0$) and high-frequency ($\\omega \\gg v_F q$) limit, the noninteracting response function $\\chi_0(q,\\omega)$ for a 3D electron gas can be expanded as:\n$$ \\chi_0(q,\\omega) \\approx \\frac{n q^2}{m \\omega^2} $$\nSubstituting this into the condition for the plasmon pole:\n$$ 1 = \\frac{4\\pi e^2}{\\varepsilon_b q^2} \\left( \\frac{n q^2}{m \\omega^2} \\right) = \\frac{4\\pi n e^2}{\\varepsilon_b m \\omega^2} $$\nUsing the definition of the bulk plasma frequency, $\\omega_p^2 = \\frac{4\\pi n e^2}{\\varepsilon_b m}$, we find:\n$$ 1 = \\frac{\\omega_p^2}{\\omega^2} \\implies \\omega^2 = \\omega_p^2 $$\nThus, the leading order term of the plasmon frequency for small $q$ is a constant, independent of $q$:\n$$ \\omega_{\\mathrm{pl}}(q \\to 0) = \\omega_p $$\nThe next term in the expansion gives the plasmon dispersion, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{pl}}(q) \\approx \\omega_p + \\alpha q^2$ where $\\alpha > 0$.\n\nLandau damping begins at the critical wave number $q_c$ where the plasmon dispersion curve first touches the particle-hole continuum, i.e., $\\omega_{\\mathrm{pl}}(q_c) = \\omega_{+}(q_c)$. The plasmon branch starts at $\\omega_{pl}(0)=\\omega_p > 0$, while the particle-hole boundary starts at $\\omega_{+}(0)=0$. The boundary $\\omega_{+}(q)$ increases with $q$, eventually intersecting the plasmon branch. Typically, in the high-density electron gas where RPA is a good approximation, the plasma energy $\\hbar\\omega_p$ is large compared to the Fermi energy $\\varepsilon_F$. The intersection condition $\\omega_{\\mathrm{pl}}(q_c) \\approx \\omega_{+}(q_c)$ leads to an estimate $q_c \\sim \\omega_p/v_F$. The ratio $q_c/k_F \\sim \\hbar\\omega_p/(2\\varepsilon_F)$ is small in the high-density limit. Since $q_c$ is small, the $q^2$ correction to the plasmon frequency is a small perturbation. Specifically, the coefficient of the $q^2$ term in the plasmon dispersion is proportional to $v_F^2/\\omega_p$, which is small compared to the coefficient $\\hbar/(2m)$ of the $q^2$ term in $\\omega_{+}(q)$. Their ratio is of order $\\varepsilon_F/(\\hbar\\omega_p) \\ll 1$. Therefore, it is a valid approximation to neglect the $q$-dependence of the plasmon frequency and use its leading-order value, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{pl}}(q_c) \\approx \\omega_p$, to determine the onset of damping.\n\n**3. The Critical Wave Number $q_c$**\n\nWe find $q_c$ by solving the equation $\\omega_{\\mathrm{pl}}(q_c) = \\omega_{+}(q_c)$ under the approximation derived above:\n$$ \\omega_p = \\frac{\\hbar q_c^2}{2m} + v_F q_c $$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $q_c$:\n$$ \\frac{\\hbar}{2m} q_c^2 + v_F q_c - \\omega_p = 0 $$\nUsing the quadratic formula for the roots $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$ q_c = \\frac{-v_F \\pm \\sqrt{v_F^2 - 4\\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2m}\\right)(-\\omega_p)}}{2\\left(\\frac{\\hbar}{2m}\\right)} = \\frac{-v_F \\pm \\sqrt{v_F^2 + \\frac{2\\hbar\\omega_p}{m}}}{\\frac{\\hbar}{m}} $$\nSince the wave number $q_c$ must be a positive quantity, we must choose the positive sign for the root:\n$$ q_c = \\frac{-v_F + \\sqrt{v_F^2 + \\frac{2\\hbar\\omega_p}{m}}}{\\frac{\\hbar}{m}} $$\nThis simplifies to the final expression for the critical wave number:\n$$ q_c = \\frac{m}{\\hbar} \\left( \\sqrt{v_F^2 + \\frac{2\\hbar\\omega_p}{m}} - v_F \\right) $$\nwhere $\\omega_p$ is understood as the positive square root of the given $\\omega_p^2$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{m}{\\hbar} \\left( \\sqrt{v_F^2 + \\frac{2\\hbar\\omega_p}{m}} - v_F \\right)} $$", "id": "3014452"}, {"introduction": "The principles of screening are not confined to simple electron gases; they are essential for understanding the electronic properties of novel materials.

The corresponding eigenvectors, or Bloch states, can be written as $\\psi_{s, \\boldsymbol{k}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ s e^{i\\theta_{\\boldsymbol{k}}} \\end{pmatrix}$, where $\\theta_{\\boldsymbol{k}}$ is the polar angle of the wave vector $\\boldsymbol{k}$.\n\nThe non-interacting polarizability $\\chi_0(\\boldsymbol{q}, \\omega)$ at zero temperature is given by the Kubo-Lindhard formula:\n$$ \\chi_0(\\boldsymbol{q}, \\omega) = g \\sum_{s,s'=\\pm 1} \\int \\frac{d^2k}{(2\\pi)^2} \\frac{f(\\epsilon_{s, \\boldsymbol{k}}) - f(\\epsilon_{s', \\boldsymbol{k}+\\boldsymbol{q}})}{\\hbar\\omega + \\epsilon_{s, \\boldsymbol{k}} - \\epsilon_{s', \\boldsymbol{k}+\\boldsymbol{q}} + i\\eta} |\\langle \\psi_{s', \\boldsymbol{k}+\\boldsymbol{q}} | \\psi_{s, \\boldsymbol{k}} \\rangle|^2 $$\nHere, $g=g_s g_v=4$ is the total degeneracy from spin and valley degrees of freedom. $f(\\epsilon) = \\Theta(\\mu - \\epsilon)$ is the Fermi-Dirac distribution at zero temperature, where $\\mu>0$ is the chemical potential. The term $|\\langle \\psi_{s', \\boldsymbol{k}+\\boldsymbol{q}} | \\psi_{s, \\boldsymbol{k}} \\rangle|^2$ is the chirality overlap factor.\n\nLet's first evaluate this overlap factor, a key feature of Dirac systems. The inner product of two eigenstates is:\n$$ \\langle \\psi_{s', \\boldsymbol{k}+\\boldsymbol{q}} | \\psi_{s, \\boldsymbol{k}} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & s' e^{-i\\theta_{\\boldsymbol{k}+\\boldsymbol{q}}} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ s e^{i\\theta_{\\boldsymbol{k}}} \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{2} (1 + ss' e^{i(\\theta_{\\boldsymbol{k}} - \\theta_{\\boldsymbol{k}+\\boldsymbol{q}})}) $$\nThe squared modulus is the overlap factor $F_{ss'}(\\boldsymbol{k}, \\boldsymbol{q})$:\n$$ F_{ss'}(\\boldsymbol{k}, \\boldsymbol{q}) = |\\langle \\psi_{s', \\boldsymbol{k}+\\boldsymbol{q}} | \\psi_{s, \\boldsymbol{k}} \\rangle|^2 = \\frac{1}{4} |1 + ss' e^{i(\\theta_{\\boldsymbol{k}} - \\theta_{\\boldsymbol{k}+\\boldsymbol{q}})}|^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ 1 + ss' \\cos(\\theta_{\\boldsymbol{k}} - \\theta_{\\boldsymbol{k}+\\boldsymbol{q}}) \\right] $$\nThe term $\\cos(\\theta_{\\boldsymbol{k}} - \\theta_{\\boldsymbol{k}+\\boldsymbol{q}})$ represents the alignment of the initial and final momentum vectors and can be written as $\\frac{\\boldsymbol{k} \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{k}+\\boldsymbol{q})}{|\\boldsymbol{k}||\\boldsymbol{k}+\\boldsymbol{q}|}$. This chirality factor governs the selection rules for scattering.\n\nFor intraband transitions ($s=s'$), the factor is $F_{s,s} = \\frac{1}{2}[1 + \\cos(\\Delta\\theta)]$. For backscattering, where $\\boldsymbol{k}+\\boldsymbol{q} \\approx -\\boldsymbol{k}$, we have $\\Delta\\theta = \\theta_{\\boldsymbol{k}} - \\theta_{\\boldsymbol{k}+\\boldsymbol{q}} \\approx \\pi$, so $\\cos(\\pi)=-1$ and $F_{s,s} \\to 0$. This signifies the famous suppression of backscattering within a band, a hallmark of the Berry phase $\\pi$ in graphene. An electron cannot reverse its momentum without flipping its pseudospin, but an intraband transition preserves the pseudospin state structure relative to momentum.\n\nFor interband transitions ($s \\neq s'$, so $ss'=-1$), the factor is $F_{s,-s} = \\frac{1}{2}[1 - \\cos(\\Delta\\theta)]$. For small momentum transfer $q \\to 0$, we have $\\boldsymbol{k}+\\boldsymbol{q} \\approx \\boldsymbol{k}$ and $\\Delta\\theta \\to 0$. In this limit, $\\cos(\\Delta\\theta) \\to 1$ and $F_{s,-s} \\to 0$. This means interband transitions are suppressed for small momentum transfer. Conversely, interband backscattering ($\\Delta\\theta = \\pi$) is maximal, as $F_{s,-s} \\to 1$.\n\nWe are interested in the static, long-wavelength limit ($\\omega = 0$, $q \\to 0$).\n$$ \\chi_0(\\boldsymbol{q} \\to \\boldsymbol{0}, \\omega = 0) = g \\lim_{\\boldsymbol{q} \\to \\boldsymbol{0}} \\sum_{s, s'} \\int \\frac{d^2k}{(2\\pi)^2} \\frac{f(\\epsilon_{s, \\boldsymbol{k}}) - f(\\epsilon_{s', \\boldsymbol{k}+\\boldsymbol{q}})}{\\epsilon_{s, \\boldsymbol{k}} - \\epsilon_{s', \\boldsymbol{k}+\\boldsymbol{q}}} F_{ss'}(\\boldsymbol{k}, \\boldsymbol{q}) $$\n\nLet's analyze the contributions from interband and intraband transitions separately in this limit.\n\nFor interband transitions ($s \\neq s'$), as $q \\to 0$, the overlap factor $F_{s,-s}(\\boldsymbol{k}, \\boldsymbol{q}) \\to 0$. The denominator $\\epsilon_{s,\\boldsymbol{k}} - \\epsilon_{-s,\\boldsymbol{k}+\\boldsymbol{q}} \\to 2s \\hbar v_F k$, which is finite for $k \\neq 0$. The numerator $f(\\epsilon_{s, \\boldsymbol{k}}) - f(\\epsilon_{-s, \\boldsymbol{k}})$ is also well-behaved. Since the overlap factor in the integrand vanishes point-wise, the interband contribution to $\\chi_0(q\\to 0, \\omega=0)$ is zero. This is a direct result of the chirality selection rule.\n\nFor intraband transitions ($s=s'$), we have two cases:\n1.  Valence band ($s = -1$): Since $\\mu>0$, the valence band energies $\\epsilon_{-,k} = -\\hbar v_F k$ are all below $\\mu$. Thus, $f(\\epsilon_{-,k}) = 1$ for all $\\boldsymbol{k}$. For sufficiently small $q$, $f(\\epsilon_{-,k+q})$ will also be $1$. The numerator $f(\\epsilon_{-, \\boldsymbol{k}}) - f(\\epsilon_{-, \\boldsymbol{k}+\\boldsymbol{q}})$ is therefore zero, and the fully occupied valence band does not contribute to the static polarizability.\n2.  Conduction band ($s = +1$): The Fermi surface exists in this band at $k_F = \\mu/(\\hbar v_F)$. The expression becomes:\n$$ \\chi_0(q \\to 0, 0) = g \\lim_{q \\to 0} \\int \\frac{d^2k}{(2\\pi)^2} \\frac{f(\\epsilon_{+, \\boldsymbol{k}}) - f(\\epsilon_{+, \\boldsymbol{k}+\\boldsymbol{q}})}{\\epsilon_{+, \\boldsymbol{k}} - \\epsilon_{+, \\boldsymbol{k}+\\boldsymbol{q}}} F_{++}(\\boldsymbol{k}, \\boldsymbol{q}) $$\nIn the limit $q \\to 0$, the overlap factor $F_{++}(\\boldsymbol{k},q) \\to \\frac{1}{2}(1 + \\cos(0)) = 1$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$ \\chi_0(q \\to 0, 0) = g \\int \\frac{d^2k}{(2\\pi)^2} \\frac{\\partial f(\\epsilon_{+,k})}{\\partial \\epsilon_{+,k}} $$\nAt zero temperature, the derivative of the Fermi function is a delta function: $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\epsilon} = -\\delta(\\epsilon-\\mu)$.\n$$ \\chi_0(q \\to 0, 0) = -g \\int \\frac{d^2k}{(2\\pi)^2} \\delta(\\epsilon_{+,k} - \\mu) $$\nThe integral term is the density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level for a single spin and valley, $D(\\mu)$.\nThus, $\\chi_0(q \\to 0, 0) = -g D(\\mu)$.\n\nTo find $D(\\mu)$, we first calculate the number of states $N(E)$ per spin/valley with energy less than $E>0$. This corresponds to states within a circle of radius $k=E/(\\hbar v_F)$ in $k$-space.\n$$ N(E) = \\int_{|\\boldsymbol{k}|<E/(\\hbar v_F)} \\frac{d^2k}{(2\\pi)^2} = \\frac{1}{4\\pi^2} (\\pi k^2) = \\frac{k^2}{4\\pi} = \\frac{E^2}{4\\pi(\\hbar v_F)^2} $$\nThe DOS per spin/valley is the derivative of $N(E)$ with respect to energy:\n$$ D(E) = \\frac{dN(E)}{dE} = \\frac{d}{dE} \\left( \\frac{E^2}{4\\pi(\\hbar v_F)^2} \\right) = \\frac{2E}{4\\pi(\\hbar v_F)^2} = \\frac{E}{2\\pi(\\hbar v_F)^2} $$\nEvaluating the DOS at the Fermi level $E=\\mu$:\n$$ D(\\mu) = \\frac{\\mu}{2\\pi(\\hbar v_F)^2} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the polarizability, we obtain the final result:\n$$ \\chi_{0}^{\\text{Dirac}}(q \\to 0, \\omega = 0) = -g D(\\mu) = -g \\frac{\\mu}{2\\pi(\\hbar v_F)^2} $$\nThis result, the total density of states at the Fermi level (with a negative sign), is a standard outcome for the static long-wavelength screening properties of a degenerate electron gas. In graphene, the linear dispersion leads to a DOS that is linear in energy. The suppression of interband transitions at low $q$ due to chirality is essential for this simple intraband-dominated result.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-g \\frac{\\mu}{2\\pi(\\hbar v_{F})^{2}}}$$", "id": "3014488"}]}
