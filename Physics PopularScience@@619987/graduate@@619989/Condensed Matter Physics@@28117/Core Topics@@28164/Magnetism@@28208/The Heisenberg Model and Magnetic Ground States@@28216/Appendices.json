A single magnetic mode is observed, corresponding to an excitation from a **nondegenerate ground state** to a **threefold degenerate excited state**. Our analysis shows that the singlet state ($s=0$) is nondegenerate and the triplet state ($s=1$) is threefold degenerate. Therefore, the experiment observes a transition from the singlet to the triplet (or vice versa).

No rounding is required.", "solution": "The solution proceeds in two parts. First, we identify the exact ground state of the Hamiltonian and calculate the spontaneous magnetization from it. Second, we use spin-wave theory to analyze the role of quantum fluctuations.\n\nPart 1: Ground State and Spontaneous Magnetization\n\nThe Hamiltonian for the system is given by $\\hat{H} = -J \\sum_{\\langle i j \\rangle} \\hat{\\mathbf{S}}_{i}\\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{S}}_{j}$, where $J>0$ indicates a ferromagnetic interaction. To find the ground state, we seek the state that minimizes the energy. This is equivalent to maximizing the value of each term $\\hat{\\mathbf{S}}_{i}\\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{S}}_{j}$ for every nearest-neighbor pair $\\langle i j \\rangle$.\n\nLet us consider the fully polarized ferromagnetic state, $|\\text{FM}\\rangle$, where all spins are aligned in the $+\\hat{z}$ direction, as selected by the infinitesimal external field. In this state, every spin has its maximum projection along the $z$-axis, i.e., $\\hat{S}^z_i |\\text{FM}\\rangle = S |\\text{FM}\\rangle$ for all sites $i$. For the given problem, $S=\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nWe will demonstrate that $|\\text{FM}\\rangle$ is an exact eigenstate of the Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}$. We expand the dot product:\n$$\n\\hat{\\mathbf{S}}_{i}\\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{S}}_{j} = \\hat{S}^z_i \\hat{S}^z_j + \\frac{1}{2}(\\hat{S}^+_i \\hat{S}^-_j + \\hat{S}^-_i \\hat{S}^+_j)\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{S}^{\\pm}_i = \\hat{S}^x_i \\pm i\\hat{S}^y_i$ are the spin ladder operators. The raising operator $\\hat{S}^+_i$ annihilates a state where the spin $i$ is maximally polarized up: $\\hat{S}^+_i |\\text{FM}\\rangle = 0$. Consequently, for any pair $\\langle i j \\rangle$, the term $\\hat{S}^-_i \\hat{S}^+_j$ acting on $|\\text{FM}\\rangle$ yields zero:\n$$\n\\hat{S}^-_i \\hat{S}^+_j |\\text{FM}\\rangle = \\hat{S}^-_i (0) = 0\n$$\nThe term $\\hat{S}^+_i \\hat{S}^-_j$ also gives zero because the sum is over nearest neighbors, meaning $i \\neq j$. The operator $\\hat{S}^-_j$ flips the spin at site $j$, creating a state orthogonal to $|\\text{FM}\\rangle$. The subsequent operator $\\hat{S}^+_i$ acts on spin $i$, which is still in the state $|S, S\\rangle$, and thus annihilates it. Therefore, $\\hat{S}^+_i \\hat{S}^-_j |\\text{FM}\\rangle = 0$ for $i \\neq j$.\n\nOnly the $\\hat{S}^z_i \\hat{S}^z_j$ term contributes. Applying the Hamiltonian to $|\\text{FM}\\rangle$:\n$$\n\\hat{H} |\\text{FM}\\rangle = -J \\sum_{\\langle i j \\rangle} \\hat{S}^z_i \\hat{S}^z_j |\\text{FM}\\rangle = -J \\sum_{\\langle i j \\rangle} (S \\cdot S) |\\text{FM}\\rangle = -J S^2 \\sum_{\\langle i j \\rangle} 1 \\cdot |\\text{FM}\\rangle\n$$\nIf there are $N$ sites and the coordination number is $z$, the number of nearest-neighbor pairs is $\\frac{Nz}{2}$. The energy of this state is $E_0 = -J S^2 \\frac{Nz}{2}$. Since the maximum possible eigenvalue of $\\hat{\\mathbf{S}}_{i}\\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{S}}_{j}$ for a pair of spins is $S^2$ (achieved when they are parallel), and $|\\text{FM}\\rangle$ is the state in which all pairs achieve this maximum simultaneously, it must be the ground state.\n\nThe zero-temperature spontaneous magnetization per site, $M_s(0)$, is the expectation value of the magnetization operator per site, $\\hat{M}_z = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_i g \\mu_B \\hat{S}^z_i$, in the ground state:\n$$\nM_s(0) = \\langle \\text{FM} | \\hat{M}_z | \\text{FM} \\rangle = \\frac{g \\mu_B}{N} \\sum_i \\langle \\text{FM} | \\hat{S}^z_i | \\text{FM} \\rangle\n$$\nSince $\\hat{S}^z_i |\\text{FM}\\rangle = S |\\text{FM}\\rangle$ for all $i$:\n$$\nM_s(0) = \\frac{g \\mu_B}{N} \\sum_i S = \\frac{g \\mu_B}{N} (NS) = g \\mu_B S\n$$\nSubstituting the given values $g=2$ and $S=\\frac{1}{2}$:\n$$\nM_s(0) = (2) \\mu_B \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\mu_B\n$$\nThe magnetization per site, in units of $\\mu_B$, is $1$.\n\nPart 2: Justification via Spin-Wave Theory\n\nQuantum fluctuations can, in principle, reduce the ordered moment from its classical value. We analyze this using linear spin-wave theory, which is the leading order in a $\\frac{1}{S}$ expansion. We introduce bosonic operators via the Holstein-Primakoff transformation, expanding around the fully polarized ferromagnetic ground state:\n$$\n\\hat{S}^z_i = S - a_i^\\dagger a_i\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{S}^+_i = \\sqrt{2S} \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a_i^\\dagger a_i}{2S}} a_i \\approx \\sqrt{2S} a_i\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{S}^-_i = \\sqrt{2S} a_i^\\dagger \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a_i^\\dagger a_i}{2S}} \\approx \\sqrt{2S} a_i^\\dagger\n$$\nwhere $a_i$ and $a_i^\\dagger$ are bosonic annihilation and creation operators at site $i$. The operator $a_i^\\dagger a_i$ counts the number of spin deviations (magnons) at site $i$.\n\nSubstituting these into the Hamiltonian and keeping terms up to quadratic order in the operators:\n$$\n\\hat{\\mathbf{S}}_{i}\\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{S}}_{j} \\approx (S - a_i^\\dagger a_i)(S - a_j^\\dagger a_j) + \\frac{1}{2}((\\sqrt{2S}a_i)(\\sqrt{2S}a_j^\\dagger) + (\\sqrt{2S}a_i^\\dagger)(\\sqrt{2S}a_j))\n$$\n$$\n\\approx S^2 - S(a_i^\\dagger a_i + a_j^\\dagger a_j) + S(a_i a_j^\\dagger + a_i^\\dagger a_j)\n$$\nSince $i \\neq j$ for nearest neighbors, $[a_i, a_j^\\dagger] = 0$. We can rewrite this as:\n$$\n\\hat{\\mathbf{S}}_{i}\\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{S}}_{j} \\approx S^2 - S(a_i^\\dagger a_i + a_j^\\dagger a_j - a_i^\\dagger a_j - a_j^\\dagger a_i) = S^2 - S(a_i^\\dagger - a_j^\\dagger)(a_i - a_j)\n$$\nThe Hamiltonian becomes:\n$$\n\\hat{H} \\approx -J \\sum_{\\langle i j \\rangle} \\left[ S^2 - S(a_i^\\dagger - a_j^\\dagger)(a_i - a_j) \\right] = E_0 + JS \\sum_{\\langle i j \\rangle} (a_i^\\dagger a_i + a_j^\\dagger a_j - a_i^\\dagger a_j - a_j^\\dagger a_i)\n$$\nBy performing a Fourier transform, $a_j = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} e^{i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r}_j} a_{\\mathbf{k}}$, the quadratic part of the Hamiltonian is diagonalized:\n$$\n\\hat{H}_{SW} = \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} \\hbar\\omega_{\\mathbf{k}} a_{\\mathbf{k}}^\\dagger a_{\\mathbf{k}}\n$$\nwhere $\\hbar\\omega_{\\mathbf{k}} = JSz(1-\\gamma_{\\mathbf{k}})$ is the magnon dispersion relation, with $z$ being the coordination number and $\\gamma_{\\mathbf{k}} = \\frac{1}{z} \\sum_{\\boldsymbol{\\delta}} e^{i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\delta}}$ where $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}$ are the nearest-neighbor vectors.\n\nThe crucial point is that the ferromagnetic spin-wave Hamiltonian is already diagonal in the magnon number operators $a_{\\mathbf{k}}^\\dagger a_{\\mathbf{k}}$. There are no \"anomalous\" terms such as $a_{\\mathbf{k}}a_{-\\mathbf{k}}$ or $a_{\\mathbf{k}}^\\dagger a_{-\\mathbf{k}}^\\dagger$. The ground state of this quadratic Hamiltonian is the magnon vacuum, $|0\\rangle_{SW}$, defined by $a_{\\mathbf{k}} |0\\rangle_{SW} = 0$ for all $\\mathbf{k}$. This corresponds to a state with no spin deviations.\n\nThe reduction in magnetization at $T=0$ is given by the ground-state expectation value of the total number of spin deviations.\n$$\n\\Delta S^z(0) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_i \\langle \\hat{S}^z_i \\rangle - S = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_i \\langle S - a_i^\\dagger a_i \\rangle - S = - \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_i \\langle a_i^\\dagger a_i \\rangle_0\n$$\nThe expectation value is taken in the ground state $|0\\rangle_{SW}$:\n$$\n\\langle a_i^\\dagger a_i \\rangle_0 = \\langle 0 |_{SW} a_i^\\dagger a_i | 0 \\rangle_{SW} = \\langle 0 |_{SW} \\left( \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}, \\mathbf{k}'} e^{i(\\mathbf{k}-\\mathbf{k}')\\cdot\\mathbf{r}_i} a_{\\mathbf{k}'}^\\dagger a_{\\mathbf{k}} \\right) | 0 \\rangle_{SW} = 0\n$$\nsince $\\langle 0 |_{SW} a_{\\mathbf{k}'}^\\dagger a_{\\mathbf{k}} | 0 \\rangle_{SW} = 0$ for all $\\mathbf{k}, \\mathbf{k}'$. Therefore, $\\Delta S^z(0) = 0$. To the leading order of spin-wave theory, there are no zero-point quantum fluctuations that reduce the spontaneous magnetization. This is a direct consequence of the fact that the fully polarized state is an exact eigenstate of the Hamiltonian.\n\nContrast with Antiferromagnets:\nThe situation is fundamentally different for an antiferromagnet ($J<0$ in our notation, or $J>0$ if $\\hat{H}=+J \\sum \\hat{\\mathbf{S}}_{i}\\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{S}}_{j}$). The classical ground state is the Néel state (e.g., $|\\uparrow\\downarrow\\uparrow\\downarrow \\dots \\rangle$), which is not an eigenstate of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian. Applying the transverse term $\\hat{S}^+_i \\hat{S}^-_j$ to an antiparallel pair flips both spins, changing the state.\nBecause the classical state is not an eigenstate, the true ground state is a quantum superposition containing fluctuations away from the perfect Néel order. In the corresponding spin-wave theory (using two boson species for the two sublattices, $a_{\\mathbf{k}}$ and $b_{\\mathbf{k}}$), the quadratic Hamiltonian contains anomalous terms of the form $B_{\\mathbf{k}}(a_{\\mathbf{k}}b_{-\\mathbf{k}} + a_{\\mathbf{k}}^\\dagger b_{-\\mathbf{k}}^\\dagger)$, which create and annihilate pairs of magnons. To diagonalize this Hamiltonian, a Bogoliubov transformation is required, which mixes creation and annihilation operators. The resulting true ground state (the Bogoliubov vacuum) contains a finite density of original magnons, i.e., the ground-state expectation value $\\langle a_{\\mathbf{k}}^\\dagger a_{\\mathbf{k}} \\rangle_0 = v_{\\mathbf{k}}^2 \\neq 0$, where $v_{\\mathbf{k}}$ is a Bogoliubov coefficient. This finite occupation at $T=0$ leads to a non-zero reduction of the sublattice magnetization, $\\Delta S^z > 0$.\n\nIn summary, the absence of zero-point reduction in the ferromagnet stems from its ground state being a true eigenstate, which manifests in a spin-wave Hamiltonian that is diagonal in the magnon number operators without the need for a Bogoliubov transformation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "2865507"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice introduces the crucial concept of frustration, where competing interactions prevent the formation of a simple, fully ordered ground state.

The interaction term becomes:\n$$\n\\mathbf{S}_0 \\cdot \\mathbf{S}_j = S^2 \\cos(\\mathbf{Q}\\cdot(\\mathbf{0} - \\boldsymbol{\\delta})) = S^2 \\cos(-\\mathbf{Q}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\delta}) = S^2 \\cos(\\mathbf{Q}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\delta})\n$$\nThe energy per site can now be written as a sum over these displacement vectors:\n$$\n\\frac{E(\\mathbf{Q})}{N} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ J_1 S^2 \\sum_{\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_{\\mathrm{NN}}} \\cos(\\mathbf{Q}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_{\\mathrm{NN}}) + J_2 S^2 \\sum_{\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_{\\mathrm{NNN}}} \\cos(\\mathbf{Q}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_{\\mathrm{NNN}}) \\right]\n$$\n\nLet the lattice constant be $a=1$. The neighbor vectors for a square lattice are:\n- Nearest-Neighbors (NN): $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_{\\mathrm{NN}} \\in \\{(1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)\\}$. There are $z_1=4$ such neighbors.\n- Next-Nearest-Neighbors (NNN): $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_{\\mathrm{NNN}} \\in \\{(1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1)\\}$. There are $z_2=4$ such neighbors.\n\nWe now evaluate the sums.\nFor nearest-neighbors:\n$$\n\\sum_{\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_{\\mathrm{NN}}} \\cos(\\mathbf{Q}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_{\\mathrm{NN}}) = \\cos(q_x) + \\cos(-q_x) + \\cos(q_y) + \\cos(-q_y) = 2\\cos(q_x) + 2\\cos(q_y)\n$$\nFor next-nearest-neighbors:\n$$\n\\sum_{\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_{\\mathrm{NNN}}} \\cos(\\mathbf{Q}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_{\\mathrm{NNN}}) = \\cos(q_x+q_y) + \\cos(q_x-q_y) + \\cos(-q_x+q_y) + \\cos(-q_x-q_y)\n$$\nUsing $\\cos(-A)=\\cos(A)$ and $\\cos(A+B)+\\cos(A-B) = 2\\cos A \\cos B$:\n$$\n\\sum_{\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_{\\mathrm{NNN}}} \\cos(\\mathbf{Q}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_{\\mathrm{NNN}}) = 2(\\cos(q_x+q_y) + \\cos(q_x-q_y)) = 2(2\\cos(q_x)\\cos(q_y)) = 4\\cos(q_x)\\cos(q_y)\n$$\nSubstituting these sums back into the expression for the energy per site:\n$$\n\\frac{E(\\mathbf{Q})}{N} = \\frac{S^2}{2} \\left[ J_1(2\\cos(q_x) + 2\\cos(q_y)) + J_2(4\\cos(q_x)\\cos(q_y)) \\right]\n$$\nThis simplifies to the final expression for the classical energy per site for a spiral configuration:\n$$\n\\frac{E(\\mathbf{Q})}{N} = S^2 \\left[ J_1(\\cos(q_x) + \\cos(q_y)) + 2J_2\\cos(q_x)\\cos(q_y) \\right]\n$$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\n### Part 2: Numerical Minimization\n\nThe classical ground state corresponds to the wavevector $\\mathbf{Q}=(q_x, q_y)$ that minimizes this energy function $E(\\mathbf{Q})/N$. The program will find this minimum by evaluating the derived energy function on a fine, uniform grid over the first Brillouin zone, defined by $q_x, q_y \\in [-\\pi, \\pi]$. A large number of grid points is used to ensure the minimum is located with sufficient accuracy.\n\nAfter calculating the energy for every $(\\mathbf{q}_x, \\mathbf{q}_y)$ pair on the grid, the minimum energy value is identified. All grid points yielding this minimum energy (within a small numerical tolerance $\\epsilon = 10^{-12}$) are collected as candidates. The problem specifies a deterministic tie-breaking rule: from the set of candidate wavevectors, the one with the lexicographically smallest pair $(q_x, q_y)$ is chosen as the unique solution. The program implements this by sorting the candidate vectors and selecting the first one. This procedure yields the ground state wavevector and energy for each specified set of parameters $(J_1, J_2)$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the classical ground state wavevector and energy for the J1-J2\n    Heisenberg model on a 2D square lattice for several parameter sets.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        # (J1, J2)\n        (1.0, 0.3),\n        (1.0, 0.6),\n        (1.0, 0.5),\n        (-1.0, 0.3),\n        (0.0, 1.0),\n    ]\n\n    # Parameters from the problem\n    S = 1.0\n    epsilon = 1e-12\n\n    # Grid setup for minimizing the energy function.\n    # A fine grid ensures accuracy in finding the minimum.
