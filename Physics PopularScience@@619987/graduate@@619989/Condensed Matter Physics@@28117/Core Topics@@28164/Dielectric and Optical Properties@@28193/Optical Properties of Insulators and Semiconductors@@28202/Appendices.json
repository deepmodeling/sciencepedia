There exists a minor terminological inconsistency in describing the material as both \"polar\" and \"centrosymmetric.\" By formal crystallographic definition, polar crystals must lack a center of symmetry and are thus non-centrosymmetric. However, in the context of lattice dynamics, the term \"polar material\" is often used more broadly to describe ionic crystals where optical phonon modes are infrared-active due to a non-zero Born effective charge. These modes induce a dynamic polarization, leading to a splitting between the longitudinal and transverse optical phonon frequencies. This phenomenon occurs in both non-centrosymmetric (e.g., $\\mathrm{GaAs}$) and centrosymmetric (e.g., $\\mathrm{NaCl}$) ionic crystals. We proceed by interpreting \"polar\" in this latter, physical sense, which is consistent with the provided data and the question's focus on the Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation.\n\nThe task is to deduce the relationship between the static dielectric constant $\\epsilon(0)$, the high-frequency dielectric constant $\\epsilon(\\infty)$, the transverse optical phonon frequency $\\omega_{\\mathrm{TO}}$, and the longitudinal optical phonon frequency $\\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}}$. This relationship, known as the Lyddane-Sachs-Teller (LST) relation, can be derived by modeling the frequency-dependent dielectric function $\\epsilon(\\omega)$ of the material.\n\nThe dielectric function links the electric displacement field $\\mathbf{D}$ to the electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ via $\\mathbf{D}(\\omega) = \\epsilon_0 \\epsilon(\\omega) \\mathbf{E}(\\omega)$, where $\\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space. The displacement field is also defined as $\\mathbf{D} = \\epsilon_0 \\mathbf{E} + \\mathbf{P}$, where $\\mathbf{P}$ is the macroscopic polarization. The polarization arises from two main contributions: the distortion of electron clouds ($\\mathbf{P}_{\\mathrm{el}}$) and the displacement of ions in the lattice ($\\mathbf{P}_{\\mathrm{ion}}$). Thus, $\\mathbf{P} = \\mathbf{P}_{\\mathrm{el}} + \\mathbf{P}_{\\mathrm{ion}}$.\n\nAt very high frequencies ($\\omega \\to \\infty$), well above the phonon resonances but below electronic transition frequencies, the massive ions cannot respond to the oscillating field, so $\\mathbf{P}_{\\mathrm{ion}} \\to 0$. The response is purely electronic, and the dielectric function is defined as $\\epsilon(\\infty)$. The electronic polarization is thus given by $\\mathbf{P}_{\\mathrm{el}} = \\epsilon_0(\\epsilon(\\infty) - 1)\\mathbf{E}$. We assume this electronic response is constant over the frequency range of interest.\n\nFor the ionic contribution, we model the single infrared-active optical mode as a simple harmonic oscillator. Let $\\mathbf{u}$ be the relative displacement coordinate of the ions. In an electric field $\\mathbf{E}$, the equation of motion for $\\mathbf{u}$, neglecting damping, is:\n$$ M \\left( \\frac{d^2\\mathbf{u}}{dt^2} + \\omega_{\\mathrm{TO}}^2 \\mathbf{u} \\right) = q^* \\mathbf{E} $$\nHere, $M$ is the reduced mass of the ion pair, $q^*$ is the Born effective charge, and $\\omega_{\\mathrm{TO}}$ is the natural resonant frequency of the transverse optical mode, determined by short-range interatomic forces. Assuming a harmonic time dependence of the form $e^{-i\\omega t}$, the equation becomes:\n$$ M(-\\omega^2 + \\omega_{\\mathrm{TO}}^2)\\mathbf{u}(\\omega) = q^* \\mathbf{E}(\\omega) $$\nThe displacement is then $\\mathbf{u}(\\omega) = \\frac{q^*}{M(\\omega_{\\mathrm{TO}}^2 - \\omega^2)} \\mathbf{E}(\\omega)$.\nThe ionic polarization is proportional to this displacement: $\\mathbf{P}_{\\mathrm{ion}} = Nq^*\\mathbf{u}$, where $N$ is the density of ion pairs.\n$$ \\mathbf{P}_{\\mathrm{ion}}(\\omega) = \\frac{N(q^*)^2}{M(\\omega_{\\mathrm{TO}}^2 - \\omega^2)} \\mathbf{E}(\\omega) $$\nThe total polarization is $\\mathbf{P}(\\omega) = \\mathbf{P}_{\\mathrm{el}}(\\omega) + \\mathbf{P}_{\\mathrm{ion}}(\\omega)$. From the definition $\\mathbf{P} = \\epsilon_0(\\epsilon(\\omega) - 1)\\mathbf{E}$, we have:\n$$ \\epsilon_0(\\epsilon(\\omega) - 1)\\mathbf{E} = \\epsilon_0(\\epsilon(\\infty) - 1)\\mathbf{E} + \\frac{N(q^*)^2}{M(\\omega_{\\mathrm{TO}}^2 - \\omega^2)}\\mathbf{E} $$\nDividing by $\\epsilon_0 \\mathbf{E}$ gives the frequency-dependent dielectric function:\n$$ \\epsilon(\\omega) = \\epsilon(\\infty) + \\frac{N(q^*)^2}{\\epsilon_0 M (\\omega_{\\mathrm{TO}}^2 - \\omega^2)} $$\nTo eliminate the unknown material parameters $N$, $q^*$, and $M$, we evaluate this expression in the static limit ($\\omega \\to 0$):\n$$ \\epsilon(0) = \\epsilon(\\infty) + \\frac{N(q^*)^2}{\\epsilon_0 M \\omega_{\\mathrm{TO}}^2} $$\nThis allows us to express the group of constants as $\\frac{N(q^*)^2}{\\epsilon_0 M} = (\\epsilon(0) - \\epsilon(\\infty))\\omega_{\\mathrm{TO}}^2$. Substituting this back into the expression for $\\epsilon(\\omega)$ yields:\n$$ \\epsilon(\\omega) = \\epsilon(\\infty) + \\frac{(\\epsilon(0) - \\epsilon(\\infty))\\omega_{\\mathrm{TO}}^2}{\\omega_{\\mathrm{TO}}^2 - \\omega^2} $$\nThis equation describes the dielectric response of a material with a single optical phonon resonance. Transverse optical modes correspond to the poles of $\\epsilon(\\omega)$, which occur at $\\omega = \\omega_{\\mathrm{TO}}$.\n\nLongitudinal optical (LO) modes are collective oscillations where the polarization is parallel to the wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$. For such a longitudinal wave, Maxwell's equations require that $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = 0$, implying the absence of a magnetic field. With no free charges, the relevant equation is $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{D} = 0$. Substituting $\\mathbf{D} = \\epsilon_0 \\epsilon(\\omega) \\mathbf{E}$, we get $\\epsilon_0 \\epsilon(\\omega) (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E}) = 0$. For a non-trivial longitudinal electric field, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} \\neq 0$. Therefore, a longitudinal mode can exist only at frequencies $\\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}}$ where the dielectric function is zero: a longitudinal mode is a zero of $\\epsilon(\\omega)$.\n$$ \\epsilon(\\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}}) = 0 $$\nWe set our expression for $\\epsilon(\\omega)$ to zero at $\\omega = \\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}}$:\n$$ 0 = \\epsilon(\\infty) + \\frac{(\\epsilon(0) - \\epsilon(\\infty))\\omega_{\\mathrm{TO}}^2}{\\omega_{\\mathrm{TO}}^2 - \\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}}^2} $$\nRearranging the terms:\n$$ -\\epsilon(\\infty) = \\frac{(\\epsilon(0) - \\epsilon(\\infty))\\omega_{\\mathrm{TO}}^2}{\\omega_{\\mathrm{TO}}^2 - \\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}}^2} $$\n$$ \\epsilon(\\infty)(\\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}}^2 - \\omega_{\\mathrm{TO}}^2) = (\\epsilon(0) - \\epsilon(\\infty))\\omega_{\\mathrm{TO}}^2 $$\n$$ \\epsilon(\\infty)\\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}}^2 - \\epsilon(\\infty)\\omega_{\\mathrm{TO}}^2 = \\epsilon(0)\\omega_{\\mathrm{TO}}^2 - \\epsilon(\\infty)\\omega_{\\mathrm{TO}}^2 $$\n$$ \\epsilon(\\infty)\\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}}^2 = \\epsilon(0)\\omega_{\\mathrm{TO}}^2 $$\nThis leads to the Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation:\n$$ \\frac{\\epsilon(0)}{\\epsilon(\\infty)} = \\frac{\\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}}^2}{\\omega_{\\mathrm{TO}}^2} = \\left(\\frac{\\omega_{\\mathrm{LO}}}{\\omega_{\\mathrm{TO}}}\\right)^2 $$\nThis is the required expression.

The wave equation for the electric field $\\vec{E}$ is derived from Faraday's and Ampere's laws:\n$$ \\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\vec{E}) = - \\frac{\\partial(\\nabla \\times \\vec{B})}{\\partial t} = - \\mu_0\\frac{\\partial^2 \\vec{D}}{\\partial t^2} $$\nUsing the constitutive relation $\\vec{D} = \\epsilon_0 \\epsilon(\\omega) \\vec{E}$ and the identity $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\vec{E}) = \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E}) - \\nabla^2 \\vec{E}$, and noting that $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{D} = 0$ implies $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{E} = 0$ in the medium, we obtain the Helmholtz equation:\n$$ \\nabla^2 \\vec{E} + \\frac{\\omega^2 \\epsilon(\\omega)}{c^2} \\vec{E} = 0 $$\nwhere $c = 1/\\sqrt{\\epsilon_0 \\mu_0}$ is the speed of light in vacuum.\nFor a monochromatic plane wave of frequency $\\omega$ propagating in the $z$-direction, $\\vec{E}(\\vec{r}, t) = \\vec{E}_0 \\exp(i(kz - \\omega t))$, the wave equation requires the wave number $k$ to satisfy $k^2 = \\frac{\\omega^2 \\epsilon(\\omega)}{c^2}$.\n\nIn the vacuum region ($z<0$), $\\epsilon(\\omega)=1$, and the wave number is $k_v = \\omega/c$. The fields are a superposition of incident and reflected waves:\n$$ \\vec{E}(z<0, t) = \\hat{x} \\left( E_{0i} e^{i(k_v z - \\omega t)} + E_{0r} e^{i(-k_v z - \\omega t)} \\right) $$\n$$ \\vec{B}(z<0, t) = \\hat{y} \\frac{1}{c} \\left( E_{0i} e^{i(k_v z - \\omega t)} - E_{0r} e^{i(-k_v z - \\omega t)} \\right) $$\nWe have chosen the polarization of the electric field to be along the $x$-axis without loss of generality for normal incidence.\n\nIn the insulator ($z>0$), the wave number is complex: $k_m = \\frac{\\omega}{c}\\sqrt{\\epsilon(\\omega)} \\equiv \\frac{\\omega}{c}n(\\omega)$, where $n(\\omega)=\\sqrt{\\epsilon(\\omega)} \\equiv n_1(\\omega) + i n_2(\\omega)$ is the complex refractive index. The field is a transmitted wave that must decay for $z \\to \\infty$ (assuming $n_2>0$):\n$$ \\vec{E}(z>0, t) = \\hat{x} E_{0t} e^{i(k_m z - \\omega t)} $$\n$$ \\vec{B}(z>0, t) = \\hat{y} \\frac{k_m}{\\omega} E_{0t} e^{i(k_m z - \\omega t)} = \\hat{y} \\frac{n(\\omega)}{c} E_{0t} e^{i(k_m z - \\omega t)} $$\n\nAt the interface $z=0$, the tangential components of the electric field $\\vec{E}$ and the magnetic field $\\vec{H} = \\vec{B}/\\mu_0$ must be continuous.\nContinuity of $E_x$:\n$$ E_{0i} + E_{0r} = E_{0t} \\quad (1) $$\nContinuity of $H_y$ (since $\\mu=1$ in both media, continuity of $B_y/\\mu_0$ is equivalent to continuity of $B_y$):\n$$ \\frac{1}{c} (E_{0i} - E_{0r}) = \\frac{n(\\omega)}{c} E_{0t} \\implies E_{0i} - E_{0r} = n(\\omega) E_{0t} \\quad (2) $$\n\nWe solve for the complex amplitude reflection coefficient, $r \\equiv E_{0r}/E_{0i}$. From $(1)$, we have $E_{0t} = E_{0i}(1+r)$. Substituting this into $(2)$:\n$$ E_{0i}(1-r) = n(\\omega) E_{0i}(1+r) $$\n$$ 1-r = n(\\omega)(1+r) \\implies r(1+n(\\omega)) = 1-n(\\omega) $$\n$$ r = \\frac{1-n(\\omega)}{1+n(\\omega)} $$\nThe reflectance $R$ is the ratio of reflected to incident power, which is proportional to the modulus squared of the amplitude ratio:\n$$ R(\\omega) = |r(\\omega)|^2 = \\left|\\frac{1-n(\\omega)}{1+n(\\omega)}\\right|^2 $$\nSubstituting $n(\\omega) = n_1(\\omega) + i n_2(\\omega)$:\n$$ R(\\omega) = \\frac{|1 - n_1 - i n_2|^2}{|1 + n_1 + i n_2|^2} = \\frac{(1-n_1)^2 + n_2^2}{(1+n_1)^2 + n_2^2} $$\nFor the reflectance to be near unity, $R(\\omega) \\approx 1$, the numerator must be very close to the denominator.

Thus, near-total reflection occurs when the real part of the refractive index is close to zero: $n_1(\\omega) \\approx 0$.\n\nNow, we relate this condition to the dielectric function $\\epsilon(\\omega) = \\epsilon_1(\\omega) + i \\epsilon_2(\\omega)$. The relation $n(\\omega)^2 = \\epsilon(\\omega)$ gives:\n$$ (n_1 + i n_2)^2 = n_1^2 - n_2^2 + 2i n_1 n_2 = \\epsilon_1 + i \\epsilon_2 $$\nEquating the real and imaginary parts:\n$$ \\epsilon_1 = n_1^2 - n_2^2 $$\n$$ \\epsilon_2 = 2 n_1 n_2 $$\nIf $n_1(\\omega) \\approx 0$, then from the second equation, $\\epsilon_2(\\omega) \\approx 0$ (assuming $n_2$ is finite). The first equation then gives $\\epsilon_1(\\omega) \\approx -n_2^2$. Since $n_2$ is a real number, $n_2^2 \\ge 0$. For a non-trivial case where there is a field in the medium (i.e., $n_2 \\neq 0$), we must have $\\epsilon_1(\\omega) < 0$. In real materials, dissipation is small but non-zero, so $\\epsilon_2$ is a small positive quantity. For $n_1 \\approx 0$, we need $\\epsilon_1 < 0$ and $|\\epsilon_1| \\gg \\epsilon_2$. The fundamental condition for high reflectance is therefore a negative real part of the dielectric function, $\\epsilon_1(\\omega) < 0$.\n\nThe physical connection to an evanescent field comes from examining the transmitted wave's spatial dependence, $e^{i k_m z}$.\n$$ e^{i k_m z} = e^{i (\\omega/c) n(\\omega) z} = e^{i (\\omega/c) (n_1 + i n_2) z} = e^{i (\\omega/c) n_1 z} e^{-(\\omega/c) n_2 z} $$\nThe term $e^{-(\\omega/c) n_2 z}$ represents an exponential decay of the wave amplitude as it penetrates the medium. The decay length (or skin depth) is $\\delta = c/(\\omega n_2)$. The term $e^{i (\\omega/c) n_1 z}$ represents wave propagation.\nAn evanescent wave is, by definition, a non-propagating field that decays exponentially from the interface. Mathematically, this corresponds to a wave vector that is purely or predominantly imaginary.\nThe real part of the wave vector in the medium is $\\text{Re}(k_m) = (\\omega/c)n_1$. The condition for high reflectance, $n_1 \\approx 0$, implies that $\\text{Re}(k_m) \\approx 0$.\nWhen $n_1 = 0$, the wave inside the medium has the form:\n$$ \\vec{E}(z>0, t) = \\hat{x} E_{0t} e^{-(\\omega n_2/c) z} e^{-i\\omega t} $$\nThis describes a field that oscillates in time at every point but does not propagate in space; its amplitude decays exponentially with distance $z$ from the interface. This is precisely an evanescent wave. The incident energy cannot propagate into the medium and is almost entirely reflected, with a small amount of energy stored in the evanescent field near the surface before being re-radiated.\n\n**Task 2: Reflectance Spectrum for the Lorentz Model**\n\nThe normal-incidence reflectance is given by:\n$$ R(\\omega) = \\left|\\frac{1-\\sqrt{\\epsilon(\\omega)}}{1+\\sqrt{\\epsilon(\\omega)}}\\right|^2 $$\nThe problem provides the Lorentz model for the dielectric function:\n$$ \\epsilon(\\omega) = \\epsilon_{\\infty}\\left[ 1 + \\frac{\\omega_{L}^{2}-\\omega_{T}^{2}}{\\omega_{T}^{2}-\\omega^{2}-i\\gamma\\omega} \\right] $$\nThis expression can be simplified by combining the terms over a common denominator:\n$$ \\epsilon(\\omega) = \\epsilon_{\\infty} \\left[ \\frac{(\\omega_{T}^{2}-\\omega^{2}-i\\gamma\\omega) + (\\omega_{L}^{2}-\\omega_{T}^{2})}{\\omega_{T}^{2}-\\omega^{2}-i\\gamma\\omega} \\right] $$\n$$ \\epsilon(\\omega) = \\epsilon_{\\infty} \\frac{\\omega_{L}^{2}-\\omega^{2}-i\\gamma\\omega}{\\omega_{T}^{2}-\\omega^{2}-i\\gamma\\omega} $$\nThis more compact form clearly shows that $\\epsilon(\\omega)$ has a zero near $\\omega = \\omega_L$ and a resonance (pole) near $\\omega = \\omega_T$.\nSubstituting this compact expression for $\\epsilon(\\omega)$ into the formula for the reflectance $R(\\omega)$ yields the final closed-form analytic expression:\n$$ R(\\omega) = \\left| \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{\\epsilon_{\\infty} \\frac{\\omega_{L}^{2}-\\omega^{2}-i\\gamma\\omega}{\\omega_{T}^{2}-\\omega^{2}-i\\gamma\\omega}}}{1 + \\sqrt{\\epsilon_{\\infty} \\frac{\\omega_{L}^{2}-\\omega^{2}-i\\gamma\\omega}{\\omega_{T}^{2}-\\omega^{2}-i\\gamma\\omega}}} \\right|^2 $$\nThis expression for $R(\\omega)$ is a function of the frequency $\\omega$ and the material parameters $\\epsilon_{\\infty}$, $\\omega_T$, $\\omega_L$, and $\\gamma$ as required.

A solution will be derived.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from first principles as requested.\n\n1.  **Electron Concentration and Fermi Level**: At zero temperature ($T=0$), all states in the conduction band with energy up to the Fermi energy, $E_F$, are filled. The Fermi energy is measured relative to the conduction band minimum, $E_{c0}$. The filled states occupy a sphere in $\\mathbf{k}$-space of radius $k_F$, the Fermi wavevector. The electron concentration $n$ is the total number of electrons per unit volume. This is found by integrating the density of states in $\\mathbf{k}$-space up to $k_F$ and multiplying by the total degeneracy $g_s g_v$.\n\nThe volume of a single state in $\\mathbf{k}$-space for a crystal of volume $V$ is $\\frac{(2\\pi)^3}{V}$. The number of states within the Fermi sphere is its volume, $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi k_F^3$, divided by the volume per state.\n$$ n = \\frac{N}{V} = (g_s g_v) \\frac{1}{V} \\frac{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi k_F^3}{\\frac{(2\\pi)^3}{V}} = g_s g_v \\frac{k_F^3}{6\\pi^2} $$\nFrom this, we can express the Fermi wavevector $k_F$ and its square $k_F^2$ in terms of the electron concentration $n$:\n$$ k_F^3 = \\frac{6\\pi^2 n}{g_s g_v} \\implies k_F^2 = \\left(\\frac{6\\pi^2 n}{g_s g_v}\\right)^{2/3} $$\n\n2.  **Fermi Energy in the Non-parabolic Conduction Band**: The relationship between the electron kinetic energy $E$ and its wavevector $k$ in the conduction band is given by the Kane-type non-parabolic dispersion relation:\n$$ E(1 + \\alpha E) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2 m_c^*} $$\nFor electrons at the Fermi level, $E = E_F$ and $k=k_F$.\n$$ E_F(1 + \\alpha E_F) = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k_F^2}{2 m_c^*} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $k_F^2$ gives a quadratic equation for $E_F$:\n$$ \\alpha E_F^2 + E_F - \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m_c^*} \\left(\\frac{6\\pi^2 n}{g_s g_v}\\right)^{2/3} = 0 $$\nSolving this quadratic equation for $E_F$ (and taking the physically meaningful positive root for energy) yields:\n$$ E_F = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{1 - 4\\alpha \\left(-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m_c^*} \\left(\\frac{6\\pi^2 n}{g_s g_v}\\right)^{2/3}\\right)}}{2\\alpha} $$\n$$ E_F = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{2\\alpha\\hbar^2}{m_c^*} \\left(\\frac{6\\pi^2 n}{g_s g_v}\\right)^{2/3}}}{2\\alpha} $$\n\n3.  **Minimum Absorption Energy and the Absorption-Edge Shift**: Due to Pauli blocking, the final state of an absorbed photon's electron-hole pair creation must be an unoccupied state in the conduction band. At $T=0$, this means the final state energy must be greater than or equal to $E_{c0} + E_F$. The minimum energy transition occurs for the state at the Fermi edge, i.e., a final state with wavevector $k_F$ and energy $E_c(k_F) = E_{c0} + E_F$.\n\nFor a direct transition, the initial state in the valence band must have the same wavevector, $k_F$. Its energy is given by the valence band dispersion:\n$$ E_v(k_F) = E_{v0} - \\frac{\\hbar^2 k_F^2}{2 m_v^*} $$\nThe minimum photon energy required for absorption, $\\hbar\\omega_{min}$, is the difference between the final and initial state energies:\n$$ \\hbar\\omega_{min} = E_c(k_F) - E_v(k_F) = (E_{c0} + E_F) - \\left(E_{v0} - \\frac{\\hbar^2 k_F^2}{2 m_v^*}\\right) $$\n$$ \\hbar\\omega_{min} = (E_{c0} - E_{v0}) + E_F + \\frac{\\hbar^2 k_F^2}{2 m_v^*} $$\nThe undoped bandgap is $E_g = E_{c0} - E_{v0}$. The absorption-edge shift, $\\Delta E(n)$, is defined as the increase in minimum absorption energy relative to $E_g$:\n$$ \\Delta E(n) = \\hbar\\omega_{min} - E_g = E_F + \\frac{\\hbar^2 k_F^2}{2 m_v^*} $$\n\n4.  **Final Expression**: To obtain the final closed-form expression, we substitute the previously derived expressions for $E_F$ and $k_F^2$ into the equation for $\\Delta E(n)$:\n$$ \\Delta E(n) = \\frac{\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{2\\alpha\\hbar^2}{m_c^*} \\left(\\frac{6\\pi^2 n}{g_s g_v}\\right)^{2/3}} - 1}{2\\alpha} + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m_v^*} \\left(\\frac{6\\pi^2 n}{g_s g_v}\\right)^{2/3} $$\nThis expression gives the absorption-edge shift as a function of the required parameters.\n\nIn the limit of a parabolic conduction band ($\\alpha \\to 0$), we use the Taylor expansion $\\sqrt{1+x} \\approx 1 + x/2$ for small $x$. The first term becomes:\n$$ \\lim_{\\alpha \\to 0} \\frac{\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{2\\alpha\\hbar^2}{m_c^*} \\left(\\frac{6\\pi^2 n}{g_s g_v}\\right)^{2/3}\\right) - 1}{2\\alpha} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m_c^*} \\left(\\frac{6\\pi^2 n}{g_s g_v}\\right)^{2/3} $$\nThis is the Fermi energy for a parabolic band. The total shift reduces to:\n$$ \\Delta E(n)|_{\\alpha=0} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m_c^*} \\left(\\frac{6\\pi^2 n}{g_s g_v}\\right)^{2/3} + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2 m_v^*} \\left(\\frac{6\\pi^2 n}{g_s g_v}\\right)^{2/3} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{m_c^*} + \\frac{1}{m_v^*}\\right) \\left(\\frac{6\\pi^2 n}{g_s g_v}\\right)^{2/3} $$\nThis matches the well-known result for parabolic bands, confirming the correctness of the derived general expression.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\frac{\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{2\\alpha\\hbar^2}{m_c^*} \\left(\\frac{6\\pi^2 n}{g_s g_v}\\right)^{2/3}} - 1}{2\\alpha} + \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m_v^*} \\left(\\frac{6\\pi^2 n}{g_s g_v}\\right)^{2/3} } $$", "id": "3008314"}]}
