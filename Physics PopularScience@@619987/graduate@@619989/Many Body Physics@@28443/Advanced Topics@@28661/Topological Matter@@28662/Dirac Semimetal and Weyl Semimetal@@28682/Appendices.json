Each of these levels is doubly degenerate, corresponding to the states $|n=N, \\uparrow\\rangle$ and $|n=N-1, \\downarrow\\rangle$.\n\nThe $N=0$ Landau level is special. It exists only for the spin-up case with $n=0$:\n$$\nE_{0, \\uparrow}^2 = v^2 \\left( 2(0)\\hbar e B + (\\hbar k_z)^2 \\right) = (v\\hbar k_z)^2\n$$\nThere is no corresponding $N=0$ level for the spin-down states, as the lowest level for that series is for $n=0$, which gives index $N=n+1=1$. Thus, the $N=0$ Landau level is non-degenerate in this basis.\n\nTo find the correct energy $E_0(k_z)$, not just $E_0^2$, and to understand the spinor structure, we must act with the original Hamiltonian $H_{\\chi}$ on the corresponding eigenstate, which we determined must be of the form $|n=0, \\uparrow\\rangle$.\n$$\nH_{\\chi} |0, \\uparrow\\rangle = \\chi v \\left( (\\sigma_x \\Pi_x + \\sigma_y \\Pi_y) + \\sigma_z p_z \\right) |0, \\uparrow\\rangle\n$$\nThe planar kinetic term can be written in terms of spin ladder operators $\\sigma_\\pm = \\frac{1}{2}(\\sigma_x \\pm i\\sigma_y)$ and the bosonic ladder operators $a, a^\\dagger$:\n$$\n\\sigma_x \\Pi_x + \\sigma_y \\Pi_y = \\frac{\\hbar\\sqrt{2}}{l_B}(\\sigma_- a + \\sigma_+ a^\\dagger)\n$$\nLet's apply this term to $|0, \\uparrow\\rangle$:\n$$\n(\\sigma_- a + \\sigma_+ a^\\dagger)|0, \\uparrow\\rangle = (\\sigma_- a)|0, \\uparrow\\rangle + (\\sigma_+ a^\\dagger)|0, \\uparrow\\rangle = \\sigma_-|\\uparrow\\rangle \\otimes a|0\\rangle + \\sigma_+|\\uparrow\\rangle \\otimes a^\\dagger|0\\rangle\n$$\nSince $a|0\\rangle=0$ and $\\sigma_+|\\uparrow\\rangle=0$, both terms are zero. This means the kinetic energy in the $x-y$ plane for this specific state is zero.

This means the group velocity, $v_z = \\frac{1}{\\hbar}\\frac{\\partial E_0}{\\partial k_z} = \\chi v$, is constant and unidirectional. For a $\\chi=+1$ node, particles can only propagate along $+\\hat{z}$; for a $\\chi=-1$ node, they only propagate along $-\\hat{z}$. This is a hallmark of a chiral mode.\nSpinor Support: The eigenstate is $|0,\\uparrow\\rangle$. This state is composed of the lowest orbital LL state ($n=0$) and is fully spin-polarized with spin pointing along the direction of the magnetic field ($\\mathbf{B}$).\n\nThe $n=0$ LL is of fixed chirality (more precisely, fixed spin polarization) because it is an exact eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, unlike the higher levels. The higher levels ($N \\geq 1$) are constructed from a superposition of spin-up and spin-down states (specifically, $|N, \\uparrow\\rangle$ and $|N-1, \\downarrow\\rangle$), and their spinors are not fixed but depend on $k_z$. The unique nature of the $n=0$ LL arises from the simultaneous annihilation of the state $|0, \\uparrow\\rangle$ by both the orbital lowering operator $a$ and the spin-raising component of the kinetic term $\\sigma_+$, which leaves only the simple $p_z \\sigma_z$ term. This lock between spin and orbital state is a direct consequence of the relativistic structure of the Weyl Hamiltonian.\n\nThe full Landau level spectrum is therefore:\n$$\nE_0(k_z) = \\chi v \\hbar k_z \\quad (\\text{for } n=0)\n$$\n$$\nE_n(k_z) = \\pm v \\sqrt{2n\\hbar e B + (\\hbar k_z)^2} \\quad (\\text{for } n \\ge 1, \\text{doubly degenerate})\n$$\nThe problem specifies to report only the expression for $E_0(k_z)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\chi v \\hbar k_z}\n$$", "id": "2870321"}, {"introduction": "One of the most striking experimental signatures of a Weyl semimetal is its unusual transport response to parallel electric and magnetic fields, a direct consequence of the chiral anomaly.
