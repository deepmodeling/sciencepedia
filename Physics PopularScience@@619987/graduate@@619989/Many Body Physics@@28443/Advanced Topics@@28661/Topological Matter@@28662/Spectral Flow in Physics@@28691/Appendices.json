At the center of the sphere is a static magnetic monopole. The interaction of the particle with the monopole's magnetic field is characterized by a dimensionless strength parameter $s$. According to Dirac's quantization condition, this parameter must be a half-integer, i.e., $s = n/2$ for some integer $n$, which is called the monopole number.\n\nThe energy eigenvalues of the particle are given by the formula:\n$$E_j(s) = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2mR^2} \\left[ j(j+1) - s^2 \\right]$$\nwhere $j$ is the total angular momentum quantum number.

This problem investigates a Dirac fermion in 2+1 dimensions encountering a domain wall, where a mass term changes its sign. This mass profile represents a topological defect, and the exercise is to show that it binds a chiral, massless state that propagates along the wall [@problem_id:1198464]. By treating the momentum parallel to the wall, $k_y$, as an adiabatic parameter, you will witness the \"flow\" of an energy eigenvalue across zero, providing a beautiful and explicit visualization of the spectral flow mechanism that guarantees the existence of these topologically protected modes.", "problem": "Consider a 2+1 dimensional system of Dirac fermions described by the Hamiltonian:\n$$H = v_F (\\sigma_x p_x + \\sigma_z p_y) + m(x) \\sigma_y$$\nwhere $p_x = -i\\hbar\\partial_x$ and $p_y = -i\\hbar\\partial_y$ are momentum operators, $\\sigma_i$ are the Pauli matrices, and $v_F$ is the Fermi velocity. For simplicity, we set $\\hbar=v_F=1$.\n\nThe mass term $m(x)$ is not constant but forms a domain wall profile along the $x$-direction, given by:\n$$m(x) = m_0 \\tanh(x/L)$$\nwhere $m_0 > 0$ is the bulk mass magnitude and $L > 0$ is the characteristic width of the wall. This mass profile creates a topological defect, as the mass changes sign from $-m_0$ at $x \\to -\\infty$ to $+m_0$ at $x \\to +\\infty$.\n\nSuch a domain wall can trap chiral fermion modes, which are localized at the wall (in the $x$-direction) and propagate freely along it (in the $y$-direction). The number of these modes is a topological invariant.\n\nThe problem can be reduced to an effective 1D problem by considering states with a definite momentum $k_y$ along the wall. The number of bound chiral modes is equal to the absolute value of the spectral flow of the resulting 1D Hamiltonian family $H_{1D}(k_y)$ as $k_y$ is swept from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$. The spectral flow is defined as the net number of energy eigenvalues that cross zero from negative to positive.\n\nCalculate the number of chiral fermion modes bound to the domain wall.", "solution": "The 2+1D Hamiltonian is given by $H = \\sigma_x(-i\\partial_x) + \\sigma_z(-i\\partial_y) + m(x)\\sigma_y$. The system is translationally invariant along the $y$-direction, so we can Fourier transform with respect to $y$. We replace the operator $-i\\partial_y$ with its eigenvalue $k_y$, the momentum along the domain wall. This yields a family of 1D Hamiltonians parameterized by $k_y$:\n$$H_{1D}(k_y) = -i\\sigma_x\\partial_x + k_y\\sigma_z + m(x)\\sigma_y$$\nThis operator acts on two-component spinor wavefunctions $\\psi(x)$. In the standard basis where $\\sigma_z$ is diagonal, the Hamiltonian is:\n$$H_{1D}(k_y) = \\begin{pmatrix} k_y & -i\\partial_x - im(x) \\\\ -i\\partial_x + im(x) & -k_y \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe number of chiral modes is given by the absolute value of the spectral flow of $H_{1D}(k_y)$ as $k_y$ varies from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$. The spectral flow counts the net number of eigenvalues crossing $E=0$ from below.\n\nA powerful method to compute the spectral flow for this type of Hamiltonian family, $H(k_y) = D + k_y \\Gamma$, is via an index theorem, provided that the operator $D=H_{1D}(0)$ anti-commutes with the grading operator $\\Gamma=\\sigma_z$. Let's verify this condition:\n$$D = -i\\sigma_x\\partial_x + m(x)\\sigma_y$$\n$$\\Gamma = \\sigma_z$$\n$$D\\Gamma = (-i\\sigma_x\\partial_x + m(x)\\sigma_y)\\sigma_z = -i\\sigma_x\\sigma_z\\partial_x + m(x)\\sigma_y\\sigma_z = -i(i\\sigma_y)\\partial_x + m(x)(i\\sigma_x) = \\sigma_y\\partial_x + im(x)\\sigma_x$$\n$$\\Gamma D = \\sigma_z(-i\\sigma_x\\partial_x + m(x)\\sigma_y) = -i\\sigma_z\\sigma_x\\partial_x + m(x)\\sigma_z\\sigma_y = -i(-i\\sigma_y)\\partial_x + m(x)(-i\\sigma_x) = -\\sigma_y\\partial_x - im(x)\\sigma_x$$\nIndeed, we find that $D\\Gamma = - \\Gamma D$.\n\nThe spectral flow of the family $H_{1D}(k_y)$ is related to the Fredholm index of the operator $D$. A zero-energy eigenstate (a zero mode) of $H_{1D}(k_y)$ corresponds to an eigenvalue crossing $E=0$ at that specific value of $k_y$. Let's find the values of $k_y$ for which zero modes exist. The condition is $H_{1D}(k_y)\\psi = 0$.\n$$k_y u -i(\\partial_x+m)v = 0$$\n$$-i(\\partial_x-m)u - k_y v = 0$$\nIf $k_y \\neq 0$, we can solve for $v$ from the second equation: $v = -\\frac{i}{k_y}(\\partial_x-m)u$. Substituting into the first gives:\n$$k_y u - \\frac{1}{k_y}(\\partial_x+m)(\\partial_x-m)u = 0$$\n$$k_y^2 u = (\\partial_x+m)(\\partial_x-m)u = (\\partial_x^2 - m(x)^2 - m'(x))u$$\nThis is an effective Schrödinger equation $(-\\partial_x^2 + m(x)^2 + m'(x))u = -k_y^2 u$. A zero mode of $H_{1D}(k_y)$ for $k_y \\neq 0$ requires a solution $u(x)$ to this equation that is also part of a valid spinor solution which satisfies the original first-order equations. If we substitute $u$ back, we also need $(\\partial_x - m)u \\neq 0$ (since $v$ must be non-zero for a non-trivial solution if $u$ is non-zero). However, if we have a solution to the second-order equation, it must also satisfy the original coupled first-order equations. It turns out that any normalizable solution to the squared problem does not satisfy the original first order problem unless $k_y=0$.\n\nLet's focus on the case $k_y=0$, which corresponds to finding the kernel of $D=H_{1D}(0)$. The equations become:\n$$(\\partial_x+m(x))v = 0$$\n$$(\\partial_x-m(x))u = 0$$\nThe solutions are $v(x) = C_1 \\exp(-\\int_0^x m(x')dx')$ and $u(x) = C_2 \\exp(\\int_0^x m(x')dx')$.\nThe mass profile is $m(x) = m_0 \\tanh(x/L)$. The integral is:\n$$\\int_0^x m(x')dx' = m_0 \\int_0^x \\tanh(x'/L)dx' = m_0 L \\ln(\\cosh(x/L))$$\nSo the solutions are:\n$$u(x) = C_2 [\\cosh(x/L)]^{m_0 L}$$\n$$v(x) = C_1 [\\cosh(x/L)]^{-m_0 L}$$\nFor a state to be physically acceptable (bound to the domain wall), its wavefunction must be normalizable, i.e., $\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty |\\psi(x)|^2 dx < \\infty$.\nAs $|x| \\to \\infty$, $\\cosh(x/L) \\sim e^{|x|/L}$.\nThe solution $u(x)$ behaves as $e^{m_0|x|}$, which diverges. Thus, we must have $C_2=0$.\nThe solution $v(x)$ behaves as $e^{-m_0|x|}$, which decays exponentially and is normalizable. Thus, we can have $C_1 \\neq 0$.\n\nThis means that for $k_y=0$, there is exactly one zero mode, given by:\n$$\\psi_0(x) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ v(x) \\end{pmatrix} = C_1 \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ (\\cosh(x/L))^{-m_0 L} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThis single zero mode at $k_y=0$ implies there is exactly one energy level that crosses $E=0$. To find the spectral flow, we need to determine the direction of this crossing. The slope of the energy band at the crossing point is given by first-order perturbation theory:\n$$E(k_y) \\approx k_y \\frac{\\langle \\psi_0 | \\sigma_z | \\psi_0 \\rangle}{\\langle \\psi_0 | \\psi_0 \\rangle}$$\nLet's compute the numerator:\n$$\\langle \\psi_0 | \\sigma_z | \\psi_0 \\rangle = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\psi_0^\\dagger(x) \\sigma_z \\psi_0(x) dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty |C_1|^2 (0, [\\cosh(x/L)]^{-m_0 L}) \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ [\\cosh(x/L)]^{-m_0 L} \\end{pmatrix} dx$$\n$$\\langle \\psi_0 | \\sigma_z | \\psi_0 \\rangle = -|C_1|^2 \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty [\\cosh(x/L)]^{-2m_0 L} dx$$\nSince $m_0>0$ and $L>0$, the integrand is positive, so the integral is positive. Therefore, $\\langle \\psi_0 | \\sigma_z | \\psi_0 \\rangle < 0$. This means the slope $dE/dk_y$ at $k_y=0$ is negative. The energy level crosses $E=0$ from positive to negative values as $k_y$ increases.\n\nThe spectral flow is the net number of upward crossings. Since there is only one crossing and it is downward, the spectral flow is -1.\n$$\\text{Spectral Flow} = -1$$\nThe problem asks for the number of chiral fermion modes, which corresponds to the number of energy bands crossing the Fermi level ($E=0$). This is given by the absolute value of the spectral flow.\n$$\\text{Number of modes} = |\\text{Spectral Flow}| = |-1| = 1$$\nThere is exactly one chiral fermion mode bound to the domain wall. The sign of the flow indicates the chirality of the mode (i.e., its direction of propagation).
