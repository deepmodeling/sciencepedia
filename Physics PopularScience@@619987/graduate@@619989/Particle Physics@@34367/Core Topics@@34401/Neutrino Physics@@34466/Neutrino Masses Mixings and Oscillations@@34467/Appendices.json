In the basis where the charged lepton mass matrix is diagonal, the neutrino masses can be described by a $3 \\times 3$ complex symmetric Majorana mass matrix, $m_\\nu$. This matrix is diagonalized by the PMNS matrix as follows:\n$$\nU^T m_\\nu U = \\text{diag}(m_1, m_2, m_3)\n$$\nwhere $m_i$ are the physical masses of the neutrinos. This implies that the columns of the PMNS matrix, $u_i$, are the eigenvectors of $m_\\nu$ in the flavor basis.\n\nConsider a theoretical model where the neutrino mass matrix exhibits a \"texture zero\" in the $(e,e)$ element, i.e., $m_{ee} = 0$. The elements of the mass matrix are denoted by $m_{\\alpha\\beta}$ with $\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\{e, \\mu, \\tau\\}$.
