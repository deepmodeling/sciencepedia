            "problem": "A spherical target body of mass $M$ and radius $R$ resides on a near-circular heliocentric orbit. A population of small projectiles approaches the target from heliocentric free space with a uniform asymptotic speed $v_{\\infty}$ relative to the target and isotropic incidence directions. Treat each encounter as a two-body, non-relativistic, point-mass interaction between the projectile and the target, neglecting the influence of the central star, atmospheric drag, planetary oblateness, and any dissipative forces. Using Newtonian gravity, conservation of energy, and conservation of angular momentum, derive the maximum impact parameter $b_{\\max}$ for which a projectile will collide with the target (i.e., reach pericenter $r_{\\text{p}} \\leq R$). From this, show that the collision cross-section can be written in the form $\\sigma = \\pi R^{2}(1 + \\Theta)$ and obtain an explicit analytic expression for the gravitational focusing factor $\\Theta$ in terms of $G$, $M$, $R$, and $v_{\\infty}$. Then, justify the domain of validity and the limitations of this focusing enhancement for high-speed impacts by quantifying the small-deflection regime using the leading-order dependence on $v_{\\infty}$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a standard two-body gravitational scattering problem, a cornerstone of celestial mechanics. All necessary parameters and simplifying assumptions are explicitly provided, leading to a unique and meaningful solution. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds by applying the principles of conservation of energy and conservation of angular momentum to the two-body system consisting of the target body (mass $M$) and a projectile (mass $m$). We are given that the projectile approaches the target from a large distance with a relative speed $v_{\\infty}$ and an impact parameter $b$. The gravitational interaction is governed by Newton's law of universal gravitation.\n\nFirst, we apply the principle of conservation of energy. The total energy $E$ of the projectile is constant throughout its trajectory. At an infinite distance from the target ($r \\to \\infty$), the gravitational potential energy is zero, so the total energy is purely kinetic:\n$$E = \\frac{1}{2} m v_{\\infty}^2$$\nAt any other point in the trajectory, at a distance $r$ from the center of the target where the projectile's speed is $v$, the total energy is the sum of its kinetic and potential energies:\n$$E = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 - \\frac{GMm}{r}$$\nEquating these two expressions for the conserved total energy, we have:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} m v_{\\infty}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 - \\frac{GMm}{r}$$\nDividing by the projectile's mass $m$, we obtain the specific energy equation:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} v_{\\infty}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} v^2 - \\frac{GM}{r}$$\n\nNext, we apply the principle of conservation of angular momentum. The specific angular momentum $L$ of the projectile with respect to the target is also constant. At an infinite distance, the angular momentum is defined by the impact parameter $b$ and the approach speed $v_{\\infty}$:\n$$L = b v_{\\infty}$$\nThe point of closest approach is the pericenter, with distance $r_{\\text{p}}$. At this point, the projectile's velocity vector $\\vec{v}_{\\text{p}}$ is perpendicular to its position vector $\\vec{r}_{\\text{p}}$. The specific angular momentum at pericenter is therefore:\n$$L = r_{\\text{p}} v_{\\text{p}}$$\nEquating these two expressions for the conserved specific angular momentum, we get:\n$$b v_{\\infty} = r_{\\text{p}} v_{\\text{p}}$$\n\nWe can now find a relationship between the impact parameter $b$ and the pericenter distance $r_{\\text{p}}$. From the angular momentum conservation equation, we express the speed at pericenter as $v_{\\text{p}} = \\frac{b v_{\\infty}}{r_{\\text{p}}}$. We substitute this into the energy conservation equation evaluated at the pericenter ($r=r_{\\text{p}}$, $v=v_{\\text{p}}$):\n$$\\frac{1}{2} v_{\\infty}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} v_{\\text{p}}^2 - \\frac{GM}{r_{\\text{p}}}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{2} v_{\\infty}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{b v_{\\infty}}{r_{\\text{p}}}\\right)^2 - \\frac{GM}{r_{\\text{p}}}$$\nTo solve for the impact parameter $b$, we multiply by $2$ and rearrange the equation:\n$$v_{\\infty}^2 = \\frac{b^2 v_{\\infty}^2}{r_{\\text{p}}^2} - \\frac{2GM}{r_{\\text{p}}}$$\n$$v_{\\infty}^2 + \\frac{2GM}{r_{\\text{p}}} = \\frac{b^2 v_{\\infty}^2}{r_{\\text{p}}^2}$$\nMultiplying by $\\frac{r_{\\text{p}}^2}{v_{\\infty}^2}$ isolates $b^2$:\n$$b^2 = r_{\\text{p}}^2 \\left(1 + \\frac{2GM}{r_{\\text{p}} v_{\\infty}^2}\\right)$$\nThis equation relates the impact parameter $b$ to the resulting distance of closest approach $r_{\\text{p}}$.\n\nA collision occurs if the projectile's trajectory intersects the target body, meaning the pericenter distance is less than or equal to the target's radius, $r_{\\text{p}} \\le R$. The maximum impact parameter for a collision, $b_{\\max}$, corresponds to the grazing trajectory where the projectile just touches the surface of the target, i.e., $r_{\\text{p}} = R$. Setting $r_{\\text{p}} = R$ in the equation for $b^2$:\n$$b_{\\max}^2 = R^2 \\left(1 + \\frac{2GM}{R v_{\\infty}^2}\\right)$$\n\nThe collision cross-section, $\\sigma$, is the effective area presented to the incoming uniform flux of projectiles. All projectiles with an impact parameter $b \\le b_{\\max}$ will collide with the target. This corresponds to a circular area of radius $b_{\\max}$ perpendicular to the initial velocity vector. Thus, the cross-section is:\n$$\\sigma = \\pi b_{\\max}^2$$\nSubstituting our expression for $b_{\\max}^2$:\n$$\\sigma = \\pi R^2 \\left(1 + \\frac{2GM}{R v_{\\infty}^2}\\right)$$\n\nThe problem states that the cross-section can be written in the form $\\sigma = \\pi R^2(1 + \\Theta)$, where $\\pi R^2$ is the geometric cross-section and $\\Theta$ is the gravitational focusing factor. By comparing our derived expression for $\\sigma$ with this form, we can identify $\\Theta$:\n$$\\pi R^2(1 + \\Theta) = \\pi R^2 \\left(1 + \\frac{2GM}{R v_{\\infty}^2}\\right)$$\n$$1 + \\Theta = 1 + \\frac{2GM}{R v_{\\infty}^2}$$\nThis yields the explicit analytic expression for the gravitational focusing factor:\n$$\\Theta = \\frac{2GM}{R v_{\\infty}^2}$$\nThis factor is dimensionless. It can be physically interpreted as the ratio of the square of the target's surface escape velocity, $v_{\\text{esc}}^2 = \\frac{2GM}{R}$, to the square of the projectile's asymptotic approach speed, $v_{\\infty}^2$. Thus, $\\Theta = \\left(\\frac{v_{\\text{esc}}}{v_{\\infty}}\\right)^2$.\n\nFinally, we analyze the domain of validity and the high-speed impact limit. The enhancement of the cross-section due to gravity is significant when $\\Theta \\gtrsim 1$, which occurs when $v_{\\infty} \\lesssim v_{\\text{esc}}$. The derived model is valid under the assumptions of a two-body, non-relativistic interaction without non-gravitational forces.\n\nFor high-speed impacts, $v_{\\infty}$ becomes very large. The \"small-deflection regime\" corresponds to the limit where $v_{\\infty} \\gg v_{\\text{esc}}$. In this regime, the focusing factor $\\Theta = \\frac{2GM}{R v_{\\infty}^2}$ becomes much less than $1$. The leading-order dependence on the approach speed is $\\Theta \\propto v_{\\infty}^{-2}$. As $v_{\\infty} \\to \\infty$, $\\Theta \\to 0$. The collision cross-section then approaches its geometric limit:\n$$\\lim_{v_{\\infty} \\to \\infty} \\sigma = \\lim_{v_{\\infty} \\to \\infty} \\left[ \\pi R^2(1 + \\Theta) \\right] = \\pi R^2$$\nThis result quantifies the limitation of the focusing enhancement: for sufficiently fast projectiles, gravity has a negligible effect on their trajectories, and the target's effective size is simply its physical size. The small-deflection regime is defined by $v_{\\infty} \\gg \\sqrt{2GM/R}$, where the gravitational bending is a small perturbation to the projectile's path.\n\nThe required final answer is the explicit expression for $\\Theta$.",

The premises are internally consistent.\n5.  **Realism and Feasibility:** The heliocentric approximation ($m_i \\ll M_{\\odot}$) is physically realistic for systems like our own Solar System and is a standard simplification in celestial mechanics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, complete, and feasible. I will now proceed with the derivation and explanation.\n\n***\n\nThe solution is derived from the fundamental definitions provided.\n\nFirst, we express the z-component of the angular momentum for a single planet, $L_{i,z}$, by substituting the given definitions.\nThe magnitude of the angular momentum is $|\\mathbf{L}_i| = m_i h_i$. The specific angular momentum is $h_i = \\sqrt{\\mu_i a_i (1-e_i^2)}$, where $\\mu_i = G(M_{\\odot}+m_i)$.\nCombining these, we have:\n$$|\\mathbf{L}_i| = m_i \\sqrt{G(M_{\\odot}+m_i) a_i (1-e_i^2)}$$\nThe component of this angular momentum along the reference axis (perpendicular to the invariable plane) is given by $L_{i,z} = |\\mathbf{L}_i| \\cos i_i$.\n$$L_{i,z} = m_i \\sqrt{G(M_{\\odot}+m_i) a_i (1-e_i^2)} \\cos i_i$$\nThe total z-component of angular momentum for the actual system is the sum over all $N$ planets:\n$$L_{z, \\text{actual}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} L_{i,z} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \\sqrt{G(M_{\\odot}+m_i) a_i (1-e_i^2)} \\cos i_i$$\nNext, we determine the total z-component of angular momentum for the circular, coplanar reference configuration. In this configuration, the orbital elements are $e_i=0$ and $i_i=0$ for all planets, while $a_i$ and $m_i$ remain unchanged.\nSubstituting $e_i=0$ and $i_i=0$ into the expression for $L_{i,z}$, we find the z-component for a planet in the reference configuration:\n$$L_{i,z, \\text{ref}} = m_i \\sqrt{G(M_{\\odot}+m_i) a_i (1-0^2)} \\cos(0)$$\nSince $\\cos(0)=1$ and $\\sqrt{1-0^2}=1$, this simplifies to:\n$$L_{i,z, \\text{ref}} = m_i \\sqrt{G(M_{\\odot}+m_i) a_i}$$\nThe total z-component of angular momentum for the reference system is the sum over all planets:\n$$L_{z, \\text{ref}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} L_{i,z, \\text{ref}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \\sqrt{G(M_{\\odot}+m_i) a_i}$$\nThe Angular Momentum Deficit, which we will denote here as $AMD_{phys}$ to signify the physical quantity with units of angular momentum, is defined as the difference $L_{z, \\text{ref}} - L_{z, \\text{actual}}$:\n$$AMD_{phys} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \\sqrt{G(M_{\\odot}+m_i) a_i} - \\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \\sqrt{G(M_{\\odot}+m_i) a_i (1-e_i^2)} \\cos i_i$$\nFactoring out the common term for each planet within the summation:\n$$AMD_{phys} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \\sqrt{G(M_{\\odot}+m_i) a_i} \\left(1 - \\sqrt{1-e_i^2} \\cos i_i\\right)$$\nNow, we apply the heliocentric approximation, $m_i \\ll M_{\\odot}$. This implies that for each planet, $M_{\\odot} + m_i \\approx M_{\\odot}$. Substituting this into the expression for $AMD_{phys}$:\n$$AMD_{phys} \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \\sqrt{G M_{\\odot} a_i} \\left(1 - \\sqrt{1-e_i^2} \\cos i_i\\right)$$\nWe can factor out the constant term $\\sqrt{G M_{\\odot}}$ from the summation:\n$$AMD_{phys} \\approx \\sqrt{G M_{\\odot}} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \\sqrt{a_i} \\left(1 - \\sqrt{1-e_i^2} \\cos i_i\\right)$$\nThe problem defines the quantity \"AMD\" as the expression that remains after factoring out this common scale. Let us call this normalized quantity $AMD_{norm}$.\n$$AMD_{norm} = \\frac{AMD_{phys}}{\\sqrt{G M_{\\odot}}} \\approx \\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \\sqrt{a_i} \\left(1 - \\sqrt{1-e_i^2} \\cos i_i\\right)$$\nThis matches the target expression. For simplicity and following the problem's convention, we will simply refer to this normalized quantity as $AMD$.\n$$AMD = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \\sqrt{a_i} \\left(1 - \\sqrt{1-e_i^2} \\cos i_i\\right)$$\n\nNext, we address the invariance properties.\n\n**Invariance under uniform rescaling of $M_{\\odot}$:**\nThe problem asks why the derived expression for $AMD$ is invariant under a uniform rescaling of the central mass, $M_{\\odot} \\to \\lambda M_{\\odot}$, \"when expressed with the common factor $\\sqrt{G M_{\\odot}}$ absorbed into the unit system\".\nThe phrase \"absorbed into the unit system\" means we are considering the normalized quantity $AMD_{norm} = AMD_{phys} / \\sqrt{G M_{\\odot}}$. The derived expression for this quantity is:\n$$AMD = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \\sqrt{a_i} \\left(1 - \\sqrt{1-e_i^2} \\cos i_i\\right)$$\nThis expression depends on the planetary masses $m_i$ and their orbital geometry, specifically the semimajor axes $a_i$, eccentricities $e_i$, and inclinations $i_i$. The expression does not explicitly contain the stellar mass $M_{\\odot}$. Therefore, if we consider a scenario where $M_{\\odot}$ is rescaled but the orbital architecture ($a_i, e_i, i_i$ for all $i$) and planetary masses ($m_i$) are held constant, the numerical value of the AMD expression remains unchanged. This is the basis of its invariance. The physical angular momentum deficit, $AMD_{phys}$, would scale as $\\sqrt{\\lambda}$, but the normalized AMD, which is often used in practice (e.g., in unit systems where $G=M_{\\odot}=1$), is invariant under this specific change.\n\n**Invariance under uniform rescaling of planetary masses $m_i$:**\nWe investigate the behavior of the AMD under a uniform rescaling of all planetary masses, $m_i \\to \\kappa m_i$ for all $i$, where $\\kappa$ is a constant scaling factor. The orbital parameters ($a_i, e_i, i_i$) are assumed to remain constant.\nLet the new AMD be $AMD'$.\n$$AMD' = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (\\kappa m_i) \\sqrt{a_i} \\left(1 - \\sqrt{1-e_i^2} \\cos i_i\\right)$$\nFactoring out the constant $\\kappa$:\n$$AMD' = \\kappa \\sum_{i=1}^{N} m_i \\sqrt{a_i} \\left(1 - \\sqrt{1-e_i^2} \\cos i_i\\right) = \\kappa \\cdot AMD$$\nThe AMD is not invariant; it scales linearly with the mass scale factor $\\kappa$. To construct an invariant quantity, one must normalize the AMD by another quantity that also scales linearly with $\\kappa$. A natural and physically meaningful choice is the total mass of the planets in the system, $M_{p, \\text{tot}} = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} m_j$.\nUnder the mass rescaling, the new total planetary mass is $M'_{p, \\text{tot}} = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} (\\kappa m_j) = \\kappa \\sum_{j=1}^{N} m_j = \\kappa M_{p, \\text{tot}}$.\nTherefore, the ratio $\\frac{AMD}{M_{p, \\text{tot}}}$ is invariant under this transformation:\n$$\\frac{AMD'}{M'_{p, \\text{tot}}} = \\frac{\\kappa \\cdot AMD}{\\kappa \\cdot M_{p, \\text{tot}}} = \\frac{AMD}{M_{p, \\text{tot}}}$$\nThus, the AMD is invariant under uniform rescaling of all planetary masses if it is normalized by the total planetary mass. This normalized quantity represents a mass-weighted average of the orbital \"excitation\" in terms of eccentricity and inclination.",

It provides a clear, computationally tractable model of a recognized hypothesis in planetary science (the Grand Tack). All necessary physical constants, model parameters, and functional forms are provided, allowing for a unique solution to be computed for each test case. The simplifying assumptions, such as the approximation of the clearing path, are explicitly stated, ensuring the problem is self-contained and unambiguous. The problem does not violate any scientific principles, is free of subjectivity, and contains sufficient information for a formal solution.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A computational solution will be developed as specified.\n\n### Solution Development\n\nThe solution computes the remaining solid mass in three specified zones of the inner solar system after Jupiter's Grand Tack migration. The methodology involves defining a depleted surface density profile and integrating it over the specified radial zones.\n\n**1. Model Initialization: Constants and Parameters**\nThe physical constants are defined as provided:\n- Solar Mass: $M_{\\odot}=1.9885\\times 10^{30}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n- Jupiter Mass: $M_{J}=1.89813\\times 10^{27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n- Earth Mass: $M_{\\oplus}=5.9722\\times 10^{24}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n- Astronomical Unit: $\\mathrm{AU}=1.495978707\\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n\nFor each test case, the parameter tuple $(\\Sigma_{0},p,k,d_{\\mathrm{clear}},d_{\\mathrm{res}},w_{\\mathrm{res,fac}},a_{\\mathrm{start}},a_{\\mathrm{tack}},a_{\\mathrm{end}})$ is used to configure the model.\n\n**2. Unperturbed Surface Density and Mass**\nThe initial solid surface density is given by the power law:\n$$\n\\Sigma_{s}(a)=\\Sigma_{0}\\left(\\frac{a}{a_{0}}\\right)^{-p}\n$$\nwhere $a$ is the semi-major axis, $a_{0}=1\\,\\mathrm{AU}$, $\\Sigma_{0}$ is the surface density at $a_0$, and $p$ is the power-law index. The mass $dM$ in an infinitesimal annulus of radius $a$ and width $da$ is $dM = 2\\pi a \\, \\Sigma_s(a) \\, da$. The total mass in a zone from $a_1$ to $a_2$ is found by integrating this expression. For all calculations, distances must be converted from astronomical units ($\\mathrm{AU}$) to meters ($\\mathrm{m}$).\n\n**3. The Depletion Model**\nThe model applies two distinct depletion effects: a broad clearing along Jupiter's migration path and a localized clearing at a mean-motion resonance.\n\n**3.1. Path Clearing Zone**\nJupiter's gravitational influence clears a region around its orbit. The Hill radius is given by $R_{H}(a)=a\\left(\\frac{M_{J}}{3M_{\\odot}}\\right)^{1/3}$. The simplified total path clearing zone is the interval from the innermost edge of clearing at the tack point to the outermost edge at the final location:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{path}} = \\left[a_{\\mathrm{tack}}-k\\,R_{H}(a_{\\mathrm{tack}}),\\,a_{\\mathrm{end}}+k\\,R_{H}(a_{\\mathrm{end}})\\right]\n$$\nAny material a distance $a$ within this interval ($a \\in I_{\\mathrm{path}}$) undergoes depletion from two passes of Jupiter (inward and outward), so $N_{\\mathrm{pass}}(a)=2$. Otherwise, $N_{\\mathrm{pass}}(a)=0$.\n\n**3.2. Resonant Clearing Zone**\nAn additional depletion occurs at the interior $2{:}1$ mean-motion resonance with Jupiter at its tack location. The resonance is located at:\n$$\na_{2{:}1}=a_{\\mathrm{tack}}\\,2^{-2/3}\n$$\nThe clearing is applied over a band of total width $2w_{\\mathrm{res}}$ centered at $a_{2{:}1}$:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{res}} = [a_{2{:}1}-w_{\\mathrm{res}},\\,a_{2{:}1}+w_{\\mathrm{res}}]\n$$\nwhere the half-width $w_{\\mathrm{res}}$ is defined relative to the clearing width at the tack point: $w_{\\mathrm{res}}=w_{\\mathrm{res,fac}}\\times k \\times R_{H}(a_{\\mathrm{tack}})$. Material at a distance $a$ within this band ($a \\in I_{\\mathrm{res}}$) is subject to resonant depletion, which is modeled by setting the indicator function $\\mathbb{I}_{\\mathrm{res}}(a)=1$. Otherwise, $\\mathbb{I}_{\\mathrm{res}}(a)=0$.\n\n**4. Post-Tack Surface Density and Mass Integral**\nThe fractional depletion at a given radius $a$, $\\delta_{\\mathrm{tot}}(a)$, combines the path and resonant effects multiplicatively on the remaining fraction of material:\n$$\n\\delta_{\\mathrm{tot}}(a) = 1-\\left(1-d_{\\mathrm{clear}}\\right)^{N_{\\mathrm{pass}}(a)}\\left(1-d_{\\mathrm{res}}\\right)^{\\mathbb{I}_{\\mathrm{res}}(a)}\n$$\nThe post-tack surface density is then:\n$$\n\\Sigma_{\\mathrm{post}}(a) = \\Sigma_{s}(a) \\, (1 - \\delta_{\\mathrm{tot}}(a))\n$$\nThe total mass remaining in a zone $[a_1, a_2]$ is the integral of the post-tack density profile:\n$$\nM_{\\mathrm{zone}} = \\int_{a_1}^{a_2} 2\\pi a \\, \\Sigma_{\\mathrm{post}}(a) \\, da = \\int_{a_1}^{a_2} 2\\pi a \\, \\Sigma_{s}(a) \\, (1 - \\delta_{\\mathrm{tot}}(a)) \\, da\n$$\n\n**5. Numerical Integration**\nSince $\\delta_{\\mathrm{tot}}(a)$ is a piecewise-constant function, the integral could be solved analytically by splitting the integration domain for each zone. However, a more robust and direct approach is to use numerical quadrature. The implementation will use the `scipy.integrate.quad` function to compute the definite integral for each planetary zone. The integrand function `integrand(a)` will be defined to compute $2\\pi a \\, \\Sigma_{\\mathrm{post}}(a)$ at any given radius $a$ (in meters), correctly evaluating $\\delta_{\\mathrm{tot}}(a)$ based on the location of $a$ relative to the calculated depletion zones.\n\n**6. Final Output Generation**\nThe mass for each zone is calculated in kilograms. This value is then converted to Earth masses by dividing by $M_{\\oplus}$. Finally, the result is rounded to three significant figures as required. The results for the three zones (Mercury, Venus-Earth, Mars) for each test case are collected and formatted into the specified list-of-lists structure.",
