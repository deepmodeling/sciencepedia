This flux is the integral of the spectral flux, $F = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} F_{\\lambda} d\\lambda$. For a real object with wavelength-dependent emissivity $\\epsilon(\\lambda)$ and a surface/atmospheric temperature profile $T_{\\mathrm{phys}}$, the emitted spectral flux is $F_{\\lambda} = \\epsilon(\\lambda) \\pi B_{\\lambda}(T_{\\mathrm{phys}})$. In a planetary atmosphere, emission at different wavelengths originates from different altitudes, which have different physical temperatures.\nThe temperature $T_{\\mathrm{peak}} = 673.9\\,\\mathrm{K}$ was derived by applying Wien's law, which is strictly valid for an ideal blackbody, to the peak of the observed spectrum. The peak of the observed spectrum, however, is the maximum of $F_\\lambda = \\epsilon(\\lambda) \\pi B_{\\lambda}(T_{\\mathrm{phys}}(\\lambda))$, not of $B_{\\lambda}$ itself.\n\n1.  **Wavelength-Dependent Emissivity and Molecular Absorption:** A real planetary atmosphere has a highly structured emissivity spectrum, characterized by strong molecular absorption bands (low $\\epsilon(\\lambda)$) and relatively transparent \"windows\" (high $\\epsilon(\\lambda)$). The peak of a spectrum at $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{peak}} = 4.30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ is particularly significant, as this corresponds to a very strong absorption band of carbon dioxide ($\\text{CO}_2$). Emission at the center of such a strong band originates from high altitudes in the planet's atmosphere, where the gas is optically thick and the temperature is typically lower than in deeper layers. In contrast, the atmospheric windows allow us to see emission from deeper, hotter layers.\n\n2.  **Bias against Effective Temperature:** The effective temperature $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is determined by the total power radiated across all wavelengths. The bulk of this power is emitted through the atmospheric windows, where the emissivity is high and the temperature of the emitting layers is high. The flux in strong absorption bands, coming from cold upper layers, contributes relatively little to the total integrated flux. Therefore, $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is generally representative of the higher temperatures of the deeper atmospheric layers.\n\nIn conclusion, the temperature $T_{\\mathrm{peak}} \\approx 673.9\\,\\mathrm{K}$ inferred from the peak at the $4.30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ $\\text{CO}_2$ band is a brightness temperature that probes the cold, high-altitude region of the planet's atmosphere. This value is expected to be significantly *lower* than the planet's effective temperature $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, which is a flux-weighted average temperature dominated by emission from hotter, deeper regions of the atmosphere. The temperature derived from a single spectral feature is thus a valuable probe of atmospheric structure but is not a measure of the planet's overall energy balance.",

Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of Top-of-Atmosphere Radiance**\nThe TOA monochromatic radiance, $I_\\lambda(\\text{TOA})$, for a non-scattering, plane-parallel atmosphere viewed at nadir is the sum of two components: 1) the surface emission attenuated by the atmosphere, and 2) the emission from the atmosphere itself.\n\n1.  The surface is Lambertian and assumed to be a blackbody (emissivity of $1$), so it emits with a spectral radiance given by Planck's law, $B_\\lambda(T_s)$.\n2.  The atmospheric transmittance, $\\mathcal{T}_\\lambda$, is the fraction of surface radiation that passes through the atmosphere without being absorbed.\n3.  The atmospheric spectral absorptivity, $\\alpha_\\lambda$, is the fraction of radiation absorbed. For a non-scattering medium, $\\mathcal{T}_\\lambda + \\alpha_\\lambda = 1$.\n4.  By Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation, for a medium in local thermodynamic equilibrium, the spectral emissivity $\\epsilon_\\lambda$ is equal to the spectral absorptivity $\\alpha_\\lambda$. Thus, $\\epsilon_\\lambda = \\alpha_\\lambda = 1 - \\mathcal{T}_\\lambda$, which implies $\\mathcal{T}_\\lambda = 1 - \\epsilon_\\lambda$.\n5.  The radiance from the surface that reaches the TOA is $B_\\lambda(T_s) \\mathcal{T}_\\lambda = B_\\lambda(T_s) (1 - \\epsilon_\\lambda)$.\n6.  The atmosphere is isothermal with temperature $T_a$, so it emits with a spectral radiance of $\\epsilon_\\lambda B_\\lambda(T_a)$.\n\nCombining these components, the total TOA monochromatic nadir radiance is:\n$$I_\\lambda(\\text{TOA}) = B_\\lambda(T_s) (1 - \\epsilon_\\lambda) + \\epsilon_\\lambda B_\\lambda(T_a)$$\nThis equation represents a linear combination of the radiances from the surface and the atmosphere, weighted by the atmospheric transmittance and emissivity, respectively.\n\n**Calculation of Brightness Temperature**\nThe spectral radiance of an ideal blackbody is given by Planck's law:\n$$B_\\lambda(T) = \\frac{2hc^2}{\\lambda^5} \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{hc}{\\lambda k_B T}\\right) - 1}$$\nThe problem is for a wavelength $\\lambda = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 1 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$. This falls within the specified atmospheric window, so the atmospheric emissivity is $\\epsilon_\\lambda = 0.15$.

A planet's spectrally integrated emission is characterized by an *effective temperature* $T_{eff}$, defined by this law. The brightness temperature $T_b(\\lambda)$ we calculated is, by contrast, a monochromatic (narrowband) quantity.\nIn this problem, the atmosphere has a spectral window at $8-12\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ where it is largely transparent ($\\epsilon_\\lambda=0.15$). In this window, an observer sees a mix of emission dominated by the warm surface at $T_s=300\\,\\mathrm{K}$. This is why the brightness temperature $T_b(10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}) \\approx 295.0\\,\\mathrm{K}$ is close to the surface temperature.\nOutside this window, the atmosphere is optically thick ($\\epsilon_\\lambda = 1$). An observer looking at the planet at these wavelengths would see only the emission from the top of the atmosphere, making a measurement of $I_\\lambda(\\text{TOA}) = B_\\lambda(T_a)$, which corresponds to a brightness temperature of $T_b(\\lambda) = T_a = 260\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\nThe effective temperature $T_{eff}$, derived from the Stefan-Boltzmann law applied to the total spectrum, would be an average of these different brightness temperatures, weighted by their energetic contribution. Since a large part of the thermal spectrum is emitted from the colder $260\\,\\mathrm{K}$ layer, $T_{eff}$ would be significantly lower than $295\\,\\mathrm{K}$ and closer to $260\\,\\mathrm{K}$. The atmospheric window thus allows us to probe the warmer surface, resulting in a band-specific brightness temperature that is much higher than the planet's overall effective temperature. This is a key principle used in remote sensing to determine surface temperatures of planets with atmospheres.",

It is defined such that $\\alpha = 0$ at superior conjunction, where the observer sees the hemisphere centered on the substellar point.\n*   **Radiation Properties:** The planet's thermal emission is assumed to be bolometric blackbody radiation. The photosphere is a Lambertian emitter.\n*   **Temperature Model:** The fourth power of the photospheric temperature, $T^4$, is a function of longitude $\\lambda$ only, given by $T^{4}(\\lambda) = T_{0}^{4} [1 + \\varepsilon \\cos(\\lambda - \\delta)]$.\n    *   $\\lambda$ is the longitude measured eastward from the substellar point.\n    *   $\\delta$ is the eastward angular offset of the hotspot.\n    *   $T_0$ is a characteristic temperature scale.\n    *   $\\varepsilon$ is a dimensionless amplitude of temperature variation, with $0  \\varepsilon  1$.\n*   **Exclusions:** The model ignores latitudinal temperature variations, limb darkening, thermal scattering, and any contribution from reflected starlight.\n*   **Objective:** Derive the exact, disk-integrated, bolometric thermal flux received at the observer, $F_{obs}$, as a function of $\\alpha$. The final expression must be in terms of $\\sigma$ (the Stefan-Boltzmann constant), $R$, $D$, $T_{0}$, $\\varepsilon$, $\\alpha$, and $\\delta$.\n\n#### **Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n*   **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is firmly grounded in the principles of radiative transfer, blackbody physics (Stefan-Boltzmann law), and standard planetary orbital mechanics. The Lambertian emitter is a standard starting assumption. The temperature model is a simplified Fourier representation, which is a common and valid approach for modeling atmospheric dynamics and heat transport on exoplanets.\n*   **Well-Posedness:** The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary physical parameters ($R, D, T_0, \\varepsilon, \\delta, \\sigma$) and geometric constraints ($\\alpha$, zero obliquity, equatorial view) to define a unique mathematical problem: the integration of radiance over a specified surface.\n*   **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, and quantitative terms. All variables are clearly defined.\n*   **Flaws Assessment:** The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, and poses a non-trivial but solvable physics problem. It is a standard-form problem in the study of exoplanet atmospheres.\n\n#### **Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. I will proceed with a rigorous derivation of the solution.\n\n### **Solution Derivation**\n\nThe fundamental principle is that the total flux received by an observer at distance $D$ is the integral of the radiance from all visible parts of the planetary disk, with each surface element's contribution weighted by its projected area towards the observer.\n\nThe bolometric radiance, $I$, of a blackbody surface with temperature $T$ is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law. For a Lambertian emitter, the radiance is uniform in all directions and is related to the total hemispherical exitance (flux), $F_{surf} = \\sigma T^4$, by $F_{surf} = \\pi I$. Therefore, the radiance is:\n$$ I = \\frac{\\sigma T^4}{\\pi} $$\nThe flux contribution, $dF_{obs}$, from a small surface element $dA$ is given by:\n$$ dF_{obs} = \\frac{I \\, dA_{\\text{proj}}}{D^2} = \\frac{I \\cos\\psi \\, dA}{D^2} $$\nwhere $\\psi$ is the emission angle, defined as the angle between the surface normal and the line of sight to the observer. We assume $D \\gg R$, so the observer is effectively at infinity.\n\nWe establish a planet-centered spherical coordinate system $(r, \\theta, \\phi)$, where $\\theta$ is the colatitude ($0 \\le \\theta \\le \\pi$) and $\\phi$ is the longitude. Since the viewing geometry is edge-on with zero obliquity, the orbital plane is the planet's equatorial plane. We align the coordinate system such that it co-rotates with the planet, and the substellar point (the point directly facing the star) is fixed at longitude $\\phi = 0$. In this frame, the problem's longitude $\\lambda$ is identical to our coordinate $\\phi$. The temperature distribution is thus:\n$$ T^4(\\phi) = T_0^4 [1 + \\varepsilon\\cos(\\phi - \\delta)] $$\nA surface element on the planet is $dA = R^2 \\sin\\theta d\\theta d\\phi$, and its outward normal vector is $\\hat{n}_{surf} = (\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi, \\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi, \\cos\\theta)$ in Cartesian coordinates.\n\nThe observer is at a phase angle $\\alpha$. In this co-rotating frame where the star is at a fixed position, the observer's direction changes. At phase $\\alpha$, the direction vector from the planet's center to the observer, $\\hat{n}_{obs}$, is in the equatorial plane and makes an angle $\\alpha$ with the star-planet line. With the substellar point at $\\phi=0$, the observer's direction is rotated by $\\alpha$ from this axis. So $\\hat{n}_{obs} = (\\cos\\alpha, \\sin\\alpha, 0)$.\n\nThe projection factor $\\cos\\psi$ is the dot product of the surface normal and the observer's direction:\n$$ \\cos\\psi = \\hat{n}_{surf} \\cdot \\hat{n}_{obs} = (\\sin\\theta\\cos\\phi)(\\cos\\alpha) + (\\sin\\theta\\sin\\phi)(\\sin\\alpha) + (\\cos\\theta)(0) = \\sin\\theta \\cos(\\phi - \\alpha) $$\nThe surface is visible to the observer only if $\\cos\\psi > 0$. Since $\\sin\\theta \\ge 0$ for $0 \\le \\theta \\le \\pi$, the visibility condition is $\\cos(\\phi - \\alpha) > 0$. This restricts the longitude to the range $\\alpha - \\frac{\\pi}{2}  \\phi  \\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nThe total disk-integrated flux, $F_{obs}(\\alpha)$, is the integral of $dF_{obs}$ over the visible hemisphere:\n$$ F_{obs}(\\alpha) = \\int_{\\text{visible disk}} dF_{obs} = \\int_{\\alpha - \\frac{\\pi}{2}}^{\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\frac{I(\\phi) \\cos\\psi}{D^2} (R^2 \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta d\\phi) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $I(\\phi)$ and $\\cos\\psi$:\n$$ F_{obs}(\\alpha) = \\frac{R^2}{D^2} \\int_{\\alpha - \\frac{\\pi}{2}}^{\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\frac{\\sigma T^4(\\phi)}{\\pi} (\\sin\\theta \\cos(\\phi - \\alpha)) \\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta d\\phi $$\nWe can separate the integrals over $\\theta$ and $\\phi$:\n$$ F_{obs}(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\sigma R^2}{\\pi D^2} \\left( \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sin^2\\theta \\, d\\theta \\right) \\left( \\int_{\\alpha - \\frac{\\pi}{2}}^{\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{2}} T^4(\\phi) \\cos(\\phi - \\alpha) \\, d\\phi \\right) $$\nFirst, evaluate the definite integral over $\\theta$:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\sin^2\\theta \\, d\\theta = \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\frac{1 - \\cos(2\\theta)}{2} \\, d\\theta = \\left[\\frac{\\theta}{2} - \\frac{\\sin(2\\theta)}{4}\\right]_{0}^{\\pi} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $$\nSubstituting this result, the flux expression simplifies to:\n$$ F_{obs}(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\sigma R^2}{2 D^2} \\int_{\\alpha - \\frac{\\pi}{2}}^{\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{2}} T^4(\\phi) \\cos(\\phi - \\alpha) \\, d\\phi $$\nNow, substitute the temperature model $T^4(\\phi) = T_0^4[1 + \\varepsilon\\cos(\\phi - \\delta)]$:\n$$ F_{obs}(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\sigma R^2 T_0^4}{2 D^2} \\int_{\\alpha - \\frac{\\pi}{2}}^{\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{2}} [1 + \\varepsilon\\cos(\\phi - \\delta)] \\cos(\\phi - \\alpha) \\, d\\phi $$\nThe integral can be split into two parts:\n$$ \\mathcal{I} = \\int_{\\alpha - \\frac{\\pi}{2}}^{\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\cos(\\phi - \\alpha) \\, d\\phi + \\varepsilon \\int_{\\alpha - \\frac{\\pi}{2}}^{\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\cos(\\phi - \\delta) \\cos(\\phi - \\alpha) \\, d\\phi $$\nThe first integral is:\n$$ \\int_{\\alpha - \\frac{\\pi}{2}}^{\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\cos(\\phi - \\alpha) \\, d\\phi = [\\sin(\\phi - \\alpha)]_{\\alpha - \\frac{\\pi}{2}}^{\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{2}} = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) - \\sin\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = 1 - (-1) = 2 $$\nFor the second integral, we use the product-to-sum identity $\\cos A \\cos B = \\frac{1}{2}[\\cos(A - B) + \\cos(A + B)]$ with $A = \\phi - \\delta$ and $B = \\phi - \\alpha$:\n$$ \\int \\cos(\\phi - \\delta) \\cos(\\phi - \\alpha) \\, d\\phi = \\frac{1}{2} \\int [\\cos(\\alpha - \\delta) + \\cos(2\\phi - \\alpha - \\delta)] \\, d\\phi $$\nEvaluating this definite integral:\n$$ \\frac{\\varepsilon}{2} \\left[ \\phi\\cos(\\alpha - \\delta) + \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(2\\phi - \\alpha - \\delta) \\right]_{\\alpha - \\frac{\\pi}{2}}^{\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{2}} $$\nThe first term evaluates to:\n$$ \\frac{\\varepsilon}{2} \\left( \\left(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) - \\left(\\alpha - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) \\right) \\cos(\\alpha - \\delta) = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{2} \\pi \\cos(\\alpha - \\delta) $$\nThe second term evaluates to:\n$$ \\frac{\\varepsilon}{4} \\left[ \\sin\\left(2\\left(\\alpha + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) - \\alpha - \\delta\\right) - \\sin\\left(2\\left(\\alpha - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) - \\alpha - \\delta\\right) \\right] $$\n$$ = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{4} \\left[ \\sin(\\pi + \\alpha - \\delta) - \\sin(-\\pi + \\alpha - \\delta) \\right] = \\frac{\\varepsilon}{4} \\left[ -\\sin(\\alpha - \\delta) - (-\\sin(\\alpha - \\delta)) \\right] = 0 $$\nThus, the total value of the integral $\\mathcal{I}$ is $2 + \\frac{\\pi\\varepsilon}{2}\\cos(\\alpha - \\delta)$.\n\nFinally, we substitute this back into the expression for $F_{obs}(\\alpha)$:\n$$ F_{obs}(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\sigma R^2 T_0^4}{2 D^2} \\left( 2 + \\frac{\\pi\\varepsilon}{2}\\cos(\\alpha - \\delta) \\right) $$\nSimplifying this expression gives the final analytical form for the observed flux:\n$$ F_{obs}(\\alpha) = \\frac{\\sigma R^2 T_0^4}{D^2} \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\pi\\varepsilon}{4}\\cos(\\alpha - \\delta) \\right) $$\nThis expression represents the disk-integrated bolometric thermal flux at the observer as a function of the phase angle $\\alpha$, accounting for the planet's size, distance, temperature structure, and hotspot offset.",
