            "problem": "An exoplanet of radius $R$ orbits a star such that the time-averaged stellar irradiance incident at the top of the planet’s atmosphere is $S$. The planet reflects a fraction $A$ of the incident radiation at all wavelengths of the stellar spectrum (its Bond albedo), and absorbs the remainder. In the thermal infrared, the planet behaves as a greybody with bolometric emissivity $\\epsilon$ that is independent of wavelength across its thermal emission band. Assume negligible internal heat sources and sinks, and that the horizontal redistribution of heat is sufficiently rapid compared to radiative timescales so that the planet emits uniformly across its entire surface with a single temperature $T$ in a steady state.\n\nStarting only from conservation of energy and the Stefan–Boltzmann law for thermal emission, derive a closed-form analytic expression for the planet’s global radiative-equilibrium temperature $T$ in terms of $S$, $A$, $\\epsilon$, and the Stefan–Boltzmann constant $\\sigma$. Then, articulate the minimal set of physical and geometrical assumptions under which this expression is valid, including the origin of any geometric factors that appear due to averaging over incidence and emission.\n\nProvide your final expression for $T$ in closed form.

            "solution": "The problem statement is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a self-contained description of a standard physical model in planetary science, free from contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThe derivation for the planet's global radiative-equilibrium temperature, $T$, proceeds from the fundamental principle of conservation of energy. For a planet in a thermal steady state with negligible internal heat sources, the power absorbed from its host star, $P_{\\text{absorbed}}$, must be equal to the thermal power it emits to space, $P_{\\text{emitted}}$.\n$$P_{\\text{absorbed}} = P_{\\text{emitted}}$$\n\nFirst, we formulate an expression for the absorbed power, $P_{\\text{absorbed}}$. The star provides a time-averaged irradiance $S$, which is the power per unit area incident on a surface perpendicular to the incoming radiation at the planet's orbital distance. The planet, being a sphere of radius $R$, intercepts this radiation over its geometric cross-section, which is a disk of area $A_{\\text{cross}} = \\pi R^2$. The total power incident on the planet is therefore the product of the irradiance and this intercept area.\n$$P_{\\text{incident}} = S \\cdot A_{\\text{cross}} = S \\pi R^2$$\nThe problem states that a fraction $A$ of this incident radiation is reflected back to space, where $A$ is the Bond albedo. The remaining fraction, $(1 - A)$, is absorbed by the planet. Thus, the total absorbed power is:\n$$P_{\\text{absorbed}} = (1 - A) P_{\\text{incident}} = (1 - A) S \\pi R^2$$\n\nNext, we formulate an expression for the emitted power, $P_{\\text{emitted}}$. The problem assumes that heat is redistributed efficiently across the planet, resulting in a single, uniform surface temperature $T$. The planet radiates this heat away into space from its entire spherical surface. The surface area of a sphere of radius $R$ is $A_{\\text{surface}} = 4 \\pi R^2$. According to the Stefan–Boltzmann law, the power radiated per unit area from a perfect blackbody is $\\sigma T^4$, where $\\sigma$ is the Stefan–Boltzmann constant. This planet is described as a greybody with a bolometric emissivity $\\epsilon$, which modifies the blackbody emission by this factor. Therefore, the power emitted per unit area by the planet is $\\epsilon \\sigma T^4$. The total power emitted over the entire surface is the product of this flux and the total surface area.\n$$P_{\\text{emitted}} = (\\epsilon \\sigma T^4) \\cdot A_{\\text{surface}} = \\epsilon \\sigma T^4 (4 \\pi R^2)$$\n\nNow, we apply the principle of energy conservation by equating the absorbed and emitted power.\n$$(1 - A) S \\pi R^2 = \\epsilon \\sigma T^4 (4 \\pi R^2)$$\nThe term $\\pi R^2$ appears on both sides of the equation and can be canceled. This demonstrates that, under the assumptions of this model, the equilibrium temperature is independent of the planet's size.\n$$(1 - A) S = 4 \\epsilon \\sigma T^4$$\n\nFinally, we solve for the temperature $T$ by isolating it.\n$$T^4 = \\frac{(1 - A) S}{4 \\epsilon \\sigma}$$\nTaking the fourth root of both sides gives the closed-form expression for the planet's radiative-equilibrium temperature.\n$$T = \\left( \\frac{(1 - A) S}{4 \\epsilon \\sigma} \\right)^{1/4}$$\n\nThe minimal set of physical and geometrical assumptions underpinning this expression is as follows:\n$1$. **Radiative Equilibrium:** The planet is in a steady state where the energy budget is balanced, meaning the absorbed solar power equals the emitted thermal power. This results in a constant global-mean temperature.\n$2$. **No Internal Heat Flux:** The model assumes that any contribution from internal heat sources (such as radioactive decay or primordial heat of formation) to the surface energy budget is negligible compared to the absorbed stellar energy.\n$3$. **Point-Source Star and Parallel Rays:** The star is assumed to be sufficiently distant that the incoming radiation can be treated as a set of parallel rays with uniform irradiance $S$.\n$4$. **Geometric Absorption and Emission:** The planet absorbs energy over its circular cross-sectional area ($\\pi R^2$), as this is the area it presents to the parallel incoming radiation. It emits energy over its entire spherical surface area ($4 \\pi R^2$). The ratio of these two areas, $\\frac{A_{\\text{surface}}}{A_{\\text{cross}}} = \\frac{4 \\pi R^2}{\\pi R^2} = 4$, gives rise to the geometric factor of $4$ in the denominator of the temperature expression. This factor represents the dilution of the absorbed energy over the full emitting surface.\n$5$. **Uniform Isothermal Surface:** The planet is assumed to have a single, uniform temperature $T$ across its entire surface and emits as an isotropic radiator. This implies a mechanism for perfect and rapid heat redistribution from the day side to the night side and from the equator to the poles, such as a thick, dynamic atmosphere or a global ocean.\n$6$. **Wavelength-Independent Optical Properties:** The Bond albedo $A$ is treated as a single constant representing the fraction of reflected power averaged over the entire stellar spectrum. Similarly, the emissivity $\\epsilon$ is a constant representing the emission efficiency averaged over the planet's thermal (infrared) emission spectrum. In this model, these parameters are independent of wavelength, temperature, or location on the planet. The term $\\epsilon < 1$ implicitly accounts for any greenhouse effect, as it describes a reduced efficiency of radiative cooling to space compared to a perfect blackbody.",

The equilibrium is therefore **linearly stable**.\n- If $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}F_{\\mathrm{net}}}{\\mathrm{d}T} > 0$, any small perturbation is amplified, and the equilibrium is **linearly unstable**.\n\nWe first compute the derivative of $F_{\\mathrm{net}}(T)$:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{net}}(T) = \\frac{S}{4}(1 - A(T)) - F_{0} - \\lambda T$$\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}F_{\\mathrm{net}}}{\\mathrm{d}T} = -\\frac{S}{4}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}A}{\\mathrm{d}T} - \\lambda$$\nThe derivative of the albedo is:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}A}{\\mathrm{d}T} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}T}\\left[A_{0} + a_{1}(T - T_{r}) + a_{3}(T - T_{r})^{3}\\right] = a_{1} + 3a_{3}(T-T_{r})^{2} = a_{1} + 3a_{3}\\theta^{2}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}F_{\\mathrm{net}}}{\\mathrm{d}T}$:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}F_{\\mathrm{net}}}{\\mathrm{d}T} = -\\frac{S}{4}(a_{1} + 3a_{3}\\theta^{2}) - \\lambda = -\\frac{S}{4}a_{1} - \\lambda - 3\\frac{S}{4}a_{3}\\theta^{2}$$\nUsing the definitions of our coefficients, $c_{1} = \\frac{S}{4}a_{1} + \\lambda$ and $c_{3} = \\frac{S}{4}a_{3}$, we can write this more compactly:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}F_{\\mathrm{net}}}{\\mathrm{d}T} = -( \\frac{S}{4}a_{1} + \\lambda ) - 3(\\frac{S}{4}a_{3})\\theta^{2} = -c_{1} - 3c_{3}\\theta^{2}$$\nNow we evaluate this derivative at each of the three equilibria:\n\n- **Equilibrium 1 ($T_{1} = 273\\ \\mathrm{K}$, $\\theta_{1}=0$):**\n$$\\left.\\frac{\\mathrm{d}F_{\\mathrm{net}}}{\\mathrm{d}T}\\right|_{T_{1}} = -c_{1} - 3c_{3}(0)^{2} = -c_{1} = -(-2.9025) = 2.9025$$\nSince $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}F_{\\mathrm{net}}}{\\mathrm{d}T} > 0$, the equilibrium $T_{1}$ is **unstable**.\n\n- **Equilibria 2 and 3 ($T_{2} \\approx 302.2\\ \\mathrm{K}$ and $T_{3} \\approx 243.8\\ \\mathrm{K}$):**\nFor these two equilibria, $\\theta^{2} = -\\frac{c_{1}}{c_{3}}$. Substituting this into the derivative expression:\n$$\\left.\\frac{\\mathrm{d}F_{\\mathrm{net}}}{\\mathrm{d}T}\\right|_{T_{2}, T_{3}} = -c_{1} - 3c_{3}\\left(-\\frac{c_{1}}{c_{3}}\\right) = -c_{1} + 3c_{1} = 2c_{1}$$\n$$2c_{1} = 2(-2.9025) = -5.805$$\nSince $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}F_{\\mathrm{net}}}{\\mathrm{d}T} < 0$, both equilibria $T_{2}$ and $T_{3}$ are **linearly stable**.\n\nThe three equilibrium temperatures, rounded to four significant figures, are:\n- The `warm` stable state: $T_{2} = 302.2\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n- The `cold` stable state (snowball): $T_{3} = 243.8\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n- The intermediate unstable state: $T_{1} = 273.0\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n\nArranging them in ascending order: $243.8\\ \\mathrm{K}$, $273.0\\ \\mathrm{K}$, $302.2\\ \\mathrm{K}$.",
