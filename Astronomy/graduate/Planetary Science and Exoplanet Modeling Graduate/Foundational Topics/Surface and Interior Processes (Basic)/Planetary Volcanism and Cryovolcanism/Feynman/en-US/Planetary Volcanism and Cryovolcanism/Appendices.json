            "solution": "The problem requires a two-part solution: first, the derivation of the linear relationship between freezing point depression and solute molality from fundamental thermodynamic principles; second, the application of this derived relationship to estimate a minimum solute mass fraction for a cryovolcanic brine.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Freezing Point Depression Relation\n\nThe starting point for this derivation is the condition of phase equilibrium. At the freezing point of the solution, $T_f$, the chemical potential of the solvent (water, denoted by subscript $w$) in the liquid phase, $\\mu_w^l$, must be equal to the chemical potential of the pure solid solvent (ice) with which it is in equilibrium, $\\mu_w^s$.\n$$\n\\mu_w^l(T_f, P, x_w) = \\mu_w^s(T_f, P)\n$$\nHere, we assume the solid phase is pure ice, so its chemical potential is that of a pure substance, $\\mu_w^{s,*} (T_f, P)$. For the solvent in the liquid phase, its chemical potential in an ideal solution is given by:\n$$\n\\mu_w^l(T_f, P, x_w) = \\mu_w^{l,*}(T_f, P) + RT_f \\ln(a_w)\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_w^{l,*}$ is the chemical potential of the pure liquid solvent, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $a_w$ is the activity of the solvent. The problem specifies using the ideal solution approximation, where the activity of the solvent is equal to its mole fraction, $a_w = x_w$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the equilibrium condition yields:\n$$\n\\mu_w^{l,*}(T_f, P) + RT_f \\ln(x_w) = \\mu_w^{s,*}(T_f, P)\n$$\nRearranging the terms gives an expression for the difference in chemical potential between the pure liquid and pure solid solvent, which is the molar Gibbs free energy of fusion, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fus}}$, at temperature $T_f$:\n$$\n\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fus}}(T_f) = \\mu_w^{l,*}(T_f, P) - \\mu_w^{s,*}(T_f, P) = -RT_f \\ln(x_w)\n$$\nTo find the relationship between the freezing temperature and the composition, we employ the Gibbs-Helmholtz equation, which describes the temperature dependence of the Gibbs free energy:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\partial (G/T)}{\\partial T} \\right)_P = -\\frac{H}{T^2}\n$$\nApplying this to the molar Gibbs free energy of fusion:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\partial (\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fus}}/T)}{\\partial T} \\right)_P = -\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fus}}}{T^2}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fus}}$ is the molar enthalpy of fusion. We can integrate this equation from the normal freezing point of the pure solvent, $T_f^0$, to the freezing point of the solution, $T_f$. We assume that $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fus}}$ is constant over this temperature range.\n$$\n\\int_{T=T_f^0}^{T=T_f} d\\left(\\frac{\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fus}}}{T}\\right) = \\int_{T_f^0}^{T_f} -\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fus}}}{T^2} dT\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fus}}(T_f)}{T_f} - \\frac{\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fus}}(T_f^0)}{T_f^0} = \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fus}} \\left[ \\frac{1}{T} \\right]_{T_f^0}^{T_f} = \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fus}} \\left( \\frac{1}{T_f} - \\frac{1}{T_f^0} \\right)\n$$\nAt the normal freezing point, $T_f^0$, the pure liquid and solid are in equilibrium, so $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fus}}(T_f^0) = 0$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fus}}(T_f)}{T_f} = \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fus}} \\left( \\frac{T_f^0 - T_f}{T_f T_f^0} \\right)\n$$\nNow, we substitute our earlier result, $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fus}}(T_f)/T_f = -R \\ln(x_w)$:\n$$\n-R \\ln(x_w) = \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fus}} \\frac{T_f^0 - T_f}{T_f T_f^0}\n$$\nThe freezing point depression is defined as $\\Delta T_f = T_f^0 - T_f$.\n$$\n\\ln(x_w) = -\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fus}}}{R} \\frac{\\Delta T_f}{T_f T_f^0}\n$$\nTo obtain the first-order linear relation for the dilute limit, we introduce several approximations. For a dilute solution, the mole fraction of the solute, $x_s$, is very small ($x_s \\ll 1$).\nThe mole fraction of the solvent is $x_w = 1 - x_s$. Using the Taylor expansion for the natural logarithm, $\\ln(1 - z) \\approx -z$ for small $z$, we have:\n$$\n\\ln(x_w) = \\ln(1 - x_s) \\approx -x_s\n$$\nAlso, for a small freezing point depression, the new freezing point $T_f$ is close to the original one, $T_f^0$, so we can approximate the product in the denominator as $T_f T_f^0 \\approx (T_f^0)^2$.\nSubstituting these approximations into our equation:\n$$\n-x_s \\approx -\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fus}}}{R} \\frac{\\Delta T_f}{(T_f^0)^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta T_f \\approx \\frac{R(T_f^0)^2}{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fus}}} x_s\n$$\nThe final step is to express the solute concentration in terms of molality, $m$, which is defined as moles of solute per kilogram of solvent ($m = n_s / m_{\\text{solvent,kg}}$). The mole fraction of the solute is $x_s = n_s / (n_s + n_w)$. For a dilute solution, $n_s \\ll n_w$, so $x_s \\approx n_s / n_w$. The number of moles of solvent is $n_w = m_w / M_w$, where $M_w$ is the molar mass of the solvent.\n$$\nx_s \\approx \\frac{n_s}{m_w/M_w} = \\left(\\frac{n_s}{m_w}\\right) M_w = m M_w\n$$\nNote that for this relation to be dimensionally consistent, if $m$ is in $\\mathrm{mol\\ kg}^{-1}$, $M_w$ must be in $\\mathrm{kg\\ mol}^{-1}$.\nSubstituting this expression for $x_s$ into the equation for $\\Delta T_f$:\n$$\n\\Delta T_f \\approx \\left(\\frac{R(T_f^0)^2 M_w}{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fus}}}\\right) m\n$$\nThis is the desired first-order relation, showing that the freezing point depression $\\Delta T_f$ is linearly proportional to the solute molality $m$. The proportionality constant is the cryoscopic constant, $K_f$:\n$$\nK_f = \\frac{R(T_f^0)^2 M_w}{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fus}}}\n$$\n\nPart 2: Estimation of Ammonia Mass Fraction\n\nThe problem asks for an estimate using the derived linear relation, $\\Delta T_f = K_f m$.\nThe given values are:\n$T_a = 265\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n$T_f^0 = 273.15\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n$M_w = 18.01528 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{kg\\ mol}^{-1}$\n$M_{\\mathrm{NH_{3}}} = 17.031 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{kg\\ mol}^{-1}$\n$\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fus}} = 6.01 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol}^{-1}$\n$R = 8.314462618\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the required freezing point depression. The liquid must remain unfrozen at $T_a$, so the solution's freezing point $T_f$ must be at most $T_a$. We set $T_f = T_a = 265\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n$$\n\\Delta T_f = T_f^0 - T_f = 273.15\\ \\mathrm{K} - 265\\ \\mathrm{K} = 8.15\\ \\mathrm{K}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the cryoscopic constant $K_f$ for water:\n$$\nK_f = \\frac{R(T_f^0)^2 M_w}{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fus}}} = \\frac{(8.314462618\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}) (273.15\\ \\mathrm{K})^2 (18.01528 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{kg\\ mol}^{-1})}{6.01 \\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol}^{-1}}\n$$\n$$\nK_f \\approx 1.85955\\ \\mathrm{K\\ kg\\ mol}^{-1}\n$$\nNow, we can find the required molality ($m_{\\mathrm{NH_3}}$) of the ammonia solution:\n$$\nm_{\\mathrm{NH_3}} = \\frac{\\Delta T_f}{K_f} = \\frac{8.15\\ \\mathrm{K}}{1.85955\\ \\mathrm{K\\ kg\\ mol}^{-1}} \\approx 4.3828\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ kg}^{-1}\n$$\nThis molality means there are $4.3828$ moles of ammonia ($\\mathrm{NH_3}$) for every $1\\ \\mathrm{kg}$ of water ($H_2O$).

            "solution": "The problem requires finding the maximum dynamic viscosity, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{max}}$, that allows a cryolava flow to travel a distance $L$ before it freezes solid. This involves two competing processes: the flow of the cryolava, governed by its viscosity, and its cooling, governed by heat conduction. The flow can reach the specified length $L$ only if the time it takes to travel this distance is less than or equal to the time it takes for the flow to freeze. The maximum viscosity corresponds to the case where the travel time equals the freezing time.\n\nFirst, we determine the characteristic timescale for the cryolava to freeze. The problem states that freezing is controlled by conductive heat loss into the substrate. The timescale for thermal diffusion, $\\tau_c$, over a characteristic length scale, in this case the flow thickness $h$, is given by:\n$$\n\\tau_c = \\frac{h^2}{\\kappa}\n$$\nThis timescale represents the time available for the lava to flow before it solidifies. The problem's assumption to neglect latent heat simplifies the freezing process to this single conductive cooling timescale. Let's designate this as the freezing time, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{freeze}}$.\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{freeze}} = \\frac{h^2}{\\kappa}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{freeze}} = \\frac{(1.3\\,\\mathrm{m})^2}{1.3 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}} = \\frac{1.69}{1.3 \\times 10^{-6}}\\,\\mathrm{s} = 1.3 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThis is the total time the cryolava has to flow.\n\nNext, we derive the average velocity of the cryolava flow. We model the flow as a sheet of a Newtonian fluid of thickness $h$ on a slope with angle $\\alpha$. Let's establish a coordinate system with the $x$-axis pointing downslope, parallel to the substrate, and the $z$-axis perpendicular to the substrate, pointing upwards into the flow. The base of the flow is at $z=0$ and the free surface is at $z=h$.\n\nFor steady, uniform, laminar flow, the momentum equation in the $x$-direction simplifies to a balance between the gravitational driving force and the viscous retarding force. The component of gravitational acceleration parallel to the slope is $g \\sin(\\alpha)$. The balance of forces per unit volume is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\tau_{zx}}{dz} + \\rho g \\sin(\\alpha) = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\tau_{zx}$ is the shear stress.

The corresponding heights are from the maximum central thickness, $h(0) = H_{\\max}$, to the edge thickness, $h(R) = 0$.\n$$ \\int_{0}^{R} \\tau_y dr = \\int_{H_{\\max}}^{0} -\\rho g h dh $$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$ \\tau_y [r]_{0}^{R} = -\\rho g \\left[\\frac{h^2}{2}\\right]_{H_{\\max}}^{0} $$\n$$ \\tau_y (R - 0) = -\\rho g \\left(\\frac{0^2}{2} - \\frac{H_{\\max}^2}{2}\\right) $$\n$$ \\tau_y R = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho g H_{\\max}^2 $$\nSolving for the maximum central thickness, $H_{\\max}$, we arrive at the desired expression:\n$$ H_{\\max}^2 = \\frac{2 \\tau_y R}{\\rho g} $$\n$$ H_{\\max} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\tau_y R}{\\rho g}} $$\n\n### Calculation\nWe are given the following parameters, which must be converted to standard SI units:\n-   $\\tau_y = 3.0 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{Pa} = 3.0 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{kg\\ m^{-1}\\ s^{-2}}$\n-   $R = 18\\ \\mathrm{km} = 18 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n-   $\\rho = 920\\ \\mathrm{kg\\ m^{-3}}$\n-   $g = 0.62\\ \\mathrm{m\\ s^{-2}}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $H_{\\max}$:\n$$ H_{\\max} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times (3.0 \\times 10^{4}) \\times (18 \\times 10^{3})}{920 \\times 0.62}} $$\n$$ H_{\\max} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1.08 \\times 10^{9}}{570.4}}\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\n$$ H_{\\max} = \\sqrt{1893408.1346...}\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\n$$ H_{\\max} \\approx 1375.997\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\nThe problem requires the answer in kilometers, rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ H_{\\max} \\approx 1.375997\\ \\mathrm{km} $$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$ H_{\\max} \\approx 1.376\\ \\mathrm{km} $$",
