The concept of a dense lithospheric slab sinking into the mantle due to negative buoyancy is a fundamental principle in geodynamics. The provided values for density contrast, gravity, and slab thickness are physically realistic for a terrestrial planet like Earth. The simplifications (neglecting viscous forces, uniform density) are standard for creating a first-order, analytically tractable model. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem asks for an order-of-magnitude estimate and guides the user toward a solution via dimensional analysis constrained by a specific set of variables ($\\Delta \\rho$, $g$, $h$). This structure ensures that a unique scaling law can be derived.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, and technical language, free from ambiguity or subjectivity.\n\n**1.3. Verdict and Action:**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a valid physics problem. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation and Solution\n\nThe problem asks for the slab-pull force per unit trench-parallel width, $F_{\\mathrm{sp}}$. This force is the result of the slab's negative buoyancy, meaning it is denser than the surrounding mantle material it displaces.\n\nAccording to Archimedes' principle, the net gravitational force (or buoyant force) on the slab is proportional to its volume and the density difference with the surrounding fluid (the mantle). The buoyant force per unit volume exerted on the slab is given by $f_b = \\Delta \\rho \\cdot g$, where $\\Delta \\rho$ is the density contrast and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nThe total force, $F$, is this force per unit volume integrated over the volume, $V$, of the subducted portion of the slab:\n$$F = \\int_V \\Delta \\rho g \\,dV$$\nFor a uniform density contrast, this simplifies to:\n$$F = \\Delta \\rho g V$$\nLet's model the slab as a rectangular sheet of thickness $h$, downdip length $L$, and trench-parallel width $W$. Its volume is $V = LWh$. The total slab-pull force is then $F = \\Delta \\rho g LWh$.\n\nThe problem asks for the force per unit trench-parallel width, $F_{\\mathrm{sp}} = F/W$.\n$$F_{\\mathrm{sp}} = \\frac{\\Delta \\rho g LWh}{W} = \\Delta \\rho g L h$$\nThis expression depends on the slab length, $L$, which is not provided as an input parameter for the final expression. The problem explicitly states that the final expression for $F_{\\mathrm{sp}}$ must be in terms of $\\Delta \\rho$, $g$, and $h$. This is a strong clue that we must use dimensional analysis, or make a simplifying assumption about $L$ based on the given parameters.\n\nLet's use dimensional analysis as instructed. We are looking for a quantity $F_{\\mathrm{sp}}$ with the units of force per unit length.\nThe dimensions of force are $[F] = [M][L][T]^{-2}$.\nThe dimensions of force per unit length are $[F_{\\mathrm{sp}}] = \\frac{[F]}{[L]} = \\frac{[M][L][T]^{-2}}{[L]} = [M][T]^{-2}$.\n\nNow, let's examine the dimensions of the given parameters:\n- Density contrast: $[\\Delta \\rho] = [M][L]^{-3}$\n- Gravitational acceleration: $[g] = [L][T]^{-2}$\n- Slab thickness: $[h] = [L]$\n\nWe seek to find exponents $a$, $b$, and $c$ such that $F_{\\mathrm{sp}} \\propto (\\Delta \\rho)^a g^b h^c$. Matching the dimensions:\n$$[M]^1 [L]^0 [T]^{-2} = \\left([M][L]^{-3}\\right)^a \\left([L][T]^{-2}\\right)^b \\left([L]\\right)^c$$\n$$[M]^1 [L]^0 [T]^{-2} = [M]^a [L]^{-3a+b+c} [T]^{-2b}$$\n\nEquating the exponents for each fundamental dimension:\n1.  For mass $[M]$: $a = 1$.\n2.  For time $[T]$: $-2b = -2 \\implies b = 1$.\n3.  For length $[L]$: $-3a + b + c = 0 \\implies -3(1) + 1 + c = 0 \\implies -2 + c = 0 \\implies c = 2$.\n\nThus, the combination of parameters with the correct units is $\\Delta \\rho g h^2$. For an order-of-magnitude estimate, we can assume the dimensionless constant of proportionality is unity.\n$$F_{\\mathrm{sp}} \\approx \\Delta \\rho g h^2$$\nThis result is consistent with the physical derivation $F_{\\mathrm{sp}} = \\Delta \\rho g L h$ if we make the order-of-magnitude assumption that the relevant downdip length of the slab, $L$, scales with its thickness, $h$. This is a simplification, but it is the one required by the problem's constraints. Alternatively, this model is equivalent to identifying the \"relevant participating slab volume per unit width\" (which is an area) as being $h^2$.\n\n### Step 3: Numerical Evaluation\n\nWe can now evaluate this expression using the provided values. First, we must ensure all values are in SI units.\n- $\\Delta \\rho = 80\\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$\n- $g = 9.8\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}$\n- $h = 80\\ \\mathrm{km} = 80 \\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n\nSubstituting these into our derived expression:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{sp}} = (80\\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}) \\times (9.8\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}) \\times (80 \\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{m})^2$$\n$$F_{\\mathrm{sp}} = 80 \\times 9.8 \\times (80^2 \\times (10^3)^2)\\ \\mathrm{N\\,m^{-1}}$$\n$$F_{\\mathrm{sp}} = 80 \\times 9.8 \\times 6400 \\times 10^6$$\n$$F_{\\mathrm{sp}} = (8 \\times 10^1) \\times 9.8 \\times (6.4 \\times 10^3) \\times 10^6$$\n$$F_{\\mathrm{sp}} = (8 \\times 9.8 \\times 6.4) \\times 10^{1+3+6}$$\n$$F_{\\mathrm{sp}} = 501.76 \\times 10^{10}$$\nExpressing this in standard scientific notation:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{sp}} = 5.0176 \\times 10^{12}\\ \\mathrm{N\\,m^{-1}}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to two significant figures.\n$$F_{\\mathrm{sp}} \\approx 5.0 \\times 10^{12}\\ \\mathrm{N\\,m^{-1}}$$\nThis represents the order-of-magnitude estimate for the slab-pull force per meter of trench length.",
