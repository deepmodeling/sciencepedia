Since the source is unresolved, its angular size is small, and the integral simplifies to the product of the spectral radiance and the total solid angle.\n$$\nF_{\\lambda} = B_{\\lambda}(T) \\Omega\n$$\nA spherical source of radius $R$ at a distance $d$ subtends a solid angle $\\Omega$ given by the ratio of its projected area (a disk of area $\\pi R^2$) to the square of the distance.\n$$\n\\Omega = \\frac{\\pi R^{2}}{d^{2}}\n$$\nTherefore, the spectral flux density from the object is:\n$$\nF_{\\lambda} = B_{\\lambda}(T) \\frac{\\pi R^{2}}{d^{2}}\n$$\nWe apply this general expression to both the star ($\\star$) and the planet ($p$).\n\nFor the star:\n$$\nF_{\\star} = B_{\\lambda}(T_{\\star}) \\frac{\\pi R_{\\star}^{2}}{d^{2}}\n$$\nFor the planet:\n$$\nF_{p} = B_{\\lambda}(T_{p}) \\frac{\\pi R_{p}^{2}}{d^{2}}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the flux-density contrast ratio, $F_{p}/F_{\\star}$.

In the pairwise probing method, two probes are used: $p$ and $i\\,p$, where $i$ is the imaginary unit and $p$ is a known complex amplitude at the pixel.

Due to model mismatch and chromatic/optical aberrations, the true plant is related to the model by $H = (1+\\delta)\\exp(i\\phi)\\,\\hat{H}$, where $\\delta$ is a small real-valued fractional amplitude error and $\\phi$ is a phase error. Assume the phase error $\\phi$ is constant over iterations and is specified in degrees in this problem; you must convert degrees to radians before using trigonometric functions.\n\nStarting only from linear superposition of electric fields and the above control definition, derive the iteration for $E_{k+1}$ in terms of $E_k$, and show how the contrast $C_N$ after $N$ iterations depends on the loop gain $\\gamma$, the mismatch parameters $\\delta$ and $\\phi$, and the initial contrast $C_0 = |E_0|^{2}$. Then, derive the condition on $\\gamma$ that guarantees the control loop will not diverge (i.e., the magnitude of the iteration multiplier is strictly less than $1$), and express it as a bound on $\\gamma$ in terms of $\\delta$ and $\\phi$.\n\nFor the numerical evaluation, use $C_0 = 3.0 \\times 10^{-8}$, $\\delta = 0.10$, $\\phi = 15$ degrees, $\\gamma = 0.50$, and $N = 12$. Compute:\n- the residual contrast $C_N$ after $N$ iterations, expressed in decimal form and rounded to three significant figures, and\n- the maximum stable loop gain $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{max}}$ implied by your stability condition, rounded to four significant figures.\n\nReport your final answer as two numbers in a single row matrix, in the order $\\big(C_N,\\ \\gamma_{\\mathrm{max}}\\big)$. Angles must be in radians when used inside trigonometric functions. No percentage signs are allowed; contrast is dimensionless.",
            "solution": "The physical starting point is linear superposition of electric fields in the focal plane under a coronagraph in the small-aberration regime. If $E_k$ is the complex speckle field at iteration $k$, and the DM applies a field $H u_k$, then the next-iteration field is\n$$\nE_{k+1} = E_k + H u_k.\n$$\nThe control command is specified as\n$$\nu_k = -\\gamma \\frac{E_k}{\\hat{H}},\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma > 0$ is the loop gain and $\\hat{H}$ is the estimated plant. The true plant is related to the model by\n$$\nH = (1+\\delta)\\exp(i\\phi)\\,\\hat{H},\n$$\nwith real $\\delta$ and $\\phi$ constant.
