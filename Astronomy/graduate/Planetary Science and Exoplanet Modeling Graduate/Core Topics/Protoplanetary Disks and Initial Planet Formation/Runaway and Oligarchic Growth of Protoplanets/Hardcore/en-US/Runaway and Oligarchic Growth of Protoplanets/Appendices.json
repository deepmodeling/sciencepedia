            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It constitutes a standard problem in celestial mechanics and planetary accretion theory, based on fundamental principles of physics. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem requires us to analyze the two-body gravitational interaction between a protoplanet of mass $M$ and radius $R$, and a test planetesimal. We will use the principles of conservation of a test particle's specific mechanical energy and specific angular momentum in the central gravitational field of the protoplanet. The planetesimal is treated as a point mass, and its mass $m$ is considered negligible such that $m \\ll M$, so the protoplanet can be treated as a fixed center of force.\n\nLet the initial state of the planetesimal be at an infinite distance ($r \\to \\infty$) from the protoplanet, with an asymptotic relative speed $v_{\\text{rel}}$ and an impact parameter $b$. The impact parameter $b$ is the perpendicular distance between the protoplanet and the initial velocity vector of the planetesimal. Let the state at the point of closest approach (pericenter) be characterized by a pericenter distance $r_p$ and a speed $v_p$.\n\nFirst, we apply the law of conservation of specific angular momentum. The specific angular momentum, $L/m$, is conserved throughout the trajectory.\nAt infinity, the position and velocity vectors are asymptotically perpendicular at a distance $b$, so the specific angular momentum is:\n$$ \\frac{L_{\\infty}}{m} = b v_{\\text{rel}} $$\nAt pericenter, the position and velocity vectors are exactly perpendicular, so the specific angular momentum is:\n$$ \\frac{L_p}{m} = r_p v_p $$\nBy conservation of angular momentum, $L_{\\infty}/m = L_p/m$, which gives:\n$$ b v_{\\text{rel}} = r_p v_p $$\n\nNext, we apply the law of conservation of specific mechanical energy, $E/m$.\nAt infinity, the gravitational potential energy is zero, $U_{\\infty} = -\\frac{GMm}{r} \\to 0$ as $r \\to \\infty$. The specific energy is purely kinetic:\n$$ \\frac{E_{\\infty}}{m} = \\frac{1}{2} v_{\\text{rel}}^2 $$\nAt pericenter, the specific energy is the sum of kinetic and potential energies:\n$$ \\frac{E_p}{m} = \\frac{1}{2} v_p^2 - \\frac{GM}{r_p} $$\nBy conservation of energy, $E_{\\infty}/m = E_p/m$, which gives:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} v_{\\text{rel}}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} v_p^2 - \\frac{GM}{r_p} $$\n\nWe now have a system of two equations with two unknowns, $v_p$ and $r_p$. We can solve for the pericenter distance $r_p$ in terms of the initial conditions $b$ and $v_{\\text{rel}}$. From the angular momentum conservation equation, we express $v_p$ as:\n$$ v_p = \\frac{b v_{\\text{rel}}}{r_p} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $v_p$ into the energy conservation equation:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} v_{\\text{rel}}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{b v_{\\text{rel}}}{r_p} \\right)^2 - \\frac{GM}{r_p} $$\nMultiplying the entire equation by $2$ and rearranging to solve for $b^2$:\n$$ v_{\\text{rel}}^2 = \\frac{b^2 v_{\\text{rel}}^2}{r_p^2} - \\frac{2GM}{r_p} $$\n$$ v_{\\text{rel}}^2 r_p^2 = b^2 v_{\\text{rel}}^2 - 2GM r_p $$\n$$ b^2 v_{\\text{rel}}^2 = v_{\\text{rel}}^2 r_p^2 + 2GM r_p $$\n$$ b^2 = r_p^2 + \\frac{2GM r_p}{v_{\\text{rel}}^2} $$\nThis equation relates the impact parameter $b$ to the pericenter distance $r_p$.\n\nA collision occurs if the planetesimal's trajectory intersects the protoplanet, which means the pericenter distance must be less than or equal to the protoplanet's physical radius, i.e., $r_p \\le R$. Since $b^2$ is a monotonically increasing function of $r_p$ (for $r_p > 0$), the maximum impact parameter, $b_{\\max}$, that still results in a collision corresponds to the case where the pericenter distance is exactly equal to the radius of the protoplanet, $r_p = R$.\nSetting $b = b_{\\max}$ and $r_p = R$ in our derived equation:\n$$ b_{\\max}^2 = R^2 + \\frac{2GMR}{v_{\\text{rel}}^2} $$\nWe can factor out $R^2$ to write this as:\n$$ b_{\\max}^2 = R^2 \\left( 1 + \\frac{2GM}{R v_{\\text{rel}}^2} \\right) $$\nThis is the expression for the square of the maximum impact parameter for collision.\n\nThe collisional cross-section, $\\sigma$, is the area of a circle with radius $b_{\\max}$:\n$$ \\sigma = \\pi b_{\\max}^2 $$\nSubstituting the expression for $b_{\\max}^2$:\n$$ \\sigma = \\pi R^2 \\left( 1 + \\frac{2GM}{R v_{\\text{rel}}^2} \\right) $$\nThe term $\\pi R^2$ is the geometric cross-section of the protoplanet. The factor $\\left(1 + \\frac{2GM}{R v_{\\text{rel}}^2}\\right)$ is known as the gravitational focusing factor, which enhances the cross-section beyond its geometric value. It is noteworthy that the quantity $\\sqrt{2GM/R}$ is the escape velocity, $v_{\\text{esc}}$, from the surface of the protoplanet.\n\nThe problem asks for the critical relative speed, $v_{\\text{rel,crit}}$, at which the collisional cross-section $\\sigma$ is exactly twice the geometric cross-section $\\sigma_{\\text{geom}} = \\pi R^2$.\nThe condition is:\n$$ \\sigma = 2 \\sigma_{\\text{geom}} $$\n$$ \\pi R^2 \\left( 1 + \\frac{2GM}{R v_{\\text{rel,crit}}^2} \\right) = 2 \\pi R^2 $$\nAssuming $R \\ne 0$, we can divide both sides by $\\pi R^2$:\n$$ 1 + \\frac{2GM}{R v_{\\text{rel,crit}}^2} = 2 $$\nSubtracting $1$ from both sides gives:\n$$ \\frac{2GM}{R v_{\\text{rel,crit}}^2} = 1 $$\nFinally, we solve for $v_{\\text{rel,crit}}^2$:\n$$ v_{\\text{rel,crit}}^2 = \\frac{2GM}{R} $$\nTaking the square root (as speed is a non-negative scalar), we obtain the expression for the critical relative speed:\n$$ v_{\\text{rel,crit}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2GM}{R}} $$\nThis critical speed is precisely equal to the escape velocity from the surface of the protoplanet.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the mass dependence of the fractional growth rate, $d\\ln M/dt$, for a protoplanet under two distinct growth regimes, and to compute the ratio of these rates for two protoplanets of mass $M$ and $2M$.\n\nFirst, we establish the general expression for the mass growth rate, $dM/dt$. The rate of mass accretion is given by the product of the mass density of the accreted material (planetesimals), the relative velocity, and the accretion cross-section.\nThe mass density of the planetesimal disk is $\\rho_{\\text{disk}} = n m_{\\text{s}}$, where $n$ is the number density and $m_{\\text{s}}$ is the mass of a single planetesimal.\nUsing the provided definitions, $n = \\Sigma/(2 H m_{\\text{s}})$ and $H = v_{\\text{rel}}/\\Omega$, we can write the mass density as:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\text{disk}} = \\left( \\frac{\\Sigma}{2 H m_{\\text{s}}} \\right) m_{\\text{s}} = \\frac{\\Sigma}{2H} = \\frac{\\Sigma}{2 (v_{\\text{rel}}/\\Omega)} = \\frac{\\Sigma \\Omega}{2 v_{\\text{rel}}}\n$$\nThe mass growth rate $dM/dt$ is the flux of mass through the protoplanet's accretion cross-section $\\sigma_{\\text{acc}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt} = \\rho_{\\text{disk}} \\cdot v_{\\text{rel}} \\cdot \\sigma_{\\text{acc}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\rho_{\\text{disk}}$ and the given $\\sigma_{\\text{acc}} = \\pi R^2 F_g(M)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt} = \\left( \\frac{\\Sigma \\Omega}{2 v_{\\text{rel}}} \\right) v_{\\text{rel}} (\\pi R^2 F_g(M)) = \\frac{\\pi \\Sigma \\Omega}{2} R^2 F_g(M)\n$$\nThe fractional growth rate is defined as $\\frac{d\\ln M}{dt} = \\frac{1}{M} \\frac{dM}{dt}$.\n$$\n\\frac{d\\ln M}{dt} = \\frac{1}{M} \\left( \\frac{\\pi \\Sigma \\Omega}{2} R^2 F_g(M) \\right)\n$$\nTo determine the mass dependence, we express the terms $R$ and $F_g(M)$ as functions of $M$. The quantities $\\pi$, $\\Sigma$, and $\\Omega$ are considered constant with respect to the protoplanet mass $M$.\n\nThe radius $R$ is given by $R(M) = \\left( \\frac{3M}{4\\pi \\rho_{\\text{int}}} \\right)^{1/3}$. The internal density $\\rho_{\\text{int}}$ is constant, so $R \\propto M^{1/3}$. Consequently, $R^2 \\propto M^{2/3}$.\n\nThe gravitational focusing factor is $F_g(M) = 1 + v_{\\text{esc}}^{2}/v_{\\text{rel}}^{2}$. The escape speed squared is $v_{\\text{esc}}^2 = 2GM/R$. Since $R \\propto M^{1/3}$, we have $v_{\\text{esc}}^2 \\propto M/M^{1/3} = M^{2/3}$.\n\nSubstituting the mass dependence of $R^2$ into the fractional growth rate expression:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\ln M}{dt} \\propto \\frac{1}{M} (M^{2/3}) F_g(M) = M^{-1/3} F_g(M)\n$$\nThis general scaling relation forms the basis for analyzing the two specific regimes.\n\n**1. Runaway Growth Regime**\n\nIn this regime, the planetesimal velocity dispersion $v_{\\text{rel}}$ is constant and independent of the protoplanet mass $M$. The term \"runaway growth\" refers to the phase where accretion is dominated by gravitational focusing, which occurs when the protoplanet's escape speed significantly exceeds the planetesimals' velocity dispersion, i.e., $v_{\\text{esc}} \\gg v_{\\text{rel}}$. In this limit, the focusing factor becomes:\n$$\nF_g(M) = 1 + \\frac{v_{\\text{esc}}^2}{v_{\\text{rel}}^2} \\approx \\frac{v_{\\text{esc}}^2}{v_{\\text{rel}}^2}\n$$\nSince $v_{\\text{rel}}$ is constant and $v_{\\text{esc}}^2 \\propto M^{2/3}$, the focusing factor scales as $F_g(M) \\propto M^{2/3}$.\n\nNow we determine the mass dependence of the fractional growth rate in this regime:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{d\\ln M}{dt}\\right)_{\\text{runaway}} \\propto M^{-1/3} F_g(M) \\propto M^{-1/3} M^{2/3} = M^{1/3}\n$$\nThe fractional growth rate is proportional to $M^{1/3}$. This indicates that more massive bodies grow fractionally faster, leading to a \"runaway\" process where the mass difference between bodies is amplified.\n\nWe compute the ratio $r_{\\text{runaway}}$ for protoplanets of mass $2M$ and $M$:\n$$\nr_{\\text{runaway}} = \\frac{\\left( d\\ln M/dt \\right)_{2M}}{\\left( d\\ln M/dt \\right)_{M}} = \\frac{(2M)^{1/3}}{(M)^{1/3}} = 2^{1/3}\n$$\n\n**2. Oligarchic Growth Regime**\n\nIn this regime, the velocity dispersion of the planetesimals is stirred up by the most massive protoplanets (the \"oligarchs\"), leading to $v_{\\text{rel}} \\propto v_{\\text{esc}}(M)$. Let $v_{\\text{rel}} = k v_{\\text{esc}}$ for some constant of proportionality $k$. The gravitational focusing factor becomes:\n$$\nF_g(M) = 1 + \\frac{v_{\\text{esc}}^2}{v_{\\text{rel}}^2} = 1 + \\frac{v_{\\text{esc}}^2}{(k v_{\\text{esc}})^2} = 1 + \\frac{1}{k^2}\n$$\nIn this regime, $F_g(M)$ is a constant, independent of the protoplanet mass $M$, as stated in the problem.\n\nWe substitute this into the general expression for the fractional growth rate's mass dependence:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{d\\ln M}{dt}\\right)_{\\text{oligarchic}} \\propto M^{-1/3} F_g(M)\n$$\nSince $F_g(M)$ is constant, the scaling is:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{d\\ln M}{dt}\\right)_{\\text{oligarchic}} \\propto M^{-1/3}\n$$\nThe fractional growth rate is inversely proportional to the cube root of the mass. This means that less massive bodies grow fractionally faster, allowing them to catch up to the larger oligarchs and leading to a more uniform mass distribution among the largest bodies.\n\nWe compute the ratio $r_{\\text{oligarchic}}$:\n$$\nr_{\\text{oligarchic}} = \\frac{\\left( d\\ln M/dt \\right)_{2M}}{\\left( d\\ln M/dt \\right)_{M}} = \\frac{(2M)^{-1/3}}{(M)^{-1/3}} = 2^{-1/3}\n$$\n\n**Conclusion on Mass Ratio Amplification**\n\nThe evolution of the mass ratio $\\mu = M_2/M_1$ (with $M_2 > M_1$) is governed by the sign of $\\frac{d\\ln\\mu}{dt} = \\frac{d\\ln M_2}{dt} - \\frac{d\\ln M_1}{dt}$. The mass ratio is amplified if $\\frac{d\\ln\\mu}{dt} > 0$, which implies that the fractional growth rate is an increasing function of mass. This corresponds to a ratio $r > 1$.\n- In the runaway regime, $r_{\\text{runaway}} = 2^{1/3} \\approx 1.26 > 1$, so this regime amplifies the mass ratio.\n- In the oligarchic regime, $r_{\\text{oligarchic}} = 2^{-1/3} \\approx 0.79 < 1$, so this regime tends to equalize masses, damping the mass ratio.\n\nThe problem requires the ordered pair $(r_{\\text{runaway}}, r_{\\text{oligarchic}})$.\nThe final answer is $(2^{1/3}, 2^{-1/3})$.",
