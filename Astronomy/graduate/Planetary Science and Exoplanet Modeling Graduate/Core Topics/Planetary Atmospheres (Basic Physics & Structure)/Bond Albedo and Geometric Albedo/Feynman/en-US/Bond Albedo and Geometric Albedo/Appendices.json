            "problem": "An exoplanet with radius $R$ is modeled as a uniform, perfectly diffusing (Lambertian) sphere whose surface reflectance is unity. The star is a distant point source delivering a collimated irradiance $F_{\\star}$ at the planet, and the observer is also in the far field at distance $\\Delta$, so that radiance is preserved along straight lines. The Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) for a Lambert surface is $1/\\pi$, and the radiance emitted from a surface element under collimated illumination with incidence zenith angle $\\theta_{0}$ is $I = \\left(F_{\\star}/\\pi\\right)\\cos\\theta_{0}$, independent of emission direction. The geometric albedo $p$ is defined as the ratio of the observed flux of the body at full phase ($\\alpha=0$) to that of a flat, perfectly diffusing Lambertian disk of the same cross-sectional area, illuminated and observed face-on, both with unit reflectance. The planetary phase angle $\\alpha$ is the angle at the planet between the star and the observer directions; use $\\alpha$ in radians throughout. The disk-integrated phase function $\\Phi(\\alpha)$ is defined by $F(\\alpha)=F(0)\\,\\Phi(\\alpha)$, where $F(\\alpha)$ is the total flux from the Lambert sphere observed at phase angle $\\alpha$, and is normalized such that $\\Phi(0)=1$.\n\nStarting from Lambert’s cosine law and radiance invariance, and using only spherical geometry and energy conservation:\n- Derive the Lambert-sphere phase function $\\Phi_{L}(\\alpha)$ by expressing the observed flux as a surface integral over the intersection of the illuminated and visible hemispheres and performing the integral in terms of $\\alpha$.\n- Using this $\\Phi_{L}(\\alpha)$, compute the geometric albedo $p$ of the Lambert sphere with unit reflectance and demonstrate it equals the exact fraction $2/3$.\n- Compute the phase integral $q_{L}$ defined by $q_{L}=2\\int_{0}^{\\pi}\\Phi_{L}(\\alpha)\\sin\\alpha\\,\\mathrm{d}\\alpha$ (with $\\alpha$ in radians), and provide its exact value.\n- Using the definition of Bond albedo $A_{B}$ as the fraction of incident power reflected over all scattering angles, and the standard relation $A_{B}=q\\,p$ connecting the Bond albedo, geometric albedo, and phase integral, compute the exact Bond albedo $A_{B}$ for this Lambert sphere.\n\nProvide exact values for $p$, $q_{L}$, and $A_{B}$.

Flux from the Lambert Sphere at Full Phase ($F(0)$)**\nThe observed flux from a surface element $dS$ is $dF = I \\cos\\theta_e \\frac{dS}{\\Delta^2}$, where $I$ is the radiance, $\\theta_e$ is the emission angle, and $\\Delta$ is the distance to the observer.

            "solution": "The solution proceeds by addressing the three tasks specified in the problem statement. The fundamental principle is the linearity of radiative transfer.

Therefore, for a mixture BRDF $r(f) = f\\,r_{\\mathrm{L}} + (1-f)\\,r_{\\mathrm{LS}}$, the disk-integrated flux is also a linear combination of the fluxes from the pure components:\n$$I(\\alpha; f) = f\\,I_{\\mathrm{L}}(\\alpha) + (1-f)\\,I_{\\mathrm{LS}}(\\alpha)$$\nwhere $I_{\\mathrm{L}}(\\alpha)$ and $I_{\\mathrm{LS}}(\\alpha)$ are the disk-integrated fluxes from pure Lambertian and Lommel-Seeliger spheres, respectively, and $f$ is the mixing ratio.\n\n**1. Derivation of $p(f)$ and $q(f)$**\n\nThe geometric albedo, $p$, is defined as being directly proportional to the disk-integrated flux at zero phase angle, $I(\\alpha=0)$. Let the constant of proportionality be $C$. Then $p = C \\cdot I(0)$. Applying this to the mixture:\n$$p(f) = C \\cdot I(0; f) = C \\cdot [f\\,I_{\\mathrm{L}}(0) + (1-f)\\,I_{\\mathrm{LS}}(0)]$$\n$$p(f) = f \\cdot [C \\cdot I_{\\mathrm{L}}(0)] + (1-f) \\cdot [C \\cdot I_{\\mathrm{LS}}(0)]$$\nRecognizing that $p_{\\mathrm{L}} = C \\cdot I_{\\mathrm{L}}(0)$ and $p_{\\mathrm{LS}} = C \\cdot I_{\\mathrm{LS}}(0)$, we obtain the geometric albedo of the mixture:\n$$p(f) = f\\,p_{\\mathrm{L}} + (1-f)\\,p_{\\mathrm{LS}}$$\nThe phase integral of the mixture, $q(f)$, is given by $q(f) = 2\\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\Phi(\\alpha; f)\\,\\sin\\alpha\\,\\mathrm{d}\\alpha$, where the phase function is $\\Phi(\\alpha; f) = \\frac{I(\\alpha; f)}{I(0; f)}$.

A similar relation holds for the Lommel-Seeliger component. Substituting these back:\n$$q(f) = \\frac{f \\cdot [I_{\\mathrm{L}}(0) q_{\\mathrm{L}}] + (1-f) \\cdot [I_{\\mathrm{LS}}(0) q_{\\mathrm{LS}}]}{f\\,I_{\\mathrm{L}}(0) + (1-f)\\,I_{\\mathrm{LS}}(0)}$$\nUsing the relations $p_{\\mathrm{L}} \\propto I_{\\mathrm{L}}(0)$ and $p_{\\mathrm{LS}} \\propto I_{\\mathrm{LS}}(0)$, the common proportionality constant cancels, yielding:\n$$q(f) = \\frac{f\\,p_{\\mathrm{L}}q_{\\mathrm{L}} + (1-f)\\,p_{\\mathrm{LS}}q_{\\mathrm{LS}}}{f\\,p_{\\mathrm{L}} + (1-f)\\,p_{\\mathrm{LS}}}$$\n\n**2. Computation and Simplification of $A_{B}(f)$**\n\nThe Bond albedo of the mixture is $A_{B}(f) = p(f)q(f)$. Substituting the expressions derived above:\n$$A_{B}(f) = [f\\,p_{\\mathrm{L}} + (1-f)\\,p_{\\mathrm{LS}}] \\left( \\frac{f\\,p_{\\mathrm{L}}q_{\\mathrm{L}} + (1-f)\\,p_{\\mathrm{LS}}q_{\\mathrm{LS}}}{f\\,p_{\\mathrm{L}} + (1-f)\\,p_{\\mathrm{LS}}} \\right)$$\nThe term $(f\\,p_{\\mathrm{L}} + (1-f)\\,p_{\\mathrm{LS}})$ cancels, as it is non-zero for any physical surface. This leaves:\n$$A_{B}(f) = f\\,p_{\\mathrm{L}}q_{\\mathrm{L}} + (1-f)\\,p_{\\mathrm{LS}}q_{\\mathrm{LS}}$$\nUsing the definition of the pure-component Bond albedos, $A_{B,L} = p_{\\mathrm{L}}q_{\\mathrm{L}}$ and $A_{B,LS} = p_{\\mathrm{LS}}q_{\\mathrm{LS}}$:\n$$A_{B}(f) = f\\,A_{B,L} + (1-f)\\,A_{B,LS}$$\nThe problem states that both pure components are perfectly reflecting, meaning their Bond albedos are unity: $A_{B,L}=1$ and $A_{B,LS}=1$. Substituting these values:\n$$A_{B}(f) = f(1) + (1-f)(1) = f + 1 - f$$\n$$A_{B}(f) = 1$$\nThis result confirms that if no energy is absorbed by the individual components, no energy can be absorbed by any mixture of them.\n\n**3. Analysis of $p(f)$ and $q(f)$**\n\nWe use canonical values for the pure components assuming they are perfectly reflective ($A_{B}=1$).\n- **Lambertian Sphere**: A perfectly reflective Lambertian sphere has a geometric albedo $p_{\\mathrm{L}} = 2/3$ and a phase integral $q_{\\mathrm{L}} = 3/2$. Check: $A_{B,L} = p_{\\mathrm{L}}q_{\\mathrm{L}} = (2/3)(3/2)=1$.\n- **Lommel-Seeliger Sphere**: A perfectly reflective (single-scattering albedo of unity) Lommel-Seeliger sphere has a geometric albedo $p_{\\mathrm{LS}} = 1/2$. Given the constraint $A_{B,LS}=1$, its phase integral must be $q_{\\mathrm{LS}} = A_{B,LS}/p_{\\mathrm{LS}} = 1/(1/2)=2$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expressions for $p(f)$ and $q(f)$:\n- **Geometric albedo $p(f)$**:\n$$p(f) = f \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right) + (1-f)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3}f + \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}f = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{6}f$$\nAs the mixing ratio $f$ increases from $0$ (pure Lommel-Seeliger) to $1$ (pure Lambert), the geometric albedo $p(f)$ increases linearly from $p(0)=1/2$ to $p(1)=2/3$. The mixture becomes brighter at zero phase as the more reflective Lambertian component dominates.\n\n- **Phase integral $q(f)$**:\nSince $A_{B}(f) = p(f)q(f) = 1$, we must have $q(f) = 1/p(f)$.\n$$q(f) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{6}f} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{3+f}{6}} = \\frac{6}{3+f}$$\nAs $f$ increases from $0$ to $1$, the phase integral $q(f)$ decreases non-linearly from $q(0)=6/3=2$ to $q(1)=6/4=3/2$. This inverse relationship shows that as the surface becomes more geometrically reflective at opposition (increasing $p(f)$), it must scatter light less efficiently over all angles (decreasing $q(f)$) to conserve total energy. The increase in $p(f)$ is exactly compensated by the decrease in $q(f)$ to maintain $A_B(f)=1$.",

The physical reasoning is also correct: the total energy reflected is an integral over solid angle. The solid angle element near opposition is $2\\pi\\sin\\alpha d\\alpha \\approx 2\\pi\\alpha d\\alpha$. The enhanced brightness exists over a phase angle range of $\\sim w$, so its contribution to the total reflected energy scales with an integral over a solid angle of size $\\sim w^2$. As $w \\to 0$, this contribution vanishes. This statement is **correct**.\n\n*   **D:** Incorrectly implies that $p$ must always be $\\le 1$. Our analysis shows this is not required for energy conservation if the opposition surge is narrow enough. This statement is **incorrect**.\n\nBoth statements A and C are correct descriptions of the physical situation.",
