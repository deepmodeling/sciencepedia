            "introduction": "The foundation of characterizing an exoplanet's atmosphere lies in understanding its basic vertical structure, which is governed by its mass, radius, and temperature. This first exercise guides you through the process of calculating the atmospheric scale height, $H$, from first principles and demonstrates how this fundamental parameter shapes the features we observe in transmission spectra. By propagating the measurement uncertainties in planetary mass ($M_p$) and radius ($R_p$), you will gain a practical understanding of how data precision limits our ability to characterize an atmosphere .",

            "problem": "A close-in gas giant (“hot Jupiter”) is modeled as an isothermal atmosphere with mean molecular mass and in hydrostatic equilibrium under Newtonian gravity. Consider a typical hot Jupiter with planetary mass $M_{p} = 1.00\\,M_{\\mathrm{J}}$ and planetary radius $R_{p} = 1.20\\,R_{\\mathrm{J}}$, where $M_{\\mathrm{J}}$ is Jupiter’s mass and $R_{\\mathrm{J}}$ is Jupiter’s radius. The atmosphere is assumed to be dominated by molecular hydrogen and helium such that the mean molecular mass is $\\mu = 2.3\\,m_{\\mathrm{H}}$, where $m_{\\mathrm{H}}$ is the mass of a hydrogen atom. The atmospheric temperature is $T = 1500\\,\\mathrm{K}$. Take Jupiter’s mass as $M_{\\mathrm{J}} = 1.89813 \\times 10^{27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$, Jupiter’s radius as $R_{\\mathrm{J}} = 7.1492 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, the Newtonian gravitational constant as $G = 6.67430 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{m^{3}\\,kg^{-1}\\,s^{-2}}$, the Boltzmann constant as $k_{B} = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}$, and the mass of a hydrogen atom as $m_{\\mathrm{H}} = 1.6735575 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$. The host star’s radius is $R_{\\star} = 1.10\\,R_{\\odot}$, where the solar radius is $R_{\\odot} = 6.957 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{m}$. Assume that an optically thick spectral feature in transmission increases the planet’s effective occulting radius by $N$ atmospheric scale heights relative to the local continuum, with $N = 5$ treated as known without uncertainty. Assume the star’s radius $R_{\\star}$ and $N$ are known exactly for the purposes of uncertainty propagation.\n\nStarting from Newton’s law of gravitation, hydrostatic equilibrium, and the ideal gas equation of state, do the following:\n\n- Compute the planet’s surface gravitational acceleration $g$ as $g = G M_{p} / R_{p}^{2}$, and report its numerical value in $\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}$, rounded to four significant figures.\n\n- Derive the atmospheric scale height $H$ from first principles and compute its numerical value in $\\mathrm{km}$, rounding to four significant figures.\n\n- Using the small-change approximation for transit depth in the limit $N H \\ll R_{p}$, express the transmission spectral feature amplitude $\\Delta D$ (the difference between line and continuum transit depths) in terms of $M_{p}$, $R_{p}$, $T$, $\\mu$, $G$, $k_{B}$, $N$, and $R_{\\star}$. Then, assuming independent fractional uncertainties in $M_{p}$ and $R_{p}$ only, with $\\sigma_{M}/M_{p} = 0.05$ and $\\sigma_{R}/R_{p} = 0.03$, propagate these uncertainties to obtain the fractional uncertainty $\\sigma_{\\Delta D}/\\Delta D$.\n\nExpress the final answer for the fractional uncertainty $\\sigma_{\\Delta D}/\\Delta D$ as a single decimal number, rounded to three significant figures. Do not use a percent sign. All intermediate derivations must use the specified physical laws and definitions; avoid empirical “shortcut” formulas that are not derived from those bases.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It is a valid problem in atmospheric physics and exoplanet characterization. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a four-part solution: computation of the planet's surface gravity $g$, derivation and computation of the atmospheric scale height $H$, derivation of the spectral feature amplitude $\\Delta D$, and propagation of uncertainties to find the fractional uncertainty in $\\Delta D$.\n\nFirst, we compute the planet's mass $M_p$ and radius $R_p$ in SI units using the provided data:\n$M_p = 1.00 \\times M_{\\mathrm{J}} = 1.00 \\times (1.89813 \\times 10^{27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}) = 1.89813 \\times 10^{27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\n$R_p = 1.20 \\times R_{\\mathrm{J}} = 1.20 \\times (7.1492 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{m}) = 8.57904 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nThe surface gravitational acceleration $g$ is given by Newton's law of universal gravitation:\n$$g = \\frac{G M_p}{R_p^2}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values for the gravitational constant $G$, planetary mass $M_p$, and planetary radius $R_p$:\n$$g = \\frac{(6.67430 \\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{m^{3}\\,kg^{-1}\\,s^{-2}}) (1.89813 \\times 10^{27}\\,\\mathrm{kg})}{(8.57904 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2}$$\n$$g \\approx 17.1950\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we get $g = 17.20\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}$.\n\nSecond, we derive the atmospheric scale height $H$. The derivation starts from the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium, which balances the pressure gradient force and the gravitational force on a fluid element:\n$$\\frac{dP}{dz} = -\\rho g$$\nwhere $P$ is the pressure, $z$ is the altitude, $\\rho$ is the density, and $g$ is the gravitational acceleration (assumed constant over the atmospheric region of interest). The atmosphere is modeled as an ideal gas, obeying the equation of state:\n$$P = \\frac{\\rho k_B T}{\\mu}$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the temperature (assumed isothermal), and $\\mu$ is the mean molecular mass. We can express the density $\\rho$ as:\n$$\\rho = \\frac{P \\mu}{k_B T}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\rho$ into the hydrostatic equilibrium equation gives:\n$$\\frac{dP}{dz} = - \\left( \\frac{P \\mu}{k_B T} \\right) g$$\nThis is a separable first-order differential equation for pressure as a function of altitude:\n$$\\frac{1}{P} dP = -\\frac{\\mu g}{k_B T} dz$$\nIntegrating this equation from a reference altitude $z=0$ (where pressure is $P_0$) to an altitude $z$ (where pressure is $P(z)$) yields:\n$$\\int_{P_0}^{P(z)} \\frac{dP'}{P'} = -\\int_0^z \\frac{\\mu g}{k_B T} dz'$$\nSince $\\mu$, $g$, $k_B$, and $T$ are all treated as constants, the integral becomes:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{P(z)}{P_0}\\right) = -\\frac{\\mu g}{k_B T} z$$\nThis can be written in exponential form as $P(z) = P_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\mu g}{k_B T} z\\right)$. By definition, the pressure drops by a factor of $1/e$ over a characteristic distance called the scale height, $H$. Thus, we identify the scale height as:\n$$H = \\frac{k_B T}{\\mu g}$$\nTo compute the numerical value of $H$, we first find the mean molecular mass $\\mu$:\n$\\mu = 2.3 \\times m_{\\mathrm{H}} = 2.3 \\times (1.6735575 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}) = 3.84918225 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$.\nNow, we substitute the values for $k_B$, $T$, $\\mu$, and the unrounded value of $g$ into the expression for $H$:\n$$H = \\frac{(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}) (1500\\,\\mathrm{K})}{(3.84918225 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}) (17.1950\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}})} \\approx 3.12895 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{m}$$\nConverting to kilometers and rounding to four significant figures gives $H = 312.9\\,\\mathrm{km}$.\n\nThird, we derive the transmission spectral feature amplitude $\\Delta D$. The transit depth $D$ is the ratio of the projected area of the occulting body to the projected area of the star, $D = (R_{occ}/R_{\\star})^2$. In the continuum, the occulting radius is the planet's radius $R_p$, so $D_{cont} = (R_p/R_{\\star})^2$. In an optically thick spectral line, the atmosphere becomes opaque, increasing the effective occulting radius by $N$ scale heights to $R_{line} = R_p + NH$. The depth in the line is $D_{line} = ((R_p + NH)/R_{\\star})^2$. The spectral feature amplitude $\\Delta D$ is the difference:\n$$\\Delta D = D_{line} - D_{cont} = \\frac{(R_p + NH)^2}{R_{\\star}^2} - \\frac{R_p^2}{R_{\\star}^2} = \\frac{(R_p^2 + 2 R_p NH + (NH)^2) - R_p^2}{R_{\\star}^2}$$\n$$\\Delta D = \\frac{2 R_p NH + (NH)^2}{R_{\\star}^2}$$\nUsing the small-change approximation $NH \\ll R_p$, the term $(NH)^2$ is negligible compared to $2 R_p NH$, so we have:\n$$\\Delta D \\approx \\frac{2 R_p NH}{R_{\\star}^2}$$\nNow we substitute the expressions for $H = k_B T / (\\mu g)$ and $g = G M_p / R_p^2$. First we express $H$ in terms of the primary parameters:\n$$H = \\frac{k_B T}{\\mu (G M_p / R_p^2)} = \\frac{k_B T R_p^2}{G \\mu M_p}$$\nSubstituting this into the approximate expression for $\\Delta D$:\n$$\\Delta D \\approx \\frac{2 R_p N}{R_{\\star}^2} \\left( \\frac{k_B T R_p^2}{G \\mu M_p} \\right) = \\frac{2 N k_B T R_p^3}{G \\mu M_p R_{\\star}^2}$$\nThis is the desired expression for $\\Delta D$ in terms of the specified variables.\n\nFinally, we propagate the uncertainties to find the fractional uncertainty $\\sigma_{\\Delta D}/\\Delta D$. The expression for $\\Delta D$ can be written as $\\Delta D \\propto M_p^{-1} R_p^3$, since all other variables ($N$, $k_B$, $T$, $G$, $\\mu$, $R_{\\star}$) are assumed to have no uncertainty. For a function $f(x, y) = C x^a y^b$, the standard formula for propagation of independent fractional uncertainties is:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_f}{f}\\right)^2 = \\left(a \\frac{\\sigma_x}{x}\\right)^2 + \\left(b \\frac{\\sigma_y}{y}\\right)^2$$\nFor our function $\\Delta D(M_p, R_p)$, we have $x = R_p$ with exponent $a=3$, and $y=M_p$ with exponent $b=-1$. The fractional uncertainty in $\\Delta D$ is therefore given by:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{\\Delta D}}{\\Delta D}\\right)^2 = \\left(3 \\frac{\\sigma_{R}}{R_p}\\right)^2 + \\left(-1 \\frac{\\sigma_{M}}{M_p}\\right)^2 = 9\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{R}}{R_p}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{M}}{M_p}\\right)^2$$\nWe are given the fractional uncertainties $\\sigma_{M}/M_{p} = 0.05$ and $\\sigma_{R}/R_{p} = 0.03$. Substituting these values:\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{\\Delta D}}{\\Delta D}\\right)^2 = 9(0.03)^2 + (0.05)^2$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{\\Delta D}}{\\Delta D}\\right)^2 = 9(0.0009) + 0.0025 = 0.0081 + 0.0025 = 0.0106$$\nTaking the square root gives the fractional uncertainty:\n$$\\frac{\\sigma_{\\Delta D}}{\\Delta D} = \\sqrt{0.0106} \\approx 0.102956$$\nRounding this final result to three significant figures, we obtain $0.103$.",

The validation process confirms the problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information. We proceed with the solution by following the structured steps provided.\n\n**1. Derivation of Emission Photospheric Pressure $P_{\\mathrm{em}}(\\lambda)$**\n\nWe begin with the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium for a plane-parallel atmosphere under constant gravity $g$:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{dz} = -\\rho g $$\nwhere $P$ is the pressure, $\\rho$ is the density, and $z$ is the vertical coordinate. The atmosphere is assumed to be an ideal gas, so its equation of state is:\n$$ P = \\frac{\\rho k_B T}{\\bar{m}} $$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the temperature (assumed isothermal), and $\\bar{m}$ is the mean molecular mass, given by $\\bar{m} = \\mu m_{H}$. We can express density in terms of pressure:\n$$ \\rho = \\frac{P \\bar{m}}{k_B T} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $\\rho$ into the hydrostatic equilibrium equation yields:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{dz} = -P \\frac{g \\bar{m}}{k_B T} $$\nWe define the atmospheric scale height $H$ as $H = \\frac{k_B T}{g \\bar{m}}$. The equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{P} = -\\frac{1}{H} dz $$\nThe vertical optical depth $\\tau$ is defined from the top of the atmosphere downwards. Its differential form is $d\\tau = -\\kappa \\rho dz$, where $\\kappa$ is the mass opacity. We seek the pressure $P$ at which the optical depth, integrated from the top of the atmosphere (where $P=0$), reaches a certain value. We can relate $d\\tau$ and $dP$ using the hydrostatic equilibrium equation $dz = -dP/(\\rho g)$:\n$$ d\\tau = -\\kappa \\rho \\left( -\\frac{dP}{\\rho g} \\right) = \\frac{\\kappa}{g} dP $$\nIntegrating from the top of the atmosphere ($P'=0$, $\\tau'=0$) to a level with pressure $P$ and optical depth $\\tau(P)$:\n$$ \\int_0^{\\tau(P)} d\\tau' = \\int_0^P \\frac{\\kappa_{\\mathrm{em}}(\\lambda)}{g} dP' $$\nAssuming $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{em}}(\\lambda)$ and $g$ are constant with pressure, the integration gives:\n$$ \\tau(P) = \\frac{\\kappa_{\\mathrm{em}}(\\lambda) P}{g} $$\nThe emission photosphere is defined as the level where the vertical optical depth from space is $\\tau_{\\mathrm{em}} = 2/3$. The pressure at this level is $P_{\\mathrm{em}}(\\lambda)$:\n$$ \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{\\kappa_{\\mathrm{em}}(\\lambda) P_{\\mathrm{em}}(\\lambda)}{g} $$\nSolving for $P_{\\mathrm{em}}(\\lambda)$ gives the desired expression:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{em}}(\\lambda) = \\frac{2g}{3\\kappa_{\\mathrm{em}}(\\lambda)} $$\n\n**2. Derivation of Transmission Photospheric Pressure $P_{\\mathrm{tr}}(\\lambda)$**\n\nIn transmission geometry, we consider the slant optical depth $\\tau_{\\mathrm{tr,slant}}$ along a ray (chord) that is tangent to a level with pressure $P_0$ at a radius $r_0 = R_p + z_0$. The slant optical depth is given by the integral along the path $s$:\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{tr,slant}} = \\int_{\\text{path}} \\kappa_{\\mathrm{tr}}(\\lambda) \\rho(s) ds $$\nLet $x$ be the coordinate along the path, with $x=0$ at the tangent point. Using the Pythagorean theorem, the radial distance $r$ at a point $x$ is $r(x) = \\sqrt{r_0^2 + x^2}$. For a thin atmosphere, we use the local parabolic approximation for the altitude $z_x$ above the tangent point altitude $z_0$:\n$$ r(x) = r_0\\sqrt{1+\\frac{x^2}{r_0^2}} \\approx r_0\\left(1 + \\frac{x^2}{2r_0^2}\\right) = r_0 + \\frac{x^2}{2r_0} $$\nThe height difference is $z(x)-z_0 = r(x)-r_0 \\approx \\frac{x^2}{2r_0}$. Approximating $r_0 \\approx R_p$ for a path through the upper atmosphere gives $z(x)-z_0 \\approx \\frac{x^2}{2R_p}$.\nThe density profile in an isothermal atmosphere is $\\rho(z) = \\rho_0 \\exp(-(z-z_0)/H)$, where $\\rho_0$ is the density at the tangent point. Along the path, the density is:\n$$ \\rho(x) \\approx \\rho_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2R_p H}\\right) $$\nThe slant optical depth integral becomes (approximating $ds \\approx dx$):\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{tr,slant}}(P_0) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\kappa_{\\mathrm{tr}}(\\lambda) \\rho_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2R_p H}\\right) dx $$\nThis is a standard Gaussian integral of the form $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-ax^2}dx = \\sqrt{\\pi/a}$, with $a = 1/(2R_p H)$.\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{tr,slant}}(P_0) = \\kappa_{\\mathrm{tr}}(\\lambda) \\rho_0 \\sqrt{2\\pi R_p H} $$\nWe relate the tangent point density $\\rho_0$ to the tangent pressure $P_0$ using $\\rho_0 = P_0/(gH)$:\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{tr,slant}}(P_0) = \\kappa_{\\mathrm{tr}}(\\lambda) \\frac{P_0}{gH} \\sqrt{2\\pi R_p H} = \\frac{\\kappa_{\\mathrm{tr}}(\\lambda) P_0}{g} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi R_p}{H}} $$\nThe transmission photosphere is defined by the criterion that the slant optical depth is unity, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{tr,slant}} = 1$. The pressure at this level is $P_{\\mathrm{tr}}(\\lambda)$:\n$$ 1 = \\frac{\\kappa_{\\mathrm{tr}}(\\lambda) P_{\\mathrm{tr}}(\\lambda)}{g} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi R_p}{H}} $$\nSolving for $P_{\\mathrm{tr}}(\\lambda)$ yields:\n$$ P_{\\mathrm{tr}}(\\lambda) = \\frac{g}{\\kappa_{\\mathrm{tr}}(\\lambda) \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi R_p}{H}}} $$\n\n**3.

The goal is to derive, implement, and evaluate a physically consistent model using conservation principles and radiative relaxation assumptions, and then to compute observable quantities from the modeled temperature field.\n\nFundamental base and assumptions to be used:\n- The planet is tidally locked, so the substellar point is fixed at longitude $\\lambda = 0$.\n- Consider a single shallow, dynamically active layer representing the photosphere, described by the Shallow-Water (SW) framework. Use mass and momentum conservation concepts to justify a steady-state zonal advective balance of temperature against radiative relaxation (Newtonian cooling).\n- Assume a zonal wind speed $u$ that is uniform along the equator (eastward if $u  0$, westward if $u  0$).\n- The radiative relaxation toward an equilibrium temperature pattern $T_{\\mathrm{eq}}(\\lambda)$ is characterized by a radiative timescale $\\tau_{\\mathrm{rad}}$.\n- Use a sinusoidal day-night equilibrium forcing at the equator, $T_{\\mathrm{eq}}(\\lambda) = T_0 + A \\cos \\lambda$, where $T_0$ is a mean temperature and $A$ is the day-night equilibrium amplitude at the equator; this is a standard idealization consistent with fixed stellar heating on the day side ($\\lambda \\approx 0$).\n- For the equatorial longitudinal temperature $T(\\lambda)$ at steady state, derive the governing ordinary differential equation by balancing zonal advection with radiative relaxation using the arc-length coordinate $s = R \\lambda$, where $R$ is the planetary radius. You must obtain a periodic solution consistent with the $2\\pi$ periodic domain in $\\lambda$.\n- For comparability with observations, approximate the thermal emission phase curve by linearizing the emission around $T_0$ and integrating the longitudinal brightness over the visible hemisphere using a simple one-dimensional visible weighting kernel proportional to $\\cos x$ for viewing angle $x \\in [-\\pi/2,\\pi/2]$.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the established principles of planetary atmospheric dynamics, well-posed with a clear mathematical structure leading to a unique solution, and entirely objective. The setup is complete, consistent, and uses physically plausible parameters. We proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Governing Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)\n\nWe are tasked with modeling the equatorial temperature $T(\\lambda)$ of a tidally locked hot Jupiter under the influence of zonal advection and radiative relaxation. The fundamental principle is the conservation of thermal energy for a fluid parcel in a steady state.\n\nThe rate of change of temperature for a fluid parcel moving with velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ is given by the material derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{DT}{dt} = \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla T\n$$\nIn this model, we assume a steady state, so the partial time derivative $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = 0$. The flow is purely zonal (along the equator) with a uniform speed $u$, so $\\mathbf{v} = u \\mathbf{\\hat{\\lambda}}$, where $\\mathbf{\\hat{\\lambda}}$ is the unit vector in the longitudinal direction. The gradient operator in spherical coordinates along the equator simplifies to $\\nabla = \\frac{1}{R} \\frac{d}{d\\lambda} \\mathbf{\\hat{\\lambda}}$, where $R$ is the planetary radius and $\\lambda$ is the longitude in radians.\n\nThus, the advective term, which represents the change in temperature due to the parcel moving to a new location, is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla T = u \\left( \\frac{1}{R} \\frac{dT}{d\\lambda} \\right) = \\frac{u}{R} \\frac{dT}{d\\lambda}\n$$\n\nThis advective change is balanced by radiative relaxation, modeled as Newtonian cooling. This process drives the local temperature $T(\\lambda)$ towards a radiative equilibrium temperature $T_{\\mathrm{eq}}(\\lambda)$ over a characteristic radiative timescale $\\tau_{\\mathrm{rad}}$. The rate of change due to radiation is:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{dT}{dt}\\right)_{\\mathrm{rad}} = -\\frac{T(\\lambda) - T_{\\mathrm{eq}}(\\lambda)}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rad}}}\n$$\n\nIn a steady state, the advective cooling/heating must balance the radiative heating/cooling:\n$$\n\\frac{DT}{dt} = \\frac{u}{R} \\frac{dT}{d\\lambda} = -\\frac{T(\\lambda) - T_{\\mathrm{eq}}(\\lambda)}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rad}}}\n$$\n\nRearranging this equation gives the governing linear first-order ordinary differential equation for $T(\\lambda)$:\n$$\n\\frac{u \\tau_{\\mathrm{rad}}}{R} \\frac{dT}{d\\lambda} + T(\\lambda) = T_{\\mathrm{eq}}(\\lambda)\n$$\nWe define a non-dimensional parameter $\\alpha$, which represents the ratio of the advective transport timescale over the planetary circumference to the radiative timescale. A more direct interpretation is the ratio of the radiative time to the advective time over one radian, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{rad}} / (R/u)$.\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{u \\tau_{\\mathrm{rad}}}{R}\n$$\nThe ODE can then be written more compactly as:\n$$\n\\alpha \\frac{dT}{d\\lambda} + T(\\lambda) = T_{\\mathrm{eq}}(\\lambda)\n$$\n\n### Part 2: Solution of the ODE\n\nThe radiative equilibrium forcing is given as a sinusoidal function of longitude:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{eq}}(\\lambda) = T_0 + A \\cos \\lambda\n$$\nwhere $T_0$ is the mean equilibrium temperature and $A$ is the amplitude of the day-night temperature contrast. Substituting this into the ODE yields:\n$$\n\\alpha \\frac{dT}{d\\lambda} + T(\\lambda) = T_0 + A \\cos \\lambda\n$$\nWe seek a periodic solution on the domain $\\lambda \\in [-\\pi, \\pi]$. Given the linear nature of the equation and the sinusoidal forcing, we can posit a solution of the form:\n$$\nT(\\lambda) = T_{\\text{mean}} + C \\cos \\lambda + D \\sin \\lambda\n$$\nThe derivative is $\\frac{dT}{d\\lambda} = -C \\sin \\lambda + D \\cos \\lambda$. Substituting the solution and its derivative into the ODE:\n$$\n\\alpha(-C \\sin \\lambda + D \\cos \\lambda) + (T_{\\text{mean}} + C \\cos \\lambda + D \\sin \\lambda) = T_0 + A \\cos \\lambda\n$$\nWe collect terms based on their functional dependence on $\\lambda$:\n$$\nT_{\\text{mean}} + (C + \\alpha D)\\cos \\lambda + (D - \\alpha C)\\sin \\lambda = T_0 + A \\cos \\lambda\n$$\nFor this equality to hold for all $\\lambda$, the coefficients of the constant, $\\cos \\lambda$, and $\\sin \\lambda$ terms must match on both sides:\n1. Constant terms: $T_{\\text{mean}} = T_0$\n2. $\\sin \\lambda$ terms: $D - \\alpha C = 0 \\implies D = \\alpha C$\n3. $\\cos \\lambda$ terms: $C + \\alpha D = A$\n\nSubstituting $D = \\alpha C$ into the third equation gives:\n$$\nC + \\alpha(\\alpha C) = A \\implies C(1 + \\alpha^2) = A \\implies C = \\frac{A}{1+\\alpha^2}\n$$\nAnd consequently:\n$$\nD = \\frac{\\alpha A}{1+\\alpha^2}\n$$\nThe full solution for the temperature profile is:\n$$\nT(\\lambda) = T_0 + \\left(\\frac{A}{1+\\alpha^2}\\right) \\cos \\lambda + \\left(\\frac{\\alpha A}{1+\\alpha^2}\\right) \\sin \\lambda\n$$\nThis solution represents a sinusoidal temperature pattern with its peak (the \"hotspot\") shifted longitudinally relative to the substellar point ($\\lambda=0$). The eastward shift corresponds to $\\alpha  0$ (eastward wind).\n\n### Part 3: Derivation of Observable Quantities\n\nThe observed flux $F(\\psi)$ at an orbital phase angle $\\psi$ is given by the integral of the temperature over the visible hemisphere, weighted by a $\\cos x$ kernel:\n$$\nF(\\psi) \\propto \\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2} T(\\psi + x)\\,\\cos x\\,dx\n$$\nWe substitute our solution for $T(\\lambda)$, with $\\lambda = \\psi+x$:\n$$\nT(\\psi+x) = T_0 + C \\cos(\\psi+x) + D \\sin(\\psi+x)\n$$\nThe integral becomes:\n$$\nF(\\psi) \\propto \\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2} [T_0 + C(\\cos\\psi\\cos x - \\sin\\psi\\sin x) + D(\\sin\\psi\\cos x + \\cos\\psi\\sin x)] \\cos x \\,dx\n$$\nWe evaluate the integral term-by-term, using the standard definite integrals:\n- $\\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2} \\cos x \\,dx = [\\sin x]_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2} = 2$\n- $\\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2} \\cos^2 x \\,dx = [\\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{\\sin(2x)}{4}]_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$\n- $\\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2} \\sin x \\cos x \\,dx = [\\frac{\\sin^2 x}{2}]_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2} = 0$\n\nApplying these results:\n$$\nF(\\psi) \\propto T_0(2) + C\\cos\\psi(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) - C\\sin\\psi(0) + D\\sin\\psi(\\frac{\\pi}{2}) + D\\cos\\psi(0)\n$$\n$$\nF(\\psi) \\propto 2T_0 + \\frac{\\pi}{2}(C \\cos\\psi + D \\sin\\psi)\n$$\nWe want to express this in the form $F(\\psi) = F_0 + \\mathcal{R}\\cos(\\psi - \\varphi)$.\nLet the proportionality constant be $k$. Then $F(\\psi) = k [2T_0 + \\frac{\\pi}{2}(C \\cos\\psi + D \\sin\\psi)]$.\nThe mean flux is $F_0 = 2kT_0$.\nThe variable part is $\\mathcal{R}\\cos(\\psi-\\varphi) = k\\frac{\\pi}{2}(C \\cos\\psi + D \\sin\\psi)$.\nTo find $\\varphi$ and the amplitude, we rewrite $C\\cos\\psi + D\\sin\\psi$ as $\\sqrt{C^2+D^2}\\cos(\\psi - \\arctan(D/C))$.\nThe phase curve offset $\\varphi$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\varphi = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{D}{C}\\right) = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\alpha A/(1+\\alpha^2)}{A/(1+\\alpha^2)}\\right) = \\arctan(\\alpha)\n$$\nThe amplitude of the variable part is $\\mathcal{R} = k\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\sqrt{C^2+D^2}$.\nThe fractional amplitude $\\mathcal{R}/F_0$ is independent of the unknown constant $k$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathcal{R}}{F_0} = \\frac{k\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\sqrt{C^2+D^2}}{2kT_0} = \\frac{\\pi}{4T_0}\\sqrt{C^2+D^2}\n$$\nWe calculate $\\sqrt{C^2+D^2}$:\n$$\n\\sqrt{C^2+D^2} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{A}{1+\\alpha^2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\alpha A}{1+\\alpha^2}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{A^2(1+\\alpha^2)}{(1+\\alpha^2)^2}} = \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{1+\\alpha^2}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the fractional amplitude expression gives the final result:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathcal{R}}{F_0} = \\frac{\\pi A}{4 T_0 \\sqrt{1+\\alpha^2}}\n$$\n\n### Summary of Formulas for Implementation\n\nFor each test case with parameters $(R, u, \\tau_{\\mathrm{rad}}, T_0, A)$:\n1.
