Derive the Escape Speed ($v_{\\text{esc}}$)**\n\nThe escape speed is the minimum initial speed a particle at radius $r_e$ needs to escape the planet's gravitational pull.

Form the Ratio $R$ and Interpret**\n\nThe dimensionless ratio $R$ is defined as the escape speed divided by the most probable thermal speed:\n$$ R = \\frac{v_{\\text{esc}}}{v_p} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{2 G M_p}{r_e}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2 k_B T_e}{m_{\\mathrm{H}}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{G M_p m_{\\mathrm{H}}}{r_e k_B T_e}} $$\nThis ratio is the square root of the Jeans parameter, $\\lambda$. A small value of $R$ (typically $R \\lesssim 3$) indicates that the thermal energy is comparable to the gravitational binding energy, and the atmosphere will escape hydrodynamically (blow-off). A large value ($R \\gtrsim 10$) signifies that escape is dominated by the slow, evaporative Jeans escape mechanism.\n\n**4.
