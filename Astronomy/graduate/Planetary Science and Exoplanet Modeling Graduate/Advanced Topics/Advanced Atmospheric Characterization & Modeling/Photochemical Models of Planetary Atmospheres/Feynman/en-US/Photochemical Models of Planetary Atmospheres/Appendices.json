            "introduction": "In photochemical models, it is crucial to distinguish between a species' relative abundance, described by its mixing ratio, and its absolute concentration, given by its number density. While mixing ratios are often conserved during atmospheric transport, chemical reaction rates are fundamentally governed by the collision frequency of molecules, which depends on their number densities. This practice  bridges this conceptual gap by exploring the formal relationship between these two descriptions. By working through this exercise, you will gain a core understanding of how the actual volumetric rate of a bimolecular reaction changes dramatically with ambient pressure, even when mixing ratios remain constant.",

            "problem": "A temperate exoplanet has a middle atmosphere where a bimolecular reaction $\\mathrm{NO} + \\mathrm{O}_3 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{NO}_2 + \\mathrm{O}_2$ proceeds. Assume hydrostatic equilibrium and the Ideal Gas Law, and treat the atmosphere at fixed altitude as isothermal. Let the total air number density be $N$, the partial number densities be $n_i$, and the mixing ratios be $X_i$ defined by $X_i = n_i / N$. The volumetric reaction rate for the bimolecular process is governed by the law of mass action. The Boltzmann constant is $k_B$.\n\nAt this altitude, the temperature is $T = 220 \\,\\mathrm{K}$. Consider two steady states with pressures $p_1 = 100 \\,\\mathrm{hPa}$ and $p_2 = 30 \\,\\mathrm{hPa}$, respectively. The bimolecular rate coefficient for $\\mathrm{NO} + \\mathrm{O}_3$ at this temperature is $k(T) = 1.5 \\times 10^{-14} \\,\\mathrm{cm^3 \\, molecule^{-1} \\, s^{-1}}$. The background mixing ratios are $X_{\\mathrm{NO}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-9}$ and $X_{\\mathrm{O}_3} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-6}$, and may be treated as constant between the two pressure states.\n\nStarting from the Ideal Gas Law $N = p/(k_B T)$ and the law of mass action for bimolecular reactions, derive the relation between number-density-based and mixing-ratio-based formulations of the reaction rate. Define the mixing-ratio-form reaction coefficient $\\kappa(T,p)$ by writing the chemical tendency in the form $\\frac{dX_{\\mathrm{NO}}}{dt} = -\\kappa(T,p)\\,X_{\\mathrm{NO}}\\,X_{\\mathrm{O}_3}$, and express $\\kappa(T,p)$ in terms of $k(T)$, $p$, $T$, and $k_B$. Then, compute the ratio $r$ of the volumetric reaction rates per unit volume at $p_2$ to that at $p_1$ for the given $T$ and mixing ratios, keeping $k(T)$ fixed.\n\nExpress the final ratio $r$ as a dimensionless decimal number and round your answer to four significant figures. Report only the ratio $r$.",
            "solution": "The problem requires us to first derive a relationship between the number-density-based and mixing-ratio-based formulations for a bimolecular reaction rate and then to compute the ratio of volumetric reaction rates at two different pressures.\n\nThe bimolecular reaction is given by $\\mathrm{NO} + \\mathrm{O}_3 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{NO}_2 + \\mathrm{O}_2$.\nThe law of mass action states that the volumetric rate of this reaction, defined as the rate of consumption of a reactant per unit volume, is proportional to the product of the number densities of the reactants. For the reactant $\\mathrm{NO}$, its number density, $n_{\\mathrm{NO}}$, changes with time $t$ according to:\n$$\n\\frac{dn_{\\mathrm{NO}}}{dt} = -k(T) \\, n_{\\mathrm{NO}} \\, n_{\\mathrm{O}_3}\n$$\nwhere $k(T)$ is the temperature-dependent bimolecular rate coefficient, and $n_{\\mathrm{NO}}$ and $n_{\\mathrm{O}_3}$ are the number densities of $\\mathrm{NO}$ and $\\mathrm{O}_3$, respectively.\n\nThe mixing ratio of a species $i$, $X_i$, is defined as the ratio of its partial number density $n_i$ to the total air number density $N$:\n$$\nX_i = \\frac{n_i}{N} \\quad \\implies \\quad n_i = X_i N\n$$\nWe wish to express the chemical tendency in terms of mixing ratios. The rate of change of the mixing ratio $X_{\\mathrm{NO}}$ due to chemistry is found by applying the chain rule to its definition:\n$$\n\\frac{dX_{\\mathrm{NO}}}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{n_{\\mathrm{NO}}}{N}\\right) = \\frac{1}{N}\\frac{dn_{\\mathrm{NO}}}{dt} - \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{NO}}}{N^2}\\frac{dN}{dt}\n$$\nThe chemical tendency for the mixing ratio is typically defined assuming the background air density $N$ is constant with respect to short-timescale chemical changes, or that dynamical effects leading to changes in $N$ are treated separately. For a reaction where the total number of molecules is conserved, as is the case here ($1+1 \\rightarrow 1+1$), the chemical change itself does not alter $N$. Thus, we consider only the first term for the chemical tendency:\n$$\n\\frac{dX_{\\mathrm{NO}}}{dt} = \\frac{1}{N}\\frac{dn_{\\mathrm{NO}}}{dt}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\frac{dn_{\\mathrm{NO}}}{dt}$ from the law of mass action:\n$$\n\\frac{dX_{\\mathrm{NO}}}{dt} = \\frac{1}{N} \\left(-k(T) \\, n_{\\mathrm{NO}} \\, n_{\\mathrm{O}_3}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we replace the number densities $n_{\\mathrm{NO}}$ and $n_{\\mathrm{O}_3}$ with their mixing ratio equivalents, $n_{\\mathrm{NO}} = X_{\\mathrm{NO}} N$ and $n_{\\mathrm{O}_3} = X_{\\mathrm{O}_3} N$:\n$$\n\\frac{dX_{\\mathrm{NO}}}{dt} = -\\frac{k(T)}{N} (X_{\\mathrm{NO}} N) (X_{\\mathrm{O}_3} N) = -k(T) N X_{\\mathrm{NO}} X_{\\mathrm{O}_3}\n$$\nThe problem defines a mixing-ratio-form reaction coefficient $\\kappa(T,p)$ through the relation:\n$$\n\\frac{dX_{\\mathrm{NO}}}{dt} = -\\kappa(T,p) X_{\\mathrm{NO}} X_{\\mathrm{O}_3}\n$$\nBy comparing this definition with our derived expression, we can identify $\\kappa(T,p)$:\n$$\n\\kappa(T,p) = k(T) N\n$$\nThe problem provides the Ideal Gas Law in the form $N = \\frac{p}{k_B T}$, where $p$ is the pressure, $T$ is the temperature, and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. Substituting this for $N$, we obtain the expression for $\\kappa(T,p)$ in terms of the specified variables:\n$$\n\\kappa(T,p) = k(T) \\frac{p}{k_B T}\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we need to compute the ratio $r$ of the volumetric reaction rates at two different pressure states, $p_2 = 30 \\,\\mathrm{hPa}$ and $p_1 = 100 \\,\\mathrm{hPa}$. The volumetric reaction rate, which we denote as $R_{vol}$, is the magnitude of the rate of change of number density, i.e., how many reactions occur per unit volume per unit time.\n$$\nR_{vol} = k(T) \\, n_{\\mathrm{NO}} \\, n_{\\mathrm{O}_3}\n$$\nThe ratio $r$ is:\n$$\nr = \\frac{R_{vol, 2}}{R_{vol, 1}} = \\frac{k(T_2) \\, n_{\\mathrm{NO},2} \\, n_{\\mathrm{O}_3,2}}{k(T_1) \\, n_{\\mathrm{NO},1} \\, n_{\\mathrm{O}_3,1}}\n$$\nThe problem states that the temperature is constant, $T_1 = T_2 = T = 220 \\,\\mathrm{K}$. Therefore, the rate coefficient $k(T)$ is the same for both states and cancels out.\n$$\nr = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{NO},2} \\, n_{\\mathrm{O}_3,2}}{n_{\\mathrm{NO},1} \\, n_{\\mathrm{O}_3,1}}\n$$\nWe express the number densities in terms of mixing ratios and total number density: $n_i = X_i N$.\n$$\nr = \\frac{(X_{\\mathrm{NO},2} N_2) (X_{\\mathrm{O}_3,2} N_2)}{(X_{\\mathrm{NO},1} N_1) (X_{\\mathrm{O}_3,1} N_1)} = \\frac{X_{\\mathrm{NO},2} X_{\\mathrm{O}_3,2} N_2^2}{X_{\\mathrm{NO},1} X_{\\mathrm{O}_3,1} N_1^2}\n$$\nThe problem states that the mixing ratios $X_{\\mathrm{NO}}$ and $X_{\\mathrm{O}_3}$ are constant between the two states. Thus, $X_{\\mathrm{NO},1} = X_{\\mathrm{NO},2}$ and $X_{\\mathrm{O}_3,1} = X_{\\mathrm{O}_3,2}$. These terms cancel from the ratio.\n$$\nr = \\frac{N_2^2}{N_1^2} = \\left(\\frac{N_2}{N_1}\\right)^2\n$$\nUsing the Ideal Gas Law, $N = \\frac{p}{k_B T}$, we find the ratio of total number densities:\n$$\n\\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \\frac{p_2 / (k_B T)}{p_1 / (k_B T)} = \\frac{p_2}{p_1}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $r$:\n$$\nr = \\left(\\frac{p_2}{p_1}\\right)^2\n$$\nFinally, we substitute the given pressure values, $p_1 = 100 \\,\\mathrm{hPa}$ and $p_2 = 30 \\,\\mathrm{hPa}$. The units of pressure cancel out.\n$$\nr = \\left(\\frac{30}{100}\\right)^2 = (0.3)^2 = 0.09\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a dimensionless decimal number rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nr = 0.09000\n$$",

            "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional, plane-parallel atmospheric layer of a hydrogen-dominated exoplanet orbiting a cool star. A short-lived radical species $X$ is produced exclusively by photolysis of a precursor species $A$ and is lost exclusively by a bimolecular reaction with a background reactant $B$. The continuity equation for species $X$ in a homogeneous layer (neglecting transport and other sources/sinks) is given by the time rate of change of the number density $n_X$ equal to production minus loss. The production rate is defined by $P_X = J_A n_A$, where $J_A$ is the photolysis frequency of $A$ and $n_A$ is the number density of $A$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and self-contained. It is based on fundamental principles of atmospheric chemistry and physics, including the continuity equation for a chemical species, photolysis kinetics, bimolecular reaction kinetics, the Ideal Gas Law, and radiative transfer via the Beer–Lambert law. All constants and boundary conditions necessary for a unique solution are provided, and their values are physically realistic for the specified environment of a hydrogen-dominated exoplanet atmosphere. There are no internal contradictions or ambiguities. The problem is valid and can be solved as stated.\n\nThe analysis proceeds in two parts: first, the derivation of symbolic expressions for the steady-state number density $n_X$ and chemical lifetime $\\tau_X$; second, the computation of their numerical values.\n\n**1. Derivation of Symbolic Expressions**\n\nThe time evolution of the number density of species $X$, denoted by $n_X$, is given by the continuity equation, which balances production and loss.\n$$\n\\frac{dn_X}{dt} = P_X - L_X\n$$\nwhere $P_X$ is the production rate and $L_X$ is the loss rate. The problem states that $P_X = J_A n_A$ and $L_X = k_X n_X n_B$.\nSubstituting these into the continuity equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dn_X}{dt} = J_A n_A - k_X n_X n_B\n$$\nAt steady state, the number density of $X$ is constant, so $\\frac{dn_X}{dt} = 0$. This implies that the production and loss rates are equal:\n$$\nP_X = L_X\n$$\n$$\nJ_A n_A = k_X n_X n_B\n$$\nThis equation can be solved for the steady-state number density, $n_X$:\n$$\nn_X = \\frac{J_A n_A}{k_X n_B}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the number densities of species $A$ and $B$ are related to the total number density $n$ via constant mixing ratios, $q_A$ and $q_B$: $n_A = q_A n$ and $n_B = q_B n$. Substituting these into the expression for $n_X$ yields:\n$$\nn_X = \\frac{J_A (q_A n)}{k_X (q_B n)} = \\frac{J_A q_A}{k_X q_B}\n$$\nThis is the symbolic expression for the steady-state number density of $X$.\n\nThe chemical lifetime, $\\tau_X$, of a species is defined as the total number of density of that species divided by its total loss rate, $\\tau_X = \\frac{n_X}{L_X}$. For species $X$, the loss rate is $L_X = k_X n_X n_B$.\n$$\n\\tau_X = \\frac{n_X}{k_X n_X n_B} = \\frac{1}{k_X n_B}\n$$\nThis can also be seen by noting that the loss term $k_X n_X n_B$ can be written as a pseudo-first-order loss process, $L_X = l_X n_X$, where the first-order loss frequency is $l_X = k_X n_B$. The lifetime is the reciprocal of this loss frequency, $\\tau_X = l_X^{-1}$.\n\n**2. Numerical Computation**\n\nTo compute the numerical values of $n_X$ and $\\tau_X$, we first evaluate the intermediate quantities using the given data. We will perform calculations in a consistent set of units. The majority of parameters are provided in centimeter-gram-second (cgs) units or are compatible with them, so we will adopt this system. We must convert pressure $p$ and the Boltzmann constant $k_B$ to cgs units.\n\nGiven parameters:\n- Pressure: $p = 5.00 \\times 10^3$ Pa\n- Temperature: $T = 200$ K\n- Boltzmann constant: $k_B = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}$ J K$^{-1}$\n- Mixing ratio of A: $q_A = 2.00 \\times 10^{-8}$\n- Mixing ratio of B: $q_B = 1.00 \\times 10^{-6}$\n- Actinic flux at top of layer: $F_0 = 5.00 \\times 10^{12}$ photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$\n- Column density of C: $N_C = 1.00 \\times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$\n- Absorption cross section of C: $\\sigma_C = 1.00 \\times 10^{-21}$ cm$^{2}$\n- Absorption cross section of A: $\\sigma_A = 2.00 \\times 10^{-18}$ cm$^2$\n- Photolysis quantum yield of A: $\\phi_A = 1.00$\n- Bimolecular rate coefficient: $k_X = 5.00 \\times 10^{-11}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$\n\nUnit conversions to cgs:\n- $1 \\text{ Pa} = 10 \\text{ dyne cm}^{-2} \\implies p = 5.00 \\times 10^3 \\times 10 = 5.00 \\times 10^4$ dyne cm$^{-2}$.\n- $1 \\text{ J} = 10^7 \\text{ erg} \\implies k_B = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23} \\times 10^7 = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-16}$ erg K$^{-1}$.\n\nFirst, calculate the photolysis frequency $J_A$.

This requires the number density of species $B$, which is $n_B = q_B n$. We must first find the total number density $n$ from the Ideal Gas Law, $n = \\frac{p}{k_B T}$.\n$$\nn = \\frac{5.00 \\times 10^4 \\text{ dyne cm}^{-2}}{(1.380649 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ erg K}^{-1}) \\times (200 \\text{ K})} = \\frac{5.00 \\times 10^4}{2.761298 \\times 10^{-14}} \\text{ cm}^{-3}\n$$\n$$\nn \\approx 1.810752 \\times 10^{18} \\text{ cm}^{-3}\n$$\nNow, we find $n_B$:\n$$\nn_B = q_B n = (1.00 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times (1.810752 \\times 10^{18} \\text{ cm}^{-3}) \\approx 1.810752 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ cm}^{-3}\n$$\nFinally, we calculate the lifetime $\\tau_X$:\n$$\n\\tau_X = \\frac{1}{k_X n_B} = \\frac{1}{(5.00 \\times 10^{-11} \\text{ cm}^3 \\text{s}^{-1}) \\times (1.810752 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ cm}^{-3})} = \\frac{1}{90.5376} \\text{ s}\n$$\n$$\n\\tau_X \\approx 0.0110451 \\text{ s}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $\\tau_X \\approx 1.105 \\times 10^{-2}$ s.\n\nThe steady-state number density is $n_X = 1.472 \\times 10^3$ molecules cm$^{-3}$ and the chemical lifetime is $\\tau_X = 1.105 \\times 10^{-2}$ s.",

For each species $i$, the rate of change is $\\dot{n}_i = \\sum_{j=1}^9 S_{i,j} r_j$. We are asked to express this as $\\dot{\\mathbf{n}} = \\mathcal{P} - \\mathcal{L}$.\n\nWe can decompose the sum for each component $\\dot{n}_i$ into production and loss terms. Let $S_{i,j}^+ = \\max(S_{i,j}, 0)$ be the stoichiometric coefficient for production and $S_{i,j}^- = \\max(-S_{i,j}, 0)$ be the stoichiometric coefficient for loss. Then $S_{i,j} = S_{i,j}^+ - S_{i,j}^-$.\n\nThe $i$-th component of the production vector $\\mathcal{P}$ is the sum over all reactions that produce species $i$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{P}_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{9} S_{i,j}^+ r_j = \\sum_{j \\,\\mid\\, S_{i,j}>0} S_{i,j} r_j\n$$\nThe $i$-th component of the loss vector $\\mathcal{L}$ is the sum over all reactions that consume species $i$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{9} S_{i,j}^- r_j = \\sum_{j \\,\\mid\\, S_{i,j}<0} (-S_{i,j}) r_j\n$$\nWith these definitions, we have $\\dot{n}_i = \\mathcal{P}_i - \\mathcal{L}_i$, and therefore $\\dot{\\mathbf{n}} = \\mathcal{P} - \\mathcal{L}$.\n\n### Task 3: Verify Elemental Conservation\n\nElemental conservation implies that the total number of atoms of each element (H, O, C) is constant over time. This corresponds to the existence of left null vectors of $S$. Let $\\mathbf{c}$ be a vector where $c_i$ is the number of atoms of a particular element in species $i$. The total number of atoms of that element is $N = \\mathbf{c}^\\top\\mathbf{n}$. Its time derivative is $\\dot{N} = \\mathbf{c}^\\top\\dot{\\mathbf{n}} = \\mathbf{c}^\\top S \\mathbf{r}$. For $N$ to be conserved for any reaction rates $\\mathbf{r}$, we must have $\\mathbf{c}^\\top S = \\mathbf{0}^\\top$.\n\nWe define the atom-counting vectors for Hydrogen, Oxygen, and Carbon based on the species list $\\mathbf{x} = \\big( \\mathrm{H_2O}, \\mathrm{OH}, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{O}, \\mathrm{O_2}, \\mathrm{O_3}, \\mathrm{HO_2}, \\mathrm{H_2O_2}, \\mathrm{CO}, \\mathrm{CO_2} \\big)$:\n\n- **Hydrogen (H):** $\\mathbf{c}_{\\mathrm{H}}^\\top = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n- **Oxygen (O):** $\\mathbf{c}_{\\mathrm{O}}^\\top = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n- **Carbon (C):** $\\mathbf{c}_{\\mathrm{C}}^\\top = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe condition $\\mathbf{c}^\\top S = \\mathbf{0}^\\top$ means that for each column $j$ of $S$, the dot product with $\\mathbf{c}$ is zero: $\\sum_i c_i S_{i,j} = 0$. This is the mathematical statement that the number of atoms of a given element is balanced in each reaction. We can verify this for each element and each reaction. For example, for reaction $j=8$ ($\\mathrm{OH} + \\mathrm{CO} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{CO_2} + \\mathrm{H}$) and the hydrogen vector $\\mathbf{c}_\\mathrm{H}$:\n$(\\mathbf{c}_{\\mathrm{H}}^\\top S)_{8} = c_{\\mathrm{H},2}S_{2,8} + c_{\\mathrm{H},3}S_{3,8} + c_{\\mathrm{H},9}S_{9,8} + c_{\\mathrm{H},10}S_{10,8} = (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (0)(-1) + (0)(1) = 0$.\nThe same holds for all nine reactions and all three elemental vectors, which confirms that $\\mathbf{c}_{\\mathrm{H}}$, $\\mathbf{c}_{\\mathrm{O}}$, and $\\mathbf{c}_{\\mathrm{C}}$ are in the left nullspace of $S$.\n\n### Task 4: Determine the Dimension of the Left Nullspace of $S$\n\nThe left nullspace of $S$ is the nullspace of its transpose, $\\ker(S^\\top)$. The dimension of this space is given by the rank-nullity theorem applied to $S^\\top$, which is a $9 \\times 10$ matrix:\n$$ \\dim(\\ker(S^\\top)) = (\\text{number of columns of } S^\\top) - \\text{rank}(S^\\top) $$\nSince $\\text{rank}(S^\\top) = \\text{rank}(S)$ and $S^\\top$ has $10$ columns, we have:\n$$ \\dim(\\ker(S^\\top)) = 10 - \\text{rank}(S) $$\nWe must therefore find the rank of the $10 \\times 9$ matrix $S$. The rank is the number of linearly independent columns (or rows). Let the columns of $S$ be denoted by $\\mathbf{s}_j$ for $j=1,\\dots,9$.\n\nBy inspection of the columns of $S$:\n- Column 2 is the negative of Column 1: $\\mathbf{s}_2 = -\\mathbf{s}_1$. This corresponds to reaction 2 being the reverse of reaction 1.\n- Column 4 is the negative of Column 3: $\\mathbf{s}_4 = -\\mathbf{s}_3$. This corresponds to reaction 4 being the reverse of reaction 3.\n\nThese two dependencies imply that the rank of $S$ is at most $9 - 2 = 7$. To find the exact rank, we check for linear independence of the remaining set of $7$ columns: $\\{\\mathbf{s}_1, \\mathbf{s}_3, \\mathbf{s}_5, \\mathbf{s}_6, \\mathbf{s}_7, \\mathbf{s}_8, \\mathbf{s}_9\\}$. Let's test if a linear combination of these can be the zero vector:\n$a_1\\mathbf{s}_1 + a_3\\mathbf{s}_3 + a_5\\mathbf{s}_5 + a_6\\mathbf{s}_6 + a_7\\mathbf{s}_7 + a_8\\mathbf{s}_8 + a_9\\mathbf{s}_9 = \\mathbf{0}$.\n\nThis vector equation gives a system of $10$ linear equations for the $7$ coefficients $a_j$.\n- Equation for row 1 (H$_2$O): $-a_1 = 0 \\implies a_1 = 0$.\n- Equation for row 6 (O$_3$): $a_3 = 0$.\n- Equation for row 4 (O): $-a_3 + a_9 = 0$. Since $a_3=0$, this implies $a_9 = 0$.\n- Equation for row 9 (CO): $-a_8 + a_9 = 0$. Since $a_9=0$, this implies $a_8 = 0$.\n- So far, we have $a_1=a_3=a_8=a_9=0$. The equation reduces to $a_5\\mathbf{s}_5 + a_6\\mathbf{s}_6 + a_7\\mathbf{s}_7 = \\mathbf{0}$.\n- Equation for row 2 (OH): $2a_6 = 0 \\implies a_6 = 0$.\n- Equation for row 7 (HO$_2$): $-2a_5 + a_7 = 0$.\n- Equation for row 8 (H$_2$O$_2$): $a_5 - a_6 = 0$. Since $a_6=0$, this implies $a_5 = 0$.\n- Substituting $a_5=0$ into the equation from row 7 gives $a_7=0$.\n\nAll coefficients must be zero. Thus, the set $\\{\\mathbf{s}_1, \\mathbf{s}_3, \\mathbf{s}_5, \\mathbf{s}_6, \\mathbf{s}_7, \\mathbf{s}_8, \\mathbf{s}_9\\}$ is linearly independent. The rank of $S$ is therefore exactly $7$.\n\nUsing the rank-nullity theorem, the dimension of the left nullspace is:\n$$ \\dim(\\ker(S^\\top)) = 10 - \\text{rank}(S) = 10 - 7 = 3 $$\n\nThis result is consistent with our findings in Task 3. We identified three vectors, $\\mathbf{c}_{\\mathrm{H}}, \\mathbf{c}_{\\mathrm{O}}, \\mathbf{c}_{\\mathrm{C}}$, that lie in the left nullspace of $S$. Let's verify their linear independence. Assume $k_1\\mathbf{c}_{\\mathrm{H}} + k_2\\mathbf{c}_{\\mathrm{O}} + k_3\\mathbf{c}_{\\mathrm{C}} = \\mathbf{0}$.\n- From the 9th component (CO): $k_2(1) + k_3(1) = 0 \\implies k_3 = -k_2$.\n- From the 10th component (CO$_2$): $k_2(2) + k_3(1) = 0 \\implies 2k_2 - k_2 = 0 \\implies k_2 = 0$.\n- This also implies $k_3 = 0$.\n- From the 1st component (H$_2$O): $k_1(2) + k_2(1) = 0 \\implies 2k_1 = 0 \\implies k_1=0$.\nSince all coefficients must be zero, the vectors $\\mathbf{c}_{\\mathrm{H}}, \\mathbf{c}_{\\mathrm{O}}, \\mathbf{c}_{\\mathrm{C}}$ are linearly independent. We have found $3$ linearly independent vectors in a space of dimension $3$, which means these vectors form a basis for the left nullspace of $S$. The dimension is $3$.",
