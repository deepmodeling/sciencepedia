The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\nThe task is to derive the magnitude of the dry adiabatic lapse rate, $\\Gamma_d$, calculate its value for a specific exoplanetary atmosphere, and compare it to a simulated lapse rate, $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{sim}}$. The final result is the superadiabatic excess lapse rate, $\\Delta \\Gamma$.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the dry adiabatic lapse rate, $\\Gamma_d \\equiv -\\frac{dT}{dz}$. We begin with the First Law of Thermodynamics for a reversible process, which can be written in terms of specific enthalpy, $h$, as:\n$$ T \\mathrm{d}s = \\mathrm{d}h - \\frac{1}{\\rho}\\mathrm{d}p $$\nwhere $T$ is temperature, $s$ is specific entropy, $\\rho$ is density, and $p$ is pressure. For an ideal gas, the change in specific enthalpy is given by $\\mathrm{d}h = c_p \\mathrm{d}T$, where $c_p$ is the constant-pressure specific heat. The problem specifies a reversible, adiabatic displacement of a gas parcel, meaning the process is isentropic, so the change in specific entropy is $\\mathrm{d}s = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these relations into the first law yields:\n$$ 0 = c_p \\mathrm{d}T - \\frac{1}{\\rho}\\mathrm{d}p $$\nRearranging this equation gives the change in temperature with respect to pressure for an adiabatic process:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{\\mathrm{d}p} = \\frac{1}{\\rho c_p} $$\nThe goal is to find the lapse rate, which is the change in temperature with respect to geopotential height, $z$. We can use the chain rule to relate the temperature gradient with height to the temperature gradient with pressure:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{\\mathrm{d}z} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{\\mathrm{d}p} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}z} $$\nThe problem provides the equation for hydrostatic balance:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}z} = -\\rho g $$\nwhere $g$ is the gravitational acceleration.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{\\mathrm{d}p}$ and $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p}{\\mathrm{d}z}$ into the chain rule equation, we obtain:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{\\mathrm{d}z} = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\rho c_p} \\right) (-\\rho g) $$\nThe density, $\\rho$, cancels out, leaving:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}T}{\\mathrm{d}z} = -\\frac{g}{c_p} $$\nThe dry adiabatic lapse rate magnitude, $\\Gamma_d$, is defined as $-\\frac{dT}{dz}$. Therefore, we have:\n$$ \\Gamma_d = - \\left( -\\frac{g}{c_p} \\right) = \\frac{g}{c_p} $$\nThis is the derived expression for the magnitude of the dry adiabatic lapse rate.\n\nNext, we evaluate $\\Gamma_d$ using the provided parameters for the mini-Neptune:\n- Gravitational acceleration: $g = 12.0 \\ \\mathrm{m} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-2}$\n- Constant-pressure specific heat: $c_p = 1.20 \\times 10^{4} \\ \\mathrm{J} \\ \\mathrm{kg}^{-1} \\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived expression:\n$$ \\Gamma_d = \\frac{12.0 \\ \\mathrm{m} \\ \\mathrm{s}^{-2}}{1.20 \\times 10^{4} \\ \\mathrm{J} \\ \\mathrm{kg}^{-1} \\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}} $$\nThe unit of the Joule, $\\mathrm{J}$, is $\\mathrm{kg} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^2 \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-2}$.

A temperature profile is superadiabatic if its lapse rate magnitude is greater than the dry adiabatic lapse rate magnitude ($\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{sim}} > \\Gamma_d$). In this case, $1.38 > 1.00$, confirming that the simulated atmospheric profile is superadiabatic. This implies the region is convectively unstable.\n\nFinally, we calculate the superadiabatic excess lapse rate, $\\Delta \\Gamma$, defined as $\\Delta \\Gamma \\equiv \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{sim}} - \\Gamma_{d}$.\n$$ \\Delta \\Gamma = 1.38 \\ \\mathrm{K} \\ \\mathrm{km}^{-1} - 1.00 \\ \\mathrm{K} \\ \\mathrm{km}^{-1} = 0.38 \\ \\mathrm{K} \\ \\mathrm{km}^{-1} $$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\Delta \\Gamma = 0.3800 \\ \\mathrm{K} \\ \\mathrm{km}^{-1} $$",
