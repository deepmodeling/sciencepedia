The concepts of a tide-generating potential, spherical harmonic expansion, and Love numbers are well-established and form the basis of this field.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined with a sequence of tasks that lead to a unique solution. It provides all necessary parameters and constants for the required derivation and numerical calculation.\n3.  **Objective**: The language is technical and precise, with no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. All necessary variables, constants, and simplifying assumptions (circular orbit, synchronous rotation, negligible obliquity) are provided. There are no contradictions. The assumptions are standard for an introductory treatment of static tides.\n5.  **Realism and Feasibility**: The given parameters describe a super-Earth exoplanet orbiting a red dwarf star.

A quick calculation shows the planet's bulk density is $\\rho_p \\approx 5.6 \\times 10^3\\ \\text{kg}\\cdot\\text{m}^{-3}$, which is a very reasonable value for a rocky super-Earth. The Love number $h_2=0.25$ is also a plausible value for such a planet.\n6.  **Structure and Triviality**: The problem is well-structured and non-trivial. It requires a correct application of potential theory and the definition of Love numbers, which is a standard but substantive exercise in geophysics and planetary science.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and all provided data are consistent and physically reasonable. It is a valid problem. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution is developed in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: Tide-Generating Potential**\nLet the center of the planet be the origin of our coordinate system. The star, of mass $M_{\\star}$, is at a position vector $\\vec{d}$, where $|\\vec{d}| = a$. A point of interest within or on the planet is located at position vector $\\vec{r}$ from the origin, with magnitude $r$. The angle between $\\vec{d}$ and $\\vec{r}$ is the zenith angle $\\theta$. The substellar point corresponds to $\\theta=0$.\n\nThe gravitational potential from the star at the point $\\vec{r}$ is:\n$$U_{\\star}(\\vec{r}) = -\\frac{G M_{\\star}}{|\\vec{d} - \\vec{r}|}$$\nUsing the law of cosines, $|\\vec{d} - \\vec{r}| = \\sqrt{a^2 + r^2 - 2ar\\cos\\theta}$. We can expand the potential in a series of Legendre polynomials, $P_{n}(\\cos\\theta)$, for $r  a$:\n$$U_{\\star}(\\vec{r}) = -\\frac{G M_{\\star}}{a} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^n P_n(\\cos\\theta)$$\nThe tide-generating potential, $W$, is the differential potential across the planet. It is obtained by removing the $n=0$ term (which is a constant potential) and the $n=1$ term (which corresponds to the uniform acceleration of the planet's center of mass) from the full expansion. The remaining series, starting from $n=2$, produces the tidal distortion.\n$$W(\\vec{r}) = -\\frac{G M_{\\star}}{a} \\sum_{n=2}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{r}{a}\\right)^n P_n(\\cos\\theta)$$\nThe leading-order, degree-two component of this potential is the $n=2$ term:\n$$W_2(r, \\theta) = -\\frac{G M_{\\star} r^2}{a^3} P_2(\\cos\\theta)$$\nwhere $P_2(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(3x^2 - 1)$.\nThe problem asks for this potential at the planetary surface, where $r=R_p$.\n$$W_2(R_p, \\theta) = -\\frac{G M_{\\star} R_p^2}{a^3} P_2(\\cos\\theta)$$\nThis is the general expression for the degree-two tide-generating potential at the surface. At the substellar point, $\\theta=0$, so $\\cos\\theta=1$. Since $P_2(1) = \\frac{1}{2}(3 \\cdot 1^2 - 1) = 1$, the potential at this specific point is:\n$$W_2|_{\\text{substellar}} = -\\frac{G M_{\\star} R_p^2}{a^3}$$\n\n**Part 2: Radial Displacement Expression**\nThe static radial displacement of the surface, $\\xi_r$, is related to the tide-generating potential, $W_2$, by the degree-two displacement Love number, $h_2$. The height of the tidal bulge is proportional to the forcing potential and inversely proportional to the planet's own surface gravity, $g$. The potential $W_2$ represents a potential well; the force is given by $-\\nabla W_2$, which points away from the center where the potential is most negative (i.e., at the substellar and anti-stellar points). Thus, the displacement $\\xi_r$ is positive (outward) at these points. The relationship is:\n$$\\xi_r(\\theta) = \\frac{h_2 W_2(R_p, \\theta)}{g}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $W_2(R_p, \\theta)$:\n$$\\xi_r(\\theta) = \\frac{h_2}{g} \\left(-\\frac{G M_{\\star} R_p^2}{a^3} P_2(\\cos\\theta)\\right)$$\nThis formula seems incorrect as it would give a negative displacement. The standard convention relates the displacement to the potential as $\\xi_r(\\theta) = \\frac{h_2 U(\\theta)}{g}$ where $U$ is the perturbing potential. Let's use the common formulation where the tide-raising potential is defined as positive for bulges. Let $W_2' = -W_2$. Then $\\xi_r(\\theta) = \\frac{h_2 W_2'(\\theta)}{g}$. Or we can stick to the solution's logic which implicitly corrects the sign. Let's re-trace the solution's derivation which has an extra minus sign in the definition:\n$$\\xi_r(\\theta) = -\\frac{h_2 W_2(R_p, \\theta)}{g}$$\n$$\\xi_r(\\theta) = -\\frac{h_2}{g} \\left(-\\frac{G M_{\\star} R_p^2}{a^3} P_2(\\cos\\theta)\\right) = \\frac{h_2}{g} \\frac{G M_{\\star} R_p^2}{a^3} P_2(\\cos\\theta)$$\nThis gives the correct positive displacement.\nThe surface gravity of the planet is given by Newton's law of gravitation:\n$$g = \\frac{G M_p}{R_p^2}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $g$ into the equation for $\\xi_r$:\n$$\\xi_r(\\theta) = h_2 \\left(\\frac{R_p^2}{G M_p}\\right) \\left(\\frac{G M_{\\star} R_p^2}{a^3}\\right) P_2(\\cos\\theta)$$\nThe gravitational constant $G$ cancels out, leading to a simplified expression:\n$$\\xi_r(\\theta) = h_2 \\frac{M_{\\star}}{M_p} \\frac{R_p^4}{a^3} P_2(\\cos\\theta)$$\nTo find the displacement at the substellar point, we set $\\theta=0$, which gives $P_2(\\cos 0) = 1$. The final expression for the radial displacement at the substellar point is:\n$$\\xi_r = h_2 \\left(\\frac{M_{\\star}}{M_p}\\right) \\frac{R_p^4}{a^3}$$\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Calculation**\nFirst, we convert all given parameters into base SI units (meters and kilograms).\n- $M_{\\star} = 0.25 \\times (1.9885 \\times 10^{30}\\ \\text{kg}) = 4.97125 \\times 10^{29}\\ \\text{kg}$\n- $a = 0.05 \\times (1.495978707 \\times 10^{11}\\ \\text{m}) = 7.479893535 \\times 10^{9}\\ \\text{m}$\n- $M_p = 6.0 \\times (5.972 \\times 10^{24}\\ \\text{kg}) = 3.5832 \\times 10^{25}\\ \\text{kg}$\n- $R_p = 1.8 \\times (6.371 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\text{m}) = 1.14678 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\text{m}$\n- $h_2 = 0.25$ (dimensionless)\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the derived expression for $\\xi_r$:\n$$\\xi_r = (0.25) \\left(\\frac{4.97125 \\times 10^{29}\\ \\text{kg}}{3.5832 \\times 10^{25}\\ \\text{kg}}\\right) \\frac{(1.14678 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\text{m})^4}{(7.479893535 \\times 10^{9}\\ \\text{m})^3}$$\nLet's calculate the components of the expression:\n- Mass ratio: $\\frac{M_{\\star}}{M_p} = \\frac{4.97125 \\times 10^{29}}{3.5832 \\times 10^{25}} \\approx 13873.33$\n- Planetary radius to the fourth power: $R_p^4 = (1.14678 \\times 10^{7})^4 \\ \\text{m}^4 \\approx 1.73030 \\times 10^{28}\\ \\text{m}^4$\n- Semi-major axis to the third power: $a^3 = (7.479893535 \\times 10^{9})^3 \\ \\text{m}^3 \\approx 4.18593 \\times 10^{29}\\ \\text{m}^3$\n\nCombining these results:\n$$\\xi_r \\approx (0.25) \\times (13873.33) \\times \\frac{1.73030 \\times 10^{28}}{4.18593 \\times 10^{29}}\\ \\text{m}$$\n$$\\xi_r \\approx (0.25) \\times (13873.33) \\times (0.0413364)\\ \\text{m}$$\n$$\\xi_r \\approx 143.374\\ \\text{m}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\\xi_r \\approx 143\\ \\text{m}$$",

Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation and Solution\n\nThe goal is to derive an expression for the maximum heat flux, $q_{\\max}$, that can be transported through the planet's mantle without triggering the formation of a global magma ocean.\n\nThe surface heat flux, $q$, is given by the conductive transport across the top thermal boundary layer:\n$$q = \\mathrm{Nu}\\,\\frac{k\\,\\Delta T}{d}$$\nwhere $\\Delta T = T_p - T_s$ is the temperature difference between the mantle potential temperature $T_p$ and the surface temperature $T_s$.\n\nThe Nusselt number, $\\mathrm{Nu}$, is related to the Rayleigh number, $\\mathrm{Ra}$, by the scaling law:\n$$\\mathrm{Nu} = C\\,\\mathrm{Ra}^{\\beta}$$\nThe Rayleigh number is defined as:\n$$\\mathrm{Ra} = \\frac{\\alpha \\,\\rho\\, g\\, \\Delta T\\, d^{3}}{\\kappa\\, \\eta}$$\nFirst, we substitute the expression for the Rayleigh number into the Nusselt number scaling law:\n$$\\mathrm{Nu} = C \\left( \\frac{\\alpha \\,\\rho\\, g\\, \\Delta T\\, d^{3}}{\\kappa\\, \\eta} \\right)^{\\beta}$$\nNext, we substitute this expression for $\\mathrm{Nu}$ into the equation for the heat flux $q$:\n$$q = \\left[ C \\left( \\frac{\\alpha \\,\\rho\\, g\\, \\Delta T\\, d^{3}}{\\kappa\\, \\eta} \\right)^{\\beta} \\right] \\frac{k\\,\\Delta T}{d}$$\nWe can rearrange this expression by grouping terms involving $\\Delta T$ and $d$:\n$$q = C\\,k\\,\\frac{\\Delta T}{d} (\\Delta T)^{\\beta} \\left( \\frac{\\alpha \\,\\rho\\, g}{\\kappa\\, \\eta} \\right)^{\\beta} (d^3)^{\\beta}$$\n$$q = C\\,k\\,d^{3\\beta - 1} (\\Delta T)^{1+\\beta} \\left( \\frac{\\alpha \\,\\rho\\, g}{\\kappa\\, \\eta} \\right)^{\\beta}$$\nThis is the general expression for the heat flux $q$ as a function of the temperature drop $\\Delta T$.\n\nA crucial feature of this relationship arises for the specific case where the scaling exponent is $\\beta = 1/3$, as given in the problem. In this case, the exponent of the mantle thickness $d$ becomes:\n$$3\\beta - 1 = 3\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0$$\nThis means $d^{3\\beta-1} = d^0 = 1$, and the heat flux becomes independent of the mantle thickness $d$:\n$$q = C\\,k\\, (\\Delta T)^{4/3} \\left( \\frac{\\alpha \\,\\rho\\, g}{\\kappa\\, \\eta} \\right)^{1/3}$$\nThis is a classic result for isoviscous, steady-state mantle convection with a $\\beta=1/3$ scaling.\n\nThe problem states that the maximum transportable heat flux, $q_{\\max}$, is achieved at the limit where a global magma ocean is about to form. This occurs when the mantle potential temperature $T_p$ approaches the zero-pressure liquidus temperature, $T_p \\to T_{\\mathrm{liq},0}$. At this limit, the temperature difference across the boundary layer is at its maximum value:\n$$\\Delta T_{\\max} = T_{\\mathrm{liq},0} - T_{s}$$\nSubstituting $\\Delta T_{\\max}$ into our derived expression for $q$ gives the expression for the maximum heat flux, $q_{\\max}$:\n$$q_{\\max} = C\\,k\\,(T_{\\mathrm{liq},0} - T_{s})^{4/3} \\left( \\frac{\\alpha \\,\\rho\\, g}{\\kappa\\, \\eta} \\right)^{1/3}$$\nThis is the desired analytical expression derived from first principles.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically using the given parameters:\n-   $C = 0.27$\n-   $k = 4.0\\ \\mathrm{W\\ m^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}$\n-   $T_{\\mathrm{liq},0} = 2000\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n-   $T_{s} = 300\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n-   $\\alpha = 3.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{K^{-1}}$\n-   $\\rho = 4.5 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{kg\\ m^{-3}}$\n-   $g = 15\\ \\mathrm{m\\ s^{-2}}$\n-   $\\kappa = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}\\ s^{-1}}$\n-   $\\eta = 1.0 \\times 10^{20}\\ \\mathrm{Pa\\ s}$\n\nFirst, calculate the maximum temperature difference:\n$$\\Delta T_{\\max} = 2000\\ \\mathrm{K} - 300\\ \\mathrm{K} = 1700\\ \\mathrm{K}$$\nNext, calculate the term within the parenthesis:\n$$\\frac{\\alpha \\,\\rho\\, g}{\\kappa\\, \\eta} = \\frac{(3.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{K^{-1}}) (4.5 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{kg\\ m^{-3}}) (15\\ \\mathrm{m\\ s^{-2}})}{(1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}\\ s^{-1}}) (1.0 \\times 10^{20}\\ \\mathrm{Pa\\ s})}$$\n$$\\frac{\\alpha \\,\\rho\\, g}{\\kappa\\, \\eta} = \\frac{2.025\\ \\mathrm{kg\\ m^{-2}\\ s^{-2}\\ K^{-1}}}{1.0 \\times 10^{14}\\ \\mathrm{kg\\ m\\ s^{-1}}} = 2.025 \\times 10^{-14}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-3}\\ K^{-1}}$$\nNow, we can compute the components of the $q_{\\max}$ expression:\n$$(T_{\\mathrm{liq},0} - T_{s})^{4/3} = (1700)^{4/3}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{4/3} \\approx 20289.9\\ \\mathrm{K}^{4/3}$$\n$$\\left( \\frac{\\alpha \\,\\rho\\, g}{\\kappa\\, \\eta} \\right)^{1/3} = (2.025 \\times 10^{-14}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-3}\\ K^{-1}})^{1/3} \\approx 2.7255 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-1}\\ K^{-1/3}}$$\nFinally, combine all terms to calculate $q_{\\max}$:\n$$q_{\\max} = (0.27) \\times (4.0\\ \\mathrm{W\\ m^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}) \\times (20289.9\\ \\mathrm{K}^{4/3}) \\times (2.7255 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-1}\\ K^{-1/3}})$$\n$$q_{\\max} = 1.08 \\times 20289.9 \\times 2.7255 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{W\\ m^{-2}}$$\n$$q_{\\max} \\approx 0.597184\\ \\mathrm{W\\ m^{-2}}$$\nRounding the final answer to three significant figures gives:\n$$q_{\\max} \\approx 0.597\\ \\mathrm{W\\ m^{-2}}$$",
