            "problem": "A planet of mass $M_{p}$ on a circular orbit of radius $r_{p}$ is embedded in a locally isothermal gaseous disk around a star of mass $M_{\\star}$. The disk has vertical hydrostatic equilibrium with density profile $\\rho(z)=\\rho_{0}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\dfrac{z^{2}}{2H^{2}}\\right)$ and scale height $H=c_{s}/\\Omega_{p}$, where $c_{s}$ is the isothermal sound speed and $\\Omega_{p}$ is the Keplerian angular frequency at $r_{p}$. In three-dimensional (3D) calculations, the gravitational potential of the planet at cylindrical radius $r$ and height $z$ is $\\Phi_{3\\mathrm{D}}(r,z)=-GM_{p}/\\sqrt{r^{2}+z^{2}}$. In two-dimensional (2D) simulations, it is customary to soften the potential as $\\Phi_{2\\mathrm{D}}(r)=-GM_{p}/\\sqrt{r^{2}+\\epsilon^{2}}$ with a softening length $\\epsilon$.\n\nStarting from Newtonian gravity and the stated isothermal vertical structure, consider the vertically averaged planetary forcing felt by the disk, defined by replacing the 3D potential with a surface density–weighted average over $z$. The net differential Lindblad torque amplitude depends on the near-planet forcing and is known to differ between 2D and 3D unless the softening length is chosen appropriately.\n\nWhich option correctly explains the physical meaning of the softening length $\\epsilon$ in two-dimensional (2D) simulations and presents a physically justified criterion for its magnitude that makes the two-dimensional (2D) torque amplitude agree with the three-dimensional (3D) result across typical aspect ratios?\n\nA. $\\epsilon$ represents the effective vertical averaging of the planet’s gravitational field over the disk thickness, and choosing $\\epsilon$ such that the softened in-plane force $GM_{p}/(r^{2}+\\epsilon^{2})^{3/2}$ matches the surface density–weighted vertically averaged 3D force near $r\\sim H$ yields $\\epsilon$ in the range $\\epsilon\\approx(0.6$–$1.0)H$, depending weakly on the resonance weighting and equation of state.\n\nB. $\\epsilon$ represents the lateral extent of the planet’s sphere of influence, and setting $\\epsilon$ equal to the Hill radius $R_{H}=r_{p}\\left(M_{p}/3M_{\\star}\\right)^{1/3}$ ensures that the two-dimensional (2D) torque amplitude matches the three-dimensional (3D) torque because gap opening physics determines the torque.\n\nC. $\\epsilon$ accounts for pressure support around the planet, and taking $\\epsilon$ equal to the Bondi radius $R_{B}=GM_{p}/c_{s}^{2}$ ensures the correct torque amplitude, since the radius of gas bound to the planet sets the effective force felt by the disk.\n\nD. $\\epsilon$ is a numerical regularization length chosen to suppress singular forces at the grid scale; hence the correct physical choice is $\\epsilon$ equal to the local grid spacing $\\Delta r$ so that the computed torque is stable and convergent.\n\nE. $\\epsilon$ is fixed by matching the midplane Laplacian of the softened two-dimensional (2D) potential to the three-dimensional (3D) one, leading to $\\epsilon=H/\\sqrt{12}$, which produces the correct torque amplitude because the curvature of the potential controls the wake excitation.",
            "solution": "The goal is to connect the softening length $\\epsilon$ in two-dimensional (2D) simulations to a physically motivated measure of how vertical thickness dilutes the gravitational forcing in three-dimensional (3D) disks, and then to show that matching the force felt by the gas near the dominant torque-generating region leads to $\\epsilon$ comparable to the disk scale height $H$.\n\nPrinciple-based derivation:\n\n1. Begin with Newtonian gravity. The planetary gravitational potential in three dimensions is $\\Phi_{3\\mathrm{D}}(r,z)=-GM_{p}/\\sqrt{r^{2}+z^{2}}$. The gravitational force per unit mass in the plane at a cylindrical separation $r$ and vertical height $z$ has magnitude $F_{3\\mathrm{D}}(r,z)=GM_{p}/(r^{2}+z^{2})^{3/2}$ directed toward the planet.\n\n2. The disk’s linear response that sets the differential Lindblad torque is excited by the in-plane Fourier components of the forcing potential. In a vertically stratified disk, the in-plane forcing felt by the bulk of the gas is a surface density–weighted vertical average. Define the vertically averaged in-plane force per unit mass at separation $r$,\n$$\n\\langle F_{3\\mathrm{D}}(r)\\rangle \\equiv \\frac{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\rho(z)\\, \\frac{GM_{p}}{(r^{2}+z^{2})^{3/2}}\\, dz}{\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\rho(z)\\, dz}.\n$$\nWith $\\rho(z)=\\rho_{0}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{z^{2}}{2H^{2}}\\right)$, the surface density is $\\Sigma=\\int \\rho\\,dz=\\rho_{0}\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\,H$.\n\n3. In two-dimensional (2D) simulations, one replaces this vertically averaged 3D force with the softened midplane force from $\\Phi_{2\\mathrm{D}}(r)=-GM_{p}/\\sqrt{r^{2}+\\epsilon^{2}}$, so the in-plane force per unit mass is\n$$\nF_{2\\mathrm{D}}(r)=\\frac{GM_{p}}{(r^{2}+\\epsilon^{2})^{3/2}}.\n$$\n\n4. A physically motivated criterion for $\\epsilon$ is to match the typical in-plane forcing felt by the stratified disk in three-dimensional (3D) with the softened two-dimensional (2D) force at the separations that dominate torque excitation. The differential Lindblad torque kernel peaks around separations of order the disk scale height $r\\sim H$ when the disk aspect ratio $h\\equiv H/r_{p}$ is small. Therefore, impose\n$$\nF_{2\\mathrm{D}}(H)\\approx \\langle F_{3\\mathrm{D}}(H)\\rangle.\n$$\n\n5. Compute $\\langle F_{3\\mathrm{D}}(H)\\rangle$. Using $z=Hu$,\n$$\n\\langle F_{3\\mathrm{D}}(H)\\rangle = \\frac{GM_{p}}{\\Sigma}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\rho_{0}e^{-u^{2}/2}\\frac{H\\,du}{\\left(H^{2}+H^{2}u^{2}\\right)^{3/2}}\n= \\frac{GM_{p}}{\\Sigma}\\frac{\\rho_{0}}{H^{2}}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{e^{-u^{2}/2}}{(1+u^{2})^{3/2}}\\, du.\n$$\nDefine\n$$\nJ \\equiv \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{e^{-u^{2}/2}}{(1+u^{2})^{3/2}}\\, du,\n$$\nso that\n$$\n\\langle F_{3\\mathrm{D}}(H)\\rangle = \\frac{GM_{p}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\,H^{3}}\\, J.\n$$\n\n6. Matching $F_{2\\mathrm{D}}(H)=\\langle F_{3\\mathrm{D}}(H)\\rangle$ gives\n$$\n\\frac{GM_{p}}{(H^{2}+\\epsilon^{2})^{3/2}}=\\frac{GM_{p}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\,H^{3}}\\, J\n\\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad\n\\left(1+\\frac{\\epsilon^{2}}{H^{2}}\\right)^{3/2}=\\frac{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}{J}.\n$$\nTherefore\n$$\n\\frac{\\epsilon}{H}=\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}{J}\\right)^{2/3}-1}.\n$$\n\n7. Estimate $J$ numerically. The integrand is even, so $J=2\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-u^{2}/2}/(1+u^{2})^{3/2}\\, du$. A simple quadrature yields $J\\approx 1.40$ (for instance, Simpson’s rule with step $0.5$ gives $J\\approx 1.404$). Then $\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\approx 2.5066$, hence $\\sqrt{2\\pi}/J\\approx 1.79$, and\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}{J}\\right)^{2/3} \\approx 1.49,\\quad \\frac{\\epsilon}{H}\\approx \\sqrt{1.49-1}\\approx 0.70.\n$$\nThis shows that a single constant softening length chosen to match the vertically averaged force near $r\\sim H$ is $\\epsilon\\approx 0.7H$.\n\n8. Connection to torque amplitude. The net differential Lindblad torque amplitude is an integral over resonances whose radial coupling to the planet’s potential is weighted by the wake excitation kernel. Different choices of weighting (e.g., emphasizing slightly different $r/H$ where the kernel peaks, or including thermodynamic effects that alter the vertical density profile) shift the optimal $\\epsilon$ mildly. This produces a physically reasonable range $\\epsilon\\approx (0.6$–$1.0)H$ across typical disk aspect ratios and equations of state, which is consistent with detailed three-dimensional (3D) versus two-dimensional (2D) torque comparisons.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. This option identifies $\\epsilon$ as a surrogate for vertical averaging and proposes matching the softened two-dimensional (2D) force to the surface density–weighted three-dimensional (3D) average near $r\\sim H$. The derivation above from Newtonian gravity and isothermal vertical structure yields $\\epsilon/H\\approx 0.7$, and recognizing modest dependence on resonance weighting and thermodynamics gives a justified range $\\epsilon\\approx (0.6$–$1.0)H$. This is physically correct and quantitatively consistent.\n\nB. This option ties $\\epsilon$ to the Hill radius $R_{H}=r_{p}\\left(M_{p}/3M_{\\star}\\right)^{1/3}$. The Hill radius is a measure of tidal truncation and gap opening in the nonlinear regime and depends on $M_{p}$. The vertical dilution of the gravitational field, which $\\epsilon$ is meant to capture in two-dimensional (2D), is controlled by disk thickness $H$ and not by $R_{H}$ for the linear torque regime that sets type I migration. Making $\\epsilon$ depend on $M_{p}$ via $R_{H}$ corrupts the torque scaling and fails to reproduce the three-dimensional (3D) linear torques.\n\nC. This option sets $\\epsilon$ to the Bondi radius $R_{B}=GM_{p}/c_{s}^{2}$. The Bondi radius measures the scale of bound gas in the planet’s envelope and again depends on $M_{p}$. In a vertically stratified disk, the dilution of in-plane forcing arises from averaging over $z$ with scale $H$, not from envelope binding physics. Using $R_{B}$ produces a mass-dependent softening that does not reproduce three-dimensional (3D) linear torque amplitudes across $M_{p}$ and typically underestimates or overestimates the torque depending on $M_{p}$.\n\nD. This option chooses $\\epsilon=\\Delta r$ (grid spacing), which is a purely numerical regularization. The torque amplitude would then be resolution dependent and would not converge to the correct physical value as the grid is refined. The softening length must reflect physical vertical averaging, i.e., scale with $H$, not numerical resolution.\n\nE. This option matches the midplane Laplacian of the potentials and claims $\\epsilon=H/\\sqrt{12}$. The curvature matching at the midplane does not guarantee correct vertically averaged in-plane forcing at the separations that dominate torque excitation; wake launching depends on the full radial dependence and vertical dilution, not solely on the midplane curvature. The proposed value $\\epsilon=H/\\sqrt{12}\\approx 0.29H$ is significantly smaller than the value required to match three-dimensional (3D) torques and would overestimate the force and torque in two dimensions.",
