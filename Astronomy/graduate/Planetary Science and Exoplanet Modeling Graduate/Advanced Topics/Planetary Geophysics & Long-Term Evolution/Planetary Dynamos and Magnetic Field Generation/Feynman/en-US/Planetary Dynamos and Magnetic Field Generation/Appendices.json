The central concept is the comparison between conduction current and displacement current, which is fundamental to defining the quasistatic approximation for good conductors. This approximation is standard in the study of planetary dynamos. The given values for conductivity and frequency are physically realistic for the specified context.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It requests the derivation of a specific physical ratio from fundamental laws and its subsequent numerical evaluation. All necessary parameters and constants are provided.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in objective, scientific language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires us to find the ratio $r \\equiv \\frac{|\\epsilon_0 \\,\\partial \\mathbf{E}/\\partial t|}{|\\mathbf{J}|}$. The numerator, $\\epsilon_0 \\,\\partial \\mathbf{E}/\\partial t$, is the displacement current density, which we denote as $\\mathbf{J}_D$. Thus, the ratio is $r = \\frac{|\\mathbf{J}_D|}{|\\mathbf{J}|}$.\n\nThe constitutive relation for conduction current density $\\mathbf{J}$ in a stationary, isotropic ohmic conductor is given by Ohm's law:\n$$ \\mathbf{J} = \\sigma \\mathbf{E} $$\nwhere $\\sigma$ is the electrical conductivity and $\\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field.\n\nThe problem states that the electric field is temporally harmonic with angular frequency $\\omega$. We can represent such a field using complex phasor notation. Let the electric field be expressed as the real part of a complex quantity:\n$$ \\mathbf{E}(\\mathbf{x}, t) = \\Re\\{\\tilde{\\mathbf{E}}(\\mathbf{x}) e^{i\\omega t}\\} $$\nwhere $\\tilde{\\mathbf{E}}(\\mathbf{x})$ is the complex amplitude (phasor) of the electric field, which may depend on position $\\mathbf{x}$, and $i$ is the imaginary unit.\n\nThe time derivative of the electric field is then:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t} = \\Re\\{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} (\\tilde{\\mathbf{E}} e^{i\\omega t})\\} = \\Re\\{i\\omega \\tilde{\\mathbf{E}} e^{i\\omega t}\\} $$\nThe displacement current density is:\n$$ \\mathbf{J}_D = \\epsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t} = \\Re\\{i\\omega \\epsilon_0 \\tilde{\\mathbf{E}} e^{i\\omega t}\\} $$\nThe corresponding phasor for the displacement current density is $\\tilde{\\mathbf{J}}_D = i\\omega \\epsilon_0 \\tilde{\\mathbf{E}}$.\n\nSimilarly, the conduction current density is:\n$$ \\mathbf{J} = \\sigma \\mathbf{E} = \\Re\\{\\sigma \\tilde{\\mathbf{E}} e^{i\\omega t}\\} $$\nThe phasor for the conduction current density is $\\tilde{\\mathbf{J}} = \\sigma \\tilde{\\mathbf{E}}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the magnitudes of the time-dependent vector fields, $r = \\frac{|\\mathbf{J}_D(t)|}{|\\mathbf{J}(t)|}$. For harmonic fields, these instantaneous magnitudes vary with time. For example, if $\\mathbf{E} = \\mathbf{E}_0 \\cos(\\omega t)$, then $\\mathbf{J} = \\sigma \\mathbf{E}_0 \\cos(\\omega t)$ and $\\mathbf{J}_D = -\\epsilon_0 \\omega \\mathbf{E}_0 \\sin(\\omega t)$. The ratio of their magnitudes would be $\\frac{\\epsilon_0 \\omega}{\\sigma}|\\tan(\\omega t)|$, which is time-dependent. However, in the context of comparing the significance of two harmonic quantities in physics and engineering, the standard practice is to compare their amplitudes. The problem's request for a single numerical evaluation reinforces this interpretation. We therefore proceed by calculating the ratio of the amplitudes (peak magnitudes) of the two current densities.\n\nThe amplitude of the displacement current density is the magnitude of its complex phasor:\n$$ |\\tilde{\\mathbf{J}}_D| = |i\\omega \\epsilon_0 \\tilde{\\mathbf{E}}| = |i||\\omega||\\epsilon_0||\\tilde{\\mathbf{E}}| = \\omega \\epsilon_0 |\\tilde{\\mathbf{E}}| $$\nsince $\\omega$ and $\\epsilon_0$ are positive real constants.\n\nThe amplitude of the conduction current density is similarly:\n$$ |\\tilde{\\mathbf{J}}| = |\\sigma \\tilde{\\mathbf{E}}| = \\sigma |\\tilde{\\mathbf{E}}| $$\nsince $\\sigma$ is a positive real constant.\n\nThe ratio $r$ of their amplitudes is:\n$$ r = \\frac{|\\tilde{\\mathbf{J}}_D|}{|\\tilde{\\mathbf{J}}|} = \\frac{\\omega \\epsilon_0 |\\tilde{\\mathbf{E}}|}{\\sigma |\\tilde{\\mathbf{E}}|} $$\nThe term $|\\tilde{\\mathbf{E}}|$ cancels out, provided the electric field is non-zero. This leaves the expression for the ratio in terms of the given parameters:\n$$ r = \\frac{\\epsilon_0 \\omega}{\\sigma} $$\nThis expression confirms that for a given material and frequency, the ratio is a constant. The smallness of this ratio is the mathematical justification for neglecting the displacement current in Ampere's law, which is the cornerstone of the quasistatic or MHD approximation for good conductors.\n\nNow, we evaluate this ratio using the provided numerical values:\n- $\\sigma = 8.0 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{S\\,m^{-1}}$\n- $\\omega = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n- $\\epsilon_0 = 8.854187817 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{F\\,m^{-1}}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $r$:\n$$ r = \\frac{(8.854187817 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{F\\,m^{-1}}) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}})}{8.0 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{S\\,m^{-1}}} $$\nThe units are $(\\mathrm{F\\,m^{-1}} \\cdot \\mathrm{s^{-1}}) / (\\mathrm{S\\,m^{-1}}) = (\\mathrm{F} \\cdot \\mathrm{s^{-1}}) / \\mathrm{S}$. Since $1\\ \\mathrm{S} = 1\\ \\mathrm{A/V}$ and $1\\ \\mathrm{F} = 1\\ \\mathrm{C/V} = 1\\ \\mathrm{A \\cdot s / V}$, we have $1\\ \\mathrm{S} = 1\\ \\mathrm{F/s}$. Therefore, the units cancel, and the ratio $r$ is dimensionless as required.\n\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$ r = \\frac{8.854187817 \\times 1.0}{8.0} \\times \\frac{10^{-12} \\times 10^{-6}}{10^{5}} $$\n$$ r = 1.106773477... \\times 10^{-18 - 5} $$\n$$ r = 1.106773477... \\times 10^{-23} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ r \\approx 1.11 \\times 10^{-23} $$\nThis extremely small value confirms that the displacement current is negligible compared to the conduction current, validating the use of the quasistatic approximation in this physical scenario.",

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is formulated objectively.

The problem narrative guides us through the theoretical background before arriving at the final calculation.\n\nTask 1 asks for the derivation of the turbulent magnetic diffusivity, $\\beta$. In mean-field electrodynamics, the mean electromotive force, $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{E}}} \\equiv \\overline{\\mathbf{u}' \\times \\mathbf{b}'}$, represents the effect of small-scale velocity fluctuations ($\\mathbf{u}'$) and magnetic field fluctuations ($\\mathbf{b}'$) on the large-scale magnetic field ($\\overline{\\mathbf{B}}$).

The expression for $\\beta$ becomes:\n$$\n\\beta = \\frac{1}{3} (u')^2 \\tau_c\n$$\nThe problem then instructs us to use a mixing-length estimate for the correlation time, $\\tau_c \\approx \\ell_c / u'$, where $\\ell_c$ is the dominant turbulent correlation length.

The small-scale magnetic Reynolds number, $\\mathrm{Rm}'$, is defined as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Rm}' \\equiv \\frac{u' \\ell_c}{\\eta}\n$$\nThis dimensionless number arises from comparing the magnitude of the two primary terms acting on the magnetic field at the turbulent scale $\\ell_c$: the advection (or stretching) term, $\\nabla \\times (\\mathbf{u}' \\times \\mathbf{B})$, and the diffusion term, $\\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B}$.

This assumption holds when the induced magnetic fluctuations are small. If $\\mathrm{Rm}' \\gg 1$, the advection term dominates, allowing small-scale fields to be efficiently amplified by the turbulence. These amplified fields can grow large enough for their associated Lorentz force to back-react on the velocity field, violating the fundamental assumption of FOSA. Thus, the value of $\\mathrm{Rm}'$ serves as a crucial diagnostic for the validity of this mean-field closure. The closure is considered robust for $\\mathrm{Rm}' \\lesssim 1$ and becomes questionable for $\\mathrm{Rm}' \\gg 1$.\n\nThe problem asks for the numerical value of the closure-diagnostic number $D \\equiv \\mathrm{Rm}'$.
