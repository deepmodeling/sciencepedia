            "problem": "Consider a rigidly rotating star observed at inclination angle $i$ (the angle between the stellar rotation axis and the line of sight), with projected equatorial rotational velocity $v \\sin i$. The unspotted stellar photosphere has specific intensity described by linear limb darkening, $I(\\mu) = I_{c}\\,[1 - u (1 - \\mu)]$, where $\\mu = \\cos \\gamma$ is the cosine of the angle $\\gamma$ between the local surface normal and the line of sight, $I_{c}$ is the disk-center intensity, and $u \\in [0,1]$ is the linear limb darkening coefficient. The disk-integrated flux of the unspotted star is $F_{\\star} = \\pi R^{2} I_{c} (1 - u/3)$, where $R$ is the stellar radius.\n\nA single, circular cool spot of small fractional projected area $f \\ll 1$ (defined such that, when the spot is at disk center, it covers fraction $f$ of the stellar disk area $\\pi R^{2}$) is located at latitude $\\ell$ on the stellar surface. The spot has contrast $\\chi \\in [0,1]$ relative to the local photosphere, meaning its specific intensity is $I_{\\text{spot}}(\\mu) = \\chi\\, I(\\mu)$ at the same $\\mu$. Assume the star's spectral lines are narrow compared to the rotational broadening, so that radial velocity (RV) is measured as the flux-weighted centroid of the rotationally broadened profile. Work in the small-spot (first-order in $f$) approximation, neglecting any changes to the stellar rotation law or line-shape other than the removal of spot flux.\n\nLet $\\phi$ be the rotational phase (stellar longitude), defined such that $\\phi = 0$ when the spot transits the central meridian. The local line-of-sight rotational velocity at the spot location is $v_{\\text{loc}}(\\phi) = (v \\sin i)\\, \\cos \\ell \\, \\sin \\phi$. The spot projection factor is $\\mu(\\phi) = \\cos \\ell \\cos \\phi \\sin i + \\sin \\ell \\cos i$. Assume $i$ and $\\ell$ satisfy $i < \\ell$, so the spot remains visible for all phases (i.e., $\\mu(\\phi) > 0$ for all $\\phi$).\n\nUsing only first principles of flux-weighted RV centroids and the above intensity law, derive the closed-form analytic expression for the semi-amplitude $K_{\\text{RV}}$ of the fundamental (one-per-rotation) harmonic of the RV variation induced by the spot, as a function of $f$, $u$, $\\chi$, $\\ell$, $i$, and $v \\sin i$. Express your final answer as a single closed-form expression. No numerical evaluation is required, and no rounding is necessary. The final answer must be an exact expression.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the semi-amplitude of the fundamental harmonic of the radial velocity (RV) variation induced by a single cool spot on a rotating star. We will derive this from first principles using the provided model parameters.\n\nThe total RV of a star is the flux-weighted average of the line-of-sight velocities over its visible disk. For an unspotted, rigidly rotating star, the RV is zero by symmetry. The presence of a spot, which has a different intensity than the surrounding photosphere, breaks this symmetry and induces a non-zero RV.\n\nThe observed RV, $v_{\\text{RV}}$, can be expressed as the perturbation caused by the spot. In the small-spot approximation ($f \\ll 1$), the change in RV is primarily due to the flux \"missing\" from the spot area, as the spot is darker than the photosphere. The RV induced by the spot is given by the velocity of the missing flux, weighted by the magnitude of this flux deficit, and normalized by the total flux of the immaculate star, $F_{\\star}$.\n\nThe flux deficit from the spot region at a given rotational phase $\\phi$ is $\\Delta F(\\phi)$. The spot has intensity $I_{\\text{spot}}(\\mu) = \\chi I(\\mu)$, where $I(\\mu)$ is the photospheric intensity and $\\chi$ is the spot contrast. The intensity difference is thus $I(\\mu) - I_{\\text{spot}}(\\mu) = (1-\\chi)I(\\mu)$.\nThe physical area of the spot on the stellar surface is $A_{\\text{spot}}$. The problem defines $f$ as the fractional projected area at disk center ($\\mu=1$), so $A_{\\text{spot}} = f \\pi R^2$. The projected area of the spot at phase $\\phi$ is $\\mathcal{A}_{\\text{p}}(\\phi) = A_{\\text{spot}} \\mu(\\phi) = f \\pi R^2 \\mu(\\phi)$, where $\\mu(\\phi)$ is the cosine of the emission angle for the spot.\n\nFor a small spot, we can treat the intensity and velocity as constant over the spot's projected area. The flux deficit is then:\n$$ \\Delta F(\\phi) = (1-\\chi) I(\\mu(\\phi)) \\mathcal{A}_{\\text{p}}(\\phi) = (1-\\chi) I(\\mu(\\phi)) f \\pi R^2 \\mu(\\phi) $$\nThe RV perturbation is given, to first order in $f$, by:\n$$ v_{\\text{RV}}(\\phi) \\approx - \\frac{\\Delta F(\\phi) \\cdot v_{\\text{loc}}(\\phi)}{F_{\\star}} $$\nThe negative sign indicates that removing flux from a receding part of the star (positive $v_{\\text{loc}}$) causes a net blueshift (negative $v_{\\text{RV}}$), and vice-versa.\n\nWe are given the following expressions:\nLocal line-of-sight velocity at the spot: $v_{\\text{loc}}(\\phi) = (v \\sin i)\\, \\cos \\ell \\, \\sin \\phi$\nLimb-darkening law: $I(\\mu) = I_{c}\\,[1 - u (1 - \\mu)] = I_c[1 - u + u\\mu]$\nTotal unspotted stellar flux: $F_{\\star} = \\pi R^{2} I_{c} (1 - u/3)$\nSpot projection factor: $\\mu(\\phi) = \\cos \\ell \\cos \\phi \\sin i + \\sin \\ell \\cos i$\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $v_{\\text{RV}}(\\phi)$:\n$$ v_{\\text{RV}}(\\phi) = - \\frac{(1-\\chi) \\{I_c[1 - u + u\\mu(\\phi)]\\} \\{f \\pi R^2 \\mu(\\phi)\\} \\{(v \\sin i) \\cos \\ell \\sin \\phi\\}}{\\pi R^{2} I_{c} (1 - u/3)} $$\nCanceling common terms ($I_c$, $\\pi R^2$):\n$$ v_{\\text{RV}}(\\phi) = - f(1-\\chi) \\frac{(v \\sin i) \\cos \\ell}{1 - u/3} \\sin\\phi \\, [1 - u + u\\mu(\\phi)] \\mu(\\phi) $$\n$$ v_{\\text{RV}}(\\phi) = - f(1-\\chi) \\frac{(v \\sin i) \\cos \\ell}{1 - u/3} \\sin\\phi \\, [(1-u)\\mu(\\phi) + u\\mu(\\phi)^2] $$\nLet's define a constant prefactor $C$:\n$$ C = - f(1-\\chi) \\frac{(v \\sin i) \\cos \\ell}{1 - u/3} $$\nThen, $v_{\\text{RV}}(\\phi) = C \\sin\\phi \\, [(1-u)\\mu(\\phi) + u\\mu(\\phi)^2]$.\n\nWe need to find the semi-amplitude of the fundamental harmonic of $v_{\\text{RV}}(\\phi)$. This is the amplitude of the term with frequency $1$ per rotation (i.e., terms in $\\sin\\phi$ and $\\cos\\phi$). The RV variation is an odd function of $\\phi$ because it is a product of $v_{\\text{loc}}(\\phi) \\propto \\sin\\phi$ (odd) and a flux term that depends on $\\mu(\\phi) \\propto \\cos\\phi$ (even). An odd function's Fourier series contains only sine terms.

The prefactor $C$ is negative since all its components are positive. The term in the brackets is non-negative since $u \\in [0,1]$, $A_1$, and $B_1$ are constructed from sines and cosines of angles in $[0, \\pi/2]$. Thus, the term is $\\ge 0$.\nSo, $K_{\\text{RV}} = -C \\left[ (1-u)B_1 + uB_1^2 + \\frac{uA_1^2}{4} \\right]$.\n$$ K_{\\text{RV}} = f(1-\\chi) \\frac{(v \\sin i) \\cos \\ell}{1 - u/3} \\left[ (1-u)B_1 + uB_1^2 + \\frac{uA_1^2}{4} \\right] $$\nSubstituting back $A_1 = \\cos\\ell \\sin i$ and $B_1 = \\sin\\ell \\cos i$:\n$$ K_{\\text{RV}} = f(1-\\chi) \\frac{(v \\sin i) \\cos \\ell}{1 - u/3} \\left[ (1-u)(\\sin\\ell \\cos i) + u(\\sin\\ell \\cos i)^2 + \\frac{u}{4}(\\cos\\ell \\sin i)^2 \\right] $$\nThis can be written as the final closed-form expression:\n$$ K_{\\text{RV}} = f (1-\\chi) \\frac{v \\sin i \\cos \\ell}{1 - u/3} \\left[ (1-u)\\sin\\ell \\cos i + u\\sin^2\\ell \\cos^2 i + \\frac{u}{4}\\cos^2\\ell \\sin^2 i \\right] $$\nThis expression gives the semi-amplitude of the fundamental harmonic of the spot-induced RV signal as a function of the required parameters.",

The variance of a single exposure-averaged measurement is $\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{x}_{\\mathrm{osc}}) = \\mathbb{E}[\\bar{x}_{\\mathrm{osc}}^2] = (A_{\\mathrm{osc}}\\,\\mathrm{sinc}(\\pi f_0 T))^2 \\mathbb{E}[\\cos^2(\\phi+\\pi f_0 T)]$. The expectation of $\\cos^2$ over a uniform phase is $\\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, $\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{x}_{\\mathrm{osc}}) = \\frac{1}{2}A_{\\mathrm{osc}}^2\\,\\mathrm{sinc}^2(\\pi f_0 T)$.\n    The phases are independent between exposures, so the $E$ measurements are independent. The variance of the nightly average is reduced by a factor of $E$.\n    $$ \\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{osc, night}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{x}_{\\mathrm{osc}})}{E} = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{osc}}^2}{2E} \\left( \\frac{\\sin(\\pi f_0 T)}{\\pi f_0 T} \\right)^2 $$\n    Substituting the given values: $A_{\\mathrm{osc}}=0.5\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, $E=4$, $T=900\\,\\mathrm{s}$, and $f_0=3.1\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n    The argument of the sinc function is $\\pi f_0 T = \\pi (3.1\\times 10^{-3})(900) = 2.79\\pi$.\n    $$ \\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{osc, night}} = \\frac{(0.5)^2}{2(4)} \\left( \\frac{\\sin(2.79\\pi)}{2.79\\pi} \\right)^2 \\approx 0.0001566\\,\\mathrm{(m/s)^2} $$\n\n2.  **Granulation (short-timescale, $\\mathrm{Var}_{g,1, \\mathrm{night}}$)**\n    For an OU process, the variance of the time-averaged signal over a single exposure is given. Since the exposures are independent ($\\tau_{g,1}=250\\,\\mathrm{s}$ is less than the intra-night cadence), the nightly variance is this single-exposure variance divided by $E$.\n    $$ \\mathrm{Var}_{g,1, \\mathrm{night}} = \\frac{1}{E}\\left[\\frac{2\\sigma_{g,1}^2\\tau_{g,1}}{T}-\\frac{2\\sigma_{g,1}^2\\tau_{g,1}^2}{T^2}\\left(1-\\exp\\left(-\\frac{T}{\\tau_{g,1}}\\right)\\right)\\right] $$\n    Substituting $\\sigma_{g,1}=0.8\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, $\\tau_{g,1}=250\\,\\mathrm{s}$, $T=900\\,\\mathrm{s}$, and $E=4$. The ratio is $T/\\tau_{g,1} = 900/250 = 3.6$.\n    $$ \\mathrm{Var}_{g,1, \\mathrm{night}} = \\frac{1}{4}\\left[\\frac{2(0.8)^2(250)}{900}-\\frac{2(0.8)^2(250)^2}{900^2}\\left(1-\\exp(-3.6)\\right)\\right] $$\n    $$ \\mathrm{Var}_{g,1, \\mathrm{night}} = \\frac{1}{4}\\left[\\frac{320}{900}-\\frac{80000}{810000}\\left(1-\\exp(-3.6)\\right)\\right] \\approx 0.064873\\,\\mathrm{(m/s)^2} $$\n\n3.  **Supergranulation (long-timescale, $\\mathrm{Var}_{g,2, \\mathrm{night}}$)**\n    The correlation time $\\tau_{g,2}=2.0\\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{s}$ is much longer than the duration of the nightly observing sequence. Thus, the signal is perfectly correlated across the $E=4$ exposures. Averaging does not reduce the variance. The nightly variance is simply the variance of a single time-averaged exposure.\n    $$ \\mathrm{Var}_{g,2, \\mathrm{night}} = \\frac{2\\sigma_{g,2}^2\\tau_{g,2}}{T}-\\frac{2\\sigma_{g,2}^2\\tau_{g,2}^2}{T^2}\\left(1-\\exp\\left(-\\frac{T}{\\tau_{g,2}}\\right)\\right) $$\n    Substituting $\\sigma_{g,2}=0.6\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, $\\tau_{g,2}=2.0\\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{s}$, and $T=900\\,\\mathrm{s}$. The ratio is $T/\\tau_{g,2} = 900/20000 = 0.045$.\n    $$ \\mathrm{Var}_{g,2, \\mathrm{night}} = \\frac{2(0.6)^2(20000)}{900} - \\frac{2(0.6)^2(20000)^2}{900^2}\\left(1-\\exp(-0.045)\\right) $$\n    $$ \\mathrm{Var}_{g,2, \\mathrm{night}} = 16 - \\frac{3200}{9}\\left(1-\\exp(-0.045)\\right) \\approx 0.35445\\,\\mathrm{(m/s)^2} $$\n\n4.  **Spots and Faculae ($\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{spot, night}}$)**\n    The correlation time $\\tau_{\\mathrm{spot}} \\gg 1$ day is much larger than the observing timescales ($T$ and the nightly window). The signal is effectively constant over the night. Time-averaging over $T$ or averaging the $E$ exposures does not reduce the variance. The nightly variance is equal to the intrinsic variance of the process.\n    $$ \\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{spot, night}} = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{spot}}^2 = (1.2)^2 = 1.44\\,\\mathrm{(m/s)^2} $$\n\n5.  **Magnetic Cycle ($\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{cyc, night}}$)**\n    Similar to spots, the correlation time $\\tau_{\\mathrm{cyc}} \\gg 1$ year is much larger than the observing timescales. The nightly variance is the intrinsic variance.\n    $$ \\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{cyc, night}} = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{cyc}}^2 = (1.0)^2 = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{(m/s)^2} $$\n\n**Total Nightly RV RMS**\nThe total variance is the sum of the individual variances, as the components are independent.\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{total, night}} = \\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{osc, night}} + \\mathrm{Var}_{g,1, \\mathrm{night}} + \\mathrm{Var}_{g,2, \\mathrm{night}} + \\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{spot, night}} + \\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{cyc, night}} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{total, night}} \\approx 0.0001566 + 0.064873 + 0.35445 + 1.44 + 1.0 = 2.8594796\\,\\mathrm{(m/s)^2} $$\nThe total nightly RMS is the square root of the total variance.\n$$ \\mathrm{RMS}_{\\mathrm{total, night}} = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mathrm{total, night}}} \\approx \\sqrt{2.8594796} \\approx 1.691005\\,\\mathrm{m/s} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the total nightly RV RMS noise is $1.69\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$.",
