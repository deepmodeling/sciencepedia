All necessary physical constants and parameters are provided, and the scenario described—investigating spectral line broadening mechanisms for carbon monoxide in a hot Jupiter atmosphere—is a standard and realistic problem in astrophysics and planetary science. The underlying physics concerning natural and Doppler broadening is fundamental and correctly invoked. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the calculation of the natural broadening widths (half width at half maximum, $\\gamma$, and full width at half maximum, $2\\gamma$) and an assessment of their magnitude relative to the thermal Doppler broadening width for a specific rovibrational transition of carbon monoxide ($CO$).\n\n### Part 1: Natural Broadening\n\nNatural broadening, also known as radiative broadening, is a homogeneous broadening mechanism that arises from the finite lifetime of an excited quantum state due to spontaneous emission. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle dictates a relationship between the lifetime of a state, $\\tau$, and the uncertainty in its energy, $\\Delta E$, given by $\\Delta E \\cdot \\tau \\approx \\hbar$. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the resulting Lorentzian spectral line profile, when expressed in energy units, is $\\Gamma_E = \\Delta E = \\hbar/\\tau$.\n\nThe lifetime of the upper state, $\\tau_{ul}$, is the reciprocal of the total spontaneous emission rate from that state. In this problem, we consider a single transition with an Einstein coefficient for spontaneous emission $A_{ul}$. Thus, the lifetime is $\\tau_{ul} = 1/A_{ul}$.\n\nThe FWHM, expressed in units of angular frequency ($\\mathrm{rad\\,s}^{-1}$), is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta\\omega = \\frac{1}{\\tau_{ul}} = A_{ul}\n$$\nThe problem requests the widths in ordinary frequency, $\\nu$, measured in Hertz ($Hz$), and in wavenumber, $\\sigma$, measured in inverse centimeters ($cm^{-1}$). The relationship between angular frequency and ordinary frequency is $\\omega = 2\\pi\\nu$. Therefore, the FWHM in Hertz is:\n$$\n2\\gamma_{\\nu} = \\Delta\\nu = \\frac{\\Delta\\omega}{2\\pi} = \\frac{A_{ul}}{2\\pi}\n$$\nThe half width at half maximum (HWHM) in Hertz is:\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\nu} = \\frac{2\\gamma_{\\nu}}{2} = \\frac{A_{ul}}{4\\pi}\n$$\nUsing the given value $A_{ul} = 1.0 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$:\n$$\n2\\gamma_{\\nu} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{2\\pi} \\approx 1.591549 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{Hz}\n$$\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\nu} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{4\\pi} \\approx 7.957747 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{Hz}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required:\n$2\\gamma_{\\nu} \\approx 1.592 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$\n$\\gamma_{\\nu} \\approx 7.958 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$\n\nTo convert from frequency ($\\nu$) to wavenumber ($\\sigma$), we use the relation $\\nu = c\\sigma$, where $c$ is the speed of light.

Under these conditions of a high-temperature atmosphere and in the infrared spectral region, Doppler broadening is the dominant broadening mechanism.

For a single isolated transition at line-center frequency $\\nu_0$, assume the macroscopic velocity field is negligible and that the line profile is the convolution of a thermal Gaussian and a collisional Lorentzian (a Voigt profile).\n\nStarting from foundational principles and well-tested facts, use the following base definitions:\n\n- Maxwell–Boltzmann thermal motion in one dimension gives a Gaussian velocity distribution with variance $\\sigma_v^2 = k_{\\mathrm{B}} T / m$, where $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is temperature, and $m$ is the molecular mass.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard problem in astrophysical spectroscopy that can be solved using established physical principles and numerical methods.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first defining the line broadening mechanisms, then detailing the implementation of both an approximate and a numerically exact method for calculating the Voigt profile's Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM), and finally computing the relative error between these two methods for each test case.\n\n**1. Foundational Quantities: Doppler and Collisional Widths**\n\nThe total line shape is a Voigt profile, resulting from the convolution of a Gaussian profile due to thermal motion and a Lorentzian profile due to collisional interactions.\n\n**Thermal (Doppler) Broadening:**\nThe random thermal motion of molecules along the line of sight leads to Doppler shifts, creating a Gaussian line profile. The characteristic width is given as the one-over-$e$ half-width, $\\Delta\\nu_D$, which is calculated from first principles:\n$$\n\\Delta\\nu_D = \\frac{\\nu_0}{c} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{m}}\n$$\nwhere $\\nu_0$ is the line-center frequency, $c$ is the speed of light, $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the temperature, and $m$ is the molecular mass.\nThe corresponding Gaussian profile is $G(\\nu) \\propto \\exp(-(\\nu-\\nu_0)^2/\\Delta\\nu_D^2)$. The standard deviation of this Gaussian distribution is $\\sigma = \\Delta\\nu_D / \\sqrt{2}$. The Full Width at Half Maximum of the Gaussian component, $FWHM_G$, is related to $\\Delta\\nu_D$ by:\n$$\nFWHM_G = 2\\sqrt{2\\ln(2)}\\,\\sigma = 2\\sqrt{\\ln 2}\\,\\Delta\\nu_D \\approx 1.6651\\,\\Delta\\nu_D\n$$\n\n**Collisional (Pressure) Broadening:**\nIntermolecular collisions interrupt the emission/absorption process, leading to a Lorentzian line profile. The model for the Lorentzian Half Width at Half Maximum (HWHM), $\\gamma$, is given by a pressure and temperature-dependent relation:\n$$\n\\gamma(T,p) = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\left(\\frac{p}{p_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{T}\\right)^{n}\n$$\nwhere ($\\gamma_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, $p_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, $T_{\\mathrm{ref}}$) are reference values and $n$ is the temperature-dependence exponent. The FWHM of the Lorentzian component, $FWHM_L$, is simply twice the HWHM:\n$$\nFWHM_L = 2\\gamma\n$$\n\n**2. Semi-Empirical Approximation for the Voigt FWHM**\n\nThe FWHM of the Voigt profile, $FWHM_V$, cannot be expressed in a simple closed form. However, several accurate semi-empirical approximations exist. The Whiting (1968) approximation is a widely used and accurate formula that combines the Gaussian and Lorentzian FWHMs:\n$$\nFWHM_{approx} = 0.5346\\,FWHM_L + \\sqrt{0.2166\\,FWHM_L^2 + FWHM_G^2}\n$$\nThis formula provides an estimate of the Voigt FWHM directly from the component widths, $FWHM_G$ and $FWHM_L$, and will be used as the specified approximation.\n\n**3. Numerical Computation of the Exact Voigt FWHM**\n\nThe \"exact\" FWHM is determined by numerically analyzing the Voigt profile itself. The process involves three main steps:\n\n**Step 3.1: Voigt Profile Evaluation**\nThe Voigt profile $V(x; \\sigma, \\gamma)$ is the convolution of a Gaussian with standard deviation $\\sigma$ and a Lorentzian with HWHM $\\gamma$, where $x=\\nu-\\nu_0$ is the frequency offset from the line center. Direct computation of the convolution integral is inefficient. A standard, high-precision method relies on its relation to the complex error function (Faddeeva function). The `scipy.special.voigt_profile` function provides an optimized implementation for this, which we use for accurate evaluation. The inputs are the Gaussian standard deviation $\\sigma = \\Delta\\nu_D/\\sqrt{2}$ and the Lorentzian HWHM $\\gamma$.\n\n**Step 3.2: Finding the Half-Maximum Points**\nThe Voigt profile is symmetric and peaks at $x=0$. The peak value is $V_{max} = V(0; \\sigma, \\gamma)$. The FWHM is defined as $2x_{1/2}$, where $x_{1/2}$ is the positive offset at which the profile's value is half its maximum:\n$$\nV(x_{1/2}; \\sigma, \\gamma) = \\frac{1}{2} V_{max}\n$$\nTo find $x_{1/2}$, we must find the root of the function $f(x) = V(x; \\sigma, \\gamma) - V_{max}/2 = 0$.\n\n**Step 3.3: Numerical Root-Finding**\nA robust numerical root-finding algorithm is required. The `scipy.optimize.brentq` algorithm is ideal for this task. It requires the root to be bracketed, i.e., finding an interval $[a, b]$ where $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ have opposite signs. Since $f(0) = V_{max}/2 > 0$ and $f(x) \\to -V_{max}/2$ as $x \\to \\infty$, a root is guaranteed to exist for $x > 0$. A suitable search bracket can be established starting from a small positive value and extending to a value several times the characteristic widths, ensuring the function becomes negative. Once $x_{1/2}$ is found with high precision, the exact FWHM is $FWHM_{exact} = 2x_{1/2}$.\n\nA special case is the collisionless limit ($p=0$), where $\\gamma=0$.

The spectroscopic line-shape used in retrievals is the Voigt profile, which is the convolution of a Gaussian and a Lorentzian. The normalized line-shape must satisfy the normalization condition that its integral over all frequency is unity.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definition that a physically valid line-shape function is a real, nonnegative function whose integral over all frequency is unity, and the core fact that the Voigt profile is the convolution of the Doppler-broadened Gaussian and the pressure-broadened Lorentzian, implement a numerically stable evaluation using the complex error function (the Faddeeva function). Use the dimensionless damping parameter $a$ commonly used in exoplanet retrievals, defined by the ratio of the Lorentzian half-width at half-maximum to the Gaussian width in Doppler units. Demonstrate numerically that the Voigt profile $\\phi_{V}$ is normalized via\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\phi_{V}(\\nu)\\,d\\nu = 1,\n$$\nby expressing the integral in terms of a dimensionless frequency coordinate and the Faddeeva function evaluation, and performing numerical integration over the entire real line.

            "solution": "The problem statement is valid. It presents a well-posed, scientifically grounded computational task based on established principles of spectroscopy and radiative transfer. The objective is to numerically verify the normalization property of the Voigt line-shape profile, a standard model in astrophysics, using a specified stable numerical method. All necessary definitions, parameters, and constraints are provided.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the correct formulation and numerical integration of the Voigt profile. The Voigt profile, $\\phi_V$, arises from the convolution of a Gaussian profile (modeling thermal or Doppler broadening) and a Lorentzian profile (modeling collisional or pressure broadening). Its normalization is a fundamental physical requirement, stating that the total probability of photon absorption or emission across all frequencies, represented by the integral of the line-shape function, must be unity.\n\nLet the line center frequency be $\\nu_0$. The Doppler-broadened Gaussian profile, normalized with respect to frequency $\\nu$, is given by:\n$$\n\\phi_G(\\nu) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha_D \\sqrt{\\pi}} \\exp\\left( - \\left( \\frac{\\nu - \\nu_0}{\\alpha_D} \\right)^2 \\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha_D$ is the Doppler width. The pressure-broadened Lorentzian profile, also normalized with respect to $\\nu$, is:\n$$\n\\phi_L(\\nu) = \\frac{\\gamma_L / \\pi}{(\\nu - \\nu_0)^2 + \\gamma_L^2}\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma_L$ is the Lorentzian half-width at half-maximum (HWHM).\n\nThe Voigt profile $\\phi_V(\\nu)$ is the convolution $(\\phi_G * \\phi_L)(\\nu)$. A key property of convolution is that the integral of the convolved function is the product of the integrals of the original functions. Since both $\\phi_G(\\nu)$ and $\\phi_L(\\nu)$ are normalized to $1$ over all $\\nu$, their convolution $\\phi_V(\\nu)$ is also normalized:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\phi_V(\\nu)\\,d\\nu = \\left(\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\phi_G(\\nu)\\,d\\nu\\right) \\left(\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\phi_L(\\nu)\\,d\\nu\\right) = 1 \\times 1 = 1\n$$\nThe problem requires working with dimensionless coordinates. We define a dimensionless frequency coordinate $x$ and a dimensionless damping parameter $a$:\n$$\nx = \\frac{\\nu - \\nu_0}{\\alpha_D} \\quad , \\quad a = \\frac{\\gamma_L}{\\alpha_D}\n$$\nThe relationship between the frequency differential $d\\nu$ and the dimensionless differential $dx$ is $d\\nu = \\alpha_D dx$. The normalization condition can be rewritten in terms of $x$:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\phi_V(\\nu)\\,d\\nu = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\phi_V(x) (\\alpha_D dx) = 1\n$$\nThis implies that the function to be integrated with respect to $x$ is not $\\phi_V(\\nu)$ itself, but a rescaled version, which we will denote $\\phi_V(x,a)$, such that $\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\phi_V(x,a)\\,dx = 1$. The function $\\phi_V(x,a)$ is therefore $\\alpha_D \\phi_V(\\nu)$.\n\nTo find an expression for $\\phi_V(x,a)$, we express the convolution integral in dimensionless coordinates. This leads to the Voigt function, commonly denoted $V(x,a)$ or $H(a,x)$:\n$$\nV(x,a) = \\frac{a}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\frac{e^{-y^2}}{(x-y)^2 + a^2} dy\n$$\nThis function is directly related to the real part of the Faddeeva function (or complex error function) $w(z)$, which is defined as $w(z) = e^{-z^2}\\text{erfc}(-iz)$. For a complex argument $z = x+ia$ with $a>0$, the Faddeeva function can be expressed as:\n$$\nw(x+ia) = \\frac{i}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\frac{e^{-t^2}}{(x-t)+ia} dt = \\text{Re}[w(x+ia)] + i\\,\\text{Im}[w(x+ia)]\n$$\nThe real part evaluates to:\n$$\n\\text{Re}[w(x+ia)] = \\frac{a}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\frac{e^{-t^2}}{(x-t)^2 + a^2} dt = V(x,a)\n$$\nThe relationship between the physically normalized profile $\\phi_V(\\nu)$ and $V(x,a)$ is $\\phi_V(\\nu) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha_D \\sqrt{\\pi}} V(x,a)$. The dimensionless profile $\\phi_V(x,a)$ we seek is therefore:\n$$\n\\phi_V(x,a) = \\alpha_D \\phi_V(\\nu) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} V(x,a) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\text{Re}[w(x+ia)]\n$$\nThis is the function whose integral over $x$ from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$ should equal $1$.\n\nThe numerical implementation proceeds as follows:\n1.  Define a Python function, `normalized_voigt_profile(x, a)`, that computes $\\phi_V(x,a) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\text{Re}[w(x+ia)]$. The Faddeeva function $w(z)$ is provided by `scipy.special.wofz`.\n2.  For each damping parameter $a$ in the test suite $[\\,0,\\;10^{-6},\\;10^{-4},\\;10^{-3},\\;10^{-2},\\;5\\times 10^{-2},\\;10^{-1},\\;3\\times 10^{-1},\\;1\\,]$, perform a numerical integration of `normalized_voigt_profile(x, a)` with respect to $x$ over the interval $(-\\infty, +\\infty)$. This is accomplished using `scipy.integrate.quad`, a robust numerical quadrature routine that supports infinite limits.\n3.  For each integral result $I(a)$, calculate the absolute deviation from the theoretical value of $1$, i.e., $|I(a) - 1|$. This error quantifies the combined effect of floating-point precision limitations and the numerical accuracy of the integration algorithm.\n4.  The resulting list of absolute errors is formatted into the specified output string. The case $a=0$ represents a pure Gaussian profile, for which $V(x,0) = e^{-x^2}$ and $\\phi_V(x,0) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}e^{-x^2}$, whose integral is exactly $1$. The numerical procedure should confirm this with high accuracy.",
