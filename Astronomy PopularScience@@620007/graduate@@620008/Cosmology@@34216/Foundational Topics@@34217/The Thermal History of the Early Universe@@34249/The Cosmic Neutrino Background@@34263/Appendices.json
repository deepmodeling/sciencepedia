This exercise [@problem_id:860680] challenges you to calculate this ratio in a hypothetical universe with an extra particle species, forcing a first-principles application of entropy conservation and cementing your understanding of how the particle content of the early universe dictates its thermal history.", "problem": "In cosmology, the temperature ratio of the cosmic neutrino background (C$\\nu$B) to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is a key prediction of the Hot Big Bang model. This ratio is determined by the entropy transfer from particle-antiparticle annihilation to the photon bath after neutrinos have decoupled from the primordial plasma.\n\nConsider a hypothetical universe that, at temperatures $T \\gg 1 \\text{ GeV}$, contains the same particle species as the Standard Model, plus an additional fundamental particle: a spin-1/2 charged lepton called the `tau-prime` ($\\tau'$) and its antiparticle. The mass hierarchy of the charged leptons is $m_e < m_\\mu < m_{\\tau'}$. In this universe, we work in natural units where $\\hbar = c = k_B = 1$. The effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom for entropy for a particle species $i$ is denoted by $g_{*,s,i}$. The total for a plasma in thermal equilibrium at temperature T is $g_{*,s} = \\sum_i g_{*,s,i}$, where for bosons $g_{*,s,i} = g_i$ and for fermions $g_{*,s,i} = \\frac{7}{8} g_i$, with $g_i$ being the number of internal degrees of freedom.\n\nThe relevant particle species and their internal degrees of freedom ($g_i$) are:\n-   Photons ($\\gamma$): Relativistic bosons with $g_\\gamma = 2$.\n-   Three families of neutrinos and anti-neutrinos ($\\nu_e, \\nu_\\mu, \\nu_\\tau$): Relativistic fermions with a total of $g_\\nu = 6$.\n-   Electrons and positrons ($e^\\pm$): Fermions with $g_e = 4$.\n-   Muons and anti-muons ($\\mu^\\pm$): Fermions with $g_\\mu = 4$.\n-   Tau-primes and anti-tau-primes ($\\tau'^\\pm$): Fermions with $g_{\\tau'} = 4$.\n\nAssume that in this universe, due to a different strength of the weak interaction, neutrino decoupling occurs at a temperature $T_D$ that is significantly higher than the mass of the tau-prime lepton, i.e., $T_D \\gg m_{\\tau'}$. Consequently, after the neutrinos decouple, the sequential annihilation of $\\tau'^\\pm$, $\\mu^\\pm$, and $e^\\pm$ pairs occurs, transferring their entropy only to the photon-lepton plasma they are still coupled to.\n\nCalculate the final ratio of the neutrino temperature to the photon temperature, $T_\\nu/T_\\gamma$, long after all charged lepton pairs (including $e^\\pm$) have annihilated.", "solution": "The solution to this problem hinges on the principle of entropy conservation in a comoving volume. The entropy of the plasma and the entropy of the neutrino sector are conserved separately after the neutrinos decouple.\n\n**1. Entropy Conservation**\n\nThe entropy density, $s$, of a gas of relativistic particles in thermal equilibrium at temperature $T$ is given by:\n$$s = \\frac{2\\pi^2}{45} g_{*,s} T^3$$\nwhere $g_{*,s}$ is the total effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom for entropy. For a system that evolves adiabatically, the total entropy in a comoving volume, $S = s a^3$ (where $a$ is the scale factor), is conserved. This implies that the quantity $g_{*,s} (T a)^3$ remains constant for a set of coupled species.\n\n**2. State of the Universe at Two Key Epochs**\n\nWe need to compare the state of the universe at two critical epochs:\n-   **Epoch 1 (Initial State):** Just after neutrino decoupling at $T=T_D$, but before any of the charged lepton-antilepton pairs annihilate. In this epoch, the neutrinos have just decoupled and their temperature $T_\\nu$ is equal to the photon temperature $T_\\gamma$. The plasma consists of photons ($\\gamma$), electrons ($e^\\pm$), muons ($\\mu^\\pm$), and tau-primes ($\\tau'^\\pm$), all in thermal equilibrium.\n-   **Epoch 2 (Final State):** Long after all charged lepton pairs ($\\tau'^\\pm, \\mu^\\pm, e^\\pm$) have annihilated. In this epoch, the plasma consists only of photons, while the neutrinos form a separate, cooler background.\n\n**3. Evolution of Neutrino and Photon Temperatures**\n\nAfter decoupling, the neutrinos are no longer interacting with the plasma. Their number in a comoving volume is fixed, and their temperature simply redshifts with the expansion of the universe as $T_\\nu \\propto 1/a$. Therefore, the quantity $(T_\\nu a)$ is a constant throughout the subsequent evolution.\n$$(T_\\nu a)_{\\text{final}} = (T_\\nu a)_{\\text{initial}}$$\n\nFor the plasma (photons and charged leptons), the entropy in a comoving volume is conserved through the annihilations. Let $T_\\gamma$ be the temperature of this plasma.\n$$S_{\\text{plasma}} = s_{\\text{plasma}} a^3 = \\frac{2\\pi^2}{45} g_{*,s}^{\\text{plasma}} (T_\\gamma a)^3 = \\text{constant}$$\nThis implies:\n$$(g_{*,s}^{\\text{plasma}})_{\\text{initial}} (T_\\gamma a)_{\\text{initial}}^3 = (g_{*,s}^{\\text{plasma}})_{\\text{final}} (T_\\gamma a)_{\\text{final}}^3$$\n\n**4. Calculating the Degrees of Freedom**\n\nLet's calculate the effective degrees of freedom for the plasma at the initial and final epochs.\n\n-   **Initial State (Epoch 1):** The plasma contains photons, electrons, muons, and tau-primes.\n    $$(g_{*,s}^{\\text{plasma}})_{\\text{initial}} = g_{*,s}(\\gamma) + g_{*,s}(e^\\pm) + g_{*,s}(\\mu^\\pm) + g_{*,s}(\\tau'^\\pm)$$\n    Using the given values ($g_\\gamma = 2$, $g_e=g_\\mu=g_{\\tau'}=4$) and the formulas for bosons and fermions:\n    $$(g_{*,s}^{\\text{plasma}})_{\\text{initial}} = g_\\gamma + \\frac{7}{8}(g_e + g_\\mu + g_{\\tau'}) = 2 + \\frac{7}{8}(4 + 4 + 4) = 2 + \\frac{7}{8}(12) = 2 + \\frac{21}{2} = \\frac{4+21}{2} = \\frac{25}{2}$$\n\n-   **Final State (Epoch 2):** After all annihilations, the plasma consists only of photons.\n    $$(g_{*,s}^{\\text{plasma}})_{\\text{final}} = g_{*,s}(\\gamma) = g_\\gamma = 2$$\n\n**5. Deriving the Temperature Ratio**\n\nFrom the conservation of plasma entropy, we can write:\n$$(T_\\gamma a)_{\\text{final}} = \\left( \\frac{(g_{*,s}^{\\text{plasma}})_{\\text{initial}}}{(g_{*,s}^{\\text{plasma}})_{\\text{final}}} \\right)^{1/3} (T_\\gamma a)_{\\text{initial}}$$\n\nThe final temperature ratio $T_\\nu/T_\\gamma$ is what we want to find. We can express this as:\n$$\\frac{T_{\\nu, \\text{final}}}{T_{\\gamma, \\text{final}}} = \\frac{(T_\\nu a)_{\\text{final}} / a_{\\text{final}}}{(T_\\gamma a)_{\\text{final}} / a_{\\text{final}}} = \\frac{(T_\\nu a)_{\\text{final}}}{(T_\\gamma a)_{\\text{final}}}$$\n\nWe know that $(T_\\nu a)_{\\text{final}} = (T_\\nu a)_{\\text{initial}}$. At the initial epoch (just after decoupling), $T_{\\nu, \\text{initial}} = T_{\\gamma, \\text{initial}}$. Therefore, $(T_\\nu a)_{\\text{initial}} = (T_\\gamma a)_{\\text{initial}}$.\n\nSubstituting these relations into the ratio equation:\n$$\\frac{T_\\nu}{T_\\gamma} = \\frac{(T_\\gamma a)_{\\text{initial}}}{(T_\\gamma a)_{\\text{final}}} = \\left( \\frac{(g_{*,s}^{\\text{plasma}})_{\\text{final}}}{(g_{*,s}^{\\text{plasma}})_{\\text{initial}}} \\right)^{1/3}$$\n\nPlugging in the calculated values for the degrees of freedom:\n$$\\frac{T_\\nu}{T_\\gamma} = \\left( \\frac{2}{25/2} \\right)^{1/3} = \\left( \\frac{4}{25} \\right)^{1/3}$$\n\nThis is the final ratio of the neutrino temperature to the photon temperature.
