## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

The First and Second Orthogonality Relations form the bedrock of [character theory](@entry_id:144021). While the first relation, concerning the rows of the character table, is fundamental for decomposing representations, it is the [second orthogonality relation](@entry_id:137603), concerning the columns, that provides a direct and powerful bridge between the abstract world of representations and the concrete structural properties of the group itself. In this chapter, we transition from the theoretical underpinnings of this relation to its practical applications. We will explore how a simple-looking summation formula unlocks profound insights into the internal architecture of a group, allowing us to compute [structural invariants](@entry_id:145830), test for conjugacy, and even solve complex combinatorial problems, all from the arithmetic data encoded in the character table.

The utility of this relation extends beyond core group theory, revealing deep connections to other areas of mathematics. We will see how it manifests as a fundamental principle in the study of group algebras, serves as a cornerstone of Fourier analysis on [finite abelian groups](@entry_id:136632), and even generalizes to the more advanced context of [modular representation theory](@entry_id:147491). By examining these applications, we will appreciate the [second orthogonality relation](@entry_id:137603) not merely as a mathematical curiosity, but as an indispensable computational tool and a unifying conceptual thread.

### Probing Group Structure: Centralizers and Conjugacy

The most immediate applications of the [second orthogonality relation](@entry_id:137603) are in the structural analysis of a [finite group](@entry_id:151756). The columns of a [character table](@entry_id:145187), indexed by the [conjugacy classes](@entry_id:143916), hold the key to determining the size of centralizers and, by extension, the sizes of the classes themselves.

#### Calculating the Size of Centralizers and Conjugacy Classes

A [centralizer of an element](@entry_id:143269) $g \in G$, denoted $C_G(g)$, is a subgroup whose order measures the "[commutativity](@entry_id:140240)" surrounding $g$. A direct consequence of the [second orthogonality relation](@entry_id:137603) is a remarkable formula for its size. For any element $g \in G$, the order of its centralizer is given by the sum of the squared moduli of the character values in the column corresponding to its conjugacy class:
$$ |C_G(g)| = \sum_{i=1}^{k} |\chi_i(g)|^2 $$
where the sum is over all [irreducible characters](@entry_id:145398) $\chi_i$ of $G$.

This formula is a powerful computational device. To find the size of the [centralizer of an element](@entry_id:143269), one does not need to perform a brute-force search for all commuting elements. Instead, one simply reads the appropriate column from the group's character table and computes a [sum of squares](@entry_id:161049). For example, in the [symmetric group](@entry_id:142255) $S_4$, we can determine the size of the centralizer of a 4-cycle, such as $g = (1 2 3 4)$. By summing the squares of the character values in the corresponding column of the $S_4$ character table—which are $\{1, -1, -1, 1, 0\}$—we find $|C_{S_4}(g)| = 1^2 + (-1)^2 + (-1)^2 + 1^2 + 0^2 = 4$. The centralizer is a [cyclic group](@entry_id:146728) of order 4, generated by the 4-cycle itself [@problem_id:767047]. The same principle applies to other well-known groups, such as the [alternating group](@entry_id:140499) $A_5$, where the [centralizer](@entry_id:146604) of a 3-cycle is found to have order 3, and the [dihedral group](@entry_id:143875) $D_4$, where the centralizer of a rotation by $90^\circ$ has order 4 [@problem_id:746825] [@problem_id:766927].

Once the order of the [centralizer](@entry_id:146604) is known, the size of the conjugacy class of $g$, denoted $|Cl(g)|$, is immediately accessible through the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem:
$$ |Cl(g)| = \frac{|G|}{|C_G(g)|} $$
This two-step process—using characters to find $|C_G(g)|$ and then the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem to find $|Cl(g)|$—is extremely efficient. For instance, consider the [special linear group](@entry_id:139538) $G = SL(2, \mathbb{F}_3)$ of order 24. If we are given that the character values for an element $g$ of order 4 are $\{1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1\}$, we can compute $|C_G(g)| = 1^2+1^2+1^2+0^2+0^2+0^2+(-1)^2 = 4$. From this, we deduce that the size of the conjugacy class containing $g$ is $|Cl(g)| = 24 / 4 = 6$ [@problem_id:651296]. This method allows us to deduce class sizes even without full knowledge of the group's [multiplication table](@entry_id:138189), provided a column of its character table is known [@problem_id:766939].

#### A Litmus Test for Conjugacy

The [second orthogonality relation](@entry_id:137603) offers more than just sizes; it provides a definitive test for conjugacy. The full relation states that for any two elements $g, h \in G$:
$$ \sum_{i=1}^{k} \chi_i(g) \overline{\chi_i(h)} = \delta_{Cl(g), Cl(h)} |C_G(g)| $$
where $\delta_{Cl(g), Cl(h)}$ is the Kronecker delta. The crucial insight here is that the sum is zero if and only if $g$ and $h$ are *not* in the same conjugacy class. This gives us an algorithmic test: to determine if $g$ and $h$ are conjugate, compute the sum. A non-zero result confirms they are conjugate, while a zero result proves they are not.

This tool is particularly valuable in situations where [conjugacy](@entry_id:151754) is not immediately obvious. In the [dihedral group](@entry_id:143875) $D_{12}$ (the symmetry group of a 12-gon), the reflections are partitioned into two sets: those whose axes pass through opposite vertices and those whose axes pass through midpoints of opposite edges. Geometric intuition suggests these might be different, but a character-theoretic calculation provides definitive proof. By taking a representative from each set, $s$ and $sr$, and computing the sum $\sum_{\chi} \chi(s)\overline{\chi(sr)}$ using the [character table](@entry_id:145187) of $D_{12}$, the result is found to be zero. This rigorously confirms that these two types of reflections belong to distinct conjugacy classes [@problem_id:767110]. Similarly, one can verify that powers of an element, such as $r^2$ and $r^3$ in $D_{14}$, are not conjugate by showing that the corresponding [character sum](@entry_id:192985) is zero [@problem_id:766963].

The power of this test is further highlighted in more subtle contexts. Consider the 5-cycles in the alternating group $A_5$. All 5-cycles are conjugate within the larger symmetric group $S_5$. However, this is not necessarily true within the subgroup $A_5$. If we take a 5-cycle $g = (12345)$ and conjugate it by an odd permutation, such as $\sigma = (23)$, we obtain another 5-cycle $h = \sigma g \sigma^{-1}$. Since the conjugating element $\sigma$ is not in $A_5$, there is no guarantee that $g$ and $h$ are conjugate *within* $A_5$. The [second orthogonality relation](@entry_id:137603) provides the verdict. Computing the sum $\sum_{\chi \in \operatorname{Irr}(A_5)} \chi(g)\overline{\chi(h)}$ yields zero, proving that the single [conjugacy class](@entry_id:138270) of 5-cycles in $S_5$ splits into two distinct classes within $A_5$ [@problem_id:767105].

### Extending the Principle: Direct Products and Generalizations

The principles of [character theory](@entry_id:144021), including the [second orthogonality relation](@entry_id:137603), extend elegantly to more complex group constructions and even to other branches of representation theory.

#### Character Theory of Direct Products

The [irreducible characters](@entry_id:145398) of a [direct product](@entry_id:143046) group $G_1 \times G_2$ are simply the products of the irreducible characters of the constituent groups. That is, if $\{\psi_i\}$ are the characters of $G_1$ and $\{\phi_j\}$ are the characters of $G_2$, then the characters of $G_1 \times G_2$ are $\{\chi_{ij}(g_1, g_2) = \psi_i(g_1)\phi_j(g_2)\}$. This simple construction allows us to apply the [second orthogonality relation](@entry_id:137603) to direct products seamlessly.

Let's find the order of the centralizer of a "diagonal" element $(g,g)$ in the [product group](@entry_id:276017) $G \times G$. A direct structural argument shows that $C_{G \times G}((g,g)) = C_G(g) \times C_G(g)$, so its order is $|C_G(g)|^2$ [@problem_id:1654194]. We can arrive at the same conclusion using characters, which showcases the internal consistency of the theory. The calculation is as follows:
$$ |C_{G \times G}((g,g))| = \sum_{i,j} |\chi_{ij}((g,g))|^2 = \sum_{i,j} |\psi_i(g)\phi_j(g)|^2 = \sum_{i} |\psi_i(g)|^2 \sum_{j} |\phi_j(g)|^2 $$
Since $\{\psi_i\}$ and $\{\phi_j\}$ are both the set of irreducible characters for $G$, this becomes:
$$ |C_{G \times G}((g,g))| = \left(\sum_{i} |\psi_i(g)|^2\right) \left(\sum_{j} |\phi_j(g)|^2\right) = |C_G(g)| \cdot |C_G(g)| = |C_G(g)|^2 $$
This abstract result can be seen in concrete examples. In the group $S_3 \times C_4$, the [centralizer of an element](@entry_id:143269) $g = (\sigma, a)$, where $\sigma$ is a transposition in $S_3$ and $a$ is a generator of $C_4$, can be computed. The sum of squared character values for $\sigma$ in $S_3$ is $|C_{S_3}(\sigma)| = 2$, and the sum for $a$ in $C_4$ is $|C_{C_4}(a)| = 4$. The centralizer size in the [product group](@entry_id:276017) is thus the product of these individual centralizer sizes: $|C_{S_3 \times C_4}(g)| = 2 \times 4 = 8$ [@problem_id:767109].

#### Connections to Modular Representation Theory

The concept of [character orthogonality](@entry_id:188239) is so fundamental that it reappears, in a modified form, in [modular representation theory](@entry_id:147491). When studying representations over fields of [prime characteristic](@entry_id:155979) $p$, one considers Brauer characters, which are defined only for elements whose order is not divisible by $p$ (the so-called $p$-regular elements).

Remarkably, a [second orthogonality relation](@entry_id:137603) holds for these Brauer characters. The sum is taken over the irreducible Brauer characters $\phi_k$, and the orthogonality is across the $p$-regular conjugacy classes. For a $p$-regular element $h \in H$, the relation is:
$$ \sum_{k} |\phi_k(h)|^2 = |C_H(h)| $$
This demonstrates that the deep connection between character values and centralizer sizes is not an artifact of characteristic zero representations but a more fundamental structural property. Given a hypothetical Brauer character table for a group, one can calculate the centralizer size of any $p$-regular element by summing the squares of the entries in the corresponding column, exactly as one would with an ordinary [character table](@entry_id:145187) [@problem_id:1601439]. This extension highlights the robustness of character-theoretic principles.

### Deeper Applications in Algebra and Combinatorics

The implications of the [second orthogonality relation](@entry_id:137603) extend into the algebraic structure of the [group algebra](@entry_id:145139) and provide sophisticated tools for solving [combinatorial counting](@entry_id:141086) problems within the group.

#### The Structure of the Group Algebra

The center of the [group algebra](@entry_id:145139), $Z(\mathbb{C}[G])$, is a [commutative ring](@entry_id:148075) whose structure is intimately tied to the representation theory of $G$. A natural basis for $Z(\mathbb{C}[G])$ is given by the set of class sums, $\{K_C = \sum_{g \in C} g\}$, where $C$ is a conjugacy class. The product of two class sums can be expressed as a linear combination of other class sums:
$$ K_{C_i} K_{C_j} = \sum_k c_{ijk} K_{C_k} $$
The integers $c_{ijk}$ are called the structure constants of $Z(\mathbb{C}[G])$. These constants can be computed directly from the [character table](@entry_id:145187) using a formula that is a direct consequence of both [orthogonality relations](@entry_id:145540):
$$ c_{ijk} = \frac{|C_i||C_j|}{|G|} \sum_{m=1}^{r} \frac{\chi_m(g_i) \chi_m(g_j) \overline{\chi_m(g_k)}}{\chi_m(e)} $$
where $g_i \in C_i$. This formula provides a stunning connection: the multiplicative structure of the center of the [group algebra](@entry_id:145139) is completely determined by the group's [character table](@entry_id:145187). For instance, using the character table of $A_5$, one can compute the coefficient of the class sum of 3-cycles in the product of the class sum of 5-cycles with itself, finding $c_{442}=3$ [@problem_id:766988].

#### A Bridge to Group Combinatorics

The [structure constants](@entry_id:157960) have a direct combinatorial interpretation: $c_{ijk}$ is precisely the number of pairs $(x,y)$ with $x \in C_i$ and $y \in C_j$ such that their product $xy$ equals a fixed element $g_k \in C_k$. This re-framing turns the formula for $c_{ijk}$ into a powerful counting tool.

For example, if we wish to know how many ways a specific 3-cycle in $A_4$, say $c=(123)$, can be written as a product $hk$ where $h$ is an [involution](@entry_id:203735) (an element of order 2) and $k$ is a 3-cycle, we can use this formula. By applying it to the [character table](@entry_id:145187) of $A_4$, we find the answer to be 3 [@problem_id:767134]. Solving such a problem by direct enumeration would be tedious and error-prone, but [character theory](@entry_id:144021) provides an elegant and systematic solution.

A particularly beautiful application of this line of reasoning is the problem of counting the total number of commuting pairs $(g,h)$ in a group $G$. This quantity is equal to $\sum_{g \in G} |C_G(g)|$. By cleverly manipulating [character sums](@entry_id:189446), one can prove that this is equal to $k \cdot |G|$, where $k$ is the number of [conjugacy classes](@entry_id:143916) of $G$. This provides a global structural invariant of the group. For the group $SL(2,3)$, which has order 24 and 7 [conjugacy classes](@entry_id:143916), the total number of commuting pairs is therefore $7 \times 24 = 168$ [@problem_id:746808].

### Connections to Fourier Analysis

The theory of characters for [finite groups](@entry_id:139710) can be viewed as a far-reaching generalization of classical Fourier analysis. This perspective is clearest when considering [finite abelian groups](@entry_id:136632).

#### Fourier Analysis on Finite Abelian Groups

For a finite abelian group $G$, every element is in its own [conjugacy class](@entry_id:138270) of size 1. Consequently, $|C_G(g)| = |G|$ for all $g \in G$. The [second orthogonality relation](@entry_id:137603) simplifies to:
$$ \sum_{\chi \in \operatorname{Irr}(G)} \chi(g) \overline{\chi(h)} = |G| \delta_{g,h} $$
This is the discrete version of the orthogonality of the [complex exponential](@entry_id:265100) functions that form the basis of Fourier series. The set of irreducible characters, $\operatorname{Irr}(G)$ (also called the [dual group](@entry_id:141479) $\hat{G}$), forms an orthonormal basis for the space of complex-valued functions on $G$.

A fundamental result that follows directly from this relation is obtained by setting $h=e$ (the [identity element](@entry_id:139321)). Since $\overline{\chi(e)} = \chi(e^{-1}) = \chi(e)=1$ for any character, the relation becomes:
$$ \sum_{\chi \in \operatorname{Irr}(G)} \chi(g) = 0 \quad \text{for any } g \neq e $$
This states that the sum of the values of all [irreducible characters](@entry_id:145398) at any non-[identity element](@entry_id:139321) is zero. This can be verified directly for simple groups like $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$. Summing the values of its four characters at the element $(1,0)$ gives $1 + (-1) + 1 + (-1) = 0$ [@problem_id:1619328]. This result is a cornerstone of Fourier analysis on [finite abelian groups](@entry_id:136632) and finds applications in fields ranging from number theory to signal processing. From this viewpoint, the [character theory](@entry_id:144021) of [non-abelian groups](@entry_id:145211) is often described as "non-commutative Fourier analysis."
