## Introduction
In the [representation theory of finite groups](@entry_id:143275), [character theory](@entry_id:144021) stands as a cornerstone, translating complex [algebraic structures](@entry_id:139459) into the more tractable language of linear algebra. The [character table](@entry_id:145187) of a group, a matrix of complex numbers, encodes a surprising amount of information. While the [first orthogonality relation](@entry_id:143781) governs the rows of this table, a second, equally powerful relation governs its columns, providing a direct and actionable link between character values and the concrete structure of the group. This article delves into this [second orthogonality relation](@entry_id:137603), illuminating how it bridges the abstract world of characters with tangible group properties like conjugacy classes and centralizers. The first chapter, "Principles and Mechanisms," will formally introduce the theorem and its immediate consequences for calculating centralizer sizes and testing for conjugacy. Following this, "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections" will demonstrate the relation's utility in a broader context, from analyzing direct products and group algebras to its parallels in [modular representation theory](@entry_id:147491). Finally, "Hands-On Practices" will offer concrete exercises to apply these principles and solidify your understanding of this indispensable tool in group theory.

## Principles and Mechanisms

In the study of [group representations](@entry_id:145425), the [character table](@entry_id:145187) of a finite group serves as a powerful repository of its structural information. While the [first orthogonality relation](@entry_id:143781) illuminates the properties of the rows of this table—corresponding to the irreducible characters themselves—an equally profound relationship governs the columns. This [second orthogonality relation](@entry_id:137603), often termed the column orthogonality relation, provides a direct linkage between the character values associated with group elements and fundamental group-theoretic quantities such as the sizes of centralizers and conjugacy classes.

### The Second Orthogonality Relation

Let $G$ be a [finite group](@entry_id:151756) and let $\{\chi_1, \chi_2, \dots, \chi_k\}$ be the complete set of its irreducible complex characters. The character table of $G$ can be viewed as a square matrix where the rows are indexed by the characters and the columns are indexed by the [conjugacy classes](@entry_id:143916) of the group. The [first orthogonality relation](@entry_id:143781) establishes that the rows of this matrix, when properly weighted, are orthonormal. The [second orthogonality relation](@entry_id:137603) reveals a similar property for the columns.

Formally, for any two elements $g, h \in G$, the **[second orthogonality relation](@entry_id:137603)** is given by:
$$ \sum_{i=1}^{k} \chi_i(g) \overline{\chi_i(h)} = \begin{cases} |C_G(g)|  \text{if } g \text{ is conjugate to } h \\ 0  \text{if } g \text{ is not conjugate to } h \end{cases} $$
Here, $\overline{\chi_i(h)}$ denotes the complex conjugate of the character value $\chi_i(h)$, and $C_G(g)$ is the **centralizer** of $g$ in $G$, which is the subgroup of all elements that commute with $g$. Since characters are class functions, the value of $\chi_i(g)$ is the same for all elements in the [conjugacy class](@entry_id:138270) of $g$. Consequently, if $g$ and $h$ are conjugate, we can replace $h$ with $g$ in the formula. This leads to the most frequently used form of the relation.

### Applications of the Diagonal Case: Centralizers and Class Sizes

The most immediate application of the [second orthogonality relation](@entry_id:137603) arises from the "diagonal" case, where we compare a conjugacy class with itself (i.e., we set $h=g$). In this scenario, the relation simplifies significantly:
$$ \sum_{i=1}^{k} \chi_i(g) \overline{\chi_i(g)} = \sum_{i=1}^{k} |\chi_i(g)|^2 = |C_G(g)| $$
This remarkable formula states that the sum of the squared magnitudes of all [irreducible character](@entry_id:145297) values for an element $g$ is precisely the order of the [centralizer](@entry_id:146604) of $g$. This provides a method for computing centralizer sizes directly from the character table, without needing to inspect the group's [multiplication table](@entry_id:138189).

For instance, consider the [dihedral group](@entry_id:143875) $D_4$ of order 8. Its character table lists the values of the five irreducible characters for each of its five [conjugacy classes](@entry_id:143916). Let us calculate the order of the [centralizer of an element](@entry_id:143269) $r$, a rotation by $90^\circ$. The column of character values corresponding to $r$ is $(1, 1, -1, -1, 0)$. Applying the formula, we find:
$$ |C_{D_4}(r)| = \sum_{i=1}^{5} |\chi_i(r)|^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 + (-1)^2 + (-1)^2 + 0^2 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 4 $$
Thus, the centralizer of the element $r$ in $D_4$ has order 4. This calculation, performed entirely using character values, reveals a key structural property of the group. [@problem_id:1811801] [@problem_id:1636288]

This connection can be extended to determine the size of the [conjugacy class](@entry_id:138270) itself. The Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem, when applied to the action of a group on itself by conjugation, yields the fundamental identity: $|G| = |\text{Cl}(g)| \cdot |C_G(g)|$, where $|\text{Cl}(g)|$ is the size of the [conjugacy class](@entry_id:138270) of $g$. By rearranging this and substituting our formula for $|C_G(g)|$, we arrive at an expression for the class size:
$$ |\text{Cl}(g)| = \frac{|G|}{|C_G(g)|} = \frac{|G|}{\sum_{i=1}^{k} |\chi_i(g)|^2} $$
This provides a powerful tool for deducing the entire class structure of a group from its character table. For example, if a group $G$ has order $|G|=24$ and for some element $g \in G$ we find that $\sum_{i=1}^{k} |\chi_i(g)|^2 = 4$, we can immediately determine the size of its [conjugacy class](@entry_id:138270):
$$ |\text{Cl}(g)| = \frac{24}{4} = 6 $$
The element $g$ must therefore belong to a conjugacy class containing 6 elements. [@problem_id:1654184] This principle is universally applicable. In the symmetric group $S_4$ (order 24), the character values for a 3-cycle are $(1, 1, 0, 0, -1)$. The [sum of squares](@entry_id:161049) is $1^2+1^2+0^2+0^2+(-1)^2=3$. This tells us $|C_{S_4}((123))|=3$. The size of the [conjugacy class](@entry_id:138270) of 3-cycles is therefore $|S_4|/3 = 24/3 = 8$, which is a well-known fact. [@problem_id:1654195] [@problem_id:1654226]

### Applications of the Off-Diagonal Case: Testing for Conjugacy

The "off-diagonal" case of the [second orthogonality relation](@entry_id:137603), where $g$ and $h$ are not conjugate, provides a potent criterion for distinguishing between conjugacy classes. The relation states:
$$ \sum_{i=1}^{k} \chi_i(g) \overline{\chi_i(h)} = 0 \quad (\text{if } g \text{ is not conjugate to } h) $$
This implies that the column vectors of the character table, corresponding to distinct [conjugacy classes](@entry_id:143916), are orthogonal with respect to the standard Hermitian inner product. This condition serves as a stringent consistency check. If one were to propose a [character table](@entry_id:145187) for a group, a simple way to test its validity is to check the orthogonality of its columns.

Suppose a researcher claims that for a group of order 20, two elements $g$ and $h$ from different conjugacy classes have character vectors $v_g = (1, 1, 1, -1, -1)$ and $v_h = (1, -1, 1, i, -i)$. We can test this claim by computing the inner product of these two vectors:
$$ \sum_{i=1}^{5} \chi_i(g) \overline{\chi_i(h)} = (1)(\overline{1}) + (1)(\overline{-1}) + (1)(\overline{1}) + (-1)(\overline{i}) + (-1)(\overline{-i}) $$
$$ = (1)(1) + (1)(-1) + (1)(1) + (-1)(-i) + (-1)(i) = 1 - 1 + 1 + i - i = 1 $$
Since the result is 1 and not 0, the [orthogonality condition](@entry_id:168905) is violated. Therefore, the claim that these two vectors represent distinct conjugacy classes must be false. The elements $g$ and $h$ must be conjugate. [@problem_id:1654193] This same principle applies to any pair of non-conjugate elements. For example, if an element $g$ is not conjugate to its square, $g^2$, then the character values must satisfy $\sum_{i=1}^{k} \chi_i(g) \overline{\chi_i(g^2)} = 0$. [@problem_id:1654190]

### Deeper Structural Insights

The [second orthogonality relation](@entry_id:137603) is more than a computational tool; it reveals profound connections between a group's [character theory](@entry_id:144021) and its algebraic structure.

A particularly elegant application arises when considering elements that are not conjugate to their inverses. A key property of characters is that for any element $g \in G$, we have $\overline{\chi(g)} = \chi(g^{-1})$. This is because the eigenvalues of any representing matrix $\rho(g)$ are [roots of unity](@entry_id:142597), and the eigenvalues of $\rho(g^{-1}) = \rho(g)^{-1}$ are their inverses. Since for a root of unity $\lambda$, its inverse is its [complex conjugate](@entry_id:174888) ($\lambda^{-1} = \overline{\lambda}$), the trace of $\rho(g^{-1})$ is the complex conjugate of the trace of $\rho(g)$.

Now, consider an element $g$ that is not conjugate to its inverse, $g^{-1}$. By the off-diagonal orthogonality relation (with $h = g^{-1}$):
$$ \sum_{i=1}^{k} \chi_i(g) \overline{\chi_i(g^{-1})} = 0 $$
Using the property $\overline{\chi_i(g^{-1})} = \chi_i((g^{-1})^{-1}) = \chi_i(g)$, we can substitute this into the sum:
$$ \sum_{i=1}^{k} \chi_i(g) \chi_i(g) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} (\chi_i(g))^2 = 0 $$
This result has a striking consequence. If all the character values $\chi_i(g)$ were real numbers, this sum would be a [sum of squares](@entry_id:161049) of real numbers, which can only be zero if every term is zero. However, the trivial character $\chi_1$ always has $\chi_1(g)=1$. Therefore, for the sum to be zero, at least one of the character values $\chi_i(g)$ must be a non-real complex number. In other words, if a group possesses an element that is not conjugate to its inverse, the group *must* have at least one [irreducible character](@entry_id:145297) that is not real-valued. This connects a global structural property (conjugacy classes) to the arithmetic nature of the characters. [@problem_id:1811819]

The relation can also illuminate the [structure of abelian groups](@entry_id:140745). Recall the fundamental result $|G| = \sum_{i=1}^k (\dim \chi_i)^2$. Suppose we are given that a group has $k$ irreducible characters and that $\sum_{i=1}^k (\dim \chi_i)^2 = k$. This immediately implies $|G|=k$. Since the number of irreducible characters $k$ is always equal to the number of [conjugacy classes](@entry_id:143916), we have a group of order $k$ with exactly $k$ conjugacy classes. This is only possible if every conjugacy class has size 1, which is the defining property of an [abelian group](@entry_id:139381). For any element $g$ in an [abelian group](@entry_id:139381), its centralizer is the entire group, so $|C_G(g)| = |G| = k$. Applying the [second orthogonality relation](@entry_id:137603), we find:
$$ \sum_{i=1}^k |\chi_i(g)|^2 = |C_G(g)| = k $$
This demonstrates how character-theoretic data can force a group to be abelian and determines the value of this specific sum for every element in the group. [@problem_id:1654182]

Finally, the orthogonality relation can be used to dissect the [character theory](@entry_id:144021) of a group relative to its [normal subgroups](@entry_id:147397). Let $N$ be a [normal subgroup](@entry_id:144438) of $G$. The set of [irreducible characters](@entry_id:145398) of $G$, $\text{Irr}(G)$, can be partitioned into two sets: those for which $N$ is contained in the kernel of the character ($N \subseteq \ker(\chi)$), and those for which it is not. A character satisfies $N \subseteq \ker(\chi)$ if and only if it is an "inflation" of an [irreducible character](@entry_id:145297) of the [quotient group](@entry_id:142790) $G/N$. The sum over all characters is known: $\sum_{\chi \in \text{Irr}(G)} |\chi(g)|^2 = |C_G(g)|$. The sum over the subset corresponding to the [quotient group](@entry_id:142790) is simply the [second orthogonality relation](@entry_id:137603) applied within $G/N$:
$$ \sum_{\chi \in \text{Irr}(G), N \subseteq \ker(\chi)} |\chi(g)|^2 = \sum_{\psi \in \text{Irr}(G/N)} |\psi(gN)|^2 = |C_{G/N}(gN)| $$
By subtracting this from the total sum, we obtain a beautiful group-theoretic interpretation for the sum over the remaining characters:
$$ \sum_{\chi \in \text{Irr}(G), N \not\subseteq \ker(\chi)} |\chi(g)|^2 = |C_G(g)| - |C_{G/N}(gN)| $$
This expression reveals that the sum of $|\chi(g)|^2$ over characters that do not "vanish" on the normal subgroup $N$ measures the difference in the size of the centralizer of $g$ in the full group $G$ versus the size of the centralizer of its image, $gN$, in the quotient group $G/N$. [@problem_id:1654181] This illustrates the profound depth of the [second orthogonality relation](@entry_id:137603), which not only facilitates computation but also encodes and reveals the intricate internal [structure of finite groups](@entry_id:137958).
