Symbolically, this is $G/\\ker(\\phi) \\cong \\text{im}(\\phi)$.\n\nIn this problem, the domain group is $G = \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$ and the codomain group is $H = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the kernel of the homomorphism $\\phi$, denoted $\\ker(\\phi)$. The kernel is the set of all elements in the domain $G$ that map to the identity element in the codomain $H$.

The problem statement explicitly says that the homomorphism $\\phi$ is surjective. For a surjective map, the image is equal to the entire codomain.\nTherefore, $\\text{im}(\\phi) = \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nNow, we apply the First Isomorphism Theorem, $G/\\ker(\\phi) \\cong \\text{im}(\\phi)$, by substituting the groups and subgroups we have found:\n$$ (\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}) / \\langle (2, 1) \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z} $$\n\nFinally, we compare this result with the given multiple-choice options.\n\nA. $(\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}) / \\langle (1, 2) \\rangle \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.
