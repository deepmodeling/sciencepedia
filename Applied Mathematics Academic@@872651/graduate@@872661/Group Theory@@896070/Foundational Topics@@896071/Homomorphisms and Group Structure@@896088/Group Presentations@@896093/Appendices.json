The two defining relations for the group are:\n(1) $a^{-1}ba = b^2$\n(2) $b^{-1}ab = a^2$\n\nWe begin by manipulating these relations to express one generator in terms of the other. From relation (1), by left-multiplying by $a$, we get:\n$a(a^{-1}ba) = a(b^2)$\n$(aa^{-1})ba = ab^2$\n$ba = ab^2$\n\nFrom relation (2), by left-multiplying by $b$, we get:\n$b(b^{-1}ab) = b(a^2)$\n$(bb^{-1})ab = ba^2$\n$ab = ba^2$\n\nNow we have a system of two equations describing the interaction of $a$ and $b$:\n(3) $ba = ab^2$\n(4) $ab = ba^2$\n\nWe can substitute the expression for $ba$ from (3) into equation (4):\n$ab = (ab^2)a^2$\n$ab = ab^2a^2$\n\nWe can now left-multiply both sides of this equation by $a^{-1}$:\n$a^{-1}(ab) = a^{-1}(ab^2a^2)$\n$b = b^2a^2$\n\nNext, we can left-multiply by $b^{-1}$:\n$b^{-1}b = b^{-1}(b^2a^2)$\n$e = ba^2$\n\nThis important result, $ba^2=e$, implies that $b$ is the inverse of $a^2$.\n$b = (a^2)^{-1} = a^{-2}$\n\nNow that we have expressed $b$ solely in terms of $a$, we can substitute this back into one of the original relations. Let's use relation (1), $a^{-1}ba = b^2$:\n$a^{-1}(a^{-2})a = (a^{-2})^2$\n\nLet's simplify both sides. The left side is:\n$a^{-1}a^{-2}a = a^{-3}a = a^{-2}$\nThe right side is:\n$(a^{-2})^2 = a^{-4}$\n\nEquating the simplified sides, we get:\n$a^{-2} = a^{-4}$\n\nTo solve for $a$, we can right-multiply by $a^4$:\n$a^{-2}a^4 = a^{-4}a^4$\n$a^2 = e$\n\nThis tells us that the element $a$ has order 1 or 2. We can now use this result to determine $b$. We found that $b = a^{-2}$. Since $a^2=e$, its inverse is also the identity, so $a^{-2} = (a^2)^{-1} = e^{-1} = e$.\nTherefore, $b=e$.\n\nFinally, we substitute $b=e$ back into one of the original relations to find the definitive value of $a$. Using relation (2), $b^{-1}ab=a^2$:\nSince $b=e$, its inverse is also $b^{-1}=e$. Substituting these in gives:\n$e^{-1}ae = a^2$\n$a = a^2$\n\nLeft-multiplying by $a^{-1}$ gives:\n$a^{-1}a = a^{-1}a^2$\n$e = a$\n\nWe have shown that both generators of the group, $a$ and $b$, must be the identity element $e$. Any element of the group $G$ is a \"word\" formed by products of $a, b,$ and their inverses. Since $a=e, b=e, a^{-1}=e,$ and $b^{-1}=e$, any such word must simplify to the identity element $e$.
