The group operation $\\cdot$ is performed component-wise: for any $(g_1, g_2)$ and $(h_1, h_2)$ in $G_1 \\times G_2$, their product is given by $(g_1, g_2) \\cdot (h_1, h_2) = (g_1 *_1 h_1, g_2 *_2 h_2)$.\n\nThe group of integers modulo $n$, denoted $\\mathbb{Z}_n$, consists of the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$ with the operation of addition modulo $n$. The order of an element $g$ in a group $G$, denoted $|g|$, is the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $g^k = e$, where $e$ is the identity element of $G$.
