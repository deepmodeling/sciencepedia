We need to count the number of matrices that satisfy the given conditions.\n\n1.  **Identify the form of matrices in H.**\n    The problem states that $H$ is a subgroup of $GL_2(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ consisting of upper-triangular matrices with equal diagonal entries. A general $2 \\times 2$ upper-triangular matrix with entries in the field $\\mathbb{F}_p$ has the form:\n    $$ M = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & d \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    where $a, b, d \\in \\mathbb{F}_p$.

A matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is non-zero. The determinant of $M$ is:\n    $$ \\det(M) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ 0 & a \\end{pmatrix} = (a)(a) - (b)(0) = a^2 $$\n    The condition for invertibility is $\\det(M) \\neq 0$. In the field $\\mathbb{F}_p$, this means:\n    $$ a^2 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{p} $$\n    Since $p$ is a prime number, $\\mathbb{F}_p$ is a field. In a field, a product $xy=0$ if and only if $x=0$ or $y=0$. Therefore, the condition $a^2 \\neq 0$ is equivalent to $a \\neq 0$.\n\n3.  **Count the number of possible elements.**\n    The matrices in $H$ are uniquely determined by the choice of the entries $a$ and $b$, subject to the constraints we have found:\n    -   $a, b \\in \\mathbb{F}_p$.\n    -   $a \\neq 0$.\n    -   There is no constraint on $b$.\n\n    The field $\\mathbb{F}_p$ has $p$ elements, represented by $\\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, p-1\\}$.\n    -   The number of choices for the entry $a$: It can be any element of $\\mathbb{F}_p$ except for $0$.

In other words, $Av$ must be a scalar multiple of $v$. So, for every $v \\neq 0$, there exists a scalar $\\lambda_v \\in \\mathbb{F}_p$ such that:\n    $$ Av = \\lambda_v v $$\n    Since $A$ is invertible and $v \\neq 0$, we must have $Av \\neq 0$, which implies $\\lambda_v \\neq 0$.\n\n2.  **Show the scalar is constant.**\n    We need to show that the scalar $\\lambda_v$ is the same for all vectors $v$. Let $v_1$ and $v_2$ be two linearly independent vectors in $V = \\mathbb{F}_p^2$.

Now consider the vector $v_3 = v_1 + v_2$. Since $v_1$ and $v_2$ are linearly independent, $v_3$ is also a non-zero vector. Therefore, $A$ must also stabilize the span of $v_3$:\n    $$ A(v_1 + v_2) = \\lambda_3 (v_1 + v_2) $$\n    for some non-zero scalar $\\lambda_3$. By linearity of the matrix-vector product, we also have:\n    $$ A(v_1 + v_2) = Av_1 + Av_2 = \\lambda_1 v_1 + \\lambda_2 v_2 $$\n    Equating the two expressions for $A(v_1 + v_2)$:\n    $$ \\lambda_1 v_1 + \\lambda_2 v_2 = \\lambda_3 (v_1 + v_2) = \\lambda_3 v_1 + \\lambda_3 v_2 $$\n    Rearranging the terms gives:\n    $$ (\\lambda_1 - \\lambda_3)v_1 + (\\lambda_2 - \\lambda_3)v_2 = 0 $$\n    Since $v_1$ and $v_2$ are linearly independent, their coefficients must be zero:\n    $$ \\lambda_1 - \\lambda_3 = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\lambda_2 - \\lambda_3 = 0 $$\n    This implies $\\lambda_1 = \\lambda_3$ and $\\lambda_2 = \\lambda_3$, so $\\lambda_1 = \\lambda_2$.\n\n3.  **Characterize the matrices in H.**\n    Since the scalar is the same for any two linearly independent vectors, and any non-zero vector can be part of a basis, the scalar $\\lambda_v$ must be a constant value $\\lambda$ for all non-zero vectors $v \\in V$. This means that for any $v \\in V$, $Av = \\lambda v$. This is the definition of a scalar matrix. Thus, $A$ must be of the form:\n    $$ A = \\lambda I = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} $$\n    where $I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix.\n\n4.  **Count the number of possible matrices.**\n    The matrix $A$ must be in $GL_2(\\mathbb{F}_p)$, so it must be invertible.

The set of non-zero elements in $\\mathbb{F}_p$ is the multiplicative group $\\mathbb{F}_p^\\times$, which has $p-1$ elements.\n    \n    Therefore, the subgroup $H$ consists of all scalar matrices with non-zero scalars. The number of such matrices is $p-1$.\n    $$ H = \\{ \\lambda I \\mid \\lambda \\in \\mathbb{F}_p^\\times \\} $$\n    The order of $H$ is $|H| = |\\mathbb{F}_p^\\times| = p-1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{p-1}$$", "id": "788414"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice explores the complexities that arise when we move from fields to rings that possess zero divisors.

This induces a group homomorphism $\\pi: SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}_4) \\to SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}_2)$ where each entry of a matrix in $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}_4)$ is reduced modulo 2.\n\n2.  **Calculate the order of the target group.**\n    The target group is $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}_2)$. Since $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ is a field, any matrix with a non-zero determinant is invertible. The determinant can only be 1 (non-zero) or 0. Thus, in this case, $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}_2) = GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}_2)$. The order of $GL_2(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ is $(p^2-1)(p^2-p)$. For $p=2$:\n    $$|SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}_2)| = |GL_2(\\mathbb{Z}_2)| = (2^2-1)(2^2-2) = (3)(2) = 6.$$\n\n3.  **Apply the First Isomorphism Theorem.**\n    By the First Isomorphism Theorem for groups, we have $|SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}_4)| = |\\text{Im}(\\pi)| \\cdot |\\ker(\\pi)|$.

We can lift $A_2$ to a matrix $A_4$ with entries in $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ by choosing representatives (e.g., mapping $0 \\to 0, 1 \\to 1$). The determinant of this lifted matrix, $\\det(A_4)$, when reduced modulo 2, is $\\det(A_2) = 1$. This means $\\det(A_4)$ must be an odd number in $\\mathbb{Z}_4$, so $\\det(A_4)$ is either 1 or 3.\n    - If $\\det(A_4) = 1$, then $A_4$ is in $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}_4)$ and $\\pi(A_4) = A_2$.\n    - If $\\det(A_4) = 3$, we can modify $A_4$ to get a determinant of 1. The units in $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ are $\\{1, 3\\}$. Multiplying the first row of $A_4$ by 3 (which is a unit) gives a new matrix $A'_4$. The new determinant will be $3 \\cdot \\det(A_4) = 3 \\cdot 3 = 9 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$. This new matrix $A'_4$ is in $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}_4)$ and still reduces to $A_2$ modulo 2 (since $3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod 2$).\n    Since any matrix in $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}_2)$ has a preimage in $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}_4)$, the map $\\pi$ is surjective.\n\n5.  **Characterize and count the kernel.**\n    The kernel of $\\pi$, $\\ker(\\pi)$, consists of matrices in $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}_4)$ that reduce to the identity matrix in $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}_2)$.

This can be written as $X = I + 2Y$, where $Y = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$ is a matrix over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$.\n    The condition for $X$ to be in $SL_2(\\mathbb{Z}_4)$ is $\\det(X) = 1$.\n    $$ \\det(X) = (1+2a)(1+2d) - (2b)(2c) = 1 + 2a + 2d + 4ad - 4bc $$\n    Working in $\\mathbb{Z}_4$, this becomes:\n    $$ \\det(X) \\equiv 1 + 2(a+d) \\pmod 4 $$\n    For $\\det(X)$ to be 1, we must have $1 + 2(a+d) \\equiv 1 \\pmod 4$, which implies $2(a+d) \\equiv 0 \\pmod 4$. This is equivalent to the condition that $a+d$ is an even number, i.e., $a+d \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n    This is precisely the condition that the trace of the matrix $Y$ is zero in $\\mathbb{Z}_2$: $\\text{tr}(Y) = a+d \\equiv 0 \\pmod 2$.\n\n    We need to count how many $2 \\times 2$ matrices $Y$ over $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ have a trace of 0.\n    - The entries $b$ and $c$ can be chosen freely: 2 choices for $b$, 2 choices for $c$.\n    - For the diagonal entries $a$ and $d$, the condition is $a+d=0$.
