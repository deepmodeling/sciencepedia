This yields the cyclic group of order $3$, which indeed has exactly $3$ conjugacy classes.\n\nNow assume $G$ is nonabelian with exactly $3$ conjugacy classes. Let $z = |Z(G)|$. Each central element forms a singleton conjugacy class, hence the number of noncentral conjugacy classes is $k - z = 3 - z$.
