Using the relation $srs=r^{-1}$, which implies $sr=r^{-1}s$, we can generalize this to $sr^k = r^{-k}s$.\nSo, $(sr^k)^2 = s(r^k s)r^k = s(s r^{-k})r^k = s^2 r^{-k} r^k = e r^0 = e$.\nSince $sr^k \\neq e$, all 6 reflection elements $\\{s, sr, sr^2, sr^3, sr^4, sr^5\\}$ have order 2.\nIn summary:\n- Elements of order 2: $r^3, s, sr, sr^2, sr^3, sr^4, sr^5$ (7 elements).\n- Elements of order 3: $r^2, r^4$ (2 elements).\n\nNow we evaluate each option:\n\n**A. $(s, sr^2)$**\n- Let $a=s$ and $b=sr^2$.\n- The elements are distinct.\n- Order of $a=s$: From the relation $s^2=e$, the order is 2.\n- Order of $b=sr^2$: This is a reflection, so its order is 2 as shown above.\n- The product is $ab = s(sr^2)$.

For a permutation, the order is the least common multiple of the lengths of its disjoint cycles. Therefore, to have order $10$, the cycle structure must have lengths whose least common multiple is $10$. This forces the presence of a cycle length divisible by $5$, i.e., a $5$-cycle or a $10$-cycle, and possibly some $2$-cycles; $1$-cycles (fixed points) do not affect the order or parity.\n\nThe sign of a $k$-cycle is $(-1)^{k-1}$. Hence:\n- a $5$-cycle has sign $(-1)^{4}=+1$ (even),\n- a $10$-cycle has sign $(-1)^{9}=-1$ (odd),\n- a $2$-cycle has sign $(-1)^{1}=-1$ (odd).\n\nConsider a permutation that is a product of $a$ disjoint $5$-cycles, $b$ disjoint $10$-cycles, and $c$ disjoint $2$-cycles. Its sign is\n$$(-1)^{4a+9b+c} = (-1)^{b+c}$$\nso it lies in $A_n$ if and only if $b+c$ is even. The number of moved points is $5a+10b+2c$, so the smallest $n$ allowing such a permutation equals the minimal possible value of $5a+10b+2c$ subject to:\n- the order condition: the $\\operatorname{lcm}$ of the cycle lengths is $10$, which requires either $b \\ge 1$, or $b=0$ with $a \\ge 1$ and $c \\ge 1$;\n- the evenness condition: $b+c \\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}$.\n\nWe minimize in cases:\n\n1) If $b=0$, then we must have $a \\ge 1$ and $c \\ge 1$ to get an $\\operatorname{lcm}$ of $10$, and evenness requires $c$ to be even. The minimal choice is $a=1, c=2$, giving $5a+10b+2c=5+0+4=9$. An explicit example is $(1\\ 2\\ 3\\ 4\\ 5)(6\\ 7)(8\\ 9)$, which has order $\\operatorname{lcm}(5,2,2)=10$ and sign $(-1)^{4+1+1}=+1$.\n\n2) If $b=1$, then evenness requires $c$ to be odd; the minimal is $c=1$, giving $5a+10b+2c \\ge 10+2=12$ (taking $a=0$ minimizes further).\n\n3) If $b \\ge 2$, then the minimal is $b=2$, with $c$ even (take $c=0$), and $a=0$, giving $5a+10b+2c=20$.\n\nThus the minimal number of moved points, and hence the minimal $n$, is $9$. For all $n9$, the only feasible structures either do not reach order $10$ or are odd permutations (for instance, a $5$-cycle with a single $2$-cycle uses $7$ points but is odd), while a $10$-cycle itself requires at least $10$ points.
