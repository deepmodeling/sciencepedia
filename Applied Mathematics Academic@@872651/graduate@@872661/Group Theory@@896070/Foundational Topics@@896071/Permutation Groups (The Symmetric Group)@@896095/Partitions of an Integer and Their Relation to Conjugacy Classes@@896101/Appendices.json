By working through this problem, you will solidify your understanding of how a permutation's cycle structure is encoded by its partition, focusing on the special case of derangements [@problem_id:737056].", "problem": "In the study of finite groups, the symmetric group $S_n$ is of fundamental importance. It is the group of all permutations of a set of $n$ distinct objects. The structure of $S_n$ is deeply connected to the combinatorics of integer partitions.\n\nA key concept in group theory is that of a conjugacy class. Two elements $g_1, g_2$ of a group $G$ are conjugate if there exists an element $h \\in G$ such that $g_1 = h g_2 h^{-1}$. This defines an equivalence relation, and the equivalence classes are called conjugacy classes. For the symmetric group $S_n$, the conjugacy classes are characterized by the cycle structure of the permutations. Specifically, two permutations are in the same conjugacy class if and only if they have the same number of cycles of each length when written in their disjoint cycle decomposition.\n\nThis leads to a one-to-one correspondence between the conjugacy classes of $S_n$ and the integer partitions of $n$. A partition of an integer $n$ is a way of writing $n$ as a sum of positive integers, where the order of the summands does not matter. For example, the partitions of $4$ are $4$, $3+1$, $2+2$, $2+1+1$, and $1+1+1+1$. Each of these corresponds to a unique conjugacy class in $S_4$.\n\nA permutation $\\sigma \\in S_n$ is said to have a fixed point if there exists an element $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$ such that $\\sigma(i) = i$. In terms of cycle structure, a fixed point corresponds to a cycle of length 1. Permutations with no fixed points are also known as derangements. The conjugacy classes corresponding to derangements are those whose cycle structures do not include any 1-cycles. This, in turn, corresponds to partitions of $n$ where no part is equal to 1.\n\n**Problem:**\nDetermine the number of conjugacy classes in the symmetric group $S_{15}$ that consist of permutations with no fixed points.", "solution": "1.
