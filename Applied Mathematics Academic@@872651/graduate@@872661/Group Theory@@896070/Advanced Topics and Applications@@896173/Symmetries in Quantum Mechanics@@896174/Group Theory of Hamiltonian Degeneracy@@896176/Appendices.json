Specifically, we are interested in the singlet states ($S=0$), and we need to calculate the sum of the dimensions of their spatial irreducible representations ($\\Gamma$).\n\n**2. Pauli Principle and Symmetry**\nAccording to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, singlet states ($S=0$, antisymmetric spin part) must be paired with a symmetric spatial wavefunction. The symmetric spatial part is found by decomposing the symmetric direct product $[t_2 \\otimes t_2]_{\\text{sym}}$.\n\n**3. Character Analysis of the Direct Product**\nThe spatial representation is $t_2 \\otimes t_2$. We first need the characters for this direct product and its symmetric part. The relevant character formula is:\n$$ \\chi^{[t_2 \\otimes t_2]_{\\text{sym}}}(g) = \\frac{1}{2} [ (\\chi^{t_2}(g))^2 + \\chi^{t_2}(g^2) ] $$\n\n**4. Determine Characters $\\chi^{t_2}(g)$ and $\\chi^{t_2}(g^2)$**\nFrom the provided character table for $T_d$, the characters for the $t_2$ irrep are:\n$$ \\chi^{t_2} = (3, 0, -1, -1, 1) $$\nfor the classes $(E, 8C_3, 3C_2, 6S_4, 6\\sigma_d)$ respectively.\n\nNext, we calculate the squares of these characters:\n$$ (\\chi^{t_2}(g))^2 = (3^2, 0^2, (-1)^2, (-1)^2, 1^2) = (9, 0, 1, 1, 1) $$\n\nNow we need to find the character $\\chi^{t_2}(g^2)$ for a representative operation $g$ from each class:\n- For $g \\in E$: $g^2 = E^2 = E$. So, $\\chi^{t_2}(E^2) = \\chi^{t_2}(E) = 3$.\n- For $g \\in 8C_3$: $g^2 = (C_3)^2 = C_3^{-1}$. A $C_3^{-1}$ rotation is in the same class as $C_3$. So, $\\chi^{t_2}((C_3)^2) = \\chi^{t_2}(C_3) = 0$.\n- For $g \\in 3C_2$: $g^2 = (C_2)^2 = E$. So, $\\chi^{t_2}((C_2)^2) = \\chi^{t_2}(E) = 3$.\n- For $g \\in 6S_4$: $g^2 = (S_4)^2 = C_2$. A $C_2$ rotation is in the $3C_2$ class. So, $\\chi^{t_2}((S_4)^2) = \\chi^{t_2}(C_2) = -1$.\n- For $g \\in 6\\sigma_d$: $g^2 = (\\sigma_d)^2 = E$. So, $\\chi^{t_2}((\\sigma_d)^2) = \\chi^{t_2}(E) = 3$.\n\nThe vector of characters for $g^2$ operations is:\n$$ \\chi^{t_2}(g^2) = (3, 0, 3, -1, 3) $$\n\n**5.

Decompose the Reducible Representation**\nWe use the reduction formula to find which irreps sum to $[t_2 \\otimes t_2]_{\\text{sym}}$. The formula is $n_i = \\frac{1}{|G|} \\sum_k N_k \\chi_i^*(g_k) \\chi_{\\text{red}}(g_k)$, where $|G|$ is the order of the group, $N_k$ is the number of elements in class $k$, $\\chi_i$ is the character of irrep $i$, and $\\chi_{\\text{red}}$ is the character of the reducible representation. The order of $T_d$ is $|G| = 1 + 8 + 3 + 6 + 6 = 24$.\n\n- For $A_1$: $n_{A_1} = \\frac{1}{24} [1(1)(6) + 8(1)(0) + 3(1)(2) + 6(1)(0) + 6(1)(2)] = \\frac{1}{24}[6 + 6 + 12] = \\frac{24}{24} = 1$.\n- For $A_2$: $n_{A_2} = \\frac{1}{24} [1(1)(6) + 8(1)(0) + 3(1)(2) + 6(-1)(0) + 6(-1)(2)] = \\frac{1}{24}[6 + 6 - 12] = 0$.\n- For $E$: $n_E = \\frac{1}{24} [1(2)(6) + 8(-1)(0) + 3(2)(2) + 6(0)(0) + 6(0)(2)] = \\frac{1}{24}[12 + 12] = \\frac{24}{24} = 1$.\n- For $T_1$: $n_{T_1} = \\frac{1}{24} [1(3)(6) + 8(0)(0) + 3(-1)(2) + 6(1)(0) + 6(-1)(2)] = \\frac{1}{24}[18 - 6 - 12] = 0$.\n- For $T_2$: $n_{T_2} = \\frac{1}{24} [1(3)(6) + 8(0)(0) + 3(-1)(2) + 6(-1)(0) + 6(1)(2)] = \\frac{1}{24}[18 - 6 + 12] = \\frac{24}{24} = 1$.\n\nSo, the decomposition of the symmetric spatial part is:\n$$ [t_2 \\otimes t_2]_{\\text{sym}} = A_1 + E + T_2 $$\n\n**7. Identify Singlet States and Sum their Dimensions**\nThe singlet states ($S=0$) correspond to these symmetric spatial irreps. The term symbols for the singlet states are $^1A_1$, $^1E$, and $^1T_2$.\nThe problem asks for the sum of the dimensions of these spatial irreps. The dimension of an irrep is its character under the identity operation, $\\chi^\\Gamma(E)$.\n- $\\dim(A_1) = \\chi^{A_1}(E) = 1$\n- $\\dim(E) = \\chi^{E}(E) = 2$\n- $\\dim(T_2) = \\chi^{T_2}(E) = 3$\n\nThe sum of the dimensions is:\n$$ \\text{Sum} = \\dim(A_1) + \\dim(E) + \\dim(T_2) = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 $$\n\n(For completeness, the antisymmetric spatial part, $\\{t_2 \\otimes t_2\\}_{\\text{anti}}$, corresponds to the triplet state $S=1$. Its character is $\\chi^{\\{t_2 \\otimes t_2\\}_{\\text{anti}}} = (3, 0, -1, 1, -1)$, which matches the irrep $T_1$. So the triplet term is $^3T_1$. The total number of microstates is $1\\times\\dim(A_1) + 1\\times\\dim(E) + 1\\times\\dim(T_2) + 3\\times\\dim(T_1) = 1(1) + 1(2) + 1(3) + 3(3) = 1+2+3+9=15$.
