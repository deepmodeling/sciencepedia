{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A central application of group theory in magnetism is the classification of collective excitations, such as magnons. By treating the spin deviations on each magnetic ion as a basis, we can construct a 'magnetic representation' whose decomposition into irreducible representations (irreps) of the crystal's point group reveals the symmetry and degeneracy of the magnon modes. This first practice problem ([@problem_id:701017]) guides you through this fundamental procedure for a common antiferromagnetic structure, demonstrating how to build and reduce the representation for magnons at the Brillouin zone center.", "problem": "Consider a simplified model of an A-type tetragonal antiferromagnet. The crystal structure has a point group symmetry of $D_{4h}$. Within the chemical unit cell, there are two magnetic ions, labeled 1 and 2, which are located on the primary rotation axis (the $z$-axis). These two ions form the basis of a magnetic unit cell. In the ground state, the spins are aligned collinearly with the $z$-axis but in opposite directions: spin $\\mathbf{S}_1$ is \"up\" ($+S\\hat{z}$) and spin $\\mathbf{S}_2$ is \"down\" ($-S\\hat{z}$).\n\nWe are interested in the collective spin excitations (magnons) at the center of the magnetic Brillouin zone ($\\mathbf{k}=0$). The symmetry of these magnon modes can be classified according to the irreducible representations (irreps) of the crystal point group $D_{4h}$. The basis for the spin deviations on the two ions can be conveniently written in terms of circular components: $\\{S_1^+, S_1^-, S_2^+, S_2^-\\}$, where $S_j^\\pm = \\delta S_{jx} \\pm i\\delta S_{jy}$ represents the small transverse spin deviations for ion $j \\in \\{1,2\\}$.\n\nThe transformation of these spin deviation operators is determined by the action of the symmetry operations of the $D_{4h}$ group on both the ion positions and the spin components. Any operation $g$ in $D_{4h}$ that exchanges the positions of the two ions will map the spin deviations of ion 1 to ion 2, and vice versa. The spin itself is a pseudovector (or axial vector), so its components transform under a group operation $R \\in O(3)$ according to the rule $\\mathbf{S}' = \\det(R) R \\mathbf{S}$.\n\nYour task is to determine the number of distinct one-magnon modes at $\\mathbf{k}=0$. A mode is considered distinct if it transforms according to a different irreducible representation of the point group $D_{4h}$. To solve this, you must first find the characters of the magnetic representation, $\\Gamma_{mag}$, which is built on the 4-dimensional basis $\\{S_1^+, S_1^-, S_2^+, S_2^-\\}$, and then decompose this representation into the irreps of $D_{4h}$.\n\nThe character table for the point group $D_{4h}$ is provided below.
