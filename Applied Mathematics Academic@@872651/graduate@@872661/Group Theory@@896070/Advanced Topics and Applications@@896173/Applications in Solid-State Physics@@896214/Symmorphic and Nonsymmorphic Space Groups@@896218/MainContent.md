## Introduction
Crystalline solids, from simple salts to complex semiconductors, are defined by their periodic atomic arrangement and underlying symmetry. This symmetry is rigorously described by one of the 230 [space groups](@entry_id:143034), which provides a complete mathematical framework for understanding a crystal's structure. However, a crucial distinction exists within this framework that divides all [space groups](@entry_id:143034) into two fundamental classes: symmorphic and nonsymmorphic. This classification is not merely a mathematical exercise; it is key to unlocking the physical behavior of materials, from their [diffraction patterns](@entry_id:145356) to their quantum electronic properties. This article demystifies this core concept in crystallography and condensed matter physics. First, the chapter on **Principles and Mechanisms** will establish the group-theoretical foundation for this distinction, exploring how the presence or absence of intrinsic fractional translations—screw axes and [glide planes](@entry_id:182991)—defines a group's character. Subsequently, the **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections** chapter will bridge theory and experiment, showing how nonsymmorphic symmetries manifest as observable phenomena like [systematic extinctions](@entry_id:157861), band sticking, and the protection of topological states. Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** section will allow you to solidify your understanding by working through concrete problems that illustrate these principles in action.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The symmetry of a crystal is fully captured by its [space group](@entry_id:140010), $G$. Each element of this group is an [isometry](@entry_id:150881) of three-dimensional space that leaves the crystal structure invariant. These symmetry operations are conveniently described by the Seitz notation, $(\mathcal{R}|\mathbf{v})$, which represents a point group operation $\mathcal{R}$ (a rotation, reflection, or inversion) followed by a translation $\mathbf{v}$. The action of such an operator on a position vector $\mathbf{r}$ is defined as:

$$
(\mathcal{R}|\mathbf{v})\mathbf{r} = \mathcal{R}\mathbf{r} + \mathbf{v}
$$

The set of all pure lattice translations, $T = \{(\mathcal{I}|\mathbf{T}_n)\}$, where $\mathcal{I}$ is the identity operation and $\mathbf{T}_n$ is any vector of the Bravais lattice, forms an invariant (or normal) subgroup of the [space group](@entry_id:140010) $G$. This crucial property allows for the classification of all 230 [space groups](@entry_id:143034) into two fundamental categories: symmorphic and nonsymmorphic. This distinction is not merely a mathematical formality; it has profound consequences for the physical properties of crystals, including their [diffraction patterns](@entry_id:145356) and electronic band structures. The key lies in the nature of the translational part, $\mathbf{v}$, associated with each point operation $\mathcal{R}$. This translation can always be decomposed into a lattice vector and a non-primitive (or fractional) translation, $\boldsymbol{\tau}(\mathcal{R})$, which is intrinsic to the operation and has a magnitude smaller than any lattice vector.

### The Factor Group and its Relation to the Point Group

Because the translational subgroup $T$ is normal in $G$, we can construct the [factor group](@entry_id:152975) (or [quotient group](@entry_id:142790)), denoted $G/T$. The elements of this [factor group](@entry_id:152975) are the [cosets](@entry_id:147145) of $T$ in $G$. Each [coset](@entry_id:149651) is a set of the form $(\mathcal{R}|\mathbf{v})T$, which contains all space group operations that share the same rotational part $\mathcal{R}$. The [factor group](@entry_id:152975) $G/T$ is always isomorphic to the crystal's crystallographic point group, $P$:

$$
G/T \cong P
$$

This isomorphism means that the set of [cosets](@entry_id:147145) has the same abstract group structure and [multiplication table](@entry_id:138189) as the [point group](@entry_id:145002). To work with the [factor group](@entry_id:152975), it is convenient to select one representative element from each coset. A natural choice for these representatives is the set of operators $\{(\mathcal{R}|\boldsymbol{\tau}(\mathcal{R})) | \mathcal{R} \in P\}$, where $\boldsymbol{\tau}(\mathcal{R})$ is the non-primitive translation associated with $\mathcal{R}$ in a specific setting. For the identity operation, we always have $\boldsymbol{\tau}(\mathcal{I}) = \mathbf{0}$. The distinction between symmorphic and [nonsymmorphic groups](@entry_id:145072) can be understood by examining the properties of this set of [coset](@entry_id:149651) representatives. [@problem_id:1797790]

### Symmorphic Space Groups: A Separable Symmetry

A space group is defined as **symmorphic** if there exists a choice of origin in the unit cell such that all non-primitive translations $\boldsymbol{\tau}(\mathcal{R})$ are zero (or, equivalently, [lattice vectors](@entry_id:161583)) for all $\mathcal{R}$ in the point group $P$. In this case, for every [point group](@entry_id:145002) operation $\mathcal{R} \in P$, the operation $(\mathcal{R}|\mathbf{0})$ is a valid symmetry operation of the crystal.

For a symmorphic group, the set of coset representatives can be chosen as $\{(\mathcal{R}|\mathbf{0}) | \mathcal{R} \in P\}$. This set of representatives itself forms a group under the space group multiplication law, and this group is isomorphic to the [point group](@entry_id:145002) $P$. For instance, for any two representatives, their product is another representative:
$$
(\mathcal{R}_1|\mathbf{0})(\mathcal{R}_2|\mathbf{0}) = (\mathcal{R}_1\mathcal{R}_2|\mathcal{R}_1\mathbf{0} + \mathbf{0}) = (\mathcal{R}_1\mathcal{R}_2|\mathbf{0})
$$
The resulting operator, $(\mathcal{R}_1\mathcal{R}_2|\mathbf{0})$, is the representative corresponding to the point operation $\mathcal{R}_1\mathcal{R}_2$. [@problem_id:285281]

#### The Role of Origin Choice

The definition of symmorphism hinges on the existence of *at least one* special origin. A given description of a space group might include non-primitive translations, but the group is still symmorphic if these can be eliminated by a suitable shift of the origin. If we shift the origin of our coordinate system by a vector $\mathbf{d}$, a space group operation $(\mathcal{R}|\mathbf{v})$ is transformed into a new operation $(\mathcal{R}|\mathbf{v}')$ where the translational part becomes:

$$
\mathbf{v}' = \mathbf{v} + (\mathcal{R}-\mathcal{I})\mathbf{d}
$$

A group is symmorphic if we can find a single vector $\mathbf{d}$ that makes $\mathbf{v}'$ a lattice vector for all operations in the group.

Consider, for example, the [space group](@entry_id:140010) $Cmmm$ (No. 65), whose point group is $mmm$ ($D_{2h}$). In a standard setting, the generating operations may be given with fractional translations, such as $\{m_y | \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{b}\}$ and $\{m_z | \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{c}\}$. This initially suggests a nonsymmorphic character. However, by seeking an origin shift $\mathbf{d} = d_x\mathbf{a} + d_y\mathbf{b} + d_z\mathbf{c}$, we can systematically eliminate these fractional parts. For the operation $\{m_y | \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{b}\}$, the new translation is $\mathbf{v}'_y = \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{b} + (m_y-\mathcal{I})\mathbf{d} = \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{b} - 2d_y\mathbf{b} = (\frac{1}{2} - 2d_y)\mathbf{b}$. For this to be a lattice vector, its component in the $\mathbf{b}$ direction must be an integer, which requires $2d_y = n + \frac{1}{2}$ for some integer $n$. Similarly, for $\{m_z | \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{c}\}$, we require $2d_z = m + \frac{1}{2}$. By choosing an origin shift such as $\mathbf{d} = \frac{1}{4}\mathbf{b} + \frac{1}{4}\mathbf{c}$, all non-primitive translations for the generating operations become [lattice vectors](@entry_id:161583), proving that $Cmmm$ is indeed symmorphic. [@problem_id:791432]

#### The Wyckoff Position Criterion

An alternative and physically intuitive definition of a [symmorphic space group](@entry_id:181229) is based on the concept of high-symmetry points in the crystal. A space group is symmorphic if and only if there exists at least one Wyckoff position in the unit cell for which the site symmetry group is isomorphic to the crystal's full point group. A site symmetry group is the subgroup of space group operations that leave a specific point fixed (up to a lattice translation).

To find such a high-symmetry point $\mathbf{r}_s$, we must find a position that is simultaneously a fixed point for every operation $\mathcal{R}$ in the point group, modulo a lattice translation $\mathbf{T}_{\mathcal{R}}$:

$$
\mathcal{R}\mathbf{r}_s + \boldsymbol{\tau}(\mathcal{R}) = \mathbf{r}_s + \mathbf{T}_{\mathcal{R}}
$$

For a symmorphic group with the origin chosen at this special Wyckoff position, all $\boldsymbol{\tau}(\mathcal{R})$ are zero, and the condition simplifies to $\mathcal{R}\mathbf{r}_s = \mathbf{r}_s + \mathbf{T}_{\mathcal{R}}$. For example, in the [symmorphic space group](@entry_id:181229) $C222$ (No. 21), we can search for points $\mathbf{r}_s=(x_s, y_s, z_s)$ that are invariant under the rotations $C_{2x}$, $C_{2y}$, and $C_{2z}$. The condition for $C_{2x}$ invariance, $C_{2x}\mathbf{r}_s - \mathbf{r}_s = (0, -2y_s, -2z_s)$, must equal a C-centered lattice vector. This constrains $y_s$ and $z_s$ to be $0$ or $1/2$. Applying this logic to all three rotations reveals a set of special points, including $(0,0,0)$ and $(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}, 0)$, which possess the full $222$ ($D_2$) [site symmetry](@entry_id:183677). The existence of these points provides a definitive proof that $C222$ is symmorphic. [@problem_id:791502]

### Nonsymmorphic Space Groups: An Intrinsic Entanglement

A [space group](@entry_id:140010) is **nonsymmorphic** if no such special origin exists. In these groups, certain point operations are inextricably linked to a non-primitive translation. The symmetry operations that embody this property are **screw axes** (rotation followed by a fractional translation parallel to the axis) and **[glide planes](@entry_id:182991)** (reflection followed by a fractional translation parallel to the plane).

For a nonsymmorphic group, the set of [coset](@entry_id:149651) representatives $\{(\mathcal{R}|\boldsymbol{\tau}(\mathcal{R}))\}$ does not form a group. The [closure property](@entry_id:136899) is violated in a specific way: the product of two representatives yields an operator that belongs to the correct [coset](@entry_id:149651), but it is not the chosen representative of that coset. Instead, it differs by a lattice translation. A classic example is the square of a screw-axis operator. For the nonsymmorphic group $G_{\text{nsym}}$ generated by a $2_1$ [screw axis](@entry_id:268289) $\{C_{2y}|\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{b}\}$, its square is: [@problem_id:285281]

$$
\{C_{2y}|\tfrac{1}{2}\mathbf{b}\}^2 = \{C_{2y}^2|C_{2y}(\tfrac{1}{2}\mathbf{b}) + \tfrac{1}{2}\mathbf{b}\} = \{\mathcal{I}|\tfrac{1}{2}\mathbf{b} + \tfrac{1}{2}\mathbf{b}\} = \{\mathcal{I}|\mathbf{b}\}
$$

The result is not the [identity operator](@entry_id:204623) $\{\mathcal{I}|\mathbf{0}\}$, but a pure lattice translation. This illustrates the intrinsic coupling: performing the screw rotation twice does not return you to the starting point, but to an equivalent point in the next unit cell. Similarly, composing two different glide operations, such as a $c$-glide and a $b$-glide in space group $Pbca$ (No. 61), results in a two-fold rotation coupled with a translation. Squaring this composite operation yields a pure lattice translation. [@problem_id:791540]

#### Proof of Nonsymmorphism

Proving a group is nonsymmorphic amounts to proving that no origin shift $\mathbf{d}$ can simultaneously remove all non-primitive translations. This can be demonstrated in several ways.

1.  **Invariant Fractional Translation:** In some cases, a component of a non-primitive translation is invariant under any origin shift. For the [space group](@entry_id:140010) $P2_1/c$ (No. 14), a key operation is a $2_1$ [screw axis](@entry_id:268289) parallel to $\mathbf{b}$, given by $\{C_{2y} | \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{c})\}$. The change in the translation vector under an origin shift $\mathbf{d}$ is $(C_{2y}-\mathcal{I})\mathbf{d}$. Since $C_{2y}$ leaves the $\mathbf{b}$ vector unchanged, the component of $(C_{2y}-\mathcal{I})\mathbf{d}$ along the $\mathbf{b}$ direction is always zero. Therefore, the new translational part, $\mathbf{v}'_{C_2}$, will always have a component of $\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{b}$. Since this fractional component can never be eliminated, no origin can make this operation a pure rotation, and the group is definitively nonsymmorphic. [@problem_id:791508]

2.  **Conflicting Requirements:** More generally, the origin shift required to eliminate the fractional translation for one operation, $\mathcal{R}_1$, may be incompatible with the shift required for another, $\mathcal{R}_2$. For instance, in the space group $P2_12_12_1$ (No. 19), the screw axes are oriented along three perpendicular directions. An attempt to find a single origin shift $\mathbf{d}$ that eliminates the fractional translations for all three screw operations leads to a system of contradictory equations. No single $\mathbf{d}$ can satisfy all conditions simultaneously, proving the group is nonsymmorphic. [@problem_id:213788]

3.  **Absence of High-Symmetry Points:** The contrapositive of the Wyckoff position criterion for symmorphic groups provides a powerful proof method. A group is nonsymmorphic if no Wyckoff position has a site [symmetry group](@entry_id:138562) isomorphic to the [crystal point group](@entry_id:183880). This can be tested by analyzing the fixed-point condition for an operation $(\mathcal{R}|\mathbf{v})$:
    $$
    (\mathcal{R}-\mathcal{I})\mathbf{x} = -(\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{T})
    $$
    This is a linear equation for the position $\mathbf{x}$. A solution exists only if the vector on the right-hand side lies in the image of the operator $(\mathcal{R}-\mathcal{I})$. For some nonsymmorphic operations, the vector $-(\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{T})$ will have a non-zero projection onto the kernel (null space) of $(\mathcal{R}-\mathcal{I})$, regardless of the choice of lattice vector $\mathbf{T}$. This signifies a fundamental inconsistency, meaning no point $\mathbf{x}$ can be a fixed point of the operation. For $P2_12_12_1$, it can be shown that this condition fails for all three screw axes, proving that no point in the crystal can have the full $222$ [site symmetry](@entry_id:183677). [@problem_id:791435]

Despite the complex nature of their coset representatives, it is crucial to remember that the [factor group](@entry_id:152975) $G/T$ of a nonsymmorphic group is still isomorphic to the point group $P$. The group multiplication holds for the [cosets](@entry_id:147145) themselves. For example, in $P2_12_12$ (No. 18), the square of the [coset](@entry_id:149651) representative $g_y = \{C_{2y} | \frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{a}_2+\mathbf{a}_3)\}$ is $\{C_{2y}|\mathbf{v}_y\}^2 = \{\mathcal{I}|\mathbf{a}_2\}$. While this is not the identity operator, it is a lattice translation and thus belongs to the identity coset $T$. Therefore, in the [factor group](@entry_id:152975), the element corresponding to $g_y$ squares to the identity, preserving the group structure of $D_2$. [@problem_id:791544]

### Physical Consequences of Nonsymmorphic Symmetries

The presence of screw axes and [glide planes](@entry_id:182991) has direct, observable physical consequences. These operations manifest as unique fingerprints in experimental data and impose strict constraints on the quantum mechanical behavior of electrons and phonons in the crystal.

One of the most direct applications is in understanding the transformation of physical fields, such as atomic orbitals, under [symmetry operations](@entry_id:143398). The action of a space group operator $S = \{g|\mathbf{v}\}$ on a scalar function $\phi(\mathbf{r})$ is given by $P_S\phi(\mathbf{r}) = \phi(S^{-1}\mathbf{r}) = \phi(g^{-1}(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{v}))$. Consider a $p_x$ orbital on an atom in the [space group](@entry_id:140010) $P4_2/mnm$ (No. 136), which contains a $2_1$ [screw axis](@entry_id:268289) $\{C_{2z} | (0,0,c/2)\}$. Applying this operation to the $p_x$ wavefunction, which is proportional to the coordinate $x$, results in a new function. The coordinate transformation is $\mathbf{r} \to S^{-1}\mathbf{r} = C_{2z}^{-1}(\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{t}) = (-x, -y, z-c/2)$. The transformed wavefunction is therefore proportional to $-x$, and its center is shifted along the $z$-axis. The screw operation both inverts the phase of the orbital and displaces it. [@problem_id:791518]

Perhaps the most significant consequence of [nonsymmorphic symmetry](@entry_id:182209) appears in the [electronic band structure](@entry_id:136694). According to Bloch's theorem, an electronic wavefunction in a periodic potential has the form $\psi_{\mathbf{k}}(\mathbf{r}) = u_{\mathbf{k}}(\mathbf{r}) \exp(i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r})$. When acted upon by a pure lattice translation $(\mathcal{I}|\mathbf{T}_n)$, the wavefunction acquires a phase factor $\exp(i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{T}_n)$. Now consider the action of the square of a screw operator, such as $S^2 = \{\mathcal{I}|\mathbf{b}\}$ from our earlier example. If a Bloch state $|\psi_{\mathbf{k}}\rangle$ were an [eigenstate](@entry_id:202009) of the screw operator $S$, then $S^2|\psi_{\mathbf{k}}\rangle$ would yield the eigenvalue squared. However, we also know that $S^2$ is a translation by $\mathbf{b}$, so it must multiply the state by $\exp(-i\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{b})$. This leads to a powerful constraint. At specific high-symmetry points on the boundary of the Brillouin zone, such as $\mathbf{k}=(0, \pi/b, 0)$, the phase factor becomes $\exp(-i\pi) = -1$. [@problem_id:285281] If a state were a non-degenerate [eigenstate](@entry_id:202009) of $S$ with eigenvalue $\lambda$, we would have the contradiction $\lambda^2 = -1$. The only way to resolve this is for the [energy eigenstates](@entry_id:152154) at this $\mathbf{k}$-point to be degenerate. This forced degeneracy, known as "band sticking", is a direct and measurable signature of [nonsymmorphic symmetry](@entry_id:182209), fundamentally altering the electronic and [topological properties](@entry_id:154666) of a material.
