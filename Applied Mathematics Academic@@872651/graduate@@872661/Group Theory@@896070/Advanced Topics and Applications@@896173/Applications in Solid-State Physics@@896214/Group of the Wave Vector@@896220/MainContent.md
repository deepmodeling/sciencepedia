## Introduction
In the quantum mechanical description of crystalline solids, symmetry is a paramount organizing principle. While the crystal's overall symmetry is described by its [space group](@entry_id:140010), this group is often too large to effectively analyze the properties of an electronic state associated with a single, specific wave vector $\vec{k}$. This creates a knowledge gap: how do we apply symmetry arguments to understand the characteristics of states at a particular point in the Brillouin zone? The answer lies in the powerful concept of the **group of the wave vector**, $G_{\vec{k}}$, a subgroup tailored to this exact purpose. This article provides a comprehensive exploration of this essential tool. The first chapter, **Principles and Mechanisms**, will lay the theoretical groundwork, defining $G_{\vec{k}}$ and its [irreducible representations](@entry_id:138184), which dictate band degeneracies. Subsequently, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections** will demonstrate its predictive power in areas ranging from spectroscopy and phase transitions to modern [topological materials](@entry_id:142123). Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** section will offer concrete problems to reinforce these concepts, allowing readers to apply the theory themselves.

## Principles and Mechanisms

In the study of crystalline solids, the [periodicity](@entry_id:152486) of the lattice dictates that the electronic wavefunctions, according to Bloch's theorem, are [eigenstates](@entry_id:149904) of the [translation operator](@entry_id:756122), characterized by a [wave vector](@entry_id:272479) $\vec{k}$. The symmetry of the crystal, described by its space group, imposes profound constraints on the properties of these electronic states, such as the structure of the energy bands and the degeneracies of the energy levels. While the full space group describes the symmetry of the crystal as a whole, for an electronic state with a specific [wave vector](@entry_id:272479) $\vec{k}$, the relevant [symmetry group](@entry_id:138562) is a smaller subgroup known as the group of the [wave vector](@entry_id:272479). This chapter elucidates the definition, properties, and applications of this crucial concept.

### The Group of the Wave Vector

For a given [wave vector](@entry_id:272479) $\vec{k}$ in the Brillouin zone, not all [symmetry operations](@entry_id:143398) of the crystal's space group will leave the Bloch function's phase factor $\exp(i\vec{k} \cdot \vec{r})$ invariant. The subset of operations that do form a group, which is the key to classifying the electronic states at that $\vec{k}$.

We define the **group of the [wave vector](@entry_id:272479)** $\vec{k}$, denoted $G_{\vec{k}}$, as the subgroup of the space group $G$ consisting of all operations $\{R | \vec{v}\}$ whose rotational part $R$ leaves $\vec{k}$ either invariant or transforms it into an equivalent vector by the addition of a [reciprocal lattice vector](@entry_id:276906) $\vec{K}$:
$R\vec{k} = \vec{k} + \vec{K}$.

The set of all distinct rotational parts $R$ from the elements of $G_{\vec{k}}$ forms a [point group](@entry_id:145002), known as the **[point group](@entry_id:145002) of the [wave vector](@entry_id:272479)** or the **little co-group**, which we denote as $P_{\vec{k}}$. This group is a subgroup of the crystal's full [point group](@entry_id:145002), $G_0$. The order of $P_{\vec{k}}$ and its relationship to the full [point group](@entry_id:145002) $G_0$ provide fundamental insights into the symmetry of the electronic structure.

As a concrete example, consider a simple cubic (SC) lattice, whose point group is the full cubic group $O_h$ of order $|G_0|=48$. The first Brillouin zone is a cube. Let us examine a general point on the $\Delta$ line, which connects the zone center $\Gamma$ to the face-center X. Such a point has coordinates $\vec{k}_\Delta = (k, 0, 0)$ with $0  k  \pi/a$. To find the point group of this wave vector, $P_{\vec{k}_\Delta}$, we must identify all rotational operations $R$ in $O_h$ that leave $\vec{k}_\Delta$ invariant. Since the point is not on the Brillouin zone boundary, the condition simplifies to $R\vec{k}_\Delta = \vec{k}_\Delta$. The operations that leave the vector $(k,0,0)$ invariant are rotations about the x-axis and reflections in planes containing the x-axis. These operations form the [point group](@entry_id:145002) $C_{4v}$ (in Schoenflies notation), which has 8 elements: the identity, two $C_4$ rotations, one $C_2$ rotation, and four reflections ($\sigma_v$, $\sigma_d$). With $|P_{\vec{k}_\Delta}| = 8$ and $|G_0| = 48$, we can determine the number of distinct wave vectors that are symmetrically equivalent to $\vec{k}_\Delta$.

### The Star of $\vec{k}$

The operations of the full [point group](@entry_id:145002) $G_0$ that are *not* in the little co-group $P_{\vec{k}}$ will transform $\vec{k}$ into a different wave vector $\vec{k}'$. The set of all distinct, inequivalent wave vectors generated by applying all operations of $G_0$ to $\vec{k}$ is known as the **star of $\vec{k}$**.

The number of vectors in the star of $\vec{k}$, denoted $|\text{Star}(\vec{k})|$, is directly related to the orders of the full [point group](@entry_id:145002) and the little co-group through the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem. The set of operations in $G_0$ can be partitioned into [cosets](@entry_id:147145) of the subgroup $P_{\vec{k}}$. The number of such [cosets](@entry_id:147145), which is the index of $P_{\vec{k}}$ in $G_0$, is precisely the number of vectors in the star:
$|\text{Star}(\vec{k})| = \frac{|G_0|}{|P_{\vec{k}}|}$.

For our previous example of a point on the $\Delta$ line in the SC lattice, the size of the star is $|\text{Star}(\vec{k}_\Delta)| = \frac{48}{8} = 6$. These six vectors correspond to the six $\Delta$ lines along the $\pm x, \pm y, \pm z$ directions, e.g., $(\pm k, 0, 0)$, $(0, \pm k, 0)$, and $(0, 0, \pm k)$. All wavefunctions and [energy eigenvalues](@entry_id:144381) at any point in a star are related by [symmetry operations](@entry_id:143398); thus, one only needs to calculate the band structure for one representative vector from each star. The collection of these representative vectors forms the **irreducible wedge** of the Brillouin zone.

A physically relevant construction can be made from the vectors in a star. For instance, consider the K-point in the Brillouin zone of a 2D hexagonal lattice. The K-points are at the corners of the hexagonal zone. Applying the rotational symmetries of the lattice (the $D_6$ group) to a single K-vector generates the star of K, which consists of two vectors (K and the inequivalent K'). The set of all six corner points of the Brillouin zone is the union of the star of K and the star of K'. A physical quantity, such as a [second-rank tensor](@entry_id:199780), constructed by summing over all six of these corner vectors, must be invariant under the symmetries of the lattice. For example, the tensor $M_{ij} = \sum_{\mathbf{k} \in \text{all 6 corners}} k_i k_j$ must be isotropic in 2D, i.e., $M_{xx}=M_{yy}$ and $M_{xy}=0$. The trace is then simply $\text{Tr}(M) = \sum_{\mathbf{k} \in \text{all 6 corners}} |\mathbf{k}|^2$, which can be computed by finding the squared magnitude of one vector and multiplying by 6.

### Irreducible Representations and Band Degeneracy

The electronic wavefunctions $\psi_{n, \vec{k}}$ at a given [wave vector](@entry_id:272479) $\vec{k}$ must transform according to the irreducible representations (irreps) of the group of the wave vector, $G_{\vec{k}}$. If an irrep is $d$-dimensional, there must be $d$ linearly independent wavefunctions at that $\vec{k}$ which all have the same energy. This is known as an **[essential degeneracy](@entry_id:189546)** or [symmetry-required degeneracy](@entry_id:202890). The dimension of the irrep dictates the degeneracy of the corresponding energy band at that point.

It is important to distinguish this from **[accidental degeneracy](@entry_id:141689)**, which is a crossing or touching of [energy bands](@entry_id:146576) that is not required by the [space group symmetry](@entry_id:204211). Such degeneracies can occur for a specific crystal potential but will typically be lifted by a small perturbation. A special case of systematic, but not strictly essential, degeneracy occurs in the **[empty lattice approximation](@entry_id:142756)**, where the crystal potential is set to zero. Here, the energy is simply $E(\vec{k}) = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m_e}|\vec{k} + \vec{G}|^2$, where $\vec{G}$ is a [reciprocal lattice vector](@entry_id:276906). For a given $\vec{k}$, degeneracy arises whenever multiple vectors $\vec{G}$ result in the same value of $|\vec{k} + \vec{G}|^2$.

For example, at the X-point $\vec{k}_X = \frac{2\pi}{a}(1,0,0)$ of an FCC lattice (whose reciprocal lattice is BCC), the energy levels are proportional to $|\vec{k}_X + \vec{G}|^2$. Here, $\vec{G}$ is a [reciprocal lattice vector](@entry_id:276906) of the form $\frac{2\pi}{a}(h,k,l)$, where $h,k,l$ are integers whose sum $h+k+l$ is even. The energy is proportional to $n = (h+1)^2+k^2+l^2$. The lowest energy occurs for $\vec{G}=(0,0,0)$ (sum is 0, even), which gives $\vec{k}_X+\vec{G}=\frac{2\pi}{a}(1,0,0)$ and $n=1$. Another [reciprocal lattice vector](@entry_id:276906), $\vec{G}=\frac{2\pi}{a}(-2,0,0)$ (sum is -2, even), gives $\vec{k}_X+\vec{G}=\frac{2\pi}{a}(-1,0,0)$ and also yields $n=(-1)^2=1$. Thus, the lowest energy level is two-fold degenerate. The second-lowest energy level comes from the set of [reciprocal lattice vectors](@entry_id:263351) like $\vec{G}=\frac{2\pi}{a}(0,1,1)$ (sum is 2, even). This gives $\vec{k}_X+\vec{G}=\frac{2\pi}{a}(1,1,1)$ and $n=1^2+1^2+1^2=3$. There are four such vectors, $\vec{G}=\frac{2\pi}{a}(0, \pm 1, \pm 1)$, that all yield $n=3$. Therefore, the second-lowest energy level has a degeneracy of 4. These degeneracies of the [free electron model](@entry_id:147685) form the "scaffolding" upon which a weak [periodic potential](@entry_id:140652) builds the true [band structure](@entry_id:139379), creating gaps at the Brillouin zone boundaries.

To determine the irreps that classify the [energy bands](@entry_id:146576), one often starts with a set of basis functions, such as atomic orbitals in the Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO) method, and determines the representation they form. This representation is generally reducible and must be decomposed into its irrep components using the **character [projection formula](@entry_id:152164)**. For a representation $\Gamma$ and an irrep $\alpha$, the number of times $\alpha$ appears in $\Gamma$, $n_\alpha$, is given by:
$$ n_\alpha = \frac{1}{|P_{\vec{k}}|} \sum_{R \in P_{\vec{k}}} \chi_{\Gamma}(R)^* \chi_{\alpha}(R) $$
where $|P_{\vec{k}}|$ is the order of the little [point group](@entry_id:145002), and $\chi(R)$ are the characters of the operations $R$.

For instance, consider a general point on the $\Sigma$ line in the Brillouin zone of a BCC crystal, with [wave vector](@entry_id:272479) $\vec{k}=(k_0, k_0, 0)$. The little point group is $C_{2v}$. A [vector basis](@entry_id:191419) $(\hat{x}, \hat{y}, \hat{z})$ furnishes a 3D representation, $\Gamma_{vec}$. By finding the trace of the transformation matrices for each symmetry operation in $C_{2v}$, we obtain the characters of $\Gamma_{vec}$. Applying the [projection formula](@entry_id:152164) reveals how this representation decomposes, e.g., $\Gamma_{vec} = A_1 \oplus B_1 \oplus B_2$. This tells us that a vector-like state (like a p-orbital) would split into three non-degenerate bands at this point in [k-space](@entry_id:142033). A similar analysis for atomic p-orbitals at the X-point of a [simple cubic lattice](@entry_id:160687) ([little group](@entry_id:198763) $D_{4h}$) shows that the three p-orbitals split into a 1D irrep ($A_{2u}$) and a 2D irrep ($E_u$), indicating that two of the p-bands will be degenerate at the X-point.

### Advanced Applications: Selection Rules and Compatibility

The framework of group theory extends to analyzing interactions and the connectivity of bands throughout the Brillouin zone.

#### Direct Product Representations and Selection Rules

Physical processes that cause transitions between [electronic states](@entry_id:171776), such as the absorption of a photon or scattering by a phonon, are mediated by an interaction operator. A transition from an initial state $|\psi_i\rangle$ to a final state $|\psi_f\rangle$ is allowed only if the matrix element $\langle\psi_f | \hat{H}_{int} | \psi_i \rangle$ is non-zero. Group theory provides a powerful shortcut: the integral is non-zero only if the direct product representation of the initial and final states, $\Gamma_f^* \otimes \Gamma_i$, contains the representation of the interaction operator, $\Gamma_{int}$. Often, we are interested in whether the totally symmetric representation ($A_1$ or $\Gamma_1$) is present in the [triple product](@entry_id:195882) $\Gamma_f^* \otimes \Gamma_{int} \otimes \Gamma_i$.

The characters of a **[direct product](@entry_id:143046) representation** $\Gamma_A \otimes \Gamma_B$ are simply the product of the characters of the constituent representations: $\chi_{A \otimes B}(R) = \chi_A(R) \chi_B(R)$. This new representation can then be decomposed into irreps using the [projection formula](@entry_id:152164). As an example, at the P-point of a BCC lattice (little group $T_d$), if we consider two bands transforming as irreps $P_4$ and $P_5$, the interactions between them are governed by the [direct product](@entry_id:143046) $\Gamma = P_4 \otimes P_5$. By calculating the product characters and decomposing $\Gamma$, we find which final states are accessible from this combined state. In this case, one finds $\Gamma = P_2 \oplus P_3 \oplus P_4 \oplus P_5$, revealing the symmetry of the resulting states.

#### Compatibility Relations

The symmetry of the wave vector changes as it moves through the Brillouin zone. A point of high symmetry (like $\Gamma$, with group $O_h$) is adjacent to lines of lower symmetry (like the $\Delta$ line, with group $C_{4v}$). Since $C_{4v}$ is a subgroup of $O_h$, any irrep of $O_h$ can be treated as a representation of $C_{4v}$. This representation is not necessarily irreducible and its decomposition into the irreps of the subgroup establishes the **[compatibility relations](@entry_id:184577)**. These relations dictate how degenerate bands at high-symmetry points must split as the [wave vector](@entry_id:272479) moves onto an adjacent line or plane.

For example, consider the triply-degenerate $T_{2g}$ irrep at the $\Gamma$-point of a BCC lattice (group $O_h$). To find its compatibility with the $\Delta$ line (group $C_{4v}$), we take the characters of $T_{2g}$ for only those operations that are also in $C_{4v}$. Using the [projection formula](@entry_id:152164) for the subgroup $C_{4v}$, we find that the $T_{2g}$ representation decomposes as $T_{2g} \downarrow C_{4v} = B_2 \oplus E$. Since $B_2$ is 1D and $E$ is 2D, this means a triply-degenerate band at $\Gamma$ with $T_{2g}$ symmetry will split into a non-degenerate band and a doubly-degenerate band along the $\Delta$ direction. These relations are essential for correctly connecting the energy levels in a [band structure](@entry_id:139379) diagram.

### The Role of Non-Symmorphic Symmetries

A space group is **non-symmorphic** if it contains essential [glide planes](@entry_id:182991) or screw axes, which are symmetry operations combining a [point group](@entry_id:145002) operation (reflection or rotation) with a non-primitive translation (a fraction of a lattice vector). These non-primitive translations introduce profound new physics.

In [non-symmorphic groups](@entry_id:200912), the representations of $G_{\vec{k}}$ are no longer simple representations of the little [point group](@entry_id:145002) $P_{\vec{k}}$. Instead, they become **[projective representations](@entry_id:143236)** (or **ray representations**). The composition of two operations in $G_{\vec{k}}$ can result in a pure lattice translation, $\{R_1|\vec{v}_1\}\{R_2|\vec{v}_2\} = \{R_1R_2|\vec{v}_1+R_1\vec{v}_2\}$. The representation of this operation, $D(\{R_1|\vec{v}_1\})D(\{R_2|\vec{v}_2\})$, must be related to the representation of the product, $D(\{R_1R_2|\vec{v}_1+R_1\vec{v}_2\})$. This leads to a multiplication rule for the representative matrices $\Delta(R)$ of the point group elements:
$$ \Delta(R_i) \Delta(R_j) = \omega(R_i, R_j) \Delta(R_i R_j) $$
The phase factors $\omega(R_i, R_j)$ are called the **factor system**. When these factors are not all 1, the representation is projective. The factor system can be calculated from the [wave vector](@entry_id:272479) $\vec{k}$ and the non-primitive translations:
$$ \omega(R_i, R_j) = \exp \left[ -i (\vec{k} + \vec{K}) \cdot (\mathbf{v}_{i} + R_i\mathbf{v}_{j} - \mathbf{v}_{ij}) \right] $$
where $\mathbf{v}_{i}$ is the non-primitive translation for operation $R_i$, and $R_i R_j = R_{ij}$. If, for instance, we calculate $\omega(C_2(x), C_2(x))$ for the X-point $\vec{k}=(\pi/a, 0, 0)$ in a non-symmorphic group containing a [screw axis](@entry_id:268289) $\{C_{2x}|\frac{a}{2}\hat{x}\}$, we find the result is $-1$. This implies that the representation matrix for $C_2(x)$ must satisfy $\Delta(C_2(x))^2 = -I$, where $I$ is the identity matrix.

This algebraic constraint has a crucial consequence: a 1D representation (a scalar) cannot satisfy this property, as $c^2=-1$ has no solution for a single complex number in the character. Therefore, the dimension of the irrep must be greater than one. This forces degeneracies in the band structure, a phenomenon known as **band sticking**.

A classic example occurs in the diamond lattice ([space group](@entry_id:140010) $Fd\bar{3}m$) at the X-point, $\vec{k}_X = \frac{2\pi}{a}(1,0,0)$. The group $G_{\vec{k}_X}$ contains non-symmorphic operations. Consider a glide reflection $g_1 = \{m_z | \frac{a}{4}(1,1,0)\}$ and a screw rotation $g_2 = \{C_{2z} | \frac{a}{2}(1,1,0)\}$. By analyzing the composition of these operations, we find their corresponding representation matrices, $A=D(g_1)$ and $B=D(g_2)$, must satisfy the algebra $A^2=-I$, $B^2=I$, and $AB=-BA$. The [anticommutation](@entry_id:182725) relation $AB=-BA$ immediately rules out any 1D representation. Thus, all irreps at the X-point in the diamond lattice must be at least two-dimensional, guaranteeing that all bands are at least two-fold degenerate there.

Similarly, in the [hcp structure](@entry_id:158679) ($P6_3/mmc$), the glide operation $g_c = \{\sigma_h | (0,0,c/2)\}$ is a member of the little group for any wave vector on the top face of the Brillouin zone (the AHL plane), where $k_z = \pi/c$. For any such $\vec{k}$, the representation of this glide operation can be shown to satisfy $D_{\vec{k}}(g_c)^2 = \exp(-ik_z c)I = \exp(-i\pi)I = -I$. This, combined with time-reversal symmetry, forces every single energy band to be at least two-fold degenerate across the entire AHL face of the Brillouin zone. This is a remarkable and physically important consequence of [non-symmorphic symmetry](@entry_id:187421), with direct implications for the electronic and topological properties of materials with these structures.
