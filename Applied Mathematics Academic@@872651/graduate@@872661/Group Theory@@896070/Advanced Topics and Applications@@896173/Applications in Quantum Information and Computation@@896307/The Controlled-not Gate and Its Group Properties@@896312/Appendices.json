Their product, $r=su=CU$, has order 4, so $r^4=I$.\nThis structure is characteristic of a dihedral group. The dihedral group $D_n$ is the group of symmetries of a regular n-gon, with order $2n$. It can be presented by generators $s$ (a reflection) and $r$ (a rotation) satisfying the relations:\n$$ s^2 = I, \\quad r^n = I, \\quad srs = r^{-1} $$\nIn our case, we set $s=C$ and $r=CU$. We have $s^2=I$ and $r^4=I$, so $n=4$. We must verify the third relation, $srs=r^{-1}$.\nFirst, calculate $r^{-1}$:\n$$\nr^{-1} = (CU)^{-1} = U^{-1}C^{-1}\n$$\nSince $C$ and $U$ have order 2, they are their own inverses ($C^{-1}=C$, $U^{-1}=U$).\n$$\nr^{-1} = UC\n$$\nNow, calculate $srs$:\n$$\nsrs = C(CU)C = C^2UC = IUC = UC\n$$\nSince $srs = r^{-1}$, the relations for the dihedral group $D_4$ are satisfied. The group $G = \\langle C, U \\rangle$ is isomorphic to $D_4$. The generators $s=C$ and $r=CU$ are sufficient to generate the entire group because the original generator $U$ can be recovered: $sr = C(CU) = C^2U = U$.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the order of the group**\nThe order of the dihedral group $D_n$ is $2n$. For our group, which is isomorphic to $D_4$, $n=4$.\nThe order is $2 \\times 4 = 8$.\n\nThe 8 distinct elements of the group are given by $\\{I, r, r^2, r^3, s, sr, sr^2, sr^3\\}$ which correspond to $\\{I, CU, (CU)^2, (CU)^3, C, U, C(CU)^2, C(CU)^3\\}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{8}\n$$", "id": "802873"}]}
