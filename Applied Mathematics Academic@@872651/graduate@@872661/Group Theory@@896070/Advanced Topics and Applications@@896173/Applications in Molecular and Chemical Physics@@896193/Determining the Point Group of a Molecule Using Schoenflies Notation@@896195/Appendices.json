Its carbon skeleton consists of two bridgehead carbon atoms ($C_1$ and $C_4$) which are connected by three separate two-carbon-atom bridges ($-CH_2-CH_2-$).\n\nIn an idealized, high-symmetry conformation, the molecule could be imagined with the atoms of the bridges eclipsed when viewed along the $C_1-C_4$ axis. However, due to torsional strain, the ground-state conformation of the molecule is known to be twisted. In this stable conformation, the three bridges are twisted symmetrically around the axis passing through the two bridgehead carbons, resembling a three-bladed propeller.\n\nYour task is to analyze the symmetry of this ground-state (twisted) conformation of bicyclo[2.2.2]octane. First, determine its Schoenflies point group.

We identify the symmetry elements of this structure:\n\n1.  **Identity ($E$)**: Every molecule has the identity element, which corresponds to no change.\n\n2.  **Rotation Axes ($C_n$)**: There is a single two-fold rotation axis ($C_2$) that passes through the central sulfur atom.
