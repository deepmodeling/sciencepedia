The underlying symmetry arguments are as follows.\n\nA vibrational mode is IR active if it transforms as any of the Cartesian coordinates $x$, $y$, or $z$, i.e., if it has the same symmetry as the dipole moment components. A vibrational mode is Raman active if it transforms as any quadratic form $x^{2}$, $y^{2}$, $z^{2}$, $xy$, $xz$, or $yz$, i.e., like the components of the polarizability tensor.\n\nUnder inversion $i$, the coordinates transform as $x \\to -x$, $y \\to -y$, $z \\to -z$, so $x$, $y$, $z$ are ungerade ($u$). Quadratic forms transform as $x^{2} \\to x^{2}$, $xy \\to xy$, etc., so they are gerade ($g$). In a centrosymmetric molecule, each normal mode has a definite $g/u$ parity. Therefore:\n- IR-active modes must be $u$.\n- Raman-active modes must be $g$.\nNo mode can be both $g$ and $u$, so no vibrational mode can be simultaneously IR and Raman active. This is the rule of mutual exclusion.\n\nWe now identify which listed molecules are centrosymmetric:\n1. $N_{2}$ is a linear homonuclear diatomic with point group $D_{\\infty h}$ and has an inversion center $i$.

This practice focuses on the highly symmetric 'breathing' mode of benzene, a classic example used to build intuition for the rule of mutual exclusion.

Benzene is a planar, aromatic molecule that possesses a center of inversion (i.e., it is centrosymmetric). One of the fundamental vibrational modes of the benzene molecule is the symmetric ring \"breathing\" mode, where all six carbon atoms simultaneously move radially outward from the center of the ring and then simultaneously move radially inward.

The activity of a molecule's fundamental vibrational modes in Infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopy is governed by selection rules determined by molecular symmetry. A vibrational mode is IR active if it corresponds to a change in the molecule's dipole moment, and it is Raman active if it corresponds to a change in the molecule's polarizability. In terms of group theory, a mode is IR active if its irreducible representation (irrep) transforms as one of the Cartesian coordinates ($x, y, z$), and Raman active if its irrep transforms as one of the quadratic functions ($x^2, y^2, z^2, xy, xz, yz$).\n\nFor molecules that possess a center of inversion ($i$), the rule of mutual exclusion states that vibrational modes cannot be both IR and Raman active. Vibrations that are symmetric with respect to inversion (gerade, subscript $g$) can be Raman active, while vibrations that are antisymmetric (ungerade, subscript $u$) can be IR active. Some vibrational modes may be inactive in both IR and Raman spectra; these are known as \"silent\" modes.\n\nConsider a hypothetical molecule $\\text{AB}_2\\text{C}_6$ with $D_{3d}$ point group symmetry.

They form two equilateral triangles centered on the $z$-axis, in planes above and below the $xy$-plane.
