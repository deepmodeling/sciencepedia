An electrocyclic reaction involves the intramolecular formation or breaking of a single $\\sigma$ bond between the termini of a linear conjugated $\\pi$ system. The stereochemical course of such a reaction, whether conrotatory or disrotatory, is determined by the symmetry of the frontier molecular orbitals.\n\nFor a thermal reaction, the symmetry of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the reactant is key. In a symmetry-allowed process, the HOMO of the reactant must transform into the HOMO of the product while maintaining its symmetry with respect to the symmetry elements preserved along the reaction pathway.\n\nA conrotatory motion preserves a $C_2$ axis of rotation throughout the reaction. This axis passes through the midpoint of the forming/breaking $\\sigma$ bond and is lying in the plane of the developing $\\pi$ system.

This reaction proceeds through a concerted mechanism involving a 6-electron, 5-atom cyclic transition state.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, we will model the transition state using fundamental principles of group theory and molecular orbital theory. Consider the core atomic backbone involved in the rearrangement: C(1)-O(2)-C(3)-C(4)-C(5). The transition state geometry is assumed to possess $C_s$ symmetry. This is a common and reasonable approximation, often described as an \"envelope\" conformation where the oxygen atom O(2) is the \"flap\". The plane of symmetry, $\\sigma$, passes through the oxygen atom O(2) and simultaneously bisects the C(1)-C(3) and C(4)-C(5) atom pairs. Thus, the reflection operation exchanges C(1) with C(3) and C(4) with C(5), while O(2) remains fixed.\n\nThe frontier molecular orbitals of this transition state can be constructed from a basis set of five atomic p-orbitals, one on each atom of the C-O-C-C-C backbone.
