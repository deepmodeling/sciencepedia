This foundational practice is essential for building a solid understanding of the connection between molecular symmetry and vibrational spectroscopy.", "problem": "Phosphoryl chloride ($POCl_3$) is a molecule with a central phosphorus atom bonded to an oxygen atom and three chlorine atoms. The molecule adopts a geometry where the oxygen atom lies on a threefold rotational axis ($C_3$) passing through the phosphorus atom. The three chlorine atoms are arranged symmetrically around this axis, forming the base of a trigonal pyramid with the phosphorus atom at its apex. This molecular structure belongs to the $C_{3v}$ point group.\n\nThe analysis of molecular vibrations using group theory allows for the prediction of which vibrational modes are active in infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopy. A vibrational mode is infrared-active if it causes a change in the molecule's dipole moment. The polarization of an IR-active mode is determined by the direction of this change.\n\n**Necessary Information:**\n\n1.  **Character Table for the $C_{3v}$ Point Group:**\n    | $C_{3v}$  | $E$ | $2C_3$ | $3\\sigma_v$ | Linear, Rotational |\n    |---|---|---|---|---|\n    | $A_1$  | 1 | 1 | 1 | $z$ |\n    | $A_2$  | 1 | 1 | -1 | $R_z$ |\n    | $E$    | 2 | -1 | 0 | $(x, y), (R_x, R_y)$ |\n\n2.  **Reducible Representation $\\Gamma_{3N}$:**\n    The total motion of the $N$ atoms in the molecule can be described by a reducible representation, $\\Gamma_{3N}$.
