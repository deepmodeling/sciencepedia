The discrete symmetries of charge conjugation (C), parity inversion (P), and time reversal (T) are crucial for understanding the nature of particle interactions. The parity transformation, $P$, corresponds to the inversion of spatial coordinates: $\\vec{x} \\to -\\vec{x}$. In a quantum field theory, this transformation is represented by a unitary operator, $\\hat{P}$. Since applying the parity transformation twice returns the system to its original state, the operator must satisfy $\\hat{P}^2 = \\hat{I}$ (where $\\hat{I}$ is the identity operator). This algebraic property implies that the eigenvalues of $\\hat{P}$ are restricted to be $\\pm 1$.\n\nThe action of $\\hat{P}$ on a quantum state can be analyzed by considering its constituent parts. For a system of particles, the total parity is a multiplicative quantum number. Consider a composite system of two distinct particles, A and B. The total parity, $P_{total}$, of the system is the product of three factors:\n1.  The intrinsic parity of particle A, $\\eta_A$. This is an inherent property of the particle type, representing the eigenvalue of $\\hat{P}$ on the particle's state vector at rest.\n2.  The intrinsic parity of particle B, $\\eta_B$.\n3.  The orbital parity, $P_{orbital}$, which arises from the relative motion of the two particles. For a state with a well-defined relative orbital angular momentum quantum number $L$, the orbital parity is given by $P_{orbital} = (-1)^L$.\n\nThus, the total parity of the two-particle system is the eigenvalue of the total parity operator, given by the product $P_{total} = \\eta_A \\cdot \\eta_B \\cdot (-1)^L$.\n\nBy convention and experimental observation, the intrinsic parities of baryons (like the proton, $p$) are defined as positive, while pseudoscalar mesons (like the neutral pion, $\\pi^0$) have negative intrinsic parity. Specifically:\n- The intrinsic parity of a proton is $\\eta_p = +1$.\n- The intrinsic parity of a neutral pion is $\\eta_{\\pi^0} = -1$.\n\nA proton and a neutral pion form a composite system where their relative motion is described by a P-wave state. In spectroscopic notation, S, P, D, F, ... waves correspond to orbital angular momentum quantum numbers $L=0, 1, 2, 3, ...$ respectively.\n\nDerive the numerical value of the total parity, $P_{total}$, for this proton-pion system.", "solution": "We use the formula for the total parity of a two-particle system:  \n1.
