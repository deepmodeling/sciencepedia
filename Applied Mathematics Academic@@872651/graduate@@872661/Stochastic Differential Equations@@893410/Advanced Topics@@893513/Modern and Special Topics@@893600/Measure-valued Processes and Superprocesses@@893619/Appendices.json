It is a well-posed problem within the mathematical field of stochastic analysis, specifically concerning the theory of measure-valued processes. The objects and properties described, such as the Dawson–Watanabe superprocess, Feller semigroups, and the canonical martingale formulation, are standard and rigorously defined. The problem is self-contained, scientifically grounded, and objective, free from any of the flaws listed in the validation criteria.\n\nWe are tasked with two objectives: first, to derive a closed-form expression for the covariance kernel $K_t(\\phi,\\psi)$, and second, to evaluate this expression for a specific choice of test functions under the condition of trivial spatial motion.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the covariance kernel $K_t(\\phi,\\psi)$. By definition, the covariance is\n$$\nK_t(\\phi,\\psi) := \\mathrm{Cov}(\\langle X_t,\\phi\\rangle, \\langle X_t,\\psi\\rangle) = \\mathbb{E}[\\langle X_t,\\phi\\rangle \\langle X_t,\\psi\\rangle] - \\mathbb{E}[\\langle X_t,\\phi\\rangle]\\mathbb{E}[\\langle X_t,\\psi\\rangle].\n$$\nThe problem states that for any bounded measurable function $\\phi$, the process $M_t(\\phi) := \\langle X_t,\\phi\\rangle - \\langle \\mu,\\phi\\rangle$ is a martingale starting at $M_0(\\phi) = \\langle X_0,\\phi\\rangle - \\langle \\mu,\\phi\\rangle = \\langle \\mu,\\phi\\rangle - \\langle \\mu,\\phi\\rangle = 0$.\nA fundamental property of martingales starting at $0$ is that their expectation is $0$ for all time $t \\ge 0$.

This implies\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\langle X_t,\\phi\\rangle - \\langle \\mu,\\phi\\rangle] = 0 \\implies \\mathbb{E}[\\langle X_t,\\phi\\rangle] = \\langle \\mu,\\phi\\rangle.\n$$\nThis holds for any bounded measurable test function. Using this, the covariance expression can be rewritten in terms of the martingale $M_t$:\n$$\nK_t(\\phi,\\psi) = \\mathbb{E}[(\\langle X_t,\\phi\\rangle - \\langle \\mu,\\phi\\rangle)(\\langle X_t,\\psi\\rangle - \\langle \\mu,\\psi\\rangle)] = \\mathbb{E}[M_t(\\phi)M_t(\\psi)].\n$$\nThe process $M_t$ is given as a square-integrable martingale. A key property of square-integrable martingales is the martingale isometry, which relates the second moment of the martingale at time $t$ to the expectation of its predictable quadratic covariation process up to time $t$. Specifically, $\\mathbb{E}[M_t(\\phi)M_t(\\psi)] = \\mathbb{E}[\\langle M(\\phi),M(\\psi)\\rangle_t]$.\nThe problem provides the form of the predictable quadratic covariation:\n$$\n\\langle M(\\phi),M(\\psi)\\rangle_t = \\int_0^t \\langle X_s,\\phi\\,\\psi\\rangle\\,ds.\n$$\nCombining these facts, we have\n$$\nK_t(\\phi,\\psi) = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_0^t \\langle X_s,\\phi\\,\\psi\\rangle\\,ds\\right].\n$$\nUsing the Tonelli-Fubini theorem, we can interchange the expectation and the time integral:\n$$\nK_t(\\phi,\\psi) = \\int_0^t \\mathbb{E}[\\langle X_s,\\phi\\,\\psi\\rangle]\\,ds.\n$$\nThe expectation $\\mathbb{E}[\\langle X_s, f \\rangle]$ for a general superprocess is given by $\\langle \\mu, P_s f \\rangle$, where $\\{P_s\\}$ is the Feller semigroup of the underlying spatial motion. Applying this with the test function $f = \\phi\\psi$, we get\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\langle X_s,\\phi\\,\\psi\\rangle] = \\langle \\mu, P_s(\\phi\\psi)\\rangle.\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the integral gives one form of the covariance kernel:\n$$\nK_t(\\phi,\\psi) = \\int_0^t \\langle \\mu, P_s(\\phi\\psi)\\rangle\\,ds.\n$$\nThe problem asks for the expression in the form $\\int_0^t \\langle P_{t-s}\\mu,\\phi\\,\\psi\\rangle\\,ds$. We can show the equivalence. By the duality property of the Feller semigroup, $\\langle \\nu, P_u f \\rangle = \\langle P_u \\nu, f \\rangle$ for any measure $\\nu$ and function $f$. Thus, $\\langle \\mu, P_{t-s}(\\phi\\psi)\\rangle = \\langle P_{t-s}\\mu, \\phi\\psi\\rangle$. So we can write\n$$\n\\int_0^t \\langle P_{t-s}\\mu,\\phi\\,\\psi\\rangle\\,ds.\n$$\nTo show this is equivalent to our derived form, perform a change of variables $u = t-s$ in this integral. Then $s = t-u$ and $ds = -du$. The limits of integration change from $s=0$ to $u=t$ and from $s=t$ to $u=0$.\n$$\n\\int_{t}^{0} \\langle P_{u}\\mu,\\phi\\,\\psi\\rangle\\,(-du) = \\int_{0}^{t} \\langle P_u \\mu, \\phi\\psi \\rangle\\,du = \\int_{0}^{t} \\langle \\mu, P_u(\\phi\\psi) \\rangle\\,du.\n$$\nThis confirms the validity of the expression given in the problem statement.\n\nNow, we proceed to the second part of the task. We must evaluate this expression for the specific case of trivial spatial motion and for the test functions $\\phi = \\psi = \\mathbf{1}_A$.\nTrivial spatial motion implies that the generator of the motion is the zero operator. The corresponding Feller semigroup is $P_t = \\exp(t \\cdot 0) = I$, where $I$ is the identity operator. This means $P_t f = f$ for any bounded measurable function $f$ and for all $t \\ge 0$.\nThe problem explicitly states this as $P_t f=f$ and $P_t \\mu = \\mu$. Let's use the first derived form of the covariance kernel for simplicity:\n$$\nK_t(\\phi,\\psi) = \\int_0^t \\langle \\mu, P_s(\\phi\\psi)\\rangle\\,ds.\n$$\nSubstituting $P_s(\\phi\\psi) = \\phi\\psi$, the expression simplifies to\n$$\nK_t(\\phi,\\psi) = \\int_0^t \\langle \\mu, \\phi\\psi\\rangle\\,ds.\n$$\nSince the integrand $\\langle \\mu, \\phi\\psi\\rangle = \\int \\phi(x)\\psi(x)\\,\\mu(dx)$ does not depend on the integration variable $s$, we can evaluate the integral directly:\n$$\nK_t(\\phi,\\psi) = \\langle \\mu, \\phi\\psi\\rangle \\int_0^t ds = t \\langle \\mu, \\phi\\psi\\rangle.\n$$\nNow, we set $\\phi = \\mathbf{1}_A$ and $\\psi = \\mathbf{1}_A$, where $\\mathbf{1}_A$ is the indicator function of a Borel set $A \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$. The product of the test functions is $\\phi\\psi = \\mathbf{1}_A \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_A = \\mathbf{1}_A^2$. Since the indicator function takes values in $\\{0, 1\\}$, we have $\\mathbf{1}_A^2 = \\mathbf{1}_A$.\nSubstituting this into our simplified expression for the kernel:\n$$\nK_t(\\mathbf{1}_A,\\mathbf{1}_A) = t \\langle \\mu, \\mathbf{1}_A\\rangle.\n$$\nThe term $\\langle \\mu, \\mathbf{1}_A\\rangle$ is, by definition of the notation, the integral of the function $\\mathbf{1}_A$ with respect to the measure $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\langle \\mu, \\mathbf{1}_A\\rangle = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^d} \\mathbf{1}_A(x)\\,\\mu(dx) = \\int_A \\mu(dx) = \\mu(A).\n$$\nThis is the measure of the set $A$ under the initial measure $\\mu$.\nTherefore, the final expression for the covariance is\n$$\nK_t(\\mathbf{1}_A,\\mathbf{1}_A) = t \\mu(A).\n$$\nThis quantity represents the variance of the mass of the superprocess within the set $A$ at time $t$, i.e., $\\mathrm{Var}(\\langle X_t, \\mathbf{1}_A \\rangle) = \\mathrm{Var}(X_t(A))$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{t \\mu(A)}\n$$", "id": "2987507"}, {"introduction": "We conclude by exploring the long-term fate of the population, specifically its probability of extinction within a bounded domain.

There is a potential ambiguity in the term \"extinction probability,\" as a process killed at the boundary could be considered \"extinct.\" However, the problem provides an explicit mathematical characterization of $h(x)$ as the solution to a specific BVP with $h=0$ on the boundary. This suggests the interpretation of $h(x)$ as the probability of extinction *strictly within the domain $D$*, before the process hits the boundary. Under this standard interpretation, a process starting at the boundary has already \"escaped\" (been killed), so its probability of internal extinction is zero, justifying the boundary condition $h(x)=0$.

We may proceed to the solution.\n\nDerivation of the Boundary Value Problem:\n\nThe problem asks to derive the BVP from foundational principles. In the theory of superprocesses, the spatio-temporal dynamics are often analyzed through the logarithmic Laplace functional. For a superprocess $\\{X_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ with spatial motion generator $L$ and branching mechanism $\\psi$, the log-Laplace functional $u(t,x) = -\\ln \\mathbb{E}_{\\delta_x}[\\exp(-\\langle X_t, f \\rangle)]$, where $f$ is a non-negative test function and $\\delta_x$ is the initial state of a unit mass at location $x$, satisfies the evolution equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = L u(t,x) - \\psi(u(t,x))\n$$\nwith initial condition $u(0,x) = f(x)$.\n\nProbabilities of certain long-time events, such as extinction, are related to the stationary solutions of this equation, i.e., solutions to:\n$$\nL u(x) - \\psi(u(x)) = 0\n$$\nA foundational result in the theory states that the probability of extinction *before exiting the domain $D$*, which we denote by $h(x)$, is given by the minimal non-negative solution to this stationary equation, subject to boundary conditions that reflect the process's behavior at $\\partial D$. In this problem, the process is killed upon hitting the boundary. This is interpreted as an \"escape\" rather than an \"internal extinction\". Therefore, a process starting at the boundary $x \\in \\partial D$ has an internal extinction probability of zero. This dictates the Dirichlet boundary condition $h(x) = 0$ for $x \\in \\partial D$.\n\nCombining these elements, we arrive precisely at the BVP stated in the problem: find the minimal non-negative function $h(x)$ satisfying\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}h''(x) - \\beta h(x)^2 = 0 \\quad \\text{for } x \\in (0,a), \\qquad h(0)=0, \\quad h(a)=0.\n$$\n\nSolution of the Boundary Value Problem:\n\nThe ordinary differential equation to solve is:\n$$\nh''(x) = 2\\beta h(x)^2\n$$\nwith boundary conditions $h(0)=0$ and $h(a)=0$. We are looking for the minimal non-negative solution.\n\nFirst, observe that $h(x)=0$ for all $x \\in [0,a]$ is a valid solution:\n- The equation is satisfied: $(0)'' = 2\\beta (0)^2 \\implies 0=0$.\n- The boundary conditions are satisfied: $h(0)=0$ and $h(a)=0$.\n- The solution is non-negative.\n\nNow, we must prove that this is the *only* non-negative solution, which would make it, by definition, the minimal non-negative solution.\n\nLet's assume there exists a non-negative solution $h(x) \\ge 0$. The constant $\\beta$ is given as positive, $\\beta > 0$. From the differential equation, we have:\n$$\nh''(x) = 2\\beta h(x)^2 \\ge 0\n$$\nThe second derivative of $h(x)$ is non-negative for all $x \\in (0,a)$. This implies that the function $h(x)$ is a convex function on the interval $[0,a]$.\n\nA key property of a convex function on a closed interval is that its maximum value must be attained at the boundaries of the interval. For our function $h(x)$ on $[0,a]$, this means:\n$$\n\\max_{x \\in [0,a]} h(x) = \\max\\{h(0), h(a)\\}\n$$\nUsing the boundary conditions $h(0)=0$ and $h(a)=0$, we find:\n$$\n\\max_{x \\in [0,a]} h(x) = \\max\\{0, 0\\} = 0\n$$\nSo, the maximum value of the function $h(x)$ on the interval is $0$.\n\nWe are seeking a non-negative solution, which means $h(x) \\ge 0$ for all $x \\in [0,a]$.\nCombining these two results:\n1.  $h(x) \\ge 0$ (by the non-negativity requirement)\n2.  $h(x) \\le \\max_{z \\in [0,a]} h(z) = 0$ (from convexity and boundary conditions)\n\nThe only way for $h(x)$ to satisfy both $h(x) \\ge 0$ and $h(x) \\le 0$ simultaneously is for $h(x)$ to be identically zero.\n$$\nh(x) = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } x \\in [0,a]\n$$\nTherefore, the only non-negative solution is the trivial solution $h(x)=0$. This solution is consequently the minimal non-negative solution.\n\nThe physical interpretation of this result is that for a superprocess with this specific branching mechanism and spatial motion, the probability of the population going extinct *before* any lineage hits the boundary is zero, regardless of the starting position $x \\in (0,a)$. The population's tendency to grow and diffuse outwards is strong enough that it is guaranteed to reach the boundary before it can die out internally.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "2987501"}]}
