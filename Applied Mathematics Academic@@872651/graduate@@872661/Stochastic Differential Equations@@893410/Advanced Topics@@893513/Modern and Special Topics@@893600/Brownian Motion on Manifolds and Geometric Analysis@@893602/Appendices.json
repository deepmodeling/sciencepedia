The drift vector is $b = (0, 0)^{\\top}$ and the diffusion matrix is the identity matrix $\\sigma = I$. The matrix $a = \\sigma\\sigma^{\\top}$ is therefore also the identity matrix, $a=I$.\n\nThe generator of this Itô SDE is given by the formula $L f = b \\cdot \\nabla f + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j} a^{ij} \\partial_{i}\\partial_{j} f$.

The metric tensor and its inverse are:\n$$\ng_{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\sin^2(\\theta) \\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad g^{ij} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & \\frac{1}{\\sin^2(\\theta)} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant is $\\det(g) = \\sin^2(\\theta)$, so $\\sqrt{\\det(g)} = \\sin(\\theta)$ for $\\theta \\in (0, \\pi)$.

The naive Itô-model does not describe Brownian motion on the sphere because Itô calculus does not obey the classical chain rule. An SDE with zero drift and identity diffusion in one chart will not, in general, retain this form in another chart.
