It is scientifically grounded in the established mathematical theory of Wiener space and Malliavin calculus. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary definitions and conditions provided to compute the Cameron–Martin norm of the specified path. It is objective and free from ambiguity. Therefore, we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe primary task is to compute the Cameron–Martin norm squared, $\\|h\\|_{H}^{2}$, for a specific piecewise linear path $h \\in H$, and then to interpret this quantity in the context of the calculus on Wiener space.\n\nFirst, we compute the norm. The Cameron–Martin space $H$ is defined as the set of absolutely continuous functions $h: [0,1] \\to \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ with $h(0)=0$ and a square-integrable derivative $\\dot{h} \\in L^{2}([0,1]; \\mathbb{R}^{d})$.

The derivative of this path, $\\dot{h}(t)$, is defined almost everywhere and is piecewise constant. For each subinterval $(t_{i-1}, t_{i}]$, where $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, the derivative is given as a constant vector $\\dot{h}(t) = v_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$.\n\nTo compute the integral for $\\|h\\|_{H}^{2}$, we can partition the integral over the subintervals $[t_{i-1}, t_{i}]$:\n$$\n\\|h\\|_{H}^{2} = \\int_{0}^{1} |\\dot{h}(t)|^{2} \\, \\mathrm{d}t = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\int_{t_{i-1}}^{t_{i}} |\\dot{h}(t)|^{2} \\, \\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nOn each subinterval $[t_{i-1}, t_{i}]$, the integrand $|\\dot{h}(t)|^{2}$ is constant, as $\\dot{h}(t) = v_{i}$ for almost every $t$ in that interval. The value of the integrand is $|v_{i}|^{2}$. Therefore, the integral over a single subinterval is:\n$$\n\\int_{t_{i-1}}^{t_{i}} |\\dot{h}(t)|^{2} \\, \\mathrm{d}t = \\int_{t_{i-1}}^{t_{i}} |v_{i}|^{2} \\, \\mathrm{d}t = |v_{i}|^{2} \\int_{t_{i-1}}^{t_{i}} 1 \\, \\mathrm{d}t = |v_{i}|^{2} (t_{i} - t_{i-1})\n$$\nSumming these contributions over all $n$ subintervals gives the total squared norm:\n$$\n\\|h\\|_{H}^{2} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |v_{i}|^{2} (t_{i} - t_{i-1})\n$$\nThis expression is the closed-form solution for the squared Cameron–Martin norm of the given piecewise linear path.\n\nNext, we interpret this norm as an energy functional in the context of integration by parts on Wiener space. This framework is that of Malliavin calculus.\n\n1.  **Energy of Perturbation and the Gaussian Isometry**: The Cameron–Martin space $H$ is the reproducing kernel Hilbert space associated with the Gaussian process $\\{B_t\\}_{t \\in [0,1]}$. It can be thought of as the \"tangent space\" to the Wiener space $W$ at the origin, representing the directions in which one can deterministically perturb a Brownian path while remaining in a probabilistically \"close\" universe. The norm $\\|h\\|_{H}^{2}$ is a measure of the magnitude of this perturbation. In mechanical systems, the kinetic energy is often proportional to the integral of the squared velocity. Here, $\\dot{h}(t)$ is the \"velocity\" of the perturbation $h$, and $\\|h\\|_{H}^{2} = \\int_0^1 |\\dot{h}(t)|^2 dt$ is precisely the integrated kinetic energy of this perturbation path. Thus, $\\|h\\|_H^2$ represents the energy required to \"create\" the path $h(t)$ from $h(0)=0$.\n\n2.  **Role in Integration by Parts**: The integration by parts formula on Wiener space is the duality relationship between the Malliavin derivative operator, $D$, and its adjoint, the Skorohod integral, $\\delta$. For a random variable $F$ in the domain of $D$ and a process $u$ in the domain of $\\delta$, the formula is $\\mathbb{E}[F \\delta(u)] = \\mathbb{E}[\\langle DF, u \\rangle_{L^{2}([0,1];\\mathbb{R}^{d})}]$.\n    The connection to our problem arises when the integrand $u$ is deterministic and belongs to $L^{2}([0,1];\\mathbb{R}^{d})$. If we define a path $h \\in H$ via $h(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} u(s) \\, \\mathrm{d}s$, then $u = \\dot{h}$. For such a deterministic integrand $\\dot{h}$, the Skorohod integral $\\delta(\\dot{h})$ coincides with the Wiener integral:\n    $$\n    W(h) := \\delta(\\dot{h}) = \\int_{0}^{1} \\langle \\dot{h}(s), \\mathrm{d}B_{s} \\rangle\n    $$\n    The map $h \\mapsto W(h)$ is the first Wiener chaos, which establishes a fundamental isometry between the Hilbert space $H$ and a closed Gaussian subspace of $L^2(W)$. This isometry is expressed as:\n    $$\n    \\mathbb{E}[W(h)W(g)] = \\langle h, g \\rangle_{H}\n    $$\n    Setting $g=h$, we find:\n    $$\n    \\mathbb{E}[W(h)^{2}] = \\|h\\|_{H}^{2}\n    $$\n    This shows that the Cameron–Martin norm squared, $\\|h\\|_{H}^{2}$, is precisely the variance of the Gaussian random variable $W(h)$ obtained by integrating with respect to the Brownian motion along the direction $\\dot{h}$. The entire structure of Malliavin calculus, including the integration by parts formula, is built upon the Hilbert space structure of $(H, \\langle \\cdot, \\cdot \\rangle_H)$. The norm $\\|h\\|_{H}$ is the natural metric that makes this foundational space complete.\n\n3.  **Connection to Cameron-Martin-Girsanov Theorem**: The \"energy\" interpretation is further solidified by the Cameron–Martin theorem. This theorem states that the law of the shifted process $B_t + h(t)$ is absolutely continuous with respect to the law of the original Brownian motion $B_t$ if and only if $h \\in H$. The Radon-Nikodym derivative is given by:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbb{P}_{h}}{\\mathrm{d}\\mathbb{P}}(\\omega) = \\exp\\left( \\int_{0}^{1} \\langle \\dot{h}(s), \\mathrm{d}B_{s}(\\omega) \\rangle - \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{1} |\\dot{h}(s)|^{2} \\, \\mathrm{d}s \\right) = \\exp\\left( W(h)(\\omega) - \\frac{1}{2}\\|h\\|_{H}^{2} \\right)\n    $$\n    The term $\\|h\\|_{H}^{2}$ appears as a deterministic correction factor. It quantifies the \"cost\" of shifting the measure. A larger energy $\\|h\\|_{H}^{2}$ corresponds to a perturbation that makes the law of the shifted process more distinct from the original Wiener measure.\n\nIn summary, $\\|h\\|_{H}^{2}$ is the energy of the deterministic path $h$, a quantity that serves as the fundamental metric on the space of admissible path perturbations. It underpins the Hilbert space structure required for the integration by parts formula of Malliavin calculus and quantifies the variance of the associated Wiener integral and the cost of shifting the Wiener measure.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} |v_{i}|^{2} (t_{i} - t_{i-1})}\n$$", "id": "2980967"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the geometry of path perturbations, we now turn to the central operator of the calculus: the Malliavin derivative.

Stratonovich Form and Vector Fields**\n\nThe given SDE system is in Itô form. Let the state be $z = (x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$. The system can be written as $dZ_{t} = b(Z_{t}) dt + \\sigma(Z_{t}) dW_{t}$, where $Z_t = (X_t, Y_t)$.

The diffusion vector field $V_1$ is the same as the Itô diffusion vector field $\\sigma$. So,\n$$\nV_{1}(x,y) = \\sigma(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe Stratonovich drift vector field $V_0$ is related to the Itô drift $b$ by the correction formula. For a single driving Brownian motion, component-wise, this is:\n$$\nV_{0}^{i} = b^{i} - \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{j=1}^{2} \\sigma^{j} \\frac{\\partial \\sigma^{i}}{\\partial z_{j}}\n$$\nwhere $z_1=x$ and $z_2=y$.

Malliavin Derivatives**\n\nWe compute the Malliavin derivatives of $X_T$ and $Y_T$ with respect to the Brownian path $W$. The Malliavin derivative operator is denoted by $D$, where $D_{s}F$ is a process indexed by $s \\in [0,T]$ for a random variable $F$ on Wiener space.\n\nFirst, we find the integral representation of the processes. With initial conditions $X_0=0$ and $Y_0=0$:\n$$\nX_{t} = \\int_{0}^{t} dW_{u}\n$$\n$$\nY_{t} = \\int_{0}^{t} X_{u} du = \\int_{0}^{t} \\left(\\int_{0}^{u} dW_{v}\\right) du\n$$\nThe Malliavin derivative of an Itô integral $\\int_{0}^{T} H_u dW_u$ is given by $D_s \\int_{0}^{T} H_u dW_u = H_s + \\int_s^T D_s H_u dW_u$. For $X_T = \\int_0^T 1 \\, dW_t$, the integrand $H_t=1$ is deterministic, so its Malliavin derivative is $0$. Therefore, for $s \\in [0,T]$:\n$$\nD_{s} X_{T} = D_{s} \\left(\\int_{0}^{T} 1 \\cdot dW_{u}\\right) = 1\n$$\nThis should be interpreted as the function $\\mathbb{I}_{[0,T]}(s)$.\n\nFor $Y_T = \\int_0^T X_t dt$, we can interchange the Malliavin derivative and the time integral (Fubini's theorem for Malliavin calculus):\n$$\nD_{s} Y_{T} = D_{s} \\left(\\int_{0}^{T} X_{t} dt\\right) = \\int_{0}^{T} (D_{s} X_{t}) dt\n$$\nWe need to compute $D_s X_t$ for $s, t \\in [0,T]$.\n$$\nD_{s} X_{t} = D_{s} \\left(\\int_{0}^{t} 1 \\cdot dW_{u}\\right) = \\mathbb{I}_{[0,t]}(s)\n$$\nThis means $D_{s} X_{t} = 1$ if $0 \\le s \\le t$ and $D_{s} X_{t} = 0$ if $s  t$.\nSubstituting this into the integral for $D_s Y_T$:\n$$\nD_{s} Y_{T} = \\int_{0}^{T} \\mathbb{I}_{[0,t]}(s) dt\n$$\nThe indicator function is non-zero only for $t \\ge s$. Therefore, the integral becomes:\n$$\nD_{s} Y_{T} = \\int_{s}^{T} 1 \\, dt = [t]_{s}^{T} = T-s\n$$\nfor $s \\in [0,T]$.\nSo, the Malliavin derivatives as functions in $L^2([0,T])$ are:\n$$\nD_{\\cdot} X_{T} : s \\mapsto 1, \\quad s \\in [0,T]\n$$\n$$\nD_{\\cdot} Y_{T} : s \\mapsto T-s, \\quad s \\in [0,T]\n$$\n\n**3. Malliavin Covariance Matrix**\n\nThe Malliavin covariance matrix $\\Gamma_T$ has entries $\\Gamma_{T}^{ij} = \\langle D X_{T}^{i}, D X_{T}^{j}\\rangle_{\\mathcal{H}}$, where $X_T^1 = X_T$, $X_T^2 = Y_T$, and the inner product is in $\\mathcal{H} = L^2([0,T])$.\n$$\n\\Gamma_{T} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\langle DX_T, DX_T \\rangle_{\\mathcal{H}}  \\langle DX_T, DY_T \\rangle_{\\mathcal{H}} \\\\ \\langle DY_T, DX_T \\rangle_{\\mathcal{H}}  \\langle DY_T, DY_T \\rangle_{\\mathcal{H}} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe compute each entry:\n$$\n\\Gamma_{T}^{11} = \\int_{0}^{T} (D_{s}X_{T})(D_{s}X_{T}) ds = \\int_{0}^{T} 1 \\cdot 1 \\, ds = T\n$$\n$$\n\\Gamma_{T}^{12} = \\int_{0}^{T} (D_{s}X_{T})(D_{s}Y_{T}) ds = \\int_{0}^{T} 1 \\cdot (T-s) \\, ds = \\left[Ts - \\frac{s^2}{2}\\right]_{0}^{T} = T^2 - \\frac{T^2}{2} = \\frac{T^2}{2}\n$$\nBy symmetry of the inner product, $\\Gamma_{T}^{21} = \\Gamma_{T}^{12} = \\frac{T^2}{2}$.\n$$\n\\Gamma_{T}^{22} = \\int_{0}^{T} (D_{s}Y_{T})(D_{s}Y_{T}) ds = \\int_{0}^{T} (T-s)^2 ds\n$$\nUsing the substitution $u = T-s$, $du = -ds$:\n$$\n\\Gamma_{T}^{22} = \\int_{T}^{0} u^2 (-du) = \\int_{0}^{T} u^2 du = \\left[\\frac{u^3}{3}\\right]_{0}^{T} = \\frac{T^3}{3}\n$$\nThe Malliavin covariance matrix is therefore:\n$$\n\\Gamma_{T} = \\begin{pmatrix} T  \\frac{T^2}{2} \\\\ \\frac{T^2}{2}  \\frac{T^3}{3} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n**4. Hörmander's Condition**\n\nHörmander's condition states that the Lie algebra generated by the vector fields $V_0$ and $V_1$ must span the tangent space $\\mathbb{R}^2$ at every point. For this system, it is sufficient to check the span of the first few Lie brackets. We will compute $[V_1, V_0]$.\nThe Lie bracket of two vector fields $A$ and $B$ can be computed as $[A, B] = (DB)A - (DA)B$, where $DA$ and $DB$ are the Jacobian matrices.\nFrom Part 1, we have:\n$$\nV_{0}(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ x \\end{pmatrix} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad V_{1}(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nTheir Jacobians are:\n$$\nDV_{0} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad DV_{1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe Lie bracket is:\n$$\n[V_{1}, V_{0}] = (DV_{0})V_{1} - (DV_{1})V_{0} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ x \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe now check the span of $\\{V_1, [V_1, V_0]\\}$ at an arbitrary point $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$.\n$$\nV_{1}(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad [V_{1}, V_{0}](x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThese two vectors are the standard basis vectors of $\\mathbb{R}^2$. They are linearly independent and their span is $\\mathbb{R}^2$ regardless of the point $(x,y)$. Therefore, Hörmander's condition is satisfied for all points in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This implies that the law of $Z_T$ is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure, which is guaranteed by the non-degeneracy (i.e., invertibility) of the Malliavin covariance matrix $\\Gamma_T$.\n\n**Determinant of the Malliavin Covariance Matrix**\n\nThe final step is to compute the determinant of $\\Gamma_T$.\n$$\n\\det(\\Gamma_{T}) = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} T  \\frac{T^2}{2} \\\\ \\frac{T^2}{2}  \\frac{T^3}{3} \\end{pmatrix} = (T) \\left(\\frac{T^3}{3}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{T^2}{2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{T^2}{2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\det(\\Gamma_{T}) = \\frac{T^4}{3} - \\frac{T^4}{4} = \\frac{4T^4 - 3T^4}{12} = \\frac{T^4}{12}\n$$\nFor any $T0$, $\\det(\\Gamma_T)  0$, so the matrix is indeed invertible, consistent with the verification of Hörmander's condition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{T^{4}}{12}}$$", "id": "2980984"}]}
