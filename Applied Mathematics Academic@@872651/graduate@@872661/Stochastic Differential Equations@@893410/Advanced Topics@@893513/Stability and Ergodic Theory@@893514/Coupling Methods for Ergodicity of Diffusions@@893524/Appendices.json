It is a standard and fundamental exercise concerning the ergodicity of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, linking concepts of coupling, Wasserstein distance, and spectral theory.\n\nWe proceed with the derivation as requested in the three parts.\n\n**Part 1: Synchronous Coupling Contraction Rate**\n\nThe overdamped Langevin diffusion is described by the stochastic differential equation (SDE):\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}X_{t} \\;=\\; - \\nabla U(X_{t}) \\,\\mathrm{d}t \\;+\\; \\sqrt{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}B_{t}\n$$\nThe potential $U(x)$ is given as a quadratic form $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\, x^{\\top} A x$, where $A$ is a symmetric positive definite matrix. The gradient of the potential is $\\nabla U(x) = A x$.\n\nLet $X^{x}_{t}$ and $X^{y}_{t}$ be two solutions to this SDE, starting from initial conditions $X^{x}_{0}=x$ and $X^{y}_{0}=y$, respectively. They are driven by the same standard $d$-dimensional Brownian motion $B_{t}$ (synchronous coupling). The SDEs for the two processes are:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}X^{x}_{t} \\;=\\; - A X^{x}_{t} \\,\\mathrm{d}t \\;+\\; \\sqrt{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}B_{t}\n$$\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}X^{y}_{t} \\;=\\; - A X^{y}_{t} \\,\\mathrm{d}t \\;+\\; \\sqrt{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}B_{t}\n$$\nWe define the difference process $Z_{t} := X^{x}_{t}-X^{y}_{t}$. Subtracting the second SDE from the first, we obtain the evolution equation for $Z_{t}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}Z_{t} \\;=\\; \\mathrm{d}X^{x}_{t} - \\mathrm{d}X^{y}_{t} \\;=\\; (- A X^{x}_{t} \\,\\mathrm{d}t \\;+\\; \\sqrt{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}B_{t}) - (- A X^{y}_{t} \\,\\mathrm{d}t \\;+\\; \\sqrt{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}B_{t})\n$$\nThe Brownian motion terms cancel out due to the synchronous coupling.\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}Z_{t} \\;=\\; - A (X^{x}_{t} - X^{y}_{t}) \\,\\mathrm{d}t \\;=\\; - A Z_{t} \\,\\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nThis is a deterministic linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $Z_{t}$. Its solution is given by:\n$$\nZ_{t} = \\exp(-At) Z_{0} = \\exp(-At) (x-y)\n$$\nTo find the contraction rate, we analyze the evolution of the squared Euclidean norm of $Z_{t}$, which is $|Z_{t}|^{2} = Z_{t}^{\\top}Z_{t}$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t} |Z_{t}|^{2} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t} (Z_{t}^{\\top}Z_{t}) \\;=\\; (\\frac{\\mathrm{d}Z_{t}}{\\mathrm{d}t})^{\\top}Z_{t} + Z_{t}^{\\top}(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}Z_{t}}{\\mathrm{d}t})\n$$\nFrom the ODE, $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}Z_{t}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -A Z_{t}$. Since $A$ is symmetric ($A^{\\top}=A$), $(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}Z_{t}}{\\mathrm{d}t})^{\\top} = (-AZ_{t})^{\\top} = -Z_{t}^{\\top}A^{\\top} = -Z_{t}^{\\top}A$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t} |Z_{t}|^{2} \\;=\\; -Z_{t}^{\\top}A Z_{t} - Z_{t}^{\\top}A Z_{t} \\;=\\; -2 Z_{t}^{\\top}A Z_{t}\n$$\nBy the properties of the Rayleigh quotient for a symmetric matrix $A$, we know that for any non-zero vector $z \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, the value of $\\frac{z^{\\top}Az}{z^{\\top}z}$ is bounded by the smallest eigenvalue $m$ and the largest eigenvalue $L$ of $A$. Specifically, $z^{\\top}Az \\ge m |z|^{2}$.\nApplying this inequality to $Z_{t}$:\n$$\nZ_{t}^{\\top}A Z_{t} \\;\\ge\\; m |Z_{t}|^{2}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the derivative equation gives a differential inequality:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t} |Z_{t}|^{2} \\;\\le\\; -2m |Z_{t}|^{2}\n$$\nBy Grönwall's lemma, this implies:\n$$\n|Z_{t}|^{2} \\;\\le\\; |Z_{0}|^{2} \\exp(-2mt)\n$$\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n$$\n|Z_{t}| \\;\\le\\; |Z_{0}| \\exp(-mt) = |x-y| \\exp(-mt)\n$$\nThis shows that there is a uniform contraction rate of at least $m$. To show that $m$ is the largest such uniform rate, we must demonstrate that no rate $\\lambda  m$ works for all initial conditions. Let $v_{m}$ be an eigenvector of $A$ corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue $m$. Let the initial difference be $x-y = v_{m}$. Then $Z_{0} = v_{m}$. The solution for $Z_{t}$ is:\n$$\nZ_{t} = \\exp(-At) v_{m} = \\exp(-mt) v_{m}\n$$\nThe norm is then:\n$$\n|Z_{t}| = |\\exp(-mt) v_{m}| = \\exp(-mt) |v_{m}| = \\exp(-mt) |x-y|\n$$\nIn this case, the inequality $|Z_{t}| \\le \\exp(-\\lambda t) |x-y|$ becomes $\\exp(-mt) \\le \\exp(-\\lambda t)$, which is only true for all $t\\ge 0$ if $\\lambda \\le m$. Thus, $m$ is the largest possible uniform contraction rate.\nTherefore, $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{sync}} = m$.\nThis result implies a contraction for the $2$-Wasserstein distance $W_{2}$. Since the synchronous coupling is a valid coupling between the laws of $X^{x}_{t}$ and $X^{y}_{t}$, we have:\n$$\nW_{2}(P_{t}(x,\\cdot), P_{t}(y,\\cdot))^{2} \\le \\mathbb{E}[|X^{x}_{t}-X^{y}_{t}|^{2}] = |Z_{t}|^{2} \\le |x-y|^{2} \\exp(-2mt)\n$$\nwhich gives $W_{2}(P_{t}(x,\\cdot), P_{t}(y,\\cdot)) \\le |x-y| \\exp(-mt)$.\n\n**Part 2: Spectral Gap of the Generator**\n\nThe invariant measure $\\mu$ for the Langevin SDE $dX_{t} = -\\nabla U(X_t) dt + \\sqrt{2} dB_t$ has a probability density function $\\pi(x)$ proportional to the Gibbs factor $\\exp(-U(x))$. Given $U(x) = \\frac{1}{2} x^{\\top}Ax$, the invariant density is:\n$$\n\\pi(x) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2} x^{\\top}Ax\\right)\n$$\nThis is the density of a centered multivariate Gaussian distribution, $N(0, \\Sigma)$, with covariance matrix $\\Sigma = A^{-1}$. Thus, the invariant measure is $\\mu = N(0, A^{-1})$.\n\nThe spectral gap $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{gap}}$ is the optimal constant in the Poincaré inequality:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mu}(f) \\;\\le\\; \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{gap}}}\\,\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^{d}} |\\nabla f(x)|^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mu(x)\n$$\nwhere $\\mathrm{Var}_{\\mu}(f) = \\int (f - \\int f d\\mu)^{2} d\\mu$.\nA fundamental result, often associated with the Bakry-Émery criterion or directly provable for Gaussian measures, states that for a Gaussian measure $\\mu = N(0, \\Sigma)$, the optimal constant in the Poincaré inequality is the largest eigenvalue of the covariance matrix $\\Sigma$. That is, $1/\\lambda_{\\mathrm{gap}} = \\lambda_{\\max}(\\Sigma)$.\nIn our case, the covariance matrix is $\\Sigma = A^{-1}$. The eigenvalues of $A^{-1}$ are the reciprocals of the eigenvalues of $A$. Let the eigenvalues of $A$ be $0  m = \\lambda_{\\min}(A) \\le \\dots \\le \\lambda_{\\max}(A) = L$. The eigenvalues of $A^{-1}$ are $1/L \\le \\dots \\le 1/m$.\nThe largest eigenvalue of $\\Sigma=A^{-1}$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\max}(A^{-1}) = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\min}(A)} = \\frac{1}{m}\n$$\nFrom the Poincaré inequality, we have $1/\\lambda_{\\mathrm{gap}} = 1/m$, which implies $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{gap}} = m$.\n\nAlternatively, one can compute the spectrum of the generator of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, $\\mathcal{L} = -Ax \\cdot \\nabla + \\Delta$. The spectral gap is the smallest non-zero eigenvalue of $-\\mathcal{L}$. By diagonalizing $A = P D P^{\\top}$ where $D=\\mathrm{diag}(\\lambda_{1}, \\dots, \\lambda_{d})$, the SDE decouples into $d$ independent one-dimensional OU processes. The spectrum of $-\\mathcal{L}$ is the set of all sums $\\sum_{i=1}^{d} k_i \\lambda_i$ for non-negative integers $k_i$. The smallest non-zero eigenvalue corresponds to setting one $k_j=1$ and the others to $0$, which gives the set of eigenvalues $\\{\\lambda_{1}, \\dots, \\lambda_{d}\\}$. The spectral gap is the minimum of these:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\mathrm{gap}} = \\min_{i} \\{\\lambda_i\\} = m\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Comparison**\n\nFrom Part 1, we found the optimal synchronous coupling contraction rate to be $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{sync}} = m$.\nFrom Part 2, we found the spectral gap of the generator to be $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{gap}} = m$.\nThe two rates are identical. The common value is the smallest eigenvalue of the matrix $A$, which is denoted by $m$. This correspondence is a classic result for quadratic potentials, illustrating a deep connection between geometric contraction (via coupling) and functional inequalities (via spectral theory).

First, we must construct a control $\\beta_t$ to achieve a desired exponential contraction rate. Second, we must compute a corresponding upper bound on a path-space relative entropy.\n\nLet $Z_{t} = X_{t} - Y_{t}$ be the displacement process. The initial displacement is $Z_{0} = x - y$. The stochastic differential equation (SDE) for $Z_t$ is obtained by subtracting the SDE for $Y_t$ from the SDE for $X_t$:\n$$\ndZ_{t} = dX_{t} - dY_{t} = (b(X_{t}) - b(Y_{t}))\\,dt + \\sigma\\,dB_{t} - (b(Y_{t})\\,dt + \\sigma\\,dB_{t} + \\sigma\\,\\beta_{t}\\,dt)\n$$\n$$\ndZ_{t} = \\left( b(X_{t}) - b(Y_{t}) - \\sigma\\,\\beta_{t} \\right) dt\n$$\nNotice that the Brownian motion term cancels out, meaning $Z_t$ is a path-wise deterministic function for a given realization of $X_t$ and $Y_t$. Its evolution is governed by an ordinary differential equation.\n\nWe are interested in the evolution of the magnitude of the displacement, $|Z_t|$. It is more convenient to analyze its square, $|Z_t|^2$. Using the chain rule for ordinary differentials ($d|z|^2 = 2 z \\cdot dz$):\n$$\nd|Z_{t}|^2 = 2 \\langle Z_t, dZ_t \\rangle = 2 \\langle Z_t, b(X_t) - b(Y_t) - \\sigma\\,\\beta_t \\rangle dt\n$$\n$$\nd|Z_{t}|^2 = 2 \\langle X_t - Y_t, b(X_t) - b(Y_t) \\rangle dt - 2\\sigma \\langle Z_t, \\beta_t \\rangle dt\n$$\nThe problem states that the drift $b$ is one-sided dissipative with constant $m0$, which means $\\langle x-y, b(x)-b(y) \\rangle \\le -m|x-y|^2$. Applying this inequality, we get:\n$$\nd|Z_{t}|^2 \\le -2m |Z_t|^2 dt - 2\\sigma \\langle Z_t, \\beta_t \\rangle dt\n$$\nOur goal is to choose the control $\\beta_t$, which depends only on $Z_t$, to ensure that $\\mathbb{E}[|Z_t|]$ decays at a prescribed rate $\\lambda  m$.

With this choice, a more careful analysis yields $d|Z_t|^2 \\le -2\\lambda|Z_t|^2$.

Let $\\mu_y$ denote the law of the process $d\\tilde{Y}_t = b(\\tilde{Y}_t)dt + \\sigma dB_t$ with $\\tilde{Y}_0=y$.

We can write this as $dY_t = b(Y_t)dt + \\sigma(dB_t + \\beta_t dt)$. Girsanov's theorem states that if we define a new measure $\\mathbb{Q}$ under which $dW_t = dB_t + \\beta_t dt$ is a Brownian motion, then under $\\mathbb{Q}$, the process $Y_t$ satisfies $dY_t = b(Y_t)dt + \\sigma dW_t$.

The law of $X_t$, denoted by $P_t^x$, is a multivariate normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu_t(x), \\Sigma_t)$.\nThe mean vector is given by the solution to the deterministic part of the equation:\n$$ \\mu_t(x) = \\mathbb{E}[X_t | X_0=x] = \\exp(-tA)x $$\nThe covariance matrix is independent of the starting point and is given by the integral of the transformed noise covariance:\n$$ \\Sigma_t = \\text{Cov}(X_t) = \\int_0^t \\exp(-(t-s)A) (\\sqrt{2}I)(\\sqrt{2}I)^{\\top} (\\exp(-(t-s)A))^{\\top} ds $$\nSince $A$ is symmetric, $\\exp(-uA)$ is also symmetric.\n$$ \\Sigma_t = 2 \\int_0^t \\exp(-2(t-s)A) ds $$\nBy a change of variables $u = t-s$, this becomes:\n$$ \\Sigma_t = 2 \\int_0^t \\exp(-2uA) du = 2 (2A)^{-1} (I - \\exp(-2tA)) = A^{-1}(I - \\exp(-2tA)) $$\nSo, for the two processes starting at $x$ and $y$, their laws at time $t$ are $P_t^x = \\mathcal{N}(\\exp(-tA)x, \\Sigma_t)$ and $P_t^y = \\mathcal{N}(\\exp(-tA)y, \\Sigma_t)$.\n\nA fundamental result provides a lower bound for the expected coupling time $\\mathbb{E}[T]$. For any fixed time $t^*  0$:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[T] = \\int_0^\\infty \\mathbb{P}(T  t) dt \\ge t^* \\mathbb{P}(Tt^*) $$\nFurthermore, the coupling inequality states that for any co-adapted coupling, the probability of not having coupled by time $t^*$ is bounded below by the total variation distance between the marginal laws at that time:\n$$ \\mathbb{P}(T  t^*) \\ge \\|P_{t^*}^x - P_{t^*}^y\\|_{TV} $$\nCombining these gives the lower bound:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[T] \\ge t^* \\|P_{t^*}^x - P_{t^*}^y\\|_{TV} $$\nThe problem directs us to use $t^* = t_{\\kappa} = \\frac{\\ln \\kappa}{2\\lambda_{\\min}}$.\n\nThe total variation distance between two Gaussian distributions $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu_1, \\Sigma)$ and $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu_2, \\Sigma)$ with the same covariance matrix is given by:\n$$ \\|\\mathcal{N}(\\mu_1, \\Sigma) - \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_2, \\Sigma)\\|_{TV} = \\text{erf}\\left( \\frac{d}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\right) $$\nwhere $\\text{erf}(z) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\int_0^z \\exp(-u^2) du$ is the error function, and $d$ is the Mahalanobis distance between the means:\n$$ d^2 = (\\mu_1 - \\mu_2)^{\\top} \\Sigma^{-1} (\\mu_1 - \\mu_2) $$\nIn our case, at time $t$, the difference in means is $\\mu_t(x) - \\mu_t(y) = \\exp(-tA)(x-y)$. The inverse covariance matrix is $\\Sigma_t^{-1} = \\left(A^{-1}(I - \\exp(-2tA))\\right)^{-1} = (I - \\exp(-2tA))^{-1}A$.\nThe squared Mahalanobis distance $d_t^2$ is therefore:\n$$ d_t^2 = \\left(\\exp(-tA)(x-y)\\right)^{\\top} (I - \\exp(-2tA))^{-1}A \\left(\\exp(-tA)(x-y)\\right) $$\nSince $A$ is symmetric, $\\exp(-tA)$ is also symmetric.\n$$ d_t^2 = (x-y)^{\\top} \\exp(-tA) (I - \\exp(-2tA))^{-1} A \\exp(-tA) (x-y) $$\nWe are given $x-y = r_0 v_{\\min}$, where $v_{\\min}$ is an eigenvector of $A$ with eigenvalue $\\lambda_{\\min}$. We adopt the standard convention that $v_{\\min}$ is normalized to have unit Euclidean norm, i.e., $v_{\\min}^{\\top}v_{\\min}=1$. Thus, the initial separation distance is $\\|x-y\\|_2 = r_0$. Since $v_{\\min}$ is an eigenvector of $A$, it is also an eigenvector of any well-behaved function of $A$, such as $\\exp(-tA)$. Let $f(A) = \\exp(-tA) (I-\\exp(-2tA))^{-1} A \\exp(-tA)$. Then:\n$$ f(A) v_{\\min} = f(\\lambda_{\\min}) v_{\\min} $$\nThe eigenvalue $f(\\lambda_{\\min})$ is:\n$$ f(\\lambda_{\\min}) = \\exp(-t\\lambda_{\\min}) (1 - \\exp(-2t\\lambda_{\\min}))^{-1} \\lambda_{\\min} \\exp(-t\\lambda_{\\min}) = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\min} \\exp(-2t\\lambda_{\\min})}{1 - \\exp(-2t\\lambda_{\\min})} = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\min}}{\\exp(2t\\lambda_{\\min}) - 1} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $d_t^2$:\n$$ d_t^2 = (r_0 v_{\\min})^{\\top} f(A) (r_0 v_{\\min}) = r_0^2 v_{\\min}^{\\top} (f(\\lambda_{\\min}) v_{\\min}) = r_0^2 f(\\lambda_{\\min}) v_{\\min}^{\\top}v_{\\min} = r_0^2 \\frac{\\lambda_{\\min}}{\\exp(2t\\lambda_{\\min}) - 1} $$\nNow we evaluate this at the specified time $t = t_{\\kappa} = \\frac{\\ln \\kappa}{2\\lambda_{\\min}}$. The exponent becomes:\n$$ 2 t_{\\kappa} \\lambda_{\\min} = 2 \\left( \\frac{\\ln \\kappa}{2\\lambda_{\\min}} \\right) \\lambda_{\\min} = \\ln \\kappa $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $d_{t_\\kappa}^2$:\n$$ d_{t_{\\kappa}}^2 = r_0^2 \\frac{\\lambda_{\\min}}{\\exp(\\ln \\kappa) - 1} = r_0^2 \\frac{\\lambda_{\\min}}{\\kappa - 1} $$\nThe Mahalanobis distance is $d_{t_{\\kappa}} = \\sqrt{d_{t_{\\kappa}}^2} = r_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda_{\\min}}{\\kappa - 1}}$.\nThe total variation distance at time $t_\\kappa$ is:\n$$ \\|P_{t_\\kappa}^x - P_{t_\\kappa}^y\\|_{TV} = \\text{erf}\\left( \\frac{d_{t_{\\kappa}}}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\right) = \\text{erf}\\left( \\frac{r_0}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda_{\\min}}{\\kappa - 1}} \\right) = \\text{erf}\\left( r_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda_{\\min}}{8(\\kappa - 1)}} \\right) $$\nFinally, we assemble the lower bound on $\\mathbb{E}[T]$:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[T] \\ge t_{\\kappa} \\|P_{t_\\kappa}^x - P_{t_\\kappa}^y\\|_{TV} = \\frac{\\ln \\kappa}{2\\lambda_{\\min}} \\text{erf}\\left( r_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda_{\\min}}{8(\\kappa - 1)}} \\right) $$\nThis expression is the required rigorous lower bound on the expected coupling time, derived from first principles as specified.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\ln \\kappa}{2\\lambda_{\\min}} \\text{erf}\\left( r_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda_{\\min}}{8(\\kappa - 1)}} \\right)}$$", "id": "2972461"}]}
