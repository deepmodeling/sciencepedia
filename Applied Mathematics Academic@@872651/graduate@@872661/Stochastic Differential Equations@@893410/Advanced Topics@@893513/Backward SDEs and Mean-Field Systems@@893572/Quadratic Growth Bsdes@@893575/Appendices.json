It is a well-posed problem in the mathematical field of stochastic differential equations, specifically concerning backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) with quadratic growth.

This method elegantly incorporates the ideas of stochastic exponentials and martingale representations as suggested by the problem statement.\n\nLet us define a new process $V_t$ through the transformation $V_t = \\exp(\\gamma Y_t)$. We apply Itô's formula to find the dynamics of $V_t$.\nLet $f(y) = \\exp(\\gamma y)$. Then $f'(y) = \\gamma \\exp(\\gamma y)$ and $f''(y) = \\gamma^2 \\exp(\\gamma y)$.\nThus, $V_t = f(Y_t)$ and its differential is:\n$$\ndV_t = f'(Y_t) dY_t + \\frac{1}{2} f''(Y_t) d\\langle Y \\rangle_t\n$$\nSubstituting $f'(Y_t) = \\gamma V_t$ and $f''(Y_t) = \\gamma^2 V_t$:\n$$\ndV_t = \\gamma V_t dY_t + \\frac{1}{2} \\gamma^2 V_t d\\langle Y \\rangle_t\n$$\nFrom the BSDE dynamics, we have $dY_t = -\\frac{\\gamma}{2} Z_t^2 dt + Z_t dW_t$. The quadratic variation process of $Y$ is given by $d\\langle Y \\rangle_t = (Z_t)^2 dt = Z_t^2 dt$.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $dV_t$:\n$$\ndV_t = \\gamma V_t \\left(-\\frac{\\gamma}{2} Z_t^2 dt + Z_t dW_t\\right) + \\frac{1}{2} \\gamma^2 V_t (Z_t^2 dt)\n$$\n$$\ndV_t = -\\frac{\\gamma^2}{2} V_t Z_t^2 dt + \\gamma V_t Z_t dW_t + \\frac{\\gamma^2}{2} V_t Z_t^2 dt\n$$\nThe drift terms cancel out, leaving a pure stochastic integral:\n$$\ndV_t = \\gamma V_t Z_t dW_t\n$$\nThis equation shows that $V_t$ is a local martingale. Given the assumption of existence and uniqueness of the solution to the BSDE in the usual spaces (which implies certain integrability conditions), $V_t$ is a true martingale. The process $V_t$ is a specific type of stochastic exponential, a key concept hinted at in the problem.\n\nAs $V_t$ is a martingale, it satisfies the property $V_t = \\mathbb{E}[V_T|\\mathcal{F}_t]$. The terminal value $V_T$ is determined by the terminal condition $Y_T = \\xi = \\theta W_T$:\n$$\nV_T = \\exp(\\gamma Y_T) = \\exp(\\gamma \\theta W_T)\n$$\nTherefore, we can write $V_t$ as a conditional expectation:\n$$\nV_t = \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(\\gamma \\theta W_T) | \\mathcal{F}_t]\n$$\nTo evaluate this conditional expectation, we use the property that for $t \\leq T$, $W_T = W_t + (W_T - W_t)$, where the increment $(W_T - W_t)$ is independent of the filtration $\\mathcal{F}_t$ and has a normal distribution $N(0, T-t)$.\n$$\nV_t = \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(\\gamma \\theta (W_t + W_T - W_t)) | \\mathcal{F}_t]\n$$\nSince $W_t$ is $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable and $(W_T-W_t)$ is independent of $\\mathcal{F}_t$:\n$$\nV_t = \\exp(\\gamma \\theta W_t) \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(\\gamma \\theta (W_T - W_t)) | \\mathcal{F}_t] = \\exp(\\gamma \\theta W_t) \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(\\gamma \\theta (W_T - W_t))]\n$$\nThe expectation term is the moment-generating function (MGF) of a normal random variable. For a random variable $X \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$, its MGF is $\\mathbb{E}[\\exp(kX)] = \\exp(k\\mu + \\frac{1}{2}k^2\\sigma^2)$.\nHere, the random variable is $(W_T - W_t) \\sim N(0, T-t)$, so $\\mu=0$ and $\\sigma^2 = T-t$.

As $|z| \\to \\infty$, the term $\\frac{1}{2}z^2$ dominates the term $-\\lambda|z|$. More formally, we can bound the generator: $|g(t,y,z)| \\le \\frac{1}{2}z^2 + \\lambda|z| + |y|^{\\alpha}$.

This confirms that the generator has quadratic growth in $z$.\n\nTo check for convexity in $z$, we analyze the function $f(z) = \\frac{1}{2}z^2 - \\lambda|z|$.

A fundamental result in stochastic calculus states that any bounded local martingale is a true martingale. As a true martingale, $X_t$ has the property that $\\mathbb{E}[X_T|\\mathcal{F}_t] = X_t$.\n$$\n\\exp(Y_t) = \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(Y_T)|\\mathcal{F}_t]\n$$\nThis relation must hold for all $t \\in [0,T]$. Let's consider $t=0$. The filtration $\\mathcal{F}_0$ is trivial (up to $\\mathbb{P}$-null sets), so the conditional expectation becomes an unconditional expectation:\n$$\n\\exp(Y_0) = \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(Y_T)]\n$$\nSubstituting the terminal condition $Y_T = \\xi_a = a\\,W_T^2$:\n$$\n\\exp(Y_0) = \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(a\\,W_T^2)]\n$$\nFrom the boundedness assumption on $Y$, we have $|Y_0| \\le M$, which implies $\\exp(Y_0)$ is a finite positive number. Therefore, we must have:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\exp(a\\,W_T^2)]  \\infty\n$$\nThis is the necessary integrability condition that the terminal condition $\\xi_a$ must satisfy for a bounded solution to exist.\n\n**2. Calculation of the Threshold $a_c(T)$**\n\nWe now compute the expectation $\\mathbb{E}[\\exp(a\\,W_T^2)]$ and determine for which values of $a0$ it is finite. The random variable $W_T$ follows a normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $T$, i.e., $W_T \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, T)$. Its probability density function (PDF) is given by:\n$$\np(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi T}}\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2T}\\right)\n$$\nThe expectation is calculated by integrating over all possible values of $W_T$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\exp(a\\,W_T^2)] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(ax^2)\\,p(x)\\,dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(ax^2)\\,\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi T}}\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2T}\\right)\\,dx\n$$\nWe can combine the exponents:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\exp(a\\,W_T^2)] = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi T}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(ax^2 - \\frac{x^2}{2T}\\right)\\,dx = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi T}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\left(\\frac{1}{2T} - a\\right)x^2\\right)\\,dx\n$$\nThis is a standard Gaussian integral of the form $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-cx^2)\\,dx$. This integral converges if and only if the coefficient $c$ is strictly positive. In our case, $c = \\frac{1}{2T} - a$. Thus, for the expectation to be finite, we require:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2T} - a  0 \\implies a  \\frac{1}{2T}\n$$\nIf this condition holds, the value of the integral is $\\sqrt{\\pi/c}$. The expectation is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\exp(a\\,W_T^2)] = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi T}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{\\frac{1}{2T} - a}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2T}} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{1-2aT}{2T}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-2aT}}\n$$\nThis expression is finite if and only if $1-2aT  0$, i.e., $a  \\frac{1}{2T}$. If $a = \\frac{1}{2T}$, the exponent in the integrand becomes $0$, and the integral $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} 1\\,dx$ diverges. If $a  \\frac{1}{2T}$, the exponent is positive, and the integral also diverges.\n\nTherefore, the expectation $\\mathbb{E}[\\exp(a\\,W_T^2)]$ is finite if and only if $a  \\frac{1}{2T}$. The threshold value $a_c(T)$ is the supremum of the set of $a$ for which the expectation is finite. This gives:\n$$\na_c(T) = \\frac{1}{2T}\n$$\nFor any choice of $a \\ge a_c(T)$, the expectation is infinite. According to our finding in Part 1, the necessary condition for the existence of a bounded solution is violated. Thus, for any $a \\ge \\frac{1}{2T}$, no bounded solution $(Y,Z)$ to the BSDE can exist.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe analysis demonstrates the necessity of exponential integrability for the existence of bounded solutions to this quadratic BSDE.\n- Step 1 established that if a bounded solution $(Y,Z)$ exists, it is necessary for the terminal condition $\\xi_a = a\\,W_T^2$ to have a finite exponential moment, i.e., $\\mathbb{E}[\\exp(\\xi_a)]  \\infty$. This is a direct consequence of the transformation $X_t = \\exp(Y_t)$ which linearizes the BSDE's driver, converting the process into a martingale under the boundedness assumption.\n- Step 2 provided an explicit calculation of this expectation, showing $\\mathbb{E}[\\exp(a\\,W_T^2)]$ is finite if and only if $a  a_c(T) = \\frac{1}{2T}$.\n- Combining these two results, we conclude that for any parameter value $a \\ge a_c(T) = \\frac{1}{2T}$, the terminal condition $\\xi_a$ fails to be sufficiently integrable. The necessary condition derived from first principles is not met, proving that for such values of $a$, no bounded solution to the specified quadratic BSDE can exist. This highlights a fundamental feature of quadratic BSDEs: the solvability (at least for bounded solutions) is intimately linked to the exponential moments of the terminal data.\n\nThe required analytic expression for the threshold $a_c(T)$ is $\\frac{1}{2T}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2T}}\n$$", "id": "2991948"}]}
