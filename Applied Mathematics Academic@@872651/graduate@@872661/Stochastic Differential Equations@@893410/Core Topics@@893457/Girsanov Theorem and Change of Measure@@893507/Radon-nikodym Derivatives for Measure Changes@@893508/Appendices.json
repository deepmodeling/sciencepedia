First, a general explanation of why the Beneš conditions ensure that the stochastic exponential $Z_t$ is a true martingale. Second, a specific computation of $\\mathbb{E}[Z_T]$ for an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.\n\n**Part 1: The Beneš Conditions and the Martingale Property**\n\nLet $M_t = \\int_{0}^{t} \\theta_s\\,dW_s$. The process $Z_t$ is the Doléans-Dade exponential of the continuous local martingale $M_t$, given by $Z_t = \\mathcal{E}(M)_t$. It is defined as\n$$\nZ_t = \\exp\\!\\left( M_t - \\frac{1}{2} \\langle M \\rangle_t \\right) = \\exp\\!\\left( \\int_{0}^{t} \\theta_s\\,dW_s \\;-\\; \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{t} \\theta_s^{2}\\,ds \\right).\n$$\nThe conditions on $b$ and $\\sigma$ for the SDE $dX_t = b(X_t)dt + \\sigma dW_t$ ensure the existence of a unique strong solution $X_t$. The condition of linear growth on $\\phi$ implies that $\\theta_t = \\phi(X_t)$ is a well-defined process such that $\\int_0^T \\mathbb{E}[\\theta_s^2]ds  \\infty$, which is sufficient for the stochastic integral $\\int_0^t \\theta_s dW_s$ to be a martingale.\n\nBy construction (or by applying Itô's formula), the SDE for $Z_t$ is $dZ_t = Z_t \\theta_t\\,dW_t$. Since this SDE has no drift ($dt$) term, $(Z_t)_{t \\in [0,T]}$ is a local martingale. It starts at $Z_0 = \\exp(0) = 1$. Since $Z_t$ is always non-negative, it is a supermartingale, which implies $\\mathbb{E}[Z_t] \\le \\mathbb{E}[Z_0] = 1$ for all $t \\in [0,T]$.\n\nFor $(Z_t)_{t \\in [0,T]}$ to be a true martingale, its expectation must be constant. That is, we must have $\\mathbb{E}[Z_t] = 1$ for all $t \\in [0,T]$. A widely used sufficient condition for this is Novikov's condition, which states that if\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{T} \\theta_s^2\\,ds \\right) \\right]  \\infty,\n$$\nthen $(Z_t)_{t \\in [0,T]}$ is a uniformly integrable martingale, and thus a true martingale.\n\nThe Beneš conditions are a set of assumptions on the coefficients of the SDE for $X_t$ and the function $\\phi$ that are sufficient to guarantee that Novikov's condition holds. The conditions given in the problem are:\n1.  $b$ has linear growth: there exists a constant $K_1$ such that $|b(x)| \\le K_1(1+|x|)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n2.  $\\phi$ has linear growth: there exists a constant $K_2$ such that $|\\phi(x)| \\le K_2(1+|x|)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n(The Lipschitz property of $b$ and constancy of $\\sigma$ are also part of the standard setup for the Beneš criterion).\n\nThe reasoning is as follows. The linear growth of $b$ and the constant diffusion $\\sigma$ control the growth of the moments of $X_t$. It is a standard result for SDEs that these conditions imply that all moments of $X_t$ are bounded on a finite time horizon, i.e., for any $p \\ge 1$,\n$$\n\\sup_{t \\in [0,T]} \\mathbb{E}[|X_t|^p]  C_p\n$$\nfor some constant $C_p$ that depends on $p$, $T$, and the initial condition $x$.\n\nNow, we use the linear growth of $\\phi$ to bound the term in the exponent of Novikov's condition:\n$$\n\\theta_s^2 = (\\phi(X_s))^2 \\le (K_2(1+|X_s|))^2 \\le 2K_2^2(1+X_s^2).\n$$\nIntegrating over $[0,T]$ gives\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T} \\theta_s^2\\,ds \\le 2K_2^2 \\int_{0}^{T} (1+X_s^2)\\,ds = 2K_2^2 T + 2K_2^2 \\int_{0}^{T} X_s^2\\,ds.\n$$\nTherefore, to satisfy Novikov's condition, it is sufficient to show that\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\exp\\left( K_2^2 T + K_2^2 \\int_{0}^{T} X_s^2\\,ds \\right) \\right] = \\exp(K_2^2 T) \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\exp\\left( K_2^2 \\int_{0}^{T} X_s^2\\,ds \\right) \\right]  \\infty.\n$$\nThis reduces the problem to proving that $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\exp\\left(C \\int_0^T X_s^2 ds \\right)\\right]  \\infty$ for some positive constant $C$. This is the core result of the Beneš criterion. It states that for a process $X_t$ governed by an SDE with coefficients having at most linear growth, the exponential moment of the integral of $X_s^2$ is finite on any finite time interval. The proof of this fact is non-trivial and often relies on the Feynman-Kac formula to relate this expectation to the solution of a certain partial differential equation.\n\nIn summary, the Beneš conditions (linear growth on $b$ and $\\phi$) ensure the moments of $X_t$ are well-controlled, which in turn guarantees that the integral $\\int_0^T \\theta_s^2 ds$ does not grow too fast, leading to the satisfaction of Novikov's condition. This validates that $Z_t$ is a true martingale.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Case**\n\nWe are asked to compute $\\mathbb{E}[Z_T]$ for the specific case where $X_t$ is an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and $\\theta_t$ is linear in $X_t$.\nThe SDE for $X_t$ is $dX_t = -\\beta X_t\\,dt + \\sigma\\,dW_t$, with $\\beta>0$ and $\\sigma \\neq 0$.\nThe process $\\theta_t$ is given by $\\theta_t = \\lambda X_t$, with $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nFirst, we verify that the Beneš conditions, as described in Part 1, are satisfied for this specific model.\n- The drift function is $b(x) = -\\beta x$. This function is globally Lipschitz, as $|b(x) - b(y)| = |-\\beta(x-y)| = \\beta|x-y|$. It also has linear growth, since $|b(x)| = \\beta |x| \\le \\beta(1+|x|)$.\n- The function defining $\\theta_t$ is $\\phi(x) = \\lambda x$. This function also has linear growth, as $|\\phi(x)| = |\\lambda||x| \\le |\\lambda|(1+|x|)$.\n\nSince all the Beneš conditions are met, we can invoke the result explained in Part 1: the process $(Z_t)_{t \\in [0,T]}$ is a true martingale under the measure $\\mathbb{P}$.\n\nThe definition of a martingale $(M_t)_{t \\ge 0}$ states that for any $s  t$, $\\mathbb{E}[M_t | \\mathcal{F}_s] = M_s$.\nBy taking the expectation on both sides, we get $\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{E}[M_t | \\mathcal{F}_s]] = \\mathbb{E}[M_s]$. By the law of total expectation, this simplifies to $\\mathbb{E}[M_t] = \\mathbb{E}[M_s]$. This means that a martingale has a constant expectation over time.\n\nApplying this property to our true martingale $(Z_t)_{t \\in [0,T]}$, we have\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Z_T] = \\mathbb{E}[Z_0].\n$$\nWe now compute the value of $Z_0$. From the definition of $Z_t$:\n$$\nZ_t = \\exp\\!\\left( \\int_{0}^{t} \\theta_s\\,dW_s \\;-\\; \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{t} \\theta_s^{2}\\,ds \\right).\n$$\nSetting $t=0$, the integrals are over the interval $[0,0]$, which evaluates to $0$:\n$$\nZ_0 = \\exp\\!\\left( \\int_{0}^{0} \\theta_s\\,dW_s \\;-\\; \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{0} \\theta_s^{2}\\,ds \\right) = \\exp(0 - 0) = \\exp(0) = 1.\n$$\nTherefore, the expectation of $Z_T$ is\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Z_T] = \\mathbb{E}[Z_0] = \\mathbb{E}[1] = 1.\n$$\nThe value is an explicit real number, as requested. The detailed setup of the OU process and the specific parameters are used to verify the Beneš conditions, which is the crucial step that permits the simple conclusion that $\\mathbb{E}[Z_T]=1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2992589"}, {"introduction": "Once a valid change of measure from $\\mathbb{P}$ to $\\mathbb{Q}$ is established, the next step is to understand how the dynamics of processes are altered.

Let $X_t$ be a $\\mathbb{P}$-semimartingale with the canonical decomposition $X_t = X_0 + M_t^{\\mathbb{P}} + A_t^{\\mathbb{P}}$, where $M_t^{\\mathbb{P}}$ is a $\\mathbb{P}$-local martingale and $A_t^{\\mathbb{P}}$ is a predictable process of finite variation.

The covariation $[N, A]_t$ is the sum of products of jumps, $\\sum_{s \\le t} \\Delta N_s \\Delta A_s$. Since $A_t$ is continuous, $\\Delta A_s = 0$ for all $s$, so $[N, A]_t = 0$. Therefore, $[M]_t = [N]_t$.\nFor a simple counting process like $N_t$, its jumps are of size $1$ ($\\Delta N_s = 1$ if a jump occurs at time $s$).

A fundamental property of a standard Brownian motion $W$ on $[0,1]$ is that its quadratic variation, $[W,W]_1$, is almost surely equal to 1. In contrast, the zero path $x_0(t) = 0$ is smooth (specifically, of finite variation), and its quadratic variation is 0. This difference allows us to construct a set that separates the two measures.\n\nLet's define the set $S \\subset \\mathcal{C}$ as the collection of all continuous paths on $[0,1]$ whose quadratic variation over the interval is exactly 1:\n$$\nS = \\{ x \\in \\mathcal{C} \\mid [x,x]_1 = 1 \\}\n$$\nThe quadratic variation $[x,x]_1$ is a well-defined measurable function on $\\mathcal{C}$, so $S$ is a measurable set in $\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{C})$.\n\nNow let's evaluate the measure of this set under both $\\mathbb{P}$ and $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n1.  **Under the Wiener measure $\\mathbb{P}$**: By definition, $\\mathbb{P}$ is the law of a standard Brownian motion $W$. A cornerstone result of stochastic calculus is that, for a standard Brownian motion, its quadratic variation over $[0,t]$ is $t$, $\\mathbb{P}$-almost surely. Therefore, for $t=1$, we have:\n    $$\n    \\mathbb{P}(S) = \\mathbb{P}(\\{\\omega \\in \\mathcal{C} \\mid [\\omega,\\omega]_1 = 1\\}) = 1\n    $$\n2.  **Under the Dirac measure $\\mathbb{Q}$**: The measure $\\mathbb{Q}$ is defined as $\\mathbb{Q}(A) = \\delta_{x_0}(A)$, which is 1 if the zero path $x_0$ is in the set $A$, and 0 otherwise. For the path $x_0(t) = 0$, the quadratic variation is:\n    $$\n    [x_0,x_0]_1 = 0\n    $$\n    Since $[x_0,x_0]_1 = 0 \\neq 1$, the path $x_0$ is not an element of $S$.
