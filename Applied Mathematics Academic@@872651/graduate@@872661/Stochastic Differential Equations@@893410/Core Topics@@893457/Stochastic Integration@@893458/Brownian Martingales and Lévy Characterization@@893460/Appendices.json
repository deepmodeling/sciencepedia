The derivation will be based on the Lévy characterization of Brownian motion, which states that it is a continuous martingale with $B_0=0$ and quadratic variation $[B]_t = t$, and will employ Itô's formula.\n\nConsider the complex-valued process $Z_s = \\exp(i u B_s)$ for $s \\in [0, t]$. Applying Itô's formula to the function $f(x) = \\exp(i u x)$ and the process $B_s$, we have:\n$$dZ_s = f'(B_s) dB_s + \\frac{1}{2} f''(B_s) d[B]_s$$\nThe derivatives of $f(x)$ are $f'(x) = i u \\exp(i u x)$ and $f''(x) = (i u)^2 \\exp(i u x) = -u^2 \\exp(i u x)$. The quadratic variation is given as $[B]_s = s$, so $d[B]_s = ds$.\nSubstituting these into the formula yields:\n$$dZ_s = i u \\exp(i u B_s) dB_s + \\frac{1}{2} (-u^2 \\exp(i u B_s)) ds$$\n$$dZ_s = i u Z_s dB_s - \\frac{u^2}{2} Z_s ds$$\nThis is a stochastic differential equation for $Z_s$. To find its expectation, we define an auxiliary process, an exponential martingale. Let us define the process $M_s = \\exp(i u B_s + \\frac{u^2}{2} s)$. This is constructed to cancel the drift term. Let's verify this using Itô's formula for the function $g(s, x) = \\exp(i u x + \\frac{u^2}{2} s)$ and the process $B_s$.\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial s} = \\frac{u^2}{2} g(s, x)$, $\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} = i u g(s, x)$, and $\\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial x^2} = -u^2 g(s, x)$.\nApplying Itô's formula for time-dependent functions:\n$$dM_s = \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial s}(s, B_s) ds + \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}(s, B_s) dB_s + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial x^2}(s, B_s) d[B]_s$$\n$$dM_s = \\left(\\frac{u^2}{2} M_s\\right) ds + (i u M_s) dB_s + \\frac{1}{2} (-u^2 M_s) ds$$\n$$dM_s = \\left(\\frac{u^2}{2} - \\frac{u^2}{2}\\right) M_s ds + i u M_s dB_s = i u M_s dB_s$$\nThe drift term (the $ds$ term) is zero, which confirms that $M_s$ is a continuous local martingale. It is a standard result that for a Brownian motion, this exponential local martingale is in fact a true martingale.\nAs $M_s$ is a martingale, we have the property $\\mathbb{E}[M_t] = \\mathbb{E}[M_0]$.\nWe evaluate $M_0$:\n$$M_0 = \\exp(i u B_0 + \\frac{u^2}{2} \\cdot 0) = \\exp(0) = 1$$\nsince $B_0=0$ by definition of standard Brownian motion.\nTherefore, $\\mathbb{E}[M_t] = 1$. Let's write out $M_t$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\exp\\left(i u B_t + \\frac{u^2}{2} t\\right)\\right] = 1$$\n$$\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\exp(i u B_t) \\exp\\left(\\frac{u^2}{2} t\\right)\\right] = 1$$\nThe term $\\exp(\\frac{u^2}{2} t)$ is deterministic and can be factored out of the expectation:\n$$\\exp\\left(\\frac{u^2}{2} t\\right) \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(i u B_t)] = 1$$\nThe expectation term is the definition of the characteristic function $\\varphi_{B_t}(u)$.\n$$\\exp\\left(\\frac{u^2}{2} t\\right) \\varphi_{B_t}(u) = 1$$\nSolving for $\\varphi_{B_t}(u)$, we obtain the closed-form expression:\n$$\\varphi_{B_t}(u) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{u^2 t}{2}\\right)$$\n\nSecond, we deduce the distribution of $B_t$ from its characteristic function. A random variable $X$ follows a Gaussian (normal) distribution with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2$, denoted $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$, if and only if its characteristic function has the form $\\varphi_X(u) = \\exp(i u \\mu - \\frac{u^2 \\sigma^2}{2})$.\nBy comparing our derived characteristic function $\\varphi_{B_t}(u) = \\exp(-\\frac{u^2 t}{2})$ with the general form, we can identify the parameters by inspection:\nThe coefficient of the $i u$ term in the exponent is $0$, so the mean is $\\mu = 0$.\nThe coefficient of the $-u^2/2$ term in the exponent is $t$, so the variance is $\\sigma^2 = t$.\nThus, we conclude that $B_t$ is a Gaussian random variable with mean $0$ and variance $t$, i.e., $B_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, t)$.\n\nThird, as a consistency check, we justify the reflection principle. We need to show that for $a  0$, $\\mathbb{P}(\\sup_{0 \\leq s \\leq t} B_s \\geq a) = 2 \\mathbb{P}(B_t \\geq a)$.\nLet $M_t = \\sup_{0 \\leq s \\leq t} B_s$. Let $\\tau_a = \\inf\\{s \\geq 0: B_s = a\\}$ be the first time the process hits the level $a$. Since $B_s$ has continuous paths and $B_0=0  a$, the event $\\{M_t \\geq a\\}$ is identical to the event $\\{\\tau_a \\leq t\\}$.\nWe can partition this event based on the value of $B_t$:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(M_t \\geq a) = \\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\leq t) = \\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\leq t, B_t  a) + \\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\leq t, B_t  a) + \\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\leq t, B_t = a)$$\nSince $B_t$ has a continuous distribution, $\\mathbb{P}(B_t = a) = 0$, so the third term is zero.\nIf $B_t  a$, then by the continuity of paths, the process must have crossed the level $a$ at some time at or before $t$. Therefore, the event $\\{B_t  a\\}$ is a subset of the event $\\{\\tau_a \\leq t\\}$. This simplifies the first term:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\leq t, B_t  a) = \\mathbb{P}(B_t  a)$$\nFor the second term, we apply the strong Markov property at the stopping time $\\tau_a$. On the event $\\{\\tau_a \\leq t\\}$, the process $s \\mapsto B_{s+\\tau_a} - B_{\\tau_a} = B_{s+\\tau_a} - a$ is a Brownian motion starting from $0$ and is independent of the pre-$\\tau_a$ sigma-algebra $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_a}$. By symmetry of Brownian motion, conditional on $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_a}$, the probability of being above or below the starting point at a later time is equal. Specifically, for the increment $B_t - B_{\\tau_a}$, we have $\\mathbb{P}(B_t - B_{\\tau_a}  0 | \\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_a}) = \\mathbb{P}(B_t - B_{\\tau_a}  0 | \\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_a}) = 1/2$.\nApplying this, we find:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\leq t, B_t  a) = \\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\leq t, B_t - B_{\\tau_a}  0) = \\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\leq t, B_t - B_{\\tau_a}  0) = \\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\leq t, B_t  a)$$\nThe middle equality holds by applying the law of total probability and the strong Markov property: $\\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{I}_{\\{\\tau_a \\leq t\\}}\\mathbb{P}(B_t-B_{\\tau_a}0|\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_a})] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{I}_{\\{\\tau_a \\leq t\\}} \\frac{1}{2}] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{I}_{\\{\\tau_a \\leq t\\}}\\mathbb{P}(B_t-B_{\\tau_a}0|\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_a})]$.\nSo, we have shown $\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a \\leq t, B_t  a) = \\mathbb{P}(B_t  a)$.\nSubstituting back:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(M_t \\geq a) = \\mathbb{P}(B_t  a) + \\mathbb{P}(B_t  a) = 2 \\mathbb{P}(B_t  a)$$\nSince $\\mathbb{P}(B_t = a) = 0$, we have $\\mathbb{P}(B_t  a) = \\mathbb{P}(B_t \\geq a)$, which completes the justification.\n\nFinally, we express the tail probability in terms of the standard normal CDF, $\\Phi(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{x} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp(-y^2/2) dy$.\nWe have $B_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, t)$. The standardized variable $Z = B_t/\\sqrt{t}$ follows a standard normal distribution, $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$.\n$$\\mathbb{P}(B_t \\geq a) = \\mathbb{P}\\left(\\frac{B_t}{\\sqrt{t}} \\geq \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{t}}\\right) = \\mathbb{P}\\left(Z \\geq \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{t}}\\right)$$\nThis tail probability is given by $1 - \\mathbb{P}(Z  a/\\sqrt{t}) = 1 - \\Phi(a/\\sqrt{t})$.\nTherefore, the probability of the supremum is:\n$$\\mathbb{P}\\left(\\sup_{0 \\leq s \\leq t} B_s \\geq a\\right) = 2 \\mathbb{P}(B_t \\geq a) = 2\\left(1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{t}}\\right)\\right)$$\n\nThe problem requires the single closed-form expression for $\\varphi_{B_{t}}(u)$ as the final answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{u^{2} t}{2}\\right)}$$", "id": "2993856"}, {"introduction": "Building on the martingale properties of Brownian motion, we can now explore one of the most powerful tools in stochastic analysis: the Girsanov theorem for changing probability measures.

The questions are precise and lead to a unique, meaningful result.\n-   **Objective:** The language is purely mathematical and devoid of any subjectivity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\n### Part 1: Solution of the Stochastic Differential Equation\n\nWe are given the SDE:\n$$dZ_t = Z_t\\,\\dot{h}(t)\\,dW_t, \\quad Z_0=1$$\nThis is a linear SDE. Since $Z_t$ is expected to be positive (as it starts at $1$ and is driven by an exponential-like dynamic), we can solve it by considering the process $Y_t = \\ln(Z_t)$. We apply Itô's lemma for the function $f(z) = \\ln(z)$, which has derivatives $f'(z) = 1/z$ and $f''(z) = -1/z^2$. The Itô differential for $Y_t$ is:\n$$dY_t = d(\\ln Z_t) = f'(Z_t)dZ_t + \\frac{1}{2}f''(Z_t)d\\langle Z \\rangle_t$$\nThe quadratic variation of $Z_t$ is given by $d\\langle Z \\rangle_t = (Z_t \\dot{h}(t))^2 dt = Z_t^2 \\dot{h}(t)^2 dt$. Substituting this and the SDE for $dZ_t$ into the expression for $dY_t$:\n$$dY_t = \\frac{1}{Z_t}(Z_t \\dot{h}(t) dW_t) + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(-\\frac{1}{Z_t^2}\\right)(Z_t^2 \\dot{h}(t)^2 dt)$$\n$$dY_t = \\dot{h}(t) dW_t - \\frac{1}{2}\\dot{h}(t)^2 dt$$\nTo find $Y_t$, we integrate from $0$ to $t$:\n$$Y_t - Y_0 = \\int_0^t \\dot{h}(s) dW_s - \\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^t \\dot{h}(s)^2 ds$$\nGiven $Z_0=1$, we have $Y_0 = \\ln(Z_0) = \\ln(1) = 0$. Therefore:\n$$Y_t = \\int_0^t \\dot{h}(s) dW_s - \\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^t \\dot{h}(s)^2 ds$$\nSince $Z_t = \\exp(Y_t)$, the unique strong solution is:\n$$Z_t = \\exp\\left( \\int_0^t \\dot{h}(s) dW_s - \\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^t \\dot{h}(s)^2 ds \\right)$$\nThis process is known as the Doléans-Dade exponential or stochastic exponential of the process $\\int \\dot{h} dW$, often denoted as $\\mathcal{E}\\left(\\int \\dot{h} dW\\right)_t$.\n\n### Part 2: Martingale Property and Expectation of $Z_t$\n\nLet $M_t = \\int_0^t \\dot{h}(s) dW_s$. Since $\\dot{h}$ is a deterministic function and $\\dot{h} \\in L^2([0,T])$, the stochastic integral $M_t$ defines a continuous, centered Gaussian process. It is a true martingale (in fact, an $L^2$-martingale), not just a local one. Its quadratic variation is, by the properties of the Itô integral:\n$$\\langle M \\rangle_t = \\left\\langle \\int_0^\\cdot \\dot{h}(s) dW_s \\right\\rangle_t = \\int_0^t \\dot{h}(s)^2 ds$$\nThe process $Z_t$ can be written as $Z_t = \\exp(M_t - \\frac{1}{2}\\langle M \\rangle_t)$. A fundamental result states that the stochastic exponential of a continuous local martingale is a continuous local martingale. Thus, $(Z_t)_{t \\in [0,T]}$ is a continuous local martingale.\n\nTo prove that it is a true martingale, we must show that $\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{P}}[Z_t] = \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{P}}[Z_0]=1$ for all $t \\in [0,T]$. A sufficient condition for a positive local martingale to be a true martingale is Novikov's condition, which states that if $\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{P}}\\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\langle M \\rangle_T\\right)\\right]  \\infty$, then $Z_t = \\mathcal{E}(M)_t$ is a martingale.\n\nIn our case, the quadratic variation at time $T$ is:\n$$\\langle M \\rangle_T = \\int_0^T \\dot{h}(s)^2 ds$$\nSince $h \\in H$, we are given that $\\dot{h} \\in L^2([0,T])$, which means the integral $\\int_0^T \\dot{h}(s)^2 ds$ is a finite real number. As $\\dot{h}$ is deterministic, this integral is a deterministic constant. Let this constant be $C = \\int_0^T \\dot{h}(s)^2 ds  \\infty$.\nNow we check Novikov's condition:\n$$\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{P}}\\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\langle M \\rangle_T\\right)\\right] = \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{P}}\\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2}C\\right)\\right]$$\nSince the expression inside the expectation is a deterministic constant, its expectation is simply its own value:\n$$\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{P}}\\left[\\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2}C\\right)\\right] = \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2}C\\right)$$\nwhich is a finite number. Thus, Novikov's condition is satisfied.\nThis proves that $(Z_t)_{t \\in [0,T]}$ is a true martingale under the measure $\\mathbb{P}$.\n\nFor any martingale, the expectation is constant over time. Therefore, for any $t \\in [0,T]$:\n$$\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{P}}[Z_t] = \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{P}}[Z_0]$$\nAs $Z_0=1$ is given, we have:\n$$\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{P}}[Z_T] = 1$$\n\n### Part 3: Change of Measure and Identification of Laws\n\nWe define a new probability measure $\\mathbb{Q}$ on $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}_T)$ via the Radon-Nikodym derivative $\\frac{d\\mathbb{Q}}{d\\mathbb{P}} = Z_T$. Since $Z_T  0$ almost surely and we have just shown $\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{P}}[Z_T]=1$, $\\mathbb{Q}$ is a valid probability measure equivalent to $\\mathbb{P}$.\n\nOur goal is to show that the process $\\widetilde{W}_t := W_t - h(t)$ is a standard Brownian motion under $\\mathbb{Q}$. We use the Lévy characterization of Brownian motion, which requires us to show that $(\\widetilde{W}_t)_{t \\in [0,T]}$ is a continuous $\\mathbb{Q}$-local martingale with quadratic variation $\\langle \\widetilde{W} \\rangle_t = t$.\n\n1.  **Continuity**: $W_t$ is a Brownian motion, hence its paths are almost surely continuous. The function $h(t)$ is absolutely continuous, which implies it is continuous. The difference of two continuous functions is continuous, so $\\widetilde{W}_t$ has almost surely continuous paths.\n\n2.  **Quadratic Variation**: The quadratic variation of a semimartingale is a property of its paths and does not change under an equivalent change of measure. The process $h(t)$ is deterministic and has finite variation (since it is absolutely continuous), which implies its quadratic variation is zero. Therefore:\n    $$\\langle \\widetilde{W} \\rangle_t = \\langle W - h \\rangle_t = \\langle W \\rangle_t = t$$\n    The cross-variation term $\\langle W, h \\rangle_t$ is zero because $h$ has finite variation.\n\n3.  **Martingale Property under $\\mathbb{Q}$**: We invoke the general form of Girsanov's theorem. It states that if $X_t$ is a $\\mathbb{P}$-local martingale, then the process $X_t - \\langle X, \\ln Z \\rangle_t$ is a $\\mathbb{Q}$-local martingale. Let us apply this to $X_t = W_t$, which is a $\\mathbb{P}$-martingale. The resulting $\\mathbb{Q}$-local martingale is $W_t - \\langle W, \\ln Z \\rangle_t$.\n    We need to compute the cross-variation $\\langle W, \\ln Z \\rangle_t$. From Part 1, we have the differential for $\\ln Z_t$:\n    $$d(\\ln Z_t) = \\dot{h}(t) dW_t - \\frac{1}{2}\\dot{h}(t)^2 dt$$\n    The differential of the cross-variation is given by the product of the diffusion coefficients with respect to $W$:\n    $$d\\langle W, \\ln Z \\rangle_t = 1 \\cdot \\dot{h}(t) dt = \\dot{h}(t) dt$$\n    Integrating from $0$ to $t$ gives:\n    $$\\langle W, \\ln Z \\rangle_t = \\int_0^t \\dot{h}(s) ds$$\n    Since $h$ is absolutely continuous and $h(0)=0$, we have $h(t) = \\int_0^t \\dot{h}(s) ds$.\n    Therefore, the $\\mathbb{Q}$-local martingale guaranteed by Girsanov's theorem is:\n    $$W_t - \\langle W, \\ln Z \\rangle_t = W_t - h(t) = \\widetilde{W}_t$$\n    This proves that $(\\widetilde{W}_t)_{t \\in [0,T]}$ is a continuous $\\mathbb{Q}$-local martingale.\n\nCombining these three points, $(\\widetilde{W}_t)_{t \\in [0,T]}$ is a continuous $\\mathbb{Q}$-local martingale with quadratic variation $\\langle \\widetilde{W} \\rangle_t=t$. By the Lévy characterization, $\\widetilde{W}$ is a standard Brownian motion under the measure $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nFinally, we must show that $\\frac{d\\mathbb{P}_h}{d\\mathbb{P}}\\big|_{\\mathcal{F}_T}=Z_T$. This is equivalent to showing that the measure $\\mathbb{Q}$ is the same as the measure $\\mathbb{P}_h$ (interpreted as a measure on $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}_T)$).\nUnder the measure $\\mathbb{Q}$, the canonical process $W$ can be expressed as $W_t = \\widetilde{W}_t + h(t)$, where $\\widetilde{W}$ is a standard $\\mathbb{Q}$-Brownian motion. The law of the process $(W_t)_{t \\in [0,T]}$ under $\\mathbb{Q}$ is therefore the law of a standard Brownian motion plus the deterministic shift $h$.\nBy definition, the measure $\\mathbb{P}_h$ is precisely the law of the process $(W_t+h(t))_{t \\in [0,T]}$ where $W$ is a standard Brownian motion under $\\mathbb{P}$.\nThus, the law of $W$ under $\\mathbb{Q}$ is identical to the law $\\mathbb{P}_h$.\nThis implies that for any event $A \\in \\mathcal{F}_T$, $\\mathbb{Q}(A) = \\mathbb{P}_h(A)$.\nSince we defined $\\mathbb{Q}$ through its Radon-Nikodym derivative with respect to $\\mathbb{P}$ as $Z_T$, it follows that:\n$$\\frac{d\\mathbb{P}_h}{d\\mathbb{P}}\\bigg|_{\\mathcal{F}_T} = \\frac{d\\mathbb{Q}}{d\\mathbb{P}}\\bigg|_{\\mathcal{F}_T} = Z_T$$\nThis concludes the proof.

It concerns the properties of a time-changed continuous local martingale, a central topic in stochastic calculus covered by the Dambis-Dubins-Schwarz (DDS) theorem. All definitions and statements are standard and mathematically precise.\n\nThe core of the problem is to understand why the process $(B_s)_{s\\ge 0}$, which is a standard Brownian motion with respect to the time-changed filtration $(\\mathcal{F}_{T_s})_{s\\ge 0}$, does not, in general, retain this property when viewed with respect to the original filtration $(\\mathcal{F}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ (indexed by the new time parameter $s$). A process being a Brownian motion with respect to a given filtration $(\\mathcal{G}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ requires several properties, most notably that it is adapted to $(\\mathcal{G}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ and that its increments are independent of the past, i.e., for $rs$, the increment $B_s-B_r$ is independent of the $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{G}_r$.\n\nThe fundamental reason for the properties to fail with respect to $(\\mathcal{F}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ is the mismatch between the filtrations $(\\mathcal{F}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ and $(\\mathcal{F}_{T_s})_{s\\ge 0}$. The time $T_s = \\inf\\{t\\ge 0: \\langle M \\rangle_t  s\\}$ is a random variable that depends on the path of the quadratic variation process $\\langle M \\rangle_t$. In general, $T_s$ is not equal to the deterministic time $s$. This means that the information available at time $s$ in the original filtration, $\\mathcal{F}_s$, is generally different from the information available at the random time $T_s$, which is contained in $\\mathcal{F}_{T_s}$.\n\nA process $(X_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ is adapted to a filtration $(\\mathcal{G}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ if for every $s\\ge 0$, the random variable $X_s$ is $\\mathcal{G}_s$-measurable. For our process $B_s = M_{T_s}$ to be adapted to $(\\mathcal{F}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$, $M_{T_s}$ must be $\\mathcal{F}_s$-measurable for all $s$. The value of $M_{T_s}$ depends on the path of $M$ up to the random time $T_s$. If it is possible for $T_s  s$, then $M_{T_s}$ depends on information from the future with respect to time $s$, and thus cannot be $\\mathcal{F}_s$-measurable. Therefore, for $(B_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ to be adapted to $(\\mathcal{F}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$, we must have $T_s \\leq s$ almost surely for all $s\\ge 0$. From the definition of $T_s$, the condition $T_s \\le s$ is equivalent to $\\langle M \\rangle_s \\ge s$.\n\nWe will now evaluate each option based on this framework.\n\n**A. In general, $(B_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ does not have independent increments with respect to $(\\mathcal{F}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$, because the $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{F}_s$ can strictly contain $\\mathcal{F}_{T_s}$ on events where $T_ss$, thereby including information about the path of $(M_t)_{t\\ge 0}$ over $(T_s,s]$, which can couple with the future increment $M_{T_u}-M_{T_s}=B_u-B_s$ for $us$. Independence of increments for $(B_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ is guaranteed only relative to $(\\mathcal{F}_{T_s})_{s\\ge 0}$.**\n\nThis statement is correct. It precisely identifies the source of the problem. While the comparison of $\\sigma$-algebras \"on events\" is informal, the intuition is sound. Formally, for $r  s$, the increment $B_s - B_r = M_{T_s} - M_{T_r}$ is independent of $\\mathcal{F}_{T_r}$. However, it is not generally independent of $\\mathcal{F}_r$. When the underlying volatility of $M$ is stochastic, the path of $M_t$ up to time $r$ (information in $\\mathcal{F}_r$) provides information about the likely path of $\\langle M \\rangle_t$. This information influences the random times $T_s$ and $T_r$, which define the increment. For instance, if $\\langle M \\rangle_r  r$, then $T_r  r$. The knowledge of the path of $M_t$ on the interval $(T_r, r]$, which is contained in $\\mathcal{F}_r$ but not in $\\mathcal{F}_{T_r}$, can be correlated with the future behavior of $\\langle M \\rangle_t$ and thus with the value of the future increment $B_s - B_r$. The statement that independence is guaranteed with respect to $(\\mathcal{F}_{T_s})_{s\\ge 0}$ is the essence of the DDS theorem.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Independence of increments of $(B_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ with respect to $(\\mathcal{F}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ holds if and only if $\\langle M\\rangle_t=t$ almost surely, in which case $T_s=s$ almost surely and $B_s=M_s$ is a standard Brownian motion relative to $(\\mathcal{F}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ by the Lévy characterization.**\n\nThis statement is correct. It establishes the unique condition under which the time-changed process behaves as a Brownian motion with respect to the original filtration.\n- **If part ($\\Leftarrow$)**: If $\\langle M \\rangle_t = t$ a.s. for all $t\\ge 0$, then $T_s = \\inf\\{t\\ge 0 : t  s\\} = s$ a.s. In this case, $B_s = M_{T_s} = M_s$. The process $(B_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ is simply the original process $(M_s)_{s\\ge 0}$. Since $(M_t)_{t\\ge 0}$ is given as a continuous local martingale with $M_0=0$ and $\\langle M \\rangle_t=t$, by the Lévy characterization, it is a standard Brownian motion with respect to its own filtration, $(\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\\ge 0}$. Thus, it has independent increments with respect to $(\\mathcal{F}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$.\n- **Only if part ($\\Rightarrow$)**: For $(B_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ to have independent increments with respect to $(\\mathcal{F}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ (and to be considered a Brownian motion), it must first be adapted to $(\\mathcal{F}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$. As established earlier, this requires $T_s \\le s$ a.s. for all $s$, which is equivalent to $\\langle M \\rangle_s \\ge s$ a.s. for all $s$. Now consider the independence property itself. For the increment $B_u-B_s = M_{T_u}-M_{T_s}$ to be independent of $\\mathcal{F}_s$ for $us$, any information in $\\mathcal{F}_s$ must be decorrelated from it. However, if $\\langle M \\rangle_s  s$ on a set of positive probability, then on this set $T_s  s$. The information in $\\mathcal{F}_s$ about the path of $M_t$ on $(T_s, s]$ will generally be correlated with the subsequent evolution of $\\langle M \\rangle_t$ and hence with the times $T_s, T_u$ and the increment $M_{T_u}-M_{T_s}$. For this coupling to be severed for a general continuous local martingale $M$, the time-change must be trivial. This requires that the condition for adaptedness, $\\langle M \\rangle_s \\ge s$, must be met with equality, i.e., $\\langle M \\rangle_s = s$ a.s. for all $s$.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. The optional stopping theorem for $(M_t)_{t\\ge 0}$ at stopping times $T_sT_u$ implies that $M_{T_u}-M_{T_s}$ is independent of $\\mathcal{F}_{T_s}$, which in turn implies independence of $B_u-B_s$ from $\\mathcal{F}_s$; hence independence cannot fail under $(\\mathcal{F}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect on multiple grounds. First, the optional stopping theorem (or more accurately, the strong Markov property of $M$) implies that $\\mathbb{E}[M_{T_u}-M_{T_s} | \\mathcal{F}_{T_s}] = 0$ (under suitable integrability conditions for $M$, or by localization), not that the increment is independent of $\\mathcal{F}_{T_s}$. The independence is a stronger property that follows from the full DDS theorem. Second, and more critically, even if one grants independence from $\\mathcal{F}_{T_s}$, this does not imply independence from $\\mathcal{F}_s$. As argued in A, $\\mathcal{F}_s$ and $\\mathcal{F}_{T_s}$ are generally different filtrations, and independence with respect to one does not imply independence with respect to the other.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. If one replaces $(\\mathcal{F}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ by the completed natural filtration $(\\sigma(B_r:0\\le r\\le s))_{s\\ge 0}$ of $(B_s)_{s\\ge 0}$, the independence of increments is restored; the failure occurs only when one insists on the original filtration $(\\mathcal{F}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ rather than the appropriate $(\\mathcal{F}_{T_s})_{s\\ge 0}$ or the natural filtration of $(B_s)_{s\\ge 0}$.**\n\nThis statement is correct. The DDS theorem states that the process $(B_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ *is* a standard Brownian motion. A key part of the definition of a standard Brownian motion is that it has stationary and independent increments. When this is stated without reference to a specific filtration, it is understood to hold with respect to its own natural filtration $(\\mathcal{B}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ where $\\mathcal{B}_s = \\sigma(B_r:0\\le r\\le s)$. The DDS theorem gives a larger filtration, $(\\mathcal{F}_{T_s})_{s\\ge 0}$, with respect to which $(B_s)_{s \\ge 0}$ is a Brownian motion. Since $(\\mathcal{B}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ is a sub-filtration of $(\\mathcal{F}_{T_s})_{s\\ge 0}$, the property also holds for the natural filtration. The statement correctly identifies that the \"failure\" of properties is not intrinsic to the process $(B_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ but is relative to the choice of the filtration $(\\mathcal{F}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. If $\\langle M\\rangle_t=a(t)$ is a deterministic, strictly increasing function with $a(t)\\neq t$, then $T_s=a^{-1}(s)$ is deterministic, so viewing $(B_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ under $(\\mathcal{F}_s)_{s\\ge 0}$ still leads to failure of independence of increments, without exception.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect because it is too strong and mischaracterizes one of the failure modes. Let $M_t = \\int_0^t \\sqrt{a'(u)} dW_u$ for a standard Brownian motion $W$. Then $\\langle M \\rangle_t = a(t)$.\nThe increment is $B_u - B_s = M_{a^{-1}(u)} - M_{a^{-1}(s)} = \\int_{a^{-1}(s)}^{a^{-1}(u)} \\sqrt{a'(v)} dW_v$.\nThis increment is independent of $\\mathcal{F}_s = \\sigma (W_v : v\\le s)$ if and only if the integration interval $[a^{-1}(s), a^{-1}(u)]$ has no overlap with $[0,s]$, which means $a^{-1}(s) \\ge s$, or equivalently $s \\ge a(s)$.\nConsider the case where $a(t) \\neq t$.\n1. If there exists some $s_0$ such that $a(s_0)  s_0$, then $a^{-1}(s_0)  s_0$. In this case, the process is adapted at $s_0$, but for $us_0$ sufficiently close to $s_0$, the integration interval $[a^{-1}(s_0), a^{-1}(u)]$ overlaps with $[0, s_0]$. Thus, independence of increments fails.\n2. If $a(t)  t$ for all $t0$. For example, let $a(t)=t/2$. Then $a^{-1}(s)=2s$. The condition for independence, $a^{-1}(s) \\ge s$, becomes $2s \\ge s$, which is true for all $s\\ge 0$. So, in this case, the increments *are* independent of $\\mathcal{F}_s$. However, the process $(B_s)_{s\\ge0}$ is not an $(\\mathcal{F}_s)$-Brownian motion because it is not adapted: $T_s = 2s  s$.\nSince the statement claims independence fails \"without exception\" if $a(t)\\neq t$, and we have found a case where it does not fail (but adaptedness does), the statement is false.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABD}$$", "id": "3000830"}]}
