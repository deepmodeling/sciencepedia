I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for a multi-step analysis of a transformed stochastic process. Let $X = (X_t)_{t \\ge 0}$ be the process governed by the stochastic differential equation (SDE):\n$$dX_{t} = \\mu X_{t} \\, dt + \\sigma X_{t} \\, dW_{t}, \\quad X_{0} = x_{0}  0$$\nwhere $\\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $\\sigma  0$ are constants, and $W = (W_t)_{t \\ge 0}$ is a standard one-dimensional Brownian motion. We define a new process $Z_t = s(X_t)$, where $s: (0, \\infty) \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a twice continuously differentiable ($C^2$) and strictly increasing function.\n\n**1. Derivation of the SDE for $Z_t$**\n\nTo find the SDE for $Z_t = s(X_t)$, we apply Itô's formula for the function $s$ and the process $X$. The given Itô's formula is\n$$df(Y_{t}) = f'(Y_{t})\\,dY_{t} + \\tfrac{1}{2} f''(Y_{t})\\,\\varsigma(Y_{t})^{2} \\, dt$$\nfor a process $Y_t$ with SDE $dY_t = \\beta(Y_t) dt + \\varsigma(Y_t) dW_t$.\nFor our case, $f=s$, $Y_t = X_t$, the drift coefficient is $\\beta(x) = \\mu x$, and the diffusion coefficient is $\\varsigma(x) = \\sigma x$.\nApplying the formula, we have:\n$$dZ_t = ds(X_t) = s'(X_t) dX_t + \\frac{1}{2} s''(X_t) (\\sigma X_t)^2 dt$$\nSubstituting the expression for $dX_t$:\n$$dZ_t = s'(X_t) (\\mu X_t dt + \\sigma X_t dW_t) + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 X_t^2 s''(X_t) dt$$\nGrouping the $dt$ and $dW_t$ terms, we obtain the SDE for $Z_t$:\n$$dZ_t = \\left( \\mu X_t s'(X_t) + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 X_t^2 s''(X_t) \\right) dt + \\left( \\sigma X_t s'(X_t) \\right) dW_t$$\nThe drift coefficient of $Z_t$ is $\\mu X_t s'(X_t) + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 X_t^2 s''(X_t)$, and the diffusion coefficient is $\\sigma X_t s'(X_t)$. Note that the drift term, as a function of $x=X_t$, is precisely the action of the infinitesimal generator $L$ on the function $s$, i.e., $(Ls)(X_t)$.\n\n**2. ODE for Zero Drift**\n\nThe process $Z_t$ has zero drift if its drift coefficient is identically zero. This condition translates to the following ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the function $s(x)$:\n$$\\mu x s'(x) + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 x^2 s''(x) = 0, \\quad \\text{for } x  0$$\nThis is the condition that $s$ is a scale function for the diffusion $X$, commonly written as $Ls = 0$.\n\n**3. Solution of the ODE and the Diffusion Coefficient of $Z$**\n\nWe solve the ODE derived in the previous step. Let $v(x) = s'(x)$. The ODE becomes a first-order linear ODE for $v(x)$:\n$$\\mu x v(x) + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 x^2 v'(x) = 0$$\nSince $x  0$, we can divide by $x$. For $v(x) \\neq 0$, we can rearrange it into a separable form:\n$$\\frac{v'(x)}{v(x)} = -\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2 x}$$\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $x$:\n$$\\int \\frac{v'(x)}{v(x)} dx = \\int -\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2 x} dx$$\n$$\\ln|v(x)| = -\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2} \\ln|x| + C_0$$\nSince $x  0$ and $s$ is strictly increasing, we have $v(x) = s'(x)  0$. Thus, $|x|=x$ and $|v(x)|=v(x)$.\n$$\\ln(v(x)) = \\ln\\left(x^{-2\\mu/\\sigma^2}\\right) + C_0$$\nExponentiating both sides gives:\n$$v(x) = \\exp(C_0) x^{-2\\mu/\\sigma^2} = C_1 x^{-2\\mu/\\sigma^2}$$\nwhere $C_1 = \\exp(C_0)$ is an arbitrary positive constant.\nSo, $s'(x) = C_1 x^{-2\\mu/\\sigma^2}$. To find $s(x)$, we integrate $s'(x)$. This yields $s(x) = C_1 \\int x^{-2\\mu/\\sigma^2} dx + C_2$. The explicit form of $s(x)$ depends on whether the exponent is $-1$, but we only need $s'(x)$ for the next step.\n\nThe diffusion coefficient of $Z_t$, as a function of the state $x=X_t$, is $\\sigma x s'(x)$. Substituting the expression for $s'(x)$:\n$$\\text{Diffusion coeff. of } Z = \\sigma x \\left(C_1 x^{-2\\mu/\\sigma^2}\\right) = C_1 \\sigma x^{1 - 2\\mu/\\sigma^2}$$\n\n**4. Constant Diffusion and Normalization**\n\nFor the diffusion coefficient of $Z$ to be tractable in the sense of being constant (independent of $x$), the exponent of $x$ in the expression $C_1 \\sigma x^{1 - 2\\mu/\\sigma^2}$ must be zero.\n$$1 - \\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2} = 0 \\implies 2\\mu = \\sigma^2 \\implies \\mu = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2}$$\nThis is the condition on the drift parameter $\\mu$. Under this condition, the diffusion coefficient becomes a constant:\n$$\\text{Diffusion coeff. of } Z = C_1 \\sigma x^{0} = C_1 \\sigma$$\nThe problem asks to choose the normalization of $s$ so that this constant equals $1$. The normalization of $s$ is controlled by the constant $C_1$. We set:\n$$C_1 \\sigma = 1 \\implies C_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sigma}$$\nWith this choice of $C_1$, the diffusion coefficient is exactly $1$.\n\n**Justification for Order Preservation**\n\nThe pathwise comparison principle for one-dimensional SDEs states that if we have two solutions $Y_t^{(1)}$ and $Y_t^{(2)}$ to the same SDE $dY_t = \\beta(Y_t) dt + \\varsigma(Y_t) dW_t$ with initial conditions $Y_0^{(1)} \\le Y_0^{(2)}$, then $Y_t^{(1)} \\le Y_t^{(2)}$ for all $t \\ge 0$ almost surely, provided the coefficients $\\beta$ and $\\varsigma$ are regular enough (e.g., locally Lipschitz) to ensure pathwise uniqueness of solutions.\n\nLet $s$ be the scale function satisfying $Ls=0$. The transformed process $Z_t = s(X_t)$ satisfies the driftless SDE $dZ_t = \\sigma_Z(Z_t)dW_t$, where the diffusion coefficient is $\\sigma_Z(z) = \\sigma g(z) s'(g(z))$ with $g = s^{-1}$. This diffusion coefficient is continuously differentiable because $s$ is $C^2$ and strictly increasing, thus ensuring the local Lipschitz condition is met.\n\nConsider two solutions of the original SDE, $X_t^{x_0}$ and $X_t^{y_0}$, with initial conditions $x_0 \\le y_0$. Let the corresponding transformed processes be $Z_t^{(1)} = s(X_t^{x_0})$ and $Z_t^{(2)} = s(X_t^{y_0})$. Both $Z_t^{(1)}$ and $Z_t^{(2)}$ satisfy the same driftless SDE. Their initial conditions are $Z_0^{(1)} = s(x_0)$ and $Z_0^{(2)} = s(y_0)$. Since $s$ is strictly increasing, the condition $x_0 \\le y_0$ implies $s(x_0) \\le s(y_0)$, so $Z_0^{(1)} \\le Z_0^{(2)}$.\n\nBy the pathwise comparison principle applied to the SDE for $Z$, the ordering of the initial conditions is preserved for all time. Therefore, $Z_t^{(1)} \\le Z_t^{(2)}$ for all $t \\ge 0$ almost surely. This is equivalent to $s(X^{x_0}_{t}) \\le s(X^{y_{0}}_{t})$ almost surely for all $t \\ge 0$. Thus, the transformation by a strictly increasing function $s$ preserves the order of solutions. In the specific case found in part 4, the SDE for $Z_t$ is simply $dZ_t = dW_t$, for which the comparison principle trivially holds.\n\nThe final answer requested is the value of the normalized diffusion coefficient in the constant-diffusion case. As derived in step 4, this value is $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2970999"}, {"introduction": "A core tenet of comparison principles is that a process with a systematically larger drift should, on average, attain higher values.

If $b$ and $\\sigma$ are continuously differentiable with bounded derivatives, globally Lipschitz, nondecreasing, with at least one of $b$ or $\\sigma$ strictly increasing on every interval, and the diffusion is uniformly nondegenerate in the sense that $\\inf_{x\\in\\mathbb{R}}\\sigma(x)0$, then for every fixed $t0$ and $xy$ one has $\\mathbb{P}\\!\\left(X_t^xX_t^y\\right)=1$.**\n\nThe condition that $b$ and $\\sigma$ are continuously differentiable with bounded derivatives ($C_b^1$) is very strong. It guarantees that the stochastic flow map $\\varphi_t(x) = X_t^x$ is differentiable with respect to the initial condition $x$. Let $Y_t(x) = \\frac{\\partial X_t^x}{\\partial x}$. This derivative process satisfies the linear SDE:\n$$\ndY_t(x) = b'\\!\\left(X_t^x\\right) Y_t(x)\\,dt + \\sigma'\\!\\left(X_t^x\\right) Y_t(x)\\,dW_t, \\qquad Y_0(x) = 1.\n$$\nThe solution to this linear SDE is given by:\n$$\nY_t(x) = \\exp\\left(\\int_0^t \\left(b'\\!\\left(X_s^x\\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\sigma'\\!\\left(X_s^x\\right)\\right)^2\\right)ds + \\int_0^t \\sigma'\\!\\left(X_s^x\\right)dW_s\\right).\n$$\nSince the exponential function is always strictly positive, $Y_t(x)  0$ a.s. for all $t \\ge 0$ and all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nFor $x  y$, we can write the difference $X_t^y - X_t^x$ using the fundamental theorem of calculus:\n$$\nX_t^y - X_t^x = \\varphi_t(y) - \\varphi_t(x) = \\int_x^y \\frac{\\partial\\varphi_t(z)}{\\partial z} dz = \\int_x^y Y_t(z) dz.\n$$\nSince $Y_t(z)  0$ a.s. for each $z$, and this holds for all $z \\in [x, y]$, the integral over the interval $[x, y]$ of length $y-x  0$ must be strictly positive a.s.\nTherefore, $X_t^y - X_t^x  0$ a.s., which implies $\\mathbb{P}(X_t^x  X_t^y) = 1$.\n\nThe other conditions mentioned in the statement ($b, \\sigma$ nondecreasing, one strictly increasing, $\\inf \\sigma(x)  0$) are also sufficient conditions or contribute to ensuring the setup is sound, but the $C_b^1$ property of the coefficients is the key to this direct proof. Specifically, the uniform non-degeneracy of $\\sigma$ is another powerful condition that ensures strict comparison through other arguments (e.g., via Hörmander's theorem implying the transition density is positive everywhere), but the differentiability of the flow provides a more straightforward path. The statement provides a set of sufficient conditions.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Strict monotonicity may fail in the presence of degeneracy: there exist globally Lipschitz, nondecreasing coefficients with $\\sigma$ vanishing at an equilibrium point $x_0$ where $b(x_0)=0$ such that, for some $t0$ and $xy$, one has $\\mathbb{P}\\!\\left(X_t^x=X_t^y\\right)0$.**\n\nThis statement claims that strict monotonicity can fail if the diffusion coefficient $\\sigma$ vanishes. We can verify this by constructing a suitable example.\nLet $x_0 = 0$. We need coefficients $b$ and $\\sigma$ that are globally Lipschitz, nondecreasing, and satisfy $b(0) = 0$ and $\\sigma(0)=0$.\nConsider the SDE:\n$$\ndX_t = \\tanh(X_t) dt + \\tanh(X_t) dW_t.\n$$\nHere, $b(x) = \\tanh(x)$ and $\\sigma(x) = \\tanh(x)$.\n1.  **Global Lipschitz:** The derivative is $\\text{sech}^2(x)$, which is bounded by $1$. So, both functions are globally Lipschitz.\n2.  **Nondecreasing:** The derivative $\\text{sech}^2(x)  0$, so both functions are strictly increasing, hence nondecreasing.\n3.  **Equilibrium and Degeneracy:** At $x_0=0$, we have $b(0) = \\tanh(0) = 0$ and $\\sigma(0) = \\tanh(0) = 0$. So $0$ is an equilibrium point where the diffusion degenerates.\n\nNow we analyze the behavior of solutions. A crucial result for one-dimensional diffusions is Feller's test for boundary behavior. For an SDE with coefficients behaving like $b(x) \\approx \\alpha x$ and $\\sigma(x) \\approx \\beta x$ for $x \\to 0$, the boundary at $0$ is attractive (reachable in finite time a.s. from any starting point) if $2\\alpha/\\beta^2 \\ge 1$.\nFor our choice, near $x=0$, $\\tanh(x) \\approx x$. So we can identify $\\alpha = 1$ and $\\beta = 1$. The condition becomes $2(1)/(1)^2 = 2 \\ge 1$, which is satisfied.\nThis means that any solution starting from $x  0$ will reach $0$ in finite time a.s. By symmetry, any solution starting from $y  0$ will also reach $0$ in finite time a.s.\n\nLet's choose initial conditions $x  0  y$. Let $X_t^x$ and $X_t^y$ be the corresponding solutions.\nLet $\\tau_x = \\inf\\{t0 : X_t^x = 0\\}$ and $\\tau_y = \\inf\\{t0 : X_t^y = 0\\}$. From Feller's test, we know that $\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_x  \\infty) = 1$ and $\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_y  \\infty) = 1$.\nLet $\\tau = \\max(\\tau_x, \\tau_y)$. Then $\\tau$ is also finite a.s.\nSince $0$ is an equilibrium point ($b(0)=0, \\sigma(0)=0$), if a path reaches $0$, it stays there forever (by pathwise uniqueness, as $X_t \\equiv 0$ is a solution). Thus, for any $t \\ge \\tau_x$, $X_t^x = 0$, and for any $t \\ge \\tau_y$, $X_t^y = 0$.\nFor any time $t \\ge \\tau = \\max(\\tau_x, \\tau_y)$, we have $X_t^x = 0$ and $X_t^y = 0$, so $X_t^x = X_t^y$.\nFor any fixed $t0$, the event $\\{X_t^x = X_t^y\\}$ contains the event $\\{\\tau \\le t\\}$. Since $\\tau$ is an a.s. finite random variable, $\\mathbb{P}(\\tau \\le t)  0$.\nTherefore, $\\mathbb{P}(X_t^x=X_t^y)  0$ for any $t0$ and for the chosen $x0y$. This demonstrates that strict monotonicity fails.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. If the diffusion coefficient is constant and strictly positive, $\\sigma(x)\\equiv c0$, and the drift $b$ is nondecreasing and globally Lipschitz, then for each fixed $t0$ and $xy$ one has $\\mathbb{P}\\!\\left(X_t^xX_t^y\\right)=1$.**\n\nLet $xy$ and consider the corresponding solutions $X_t^x$ and $X_t^y$. Define the difference process $Z_t = X_t^y - X_t^x$. The initial condition is $Z_0 = y-x  0$. The SDE for $Z_t$ is:\n$$\ndZ_t = dX_t^y - dX_t^x = \\left[b(X_t^y) - b(X_t^x)\\right]dt + \\left[\\sigma(X_t^y) - \\sigma(X_t^x)\\right]dW_t.\n$$\nUnder the conditions of this option, $\\sigma(x) \\equiv c$, so $\\sigma(X_t^y) - \\sigma(X_t^x) = c - c = 0$. The SDE for $Z_t$ simplifies to a pathwise ordinary differential equation:\n$$\ndZ_t = \\left[b(X_t^y) - b(X_t^x)\\right]dt.\n$$\nIntegrating from $0$ to $t$ gives:\n$$\nZ_t = Z_0 + \\int_0^t \\left[b(X_s^y) - b(X_s^x)\\right]ds.\n$$\nFrom the problem's global assumptions, the non-strict comparison principle holds, so $X_s^x \\le X_s^y$ a.s.\nSince the drift $b$ is nondecreasing, $u \\le v \\implies b(u) \\le b(v)$. Applying this to the states of our solutions, we get $b(X_s^x) \\le b(X_s^y)$.\nThis means the integrand $b(X_s^y) - b(X_s^x)$ is non-negative for all $s \\ge 0$ a.s.\nThe integral of a non-negative function is non-negative. Thus, $\\int_0^t [b(X_s^y) - b(X_s^x)]ds \\ge 0$.\nSo, we have:\n$$\nZ_t \\ge Z_0 = y-x.\n$$\nSince $y-x  0$, we have $Z_t  0$ a.s. for all $t \\ge 0$. This means $X_t^y - X_t^x  0$ a.s., which is strict monotonicity.\n\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Even if $b$ and $\\sigma$ are merely nondecreasing and globally Lipschitz and $\\sigma$ may vanish at some points, strict monotonicity still follows from pathwise uniqueness; that is, for every fixed $t0$ and $xy$ one necessarily has $\\mathbb{P}\\!\\left(X_t^xX_t^y\\right)=1$.**\n\nThis statement claims that pathwise uniqueness combined with nondecreasing, Lipschitz coefficients is sufficient to guarantee strict monotonicity, even when $\\sigma$ may vanish.\nThis claim is directly contradicted by our analysis of option B. In that analysis, we constructed a counterexample with coefficients $b(x)=\\tanh(x)$ and $\\sigma(x)=\\tanh(x)$. These coefficients are nondecreasing and globally Lipschitz, so pathwise uniqueness holds. Furthermore, $\\sigma(x)$ vanishes at $x=0$. We showed explicitly that for these coefficients, strict monotonicity fails; specifically, for $x0y$, we have $\\mathbb{P}(X_t^x=X_t^y)0$.\nPathwise uniqueness ensures that if two solution paths meet, they must coincide thereafter. It does not, by itself, prevent the paths from meeting in the first place. The possibility of meeting is precisely what can lead to the failure of strict monotonicity, and this possibility is often realized at points where the diffusion coefficient degenerates (i.e., $\\sigma(x)=0$).\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABC}$$", "id": "2970983"}]}
