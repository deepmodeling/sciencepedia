Assume $\\tilde{S}_n > 0$. For $\\tilde{S}_{n+1}$ to become negative or zero, the factor $(1 + \\mu \\Delta t + \\sigma \\Delta W_n)$ must be less than or equal to zero.\nThis event occurs if $\\sigma \\Delta W_n \\le -(1 + \\mu \\Delta t)$.\nThe random variable $\\Delta W_n$ follows a Gaussian distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, \\Delta t)$. The support of a Gaussian distribution is the entire real line $(-\\infty, \\infty)$. Therefore, for any chosen $\\Delta t > 0$ and any finite threshold, there is a non-zero probability that $\\Delta W_n$ will cross it. Specifically, $P(\\sigma \\Delta W_n \\le -(1 + \\mu \\Delta t)) > 0$.\nThus, the scheme can produce negative values, even if the true solution $S_t = S_0 \\exp((\\mu - \\sigma^2/2)t + \\sigma W_t)$ is always positive. The scheme does not preserve positivity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**F. If, instead of the frozen–integrand scheme, one applies the Milstein scheme to the same GBM SDE, the strong convergence order improves to $1$.**\nFor a general SDE $dX_t = a(X_t) dt + b(X_t) dW_t$, the Milstein scheme is given by:\n$$\n\\tilde{X}_{n+1} = \\tilde{X}_n + a(\\tilde{X}_n)\\Delta t + b(\\tilde{X}_n) \\Delta W_n + \\frac{1}{2} b(\\tilde{X}_n) b'(\\tilde{X}_n) ((\\Delta W_n)^2 - \\Delta t)\n$$\nFor the GBM SDE, we have $a(S) = \\mu S$ and $b(S) = \\sigma S$. The derivative of the diffusion coefficient is $b'(S) = \\sigma$.\nSubstituting these into the Milstein formula:\n$$\n\\tilde{S}_{n+1} = \\tilde{S}_n + \\mu \\tilde{S}_n \\Delta t + \\sigma \\tilde{S}_n \\Delta W_n + \\frac{1}{2} (\\sigma \\tilde{S}_n) (\\sigma) ((\\Delta W_n)^2 - \\Delta t)\n$$\nThe general theory of numerical SDEs states that the Milstein scheme achieves a strong convergence order of $\\gamma=1.0$ (and a mean-square order of $\\beta=2.0$), provided the coefficients satisfy certain smoothness and growth conditions. The coefficients of the GBM SDE fit within a class of SDEs (linear SDEs) for which this higher order is achieved. This represents an improvement from the strong order of $\\gamma=1/2$ of the Euler-Maruyama scheme.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACEF}$$", "id": "3001449"}]}
