Although the diffusion term is zero, which simplifies the SDE to an ordinary differential equation (ODE), the framework and concepts (stopping times, explosion time) are central to SDE theory. The drift function $b(x) = x^{1+\\alpha}$ is a standard example of a coefficient with superlinear growth.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary information. The functions, parameters, and initial conditions are clearly defined. The tasks are specific and lead to a unique, computable solution.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, formal mathematical language, devoid of any subjectivity or ambiguity.\n- **Conclusion:** The problem is self-contained, consistent, and scientifically sound. It is a valid problem in mathematics.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with a full solution.\n\n**Solution**\n\n**Part 1: Pathwise Existence and Uniqueness**\n\nThe given SDE is $dX_{t} = b(X_{t}) dt$, with a drift coefficient $b(x) = x^{1+\\alpha}$ and a diffusion coefficient $\\sigma(x)=0$. The initial condition is $X_{0} = x_{0} > 0$.\n\nThe fundamental theorem for existence and uniqueness of solutions to SDEs requires the coefficients to be locally Lipschitz. Let's verify this condition.\nThe diffusion coefficient $\\sigma(x) = 0$ is a constant function, which is globally Lipschitz.\nThe drift coefficient is $b(x) = x^{1+\\alpha}$. Since the initial condition is $x_{0} > 0$ and the drift $b(x) = x^{1+\\alpha}$ is positive for all $x>0$, the solution $X_{t}$ will remain positive for all time $t$ before a potential explosion. We can therefore restrict our analysis to the domain $(0, \\infty)$.\nThe function $b(x)$ is continuously differentiable on $(0, \\infty)$, with derivative $b'(x) = (1+\\alpha)x^{\\alpha}$. For any compact interval $[c, d] \\subset (0, \\infty)$, the derivative $b'(x)$ is continuous and therefore bounded. By the Mean Value Theorem, for any $x, y \\in [c, d]$, there exists a constant $L_K$ (where $K=[c,d]$) such that $|b(x) - b(y)| \\le L_K |x-y|$. Thus, $b(x)$ is locally Lipschitz on $(0, \\infty)$.\n\nSince both the drift and diffusion coefficients are locally Lipschitz, the general existence and uniqueness theorem for SDEs guarantees that there exists a unique, pathwise solution $(X_{t})_{t \\in [0, \\zeta)}$ defined up to a stopping time $\\zeta$, which is the explosion time. The explosion time $\\zeta$ is defined as $\\zeta = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\theta_{n}$, where $\\theta_{n} = \\inf\\{t \\ge 0 : |X_{t}| \\ge n \\}$.\nThe standard condition for global existence (existence for all $t\\ge 0$) is that the coefficients satisfy a linear growth condition: $|b(x)| + |\\sigma(x)| \\le C(1+|x|)$ for some constant $C$. Here, $|b(x)| = x^{1+\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha > 0$, so $1+\\alpha > 1$. This function grows faster than linearly, violating the linear growth condition. This violation suggests that the solution may explode in finite time, i.e., $\\zeta  \\infty$.\n\n**Part 2: Computation of the Explosion Time $\\zeta$**\n\nAs the diffusion term is zero, the SDE simplifies to an autonomous ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$\n\\frac{dX_{t}}{dt} = X_{t}^{1+\\alpha}\n$$\nThis ODE is separable. For $X_t > 0$, we can write:\n$$\nX_{t}^{-(1+\\alpha)} dX_{t} = dt\n$$\nWe integrate both sides from the initial time $t=0$ to a later time $t$, and correspondingly from the initial state $X_{0}=x_{0}$ to $X_{t}$:\n$$\n\\int_{x_0}^{X_t} x^{-(1+\\alpha)} dx = \\int_0^t ds\n$$\nEvaluating the integral on the left-hand side:\n$$\n\\left[ \\frac{x^{-\\alpha}}{-\\alpha} \\right]_{x_0}^{X_t} = t\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{X_t^{-\\alpha}}{-\\alpha} - \\frac{x_0^{-\\alpha}}{-\\alpha} = t\n$$\n$$\nt = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\left( x_0^{-\\alpha} - X_t^{-\\alpha} \\right)\n$$\nThe explosion time $\\zeta$ is the time $t$ at which $X_{t} \\to \\infty$. As $X_{t} \\to \\infty$, since $\\alpha>0$, the term $X_{t}^{-\\alpha} \\to 0$. Taking this limit in the expression for $t$:\n$$\n\\zeta = \\lim_{X_t \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\left( x_0^{-\\alpha} - X_t^{-\\alpha} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} x_0^{-\\alpha}\n$$\nSince $x_{0}>0$ and $\\alpha>0$, $\\zeta$ is a finite positive number. This confirms that the solution explodes in finite time.\n\n**Part 3: Computation of $\\tau_{n}$ and the Leading-Order Term of $\\zeta - \\tau_{n}$**\n\nThe stopping time $\\tau_{n}$ is defined as the first time $t$ at which the process $X_{t}$ reaches the value $n$. We can compute this time using the relationship between $t$ and $X_{t}$ derived above. Setting $t = \\tau_{n}$ and $X_{\\tau_n} = n$ (for $n > x_{0}$):\n$$\n\\tau_{n} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\left( x_0^{-\\alpha} - n^{-\\alpha} \\right)\n$$\nWe are asked to find the leading-order term of the difference $\\zeta - \\tau_{n}$ as $n \\to \\infty$. We compute this difference directly:\n$$\n\\zeta - \\tau_{n} = \\left( \\frac{1}{\\alpha} x_0^{-\\alpha} \\right) - \\left( \\frac{1}{\\alpha} (x_0^{-\\alpha} - n^{-\\alpha}) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\zeta - \\tau_{n} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} x_0^{-\\alpha} - \\frac{1}{\\alpha} x_0^{-\\alpha} + \\frac{1}{\\alpha} n^{-\\alpha}\n$$\n$$\n\\zeta - \\tau_{n} = \\frac{n^{-\\alpha}}{\\alpha}\n$$\nThis expression is the exact difference for any $n > x_0$. As $n \\to \\infty$, this term describes the rate at which $\\tau_n$ approaches $\\zeta$. An asymptotic expansion of $\\zeta - \\tau_n$ in terms of $n$ would consist of only this single term. Therefore, this expression is itself the exact leading-order term.\nThe result can also be written as $\\frac{1}{\\alpha n^{\\alpha}}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{n^{-\\alpha}}{\\alpha}}$$", "id": "2985414"}, {"introduction": "At the heart of constructing local solutions is the stopping time itself, with the first hitting time being a fundamental example.

No rounding is required. No physical units are involved.", "solution": "The problem is well-posed and represents a fundamental result in the theory of stochastic processes. We proceed with the two required tasks.\n\n### Part 1: Proof that $\\tau_{a}$ is a stopping time\n\nLet $\\{W_{t}\\}_{t \\geq 0}$ be a standard one-dimensional Brownian motion starting from $W_{0} = 0$, and let $\\{\\mathcal{F}_{t}\\}_{t \\geq 0}$ be the natural filtration generated by $\\{W_{t}\\}_{t \\geq 0}$. Let $a  0$ be a fixed level. The first hitting time of this level is defined as $\\tau_{a} := \\inf\\{t \\geq 0: W_{t} = a\\}$.\n\nBy definition, a random variable $T: \\Omega \\to [0, \\infty]$ is a stopping time with respect to the filtration $\\{\\mathcal{F}_{t}\\}_{t \\geq 0}$ if for every fixed $t \\geq 0$, the event $\\{T \\leq t\\}$ is an element of the sigma-algebra $\\mathcal{F}_{t}$. We must show that the event $\\{\\tau_{a} \\leq t\\}$ belongs to $\\mathcal{F}_{t}$ for any $t \\geq 0$.\n\nThe event $\\{\\tau_{a} \\leq t\\}$ signifies that the Brownian path has reached or exceeded the level $a$ at some time $s$ in the interval $[0, t]$. A defining property of standard Brownian motion is that its sample paths are continuous almost surely. Due to this path continuity and the fact that $W_{0}=0  a$, the event $\\{\\tau_{a} \\leq t\\}$ is equivalent to the event that the supremum of the process over the interval $[0, t]$ is at least $a$.\n$$\n\\{\\tau_{a} \\leq t\\} = \\{\\sup_{0 \\leq s \\leq t} W_{s} \\geq a\\}\n$$\nTo show that this event belongs to $\\mathcal{F}_{t}$, we leverage the continuity of the paths again. The supremum over the uncountable set of times $s \\in [0, t]$ is equal to the supremum over the countable set of rational times in the same interval, i.e., $s \\in [0, t] \\cap \\mathbb{Q}$.\n$$\n\\{\\sup_{0 \\leq s \\leq t} W_{s} \\geq a\\} = \\{\\sup_{s \\in [0, t] \\cap \\mathbb{Q}} W_{s} \\geq a\\}\n$$\nThe event that the supremum of a set of random variables is greater than or equal to $a$ can be expressed as follows: for any $\\epsilon  0$, there must be a point in the set whose value is greater than $a - \\epsilon$. We can express this using a countable sequence of $\\epsilon$ values, for instance, $\\epsilon_n = 1/n$ for $n \\in \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$.\n$$\n\\{\\sup_{s \\in [0, t] \\cap \\mathbb{Q}} W_{s} \\geq a\\} = \\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\bigcup_{s \\in [0, t] \\cap \\mathbb{Q}} \\{W_{s}  a - \\frac{1}{n}\\}\n$$\nNow we analyze the measurability of the events on the right-hand side.\nFor any fixed rational time $s \\in [0, t]$, the random variable $W_{s}$ is, by definition, $\\mathcal{F}_{s}$-measurable. Since the filtration is non-decreasing ($\\mathcal{F}_{s} \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}_{t}$ for $s \\leq t$), $W_{s}$ is also $\\mathcal{F}_{t}$-measurable. Consequently, the event $\\{W_{s}  a - 1/n\\}$ is in $\\mathcal{F}_{t}$.\n\nThe set of rational numbers in the interval $[0, t]$, denoted by $[0, t] \\cap \\mathbb{Q}$, is a countable set. Therefore, the union $\\bigcup_{s \\in [0, t] \\cap \\mathbb{Q}} \\{W_{s}  a - 1/n\\}$ is a countable union of events in $\\mathcal{F}_{t}$. Since a sigma-algebra is closed under countable unions, this union is an event in $\\mathcal{F}_{t}$.\n\nFinally, the event in question, $\\bigcap_{n=1}^{\\infty} (\\dots)$, is a countable intersection of events that we have just shown to be in $\\mathcal{F}_{t}$. As a sigma-algebra is also closed under countable intersections, the entire expression represents an event in $\\mathcal{F}_{t}$.\n\nThus, we have demonstrated that for any $t \\geq 0$, the event $\\{\\tau_{a} \\leq t\\}$ is in $\\mathcal{F}_{t}$. This proves that $\\tau_{a}$ is a stopping time with respect to the natural filtration $\\{\\mathcal{F}_{t}\\}_{t \\geq 0}$.\n\n### Part 2: Derivation of the CDF and PDF of $\\tau_{a}$\n\nWe wish to find the cumulative distribution function (CDF) $F_{\\tau_{a}}(t) = \\mathbb{P}(\\tau_{a} \\leq t)$ for $t  0$. As established in Part 1, this is equivalent to finding $\\mathbb{P}(\\sup_{0 \\leq s \\leq t} W_{s} \\geq a)$.\n\nWe can partition this event based on the value of the process at time $t$, $W_{t}$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(\\sup_{0 \\leq s \\leq t} W_{s} \\geq a) = \\mathbb{P}(\\sup_{0 \\leq s \\leq t} W_{s} \\geq a, W_{t} \\geq a) + \\mathbb{P}(\\sup_{0 \\leq s \\leq t} W_{s} \\geq a, W_{t}  a)\n$$\nConsider the first term. If $W_{t} \\geq a$, then it is certain that the supremum of the process over $[0, t]$ is also at least $a$. Therefore, the event $\\{\\sup_{0 \\leq s \\leq t} W_{s} \\geq a, W_{t} \\geq a\\}$ is identical to the event $\\{W_{t} \\geq a\\}$. The first term simplifies to $\\mathbb{P}(W_{t} \\geq a)$.\n\nNow we use the reflection principle to evaluate the second term, $\\mathbb{P}(\\sup_{0 \\leq s \\leq t} W_{s} \\geq a, W_{t}  a)$. The reflection principle is a consequence of the strong Markov property of Brownian motion. Consider a path $\\omega$ for which $\\tau_{a}(\\omega) \\leq t$ and $W_{t}(\\omega)  a$. We can define a new, reflected path $\\tilde{W}_{s}$ by reflecting the original path about the line $y=a$ after the first hitting time $\\tau_{a}$:\n$$\n\\tilde{W}_{s}(\\omega) = \n\\begin{cases} \nW_{s}(\\omega)  \\text{if } s \\leq \\tau_{a}(\\omega) \\\\\n2a - W_{s}(\\omega)  \\text{if } s  \\tau_{a}(\\omega)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe process $Y_{u} = W_{\\tau_{a}+u} - W_{\\tau_{a}}$ for $u \\geq 0$ is, by the strong Markov property, a standard Brownian motion independent of $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_{a}}$. The process $-Y_{u}$ is also a standard Brownian motion. The reflected process after time $\\tau_a$ is $2a - W_s = a - (W_s - a) = a - Y_{s-\\tau_a}$. The law of the entire process $\\{\\tilde{W}_{s}\\}_{s \\geq 0}$ is the same as the law of the original Brownian motion $\\{W_{s}\\}_{s \\geq 0}$.\n\nFor our path $\\omega$ in the event $\\{\\sup_{0 \\leq s \\leq t} W_{s} \\geq a, W_{t}  a\\}$, we have $\\tau_{a} \\le t$ and $W_{t}  a$. The corresponding reflected path $\\tilde{\\omega}$ has a value at time $t$ of $\\tilde{W}_{t} = 2a - W_{t}$. Since $W_{t}  a$, it follows that $\\tilde{W}_{t}  2a - a = a$. So, $\\tilde{W}_{t}  a$.\nConversely, if a path is in the event $\\{W_{t}  a\\}$, then by continuity it must have crossed the level $a$ at some time $\\tau_{a}  t$. Reflecting this path gives a new path $\\tilde{W}$ with $\\tilde{W}_{t} = 2a - W_{t}  a$.\nThis establishes a measure-preserving bijection between the set of paths $\\{\\sup_{0 \\leq s \\leq t} W_{s} \\geq a, W_{t}  a\\}$ and the set of paths $\\{W_{t}  a\\}$. Therefore, their probabilities are equal:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}(\\sup_{0 \\leq s \\leq t} W_{s} \\geq a, W_{t}  a) = \\mathbb{P}(W_{t}  a)\n$$\nSubstituting this back into our partitioned probability expression:\n$$\nF_{\\tau_{a}}(t) = \\mathbb{P}(\\tau_{a} \\leq t) = \\mathbb{P}(W_{t} \\geq a) + \\mathbb{P}(W_{t}  a)\n$$\nA standard Brownian motion $W_{t}$ has a normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, t)$, which is a continuous distribution. Therefore, the probability of it taking any specific value is zero, i.e., $\\mathbb{P}(W_{t} = a) = 0$. This implies $\\mathbb{P}(W_{t} \\geq a) = \\mathbb{P}(W_{t}  a)$.\nThe CDF becomes:\n$$\nF_{\\tau_{a}}(t) = 2 \\mathbb{P}(W_{t}  a)\n$$\nTo evaluate this probability, we standardize the random variable $W_{t}$. Let $Z = W_{t}/\\sqrt{t}$, where $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ is a standard normal random variable.\n$$\nF_{\\tau_{a}}(t) = 2 \\mathbb{P}\\left(\\frac{W_{t}}{\\sqrt{t}}  \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{t}}\\right) = 2 \\mathbb{P}\\left(Z  \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{t}}\\right)\n$$\nThe CDF can be written as an integral of the standard normal probability density function:\n$$\nF_{\\tau_{a}}(t) = 2 \\int_{a/\\sqrt{t}}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z^{2}}{2}\\right) dz\n$$\nTo find the probability density function (PDF) $f_{\\tau_{a}}(t)$, we differentiate the CDF with respect to $t$.

We may proceed with the solution.\n\nPart 1: Calculation of $\\mathbb{E}[X_{\\tau_{a}}]$\n\nThe process $X_{t}$ is a standard one-dimensional Brownian motion starting at $X_0 = 0$. A fundamental property of one-dimensional Brownian motion is that it is recurrent, meaning it will eventually visit any point on the real line. For any level $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the first passage time $\\tau_a$ is finite with probability $1$. That is, $\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_{a}  \\infty) = 1$.\n\nThe stopping time $\\tau_{a}$ is defined as the first time the process $X_t$ reaches the level $a$. By the definition of an infimum and the continuity of the paths of Brownian motion, at the moment $\\tau_{a}$, the value of the process must be $a$, provided $\\tau_a  \\infty$.\nSince $\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_a  \\infty)=1$, we have $X_{\\tau_{a}} = a$ almost surely.\n\nThe expectation $\\mathbb{E}[X_{\\tau_{a}}]$ is the expectation of an almost surely constant random variable.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X_{\\tau_{a}}] = \\mathbb{E}[a] = a\n$$\nSince $a  0$ was given, we have $\\mathbb{E}[X_{\\tau_{a}}] = a  0$.\n\nPart 2: Analysis of the Optional Stopping Theorem\n\nThe Optional Stopping Theorem (OST) provides conditions under which the identity $\\mathbb{E}[X_{\\tau}] = \\mathbb{E}[X_0]$ holds for a martingale $(X_t)_{t\\ge 0}$ and a stopping time $\\tau$. In our case, $X_t = W_t$ is a martingale with $\\mathbb{E}[X_0] = \\mathbb{E}[0] = 0$. We have just calculated $\\mathbb{E}[X_{\\tau_{a}}] = a$. Since $a  0$, it is clear that $\\mathbb{E}[X_{\\tau_{a}}] \\neq \\mathbb{E}[X_0]$. This means that the conditions of the OST are not met for the martingale $X_t$ and the stopping time $\\tau_a$. The task is to identify precisely which hypothesis is violated.\n\nLet us consider the stopped process $(M_t)_{t \\ge 0}$ defined by $M_t := X_{t \\wedge \\tau_{a}}$.\nFor any continuous local martingale $(X_t)_{t \\ge 0}$ and any stopping time $\\tau$, the stopped process $(X_{t \\wedge \\tau})_{t \\ge 0}$ is also a continuous local martingale. In our case, $X_t$ is a true martingale. A standard result states that stopping a martingale yields a martingale. Therefore, $(M_t)_{t \\ge 0}$ is a martingale.\nAs a consequence, for any $t \\ge 0$, we must have:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[M_t] = \\mathbb{E}[M_0]\n$$\nSince $M_0 = X_{0 \\wedge \\tau_{a}} = X_0 = 0$, it follows that for all $t \\geq 0$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X_{t \\wedge \\tau_{a}}] = 0\n$$\nAs $t \\to \\infty$, because $\\tau_a  \\infty$ almost surely, we have $t \\wedge \\tau_a \\to \\tau_a$ almost surely.

The theorem that guarantees such an interchange is the Dominated Convergence Theorem, whose conditions are encapsulated within the concept of uniform integrability. A sequence of integrable random variables $(Y_t)_{t \\ge 0}$ that converges almost surely to $Y$ also converges in $L^1$ (i.e., $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\mathbb{E}[|Y_t - Y|] = 0$, which implies $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\mathbb{E}[Y_t] = \\mathbb{E}[Y]$) if and only if the sequence $(Y_t)_{t \\ge 0}$ is uniformly integrable (UI).\n\nTherefore, the specific hypothesis that is violated is the uniform integrability of the stopped martingale process $(M_t)_{t\\ge 0} = (X_{t \\wedge \\tau_{a}})_{t\\ge 0}$.\n\nWe can prove by contradiction that $(M_t)_{t\\ge 0}$ is not a uniformly integrable martingale.\nA martingale $(M_t)_{t \\ge 0}$ which converges almost surely to a random variable $M_\\infty$ is uniformly integrable if and only if $M_t = \\mathbb{E}[M_\\infty | \\mathcal{F}_t]$ for all $t \\ge 0$.\nLet us assume, for the sake of contradiction, that our stopped martingale $(M_t)_{t\\ge 0}$ is uniformly integrable. Then, since $M_t \\to X_{\\tau_a}$ a.s., we would have:\n$$\nM_t = \\mathbb{E}[X_{\\tau_a} | \\mathcal{F}_t]\n$$\nTaking the expectation on both sides yields:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[M_t] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{E}[X_{\\tau_a} | \\mathcal{F}_t]] = \\mathbb{E}[X_{\\tau_a}]\n$$\nWe have already established that $\\mathbb{E}[M_t] = 0$ and $\\mathbb{E}[X_{\\tau_a}] = a$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n0 = a\n$$\nThis is a contradiction, since it was given that $a > 0$. The initial assumption must be false. Therefore, the stopped martingale $(X_{t \\wedge \\tau_{a}})_{t \\geq 0}$ is not uniformly integrable.\n\nOther commonly cited conditions for the OST to hold for an unbounded stopping time $\\tau$ and martingale $X_t$ are also violated:\n1.  Boundedness of $\\tau$: The stopping time $\\tau_a$ is not bounded; it can be arbitrarily large. Specifically, $\\mathbb{E}[\\tau_a] = \\infty$.\n2.  The condition $\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\mathbb{E}[X_t \\mathbf{1}_{\\tau_a > t}] = 0$: As shown by a more detailed analysis involving the reflection principle, $\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\mathbb{E}[X_t \\mathbf{1}_{\\tau_a > t}] = -a \\neq 0$.\n\nAll these violations are consequences of the fundamental failure of uniform integrability for the stopped process. The problem's framing, which builds from the stopped process $X_{t \\wedge \\tau_{a}}$, points to the lack of uniform integrability of this process as the most precise and central reason for the OST's failure.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{a}\n$$", "id": "2985422"}]}
