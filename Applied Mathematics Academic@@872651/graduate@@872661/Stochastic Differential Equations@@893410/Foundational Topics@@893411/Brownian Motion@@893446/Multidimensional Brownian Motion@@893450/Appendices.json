In a particular $D$-dimensional crystalline material, the random thermal motion of an exciton can be accurately described as a standard $D$-dimensional Brownian motion.\n\nSuppose at time $t=0$, two excitons, Exciton A and Exciton B, are created at positions $x_A$ and $x_B$ in $\\mathbb{R}^D$, respectively. Their subsequent motions are independent of each other. The initial distance between them is $|x_A - x_B| = d$.\n\nThese excitons can undergo a process known as Auger recombination, where they annihilate each other.

Express your answer as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $d$ and $r$.", "solution": "Let the positions of the two excitons at time $t$ be denoted by the random vectors $X_t$ and $Y_t$ in $\\mathbb{R}^5$. According to the problem statement, $X_t$ and $Y_t$ are independent, 5-dimensional standard Brownian motions. Their initial positions are $X_0 = x_A$ and $Y_0 = x_B$, with the initial condition $|x_A - x_B| = d$. Annihilation occurs if $|X_t - Y_t| \\le r$ for some time $t  0$.\n\nThe key to solving this problem is to analyze the relative motion of the two excitons. Let's define a new process $Z_t = X_t - Y_t$, which represents the vector from Exciton B to Exciton A. The initial state of this process is $Z_0 = x_A - x_B$, so its magnitude is $|Z_0| = d$. The annihilation condition is now simply that the magnitude of $Z_t$ ever reaches the value $r$, i.e., $|Z_t| \\le r$.\n\nSince $X_t$ and $Y_t$ are independent standard Brownian motions, their linear combination $Z_t$ is also a Brownian motion. Let's determine its parameters. $Z_t$ is a Gaussian process with mean $E[Z_t] = E[X_t] - E[Y_t] = 0 - 0 = 0$. For any component $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$, the variance is $\\text{Var}(Z_{t,i}) = \\text{Var}(X_{t,i} - Y_{t,i})$. Due to the independence of $X_t$ and $Y_t$, this becomes $\\text{Var}(X_{t,i}) + \\text{Var}(Y_{t,i}) = t + t = 2t$.\nThis means that $Z_t$ is a 5-dimensional Brownian motion where each component has variance $2t$. We can express this as $Z_t = \\sqrt{2} \\tilde{B}_t$, where $\\tilde{B}_t$ is a 5-dimensional *standard* Brownian motion (whose components have variance $t$).\n\nThe problem is now transformed into finding the probability that the process $Z_t$ starting at $|Z_0| = d$ will ever enter the ball of radius $r$. This is equivalent to finding the probability that the standard Brownian motion $\\tilde{B}_t = Z_t/\\sqrt{2}$, starting at $|\\tilde{B}_0| = |Z_0|/\\sqrt{2} = d/\\sqrt{2}$, ever enters the ball of radius $\\rho = r/\\sqrt{2}$.\n\nFor a standard Brownian motion in $D$ dimensions where $D \\ge 3$, the process is transient, meaning it has a non-zero probability of escaping to infinity. The probability of hitting a sphere of radius $\\rho$ starting from a point $z_0$ with $|z_0|  \\rho$ is less than 1. This probability, let's call it $P(z_0)$, is a harmonic function with respect to the Laplacian operator $\\Delta$, satisfying the exterior Dirichlet problem:\n1. $\\Delta P(z) = 0$ for $|z|  \\rho$.\n2. $P(z) = 1$ for $|z| = \\rho$ (if it starts on the boundary, it has hit it with probability 1).\n3. $P(z) \\to 0$ as $|z| \\to \\infty$ (due to the transient nature of the random walk).\n\nGiven the spherical symmetry of the boundary conditions, the solution $P(z)$ must be radially symmetric, i.e., $P(z) = p(|z|)$. Let $R = |z|$. The Laplacian in $D$ dimensions for a radially symmetric function is $\\Delta p(R) = p''(R) + \\frac{D-1}{R} p'(R)$.\nSetting $\\Delta p = 0$ gives the ordinary differential equation:\n$$p''(R) + \\frac{D-1}{R} p'(R) = 0$$\nLet $q(R) = p'(R)$. The equation becomes $q'(R) = -\\frac{D-1}{R} q(R)$, which is a separable equation.\n$$\\frac{dq}{q} = -\\frac{D-1}{R} dR$$\nIntegrating both sides yields $\\ln|q| = -(D-1)\\ln|R| + C_1$, which implies $q(R) = A R^{-(D-1)}$ for some constant $A$.\nNow, we integrate $p'(R) = q(R)$ to find $p(R)$. For $D \\ne 2$:\n$$p(R) = \\int A R^{-(D-1)} dR = \\frac{A}{2-D} R^{2-D} + B$$\nLet $C = A/(2-D)$. So, $p(R) = C R^{2-D} + B$.\nNow we apply the boundary conditions for our case, where $D=5$.\n1. As $R \\to \\infty$, $p(R) \\to 0$. Since $2-D = -3  0$, $R^{-3} \\to 0$ as $R \\to \\infty$. This implies that the constant $B$ must be 0. So, $p(R) = C R^{2-D}$.\n2. At $R = \\rho$, $p(\\rho) = 1$. This gives $1 = C \\rho^{2-D}$, so $C = \\rho^{D-2}$.\n\nThe final form of the hitting probability is $p(R) = (\\rho/R)^{D-2}$.\n\nWe can now substitute the specific values for our problem. We are in $D=5$. The starting radius for the standard Brownian motion $\\tilde{B}_t$ is $R = d/\\sqrt{2}$ and the target radius is $\\rho = r/\\sqrt{2}$.\nThe probability of annihilation is therefore:\n$$P_\\text{annihilate} = p(d/\\sqrt{2}) = \\left(\\frac{\\rho}{R}\\right)^{D-2} = \\left(\\frac{r/\\sqrt{2}}{d/\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^{5-2} = \\left(\\frac{r}{d}\\right)^3$$\nThe factors of $\\sqrt{2}$ cancel, and the final probability depends only on the ratio of the capture radius to the initial separation distance, raised to the power of $D-2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\left(\\frac{r}{d}\\right)^{3}}$$", "id": "1306775"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the geometric nature of Brownian paths, we now turn to the calculus of systems driven by them.
