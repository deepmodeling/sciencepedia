We shall proceed by deriving the consequences of the given principles and then evaluating each statement.\n\nLet $\\{B_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ be a standard one-dimensional Brownian motion starting at $B_0 = 0$. For a fixed constant $a > 0$, the first hitting time is $T_a = \\inf\\{s \\ge 0: B_s = a\\}$. We consider the stopping time $\\tau = T_a \\wedge t = \\min(T_a, t)$ for a given $t > 0$.\n\nFirst, we apply the Optional Stopping Theorem (OST). The process $\\{B_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ is a martingale with respect to its natural filtration. The stopping time $\\tau$ is bounded above by the fixed time $t$, so $\\tau \\le t$.

On the event $\\{T_a \\le t\\}$, the stopping time is $\\tau = T_a$. By definition of $T_a$ and the continuity of Brownian motion paths, $B_{\\tau} = B_{T_a} = a$. Thus, the first term is:\n    $$\n    \\mathbb{E}[B_{T_a} \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\{T_a \\le t\\}}] = \\mathbb{E}[a \\cdot \\mathbf{1}_{\\{T_a \\le t\\}}] = a\\,\\mathbb{P}(T_a \\le t)\n    $$\n2.

Let $z=a/\\sqrt{t}$. The identity is $2z\\sqrt{t}\\,(1-\\Phi(z)) = \\sqrt{\\frac{t}{2\\pi}} e^{-z^2/2}$.\nThis simplifies to $2z(1-\\Phi(z)) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-z^2/2} = \\phi(z)$, where $\\phi$ is the standard normal PDF.

Therefore, its density must be symmetric about $t/2$, i.e., $f_{\\tau_t}(s) = f_{\\tau_t}(t-s)$.\n$$ c(t-s) \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi s}} = c(s) \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi(t-s)}} \\implies c(t-s)\\sqrt{t-s} = c(s)\\sqrt{s} $$\nThis relation implies that the function $g(u) = c(u)\\sqrt{u}$ must be a constant, say $K$. So, $c(u) = K/\\sqrt{u}$. Substituting this back:\n$$ f_{\\tau_t}(s) = \\frac{K}{\\sqrt{t-s}} \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi s}} = \\frac{K\\sqrt{2/\\pi}}{\\sqrt{s(t-s)}} $$\nFinally, we determine $K$ by the normalization condition $\\int_0^t f_{\\tau_t}(s) \\, ds = 1$. The integral is a standard result related to the Beta function:\n$$ \\int_0^t \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{s(t-s)}} \\, ds = \\pi $$\nThus, we must have $K\\sqrt{2/\\pi} \\cdot \\pi = 1$, which gives $K = 1/\\sqrt{2\\pi}$.\n\n**Step 3: Obtain the marginal density of $\\tau_t$.**\nWith $K$ determined, we have $c(u) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi u}}$. We can now write the final expression for the marginal density of the time of the maximum:\n$$ f_{\\tau_t}(s) = \\frac{K\\sqrt{2/\\pi}}{\\sqrt{s(t-s)}} = \\frac{(1/\\sqrt{2\\pi})\\sqrt{2/\\pi}}{\\sqrt{s(t-s)}} = \\frac{1/\\pi}{\\sqrt{s(t-s)}} = \\frac{1}{\\pi\\sqrt{s(t-s)}} $$\nThis is the celebrated arcsine density, valid for $s \\in (0,t)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\pi \\sqrt{s(t-s)}}}$$", "id": "2993800"}]}
