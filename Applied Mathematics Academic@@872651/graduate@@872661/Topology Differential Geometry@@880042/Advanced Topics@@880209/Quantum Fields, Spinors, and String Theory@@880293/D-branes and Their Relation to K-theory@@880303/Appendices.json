Its worldvolume theory includes a U(1) gauge field $A$, with field strength $F=dA$. The quantum consistency of this theory is sensitive to background fields present in the 10-dimensional spacetime, such as the Neveu-Schwarz B-field, a 2-form. The coupling of the gauge field to the B-field is captured by an effective field strength, $\\mathcal{F} = F - i^*B$, where $i^*B$ denotes the pullback of the B-field to the D-brane's worldvolume.\n\nA fundamental principle, generalizing the Dirac quantization condition for magnetic monopoles, dictates that the flux of this effective field strength $\\mathcal{F}$ must be integrally quantized over any closed 2-dimensional submanifold (a 2-cycle) $\\Sigma$ within the worldvolume. This condition is expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{\\Sigma} \\mathcal{F} = k, \\quad \\text{for some integer } k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\n$$\nThis condition on $\\mathcal{F}$ is required for a consistent quantum theory of open strings ending on the D-brane. A key implication is that the flux of the gauge field strength $F$ alone is not necessarily an integer, as it might need to compensate for a non-integral B-field flux. This is a characteristic feature of D-branes in topologically non-trivial backgrounds, related to the classification of D-brane charges by twisted K-theory.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nConsider a static D4-brane whose worldvolume contains a 2-sphere, $S^2$.
