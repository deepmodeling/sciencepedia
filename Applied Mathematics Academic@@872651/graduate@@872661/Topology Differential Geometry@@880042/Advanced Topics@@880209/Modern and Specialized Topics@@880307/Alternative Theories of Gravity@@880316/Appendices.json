It is often convenient to work in the Einstein frame, where the gravitational action takes the standard Einstein-Hilbert form, at the cost of introducing a non-minimal coupling between the scalar field and matter.\n\nThe transformation to the Einstein frame is achieved via a conformal transformation of the metric:\n$$g^E_{\\mu\\nu} = \\Omega^2(\\phi) g_{\\mu\\nu}$$\nwhere $\\Omega(\\phi)$ is a function of the scalar field.\n\n1.

The Parametrized Post-Newtonian (PPN) parameter $\\gamma$ measures the amount of spatial curvature produced by a unit rest mass.
