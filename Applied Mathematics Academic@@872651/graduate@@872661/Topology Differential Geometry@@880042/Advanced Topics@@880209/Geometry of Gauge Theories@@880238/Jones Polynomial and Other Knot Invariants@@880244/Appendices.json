{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A primary goal in knot theory is to determine if two knots or links are equivalent. To do this, we use invariants—quantities that do not change under continuous deformation. While simple invariants like the linking number are intuitive, they are often not strong enough to distinguish between all non-equivalent links. This exercise [@problem_id:1659448] provides a classic example, the Whitehead link, which has a linking number of zero, just like the simple two-component unlink. By comparing their more sophisticated polynomial invariants, you will see firsthand why tools like the Jones and Conway polynomials are indispensable for proving that two links are truly different.", "problem": "In the field of knot theory, a primary objective is to determine whether two links are equivalent, i.e., whether one can be smoothly deformed into the other without any strands passing through themselves or each other. This is known as link isotopy. To distinguish between non-isotopic links, mathematicians use tools called link invariants: quantities or algebraic objects that are identical for any two isotopic links. If an invariant differs for two links, they are guaranteed to be non-isotopic.\n\nConsider two famous 2-component links: the 2-component unlink ($L_U$), which consists of two simple, non-intersecting, and unlinked circles; and the Whitehead link ($L_W$). We are provided with the values of three different link invariants for these two links. The components of the links are associated with variables $q$ (or $t_1, t_2$) and $z$.\n\n1.  **Linking Number ($lk$)**: This is an integer invariant that measures how many times two components wind around each other.\n    - For the 2-component unlink: $lk(L_U) = 0$.\n    - For the Whitehead link: $lk(L_W) = 0$.\n\n2.  **Jones Polynomial ($V_L(q)$)**: This is a sophisticated polynomial invariant.\n    - For the 2-component unlink: $V_{L_U}(q) = -q^{1/2} - q^{-1/2}$.\n    - For the Whitehead link: $V_{L_W}(q) = q^{-2}(-1 + q - 2q^2 + q^3 - q^4 + q^5)$.\n\n3.  **Conway Polynomial ($\\nabla_L(z)$)**: This is another powerful polynomial invariant, related to the Alexander polynomial.\n    - For the 2-component unlink: $\\nabla_{L_U}(z) = 0$.\n    - For the Whitehead link: $\\nabla_{L_W}(z) = z^2 + 1$.\n\nBased on the provided information, which of the following statements represents a set of necessary and collectively sufficient conclusions?\n\nA. Since the Jones and Conway polynomials are different, the links are not isotopic. However, the linking number being the same suggests they are very similar, and a stronger invariant might show they are, in fact, isotopic.\n\nB. The linking number is a complete invariant for 2-component links, and since it is 0 for both, the Whitehead link must be isotopic to the 2-component unlink. The polynomial invariants must have been calculated incorrectly.\n\nC. The Whitehead link is not isotopic to the 2-component unlink. This is proven by the fact that both their Jones and Conway polynomials differ. This also demonstrates that the linking number is an incomplete invariant, as it fails to distinguish these two non-isotopic links.\n\nD. The linking number is the most fundamental invariant. As it is the same for both links, they are considered equivalent in a weaker sense, even if they are not fully isotopic. The polynomial invariants only describe finer geometric details.\n\nE. We can only conclude that the Whitehead link is not isotopic to the 2-component unlink. We cannot make any definitive statement about the nature of the linking number invariant from this single example.", "solution": "We use the defining property of a link invariant: if two links $L$ and $L'$ are isotopic, then any link invariant $I$ satisfies $I(L)=I(L')$. The contrapositive yields: if there exists any invariant $I$ with $I(L)\\neq I(L')$, then $L$ and $L'$ are not isotopic.\n\nApply this to the given data:\n- For the Jones polynomial, we have\n$$\nV_{L_U}(q)=-q^{1/2}-q^{-1/2}, \\quad V_{L_W}(q)=q^{-2}(-1+q-2q^{2}+q^{3}-q^{4}+q^{5}),\n$$\nwhich are distinct polynomials in $q$. Therefore, by the contrapositive, $L_U$ and $L_W$ are not isotopic.\n- Independently, for the Conway polynomial, we have\n$$\n\\nabla_{L_U}(z)=0, \\quad \\nabla_{L_W}(z)=z^{2}+1,\n$$\nwhich are also distinct, confirming again that $L_U$ and $L_W$ are not isotopic.\n\nNow assess the linking number as an invariant. Both links have\n$$\nlk(L_U)=0, \\quad lk(L_W)=0,\n$$\nyet we have shown $L_U$ and $L_W$ are not isotopic. A complete invariant $I$ must satisfy: if $I(L)=I(L')$, then $L$ and $L'$ are isotopic. The existence of a pair of non-isotopic links with the same value of $I$ shows $I$ is not complete. Hence the linking number is an incomplete invariant.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A is false because differing invariants already prove non-isotopy; no stronger invariant can reverse that conclusion.\n- B is false because the linking number is not complete, as just demonstrated; the polynomial values need not be incorrect.\n- C is true: the links are not isotopic because both their Jones and Conway polynomials differ, and this example shows the linking number is an incomplete invariant.\n- D is misleading: equality of linking number does not establish any equivalence relevant to isotopy; it merely reflects a coarse invariant.\n- E is false: from this single counterexample we can definitively conclude the linking number is not complete.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1659448"}, {"introduction": "Having seen the power of polynomial invariants, we now explore their construction.

This problem involves computing the Alexander polynomial for the stevedore knot ($6_1$).\n\n**Background:**\n\n1.  **Knot Diagram and Regions:** A knot diagram is a 2D projection of the knot with breaks at crossings to indicate which strand passes over and which passes under. The arcs are the segments of the knot between crossings.\n\n2.  **Alexander Matrix:** To compute the Alexander polynomial for a knot with $n$ crossings, we first give the knot an orientation (a direction of travel along the knot). We then label the $n$ crossings $c_1, \\dots, c_n$ and the $n$ arcs $x_1, \\dots, x_n$.\n\n3.  **Crossing Relation:** At each crossing, three arcs meet: one over-strand and two under-strands. Let's say at a given crossing, the over-strand is the arc labeled $x_j$. The under-strand consists of an incoming arc $x_k$ and an outgoing arc $x_l$ (following the knot's orientation). For a right-handed crossing (where the over-strand must be rotated counter-clockwise to align with the oriented under-strand), the associated relation is a linear equation:\n    $$x_l - t x_j + (t-1) x_k = 0$$\n    These $n$ relations for the $n$ crossings form a system of linear equations in the variables $x_1, \\dots, x_n$. The coefficient matrix of this system is the $n \\times n$ Alexander matrix, $A$.\n\n4.  **Alexander Polynomial:** The Alexander matrix has a determinant of 0. The Alexander polynomial is defined as the determinant of any $(n-1) \\times (n-1)$ submatrix (or minor) of $A$, obtained by deleting one row and one column. This polynomial is well-defined up to multiplication by $\\pm t^k$ for an integer $k$.
