## Introduction
In the landscape of modern mathematics and theoretical physics, many interesting spaces are not perfectly smooth manifolds but possess singularities. Orbifolds provide a powerful and elegant framework for studying such spaces, extending the familiar tools of [differential geometry](@entry_id:145818) and topology to a world with well-behaved, localized singular points. While traditional manifold theory falls short in describing these objects, the theory of orbifolds fills this crucial gap, offering a language to precisely define and analyze them. This article serves as a comprehensive introduction to this fascinating topic. The first chapter, **Principles and Mechanisms**, will build the theory from the ground up, defining the local structure of an [orbifold](@entry_id:159587), exploring common constructions like global quotients, and introducing essential tools such as the [orbifold](@entry_id:159587) Euler characteristic and fundamental group. Following this, the **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections** chapter will demonstrate the remarkable utility of these concepts, showing how orbifolds are indispensable in Thurston's Geometrization program, string theory compactifications on Calabi-Yau spaces, and even the study of number theory. Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** section will provide a series of guided problems, allowing you to apply these principles and solidify your understanding of the core concepts.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The transition from manifolds to orbifolds represents a significant conceptual leap in modern geometry, allowing for the rigorous treatment of spaces that possess localized, well-behaved singularities. While a manifold is a space that locally resembles Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, an [orbifold](@entry_id:159587) is a space that locally resembles the quotient of $\mathbb{R}^n$ by a finite group action. This chapter elucidates the fundamental principles that govern the structure of orbifolds, from their local definition to their global topological invariants.

### The Local Structure of an Orbifold

The essence of an [orbifold](@entry_id:159587) lies in its local description. Every point in an [orbifold](@entry_id:159587) possesses a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to the quotient of an open subset of Euclidean space by a [finite group](@entry_id:151756) action. Formally, an **[orbifold](@entry_id:159587) chart** for a point $p$ in an $n$-dimensional [orbifold](@entry_id:159587) $\mathcal{O}$ consists of a triple $(U, G_p, \phi)$, where $U$ is a $G_p$-invariant open neighborhood of a point $\tilde{p}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $G_p$ is a finite group acting on $U$ such that $\tilde{p}$ is a fixed point, and $\phi: U/G_p \to V$ is a [homeomorphism](@entry_id:146933) onto an [open neighborhood](@entry_id:268496) $V$ of $p$ in $\mathcal{O}$.

The group $G_p$ is known as the **local [isotropy](@entry_id:159159) group** or **stabilizer group** at the point $p$. If $G_p$ is the trivial group $\{e\}$, the point $p$ is a **smooth point** or **manifold point**, and its neighborhood is locally Euclidean, just as in a manifold. If $G_p$ is non-trivial, the point $p$ is a **singular point**. The collection of singular points forms the **singular locus** of the [orbifold](@entry_id:159587).

A canonical example of an [orbifold](@entry_id:159587) singularity is the quotient of the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$ by the action of the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_N$. The [group action](@entry_id:143336) is generated by rotation about the origin by an angle of $2\pi/N$. For a point $z \in \mathbb{C}$, the action is $z \mapsto \omega z$, where $\omega = \exp(2\pi i/N)$. The origin $z=0$ is the only point fixed by all non-identity elements of $\mathbb{Z}_N$. The resulting [quotient space](@entry_id:148218) $\mathcal{O} = \mathbb{C}/\mathbb{Z}_N$ has a single singular point at the image of the origin, which is a **conical singularity** of order $N$.

The action of the [isotropy](@entry_id:159159) group $G_p$ on the Euclidean chart induces a [linear representation](@entry_id:139970) on the [tangent space](@entry_id:141028) at the fixed point. This linearization is a cornerstone of [orbifold](@entry_id:159587) theory, as it allows the tools of linear algebra and representation theory to be applied to the study of singularities.

Consider the [orbifold](@entry_id:159587) $\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{Z}_3$, where the generator $g$ of $\mathbb{Z}_3$ acts by $z \mapsto \omega z$ with $\omega = \exp(2\pi i/3)$ [@problem_id:1003441]. We can identify $\mathbb{C}$ with $\mathbb{R}^2$ via $z = x+iy$. The action of $g$ on the coordinates $(x,y)$ is a linear transformation. Since $\omega = -1/2 + i\sqrt{3}/2$, we have:
$$
z' = x' + iy' = \left(-\frac{1}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)(x+iy) = \left(-\frac{1}{2}x - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}y\right) + i\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}x - \frac{1}{2}y\right)
$$
This linear transformation $(x,y) \mapsto (x',y')$ is represented by the matrix $M_g$ acting on the tangent space $T_0\mathbb{C} \cong \mathbb{R}^2$. The matrix is the Jacobian of the transformation:
$$
M_g = \begin{pmatrix} -1/2 & -\sqrt{3}/2 \\ \sqrt{3}/2 & -1/2 \end{pmatrix}
$$
This is the [standard matrix](@entry_id:151240) for a rotation by $2\pi/3$. The trace of this matrix, $\text{Tr}(M_g) = (-1/2) + (-1/2) = -1$, is an important piece of data characterizing the singularity.

### Constructing Orbifolds: Global Quotients

While the local picture defines an [orbifold](@entry_id:159587), many important examples arise as global quotients of a manifold $M$ by a group $G$, written as $\mathcal{O} = M/G$. In this case, for any point $x \in M$, its image $[x] \in \mathcal{O}$ has a local isotropy group isomorphic to the [stabilizer subgroup](@entry_id:137216) $\text{Stab}(x) = \{g \in G \mid g \cdot x = x\}$. The singular points of $\mathcal{O}$ are the images of points in $M$ with non-trivial stabilizers.

A rich class of examples is provided by **weighted [projective spaces](@entry_id:157963)**. The [weighted projective space](@entry_id:157791) $\mathbb{WP}(w_0, \dots, w_n)$ is constructed as the quotient of the sphere $S^{2n+1} \subset \mathbb{C}^{n+1}$ by a weighted action of the circle group $S^1 = U(1)$. The action is defined by a set of coprime integer weights $(w_0, \dots, w_n)$ as:
$$
e^{i\theta} \cdot (z_0, \dots, z_n) = (e^{i\theta w_0} z_0, \dots, e^{i\theta w_n} z_n)
$$
Singular points in $\mathbb{WP}(w_0, \dots, w_n)$ correspond to orbits of points $z \in S^{2n+1}$ whose [stabilizer subgroup](@entry_id:137216) within $S^1$ is non-trivial. A non-trivial stabilizer exists if $e^{i\theta w_j}z_j = z_j$ for all $j$, with $e^{i\theta} \neq 1$. This can only happen if some coordinates $z_j$ are zero.

Let's examine the weighted projective plane $\mathbb{WP}(2,3,5)$ [@problem_id:1003622]. The [singular points](@entry_id:266699) are found by considering points where only one coordinate is non-zero.
- For a point of the form $[1:0:0]$, its representative on $S^{2n+1}$ is $(1,0,0)$. The stabilizer condition is $e^{i\theta \cdot 2} = 1$, which holds for $\theta = \pi, 2\pi$. The stabilizer is the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_2$, so this is a singular point of order 2.
- For a point $[0:1:0]$, the condition is $e^{i\theta \cdot 3} = 1$, yielding a stabilizer group $\mathbb{Z}_3$. This is a singular point of order 3.
- For a point $[0:0:1]$, the condition $e^{i\theta \cdot 5} = 1$ gives a stabilizer $\mathbb{Z}_5$, a [singular point](@entry_id:171198) of order 5.
If two or more coordinates are non-zero, the conditions $e^{i\theta w_j}=1$ and $e^{i\theta w_k}=1$ would imply, since the weights are coprime, that $\theta$ must be a multiple of $2\pi$, corresponding to a trivial stabilizer. Thus, $\mathbb{WP}(2,3,5)$ has exactly three singular points, with isotropy group orders 2, 3, and 5.

### Differential Geometry on Orbifolds

Geometric objects such as functions, vector fields, and differential forms on a quotient [orbifold](@entry_id:159587) $M/G$ are defined as the $G$-invariant counterparts on the covering manifold $M$. For example, a smooth function on $M/G$ is simply a $G$-invariant smooth function on $M$. Similarly, a vector field on $M/G$ corresponds to a $G$-invariant vector field on $M$.

This correspondence allows us to perform calculus on orbifolds, though care must be taken at the singularities. Consider again the [orbifold](@entry_id:159587) $\mathcal{O} = \mathbb{C}/\mathbb{Z}_N$, where the underlying space can be parametrized by the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-invariant coordinate $w = z^N$ [@problem_id:1003452]. Let's examine the vector field $\mathcal{V} = \frac{\partial}{\partial w}$ on the base space. To understand its structure, we "lift" it to the covering $z$-plane. Using the [chain rule](@entry_id:147422), $\frac{\partial}{\partial z} = \frac{\partial w}{\partial z} \frac{\partial}{\partial w} = N z^{N-1} \frac{\partial}{\partial w}$. Rearranging this gives the lift $\tilde{\mathcal{V}}$ of $\mathcal{V}$:
$$
\tilde{\mathcal{V}} = \frac{1}{N z^{N-1}} \frac{\partial}{\partial z}
$$
This demonstrates a key feature: a perfectly smooth vector field on the [orbifold](@entry_id:159587) can lift to a vector field on the covering space that is singular at the fixed points of the [group action](@entry_id:143336) (here, at $z=0$). Operations like the Lie bracket are also well-defined. For instance, the Lie bracket of $\tilde{\mathcal{V}}$ with the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-invariant scaling vector field $\mathcal{U} = z \frac{\partial}{\partial z}$ can be computed directly. Using the formula $[f \frac{\partial}{\partial z}, g \frac{\partial}{\partial z}] = (f g' - g f') \frac{\partial}{\partial z}$, we find:
$$
[\tilde{\mathcal{V}}, \mathcal{U}] = \left[ \frac{1}{N z^{N-1}} \frac{\partial}{\partial z}, z \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \right] = \left( \frac{1}{N z^{N-1}} \cdot 1 - z \cdot \left(-\frac{N-1}{N z^N}\right) \right) \frac{\partial}{\partial z} = \frac{1}{z^{N-1}} \frac{\partial}{\partial z}
$$
The result is another $\mathbb{Z}_N$-invariant vector field on $\mathbb{C}$, corresponding to a well-defined (though singular) vector field on the [orbifold](@entry_id:159587).

### The Orbifold Euler Characteristic

One of the most important [topological invariants](@entry_id:138526) for an [orbifold](@entry_id:159587) is its Euler characteristic, which must account for the singular locus. For a compact, orientable 2-dimensional [orbifold](@entry_id:159587) $\mathcal{O}$, its **rational Euler characteristic** is defined as:
$$
\chi(\mathcal{O}) = \chi(S) - \sum_{i=1}^{k} \left(1 - \frac{1}{n_i}\right)
$$
Here, $S$ is the underlying topological surface, $\chi(S)=2-2g$ is its classical Euler characteristic (with $g$ being the genus), and the sum is over the $k$ cone points, each with isotropy order $n_i$ [@problem_id:1003550]. The term $(1 - 1/n_i)$ can be interpreted as the "topological deficit" introduced by a cone point of order $n_i$. This formula is powerful enough to determine properties of the underlying space. For example, if an [orbifold](@entry_id:159587) is known to have $\chi(\mathcal{O}) = -169/42$ and three cone points of orders 2, 3, and 7, we can find the [genus](@entry_id:267185) of its underlying surface. The total contribution from the singularities is:
$$
\sum_{i} \left(1 - \frac{1}{n_i}\right) = \left(1-\frac{1}{2}\right) + \left(1-\frac{1}{3}\right) + \left(1-\frac{1}{7}\right) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{3} + \frac{6}{7} = \frac{85}{42}
$$
Plugging this into the formula:
$$
-\frac{169}{42} = \chi(S) - \frac{85}{42} \implies \chi(S) = -\frac{169}{42} + \frac{85}{42} = -\frac{84}{42} = -2
$$
Since $\chi(S) = 2 - 2g$, we have $-2 = 2 - 2g$, which gives a genus $g=2$.

A more general and profound definition, applicable to any global quotient [orbifold](@entry_id:159587) $M/G$, was provided by Dixon, Harvey, Vafa, and Witten. The **[orbifold](@entry_id:159587) Euler characteristic** is defined as an average over the group:
$$
\chi_{orb}(M/G) = \frac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} \chi(M^g)
$$
where $|G|$ is the order of the group and $\chi(M^g)$ is the standard Euler characteristic of the fixed-point [submanifold](@entry_id:262388) $M^g = \{x \in M \mid g \cdot x = x\}$ [@problem_id:1003498].

To see this formula in action, consider an [orbifold](@entry_id:159587) $\mathcal{O} = \Sigma_g / \mathbb{Z}_2$, where $\Sigma_g$ is a closed [orientable surface](@entry_id:274245) of [genus](@entry_id:267185) $g$ and the non-trivial element $\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}_2$ has a fixed-point set consisting of $k$ distinct points [@problem_id:1003498]. The group is $\mathbb{Z}_2 = \{e, \gamma\}$.
- For the [identity element](@entry_id:139321) $e$, the fixed-point set is the entire surface, $\Sigma_g^e = \Sigma_g$, so $\chi(\Sigma_g^e) = 2 - 2g$.
- For the element $\gamma$, the fixed-point set is given as $k$ points, $\Sigma_g^\gamma = \{p_1, \dots, p_k\}$, so its Euler characteristic is $\chi(\Sigma_g^\gamma) = k$.
Applying the formula, we get:
$$
\chi_{orb}(\mathcal{O}) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \chi(\Sigma_g^e) + \chi(\Sigma_g^\gamma) \right) = \frac{1}{2}(2 - 2g + k) = 1 - g + \frac{k}{2}
$$
This formula can handle more complex scenarios, such as the [orbifold](@entry_id:159587) $(S^2 \times S^2) / (\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_k)$ [@problem_id:1003470], where one must carefully compute the fixed-point sets and their Euler characteristics for every element of the acting group. The final result for that case, remarkably, simplifies to $\chi_{orb} = 3$, independent of $k$.

### The Orbifold Fundamental Group

The standard fundamental group $\pi_1$ does not fully capture the topology of an [orbifold](@entry_id:159587), as it fails to register the singular structure. The **[orbifold](@entry_id:159587) fundamental group**, $\pi_1^{\text{orb}}$, remedies this. For a 2-[orbifold](@entry_id:159587) whose underlying space is a sphere $S^2$ with $k$ cone points of orders $n_1, \dots, n_k$, denoted $S^2(n_1, \dots, n_k)$, the fundamental group has the presentation:
$$
\pi_1^{\text{orb}}(S^2(n_1, \dots, n_k)) = \langle c_1, \dots, c_k \mid c_1^{n_1} = \dots = c_k^{n_k} = 1, c_1 c_2 \dots c_k = 1 \rangle
$$
Each generator $c_i$ corresponds to a loop around the $i$-th singular point. The relation $c_i^{n_i}=1$ encodes the fact that traversing this loop $n_i$ times makes it contractible in the [orbifold](@entry_id:159587) sense. The relation $c_1 \dots c_k = 1$ arises because a loop enclosing all singularities is contractible on the sphere.

As an example, consider the quotient of a [2-torus](@entry_id:265991) $T^2$ by a $\mathbb{Z}_4$ action generated by $(x,y) \mapsto (-y,x)$. The resulting [orbifold](@entry_id:159587) has the underlying topology of a sphere with two [singular points](@entry_id:266699) of order 4 and one of order 2, denoted $S^2(4,4,2)$ [@problem_id:1003444]. Its [orbifold](@entry_id:159587) fundamental group is:
$$
\pi_1^{\text{orb}} = \langle c_1, c_2, c_3 \mid c_1^4 = 1, c_2^4 = 1, c_3^2 = 1, c_1 c_2 c_3 = 1 \rangle
$$
To understand the structure of this [non-abelian group](@entry_id:144791), we can study its abelianization by adding relations that force the generators to commute. In additive notation, the relations become $4c_1=0$, $4c_2=0$, $2c_3=0$, and $c_1+c_2+c_3=0$. We can use the last relation to eliminate $c_3 = -c_1-c_2$. The relation $2c_3=0$ then becomes $2(-c_1-c_2)=0$, or $2c_1+2c_2=0$. The abelianized group is thus $(\mathbb{Z}_4 \oplus \mathbb{Z}_4) / \langle(2,2)\rangle$. The order of this group is $(4 \times 4)/2 = 8$.

### Advanced Structures: Inertia Orbifold and Stringy Invariants

For applications in quantum [field theory](@entry_id:155241) and string theory, the [orbifold](@entry_id:159587) itself is often just the starting point. A richer object is the **inertia [orbifold](@entry_id:159587)** or **loop [orbifold](@entry_id:159587)**, $\Lambda \mathcal{O}$. For a global quotient $\mathcal{O}=M/G$, it is defined as the disjoint union of components, one for each conjugacy class $[g]$ in $G$:
$$
\Lambda \mathcal{O} = \bigsqcup_{[g] \in \text{Conj}(G)} M^g / C(g)
$$
Here, $M^g$ is the fixed-point set of $g$, and $C(g)$ is the [centralizer](@entry_id:146604) of $g$ in $G$. The component corresponding to the identity element $[e]$ is $M^e/C(e) = M/G = \mathcal{O}$, called the **untwisted sector**. The union of all other components is the **twisted sector**. Each twisted sector corresponds physically to states of a "string" that is closed only up to the group transformation $g$.

Let's find the number of connected components in the twisted sector of the [orbifold](@entry_id:159587) $\mathcal{O} = T^3 / (\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2)$ [@problem_id:1003426]. The group $G = \{e, g_1, g_2, g_3\}$ is abelian, so each element is its own [conjugacy class](@entry_id:138270) and its centralizer is the whole group $G$. We analyze the fixed-point sets for the three non-trivial elements. For $g_1(x,y,z)=(-x,-y,z)$, the fixed points on $T^3=\mathbb{R}^3/\mathbb{Z}^3$ are those where $x,y \in \{0, 1/2\}$ and $z$ is any point on the circle $S^1$. Thus, $M^{g_1}$ consists of four disjoint circles. The quotient $M^{g_1}/G$ consists of four components. By symmetry, the same holds for $g_2$ and $g_3$. Therefore, the twisted sector has a total of $4+4+4=12$ [connected components](@entry_id:141881).

Associated with each twisted sector is a numerical invariant. For cyclic orbifolds $\mathbb{C}^n/\mathbb{Z}_k$ with action defined by weights $(w_1, \dots, w_n)$, the **age** of the twisted sector associated with the group element $g^m$ ($m=1,\dots,k-1$) is defined as:
$$
A_m = \sum_{j=1}^n \left\{ \frac{m w_j}{k} \right\}
$$
where $\{x\} = x - \lfloor x \rfloor$ is the fractional part of $x$ [@problem_id:1003419]. For the [orbifold](@entry_id:159587) $\mathbb{C}^3/\mathbb{Z}_{11}$ with weights $(1,3,5)$, the sum of the ages over all non-trivial twisted sectors is $S = \sum_{m=1}^{10} A_m$. Since each weight $w_j$ is coprime to $k=11$, the set of values $\{mw_j \pmod{11}\}$ for $m=1, \dots, 10$ is just a permutation of $\{1, \dots, 10\}$. Therefore:
$$
\sum_{m=1}^{10} \left\{ \frac{m w_j}{11} \right\} = \sum_{r=1}^{10} \frac{r}{11} = \frac{1}{11} \frac{10(11)}{2} = 5
$$
Since there are three weights, the total sum of ages is $S = 5+5+5=15$.

Finally, combining the concepts of the inertia [orbifold](@entry_id:159587) and the [orbifold](@entry_id:159587) Euler characteristic yields the **stringy Euler characteristic**, defined as:
$$
\chi_{\text{str}}(M/G) = \sum_{[g] \in \text{Conj}(G)} \chi_{\text{orb}}(M^g / C(g))
$$
This invariant is the sum of the [orbifold](@entry_id:159587) Euler characteristics of all components of the inertia [orbifold](@entry_id:159587). Let's compute this for the spindle [orbifold](@entry_id:159587) $S^2(N,N) = S^2/\mathbb{Z}_N$ [@problem_id:1003532]. The group $G=\mathbb{Z}_N$ is abelian.
- For $g=e$, the component is $S^2/\mathbb{Z}_N$, which has $\chi_{orb} = \chi(S^2) - 2(1 - 1/N) = 2/N$.
- For any $g \neq e$, the fixed-point set $M^g$ consists of the two poles of rotation. The quotient $M^g/G$ is a set of two points, each forming a [singular point](@entry_id:171198) of the sub-[orbifold](@entry_id:159587) with isotropy group $\mathbb{Z}_N$. The [orbifold](@entry_id:159587) Euler characteristic of this 0-dimensional space is the sum of the reciprocals of the [isotropy](@entry_id:159159) group orders, yielding $\chi_{orb}(M^g/G) = 1/N + 1/N = 2/N$.
Summing over all $N$ elements of the group (1 identity and $N-1$ non-identity elements):
$$
\chi_{\text{str}}(S^2/\mathbb{Z}_N) = \frac{2}{N} + (N-1) \times \frac{2}{N} = N \times \frac{2}{N} = 2
$$
The stringy Euler characteristic is simply 2, the Euler characteristic of the original sphere, hinting at a deep connection between the "stringy" geometry of the [orbifold](@entry_id:159587) and the smooth geometry of its resolution.

### Orbi-Bundles on Weighted Projective Spaces

The concepts of vector bundles and line bundles from manifold theory generalize to **orbi-bundles** on orbifolds. On the weighted projective line $\mathbb{WP}(w_0, w_1)$ (with $\gcd(w_0,w_1)=1$), one can define a series of orbi-line bundles $\mathcal{O}(d)$ for any integer $d$. The geometry of the [orbifold](@entry_id:159587) is encoded in these bundles. The **canonical orbi-bundle** $K_{\mathbb{WP}(w_0, w_1)}$, which is the bundle of top-degree forms, is isomorphic to $\mathcal{O}(-w_0 - w_1)$. The **degree** of an orbi-line bundle, a rational number measuring its "size", is given by $\deg(\mathcal{O}(d)) = d/(w_0 w_1)$ [@problem_id:1003526].

Using these facts, we can calculate the degree of the canonical orbi-bundle on $\mathbb{WP}(3,5)$. Here, $w_0=3$ and $w_1=5$. The canonical bundle is $K_{\mathbb{WP}(3,5)} \cong \mathcal{O}(-3-5) = \mathcal{O}(-8)$. Its degree is therefore:
$$
\deg(K_{\mathbb{WP}(3,5)}) = \frac{-8}{3 \cdot 5} = -\frac{8}{15}
$$
This simple calculation illustrates how the weights defining the [orbifold](@entry_id:159587) structure directly influence its algebraic and differential geometric properties.
