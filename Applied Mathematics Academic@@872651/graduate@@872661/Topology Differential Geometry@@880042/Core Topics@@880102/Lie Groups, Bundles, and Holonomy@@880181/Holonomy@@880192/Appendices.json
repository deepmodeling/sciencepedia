This first practice provides a classic and tangible example: calculating the holonomy group element for a vector transported around a loop on the surface of a cone [@problem_id:966034]. Although a cone can be constructed from a flat sheet of paper, implying zero curvature on its surface, the apex introduces a singularity where curvature is concentrated. This exercise beautifully demonstrates how this localized curvature manifests as a rotation of the vector, providing a direct geometric interpretation of holonomy as an \"angle deficit.\"", "problem": "Consider a right circular cone embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, with its apex at the origin. The cone is defined by a constant half-apex angle $\\alpha \\in (0, \\pi/2)$.
