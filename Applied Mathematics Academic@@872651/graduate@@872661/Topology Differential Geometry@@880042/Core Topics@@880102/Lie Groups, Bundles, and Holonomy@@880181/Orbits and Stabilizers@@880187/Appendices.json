The set of rotational symmetries of a cube, which are the rigid rotations in 3D space that map the cube onto itself, forms a group $G$. Consider the task of labeling the 8 vertices of the cube. A labeling is defined as a bijective map from the set of 8 vertices, $V$, to the set of labels, $L = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\}$. This means each vertex is assigned a unique label from $L$.\n\nTwo labelings are considered equivalent if one can be transformed into the other by a rotation of the cube. The task is to count the number of distinct (i.e., non-equivalent) labelings.\n\nDetermine the total number of distinct ways to label the 8 vertices of a cube with unique labels from the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\}$.", "solution": "We use Burnside’s Lemma to count the number of orbits of the action of the rotation group $G$ of the cube (of order $|G|=24$) on the set of all bijective labelings $f:V\\to L$ where $|L|=8$.  \n1.
