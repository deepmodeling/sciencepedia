## Introduction
Homology groups are powerful algebraic invariants in topology, famously described as a rigorous method for "counting holes" of different dimensions within a space. Their ability to translate complex geometric shapes into computable algebraic data makes them a cornerstone of modern mathematics and its applications. However, while the foundational definition of [singular homology](@entry_id:158380) is elegant, its direct application is often computationally intractable for all but the simplest spaces. The real power of homology theory lies in a sophisticated toolkit developed to bypass these brute-force calculations and solve for homology groups effectively.

This article provides a comprehensive guide to this computational machinery, addressing the gap between abstract definitions and practical application. We will explore the key structural components and theorems that allow topologists to determine the homology of a vast array of spaces. The first chapter, "Principles and Mechanisms," delves into the core techniques, from the combinatorial approach of [cellular homology](@entry_id:157864) to the algebraic power of long [exact sequences](@entry_id:151503), the Künneth theorem, and [spectral sequences](@entry_id:158626). The second chapter, "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections," showcases how these tools are applied to solve concrete problems in knot theory, group theory, algebraic geometry, and even emerging fields like data analysis. Finally, "Hands-On Practices" will offer targeted exercises to solidify your understanding of these methods. By navigating these chapters, you will move from abstract theory to a practical mastery of computing and applying homology groups.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The computation of homology groups, while conceptually grounded in the simple idea of counting holes, relies on a sophisticated and powerful set of algebraic and topological tools. Once the foundational definitions are in place, the focus shifts from the abstract definition of [singular homology](@entry_id:158380) to concrete, effective methods for calculation. This chapter details the principal mechanisms used by topologists to determine the homology groups of various spaces, moving from foundational techniques for simple structures to powerful machinery capable of handling complex constructions like [fiber bundles](@entry_id:154670) and space complements.

### Cellular Homology: A Combinatorial Approach

For spaces that admit a **CW complex** structure, the most direct computational method is often **[cellular homology](@entry_id:157864)**. A CW complex is built inductively by attaching cells of increasing dimension. This combinatorial structure is mirrored in an algebraic object called the [cellular chain complex](@entry_id:160435), which often has far fewer generators than the corresponding singular [chain complex](@entry_id:150246), dramatically simplifying calculations.

For a CW complex $X$, the **cellular chain group** $C_n^{\text{CW}}(X)$ is the free abelian group generated by the $n$-cells of $X$. The core of the method lies in the definition of the **boundary map** $d_n: C_n^{\text{CW}}(X) \to C_{n-1}^{\text{CW}}(X)$. If $e^n_{\alpha}$ is an $n$-cell attached via a map $\phi_{\alpha}: S^{n-1} \to X^{n-1}$ (the $(n-1)$-skeleton), the boundary $d_n(e^n_{\alpha})$ is a [linear combination](@entry_id:155091) of the $(n-1)$-cells, written as $\sum_{\beta} d_{\alpha\beta} e^{n-1}_{\beta}$. The coefficient $d_{\alpha\beta}$ is the **degree** of the composite map:
$$ S^{n-1}_{\alpha} \xrightarrow{\phi_{\alpha}} X^{n-1} \to X^{n-1} / (X^{n-1} \setminus e^{n-1}_{\beta}) \cong S^{n-1}_{\beta} $$
This degree counts, with sign, how many times the boundary of $e^n_{\alpha}$ wraps around the sphere corresponding to the cell $e^{n-1}_{\beta}$. The homology of this [cellular chain complex](@entry_id:160435), $H_n(C_*^{\text{CW}}(X), d)$, is isomorphic to the [singular homology](@entry_id:158380) $H_n(X; \mathbb{Z})$.

This technique extends naturally to **[relative homology](@entry_id:159348)** $H_n(X, A)$, where $A$ is a [subcomplex](@entry_id:264130) of $X$. The relative cellular chain group $C_n(X, A)$ is simply $C_n(X) / C_n(A)$, which is the free abelian group on the cells of $X$ that are not in $A$.

Consider, for example, a space $X$ built from a single 0-cell $p$, a 1-cell $e^1$ attached to $p$ (forming a circle), and a 2-cell $e^2$ also attached to $p$. This space is the [wedge sum](@entry_id:270607) $S^2 \vee S^1$. Let $A$ be the 1-skeleton, which is just the circle $S^1$. To compute $H_2(X, A)$, we examine the relative [cellular chain complex](@entry_id:160435). The only cell in $X$ but not in $A$ is the 2-cell $e^2$. Thus, the relative cellular chain groups are $C_2(X, A) \cong \mathbb{Z}$, and $C_n(X, A) = 0$ for all $n \ne 2$. The boundary map $d_2: C_2(X, A) \to C_1(X, A)$ must be the zero map since the target group is zero. Consequently, the kernel of $d_2$ is all of $C_2(X, A) \cong \mathbb{Z}$, and the image of the next boundary map $d_3$ is zero. The definition of homology, $H_n = \ker(d_n) / \text{im}(d_{n+1})$, immediately gives $H_2(X, A) \cong \mathbb{Z}$. The **rank** of this group, also known as the second Betti number, is 1 [@problem_id:968992].

### Exact Sequences: Relating Homology Groups

Much of the power of homology theory comes not from direct computation, but from its ability to relate the homology of different spaces or a space and its subspaces. The primary tool for this is the **[long exact sequence](@entry_id:153438)**.

#### The Long Exact Sequence of a Pair

For any pair of spaces $(X, A)$ where $A$ is a subspace of $X$, there exists a [long exact sequence](@entry_id:153438) connecting their homology groups:
$$ \dots \to H_n(A) \xrightarrow{i_*} H_n(X) \xrightarrow{j_*} H_n(X, A) \xrightarrow{\partial_n} H_{n-1}(A) \to \dots $$
Here, $i_*$ is induced by the inclusion $i: A \hookrightarrow X$, $j_*$ is induced by the inclusion of pairs $j: (X, \emptyset) \hookrightarrow (X, A)$, and $\partial_n$ is the crucial **[connecting homomorphism](@entry_id:160713)**. Exactness means that at each group, the image of the incoming map is precisely the kernel of the outgoing map. This sequence allows us to deduce information about one of the three sets of groups—$H_*(A)$, $H_*(X)$, or the relative groups $H_*(X, A)$—if we know the other two.

A particularly useful situation arises when $(X, A)$ is a **good pair**, meaning $A$ is a [closed subspace](@entry_id:267213) that is a [deformation retract](@entry_id:154224) of some neighborhood in $X$. For such pairs, the [relative homology](@entry_id:159348) is isomorphic to the [reduced homology](@entry_id:274187) of the [quotient space](@entry_id:148218), $H_n(X, A) \cong \tilde{H}_n(X/A)$. This often simplifies the relative group to something recognizable. For example, the pair $(\mathbb{R}P^n, \mathbb{R}P^{n-1})$ is a good pair, and the quotient $\mathbb{R}P^n / \mathbb{R}P^{n-1}$ is homeomorphic to the $n$-sphere $S^n$. Therefore, $H_n(\mathbb{R}P^n, \mathbb{R}P^{n-1}; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \tilde{H}_n(S^n; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}$.

Let's use this to analyze a piece of the [long exact sequence](@entry_id:153438) for this pair when $n \ge 2$ is even:
$$ \dots \to H_n(\mathbb{R}P^n) \to H_n(\mathbb{R}P^n, \mathbb{R}P^{n-1}) \xrightarrow{\partial_n} H_{n-1}(\mathbb{R}P^{n-1}) \to H_{n-1}(\mathbb{R}P^n) \to \dots $$
For an even $n$, the known homology groups are $H_n(\mathbb{R}P^n) = 0$ and $H_{n-1}(\mathbb{R}P^{n-1}) \cong \mathbb{Z}_2$ (since $n-1$ is odd). The sequence becomes:
$$ \dots \to 0 \to \mathbb{Z} \xrightarrow{\partial_n} \mathbb{Z}_2 \to \dots $$
The [connecting homomorphism](@entry_id:160713) $\partial_n$ can be understood from the cellular perspective. The cellular boundary map $d_n: C_n(\mathbb{R}P^n) \to C_{n-1}(\mathbb{R}P^n)$ is multiplication by $1 + (-1)^n$. For even $n$, this is multiplication by 2. The [connecting homomorphism](@entry_id:160713) $\partial_n$ in the [long exact sequence](@entry_id:153438) captures this algebraic fact. It maps a generator of $H_n(\mathbb{R}P^n, \mathbb{R}P^{n-1}) \cong \mathbb{Z}$ to the class representing twice a generator in $H_{n-1}(\mathbb{R}P^{n-1})$. Since $H_{n-1}(\mathbb{R}P^{n-1}) \cong \mathbb{Z}_2$, multiplication by 2 is the zero map. The image of $\partial_n$ is therefore trivial, and its cokernel is $\mathbb{Z}_2 / \{0\} \cong \mathbb{Z}_2$, a group of order 2 [@problem_id:969034].

#### The Mayer-Vietoris Sequence

A related and immensely useful tool is the **Mayer-Vietoris sequence**, which arises from the Excision Theorem. It applies to a space $X$ that is the union of two subspaces, $X = U \cup V$. It relates the homology of $X$ to the homology of $U$, $V$, and their intersection $A = U \cap V$:
$$ \dots \to H_n(A) \xrightarrow{\Phi_n} H_n(U) \oplus H_n(V) \xrightarrow{\Psi_n} H_n(X) \xrightarrow{\delta_n} H_{n-1}(A) \to \dots $$
The map $\Phi_n$ is $(i_*, -j_*)$ where $i: A \hookrightarrow U$ and $j: A \hookrightarrow V$ are inclusions. The map $\Psi_n$ is $k_* + l_*$ where $k: U \hookrightarrow X$ and $l: V \hookrightarrow X$ are inclusions. This sequence is ideal for computing the homology of a space constructed by gluing two simpler spaces together.

Let's construct a space $X$ by taking two copies of $\mathbb{R}P^3$ and gluing them along a common subspace homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}P^2$ [@problem_id:969038]. Here, $U \cong \mathbb{R}P^3$, $V \cong \mathbb{R}P^3$, and their intersection is $A \cong \mathbb{R}P^2$. To find $H_2(X; \mathbb{Z})$, we look at the relevant portion of the Mayer-Vietoris sequence:
$$ H_2(U) \oplus H_2(V) \to H_2(X) \xrightarrow{\delta_2} H_1(A) \xrightarrow{\Phi_1} H_1(U) \oplus H_1(V) $$
The known [integral homology](@entry_id:276347) groups are $H_2(\mathbb{R}P^3) = 0$, $H_1(\mathbb{R}P^2) \cong \mathbb{Z}_2$, and $H_1(\mathbb{R}P^3) \cong \mathbb{Z}_2$. Substituting these into the sequence gives:
$$ 0 \oplus 0 \to H_2(X) \xrightarrow{\delta_2} \mathbb{Z}_2 \xrightarrow{\Phi_1} \mathbb{Z}_2 \oplus \mathbb{Z}_2 $$
By [exactness](@entry_id:268999), $H_2(X)$ is isomorphic to the kernel of $\Phi_1$. The map $\Phi_1 = (i_*, -j_*)$ acts on the generator of $H_1(\mathbb{R}P^2) \cong \mathbb{Z}_2$. Since the inclusions of $\mathbb{R}P^2$ into both copies of $\mathbb{R}P^3$ are standard, they induce isomorphisms on $H_1$. Thus, $\Phi_1$ maps the generator $g \in \mathbb{Z}_2$ to $(g, -g)$. In $\mathbb{Z}_2 \oplus \mathbb{Z}_2$, $-g=g$, so the image is $(g, g)$, which is non-zero. The map $\Phi_1$ is injective. Therefore, its kernel is trivial, which implies $H_2(X; \mathbb{Z}) = 0$. The order of its [torsion subgroup](@entry_id:139454) is 1.

### Homology of Composite Spaces

#### Product Spaces and the Künneth Theorem

When dealing with [product spaces](@entry_id:151693) $X \times Y$, their homology is related to the homology of the factors $X$ and $Y$ by the **Künneth Theorem**. For [integral homology](@entry_id:276347), the relationship is subtle and involves not just the tensor product but also the torsion product of the homology groups. The Künneth formula states there is a [split short exact sequence](@entry_id:159775), which yields the [isomorphism](@entry_id:137127):
$$ H_n(X \times Y; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \left( \bigoplus_{i+j=n} H_i(X) \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} H_j(Y) \right) \oplus \left( \bigoplus_{i+j=n-1} \mathrm{Tor}_1^{\mathbb{Z}}(H_i(X), H_j(Y)) \right) $$
The **tensor product** $\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}}$ combines the free and torsion parts of the groups, while the **torsion product functor** $\mathrm{Tor}_1^{\mathbb{Z}}$ captures the interaction between their torsion subgroups. Key properties include:
*   $G \otimes \mathbb{Z} \cong G$.
*   $\mathbb{Z}_m \otimes \mathbb{Z}_n \cong \mathbb{Z}_{\gcd(m,n)}$.
*   $\mathrm{Tor}_1^{\mathbb{Z}}(A, B) = 0$ if either $A$ or $B$ is a free group (torsion-free).
*   $\mathrm{Tor}_1^{\mathbb{Z}}(\mathbb{Z}_m, \mathbb{Z}_n) \cong \mathbb{Z}_{\gcd(m,n)}$.

Let's use this to compute the third homology group of $M = L(p,1) \times L(q,1)$, where $L(k,1)$ is a 3-dimensional lens space [@problem_id:969002]. The [integral homology](@entry_id:276347) of a lens space $L(k,1)$ is $H_0 \cong \mathbb{Z}$, $H_1 \cong \mathbb{Z}_k$, $H_2 = 0$, and $H_3 \cong \mathbb{Z}$.

For $H_3(M; \mathbb{Z})$, we need to sum over $i+j=3$ for the tensor part and $i+j=2$ for the Tor part.

**Tensor Part ($i+j=3$):**
*   $(i,j)=(0,3): H_0(L_p) \otimes H_3(L_q) = \mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z} \cong \mathbb{Z}$.
*   $(i,j)=(1,2): H_1(L_p) \otimes H_2(L_q) = \mathbb{Z}_p \otimes 0 = 0$.
*   $(i,j)=(2,1): H_2(L_p) \otimes H_1(L_q) = 0 \otimes \mathbb{Z}_q = 0$.
*   $(i,j)=(3,0): H_3(L_p) \otimes H_0(L_q) = \mathbb{Z} \otimes \mathbb{Z} \cong \mathbb{Z}$.
This gives a free part of $\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}$.

**Tor Part ($i+j=2$):**
*   $(i,j)=(0,2)$ and $(2,0)$: These involve a [free group](@entry_id:143667) $H_0$ or a zero group $H_2$, so the Tor term is zero.
*   $(i,j)=(1,1): \mathrm{Tor}_1^{\mathbb{Z}}(H_1(L_p), H_1(L_q)) = \mathrm{Tor}_1^{\mathbb{Z}}(\mathbb{Z}_p, \mathbb{Z}_q) \cong \mathbb{Z}_{\gcd(p,q)}$.
This gives a torsion part of $\mathbb{Z}_{\gcd(p,q)}$.

Combining these, we get $H_3(L(p,1) \times L(q,1); \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}^2 \oplus \mathbb{Z}_{\gcd(p,q)}$. The [torsion subgroup](@entry_id:139454) is $\mathbb{Z}_{\gcd(p,q)}$, which has order $\gcd(p,q)$.

#### Mapping Cones

A related construction is the **[mapping cone](@entry_id:261103)** $C_f$ of a map $f: X \to Y$. It is formed by taking the cylinder $X \times [0,1]$ and gluing its top face $X \times \{1\}$ to $Y$ via the map $f$. There is a [long exact sequence](@entry_id:153438) for the homology of the [mapping cone](@entry_id:261103):
$$ \dots \to H_k(X) \xrightarrow{f_*} H_k(Y) \to H_k(C_f) \to H_{k-1}(X) \to \dots $$
This sequence is fundamental for understanding how attaching a space $X$ to a space $Y$ affects homology.

### The Influence of Coefficients

Homology can be defined with coefficients in any abelian group $G$, not just the integers $\mathbb{Z}$. The resulting groups, denoted $H_n(X; G)$, can reveal different aspects of the space's topology.

#### The Universal Coefficient Theorem

The **Universal Coefficient Theorem (UCT)** for homology relates homology with arbitrary coefficients $G$ to [integral homology](@entry_id:276347). It provides an [isomorphism](@entry_id:137127):
$$ H_n(X; G) \cong (H_n(X; \mathbb{Z}) \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}} G) \oplus \mathrm{Tor}_1^{\mathbb{Z}}(H_{n-1}(X; \mathbb{Z}), G) $$
This theorem is a powerful computational tool. For instance, if the coefficient group $G$ is a field of characteristic zero, like the rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$, then $\mathrm{Tor}_1^{\mathbb{Z}}$ vanishes and $A \otimes \mathbb{Q}$ simply "kills" the torsion part of any group $A$. Thus, $H_n(X; \mathbb{Q})$ is a vector space over $\mathbb{Q}$ whose dimension is exactly the rank of $H_n(X; \mathbb{Z})$ (the Betti number $b_n$).

If we use coefficients in a finite field $\mathbb{Z}_p$, the UCT can detect $p$-torsion. The calculation from problem **969115**, involving the homology of a [mapping cone](@entry_id:261103) $C_f$ for a degree $d$ map $f:S^2 \times S^2 \to S^4$, illustrates this perfectly. After finding the [integral homology](@entry_id:276347) groups of $C_f$ using the [mapping cone](@entry_id:261103) LES, the UCT is applied with coefficients $\mathbb{Z}_p$ and $\mathbb{Z}_q$. The dimensions of the resulting homology vector spaces depend critically on whether $p$ and $q$ divide the degree $d$, because terms like $(\mathbb{Z}/d\mathbb{Z}) \otimes \mathbb{Z}_{\ell}$ and $\mathrm{Tor}_1(\mathbb{Z}/d\mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Z}_{\ell})$ simplify to $\mathbb{Z}_{\gcd(d, \ell)}$, whose dimension as a $\mathbb{Z}_\ell$-vector space is 1 if $\ell | d$ and 0 otherwise. This allows one to distinguish topological features based on arithmetic properties of the map's degree.

#### The Bockstein Homomorphism

Short [exact sequences](@entry_id:151503) of coefficient groups give rise to long [exact sequences](@entry_id:151503) in homology. A canonical example is the sequence $0 \to \mathbb{Z} \xrightarrow{\times 2} \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}_2 \to 0$. The associated [long exact sequence](@entry_id:153438) in homology is:
$$ \dots \to H_n(X; \mathbb{Z}) \xrightarrow{\times 2} H_n(X; \mathbb{Z}) \to H_n(X; \mathbb{Z}_2) \xrightarrow{\beta} H_{n-1}(X; \mathbb{Z}) \to \dots $$
The [connecting homomorphism](@entry_id:160713) $\beta$ is called the **Bockstein homomorphism**. It detects elements in $H_n(X; \mathbb{Z}_2)$ that are "reductions mod 2" of [torsion elements](@entry_id:148301) of order 2 in $H_{n-1}(X; \mathbb{Z})$.

Consider the Klein bottle $K$, whose first [integral homology](@entry_id:276347) group is $H_1(K; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}_2$. The Bockstein $\beta: H_2(K; \mathbb{Z}_2) \to H_1(K; \mathbb{Z})$ provides a way to locate this $\mathbb{Z}_2$ subgroup. The [cellular chain complex](@entry_id:160435) of the Klein bottle reveals that the boundary of the 2-cell $f$ is $2b$, where $b$ is one of the 1-cells. With $\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients, this boundary becomes 0, so $[f]$ represents a non-trivial class in $H_2(K; \mathbb{Z}_2) \cong \mathbb{Z}_2$. The Bockstein homomorphism acts on this class by "lifting" it to integer chains, taking the boundary, and dividing by 2. In this case, $\beta([f])$ corresponds to the class of the chain $\frac{1}{2}(\partial_2 f) = \frac{1}{2}(2b) = b$. The class $[b]$ in $H_1(K; \mathbb{Z})$ is precisely the generator of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ [torsion subgroup](@entry_id:139454). Thus, the image of $\beta$ is a subgroup of order 2 [@problem_id:969015].

### Advanced Machinery and Broader Connections

#### Duality Theorems

In the study of manifolds, homology exhibits remarkable duality properties. For a compact, oriented $n$-manifold $M$, **Poincaré duality** provides an [isomorphism](@entry_id:137127) $H_k(M) \cong H^{n-k}(M)$, relating homology to cohomology. A more general result is **Alexander Duality**. For a compact, non-empty, and locally contractible subspace $A \subset S^n$, it gives an isomorphism:
$$ \tilde{H}_k(S^n \setminus A; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \tilde{H}^{n-k-1}(A; \mathbb{Z}) $$
This powerful theorem relates the homology of the complement of a space to the cohomology of the space itself.

To find the second Betti number of the complement of a standardly embedded torus $T^2$ in the 4-sphere $S^4$, we can apply Alexander Duality [@problem_id:969111]. Let $X = S^4 \setminus T^2$. The duality gives:
$$ H_2(X) \cong \tilde{H}_2(X) \cong \tilde{H}^{4-2-1}(T^2) = \tilde{H}^1(T^2; \mathbb{Z}) $$
Since the torus is connected, $\tilde{H}^1(T^2) = H^1(T^2)$. The Universal Coefficient Theorem for cohomology states that $H^1(T^2; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathrm{Hom}(H_1(T^2; \mathbb{Z}), \mathbb{Z})$. Since $H_1(T^2; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}^2$, we have $\mathrm{Hom}(\mathbb{Z}^2, \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}^2$. Therefore, $H_2(S^4 \setminus T^2; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}^2$, and its second Betti number is 2.

#### Spectral Sequences

For more complex structures like [fiber bundles](@entry_id:154670), even the Künneth theorem is insufficient. A **[fiber bundle](@entry_id:153776)** is a map $p: E \to B$ where the total space $E$ locally looks like a product of the base space $B$ and a fiber $F$. The primary tool for computing the homology of $E$ from that of $B$ and $F$ is the **Serre spectral sequence**.

This is a sequence of "pages" $E^r_{p,q}$, each equipped with a differential $d_r: E^r_{p,q} \to E^r_{p-r, q+r-1}$. The sequence starts at the $E^2$ page, where $E^2_{p,q} \cong H_p(B; H_q(F))$, the homology of the base with coefficients in the homology of the fiber. The $(r+1)$-th page is the homology of the $r$-th page: $E^{r+1} = H(E^r, d_r)$. Under favorable conditions, the sequence **collapses**, meaning the differentials become zero for $r \ge 2$. In this case, the homology of the total space $E$ can be read off the $E^2$ page. Specifically, $H_n(E)$ is built from the groups $E^\infty_{p,q} = E^2_{p,q}$ where $p+q=n$.

A classic example is the fibration $SU(2) \to SU(3) \to S^5$ [@problem_id:969121]. Here, the base is $B=S^5$ and the fiber is $F=SU(2) \cong S^3$. The homology of the fiber is $H_q(S^3) = \mathbb{Z}$ for $q=0,3$ and 0 otherwise. The homology of the base is $H_p(S^5) = \mathbb{Z}$ for $p=0,5$ and 0 otherwise. The $E^2$ page is $E^2_{p,q} = H_p(S^5; H_q(S^3))$. Since $H_q(S^3)$ is always a free [abelian group](@entry_id:139381), there are no coefficient system issues. The only non-zero entries on the $E^2$ page are:
*   $E^2_{0,0} = H_0(S^5; H_0(S^3)) = H_0(S^5; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}$
*   $E^2_{5,0} = H_5(S^5; H_0(S^3)) = H_5(S^5; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}$
*   $E^2_{0,3} = H_0(S^5; H_3(S^3)) = H_0(S^5; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}$
*   $E^2_{5,3} = H_5(S^5; H_3(S^3)) = H_5(S^5; \mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}$

All [differentials](@entry_id:158422) $d_r$ for $r \ge 2$ must be zero, as they map from one of these four non-zero groups to a location where the group is zero. Thus, the spectral sequence collapses at the $E^2$ page. The homology groups of $SU(3)$ are then the direct sum of the terms on the anti-diagonals:
*   $H_0(SU(3)) \cong E^\infty_{0,0} \cong \mathbb{Z}$
*   $H_3(SU(3)) \cong E^\infty_{0,3} \cong \mathbb{Z}$
*   $H_5(SU(3)) \cong E^\infty_{5,0} \cong \mathbb{Z}$
*   $H_8(SU(3)) \cong E^\infty_{5,3} \cong \mathbb{Z}$
All other homology groups are zero. The Betti numbers are $b_0=b_3=b_5=b_8=1$, and the sum of the Betti numbers is 4.

#### Connections to Group Theory and Surgery Theory

Homology theory extends far beyond pure topology. The homology of an **Eilenberg-MacLane space** $K(G, 1)$ is by definition the **[group homology](@entry_id:159702)** of the group $G$. This provides a deep link between topology and algebra. For instance, computing $H_3(K(\mathbb{Z}_p \times \mathbb{Z}_p, 1); \mathbb{Z})$ is equivalent to computing the [group homology](@entry_id:159702) $H_3(\mathbb{Z}_p \times \mathbb{Z}_p; \mathbb{Z})$, a purely algebraic task that can be accomplished using a Künneth theorem for [group homology](@entry_id:159702) [@problem_id:969017].

Furthermore, homology groups are central to **[surgery theory](@entry_id:161809)**, which studies the classification of manifolds. Invariants called **surgery obstructions** live in algebraically defined groups, such as the Wall group $L_4(\mathbb{Z})$. An element of this group can be represented by a **Poincaré complex**—a [chain complex](@entry_id:150246) equipped with a structure analogous to Poincaré duality. The invariant itself is often computed from the homology of this complex. For example, the surgery obstruction in $L_4(\mathbb{Z}) \cong \mathbb{Z}$ for a given 4-dimensional Poincaré complex is the signature of a [symmetric bilinear form](@entry_id:148281) induced on its second homology group, $H_2(C)$ [@problem_id:969003]. This demonstrates that homology groups do more than just count holes; they serve as the carriers for refined algebraic structures that contain profound geometric information.
