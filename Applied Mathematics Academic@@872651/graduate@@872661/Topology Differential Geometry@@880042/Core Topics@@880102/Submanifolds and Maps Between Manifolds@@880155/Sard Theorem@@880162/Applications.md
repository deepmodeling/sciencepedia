## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

Having established the principles and mechanisms of Sard's theorem in the previous chapter, we now turn our attention to its applications. The statement of the theorem—that the set of critical values of a [smooth map](@entry_id:160364) has measure zero—may seem abstract, but its consequences are remarkably concrete and far-reaching. This chapter explores how this single idea provides profound insights and powerful tools across diverse areas of mathematics, from the intuitive [geometry of surfaces](@entry_id:271794) to the foundations of algebraic topology, geometric analysis, and even [mathematical physics](@entry_id:265403). We will see that the "scarcity" of critical values is not merely a technical curiosity but a fundamental structural property of the mathematical universe, enabling us to prove deep theorems and construct sophisticated theories by assuring that "generic" cases are always well-behaved.

### Geometric Visualization and Morse Theory

The most direct application of Sard's theorem lies in understanding the geometry of [smooth functions](@entry_id:138942) on familiar surfaces. By identifying the [critical points](@entry_id:144653) and values of a function, we can capture its most significant topological features. A classic and intuitive example is the analysis of a projection function, such as the [height function](@entry_id:271993), on a manifold.

Consider a standard torus of revolution in $\mathbb{R}^3$, defined by a major radius $R$ and minor radius $r$. Let us analyze the projection onto one of its symmetry axes, say the $x$-axis, given by the function $p(x, y, z) = x$. The critical points of this function restricted to the torus are those points where the [tangent plane](@entry_id:136914) is vertical (i.e., orthogonal to the $x$-axis). A direct calculation reveals that there are exactly four such points, all located on the torus's equator in the $z=0$ plane: $(\pm(R+r), 0, 0)$ and $(\pm(R-r), 0, 0)$. The images of these four critical points under the projection map yield the set of four critical values: $\{R+r, R-r, -(R-r), -(R+r)\}$. As Sard's theorem predicts, this is a finite set and thus has measure zero in $\mathbb{R}$ [@problem_id:1660381]. For any value $c$ between these critical values, the level set $p^{-1}(c)$ on the torus consists of one or two smooth circles.

This idea extends naturally to more complex functions, such as the potential energy of a physical system. For instance, we can consider the function representing the squared Euclidean distance from a fixed external point $P_0$ to any point on the torus. The [critical points](@entry_id:144653) of this function correspond to equilibrium positions in the gravitational field generated by $P_0$. Again, these occur at a finite number of points, corresponding to the closest, farthest, and saddle-type [equilibrium points](@entry_id:167503) on the torus surface. The set of critical values, which represent the squared distances at these equilibria, is therefore a [finite set](@entry_id:152247), in full agreement with Sard's theorem [@problem_id:1020177]. This [connection forms](@entry_id:263247) the bedrock of Morse theory, which relates the number of critical points of a function to the topology of the underlying manifold.

Sard's theorem retains its power when mapping to higher-dimensional spaces. Consider a map $F$ from the unit sphere $S^2 \subset \mathbb{R}^3$ to the plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ defined by $F(x, y, z) = (x^2 + y^2, z)$. In this case, a careful analysis of the differential shows that *every* point on the sphere is a critical point. This might initially seem to contradict the spirit of Sard's theorem, which suggests that critical phenomena are rare. However, the theorem concerns critical *values*, not critical *points*. The image of the entire sphere under this map traces out a simple parabolic arc in the target plane $\mathbb{R}^2$, defined by the curve $u = 1-v^2$ for $v \in [-1, 1]$. This curve, while containing the image of infinitely many [critical points](@entry_id:144653), is a one-dimensional object within a two-dimensional space and thus has Lebesgue measure zero [@problem_id:1020156]. This example beautifully illustrates the subtlety of the theorem: the set of critical points can be large, but their image in the [target space](@entry_id:143180) is always sparse.

### Structure of Manifolds and Mappings

Beyond providing geometric intuition, Sard's theorem is a fundamental tool for proving structural theorems about manifolds and the maps between them. Its most immediate and significant consequence is the Regular Value Theorem.

Since the set of critical values of a [smooth map](@entry_id:160364) $f: M \to N$ has [measure zero](@entry_id:137864), almost every point in the target manifold $N$ is a [regular value](@entry_id:188218). The Regular Value Theorem states that the [preimage](@entry_id:150899) of any [regular value](@entry_id:188218) is a neatly [embedded submanifold](@entry_id:273162) of the domain $M$. Combining these two facts leads to a powerful conclusion: for a [smooth function](@entry_id:158037) $f: M \to \mathbb{R}$, the level set $f^{-1}(c)$ is a smooth embedded hypersurface for almost every $c \in \mathbb{R}$ [@problem_id:2990347]. This formalizes our intuition from the torus example, where the [level sets](@entry_id:151155) of the [height function](@entry_id:271993) were smooth circles for all height values except the four critical ones.

This principle is instrumental in proofs concerning [embeddings](@entry_id:158103) and projections. For example, a key step in the proof of the Whitney Embedding Theorem involves showing that any $n$-dimensional manifold $M^n$ can be embedded in $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$. A common strategy is to first embed $M$ in a high-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^N$ (with $N  2n$) and then show that a "generic" linear projection onto $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ is also an embedding. A projection fails to be an embedding if it is not injective or if its differential is not injective. Sard's theorem is used to show that the set of "bad" projections—those that cause self-intersections or create singular points—is a [set of measure zero](@entry_id:198215) within the space of all possible linear projections (a Grassmannian manifold). The proof involves constructing an auxiliary map whose critical values correspond to these bad projections, and then invoking Sard's theorem to guarantee that "good" projections are abundant [@problem_id:1689801].

Sard's theorem is also the cornerstone of [singularity theory](@entry_id:160612), which studies the structure of maps near their critical points. For a map $\pi: M \to N$, the set of critical values in $N$ is known as the bifurcation set or [caustic](@entry_id:164959) set. This set comprises the parameter values in the target space where the qualitative nature of the map's preimages (or fibers) changes. Catastrophe theory, a branch of [singularity theory](@entry_id:160612), classifies the stable types of singularities that can occur. A classic example is the swallowtail catastrophe, whose equilibrium surface is defined by the equation $x^3+ux+v=0$. Projecting this surface onto the $(u,v)$-[parameter plane](@entry_id:195289), the critical values form a curve given by $4u^3+27v^2=0$. This curve, which features a characteristic cusp at the origin, has [measure zero](@entry_id:137864) in the plane, as guaranteed by Sard's theorem. It marks the boundary where the number of real solutions for $x$ changes from one to three [@problem_id:1020198].

### Applications in Algebraic and Geometric Topology

The influence of Sard's theorem extends deep into algebraic and [geometric topology](@entry_id:149613), where it is used to prove foundational results about the classification of spaces and maps.

One of the most celebrated applications is in the computation of homotopy groups of spheres. A fundamental result states that for $k  n$, the $k$-th homotopy group of the $n$-sphere, $\pi_k(S^n)$, is trivial. This means any [continuous map](@entry_id:153772) $f: S^k \to S^n$ can be continuously deformed to a constant map. The proof hinges on a crucial first step enabled by Sard's theorem. Any continuous map can be approximated by a [smooth map](@entry_id:160364). For a [smooth map](@entry_id:160364) $g: S^k \to S^n$ with $k  n$, the dimension of the domain is less than the dimension of the [codomain](@entry_id:139336). Sard's theorem implies that the image of $g$ must have [measure zero](@entry_id:137864) in $S^n$. A set of measure zero cannot be the entire manifold $S^n$, so the map $g$ cannot be surjective. This means there is at least one point $p \in S^n$ that is not in the image of $g$. The space $S^n \setminus \{p\}$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$, which is contractible. Since the image of $g$ lies in this contractible space, $g$ can be continuously shrunk to a single point. Thus, $g$, and by extension the original map $f$, is [nullhomotopic](@entry_id:148739) [@problem_id:1656849].

A far-reaching generalization of this "general position" argument is encapsulated in Thom's Transversality Theorem. Transversality is a condition on how a map's image intersects a [submanifold](@entry_id:262388), generalizing the notion of a [regular value](@entry_id:188218). The theorem states that for any [smooth map](@entry_id:160364) $f: M \to N$ and any submanifold $S \subset N$, $f$ can be arbitrarily well-approximated by a map $g$ that is transverse to $S$. The set of such transverse maps is open and dense in the space of all [smooth maps](@entry_id:203730). The proof is a sophisticated application of Sard's theorem to a parameterized family of maps, demonstrating that non-transverse maps are "rare" in an infinite-dimensional sense [@problem_id:2980337]. This theorem is a workhorse of modern [differential topology](@entry_id:157662), essential for defining intersection numbers, [cobordism theory](@entry_id:161995), and many other [geometric invariants](@entry_id:178611).

The concepts of critical points and values are also central to the study of Lie groups and their representation spaces (character varieties), which are often manifolds themselves. On the Lie group $O(2)$ of $2 \times 2$ [orthogonal matrices](@entry_id:153086), one can study a simple function like $f(A)=A_{11}$. The [critical points](@entry_id:144653) turn out to be the [diagonal matrices](@entry_id:149228), and the critical values are simply $\{-1, 1\}$ [@problem_id:1020200]. More complex examples arise in [geometric group theory](@entry_id:142584). The map $f(x,y) = (x+y, xy)$ is fundamental in algebra, relating the roots of a polynomial to its coefficients. This map can be viewed as a projection from $\mathbb{R}^2$ to the space of quadratic polynomials. Its critical points occur on the line $x=y$, and the critical values form the parabola $v = u^2/4$, which partitions the plane into regions corresponding to real and [complex roots](@entry_id:172941) [@problem_id:1020241]. This structure appears in the study of character varieties, such as the space of $SU(2)$ representations of a free group, where the domain of interest is a region bounded by an algebraic surface, and critical points can occur both in the interior and on the boundary [@problem_id:1020184].

### Frontiers in Geometric Analysis and Mathematical Physics

Sard's theorem and its generalizations are indispensable tools in modern [geometric analysis](@entry_id:157700) and [mathematical physics](@entry_id:265403), where one often works with infinite-dimensional spaces of functions or fields.

In Riemannian geometry, understanding the global structure of a manifold often involves studying geodesics emanating from a point $p$. The exponential map $\exp_p: T_pM \to M$ sends a [tangent vector](@entry_id:264836) $v$ to the point reached by following the geodesic with initial velocity $v$ for unit time. The critical points of this map give rise to [conjugate points](@entry_id:160335) in $M$. The set of all such conjugate points forms the conjugate locus, $\mathrm{Conj}(p)$. By Sard's theorem, the conjugate locus has measure zero in $M$. This fact is a crucial ingredient in proving that the [cut locus](@entry_id:161337)—the set of points where [minimizing geodesics](@entry_id:637576) cease to be unique—also has [measure zero](@entry_id:137864). This measure-zero property is essential for using [polar coordinates](@entry_id:159425) and for integrating geometric quantities over the manifold, forming a key technical step in the proof of fundamental results like the Bishop-Gromov volume [comparison theorem](@entry_id:637672) [@problem_id:2992973].

In [symplectic geometry](@entry_id:160783), Lagrangian Floer homology is a powerful invariant constructed by "counting" [pseudo-holomorphic strips](@entry_id:162091) connecting two Lagrangian [submanifolds](@entry_id:159439). For this counting to be well-defined, the [moduli space](@entry_id:161715) of such strips must be a smooth manifold of the expected dimension. This property, known as [transversality](@entry_id:158669), is typically not satisfied for an arbitrary choice of geometric data. The solution is to apply the Sard-Smale theorem, an infinite-dimensional generalization of Sard's theorem. One considers a universal moduli space that includes the space of all possible auxiliary data (specifically, time-dependent almost complex structures). The Sard-Smale theorem then guarantees that for a "generic" (i.e., residual) set of choices for this auxiliary data, the corresponding [moduli spaces](@entry_id:159780) are well-behaved, allowing the Floer homology groups to be rigorously defined [@problem_id:3031685].

Finally, these ideas find direct application in [topological quantum field theory](@entry_id:142425) (TQFT). In Chern-Simons theory, the classical solutions, or critical points of the [action functional](@entry_id:169216), are flat connections on a [3-manifold](@entry_id:193484). The value of the Chern-Simons functional at these critical points yields topological invariants. For a lens space $L(p,1)$, the [moduli space](@entry_id:161715) of flat $SU(2)$ connections is a [discrete set](@entry_id:146023) of points, each corresponding to a critical value of the functional. These values are rational numbers determined by the arithmetic of $p$, linking sophisticated geometry to number theory [@problem_id:1020130].

### Conclusion

The journey from a simple observation about the [height function](@entry_id:271993) on a torus to the foundations of Floer homology and TQFT illustrates the remarkable power and unifying nature of Sard's theorem. The simple principle that critical values are rare provides the key to unlocking deep structural properties of manifolds, proving the existence of "generic" well-behaved maps and configurations, and constructing some of the most profound invariants in modern mathematics. It is a testament to how a single, elegant idea in [differential topology](@entry_id:157662) can ripple outwards, providing essential tools and foundational support for a vast landscape of geometric and physical theories.
