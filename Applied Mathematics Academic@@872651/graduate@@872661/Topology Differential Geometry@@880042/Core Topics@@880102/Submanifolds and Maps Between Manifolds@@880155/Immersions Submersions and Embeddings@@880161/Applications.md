## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

Having established the foundational principles of immersions, [submersions](@entry_id:159709), and embeddings in the preceding chapter, we now turn our attention to the application of these concepts in diverse mathematical and scientific contexts. The true power of these differential geometric tools is revealed not in their abstract definitions, but in their capacity to define, classify, and analyze complex structures across various fields. This chapter will demonstrate how the rank conditions on the [differential of a map](@entry_id:269524) serve as a powerful lens through which to view problems in algebraic and Riemannian geometry, Lie theory, and the geometric formulations of physics. Our goal is not to reiterate core principles, but to illuminate their utility and build connections between [differential topology](@entry_id:157662) and other disciplines.

### Defining Manifolds and Their Tangent Geometries

One of the most immediate and powerful applications of [submersions](@entry_id:159709) is the rigorous construction of smooth manifolds through the Preimage Theorem. This theorem states that for a [smooth map](@entry_id:160364) $F: M \to N$, the preimage $F^{-1}(q)$ of a [regular value](@entry_id:188218) $q \in N$ is a smooth [submanifold](@entry_id:262388) of $M$. This provides a versatile method for defining manifolds implicitly via systems of equations.

A crucial first step in applying this theorem is to identify where a map fails to be a [submersion](@entry_id:161795)—that is, to find its critical points. At a critical point $p$, the differential $dF_p$ is not surjective, and the Preimage Theorem does not apply. The set of critical points often corresponds to locations of geometric or [topological change](@entry_id:174432). For instance, consider a [smooth map](@entry_id:160364) $F: \mathbb{R}^3 \to \mathbb{R}^2$. To determine if a point, such as the origin, is a critical point, one must compute the Jacobian matrix of $F$ at that point and check if its rank is less than the dimension of the codomain, which is 2. This typically involves solving a system of equations derived from the condition that the rows of the Jacobian matrix are linearly dependent. Such calculations are fundamental in analyzing the structure of the fibers of the map [@problem_id:972632].

When a point is a [regular value](@entry_id:188218), the Preimage Theorem guarantees that its fiber is a smooth submanifold. A common scenario is the definition of a manifold as the intersection of several [hypersurfaces](@entry_id:159491) in an [ambient space](@entry_id:184743) like $\mathbb{R}^n$. For example, a curve in $\mathbb{R}^4$ can be defined as the common zero set of three functions $F_1, F_2, F_3$. This can be framed as finding the fiber over $(0,0,0)$ for the map $F = (F_1, F_2, F_3): \mathbb{R}^4 \to \mathbb{R}^3$. The tangent space to this curve at a point $p$ is precisely the kernel of the differential $dF_p$. This means any [tangent vector](@entry_id:264836) $v$ to the curve must be orthogonal to the gradient vectors of each defining function at $p$, i.e., $\nabla F_i(p) \cdot v = 0$ for $i=1, 2, 3$. This provides a direct algebraic method for computing the tangent space of implicitly defined manifolds [@problem_id:972660].

The fibers obtained via [submersions](@entry_id:159709) are not merely topological curiosities; they are concrete geometric objects possessing their own intrinsic and extrinsic properties. Consider a submersion from $\mathbb{R}^3$ to $\mathbb{R}^2$, whose fibers are one-dimensional submanifolds, i.e., smooth curves. One can investigate the geometry of these curves, for example, by calculating their curvature. This requires parameterizing the curve, often through [implicit differentiation](@entry_id:137929) of the defining equations of the fiber, to find the first and second derivatives needed for the standard curvature formula $\kappa = \frac{\|\gamma' \times \gamma''\|}{\|\gamma'\|^3}$. Such an analysis directly connects the abstract concept of a [submersion](@entry_id:161795) to the classical [differential geometry of curves](@entry_id:273073) [@problem_id:972651].

This perspective extends to the study of [geometric analysis](@entry_id:157700) on implicitly defined manifolds. For example, the function $f(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) = x_1^2 + x_2^2$ defines a submersion from the 3-sphere $S^3 \subset \mathbb{R}^4$ to $\mathbb{R}$. For a [regular value](@entry_id:188218) $c \in (0,1)$, the level set $f^{-1}(c)$ is a 2-dimensional [submanifold](@entry_id:262388) of $S^3$ known as a Clifford torus. Once this surface is defined, one can study its geometry in detail. By parameterizing the torus, one can compute the [induced metric](@entry_id:160616), the [mean curvature vector](@entry_id:199617), and integrate quantities over the surface, such as the Willmore energy, which is of great interest in [mathematical physics](@entry_id:265403) and biology [@problem_id:972572]. The concept of level sets is also ubiquitous in vector calculus, where the [gradient vector](@entry_id:141180) $\nabla f$ is known to be normal to the [level surfaces](@entry_id:196027) of a function $f$. This principle allows for the computation of geometric properties such as the angle between two intersecting surfaces, defined as the angle between their normal (gradient) vectors at the point of intersection [@problem_id:972720].

### Realizing Geometries through Immersions and Embeddings

While [submersions](@entry_id:159709) are used to deconstruct manifolds into fibers, immersions and embeddings are used to construct and represent manifolds within larger ambient spaces. An embedding provides a faithful representation of a manifold as a [submanifold](@entry_id:262388) of another, preserving all topological and differential properties.

A primary step in analyzing a parameterized map $f: M \to N$ is determining where it fails to be an immersion. These are points where the differential $df_p$ is not injective, causing the map to "crush" or "fold" tangent vectors. For a map from $\mathbb{R}^2$ to $\mathbb{R}^3$, for instance, this occurs where the two columns of the Jacobian matrix become linearly dependent. Locating these singular points is essential for understanding the geometry of the map's image [@problem_id:972730].

In complex and algebraic geometry, embeddings are indispensable tools for studying abstract spaces by placing them into well-understood ambient spaces like [complex projective space](@entry_id:268402) $\mathbb{CP}^n$. The Veronese embedding, for example, maps the [complex projective line](@entry_id:276948) $\mathbb{CP}^1$ holomorphically into $\mathbb{CP}^2$. The image, a complex submanifold known as the Veronese surface, has fascinating extrinsic geometric properties. For instance, it is a minimal surface in $\mathbb{CP}^2$ (with respect to the Fubini-Study metric), and its principal curvatures can be calculated, providing deep insight into its geometry as a submanifold [@problem_id:972595]. Similarly, the Segre embedding provides a canonical way to embed the product of [projective spaces](@entry_id:157963), such as $\mathbb{CP}^1 \times \mathbb{CP}^1$, into a larger [projective space](@entry_id:149949), $\mathbb{CP}^3$. The image of this embedding is an algebraic variety whose geometric properties, such as its total volume with respect to the induced Fubini-Study metric, can then be computed using the tools of Kähler geometry [@problem_id:972596].

Beyond these classical constructions, [embeddings](@entry_id:158103) arise in more abstract and foundational contexts. A canonical example is the 1-jet extension of a smooth function $f: M \to \mathbb{R}$. This map, $\Phi_f: M \to J^1(M, \mathbb{R})$, sends a point $p \in M$ to a triplet consisting of the point itself, the value of the function $f(p)$, and its differential $df_p$. This map is always an embedding, providing a canonical way to realize any smooth manifold $M$ as a closed submanifold of its 1-[jet bundle](@entry_id:158903). This construction is fundamental in the geometric theory of [partial differential equations](@entry_id:143134) and calculus of variations, where the [jet bundle](@entry_id:158903) provides the natural setting to study differential equations as geometric objects [@problem_id:1662631].

Finally, it is crucial to appreciate the subtle but important distinction between an immersion and an embedding. An immersion need not be a [homeomorphism](@entry_id:146933) onto its image. A classic example is the "irrational winding" of the real line $\mathbb{R}$ onto a 2-torus $T^2$, given by $t \mapsto (\exp(2\pi i t), \exp(2\pi i \alpha t))$ for irrational $\alpha$. This map is an injective immersion, but its image is a [dense subset](@entry_id:150508) of the torus, and its topology is drastically different from that of $\mathbb{R}$. Consequently, it is not an embedding. This distinction has important theoretical consequences; for instance, a map $f: M \to N$ is an embedding if and only if its [induced map](@entry_id:271712) on the tangent bundles, $df: TM \to TN$, is also an embedding. For the irrational line, since the original map is not an embedding, its differential lift is also an immersion but not an embedding [@problem_id:1636903].

### Riemannian Submersions and the Geometry of Fiber Bundles

The concept of a [submersion](@entry_id:161795) takes on special significance in Riemannian geometry. A Riemannian [submersion](@entry_id:161795) is a [submersion](@entry_id:161795) $\pi: M \to B$ between Riemannian manifolds that preserves the lengths of horizontal vectors. This structure provides a powerful framework for constructing new metrics and relating the curvatures of the total space $M$, the base space $B$, and the fibers.

The archetypal examples are the Hopf [fibrations](@entry_id:156331). The fibration $\pi: S^3 \to S^2$ presents the 3-sphere as a circle bundle over the 2-sphere. This is a Riemannian submersion when $S^3$ and $S^2$ are equipped with their standard round metrics. The geometry of such a submersion is encoded by the O'Neill tensor $A$, which measures the failure of the [horizontal distribution](@entry_id:196663) to be integrable. For two horizontal vector fields $X, Y$, the tensor $A_X Y$ is the vertical part of their Lie bracket (or, equivalently, of the covariant derivative $\nabla_X Y$). Its norm $|A|^2$ is a key geometric invariant that appears in O'Neill's formula relating the curvatures of the spaces. For the $S^3 \to S^2$ [fibration](@entry_id:162085), the squared norm of the O'Neill tensor is constant and can be shown to be directly proportional to the [sectional curvature](@entry_id:159738) of the total space $S^3$ [@problem_id:972734].

O'Neill's formula for the sectional curvature of the base space is $K_B(X, Y) = K_M(\bar{X}, \bar{Y}) + \frac{3}{4} \|[\bar{X}, \bar{Y}]^V\|^2$, where $\bar{X}, \bar{Y}$ are horizontal lifts and the second term involves the O'Neill tensor. This formula is a powerful computational tool. For example, the [complex projective plane](@entry_id:262661) $\mathbb{CP}^2$ can be realized as the base space of the Riemannian [submersion](@entry_id:161795) $\pi: S^5 \to \mathbb{CP}^2$. The sphere $S^5$ has a simple, [constant sectional curvature](@entry_id:272200). By calculating the O'Neill tensor for this fibration, one can use the formula to compute the sectional curvatures and, consequently, the [scalar curvature](@entry_id:157547) of the much more complicated space $\mathbb{CP}^2$ [@problem_id:972654].

This framework extends naturally to Lie groups and [homogeneous spaces](@entry_id:271488). For example, the sphere $S^2$ can be realized as the [homogeneous space](@entry_id:159636) $SO(3)/SO(2)$. The projection map $\pi: SO(3) \to S^2$ is a Riemannian submersion when $SO(3)$ is equipped with a [bi-invariant metric](@entry_id:184842). The vertical space at the identity corresponds to the Lie algebra of $SO(2)$, and the horizontal space is its [orthogonal complement](@entry_id:151540). The O'Neill tensor can be computed directly from the Lie algebra structure, as the Levi-Civita connection on a Lie group with a [bi-invariant metric](@entry_id:184842) has a simple expression in terms of the Lie bracket: $\nabla_X Y = \frac{1}{2}[X,Y]$. This connects the [differential geometry](@entry_id:145818) of [submersions](@entry_id:159709) directly to the algebraic structure of Lie theory [@problem_id:972667].

### Interaction with Symplectic and Contact Structures

Immersions and embeddings play a central role when a manifold is endowed with additional geometric structures, such as a symplectic or contact form. The properties of an [embedded submanifold](@entry_id:273162) are deeply influenced by its interaction with these external structures.

In symplectic geometry, the ambient space is a manifold $\mathcal{M}^{2n}$ equipped with a closed, non-degenerate 2-form $\omega$, the [symplectic form](@entry_id:161619). Of particular interest are Lagrangian submanifolds: $n$-dimensional [submanifolds](@entry_id:159439) $L \subset \mathcal{M}$ on which the symplectic form vanishes when pulled back. That is, if $f: L \to \mathcal{M}$ is the inclusion map, then $f^*\omega = 0$. This condition imposes strong constraints on the geometry of the [submanifold](@entry_id:262388). Determining whether a given immersed surface, such as a torus in $\mathbb{R}^4$ with its standard symplectic form $\omega = dx_1 \wedge dy_1 + dx_2 \wedge dy_2$, is Lagrangian involves parameterizing the surface and explicitly computing the [pullback](@entry_id:160816) of $\omega$. The condition $f^*\omega = 0$ then translates into a set of algebraic constraints on the parameters defining the immersion [@problem_id:972735]. Lagrangian [submanifolds](@entry_id:159439) are central objects in classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and string theory.

In contact geometry, the [ambient space](@entry_id:184743) is a manifold $\mathcal{M}^{2n+1}$ equipped with a contact form $\alpha$, which is a 1-form such that $\alpha \wedge (d\alpha)^n$ is a [volume form](@entry_id:161784) everywhere. The contact form defines a field of [hyperplanes](@entry_id:268044) $\xi = \ker(\alpha)$ called the contact distribution. When a hypersurface $S$ is embedded in a contact manifold, its [tangent spaces](@entry_id:199137) $T_pS$ interact with the contact planes $\xi_p$. At most points, the intersection $T_pS \cap \xi_p$ is a line, defining a line field on the surface. This line field, known as the characteristic [foliation](@entry_id:160209), is a fundamental object describing the dynamics of the [contact structure](@entry_id:635649) relative to the surface. For an embedded surface in $(\mathbb{R}^3, dz - y\,dx)$, such as an [elliptic paraboloid](@entry_id:268068), the vector field generating this [foliation](@entry_id:160209) can be computed explicitly. A [tangent vector](@entry_id:264836) $V$ at a point on the surface is characteristic if it satisfies $\alpha(V) = 0$. This condition yields an equation that determines the direction of the characteristic vector field at each point [@problem_id:972745].

### Conclusion

As we have seen, the concepts of immersions, [submersions](@entry_id:159709), and [embeddings](@entry_id:158103) transcend their roles as mere definitions in [differential topology](@entry_id:157662). They are active, powerful tools that enable the construction, analysis, and interrelation of geometric objects across a vast spectrum of mathematics. From defining manifolds implicitly and calculating their curvature, to faithfully representing abstract varieties in [projective spaces](@entry_id:157963), and to understanding the rich geometry of [fiber bundles](@entry_id:154670), these concepts form the very syntax of modern geometry. Their ability to interface with other structures, such as those in Riemannian, symplectic, and contact geometry, underscores their fundamental and unifying role. The applications explored in this chapter represent only a fraction of their reach, but they serve to illustrate a profound principle: understanding the local behavior of a map through its differential unlocks a deep understanding of global geometric structure.
