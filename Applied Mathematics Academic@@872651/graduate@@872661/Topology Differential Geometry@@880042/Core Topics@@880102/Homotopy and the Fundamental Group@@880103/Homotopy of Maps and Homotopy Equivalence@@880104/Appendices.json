A key concept is the set of based homotopy classes of maps between two based topological spaces.\n\nLet $(X, x_0)$ and $(Y, y_0)$ be based topological spaces. A continuous map $f: X \\to Y$ is called a based map if $f(x_0) = y_0$. Two based maps $f, g: (X, x_0) \\to (Y, y_0)$ are based-homotopic if there exists a continuous map $H: X \\times [0,1] \\to Y$, called a based homotopy, such that $H(x,0) = f(x)$ and $H(x,1) = g(x)$ for all $x \\in X$, and $H(x_0, t) = y_0$ for all $t \\in [0,1]$. The set of based homotopy classes of maps from $(X, x_0)$ to $(Y, y_0)$ is denoted by $[X, Y]_*$.\n\nFor certain choices of $X$ and $Y$, this set $[X, Y]_*$ can be endowed with the structure of a group, which is abelian in many important cases.
