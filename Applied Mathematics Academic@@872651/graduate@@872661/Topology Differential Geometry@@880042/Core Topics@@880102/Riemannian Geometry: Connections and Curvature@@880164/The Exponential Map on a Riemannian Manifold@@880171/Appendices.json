Since $u$ is a unit vector, the speed of this geodesic is $|\\alpha'(s)| = |\\pi u| = \\pi$, which is constant but not equal to $1$. The Jacobi equation, $J'' + R(J, \\gamma')\\gamma' = 0$, is most conveniently expressed for an arc-length parameterized geodesic $\\gamma$. Let us re-parameterize $\\alpha(s)$ to an arc-length geodesic $\\gamma(t)$. Let the arc-length parameter be $t$. Then $t = |\\alpha'(s)| s = \\pi s$, so $s = t/\\pi$. The arc-length parameterized geodesic is $\\gamma(t) = \\alpha(t/\\pi) = \\exp_p(tu)$ for $t \\in [0, \\pi]$. Let $\\tilde{J}(t)$ be the Jacobi field along $\\gamma(t)$ corresponding to $J(s)$ along $\\alpha(s)$, i.e., $\\tilde{J}(t) = J(s) = J(t/\\pi)$. We need to transform the initial conditions and the Jacobi equation.\n\nThe covariant derivative with respect to $s$ is $\\nabla_s = \\nabla_{\\alpha'(s)}$, and with respect to $t$ is $\\nabla_t = \\nabla_{\\gamma'(t)}$. Since $\\alpha'(s) = \\pi \\gamma'(t)$, we have $\\nabla_s = \\pi \\nabla_t$.\nThe first derivative of $J$ is $J'(s) = \\nabla_s J(s) = \\pi \\nabla_t \\tilde{J}(t)$.\nThe second derivative is $J''(s) = \\nabla_s(\\pi \\nabla_t \\tilde{J}(t)) = \\pi^2 \\nabla_t(\\nabla_t \\tilde{J}(t)) = \\pi^2 \\tilde{J}''(t)$.\nThe Jacobi equation for $J(s)$ is $J'' + R(J, \\alpha')\\alpha' = 0$.

Let $w' = w/\\pi$.\n$w' = w'_{\\parallel} + w'_{\\perp}$, where $w'_{\\parallel} = \\langle w', u \\rangle u$ and $w'_{\\perp} = w' - w'_{\\parallel}$.\nBy linearity, the Jacobi field $\\tilde{J}(t)$ is the sum of the Jacobi fields corresponding to these two components: $\\tilde{J}(t) = \\tilde{J}_{\\parallel}(t) + \\tilde{J}_{\\perp}(t)$.\n\nCase 1: Tangential component $w'_{\\parallel}$.\nThe Jacobi field evolves along the geodesic $\\gamma(t)$. Let $U(t) = \\gamma'(t)$ be the tangent vector field. $U(0)=u$. A Jacobi field that is always tangential to the geodesic is of the form $\\tilde{J}_{\\parallel}(t) = f(t)U(t)$. The Jacobi equation for such a field on any Riemannian manifold is $\\tilde{J}_{\\parallel}''(t)=0$.\nThe solution is $\\tilde{J}_{\\parallel}(t) = (At+B)U(t)$ (here, $U(t)$ is parallel-transported, so its covariant derivative is zero).\nInitial conditions:\n$\\tilde{J}_{\\parallel}(0) = f(0)U(0)=0 \\implies f(0)=0 \\implies B=0$.\n$\\tilde{J}_{\\parallel}'(0) = f'(0)U(0) = w'_{\\parallel} = \\langle w', u \\rangle u$. Since $U(0)=u$, we have $f'(0) = \\langle w', u \\rangle = \\frac{\\langle w, u \\rangle}{\\pi}$.\nFrom $f(t)=At$, we have $f'(t)=A$, so $A = \\frac{\\langle w, u \\rangle}{\\pi}$.\nThus, the tangential Jacobi field is $\\tilde{J}_{\\parallel}(t) = \\frac{\\langle w, u \\rangle}{\\pi} t U(t)$.\nWe evaluate this at $t=\\pi$:\n$\\tilde{J}_{\\parallel}(\\pi) = \\frac{\\langle w, u \\rangle}{\\pi} \\pi U(\\pi) = \\langle w, u \\rangle U(\\pi)$.\n\nCase 2: Normal component $w'_{\\perp}$.\nLet $\\tilde{J}_{\\perp}(t)$ be the Jacobi field with initial conditions $\\tilde{J}_{\\perp}(0)=0$ and $\\tilde{J}_{\\perp}'(0) = w'_{\\perp}$. Since $\\langle w'_{\\perp}, u \\rangle=0$, the Jacobi field $\\tilde{J}_{\\perp}(t)$ will be normal to $\\gamma(t)$ for all $t$, i.e., $\\langle \\tilde{J}_{\\perp}(t), U(t) \\rangle = 0$.\nThe Jacobi equation is $\\tilde{J}_{\\perp}'' + R(\\tilde{J}_{\\perp}, U)U = 0$.\nFor a manifold of constant sectional curvature $1$, the curvature tensor is $R(X,Y)Z = \\langle Y,Z \\rangle X - \\langle X,Z \\rangle Y$.\n$R(\\tilde{J}_{\\perp}, U)U = \\langle U,U \\rangle \\tilde{J}_{\\perp} - \\langle \\tilde{J}_{\\perp},U \\rangle U$.\nSince $U$ is a unit vector field and $\\tilde{J}_{\\perp}$ is normal to $U$, we have $\\langle U,U \\rangle = 1$ and $\\langle \\tilde{J}_{\\perp},U \\rangle = 0$.\nThe curvature term simplifies to $R(\\tilde{J}_{\\perp}, U)U = \\tilde{J}_{\\perp}$.\nThe Jacobi equation for normal fields becomes $\\tilde{J}_{\\perp}'' + \\tilde{J}_{\\perp} = 0$.\nLet $W'_{\\perp}(t)$ be the vector field obtained by parallel transporting $w'_{\\perp}$ along $\\gamma(t)$. Then the solution can be written as $\\tilde{J}_{\\perp}(t) = (\\cos(t)) A + (\\sin(t)) B$, where $A$ and $B$ are parallel vector fields determined by the initial conditions.\n$\\tilde{J}_{\\perp}(0)=0 \\implies A=0$.\n$\\tilde{J}_{\\perp}'(0)=w'_{\\perp} \\implies B=w'_{\\perp}$.\nSo, $\\tilde{J}_{\\perp}(t) = \\sin(t) W'_{\\perp}(t)$.\nWe evaluate this at $t=\\pi$:\n$\\tilde{J}_{\\perp}(\\pi) = \\sin(\\pi) W'_{\\perp}(\\pi) = 0 \\cdot W'_{\\perp}(\\pi) = 0$.\n\nCombining the results:\nThe total result for the differential is $d(\\exp_p)_{\\pi u}(w) = \\tilde{J}(\\pi) = \\tilde{J}_{\\parallel}(\\pi) + \\tilde{J}_{\\perp}(\\pi) = \\langle w, u \\rangle U(\\pi) + 0 = \\langle w, u \\rangle U(\\pi)$.\nWe are seeking the kernel of this map, which is the set of all $w \\in T_pS^n$ such that $d(\\exp_p)_{\\pi u}(w)=0$.\n$\\langle w, u \\rangle U(\\pi) = 0$.\nThe vector $U(\\pi) = \\gamma'(\\pi)$ is a tangent vector at the point $\\exp_p(\\pi u)$, which is the point antipodal to $p$. This is a non-zero vector. Therefore, for the expression to be zero, the scalar coefficient must be zero:\n$\\langle w, u \\rangle = 0$.\nThis is the condition defining the orthogonal complement of $u$ in $T_pS^n$, denoted as $u^{\\perp}$.\nSo, the kernel of $d(\\exp_p)_{\\pi u}$ is precisely the subspace $u^{\\perp} \\subset T_pS^n$.\n\nThe space $T_pS^n$ is an $n$-dimensional vector space. The vector $u$ is a non-zero vector in this space. The subspace $u^{\\perp}$ consists of all vectors orthogonal to $u$. The dimension of this subspace is $\\dim(T_pS^n) - 1 = n-1$.\n\nTherefore, the dimension of the kernel of $d(\\exp_{p})_{\\pi u}$ is $n-1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{n-1}$$", "id": "3035049"}]}
