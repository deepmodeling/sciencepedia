A metric space is complete if and only if every Cauchy sequence in that space converges to a limit that is also within the space.\n\nLet's test this definition for the space of polynomials $(P, d_\\infty)$. To show that $(P, d_\\infty)$ is *not* complete, we need to construct a counterexample: a sequence of polynomials $\\{p_n\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ where each $p_n \\in P$, such that $\\{p_n\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence with respect to the metric $d_\\infty$, but its limit is a function $f \\in C[0, 1]$ that is not a polynomial (i.e., $f \\notin P$).\n\nA classic way to construct such a sequence is by using the Taylor series expansion of a non-polynomial analytic function, for example, the exponential function $f(x) = \\exp(x)$. The Taylor series for $\\exp(x)$ around $x=0$ is given by $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^k}{k!}$.\n\nLet us define a sequence of polynomials $\\{p_n\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ by the partial sums of this Taylor series:\n$$p_n(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\frac{x^k}{k!}$$\nEach $p_n(x)$ is a polynomial of degree $n$, so $p_n \\in P$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nFirst, we must show that this sequence $\\{p_n\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $(P, d_\\infty)$.\nLet $m, n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ with $m  n$.

The function $g(x) = \\sum_{k=n+1}^{m} \\frac{x^k}{k!}$ is an increasing function of $x$ on $[0, 1]$, so its supremum is at $x=1$.\n$$d_\\infty(p_m, p_n) = \\sum_{k=n+1}^{m} \\frac{1^k}{k!} = \\sum_{k=n+1}^{m} \\frac{1}{k!}$$\nThe infinite series $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{k!}$ is known to converge (to the value $e$). A fundamental property of convergent series is that the sequence of their partial sums is a Cauchy sequence. Therefore, for any $\\epsilon  0$, there exists an integer $N$ such that for all $m  n  N$, the tail of the series is bounded: $\\sum_{k=n+1}^{m} \\frac{1}{k!}  \\epsilon$.\nThis implies that for any $\\epsilon  0$, there exists an $N$ such that for all $m  n  N$, $d_\\infty(p_m, p_n)  \\epsilon$. Thus, $\\{p_n\\}$ is a Cauchy sequence in $(P, d_\\infty)$.\n\nNext, we identify the limit of this sequence. It is a well-known result from real analysis that the Taylor series for $\\exp(x)$ converges uniformly to $\\exp(x)$ on any bounded interval. Uniform convergence on $[0,1]$ is equivalent to convergence in the supremum metric $d_\\infty$.\nSo, the sequence of polynomials $\\{p_n\\}$ converges to the function $f(x) = \\exp(x)$.\n$$\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} d_\\infty(p_n, f) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\sup_{x \\in [0, 1]} \\left| \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\frac{x^k}{k!} - \\exp(x) \\right| = 0$$\nThe limit function $f(x) = \\exp(x)$ is continuous on $[0, 1]$, so $f \\in C[0, 1]$. However, $\\exp(x)$ is not a polynomial function (for instance, its derivative is never zero, whereas the higher-order derivatives of any non-constant polynomial must eventually be zero). Therefore, the limit of our Cauchy sequence, $f(x) = \\exp(x)$, is not in the set $P$.\n\nWe have found a Cauchy sequence $\\{p_n\\}$ in $(P, d_\\infty)$ that converges to a limit $f \\notin P$.

Our sequence $\\{p_n\\}$ is a prime example.\nC. Every Cauchy sequence of functions in $(P, d_\\infty)$ converges to a limit that is also a polynomial. This is the definition of completeness for the space $(P, d_\\infty)$. Since the space is not complete, this statement is false.\nD. The set $P$ is a closed subset of the metric space $(C[0, 1], d_\\infty)$. It is a theorem that a subspace of a complete metric space is complete if and only if it is closed. The space $(C[0, 1], d_\\infty)$ is known to be a complete metric space. Since its subspace $(P, d_\\infty)$ is not complete, the set $P$ cannot be a closed subset of $C[0, 1]$. In fact, our counterexample shows that $P$ is not closed, as it does not contain all of its limit points (the function $\\exp(x)$ is a limit point of $P$ but is not in $P$).
