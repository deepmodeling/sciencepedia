However, boundedness (and even closedness) does not imply sequential compactness in infinite-dimensional normed spaces. Indeed, $S$ is closed: if $(e_{n_{j}})$ converges in $l^{2}$, then it is Cauchy; taking $0\\varepsilon\\sqrt{2}$ forces $e_{n_{j}}=e_{n_{k}}$ for all $j,k$ large enough (otherwise the distance is $\\sqrt{2}$), so the sequence is eventually constant and its limit is in $S$.
