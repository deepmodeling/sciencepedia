Such a polynomial has no real roots if and only if its discriminant, $\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac$, is negative.\n\nLet $X$ be the topological space consisting of all real quadratic polynomials that have no real roots. A path component of a topological space is a maximal path-connected subset. Two points are in the same path component if and only if there exists a continuous path between them that lies entirely within the space.\n\nDetermine the number of path components of the space $X$.", "solution": "We identify quadratic polynomials $P(x)=ax^2+bx+c$ with points $(a,b,c)\\in\\mathbb{R}^3$.

Then $a>0$ and $b^2-4ac0$. We show that any such point can be connected to the reference point $(1,0,1) \\in X^+$.\n   a) Define a path from $(a,b,c)$ to $(a,0,c)$ by $\\gamma_1(t)=(a, (1-t)b, c)$ for $t\\in[0,1]$. The discriminant along this path is $\\Delta(t)=((1-t)b)^2-4ac=(1-t)^2b^2-4ac$. Since $b^24ac$ and $(1-t)^2 \\le 1$, we have $(1-t)^2b^2  4ac$. Thus, $\\Delta(t)  4ac - 4ac = 0$, so the path stays in $X^+$.\n   b) Now, starting from $(a,0,c)$ (with $a>0, -4ac0 \\implies c>0$), define a path to $(1,0,1)$ by $\\gamma_2(t)=((1-t)a+t, 0, (1-t)c+t)$ for $t\\in[0,1]$. The discriminant is $\\Delta(t) = 0^2 - 4((1-t)a+t)((1-t)c+t)$. Since $a,c,t,(1-t)$ are all non-negative (and not simultaneously zero), both factors in the product are positive. Thus $\\Delta(t)0$. The leading coefficient also remains positive.\nThus, every point of $X^+$ can be joined to $(1,0,1)$, so $X^+$ is path-connected.\n\n2. **Path-connectedness of $X^-$:** An analogous construction connects any $(a,b,c)\\in X^-$ to the reference point $(-1,0,-1)$ without leaving $X^-$.\n\nSince $X^+$ and $X^-$ are non-empty, disjoint, and each path-connected, and their union is $X$, the space $X$ has exactly two path components.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "1008964"}, {"introduction": "Building on the previous exercise, we now turn our attention to the complementary set: quadratic polynomials that possess two distinct real roots.

To show that $X_+$ is path-connected, we observe that for any fixed $a > 0$, the set of pairs $(b,c)$ satisfying $b^2 - 4ac > 0$ (or $c  b^2/(4a)$) is the region in the $bc$-plane below a parabola. This region is path-connected. Since we can also continuously vary $a > 0$ while adjusting $b$ and $c$ to maintain the inequality, the entire set $X_+$ is path-connected.

This implies that neither eigenvalue is zero.\n2. The sign of the eigenvalues is a topological invariant, as eigenvalues are continuous functions of the matrix entries. A path from a matrix with one set of eigenvalue signs to another would have to pass through a state where an eigenvalue is zero, which means $\\det(H)=0$.

These are positive-definite matrices.\n   (ii) Both eigenvalues are negative ($\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2  0$). These are negative-definite matrices.\n   (iii) The eigenvalues have opposite signs ($\\lambda_1\\lambda_2  0$). These are indefinite matrices.\n3. Each of these subsets is path-connected:\n   - (i) Any positive-definite matrix $H$ can be connected to the identity matrix $I$ via the path $H(t) = (1-t)I + tH$.

It can be continuously deformed to the reference matrix $\\mathrm{diag}(1,-1)$ by first deforming its eigenvalues along straight lines to $1$ and $-1$, and then deforming its unitary matrix of eigenvectors to the identity. These deformations do not change the signs of the eigenvalues, so the path stays within the indefinite subset.\n4. Since no continuous path can change the signature without making the determinant zero, these three subsets are distinct path components.\nTherefore, the number of topological phases is three.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "1008838"}]}
