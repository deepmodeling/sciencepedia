By examining the Lie group of invertible diagonal matrices [@problem_id:933042], we can directly apply the principle that the connected components of a product space are simply the products of the components of the individual factor spaces. This practice provides a concrete illustration of decomposing a complex space to analyze its global properties.", "problem": "Consider the Lie group $G$ consisting of all invertible $3 \\times 3$ real diagonal matrices.
