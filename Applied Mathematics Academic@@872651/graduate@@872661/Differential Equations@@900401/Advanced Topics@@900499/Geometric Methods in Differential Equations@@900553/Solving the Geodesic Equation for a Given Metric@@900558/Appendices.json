It is equivalent and simpler to find the path that extremizes the square of the path length, which is governed by the Lagrangian:\n$$L(x, y, \\dot{x}, \\dot{y}) = g_{\\mu\\nu} \\dot{x}^\\mu \\dot{x}^\\nu = \\frac{1}{y^2}(\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2),$$\nwhere the dot denotes differentiation with respect to an affine parameter $\\lambda$, i.e., $\\dot{x} = dx/d\\lambda$.\n\nWe can use the Euler-Lagrange equations, $\\frac{d}{d\\lambda}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{x}^\\mu}\\right) - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x^\\mu} = 0$, to find the equations of motion. However, it is more direct to use conservation laws arising from symmetries of the Lagrangian.\n\n1.  **Conservation of Momentum in the $x$-direction:**\n    The Lagrangian $L$ does not depend explicitly on the coordinate $x$ ($\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial x} = 0$). This translational symmetry implies the conservation of the conjugate momentum $p_x$:\n    $$p_x = \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{x}} = \\frac{2\\dot{x}}{y^2} = C,$$\n    where $C$ is a constant of motion. From this, we can express $\\dot{x}$ as:\n    $$\\dot{x} = \\frac{C}{2}y^2.$$\n\n2.  **Conservation of \"Energy\":**\n    The Lagrangian does not explicitly depend on the affine parameter $\\lambda$. This implies that the \"energy\" associated with the Lagrangian is conserved. For a Lagrangian quadratic in velocities, this conserved quantity is the Lagrangian itself. Thus, $L$ is constant along the geodesic.\n    $$L = \\frac{1}{y^2}(\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2) = E.$$\n    We have the freedom to choose the affine parameter $\\lambda$. A convenient choice is to set $\\lambda$ to be the arc length $s$. In this case, the tangent vector has unit length, which means $L=1$.\n    $$\\frac{1}{y^2}(\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2) = 1.$$\n\n3.  **Equation for the Trajectory:**\n    Substitute the expression for $\\dot{x}$ from the momentum conservation into the energy conservation equation:\n    $$\\frac{1}{y^2}\\left(\\left(\\frac{C}{2}y^2\\right)^2 + \\dot{y}^2\\right) = 1$$\n    $$\\frac{1}{y^2}\\left(\\frac{C^2}{4}y^4 + \\dot{y}^2\\right) = 1$$\n    $$\\frac{C^2}{4}y^2 + \\frac{\\dot{y}^2}{y^2} = 1.$$\n    This equation describes the dynamics of the $y$-coordinate.\n\n4.  **Finding the Maximum Height:**\n    The maximum height $y_{max}$ is reached when the vertical component of the velocity, $\\dot{y}$, is zero. Setting $\\dot{y} = 0$ in the trajectory equation at $y = y_{max}$:\n    $$\\frac{C^2}{4}y_{max}^2 + 0 = 1$$\n    $$y_{max}^2 = \\frac{4}{C^2} \\implies y_{max} = \\frac{2}{|C|}.$$\n    Since we defined $\\theta_0 \\in (0, \\pi/2)$, the particle moves to the right ($\\dot{x}0$), so we expect $C0$. Thus, $y_{max} = 2/C$.\n\n5.  **Relating the Constant C to Initial Conditions:**\n    We need to determine the constant $C$ from the initial conditions at $(x_0, y_0) = (0, y_0)$. The angle $\\theta_0$ is between the initial velocity vector $v_0 = \\dot{x}_0 \\partial_x + \\dot{y}_0 \\partial_y$ and the vertical direction vector $u = \\partial_y$. The cosine of the angle between two vectors $v$ and $u$ in a Riemannian manifold is given by:\n    $$\\cos\\theta_0 = \\frac{g(v_0, u)}{\\sqrt{g(v_0, v_0)g(u, u)}}.$$\n    At the point $(0, y_0)$, the metric tensor components are $g_{xx} = g_{yy} = 1/y_0^2$ and $g_{xy}=0$.\n    The inner products are:\n    $$g(v_0, u) = g_{yy}\\dot{y}_0 \\cdot 1 = \\frac{\\dot{y}_0}{y_0^2}$$\n    $$g(u, u) = g_{yy} \\cdot 1^2 = \\frac{1}{y_0^2}$$\n    $$g(v_0, v_0) = \\frac{1}{y_0^2}(\\dot{x}_0^2 + \\dot{y}_0^2)$$\n    Because we parameterized with arc length, $g(v_0, v_0) = 1$. This implies:\n    $$\\frac{1}{y_0^2}(\\dot{x}_0^2 + \\dot{y}_0^2) = 1 \\implies \\sqrt{\\dot{x}_0^2 + \\dot{y}_0^2} = y_0.$$\n    Now we can compute $\\cos\\theta_0$:\n    $$\\cos\\theta_0 = \\frac{\\dot{y}_0/y_0^2}{\\sqrt{1} \\cdot \\sqrt{1/y_0^2}} = \\frac{\\dot{y}_0/y_0^2}{1/y_0} = \\frac{\\dot{y}_0}{y_0}.$$\n    Thus, $\\dot{y}_0 = y_0 \\cos\\theta_0$. For $\\theta_0 \\in (0, \\pi/2)$, we also have $\\sin\\theta_0 = \\sqrt{1-\\cos^2\\theta_0} = \\sqrt{1 - (\\dot{y}_0/y_0)^2} = \\sqrt{(y_0^2 - \\dot{y}_0^2)/y_0^2} = \\frac{\\dot{x}_0}{y_0}$.\n    This gives $\\dot{x}_0 = y_0 \\sin\\theta_0$.\n\n    Now we use the definition of the constant $C$ at the initial point:\n    $$C = \\frac{2\\dot{x}_0}{y_0^2} = \\frac{2(y_0 \\sin\\theta_0)}{y_0^2} = \\frac{2\\sin\\theta_0}{y_0}.$$\n\n6.  **Final Expression for $y_{max}$:**\n    Finally, substitute the expression for $C$ into the equation for $y_{max}$:\n    $$y_{max} = \\frac{2}{C} = \\frac{2}{(2\\sin\\theta_0)/y_0} = \\frac{y_0}{\\sin\\theta_0}.$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{y_0}{\\sin\\theta_0}}\n$$", "id": "1147384"}, {"introduction": "The principles for finding geodesics extend directly from curved spaces to the curved spacetimes of General Relativity.
