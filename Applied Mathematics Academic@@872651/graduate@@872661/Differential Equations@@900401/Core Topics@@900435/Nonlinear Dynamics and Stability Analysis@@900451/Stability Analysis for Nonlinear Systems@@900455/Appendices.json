A quadratic form $Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2$ is positive definite if and only if $A  0$ and $4AC - B^2  0$.\nFor $Q(x,y)$, we have $A=1$, $C=1$, and $B = -(\\alpha-2)$.\nThe first condition $A  0$ is satisfied since $10$.\nThe second condition is:\n$$\n4(1)(1) - (-(\\alpha-2))^2  0\n$$\n$$\n4 - (\\alpha - 2)^2  0\n$$\n$$\n(\\alpha - 2)^2  4\n$$\nTaking the square root of both sides:\n$$\n|\\alpha - 2|  2\n$$\nThis inequality can be written as:\n$$\n-2  \\alpha - 2  2\n$$\nAdding 2 to all parts gives:\n$$\n0  \\alpha  4\n$$\nFor any $\\alpha$ in this range, $Q(x,y)$ is positive definite, making $-2Q(x,y)$ negative definite.

For any other point, $\\dot{V}(x,y)  0$.\nTherefore, for $\\alpha=4$, $\\dot{V}$ is negative definite, and the origin is asymptotically stable.\n\n**Step 5: Analyze the case $\\alpha  4$**\n\nIf $\\alpha  4$, then $(\\alpha-2)  2$. Let $\\alpha - 2 = 2 + \\epsilon$ for some $\\epsilon  0$.\nThe quadratic part of $\\dot{V}$ is $-2(x^2 - (2+\\epsilon)xy + y^2)$.\nConsider the values of this term along the line $y=x$:\n$$\n-2(x^2 - (2+\\epsilon)x^2 + x^2) = -2(2x^2 - (2+\\epsilon)x^2) = -2(-\\epsilon x^2) = 2\\epsilon x^2\n$$\nSo, along the line $y=x$, the full expression for $\\dot{V}$ is:\n$$\n\\dot{V}(x,x) = 2\\epsilon x^2 - 2x^4 = 2x^2(\\epsilon - x^2)\n$$\nFor any point on the line $y=x$ with $0  |x|  \\sqrt{\\epsilon}$, we have $\\dot{V}(x,x)  0$.\nSince there are points arbitrarily close to the origin where $\\dot{V}$ is positive, the origin is unstable for any $\\alpha  4$. Therefore, stability cannot be established for $\\alpha  4$ using this Lyapunov function (or any other, as the system is indeed unstable).\n\nCombining our findings, the stability of the origin can be established using the given Lyapunov function for $0  \\alpha \\le 4$.
