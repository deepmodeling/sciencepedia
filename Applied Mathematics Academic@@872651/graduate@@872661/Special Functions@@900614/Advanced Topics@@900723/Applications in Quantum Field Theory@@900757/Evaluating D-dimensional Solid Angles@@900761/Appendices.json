The variables $X_1, \\dots, X_D$ are i.i.d. and drawn from a continuous distribution (the standard normal distribution). For any permutation $\\sigma$ of $\\{1, 2, \\dots, D\\}$, the probability of the specific ordering $X_{\\sigma(1)}  X_{\\sigma(2)}  \\dots  X_{\\sigma(D)}$ is the same due to the exchangeability of the variables. Since there are $D!$ possible strict orderings (the probability of a tie $X_i=X_j$ is zero), and these partition the entire sample space, the probability of any single specific ordering is $1/D!$.\nLet $\\mathcal{O}$ be the event that $X_1  X_2  \\dots  X_D$. Then,\n$$\nP(\\mathcal{O}) = \\frac{1}{D!}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the probability of the joint event $\\mathcal{O} \\cap \\{X_1  0\\}$. We can write this as:\n$$\nP(\\mathcal{O} \\cap \\{X_1  0\\}) = P(X_1  0 \\mid \\mathcal{O}) P(\\mathcal{O})\n$$\nThe event $\\mathcal{O}$ means that $X_1$ is the largest among all the variables. Let $X_{(1)}$ be the largest order statistic, i.e., $X_{(1)} = \\max\\{X_1, \\dots, X_D\\}$. The condition $\\mathcal{O}$ is equivalent to saying the event $\\{X_1 = X_{(1)}\\}$ has occurred, along with a specific ordering for the rest of the variables. So, the condition $X_1  0$ under the event $\\mathcal{O}$ is equivalent to the condition $X_{(1)}  0$. Therefore,\n$$\nP(X_1  0 \\mid \\mathcal{O}) = P(X_{(1)}  0 \\mid \\mathcal{O}) = P(X_{(1)}  0)\n$$\nThe last equality holds because the distribution of the maximum value $X_{(1)}$ is independent of which specific variable $X_i$ happens to be the maximum.\n\nNow we calculate $P(X_{(1)}  0)$. It is simpler to first calculate the complementary probability, $P(X_{(1)} \\le 0)$.\nThe maximum of a set of numbers is less than or equal to zero if and only if all numbers in the set are less than or equal to zero.\n$$\nP(X_{(1)} \\le 0) = P(X_1 \\le 0 \\text{ and } X_2 \\le 0 \\text{ and } \\dots \\text{ and } X_D \\le 0)\n$$\nSince the variables $X_i$ are i.i.d., the joint probability is the product of the individual probabilities:\n$$\nP(X_{(1)} \\le 0) = \\prod_{i=1}^D P(X_i \\le 0)\n$$\nFor a standard normal distribution (which is symmetric about 0), $P(X_i \\le 0) = 1/2$.\n$$\nP(X_{(1)} \\le 0) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^D = 2^{-D}\n$$\nTherefore, the probability that the maximum is positive is:\n$$\nP(X_{(1)}  0) = 1 - P(X_{(1)} \\le 0) = 1 - 2^{-D}\n$$\nFinally, we can compute the desired fractional solid angle:\n$$\n\\Omega(C, D) = P(\\mathcal{O} \\cap \\{X_1  0\\}) = P(X_{(1)}  0) \\times P(\\mathcal{O}) = (1 - 2^{-D}) \\times \\frac{1}{D!}\n$$\nSo the fractional solid angle is:\n$$\n\\Omega(C, D) = \\frac{1-2^{-D}}{D!}\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1-2^{-D}}{D!}}\n$$", "id": "660169"}]}
