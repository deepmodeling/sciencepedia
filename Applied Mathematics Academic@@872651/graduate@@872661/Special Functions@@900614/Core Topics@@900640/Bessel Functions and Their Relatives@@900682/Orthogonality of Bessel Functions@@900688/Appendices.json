Let's define two functions, $u(x) = J_0(\\alpha_1 x)$ and $v(x) = J_0(\\alpha_2 x)$. The Bessel function $J_0(kx)$ is a solution to the differential equation in Sturm-Liouville form:\n$$ (x y')' + k^2 x y = 0 $$\nTherefore, the functions $u(x)$ and $v(x)$ satisfy the following differential equations, respectively:\n$$ (x u')' + \\alpha_1^2 x u = 0 \\quad (1) $$\n$$ (x v')' + \\alpha_2^2 x v = 0 \\quad (2) $$\nHere, the prime denotes differentiation with respect to $x$.\n\nNow, we multiply equation (1) by $v(x)$ and equation (2) by $u(x)$:\n$$ v(x u')' + \\alpha_1^2 x u v = 0 \\quad (3) $$\n$$ u(x v')' + \\alpha_2^2 x u v = 0 \\quad (4) $$\nSubtracting equation (4) from equation (3), we get:\n$$ v(x u')' - u(x v')' + (\\alpha_1^2 - \\alpha_2^2) x u v = 0 $$\nThe first two terms can be recognized as the expansion of a derivative. Specifically, using the product rule, the derivative of $x(v u' - u v')$ is:\n$$ [x(v u' - u v')]' = (v u' - u v') + x(v'u' + v u'' - u'v' - u v'') = v(xu')' - u(xv')' $$\nSo, our equation can be rewritten as:\n$$ [x(v u' - u v')]' = (\\alpha_2^2 - \\alpha_1^2) x u v $$\nNow, we integrate both sides of this equation with respect to $x$ from $0$ to $1$:\n$$ \\int_0^1 [x(v u' - u v')]' \\,dx = \\int_0^1 (\\alpha_2^2 - \\alpha_1^2) x u v \\,dx $$\nThe left side can be evaluated using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\n$$ [x(v u' - u v')]_0^1 = (\\alpha_2^2 - \\alpha_1^2) \\int_0^1 x u v \\,dx $$\nLet's evaluate the boundary term on the left side:\nAt $x=1$: $1 \\cdot (v(1) u'(1) - u(1) v'(1))$.\nAt $x=0$: $0 \\cdot (v(0) u'(0) - u(0) v'(0)) = 0$.\n\nBy definition, $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2$ are the roots of $J_0(x)=0$. Therefore:\n$u(1) = J_0(\\alpha_1 \\cdot 1) = J_0(\\alpha_1) = 0$\n$v(1) = J_0(\\alpha_2 \\cdot 1) = J_0(\\alpha_2) = 0$\n\nSubstituting these values into the boundary term at $x=1$:\n$v(1) u'(1) - u(1) v'(1) = (0) \\cdot u'(1) - (0) \\cdot v'(1) = 0$.\n\nThus, the entire left side of the integrated equation is $0 - 0 = 0$.\nOur equation becomes:\n$$ 0 = (\\alpha_2^2 - \\alpha_1^2) \\int_0^1 x u(x) v(x) \\,dx $$\nSubstituting back the definitions of $u(x)$ and $v(x)$:\n$$ 0 = (\\alpha_2^2 - \\alpha_1^2) \\int_0^1 x J_0(\\alpha_1 x) J_0(\\alpha_2 x) \\,dx $$\nThe problem states that $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2$ are the first two *distinct* positive roots of $J_0(x)=0$.
