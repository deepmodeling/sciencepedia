The thermal diffusivity of the metal is $k$. The temperature distribution within the cylinder, $u(r, t)$, is a function of the radial distance $r$ from the center and time $t$, and is independent of the angular and axial coordinates. The surface of the cylinder at $r=R$ is maintained at a temperature of zero for all time $t > 0$. At time $t=0$, the cylinder has an initial temperature profile given by $u(r, 0) = T_0 J_0(\\alpha_{0,1} r/R)$, where $T_0$ is a constant with units of temperature, $J_0(x)$ is the Bessel function of the first kind of order zero, and $\\alpha_{0,1}$ is the first positive root of the equation $J_0(x)=0$.\n\nThe general solution for the temperature $u(r, t)$ that satisfies the governing heat equation for this system can be expressed as an infinite series:\n$$\nu(r,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\exp(-k \\lambda_n^2 t) \\left[A_n J_0(\\lambda_n r) + B_n Y_0(\\lambda_n r)\\right]\n$$\nwhere $J_0(x)$ and $Y_0(x)$ are the Bessel functions of the first and second kind of order zero, respectively.

The cylinder is described as \"solid\", which means the domain of the solution includes the central axis, where the radial coordinate is $r=0$. A physical property like temperature must be finite everywhere within the cylinder.\n\nWe must examine the behavior of the functions in the solution as $r \\to 0$. The Bessel function of the first kind, $J_0(x)$, is well-behaved at the origin, with $J_0(0) = 1$. However, the Bessel function of the second kind, $Y_0(x)$, is singular at the origin; it diverges to negative infinity as $x \\to 0$.
