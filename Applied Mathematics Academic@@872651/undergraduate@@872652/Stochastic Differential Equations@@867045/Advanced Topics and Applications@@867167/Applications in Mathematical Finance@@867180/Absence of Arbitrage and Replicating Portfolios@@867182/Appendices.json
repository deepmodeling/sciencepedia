The parameters are realistic.\n- The problem is non-trivial and tests core understanding.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\nA self-financing portfolio is described by $(\\phi, \\psi)$, where $\\phi$ is the number of shares of the risky asset and $\\psi$ is the number of units of the risk-free money market account. The initial value of the portfolio is $V_0 = \\phi S_0 + \\psi B_0$. Since $B_0=1$, this is $V_0 = \\phi S_0 + \\psi$. The terminal value is $V_1 = \\phi S_1 + \\psi B_1 = \\phi S_1 + \\psi (1+r)$.\n\nAn arbitrage is a self-financing portfolio that satisfies three conditions:\n1.  The initial cost is zero: $V_0 = \\phi S_0 + \\psi = 0$.\n2.  The terminal payoff is non-negative in all states: $V_1 \\ge 0$.\n3.  The terminal payoff is strictly positive in at least one state.\n\nFrom the zero-cost condition, we can express the holding in the risk-free asset in terms of the holding in the risky asset: $\\psi = -\\phi S_0$. This means the strategy consists of taking a position of $\\phi$ shares in the stock, financed by taking an opposite position of value $\\phi S_0$ in the money market account.\n\nSubstituting $\\psi$ into the expression for the terminal value, we get:\n$V_1 = \\phi S_1 + (-\\phi S_0)(1+r) = \\phi (S_1 - S_0(1+r))$.\n\nThe terminal value $V_1$ depends on the state of the market. Let's denote the payoffs in the up and down states as $V_{1,u}$ and $V_{1,d}$ respectively.\n- In the up state, $S_1 = S_0 u$, so the payoff is $V_{1,u} = \\phi (S_0 u - S_0(1+r)) = \\phi S_0 (u - (1+r))$.\n- In the down state, $S_1 = S_0 d$, so the payoff is $V_{1,d} = \\phi (S_0 d - S_0(1+r)) = \\phi S_0 (d - (1+r))$.\n\nFor an arbitrage to exist, we must have $V_{1,u} \\ge 0$, $V_{1,d} \\ge 0$, and at least one of these must be a strict inequality. Let's consider two cases for $\\phi$.\n\nCase 1: $\\phi > 0$ (long position in the stock, short in the bond).\nSince $\\phi S_0 > 0$, the arbitrage conditions become:\n- $u - (1+r) \\ge 0 \\implies u \\ge 1+r$.\n- $d - (1+r) \\ge 0 \\implies d \\ge 1+r$.\n- At least one strict inequality must hold. Since it is standard to assume $u > d$ for a non-trivial model, if $d \\ge 1+r$, then $u > d \\ge 1+r$, which implies $u > 1+r$. In this case, $V_{1,u} > 0$ and $V_{1,d} \\ge 0$. Thus, an arbitrage opportunity exists if $d \\ge 1+r$. This strategy involves borrowing money to buy the stock, as the stock's growth in both scenarios is at least as good as the interest on the loan.\n\nCase 2: $\\phi < 0$ (short position in the stock, long in the bond).\nSince $\\phi S_0 < 0$, the signs of the inequalities are reversed for the arbitrage conditions:\n- $u - (1+r) \\le 0 \\implies u \\le 1+r$.\n- $d - (1+r) \\le 0 \\implies d \\le 1+r$.\n- At least one strict inequality must hold. Since $u > d$, if $u \\le 1+r$, then $d < u \\le 1+r$, which implies $d < 1+r$. In this case, $V_{1,d} > 0$ and $V_{1,u} \\ge 0$. Thus, an arbitrage opportunity exists if $u \\le 1+r$. This strategy involves short-selling the stock and investing the proceeds in the risk-free asset, as the risk-free return is at least as good as the stock's growth in both scenarios.\n\nTo preclude any arbitrage opportunity, both of these cases must be prevented.\n- To prevent arbitrage from Case 1, we must have the opposite of its condition, i.e., $d < 1+r$.\n- To prevent arbitrage from Case 2, we must have the opposite of its condition, i.e., $u > 1+r$.\n\nCombining these, the necessary condition for the absence of arbitrage is $d < 1+r < u$. This ensures that the risk-free return lies strictly between the returns of the risky asset in the down and up states.\n\nNow, we analyze the specific parameter values: $S_0=80$, $u=1.05$, $d=1.03$, and $r=0.02$.\nThe risk-free growth factor is $1+r = 1+0.02 = 1.02$.\nWe check the no-arbitrage condition: $d < 1+r < u$.\nSubstituting the values: $1.03 < 1.02 < 1.05$.\nThis statement is false because $1.03$ is not less than $1.02$. Specifically, we have $d=1.03 > 1+r=1.02$.\nTherefore, the market violates the no-arbitrage condition. The violation corresponds to Case 1, where $d \\ge 1+r$, indicating an arbitrage opportunity by taking a long position in the stock financed by borrowing.\n\nWe now construct an explicit arbitrage strategy. Let's choose to buy $\\phi=1$ share of the stock.\n- The cost to buy the stock is $\\phi S_0 = 1 \\times 80 = 80$.\n- To create a zero-cost portfolio, we must borrow this amount. This corresponds to setting our holding in the money market account to $\\psi = -80$.\n- The initial value of this portfolio is $V_0 = \\phi S_0 + \\psi B_0 = (1)(80) + (-80)(1) = 0$.\n\nNext, we compute the terminal payoffs for this strategy. The terminal obligation on the loan is $\\psi B_1 = -80 \\times (1+0.02) = -80 \\times 1.02 = -81.6$. The portfolio's terminal value is $V_1 = \\phi S_1 - 81.6 = S_1 - 81.6$.\n- In the up state, the stock price becomes $S_{1,u} = S_0 u = 80 \\times 1.05 = 84$.\nThe terminal payoff is $V_{1,u} = 84 - 81.6 = 2.4$.\n- In the down state, the stock price becomes $S_{1,d} = S_0 d = 80 \\times 1.03 = 82.4$.\nThe terminal payoff is $V_{1,d} = 82.4 - 81.6 = 0.8$.\n\nThe strategy yields a profit of $2.4$ in the up state and $0.8$ in the down state, with zero initial investment. Both payoffs are strictly positive, confirming this is an arbitrage.\n\nThe final question is to find the minimum guaranteed profit per share.\nThe profit of the strategy per share held is given by $\\frac{V_1}{\\phi}$.\n- Profit per share in up state: $\\frac{V_{1,u}}{\\phi} = \\frac{\\phi S_0 (u - (1+r))}{\\phi} = S_0 (u - (1+r)) = 80(1.05-1.02) = 80(0.03) = 2.4$.\n- Profit per share in down state: $\\frac{V_{1,d}}{\\phi} = \\frac{\\phi S_0 (d - (1+r))}{\\phi} = S_0 (d - (1+r)) = 80(1.03-1.02) = 80(0.01) = 0.8$.\n\nThe minimum guaranteed profit per share is the minimum of these two values.\nMinimum guaranteed profit per share $= \\min(2.4, 0.8) = 0.8$.\nThis value is independent of the number of shares $\\phi$ chosen for the arbitrage portfolio (as long as $\\phi>0$).\nThe final answer is expressed in currency units, so it is $0.8$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.8}$$", "id": "3038414"}, {"introduction": "While the Black-Scholes model guarantees perfect replication in theory, real-world trading happens at discrete moments, not continuously.

I will proceed with deriving the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires analyzing the hedging error that arises from rebalancing a delta hedge at discrete time intervals, rather than continuously. Let's construct a portfolio to analyze this error.\n\nConsider a portfolio formed at time $t$ that is short one unit of the contingent claim $V$ and long $\\Delta_t = \\partial_S V(S_t,t)$ units of the underlying asset $S$. The remainder of the portfolio's value is held in the money market account $B_t$. To make the portfolio's net value zero at time $t$, the amount in the money market must be $V(S_t,t) - \\Delta_t S_t$.\nThe value of this hedged portfolio at time $t$ is:\n$$ \\Pi_t = -V(S_t,t) + \\Delta_t S_t + \\left(V(S_t,t) - \\Delta_t S_t\\right) = 0 $$\nThe position $\\Delta_t$ is held constant until time $t+\\Delta t$. The change in the value of the portfolio over the interval $[t, t+\\Delta t]$, denoted $\\Delta \\Pi$, represents the profit or loss from this discrete hedging strategy.\n$$ \\Delta \\Pi = \\Pi_{t+\\Delta t} - \\Pi_t = \\Pi_{t+\\Delta t} $$\nThe value at $t+\\Delta t$ is:\n$$ \\Pi_{t+\\Delta t} = -V(S_{t+\\Delta t}, t+\\Delta t) + \\Delta_t S_{t+\\Delta t} + (V(S_t,t) - \\Delta_t S_t) \\frac{B_{t+\\Delta t}}{B_t} $$\nFor a small time step $\\Delta t$, we can approximate the growth of the money market account as $\\frac{B_{t+\\Delta t}}{B_t} \\approx 1 + r_t \\Delta t$.\n$$ \\Pi_{t+\\Delta t} \\approx -V_{t+\\Delta t} + \\Delta_t S_{t+\\Delta t} + (V_t - \\Delta_t S_t)(1 + r_t \\Delta t) $$\nLet $\\Delta V = V_{t+\\Delta t} - V_t$ and $\\Delta S = S_{t+\\Delta t} - S_t$.\n$$ \\Delta \\Pi \\approx -(V_t + \\Delta V) + \\Delta_t (S_t + \\Delta S) + V_t - \\Delta_t S_t + r_t(V_t - \\Delta_t S_t)\\Delta t $$\n$$ \\Delta \\Pi \\approx -\\Delta V + \\Delta_t \\Delta S + r_t(V_t - \\Delta_t S_t)\\Delta t $$\nNow, we apply a Taylor expansion for $\\Delta V$ using Itô's Lemma. For a function $V(S,t)$, the change $\\Delta V$ over a small interval is approximately:\n$$ \\Delta V \\approx \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} \\Delta t + \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S} \\Delta S + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial S^2} (\\Delta S)^2 $$\nSubstituting the definitions $\\Delta_t = \\partial_S V$ and $\\Gamma_t = \\partial_{SS}V$:\n$$ \\Delta \\Pi \\approx -\\left( \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t}\\Delta t + \\Delta_t \\Delta S + \\frac{1}{2}\\Gamma_t (\\Delta S)^2 \\right) + \\Delta_t \\Delta S + r_t(V_t - \\Delta_t S_t)\\Delta t $$\nThe terms $\\Delta_t \\Delta S$ cancel out:\n$$ \\Delta \\Pi \\approx -\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t}\\Delta t - \\frac{1}{2}\\Gamma_t (\\Delta S)^2 + r_t V_t \\Delta t - r_t \\Delta_t S_t \\Delta t $$\nThis expression represents the P&L of the hedging portfolio. The value function $V$ of the derivative must satisfy the Black-Scholes partial differential equation (PDE):\n$$ \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_t^2 S_t^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial S^2} + r_t S_t \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial S} - r_t V = 0 $$\nUsing $\\Delta_t$ and $\\Gamma_t$, and rearranging:\n$$ -\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial t} + r_t V_t - r_t \\Delta_t S_t = \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_t^2 S_t^2 \\Gamma_t $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\Delta \\Pi$:\n$$ \\Delta \\Pi \\approx \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_t^2 S_t^2 \\Gamma_t\\right)\\Delta t - \\frac{1}{2}\\Gamma_t (\\Delta S)^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\Gamma_t \\left( \\sigma_t^2 S_t^2 \\Delta t - (\\Delta S)^2 \\right) $$\nThis is the profit/loss of the strategy. The \"hedging error\" is conventionally defined as the cost, or shortfall, of the hedge, which is the negative of the P&L:\n$$ \\text{Hedging Error} = -\\Delta \\Pi \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\Gamma_t \\left( (\\Delta S)^2 - \\sigma_t^2 S_t^2 \\Delta t \\right) $$\nTo find the leading-order stochastic contribution, we examine $(\\Delta S)^2$. From the SDE for $S_t$, we have $\\Delta S \\approx \\mu_t S_t \\Delta t + \\sigma_t S_t \\Delta W$. The squared increment is dominated by the stochastic term:\n$$ (\\Delta S)^2 = (\\mu_t S_t \\Delta t + \\sigma_t S_t \\Delta W)^2 = \\sigma_t^2 S_t^2 (\\Delta W)^2 + 2\\mu_t\\sigma_t S_t^2 \\Delta t \\Delta W + \\mu_t^2 S_t^2 (\\Delta t)^2 $$\nThe term with $(\\Delta W)^2$ is of order $O(\\Delta t)$, while the cross-term is $O((\\Delta t)^{3/2})$ and the last term is $O((\\Delta t)^2)$. The leading-order term is $\\sigma_t^2 S_t^2 (\\Delta W)^2$.\nSubstituting this into the error expression:\n$$ \\text{Hedging Error} \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\Gamma_t \\left( \\sigma_t^2 S_t^2 (\\Delta W)^2 - \\sigma_t^2 S_t^2 \\Delta t \\right) $$\n$$ \\text{Hedging Error} \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\Gamma_t \\sigma_t^2 S_t^2 \\left( (\\Delta W)^2 - \\Delta t \\right) $$\nThis expression represents the leading-order hedging error. The term $(\\Delta W)^2$ is the realized quadratic variation over $[t, t+\\Delta t]$, while $\\Delta t$ is its expectation, $E[(\\Delta W)^2]=\\Delta t$. The expression $(\\Delta W)^2-\\Delta t$ is a random variable with mean zero, representing the purely stochastic fluctuation of realized volatility around its expected value.\n\nNow, for the second part of the question: continuous trading. In the continuous-time limit ($\\Delta t \\to dt$), a perfectly replicating self-financing portfolio $\\Pi_t$ has a value that changes as $d\\Pi_t = \\Delta_t dS_t + r_t(V_t - \\Delta_t S_t)dt$. The value of the option $V_t$ changes according to Itô's lemma: $dV_t = (\\partial_t V + \\mu_t S_t \\partial_S V + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_t^2 S_t^2 \\partial_{SS}V)dt + \\sigma_t S_t \\partial_S V dW_t$. To eliminate the stochastic risk, we must match the $dW_t$ terms. The $dW_t$ term in $d\\Pi_t$ comes from $\\Delta_t dS_t = \\Delta_t(\\mu_t S_t dt + \\sigma_t S_t dW_t)$. By choosing the holding $\\Delta_t = \\partial_S V$ at every instant, the stochastic term of the hedge, $\\Delta_t \\sigma_t S_t dW_t$, becomes identical to the stochastic term of the option's value change, $\\sigma_t S_t (\\partial_S V) dW_t$. Therefore, the difference in their changes, $d V_t - d\\Pi_t$, will have no $dW_t$ component, meaning the portfolio is risk-free over the infinitesimal interval $dt$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The leading-order stochastic hedging error over $[t,t+\\Delta t]$ is approximately $\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\Gamma(S_t,t)\\,\\sigma_t^2\\,S_t^2\\left[(\\Delta W)^2-\\Delta t\\right]$, because the realized quadratic variation $(\\Delta W)^2$ fluctuates around its mean $\\Delta t$. Under continuous trading, setting $\\Delta_t=\\partial_S V(S_t,t)$ at each instant makes the $dS_t$ term in $dV-\\Delta_t\\,dS_t$ vanish, so the $dW_t$ risk is eliminated by Itô calculus, leaving only $dt$ terms.**\n\n-   **Hedging Error:** The formula $\\frac{1}{2}\\Gamma \\sigma_t^2 S_t^2 \\left( (\\Delta W)^2 - \\Delta t \\right)$ perfectly matches our derived expression for the hedging error (cost of hedging). The explanation that this arises from fluctuations of realized versus expected quadratic variation is also correct.\n-   **Continuous Trading:** The explanation is conceptually correct. By setting $\\Delta_t=\\partial_S V$, the stochastic component of $\\Delta_t dS_t$ exactly cancels the stochastic component of $dV_t$. The expression $dV_t - (\\partial_S V)dS_t$ simplifies to $(\\partial_t V + \\frac{1}{2}\\Gamma_t \\sigma_t^2 S_t^2)dt$, which contains only a $dt$ term, thus eliminating the $dW_t$ risk. While the phrasing \"makes the $dS_t$ term...vanish\" is slightly imprecise, the outcome described is correct.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. The leading-order stochastic hedging error over $[t,t+\\Delta t]$ is approximately $\\Gamma(S_t,t)\\,\\sigma_t\\,S_t^2\\,\\Delta W$, and continuous trading cannot remove the $dW_t$ term because $\\sigma_t>0$ implies unavoidable diffusion risk.**\n\n-   **Hedging Error:** The term $\\Gamma\\sigma S^2 \\Delta W$ is of order $O((\\Delta t)^{1/2})$, which is not the leading-order error term. Our derivation shows the leading stochastic effect is of order $O(\\Delta t)$. This formula is incorrect.\n-   **Continuous Trading:** The statement that continuous trading cannot remove the diffusion risk is fundamentally false. It contradicts the central principle of replication and delta-hedging.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The leading-order hedging error over $[t,t+\\Delta t]$ is deterministically $\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\Gamma(S_t,t)\\,\\sigma_t^2\\,S_t^2\\,\\Delta t$, and continuous trading eliminates both the drift and diffusion terms so that the hedged portfolio has zero $dt$ and $dW_t$ components.**\n\n-   **Hedging Error:** The hedging error over a discrete interval is inherently stochastic because $(\\Delta S)^2$ is a random variable. The claim that it is deterministic is false. The expression provided is related to the expected cost of gamma, not the error itself.\n-   **Continuous Trading:** Delta-hedging eliminates the diffusion ($dW_t$) term mismatch. The drift ($dt$) term mismatch is eliminated only if the Black-Scholes PDE holds, which is a condition for the absence of arbitrage, not a direct consequence of the hedging action itself.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The hedging error is independent of $\\Gamma$ and is controlled solely by the time decay $V_t$, so over $[t,t+\\Delta t]$ it is $V_t\\,\\Delta t$, and continuous trading eliminates the $dW_t$ term by setting $\\mu_t=r_t$ under the risk-neutral measure.**\n\n-   **Hedging Error:** The hedging error due to discrete rebalancing is fundamentally a consequence of the option's convexity, which is measured by $\\Gamma$. An option with $\\Gamma=0$ (e.g., a forward) has no such error.

Extraction of Givens:**\n- A filtered probability space supports two independent standard Brownian motions, $W^{(1)}$ and $W^{(2)}$, under an Equivalent Martingale Measure (EMM) $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n- The risk-free bank account price is $B_{t} = \\exp(rt)$.\n- A single risky asset has a discounted price $\\tilde{S}_{t} = S_{t}/B_{t}$.\n- The SDE for the discounted asset price is $d\\tilde{S}_{t} = \\sigma_{1}\\, dW^{(1)}_{t} + \\sigma_{2}\\, dW^{(2)}_{t}$, where $\\sigma_{1}$ and $\\sigma_{2}$ are positive constants. $\\tilde{S}_{t}$ is a $\\mathbb{Q}$-martingale.\n- The market is incomplete.\n- The discounted contingent claim payoff at time $T$ is $\\tilde{H} = \\alpha\\, W^{(1)}_{T} + \\beta\\, W^{(2)}_{T}$, with constants $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n- The minimal-variance hedging strategy, $\\phi_{t}$, is the predictable, square-integrable process that minimizes the mean-square hedging error: $\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\!\\left[\\left(\\tilde{H} - \\int_{0}^{T} \\phi_{t}\\, d\\tilde{S}_{t}\\right)^{2}\\right]$.\n- The specific constant values are $\\sigma_{1} = 3$, $\\sigma_{2} = 1$, $\\alpha = 1$, and $\\beta = 2$.\n\n**2. Validation:**\n- **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is firmly rooted in the theory of mathematical finance, specifically stochastic calculus, martingale representation theory (Galtchouk-Kunita-Watanabe theorem), and hedging in incomplete markets. These are well-established and rigorous mathematical concepts. The model is a standard framework for studying such problems.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem seeks to minimize a quadratic functional in a Hilbert space ($L^{2}(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}_T, \\mathbb{Q})$), which corresponds to finding an orthogonal projection.

Verdict:**\nThe problem is valid.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivation\n\nThe objective is to find the predictable process $\\phi_{t}$ that minimizes the mean-square hedging error, which is the expected squared difference between the discounted claim $\\tilde{H}$ and the value of the self-financing hedging portfolio at time $T$. The value of the hedging portfolio, starting from zero initial wealth, is given by the stochastic integral $\\int_{0}^{T} \\phi_{u}\\, d\\tilde{S}_{u}$. We want to minimize:\n$$\nJ(\\phi) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\left[\\left(\\tilde{H} - \\int_{0}^{T} \\phi_{t}\\, d\\tilde{S}_{t}\\right)^{2}\\right]\n$$\nThis is a least-squares problem in the Hilbert space $L^{2}(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}_{T}, \\mathbb{Q})$. The solution is found by making the hedging error, $\\tilde{H} - \\int_{0}^{T} \\phi_{t}\\, d\\tilde{S}_{t}$, orthogonal to the space of all possible stochastic integrals with respect to $\\tilde{S}_{t}$.\n\nA more direct approach is to use the martingale representation theorem (specifically the Galtchouk-Kunita-Watanabe decomposition). Any square-integrable martingale can be represented as a stochastic integral with respect to the underlying Brownian motions.\nThe discounted claim $\\tilde{H} = \\alpha W^{(1)}_{T} + \\beta W^{(2)}_{T}$ can be written as the terminal value of a martingale. Since $W_{T} = \\int_{0}^{T} dW_t$ for any Brownian motion, we have:\n$$\n\\tilde{H} = \\alpha \\int_{0}^{T} 1 \\cdot dW^{(1)}_{t} + \\beta \\int_{0}^{T} 1 \\cdot dW^{(2)}_{t} = \\int_{0}^{T} \\alpha\\, dW^{(1)}_{t} + \\int_{0}^{T} \\beta\\, dW^{(2)}_{t}\n$$\nThe value of the hedging portfolio is given by:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T} \\phi_{t}\\, d\\tilde{S}_{t} = \\int_{0}^{T} \\phi_{t} (\\sigma_{1}\\, dW^{(1)}_{t} + \\sigma_{2}\\, dW^{(2)}_{t}) = \\int_{0}^{T} \\phi_{t}\\sigma_{1}\\, dW^{(1)}_{t} + \\int_{0}^{T} \\phi_{t}\\sigma_{2}\\, dW^{(2)}_{t}\n$$\nThe hedging error is the difference between these two quantities:\n$$\n\\text{Error} = \\tilde{H} - \\int_{0}^{T} \\phi_{t}\\, d\\tilde{S}_{t} = \\int_{0}^{T} (\\alpha - \\phi_{t}\\sigma_{1})\\, dW^{(1)}_{t} + \\int_{0}^{T} (\\beta - \\phi_{t}\\sigma_{2})\\, dW^{(2)}_{t}\n$$\nWe need to minimize the expectation of the square of this error. Because $W^{(1)}$ and $W^{(2)}$ are independent standard Brownian motions, the stochastic integrals with respect to them are orthogonal. Using the Itô isometry property, which states that $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\int_{0}^{T} f_t dW_t\\right)^2\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{T} f_t^2 dt\\right]$, the mean-square error is:\n$$\nJ(\\phi) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\left[\\left(\\int_{0}^{T} (\\alpha - \\phi_{t}\\sigma_{1})\\, dW^{(1)}_{t}\\right)^2\\right] + \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\left[\\left(\\int_{0}^{T} (\\beta - \\phi_{t}\\sigma_{2})\\, dW^{(2)}_{t}\\right)^2\\right]\n$$\n$$\nJ(\\phi) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\left[\\int_{0}^{T} (\\alpha - \\phi_{t}\\sigma_{1})^2\\, dt\\right] + \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\left[\\int_{0}^{T} (\\beta - \\phi_{t}\\sigma_{2})^2\\, dt\\right]\n$$\nBy Fubini's theorem, we can swap the expectation and integral:\n$$\nJ(\\phi) = \\int_{0}^{T} \\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{Q}}\\left[ (\\alpha - \\phi_{t}\\sigma_{1})^2 + (\\beta - \\phi_{t}\\sigma_{2})^2 \\right]\\, dt\n$$\nTo minimize this integral, we can minimize the integrand for each $t \\in [0, T]$. Since $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\sigma_{1}$, and $\\sigma_{2}$ are constants, we look for a constant strategy $\\phi_{t} = \\phi$. The problem reduces to minimizing the following function of $\\phi$:\n$$\nf(\\phi) = (\\alpha - \\phi\\sigma_{1})^2 + (\\beta - \\phi\\sigma_{2})^2\n$$\nTo find the minimum, we compute the derivative of $f(\\phi)$ with respect to $\\phi$ and set it to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{df}{d\\phi} = 2(\\alpha - \\phi\\sigma_{1})(-\\sigma_{1}) + 2(\\beta - \\phi\\sigma_{2})(-\\sigma_{2}) = 0\n$$\n$$\n-\\alpha\\sigma_{1} + \\phi\\sigma_{1}^2 - \\beta\\sigma_{2} + \\phi\\sigma_{2}^2 = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\phi(\\sigma_{1}^2 + \\sigma_{2}^2) = \\alpha\\sigma_{1} + \\beta\\sigma_{2}\n$$\nSolving for $\\phi$, we get:\n$$\n\\phi = \\frac{\\alpha\\sigma_{1} + \\beta\\sigma_{2}}{\\sigma_{1}^2 + \\sigma_{2}^2}\n$$\nThe second derivative, $\\frac{d^2f}{d\\phi^2} = 2\\sigma_{1}^2 + 2\\sigma_{2}^2$, is positive since $\\sigma_{1}$ and $\\sigma_{2}$ are positive, confirming that this value of $\\phi$ corresponds to a minimum.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $\\sigma_{1} = 3$, $\\sigma_{2} = 1$, $\\alpha = 1$, and $\\beta = 2$.\n$$\n\\phi = \\frac{(1)(3) + (2)(1)}{(3)^2 + (1)^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\phi = \\frac{3 + 2}{9 + 1}\n$$\n$$\n\\phi = \\frac{5}{10}\n$$\n$$\n\\phi = 0.5\n$$\nThe minimal-variance hedging strategy is to hold a constant number of units $\\phi_{t} = 0.5$ of the risky asset.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.5}\n$$", "id": "3038453"}]}
