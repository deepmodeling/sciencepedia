Round your answer to four significant figures.", "solution": "The problem requires constructing a static arbitrage strategy based on a potential violation of the put-call parity relationship and calculating the guaranteed profit at maturity. The analysis proceeds from the first principles of no-arbitrage and replication.\n\nThe fundamental put-call parity relationship for European options on a non-dividend-paying stock is derived by constructing two portfolios with identical payoffs at maturity $T$. Under the no-arbitrage assumption, these portfolios must have the same price at time $t=0$. The relationship is given by:\n$$C_{0} + K e^{-rT} = P_{0} + S_{0}$$\nwhere $C_0$ is the price of the call option at time $0$, $P_0$ is the price of the put option at time $0$, $S_0$ is the stock price at time $0$, $K$ is the strike price, $r$ is the continuously compounded risk-free rate, and $T$ is the time to maturity.\n\nThe left-hand side, $C_{0} + K e^{-rT}$, represents the cost of a portfolio comprising one long call option and an amount of cash equal to $K e^{-rT}$ invested at the risk-free rate (i.e., a long position in a zero-coupon bond with face value $K$). The right-hand side, $P_{0} + S_{0}$, represents the cost of a portfolio comprising one long put option and one long share of the stock. At maturity $T$, both portfolios have a guaranteed payoff of $\\max(S_T, K)$, where $S_T$ is the stock price at time $T$.\n\nFirst, we must verify if the given market prices violate this parity relationship. The provided data are:\n- Stock price: $S_{0} = 105$\n- Strike price: $K = 100$\n- Risk-free rate: $r = 0.03$\n- Time to maturity: $T = 1$\n- Call price: $C_{0} = 12.50$\n- Put price: $P_{0} = 3.00$\n\nLet us calculate the value of both sides of the parity equation.\nValue of the left-hand side (LHS):\n$$LHS = C_{0} + K e^{-rT} = 12.50 + 100 \\times \\exp(-0.03 \\times 1)$$\n$$LHS = 12.50 + 100 \\times \\exp(-0.03) \\approx 12.50 + 100 \\times 0.97044553 = 12.50 + 97.044553 = 109.544553$$\n\nValue of the right-hand side (RHS):\n$$RHS = P_{0} + S_{0} = 3.00 + 105 = 108.00$$\n\nComparing the two sides, we find that $109.544553 > 108.00$. Therefore, put-call parity is violated:\n$$C_{0} + K e^{-rT} > P_{0} + S_{0}$$\nThis inequality signifies an arbitrage opportunity. The portfolio consisting of a call option and a risk-free bond is overpriced relative to the portfolio consisting of a put option and the stock.\n\nThe arbitrage strategy is to sell the overpriced portfolio and buy the underpriced one. However, a clearer construction involves creating a synthetic risk-free asset. Consider a portfolio constructed at time $t=0$ consisting of one long put option, one long share of stock, and one short call option.\nThe cost of establishing this portfolio at $t=0$ is:\n$$\\text{Cost}_{0} = P_{0} + S_{0} - C_{0} = 3.00 + 105.00 - 12.50 = 95.50$$\nThe payoff of this portfolio at maturity $T$ is:\n$$\\text{Payoff}_{T} = (\\text{Payoff from put}) + (\\text{Payoff from stock}) - (\\text{Payoff from call})$$\n$$\\text{Payoff}_{T} = \\max(K - S_{T}, 0) + S_{T} - \\max(S_{T} - K, 0)$$\nWe analyze this payoff for the two possible scenarios at maturity:\n1. If $S_{T} > K$: Payoff$_{T} = 0 + S_{T} - (S_{T} - K) = K = 100$.\n2. If $S_{T} \\leq K$: Payoff$_{T} = (K - S_{T}) + S_{T} - 0 = K = 100$.\nThe portfolio has a certain, risk-free payoff of $K = 100$ at time $T$. It is a synthetic zero-coupon bond with a face value of $K$.\n\nThe fair price of such a bond at time $t=0$ should be its discounted future value, which is $K e^{-rT} = 100 \\times \\exp(-0.03) \\approx 97.044553$.\nThe market price of creating this synthetic bond is $\\text{Cost}_{0} = 95.50$. Since the market price ($95.50$) is less than the fair value ($\\approx 97.05$), the synthetic bond is underpriced.\n\nThe arbitrage strategy is to buy the underpriced synthetic bond and finance it by selling (shorting) the fairly priced equivalent, which is borrowing at the risk-free rate.\n\nThe explicit trades at time $t=0$ are:\n1.  **Buy one European put option**: Cash outflow of $P_{0} = 3.00$.\n2.  **Buy one share of stock**: Cash outflow of $S_{0} = 105.00$.\n3.  **Sell (write) one European call option**: Cash inflow of $C_{0} = 12.50$.\nThis set of trades requires a net cash payment of $3.00 + 105.00 - 12.50 = 95.50$.\n4.  **Finance this payment by borrowing**: Borrow the amount $95.50$ from the risk-free bank account. This is a cash inflow of $95.50$.\n\nThe total net cash flow at time $t=0$ is $0$, so the strategy is self-financing.\n\nAt maturity $T=1$, the positions are closed:\n1.  The portfolio (long put, long stock, short call) yields a guaranteed cash inflow of $K = 100.00$.\n2.  The amount borrowed, $95.50$, must be repaid with interest. The repayment amount is $95.50 \\times e^{rT} = 95.50 \\times \\exp(0.03 \\times 1)$.\n\nThe guaranteed arbitrage profit at time $T$ is the difference between the cash inflow from the asset portfolio and the cash outflow for the loan repayment.\n$$\\text{Profit}_{T} = K - (P_{0} + S_{0} - C_{0}) e^{rT}$$\n$$\\text{Profit}_{T} = 100 - (95.50) \\times \\exp(0.03)$$\nUsing a calculator for the values:\n$$\\exp(0.03) \\approx 1.03045453$$\n$$\\text{Loan Repayment} \\approx 95.50 \\times 1.03045453 \\approx 98.408408$$\n$$\\text{Profit}_{T} \\approx 100 - 98.408408 = 1.591592$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$\\text{Profit}_{T} \\approx 1.592$$\nThis value represents the risk-free profit guaranteed at maturity by exploiting the mispricing in the options market.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.592}$$", "id": "3079682"}, {"introduction": "Having explored static arbitrage, we now turn to the dynamic nature of option pricing within the Black-Scholes-Merton framework.

Even for a deep in-the-money call with positive remaining time $ T $, there is a strictly positive probability of expiring out-of-the-money due to volatility $ \\sigma $, so the call’s sensitivity to $ S_0 $ is strictly less than $ 1 $ because it is governed by a standard-normal tail probability evaluated at a finite input. A higher $ r $ increases the risk-neutral drift, raises that input, and moves the sensitivity closer to $ 1 $, but it remains below $ 1 $ unless $ \\sigma \\to 0 $ or $ T \\to 0 $.\n\nB. Static arbitrage requires every call option to have delta strictly less than $ 1 $ at positive maturities because the option price is discounted by $ e^{-rT} $, which forces the derivative of price with respect to $ S_0 $ to equal $ e^{-rT} $, independently of $ \\sigma $; therefore $ r $ mechanically keeps the delta away from $ 1 $.\n\nC. The call’s sensitivity equals the risk-neutral probability of expiring in-the-money based on the standard normal cumulative evaluated at a lower input that does not depend on $ r $, so the delta is less than $ 1 $ for finite $ T $, and $ r $ plays no role in determining it.\n\nD. A deep in-the-money call can have a delta less than $ 1 $ only if $ r  0 $.

There is no ambiguity or subjective language.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is a standard and well-posed theoretical question in quantitative finance. I will now proceed to derive the solution.\n\nThe delta, $ \\Delta_C $, of a European call option on a non-dividend-paying stock in the BSM model is the first partial derivative of the option price, $ C $, with respect to the underlying stock price, $ S_t $. It is given by:\n$$ \\Delta_C = N(d_1) $$\nwhere $ N(\\cdot) $ is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution, and at time $ t=0 $, the parameter $ d_1 $ is defined as:\n$$ d_1 = \\frac{\\ln(S_0/K) + (r + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)T}{\\sigma \\sqrt{T}} $$\n\nThe problem states that the option is deep in-the-money, meaning $ \\ln(S_0/K) $ is a large positive number. It also states that $ \\sigma > 0 $ and $ T > 0 $, which implies the denominator $ \\sigma \\sqrt{T} $ is a finite, positive constant.\nGiven that all parameters ($ S_0, K, r, \\sigma, T $) are finite, the term $ d_1 $ is a finite, although potentially large, positive number.\nThe standard normal CDF, $ N(x) $, has the property that for any finite $ x $, $ N(x)  1 $. The limit is $ \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} N(x) = 1 $.\nTherefore, because $ d_1 $ is finite, the delta $ \\Delta_C = N(d_1) $ must be strictly less than $ 1 $.\n\nThe fundamental reason for this is the stochastic nature of the stock price. The future stock price at maturity, $ S_T $, is a random variable. Even if the current price $ S_0 $ is much larger than the strike $ K $, the presence of positive volatility ($ \\sigma > 0 $) and positive time to maturity ($ T > 0 $) implies there is a non-zero probability that a series of adverse price movements could cause the stock price to fall below the strike price by maturity. This possibility, however remote, prevents the option from behaving exactly like a share of stock (which has a delta of $ 1 $), hence $ \\Delta_C  1 $. Delta would only reach exactly $ 1 $ in the limit where $ d_1 \\to \\infty $, which occurs if $ T \\to 0 $, $ \\sigma \\to 0 $, or $ S_0/K \\to \\infty $.\n\nNow, let us examine the role of the risk-free rate $ r $. The parameter $ d_1 $ is a function of $ r $. To see its effect, we take the partial derivative of $ d_1 $ with respect to $ r $:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial d_1}{\\partial r} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( \\frac{\\ln(S_0/K) + (r + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)T}{\\sigma \\sqrt{T}} \\right) = \\frac{T}{\\sigma \\sqrt{T}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{T}}{\\sigma} $$\nSince we are given $ T > 0 $ and $ \\sigma > 0 $, this derivative is strictly positive. This means that an increase in the risk-free rate $ r $ leads to an increase in $ d_1 $.\nBecause the standard normal CDF $ N(x) $ is a monotonically increasing function, a higher value of $ d_1 $ results in a higher value of $ N(d_1) $. Consequently, a higher risk-free rate $ r $ increases the call's delta, pushing it closer to $ 1 $. The rate $ r $ contributes to the risk-neutral drift of the stock price, $(r - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)$. A higher drift increases the likelihood of the option expiring in-the-money, which is reflected in a higher delta.\n\nWith this analysis, we evaluate the given options.\n\n**A. Even for a deep in-the-money call with positive remaining time $ T $, there is a strictly positive probability of expiring out-of-the-money due to volatility $ \\sigma $, so the call’s sensitivity to $ S_0 $ is strictly less than $ 1 $ because it is governed by a standard-normal tail probability evaluated at a finite input. A higher $ r $ increases the risk-neutral drift, raises that input, and moves the sensitivity closer to $ 1 $, but it remains below $ 1 $ unless $ \\sigma \\to 0 $ or $ T \\to 0 $.**\n- This statement correctly identifies that the non-zero probability of expiring out-of-the-money (due to $ \\sigma > 0 $ and $ T > 0 $) is the reason why delta is less than $ 1 $. The delta, $ N(d_1) $, is indeed the value of the standard normal CDF at a finite input $ d_1 $. The reference to \"tail probability\" is conceptually sound, as $ N(d_1) = 1 - P(Z > d_1) $, where $ Z $ is a standard normal variable. The statement correctly describes the effect of a higher $ r $: it increases the risk-neutral drift, which increases the input $ d_1 $, and thus moves the delta $ N(d_1) $ closer to $ 1 $. Finally, it correctly states the conditions under which delta would reach $ 1 $. This option is fully consistent with the BSM model.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Static arbitrage requires every call option to have delta strictly less than $ 1 $ at positive maturities because the option price is discounted by $ e^{-rT} $, which forces the derivative of price with respect to $ S_0 $ to equal $ e^{-rT} $, independently of $ \\sigma $; therefore $ r $ mechanically keeps the delta away from $ 1 $.**\n- The statement that the derivative of the price with respect to $ S_0 $ (the delta) is forced to equal $ e^{-rT} $ is false. The delta is $ N(d_1) $, which is not generally equal to $ e^{-rT} $.\n- The claim that delta is independent of $ \\sigma $ is false. The parameter $ d_1 $ explicitly depends on $ \\sigma $.\n- The claim that $ r $ mechanically keeps the delta away from $ 1 $ is false. A higher $ r $ pushes the delta *closer* to $ 1 $.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. The call’s sensitivity equals the risk-neutral probability of expiring in-the-money based on the standard normal cumulative evaluated at a lower input that does not depend on $ r $, so the delta is less than $ 1 $ for finite $ T $, and $ r $ plays no role in determining it.**\n- The call's sensitivity (delta) is $ N(d_1) $. The risk-neutral probability of expiring in-the-money is $ N(d_2) $. These are not equal. This statement is factually incorrect.\n- The claim that the input for delta ($ d_1 $) does not depend on $ r $ is false. The formula for $ d_1 $ clearly contains $ r $.\n- The conclusion that $ r $ plays no role is therefore also false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. A deep in-the-money call can have a delta less than $ 1 $ only if $ r  0 $. If $ r  0 $, the risk-neutral drift dominates the diffusion for sufficiently deep in-the-money options at any positive maturity, forcing the delta to be exactly $ 1 $.**\n- The claim that delta can be less than $ 1 $ only if $ r  0 $ is false. For any finite parameters, including any $ r $, the delta is strictly less than $ 1 $ as long as $ \\sigma > 0 $ and $ T > 0 $.\n- The claim that delta is forced to be exactly $ 1 $ if $ r  0 $ is false. The stochastic component (diffusion) ensures that there is always a non-zero probability of the option expiring worthless, so delta remains strictly less than $ 1 $. The concept of drift \"dominating\" diffusion does not eliminate uncertainty.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nBased on the rigorous analysis of the BSM model and each option, Option A is the only one that provides a completely accurate and coherent explanation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2438282"}]}
