The derivation must be based on the Gärtner–Ellis theorem.

Let us define a scaling parameter $a(\\varepsilon)$ such that $a(\\varepsilon) \\to 0$ as $\\varepsilon \\to 0$.

We begin by computing the moment generating function (MGF) of $X_{\\varepsilon}$. Let $M_{X_{\\varepsilon}}(t) = \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(t X_{\\varepsilon})]$.\nThe MGF of a standard normal random variable $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ is $M_Z(s) = \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(sZ)] = \\exp(s^2/2)$.\nUsing this, the MGF of $X_{\\varepsilon}$ is:\n$$\nM_{X_{\\varepsilon}}(t) = \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(t(\\sqrt{\\varepsilon}Z))] = \\mathbb{E}[\\exp((t\\sqrt{\\varepsilon})Z)] = M_Z(t\\sqrt{\\varepsilon})\n$$\nSubstituting $s = t\\sqrt{\\varepsilon}$ into the formula for $M_Z(s)$, we get:\n$$\nM_{X_{\\varepsilon}}(t) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{(t\\sqrt{\\varepsilon})^2}{2}\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{t^2 \\varepsilon}{2}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we must identify the appropriate scaling $a(\\varepsilon)$ to define the SCGF. The choice of $a(\\varepsilon)$ is crucial; it must be chosen so that the limit $\\Lambda(k)$ is non-trivial (i.e., not always $0$ or $\\infty$).

We can obtain this by applying the contraction principle to the endpoint map $F: C([0, T], \\mathbb{R}) \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined by $F(\\phi) = \\phi(T)$. The contraction principle states that the rate function for the transformed variable is given by the infimum of the original rate function over the pre-image of the point.\n$$\nJ_T(x) = \\inf_{\\{\\phi \\in C([0,T], \\mathbb{R}) \\,|\\, \\phi(0)=x_0, \\phi(T)=x\\}} I_{x_0}(\\phi)\n$$\nThus, we must solve the following variational problem:\n$$\nJ_T(x) = \\inf \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\int_0^T (\\dot{\\phi}_t - k)^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}t \\mid \\phi \\in AC([0,T]), \\phi(0)=x_0, \\phi(T)=x \\right\\}\n$$\nThe infimum is over the set of absolutely continuous paths satisfying the boundary conditions. The integrand $L(\\dot{\\phi}) = (\\dot{\\phi} - k)^2$ does not depend on $\\phi$, so the Euler-Lagrange equation, $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\left(\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\dot{\\phi}}\\right) - \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\phi} = 0$, simplifies.

The velocity along this path is constant: $\\dot{\\phi}_t^* = \\frac{x-x_0}{T}$.\nSubstituting this optimal path back into the action functional gives the rate function $J_T(x)$:\n$$\nJ_T(x) = \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\int_0^T \\left(\\frac{x-x_0}{T} - k\\right)^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nSince the integrand is constant with respect to $t$, the integral is simply the integrand multiplied by $T$:\n$$\nJ_T(x) = \\frac{T}{2\\sigma^2} \\left(\\frac{x-x_0}{T} - k\\right)^2 = \\frac{T}{2\\sigma^2} \\left(\\frac{x-x_0-kT}{T}\\right)^2\n$$\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n$$\nJ_T(x) = \\frac{(x - (x_0 + kT))^2}{2\\sigma^2 T}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Verification via Exact Solution and Asymptotics**\n\nNext, we solve the SDE directly.

A \"downhill\" segment from the saddle point $x_s$ to the final minimum $x_b$, which follows the deterministic dynamics. This path $\\varphi_2$ satisfies $\\dot{\\varphi}_2(t) = b(\\varphi_2(t)) = -U'(\\varphi_2(t))$.\n\nThe total action is the sum of the actions over these two segments. Let us calculate each contribution.\n\nFor the second segment, from the saddle $x_s=0$ to the minimum $x_b=+1$, the path $\\varphi_2$ satisfies $\\dot{\\varphi}_2(t) = b(\\varphi_2(t))$. The action for this segment is:\n$$\nS(\\varphi_2) = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{t_s}^{t_b} \\big|\\dot{\\varphi}_2(t) - b(\\varphi_2(t))\\big|^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}t = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{t_s}^{t_b} \\big|b(\\varphi_2(t)) - b(\\varphi_2(t))\\big|^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}t = 0\n$$\n\nFor the first segment, from the minimum $x_a=-1$ to the saddle $x_s=0$, the path $\\varphi_1$ satisfies $\\dot{\\varphi}_1(t) = -b(\\varphi_1(t)) = +U'(\\varphi_1(t))$. The action is:\n$$\nS(\\varphi_1) = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{t_a}^{t_s} \\big|\\dot{\\varphi}_1(t) - b(\\varphi_1(t))\\big|^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}t = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{t_a}^{t_s} \\big|-b(\\varphi_1(t)) - b(\\varphi_1(t))\\big|^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}t = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{t_a}^{t_s} \\big|-2b(\\varphi_1(t))\\big|^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nSubstituting $b(\\varphi_1) = -U'(\\varphi_1)$, this becomes:\n$$\nS(\\varphi_1) = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_{t_a}^{t_s} \\big|2U'(\\varphi_1(t))\\big|^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}t = 2\\int_{t_a}^{t_s} \\left(U'(\\varphi_1(t))\\right)^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nWe can re-express the integrand using the equation for the path $\\dot{\\varphi}_1(t) = U'(\\varphi_1(t))$ and the chain rule for the potential $U(\\varphi_1(t))$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}U(\\varphi_1(t)) = U'(\\varphi_1(t)) \\cdot \\dot{\\varphi}_1(t) = U'(\\varphi_1(t)) \\cdot U'(\\varphi_1(t)) = \\left(U'(\\varphi_1(t))\\right)^{2}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the integral for the action:\n$$\nS(\\varphi_1) = 2\\int_{t_a}^{t_s} \\frac{d}{dt}U(\\varphi_1(t))\\,\\mathrm{d}t = 2\\Big[U(\\varphi_1(t))\\Big]_{t_a}^{t_s} = 2\\big(U(\\varphi_1(t_s)) - U(\\varphi_1(t_a))\\big)\n$$\nWith $\\varphi_1(t_a) = x_a = -1$ and $\\varphi_1(t_s) = x_s = 0$, the action for the uphill segment is:\n$$\nS(\\varphi_1) = 2\\big(U(0) - U(-1)\\big)\n$$\nThe total quasipotential is the sum of the actions for the two segments:\n$$\nV(-1, +1) = S(\\varphi_1) + S(\\varphi_2) = 2\\big(U(0) - U(-1)\\big) + 0 = 2\\big(U(0) - U(-1)\\big)\n$$\nThis confirms the general result that for a gradient system, the quasipotential to transition between two minima equals twice the potential energy difference between the separating saddle point and the initial minimum.\n\nNow, we compute the values of the potential at $x=-1$ and $x=0$:\n$$\nU(-1) = \\frac{((-1)^{2}-1)^{2}}{4} = \\frac{(1-1)^{2}}{4} = 0\n$$\n$$\nU(0) = \\frac{((0)^{2}-1)^{2}}{4} = \\frac{(-1)^{2}}{4} = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\nTherefore, the quasipotential is:\n$$\nV(-1, +1) = 2\\left(\\frac{1}{4} - 0\\right) = 2\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThe quasipotential for the transition from the left minimum at $x=-1$ to the right minimum at $x=+1$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "3055569"}]}
