The process $X_t$ is governed by the stochastic differential equation (SDE):\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}X_t = \\mathrm{d}B_t + \\mathrm{d}L_t\n$$\nHere, $B_t$ is a standard one-dimensional Brownian motion, and $L_t$ is the reflection term, which is a continuous, non-decreasing process with $L_0=0$ that increases only when $X_t=0$.\n\nWe are instructed to apply Itô's formula to the function $f(x) = x^2$. For a continuous semimartingale like $X_t$, Itô's formula states:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}f(X_t) = f'(X_t)\\mathrm{d}X_t + \\frac{1}{2}f''(X_t)\\mathrm{d}\\langle X \\rangle_t\n$$\nwhere $f'(x)$ and $f''(x)$ are the first and second derivatives of $f(x)$, and $\\langle X \\rangle_t$ is the quadratic variation process of $X_t$.\n\nFor $f(x) = x^2$, the derivatives are $f'(x) = 2x$ and $f''(x) = 2$. Substituting these into Itô's formula gives:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}(X_t^2) = 2X_t \\mathrm{d}X_t + \\frac{1}{2}(2)\\mathrm{d}\\langle X \\rangle_t = 2X_t \\mathrm{d}X_t + \\mathrm{d}\\langle X \\rangle_t\n$$\nNext, we substitute the SDE for $X_t$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}(X_t^2) = 2X_t(\\mathrm{d}B_t + \\mathrm{d}L_t) + \\mathrm{d}\\langle X \\rangle_t = 2X_t\\mathrm{d}B_t + 2X_t\\mathrm{d}L_t + \\mathrm{d}\\langle X \\rangle_t\n$$\nWe must now determine the quadratic variation $\\langle X \\rangle_t$. The process $X_t$ is the sum of $B_t$ and $L_t$. Using the properties of quadratic variation:\n$$\n\\langle X \\rangle_t = \\langle B + L \\rangle_t = \\langle B \\rangle_t + 2\\langle B, L \\rangle_t + \\langle L \\rangle_t\n$$\nThe quadratic variation of a standard Brownian motion is $\\langle B \\rangle_t = t$. The process $L_t$ is a continuous process of finite variation, and the quadratic variation of any such process is zero. Thus, $\\langle L \\rangle_t = 0$. The cross-variation $\\langle B, L \\rangle_t$ between a continuous local martingale (like $B_t$) and a continuous process of finite variation (like $L_t$) is also zero. Therefore, the quadratic variation of $X_t$ is:\n$$\n\\langle X \\rangle_t = t\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the SDE for $X_t^2$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}(X_t^2) = 2X_t\\mathrm{d}B_t + 2X_t\\mathrm{d}L_t + \\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nTo find $X_t^2$, we integrate this SDE from $0$ to $t$:\n$$\nX_t^2 - X_0^2 = \\int_0^t 2X_s \\mathrm{d}B_s + \\int_0^t 2X_s \\mathrm{d}L_s + \\int_0^t \\mathrm{d}s\n$$\nThe problem specifies that $L_t$ increases only on the set $\\{s \\in [0,t]: X_s = 0\\}$.

Consequently, the integrand $X_s$ is zero whenever $\\mathrm{d}L_s$ is non-zero. Therefore, the Stieltjes integral $\\int_0^t X_s \\mathrm{d}L_s$ is identically zero:\n$$\n\\int_0^t X_s \\mathrm{d}L_s = 0\n$$\nWith this simplification and substituting $X_0 = x$ and $\\int_0^t \\mathrm{d}s = t$, the equation for $X_t^2$ becomes:\n$$\nX_t^2 = x^2 + 2\\int_0^t X_s \\mathrm{d}B_s + t\n$$\nNow, we compute the expectation $\\mathbb{E}[X_t^2]$.

For the ball of radius $R$ centered at the origin, a point $y$ is on the boundary if $|y|=R$. The outward normal is $y/|y| = y/R$, so the inward normal is $n(y) = -y/R$.\n\nWe will use Itô's formula for semimartingales with a boundary term.

It is often written as $\\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial n}(X_{s}) dL_{s}$, where $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial n}$ is the normal derivative in the direction of reflection.\n\nTo find an expression for $L_{t}$, we must choose a suitable function $f$. The problem asks for a formula involving $|X_t|^2$, which suggests choosing the function $f(y) = |y|^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{d} y_i^2$. This function is twice continuously differentiable. We compute its gradient and Laplacian:\n- The gradient of $f$ is $\\nabla f(y) = 2y$.\n- The Laplacian of $f$ is $\\Delta f(y) = \\sum_{i=1}^{d} \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y_i^2} \\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{d} y_j^2\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{d} 2 = 2d$.\n\nNow we evaluate the boundary term integrand, $\\nabla f(X_s) \\cdot n(X_s)$.

This is a direct consequence of the rotational symmetry of both the domain (the ball) and our chosen function $f(y) = |y|^2$.

Let $X_t$ be RBM in $\\overline{B(0,R)}$ starting at $x$. Consider the scaled process $Y_{\\tau} = R^{-1} X_{R^2 \\tau}$. This process $Y_\\tau$ is a RBM in the unit ball $\\overline{B(0,1)}$ starting at $y=x/R$. The scaling property of Brownian motion implies that $\\tilde{W}_\\tau = R^{-1} W_{R^2\\tau}$ is a standard Brownian motion. The reflection term must also scale appropriately, which implies that the respective local times are related by $L_t^{(R)} = R L_{t/R^2}^{(1)}$, where the superscript indicates the radius. Our derived formula is consistent with this scaling, as shown by substituting the scaling relations into the formula for radius $R$ and showing it transforms into the formula for radius $1$.\n\nRegarding the dependence on $x$ and $t$: For small $t$, if $x$ is far from the boundary, $X_t$ is unlikely to have hit the boundary, so $\\mathbb{E}_x[L_t] \\approx 0$. In this case, $\\mathbb{E}_x[|X_t|^2] \\approx |x|^2 + d \\cdot t$ (as for a free Brownian motion), and our formula gives $\\mathbb{E}_x[L_t] \\approx \\frac{d \\cdot t + |x|^2 - (|x|^2+d \\cdot t)}{2R} = 0$, which is consistent.\nFor large $t$, the process $X_t$ approaches its stationary distribution, which is the uniform distribution on the ball $\\overline{B(0,R)}$. The memory of the initial state $x$ fades, and $\\mathbb{E}_x[|X_t|^2]$ converges to the constant value $\\mathbb{E}_{\\text{unif}}[|Y|^2]=\\frac{d}{d+2}R^2$.\n\nFinally, we identify the long-time rate of accumulation of local time. We divide by $t$ and take the limit as $t \\to \\infty$:\n$$ \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\mathbb{E}_{x}[L_{t}]}{t} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{d + |x|^2/t - \\mathbb{E}_{x}[|X_{t}|^2]/t}{2R} $$\nSince $|X_t|^2 \\le R^2$, the term $\\mathbb{E}_{x}[|X_{t}|^2]/t$ goes to $0$ as $t \\to \\infty$. The term $|x|^2/t$ also goes to $0$. Thus, the limit is:\n$$ \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\mathbb{E}_{x}[L_{t}]}{t} = \\frac{d}{2R} $$\nThis indicates that, in the long run, the local time accumulates at a constant average rate of $d/(2R)$, independent of the starting position $x$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{d \\cdot t + |x|^{2} - \\mathbb{E}_{x}[|X_{t}|^{2}]}{2R}}\n$$", "id": "3073660"}, {"introduction": "The local time process $L_t$ is a central, yet abstract, concept in the study of reflected SDEs.

Construction of the Estimator for Local Time $L_t$**\n\nThe problem requires constructing an estimator for the Skorokhod local time $L_t$ from first principles, including the use of Tanaka's formula and the concept of occupation density.\n\nFor a continuous semimartingale $Y_t$, the symmetric local time at a point $a$, denoted $L_t^a(Y)$, is given by the Itô-Tanaka formula:\n$$|Y_t-a| - |Y_0-a| = \\int_0^t \\text{sgn}(Y_s-a) dY_s + L_t^a(Y)$$\nwhere $\\text{sgn}(0)=0$. The local time $L_t^a(Y)$ is also the density of the occupation measure with respect to the quadratic variation process, which for a reflected Brownian motion $X_t$ (where $\\langle X \\rangle_t = t$) gives the occupation time formula:\n$$L_t^a(X) = \\lim_{\\varepsilon\\downarrow 0} \\frac{1}{2\\varepsilon} \\int_0^t \\mathbf{1}_{(a-\\varepsilon, a+\\varepsilon)}(X_s) ds$$\nSince $X_t$ is non-negative, the local time at the boundary $a=0$ becomes:\n$$L_t^0(X) = \\lim_{\\varepsilon\\downarrow 0} \\frac{1}{2\\varepsilon} \\int_0^t \\mathbf{1}_{[0, \\varepsilon)}(X_s) ds$$\nThe crucial step is to relate the Skorokhod local time $L_t$ to the symmetric local time $L_t^0(X)$. For a reflected Brownian motion on $[0, \\infty)$, the correct relationship is $L_t = L_t^0(X)$. While a formal derivation using Tanaka's formula on $X_t$ can be subtle due to boundary effects, this identity is a fundamental result in the theory.\n\nThis relationship provides the principle for constructing our estimator. The integral $\\int_0^t \\mathbf{1}_{[0, \\varepsilon)}(X_s) ds$ represents the time the process $X_t$ spends in the interval $[0, \\varepsilon)$. We can approximate this integral using the discrete observations:\n$$\\int_0^t \\mathbf{1}_{[0, \\varepsilon)}(X_s) ds \\approx \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\mathbf{1}_{\\{X_{k\\Delta} \\in [0, \\varepsilon)\\}} \\Delta$$\nBased on the formula for $L_t^0(X)$, the estimator for $L_t$ is constructed by applying the correct normalization factor $1/(2\\varepsilon)$. Thus, our proposed estimator is:\n$$\\hat{L}_{t,n,\\varepsilon} = \\frac{1}{2\\varepsilon} \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\mathbf{1}_{\\{X_{k\\Delta} \\in [0, \\varepsilon)\\}} \\Delta$$\n\n**2.2.

This requires evaluating $\\lim_{\\varepsilon \\downarrow 0} \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} \\mathbb{P}(X_s \\in [0, \\varepsilon))$. Let $p_s(x)$ be the probability density function (PDF) of $X_s$. Then $\\mathbb{P}(X_s \\in [0, \\varepsilon)) = \\int_0^\\varepsilon p_s(x) dx$. By the fundamental theorem of calculus (or L'Hôpital's rule):\n$$\\lim_{\\varepsilon \\downarrow 0} \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} \\int_0^\\varepsilon p_s(x) dx = p_s(0)$$\nAssuming we can interchange the limit and integral (which is justified by dominated convergence), the limiting expectation of our estimator is:\n$$\\lim_{\\varepsilon \\downarrow 0} \\lim_{\\Delta \\to 0} \\mathbb{E}[\\hat{L}_{t,n,\\varepsilon}] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^t p_s(0) ds$$\nThe process $X_t$ started at $X_0=0$ has the same distribution as $|W_t|$, where $W_t$ is a standard Brownian motion. The PDF of $W_s \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, s)$ is $\\phi_s(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi s}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2s}\\right)$. The PDF of $X_s \\sim |W_s|$ for $x \\ge 0$ is $p_s(x) = 2\\phi_s(x) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2\\pi s}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2s}\\right) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi s}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2s}\\right)$.\nAt the boundary $x=0$, the density is $p_s(0) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi s}}$.\nPlugging this into our integral:\n$$\\lim_{\\varepsilon \\downarrow 0, \\Delta \\to 0} \\mathbb{E}[\\hat{L}_{t,n,\\varepsilon}] = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^t \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi s}} ds = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}} \\int_0^t s^{-1/2} ds$$\n$$\\lim_{\\varepsilon \\downarrow 0, \\Delta \\to 0} \\mathbb{E}[\\hat{L}_{t,n,\\varepsilon}] = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}} \\left[2s^{1/2}\\right]_0^t = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}} (2\\sqrt{t}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2t}{\\pi}}$$\n\n**2.3. Verification via Theoretical Expectation of $L_t$**\n\nWe must verify this result by computing the theoretical expectation of the Skorokhod local time $L_t$. For a reflected Brownian motion starting from $X_0=0$, the process $X_t$ and local time $L_t$ in the decomposition $X_t = W_t + L_t$ can be constructed as $L_t = \\max_{0 \\le s \\le t}(-W_s)$ and $X_t = W_t + \\max_{0 \\le s \\le t}(-W_s)$.\n\nAn important theorem by Paul Lévy states that the process $M_t = \\max_{0 \\le s \\le t} W_s$ has the same distribution as $|W_t|$. Since $-W_s$ is also a standard Brownian motion, $L_t = \\max_{0 \\le s \\le t}(-W_s)$ has the same distribution as $|W_t|$.\nTherefore, their expectations are equal:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[L_t] = \\mathbb{E}[|W_t|]$$\nTo compute $\\mathbb{E}[|W_t|]$, let $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$. Then $W_t = \\sqrt{t} Z$.\n$$\\mathbb{E}[|W_t|] = \\mathbb{E}[|\\sqrt{t}Z|] = \\sqrt{t} \\mathbb{E}[|Z|]$$\nThe expectation of the absolute value of a standard normal random variable is:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[|Z|] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |z| \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-z^2/2} dz = 2 \\int_0^{\\infty} z \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-z^2/2} dz$$\n$$\\mathbb{E}[|Z|] = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}} \\int_0^{\\infty} z e^{-z^2/2} dz = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}} \\left[-e^{-z^2/2}\\right]_0^\\infty = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}}(0 - (-1)) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}}$$\nSubstituting this back, we find the theoretical expectation of the local time:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[L_t] = \\sqrt{t} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\pi}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2t}{\\pi}}$$\n\nThe limiting expectation of our constructed estimator, $\\sqrt{\\frac{2t}{\\pi}}$, matches the theoretical expectation of the local time $L_t$. This confirms that our estimator is asymptotically unbiased and that the normalization factor $1/(2\\varepsilon)$ is correct.\n\nThe final answer is the derived closed-form expression for this limit.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\sqrt{\\frac{2t}{\\pi}}} $$", "id": "3073657"}]}
