It is scientifically grounded in the theory of stochastic differential equations, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and stated in objective, unambiguous terms.\n\nWe are asked to find the mean first exit time, $\\mathbb{E}_x[\\tau]$, for a particle undergoing Brownian motion from the open interval $(0,1)$. The motion is described by the one-dimensional stochastic differential equation (SDE):\n$$dX_t = \\sqrt{2}\\,dW_t$$\nwith an initial position $X_0 = x \\in (0,1)$. The exit time $\\tau$ is defined as $\\tau = \\inf\\{t \\ge 0: X_t \\notin (0,1)\\}$. Let $u(x) = \\mathbb{E}_x[\\tau]$ denote the mean exit time as a function of the starting position $x$.\n\nThe problem suggests using the concept of an infinitesimal generator. The generator $\\mathcal{L}$ of a general time-homogeneous Itô process $dX_t = b(X_t)dt + \\sigma(X_t)dW_t$ acting on a sufficiently smooth function $f(x)$ is given by:\n$$\\mathcal{L}f(x) = b(x)\\frac{df}{dx} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma(x)^2\\frac{d^2f}{dx^2}$$\nFor the given SDE, the drift coefficient is $b(x) = 0$ and the diffusion coefficient is $\\sigma(x) = \\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, the infinitesimal generator is:\n$$\\mathcal{L}f(x) = (0)\\frac{df}{dx} + \\frac{1}{2}(\\sqrt{2})^2\\frac{d^2f}{dx^2} = \\frac{1}{2}(2)\\frac{d^2f}{dx^2} = \\frac{d^2f}{dx^2}$$\nSo, for our specific process, the generator $\\mathcal{L}$ is simply the second derivative operator, $\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{d^2}{dx^2}$.\n\nTo find $u(x)$, we use a fundamental result that connects the mean exit time to the generator, which can be derived from Dynkin's formula. Dynkin's formula states that for a suitable function $f$ and a stopping time $\\tau$ with finite expectation,\n$$\\mathbb{E}_x[f(X_\\tau)] - f(x) = \\mathbb{E}_x\\left[\\int_0^\\tau (\\mathcal{L}f)(X_s) ds\\right]$$\nThe key step is to recognize that the mean exit time $u(x)$ itself satisfies the Poisson equation $\\mathcal{L}u(x) = -1$ inside the domain, with boundary conditions reflecting that the exit time is zero if starting on the boundary. We can prove this relationship using Dynkin's formula. Let us assume that our mean exit time function $u(x)$ is twice continuously differentiable and solves the boundary value problem:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}u(x) = -1, \\quad x \\in (0,1) $$\n$$ u(x) = 0, \\quad x \\in \\{0, 1\\} $$\nNow, let's substitute $f(x) = u(x)$ into Dynkin's formula:\n$$\\mathbb{E}_x[u(X_\\tau)] - u(x) = \\mathbb{E}_x\\left[\\int_0^\\tau (\\mathcal{L}u)(X_s) ds\\right]$$\nBy definition of the exit time $\\tau$, the process stops when $X_\\tau$ reaches the boundary $\\{0,1\\}$. According to our proposed boundary conditions, $u(0)=0$ and $u(1)=0$. Thus, $u(X_\\tau) = 0$. The left side of the equation becomes:\n$$\\mathbb{E}_x[0] - u(x) = -u(x)$$\nFor the right side, we use our assumption that $\\mathcal{L}u(x) = -1$ for all $x$ in the domain. So, $(\\mathcal{L}u)(X_s) = -1$ for all $s < \\tau$. The integral becomes:\n$$\\mathbb{E}_x\\left[\\int_0^\\tau (-1) ds\\right] = \\mathbb{E}_x\\left[-s\\right]_0^\\tau = \\mathbb{E}_x[-\\tau] = -\\mathbb{E}_x[\\tau]$$\nEquating the transformed left and right sides of Dynkin's formula gives:\n$$-u(x) = -\\mathbb{E}_x[\\tau]$$\nThis confirms that if we find the function $u(x)$ that solves the specified boundary value problem, it will be the mean exit time, i.e., $u(x) = \\mathbb{E}_x[\\tau]$.\n\nWe now solve the boundary value problem. Substituting the specific generator $\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{d^2}{dx^2}$, the problem becomes:\n$$u''(x) = -1 \\quad \\text{for } x \\in (0,1)$$\nwith boundary conditions:\n$$u(0) = 0$$\n$$u(1) = 0$$\nWe solve this second-order ordinary differential equation by integrating twice with respect to $x$. The first integration yields:\n$$u'(x) = \\int -1 \\, dx = -x + C_1$$\nwhere $C_1$ is a constant of integration. Integrating a second time gives:\n$$u(x) = \\int (-x + C_1) \\, dx = -\\frac{x^2}{2} + C_1 x + C_2$$\nwhere $C_2$ is a second constant of integration. We determine the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ using the boundary conditions.\nApplying the condition $u(0)=0$:\n$$u(0) = -\\frac{0^2}{2} + C_1(0) + C_2 = 0 \\implies C_2 = 0$$\nThe solution simplifies to $u(x) = -\\frac{x^2}{2} + C_1 x$. Now, applying the second condition $u(1)=0$:\n$$u(1) = -\\frac{1^2}{2} + C_1(1) = 0 \\implies -\\frac{1}{2} + C_1 = 0 \\implies C_1 = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nSubstituting the values of $C_1$ and $C_2$ back into the general solution, we obtain the exact expression for the mean exit time:\n$$u(x) = -\\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}x$$\nThis can be written in a factored form:\n$$u(x) = \\frac{x(1-x)}{2}$$\nThe problem asks to confirm that $\\mathbb{E}_x[\\tau]$ depends quadratically on $x$. Our derived expression for $u(x) = \\mathbb{E}_x[\\tau]$ is $u(x) = -\\frac{1}{2}x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}x$, which is a polynomial of degree $2$ in $x$.
