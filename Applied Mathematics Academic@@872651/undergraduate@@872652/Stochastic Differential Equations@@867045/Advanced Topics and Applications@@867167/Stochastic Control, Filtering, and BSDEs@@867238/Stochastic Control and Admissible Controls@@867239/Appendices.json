It presents a non-trivial scenario to probe the distinctions between fundamental concepts.\n\nThe problem requires completing four tasks. We will address them in sequence.\n\nTo begin, we recall the key definitions:\n- A stochastic process $(X_t)_{t \\in [0,1]}$ is **$(\\mathcal{F}_t)$-adapted** if for every $t \\in [0,1]$, the random variable $X_t: \\Omega \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable. This means that for any Borel set $B \\in \\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R})$, the pre-image $\\{ \\omega \\in \\Omega : X_t(\\omega) \\in B \\}$ is in the sigma-algebra $\\mathcal{F}_t$.\n- A stochastic process $(X_t)_{t \\in [0,1]}$ is **progressively measurable** with respect to $(\\mathcal{F}_t)$ if for every $T \\in [0,1]$, the map $(t, \\omega) \\mapsto X_t(\\omega)$ from $[0,T] \\times \\Omega$ to $\\mathbb{R}$ is $\\mathcal{B}([0,T]) \\otimes \\mathcal{F}_T$-measurable. Here, $\\mathcal{B}([0,T])$ denotes the Borel $\\sigma$-algebra on the interval $[0,T]$.\n\nThe process under consideration is $u_t(\\omega) = \\mathbf{1}_{A}(t)$, where $A \\subset [0,1]$ is a Lebesgue measurable set that is not Borel measurable. This process is deterministic, as its value depends only on the time parameter $t$ and not on the outcome $\\omega \\in \\Omega$.\n\n**1. Proof that $u$ is $(\\mathcal{F}_t)$-adapted**\n\nTo prove that the process $u = (u_t)_{t \\in [0,1]}$ is $(\\mathcal{F}_t)$-adapted, we must show that for any fixed $t_0 \\in [0,1]$, the random variable $u_{t_0}$ is $\\mathcal{F}_{t_0}$-measurable.\n\nFor a fixed $t_0 \\in [0,1]$, the value of $u_{t_0}(\\omega) = \\mathbf{1}_{A}(t_0)$ is a constant for all $\\omega \\in \\Omega$. Specifically, $u_{t_0}(\\omega)$ is either $1$ (if $t_0 \\in A$) or $0$ (if $t_0 \\notin A$). Let this constant value be $c$, where $c \\in \\{0, 1\\}$.\n\nA constant function $f(\\omega) = c$ is a random variable. To check its measurability with respect to a $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{G}$, we must verify that for any Borel set $B \\in \\mathcal{B}(\\mathbb{R})$, the pre-image $f^{-1}(B) = \\{\\omega \\in \\Omega : f(\\omega) \\in B\\}$ is in $\\mathcal{G}$.\n- If $c \\in B$, the pre-image is the entire sample space $\\Omega$.\n- If $c \\notin B$, the pre-image is the empty set $\\emptyset$.\n\nBy definition, any $\\sigma$-algebra on $\\Omega$, including $\\mathcal{F}_{t_0}$ for any $t_0 \\in [0,1]$, must contain both $\\emptyset$ and $\\Omega$. Therefore, for any Borel set $B$, the pre-image of $B$ under $u_{t_0}$ is in $\\mathcal{F}_{t_0}$. This confirms that the random variable $u_{t_0}$ is $\\mathcal{F}_{t_0}$-measurable for every $t_0 \\in [0,1]$.\n\nConsequently, the process $u = (u_t)_{t \\in [0,1]}$ is $(\\mathcal{F}_t)$-adapted. This holds true for any deterministic process.\n\n**2. Proof that $u$ is not progressively measurable**\n\nTo prove that $u$ is not progressively measurable, we must show that there exists some $T \\in [0,1]$ for which the map $(t,\\omega) \\mapsto u_t(\\omega)$ on $[0,T] \\times \\Omega$ is not $\\mathcal{B}([0,T]) \\otimes \\mathcal{F}_T$-measurable.\n\nLet us choose $T=1$. We must examine the measurability of the map $(t,\\omega) \\mapsto \\mathbf{1}_{A}(t)$ from $[0,1] \\times \\Omega$ into $\\mathbb{R}$ with respect to the product $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{B}([0,1]) \\otimes \\mathcal{F}_1$.\n\nA general result states that a function $f(t,\\omega) = g(t)$ that depends only on the first variable $t$ is measurable with respect to a product $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{G}_t \\otimes \\mathcal{G}_\\omega$ if and only if $g$ is $\\mathcal{G}_t$-measurable (assuming $\\mathcal{G}_\\omega$ contains $\\Omega$). Applying this to our case, the map $(t,\\omega) \\mapsto \\mathbf{1}_{A}(t)$ is $\\mathcal{B}([0,1]) \\otimes \\mathcal{F}_1$-measurable if and only if the function $t \\mapsto \\mathbf{1}_{A}(t)$ is $\\mathcal{B}([0,1])$-measurable.\n\nA function is $\\mathcal{B}([0,1])$-measurable, or Borel measurable, if the pre-image of every Borel set in its codomain is a Borel set in its domain. For the indicator function $\\mathbf{1}_{A}$, let's consider the pre-image of the singleton set $\\{1\\}$, which is a Borel set in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n$$ \\{ t \\in [0,1] : \\mathbf{1}_{A}(t) \\in \\{1\\} \\} = \\{ t \\in [0,1] : \\mathbf{1}_{A}(t) = 1 \\} = A $$\nFor the function $t \\mapsto \\mathbf{1}_{A}(t)$ to be Borel measurable, the set $A$ must be a Borel measurable subset of $[0,1]$. However, the problem statement explicitly gives that $A$ is **not a Borel measurable set**.\n\nTherefore, the function $t \\mapsto \\mathbf{1}_{A}(t)$ is not Borel measurable. This implies that the map $(t, \\omega) \\mapsto u_t(\\omega)$ is not $\\mathcal{B}([0,1]) \\otimes \\mathcal{F}_1$-measurable. Thus, the process $u$ is not progressively measurable.\n\n**3. The role of progressive measurability for stochastic integrals**\n\nThe standard theory of Itô stochastic integration for an integrand process $\\phi = (\\phi_t)_{t \\in [0,T]}$ requires that the integral $\\int_0^T \\phi_t^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}t$ be a well-defined random variable and, typically, that its expectation $\\mathbb{E}[\\int_0^T \\phi_t^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}t]$ be finite. The construction of the Itô integral $\\int_0^T \\phi_t \\, \\mathrm{d}W_t$ relies on an approximation procedure where $\\phi$ is approached by a sequence of \"simple\" processes. This procedure takes place in the Hilbert space $L^2([0,T] \\times \\Omega, \\mathcal{B}([0,T]) \\otimes \\mathcal{F}, \\lambda \\otimes \\mathbb{P})$.\n\nFor a process $\\phi$ to be an element of this space, the map $(t,\\omega) \\mapsto \\phi_t(\\omega)$ must be measurable with respect to the product $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{B}([0,T]) \\otimes \\mathcal{F}$. The process $u_t = \\mathbf{1}_A(t)$ from this problem fails this condition, as we showed it is not $\\mathcal{B}([0,1]) \\otimes \\mathcal{F}_1$-measurable. Consequently, it lies outside the standard domain of the Itô integral, and an integral like $\\int_0^1 u_t \\, \\mathrm{d}W_t$ is not defined by the standard construction.\n\nProgressive measurability is a condition stronger than just being in this $L^2$ space. It requires measurability of the restricted process on $[0,T_0]$ with respect to $\\mathcal{B}([0,T_0]) \\otimes \\mathcal{F}_{T_0}$ for *all* $T_0 \\le T$. This stronger condition is crucial for ensuring that the resulting integral process, $I_t = \\int_0^t \\phi_s \\, \\mathrm{d}W_s$, is itself $(\\mathcal{F}_t)$-adapted. The adaptedness of the integral process is a cornerstone of stochastic calculus, reflecting the non-anticipating nature of the integral; the value of the integral up to time $t$ must be determined solely by information available up to time $t$.\n\nMere adaptedness, as demonstrated by the process $u_t$, is insufficient. Adaptedness is a pointwise-in-time condition on each random variable $u_t$ but imposes no joint-measurability structure on the process as a function of $(t,\\omega)$. Without this joint measurability, which progressive measurability enforces in a way compatible with the flow of information, the fundamental machinery of integration theory cannot be applied to define the integral and prove its essential properties.\n\n**4. Computation of the cost functional**\n\nThe cost functional is defined as $J(u) := \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\int_{0}^{1} u_t^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}t\\right]$.\nFirst, we analyze the integrand inside the expectation. The process is $u_t = \\mathbf{1}_A(t)$, so its square is $u_t^2 = (\\mathbf{1}_A(t))^2$. Since an indicator function only takes values $0$ and $1$, squaring it does not change its value.\n$$ u_t^2 = \\mathbf{1}_A(t) $$\nThe integral inside the expectation is a Lebesgue integral with respect to the time variable $t$:\n$$ \\int_0^1 u_t^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}t = \\int_0^1 \\mathbf{1}_A(t) \\, \\mathrm{d}t $$\nThe problem states that $A$ is a Lebesgue measurable set. The function $t \\mapsto \\mathbf{1}_A(t)$ is therefore a Lebesgue measurable function. By the definition of the Lebesgue integral, the integral of an indicator function of a measurable set is equal to the measure of that set.\n$$ \\int_0^1 \\mathbf{1}_A(t) \\, \\mathrm{d}t = \\lambda(A) $$\nwhere $\\lambda$ denotes the Lebesgue measure on $[0,1]$.\nThe problem provides the value $\\lambda(A) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nTherefore, the integral is a deterministic constant:\n$$ \\int_0^1 u_t^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}t = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nNow, we compute the expectation of this constant value:\n$$ J(u) = \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\right] $$\nThe expectation of a constant is the constant itself.\n$$ J(u) = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThe final answer is the value of this cost functional.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "3076990"}, {"introduction": "Having an optimal solution seems like a reasonable expectation, but in the world of control theory, this is not always guaranteed within the most intuitive set of controls.

The integrand $|X_t|$ is always non-negative, so $J(u) \\ge 0$ for any control $u$. The infimum is therefore also non-negative.\n\nTo find the value of the infimum, we construct a sequence of \"chattering\" controls, $\\{u_n\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}}$, that cause the state $X_t$ to oscillate rapidly around $0$. For each integer $n \\ge 1$, define the control $u_n(t)$ to alternate between $+1$ and $-1$ on intervals of length $\\epsilon_n = \\frac{T}{2n}$:\n$$\nu_n(t) = \\begin{cases} +1  \\text{if } t \\in [k \\cdot 2\\epsilon_n, (k \\cdot 2 + 1)\\epsilon_n) \\\\ -1  \\text{if } t \\in [(k \\cdot 2 + 1)\\epsilon_n, (k \\cdot 2 + 2)\\epsilon_n) \\end{cases}\n$$\nfor $k = 0, 1, \\dots, n-1$, with the last interval closed at $T$.\n\nLet's analyze the trajectory $X_t^{(n)}$ corresponding to $u_n(t)$.\nFor $t \\in [0, \\epsilon_n]$, $X_t^{(n)} = \\int_0^t 1 ds = t$. The maximum value is $X_{\\epsilon_n}^{(n)} = \\epsilon_n$.\nFor $t \\in [\\epsilon_n, 2\\epsilon_n]$, $X_t^{(n)} = X_{\\epsilon_n}^{(n)} + \\int_{\\epsilon_n}^t (-1) ds = \\epsilon_n - (t - \\epsilon_n) = 2\\epsilon_n - t$. At $t=2\\epsilon_n$, $X_{2\\epsilon_n}^{(n)} = 0$.\nThe trajectory from $t=0$ to $t=2\\epsilon_n$ forms a triangular pulse with height $\\epsilon_n$ and base $2\\epsilon_n$. This pattern repeats $n$ times over the interval $[0, T]$. The maximum value of $|X_t^{(n)}|$ on $[0,T]$ is $\\epsilon_n = \\frac{T}{2n}$.\n\nThe cost for the control $u_n(t)$ is the sum of the areas of these $n$ triangles:\n$$\nJ(u_n) = \\int_0^T |X_t^{(n)}|\\,dt = n \\times \\left(\\text{Area of one triangle}\\right)\n$$\nThe area of one triangle is $\\int_0^{2\\epsilon_n} |X_t^{(n)}|\\,dt = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} (2\\epsilon_n)(\\epsilon_n) = \\epsilon_n^2$.\nSo, the total cost is:\n$$\nJ(u_n) = n \\cdot \\epsilon_n^2 = n \\left(\\frac{T}{2n}\\right)^2 = n \\frac{T^2}{4n^2} = \\frac{T^2}{4n}\n$$\nAs we let $n \\to \\infty$, the cost approaches zero:\n$$\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} J(u_n) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{T^2}{4n} = 0\n$$\nSince we have found a sequence of admissible controls whose cost approaches $0$, and we know $J(u) \\ge 0$, we can conclude that the infimum is $0$:\n$$\n\\inf_{u \\in \\mathcal{U}_{ord}} J(u) = 0\n$$\nNow, we must show that no ordinary admissible control can actually attain this value. For a cost of $0$ to be achieved, we must have $J(u) = \\int_0^T |X_t| dt = 0$.\nThe state $X_t = \\int_0^t u_s ds$ is an absolutely continuous function of $t$, and thus continuous. The function $t \\mapsto |X_t|$ is therefore also continuous and non-negative. For the integral of a non-negative continuous function to be zero, the function itself must be identically zero. That is:\n$$\n|X_t| = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad X_t = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } t \\in [0, T]\n$$\nIf $X_t = \\int_0^t u_s ds = 0$ for all $t \\in [0,T]$, then its derivative with respect to $t$ must be zero. By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus for Lebesgue integrals, this implies $\\dot{X}_t = u_t = 0$ for almost every $t \\in [0,T]$.\nHowever, the set of ordinary admissible controls is defined such that $u_t$ must take values in $U = \\{-1, 1\\}$. The value $0$ is not in this set. A measurable function $u_t: [0, T] \\to \\{-1, 1\\}$ cannot be equal to $0$ on a set of positive measure, let alone almost everywhere.\nThis creates a contradiction. Therefore, there exists no ordinary admissible control $u_t$ that can make $X_t$ identically zero, and thus no ordinary control can achieve the infimum cost of $0$. We conclude that an optimal control does not exist in the space of ordinary admissible controls.\n\n### Part 2: Existence of an Optimal Relaxed Control\n\nA relaxed control is a process $\\mu_t$ taking values in the set of probability measures on $U$. The relaxed state dynamics are given by:\n$$\ndX_t = \\left(\\int_U u\\,\\mu_t(du)\\right) dt, \\quad X_0 = 0\n$$\nLet's denote the effective control as $v_t = \\int_U u\\,\\mu_t(du)$. A probability measure $\\mu_t$ on $U=\\{-1,1\\}$ can be written as $\\mu_t = \\alpha_t \\delta_{1} + (1-\\alpha_t)\\delta_{-1}$ for some measurable process $\\alpha_t \\in [0,1]$, where $\\delta_c$ is the Dirac measure at point $c$. The effective control is then:\n$$\nv_t = (+1)\\alpha_t + (-1)(1-\\alpha_t) = 2\\alpha_t - 1\n$$\nAs $\\alpha_t$ ranges over $[0,1]$, $v_t$ ranges over the interval $[-1,1]$. This interval is the convex hull of the original control set $U$, i.e., $v_t \\in \\text{conv}(U) = [-1,1]$. The relaxed control problem is thus equivalent to finding a measurable control function $v_t: [0,T] \\to [-1,1]$ that minimizes $J(v) = \\int_0^T |X_t| dt$ with $X_t = \\int_0^t v_s ds$.\n\nThe infimum of the cost is still $0$. We seek a relaxed control that achieves this value. As established before, a cost of $0$ requires $X_t = 0$ for all $t$, which in turn requires the effective control to be $v_t = 0$ for almost every $t \\in [0,T]$.\nThe control $v_t = 0$ is an admissible relaxed control, since $0 \\in [-1,1]$. With this control, the state trajectory is $X_t = \\int_0^t 0 \\,ds = 0$ for all $t$. The cost is $J(v) = \\int_0^T |0| dt = 0$.\nSince this control achieves the infimum value of $0$, it is an optimal relaxed control.\n\nTo exhibit the optimal relaxed control $\\mu_t$, we must find $\\alpha_t$ such that $v_t = 2\\alpha_t - 1 = 0$. This gives $\\alpha_t = 1/2$. The optimal choice for $\\alpha_t$ is a constant function $\\alpha_t = 1/2$ for all $t \\in [0,T]$.\nThis corresponds to the relaxed control process $\\mu_t^*$ which is constant in time:\n$$\n\\mu_t^* = \\frac{1}{2}\\delta_{1} + \\frac{1}{2}\\delta_{-1}, \\quad \\text{for all } t \\in [0,T]\n$$\nThis control is progressively measurable (as it is constant) and takes values in the set of probability measures on $U$. It is therefore an optimal relaxed control. This control represents an infinitely fast chattering between the values $-1$ and $1$, spending equal time at each.\n\n### Part 3: Minimal Value of the Performance Criterion\n\nThe optimal relaxed control policy $v_t = 0$ for $t \\in [0,T]$ yields the state trajectory $X_t = 0$ for all $t \\in [0,T]$.\nThe minimal value of the performance criterion is the value of $J(u)$ evaluated for this optimal policy:\n$$\n\\min J = J(\\mu_t^*) = \\int_0^T |X_t^*|\\,dt = \\int_0^T |0|\\,dt = 0\n$$\nThe minimal value of the performance criterion is $0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "3077006"}, {"introduction": "Often, a seemingly complex stochastic control problem can be simplified by a clever application of fundamental principles.

A property of Wiener integrals is that they are Gaussian random variables.\n    The mean of the increment is\n    $$\\mathbb{E}[W_t - W_s] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_s^t u_r \\, \\mathrm{d}B_r\\right] = 0,$$\n    which is a general property of Itô integrals.\n    The variance of the increment is calculated using the Itô isometry property for deterministic integrands:\n    $$\\mathrm{Var}(W_t - W_s) = \\mathbb{E}\\left[(W_t - W_s)^2\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\int_s^t u_r \\, \\mathrm{d}B_r\\right)^2\\right] = \\int_s^t u_r^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}r.$$\n    Given that $u_r \\in \\{-1, 1\\}$, we have $u_r^2 = 1$ for all $r$. Therefore,\n    $$\\mathrm{Var}(W_t - W_s) = \\int_s^t 1^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}r = \\int_s^t 1 \\, \\mathrm{d}r = t - s.$$\n    So, the increment $W_t - W_s$ is a normally distributed random variable with mean $0$ and variance $t-s$.\n\n4.  **Independent increments**:\n    Consider two disjoint time intervals $[r,s)$ and $[t,v)$ with $0 \\leq r  s \\leq t  v$. The corresponding increments are\n    $$W_s - W_r = \\int_r^s u_q \\, \\mathrm{d}B_q \\quad \\text{and} \\quad W_v - W_t = \\int_t^v u_q \\, \\mathrm{d}B_q.$$\n    The Itô integral over an interval $[a,b]$ is an element of the sigma-algebra generated by the increments of the underlying Brownian motion $B_q$ for $q \\in [a,b]$. Thus, $W_s - W_r$ is measurable with respect to the sigma-algebra $\\mathcal{F}_{[r,s]} = \\sigma(B_q - B_r : r \\leq q \\leq s)$, and $W_v - W_t$ is measurable with respect to $\\mathcal{F}_{[t,v]} = \\sigma(B_q - B_t : t \\leq q \\leq v)$. By the definition of a standard Brownian motion, its increments over disjoint intervals are independent. This implies that the sigma-algebras $\\mathcal{F}_{[r,s]}$ and $\\mathcal{F}_{[t,v]}$ are independent. Consequently, the random variables $W_s - W_r$ and $W_v - W_t$ are independent.\n\nAll four properties of a standard Brownian motion have been verified. Thus, for any admissible control $u$, the process $W_t$ is a standard $(\\mathcal{F}_t)$-Brownian motion. This is a special case of a more general result related to Lévy's characterization of Brownian motion.\n\n**Task B: Minimization of the Cost Functional**\n\nThe cost functional is given by\n$$J(u) := \\rho \\int_0^T u_t \\, \\mathrm{d}t + \\gamma \\, \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[X_T^{2}\\right],$$\nwhere $\\rho  0$ and $\\gamma  0$ are constants. The state process $X_t$ follows the stochastic differential equation (SDE):\n$$\\mathrm{d}X_t = \\mu \\, \\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma \\, \\mathrm{d}W_t, \\quad X_0 = 0,$$\nwith constants $\\mu  0$ and $\\sigma  0$.\n\nWe can find an explicit expression for $X_T$ by integrating the SDE from $t=0$ to $t=T$:\n$$X_T - X_0 = \\int_0^T \\mu \\, \\mathrm{d}t + \\int_0^T \\sigma \\, \\mathrm{d}W_t.$$\nSince $X_0 = 0$, we have\n$$X_T = \\mu T + \\sigma \\int_0^T \\mathrm{d}W_t = \\mu T + \\sigma W_T.$$\nNow, we must compute the expectation of the square of $X_T$, i.e., $\\mathbb{E}[X_T^2]$. From Task A, we know that for any admissible control $u$, the process $W_t$ is a standard Brownian motion. This implies that the distribution of $W_T$ is independent of the choice of $u$. Specifically, $W_T$ is a normal random variable with mean $0$ and variance $T$, i.e., $W_T \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,T)$.\n\nThe mean of $X_T$ is\n$$\\mathbb{E}[X_T] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mu T + \\sigma W_T] = \\mu T + \\sigma \\mathbb{E}[W_T] = \\mu T + \\sigma \\cdot 0 = \\mu T.$$\nThe variance of $X_T$ is\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(X_T) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\mu T + \\sigma W_T) = \\mathrm{Var}(\\sigma W_T) = \\sigma^2 \\mathrm{Var}(W_T) = \\sigma^2 T.$$\nUsing the identity $\\mathbb{E}[X_T^2] = \\mathrm{Var}(X_T) + (\\mathbb{E}[X_T])^2$, we find\n$$\\mathbb{E}[X_T^2] = \\sigma^2 T + (\\mu T)^2 = \\mu^2 T^2 + \\sigma^2 T.$$\nThis result shows that the term $\\mathbb{E}[X_T^2]$ is a constant value that does not depend on the control $u$.\n\nSubstituting this back into the cost functional $J(u)$, we get\n$$J(u) = \\rho \\int_0^T u_t \\, \\mathrm{d}t + \\gamma (\\mu^2 T^2 + \\sigma^2 T).$$\nTo find the minimal value of $J(u)$, we must minimize it over all admissible controls $u$. Since the second term is constant with respect to $u$, the problem reduces to minimizing the first term:\n$$\\min_{u} J(u) = \\rho \\left(\\min_{u} \\int_0^T u_t \\, \\mathrm{d}t\\right) + \\gamma (\\mu^2 T^2 + \\sigma^2 T).$$\nSince $\\rho  0$, we need to minimize the integral $\\int_0^T u_t \\, \\mathrm{d}t$. The control $u_t$ is restricted to values in $\\{-1, 1\\}$. To minimize the integral, the integrand $u_t$ should take its smallest possible value, which is $-1$, for all $t \\in [0,T]$.\nThe optimal control is therefore $u^*_t = -1$ for all $t \\in [0,T]$. This is an admissible control as it is deterministic, constant (hence piecewise constant), and takes a value in $\\{-1, 1\\}$.\n\nThe minimum value of the integral is\n$$\\int_0^T u^*_t \\, \\mathrm{d}t = \\int_0^T (-1) \\, \\mathrm{d}t = -T.$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $J(u)$, we find the minimal value of the cost functional:\n$$J_{min} = \\rho(-T) + \\gamma (\\mu^2 T^2 + \\sigma^2 T) = \\gamma \\mu^2 T^2 + \\gamma \\sigma^2 T - \\rho T.$$\nThis can be written as\n$$J_{min} = \\gamma \\mu^2 T^2 + (\\gamma \\sigma^2 - \\rho) T.$$\nThis is the minimal value of $J(u)$ expressed as a closed-form expression in the given parameters.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\gamma \\mu^{2} T^{2} + (\\gamma \\sigma^{2} - \\rho) T}\n$$", "id": "3077041"}]}
