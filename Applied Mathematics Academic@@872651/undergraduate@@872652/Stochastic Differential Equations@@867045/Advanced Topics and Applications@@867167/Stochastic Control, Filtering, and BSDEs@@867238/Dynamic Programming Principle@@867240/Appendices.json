For any $h>0$ such that $t+h \\le T$, we can split the integral from $t$ to $T$ into an integral from $t$ to $t+h$ and one from $t+h$ to $T$.\n$$\nV(t,x) = \\inf_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}_t} \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\int_t^{t+h} e^{-\\beta(s-t)} f(s, X_s^a, a_s) ds + \\int_{t+h}^T e^{-\\beta(s-t)} f(s, X_s^a, a_s) ds + e^{-\\beta(T-t)} g(X_T^a) \\right].\n$$\nWe can factor out $e^{-\\beta h}$ from the terms involving time greater than $t+h$:\n$$\ne^{-\\beta(s-t)} = e^{-\\beta(s-(t+h))} e^{-\\beta h} \\quad \\text{for } s \\ge t+h,\n$$\n$$\ne^{-\\beta(T-t)} = e^{-\\beta(T-(t+h))} e^{-\\beta h}.\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $V(t,x)$:\n$$\nV(t,x) = \\inf_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}_t} \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\int_t^{t+h} e^{-\\beta(s-t)} f_s ds + e^{-\\beta h} \\left( \\int_{t+h}^T e^{-\\beta(s-(t+h))} f_s ds + e^{-\\beta(T-(t+h))} g(X_T^a) \\right) \\right].\n$$\nUsing the tower property of conditional expectation, $\\mathbb{E}[\\cdot] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{E}[\\cdot | \\mathcal{F}_{t+h}]]$, and the principle of optimality, the inner expression is optimized from time $t+h$ onwards, which by definition is $V(t+h, X_{t+h}^a)$.\n$$\n\\inf_{a' \\in \\mathcal{A}_{t+h}} \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\int_{t+h}^T e^{-\\beta(s-(t+h))} f_s ds + e^{-\\beta(T-(t+h))} g(X_T) \\Big| \\mathcal{F}_{t+h} \\right] = V(t+h, X_{t+h}^a).\n$$\nThis gives the discounted dynamic programming principle:\n$$\nV(t,x) = \\inf_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}_t} \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\int_t^{t+h} e^{-\\beta(s-t)} f(s, X_s^{t,x,a}, a_s) ds + e^{-\\beta h} V(t+h, X_{t+h}^{t,x,a}) \\right].\n$$\n\n### Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) Equation\nTo derive the HJB PDE, we assume $V(t,x)$ is sufficiently smooth ($C^{1,2}$) and consider the limit as $h \\to 0$.\nThe integral term is approximated as: $\\int_t^{t+h} e^{-\\beta(s-t)} f(s, X_s, a_s) ds \\approx f(t,x,a_t) h + o(h)$.\nFor the continuation value, we use Itô's formula for $V(s,X_s)$ and Taylor expansion for $e^{-\\beta h}$:\n$$\ne^{-\\beta h} \\approx 1 - \\beta h.\n$$\nApplying Itô's formula to $V(t,x)$ between $t$ and $t+h$ for a fixed control $a_s=a$:\n$$\ndV(s,X_s) = \\left( \\partial_s V + \\mathcal{L}^a V \\right)ds + \\nabla_x V^\\top \\sigma \\,dW_s.\n$$\nIntegrating and taking expectations, the martingale term vanishes:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[V(t+h, X_{t+h})] - V(t,x) = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_t^{t+h} (\\partial_s V + \\mathcal{L}^a V)ds\\right] \\approx (\\partial_t V + \\mathcal{L}^a V)h.\n$$\nThus, $\\mathbb{E}[V(t+h, X_{t+h})] \\approx V(t,x) + (\\partial_t V + \\mathcal{L}^a V)h$.\nThe expected continuation value is:\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbb{E}[e^{-\\beta h} V(t+h, X_{t+h})] & \\approx (1-\\beta h) \\mathbb{E}[V(t+h, X_{t+h})] \\\\\n& \\approx (1-\\beta h) \\Big( V(t,x) + (\\partial_t V(t,x) + \\mathcal{L}^a V(t,x))h \\Big) \\\\\n& \\approx V(t,x) + (\\partial_t V + \\mathcal{L}^a V)h - \\beta V h + o(h).\n\\end{align*}\nSubstitute these approximations into the DPP:\n$$\nV(t,x) \\approx \\inf_{a \\in A} \\left\\{ f(t,x,a)h + V(t,x) + (\\partial_t V + \\mathcal{L}^a V - \\beta V)h + o(h) \\right\\}.\n$$\nSubtracting $V(t,x)$, dividing by $h$, and taking the limit $h \\to 0$:\n$$\n0 = \\inf_{a \\in A} \\left\\{ f(t,x,a) + \\partial_t V(t,x) + \\mathcal{L}^a V(t,x) - \\beta V(t,x) \\right\\}.\n$$\nRearranging, we get the HJB equation:\n$$\n\\partial_t V(t,x) + \\inf_{a \\in A} \\left\\{ \\mathcal{L}^a V(t,x) + f(t,x,a) \\right\\} - \\beta V(t,x) = 0.\n$$\n\n### Terminal Condition\nThe terminal condition is found by evaluating $V(t,x)$ at $t=T$:\n$$\nV(T,x) = \\inf_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}_T} \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\int_T^T e^{-\\beta(s-T)} f ds + e^{-\\beta(T-T)} g(X_T^{T,x,a}) \\right].\n$$\nThe integral over $[T,T]$ is zero. The exponential factor is $e^0=1$. The process starting at $x$ at time $T$ is simply $X_T^{T,x,a}=x$.\nThus, the terminal condition is $V(T,x) = g(x)$.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. For any $h>0$ such that $t+h\\le T$, the discounted dynamic programming principle can be written as**\n$$ V(t,x) = \\inf_{a}\\,\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\int_{t}^{t+h} e^{-\\beta(s-t)} f\\!\\big(s,X_s^{t,x,a},a_s\\big)\\,ds + e^{-\\beta h} V\\!\\big(t+h,X_{t+h}^{t,x,a}\\big)\\right]. $$\nThis statement matches our derived dynamic programming principle. The discount factor $e^{-\\beta h}$ correctly discounts the continuation value $V(t+h, X_{t+h})$, which represents the optimal cost from time $t+h$ onward (discounted to time $t+h$), back to the present time $t$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Under regularity allowing the use of Itô’s formula and a small-time expansion, the value function $V(t,x)$ of the discounted problem satisfies the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman partial differential equation**\n$$ \\partial_t V(t,x) + \\inf_{a\\in A}\\left\\{ b(t,x,a)\\cdot \\nabla_x V(t,x) + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,\\mathrm{Tr}\\!\\big(\\sigma(t,x,a)\\sigma(t,x,a)^\\top \\nabla_x^2 V(t,x)\\big) + f(t,x,a)\\right\\} - \\beta V(t,x) = 0, $$\n**with terminal condition $V(T,x)=g(x)$.**\nThe term in the braces is $\\mathcal{L}^a V(t,x) + f(t,x,a)$. The equation is therefore $\\partial_t V + \\inf_{a \\in A}\\{\\mathcal{L}^a V + f\\} - \\beta V = 0$. This matches our derived HJB equation. The terminal condition $V(T,x)=g(x)$ also matches our derivation. The effect of discounting introduces the $-\\beta V(t,x)$ term into the standard HJB equation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Discounting multiplies only the running cost at the current time, so the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation becomes**\n$$ \\partial_t V(t,x) + \\inf_{a\\in A}\\left\\{ \\mathcal{L}^a V(t,x) + e^{-\\beta t} f(t,x,a) \\right\\} = 0, $$\n**and the terminal condition becomes $V(T,x)=e^{-\\beta T} g(x)$.**\nThis statement is incorrect for two reasons. First, the HJB equation is incorrect. As shown in the derivation for B, the discounting introduces a $-\\beta V$ term, not a factor of $e^{-\\beta t}$ on the running cost $f$. This modified equation corresponds to a different value function, one that represents the cost discounted to a fixed time (e.g., time $0$) rather than the current time $t$. Second, the terminal condition for the standard value function $V(t,x)$ is $V(T,x)=g(x)$, not $e^{-\\beta T}g(x)$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. In the discounted dynamic programming principle, the discount factor appears only inside the integral term, and the continuation term remains $V(t+h,X_{t+h}^{t,x,a})$ without any multiplicative factor.**\nThis statement claims the DPP is $V(t,x) = \\inf_{a}\\,\\mathbb{E}[\\int_{t}^{t+h} ... ds + V(t+h,X_{t+h})]$. As established in the analysis of option A, the continuation value $V(t+h,X_{t+h})$ must be discounted by a factor of $e^{-\\beta h}$ to relate it to $V(t,x)$. Omitting this factor is a fundamental error and would correspond to an undiscounted problem where $\\beta=0$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Because $\\beta>0$, the boundary condition at the terminal time changes to $V(T,x)=0$ for all $x$, regardless of $g$, since future costs are fully discounted at the horizon $T$.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The value function $V(T,x)$ represents the cost incurred starting at time $T$. By definition of the cost functional, this is precisely the terminal cost $g(x)$. The reasoning \"future costs are fully discounted\" is misapplied. The problem horizon ends at $T$; there are no costs beyond $T$ to be discounted. The terminal cost $g(x)$ is incurred *at* time $T$ and is discounted by $e^{-\\beta(T-T)} = 1$. Therefore, $V(T,x)=g(x)$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "3051379"}, {"introduction": "Once the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation is formulated, the challenge shifts to solving it.

The equation is\n$$\n-\\,\\partial_t v(t,x) = \\inf_{a\\in A} H\\big(t,x,Dv(t,x),D^2v(t,x),a\\big)\n$$\nA candidate for an optimal control is a feedback (or Markovian) control law $\\alpha^*(t,x)$ that, for each state $(t,x)$, achieves the infimum in the HJB equation. That is,\n$$\n\\alpha^*(t,x) \\in \\operatorname*{arg\\,min}_{a \\in A} H\\big(t,x,Dv(t,x),D^2v(t,x),a\\big) \\quad \\text{for all } (t,x) \\in [0,T] \\times \\mathbb{R}^d.\n$$\nOnce such a function $\\alpha^*(t,x)$ is found, the candidate optimal control process is $\\alpha^*_t = \\alpha^*(t, X^*_t)$, where $X^*$ is the solution to the SDE with this control inserted:\n$$\ndX^*_t = b(t,X^*_t,\\alpha^*(t,X^*_t))\\,dt + \\sigma(t,X^*_t,\\alpha^*(t,X^*_t))\\,dW_t.\n$$\nFor this program to be well-defined and for the resulting control process $\\alpha^*_t$ to be admissible, several technical points must be addressed.\n\n1.  **Existence of a minimizer**: For any fixed $(t,x) \\in [0,T] \\times \\mathbb{R}^d$, we need to ensure that the set of minimizers $\\operatorname*{arg\\,min}_{a \\in A} H(\\dots,a)$ is non-empty. Let $p = Dv(t,x)$ and $M = D^2v(t,x)$, which are well-defined since $v \\in C^{1,2}$. The problem states that the functions $f(t,x,a)$, $b(t,x,a)$, and $\\sigma(t,x,a)$ are continuous in $a$ for each fixed $(t,x)$. Therefore, the Hamiltonian $H(t,x,p,M,a)$ is also a continuous function of $a$. Since the control set $A$ is assumed to be a compact metric space, the Extreme Value Theorem (Weierstrass) guarantees that the continuous function $a \\mapsto H(t,x,p,M,a)$ attains its minimum on $A$. Thus, for each $(t,x)$, a minimizer exists.\n\n2.  **Measurability of the selector**: The existence of a minimizer for each $(t,x)$ is not sufficient. We need to be able to select a minimizer $\\alpha^*(t,x)$ for each $(t,x)$ in such a way that the resulting function $\\alpha^*: [0,T] \\times \\mathbb{R}^d \\to A$ is measurable (specifically, Borel measurable). This is required so that the composed process $\\alpha^*(t, X^*_t)$ is well-defined in the context of stochastic integration. The existence of such a a measurable function is not automatic but is guaranteed by a class of results known as \"measurable selection theorems\". A standard version (like the Kuratowski and Ryll-Nardzewski selection theorem) applies here. The required conditions are that the function to be minimized, $(t,x,a) \\mapsto H(t,x,Dv(t,x),D^2v(t,x),a)$, is a Carathéodory function: it is measurable in $(t,x)$ for fixed $a$, and continuous in $a$ for fixed $(t,x)$.\n    - The problem states $b$, $\\sigma$, and $f$ are Borel in $(t,x)$, and continuous in $a$.\n    - The value function $v$ is assumed to be in $C^{1,2}$, which implies its derivatives $Dv(t,x)$ and $D^2v(t,x)$ are continuous functions of $(t,x)$, and therefore Borel measurable.\n    - Since products and sums of Borel measurable functions are Borel measurable, the map $(t,x) \\mapsto H(t,x,Dv(t,x),D^2v(t,x),a)$ is Borel measurable for each fixed $a$.\n    - The conditions for the measurable selection theorem are met. Therefore, there exists a Borel measurable function $\\alpha^*: [0,T]\\times\\mathbb{R}^d\\to A$ that is a pointwise minimizer of the Hamiltonian.\n\n3.  **Admissibility of the feedback control process**: An admissible control process must be progressively measurable. The candidate process is $\\alpha^*_t = \\alpha^*(t,X^*_t)$. The solution $X^*_t$ to the SDE is a continuous, adapted process. A standard result in stochastic processes states that a continuous, adapted process is progressively measurable. This implies that the process $(t, \\omega) \\mapsto (t, X^*_t(\\omega))$ is a progressively measurable process from $([0,T]\\times\\Omega, \\mathcal{P})$ to $([0,T]\\times\\mathbb{R}^d, \\mathcal{B}([0,T]\\times\\mathbb{R}^d))$, where $\\mathcal{P}$ is the progressive sigma-algebra. Since a Borel measurable function of a progressively measurable process is itself progressively measurable, and we have established that a Borel measurable selector $\\alpha^*$ exists, the composite process $\\alpha^*_t = \\alpha^*(t,X^*_t)$ is progressively measurable. This ensures the stochastic integral involving $\\alpha^*_t$ is well-defined.\n\n4.  **Well-posedness of the SDE**: The feedback SDE requires that the coefficients $t \\mapsto b(t, X^*_t, \\alpha^*(t,X^*_t))$ and $t \\mapsto \\sigma(t, X^*_t, \\alpha^*(t,X^*_t))$ satisfy conditions (e.g., local Lipschitz and linear growth in the state variable) that guarantee existence and uniqueness of a solution. The problem statement includes a strong assumption that $b$, $\\sigma$ (and $f$) \"satisfy local Lipschitz and linear growth conditions in $x$ uniformly in $a\\in A$\". This means the Lipschitz and growth constants are independent of $a$. Consequently, for any measurable selector $\\alpha^*(t,x)$, the resulting composed coefficients $x \\mapsto b(t,x,\\alpha^*(t,x))$ and $x \\mapsto \\sigma(t,x,\\alpha^*(t,x))$ automatically satisfy these conditions. This ensures the SDE for $X^*$ is well-posed.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Under the given regularity and compactness assumptions, for each $(t,x)$ there exists a minimizer of $a\\mapsto H\\big(t,x,Dv(t,x),D^2v(t,x),a\\big)$, and a Borel measurable selector $\\alpha^*:[0,T]\\times\\mathbb{R}^d\\to A$ can be chosen so that\n$$\n\\alpha^*(t,x)\\in\\operatorname*{arg\\,min}_{a\\in A}H\\big(t,x,Dv(t,x),D^2v(t,x),a\\big)\\quad\\text{for all }(t,x).\n$$\nThen $\\alpha^*_t=\\alpha^*(t,X^{\\alpha^*}_t)$ is progressively measurable because $(t,X^{\\alpha^*}_t)$ is progressively measurable and $\\alpha^*$ is Borel. If $\\alpha^*$ also obeys the linear growth bound inherited from the minimizers of $H$, this feedback is admissible.**\n\nThis statement accurately follows the line of reasoning detailed above.\n- Existence of a minimizer: Correct, due to continuity of $H$ in $a$ and compactness of $A$.\n- Existence of a Borel measurable selector: Correct, via a measurable selection theorem.\n- Progressive measurability of the feedback process: Correct, as it is a Borel function of a progressively measurable process.\n- Admissibility condition: The final phrase concerning the linear growth bound is slightly redundant given the problem's assumption of uniformity in $a$, but it correctly points to the need for the SDE coefficients to satisfy such bounds for the SDE to be well-posed, which is a component of admissibility. This statement is the most complete and correct description of the procedure.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Pointwise minimization of $a\\mapsto H\\big(t,x,Dv(t,x),D^2v(t,x),a\\big)$ yields some choice $\\alpha^*(t,x)$ for each $(t,x)$, and no measurability of $\\alpha^*$ is needed because the stochastic differential equation depends only on $\\alpha^*_t=\\alpha^*(t,X^{\\alpha^*}_t)$ at each time, which is determined pointwise.**\n\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. Measurability is a prerequisite for a process to be an integrand in a stochastic integral (like the Itô integral). If $\\alpha^*(t,x)$ is not a measurable function, the process $\\alpha^*_t = \\alpha^*(t,X^*_t)$ may not be progressively measurable, and the term $\\int_s^t \\sigma(u,X^*_u,\\alpha^*_u)dW_u$ may be ill-defined. The entire theory of SDEs rests on measurability assumptions.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. It is necessary that the selector $\\alpha^*(t,x)$ be continuous in $(t,x)$; Borel measurability is not enough to guarantee that $\\alpha^*_t=\\alpha^*(t,X^{\\alpha^*}_t)$ is progressively measurable, so a merely Borel selector cannot be used to define an admissible feedback.**\n\nThis statement contains two errors. First, continuity of the selector $\\alpha^*(t,x)$ is a sufficient condition for measurability, but it is by no means necessary. Optimal controls are frequently discontinuous. Second, the claim that \"Borel measurability is not enough\" is false. As explained in the main derivation, a Borel measurable function of a progressively measurable process (like $(t,X^*_t)$) is indeed progressively measurable. This is a standard result in stochastic calculus.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. If the map $a\\mapsto H\\big(t,x,Dv(t,x),D^2v(t,x),a\\big)$ is strictly convex for each $(t,x)$, then uniqueness of the minimizer at each $(t,x)$ automatically guarantees that $\\alpha^*(t,x)$ is measurable in $(t,x)$, so no separate measurability argument is needed to ensure admissibility.**\n\nThis is a subtle but incorrect point. The uniqueness of a minimizer at each point in the domain does not, by itself, guarantee the measurability of the function that maps each point to its unique minimizer. One can construct counterexamples using non-measurable sets where a function has a unique minimizer for each parameter value, but the resulting selection function is not measurable. Measurability must be established through other means, such as a measurable selection theorem, as mentioned in the analysis of option A.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. The feedback control can be taken in the universal form $\\alpha^*(t,x)=-\\,Dv(t,x)$ regardless of the coefficients $b$ and $\\sigma$, and since $v\\in C^{1,2}$ this immediately implies that $\\alpha^*$ is measurable and admissible.**\n\nThis statement is patently false. The form of the optimal control $\\alpha^*(t,x)$ is determined by the minimization of the Hamiltonian and therefore depends explicitly on the functional forms of the cost $f$ and the dynamics coefficients $b$ and $\\sigma$. The form $\\alpha^*(t,x)=-\\,Dv(t,x)$ arises only in very specific cases (e.g., linear-quadratic problems with control entering the drift linearly and with quadratic cost on the control). Claiming this form is \"universal\" and holds \"regardless of the coefficients\" is a gross overgeneralization.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, option A provides the only correct and complete description of the construction and properties of the optimal feedback control.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3051402"}]}
