The justification \"since integration smooths the noise\" is an imprecise, non-rigorous statement that leads to a false conclusion in this context. Although it correctly claims the covariance of non-overlapping increments is non-zero, the primary claim about stationarity is false.\n    The covariance is $\\operatorname{Cov}(\\int_t^{t+h} B_s ds, \\int_{t+h}^{t+2h} B_u du) = \\int_t^{t+h} \\int_{t+h}^{t+2h} \\min(s,u) du ds = \\int_t^{t+h} s h ds = \\frac{h}{2}((t+h)^2-t^2) = th^2 + \\frac{h^3}{2} \\neq 0$.
