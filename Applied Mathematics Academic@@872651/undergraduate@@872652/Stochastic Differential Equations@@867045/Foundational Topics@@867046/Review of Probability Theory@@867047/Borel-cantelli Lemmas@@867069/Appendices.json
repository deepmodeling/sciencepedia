The problem also states that the games are independent, which means the events $\\{A_n\\}_{n=1}^\\infty$ form a sequence of independent events.\n\nWe are asked to find the probability that player A wins infinitely many games. This is the probability that the event $A_n$ occurs for infinitely many values of $n$. In probability theory, this event is known as the limit superior of the sequence of events $\\{A_n\\}$, denoted as $A_{i.o.}$ (infinitely often). The event is formally defined as $A_{i.o.} = \\bigcap_{N=1}^\\infty \\bigcup_{n=N}^\\infty A_n$.\n\nThe Borel-Cantelli lemmas provide a way to calculate the probability of such an event. There are two lemmas:\n1.  **First Borel-Cantelli Lemma:** For any sequence of events $\\{A_n\\}$, if the sum of their probabilities converges, i.e., $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty P(A_n)  \\infty$, then the probability that infinitely many of them occur is 0, i.e., $P(A_{i.o.}) = 0$.\n2.  **Second Borel-Cantelli Lemma:** For a sequence of *independent* events $\\{A_n\\}$, if the sum of their probabilities diverges, i.e., $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty P(A_n) = \\infty$, then the probability that infinitely many of them occur is 1, i.e., $P(A_{i.o.}) = 1$.\n\nIn this problem, the events are independent, so the second lemma is applicable if its condition is met. We need to determine whether the series $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty P(A_n)$ converges or diverges. The series is:\n$$\nS = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{\\ln(n+5)}\n$$\nTo test for divergence, we can use the limit comparison test. We will compare our series with the harmonic series $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n}$, which is known to be divergent. Let $a_n = \\frac{1}{\\ln(n+5)}$ and $b_n = \\frac{1}{n}$. We compute the limit of the ratio of their general terms as $n \\to \\infty$:\n$$\nL = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{a_n}{b_n} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1/\\ln(n+5)}{1/n} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{n}{\\ln(n+5)}\n$$\nThis limit is of the indeterminate form $\\infty/\\infty$, so we can apply L'Hôpital's rule. We consider the corresponding function of a real variable $x$ and take the derivative of the numerator and the denominator:\n$$\nL = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{x}{\\ln(x+5)} = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\frac{d}{dx}(x)}{\\frac{d}{dx}(\\ln(x+5))} = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{1/(x+5)} = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} (x+5) = \\infty\n$$\nSince the limit $L = \\infty$ and the comparison series $\\sum b_n = \\sum \\frac{1}{n}$ diverges, the limit comparison test tells us that the series $\\sum a_n = \\sum \\frac{1}{\\ln(n+5)}$ also diverges.\n\nWe have now established two key facts:\n1. The events $\\{A_n\\}$ are independent.\n2. The sum of their probabilities, $\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty P(A_n) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{\\ln(n+5)}$, diverges.\n\nThese are precisely the conditions for the second Borel-Cantelli lemma. Therefore, we can conclude that the probability of $A_n$ occurring infinitely often is 1.\n$$\nP(A_{i.o.}) = 1\n$$\nThis means that player A is almost surely guaranteed to win infinitely many games.
