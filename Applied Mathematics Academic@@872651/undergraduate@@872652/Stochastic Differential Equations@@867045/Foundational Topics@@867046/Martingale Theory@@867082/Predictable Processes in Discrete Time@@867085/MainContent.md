## Introduction
In the study of stochastic processes, understanding how information unfolds over time is crucial. We often need to distinguish between what is known *at* a specific moment and what was known *before* it. This distinction is central to modeling realistic scenarios, from financial trading to [control systems](@entry_id:155291), where decisions must be made without knowledge of the future. While the concept of an "adapted" process formalizes that a variable's value is known at the current time, it is not sufficient for actions that must be non-anticipating. The stronger notion of a "predictable" process—one whose value at time $n$ is determined by information from time $n-1$—fills this critical gap.

## Principles and Mechanisms

In the study of [stochastic processes](@entry_id:141566), the temporal evolution of information is a concept of paramount importance. To formalize this, we introduce a mathematical structure known as a filtration. Understanding how a process relates to this information flow leads to crucial classifications, among which the distinction between adapted and [predictable processes](@entry_id:262945) is fundamental. This chapter elucidates these concepts, establishing their definitions, relationships, and—most critically—their roles in prediction and in the construction of discrete-time stochastic integrals.

### Information Flow: Filtrations and Adapted Processes

A stochastic process unfolds in time, and with each time step, new information may be revealed. We model the total information available up to a certain point in time using a mathematical object called a **filtration**.

Formally, given a probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$, a **filtration** is a sequence of sub-$\sigma$-algebras $(\mathcal{F}_n)_{n \ge 0}$ of $\mathcal{F}$ that is non-decreasing. This means that for any time $n$, the information available at time $n$ is a subset of the information available at time $n+1$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:
$$ \mathcal{F}_n \subseteq \mathcal{F}_{n+1} \quad \text{for all } n \ge 0 $$
A probability space equipped with such a [filtration](@entry_id:162013) is called a **filtered probability space**. The inclusion condition $\mathcal{F}_n \subseteq \mathcal{F}_{n+1}$ encodes the intuitive idea that information accumulates and is never lost. Any event whose occurrence can be decided with the information at time $n$ (i.e., any event $A \in \mathcal{F}_n$) can also be decided with the information at time $n+1$ (meaning $A \in \mathcal{F}_{n+1}$) [@problem_id:3070238].

A common and important type of [filtration](@entry_id:162013) is the **[natural filtration](@entry_id:200612)** generated by a [stochastic process](@entry_id:159502) itself. For a process $(X_n)_{n \ge 0}$, its [natural filtration](@entry_id:200612) is defined by letting $\mathcal{F}_n$ be the smallest $\sigma$-algebra containing all information about the process up to time $n$. That is:
$$ \mathcal{F}_n = \sigma(X_0, X_1, \dots, X_n) $$
The non-decreasing property $\mathcal{F}_n \subseteq \mathcal{F}_{n+1}$ is satisfied automatically by this construction [@problem_id:3070263]. For example, consider the sequence of binary digits $(b_k(\omega))_{k \ge 1}$ of a number $\omega$ drawn uniformly from $[0,1)$. The process $Y_n(\omega) = b_{n+1}(\omega)$ consists of [independent and identically distributed](@entry_id:169067) Bernoulli random variables. The [natural filtration](@entry_id:200612) $\mathcal{F}_n = \sigma(Y_0, \dots, Y_n)$ represents the information revealed by observing the first $n+1$ binary digits [@problem_id:3070263].

With the concept of a filtration in place, we can classify processes based on how their values relate to the available information. The most basic classification is that of an **[adapted process](@entry_id:196563)**. A process $(X_n)_{n \ge 0}$ is said to be **adapted** to a [filtration](@entry_id:162013) $(\mathcal{F}_n)_{n \ge 0}$ if for every $n \ge 0$, the random variable $X_n$ is $\mathcal{F}_n$-measurable. This definition formalizes the idea that the value of the process at time $n$ is known, given the information available at time $n$.

### The Concept of Predictability

While adaptedness captures what is known *at* a certain time, many applications, such as forecasting, control, or modeling investment strategies, require decisions to be made at time $n$ based only on information available *before* time $n$. This leads to the stronger notion of predictability.

A process $(H_n)_{n \ge 0}$ is called **predictable** (or **previsible**) with respect to a [filtration](@entry_id:162013) $(\mathcal{F}_n)_{n \ge 0}$ if its value at time $n$ is determined by the information available at time $n-1$. Formally:
1.  $H_0$ is $\mathcal{F}_0$-measurable.
2.  For each $n \ge 1$, $H_n$ is $\mathcal{F}_{n-1}$-measurable.

The measurability with respect to $\mathcal{F}_{n-1}$ is the key condition. It means that from the perspective of an observer at time $n-1$, the value that the process will take at the next step, $H_n$, is already known. For example, if $(Y_n)$ is the sequence of Bernoulli random variables from the binary expansion example, the process defined by $H_0 = 0$ and $H_n = 2Y_{n-1} - 1$ for $n \ge 1$ is predictable. The value of $H_n$ is a simple function of $Y_{n-1}$, which by definition is $\mathcal{F}_{n-1}$-measurable [@problem_id:3070263].

Because a [filtration](@entry_id:162013) is a [non-decreasing sequence](@entry_id:139501) of $\sigma$-algebras ($\mathcal{F}_{n-1} \subseteq \mathcal{F}_n$), any random variable that is $\mathcal{F}_{n-1}$-measurable is automatically $\mathcal{F}_n$-measurable. This has an immediate and important consequence: **every [predictable process](@entry_id:274260) is also an [adapted process](@entry_id:196563)** [@problem_id:3070238].

The converse, however, is not true. An [adapted process](@entry_id:196563) is not necessarily predictable. The difference lies in whether the value $X_n$ depends on the "new" information that arrives precisely at time $n$. Consider the increments of a random walk, $\Delta M_n = M_n - M_{n-1}$. This increment is $\mathcal{F}_n$-measurable (and thus the process is adapted), but it is generally not $\mathcal{F}_{n-1}$-measurable because it represents the random innovation at time $n$. Such adapted but non-[predictable processes](@entry_id:262945) are ubiquitous and highlight the strictness of the predictability condition [@problem_id:3070248].

This hierarchy can be stated more formally. In discrete time, there is a third class of processes, called **[optional processes](@entry_id:188160)**. It turns out that for discrete-time processes, the class of [optional processes](@entry_id:188160) is identical to the class of [adapted processes](@entry_id:187710). This establishes a clear hierarchy [@problem_id:3070240]:
$$ \text{Predictable} \subset \text{Optional} = \text{Adapted} $$
The inclusion is strict whenever the filtration exhibits non-trivial growth (i.e., $\mathcal{F}_{n-1} \neq \mathcal{F}_n$ for some $n$). This distinction can be formalized by defining corresponding $\sigma$-algebras on the product space $\mathbb{N}_0 \times \Omega$, where the predictable $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{P}$ is strictly contained within the optional $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{O}$ [@problem_id:3070252].

### Predictability, Prediction, and Conditional Expectation

The sigma-algebra of past information, $\mathcal{F}_{n-1}$, plays a special role in the theory of prediction. Given a random variable $X_n$, its best estimate based on the information available at time $n-1$ is given by the [conditional expectation](@entry_id:159140) $\mathbb{E}[X_n \mid \mathcal{F}_{n-1}]$. This conditional expectation is itself an $\mathcal{F}_{n-1}$-measurable random variable.

The term "best estimate" has a precise geometric meaning. In the Hilbert space $L^2$ of square-integrable random variables, the conditional expectation $\mathbb{E}[X_n \mid \mathcal{F}_{n-1}]$ is the [orthogonal projection](@entry_id:144168) of $X_n$ onto the [closed subspace](@entry_id:267213) of all $\mathcal{F}_{n-1}$-measurable random variables. As such, it is the unique $\mathcal{F}_{n-1}$-measurable random variable $Y$ that minimizes the [mean squared error](@entry_id:276542) $\mathbb{E}[(X_n - Y)^2]$ [@problem_id:3070236]. This makes the set of [predictable processes](@entry_id:262945) the natural space in which to search for forecasts.

If a random variable $X_n$ happens to be independent of the past information $\mathcal{F}_{n-1}$, then this past information is of no use in predicting $X_n$. In this case, the [conditional expectation](@entry_id:159140) simplifies to the unconditional expectation: $\mathbb{E}[X_n \mid \mathcal{F}_{n-1}] = \mathbb{E}[X_n]$ [@problem_id:3070236].

### The Role of Predictability in Stochastic Integration

The most profound application of predictability in discrete time is in the definition of the [stochastic integral](@entry_id:195087), also known as the **[martingale transform](@entry_id:182444)**. This construction is a cornerstone of [stochastic calculus](@entry_id:143864) and mathematical finance.

Suppose we have a martingale $(M_n)_{n \ge 0}$, which can be thought of as the price of a traded asset in a fair game. A trading strategy is a process $(H_n)_{n \ge 1}$ that specifies the number of shares held during the $n$-th time interval, from time $n-1$ to $n$. The decision to hold $H_n$ shares must be made based on information available at time $n-1$. The change in wealth during this interval is $H_n \Delta M_n$, where $\Delta M_n = M_n - M_{n-1}$ is the price change. The cumulative gain or loss up to time $N$ is given by the [discrete stochastic integral](@entry_id:261034):
$$ I_N = \sum_{n=1}^N H_n \Delta M_n $$
A fundamental question arises: what property must the strategy process $(H_n)$ possess to ensure that the resulting wealth process $(I_n)$ is also a martingale (i.e., a fair game)? The answer is that **the integrand process $(H_n)$ must be predictable** [@problem_id:3070253, @problem_id:3070259].

To see why, we examine the [martingale property](@entry_id:261270) for $(I_n)$: we must have $\mathbb{E}[I_N \mid \mathcal{F}_{N-1}] = I_{N-1}$.
$$ \mathbb{E}[I_N \mid \mathcal{F}_{N-1}] = \mathbb{E}[I_{N-1} + H_N \Delta M_N \mid \mathcal{F}_{N-1}] = I_{N-1} + \mathbb{E}[H_N \Delta M_N \mid \mathcal{F}_{N-1}] $$
The [martingale property](@entry_id:261270) holds if and only if the last term is zero.
If $H$ is predictable, then $H_N$ is $\mathcal{F}_{N-1}$-measurable. We can therefore factor it out of the [conditional expectation](@entry_id:159140) (assuming it is bounded):
$$ \mathbb{E}[H_N \Delta M_N \mid \mathcal{F}_{N-1}] = H_N \mathbb{E}[\Delta M_N \mid \mathcal{F}_{N-1}] $$
Since $M$ is a [martingale](@entry_id:146036), we know $\mathbb{E}[\Delta M_N \mid \mathcal{F}_{N-1}] = 0$. This makes the entire expression zero, and $(I_n)$ becomes a martingale.

Conversely, if we were to allow $H_n$ to be merely adapted, it could depend on the contemporaneous increment $\Delta M_n$. This is akin to insider trading; the decision $H_n$ could use information about the price change it is meant to profit from. For instance, consider an adapted strategy like $H_n = \text{sgn}(\Delta M_n)$. This strategy dictates buying if the price goes up and selling if it goes down. The conditional expectation of the gain becomes:
$$ \mathbb{E}[\text{sgn}(\Delta M_n) \Delta M_n \mid \mathcal{F}_{n-1}] = \mathbb{E}[|\Delta M_n| \mid \mathcal{F}_{n-1}] $$
This term is strictly positive as long as the martingale is not constant, creating a systematic profit. The resulting integral would be a [submartingale](@entry_id:263978), not a martingale [@problem_id:3070259]. This demonstrates that the restriction to predictable integrands is not a mere technicality; it is essential to prevent the creation of profit from nothing in a fair game.

### Predictable Variation and Martingale Decompositions

Predictable processes also arise naturally when decomposing other processes. For a square-integrable martingale $(M_n)_{n \ge 0}$, the process $M_n^2$ is generally a [submartingale](@entry_id:263978). The celebrated **Doob-Meyer decomposition theorem** states that any [submartingale](@entry_id:263978) can be uniquely decomposed into the sum of a [martingale](@entry_id:146036) and a predictable, non-decreasing process.

For $M_n^2$, this decomposition is particularly enlightening. We can define two related "variation" processes:
1.  The **[quadratic variation](@entry_id:140680)**, $[M]_n = \sum_{k=1}^n (\Delta M_k)^2$. This is an [adapted process](@entry_id:196563) that sums the squares of the realized increments. It is generally *not* predictable.
2.  The **predictable [quadratic variation](@entry_id:140680)** (or compensator), $\langle M \rangle_n = \sum_{k=1}^n \mathbb{E}[(\Delta M_k)^2 \mid \mathcal{F}_{k-1}]$. By its very construction, this process is predictable, as each term in the sum is $\mathcal{F}_{k-1}$-measurable [@problem_id:3070233].

The predictable quadratic variation $\langle M \rangle_n$ is the unique [predictable process](@entry_id:274260) that "compensates" $M_n^2$ to make it a martingale. Specifically, the process defined by $S_n := M_n^2 - \langle M \rangle_n$ is a martingale. This is the Doob-Meyer decomposition for $M_n^2$. Similarly, the process $Y_n := [M]_n - \langle M \rangle_n$ is also a martingale, showing that $\langle M \rangle_n$ is the [predictable process](@entry_id:274260) that tracks the expected behavior of the [quadratic variation](@entry_id:140680) $[M]_n$ [@problem_id:3070233].

### The Relativity of Predictability

Finally, it is crucial to recognize that predictability is not an absolute property of a process, but a property relative to a specified [filtration](@entry_id:162013). A process might be predictable with respect to one information flow but not another [@problem_id:3070262].

Consider a process $(X_n)$ of [independent random variables](@entry_id:273896) and its [natural filtration](@entry_id:200612) $\mathbb{F} = (\mathcal{F}_n)$ where $\mathcal{F}_n = \sigma(X_0, \dots, X_n)$. The process $K_n = X_{n-1}$ (for $n \ge 1$) is predictable with respect to $\mathbb{F}$ because $X_{n-1}$ is clearly known at time $n-1$. Now, imagine a slower filtration $\mathbb{G} = (\mathcal{G}_n)$ where information is revealed only at even time steps, e.g., $\mathcal{G}_n = \mathcal{F}_{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor}$. With respect to this slower filtration, the process $(K_n)$ is no longer predictable. For instance, to determine $K_3 = X_2$, we would need it to be $\mathcal{G}_2 = \mathcal{F}_{\lfloor 2/2 \rfloor} = \mathcal{F}_1 = \sigma(X_0, X_1)$-measurable. Since $X_2$ is independent of $X_0$ and $X_1$, this fails. This illustrates that the concept of predictability is inextricably linked to the chosen rate and structure of information revelation [@problem_id:3070262].
