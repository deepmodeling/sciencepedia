We will address each part in sequence, starting from fundamental definitions and properties as instructed.\n\nLet $B=(B_t)_{t\\ge 0}$ be a standard Brownian motion on a filtered probability space $(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F},(\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\\ge 0},\\mathbb{P})$ with $B_0=0$. The filtration is the natural filtration of $B$ satisfying the usual conditions. For a fixed $a\\in\\mathbb{R}$, the first hitting time is $\\tau_a=\\inf\\{t\\ge 0:\\,B_t=a\\}$.\n\n1. We first justify that $\\tau_a$ is a stopping time with respect to $(\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t\\ge 0}$. By definition, a random time $\\tau$ is a stopping time if for every $t \\ge 0$, the event $\\{\\tau \\le t\\}$ is in the $\\sigma$-algebra $\\mathcal{F}_t$.\n- If $a=0$, then since $B_0=0$, the infimum is achieved at $t=0$, so $\\tau_0=0$. For any $t\\ge 0$, the event $\\{\\tau_0 \\le t\\}$ is $\\{\\omega \\in \\Omega: 0 \\le t\\}$, which is the entire sample space $\\Omega$. Since $\\mathcal{F}_t$ is a $\\sigma$-algebra on $\\Omega$, $\\Omega \\in \\mathcal{F}_t$. Thus, $\\tau_0$ is a stopping time.\n- If $a \\ne 0$, we rely on the continuity of the sample paths of Brownian motion, which is a fundamental property. Consider the case $a>0$. The event $\\{\\tau_a \\le t\\}$ occurs if the process $B$ reaches the level $a$ at some time $s$ in the interval $[0, t]$. Due to path continuity, this is equivalent to the supremum of the process over $[0, t]$ being greater than or equal to $a$.\n$$ \\{\\tau_a \\le t\\} = \\left\\{ \\omega \\in \\Omega : \\sup_{s \\in [0, t]} B_s(\\omega) \\ge a \\right\\} $$\nTo show this event belongs to $\\mathcal{F}_t$, we must show that the random variable $M_t = \\sup_{s \\in [0, t]} B_s$ is $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable. Because the paths are continuous, the supremum over the interval $[0, t]$ is equal to the supremum over the countable dense subset of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q} \\cap [0, t]$.\n$$ M_t = \\sup_{s \\in [0, t] \\cap \\mathbb{Q}} B_s $$\nFor any $c \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the event $\\{M_t \\le c\\}$ can be written as:\n$$ \\{M_t \\le c\\} = \\bigcap_{s \\in [0, t] \\cap \\mathbb{Q}} \\{B_s \\le c\\} $$\nFor each rational time $s \\in [0, t]$, the random variable $B_s$ is $\\mathcal{F}_s$-measurable by definition of the natural filtration. As $s \\le t$, the filtration property $\\mathcal{F}_s \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}_t$ implies that $B_s$ is also $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable. Consequently, the event $\\{B_s \\le c\\}$ is in $\\mathcal{F}_t$. Since $\\mathcal{F}_t$ is a $\\sigma$-algebra, it is closed under countable intersections. Therefore, $\\{M_t \\le c\\} \\in \\mathcal{F}_t$. This confirms that $M_t$ is an $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable random variable.\nAs a result, the event $\\{\\tau_a \\le t\\} = \\{M_t \\ge a\\}$ is also in $\\mathcal{F}_t$.\n- For the case $a0$, an analogous argument holds using the infimum of the process, $m_t = \\inf_{s \\in [0, t]} B_s$. We have $\\{\\tau_a \\le t\\} = \\{m_t \\le a\\}$, and the $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurability of $m_t$ is proven similarly.\nThus, for any $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $\\tau_a$ is a stopping time.\n\n2. Next, we explain why $T = t \\wedge \\tau_a$ is a bounded stopping time and why $B_T = B_{t \\wedge \\tau_a}$ is integrable.\n- A deterministic time $t$ can be viewed as a constant stopping time. From part 1, $\\tau_a$ is a stopping time. A standard result is that if $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$ are stopping times, then their minimum $\\sigma_1 \\wedge \\sigma_2$ is also a stopping time. Therefore, $T = t \\wedge \\tau_a$ is a stopping time.\n- The stopping time $T$ is bounded because, for any outcome $\\omega \\in \\Omega$, $T(\\omega) = \\min(t, \\tau_a(\\omega))$. By definition of the minimum, $T(\\omega) \\le t$. Since $t$ is a fixed positive constant, $T$ is bounded by $t$.\n- To show that $B_T$ is integrable, we must demonstrate that $\\mathbb{E}[|B_T|]  \\infty$. The random variable $B_T$ can be expressed as:\n$$ B_{t \\wedge \\tau_a} = B_t \\mathbf{1}_{\\{\\tau_a > t\\}} + B_{\\tau_a} \\mathbf{1}_{\\{\\tau_a \\le t\\}} $$\nOn the event $\\{\\tau_a \\le t\\}$, we have $B_{\\tau_a} = a$ by definition of $\\tau_a$. So,\n$$ B_{t \\wedge \\tau_a} = B_t \\mathbf{1}_{\\{\\tau_a > t\\}} + a \\mathbf{1}_{\\{\\tau_a \\le t\\}} $$\nUsing the triangle inequality for the absolute value, we get:\n$$ |B_{t \\wedge \\tau_a}| \\le |B_t \\mathbf{1}_{\\{\\tau_a > t\\}}| + |a \\mathbf{1}_{\\{\\tau_a \\le t\\}}| = |B_t|\\mathbf{1}_{\\{\\tau_a > t\\}} + |a|\\mathbf{1}_{\\{\\tau_a \\le t\\}} $$\nSince the indicator functions are non-negative and partition the sample space, we can establish an upper bound:\n$$ |B_{t \\wedge \\tau_a}| \\le |B_t| + |a| $$\nTaking the expectation of both sides and using its linearity:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[|B_{t \\wedge \\tau_a}|] \\le \\mathbb{E}[|B_t| + |a|] = \\mathbb{E}[|B_t|] + |a| $$\nFor a standard Brownian motion, $B_t$ is a normally distributed random variable with mean $0$ and variance $t$, i.e., $B_t \\sim N(0, t)$. The expected absolute value of $B_t$ is finite and given by $\\mathbb{E}[|B_t|] = \\sqrt{2t/\\pi}$.\nTherefore, $\\mathbb{E}[|B_{t \\wedge \\tau_a}|] \\le \\sqrt{2t/\\pi} + |a|$. Since both $t$ and $a$ are finite, this expectation is finite, which proves that $B_{t \\wedge \\tau_a}$ is an integrable random variable.\n\n3. Finally, we compute the expectation $\\mathbb{E}[B_{t \\wedge \\tau_a}]$ by applying the optional stopping theorem for bounded stopping times. The theorem states that if $(X_t)_{t \\ge 0}$ is a martingale and $T$ is a bounded stopping time, then $\\mathbb{E}[X_T] = \\mathbb{E}[X_0]$.\nWe verify that the conditions of this theorem are satisfied:\n- **Martingale:** The process is $(B_t)_{t\\ge 0}$. It is a fundamental property of standard Brownian motion that it is a martingale with respect to its natural filtration.\n- **Bounded Stopping Time:** The time is $T = t \\wedge \\tau_a$. As established in part 2, this is a stopping time that is bounded by the constant $t$.\nWith all conditions verified, we can apply the theorem to the martingale $B_t$ and the bounded stopping time $T = t \\wedge \\tau_a$:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[B_{t \\wedge \\tau_a}] = \\mathbb{E}[B_0] $$\nThe problem states that the Brownian motion starts at zero, $B_0=0$.\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[B_{t \\wedge \\tau_a}] = \\mathbb{E}[0] = 0 $$\nThus, the expectation of the stopped process is $0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "3078707"}, {"introduction": "The Strong Markov Property elevates the simple Markov property from deterministic times to the more powerful and flexible realm of stopping times.

We are to derive this from first principles, relying on the strong Markov property.\n\nLet $\\{B_{t}\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ be a standard one-dimensional Brownian motion starting at $B_0 = 0$, defined on a probability space $(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F},\\mathbb{P})$. Let $\\{\\mathcal{F}_{t}\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ be the natural filtration generated by $\\{B_{t}\\}_{t \\ge 0}$. For a fixed constant $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the first hitting time is defined as $\\tau_{a} = \\inf\\{t \\ge 0 : B_{t} = a\\}$. It is a standard result that $\\tau_{a}$ is an $\\{\\mathcal{F}_{t}\\}_{t \\ge 0}$-stopping time. It is also a fundamental property of one-dimensional Brownian motion that it is recurrent, which implies that $\\mathbb{P}(\\tau_{a}  \\infty) = 1$ for any $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The paths of a Brownian motion are continuous almost surely. Therefore, on the event $\\{\\tau_{a}  \\infty\\}$, which occurs with probability $1$, we have $B_{\\tau_{a}} = a$.\n\nThe random variable in question is $X_{t} = B_{\\tau_{a}+t} - a$. Using the fact that $B_{\\tau_{a}} = a$ almost surely, we can rewrite $X_{t}$ as:\n$$X_{t} = B_{\\tau_{a}+t} - B_{\\tau_{a}}$$\nThis expression represents the increment of the Brownian motion over a time interval of length $t$, starting from the random time $\\tau_{a}$.\n\nTo analyze the distribution of $X_{t}$, we invoke the strong Markov property of Brownian motion. The strong Markov property states that, conditional on the history of the process up to a stopping time $\\tau$, the future evolution of the process behaves like a new Brownian motion starting from the state at time $\\tau$, and is independent of the past. More formally, let us define a new process $\\{W_{s}\\}_{s \\ge 0}$ by setting $W_{s} = B_{\\tau_{a}+s} - B_{\\tau_{a}}$. The strong Markov property implies that the process $\\{W_{s}\\}_{s \\ge 0}$ is a standard Brownian motion, starting at $W_{0} = 0$, and is independent of the pre-$\\tau_a$ sigma-algebra, $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_{a}}$.\n\nOur random variable is $X_{t} = W_{t}$. We first wish to find the conditional law of $X_{t}$ given $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_{a}}$. The independence of the process $\\{W_{s}\\}_{s \\ge 0}$ from $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_{a}}$ means that for any bounded, measurable function $g: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$, we have:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[g(W_{t}) | \\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_{a}}] = \\mathbb{E}[g(W_{t})]$$\nThe right-hand side is the unconditional expectation of $g(W_{t})$. Since $\\{W_{s}\\}_{s \\ge 0}$ is a standard Brownian motion, the random variable $W_{t}$ has a normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $t$, which we denote by $\\mathcal{N}(0, t)$.\n\nTo find the conditional law, we can consider the conditional cumulative distribution function (CDF). For any $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(X_{t} \\le x | \\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_{a}}) = \\mathbb{P}(W_{t} \\le x | \\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_{a}})$$\nBy the independence property derived from the strong Markov property, this conditional probability is equal to the unconditional probability:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(W_{t} \\le x | \\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_{a}}) = \\mathbb{P}(W_{t} \\le x)$$\nSince $W_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,t)$, we have:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(W_{t} \\le x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{x} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{y^2}{2t}\\right) dy$$\nThis expression is a deterministic function of $x$ and $t$; it does not depend on any random outcomes in $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_{a}}$. Therefore, the conditional law of $X_{t}$ given $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_{a}}$ is the normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, t)$. This means that regardless of how and when the process hits the level $a$, the subsequent displacement $B_{\\tau_a+t} - a$ after a fixed time $t$ always follows the same $\\mathcal{N}(0, t)$ distribution. We can express this by saying $X_t$, conditioned on $\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_a}$, has the same law as $\\tilde{B}_t$, where $\\{\\tilde{B}_s\\}_{s \\ge 0}$ is a standard Brownian motion started at $0$ at time $0$.\n\nNext, we determine the unconditional distribution of $X_{t}$. The unconditional probability $\\mathbb{P}(X_{t} \\le x)$ can be found using the law of total expectation:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(X_{t} \\le x) = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{P}(X_{t} \\le x | \\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_{a}})]$$\nAs we have just established, the conditional probability $\\mathbb{P}(X_{t} \\le x | \\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_{a}})$ is a constant value, equal to $\\mathbb{P}(W_t \\le x)$, which is the CDF of an $\\mathcal{N}(0, t)$ distribution. The expectation of a constant is the constant itself. Therefore:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(X_{t} \\le x) = \\mathbb{P}(W_{t} \\le x)$$\nThis shows that the unconditional distribution of $X_{t}$ is also the normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, t)$.\n\nFinally, the problem asks for the probability density function (PDF) of $X_{t}$. For a random variable following a normal distribution with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2$, the PDF is given by $f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)$. For $X_{t} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, t)$, we have $\\mu=0$ and $\\sigma^2=t$. Substituting these values, we obtain the PDF of $X_{t}$, denoted $f_{X_t}(x)$:\n$$f_{X_t}(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2t}\\right)$$\nThis is the required probability density function.
