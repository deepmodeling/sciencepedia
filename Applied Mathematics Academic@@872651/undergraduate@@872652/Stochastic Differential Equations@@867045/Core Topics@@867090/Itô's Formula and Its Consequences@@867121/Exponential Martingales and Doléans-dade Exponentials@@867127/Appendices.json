It is a standard problem in stochastic calculus.\n\nThe problem asks for two quantities: the explicit closed-form expression for the process $Z_t$, and its expectation $\\mathbb{E}[Z_t]$. The process $Z_t$ is defined as the solution to a stochastic differential equation (SDE).\n\nFirst, let us write the SDE for $Z_t$ explicitly. We are given $dZ_t = Z_t dM_t$ with $Z_0=1$, where $M_t = \\sigma W_t$. Since $dM_t = d(\\sigma W_t) = \\sigma dW_t$, the SDE for $Z_t$ is:\n$$\ndZ_t = \\sigma Z_t dW_t, \\quad Z_0 = 1\n$$\nThis is a linear SDE, also known as a geometric Brownian motion equation. We are tasked to solve this from first principles using Itô calculus. We hypothesize a solution of the form $Z_t = f(t, W_t)$ for some twice continuously differentiable function $f$.\n\nAccording to Itô's lemma for a function of time and a stochastic process, the differential $dZ_t$ is given by:\n$$\ndZ_t = d f(t, W_t) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} dt + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x=W_t} dW_t + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2}\\bigg|_{x=W_t} d\\langle W \\rangle_t\n$$\nFor a standard Brownian motion $W_t$, its predictable quadratic variation is $\\langle W \\rangle_t = t$, which implies $d\\langle W \\rangle_t = dt$. Substituting this into the Itô formula, we get:\n$$\ndZ_t = \\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} \\right) dt + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} dW_t\n$$\nwhere the partial derivatives are evaluated at $(t, W_t)$.\n\nWe equate this expression for $dZ_t$ with the given SDE, $dZ_t = \\sigma Z_t dW_t = \\sigma f(t, W_t) dW_t$. By comparing the coefficients of the $dt$ and $dW_t$ terms (since $dt$ and $dW_t$ are orthogonal in the Itô sense), we obtain a system of partial differential equations (PDEs) for $f(t, x)$:\n1. Coefficient of $dW_t$: $\\displaystyle \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\sigma f(t, x)$\n2. Coefficient of $dt$: $\\displaystyle \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = 0$\n\nLet's solve the first PDE. It is a first-order separable ordinary differential equation in $x$ for a fixed $t$.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{f} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\sigma \\implies \\int \\frac{df}{f} = \\int \\sigma dx \\implies \\ln(f) = \\sigma x + g(t)\n$$\nwhere $g(t)$ is an arbitrary function of $t$. Solving for $f(t, x)$ gives:\n$$\nf(t, x) = \\exp(\\sigma x + g(t)) = K(t) \\exp(\\sigma x)\n$$\nwhere $K(t) = \\exp(g(t))$.\n\nNow, we substitute this form of $f(t, x)$ into the second PDE. We need the partial derivatives of $f$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} = K'(t) \\exp(\\sigma x)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\sigma K(t) \\exp(\\sigma x)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = \\sigma^2 K(t) \\exp(\\sigma x)\n$$\nSubstituting into the second PDE:\n$$\nK'(t) \\exp(\\sigma x) + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 K(t) \\exp(\\sigma x) = 0\n$$\nSince $\\exp(\\sigma x) \\neq 0$, we can divide by it to obtain a simple ordinary differential equation for $K(t)$:\n$$\nK'(t) + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 K(t) = 0\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients. The solution is of the form $K(t) = C \\exp(-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 t)$ for some constant $C$.\n\nCombining our results for $K(t)$ and $f(t, x)$, we find the general solution for $f$:\n$$\nf(t, x) = C \\exp(-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 t) \\exp(\\sigma x) = C \\exp(\\sigma x - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 t)\n$$\nTherefore, the solution for $Z_t$ is:\n$$\nZ_t = f(t, W_t) = C \\exp(\\sigma W_t - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 t)\n$$\nTo find the constant $C$, we use the initial condition $Z_0=1$. We know that $W_0=0$.\n$$\nZ_0 = 1 = C \\exp(\\sigma W_0 - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 \\cdot 0) = C \\exp(0 - 0) = C\n$$\nThus, $C=1$. The explicit closed-form analytic expression for $Z_t$ is:\n$$\nZ_t = \\exp\\left(\\sigma W_t - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 t\\right)\n$$\nThis expression is the Doléans–Dade exponential of $M_t = \\sigma W_t$. In general, for a continuous local martingale $M$, its stochastic exponential $\\mathcal{E}(M)_t$ is given by $\\exp(M_t - \\frac{1}{2}\\langle M \\rangle_t)$. Our derivation confirms this for the specific case $M_t = \\sigma W_t$, where $\\langle M \\rangle_t = \\langle \\sigma W \\rangle_t = \\sigma^2 \\langle W \\rangle_t = \\sigma^2 t$.\n\nNext, we determine the expectation $\\mathbb{E}[Z_t]$ for a fixed $t0$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Z_t] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\exp\\left(\\sigma W_t - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 t\\right)\\right]\n$$\nThe term $\\exp(-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 t)$ is deterministic for a fixed $t$, so it can be factored out of the expectation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Z_t] = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 t\\right) \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\exp(\\sigma W_t)\\right]\n$$\nThe remaining expectation $\\mathbb{E}[\\exp(\\sigma W_t)]$ is the moment-generating function of the random variable $W_t$, evaluated at $\\sigma$. For a standard Brownian motion, $W_t$ is normally distributed with mean $0$ and variance $t$, i.e., $W_t \\sim N(0, t)$.\n\nThe moment-generating function of a general normal random variable $X \\sim N(\\mu, v^2)$ is given by $M_X(s) = \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(sX)] = \\exp(s\\mu + \\frac{1}{2}s^2 v^2)$.\nIn our case, the random variable is $W_t$, so $\\mu=0$ and $v^2=t$. The parameter is $s=\\sigma$. Applying the formula, we have:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\exp(\\sigma W_t)] = \\exp\\left(\\sigma \\cdot 0 + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 t\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 t\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $\\mathbb{E}[Z_t]$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Z_t] = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 t\\right) \\cdot \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 t\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 t + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 t\\right) = \\exp(0) = 1\n$$\nSo, for any fixed $t0$, the expectation of $Z_t$ is $1$. This is consistent with the fact that $Z_t$ is a martingale, as Novikov's condition for martingality, $\\mathbb{E}[\\exp(\\frac{1}{2}\\langle M \\rangle_t)]  \\infty$, is satisfied since $\\langle M \\rangle_t = \\sigma^2 t$ is deterministic and finite for finite $t$.\n\nThe two required results are the expression for $Z_t$ and its expectation $\\mathbb{E}[Z_t]$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\pmatrix{\\exp(\\sigma W_t - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 t)  1}}\n$$", "id": "3052973"}, {"introduction": "This practice delves into a key algebraic property that distinguishes the Doléans-Dade exponential from its deterministic counterpart.

To find its solution, we analyze the behavior of the process between the jumps of the Poisson process $N_t$ and at the jump times themselves. Let the ordered jump times of the Poisson process be $T_1, T_2, T_3, \\dots$.\n\n1.  **Behavior between jumps:**\n    For any time interval $[T_k, T_{k+1})$ between two consecutive jumps (with $T_0 = 0$), the Poisson process $N_t$ is constant. Therefore, its differential $dN_t$ is zero. In this interval, the SDE simplifies to an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Since $Z_t$ is a pure jump process driven by $N_t$, it is continuous between jumps, which means $Z_{t-} = Z_t$ for $t \\in (T_k, T_{k+1})$. The SDE becomes:\n    $$dZ_{t} = -c \\lambda Z_{t} \\, dt$$\n    This is a linear ODE with the solution:\n    $$Z_t = Z_{T_k} \\exp(-c \\lambda (t - T_k)) \\quad \\text{for } t \\in [T_k, T_{k+1})$$\n\n2.  **Behavior at jumps:**\n    At a jump time $T_k$, the Poisson process $N_t$ has a jump of size $\\Delta N_{T_k} = N_{T_k} - N_{T_k-} = 1$. To determine the jump in $Z_t$, denoted $\\Delta Z_{T_k} = Z_{T_k} - Z_{T_k-}$, we consider the integral form of the SDE:\n    $$Z_t = Z_0 + \\int_{0}^{t} c Z_{s-} dN_s - \\int_{0}^{t} c \\lambda Z_{s-} ds$$\n    The jump $\\Delta Z_{T_k}$ is given by the jump in the integral components at time $T_k$. The integral $\\int_{0}^{t} c \\lambda Z_{s-} ds$ is continuous with respect to $t$ because its integrand is a càdlàg (right-continuous with left limits) process. The jump is therefore entirely determined by the stochastic integral term $\\int_{0}^{t} c Z_{s-} dN_s$.\n    The jump of this integral at $T_k$ is:\n    $$\\Delta \\left( \\int_{0}^{t} c Z_{s-} dN_s \\right)_{t=T_k} = c Z_{T_k-} \\Delta N_{T_k}$$\n    Since $\\Delta N_{T_k} = 1$, the jump in $Z_t$ at $T_k$ is:\n    $$\\Delta Z_{T_k} = c Z_{T_k-}$$\n    From this, we find the relationship between the value of $Z_t$ just after and just before the jump:\n    $$Z_{T_k} - Z_{T_k-} = c Z_{T_k-}$$\n    $$Z_{T_k} = (1+c) Z_{T_k-}$$\n    The condition $c  -1$ ensures that $1+c  0$, so the process $Z_t$ remains positive, as expected for a stochastic exponential.\n\n3.  **Constructing the solution path:**\n    We can now construct the solution path-by-path using the relationships derived above, starting from $Z_0=1$.\n    - For $t \\in [0, T_1)$, we have $N_t = 0$. The process evolves according to the ODE:\n      $Z_t = Z_0 \\exp(-c \\lambda t) = \\exp(-c \\lambda t)$.\n    - At the first jump time $T_1$, the value just before the jump is $Z_{T_1-} = \\exp(-c \\lambda T_1)$. The value at the jump is $Z_{T_1} = (1+c) Z_{T_1-} = (1+c) \\exp(-c \\lambda T_1)$.\n    - For $t \\in [T_1, T_2)$, we have $N_t=1$. The process evolves again according to the ODE starting from $Z_{T_1}$:\n      $Z_t = Z_{T_1} \\exp(-c \\lambda (t - T_1)) = (1+c) \\exp(-c \\lambda T_1) \\exp(-c \\lambda (t - T_1)) = (1+c) \\exp(-c \\lambda t)$.\n    - At the second jump time $T_2$, the value just before is $Z_{T_2-} = (1+c) \\exp(-c \\lambda T_2)$. The value at the jump is $Z_{T_2} = (1+c) Z_{T_2-} = (1+c)^2 \\exp(-c \\lambda T_2)$.\n\nBy induction, we can see a general pattern emerging. If there have been $k$ jumps up to time $t$ (i.e., $t \\in [T_k, T_{k+1})$), then $N_t=k$, and the value of the process is:\n$$Z_t = (1+c)^k \\exp(-c \\lambda t)$$\nSince $k = N_t$ for any given $t$, we can write the explicit solution for $Z_t$ as a function of $N_t$:\n$$Z_t = (1+c)^{N_t} \\exp(-c \\lambda t)$$\n\n4.  **Verification of the solution:**\n    To ensure scientific correctness, we verify that our proposed solution satisfies the original SDE. Let $Z_t = (1+c)^{N_t} \\exp(-c \\lambda t)$. We can write this as a product of two processes, $X_t = (1+c)^{N_t}$ and $Y_t = \\exp(-c \\lambda t)$. We use Itô's product rule for semimartingales:\n    $$dZ_t = d(X_t Y_t) = X_{t-} dY_t + Y_{t-} dX_t + d[X, Y]_t$$\n    The process $Y_t$ is deterministic and continuously differentiable, so $dY_t = -c \\lambda \\exp(-c \\lambda t) dt = -c \\lambda Y_t dt$, and the quadratic covariation term $d[X, Y]_t = 0$.\n    The process $X_t$ is a pure jump process. Its differential $dX_t$ is non-zero only at the jump times of $N_t$. The jump in $X_t$ at a jump time $T_k$ is:\n    $$\\Delta X_{T_k} = X_{T_k} - X_{T_k-} = (1+c)^{N_{T_k}} - (1+c)^{N_{T_k-}} = (1+c)^{N_{T_k-}+1} - (1+c)^{N_{T_k-}}$$\n    $$\\Delta X_{T_k} = (1+c)^{N_{T_k-}}(1+c-1) = c (1+c)^{N_{T_k-}} = c X_{T_k-}$$\n    The differential of $X_t$ can be written in terms of $dN_t$ as $dX_t = (X_t - X_{t-})dN_t = \\Delta X_t dN_t = c X_{t-} dN_t$.\n    Substituting these into the product rule, and noting that $Y_t$ is continuous so $Y_{t-} = Y_t$:\n    $$dZ_t = X_{t-} (-c \\lambda Y_t dt) + Y_t (c X_{t-} dN_t)$$\n    $$dZ_t = -c \\lambda (X_{t-} Y_{t-}) dt + c (X_{t-} Y_{t-}) dN_t$$\n    Since $Z_{t-} = X_{t-}Y_{t-}$, we have:\n    $$dZ_t = -c \\lambda Z_{t-} dt + c Z_{t-} dN_t = c Z_{t-} (dN_t - \\lambda dt)$$\n    This is precisely the original SDE, $dZ_t = Z_{t-} d(c \\tilde{N}_t)$. The initial condition $Z_0=(1+c)^{N_0}\\exp(0)=(1+c)^0 \\cdot 1 = 1$ is also satisfied. The derivation is thus validated.\n\nThe explicit expression for $\\mathcal{E}(c \\tilde{N})_{t}$ is therefore $(1+c)^{N_t} \\exp(-c \\lambda t)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{(1+c)^{N_{t}} \\exp(-c \\lambda t)}$$", "id": "3052960"}]}
