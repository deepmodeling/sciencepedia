The derivation must proceed from the fundamental definitions.\n\nThe construction of the Itô integral for a general deterministic function $g \\in L^{2}([s,t])$ proceeds in two stages. First, the integral is defined for simple functions (step functions), and then it is extended to general functions in $L^{2}([s,t])$ via a limit process. We will follow this structure to compute the expectation.\n\n**Step 1: The Itô integral for simple functions**\n\nLet $\\phi:[s,t] \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a simple function. This means that we can find a partition of the interval $[s, t]$, denoted by $s = \\tau_0  \\tau_1  \\dots  \\tau_n = t$, such that $\\phi(u)$ is constant on each subinterval $[\\tau_j, \\tau_{j+1})$. Let the value of $\\phi(u)$ on $[\\tau_j, \\tau_{j+1})$ be the constant $c_j$. We can write $\\phi(u)$ as:\n$$\n\\phi(u) = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} c_j \\mathbb{I}_{[\\tau_j, \\tau_{j+1})}(u)\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbb{I}_{A}(u)$ is the indicator function for the set $A$.\n\nBy definition, the Itô integral of this simple function $\\phi(u)$ with respect to the Brownian motion $W_u$ is given by the sum:\n$$\n\\int_{s}^{t} \\phi(u)\\,dW_{u} = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} c_j (W_{\\tau_{j+1}} - W_{\\tau_j})\n$$\nThis expression is a finite sum of random variables. We can now compute its expectation. Using the linearity of the expectation operator, we have:\n$$\nE\\left[\\int_{s}^{t} \\phi(u)\\,dW_{u}\\right] = E\\left[\\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} c_j (W_{\\tau_{j+1}} - W_{\\tau_j})\\right] = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} E\\left[c_j (W_{\\tau_{j+1}} - W_{\\tau_j})\\right]\n$$\nSince each $c_j$ is a deterministic constant, we can pull it out of the expectation:\n$$\nE\\left[\\int_{s}^{t} \\phi(u)\\,dW_{u}\\right] = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} c_j E\\left[W_{\\tau_{j+1}} - W_{\\tau_j}\\right]\n$$\nA fundamental property of standard Brownian motion, as stated in the problem, is that its increments have a mean of zero. For any $s_1  s_2$, the increment $W_{s_2} - W_{s_1}$ is a normally distributed random variable with mean $E[W_{s_2} - W_{s_1}] = 0$. Applying this property to each term in the sum, with $s_1 = \\tau_j$ and $s_2 = \\tau_{j+1}$, we get:\n$$\nE\\left[W_{\\tau_{j+1}} - W_{\\tau_j}\\right] = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } j = 0, 1, \\dots, n-1\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the expectation of the integral gives:\n$$\nE\\left[\\int_{s}^{t} \\phi(u)\\,dW_{u}\\right] = \\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} c_j \\cdot 0 = 0\n$$\nThus, for any simple function $\\phi(u)$, the expectation of its Itô integral is zero.\n\n**Step 2: Extension to general $L^2$ functions**\n\nThe problem states that $g:[0,T] \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a deterministic function such that $\\int_0^T |g(u)|^2 du  \\infty$. This implies that $g$ belongs to the Hilbert space $L^2([s,t])$. A key result in measure theory is that the set of simple functions is dense in $L^2([s,t])$. This means there exists a sequence of simple functions, $\\{\\phi_k(u)\\}_{k=1}^\\infty$, that converges to $g(u)$ in the $L^2$ norm:\n$$\n\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\int_{s}^{t} |g(u) - \\phi_k(u)|^2 \\,du = 0\n$$\nThe Itô integral for $g(u)$ is then defined as the limit in $L^2(\\Omega)$ of the integrals of the approximating simple functions $\\phi_k(u)$:\n$$\n\\int_{s}^{t} g(u)\\,dW_{u} = L^2(\\Omega)\\text{-}\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\int_{s}^{t} \\phi_k(u)\\,dW_{u}\n$$\nLet $I(f) = \\int_s^t f(u) dW_u$. The convergence in $L^2(\\Omega)$ means that $E\\left[|I(g) - I(\\phi_k)|^2\\right] \\to 0$ as $k \\to \\infty$.\n\nWe want to compute $E[I(g)]$. To do this, we need to show that we can interchange the expectation and the limit:\n$$\nE[I(g)] = E\\left[L^2(\\Omega)\\text{-}\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} I(\\phi_k)\\right] = \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} E[I(\\phi_k)]\n$$\nThis interchange is justified because convergence in $L^2(\\Omega)$ implies convergence in $L^1(\\Omega)$. This can be seen using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or Jensen's inequality for the expectation operator: for any random variable $X$, $(E[|X|])^2 \\leq E[X^2]$.\nLet $X_k = I(g) - I(\\phi_k)$. We have:\n$$\n\\left(E\\left[|I(g) - I(\\phi_k)|\\right]\\right)^2 \\leq E\\left[|I(g) - I(\\phi_k)|^2\\right]\n$$\nSince $I(\\phi_k) \\to I(g)$ in $L^2(\\Omega)$, the right-hand side converges to $0$ as $k \\to \\infty$. This implies that the left-hand side must also converge to $0$, so $E[|I(g) - I(\\phi_k)|] \\to 0$. This is the definition of convergence in $L^1(\\Omega)$.\n\nThe continuity of the expectation operator with respect to $L^1$ convergence gives us:\n$$\n|E[I(g)] - E[I(\\phi_k)]| = |E[I(g) - I(\\phi_k)]| \\leq E[|I(g) - I(\\phi_k)|]\n$$\nAs $k \\to \\infty$, the right-hand side goes to $0$, which implies $\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} E[I(\\phi_k)] = E[I(g)]$.\n\nFrom Step 1, we established that for every simple function $\\phi_k(u)$ in the sequence, its Itô integral has an expectation of zero:\n$$\nE[I(\\phi_k)] = E\\left[\\int_{s}^{t} \\phi_k(u)\\,dW_{u}\\right] = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k\n$$\nTherefore, we can conclude:\n$$\nE\\left[\\int_{s}^{t} g(u)\\,dW_{u}\\right] = \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} E[I(\\phi_k)] = \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} 0 = 0\n$$\n\n**Justification regarding the sign and magnitude of $g(u)$**\n\nThe final result, $0$, is independent of the specific functional form of $g(u)$, including its sign and magnitude, as long as it satisfies the square-integrability condition $g \\in L^2([s,t])$. The reason for this is rooted in the fundamental structure of the Itô integral with a deterministic integrand.\n\nIn the simple function case, the expectation is a sum of terms $c_j E[W_{\\tau_{j+1}} - W_{\\tau_j}]$. Each term is a product of a deterministic coefficient $c_j$ (representing the magnitude and sign of the function $\\phi(u)$ on a subinterval) and the expectation of a Brownian increment, which is always zero. The product $c_j \\times 0$ is always $0$, irrespective of the value of $c_j$. So, for simple functions, the sign and magnitude have no effect on the expectation.\n\nSince the integral for a general function $g(u)$ is constructed as a limit of integrals of simple functions, this property is inherited in the limit. The core mechanism is the pairing of a deterministic function with the increments of a zero-mean process. This structure ensures that, upon taking the expectation, the zero-mean property of the Brownian motion increments dominates, rendering the expectation of the entire integral zero. The role of the $L^2$ condition on $g(u)$ is solely to ensure that the integral is well-defined as a limit in $L^2(\\Omega)$, not to influence the value of its mean. The magnitude of $g(u)$ does affect the variance of the integral, as shown by the Itô isometry ($E[|I(g)|^2] = \\int_s^t |g(u)|^2 du$), but not its expectation.\n\nThe final answer is the real number $0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "3066033"}, {"introduction": "While the deterministic case is foundational, most applications involve stochastic integrands.

So the sum simplifies to $W_T - W_0 = W_T$.\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\mathcal{I}_n$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{I}_{n} = \\frac{W_T}{T} \\cdot W_T = \\frac{W_T^2}{T}\n$$\nThis result for $\\mathcal{I}_n$ is independent of the specific partition $\\pi_n$. Therefore, the limit as the mesh size goes to zero is trivially the same value. The naive integral is:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T} H_{t}\\,dW_{t} \\text{ (naive definition)} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\mathcal{I}_{n} = \\frac{W_T^2}{T}\n$$\nFinally, we compute the expectation of this result:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{T} H_{t}\\,dW_{t}\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{W_T^2}{T}\\right]\n$$\nUsing the linearity of expectation, we can pull out the constant $\\frac{1}{T}$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{W_T^2}{T}\\right] = \\frac{1}{T}\\mathbb{E}\\left[W_T^2\\right]\n$$\nThe variance of a Brownian motion increment is $\\text{Var}(W_t - W_s) = \\mathbb{E}[(W_t-W_s)^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[W_t-W_s])^2 = t-s$. Since $\\mathbb{E}[W_t-W_s]=0$, we have $\\mathbb{E}[(W_t-W_s)^2] = t-s$. Setting $s=0$ and $t=T$, and using $W_0=0$, we get:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[W_T^2] = \\mathbb{E}[(W_T-W_0)^2] = T-0 = T\n$$\nSubstituting this into our expectation calculation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{T} H_{t}\\,dW_{t}\\right] = \\frac{1}{T} \\cdot T = 1\n$$\nThis non-zero result demonstrates that the mean-zero property critically depends on the non-anticipating nature of the integrand, a cornerstone of Itô's theory. The final value is $1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "3066043"}]}
