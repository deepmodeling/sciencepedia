We will proceed with a full solution.\n\n### Solution\n\n**(i) Integral Form of the SDE**\n\nTo obtain the integral form of the SDE, we integrate the differential form from $s=0$ to $s=t$ for any $t \\in [0,T]$.\nGiven $dX_s = (1+s^2)X_s\\,ds + \\sin(s)\\,dW_s$, integration yields:\n$$ \\int_0^t dX_s = \\int_0^t (1+s^2)X_s\\,ds + \\int_0^t \\sin(s)\\,dW_s $$\nBy the fundamental theorem of calculus for stochastic processes, $\\int_0^t dX_s = X_t - X_0$. Substituting the initial condition $X_0 = \\xi$, we get the integral form:\n$$ X_t = \\xi + \\int_0^t (1+s^2)X_s\\,ds + \\int_0^t \\sin(s)\\,dW_s $$\n\n-   The first integral, $I_1 = \\int_0^t (1+s^2)X_s\\,ds$, is an ordinary pathwise Riemann or Lebesgue integral with respect to the time variable $s$. A strong solution $X_s$ is by definition an adapted process with almost surely continuous paths. The function $s \\mapsto (1+s^2)$ is continuous on $[0,T]$. The product of two continuous functions is continuous, so the integrand $(1+s^2)X_s$ is almost surely continuous in $s$. A continuous function on a closed interval $[0,t]$ is bounded and thus Lebesgue integrable. Hence, this integral is well-defined for each sample path $\\omega \\in \\Omega$.\n\n-   The second integral, $I_2 = \\int_0^t \\sin(s)\\,dW_s$, is an Itô stochastic integral. For this integral to be well-defined as a square-integrable martingale, the integrand must be an adapted process and satisfy the condition $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_0^T |\\sin(s)|^2 ds\\right]  \\infty$. The integrand $h(s) = \\sin(s)$ is a deterministic function, which is trivially adapted to any filtration $(\\mathcal{F}_s)_{s \\ge 0}$. Furthermore, $|\\sin(s)| \\le 1$ for all $s$, so we have:\n$$ \\int_0^T |\\sin(s)|^2 ds \\le \\int_0^T 1^2 ds = T  \\infty $$\nThis condition is satisfied, so the Itô integral is well-defined.\n\n**(ii) Verification of Existence and Uniqueness**\n\nThe general SDE is $dX_t = b(t, X_t) dt + \\sigma(t, X_t) dW_t$. For our problem, the drift coefficient is $b(t,x) = (1+t^2)x$ and the diffusion coefficient is $\\sigma(t,x) = \\sin(t)$. The standard existence and uniqueness theorem for strong solutions requires that $b$ and $\\sigma$ satisfy a global Lipschitz condition and a linear growth condition.\n\n1.  **Global Lipschitz Condition:** We need to find a constant $L  0$ such that for all $t \\in [0,T]$ and $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$:\n    $$ |b(t,x) - b(t,y)| + |\\sigma(t,x) - \\sigma(t,y)| \\le L|x-y| $$\n    For the drift:\n    $$ |b(t,x) - b(t,y)| = |(1+t^2)x - (1+t^2)y| = (1+t^2)|x-y| $$\n    Since $t \\in [0,T]$, we have $1+t^2 \\le 1+T^2$. Thus, $|b(t,x) - b(t,y)| \\le (1+T^2)|x-y|$.\n    For the diffusion:\n    $$ |\\sigma(t,x) - \\sigma(t,y)| = |\\sin(t) - \\sin(t)| = 0 \\le 0 \\cdot |x-y| $$\n    Combining these, we get:\n    $$ |b(t,x) - b(t,y)| + |\\sigma(t,x) - \\sigma(t,y)| \\le (1+T^2)|x-y| $$\n    The global Lipschitz condition is satisfied with a Lipschitz constant $L = 1+T^2$.\n\n2.  **Linear Growth Condition:** We need to find a constant $K  0$ such that for all $t \\in [0,T]$ and $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$:\n    $$ |b(t,x)|^2 + |\\sigma(t,x)|^2 \\le K(1 + |x|^2) $$\n    For the drift:\n    $$ |b(t,x)|^2 = |(1+t^2)x|^2 = (1+t^2)^2 x^2 \\le (1+T^2)^2 x^2 $$\n    For the diffusion:\n    $$ |\\sigma(t,x)|^2 = |\\sin(t)|^2 \\le 1 $$\n    Combining these:\n    $$ |b(t,x)|^2 + |\\sigma(t,x)|^2 \\le (1+T^2)^2 x^2 + 1 $$\n    To bound this by $K(1+x^2)$, we can note that $1 \\le 1+x^2$. We can also choose a constant that works for both terms:\n    $$ (1+T^2)^2 x^2 + 1 \\le (1+T^2)^2 x^2 + (1+T^2)^2 = (1+T^2)^2 (1+x^2) $$\n    The linear growth condition is satisfied with $K = (1+T^2)^2$.\n\nSince both the global Lipschitz and linear growth conditions are satisfied, and the initial condition $\\xi$ is square-integrable, the standard theorem guarantees the existence of a pathwise unique strong solution $X_t$ for $t \\in [0,T]$ satisfying $\\mathbb{E}[\\sup_{t\\in[0,T]} |X_t|^2]  \\infty$.\n\n**(iii) Explicit Strong Solution**\n\nThis is a linear SDE, which can be solved using an integrating factor. Let us define a process $Z_t$ as the solution to $dZ_t = -(1+t^2)Z_t dt$ with $Z_0=1$. This is the \"adjoint\" of the homogeneous part of the SDE. The solution is\n$$ Z_t = \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^t (1+s^2) ds\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\left(t + \\frac{t^3}{3}\\right)\\right) $$\nNow, consider the process $Y_t = Z_t X_t$. We apply Itô's product rule for $dY_t = d(Z_t X_t)$:\n$$ dY_t = Z_t dX_t + X_t dZ_t + d\\langle Z, X \\rangle_t $$\nHere, $Z_t$ is a deterministic process of finite variation, so its quadratic variation is zero, meaning $d\\langle Z, X \\rangle_t = 0$.\nWe have $dZ_t = Z_t' dt = -(1+t^2)Z_t dt$. Substituting this and the SDE for $dX_t$:\n$$ dY_t = Z_t \\left( (1+t^2)X_t dt + \\sin(t) dW_t \\right) + X_t \\left( -(1+t^2)Z_t dt \\right) $$\n$$ dY_t = (1+t^2)Z_t X_t dt + Z_t \\sin(t) dW_t - (1+t^2)Z_t X_t dt $$\nThe drift terms cancel out, leaving:\n$$ dY_t = Z_t \\sin(t) dW_t $$\nIntegrating from $s=0$ to $s=t$:\n$$ Y_t - Y_0 = \\int_0^t Z_s \\sin(s) dW_s $$\nWe have $Y_0 = Z_0 X_0 = 1 \\cdot \\xi = \\xi$. Substituting this and $Y_t=Z_t X_t$:\n$$ Z_t X_t - \\xi = \\int_0^t Z_s \\sin(s) dW_s $$\nSolving for $X_t$:\n$$ X_t = \\frac{1}{Z_t} \\left( \\xi + \\int_0^t Z_s \\sin(s) dW_s \\right) $$\nSubstituting back the expressions for $Z_t$ and $Z_s$:\n$$ X_t = \\exp\\left(t + \\frac{t^3}{3}\\right) \\left( \\xi + \\int_0^t \\exp\\left(-\\left(s + \\frac{s^3}{3}\\right)\\right) \\sin(s) dW_s \\right) $$\nThis is the explicit expression for the strong solution $X_t$.\n\n**(iv) Conditional Expectation**\n\nWe need to compute $\\mathbb{E}[X_t \\mid \\mathcal{F}_0]$. Using the explicit solution from part (iii):\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[X_t \\mid \\mathcal{F}_0] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\exp\\left(t + \\frac{t^3}{3}\\right) \\left( \\xi + \\int_0^t \\exp\\left(-\\left(s + \\frac{s^3}{3}\\right)\\right) \\sin(s) dW_s \\right) \\;\\Bigg|\\; \\mathcal{F}_0 \\right] $$\nThe term $\\exp\\left(t + \\frac{t^3}{3}\\right)$ is deterministic and can be pulled out of the conditional expectation. By linearity of conditional expectation:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[X_t \\mid \\mathcal{F}_0] = \\exp\\left(t + \\frac{t^3}{3}\\right) \\left( \\mathbb{E}[\\xi \\mid \\mathcal{F}_0] + \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\int_0^t \\exp\\left(-\\left(s + \\frac{s^3}{3}\\right)\\right) \\sin(s) dW_s \\;\\Bigg|\\; \\mathcal{F}_0 \\right] \\right) $$\nWe analyze each term inside the parenthesis:\n1.  The initial condition $\\xi$ is given as an $\\mathcal{F}_0$-measurable random variable. For any $\\mathcal{F}_0$-measurable random variable $Z$, it holds that $\\mathbb{E}[Z \\mid \\mathcal{F}_0] = Z$. Therefore, $\\mathbb{E}[\\xi \\mid \\mathcal{F}_0] = \\xi$.\n2.  The second term is the conditional expectation of an Itô integral. Let $g(s) = \\exp\\left(-\\left(s + \\frac{s^3}{3}\\right)\\right) \\sin(s)$. This is a deterministic, continuous, and bounded function on $[0,T]$. The process $M_t = \\int_0^t g(s) dW_s$ is a continuous martingale with respect to the filtration $(\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t \\in [0,T]}$, starting at $M_0 = 0$. A fundamental property of martingales is that for any $s \\le t$, $\\mathbb{E}[M_t \\mid \\mathcal{F}_s] = M_s$. Applying this property with $s=0$:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[M_t \\mid \\mathcal{F}_0] = M_0 = \\int_0^0 g(s) dW_s = 0 $$\nSo, the conditional expectation of the stochastic integral term is zero.\n\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for $\\mathbb{E}[X_t \\mid \\mathcal{F}_0]$:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[X_t \\mid \\mathcal{F}_0] = \\exp\\left(t + \\frac{t^3}{3}\\right) (\\xi + 0) = \\xi \\exp\\left(t + \\frac{t^3}{3}\\right) $$\nThis result represents the solution of the deterministic part of the SDE, $dy/dt = (1+t^2)y$, with initial condition $y(0)=\\xi$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\xi \\exp\\left(t + \\frac{t^3}{3}\\right)}$$", "id": "3052190"}, {"introduction": "What happens when the assumptions of the standard theorem are not met?

A key concept is that pathwise uniqueness, combined with the existence of a weak solution, implies the existence of a unique strong solution (Yamada-Watanabe theorem). Our analysis will therefore focus on pathwise uniqueness.\n\n**Analysis of SDE 1: $dX_t=\\sqrt{|X_t|}\\,dt+\\sigma\\,dW_t$ with $\\sigma0$ (Options A and B)**\n\nThis SDE has a drift coefficient $b(X_t) = \\sqrt{|X_t|}$ and a diffusion coefficient $\\sigma(X_t) = \\sigma$, where $\\sigma$ is a positive constant.\nThe drift term is not Lipschitz at the origin, which is the source of non-uniqueness in the corresponding ODE. However, the diffusion term is constant and, critically, non-zero. This is a case of non-degenerate diffusion, as $\\sigma(x)^2 = \\sigma^2  0$ for all $x$, including $x=0$.\n\nA fundamental result in the theory of SDEs, often referred to as \"regularization by noise,\" states that a non-degenerate diffusion term can restore uniqueness even when the drift is not Lipschitz. More formally, theorems by Zvonkin and Veretennikov establish that for a one-dimensional SDE with a bounded, measurable drift and a uniformly elliptic and sufficiently regular diffusion coefficient, a unique strong solution exists. While the drift $b(x)=\\sqrt{|x|}$ is not bounded, it exhibits sub-linear growth, and local versions of these theorems apply. The crucial feature is that the noise term $\\sigma dW_t$ with $\\sigma  0$ almost surely prevents the solution path from spending any positive amount of time at the single point $x=0$. Since the non-uniqueness of the ODE arises from solutions being able to \"rest\" at the singularity at $x=0$, the noise, by \"kicking\" the process away from the origin, resolves the issue.\n\nTherefore, for the SDE $dX_t=\\sqrt{|X_t|}\\,dt+\\sigma\\,dW_t$ with $\\sigma0$, pathwise uniqueness holds. By the Yamada-Watanabe theorem, a unique strong solution exists for the initial condition $X_0=0$.\n\n- **A.

The question of uniqueness now depends on how quickly the diffusion vanishes as $y \\to 0$, in competition with the singularity of the drift.\n\nA widely used criterion, related to the work of Engelbert  Schmidt and Yamada  Watanabe, inspects the integrability of $\\sigma(x)^{-2}$ near the singularity. For the zero-drift SDE $dZ_t = \\sigma(Z_t)dW_t$, pathwise uniqueness from $0$ holds if and only if $\\int_{0+}^\\epsilon \\sigma(x)^{-2} dx = \\infty$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$. While our SDE has a non-zero drift, this condition on the diffusion is a strong indicator of the behavior. If this integral converges, the diffusion is considered too weak to enforce uniqueness on its own, and it is unlikely to tame the non-Lipschitz drift.\n\nLet's apply this test:\n$$ \\int_{0+}^{\\epsilon} \\frac{1}{\\sigma(y)^2} dy = \\int_{0+}^{\\epsilon} \\frac{1}{(c|y|^{\\alpha})^2} dy = \\frac{1}{c^2} \\int_{0+}^{\\epsilon} y^{-2\\alpha} dy $$\nThe convergence of this integral depends on the exponent $-2\\alpha$:\n- If $-2\\alpha  -1$ (i.e., $\\alpha  1/2$), the integral converges.\n- If $-2\\alpha \\le -1$ (i.e., $\\alpha \\ge 1/2$), the integral diverges.\n\n**Option C: The case $\\alpha\\in[0,1/2)$**\n\nFor $\\alpha \\in [0, 1/2)$, the integral $\\int_{0+}^{\\epsilon} y^{-2\\alpha} dy$ converges. This indicates that the diffusion is very weak near the origin. It vanishes \"too quickly\" to regularize the process. The process can exhibit behavior similar to the ODE, where it can remain at $0$ for a random amount of time. The trivial solution $Y_t \\equiv 0$ exists (as $\\sigma(0)=0$ and $b(0)=0$), but non-trivial solutions that \"peel off\" from zero at a random time can also be constructed.

This is the critical case where the diffusion becomes just strong enough to prevent non-uniqueness. A more specific result for SDEs of the form $dX_t = |X_t|^\\beta dt + |X_t|^\\gamma dW_t$ (from J.F.

The coefficients $b(x) = -x^3$ and $\\sigma(x) = x$ are standard functions used to study the behavior of SDEs with non-globally Lipschitz coefficients. The Euler-Maruyama method is the cornerstone of numerical SDEs. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem statement raises questions about the well-posedness of the SDE and the stability of its numerical approximation. These are standard and meaningful questions in the field. To check the SDE's well-posedness, we examine its coefficients.\n    - The coefficients $b(x)=-x^3$ and $\\sigma(x)=x$ are continuously differentiable, hence locally Lipschitz. This guarantees the existence of a unique local strong solution.\n    - For a global solution, we check for stronger conditions. The standard global Lipschitz condition is not met, as $|b'(x)| = |-3x^2|=3x^2$ is unbounded.\n    - However, we can check the one-sided Lipschitz (or monotonicity) condition for the drift and the linear growth condition for the diffusion.\n    - For any $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, the one-sided Lipschitz condition is $(x-y)(b(x)-b(y)) \\le K|x-y|^2$. Here, $(x-y)(-x^3 - (-y^3)) = -(x-y)(x^3-y^3) = -(x-y)^2(x^2+xy+y^2)$. Since $x^2+xy+y^2 \\ge 0$ for all $x,y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have $(x-y)(b(x)-b(y)) \\le 0$. The condition is satisfied with a constant $K=0$. This is a strong dissipativity condition.\n    - The diffusion coefficient satisfies the linear growth condition: $|\\sigma(x)| = |x| \\le 1 \\cdot (1+|x|)$.\n    - A standard theorem in SDE theory states that a one-sided Lipschitz drift and a linearly growing, locally Lipschitz diffusion are sufficient to guarantee the existence of a unique global strong solution. Therefore, the continuous-time problem is well-posed.\n- **Objective:** The problem is phrased in precise mathematical language, free from ambiguity or subjective content.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. There are no identifiable flaws. I will proceed to solve the problem and evaluate each option.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\n**A. For the SDE $dX_t = (-X_t^3)\\,dt + X_t\\,dW_t$ with $X_0=1$, there exists a unique global strong solution on $[0,T]$.**\n\nAs established in the validation phase, the coefficients of the SDE satisfy the necessary conditions for global strong well-posedness. Specifically:\n1.  The drift coefficient $b(x) = -x^3$ and the diffusion coefficient $\\sigma(x) = x$ are locally Lipschitz on $\\mathbb{R}$, which guarantees existence and uniqueness of a local strong solution up to a possible explosion time.\n2.  The drift coefficient $b(x)$ satisfies the one-sided Lipschitz condition: For all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$,\n    $$ (b(x) - b(y))(x-y) = (-x^3 - (-y^3))(x-y) = -(x^3 - y^3)(x-y) = -(x-y)^2(x^2+xy+y^2) \\le 0. $$\n    This is satisfied with a non-positive constant, indicating a dissipative or mean-reverting nature.\n3.  The diffusion coefficient $\\sigma(x)$ satisfies the linear growth condition:\n    $$ |\\sigma(x)| = |x| \\le 1 \\cdot (1+|x|). $$\nThe combination of a one-sided Lipschitz drift and a linearly growing diffusion is a well-known sufficient condition for the non-explosion of solutions, ensuring that the local solution can be extended to a unique global strong solution on any time interval $[0,T]$. The strong dissipative drift $-x^3$ pulls the solution back towards the origin, effectively counteracting the growth from the multiplicative noise $x\\,dW_t$.\n\n**Verdict for A: Correct.**\n\n**B. For the Euler–Maruyama method applied to this SDE, the $p$-th moments are uniformly bounded over small step sizes, that is, for every $p \\ge 1$ and fixed $T0$ there exists $h_00$ such that $\\sup_{0hh_0} \\mathbb{E}[|Y_N|^p]  \\infty$ with $N=\\lfloor T/h\\rfloor$.**\n**C. There exist $p \\ge 1$ and $T0$ such that the Euler–Maruyama method diverges in moments, that is, $\\sup_{0hh_0} \\mathbb{E}[|Y_N|^p] = \\infty$ with $N=\\lfloor T/h\\rfloor$.**\n\nWe analyze options B and C together as they are mutually exclusive. The EM scheme is $Y_{n+1} = Y_n - h Y_n^3 + Y_n \\Delta W_n$. This is an explicit numerical method. For SDEs with superlinearly growing coefficients (here, the drift $b(x)=-x^3$ is superlinear), explicit methods like Euler-Maruyama are known to have stability issues. The numerical solution can fail to reproduce the moment properties of the true solution.\n\nLet's inspect the one-step conditional second moment:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[Y_{n+1}^2 | Y_n] = \\mathbb{E}[(Y_n - h Y_n^3 + Y_n \\Delta W_n)^2 | Y_n] $$\nUsing $\\mathbb{E}[\\Delta W_n] = 0$ and $\\mathbb{E}[(\\Delta W_n)^2] = h$, we get:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[Y_{n+1}^2 | Y_n] = (Y_n - h Y_n^3)^2 + Y_n^2 \\mathbb{E}[(\\Delta W_n)^2] = (Y_n^2 - 2h Y_n^4 + h^2 Y_n^6) + h Y_n^2 $$\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[Y_{n+1}^2 | Y_n] = Y_n^2(1+h) - 2h Y_n^4 + h^2 Y_n^6 $$\nThe term $h^2 Y_n^6$ is problematic. For any fixed step size $h0$, if $|Y_n|$ becomes sufficiently large, this positive term of order $Y_n^6$ will dominate the negative term of order $Y_n^4$, causing the conditional moment to grow very rapidly. This suggests that large values, once reached, can be amplified, leading to moment explosion. While the continuous SDE has a drift that always pulls toward the origin, the discrete update $Y_n - h Y_n^3$ is not monotonic; for large $|Y_n|$ (specifically $|Y_n|  1/\\sqrt{3h}$), the magnitude of this term increases. A large fluctuation from the noise term can push the process into this region of instability.\n\nA precise result from the literature (e.g., Hutzenthaler  Jentzen, 2018) for the SDE $dX_t = (aX_t - bX_t^3)dt + cX_t dW_t$ shows that the $p$-th moment of the EM method is not uniformly bounded with respect to $h$ if $2b  c^2$ and $p  (2b - c^2)/c^2$. In our case, we have $a=0$, $b=1$, and $c=1$. The conditions become $2(1)  1^2$ (which is true) and $p  (2(1) - 1^2)/1^2 = 1$.\nTherefore, for any $p  1$, the $p$-th moments of the EM scheme are not uniformly bounded as $h \\to 0$. This means that for any such $p$, $\\sup_{0hh_0} \\mathbb{E}[|Y_N|^p] = \\infty$.\n\nThis directly contradicts statement B, which claims uniform boundedness for *every* $p \\ge 1$. It confirms statement C, which claims the existence of *some* $p \\ge 1$ (e.g., $p=2$) for which divergence occurs.\n\n**Verdict for B: Incorrect.**\n**Verdict for C: Correct.**\n\n**D. The divergence in moments of the Euler–Maruyama method contradicts or disproves the strong well-posedness (existence and uniqueness of strong solutions) of the underlying SDE.**\n\nThis statement conflates the properties of a mathematical model with the properties of its numerical approximation. The well-posedness of the SDE is an intrinsic property determined by its coefficients, as analyzed in option A. The divergence of the EM moments is a property of the numerical algorithm. It demonstrates that the EM method is not a suitable approximation scheme for this problem in a strong sense without further modification or severe step-size restrictions.\n\nThe failure of a particular numerical method to converge does not imply that a solution does not exist. It simply means the method is inadequate for the task. This is analogous to a simple ODE like $y' = -100y$, whose solution is stable, but for which the explicit Euler method is unstable unless the step size $h$ is very small ($h  2/100$). The instability of the numerical method does not disprove the existence or stability of the true solution $y(t) = y_0 e^{-100t}$.\n\nAs we established in A, the SDE is strongly well-posed. The failure of EM in C does not contradict this fact.\n\n**Verdict for D: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Modifying the Euler–Maruyama method by taming the drift (for example, using the update $Y_{n+1} = Y_n + \\frac{-Y_n^3}{1 + h|Y_n^3|}\\,h + Y_n\\,\\Delta W_n$) can restore moment stability and convergence under appropriate conditions, and this does not alter the strong well-posedness of the continuous-time SDE model.**\n\nThis statement consists of two claims.\n1.  **Restoration of stability:** The proposed modification is a \"drift-tamed\" Euler method. The modified drift update is $b_h(Y_n)h$, where $b_h(y) = \\frac{b(y)}{1+h|b(y)|}$. For our SDE, this is $\\frac{-y^3}{1+h|y^3|}h$. The magnitude of this update is bounded:\n    $$ \\left| \\frac{-y^3}{1+h|y^3|}h \\right| = \\frac{h|y^3|}{1+h|y^3|}  \\frac{h|y^3|}{h|y^3|} = 1. $$\n    This \"taming\" prevents the drift from contributing an explosively large term to the update when $|Y_n|$ is large, thus controlling the instability observed in the standard EM method. For small $|Y_n|$, $h|Y_n^3| \\ll 1$ and the tamed drift $\\frac{-Y_n^3}{1+h|Y_n^3|}$ is very close to the original drift $-Y_n^3$, so the method remains consistent. It has been rigorously proven (e.g., by Hutzenthaler, Jentzen, Kloeden) that such tamed explicit schemes converge strongly for SDEs with superlinear coefficients under a one-sided Lipschitz condition (which our SDE satisfies). Thus, this modification can indeed restore moment stability and strong convergence.\n\n2.  **No alteration of the SDE model:** The modification is applied to the numerical scheme $(Y_n)$, which is an approximation of the true solution $(X_t)$. The definition of the underlying SDE, $dX_t = -X_t^3 dt + X_t dW_t$, remains unchanged. The goal of the tamed scheme is still to approximate the solution to this same SDE. Changing the algorithm does not change the problem being solved. Therefore, the strong well-posedness of the continuous-time model is unaffected.\n\nBoth claims in the statement are correct.\n\n**Verdict for E: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACE}$$", "id": "3052199"}]}
