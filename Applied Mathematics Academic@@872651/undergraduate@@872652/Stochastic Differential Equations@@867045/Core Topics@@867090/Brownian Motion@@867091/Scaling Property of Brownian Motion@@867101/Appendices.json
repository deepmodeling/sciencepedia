This is written as $W_{t'}-W_{s} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, t'-s)$.\nIn our specific case, we are interested in the increment over the time interval $[t, t+h]$. We set $s=t$ and $t'=t+h$. The duration is $(t+h)-t=h$. Therefore, the increment $W_{t+h}-W_{t}$ follows a normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $h$:\n$$\nW_{t+h}-W_{t} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, h)\n$$\nA general normal random variable $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$ can be expressed in terms of a standard normal random variable $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ as $X = \\mu + \\sigma Z$.

It is a standard conceptual question in probability theory.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Heuristic Dimension\n\nThe problem asks to evaluate statements about a scaling heuristic for the dimension of the graph of a Brownian motion, $\\mathcal{G} = \\{(t, B_t) : t \\in [0,1]\\}$. The heuristic is based on box-counting. We cover the graph with a grid of squares of side length $r$ and count the number of squares, $N(r)$, that the graph intersects. The box-counting dimension $D_{box}$ is then given by the scaling law $N(r) \\asymp r^{-D_{box}}$ as $r \\to 0$, or more formally, $D_{box} = \\lim_{r \\to 0} \\frac{\\log N(r)}{\\log(1/r)}$. The problem text suggests using this as a heuristic for the Hausdorff dimension.\n\nLet us follow the reasoning outlined in the problem.\n1.  We consider the time interval $[0,1]$. To cover the graph, we can divide this time interval into small subintervals. Let's choose the width of these subintervals to match the side length of our covering squares, $r$. The number of such time subintervals, or \"slabs,\" is approximately $1/r$.\n\n2.  Within each time slab, say $[t, t+r]$, we need to determine how many squares of side length $r$ are needed to cover the corresponding segment of the graph. The problem provides the heuristic that for a process with Hurst parameter $H$, the typical magnitude of increments over a time duration $\\delta$ is of order $\\delta^H$. For $\\delta = r$, the vertical oscillation of the path, $\\sup_{s \\in [t, t+r]} B_s - \\inf_{s \\in [t, t+r]} B_s$, is of order $r^H$.\n\n3.  To cover a vertical extent of size $r^H$ with squares of side length (height) $r$, we need a column of approximately $r^H / r = r^{H-1}$ squares.\n\n4.  The total number of squares, $N(r)$, is the product of the number of time slabs and the number of squares per slab.\n    $$N(r) \\approx (\\text{number of slabs}) \\times (\\text{squares per slab}) \\approx \\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\right) \\times (r^{H-1}) = r^{H-2}$$\n    Since $r \\to 0$, we have $N(r) \\asymp r^{-(2-H)}$.\n\n5.  Comparing this to the definition $N(r) \\asymp r^{-D_{box}}$, we find the dimension to be $D_{box} = 2-H$.\n\nFor standard Brownian motion, we must determine the value of $H$. A standard Brownian motion $B_t$ is characterized by increments $B_{t+h} - B_t$ being normally distributed with mean $0$ and variance $h$. The \"typical\" size of a random variable is its standard deviation. Therefore, the typical size of an increment over a time interval of length $h$ is $\\sqrt{\\operatorname{Var}(B_{t+h}-B_t)} = \\sqrt{h} = h^{1/2}$. Comparing this with the heuristic definition of increments being of order $\\delta^H$, we have $\\delta=h$ and thus $H=1/2$.\n\nSubstituting $H=1/2$ into our dimension formula, we get the dimension of the Brownian graph:\n$$D = 2 - H = 2 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}$$\nThis heuristic argument correctly yields the known Hausdorff dimension of the graph of a one-dimensional Brownian motion, which is $3/2$ almost surely.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. If one covers the graph on $[0,1]$ by squares of side length $r$, then over each horizontal time-slab of width $r$ the vertical oscillation is typically of order $r^H$, so the number of squares hit in that slab is of order $r^{H-1}$. With about $r^{-1}$ such slabs, the total number of squares is $N(r) \\asymp r^{H-2}$, suggesting a box-counting (and hence heuristically Hausdorff) dimension of $2-H$. For Brownian motion, $H=1/2$, yielding a dimension of $3/2$.**\n\nThis statement perfectly replicates the correct heuristic derivation outlined above. Each step is logically sound within the context of a scaling argument.\n- Number of time slabs of width $r$: $1/r$.\n- Vertical range in a slab: order $r^H$.\n- Squares per slab: $(r^H)/r = r^{H-1}$.\n- Total squares $N(r)$: $(r^{-1})(r^{H-1}) = r^{H-2}$.\n- Implied dimension $D_H$: $2-H$.\n- For Brownian motion, $H=1/2$, so $D = 2 - 1/2 = 3/2$.\nThe entire reasoning is a correct and standard implementation of the box-counting heuristic.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Matching the square side length $\\varepsilon$ to the typical vertical oscillation size $\\varepsilon\\sim \\delta^H$ on a time interval of width $\\delta$ gives $N(\\varepsilon) \\asymp \\varepsilon^{-1/H}$, so the dimension of the graph is $1/H$. For Brownian motion this gives dimension $2$.**\n\nThis statement presents an alternative, but flawed, heuristic. It relates the side length of a square, $\\varepsilon$, to a time scale, $\\delta$, via $\\varepsilon \\sim \\delta^H$, which implies $\\delta \\sim \\varepsilon^{1/H}$. It then claims the number of boxes $N(\\varepsilon)$ is of order $\\varepsilon^{-1/H}$. This number seems to count the number of time intervals of length $\\delta$ in $[0,1]$, which is $1/\\delta \\sim 1/\\varepsilon^{1/H} = \\varepsilon^{-1/H}$. This argument improperly counts the necessary boxes. It fails to account for the horizontal extent of the path segment within the time interval $\\delta$. To cover a path segment occupying a rectangle of size $\\delta \\times \\varepsilon$ with squares of side $\\varepsilon$, one needs $(\\delta/\\varepsilon) \\times (\\varepsilon/\\varepsilon) = \\delta/\\varepsilon$ squares. Substituting $\\delta \\sim \\varepsilon^{1/H}$, the number of squares per segment is $(\\varepsilon^{1/H})/\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon^{(1/H)-1}$. Since there is only one such segment, this doesn't lead to the stated $N(\\varepsilon)$. The argument in B is a common confusion and leads to the incorrect dimension $1/H$. For Brownian motion ($H=1/2$), this would give dimension $2$, which is incorrect. The graph of a one-dimensional Brownian motion does not fill a two-dimensional area.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Because Brownian motion has independent, zero-mean increments with finite variance, the graph has finite total variation and hence finite length almost surely, so its Hausdorff dimension is $1$.**\n\nThis statement contains a significant factual error. While the premises about increments are correct, the conclusion that the graph has finite total variation is false. A famous property of Brownian motion is that its paths are, almost surely, of infinite total variation on any time interval. A path of finite total variation is rectifiable (has finite length), and a rectifiable curve in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ indeed has Hausdorff dimension $1$. However, since a Brownian path is not rectifiable, this conclusion is based on a false premise. The path's roughness is precisely why its dimension is greater than $1$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The Brownian scaling $(t,x)\\mapsto (ct,\\sqrt{c}\\,x)$ acts isotropically on the graph when $c$ varies, so the graph is statistically self-similar under $(t,x)\\mapsto (ct,cx)$, which forces the graph’s Hausdorff dimension to be $2$.**\n\nThis statement mischaracterizes the scaling of Brownian motion. The scaling transformation $(t,x) \\mapsto (ct, \\sqrt{c}\\,x)$ is **anisotropic** or **self-affine**, not isotropic, because the time and space coordinates are scaled by different powers of $c$ ($c^1$ and $c^{1/2}$). Isotropic scaling would be of the form $(t,x) \\mapsto (ct, cx)$. The statement incorrectly claims the anisotropic scaling is isotropic and then incorrectly asserts the graph is self-similar under true isotropic scaling. The conclusion that the dimension must be $2$ is also incorrect; the correct dimension is $3/2$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. For standard one-dimensional Brownian motion, $H=1/2$ follows from $\\operatorname{Var}(B_{t+h}-B_t)=h$, which implies that typical increments over a time interval of length $h$ are of order $h^{1/2}$.**\n\nThis statement provides the justification for using $H=1/2$ for standard Brownian motion. As established in the derivation, the definition of standard Brownian motion implies that an increment $B_{t+h}-B_t$ has a normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $h$. The standard deviation, $\\sqrt{h} = h^{1/2}$, is the natural measure of the \"typical\" size of this increment. This matches the heuristic definition of the Hurst parameter $H$ given in the problem, leading to $H=1/2$. This is a crucial and correct part of the overall argument connecting the properties of Brownian motion to the dimension of its graph. The question asks for statements that correctly implement the argument *and its relation to H=1/2*. This statement correctly explains that relation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AE}$$", "id": "3073105"}]}
