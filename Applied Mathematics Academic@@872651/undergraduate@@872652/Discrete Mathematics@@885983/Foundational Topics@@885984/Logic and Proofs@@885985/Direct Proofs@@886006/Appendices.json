Thus $c_k = k^2+5 \\equiv 1+2 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$, so $c_k$ is divisible by $3$.\nHence, A holds for all integers $k$.\n\nFor B, use parity. If $k$ is even, then $k^2$ is even, so $a_k = k^2+1$, $b_k = k^2+3$, and $c_k = k^2+5$ are all odd and thus none is divisible by $2$. Therefore, B is false.\n\nFor C, consider modulo $5$. If $k \\equiv \\pm 1 \\pmod{5}$, then $k^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$. Consequently, $a_k \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$, $b_k \\equiv 4 \\pmod{5}$, and $c_k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$, so none is $0 \\pmod{5}$. Therefore, C is false.\n\nFor D, take $k=0$. Then $a_k b_k c_k = (0^2+1)(0^2+3)(0^2+5) = 1 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 = 15$, which is not a perfect square.
