Addition; Simplification", "solution": "The goal is to determine the correct rules of inference for steps 4 and 7 of the given formal proof. We will analyze each step independently.\n\n**Analysis of Step 4:**\n\nThe proposition at step 4 is $q \\lor s$. To find its justification, we must identify which preceding propositions are used as premises for the inference. The rule must combine these premises to logically derive $q \\lor s$.\n\nLet's examine the propositions from steps 1, 2, and 3:\n- Step 1: $p \\to q$\n- Step 2: $r \\to s$\n- Step 3: $p \\lor r$\n\nWe are looking for a rule of inference that takes premises of the form $(P \\to Q)$, $(R \\to S)$, and $(P \\lor R)$ and yields the conclusion $(Q \\lor S)$. This pattern perfectly matches the rule known as **Constructive Dilemma**. The logic is as follows: we know that either $p$ is true or $r$ is true (from step 3).\n- If $p$ is true, then by Modus Ponens with step 1, $q$ must be true.\n- If $r$ is true, then by Modus Ponens with step 2, $s$ must be true.\nSince one of $p$ or $r$ must be true, it follows that one of $q$ or $s$ must be true. Therefore, $q \\lor s$ is the valid conclusion.\n\nSo, the justification for step 4 is **Constructive Dilemma**.\n\n**Analysis of Step 7:**\n\nThe proposition at step 7 is $\\neg q$. We need to find the rule and premises that lead to this conclusion. The premises must be drawn from steps 1 through 6.\n\nLet's examine the propositions from steps 5 and 6:\n- Step 5: $q \\to t$\n- Step 6: $\\neg t$\n\nWe are looking for a rule of inference that takes a conditional statement $(P \\to Q)$ and the negation of its consequent, $\\neg Q$, to conclude the negation of its antecedent, $\\neg P$. This is the definition of the rule of inference **Modus Tollens**. In this case, $P$ is $q$ and $Q$ is $t$. The premises are $q \\to t$ and $\\neg t$, so the valid conclusion is $\\neg q$.\n\nSo, the justification for step 7 is **Modus Tollens**.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe justification for step 4 is Constructive Dilemma, and the justification for step 7 is Modus Tollens.

This practice challenges you to start with a set of established facts—the premises—and forge a chain of reasoning to arrive at a necessary conclusion.

However, the second premise provides $r \\rightarrow q$, not $q \\rightarrow r$. Inferring $r$ from $q$ using $r \\rightarrow q$ would be the fallacy of affirming the consequent. Therefore, no valid rule allows deriving $r$ from the given premises, and thus $p \\rightarrow r$ is not entailed.\n\nProvide a countermodel (valuation) showing the premises can be true while the conclusion is false:\n- Let $p=\\text{T}$, $q=\\text{T}$, $r=\\text{F}$.\n- Then $p \\rightarrow q$ evaluates to $\\text{T}$ because $\\text{T} \\rightarrow \\text{T}$ is $\\text{T}$.\n- Also $r \\rightarrow q$ evaluates to $\\text{T}$ because $\\text{F} \\rightarrow \\text{T}$ is $\\text{T}$.\n- But $p \\rightarrow r$ evaluates to $\\text{F}$ because $\\text{T} \\rightarrow \\text{F}$ is $\\text{F}$.\n\nSince there exists a valuation where both premises are true and the conclusion is false, the argument is not logically valid.
