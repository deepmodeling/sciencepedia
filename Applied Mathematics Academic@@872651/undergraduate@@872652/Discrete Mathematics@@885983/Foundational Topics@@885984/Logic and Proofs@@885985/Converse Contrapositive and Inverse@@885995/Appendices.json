The original statement $S$ is $P \\implies Q$.\n\nTo determine the truth of $S$: Assume $P$ holds, so $k=4n+1$ for some $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Then $k=2(2n)+1$, which implies $k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$.

We analyze $S$ and its converse, inverse, and contrapositive for universal validity over arbitrary sets $A$, $B$, and $C$.\n\nFirst, test $S$: assume $A \\cap C \\subseteq B \\cap C$. Claim: $A \\subseteq B$. This is not universally valid. Provide a counterexample: take $C=\\emptyset$. Then $A \\cap C=\\emptyset$ and $B \\cap C=\\emptyset$, so $A \\cap C \\subseteq B \\cap C$ holds. However, $A \\subseteq B$ need not hold; for instance, take $A \\not\\subseteq B$. Therefore, $S$ is not universally true.\n\nSecond, the converse of $S$ is: if $A \\subseteq B$, then $A \\cap C \\subseteq B \\cap C$. This is universally true. Proof: assume $A \\subseteq B$. Let $x \\in A \\cap C$. Then $x \\in A$ and $x \\in C$. Since $A \\subseteq B$, we have $x \\in B$. Hence $x \\in B \\cap C$. Therefore every $x \\in A \\cap C$ lies in $B \\cap C$, so $A \\cap C \\subseteq B \\cap C$.\n\nThird, the inverse of $S$ is: if $A \\cap C \\not\\subseteq B \\cap C$, then $A \\not\\subseteq B$. This is universally true. There are two ways to see this:\n- Logical route: the converse (just proved) states $A \\subseteq B \\implies A \\cap C \\subseteq B \\cap C$. Its contrapositive is $\\neg(A \\cap C \\subseteq B \\cap C) \\implies \\neg(A \\subseteq B)$, which is exactly the inverse of $S$. Since the converse is universally true, its contrapositive (the inverse of $S$) is also universally true.\n- Direct element-wise proof: $A \\cap C \\not\\subseteq B \\cap C$ means there exists $x$ with $x \\in A \\cap C$ and $x \\notin B \\cap C$. The latter means $x \\notin B$ or $x \\notin C$. But $x \\in A \\cap C$ implies $x \\in C$, hence the only possibility is $x \\notin B$. Thus $x \\in A$ and $x \\notin B$, proving $A \\not\\subseteq B$.\n\nFourth, the contrapositive of $S$ is: if $A \\not\\subseteq B$, then $A \\cap C \\not\\subseteq B \\cap C$. This is logically equivalent to $S$, hence it is not universally true (since $S$ is not). A concrete counterexample again uses $C=\\emptyset$: take $A \\not\\subseteq B$; then $A \\cap C=\\emptyset$ and $B \\cap C=\\emptyset$, so $A \\cap C \\subseteq B \\cap C$ holds, making $A \\cap C \\not\\subseteq B \\cap C$ false while the antecedent is true.\n\nTherefore, among the four statements, exactly the converse (II) and the inverse (III) are universally true.\n\nThus the correct option is II and III only.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1360278"}]}
