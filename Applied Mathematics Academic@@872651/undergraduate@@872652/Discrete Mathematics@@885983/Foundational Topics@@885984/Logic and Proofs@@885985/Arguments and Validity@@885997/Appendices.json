They are interested in the behavior of a new fraud detection module.\n\nLet the following propositions be defined:\n- $p$: The new fraud detection module flagged the transaction.\n- $q$: The transaction is delayed for manual review.\n\nFrom reading the system design document, Alex knows for a fact that if the new fraud detection module flags a transaction, it is always sent for manual review.\n\nBen runs a system query and finds a specific transaction that was delayed for manual review. Based on this single piece of information, Ben concludes, \"The transaction was delayed for manual review, therefore the new fraud detection module must have flagged it.\"\n\nYour task is to analyze the logical structure of Ben's reasoning.

Ben observes a particular instance of $q$ and concludes $p$.\n\nThe argument’s logical form is:\nPremise 1: $p \\rightarrow q$.\nPremise 2: $q$.\nConclusion: $p$.\n\nThis is the inference pattern \"affirming the consequent.\" To assess validity, use the equivalence $p \\rightarrow q \\equiv \\neg p \\lor q$. An argument is valid only if no valuation makes all premises true while making the conclusion false. Consider the valuation where $p$ is false and $q$ is true. Then:\n- Premise 1 evaluates to $\\neg p \\lor q$, which is true because $\\neg p$ is true.\n- Premise 2 is $q$, which is true by assignment.\n- The conclusion $p$ is false by assignment.\nThus, there exists a valuation making the premises true and the conclusion false, so the argument is invalid.\n\nThis matches the well-known fallacy of affirming the consequent and is not Modus Ponens (which would require $p$ as a premise) nor Modus Tollens (which would require $\\neg q$ as a premise), nor is it denying the antecedent (which has the form $p \\rightarrow q$, $\\neg p$, therefore $\\neg q$).\n\nTherefore, the most accurate assessment is that the argument is invalid; it is an example of the fallacy of affirming the consequent.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1350110"}, {"introduction": "In contrast to spotting fallacies, constructing a deductively valid argument is key to building reliable systems and proofs.

Every incoming packet is classified as either encrypted or plaintext.\n2. If a packet is encrypted, it is routed to the quarantine server for inspection.\n3. If a packet is a plaintext packet, it is also routed to the quarantine server for inspection as a security precaution.\n\nA system administrator claims that these three rules together logically guarantee that every packet, without exception, is routed to the quarantine server for inspection.

Since we have $\\forall x\\,(T(x)\\rightarrow L(x))$, by contraposition (classical logic) we obtain:\n$$\\forall x\\,(\\neg L(x)\\rightarrow \\neg T(x)).$$\nAlternatively, from Premise 3, $\\neg T(x)$ holds for every $x$, making the implication $\\neg L(x)\\rightarrow \\neg T(x)$ true for every $x$ because its consequent is true. Thus II is valid.\n\nIII. Let $B(x)$ denote “$x$ is secretly copied to a backup in Antarctica.” The statement is $\\forall x\\,(T(x)\\rightarrow B(x))$. From Premise 3, for arbitrary $x$, $T(x)$ is false; by the truth table for material implication, $T(x)\\rightarrow B(x)$ is true for any $B(x)$. Universal generalization yields $\\forall x\\,(T(x)\\rightarrow B(x))$. Thus III is valid (vacuously).\n\nIV. Formalize as “no reroute occurs as a result of triggering”: $\\neg\\exists x\\,(T(x)\\wedge Q(x))$. From Premise 3, $\\forall x\\,\\neg T(x)$, which implies $\\forall x\\,\\neg (T(x)\\wedge Q(x))$, hence $\\neg\\exists x\\,(T(x)\\wedge Q(x))$.
