Many real-world situations, from selecting pizza toppings to configuring software, involve choosing a combination of items from a given set. This exercise models such a scenario, where we must count the number of valid configurations by excluding the cases of choosing \"nothing\" or \"everything,\" which directly corresponds to finding the number of non-empty proper subsets [@problem_id:1403041].", "problem": "A software company is developing a new data analytics platform. The platform's configuration can be customized by enabling or disabling a specific set of five optional modules: a Machine Learning toolkit, a real-time Streaming processor, a distributed File System connector, an advanced Visualization engine, and a security Auditing logger. For a configuration to be considered a \"valid custom build,\" it must satisfy two conditions: it must include at least one optional module, and it cannot include all five optional modules simultaneously. How many distinct \"valid custom builds\" are possible?", "solution": "Let the set of optional modules be a set $M$ with $|M|=5$. Any configuration corresponds to a subset $S \\subseteq M$, where a module is enabled if and only if it is included in $S$.\n\nThe total number of possible configurations (including enabling none or all) is $2^{5}$, since each of the $5$ modules can be either enabled or disabled independently.\n\nA \"valid custom build\" must satisfy two conditions:\n- It includes at least one module: this excludes the empty set, which contributes $\\binom{5}{0}=1$ configuration.\n- It does not include all five modules: this excludes the full set $M$, which contributes $\\binom{5}{5}=1$ configuration.\n\nTherefore, the number of valid custom builds is\n$$\n2^{5}-\\binom{5}{0}-\\binom{5}{5}=2^{5}-1-1=32-2=30.\n$$\nEquivalently, summing over allowed sizes gives\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{4}\\binom{5}{k}=\\binom{5}{1}+\\binom{5}{2}+\\binom{5}{3}+\\binom{5}{4}=5+10+10+5=30.\n$$\nHence, there are $30$ distinct valid custom builds.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{30}$$", "id": "1403041"}, {"introduction": "Now that we have practiced counting subsets directly, let's explore a common type of scientific inquiry: reverse-engineering a system from observed data. In many fields, we can count the number of possible outcomes or interactions but don't know the number of fundamental components involved. This problem challenges you to work backward, using the number of observed \"viable complexes\" to determine the size of the original set of proteins, thereby reinforcing your understanding of the formula for non-empty proper subsets from a different and powerful perspective [@problem_id:1403007].", "problem": "In a cellular biology lab, researchers are studying a family of interacting proteins. Let's denote the total number of distinct proteins in this family by $n$. A \"protein complex\" is formed when a group of one or more of these proteins binds together. Each unique combination of proteins forms a distinct complex. For classification purposes, the researchers have defined two special cases:\n1. The \"null state,\" which corresponds to an absence of any proteins, is not considered a functional complex.\n2. The \"saturated complex,\" a hypothetical state where all $n$ proteins bind together, has been shown to be physically unstable and does not form.\n\nAll other possible combinations of proteins are considered \"viable complexes.\" After an exhaustive experimental survey, the lab has identified and cataloged exactly 510 distinct viable complexes. Based on this information, determine the total number of distinct proteins, $n$, in the family.", "solution": "Let the set of all distinct proteins be a set $S$ with $|S|=n$. A protein complex corresponds to a subset $A \\subseteq S$. The null state is the empty subset with $|A|=0$, and the saturated complex is the full subset with $|A|=n$. Both are excluded. Therefore, viable complexes correspond exactly to the nonempty proper subsets, i.e., subsets with sizes $k$ where $1 \\leq k \\leq n-1$.\n\nThe number of subsets of size $k$ is $\\binom{n}{k}$. Hence, the total number of viable complexes is\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n}{k}.\n$$\nUsing the binomial identity $\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} = 2^{n}$, and subtracting the $k=0$ and $k=n$ terms, we get\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\binom{n}{k} = 2^{n} - 2.\n$$\nWe are told this equals $510$, so\n$$\n2^{n} - 2 = 510 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad 2^{n} = 512.\n$$\nTaking base-$2$ logarithms,\n$$\nn = \\log_{2}(512).\n$$\nSince $512 = 2^{9}$, it follows that\n$$\nn = 9.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9}$$", "id": "1403007"}, {"introduction": "This final practice elevates our analysis from counting individual subsets to counting ordered pairs of subsets that satisfy a specific relationship. The problem asks us to find the number of pairs $(A, B)$ where $A$ is a proper subset of $B$. Solving this requires a more sophisticated combinatorial technique where we consider the \"status\" of each element in the universal set relative to both subsets $A$ and $B$. Mastering this approach provides a powerful tool for solving a wide range of complex enumeration problems [@problem_id:1403064].", "problem": "Let $S$ be a finite set with cardinality $n$, where $n$ is a non-negative integer.
