The relevant number-theoretic principle is that the sum of two integers is even if and only if the two integers have the same parity. We also identify the primes in $B$: the set of primes not exceeding $10$ is $\\{2,3,5,7\\}$.\n\nWe partition by parity. In $A$, the even elements are $A_{\\text{even}} = \\{2,4\\}$ with $|A_{\\text{even}}| = 2$, and the odd elements are $A_{\\text{odd}} = \\{1,3,5\\}$ with $|A_{\\text{odd}}| = 3$. In the prime set, the even prime is $P_{\\text{even}} = \\{2\\}$ with $|P_{\\text{even}}| = 1$, and the odd primes are $P_{\\text{odd}} = \\{3,5,7\\}$ with $|P_{\\text{odd}}| = 3$.\n\nThe condition $a+b$ even requires matching parity between $a$ and $b$.

So, $(x, y) \\in S$.\nBy the definition of the projection set $\\pi_1(S)$, since $(x, y) \\in S$, the first component $x$ must be an element of $\\pi_1(S)$.

So, $y \\in \\pi_2(S)$.\nNow, consider the Cartesian product $\\pi_1(S) \\times \\pi_2(S)$. By definition, this set consists of all ordered pairs $(a, b)$ such that $a \\in \\pi_1(S)$ and $b \\in \\pi_2(S)$.\nSince we have established that $x \\in \\pi_1(S)$ and $y \\in \\pi_2(S)$, the pair $(x, y)$ meets the criteria for membership in this Cartesian product. Thus, $(x, y) \\in \\pi_1(S) \\times \\pi_2(S)$.\nSince our choice of $(x, y)$ was an arbitrary element of $S$, we have shown that every element of $S$ is also an element of $\\pi_1(S) \\times \\pi_2(S)$.
