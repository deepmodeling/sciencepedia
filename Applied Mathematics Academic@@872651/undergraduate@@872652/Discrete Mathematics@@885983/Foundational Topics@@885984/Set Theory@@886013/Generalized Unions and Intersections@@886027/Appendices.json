The argument of any $z \\in S$ is of the form $2\\pi r$ with $r \\in \\mathbb{Q}$; that is, the argument is a rational multiple of $2\\pi$ (understanding the argument modulo $2\\pi$).\n\nConversely, if $z$ lies on the unit circle with an argument equal to $2\\pi r$ for some $r\\in\\mathbb{Q}$, we can write $r=\\frac{p}{q}$ where $p,q$ are integers and $q > 0$.
