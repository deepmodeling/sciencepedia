The set is $S = \\mathbb{Z}^+$, and the relation is $a \\, R \\, b$ if and only if $b-a = 3k$ for some integer $k \\ge 0$.\n\n1.  **Reflexivity**: A relation $R$ is reflexive if for every element $a \\in S$, $a \\, R \\, a$.\n    For any $a \\in S$, we consider the difference $a - a = 0$. We can write $0$ as $3 \\times 0$. Since $k=0$ is a non-negative integer, the condition $a-a = 3k$ with $k \\ge 0$ is satisfied. Thus, $a \\, R \\, a$ is true for all $a \\in S$.

This means $b-a = 3k$ for some integer $k \\ge 0$.\n    For $b \\, R \\, a$ to be true, we would need $a-b = 3j$ for some integer $j \\ge 0$.\n    From the assumption, we have $a-b = -(b-a) = -3k$.\n    So we need $-3k = 3j$, which implies $j = -k$.\n    Since the definition requires $j \\ge 0$ and we assumed $k \\ge 0$, the only way for $j = -k$ to hold is if $k=0$ and $j=0$.\n    If $k=0$, then $b-a=0$, which means $a=b$. In this case, $a \\, R \\, a$ trivially implies $a \\, R \\, a$.\n    However, if we choose $a \\neq b$, symmetry may not hold. Let's test with a counterexample. Let $a=1$ and $b=4$.\n    $b-a = 4-1 = 3$. Since $3 = 3 \\times 1$ and $1 \\ge 0$, we have $1 \\, R \\, 4$.\n    Now we check if $4 \\, R \\, 1$. We look at the difference $1-4 = -3$. Since $-3$ is not a non-negative multiple of 3, the condition is not met. Thus, $4$ is not related to $1$.\n    Since we found a pair $(a,b)$ such that $a \\, R \\, b$ but not $b \\, R \\, a$, the relation is **not symmetric**.\n    This immediately rules out options B and C.\n\n3.  **Antisymmetry**: A relation $R$ is antisymmetric if for every pair of elements $a, b \\in S$, if $a \\, R \\, b$ and $b \\, R \\, a$, then $a=b$.\n    Assume $a \\, R \\, b$ and $b \\, R \\, a$.\n    From $a \\, R \\, b$, we have $b-a = 3k$ for some integer $k \\ge 0$.\n    From $b \\, R \\, a$, we have $a-b = 3j$ for some integer $j \\ge 0$.\n    Adding these two equations gives: $(b-a) + (a-b) = 3k + 3j$, which simplifies to $0 = 3(k+j)$, so $k+j=0$.\n    Since $k$ and $j$ are both non-negative integers, the only way their sum can be zero is if both are zero, i.e., $k=0$ and $j=0$.\n    If $k=0$, then $b-a = 3(0) = 0$, which implies $b=a$.\n    Therefore, the condition for antisymmetry is met. The relation is **antisymmetric**.\n\n4.  **Transitivity**: A relation $R$ is transitive if for every triplet $a, b, c \\in S$, if $a \\, R \\, b$ and $b \\, R \\, c$, then $a \\, R \\, c$.\n    Assume $a \\, R \\, b$ and $b \\, R \\, c$.\n    From $a \\, R \\, b$, we have $b-a = 3k$ for some integer $k \\ge 0$.\n    From $b \\, R \\, c$, we have $c-b = 3j$ for some integer $j \\ge 0$.\n    To check for $a \\, R \\, c$, we examine the difference $c-a$.\n    We can write $c-a$ as $(c-b) + (b-a)$.\n    Substituting from our assumptions: $c-a = 3j + 3k = 3(j+k)$.\n    Let $m = j+k$. Since $j$ and $k$ are non-negative integers, their sum $m$ is also a non-negative integer.\n    Thus, $c-a$ is a non-negative multiple of 3, which means $a \\, R \\, c$.\n    Therefore, the relation is **transitive**.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nThe relation $R$ is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. A relation with these three properties is defined as a **partial order**.\nThis eliminates option A. We are left with options D and E.\n\nNow we must determine if the relation is a **total order**. A partial order is a total order if for any two elements $a, b \\in S$, either $a \\, R \\, b$ or $b \\, R \\, a$ (or both). This property is called comparability.\nLet's pick two elements from $S$ and check if they are comparable. For example, let $a=1$ and $b=2$.\n- To check for $1 \\, R \\, 2$: $2-1=1$. Since $1$ is not a multiple of 3, $1$ is not related to $2$.\n- To check for $2 \\, R \\, 1$: $1-2 = -1$. Since $-1$ is not a non-negative multiple of 3, $2$ is not related to $1$.\nSince we found a pair of elements $(1, 2)$ where neither $1 \\, R \\, 2$ nor $2 \\, R \\, 1$ is true, the relation is not total.\n\nTherefore, the relation $R$ is a partial order, but not a total order.
