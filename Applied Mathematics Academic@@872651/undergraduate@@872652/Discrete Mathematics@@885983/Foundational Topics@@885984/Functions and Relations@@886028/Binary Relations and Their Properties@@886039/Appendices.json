This practice uses a relatable financial model to make the abstract concept of an equivalence class tangible and intuitive.

The prices can be any integer value (positive, negative, or zero), so the set of all possible transactions is $S = \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nA relation $R$ is defined on the set $S$ to identify transactions that are \"profit-equivalent\". Two transactions, $T_1 = (a, b)$ and $T_2 = (c, d)$, are related, denoted by $(a, b) R (c, d)$, if and only if they yield the same profit. The profit for a transaction $(p_b, p_s)$ is calculated as $p_s - p_b$.\n\nThis relation $R$ is an equivalence relation (you do not need to prove this). Your task is to determine the equivalence class for the specific transaction $T_0 = (7, 3)$.

These are often modeled by partial orders, which are reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. This exercise invites you to explore the classic \"divisibility\" relation, a fundamental example of a partial order, and analyze its structural properties, such as its maximal and least elements, chains, and antichains [@problem_id:1352548].", "problem": "Let $S$ be the set of integers $\\{1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20\\}$.

The size of the largest antichain (the width of the poset) is 2.\n\nE.

This $R$ is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive, hence a partial order.\n\nTo test statement A, recall that $m\\in S$ is maximal if there is no $x\\in S$ with $mRx$ and $m\\neq x$. Check each element: $1$ divides $2$, $4$, $5$, $10$, $20$; $2$ divides $4$, $10$, $20$; $4$ divides $20$; $5$ divides $10$, $20$; $10$ divides $20$; $20$ divides only itself within $S$. Thus the only maximal element is $20$. Therefore statement A is false.\n\nFor statement B, a least element $\\ell\\in S$ satisfies $\\ell R b$ for all $b\\in S$. Since $1$ divides every element of $S$, $1$ is the least element. Hence statement B is true.\n\nFor statement C, a chain is a subset of $S$ in which every pair of elements is comparable. Examples of maximal chains are\n$$\n1\\mid 2\\mid 4\\mid 20,\\qquad 1\\mid 5\\mid 10\\mid 20,\n$$\neach containing $4$ elements. No chain can contain both $4$ and $5$ since neither divides the other, so a chain cannot exceed $4$ elements. Therefore the longest chain has $4$ elements, and its length, defined as the number of elements minus $1$, is $3$. Statement C, which claims length $4$, is false.\n\nFor statement D, an antichain is a subset of $S$ in which no two distinct elements are comparable. The elements $1$ and $20$ are comparable with every other element, so they cannot be in any antichain of size greater than $1$. Restricting to $\\{2,4,5,10\\}$, the comparabilities are $2\\mid 4$, $2\\mid 10$, and $5\\mid 10$, while $4$ and $5$ are incomparable, and $4$ and $10$ are incomparable, and $2$ and $5$ are incomparable. Any $3$-subset among $\\{2,4,5,10\\}$ contains a comparable pair, so the largest antichain has size $2$, for example $\\{4,5\\}$. Hence statement D is true.\n\nFor statement E, a total order requires that every pair be comparable. Since $2$ and $5$ are not comparable (neither $2\\mid 5$ nor $5\\mid 2$), $R$ is not a total order.
