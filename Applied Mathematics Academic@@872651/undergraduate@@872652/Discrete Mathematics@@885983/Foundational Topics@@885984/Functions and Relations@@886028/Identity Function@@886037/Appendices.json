If we have a function $f$, its inverse, often denoted $f^{-1}$, is a function that \"undoes\" the action of $f$. Formally, the composition of a function and its inverse yields the identity function. This practice [@problem_id:1375117] frames this concept in a practical scenario of an encoder-decoder system, where your task is to find the correct \"decoder\" function that perfectly reverses the \"encoder,\" thereby restoring the original input.", "problem": "In a secure data transmission system, a numerical signal is processed through two stages. The first stage is an 'encoder' and the second is a 'decoder'. The encoder is a function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ that transforms an input real number $x$ according to the rule $f(x) = 8x^3 - 1$. The second stage is a decoder, which is another function $g: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nFor the system to work correctly, applying the decoder function to the output of the encoder function must perfectly recover the original input signal. This requirement means that the composition of the two functions, $(g \\circ f)$, must be equivalent to the identity function on the set of real numbers. The identity function, denoted as $id_{\\mathbb{R}}$, is defined as $id_{\\mathbb{R}}(x) = x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n\nGiven the encoding function $f(x)$, determine the mathematical expression for the corresponding decoding function $g(x)$ that satisfies the condition $(g \\circ f)(x) = x$ for all real numbers $x$.", "solution": "We require a decoder function $g:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ such that $(g\\circ f)(x)=x$ for all $x\\in\\mathbb{R}$, where $f(x)=8x^{3}-1$. This means $g$ must be the inverse of $f$.\n\nTo find the inverse, set $y=f(x)=8x^{3}-1$ and solve for $x$ in terms of $y$:\n$$\ny+1=8x^{3},\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{y+1}{8}=x^{3},\n$$\n$$\nx=\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{y+1}{8}}.\n$$\nThus the inverse function is $g(y)=\\sqrt[3]{\\frac{y+1}{8}}$.
