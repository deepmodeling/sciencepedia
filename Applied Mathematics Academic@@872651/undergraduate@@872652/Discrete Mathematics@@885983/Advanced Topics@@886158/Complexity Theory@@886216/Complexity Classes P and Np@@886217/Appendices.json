This real-world selection process can be modeled as a formal problem in computer science. Consider the following scenario:\n\nThere are $n$ applicants for the committee. Due to various conflicts of interest and interpersonal issues, a list of pairs of applicants who are incompatible with each other is provided. The goal is to form a committee of size $k$ such that no two members of the committee are incompatible.\n\nTo analyze the computational complexity of this task, the problem is modeled using a graph $G=(V, E)$, where the set of vertices $V$ corresponds to the set of $n$ applicants, and an undirected edge $(u, v)$ exists in the set of edges $E$ if and only if applicants $u$ and $v$ are incompatible.\n\nThe decision problem is: \"Given the graph $G$ and an integer $k$, does a valid committee of size $k$ exist?\"\n\nThis committee selection problem is equivalent to a well-known problem in complexity theory.

Let $G=(V,E)$ be an undirected graph where $V$ is the set of $n$ applicants and $(u,v)\\in E$ if and only if applicants $u$ and $v$ are incompatible. A valid committee of size $k$ is a subset $S\\subseteq V$ such that $|S|=k$ and no two members of $S$ are incompatible. Formally, this requires\n$$\n\\forall u,v\\in S,\\ u\\neq v \\implies (u,v)\\notin E.\n$$\nBy definition in graph theory, a set $S\\subseteq V$ is an independent set if and only if no edge of $E$ has both endpoints in $S$, equivalently\n$$\n\\forall u,v\\in S,\\ u\\neq v \\implies (u,v)\\notin E.\n$$\nComparing the two conditions, the committee feasibility condition is exactly the definition of an independent set. Therefore, the decision problem “Given $G$ and $k$, does there exist a committee of size $k$ with no incompatible pair?” is precisely the INDEPENDENT SET problem: decide whether $G$ has an independent set of size at least $k$.\n\nFor completeness, note that a CLIQUE would require all pairs in $S$ to be adjacent, which would correspond to modeling compatibility as edges rather than incompatibility; VERTEX COVER, HAMILTONIAN PATH, 2-SATISFIABILITY, and EULERIAN PATH do not match the stated constraint structure.

If you can efficiently transform any instance of Problem A into an instance of Problem B, then a fast algorithm for B would give you a fast algorithm for A. This practice asks you to devise such a transformation between two seemingly opposite social network problems, demonstrating their deep computational connection and providing a hands-on look at the logic underpinning the theory of NP-completeness [@problem_id:1357884].", "problem": "In the study of social networks, we can model a network as a graph $G = (V, E)$, where the set of vertices $V$ represents people, and an edge $(u, v) \\in E$ indicates that person $u$ and person $v$ are friends. We can define two fundamental group-finding problems:\n\n1.  The **FRIEND-GROUP** problem: Given a social network graph $G$ and a positive integer $k$, determine if there exists a group of $k$ people who are all mutual friends. Formally, is there a subset of vertices $C \\subseteq V$ such that $|C|=k$ and for every distinct pair of vertices $u, v \\in C$, the edge $(u, v)$ is in $E$?\n\n2.

Formally, is there a subset of vertices $I \\subseteq V$ such that $|I|=k$ and for every distinct pair of vertices $u, v \\in I$, the edge $(u, v)$ is *not* in $E$?\n\nSuppose you are given a hypothetical supercomputer, an \"oracle,\" that can solve any instance of the STRANGER-GROUP problem instantly. Your task is to use this oracle to solve the FRIEND-GROUP problem. You must devise a procedure that takes an input $(G, k)$ for the FRIEND-GROUP problem, transforms it into an input $(G', k')$ for the STRANGER-GROUP problem, queries the oracle with $(G', k')$, and uses the oracle's yes/no answer to correctly solve the original problem. The entire transformation process must be computationally efficient (i.e., executable in polynomial time with respect to the size of the input graph $G$).\n\nWhich of the following procedures correctly describes how to solve the FRIEND-GROUP problem for an input $(G, k)$ using the STRANGER-GROUP oracle?\n\nA.

An edge exists between two vertices in $G'$ if and only if there *is* an edge between them in $G$. Call the oracle with the input $(G', k)$.", "solution": "We formalize the two decision problems in graph-theoretic terms. The FRIEND-GROUP problem on input $(G,k)$ asks whether $G=(V,E)$ contains a clique $C \\subseteq V$ of size $k$, i.e., for all distinct $u,v \\in C$, $(u,v) \\in E$. The STRANGER-GROUP problem on input $(G,k)$ asks whether $G$ contains an independent set $I \\subseteq V$ of size $k$, i.e., for all distinct $u,v \\in I$, $(u,v) \\notin E$.\n\nTo solve FRIEND-GROUP using a STRANGER-GROUP oracle, construct the complement graph $G'=(V,E')$ of $G$ defined by\n$$\nE' \\;=\\; \\{\\, (u,v) \\in V \\times V \\;\\mid\\; u \\neq v \\text{ and } (u,v) \\notin E \\,\\}.\n$$\nThis construction can be performed in time polynomial in $|V|$, since it requires checking adjacency for each unordered pair of distinct vertices.\n\nWe prove correctness of the reduction:\n- If $C \\subseteq V$ with $|C|=k$ is a clique in $G$, then for all distinct $u,v \\in C$ we have $(u,v) \\in E$. By the definition of $G'$, this implies $(u,v) \\notin E'$, hence no two vertices in $C$ are adjacent in $G'$. Therefore $C$ is an independent set of size $k$ in $G'$.\n- Conversely, if $I \\subseteq V$ with $|I|=k$ is an independent set in $G'$, then for all distinct $u,v \\in I$ we have $(u,v) \\notin E'$, which by complementarity implies $(u,v) \\in E$. Therefore $I$ is a clique of size $k$ in $G$.\n\nThus, $G$ has a clique of size $k$ if and only if $G'$ has an independent set of size $k$. Therefore, given $(G,k)$ for FRIEND-GROUP, we construct $G'$ as above and query the STRANGER-GROUP oracle with $(G', k)$. The oracle answers “yes” if and only if the original FRIEND-GROUP instance is a “yes” instance.\n\nAmong the provided procedures, option A precisely describes this reduction. Option B queries the oracle on $(G,k)$, which tests for an independent set in $G$ rather than a clique in $G$. Option C incorrectly changes the parameter to $|V|-k$, which pertains to the relationship between independent set and vertex cover, not clique. Option D’s graph modification does not establish the required equivalence. Option E is equivalent to B and is incorrect for the same reason.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1357884"}, {"introduction": "It is a common misconception that certain problems are universally \"hard.\" In reality, a problem's complexity can be highly sensitive to constraints on its input, and identifying such special cases is key to efficient algorithm design. This practice demonstrates this principle vividly by exploring the LONGEST PATH problem, which is famously NP-hard in general graphs but becomes surprisingly tractable when the network is guaranteed to have a specific, simpler structure [@problem_id:1357913].

To minimize latency and potential points of failure, the network topology is designed as a **tree**, which is a connected graph with no cycles. In this network, each node represents a router, and each edge represents a direct, symmetric communication link.\n\nThe architect needs to identify the path with the maximum possible latency between any two routers in the network. This corresponds to finding the **longest simple path** in the graph, where a simple path is one that does not repeat any nodes, and the length of a path is defined as the number of edges it contains.\n\nIn the general theory of algorithms, problems are often classified into complexity classes. The class **P** (Polynomial time) includes all decision problems that can be solved by an algorithm in a time that is a polynomial function of the size of the input. The class **NP** (Nondeterministic Polynomial time) includes all decision problems for which a given solution can be verified for correctness in polynomial time. It is known that for a general, arbitrary graph, the problem of finding the longest simple path is NP-hard, meaning it is at least as hard as the most difficult problems in NP.\n\nGiven that the network is specifically structured as a tree, how does this constraint affect the computational complexity of finding the longest simple path between any two nodes?\n\nSelect the correct classification for the \"Longest Path in a Tree\" problem.\n\nA.

A vertex maximizing distance from an arbitrary start $r$ is a leaf and is an endpoint of some diameter; running BFS from such an endpoint $u$ finds the other endpoint $v$ that maximizes $\\mathrm{dist}(u,\\cdot)$, yielding the diameter length $D$.\n\nTime complexity: A BFS on $T$ runs in time $O(|V|+|E|)$. Since $|E|=|V|-1$, a BFS on a tree runs in $O(|V|)$. Performing two BFS traversals therefore runs in $O(|V|)$ time, which is polynomial in the input size.
