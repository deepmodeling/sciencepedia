We check if $5 - 2$ is divisible by $3$. Since $5 - 2 = 3$, which is divisible by $3$, the premise is TRUE.\nNext, we check the conclusion $Q: c^a \\equiv c^b \\pmod{m}$.\nIs $1^2 \\equiv 1^5 \\pmod{3}$? We calculate the values: $1^2 = 1$ and $1^5 = 1$.

So, $2^1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{7}$.\nFor the right side, we can use Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that if $p$ is a prime number, then for any integer $c$ not divisible by $p$, we have $c^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$. Here, $p=7$ is prime and $c=2$ is not divisible by 7.

So, $2^1 \\equiv 2 \\pmod{4}$.\nThe right side is $2^5 = 32$. To find $32 \\pmod{4}$, we note that $32 = 8 \\times 4$.
