Two fundamental concepts are Hamming weight and Hamming distance. The Hamming weight of a binary number is defined as the count of '1's in its binary string. The Hamming distance between two binary numbers of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.\n\nConsider two 8-bit unsigned binary numbers, denoted as $X$ and $Y$. The Hamming weight of $X$ is given as $w(X) = 2$, and the Hamming weight of $Y$ is given as $w(Y) = 7$.\n\nBased on this information, determine the maximum possible value for the Hamming distance between $X$ and $Y$.", "solution": "Let $X$ and $Y$ be 8-bit binary vectors, and let $S_{X}$ and $S_{Y}$ denote the sets of indices where $X$ and $Y$ have bit $1$, respectively. Then $|S_{X}|=w(X)=2$ and $|S_{Y}|=w(Y)=7$.

It is defined as the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols (bits) are different.\n\nConsider a simple error-correction scenario where a 5-bit data packet is transmitted through three redundant channels. Due to potential noise during transmission, the three packets received at the destination are not identical. The received packets are:\n$S_1 = 10100$\n$S_2 = 01100$\n$S_3 = 11110$\n\nTo reconstruct the most likely original data packet, a common strategy is to find a \"consensus\" string. This is a 5-bit binary string, let's call it $C$, which minimizes the sum of the Hamming distances to each of the three received strings. That is, we seek to find the string $C$ that minimizes the quantity $d(C, S_1) + d(C, S_2) + d(C, S_3)$.\n\nFind the 5-bit binary consensus string $C$.", "solution": "The Hamming distance between two binary strings $x$ and $y$ of length $5$ is defined as $d(x,y)$, the number of positions where they differ.

Therefore, for each coordinate $j$, $C_{j}$ should equal the majority bit among $\\{(S_{1})_{j},(S_{2})_{j},(S_{3})_{j}\\}$.\n\nWe evaluate each position:\n- Position $1$: bits are $\\{1,0,1\\}$, majority $1$, so $C_{1}=1$.\n- Position $2$: bits are $\\{0,1,1\\}$, majority $1$, so $C_{2}=1$.\n- Position $3$: bits are $\\{1,1,1\\}$, majority $1$, so $C_{3}=1$.\n- Position $4$: bits are $\\{0,0,1\\}$, majority $0$, so $C_{4}=0$.\n- Position $5$: bits are $\\{0,0,0\\}$, majority $0$, so $C_{5}=0$.\n\nHence the consensus string is $C=11100$. The minimal total Hamming distance equals the sum of the counts of minority bits at each position, which here is $1+1+0+1+0=3$, confirming optimality.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{11100}$$", "id": "1373967"}]}
