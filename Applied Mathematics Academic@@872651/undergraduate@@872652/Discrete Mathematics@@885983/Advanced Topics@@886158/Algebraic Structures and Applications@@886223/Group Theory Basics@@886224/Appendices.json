Since each column must contain each element exactly once, the missing entry in column $w$ must be $y$, hence $y*w=y$. Therefore $a*w=a$ for all $a\\in\\{w,x,y,z\\}$, so $w$ is a right identity for the group. By uniqueness of the identity in a group, $w$ is the (two-sided) identity element $e$, so also $w*a=a$ for all $a$, yielding $w*x=x$, $w*y=y$, and $w*z=z$.\n\nNext, determine $x*y$. Consider column $y$. It must be a permutation of $\\{w,x,y,z\\}$. We have $y*y=w$ and $z*y=x$, and from the identity we have $w*y=y$. Therefore the only remaining element to appear in column $y$ is $z$, and it must occur in row $x$. Hence $x*y=z$.\n\nNow complete row $x$. Row $x$ must be a permutation and currently contains $x*w=x$, $x*x=y$, and $x*y=z$. The remaining entry is $x*z=w$, so $x*z=w$.\n\nFinally, determine $y*z$ and $z*x$. Row $y$ must be a permutation and currently has $y*w=y$, $y*x=z$, and $y*y=w$, so the remaining entry is $y*z=x$, giving $y*z=x$. For $z*x$, use column $x$, which must be a permutation and currently has $w*x=x$, $x*x=y$, and $y*x=z$, so the remaining entry is $z*x=w$.\n\nTherefore, the requested products are $x*y=z$, $z*x=w$, and $y*z=x$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} z & w & x \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1372936"}, {"introduction": "Within any group, each element has its own distinct rhythm.

The order of an element $g$ in a finite group is the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $g^k$ equals the identity element.

The order of the group $G = \\{1, 2, \\ldots, 16\\}$ is its size, which is $16$. Therefore, the possible values for the order of the element $3$ are the positive divisors of $16$, which are $1, 2, 4, 8, 16$.\n\nWe can now test these possibilities by computing the powers of $3$ modulo $17$, starting with the smallest divisor.\n\n1.
