Each token is a flat, rectangular tile, conceptually divided into two identical square halves. Each half is to be marked with a single digit from the set $S = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. A token's configuration can be described by the ordered pair of digits on its halves.\n\nThe rules of the game state that a token can be played in any orientation. Since the tokens are rectangular, they possess 180-degree rotational symmetry. This means a token with the digits $(a, b)$ is considered identical and indistinguishable from a token with the digits $(b, a)$. For instance, a token marked with (2, 5) is no different from a token marked with (5, 2).\n\nGiven this rule of indistinguishability, how many unique tokens are there in a complete set?", "solution": "We are counting equivalence classes of ordered pairs $(a,b)$ with $a,b \\in S=\\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$ under the relation $(a,b)\\sim(b,a)$ induced by the $180^{\\circ}$ rotation.
