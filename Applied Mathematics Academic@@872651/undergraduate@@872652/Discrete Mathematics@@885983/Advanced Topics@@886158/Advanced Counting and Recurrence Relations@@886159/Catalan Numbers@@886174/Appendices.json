A staircase polyomino of size $n$ is a two-dimensional shape made of unit squares arranged on a grid. It consists of $n$ columns of squares, indexed $i=1, 2, \\dots, n$ from left to right. For each $i$, the $i$-th column has a height of $i$ unit squares.\n\nTo optimize manufacturing, this entire staircase region must be perfectly partitioned, with no overlap and no gaps, into exactly $n$ rectangular blocks. The sides of these rectangular blocks must be aligned with the grid axes.\n\nDetermine the total number of distinct ways to perform such a partition for a staircase polyomino of size $n=10$.", "solution": "Let $T(n)$ be the number of ways to partition the staircase polyomino of size $n$ into exactly $n$ rectangles, with $T(0)=1$ for the empty shape. This is a classic problem in enumerative combinatorics. While a straightforward recursive decomposition is elusive, it can be proven via a bijection with plane binary trees or by more advanced generating function techniques that the numbers $T(n)$ satisfy the fundamental Catalan recurrence relation:\n$$\nT(n) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} T(i) T(n-1-i) \\quad \\text{for } n \\ge 1\n$$\nThis is the defining recurrence for the Catalan numbers ($C_n$).

For any sequence with a first time $t$ such that $X_{t} = -1$, reflect the prefix of length $t$ by exchanging $P$ and $S$ in that prefix. This reflection maps the prefix sum at time $t$ from $-1$ to $+1$, while leaving the remaining steps unchanged. Consequently, the final sum increases from $0$ to $2$, so the reflected sequence has $n+1$ $P$ and $n-1$ $S$.
