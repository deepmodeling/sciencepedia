You are given the sizes of two overlapping sets and their intersection, and your task is to find the size of their union.

To encourage breadth of study, courses can have multiple designations. In the list of all approved CSS courses, there are a total of 157 courses designated as 'Quantitative Methods'. Separately, there are 94 courses designated as 'Ethics in Technology'. A review of the course catalog shows that there is an overlap: exactly 36 courses are designated as both 'Quantitative Methods' and 'Ethics in Technology'.\n\nCalculate the total number of distinct courses that are designated as either 'Quantitative Methods' or 'Ethics in Technology'.", "solution": "The problem asks for the total number of distinct courses that fall into at least one of two specified categories. This is a classic application of the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion for two sets.\n\nLet's define two sets to represent the categories of courses:\nLet $Q$ be the set of courses designated as 'Quantitative Methods'.\nLet $E$ be the set of courses designated as 'Ethics in Technology'.\n\nThe problem provides the following information:\n1.  The number of courses designated as 'Quantitative Methods' is 157. In set notation, this is the size (or cardinality) of set $Q$:\n    $$|Q| = 157$$\n2.  The number of courses designated as 'Ethics in Technology' is 94. This is the cardinality of set $E$:\n    $$|E| = 94$$\n3.  The number of courses designated as both 'Quantitative Methods' and 'Ethics in Technology' is 36. This corresponds to the number of elements in the intersection of the two sets, $Q \\cap E$:\n    $$|Q \\cap E| = 36$$\n\nWe want to find the total number of distinct courses that are in either set $Q$ or set $E$. This is equivalent to finding the cardinality of the union of the two sets, denoted as $|Q \\cup E|$.\n\nThe Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion for two sets states that the size of the union of the sets is the sum of their individual sizes minus the size of their intersection:\n$$|Q \\cup E| = |Q| + |E| - |Q \\cap E|$$\n\nThe reason we subtract the intersection is that the courses in both categories are counted once when we count the elements of $Q$ and again when we count the elements of $E$. To get the correct total number of unique courses, we must subtract this overcounted group once.\n\nNow, we can substitute the given values into the formula:\n$$|Q \\cup E| = 157 + 94 - 36$$\n\nFirst, perform the addition:\n$$157 + 94 = 251$$\n\nNext, perform the subtraction:\n$$251 - 36 = 215$$\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct courses that are either 'Quantitative Methods' or 'Ethics in Technology' is 215.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{215}$$", "id": "1410019"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond problems where cardinalities are given, this exercise requires you to first determine the sizes of the sets based on their defining properties. You will explore the sets of perfect squares and perfect cubes, a classic scenario in number theory. The key insight lies in correctly identifying the intersection of these two sets, which is essential for an accurate count using the inclusion-exclusion formula [@problem_id:1410026].", "problem": "In a security audit of a cryptographic system, a set of integer keys $\\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$ is being analyzed for vulnerabilities. An integer key is classified as 'Type-S' vulnerable if it is a perfect square. An integer key is classified as 'Type-C' vulnerable if it is a perfect cube. A key is considered 'compromised' if it exhibits at least one of these two vulnerabilities (i.e., it is Type-S vulnerable, Type-C vulnerable, or both). For the case where $N = 250,000$, determine the total number of compromised keys. Your final answer must be a single integer.", "solution": "Let $S$ be the set of perfect squares in $\\{1,2,\\dots,N\\}$ and $C$ be the set of perfect cubes. The number of compromised keys is $|S \\cup C|$, which by inclusion-exclusion is\n$$\n|S \\cup C|=|S|+|C|-|S \\cap C|.\n$$\nFor $N=250000$, the count of squares is\n$$\n|S|=\\left\\lfloor \\sqrt{250000} \\right\\rfloor=\\sqrt{250000}=500,\n$$\nsince $250000=500^{2}$. The count of cubes is\n$$\n|C|=\\left\\lfloor \\sqrt[3]{250000} \\right\\rfloor=62,\n$$\nbecause $62^{3}=238328 \\le 250000 < 63^{3}=250047$.
