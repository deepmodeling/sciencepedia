An edge exists between two vertices if and only if their corresponding binary strings differ in exactly one position. A classic problem in graph theory is to determine the chromatic number of a graph. The chromatic number, denoted $\\chi(G)$, is the minimum number of colors needed to assign a color to each vertex of a graph $G$ such that no two adjacent vertices receive the same color.\n\nConsider the hypercube graph $Q_n$ for any integer $n \\geq 1$. Which of the following expressions correctly gives the chromatic number, $\\chi(Q_n)$?\n\nA. $n$\nB. $2$\nC. $n+1$\nD. $2^n$", "solution": "To determine the chromatic number $\\chi(Q_n)$ of the $n$-dimensional hypercube graph, we need to find the minimum number of colors for a valid vertex coloring. We will establish a lower bound and an upper bound for $\\chi(Q_n)$.\n\nFirst, let's establish a lower bound. For any integer $n \\ge 1$, the graph $Q_n$ is not an empty graph (a graph with no edges). For example, the vertex represented by the binary string of all zeros ('00...0') is adjacent to the vertex represented by the string '10...0', as they differ in exactly one position. Since $Q_n$ has at least one edge, we need at least two colors to ensure that the endpoints of this edge are colored differently. Therefore, the chromatic number must be at least 2.\n$$\n\\chi(Q_n) \\ge 2\n$$\n\nNext, we establish an upper bound by constructing a valid 2-coloring. If we can successfully color all vertices of $Q_n$ using only two colors, it would prove that $\\chi(Q_n) \\le 2$. A graph that can be 2-colored is known as a bipartite graph. We need to show that $Q_n$ is bipartite.\n\nTo do this, we can partition the set of vertices $V$ of $Q_n$ into two disjoint subsets, let's call them $V_0$ and $V_1$. A natural way to partition the vertices is based on the Hamming weight (the number of 1s) of their corresponding binary strings.\n\nLet $V_0$ be the set of all vertices whose binary strings have an even number of 1s.\nLet $V_1$ be the set of all vertices whose binary strings have an odd number of 1s.\n\nEvery vertex in $Q_n$ has a binary string with either an even or an odd number of 1s, so the sets $V_0$ and $V_1$ form a complete partition of the vertex set $V$. Now, we assign one color (e.g., \"Color 1\") to all vertices in $V_0$ and a second color (e.g., \"Color 2\") to all vertices in $V_1$.\n\nWe must verify that this is a valid coloring. Consider any two adjacent vertices, $u$ and $v$, in $Q_n$. By the definition of $Q_n$, their binary string representations differ in exactly one position. This means one string can be obtained from the other by flipping a single bit (a 0 to a 1, or a 1 to a 0).\nIf we flip a 0 to a 1, the number of 1s increases by one.\nIf we flip a 1 to a 0, the number of 1s decreases by one.\nIn either case, if the number of 1s in the string for $u$ is $k$, the number of 1s in the string for $v$ must be $k+1$ or $k-1$. This implies that if one of the strings has an even number of 1s, the other must have an odd number of 1s.\n\nTherefore, any pair of adjacent vertices $(u, v)$ will have one vertex in $V_0$ and the other in $V_1$. According to our coloring scheme, $u$ and $v$ will be assigned different colors. This holds for all edges in the graph. Thus, we have constructed a valid 2-coloring for $Q_n$.\n\nThis successful construction shows that the chromatic number is at most 2.\n$$\n\\chi(Q_n) \\le 2\n$$\n\nCombining our lower bound and upper bound, we have $2 \\le \\chi(Q_n) \\le 2$. This forces the chromatic number to be exactly 2 for any $n \\ge 1$.\n\n$$\n\\chi(Q_n) = 2 \\quad \\text{for all } n \\ge 1\n$$\n\nComparing this result with the given options:\nA. $n$: This would mean $\\chi(Q_3) = 3$, which is false.\nB. $2$: This is consistent with our derivation for all $n \\ge 1$.\nC. $n+1$: The degree of every vertex in $Q_n$ is $n$, so $\\chi(Q_n) \\le n+1$ is a known (but loose) upper bound from a general theorem.

For chromatic number: even cycles are $2$-colorable, odd cycles are not. In a $2$-coloring attempt for $C_5$, alternating colors around the cycle forces the fifth vertex to conflict with its neighbors, so $2$ colors are impossible; a $3$-coloring is straightforward by using two alternating colors on four consecutive vertices and a third color on the fifth. Therefore $\\chi(C_5)=3$, and $C_5$ is triangle-free.\n\nD. Cycle graph on $6$ vertices $C_6$. This is triangle-free, but since the cycle length is even, it is bipartite and hence $\\chi(C_6)=2$.
