This problem highlights the importance of careful definitions and reveals a surprising, non-intuitive result that deepens our understanding of combinatorial structures.", "problem": "In graph theory, Ramsey numbers quantify the idea that complete disorder is impossible. Given a large enough structure, some regular substructure must appear. This problem explores a variation of this concept.\n\nFirst, let's establish some definitions. A **graph** consists of a set of vertices and a set of edges connecting pairs of vertices. The **complete graph** on $n$ vertices, denoted $K_n$, is a graph where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge. A **$2$-edge-coloring** of a graph is an assignment of one of two colors (say, red and blue) to each edge. A **monochromatic subgraph** is a subgraph where all edges have the same color. A **subgraph** $H$ of a graph $G$ is a graph formed from a subset of vertices and edges of $G$. The path graph on 3 vertices, denoted $P_3$, is a graph with three vertices, say $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$, and two edges, $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$ and $\\{v_2, v_3\\}$.\n\nThe classical **Ramsey number**, $R(G, H)$, is the smallest integer $n$ such that any $2$-edge-coloring of $K_n$ must contain either a red subgraph isomorphic to $G$ or a blue subgraph isomorphic to $H$.\n\nA more constrained version involves **induced subgraphs**. A subgraph is **induced** if for any pair of vertices in the subgraph's vertex set, their connecting edge is included in the subgraph if and only if it was present in the original graph. The **induced Ramsey number**, $R_{ind}(G, H)$, is the smallest integer $n$ such that any $2$-edge-coloring of $K_n$ must contain either a red **induced** subgraph isomorphic to $G$ or a blue **induced** subgraph isomorphic to $H$.\n\nYour task is to explore the intriguing (and sometimes paradoxical) nature of these numbers for a very simple graph, the path $P_3$. Determine the values of the standard Ramsey number $R(P_3, P_3)$ and the induced Ramsey number $R_{ind}(P_3, P_3)$. If a Ramsey number does not exist (i.e., is infinite), use the value -1 to represent this.\n\nProvide the values of $R(P_3, P_3)$ and $R_{ind}(P_3, P_3)$ in that order.", "solution": "We first determine the classical Ramsey number $R(P_{3},P_{3})$.\n\nLower bound: $K_{2}$ has only one edge and thus contains no subgraph isomorphic to $P_{3}$, so there exists a $2$-edge-coloring of $K_{2}$ with no monochromatic $P_{3}$. Hence $R(P_{3},P_{3}) \\geq 3$.\n\nUpper bound: Consider any $2$-edge-coloring of $K_{3}$. The triangle has $3$ edges and only $2$ colors are available, so by the pigeonhole principle at least two edges share the same color. In $K_{3}$ any two distinct edges are adjacent (they share a vertex), so those two same-colored edges form a monochromatic copy of $P_{3}$. Therefore every $2$-edge-coloring of $K_{3}$ contains a monochromatic $P_{3}$, giving $R(P_{3},P_{3}) \\leq 3$. Combining, $R(P_{3},P_{3})=3$.\n\nNext, we determine the induced Ramsey number $R_{ind}(P_{3},P_{3})$.\n\nAn induced monochromatic copy of $P_{3}$ on vertices $\\{v_{1},v_{2},v_{3}\\}$ requires that exactly two of the three edges among these vertices have the same color and form a path, while the third edge (between the path’s endpoints) must be of the opposite color. For any $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, color all edges of $K_{n}$ red. Then for any triple of vertices, the red edges among them form a triangle $K_{3}$, not an induced $P_{3}$ (since an induced red $P_{3}$ would require the third edge to be blue), and there are no blue edges at all, so there is no induced blue $P_{3}$. Thus, for every $n$, there exists a $2$-edge-coloring of $K_{n}$ with no induced red $P_{3}$ and no induced blue $P_{3}$. Consequently, no finite $n$ satisfies the induced Ramsey property, and $R_{ind}(P_{3},P_{3})$ does not exist (is infinite). By the problem’s convention, we report this as $-1$.\n\nTherefore, the requested values are $R(P_{3},P_{3})=3$ and $R_{ind}(P_{3},P_{3})=-1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}3  -1\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1530296"}]}
