To find the expected value of $N$, we can use the method of indicator random variables.\n\nFor each index $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n-1\\}$, let's define an indicator random variable $I_i$ such that:\n$$\nI_i = \\begin{cases} 1  \\text{if } \\pi_1(i)  \\pi_1(i+1) \\text{ and } \\pi_2(i)  \\pi_2(i+1) \\\\ 0  \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe total number of such indices, $N$, can be expressed as the sum of these indicator variables:\n$$\nN = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} I_i\n$$\nBy the linearity of expectation, the expected value of $N$ is the sum of the expected values of the indicator variables:\n$$\nE[N] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} I_i\\right] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} E[I_i]\n$$\nThe expectation of an indicator random variable is the probability of the event it indicates. Therefore, $E[I_i] = P(I_i = 1)$. The event $I_i=1$ occurs if and only if both $\\pi_1$ and $\\pi_2$ have an ascent at index $i$. Let $A_i$ be the event that $\\pi_1$ has an ascent at index $i$, and $B_i$ be the event that $\\pi_2$ has an ascent at index $i$. Then:\n$$\nP(I_i = 1) = P(A_i \\cap B_i)\n$$\nThe problem states that the permutations $\\pi_1$ and $\\pi_2$ are chosen independently. This implies that the event $A_i$ (which depends only on $\\pi_1$) and the event $B_i$ (which depends only on $\\pi_2$) are independent events. Therefore, we can write:\n$$\nP(A_i \\cap B_i) = P(A_i) P(B_i)\n$$\nNow, we need to calculate the probability of an ascent at a given index $i$ for a single random permutation $\\pi$. Let's calculate $P(A_i) = P(\\pi_1(i)  \\pi_1(i+1))$.\nFor a permutation $\\pi$ chosen uniformly at random, consider the values at any two distinct positions, say $j$ and $k$. Let these values be $\\pi(j)$ and $\\pi(k)$. By symmetry, for any two distinct values $u, v \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, the event that $\\{\\pi(j), \\pi(k)\\} = \\{u, v\\}$ is equally likely. Once the two values are fixed, there are two equally likely ways to assign them to the positions $j$ and $k$: either $(\\pi(j), \\pi(k)) = (u,v)$ or $(\\pi(j), \\pi(k)) = (v,u)$. If $u  v$, one assignment results in $\\pi(j)  \\pi(k)$ and the other results in $\\pi(j)  \\pi(k)$. Therefore, the probability $P(\\pi(j)  \\pi(k))$ must be equal to $P(\\pi(j)  \\pi(k))$. Since $\\pi$ is a permutation, $\\pi(j) \\ne \\pi(k)$, so these are the only two possibilities. Thus, each must have a probability of $1/2$.\nThis argument applies to any pair of distinct positions, including the adjacent positions $i$ and $i+1$. So, for any $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n-1\\}$:\n$$\nP(A_i) = P(\\pi_1(i)  \\pi_1(i+1)) = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nSince $\\pi_2$ is drawn from the same distribution of permutations as $\\pi_1$, the same logic applies:\n$$\nP(B_i) = P(\\pi_2(i)  \\pi_2(i+1)) = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nNow we can compute the expectation of the indicator variable $I_i$:\n$$\nE[I_i] = P(I_i=1) = P(A_i)P(B_i) = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\nNotice that this probability is the same for all indices $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n-1\\}$.\nFinally, we can find the expected value of $N$ by summing the expectations of the $n-1$ indicator variables:\n$$\nE[N] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} E[I_i] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\nSince there are $n-1$ terms in the summation, the result is:\n$$\nE[N] = (n-1) \\times \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{n-1}{4}\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{n-1}{4}}$$", "id": "1365957"}]}
