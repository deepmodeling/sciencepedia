For a connected graph, an Euler trail exists if and only if the number of vertices of odd degree is either 0 or 2; if it is 0, the trail is a circuit. The complete bipartite graph $K_{m,n}$ with $m,n \\geq 1$ is connected, so this criterion applies.\n\nIn $K_{m,n}$, each of the $m$ vertices on one side has degree $n$, and each of the $n$ vertices on the other side has degree $m$. Therefore, the number of vertices of odd degree equals the number of vertices in the part whose degree is odd:\n- If $n$ is odd, then all $m$ vertices on the $m$-side have odd degree, contributing $m$ odd-degree vertices.\n- If $m$ is odd, then all $n$ vertices on the $n$-side have odd degree, contributing $n$ odd-degree vertices.\n- If $m$ is even, then the $n$-side contributes $0$ odd-degree vertices; if $n$ is even, then the $m$-side contributes $0$ odd-degree vertices.\n\nSummarizing:\n- If both $m$ and $n$ are even, the number of odd-degree vertices is $0$, so an Euler circuit (hence a traversal) exists.\n- If $m$ is odd and $n=2$, then the $m$-side vertices have degree $2$ (even) and the two vertices on the $n$-side have degree $m$ (odd), giving exactly $2$ odd-degree vertices, so an Euler trail exists. Symmetrically, if $n$ is odd and $m=2$, exactly $2$ odd-degree vertices occur, so an Euler trail exists.\n- If $m=n=1$, both vertices have degree $1$, so there are exactly $2$ odd-degree vertices and an Euler trail exists.\n- If both $m$ and $n$ are odd in general, the number of odd-degree vertices is $m+n$. This equals $2$ only when $m=n=1$; otherwise it is at least $4$, so no Euler trail exists in general. Hence the condition “both odd” is not sufficient.\n- If $m+n$ is even, then either both are even (which works) or both are odd (which generally does not work, except for $m=n=1$).
