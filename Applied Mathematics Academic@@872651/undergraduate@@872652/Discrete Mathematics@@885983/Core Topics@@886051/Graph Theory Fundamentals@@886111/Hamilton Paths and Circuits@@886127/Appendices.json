Vertex $4$ has no outgoing edge. By the definition of strong connectivity, from vertex $4$ there must be a path to every other vertex.

Note the outdegrees: $\\deg^{+}(2)=1$ with the only outgoing edge $(2,1)$, and $\\deg^{+}(4)=1$ with the only outgoing edge $(4,1)$. In any directed Hamilton circuit, each vertex has exactly one outgoing edge in the circuit, so the successor of $2$ in such a circuit must be $1$, and the successor of $4$ must also be $1$. But in any directed Hamilton circuit, each vertex has in-degree exactly $1$ within the circuit, so vertex $1$ cannot have two distinct predecessors. This contradiction shows there is no Hamilton circuit. Therefore C satisfies both required properties.\n\nOption D: $E_D=\\{(1,2),(2,3),(3,4),(4,1),(1,3),(3,1)\\}$.
