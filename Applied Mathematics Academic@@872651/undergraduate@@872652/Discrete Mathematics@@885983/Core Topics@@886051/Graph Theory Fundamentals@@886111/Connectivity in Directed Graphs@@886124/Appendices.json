The connections in this network are directional, meaning data can only flow one way along a given link. The established one-way data links are as follows:\n- From server $S_1$ to server $S_2$.\n- From server $S_1$ to server $S_3$.\n- From server $S_2$ to server $S_4$.\n- From server $S_3$ to server $S_2$.\n\nIn graph theory, we can model this network as a directed graph where the servers are the vertices and the links are the directed edges. A server $S_j$ is said to be reachable from a server $S_i$ if there is a path (a sequence of one or more links) from $S_i$ to $S_j$.

Adding two edges, one from $V_{1}$ to $V_{2}$ and one from $V_{2}$ to $V_{1}$, creates a directed cycle between $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$, and strong connectivity then follows by the same concatenation argument using the internal strong connectivity of $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$.
