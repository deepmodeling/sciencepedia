In this system, each computer is represented as a \"node,\" and a direct, two-way communication channel between two computers is represented as a \"connection.\" The design adheres to two strict rules:\n1.  A connection must link two distinct nodes; a node cannot be connected to itself.\n2.  Between any pair of nodes, there can be at most one direct connection.\n\nThese rules imply that the network topology can be modeled as a simple graph.

A **multigraph** consists of a set of vertices $V$ and a multiset of edges $E$. Each edge is an unordered pair of distinct vertices. Since $E$ is a multiset, multiple edges between the same two vertices are permitted, but loops (edges connecting a vertex to itself) are not. A simple graph is a special case of a multigraph where the multiplicity of any edge is at most one.\n\nThe **degree** of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it, where an edge of multiplicity $k$ contributes $k$ to the degree of each of its endpoints. The **degree sequence** of a graph is a list of the degrees of its vertices, typically sorted in non-increasing order.\n\nTwo multigraphs, $G_1 = (V_1, E_1)$ and $G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$, are said to be **isomorphic** if there exists a bijection (a one-to-one correspondence) $f: V_1 \\to V_2$ that preserves the edge-multiplicity structure. That is, for any pair of vertices $u, v \\in V_1$, the number of edges between $u$ and $v$ in $G_1$ must be equal to the number of edges between $f(u)$ and $f(v)$ in $G_2$.\n\nConsider multigraphs on the vertex set $V = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.
