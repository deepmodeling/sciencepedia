You are asked to evaluate a proposed network design by simply summing the connections (degrees) of all nodes [@problem_id:1408468]. This practice reinforces the lemma's most immediate consequence: the sum of degrees in any simple graph must be an even number, providing a swift method to identify impossible configurations.", "problem": "In a clandestine intelligence agency, the spymaster, \"M\", is designing a secure, point-to-point communication network for a critical mission involving 14 field agents. The network is modeled as a graph where each agent is a vertex and a direct, secure communication line between two agents is an edge. M's junior analyst proposes a network configuration with the following specifications for the number of direct contacts each agent should have:\n\n- Seven of the agents will each have exactly 5 direct contacts.\n- The other seven agents will each have exactly 4 direct contacts.\n\nM reviews the proposal and immediately identifies a fundamental flaw, rendering the proposed network impossible to construct. Which of the following statements provides the correct reason for the impossibility of this network design?\n\nA. The proposed network is impossible because the total number of communication links' endpoints (the sum of contacts for all spies) must be an even number.\n\nB. The proposed network is impossible because with 14 spies, no single spy can have fewer than 6 contacts for the network to be secure.\n\nC. The proposed network is impossible because it would force the network to be split into two disconnected groups of seven.\n\nD. The proposed network is perfectly feasible and can be constructed in multiple ways.\n\nE. The proposed network is impossible because the number of spies with an odd number of contacts must be zero.", "solution": "Model the network as a simple undirected graph with vertex set of size $14$, where each vertex represents an agent and each edge represents a mutual direct contact. By the handshaking lemma, the sum of the degrees over all vertices equals twice the number of edges:\n$$\n\\sum_{v \\in V} \\deg(v) = 2|E|.\n$$\nTherefore, the left-hand side must be an even integer. The proposed degree sequence assigns degree $5$ to seven vertices and degree $4$ to seven vertices, so the total sum of degrees is\n$$\n7 \\cdot 5 + 7 \\cdot 4 = 35 + 28 = 63.\n$$\nSince $63$ is odd, it cannot equal $2|E|$, which is even. This contradiction shows the proposed network is impossible. This matches statement A. Note that an equivalent obstruction is that the number of vertices with odd degree must be even, while here there are $7$ such vertices; however, statement E incorrectly claims this number must be zero, not merely even.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1408468"}, {"introduction": "This practice moves from validation to quantification, demonstrating how the Handshaking Lemma is a crucial tool for analyzing network evolution.
