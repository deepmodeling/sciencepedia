In the complement graph $\\bar{G}$, an edge exists between two vertices if and only if there is no edge between them in the original graph $G$.\n\nA key design requirement is structural symmetry: the original network $G$ must be isomorphic to its complementary network $\\bar{G}$.

The set of edges $\\bar{E}$ consists of all pairs of vertices that are not connected in $G$.\n\nThe total number of possible edges in a simple graph with $n$ vertices is the number of edges in a complete graph $K_n$, which is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{2}$. This represents all possible pairs of vertices. The set of edges in $G$ and the set of edges in $\\bar{G}$ are disjoint, and their union is the set of all possible edges in $K_n$. Therefore, the number of edges must satisfy the relation:\n$$|E| + |\\bar{E}| = \\binom{n}{2}$$\n\nThe problem states that the graph $G$ is isomorphic to its complement $\\bar{G}$. A fundamental property of graph isomorphism is that two isomorphic graphs must have the same number of vertices and the same number of edges. Since $G$ and $\\bar{G}$ are isomorphic, they must have the same number of edges.\n$$|E| = |\\bar{E}|$$\n\nLet $m = |E|$. Substituting this into the first equation, we get:\n$$m + m = \\binom{n}{2}$$\n$$2m = \\binom{n}{2}$$\n\nThis gives us a formula for the number of edges in any self-complementary graph:\n$$m = \\frac{1}{2} \\binom{n}{2}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the given number of vertices, $n=5$, into this formula to find the number of edges in our specific network $G$.\n$$m = \\frac{1}{2} \\binom{5}{2}$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the binomial coefficient $\\binom{5}{2}$:\n$$\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5!}{2!3!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1}{(2 \\times 1)(3 \\times 2 \\times 1)} = \\frac{120}{2 \\times 6} = \\frac{120}{12} = 10$$\n\nNow, we can find $m$:\n$$m = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 10 = 5$$\n\nSo, the network $G$ must have exactly 5 edges.\n\nThe problem also specifies that the graph $G$ must be connected. We should verify that it is possible to construct a connected graph with 5 vertices and 5 edges that is also self-complementary. A well-known example is the cycle graph on 5 vertices, $C_5$. This graph is connected, has 5 vertices, and 5 edges. Its complement, $\\bar{C_5}$, is also a 5-cycle. Since $C_5$ is isomorphic to itself, it is indeed isomorphic to its complement.
