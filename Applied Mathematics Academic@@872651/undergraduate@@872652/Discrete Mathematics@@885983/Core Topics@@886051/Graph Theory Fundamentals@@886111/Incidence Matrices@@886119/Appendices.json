This problem shifts the focus to encoding a graph, using the complete graph $K_4$ as a case study. Instead of just constructing the matrix, this exercise asks you to deduce a global property—the sum of all its entries—which reinforces the fundamental principle that every edge corresponds to a column with exactly two non-zero entries in a simple graph [@problem_id:1533135].", "problem": "In graph theory, a simple graph is an undirected graph that does not contain any loops (edges connecting a vertex to itself) or multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.

For a graph with $p$ vertices and $q$ edges, the incidence matrix is a $p \\times q$ matrix where the rows correspond to the vertices and the columns correspond to the edges.

Its incidence matrix can be rearranged into a block-diagonal form by permuting its rows and columns. The rearrangement procedure is as follows:\n1.  The vertices are partitioned into their connected components. The components are then ordered according to the smallest vertex index contained within each component.\n2.
