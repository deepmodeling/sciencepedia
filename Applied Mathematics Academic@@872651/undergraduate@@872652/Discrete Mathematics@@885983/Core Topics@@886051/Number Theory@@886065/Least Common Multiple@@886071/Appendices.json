{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To begin our hands-on exploration, we'll start with a problem that reinforces the most fundamental connection between the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM). The identity $\\gcd(a, b) \\cdot \\text{lcm}(a, b) = a \\cdot b$ is a cornerstone of elementary number theory. This exercise invites you to apply this theorem directly, demonstrating how knowing the GCD and LCM of two integers provides powerful constraints on what those integers can be. By working through this problem [@problem_id:1380764], you will transform a number theory puzzle into a structured counting problem, building a solid foundation for the more complex scenarios ahead.", "problem": "In the study of a newly discovered extra-solar celestial object, scientists have found that it houses two distinct crystalline structures, Alpha and Beta. These structures emit energy pulses at highly regular, but different, intervals. Let the pulse period of the Alpha structure be $a$ picoseconds and the Beta structure be $b$ picoseconds, where $a$ and $b$ are positive integers.\n\nFrom the analysis of the combined energy signal, two key properties have been established:\n1. The greatest common divisor of the two pulse periods, $a$ and $b$, is determined to be exactly 5 picoseconds.\n2. If both structures pulse simultaneously at a reference time $t=0$, the very next time they pulse together is at $t=150$ picoseconds. This time corresponds to the least common multiple of their periods.\n\nHow many distinct ordered pairs of positive integers $(a, b)$ are consistent with these observations?", "solution": "Let $a$ and $b$ be positive integers with $\\gcd(a,b)=5$ and $\\text{lcm}(a,b)=150$.
