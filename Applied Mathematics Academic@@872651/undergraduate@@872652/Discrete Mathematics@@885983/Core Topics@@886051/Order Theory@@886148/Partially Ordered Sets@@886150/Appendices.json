The divisors of 72 are:\n$$ D_{72} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72\\} $$\nThe poset is $(D_{72}, \\mid)$, where $\\mid$ is the divisibility relation. The subset in question is $S = \\{6, 8\\}$.\n\n**Step 1: Find the set of all upper bounds of S.**\n\nAn element $u \\in D_{72}$ is an upper bound for the subset $S$ if for every element $s \\in S$, we have $s \\mid u$. In this case, an upper bound $u$ must be divisible by both 6 and 8.\nAn integer that is divisible by both 6 and 8 must be a common multiple of 6 and 8. The common multiples of two integers are the multiples of their least common multiple (lcm).\n\nLet's calculate the least common multiple of 6 and 8.\nThe prime factorization of 6 is $2^1 \\times 3^1$.\nThe prime factorization of 8 is $2^3$.\nThe lcm is found by taking the highest power of each prime factor present in either factorization.\n$$ \\text{lcm}(6, 8) = 2^{\\max(1,3)} \\times 3^{\\max(1,0)} = 2^3 \\times 3^1 = 8 \\times 3 = 24 $$\nSo, any upper bound of $S$ must be a multiple of 24.\n\nNow, we need to find which of these multiples of 24 are actually elements of the set $D_{72}$.\nThe multiples of 24 are $24, 48, 72, 96, \\dots$.\nWe check which of these belong to $D_{72} = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72\\}$.\n- Is 24 in $D_{72}$? Yes, $72 = 3 \\times 24$.\n- Is 48 in $D_{72}$? No, 72 is not divisible by 48.\n- Is 72 in $D_{72}$? Yes, $72 = 1 \\times 72$.\n- Any multiple of 24 greater than 72 cannot be a divisor of 72.\n\nTherefore, the set of all upper bounds of $S = \\{6, 8\\}$ in $D_{72}$ is $\\{24, 72\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Find the least upper bound (supremum) of S.**\n\nThe least upper bound (supremum) of $S$, denoted $\\sup(S)$, is the unique upper bound that is \"smaller\" than all other upper bounds in the sense of the partial order. That is, if $U$ is the set of all upper bounds, the supremum is an element $l \\in U$ such that for all $u \\in U$, we have $l \\mid u$.\n\nThe set of upper bounds is $U = \\{24, 72\\}$.\nWe need to find an element in this set which divides all other elements in the set.\n- Check 24: Does 24 divide 24? Yes. Does 24 divide 72? Yes, because $72 = 3 \\times 24$.\n- Check 72: Does 72 divide 24? No.\n\nSince 24 divides every element in the set of upper bounds $\\{24, 72\\}$, it is the least element of the set of upper bounds with respect to the divisibility relation. Thus, the least upper bound (supremum) of $S$ is 24.\n\n**Step 3: Match the findings with the given options.**\n\nOur findings are:\n- The set of upper bounds is $\\{24, 72\\}$.\n- The least upper bound is 24.\n\nThis corresponds exactly to option A.\nLet's analyze the other options to see why they are incorrect:\n- B: Incorrectly claims $\\{24\\}$ is the complete set of upper bounds. It omits 72.\n- C: Incorrectly includes 48 in the set of upper bounds. 48 is not a divisor of 72.\n- D: Incorrectly identifies the set of upper bounds and the least upper bound. 24 is also an upper bound, and is smaller than 72 in the poset ordering.\n- E: Correctly identifies the set of upper bounds but incorrectly identifies the least upper bound as 72.

Hence the only element with no strictly larger comparable element is $180$ itself. Therefore the number of maximal elements is $1$.\n\nHeight: A chain corresponds to increasing the exponent vector $(i,j,k)$ by unit steps until reaching $(2,2,1)$ from $(0,0,0)$. The maximum number of steps is $(2+2+1)$, so the number of elements in a longest chain is $(2+2+1)+1=6$. Thus the height is $6$.\n\nWidth: The poset is graded by the rank function $r(i,j,k) = i+j+k$. Any two distinct elements with the same rank are incomparable because if $(i,j,k) \\le (i',j',k')$ componentwise and $(i,j,k) \\ne (i',j',k')$, then $i+j+k  i'+j'+k'$, contradicting equality of ranks. Hence each rank level is an antichain, and the width equals the maximum size of a rank level.
