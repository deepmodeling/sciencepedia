The formal definitions for the properties of such a tree are as follows:\n\n- A **rooted tree** is a collection of nodes called **vertices** connected by directed **edges**, such that there is one specially designated vertex, the **root**, and for every other vertex, there is a unique path of edges leading from the root to it.\n- If an edge exists from vertex $u$ to vertex $v$, $u$ is called the **parent** of $v$, and $v$ is a **child** of $u$.\n- A vertex that has no children is called a **leaf**. A vertex that has at least one child is called an **internal vertex**.\n- The **level** of a vertex is the number of edges in the unique path from the root to that vertex. The root is at level 0.\n- The **height** of a rooted tree is the maximum level of any vertex in the tree.\n\nConsider a specific rooted tree that is known to have exactly 20 vertices and a height of 5. What is the maximum possible number of leaves this tree can have?", "solution": "Let $N$ be the total number of vertices, $h$ the height, $L$ the number of leaves, and $I$ the number of internal vertices. For any rooted tree,\n$$\nN = L + I.\n$$\nGiven $h=5$, there must exist a path of length $5$ from the root to some vertex, i.e., vertices at levels $0,1,2,3,4,5$. The vertices at levels $0$ through $4$ each have at least one child (the next vertex on the path), so they are internal. Hence,\n$$\nI \\geq 6.\n$$\nThe root and the vertices at levels 1, 2, 3, and 4 must be internal to form the path of length 5. That is 5 internal nodes. The vertex at the end of the path (level 5) is a leaf. So there is a path of 6 vertices. This means there are at least 5 internal vertices along this single path to guarantee a height of 5.\n$$\nI \\geq 5.\n$$\nWith $N=20$, this implies\n$$\nL = N - I \\leq 20 - 5 = 15.\n$$\nTo show this bound is attainable, we can construct such a tree. Create a single path of 6 vertices from the root (at level 0) to a leaf (at level 5). This uses 6 vertices and establishes the height of 5. The 5 vertices at levels 0 through 4 are internal nodes, and the vertex at level 5 is a leaf. We have $20 - 6 = 14$ vertices remaining. We can attach these 14 vertices as children to any of the 5 internal nodes already created (for example, make them all children of the root). These 14 newly added vertices will be leaves.\nThe total number of leaves is the one leaf at the end of our initial path plus the 14 new leaves, so $L = 1 + 14 = 15$.\nThe total number of internal vertices is the 5 on the initial path, so $I = 5$.\nThe total number of vertices is $N = L + I = 15 + 5 = 20$. The height is 5.\nThis construction is valid.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of leaves is 15.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{15}$$", "id": "1397568"}, {"introduction": "While general rooted trees are flexible, certain applications demand more structured forms like the full binary tree, where every node has either zero or two children.

This structure is modeled as a rooted tree where each node represents a task. In this tree, a node is called an **internal node** if it has at least one child, and a **leaf node** if it has no children. The company's design mandates that this tree must be a **full binary tree**, which is a tree where every node has either zero or exactly two children.\n\nThe tasks are run on two different types of virtual machines. Internal nodes, which perform computation and routing, run on 'Processing' machines. Leaf nodes, which represent final outputs or data storage points, run on 'Storage' machines. The daily operational cost for a single 'Processing' machine is $350, and for a single 'Storage' machine is $120.\n\nIf the data structure is designed to have exactly 125 internal nodes, what is the total daily operational cost for all the machines required to run this entire task tree? Express your answer in dollars.", "solution": "The problem asks for the total daily operational cost of a hierarchical task structure modeled as a full binary tree. The cost is determined by the number of internal nodes and leaf nodes.\n\nFirst, let's define the variables based on the information given in the problem statement:\n- Let $I$ be the number of internal nodes. We are given $I = 125$.\n- Let $L$ be the number of leaf nodes. This value is currently unknown.\n- Let $C_P$ be the cost of a 'Processing' machine for an internal node. We are given $C_P = 350$ dollars.\n- Let $C_S$ be the cost of a 'Storage' machine for a leaf node. We are given $C_S = 120$ dollars.\n\nThe total daily operational cost, let's call it $C_{\\text{total}}$, can be expressed as the sum of the costs for all internal nodes and all leaf nodes:\n$$C_{\\text{total}} = (I \\times C_P) + (L \\times C_S)$$\n\nTo find $C_{\\text{total}}$, we first need to determine the value of $L$. The problem states the tree is a **full binary tree**. For any non-empty full binary tree, there is a fundamental relationship between the number of internal nodes ($I$) and the number of leaf nodes ($L$). This relationship is $L = I + 1$.\n\nWe can derive this property as follows. Let $n$ be the total number of nodes in the tree. By definition, every node is either an internal node or a leaf node, so $n = I + L$.\nAnother way to count the nodes is by considering the parent-child relationships. Every node in the tree, except for the root, has exactly one parent. Therefore, the total number of children in the tree is $n-1$.\nIn a full binary tree, only internal nodes have children, and each internal node has exactly two children. So, the total number of children can also be expressed as $2 \\times I$.\nBy equating the two expressions for the total number of children, we get:\n$$n - 1 = 2I$$\nNow, we substitute $n = I + L$ into this equation:\n$$(I + L) - 1 = 2I$$\nSubtracting $I$ from both sides gives:\n$$L - 1 = I$$\n$$L = I + 1$$\nThis confirms the relationship for any non-empty full binary tree.\n\nNow we can use this relationship to find the number of leaf nodes in our specific tree. Given $I = 125$:\n$$L = 125 + 1 = 126$$\n\nSo, the data structure has 125 internal nodes and 126 leaf nodes. We can now calculate the total daily cost using the cost formula:\n$$C_{\\text{total}} = (I \\times C_P) + (L \\times C_S)$$\nSubstitute the known values:\n$$C_{\\text{total}} = (125 \\times 350) + (126 \\times 120)$$\n\nLet's calculate each part:\nCost for internal nodes:\n$$125 \\times 350 = 43750$$\nCost for leaf nodes:\n$$126 \\times 120 = 15120$$\n\nFinally, sum these costs to find the total cost:\n$$C_{\\text{total}} = 43750 + 15120 = 58870$$\n\nThe total daily operational cost for the entire task tree is $58870.
