The system generates unique access codes by creating an arrangement of all the letters from the set {S, U, B, D, O, M, A, I, N}. According to the system's design specification, a valid access code must adhere to two strict rules: the first character must be a vowel (A, E, I, O, U), and the last character must be a consonant. All letters in the set must be used exactly once in each generated code. How many distinct valid access codes can be generated by this system?", "solution": "The problem asks for the number of distinct arrangements (permutations) of a set of letters subject to specific constraints on the first and last positions. We can solve this by using the multiplication principle of counting.\n\nFirst, let's identify the characteristics of the given set of letters: {S, U, B, D, O, M, A, I, N}.\nThe total number of distinct letters is $n = 9$.\n\nNext, we partition this set into vowels and consonants.\nThe vowels in the set are {U, O, A, I}. The number of vowels is $n_v = 4$.\nThe consonants in the set are {S, B, D, M, N}. The number of consonants is $n_c = 5$.\nAs a check, we can confirm that $n_v + n_c = 4 + 5 = 9 = n$.\n\nWe need to construct a 9-letter arrangement that starts with a vowel and ends with a consonant. Let's consider the number of choices we have for each position in the arrangement.\n\nStep 1: Choose the first letter.\nThe first character of the access code must be a vowel. There are $n_v = 4$ available vowels, so there are 4 choices for the first position.\n\nStep 2: Choose the last letter.\nThe last character of the access code must be a consonant. There are $n_c = 5$ available consonants, so there are 5 choices for the last position. The choice for the last position is independent of the choice for the first position.\n\nStep 3: Arrange the remaining letters.\nAfter placing a vowel in the first position and a consonant in the last position, we have used 2 letters from the original set of 9. This leaves $9 - 2 = 7$ letters to be arranged in the 7 middle positions (positions 2 through 8). These 7 remaining letters can be any combination of the unused vowels and consonants.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange $k$ distinct items is given by $k!$ (k-factorial). In this case, we need to arrange the 7 remaining distinct letters. The number of ways to do this is $7!$.\n\n$7! = 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 5040$.\n\nStep 4: Combine the results using the multiplication principle.\nThe total number of distinct valid access codes is the product of the number of choices for each step:\nTotal arrangements = (Choices for the first position) $\\times$ (Choices for the last position) $\\times$ (Arrangements for the middle positions)\nTotal arrangements = $4 \\times 5 \\times 7!$\n\nNow, we substitute the value of $7!$:\nTotal arrangements = $4 \\times 5 \\times 5040$\nTotal arrangements = $20 \\times 5040$\nTotal arrangements = $100800$.\n\nTherefore, there are 100,800 distinct valid access codes that can be generated by the system.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{100800}$$", "id": "1390701"}, {"introduction": "Counting arrangements becomes more interesting when the layout isn't a straight line.

The eight members are to be seated at a large circular conference table. For logistical and political reasons, the seating arrangement must satisfy two conditions: the Lead Physicist and the Lead Biologist must sit in adjacent seats, while the representatives from Company A and Company B must not sit in adjacent seats. How many distinct seating arrangements are possible?", "solution": "Let the eight distinct members be: Lead Physicist (P), Lead Biologist (B), Chief Engineer, Medical Officer, Ethics Advisor, Communications Specialist, and two corporate representatives from rival companies, Company A and Company B. To avoid ambiguity with the Biologist (B), we denote the representatives by A and C. The constraints are: P and B must be adjacent, and A and C must not be adjacent.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of arrangements where P and B are adjacent, using the \"block\" method. We treat (P, B) as a single unit. This unit can be internally arranged in $2! = 2$ ways (PB or BP). Now, we are arranging 7 items (the PB-block and the 6 other individuals) around a circular table. The number of circular permutations of $n$ items is $(n-1)!$.\nTotal arrangements with P and B adjacent = $2 \\times (7-1)! = 2 \\times 6! = 2 \\times 720 = 1440$.\n\nNext, we use complementary counting. From this total, we subtract the number of arrangements where A and C *are* adjacent.\nTo count these unwanted arrangements, we treat both (P, B) and (A, C) as blocks. The (P, B) block has 2 internal arrangements. The (A, C) block also has 2 internal arrangements.

The scrambling process is governed by a permutation $\\pi$ of the set $S = \\{1, 2, ..., 12\\}$. A permutation is a bijection from a set to itself. The specific permutation $\\pi$ used by the machine is given in cycle notation as:\n$$ \\pi = (1\\ 2\\ 3\\ 4)(5\\ 6\\ 7\\ 8\\ 9\\ 10\\ 11\\ 12) $$\nThis notation means that for the first cycle $(1\\ 2\\ 3\\ 4)$, channel 1 is mapped to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4, and 4 back to 1. The elements in the second cycle are mapped similarly. Elements not in a cycle of length greater than one are implicitly fixed. However, in this case, all elements of $S$ are included in the cycles shown.\n\nFor one full cycle of operation, the machine applies this permutation four times in succession. The resulting transformation is thus described by the permutation $\\pi^4$, which is the composition of $\\pi$ with itself four times.\n\nA channel is considered \"unscrambled\" by this process if it is a fixed point of the overall transformation $\\pi^4$.

A channel $x$ is unscrambled if and only if it is a fixed point of $\\pi^{4}$, i.e., $\\pi^{4}(x)=x$.\n\nA fundamental property of permutations in cycle form is that if an element $x$ belongs to a cycle of length $L$ in a permutation $\\pi$, then $\\pi^k(x) = x$ if and only if $L$ is a divisor of $k$.\n\nWe apply this property to each disjoint cycle of $\\pi$ with the power $k=4$:\n\n1.  **First Cycle:** The cycle $(1\\ 2\\ 3\\ 4)$ has a length of $L_1 = 4$. We check if $L_1$ divides $k=4$. Since $4$ divides $4$, every element in this cycle will be a fixed point of $\\pi^4$. These elements are $1, 2, 3, 4$. So, there are 4 unscrambled channels from this cycle.\n\n2.  **Second Cycle:** The cycle $(5\\ 6\\ 7\\ 8\\ 9\\ 10\\ 11\\ 12)$ has a length of $L_2 = 8$. We check if $L_2$ divides $k=4$.
