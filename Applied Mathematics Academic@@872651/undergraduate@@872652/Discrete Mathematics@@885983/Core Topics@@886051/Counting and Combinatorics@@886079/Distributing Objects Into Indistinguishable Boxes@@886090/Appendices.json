This practice involves dividing $n$ items into $n-1$ non-empty groups, a special case that illuminates the core logic behind Stirling numbers of the second kind, $S(n, k)$. By analyzing the structure of such a partition, we can derive a surprisingly simple and elegant formula, offering a great first step into solving set partition problems [@problem_id:1365865].", "problem": "A university research committee is reviewing $n$ distinct grant proposals for a new funding initiative. The committee has decided to form exactly $n-1$ new, indistinguishable research collaborations to carry out the projects. Every proposal must be assigned to a collaboration, and every collaboration must be assigned at least one proposal. Find a closed-form analytic expression for the total number of ways the committee can assign the $n$ proposals to the $n-1$ collaborations, in terms of $n$, assuming $n \\ge 2$.", "solution": "We are assigning $n$ distinct proposals to exactly $n-1$ collaborations that are indistinguishable, with each collaboration nonempty. This is the number of set partitions of an $n$-element set into exactly $n-1$ nonempty unlabeled blocks, which equals $S(n,n-1)$, the Stirling number of the second kind.\n\nLet the block sizes be $s_{1},\\dots,s_{n-1}$ with each $s_{i}\\ge 1$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1} s_{i}=n$.

This exercise builds on the concept of set partitions by adding a common requirement: that certain distinct items must be grouped together. By working through this museum curator's challenge, you will learn a powerful combinatorial technique known as 'fusing' elements, which simplifies the problem by treating the constrained items as a single unit [@problem_id:1365819].", "problem": "A museum curator is tasked with organizing a new exhibit featuring 8 distinct, priceless historical artifacts. The artifacts are to be placed into exactly 4 identical, non-empty display cases.

The museum's policy mandates that this pair—the coin and the die—must be displayed in the same case.

The specified coin and die must be in the same block. Fuse this required pair into a single super-item; then we are partitioning a set of 7 distinct elements (the fused pair plus the remaining 6 distinct artifacts) into 4 non-empty unlabeled blocks.
