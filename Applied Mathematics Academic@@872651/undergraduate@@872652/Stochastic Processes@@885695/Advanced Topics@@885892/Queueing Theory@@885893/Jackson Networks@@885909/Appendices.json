This first practice provides a direct application of this powerful theorem to a familiar scenario—a fast-food restaurant. By modeling the restaurant as two service stations in sequence, you will calculate the specific probability of finding a certain number of customers at each station, providing a concrete example of how independent queue behaviors combine to define the overall system state [@problem_id:1312949].", "problem": "A fast-food restaurant, QuickBurger, can be modeled as a system of two sequential service stations.

Let Station 1 be the Initial Processing Unit and Station 2 be the Secondary Verification Unit. We need to find the expected number of jobs in Station 2, denoted as $L_2$.\n\nFirst, we must express all rates in consistent units. We will use jobs per minute.\n\nThe external arrival rate to the system is given as $\\gamma = 8$ jobs per minute. All these arrivals are directed to Station 1. Thus, the external arrival rate to Station 1 is $\\gamma_1 = 8$ jobs/min, and the external arrival rate to Station 2 is $\\gamma_2 = 0$.\n\nNext, we calculate the service rates for each station. The service rate $\\mu$ is the reciprocal of the mean service time.\n\nFor Station 1, the mean service time is 5 seconds. We convert this to minutes:\nMean service time at Station 1 = $5 \\text{ seconds} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ minute}}{60 \\text{ seconds}} = \\frac{5}{60} \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{1}{12}$ minutes.\nThe service rate for Station 1 is therefore:\n$\\mu_1 = \\frac{1}{1/12 \\text{ minutes/job}} = 12$ jobs/min.\n\nFor Station 2, the mean service time is 12 seconds. We convert this to minutes:\nMean service time at Station 2 = $12 \\text{ seconds} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ minute}}{60 \\text{ seconds}} = \\frac{12}{60} \\text{ minutes} = \\frac{1}{5}$ minutes.\nThe service rate for Station 2 is therefore:\n$\\mu_2 = \\frac{1}{1/5 \\text{ minutes/job}} = 5$ jobs/min.\n\nThe routing probabilities are given as:\n$p_{12} = 0.25$ (from Station 1 to Station 2)\n$p_{10} = 0.75$ (from Station 1 to leaving the system)\n$p_{20} = 1.00$ (from Station 2 to leaving the system)\nThere is no routing from Station 2 back to Station 1, so $p_{21} = 0$.\n\nNow, we must find the total arrival rate, $\\lambda_i$, to each station $i$. The flow balance equations for an open Jackson network are:\n$\\lambda_i = \\gamma_i + \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\lambda_j p_{ji}$\n\nFor Station 1:\n$\\lambda_1 = \\gamma_1 + \\lambda_1 p_{11} + \\lambda_2 p_{21}$\nSince no jobs are routed from Station 1 to itself ($p_{11}=0$) or from Station 2 to Station 1 ($p_{21}=0$), this simplifies to:\n$\\lambda_1 = \\gamma_1 = 8$ jobs/min.\n\nFor Station 2:\n$\\lambda_2 = \\gamma_2 + \\lambda_1 p_{12} + \\lambda_2 p_{22}$\nWe have $\\gamma_2=0$, $p_{12}=0.25$, and no jobs are routed from Station 2 to itself ($p_{22}=0$). So,\n$\\lambda_2 = 0 + \\lambda_1 (0.25) + 0 = 0.25 \\lambda_1$.\nSubstituting the value of $\\lambda_1$:\n$\\lambda_2 = 0.25 \\times 8 = 2$ jobs/min.\n\nBefore proceeding, we check the stability condition for each queue, which is $\\lambda_i  \\mu_i$.\nFor Station 1: $\\lambda_1 = 8$ and $\\mu_1 = 12$. Since $8  12$, the queue is stable.\nFor Station 2: $\\lambda_2 = 2$ and $\\mu_2 = 5$. Since $2  5$, the queue is stable.\nThe system is stable, so a steady-state solution exists.\n\nAccording to Jackson's theorem, each station in an open network behaves as an independent M/M/1 queue. The expected number of customers $L$ in an M/M/1 queue is given by the formula $L = \\frac{\\rho}{1-\\rho}$, where $\\rho = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\mu}$ is the traffic intensity.\n\nFor Station 2, the traffic intensity is:\n$\\rho_2 = \\frac{\\lambda_2}{\\mu_2} = \\frac{2}{5} = 0.4$.\n\nThe expected number of jobs in Station 2, $L_2$, is:\n$L_2 = \\frac{\\rho_2}{1-\\rho_2} = \\frac{2/5}{1-2/5} = \\frac{2/5}{3/5} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$L_2 = \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.66666...$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $0.667$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.667}$$", "id": "1313000"}]}
