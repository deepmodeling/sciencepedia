We can leverage this property for a direct calculation. Let us consider the function $f(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^{2}$. The differential of this function is $df(x) = f'(x)dx = x\\,dx$. Applying the chain rule in the context of Stratonovich calculus for the process $f(B_t)$ gives:\n$$\nd(f(B_t)) = f'(B_t) \\circ dB_t\n$$\nSubstituting $f(B_t) = \\frac{1}{2}B_t^{2}$ and $f'(B_t) = B_t$, we obtain:\n$$\nd\\left(\\frac{1}{2}B_t^{2}\\right) = B_t \\circ dB_t\n$$\nIntegrating this differential expression from $s=0$ to $s=t$ yields:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t} d\\left(\\frac{1}{2}B_s^{2}\\right) = \\int_{0}^{t} B_s \\circ dB_s\n$$\nThe integral on the left-hand side is the change in the function $\\frac{1}{2}B_s^{2}$ from $s=0$ to $s=t$, which is $\\frac{1}{2}B_t^{2} - \\frac{1}{2}B_0^{2}$. Given the initial condition $B_0 = 0$, this simplifies to $\\frac{1}{2}B_t^{2}$. Therefore, we arrive at the closed-form expression for the Stratonovich integral:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t} B_s \\circ dB_s = \\frac{1}{2}B_t^{2}\n$$\nNext, as required by the problem, we compute the corresponding Itô integral $\\int_{0}^{t} B_s \\, dB_s$ and demonstrate consistency. To compute the Itô integral, we apply the Itô formula to the same function $f(B_t) = \\frac{1}{2}B_t^{2}$. The Itô formula for a function of an Itô process, in this case the standard Brownian motion $B_t$, is:\n$$\ndf(B_t) = f'(B_t)dB_t + \\frac{1}{2}f''(B_t)d[B]_t\n$$\nThe derivatives of $f(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^{2}$ are $f'(x) = x$ and $f''(x) = 1$. The quadratic variation of a standard Brownian motion is given as $[B]_t = t$, so its differential form is $d[B]_t = dt$. Substituting these into the Itô formula, we get:\n$$\nd\\left(\\frac{1}{2}B_t^{2}\\right) = B_t \\, dB_t + \\frac{1}{2}(1)dt\n$$\nIntegrating from $s=0$ to $s=t$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t} d\\left(\\frac{1}{2}B_s^{2}\\right) = \\int_{0}^{t} B_s \\, dB_s + \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{1}{2}ds\n$$\nEvaluating the terms, we have $\\frac{1}{2}B_t^{2} - \\frac{1}{2}B_0^{2}$ on the left, which is $\\frac{1}{2}B_t^{2}$, and $\\frac{1}{2}t$ for the second integral on the right. This yields the equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}B_t^{2} = \\int_{0}^{t} B_s \\, dB_s + \\frac{1}{2}t\n$$\nSolving for the Itô integral, we find:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t} B_s \\, dB_s = \\frac{1}{2}B_t^{2} - \\frac{1}{2}t\n$$\nFinally, we demonstrate the consistency between the Itô and Stratonovich integrals using the general conversion formula, which relates the two for an integrand $X_s$ and integrator $Y_s$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t} X_s \\circ dY_s = \\int_{0}^{t} X_s \\, dY_s + \\frac{1}{2}[X, Y]_t\n$$\nIn our specific case, $X_s = B_s$ and $Y_s = B_s$. The quadratic covariation $[B, B]_t$ is identical to the quadratic variation $[B]_t$. The formula thus becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t} B_s \\circ dB_s = \\int_{0}^{t} B_s \\, dB_s + \\frac{1}{2}[B]_t\n$$\nUsing the given fact that $[B]_t = t$, we have:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t} B_s \\circ dB_s = \\int_{0}^{t} B_s \\, dB_s + \\frac{1}{2}t\n$$\nWe can now verify this relationship using the expressions we derived. Substituting our result for the Stratonovich integral on the left-hand side and our result for the Itô integral on the right-hand side:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}B_t^{2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}B_t^{2} - \\frac{1}{2}t\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}t\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}B_t^{2} = \\frac{1}{2}B_t^{2}\n$$\nThe equality holds, which confirms the consistency of our results with the established theory connecting Itô and Stratonovich integrals.
