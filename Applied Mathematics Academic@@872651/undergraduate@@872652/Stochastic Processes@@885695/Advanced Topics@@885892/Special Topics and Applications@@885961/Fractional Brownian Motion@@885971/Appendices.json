The Hurst parameter $H$ plays a crucial role in determining the spread, or variance, of this distribution.

It is characterized by a parameter $H \\in (0, 1)$ called the Hurst parameter. For any fixed time $t  0$, the value of the process, $B_H(t)$, is a normally distributed random variable with a mean of zero.\n\nThe variance of the process at time $t$ is given by the formula $Var(B_H(t)) = \\sigma^2 t^{2H}$, where $\\sigma$ is a positive constant scaling factor. For the specific family of fBm processes considered in this problem, the scaling factor $\\sigma$ is always chosen such that the variance at time $t=1$ is unity, i.e., $Var(B_H(1)) = 1$.\n\nLet $\\Phi(z)$ denote the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a standard normal random variable $Z \\sim N(0,1)$.\n\nDetermine the value of the Hurst parameter $H$ for which the probability that the process $B_H(t)$ at time $t = 4$ is less than $-2$ is equal to $\\Phi(-1)$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the Hurst parameter $H$ under a specific probability constraint. The solution involves several steps: first, determining the scaling factor $\\sigma$ from the given normalization condition; second, characterizing the distribution of the process at the specified time; and third, setting up and solving an equation for $H$.\n\nFirst, we use the given condition that the variance of the process at time $t=1$ is unity. The variance formula is $Var(B_H(t)) = \\sigma^2 t^{2H}$. At $t=1$, this becomes:\n$$Var(B_H(1)) = \\sigma^2 (1)^{2H} = \\sigma^2 \\cdot 1 = \\sigma^2$$\nWe are given that $Var(B_H(1)) = 1$, so we must have $\\sigma^2 = 1$. Since $\\sigma$ is a positive constant, we conclude that $\\sigma = 1$. This simplifies the variance formula for this family of processes to $Var(B_H(t)) = t^{2H}$.\n\nNext, we consider the process at the specific time $t=4$. As stated in the problem, $B_H(t)$ is a normally distributed random variable with a mean of zero for any fixed $t$. Therefore, $B_H(4)$ follows a normal distribution with mean $E[B_H(4)] = 0$. Its variance is given by our simplified formula:\n$$Var(B_H(4)) = 4^{2H}$$\nSo, the random variable $B_H(4)$ has the distribution $N(0, 4^{2H})$. The standard deviation is $\\sqrt{\\text{Var}(B_H(4))} = \\sqrt{4^{2H}} = (4^{2H})^{1/2} = 4^H$.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the probability $P(B_H(4)  -2)$. To do this, we standardize the random variable $B_H(4)$ by subtracting its mean and dividing by its standard deviation. Let $Z$ be a standard normal random variable, $Z \\sim N(0,1)$.\n$$P(B_H(4)  -2) = P\\left( \\frac{B_H(4) - 0}{4^H}  \\frac{-2 - 0}{4^H} \\right) = P\\left( Z  -\\frac{2}{4^H} \\right)$$\nBy the definition of the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a standard normal variable, $\\Phi(z) = P(Z  z)$, the above probability is:\n$$P(B_H(4)  -2) = \\Phi\\left(-\\frac{2}{4^H}\\right)$$\n\nThe problem states that this probability must be equal to $\\Phi(-1)$. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n$$\\Phi\\left(-\\frac{2}{4^H}\\right) = \\Phi(-1)$$\nSince the standard normal CDF, $\\Phi(z)$, is a strictly increasing function, if $\\Phi(a) = \\Phi(b)$, then it must be that $a=b$. Applying this to our equation, we get:\n$$-\\frac{2}{4^H} = -1$$\nMultiplying both sides by $-1$ gives:\n$$\\frac{2}{4^H} = 1$$\nThis implies $4^H = 2$. To solve for $H$, we can express both sides of the equation using a common base, such as 2. We know that $4 = 2^2$.\n$$(2^2)^H = 2^1$$\n$$2^{2H} = 2^1$$\nBy equating the exponents, we find:\n$$2H = 1$$\n$$H = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThe value $H=1/2$ is in the valid range $(0,1)$ for the Hurst parameter.
