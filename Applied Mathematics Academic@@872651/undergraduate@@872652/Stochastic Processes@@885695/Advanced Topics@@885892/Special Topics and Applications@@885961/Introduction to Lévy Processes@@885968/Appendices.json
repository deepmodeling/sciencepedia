A Poisson process $N(t)$ with a constant rate $\\lambda$ has the property that for any time $t > 0$, the random variable $N(t)$ follows a Poisson distribution with parameter $\\lambda t$. The mean and variance of this distribution are equal to its parameter.\nThus, for a Poisson process $N(t)$ with rate $\\lambda$:\nMean: $E[N(t)] = \\lambda t$\nVariance: $Var(N(t)) = \\lambda t$\n\nThe process $X_t$ is defined as the difference of two independent Poisson processes, $N_t^{(1)}$ and $N_t^{(2)}$, with rates $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$, respectively.\n\nFor the first process, $N_t^{(1)}$, we have:\n$E[N_t^{(1)}] = \\lambda_1 t$\n$Var(N_t^{(1)}) = \\lambda_1 t$\n\nFor the second process, $N_t^{(2)}$, we have:\n$E[N_t^{(2)}] = \\lambda_2 t$\n$Var(N_t^{(2)}) = \\lambda_2 t$\n\nNow, we can calculate the mean of $X_t$. We use the linearity of the expectation operator, which states that for any two random variables $A$ and $B$, $E[A - B] = E[A] - E[B]$.\n$$E[X_t] = E[N_t^{(1)} - N_t^{(2)}]$$\n$$E[X_t] = E[N_t^{(1)}] - E[N_t^{(2)}]$$\nSubstituting the known means of the Poisson processes:\n$$E[X_t] = \\lambda_1 t - \\lambda_2 t = (\\lambda_1 - \\lambda_2)t$$\n\nNext, we calculate the variance of $X_t$. A key property of variance is that for any two *independent* random variables $A$ and $B$, the variance of their sum or difference is the sum of their variances: $Var(A \\pm B) = Var(A) + Var(B)$. The problem statement specifies that the two Poisson processes $N_t^{(1)}$ and $N_t^{(2)}$ are independent.
