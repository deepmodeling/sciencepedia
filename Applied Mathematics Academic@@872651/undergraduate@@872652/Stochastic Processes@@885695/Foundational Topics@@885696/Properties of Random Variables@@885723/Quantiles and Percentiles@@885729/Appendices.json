{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "To begin our hands-on exploration of quantiles, we'll start with the most familiar example: the median. The median represents the 50th percentile of a dataset, providing a measure of central tendency that is often more representative than the mean, especially in the presence of skewed data or outliers. This first practice [@problem_id:1329200] walks you through the fundamental process of calculating the sample median from a discrete set of observations, a core skill in any statistical analysis.", "problem": "A network engineer is analyzing the performance of a new routing algorithm by measuring the round-trip time (latency) for a series of data packets. This sequence of measurements can be considered as a set of observations from a discrete-time stochastic process. The engineer collects six independent latency measurements, recorded in milliseconds (ms), as follows: `{12, 5, 21, 8, 15, 9}`.\n\nTo characterize the central tendency of the process while remaining robust to potential outlier measurements, the engineer decides to compute the sample median of the collected data.\n\nCalculate the sample median of this dataset. Express your answer in milliseconds.", "solution": "We are given the dataset $\\{12, 5, 21, 8, 15, 9\\}$. To compute the sample median, first sort the data in non-decreasing order:\n$$5,\\,8,\\,9,\\,12,\\,15,\\,21.$$\nFor an even sample size $n=6$, the sample median $m$ is defined as the average of the two middle order statistics $x_{n/2}$ and $x_{n/2+1}$. Therefore,\n$$m=\\frac{x_{3}+x_{4}}{2}=\\frac{9+12}{2}=\\frac{21}{2}.$$\nSince the measurements are in milliseconds, the numerical value of the median is $\\frac{21}{2}$ in milliseconds.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{21}{2}}$$", "id": "1329200"}, {"introduction": "One of the most powerful features of quantiles is their robustness to outliers and extreme values. Unlike the mean, which can be heavily skewed by a single unusual observation, the median and other quantiles provide a more stable picture of the data's distribution. In this practice [@problem_id:1949180], you will investigate this property directly by analyzing how a significant change in a single data point impacts the median and the Interquartile Range ($IQR$), offering clear insight into why these measures are so valuable for robust statistical analysis.", "problem": "A cognitive psychologist conducts a pilot study to measure the time it takes for participants to solve a complex spatial reasoning puzzle. The times recorded for the six participants are, in seconds:\n$$ \\{25, 28, 30, 34, 38, 45\\} $$\nUpon reviewing video footage, the psychologist discovers a timing error for the participant who took the longest. The recorded time of 45 seconds was incorrect; the true time was 61 seconds.\n\nFor this problem, you must use a specific method for calculating quartiles. For a dataset with $n$ observations, the $p$-th percentile is found by first calculating its rank $r = \\frac{p}{100}(n+1)$. If $r$ is an integer, the percentile is the $r$-th value in the sorted dataset, $x_r$. If $r$ is not an integer, let $r = k+d$, where $k$ is the integer part and $d$ is the fractional part. The percentile is then found by linear interpolation: $P_p = x_k + d(x_{k+1} - x_k)$. The first quartile ($Q_1$) is the 25th percentile, the median is the 50th percentile, and the third quartile ($Q_3$) is the 75th percentile. The Interquartile Range (IQR) is defined as $IQR = Q_3 - Q_1$.\n\nAfter correcting the erroneous data point, calculate the change in the sample median ($\\Delta M$) and the change in the sample Interquartile Range ($\\Delta IQR$). The change is defined as the new value minus the original value.\n\nExpress your answer as a $1 \\times 2$ row matrix containing the two numerical values $(\\Delta M, \\Delta IQR)$, in that order. The values should be in units of seconds.", "solution": "The original sorted dataset is $x_{1}=25$, $x_{2}=28$, $x_{3}=30$, $x_{4}=34$, $x_{5}=38$, $x_{6}=45$, with $n=6$.
