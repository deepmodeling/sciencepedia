Calculating the expected winnings requires first finding the expectation conditioned on the number of rounds played, $N$, and then taking the expectation over the distribution of $N$ itself.

The outcomes of the die rolls are independent of each other and of the coin flips.\n\nLet the total winnings for the gambler from all rounds be $Y$. What is the expected total winnings, $E[Y]$?\n\nExpress your answer in dollars. The final answer should be a single numerical value.", "solution": "Let $N$ be the random variable representing the number of heads obtained in 10 coin flips. Let $X_i$ be the random variable representing the payout in the $i$-th round of the second stage, for $i=1, 2, \\dots, N$. The total winnings, $Y$, can be expressed as the sum of the payouts from the $N$ rounds:\n$$Y = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i$$\nWe understand that if $N=0$, the sum is empty, and $Y=0$. We wish to compute the expected value of $Y$, which is $E[Y]$.\n\nTo solve this, we use the law of total expectation, also known as the tower property, which states that $E[Y] = E[E[Y|N]]$. We will compute this in two steps: first, the inner conditional expectation $E[Y|N]$, and second, the outer expectation.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the conditional expectation $E[Y|N]$.**\nWe condition on the event that the number of heads is a specific value, $N=n$. The total winnings are then the sum of $n$ random payouts:\n$$E[Y|N=n] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i \\bigg| N=n\\right]$$\nSince the die rolls $X_i$ are independent of the coin flips (and thus of $N$), the conditioning on $N=n$ only determines the number of terms in the sum. By the linearity of expectation, we have:\n$$E[Y|N=n] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} E[X_i]$$\nThe payout $X_i$ for each round is determined by the roll of a fair six-sided die. The possible outcomes are $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$, each with probability $\\frac{1}{6}$.

Substituting this back into the expression for the conditional expectation:\n$$E[Y|N=n] = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} 3.5 = 3.5n$$\nThis result holds for any particular value $n$ that $N$ can take. Therefore, we can express the conditional expectation as a function of the random variable $N$:\n$$E[Y|N] = 3.5N$$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the outer expectation.**\nNow we take the expectation of the result from Step 1 with respect to the distribution of $N$:\n$$E[Y] = E[E[Y|N]] = E[3.5N]$$\nUsing the linearity of expectation again, we can pull the constant out:\n$$E[Y] = 3.5 E[N]$$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the expectation of $N$.**\nThe random variable $N$ represents the number of heads in 10 flips of a biased coin. The flips are independent trials, each with a probability of success (heads) of $p=0.6$. The number of trials is $n=10$. Therefore, $N$ follows a binomial distribution, $N \\sim \\text{Bin}(n=10, p=0.6)$.\nThe expected value of a binomially distributed random variable is given by the formula $E[N] = np$.\n$$E[N] = 10 \\times 0.6 = 6$$\n\n**Step 4: Compute the final answer.**\nFinally, we substitute the value of $E[N]$ into our expression for $E[Y]$:\n$$E[Y] = 3.5 \\times E[N] = 3.5 \\times 6 = 21$$\nThe expected total winnings for the gambler are $21.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{21}$$", "id": "1346870"}, {"introduction": "The tower property is particularly powerful when applied recursively to model processes that evolve over time.
