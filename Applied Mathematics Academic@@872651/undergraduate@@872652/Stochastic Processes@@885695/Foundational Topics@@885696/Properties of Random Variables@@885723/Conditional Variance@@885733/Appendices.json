This first practice provides a clear and intuitive scenario involving a uniformly distributed random variable. By conditioning on the event that the variable falls within a specific sub-interval, we can directly calculate the new, reduced variance, illustrating the core mechanism of how conditioning sharpens our probabilistic predictions.
