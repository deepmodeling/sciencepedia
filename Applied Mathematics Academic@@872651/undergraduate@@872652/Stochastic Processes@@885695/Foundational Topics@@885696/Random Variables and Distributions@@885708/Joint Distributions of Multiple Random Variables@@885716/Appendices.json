The total number of possible outcomes is $5 \\times 5 = 25$. Due to the independence of $X$ and $Y$, the probability of any specific pair $(x, y)$ occurring is the product of their individual probabilities:\n$$P(X=x, Y=y) = P(X=x) P(Y=y) = \\frac{1}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{1}{25}$$\nEach of the 25 pairs is equally likely.\n\nWe are asked to find the probability of the joint event where the sum $S = X + Y$ is 7 and the absolute difference $D = |X - Y|$ is 3.
