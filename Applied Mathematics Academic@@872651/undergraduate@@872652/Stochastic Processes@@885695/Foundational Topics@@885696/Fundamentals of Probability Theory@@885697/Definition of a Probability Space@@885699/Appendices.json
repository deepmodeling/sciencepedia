A collection of 'distinguishable' events (which are subsets of $\\Omega$) is being constructed for data analysis. For this collection to be valid, it must satisfy three fundamental rules:\n\n1.  The 'certain event' $\\Omega$ must be in the collection.\n2.  If an event $E$ is in the collection, then the event that $E$ does not occur (its complement, $\\Omega \\setminus E$) must also be in the collection.\n3.

A collection satisfying the three rules is a field (Boolean algebra) of subsets of $\\Omega$: it contains $\\Omega$, is closed under complements (relative to $\\Omega$), and under finite unions (by induction from closure under binary unions). The smallest such collection containing $A$ and $B$ is the field generated by $A$ and $B$.\n\nFor two generating sets $A$ and $B$, the field they generate is the set of all unions of the four basic regions (atoms) determined by $A$ and $B$, namely the nonempty sets among\n$$\nA\\cap B,\\quad A\\cap B^{c},\\quad A^{c}\\cap B,\\quad A^{c}\\cap B^{c}.\n$$\nFirst compute these intersections using $B^c=\\{4,5,6\\}$ and $A^c=\\{1,3,5\\}$:\n$$\nA\\cap B=\\{2\\},\\quad A\\cap B^{c}=\\{4,6\\},\\quad A^{c}\\cap B=\\{1,3\\},\\quad A^{c}\\cap B^{c}=\\{5\\}.\n$$\nAll four regions are nonempty, so they form a partition of $\\Omega$ into $m=4$ atoms.\n\nBy De Morgan’s laws and closure properties, each atom belongs to any collection containing $A$ and $B$ that is closed under complements and unions; for example,\n$A\\cap B = (A^c\\cup B^c)^c$, $A\\cap B^c = (A^c\\cup B)^c$, $A^c\\cap B = (A\\cup B^c)^c$, $A^c\\cap B^c = (A\\cup B)^c$.\nOnce the atoms are included, closure under unions forces the collection to contain every union of these atoms. Therefore the smallest such collection has exactly $2^m$ sets, where $m$ is the number of atoms.
