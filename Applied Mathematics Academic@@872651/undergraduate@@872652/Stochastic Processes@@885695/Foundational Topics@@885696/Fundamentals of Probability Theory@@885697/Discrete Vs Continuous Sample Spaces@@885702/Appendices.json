They define several random variables associated with the breathing process of a single adult subject. For each scenario below, consider the nature of the sample space associated with the defined random variable.\n\n*   **Scenario 1:** The random variable $V_{exact}$ represents the exact, theoretical volume of air, in liters, inhaled in a single resting breath. You may assume this volume can be any real number within a physiologically possible range, from a minimum vital capacity of $V_{min}  0$ to a maximum tidal volume of $V_{max}$.\n\n*   **Scenario 2:** The random variable $N$ represents the total number of breaths a subject takes during a fixed 5-minute observation period.\n\n*   **Scenario 3:** A digital spirometer is used to measure the volume of a single breath. The device has a limited precision and records the volume in liters, rounded to the nearest 0.01 L. The random variable $V_{measured}$ represents a single reading from this device.\n\n*   **Scenario 4:** A single breath is classified based on its duration, $t$. If the duration is less than a certain threshold $T$, the outcome is labeled 'Rapid'; otherwise, it is labeled 'Slow'. The random variable $C$ represents the classification of a single breath.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describe the sample spaces of these random variables?\n\nA.

A continuous sample space contains intervals of real numbers and is uncountable.\n\nFor Scenario 1, $V_{exact}$ can take any real value in the interval $[V_{min}, V_{max}]$ with $V_{min}  0$. The sample space is $[V_{min}, V_{max}] \\subset \\mathbb{R}$, which is uncountable and therefore continuous.

In any case, it is countable and therefore discrete. Thus, statement B is false.\n\nFor Scenario 3, $V_{measured}$ is rounded to the nearest $0.01$ L, so the possible outcomes are the set $\\{k \\cdot 10^{-2} : k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$ intersected with $[V_{min}, V_{max}]$. This set is finite (hence countable) and therefore discrete.

You will learn to carefully analyze how mathematical operations on random variables transform their underlying sample spaces, a key skill in data analysis.", "problem": "A data analyst is studying student academic habits by surveying a group of $N$ randomly selected university students. The survey asks two questions:\n1.  How many full hours did you study for your most recent major exam? (Students must provide a non-negative integer.)\n2.  What was your score on that exam? (Students can report any real number from 0 to 100, inclusive.)\n\nThe analyst defines four random variables based on the collected data:\n-   V1: The number of study hours reported by a single, randomly chosen student from the group.\n-   V2: The exam score reported by a single, randomly chosen student from the group.\n-   V3: The arithmetic mean of the study hours reported by all $N$ students in the group.\n-   V4: The maximum exam score reported among all $N$ students in the group.\n\nThe task is to classify the sample space for each of these random variables.

A sample space is called discrete if it is finite or countably infinite, and continuous if it is uncountable (e.g., an interval of real numbers).\n\nFor $V1$: A single student reports a non-negative integer number of full hours.

This problem, drawn from the analysis of algorithms, presents a surprising result where two different underlying sample spaces—one discrete and one continuous—yield the exact same probability for a specific event [@problem_id:1297185]. This exercise will deepen your understanding of probabilistic equivalence and the power of abstraction in modeling.", "problem": "An essential task in computer science is sorting an array of elements. The quicksort algorithm is a popular and efficient method for this task. Consider a version of quicksort that partitions an array (or sub-array) by always selecting the rightmost element as the pivot. After selecting a pivot, it is compared with all other elements in the current sub-array to partition them into two groups: those smaller than the pivot and those larger than the pivot.\n\nWe wish to analyze the probabilistic behavior of this algorithm on a randomly generated input array of size $N=10$. We will consider two different scenarios for how the initial array is generated:\n\n**Scenario A (Discrete Sample Space):** The array is a random permutation of the set of integers $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, 10\\}$. Each of the $10!$ possible permutations is equally likely.\n\n**Scenario B (Continuous Sample Space):** The array consists of $10$ numbers drawn independently from a continuous probability distribution over the real numbers (e.g., the uniform distribution on $[0, 1]$). For such a distribution, the probability of any two drawn numbers being exactly equal is zero.\n\nLet the elements of the array in their final sorted order be denoted by $z_1  z_2  \\dots  z_{10}$. Your task is to determine the probability that the algorithm performs a comparison between the element that is 3rd smallest ($z_3$) and the element that is 8th smallest ($z_8$).\n\nBased on your analysis, which of the following statements is correct?\n\nA. The probability is $\\frac{2}{5}$ for Scenario A and $\\frac{1}{4}$ for Scenario B.\n\nB. The probability is $\\frac{1}{3}$ for both scenarios.\n\nC. The probability is $\\frac{2}{5}$ for both scenarios.\n\nD. The probability is $\\frac{1}{4}$ for both scenarios.\n\nE. The probability depends on the specific continuous distribution in Scenario B and cannot be uniquely determined.", "solution": "We analyze when two order statistics $z_{i}$ and $z_{j}$ are directly compared by quicksort that always picks the rightmost element of the current sub-array as the pivot.\n\nKey property: Two elements $z_{i}$ and $z_{j}$ are compared if and only if, among the set \n$$S=\\{z_{i},z_{i+1},\\dots,z_{j}\\},$$\nthe first pivot chosen from $S$ by the algorithm is either $z_{i}$ or $z_{j}$. The reason is:\n- If the first chosen pivot from $S$ is some $z_{k}$ with $ikj$, then $z_{i}$ and $z_{j}$ are placed into different recursive subproblems afterward and are never compared.\n- If the first chosen pivot from $S$ is $z_{i}$ (respectively $z_{j}$), then during the partition step where $z_{i}$ (respectively $z_{j}$) is the pivot, it is compared with all other elements of the current sub-array, including $z_{j}$ (respectively $z_{i}$).\n\nThus, if the first pivot selected from $S$ is equally likely to be any member of $S$, then\n$$\\Pr(\\text{$z_{i}$ and $z_{j}$ are compared})=\\frac{2}{|S|}=\\frac{2}{j-i+1}.$$\n\nIt remains to justify the symmetry that the first pivot from $S$ is uniformly distributed over $S$ in both scenarios.\n\nScenario A (random permutation of $\\{1,2,\\dots,10\\}$): The initial array is a uniformly random permutation, so the rightmost element in the full array has a rank that is uniformly distributed over the $10$ positions. After partitioning around that pivot, each recursive sub-array inherits a uniformly random relative order because the restriction of a uniformly random permutation to a subset is uniformly random over permutations of that subset. Therefore, at every recursive call, the rightmost element of the current sub-array is uniformly distributed over the elements of that sub-array. By symmetry, considering only the subset $S$, the first time the algorithm selects any element of $S$ as a pivot, that element is equally likely to be any member of $S$. Hence the probability formula above applies:\n$$\\Pr(\\text{$z_{i}$ and $z_{j}$ compared})=\\frac{2}{j-i+1}.$$\n\nScenario B (i.i.d. continuous draws): With an i.i.d. continuous distribution, ties occur with probability zero, and the induced random order of the $10$ values is uniformly random over all $10!$ permutations. Therefore the analysis of Scenario A applies verbatim: at each recursive call, the rightmost element is uniformly distributed over the current sub-array. Consequently, the same symmetry on $S$ holds, and the same probability formula applies:\n$$\\Pr(\\text{$z_{i}$ and $z_{j}$ compared})=\\frac{2}{j-i+1}.$$\n\nApplying this to $i=3$ and $j=8$ gives\n$$j-i+1=8-3+1=6,\\quad \\Pr(\\text{$z_{3}$ and $z_{8}$ compared})=\\frac{2}{6}=\\frac{1}{3}.$$\n\nTherefore, in both scenarios, the probability equals $\\frac{1}{3}$, which corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1297185"}]}
