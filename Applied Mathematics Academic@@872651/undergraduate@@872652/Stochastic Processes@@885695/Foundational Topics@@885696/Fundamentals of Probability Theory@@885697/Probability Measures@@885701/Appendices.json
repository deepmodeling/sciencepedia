Nonnegativity holds because for any $A \\subseteq \\Omega$, each term $i^{2}$ is nonnegative and the factor $\\frac{1}{14}$ is positive, hence $P(A) \\geq 0$.\n\nNext, normalization: \n$$\nP(\\Omega) = \\frac{1}{14} \\sum_{i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}} i^{2} = \\frac{1}{14} \\left(1^{2} + 2^{2} + 3^{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{14} \\cdot 14 = 1.\n$$\nThus $P(\\Omega) = 1$.\n\nFinally, countable additivity for disjoint events holds. Let $\\{A_{k}\\}_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ be pairwise disjoint subsets of $\\Omega$. Since $\\Omega$ is finite, at most finitely many $A_{k}$ are nonempty, so the sums below are finite and may be rearranged:\n$$\nP\\left(\\bigcup_{k} A_{k}\\right) = \\frac{1}{14} \\sum_{i \\in \\cup_{k} A_{k}} i^{2} = \\frac{1}{14} \\sum_{k} \\sum_{i \\in A_{k}} i^{2} = \\sum_{k} \\left(\\frac{1}{14} \\sum_{i \\in A_{k}} i^{2}\\right) = \\sum_{k} P(A_{k}).\n$$\nTherefore, $P$ satisfies $P(\\emptyset)=0$, nonnegativity, normalization, and countable additivity, so it is a valid probability measure.
