The memory cell can be in one of two states: a 'stable' state (State 0), where it correctly stores a bit of information, or a 'corrupted' state (State 1), where the information is lost due to a stochastic quantum event.\n\nBased on their theoretical model, the transition from the stable state to the corrupted state occurs with a constant rate $\\lambda > 0$. Once a cell enters the corrupted state, it is permanently damaged and cannot return to the stable state. The process starts at time $t=0$ with the cell in the stable state.\n\nAssuming this model is accurate, derive a mathematical expression for the reliability of the memory cell at time $t$. The reliability is defined as the probability that the cell is still in the stable state (State 0) at a given time $t > 0$.
