A fundamental question in this context is: how long must we wait for a certain number of successes to occur? This exercise, [@problem_id:1309338], introduces the negative binomial distribution, which provides the answer to this question. By calculating the probability that the second 'high-priority' event happens at a specific trial, you will practice the core logic behind modeling waiting times in discrete-time stochastic processes.", "problem": "A server at a large-scale data center processes a continuous stream of user requests. Most requests are standard, but a small fraction are \"high-priority\" requests that require special handling. Each incoming request is independently classified as high-priority with a constant probability $p$, where $0  p  1$.\n\nAn engineer begins monitoring the stream of requests. Determine the probability that the second high-priority request the engineer observes is precisely the tenth request to arrive at the server since monitoring began.
