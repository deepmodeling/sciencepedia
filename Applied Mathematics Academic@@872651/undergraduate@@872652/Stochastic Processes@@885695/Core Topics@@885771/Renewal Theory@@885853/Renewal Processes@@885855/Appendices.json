This agent has a finite operational lifetime and must be replaced immediately upon failure. The sequence of these replacements forms a renewal process. The lifetime of any given software agent, measured in discrete time units of days, is a random variable. An agent can fail at the end of its first day of operation with probability $p=0.5$, or it can fail at the end of its second day of operation with probability $1-p=0.5$. The lifetimes of successive agents are independent and identically distributed. A new agent is installed at the beginning of day 1 (time $t=0$).
