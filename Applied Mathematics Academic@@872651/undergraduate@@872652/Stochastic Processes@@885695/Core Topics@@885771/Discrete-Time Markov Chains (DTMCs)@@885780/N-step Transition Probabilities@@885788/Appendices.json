The condition of the bridge evolves from year to year as a stochastic process. Based on historical data, a model for these yearly transitions has been developed. A section's condition can either stay the same, improve, or degrade. However, large changes in a single year are highly improbable. Specifically, a section rated 'Excellent' will not degrade to 'Fair' or 'Poor' in a single year, and a section rated 'Good' will not degrade to 'Poor' in a single year. Similarly, improvements are gradual: a 'Poor' section cannot become 'Good' or 'Excellent' in one year, and a 'Fair' section cannot become 'Excellent' in one year.\n\nThe one-step transition probabilities are given by the matrix $P$ where the states are ordered (E, G, F, P):\n$$\nP = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0.70 & 0.30 & 0.00 & 0.00 \\\\\n0.10 & 0.70 & 0.20 & 0.00 \\\\\n0.00 & 0.15 & 0.60 & 0.25 \\\\\n0.00 & 0.00 & 0.10 & 0.90\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe entry $P_{ij}$ represents the probability of transitioning from state $i$ to state $j$ in one year.
