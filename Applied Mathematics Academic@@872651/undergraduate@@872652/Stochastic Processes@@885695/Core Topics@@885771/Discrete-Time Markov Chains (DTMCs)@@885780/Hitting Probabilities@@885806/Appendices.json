The swarm's collective resource state is evaluated once every hour and can be classified into one of three distinct states: 'Abundant', 'Stable', or 'Depleted'. The state transitions are governed by a discrete-time Markov process. Based on extensive simulations, the following one-step transition probabilities have been established for a swarm starting in the 'Stable' state:\n\n- The probability of transitioning from 'Stable' to 'Abundant' in the next hour is 0.3.\n- The probability of remaining in the 'Stable' state in the next hour is 0.5.\n- The probability of transitioning from 'Stable' to 'Depleted' in the next hour is 0.2.\n\nThe 'Abundant' state represents mission success, and the 'Depleted' state represents mission failure. Once the swarm enters either the 'Abundant' or 'Depleted' state, its mission is considered complete, and it remains in that state.\n\nAssuming the swarm starts in the 'Stable' state, what is the probability that it will reach the 'Abundant' state before it reaches the 'Depleted' state?
