The states represent the following modes:\n- State 1: `Standby`\n- State 2: `Surveying Area`\n- State 3: `Returning to Base`\n- State 4: `Landing Sequence`\n- State 5: `Safe Shutdown`\n\nFrom any given state, the drone can only transition to a specific set of subsequent states. These allowed one-step transitions are as follows:\n- From `Standby` (1), it can only transition to `Surveying Area` (2).\n- From `Surveying Area` (2), it can only transition to `Standby` (1).\n- From `Returning to Base` (3), it can only transition to `Landing Sequence` (4).\n- From `Landing Sequence` (4), it can only transition to `Safe Shutdown` (5).\n- From `Safe Shutdown` (5), it remains in `Safe Shutdown` (5).\n\nThere are no other possible one-step transitions.

A state is recurrent if the process, starting from that state, is certain to return to it. Otherwise, it is transient. This problem [@problem_id:1288866] uses a simple arcade game to illustrate a critical link between communication and recurrence: for a state to be recurrent, its communicating class must be closed. You will discover that if there is an \"escape route\" from a class, all states within it are transient.", "problem": "A simple arcade game involves a player navigating through four levels, labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. The player's journey is modeled as a discrete-time Markov chain on the state space $S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, where the state represents the player's current level. The transition probabilities between levels are given as follows:\n- From level 1, the player has a probability $p_{11} > 0$ of replaying the level and a probability $p_{12} > 0$ of advancing to level 2, with $p_{11} + p_{12} = 1$.\n- From level 2, the player has a probability $p_{21} > 0$ of being sent back to level 1 and a probability $p_{23} > 0$ of advancing to level 3, with $p_{21} + p_{23} = 1$.\n- From level 3, the player has a probability $p_{32} > 0$ of being sent back to level 2 and a probability $p_{34} > 0$ of advancing to level 4, with $p_{32} + p_{34} = 1$.\n- Level 4 is the final 'Game Over' level.

By assumption, level $4$ is absorbing, so $p_{44}=1$ and $p_{4j}=0$ for all $j \\neq 4$. A state $i$ is recurrent if, when starting from $i$, the probability of ever returning to $i$ equals $1$; it is transient if that probability is strictly less than $1$. In a finite Markov chain, recurrent states necessarily belong to closed communicating classes; moreover, every non-closed communicating class consists entirely of transient states.\n\nFirst, we establish the communication relations among levels $1,2,3$:\n- From level $1$, $p_{12}0$, so $1 \\to 2$.\n- From level $2$, $p_{21}0$ and $p_{23}0$, so $2 \\to 1$ and $2 \\to 3$.\n- From level $3$, $p_{32}0$ and $p_{34}0$, so $3 \\to 2$ and $3 \\to 4$.\n\nThus, within $\\{1,2,3\\}$ we have $1 \\leftrightarrow 2$ (since $1 \\to 2$ and $2 \\to 1$) and $2 \\leftrightarrow 3$ (since $2 \\to 3$ and $3 \\to 2$), hence $1,2,3$ all communicate with each other; i.e., $\\{1,2,3\\}$ is a single communicating class. However, this class is not closed because from state $3$ there is a positive probability $p_{34}0$ to move to state $4 \\notin \\{1,2,3\\}$. Therefore, by the finite-state classification theorem, every state in the non-closed communicating class $\\{1,2,3\\}$ is transient.\n\nEquivalently, since the only closed class is $\\{4\\}$ and it is absorbing, and since from any $i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$ there exists a path to $4$ with positive probability (e.g., $1 \\to 2 \\to 3 \\to 4$ with product probability $p_{12} p_{23} p_{34} > 0$), absorption at $4$ occurs with probability $1$ starting from any of $1,2,3$. Hence the probability of returning infinitely often to any of $1,2,3$ is zero, which confirms that $1,2,3$ are transient.\n\nTherefore, all three states $1,2,3$ are transient, corresponding to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1288866"}, {"introduction": "Periodicity describes the temporal pattern of a Markov chain's movement.
