This first exercise [@problem_id:1280486] presents a classic, symmetrical scenario of a rumor spreading in a circle. By mapping out the possible paths the rumor can take, we can directly investigate the concepts of accessibility and communication, and discover the defining characteristic of an irreducible system where all states belong to a single communicating class.", "problem": "Four individuals, labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4, are arranged in a circular formation. The arrangement is such that person 1 is neighbors with persons 2 and 4; person 2 is neighbors with persons 1 and 3; person 3 is neighbors with persons 2 and 4; and person 4 is neighbors with persons 3 and 1.\n\nA rumor is being passed among these four people. The process is modeled as a discrete-time Markov chain where the state of the system at any time step is the label of the person who currently possesses the rumor. At each time step, the person holding the rumor passes it to one of their two immediate neighbors, chosen with equal probability. The person who passes the rumor no longer has it.\n\nWe define state relationships as follows:\n- State $j$ is **accessible** from state $i$ if it is possible to transition from state $i$ to state $j$ in a finite number of steps with a non-zero probability.\n- Two states $i$ and $j$ **communicate** if state $j$ is accessible from state $i$ AND state $i$ is accessible from state $j$.\n- A **communication class** is a set of states where every pair of states in the set communicates with each other, and no state in the set communicates with any state outside the set.\n\nBased on this model, which of the following statements is true?\n\nA. State 3 is accessible from state 1, but state 1 is not accessible from state 3.\n\nB. The system is reducible, with two distinct communication classes: {1, 3} and {2, 4}.\n\nC. State 4 is not accessible from state 2.\n\nD. All states in the system belong to a single communication class.\n\nE. The system has three or more distinct communication classes.", "solution": "Let the state space of the Markov chain be $S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, where the state represents the person who has the rumor. We need to analyze the accessibility and communication between these states.\n\nFirst, let's establish the one-step transition probabilities. At each step, a person passes the rumor to one of their two neighbors with probability $1/2$.\n- From state 1, the system can transition to state 2 or state 4. So, $P(X_{n+1}=2 | X_n=1) = 1/2$ and $P(X_{n+1}=4 | X_n=1) = 1/2$.\n- From state 2, the system can transition to state 1 or state 3. So, $P(X_{n+1}=1 | X_n=2) = 1/2$ and $P(X_{n+1}=3 | X_n=2) = 1/2$.\n- From state 3, the system can transition to state 2 or state 4. So, $P(X_{n+1}=2 | X_n=3) = 1/2$ and $P(X_{n+1}=4 | X_n=3) = 1/2$.\n- From state 4, the system can transition to state 3 or state 1. So, $P(X_{n+1}=3 | X_n=4) = 1/2$ and $P(X_{n+1}=1 | X_n=4) = 1/2$.\nAll other one-step transition probabilities are zero.\n\nNow, we evaluate the accessibility and communication between all pairs of states. Two states $i$ and $j$ communicate, denoted $i \\leftrightarrow j$, if $i$ is accessible from $j$ ($j \\to i$) and $j$ is accessible from $i$ ($i \\to j$).\n\nLet's check communication for neighboring states first.\n- $1 \\to 2$ is possible in one step with probability $1/2$.\n- $2 \\to 1$ is possible in one step with probability $1/2$.\nSince both are accessible from each other, states 1 and 2 communicate: $1 \\leftrightarrow 2$.\nBy the same logic for all adjacent pairs in the circle:\n- $2 \\leftrightarrow 3$ (since $2 \\to 3$ and $3 \\to 2$ are one-step transitions).\n- $3 \\leftrightarrow 4$ (since $3 \\to 4$ and $4 \\to 3$ are one-step transitions).\n- $4 \\leftrightarrow 1$ (since $4 \\to 1$ and $1 \\to 4$ are one-step transitions).\n\nThe communication relation is an equivalence relation. This means it is reflexive ($i \\leftrightarrow i$), symmetric (if $i \\leftrightarrow j$, then $j \\leftrightarrow i$), and transitive (if $i \\leftrightarrow j$ and $j \\leftrightarrow k$, then $i \\leftrightarrow k$).\nUsing transitivity:\n- We have $1 \\leftrightarrow 2$ and $2 \\leftrightarrow 3$. Therefore, $1 \\leftrightarrow 3$.\n- We have $1 \\leftrightarrow 3$ and $3 \\leftrightarrow 4$. Therefore, $1 \\leftrightarrow 4$.\n\nSince state 1 communicates with states 2, 3, and 4, it follows that all states communicate with each other. For example, since $1 \\leftrightarrow 2$ and $1 \\leftrightarrow 3$, by symmetry and transitivity, we have $2 \\leftrightarrow 1$ and $1 \\leftrightarrow 3$, which implies $2 \\leftrightarrow 3$. We have already established this directly, but this confirms the structure.\n\nBecause every state in the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ communicates with every other state in the set, they all belong to a single communication class. A Markov chain with only one communication class is called irreducible.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\nA. State 3 is accessible from state 1, but state 1 is not accessible from state 3. This is false. We showed $1 \\leftrightarrow 3$. Accessibility is in both directions. For example, a path from 1 to 3 is $1 \\to 2 \\to 3$, which has a non-zero probability of $(1/2) \\times (1/2) = 1/4$. A path from 3 to 1 is $3 \\to 2 \\to 1$, which has a probability of $(1/2) \\times (1/2) = 1/4$.\n\nB. The system is reducible, with two distinct communication classes: {1, 3} and {2, 4}. This is false. A transition is possible from state 1 (in {1, 3}) to state 2 (in {2, 4}) in one step. If they were separate communication classes, no such transition would be possible.\n\nC. State 4 is not accessible from state 2. This is false. A possible path from 2 to 4 is $2 \\to 1 \\to 4$. The probability of this two-step transition is $(1/2) \\times (1/2) = 1/4$, which is non-zero. Thus, state 4 is accessible from state 2.\n\nD. All states in the system belong to a single communication class. This is true. As demonstrated above, every state communicates with every other state in the system.\n\nE. The system has three or more distinct communication classes. This is false. Since there are only 4 states, and we've shown they all form one class, this is impossible.\n\nTherefore, the only correct statement is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1280486"}, {"introduction": "Not all systems allow for movement between any two states; some contain 'one-way streets.'
