This loop is held stationary, centered at the origin within the $xy$-plane of an inertial reference frame described by spacetime coordinates $(x^\\mu) = (ct, x, y, z)$. A steady, time-independent current of magnitude $I$ flows through the wire. When viewed from the positive $z$-axis, the current flows in the counter-clockwise direction.

The four-divergence in Minkowski spacetime is $\\partial_\\mu J^\\mu = \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\vec{J}$.\n\nFirst, let's determine the components of $J^\\mu$.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the charge density component $J^0$.**\nThe problem states that the system is electrically neutral. This means that for any point in space, the net electric charge density $\\rho$ is zero. Although there are moving charges constituting the current $I$, there is an equal and opposite density of stationary charges (the positive ions of the conductor) that makes the wire neutral.\nTherefore, $\\rho(x, y, z, t) = 0$ for all spacetime points.\nThe time-like component of the four-current is $J^0 = \\rho c$. Since $\\rho=0$, we have $J^0=0$.\nConsequently, the time-derivative term in the four-divergence is also zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial J^0}{\\partial x^0} = \\frac{\\partial J^0}{c \\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial (0)}{c \\partial t} = 0\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Determine the 3-current density vector $\\vec{J}$.**\nThe problem now reduces to calculating the 3-divergence, $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{J}$. To do this, we must first find a mathematical expression for $\\vec{J}$. The geometry of the problem is cylindrical, so it is most convenient to work in cylindrical coordinates $(\\rho', \\phi, z)$, where $\\rho'$ is the radial distance in the $xy$-plane to avoid confusion with the charge density $\\rho$.\n\nThe current is confined to a circle of radius $R$ in the $z=0$ plane. This localization can be expressed using Dirac delta functions. The current exists only at $\\rho' = R$ and $z=0$.\nThe current flows in the counter-clockwise direction, which corresponds to the tangential unit vector $\\hat{\\phi}$ in cylindrical coordinates.\nTherefore, the current density vector $\\vec{J}$ can be written as:\n$$\n\\vec{J}(\\rho', \\phi, z) = J_{\\rho'} \\hat{\\rho'} + J_{\\phi} \\hat{\\phi} + J_z \\hat{z}\n$$\nFrom the problem description:\n- The current has no radial component: $J_{\\rho'} = 0$.\n- The current has no vertical component: $J_z = 0$.\n- The current has only a tangential component, $J_\\phi$, which is non-zero only on the specified loop.\n\nWe can express $J_{\\phi}$ as $J_{\\phi} = C \\delta(\\rho' - R)\\delta(z)$ for some constant $C$. To find the value of $C$, we relate it to the total current $I$. The total current $I$ is the flux of the current density $\\vec{J}$ through a surface that the current loop pierces. Let's consider a surface in the $\\rho'z$-plane at a constant angle $\\phi$, which is a half-plane extending from the $z$-axis. The current $I$ flows through this surface.\nThe differential surface element is $d\\vec{S} = d\\rho' dz \\, \\hat{\\phi}$.\n$$\nI = \\int_S \\vec{J} \\cdot d\\vec{S} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dz \\int_{0}^{\\infty} d\\rho' J_{\\phi}\n$$\nSubstituting our expression for $J_{\\phi}$:\n$$\nI = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dz \\int_{0}^{\\infty} d\\rho' \\, C \\delta(\\rho' - R)\\delta(z)\n$$\nUsing the sifting property of the Dirac delta function, $\\int f(x) \\delta(x-a) dx = f(a)$, we evaluate the integrals:\n$$\nI = C \\left( \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\delta(z) dz \\right) \\left( \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\delta(\\rho' - R) d\\rho' \\right) = C \\cdot (1) \\cdot (1) = C\n$$\nThus, the constant $C=I$. The 3-current density in cylindrical coordinates is:\n$$\n\\vec{J}(\\rho', \\phi, z) = I \\delta(\\rho' - R)\\delta(z) \\hat{\\phi}\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the 3-divergence $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{J}$.**\nThe divergence operator in cylindrical coordinates is given by:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{A} = \\frac{1}{\\rho'} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\rho'} (\\rho' A_{\\rho'}) + \\frac{1}{\\rho'} \\frac{\\partial A_\\phi}{\\partial \\phi} + \\frac{\\partial A_z}{\\partial z}\n$$\nWe apply this formula to our current density $\\vec{J}$, for which the components are $J_{\\rho'}=0$, $J_{\\phi}=I\\delta(\\rho'-R)\\delta(z)$, and $J_z=0$.\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{J} = \\frac{1}{\\rho'} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\rho'} (\\rho' \\cdot 0) + \\frac{1}{\\rho'} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi} \\left( I\\delta(\\rho'-R)\\delta(z) \\right) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} (0)\n$$\nLet's analyze each term:\n- The first term is $\\frac{1}{\\rho'} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\rho'}(0) = 0$.\n- The third term is $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}(0) = 0$.\n- For the second term, we need to take the partial derivative of $J_\\phi$ with respect to $\\phi$. The expression for $J_\\phi$, which is $I\\delta(\\rho'-R)\\delta(z)$, does not have any dependence on the angle $\\phi$. Therefore, its derivative with respect to $\\phi$ is zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi} \\left( I\\delta(\\rho'-R)\\delta(z) \\right) = 0\n$$\nThis means the second term is also zero.\nSo, we find that $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{J} = 0$. This result reflects the fact that there are no sources or sinks of current along the loop, which is a property of a steady current.\n\n**Step 4: Combine the results to find the four-divergence.**\nThe four-divergence is $\\partial_\\mu J^\\mu = \\frac{\\partial J^0}{\\partial x^0} + \\nabla \\cdot \\vec{J}$.\nFrom Step 1, we found $\\frac{\\partial J^0}{\\partial x^0} = 0$.\nFrom Step 3, we found $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{J} = 0$.\nTherefore,\n$$\n\\partial_\\mu J^\\mu = 0 + 0 = 0\n$$\nThe value of the four-divergence is 0, which confirms that the continuity equation is satisfied for this steady, neutral current distribution.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "1489879"}, {"introduction": "Electromagnetic fields are not static backdrops; they are dynamic entities that carry energy, momentum, and angular momentum.
