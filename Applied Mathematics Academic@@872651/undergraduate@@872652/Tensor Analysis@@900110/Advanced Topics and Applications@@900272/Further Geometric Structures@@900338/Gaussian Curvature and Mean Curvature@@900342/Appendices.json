This final practice encourages you to think conceptually about the interplay between these two fundamental measures and to connect abstract conditions to concrete geometric examples [@problem_id:1659374].", "problem": "In the differential geometry of surfaces in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, the local geometry of a regular surface patch is characterized by its principal curvatures, denoted $k_1$ and $k_2$. Two important geometric invariants are derived from these curvatures: the Gaussian curvature $K$ and the mean curvature $H$. The Gaussian curvature, given by $K = k_1 k_2$, is an intrinsic property, meaning it can be determined purely by measurements within the surface. A surface is said to be intrinsically flat if its Gaussian curvature is zero everywhere. The mean curvature, given by $H = \\frac{1}{2}(k_1 + k_2)$, is an extrinsic property, depending on how the surface is embedded in the surrounding space.\n\nConsider the following question: Can a regular surface patch in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ be simultaneously intrinsically flat (i.e., have $K=0$ everywhere) and possess a non-zero constant mean curvature (i.e., $H=H_0$ for some non-zero constant $H_0$)?\n\nAnalyze the relationship between the principal curvatures under these two conditions and determine which of the following statements is correct.\n\nA. Yes, a right circular cylinder provides a valid example.\n\nB. Yes, a right circular cone (excluding the apex) provides a valid example.\n\nC. No, because intrinsic flatness ($K=0$) implies that both principal curvatures must be zero, which in turn forces the mean curvature $H$ to be zero.\n\nD. No, because intrinsic flatness implies the surface can be locally mapped to a plane without distortion (i.e., is developable), and any planar patch has zero mean curvature.\n\nE. No, the two conditions are mathematically contradictory, as one principal curvature would have to be zero while the other is non-zero, which is impossible for a smooth surface.", "solution": "Let $k_{1}$ and $k_{2}$ be the principal curvatures. The hypotheses are\n$$\nK=k_{1}k_{2}=0 \\quad \\text{everywhere}, \\qquad H=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(k_{1}+k_{2}\\right)=H_{0} \\quad \\text{with } H_{0}\\neq 0 \\text{ constant}.\n$$\nFrom $k_{1}k_{2}=0$, at each point at least one of $k_{1},k_{2}$ is zero. Because $k_{1}+k_{2}=2H_{0}\\neq 0$, they cannot both be zero. Hence at each point exactly one principal curvature is zero and the other equals $2H_{0}$. There are two algebraic possibilities:\n$$\nk_{1}=0,\\quad k_{2}=2H_{0} \\qquad \\text{or} \\qquad k_{2}=0,\\quad k_{1}=2H_{0}.\n$$\nBy continuity of principal curvatures on a connected patch and the fact that $H_{0}\\neq 0$ (so there is no point with $k_{1}=k_{2}=0$), which principal curvature vanishes cannot switch across the patch. Therefore, on a connected regular patch, one principal curvature vanishes identically and the other equals the nonzero constant $2H_{0}$. Geometrically, this means the surface is developable (one family of principal directions has zero normal curvature), and the nonzero principal curvature is constant.\n\nAn explicit example satisfying these conditions is a right circular cylinder of radius $R$. For such a cylinder,\n$$\nk_{1}=0,\\qquad k_{2}=\\frac{1}{R},\\qquad K=0,\\qquad H=\\frac{1}{2}\\left(0+\\frac{1}{R}\\right)=\\frac{1}{2R},\n$$\nso $H$ is constant and nonzero. This establishes that such surfaces do exist, validating statement A.\n\nNow we evaluate the remaining options:\n\nB. For a right circular cone (excluding the apex), $K=0$ since it is developable, but $H$ is not constant and cannot be a nonzero constant. A scaling argument shows this: set the apex at the origin. For any dilation by factor $\\lambda>0$, the cone is mapped to itself, while principal curvatures, and hence $H$, scale by $\\lambda^{-1}$. If $H\\equiv H_{0}\\neq 0$ were constant, invariance of the cone under all dilations would force $H_{0}=H_{0}/\\lambda$ for all $\\lambda$, implying $H_{0}=0$, a contradiction. Thus B is false.\n\nC. The claim that $K=0$ forces $k_{1}=k_{2}=0$ is false. The condition $K=0$ only implies $k_{1}k_{2}=0$, allowing one principal curvature to be zero and the other nonzero (as on a cylinder). Hence C is false.\n\nD. Intrinsic flatness implies the surface is locally isometric to the plane (developable), but it need not be a planar patch. The cylinder is locally isometric to the plane and has $H=\\frac{1}{2R}\\neq 0$. Hence D is false.\n\nE. It is not impossible for a smooth surface to have one principal curvature zero and the other nonzero; the cylinder is a smooth counterexample. Hence E is false.\n\nTherefore, the only correct statement is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1659374"}]}
