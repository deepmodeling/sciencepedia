In its initial, undeformed state, any point within the body is identified by its material coordinates $(X_1, X_2, X_3)$ with respect to a fixed Cartesian coordinate system. After the deformation, the same material point moves to a new spatial position described by coordinates $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ in the same Cartesian system.\n\nThe deformation is a pure stretch, meaning it acts uniformly throughout the body and along the principal coordinate axes without any rotation. Specifically, a material line element that is initially aligned with the $X_1$-axis is stretched by a constant factor $\\lambda_1$. Similarly, material line elements initially aligned with the $X_2$ and $X_3$ axes are stretched by constant factors $\\lambda_2$ and $\\lambda_3$, respectively.
