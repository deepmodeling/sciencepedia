We can verify that this is a unit-speed curve: $|\\gamma'(t)|^2 = \\cos^2 t + (-\\sin t)^2 = 1$.\n\nThe Jacobi equation is $\\nabla_t \\nabla_t J(t) + R(J(t), \\gamma'(t))\\gamma'(t) = 0$.\nThe problem provides the formula for the curvature term on $S^2$:\n$R(J, \\gamma')\\gamma' = \\langle \\gamma', \\gamma' \\rangle J - \\langle J, \\gamma' \\rangle \\gamma'$.\n\nWe are given two conditions for the Jacobi field $J(t)$:\n1.  $J(t)$ is orthogonal to $\\gamma'(t)$, which means $\\langle J(t), \\gamma'(t) \\rangle = 0$ for all $t$.\n2.  $J(t)$ vanishes at $t=0$, so $J(0) = \\mathbf{0}$.\n\nLet's use the first condition to simplify the curvature term.

Since $J(t)$ must be orthogonal to $\\gamma'(t)$, we need to find a vector field $E(t)$ that is also tangent to the sphere at $\\gamma(t)$ and orthogonal to $\\gamma'(t)$, so that $\\{E(t)\\}$ forms a basis for the one-dimensional space of vectors orthogonal to $\\gamma'(t)$ in the tangent plane $T_{\\gamma(t)}S^2$.\n\nLet's look for a simple vector field $E(t)$ that satisfies these properties. The tangent space $T_{\\gamma(t)}S^2$ is the plane orthogonal to the position vector $\\gamma(t)$. So, any vector $V$ in $T_{\\gamma(t)}S^2$ must satisfy $\\langle V, \\gamma(t) \\rangle = 0$.\nLet's try the constant vector field $E_0 = (0, 1, 0)$.\nFirst, let's check if it's tangent to the sphere along $\\gamma(t)$:\n$\\langle E_0, \\gamma(t) \\rangle = \\langle (0, 1, 0), (\\sin t, 0, \\cos t) \\rangle = 0$.

Yes, it is.\nFinally, let's make it a unit vector field. $|E_0| = 1$.\nSo, we can choose our basis vector field to be $E(t) = (0, 1, 0)$.\n\nA crucial property of this basis field $E(t)$ is that it is parallel-transported along $\\gamma(t)$. The covariant derivative $\\nabla_t E(t)$ is the projection of the ordinary derivative $E'(t)$ onto the tangent plane $T_{\\gamma(t)}S^2$. Since $E(t)=(0,1,0)$ is a constant vector, its ordinary derivative is $E'(t) = \\mathbf{0}$. The projection of the zero vector is the zero vector, so $\\nabla_t E(t) = \\mathbf{0}$.\n\nNow we can write the Jacobi field $J(t)$ in terms of this basis. Since $J(t)$ is in the tangent space and orthogonal to $\\gamma'(t)$, it must be proportional to $E(t)$:\n$J(t) = f(t) E(t)$, for some scalar function $f(t)$.\n\nLet's compute the covariant derivatives of $J(t)$:\n$\\nabla_t J(t) = \\nabla_t (f(t) E(t)) = f'(t) E(t) + f(t) \\nabla_t E(t)$.\nSince $\\nabla_t E(t) = \\mathbf{0}$, this simplifies to $\\nabla_t J(t) = f'(t) E(t)$.\n\nNow for the second covariant derivative:\n$\\nabla_t \\nabla_t J(t) = \\nabla_t (f'(t) E(t)) = f''(t) E(t) + f'(t) \\nabla_t E(t)$.\nAgain, using $\\nabla_t E(t) = \\mathbf{0}$, we get $\\nabla_t \\nabla_t J(t) = f''(t) E(t)$.\n\nSubstitute this into our simplified Jacobi equation $\\nabla_t \\nabla_t J(t) + J(t) = 0$:\n$f''(t) E(t) + f(t) E(t) = 0$\n$(f''(t) + f(t)) E(t) = 0$.\nSince $E(t)$ is a non-zero vector field, the scalar function must be zero:\n$f''(t) + f(t) = 0$.\n\nThis is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator. Its general solution is:\n$f(t) = C_1 \\cos(t) + C_2 \\sin(t)$, where $C_1$ and $C_2$ are arbitrary constants.\n\nNow we apply the second condition, $J(0) = \\mathbf{0}$.\n$J(0) = f(0) E(0) = (C_1 \\cos(0) + C_2 \\sin(0)) E(0) = (C_1 \\cdot 1 + C_2 \\cdot 0) E(0) = C_1 E(0)$.\nSince $E(0) = (0,1,0)$ is not the zero vector, for $J(0)$ to be the zero vector, we must have $C_1 = 0$.\n\nSo, the function $f(t)$ must be of the form $f(t) = C_2 \\sin(t)$.\nThe general form of the Jacobi field $J(t)$ satisfying the given conditions is therefore:\n$J(t) = f(t) E(t) = C_2 \\sin(t) (0, 1, 0) = (0, C_2 \\sin(t), 0)$.\n\nThe problem asks to denote the arbitrary constant by $C$.

In the given coordinates, this is $\\gamma(t) = (t, \\theta_0)$ for some constant $\\theta_0$. The tangent vector is $\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = \\partial_t$. Since $g(\\partial_t, \\partial_t) = g_{11}=1$, this is indeed a unit-speed curve (and it can be verified to be a geodesic).\n\nFor a two-dimensional manifold, the Riemann curvature term simplifies considerably:\n$$\nR(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = K \\left( g(\\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma})J - g(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} \\right)\n$$\nGiven that $\\gamma$ is unit-speed, $g(\\dot{\\gamma}, \\dot{\\gamma}) = 1$. The problem specifies that $J(t)$ arises from an orthogonal variation, which means $J(t)$ is everywhere orthogonal to $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$, i.e., $g(J, \\dot{\\gamma}) = 0$.\nThe curvature term thus reduces to $R(J, \\dot{\\gamma})\\dot{\\gamma} = K \\cdot J$.\nThe Jacobi equation simplifies to:\n$$\nD_t D_t J + K(t) J = 0\n$$\nThe Jacobi field $J$ is normal to $\\dot{\\gamma}=\\partial_t$, so it must be proportional to $\\partial_\\theta$. We define the unit normal vector field $N(t)$ along $\\gamma(t)$ as:\n$$\nN(t) = \\frac{1}{\\|\\partial_\\theta\\|} \\partial_\\theta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{g(\\partial_\\theta, \\partial_\\theta)}} \\partial_\\theta = \\frac{1}{f(t)} \\partial_\\theta\n$$\nThe Jacobi field $J(t)$ can be expressed as $J(t) = j(t)N(t)$, where $j(t)$ is the scalar normal component we need to find the equation for.\n\nTo proceed, we compute the covariant derivatives of $J(t)$. First, we show that the unit normal field $N(t)$ is parallel-transported along the meridian $\\gamma(t)$, i.e., $D_t N = \\nabla_{\\partial_t} N = 0$.\n$$\nD_t N = \\nabla_{\\partial_t} \\left(\\frac{1}{f(t)}\\partial_\\theta\\right) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{1}{f(t)}\\right)\\partial_\\theta + \\frac{1}{f(t)} \\nabla_{\\partial_t} \\partial_\\theta\n$$\nThe Christoffel symbol needed is $\\Gamma^k_{12}$, for $\\nabla_{\\partial_t} \\partial_\\theta = \\Gamma^k_{12}\\partial_k$. We find $\\Gamma^1_{12}=0$ and $\\Gamma^2_{12} = \\frac{f'(t)}{f(t)}$.\nThus, $\\nabla_{\\partial_t} \\partial_\\theta = \\frac{f'(t)}{f(t)}\\partial_\\theta$.\nSubstituting this back, along with $\\frac{d}{dt}(\\frac{1}{f}) = -\\frac{f'(t)}{f(t)^2}$:\n$$\nD_t N = -\\frac{f'(t)}{f(t)^2} \\partial_\\theta + \\frac{1}{f(t)} \\left(\\frac{f'(t)}{f(t)} \\partial_\\theta\\right) = \\left(-\\frac{f'(t)}{f(t)^2} + \\frac{f'(t)}{f(t)^2}\\right) \\partial_\\theta = 0\n$$\nSince $N(t)$ is parallel-transported, the covariant derivatives of $J(t)=j(t)N(t)$ simplify greatly:\n$$\nD_t J = D_t(jN) = \\frac{dj}{dt}N + j(D_t N) = j'(t)N(t)\n$$\n$$\nD_t D_t J = D_t(j'N) = \\frac{dj'}{dt}N + j'(D_t N) = j''(t)N(t)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the simplified Jacobi equation $D_t D_t J + K J = 0$:\n$$\nj''(t)N(t) + K(t)j(t)N(t) = 0 \\implies \\left(j''(t) + K(t)j(t)\\right)N(t) = 0\n$$\nAs $N(t)$ is a non-zero vector field, the scalar part must be zero. This yields the final scalar ordinary differential equation for $j(t)$:\n$$\nj''(t) + K(t)j(t) = 0\n$$\n\n### Solution of Test Cases\nThe problem is now reduced to solving the initial value problem $j''(t) + K(t)j(t) = 0$ with $j(0)=0$ and $j'(0)=1$.\n\n#### Case A (Constant Positive Curvature)\n- $f(t)=\\sin t$.\n- $f'(t)=\\cos t$, $f''(t)=-\\sin t$.\n- $K(t) = -f''(t)/f(t) = -(-\\sin t)/\\sin t = 1$.\n- The ODE is $j''(t) + j(t) = 0$.\n- The general solution is $j(t) = C_1 \\cos t + C_2 \\sin t$.\n- Applying initial conditions:\n  - $j(0)=0 \\implies C_1 \\cos 0 + C_2 \\sin 0 = C_1 = 0$.\n  - $j'(t) = C_2 \\cos t$.
