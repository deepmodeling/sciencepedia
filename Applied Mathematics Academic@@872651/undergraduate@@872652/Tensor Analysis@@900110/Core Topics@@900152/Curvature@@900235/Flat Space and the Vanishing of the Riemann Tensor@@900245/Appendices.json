A crucial first step in understanding this is to recognize that the appearance of a metric tensor can be deceiving. This first exercise provides a concrete example of a metric that does not look Euclidean, yet describes a perfectly flat two-dimensional plane. By working through this problem [@problem_id:1856078], you will perform the explicit calculations needed to both confirm the space's intrinsic flatness and find the specific coordinate change that transforms the metric into the familiar Euclidean form, $ds^2 = (dx')^2 + (dy')^2$.", "problem": "Consider a two-dimensional space whose geometry is described by the line element $ds^2 = dx^2 + 2b dx dy + dy^2$, where $(x, y)$ are coordinates and $b$ is a real constant.
