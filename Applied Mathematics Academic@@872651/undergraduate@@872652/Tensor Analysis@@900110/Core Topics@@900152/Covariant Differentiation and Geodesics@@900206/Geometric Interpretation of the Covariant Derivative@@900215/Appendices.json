The Euclidean plane has zero intrinsic curvature; nonzero Christoffel symbols reflect coordinate dependence, not intrinsic curvature. The length $|\\vec{g}_{\\theta}|=r$ is independent of $\\theta$, so its $\\theta$-derivative vanishes and does not equal $-r$.\n\nTherefore, the correct geometric interpretation is that the rate of change of the angular basis vector $\\vec{g}_{\\theta}$ along a curve of constant $r$ has a component $-r$ in the radial direction $\\vec{g}_{r}$, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1514758"}, {"introduction": "Now we move from a flat space to an intrinsically curved one—the surface of a sphere.
