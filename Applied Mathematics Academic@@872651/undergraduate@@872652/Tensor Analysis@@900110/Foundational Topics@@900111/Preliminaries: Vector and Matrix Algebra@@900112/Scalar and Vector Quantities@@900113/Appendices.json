In her system, the particle $P$ is located at coordinates $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$.

Specifically, $V_A = (d_{yz}, d_{xz}, d_{xy})$, where $d_{yz}$ is the perpendicular distance from $P$ to the $y-z$ plane, $d_{xz}$ is the distance to the $x-z$ plane, and $d_{xy}$ is the distance to the $x-y$ plane.\n\nBoris uses a different right-handed Cartesian coordinate system $S'$ with basis vectors $(\\hat{\\imath}', \\hat{\\jmath}', \\hat{k}')$ along axes $(x', y', z')$.
