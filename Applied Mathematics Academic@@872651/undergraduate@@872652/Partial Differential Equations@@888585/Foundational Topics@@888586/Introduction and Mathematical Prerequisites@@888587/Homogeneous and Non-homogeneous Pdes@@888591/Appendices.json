Seek nontrivial separated solutions of the form $u(x,y)=X(x)Y(y)$ in the interior. Substituting into the PDE gives\n$$\nX''(x)Y(y)+X(x)Y''(y)=0.\n$$\nAssuming $X$ and $Y$ are not identically zero, divide by $X(x)Y(y)$ to obtain\n$$\n\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}+\\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)}=0.\n$$\nTherefore each term equals a constant, say $-\\lambda$, yielding the system\n$$\n\\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}=-\\lambda, \\qquad \\frac{Y''(y)}{Y(y)}=\\lambda,\n$$\nor equivalently\n$$\nX''(x)+\\lambda X(x)=0, \\qquad Y''(y)-\\lambda Y(y)=0.\n$$\nWe analyze the three cases for $\\lambda$.\n\nCase $\\lambda > 0$: Let $\\lambda=\\alpha^{2}$ with $\\alpha > 0$.

Apply $X(0)=0$ to get $B=0$. Apply $X(L)=0$ to get $\\sin(\\alpha L)=0$, hence $\\alpha L=n\\pi$ for some positive integer $n$, so $\\alpha=\\frac{n\\pi}{L}$. For $Y$, apply $Y(0)=0$ to get $D=0$, and then $Y(H)=C\\sinh(\\alpha H)=0$. Since $H > 0$ and $\\alpha > 0$, we have $\\sinh(\\alpha H)\\neq 0$, so $C=0$. Thus $Y\\equiv 0$, and hence $u\\equiv 0$ for each such mode.\n\nCase $\\lambda = 0$: Then\n$$\nX''(x)=0, \\qquad Y''(y)=0.\n$$\nThe general solutions are $X(x)=a x+b$ and $Y(y)=c y+d$. Apply $X(0)=0$ to get $b=0$, and $X(L)=0$ to get $aL=0$, hence $a=0$, so $X\\equiv 0$, which implies $u\\equiv 0$.\n\nCase $\\lambda  0$: Let $\\lambda=-\\mu^{2}$ with $\\mu > 0$.

By linearity and superposition, no nontrivial linear combination can satisfy the boundary conditions unless it is identically zero.\n\nThis conclusion is also supported by the maximum principle for harmonic functions: a harmonic function on a bounded domain attains its maximum and minimum on the boundary. With boundary data $u=0$ everywhere, both the maximum and minimum are zero, so $u$ must be identically zero throughout the domain. The uniqueness theorem for the Dirichlet problem then guarantees that the steady-state temperature distribution is uniquely the trivial solution.
