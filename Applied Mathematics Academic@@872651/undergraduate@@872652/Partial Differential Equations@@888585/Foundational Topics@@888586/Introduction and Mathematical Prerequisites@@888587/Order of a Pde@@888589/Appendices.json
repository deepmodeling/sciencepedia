The operator is a squared binomial, which can be expanded as:\n$$(\\Delta - k^2)^2 = (\\Delta - k^2)(\\Delta - k^2)$$\nUsing the distributive property for operators, this becomes:\n$$(\\Delta - k^2)^2 = \\Delta(\\Delta - k^2) - k^2(\\Delta - k^2)$$\n$$(\\Delta - k^2)^2 = \\Delta \\cdot \\Delta - \\Delta \\cdot k^2 - k^2 \\cdot \\Delta + (-k^2)(-k^2)$$\nSince $k^2$ is a constant, it commutes with the differential operator $\\Delta$, meaning $\\Delta \\cdot k^2 = k^2 \\cdot \\Delta$.
