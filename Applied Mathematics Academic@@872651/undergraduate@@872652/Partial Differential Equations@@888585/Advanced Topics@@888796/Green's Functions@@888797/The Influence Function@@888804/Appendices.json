The general solution is a linear function of $x$. We must define the solution piecewise for the two domains separated by the point source at $\\xi$.\nLet the solution be\n$$\nG(x, \\xi) = \\begin{cases} G_1(x, \\xi) = A_1 x + B_1  0 \\le x  \\xi \\\\ G_2(x, \\xi) = A_2 x + B_2  \\xi  x \\le L \\end{cases}\n$$\nHere, the coefficients $A_1, B_1, A_2, B_2$ are constants with respect to $x$, but may depend on $\\xi$.\n\nNext, we apply the two boundary conditions.\nThe first boundary condition is at $x=0$, $G(0, \\xi) = 0$.
