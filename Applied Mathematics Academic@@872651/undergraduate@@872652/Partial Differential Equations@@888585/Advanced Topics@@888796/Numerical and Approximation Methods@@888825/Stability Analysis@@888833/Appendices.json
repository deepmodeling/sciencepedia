This first practice problem presents a classic and fundamental scenario: the competition between diffusion, which tends to smooth out variations, and a local reaction, which can amplify them. By analyzing a one-dimensional reaction-diffusion equation, you will determine the precise threshold at which the system's trivial (zero) state loses stability, providing a clear and concrete example of how a simple change in a single parameter can lead to complex behavior [@problem_id:2135620].", "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional system described by the reaction-diffusion equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\beta u $$\nThis equation models the concentration $u(x,t)$ of a substance over a spatial domain of length $L$, so that $x \\in [0, L]$.
