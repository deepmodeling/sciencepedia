The process is governed by the heat equation, $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}$, where $u(x,t)$ is the temperature at position $x$ and time $t$, and $D$ is the thermal diffusivity of the material. The bar has a length $L$. The initial temperature distribution is a sharp step function: at $t=0$, the temperature is $u(x,0) = U_0$ for the left half of the bar ($0 \\le x \\le L/2$) and $u(x,0) = 0$ for the right half ($L/2 < x \\le L$).

The Crank-Nicolson method is only conditionally stable, and the combination of the sharp initial condition and the chosen parameters $\\Delta t$ and $\\Delta x$ violates the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition, leading to an unstable, oscillating solution.\n\nB. The oscillations are a direct numerical manifestation of the Gibbs phenomenon. Any numerical method based on a finite grid-point representation will inevitably produce such overshoots when approximating a discontinuous function, regardless of the specific time-stepping scheme used.\n\nC. The implicit nature of the Crank-Nicolson scheme requires the solution of a tridiagonal system of linear equations at each time step. The sharp discontinuity in the initial data vector yields an ill-conditioned matrix, and the numerical errors from the linear solver are the source of the oscillatory behavior.\n\nD. The method suffers from significant numerical dispersion error, meaning that different Fourier components of the numerical solution travel at incorrect, frequency-dependent phase velocities. The high-frequency components, which are essential for representing the discontinuity, spread out and interfere, creating the observed \"wiggles\".\n\nE. Accurately representing a sharp discontinuity requires a wide spectrum of spatial Fourier modes.

The exact heat equation damps these modes strongly with factor $\\exp(-D k^{2} \\Delta t)$ over a time step. By contrast, the CN amplification factor for the discrete highest frequencies approaches $-1$ rather than $0$, so those components are not strongly attenuated and may invert phase between steps. This leads to persistent, non-physical oscillations (spatial “wiggles”) near the discontinuity that decay very slowly.\n\nThis mechanism is not Gibbs phenomenon per se (statement B), which concerns Fourier truncation overshoot independent of time-stepping. It is not due to ill-conditioning of the tridiagonal system (statement C), which remains well-conditioned and diagonally dominant for $s > 0$. It is not numerical dispersion (statement D), which pertains to wave propagation with phase velocity errors; the heat equation is diffusive, and the issue here is insufficient damping and sign inversion of high-frequency modes.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and fundamental explanation is that the CN amplification factor for the highest-frequency modes approaches $-1$, causing poor damping and phase inversion of the crucial high-frequency content required to represent the discontinuity, which produces the observed oscillations.
