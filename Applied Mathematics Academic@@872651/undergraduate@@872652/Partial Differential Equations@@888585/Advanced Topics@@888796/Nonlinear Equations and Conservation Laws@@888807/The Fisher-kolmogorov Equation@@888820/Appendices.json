The trivial solution $u(x)=0$ is always a solution. A non-trivial solution arises through a bifurcation from this trivial solution. The point of bifurcation can be found by analyzing the stability of the trivial solution. This is done by linearizing the governing equation around $u=0$.\n\nLet $u(x)$ be a small perturbation. For small $u$, the term $u^2$ is negligible compared to $u$.
