Let this derivative be $T_g'$. By definition, its action on a test function $\\phi(x)$ is given by:\n$$\n\\langle T_g', \\phi \\rangle = - \\langle T_g, \\phi' \\rangle\n$$\nSince $T_g$ is a regular distribution associated with the function $g(x)$, its action is defined by integration:\n$$\n\\langle T_g, \\phi' \\rangle = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} g(x) \\phi'(x) dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} H(ax+b) \\phi'(x) dx\n$$\nSo, we need to compute:\n$$\n\\langle T_g', \\phi \\rangle = - \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} H(ax+b) \\phi'(x) dx\n$$\nThe value of the Heaviside function $H(ax+b)$ depends on the sign of its argument, $ax+b$. Since $a$ is a non-zero constant, we need to consider two cases for the sign of $a$.\n\nCase 1: $a > 0$.\nIn this case, the inequality $ax+b > 0$ is equivalent to $ax > -b$, or $x > -b/a$.\nSo, the Heaviside function is:\n$$\nH(ax+b) = \\begin{cases} 1  \\text{if } x > -b/a \\\\ 0  \\text{if } x  -b/a \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe integral for the action of $T_g'$ becomes:\n$$\n\\langle T_g', \\phi \\rangle = - \\int_{-b/a}^{\\infty} 1 \\cdot \\phi'(x) dx\n$$\nWe can evaluate this integral using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:\n$$\n\\langle T_g', \\phi \\rangle = - [\\phi(x)]_{-b/a}^{\\infty} = - \\left( \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\phi(x) - \\phi(-b/a) \\right)\n$$\nSince $\\phi(x)$ is a test function, it must have compact support.

Comparing our result, we see that $\\langle T_g', \\phi \\rangle = \\langle \\delta(x - (-b/a)), \\phi \\rangle$.\nTherefore, for $a>0$, the distributional derivative is $T_g' = \\delta(x+b/a)$.\nComparing this with the required form $C \\delta(x-x_0)$, we have $C=1$ and $x_0 = -b/a$.\n\nCase 2: $a  0$.\nIn this case, the inequality $ax+b > 0$ is equivalent to $ax > -b$. Since $a$ is negative, dividing by $a$ reverses the inequality sign: $x  -b/a$.\nSo, the Heaviside function is:\n$$\nH(ax+b) = \\begin{cases} 1  \\text{if } x  -b/a \\\\ 0  \\text{if } x > -b/a \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe integral for the action of $T_g'$ becomes:\n$$\n\\langle T_g', \\phi \\rangle = - \\int_{-\\infty}^{-b/a} 1 \\cdot \\phi'(x) dx\n$$\nEvaluating the integral:\n$$\n\\langle T_g', \\phi \\rangle = - [\\phi(x)]_{-\\infty}^{-b/a} = - \\left( \\phi(-b/a) - \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} \\phi(x) \\right)\n$$\nAgain, due to the compact support of the test function $\\phi(x)$, we have $\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} \\phi(x) = 0$.\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n$$\n\\langle T_g', \\phi \\rangle = - (\\phi(-b/a) - 0) = -\\phi(-b/a)\n$$\nThis can be written as $\\langle T_g', \\phi \\rangle = \\langle -1 \\cdot \\delta(x - (-b/a)), \\phi \\rangle$.\nTherefore, for $a0$, the distributional derivative is $T_g' = -\\delta(x+b/a)$.\nComparing this with the form $C \\delta(x-x_0)$, we find $C=-1$ and $x_0 = -b/a$.\n\nTo combine both cases into a single expression, we can use the sign function, $\\text{sgn}(a)$, which is $1$ if $a0$ and $-1$ if $a0$.
