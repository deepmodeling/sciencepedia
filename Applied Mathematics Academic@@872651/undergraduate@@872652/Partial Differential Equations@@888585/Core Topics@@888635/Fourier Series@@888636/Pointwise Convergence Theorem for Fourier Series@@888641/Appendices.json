Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$S(t) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ f(t^+) + f(t^-) \\right]$$\nwhere $f(t^+) = \\lim_{h \\to 0^+} f(t+h)$ is the right-hand limit and $f(t^-) = \\lim_{h \\to 0^+} f(t-h)$ is the left-hand limit.\n\nFirst, we must evaluate these one-sided limits for the given function $f(t)$ at the point $t = 1.5$. The function consists of two parts: $c_1 t$ and $c_2 \\lfloor t + 0.5 \\rfloor$. The term $c_1 t$ is continuous everywhere. The term $c_2 \\lfloor t + 0.5 \\rfloor$ has jump discontinuities wherever its argument, $t+0.5$, is an integer. At $t=1.5$, the argument is $1.5 + 0.5 = 2$, which is an integer. Therefore, $f(t)$ has a jump discontinuity at $t=1.5$.\n\nLet's calculate the right-hand limit, $f(1.5^+)$:\n$$f(1.5^+) = \\lim_{h \\to 0^+} f(1.5 + h) = \\lim_{h \\to 0^+} \\left[ c_1(1.5 + h) + c_2 \\lfloor (1.5 + h) + 0.5 \\rfloor \\right]$$\n$$f(1.5^+) = \\lim_{h \\to 0^+} \\left[ c_1(1.5 + h) + c_2 \\lfloor 2 + h \\rfloor \\right]$$\nFor any small positive value of $h$, the floor of $2+h$ is $2$. So, the limit becomes:\n$$f(1.5^+) = c_1(1.5) + c_2(2) = \\frac{3}{2} c_1 + 2c_2$$\n\nNext, we calculate the left-hand limit, $f(1.5^-)$:\n$$f(1.5^-) = \\lim_{h \\to 0^+} f(1.5 - h) = \\lim_{h \\to 0^+} \\left[ c_1(1.5 - h) + c_2 \\lfloor (1.5 - h) + 0.5 \\rfloor \\right]$$\n$$f(1.5^-) = \\lim_{h \\to 0^+} \\left[ c_1(1.5 - h) + c_2 \\lfloor 2 - h \\rfloor \\right]$$\nFor any small positive value of $h$, the number $2-h$ is slightly less than $2$, so its floor is $1$. The limit becomes:\n$$f(1.5^-) = c_1(1.5) + c_2(1) = \\frac{3}{2} c_1 + c_2$$\n\nNow, we apply the convergence theorem by taking the average of the left-hand and right-hand limits:\n$$S(1.5) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ f(1.5^+) + f(1.5^-) \\right]$$\n$$S(1.5) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{3}{2} c_1 + 2c_2\\right) + \\left(\\frac{3}{2} c_1 + c_2\\right) \\right]$$\nCombining like terms inside the brackets:\n$$S(1.5) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{3}{2} c_1 + \\frac{3}{2} c_1\\right) + (2c_2 + c_2) \\right]$$\n$$S(1.5) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ 3c_1 + 3c_2 \\right]$$\nFactoring out the 3 gives the final expression:\n$$S(1.5) = \\frac{3}{2}(c_1 + c_2)$$\nThis is the value to which the Fourier series converges at $t=1.5$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}(c_1 + c_2)}$$", "id": "2126846"}, {"introduction": "Perhaps the most common source of discontinuity in Fourier analysis arises at the boundaries of the fundamental interval, created by the periodic extension of the function.
