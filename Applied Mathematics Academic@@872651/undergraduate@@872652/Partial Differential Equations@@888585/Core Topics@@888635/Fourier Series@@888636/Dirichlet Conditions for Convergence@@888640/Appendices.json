The function $f(x)$ represents the fractional part of $x$.\n\n**Analysis of the function $f(x)$:**\nThe function is piecewise linear. For any integer $n$, on the interval $[n, n+1)$, the floor function $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is constant and equal to $n$. Therefore, $f(x) = x - n$ for $x \\in [n, n+1)$.\nLet's look at the function on the interval $[-3, 3]$:\n- For $x \\in [-3, -2)$, $f(x) = x - (-3) = x+3$.\n- For $x \\in [-2, -1)$, $f(x) = x - (-2) = x+2$.\n- For $x \\in [-1, 0)$, $f(x) = x - (-1) = x+1$.\n- For $x \\in [0, 1)$, $f(x) = x - 0 = x$.\n- For $x \\in [1, 2)$, $f(x) = x - 1$.\n- For $x \\in [2, 3)$, $f(x) = x - 2$.\nAt the endpoint $x=3$, $f(3) = 3 - \\lfloor 3 \\rfloor = 3 - 3 = 0$.\n\nThe function's range is $[0, 1)$. It repeatedly ramps up from 0 to a value approaching 1, then drops back to 0 at each integer.\n\n**Step 1: Verify Condition (i) - Absolute Integrability**\nWe need to check if the integral $\\int_{-3}^3 |f(x)| \\, dx$ is finite.\nSince $f(x) = x - \\lfloor x \\rfloor \\ge 0$ for all $x$, we have $|f(x)| = f(x)$.\nThe integral can be broken down into a sum of integrals over each unit-length subinterval:\n$$ \\int_{-3}^3 f(x) \\, dx = \\int_{-3}^{-2} (x+3) \\, dx + \\int_{-2}^{-1} (x+2) \\, dx + \\int_{-1}^{0} (x+1) \\, dx + \\int_{0}^{1} x \\, dx + \\int_{1}^{2} (x-1) \\, dx + \\int_{2}^{3} (x-2) \\, dx $$\nEach of these integrals represents the area of a right-angled triangle with a base of 1 and a height of 1. The area of each triangle is $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1 \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nFor example, $\\int_{0}^{1} x \\, dx = \\left[ \\frac{x^2}{2} \\right]_0^1 = \\frac{1}{2}$. By a simple substitution ($u=x-n$), we can see that all six integrals are equal to $\\int_0^1 u \\, du = 1/2$.\nSo, the total integral is the sum of the areas of these six triangles:\n$$ \\int_{-3}^3 |f(x)| \\, dx = 6 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 3 $$\nSince the value of the integral is 3, which is finite, condition (i) is satisfied.\n\n**Step 2: Verify Condition (ii) - Finite Number of Extrema**\nWithin each open interval $(n, n+1)$, the function is $f(x) = x - n$, and its derivative is $f'(x) = 1$. Since the derivative is never zero, there are no local maxima or minima in the interior of these subintervals.\nThe extrema can only occur at the endpoints of these subintervals, which are the integer values in $[-3, 3]$.\nAt the integer points $x = -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2$, the function value is $f(x) = 0$. These are the locations of the local (and global) minima.\nAs $x$ approaches an integer $n$ from the left (i.e., $x \\to n^-$), the function value approaches 1. For example, $\\lim_{x \\to 1^-} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 1^-} x = 1$. These represent local maxima, which are located at the points of discontinuity.\nThe integer points where extrema are located are $\\{-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2\\}$. The points approached for maxima are $\\{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\\}$. The set of all these points is finite. Thus, the function has a finite number of local maxima and minima on the interval $[-3, 3]$. Condition (ii) is satisfied.\n\n**Step 3: Verify Condition (iii) - Finite Number of Finite Discontinuities**\nThe function $f(x) = x - \\lfloor x \\rfloor$ is continuous everywhere except at integer values of $x$. The integer values inside the interval $[-3, 3]$ are $-2, -1, 0, 1, 2$. We also need to check the endpoints.\nLet's analyze the behavior at an integer $n$:\n- The value at $n$ is $f(n) = n - \\lfloor n \\rfloor = 0$.\n- The limit from the right is $\\lim_{x \\to n^+} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to n^+} (x-n) = 0$. So the function is right-continuous at all integers.\n- The limit from the left is $\\lim_{x \\to n^-} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to n^-} (x-(n-1)) = n-(n-1)=1$.\nSince $\\lim_{x \\to n^-} f(x) \\neq f(n)$ for integers $n$, the function has jump discontinuities at these points.\nWithin the interval $[-3, 3]$, the points of discontinuity are the integers $x = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2$. We also check the boundary point $x=3$. As $x \\to 3^-$, $f(x) = x-2 \\to 1$, while $f(3)=0$. Thus, there is a discontinuity at $x=3$. At $x=-3$, the function is defined as $f(-3)=0$ and is right-continuous, so there is no discontinuity at the start of the interval of definition.\nThe points of discontinuity are $\\{-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\\}$. This is a finite set of 6 points.\nAt each discontinuity, the jump is from a limit of 1 to a value of 0. The magnitude of the jump is $|0 - 1| = 1$, which is a finite value.\nTherefore, the function has a finite number of finite discontinuities. Condition (iii) is satisfied.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe function $f(x) = x - \\lfloor x \\rfloor$ on the interval $[-3, 3]$ satisfies all three Dirichlet conditions.
