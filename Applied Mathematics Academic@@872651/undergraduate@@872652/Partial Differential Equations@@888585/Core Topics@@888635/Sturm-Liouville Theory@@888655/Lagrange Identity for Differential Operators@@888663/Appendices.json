This form is less general than C because it does not include the case $u'(0)=0$ (which would correspond to $\\beta=1, \\alpha=0$) or $u(0)=0$ (which would correspond to an infinite $h$).\n- Option D proposes that $\\alpha, \\beta$ can be complex. Let's test this. Assume the boundary condition is $u'(0) = \\gamma u(0)$ for a complex $\\gamma = -\\alpha/\\beta$. This means $v'(0) = \\gamma v(0)$. The self-adjointness condition $u'(0) \\overline{v(0)} - u(0) \\overline{v'(0)} = 0$ becomes:\n$$\n(\\gamma u(0)) \\overline{v(0)} - u(0) \\overline{(\\gamma v(0))} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\gamma u(0) \\overline{v(0)} - u(0) \\bar{\\gamma} \\overline{v(0)} = 0\n$$\n$$\n(\\gamma - \\bar{\\gamma}) u(0) \\overline{v(0)} = 0\n$$\nSince this must hold for any $u, v$ in the domain (and we can choose $u$ such that $u(0) \\neq 0$), we must have $\\gamma - \\bar{\\gamma} = 0$, which means $\\gamma$ must be real.
