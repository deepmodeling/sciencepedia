We will analyze the distribution of motor proteins on a filament, where the proteins are subject to diffusion, a bulk cytoplasmic flow (advection), and their own active movement (drift). This exercise is a powerful illustration of how to critically analyze the governing equation, as you will see that the opposing advection and drift velocities cancel each other out, reducing the problem to a familiar steady-state diffusion case [@problem_id:2096190].", "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional biological filament of length $L$ oriented along the x-axis, from $x=0$ to $x=L$. A species of protein is distributed along this filament with a concentration $u(x, t)$, which depends on position $x$ and time $t$. The proteins are subject to three transport phenomena: diffusion, advection, and drift.\n\n1.  The proteins undergo random thermal motion, which can be modeled as Fickian diffusion with a constant diffusion coefficient $D > 0$.\n2.  The filament is situated within a cellular environment where there is a bulk cytoplasmic flow, resulting in a constant advection velocity of $c > 0$ in the positive x-direction for all proteins.\n3.  The proteins are a type of motor protein that actively moves along the filament. This directed motion constitutes a drift velocity, $v$. For this particular system, the drift velocity is constant and directed toward the origin with a magnitude exactly equal to the advection velocity. Thus, the drift velocity is $v = -c$.\n\nThe ends of the filament are connected to reservoirs that maintain fixed protein concentrations. At $x=0$, the concentration is held at $u(0, t) = u_0$. At $x=L$, the concentration is held at $u(L, t) = u_L$.\n\nAfter a sufficiently long time, the system reaches a steady-state concentration profile.
