This problem challenges you to think about the steady-state, a condition where temperatures no longer change with time, and to understand how boundary conditions—like an insulated end versus one held at a fixed temperature—dictate the final temperature distribution. This exercise reveals the crucial role of heat flux and its connection to the temperature gradient in determining steady-state solutions [@problem_id:2125840].", "problem": "Consider a thin, homogeneous rod of length $L$ lying along the x-axis from $x=0$ to $x=L$. The rod is laterally insulated, so heat flows only in the x-direction. The temperature in the rod is described by the function $u(x, t)$, where $x$ is the position and $t$ is time. The evolution of temperature is governed by the one-dimensional heat equation without any internal heat sources:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = k \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nwhere $k  0$ is the constant thermal diffusivity of the material.\n\nThe boundary conditions are as follows:\n1.  The end at $x=0$ is perfectly insulated.\n2.  The end at $x=L$ is maintained at a constant temperature $T_0  0$.\n\nA steady-state temperature distribution, denoted by $U(x)$, is a solution that does not change with time. Based on the physical principles and mathematical model described, it is found that the only possible steady-state solution is a uniform temperature $U(x) = T_0$ for all $x$ in $[0, L]$.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate physical and mathematical explanation for why a non-uniform steady-state temperature distribution is impossible under these conditions?\n\nA. The presence of an insulated boundary means the total thermal energy in the rod must remain constant, which is only possible if the temperature is uniform.\n\nB. In any steady state without internal sources, the heat flux must be constant along the rod. The insulated boundary condition at $x=0$ requires this constant flux to be zero, which in turn implies the temperature gradient must be zero everywhere.\n\nC. A system with one insulated (Neumann) and one fixed-temperature (Dirichlet) boundary condition is mathematically overdetermined, and thus no stable solution can exist.\n\nD. Any initial heat in the rod will inevitably flow towards the end at $x=L$ and dissipate, causing the entire rod to cool down to a uniform temperature of absolute zero, contradicting the condition at $x=L$.\n\nE. The heat equation is a parabolic Partial Differential Equation (PDE), and such equations do not permit steady-state solutions when boundary conditions are of different types (Neumann and Dirichlet).", "solution": "A steady state is defined by a temperature field $U(x)$ that is independent of time, so $\\partial u/\\partial t=0$. Substituting $u(x,t)=U(x)$ into the heat equation gives\n$$\n0=k\\,\\frac{d^{2}U}{dx^{2}} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\frac{d^{2}U}{dx^{2}}=0.\n$$\nHence $U(x)$ is affine:\n$$\nU(x)=a x+b,\n$$\nwith constants $a$ and $b$.\n\nPhysically, Fourier’s law gives the heat flux $q(x,t)=-k\\,\\partial u/\\partial x$.

The physical and mathematical reason a non-uniform steady state is impossible is precisely that in steady state without sources the flux must be constant, the insulated end forces that constant to be zero, and thus the gradient must vanish everywhere. This matches statement B. By contrast: A confuses total energy conservation with spatial uniformity (constant total energy does not imply a uniform profile); C is incorrect since mixed Neumann–Dirichlet boundary conditions are standard and well-posed; D contradicts the maintained temperature $T_{0}$ and incorrectly asserts cooling to absolute zero; E is false because parabolic PDEs do admit steady states under mixed boundary conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2125840"}, {"introduction": "The speed of heat transfer depends not only on temperature differences but also on the intrinsic properties of the material itself.
