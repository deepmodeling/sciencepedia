[@problem_id:2089077]", "problem": "Consider the cooling of a thin, homogeneous circular metal plate of radius $R=1$ unit. The plate is perfectly insulated on its flat faces, so heat only flows radially.

Additionally, the temperature at the center of the plate must remain finite.\n\nThe initial temperature distribution at time $t=0$ is given by\n$$ u(r,0) = 5 J_{0}(z_1 r) - 2 J_{0}(z_3 r) $$\nwhere $J_0(z)$ is the Bessel function of the first kind of order zero, and the constants $z_n$ for $n=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$ are the positive roots of the equation $J_0(z)=0$, ordered increasingly ($0  z_1  z_2  z_3  \\ldots$).\n\nDetermine the temperature distribution $u(r,t)$ for all $t  0$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the solution to the radially symmetric heat equation on a circular disk with a given initial condition. The governing partial differential equation (PDE) is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial r^2} + \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r} $$\nThe boundary conditions are $u(1,t) = 0$ and $|u(0,t)|  \\infty$. The initial condition is $u(r,0) = 5 J_{0}(z_1 r) - 2 J_{0}(z_3 r)$.\n\nWe solve this PDE using the method of separation of variables. Let's assume a solution of the form $u(r,t) = F(r)T(t)$. Substituting this into the PDE gives:\n$$ F(r)T'(t) = (F''(r) + \\frac{1}{r}F'(r))T(t) $$\nWe can separate the variables by dividing by $F(r)T(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{T'(t)}{T(t)} = \\frac{F''(r) + \\frac{1}{r}F'(r)}{F(r)} $$\nSince the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side depends only on $r$, both sides must be equal to a constant. We will call this constant $-\\lambda^2$, where $\\lambda  0$.\n\nThis gives us two ordinary differential equations:\n1. Time-dependent equation: $T'(t) = -\\lambda^2 T(t)$\n2. Space-dependent equation: $r^2 F''(r) + r F'(r) + \\lambda^2 r^2 F(r) = 0$\n\nLet's solve the spatial equation first, as it is subject to boundary conditions. This is a well-known equation called Bessel's differential equation of order zero. Its general solution is:\n$$ F(r) = C_1 J_0(\\lambda r) + C_2 Y_0(\\lambda r) $$\nwhere $J_0$ and $Y_0$ are the Bessel functions of the first and second kind of order zero, respectively.\n\nWe apply the boundary conditions to find the constants $C_1$, $C_2$, and the eigenvalues $\\lambda$.\nThe condition that the temperature must be finite at the center of the plate, $|u(0,t)|  \\infty$, implies that $|F(0)|$ must be finite. The Bessel function of the second kind, $Y_0(\\lambda r)$, diverges as $r \\to 0$. Therefore, to keep the solution finite, we must set $C_2 = 0$.\nOur spatial solution is now of the form $F(r) = C_1 J_0(\\lambda r)$.\n\nNext, we apply the boundary condition at the edge of the plate, $u(1,t) = 0$, which implies $F(1)=0$.\n$$ C_1 J_0(\\lambda \\cdot 1) = 0 $$\nFor a non-trivial solution, we require $C_1 \\neq 0$, so we must have $J_0(\\lambda) = 0$.\nThe values of $\\lambda$ that satisfy this equation are the roots of the Bessel function $J_0$. Let these positive roots be denoted by $z_n$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots$, in increasing order. Thus, the eigenvalues are $\\lambda_n = z_n$.\nThe corresponding eigenfunctions are $F_n(r) = J_0(z_n r)$.\n\nNow we solve the time-dependent equation for each eigenvalue $\\lambda_n = z_n$:\n$$ T_n'(t) = -z_n^2 T_n(t) $$\nThis is a simple first-order linear ODE with the solution:\n$$ T_n(t) = D_n \\exp(-z_n^2 t) $$\nwhere $D_n$ is a constant.\n\nBy the principle of superposition, the general solution $u(r,t)$ is a linear combination of the product solutions $F_n(r)T_n(t)$:\n$$ u(r,t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n F_n(r)T_n(t) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n J_0(z_n r) \\exp(-z_n^2 t) $$\nwhere $A_n = C_1 D_n$ is a new set of constants, also known as the Fourier-Bessel coefficients.\n\nFinally, we use the initial condition $u(r,0)$ to determine the coefficients $A_n$. At $t=0$, the general solution becomes:\n$$ u(r,0) = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_n J_0(z_n r) $$\nThe problem provides the initial condition:\n$$ u(r,0) = 5 J_{0}(z_1 r) - 2 J_{0}(z_3 r) $$\nThe functions $J_0(z_n r)$ form an orthogonal set on the interval $[0,1]$ with respect to the weight function $r$. This means we can find the coefficients by inspection, by comparing the given initial condition to the series expansion.\nBy comparing the two expressions for $u(r,0)$, we can directly identify the non-zero coefficients:\n- The coefficient of $J_0(z_1 r)$ is 5, so $A_1 = 5$.\n- The coefficient of $J_0(z_3 r)$ is -2, so $A_3 = -2$.\n- There are no terms for $J_0(z_2 r)$, $J_0(z_4 r)$, etc., so all other coefficients $A_n$ are zero for $n \\neq 1, 3$.\n\nSubstituting these coefficients back into the general solution gives the particular solution for this problem. The solution is the sum of the terms for $n=1$ and $n=3$:\n$$ u(r,t) = A_1 J_0(z_1 r) \\exp(-z_1^2 t) + A_3 J_0(z_3 r) \\exp(-z_3^2 t) $$\n$$ u(r,t) = 5 J_0(z_1 r) \\exp(-z_1^2 t) - 2 J_0(z_3 r) \\exp(-z_3^2 t) $$\nThis is the final expression for the temperature distribution in the plate for $t > 0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{u(r,t) = 5 J_{0}(z_{1} r) \\exp(-z_{1}^{2} t) - 2 J_{0}(z_{3} r) \\exp(-z_{3}^{2} t)}$$", "id": "2089077"}, {"introduction": "Many real-world systems involve boundaries held at constant, non-zero temperatures.
