This exercise strips away the complexity of summing an infinite series, allowing us to focus on the core concept of modal decay. By solving this problem [@problem_id:2152312], you will see how a simple sinusoidal temperature distribution maintains its shape while its amplitude decreases exponentially over time, providing a foundational understanding for all Fourier series-based solutions to the heat equation.", "problem": "A thin, uniform rod made of a special-purpose alloy is being analyzed in a materials science laboratory. The rod has a length $L$ and is perfectly insulated along its cylindrical surface, restricting heat flow to be one-dimensional along its length. The thermal diffusivity of the alloy is a constant, denoted by $\\alpha$.\n\nAt the beginning of the experiment, $t=0$, the temperature distribution along the rod is established to be $u(x, 0) = A \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)$, where $x$ is the position coordinate along the rod ($0 \\le x \\le L$), $A$ is the maximum initial temperature, and $n$ is a positive integer defining the initial spatial mode of the temperature profile.\n\nFor all times $t > 0$, both ends of the rod (at $x=0$ and $x=L$) are connected to large heat sinks that maintain them at a constant temperature of zero. The evolution of the temperature $u(x, t)$ within the rod is governed by the one-dimensional heat equation.\n\nFind the temperature distribution $u(x, t)$ for any position $x \\in [0, L]$ and time $t \\ge 0$. Express your answer as a function of the variables $x, t$ and the parameters $A, n, L, \\alpha$.", "solution": "The physical scenario is described by the one-dimensional heat equation, a partial differential equation (PDE):\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} $$\nThe problem is defined on the domain $0 \\le x \\le L$ and for time $t \\ge 0$.\n\nThe boundary conditions (BCs) are given by the fixed zero temperature at the ends:\n1. $u(0, t) = 0$ for all $t > 0$.\n2. $u(L, t) = 0$ for all $t > 0$.\n\nThe initial condition (IC) is the specified sinusoidal temperature profile at $t=0$:\n$$ u(x, 0) = A \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) $$\n\nWe solve this PDE using the method of separation of variables. We assume a solution of the form $u(x, t) = X(x)T(t)$, where $X(x)$ is a function of position only, and $T(t)$ is a function of time only.\n\nSubstituting this into the heat equation gives:\n$$ X(x) \\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = \\alpha T(t) \\frac{d^2X(x)}{dx^2} $$\nDividing by $\\alpha X(x)T(t)$ separates the variables:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\alpha T(t)}\\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = \\frac{1}{X(x)}\\frac{d^2X(x)}{dx^2} $$\nSince the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side depends only on $x$, both sides must be equal to a constant. We denote this separation constant as $-\\lambda^2$ for convenience (the negative sign is chosen to ensure non-trivial solutions that satisfy the boundary conditions).\n\nThis gives two ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n1. Time-dependent ODE: $\\frac{dT}{dt} = -\\alpha \\lambda^2 T$\n2. Space-dependent ODE: $\\frac{d^2X}{dx^2} = -\\lambda^2 X$, or $X'' + \\lambda^2 X = 0$\n\nFirst, we solve the spatial ODE, $X'' + \\lambda^2 X = 0$. The general solution is:\n$$ X(x) = C_1 \\cos(\\lambda x) + C_2 \\sin(\\lambda x) $$\nWe apply the boundary conditions to find the constants $C_1, C_2$ and the allowed values of $\\lambda$.\nFrom $u(0, t) = 0$, we have $X(0)T(t) = 0$. Since we seek a non-trivial solution ($T(t) \\not\\equiv 0$), we must have $X(0)=0$.\n$$ X(0) = C_1 \\cos(0) + C_2 \\sin(0) = C_1 = 0 $$\nSo, the solution simplifies to $X(x) = C_2 \\sin(\\lambda x)$.\n\nFrom $u(L, t) = 0$, we have $X(L)T(t) = 0$, which implies $X(L)=0$.\n$$ X(L) = C_2 \\sin(\\lambda L) = 0 $$\nFor a non-trivial solution, $C_2$ cannot be zero, so we must have $\\sin(\\lambda L) = 0$. This condition is met when $\\lambda L$ is an integer multiple of $\\pi$.\n$$ \\lambda L = m\\pi, \\quad \\text{for } m = 1, 2, 3, \\dots $$\nThe case $m=0$ gives $\\lambda=0$ and $X(x)=0$, which is the trivial solution and is ignored. Negative values of $m$ do not produce new independent solutions.\nThe allowed values for $\\lambda$ are the eigenvalues $\\lambda_m = \\frac{m\\pi}{L}$. The corresponding solutions for $X(x)$ are the eigenfunctions $X_m(x) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{m\\pi x}{L}\\right)$. We can absorb the constant $C_2$ into the time-dependent solution.\n\nNext, we solve the time-dependent ODE for each allowed $\\lambda_m$:\n$$ \\frac{dT_m}{dt} = -\\alpha \\lambda_m^2 T_m = -\\alpha \\left(\\frac{m\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 T_m $$\nThis is a first-order linear ODE whose solution is an exponential decay:\n$$ T_m(t) = D_m \\exp\\left(-\\alpha \\left(\\frac{m\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 t\\right) $$\nwhere $D_m$ is a constant.\n\nThe general solution $u(x, t)$ is a linear superposition of all possible product solutions $u_m(x, t) = X_m(x)T_m(t)$. We combine the constants $D_m$ into a new set of coefficients $B_m$.\n$$ u(x, t) = \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} u_m(x, t) = \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} B_m \\sin\\left(\\frac{m\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\alpha \\left(\\frac{m\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 t\\right) $$\nThis is a Fourier sine series. The coefficients $B_m$ are determined by the initial condition $u(x, 0)$.\nAt $t=0$:\n$$ u(x, 0) = \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} B_m \\sin\\left(\\frac{m\\pi x}{L}\\right) $$\nWe are given the initial condition $u(x, 0) = A \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right)$. By comparing this with the Fourier series, we can determine the coefficients $B_m$ by inspection.\n$$ A \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) = B_1 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi x}{L}\\right) + B_2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right) + \\dots + B_n \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) + \\dots $$\nThe initial condition is already in the form of a single term of the Fourier sine series. This implies that only one coefficient is non-zero. For the two expressions to be equal for all $x$, the coefficients of the corresponding sine terms must be equal.\nThis gives:\n- $B_n = A$\n- $B_m = 0$ for all $m \\neq n$.\n\nTherefore, the infinite series collapses to a single term, corresponding to $m=n$. Substituting these coefficients back into the general solution gives the final specific solution:\n$$ u(x, t) = A \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\alpha \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 t\\right) $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\alpha \\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{L}\\right)^{2} t\\right)}$$", "id": "2152312"}, {"introduction": "Having examined how an initial temperature profile decays, we now turn to a system with an active, continuous internal heat source.
