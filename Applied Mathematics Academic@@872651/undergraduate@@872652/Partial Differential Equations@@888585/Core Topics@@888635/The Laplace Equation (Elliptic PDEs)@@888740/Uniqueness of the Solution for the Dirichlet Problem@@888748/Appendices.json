We begin our hands-on exploration with the simplest case: the steady-state temperature in a one-dimensional rod. This exercise [@problem_id:2153920] demonstrates that by using direct integration—a tool from basic calculus—we can rigorously prove that only one temperature profile can satisfy the governing equation and the fixed temperatures at the ends.", "problem": "A physicist is modeling the steady-state temperature distribution, $u(x)$, within a thin, uniform rod oriented along the x-axis. The rod occupies the region $x \\in [a, b]$, where $a$ and $b$ are positions with $b > a$. In the absence of internal heat sources, the temperature profile is governed by the one-dimensional Laplace equation, $u''(x) = 0$. The ends of the rod are maintained at fixed, known temperatures: $u(a) = A$ and $u(b) = B$.\n\nTo confirm that the mathematical model yields a single, predictable temperature distribution, you are asked to investigate its uniqueness. Assume, for the sake of argument, that two different functions, $u_1(x)$ and $u_2(x)$, could both be valid solutions. This means that both functions satisfy the same differential equation and the same boundary conditions.\n\nDefine a difference function $w(x) = u_1(x) - u_2(x)$. Determine the explicit form of this function $w(x)$ for all $x$ in the interval $[a, b]$. Your answer should be an expression that may involve the constants $a, b, A,$ and $B$, but should not depend on the variable $x$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the explicit form of the difference function $w(x) = u_1(x) - u_2(x)$, where $u_1(x)$ and $u_2(x)$ are two hypothetical solutions to the given boundary value problem.\n\nFirst, let's state the conditions that both $u_1(x)$ and $u_2(x)$ must satisfy.\nFor $u_1(x)$:\n1.  The differential equation: $u_1''(x) = 0$ for $x \\in (a, b)$.\n2.  The boundary conditions: $u_1(a) = A$ and $u_1(b) = B$.\n\nFor $u_2(x)$:\n1.  The differential equation: $u_2''(x) = 0$ for $x \\in (a, b)$.\n2.  The boundary conditions: $u_2(a) = A$ and $u_2(b) = B$.\n\nNext, we establish the differential equation that the difference function $w(x) = u_1(x) - u_2(x)$ must satisfy. Since the differentiation operator is linear, we can write:\n$$w''(x) = \\frac{d^2}{dx^2}(u_1(x) - u_2(x)) = \\frac{d^2 u_1}{dx^2} - \\frac{d^2 u_2}{dx^2}$$\nSubstituting the governing equations for $u_1$ and $u_2$:\n$$w''(x) = 0 - 0 = 0$$\nSo, the difference function $w(x)$ also satisfies the same homogeneous differential equation.\n\nNow, we determine the boundary conditions for $w(x)$.\nAt $x=a$:\n$$w(a) = u_1(a) - u_2(a) = A - A = 0$$\nAt $x=b$:\n$$w(b) = u_1(b) - u_2(b) = B - B = 0$$\nSo, $w(x)$ must satisfy homogeneous boundary conditions, i.e., $w(a)=0$ and $w(b)=0$.\n\nWe now solve the boundary value problem for $w(x)$: $w''(x)=0$ with $w(a)=0$ and $w(b)=0$.\nWe find the general solution for $w(x)$ by integrating $w''(x)=0$ twice with respect to $x$.\nIntegrating once gives:\n$$w'(x) = C_1$$\nwhere $C_1$ is a constant of integration.\nIntegrating a second time gives:\n$$w(x) = C_1 x + C_2$$\nwhere $C_2$ is a second constant of integration. This is the general solution for $w(x)$.\n\nTo find the specific solution, we apply the boundary conditions for $w(x)$.\nUsing $w(a)=0$:\n$$C_1 a + C_2 = 0 \\quad (1)$$\nUsing $w(b)=0$:\n$$C_1 b + C_2 = 0 \\quad (2)$$\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations for the two unknown constants $C_1$ and $C_2$. To solve this system, we can subtract equation (1) from equation (2):\n$$(C_1 b + C_2) - (C_1 a + C_2) = 0 - 0$$\n$$C_1 b - C_1 a = 0$$\n$$C_1 (b-a) = 0$$\nThe problem specifies that the rod exists on an interval $[a, b]$ with $b > a$, which means $b-a \\neq 0$. For the product $C_1(b-a)$ to be zero, it must be that $C_1=0$.\n\nNow, substitute $C_1=0$ back into equation (1):\n$$(0)a + C_2 = 0$$\n$$C_2 = 0$$\n\nSince both constants of integration are zero, the function $w(x)$ is:\n$$w(x) = (0)x + 0 = 0$$\nThis holds for all $x$ in the interval $[a, b]$. The fact that $w(x) = u_1(x) - u_2(x) = 0$ implies that $u_1(x)=u_2(x)$, demonstrating that the solution to the original boundary value problem is unique.
