The small vertical displacement of the membrane at a radial distance $r$ from the center at time $t$ is denoted by $u(r, t)$. For vibrations that are radially symmetric (i.e., do not depend on the angle), the displacement is governed by the two-dimensional wave equation in polar coordinates:\n$$\nu_{tt} = c^2 \\left( u_{rr} + \\frac{1}{r} u_r \\right)\n$$\nfor $0 \\le r  a$ and $t \\ge 0$, where $c$ is a constant representing the wave propagation speed.

The term $r$ is a necessary weighting factor that allows for the use of integration by parts to show that the time derivative of energy, $\\frac{dE}{dt}$, is zero, which is the key step in the uniqueness proof.\n\nC. The term $r$ is required to cancel the $1/r$ singularity present in the wave equation, ensuring that the integral for energy is always well-defined and finite at the center $r=0$.\n\nD. The term $r$ is introduced for dimensional consistency. Integrating the quantity $(u_t^2 + c^2 u_r^2)$, which has units of velocity squared, with respect to the radius $r$ alone does not yield a quantity with the physical units of energy.\n\nE. The term $r$ accounts for the physical fact that the tension in the membrane is not uniform but increases linearly with the distance from the center.", "solution": "The correct answer is A. Here is a detailed step-by-step reasoning for why A is the correct choice and why the other options are either incorrect or less fundamental.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the physical origin of the energy functional.\nThe total energy of a vibrating membrane is the sum of its kinetic energy and potential energy, integrated over its entire surface area.\nThe kinetic energy density (energy per unit area) is given by $\\mathcal{K} = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho u_t^2$, where $\\rho$ is the constant mass per unit area of the membrane.\nThe potential energy density, associated with the stretching of the membrane, is given by $\\mathcal{P} = \\frac{1}{2} T |\\nabla u|^2$, where $T$ is the constant tension per unit length.\nThe total energy, $\\mathcal{E}_{\\text{total}}$, is the integral of the total energy density ($\\mathcal{K} + \\mathcal{P}$) over the area of the circular membrane, which we will call $D$.\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}_{\\text{total}}(t) = \\iint_D (\\mathcal{K} + \\mathcal{P}) \\, dA = \\iint_D \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\rho u_t^2 + \\frac{1}{2} T |\\nabla u|^2 \\right) \\, dA\n$$\n\nStep 2: Express the integral in polar coordinates.\nFor a problem with circular symmetry, it is natural to use polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$. The area element in polar coordinates is $dA = r \\, dr \\, d\\theta$.\nThe squared magnitude of the gradient in polar coordinates is $|\\nabla u|^2 = (\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r})^2 + \\frac{1}{r^2}(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\theta})^2$.\nSince the problem states that the solution is radially symmetric, $u$ depends only on $r$ and $t$, so $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\theta} = 0$. This simplifies the gradient term to $|\\nabla u|^2 = u_r^2$.\nSubstituting these into the total energy integral:\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}_{\\text{total}}(t) = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^a \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\rho u_t^2 + \\frac{1}{2} T u_r^2 \\right) r \\, dr \\, d\\theta\n$$\n\nStep 3: Simplify the integral.\nThe integrand does not depend on $\\theta$, so the integration with respect to $\\theta$ simply yields a factor of $2\\pi$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}_{\\text{total}}(t) = 2\\pi \\int_0^a \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\rho u_t^2 + \\frac{1}{2} T u_r^2 \\right) r \\, dr\n$$\nFactoring out the constants gives:\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}_{\\text{total}}(t) = \\pi \\rho \\int_0^a \\left( u_t^2 + \\frac{T}{\\rho} u_r^2 \\right) r \\, dr\n$$\nThe wave speed $c$ in the wave equation for a membrane is defined as $c^2 = T/\\rho$. Substituting this in:\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}_{\\text{total}}(t) = \\pi \\rho \\int_0^a (u_t^2 + c^2 u_r^2) r \\, dr\n$$\nThe energy functional $E(t)$ given in the problem statement is exactly this physical total energy, divided by the constant mass density $\\rho$.\n$$\nE(t) = \\frac{\\mathcal{E}_{\\text{total}}(t)}{\\rho} = \\pi \\int_0^a (u_t^2 + c^2 u_r^2) r \\, dr\n$$\nThis derivation clearly shows that the factor of $r$ is a direct and unavoidable consequence of the area element $dA = r \\, dr \\, d\\theta$ used to integrate the energy density over the two-dimensional domain. Therefore, option A provides the most fundamental reason.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the other options.\n\nB. This option describes the mathematical utility of the factor $r$ in the proof of uniqueness using the energy method. If one computes $\\frac{dE}{dt}$, the factor of $r$ is precisely what is needed to group terms into a perfect derivative with respect to $r$ (using integration by parts), which then vanishes due to the boundary conditions. While this is true and mathematically important, it is a *consequence* of the correct physical definition of energy. The mathematical method works because it correctly models the physics; the physics is not dictated by the convenience of the mathematical method. Thus, A is more fundamental than B.\n\nC. This option suggests the factor of $r$ is to cure a singularity. While the PDE has a $1/r$ term, for any physically reasonable solution, the displacement must be smooth at the center, which implies that $u_r(0, t) = 0$. In this case, L'Hôpital's rule shows that $\\lim_{r\\to 0} \\frac{u_r}{r} = u_{rr}(0, t)$, so the term $u_{rr} + \\frac{1}{r}u_r$ is well-behaved. The integral for energy without the $r$ factor, $\\int_0^a (u_t^2 + c^2 u_r^2) \\, dr$, would also be finite for such smooth solutions. The primary role of the factor of $r$ is not to ensure convergence but to correctly represent the area over which the energy density is summed.\n\nD. This option about dimensional consistency is misleading. The functional $E(t)$ in the problem has units of $[L^4]/[T^2]$ (since $u_t^2$ and $c^2u_r^2$ have units of $[L/T]^2$, and we integrate $[L/T]^2 \\times [L] \\times [L]$). The true physical energy has units of $[M][L^2]/[T^2]$. Neither the proposed functional $E(t)$ nor one without the factor of $r$ has the units of physical energy without including other constants like mass density $\\rho$. The inclusion of $r$ comes from the geometry (Area = Length $\\times$ Length), not from a simple dimensional fix.\n\nE. This option proposes a physical model that is contrary to the premise. The term \"homogeneous membrane\" implies that its physical properties, including tension $T$ and mass density $\\rho$, are uniform throughout the material and do not depend on the position $r$.\n\nConclusion: The factor of $r$ in the energy integral is a direct consequence of transforming the area integral of energy density from Cartesian to polar coordinates. Option A correctly identifies this fundamental geometric origin.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2154493"}]}
