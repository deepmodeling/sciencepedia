The endpoints $x_{min}$ and $x_{max}$ are the starting positions of the two characteristic curves that arrive at the point $(x_0, t_0)$. Characteristics are paths in the $(x,t)$-plane along which information propagates, and their slope is given by $\\frac{dt}{dx} = \\pm \\frac{1}{c(x)}$, which is equivalent to $\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\pm c(x)$. To find the domain of dependence, we trace these paths backward in time from $(x_0, t_0)$ to the line $t=0$.\n\nFirst, let's determine the right endpoint of the interval, $x_{max}$. A signal starting at $(x_{max}, 0)$ must travel leftwards to reach $(x_0, t_0)$. The path starts at $x_{max}$ and ends at $x_0$. Since $x_0 > 0$ and the signal travels to the left, we must have $x_{max} > x_0$. Therefore, this entire characteristic path lies within the region $x > 0$, where the speed is $c_2$. The velocity of the signal is $-c_2$. The position of the signal at time $t$ is given by $x(t) = x_{max} - c_2 t$. For the signal to reach $x_0$ at time $t_0$, we must have:\n$$\nx_0 = x_{max} - c_2 t_0\n$$\nSolving for $x_{max}$ gives:\n$$\nx_{max} = x_0 + c_2 t_0\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the left endpoint of the interval, $x_{min}$. A signal starting at $(x_{min}, 0)$ must travel rightwards to reach $(x_0, t_0)$. The problem states that $c_2 t_0 > x_0$. This condition implies that the time taken to travel from the fault line at $x=0$ to $x_0$ at speed $c_2$, which is $x_0/c_2$, is less than the total available time $t_0$. This means the characteristic path must originate in the region $x < 0$, cross the fault line at $x=0$, and then continue to $x_0$. This \"refracted\" path consists of two segments.\n\nLet's denote the time at which the characteristic crosses the fault line $x=0$ as $t_i$.\n\nSegment 1: The path from the crossing point $(0, t_i)$ to the final point $(x_0, t_0)$. This segment is entirely in the region $x > 0$, where the speed is $c_2$. The signal travels rightwards, so its velocity is $+c_2$. The position along this path is given by $x(t) = 0 + c_2 (t - t_i)$. At time $t_0$, the position is $x_0$, so:\n$$\nx_0 = c_2 (t_0 - t_i)\n$$\nWe can solve for the crossing time $t_i$:\n$$\nt_i = t_0 - \\frac{x_0}{c_2}\n$$\nThe problem's condition $c_2 t_0 > x_0$ ensures that $t_i > 0$, confirming that the crossing happens after time $t=0$.\n\nSegment 2: The path from the starting point $(x_{min}, 0)$ to the crossing point $(0, t_i)$. This segment is entirely in the region $x < 0$, where the speed is $c_1$. The signal travels rightwards, so its velocity is $+c_1$. The position is given by $x(t) = x_{min} + c_1 t$. At time $t_i$, the position is $x=0$:\n$$\n0 = x_{min} + c_1 t_i\n$$\nThis gives us a relation for $x_{min}$:\n$$\nx_{min} = -c_1 t_i\n$$\n\nNow we can find $x_{min}$ by substituting the expression for $t_i$ from Segment 1 into the result from Segment 2:\n$$\nx_{min} = -c_1 \\left(t_0 - \\frac{x_0}{c_2}\\right) = \\frac{c_1}{c_2}x_0 - c_1 t_0\n$$\n\nFinally, the width of the domain of dependence, $W$, is the difference between the endpoints $x_{max}$ and $x_{min}$:\n$$\nW = x_{max} - x_{min}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions we found:\n$$\nW = (x_0 + c_2 t_0) - \\left(\\frac{c_1}{c_2}x_0 - c_1 t_0\\right)\n$$\n$$\nW = x_0 - \\frac{c_1}{c_2}x_0 + c_2 t_0 + c_1 t_0\n$$\nGrouping terms by $x_0$ and $t_0$:\n$$\nW = x_0\\left(1 - \\frac{c_1}{c_2}\\right) + t_0(c_1 + c_2)\n$$\nThis is the total width of the domain of dependence.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{x_0\\left(1 - \\frac{c_1}{c_2}\\right) + t_0(c_1 + c_2)}$$", "id": "2098694"}]}
