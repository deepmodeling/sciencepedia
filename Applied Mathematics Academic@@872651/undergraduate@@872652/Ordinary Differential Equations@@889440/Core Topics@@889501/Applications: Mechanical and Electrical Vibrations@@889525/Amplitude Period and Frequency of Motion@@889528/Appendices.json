The frame is securely attached to the ground. In the absence of seismic vibrations, the mass hangs motionless at an equilibrium position, having stretched the spring downwards due to the force of gravity. We are interested in characterizing the instrument's natural oscillatory behavior. If the mass is displaced by a small vertical distance from its equilibrium position and then released, it will oscillate. Assuming the local acceleration due to gravity is $g$, find the analytical expression for the period $T$ of these small vertical oscillations.", "solution": "Let downward be the positive direction.
