For $k\\leq -2$, a log term occurs.\n- Property 3 (at least one Frobenius solution is a polynomial in $x$) demands that the prefactor $x^{r}$ not introduce negative powers. The only truncating case is the $r=-k$ series for $k\\geq 0$. This yields $y_{2}(x)=x^{-k}P_{k}(x)$, which is a polynomial in $x$ if and only if $-k\\geq 0$, i.e., $k\\leq 0$.
