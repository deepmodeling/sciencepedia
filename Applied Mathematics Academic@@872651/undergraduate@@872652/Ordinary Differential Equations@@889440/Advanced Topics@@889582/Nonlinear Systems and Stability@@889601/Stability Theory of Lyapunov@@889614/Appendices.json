This first exercise focuses on a critical prerequisite: the positive definite property, which ensures the function behaves like an \"energy\" measure with a unique minimum at the equilibrium.

To do this, the student plans to use Lyapunov's direct method. According to this method, a function $V(\\mathbf{x})$ can serve as a candidate Lyapunov function to analyze stability if it is continuous, possesses continuous first partial derivatives, and is positive definite in a neighborhood of the origin. A function $V(\\mathbf{x})$ is defined as positive definite at the origin if $V(0,0)=0$ and $V(\\mathbf{x}) > 0$ for all $\\mathbf{x} \\neq (0,0)$ within that neighborhood.\n\nThe student proposes the candidate function $V(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2}x^4$.

The function is suitable for proving stability if its time derivative $\\dot{V}$ is negative semi-definite, and it is suitable for proving asymptotic stability if $\\dot{V}$ is negative definite.\n\nB. The function can, at best, be used to show the system is unstable using Chetaev's instability theorem, but it can never be used to prove stability.\n\nC.

The function is suitable for analyzing the stability of the system, but only for initial conditions on the x-axis.", "solution": "We apply the Lyapunov candidate requirements stated in the problem: a function $V(\\mathbf{x})$ must be continuous, continuously differentiable, and positive definite in a neighborhood of the origin, meaning\n$$\nV(0,0)=0,\\quad V(x,y)0\\ \\text{for all }(x,y)\\neq(0,0)\\ \\text{near the origin}.\n$$\nConsider the proposed $V(x,y)=\\frac{1}{2}x^{4}$.

Therefore $V$ is positive semidefinite, not positive definite.\n\nBy the definition given, this disqualifies $V$ as a Lyapunov function candidate for proving stability via Lyapunov’s direct method, since that method requires positive definiteness to relate level sets of $V$ to neighborhoods of the origin.\n\nFor completeness, its derivative along trajectories is\n$$\n\\dot{V}(x,y)=\\nabla V(x,y)\\cdot \\mathbf{f}(x,y)=\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x}f_{1}(x,y)+\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y}f_{2}(x,y)=2x^{3}f_{1}(x,y),\n$$\nand along the $y$-axis (where $x=0$) we get $\\dot{V}(0,y)=0$ regardless of $\\mathbf{f}$.
