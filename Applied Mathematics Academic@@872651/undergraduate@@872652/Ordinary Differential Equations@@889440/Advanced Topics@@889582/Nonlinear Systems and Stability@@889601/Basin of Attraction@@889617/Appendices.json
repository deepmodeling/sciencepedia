Specifically:\n- For $x \\in (0, \\sqrt{\\mu})$, we have $x  0$ and $\\mu - x^{2}  0$, hence $f(x)  0$ and solutions increase; for $x \\in (\\sqrt{\\mu}, \\infty)$, we have $x  0$ and $\\mu - x^{2}  0$, hence $f(x)  0$ and solutions decrease. Therefore any trajectory starting with $x_{0}  0$ remains positive for all forward time and moves monotonically toward $x = \\sqrt{\\mu}$. It cannot cross $x = 0$ due to uniqueness of solutions for Lipschitz vector fields and because $x = 0$ is an equilibrium; if a trajectory were to reach $0$ in finite time, it would have to coincide with the equilibrium thereafter, contradicting uniqueness for the given initial condition $x_{0}  0$.\n- For $x \\in (-\\sqrt{\\mu}, 0)$, we have $x  0$ and $\\mu - x^{2}  0$, hence $f(x)  0$ and solutions decrease (become more negative); for $x \\in (-\\infty, -\\sqrt{\\mu})$, we have $x  0$ and $\\mu - x^{2}  0$, hence $f(x)  0$ and solutions increase (become less negative).

This problem uses the damped Duffing equation, a well-known model in nonlinear dynamics, to investigate the boundary separating two basins of attraction. You will learn the fundamental principle that this boundary, often intricate in shape, is formed by the stable manifold of an unstable saddle point, providing a deep connection between the geometry of trajectories and the system's global dynamics [@problem_id:2160830].", "problem": "An engineering student is studying the behavior of a nonlinear mechanical system described by the damped Duffing equation, a model for a periodically forced oscillator with a nonlinear restoring force.

To analyze the system's long-term behavior in its phase space, the student converts this second-order Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) into a system of first-order ODEs by setting the velocity $y = \\frac{dx}{dt}$:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = y $$\n$$ \\frac{dy}{dt} = x - x^3 - \\delta y $$\nFor any positive value of $\\delta$, this system has three equilibrium points: two stable sinks (attractors) located at $P_1 = (-1, 0)$ and $P_2 = (1, 0)$, and one unstable saddle point at the origin $S = (0, 0)$. Every initial condition $(x_0, y_0)$ in the phase plane, except for a set of measure zero, will evolve towards one of the two attractors. The set of all initial conditions that converge to $P_1$ is called its basin of attraction, $\\mathcal{B}(P_1)$. Similarly, the set of all initial conditions that converge to $P_2$ is its basin, $\\mathcal{B}(P_2)$.\n\nTo visualize these basins, the student performs a numerical experiment with $\\delta = 0.25$. They create a fine grid of initial points in the phase space region defined by $-2 \\leq x \\leq 2$ and $-2 \\leq y \\leq 2$. For each initial point $(x_0, y_0)$, they numerically integrate the system for a long time $T$ and observe the final state $(x(T), y(T))$. If the final state is closer to $P_1$, they color the initial grid point blue; if it is closer to $P_2$, they color it red. The resulting plot shows two large regions, one blue and one red, separated by a complex boundary.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate theoretical description of the boundary separating the basins of attraction $\\mathcal{B}(P_1)$ and $\\mathcal{B}(P_2)$?\n\nA) The boundary is a simple straight line passing through the saddle point at the origin.\nB) The boundary is a smooth, simple closed curve (like a circle or an ellipse) that encloses the saddle point.\nC) The boundary is precisely the stable manifold of the saddle point at the origin.\nD) The boundary is precisely the unstable manifold of the saddle point at the origin.\nE) The boundary is formed by a single homoclinic orbit that connects the saddle point to itself.", "solution": "We are given the autonomous planar system\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt}=y,\\qquad \\frac{dy}{dt}=x-x^{3}-\\delta y,\n$$\nwith $\\delta0$.

Their common boundary must be invariant under the forward flow: if a trajectory starting on the boundary were to enter strictly into one basin at some future time, then by continuity a neighborhood of the initial point would lie in that basin, contradicting that it is a boundary point.\n\nLet $p$ be a boundary point. Its $\\omega$-limit set cannot be $P_{1}$ or $P_{2}$; otherwise, by asymptotic stability, a neighborhood of $p$ would also converge to that sink and thus lie inside its basin, not on the boundary. It also cannot be a periodic orbit or homoclinic orbit, since none exist by the Lyapunov argument above. Therefore the only remaining possible $\\omega$-limit is the saddle $S=(0,0)$, which implies $p\\in W^{s}(S)$ by definition of the stable manifold.\n\nConversely, any point on $W^{s}(S)$ separates initial conditions whose forward trajectories approach different sinks: near the saddle, the unstable manifold $W^{u}(S)$ has two branches that exit the saddle toward the two different sinks, and the local stable manifold is the set that does not immediately depart toward one sink or the other; globally, $W^{s}(S)$ forms the separatrix. Hence the boundary between $\\mathcal{B}(P_{1})$ and $\\mathcal{B}(P_{2})$ is precisely $W^{s}(S)$.\n\nThis rules out all the alternatives:\n- A) A straight line is not generally the global separatrix; the boundary is the nonlinear stable manifold curve, which is only tangent to the stable eigenvector at the saddle locally.\n- B) A smooth simple closed curve enclosing the saddle cannot be the basin boundary in this dissipative gradient-like system.\n- D) The unstable manifold consists of trajectories leaving the saddle toward the sinks and lies within the basins, not forming their boundary.\n- E) A single homoclinic orbit does not exist here because $E$ strictly decreases off equilibria.\n\nTherefore the correct description is that the boundary is the stable manifold of the saddle at the origin.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2160830"}]}
