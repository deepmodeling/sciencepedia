The population can be divided into three groups: susceptible individuals ($S$), infected individuals ($I$), and recovered individuals ($R$). Initially, at time $t=0$, there are 20 infected individuals and no one has recovered yet. The remaining population is susceptible.\n\nThe dynamics of the epidemic are modeled as follows:\n- The rate at which susceptible people become infected is jointly proportional to the number of susceptible people and the number of infected people.

We are given a description of the dynamics, which we can translate into a system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs).\n\nFirst, let's establish the initial conditions at $t=0$.\nThe total population is $N = 2020$.\nThe initial number of infected individuals is $I(0) = 20$.\nThe initial number of recovered individuals is $R(0) = 0$.\nThe number of susceptible individuals is the remainder of the population, so $S(0) = N - I(0) - R(0) = 2020 - 20 - 0 = 2000$.\n\nThe constants given are:\nEffective transmission rate: $\\alpha = 0.0001 \\text{ (person} \\cdot \\text{day)}^{-1}$\nRecovery rate: $\\gamma = 0.1 \\text{ day}^{-1}$\n\nNow, let's write down the differential equations based on the problem description.\nThe rate of change of the susceptible population, $\\frac{dS}{dt}$, is the rate at which susceptible people become infected. The problem states this is proportional to the product $S \\cdot I$ with constant $\\alpha$. Since the number of susceptible people decreases, this rate is negative.\n$$ \\frac{dS}{dt} = -\\alpha S I $$\n\nThe rate of change of the infected population, $\\frac{dI}{dt}$, has two components. It increases as susceptible people get infected and decreases as infected people recover.\nThe rate of increase is $\\alpha S I$.\nThe rate of decrease (recovery) is proportional to $I$ with constant $\\gamma$, so it's $\\gamma I$.\n$$ \\frac{dI}{dt} = \\alpha S I - \\gamma I $$\n\nThe rate of change of the recovered population, $\\frac{dR}{dt}$, is simply the rate at which infected people recover.\n$$ \\frac{dR}{dt} = \\gamma I $$\n\nWe need to find the values of these rates at $t=0$, which are $S'(0)$, $I'(0)$, and $R'(0)$. We can do this by substituting the initial conditions $S(0)$, $I(0)$, and $R(0)$ into the differential equations.\n\nFor the susceptible population:\n$$ S'(0) = \\frac{dS}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} = -\\alpha S(0) I(0) $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ S'(0) = -(0.0001) \\cdot (2000) \\cdot (20) = -(0.0001) \\cdot (40000) = -4 $$\nSo, the susceptible population is initially decreasing at a rate of 4 people per day.\n\nFor the infected population:\n$$ I'(0) = \\frac{dI}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} = \\alpha S(0) I(0) - \\gamma I(0) $$\nWe have already calculated the first term, $\\alpha S(0) I(0) = 4$.\n$$ I'(0) = 4 - \\gamma I(0) = 4 - (0.1) \\cdot (20) = 4 - 2 = 2 $$\nSo, the infected population is initially increasing at a rate of 2 people per day.\n\nFor the recovered population:\n$$ R'(0) = \\frac{dR}{dt}\\bigg|_{t=0} = \\gamma I(0) $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ R'(0) = (0.1) \\cdot (20) = 2 $$\nSo, the recovered population is initially increasing at a rate of 2 people per day.\n\nThe initial rates of change are $S'(0) = -4$, $I'(0) = 2$, and $R'(0) = 2$, all in units of people per day. As a quick check, note that the total population $N=S+I+R$ is constant, so its rate of change must be zero: $N' = S' + I' + R' = -4 + 2 + 2 = 0$.
