A fundamental requirement for $V(x,y)$ to serve as a proper Lyapunov function is that it must be positive definite in a neighborhood of the equilibrium. A function $V(x,y)$ is said to be positive definite if $V(0,0) = 0$ and $V(x,y)  0$ for all other points $(x,y)$ in a domain around the origin.\n\nConsider the quadratic form $V(x,y) = x^2 + cxy + 2y^2$, where $c$ is a real constant. This function is proposed as a candidate Lyapunov function for a system with an equilibrium at the origin $(0,0)$. The range of values for $c$ for which $V(x,y)$ is positive definite can be expressed as an open interval $(a, b)$.\n\nDetermine the value of the length of this interval, $b-a$.
