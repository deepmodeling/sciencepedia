Let $J = D\\vec{F}(0)$ be the Jacobian matrix at the origin. The linearized system is\n$$\n\\frac{d\\vec{x}}{dt} = J \\vec{x}.\n$$\nBy the Hartman-Grobman theorem, if the origin is hyperbolic for the linearized system (that is, all eigenvalues of $J$ have nonzero real parts), then the nonlinear system is locally topologically conjugate to the linear system, and the qualitative phase portrait near the origin matches that of the linearized system.\n\nFrom observation 1, all trajectories starting sufficiently close to the origin (except the equilibrium itself) satisfy $\\vec{x}(t) \\to \\vec{0}$ as $t \\to \\infty$. For the linearized system, this occurs if and only if all eigenvalues of $J$ have strictly negative real parts. Therefore, the spectrum of $J$ satisfies\n$$\n\\Re(\\lambda_{i})  0 \\quad \\text{for all eigenvalues } \\lambda_{i}.\n$$\nThis establishes that the origin is locally asymptotically stable.\n\nFrom observation 2, there is no rotational or spiraling behavior; trajectories approach directly without rotation. For the linearized system, spiraling corresponds to complex conjugate eigenvalues with nonzero imaginary parts. The absence of spiraling implies that the eigenvalues are real:\n$$\n\\lambda_{1}, \\lambda_{2} \\in \\mathbb{R}.\n$$\n\nFrom observation 3, there are exactly two distinct straight lines $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$ through the origin that are invariant (trajectories starting on them approach the origin along that line). In the linearized system, invariant straight lines through the origin are precisely eigendirections. The existence of two distinct invariant lines implies that $J$ has two linearly independent eigenvectors. Hence $J$ is diagonalizable over $\\mathbb{R}$ with two distinct real eigenvalues:\n$$\n\\lambda_{1} \\neq \\lambda_{2}, \\quad \\lambda_{1}  0, \\ \\lambda_{2}  0.\n$$\n\nThe remaining part of observation 3 says that all other trajectories approach the origin tangent to $L_{1}$. For the linearized system with distinct real negative eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors $\\vec{v}_{1}, \\vec{v}_{2}$, every solution can be written as\n$$\n\\vec{x}(t) = c_{1} \\exp(\\lambda_{1} t) \\vec{v}_{1} + c_{2} \\exp(\\lambda_{2} t) \\vec{v}_{2}.\n$$\nAssume without loss of generality that $\\lambda_{1}  \\lambda_{2}  0$, so that $\\exp(\\lambda_{2} t)$ decays slower than $\\exp(\\lambda_{1} t)$. For generic initial data with $c_{2} \\neq 0$, as $t \\to \\infty$ the term with $\\exp(\\lambda_{2} t)$ dominates, and trajectories approach the origin tangent to the eigendirection $\\vec{v}_{2}$. Thus $L_{1}$ corresponds to the eigendirection associated with the eigenvalue having the larger real part (less negative), which is the standard signature of a stable node.\n\nCombining these facts and invoking the Hartman-Grobman theorem to pass from the linearized portrait to the nonlinear one, the origin is a stable node (asymptotically stable), matching option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2164881"}, {"introduction": "With a solid qualitative foundation, we can now focus on the quantitative analysis of linear systems.
