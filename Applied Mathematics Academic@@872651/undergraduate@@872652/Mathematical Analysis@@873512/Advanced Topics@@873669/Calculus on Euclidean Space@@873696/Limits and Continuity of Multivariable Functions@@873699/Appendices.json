We will evaluate $C(x,y)$ along different paths approaching $(0,0)$ and compare the resulting limits.\n\nFirst, consider the path along the $x$-axis given by $y=0$ with $x \\to 0$.

Because a multivariable limit, if it exists, must be unique and independent of path, these two different values imply that the limit does not exist.\n\nFor completeness, note that a more general family of paths $x = k \\sin(y)$ with constant $k$ gives\n$$\nC(k \\sin(y), y) = \\frac{k \\sin(y)\\, y}{k^{2} \\sin^{2}(y) + \\sin^{2}(y)} = \\frac{k}{k^{2}+1} \\cdot \\frac{y}{\\sin(y)} \\to \\frac{k}{k^{2}+1}\n$$\nas $y \\to 0$, which varies with $k$ and confirms the nonexistence of a unique limit.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is that the limit does not exist.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2306128"}, {"introduction": "Having explored when limits exist and when they do not, we now turn to a constructive application: ensuring continuity. Often, a function's definition creates a \"hole\" or singularity, which we may want to remove to create a well-behaved model.

The function is defined using elementary functions for $y \\neq 0$, and is therefore continuous on that domain. The only points where continuity needs to be explicitly enforced are those on the line $y=0$.\n\nLet $(x_0, 0)$ be an arbitrary point on the x-axis. For $F(x,y)$ to be continuous at $(x_0, 0)$, the limit of $F(x,y)$ as $(x,y)$ approaches $(x_0, 0)$ must exist and be equal to the value of the function at that point, $F(x_0, 0)$.\nBy definition, $F(x_0, 0) = g(x_0)$. The condition for continuity is therefore:\n$$g(x_0) = \\lim_{(x,y) \\to (x_0, 0)} F(x,y)$$\nSince the limit is taken as $(x,y)$ approaches $(x_0, 0)$, we consider points in a neighborhood of $(x_0, 0)$ where $y \\neq 0$. Thus, we need to evaluate the limit of $f(x,y)$:\n$$g(x_0) = \\lim_{(x,y) \\to (x_0, 0)} \\frac{\\exp(xy) - 1}{y}$$\nAs $(x,y) \\to (x_0, 0)$, the numerator $\\exp(xy) - 1 \\to \\exp(0) - 1 = 0$, and the denominator $y \\to 0$.

This is permissible as long as we are not on the y-axis ($x=0$). We can handle the case $x_0=0$ separately or note that the manipulation is valid as a limit.\n$$g(x_0) = \\lim_{(x,y) \\to (x_0, 0)} \\left( x \\cdot \\frac{\\exp(xy) - 1}{xy} \\right)$$\nWe can use the product rule for limits:\n$$g(x_0) = \\left( \\lim_{(x,y) \\to (x_0, 0)} x \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\lim_{(x,y) \\to (x_0, 0)} \\frac{\\exp(xy) - 1}{xy} \\right)$$\nThe first limit is straightforward:\n$$\\lim_{(x,y) \\to (x_0, 0)} x = x_0$$\nFor the second limit, let's introduce a new variable $u = xy$. As $(x,y) \\to (x_0, 0)$, we have $u \\to x_0 \\cdot 0 = 0$. The second limit becomes a standard single-variable limit:\n$$\\lim_{(x,y) \\to (x_0, 0)} \\frac{\\exp(xy) - 1}{xy} = \\lim_{u \\to 0} \\frac{\\exp(u) - 1}{u}$$\nThis is the definition of the derivative of the function $h(u) = \\exp(u)$ at $u=0$. Since $h'(u) = \\exp(u)$, the value of the limit is $h'(0) = \\exp(0) = 1$.\n\nSubstituting these results back, we find the value for $g(x_0)$:\n$$g(x_0) = x_0 \\cdot 1 = x_0$$\nThis result must hold for any arbitrary point $(x_0, 0)$ on the x-axis.
