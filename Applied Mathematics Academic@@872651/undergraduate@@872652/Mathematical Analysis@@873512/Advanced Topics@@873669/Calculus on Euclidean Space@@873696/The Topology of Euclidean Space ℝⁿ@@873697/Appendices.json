A point $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ is a limit point of $S$ if every open ball centered at $p$ contains at least one point of $S$ other than $p$ itself. For a set defined parametrically like $S$, the limit points that are not already in $S$ can be found by examining the behavior of the parametrization at the boundaries of the parameter's domain. The domain for the parameter $t$ is $(0, \\infty)$, so we need to investigate the limits as $t \\to 0^+$ and $t \\to \\infty$.\n\nLet the parametric function be $f(t) = (\\cos(t), \\sin(t), e^{-t})$.\n\nFirst, let's consider the limit as $t$ approaches $0$ from the positive side ($t \\to 0^+$):\n$$ \\lim_{t \\to 0^+} f(t) = \\left( \\lim_{t \\to 0^+} \\cos(t), \\lim_{t \\to 0^+} \\sin(t), \\lim_{t \\to 0^+} e^{-t} \\right) $$\nUsing standard limits, we find:\n$$ \\lim_{t \\to 0^+} \\cos(t) = \\cos(0) = 1 $$\n$$ \\lim_{t \\to 0^+} \\sin(t) = \\sin(0) = 0 $$\n$$ \\lim_{t \\to 0^+} e^{-t} = e^{0} = 1 $$\nSo, as $t \\to 0^+$, the points on the spiral approach the point $p_0 = (1, 0, 1)$. Since the parameter domain is $t  0$, the point $p_0$ is not itself in the set $S$. By definition, $p_0$ is a limit point of $S$.\n\nNext, let's consider the behavior as $t \\to \\infty$:\nAs $t \\to \\infty$, the $z$-component of the curve, $z(t) = e^{-t}$, approaches 0.\nThe $x$ and $y$ components, $x(t) = \\cos(t)$ and $y(t) = \\sin(t)$, do not converge to a single value; they oscillate. For any $t$, we have $x(t)^2 + y(t)^2 = \\cos^2(t) + \\sin^2(t) = 1$. This means that as the curve approaches the $xy$-plane (where $z=0$), it remains at a unit distance from the $z$-axis. The set of points approached by the curve is the unit circle $C = \\{ (x, y, 0) \\mid x^2 + y^2 = 1 \\}$.\n\nTo be more rigorous, we must show that every point on the circle $C$ is a limit point of $S$. Let $p_c = (\\cos(\\theta_0), \\sin(\\theta_0), 0)$ be an arbitrary point on $C$ for some $\\theta_0 \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. We need to show that we can find a sequence of points in $S$ that converges to $p_c$.\nConsider the sequence of parameter values $t_k = \\theta_0 + 2\\pi k$ for integers $k \\ge 1$. As $k \\to \\infty$, we have $t_k \\to \\infty$.\nThe corresponding sequence of points in $S$ is $s_k = f(t_k) = (\\cos(\\theta_0 + 2\\pi k), \\sin(\\theta_0 + 2\\pi k), e^{-(\\theta_0 + 2\\pi k)})$.\nUsing the periodicity of sine and cosine, this simplifies to $s_k = (\\cos(\\theta_0), \\sin(\\theta_0), e^{-(\\theta_0 + 2\\pi k)})$.\nAs $k \\to \\infty$, the exponent $-(\\theta_0 + 2\\pi k) \\to -\\infty$, so $e^{-(\\theta_0 + 2\\pi k)} \\to 0$.\nTherefore, the sequence of points $s_k$ converges to $(\\cos(\\theta_0), \\sin(\\theta_0), 0) = p_c$.\nSince we can construct such a sequence for any point $p_c$ on the circle $C$, the entire circle $C$ is a set of limit points of $S$. Note that no point in $C$ is in $S$, because for any point in $S$, its $z$-coordinate is $e^{-t}  0$, while for points in $C$, the $z$-coordinate is 0.\n\nThe set of all limit points of $S$ is the union of points in $S$ itself (since there are no isolated points) and the limit points we found that are not in $S$.\nThe set of limit points not in $S$ is precisely the union of the point $p_0$ and the circle $C$.\nThe closure $\\bar{S}$ is the union of $S$ and all its limit points.\nTherefore, $\\bar{S} = S \\cup \\{ (1, 0, 1) \\} \\cup C$.\n\nComparing this result with the given options, we find that it matches option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2329875"}, {"introduction": "This exercise challenges our everyday geometric intuition by exploring the boundary of the set of points with rational coordinates, $\\mathbb{Q}^n$.
