Let $m > n$ without loss of generality. The difference between two terms in the sequence is:\n$$ x^{(m)} - x^{(n)} = \\left(0, \\dots, 0, \\frac{1}{n+1}, \\frac{1}{n+2}, \\dots, \\frac{1}{m}, 0, 0, \\dots\\right) $$\nThe supremum norm of this difference is:\n$$ ||x^{(m)} - x^{(n)}||_{\\infty} = \\sup_{k \\ge 1} |(x^{(m)} - x^{(n)})_k| = \\sup\\left\\{\\frac{1}{n+1}, \\frac{1}{n+2}, \\dots, \\frac{1}{m}\\right\\} = \\frac{1}{n+1} $$\nFor any $\\epsilon > 0$, we can choose an integer $N > \\frac{1}{\\epsilon} - 1$. Then for any $m > n > N$, we have $n+1 > N+1 > \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}$, which implies $\\frac{1}{n+1}  \\epsilon$. Therefore, $||x^{(m)} - x^{(n)}||_{\\infty}  \\epsilon$, and the sequence $(x^{(n)})_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ is a Cauchy sequence.\n\nNext, we check for convergence in $c_{00}$. Suppose the sequence converges to a limit $L \\in c_{00}$, i.e., $x^{(n)} \\to L$. Convergence in the supremum norm implies pointwise convergence. This means that for each fixed component $k$, the sequence of real numbers $(x^{(n)}_k)_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ must converge to $L_k$.\nFor a fixed $k$, the sequence of the $k$-th components is $(x^{(1)}_k, x^{(2)}_k, x^{(3)}_k, \\dots)$. By definition of $x^{(n)}$, for any $n \\ge k$, the $k$-th component is $x^{(n)}_k = \\frac{1}{k}$. Thus, the sequence $(x^{(n)}_k)_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ is eventually constant and equal to $\\frac{1}{k}$.\nThe limit is therefore $L_k = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} x^{(n)}_k = \\frac{1}{k}$.\nThis must hold for all $k \\ge 1$. So, the candidate limit is the sequence $L = \\left(1, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\dots, \\frac{1}{k}, \\dots\\right)$.\nThis sequence $L$ has infinitely many non-zero terms. Therefore, it is not an eventually zero sequence, which means $L \\notin c_{00}$. Since the sequence has a pointwise limit that is not in $c_{00}$, it cannot converge to any element within $c_{00}$. Thus, the sequence $(x^{(n)})_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ does not converge in $c_{00}$.\nThis option describes a Cauchy sequence that does not converge in $c_{00}$.\n\n**Analysis of Option B:**\nThe sequence is given by $x^{(n)} = \\left(\\frac{1}{n}, \\frac{1}{n}, \\dots, \\frac{1}{n}, 0, \\dots\\right)$.\nLet's check if this sequence converges. Consider the zero sequence $0 = (0, 0, 0, \\dots)$, which is clearly in $c_{00}$. The distance from $x^{(n)}$ to the zero sequence is:\n$$ ||x^{(n)} - 0||_{\\infty} = ||x^{(n)}||_{\\infty} = \\sup\\left\\{\\left|\\frac{1}{n}\\right|, \\dots, \\left|\\frac{1}{n}\\right|\\right\\} = \\frac{1}{n} $$\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, $||x^{(n)}||_{\\infty} = \\frac{1}{n} \\to 0$. This means the sequence $(x^{(n)})_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ converges to the zero sequence. Since every convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence, this is a Cauchy sequence that converges in $c_{00}$. This is not the correct answer.\n\n**Analysis of Option C:**\nThe sequence is given by $x^{(n)} = (1, 1, \\dots, 1, 0, \\dots)$.\nTo check if it's a Cauchy sequence, let's consider the distance between consecutive terms. Let $n \\ge 1$.\n$$ x^{(n+1)} - x^{(n)} = (0, \\dots, 0, 1, 0, \\dots) = e_{n+1} $$\nThe norm of the difference is:\n$$ ||x^{(n+1)} - x^{(n)}||_{\\infty} = ||e_{n+1}||_{\\infty} = 1 $$\nSince the distance between consecutive terms is always 1, it does not approach 0 as $n \\to \\infty$. So, for $\\epsilon = 1/2$, we can never find an $N$ such that for $m, n > N$, $||x^{(m)} - x^{(n)}||_{\\infty}  1/2$. Therefore, the sequence is not a Cauchy sequence.\n\n**Analysis of Option D:**\nThe sequence is given by $x^{(n)} = \\left(0, \\dots, 0, \\frac{1}{n}, 0, \\dots\\right) = \\frac{1}{n}e_n$.\nLet's check for convergence to the zero sequence $0 = (0, 0, \\dots) \\in c_{00}$.\n$$ ||x^{(n)} - 0||_{\\infty} = ||x^{(n)}||_{\\infty} = \\left|\\frac{1}{n}\\right| = \\frac{1}{n} $$\nAs $n \\to \\infty$, $||x^{(n)}||_{\\infty} = \\frac{1}{n} \\to 0$. So the sequence converges to the zero sequence in $c_{00}$. Since it is convergent, it must also be a Cauchy sequence.
