Also $x^{2}+y^{2}=1$ holds for all $t$. Hence $\\gamma([0,1])\\subset S_{A}$, so $S_{A}$ is path-connected.\n\nSet B: $S_{B}=\\{(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}\\mid xy=1\\}$. This is the hyperbola with two branches in the first and third quadrants. Take $P_{1}=(1,1)$ and $P_{2}=(-1,-1)$, both in $S_{B}$. Suppose there were a continuous path $\\gamma(t)=(x(t),y(t))$ with $\\gamma([0,1])\\subset S_{B}$, $\\gamma(0)=P_{1}$, $\\gamma(1)=P_{2}$. Then for all $t$, $x(t)y(t)=1$, so $x(t)\\neq 0$ for all $t$. The function $x(t)$ is continuous on $[0,1]$ and takes values in $\\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\{0\\}$. Since $x(0)=10$ and $x(1)=-10$, by the intermediate value property for continuous functions, $x$ would have to take the value $0$ at some $t$, a contradiction. Therefore no such path exists between points on different branches; thus $S_{B}$ is not path-connected.\n\nSet C: $S_{C}=\\{(x,y)\\mid y=|x|\\}\\cup\\{(x,y)\\mid y=-|x|\\}$. This union equals the two full lines $y=x$ and $y=-x$, since for $x\\ge 0$, $|x|=x$ gives $y=x$ and $y=-x$, while for $x\\le 0$, $|x|=-x$ gives $y=-x$ and $y=x$.

Suppose $\\gamma(t)=(x(t),y(t))$ is a continuous path in $S_{D}$. Then $x(t)\\in\\{-1,1\\}$ for all $t$. Since $x$ is continuous and $\\{-1,1\\}$ is a discrete set, the image of the connected set $[0,1]$ under $x$ must be connected, hence a singleton. Thus $x$ is constant along the path. Consequently, no continuous path in $S_{D}$ can connect a point with $x=-1$ to a point with $x=1$. Therefore $S_{D}$ is not path-connected.\n\nSet E: $S_{E}=\\{(x,y)\\mid y=\\lfloor x\\rfloor,\\ x\\in[0,3]\\}$. Here $y$ takes only integer values in $\\{0,1,2,3\\}$, with horizontal pieces on $[0,1)$ at $y=0$, on $[1,2)$ at $y=1$, on $[2,3)$ at $y=2$, and the point $(3,3)$. Suppose $\\gamma(t)=(x(t),y(t))$ is a continuous path with image in $S_{E}$. Then for all $t$, $y(t)=\\lfloor x(t)\\rfloor\\in\\{0,1,2,3\\}$. Hence $y$ is an integer-valued continuous function on the connected set $[0,1]$, so $y$ must be constant. Therefore a path cannot connect points lying on different horizontal pieces (for example, one with $y=0$ to one with $y=1$).

This is a question about the path-connectedness of the robot's operational space.

In this case, the straight line segment itself is a valid path, as it lies entirely within the operational space $\\mathbb{R}^N \\setminus \\{Q\\}$.\nCase 2: The point $Q$ lies on the line segment connecting $P_i$ and $P_f$. Since the dimension $N$ is 2 or greater, the space is not restricted to a single line. We can always \"go around\" the point $Q$. To construct an explicit path, we can find a third point $M$ that is in the space $\\mathbb{R}^N \\setminus \\{Q\\}$ but not on the line passing through $P_i$ and $P_f$. Since $N \\ge 2$, such a point $M$ always exists. For example, in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, we can pick a point anywhere off the line. Then, the path can be formed by two straight line segments: one from $P_i$ to $M$, and another from $M$ to $P_f$. The segment from $P_i$ to $M$ does not contain $Q$ (since $M$ is not on the line containing $P_i, P_f, Q$), and the segment from $M$ to $P_f$ also does not contain $Q$. The concatenation of these two segments forms a continuous path from $P_i$ to $P_f$ that avoids $Q$.\nTherefore, for any $N \\ge 2$, the space $\\mathbb{R}^N \\setminus \\{Q\\}$ is path-connected.

The points $P_i = (0, 0)$ and $P_f = (2, 2)$ are collinear with $Q = (1, 1)$, but a path can be constructed that avoids $Q$, for example, by using a semi-circular arc around $Q$.

The points $P_i = (5, 0, 0, 0)$ and $P_f = (-5, 0, 0, 0)$ are collinear with $Q = (1, 0, 0, 0)$, but the four dimensions provide ample room to construct a path around $Q$. A path is guaranteed.\n\n**Scenario C:**\nThe space is $\\mathbb{R}^1 \\setminus \\{0\\}$. This is the real number line with the origin removed. This space can be expressed as the union of two disjoint open sets: $S_1 = (-\\infty, 0)$ and $S_2 = (0, \\infty)$.

The continuous image of a connected set is connected. In $\\mathbb{R}^1$, the connected sets are intervals. The image of the path, $\\gamma([0, 1])$, must therefore be an interval containing its start and end points, $-1$ and $1$. Any interval containing $-1$ and $1$ must also contain the entire segment $[-1, 1]$, including the point $0$.\nThis means that for some $t \\in (0, 1)$, we must have $\\gamma(t) = 0$. However, the point $0$ is the 'no-go' zone and is explicitly excluded from the operational space. This is a contradiction. Therefore, no such continuous path can exist within the space $\\mathbb{R}^1 \\setminus \\{0\\}$.\nIn this scenario, it is not possible for the robot to travel from $P_i = -1$ to $P_f = 1$.
