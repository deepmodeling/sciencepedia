The norm of a linear functional is defined as $\\|f\\| = \\sup_{\\|y\\|=1, y \\in Y} |f(y)|$.\nAn arbitrary vector $y \\in Y$ has the form $y = (t, t)$ for some scalar $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nThe Euclidean norm of such a vector is $\\|y\\|_2 = \\sqrt{t^2 + t^2} = \\sqrt{2t^2} = |t|\\sqrt{2}$.\nThe condition $\\|y\\|_2 = 1$ implies $|t|\\sqrt{2} = 1$, so $|t| = 1/\\sqrt{2}$.\nFor a vector $y = (t, t)$ in $Y$, the functional $f$ is given by $f(y) = f(t, t) = \\sqrt{2}t$.\nThe value of $|f(y)|$ for a unit vector $y \\in Y$ is $|f(y)| = |\\sqrt{2}t| = \\sqrt{2}|t|$.\nSubstituting $|t| = 1/\\sqrt{2}$, we get $|f(y)| = \\sqrt{2} (1/\\sqrt{2}) = 1$.\nTherefore, the norm of the functional $f$ is $\\|f\\| = 1$.\n\nWe are looking for an extension $F: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $\\|F\\| = \\|f\\| = 1$.\nSince $X = \\mathbb{R}^2$ is a Hilbert space, the Riesz Representation Theorem states that any continuous linear functional $F$ on $X$ can be represented by the inner product with a unique vector $a = (a_1, a_2) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$. That is, for any $x=(x_1, x_2) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, the functional can be written as $F(x) = \\langle x, a \\rangle = x_1a_1 + x_2a_2$.\nThe theorem also states that the norm of the functional is equal to the norm of the representing vector: $\\|F\\| = \\|a\\|_2$.\n\nWe have two conditions to determine the components of the vector $a=(a_1, a_2)$:\n1.  **Extension Condition**: For any vector $y \\in Y$, we must have $F(y) = f(y)$.\n    Let $y = (t, t) \\in Y$.\n    $F(y) = F(t, t) = t a_1 + t a_2 = t(a_1 + a_2)$.\n    We are given $f(y) = f(t, t) = \\sqrt{2}t$.\n    Equating the two expressions, we get $t(a_1 + a_2) = \\sqrt{2}t$. This must hold for all $t \\in \\mathbb{R}$, which implies:\n    $a_1 + a_2 = \\sqrt{2}$.\n\n2.  **Norm-Preserving Condition**: We require $\\|F\\| = \\|f\\| = 1$.\n    Since $\\|F\\| = \\|a\\|_2$, we must have $\\|a\\|_2 = 1$.\n    This means $\\sqrt{a_1^2 + a_2^2} = 1$, or simply:\n    $a_1^2 + a_2^2 = 1$.\n\nNow we solve the system of two equations for $a_1$ and $a_2$:\n(i) $a_1 + a_2 = \\sqrt{2}$\n(ii) $a_1^2 + a_2^2 = 1$\n\nFrom equation (i), we can express $a_2$ as $a_2 = \\sqrt{2} - a_1$.\nSubstitute this into equation (ii):\n$a_1^2 + (\\sqrt{2} - a_1)^2 = 1$\n$a_1^2 + (2 - 2\\sqrt{2}a_1 + a_1^2) = 1$\n$2a_1^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}a_1 + 2 = 1$\n$2a_1^2 - 2\\sqrt{2}a_1 + 1 = 0$\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in $a_1$. We can recognize it as a perfect square:\n$(\\sqrt{2}a_1)^2 - 2(\\sqrt{2}a_1)(1) + 1^2 = 0$\n$(\\sqrt{2}a_1 - 1)^2 = 0$\nThis gives a unique solution for $a_1$:\n$\\sqrt{2}a_1 - 1 = 0 \\implies a_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nNow we find $a_2$ using $a_2 = \\sqrt{2} - a_1$:\n$a_2 = \\sqrt{2} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{2-1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nSo, the unique representing vector is $a = (1/\\sqrt{2}, 1/\\sqrt{2})$.\nThe extended functional $F$ is therefore given by $F(x) = \\langle x, a \\rangle$.
