Thus, we need to find $x_0 > 0$ such that $G'(x_0) = 3$.\n\nTo find the derivative of $G(x)$, we apply the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. The theorem states that if a function $F(x)$ is defined by an integral of the form $F(x) = \\int_{a}^{x} f(t) dt$, where $f$ is a continuous function on an interval containing $a$, then the derivative of $F(x)$ with respect to $x$ is $F'(x) = f(x)$.\n\nIn our problem, the function is $G(x)$, the lower limit of integration is a constant $a = -1$, and the integrand is $f(t) = 1 + \\exp(t^2)$.
