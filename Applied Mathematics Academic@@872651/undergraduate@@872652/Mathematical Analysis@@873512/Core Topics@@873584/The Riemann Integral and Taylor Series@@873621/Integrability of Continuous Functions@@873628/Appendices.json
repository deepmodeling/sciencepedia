Express your answer as a fraction.", "solution": "The problem asks for the evaluation of a limit of a sum, which has the form of a Riemann sum. The definition of a definite integral of a function $f(x)$ over an interval $[a, b]$ as the limit of a right-hand Riemann sum is given by:\n$$ \\int_{a}^{b} f(x) \\, dx = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} f(x_k) \\Delta x $$\nwhere $\\Delta x = \\frac{b-a}{n}$ is the width of each subinterval, and $x_k = a + k \\Delta x$ are the right endpoints of the subintervals.\n\nWe are given the limit:\n$$ Q = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{k=1}^{n} \\frac{8k^{2}}{n^{3}} \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{8k^{3}}{n^{3}}} $$\nOur goal is to match the term inside the summation with the general form $f(x_k) \\Delta x$. Let's analyze the argument of the square root and other terms involving $k$ and $n$. The presence of terms like $\\frac{k^3}{n^3} = \\left(\\frac{k}{n}\\right)^3$ suggests that the sample point $x_k$ might be a multiple of $\\frac{k}{n}$.\n\nLet's try to identify a term that could represent $\\Delta x$. A common approach is to factor out a term proportional to $\\frac{1}{n}$. Let's rewrite the summand:\n$$ \\frac{8k^{2}}{n^{3}} \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{8k^{3}}{n^{3}}} = \\left( \\frac{2}{n} \\right) \\left( \\frac{4k^2}{n^2} \\right) \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{8k^3}{n^3}} $$\nThis is not a promising rearrangement. Let's hypothesize that $\\Delta x = \\frac{2}{n}$.\nIf $\\Delta x = \\frac{b-a}{n} = \\frac{2}{n}$, this implies that the width of the integration interval is $b-a = 2$.\n\nWith $\\Delta x = \\frac{2}{n}$, we define the sample points $x_k = a + k \\Delta x = a + k \\frac{2}{n}$. A simple choice for the starting point of the interval is $a=0$. This gives $b=2$ and the sample points become $x_k = \\frac{2k}{n}$.\n\nNow let's check if the remaining part of the summand can be expressed as $f(x_k) = f\\left(\\frac{2k}{n}\\right)$. The remaining part is $\\frac{2}{n} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{4k^2}{n^2} \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{8k^3}{n^3}}\\right)$. We should group this differently. The summand should be $f(x_k)\\Delta x$. So we have:\n$$ \\frac{8k^{2}}{n^{3}} \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{8k^{3}}{n^{3}}} = \\left(\\frac{4k^2}{n^2} \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{8k^3}{n^3}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{2}{n}\\right) $$\nLet's express the first part in terms of $x_k = \\frac{2k}{n}$:\n$$ \\frac{4k^2}{n^2} = \\left(\\frac{2k}{n}\\right)^2 = x_k^2 $$\n$$ \\frac{8k^3}{n^3} = \\left(\\frac{2k}{n}\\right)^3 = x_k^3 $$\nSubstituting these back into the expression, we get:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{4k^2}{n^2}\\right) \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{8k^3}{n^3}} = x_k^2 \\sqrt{1 + x_k^3} $$\nThis expression corresponds to a function $f(x) = x^2 \\sqrt{1 + x^3}$.\n\nSo, we have successfully identified all components:\n- Function: $f(x) = x^2 \\sqrt{1 + x^3}$\n- Interval: $[a, b] = [0, 2]$\n- Subinterval width: $\\Delta x = \\frac{2}{n}$\n- Sample points: $x_k = \\frac{2k}{n}$\n\nThe limit $Q$ can therefore be written as the definite integral:\n$$ Q = \\int_{0}^{2} x^2 \\sqrt{1 + x^3} \\, dx $$\nNow we need to evaluate this integral. We can use the method of u-substitution.\nLet $u = 1 + x^3$.\nThen, the differential is $du = 3x^2 \\, dx$, which implies $x^2 \\, dx = \\frac{1}{3} du$.\n\nWe also need to change the limits of integration from $x$ to $u$:\n- When $x=0$, $u = 1 + 0^3 = 1$.\n- When $x=2$, $u = 1 + 2^3 = 1 + 8 = 9$.\n\nSubstituting $u$, $du$, and the new limits into the integral:\n$$ Q = \\int_{1}^{9} \\sqrt{u} \\left(\\frac{1}{3} du\\right) = \\frac{1}{3} \\int_{1}^{9} u^{1/2} \\, du $$\nNow, we find the antiderivative of $u^{1/2}$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{3} \\left[ \\frac{u^{3/2}}{3/2} \\right]_{1}^{9} = \\frac{1}{3} \\left[ \\frac{2}{3} u^{3/2} \\right]_{1}^{9} = \\frac{2}{9} \\left[ u^{3/2} \\right]_{1}^{9} $$\nFinally, we evaluate the expression at the limits of integration:\n$$ Q = \\frac{2}{9} \\left( 9^{3/2} - 1^{3/2} \\right) $$\nWe know that $9^{3/2} = (\\sqrt{9})^3 = 3^3 = 27$, and $1^{3/2} = 1$.\n$$ Q = \\frac{2}{9} (27 - 1) = \\frac{2}{9} (26) = \\frac{52}{9} $$\nThe exact value of $Q$ is $\\frac{52}{9}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{52}{9}}$$", "id": "1303973"}, {"introduction": "The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus establishes the profound inverse relationship between differentiation and integration.
