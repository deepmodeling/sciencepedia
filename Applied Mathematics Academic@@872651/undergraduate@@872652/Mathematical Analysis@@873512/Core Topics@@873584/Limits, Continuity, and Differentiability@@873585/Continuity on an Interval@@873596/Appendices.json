Suppose, for contradiction, that no $c$ exists with $g(c) = 0$. Because $g$ is continuous on the connected interval $[0, L-d]$, the sign of $g$ must be constant, so either $g(x)  0$ for all $x \\in [0, L-d]$ or $g(x)  0$ for all $x \\in [0, L-d]$.\n- If $g(x)  0$ on $[0, L-d]$, evaluate at $x_{k} = k d$ for $k = 0, 1, \\ldots, n-1$ (note $x_{k} \\in [0, L-d]$ since $x_{n-1} = L-d$).
