The function $f$ is not uniformly continuous on $I$ because it does not satisfy the Mean Value Theorem on any subinterval containing $x=1$.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine if the function $f(x) = (x-1)^{1/3}$ is uniformly continuous on the closed interval $I = [0, 2]$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the function and its domain. The function involves a cube root, which is defined and continuous for all real numbers. The function $g(x) = x-1$ is a polynomial and is continuous everywhere. The function $h(y) = y^{1/3}$ is also continuous everywhere. Since $f(x)$ is a composition of continuous functions, $f(x) = h(g(x))$, it is continuous on its entire domain, $\\mathbb{R}$, and therefore is continuous on the interval $I = [0, 2]$.\n\nThe domain $I = [0, 2]$ is a closed and bounded interval in $\\mathbb{R}$. A fundamental result in real analysis, the Heine-Cantor theorem, states that any continuous function on a compact set is uniformly continuous on that set. In the context of $\\mathbb{R}$, a set is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. Since $I = [0, 2]$ is a closed and bounded set (and thus compact) and $f(x)$ is continuous on $I$, we can directly conclude that $f(x)$ is uniformly continuous on $I = [0, 2]$. This matches the reasoning in option A.\n\nNow, let's analyze the other options to understand why they are incorrect.\n\nFor option B, we consider the derivative of $f(x)$. For $x \\neq 1$, the derivative is:\n$$ f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} (x-1)^{1/3} = \\frac{1}{3}(x-1)^{-2/3} = \\frac{1}{3(x-1)^{2/3}} $$\nAs $x$ approaches $1$, the denominator $(x-1)^{2/3}$ approaches $0$ from the positive side, which means that the derivative $f'(x)$ approaches $+\\infty$. Therefore, the derivative of $f$ is indeed unbounded on the interval $[0, 2]$. However, the statement that an unbounded derivative implies a lack of uniform continuity is false. While a bounded derivative on an interval is a sufficient condition for uniform continuity, it is not a necessary one. This problem serves as a classic counterexample. Thus, option B is incorrect.\n\nFor option C, we note that since the derivative $f'(x)$ is unbounded as $x \\to 1$, the function is not differentiable at $x=1$. The limit of the difference quotient does not exist as a finite number. While it is true that $f$ is not differentiable at $x=1$, this fact alone does not preclude uniform continuity. A simple example is $g(x) = |x|$ on $[-1, 1]$, which is uniformly continuous but not differentiable at $x=0$. Thus, a function does not need to be differentiable everywhere on an interval to be uniformly continuous. So, option C is incorrect.\n\nFor option D, the statement claims that the derivative is bounded. As we calculated above, the derivative is unbounded near $x=1$. Therefore, the premise of this statement is factually incorrect. So, option D is incorrect.\n\nFor option E, the Mean Value Theorem requires the function to be continuous on a closed interval $[a, b]$ and differentiable on the open interval $(a, b)$. Since $f(x)$ is not differentiable at $x=1$, the Mean Value Theorem does not apply to any interval $(a, b)$ that contains $1$. However, this failure to satisfy the hypotheses of the Mean Value Theorem does not have a direct implication on whether the function is uniformly continuous. Uniform continuity is a more fundamental property related to continuity on a compact set. Therefore, option E provides an irrelevant reason and is incorrect.\n\nBased on the Heine-Cantor theorem, the correct reasoning is that $f(x)$ is a continuous function on a compact set, which implies it is uniformly continuous. This corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2331992"}, {"introduction": "The nature of a function's domain is critical in determining uniform continuity. This practice explores this idea by examining the same function, $f(x) = 1/x$, on two different intervals. By contrasting its behavior on a bounded interval approaching a vertical asymptote with its behavior on an unbounded interval stretching to infinity, we can develop a deeper intuition for why the \"uniform\" aspect of continuity may hold or fail.
