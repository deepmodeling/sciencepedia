This exercise provides a direct application of this principle by asking you to determine the structure of a set defined by a polynomial inequality.

A *connected component* of a set $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ is a maximal connected subset of $S$. That is, a non-empty subset $C \\subseteq S$ is a connected component if $C$ is connected, and there is no other connected subset $C' \\subseteq S$ such that $C$ is a proper subset of $C'$. The connected components of any set $S$ form a partition of $S$.\n\nConsider the set $K$ defined as the collection of all real numbers $x$ that satisfy the following inequality:\n$$x^6 - 14x^4 + 49x^2  36$$\nDetermine the number of connected components of the set $K$.", "solution": "We are to determine the number of connected components of the set\n$$\nK=\\{x\\in\\mathbb{R}:x^{6}-14x^{4}+49x^{2}36\\}.\n$$\nIntroduce the substitution $y=x^{2}$, noting that $y\\geq 0$ for all real $x$.
