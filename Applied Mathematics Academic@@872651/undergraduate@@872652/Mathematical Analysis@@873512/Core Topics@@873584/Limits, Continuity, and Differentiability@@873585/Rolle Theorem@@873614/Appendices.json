Rolle's Theorem only requires differentiability on the open interval $(-3, 3)$, a condition which $f(x)$ satisfies.\n\nD. The student's claim is correct, but their reasoning is wrong. The true reason is that no such $c$ exists in $(-3, 3)$ where $f'(c)=0$.", "solution": "To evaluate the student's claim, we must carefully check if the function $f(x) = \\sqrt{9-x^2}$ on the interval $[-3, 3]$ satisfies the three hypotheses of Rolle's Theorem.\n\n1.  **Continuity on the closed interval $[-3, 3]$**:\n    The function $f(x)$ is a composition of a polynomial function, $p(x) = 9-x^2$, and the square root function, $s(y) = \\sqrt{y}$. The polynomial $p(x)$ is continuous everywhere. The square root function $s(y)$ is continuous for all $y \\ge 0$. For $x \\in [-3, 3]$, we have $x^2 \\le 9$, which means $9-x^2 \\ge 0$. Thus, the argument of the square root is always non-negative on the interval $[-3, 3]$. As the composition of continuous functions, $f(x)$ is continuous on the entire closed interval $[-3, 3]$. Therefore, the first condition of Rolle's Theorem is satisfied. This invalidates option B.\n\n2.  **Equality of function values at endpoints**:\n    We evaluate the function at the endpoints $a=-3$ and $b=3$:\n    $f(-3) = \\sqrt{9 - (-3)^2} = \\sqrt{9 - 9} = 0$.\n    $f(3) = \\sqrt{9 - (3)^2} = \\sqrt{9 - 9} = 0$.\n    Since $f(-3) = f(3)$, the second condition of Rolle's Theorem is satisfied. The student correctly noted this in their claim.\n\n3.  **Differentiability on the open interval $(-3, 3)$**:\n    This is the central point of the problem. We find the derivative of $f(x)$ using the chain rule:\n    $$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} (9 - x^2)^{1/2} = \\frac{1}{2}(9 - x^2)^{-1/2} \\cdot (-2x) = \\frac{-x}{\\sqrt{9 - x^2}}$$\n    For the derivative $f'(x)$ to exist, the expression under the square root in the denominator must be strictly positive. That is, we need $9 - x^2  0$. This inequality is equivalent to $x^2  9$, which means $-3  x  3$.\n    Therefore, the derivative $f'(x)$ exists for all $x$ in the open interval $(-3, 3)$. The student's reasoning focuses on the non-differentiability at the endpoints $x=-3$ and $x=3$, where the derivative is undefined. However, Rolle's Theorem explicitly requires differentiability only on the *open* interval $(a, b)$, which in this case is $(-3, 3)$. Since the function is differentiable on $(-3, 3)$, the third condition of Rolle's Theorem is also satisfied.\n\n    The student's claim that the theorem cannot be applied is therefore incorrect. The student has misunderstood the requirements of the theorem, incorrectly believing that differentiability at the endpoints is necessary. This means option A is incorrect and option C is correct.\n\n4.  **Verifying the conclusion of Rolle's Theorem**:\n    Since all three hypotheses are satisfied, Rolle's Theorem guarantees that there exists at least one $c \\in (-3, 3)$ such that $f'(c)=0$. Let's find this value of $c$:\n    $$f'(c) = \\frac{-c}{\\sqrt{9 - c^2}} = 0$$\n    This equation is true if and only if the numerator is zero, so $-c = 0$, which gives $c=0$. The value $c=0$ is indeed in the open interval $(-3, 3)$. This confirms that the conclusion of Rolle's Theorem holds for this function. This directly contradicts option D, which claims no such $c$ exists.\n\nIn summary, the student's claim is incorrect because their reasoning is flawed. They misinterpret the differentiability condition of Rolle's Theorem. The theorem does apply to $f(x)$ on $[-3, 3]$ because all three hypotheses are met. The correct assessment is that the theorem only requires differentiability on the open interval $(-3, 3)$, a condition that the function $f(x)$ fulfills.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2314475"}, {"introduction": "Beyond finding horizontal tangents, one of the most powerful applications of Rolle's Theorem is in determining the exact number of roots an equation possesses.

The solutions to the equation are the roots of $f(x) = 0$. The analysis will be conducted in two parts: first, proving the existence of at least one root, and second, proving the uniqueness of that root.\n\n**Part 1: Existence of a Root**\n\nWe will use the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) to show that at least one root exists. The function $f(x)$ is a sum of an arctangent function and a polynomial function. Both of these are continuous for all real numbers $x \\in (-\\infty, \\infty)$. Therefore, their sum, $f(x)$, is also continuous on $(-\\infty, \\infty)$.\n\nLet's examine the behavior of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches positive and negative infinity.\n\nAs $x \\to \\infty$:\nThe term $x^5$ and $3x$ both go to $\\infty$. The term $2\\arctan(x)$ approaches $2 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\pi$.\n$$ \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} (2\\arctan(x) + x^5 + 3x - \\pi) = \\pi + \\infty + \\infty - \\pi = \\infty $$\n\nAs $x \\to -\\infty$:\nThe term $x^5$ and $3x$ both go to $-\\infty$. The term $2\\arctan(x)$ approaches $2 \\times (-\\frac{\\pi}{2}) = -\\pi$.\n$$ \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} (2\\arctan(x) + x^5 + 3x - \\pi) = -\\pi - \\infty - \\infty - \\pi = -\\infty $$\n\nSince $f(x)$ is continuous and its range spans from $-\\infty$ to $\\infty$, the function must take on every real value. In particular, it must take on the value 0. Therefore, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there must exist at least one real number $c$ such that $f(c) = 0$.\n\n**Part 2: Uniqueness of the Root**\n\nTo prove uniqueness, we will use a proof by contradiction involving Rolle's Theorem. Rolle's Theorem states that if a function $g$ is continuous on a closed interval $[a, b]$, differentiable on the open interval $(a, b)$, and $g(a) = g(b)$, then there exists at least one number $c$ in $(a, b)$ such that $g'(c) = 0$.\n\nLet's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that $f(x)$ has at least two distinct real roots, say $x=a$ and $x=b$, with $a  b$.\nThen, by definition of a root, we have $f(a) = 0$ and $f(b) = 0$. So, $f(a) = f(b)$.\n\nThe function $f(x)$ is continuous on $[a, b]$. We need to check if it's differentiable on $(a, b)$. Let's find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$$ f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} (2\\arctan(x) + x^5 + 3x - \\pi) $$\nUsing standard differentiation rules, we get:\n$$ f'(x) = \\frac{2}{1+x^2} + 5x^4 + 3 $$\nThe derivative $f'(x)$ exists for all real numbers $x$, so $f(x)$ is differentiable on $(-\\infty, \\infty)$, and thus on $(a, b)$.\n\nSince all conditions for Rolle's Theorem are met, there must exist a number $c \\in (a, b)$ such that $f'(c) = 0$.\n\nNow, let's analyze the expression for the derivative, $f'(x) = \\frac{2}{1+x^2} + 5x^4 + 3$.\nWe examine each term for any real number $x$:\n1.  The term $x^4$ is always non-negative, so $5x^4 \\ge 0$.\n2.  The term $x^2$ is always non-negative, so $1+x^2 \\ge 1$. This implies that $0  \\frac{1}{1+x^2} \\le 1$, and therefore $\\frac{2}{1+x^2}$ is always strictly positive.\n3.  The constant term is $3$, which is strictly positive.\n\nCombining these observations, we have:\n$$ f'(x) = \\underbrace{\\frac{2}{1+x^2}}_{0} + \\underbrace{5x^4}_{\\ge 0} + \\underbrace{3}_{0} $$\nThe sum of a strictly positive term, a non-negative term, and another strictly positive term must be strictly positive. Specifically, $f'(x)  0 + 0 + 3 = 3$.\nSo, $f'(x)  3$ for all real $x$.\n\nThis means there is no real number $c$ for which $f'(c) = 0$. This is a direct contradiction to the conclusion from Rolle's Theorem.\nTherefore, our initial assumption that there are at least two distinct real roots must be false. This implies that there can be at most one real root.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nFrom Part 1, we concluded that there is at least one real solution.\nFrom Part 2, we concluded that there is at most one real solution.\n\nCombining these two results, we can definitively say that the equation $2\\arctan(x) + x^5 + 3x = \\pi$ has exactly one real solution.\nThis corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1321239"}, {"introduction": "Sometimes, the most elegant solutions in calculus come from looking at a problem from a different perspective.
