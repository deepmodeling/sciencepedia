The radii are given by the set $\\{r_1, r_2, \\dots, r_N\\}$, which are not all equal.\n\nThe area of a circle with radius $r$ is given by the function $A(r) = \\pi r^2$.\n\nFirst, let's express $A_{avg}$ mathematically. It is the arithmetic mean of the individual areas $A(r_1), A(r_2), \\dots, A(r_N)$.\n$$A_{avg} = \\frac{A(r_1) + A(r_2) + \\dots + A(r_N)}{N} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\pi r_i^2 = \\pi \\left( \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} r_i^2 \\right)$$\n\nNext, let's express $A_{\\bar{r}}$ mathematically. We first find the average radius, $\\bar{r}$:\n$$\\bar{r} = \\frac{r_1 + r_2 + \\dots + r_N}{N} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} r_i$$\nThen, $A_{\\bar{r}}$ is the area of a circle with this average radius:\n$$A_{\\bar{r}} = A(\\bar{r}) = \\pi (\\bar{r})^2 = \\pi \\left( \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} r_i \\right)^2$$\n\nTo compare $A_{avg}$ and $A_{\\bar{r}}$, we can compare the expressions inside the parentheses, as $\\pi$ is a positive constant factor in both. We need to compare $\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} r_i^2$ with $\\left( \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} r_i \\right)^2$.\n\nThis comparison is a direct application of Jensen's inequality. Jensen's inequality relates the value of a convex function of an integral to the integral of the convex function. For a discrete set of points $\\{x_1, \\dots, x_N\\}$ and a convex function $f(x)$, the inequality states:\n$$f\\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i\\right) \\le \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} f(x_i)$$\nThe term on the left is the function evaluated at the average of the inputs, and the term on the right is the average of the function evaluated at each input.\n\nIn our problem, the inputs are the radii $\\{r_1, \\dots, r_N\\}$, and the function that transforms radius to the non-$\\pi$ part of the area is $f(r) = r^2$.\n\nLet's check if $f(r) = r^2$ is a convex function. A function is convex if its second derivative is non-negative.\nThe first derivative is $f'(r) = 2r$.\nThe second derivative is $f''(r) = 2$.\nSince $f''(r) = 2 > 0$ for all $r$, the function $f(r) = r^2$ is strictly convex.\n\nNow we apply Jensen's inequality with $f(r)=r^2$ and the set of radii $\\{r_i\\}$:\n$$f\\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} r_i\\right) \\le \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} f(r_i)$$\nSubstituting $f(r)=r^2$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} r_i\\right)^2 \\le \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} r_i^2$$\n\nNow, let's reintroduce the constant $\\pi$ by multiplying both sides of the inequality by it:\n$$\\pi \\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} r_i\\right)^2 \\le \\pi \\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} r_i^2\\right)$$\nRecognizing our definitions from the beginning, this is:\n$$A_{\\bar{r}} \\le A_{avg}$$\n\nThe final step is to consider the condition for equality. For a strictly convex function like $f(r)=r^2$, equality in Jensen's inequality holds if and only if all the inputs are identical, i.e., $r_1 = r_2 = \\dots = r_N$. However, the problem statement explicitly says that the radii \"are not all equal\". Therefore, the equality does not hold, and the inequality must be strict.\n\nThus, we have:\n$$A_{\\bar{r}}  A_{avg}$$\nThis corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1306351"}, {"introduction": "Moving from a visual context to a probabilistic one, this problem explores a common pitfall in performance analysis. We often talk about 'average' rates, but what does this mean for the time it takes to complete tasks? This exercise uses Jensen's inequality for the convex function $f(x) = 1/x$ to demonstrate a crucial concept: the expected time per job is not the same as the reciprocal of the expected job rate [@problem_id:2304615]. Mastering this helps in correctly interpreting system performance metrics.", "problem": "A distributed computing system processes a large number of independent jobs. The processing rate, denoted by the random variable $R$, represents the number of jobs completed per second. Due to varying network traffic and server load, this rate is not constant. On any given day, $R$ can take one of the values from a set $\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_n\\}$ with corresponding non-zero probabilities $\\{p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n\\}$. All possible rates $r_i$ are strictly positive real numbers, and the variable $R$ is not a constant (i.e., there is more than one possible rate with non-zero probability).\n\nLet's define two key performance metrics:\n1.  The expected time per job, denoted as $T_{avg}$. This is the expected value of the reciprocal of the rate, i.e., $T_{avg} = E[1/R]$.\n2.

This comparison can be made using Jensen's inequality.\n\nJensen's inequality relates the expected value of a function of a random variable to the function of the expected value of that random variable. For a convex function $f$, the inequality states $E[f(X)] \\ge f(E[X])$. For a strictly convex function and a non-constant random variable $X$, the inequality is strict: $E[f(X)] > f(E[X])$.\n\nIn this problem, the random variable is $R$, and the function being applied is $f(x) = 1/x$. The domain of our random variable $R$ consists of strictly positive values $\\{r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_n\\}$, so we consider the function $f(x) = 1/x$ for $x > 0$.\n\nFirst, we must determine the convexity of the function $f(x) = 1/x$ on its domain $x > 0$. We do this by examining its second derivative.\nThe first derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ is:\n$$ f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{1}{x} \\right) = -x^{-2} = -\\frac{1}{x^2} $$\nThe second derivative of $f(x)$ with respect to $x$ is:\n$$ f''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( -x^{-2} \\right) = -(-2)x^{-3} = \\frac{2}{x^3} $$\nSince the rates $r_i$ are all strictly positive, the domain of interest is $x > 0$. On this domain, $x^3 > 0$, and therefore the second derivative $f''(x) = 2/x^3$ is always positive. A positive second derivative over an interval indicates that the function is strictly convex on that interval.\n\nNow we apply Jensen's inequality for a strictly convex function. The problem states that $R$ is not a constant, meaning it takes at least two different values with non-zero probabilities. For a strictly convex function $f$ and a non-constant random variable $R$, Jensen's inequality is a strict inequality:\n$$ E[f(R)] > f(E[R]) $$\nSubstituting our function $f(x)=1/x$ and random variable $R$ into this inequality, we get:\n$$ E\\left[\\frac{1}{R}\\right] > \\frac{1}{E[R]} $$\nThe problem defines $T_{avg} = E[1/R]$ and $T_{at\\_avg\\_R} = 1/E[R]$. Substituting these definitions into our derived inequality gives:\n$$ T_{avg} > T_{at\\_avg\\_R} $$\nThis relationship holds true for any non-constant random variable $R$ that takes positive values, regardless of the specific values of the rates or their probabilities. Therefore, the relationship is general and does not depend on the specifics of the distribution (as long as it's not a constant).\n\nThis corresponds to choice C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2304615"}, {"introduction": "Jensen's inequality is also a remarkably powerful tool for solving optimization problems in geometry.
