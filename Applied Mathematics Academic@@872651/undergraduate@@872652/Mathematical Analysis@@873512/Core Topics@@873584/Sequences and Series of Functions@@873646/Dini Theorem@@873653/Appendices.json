In the context of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$, a set is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded (Heine-Borel theorem). The interval $[0, 1]$ is both closed (it contains its endpoints 0 and 1) and bounded (it is contained within, for example, the interval $[-2, 2]$).

For any non-negative value $f_n(x)$, multiplying by $x$ will result in a smaller or equal value.

The limit is $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} 1^n = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} 1 = 1$.\n    Since the limit exists for every $x \\in [0, 1]$, the sequence does converge pointwise.
