The system monitors a stream of network packets. An alert is triggered if a packet meets both of the following criteria:\n1. The packet originates from an external, non-whitelisted IP address.\n2. The packet's payload contains a signature matching a known malware pattern.\n\nLet `U` be the universal set of all network packets scanned by the system.\nLet `A` be the subset of packets originating from an external, non-whitelisted IP address.\nLet `B` be the subset of packets whose payload contains a known malware signature.\n\nA packet is considered \"high-risk\" if it belongs to the set `A ∩ B`. All other packets are considered \"low-risk\". The set of all low-risk packets is therefore the complement of the high-risk set, `(A ∩ B)ᶜ`.\n\nAn engineer is tasked with configuring a logging rule to record every packet that is classified as \"low-risk\".

A packet is high-risk if it satisfies both conditions. Therefore, the set of high-risk packets is the intersection of `A` and `B`.\n$$S_{\\text{high-risk}} = A \\cap B$$\n\nNext, we identify the true set of \"low-risk\" packets.
