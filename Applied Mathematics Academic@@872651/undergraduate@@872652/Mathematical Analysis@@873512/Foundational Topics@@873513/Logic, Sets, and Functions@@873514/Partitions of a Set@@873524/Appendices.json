None of the three properties are satisfied.", "solution": "We verify each property in turn.\n\nFor property (1), each set in $\\mathcal{C}$ is nonempty. Indeed, $Q_{1}$ contains $(1,1)$, $Q_{2}$ contains $(-1,1)$, $Q_{3}$ contains $(-1,-1)$, $Q_{4}$ contains $(1,-1)$. The semi-axes are nonempty since $A_{x}^{+}$ contains $(1,0)$, $A_{x}^{-}$ contains $(-1,0)$, $A_{y}^{+}$ contains $(0,1)$, $A_{y}^{-}$ contains $(0,-1)$, and $O=\\{(0,0)\\}$ is nonempty. Thus property (1) holds.\n\nFor property (2), we show pairwise disjointness. The quadrants are pairwise disjoint because any point in $Q_{i}$ has fixed signs of $x$ and $y$ that are incompatible with those in any other quadrant. No quadrant contains any point with $x=0$ or $y=0$, so all quadrants are disjoint from all semi-axes and from $O$. Among the semi-axes, any two distinct semi-axes require mutually incompatible equalities and inequalities: for example, $A_{x}^{+}$ requires $y=0$ and $x0$, whereas $A_{y}^{+}$ requires $x=0$ and $y0$, which cannot both hold; similarly $A_{x}^{+}\\cap A_{x}^{-}=\\varnothing$ since $x0$ and $x0$ cannot both hold. Finally, none of the semi-axes contain $(0,0)$ because each requires either $x0$ or $y0$, so they are disjoint from $O$. Hence all sets in $\\mathcal{C}$ are pairwise disjoint, and property (2) holds.\n\nFor property (3), we verify the union equals $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. Let $(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. If $x\\neq 0$ and $y\\neq 0$, then $(x,y)$ lies in exactly one of $Q_{1},Q_{2},Q_{3},Q_{4}$ according to the signs of $x$ and $y$. If $y=0$ and $x\\neq 0$, then $(x,y)$ lies in exactly one of $A_{x}^{+}$ or $A_{x}^{-}$ according to the sign of $x$. If $x=0$ and $y\\neq 0$, then $(x,y)$ lies in exactly one of $A_{y}^{+}$ or $A_{y}^{-}$ according to the sign of $y$. If $x=0$ and $y=0$, then $(x,y)\\in O$. Therefore every $(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ belongs to at least one set in $\\mathcal{C}$, and by the disjointness already shown, to exactly one.

False. Equal derivatives do not imply the same real roots; for example, $p(x)=x$ and $q(x)=x+1$ satisfy $p'\\equiv q'\\equiv 1$ but have different roots.\n\nC. True. As shown, each class is exactly a coset $p+W$ of the subspace $W$ of constant polynomials.\n\nD. False. While all members of $p+W$ with nonconstant $p$ share the same degree as $p$, the class does not contain all polynomials of that degree (e.g., $x^{2}$ and $x^{2}+x$ are both degree $2$ but lie in different classes since their derivatives differ).\n\nE. Not the most accurate description. Although each class has a unique representative with any prescribed constant term (e.g., $1$), this does not describe the structure of the class itself; the structural description is that of a coset of $W$, which is captured by option C.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and complete description is that each equivalence class is a coset of the subspace of constant polynomials.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2310874"}, {"introduction": "The concept of partitions extends powerfully to infinite sets, allowing for elegant and sometimes surprising constructions.
