The system's behavior is governed by a set of logical rules based on three primary conditions, which can be either true (T) or false (F):\n\n- Let $P$ represent the statement: \"An unauthorized biosignature is detected in the clean room.\"\n- Let $Q$ represent the statement: \"The ventilation system initiates a full purge cycle.\"\n- Let $R$ represent the statement: \"All access points to the facility are hermetically sealed.\"\n\nThe core logic of the safety system is built upon two fundamental operational rules:\n- **Rule 1:** If an unauthorized biosignature is detected, then the ventilation system initiates a full purge cycle.\n- **Rule 2:** If the ventilation system initiates a full purge cycle, then all access points to the facility are hermetically sealed.\n\nThe system's integrity relies on a master validation check.
