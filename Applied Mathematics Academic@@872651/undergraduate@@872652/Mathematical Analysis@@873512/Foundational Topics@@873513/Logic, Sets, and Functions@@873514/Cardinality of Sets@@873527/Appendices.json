In this model, the possible locations for atoms are restricted to points $(x, y)$ in a Cartesian plane where both $x$ and $y$ are integers. The set of all such possible locations is denoted by $S = \\mathbb{Z} \\times \\mathbb{Z}$, where $\\mathbb{Z}$ is the set of all integers $\\{..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...\\}$.\n\nTo understand the properties of this infinite lattice, the physicist needs to classify its size. In set theory, the size of a set is referred to as its cardinality. We use the following standard definitions:\n- A set is **finite** if its elements can be counted and the counting process ends.\n- A set is **countably infinite** if a one-to-one correspondence can be established between its elements and the set of natural numbers $\\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, ...\\}$. The cardinality of a countably infinite set is denoted by $\\aleph_0$ (aleph-null).\n- A set is **countable** if it is either finite or countably infinite.\n- A set is **uncountable** if it is not countable. The cardinality of the set of real numbers, $\\mathbb{R}$, is an example of an uncountable cardinality, denoted by $c$ (the continuum).

Define $h$ by\n$$\nh(n)=\n\\begin{cases}\n0,  n=1,\\\\\n\\frac{n}{2},  n \\text{ even},\\\\\n-\\frac{n-1}{2},  n\\ge 3 \\text{ odd}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis enumerates $\\mathbb{Z}$ in the order $0,1,-1,2,-2,3,-3,\\dots$.

For $(a,b)\\in\\mathbb{N}\\times\\mathbb{N}$ set\n$$\n\\pi(a,b)=\\frac{(a+b-2)(a+b-1)}{2}+a.\n$$\nThis works as follows: let $s=a+b$. There are exactly $\\sum_{t=2}^{s-1}(t-1)=\\frac{(s-2)(s-1)}{2}$ pairs with sum less than $s$, and within the block of pairs with sum $s$ (which has $s-1$ elements), we enumerate by increasing $a$ from $1$ to $s-1$, placing $(a,b)$ in position $a$. Hence $\\pi$ assigns to each pair a unique index in $\\mathbb{N}$ and hits every index exactly once; thus $\\pi$ is a bijection.\n\nFinally, combine these bijections to get a bijection $\\Phi:\\mathbb{Z}\\times\\mathbb{Z}\\to\\mathbb{N}$ by\n$$\n\\Phi(x,y)=\\pi\\big(h^{-1}(x),\\,h^{-1}(y)\\big).\n$$\nSince $h^{-1}$ and $\\pi$ are bijections, their composition $\\Phi$ is a bijection.
