The student's argument is presented in four steps below. However, the argument contains a logical flaw.\n\n**The Purported Proof:**\n\n**Step 1: Base Case**\nFor $n=1$, the left-hand side (LHS) of the inequality is $\\sum_{k=1}^1 \\frac{1}{k^2} = \\frac{1}{1^2} = 1$. The right-hand side (RHS) is $2 - \\frac{1}{1} = 1$. Since $1 \\le 1$, the proposition $P(1)$ holds true.\n\n**Step 2: Inductive Hypothesis**\nAssume that for some arbitrary integer $m \\ge 1$, the proposition $P(m)$ is true. That is, we assume $\\sum_{k=1}^m \\frac{1}{k^2} \\le 2 - \\frac{1}{m}$.\n\n**Step 3: Inductive Step**\nWe aim to prove that $P(m+1)$ is true, i.e., $\\sum_{k=1}^{m+1} \\frac{1}{k^2} \\le 2 - \\frac{1}{m+1}$.\nWe begin with the LHS of $P(m+1)$:\nLHS = $\\sum_{k=1}^{m+1} \\frac{1}{k^2} = \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{k^2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{(m+1)^2}$.\nAccording to the inductive hypothesis from Step 2, we can substitute the sum, so we write:\nLHS = $\\left(2 - \\frac{1}{m}\\right) + \\frac{1}{(m+1)^2}$.\nNow, we just need to show that this resulting expression is less than or equal to the RHS of $P(m+1)$:\n$2 - \\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{1}{(m+1)^2} \\le 2 - \\frac{1}{m+1}$.\nSubtracting 2 from both sides gives:\n$-\\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{1}{(m+1)^2} \\le -\\frac{1}{m+1}$.\nRearranging the terms:\n$\\frac{1}{m+1} - \\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{1}{(m+1)^2} \\le 0$.\nFinding a common denominator for the fractions, $m(m+1)^2$:\n$\\frac{m(m+1) - (m+1)^2 + m}{m(m+1)^2} \\le 0$.\n$\\frac{m^2 + m - (m^2 + 2m + 1) + m}{m(m+1)^2} \\le 0$.\n$\\frac{m^2 + m - m^2 - 2m - 1 + m}{m(m+1)^2} \\le 0$.\n$\\frac{-1}{m(m+1)^2} \\le 0$.\nSince $m \\ge 1$, the denominator $m(m+1)^2$ is always positive. Therefore, the expression $\\frac{-1}{m(m+1)^2}$ is always negative, and the inequality is true. This completes the inductive step.\n\n**Step 4: Conclusion**\nSince the base case is true (Step 1) and the inductive step (Step 3) has been successfully shown, we conclude by the principle of mathematical induction that the proposition $P(n)$ is true for all positive integers $n$.\n\nWhich of the following options correctly identifies the fundamental flaw in the student's argument?\n\nA. The arithmetic for the base case in Step 1 is incorrect.\n\nB. The algebraic simplification in Step 3, which leads to the expression $\\frac{-1}{m(m+1)^2}$, is incorrect.\n\nC. The conclusion in Step 4 is logically invalid as a general statement about induction.\n\nD. The inductive hypothesis from Step 2 is applied incorrectly in Step 3.\n\nE.

There is no arithmetic error here.\n\nStep 2 (Inductive hypothesis) assumes for some $m \\ge 1$ that $P(m)$ is true: $\\sum_{k=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{k^{2}} \\le 2 - \\frac{1}{m}$. This hypothesis is correctly stated.\n\nStep 3 (Inductive step) starts with\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{m+1} \\frac{1}{k^{2}} = \\sum_{k=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{k^{2}} + \\frac{1}{(m+1)^{2}}.\n$$\nBy the inductive hypothesis, we only have\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{k^{2}} \\le 2 - \\frac{1}{m},\n$$\nso the correct inequality is\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{m+1} \\frac{1}{k^{2}} \\le \\left(2 - \\frac{1}{m}\\right) + \\frac{1}{(m+1)^{2}},\n$$\nnot an equality.

After this misstep, the student aims to prove\n$$\n2 - \\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{1}{(m+1)^{2}} \\le 2 - \\frac{1}{m+1},\n$$\nwhich is indeed true, since it is equivalent to\n$$\n\\frac{1}{(m+1)^{2}} \\le \\frac{1}{m} - \\frac{1}{m+1} = \\frac{1}{m(m+1)},\n$$\nand because $m(m+1) \\le (m+1)^{2}$ for $m \\ge 1$, we have $\\frac{1}{(m+1)^{2}} \\le \\frac{1}{m(m+1)}$. Alternatively, following the student’s algebra,\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{1}{(m+1)^{2}} \\le -\\frac{1}{m+1}\n\\;\\;\\Longleftrightarrow\\;\\;\n\\frac{1}{m+1} - \\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{1}{(m+1)^{2}} \\le 0,\n$$\nand with common denominator $m(m+1)^{2}$, the numerator is\n$$\nm(m+1) - (m+1)^{2} + m = -1,\n$$\nso\n$$\n\\frac{-1}{m(m+1)^{2}} \\le 0,\n$$\nwhich is true for $m \\ge 1$. Thus the algebra is correct.\n\nStep 4 (Conclusion) would be valid if Step 3 correctly applied the inductive hypothesis.
