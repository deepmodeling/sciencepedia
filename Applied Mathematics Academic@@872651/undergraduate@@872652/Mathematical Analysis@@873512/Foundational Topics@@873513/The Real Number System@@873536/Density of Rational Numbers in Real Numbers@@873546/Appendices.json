By the completeness of $\\mathbb{R}$, $S$ possesses an infimum and a supremum in $\\mathbb{R}$. We now identify them. Clearly, $\\sqrt{6}$ is an upper bound of $S$. If $u\\sqrt{6}$, then by density there exists $q\\in \\mathbb{Q}$ with $\\max\\{\\sqrt{5},u\\}q\\sqrt{6}$, so $u$ cannot be an upper bound. Hence $\\sup S=\\sqrt{6}$.
