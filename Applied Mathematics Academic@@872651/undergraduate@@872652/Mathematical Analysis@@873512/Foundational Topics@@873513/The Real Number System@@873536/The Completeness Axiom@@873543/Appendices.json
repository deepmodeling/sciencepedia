Thus $1$ is an upper bound of $S_{A}$. To show it is the least upper bound, let $\\varepsilon0$. There exists $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$ such that $2^{-n}\\varepsilon$, which implies $1-2^{-n}1-\\varepsilon$. Hence for every $\\varepsilon0$ there is an element of $S_{A}$ within $\\varepsilon$ of $1$ from below, so $\\sup(S_{A})=1$. No element of $S_{A}$ equals $1$, since $2^{-n}0$ for all $n$, so $S_{A}$ has no maximum.

Therefore $\\sup(S_{C})=1$ and $\\max(S_{C})=1$ exists. Hence $S_{C}$ does not meet the requirement.\n\nFor $S_{D}=\\{n^{2}-10\\mid n\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\}$, the set is not bounded above because for any real $u$ one can choose $n\\in\\mathbb{Z}$ with $n^{2}u+10$, which yields $n^{2}-10u$.
