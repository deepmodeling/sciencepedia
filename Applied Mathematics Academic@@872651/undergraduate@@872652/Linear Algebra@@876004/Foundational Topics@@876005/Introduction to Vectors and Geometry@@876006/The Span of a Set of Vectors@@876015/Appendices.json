The rover's movement is controlled by executing two fundamental displacement commands, which correspond to the vectors $\\mathbf{u} = (1, 2)$ and $\\mathbf{v} = (-2, h)$, where $h$ is a configurable real-valued parameter. Any final displacement of the rover from its starting point is achieved by a linear combination of these two vectors; that is, any reachable point can be represented as $c_1\\mathbf{u} + c_2\\mathbf{v}$ for some real scalars $c_1$ and $c_2$.\n\nThere exists a specific value of the parameter $h$ for which the set of all reachable points for the rover is dramatically limited, confining it to a single line through the origin instead of allowing it to access the entire plane. Determine this specific value of $h$.", "solution": "The set of all reachable displacements is the span of $\\mathbf{u}=(1,2)$ and $\\mathbf{v}=(-2,h)$. This span is a line through the origin if and only if the two vectors are linearly dependent, and it is the entire plane $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ if and only if they are linearly independent.\n\nLinear dependence occurs when there exists a scalar $k$ such that $\\mathbf{v}=k\\mathbf{u}$.

This final exercise probes a deeper understanding of these foundational properties. By considering a vector that must remain within a span for *any* value of a parameter $\\beta$, you are challenged to think beyond a single calculation and deduce the structural implications for the vector's components. [@problem_id:1398531] This problem demonstrates that if a parameterized vector $v_0 + \\beta w$ belongs to a subspace for all $\\beta$, then both $v_0$ and $w$ must individually belong to that subspace as well.", "problem": "In the vector space $\\mathbb{R}^4$, consider a subspace $W$ which is the span of the set of vectors $\\{u_1, u_2\\}$, where $u_1 = (1, 0, -1, 2)$ and $u_2 = (0, 1, 2, -3)$.\n\nA vector $v$ in $\\mathbb{R}^4$ is defined in terms of two real-valued parameters, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, as follows:\n$$v = (2+\\beta, -1+\\beta, \\alpha+\\beta, 7-\\beta)$$\nIt is given that the vector $v$ is an element of the subspace $W$ for *any* real value of $\\beta$.\n\nDetermine the numerical value of the constant $\\alpha$.", "solution": "The problem states that the vector $v$ is in the subspace $W = \\text{span}\\{u_1, u_2\\}$ for all real numbers $\\beta$. The vector $v$ can be decomposed into two parts: one that is independent of $\\beta$ and one that is proportional to $\\beta$.\nLet's rewrite $v$ as:\n$$v = (2, -1, \\alpha, 7) + (\\beta, \\beta, \\beta, -\\beta)$$\n$$v = (2, -1, \\alpha, 7) + \\beta(1, 1, 1, -1)$$\nLet's define two vectors, $v_0 = (2, -1, \\alpha, 7)$ and $w = (1, 1, 1, -1)$. Thus, we can express $v$ as $v = v_0 + \\beta w$.\n\nThe condition that $v \\in W$ for all $\\beta \\in \\mathbb{R}$ has a strong implication. Let's consider two distinct values for $\\beta$, say $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$.\nThen, $v_1 = v_0 + \\beta_1 w$ must be in $W$, and $v_2 = v_0 + \\beta_2 w$ must also be in $W$.\nSince $W$ is a subspace, it is closed under vector subtraction. Therefore, the difference $v_1 - v_2$ must also be in $W$.\n$$v_1 - v_2 = (v_0 + \\beta_1 w) - (v_0 + \\beta_2 w) = (\\beta_1 - \\beta_2)w$$\nSince $\\beta_1 \\neq \\beta_2$, the scalar constant $c = \\beta_1 - \\beta_2$ is non-zero. If $cw \\in W$, then because $W$ is closed under scalar multiplication, $w = \\frac{1}{c}(cw)$ must also be in $W$.\n\nSo, the first necessary condition is that the vector $w = (1, 1, 1, -1)$ must belong to the subspace $W$.\nLet's verify this. For $w$ to be in $W$, there must exist scalars $c_1, c_2$ such that $w = c_1 u_1 + c_2 u_2$.\n$$ (1, 1, 1, -1) = c_1(1, 0, -1, 2) + c_2(0, 1, 2, -3) $$\nThis vector equation yields a system of four linear equations:\n1.  $c_1(1) + c_2(0) = 1 \\implies c_1 = 1$\n2.  $c_1(0) + c_2(1) = 1 \\implies c_2 = 1$\n3.  $c_1(-1) + c_2(2) = 1$\n4.  $c_1(2) + c_2(-3) = -1$\n\nSubstituting $c_1 = 1$ and $c_2 = 1$ into equations (3) and (4) to check for consistency:\nFor equation (3): $(1)(-1) + (1)(2) = -1 + 2 = 1$. This is consistent.\nFor equation (4): $(1)(2) + (1)(-3) = 2 - 3 = -1$. This is also consistent.\nSince a consistent solution for $c_1, c_2$ exists, the vector $w$ is indeed in the subspace $W$.\n\nNow, since we know $v = v_0 + \\beta w$ is in $W$, and we have just shown that $w$ (and therefore $\\beta w$) is in $W$, for $v$ to be in $W$, $v_0$ must also be in $W$. This is because if we subtract the vector $\\beta w$ (which is in $W$) from $v$ (which is in $W$), the result $v - \\beta w = v_0$ must also be in the subspace $W$.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the value of $\\alpha$ that makes $v_0 = (2, -1, \\alpha, 7)$ an element of $W$.\nFor $v_0$ to be in $W$, there must exist scalars $d_1, d_2$ such that $v_0 = d_1 u_1 + d_2 u_2$.\n$$ (2, -1, \\alpha, 7) = d_1(1, 0, -1, 2) + d_2(0, 1, 2, -3) $$\nThis gives another system of linear equations:\n1.  $d_1(1) + d_2(0) = 2 \\implies d_1 = 2$\n2.  $d_1(0) + d_2(1) = -1 \\implies d_2 = -1$\n3.  $d_1(-1) + d_2(2) = \\alpha$\n4.  $d_1(2) + d_2(-3) = 7$\n\nWe can use the values of $d_1$ and $d_2$ found from the first two equations to solve for $\\alpha$ using the third equation.\nSubstituting $d_1 = 2$ and $d_2 = -1$ into equation (3):\n$$ \\alpha = (2)(-1) + (-1)(2) = -2 - 2 = -4 $$\nWe can check the consistency of our system with the fourth equation:\n$$ (2)(2) + (-1)(-3) = 4 + 3 = 7 $$\nThis matches the fourth component of $v_0$, so our values for $d_1$ and $d_2$ are correct.\n\nThe value of $\\alpha$ must therefore be $-4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-4}$$", "id": "1398531"}]}
