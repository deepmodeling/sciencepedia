The population levels of the species are represented by a vector $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^6$. For the network to be in a state of stable equilibrium, where resources are perfectly recycled without any external gain or loss, the population levels must satisfy a system of 4 homogeneous linear equations. This system is described by the matrix equation $A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{0}$, where $A$ is the $4 \\times 6$ interaction matrix for the system. A detailed study of the species interactions reveals that the number of linearly independent relationships (constraints) among them is maximized, meaning the rank of matrix $A$ is 4.\n\nDetermine the number of free variables in the solution to this system. This number corresponds to the number of species whose population levels can be chosen independently, from which the populations of all other species in the equilibrium are then determined.", "solution": "We model the system as a linear transformation $T:\\mathbb{R}^{6}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{4}$ given by $T(\\mathbf{x})=A\\mathbf{x}$ with $A$ a $4\\times 6$ matrix.
