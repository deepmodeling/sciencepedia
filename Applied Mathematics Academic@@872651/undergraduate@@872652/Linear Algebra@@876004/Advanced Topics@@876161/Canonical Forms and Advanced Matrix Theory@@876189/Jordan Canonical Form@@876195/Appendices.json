This is block diagonal with two $J_{2}(7)$ blocks, corresponding to $2+2$, so it is valid.\n- D: This matrix has diagonal entries $4$ and $7$. Since the JCF must have all diagonal entries equal to the eigenvalues of $A$ and $p(\\lambda)=(\\lambda-7)^{4}$ allows only $7$ as an eigenvalue, the presence of $4$ is impossible.
