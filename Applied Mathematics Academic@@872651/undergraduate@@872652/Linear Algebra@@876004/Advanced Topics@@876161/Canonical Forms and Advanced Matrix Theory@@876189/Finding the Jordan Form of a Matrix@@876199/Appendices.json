The given matrix $A$ is an upper triangular matrix. For a triangular matrix, the eigenvalues are the entries on its main diagonal.\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-3 & 1 & 5 \\\\\n0 & -3 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThus, the only eigenvalue is $\\lambda = -3$. Since it appears on the diagonal three times, its algebraic multiplicity, denoted $m_a(\\lambda)$, is $3$.\n\nThe structure of the Jordan Normal Form is determined by the sizes and number of Jordan blocks corresponding to this eigenvalue. The number of Jordan blocks for a given eigenvalue is equal to its geometric multiplicity, denoted $m_g(\\lambda)$. The geometric multiplicity is the dimension of the eigenspace associated with the eigenvalue, which is calculated as the nullity of the matrix $(A - \\lambda I)$.\nFor our eigenvalue $\\lambda = -3$, we need to compute the nullity of $(A - (-3)I) = (A + 3I)$.\n\nFirst, let's compute the matrix $(A + 3I)$:\n$$\nA + 3I = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-3 & 1 & 5 \\\\\n0 & -3 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -3\n\\end{pmatrix} + 3 \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-3 & 1 & 5 \\\\\n0 & -3 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -3\n\\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix}\n3 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 3 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 3\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 5 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe geometric multiplicity $m_g(-3)$ is the nullity of this matrix. The nullity can be found using the rank-nullity theorem, which states that for a matrix $M$ of size $n \\times n$, $\\text{rank}(M) + \\text{nullity}(M) = n$. Here, $n=3$.\n\nThe rank of a matrix is the number of linearly independent rows (or columns). The matrix $(A+3I)$ is already in row-echelon form. It has only one non-zero row, which is $(0, 1, 5)$. Therefore, the rank of $(A+3I)$ is $1$.\n\nUsing the rank-nullity theorem:\n$$ \\text{rank}(A+3I) + \\text{nullity}(A+3I) = 3 $$\n$$ 1 + m_g(-3) = 3 $$\n$$ m_g(-3) = 2 $$\nThe geometric multiplicity is $2$. This means that the Jordan Normal Form of $A$ must have exactly two Jordan blocks corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = -3$.\n\nThe sum of the sizes of the Jordan blocks must equal the algebraic multiplicity, which is $3$. We need to find the number of ways to partition the integer $3$ into $2$ positive integer parts. The only possible partition is $3 = 2 + 1$.\nThis tells us that the Jordan Normal Form of $A$ consists of one Jordan block of size $2 \\times 2$ and one Jordan block of size $1 \\times 1$.\n\nA general $k \\times k$ Jordan block for an eigenvalue $\\lambda$ is of the form:\n$$ J_k(\\lambda) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\lambda & 1 & & \\\\\n& \\lambda & \\ddots & \\\\\n& & \\ddots & 1 \\\\\n& & & \\lambda\n\\end{pmatrix} $$\nFor our case, the two blocks are:\nA $2 \\times 2$ block for $\\lambda = -3$: $J_2(-3) = \\begin{pmatrix} -3 & 1 \\\\ 0 & -3 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nA $1 \\times 1$ block for $\\lambda = -3$: $J_1(-3) = \\begin{pmatrix} -3 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe Jordan Normal Form is a block diagonal matrix formed by these blocks. Up to permutation of the blocks, the resulting matrix is:\n$$\nJ = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-3 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -3 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nComparing this with the given options:\n- Option A matches our derived Jordan form.\n- Option B represents a single $3 \\times 3$ Jordan block, which would imply a geometric multiplicity of $1$.\n- Option C represents three $1 \\times 1$ blocks, which would imply a geometric multiplicity of $3$ (meaning the matrix is diagonalizable).\n- Option D is the original matrix $A$, which is not in Jordan form.\n- Option E is not a valid Jordan form because the superdiagonal elements are not structured correctly for a block diagonal matrix of Jordan blocks.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1361981"}, {"introduction": "When the geometric multiplicity of an eigenvalue is less than its algebraic multiplicity, we know there are Jordan blocks of size greater than one, but how do we determine their exact sizes?
