However, since $S$ and $K$ are non-zero, it is possible to construct examples where $M$ is not the zero matrix. For instance, if $n=2$, let $S = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $K = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThen $S \\otimes K = \\begin{pmatrix} K & 0 \\\\ 0 & K \\end{pmatrix}$ and $K \\otimes S = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & S \\\\ -S & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$.
