The eigenvalues of a triangular matrix are its diagonal entries. In this case, all diagonal entries are $\\lambda$. Therefore, $\\lambda$ is the only eigenvalue of $J_k(\\lambda)$.\n\nThe characteristic polynomial of $J_k(\\lambda)$ is given by $p(t) = \\det(J_k(\\lambda) - tI)$.\n$$J_k(\\lambda) - tI = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\lambda-t  1  0  \\dots  0 \\\\\n0  \\lambda-t  1  \\dots  0 \\\\\n\\vdots  \\vdots  \\ddots  \\ddots  \\vdots \\\\\n0  0  \\dots  \\lambda-t  1 \\\\\n0  0  \\dots  0  \\lambda-t\n\\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe determinant of this upper triangular matrix is the product of its diagonal entries.\n$$p(t) = (\\lambda-t)^{k}$$\nThe root of this polynomial is $t=\\lambda$, with multiplicity $k$. Thus, the algebraic multiplicity of the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ is $k$.\n\nStep 2: Determine the geometric multiplicity of the eigenvalue $\\lambda$.\nThe geometric multiplicity of $\\lambda$ is the dimension of the eigenspace corresponding to $\\lambda$. The eigenspace is the null space of the matrix $J_k(\\lambda) - \\lambda I$.\nLet's construct the matrix $A = J_k(\\lambda) - \\lambda I$:\n$$A = J_k(\\lambda) - \\lambda I = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0  1  0  \\dots  0 \\\\\n0  0  1  \\dots  0 \\\\\n\\vdots  \\vdots  \\ddots  \\ddots  \\vdots \\\\\n0  0  \\dots  0  1 \\\\\n0  0  \\dots  0  0\n\\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe geometric multiplicity is the dimension of the null space of $A$, which is given by $\\text{nullity}(A)$. By the rank-nullity theorem, we have:\n$$\\text{rank}(A) + \\text{nullity}(A) = k$$\nwhere $k$ is the number of columns of $A$. So, $\\text{geometric multiplicity} = \\text{nullity}(A) = k - \\text{rank}(A)$.\n\nLet's find the rank of $A$. The rank is the number of linearly independent columns (or rows).\nThe columns of $A$ are $c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_k$.\n$c_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n$c_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = e_1$ (the first standard basis vector)\n$c_3 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = e_2$ (the second standard basis vector)\n...\n$c_k = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = e_{k-1}$ (the $(k-1)$-th standard basis vector)\n\nThe set of columns $\\{c_2, c_3, \\dots, c_k\\}$ is $\\{e_1, e_2, \\dots, e_{k-1}\\}$. This is a set of $k-1$ linearly independent vectors. Since $c_1$ is the zero vector, it does not add to the dimension of the column space. Therefore, the rank of $A$ is $k-1$. This holds for any $k  1$. If $k=1$, $A$ is the $1 \\times 1$ zero matrix, and its rank is 0. Note that the formula $\\text{rank}(A)=k-1$ works for both cases: if $k=1$, rank is $1-1=0$.\n\nNow we can calculate the geometric multiplicity:\n$\\text{geometric multiplicity} = k - \\text{rank}(A) = k - (k-1) = 1$.\nThe geometric multiplicity of the eigenvalue $\\lambda$ is always 1, for any $k \\ge 1$.\n\nStep 3: Apply the condition for diagonalizability.\nA matrix is diagonalizable if and only if the algebraic multiplicity equals the geometric multiplicity for all its eigenvalues. In our case, we have one eigenvalue $\\lambda$.\nAlgebraic Multiplicity = $k$\nGeometric Multiplicity = $1$\nFor $J_k(\\lambda)$ to be diagonalizable, we must have:\n$$k = 1$$\nThis condition is independent of the value of $\\lambda$. It solely depends on the size of the block, $k$.\n\nReviewing the options:\nA. The eigenvalue $\\lambda$ must be equal to 0. (Incorrect, $\\lambda$ can be any complex number).\nB. The size of the block, $k$, must be an even number. (Incorrect, the condition is $k=1$).\nC. The size of the block, $k$, must be equal to 1. (Correct).\nD. All Jordan blocks are diagonalizable by definition, regardless of $k$ or $\\lambda$. (Incorrect, this is only true for $k=1$).\nE. The eigenvalue $\\lambda$ must be a non-zero real number. (Incorrect, $\\lambda$ can be any complex number, including zero).\n\nTherefore, the only necessary and sufficient condition for $J_k(\\lambda)$ to be diagonalizable is that its size $k$ must be 1. A $1 \\times 1$ Jordan block is just the matrix $[\\lambda]$, which is already a diagonal matrix and is therefore trivially diagonalizable.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1369971"}]}
