Left multiplication by an elementary matrix corresponds to performing the associated elementary row operation on the rows of any matrix or on the entries of a column vector.\n\nTo change only the third entry from $3$ to $5$ while leaving the first two entries unchanged, we can use the elementary row operation $R_{3} \\leftarrow R_{3} + 2 R_{1}$, since $3 + 2 \\cdot 1 = 5$.

This practice demonstrates the power of elementary matrices as tools for simplifying other matrices, which is the cornerstone of algorithms like Gaussian elimination. Your task is to construct an elementary matrix that accomplishes a specific goal—introducing a zero at a key position—a fundamental step in solving systems of linear equations or finding a matrix inverse [@problem_id:1360393].", "problem": "In a simplified 2D computer graphics model, linear transformations on a plane are represented by $2 \\times 2$ matrices. An initial, somewhat distorted transformation is given by the matrix\n$$ A = \\begin{pmatrix} 2  1 \\\\ 4  5 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nTo correct this distortion, a programmer decides to apply a pre-transformation known as a horizontal shear. A horizontal shear is an elementary transformation that adds a multiple of the first row to the second row. Any such horizontal shear can be represented by an elementary matrix of the form\n$$ E = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ c  1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nwhere $c$ is a real number.\n\nThe goal is to choose the shear matrix $E$ such that the resulting composite transformation, given by the matrix product $B = EA$, will map any vector on the x-axis to another vector on the x-axis. This is equivalent to requiring that the resulting transformation matrix $B$ maps the basis vector\n$$ \\mathbf{e}_{1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nto a vector whose vertical component is zero.\n\nDetermine the elementary matrix $E$ that accomplishes this task.", "solution": "The problem asks us to find a specific elementary matrix $E$ of the form $E = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ c  1 \\end{pmatrix}$ that, when multiplied with matrix $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 2  1 \\\\ 4  5 \\end{pmatrix}$, produces a new matrix $B = EA$ with a specific property.\n\nThe property is that the transformation $B$ maps any vector on the x-axis to another vector on the x-axis. A standard basis vector for the x-axis is $\\mathbf{e}_{1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. The result of applying the transformation $B$ to $\\mathbf{e}_{1}$ is the vector $B\\mathbf{e}_{1}$. A key property of matrix multiplication is that the product of a matrix and the $i$-th standard basis vector $\\mathbf{e}_{i}$ yields the $i$-th column of that matrix. Therefore, $B\\mathbf{e}_{1}$ is the first column of the matrix $B$.\n\nThe condition that the transformed vector lies on the x-axis means its second (vertical) component must be zero. So, we require the second entry of the first column of matrix $B$ to be zero. This is the entry in the second row and first column of $B$, i.e., $B_{21} = 0$.\n\nFirst, let's compute the product matrix $B = EA$ in terms of the unknown constant $c$.\n$$B = EA = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ c  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2  1 \\\\ 4  5 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nWe perform the matrix multiplication:\n$$B = \\begin{pmatrix} (1)(2) + (0)(4)  (1)(1) + (0)(5) \\\\ (c)(2) + (1)(4)  (c)(1) + (1)(5) \\end{pmatrix}$$\n$$B = \\begin{pmatrix} 2  1 \\\\ 2c + 4  c + 5 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nNow, we apply the condition that the entry in the second row and first column, $B_{21}$, must be zero.
