The initial topology is a complete graph, denoted $K_n$, where every node is directly connected to every other node. To minimize operational costs while maintaining full connectivity, the architect decides to implement a spanning tree structure. A spanning tree is a subgraph that includes all $n$ nodes and is a tree (i.e., it is connected and has no cycles).\n\nThe architect employs a simple, deterministic algorithm to create this spanning tree:\n1. One node is arbitrarily selected and designated as the 'primary hub'. Let's label this node $v_1$.\n2. The remaining $n-1$ nodes are labeled $v_2, v_3, \\dots, v_n$.\n3. An edge is created between the primary hub $v_1$ and every other node $v_i$ for $i=2, 3, \\dots, n$. No other edges are included in the spanning tree.\n\nThe number of direct connections a node has in this new network is called its degree. For the spanning tree constructed using this algorithm, determine the maximum degree found among all $n$ nodes. Express your answer as a formula in terms of $n$.", "solution": "A spanning tree on $n$ vertices must have exactly $n-1$ edges. The algorithm connects the primary hub $v_{1}$ to every other node $v_{i}$ for $i=2,\\dots,n$, creating exactly $n-1$ edges, all incident to $v_{1}$.

As a consistency check, the handshaking lemma gives\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\deg(v_{i}) = (n-1) + (n-1)\\cdot 1 = 2(n-1),\n$$\nwhich is consistent with a graph having $n-1$ edges.

This means every vertex in $H$ is connected to $v$, and thus $H$ is connected.\n- **Acyclicity:** All edges in $E'$ are incident to the central vertex $v$. There are no edges connecting two neighbors of $v$. Therefore, no cycle can exist in $H$. The resulting structure is a star graph centered at $v$, which is a type of tree.\n- **Spanning Property:** A spanning tree of $G$ must contain all vertices of $G$, meaning its vertex set must be $V$. The constructed subgraph $H$ has the vertex set $V' = \\{v\\} \\cup N_G(v)$. This is a subset of $V$. The subgraph $H$ is spanning if and only if $V' = V$, which means every vertex in $G$ is either $v$ or a direct neighbor of $v$.
