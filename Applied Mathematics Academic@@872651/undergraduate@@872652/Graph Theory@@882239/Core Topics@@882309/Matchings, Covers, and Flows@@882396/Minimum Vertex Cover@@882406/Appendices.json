In graph theory, this network topology is known as a complete graph, denoted as $K_n$ for a network of $n$ servers.\n\nTo ensure network security and monitor all traffic, monitoring software must be installed on a subset of these servers. The software installed on a particular server can monitor all communication links connected directly to it. A set of servers chosen to host the software is considered a valid monitoring set if every communication link in the network is monitored by at least one server in the set.\n\nDetermine the minimum number of servers that must have the monitoring software installed to form a valid monitoring set for this network of 8 servers.", "solution": "Model the network as the complete graph $K_{n}$ with $n=8$, whose vertex set $V$ represents servers and edge set $E$ represents communication links. Installing monitoring software on a server corresponds to selecting a vertex that monitors all incident edges. A valid monitoring set is thus a vertex cover: a subset $S \\subseteq V$ such that every edge in $E$ has at least one endpoint in $S$.\n\nWe determine the minimum size of a vertex cover in $K_{n}$. Let $S$ be any vertex cover and let $T = V \\setminus S$ be the set of unselected vertices. If $|T| \\geq 2$, then there exist two distinct vertices $a, b \\in T$. Because the graph is complete, the edge $ab \\in E$ exists. Since neither $a$ nor $b$ is in $S$, the edge $ab$ is not incident to any vertex in $S$, contradicting that $S$ is a vertex cover. Therefore, we must have\n$$\n|T| \\leq 1 \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad |S| \\geq n - 1.\n$$\nThis lower bound is attainable by choosing $S$ to be any set of $n-1$ vertices; with at most one unselected vertex, there is no edge between two unselected vertices, and every edge has at least one endpoint in $S$.
