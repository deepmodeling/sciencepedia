By definition, a connected graph $G$ with $|V(G)|$ odd is factor-critical if and only if for every vertex $v \\in V(G)$ the graph $G-v$ has a perfect matching. A perfect matching can exist only in a graph with an even number of vertices, and in a disconnected graph a perfect matching exists if and only if each connected component has a perfect matching.\n\nOption A: $K_5$. This graph is connected and has $|V(K_5)|=5$ (odd). For any vertex $v$, $K_5-v \\cong K_4$. The complete graph $K_{2k}$ has a perfect matching by pairing vertices arbitrarily, so $K_4$ has a perfect matching. Therefore $K_5$ is factor-critical.\n\nOption B: $C_7$. This graph is connected and has $|V(C_7)|=7$ (odd). For any vertex $v$, $C_7-v$ is the path graph $P_6$. A path graph on an even number of vertices always has a perfect matching. Hence $C_7-v$ has a perfect matching, so $C_7$ is factor-critical.\n\nOption C: Two disjoint copies of $K_3$ with a new vertex $v$ adjacent to exactly one vertex in each triangle. The graph is connected because $v$ joins the two triangles, and it has $3+3+1=7$ vertices (odd). Consider removing the special vertex $v$. Then $G-v$ is the disjoint union $K_3 \\cup K_3$. Each $K_3$ has no perfect matching (it has 3 vertices), and there are no edges between the components. Thus $G-v$ has no perfect matching. Therefore this graph is not factor-critical.\n\nOption D: $W_7$. This graph is connected and has $|V(W_7)|=7$ (odd). If we remove the center, we get $C_6$, which has a perfect matching. If we remove any rim vertex $r$, the remaining rim forms a path on 5 vertices, and the center is adjacent to all 5; match the center to one endpoint of the path and complete the matching along the path by two disjoint edges. Hence $W_7-r$ has a perfect matching for any rim $r$, so $W_7$ is factor-critical.\n\nTherefore, the only option that is connected, has an odd number of vertices, and is not factor-critical is Option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1503670"}, {"introduction": "Now that you have a feel for the definition, let's explore its connection to other important graph properties.

For any vertex $v$, the graph $C_5-v$ is a path on 4 vertices, which has a perfect matching (for instance, the two disjoint edges between consecutive vertices at the ends), so $C_5$ is factor-critical. Thus $C_5$ is not a counterexample.\n\nFor $K_5$, the graph has 5 vertices and is 2-connected. For any vertex $v$, the graph $K_5-v$ is $K_4$, which has a perfect matching. Hence $K_5$ is factor-critical and not a counterexample.\n\nFor $K_{2,3}$, the graph has 5 vertices and its vertex-connectivity equals $\\min\\{2,3\\}=2$, so it is 2-connected. To test factor-criticality, remove a vertex from the part of size $2$, say $a_{1}$. Then $G-a_{1}$ is $K_{1,3}$, a bipartite graph with parts of sizes $1$ and $3$. In any bipartite graph with bipartition $(X,Y)$, a perfect matching can exist only if $|X|=|Y|$, since a perfect matching must saturate both sides. Here $|X|=1$ and $|Y|=3$, so no perfect matching exists in $K_{1,3}$. Therefore $K_{2,3}$ is not factor-critical, and this violates the proposition while maintaining 2-connectedness and an odd number of vertices. Hence $K_{2,3}$ is a counterexample.\n\nFor $W_7$, the graph has 7 vertices and is 2-connected (indeed, wheel graphs with at least 4 rim vertices are at least 3-connected). Removing the center yields $C_6$, which has a perfect matching. Removing any rim vertex yields a graph consisting of the center adjacent to the 5 remaining rim vertices with the rim forming a path on 5 vertices; one can form a perfect matching by matching the center to the middle rim vertex and pairing the remaining rim vertices along the path.

For $G=K_3$ and any $e \\in E(G)$, $G-e$ is the path $P_3$. In $P_3$, removing the middle vertex leaves two isolated vertices, which do not admit a perfect matching.
