Before we can improve a matching, we must first learn to identify the specific structure that makes improvement possible.

Mastering this foundational skill is the first step toward understanding and implementing powerful matching algorithms.", "problem": "A distributed computing network consists of a linear array of $N=100$ processing nodes, labeled sequentially from $v_1$ to $v_{100}$. A node $v_i$ is connected only to nodes $v_{i-1}$ (for $i>1$) and $v_{i+1}$ (for $i100$), forming a path graph $P_{100}$. A set of dedicated high-speed communication links, denoted by $M$, is established between pairs of adjacent nodes. A link exists in $M$ between node $v_i$ and node $v_{i+1}$ if and only if the index $i$ is an even integer. This set of links $M$ constitutes a matching, meaning no node is an endpoint of more than one link in $M$.\n\nFor a given matching, a path is called an *alternating path* if its edges alternately belong to the matching and do not belong to the matching. An *augmenting path* with respect to $M$ is a simple alternating path whose start and end nodes are both \"unmatched\" (i.e., not an endpoint of any edge in $M$).\n\nGiven this specific configuration of nodes and links, determine the length of the longest possible augmenting path. The length of a path is defined as the number of edges it contains.", "solution": "Let the path graph be $P_{100}$ with vertices $v_{1},\\dots,v_{100}$ and edges $(v_{i},v_{i+1})$ for $i=1,\\dots,99$.

The edge $(v_1, v_2)$ has index $i=1$ (odd) and the edge $(v_{99}, v_{100})$ has index $i=99$ (odd), so neither edge belongs to $M$. Since no other edge is incident to $v_1$ or $v_{100}$, both $v_1$ and $v_{100}$ are unmatched.\n\nConsider the simple path\n$$\n\\gamma=(v_{1},v_{2},\\dots,v_{100}).\n$$\nIts length is the number of edges it contains:\n$$\n\\ell(\\gamma)=100-1=99.\n$$\nFor each $i\\in\\{1,\\dots,99\\}$, the edge $(v_{i},v_{i+1})$ belongs to $M$ if and only if $i$ is even. Therefore, as $i$ increases by $1$ along $\\gamma$, the membership of $(v_{i},v_{i+1})$ in $M$ alternates (since parity alternates). The first edge $(v_1, v_2)$ is not in $M$ and the last edge $(v_{99}, v_{100})$ is not in $M$. The endpoints $v_1$ and $v_{100}$ are unmatched. Hence $\\gamma$ is an augmenting path.\n\nNo augmenting path (indeed, no simple path) in $P_{100}$ can have more than $99$ edges, because a simple path in a path graph on $100$ vertices has maximum length $100-1=99$.

By exploring this concept, you develop a more nuanced perspective on optimization in graphs.", "problem": "In graph theory, a **matching** in a graph is a set of edges where no two edges share a common vertex. A matching is called **maximal** if it cannot be extended by adding any other edge available in the graph. In other words, every edge in the graph that is not in the maximal matching has at least one endpoint in common with an edge that is in the matching. A matching is called **maximum** if it is a matching that contains the largest possible number of edges for the given graph.

For a disjoint union of graphs, a matching $M$ in $G$ is maximal if and only if its restriction to each connected component is a maximal matching in that component. The forward direction holds because if $M$ were maximal in $G$ but not maximal in some component, an additional edge from that component could be added to $M$, contradicting maximality. The converse holds because if each component has a maximal matching, then no further edge in any component can be added to $M$, so $M$ is maximal in $G$.\n\nTherefore, the size of the smallest maximal matching in $G$ equals the sum over components of the smallest sizes of maximal matchings in each copy of $P_{4}$.

The remaining edges $(v_{1},v_{2})$ and $(v_{3},v_{4})$ each share a vertex with $(v_{2},v_{3})$, so no additional edge can be added; hence $M$ is maximal.
