What is the maximum number of non-overlapping dominoes that can be placed on the remaining squares of the board?

Initially the board has $32$ white and $32$ black squares. The number of removed squares is\n$$\n|S|=4 \\times 4=16,\n$$\nsince there are $4$ even rows and $4$ odd columns.

The remaining white squares are exactly those with $r$ odd and $c$ even. For each such white square $(r,c)$, place a horizontal domino covering $(r,c-1)$ and $(r,c)$. The neighbor $(r,c-1)$ is black because $(r+c-1)$ is even, it lies on the board since $c \\in \\{2,4,6,8\\}$ implies $c-1 \\in \\{1,3,5,7\\}$, and it was not removed because its row $r$ is odd. The mapping $(r,c) \\mapsto (r,c-1)$ is injective, so these dominoes are disjoint.
