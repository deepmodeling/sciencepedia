The environment is modeled as an $M \\times N$ grid of cells, with coordinates $(r, c)$ where $0 \\le r < M$ and $0 \\le c < N$. Here, $r$ is the row index and $c$ is the column index.\n\nA robot can move from its current cell $(r, c)$ to any adjacent cell: $(r-1, c)$ (up), $(r+1, c)$ (down), $(r, c-1)$ (left), or $(r, c+1)$ (right). Each such move constitutes a single step. The robot must stay within the grid boundaries and cannot enter cells designated as obstacles.\n\nFor a specific test case, the grid dimensions are $M=8$ and $N=8$. The robot starts at cell $(1, 1)$ and must reach the destination at cell $(6, 6)$. The following cells are designated as impassable obstacles: $(1, 3)$, $(2, 3)$, $(3, 3)$, $(4, 3)$, $(4, 1)$, $(4, 2)$, $(4, 4)$, and $(4, 5)$.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of steps required for the robot to travel from the starting cell to the destination cell?\n\nA) 10\n\nB) 11\n\nC) 12\n\nD) 14\n\nE) The destination is unreachable.", "solution": "The robot moves on an $8 \\times 8$ grid from $(1,1)$ to $(6,6)$ with four-neighbor moves and given obstacles. The Manhattan lower bound is\n$$|6-1| + |6-1| = 10,$$\nso any path has length at least $10$. We show that obstacles force at least two extra steps and then exhibit a path of that length.\n\nLet $R,L,D,U$ be the numbers of right, left, down, and up moves, respectively. The net displacements required by start and goal are\n$$R - L = 6 - 1 = 5,\\qquad D - U = 6 - 1 = 5,$$\nso the path length is\n$$R + L + D + U = (R - L) + (D - U) + 2(L + U) = 10 + 2(L + U).$$\nThus, if either $L \\geq 1$ or $U \\geq 1$, the length is at least $12$.\n\nWe now argue that any feasible path must satisfy $L \\geq 1$ or $U \\geq 1$ due to the obstacles. The cells $(1,3),(2,3),(3,3),(4,3)$ block column $3$ from rows $1$ through $4$, so a path cannot cross from columns $\\{0,1,2\\}$ to $\\{4,5,6,7\\}$ within rows $1$ through $4$. Moreover, row $4$ has obstacles at columns $1$ through $5$, so to go from rows $\\leq 3$ to rows $\\geq 5$ the path must pass through $(4,0)$ or $(4,6)$ or $(4,7)$.\n\n- If the path crosses row $4$ at column $0$, then starting from column $1$ it must make at least one left move, so $L \\geq 1$ and the length is at least $12$.\n- If the path crosses row $4$ at column $\\geq 6$ while staying at rows $\\leq 4$, then to get from the left side to the right side it must cross column $3$ at a row where it is not blocked; the only such row above $5$ is row $0$. Hence the path must go up at least once, so $U \\geq 1$ and the length is at least $12$.\n\nTherefore every feasible path has length at least $12$.\n\nThis lower bound is attainable.
