By applying this formula to specific types of graphs, we can derive powerful corollaries about their structure. This first practice explores maximal planar graphs, or triangulations, which are the densest simple planar graphs possible. Understanding their properties is critical in fields like structural engineering, where triangular frameworks provide maximum rigidity, and this problem [@problem_id:1492340] will guide you in determining the precise number of connections required.", "problem": "An architect is designing a structural support frame for a large, single-layer skylight. The design consists of a network of straight steel beams that connect at various joints. The entire frame is to be laid out in a single plane, which means that no two beams are allowed to cross each other except at a designated joint.\n\nTo ensure maximum structural rigidity, the design must be \"fully triangulated.\" This condition implies two things: first, the beams form a connected mesh of triangles, and second, it is impossible to add a new beam between any two existing, non-adjacent joints without it crossing an existing beam.\n\nThe final design specifies a total of 15 distinct joints. How many individual steel beams are required for this skylight frame?", "solution": "Model the frame as a simple, connected planar graph embedded without crossings except at joints (vertices). The “fully triangulated” and “maximal” conditions mean that every face, including the unbounded outer face, is a triangle, and no additional edge can be added without violating planarity. Let $v$ be the number of vertices (joints), $e$ the number of edges (beams), and $f$ the number of faces.\n\nFor any connected planar graph, Euler’s formula holds:\n$$\nv - e + f = 2.\n$$\nBecause the graph is fully triangulated, every face has exactly $3$ edges, and each edge is incident to exactly $2$ faces. Counting edge-face incidences in two ways gives:\n$$\n3f = 2e \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad f = \\frac{2}{3}e.\n$$\nSubstitute $f = \\frac{2}{3}e$ into Euler’s formula:\n$$\nv - e + \\frac{2}{3}e = 2\n\\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad\nv - \\frac{1}{3}e = 2\n\\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad\n\\frac{1}{3}e = v - 2\n\\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad\ne = 3v - 6.\n$$\nWith $v = 15$ joints,\n$$\ne = 3 \\cdot 15 - 6 = 45 - 6 = 39.\n$$\nTherefore, $39$ beams are required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{39}$$", "id": "1492340"}, {"introduction": "While triangulations represent the upper limit of edge density in planar graphs, many real-world networks are sparse by design. Constraints might be imposed to prevent short cycles, which can cause interference in communication networks or instability in other systems. This next exercise [@problem_id:1492335] demonstrates how to adapt the reasoning behind the standard edge-bound corollary to accommodate such constraints. You will learn to derive a new upper bound on the number of edges for a planar graph with a specified minimum cycle length, known as its girth.", "problem": "An engineering team is designing a redundant communication network on a new microchip. The network layout can be modeled as a graph where 10 processing cores are the vertices and the communication links between them are the edges. For the design to be valid, it must satisfy several topological constraints.\n\nFirst, the graph must be **simple**, meaning there is at most one link between any two cores and no link connects a core to itself. Second, the graph must be **connected**, ensuring a communication path exists between any two cores. Third, the graph must be **planar**, as the entire network is fabricated on a flat surface and the links (edges) cannot cross. Finally, to prevent certain types of signal resonance and interference, the design specifications forbid any communication loops involving 3 or 4 cores. In graph-theoretic terms, this means the **girth** of the graph, defined as the length of its shortest cycle, must be at least 5.\n\nGiven these constraints, determine the maximum possible number of communication links the team can include in this network design.", "solution": "Let $G$ be a simple, connected, planar graph with $v$ vertices, $e$ edges, $f$ faces, and girth at least $5$. For a connected planar embedding, Euler’s formula gives\n$$\nv - e + f = 2.\n$$\nIn a simple planar graph where the girth is at least $5$, every face boundary has length at least $5$.

Construct two disjoint $5$-cycles $P$ with vertices $p_{1},\\dots,p_{5}$ and edges $p_{i}p_{i+1}$ (indices modulo $5$), and $Q$ with vertices $q_{1},\\dots,q_{5}$ and edges $q_{i}q_{i+1}$. Add three “cross” edges forming a matching between $P$ and $Q$: $p_{1}q_{1}$, $p_{2}q_{3}$, and $p_{4}q_{5}$. This yields $v=10$ and $e=5+5+3=13$. The graph is connected and simple. There are no triangles because the added cross edges form a matching (no two share an endpoint), and no $4$-cycles because the only adjacent pair among the used $P$-vertices is $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$, while their mates $q_{1}$ and $q_{3}$ are not adjacent in $Q$. The original $5$-cycles in $P$ and $Q$ ensure the girth is exactly $5$. A planar embedding exists by placing one $5$-cycle inside the other and routing the three matching edges without crossings by choosing the cyclic order of $q_{1},q_{3},q_{5}$ to match that of $p_{1},p_{2},p_{4}$.

A simplified model of this problem can be represented using graph theory. Consider a scenario where seven processing cores must be fully interconnected, meaning every core must have a direct communication link (wire) to every other core. This configuration corresponds to a complete graph, denoted $K_n$, which is a simple graph with $n$ vertices where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge.\n\nA drawing of a graph on a plane maps vertices to points and edges to curves connecting the corresponding points. A crossing is a point where two edge-curves intersect, which is not a vertex. The crossing number of a graph $G$, denoted $cr(G)$, is the minimum possible number of crossings over all possible planar drawings of $G$. To minimize signal interference, it is crucial to find a layout with the fewest possible crossings.\n\nYou are given a fundamental result from graph theory: for any simple planar graph (a graph with a crossing number of 0) that has $v$ vertices (with $v \\ge 3$) and $e$ edges, the inequality $e \\le 3v - 6$ must hold.\n\nUsing this information, determine a non-zero lower bound for the crossing number of the graph representing the seven fully interconnected processing cores.", "solution": "Let $K_{7}$ be the complete graph on $v=7$ vertices.
