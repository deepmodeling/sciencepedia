A graph is said to be $k$-colorable if it has a proper vertex coloring that uses at most $k$ colors. The chromatic number of a graph $G$, denoted $\\chi(G)$, is the minimum integer $k$ for which $G$ is $k$-colorable.\n\nThe path graph on $n$ vertices, denoted $P_n$, is a graph with a vertex set $V = \\{v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n\\}$ and an edge set $E = \\{(v_i, v_{i+1}) \\mid 1 \\le i < n\\}$.\n\nThe complement of a simple graph $G=(V, E)$, denoted $\\bar{G}$, is a graph with the same vertex set $V$.

Assign the first color to the first vertex in the list and then, in sequence, assign the same color to every subsequent vertex in the list that is not adjacent to any previously colored vertex in this step.\n4.

Proceed through the list; a vertex can receive $c_{1}$ if it is not adjacent to any vertex already colored $c_{1}$. Vertices $B,C,D,E$ are each adjacent to $A$, so they cannot receive $c_{1}$. Vertex $F$ is not adjacent to $A$, so assign $c_{1}$ to $F$. After this step: $A,F$ have color $c_{1}$.\n- Color $c_{2}$: The next uncolored vertex in the ordered list is $B$. Assign $c_{2}$ to $B$. Proceed through the list; a vertex can receive $c_{2}$ if it is not adjacent to any vertex already colored $c_{2}$ (currently $B$). Vertex $C$ is adjacent to $B$, so it cannot receive $c_{2}$.

The time slots for meetings are identical for both groups, but no individual can be in two meetings at once.
