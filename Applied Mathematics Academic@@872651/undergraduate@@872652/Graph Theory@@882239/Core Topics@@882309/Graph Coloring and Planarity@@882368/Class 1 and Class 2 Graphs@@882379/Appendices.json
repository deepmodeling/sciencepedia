The minimum number of colors required for an edge coloring of a graph $G$ is called its chromatic index, denoted $\\chi'(G)$. Vizing's theorem states that for any simple graph (a graph without loops or multiple edges), the chromatic index is either equal to its maximum vertex degree, $\\Delta(G)$, or is one greater, i.e., $\\Delta(G) \\le \\chi'(G) \\le \\Delta(G) + 1$.\n\nThis theorem leads to a classification of simple graphs:\n- **Class 1**: Graphs for which $\\chi'(G) = \\Delta(G)$.\n- **Class 2**: Graphs for which $\\chi'(G) = \\Delta(G) + 1$.\n\nA graph is called regular if all its vertices have the same degree, and non-regular otherwise.\n\nConsider the following four simple graphs, described by their vertex sets $V$ and edge sets $E$.

For $G_{A}$, compute degrees:\n- $\\deg(1)=3$ from $(1,3),(1,4),(1,5)$,\n- $\\deg(2)=3$ from $(2,3),(2,4),(2,5)$,\n- $\\deg(3)=3$ from $(1,3),(2,3),(3,4)$,\n- $\\deg(4)=3$ from $(1,4),(2,4),(3,4)$,\n- $\\deg(5)=2$ from $(1,5),(2,5)$.\nThus $G_{A}$ is non-regular with $\\Delta(G_{A})=3$. We show $\\chi'(G_{A}) \\neq 3$ by contradiction. Suppose there is a proper $3$-edge-coloring with colors $\\{A,B,C\\}$. At vertex $1$, the three incident edges must receive all three colors; let $c(1,3)=A$, $c(1,4)=B$, and $c(1,5)=C$. At vertex $3$, the edges $(1,3),(2,3),(3,4)$ must have distinct colors. Since $c(1,3)=A$, we must have $\\{c(2,3), c(3,4)\\} = \\{B, C\\}$. Similarly, at vertex $4$, since $c(1,4)=B$, the edges $(2,4)$ and $(3,4)$ must be colored from $\\{A, C\\}$, so $\\{c(2,4), c(3,4)\\} = \\{A, C\\}$. The only color common to both sets for edge $(3,4)$ is $C$, so we must have $c(3,4)=C$. This forces $c(2,3)=B$ (from the constraint at vertex 3) and $c(2,4)=A$ (from the constraint at vertex 4). Now, at vertex 2, the edges $(2,3)$ and $(2,4)$ have colors $B$ and $A$. The third edge, $(2,5)$, must therefore be colored $C$. This creates a conflict at vertex 5, as the adjacent edges $(1,5)$ and $(2,5)$ are now both assigned color $C$. Therefore, no $3$-edge-coloring exists, and $\\chi'(G_{A})=4=\\Delta(G_{A})+1$. Thus, $G_{A}$ is non-regular, has $\\Delta=3$, and is Class 2.\n\nB. For $G_{B}$, degrees are $\\deg(1)=3$, $\\deg(3)=3$, $\\deg(2)=\\deg(4)=\\deg(5)=2$, so non-regular with $\\Delta(G_{B})=3$.

At vertex $3$, the colors used on $(2,3)$ and $(3,4)$ are $B$ and $A$, so the available color is $C$. Assign $c(1,3)=C$. This is a proper $3$-edge-coloring, hence $\\chi'(G_{B})=3=\\Delta(G_{B})$ and $G_{B}$ is Class 1.\n\nC. For $K_{4}$, the graph is regular with degree $3$. For complete graphs, $\\chi'(K_{n})=n-1$ when $n$ is even, so $\\chi'(K_{4})=3=\\Delta(K_{4})$. Thus $G_{C}$ is regular and Class 1, not desired.\n\nD. For $G_{D}$, degrees are $\\deg(1)=\\deg(4)=3$ and $\\deg(2)=\\deg(3)=\\deg(5)=\\deg(6)=2$, so non-regular with $\\Delta(G_{D})=3$. We exhibit a $3$-edge-coloring: on triangle $(1,2,3)$ set\n$$\nc(1,2)=A,\\quad c(2,3)=B,\\quad c(3,1)=C,\n$$\nso at vertex $1$ the available color is $B$.

This problem [@problem_id:1488703] introduces this graph through a fascinating combinatorial construction and challenges you to determine its chromatic index. Proving that the Petersen graph is a Class 2 graph is a classic exercise that demonstrates a powerful proof technique and highlights why this particular graph is a frequent counterexample in graph theory.", "problem": "In a decentralized data processing network, there are 10 server nodes. The network topology is constructed based on a combinatorial rule: the nodes are labeled by the set of all 2-element subsets of the set $\\{a, b, c, d, e\\}$. For example, one node is labeled $\\{a, b\\}$ and another is $\\{c, d\\}$. Two nodes are connected by a direct communication link if and only if their label-sets are disjoint.\n\nEach communication link must be assigned a frequency channel, which can be thought of as a \"color\". To prevent interference, any two links that meet at the same node must be assigned different channels. The minimum number of channels required for a valid assignment across the entire network is known as the network's chromatic index, denoted $\\chi'$.\n\nA fundamental result in graph theory, Vizing's theorem, states that for any simple graph, the chromatic index $\\chi'$ is either $\\Delta$ or $\\Delta+1$, where $\\Delta$ is the maximum number of links connected to any single node.\n\nDetermine the minimum number of channels required for this specific network.", "solution": "Let $V$ be the set of all $2$-element subsets of $\\{a,b,c,d,e\\}$. The number of nodes is $|V|=\\binom{5}{2}=10$. The graph $G$ described is the Kneser graph $KG(5,2)$, which is the famous Petersen graph.\n\nFirst, we determine the maximum degree, $\\Delta(G)$. A vertex, say $\\{a, b\\}$, is connected to any other vertex $\\{x, y\\}$ if their sets are disjoint. The elements $\\{x, y\\}$ must be chosen from the remaining three elements, $\\{c, d, e\\}$. The number of ways to choose a 2-element subset from these three elements is $\\binom{3}{2} = 3$. Therefore, every vertex in the graph has a degree of 3. The graph is 3-regular, so $\\Delta(G) = 3$.\n\nAccording to Vizing's theorem, the chromatic index $\\chi'(G)$ must be either $\\Delta(G) = 3$ or $\\Delta(G) + 1 = 4$.\n\nTo determine which class the graph belongs to, we must check if a 3-edge-coloring is possible. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that $\\chi'(G) = 3$. This would mean that the edge set of the Petersen graph can be partitioned into three perfect matchings (since the graph is 3-regular). A perfect matching in a graph with 10 vertices consists of 5 edges that cover all 10 vertices exactly once.\n\nConsider the subgraph formed by the edges of any two of these color classes, say color 1 and color 2. This subgraph is 2-regular, meaning every vertex has a degree of 2. A 2-regular graph is a disjoint union of cycles. Because the edges in this subgraph are properly colored with just two colors, the colors must alternate along each cycle. This is only possible if all the cycles have an even length.\n\nTherefore, if the Petersen graph were 3-edge-colorable, the union of any two color classes would form a 2-factor (a spanning 2-regular subgraph) consisting entirely of even cycles. The Petersen graph has 10 vertices, so such a 2-factor could be a 10-cycle, or a 6-cycle and a 4-cycle.\n\nHowever, the Petersen graph is well-known for not containing any cycles of length 3 or 4. Its shortest cycle (its girth) is of length 5. Since the graph has no 4-cycles, the only possible 2-factor consisting of even cycles would be a single 10-cycle (a Hamiltonian cycle). But it is also a famous property of the Petersen graph that it is non-Hamiltonian; it does not contain a 10-cycle.\n\nThis leads to a contradiction. The assumption that a 3-edge-coloring exists is false. Therefore, the chromatic index cannot be 3.\n\nBy Vizing's theorem, the only remaining possibility is $\\chi'(G) = \\Delta(G) + 1 = 4$.
