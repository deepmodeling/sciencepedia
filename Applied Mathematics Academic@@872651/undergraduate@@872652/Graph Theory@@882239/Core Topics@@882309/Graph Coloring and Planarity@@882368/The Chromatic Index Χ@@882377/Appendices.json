The edge set $E$ of this graph is constructed as the union of two distinct sets of edges. The first set, $E_{cycle}$, comprises the 8 edges that form an 8-cycle connecting the vertices in their indexed order: $E_{cycle} = \\{(v_0, v_1), (v_1, v_2), (v_2, v_3), (v_3, v_4), (v_4, v_5), (v_5, v_6), (v_6, v_7), (v_7, v_0)\\}$. The second set, $E_{cross}$, comprises 4 edges that connect diametrically opposite vertices on this cycle: $E_{cross} = \\{(v_0, v_4), (v_1, v_5), (v_2, v_6), (v_3, v_7)\\}$.\n\nDetermine the chromatic index, $\\chi'(G)$, of this graph.", "solution": "The chromatic index of a graph $G$, denoted by $\\chi'(G)$, is the minimum number of colors required to color the edges of $G$ such that no two adjacent edges (i.e., edges that share a common vertex) have the same color.\n\nFirst, let's determine the maximum degree, $\\Delta(G)$, of the graph $G$. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it. For any vertex $v_i$ in the graph, it is connected to two neighbors via the cycle edges from the set $E_{cycle}$ (specifically, $v_i$ is connected to $v_{i-1 \\pmod 8}$ and $v_{i+1 \\pmod 8}$). Additionally, each vertex is connected to one other vertex via a cross edge from the set $E_{cross}$. For example, $v_0$ is connected to $v_1$ and $v_7$ (cycle edges) and to $v_4$ (cross edge). Thus, the degree of every vertex is $2+1=3$. A graph where every vertex has the same degree $k$ is called a $k$-regular graph. In this case, $G$ is a 3-regular graph. The maximum degree of the graph is therefore $\\Delta(G) = 3$.\n\nAccording to Vizing's theorem, for any simple graph $G$, the chromatic index $\\chi'(G)$ is bounded by its maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$:\n$$ \\Delta(G) \\le \\chi'(G) \\le \\Delta(G) + 1 $$\nFor our graph, this means $3 \\le \\chi'(G) \\le 3 + 1 = 4$. So, the chromatic index is either 3 or 4. To determine the exact value, we must check if a 3-coloring is possible. If we can find a valid edge coloring with 3 colors, then the chromatic index is 3. If we can prove that no such 3-coloring exists, then the chromatic index must be 4.\n\nLet's attempt to construct an edge coloring using three colors, let's call them $c_1, c_2,$ and $c_3$.\n\nWe can start by coloring the edges of the outer 8-cycle, $E_{cycle}$. Since this is an even cycle, its edges can be colored using only two colors. Let's alternate between $c_1$ and $c_2$.\nLet color$(v_0, v_1) = c_1$.\nSince $(v_1, v_2)$ is adjacent to $(v_0, v_1)$ at vertex $v_1$, it must have a different color. Let color$(v_1, v_2) = c_2$.\nContinuing this alternating pattern around the cycle:\n- color$(v_0, v_1) = c_1$\n- color$(v_1, v_2) = c_2$\n- color$(v_2, v_3) = c_1$\n- color$(v_3, v_4) = c_2$\n- color$(v_4, v_5) = c_1$\n- color$(v_5, v_6) = c_2$\n- color$(v_6, v_7) = c_1$\n- color$(v_7, v_0) = c_2$\n\nWe must check for conflicts. At vertex $v_0$, the incident cycle edges are $(v_7, v_0)$ and $(v_0, v_1)$. We have assigned them colors $c_2$ and $c_1$ respectively, which is valid. By symmetry, the same holds for all vertices, so the 8-cycle is successfully 2-colored.\n\nNow, we need to color the cross edges in $E_{cross}$ using one of the three colors. For each cross edge, we must ensure its color is different from the colors of the four cycle edges it is adjacent to (two at each endpoint). Let's use the third color, $c_3$, for the cross edges.\n\n1.  Edge $(v_0, v_4)$:\n    At vertex $v_0$, the incident cycle edges are $(v_7, v_0)$ with color $c_2$ and $(v_0, v_1)$ with color $c_1$.\n    At vertex $v_4$, the incident cycle edges are $(v_3, v_4)$ with color $c_2$ and $(v_4, v_5)$ with color $c_1$.\n    At both ends, the colors used are $c_1$ and $c_2$. Therefore, we can assign color$(v_0, v_4) = c_3$ without conflict.\n\n2.  Edge $(v_1, v_5)$:\n    At vertex $v_1$, the incident cycle edges are $(v_0, v_1)$ with color $c_1$ and $(v_1, v_2)$ with color $c_2$.\n    At vertex $v_5$, the incident cycle edges are $(v_4, v_5)$ with color $c_1$ and $(v_5, v_6)$ with color $c_2$.\n    At both ends, the colors used are $c_1$ and $c_2$. So, we can assign color$(v_1, v_5) = c_3$.\n\n3.  Edge $(v_2, v_6)$:\n    At vertex $v_2$, the incident cycle edges are $(v_1, v_2)$ with color $c_2$ and $(v_2, v_3)$ with color $c_1$.\n    At vertex $v_6$, the incident cycle edges are $(v_5, v_6)$ with color $c_2$ and $(v_6, v_7)$ with color $c_1$.\n    At both ends, the colors used are $c_1$ and $c_2$. So, we can assign color$(v_2, v_6) = c_3$.\n\n4.  Edge $(v_3, v_7)$:\n    At vertex $v_3$, the incident cycle edges are $(v_2, v_3)$ with color $c_1$ and $(v_3, v_4)$ with color $c_2$.\n    At vertex $v_7$, the incident cycle edges are $(v_6, v_7)$ with color $c_1$ and $(v_7, v_0)$ with color $c_2$.\n    At both ends, the colors used are $c_1$ and $c_2$. So, we can assign color$(v_3, v_7) = c_3$.\n\nWe have successfully assigned a color to every edge in the graph using only three colors, and we have verified that no two adjacent edges share the same color. For any vertex $v_i$, the two cycle edges incident to it have colors $c_1$ and $c_2$, and the cross edge incident to it has color $c_3$. This constitutes a valid 3-coloring of the edges of $G$.\n\nSince a valid 3-coloring exists, the minimum number of colors required is at most 3. From Vizing's theorem, we know the minimum number of colors is at least $\\Delta(G) = 3$.
