Hence $v_{c}$ must receive a color distinct from every color that appears on the rim. Because the rim requires at least three distinct colors, $v_{c}$ cannot use any of those three, so at least a fourth color is necessary.

To manage power consumption, each core must be assigned to one of five available frequency domains, which we can label as colors $\\{C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4, C_5\\}$. A critical constraint is that any two cores connected directly by a data bus must be in different frequency domains. This problem is equivalent to coloring a planar graph.\n\nThe processor has seven cores, labeled $V = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5, v_6, v_7\\}$.

As part of its recursive process, the algorithm has temporarily removed core $v_1$ and has successfully assigned colors to the remaining subgraph of six cores, $G' = G - \\{v_1\\}$, as follows:\n- Core $v_2$ is colored $C_1$.\n- Core $v_3$ is colored $C_3$.\n- Core $v_4$ is colored $C_2$.\n- Core $v_5$ is colored $C_3$.\n- Core $v_6$ is colored $C_4$.\n- Core $v_7$ is colored $C_5$.\n\nThe algorithm now attempts to re-insert core $v_1$ and assign it a color. It finds that all five colors are already used by the neighbors of $v_1$. To resolve this, the algorithm executes a standard recoloring procedure. It considers the two colors $C_1$ and $C_3$. It identifies the connected components of the subgraph induced by all cores colored either $C_1$ or $C_3$. To free up one of these colors, the algorithm will swap the colors (i.e., change all $C_1$'s to $C_3$'s and all $C_3$'s to $C_1$'s) within the component connected to the neighbor of $v_1$ that has the smaller vertex index.
