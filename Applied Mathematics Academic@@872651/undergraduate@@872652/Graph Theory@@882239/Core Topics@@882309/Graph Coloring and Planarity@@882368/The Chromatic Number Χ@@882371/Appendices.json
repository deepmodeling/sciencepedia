There is one central steering committee and six specialized sub-committees focused on different areas: Academics, Finance, Infrastructure, Student Life, Research, and Community Outreach. For effective coordination, the following meeting constraints must be observed:\n\n1.  The central steering committee must meet individually with each of the six sub-committees.\n2.  The sub-committees have a circular dependency for resource allocation. The Academics committee must coordinate with both the Community Outreach and the Finance committees. The Finance committee must coordinate with the Academics and Infrastructure committees. The Infrastructure committee must coordinate with the Finance and Student Life committees. The Student Life committee must coordinate with the Infrastructure and Research committees. The Research committee must coordinate with the Student Life and Community Outreach committees. Finally, the Community Outreach committee must coordinate with the Research and Academics committees.\n\nMeetings are to be scheduled into discrete, non-overlapping time slots. If two committees need to coordinate or meet with each other, they cannot be scheduled in the same time slot. What is the minimum number of time slots required to schedule all seven committee meetings according to these constraints?", "solution": "Model the situation as a graph $G=(V,E)$, where each vertex in $V$ is a committee and an edge in $E$ connects two committees that cannot meet in the same time slot. Let $V=\\{S,A,F,I,L,R,C\\}$ denote the central steering committee $S$ and the six sub-committees: Academics $A$, Finance $F$, Infrastructure $I$, Student Life $L$, Research $R$, and Community Outreach $C$. The constraints imply:\n1) $S$ is adjacent to each of $A,F,I,L,R,C$.\n2) The sub-committees form a $6$-cycle: $(A,F)$, $(F,I)$, $(I,L)$, $(L,R)$, $(R,C)$, $(C,A)$.\n\nThus $G$ is the wheel on $7$ vertices with rim $C_{6}$. Minimizing time slots is equivalent to finding the chromatic number $\\chi(G)$, the minimum $k$ for which there exists a proper vertex coloring $f:V\\to\\{1,\\dots,k\\}$ with $f(u)\\neq f(v)$ whenever $(u,v)\\in E$.\n\nFirst, color the rim $C_{6}$. Since $C_{6}$ is an even cycle, it is bipartite, hence $\\chi(C_{6})=2$. Therefore we can color the six sub-committees alternately with two colors, say assign color $1$ to $A,I,R$ and color $2$ to $F,L,C$. The hub $S$ is adjacent to all six rim vertices, which collectively use both colors $1$ and $2$, so $S$ cannot use either of those colors. Assign a third color, say color $3$, to $S$. This yields a proper $3$-coloring of $G$, so $\\chi(G)\\leq 3$.\n\nTo show that fewer than three colors are impossible, suppose $\\chi(G)\\leq 2$. Then the rim $C_{6}$ can indeed be colored with two colors, using both colors among the neighbors of $S$. Since $S$ is adjacent to all six rim vertices, $S$ would have to avoid both colors simultaneously, which is impossible with only two colors. Hence $\\chi(G)\\geq 3$.\n\nCombining the bounds gives $\\chi(G)=3$. Therefore, the minimum number of time slots required is $3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "1405225"}, {"introduction": "While knowing the chromatic number is useful, finding it is often computationally difficult. A common approach is to use a heuristic like the greedy algorithm, which assigns colors sequentially. This exercise demonstrates a crucial aspect of such algorithms: their outcome can depend heavily on the order in which vertices are processed. By comparing two different orderings for the same set of tasks, you will see how a simple change in strategy can lead to a different number of required 'colors' or time slots.

The minimum number of time slots equals the chromatic number $\\chi(G)$ of the interference graph $G$ on the vertex set $V=\\{p_{1},p_{2},u_{1},u_{2},w,s_{1},s_{2},s_{3},s_{4},s_{5},z\\}$.\n\nFirst, identify the core subgraph on $C=\\{p_{1},p_{2},u_{1},u_{2},w\\}$: the given interference pairs $(p_{1},p_{2})$, $(p_{2},u_{1})$, $(u_{1},w)$, $(w,u_{2})$, $(u_{2},p_{1})$ form a $5$-cycle $C_{5}$. It is a standard result that an odd cycle is not bipartite and satisfies $\\chi(C_{2k+1})=3$, hence $\\chi(G)\\geq 3$.\n\nNext, we show that $3$ colors do not suffice for $G$ by contradiction. Let's assume a 3-coloring with colors $\\{a,b,c\\}$ is possible. For the core $C_5$, one possible valid coloring of the vertices $(p_1,p_2,u_1,w,u_2)$ is $(a,b,c,a,b)$, respectively. Now we check the constraints on the secondary vertices:\n- $s_{1}$ (for $c_1=p_1$) is adjacent to $p_{2}(b)$ and $u_{2}(b)$, so its color cannot be $b$. We can set $c(s_1)=a$.\n- $s_{2}$ (for $c_2=p_2$) is adjacent to $p_{1}(a)$ and $u_{1}(c)$, so its color must be $b$.\n- $s_{3}$ (for $c_3=u_1$) is adjacent to $p_{2}(b)$ and $w(a)$, so its color must be $c$.\n- $s_{4}$ (for $c_4=u_2$) is adjacent to $w(a)$ and $p_{1}(a)$, so its color cannot be $a$. We can set $c(s_4)=b$.\n- $s_{5}$ (for $c_5=w$) is adjacent to $u_{1}(c)$ and $u_{2}(b)$, so its color must be $a$.\n\nThus, the secondary set $S=\\{s_{1},\\dots,s_{5}\\}$ must necessarily use all three colors $a, b, c$ (as shown by $s_5=a, s_2=b, s_3=c$). The master vertex $z$ is adjacent to every vertex in $S$. For a proper coloring, $z$ must have a color different from all colors used on $S$. Since $S$ uses all three available colors, $z$ requires a fourth color. This contradicts the possibility of a 3-coloring.

This is a valid partial coloring as there are no edges within $S$, and each $s_i$ avoids the colors of its neighbors in $C$.\n- Color the master vertex $z$: Since $z$ is adjacent to all of $S$ (which use colors $a,b,c$), we assign it the fourth color, $c(z)=d$.\nThis is a proper 4-coloring of the entire graph.\n\nCombining the lower and upper bounds, $\\chi(G)=4$.
