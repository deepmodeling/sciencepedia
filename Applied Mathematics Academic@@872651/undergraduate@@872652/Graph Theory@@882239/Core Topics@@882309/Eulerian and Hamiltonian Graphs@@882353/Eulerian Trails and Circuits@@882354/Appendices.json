The design mandates that the network topology must form a *simple graph*, meaning there are no self-loops on any node and no more than one connection (edge) between any two distinct nodes. Furthermore, the design specifies that every node must have a direct connection to exactly 3 other nodes; this is known as a 3-regular graph.\n\nA diagnostic routine is planned which must traverse every single connection in the network exactly once, starting from an arbitrary node and finishing at that same starting node. Such a traversal is called an Eulerian circuit.\n\nBased on the given design specifications for any such 6-node, 3-regular network, which of the following statements about the existence of an Eulerian circuit is correct?\n\nA. An Eulerian circuit is guaranteed to exist regardless of the specific connection layout, as long as the graph is connected.\n\nB.
