The network architecture is modeled as a simple graph, where each data center is a vertex and a direct, high-bandwidth communication link between any two centers is an edge. To ensure robust data routing, the administrator requires that the network contains a Hamiltonian cycle—a closed loop that passes through every single data center exactly once before returning to the start.\n\nTo achieve this, the design must conform to the condition specified in Dirac's theorem. This theorem states that a simple graph with $n$ vertices (for $n \\geq 3$) is guaranteed to have a Hamiltonian cycle if the minimum degree of any vertex in the graph is at least $n/2$.\n\nAssuming the administrator implements a network that just meets this minimum degree requirement for every vertex to guarantee a Hamiltonian cycle, what is the minimum total number of communication links required for the entire network?", "solution": "Let $n$ be the number of vertices and $m$ the number of edges.

The analyst is correct. Since $n = 2k+1$, the condition for Dirac's theorem is $\\delta(G) \\ge n/2 = k+0.5$. As the degree must be an integer, this is equivalent to $\\delta(G) \\ge k$, which the design rule guarantees.\n\nB. The analyst is correct.

Since $(n-1)/2 = ((2k+1)-1)/2 = k$, the condition is perfectly satisfied.\n\nC. The analyst is incorrect. Dirac's theorem requires the minimum degree $\\delta(G)$ to be at least $n/2$. For $n=2k+1$, this means $\\delta(G) \\ge k+0.5$. Since the degree of a vertex must be an integer, the actual requirement to apply the theorem is $\\delta(G) \\ge k+1$, which is not guaranteed by the design rule's condition of $\\delta(G) \\ge k$.\n\nD. The analyst is incorrect. Dirac's theorem is only a sufficient condition, not a necessary one. This means that even if the minimum degree condition were met, the existence of a Hamiltonian cycle would not be guaranteed.\n\nE. The analyst is incorrect.

Choose a subset $T \\subset C$ with $|T|=k-1$, and let $S$ be an independent set of $k-1$ vertices. Join every vertex of $S$ to every vertex of $T$ and to no vertex of $C \\setminus T$.

The graph is non-Hamiltonian because it is not 1-tough. Let's consider the set of vertices $T$ as a cut set. $|T|=k-1$. Removing $T$ from the graph disconnects the $k-1$ vertices of $S$ (which become isolated vertices) from the 2 vertices of $C \\setminus T$ (which also become isolated from $S$). The removal of $T$ results in $k-1+2 = k+1$ connected components (each being a single vertex). Since the number of components, $c(G-T) = k+1$, is greater than the size of the cut set, $|T|=k-1$ (for all $k \\ge 2$), the graph is not 1-tough and therefore cannot be Hamiltonian.\n\nIts number of edges is the sum of edges inside $C$ and between $S$ and $T$:\n$$\ne=\\binom{k+1}{2}+(k-1)^{2}.\n$$\n\nUpper bound.
