This first practice problem [@problem_id:1489019] serves as a conceptual check, asking you to determine if circuits can exist at all within a very common and simple structure: the star graph. By reasoning through the possible paths in this type of graph, you will reinforce the core requirements for a path to be considered a circuit.", "problem": "In graph theory, a **star graph**, denoted as $K_{1,n}$, is a simple graph with $n+1$ vertices. One vertex is designated as the \"center,\" which is connected to the other $n$ \"leaf\" vertices. The leaf vertices are not connected to each other. This structure implies there are exactly $n$ edges, each connecting the center to one of the leaves.\n\nA **circuit** (also known as a simple cycle) is defined as a path within a graph that starts and ends at the same vertex. A circuit must contain at least three distinct vertices, and no vertices are repeated except for the starting and ending vertex. The length of a circuit is the number of edges it comprises.\n\nConsider a star graph $K_{1,n}$ for any integer $n \\ge 2$.

In $K_{1,n}$, every edge is incident to $c$, so any circuit, if it exists, must include $c$. Suppose a circuit starts at $c$. Its first step must go to some leaf $v_{i}$. From $v_{i}$, the only available neighbor is $c$, because leaves are not adjacent to each other. Returning immediately to $c$ would create the closed walk $c\\to v_{i}\\to c$ of length $2$, which is not a circuit since a circuit must contain at least three distinct vertices and simple graphs admit no $2$-cycles. There is no way to proceed from $v_{i}$ to a different vertex without repeating $c$, so no circuit of length $\\ge 3$ can be formed.\n\nEquivalently, $K_{1,n}$ is a tree (it has $n+1$ vertices and $n$ edges and is connected), and trees contain no cycles.

In this network design, a dedicated, high-speed connection exists between every pair of distinct servers. In the language of graph theory, this network topology is modeled as a complete graph $K_n$, where servers are vertices and connections are edges.\n\nFor network analysis, the engineers are interested in identifying the number of fundamental \"feedback loops.\" A feedback loop is defined as a **circuit**, which is a path through the network that starts and ends at the same server, contains at least one connection, and does not use the same connection more than once. The number of connections in a circuit defines its **length**. The most elementary type of feedback loop is a circuit of length 3, which the engineers call a \"triangular loop.\"\n\nTwo circuits are considered **distinct** if they are composed of a different set of connections. For instance, a loop traversing servers A-B-C-A is considered the same as the loop C-B-A-C, as both are formed by the exact same three connections: (A,B), (B,C), and (C,A).\n\nDerive a general closed-form analytic expression for the total number of distinct triangular loops in the network as a function of the number of servers, $n$.", "solution": "In a complete graph $K_{n}$ with $n \\geq 3$, any set of three distinct vertices induces exactly one triangle because all three pairwise edges among them are present. Conversely, any triangular loop uses exactly three vertices. The problem’s notion of distinctness identifies circuits that differ only by starting point or direction as the same, so each triangle corresponds bijectively to a $3$-element subset of the $n$ vertices.

By considering a complete bipartite graph $K_{m,n}$, you must adapt your counting strategy to account for the fact that edges only exist between two distinct sets of vertices. This challenge highlights how a graph's underlying structure dictates the types and lengths of circuits it can support, providing deeper insight into the interplay between local and global graph properties.", "problem": "In the analysis of network architectures, a fundamental structure is the complete bipartite graph. A graph $G=(V, E)$ is called bipartite if its vertex set $V$ can be partitioned into two disjoint subsets, let's call them $U$ and $W$, such that every edge in the graph connects a vertex in $U$ to one in $W$. The graph is a complete bipartite graph, denoted $K_{m,n}$, if $|U|=m$, $|W|=n$, and for every pair of vertices $u \\in U$ and $w \\in W$, there is an edge connecting them.\n\nA common task in network reliability and information flow analysis is to count specific substructures. One such substructure is a circuit. A $k$-circuit is a path of length $k$ that starts and ends at the same vertex and does not repeat any other vertices. Two circuits are considered distinct if they do not consist of the same set of edges.\n\nConsider a complete bipartite graph $K_{m,n}$ with vertex partitions of size $m$ and $n$, where $m \\geq 2$ and $n \\geq 2$.

For any such choice, since the graph is complete bipartite, all four cross edges between these vertices are present, and the induced subgraph is $K_{2,2}$. This $K_{2,2}$ contains exactly one 4-circuit as a set of edges; different traversals or starting points correspond to the same edge set and are not counted multiple times under the given distinctness criterion.\n\nConversely, any 4-circuit determines uniquely its two vertices in $U$ and its two vertices in $W$.
