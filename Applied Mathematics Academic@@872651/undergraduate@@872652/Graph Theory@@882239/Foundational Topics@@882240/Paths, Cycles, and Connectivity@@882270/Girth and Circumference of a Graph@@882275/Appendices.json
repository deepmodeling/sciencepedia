This problem provides an excellent opportunity to connect a graph's structure to its cycle properties, specifically by using the concept of bipartiteness to determine the girth. By first establishing a general property about the graph's cycles, you will set a lower bound on the girth before finding a specific cycle to show that this bound is tight [@problem_id:1506870].", "problem": "Consider a family of graphs denoted by $H_n$ for integers $n \\ge 1$. The vertex set of the graph $H_n$ is the set of all possible binary strings of length $n$. An edge exists between two distinct vertices if and only if their corresponding binary strings differ in exactly one position. The girth of a graph is defined as the length of its shortest cycle. For any integer $n \\ge 2$, the graph $H_n$ is guaranteed to contain at least one cycle. Determine the girth of the graph $H_n$ for any integer $n \\ge 2$.", "solution": "Let $H_{n}$ be the graph on all binary strings of length $n$, with an edge between two distinct vertices if and only if they differ in exactly one coordinate. This is the $n$-dimensional hypercube.\n\nFirst, we show $H_{n}$ is bipartite. Partition the vertex set into\n$$\nA=\\{x\\in\\{0,1\\}^{n}:\\text{the Hamming weight of }x\\text{ is even}\\},\\quad\nB=\\{x\\in\\{0,1\\}^{n}:\\text{the Hamming weight of }x\\text{ is odd}\\}.\n$$\nIf two vertices are adjacent, they differ in exactly one coordinate, so their Hamming weights differ by $1$. Hence every edge goes between $A$ and $B$, and there are no edges inside $A$ or inside $B$. Therefore $H_{n}$ is bipartite and contains no odd cycles. In particular, any cycle must have even length at least $4$; cycles of length $2$ do not occur because the graph is simple and has no multiple edges or loops.\n\nNext, we exhibit a $4$-cycle whenever $n\\ge 2$. Fix two distinct coordinate indices $i\\neq j$ in $\\{1,\\dots,n\\}$ and any vertex $x\\in\\{0,1\\}^{n}$. Let $e_{k}$ denote the binary string with a $1$ in position $k$ and $0$ elsewhere, and define\n$$\nv_{0}=x,\\quad v_{1}=x\\oplus e_{i},\\quad v_{2}=x\\oplus e_{i}\\oplus e_{j},\\quad v_{3}=x\\oplus e_{j},\n$$\nwhere $\\oplus$ denotes bitwise addition modulo $2$.

Thus $(v_{0},v_{1},v_{2},v_{3},v_{0})$ is a $4$-cycle.\n\nCombining these two facts, there are no cycles of length less than $4$, and a cycle of length $4$ exists for all $n\\ge 2$.

This problem [@problem_id:1506858] bridges graph theory with the tangible structure of Platonic solids, challenging you to use the graph's inherent geometric features—its pentagonal faces—to deduce its girth. It serves as a beautiful illustration of how real-world structures can be modeled as graphs and analyzed for their fundamental properties.", "problem": "The dodecahedral graph is a simple, undirected graph corresponding to the vertices and edges of a regular dodecahedron. This graph has 20 vertices and 30 edges. It is a 3-regular graph, meaning every vertex has a degree of 3. A key geometric property of the regular dodecahedron is that it is composed of 12 regular pentagonal faces. The girth of a graph is defined as the length of its shortest cycle. Determine the girth of the dodecahedral graph.", "solution": "The dodecahedral graph is the 1-skeleton of the regular dodecahedron, hence it is a simple, planar, 3-regular graph whose planar embedding has exactly 12 faces, each of which is a regular pentagon. By definition, the boundary of each face is a simple cycle of length 5, so there exists a 5-cycle in the graph. Therefore the girth $g$ satisfies $g \\leq 5$.\n\nTo show that no shorter cycle exists, suppose, for contradiction, that there is a simple cycle $C$ of length $k5$. In a planar embedding of a simple graph, $C$ is a Jordan curve whose interior is a union of faces. Each interior face of the dodecahedral graph has length 5. If $k=3$ or $k=4$, then the region bounded by $C$ would have to be decomposed into pentagonal faces glued along edges. Counting boundary edges of the region gives the standard boundary-count identity: if $F$ is the number of interior faces and $E_{\\text{int}}$ the number of edges shared by two interior faces, then the total boundary length $k$ satisfies\n$$\nk \\;=\\; 5F \\;-\\; 2E_{\\text{int}}.\n$$\nSince $F\\geq 1$ and the graph is simple and planar with all faces pentagons, the smallest possible boundary arises when $F=1$ and $E_{\\text{int}}=0$, which gives $k=5$. Any configuration with $F\\geq 2$ has at least one shared edge among interior faces, i.e., $E_{\\text{int}}\\geq 1$, and thus yields\n$$\nk \\;=\\; 5F - 2E_{\\text{int}} \\;\\geq\\; 5\\cdot 2 - 2\\cdot 1 \\;=\\; 8,\n$$\nwhich is larger.
