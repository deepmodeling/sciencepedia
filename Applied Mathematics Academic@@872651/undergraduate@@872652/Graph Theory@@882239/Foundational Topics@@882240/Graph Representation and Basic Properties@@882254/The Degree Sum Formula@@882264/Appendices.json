By modeling a computer network as a multigraph and using the given degree of each node, you will calculate the total number of communication links, reinforcing the fundamental relationship between vertex degrees and the number of edges. This exercise [@problem_id:1539807] is a foundational check of your understanding of the theorem.", "problem": "An experimental parallel computing architecture consists of 12 processing nodes. The network topology that connects these nodes is modeled as a multigraph, where the nodes are the vertices and the dedicated communication links are the edges. In this model, multiple parallel links can exist between any two nodes, and a link can also connect a node back to itself (a self-loop). The 'degree' of a node is defined as the total count of link endpoints connected to it. A system diagnostic scan provides the following details about the network's configuration:\n- There are exactly 3 nodes that each have a degree of 7.\n- There are exactly 4 nodes that each have a degree of 5.\n- All of the remaining nodes in the network have a degree of 3.\n\nBased on this information, calculate the total number of communication links (edges) in the network.", "solution": "We model the network as a multigraph allowing multiple edges and self-loops. The degree of a node is defined as the total number of link endpoints incident to it. By this definition, each ordinary edge contributes one endpoint to each of its two incident vertices, and a self-loop contributes two endpoints to the single vertex it is attached to. Therefore, the handshaking lemma applies in the form that the sum of the degrees equals twice the total number of edges.\n\nLet $m$ denote the total number of edges. The network has $12$ nodes, with degree distribution:\n- $3$ nodes of degree $7$,\n- $4$ nodes of degree $5$,\n- The remaining $12 - (3 + 4) = 5$ nodes of degree $3$.\n\nCompute the sum of degrees $S$:\n$$\nS = 3 \\cdot 7 + 4 \\cdot 5 + 5 \\cdot 3 = 21 + 20 + 15 = 56.\n$$\nBy the handshaking lemma for multigraphs (with loops counted as contributing two to the degree),\n$$\n\\sum \\text{degrees} = 2m \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad 2m = 56.\n$$\nSolving for $m$ gives\n$$\nm = \\frac{56}{2} = 28.\n$$\nThus, the total number of communication links (edges) is $28$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{28}$$", "id": "1539807"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond simple calculation, this problem explores a critical corollary of the Degree Sum Formula: the sum of degrees in any graph must be an even number.

A necessary condition for a degree sequence to be graphical is given by the Handshaking Lemma: the sum of all degrees equals $2|E|$ for some integer $|E|$, hence the sum of degrees must be even.\n\nCompute the sum of the proposed degrees:\n$$\n8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1+1=37.\n$$\nSince $37$ is odd, the Handshaking Lemma is violated, so no simple graph can realize this degree sequence. Therefore, it is not possible to construct such a network.\n\nAs an additional check, applying the Havel–Hakimi process also fails: removing the vertex of degree $8$ forces subtracting $1$ from each of the remaining degrees, yielding $6,5,4,3,2,1,0,0$, and the next step with leading $6$ requires reducing six entries including a $0$, producing a negative degree, which is impossible.
