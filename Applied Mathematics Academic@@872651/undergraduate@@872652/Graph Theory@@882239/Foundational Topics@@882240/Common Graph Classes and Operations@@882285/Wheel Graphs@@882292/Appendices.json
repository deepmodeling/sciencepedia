The network topology is designed as a wheel graph, denoted $W_5$. In this structure, one node acts as a central hub, and the remaining nodes are arranged in a cycle, with the hub connected to every node on the cycle.\n\nFor this specific network, node 1 is designated as the central hub. The remaining nodes (2, 3, 4, 5) form the outer cycle. The connections on the cycle are as follows: node 2 is connected to node 3, node 3 is connected to node 4, node 4 is connected to node 5, and node 5 is connected back to node 2, completing the cycle.\n\nAll connections in the network are bidirectional, meaning the graph is undirected. We also assume there are no self-loops (i.e., no node is connected to itself). Construct the adjacency matrix $A$ for this network. The rows and columns of the matrix should correspond to the nodes in ascending numerical order (e.g., row 1 and column 1 correspond to node 1). The entries of the adjacency matrix, $A_{ij}$, are defined as 1 if an edge exists between node $i$ and node $j$, and 0 otherwise.", "solution": "By definition, the adjacency matrix $A$ of a simple undirected graph has entries $A_{ij}=1$ if there is an edge between nodes $i$ and $j$, and $A_{ij}=0$ otherwise.

Since there are no self-loops, $A_{ii}=0$ for all $i$.\n\nIn the given wheel graph $W_{5}$, node $1$ is the central hub, connected to every other node: edges $(1,2)$, $(1,3)$, $(1,4)$, $(1,5)$.

Hence $|S| \\geq 8$, which is not minimal.\n\nCase 2: $h \\in S$. Then all spokes are covered by $h$, and it remains to cover the cycle edges of $C_{8}$ using rim vertices. We first prove that any vertex cover of $C_{8}$ has size at least $4$: consider the matching $M=\\{v_{1}v_{2}, v_{3}v_{4}, v_{5}v_{6}, v_{7}v_{8}\\}$ of size $4$ in $C_{8}$. Any vertex cover of $C_{8}$ must contain at least one endpoint of each edge in $M$, so it has size at least $4$. Conversely, the set $\\{v_{2}, v_{4}, v_{6}, v_{8}\\}$ covers all cycle edges, so the minimum vertex cover size of $C_{8}$ is exactly $4$.\n\nTherefore, in this case any vertex cover $S$ of $W_{9}$ has $|S| \\geq 1+4=5$. This bound is tight: for example, $S=\\{h, v_{2}, v_{4}, v_{6}, v_{8}\\}$ covers every spoke (by $h$) and every cycle edge (by the alternating rim vertices), so $|S|=5$ is achievable.\n\nCombining the two cases, the minimum vertex cover size for $W_{9}$ is $5$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5}$$", "id": "1555575"}]}
