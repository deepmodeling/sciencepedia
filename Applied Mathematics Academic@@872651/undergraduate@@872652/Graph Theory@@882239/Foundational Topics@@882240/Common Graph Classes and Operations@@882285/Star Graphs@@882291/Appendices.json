The adjacency matrix is a fundamental tool for this purpose, encoding the connections between vertices in a way that computers can process.

The network has a single central router and three peripheral computers. Each computer is connected directly to the central router, but not to any other computer. This structure forms a star graph $S_4$, defined as a graph with 4 total vertices: one central vertex connected to the 3 other vertices (leaves).\n\nLet the vertices of this graph be labeled such that the central router is assigned the label $v_1$, and the peripheral computers are assigned the labels $v_2$, $v_3$, and $v_4$.\n\nThe connectivity of a graph with $n$ vertices labeled $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n$ can be represented by its adjacency matrix $A$, which is an $n \\times n$ matrix. The entry in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column, denoted $A_{ij}$, is defined as 1 if an edge exists between vertex $v_i$ and vertex $v_j$, and 0 otherwise. By convention, for a simple graph, there are no edges from a vertex to itself.\n\nBased on this information, determine the adjacency matrix for the described $S_4$ graph with the specified vertex labeling.", "solution": "We are given a simple undirected graph with vertices labeled $v_{1},v_{2},v_{3},v_{4}$, where $v_{1}$ is the central vertex connected to each of $v_{2},v_{3},v_{4}$, and no other edges exist. For a simple graph, the adjacency matrix $A$ is defined by $A_{ij}=1$ if there is an edge between $v_{i}$ and $v_{j}$, and $A_{ij}=0$ otherwise, with $A_{ii}=0$ for all $i$.\n\nIn the star $S_{4}$ with this labeling, the edges are precisely $\\{(v_{1},v_{2}), (v_{1},v_{3}), (v_{1},v_{4})\\}$. Because the graph is undirected, $A$ is symmetric, so $A_{12}=A_{21}=1$, $A_{13}=A_{31}=1$, and $A_{14}=A_{41}=1$.

The product line consists of one 'flagship' device and $N$ distinct 'accessory' devices, where $N$ is a positive integer.

Due to branding guidelines, certain products are considered 'incompatible' and cannot be featured together in the same ad. The compatibility rules are as follows:\n\n1.  The flagship device is incompatible with every accessory device.\n2.

This exercise investigates the existence of a Hamiltonian path—a path that visits every node exactly once—within the unique topology of a star graph. Analyzing the conditions under which such a path is possible provides key insights into the structural properties and limitations of centralized networks [@problem_id:1535249].", "problem": "A network administrator is designing a 'hub-and-spoke' network topology. A network with a total of $n$ nodes consists of one central 'hub' node and $n-1$ peripheral 'spoke' nodes. A communication link (an edge) exists between the hub and each of the $n-1$ spokes, but no links exist directly between any two spoke nodes.\n\nThe administrator needs to test a data-validation protocol where a special packet must originate at some node and be routed through the network, visiting every single node exactly once before terminating.

The required routing path is a Hamiltonian path, i.e., a simple path that visits every vertex exactly once.\n\nObservation: In $K_{1,n-1}$, no two spokes are adjacent. Therefore, the only way to move from one spoke to another is through the hub. However, in a Hamiltonian path, no vertex can be visited more than once. Consequently, a Hamiltonian path can include at most two distinct spokes: starting at one spoke, going to the hub, and then to a second spoke. Including a third spoke would require revisiting the hub, which is not allowed.\n\nSince all non-hub vertices are spokes, the total number of spokes used by a Hamiltonian path must equal the total number of spokes in the graph. Thus, a Hamiltonian path can exist only if the total number of spokes satisfies $n-1 \\le 2 \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad n \\le 3$.\n\nIt remains to verify existence for these cases:\n- For $n=1$, the single vertex itself is a Hamiltonian path (trivial path).\n- For $n=2$, the unique edge between hub and the single spoke is a Hamiltonian path.\n- For $n=3$, a Hamiltonian path exists: spoke $1 \\to$ hub $\\to$ spoke $2$.\n\nFor $n \\ge 4$, there are at least $3$ spokes, which is impossible for a Hamiltonian path as argued. Therefore, the routing path exists only for $n=1,2,3$, which corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1535249"}]}
