Yes, $H$ is a line graph, and a valid root graph is the complete graph on 4 vertices, $K_4$.", "solution": "Let $H$ be the bowtie graph with vertex set $V(H)=\\{v_{0},v_{1},v_{2},v_{3},v_{4}\\}$ and edge set $E(H)=\\{(v_{0},v_{1}),(v_{1},v_{2}),(v_{2},v_{0}),(v_{0},v_{3}),(v_{3},v_{4}),(v_{4},v_{0})\\}$. The degree sequence of $H$ is $\\{4,2,2,2,2\\}$, with $v_{0}$ of degree $4$ and all other vertices of degree $2$. By definition of a line graph, if $H=L(G)$ for some simple graph $G$, then vertices of $H$ correspond to edges of $G$, and adjacency in $H$ corresponds to edge-incidence in $G$. For an edge $e=xy$ of $G$, its image vertex in $L(G)$ has degree $\\deg_{L(G)}(e)=\\deg_{G}(x)+\\deg_{G}(y)-2$.\n\nWe first construct a candidate root graph $G$ whose line graph is exactly $H$. Take a tree on $6$ vertices with exactly two adjacent vertices of degree $3$. Concretely, let $G$ have vertices $\\{u,v,a,b,c,d\\}$ and edges $\\{uv,ua,ub,vc,vd\\}$. Then $G$ has $5$ edges, so $L(G)$ has $5$ vertices. Label the vertices of $L(G)$ by the corresponding edges of $G$ as $e_{0}=uv$, $e_{1}=ua$, $e_{2}=ub$, $e_{3}=vc$, $e_{4}=vd$. Two vertices $e_{i},e_{j}$ in $L(G)$ are adjacent if and only if the edges in $G$ share an endpoint. The adjacencies are as follows:\n- $e_{1}$ and $e_{2}$ are adjacent (share $u$), and both are adjacent to $e_{0}$ (share $u$ with $e_{0}$).\n- $e_{3}$ and $e_{4}$ are adjacent (share $v$), and both are adjacent to $e_{0}$ (share $v$ with $e_{0}$).\n- No other pairs among $\\{e_{1},e_{2},e_{3},e_{4}\\}$ are adjacent, since they do not share endpoints in $G$.\n\nThus $L(G)$ consists of two triangles $\\{e_{0},e_{1},e_{2}\\}$ and $\\{e_{0},e_{3},e_{4}\\}$ sharing the vertex $e_{0}$, which is precisely the bowtie graph $H$. Moreover, the degrees match: $\\deg_{L(G)}(e_{0})=\\deg_{G}(u)+\\deg_{G}(v)-2=3+3-2=4$, and for each leaf edge like $e_{1}=ua$, $\\deg_{L(G)}(e_{1})=\\deg_{G}(u)+\\deg_{G}(a)-2=3+1-2=2$. Therefore $H$ is a line graph, with a valid root graph as described; this verifies statement D.\n\nTo exclude the other options, we use structural properties of line graphs:\n- For $G=C_{5}$, $L(C_{n})\\cong C_{n}$ for $n\\geq 3$. Hence $L(C_{5})$ is $5$-cycle with all vertices of degree $2$, not matching $H$ which has a vertex of degree $4$. Thus B is false.\n- For $G=K_{1,4}$, all $4$ edges share the center, so $L(K_{1,4})\\cong K_{4}$, which has $4$ vertices and is $3$-regular. This does not match $H$ on either vertex count or degree sequence. Thus C is false.\n- For $G=K_{4}$, $|E(K_4)|=6$, so $L(K_4)$ has $6$ vertices. Also, for any edge $xy$ of $K_4$, $\\deg_{L(K_4)}(xy)=\\deg_{K_4}(x)+\\deg_{K_4}(y)-2=3+3-2=4$, so $L(K_4)$ is $4$-regular, again not matching $H$. Thus E is false.\n- Since we have explicitly constructed a root graph $G$ with $L(G)\\cong H$, statement A (that $H$ is not a line graph) is false.\n\nTherefore the only correct statement is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1519053"}]}
