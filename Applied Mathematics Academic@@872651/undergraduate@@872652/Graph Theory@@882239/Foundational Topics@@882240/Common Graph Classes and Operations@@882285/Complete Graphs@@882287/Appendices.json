Mastering this type of combinatorial counting is essential for analyzing network motifs and understanding the fundamental building blocks of complex graphs.

For maximum resilience and data integrity, each server maintains a direct, encrypted communication channel with every other server in the system. This network topology is equivalent to a complete graph $K_n$, where servers are vertices and communication channels are edges.\n\nA critical security operation, known as a 'triad verification', requires a group of three distinct servers where each server in the group can directly communicate with the other two.\n\nDerive a general formula for the total number of unique triad verification groups that can be formed in a system with $n$ servers, where $n \\geq 3$. Express your answer as a function of $n$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the total number of unique \"triad verification groups\" in a system of $n$ servers where every server is connected to every other. In the language of graph theory, the system is represented by a complete graph $K_n$, where the servers are the vertices and the communication channels are the edges.\n\nA \"triad verification group\" is defined as a set of three distinct servers, all mutually connected. In the graph $K_n$, this corresponds to a set of three vertices such that an edge exists between every pair of vertices in the set. This structure is precisely a triangle, also known as a complete subgraph on 3 vertices, or $K_3$.\n\nThe problem is therefore equivalent to finding the total number of distinct subgraphs isomorphic to $K_3$ within a $K_n$.\n\nIn a complete graph $K_n$, an edge exists between any two distinct vertices. This means that if we select any set of three vertices, they will automatically form a triangle, as all three possible edges connecting them are guaranteed to be present.\n\nConsequently, the task of counting the number of triangles simplifies to counting the number of ways to choose a subset of 3 vertices from the total set of $n$ vertices. The order in which we choose the three vertices does not matter, as the group {Server A, Server B, Server C} is the same as {Server B, Server A, Server C}. This is a classic combinatorics problem of combinations.\n\nThe number of ways to choose $k$ items from a set of $n$ distinct items is given by the binomial coefficient, denoted as $\\binom{n}{k}$, which is calculated as:\n$$ \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} $$\nFor our specific problem, we are choosing $k=3$ vertices from a set of $n$ vertices. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:\n$$ \\text{Number of triads} = \\binom{n}{3} = \\frac{n!}{3!(n-3)!} $$\nWe can expand the factorial terms to simplify the expression:\n$$ \\frac{n!}{3!(n-3)!} = \\frac{n \\times (n-1) \\times (n-2) \\times (n-3)!}{(3 \\times 2 \\times 1) \\times (n-3)!} $$\nThe $(n-3)!$ term in the numerator and the denominator cancels out:\n$$ \\binom{n}{3} = \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{3!} $$\nSince $3! = 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6$, the final formula is:\n$$ \\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6} $$\nThis expression gives the total number of unique triad verification groups for any $n \\geq 3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6}}$$", "id": "1491069"}, {"introduction": "While a complete graph represents all possible connections, many real-world applications require finding the most efficient network that still connects all nodes. This problem introduces the concept of a spanning tree—a minimal, connected subgraph—and applies the famous Cayley's formula to count the number of possible spanning trees within a complete graph $K_n$.

For any connected simple graph on $n$ vertices, the minimal number of edges is $n-1$, and achieving $n-1$ edges implies the graph is a tree; conversely, any tree is connected and has exactly $n-1$ edges. Therefore, viable designs are exactly the spanning trees on the $4$ labeled vertices.\n\nThe number of labeled trees on $n$ vertices is given by Cayley’s formula:\n$$\nT(n)=n^{n-2}.\n$$\nSubstituting $n=4$ gives\n$$\nT(4)=4^{4-2}=4^{2}=16.\n$$\n\nAs a verification by types: the two unlabeled tree types on $4$ vertices are the star $K_{1,3}$ and the path $P_{4}$. The number of labeled stars is $4$ (choose the center), and the number of labeled paths is $\\frac{4!}{2}=12$ (all orderings of the four labels along the path, modulo reversal).
