The graph forms a single path connecting all vertices, so it is connected. Thus, $G_A$ is a tree (specifically, the path graph $P_6$). The degrees of its vertices are $d(1)=1$, $d(6)=1$, and $d(2)=d(3)=d(4)=d(5)=2$. The sorted degree sequence is $(1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2)$.\n- $G_B$ has the edge set $\\{(1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5), (1,6)\\}$. It has 5 edges. Vertex 1 is connected to all other vertices, so the graph is connected. Thus, $G_B$ is a tree (specifically, the star graph $K_{1,5}$). The degrees of its vertices are $d(1)=5$ and $d(2)=d(3)=d(4)=d(5)=d(6)=1$. The sorted degree sequence is $(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5)$.\n- **Isomorphism Check:** The degree sequence of $G_A$ is $(1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2)$ and the degree sequence of $G_B$ is $(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5)$. Since their degree sequences are different, the graphs are not isomorphic.\n- **Conclusion:** Both are trees, and they are not isomorphic. This pair matches the required conditions.\n\n**Analysis of Pair B**\n- $G_A$ has the edge set $\\{(1,4), (2,4), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6)\\}$. It has 5 edges. It is connected, for instance, via the path $1-4-5-6$. Therefore, $G_A$ is a tree. The degrees are $d(1)=1, d(2)=1, d(3)=1, d(6)=1, d(5)=2, d(4)=4$.

Therefore, $G_B$ is a tree. The degrees are $d(1)=1, d(3)=1, d(4)=1, d(6)=1, d(5)=2, d(2)=4$. The sorted degree sequence is $(1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4)$.\n- **Isomorphism Check:** Both graphs have the same degree sequence. This does not guarantee isomorphism, but suggests it's possible. Let's try to construct an isomorphism $f:V_A \\to V_B$. The vertices of degree 4 must map to each other, so $f(4)=2$. The vertex of degree 2 must map to the vertex of degree 2, so $f(5)=5$. The neighbor of the degree-2 vertex which is not the degree-4 vertex must map accordingly. In $G_A$, vertex 6 is adjacent to 5. In $G_B$, vertex 6 is adjacent to 5. So, $f(6)=6$. The remaining vertices {1,2,3} are neighbors of vertex 4 in $G_A$ and have degree 1. The remaining vertices {1,3,4} are neighbors of vertex 2 in $G_B$ and have degree 1. We can map them arbitrarily, for example, $f(1)=1, f(2)=3, f(3)=4$. The function $f = \\{1\\to1, 2\\to3, 3\\to4, 4\\to2, 5\\to5, 6\\to6\\}$ is a bijection that preserves adjacency. Thus, $G_A$ and $G_B$ are isomorphic.\n- **Conclusion:** This pair consists of two isomorphic trees. It does not satisfy the conditions.\n\n**Analysis of Pair C**\n- $G_A$ is the same graph as in Pair A, which is the path graph $P_6$. It is a tree.\n- $G_B$ has the edge set $\\{(1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6), (6,1)\\}$. It has 6 edges. For $n=6$ vertices, a tree must have 5 edges. Since $|E_B|=6 \\neq 5$, $G_B$ is not a tree. In fact, it is the cycle graph $C_6$.\n- **Conclusion:** $G_B$ is not a tree.
