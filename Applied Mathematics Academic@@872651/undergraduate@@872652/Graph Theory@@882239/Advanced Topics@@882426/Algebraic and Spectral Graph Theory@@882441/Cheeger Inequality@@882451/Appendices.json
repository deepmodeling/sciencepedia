To ensure high availability and data throughput, the network is designed with maximal connectivity: every server has a direct, dedicated communication link to every other server.

A crucial measure of a network's resilience to being partitioned is its Cheeger constant (or isoperimetric number), denoted $h(G)$. For a graph $G$ with vertex set $V$, the Cheeger constant measures the minimum \"cost\" of partitioning the graph relative to the size of the smaller part.
