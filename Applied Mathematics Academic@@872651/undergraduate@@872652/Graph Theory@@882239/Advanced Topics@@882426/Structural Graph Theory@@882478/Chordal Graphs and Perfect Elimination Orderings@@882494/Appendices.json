This exercise challenges you to apply this definition to a graph constructed via a Cartesian product, a common operation in graph theory. By visualizing the resulting structure and searching for a chordless cycle, you will develop a crucial intuition for identifying this important graph property. [@problem_id:1487704]", "problem": "In graph theory, we can construct new graphs from existing ones using various product operations. This problem explores a property of a graph built using the Cartesian product.\n\nFirst, let's establish the necessary definitions:\n1.  A **path graph** on $n$ vertices, denoted $P_n$, consists of vertices $v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n$ and edges $(v_i, v_{i+1})$ for all $1 \\le i < n$.\n2.  The **Cartesian product** of two graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$, denoted $G_1 \\times G_2$, is a graph with vertex set $V(G_1) \\times V(G_2)$. Two vertices $(u_1, u_2)$ and $(v_1, v_2)$ are adjacent in $G_1 \\times G_2$ if and only if either:\n    -   $u_1 = v_1$ and $u_2$ is adjacent to $v_2$ in $G_2$, or\n    -   $u_2 = v_2$ and $u_1$ is adjacent to $v_1$ in $G_1$.\n3.  A graph is called **chordal** if every cycle of length four or greater has a **chord**. A chord is an edge that connects two vertices of the cycle that are not adjacent in the cycle. An equivalent statement is that a chordal graph does not contain an induced cycle of length greater than three.\n\nConsider the graph $G$ constructed as the Cartesian product of two path graphs with two vertices each, that is, $G = P_2 \\times P_2$. Is the graph $G$ a chordal graph?\n\nA. Yes\n\nB. No", "solution": "By definition, the path graph $P_{2}$ has vertex set $\\{v_{1},v_{2}\\}$ with a single edge $(v_{1},v_{2})$. Take two copies: let the first have vertices $v_{1},v_{2}$ and the second have vertices $u_{1},u_{2}$, each with the single edge connecting the two vertices.\n\nThe Cartesian product $G=P_{2}\\times P_{2}$ has vertex set\n$$\nV(G)=\\{(v_{i},u_{j}) : i\\in\\{1,2\\},\\, j\\in\\{1,2\\}\\}.\n$$\nAdjacency in $G$ follows the product rule: two vertices $(v_{i},u_{j})$ and $(v_{k},u_{\\ell})$ are adjacent if and only if either $v_{i}=v_{k}$ and $u_{j}$ is adjacent to $u_{\\ell}$ in $P_{2}$, or $u_{j}=u_{\\ell}$ and $v_{i}$ is adjacent to $v_{k}$ in $P_{2}$. Since the only adjacencies in each $P_{2}$ are $v_{1}\\sim v_{2}$ and $u_{1}\\sim u_{2}$, the edges of $G$ are exactly\n$$\n(v_{1},u_{1})\\sim(v_{2},u_{1}),\\quad (v_{1},u_{2})\\sim(v_{2},u_{2}),\\quad (v_{1},u_{1})\\sim(v_{1},u_{2}),\\quad (v_{2},u_{1})\\sim(v_{2},u_{2}).\n$$\nThese four edges form the 4-cycle\n$$\n(v_{1},u_{1})-(v_{1},u_{2})-(v_{2},u_{2})-(v_{2},u_{1})-(v_{1},u_{1}).\n$$\nA chord of this cycle would have to be one of the diagonals, namely $(v_{1},u_{1})\\sim(v_{2},u_{2})$ or $(v_{1},u_{2})\\sim(v_{2},u_{1})$. By the Cartesian product adjacency rule, neither of these is an edge because in each case both coordinates differ and adjacency requires equality in one coordinate and adjacency in the other. Therefore the 4-cycle in $G$ has no chord.\n\nBy the definition of chordal graphs, a graph is chordal if it contains no induced cycle of length at least four.
