An edge contraction on an edge $(u, v)$ removes the edge and merges its two endpoints, $u$ and $v$, into a single new vertex $w$. Any edges that were incident to either $u$ or $v$ become incident to $w$. If this process creates multiple edges between the same two vertices, they are merged into a single edge to ensure the resulting graph is simple (contains no loops or multiple edges between the same two vertices).\n\nConsider the 4-cycle graph, denoted $C_4$.

A graph $H$ is a **minor** of a graph $G$ if $H$ can be obtained from $G$ by a sequence of three types of operations: deleting an edge, deleting an isolated vertex, and contracting an edge.

A subgraph $H$ of $G$ must satisfy $V_{H} \\subseteq V_{G}$ and $E_{H} \\subseteq E_{G}$. A minor of $G$ is obtained by a sequence of edge deletions, isolated vertex deletions, and edge contractions. Contracting an edge merges its endpoints and preserves adjacency to other vertices.\n\nWe analyze each option:\n\nA. $E_{A}$ is the $5$-cycle $1-2-3-4-5-1$. This graph does not contain $C_{4}$ as a subgraph, because any selection of $4$ vertices from a $5$-cycle induces at most a path and does not include the needed fourth edge to complete a $4$-cycle. However, $C_{4}$ is a minor: contract one edge of the $5$-cycle, for instance contract $(5,1)$ to merge $\\{5,1\\}$ into a single vertex $w$, producing the $4$-cycle $w-2-3-4-w$. Therefore, $A$ contains $C_{4}$ as a minor but not as a subgraph.\n\nB. $E_{B}$ contains the edges $(1,2),(2,3),(3,4),(4,1)$, which already form a $4$-cycle on vertices $\\{1,2,3,4\\}$. Hence $C_{4}$ is a subgraph, so this option does not satisfy the requirement.\n\nC. $E_{C}$ is the star $K_{1,4}$ centered at $5$, which is a tree. A minor of a tree is a tree, since edge contractions and deletions cannot create cycles. Because $C_{4}$ contains a cycle, it cannot be a minor of a tree. Also, it is not a subgraph. Therefore this option does not satisfy the requirement.\n\nD. $E_{D}$ is the $5$-cycle $1-2-3-4-5-1$ with an added chord $(1,3)$. The vertices $\\{1,3,4,5\\}$ with edges $(1,3),(3,4),(4,5),(5,1)$ form a $4$-cycle, so $C_{4}$ is a subgraph. Thus this option does not satisfy the requirement.\n\nE. $E_{E}$ is the disjoint union of a triangle on $\\{1,2,3\\}$ and an edge $(4,5)$. Any connected minor must be contained in a single connected component. The triangle component has only three vertices, so it cannot yield $C_{4}$ as a minor (a minor cannot increase the number of vertices needed for a connected graph like $C_{4}$). The edge component is too small as well. Hence $C_{4}$ is not a minor and also not a subgraph.

This final practice poses a design challenge: construct the smallest possible graph that contains two different target graphs, the 4-cycle ($C_4$) and the star graph ($K_{1,3}$), as minors. This task [@problem_id:1507837] requires you to synthesize your understanding of minor operations and use logical deduction to satisfy multiple constraints, moving from simple analysis to creative problem-solving.", "problem": "In graph theory, a graph $H$ is said to be a minor of another graph $G$ if $H$ can be obtained from $G$ by a sequence of three basic operations: deleting vertices, deleting edges, and contracting edges. An edge contraction is the process of merging two adjacent vertices, say $u$ and $v$, into a single new vertex whose incident edges are all edges that were incident to either $u$ or $v$, with the exception of the edge $\\{u,v\\}$ itself and any resulting multiple edges.\n\nConsider two specific simple graphs:\n1. The cycle graph on four vertices, denoted $C_4$. This graph consists of four vertices connected in a single closed loop, having four edges.\n2. The star graph with four vertices, denoted $K_{1,3}$. This graph has a central vertex connected to three distinct outer vertices, called leaves, and has three edges in total.\n\nYour task is to identify the properties of the smallest possible simple graph $G$ that has both $C_4$ and $K_{1,3}$ as minors. A graph is considered 'smaller' than another if it has fewer vertices. If two graphs have the same number of vertices, the one with fewer edges is considered smaller.\n\nWhat are the number of vertices, $V$, and the number of edges, $E$, of this smallest graph $G$? The final answer should be a pair of integers, $(V, E)$.", "solution": "By definition of a minor, vertex deletion and edge contraction never increase the number of vertices, while edge deletion leaves the number of vertices unchanged. Therefore, for any minor $H$ of $G$, we have $|V(H)| \\leq |V(G)|$. Since $|V(C_{4})|=4$, every $G$ having $C_{4}$ as a minor must satisfy $|V(G)| \\geq 4$. Thus the smallest possible vertex count is $V=4$.\n\nNow assume $|V(G)|=4$. To obtain $C_{4}$ (which has four vertices) as a minor of $G$, we cannot delete vertices or contract edges, because either operation would strictly reduce the number of vertices below $4$. Hence $C_{4}$ must occur as a subgraph of $G$. In particular, $G$ must contain all four edges of a $4$-cycle, so $E \\geq 4$. If $E=4$, the only possibility is that $G$ is exactly $C_{4}$.\n\nNext, $K_{1,3}$ has $4$ vertices, so by the same reasoning, if $|V(G)|=4$ and $K_{1,3}$ is a minor of $G$, then $K_{1,3}$ must be a subgraph of $G$. However, $C_{4}$ has degree sequence $(2,2,2,2)$ and contains no vertex of degree $3$, so it does not contain $K_{1,3}$ as a subgraph. Therefore $E \\neq 4$.\n\nConsider $E=5$ on $4$ vertices. Up to isomorphism, the unique simple graph with $4$ vertices and $5$ edges is $K_{4}$ with one edge deleted; equivalently, $C_{4}$ with one diagonal added. This graph contains $C_{4}$ as a subgraph (delete the diagonal) and also contains $K_{1,3}$ as a subgraph: an endpoint of the diagonal has degree $3$ and is adjacent to all three other vertices; selecting its three incident edges gives a $K_{1,3}$ subgraph (any additional edges among the leaves can be ignored by edge deletion). Hence $V=4$ and $E=5$ is feasible.\n\nSince any graph with fewer than $4$ vertices cannot have $C_{4}$ as a minor, and among $4$-vertex graphs at least $5$ edges are necessary to also contain a $K_{1,3}$ subgraph while containing a $C_{4}$ subgraph, the smallest possible $G$ has $(V,E)=(4,5)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{(4, 5)}$$", "id": "1507837"}]}
