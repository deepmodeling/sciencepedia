We must check each option against the definition of an ear decomposition.\n\nFirst, let's establish the properties of the initial graph. The graph $Q_3$ has 8 vertices (the binary strings from '000' to '111') and is 3-regular, so it has $\\frac{8 \\times 3}{2} = 12$ edges. The starting cycle is $P_0 = (\\text{'000'},\\text{'001'},\\text{'011'},\\text{'010'},\\text{'000'})$. This is a cycle of length 4. The initial subgraph $G_0 = P_0$ has vertex set $V(G_0) = \\{\\text{'000'},\\text{'001'},\\text{'010'},\\text{'011'}\\}$ and 4 edges. A valid and complete ear decomposition must add a sequence of ears that are valid paths in $Q_3$, satisfy the ear condition at each step, and collectively add the remaining $12 - 4 = 8$ edges to cover the entire graph $Q_3$.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\n**Option A:** The proposed sequence of ears is $[P_1, P_2, P_3, P_4]$, where $P_1 = (\\text{'000'},\\text{'100'},\\text{'110'},\\text{'010'})$, $P_2 = (\\text{'001'},\\text{'101'},\\text{'111'},\\text{'011'})$, $P_3 = (\\text{'100'},\\text{'101'})$, and $P_4 = (\\text{'110'},\\text{'111'})$.\n\n1.  Consider $P_1 = (\\text{'000'},\\text{'100'},\\text{'110'},\\text{'010'})$.\n    - The endpoints are '000' and '010', which are in $V(G_0)$.\n    - The internal vertices are '100' and '110', which are not in $V(G_0)$.\n    - The path is valid in $Q_3$: ('000','100'), ('100','110'), and ('110','010') are all valid edges as the vertices in each pair differ by one bit.\n    - Thus, $P_1$ is a valid ear. The new graph is $G_1 = G_0 \\cup P_1$, with $V(G_1) = \\{\\text{'000'},\\text{'001'},\\text{'010'},\\text{'011'},\\text{'100'},\\text{'110'}\\}$ and $4+3=7$ edges.\n\n2.  Consider $P_2 = (\\text{'001'},\\text{'101'},\\text{'111'},\\text{'011'})$.\n    - The endpoints '001' and '011' are in $V(G_0) \\subset V(G_1)$.\n    - The internal vertices '101' and '111' are not in $V(G_1)$.\n    - The path is valid in $Q_3$.\n    - Thus, $P_2$ is a valid ear. The new graph is $G_2 = G_1 \\cup P_2$, with $V(G_2) = V(Q_3)$ (all 8 vertices) and $7+3=10$ edges.\n\n3.  Consider $P_3 = (\\text{'100'},\\text{'101'})$.\n    - The endpoints '100' and '101' are in $V(G_2)$ (from $P_1$ and $P_2$ respectively).\n    - There are no internal vertices.\n    - The path is a valid edge in $Q_3$.\n    - Thus, $P_3$ is a valid ear. The new graph $G_3 = G_2 \\cup P_3$ has $10+1=11$ edges.\n\n4.  Consider $P_4 = (\\text{'110'},\\text{'111'})$.\n    - The endpoints '110' and '111' are in $V(G_2) \\subset V(G_3)$.\n    - There are no internal vertices.\n    - The path is a valid edge in $Q_3$.\n    - Thus, $P_4$ is a valid ear. The graph $G_4 = G_3 \\cup P_4$ has $11+1=12$ edges.\n\nThe sequence of paths satisfies all conditions and covers all 12 edges of $Q_3$. Therefore, Option A is a correct ear decomposition.\n\n**Option B:** The proposed sequence starts with $P_1 = (\\text{'000'},\\text{'100'},\\text{'110'},\\text{'010'})$, which is a valid ear. The next ear is $P_2 = (\\text{'001'},\\text{'000'},\\text{'010'})$.\n- The endpoints are '001' and '010', which are in $V(G_1) = V(G_0) \\cup V(P_1)$.\n- The internal vertex is '000'. However, '000' is in $V(G_0) \\subset V(G_1)$.\nThis violates the condition that internal vertices of an ear must not be in the previously constructed subgraph. Thus, Option B is incorrect.\n\n**Option C:** The sequence starts with $P_1 = (\\text{'000'},\\text{'100'},\\text{'110'},\\text{'010'})$, which is valid. The next ear is $P_2 = (\\text{'001'},\\text{'111'},\\text{'011'})$.\n- Let's check if this is a valid path in $Q_3$. The first segment is ('001','111'). The binary string '001' differs from '111' in the first two bits (1st: 0/1, 2nd: 0/1, 3rd: 1/1). Since they differ in more than one position, they are not adjacent in $Q_3$.\n- Therefore, $P_2$ is not a valid path in $Q_3$. Option C is incorrect.\n\n**Option D:** The proposed sequence is $[P_1, P_2]$, where $P_1 = (\\text{'000'},\\text{'100'},\\text{'101'},\\text{'001'})$ and $P_2 = (\\text{'010'},\\text{'110'},\\text{'111'},\\text{'011'})$.\n- Let's check $P_1$. Endpoints '000','001' are in $V(G_0)$. Internal vertices '100','101' are not. The path is valid in $Q_3$. So $P_1$ is a valid ear of length 3. After adding $P_1$, the graph $G_1$ has $4+3=7$ edges.\n- Let's check $P_2$. Endpoints '010','011' are in $V(G_0) \\subset V(G_1)$. Internal vertices '110','111' are not in $V(G_1)$. The path is valid in $Q_3$. So $P_2$ is a valid ear of length 3.\n- The total number of edges in $P_0 \\cup P_1 \\cup P_2$ is $4 + 3 + 3 = 10$.\n- Since $Q_3$ has 12 edges, this set of ears is incomplete. The problem asks for a sequence that *completes* the decomposition. The list in Option D is a valid starting sequence of ears, but it's not the complete sequence. Thus, Option D is incorrect.\n\nBased on the analysis, only Option A provides a valid and complete sequence of ears for the decomposition.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1492134"}, {"introduction": "Having practiced constructing one valid decomposition, we now explore the idea that a graph can have multiple, structurally different decompositions.

The graph $K_4$ has $4$ vertices and $6$ edges. An ear decomposition partitions the edges into $P_0$ (a simple cycle) and subsequent ears $P_i$, $i \\geq 1$, where each $P_i$ is a simple path whose endpoints lie in $G_{i-1}$ and whose internal vertices do not. The sequence of ear lengths is $(l_1, \\ldots, l_k)$ with $l_i$ equal to the number of edges in $P_i$, and $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} l_i = |E(K_4)| - |E(P_0)|$.\n\nFirst, $P_0$ must be a cycle in $K_4$. The only possible cycle lengths in $K_4$ are $3$ (a triangle) and $4$ (a $4$-cycle), since $K_4$ is complete on $4$ vertices.\n\nCase 1: $P_0$ is a triangle (length $3$). Then $G_0$ contains exactly $3$ vertices and $3$ edges; the fourth vertex is not in $G_0$. For the first ear $P_1$, both endpoints must lie in $G_0$ and all internal vertices must be outside $G_0$. The only vertex outside $G_0$ is the fourth vertex, so the only possible ear is a path of length $2$ between two triangle vertices whose unique internal vertex is the outside vertex. A length $1$ ear is impossible at this step because that would require both endpoints in $G_0$, but any unused length $1$ edge incident to the outside vertex would have one endpoint not in $G_0$. Thus $l_1=2$. After adding this ear, $5$ edges are present, and exactly one edge remains: the edge from the new vertex to the third triangle vertex. This edge can be added as a length $1$ ear because now both endpoints lie in the current subgraph and there are no internal vertices. Therefore the ear-length sequence is $(2,1)$, and no other sequence can arise from a triangular $P_0$.\n\nCase 2: $P_0$ is a $4$-cycle (length $4$). Then $G_0$ contains all $4$ vertices and $4$ edges; the remaining edges are the two diagonals. Any subsequent ear must have endpoints in $G_0$ and internal vertices outside $G_0$. Since there are no vertices outside $G_0$, no ear can have any internal vertex; hence every ear must be of length $1$. Exactly two edges remain, so the only possible ear-length sequence is $(1,1)$. A length $2$ ear is impossible here because that would require at least one internal vertex not in $G_0$, and none exist.\n\nThese two cases exhaust all possibilities, yielding exactly the sequences $(2,1)$ and $(1,1)$.
