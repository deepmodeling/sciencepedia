This problem models a communication network as a 5-cycle graph, $C_5$, which is the quintessential example of an imperfect graph. By calculating its chromatic number, $\\chi(G)$, and clique number, $\\omega(G)$, you will directly see how it fails the core requirement for perfection and understand why odd cycles (of length 5 or more) are so crucial in this theory [@problem_id:1545366].", "problem": "A small fleet of five autonomous drones, labeled $D_1, D_2, D_3, D_4, D_5$, need to communicate with each other using a set of frequency channels. To avoid interference, any two drones that are within direct communication range of each other must be assigned different channels. The system is designed such that interference only occurs between specific pairs. The connections are as follows: $D_1$ is in range of $D_2$ and $D_5$; $D_2$ is in range of $D_1$ and $D_3$; $D_3$ is in range of $D_2$ and $D_4$; $D_4$ is in range of $D_3$ and $D_5$; and $D_5$ is in range of $D_4$ and $D_1$.\n\nFor a communication network to be considered \"frequency-optimal\", it must satisfy a special property: for any selected subset of drones from the fleet, the minimum number of frequency channels required for that subset to communicate without interference must be equal to the maximum number of drones in that subset that are all mutually in range of one another.\n\nLet the entire five-drone network be represented by a graph $G$. Let $\\chi(G)$ be the minimum number of channels required for the entire network, and let $\\omega(G)$ be the maximum number of drones in the network that are all mutually in range of one another.\n\nBased on the definition provided, is the five-drone communication network frequency-optimal?\n\nA.
