Equivalently, a graph is a comparability graph if its edges can be assigned a direction (oriented) to form a directed acyclic graph that is transitively closed. This means if there is a directed edge from vertex $x$ to $y$ and from $y$ to $z$, there must be a directed edge from $x$ to $z$.\n\nConsider a simple, undirected graph $G$ constructed as follows. It has four vertices, which we label $v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4$. The graph is formed by taking two triangles, $(v_1, v_2, v_3)$ and $(v_1, v_3, v_4)$, and joining them along their shared edge $\\{v_1, v_3\\}$. The complete set of edges is therefore $E = \\{\\{v_1, v_2\\}, \\{v_2, v_3\\}, \\{v_3, v_1\\}, \\{v_1, v_4\\}, \\{v_4, v_3\\}\\}$.\n\nWhich one of the following statements about the graph $G$ is true?\n\nA. The graph is a comparability graph.\n\nB. The graph is not a comparability graph because the presence of triangles (cycles of length 3) prevents a transitive orientation.\n\nC. The graph is not a comparability graph because it contains an induced cycle of length 4.\n\nD. The graph is not a comparability graph because it is not a perfect graph.", "solution": "We are given the graph with vertex set $V=\\{v_{1},v_{2},v_{3},v_{4}\\}$ and edge set $E=\\{\\{v_{1},v_{2}\\},\\{v_{2},v_{3}\\},\\{v_{3},v_{1}\\},\\{v_{1},v_{4}\\},\\{v_{4},v_{3}\\}\\}$. This is the $K_{4}$ minus the edge $\\{v_{2},v_{4}\\}$ (the diamond graph).\n\nTo determine whether $G$ is a comparability graph, we must exhibit a partial order on $V$ whose comparability graph is exactly $G$, or equivalently, a transitive acyclic orientation of $E$.\n\nConstruct a strict partial order $\\prec$ on $V$ by declaring:\n$$\nv_{1}\\prec v_{2},\\quad v_{2}\\prec v_{3},\\quad v_{1}\\prec v_{3},\\quad v_{1}\\prec v_{4},\\quad v_{4}\\prec v_{3},\n$$\nand no relation between $v_{2}$ and $v_{4}$ (so $v_{2}$ and $v_{4}$ are incomparable). This relation is acyclic and transitive (indeed, it is the diamond-shaped poset with $v_{1}$ minimal, $v_{3}$ maximal, and $v_{2},v_{4}$ as incomparable middle elements). Its transitive closure contains $v_{1}\\prec v_{3}$, already listed, and does not force any relation between $v_{2}$ and $v_{4}$.\n\nOrient each edge of $G$ from the smaller to the larger element under $\\prec$. This yields the orientation\n$$\nv_{1}\\to v_{2},\\quad v_{2}\\to v_{3},\\quad v_{1}\\to v_{3},\\quad v_{1}\\to v_{4},\\quad v_{4}\\to v_{3}.\n$$\nThis directed graph is acyclic. It is also transitively closed on its edges: on the triangle $\\{v_{1},v_{2},v_{3}\\}$ we have $v_{1}\\to v_{2}$ and $v_{2}\\to v_{3}$, hence $v_{1}\\to v_{3}$, which is present; on the triangle $\\{v_{1},v_{3},v_{4}\\}$ we have $v_{1}\\to v_{4}$ and $v_{4}\\to v_{3}$, hence $v_{1}\\to v_{3}$, also present. Crucially, there is no directed two-step path between $v_{2}$ and $v_{4}$ (neither $v_{2}\\to v_{1}\\to v_{4}$ nor $v_{2}\\to v_{3}\\to v_{4}$ occurs, and similarly no path from $v_{4}$ to $v_{2}$), so no missing edge is forced by transitivity. Therefore this is a valid transitive orientation, and $G$ is a comparability graph.\n\nNow we check the alternatives:\n- Statement B is false: triangles do not preclude a transitive orientation; indeed, any triangle can be oriented transitively by choosing a linear order, as done above on both triangles.\n- Statement C is false: the only $4$-cycle $v_{2}-v_{1}-v_{4}-v_{3}-v_{2}$ has a chord $\\{v_{1},v_{3}\\}$, so there is no induced $4$-cycle.\n- Statement D is false: the graph is chordal (a $K_{4}$ minus one edge), hence perfect; moreover, perfectness is not the obstruction here.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1490509"}, {"introduction": "Comparability graphs serve as the visual representation of the relationships within a partially ordered set (poset).
