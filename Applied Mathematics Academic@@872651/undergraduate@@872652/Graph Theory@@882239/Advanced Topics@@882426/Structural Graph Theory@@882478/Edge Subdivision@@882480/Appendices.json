The initial design is a fully connected network with $n$ central servers, where $n \\ge 2$. This network can be modeled by a complete graph $K_n$, where the servers are vertices and the direct communication links are edges.\n\nTo improve signal integrity over long distances, the architect decides to place a signal-boosting relay station on every single communication link. In graph theory, this modification is known as subdividing each edge of the graph exactly once. Specifically, for every edge $(u, v)$ in the original graph $K_n$, the edge is removed and a new vertex $w$ is added, along with two new edges, $(u, w)$ and $(w, v)$.\n\nLet the resulting graph, which includes the original servers and the new relay stations, be denoted by $G'$.

The distance between any two vertices in a graph is defined as the number of edges in the shortest path connecting them.\n\nA new graph, $G'$, is formed by performing an operation known as edge subdivision on a single edge of $G$. The edge $(v_j, v_{j+1})$ is subdivided $k$ times. This operation involves removing the original edge $(v_j, v_{j+1})$ and introducing $k$ new, distinct vertices, say $w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_k$.

This final practice delves into the concept of graph isomorphism, a fundamental measure of structural equivalence [@problem_id:1500405]. By comparing the results of subdividing two different types of edges in a wheel graph, you will learn to use more sophisticated invariants to determine whether the resulting graphs are truly the same, or merely superficially similar.", "problem": "A wheel graph, denoted $W_n$, consists of a central vertex connected to all vertices of a cycle graph on $n-1$ vertices, $C_{n-1}$. Let us consider the wheel graph $W_5$, which has 5 vertices in total. We can label the central vertex as $c$ and the vertices on the outer cycle $C_4$ as $v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4$ in sequential order. The edges of $W_5$ can be categorized into two types: 'spoke' edges, which are of the form $\\{c, v_i\\}$, and 'rim' edges, which are of the form $\\{v_i, v_{i+1}\\}$ (where the index is taken modulo 4, so $v_5$ is identified with $v_1$).\n\nWe will create two new graphs by performing an 'edge subdivision'. To subdivide an edge $\\{u, v\\}$, we remove this edge and introduce a new vertex $w$, along with two new edges $\\{u, w\\}$ and $\\{w, v\\}$.\n\nLet $G_1$ be the graph obtained by subdividing the spoke edge $\\{c, v_1\\}$.\nLet $G_2$ be the graph obtained by subdividing the rim edge $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$.\n\nAre the graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$ isomorphic?\n\nA. Yes, because both $G_1$ and $G_2$ have 6 vertices and 9 edges.\n\nB. Yes, because the degree sequences of $G_1$ and $G_2$ are identical.\n\nC. No, because the vertex of degree 2 in $G_1$ is part of a 3-cycle, while the vertex of degree 2 in $G_2$ is not.\n\nD. No, because the degree-4 vertex in $G_1$ is adjacent to a degree-2 vertex, while the degree-4 vertex in $G_2$ is not.\n\nE. The question cannot be answered as the choice of which spoke or rim edge to subdivide affects the resulting graph's structure.", "solution": "Start with the wheel graph $W_{5}$ on vertices $\\{c,v_{1},v_{2},v_{3},v_{4}\\}$, where $c$ is adjacent to all $v_{i}$ and the $v_{i}$ form a $4$-cycle. In $W_{5}$, the degrees are: $\\deg(c)=4$ and $\\deg(v_{i})=3$ for $i\\in\\{1,2,3,4\\}$. The graph has $8$ edges (four spokes and four rim edges).\n\nSubdividing an edge $\\{u,v\\}$ removes that edge and introduces a new vertex $w$ with edges $\\{u,w\\}$ and $\\{w,v\\}$. This increases the vertex count by $1$ and the edge count by $1$.\n\nFor $G_{1}$ (subdivide the spoke $\\{c,v_{1}\\}$): introduce a new vertex $s$ and replace $\\{c,v_{1}\\}$ by $\\{c,s\\}$ and $\\{s,v_{1}\\}$. Then $\\deg(c)$ remains $4$ (loses $v_{1}$, gains $s$), $\\deg(v_{1})$ remains $3$ (loses $c$, gains $s$), $\\deg(v_{2})=\\deg(v_{3})=\\deg(v_{4})=3$, and the new vertex has $\\deg(s)=2$. Thus $G_{1}$ has one vertex of degree $4$, four vertices of degree $3$, and one vertex of degree $2$. It has $6$ vertices and $9$ edges.\n\nFor $G_{2}$ (subdivide the rim edge $\\{v_{1},v_{2}\\}$): introduce a new vertex $r$ and replace $\\{v_{1},v_{2}\\}$ by $\\{v_{1},r\\}$ and $\\{r,v_{2}\\}$. Then $\\deg(c)=4$ (unchanged), $\\deg(v_{1})$ and $\\deg(v_{2})$ remain $3$ (each loses one neighbor and gains $r$), $\\deg(v_{3})=\\deg(v_{4})=3$, and $\\deg(r)=2$. Thus $G_{2}$ also has one vertex of degree $4$, four of degree $3$, and one of degree $2$, and has $6$ vertices and $9$ edges.\n\nTherefore, the degree sequences and the pair $(\\text{number of vertices},\\text{number of edges})$ coincide for $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$, so options A and B alone do not establish isomorphism, since isomorphism requires more than matching degree sequences and sizes.\n\nTo decide isomorphism, use the invariant that isomorphisms preserve degrees and adjacency. Each graph has a unique vertex of degree $4$ and a unique vertex of degree $2$. Any isomorphism must map the degree-$4$ vertex to the degree-$4$ vertex and the degree-$2$ vertex to the degree-$2$ vertex.\n\nIn $G_{1}$, the degree-$4$ vertex is $c$ and the degree-$2$ vertex is $s$. They are adjacent because the edge $\\{c,s\\}$ was created by subdividing the spoke. In $G_{2}$, the degree-$4$ vertex is $c$ and the degree-$2$ vertex is $r$. They are not adjacent, because $r$ is only adjacent to $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$. Since adjacency between the unique degree-$4$ and degree-$2$ vertices differs between $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$, no isomorphism can exist. Hence the graphs are not isomorphic.\n\nFor completeness, the statement in option C is false: in $G_{1}$ the degree-$2$ vertex $s$ is adjacent only to $c$ and $v_{1}$, which are not adjacent to each other in $G_1$, so $s$ is not in any $3$-cycle; similarly, in $G_{2}$ the degree-$2$ vertex $r$ is adjacent to $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$, which are not adjacent after subdivision, so $r$ is not in any $3$-cycle.\n\nTherefore, the correct reason is that the degree-$4$ vertex is adjacent to the degree-$2$ vertex in $G_{1}$ but not in $G_{2}$, so the graphs are not isomorphic.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1500405"}]}
