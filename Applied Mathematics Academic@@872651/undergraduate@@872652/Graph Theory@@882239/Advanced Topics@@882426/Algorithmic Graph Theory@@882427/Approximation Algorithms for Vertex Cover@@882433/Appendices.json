This exercise is fundamental to appreciating how a provable performance bound, in this case a 2-approximation, is achieved.", "problem": "In the field of computational complexity theory, the Vertex Cover problem is a classic example of an NP-hard problem. Given a graph, the goal is to find a subset of vertices of minimum size such that every edge in the graph is connected to at least one vertex in the subset. Such a subset of minimum size is called a minimum (or optimal) vertex cover, and its size for a graph $G$ is denoted by $\\tau(G)$.\n\nSince finding the optimal solution is computationally difficult for large graphs, approximation algorithms are often used. One such algorithm is the maximal matching-based 2-approximation algorithm. It guarantees a solution that is no more than twice the size of the optimal solution. The algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1.  Begin with an empty set for the matching, $M = \\emptyset$. A matching is a set of edges where no two edges share a common vertex.\n2.  Construct a **maximal matching**. A matching is maximal if it cannot be extended by adding any other edge from the graph. For this problem, you will construct the maximal matching using a specific greedy procedure: Iterate through a pre-defined list of edges, and for each edge, add it to $M$ if and only if it does not share an endpoint with any edge already in $M$.\n3.  The resulting vertex cover, which we will call $C_{approx}$, is formed by taking all endpoints of the edges in the maximal matching $M$.\n\nConsider an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ with the vertex set $V = \\{A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H\\}$ and the edge set $E = \\{(A,B), (A,C), (B,C), (C,D), (D,E), (D,F), (E,F), (F,G), (G,H)\\}$.\n\nTo construct the maximal matching, process the edges from the set $E$ in the following specific order:\n$(G,H), (F,G), (E,F), (D,F), (D,E), (C,D), (B,C), (A,C), (A,B)$.\n\nYour task is to calculate the approximation ratio for this particular execution. The approximation ratio is defined as the ratio of the size of the generated vertex cover to the size of the optimal vertex cover, i.e., $\\frac{|C_{approx}|}{\\tau(G)}$.\n\nCalculate this approximation ratio. Express your final answer as a decimal number rounded to two significant figures.", "solution": "We follow the specified greedy construction of a maximal matching. Initialize $M=\\emptyset$ and process edges in the given order, adding an edge if it shares no endpoint with any edge already in $M$.\n\n- Process $(G,H)$: add, so $M=\\{(G,H)\\}$ with used endpoints $\\{G,H\\}$.\n- $(F,G)$ shares $G$, so skip.\n- $(E,F)$ shares no endpoint with $\\{G,H\\}$, so add: $M=\\{(G,H),(E,F)\\}$ with used endpoints $\\{E,F,G,H\\}$.\n- $(D,F)$ shares $F$, so skip.\n- $(D,E)$ shares $E$, so skip.\n- $(C,D)$ shares no endpoint with $\\{E,F,G,H\\}$, so add: $M=\\{(G,H),(E,F),(C,D)\\}$ with used endpoints $\\{C,D,E,F,G,H\\}$.\n- $(B,C)$ shares $C$, so skip.\n- $(A,C)$ shares $C$, so skip.\n- $(A,B)$ shares no endpoint with current $M$, so add: $M=\\{(G,H),(E,F),(C,D),(A,B)\\}$ with used endpoints $\\{A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H\\}$.\n\nThus the maximal matching has size $|M|=4$, and the 2-approximation algorithm outputs the vertex cover $C_{approx}$ consisting of all endpoints of edges in $M$, hence $C_{approx}=V$ and\n$$\n|C_{approx}|=8.\n$$\n\nNext, compute the optimal vertex cover size $\\tau(G)$. A general lower bound is given by the size of a maximum matching $\\nu(G)$:\n$$\n\\tau(G)\\geq \\nu(G).\n$$\nSince we found a matching of size $4$, $\\nu(G)\\geq 4$, hence $\\tau(G)\\geq 4$.\n\nWe show $\\tau(G)\\geq 5$. The subgraph on $\\{A,B,C\\}$ is a triangle, so any vertex cover must include at least $2$ vertices from $\\{A,B,C\\}$. Similarly, the subgraph on $\\{D,E,F\\}$ is a triangle, so it must include at least $2$ vertices from $\\{D,E,F\\}$. If $\\tau(G)=4$, then the cover consists of exactly $2$ from $\\{A,B,C\\}$ and $2$ from $\\{D,E,F\\}$, leaving no vertex from $\\{G,H\\}$.

Finding the smallest possible set of nodes is computationally difficult. Therefore, the analyst uses a greedy approximation algorithm. The algorithm works as follows: repeatedly select the node that is connected to the greatest number of currently unsecured links. This node is added to the set of monitored nodes, and all links connected to it are now considered secured. This process continues until all links in the network are secured. In case of a tie for the greatest number of unsecured links, the node that comes first in alphabetical order is chosen.\n\nYour task is to determine the performance of this greedy algorithm for this specific network.

A vertex cover is a subset of vertices $C \\subseteq V$ such that every edge in $E$ has at least one endpoint in $C$. The goal is to find a vertex cover with the minimum possible number of vertices.\n\nThe proposed algorithm is as follows:\n1.  **Initialization**: Start with a given candidate set $C \\subseteq V$ which is guaranteed to be a vertex cover.\n2.  **Reduction Step**: While the current cover $C$ is not minimal (i.e., there exists a vertex $u \\in C$ such that $C \\setminus \\{u\\}$ is also a vertex cover), update $C$ to $C \\setminus \\{u\\}$ and repeat this step.\n3.  **Swap Step**: After the reduction step terminates, the current cover $C$ is minimal. The algorithm now searches for a 'swap'. A swap is defined by a pair of vertices $(u, v)$ where $u \\in C$ and $v \\in V \\setminus C$. If the new set $C' = (C \\setminus \\{u\\}) \\cup \\{v\\}$ is also a vertex cover, the algorithm performs the swap by setting $C \\leftarrow C'$ and returns to Step 2 to attempt further reductions.\n4.  **Termination**: If the current minimal cover $C$ has no possible reduction (by definition of completing Step 2) and no valid swap can be found in Step 3, the algorithm terminates and returns $C$ as its result.\n\nConsider a specific bipartite graph constructed as follows. The vertex set is partitioned into two disjoint sets, $A = \\{a_1, a_2\\}$ and $B = \\{b_1, b_2, b_3\\}$. An edge exists between a vertex from set $A$ and a vertex from set $B$ if and only if they are from different sets. Specifically, the graph is a complete bipartite graph $K_{2,3}$.\n\nThe algorithm is initialized with the starting vertex cover $C_0 = B = \\{b_1, b_2, b_3\\}$.\n\nYour task is to analyze the execution of this algorithm. Determine the size of the vertex cover returned by the algorithm. Then, determine the size of a true minimum vertex cover for this graph.\n\nExpress your answer as a pair of integers $(S_L, S_O)$, where $S_L$ is the size of the locally optimal cover returned by the algorithm, and $S_O$ is the size of the globally optimal (minimum) vertex cover.", "solution": "We analyze the algorithm on the graph $K_{2,3}$ with parts $A=\\{a_1,a_2\\}$ and $B=\\{b_1,b_2,b_3\\}$, initialized at $C_0=B=\\{b_1,b_2,b_3\\}$.\n\nStep 2 (Reduction): A cover $C$ is not minimal if there exists $u \\in C$ such that $C \\setminus \\{u\\}$ is still a vertex cover. Take any $u=b_j \\in C_0$. Consider $C_0\\setminus\\{b_j\\}=\\{b_1,b_2,b_3\\}\\setminus\\{b_j\\}$. The edges incident to $b_j$ are $(a_1,b_j)$ and $(a_2,b_j)$. Since $a_1,a_2 \\notin C_0\\setminus\\{b_j\\}$ and $b_j \\notin C_0\\setminus\\{b_j\\}$, each of these edges would have neither endpoint in $C_0\\setminus\\{b_j\\}$, so $C_0\\setminus\\{b_j\\}$ is not a vertex cover. Hence no $b_j$ can be removed, and $C_0$ is minimal. Therefore Step 2 terminates with $C=B$ of size $3$.\n\nStep 3 (Swap): A swap replaces some $u \\in C$ with some $v \\in V \\setminus C$ while preserving the vertex cover property. Here $C=B$ and $V\\setminus C=A$. Let $u=b_j$ and $v=a_i$, and define $C'=(C\\setminus\\{b_j\\})\\cup\\{a_i\\}$. Consider the edge $(a_k,b_j)$ where $\\{i,k\\}=\\{1,2\\}$. In $C'$, we have $a_k \\notin C'$ and $b_j \\notin C'$, so $(a_k,b_j)$ is uncovered. Therefore no such swap produces a vertex cover, and Step 3 finds no valid swap. The algorithm terminates and returns $C=B$ with size $S_L=3$.\n\nGlobal optimum: The set $A=\\{a_1,a_2\\}$ is a vertex cover, since every edge of $K_{2,3}$ is incident to a vertex in $A$, so there exists a vertex cover of size $2$. By Kőnig’s theorem (or the matching lower bound), the minimum vertex cover size equals the maximum matching size for bipartite graphs. In $K_{2,3}$, the maximum matching size is $2$ (match each $a_i$ to a distinct $b_j$), hence any vertex cover has size at least $2$. Since the cover $A$ attains size $2$, the minimum vertex cover size is $S_O=2$.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm returns a locally optimal cover of size $3$, while the globally optimal vertex cover has size $2$.
