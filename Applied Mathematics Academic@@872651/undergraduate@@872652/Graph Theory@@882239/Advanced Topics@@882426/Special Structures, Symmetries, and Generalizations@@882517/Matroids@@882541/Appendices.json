This exercise [@problem_id:1542076] demonstrates that making the locally optimal choice at each step leads to a globally optimal solution, a hallmark of optimization problems on matroids.", "problem": "A network architect is designing the backbone of a small, specialized computing cluster. The cluster consists of six server nodes, labeled A, B, C, D, E, and F. A set of potential high-bandwidth fiber optic links can be installed between certain pairs of nodes. The available links and their corresponding maximum data transfer rates (bandwidths) are listed below:\n\n- Link (A, B): 15 Gbps\n- Link (A, C): 5 Gbps\n- Link (A, F): 8 Gbps\n- Link (B, C): 10 Gbps\n- Link (B, D): 12 Gbps\n- Link (C, D): 4 Gbps\n- Link (C, E): 9 Gbps\n- Link (D, E): 14 Gbps\n- Link (E, F): 7 Gbps\n\nThe final network design requires that a subset of these links be activated. The chosen set of active links must satisfy two conditions: First, all six nodes must be connected, meaning it must be possible to send data between any two nodes by traversing a path of active links. Second, the network must contain no redundant paths or loops; that is, there must be exactly one unique path between any two nodes. The objective is to select the active links in such a way that the sum of their individual bandwidths is maximized.\n\nWhat is the maximum possible total bandwidth of the active links in the final network design? Express your answer in Gbps.", "solution": "The requirements “all nodes connected” and “no cycles” mean the active links must form a spanning tree on the six nodes. With six nodes, any spanning tree has exactly $6-1=5$ edges. To maximize the total bandwidth of the active links subject to this tree constraint, we must find a maximum-weight spanning tree. Using Kruskal’s algorithm adapted for maximum weight, we sort the links by decreasing bandwidth and insert them one by one, skipping any link that would create a cycle, until we have $5$ edges.\n\nOrder the links by bandwidth (from largest to smallest): $(A,B):15$, $(D,E):14$, $(B,D):12$, $(B,C):10$, $(C,E):9$, $(A,F):8$, $(E,F):7$, $(A,C):5$, $(C,D):4$. Start with no edges. Add $(A,B)$ to connect $A$ and $B$. Add $(D,E)$ to connect $D$ and $E$. Add $(B,D)$, which merges the components $\\{A,B\\}$ and $\\{D,E\\}$ into $\\{A,B,D,E\\}$ without forming a cycle. Add $(B,C)$ to include $C$, yielding the component $\\{A,B,C,D,E\\}$. The next candidate $(C,E)$ would create a cycle because $C$ and $E$ are already connected via the existing path $C$–$B$–$D$–$E$, so we skip it. The next candidate $(A,F)$ connects $F$ to the existing component without forming a cycle. At this point we have selected $5$ edges, so the spanning tree is complete. The selected edges are $(A,B)$, $(D,E)$, $(B,D)$, $(B,C)$, and $(A,F)$ with total bandwidth\n$$15+14+12+10+8=59.$$\n\nBy the cut optimality property underlying Kruskal’s algorithm, this construction yields a maximum-weight spanning tree. As an independent check, note that the five largest bandwidths are $15$, $14$, $12$, $10$, and $9$, but the corresponding edges contain a cycle, so at least one must be replaced by the next largest feasible edge $8$, giving an upper bound of $59$, which is achieved by the tree above. Therefore, the maximum possible total bandwidth is $59$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{59}$$", "id": "1542076"}, {"introduction": "Why do greedy algorithms work for problems like the one above?
