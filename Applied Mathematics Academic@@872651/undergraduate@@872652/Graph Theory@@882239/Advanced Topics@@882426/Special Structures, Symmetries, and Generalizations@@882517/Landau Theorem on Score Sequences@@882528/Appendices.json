Since there are no draws and each game awards exactly $1$ win to one team, the sum of all teams’ wins must equal $6$. Each team plays $3$ games, so each individual score must lie in $\\{0,1,2,3\\}$. The condition that the two top-performing teams have the same number of wins means the last two entries of the non-decreasing score sequence must be equal.\n\nCheck each option against these necessary conditions and realizability.\n\nOption A: $(0,1,2,3)$. The top two entries are $2$ and $3$, which are not equal, so this does not satisfy the stated condition.\n\nOption B: $(0,0,3,3)$. The sum is $0+0+3+3=6$, which matches $\\binom{4}{2}$. However, a team with $3$ wins must defeat every other team, including the other team with $3$ wins, which is impossible. Therefore, this sequence is not realizable.\n\nOption C: $(1,1,2,2)$. The sum is $1+1+2+2=6$, matching $\\binom{4}{2}$. The top two entries are equal ($2$ and $2$). To verify realizability, we can use Landau’s criterion: for a non-decreasing tournament score sequence $(s_{1},\\dots,s_{n})$, it is necessary and sufficient that $\\sum_{i=1}^{k}s_{i}\\geq\\binom{k}{2}$ for all $k$, with equality at $k=n$.
