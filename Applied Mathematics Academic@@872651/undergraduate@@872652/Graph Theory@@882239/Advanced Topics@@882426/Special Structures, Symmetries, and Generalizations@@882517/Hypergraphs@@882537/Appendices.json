A hypergraph is said to be $k$-uniform if every hyperedge connects exactly $k$ vertices. Furthermore, a $k$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices is called 'complete', denoted by $K_n^k$, if its set of hyperedges consists of every possible subset of $k$ vertices from the $n$ available vertices.\n\nConsider a model for a peer-to-peer network with 6 nodes. For a certain data validation protocol to succeed, a 'validation-set' consisting of exactly 4 distinct nodes must be formed. The system is designed such that any possible combination of 4 nodes can form a valid validation-set. This network structure can be perfectly modeled as a complete 4-uniform hypergraph on 6 vertices, $K_6^4$, where the nodes are the vertices and the validation-sets are the hyperedges.\n\nDetermine the total number of distinct validation-sets that can be formed in this network.", "solution": "The problem asks for the total number of distinct validation-sets in a network of 6 nodes, where each validation-set comprises exactly 4 nodes. The problem states that this setup is equivalent to finding the number of hyperedges in a complete 4-uniform hypergraph on 6 vertices, $K_6^4$.\n\nBy definition, a complete $k$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices, $K_n^k$, contains a hyperedge for every possible subset of $k$ vertices that can be chosen from the set of $n$ vertices.\n\nIn this problem, we are given:\n- The total number of vertices (nodes), $n=6$.\n- The size of each hyperedge (validation-set), $k=4$.\n\nThe task is to find the total number of such hyperedges. This is a combinatorial problem of finding the number of ways to choose a subset of size $k$ from a set of size $n$. This quantity is given by the binomial coefficient, denoted as $\\binom{n}{k}$.\n\nThe formula for the binomial coefficient is:\n$$ \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} $$\n\nSubstituting the given values $n=6$ and $k=4$ into the formula:\n$$ \\text{Number of validation-sets} = \\binom{6}{4} $$\n\nNow, we compute the value of the binomial coefficient:\n$$ \\binom{6}{4} = \\frac{6!}{4!(6-4)!} = \\frac{6!}{4!2!} $$\n\nTo simplify the calculation, we can expand the factorials. Recall that $6! = 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1$.\n$$ \\binom{6}{4} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4!}{4! \\times (2 \\times 1)} $$\n\nWe can cancel the $4!$ term from the numerator and the denominator:\n$$ \\binom{6}{4} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} $$\n$$ \\binom{6}{4} = \\frac{30}{2} $$\n$$ \\binom{6}{4} = 15 $$\n\nTherefore, there are 15 distinct ways to choose 4 nodes from a set of 6.
