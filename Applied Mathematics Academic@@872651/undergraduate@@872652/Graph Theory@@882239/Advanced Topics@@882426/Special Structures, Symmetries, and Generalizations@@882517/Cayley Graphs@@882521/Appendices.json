Given a group $G$ and a generating set $S$ for that group, the Cayley graph $\\text{Cay}(G, S)$ has a vertex for each element of $G$. An edge connects two vertices $g$ and $h$ if and only if $h = g \\cdot s$ for some generator $s \\in S$.\n\nA fundamental property of any Cayley graph is that it is *vertex-transitive*. A graph is defined as vertex-transitive if for any two of its vertices, say $u$ and $v$, there is a symmetry of the graph (a graph automorphism) that maps vertex $u$ to vertex $v$. A direct structural consequence of this high degree of symmetry is that every vertex in a vertex-transitive graph must have the same degree (i.e., the graph must be regular).\n\nGiven this information, one of the following common graphs cannot be represented as a Cayley graph, regardless of the choice of group or generating set.

A vertex-transitive graph must be regular because graph automorphisms preserve degrees: if for any two vertices $u$ and $v$ there exists an automorphism $\\phi$ with $\\phi(u)=v$, then $\\deg(u)=\\deg(\\phi(u))=\\deg(v)$, hence all vertices share the same degree. Therefore, any non-regular graph cannot be a Cayley graph.\n\nWe analyze each option:\n\nA. $C_5$ is $2$-regular and vertex-transitive.
