This first practice invites you to explore how vertex degrees serve as a simple yet powerful invariant for detecting breaks in symmetry, providing a clear illustration of what it means for a graph to \"look the same\" from every vertex.", "problem": "In graph theory, an automorphism of a simple graph $G=(V, E)$ is a permutation $\\phi$ of the vertex set $V$ such that any two vertices $u, v \\in V$ are adjacent if and only if $\\phi(u)$ and $\\phi(v)$ are adjacent.\n\nA graph $G$ is said to be **vertex-transitive** if for any two vertices $u, v \\in V$, there exists an automorphism $\\phi$ such that $\\phi(u) = v$. Intuitively, this means the graph \"looks the same\" from every vertex.\n\nSimilarly, a graph $G$ is **edge-transitive** if for any two edges $e_1, e_2 \\in E$, there exists an automorphism $\\phi$ that maps $e_1$ to $e_2$.

Hence any automorphism maps a vertex of degree $d$ to a vertex of degree $d$, and similarly it maps an edge with a given pattern of endpoint degrees to an edge with the same pattern.\n\nFor the path graph $P_{n}$ with $n>3$, the degree sequence has exactly two vertices of degree $1$ (the endpoints) and $n-2$ vertices of degree $2$ (the internal vertices). Since automorphisms preserve degree, any automorphism must map endpoints to endpoints and internal vertices to internal vertices. Therefore, there are at least two distinct vertex orbits under the automorphism group, so $P_{n}$ is not vertex-transitive. For edges, the two end edges each have one endpoint of degree $1$ and one of degree $2$, whereas every internal edge has both endpoints of degree $2$. Because automorphisms preserve the degrees of endpoints, the end edges cannot be mapped to internal edges. Hence $P_{n}$ is not edge-transitive either.\n\nFor the cycle graph $C_{n}$ with $n>3$, every vertex has degree $2$, and every edge is structurally identical up to rotation or reflection. Define, for each $k \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,n-1\\}$, the permutation $\\rho_{k}$ on the vertex set by $\\rho_{k}(v_{i})=v_{i+k}$ where indices are taken modulo $n$. Each $\\rho_{k}$ preserves adjacency, hence is an automorphism. Given any two vertices $u,v$, choose $k$ so that $\\rho_{k}(u)=v$; thus the action is transitive on vertices and $C_{n}$ is vertex-transitive. For edges, label edges $e_{i}=\\{v_{i},v_{i+1}\\}$ with indices modulo $n$. Then $\\rho_{k}(e_{i})=e_{i+k}$, so for any two edges $e_{i},e_{j}$ there exists $k$ with $\\rho_{k}(e_{i})=e_{j}$; hence $C_{n}$ is edge-transitive as well.\n\nTherefore, for $n>3$, $P_{n}$ is not vertex-transitive, while $C_{n}$ is vertex-transitive.

A key question in network design is whether all nodes and all links are structurally equivalent, which corresponds to vertex- and edge-transitivity. This problem is particularly insightful because it reveals that these two properties are not equivalent; a network can have uniform links without having uniform nodes. Working through this problem [@problem_id:1553797] will clarify the distinct conditions under which each type of symmetry holds.", "problem": "In the design of a distributed computing architecture, a specific network topology is proposed. The network consists of two distinct types of nodes: $m$ servers and $n$ clients, where $m$ and $n$ are integers such that $m \\ge 1$ and $n \\ge 1$. The connectivity rules are simple: every server is connected to every client, and there are no connections between nodes of the same type (i.e., no server-to-server or client-to-client links).\n\nTwo key properties related to the symmetry of this network are being investigated:\n\n1.  **Node-Uniformity**: A network is said to be node-uniform if, for any two nodes $u$ and $v$ in the network (regardless of their type), the network's structure appears identical from the perspective of both nodes. Formally, this means the graph representing the network is vertex-transitive: for any two vertices $u$ and $v$, there exists a graph automorphism (a permutation of vertices that preserves adjacency) that maps $u$ to $v$.\n\n2.  **Link-Uniformity**: A network is said to be link-uniform if all communication links are structurally equivalent.

By construction, edges exist exactly between $S$ and $C$, and there are no edges within $S$ or within $C$.\n\nNode-uniformity (vertex-transitivity):\n1) A basic invariant under any graph automorphism is vertex degree. If $\\varphi$ is an automorphism and $u$ a vertex, then $\\deg(u)=\\deg(\\varphi(u))$.\n2) In $K_{m,n}$, for any $s\\in S$, $\\deg(s)=n$, and for any $c\\in C$, $\\deg(c)=m$.\n3) If $m\\neq n$, then vertices in $S$ and $C$ have different degrees. Hence no automorphism can map a vertex in $S$ to a vertex in $C$. Therefore the graph cannot be vertex-transitive, since vertex-transitivity requires that for any $u$ and $v$ (possibly from different parts) there exists an automorphism sending $u$ to $v$. Thus, a necessary condition for vertex-transitivity is $m=n$.\n4) If $m=n$, then all vertices have the same degree $n$. To show sufficiency, construct automorphisms:\n   - For any permutation $\\sigma\\in S_{m}$, extend it to an automorphism of $K_{n,n}$ by permuting vertices within $S$ according to $\\sigma$ and fixing $C$. Similarly, any $\\tau\\in S_{n}$ induces an automorphism by permuting within $C$ and fixing $S$. These act transitively on vertices within each part.\n   - To map across parts, fix a bijection $f:S\\to C$ (possible since $m=n$) and define $\\phi$ by $\\phi(s)=f(s)$ for $s\\in S$ and $\\phi(c)=f^{-1}(c)$ for $c\\in C$. For any edge $\\{s,c\\}$ with $s\\in S$, $c\\in C$, $\\phi(s)\\in C$ and $\\phi(c)\\in S$, and since every pair across parts is adjacent in $K_{n,n}$, adjacency is preserved. Thus $\\phi$ is an automorphism swapping the parts, and combined with within-part permutations it follows that for any two vertices $u,v$ there exists an automorphism sending $u$ to $v$.\nTherefore, $K_{m,n}$ is vertex-transitive if and only if $m=n$.\n\nLink-uniformity (edge-transitivity):\n1) Every edge of $K_{m,n}$ is of the form $\\{s,c\\}$ with $s\\in S$ and $c\\in C$.\n2) Consider any two edges $e_{1}=\\{s_{1},c_{1}\\}$ and $e_{2}=\\{s_{2},c_{2}\\}$ with $s_{1},s_{2}\\in S$ and $c_{1},c_{2}\\in C$. Choose any permutation $\\sigma\\in S_{m}$ sending $s_{1}$ to $s_{2}$ and any permutation $\\tau\\in S_{n}$ sending $c_{1}$ to $c_{2}$. Define $\\psi$ to act as $\\sigma$ on $S$ and as $\\tau$ on $C$.\n3) The map $\\psi$ preserves the bipartition and maps cross-part pairs to cross-part pairs; hence it preserves adjacency. Therefore $\\psi$ is a graph automorphism with $\\psi(e_{1})=e_{2}$.\n4) Since $e_{1}$ and $e_{2}$ were arbitrary, the automorphism group acts transitively on edges for all $m,n\\ge 1$.\nTherefore, $K_{m,n}$ is edge-transitive for all $m,n\\ge 1$.\n\nCombining both results, the network is node-uniform if and only if $m=n$, and it is always link-uniform for any $m,n\\ge 1$.

The properties of vertex-transitivity and edge-transitivity are defined based on the existence of such automorphisms.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the vertex-transitivity of the graph $G$.\nA graph is vertex-transitive if, for any two vertices $u$ and $v$, there is an automorphism $\\phi$ such that $\\phi(u) = v$. A necessary condition for a graph to be vertex-transitive is that all its vertices must have the same degree. This is because an automorphism preserves the local structure of a vertex, and the degree (the number of incident edges) is the most basic local property.\n\nLet's calculate the degrees of the vertices in graph $G$.\nThe graph $G$ has vertices $\\{a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4\\}$.\nThe edges within $C_4^{(A)}$ are $(a_1, a_2), (a_2, a_3), (a_3, a_4), (a_4, a_1)$.\nThe edges within $C_4^{(B)}$ are $(b_1, b_2), (b_2, b_3), (b_3, b_4), (b_4, b_1)$.\nThe bridge edge is $(a_1, b_1)$.\n\nLet's compute the degree, $\\deg(v)$, for each vertex $v$:\n- For vertex $a_1$: It is connected to $a_2$, $a_4$ (in $C_4^{(A)}$) and to $b_1$ (the bridge). Thus, $\\deg(a_1) = 3$.\n- For vertices $a_2, a_3, a_4$: Each is connected to two neighbors within $C_4^{(A)}$. For example, $a_2$ is connected to $a_1$ and $a_3$. Thus, $\\deg(a_2) = \\deg(a_3) = \\deg(a_4) = 2$.\n- For vertex $b_1$: It is connected to $b_2$, $b_4$ (in $C_4^{(B)}$) and to $a_1$ (the bridge). Thus, $\\deg(b_1) = 3$.\n- For vertices $b_2, b_3, b_4$: Each is connected to two neighbors within $C_4^{(B)}$.

For instance, there cannot be an automorphism mapping the vertex $a_1$ (degree 3) to the vertex $a_2$ (degree 2). Therefore, the graph $G$ is not vertex-transitive.\n\nNext, let's analyze the edge-transitivity of the graph $G$.\nA graph is edge-transitive if, for any two edges $e_1$ and $e_2$, there is an automorphism $\\phi$ such that $\\phi(e_1) = e_2$. A useful property to check for edge-transitivity is the pair of degrees of the vertices at the ends of an edge. An automorphism must map an edge to another edge whose endpoints have the same degrees (as a multiset).\n\nLet's examine the edges of $G$:\n1. The bridge edge, $e_{\\text{bridge}} = (a_1, b_1)$. The degrees of its endpoints are $\\deg(a_1) = 3$ and $\\deg(b_1) = 3$. So the endpoint degree pair is $\\{3, 3\\}$.\n2.

The endpoint degree pair is $\\{2, 3\\}$.\n3. The edges not adjacent to the bridge connection points, for example, $e_{\\text{far}} = (a_2, a_3)$. The degrees of its endpoints are $\\deg(a_2) = 2$ and $\\deg(a_3) = 2$. The endpoint degree pair is $\\{2, 2\\}$.\n\nThe edges in the graph fall into at least three distinct classes based on the degrees of their endpoints:\n- Class 1: Edges with endpoint degrees $\\{3, 3\\}$. This class contains only the bridge edge $(a_1, b_1)$.\n- Class 2: Edges with endpoint degrees $\\{2, 3\\}$. This class contains the edges $(a_1, a_2), (a_1, a_4), (b_1, b_2), (b_1, b_4)$.\n- Class 3: Edges with endpoint degrees $\\{2, 2\\}$. This class contains the edges $(a_2, a_3), (a_3, a_4), (b_2, b_3), (b_3, b_4)$.\n\nSince an automorphism must preserve endpoint degrees, an edge from one class cannot be mapped to an edge from another class. For example, there is no automorphism that can map the bridge edge $e_{\\text{bridge}}$ (type $\\{3, 3\\}$) to the edge $e_{\\text{adj}}$ (type $\\{2, 3\\}$). Because the set of edges is partitioned into at least three orbits under the action of the automorphism group, the graph is not edge-transitive.\n\nSince $G$ is neither vertex-transitive nor edge-transitive, the correct statement is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1553782"}]}
