A basis is a maximal independent set. For a partition matroid, all bases have the same size, which is called the rank of the matroid, given by $r(M) = \\sum_i d_i$.\nIn this case, the rank is $r(M) = d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4$.

The greedy algorithm for finding a maximum weight basis in a matroid proceeds by sorting elements in nonincreasing order of weight and adding each element if it maintains independence, stopping when a basis (maximal independent set) is obtained.\n\nFirst, determine the rank of $M$. Since $v_{1}=(1,0)$ and $v_{3}=(0,1)$ are linearly independent, the span of $E$ has dimension $2$, so the matroid rank is $r(M)=2$. Therefore, any basis has exactly $2$ vectors.\n\nOrder the vectors by weight in nonincreasing order:\n$$\nw(v_{4})=10,\\quad w(v_{3})=8,\\quad w(v_{1})=5,\\quad w(v_{2})=3.\n$$\nApply the greedy algorithm:\n- Initialize $S=\\varnothing$.\n- Consider $v_{4}$: add it since $S\\cup\\{v_{4}\\}$ is independent.

As a consistency check, note its total weight is $w(v_{3})+w(v_{4})=8+10=18$, which is larger than the total weight of any other independent pair listed among the options.
