A graph in this model consists of a set of $n$ vertices, and each of the $\\binom{n}{2}$ possible edges is present independently with probability $p$.\n\nA key concept in this field is the notion of a 'phase transition', where the qualitative structure of the graph changes abruptly as the edge probability $p$ crosses a certain threshold. The appearance of small subgraphs is a classic example of such a transition.\n\nConsider a specific non-trivial tree structure on 5 vertices, which we will call the \"Forked Path\" tree. It is constructed from a path on four vertices, labeled sequentially as $v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4$, by adding a fifth vertex, $v_5$, and connecting it to one of the internal vertices of the path, for instance, $v_2$. The resulting graph has edges $(v_1, v_2), (v_2, v_3), (v_3, v_4)$, and $(v_2, v_5)$.\n\nThe emergence of this Forked Path tree in $G(n,p)$ is governed by a threshold. For an introductory analysis, a precise way to characterize this threshold is to determine the function $p(n)$ for which the expected number of copies of the Forked Path tree in $G(n,p)$ is exactly equal to 1.\n\nYour task is to find this probability function $p(n)$.

In $G(n,p)$, for each injective embedding $f:V(H)\\to [n]$, the indicator that all $e$ edges of $H$ appear has expectation $p^{e}$. The number of injective embeddings is $(n)_{5}=n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)(n-4)$. Each unlabeled copy of $H$ in $G(n,p)$ corresponds to $|\\operatorname{Aut}(H)|$ labeled embeddings, so the expected number of (unlabeled) copies is\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X_{H}]=\\frac{(n)_{5}}{|\\operatorname{Aut}(H)|}\\,p^{4}.\n$$\nWe compute $|\\operatorname{Aut}(H)|$.

To model this, the connection probability is set as a function of the total number of nodes, $p = c/n$, where $c$ is a positive, dimensionless constant that represents the average degree of a node.\n\nIn the limit as the number of nodes becomes very large ($n \\to \\infty$), the expected fraction of nodes that are isolated converges to a value that depends only on the constant $c$.
