Let $H$ be the \"House Graph,\" defined as a simple graph on five vertices $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5\\}$ with the edge set $E = \\{(v_1, v_2), (v_2, v_3), (v_3, v_4), (v_4, v_1), (v_1, v_5), (v_2, v_5)\\}$.\n\nLet $\\text{ex}(n, H)$ denote the maximum number of edges in a graph with $n$ vertices that does not contain $H$ as a subgraph. For large values of $n$, this function has the asymptotic behavior $\\text{ex}(n, H) \\sim C n^2$, where $C$ is a constant. Determine the exact value of this constant $C$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the constant $C$ in the asymptotic formula for the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex graph that is free of the House Graph $H$, denoted $\\text{ex}(n, H)$. This is a classic problem in extremal graph theory, and its solution relies on the fundamental Erdős-Stone theorem.\n\nThe Erdős-Stone theorem states that for any graph $H$ with at least one edge, the maximum number of edges in an $H$-free graph on $n$ vertices is given by:\n$$ \\text{ex}(n, H) = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\chi(H)-1} + o(1)\\right) \\frac{n^2}{2} $$\nwhere $\\chi(H)$ is the chromatic number of the graph $H$, and the $o(1)$ term represents a quantity that approaches zero as $n \\to \\infty$. This formula is valid for any non-bipartite graph $H$ (i.e., $\\chi(H) \\ge 3$). If $H$ is bipartite ($\\chi(H)=2$), the number of edges is of a smaller order, $\\text{ex}(n, H) = o(n^2)$.\n\nTo apply this theorem, we must first determine the chromatic number of the given House Graph, $H$. The House Graph is defined on vertices $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5\\}$ with edges $E = \\{(v_1, v_2), (v_2, v_3), (v_3, v_4), (v_4, v_1), (v_1, v_5), (v_2, v_5)\\}$.\n\nFirst, we establish a lower bound for $\\chi(H)$. The vertices $\\{v_1, v_2, v_5\\}$ form a triangle, since the edges $(v_1, v_2)$, $(v_1, v_5)$, and $(v_2, v_5)$ are all present in the edge set $E$. A graph containing a triangle (a 3-clique) cannot be colored with fewer than 3 colors. Therefore, $\\chi(H) \\ge 3$.\n\nNext, we establish an upper bound by attempting to color the graph with 3 colors. If we succeed, we can conclude that $\\chi(H) = 3$. Let the available colors be {1, 2, 3}.\n1. We start with the triangle on $\\{v_1, v_2, v_5\\}$. We must assign a different color to each of these vertices. Let's set the coloring as follows:\n   - $c(v_1) = 1$\n   - $c(v_2) = 2$\n   - $c(v_5) = 3$\n2. Now, we must color the remaining vertices, $v_3$ and $v_4$.\n3. Consider vertex $v_3$. It is adjacent to $v_2$ (colored 2) and $v_4$. We can assign a color different from color 2, for example, color 1. So, let $c(v_3) = 1$.\n4. Finally, consider vertex $v_4$. It is adjacent to $v_1$ (colored 1) and $v_3$ (colored 1). Since both its neighbors are colored with color 1, we are free to assign any other color. Let's choose color 2. So, let $c(v_4) = 2$.\n5. We have now assigned a color to every vertex: $c(v_1)=1, c(v_2)=2, c(v_3)=1, c(v_4)=2, c(v_5)=3$. We must verify that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n   - $(v_1, v_2) \\to (1, 2)$: OK\n   - $(v_2, v_3) \\to (2, 1)$: OK\n   - $(v_3, v_4) \\to (1, 2)$: OK\n   - $(v_4, v_1) \\to (2, 1)$: OK\n   - $(v_1, v_5) \\to (1, 3)$: OK\n   - $(v_2, v_5) \\to (2, 3)$: OK\nSince we have found a valid 3-coloring, we have shown that $\\chi(H) \\le 3$.\n\nCombining our lower and upper bounds, we conclude that the chromatic number of the House Graph is exactly $\\chi(H) = 3$.\n\nNow we can substitute this value into the Erdős-Stone theorem formula:\n$$ \\text{ex}(n, H) = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3-1}\\right) \\frac{n^2}{2} + o(n^2) $$\n$$ \\text{ex}(n, H) = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\frac{n^2}{2} + o(n^2) $$\n$$ \\text{ex}(n, H) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\frac{n^2}{2} + o(n^2) $$\n$$ \\text{ex}(n, H) = \\frac{1}{4} n^2 + o(n^2) $$\n\nThe problem states that for large $n$, $\\text{ex}(n, H) \\sim C n^2$. This is equivalent to saying $\\text{ex}(n, H) = C n^2 + o(n^2)$. By comparing this with our derived expression, we can identify the constant $C$.\n$$ C n^2 = \\frac{1}{4} n^2 $$\nTherefore, the value of the constant is $C = \\frac{1}{4}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{4}}$$", "id": "1540704"}, {"introduction": "While the Erdős-Stone theorem gives a precise asymptotic density for $H$-free graphs when $H$ is not bipartite, its behavior changes dramatically for bipartite graphs.

Which of the following statements is a correct deduction that highlights a key aspect of the theorem's application to bipartite graphs?\n\nA. The Erdős-Stone theorem is incorrect for bipartite graphs because it predicts $ex(n, H)=0$, which is false for any non-empty graph $H$.\n\nB. The Erdős-Stone theorem implies that for any two bipartite graphs $H_1$ and $H_2$, the ratio $ex(n, H_1) / ex(n, H_2)$ approaches 1 as $n \\to \\infty$.\n\nC. The leading term in the Erdős-Stone formula evaluates to zero for bipartite graphs, so the theorem only provides the information that $ex(n, H) = o(n^2)$, failing to distinguish between different sub-quadratic growth rates like $n^{3/2}$ and $n^{5/3}$.\n\nD. The chromatic number for $C_4$ and $K_{3,3}$ must be larger than 2, but the difference is so small it is not captured by the integer-valued function $\\chi(H)$, leading to the discrepancy.\n\nE. The $o(n^2)$ term in the Erdős-Stone theorem is universally of the order $O(n^{2-\\epsilon})$ for some fixed $\\epsilon > 0$ that is independent of the specific bipartite graph $H$, which contradicts the specific results for $C_4$ and $K_{3,3}$.", "solution": "By the Erdős-Stone theorem, for any graph $H$ with at least one edge,\n$$\nex(n,H)=\\left(1-\\frac{1}{\\chi(H)-1}\\right)\\binom{n}{2}+o(n^{2}).\n$$\nIf $H$ is bipartite, then $\\chi(H)=2$, so\n$$\n1-\\frac{1}{\\chi(H)-1}=1-\\frac{1}{2-1}=1-1=0,\n$$\nand hence the theorem yields\n$$\nex(n,H)=0\\cdot\\binom{n}{2}+o(n^{2})=o(n^{2}).\n$$\nThis shows that for bipartite $H$, the theorem provides only the subquadratic upper order $o(n^{2})$ without specifying the precise subquadratic exponent.\n\nThe refined results stated are\n$$\nex(n,C_{4})\\sim c_{1}n^{3/2},\\qquad ex(n,K_{3,3})\\sim c_{2}n^{5/3},\n$$\nwhich both satisfy $ex(n,H)=o(n^{2})$ since\n$$\n\\frac{n^{3/2}}{n^{2}}=n^{-1/2}\\to 0,\\qquad \\frac{n^{5/3}}{n^{2}}=n^{-1/3}\\to 0\n$$\nas $n\\to\\infty$.

For bipartite $H$ the theorem gives $ex(n,H)=o(n^{2})$, not $ex(n,H)=0$.\n\nB. Incorrect. The theorem does not compare different bipartite graphs’ extremal numbers.

Correct. When $\\chi(H)=2$, the leading term vanishes, and the theorem only asserts $ex(n,H)=o(n^{2})$, which does not distinguish among different subquadratic rates such as $n^{3/2}$ and $n^{5/3}$.\n\nD. Incorrect. Both $C_{4}$ and $K_{3,3}$ are bipartite with $\\chi(H)=2$.\n\nE. Incorrect. The theorem’s $o(n^{2})$ term is not asserted to be uniformly $O(n^{2-\\epsilon})$ for a fixed $\\epsilon>0$ independent of $H$.

This problem provides a hands-on look at this phenomenon by constructing a graph that is a small perturbation of a complete bipartite graph (a Turán graph $T(n,2)$) and asking you to count the number of triangles ($K_3$) that are created by these \"error\" edges [@problem_id:1540715].", "problem": "In extremal graph theory, the Erdős-Stone theorem provides a fundamental link between the number of edges in a graph and the subgraphs it must contain.
