For any integers $s, t > 2$, the inequality is given by:\n$$R(s, t) \\le R(s-1, t) + R(s, t-1)$$\nIt is also known that for any integer $n \\ge 2$, the Ramsey numbers involving 2 are trivial, following the rule $R(n, 2) = n$.\n\nA computer program is tasked with finding an upper bound for $R(3, 5)$.

The color of an edge $\\{u, v\\}$ depends on the value $d = \\min(|u-v|, 8-|u-v|)$. This value $d$ represents the shortest distance between vertices $u$ and $v$ if they are arranged on a circle.

Let's try to find a red clique of size 3 (a red triangle).\n\nDue to the cyclic symmetry of the coloring rule, we can choose one vertex to be 0 without loss of generality. Let's try to form a red triangle $\\{0, v_1, v_2\\}$. For this to be a red triangle, the edges $\\{0, v_1\\}$, $\\{0, v_2\\}$, and $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$ must all be red.\n\n1.  The edges $\\{0, v_1\\}$ and $\\{0, v_2\\}$ must be red. This means the distances from 0 to $v_1$ and from 0 to $v_2$ must be in $\\{1, 4\\}$. The vertices at distance 1 from 0 are 1 and 7. The vertex at distance 4 from 0 is 4. So, $v_1, v_2$ must be chosen from the set $\\{1, 4, 7\\}$, which is the set of red neighbors of vertex 0.\n\n2.  Let's check the edge between any pair of these neighbors.\n    -   Consider the pair $\\{1, 4\\}$. The distance is $d = \\min(|4-1|, 8-|4-1|) = \\min(3, 5) = 3$. An edge with distance 3 is blue. So $\\{0, 1, 4\\}$ is not a red triangle.\n    -   Consider the pair $\\{1, 7\\}$. The distance is $d = \\min(|7-1|, 8-|7-1|) = \\min(6, 2) = 2$. An edge with distance 2 is blue. So $\\{0, 1, 7\\}$ is not a red triangle.\n    -   Consider the pair $\\{4, 7\\}$. The distance is $d = \\min(|7-4|, 8-|7-4|) = \\min(3, 5) = 3$. An edge with distance 3 is blue. So $\\{0, 4, 7\\}$ is not a red triangle.\n\nSince no red neighbor of 0 forms a red edge with another red neighbor of 0, there are no red triangles containing vertex 0. By symmetry, this holds for any vertex. Therefore, there are no red triangles ($K_3$) in the graph.\n\nThe largest red clique cannot have size 3 or more. A single red edge, like $\\{0, 1\\}$, forms a red clique of size 2. Thus, the size of the largest red clique is $\\omega_{red} = 2$.\n\n**Part 2: Finding the size of the largest blue clique ($\\omega_{blue}$)**\n\nA blue clique is a set of vertices where the distance $d$ between any two vertices in the set is either 2 or 3.\n\nLet's first check for a blue clique of size 3 (a blue triangle). Again, let's start with vertex 0.\nA blue triangle containing 0 would be of the form $\\{0, v_1, v_2\\}$, where the distances $d(0, v_1)$, $d(0, v_2)$, and $d(v_1, v_2)$ are all in $\\{2, 3\\}$.\nThe blue neighbors of 0 are the vertices at distance 2 or 3.\n- Vertices at distance 2: $\\{2, 6\\}$.\n- Vertices at distance 3: $\\{3, 5\\}$.\nThe set of blue neighbors of 0 is $N_B(0) = \\{2, 3, 5, 6\\}$.\nLet's pick $v_1 = 2$. Then $d(0, 2) = 2$ (blue). We need to find $v_2 \\in N_B(0)$ such that $d(2, v_2)$ is also blue.\n- Let's try $v_2 = 5$. The distance is $d(2, 5) = \\min(|5-2|, 8-|5-2|) = \\min(3, 5) = 3$. This is a blue distance.\nSo, for the set $\\{0, 2, 5\\}$, we have $d(0,2)=2$ (blue), $d(0,5)=3$ (blue), and $d(2,5)=3$ (blue). All three edges are blue.\nTherefore, $\\{0, 2, 5\\}$ is a blue triangle. This means $\\omega_{blue} \\ge 3$.\n\nNow let's check for a blue clique of size 4 (a blue $K_4$).\nLet's assume a blue $K_4$ exists. By symmetry, we can assume it contains vertex 0. Let the clique be $\\{0, v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$.\nThis implies that $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$ must be a blue triangle ($K_3$) within the blue neighborhood of 0, which is $N_B(0) = \\{2, 3, 5, 6\\}$.\nSo, we must find a subset of 3 vertices in $\\{2, 3, 5, 6\\}$ where all pairwise distances are in $\\{2, 3\\}$.\n\nLet's check the distances between all pairs of vertices in $\\{2, 3, 5, 6\\}$:\n- $d(2, 3) = \\min(|3-2|, 8-1) = 1$. Red.\n- $d(2, 5) = \\min(|5-2|, 8-3) = 3$. Blue.\n- $d(2, 6) = \\min(|6-2|, 8-4) = 4$. Red.\n- $d(3, 5) = \\min(|5-3|, 8-2) = 2$. Blue.\n- $d(3, 6) = \\min(|6-3|, 8-3) = 3$. Blue.\n- $d(5, 6) = \\min(|6-5|, 8-1) = 1$. Red.\n\nThe blue edges within the induced subgraph on $\\{2, 3, 5, 6\\}$ are $\\{2, 5\\}, \\{3, 5\\}, \\{3, 6\\}$. These three edges form a path $2-5-3-6$. There is no set of three vertices among $\\{2, 3, 5, 6\\}$ that are all mutually connected by blue edges.\nTherefore, there is no blue triangle in the blue neighborhood of 0. This implies there is no blue $K_4$ containing 0. By symmetry, there is no blue $K_4$ in the entire graph.\n\nSince we found a blue clique of size 3, but showed that no blue clique of size 4 exists, the size of the largest blue clique is $\\omega_{blue} = 3$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWe have found that $\\omega_{red} = 2$ and $\\omega_{blue} = 3$.
