The $k$-SAT problem is a cornerstone of computational complexity theory, and showing that a solution *exists* without actually finding it is a classic example of the probabilistic method's power. This exercise demonstrates how the LLL provides a concrete condition on the structure of a $k$-SAT formula that guarantees it is satisfiable [@problem_id:1544349].", "problem": "A $k$-satisfiability ($k$-SAT) formula is a Boolean expression composed of a conjunction of clauses, where each clause is the disjunction of exactly $k$ distinct literals (a variable or its negation). The formula is satisfiable if there exists an assignment of 'true' or 'false' to the variables that makes the entire formula evaluate to 'true'.\n\nTo prove the existence of a satisfying assignment using a probabilistic approach, we consider a random assignment where each variable is independently set to 'true' with probability 1/2 and 'false' with probability 1/2. We define a 'bad event' for each clause, corresponding to that clause not being satisfied by the random assignment. If we can show that the probability of no bad events occurring is greater than zero, then a satisfying assignment must exist.\n\nThe Symmetric Lovász Local Lemma provides a powerful tool for such proofs. It states: Let $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_m$ be a set of events. Suppose that for each $i$, the probability $\\Pr(A_i) \\leq p$, and the event $A_i$ is mutually independent of all other events except for a set of at most $d$ of them.

While standard graph coloring ensures no two connected vertices share a color, hypergraph coloring extends this to larger sets of vertices, known as hyperedges. This problem challenges you to use the LLL to find a condition on the 'local density' of a hypergraph that guarantees a 2-coloring exists, preventing any hyperedge from being monochromatic [@problem_id:1490022].", "problem": "Let $\\mathcal{H}=(V,E)$ be a hypergraph, where $V$ is a set of vertices and $E$ is a set of hyperedges, with each hyperedge being a non-empty subset of $V$. The hypergraph $\\mathcal{H}$ is called $k$-uniform if every hyperedge in $E$ has a size of exactly $k$. A 2-coloring of $\\mathcal{H}$ is an assignment of one of two colors (say, red or blue) to each vertex in $V$ such that no hyperedge is monochromatic (i.e., no hyperedge has all its vertices of the same color).\n\nIt can be shown using a probabilistic method that a $k$-uniform hypergraph is guaranteed to be 2-colorable if a certain condition on its structure is met. Specifically, for any hyperedge $e \\in E$, let $N(e)$ be the set of other hyperedges that have a non-empty intersection with $e$, so $N(e) = \\{e' \\in E \\setminus \\{e\\} \\mid e \\cap e' \\neq \\emptyset\\}$.

Instead of demanding a perfect coloring, we often seek a 'good-enough' solution, such as a defective coloring where a limited number of conflicts are tolerated. This exercise asks you to find conditions guaranteeing a coloring where no vertex has more than a specified number of neighbors of the same color, a practical problem in areas like wireless network design [@problem_id:1544335].", "problem": "In the design of wireless communication networks, nodes (vertices) must be assigned operating frequencies (colors) from a given set. To minimize local interference, it is desirable that any single node does not share its frequency with too many of its direct neighbors.

A vertex coloring $C: V \\to \\{1, 2, \\dots, k\\}$ is called an **$m$-defective coloring** if for every vertex $v \\in V$, the number of neighbors of $v$ that have the same color as $v$ is at most $m$, where $m$ is a non-negative integer. You are tasked with determining how many frequencies $k$ are sufficient to guarantee such an assignment is possible.\n\nTo solve this, you will use the **Symmetric Lovász Local Lemma (LLL)**, which states: Let $A_1, \\dots, A_n$ be a set of 'bad' events in a probability space. Suppose that for each $i$, the probability of the event is bounded by $\\Pr(A_i) \\leq p$, and that each event $A_i$ is mutually independent of all but at most $d$ other events $A_j$.

Let $X_{v}$ be the number of neighbors of $v$ that share $v$'s color.\n\nConditioned on the color of $v$, each neighbor independently matches $v$'s color with probability $1/k$. Hence $X_{v}$ is stochastically dominated by $B(\\Delta, 1/k)$, since $\\deg(v) \\leq \\Delta$.

The event $A_u$ depends on colors of $u$ and $N(u)$. They are independent if $(\\{v\\} \\cup N(v)) \\cap (\\{u\\} \\cup N(u)) = \\emptyset$.
