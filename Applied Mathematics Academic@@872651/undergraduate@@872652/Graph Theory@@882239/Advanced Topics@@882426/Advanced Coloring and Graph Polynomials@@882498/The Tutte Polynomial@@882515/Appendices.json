It is a two-variable polynomial that can be computed for any given graph $G$ by recursively applying a set of rules known as the deletion-contraction recurrence.\n\nThe rules are as follows:\n1.  If $G$ is a graph containing at least one edge $e$:\n    a. If the edge $e$ is a bridge (i.e., its removal increases the number of connected components of the graph), then $T_G(x,y) = x \\cdot T_{G-e}(x,y)$, where $G-e$ is the graph $G$ with edge $e$ deleted.\n    b. If the edge $e$ is a loop (i.e., an edge that connects a vertex to itself), then $T_G(x,y) = y \\cdot T_{G/e}(x,y)$, where $G/e$ is the graph $G$ with edge $e$ contracted.\n    c. If the edge $e$ is neither a bridge nor a loop, then $T_G(x,y) = T_{G-e}(x,y) + T_{G/e}(x,y)$.\n\n2.  If $G$ is a graph with no edges, its Tutte polynomial is $1$.\n\n3.  If a graph $G$ consists of two disconnected subgraphs $G_1$ and $G_2$ (i.e., $G = G_1 \\cup G_2$), then its Tutte polynomial is the product of the polynomials of its components: $T_G(x,y) = T_{G_1}(x,y) \\cdot T_{G_2}(x,y)$.\n\nA complete bipartite graph, $K_{m,n}$, is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets, one of size $m$ and the other of size $n$, such that every vertex in the first set is connected to every vertex in the second set, and there are no connections within the sets.\n\nUsing the rules defined above, determine the Tutte polynomial for the complete bipartite graph $K_{2,2}$. Express your final answer as a polynomial in variables $x$ and $y$.", "solution": "Let $G = K_{2,2}$. This graph is a $4$-cycle. Choose any edge $e$ of $G$. Since $e$ is neither a bridge nor a loop, by rule 1c,\n$$\nT_{G}(x,y) = T_{G-e}(x,y) + T_{G/e}(x,y).\n$$\nFirst, compute $T_{G-e}(x,y)$. The graph $G-e$ is a path on 4 vertices, $P_4$. Since $P_4$ is a tree with 3 edges, every edge is a bridge. For any tree $T$ with $n$ vertices, repeated application of rule 1a ($T_H(x,y) = x \\cdot T_{H/f}(x,y)$ for a bridge $f$) shows that $T_T(x,y) = x^{n-1}$. For $P_4$, we have $n=4$, so $T_{G-e}(x,y) = T_{P_4}(x,y) = x^{4-1} = x^3$.\n\nNext, compute $T_{G/e}(x,y)$. Contracting $e$ in the $4$-cycle yields the triangle $C_{3}$. Choose an edge $g$ of $C_{3}$; it is neither a bridge nor a loop, so by rule 1c,\n$$\nT_{C_{3}}(x,y) = T_{C_{3}-g}(x,y) + T_{C_{3}/g}(x,y).\n$$\nHere $C_{3}-g$ is the path on 3 vertices, $P_3$. As a tree with $n=3$ vertices, its Tutte polynomial is $T_{P_3}(x,y) = x^{3-1} = x^{2}$. The contraction $C_{3}/g$ is a multigraph with two parallel edges between two vertices; call it $M_2$. For $M_2$, pick one parallel edge $h$; it is neither a bridge nor a loop, hence\n$$\nT_{M_2}(x,y) = T_{M_2-h}(x,y) + T_{M_2/h}(x,y).\n$$\nNow $M_2-h$ is a single edge graph, $P_2$. As a tree with $n=2$ vertices, its polynomial is $T_{P_2}(x,y) = x^{2-1} = x$. And $M_2/h$ is a single vertex with one loop. By rule 1b, its polynomial is $y \\cdot T_{K_{1}}(x,y) = y \\cdot 1 = y$.\nThus $T_{M_2}(x,y) = x + y$, and consequently\n$$\nT_{C_{3}}(x,y) = x^{2} + (x + y) = x^{2} + x + y.\n$$\nPutting the parts together,\n$$\nT_{K_{2,2}}(x,y) = T_{G-e}(x,y) + T_{G/e}(x,y) = x^{3} + \\bigl(x^{2} + x + y\\bigr) = x^{3} + x^{2} + x + y.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{x^{3} + x^{2} + x + y}$$", "id": "1547666"}, {"introduction": "Beyond its recursive definition, the Tutte polynomial can also be expressed through a powerful state-sum formula over all subsets of edges.
