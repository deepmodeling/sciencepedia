By definition, two distinct vertices are siblings if they share the same parent.

For any other vertex, there is a unique simple path from the root to that vertex.

For any non-root vertex $v$ with parent $p$, the number of siblings of $v$ equals the number of children of $p$ minus one. Denote by $c(p)$ the number of children of $p$. Then the number of siblings of $v$ is\n$$\n\\text{siblings}(v) = c(p) - 1.\n$$\nTo maximize $\\text{siblings}(v)$ over all vertices in all rooted trees with $n$ vertices, we must maximize $c(p)$ for some parent $p$.\n\nObserve that $c(p)$ cannot exceed the number of vertices distinct from $p$. Hence,\n- If $p$ is the root, then $c(p) \\leq n - 1$, with equality realized by the rooted star where the root is adjacent to all other $n-1$ vertices (all are its children).\n- If $p$ is not the root, then $p$ has a parent, so there are at least $2$ vertices not among its children (namely $p$ and its parent), implying $c(p) \\leq n - 2$.\n\nTherefore, the global maximum of $c(p)$ is $n - 1$, achieved when $p$ is the root of a star.

This exercise presents a seemingly plausible design rule for a rooted tree and asks you to determine if it can be satisfied. To solve this, you must apply a fundamental principle linking the number of vertices, edges, and children, demonstrating how basic counting arguments can reveal deep constraints on graph structures.
