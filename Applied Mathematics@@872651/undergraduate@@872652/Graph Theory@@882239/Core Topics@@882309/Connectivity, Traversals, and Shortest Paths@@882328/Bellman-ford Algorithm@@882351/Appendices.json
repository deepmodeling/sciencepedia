Consider a directed graph representing a network where nodes are stable particle states and edges represent possible transitions. The weight of an edge $(u,v)$ corresponds to the energy change when a particle transitions from state $u$ to state $v$. A negative total weight around a cycle implies a physically anomalous situation where a particle could endlessly gain energy.\n\nThe network is defined by a set of states (vertices) `V = {S, A, B, C, D, E}` and a set of transitions (directed edges with weights). The state `S` is the initial state for all particles. The Bellman-Ford algorithm is used to analyze the energy landscape from state `S`.\n\nThe transitions and their energy changes are given as follows, in the canonical order used for relaxing edges in each iteration of the algorithm:\n1.
