The design consists of a main backbone and several local clusters.\n\nThe backbone is a high-speed fiber optic ring connecting $n=8$ primary data centers, labeled $c_1, c_2, \\dots, c_8$. Each data center $c_i$ is connected directly to its neighbors $c_{i-1}$ and $c_{i+1}$ (with indices taken cyclically, so $c_1$ is connected to $c_8$ and $c_2$).\n\nFrom each of these 8 primary data centers, a separate local cluster extends outwards. Each local cluster consists of a linear chain of 4 secondary offices. For the cluster attached to center $c_i$, the offices are labeled $o_{i,1}, o_{i,2}, o_{i,3}, o_{i,4}$. The connection topology is as follows: the primary data center $c_i$ is connected only to the first office $o_{i,1}$; $o_{i,1}$ is connected only to $c_i$ and $o_{i,2}$; $o_{i,2}$ is connected only to $o_{i,1}$ and $o_{i,3}$; and so on, up to $o_{i,4}$ which is connected only to $o_{i,3}$.\n\nThis entire network can be modeled as a single connected graph where data centers and offices are vertices, and communication links are edges. A link is defined as \"critical\" if its failure would disconnect the network into two or more separate components. In graph theory, such an edge is known as a bridge.\n\nHow many critical links are there in the entire network?", "solution": "Model the network as a graph. The backbone forms a cycle on the vertices $c_{1},\\dots,c_{8}$, specifically an $8$-cycle. A fundamental fact in graph theory is that no edge that lies on a cycle is a bridge, because removing such an edge leaves an alternative route along the remainder of the cycle connecting its endpoints; thus removal does not increase the number of connected components.\n\nFrom each $c_{i}$ a path of length $4$ edges extends: $c_{i}$–$o_{i,1}$–$o_{i,2}$–$o_{i,3}$–$o_{i,4}$. These edges do not lie on any cycle, since the only cycle in the graph is the backbone ring. Another standard fact is that any edge not contained in any cycle is a bridge; equivalently, every edge of a tree is a bridge. Therefore, for each $i$, the four edges $(c_i, o_{i,1})$, $(o_{i,1}, o_{i,2})$, $(o_{i,2}, o_{i,3})$, and $(o_{i,3}, o_{i,4})$ are bridges.\n\nThe backbone edges are not bridges, and all bridges are exactly the edges in these $8$ attached paths. Each path contributes $4$ bridges, and there are $8$ such paths, yielding\n$$8\\times 4=32.$$\nTherefore, there are $32$ critical links in the entire network.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{32}$$", "id": "1487134"}, {"introduction": "With the basic definition in hand, it's crucial to challenge common intuitions and misconceptions.

The network's topology is modeled as a simple, connected graph $G=(V, E)$, where the set of vertices $V$ represents data centers and the set of edges $E$ represents high-bandwidth fiber optic links. A link is considered a \"single point of failure\" if its removal would disconnect the network into two or more separate components. In graph theory, such an edge is called a bridge.\n\nThe architect is exploring various design constraints related to vertex degrees to enhance network resilience. The degree of a vertex is the number of links connected to it. The minimum degree of the graph, denoted $\\delta(G)$, is the smallest degree among all vertices in the graph. The architect wants to understand the fundamental relationship between the minimum degree of a network graph and the possible existence of bridges.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes this relationship for any simple, connected graph $G$ with at least two vertices?\n\nA.

Claim: “$G$ has no bridges if and only if $\\delta(G) \\geq 2$.” The forward direction is true: if $G$ has no bridges, then no vertex can have degree $1$, because if there were a vertex $u$ with $\\deg(u)=1$, its unique incident edge would be a bridge, a contradiction. Hence $\\delta(G) \\geq 2$. The reverse direction is false. Counterexample: take two cycles and connect them by a single edge. Formally, let $G$ be obtained from two disjoint cycles $C_{m}$ and $C_{n}$ by adding a single edge $xy$ where $x \\in V(C_{m})$ and $y \\in V(C_{n})$. Then $\\delta(G)=2$, but the added edge $xy$ is the only connection between the two parts, so $xy$ is a bridge. Therefore A is false.\n\nB. Claim: “If $G$ has a bridge, then $\\delta(G)=1$.” This is false. The same counterexample as above has a bridge $xy$ while $\\delta(G)=2$. Hence B is false.\n\nC. Claim: “For any integer $k \\geq 1$, there exists a connected graph $G$ with a bridge and $\\delta(G)=k$.” Construction: \n- For $k=1$, any tree on at least two vertices is connected, has bridges, and $\\delta(G)=1$.\n- For $k \\geq 2$, take two connected $k$-regular graphs (for instance, two copies of $K_{k+1}$, which is $k$-regular). Pick one vertex from each copy and add a single edge between them. The resulting graph is connected; the added edge is the only interconnection between the two copies, hence it is a bridge. The degrees of the chosen endpoints increase to $k+1$, while all other vertices still have degree $k$, so the minimum degree remains $\\delta(G)=k$. Thus C is true.\n\nD. Claim: “If an edge is a bridge, then at least one endpoint has degree $1$.” This is false. In the earlier construction with two cycles (or two triangles) connected by a single edge, the bridge’s endpoints have degree at least $2$ (indeed $3$ in the two-triangles example), not $1$. Hence D is false.\n\nE. Claim: “Any connected graph with $\\delta(G) \\geq 2$ contains no bridge.” This is the converse of the true implication in A and is disproved by the same counterexample used for A and B.
