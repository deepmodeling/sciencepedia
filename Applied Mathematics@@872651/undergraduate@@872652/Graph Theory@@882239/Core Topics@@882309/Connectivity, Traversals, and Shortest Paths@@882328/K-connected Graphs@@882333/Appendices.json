The swarm consists of a single 'command' drone and $N-1$ 'worker' drones, where the total number of drones is $N$, and it is given that $N \\ge 4$. The network topology is defined by the following communication links:\n\n1.  The command drone is connected to every one of the $N-1$ worker drones.\n2.  The worker drones are arranged logically in a ring, and each worker drone is connected to its two immediate neighbors in this ring.\n\nA failure of a drone corresponds to removing that drone and all its communication links from the network. The network is considered 'fragmented' if, after the removal of one or more drones, the remaining drones can be split into at least two groups with no communication paths between them, or if only a single drone remains.\n\nDetermine the vertex connectivity of this network, which is defined as the minimum number of drone failures required to fragment the network. Your answer should be a single integer.", "solution": "Let $G$ be the graph on $N$ vertices ($N \\ge 4$) consisting of one hub (the command drone) $h$ and $N-1$ rim vertices (the worker drones) forming a cycle $C_{N-1}$. The edge set is the union of all spokes $\\{h,r\\}$ for each rim vertex $r$ and the cycle edges among the rim vertices.\n\nWe seek the vertex connectivity $\\kappa(G)$, the minimum number of vertices whose removal disconnects $G$ or reduces it to a single vertex.\n\nFirst, observe the degrees: $\\deg(h) = N-1$ and each rim vertex has degree $3$ (two cycle neighbors and the hub). Hence the minimum degree is $\\delta(G) = 3$. By the general bound $\\kappa(G) \\le \\delta(G)$, we have\n$$\n\\kappa(G) \\le 3.\n$$\n\nWe now show that removing any set of at most two vertices leaves $G$ connected, which implies $\\kappa(G) \\ge 3$.\n\nCase 1: The hub $h$ is not removed. Then at most two rim vertices are removed. The remaining graph still contains $h$, which is adjacent to every remaining rim vertex. For any two remaining vertices $u$ and $v$, if either is $h$ there is an edge between them; if both are rim vertices, the path $u$–$h$–$v$ exists. Therefore the graph remains connected.\n\nCase 2: Exactly the hub $h$ is removed. The remaining graph is the cycle $C_{N-1}$, which is connected for $N-1 \\ge 3$ (i.e., $N \\ge 4$). Hence the graph remains connected.\n\nCase 3: The hub $h$ and exactly one rim vertex are removed. The remaining rim vertices induce $C_{N-1}$ with one vertex deleted, which is a path $P_{N-2}$ and therefore connected for $N-2 \\ge 2$ (i.e., $N \\ge 4$). Hence the graph remains connected.\n\nThus no removal of at most two vertices disconnects $G$, giving\n$$\n\\kappa(G) \\ge 3.\n$$\n\nTo show that three removals suffice, remove the hub $h$ and two rim vertices that are nonadjacent on the rim cycle. Removing two vertices from a cycle $C_{N-1}$ splits it into two disjoint paths, and with $h$ removed there are no spokes to reconnect these paths. Therefore the remaining graph has at least two components, so it is disconnected.

The edge set forms the cycle $C_{6}$ on vertices $\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$. In a cycle, no edge is a bridge since removing any single edge leaves a connected path; thus the graph is $2$-edge-connected.

Therefore, A is $2$-edge-connected but has no cut-vertex, so it does not satisfy the requirement.\n\nB. The edge set consists of a triangle on $\\{1,2,3\\}$ and a $4$-cycle on $\\{3,4,5,6\\}$ sharing the vertex $3$.

Let's test each vertex type in $G$.\n- Vertices $v_1, v_4, a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2$: These are all of degree 2 or less (in the case of $v_1, v_4$). Removing any of them (e.g., $v_1$) will not disconnect the remaining graph. For instance, removing $v_1$ leaves the rest of the graph connected through the path starting from $v_2$. Removing $a_1$ leaves $v_2$ and $a_2$ connected via their direct edge. So, these are not cut vertices.\n- Vertex $v_2$: The vertex $v_2$ connects the edge $(v_1, v_2)$, the edge $(v_2, v_3)$, and the triangle on $\\{v_2, a_1, a_2\\}$. If we remove $v_2$, the vertex $v_1$ becomes isolated from the rest of the graph. The vertices $a_1$ and $a_2$ are only connected to each other and are isolated from the rest. The path starting from $v_3$ is also a separate component. Therefore, removing $v_2$ disconnects the graph, making $v_2$ a cut vertex.\n- Vertex $v_3$: Similarly, $v_3$ connects the edge $(v_2, v_3)$, the edge $(v_3, v_4)$, and the triangle on $\\{v_3, b_1, b_2\\}$. Removing $v_3$ disconnects $v_4$, the triangle vertices $\\{b_1, b_2\\}$, and the path from $v_2$. So, $v_3$ is also a cut vertex.\n\nThe set of cut vertices of $G$ is $\\{v_2, v_3\\}$. There are exactly two cut vertices. This already confirms that statement D is correct. We will continue the analysis to verify that the other statements are incorrect.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the Blocks of G**\nBlocks are maximal 2-connected subgraphs or bridges. We can find them by identifying edge sets that lie on common simple cycles, or edges that are bridges.\n- **Block 1 ($B_1$)**: The edges $\\{(v_2, a_1), (a_1, a_2), (a_2, v_2)\\}$ form a cycle (a triangle). This is a 2-connected subgraph. It is maximal because adding any other adjacent vertex (like $v_1$ or $v_3$) and its edge to $v_2$ would make $v_2$ a cut vertex of the new subgraph. So, the subgraph induced by vertices $\\{v_2, a_1, a_2\\}$ is a block.\n- **Block 2 ($B_2$)**: Similarly, the edges $\\{(v_3, b_1), (b_1, b_2), (b_2, v_3)\\}$ form a triangle. The subgraph induced by vertices $\\{v_3, b_1, b_2\\}$ is another block.\n- **Block 3 ($B_3$)**: The edge $(v_1, v_2)$ is not part of any cycle. It is a bridge. Therefore, it forms a block by itself. The subgraph with vertices $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$ and edge $(v_1, v_2)$ is a block.\n- **Block 4 ($B_4$)**: The edge $(v_2, v_3)$ connects the two cut vertices. It is not part of any simple cycle in $G$. Therefore, it is a bridge between the larger components around $v_2$ and $v_3$ and forms a block by itself. The subgraph with vertices $\\{v_2, v_3\\}$ and edge $(v_2, v_3)$ is a block.\n- **Block 5 ($B_5$)**: The edge $(v_3, v_4)$ is not part of any cycle. It is a bridge. It forms a block by itself. The subgraph with vertices $\\{v_3, v_4\\}$ and edge $(v_3, v_4)$ is a block.\n\nSo, there are 5 blocks in $G$.\n\n**Step 3: Construct the Block-Cut Tree T(G)**\nThe vertices of $T(G)$ are the cut vertices and the blocks of $G$.\n- Cut vertex nodes: $v_2, v_3$.\n- Block nodes: $B_1, B_2, B_3, B_4, B_5$.\nThe total number of nodes in $T(G)$ is $2 + 5 = 7$.\n- This immediately shows that statement E, \"The tree $T(G)$ has a total of 8 nodes,\" is incorrect.\n\nThe edges of $T(G)$ connect a block node to a cut-vertex node if the vertex is in the block.\n- Cut vertex $v_2$ is in blocks $B_1$ (triangle), $B_3$ (edge to $v_1$), and $B_4$ (edge to $v_3$). So, $T(G)$ has edges $(v_2, B_1)$, $(v_2, B_3)$, and $(v_2, B_4)$.\n- Cut vertex $v_3$ is in blocks $B_2$ (triangle), $B_4$ (edge to $v_2$), and $B_5$ (edge to $v_4$). So, $T(G)$ has edges $(v_3, B_2)$, $(v_3, B_4)$, and $(v_3, B_5)$.\n\nThe structure of T(G) is:\n$B_1 - v_2 - B_4 - v_3 - B_2$\nwith $B_3$ also connected to $v_2$, and $B_5$ also connected to $v_3$.\nThe tree can be drawn as:\n$B_3 - v_2 - B_4 - v_3 - B_5$\n      $|$          $|$\n     $B_1$        $B_2$\n\n**Step 4: Analyze Properties of T(G) and Evaluate the Options**\n\n- **A. Leaves of T(G):** The leaves are the nodes with degree 1.\n    - $\\deg(B_1) = 1$ (connected to $v_2$)\n    - $\\deg(B_2) = 1$ (connected to $v_3$)\n    - $\\deg(B_3) = 1$ (connected to $v_2$)\n    - $\\deg(B_5) = 1$ (connected to $v_3$)\n    - All other nodes have degree greater than 1: $\\deg(v_2) = 3$, $\\deg(v_3) = 3$, $\\deg(B_4) = 2$.\n    There are 4 leaves ($B_1, B_2, B_3, B_5$). Thus, statement A is incorrect.\n\n- **B. Diameter of T(G):** The diameter is the longest path between any two nodes, which will be between two leaves.\n    - Path from $B_3$ to $B_5$: $B_3 - v_2 - B_4 - v_3 - B_5$. The length is 4 edges.\n    - Path from $B_3$ to $B_2$: $B_3 - v_2 - B_4 - v_3 - B_2$. The length is 4 edges.\n    - Path from $B_1$ to $B_5$: $B_1 - v_2 - B_4 - v_3 - B_5$. The length is 4 edges.\n    - Path from $B_1$ to $B_2$: $B_1 - v_2 - B_4 - v_3 - B_2$. The length is 4 edges.\n    The diameter of $T(G)$ is 4. Thus, statement B is incorrect.\n\n- **C. Nodes with degree 3:**\n    - $\\deg(v_2) = 3$ (connected to $B_1, B_3, B_4$).\n    - $\\deg(v_3) = 3$ (connected to $B_2, B_4, B_5$).\n    There are two nodes with degree 3. Thus, statement C is incorrect.\n\n- **D. Number of cut vertex nodes:** As established in Step 1, the cut vertices are $\\{v_2, v_3\\}$. There are exactly two. Thus, statement D is correct.\n\n- **E. Total number of nodes:** As established in Step 3, there are 5 block nodes and 2 cut-vertex nodes, for a total of 7 nodes. Thus, statement E is incorrect.\n\nThe only correct statement is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1515749"}]}
