This practice explores that very question by introducing vertex connectivity, a key measure of a network's robustness against node failures. By analyzing two simple but distinct network topologies, you will see firsthand how the arrangement of connections, not just their quantity, determines how vulnerable a network is to disruption. [@problem_id:1492120]", "problem": "Consider two distinct network architectures, designated as Network A and Network B. Both networks are modeled as simple, connected, undirected graphs with 5 vertices (representing servers) and 5 edges (representing communication links).\n\nThe topology of Network A is a 5-cycle ($C_5$), where the 5 servers are arranged in a single closed loop.\n\nThe topology of Network B is constructed from a 4-cycle ($C_4$). Four of the servers form this cycle, and the fifth server is connected by a single link to exactly one of the servers in the 4-cycle.\n\nThe resilience of a network to server failures is measured by its vertex connectivity, denoted $\\kappa$. The vertex connectivity of a graph is the minimum number of vertices that must be removed to either disconnect the graph into two or more components, or reduce it to a single vertex.\n\nDetermine the vertex connectivity of Network A and the vertex connectivity of Network B. Report these two integer values, sorted in ascending order.", "solution": "We use the definition of vertex connectivity: for a graph $G$, $\\kappa(G)$ is the minimum number of vertices whose removal disconnects $G$ into at least two components or reduces it to a single vertex. We also use the general bound $\\kappa(G) \\leq \\delta(G)$, where $\\delta(G)$ is the minimum degree of $G$.\n\nNetwork A (the cycle $C_{5}$): Each vertex in $C_{5}$ has degree $2$, so $\\delta(C_{5})=2$ and therefore $\\kappa(C_{5}) \\leq 2$. Removing any single vertex from $C_{5}$ leaves a path on $4$ vertices, which is connected, so no $1$-vertex removal disconnects the graph; hence $\\kappa(C_{5}) \\geq 2$. To see that two vertices suffice, remove two nonadjacent vertices (for example, remove $v_{1}$ and $v_{3}$ when the cycle is $v_{1}-v_{2}-v_{3}-v_{4}-v_{5}-v_{1}$). The remaining graph has an isolated vertex $v_{2}$ and an edge $v_{4}v_{5}$, so it is disconnected. Therefore $\\kappa(C_{5})=2$.\n\nNetwork B (a $C_{4}$ with a leaf attached to one cycle vertex): Let the cycle be $a-b-c-d-a$ and let $x$ be the leaf attached only to $a$. Then $\\delta(G)=1$ (the leaf), so $\\kappa(G) \\leq 1$. The graph is connected and nontrivial, so removing zero vertices does not disconnect it, implying $\\kappa(G) \\geq 1$. Moreover, removing the single vertex $a$ separates $x$ from the path $b-c-d$, yielding a disconnected graph, so $\\kappa(G)=1$.\n\nThus the two vertex connectivities are $1$ (Network B) and $2$ (Network A).

This exercise moves from analyzing arbitrary graphs to understanding the inherent connectivity of a specific, important graph family: the complete bipartite graph. By modeling a network of computing clusters and storage units, you will learn to determine the vertex connectivity by reasoning about the graph's fundamental structure, a skill essential for designing and analyzing structured networks.

The network consists of two distinct types of nodes: a set of 4 high-performance computing clusters and a set of 7 data storage units. The network architecture is designed for maximum redundancy in a specific way: every computing cluster is directly connected to every data storage unit. However, there are no direct connections between any two computing clusters, and no direct connections between any two data storage units.\n\nA 'node failure' occurs when a node (either a cluster or a storage unit) and all its associated connections are removed from the network. The network is considered 'compromised' if the remaining active nodes can no longer all communicate with each other, meaning the graph of remaining nodes and connections becomes disconnected.\n\nDetermine the minimum number of simultaneous node failures that are guaranteed to compromise the network.", "solution": "Model the network as the complete bipartite graph $K_{4,7}$ with bipartition $L$ (the $4$ computing clusters) and $R$ (the $7$ storage units), so $|L|=4$, $|R|=7$, and edge set $E=L\\times R$. A node failure corresponds to removing a vertex and all incident edges. The network is compromised exactly when the remaining graph becomes disconnected.\n\nKey observation: For a complete bipartite graph, if after removals both sides retain at least one vertex, then the remaining graph is connected. Indeed, if $u,v$ lie in opposite parts they are adjacent; if $u,v$ lie in the same part, pick any vertex $w$ in the opposite nonempty part to obtain a path $u\\text{--}w\\text{--}v$. Thus a necessary condition for disconnection is that one entire part becomes empty.\n\nLet $S$ be the set of failed nodes with $|S|=k$. If $k\\leq 3$, then it is impossible to remove all $4$ vertices of $L$, so $L\\setminus S\\neq\\emptyset$. Also, since $k\\leq 37$, we cannot remove all $7$ vertices of $R$, so $R\\setminus S\\neq\\emptyset$. Hence both parts are nonempty, and by the observation above, the remaining graph is connected. Therefore no set of $k\\leq 3$ failures can compromise the network.\n\nIf $k=4$, choose $S=L$ (all $4$ clusters). Then the remaining vertex set is $R$ with no edges among its $7$ vertices, yielding a disconnected graph (in fact, $7$ isolated vertices). Hence there exists a set of $4$ failures that compromises the network.\n\nCombining these, the minimum number of simultaneous node failures whose removal disconnects the network is $4$.

This practice challenges that intuition by exploring the relationship between a local property, minimum degree $\\delta(G)$, and a global property, vertex connectivity $\\kappa(G)$. You will identify a graph that, despite having a relatively high minimum degree, has a critical single point of failure, demonstrating the crucial distinction between local density and global resilience.

The *degree* of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it, and the *minimum degree* of a graph $G$, denoted $\\delta(G)$, is the smallest degree among all its vertices. The *vertex connectivity* of a graph $G$, denoted $\\kappa(G)$, is the minimum number of vertices whose removal would either disconnect the graph or reduce it to a single vertex.

By definition, $\\kappa(G)=1$ holds if and only if $G$ has a cut-vertex, i.e., a single vertex whose removal disconnects the graph.\n\nConsider each option:\n\nOption A: $K_{4}$. In $K_{n}$, every vertex has degree $n-1$, so $\\delta(K_{4})=3$. The vertex connectivity of a complete graph is $\\kappa(K_{n})=n-1$, hence $\\kappa(K_{4})=3$. Therefore $K_{4}$ does not satisfy $\\kappa(G)=1$.\n\nOption B: Two copies of $K_{4}$ identified at one vertex. Let the shared vertex be $v$. In each original $K_{4}$, a non-identified vertex has degree $3$; identification does not add neighbors to such a vertex outside its original $K_{4}$, so every non-shared vertex still has degree $3$. The shared vertex $v$ is adjacent to the $3$ remaining vertices from each copy, so $\\deg(v)=6$. Hence $\\delta(G)=3$. Removing $v$ separates the graph into two disjoint copies of $K_{3}$, so $v$ is a cut-vertex. Therefore $\\kappa(G)=1$. This option satisfies both required properties.\n\nOption C: The cubical graph (the $3$-cube). Each vertex has degree $3$, so $\\delta(G)=3$. However, the $3$-cube has no cut-vertex; equivalently, it is $3$-vertex-connected, so $\\kappa(G)=3$. Therefore it does not satisfy $\\kappa(G)=1$.\n\nOption D: $W_{7}$. In a wheel $W_{n}$ with $n \\ge 4$, the hub has degree $n-1$, and each rim vertex has degree $3$, so $\\delta(W_{7})=3$. Removing the hub leaves the cycle $C_{6}$, which is connected, and removing any rim vertex leaves the hub still adjacent to all remaining rim vertices, so there is no cut-vertex. Thus $\\kappa(W_{7}) \\ge 2$, and in fact $\\kappa(W_{7})=3$.
