The single edge $(v_{3},v_{4})$ connects these two triangles. All edges within the triangles lie on cycles and hence are not bridges. The edge $(v_{3},v_{4})$ does not belong to any cycle, since there is no alternative path between $v_{3}$ and $v_{4}$ avoiding it; removing it disconnects the graph into two components. Therefore this graph is connected and has exactly one bridge, namely $(v_{3},v_{4})$.\n\nFor option B, the edges form a $6$-cycle $(v_{1},v_{2},v_{3},v_{4},v_{5},v_{6},v_{1})$ plus the chord $(v_{1},v_{4})$. Every edge lies on some cycle (the $6$-cycle or a shorter cycle using the chord), so there are no bridges.\n\nFor option C, the subgraph on $\\{v_{1},v_{2},v_{3},v_{4}\\}$ is a $4$-cycle with a chord $(v_{2},v_{4})$, and $\\{(v_{1},v_{5}),(v_{5},v_{6})\\}$ is a path attached at $v_{1}$.

Each edge of the $5$-cycle lies on that cycle, $(v_{1},v_{6})$ lies on the cycle $v_{1}-v_{6}-v_{3}-v_{2}-v_{1}$, and $(v_{3},v_{6})$ lies on the cycle $v_{3}-v_{6}-v_{1}-v_{2}-v_{3}$.

A critical concern is network resilience. A link is defined as a **bridge** if its failure (i.e., removal of the corresponding edge) increases the number of connected components in the network.\n\nThe architect is interested in a specific, non-obvious vulnerability: a network configuration that contains a bridge $e = (u, v)$ where both routers $u$ and $v$ are non-trivial hubs, meaning each is connected to at least one other router besides their connection to each other. In graph theory terms, the architect is looking for a graph containing a bridge $e = (u, v)$ such that the degree of vertex $u$ is $\\deg(u) > 1$ and the degree of vertex $v$ is $\\deg(v) > 1$.\n\nWhich of the following network configurations, if any, exhibits this specific property?\n\nA.

An edge $e=(u,v)$ is a bridge if and only if removing it increases the number of connected components. Equivalently, an edge is a bridge if and only if it does not lie on any cycle. The target property requires a bridge $e=(u,v)$ with $\\deg(u)>1$ and $\\deg(v)>1$.\n\nCase A: A cycle on five vertices (the $5$-cycle). In a cycle, every edge lies on a cycle. Therefore, for any edge $e$, there exists an alternate path between its endpoints that avoids $e$, so removing $e$ leaves the graph connected. Hence no edge is a bridge, so the required property does not occur.\n\nCase B: A star with center $c$ and leaves $p_{1},p_{2},p_{3},p_{4}$. For any edge $e=(c,p_{i})$, removing $e$ disconnects $p_{i}$ from the rest, so $e$ is a bridge. However, $\\deg(c)=4>1$ while $\\deg(p_{i})=1$. The condition requires both endpoints to have degree greater than $1$, which fails here. Thus the required property does not occur.\n\nCase C: Two triangles $\\{v_{1},v_{2},v_{3}\\}$ and $\\{v_{4},v_{5},v_{6}\\}$ with all internal edges present in each triangle, connected by a single edge $e=(v_{1},v_{4})$. The edge $e$ is the only connection between the two $3$-cliques, so it does not lie on any cycle spanning both clusters. Removing $e$ separates the graph into two connected components, so $e$ is a bridge. Moreover, $\\deg(v_{1})=3$ (neighbors $v_{2},v_{3},v_{4}$) and $\\deg(v_{4})=3$ (neighbors $v_{5},v_{6},v_{1}$), hence both degrees exceed $1$. Therefore this configuration satisfies the required property.\n\nCase D: The complete graph on five vertices $K_{5}$. In $K_{5}$, the edge connectivity is $4$, and in particular, removing any single edge leaves the graph connected. Equivalently, every edge lies on many cycles. Thus there are no bridges, and the required property does not occur.\n\nOnly configuration C exhibits a bridge whose endpoints both have degree greater than $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1493374"}, {"introduction": "Having explored specific instances of bridges, we now turn to a question of limits and structure. What is the maximum number of bridges a connected graph on $n$ vertices can possibly have? This problem [@problem_id:1493381] guides you to the answer by linking the concept of bridges to the fundamental structure of trees, revealing that a graph saturated with the maximum number of bridges is, in fact, a tree.", "problem": "Consider a simple connected graph $G$ with a set of vertices $V$ and a set of edges $E$. The number of vertices is $|V|=n$, where $n \\geq 2$. An edge in $G$ is called a *bridge* if its removal increases the number of connected components of the graph.\n\nWe define a graph transformation process. Let $E_{nb}$ be the set of all edges in $E$ that are *not* bridges. A new multigraph, denoted $G'$, is constructed from $G$ by applying an edge contraction operation for every edge in $E_{nb}$. The contraction of an edge $(u,v)$ consists of merging the vertices $u$ and $v$ into a single new vertex, while any other edge incident to either $u$ or $v$ becomes incident to the new merged vertex. This process is repeated until all edges in $E_{nb}$ have been contracted. If this procedure creates multiple edges between the same pair of vertices in $G'$, these multiple edges are kept. However, any self-loops (edges connecting a vertex to itself) that are formed must be removed.\n\nDetermine the maximum possible number of edges that the resulting multigraph $G'$ can have. Express your answer as a function of $n$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the maximum number of edges in a multigraph $G'$ which is derived from a simple connected graph $G$ with $n$ vertices by contracting all non-bridge edges.\n\nFirst, let's understand the structure of the original graph $G$ in relation to its bridges. An edge is a non-bridge if and only if it is part of a cycle. The set of all edges that lie on cycles can be partitioned based on maximal 2-edge-connected subgraphs. A 2-edge-connected subgraph is a connected subgraph where at least two edges must be removed to disconnect it. Within such a subgraph, every edge lies on a cycle and is therefore a non-bridge.\n\nThe transformation process contracts all non-bridge edges. This means that all edges within each maximal 2-edge-connected subgraph of $G$ will be contracted. The effect of contracting all edges in a connected subgraph is to collapse that entire subgraph into a single vertex.\n\nSo, the vertices of the transformed graph $G'$ correspond to the maximal 2-edge-connected subgraphs of the original graph $G$. Let's call these subgraphs \"blocks\" for this analysis.\n\nThe edges that are not contracted are the bridges of $G$. By definition, a bridge connects two different maximal 2-edge-connected subgraphs (where a single vertex can be considered a trivial 2-edge-connected subgraph). When the blocks are collapsed into single vertices in $G'$, the bridges that connected them in $G$ become edges connecting the corresponding new vertices in $G'$.\n\nTherefore, the set of edges in $G'$ is precisely the set of bridges of $G$. The number of edges in $G'$ is equal to the number of bridges in $G$.\n\nThe problem has now been reduced to finding the maximum possible number of bridges in any simple connected graph $G$ with $n$ vertices.\n\nLet $b$ be the number of bridges in $G$. If we remove all $b$ bridges from $G$, the graph will split into a number of connected components. The removal of each bridge increases the number of connected components by exactly one. Starting with one component (the connected graph $G$), removing $b$ bridges results in $k = b+1$ connected components.\n\nLet these $k$ components be $C_1, C_2, \\dots, C_k$. Each original vertex of $G$ must belong to exactly one of these components. Let $n_i$ be the number of vertices in component $C_i$. We have $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} n_i = n$. Since each component must contain at least one vertex, $n_i \\geq 1$ for all $i=1, \\dots, k$.\n\nFrom $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} n_i = n$ and $n_i \\geq 1$, it follows that the number of components $k$ cannot exceed the total number of vertices $n$.\nSo, $k \\leq n$.\nSubstituting $k = b+1$, we get:\n$b+1 \\leq n$\n$b \\leq n-1$\n\nThis shows that the number of bridges in any simple connected graph with $n$ vertices cannot be more than $n-1$.\n\nTo find the maximum possible number of bridges, we must check if this upper bound of $n-1$ is achievable. We need to construct a simple connected graph with $n$ vertices that has exactly $n-1$ bridges.\n\nConsider a tree graph on $n$ vertices. A tree is a connected graph with no cycles. By definition, an edge is a bridge if and only if it is not part of any cycle. In a tree, no edge is part of a cycle, so every edge is a bridge. A tree with $n$ vertices always has exactly $n-1$ edges. Therefore, a tree on $n$ vertices is a simple connected graph with $n-1$ bridges. Examples include the path graph $P_n$ and the star graph $K_{1, n-1}$.\n\nSince the maximum number of bridges is $n-1$, and the number of edges in $G'$ is equal to the number of bridges in $G$, the maximum possible number of edges in $G'$ is $n-1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{n-1}$$", "id": "1493381"}]}
