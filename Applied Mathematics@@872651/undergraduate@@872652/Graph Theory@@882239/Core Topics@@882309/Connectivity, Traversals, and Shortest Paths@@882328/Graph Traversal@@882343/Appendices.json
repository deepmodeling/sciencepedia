The timer displays time in a 24-hour format, ranging from 00:00 to 23:59. The interface has only two buttons:\n\n1.  A \"+1 Minute\" button: This button advances the time by exactly one minute. When the time is `H:M` where `M` is less than 59, pressing it changes the time to `H:(M+1)`. If the time is `H:59`, it changes to `(H+1):00`, wrapping around from `23:59` to `00:00`.\n2.  A \"+1 Hour\" button: This button advances the time by exactly one hour. When the time is `H:M`, pressing it changes the time to `(H+1):M`, wrapping around from hour 23 to hour 0.

Solving this problem will enhance your ability to deduce network characteristics from traversal behavior, showing that a simple traversal can reveal whether a graph can be two-colored [@problem_id:1508937].", "problem": "In the design of a fault-tolerant communication network, engineers are exploring a redundancy protocol. For a data packet to be validated, it must be possible for it to travel from a source node to a destination node by traversing a path with an even number of links. A path is defined as a sequence of distinct vertices connected by edges.\n\nThe network topology is represented by an undirected graph with a set of 8 nodes, labeled A through H. The connections (edges) are given by the following adjacency list:\n- A: [B, D]\n- B: [A, C, G]\n- C: [B, D, F]\n- D: [A, C, E]\n- E: [D, F, H]\n- F: [C, E, G]\n- G: [B, F, H]\n- H: [E, G]\n\nBased on this network structure, which one of the following statements is true?\n\nA.

A path with an even number of links does not exist for either pair (A, G) or (B, E).", "solution": "We need to determine, for the given undirected graph, whether there exist simple paths (paths with all vertices distinct) of even length between the specified pairs of vertices. The key graph-theoretic principle we use is the characterization of bipartite graphs: a graph is bipartite if and only if it contains no odd cycle, and equivalently, its vertices can be partitioned into two disjoint sets so that every edge joins one set to the other. In a bipartite graph with partition sets $X$ and $Y$, any path alternates between $X$ and $Y$, so for any path from $u$ to $v$, the length $\\ell$ satisfies\n$$\n\\ell \\equiv \n\\begin{cases}\n0 \\pmod{2},  \\text{if } u,v \\in X \\text{ or } u,v \\in Y, \\\\\n1 \\pmod{2},  \\text{if } u \\in X, v \\in Y \\text{ or } u \\in Y, v \\in X.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nTherefore, an even-length path between two vertices exists if and only if they lie in the same part of a bipartition, provided the graph is connected between them.\n\nWe now show the given graph is bipartite by constructing a valid $2$-coloring (partition). Start by placing $A$ in $X$. Since $A$ is adjacent to $B$ and $D$, we must place $B,D \\in Y$. Since $B$ is adjacent to $C$ and $G$, we must place $C,G \\in X$. Since $D$ is adjacent to $C$ and $E$, this requires $C \\in X$ (consistent) and $E \\in X$. Next, since $C$ is adjacent to $F$, we place $F \\in Y$. Since $E$ is adjacent to $H$, we place $H \\in Y$. Check all remaining adjacencies: $F$ is adjacent to $C,E,G$ which lie in $X$, and $G$ is adjacent to $B,F,H$ which lie in $Y$, and $H$ is adjacent to $E,G$ which lie in $X$. This assignment is consistent, so the graph is bipartite with\n$$\nX = \\{A,C,E,G\\}, \\quad Y = \\{B,D,F,H\\}.\n$$\n\nApply the parity rule:\n- For $(A,G)$, we have $A \\in X$ and $G \\in X$, so any $A$–$G$ path has even length, hence an even-length path exists. An explicit example is $A-B-G$, which has length $2$ and uses distinct vertices.\n- For $(B,E)$, we have $B \\in Y$ and $E \\in X$, so any $B$–$E$ path has odd length. Therefore, there is no even-length path from $B$ to $E$. For instance, no path of length $2$ exists because from $B$ to any neighbor in $\\{A,C,G\\}$, none is adjacent to $E$, and the bipartition argument rules out all even lengths in general.\n\nThus, an even-length path exists from $A$ to $G$ but not from $B$ to $E$, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1508937"}, {"introduction": "Real-world applications of graph traversal often involve complex constraints beyond simply finding the shortest route from a source $s$ to a target $t$.

The PacketBot must start at its home depot, collect a set of essential packages from various fulfillment centers across the city, and deliver them to a final destination hub.\n\nThe transport network is represented as an undirected graph where hubs are vertices and sky-lanes are edges with associated travel times. There are $K=3$ distinct types of essential packages. Each fulfillment center hub specializes in only one type of package.

The shortest path from 0 to 5 that avoids type-2 hubs (2 and 6) is $0 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 5$, with a cost of $4+6+9=19$. From hub 5, the drone must then detour to a type-2 hub and then to hub 7.
