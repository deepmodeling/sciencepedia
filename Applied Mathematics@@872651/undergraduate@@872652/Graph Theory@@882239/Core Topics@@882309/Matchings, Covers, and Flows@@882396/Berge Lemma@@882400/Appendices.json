The given matching is $M=\\{\\{v_{2},v_{3}\\},\\{v_{4},v_{5}\\},\\{v_{6},v_{7}\\}\\}$.\n\nTo determine $L_{S}$, the length of a shortest path between $v_{1}$ and $v_{8}$, observe that there is no edge $\\{v_{1},v_{8}\\}$, so a path of length $1$ does not exist. The path $v_{1}-v_{9}-v_{8}$ has length $2$, hence $L_{S}\\leq 2$. Any path along the chain $v_{1}-v_{2}-v_{3}-v_{4}-v_{5}-v_{6}-v_{7}-v_{8}$ has length $7$, which is longer. Therefore the shortest possible length is achieved by $v_{1}-v_{9}-v_{8}$, and we conclude $L_{S}=2$.\n\nTo determine $L_{A}$, the length of a shortest $M$-alternating path between $v_{1}$ and $v_{8}$, recall that an $M$-alternating path must have its edges alternating between those not in $M$ and those in $M$. The edges incident to $v_{9}$, namely $\\{v_{1},v_{9}\\}$ and $\\{v_{9},v_{8}\\}$, are not in $M$. If a path uses $v_{9}$ internally, it would necessarily traverse two consecutive edges not in $M$, violating alternation. Moreover, starting at $v_{1}$, any first edge is not in $M$ (either $\\{v_{1},v_{2}\\}$ or $\\{v_{1},v_{9}\\}$), and from $v_{9}$ there is no edge in $M$, so no $M$-alternating path can include $v_{9}$. Hence any $M$-alternating path from $v_{1}$ to $v_{8}$ must lie entirely on the chain $v_{1},v_{2},\\dots,v_{8}$.\n\nAlong this chain, the membership of edges in $M$ alternates as follows:\n$\\{v_{1},v_{2}\\}\\notin M$, $\\{v_{2},v_{3}\\}\\in M$, $\\{v_{3},v_{4}\\}\\notin M$, $\\{v_{4},v_{5}\\}\\in M$, $\\{v_{5},v_{6}\\}\\notin M$, $\\{v_{6},v_{7}\\}\\in M$, $\\{v_{7},v_{8}\\}\\notin M$.\nTherefore, the unique simple path $v_{1}-v_{2}-v_{3}-v_{4}-v_{5}-v_{6}-v_{7}-v_{8}$ is $M$-alternating and has length $7$. Since no path using $v_{9}$ can be alternating and there is no shorter simple path between $v_{1}$ and $v_{8}$ on the chain, this is the shortest $M$-alternating path.
