The network topology is structured such that every hub is connected by a direct fiber-optic link to exactly 3 other distinct hubs.\n\nFor maintenance planning, the network administrators need to determine the maximum number of hubs that can be shut down simultaneously for upgrades, under the strict constraint that no two hubs chosen for shutdown are directly connected by a fiber-optic link. Through analysis, they have determined this maximum number to be 5.\n\nFor network security monitoring, the company must install a special intrusion detection system (IDS) on a selection of hubs. The installation must guarantee that every single fiber-optic link in the network is incident to at least one hub running the IDS. To minimize costs, they wish to find the absolute minimum number of hubs that must be equipped with the IDS to satisfy this monitoring requirement.\n\nWhat is this minimum number of hubs required for the IDS installation?", "solution": "Let the network be modeled by a graph $G=(V,E)$ with $|V|=12$, where vertices are hubs and edges are fiber-optic links. The requirement that no two simultaneously shut-down hubs are directly connected describes an independent set. The given maximum number of such hubs is the independence number, so $\\alpha(G)=5$.\n\nAn IDS placement that ensures every link is incident to at least one instrumented hub is a vertex cover $C \\subseteq V$, i.e., every edge in $E$ has at least one endpoint in $C$. The minimum number of hubs needed is the minimum vertex cover size $\\tau(G)$.\n\nWe use Gallai's first identity, which states that for any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, the sum of the independence number and the vertex cover number equals $n$:\n$$\n\\alpha(G) + \\tau(G) = n\n$$\nThe identity arises from the fact that a set of vertices is an independent set if and only if its complement is a vertex cover.\nLet $I_{max}$ be a maximum independent set of size $\\alpha(G)$. Its complement, $V \\setminus I_{max}$, is a vertex cover of size $n - \\alpha(G)$. This implies $\\tau(G) \\le n - \\alpha(G)$.\nConversely, let $C_{min}$ be a minimum vertex cover of size $\\tau(G)$. Its complement, $V \\setminus C_{min}$, is an independent set of size $n - \\tau(G)$. This implies $\\alpha(G) \\ge n - \\tau(G)$.\nCombining the two inequalities forces the equality $\\alpha(G) + \\tau(G) = n$.\n\nSubstituting $|V|=12$ and $\\alpha(G)=5$, we can solve for $\\tau(G)$:\n$$\n\\tau(G) = |V| - \\alpha(G) = 12 - 5 = 7.\n$$\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of hubs that must be equipped with the IDS is $7$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{7}$$", "id": "1506375"}, {"introduction": "Building on the concept of duality, this practice focuses on the second of Gallai's identities, which connects maximum matchings and minimum edge covers. The exercise demonstrates that for graphs without isolated vertices, knowing the size of one allows us to immediately determine the size of the other through the relation $\\alpha'(G) + \\beta'(G) = n$. This problem highlights another powerful symmetry in graph structures and its utility in resource allocation scenarios.", "problem": "A company manages a private communication network composed of 15 nodes interconnected by physical links. For security reasons, when communication channels are active, no single node can be part of more than one active link at a time. A set of links that can be simultaneously active under this rule is called a valid communication set. After a thorough analysis of the network's structure, it has been determined that the maximum number of links in any valid communication set is 6.\n\nSeparately, for maintenance purposes, the company needs to select a subset of links to form a 'monitoring cover'. A monitoring cover is a set of links chosen such that every node in the network is an endpoint of at least one link within the cover. The network has been designed such that there are no isolated nodes.\n\nWhat is the minimum possible number of links required to form a monitoring cover?", "solution": "Model the network as a simple graph $G$ with $n=15$ vertices (nodes) and edges (links). A \"valid communication set\" is a set of links where no two links share a node, which corresponds to a matching in the graph. The problem states that the maximum size of such a set is 6, so the matching number is $\\alpha'(G) = 6$. A \"monitoring cover\" is a set of links such that every node is an endpoint of at least one link, which corresponds to an edge cover. We need to find the minimum size of an edge cover, which is the edge cover number $\\beta'(G)$.\n\nWe use Gallai's second identity, which states that for any graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and no isolated vertices:\n$$\n\\alpha'(G) + \\beta'(G) = n\n$$\n\nA brief justification for this identity is as follows:\n1.  **Proof of $\\beta'(G) \\le n - \\alpha'(G)$**: Let $M$ be a maximum matching of size $\\alpha'(G)$. It covers $2\\alpha'(G)$ vertices. To cover the remaining $n - 2\\alpha'(G)$ unsaturated vertices, we can select one incident edge for each. The set formed by $M$ and these additional edges is an edge cover. Its size is at most $|M| + (n - 2|M|) = n - \\alpha'(G)$. The minimum edge cover $\\beta'(G)$ can therefore be no larger than this.\n\n2.  **Proof of $\\beta'(G) \\ge n - \\alpha'(G)$**: Let $L$ be a minimum edge cover of size $\\beta'(G)$. The subgraph formed by these edges must be a forest with $c$ components, so $\\beta'(G) = n-c$. Since there are no isolated vertices, each component is a tree with at least one edge. We can select one edge from each of the $c$ disjoint components to form a matching of size $c$. Therefore, the maximum matching size $\\alpha'(G)$ must be at least $c$. This gives $\\alpha'(G) \\ge c = n - \\beta'(G)$.\n\nCombining both inequalities yields the identity.\n\nApplying this to the network with $n=15$ and $\\alpha'(G)=6$:\n$$\n\\beta'(G) = n - \\alpha'(G) = 15 - 6 = 9.\n$$\n\nTherefore, the minimum possible number of links required for a monitoring cover is $9$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9}$$", "id": "1506391"}, {"introduction": "This final exercise brings everything together by asking you to compute all four key graph parameters for a specific tree.

The **vertex cover number**, denoted $\\tau(G)$, is the size of a minimum vertex cover (a set of vertices such that every edge has at least one endpoint in the set).\n3.

The leaves of the tree are $\\{v_1, v_4, v_5, v_6, v_7\\}$. This set is independent and has size 5. The remaining vertices $\\{v_2, v_3\\}$ are adjacent, so we cannot create a larger independent set. Thus, $\\alpha(T) = 5$.\n\n2.  **Vertex Cover Number $\\tau(T)$**: We can use Gallai's first identity: $\\alpha(T) + \\tau(T) = n$.\n    $$ \\tau(T) = n - \\alpha(T) = 7 - 5 = 2. $$\n    We can verify this directly. The set $\\{v_2, v_3\\}$ is a vertex cover of size 2, as every edge is incident to either $v_2$ or $v_3$. Since the graph is not an empty graph, $\\tau(T)$ cannot be 0 or 1, so this is minimal.\n\n3.  **Matching Number $\\alpha'(T)$**: We want the largest set of edges with no common vertices. We can select the edge $(v_1, v_2)$ and the edge $(v_3, v_4)$. This is a matching of size 2. We cannot select 3 edges, as any 3 edges would have to share a vertex (the graph only has two non-leaf vertices, $v_2$ and $v_3$, which are adjacent). For example, any matching cannot contain the edge $(v_2, v_3)$ and other edges. If a matching does not contain $(v_2, v_3)$, it can have at most one edge incident to $v_2$ and at most one edge incident to $v_3$. Thus, the maximum size is 2. So, $\\alpha'(T) = 2$.\n\n4.  **Edge Cover Number $\\beta'(T)$**: Since the tree has no isolated vertices, we can use Gallai's second identity: $\\alpha'(T) + \\beta'(T) = n$.\n    $$ \\beta'(T) = n - \\alpha'(T) = 7 - 2 = 5. $$\n    An example of a minimum edge cover is the set of edges incident to the leaves: $\\{(v_1, v_2), (v_4, v_3), (v_5, v_2), (v_6, v_3), (v_7, v_3)\\}$.
