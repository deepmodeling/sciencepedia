This network consists of $n=50$ servers, and it is configured as a *complete graph*, meaning every server has a direct, dedicated communication link to every other server.\n\nTo monitor the health of all communication links, monitoring software must be installed on a subset of these servers. A monitoring set is a group of servers chosen such that for every communication link in the network, at least one of the two servers connected by that link is in the monitoring set. Due to budget and resource constraints, the goal is to find a monitoring set with the smallest possible number of servers.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of servers that must be included in the monitoring set to ensure all communication links are monitored?", "solution": "We model the servers and communication links as the complete graph $K_{n}$ with $n=50$ vertices.

The server nodes represent the vertices $V = \\{v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n\\}$ and the communication links represent the edges $E = \\{(v_i, v_{i+1}) \\mid 1 \\le i < n\\}$. This graph is a path graph on $n$ vertices, denoted as $P_n$.\n\nA security scanner at a node $v_i$ covers all incident edges. A \"fully monitored network\" corresponds to a set of vertices $C \\subseteq V$ such that every edge in $E$ has at least one of its endpoints in $C$. In graph theory, this set $C$ is known as a vertex cover. The problem asks for the size of a minimum vertex cover for the path graph $P_n$. Let this quantity be denoted by $\\tau(P_n)$.\n\nFirst, we establish a lower bound for $\\tau(P_n)$. The path graph $P_n$ has $|E| = n-1$ edges. In $P_n$, the two endpoint vertices ($v_1$ and $v_n$) have a degree of 1, and all intermediate vertices ($v_2, \\dots, v_{n-1}$) have a degree of 2. Therefore, any single vertex can cover at most 2 edges. If we have a vertex cover of size $k$, the total number of edges covered is at most $2k$. To cover all $n-1$ edges, we must satisfy the inequality:\n$$2k \\ge n-1$$\nThis implies that $k \\ge \\frac{n-1}{2}$. Since $k$ must be an integer, we have:\n$$\\tau(P_n) \\ge \\left\\lceil \\frac{n-1}{2} \\right\\rceil$$\n\nNext, we establish an upper bound for $\\tau(P_n)$ by constructing a valid vertex cover. Consider the set of vertices with even-numbered indices:\n$$C = \\{v_{2i} \\mid i \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+, 2i \\le n\\}$$\nLet's verify if this set $C$ is a vertex cover. An arbitrary edge in $P_n$ is of the form $(v_j, v_{j+1})$ for $1 \\le j < n$. For any such integer $j$, one of the two consecutive integers $j$ or $j+1$ must be even.\n- If $j$ is even, then the vertex $v_j$ is in our set $C$. Thus, the edge $(v_j, v_{j+1})$ is covered.\n- If $j$ is odd, then $j+1$ is even. In this case, the vertex $v_{j+1}$ is in our set $C$. Thus, the edge $(v_j, v_{j+1})$ is covered.\nSince every edge in $P_n$ has at least one endpoint with an even index, the set $C$ is a valid vertex cover.\n\nNow, let's find the size of this constructed cover, $|C|$. The vertices in $C$ are $v_2, v_4, v_6, \\dots$. The largest index is the largest even number less than or equal to $n$, which is $2 \\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor$. The number of elements in the set $\\{2, 4, \\dots, 2\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor\\}$ is $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor$.\nSo, we have found a vertex cover of size $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor$. This provides an upper bound on the minimum size:\n$$\\tau(P_n) \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor$$\n\nCombining our lower and upper bounds, we have:\n$$\\left\\lceil \\frac{n-1}{2} \\right\\rceil \\le \\tau(P_n) \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor$$\n\nLet's show that the lower and upper bounds are equal. We can analyze this using two cases based on the parity of $n$.\n\nCase 1: $n$ is even. Let $n = 2m$ for some integer $m \\ge 1$.\nThe lower bound is $\\lceil \\frac{2m-1}{2} \\rceil = \\lceil m - \\frac{1}{2} \\rceil = m$.\nThe upper bound is $\\lfloor \\frac{2m}{2} \\rfloor = \\lfloor m \\rfloor = m$.\nIn this case, the bounds are equal, so $\\tau(P_{2m}) = m = \\frac{n}{2}$.\n\nCase 2: $n$ is odd. Let $n = 2m+1$ for some integer $m \\ge 0$.\nThe lower bound is $\\lceil \\frac{(2m+1)-1}{2} \\rceil = \\lceil \\frac{2m}{2} \\rceil = \\lceil m \\rceil = m$.\nThe upper bound is $\\lfloor \\frac{2m+1}{2} \\rfloor = \\lfloor m + \\frac{1}{2} \\rfloor = m$.\nIn this case, the bounds are also equal, so $\\tau(P_{2m+1}) = m = \\frac{n-1}{2}$.\n\nWe now need a single expression that works for both cases.\nIf $n=2m$, then $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\frac{2m}{2} \\rfloor = m$. This matches our result for the even case.\nIf $n=2m+1$, then $\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\frac{2m+1}{2} \\rfloor = \\lfloor m + \\frac{1}{2} \\rfloor = m$.
