Your task is to identify the correct procedure for constructing a minimum edge cover $C$ for the tree $T$ using the given maximum matching $M$.\n\nWhich of the following describes a correct and general algorithm to construct a minimum edge cover of $T$ from a maximum matching $M$?\n\nA.

Let $U \\subseteq V$ be the set of vertices not covered by any edge of $M$ (the unmatched vertices). Let $u = |U|$ and $m = |M|$. Each edge in the matching $M$ covers two distinct vertices, so the number of vertices covered by $M$ is $2m$. The total number of vertices is $|V| = 2m + u$.\n\nA key property of a maximum matching in any graph is that the set of unmatched vertices, $U$, is an independent set. If there were an edge between two unmatched vertices $x, y \\in U$, then we could add the edge $\\{x,y\\}$ to $M$ to form a larger matching $M \\cup \\{\\{x,y\\}\\}$, contradicting the maximality of $M$.\n\nLet's analyze the construction in option A:\n1. Initialize the set $C$ with all edges from the maximum matching $M$. So, $C = M$. At this point, all vertices covered by $M$ are also covered by $C$. The only vertices that might be uncovered are those in $U$.\n2. For each vertex $v \\in U$, add to $C$ exactly one edge from $T$ that is incident to $v$. Such an edge must exist because a tree with at least two vertices has no isolated vertices.\n\n**Correctness:** The resulting set $C$ is an edge cover because all vertices covered by $M$ are covered by the initial step, and all unmatched vertices in $U$ are explicitly covered in the second step.\n\n**Minimality:** The size of our constructed cover is $|C| = |M| + |U| = m + u$. Since $|V| = 2m + u$, we can write $u = |V| - 2m$. Substituting this into the expression for $|C|$ gives:\n$$|C| = m + (|V| - 2m) = |V| - m.$$\nBy Gallai's Identity, the size of a minimum edge cover for any graph $T$ with no isolated vertices is $\\rho(T) = |V| - \\nu(T)$, where $\\nu(T)$ is the size of a maximum matching. Since $M$ is a maximum matching, $\\nu(T) = m = |M|$. Therefore, the minimum possible size for an edge cover is $|V| - m$. Our constructed cover $C$ has exactly this size, so it must be a minimum edge cover.\n\nLet's evaluate the other options:\n- B is false. For a path on three vertices ($v_1-v_2-v_3$), $M=\\{\\{v_1,v_2\\}\\}$ is a maximum matching of size 1. But the minimum edge cover is $\\{\\{v_1,v_2\\}, \\{v_2,v_3\\}\\}$, which has size 2.\n- C is false. Using the same path $v_1-v_2-v_3$, the edges not in $M$ are $\\{\\{v_2,v_3\\}\\}$. This set does not cover vertex $v_1$.\n- D is not generally a minimum cover. It may add too many edges and is not guaranteed to cover all vertices if there are vertices not incident to any edge in $M$.\n- E is not a correct general algorithm. For a star graph $K_{1,n-1}$, the leaves are all vertices except the center. Selecting one edge per leaf results in selecting all edges, which is a minimum edge cover for a star graph, but the procedure is not general. For other trees, this can lead to a non-minimal cover.\n\nTherefore, the correct and general algorithm is described in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1499864"}]}
