The devices are arranged in a logical ring topology, meaning each device, labeled $d_i$, can communicate directly only with its two immediate neighbors, $d_{i-1}$ and $d_{i+1}$ (indices are taken modulo $n$, so $d_{n+1}$ is $d_1$ and $d_0$ is $d_n$).\n\nA \"communication link\" is established when two adjacent devices pair up to exchange a large data packet. When a link is established, the two involved devices are considered \"occupied\" and cannot participate in any other communication link. The objective is to maximize the number of simultaneous, non-overlapping communication links across the entire network.\n\nDetermine a single, closed-form expression for the maximum number of communication links that can be active at any given moment, expressed in terms of $n$. Your expression should be valid for any integer $n \\ge 3$.", "solution": "First, we model this problem using graph theory. The $n$ devices can be represented as the vertices of a graph $G$, and the potential communication pathways between adjacent devices can be represented as the edges. Since the devices are in a ring topology where each device is connected to its two immediate neighbors, the resulting graph is a cycle graph on $n$ vertices, denoted $C_n$.\n\nA set of simultaneous, non-overlapping communication links corresponds to a set of edges in $C_n$ where no two edges share a common vertex. By definition, this is a matching in the graph. The problem asks for the maximum number of such links, which is equivalent to finding the size of a maximum matching in $C_n$. The size of a maximum matching is also known as the matching number, denoted $\\alpha'(G)$.\n\nWe can determine the value of $\\alpha'(C_n)$ by considering two cases based on the parity of $n$.\n\nCase 1: $n$ is an even integer.\nLet $n = 2k$ for some integer $k \\ge 2$ (since $n \\ge 3$, the smallest even $n$ is 4). Let the vertices be labeled consecutively $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_{2k}$ around the cycle. We can construct a matching by selecting every other edge along the cycle. For example, consider the set of edges $M = \\{\\{v_1, v_2\\}, \\{v_3, v_4\\}, \\dots, \\{v_{2k-1}, v_{2k}\\}\\}$. Each vertex $v_i$ appears in at most one edge in this set. For instance, $v_2$ is in $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$, but its other neighbor $v_3$ is paired with $v_4$, not $v_2$. This set $M$ is a valid matching. The number of edges in this matching is $k$. Since $n = 2k$, we have $k = n/2$. So, we have found a matching of size $n/2$.\nA matching of size $m$ involves $2m$ distinct vertices. In any graph with $n$ vertices, the size of any matching $m$ must satisfy $2m \\le n$, which implies $m \\le n/2$. Since we have found a matching of size $n/2$, this must be a maximum matching. Thus, for even $n$, $\\alpha'(C_n) = n/2$.\n\nCase 2: $n$ is an odd integer.\nLet $n = 2k+1$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$ (since $n \\ge 3$, the smallest odd $n$ is 3). Let the vertices be labeled $v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_{2k+1}$. We can try to construct a matching similarly to the even case. Consider the set of edges $M = \\{\\{v_1, v_2\\}, \\{v_3, v_4\\}, \\dots, \\{v_{2k-1}, v_{2k}\\}\\}$. This is a valid matching and its size is $k$. The vertices involved are $v_1, \\dots, v_{2k}$. The vertex $v_{2k+1}$ is left unmatched. The neighbors of $v_{2k+1}$ are $v_1$ and $v_{2k}$. Both of these vertices are already used in the matching $M$ (in edges $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$ and $\\{v_{2k-1}, v_{2k}\\}$ respectively), so no more edges can be added to $M$.\nThe size of this matching is $k$. Since $n = 2k+1$, we can express $k$ as $k = (n-1)/2$. So we have found a matching of size $(n-1)/2$.\nAs before, for any matching of size $m$, we must have $2m \\le n$. For odd $n=2k+1$, this means $2m \\le 2k+1$, which implies $m \\le k + 1/2$. Since $m$ must be an integer, the maximum possible size is $m \\le k$. We have constructed a matching of size $k$, so this is a maximum matching. Thus, for odd $n$, $\\alpha'(C_n) = (n-1)/2$.\n\nFinally, we combine both cases into a single closed-form expression.\nIf $n$ is even, $n=2k$, the maximum size is $k = n/2$.\nIf $n$ is odd, $n=2k+1$, the maximum size is $k = (n-1)/2$.\n\nWe can use the floor function, $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$, which gives the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$, to represent this result compactly.\nIf $n$ is even, $n=2k$, then $\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 2k/2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor k \\rfloor = k$. This matches our result.\nIf $n$ is odd, $n=2k+1$, then $\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor (2k+1)/2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor k + 0.5 \\rfloor = k$. This also matches our result.\n\nTherefore, for any integer $n \\ge 3$, the maximum number of simultaneous communication links is given by the expression $\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\rfloor}$$", "id": "1520409"}, {"introduction": "While knowing the size of a maximum matching is useful, finding one often requires an algorithm.
