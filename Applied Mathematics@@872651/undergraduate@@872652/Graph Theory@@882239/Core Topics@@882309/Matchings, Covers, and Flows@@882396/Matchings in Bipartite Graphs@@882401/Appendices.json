We construct an explicit matching of size $5$ by selecting the following edges:\n$$\nM=\\{\\{l_{2},r_{1}\\},\\{l_{4},r_{3}\\},\\{l_{1},r_{4}\\},\\{l_{3},r_{2}\\},\\{l_{5},r_{5}\\}\\}.\n$$\nThese edges are pairwise vertex-disjoint: the left endpoints are $l_{2},l_{4},l_{1},l_{3},l_{5}$ (all distinct) and the right endpoints are $r_{1},r_{3},r_{4},r_{2},r_{5}$ (all distinct). Therefore $M$ is a matching of size $5$. Since $m \\leq 5$ and there exists a matching of size $5$, it follows that $m=5$.\n\nTo find the cardinality $c$ of a minimum vertex cover, use the general inequality that in any graph, the size of a minimum vertex cover is at least the size of a maximum matching, because each edge in a matching is disjoint and requires at least one distinct vertex to cover it. Hence $c \\geq m=5$. On the other hand, the set $L$ itself is a vertex cover, since every edge in $E$ is incident to a vertex in $L$. Therefore there exists a vertex cover of size $|L|=5$, which implies $c \\leq 5$. Combining both inequalities yields $c=5$. This also agrees with Kőnig's theorem, which states that in bipartite graphs the size of a maximum matching equals the size of a minimum vertex cover.\n\nThus the required pair is $(m,c)=(5,5)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{(5, 5)}$$", "id": "1521177"}, {"introduction": "Moving from theory to application, this practice frames bipartite matching as a resource allocation problem, a common use case in the real world.

There are 8 interns, labeled $I_1, I_2, \\dots, I_8$, and 8 distinct summer projects, labeled $P_1, P_2, \\dots, P_8$. Due to varying skill sets, each intern is only eligible for a specific subset of the available projects.

Let $M_{1}$ be the number of matched edges incident to $S_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ the number incident to $S_{2}$. Because each project can be used at most once, we have $M_{1} \\le |S_{1}|=2$. Because every edge incident to $S_{2}$ must match a distinct intern from $B$ and each intern can be used at most once, we have $M_{2} \\le |B|=5$. Since $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ are disjoint and every matched edge uses exactly one project, the total obeys\n$$\nM=M_{1}+M_{2} \\le 2+5=7.\n$$\nThus no matching can exceed size $7$.\n\nWe now construct a matching of size $7$. Assign $I_{1} \\to P_{1}$ and $I_{3} \\to P_{2}$, which is feasible since $I_{1}$ is eligible only for $P_{1}$ and $I_{3}$ only for $P_{2}$. Then assign the five generalists $I_{4},I_{5},I_{6},I_{7},I_{8}$ to any five distinct projects among $P_{3},P_{4},P_{5},P_{6},P_{7},P_{8}$, which is feasible since each is eligible for any of these six projects.

This problem challenges you to analyze a simple greedy algorithm and compare its performance to an optimal solution, revealing a crucial insight into algorithmic design.

For a given integer parameter $k \\ge 1$, the system consists of two sets of nodes: a set of $2k$ \"provider\" nodes $A$ and a set of $2k$ \"requester\" nodes $B$. The nodes are grouped into $k$ independent clusters, indexed from $1$ to $k$. For each index $i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, k\\}$, cluster $i$ consists of two provider nodes, $\\{a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}\\}$, and two requester nodes, $\\{b_{i,1}, b_{i,2}\\}$.\n\nThe compatibility between providers and requesters within any cluster $i$ is defined as follows, forming a bipartite graph:\n1.  **Direct Links**: Node $a_{i,1}$ can serve node $b_{i,1}$, and node $a_{i,2}$ can serve node $b_{i,2}$. These form the set of direct links.\n2.  **Backup Link**: Node $a_{i,1}$ can also serve node $b_{i,2}$. This forms the set of backup links.\nThere are no other compatibilities; specifically, nodes from different clusters cannot be connected.\n\nThe system uses a simple, deterministic greedy algorithm for assignment. The algorithm prioritizes backup links over direct links. It operates in two sequential phases:\n- **Phase 1**: The algorithm iterates through all possible backup links in the entire system. For each backup link $(u, v)$ it considers, if both node $u$ and node $v$ are currently unassigned, it assigns them to each other.\n- **Phase 2**: After completing Phase 1, the algorithm iterates through all possible direct links. For each direct link $(u, v)$ it considers, if both node $u$ and node $v$ are currently unassigned, it assigns them to each other.\n\nThe order of consideration of links within each phase does not affect the outcome for this specific system architecture.

Let's analyze the number of assignments made by the greedy algorithm, $N_{greedy}(k)$, and the maximum possible number of assignments, $N_{opt}(k)$.\n\nFirst, let's formally define the bipartite graph $G_k = (L_k \\cup R_k, E_k)$ for a given $k \\ge 1$.\nThe two partitions of vertices are the provider nodes and requester nodes:\n$L_k = \\bigcup_{i=1}^{k} \\{a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}\\}$\n$R_k = \\bigcup_{i=1}^{k} \\{b_{i,1}, b_{i,2}\\}$\nThe size of each partition is $|L_k| = |R_k| = 2k$.\n\nThe edge set $E_k$ is composed of direct links and backup links.\nThe set of backup links is $E_{backup} = \\{ (a_{i,1}, b_{i,2}) \\mid i=1, \\ldots, k \\}$.\nThe set of direct links is $E_{direct} = \\{ (a_{i,1}, b_{i,1}), (a_{i,2}, b_{i,2}) \\mid i=1, \\ldots, k \\}$.\nThe total edge set is $E_k = E_{backup} \\cup E_{direct}$.

Let $M_G$ denote the matching constructed by the algorithm.\n\n**Phase 1: Process Backup Links**\nThe algorithm considers all edges in $E_{backup}$. Let's consider the edge $(a_{i,1}, b_{i,2})$ for an arbitrary cluster $i$. Initially, all nodes are unassigned. Since the clusters are disjoint, the assignment within one cluster does not affect the initial state of another.\nFor each $i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, k\\}$, the algorithm considers the backup link $(a_{i,1}, b_{i,2})$. Both nodes $a_{i,1}$ and $b_{i,2}$ are unassigned, so this edge is added to the matching $M_G$. This happens for every cluster $i$.\nAfter Phase 1 is complete, the matching consists of all backup links:\n$M_G = \\{ (a_{i,1}, b_{i,2}) \\mid i=1, \\ldots, k \\}$.\nAt this point, the size of the matching is $k$.\nThe set of assigned nodes are:\n- From partition $L_k$: $\\{a_{1,1}, a_{2,1}, \\ldots, a_{k,1}\\}$\n- From partition $R_k$: $\\{b_{1,2}, b_{2,2}, \\ldots, b_{k,2}\\}$\n\n**Phase 2: Process Direct Links**\nThe algorithm now considers all edges in $E_{direct}$. An edge can only be added if both its endpoints are unassigned.\nThe direct links are of two types for each cluster $i$: $(a_{i,1}, b_{i,1})$ and $(a_{i,2}, b_{i,2})$.\n- For the link $(a_{i,1}, b_{i,1})$: The node $a_{i,1}$ was already assigned in Phase 1 to $b_{i,2}$. Therefore, this link cannot be added to the matching.\n- For the link $(a_{i,2}, b_{i,2})$: The node $b_{i,2}$ was already assigned in Phase 1 to $a_{i,1}$. Therefore, this link cannot be added to the matching.\nThis holds true for all $i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, k\\}$. Thus, no new edges are added to the matching in Phase 2.\n\nThe final matching produced by the greedy algorithm is $M_G = \\{ (a_{i,1}, b_{i,2}) \\mid i=1, \\ldots, k \\}$.\nThe size of this matching is $N_{greedy}(k) = |M_G| = k$.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the size of the maximum matching, $N_{opt}(k)$.**\nThe graph $G_k$ is a disjoint union of $k$ identical subgraphs, one for each cluster $i$. The maximum matching of $G_k$ is the union of the maximum matchings of these subgraphs. Let's find the maximum matching for a single cluster $i$.\nThe subgraph for cluster $i$ has nodes $\\{a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}\\}$ and $\\{b_{i,1}, b_{i,2}\\}$ and edges $(a_{i,1}, b_{i,1}), (a_{i,2}, b_{i,2}), (a_{i,1}, b_{i,2})$.\nWe can find a perfect matching in this subgraph, for example, by choosing the two direct links:\n$M_i^* = \\{ (a_{i,1}, b_{i,1}), (a_{i,2}, b_{i,2}) \\}$.\nThis matching covers all four nodes in the subgraph for cluster $i$. Its size is 2. Since a perfect matching covers all vertices, it must be a maximum matching for the subgraph. The size of the maximum matching for one cluster is 2.\n\nTo find the maximum matching for the entire graph $G_k$, we sum the sizes of the maximum matchings for each of the $k$ disjoint clusters.\n$N_{opt}(k) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} |M_i^*| = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} 2 = 2k$.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the performance ratio.**\nThe performance ratio is the size of the optimal matching divided by the size of the greedy matching.\n$$ \\text{Performance Ratio} = \\frac{N_{opt}(k)}{N_{greedy}(k)} = \\frac{2k}{k} = 2 $$\nThe ratio is 2, independent of the value of $k$ (for $k \\ge 1$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "1520052"}]}
