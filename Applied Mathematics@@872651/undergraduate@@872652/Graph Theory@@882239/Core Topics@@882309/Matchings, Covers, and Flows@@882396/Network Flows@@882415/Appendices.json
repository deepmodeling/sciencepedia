The nodes are a source depot (S), a destination city (T), and four intermediate transfer hubs (U, V, W, X).

Starting at $S$, its neighbors with positive residuals are $U$ and $V$, enqueued as $U$ then $V$. Processing $U$ next, and exploring its neighbors in alphabetical order, we encounter $W$ via $U \\to W$ since $r(U,W)=1>0$, so we enqueue $W$. Processing $V$ next, we enqueue $X$ via $V \\to X$ since $r(V,X)=2>0$. Processing $W$ next, we discover $T$ via $W \\to T$ since $r(W,T)=3>0$.
