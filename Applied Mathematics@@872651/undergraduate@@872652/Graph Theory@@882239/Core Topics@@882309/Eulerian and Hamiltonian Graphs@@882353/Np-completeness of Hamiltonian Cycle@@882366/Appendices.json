This final practice presents a thought experiment: if you had a \"black-box\" oracle that could only answer \"yes\" or \"no\" to whether a Hamiltonian path exists, could you use it to find the actual path? This technique, known as self-reduction, is a cornerstone concept demonstrating why finding a solution to an NP-complete problem is typically no harder than just deciding if one exists [@problem_id:1524648].", "problem": "A bioinformatics research team is working on a new method for genome assembly. The process involves reconstructing a full Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence from a large collection of shorter DNA fragments. This reconstruction problem can be modeled using a directed graph, $G = (N, A)$, where the set of nodes $N$ represents the DNA fragments, and the set of directed arcs $A$ represents potential overlaps between pairs of fragments (an arc from fragment $u$ to fragment $v$ means $v$ can follow $u$). A successful assembly of the entire genome corresponds to finding a Hamiltonian path in this graph, which is a path that visits every node exactly once.\n\nThe team has access to a powerful, but costly, proprietary software library. This library provides a single \"black-box\" function, `hasHamiltonianPath(G')`, which takes a directed graph `G'` as input. It returns `True` if `G'` contains at least one Hamiltonian path, and `False` otherwise. The function provides no information about the path itself, only its existence.\n\nYou are tasked with devising a procedure that uses this `hasHamiltonianPath` function to determine the exact sequence of arcs that form a single, complete Hamiltonian path. Your procedure must work for any given directed graph $G=(N,A)$ which is guaranteed to contain at least one Hamiltonian path. The licensing agreement for the software bills per function call, so your primary goal is to determine the upper bound on the number of calls required.\n\nWhat is the maximum number of times your procedure would need to call the `hasHamiltonianPath` function to construct one full Hamiltonian path for a graph with $|N|=V$ vertices and $|A|=E$ arcs? Express your answer as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $V$ and $E$.", "solution": "We are given a directed graph $G=(N,A)$ with $|N|=V$ vertices and $|A|=E$ arcs, guaranteed to contain at least one Hamiltonian path (HP), and access to an oracle function $\\mathrm{hasHamiltonianPath}(\\cdot)$ that decides existence of a HP. The goal is to recover the exact set of arcs of one Hamiltonian path while minimizing the number of oracle calls, and to bound the maximum number of calls required.\n\nDefine the following self-reduction procedure. Fix any ordering of the arcs $A=\\{e_{1},e_{2},\\dots,e_{E}\\}$. Initialize $H_{0}=G$. For $i=1,2,\\dots,E$, do:\n- If $e_{i}\\notin A(H_{i-1})$, set $H_{i}=H_{i-1}$ and make no oracle call.\n- If $e_{i}\\in A(H_{i-1})$, query the oracle on $H_{i-1}\\setminus\\{e_{i}\\}$.

Otherwise, set $H_{i}=H_{i-1}$ (keep $e_{i}$).\n\nAfter completing all $E$ iterations, output the remaining graph $H_{E}$ by listing its arcs; this is the recovered Hamiltonian path.\n\nWe justify correctness and bound the number of oracle calls.\n\nInvariant (preservation of Hamiltonicity): For every $i$, the graph $H_{i}$ has at least one Hamiltonian path. This holds by induction: it is true for $H_{0}=G$ by assumption. At each step, if we delete $e_{i}$ then the deletion is made only when $\\mathrm{hasHamiltonianPath}(H_{i-1}\\setminus\\{e_{i}\\})=\\mathrm{True}$, so $H_{i}$ still has a HP; otherwise we do not delete $e_{i}$ and clearly preserve any existing HP.\n\nMinimality at termination: Let $H^{\\star}=H_{E}$. By construction, for every arc $f\\in A(H^{\\star})$ we must have $\\mathrm{hasHamiltonianPath}(H^{\\star}\\setminus\\{f\\})=\\mathrm{False}$; otherwise that arc would have been deleted when it was considered. Therefore $H^{\\star}$ is minimal with respect to edge deletion among subgraphs that still admit a Hamiltonian path.\n\nStructure of a minimal HP-containing subgraph: We claim that $H^{\\star}$ consists of exactly the arcs of a single Hamiltonian path, hence $|A(H^{\\star})|=V-1$ and the arcs of that unique path are precisely the output.\n\nProof: First, $H^{\\star}$ cannot contain two distinct Hamiltonian paths. If it did, there would exist an arc $a$ used by one of the paths but not by the other. Then $H^{\\star}\\setminus\\{a\\}$ would still contain a Hamiltonian path (the one avoiding $a$), contradicting minimality. Hence $H^{\\star}$ has a unique HP $P$. Second, $H^{\\star}$ cannot contain any arc not belonging to $P$, because deleting such an arc would leave $P$ intact and thus preserve a HP, again contradicting minimality. Therefore every arc of $H^{\\star}$ lies on $P$, which implies $A(H^{\\star})$ is exactly the $V-1$ arcs of $P$.\n\nNumber of oracle calls: We call the oracle at most once for each $e_{i}$ with $e_{i}\\in A(H_{i-1})$. Since we process each of the $E$ original arcs in a fixed order and never re-test any arc, the number of oracle calls is at most $E$. We do not need an initial call on $G$, because the problem guarantees that $G$ is Hamiltonian; all intermediate calls are exactly those used to decide deletions. Thus the maximum number of calls required by this procedure to construct one full Hamiltonian path is $E$.\n\nTherefore, an explicit closed-form upper bound in terms of $V$ and $E$ is $E$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "1524648"}]}
