By analyzing a proposed network of bike paths, you'll practice identifying this key property and see how a seemingly complex routing problem can be solved with a single, elegant rule.", "problem": "A city's parks and recreation department is designing a new network of bicycle paths to connect five major landmarks. The paths are designed such that they only intersect at these landmarks. A key goal for the department is to create a \"grand tour\" route for a promotional cycling event. This tour must start at one of the landmarks, travel along every single bike path exactly once, and end at the same landmark from which it started.\n\nThe design specifies that the entire network of paths is connected, meaning it is possible to travel from any landmark to any other. A survey of the proposed network provides the number of paths that meet at each of the five landmarks. This collection of numbers, known as the degree sequence, is {2, 2, 4, 4, 4}.\n\nBased only on this information, is the existence of such a \"grand tour\" guaranteed?

This type of tour is formally known as an Eulerian circuit.\n\nWe can model the scenario using graph theory. The landmarks represent the vertices of a graph, and the bicycle paths represent the edges. The problem provides the following information:\n1.  The graph is connected.\n2.  The graph has 5 vertices.\n3.  The degrees of the vertices are given by the set {2, 2, 4, 4, 4}. A vertex's degree is the number of edges connected to it, which corresponds to the number of paths meeting at a landmark.\n\nEuler's theorem provides a definitive criterion for the existence of an Eulerian circuit. The theorem states: A connected graph has an Eulerian circuit if and only if every vertex in the graph has an even degree.\n\nLet's apply this theorem to the given problem.\n\nFirst, we check the connectivity condition. The problem explicitly states that the \"network of paths is connected.\" This condition is met.\n\nSecond, we check the degree condition. The degrees of the five vertices (landmarks) are given as {2, 2, 4, 4, 4}. Each number in this set (2 and 4) is an even integer. Therefore, every vertex in the graph has an even degree.\n\nSince both conditions of Euler's theorem are satisfied (the graph is connected, and all its vertices have even degrees), the existence of an Eulerian circuit is guaranteed.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n\nA. Yes, because every landmark has an even number of paths connected to it.\nThis statement correctly identifies that all vertices have even degrees, which, for a connected graph, is the sufficient condition for the existence of an Eulerian circuit. This is the correct conclusion.\n\nB. No, because it is impossible to determine the tour's existence without knowing the specific layout of the paths between landmarks.\nThis is incorrect. Euler's theorem demonstrates that the existence of an Eulerian circuit depends only on the connectivity of the graph and the degrees of its vertices, not on the specific arrangement of edges (i.e., the graph's specific isomorphism class).\n\nC. No, because the total number of paths in the network is odd.\nTo check this, we use the handshaking lemma, which states that the sum of the degrees of the vertices is equal to twice the number of edges.\nSum of degrees = $2 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 16$.\nNumber of edges (paths) = (Sum of degrees) / 2 = $16 / 2 = 8$.\nThe total number of paths is 8, which is an even number. Thus, the premise of this option is false.\n\nD. Yes, because the network is connected and contains at least four landmarks.\nWhile it is true that the network is connected, the number of vertices (as long as it's greater than 0) is not the determining factor for the existence of an Eulerian circuit. The crucial part is the degree of each vertex. Therefore, this reasoning is incorrect.\n\nE. It cannot be determined, because the given conditions are necessary but not sufficient for the existence of such a tour.\nThis is incorrect. For a connected graph, the condition that all vertices have even degrees is both necessary and sufficient for the existence of an Eulerian circuit.\n\nBased on the analysis, option A provides the correct conclusion and reasoning.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1502078"}, {"introduction": "Moving from analysis to design, this exercise [@problem_id:1502045] puts you in the role of an engineer planning an efficient route for a street-sweeping vehicle.
