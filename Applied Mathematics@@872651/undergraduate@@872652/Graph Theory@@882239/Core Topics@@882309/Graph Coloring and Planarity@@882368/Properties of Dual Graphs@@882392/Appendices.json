In $C_n$, every edge lies on the boundary between the interior and the exterior faces, so each of the $n$ edges yields one dual edge between the same two dual vertices.\n- No edge of $C_n$ lies on the boundary of only one face, so no self-loops appear in $G^{*}$.\n\nTherefore, $G^{*}$ is a multigraph with two vertices joined by $n$ parallel edges.

The design strategy involves partitioning the entire plane into a finite number of non-overlapping polygonal regions. This partition, known as the *primal map*, is specifically constructed to be a *plane triangulation*. This means that every region, including the single unbounded exterior region, is a triangle bounded by exactly three edges.\n\nWithin each triangular region of this primal map, a single data processing hub is placed. To facilitate data sharing, a communication network, called the *hub network*, is established. The hub network is a graph where each hub is a vertex. An edge exists between two vertices in the hub network if and only if their corresponding triangular regions in the primal map share a common boundary edge.\n\nThe choice of routing hardware for each hub depends critically on the number of direct communication links connected to it, which corresponds to the degree of its vertex in the hub network graph. Given this setup, which of the following statements is universally true for the degree of any vertex in any possible hub network constructed according to this design, regardless of the specific size or shape of the triangular regions?\n\nA. The degree of every vertex is 3.\n\nB. The degree of every vertex is 4.\n\nC. The degree of every vertex is 6.\n\nD. The minimum degree is 2 and the maximum degree is 4.\n\nE.

The degree of a vertex is not constant and varies depending on the geometry of the specific triangulation.", "solution": "We formalize the setup using planar graph duality. Let the primal map be a finite plane triangulation: a connected planar graph embedded in the plane such that every face, including the unbounded exterior face, is bounded by exactly three edges.\n\nConstruct the hub network as the dual graph: place a vertex in each face of the primal, and join two dual vertices by an edge if and only if the corresponding faces in the primal share a boundary edge. Let $f$ be any face in the primal, and let $v_{f}$ be the corresponding vertex in the dual.\n\nWe analyze $\\deg(v_{f})$:\n1. By definition of triangulation, the boundary of $f$ consists of exactly three distinct edges. Denote them by $e_{1}, e_{2}, e_{3}$.\n2. In a plane embedding of a finite graph, each edge is incident with exactly two faces (one on each side). Thus, for each $i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$, the edge $e_{i}$ is shared by $f$ and exactly one other face, say $f_{i}$.\n3. In a triangulation, no edge can be a bridge: if an edge were a bridge, it would not lie on any cycle; however, since it is incident to two triangular faces, it lies on a $3$-cycle, contradicting the definition of a bridge. Hence no dual loops occur, and each $e_{i}$ yields an adjacency to some $f_{i} \\neq f$.\n4. In a triangulation of a simple planar graph, two distinct faces cannot share more than one edge; otherwise, those two edges would bound a $2$-face, contradicting the triangulation property. Therefore, the three neighbors $f_{1}, f_{2}, f_{3}$ are pairwise distinct.\n5. By the definition of the dual, $\\deg(v_{f})$ equals the number of faces adjacent to $f$ via edge-sharing, which is exactly three, one per boundary edge.\n\nThus, for every face $f$ (including the unbounded exterior face), the corresponding dual vertex $v_{f}$ has degree\n$$\n\\deg(v_{f})=3.\n$$\nTherefore, in the hub network (dual graph), every vertex has degree $3$, independent of geometry or whether the face is bounded or unbounded.\n\nHence, the universally true statement is that the degree of every vertex is $3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1528841"}, {"introduction": "The concept of duality becomes a powerful analytical tool when we learn to work backwards—using properties of a dual graph to deduce information about the original.
