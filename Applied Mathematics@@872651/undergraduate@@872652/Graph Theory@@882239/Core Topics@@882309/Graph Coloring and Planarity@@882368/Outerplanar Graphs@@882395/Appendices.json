Draw the star edges $(v_{5},v_{i})$ for $i \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}$ as straight diagonals from $v_{5}$ to each $v_{i}$. These diagonals share the common endpoint $v_{5}$ and therefore do not cross each other, and in a convex polygon a diagonal does not cross any boundary edge except at a common endpoint. Hence there is a planar drawing with all vertices on the boundary of the outer face, so the graph is outerplanar.

The degrees are $\\deg(1)=\\deg(3)=\\deg(5)=4$ and $\\deg(2)=\\deg(4)=\\deg(6)=2$, so there is no vertex of degree $5$. Hence C is false.\n\nFor statement D (minimum degree is $3$), note that in any triangulation of an $n$-gon there are at least two ears (triangles using two boundary edges), which correspond to vertices of degree $2$.

Hence the minimum degree need not be $3$, so D is false.\n\nFor statement E (not $2$-connected), observe that maximal outerplanar graphs on $n \\geq 3$ vertices are $2$-connected; equivalently, they contain a Hamiltonian outer cycle through all vertices, so removing any single vertex leaves the remaining vertices connected via the path along the outer cycle.

Another fundamental operation on a graph is *edge contraction*. Contracting an edge $e = \\{u, v\\}$ consists of removing the edge and merging its two endpoints, $u$ and $v$, into a single new vertex. This new vertex is adjacent to all vertices that were previously adjacent to either $u$ or $v$. If this process creates multiple edges between the new vertex and some other vertex, they are merged into a single edge.\n\nConsider the following proposition: \"For any simple, undirected outerplanar graph $G$, contracting any single edge $e$ in $G$ results in a graph, denoted $G/e$, that is also outerplanar.\"\n\nEvaluate this proposition and select the most accurate statement from the choices below.\n\nA.

We need to evaluate whether contracting an edge in an outerplanar graph always results in another outerplanar graph.\n\nLet's begin by recalling a powerful characterization of outerplanar graphs. A graph is outerplanar if and only if it does not contain the complete graph $K_4$ or the complete bipartite graph $K_{2,3}$ as a minor. This is a well-known result in graph theory, analogous to Kuratowski's theorem for planar graphs.\n\nNext, we must understand the concept of a graph minor. A graph $H$ is a minor of a graph $G$ if $H$ can be obtained from a subgraph of $G$ by a sequence of edge contractions. The operations that can be used to form a minor from a graph $G$ are:\n1.  **Edge Deletion:** Removing an edge from the graph.\n2.  **Vertex Deletion:** Removing a vertex (and all incident edges) from the graph.\n3.  **Edge Contraction:** Removing an edge $e = \\{u,v\\}$ and merging vertices $u$ and $v$ into a single new vertex.\n\nThe problem describes forming a graph $G/e$ by contracting a single edge $e$ from a graph $G$. By the very definition of a graph minor, the resulting graph $G/e$ is a minor of the original graph $G$.\n\nNow we can combine these two concepts to solve the problem.\nLet $G$ be an arbitrary outerplanar graph.\nAccording to the minor-based characterization, because $G$ is outerplanar, it cannot contain $K_4$ or $K_{2,3}$ as a minor.\n\nLet $e$ be an arbitrary edge in $G$, and let $G/e$ be the graph resulting from the contraction of $e$. As established, $G/e$ is a minor of $G$.\n\nLet's assume, for the sake of contradiction, that the resulting graph $G/e$ is *not* outerplanar.\nIf $G/e$ is not outerplanar, then by the same characterization theorem, $G/e$ must contain either $K_4$ or $K_{2,3}$ as a minor.\n\nLet's say $G/e$ contains $K_4$ as a minor. This means we can obtain $K_4$ from $G/e$ by a sequence of vertex deletions, edge deletions, and edge contractions.\nSo, we have the following relationships:\n1.  $G/e$ is a minor of $G$.\n2.  $K_4$ is a minor of $G/e$.\n\nThe \"is a minor of\" relationship is transitive. If a graph $H_1$ is a minor of $H_2$, and $H_2$ is a minor of $H_3$, then $H_1$ is also a minor of $H_3$. In our case, this implies that $K_4$ must be a minor of $G$.\n\nHowever, this leads to a contradiction. Our initial premise was that $G$ is an outerplanar graph. A graph being outerplanar specifically means it does *not* have $K_4$ (or $K_{2,3}$) as a minor.\n\nThe same logic applies if we assume $G/e$ contains $K_{2,3}$ as a minor. This would imply $K_{2,3}$ is a minor of $G$, again contradicting that $G$ is outerplanar.\n\nSince our assumption (that $G/e$ is not outerplanar) leads to a contradiction, the assumption must be false. Therefore, the graph $G/e$ must always be outerplanar.\n\nThis proves that the proposition \"For any simple, undirected outerplanar graph $G$, contracting any single edge $e$ in $G$ results in a graph, denoted $G/e$, that is also outerplanar\" is always true. The class of outerplanar graphs is \"minor-closed,\" meaning that any minor of an outerplanar graph is also outerplanar.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct statement. Options B, C, D, and E are incorrect because they posit conditions or falsehoods for a property that is universally true for all outerplanar graphs and all possible edge contractions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1525455"}]}
