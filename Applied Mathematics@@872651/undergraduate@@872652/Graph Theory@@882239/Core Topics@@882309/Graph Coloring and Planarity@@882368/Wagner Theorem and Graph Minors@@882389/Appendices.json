This first exercise focuses on edge contraction, a powerful tool for simplifying a graph to reveal its core structure. By systematically contracting edges in the famous Petersen graph, you will directly see how a non-planar graph can contain the complete graph $K_5$ as a minor, providing a concrete illustration of Wagner's theorem in action [@problem_id:1554462].", "problem": "In graph theory, the Petersen graph is a well-known structure with interesting properties. Let's define the Petersen graph, $P$, using a common construction. Its set of 10 vertices is partitioned into two sets: an \"outer\" set $V_{out} = \\{v_0, v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4\\}$ and an \"inner\" set $V_{in} = \\{u_0, u_1, u_2, u_3, u_4\\}$. The 15 edges of the graph are defined as follows, where all indices are considered modulo 5:\n1.  **Outer edges**: An edge exists between $v_i$ and $v_{i+1}$ for $i \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. These form a 5-cycle.\n2.  **Spoke edges**: An edge exists between $v_i$ and $u_i$ for $i \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n3.  **Inner edges**: An edge exists between $u_i$ and $u_{i+2}$ for $i \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. These form a 5-pointed star.\n\nAn important operation in graph theory is edge contraction. When an edge $(a,b)$ is contracted, the two vertices $a$ and $b$ are merged into a single new vertex, let's call it $w$. This new vertex $w$ is connected to every vertex that was a neighbor of either $a$ or $b$ (except for $a$ and $b$ themselves). The resulting graph is simplified, meaning if multiple edges form between the same two vertices as a result of the contraction, they are considered a single edge.\n\nConsider the graph $P'$ that results from contracting all five \"spoke\" edges of the Petersen graph, i.e., the set of edges $\\{(v_0, u_0), (v_1, u_1), (v_2, u_2), (v_3, u_3), (v_4, u_4)\\}$. This operation produces a new graph with 5 vertices.\n\nDetermine the total number of edges in the resulting graph $P'$.", "solution": "Define the contraction map $f$ from the vertex set of $P$ to the vertex set of $P'$ by $f(v_{i})=f(u_{i})=w_{i}$ for $i \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$, so $P'$ has vertices $\\{w_{0},w_{1},w_{2},w_{3},w_{4}\\}$. By the definition of edge contraction in simple graphs, for each edge $(x,y)$ of $P$ with $f(x) \\neq f(y)$, there is a single edge between $f(x)$ and $f(y)$ in $P'$; loops are discarded and parallel edges are simplified to a single edge.\n\nEnumerate the images of the three edge families of $P$ under $f$:\n1. Outer edges: Each edge $(v_{i},v_{i+1})$ maps to $(w_{i},w_{i+1})$. These yield the set $\\{\\{w_{i},w_{i+1}\\} : i \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{5}\\}$, consisting of $5$ distinct unordered pairs.\n2. Spoke edges: Each edge $(v_{i},u_{i})$ maps to a loop at $w_{i}$, which is discarded in the contraction. Hence they contribute no edges to $P'$.\n3. Inner edges: Each edge $(u_{i},u_{i+2})$ maps to $(w_{i},w_{i+2})$. These yield the set $\\{\\{w_{i},w_{i+2}\\} : i \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{5}\\}$, consisting of $5$ distinct unordered pairs.\n\nWe verify there are no duplications between the two families that survive:\n- Distinctness within each family holds since $\\{\\{i,i+1\\} : i \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{5}\\}$ and $\\{\\{i,i+2\\} : i \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{5}\\}$ are $5$-element sets of unordered pairs.\n- No outer edge coincides with an inner edge: if $\\{i,i+1\\}=\\{j,j+2\\}$ in $\\mathbb{Z}_{5}$, then either $i=j$ and $i+1=j+2$, which implies $1\\equiv 2 \\pmod{5}$ (impossible), or $i=j+2$ and $i+1=j$, which implies $1\\equiv -2 \\pmod{5}$, i.e., $3\\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$ (also impossible). Hence the two families are disjoint.\n\nTherefore $P'$ has exactly $5+5=10$ edges. Equivalently, each $w_{i}$ is adjacent to $w_{i\\pm 1}$ and $w_{i\\pm 2}$, so $P'$ is isomorphic to the complete graph $K_{5}$, which has $\\binom{5}{2}=10$ edges.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10}$$", "id": "1554462"}, {"introduction": "While edge contractions provide a procedural way to find minors, an alternative and often more intuitive approach is to identify a 'minor model.' This involves finding disjoint connected regions in a larger graph that act like the vertices of the smaller graph. This practice challenges you to find a minor model of the complete bipartite graph $K_{2,3}$ within a simple grid graph, shifting your perspective from graph manipulation to structural pattern recognition [@problem_id:1554448].", "problem": "In graph theory, we are often interested in the structural relationships between different graphs. One such relationship is the concept of a graph minor. A graph $H$ is said to be a minor of another graph $G$ if $H$ can be obtained from $G$ by a sequence of vertex deletions, edge deletions, and edge contractions.\n\nAn equivalent and more intuitive way to demonstrate that a graph $H$ is a minor of a graph $G$ is to find a \"minor model\" of $H$ in $G$. This involves identifying a collection of vertex-disjoint, connected subgraphs in $G$, one for each vertex of $H$. Let the vertices of $H$ be $\\{h_1, h_2, \\dots, h_k\\}$.
