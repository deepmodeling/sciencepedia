For a distributed synchronization task, every server must exchange a data packet with every other server exactly once. The network architecture is a fully-connected topology, where a direct link exists between any two servers. The communication protocol is synchronous, meaning data exchanges are grouped into non-overlapping time slots or \"rounds\". In any single round, a server can participate in at most one data exchange (i.e., communicate with one other server). The engineering challenge is to determine the minimum total number of rounds required to complete all unique pairwise data exchanges for a given number of servers $n$.\n\nThis scheduling problem can be modeled using graph theory. The servers are represented as vertices and the required data exchanges as edges. Since every server must communicate with every other, the graph is a complete graph $K_n$, where an edge exists between every pair of distinct vertices. The rounds of communication correspond to assigning a \"color\" to each edge, where all edges of the same color represent exchanges occurring in the same round. The constraint that a server can only participate in one exchange per round means that no two edges sharing a common vertex can have the same color.
