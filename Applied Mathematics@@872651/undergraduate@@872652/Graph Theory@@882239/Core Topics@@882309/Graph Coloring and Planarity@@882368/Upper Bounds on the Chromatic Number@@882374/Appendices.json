The Welsh-Powell algorithm is a classic \"greedy\" strategy that provides a systematic way to color a graph. This practice walks you through its step-by-step application, where vertices are prioritized based on their degree, offering a tangible way to find a valid coloring and thus an upper bound for $\\chi(G)$ [@problem_id:1552856].", "problem": "Consider an undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ with the vertex set $V = \\{A, B, C, D, E, F, G\\}$ and the edge set $E$ containing the following pairs:\n$E = \\{(A, B), (A, C), (A, D), (A, F), (B, C), (B, D), (B, E), (C, E), (C, F), (D, G), (E, G)\\}$.\n\nThe Welsh-Powell algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find a coloring of a graph. It provides an upper bound for the chromatic number of the graph. The steps of the algorithm are as follows:\n1.  Compute the degree of each vertex in the graph.\n2.  List the vertices in descending order of their degrees. In cases of a tie in degree, vertices should be ordered alphabetically.\n3.  Assign the first color to the first vertex in the sorted list.\n4.  Iterate through the rest of the sorted list of vertices. For each vertex, if it is not adjacent to any vertex already colored with the current color, assign this color to it.\n5.  If there are still uncolored vertices, choose the first uncolored vertex in the sorted list and assign a new, second color to it.\n6.  Repeat the process described in step 4 for all uncolored vertices with the new color.\n7.  Continue this process, introducing a new color each time all remaining uncolored vertices are adjacent to at least one vertex of the current color, until all vertices are colored.\n\nBy applying the Welsh-Powell algorithm to the graph $G$, determine the total number of colors used to achieve a valid coloring.

Traverse the list; a vertex can receive color 1 if it is non-adjacent to all color-1 vertices. $B,C,D,F$ are adjacent to $A$ and cannot receive color 1; $E$ is not adjacent to $A$ and receives color 1; $G$ is adjacent to $E$ and thus cannot receive color 1. After this pass, color 1 is on $\\{A,E\\}$.\n\nSecond color: the first uncolored vertex in the order is $B$, assign color 2 to $B$. Continue traversal: $C$ is adjacent to $B$ so skip; $D$ is adjacent to $B$ so skip; $F$ is non-adjacent to $B$ and gets color 2; $G$ is non-adjacent to both $B$ and $F$ and gets color 2. After this pass, color 2 is on $\\{B,F,G\\}$.\n\nThird color: remaining uncolored vertices are $C$ and $D$. Assign color 3 to $C$, then check $D$; since there is no edge between $C$ and $D$, $D$ also receives color 3. After this pass, all vertices are colored with colors $\\{1,2,3\\}$.\n\nThus, the Welsh-Powell algorithm uses a total of $3$ colors on this graph.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "1552856"}, {"introduction": "While algorithms like Welsh-Powell use a specific vertex ordering, the performance of any greedy coloring algorithm is fundamentally tied to the order in which vertices are processed. This exercise provides a striking demonstration of this principle. By applying the greedy algorithm to the same graph using two different vertex orderings, you will see how a \"good\" ordering can find an optimal coloring, while a \"bad\" one can yield a result that is far from optimal, reinforcing why these algorithms provide an upper bound, not always the exact chromatic number [@problem_id:1552858].", "problem": "Consider a family of graphs, which we will call Staggered Bipartite Graphs, denoted by $S_n$ for any integer $n \\ge 2$.

There are no edges connecting vertices within the set $\\{a_1, \\ldots, a_n\\}$, nor within the set $\\{b_1, \\ldots, b_n\\}$.\n\nThe greedy coloring algorithm colors a graph by processing its vertices one by one according to a specified ordering. For each vertex, it assigns the smallest positive integer color that has not already been used by any of its previously colored neighbors.\n\nLet's consider two different vertex orderings for $S_n$:\n1. Ordering $\\pi_1$: The vertices are ordered by first listing all 'a' vertices and then all 'b' vertices: $(a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n, b_1, b_2, \\dots, b_n)$.\n2.

There are no edges within $A$ or within $B$. The greedy coloring assigns to each vertex, in a given order, the smallest positive integer not used by any of its previously colored neighbors.\n\nFirst consider ordering $\\pi_{1}=(a_{1},\\dots,a_{n},b_{1},\\dots,b_{n})$.\n- For each $a_{i}$, when it is processed, none of its neighbors are colored yet because all neighbors of $a_{i}$ lie in $B$, which appears later in the order. Hence, each $a_{i}$ receives color $1$.\n- For each $b_{j}$, its previously colored neighbors are all $a_{i}$ with $i\\neq j$, and all of those have color $1$. Therefore color $1$ is forbidden and the smallest available color is $2$. Since there are no edges among vertices of $B$, each $b_{j}$ also takes color $2$.\nThus the greedy algorithm uses exactly $k_{1}=2$ colors under $\\pi_{1}$.\n\nNext consider ordering $\\pi_{2}=(a_{1},b_{1},a_{2},b_{2},\\dots,a_{n},b_{n})$.\nWe proceed inductively on $i$ to show that for each $i$, both $a_{i}$ and $b_{i}$ receive color $i$.\n- Base case $i=1$: $a_{1}$ has no previously colored neighbors, so it gets color $1$. Then $b_{1}$ has no edge to $a_{1}$, so it also has no previously colored neighbors and receives color $1$.\n- Inductive step: Assume for $1\\leq m\\leq i-1$ that $a_{m}$ and $b_{m}$ both have color $m$. When processing $a_{i}$, its previously colored neighbors are exactly $b_{1},\\dots,b_{i-1}$ (since $b_{j}$ is adjacent to $a_{i}$ for $j\\neq i$). By the inductive hypothesis, these neighbors use the colors $1,2,\\dots,i-1$, so the smallest available color for $a_{i}$ is $i$. Next, for $b_{i}$, its previously colored neighbors are exactly $a_{1},\\dots,a_{i-1}$ (since $a_{j}$ is adjacent to $b_{i}$ for $j\\neq i$), which by the inductive hypothesis have colors $1,2,\\dots,i-1$. Therefore the smallest available color for $b_{i}$ is also $i$.\nBy induction, when $i=n$, the algorithm has used precisely the colors $1,2,\\dots,n$, so $k_{2}=n$.\n\nTherefore the ratio is\n$$\n\\frac{k_{2}}{k_{1}}=\\frac{n}{2}.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{n}{2}}$$", "id": "1552858"}, {"introduction": "Beyond coloring existing graphs, a deeper understanding comes from seeing how chromatic numbers behave when we construct new graphs from old ones.
