The graph $G$ is known to be simple (contains no loops or multiple edges between the same two vertices) and connected. Furthermore, $G$ is a planar graph, meaning it can be drawn in a plane without any edges crossing. An analysis of the graph's structure reveals that the number of edges is exactly 7 more than the number of vertices. Given these properties, determine the number of faces (including the unbounded outer face) in any planar embedding of $G$.", "solution": "We are given a simple, connected, planar graph with vertex set of size $v$ and edge set of size $e$, and the relation $e=v+7$.

The design features $v = 12$ skyscrapers that are to be connected by a network of $e = 32$ direct, non-intersecting sky-bridges. The resulting network of skyscrapers (nodes) and sky-bridges (links) is intended to be connected, meaning it's possible to travel from any skyscraper to any other.\n\nA fundamental theorem in network topology, which is used to assess the feasibility of such two-dimensional layouts, states that for any simple, connected planar graph with $v$ vertices and $e$ edges, the inequality $e \\leq 3v - 6$ must hold, provided that $v \\geq 3$. A simple graph is one with no loops (edges connecting a vertex to itself) and no more than one edge between any pair of vertices. The sky-city design adheres to the simple graph model.\n\nThe proposed design with 32 sky-bridges is found to be non-compliant with this topological constraint, making it impossible to build on a flat plane without bridges crossing.

The design consists of a total of 12 servers. The servers are categorized into two distinct types: 'computation nodes' and 'storage nodes'. For reasons related to the system's architecture, direct network connections are established only between servers of different types; no connections are made between two computation nodes or between two storage nodes. The network is simple, meaning there is at most one direct connection between any pair of servers, and no server is connected to itself. A crucial constraint for the physical installation is that the network cables must be laid out in a planar fashion, meaning no two cables are allowed to cross each other. Given these design constraints, what is the maximum possible number of direct network connections that this cluster can have?", "solution": "Let $G$ be a simple, planar, bipartite graph representing the cluster network.
