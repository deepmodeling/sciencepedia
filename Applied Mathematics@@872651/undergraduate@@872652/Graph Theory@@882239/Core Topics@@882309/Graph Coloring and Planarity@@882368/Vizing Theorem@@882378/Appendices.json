The minimum number of colors required for a valid edge coloring of a graph $G$ is called its edge chromatic number, denoted $\\chi'(G)$.\n\nA fundamental result known as Vizing's theorem states that for any simple graph (a graph without loops or multiple edges between the same two vertices), the edge chromatic number is either $\\Delta(G)$ or $\\Delta(G) + 1$, where $\\Delta(G)$ is the maximum degree of the graph (the highest number of edges connected to any single vertex).

If $\\chi'(G)=\\Delta(G)=k$, then there exists a proper $k$-edge-coloring. In such a coloring, each vertex is incident to exactly $k$ edges and adjacent edges receive distinct colors, so at each vertex the $k$ incident edges must use all $k$ colors exactly once. Therefore, for each color $i$ (with $1 \\leq i \\leq k$), the set of edges of color $i$ meets every vertex exactly once, i.e., it forms a perfect matching (a $1$-factor). Hence a $k$-edge-coloring of a $k$-regular graph decomposes $E(G)$ into $k$ disjoint perfect matchings, which is only possible if $n$ is even.\n\nConsequently, if $n$ is odd and $G$ is $k$-regular, then $G$ cannot be Class 1 (since a perfect matching cannot cover an odd number of vertices), so $\\chi'(G) \\neq k$.

Suppose for contradiction that $G$ admits a proper $3$-edge-coloring, using colors from a set $C$ with $|C|=3$.

For any color $c\\in C$, let $\\ell_c(S)$ be the number of edges of color $c$ with exactly one endpoint in $S$, and let $m_c(S)$ be the number of edges of color $c$ with both endpoints in $S$. Counting the sum of degrees in the color-$c$ subgraph over vertices of $S$ gives\n$$\n|S|=2m_c(S)+\\ell_c(S).\n$$\nSince $|V(H_1)|=5$, taking this congruence modulo $2$ yields\n$$\n\\ell_c(S)\\equiv |S|\\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}.\n$$\nThus for each color $c\\in C$, the cut between $S$ and its complement must contain an odd (hence at least one) edge of color $c$.
