This network of connections is modeled as a pseudograph, where each processing unit is represented by a vertex. A key design constraint is that every vertex must have a degree of exactly 4. The cost of implementing the connections depends on the type of edge. A 'loop' edge, which connects a unit to itself for diagnostic purposes, has an implementation cost of $C_L$. A 'standard' edge, which connects two distinct units, has an implementation cost of $C_S$. If the total cost for all loop edges in the system is $2C_L$, what is the total cost for implementing all the standard edges?
