This provides a necessary condition for isomorphism. Let's use this condition to narrow down the possible values of $n$.\n\nLet $|V(G)|$ denote the number of vertices in a graph $G$, and $|E(G)|$ denote the number of edges.\n\nBy definition, the empty graph $E_n$ has $n$ vertices and 0 edges.\nSo, $|V(E_n)| = n$ and $|E(E_n)| = 0$.\n\nNow, let's consider the complement of the empty graph, $\\bar{E_n}$.\nThe complement $\\bar{E_n}$ has the same vertex set as $E_n$, so $|V(\\bar{E_n})| = n$.\nThe edges in $\\bar{E_n}$ are precisely the pairs of vertices that are *not* connected in $E_n$. Since $E_n$ has no edges, $\\bar{E_n}$ must have an edge between every pair of distinct vertices. A graph where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge is called a complete graph. Therefore, $\\bar{E_n}$ is the complete graph on $n$ vertices, denoted $K_n$.\n\nThe number of edges in a complete graph on $n$ vertices, $K_n$, is the number of ways to choose 2 vertices from the set of $n$ vertices, which is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{2}$.\nSo, $|E(\\bar{E_n})| = |E(K_n)| = \\binom{n}{2} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$.\n\nFor $E_n$ to be isomorphic to $\\bar{E_n}$, they must have the same number of edges. We set their edge counts equal:\n$|E(E_n)| = |E(\\bar{E_n})|$\n$$0 = \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$$\n\nThis equation is true if and only if $n(n-1) = 0$. The solutions for $n$ are $n=0$ and $n=1$.\nThese are the only possible values of $n$ for which the graphs can be isomorphic. For any integer $n \\ge 2$, the number of edges in $\\bar{E_n}$ is positive, while the number of edges in $E_n$ is zero, so they cannot be isomorphic.\n\nWe must now verify if the isomorphism holds for these two specific cases.\nCase 1: $n=0$.\nThe empty graph $E_0$ has 0 vertices and 0 edges. Its complement $\\bar{E_0}$ is also the graph with 0 vertices and 0 edges. Two graphs with 0 vertices are trivially isomorphic. So, $n=0$ is a solution.\n\nCase 2: $n=1$.\nThe empty graph $E_1$ has 1 vertex and 0 edges. Its complement $\\bar{E_1}$ also has 1 vertex. The number of possible edges is $\\binom{1}{2}=0$. So, $\\bar{E_1}$ also has 0 edges. Both $E_1$ and $\\bar{E_1}$ are identical graphs (a single vertex), so they are isomorphic.
