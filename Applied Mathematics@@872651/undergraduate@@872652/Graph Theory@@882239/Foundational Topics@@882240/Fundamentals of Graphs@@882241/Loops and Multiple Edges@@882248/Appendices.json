The \"degree\" of a data center (vertex) is defined as the total number of link endpoints connected to it.

We need to find two quantities from the adjacency matrix $A$: the total number of edges $E$, and the sum of degrees for vertices with odd degree, $D_{odd}$.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of edges, $E$. The total number of edges is the sum of the number of non-loop edges and the number of loops.\nThe number of non-loop edges is given by the sum of the elements in the upper (or lower, since the matrix is symmetric) triangle of the adjacency matrix $A$. Let's denote this by $E_{\\text{non-loop}}$.\n$$ E_{\\text{non-loop}} = \\sum_{i<j} A_{ij} = A_{12} + A_{13} + A_{14} + A_{23} + A_{24} + A_{34} $$\nSubstituting the values from the matrix $A$:\n$$ E_{\\text{non-loop}} = 3 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 12 $$\nThe number of loops, denoted by $L$, is the sum of the diagonal elements of the adjacency matrix.\n$$ L = \\sum_{i=1}^{4} A_{ii} = A_{11} + A_{22} + A_{33} + A_{44} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ L = 2 + 0 + 1 + 3 = 6 $$\nThe total number of edges $E$ is the sum of the non-loop edges and the loops:\n$$ E = E_{\\text{non-loop}} + L = 12 + 6 = 18 $$\n\nNext, we need to find the degree of each vertex. The degree of a vertex $v_i$, $\\deg(v_i)$, is the sum of the non-diagonal elements in its corresponding row (or column) plus twice its diagonal element, as each loop contributes 2 to the degree. The formula is $\\deg(v_i) = \\left(\\sum_{j \\neq i} A_{ij}\\right) + 2A_{ii}$. Let's calculate the degree for each vertex in $V = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4\\}$:\nFor $v_1$:\n$$ \\deg(v_1) = (A_{12} + A_{13} + A_{14}) + 2A_{11} = (3 + 0 + 1) + 2(2) = 4 + 4 = 8 $$\nFor $v_2$:\n$$ \\deg(v_2) = (A_{21} + A_{23} + A_{24}) + 2A_{22} = (3 + 2 + 2) + 2(0) = 7 + 0 = 7 $$\nFor $v_3$:\n$$ \\deg(v_3) = (A_{31} + A_{32} + A_{34}) + 2A_{33} = (0 + 2 + 4) + 2(1) = 6 + 2 = 8 $$\nFor $v_4$:\n$$ \\deg(v_4) = (A_{41} + A_{42} + A_{43}) + 2A_{44} = (1 + 2 + 4) + 2(3) = 7 + 6 = 13 $$\n\nThe degrees of the vertices are $\\{8, 7, 8, 13\\}$.

Let's verify this for our graph:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{4} \\deg(v_i) = 8 + 7 + 8 + 13 = 36 $$\nAnd we calculated $2E = 2(18) = 36$. The lemma holds, which gives us confidence in our calculations. Furthermore, if we let $D_{even}$ be the sum of the even degrees, the Handshaking Lemma implies $D_{even} + D_{odd} = 2E$. The expression we are asked to calculate is $2E - D_{odd}$, which is equivalent to $D_{even}$. The vertices with even degrees are $v_1$ and $v_3$, with degrees 8 and 8 respectively.
