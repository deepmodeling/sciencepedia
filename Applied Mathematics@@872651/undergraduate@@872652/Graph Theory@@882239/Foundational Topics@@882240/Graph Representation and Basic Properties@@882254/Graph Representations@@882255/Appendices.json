This topology is modeled as a simple, undirected graph called a path graph, $P_n$. In this graph, vertices represent the nodes and edges represent communication links. The connections are defined as follows: for any integer $i$ from $1$ to $n-1$, there is an edge connecting vertex $v_i$ and vertex $v_{i+1}$. There are no other edges. The network's structure is stored using an adjacency list representation, where for each vertex, a list of its directly connected neighbors is maintained. The length of the adjacency list for a vertex $v_i$, denoted as $L_i$, is the number of neighbors it has.\n\nFor a network with $n \\ge 2$ nodes, determine a closed-form expression for the quantity $Q = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} L_i^2$.

Swarm A consists of $N_A$ drones, and Swarm B consists of $N_B$ drones. Within each swarm, the communication network is fully connected, meaning every drone has a direct, two-way communication link with every other drone in the same swarm.\n\nThe communication network for the entire system of $N_A + N_B$ drones is represented by an adjacency matrix. This is a square matrix where the entry in row $i$ and column $j$ is $1$ if drone $i$ and drone $j$ have a direct communication link, and $0$ otherwise. By convention, a drone does not have a link with itself, so all diagonal entries of the matrix are $0$.\n\nInitially, the two swarms are isolated, so no drone in Swarm A can communicate with any drone in Swarm B. Now, the swarms are merged into a single, larger swarm. During this process, new communication links are established so that every drone from the original Swarm A is now directly connected to every drone from the original Swarm B. The existing links within Swarm A and Swarm B are maintained.\n\nDetermine a symbolic expression for the total increase in the number of '1's in the system's adjacency matrix as a result of establishing these new links between the two swarms.
