This exercise highlights a critical detail about the constructive Havel-Hakimi algorithm: its deterministic nature produces just one specific graph, which may not share all properties, such as connectivity, with other possible realizations.

The Havel-Hakimi algorithm is a recursive procedure not only for determining if a sequence is graphic, but also for constructing a graph with that sequence if one exists. The constructive version of the algorithm works by repeatedly connecting the vertex with the current highest degree to a set of other vertices with the highest available degrees.\n\nLet's define the \"standard constructive Havel-Hakimi algorithm\" as follows:\n1. Start with a set of $n$ vertices, with initial degrees given by the sequence $D = (d_1, d_2, ..., d_n)$.\n2. If all degrees are zero, the construction is complete.\n3. Select a vertex $v$ with the current maximum degree. If there is a tie, select the vertex with the smallest index.\n4. Let the degree of $v$ be $k$.
