By exploring whether one can be a proper subset of the other, you will uncover a fundamental logical constraint that applies to all simple graphs, reinforcing your understanding of these core concepts.", "problem": "In graph theory, a graph is called **simple** if it has no loops (edges connecting a vertex to itself) and no more than one edge between any two distinct vertices. For a vertex $x$ in a simple graph, its **open neighborhood**, denoted by $N(x)$, is the set of all vertices adjacent to $x$.

Your task is to trace these local connections to determine the graph's overall connectivity, revealing a non-obvious global pattern of disjoint components.", "problem": "Consider a simple graph $G$ with the vertex set $V = \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 19\\}$. The adjacency in this graph is defined by a specific rule: for any vertex $u \\in V$, the set of vertices adjacent to it is precisely $\\{(u+4) \\pmod{20}, (u-4) \\pmod{20}\\}$. This construction ensures that every vertex in the graph has a degree of exactly two. Determine the number of connected components in the graph $G$.", "solution": "Let the graph be $G=(V, E)$ with $V = \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 19\\}$. The rule for adjacency is that a vertex $u$ is connected to two vertices, which we can call its neighbors: $v_1 = (u+4) \\pmod{20}$ and $v_2 = (u-4) \\pmod{20}$. We want to find the number of connected components of $G$.\n\nA connected component is a subgraph in which any two vertices are connected to each other by paths, and which is connected to no additional vertices in the supergraph. We can find the connected components by starting with an arbitrary vertex and finding all vertices that are reachable from it. This set of vertices forms one connected component. We then repeat this process for any vertex not yet assigned to a component, until all vertices are accounted for.\n\nLet's start with vertex 0. The vertices connected to 0 are those that can be reached by repeatedly adding or subtracting 4 (modulo 20). Any vertex reachable from 0 must be of the form $(0 + m \\cdot 4) \\pmod{20}$ for some integer $m$. Let's list these vertices:\n- $m=0: 0 \\cdot 4 \\pmod{20} = 0$\n- $m=1: 1 \\cdot 4 \\pmod{20} = 4$\n- $m=2: 2 \\cdot 4 \\pmod{20} = 8$\n- $m=3: 3 \\cdot 4 \\pmod{20} = 12$\n- $m=4: 4 \\cdot 4 \\pmod{20} = 16$\n- $m=5: 5 \\cdot 4 \\pmod{20} = 20 \\pmod{20} = 0$, which brings us back to the start.\nSo, the first connected component, $C_1$, consists of the vertices $\\{0, 4, 8, 12, 16\\}$. These five vertices form a cycle.\n\nNow, we choose a vertex that is not in $C_1$. Let's pick vertex 1. The vertices reachable from 1 are of the form $(1 + m \\cdot 4) \\pmod{20}$. Let's list them:\n- $1+0 \\cdot 4 \\pmod{20} = 1$\n- $1+1 \\cdot 4 \\pmod{20} = 5$\n- $1+2 \\cdot 4 \\pmod{20} = 9$\n- $1+3 \\cdot 4 \\pmod{20} = 13$\n- $1+4 \\cdot 4 \\pmod{20} = 17$\n- $1+5 \\cdot 4 \\pmod{20} = 21 \\pmod{20} = 1$, which brings us back to the start.\nThe second connected component, $C_2$, is the set of vertices $\\{1, 5, 9, 13, 17\\}$.\n\nNext, we choose a vertex not in $C_1$ or $C_2$. Let's pick vertex 2. The vertices reachable from 2 are of the form $(2 + m \\cdot 4) \\pmod{20}$. Let's list them:\n- $2+0 \\cdot 4 \\pmod{20} = 2$\n- $2+1 \\cdot 4 \\pmod{20} = 6$\n- $2+2 \\cdot 4 \\pmod{20} = 10$\n- $2+3 \\cdot 4 \\pmod{20} = 14$\n- $2+4 \\cdot 4 \\pmod{20} = 18$\n- $2+5 \\cdot 4 \\pmod{20} = 22 \\pmod{20} = 2$.\nThe third connected component, $C_3$, is the set of vertices $\\{2, 6, 10, 14, 18\\}$.\n\nFinally, we pick a vertex not yet accounted for, such as vertex 3. The vertices reachable from 3 are of the form $(3 + m \\cdot 4) \\pmod{20}$. Let's list them:\n- $3+0 \\cdot 4 \\pmod{20} = 3$\n- $3+1 \\cdot 4 \\pmod{20} = 7$\n- $3+2 \\cdot 4 \\pmod{20} = 11$\n- $3+3 \\cdot 4 \\pmod{20} = 15$\n- $3+4 \\cdot 4 \\pmod{20} = 19$\n- $3+5 \\cdot 4 \\pmod{20} = 23 \\pmod{20} = 3$.\nThe fourth connected component, $C_4$, is the set of vertices $\\{3, 7, 11, 15, 19\\}$.\n\nAt this point, we have assigned every vertex from $V = \\{0, 1, \\ldots, 19\\}$ to one of the four components:\n$C_1 = \\{0, 4, 8, 12, 16\\}$\n$C_2 = \\{1, 5, 9, 13, 17\\}$\n$C_3 = \\{2, 6, 10, 14, 18\\}$\n$C_4 = \\{3, 7, 11, 15, 19\\}$\nSince every vertex belongs to exactly one of these sets, we have found all the connected components of the graph. There are 4 distinct connected components.\n\nMore generally, for a graph on $N$ vertices $\\{0, 1, \\ldots, N-1\\}$ where neighbors of $u$ are $(u \\pm k) \\pmod N$, the number of connected components is given by the greatest common divisor of $N$ and $k$, i.e., $\\gcd(N, k)$.\nIn our case, $N=20$ and $k=4$. The number of components is $\\gcd(20, 4)$.\nTo calculate the gcd, we can use the Euclidean algorithm or prime factorization.\n$20 = 2^2 \\cdot 5$\n$4 = 2^2$\nThe greatest common divisor is $2^2 = 4$. This confirms our result obtained by explicitly finding the components.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "1545071"}]}
