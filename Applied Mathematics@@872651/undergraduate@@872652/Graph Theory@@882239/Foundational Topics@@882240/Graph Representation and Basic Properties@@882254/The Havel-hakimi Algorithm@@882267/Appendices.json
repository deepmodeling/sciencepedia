A degree sequence is called 'graphic' if a simple network (no self-loops or multiple links between the same two nodes) can be constructed that realizes this sequence.\n\nA fundamental theorem by Havel and Hakimi provides an algorithm to test if a sequence is graphic. For a sequence $S = (d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_n)$ of non-negative integers, the algorithm is as follows:\n1.  First, verify that the sum of all degrees, $\\sum_{i=1}^n d_i$, is an even number.

If this reduction step results in any negative degrees, the original sequence is not graphic.\n6.
