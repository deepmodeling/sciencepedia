The flow of information between these agents can be modeled as a directed graph where the agents are the vertices and a directed edge from agent $u$ to agent $v$ signifies that agent $u$ sends data directly to agent $v$. To prevent feedback loops and redundant data channels, the proposed architecture must adhere to two rules: an agent cannot send data to itself, and there can be at most one directed data channel from any agent $u$ to any other agent $v$.\n\nA system architect proposes a design specification. In this specification, the sequence of the number of incoming data channels for the five agents (their in-degrees) is $(3, 2, 1, 1, 1)$. The sequence of the number of outgoing data channels for the five agents (their out-degrees) is $(2, 2, 1, 1, 1)$. Note that the sequences represent the set of degrees, not the degrees of specific agents in any particular order.\n\nIs it possible to construct a communication network that satisfies this design specification?\n\nA. Yes, such a network is possible.\n\nB. No, because the sum of the in-degrees is not equal to the sum of the out-degrees.\n\nC. No, because the maximum proposed in-degree (3) is too large for a network of five agents.\n\nD.

An important concept in the analysis of digraphs is the degree of a vertex. The **in-degree** of a vertex is the number of incoming edges (edges pointing towards it), and the **out-degree** is the number of outgoing edges (edges pointing away from it).\n\nConsider a special type of digraph called a **complete symmetric digraph**, denoted as $K_n^*$, built on a set of $n$ vertices, where $n \\geq 2$.

The vertex with out-degree 3 must also have an in-degree of 3.", "solution": "To determine which statement is necessarily true for any simple digraph with the given degree sequences, we will analyze each option based on fundamental principles of graph theory. The set of vertices is $V=\\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4\\}$. The set of out-degrees is $D^+ = \\{d^+(v) \\mid v \\in V\\} = \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$, and the set of in-degrees is $D^- = \\{d^-(v) \\mid v \\in V\\} = \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$.\n\nFirst, let's determine the total number of edges, $|E|$, in such a graph. The degree-sum formula for directed graphs (also known as the handshaking lemma for digraphs) states that the sum of the in-degrees equals the sum of the out-degrees, and this sum is equal to the number of edges.\n$$ \\sum_{v \\in V} d^+(v) = \\sum_{v \\in V} d^-(v) = |E| $$\nUsing the given sets of degrees, we can calculate this sum:\n$$ |E| = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 $$\nSo, any such graph must have exactly 6 edges.\n\nNow we can evaluate each of the given options.\n\n**Option A: The graph has exactly 7 edges.**\nAs calculated above, the number of edges must be 6. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n**Option D: The graph must have exactly one vertex with an in-degree of 0 and exactly one vertex with an out-degree of 0.**\nThe set of out-degrees is given as $\\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$. This means that the four vertices have out-degrees of 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. By definition, there is exactly one vertex whose out-degree is 0. A vertex with an out-degree of 0 is called a sink.\nSimilarly, the set of in-degrees is given as $\\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$. This means there is exactly one vertex whose in-degree is 0. A vertex with an in-degree of 0 is called a source.\nTherefore, the graph must have exactly one source and exactly one sink. This statement is necessarily true.\n\n**Option B: The graph must be strongly connected.**\nA digraph is strongly connected if for every ordered pair of distinct vertices $(u, v)$, there is a directed path from $u$ to $v$. As established in our analysis of option D, the graph must have a source vertex $s$ (with $d^-(s) = 0$) and a sink vertex $t$ (with $d^+(t) = 0$). By definition, there can be no path from any other vertex in the graph to the source $s$. Likewise, there can be no path from the sink $t$ to any other vertex in the graph. The existence of a source or a sink in a graph with more than one vertex immediately implies that the graph is not strongly connected. Thus, this statement is false.\n\n**Option C: The graph must contain a directed cycle of length 3.**\nTo check if this is *necessarily* true, we only need to find one possible construction of such a graph that does not contain a cycle of length 3 (or any cycle at all). Let's try to construct a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).\nLet the vertices be $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4\\}$. Let's assign degrees as follows:\n$d^+(v_1)=3, d^+(v_2)=2, d^+(v_3)=1, d^+(v_4)=0$.\n$d^-(v_1)=0, d^-(v_2)=1, d^-(v_3)=2, d^-(v_4)=3$.\nThis assignment satisfies the degree set requirements. Now we construct the edge set $E$:\n- From $v_1$ (out-degree 3): Add edges $(v_1, v_2)$, $(v_1, v_3)$, $(v_1, v_4)$.\n- From $v_2$ (out-degree 2): Add edges $(v_2, v_3)$, $(v_2, v_4)$.\n- From $v_3$ (out-degree 1): Add edge $(v_3, v_4)$.\n- From $v_4$ (out-degree 0): No edges.\nLet's check the in-degrees of this construction:\n$d^-(v_1)=0$ (no incoming edges).\n$d^-(v_2)=1$ (from $v_1$).\n$d^-(v_3)=2$ (from $v_1, v_2$).\n$d^-(v_4)=3$ (from $v_1, v_2, v_3$).\nThe in-degree sequence is $(0, 1, 2, 3)$, which matches our assignment. The out-degree sequence is also correct by construction. The graph is simple.\nIn this graph, all edges go from a vertex $v_i$ to a vertex $v_j$ where $i  j$. Such a graph is necessarily acyclic. Since we have found a valid graph with the given properties that contains no cycles, it is not necessary for the graph to contain a cycle. Therefore, this statement is false.\n\n**Option E: The vertex with out-degree 3 must also have an in-degree of 3.**\nIn the counterexample for option C, we constructed a valid graph where vertex $v_1$ has out-degree 3, but its in-degree is 0, not 3. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true. It describes one possible assignment of degrees to vertices, but not the only one.\n\nBased on the analysis of all options, only statement D is necessarily true for any graph satisfying the given conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1513078"}]}
