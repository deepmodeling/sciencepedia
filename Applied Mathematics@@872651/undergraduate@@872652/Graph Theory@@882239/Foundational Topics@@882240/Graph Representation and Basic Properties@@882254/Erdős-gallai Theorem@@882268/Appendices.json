A network architect is designing a small-scale, fault-tolerant network topology. The proposed network has 6 nodes, and for specific design reasons, the degrees of these nodes are intended to follow the sequence $D = (5, 4, x, 3, 2, 1)$, where $x$ is an integer parameter that can be adjusted. To ensure the network is physically realizable as a simple graph, the sequence $D$ must be graphic. Determine the unique integer value of $x$ that makes the sequence $D$ graphic.", "solution": "Let the given sequence be $D = (5, 4, x, 3, 2, 1)$. For this sequence to be graphic, it must satisfy several conditions. The number of vertices is $n=6$.\n\nFirst, a fundamental property of any simple graph is that the sum of the degrees of its vertices must be an even number, as each edge contributes to the degree of exactly two vertices.\nThe sum of the degrees in our sequence is $\\sum_{i=1}^{6} d_i = 5 + 4 + x + 3 + 2 + 1 = 15 + x$.\nFor this sum to be even, $15+x$ must be even. Since 15 is odd, $x$ must also be an odd integer.\n\nSecond, in a simple graph with $n$ vertices, the degree of any vertex cannot exceed $n-1$, because a vertex can be connected to at most every other vertex. Also, degrees must be non-negative.\nIn our case, $n=6$, so the maximum possible degree is $6-1=5$. Therefore, we must have $0 \\le x \\le 5$.\n\nCombining these two conditions, $x$ must be an odd integer such that $0 \\le x \\le 5$. The possible values for $x$ are therefore $1, 3, 5$.\n\nTo determine which of these values makes the sequence graphic, we must use a stronger condition, such as the Erdős-Gallai theorem. The theorem states that a sequence of non-negative integers $d_1 \\ge d_2 \\ge \\dots \\ge d_n$ is graphic if and only if $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} d_i$ is even and for every integer $k$ with $1 \\le k \\le n$, the following inequality holds:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^k d_i \\le k(k-1) + \\sum_{i=k+1}^n \\min(k, d_i) $$\nWe must test each possible value of $x$ by first sorting the sequence in non-increasing order and then applying the theorem.\n\nCase 1: $x = 1$\nThe sequence of degrees is $(5, 4, 1, 3, 2, 1)$.
