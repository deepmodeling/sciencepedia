For this problem, we define the Petersen graph, denoted as $P$, using a set-theoretic construction.

Since $v$ is adjacent in $P$ to exactly the three disjoint $2$-subsets, $v$ contributes $3$ edges in $H$. It remains to check edges among the three neighbors.

If $G$ has $4$ vertices and contains an induced $C_4$, then the induced subgraph on all $4$ vertices is $C_4$. Since there is only one $4$-vertex subset, it cannot simultaneously be an induced $P_4$ because $C_4 \\not\\cong P_4$.
