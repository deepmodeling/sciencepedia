Communication between outposts is only possible if a direct link exists. The complete network topology is described by the following adjacency list, where each outpost is listed with the other outposts it can directly communicate with. An analyst needs to determine the scope of a broadcast message sent from one of the outposts. The graph is undirected, so if outpost X is linked to Y, then Y is also linked to X.\n\nThe adjacency list is as follows:\n- A: E\n- B:\n- C: G\n- D:\n- E: A, I\n- F:\n- G: C, K\n- H:\n- I: E, O\n- J:\n- K: G, X\n- L:\n- M:\n- N:\n- O: I, U\n- P:\n- Q: X, W\n- R:\n- S: T\n- T: S, Z\n- U: O, Y\n- V:\n- W: Q\n- X: K, Q\n- Y: U\n- Z: T\n\nDetermine the total number of outposts that belong to the same communication sub-network as outpost 'C'.

In this problem, you are given only the degree sequence of the vertices and a crucial local constraint. By combining the handshaking lemma with logical deduction, you can uncover a global property of the network: the exact number of its connected components. This exercise [@problem_id:1359181] demonstrates how local information can constrain and reveal the large-scale structure of a graph.", "problem": "In a research project on network stability, a theoretical network is modeled as a simple graph with 8 nodes. An analysis of the network's topology reveals that the degrees of the nodes are given by the sequence (2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1). A key structural property of this network is that no two nodes with a degree of 1 are directly connected to each other. Based on this information, determine the number of connected components in the network graph.", "solution": "Let $G$ be a simple graph on $8$ vertices with degree sequence $(2,2,2,2,1,1,1,1)$. The sum of degrees is $12$, so the total number of edges is\n$$\n|E(G)|=\\frac{12}{2}=6.\n$$\nPartition the vertices into $A=\\{ \\text{degree-}2\\ \\text{vertices} \\}$ and $B=\\{ \\text{degree-}1\\ \\text{vertices} \\}$, so $|A|=4$ and $|B|=4$. The condition that no two degree-$1$ vertices are adjacent implies every vertex in $B$ is adjacent to exactly one vertex in $A$, and there are no edges inside $B$. Hence there are exactly $4$ edges between $A$ and $B$ (one per vertex in $B$).\n\nLet $H$ be the subgraph induced by $A$. The number of edges inside $A$ is therefore\n$$\n|E(H)|=|E(G)|- \\text{(edges between $A$ and $B$)}=6-4=2.\n$$\nThus $H$ has $4$ vertices and $2$ edges. Since a cycle requires at least $3$ edges, $H$ is acyclic, i.e., a forest. For any forest, the number of connected components equals $v-e$, so\n$$\nc(H)=4-2=2.\n$$\nAttaching pendant (degree-$1$) vertices to vertices of $H$ does not merge components, so the number of connected components of $G$ equals that of $H$.

This final practice moves into the realm of extremal graph theory, asking a fundamental question for any network architect: for a given number of nodes ($n$) and desired sub-networks ($k$), what are the fewest and most links we can have?

Your answer should be presented as a row matrix containing the expressions for $E_{min}$ and $E_{max}$, in that order.", "solution": "We consider a simple graph on $n$ labeled vertices. Initially there are no edges, so there are $n$ connected components. Each time we add an edge, the number of connected components can decrease by at most $1$: if the edge connects two vertices already in the same component, the number of components does not change; if it connects vertices in two different components, the number of components decreases by exactly $1$.\n\nTo achieve exactly $k$ connected components starting from $n$ components, we must reduce the number of components by $n-k$. Therefore, at least $n-k$ edges are required, and hence\n$$\nE_{\\min}\\geq n-k.\n$$\nThis bound is achievable by constructing a forest with exactly $k$ tree components. If the sizes of the $k$ components are $n_{1},\\dots,n_{k}$ with $\\sum_{i=1}^{k}n_{i}=n$, then taking each component to be a tree uses $(n_{i}-1)$ edges in component $i$, for a total of\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{k}(n_{i}-1)=\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{k}n_{i}\\right)-k=n-k.\n$$\nThus\n$$\nE_{\\min}=n-k.\n$$\n\nFor the maximum number of edges with exactly $k$ connected components, let the component sizes be $n_{1},\\dots,n_{k}$ with $\\sum_{i=1}^{k}n_{i}=n$ and $n_{i}\\geq 1$.

Since the function $x\\mapsto \\binom{x}{2}$ is convex for $x\\geq 0$, the sum is maximized by making one component as large as possible and the others as small as possible.
