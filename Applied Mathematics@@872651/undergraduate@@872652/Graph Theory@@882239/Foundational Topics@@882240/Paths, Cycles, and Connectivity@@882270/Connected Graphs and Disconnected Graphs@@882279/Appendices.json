A simple graph is an undirected graph containing no loops (edges from a vertex to itself) and no more than one edge between any two distinct vertices.\n\nThe network is considered *fragmented* if the corresponding graph is disconnected. A graph is disconnected if there is at least one pair of individuals who cannot be connected through any chain of mutual friends (i.e., there is no path between their corresponding vertices).\n\nA small test group consists of 6 individuals. A network administrator wants to determine the maximum number of friendships that can form among these 6 individuals while ensuring the group remains fragmented. What is this maximum number of friendships?", "solution": "Let $n=6$. A disconnected simple graph on $n$ vertices has at least two connected components. Let the component sizes be $k_{1},\\dots,k_{r}$ with $r\\geq 2$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^{r} k_{i}=n$. For fixed component sizes, the number of edges is maximized when each component is a complete graph, giving\n$$\nE=\\sum_{i=1}^{r} \\binom{k_{i}}{2}.\n$$\nTo maximize $E$ over all partitions of $n$ into $r$ positive integers, consider two component sizes $s\\geq t\\geq 1$ and replace them by $s+1$ and $t-1$. The change in $E$ is\n$$\n\\left[\\binom{s+1}{2}+\\binom{t-1}{2}\\right]-\\left[\\binom{s}{2}+\\binom{t}{2}\\right]\n= s-(t-1)=s-t+1 \\geq 1.\n$$\nThus $E$ increases by moving a vertex from a smaller to a larger component, so for fixed $r$ the maximum occurs when the sizes are $n-(r-1),1,\\dots,1$, yielding\n$$\nE_{\\max}(r)=\\binom{n-(r-1)}{2}.\n$$\nSince $\\binom{m}{2}$ is increasing in $m$ for $m\\geq 2$, $E_{\\max}(r)$ is maximized by the smallest possible $r$, namely $r=2$. Therefore the overall maximum for disconnected graphs is\n$$\nE_{\\max}=\\binom{n-1}{2}.\n$$\nSubstituting $n=6$ gives\n$$\nE_{\\max}=\\binom{5}{2}=10.\n$$\nThis is achieved by a $K_{5}$ plus one isolated vertex; any additional edge would connect the isolated vertex and make the graph connected.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10}$$", "id": "1491869"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply asking if a graph is connected, we can analyze its structural integrity and resilience.

After removing $e$, the hub $C$ and the rim vertex $r$ are still connected because $r$ has a rim neighbor $r'$ in $R$ (since $n \\ge 4$, each rim vertex has two distinct rim neighbors), and the path $C - r' - r$ exists using the spoke $\\{C,r'\\}$ and the rim edge $\\{r',r\\}$. Hence removal of any spoke does not disconnect the graph, so no spoke is a bridge.\n2) Consider a rim edge $e=\\{r_{i},r_{i+1}\\}$ in $E_{R}$. Removing $e$ leaves a path between $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ via the hub: $r_{i} - C - r_{i+1}$, using two spokes. Thus removal of any rim edge does not disconnect the graph, so no rim edge is a bridge.\n\nTherefore, there are no bridges in $W_{n}$.\n\nCut-vertices:\n1) Remove the hub $C$. The remaining graph is exactly the $n$-cycle on $R$, namely $C_{n}$, which is connected.

Hence every pair of vertices in $\\bar{G}$ is connected by a path of length at most $2$, so $\\bar{G}$ is connected. Thus it is impossible for both $G$ and $\\bar{G}$ to be disconnected, and B is true.\n\nFor C, consider $G$ as the disjoint union of $K_{n-1}$ and an isolated vertex for $n \\geq 5$.
