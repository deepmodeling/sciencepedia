The remaining edges of minimum weight are the three edges of weight $20$: $\\{AD,BC,CD\\}$. Any tree including a $30$-edge would have total weight at least $10+20+30=60$, while using two edges of weight $20$ yields total weight $10+20+20=50$, which is strictly smaller; hence every MST uses exactly two edges among $\\{AD,BC,CD\\}$.\n\nWe must count the choices of two edges from $\\{AD,BC,CD\\}$ that, together with $AB$, form a spanning tree (i.e., are acyclic and connect all four vertices).
