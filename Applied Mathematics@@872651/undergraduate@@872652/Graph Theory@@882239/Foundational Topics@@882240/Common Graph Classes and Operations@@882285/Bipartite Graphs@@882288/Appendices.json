By working through this problem, you'll gain insight into how the sizes of the partitions directly determine the density of the graph. Understanding this relationship is crucial for applications in network design where the goal is to maximize connectivity between different groups.

The system identifies a group of 11 users who are candidates for a new \"connection campaign\". To start the campaign, the algorithm must partition these 11 users into exactly two non-empty, disjoint groups: Group A and Group B. The goal of the campaign is to create a connection (a \"recommendation link\") from every user in Group A to every user in Group B. No connections are made between users within the same group. The platform's objective is to maximize the total number of recommendation links created. What is the maximum possible number of recommendation links that can be created in this campaign?", "solution": "Let the sizes of Group A and Group B be $a$ and $b$, respectively, with $a,b \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ and $a+b=11$. A recommendation link is created from every user in Group A to every user in Group B, so the total number of links is\n$$\nL=a b.\n$$\nWe must maximize $L$ subject to $a+b=11$. Express $L$ as a function of $a$:\n$$\nL(a)=a(11-a)=-a^{2}+11a.\n$$\nThis is a concave quadratic in $a$ with vertex at\n$$\na=\\frac{11}{2},\n$$\nso the maximum for integer $a$ occurs at the nearest integers $a=5$ or $a=6$. Substituting either value yields\n$$\nL=5 \\cdot 6=30.\n$$\nTherefore, the maximum number of recommendation links is achieved by partitioning the users into groups of sizes $5$ and $6$, giving $30$ links.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{30}$$", "id": "1484019"}, {"introduction": "A graph is bipartite if and only if it is 2-colorable. This practice problem moves from abstract definitions to a concrete test, challenging you to find a valid partition for the vertices of a hypercube graph. You will discover how a simple property of the vertices—the parity of the number of '1's in their binary labels—provides an elegant way to construct the two sets, proving the graph's bipartite nature. [@problem_id:1484033]", "problem": "Consider a graph $G$ whose set of vertices $V$ consists of all possible 3-bit binary strings (e.g., '000', '010', '111'). An edge exists between any two vertices in $V$ if and only if their corresponding binary strings differ in exactly one position. For example, an edge connects '011' and '111' because they differ only in the first bit, but no edge connects '001' and '111' as they differ in two bits.\n\nWe wish to partition the vertex set $V$ into two non-empty, disjoint sets, $A$ and $B$, such that $A \\cup B = V$ and $A \\cap B = \\emptyset$. This partition must satisfy the property that no two vertices within set $A$ are connected by an edge, and similarly, no two vertices within set $B$ are connected by an edge.\n\nGiven that the vertex '000' must belong to set $A$, determine the sum of the decimal interpretations of all the binary strings that constitute set $A$. For example, the binary string '101' is interpreted as the decimal number $1 \\times 2^2 + 0 \\times 2^1 + 1 \\times 2^0 = 5$. Your final answer should be a single integer.", "solution": "Let $V=\\{0,1\\}^{3}$ and let two vertices be adjacent if their Hamming distance is $1$. This is the 3-dimensional hypercube $Q_{3}$. The requirement that no two vertices within $A$ are adjacent and no two within $B$ are adjacent means that $(A,B)$ is a proper $2$-coloring of $G$, i.e., a bipartition into independent sets.\n\nIn $Q_{3}$, flipping one bit changes the Hamming weight parity. Therefore, if we define the Hamming weight $w(x)$ of a vertex $x=b_{2}b_{1}b_{0}$ by $w(x)=b_{2}+b_{1}+b_{0}$, then every edge connects a vertex of even $w$ to one of odd $w$. Hence the sets\n$$\nS_{\\text{even}}=\\{x\\in V:\\, w(x)\\equiv 0 \\pmod{2}\\},\\qquad S_{\\text{odd}}=\\{x\\in V:\\, w(x)\\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}\\}\n$$\nform a valid bipartition. Moreover, since $Q_{3}$ is connected, any proper $2$-coloring is unique up to swapping the two color classes. With the constraint that $000\\in A$ and noting that $w(000)=0$ is even, it follows that $A=S_{\\text{even}}$.\n\nThus $A$ consists of all $3$-bit strings with even Hamming weight, namely\n$$\nA=\\{000,011,101,110\\}.\n$$\nInterpreting $b_{2}b_{1}b_{0}$ in decimal as $b_{2}2^{2}+b_{1}2^{1}+b_{0}2^{0}$, we compute the values:\n$$\n000\\mapsto 0,\\quad 011\\mapsto 0\\cdot 2^{2}+1\\cdot 2^{1}+1\\cdot 2^{0}=3,\\quad 101\\mapsto 1\\cdot 2^{2}+0\\cdot 2^{1}+1\\cdot 2^{0}=5,\\quad 110\\mapsto 1\\cdot 2^{2}+1\\cdot 2^{1}+0\\cdot 2^{0}=6.\n$$\nTherefore, the required sum is\n$$\n0+3+5+6=14.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{14}$$", "id": "1484033"}, {"introduction": "Can we determine if a graph might be bipartite just by knowing the number of connections each vertex has?
