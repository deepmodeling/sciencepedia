The initial design consists of a set of $n$ servers, where $n \\ge 3$. These servers are arranged in a ring topology, forming what is known in graph theory as a cycle graph $C_n$. In this configuration, each of the $n$ servers is connected by a direct data link to exactly two other distinct servers, forming a closed loop.\n\nTo improve fault tolerance and reduce communication latency, a central hub server is added to the network.
