This first exercise provides a perfect setting to practice this method by translating a real-world scheduling constraint into a graph theory problem. By counting pairs of connections in two different ways, you will derive an upper bound on the number of possible assignments, a core skill in extremal combinatorics. [@problem_id:1548515]", "problem": "A technology startup has 3 senior software developers and 4 distinct software modules that need development. To promote knowledge sharing and prevent skill silos, the project manager wants to assign developers to work on various modules. An assignment is a pairing of one developer with one module. The manager imposes a strict collaboration rule to ensure diverse expertise: no two developers are allowed to be assigned to the exact same pair of modules. For example, if Developer A and Developer B are both assigned to Module 1, they cannot both also be assigned to Module 2. The goal is to maximize the total number of developer-module assignments to accelerate the project. What is the absolute maximum number of unique developer-module assignments possible under this rule?", "solution": "Model the situation as a simple bipartite graph with developer set $D=\\{d_{1},d_{2},d_{3}\\}$ and module set $M=\\{m_{1},m_{2},m_{3},m_{4}\\}$. An assignment is an edge between a developer and a module. Let $t_{j}$ denote the number of developers assigned to module $m_{j}$, so the total number of assignments is\n$$\nE=\\sum_{j=1}^{4} t_{j}.\n$$\nThe collaboration rule says: any two developers cannot be assigned together to two different modules; equivalently, any pair of developers shares at most one module. For a fixed module $m_{j}$, the number of developer pairs who share it is $\\binom{t_{j}}{2}$. Summing over modules counts, for each pair of developers, how many modules they share; thus\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{4} \\binom{t_{j}}{2} \\le \\binom{3}{2}=3,\n$$\nbecause there are $\\binom{3}{2}=3$ developer pairs and each pair can be counted at most once.\n\nSince $t_{j}\\in\\{0,1,2,3\\}$, we have $\\binom{t_{j}}{2}\\in\\{0,0,1,3\\}$. To maximize $E=\\sum t_{j}$ under $\\sum \\binom{t_{j}}{2}\\le 3$, observe:\n- If some module has $t_{j}=3$, it contributes $3$ to the binomial sum, exhausting the entire budget, so all other modules must have $t\\le 1$. This yields at most $E\\le 3+1+1+1=6$.\n- Otherwise, all $t_{j}\\le 2$. Each module with $t_{j}=2$ uses $1$ unit of the binomial budget. With total budget $3$, we can have at most three modules with $t_{j}=2$, and the remaining module can have $t=1$ at no additional binomial cost. This gives\n$$\nE\\le 2+2+2+1=7.\n$$\n\nThe upper bound $E\\le 7$ is attainable. For example, assign:\n- Module $m_{1}$ to developers $d_{1},d_{2}$,\n- Module $m_{2}$ to developers $d_{1},d_{3}$,\n- Module $m_{3}$ to developers $d_{2},d_{3}$,\n- Module $m_{4}$ to developer $d_{1}$ only.\n\nHere $t=(2,2,2,1)$, so $E=7$, and each developer pair shares exactly one module, satisfying the rule.

The processor consists of a rectangular grid of potential qubit locations, arranged in $M$ rows and $N$ columns. We can label each location by its integer coordinates $(i, j)$, where $1 \\le i \\le M$ and $1 \\le j \\le N$.\n\nFor quantum operations, the locations are partitioned into two sets based on their coordinates: a location $(i, j)$ belongs to 'Set A' if the sum $i+j$ is even, and to 'Set B' if $i+j$ is odd. A direct interaction, which forms the basis of a quantum gate, can only occur between adjacent locations, where two locations $(i, j)$ and $(i', j')$ are defined as adjacent if the Manhattan distance between them is 1, i.e., $|i - i'| + |j - j'| = 1$. Note that this adjacency rule means any interaction must be between a location in Set A and one in Set B.\n\nThe team needs to implement a specific multi-qubit operation that requires two distinct \"source\" locations from one set (e.g., Set A) to be simultaneously coupled to a common group of $k$ distinct \"target\" locations from the other set (Set B). In graph theory terms, this operational requirement is equivalent to finding a complete bipartite subgraph, $K_{2,k}$, within the interaction graph of the chip.\n\nFor a prototype chip with a $4 \\times 5$ grid of locations ($M=4, N=5$), what is the maximum integer value of $k$ for which such a $K_{2,k}$ configuration can be physically realized?", "solution": "Model the chip as the grid graph on vertices $(i,j)$ with $1 \\le i \\le M$, $1 \\le j \\le N$, edges between orthogonally adjacent vertices.
