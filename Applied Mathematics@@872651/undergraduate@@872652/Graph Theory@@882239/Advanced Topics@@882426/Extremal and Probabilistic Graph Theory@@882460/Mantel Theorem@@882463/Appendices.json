To encourage open communication and rapid problem-solving, the company wants to establish a network of direct, two-way messaging channels between pairs of developers. This network can be modeled as a simple graph where each developer is a vertex and each messaging channel is an edge.\n\nThe CEO, having read about team dynamics, is concerned about the formation of small, exclusive \"triads\". To prevent this, a policy is implemented: for any group of three distinct developers, it is forbidden for all three possible pairwise messaging channels to exist simultaneously. In other words, if developer A can message B, and B can message C, and C can message A, this arrangement is not allowed.\n\nGiven this restriction, what is the maximum possible number of direct messaging channels that can be established among the 6 developers?", "solution": "Let $G$ be a simple graph on $n$ vertices with $m$ edges and no triangles.

This next practice delves deeper into the structure of this special graph. We will investigate the stability of $T(n, 2)$ by determining the minimum number of triangles created when we add a single edge, thereby violating its triangle-free property. This analysis is crucial for understanding *why* the Turán graph is maximal and how sensitive it is to small perturbations [@problem_id:1519862].", "problem": "In graph theory, a triangle is a complete subgraph on three vertices, often denoted as $K_3$. A graph is called triangle-free if it contains no such subgraphs. For an integer $n \\geq 2$, the Turán graph $T(n, 2)$ is a specific $n$-vertex graph constructed as follows: the set of $n$ vertices is partitioned into two disjoint subsets, $V_1$ and $V_2$, with sizes as close to equal as possible, i.e., $|V_1| = \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$ and $|V_2| = \\lceil n/2 \\rceil$. Two vertices are connected by an edge if and only if they belong to different subsets. The resulting graph $T(n,2)$ is triangle-free.\n\nConsider a new graph $G$ that is formed by adding exactly one edge to $T(n, 2)$. Since $T(n,2)$ is triangle-free, any triangle in $G$ must be a 'new' triangle created by this additional edge. Depending on which two vertices the new edge connects, the number of new triangles might vary.\n\nAssuming $n \\geq 3$, determine the minimum possible number of new triangles created by the addition of this single edge. Express your answer as a single, closed-form expression in terms of $n$.", "solution": "Let $T(n,2)$ be the complete bipartite graph with bipartition $(V_{1},V_{2})$ where $|V_{1}|=\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$ and $|V_{2}|=\\lceil n/2 \\rceil$. By construction, $T(n,2)$ has all edges between $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$ and no edges within either part, so it is triangle-free.\n\nAdding exactly one new edge to obtain $G$ cannot introduce a new cross-edge, because every pair of vertices across the bipartition is already adjacent. Therefore, the new edge must connect two vertices within the same part, say $u,v \\in V_{i}$ for some $i \\in \\{1,2\\}$.\n\nIn any graph, the number of triangles containing a given edge $uv$ equals the number of common neighbors of $u$ and $v$. In $T(n,2)$, if $u,v \\in V_{i}$, then every vertex $w$ in the opposite part $V_{3-i}$ is adjacent to both $u$ and $v$, while no vertex in $V_{i}$ is adjacent to either $u$ or $v$ (other than the new edge between $u$ and $v$). Hence, the number of triangles created by adding the edge $uv$ within $V_{i}$ is exactly\n$$\n|V_{3-i}|.\n$$\n\nThus:\n- If the new edge is added within $V_{1}$, the number of new triangles is $|V_{2}|=\\lceil n/2 \\rceil$.\n- If the new edge is added within $V_{2}$, the number of new triangles is $|V_{1}|=\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$.\n\nTo minimize the number of new triangles, we choose to add the edge within the larger part, so that the opposite part (which counts the triangles) is as small as possible. For $n \\geq 3$, the larger part has size at least $2$, so this choice is feasible.
