We introduce a 2-edge-coloring on this graph using two colors, red and blue. The color of an edge $(u, v)$, where $u,v \\in V$, is determined by the following rule:\n- The edge $(u, v)$ is colored red if the value of $|u-v| \\pmod{5}$ is a quadratic residue modulo 5.\n- The edge $(u, v)$ is colored blue if the value of $|u-v| \\pmod{5}$ is a quadratic non-residue modulo 5.\n\nFor clarity, a non-zero integer $a$ is a quadratic residue modulo a prime $p$ if there exists an integer $x$ such that $x^2 \\equiv a \\pmod{p}$. If no such $x$ exists, $a$ is a quadratic non-residue modulo $p$.\n\nDetermine the total number of monochromatic triangles in this colored graph.

We assume the network is fully interconnected, which corresponds to a complete graph $K_n$. Each connection can be in one of two states: 'active' (which we can color red) or 'latent' (which we can color blue).\n\nA 'vulnerability path' is defined as a sequence of four distinct servers $v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4$ such that the connections $(v_1, v_2)$, $(v_2, v_3)$, and $(v_3, v_4)$ are all in the same state (all active or all latent). In graph theory, this structure is known as a path on four vertices, denoted $P_4$. The existence of such a path could represent a potential chain reaction of failures in the network.\n\nWe are interested in determining the minimum number of servers $n$ required in a fully interconnected network to guarantee that, no matter how the connections are assigned to the 'active' or 'latent' states, at least one such vulnerability path must exist.

Label the vertices $v_{1},v_{2},v_{3},v_{4}$. Color $v_{1}v_{i}$ red for $i \\in \\{2,3,4\\}$ and color all edges among $\\{v_{2},v_{3},v_{4}\\}$ blue. The red subgraph is the star $K_{1,3}$ (which has diameter $2$ and contains no $P_{4}$), and the blue subgraph is $K_{3}$ (which has only three vertices and cannot contain $P_{4}$). Therefore, $K_{4}$ can avoid a monochromatic $P_{4}$, so\n$$\nR(P_{4},P_{4}) \\geq 5.\n$$\n\nUpper bound: Show that every 2-coloring of $K_{5}$ contains a monochromatic $P_{4}$.

Proof: Suppose $d_{R}(a) \\geq 3$ and let the red neighbors be $b,c,d$. \n- If any edge among $\\{b,c,d\\}$ is red, say $bc$ is red, then the third red neighbor, $d$, forms a red path $d-a-b-c$, which is a red $P_{4}$.\n- To avoid this, all three edges among $\\{b,c,d\\}$ must be blue. Let $e$ be the fifth vertex. Among $e$’s three edges to $\\{b,c,d\\}$, at least two share a color. If at least two are blue, say $eb$ and $ec$ are blue, then $e-b-c-d$ is a blue $P_{4}$ (since $bc$ and $cd$ are blue). If at least two are red, say $eb$ and $ec$ are red, then $e-b-a-c$ is a red $P_{4}$. In all cases a monochromatic $P_{4}$ arises.\n\nThus, in any coloring without a monochromatic $P_{4}$, every vertex must satisfy $d_{R}(a) \\leq 2$ and, by symmetry, $d_{B}(a) \\leq 2$, hence $d_{R}(a)=d_{B}(a)=2$ for all vertices $a$. Therefore the red subgraph is $2$-regular on $5$ vertices, so it is a disjoint union of cycles whose total length is $5$, which forces it to be a $5$-cycle $C_{5}$. The blue subgraph, being the complement of a $5$-cycle in $K_{5}$, is also a $5$-cycle. Any $C_{5}$ contains a $P_{4}$ (four consecutive vertices on the cycle), so this contradicts the assumption that there is no monochromatic $P_{4}$. Hence every 2-coloring of $K_{5}$ contains a monochromatic $P_{4}$, and\n$$\nR(P_{4},P_{4}) \\leq 5.\n$$\n\nCombining bounds gives $R(P_{4},P_{4})=5$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5}$$", "id": "1530483"}, {"introduction": "Ramsey's theorem guarantees the existence of monochromatic subgraphs, but a deeper question is: what is the minimum *number* of such subgraphs that must appear?

Each triangle contributes to $S$ as follows:\n- A monochromatic triangle contributes $3$ (at each of its $3$ vertices, the two incident edges are the same color).\n- A bichromatic triangle (two edges of one color, one of the other) contributes $1$ (only at the vertex where the two same-colored edges meet).\n\nLet $T$ be the total number of triangles in $K_{6}$, so $T = \\binom{6}{3} = 20$. If there are $m$ monochromatic and $T - m$ bichromatic triangles, then\n$$\nS = 3m + (T - m) = 2m + T.\n$$\nHence\n$$\nm = \\frac{S - T}{2}.\n$$\nSince $T$ is fixed, minimizing $m$ amounts to minimizing $S$.\n\nFor each vertex, write\n$$\ns(d) \\equiv \\binom{d}{2} + \\binom{5 - d}{2} = \\frac{d(d - 1)}{2} + \\frac{(5 - d)(4 - d)}{2} = d^{2} - 5d + 10.\n$$\nThus\n$$\nS = \\sum_{v} s(d(v)) = \\sum_{v} \\bigl(d(v)^{2} - 5d(v) + 10\\bigr).\n$$\nThe function $s(d) = d^{2} - 5d + 10$ is convex in $d$ and is minimized at $d = \\frac{5}{2}$; among integers $d \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4,5\\}$, the minimum occurs at $d = 2$ or $d = 3$, with\n$$\ns(2) = s(3) = 4,\\quad s(1) = s(4) = 6,\\quad s(0) = s(5) = 10.\n$$\nTherefore, $S$ is minimized when every vertex has red degree $2$ or $3$. Let $x$ be the number of vertices with red degree $3$ and $6 - x$ the number with red degree $2$. Then the sum of red degrees is $3x + 2(6 - x) = 12 + x$, which must be even, so $x$ is even.

The red graph is bipartite, so it has $0$ red triangles; each part induces a blue $K_{3}$, giving exactly $2$ blue triangles.
