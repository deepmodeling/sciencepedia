This problem, framed in the context of protein interactions, challenges you to analyze a network where a specific three-vertex pattern is forbidden. By working through this exercise [@problem_id:1505531], you will uncover a powerful principle showing that in a connected graph, forbidding a path of length two as an induced subgraph forces the graph into its densest possible form, the complete graph.", "problem": "A team of biochemists is mapping the interaction network of a newly discovered set of $n$ distinct proteins, where $n \\ge 3$. The network is modeled as a simple graph where each protein is a vertex and an edge between two vertices signifies a direct interaction between the corresponding proteins. The experimental data has confirmed two key properties of this network. First, the network is connected, meaning it's possible to trace a path of interactions from any protein to any other protein. Second, a specific three-protein structural pattern is entirely absent. This absent pattern consists of three distinct proteins, let's call them A, B, and C, where A interacts with B and B interacts with C, but A and C do not interact with each other.\n\nBased solely on this information, determine the total number of direct interactions in this protein network. Express your answer as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $n$.", "solution": "Let $G$ be a simple connected graph on $n \\ge 3$ vertices with the property that there do not exist distinct vertices $A,B,C$ such that $AB$ and $BC$ are edges while $AC$ is not an edge. Equivalently, for all distinct $a,b,c$, if $ab$ and $bc$ are edges, then $ac$ is also an edge.\n\nClaim: $G$ is complete. To prove this, take any two distinct vertices $u$ and $w$. Since $G$ is connected, there exists a path $u=v_{0},v_{1},\\dots,v_{k}=w$ with $k \\ge 1$. If $k=1$, then $u$ and $w$ are adjacent and we are done. If $k \\ge 2$, apply the given property to the triple $(v_{0},v_{1},v_{2})$ to conclude that $v_{0}v_{2}$ is an edge. Then apply the property to $(v_{0},v_{2},v_{3})$ to get that $v_{0}v_{3}$ is an edge, and continue inductively to obtain that $v_{0}v_{k}$ is an edge. Hence $u$ and $w$ are adjacent. Since $u$ and $w$ were arbitrary, every pair of distinct vertices is adjacent, so $G$ is the complete graph $K_{n}$.\n\nThe number of edges in $K_{n}$ is the number of unordered pairs of vertices, which is\n$$\n\\binom{n}{2}=\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}.\n$$\nThus the total number of direct interactions is $\\binom{n}{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\binom{n}{2}}$$", "id": "1505531"}, {"introduction": "Having seen how forbidding a pattern can dictate a graph's structure, we now shift our focus to a quantitative question: what is the maximum number of edges a graph can have if a certain subgraph is forbidden? This type of question is central to extremal graph theory. This practice [@problem_id:1505525] asks you to consider graphs that are `$2K_2$`-free, meaning they cannot contain two edges that are completely disjoint. You will discover that this simple constraint forces the graph's edges to be organized in a very specific, centralized structure, leading to a sharp upper bound on the number of possible connections.", "problem": "In graph theory, a simple graph is defined by a set of vertices and a set of edges, where each edge connects two distinct vertices. A graph $H$ is a subgraph of a graph $G$ if the vertices and edges of $H$ are subsets of the vertices and edges of $G$, respectively.\n\nLet the graph $2K_2$ be a graph consisting of four distinct vertices, say $v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4$, and exactly two edges, $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$ and $\\{v_3, v_4\\}$. In other words, $2K_2$ is a pair of disjoint edges. A graph is called \"$2K_2$\"-free if it does not contain $2K_2$ as a subgraph.\n\nConsider a simple graph $G$ with 10 vertices. If $G$ is `$2K_2$`-free, what is the maximum possible number of edges that $G$ can have?", "solution": "Let $G$ be a simple graph on $n=10$ vertices that is `$2K_2$`-free. By definition, $G$ is `$2K_2$`-free if and only if no two edges are vertex-disjoint, which is equivalent to the statement that every pair of edges in $G$ intersects.\n\nFirst, consider the case where $G$ contains a triangle with vertices $a,b,c$. Then the edges $\\{a,b\\}, \\{b,c\\}, \\{c,a\\}$ are present. Let $e=\\{x,y\\}$ be any other edge of $G$. Since $G$ is `$2K_2$`-free, $e$ must intersect each of $\\{a,b\\}, \\{b,c\\}, \\{c,a\\}$. If $x \\notin \\{a,b,c\\}$, then to intersect $\\{a,b\\}$ and $\\{b,c\\}$, the vertex $y$ would have to be simultaneously in $\\{a,b\\}$ and in $\\{b,c\\}$, which is impossible. Hence $x \\in \\{a,b,c\\}$. Without loss of generality, take $x=a$. Then $e$ intersects $\\{a,b\\}$ and $\\{a,c\\}$ via $a$, but to also intersect $\\{b,c\\}$, we must have $y \\in \\{b,c\\}$. Thus $e$ is either $\\{a,b\\}$ or $\\{a,c\\}$. By symmetry, any edge intersecting all three triangle edges must be one of the triangle edges. Therefore, if a triangle is present, $G$ has exactly $3$ edges and no more.\n\nNext, consider the case where $G$ is triangle-free. Let $u$ be a vertex of maximum degree, and suppose $\\deg(u) \\geq 2$. Then there exist distinct vertices $v,w$ such that $\\{u,v\\}$ and $\\{u,w\\}$ are edges. Let $e=\\{x,y\\}$ be any edge not incident to $u$. Since $G$ is `$2K_2$`-free, $e$ must intersect both $\\{u,v\\}$ and $\\{u,w\\}$. Because $e$ is not incident to $u$, it must contain $v$ to intersect $\\{u,v\\}$, and it must contain $w$ to intersect $\\{u,w\\}$. Hence $e=\\{v,w\\}$, which would create a triangle on $\\{u,v,w\\}$, contradicting the assumption that $G$ is triangle-free. Therefore, every edge of $G$ must be incident to $u$, so the edges of $G$ form a star centered at $u$, giving\n$$\n|E(G)|=\\deg(u) \\leq n-1.\n$$\nFor $n=10$, this yields $|E(G)| \\leq 9$. This bound is achieved by the star $K_{1,9}$, which is `$2K_2$`-free because all edges share the center vertex.\n\nCombining the two cases, the maximum possible number of edges in a `$2K_2$`-free graph on $10$ vertices is $9$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9}$$", "id": "1505525"}, {"introduction": "We conclude with a problem that touches upon one of the cornerstones of extremal graph theory, Turán's theorem.

This exercise [@problem_id:1505524] demonstrates a crucial insight: often, the restriction imposed by one forbidden subgraph is the dominant factor.
