The network architecture is centralized: one node acts as a 'central hub' and is directly connected to each of the other $n-1$ 'peripheral' nodes. The peripheral nodes are not connected to each other. In this network, the \"normalized influence\" of a node is a measure of its direct connectivity. It is calculated by taking the number of direct connections a node has and dividing this by the maximum possible number of direct connections any single node could have in a network of $n$ nodes, which is $n-1$.\n\nDetermine the ratio of the normalized influence of the central hub to the normalized influence of any single peripheral node.

In a centralized star network, one node (the hub) is directly connected to all other $n-1$ nodes, and each peripheral node is connected only to the hub.\n\nBy definition, the normalized influence of a node is its number of direct connections (degree) divided by the maximum possible number of direct connections any node could have in a network of $n$ nodes, which is $n-1$.\n\n1) For the central hub, the degree is $n-1$.

It explores the fundamental principle that not every set of degrees can form a valid simple graph, introducing the concept of graphical sequences. By reasoning through the constraints of a hypothetical social network, you will learn to identify impossible network configurations and deepen your understanding of graph theory's underlying rules [@problem_id:1495196].", "problem": "In the field of network science, a social network is often modeled as a simple graph, where vertices represent individuals and edges represent a mutual acquaintance. A simple graph is one that has no loops (edges connecting a vertex to itself) and no more than one edge between any pair of vertices. The unnormalized degree centrality of a vertex, or simply its degree, is the number of edges connected to it.\n\nA researcher is analyzing a small, isolated group of 5 individuals. They hypothesize that the degrees of the individuals in this social network are given by the set $\\{4, 4, 3, 2, 1\\}$. However, their colleague claims that it is impossible to construct a simple graph with 5 vertices that has this specific set of degrees.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct logical reason for why such a simple graph cannot exist?\n\nA. The sum of the degrees in the set is 15, an odd number, which is not possible for any graph according to the handshaking lemma.\nB. In a simple graph with 5 vertices, the maximum allowed degree for any vertex is 3, but the set contains degrees of 4.\nC. The existence of two vertices with degree 4 would require every other vertex in the graph to have a degree of at least 2, which contradicts the presence of a vertex with degree 1.\nD. A simple graph cannot have more than one vertex with the maximum degree present in its degree sequence.", "solution": "Let the purported degree sequence be $\\{4,4,3,2,1\\}$ for a simple graph on $n=5$ vertices.\n\nBy the handshaking lemma, the sum of the degrees equals twice the number of edges:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{5} d_{i} = 2|E|.\n$$\nCompute the sum:\n$$\n4+4+3+2+1 = 14 = 2|E|,\n$$\nwhich is even, so there is no contradiction with the handshaking lemma. Therefore, statement A is false.\n\nIn any simple graph on $n$ vertices, the maximum possible degree is $n-1$. Here $n=5$, so the maximum allowed degree is $4$, and degrees of $4$ are permissible. Therefore, statement B is false.\n\nNow suppose there are two vertices, call them $u$ and $v$, each of degree $4$ in a $5$-vertex simple graph. Degree $4$ means each is adjacent to every other vertex. Hence, for any other vertex $w \\neq u,v$, both edges $(u,w)$ and $(v,w)$ must be present. Therefore,\n$$\n\\deg(w) \\ge 2 \\quad \\text{for every } w \\notin \\{u,v\\}.\n$$\nThis implies that no vertex can have degree $1$, contradicting the presence of $1$ in the sequence. This is exactly the logic in statement C, which is therefore correct.\n\nFinally, statement D is false in general: for example, the complete graph $K_{5}$ has five vertices all with the maximum degree $4$.\n\nThus, the correct logical reason is given by statement C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1495196"}, {"introduction": "This final practice addresses a critical and subtle point in network analysis: a degree sequence does not uniquely define a graph's structure.
