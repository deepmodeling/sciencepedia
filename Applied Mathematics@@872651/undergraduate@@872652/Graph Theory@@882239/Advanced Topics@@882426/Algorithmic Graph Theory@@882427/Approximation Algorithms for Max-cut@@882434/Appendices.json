The problem seeks to partition the vertices of a graph $G=(V, E)$ into two disjoint sets, $S_1$ and $S_2$, such that the number of edges connecting a vertex in $S_1$ to a vertex in $S_2$ is maximized.\n\nThe graph under consideration is a path graph $P_n$ with $n$ vertices, labeled $v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n$. The edges in $P_n$ connect consecutive vertices, so the edge set is $E = \\{(v_i, v_{i+1}) \\mid 1 \\le i  n\\}$.\n\nThe algorithm, named `SEQUENTIAL-PARTITION`, processes vertices one by one according to their index, from $i=1$ to $n$.

By the tie rule, $v_{1}$ is placed in $S_{1}$.\n- For $i \\geq 2$, the only possible cut edge incident to $v_{i}$ and connecting to $N_{i-1}$ is $(v_{i},v_{i-1})$. Thus:\n  - If $v_{i-1} \\in S_{1}$, then placing $v_{i}$ in $S_{2}$ yields one cut edge and placing $v_{i}$ in $S_{1}$ yields zero; equivalently $c_{2}=1$ and $c_{1}=0$, so the algorithm places $v_{i} \\in S_{2}$.\n  - If $v_{i-1} \\in S_{2}$, then $c_{1}=1$ and $c_{2}=0$, so the algorithm places $v_{i} \\in S_{1}$.\n\nBy induction on $i$, starting from $v_{1} \\in S_{1}$ and applying the rule that $v_{i}$ is always placed opposite to $v_{i-1}$ for $i \\geq 2$, we obtain the alternating partition\n$$\nv_{i} \\in S_{1} \\iff i \\text{ is odd}, \\quad v_{i} \\in S_{2} \\iff i \\text{ is even}.\n$$\nFor every edge $(v_{i},v_{i+1})$ with $1 \\leq i  n$, the endpoints have opposite parity and therefore lie in opposite sets, so every edge is in the cut.
