For maintenance and fault isolation, the engineers plan to use network separators. A separator is a set of hubs that, when temporarily disabled, partition the remaining hubs into two or more disconnected groups.\n\nThe design must adhere to a principle derived from the Planar Separator Theorem. The theorem states that for any planar graph with $n$ vertices, it is always possible to find a set of separator vertices, $C$, whose removal partitions the remaining vertices into two disjoint sets, $A$, and $B$, such that there are no edges connecting any vertex in $A$ to any vertex in $B$.
