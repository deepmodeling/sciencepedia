Formally, for a graph $G=(V, E)$, a list assignment is a function $L$ that maps each vertex $v \\in V$ to a list of colors $L(v)$. An $L$-coloring is a function $c: V \\to \\bigcup_{v \\in V} L(v)$ such that $c(v) \\in L(v)$ for all $v \\in V$, and $c(u) \\ne c(v)$ for every edge $(u,v) \\in E$. A graph $G$ is called $k$-choosable if it has an $L$-coloring for every list assignment $L$ where $|L(v)| \\ge k$ for all $v \\in V$.\n\nA celebrated result by Carsten Thomassen states that every planar graph is 5-choosable. His inductive proof provides the blueprint for a recursive algorithm to find such a coloring, by proving a stronger statement.\n\nConsider the following algorithmic problem:\nGiven a planar graph $G$ with its outer face being a cycle $C=(v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_k)$, and a list assignment $L$ with the following properties:\n1. Two adjacent vertices on the outer cycle, $v_1$ and $v_2$, are pre-colored with distinct colors. That is, $|L(v_1)|=1$ and $|L(v_2)|=1$, with $L(v_1) \\ne L(v_2)$.\n2. Every other vertex $v$ on the outer cycle $C$ has a list of at least 3 colors, i.e., $|L(v)| \\ge 3$.\n3. Every vertex $u$ inside the cycle $C$ (an internal vertex) has a list of at least 5 colors, i.e., $|L(u)| \\ge 5$.\n\nThe recursive algorithm finds a valid $L$-coloring for $G$. The algorithm's structure depends on a case analysis of the outer cycle $C$. One case is when $C$ has a chord (an edge connecting two non-adjacent vertices of $C$). The other case is when $C$ is an induced cycle (it has no chords).\n\nYour task is to identify the correct procedure for the second case, where $C$ is an induced cycle. Let $v_3$ be the vertex on $C$ adjacent to $v_2$ other than $v_1$. Which of the following options correctly describes the main recursive step to handle this case?\n\nA. Identify two distinct colors, say `a` and `b`, in the list $L(v_3)$ that are not the color assigned to $v_2$. Form a new graph $G' = G - v_3$ and a new list assignment $L'$ where for every internal neighbor $u$ of $v_3$, its list is updated to $L'(u) = L(u) \\setminus \\{a, b\\}$. For all other vertices $w$ in $G'$, $L'(w) = L(w)$. Recursively call the algorithm on the pair $(G', L')$.\n\nB. Remove the vertex $v_3$ to form the graph $G' = G - v_3$. Recursively call the algorithm on $G'$ using the original lists (restricted to the vertices of $G'$). After the recursive call returns a coloring for $G'$, assign a color to $v_3$ from its list $L(v_3)$ that is not used by any of its neighbors.\n\nC. Immediately assign to $v_3$ a color from its list that is not used by $v_2$. Then form the graph $G' = G - v_3$ and recursively call the algorithm on $G'$. For the recursive call, the pre-colored vertices are now $v_1$ and the newly colored $v_3$.\n\nD. Identify the color `c` assigned to $v_2$. Form a new graph $G' = G-v_3$ and a new list assignment $L'$ where for every internal neighbor $u$ of $v_3$, its list is updated to $L'(u) = L(u) \\setminus \\{c\\}$. Recursively call the algorithm on the pair $(G', L')$.\n\nE. Let $v_k$ be the vertex on $C$ adjacent to $v_1$ other than $v_2$. Identify two colors `a` and `b` in $L(v_k)$ not used by $v_1$. Form a new graph $G' = G-v_k$ and a new list assignment $L'$ where the lists of internal neighbors of $v_k$ are updated to $L(u) \\setminus \\{a, b\\}$. Recursively call the algorithm on $(G', L')$.", "solution": "We are given the strengthened inductive hypothesis used in Thomassen’s proof: in a planar graph $G$ whose outer face is a cycle $C=(v_{1},\\dots,v_{k})$, with $v_{1},v_{2}$ precolored with distinct colors, lists of size at least $3$ on the remaining vertices of $C$, and lists of size at least $5$ on internal vertices, there exists an $L$-coloring extending the precoloring.\n\nWe must handle the case that $C$ is an induced cycle (i.e., has no chords). Let $v_{3}$ be the neighbor of $v_{2}$ on $C$ distinct from $v_{1}$. The recursive step must create a smaller instance that still satisfies the inductive hypothesis while ensuring that $v_{3}$ can be colored after the recursive call.\n\nKey facts and constraints:\n- $v_{3}$ lies on $C$ and satisfies $|L(v_{3})|\\ge 3$. Let the color of $v_{2}$ be $c$. Since $L(v_{3})$ has at least $3$ colors, there exist at least two distinct colors $a,b\\in L(v_{3})\\setminus\\{c\\}$.\n- Removing $v_{3}$ forms $G' = G - v_{3}$. Because $C$ is induced, deleting $v_{3}$ exposes the neighbors of $v_{3}$ that were internal in $G$ to the outer face of $G'$. Hence, those neighbors become boundary vertices in $G'$.\n\nTo preserve the inductive hypothesis on $(G',L')$, we need:\n- The two precolored vertices on the outer face of $G'$ to remain adjacent and distinct. These remain $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$, so this is preserved.\n- Boundary vertices (including the newly exposed neighbors of $v_{3}$) must have lists of size at least $3$ in $L'$, and internal vertices at least $5$.\n\nConstruction of $L'$ that enforces this and enables recoloring of $v_{3}$:\n- Choose $a,b\\in L(v_{3})\\setminus\\{c\\}$ with $a\\ne b$.\n- For every internal neighbor $u$ of $v_{3}$ in $G$, set $L'(u)=L(u)\\setminus\\{a,b\\}$. Since $|L(u)|\\ge 5$, we have $|L'(u)|\\ge 3$, which is sufficient because these vertices become boundary vertices in $G'$.\n- For all other vertices $w$, set $L'(w)=L(w)$; in particular $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ remain precolored with distinct colors.\n\nNow apply the inductive hypothesis to $(G',L')$ to obtain an $L'$-coloring of $G'$. In this coloring:\n- No internal neighbor of $v_{3}$ uses $a$ or $b$ by construction.\n- The only possible conflicts for coloring $v_{3}$ with $a$ or $b$ are with its boundary neighbors $v_{2}$ and $v_{4}$ (where $v_{4}$ is the other neighbor of $v_{3}$ on $C$). We ensured $a,b\\ne c$ (the color of $v_{2}$), so $v_{2}$ does not block $a$ or $b$.\n- At $v_{4}$, at most one of $\\{a,b\\}$ can be used; thus at least one of $a$ or $b$ remains available for $v_{3}$, yielding a valid extension to an $L$-coloring of $G$.\n\nThis precisely matches Option A. The other options fail for the following reasons:\n- B: Removing $v_{3}$ without restricting neighbor lists gives no guarantee that any color in $L(v_{3})$ remains unused by all neighbors after the recursive coloring, so $v_{3}$ may become uncolorable.\n- C: Precoloring $v_{3}$ breaks the inductive hypothesis because the two precolored vertices ($v_{1}$ and $v_{3}$) are generally not adjacent, which the hypothesis requires.\n- D: Removing only the color $c$ from neighbors of $v_{3}$ is irrelevant for enabling $v_{3}$ (which cannot use $c$ anyway) and provides no guarantee of a free color for $v_{3}$ later.\n- E: Although symmetric choices can sometimes work, the stated procedure is not aligned with the specified focus on $v_{3}$ and the standard step; furthermore, the problem frames the step specifically in terms of $v_{3}$.\n\nTherefore, the correct main recursive step is Option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1548857"}]}
