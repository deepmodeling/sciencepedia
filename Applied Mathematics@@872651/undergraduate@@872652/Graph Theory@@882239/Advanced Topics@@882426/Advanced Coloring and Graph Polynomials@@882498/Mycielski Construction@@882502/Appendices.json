Let's consider a variation of this construction.\n\nLet $G=(V, E)$ be a graph with vertex set $V=\\{v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n\\}$ and edge set $E$. The modified Mycielski graph, denoted $M_S(G)$, is constructed as follows:\n1. The vertex set of $M_S(G)$ is $V \\cup U \\cup \\{w\\}$, where $U = \\{u_1, u_2, \\dots, u_n\\}$ is a set of new vertices corresponding to the vertices in $V$, and $w$ is an additional single vertex.\n2.

For each vertex $v_i \\in V$, the corresponding vertex $u_i \\in U$ is made adjacent to all vertices in the neighborhood of $v_i$ in $G$.

The vertex $w$ is made adjacent to a specific subset of vertices in $U$. Let $V_S \\subseteq V$ be a predefined subset of vertices in the original graph $G$. The corresponding subset of vertices in $U$ is $S = \\{u_i \\in U \\mid v_i \\in V_S \\}$. The vertex $w$ is made adjacent to every vertex in $S$, and only to those vertices.\n\nNow, consider a specific graph $G$ which is formed by the union of two complete graphs, each on 5 vertices, which share exactly one common vertex. Let these two complete graphs be $A$ and $B$. The shared vertex is $x$. Thus, the vertex set of $A$ is $V(A)=\\{a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, x\\}$ and the vertex set of $B$ is $V(B)=\\{b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4, x\\}$.

A $5$-coloring of $G$ exists: color $A$ with five distinct colors, and color $B$ with the same five colors so that the shared vertex $x$ keeps its color and the other four vertices of $B$ use the four colors different from $c(x)$.

Since $w$ is adjacent to every vertex in $S$, $w$ is adjacent to vertices of all $5$ colors, and hence cannot receive any of these $5$ colors.
