A graph is called $k$-colorable if it has a $k$-coloring. A triangle in a graph is a cycle of length 3. A graph is called triangle-free if it contains no triangles.\n\nGrötzsch's theorem states that every triangle-free planar graph is 3-colorable.\n\nLet $K_4$ be the complete graph on four vertices, where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge. Let the graph $G$ be constructed by removing exactly one edge from $K_4$.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly addresses whether Grötzsch's theorem can be applied to the graph $G$ to conclude that it is 3-colorable?\n\nA. Yes, the theorem applies because the graph $G$ is planar and is also 3-colorable.\n\nB. Yes, the theorem applies because the graph $G$ is triangle-free and planar.\n\nC. No, the theorem does not apply because the graph $G$ is not planar.\n\nD. No, the theorem does not apply because the graph $G$ is not triangle-free.\n\nE. No, the theorem does not apply because the graph $G$ is not 3-colorable.", "solution": "Let $K_{4}$ have vertex set $\\{v_{1},v_{2},v_{3},v_{4}\\}$. Construct $G$ by removing exactly one edge, say the edge $v_{1}v_{2}$.\n\nFirst, verify planarity. The graph $K_{4}$ is planar. A standard graph-theoretic principle is that any subgraph of a planar graph is planar. Since $G$ is obtained from $K_{4}$ by deleting an edge, $G$ is a subgraph of $K_{4}$ and hence is planar.\n\nSecond, check whether $G$ is triangle-free. In $K_{4}$, every 3-vertex subset induces a triangle. Deleting the edge $v_{1}v_{2}$ removes the triangles that use that edge, namely the triangles on $\\{v_{1},v_{2},v_{3}\\}$ and $\\{v_{1},v_{2},v_{4}\\}$. However, the triangles on $\\{v_{1},v_{3},v_{4}\\}$ and $\\{v_{2},v_{3},v_{4}\\}$ remain, because none of their edges were deleted. Therefore, $G$ still contains triangles, so $G$ is not triangle-free.\n\nGrötzsch’s theorem applies only to triangle-free planar graphs. Although $G$ is planar, it is not triangle-free, so the hypothesis of Grötzsch’s theorem is not satisfied, and the theorem cannot be applied to $G$.\n\nFor completeness, $G$ is indeed $3$-colorable: assign the same color to $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ (they are nonadjacent in $G$), and distinct colors to $v_{3}$ and $v_{4}$ since $v_{3}v_{4}$ is an edge. This shows that option E is false for a different reason; the correct reason the theorem does not apply is that $G$ is not triangle-free.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is that the theorem does not apply because $G$ is not triangle-free.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1510199"}, {"introduction": "After examining the triangle-free property, we now turn our attention to the theorem's second key hypothesis: planarity.

To apply it to a given graph, two hypotheses must both hold: the graph must be triangle-free and planar.\n\nThe graph $K_{3,3}$ is bipartite with bipartition $\\{u_{1},u_{2},u_{3}\\}$ and $\\{v_{1},v_{2},v_{3}\\}$, with all edges between the parts and none within a part. Any bipartite graph contains no odd cycle; in particular, it contains no triangle. Therefore, $K_{3,3}$ is triangle-free, so the triangle-free hypothesis is satisfied.\n\nHowever, $K_{3,3}$ is not planar. By Kuratowski's theorem, a graph is planar if and only if it contains no subdivision of $K_{5}$ or $K_{3,3}$; since $K_{3,3}$ itself is a Kuratowski obstruction, it is nonplanar. Hence the planarity hypothesis of Grötzsch's theorem fails for $K_{3,3}$, so the theorem cannot be applied to it. This is the correct reason.\n\nThe other options are incorrect: $K_{3,3}$ does not contain triangles (so A is false), its chromatic number is actually $2$ because it is bipartite (so B is false), Grötzsch's theorem yields an upper bound of $3$ for graphs satisfying its hypotheses (so D is false), and the theorem imposes no condition about having a minimum number of edges (so E is false).

By meticulously following a recursive algorithm, you will not only find a valid coloring but also gain a deeper, procedural understanding of why every triangle-free planar graph is 3-colorable.", "problem": "A proper 3-coloring of a simple graph $G=(V, E)$ is a function $C: V \\to \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ such that for any edge $(u,v) \\in E$, the condition $C(u) \\ne C(v)$ holds. A well-known theorem in graph theory states that any planar graph that is triangle-free (contains no cycles of length three) has a proper 3-coloring.\n\nYou are tasked with finding such a coloring for a specific graph by meticulously applying a deterministic, recursive algorithm derived from a constructive proof of this theorem.\n\nThe graph in question, $G_0$, is defined by the vertex set $V = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\\}$ and the edge set $E = \\{(1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (2,3), (2,6), (3,4), (3,7), (4,8), (5,6), (5,8), (6,7), (7,8)\\}$.\n\nThe algorithm, which we will call `Find3Coloring`, is as follows:\n\n**Algorithm: `Find3Coloring(G)`**\n\n1.  **Base Case:** If the graph $G$ has 3 or fewer vertices, assign a unique color from $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$ to each vertex and return the resulting coloring.

Select the vertex $v$ with the smallest label in $G$.\n    b. Identify the neighbors of $v$, let them be $u_1, u_2, \\ldots, u_k$ sorted in increasing order of their labels. Since the graph is triangle-free and the minimum degree is 3, $v$ must have at least three non-adjacent neighbors. We will operate on the neighbors with the smallest and largest labels, $u_1$ and $u_k$.\n    c. Form a new graph $G'$ by removing $v$ and all its incident edges, and then merging vertices $u_1$ and $u_k$ into a single new vertex. This new vertex inherits the smaller of the two labels (i.e., the label of $u_1$).
