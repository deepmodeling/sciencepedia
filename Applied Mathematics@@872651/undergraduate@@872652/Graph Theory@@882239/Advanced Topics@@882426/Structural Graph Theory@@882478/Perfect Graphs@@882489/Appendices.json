Let $G=(V, E)$ be a simple undirected graph, where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is the set of edges.\n\nA key concept is that of an *induced subgraph*. An induced subgraph $H$ of $G$ is a graph formed from a subset of vertices $V' \\subseteq V$ and *all* edges from $E$ that have both endpoints in $V'$.\n\nTwo important numerical invariants of a graph are its clique number and chromatic number:\n- The *clique number* of a graph $G$, denoted $\\omega(G)$, is the number of vertices in a maximum clique in $G$. A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are connected by an edge.\n- The *chromatic number* of a graph $G$, denoted $\\chi(G)$, is the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of $G$ such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nA graph $G$ is defined as a *perfect graph* if, for every induced subgraph $H$ of $G$ (including $G$ itself), its chromatic number is equal to its clique number; that is, $\\chi(H) = \\omega(H)$.\n\nConsider the path graph on four vertices, denoted $P_4$. This graph has the vertex set $V = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4\\}$ and the edge set $E = \\{(v_1, v_2), (v_2, v_3), (v_3, v_4)\\}$.

We can group these subgraphs by their number of vertices. Due to symmetry in the graph structure, we only need to consider non-isomorphic cases. The edges of the parent graph $P_4$ are $(v_1, v_2)$, $(v_2, v_3)$, and $(v_3, v_4)$.\n\n1.  **Induced subgraphs on 1 vertex:**\n    Any subgraph induced by a single vertex (e.g., the set $\\{v_1\\}$) is an isolated vertex, a graph denoted $K_1$.\n    For this subgraph $H = K_1$, the largest clique consists of the single vertex, so its size is 1. Thus, $\\omega(H) = 1$.\n    A single vertex requires only one color. Thus, $\\chi(H) = 1$.\n    This analysis yields the ordered pair $(\\omega(H), \\chi(H)) = (1, 1)$.\n\n2.  **Induced subgraphs on 2 vertices:**\n    There are two non-isomorphic cases for subgraphs induced by two vertices.\n    -   Case 2a: The two vertices are adjacent in $P_4$. An example is the set $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$. The induced subgraph has the edge $(v_1, v_2)$ and is isomorphic to $K_2$. For this subgraph $H=K_2$, the largest clique contains both vertices, so $\\omega(H) = 2$. Two vertices connected by an edge require two different colors, so $\\chi(H) = 2$. This gives the pair $(2, 2)$.\n    -   Case 2b: The two vertices are not adjacent in $P_4$. An example is the set $\\{v_1, v_3\\}$. The induced subgraph has no edges, consisting of two isolated vertices. For this subgraph $H$, the largest clique is a single vertex, so $\\omega(H) = 1$. Since there are no edges, all vertices can be the same color, so $\\chi(H) = 1$. This gives the pair $(1, 1)$.\n\n3.  **Induced subgraphs on 3 vertices:**\n    There are two non-isomorphic cases for subgraphs induced by three vertices.\n    -   Case 3a: The three vertices form a connected path. An example is $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$. The induced edges are $(v_1, v_2)$ and $(v_2, v_3)$, forming the path graph $P_3$. For this subgraph $H=P_3$, the largest clique is any single edge (e.g., $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$), so $\\omega(H) = 2$. This graph is bipartite and has an edge, so it requires two colors (e.g., color $v_1, v_3$ red and $v_2$ blue). Thus, $\\chi(H) = 2$. This gives the pair $(2, 2)$.\n    -   Case 3b: The three vertices do not form a connected path. An example is $\\{v_1, v_2, v_4\\}$. The only edge from $P_4$ with both endpoints in this set is $(v_1, v_2)$. The induced subgraph consists of an edge and an isolated vertex ($K_2 \\cup K_1$). For this subgraph $H$, the largest clique is the edge $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$, so $\\omega(H) = 2$. Since the graph contains an edge, it needs at least two colors. A 2-coloring is possible (e.g., $v_1$ red, $v_2$ blue, $v_4$ red). Thus, $\\chi(H) = 2$. This gives the pair $(2, 2)$.\n\n4.  **Induced subgraph on 4 vertices:**\n    The only subgraph on 4 vertices is $P_4$ itself, induced by the set $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4\\}$.\n    For this subgraph $H = P_4$, the largest clique is any single edge (e.g., $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$), giving $\\omega(H) = 2$.\n    The graph $P_4$ is bipartite (and not edgeless), meaning it is 2-colorable but not 1-colorable. A valid 2-coloring is to give $\\{v_1, v_3\\}$ one color and $\\{v_2, v_4\\}$ another. Thus, $\\chi(H) = 2$.\n    This gives the pair $(2, 2)$.\n\nBy examining all possible non-empty induced subgraphs, we have found the following $(\\omega, \\chi)$ pairs:\n- From 1-vertex subgraphs: $(1, 1)$\n- From 2-vertex subgraphs: $(2, 2)$ and $(1, 1)$\n- From 3-vertex subgraphs: $(2, 2)$\n- From 4-vertex subgraphs: $(2, 2)$\n\nThe set $S$ of all unique pairs generated is the collection of these distinct pairs. Therefore, $S = \\{(1, 1), (2, 2)\\}$.\nThis result also confirms that $P_4$ is a perfect graph, as for every induced subgraph $H$, we found that $\\omega(H) = \\chi(H)$.\n\nComparing our resulting set $S$ with the given choices, the correct one is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1526462"}, {"introduction": "Understanding perfection in graphs also requires recognizing imperfection.

The core can only execute one job at a time.\n\nA job with a time allocation from a start time $s$ to an end time $e$ is represented by the inclusive interval $[s, e]$. Two jobs with intervals $[s_1, e_1]$ and $[s_2, e_2]$ are considered to have a time conflict if their intervals overlap.

This is a classic optimization problem known as the Maximum Weight Independent Set problem on an interval graph. The jobs can be modeled as vertices in a graph, and an edge exists between two vertices if their corresponding time intervals overlap. The goal is to find an independent set (a set of vertices with no edges between them) with the maximum sum of weights (priority values).\n\nA simple greedy approach, such as picking the job with the highest priority value first, does not guarantee an optimal solution. For example, selecting Job 3 (value 6, interval [2, 7]) would prevent the selection of all other jobs except Job 6, for a total value of $6+2=8$. As we will see, this is not the optimal solution.\n\nThis problem can be solved efficiently using dynamic programming. The standard algorithm requires processing the jobs in an order sorted by their end times. Let's examine the end times of the given jobs: Job 1 ends at 4, Job 2 at 6, Job 3 at 7, Job 4 at 8, Job 5 at 9, and Job 6 at 10. The list is already sorted by end time, so we can proceed with the jobs in their given order. Let the jobs be denoted by $J_i = (s_i, e_i, v_i)$ for $i=1, \\dots, 6$.\n\nLet $V(i)$ be the maximum priority value achievable considering only the first $i$ jobs from this sorted list. We can define a recurrence relation for $V(i)$. To compute $V(i)$, we consider the $i$-th job, Job $i$. We have two choices:\n\n1.  Do not include Job $i$ in our optimal set. In this case, the maximum value is the same as the maximum value for the first $i-1$ jobs, which is $V(i-1)$.\n2.  Include Job $i$ in our optimal set. If we do this, we gain its value, $v_i$. However, we cannot include any other jobs from the set $\\{1, ..., i-1\\}$ that conflict with Job $i$. The jobs that are compatible with Job $i$ are those that finish before Job $i$ starts, i.e., jobs $j$ such that $e_j \\le s_i$. To get the maximum value, we should add $v_i$ to the optimal solution for all jobs compatible with Job $i$. Let $p(i)$ be the index of the latest-finishing job in the sorted list that is compatible with Job $i$ (i.e., $p(i) = \\max(\\{j  i \\mid e_j \\le s_i\\} \\cup \\{0\\})$). The value from this choice is $v_i + V(p(i))$.\n\nCombining these two cases, the recurrence relation is:\n$V(i) = \\max(V(i-1), v_i + V(p(i)))$\nThe base case is $V(0) = 0$.\n\nLet's apply this to our sorted list of jobs $J_1, ..., J_6$.\n\nFirst, we find the values of $p(i)$ for each job $i=1, \\dots, 6$:\n*   $p(1)$ for $J_1$ (s=1): There are no jobs before it. $p(1) = 0$.\n*   $p(2)$ for $J_2$ (s=3): $J_1$ has $e_1=4$. $4 \\not\\le 3$. No compatible jobs. $p(2) = 0$.\n*   $p(3)$ for $J_3$ (s=2): $J_1$ has $e_1=4$ and $J_2$ has $e_2=6$. Both end after $s_3=2$. No compatible jobs. $p(3) = 0$.\n*   $p(4)$ for $J_4$ (s=6): $J_1$ has $e_1=4 \\le 6$. $J_2$ has $e_2=6 \\le 6$. $J_3$ has $e_3=7 \\not\\le 6$. The latest finishing compatible job is $J_2$ (index 2). So, $p(4) = 2$.\n*   $p(5)$ for $J_5$ (s=5): $J_1$ has $e_1=4 \\le 5$. $J_2$ and $J_3$ have end times $>5$. The latest finishing compatible job is $J_1$ (index 1). So, $p(5) = 1$.\n*   $p(6)$ for $J_6$ (s=8): $J_1(e_1=4\\le 8)$, $J_2(e_2=6\\le 8)$, $J_3(e_3=7\\le 8)$, $J_4(e_4=8\\le 8)$. $J_5(e_5=9\\not\\le 8)$.
