The defining feature of a chordal graph is intuitive: any long cycle must have a \"shortcut,\" or a chord. This practice [@problem_id:1534394] frames this structural property in the practical context of network design, where such shortcuts can enhance stability. Your task is to determine the minimum number of connections needed to make a simple ring network chordal, giving you a concrete understanding of the triangulation process.", "problem": "A communication network is being designed with 5 server nodes, which we can label $v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5$. Initially, the planned connections form a simple ring: each server $v_i$ is connected to $v_{i+1}$ for $i=1,..,4$, and server $v_5$ is connected back to $v_1$.\n\nFor network stability, the design must satisfy a \"no long-path feedback\" condition. This condition states that any closed loop (cycle) involving 4 or more distinct servers must have a \"shortcut\". A shortcut is defined as a direct connection (an edge) between two servers in the loop that are not adjacent in that loop.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of additional direct connections that must be added to the initial ring design to satisfy the \"no long-path feedback\" condition for the entire network?", "solution": "Let $G_0$ be the 5-cycle $C_5$ on vertices $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5\\}$ with edges $v_i v_{i+1}$ for $i \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}$ and $v_5v_1$. The required condition is that every cycle of length at least 4 has a chord (a shortcut), i.e., the resulting graph must be chordal.\n\nLower bound (one added edge is insufficient): By symmetry of $C_5$, it suffices to consider adding the single chord $v_1v_3$. In $G_0 \\cup \\{v_1v_3\\}$, consider the cycle $v_1-v_3-v_4-v_5-v_1$ of length 4. The only nonconsecutive pairs on this 4-cycle are $\\{v_1,v_4\\}$ and $\\{v_3,v_5\\}$, and neither $v_1v_4$ nor $v_3v_5$ is an edge of the graph. Hence this 4-cycle has no chord, violating the condition. Therefore at least 2 additional edges are necessary.\n\nUpper bound (two added edges suffice): Add the two chords $v_1v_3$ and $v_1v_4$ to form $G=G_0 \\cup \\{v_1v_3, v_1v_4\\}$. We verify that every cycle of length at least 4 in $G$ has a chord.\n1) The 5-cycle $v_1-v_2-v_3-v_4-v_5-v_1$ has chords $v_1v_3$ and $v_1v_4$.\n2) The 4-cycle $v_1-v_2-v_3-v_4-v_1$ has chord $v_1v_3$.\n3) The 4-cycle $v_1-v_3-v_4-v_5-v_1$ has chord $v_1v_4$.\n4) There are no other 4-cycles: any 4-cycle avoiding $v_1$ would have to use a non-edge such as $v_2v_5$ or $v_2v_4$, which do not exist in $G$; and any other 4-cycle containing $v_1$ is isomorphic to one of the two listed above.\n\nThus $G$ is chordal, so two added edges suffice.
