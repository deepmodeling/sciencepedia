An equivalent and often simpler characterization is based on forbidden induced subgraphs: a graph is a cograph if and only if it does not contain the path graph on four vertices, $P_4$, as an induced subgraph.\n\nA path graph $P_4$ consists of four distinct vertices, say $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4\\}$, and the set of edges $\\{(v_1, v_2), (v_2, v_3), (v_3, v_4)\\}$.

Since any $P_{4}$ has maximum degree $2$, the induced subgraph cannot be a $P_{4}$.\n\nCase 2: The four-vertex set does not contain the center. Then all four vertices are leaves. In the star, no two leaves are adjacent, so the induced subgraph on these four vertices has no edges; it is an independent set on four vertices.

A key property of a cograph is that it does not contain an induced subgraph isomorphic to the path graph on four vertices ($P_4$). A $P_4$ is a simple path with four vertices and three edges. The subgraph induced by a set of vertices $S$ consists of the vertices in $S$ and all edges from the original graph that connect two vertices in $S$.\n\nConsider a system composed of three separate, identical, linear sensor arrays. Each array is modeled as a path graph $P_4$.

Let $G$ be the disjoint union of three copies of $P_{4}$.

Therefore, any edge added with at least one endpoint outside $S_{i}$ does not change whether $G[S_{i}]$ is a $P_{4}$. Hence, to eliminate the induced $P_{4}$ on $S_{i}$, at least one new edge must be added with both endpoints in $S_{i}$. Since the $S_{i}$ are disjoint, at least one such edge is needed for each $i$, giving a lower bound of $3$ added edges.\n\nUpper bound (construction): In each component $H_{i}$ with path $v_{i,1}-v_{i,2}-v_{i,3}-v_{i,4}$, add a single chord, for example the edge $v_{i,1}v_{i,4}$. Then the induced subgraph on $S_{i}$ has at least $4$ edges and thus is not isomorphic to $P_{4}$, which has exactly $3$ edges. Therefore each modified $H_{i}$ is $P_{4}$-free. Since there are no edges between components, the resulting graph is the disjoint union of three $P_{4}$-free graphs, so it is itself $P_{4}$-free and hence a cograph.\n\nCombining the lower bound and the explicit construction, the minimum number of edges that must be added is $3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "1489733"}]}
