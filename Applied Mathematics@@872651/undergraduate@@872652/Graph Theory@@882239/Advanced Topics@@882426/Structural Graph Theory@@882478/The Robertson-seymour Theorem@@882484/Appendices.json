An edge contraction is the operation of removing an edge $(u,v)$ and merging its two incident vertices, $u$ and $v$, into a new single vertex. The new vertex is adjacent to all vertices that were previously adjacent to either $u$ or $v$.\n\nConsider the 3-dimensional cube graph, denoted as $Q_3$. The vertex set of $Q_3$ can be represented by all 3-bit binary strings: $\\{000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111\\}$. An edge exists between two vertices if and only if their binary string representations differ in exactly one bit position. For example, vertex $000$ is connected to vertices $001$, $010$, and $100$.\n\nThe complete graph on four vertices, denoted $K_4$, is a graph with four vertices where every vertex is connected to every other vertex. One method to obtain a $K_4$ minor from $Q_3$ is to find a perfect matching in $Q_3$ and contract all four of its edges. A perfect matching is a set of edges where no two edges share a vertex, and every vertex in the graph is an endpoint of one of the edges.\n\nWhich of the following sets of edges represents a perfect matching in $Q_3$ that, upon contraction of all four edges, results in a graph isomorphic to $K_4$?\n\nA. $\\{(000, 100), (001, 101), (010, 110), (011, 111)\\}$\n\nB. $\\{(000, 001), (001, 011), (110, 100), (101, 111)\\}$\n\nC. $\\{(000, 111), (001, 110), (010, 101), (100, 011)\\}$\n\nD. $\\{(000, 010), (001, 101), (011, 111), (100, 110)\\}$\n\nE. $\\{(000, 001), (110, 111), (100, 110), (011, 001)\\}$", "solution": "We use the definition of $Q_{3}$: vertices are $3$-bit strings, and an edge exists between two vertices if and only if their Hamming distance is $1$. A perfect matching is a set of $4$ edges that are pairwise vertex-disjoint and cover all $8$ vertices. Upon contracting a perfect matching $\\{(u_{i},v_{i})\\}_{i=1}^{4}$, the graph has four supervertices $U_{i}=\\{u_{i},v_{i}\\}$; two supervertices $U_{i}$ and $U_{j}$ are adjacent in the contracted graph if and only if there exists at least one edge in $Q_{3}$ between a vertex in $U_{i}$ and a vertex in $U_{j}$. To obtain a graph isomorphic to $K_{4}$, every pair among the four supervertices must be adjacent.\n\nCheck each option:\n\nOption A: $\\{(000,100),(001,101),(010,110),(011,111)\\}$. This is a perfect matching (all four edges are valid and vertex-disjoint). After contraction, the supervertices are $A_{1}=\\{000,100\\}$, $A_{2}=\\{001,101\\}$, $A_{3}=\\{010,110\\}$, $A_{4}=\\{011,111\\}$. Check adjacency between $A_{1}$ and $A_{4}$: test edges $000$–$011$ (Hamming distance $2$), $000$–$111$ (distance $3$), $100$–$011$ (distance $3$), $100$–$111$ (distance $2$); none is an edge. Hence the contracted graph is not complete; this does not yield $K_{4}$.\n\nOption B: $\\{(000,001),(001,011),(110,100),(101,111)\\}$. This is not a matching because $(000,001)$ and $(001,011)$ share vertex $001$.\n\nOption C: $\\{(000,111),(001,110),(010,101),(100,011)\\}$. The pair $(000,111)$ is not an edge in $Q_{3}$ (Hamming distance $3$), so this is invalid.\n\nOption D: $\\{(000,010),(001,101),(011,111),(100,110)\\}$. Each listed pair differs in exactly one bit, and all $8$ vertices are used exactly once, so this is a perfect matching. After contraction, define $P_{1}=\\{000,010\\}$, $P_{2}=\\{001,101\\}$, $P_{3}=\\{011,111\\}$, $P_{4}=\\{100,110\\}$.

One such operation is the graph minor. A graph $H$ is a **minor** of a graph $G$ if $H$ can be obtained from $G$ by a sequence of zero or more vertex deletions, edge deletions, and edge contractions. An edge contraction is an operation that removes an edge from a graph while simultaneously merging the two vertices that it previously connected.\n\nA graph property $P$ is said to be **minor-closed** if, for any graph $G$ that possesses property $P$, every minor $H$ of $G$ also possesses property $P$.

To show that having a Hamiltonian cycle is not minor-closed, we must find a pair $(G,H)$ where $H$ is a minor of $G$, $G$ has a Hamiltonian cycle, and $H$ does not.\n\nConsider option A. The graph $G_{A}$ consists of two triangles on vertex sets $\\{v_{1},v_{2},v_{3}\\}$ and $\\{v_{4},v_{5},v_{6}\\}$ with cross edges $(v_{1},v_{4})$ and $(v_{2},v_{5})$.

Hence $G_{A}$ is Hamiltonian.\n\nNow form $H_{A}$ by deleting the edge $(v_{2},v_{5})$. The resulting graph has exactly one cross edge $(v_{1},v_{4})$ connecting the two triangles, which is a bridge (cut-edge). A necessary condition for a graph to be Hamiltonian is that it is $2$-edge-connected; in particular, no Hamiltonian graph can contain a bridge, since any cycle avoids bridges. Therefore $H_{A}$ cannot possess a Hamiltonian cycle. Since $H_{A}$ is a minor of $G_{A}$ obtained by an edge deletion and $G_{A}$ is Hamiltonian while $H_{A}$ is not, option A is a valid counterexample showing the property is not minor-closed.\n\nFor completeness, options B and C both start with Hamiltonian graphs ($K_{5}$ and $C_{8}$, respectively) and their minors ($K_{4}$ and $C_{7}$, respectively) remain Hamiltonian, so they do not witness failure of minor-closedness.
