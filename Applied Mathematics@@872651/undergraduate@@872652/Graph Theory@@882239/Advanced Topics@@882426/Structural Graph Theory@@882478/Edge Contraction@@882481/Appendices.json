The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it. A fundamental operation on graphs is edge contraction. The contraction of an edge $e = \\{u, w\\}$ is the process of merging the two vertices $u$ and $w$ into a single new vertex, let's call it $v_{uw}$. In this process, the edge $e$ is removed, and any other edge that was incident to either $u$ or $w$ is now connected to the new vertex $v_{uw}$. Any loops or multiple edges created by this process are preserved in multigraph contexts, but for simple graphs, multiple edges are merged into a single edge.\n\nConsider a path graph $P_n$ for an integer $n \\ge 3$. Suppose we select one of the two edges that are incident to a vertex of degree 1.

Since $v_{1}$ had no neighbors other than $v_{2}$, and $v_{2}$ had neighbors $v_{1}$ and $v_{3}$, the only surviving adjacency involving $w$ is to $v_{3}$. No loops or multiple edges are created because $v_{1}$ was not adjacent to $v_{3}$ and the original graph is simple.\n\nThus the resulting graph has vertex set $\\{w,v_{3},v_{4},\\dots,v_{n}\\}$, which has $n-1$ vertices, and edge set\n$$\n\\{\\{w,v_{3}\\},\\{v_{3},v_{4}\\},\\dots,\\{v_{n-1},v_{n}\\}\\}.\n$$\nRelabel these vertices as $u_{1}=w$, $u_{2}=v_{3}$, $\\dots$, $u_{n-1}=v_{n}$.
