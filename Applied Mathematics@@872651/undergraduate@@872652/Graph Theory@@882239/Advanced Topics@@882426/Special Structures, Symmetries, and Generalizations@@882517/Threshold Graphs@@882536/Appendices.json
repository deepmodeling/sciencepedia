This exercise combines the constructive definition of threshold graphs with the classic graph theory problem of realizing a degree sequence, enhancing your ability to connect abstract properties to tangible graph structures.", "problem": "In network science, a \"threshold graph\" is a special type of graph that can be constructed sequentially from an empty graph. At each step of the construction, one can add a new vertex to the existing graph in one of two ways: either as an **isolated vertex** (a vertex with no edges to any existing vertices) or as a **dominating vertex** (a vertex connected by an edge to every existing vertex).\n\nA data scientist is analyzing a small collaboration network of five researchers. The number of collaborators for each researcher is measured, yielding the degree sequence $d = (4, 3, 2, 2, 1)$.

No, a threshold graph with this degree sequence cannot exist, although other simple graphs with this sequence might.", "solution": "We are given the nonincreasing degree sequence $d=(4,3,2,2,1)$ on $n=5$ vertices. First, we verify if it is graphic. The sum of degrees must be even:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{5} d_{i} = 4+3+2+2+1=12,\n$$\nwhich is even. We can apply the Havel–Hakimi algorithm to confirm it is graphic.

Deleting $u$ reduces the degrees of the remaining four vertices by $1$, resulting in the degree sequence $(3-1, 2-1, 2-1, 1-1) = (2,1,1,0)$. A graph on four vertices with degree sequence $(2,1,1,0)$ is uniquely determined up to isomorphism: it consists of an isolated vertex and a path on three vertices, $P_{3}$. Therefore, the original five-vertex graph is uniquely determined up to isomorphism: it is obtained by adding a universal vertex to a graph that is the disjoint union of a $P_3$ and an isolated vertex.\n\nNext, we verify that a threshold graph with this degree sequence exists by finding a valid creation sequence $S = c_1c_2c_3c_4c_5$. For example, consider the sequence $S=(0,0,1,0,1)$. Let's compute the degrees of the vertices $v_1, \\dots, v_5$:\n- $\\deg(v_1) = c_2+c_3+c_4+c_5 = 0+1+0+1=2$.\n- $\\deg(v_2) = c_2(1)+c_3+c_4+c_5 = 0(1)+1+0+1=2$.\n- $\\deg(v_3) = c_3(2)+c_4+c_5 = 1(2)+0+1=3$.\n- $\\deg(v_4) = c_4(3)+c_5 = 0(3)+1=1$.\n- $\\deg(v_5) = c_5(4) = 1(4)=4$.\n\nThe resulting degree multiset is $\\{4,3,2,2,1\\}$, which matches $d$.
