A sequence of valid choices that maximizes the final size is:\nchoose $e_{1}$ and pick $x$, then choose $e_{2}$ and pick $y$, then choose $e_{3}$ and pick $z$. At this point $T=\\{x,y,z\\}$, and the only un-hit edge is $e_{4}$. The algorithm then chooses $e_{4}$ (its size is now the minimum among un-hit edges) and adds an arbitrary vertex from it, say $w$, yielding $T=\\{x,y,z,w\\}$. This execution is valid and produces $|T|=4$. Moreover, in each iteration the algorithm selects a vertex from an un-hit edge, so it always hits at least one previously un-hit edge; thus the number of iterations cannot exceed the number of edges, which is $4$.
