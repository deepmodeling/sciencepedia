This practice exercise provides a tangible scenario involving network data packets to illustrate how abstract mathematical concepts can model real-world problems. By translating the problem of \"non-interfering swaps\" into the graph-theoretic concept of a matching, you will gain hands-on experience with the definition of a permutation graph and apply your knowledge to find a maximum matching, a core problem in graph theory [@problem_id:1526956].", "problem": "A network router employs a special buffer to manage and re-sequence out-of-order data packets. The buffer has $n$ positions, labeled $1, 2, \\dots, n$. At a given moment, the arrangement of packets in the buffer is described by a permutation $\\pi$ of the set $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$, where $\\pi(i)$ denotes the unique packet number located at buffer position $i$.\n\nThe router's control logic is designed to identify \"inverted pairs\" of positions. A pair of positions $(i, j)$ with $i  j$ is classified as an inverted pair if the packet at position $i$ has a larger sequence number than the packet at position $j$, meaning $\\pi(i) > \\pi(j)$. These inverted pairs represent conflicts that need to be resolved.\n\nTo optimize the re-sequencing process, the router attempts to perform a set of simultaneous corrective swaps. A single corrective swap operates on one inverted pair. A set of such swaps is considered \"non-interfering\" if no two swaps in the set involve the same buffer position. The router's objective is to determine the maximum number of non-interfering corrective swaps that can be executed in a single parallel step.\n\nConsider a buffer of size $n=6$. The packet arrangement is given by the permutation $\\pi = (3, 6, 1, 5, 2, 4)$. What is the maximum number of non-interfering corrective swaps that can be performed simultaneously?", "solution": "The problem asks for the maximum number of non-interfering corrective swaps for a given packet arrangement in a buffer. This can be modeled using graph theory.\n\nFirst, let's formalize the problem. The buffer positions $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$ can be represented as the set of vertices $V$ of a graph $G = (V, E)$. The \"inverted pairs\" define the edges of this graph. An edge exists between two vertices $i$ and $j$ if and only if they form an inverted pair. According to the problem statement, an edge $(i, j)$ is in the edge set $E$ if $i  j$ and $\\pi(i) > \\pi(j)$. This construction defines a permutation graph.\n\nA \"set of non-interfering corrective swaps\" corresponds to a set of edges in $G$ where no two edges share a common vertex. This is precisely the definition of a matching in a graph. The problem of finding the \"maximum number of non-interfering corrective swaps\" is therefore equivalent to finding the size of a maximum matching in the permutation graph $G$ corresponding to $\\pi$. The size of a maximum matching is also known as the matching number of the graph, denoted $\\alpha'(G)$.\n\nThe given permutation is $\\pi = (3, 6, 1, 5, 2, 4)$ on the set of positions $V = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. We need to find all pairs $(i, j)$ with $i  j$ such that $\\pi(i) > \\pi(j)$. These pairs will form the edge set $E$.\n\nLet's systematically check for all possible pairs $(i, j)$ where $1 \\le i  j \\le 6$:\n\n- For $i=1$ ($\\pi(1)=3$):\n  - $j=2$: $\\pi(2)=6$. $3  6$. No edge.\n  - $j=3$: $\\pi(3)=1$. $3 > 1$. Edge $(1, 3)$ exists.\n  - $j=4$: $\\pi(4)=5$. $3  5$. No edge.\n  - $j=5$: $\\pi(5)=2$. $3 > 2$. Edge $(1, 5)$ exists.\n  - $j=6$: $\\pi(6)=4$. $3  4$. No edge.\n\n- For $i=2$ ($\\pi(2)=6$):\n  - $j=3$: $\\pi(3)=1$. $6 > 1$. Edge $(2, 3)$ exists.\n  - $j=4$: $\\pi(4)=5$. $6 > 5$. Edge $(2, 4)$ exists.\n  - $j=5$: $\\pi(5)=2$. $6 > 2$. Edge $(2, 5)$ exists.\n  - $j=6$: $\\pi(6)=4$. $6 > 4$. Edge $(2, 6)$ exists.\n\n- For $i=3$ ($\\pi(3)=1$):\n  - The value $\\pi(3)=1$ is the minimum possible, so it cannot be greater than any other $\\pi(j)$. No edges with $i=3$.\n\n- For $i=4$ ($\\pi(4)=5$):\n  - $j=5$: $\\pi(5)=2$. $5 > 2$. Edge $(4, 5)$ exists.\n  - $j=6$: $\\pi(6)=4$. $5 > 4$. Edge $(4, 6)$ exists.\n\n- For $i=5$ ($\\pi(5)=2$):\n  - $j=6$: $\\pi(6)=4$. $2  4$. No edge.\n\nSo, the edge set of the graph $G$ is $E = \\{(1, 3), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (2, 6), (4, 5), (4, 6)\\}$.\n\nNow we need to find the maximum matching in this graph. A matching is a subset of $E$ where no two edges share a vertex. We can find this by inspection or by trying to construct a large matching.\nLet's try to build a matching:\n\n- Consider the edge $(1, 5)$. The vertices $1$ and $5$ are now used. The remaining available vertices are $\\{2, 3, 4, 6\\}$.\n- From the remaining vertices, we look for an edge in $E$ that connects two of them. The edge $(2, 3)$ works. Now vertices $2$ and $3$ are used. The remaining available vertices are $\\{4, 6\\}$.\n- From the remaining vertices, we look for an edge. The edge $(4, 6)$ is in $E$.\n\nThis gives us the matching $M = \\{(1, 5), (2, 3), (4, 6)\\}$.\nLet's verify this is a valid matching. The vertices involved are $\\{1, 5\\}$, $\\{2, 3\\}$, and $\\{4, 6\\}$. All six vertices are distinct across the pairs, so no two edges share a vertex. Thus, $M$ is a valid matching.\n\nThe size of this matching is $|M| = 3$.\nA matching in a graph with $n$ vertices can have a maximum size of $\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$. In our case, $n=6$, so the maximum possible size of any matching is $\\lfloor 6/2 \\rfloor = 3$.\nSince we have found a matching of size 3, this must be a maximum matching. This particular matching is also a perfect matching, as it includes all vertices of the graph.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of non-interfering corrective swaps that can be performed simultaneously is 3.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "1526956"}, {"introduction": "Once you can construct a permutation graph, a deeper question arises: how does the structure of the permutation itself dictate the global properties of the graph?

The graph's vertices are the numbers $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, and an edge connects $i$ and $j$ if their numerical order is different from their positional order in the permutation sequence. Let's analyze condition D.\n\nA permutation satisfying condition D is called \"decomposable.\" It means there is some $k$ (where $1 \\le k  n$) such that the first $k$ positions in the permutation sequence are filled exclusively by the numbers from $\\{1, \\dots, k\\}$.\n\n**Sufficiency (D implies Disconnected):**\nAssume condition D holds. Then there exists a $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, n-1\\}$ such that the permutation $\\pi$ maps the positions $\\{1, \\dots, k\\}$ to the values $\\{1, \\dots, k\\}$. Because $\\pi$ is a bijection, it must also map the remaining positions $\\{k+1, \\dots, n\\}$ to the remaining values $\\{k+1, \\dots, n\\}$.\nThis property has a direct consequence on the positions $\\pi^{-1}(v)$ for any value $v$:\n- If a value $i$ is in $\\{1, \\dots, k\\}$, its position $\\pi^{-1}(i)$ must be in $\\{1, \\dots, k\\}$.\n- If a value $j$ is in $\\{k+1, \\dots, n\\}$, its position $\\pi^{-1}(j)$ must be in $\\{k+1, \\dots, n\\}$.\n\nNow, consider an arbitrary pair of vertices with $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, k\\}$ and $j \\in \\{k+1, \\dots, n\\}$.

Since the condition for an edge is that this product be negative, no edge can exist between any vertex in the set $\\{1, \\dots, k\\}$ and any vertex in the set $\\{k+1, \\dots, n\\}$. This partitions the graph's vertices into at least two sets with no edges between them, proving that the graph $G(\\pi)$ is disconnected.\n\n**Necessity (Disconnected implies D):**\nConversely, if the graph $G(\\pi)$ is disconnected, it means the set of vertices $V$ can be partitioned into two non-empty sets, say $A$ and $B$, such that there are no edges between any vertex in $A$ and any vertex in $B$. It can be proven that such a partition is only possible if it aligns with the natural ordering of the integers. That is, there must exist an integer $k$ ($1 \\le k  n$) such that one of the sets is $\\{1, \\dots, k\\}$ and the other is $\\{k+1, \\dots, n\\}$. The absence of edges between these two sets implies that for any $i \\le k$ and $j > k$, the product $(i-j)(\\pi^{-1}(i) - \\pi^{-1}(j))$ must be non-negative. Since $i  j$, this forces $\\pi^{-1}(i)  \\pi^{-1}(j)$. This means that all numbers from $\\{1, \\dots, k\\}$ must appear in the permutation sequence before all numbers from $\\{k+1, \\dots, n\\}$. This is only possible if the positions occupied by $\\{1, \\dots, k\\}$ are exactly $\\{1, \\dots, k\\}$, which is condition D.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nCondition D is both necessary and sufficient for $G(\\pi)$ to be disconnected.

Combining these, we get $p_\\sigma(k) = p_r(n+1-k) = n+1 - p(n+1-k)$.\nAn edge $\\{i, j\\}$ exists in $G(\\sigma)$ if $(i-j)(p_\\sigma(i)-p_\\sigma(j))  0$. Substituting $p_\\sigma$:\n$(i-j)([n+1 - p(n+1-i)] - [n+1-p(n+1-j)])  0$\nThis simplifies to $(i-j)(p(n+1-j) - p(n+1-i))  0$.\nLet $i' = n+1-i$ and $j' = n+1-j$. Then $i-j = -(i'-j')$.
