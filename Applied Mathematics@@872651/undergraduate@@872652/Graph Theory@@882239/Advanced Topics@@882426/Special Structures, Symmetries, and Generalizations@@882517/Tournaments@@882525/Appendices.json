An edge $(u,v)$ signifies that player $u$ defeated player $v$.\n\nA fascinating property of any tournament is that it always contains a *Hamiltonian path*—a directed path that visits every vertex exactly once. Such a path provides a complete ranking of all players, $(p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n)$, where player $p_1$ beat $p_2$, $p_2$ beat $p_3$, and so on.\n\nConsider a tournament with 6 players, labeled {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.

To incorporate a new vertex $u$ (not in $P_k$) to form a path $P_{k+1}$ on $k+1$ vertices, follow these steps. Let the current path be $P_k = (v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_k)$.\n1.  If player $u$ beats player $v_1$ (i.e., the edge $(u, v_1)$ exists), create the new path by placing $u$ at the beginning: $P_{k+1} = (u, v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_k)$.\n2.  If the first case does not apply, check if player $v_k$ beats player $u$ (i.e., the edge $(v_k, u)$ exists). If so, create the new path by placing $u$ at the end: $P_{k+1} = (v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_k, u)$.\n3.  If neither of the first two cases applies, there must be an index $i$ ($1 \\le i  k$) such that player $v_i$ beats player $u$ and player $u$ beats player $v_{i+1}$. Find the smallest such index $i$ and insert $u$ into the path between $v_i$ and $v_{i+1}$: $P_{k+1} = (v_1, \\dots, v_i, u, v_{i+1}, \\dots, v_k)$.\n\nStarting with an initial path consisting of only vertex 1, apply this algorithm to incrementally add vertices 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, in this specific order.
