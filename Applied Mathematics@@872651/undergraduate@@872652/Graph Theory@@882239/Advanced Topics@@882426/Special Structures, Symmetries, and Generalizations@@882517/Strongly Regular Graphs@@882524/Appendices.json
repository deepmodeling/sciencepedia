We first show that $N(u)$ induces a clique. Take any distinct $v,w \\in N(u)$. If $v$ and $w$ were non-adjacent, then $v$ and $w$ would be a pair of non-adjacent vertices that share a common neighbor $u$, contradicting $\\mu=0$. Therefore every pair in $N(u)$ is adjacent, so the subgraph induced by $N(u)$ is a complete graph on $k$ vertices.\n\nNext, consider any vertex $x$ that is not adjacent to $u$. For any $y \\in N(u)$, if $x$ were adjacent to $y$, then $x$ and $u$ would be a pair of non-adjacent vertices having a common neighbor $y$, again contradicting $\\mu=0$.

Since $G$ is given to be connected, there can be only one such component, and thus $G$ must itself be a complete graph $K_{k+1}$.\n\nAmong the options provided, this corresponds to the statement that $G$ must be a complete graph.\n\nNote: Although the formal definition of an SRG excludes complete graphs, the structural consequence of the condition $\\mu=0$ together with connectedness forces $G$ to be complete.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1536241"}]}
