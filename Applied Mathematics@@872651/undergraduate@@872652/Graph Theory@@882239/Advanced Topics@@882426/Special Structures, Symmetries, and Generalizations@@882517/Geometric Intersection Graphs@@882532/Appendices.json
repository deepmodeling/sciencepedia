To see this, label the four vertices arbitrarily and assign the same interval to each, for example\n$$\nf(v)=[0,1] \\text{ for all } v.\n$$\nThen for any distinct $u,v$, $f(u)\\cap f(v)=[0,1]\\neq \\emptyset$, so every pair is adjacent, realizing $K_{4}$.\n\nSecond, $P_{5}$ is an interval graph. Label the path vertices $v_{1},v_{2},v_{3},v_{4},v_{5}$ in order and assign\n$$\nf(v_{i})=[i,i+1] \\text{ for } i\\in\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}.\n$$\nFor $i<j$, if $j=i+1$ then\n$$\nf(v_{i})\\cap f(v_{j})=[i,i+1]\\cap [i+1,i+2]=\\{i+1\\}\\neq \\emptyset,\n$$\nso $(v_{i},v_{i+1})$ is an edge. If $j\\geq i+2$, then $i+1 \\leq j$ implies\n$$\n[i,i+1]\\cap [j,j+1]=\\emptyset,\n$$\nso there is no edge between nonconsecutive vertices. Hence the interval intersections realize exactly the edges of $P_{5}$.\n\nThird, consider $C_{4}$ and $C_{5}$. A key structural fact is that every interval graph is chordal. To justify this, order the vertices by nondecreasing right endpoints $e_{v}$, and consider a vertex $v$ with minimum $e_{v}$. If $u$ is adjacent to $v$, then $f(u)$ must intersect $f(v)$ and, since $e_{u}\\geq e_{v}$ by minimality of $e_{v}$, we have $s_{u}\\leq e_{v}$; hence $e_{v}\\in f(u)$. Therefore, every neighbor of $v$ contains the common point $e_{v}$, so the neighborhood of $v$ is a clique. This gives a perfect elimination ordering, which is equivalent to chordality. Since chordal graphs have no induced cycles of length at least $4$, both $C_{4}$ and $C_{5}$ are not interval graphs because each is an induced cycle of length at least $4$ without a chord.\n\nIn summary, $K_{4}$ and $P_{5}$ are interval graphs, while $C_{4}$ and $C_{5}$ are not.

This means there exist graphs that can be represented by intersecting chords on a circle but not by intersecting intervals on a line.\n\nConsidering all possible simple, undirected graphs, what is the number of vertices in a graph with the minimum possible number of vertices that is a circle graph but is not an interval graph?", "solution": "We seek the smallest $n$ such that there exists an $n$-vertex graph which is a circle graph but not an interval graph.\n\nFirst, recall a standard characterization: interval graphs are chordal, meaning they contain no induced cycle of length at least $4$. Therefore, any cycle $C_{n}$ with $n \\geq 4$ is not an interval graph. In particular, $C_{4}$ is not an interval graph.\n\nNext, we check whether $C_{4}$ is a circle graph. A graph is a circle graph if it can be realized as the alternance graph of a double-occurrence word on a circle: two vertices are adjacent if and only if their corresponding letters alternate (their two occurrences are interleaved around the circle).\n\nConsider the double-occurrence word\n$$\nA\\,C\\,D\\,B\\,C\\,A\\,B\\,D.\n$$\nPlace these eight symbols around a circle in this cyclic order, and associate to each letter its chord joining its two occurrences. Two chords cross if and only if the corresponding letters alternate.\n\nVerify adjacencies:\n- $A$ occurs at positions $1$ and $6$; $B$ at $4$ and $7$; $D$ at $3$ and $8$; $C$ at $2$ and $5$.\n- $A$ alternates with $B$ (one $B$ between $A$'s and one outside) and with $D$, but not with $C$ (both $C$'s lie between the $A$'s). Hence edges $A\\text{--}B$ and $A\\text{--}D$, but not $A\\text{--}C$.\n- $B$ alternates with $C$ (order $C\\,B\\,C\\,B$) but not with $D$ (order $B\\,D\\,D\\,B$). Hence edges $B\\text{--}C$ and no $B\\text{--}D$.\n- $C$ alternates with $D$ (order $C\\,D\\,C\\,D$), giving edge $C\\text{--}D$.\n\nThus the intersection graph is exactly the $4$-cycle $C_{4}$, which is therefore a circle graph but not an interval graph.\n\nFinally, we establish minimality. For $n=1,2,3$, every simple graph is an interval graph: an independent set is realized by pairwise disjoint intervals; a single edge by two overlapping intervals and others disjoint; $P_{3}$ by three intervals forming a chain of overlaps; $K_{3}$ by three intervals with a common overlap. Hence no graph on fewer than $4$ vertices can be a circle graph without also being an interval graph.\n\nTherefore, the minimum possible number of vertices is $4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "1506626"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply identifying or classifying graphs, the true power of geometric representations lies in how they can transform difficult graph problems into more manageable ones in other domains.
