These conflicts can be modeled using an interval graph. Consider a project with six tasks, labeled A, B, C, D, E, and F.

This knowledge is key to classifying graphs and choosing the right analytical tools. This practice challenges you to think critically about the geometric constraints of intervals on a line, guiding you to prove why the simple four-vertex cycle, $C_4$, is a classic example of a non-interval graph ([@problem_id:1534410]). This exercise illuminates the concept of \"forbidden induced subgraphs,\" a cornerstone of graph theory.", "problem": "An undirected graph $G=(V, E)$ is called an **interval graph** if its vertices can be put into one-to-one correspondence with a set of intervals on the real line, such that two vertices are adjacent if and only if their corresponding intervals have a non-empty intersection.\n\nConsider the cycle graph on four vertices, denoted as $C_4$. This graph has a vertex set $V = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4\\}$ and an edge set $E = \\{(v_1, v_2), (v_2, v_3), (v_3, v_4), (v_4, v_1)\\}$. The graph $C_4$ is a well-known example of a graph that is *not* an interval graph.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides a correct and rigorous explanation for why $C_4$ cannot be an interval graph?\n\nA. Let the vertices be labeled in cyclic order. The non-adjacent vertices $v_1$ and $v_3$ share the same neighborhood, $\\{v_2, v_4\\}$. If an interval representation existed, the necessarily disjoint intervals for $v_1$ and $v_3$ would both need to be intersected by the intervals for $v_2$ and $v_4$. This would force the intervals for $v_2$ and $v_4$ to both span the gap between the intervals for $v_1$ and $v_3$, causing them to intersect. This contradicts the fact that $v_2$ and $v_4$ are non-adjacent.\n\nB. The graph $C_4$ is not an interval graph because it is a bipartite graph. Many bipartite graphs, such as complete bipartite graphs $K_{m,n}$ where $m,n \\ge 2$, are not interval graphs, and $C_4$ falls into this category by virtue of its structure.\n\nC. Any cycle graph $C_n$ with $n \\ge 4$ vertices cannot be an interval graph. The attempt to arrange intervals on a one-dimensional line to represent a cyclic structure will always fail, because the interval for the last vertex $v_n$ must intersect the interval for the first vertex $v_1$ without intersecting other required non-adjacent vertices, which is geometrically impossible.\n\nD. A graph is an interval graph if and only if it does not contain an asteroidal triple (an independent set of three vertices such that there is a path between any two that does not contain any neighbor of the third vertex) and is chordal. The graph $C_4$ contains an asteroidal triple, specifically the vertices $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$, and is therefore not an interval graph.", "solution": "We recall the definition: in an interval representation, two vertices are adjacent if and only if their corresponding intervals intersect, and non-adjacent vertices must have disjoint intervals.\n\nAssume, for contradiction, that $C_{4}$ has an interval representation. Label the vertices cyclically as $v_{1},v_{2},v_{3},v_{4}$, and let their intervals be $I_{1},I_{2},I_{3},I_{4}$, respectively. Since $v_{1}$ and $v_{3}$ are non-adjacent, their intervals must be disjoint: $I_{1}\\cap I_{3}=\\varnothing$. Because $v_{2}$ is adjacent to both $v_{1}$ and $v_{3}$, its interval must intersect both $I_{1}$ and $I_{3}$: $I_{2}\\cap I_{1}\\neq\\varnothing$ and $I_{2}\\cap I_{3}\\neq\\varnothing$. Similarly, $v_{4}$ is adjacent to both $v_{1}$ and $v_{3}$, so $I_{4}\\cap I_{1}\\neq\\varnothing$ and $I_{4}\\cap I_{3}\\neq\\varnothing$.\n\nLet the disjoint intervals $I_{1}$ and $I_{3}$ be separated on the real line by a nonempty open gap $G$, namely the open interval between the right endpoint of $I_{1}$ and the left endpoint of $I_{3}$ (or vice-versa). For an interval to intersect both $I_{1}$ and $I_{3}$, it must contain a point in $I_{1}$ and a point in $I_{3}$. Since intervals are convex subsets of the real line, any such interval must contain the entire closed segment between those two points, and in particular it must contain the gap $G$. Therefore both $I_{2}$ and $I_{4}$ contain $G$, which implies $I_{2}\\cap I_{4}\\neq\\varnothing$.\n\nHowever, $v_{2}$ and $v_{4}$ are non-adjacent in $C_{4}$, so their intervals must be disjoint. This contradiction shows that no interval representation of $C_{4}$ exists. This is exactly the rigorous reasoning presented in option A.\n\nOption B offers invalid reasoning. Being bipartite does not preclude a graph from being an interval graph; for instance, path graphs are both bipartite and interval graphs. Therefore, citing bipartiteness is not a valid reason for $C_4$ not being an interval graph. Option C states a true fact (cycles $C_{n}$ with $n\\geq 4$ are not interval graphs) but gives a non-rigorous justification. Option D cites a correct characterization of interval graphs (chordal and AT-free) but makes two factual errors: $C_4$ does not contain an asteroidal triple, and the vertices $\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\}$ are not an independent set. The reason $C_4$ is not an interval graph is that it is not chordal (it is an induced 4-cycle), which alone suffices to rule it out.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1534410"}, {"introduction": "The true power of studying special graph classes like interval graphs lies in their application to complex problems that can be solved with surprising efficiency.
