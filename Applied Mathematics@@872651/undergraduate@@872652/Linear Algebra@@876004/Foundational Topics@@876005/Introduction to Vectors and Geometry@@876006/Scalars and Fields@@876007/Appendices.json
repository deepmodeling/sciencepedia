This exercise provides a concrete opportunity to perform calculations in such a field, moving beyond theoretical definitions to hands-on computation.

The state of the machine at any given time is represented by an element of the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_p=\\mathbb{Z}_p$, which consists of the set of integers $\\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, p-1\\}$ with addition and multiplication performed modulo a prime number $p$.\n\nThe state transition is governed by the following update rule. A new state, $S_{new}$, is calculated from an initial state, $S_{old}$, and two control inputs, $x$ and $y$, according to the expression:\n$$ S_{new} = (x - S_{old}) \\cdot (y+x)^{-1} $$\nwhere $(y+x)^{-1}$ denotes the multiplicative inverse of $(y+x)$ in the field $\\mathbb{F}_p$.\n\nSuppose the machine operates in the field $\\mathbb{F}_{13}$ (i.e., $p=13$).

All arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and inversion) are to be performed modulo 13.\n\nFirst, we substitute the given values into the expression:\n$$ S_{new} = (4 - 7) \\cdot (11+4)^{-1} \\pmod{13} $$\n\nWe evaluate the terms inside the parentheses separately.\n\nLet's calculate the first term, $(4 - 7)$:\n$$ 4 - 7 = -3 $$\nTo express this value as an element of $\\mathbb{F}_{13} = \\{0, 1, ..., 12\\}$, we find its equivalent value modulo 13.\n$$ -3 \\pmod{13} \\equiv -3 + 13 \\pmod{13} \\equiv 10 \\pmod{13} $$\nSo, the first term is $10$.\n\nNext, let's calculate the term that needs to be inverted, $(11+4)$:\n$$ 11 + 4 = 15 $$\nWe reduce this value modulo 13:\n$$ 15 \\pmod{13} \\equiv 2 \\pmod{13} $$\nSo, the term to be inverted is $2$.\n\nNow, our expression for $S_{new}$ simplifies to:\n$$ S_{new} = 10 \\cdot 2^{-1} \\pmod{13} $$\n\nThe next step is to find the multiplicative inverse of $2$ in $\\mathbb{F}_{13}$, denoted as $2^{-1}$. This is the number $z$ in the set $\\{1, 2, ..., 12\\}$ such that $2 \\cdot z \\equiv 1 \\pmod{13}$. We can find this by inspection or by using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
