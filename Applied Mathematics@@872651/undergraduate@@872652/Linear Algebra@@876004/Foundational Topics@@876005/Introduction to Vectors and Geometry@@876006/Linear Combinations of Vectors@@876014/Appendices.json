Determine which of the following statements is true regarding the ability to represent an arbitrary polynomial $q(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$, where $a, b,$ and $c$ are any real numbers, as a linear combination of $p_1(x)$, $p_2(x)$, and $p_3(x)$.\n\nA) Yes, any such polynomial can be expressed as a unique linear combination of $p_1(x)$, $p_2(x)$, and $p_3(x)$.\n\nB) No, because the set of polynomials $\\{p_1(x), p_2(x), p_3(x)\\}$ is linearly dependent.\n\nC) No, a linear combination is only possible if the coefficients of the target polynomial satisfy the relation $a+b-c=0$.\n\nD) No, because none of the given polynomials have a degree of exactly zero, making it impossible to form an arbitrary constant term $c$.\n\nE) A linear combination is possible for any target polynomial, but it is not unique.", "solution": "The problem asks whether an arbitrary polynomial $q(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ can be written as a linear combination of the polynomials $p_1(x)=x^2+1$, $p_2(x)=x-2$, and $p_3(x)=x^2+x$.\n\nTo determine this, we set up an equation that represents the linear combination. We are looking for scalar coefficients $k_1, k_2, k_3$ such that for any choice of $a, b, c$:\n$$k_1 p_1(x) + k_2 p_2(x) + k_3 p_3(x) = q(x)$$\n\nSubstitute the given polynomials into the equation:\n$$k_1 (x^2 + 1) + k_2 (x - 2) + k_3 (x^2 + x) = ax^2 + bx + c$$\n\nNext, we expand the left side and group the terms by powers of $x$:\n$$(k_1 x^2 + k_1) + (k_2 x - 2k_2) + (k_3 x^2 + k_3 x) = ax^2 + bx + c$$\n$$(k_1 + k_3)x^2 + (k_2 + k_3)x + (k_1 - 2k_2) = ax^2 + bx + c$$\n\nFor two polynomials to be equal, the coefficients of corresponding powers of $x$ must be equal. This gives us a system of three linear equations with three unknowns ($k_1, k_2, k_3$):\n1. Coefficient of $x^2$: $k_1 + k_3 = a$\n2. Coefficient of $x^1$: $k_2 + k_3 = b$\n3. Coefficient of $x^0$ (the constant term): $k_1 - 2k_2 = c$\n\nThis system of linear equations can be written in matrix form $A\\mathbf{k} = \\mathbf{v}$, where:\n$$ A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{k} = \\begin{pmatrix} k_1 \\\\ k_2 \\\\ k_3 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\\\ c \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThe question of whether we can find a set of coefficients $\\{k_1, k_2, k_3\\}$ for *any* choice of $\\{a, b, c\\}$ is equivalent to asking if the coefficient matrix $A$ is invertible. A square matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is non-zero. Let's calculate the determinant of $A$ using cofactor expansion along the first row:\n$$ \\det(A) = 1 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ -2 & 0 \\end{vmatrix} - 0 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{vmatrix} + 1 \\cdot \\begin{vmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -2 \\end{vmatrix} $$\n$$ \\det(A) = 1 \\cdot ((1)(0) - (1)(-2)) - 0 + 1 \\cdot ((0)(-2) - (1)(1)) $$\n$$ \\det(A) = 1 \\cdot (0 + 2) + 1 \\cdot (0 - 1) $$\n$$ \\det(A) = 2 - 1 = 1 $$\n\nSince the determinant of the coefficient matrix $A$ is $1$, which is non-zero, the matrix $A$ is invertible. This has two important consequences:\n1. For any vector $\\mathbf{v} = (a, b, c)^T$, there exists a solution for $\\mathbf{k}$, given by $\\mathbf{k} = A^{-1}\\mathbf{v}$. This means any polynomial $q(x)$ in $P_2$ can be formed by a linear combination of $p_1, p_2, p_3$.\n2. Because the matrix is invertible, the solution $\\mathbf{k}$ is unique for any given $\\mathbf{v}$.\n\nTherefore, any polynomial $q(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ can be expressed as a *unique* linear combination of $p_1(x)$, $p_2(x)$, and $p_3(x)$. The set $\\{p_1, p_2, p_3\\}$ forms a basis for the vector space $P_2$.\n\nLet's review the options:\nA) Yes, any such polynomial can be expressed as a unique linear combination of $p_1(x)$, $p_2(x)$, and $p_3(x)$. - This matches our conclusion.\nB) No, because the set of polynomials $\\{p_1(x), p_2(x), p_3(x)\\}$ is linearly dependent. - This is false. A non-zero determinant implies the column vectors (and thus the corresponding polynomials) are linearly independent.\nC) No, a linear combination is only possible if the coefficients of the target polynomial satisfy the relation $a+b-c=0$. - This would be true if the determinant were zero, implying a condition on $a, b, c$ for a solution to exist. Since the determinant is non-zero, no such constraint exists.\nD) No, because none of the given polynomials have a degree of exactly zero, making it impossible to form an arbitrary constant term $c$. - This is false. The constant term of the linear combination is $k_1 - 2k_2$, which can be set to any real value $c$ by choosing appropriate $k_1$ and $k_2$.\nE) A linear combination is possible for any target polynomial, but it is not unique. - This is false. Uniqueness is guaranteed by the invertibility of the matrix $A$.\n\nThus, the only correct statement is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1372759"}]}
