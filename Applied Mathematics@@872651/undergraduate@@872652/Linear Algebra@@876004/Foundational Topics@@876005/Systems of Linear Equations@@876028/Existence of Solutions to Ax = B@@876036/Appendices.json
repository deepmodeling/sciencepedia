The relative proportions of three key metallic elements, denoted by $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$, are governed by a system of linear equations derived from experimental constraints.

A linear system $Ax=b$ is fundamentally asking whether the vector $b$ can be constructed from a linear combination of the columns of $A$. This exercise challenges you to think in terms of vector spaces, specifically the column space, to explain why for certain shapes of matrices, it is impossible for solutions to exist for every possible vector $b$ [@problem_id:1361402].", "problem": "In a signal processing experiment, a system of 5 sensors is used to detect signals originating from 3 independent sources. The relationship between the vector of source strengths, $x = \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$, and the vector of sensor measurements, $b = \\begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\\\ b_2 \\\\ b_3 \\\\ b_4 \\\\ b_5 \\end{pmatrix} \\in \\mathbb{R}^5$, is described by the linear system $Ax = b$. Here, $A$ is a $5 \\times 3$ matrix determined by the physical characteristics of the setup. It is known that the three sources are genuinely independent and positioned such that the columns of matrix $A$ are linearly independent.\n\nAn engineer claims that for any possible set of non-zero sensor readings $b$, it is always possible to determine the unique source strengths $x$ that caused them. This implies that the system $Ax=b$ is consistent for any vector $b \\in \\mathbb{R}^5$.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly evaluates the engineer's claim and provides the correct reasoning?\n\nA. The claim is correct. Because there are more sensors than sources (5  3), the system is overdetermined, which guarantees that a unique solution for the source strengths $x$ can always be found.\n\nB. The claim is incorrect. The set of all possible sensor readings $b$ that can be generated is a subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ whose dimension is at most 3. Since the dimension of the entire space of readings $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is 5, there must exist vectors $b$ that cannot be generated.\n\nC. The claim is correct. The problem states that the columns of $A$ are linearly independent, which means the null space of $A$ contains only the zero vector. This guarantees that a solution to $Ax=b$ exists for any $b$.\n\nD. The claim is incorrect. A linear system $Ax=b$ can only have a solution if the number of rows in $A$ is less than or equal to the number of columns. Since there are 5 rows and 3 columns, a solution can exist only if $b$ is the zero vector.\n\nE. The claim is correct. One can always compute the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse, $A^+$, for the matrix $A$. The solution can then be found using $x = A^+b$, which will exist for any vector $b$.", "solution": "The problem asks us to evaluate the claim that the linear system $Ax=b$ has a solution for any vector $b \\in \\mathbb{R}^5$, where $A$ is a $5 \\times 3$ matrix with linearly independent columns.\n\nA linear system $Ax=b$ is consistent (i.e., has at least one solution $x$) if and only if the vector $b$ is in the column space of the matrix $A$, denoted as $\\text{Col}(A)$. The column space of $A$ is the set of all possible linear combinations of its column vectors.\n\nLet the columns of the $5 \\times 3$ matrix $A$ be $v_1, v_2, v_3$. Each of these column vectors is in $\\mathbb{R}^5$.\n$$ A = \\begin{pmatrix} |  |  | \\\\ v_1  v_2  v_3 \\\\ |  |  | \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe product $Ax$ can be written as a linear combination of these columns:\n$$ Ax = x_1 v_1 + x_2 v_2 + x_3 v_3 $$\nwhere $x = \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe set of all possible vectors $b$ that can be formed by the product $Ax$ is therefore the set of all linear combinations of the columns of $A$. This is the definition of the column space of $A$.\n$$ \\text{Col}(A) = \\text{span}\\{v_1, v_2, v_3\\} $$\n\nThe dimension of the column space is equal to the rank of the matrix $A$. The rank of an $m \\times n$ matrix is at most $\\min(m, n)$. For our $5 \\times 3$ matrix $A$, the rank is at most $\\min(5, 3) = 3$. The problem states that the columns of $A$ are linearly independent, which means the rank of $A$ is exactly 3. Therefore, the dimension of the column space is 3.\n$$ \\dim(\\text{Col}(A)) = \\text{rank}(A) = 3 $$\n\nThe column space, $\\text{Col}(A)$, is a subspace of the larger vector space $\\mathbb{R}^5$. The dimension of $\\mathbb{R}^5$ is 5.\nSince the dimension of the column space (3) is strictly less than the dimension of the ambient space $\\mathbb{R}^5$ (5), the column space cannot be the entire space $\\mathbb{R}^5$. In other words, $\\text{Col}(A) \\neq \\mathbb{R}^5$.\n\nThis means that there must exist vectors $b$ in $\\mathbb{R}^5$ that are not in the column space of $A$. For any such vector $b$, the equation $Ax=b$ has no solution. Therefore, the engineer's claim that the system is consistent for any vector $b \\in \\mathbb{R}^5$ is incorrect.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options:\n\n*   **A**: This is incorrect. An overdetermined system (more equations than unknowns) is often inconsistent, not guaranteed to have a solution.\n*   **B**: This is correct. It accurately identifies that the set of all possible outputs $b$ (the column space) is a subspace of $\\mathbb{R}^5$. It correctly states that the dimension of this subspace is at most 3. Because $3  5$, this subspace cannot fill all of $\\mathbb{R}^5$, meaning there are vectors $b$ for which no solution exists.\n*   **C**: This is incorrect. The fact that the columns of $A$ are linearly independent means that the null space of $A$ is trivial (contains only the zero vector). This condition, $\\text{Nul}(A) = \\{0\\}$, guarantees that *if* a solution exists, it is unique. It does not guarantee existence for all $b$.\n*   **D**: This is an incorrect generalization. While systems with more rows than columns are often inconsistent, they can have solutions if $b$ is in the column space of $A$. Stating that a solution can only exist for $b=0$ is false.\n*   **E**: This is incorrect. The pseudoinverse $A^+$ gives the least-squares solution $x = A^+b$. This solution minimizes the error norm $\\|Ax-b\\|$. If $b$ is not in the column space of $A$, then $Ax-b \\neq 0$ for all $x$, so the least-squares solution is not an exact solution to $Ax=b$.\n\nThus, the only correct reasoning is provided in option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1361402"}]}
