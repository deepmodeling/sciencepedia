The state of the system at equilibrium is described by the quantities of these components, denoted by the variables $x_1, x_2,$ and $x_3$, respectively. Based on established physical laws and experimental observations, the relationships between these quantities are governed by a system of three linear equations.\n\nThe relationships are as follows:\n1. A total inventory count reveals that the sum of twice the quantity of Type 1, five times the quantity of Type 2, and three times the quantity of Type 3 is constant.\n2. An internal process constraint, which does not involve Type 1 components, dictates that four times the quantity of Type 2 components is directly offset by two times the quantity of Type 3 components, resulting in a constant value.\n3. The quantity of Type 3 components is controlled by an external calibration parameter $\\lambda$, which is known to be a positive real number. This relationship is succinctly described by the equation $\\lambda x_3 = K$, where $K$ is a fixed, non-zero constant for the experiment.\n\nThese three statements define a system of linear equations for the variables $x_1, x_2,$ and $x_3$.

This implies that the dot product of any row of $A$ with any vector in the null space must be zero.\n\nWe are given the first row $r_1 = [1, -k, k^2, 0]$ and the null space vectors $\\mathbf{v}_1 = [k, 1, 1, 0]^T$ and $\\mathbf{v}_2 = [0, -k, 1, 1]^T$.

Since $A$ is in row-reduced echelon form (RREF) and its first row $r_1$ has a leading 1 in the first column, the entry below this pivot in the second row must be zero. So, $a_1 = 0$.\n\nNext, we use the null space conditions for the second row:\n1. $r_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_1 = 0 \\implies [0, a_2, a_3, a_4] \\cdot [0, 1, 1, 0]^T = a_2 + a_3 = 0 \\implies a_2 = -a_3$.\n2. $r_2 \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_2 = 0 \\implies [0, a_2, a_3, a_4] \\cdot [0, 0, 1, 1]^T = a_3 + a_4 = 0 \\implies a_4 = -a_3$.\nSo, the second row has the form $r_2 = [0, -a_3, a_3, -a_3]$.\n\nFor $A$ to be in RREF, the leading non-zero entry of $r_2$ must be 1. The first non-zero entry is $a_2$ (unless $a_3=0$, which would make $r_2$ a zero row, but the null space dimension is 2, so rank must be 2, and $r_2$ cannot be zero). The pivot column for the second row must be the second column. Therefore, $a_2 = 1$.\nFrom $a_2 = -a_3$, we get $1 = -a_3 \\implies a_3 = -1$.\nFrom $a_4 = -a_3$, we get $a_4 = -(-1) = 1$.\nSo, the second row of the coefficient matrix is $r_2 = [0, 1, -1, 1]$.\n\nFinally, we need to find the second component of the vector $\\mathbf{b}$, which we'll call $b_2$.
