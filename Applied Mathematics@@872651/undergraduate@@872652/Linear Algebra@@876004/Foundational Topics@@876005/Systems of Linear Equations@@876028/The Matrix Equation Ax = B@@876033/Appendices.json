This is a contradiction, which means the system is inconsistent. Therefore, for $c=1$, there is no solution.

The system is consistent. The rank of the coefficient matrix (and the augmented matrix) is 2, which is less than the number of variables (3). This means there is one free variable, and thus the system has infinitely many solutions. Therefore, for $c=-2$, there are infinitely many solutions. This gives us $c_{inf} = -2$.\n\nWe have found $c_{inf} = -2$ and $c_{no} = 1$.
