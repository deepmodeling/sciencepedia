That is, $A A^{-1} = A^{-1} A = I$.\n\nOne method to compute the inverse is the Gauss-Jordan elimination method. This algorithm involves augmenting the matrix $A$ with the identity matrix $I$ of the same dimension, forming the augmented matrix $[A | I]$. A sequence of elementary row operations is then applied to this augmented matrix with the goal of transforming the left side, $A$, into the identity matrix $I$. Once this is achieved, the right side of the augmented matrix will be the inverse, $A^{-1}$. The final form will be $[I | A^{-1}]$.\n\nThe elementary row operations are:\n1. Swapping two rows.\n2.
