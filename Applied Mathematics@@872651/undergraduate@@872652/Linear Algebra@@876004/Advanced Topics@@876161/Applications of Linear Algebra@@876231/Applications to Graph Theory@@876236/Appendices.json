Mastering this concept is key to understanding graph partitioning and the behavior of algorithms that operate on network data [@problem_id:1348870].", "problem": "A data scientist is analyzing the structure of a communication network within a large corporation, which has a total of $n$ employees. The network can be modeled as an undirected graph where each employee is a vertex and a direct communication link between two employees is an edge.\n\nThe analysis reveals that the corporation is strictly divided into two divisions: a Research Division with $k$ employees and a Sales Division with the remaining $m = n-k$ employees, where $k > 0$ and $m > 0$. There are communication links between employees within the Research Division and between employees within the Sales Division. However, there are absolutely no direct communication links between any employee in the Research Division and any employee in the Sales Division.\n\nThe data scientist decides to represent this network using an $n \\times n$ adjacency matrix $A$, where the entry $A_{ij}$ is 1 if there is a communication link between employee $i$ and employee $j$, and 0 otherwise. To better visualize the structure, the employees are re-labeled such that the first $k$ indices (from 1 to $k$) correspond to the employees in the Research Division, and the next $m$ indices (from $k+1$ to $n$) correspond to the employees in the Sales Division.\n\nGiven this labeling scheme, which of the following best describes the block matrix structure of the adjacency matrix $A$?\n\nLet $A_1$ be a $k \\times k$ matrix representing connections within Research, $A_2$ be an $m \\times m$ matrix representing connections within Sales, $O$ be a zero matrix of the appropriate size, and $J$ be a matrix of all ones of the appropriate size.\n\nA. $\\begin{pmatrix} A_1 & O \\\\ O & A_2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nB. $\\begin{pmatrix} O & A_1 \\\\ A_2 & O \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nC. $\\begin{pmatrix} A_1 & J \\\\ J & A_2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nD. $\\begin{pmatrix} A_1 & A_2 \\\\ O & O \\end{pmatrix}$", "solution": "We model the network as an undirected graph on $n$ vertices with adjacency matrix $A$, where $A_{ij}=1$ if employees $i$ and $j$ share a communication link and $A_{ij}=0$ otherwise. The relabeling places the Research Division as indices $1,\\ldots,k$ and the Sales Division as indices $k+1,\\ldots,n$, with $m=n-k$, $k>0$, $m>0$.\n\nPartition the index set into $R=\\{1,\\ldots,k\\}$ and $S=\\{k+1,\\ldots,n\\}$.

This practice challenges you to describe the adjacency matrix of a fully connected network, known as a complete graph.

This network structure is modeled as a simple graph where the computers are the vertices and the communication links are the edges. By convention, a computer does not form a link with itself.\n\nThe connectivity of this network is represented by a $4 \\times 4$ adjacency matrix $A$.
