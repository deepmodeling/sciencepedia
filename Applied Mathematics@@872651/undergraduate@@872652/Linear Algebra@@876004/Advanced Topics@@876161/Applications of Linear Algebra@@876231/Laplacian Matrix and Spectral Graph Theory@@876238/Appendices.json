The signs of $u$ define a bipartition; if all components of $u$ are non-zero and there are exactly two positive and three negative entries (up to a global sign), then the spectral cut separates the vertex set into two and three nodes, respectively. Moreover, $u$ minimizes the Rayleigh quotient\n$$\n\\mathcal{R}(u)=\\frac{u^{\\top}Lu}{u^{\\top}u}=\\frac{\\sum_{(i,j)\\in E}(u_{i}-u_{j})^{2}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{5}u_{i}^{2}}\n$$\nsubject to $u^{\\top}\\mathbf{1}=0$, so the sign partition tends to place adjacent vertices on the same side except across a small number of interconnecting edges.\n\nWe test each option against the condition “all Fiedler components are non-zero” and the plausibility of a $2$–$3$ sign split reflecting a sparse cut.\n\nOption A (path $P_{5}$): For a path on $n$ nodes, an orthogonal eigenbasis is given by $u_{k}(i)=\\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{k i \\pi}{n+1}\\right)$, $k=1,\\dots,n$, where $i$ indexes the vertices along the path. For $n=5$, the Fiedler vector corresponds to $k=2$, so\n$$\nu_{2}(i)=\\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{2 i \\pi}{6}\\right),\\quad i=1,\\dots,5,\n$$\nand in particular $u_{2}(3)=\\sin(\\pi)=0$. Hence the Fiedler vector has a zero component, contradicting the hypothesis that all components are non-zero. Thus A is incompatible.\n\nOption E (star $K_{1,4}$): The Laplacian spectrum of the star $K_{1,n-1}$ is $\\{0,1,\\dots,1,n\\}$ with eigenvalue $1$ of multiplicity $n-2$. The corresponding eigenspace consists of vectors with center coordinate equal to $0$ and leaf coordinates summing to $0$; explicitly, if $c$ is the center and $L$ the leaves, then $u_{c}=0$ and $\\sum_{\\ell\\in L}u_{\\ell}=0$. Therefore every Fiedler vector has a zero component, violating the given condition. Thus E is incompatible.\n\nOption B (cycle $C_{5}$): The cycle $C_{n}$ has eigenvalues $\\lambda_{k}=2-2\\cos\\!\\left(\\frac{2\\pi k}{n}\\right)$, and for $n=5$ the Fiedler eigenvalue has multiplicity $2$. A basis for the Fiedler eigenspace is given by the vectors with components $\\cos\\!\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i}{5}\\right)$ and $\\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{2\\pi i}{5}\\right)$ (after appropriate indexing of vertices). The sine choice has a zero component, but the cosine choice has no zero entries and yields exactly two of one sign and three of the other up to a global sign. Hence B is consistent with the non-zero and $2$–$3$ sign-split conditions. However, the sign partition on a $5$-cycle necessarily cuts several edges around the ring, leading to multiple inter-group edges in the minimizer of the Rayleigh quotient, which is less indicative of a single weak interconnection between two groups.\n\nOption C (complete graph $K_{5}$): The Laplacian has eigenvalues $0$ and $5$ with multiplicity $4$. Any vector $u$ satisfying $\\sum_{i=1}^{5}u_{i}=0$ is a Fiedler vector. There exist such $u$ with all $u_{i}\\neq 0$ and exactly two positive and three negative entries. Thus C is not ruled out by the stated sign pattern. Nevertheless, for $K_{5}$ any $2$–$3$ sign partition produces $2\\times 3=6$ cut edges, i.e., the cut is maximally dense, which is atypical for a situation where the Fiedler vector suggests a meaningful $2$–$3$ partition with minimal interconnection.\n\nOption D (triangle $\\{3,4,5\\}$ plus a path $\\{1,2\\}$ attached by the single edge $(2,3)$): This graph has a clear articulation via the single bridge $(2,3)$ joining two subgraphs of sizes $2$ and $3$. Minimizing the Rayleigh quotient under $u^{\\top}\\mathbf{1}=0$ places vertices within each subgraph on the same side (same sign), with opposite signs across the single bridge, thereby yielding exactly a $2$–$3$ sign split. Because the structure breaks symmetry (the triangle node $3$ has an extra neighbor $2$), there is no symmetry forcing any coordinate of $u$ to be zero, so the Fiedler vector generically has all components non-zero. Moreover, the sign partition cuts exactly one edge, consistent with a sparse interconnection between two groups.\n\nCombining these facts: A and E are incompatible with the “all non-zero” condition, while B and C, though not excluded, do not as plausibly explain a $2$–$3$ sign split driven by a minimal interconnection between two communities. Option D uniquely matches both the non-zero requirement and the natural $2$–$3$ bipartition with a single linking edge, which is the most plausible topology given the described Fiedler vector.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1371410"}]}
