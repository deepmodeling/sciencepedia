This channel is filled with a stationary solvent. A chemical precursor is dissolved in the solvent, and a photochemical reaction, induced by uniform overhead lighting, causes this precursor to convert into a fluorescent product at a constant rate. This production can be modeled as a continuous source term, $q_0$, representing the increase in concentration of the fluorescent product per unit time, uniform along the entire length of the channel. The fluorescent product molecules diffuse along the channel with a constant diffusion coefficient $D$. The ends of the channel, at positions $x=0$ and $x=L$, are connected to large reservoirs that perfectly absorb the fluorescent product, effectively maintaining its concentration at zero at these two points.\n\nAfter the system has been operating for a sufficiently long time, the concentration profile of the fluorescent product, $c(x)$, no longer changes with time and reaches a steady state.
