We can solve it using the method of separation of variables. Let's assume a solution of the form $u(x,t) = X(x)T(t)$. Substituting this into the PDE gives:\n$X(x)T'(t) = k X''(x)T(t)$\n\nDividing by $kX(x)T(t)$, we can separate the variables:\n$\\frac{T'(t)}{k T(t)} = \\frac{X''(x)}{X(x)}$\n\nSince the left side depends only on $t$ and the right side only on $x$, both must be equal to a constant, which we will call $-\\lambda$.\nThis gives two ordinary differential equations:\n1.
