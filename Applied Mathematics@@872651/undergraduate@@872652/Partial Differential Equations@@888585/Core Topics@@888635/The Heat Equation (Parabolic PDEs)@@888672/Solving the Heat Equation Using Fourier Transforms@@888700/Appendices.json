The primary method to solve this is to apply the Fourier transform to the partial differential equation (PDE), which converts it into an ordinary differential equation (ODE) that is easier to solve.\n\nStep 1: Apply the Fourier transform to the heat equation.\nWe start with the heat equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} $$\nWe take the Fourier transform of both sides with respect to the spatial variable $x$. Let $\\hat{u}(\\omega, t) = \\mathcal{F}[u(x,t)]$.\nFor the left-hand side, assuming we can interchange the order of differentiation and integration:\n$$ \\mathcal{F}\\left[\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}\\right] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\partial u(x,t)}{\\partial t} e^{-i\\omega x} \\,dx = \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} u(x,t) e^{-i\\omega x} \\,dx = \\frac{d\\hat{u}(\\omega, t)}{dt} $$\nFor the right-hand side, we use the property of Fourier transforms that deals with derivatives: $\\mathcal{F}[f^{(n)}(x)] = (i\\omega)^n \\hat{f}(\\omega)$. For the second derivative ($n=2$):\n$$ \\mathcal{F}\\left[\\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\\right] = \\alpha \\mathcal{F}\\left[\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}\\right] = \\alpha (i\\omega)^2 \\hat{u}(\\omega, t) = -\\alpha \\omega^2 \\hat{u}(\\omega, t) $$\nEquating the transformed sides, we obtain an ODE for $\\hat{u}(\\omega,t)$ where $t$ is the variable and $\\omega$ is a parameter:\n$$ \\frac{d\\hat{u}}{dt} = -\\alpha \\omega^2 \\hat{u} $$\n\nStep 2: Solve the ordinary differential equation.\nThis is a first-order linear homogeneous ODE. We can solve it by separation of variables or by recognizing its standard solution form. The solution is:\n$$ \\hat{u}(\\omega, t) = C(\\omega) \\exp(-\\alpha \\omega^2 t) $$\nThe \"constant\" of integration, $C(\\omega)$, can depend on the parameter $\\omega$. We determine $C(\\omega)$ using the initial condition at $t=0$.\n\nStep 3: Apply the initial condition.\nAt $t=0$, the solution becomes $\\hat{u}(\\omega, 0) = C(\\omega) \\exp(0) = C(\\omega)$. So, we need to find the Fourier transform of the initial temperature distribution, $u(x,0)$.\nThe initial condition is $u(x,0) = A \\cos(\\omega_0 x)$.\nTo find its Fourier transform, we first express the cosine function using Euler's formula, $\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{e^{i\\theta} + e^{-i\\theta}}{2}$:\n$$ u(x,0) = A \\left( \\frac{e^{i\\omega_0 x} + e^{-i\\omega_0 x}}{2} \\right) $$\nNow we take the Fourier transform:\n$$ \\hat{u}(\\omega, 0) = \\mathcal{F}[u(x,0)] = \\frac{A}{2} \\mathcal{F}[e^{i\\omega_0 x} + e^{-i\\omega_0 x}] = \\frac{A}{2} (\\mathcal{F}[e^{i\\omega_0 x}] + \\mathcal{F}[e^{-i\\omega_0 x}]) $$\nThe Fourier transform of a complex exponential $e^{iax}$ is related to the Dirac delta function. Using the given convention, $\\mathcal{F}[e^{iax}] = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega-a)$. Applying this property:\n$$ \\mathcal{F}[e^{i\\omega_0 x}] = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0) $$\n$$ \\mathcal{F}[e^{-i\\omega_0 x}] = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - (-\\omega_0)) = 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega + \\omega_0) $$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\hat{u}(\\omega, 0)$:\n$$ \\hat{u}(\\omega, 0) = \\frac{A}{2} [2\\pi \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0) + 2\\pi \\delta(\\omega + \\omega_0)] = A\\pi [\\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0) + \\delta(\\omega + \\omega_0)] $$\n\nStep 4: Determine the final solution for $\\hat{u}(\\omega, t)$.\nWe found that $C(\\omega) = \\hat{u}(\\omega, 0)$. Substituting this into our general solution for $\\hat{u}(\\omega, t)$:\n$$ \\hat{u}(\\omega, t) = A\\pi [\\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0) + \\delta(\\omega + \\omega_0)] \\exp(-\\alpha \\omega^2 t) $$\nThis expression can be simplified by using the property of the Dirac delta function, $f(\\omega)\\delta(\\omega-a) = f(a)\\delta(\\omega-a)$.\nApplying this property to each term in the sum:\nThe term with $\\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0)$ becomes:\n$$ \\exp(-\\alpha \\omega^2 t) \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0) = \\exp(-\\alpha \\omega_0^2 t) \\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0) $$\nThe term with $\\delta(\\omega + \\omega_0)$ becomes:\n$$ \\exp(-\\alpha \\omega^2 t) \\delta(\\omega + \\omega_0) = \\exp(-\\alpha (-\\omega_0)^2 t) \\delta(\\omega + \\omega_0) = \\exp(-\\alpha \\omega_0^2 t) \\delta(\\omega + \\omega_0) $$\nNotice that the exponential factor is the same for both terms.

Instead, the amplitude of these two frequency components decays exponentially over time, with a rate determined by the diffusivity $\\alpha$ and the square of the spatial frequency $\\omega_0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A\\pi \\exp(-\\alpha \\omega_0^2 t) (\\delta(\\omega - \\omega_0) + \\delta(\\omega + \\omega_0))}$$", "id": "2134860"}, {"introduction": "We now move to a classic and physically significant scenario: an initial Gaussian temperature distribution.
