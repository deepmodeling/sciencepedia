The $N$th partial sum is a trigonometric polynomial, hence continuous on $[-L,L]$. If the Fourier series converged uniformly on $[-L,L]$, then the limit function would necessarily be continuous on $[-L,L]$ because a uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous.\n\nFirst, $f(x)=x$ on $[-L,L]$. Its $2L$-periodic extension satisfies $f(L)=L$ and $f(-L)=-L$, so at $x=L$ (and equivalently at $x=-L$ on the circle) there is a jump discontinuity of size $2L$. Therefore the periodic extension is not continuous on the circle. Since the Fourier partial sums are continuous, they cannot converge uniformly on $[-L,L]$ to a discontinuous limit.
