This does not match the given information.\n- D: A condition at the center ($r=0$) is used to eliminate the $Y_0$ function, but it does not determine the eigenvalues $\\lambda_n$. The eigenvalues are determined by the condition at the outer boundary $r=R$.\n\nTherefore, the only physical condition that corresponds to eigenvalues being the roots of $J_0'(\\alpha) = 0$ is a perfectly insulated boundary.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2090305"}]}
