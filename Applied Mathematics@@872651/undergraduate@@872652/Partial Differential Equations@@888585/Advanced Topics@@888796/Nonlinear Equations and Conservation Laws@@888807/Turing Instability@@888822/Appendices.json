This steady state is stable to small perturbations in the absence of diffusion (i.e., when $D_u = D_v = 0$). This stability is determined by the Jacobian matrix of the reaction terms evaluated at the steady state, $J = \\begin{pmatrix} f_u  f_v \\\\ g_u  g_v \\end{pmatrix}|_{(u^*,v^*)}$, and requires that the trace and determinant of $J$ satisfy:\n1. $\\text{tr}(J) = f_u + g_v  0$\n2. $\\det(J) = f_u g_v - f_v g_u  0$\n\nTuring instability, also known as diffusion-driven instability, occurs when this stable steady state is destabilized by the introduction of diffusion.

Next choose $f_{v} g_{u}$ so that $C = \\det(J) = f_{u} g_{v} - f_{v} g_{u}$ is an arbitrarily small positive number.

Thus instability is possible, so Option C does not guarantee impossibility.\n\n- Case $D_{u}  D_{v}$ (Option D): Choose $f_{u}  0$ and $g_{v}  0$ with $0  f_{u}  |g_{v}|$, so $\\operatorname{tr}(J)  0$.

As before, choose $f_{v} g_{u}$ so that $C$ is small positive, which yields $B^{2} - 4 A C  0$ and hence $\\det(M_{s})  0$ for some $s$. Instability is thus possible, so Option D does not guarantee impossibility.\n\n- Option E ($D_{u} + D_{v} = 1$) places no restriction forbidding $D_{u} \\neq D_{v}$ and therefore reduces to one of the unequal-diffusion cases above, where instability can occur with admissible kinetics. Hence it does not guarantee impossibility.\n\nTherefore, the only diffusion condition that guarantees Turing instability is impossible, independent of the reaction kinetics that satisfy $\\operatorname{tr}(J)  0$ and $\\det(J)  0$, is $D_{u} = D_{v}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2152875"}, {"introduction": "Having established that different diffusion rates are necessary, we now examine *how* instability emerges.
