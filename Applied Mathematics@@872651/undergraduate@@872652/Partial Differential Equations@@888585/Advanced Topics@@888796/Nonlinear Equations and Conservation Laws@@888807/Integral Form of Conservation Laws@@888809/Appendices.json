The population density of the species at a position $x$ and time $t$ is given by a continuous function $u(x, t)$, defined as the number of organisms per unit length.\n\nThe microorganisms exhibit two primary behaviors: movement and reproduction/death.\n1.  **Movement**: The organisms can move along the dish. This movement is characterized by a population flux, $\\phi(x, t)$, which represents the net rate of organisms crossing the point $x$ in the positive direction. The units of flux are organisms per unit time.\n2.  **Reproduction/Death**: Locally, the population grows or declines according to a logistic model. The net source rate of organisms per unit length per unit time at any point is given by $f(u) = r u(x,t) \\left(1 - \\frac{u(x,t)}{K}\\right)$. Here, $r$ is the intrinsic growth rate constant (with units of 1/time), and $K$ is the carrying capacity of the habitat (with units of organisms/length).\n\nBased on the fundamental principle of conservation, derive an expression for the time rate of change of the total population within an arbitrary, fixed spatial interval $[x_1, x_2]$.
