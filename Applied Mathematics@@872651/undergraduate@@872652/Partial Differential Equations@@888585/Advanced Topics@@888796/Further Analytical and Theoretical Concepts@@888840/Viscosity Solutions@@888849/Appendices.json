This inequality is true for all points $z_0$ in the unit disk $\\Omega$. Thus, the supersolution property holds at all regular points.\n\n**Case 2: The singular point $z_0 = (0,0)$.**\n\nAt the origin, $u$ is not differentiable. We must use the full definition of viscosity solutions. Here, $u(0,0) = 1 - 0 = 1$.\n\n*Subsolution check at (0,0):*\nWe need to check that for *every* test function $\\phi \\in C^1(\\Omega)$ such that $u-\\phi$ has a local maximum at $(0,0)$ and $\\phi(0,0) = u(0,0) = 1$, the inequality $H(D\\phi(0,0), u(0,0)) \\le 0$ holds.\nThe condition that $u-\\phi$ has a local maximum at $(0,0)$ means $u(x,y) - \\phi(x,y) \\le u(0,0) - \\phi(0,0) = 0$ for $(x,y)$ near $(0,0)$. This means $u(x,y) \\le \\phi(x,y)$.\n$1 - \\sqrt{x^2+y^2} \\le \\phi(x,y)$.\nSince $\\phi \\in C^1$, it has a first-order Taylor expansion at $(0,0)$: $\\phi(x,y) = \\phi(0,0) + D\\phi(0,0) \\cdot (x,y) + o(|(x,y)|) = 1 + D\\phi(0,0) \\cdot (x,y) + o(\\sqrt{x^2+y^2})$.\nSubstituting this into the inequality:\n$1 - \\sqrt{x^2+y^2} \\le 1 + D\\phi(0,0) \\cdot (x,y) + o(\\sqrt{x^2+y^2})$.\n$-\\sqrt{x^2+y^2} \\le D\\phi(0,0) \\cdot (x,y) + o(\\sqrt{x^2+y^2})$.\nLet $(x,y) = (r\\cos\\theta, r\\sin\\theta)$. Let $D\\phi(0,0)=(p_1, p_2)$. The inequality becomes $-r \\le p_1 r\\cos\\theta + p_2 r\\sin\\theta + o(r)$.\nDividing by $r0$ and taking the limit as $r \\to 0^+$, we get $-1 \\le p_1 \\cos\\theta + p_2 \\sin\\theta$. This must hold for all $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi)$. The minimum value of $p_1 \\cos\\theta + p_2 \\sin\\theta$ is $-\\sqrt{p_1^2+p_2^2} = -|D\\phi(0,0)|$. So, the condition on $\\phi$ implies $-1 \\le -|D\\phi(0,0)|$, which means $|D\\phi(0,0)| \\le 1$.\nThe subsolution inequality to be verified is $H(D\\phi(0,0), u(0,0)) \\le 0$, which is $|D\\phi(0,0)| + u(0,0) - 1 \\le 0$.\n$|D\\phi(0,0)| + 1 - 1 \\le 0 \\implies |D\\phi(0,0)| \\le 0$.\nThis requires $D\\phi(0,0) = (0,0)$.\nHowever, the subsolution property requires this inequality to hold for *any* valid test function $\\phi$. We only deduced that such a $\\phi$ must satisfy $|D\\phi(0,0)| \\le 1$.\nLet's construct a test function that violates the condition. Consider $\\phi(x,y) = 1 + \\frac{1}{2}x$. This is a $C^1$ function, $\\phi(0,0)=1$.\nLet's check if $u-\\phi$ has a local max at $(0,0)$.\n$u(x,y) - \\phi(x,y) = (1-\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}) - (1+\\frac{1}{2}x) = -\\sqrt{x^2+y^2} - \\frac{1}{2}x$.\nIn polar coordinates, this is $-r - \\frac{1}{2}r\\cos\\theta = -r(1+\\frac{1}{2}\\cos\\theta)$.\nSince $-1 \\le \\cos\\theta \\le 1$, we have $1/2 \\le 1+\\frac{1}{2}\\cos\\theta \\le 3/2$. Thus, for $r0$, $-r(1+\\frac{1}{2}\\cos\\theta) \\le -r/2  0$. Since $u(0,0)-\\phi(0,0)=0$, this shows that $u-\\phi$ has a strict local maximum at $(0,0)$.\nFor this valid test function, $D\\phi(x,y) = (1/2, 0)$, so $D\\phi(0,0) = (1/2, 0)$ and $|D\\phi(0,0)| = 1/2$.\nThe subsolution inequality requires $|D\\phi(0,0)| \\le 0$, which is $1/2 \\le 0$. This is false.\nSince we found a test function for which the subsolution condition fails, $u$ is not a viscosity subsolution at the origin.\n\n*Supersolution check at (0,0):*\nWe need to check that for *every* test function $\\phi \\in C^1(\\Omega)$ such that $u-\\phi$ has a local minimum at $(0,0)$ and $\\phi(0,0) = u(0,0) = 1$, the inequality $H(D\\phi(0,0), u(0,0)) \\ge 0$ holds.\nThe condition $u-\\phi$ having a local minimum at $(0,0)$ means $u(x,y) \\ge \\phi(x,y)$ for $(x,y)$ near $(0,0)$.\n$1 - \\sqrt{x^2+y^2} \\ge \\phi(x,y)$.\nLet's analyze $g(t) = \\phi(t v)$ and $h(t) = u(t v) = 1 - |t|$ for any unit vector $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ and scalar $t$. For $u-\\phi$ to have a local min at the origin, we must have $h(t) \\ge g(t)$ for $t$ near 0.\nSince $\\phi$ is $C^1$, $g$ is a $C^1$ function of $t$. So $g(t) = g(0) + g'(0)t + o(t) = 1 + (D\\phi(0)\\cdot v)t + o(t)$.\nThe condition $h(t) \\ge g(t)$ implies $1-|t| \\ge 1 + (D\\phi(0)\\cdot v)t + o(t)$.\nFor $t0$ small: $-t \\ge (D\\phi(0)\\cdot v)t + o(t) \\implies -1 \\ge D\\phi(0)\\cdot v$.\nFor $t0$ small: $t \\ge (D\\phi(0)\\cdot v)t + o(t)$. Dividing by $t0$ flips the inequality: $1 \\le D\\phi(0)\\cdot v$.\nSo, such a test function $\\phi$ must satisfy both $D\\phi(0)\\cdot v \\ge 1$ and $D\\phi(0)\\cdot v \\le -1$ for any unit vector $v$. This is a contradiction.\nTherefore, the set of test functions $\\phi$ that touch $u$ from below at the origin is empty. The condition for a supersolution is an implication: \"IF $\\phi$ is a valid test function, THEN the inequality holds\". Since there are no such functions $\\phi$, the condition is vacuously true.\nSo, $u$ satisfies the viscosity supersolution condition at the origin.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The function $u$ satisfies the supersolution condition at all points in $\\Omega$ (both regular and singular).\n- The function $u$ fails the subsolution condition at all points in $\\Omega$.\n- Therefore, $u$ is a viscosity supersolution, but not a viscosity subsolution.
