Therefore, the most fundamental reason the proposed wave function is unacceptable is that it fails the boundary conditions at $x=0$ and $x=L$.\n\nTo assess the alternative options and confirm which is most fundamental, substitute $\\psi(x)=C$ into the differential equation in the interior: since $\\frac{d^{2}\\psi}{dx^{2}}=0$, one obtains\n$$0=E\\,\\psi(x)=E\\,C.$$\nWith $C\\neq 0$, this implies $E=0$, which is a finite energy. Thus, statement A is false because the function does satisfy the differential equation for the finite value $E=0$ (even though it fails the boundary conditions and so is not an eigenstate of the well). Statement B is false because the constant function over a finite interval is normalizable: $\\int_{0}^{L}|\\psi|^{2}\\,dx=|C|^{2}L\\infty$, and choosing $C=L^{-1/2}$ normalizes it. Statement D is false because, in the interior where the derivative vanishes, the formal expectation value $\\langle p\\rangle=\\int_{0}^{L}\\psi^{*}(-i\\hbar\\,\\partial_{x})\\psi\\,dx$ evaluates to zero, not to a non-zero value, and in any case this is not the fundamental admissibility criterion. Statement E appeals to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle to argue $E\\neq 0$ for a confined particle, but this is secondary; the essential and immediate obstruction is the failure to satisfy the boundary conditions imposed by the infinite walls.\n\nHence, the most fundamental reason is the boundary-condition violation at $x=0$ and $x=L$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2150269"}, {"introduction": "Once we have a physically valid wavefunction, such as the ground state of a particle in a box, we can use it to calculate the expected outcomes of measurements.
