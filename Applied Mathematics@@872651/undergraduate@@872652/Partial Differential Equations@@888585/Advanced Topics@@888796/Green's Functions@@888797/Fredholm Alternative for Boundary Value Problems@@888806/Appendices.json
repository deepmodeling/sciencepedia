Let the linear differential operator be $L[y] = y''(x) + 4y(x)$ and the forcing function be $f(x) = x^2 + \\beta \\cos(2x)$. The BVP can be written as $L[y] = f(x)$ with periodic boundary conditions on $[-\\pi, \\pi]$.\n\nFirst, we must find the null space (or kernel) of the operator $L$ under the given boundary conditions. This involves solving the homogeneous equation $L[y] = 0$:\n$$ y''(x) + 4y(x) = 0 $$\nThe characteristic equation is $r^2 + 4 = 0$, which has roots $r = \\pm 2i$. The general solution to the homogeneous equation is:\n$$ y_h(x) = c_1 \\cos(2x) + c_2 \\sin(2x) $$\nwhere $c_1$ and $c_2$ are arbitrary constants. We must check if these solutions satisfy the periodic boundary conditions.\nFor $y_h(x)$, we have $y_h(\\pi) = c_1 \\cos(2\\pi) + c_2 \\sin(2\\pi) = c_1$ and $y_h(-\\pi) = c_1 \\cos(-2\\pi) + c_2 \\sin(-2\\pi) = c_1$.

So, $y_h'(-\\pi) = y_h'(\\pi)$.\nSince the functions $\\cos(2x)$ and $\\sin(2x)$ satisfy the periodic boundary conditions, they form a basis for the null space of the operator $L$ for this BVP.

The Fredholm Alternative theorem for self-adjoint operators states that the non-homogeneous equation $L[y] = f(x)$ has a solution if and only if the forcing function $f(x)$ is orthogonal to every function in the null space of $L$.\nOrthogonality is defined with respect to the standard L2 inner product on $[-\\pi, \\pi]$: $\\langle g, h \\rangle = \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} g(x)h(x) dx$.\n\nWe must impose two orthogonality conditions:\n1. $\\langle f, v_1 \\rangle = \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} f(x) \\cos(2x) dx = 0$\n2. $\\langle f, v_2 \\rangle = \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} f(x) \\sin(2x) dx = 0$\n\nLet's check the second condition first:\n$$ \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} (x^2 + \\beta \\cos(2x)) \\sin(2x) dx = \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} x^2 \\sin(2x) dx + \\beta \\int_{-\\pi}^{\\pi} \\cos(2x) \\sin(2x) dx = 0 $$\nThe function $x^2 \\sin(2x)$ is an odd function (since $x^2$ is even and $\\sin(2x)$ is odd). The integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval $[-\\pi, \\pi]$ is zero. The function $\\cos(2x) \\sin(2x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(4x)$ is also an odd function, so its integral over $[-\\pi, \\pi]$ is also zero.
