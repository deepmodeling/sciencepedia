We seek curves in the $(x,t)$ plane along which the PDE simplifies to an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Let's parameterize a characteristic curve by a parameter $s$, such that $x = x(s)$ and $t = t(s)$. The total derivative of the solution $u(x(s), t(s))$ with respect to $s$ is given by the chain rule:\n$$ \\frac{du}{ds} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} \\frac{dx}{ds} + \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} \\frac{dt}{ds} $$\nComparing this to the given PDE, we can define the characteristic curves by setting:\n$$ \\frac{dt}{ds} = 1 $$\n$$ \\frac{dx}{ds} = c $$\nWith this choice, the expression for $\\frac{du}{ds}$ becomes:\n$$ \\frac{du}{ds} = c \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} $$\nThis is exactly the left-hand side of the PDE. Therefore, along these characteristic curves, the PDE becomes the following simple ODE:\n$$ \\frac{du}{ds} = 0 $$\nNow, we solve this system of ODEs.\nFrom $\\frac{dt}{ds} = 1$, we can integrate to find $t(s) = s + k_1$. We can set the constant of integration $k_1=0$ without loss of generality by choosing $s=0$ when $t=0$. Thus, $t(s) = s$.\n\nFrom $\\frac{dx}{ds} = c$, we integrate to find $x(s) = cs + k_2$. Let's denote the initial position of the characteristic curve at $s=0$ (which corresponds to $t=0$) as $x_0$. Then $x(0) = c(0) + k_2 = x_0$, so $k_2 = x_0$. The equation for the characteristic curve is $x(s) = cs + x_0$. Substituting $s=t$, we get $x(t) = ct + x_0$. This can be rearranged to show that the quantity $x - ct = x_0$ is constant along a characteristic curve.\n\nFrom $\\frac{du}{ds} = 0$, we integrate to find that $u(s)$ is a constant. This means the value of the solution $u$ does not change along a characteristic curve. So, the value of $u$ at any point $(x, t)$ on a characteristic is the same as its value at the starting point of that characteristic on the $t=0$ axis, which is $(x_0, 0)$.\n$$ u(x, t) = u(x_0, 0) $$\nWe are given the initial condition $u(x, 0) = f(x) = C_0 \\cos^2(\\alpha x)$. Therefore, $u(x_0, 0) = f(x_0) = C_0 \\cos^2(\\alpha x_0)$.\nSubstituting $x_0 = x - ct$, we obtain the general solution for $u(x,t)$:\n$$ u(x, t) = f(x - ct) = C_0 \\cos^2(\\alpha (x - ct)) $$\nWe need to find the concentration at $x = 5.00 \\text{ m}$ and $t = 1.00 \\text{ s}$.

The PDE implies that the directional derivative of $C$ in the direction of the vector $\\langle v, 1 \\rangle$ in the $(x,t)$-plane is zero. This means that the solution $C(x,t)$ is constant along curves, called characteristic curves, that have a slope $\\frac{dx}{dt} = v$.\n\nLet's parameterize a characteristic curve by time $t$, so its position is $x(t)$. Along this curve, the concentration is $C(x(t), t)$.

Integrating with respect to $t$ yields:\n$$\nx(t) = vt + k\n$$\nwhere $k$ is a constant of integration. Each value of $k$ corresponds to a specific characteristic line. We can determine the value of $k$ by specifying a point $(x_0, 0)$ that the line passes through at $t=0$. Substituting this gives $x(0) = v(0) + k$, so $k = x_0$. Thus, the characteristic line passing through $(x_0, 0)$ is given by $x = vt + x_0$.\n\nThis means the value of the solution $C(x,t)$ at any point $(x,t)$ is determined by the value of the initial condition at the point $x_0$ from which the characteristic originated at $t=0$. From the characteristic equation $x = vt + x_0$, we can solve for the initial position $x_0$:\n$$\nx_0 = x - vt\n$$\nSince the concentration $C$ is constant along the characteristic passing through $(x,t)$ and $(x_0,0)$, we have:\n$$\nC(x,t) = C(x_0, 0) = C(x - vt, 0)\n$$\nNow we use the given initial condition. The initial condition can be written using the Heaviside step function $H(z)$ (defined as $H(z)=1$ for $z \\ge 0$ and $H(z)=0$ for $z0$).
