This problem highlights how a solid grasp of definitions is often the first and most crucial step in either proving or disproving an existential claim [@problem_id:1369010].", "problem": "In number theory and computer science, the floor and ceiling functions are fundamental tools. For any real number $x$, the floor of $x$, denoted by $\\lfloor x \\rfloor$, is the greatest integer that is less than or equal to $x$.

This implies, for all real $x$, the inequalities $\\lfloor x \\rfloor \\leq x \\leq \\lceil x \\rceil$.\n\nFirst, consider $x$ an integer. Let $x=n$ with $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.

Evaluating the options: A is false because non-integers do not satisfy the equality; B is true since only integers satisfy it; C is false because integers give equality, not strict inequality; D is irrelevant to integers and thus does not negate existence; E is false because all integers, not only $0$, satisfy it.
