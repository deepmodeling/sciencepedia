This code grants a user access to content based on the state of two boolean flags: `p`, which is true if the user has an active subscription, and `q`, which is true if the user is accessing the content from a geographically licensed region.\n\nThe current logic for granting access is given by the expression:\n$$(p \\land q) \\lor (\\neg p \\land \\neg q)$$\n\nThe engineer wants to replace this verbose expression with a single, more standard logical operation that has identical behavior. Your task is to identify which of the following logical expressions is equivalent to the original DRM logic.

First, let's analyze the original expression: $(p \\land q) \\lor (\\neg p \\land \\neg q)$. We evaluate this expression for all possible truth values of the propositional variables $p$ and $q$.\n\nThe four possible combinations of truth values for $p$ and $q$ are:\n1.  $p$ is True (T), $q$ is True (T)\n2.  $p$ is True (T), $q$ is False (F)\n3.  $p$ is False (F), $q$ is True (T)\n4.  $p$ is False (F), $q$ is False (F)\n\nLet's evaluate the original expression for each case:\nCase 1: $p=T, q=T$. The expression is $(T \\land T) \\lor (\\neg T \\land \\neg T) = T \\lor (F \\land F) = T \\lor F = T$.\nCase 2: $p=T, q=F$. The expression is $(T \\land F) \\lor (\\neg T \\land \\neg F) = F \\lor (F \\land T) = F \\lor F = F$.\nCase 3: $p=F, q=T$. The expression is $(F \\land T) \\lor (\\neg F \\land \\neg T) = F \\lor (T \\land F) = F \\lor F = F$.\nCase 4: $p=F, q=F$. The expression is $(F \\land F) \\lor (\\neg F \\land \\neg F) = F \\lor (T \\land T) = F \\lor T = T$.\n\nSo, the truth table for the original expression $(p \\land q) \\lor (\\neg p \\land \\neg q)$ yields the sequence of truth values (T, F, F, T) for the four cases listed above. This pattern of truth values is characteristic of the biconditional operator, $p \\leftrightarrow q$, which is true if and only if $p$ and $q$ have the same truth value.\n\nNow, we will evaluate each of the given options to find which one produces the same sequence of truth values (T, F, F, T).\n\nA. $p \\rightarrow q$ (implication):\n- Case 1 ($p=T, q=T$): $T \\rightarrow T = T$.\n- Case 2 ($p=T, q=F$): $T \\rightarrow F = F$.\n- Case 3 ($p=F, q=T$): $F \\rightarrow T = T$.\n- Case 4 ($p=F, q=F$): $F \\rightarrow F = T$.\nThe truth sequence is (T, F, T, T). This is not equivalent.\n\nB. $\\neg (p \\oplus q)$ (negation of Exclusive OR, also known as XNOR):\nFirst, let's find the truth values for $p \\oplus q$. The XOR operation is true only when $p$ and $q$ have different truth values.\n- Case 1 ($p=T, q=T$): $T \\oplus T = F$.\n- Case 2 ($p=T, q=F$): $T \\oplus F = T$.\n- Case 3 ($p=F, q=T$): $F \\oplus T = T$.\n- Case 4 ($p=F, q=F$): $F \\oplus F = F$.\nThe truth sequence for $p \\oplus q$ is (F, T, T, F).\nNow we negate this sequence for $\\neg(p \\oplus q)$:\n- $\\neg F = T$\n- $\\neg T = F$\n- $\\neg T = F$\n- $\\neg F = T$\nThe truth sequence for $\\neg (p \\oplus q)$ is (T, F, F, T). This matches the original expression.\n\nC. $p \\land (\\neg p \\lor q)$:\nUsing the distributive law, this is $(p \\land \\neg p) \\lor (p \\land q)$. Since $p \\land \\neg p$ is always false (a contradiction), the expression simplifies to $F \\lor (p \\land q)$, which is just $p \\land q$.\n- Case 1 ($p=T, q=T$): $T \\land T = T$.\n- Case 2 ($p=T, q=F$): $T \\land F = F$.\n- Case 3 ($p=F, q=T$): $F \\land T = F$.\n- Case 4 ($p=F, q=F$): $F \\land F = F$.\nThe truth sequence is (T, F, F, F). This is not equivalent.\n\nD. $q \\rightarrow p$ (implication):\n- Case 1 ($p=T, q=T$): $T \\rightarrow T = T$.\n- Case 2 ($p=T, q=F$): $F \\rightarrow T = T$.\n- Case 3 ($p=F, q=T$): $T \\rightarrow F = F$.\n- Case 4 ($p=F, q=F$): $F \\rightarrow F = T$.\nThe truth sequence is (T, T, F, T). This is not equivalent.\n\nE. $(p \\lor q) \\land \\neg(p \\land q)$:\nThis is the definition of the Exclusive OR (XOR) operation, $p \\oplus q$.\nAs calculated for option B, the truth sequence for $p \\oplus q$ is (F, T, T, F). This is not equivalent.\n\nBy comparing the truth tables, we find that only option B, $\\neg (p \\oplus q)$, is logically equivalent to the original expression $(p \\land q) \\lor (\\neg p \\land \\neg q)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1351517"}, {"introduction": "In mathematics, the phrase \"if and only if\" is a powerful tool for establishing equivalence and is fundamental to countless definitions and theorems.

If $x>0$, then $x\\cdot x>0$ because the product of two positive numbers is positive. Hence $x^2>0$. For $x\\le 0$, the antecedent is false, so the implication is true by vacuous truth. Therefore, the implication $(x>0) \\rightarrow (x^2>0)$ is true for all integers $x$.\n\nSecond implication: $(x^2>0) \\rightarrow (x>0)$. This is not true for all integers, since a counterexample exists. Let $x=-2$. Then $x^2=(-2)^2=4>0$, but $x=-2$ is not greater than $0$.
