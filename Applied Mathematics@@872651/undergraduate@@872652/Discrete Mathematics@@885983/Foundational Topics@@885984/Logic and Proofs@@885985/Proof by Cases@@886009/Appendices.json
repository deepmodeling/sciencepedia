What is the value of this integer $k$?\n\nA. 2\n\nB. 3\n\nC. 4\n\nD. 6\n\nE. 12", "solution": "The problem asks for the largest positive integer $k$ that divides $P(n) = n(n+1)(n+2)$ for all integers $n$. This value $k$ is the greatest common divisor of all possible values of $P(n)$.\n\nFirst, let's test a few small integer values for $n$ to form a hypothesis.\nFor $n=1$, $P(1) = 1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 = 6$. The divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6.\nFor $n=2$, $P(2) = 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4 = 24$. The divisors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.\nFor $n=3$, $P(3) = 3 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 5 = 60$. The divisors of 60 include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, and 60.\n\nThe set of common divisors for these examples is $\\{1, 2, 3, 6\\}$. The greatest of these is 6. This suggests that $k=6$. To confirm this, we must prove two things:\n1. $P(n)$ is always divisible by 6 for any integer $n$.\n2. There is no integer larger than 6 that always divides $P(n)$.\n\nThe second point is already established by our test case for $n=1$, where $P(1)=6$. Since 6 is not divisible by any integer larger than 6 (like 12), the largest possible guaranteed divisor cannot be greater than 6.\n\nNow we must prove the first point: that $P(n)$ is always divisible by 6. An integer is divisible by 6 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 3, since 2 and 3 are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1). We can prove these two properties separately using proof by cases.\n\n**Divisibility by 2:**\nWe consider the possible remainders of $n$ when divided by 2.\nCase 1: $n$ is even. This means $n = 2m$ for some integer $m$. Then the product is $P(n) = (2m)(2m+1)(2m+2)$. Since this expression contains the factor $2m$, it is a multiple of 2 and is therefore divisible by 2.\nCase 2: $n$ is odd. This means $n = 2m+1$ for some integer $m$. In this case, the next integer in the sequence, $n+1$, is $(2m+1)+1 = 2m+2 = 2(m+1)$, which is even. The product is $P(n) = (2m+1)(2(m+1))(2m+3)$. Since this expression contains the factor $2(m+1)$, it is a multiple of 2 and is therefore divisible by 2.\nIn any pair of consecutive integers, one must be even. The product $n(n+1)(n+2)$ contains the consecutive pair $n$ and $n+1$, so the product must be divisible by 2.\n\n**Divisibility by 3:**\nWe consider the possible remainders of $n$ when divided by 3.\nCase 1: $n$ is a multiple of 3. This means $n = 3m$ for some integer $m$. The product is $P(n) = (3m)(3m+1)(3m+2)$. This expression is clearly a multiple of 3.\nCase 2: $n$ has a remainder of 1 when divided by 3. This means $n = 3m+1$ for some integer $m$. The third integer in the sequence, $n+2$, is $(3m+1)+2 = 3m+3 = 3(m+1)$, which is a multiple of 3. The product is $P(n) = (3m+1)(3m+2)(3(m+1))$. This expression is a multiple of 3.\nCase 3: $n$ has a remainder of 2 when divided by 3. This means $n = 3m+2$ for some integer $m$. The second integer in the sequence, $n+1$, is $(3m+2)+1 = 3m+3 = 3(m+1)$, which is a multiple of 3. The product is $P(n) = (3m+2)(3(m+1))(3m+4)$. This expression is a multiple of 3.\nIn any set of three consecutive integers, one must be a multiple of 3. Therefore, the product $n(n+1)(n+2)$ must be divisible by 3.\n\nSince $P(n)$ is always divisible by 2 and always divisible by 3 for any integer $n$, it must be divisible by their least common multiple, which is $2 \\cdot 3 = 6$.\nWe have shown that $P(n)$ is always divisible by 6, and that no integer larger than 6 can be a guaranteed divisor (from the $n=1$ case). Therefore, the largest positive integer $k$ is 6.
