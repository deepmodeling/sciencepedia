Let's find two distinct pairs $(a, b)$ and $(c, d)$ in $\\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathbb{N}$ that map to the same integer.\nLet $(a, b) = (3, 1)$. Then $f((3, 1)) = 3 - 1 = 2$.\nLet $(c, d) = (4, 2)$.

Another simple counterexample is $f((3,4)) = 25$ and $f((4,3))=25$.\n\n**Option C: $f((a, b)) = 2^a 5^b$**\nThis function is injective. To prove this, we assume $f((a, b)) = f((c, d))$ for some $(a, b), (c, d) \\in \\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathbb{N}$.\nThe assumption gives the equation $2^a 5^b = 2^c 5^d$.\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic states that any integer greater than 1 has a unique prime factorization. Since $a, b, c, d \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the numbers $2^a 5^b$ and $2^c 5^d$ are integers greater than 1. The equation shows two prime factorizations of the same number. By the uniqueness of this factorization, the exponents of corresponding prime factors must be equal.\nTherefore, we must have $a = c$ and $b = d$.\nThis means the original inputs must be identical, i.e., $(a, b) = (c, d)$.\nSince $f((a, b)) = f((c, d))$ implies $(a, b) = (c, d)$, the function is injective.\n\n**Option D: $f((a, b)) = (a+b)^2 + a$**\nThis function is injective. Let's assume $f((a, b)) = f((c, d))$ for some $(a, b), (c, d) \\in \\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathbb{N}$.\nThis gives $(a+b)^2 + a = (c+d)^2 + c$.\nLet $S = a+b$ and $T = c+d$. The equation becomes $S^2 + a = T^2 + c$.\nSince $a,b,c,d \\in \\mathbb{N}$, we have $a \\ge 1, b \\ge 1$, which implies $S = a+b \\ge 2$. Also, $a = S-b \\le S-1$, so $1 \\le a \\le S-1$.

Since $S, T$ are integers, $S \\ge T+1$.\n$S^2 + a \\ge (T+1)^2 + a = T^2 + 2T + 1 + a$.\nSince $a \\ge 1$, we have $S^2+a \\ge T^2+2T+1+1 = T^2+2T+2$.\nFor the other side of the equation, the maximum possible value is when $c$ is maximized. $c \\le T-1$.\nSo, $T^2+c \\le T^2 + T - 1$.\nThus we have $S^2+a \\ge T^2+2T+2$ and $T^2+c \\le T^2+T-1$.\nSince $T \\ge 2$, $T+3 > 0$, which implies $(T^2+2T+2) > (T^2+T-1)$.\nThis means $S^2+a > T^2+c$, which contradicts our initial assumption $S^2+a = T^2+c$.\nA symmetric argument shows that $T>S$ also leads to a contradiction ($T^2+c > S^2+a$).\nTherefore, the only possibility is $S=T$.\n\nSince $S=T$, we have $a+b = c+d$.\nSubstituting $S=T$ back into $S^2+a = T^2+c$ gives $S^2+a = S^2+c$, which simplifies to $a=c$.\nFinally, substituting $a=c$ into $a+b = c+d$ gives $c+b = c+d$, which implies $b=d$.\nWe have shown that $a=c$ and $b=d$, so $(a, b) = (c, d)$. The function is injective.\n\n**Option E: $f((a, b)) = (a-b)^3$**\nThis function is not injective. The output depends on the difference $a-b$. We can find different pairs with the same difference.\nLet $(a, b) = (3, 1)$. Then $f((3, 1)) = (3-1)^3 = 2^3 = 8$.\nLet $(c, d) = (4, 2)$. Then $f((4, 2)) = (4-2)^3 = 2^3 = 8$.\nSince $(3, 1) \\neq (4, 2)$ but $f((3, 1)) = f((4, 2))$, the function is not injective.\n\nBased on the analysis, only functions C and D are injective.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{CD}$$", "id": "1376606"}, {"introduction": "Injectivity is not just a property of functions on infinite sets; it plays a crucial role in finite mathematics as well.

We can analyze the behavior of $g(y)$ by finding its derivative with respect to $y$:\n$$g'(y) = \\frac{d}{dy}(y^5 + 2y) = 5y^4 + 2$$\nSince $y^4 \\ge 0$ for all real numbers $y$, the term $5y^4$ is always non-negative. Therefore, the derivative $g'(y) = 5y^4 + 2$ is always strictly positive, specifically $g'(y) \\ge 2$ for all $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nA function with a strictly positive derivative is strictly monotonically increasing. This means that if $y_1 \\neq y_2$, then $g(y_1) \\neq g(y_2)$. Consequently, for any given value $k = x-1$, there can be at most one value of $y$ such that $g(y) = k$. This establishes the uniqueness of $y$ for any given $x$ for which a solution exists. This eliminates option D.\n\nNext, let's check for the *existence* of $y$ for every $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We need to determine the range of the function $g(y)$. We examine the limits of $g(y)$ as $y$ approaches $\\pm\\infty$:\n$$ \\lim_{y \\to \\infty} g(y) = \\lim_{y \\to \\infty} (y^5 + 2y) = \\infty $$\n$$ \\lim_{y \\to -\\infty} g(y) = \\lim_{y \\to -\\infty} (y^5 + 2y) = -\\infty $$\nSince $g(y)$ is a polynomial, it is continuous for all $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, since $g(y)$ is continuous and its values span from $-\\infty$ to $\\infty$, the range of $g(y)$ is the set of all real numbers, $\\mathbb{R}$.
