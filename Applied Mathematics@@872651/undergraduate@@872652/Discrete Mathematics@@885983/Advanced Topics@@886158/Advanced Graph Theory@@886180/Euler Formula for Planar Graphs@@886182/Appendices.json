The design consists of a network of 10 distinct connection points (vertices). The connections (edges) are laid out such that no two connections cross each other, forming a planar graph. For thermal and power-distribution reasons, the connection points are divided into two types, 'A' and 'B', and connections are only allowed between a point of Type A and a point of Type B.
