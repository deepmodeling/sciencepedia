The applicability of Ore's condition cannot be determined, as the graph is not connected.", "solution": "The goal is to determine if the given graph $G$ satisfies Ore's condition.\n\nFirst, let's state Ore's condition. For a simple graph with $n \\geq 3$ vertices, Ore's condition is met if for every pair of distinct, non-adjacent vertices $u$ and $v$, the sum of their degrees is at least $n$. That is, $\\deg(u) + \\deg(v) \\geq n$.\n\nFor the given graph $G$, the number of vertices is $n=5$. Therefore, we must check if $\\deg(u) + \\deg(v) \\geq 5$ for all pairs of non-adjacent vertices $\\{u, v\\}$.\n\nThe first step is to calculate the degree of each vertex. The degree of a vertex $v_i$, denoted $\\deg(v_i)$, is the sum of the entries in the $i$-th row (or column) of the adjacency matrix $A$.\n\n- $\\deg(v_1) = A_{11} + A_{12} + A_{13} + A_{14} + A_{15} = 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 2$\n- $\\deg(v_2) = A_{21} + A_{22} + A_{23} + A_{24} + A_{25} = 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 2$\n- $\\deg(v_3) = A_{31} + A_{32} + A_{33} + A_{34} + A_{35} = 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 3$\n- $\\deg(v_4) = A_{41} + A_{42} + A_{43} + A_{44} + A_{45} = 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3$\n- $\\deg(v_5) = A_{51} + A_{52} + A_{53} + A_{54} + A_{55} = 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 2$\n\nSo, the degrees of the vertices are $\\deg(v_1)=2$, $\\deg(v_2)=2$, $\\deg(v_3)=3$, $\\deg(v_4)=3$, and $\\deg(v_5)=2$.\n\nThe next step is to identify all pairs of non-adjacent vertices. Two vertices $v_i$ and $v_j$ are non-adjacent if the matrix entry $A_{ij} = 0$. We only need to check pairs $\\{v_i, v_j\\}$ where $i  j$.\n\n- For $v_1$: $A_{12}=0$, $A_{15}=0$. Non-adjacent pairs are $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$ and $\\{v_1, v_5\\}$.\n- For $v_2$: $A_{24}=0$. Non-adjacent pair is $\\{v_2, v_4\\}$.\n- For $v_3$: $A_{35}=0$. Non-adjacent pair is $\\{v_3, v_5\\}$.\n- For $v_4$: No new non-adjacent pairs (since we already checked pairs with $v_1, v_2, v_3$).\n- For $v_5$: No new non-adjacent pairs.\n\nThe set of non-adjacent vertex pairs is $\\{\\{v_1, v_2\\}, \\{v_1, v_5\\}, \\{v_2, v_4\\}, \\{v_3, v_5\\}\\}$.\n\nNow, we check the sum of degrees for each of these pairs to see if it is greater than or equal to $n=5$.\n\n1.  Pair $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$: $\\deg(v_1) + \\deg(v_2) = 2 + 2 = 4$.\n    Since $4  5$, this pair fails to satisfy the condition.\n\nBecause we have found at least one pair of non-adjacent vertices for which the sum of degrees is less than $n$, the graph $G$ does not satisfy Ore's condition. We do not need to check the remaining pairs, but we can do so for completeness.\n\n2.  Pair $\\{v_1, v_5\\}$: $\\deg(v_1) + \\deg(v_5) = 2 + 2 = 4$. This pair also fails.\n3.  Pair $\\{v_2, v_4\\}$: $\\deg(v_2) + \\deg(v_4) = 2 + 3 = 5$. This pair satisfies the condition.\n4.  Pair $\\{v_3, v_5\\}$: $\\deg(v_3) + \\deg(v_5) = 3 + 2 = 5$. This pair also satisfies the condition.\n\nSince the condition must hold for *all* non-adjacent pairs, and it fails for $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$ and $\\{v_1, v_5\\}$, the overall conclusion is that Ore's condition is not satisfied.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. This is incorrect. The condition must hold for *all* non-adjacent pairs, not just a majority.\nB. This is correct. We found the pair $\\{v_1, v_2\\}$ (and also $\\{v_1, v_5\\}$) for which the degree sum is 4, which is less than 5.\nC. This is incorrect. While the calculation for the pair $\\{v_2, v_4\\}$ is correct, satisfying the condition for one pair is not sufficient. The \"for all\" quantifier in Ore's condition is critical.\nD. This is irrelevant to Ore's condition. The sum of degrees condition applies to specific pairs of non-adjacent vertices, not the total degree of the graph.\nE. This is incorrect. The graph is connected (e.g., $v_1-v_3-v_2-v_5-v_4$ is a path that includes all vertices), so Ore's theorem is applicable in principle.

In such a graph, any non-adjacent pair of vertices can have degrees of at most 1 each, so their degree sum is at most $1+1=2$, which is less than $n=3$. Hence Ore’s condition fails unless $G=K_{3}$, which has $\\delta(G)=2 \\ge \\frac{3}{2}$, satisfying Dirac.

The closure of a graph is obtained by iteratively adding edges between pairs of non-adjacent vertices whose degree sum is at least $n$. The Bondy-Chvátal theorem states that a graph is Hamiltonian if and only if its closure is Hamiltonian. Since $G$ is non-Hamiltonian, its closure $cl(G)$ must also be non-Hamiltonian.\n\nLet's trace the closure process for our graph $G$.

The closure process will therefore add edges between all non-adjacent pairs except, possibly, for $\\{x, y\\}$.\n\nLet's call the resulting graph $G'$. In $G'$, all pairs of vertices that were non-adjacent in $G$ (except for $\\{x,y\\}$) are now connected by an edge. This means that the only pair of vertices that can possibly be non-adjacent in $G'$ is $\\{x, y\\}$.

Since $cl(G)$ is a supergraph of the Hamiltonian graph $G'$, $cl(G)$ must also be Hamiltonian.\nBut this contradicts the fact that $G$ (and therefore $cl(G)$) is non-Hamiltonian.\nTherefore, such a graph cannot exist for $n > 3$.\n\nCase 2: $n = 3$.\nWe must check if a graph with the given properties can exist for $n=3$.\nLet's consider the path graph on 3 vertices, $P_3$.
