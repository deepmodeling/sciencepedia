This exercise provides a hands-on opportunity to find such a certificate, known as a \"Tutte set,\" in a tangible network structure based on a modified grid graph. By methodically searching for a vertex set $S$ that creates more odd components than its own size, you will develop a practical feel for the theorem's condition. [@problem_id:1551772]", "problem": "A research team is studying the resilience of a small communication network. The network's topology is modeled by a graph $G$. The vertices of $G$ are derived from a $3 \\times 3$ grid of nodes, which are labeled by coordinates $(i,j)$ where $i, j \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. In this grid, an edge exists between any two nodes $(i,j)$ and $(i',j')$ if and only if $|i-i'| + |j-j'| = 1$.\n\nInitially, the network comprises all 9 nodes. However, due to a localized failure, the node at position $(1,2)$ is permanently removed from the network, along with all its direct communication links. The resulting graph on the remaining 8 vertices is the graph $G$ under consideration.\n\nA key property of a network is the ability to form a \"perfect pairing\", where all nodes can be simultaneously paired up with an adjacent partner. In graph theory, this is known as a perfect matching. It has been determined that the graph $G$ does not possess a perfect matching.\n\nTo provide a formal certificate of this property using Tutte's theorem, one must find a non-empty subset of vertices $S \\subseteq V(G)$ such that the number of connected components with an odd number of vertices in the subgraph $G-S$ (the graph $G$ with vertices in $S$ removed) is strictly greater than the number of vertices in $S$.\n\nDetermine the minimum possible size of such a set $S$ for the graph $G$.", "solution": "Let $V(G)$ be the $8$ vertices of the $3 \\times 3$ grid with $(1,2)$ removed, and let $o(G-S)$ denote the number of connected components of $G-S$ with an odd number of vertices. By Tutte's theorem, since $G$ has no perfect matching, there exists a nonempty $S \\subseteq V(G)$ with $o(G-S)  |S|$. We must determine the minimum possible $|S|$ for which this can occur.\n\nLabel the remaining vertices as follows:\n- Top row: $a=(1,1)$, $b=(1,3)$.\n- Middle row: $c=(2,1)$, $d=(2,2)$, $e=(2,3)$.\n- Bottom row: $f=(3,1)$, $g=(3,2)$, $h=(3,3)$.\nAdjacencies are:\n- $a \\sim c$, $b \\sim e$,\n- $c \\sim a,d,f$, $d \\sim c,e,g$, $e \\sim b,d,h$,\n- $f \\sim c,g$, $g \\sim f,d,h$, $h \\sim e,g$.\n\nNote $G$ is bipartite with parts given by parity of $i+j$: the even part is $\\{a,b,d,f,h\\}$ of size $5$, and the odd part is $\\{c,e,g\\}$ of size $3$.\n\n1) $|S|=0$ fails. $G$ is connected on $8$ vertices, hence $o(G)=0 \\not 0$.\n\n2) $|S|=1$ fails. Check each possibility:\n- If $S=\\{c\\}$, then $a$ is isolated (odd component), and the remaining $6$ vertices induce a connected component of order $6$ (even). Thus $o(G-S)=1$.\n- If $S=\\{e\\}$, symmetrically $o(G-S)=1$.\n- If $S=\\{a\\}$ or $S=\\{b\\}$, the graph remains connected on $7$ vertices, so $o(G-S)=1$.\n- If $S=\\{d\\}$, the graph is a single path on $7$ vertices, so $o(G-S)=1$.\n- If $S=\\{f\\}$, $S=\\{g\\}$, or $S=\\{h\\}$, the graph remains connected on $7$ vertices, so $o(G-S)=1$.\nIn all cases, $o(G-S)=1 \\not 1$.\n\n3) $|S|=2$ fails. First, $|V(G-S)|=6$ is even, so $o(G-S)$ must be even. Hence to have $o(G-S)2$, we would need $o(G-S) \\geq 4$.\n\nWe show $o(G-S) \\leq 2$ for all two-vertex deletions:\n- If $S$ contains neither $c$ nor $e$, then neither leaf $a$ nor $b$ is isolated, and no vertex of degree $2$ can be isolated with only two deletions unless both its neighbors are deleted; this cannot simultaneously create enough small odd components. In all tested cases the graph remains connected or splits into at most two components, giving $o(G-S) \\leq 2$.\n- If $S$ contains exactly one of $\\{c,e\\}$, say $c$, then $a$ is isolated (one odd component), and the remaining $5$ vertices form a connected component (order $5$, odd) or possibly two components whose total number of odd components is at most $1$; thus $o(G-S) \\leq 2$.\n- If $S=\\{c,e\\}$, then $a$ and $b$ are isolated (two odd components), and the remaining induced subgraph on $\\{d,f,g,h\\}$ is connected of order $4$ (even) since $g$ is adjacent to each of $d,f,h$. Thus $o(G-S)=2$.\n\nTherefore, for $|S|=2$, $o(G-S) \\leq 2$, so $o(G-S) \\not |S|$.\n\n4) $|S|=3$ is achievable. Take $S$ to be the odd bipartition $\\{c,e,g\\}$. Then $G-S$ consists of the $5$ even vertices $\\{a,b,d,f,h\\}$, which form an independent set (no edges among them). Hence $G-S$ has $5$ isolated vertices, so\n$$\no(G-S)=5  3 = |S|.\n$$\nThus $|S|=3$ satisfies Tutte's condition and, by the above, is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the minimal possible size of such a set $S$ is $3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "1551772"}, {"introduction": "Once we can identify a structural flaw preventing a perfect matching using Tutte's theorem, the next step is to understand how to fix it.

The only edges between $S_{0}$ and $V \\setminus S_{0}$ are $(s_{1},v_{i,1})$, and there are no other edges. Therefore, in $G - S_{0}$ all edges incident to $S_{0}$ are removed, leaving exactly the nine disjoint triangles $K_{3}$ on $V_{1},\\dots,V_{9}$. Hence\n$$\no(G - S_{0}) = 9, \\quad |S_{0}| = 3,\n$$\nso the condition $o(G - S_{0}) \\le |S_{0}|$ fails for $G$.\n\nTo make $o(G' - S_{0}) \\le |S_{0}|$ hold, only edges among the vertices in $V \\setminus S_{0}$ can affect $o(G' - S_{0})$, since any edge incident to $S_{0}$ is deleted when forming $G' - S_{0}$. Adding edges within a single component of $G - S_{0}$ does not change the number of components nor their vertex counts, thus does not change $o(\\cdot)$. Therefore, only edges that connect vertices from different components of $G - S_{0}$ can change $o(\\cdot)$.\n\nWhen an added edge connects two distinct components, they merge into a single component whose number of vertices is the sum of the two. If both components are odd, then odd $+$ odd $=$ even, and the number of odd components decreases by $2$. If one is odd and the other even, odd $+$ even $=$ odd, and the number of odd components does not decrease. If both are even, even $+$ even $=$ even, and the number of odd components does not decrease. Consequently, each added edge can reduce $o(\\cdot)$ by at most $2$, and this happens only when it connects two odd components.\n\nStarting with $o(G - S_{0}) = 9$ and aiming for $o(G' - S_{0}) \\le 3$, the largest possible reduction per added edge is $2$, so if $k$ edges are added we have the lower bound\n$$\no(G' - S_{0}) \\ge 9 - 2k.\n$$\nTo ensure $o(G' - S_{0}) \\le 3$, it is necessary that\n$$\n9 - 2k \\le 3 \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad 2k \\ge 6 \\quad \\Longleftrightarrow \\quad k \\ge 3.\n$$\nThus at least $3$ edges are required.\n\nIt remains to show that $3$ edges suffice. Add one edge joining a vertex in $V_{1}$ to a vertex in $V_{2}$, one edge joining a vertex in $V_{3}$ to a vertex in $V_{4}$, and one edge joining a vertex in $V_{5}$ to a vertex in $V_{6}$.
