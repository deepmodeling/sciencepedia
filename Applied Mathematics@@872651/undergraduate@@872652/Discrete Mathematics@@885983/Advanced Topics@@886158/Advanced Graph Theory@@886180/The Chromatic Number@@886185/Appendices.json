Due to their volatile nature, certain pairs of chemicals cannot be stored in the same cabinet. The safety protocol specifies the following pairs as incompatible:\n- C1 and C2\n- C2 and C3\n- C3 and C4\n- C4 and C5\n- C5 and C6\n\nAny pair of chemicals not on this list is considered safe to store together. To minimize costs, the lab manager wants to determine the absolute minimum number of storage cabinets required to store all six chemicals according to these safety rules.\n\nWhat is this minimum number of cabinets?", "solution": "Model the constraints as a graph $G$ whose vertices are the chemicals $C_{1},C_{2},C_{3},C_{4},C_{5},C_{6}$, with an edge between two vertices if the corresponding chemicals are incompatible and thus cannot be stored in the same cabinet. The given incompatible pairs are exactly the edges of the path $C_{1}-C_{2}-C_{3}-C_{4}-C_{5}-C_{6}$, so $G$ is the path graph on six vertices.\n\nStoring chemicals in cabinets so that no incompatible pair shares a cabinet is equivalent to partitioning the vertex set into independent sets of $G$. The minimum number of such cabinets equals the chromatic number $\\chi(G)$, the least number of colors needed to properly color $G$ so that adjacent vertices receive different colors.\n\nA path graph is bipartite: its vertices can be partitioned into two independent sets according to parity of indices. Explicitly, take\n- one set $\\{C_{1},C_{3},C_{5}\\}$,\n- the other set $\\{C_{2},C_{4},C_{6}\\}$.\nAll edges of the path connect a vertex from one set to a vertex from the other, and there are no edges within either set. Therefore a $2$-coloring exists, so $\\chi(G) \\leq 2$.\n\nSince $G$ has at least one edge, $\\chi(G) \\neq 1$; with one cabinet, some adjacent incompatible pair would be placed together, which violates the constraints. Hence $\\chi(G) \\geq 2$.\n\nCombining these, $\\chi(G)=2$, so the minimum number of cabinets required is $2$. An explicit feasible assignment is: cabinet A contains $C_{1},C_{3},C_{5}$ and cabinet B contains $C_{2},C_{4},C_{6}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "1405215"}, {"introduction": "A common misconception is that the chromatic number is determined solely by the largest group of mutually conflicting items (a clique). This practice challenges that idea by presenting a network design problem where no three towers are mutually linked, yet three frequency channels are still required [@problem_id:1405216]. Solving this reveals a more subtle structural property—the presence of an odd cycle—as a fundamental reason for needing more colors, deepening your understanding of the factors that influence $\\chi(G)$.", "problem": "A company is designing a wireless communication network. The network consists of several identical transmission towers, which can be modeled as vertices in a simple graph $G$. A communication link between two towers is represented by an edge. To prevent signal interference, any two towers connected by an edge must operate on different frequency channels.\n\nThe engineering team has two specific design constraints:\n1. The network must be \"triangle-free\". This means there is no set of three distinct towers where each tower is directly linked to the other two.\n2. The network design is such that it is impossible to schedule all communications using only two frequency channels; at least three are required.\n\nGiven these constraints, what is the minimum possible number of towers required to build such a network?", "solution": "Let $G$ be a simple graph modeling the network. The requirement that adjacent towers use different frequency channels is exactly graph coloring; the minimum number of channels needed is the chromatic number $\\chi(G)$. The constraints translate to:\n- Triangle-free: $G$ has no $K_{3}$ subgraph.\n- Not 2-colorable: $\\chi(G) \\ge 3$.\n\nA fundamental theorem in graph theory states that a graph is bipartite if and only if it contains no odd cycle. Equivalently, $G$ is not 2-colorable if and only if $G$ contains an odd cycle $C_{2k+1}$ for some integer $k \\ge 1$. Since $G$ is triangle-free, it cannot contain $C_{3}$; hence any odd cycle in $G$ must have length at least $5$. Therefore, any such $G$ must contain a cycle $C_{2k+1}$ with $2k+1 \\ge 5$, which implies that $|V(G)| \\ge 5$. This gives the lower bound that at least $5$ vertices (towers) are necessary.\n\nTo show that $5$ suffices, consider the cycle graph $C_{5}$. It is triangle-free because its shortest cycle has length $5$, so it contains no $K_{3}$. Moreover, for cycles, one has $\\chi(C_{n})=2$ when $n$ is even and $\\chi(C_{n})=3$ when $n$ is odd. In particular, $\\chi(C_{5})=3$, so $C_{5}$ is not 2-colorable and requires exactly $3$ colors. Thus the constraints are satisfied with $5$ vertices.\n\nCombining the lower bound and the explicit example, the minimum possible number of towers is $5$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5}$$", "id": "1405216"}, {"introduction": "Beyond simply finding the minimum number of colors, we can ask a more general question: in how many ways can we properly color a graph using a set of $k$ available colors? The answer is given by the chromatic polynomial, a key object in algebraic graph theory.

A \"coloring\" of this network with $k$ different frequencies (colors) involves assigning a frequency to each node such that no two directly linked nodes share the same frequency. This is known as a proper k-coloring. The number of distinct proper k-colorings for a given graph $G$ and an integer $k \\ge 0$ is given by a polynomial in $k$, known as the chromatic polynomial, denoted $P(G, k)$.\n\nThe network architecture in an office building consists of two separate triangular local area networks. Each triangular network is modeled as a complete graph on three vertices, $K_3$. To connect these two networks, a single, specific node from the first network is also designated as a node within the second network, effectively merging the two networks at that single shared node. The resulting graph $G$ has 5 vertices and 6 edges.\n\nDetermine the chromatic polynomial $P(G, k)$ for the resulting combined network graph $G$. Express your answer as a polynomial in the variable $k$.", "solution": "We model each triangular local network as $K_{3}$. The combined graph $G$ is formed by identifying one vertex of the first $K_{3}$ with one vertex of the second $K_{3}$, so $|V(G)|=3+3-1=5$ and $|E(G)|=3+3=6$, consistent with the description.\n\nFirst, compute the chromatic polynomial of a triangle. For $K_{3}$, a proper $k$-coloring is counted by choosing a color for the first vertex in $k$ ways, a different color for the second vertex in $k-1$ ways, and a color for the third vertex that differs from both of the first two in $k-2$ ways. Therefore,\n$$\nP(K_{3},k)=k(k-1)(k-2).\n$$\n\nWhen two graphs $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$ are glued by identifying a single vertex, the chromatic polynomial of the resulting graph satisfies\n$$\nP(G,k)=\\frac{P(G_{1},k)\\,P(G_{2},k)}{k},\n$$\nbecause in $P(G_{1},k)P(G_{2},k)$ the color of the identified vertex is chosen independently in each factor, resulting in an overcount by a factor of $k$ which must be divided out to enforce that the common vertex has the same color in both.\n\nApplying this with $G_{1}\\cong K_{3}$ and $G_{2}\\cong K_{3}$ gives\n$$\nP(G,k)=\\frac{\\big(k(k-1)(k-2)\\big)\\big(k(k-1)(k-2)\\big)}{k}\n= k\\,(k-1)^{2}(k-2)^{2}.\n$$\nTo express this as a polynomial in $k$, expand:\n$$\n(k-1)^{2}=k^{2}-2k+1,\\quad (k-2)^{2}=k^{2}-4k+4,\n$$\nso\n$$\n(k-1)^{2}(k-2)^{2}=(k^{2}-2k+1)(k^{2}-4k+4)\n= k^{4}-6k^{3}+13k^{2}-12k+4.\n$$\nMultiplying by $k$ yields\n$$\nP(G,k)=k^{5}-6k^{4}+13k^{3}-12k^{2}+4k.\n$$\nThis is the chromatic polynomial of the combined graph $G$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{k^{5}-6k^{4}+13k^{3}-12k^{2}+4k}$$", "id": "1405221"}]}
