The vertices of $C_{10}$ are labeled $v_0, v_1, \\dots, v_9$ in sequential order around the cycle. In a cycle graph $C_n$, the distance between two vertices $v_i$ and $v_j$ is defined as $\\min(|i-j|, n-|i-j|)$.

The network is modeled as a simple graph, where the data centers are the vertices and the direct, high-bandwidth communication links are the edges. For reliability and maintenance purposes, the network architecture must guarantee the existence of a Hamilton circuit, which is a closed path that visits every data center exactly once before returning to the starting data center.\n\nThe network design team uses a well-established result from graph theory known as Dirac's theorem to ensure this property. The theorem states: a simple graph with $n$ vertices, where $n \\geq 3$, is guaranteed to have a Hamilton circuit if the degree of every vertex is at least $n/2$.\n\nBased on this theorem, what is the absolute minimum number of communication links the company must install to guarantee that their network of 10 data centers has a Hamilton circuit?", "solution": "Let the network be modeled by a simple graph $G$ with $n=10$ vertices.
