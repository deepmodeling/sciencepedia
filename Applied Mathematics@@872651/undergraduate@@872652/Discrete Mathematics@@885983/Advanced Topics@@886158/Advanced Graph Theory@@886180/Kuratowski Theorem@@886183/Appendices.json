According to Kuratowski's theorem, a graph is non-planar if and only if it contains a subgraph that is a subdivision of $K_5$ or $K_{3,3}$. Let's analyze the edge and vertex counts of these two fundamental non-planar graphs and their subdivisions.\n\n1.  The complete graph $K_5$ has 5 vertices and $\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2} = 10$ edges. Any subdivision of $K_5$ is formed by replacing its edges with paths. This process adds vertices but does not change the fact that the resulting graph structure must be built upon at least 10 \"edge-paths\". Therefore, any graph containing a subdivision of $K_5$ must have at least 10 edges.\n\n2.  The complete bipartite graph $K_{3,3}$ has $3+3=6$ vertices and $3 \\times 3 = 9$ edges. Similarly, any subdivision of $K_{3,3}$ must have at least 9 edges.\n\nA non-planar graph must contain a subdivision of at least one of these two graphs. Therefore, a non-planar graph must have at least $\\min(10, 9) = 9$ edges. This establishes that the minimum possible number of edges for any non-planar graph is 9.\n\nThe problem states that our graph $G$ has 6 vertices and is non-planar with the minimum possible number of edges. We have just determined this minimum to be 9 edges. So, we know that $G$ has $|V(G)|=6$ and $|E(G)|=9$.\n\nNow, let's determine which Kuratowski subgraph must be present in $G$.\nSince $G$ is non-planar, it must contain a subdivision of $K_5$ or $K_{3,3}$.\n- Can $G$ contain a subdivision of $K_5$? No. A subdivision of $K_5$ requires at least 10 edges, but $G$ only has 9 edges.\n- Therefore, $G$ must contain a subdivision of $K_{3,3}$. Let's call this subdivision $H$.\n\nSo, $H$ is a subgraph of $G$ ($H \\subseteq G$) and $H$ is a subdivision of $K_{3,3}$. We know that any subdivision of $K_{3,3}$ must have at least 9 edges, so $|E(H)| \\ge 9$. Since $H$ is a subgraph of $G$, its number of edges cannot exceed the number of edges in $G$, so $|E(H)| \\le |E(G)| = 9$.\nCombining these two facts, we must have $|E(H)|=9$. Because $H$ is a subgraph of $G$ and they have the same number of edges, they must be the same graph, i.e., $G = H$.\n\nThis means $G$ itself is a subdivision of $K_{3,3}$ with 6 vertices and 9 edges. The original graph $K_{3,3}$ has 6 vertices and 9 edges. A non-trivial subdivision of $K_{3,3}$ would involve replacing an edge with a path of length 2 or more, which would introduce at least one new vertex, resulting in a graph with more than 6 vertices. Since $G$ has exactly 6 vertices, it must be a trivial subdivision of $K_{3,3}$. A trivial subdivision of a graph is the graph itself.\nTherefore, the graph $G$ must be isomorphic to $K_{3,3}$.\n\nNow we can evaluate the given options based on the fact that $G$ is isomorphic to $K_{3,3}$:\n- **A. $G$ contains a subdivision of $K_5$ but not a subdivision of $K_{3,3}$.** This is false. $G$ is $K_{3,3}$, so it does contain a subdivision of $K_{3,3}$ (itself). Furthermore, $G$ cannot contain a subdivision of $K_5$ as it only has 9 edges.\n\n- **B. $G$ contains a subdivision of $K_{3,3}$ but not a subdivision of $K_5$.** This is true. $G$ is $K_{3,3}$, so it is a (trivial) subdivision of $K_{3,3}$. As established, it cannot contain a subdivision of $K_5$. This statement is correct.\n\n- **C. $G$ must contain subdivisions of both $K_5$ and $K_{3,3}$.** This is false.\n\n- **D. $G$ is isomorphic to the complete graph $K_6$.** This is false. $K_6$ has $\\binom{6}{2}=15$ edges, not 9.\n\n- **E. It is impossible for such a graph $G$ to exist.** This is false, as $K_{3,3}$ is an example of such a graph.\n\nThus, the only correct statement is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1517806"}, {"introduction": "One of the best ways to solidify understanding is to build a concept from the ground up.

This theorem states that a graph is non-planar if and only if it contains a subgraph that is a subdivision of either the complete graph on 5 vertices, $K_5$, or the complete bipartite graph on 6 vertices, $K_{3,3}$.\n\nOur starting graph is $P_6$, which has $n=6$ vertices and $m=5$ edges. Let the graph formed by adding $k$ edges to $P_6$ be denoted by $G'$. The graph $G'$ will have 6 vertices and $5+k$ edges. We want to find the smallest integer $k \\ge 1$ such that $G'$ is non-planar.\n\nLet's analyze the two possibilities for non-planarity based on Kuratowski's theorem.\n\n**Case 1: Creating a subdivision of $K_5$.**\nThe graph $K_5$ has 5 vertices and $\\binom{5}{2} = 10$ edges. A subdivision of $K_5$ is a graph formed by replacing some edges of $K_5$ with paths. The number of vertices in a subdivision of $K_5$ is at least 5, and the number of edges is at least 10.\nOur graph $G'$ has 6 vertices. For $G'$ to contain a subdivision of $K_5$ as a subgraph, it must have at least 10 edges.\nSo, the number of edges in $G'$ must satisfy:\n$5 + k \\ge 10$\n$k \\ge 5$\nThis means we would need to add at least 5 edges to create a subdivision of $K_5$.\n\n**Case 2: Creating a subdivision of $K_{3,3}$.**\nThe graph $K_{3,3}$ has 6 vertices and $3 \\times 3 = 9$ edges. A subdivision of $K_{3,3}$ has at least 6 vertices and at least 9 edges.\nOur graph $G'$ has 6 vertices. If it were to contain a subdivision of $K_{3,3}$, the simplest possibility is that it contains $K_{3,3}$ itself as a subgraph, which has 6 vertices. Any other subdivision of $K_{3,3}$ would necessarily have more than 6 vertices. Therefore, to make $G'$ non-planar via a $K_{3,3}$ minor, $G'$ must contain $K_{3,3}$ as a subgraph.\nFor $G'$ to contain $K_{3,3}$ as a subgraph, it must have at least 9 edges. So, the number of edges in $G'$ must satisfy:\n$5 + k \\ge 9$\n$k \\ge 4$\nThis means we would need to add at least 4 edges to create a $K_{3,3}$ subgraph.\n\nComparing the two cases, the theoretical minimum number of edges to add is $\\min(5, 4) = 4$. Now, we need to show that it is indeed possible to make the graph non-planar by adding exactly 4 edges. We can do this by showing that we can form a $K_{3,3}$ subgraph.\n\nThe vertices of our graph are $V = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5, v_6\\}$. To form a $K_{3,3}$ graph, we need to partition these 6 vertices into two disjoint sets, $A$ and $B$, each of size 3. Let's try the partition:\n$A = \\{v_1, v_3, v_5\\}$ (the vertices with odd indices)\n$B = \\{v_2, v_4, v_6\\}$ (the vertices with even indices)\n\nIn a $K_{3,3}$ graph with this partition, every vertex in $A$ must be connected to every vertex in $B$. The full set of 9 edges required for this $K_{3,3}$ are:\n- Edges from $v_1$: $(v_1, v_2), (v_1, v_4), (v_1, v_6)$\n- Edges from $v_3$: $(v_3, v_2), (v_3, v_4), (v_3, v_6)$\n- Edges from $v_5$: $(v_5, v_2), (v_5, v_4), (v_5, v_6)$\n\nThe original edges in $P_6$ are $(v_1, v_2), (v_2, v_3), (v_3, v_4), (v_4, v_5), (v_5, v_6)$. Let's check which of the 9 required edges are already present in $P_6$:\n- $(v_1, v_2)$ is in $P_6$.\n- $(v_3, v_2)$ is in $P_6$ (same as $(v_2, v_3)$).\n- $(v_3, v_4)$ is in $P_6$.\n- $(v_5, v_4)$ is in $P_6$ (same as $(v_4, v_5)$).\n- $(v_5, v_6)$ is in $P_6$.\n\nWe see that 5 of the 9 edges required to form this specific $K_{3,3}$ are already present in $P_6$. The edges that are missing are:\n- $(v_1, v_4)$\n- $(v_1, v_6)$\n- $(v_3, v_6)$\n- $(v_5, v_2)$\n\nBy adding these 4 edges to $P_6$, the resulting graph becomes a $K_{3,3}$ graph, which is non-planar.
