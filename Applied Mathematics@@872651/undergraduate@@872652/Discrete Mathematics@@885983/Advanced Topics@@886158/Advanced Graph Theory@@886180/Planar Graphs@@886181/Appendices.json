The layout of components and their connections on the circuit board can be modeled as a connected planar graph. In this model, each primary component is a vertex, and each conductive trace between two components is an edge. The design is planar, meaning no two traces cross each other. The proposed design features 12 primary components. When laid out on the plane, the network of traces divides the board's surface into 8 distinct regions, including the unbounded region surrounding the entire circuit.
