This process adds redundancy to allow for the detection and correction of single-bit errors that may occur during wireless transmission.\n\nThe encoding scheme is defined as follows:\nA 4-bit message, represented as $(d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4)$, is embedded into a 7-bit codeword, represented as $(c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4, c_5, c_6, c_7)$.

Thus, $c_1=p_1$, $c_2=p_2$, and $c_4=p_3$.\n- Each parity bit is calculated to enforce an even parity rule over a specific set of codeword positions. The parity checks use the exclusive OR (XOR, denoted by $\\oplus$) operation, where the result of the XOR sum of the checked bits (including the parity bit itself) must be 0.\n  - $p_1 \\oplus c_3 \\oplus c_5 \\oplus c_7 = 0$\n  - $p_2 \\oplus c_3 \\oplus c_6 \\oplus c_7 = 0$\n  - $c_4 \\oplus c_5 \\oplus c_6 \\oplus c_7 = 0$\n\nA sensor transmits the 4-bit message `1011`.
