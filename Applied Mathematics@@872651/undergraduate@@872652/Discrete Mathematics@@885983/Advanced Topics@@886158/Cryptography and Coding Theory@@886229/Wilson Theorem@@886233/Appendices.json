Consider a function, let's call it the Factorial Residue function $R(n)$, defined for any positive integer $n$. The value of $R(n)$ is the remainder obtained when $(n-1)!$ is divided by $n$.\n\nA key property of interest is when an integer $n$ is \"self-referential\" under this function, meaning the output of the function is simply $n-1$. Your task is to determine the complete set of all positive integers $n$ that satisfy this self-referential condition, i.e., all $n$ for which $R(n) = n-1$.\n\nWhich of the following choices correctly describes the set of all such positive integers $n$?\n\nA.
