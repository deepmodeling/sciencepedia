Consider the following two fundamental problems in graph theory for a simple, undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is the set of edges.\n\n1.  **INDEPENDENT-SET Problem**: Given a graph $G$ and a positive integer $k$, is there a subset of vertices $S \\subseteq V$ of size at least $k$ such that for any two distinct vertices $u, v \\in S$, the edge $(u, v)$ is not in $E$? Such a set $S$ is called an independent set.\n\n2.  **CLIQUE Problem**: Given a graph $G$ and a positive integer $k$, is there a subset of vertices $C \\subseteq V$ of size at least $k$ such that for any two distinct vertices $u, v \\in C$, the edge $(u, v)$ is in $E$? Such a set $C$ is called a clique.\n\nSuppose you have access to a hypothetical, ultra-fast \"black box\" algorithm that can solve the CLIQUE problem in polynomial time. You are now tasked with solving an instance of the INDEPENDENT-SET problem for a specific graph, which we will call $G_{IS}$. The graph $G_{IS}$ has 75 vertices. Your goal is to determine if $G_{IS}$ contains an independent set of size at least 18.\n\nTo solve this, you can construct a new graph, let's call it $G'$, and pose a single question about it to your CLIQUE solver. This question will take the form of asking whether $G'$ contains a clique of a certain size.\n\nFor this problem, recall that the complement of a graph $G=(V, E)$, denoted $\\bar{G}$, is a graph with the same vertex set $V$, in which an edge $(u,v)$ exists if and only if it does not exist in $G$.\n\nWhich of the following describes the correct graph $G'$ and the correct size of the clique to query for, in order to solve the original INDEPENDENT-SET problem on $G_{IS}$?\n\nA. $G'$ is the same graph as $G_{IS}$, and you should ask for a clique of size 18.\n\nB. $G'$ is the complement of $G_{IS}$, and you should ask for a clique of size $75 - 18 = 57$.\n\nC. $G'$ is the same graph as $G_{IS}$, and you should ask for a clique of size $75 - 18 = 57$.\n\nD. $G'$ is the complement of $G_{IS}$, and you should ask for a clique of size 18.\n\nE.

We are given $|V|=75$ and $k_{IS}=18$.\n\nLet's analyze the relationship between an independent set in a graph $G$ and a clique in its complement graph $\\bar{G}$.\n\nLet $G = (V, E)$ be a graph. Its complement graph is $\\bar{G} = (V, \\bar{E})$, where $\\bar{E}$ is the set of all pairs of distinct vertices $\\{u, v\\}$ such that $\\{u, v\\} \\notin E$.\n\nBy definition, an independent set in $G$ is a subset of vertices $S \\subseteq V$ such that for every pair of distinct vertices $u, v \\in S$, the edge $(u, v)$ is **not** in $E$.\n\nBy definition, a clique in $\\bar{G}$ is a subset of vertices $C \\subseteq V$ such that for every pair of distinct vertices $u, v \\in C$, the edge $(u, v)$ **is** in $\\bar{E}$.\n\nNow, let's connect these two definitions. According to the definition of the complement graph $\\bar{G}$, an edge $(u, v)$ is in $\\bar{E}$ if and only if the edge $(u, v)$ is not in $E$.\n\nTherefore, the condition \"for every pair of distinct vertices $u, v \\in C$, the edge $(u, v)$ is in $\\bar{E}$\" (the definition of $C$ being a clique in $\\bar{G}$) is exactly equivalent to the condition \"for every pair of distinct vertices $u, v \\in C$, the edge $(u, v)$ is not in $E$\" (the definition of $C$ being an independent set in $G$).\n\nThis establishes a direct equivalence: A subset of vertices $S$ is an independent set in a graph $G$ if and only if $S$ is a clique in the complement graph $\\bar{G}$.\n\nConsequently, a graph $G$ has an independent set of size at least $k$ if and only if its complement graph $\\bar{G}$ has a clique of size at least $k$.\n\nIn our specific problem, we want to determine if the graph $G_{IS}$ has an independent set of size at least $k_{IS}=18$. Based on the reasoning above, this is equivalent to asking if the complement graph of $G_{IS}$, which we'll call $\\bar{G}_{IS}$, has a clique of size at least 18.\n\nSo, to use our CLIQUE solver, we must perform the following steps:\n1.  Construct the complement graph of $G_{IS}$. This will be our graph $G'$. So, $G' = \\bar{G}_{IS}$. The number of vertices remains 75.\n2.  Query the CLIQUE solver with the graph $G'$ and the size $k=18$. The solver will tell us if $G'$ has a clique of size at least 18.\n\nIf the solver returns TRUE, then $\\bar{G}_{IS}$ has a clique of size at least 18, which means $G_{IS}$ has an independent set of size at least 18. If it returns FALSE, then $G_{IS}$ does not.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. $G'$ is the same graph as $G_{IS}$, and you should ask for a clique of size 18. This is incorrect. It would test if $G_{IS}$ itself has a clique of size 18, not an independent set.\nB. $G'$ is the complement of $G_{IS}$, and you should ask for a clique of size $75 - 18 = 57$. This is incorrect. The size of the clique in the complement graph is the same as the size of the independent set in the original graph. The size 57 relates to the vertex cover problem, not the independent set problem in this direct manner.\nC. $G'$ is the same graph as $G_{IS}$, and you should ask for a clique of size $75 - 18 = 57$. This is incorrect for two reasons: it uses the wrong graph and the wrong size.\nD. $G'$ is the complement of $G_{IS}$, and you should ask for a clique of size 18. This is the correct procedure. The graph to query is the complement of the original, and the size parameter remains the same as the desired independent set size.\nE. It is not possible to solve the INDEPENDENT-SET problem using a solver for the CLIQUE problem.

The construction runs in polynomial time: computing $M$ is a sum over the input integers, copying $S$ to $T$ is linear in the input size, and forming $k$ is constant-time arithmetic on $M$.\n\nWhen $M$ is odd, no partition exists. In that case, there cannot exist any subset of integers summing to $M/2$ (since all subset sums are integers), so the SUBSET-SUM instance is necessarily a no-instance.

We make our first call to the oracle with the original formula $\\phi$.\n$$ \\text{Call 1: } \\text{is\\_SAT}(\\phi) $$\nIf `is_SAT}(\\phi)` returns `0`, we know the formula is unsatisfiable.

This branch of the algorithm will represent the worst-case in terms of the number of calls.\n\n**Step 2: Iteratively Determine Variable Assignments**\nNow that we know a satisfying assignment exists, we can determine the value of each variable, one by one, from $x_1$ to $x_n$.\n\nLet's start with variable $x_1$. We want to know if there is a satisfying assignment where $x_1$ is true. To test this, we create a new formula, $\\phi_1$, by conjoining $\\phi$ with the literal $x_1$.

We can commit to this assignment. We fix $x_1 = \\text{true}$ and update our working formula to $\\phi_1$. The problem is now reduced to finding a satisfying assignment for the remaining variables in the context of $\\phi_1$.\n- If `is_SAT}(\\phi_1)` returns `0`: This means there is no satisfying assignment for $\\phi$ where $x_1 = \\text{true}$. Since we know from Step 1 that $\\phi$ *is* satisfiable, it logically follows that in *every* satisfying assignment of $\\phi$, $x_1$ must be `false`. We therefore fix $x_1 = \\text{false}$ and update our working formula to $\\phi_0 = \\phi \\land \\neg x_1$. We know for certain that $\\phi_0$ is satisfiable.\n\nIn either case, a single oracle call was sufficient to determine the correct truth value for $x_1$.\n\n**Step 3: Generalization and Repetition**\nWe repeat this process for the remaining variables. For the second variable, $x_2$, we take our current working formula (which is either $\\phi_1$ or $\\phi_0$ from the previous step, let's call it $\\phi'$) and test the assignment $x_2 = \\text{true}$.

For each variable $x_i$, we perform exactly one oracle call to decide its value.\n\n**Step 4: Counting the Calls**\nLet's tally the total number of oracle calls for the worst-case scenario (which is when the formula is satisfiable):\n- One initial call to check the satisfiability of the original formula $\\phi$.\n- One call for each of the $n$ variables to determine its truth value.\n\nTotal calls = $1 \\text{ (for the initial check)} + n \\text{ (one for each variable)} = n+1$.\n\nAfter $n+1$ calls, we will have determined the truth values for all variables $x_1, \\dots, x_n$ that form a satisfying assignment.
