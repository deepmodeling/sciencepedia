The machines should produce an output from the alphabet $\\Delta = \\{0, 1\\}$. The required behavior is as follows: the machine must output a 1 if and only if the total number of 'a's encountered in the input string processed so far is a multiple of 3. Otherwise, the output must be 0. Note that zero is considered a multiple of 3.\n\nA **Moore machine** is a finite-state machine where the output is determined solely by the current state.

Let the residue of the count of $a$’s modulo $3$ be denoted by $r \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$.\n\nFirst, determine $N_{Moore}$. In a Moore machine the output depends only on the current state, and the machine must output $1$ exactly when $r=0$ and $0$ otherwise. To update $r$ correctly:\n- On input $a$, the residue must change as $r \\mapsto (r+1) \\pmod{3}$.\n- On input $b$, the residue must remain $r$.\n\nThese three distinct residues must be distinguished by the machine’s states to ensure correct future behavior, because for each pair of distinct residues $r \\neq s$, there exists a continuation (e.g., a string of $a$’s) that causes different outputs at some position; hence the corresponding states are distinguishable and cannot be merged. Therefore, a minimal Moore machine needs exactly three states, one for each residue class, so $N_{Moore}=3$. A canonical minimal Moore construction uses states $q_0,q_1,q_2$ with outputs $1,0,0$ respectively, transitions $q_i \\xrightarrow{a} q_{(i+1) \\pmod{3}}$ and $q_i \\xrightarrow{b} q_i$.\n\nSecond, determine $N_{Mealy}$. In a Mealy machine, the output at each step must indicate whether, after consuming the current input symbol, the residue of the number of $a$’s is $0 \\pmod{3}$. Consider the behavior on the unary subalphabet $\\{a\\}$: the output sequence for inputs $a^{1},a^{2},a^{3},\\dots$ must be $0,0,1,0,0,1,\\dots$ with exact period $3$. Any deterministic finite-state transducer reading an infinite string of a single symbol has ultimately periodic state (and hence output) behavior with period at most the number of states. Achieving exact period $3$ from the start requires at least three states. Hence $N_{Mealy}\\geq 3$. A three-state Mealy machine suffices by reusing the same residue classes as states $r=0,1,2$ and defining outputs on transitions as follows:\n- On input $a$ from state $r$, output $1$ if and only if $r=2$ (since then $r+1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$), otherwise output $0$, and move to $(r+1) \\pmod{3}$.\n- On input $b$ from state $r$, output $1$ if and only if $r=0$ (since $r$ stays the same), otherwise output $0$, and stay in $r$.\nThus $N_{Mealy}=3$.\n\nTherefore $N_{Moore}=N_{Mealy}$.\n\nNow compute the minimal Mealy machine’s output for the input string “ababa”. Start in state $r=0$ (zero $a$’s so far).\n- Read $a$: state $r=0 \\to 1$, output $0$ (since $1 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$).\n- Read $b$: state $r=1 \\to 1$, output $0$ (since $1 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$).\n- Read $a$: state $r=1 \\to 2$, output $0$ (since $2 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$).\n- Read $b$: state $r=2 \\to 2$, output $0$ (since $2 \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$).\n- Read $a$: state $r=2 \\to 0$, output $1$ (since $0 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{3}$).\nThus the Mealy output is the length-$5$ string “00001”.\n\nFor completeness, the Moore output for “ababa” would be the length-$6$ string “100001”, with the initial output $1$ before consuming any input, then the same residue evolution as above.\n\nCombining these results, the correct statement among the options is: $N_{Moore}=N_{Mealy}$ and the minimal Mealy output for “ababa” is “00001”, which is option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1370718"}, {"introduction": "In computational design, verifying that a machine behaves as intended is as important as designing it in the first place.

An engineer has designed a Mealy machine intended to function as an overlapping sequence detector. The machine is supposed to process a binary input string and output a `1` if and only if the three most recently received bits form the sequence `010`. For all other cases, it should output a `0`.\n\nThe machine is defined by the set of states $S = \\{S_0, S_1, S_2\\}$, the input alphabet $\\Sigma = \\{0, 1\\}$, the output alphabet $\\Gamma = \\{0, 1\\}$, and the initial state $S_0$. The machine's behavior is specified by the following transition and output table:\n\n| Current State | Input | Next State | Output |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $S_0$ | 0 | $S_1$ | 0 |\n| $S_0$ | 1 | $S_0$ | 0 |\n| $S_1$ | 0 | $S_1$ | 0 |\n| $S_1$ | 1 | $S_2$ | 0 |\n| $S_2$ | 0 | $S_0$ | 1 |\n| $S_2$ | 1 | $S_0$ | 0 |\n\nHowever, there is a flaw in this design. The machine does not always produce the correct output according to its specification. Find the binary input string of the minimum possible length for which the machine's output string differs from the correctly specified output string. The correct output for an input string $w = w_1w_2...w_k$ is an output string $z = z_1z_2...z_k$ where $z_i=1$ if $w_{i-2}w_{i-1}w_i = 010$ and $z_i=0$ otherwise. For $i < 3$, the output $z_i$ is always $0$.", "solution": "Let $w = b_{1}b_{2}\\dots b_{k}$ be the input, and let the machine output be $y_{1}y_{2}\\dots y_{k}$, while the correct output per specification is $z_{1}z_{2}\\dots z_{k}$ with $z_{i}=1$ if and only if $i\\geq 3$ and $b_{i-2}b_{i-1}b_{i}=010$, and $z_{i}=0$ otherwise (in particular $z_{1}=z_{2}=0$).\n\nWe simulate the Mealy machine with initial state $S_{0}$. Denote by $s_{i}$ the state just before reading $b_{i}$; thus $s_{1}=S_{0}$, and upon reading $b_{i}$ in state $s_{i}$ the output $y_{i}$ is produced and the machine moves to $s_{i+1}$ as specified by the table.\n\nStep 1: For $i=1$ and $i=2$, the table shows all outputs are $0$ from $S_{0}$ and $S_{1}$, and it is impossible to reach $S_{2}$ within two steps from $S_{0}$. Therefore $y_{1}=y_{2}=0=z_{1}=z_{2}$ for all inputs; no mismatch can occur at $i=1,2$.\n\nStep 2: For $i=3$, the machine outputs $1$ only on the transition $(S_2, 0) \\to S_0$ with output $1$. From $S_0$, the only way to have $s_3=S_2$ after two inputs is to read $b_1b_2=01$ (because $S_0 \\xrightarrow{0} S_1 \\xrightarrow{1} S_2$). Hence $y_3=1$ if and only if $b_1b_2b_3=010$, which matches the specification $z_3=1$ exactly in that case, and $0$ otherwise. Therefore no mismatch can occur at $i=3$.\n\nStep 3: For $i=4$, the specification has $z_{4}=1$ if and only if $b_{2}b_{3}b_{4}=010$, i.e., the input is of the form `x010`. The machine outputs $y_{4}=1$ exactly when $s_{4}=S_{2}$ and $b_{4}=0$. Compute $s_{4}$ for all length-$3$ prefixes:\n- If $b_1b_2b_3 \\in \\{\\text{`001`}, \\text{`101`}\\}$ then $s_4=S_2$; otherwise $s_4 \\in \\{S_0, S_1\\}$.\nThus $y_4=1$ occurs exactly for inputs `0010` and `1010`, which are precisely the inputs with $b_2b_3b_4=010$. For all other inputs $y_4=0$, and in those cases $z_4=0$ as well. Hence no mismatch can occur at $i=4$.\n\nStep 4: Consider $i=5$. Take $w=\\text{`01010`}$. The correct outputs are computed by sliding the window of length $3$:\n- $z_1=0$, $z_2=0$,\n- $z_3=1$ because $b_1b_2b_3=\\text{`010`}$,\n- $z_4=0$ because $b_2b_3b_4=\\text{`101`}$,\n- $z_5=1$ because $b_3b_4b_5=\\text{`010`}$.\nThus $z=00101$.\n\nSimulate the machine on $w=\\text{`01010`}$:\n- $i=1$: $s_1=S_0$, input $0$ gives $y_1=0$, $s_2=S_1$.\n- $i=2$: $s_2=S_1$, input $1$ gives $y_2=0$, $s_3=S_2$.\n- $i=3$: $s_3=S_2$, input $0$ gives $y_3=1$, $s_4=S_0$ (note the reset to $S_0$).\n- $i=4$: $s_4=S_0$, input $1$ gives $y_4=0$, $s_5=S_0$.\n- $i=5$: $s_5=S_0$, input $0$ gives $y_5=0$, $s_6=S_1$.\nThus $y=00100$.\n\nComparing, $y_5=0$ while $z_5=1$, so there is a mismatch at position $5$. By the arguments for $i\\leq 4$ above, no mismatch can occur for any shorter input. Therefore the minimum-length revealing input string is `01010`.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{01010}$$", "id": "1370700"}]}
