A key feature of this protocol is the reservation of the substring `11` as a high-priority \"attention\" signal. To prevent data from being misinterpreted as this signal, all valid data strings generated by the sensors are forbidden from containing the substring `11`.\n\nA formal model for this system is given by a Context-Free Grammar (CFG), denoted as $G$. This grammar generates the language of all valid, non-empty data strings.

For the grammar $E \\rightarrow E+E \\mid E*E \\mid \\text{id}$, a parse tree for this fixed token sequence is obtained by choosing a binary split at some operator position $o_{k}$, making it the root operator, and then recursively parsing the left substring $a_{1}\\,o_{1}\\,\\dots,\\,a_{k}$ and the right substring $a_{k+1}\\,o_{k+1}\\,\\dots,\\,a_{5}$. Because the operator tokens are fixed in position, once a split $k$ is chosen, the operator at the root is forced to be $o_{k}$; hence the number of parse trees depends only on how many ways we can fully parenthesize the five operands, not on the particular operator symbols.\n\nLet $T(m)$ be the number of parse trees for a substring with $m$ operands (and thus $m-1$ operators).
