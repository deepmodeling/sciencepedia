The machine's output depends on whether the string is strictly alternating.\n\nLet's analyze the properties a state must capture:\n1.  The initial state, representing the empty string. The problem states the empty string is alternating, so the output for this state must be $1$.\n2.  The string is alternating and the last character was a $0$. The machine needs to remember this to check if the next character is a $1$. The output for this state must be $1$.\n3.  The string is alternating and the last character was a $1$. The machine needs to remember this to check if the next character is a $0$. The output for this state must be $1$.\n4.  The alternating pattern has been broken (e.g., `00` or `11` occurred). Once the pattern is broken, it remains broken for any subsequent characters. This is a \"failure\" or \"trap\" state. The output for this state must be $0$.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can define four distinct states:\n- $S_0$: The initial state. Corresponds to the empty string. The string is alternating. Output $\\lambda(S_0) = 1$.\n- $S_A$: The state reached after processing a valid alternating string that ends in $0$. The string is alternating. Output $\\lambda(S_A) = 1$.\n- $S_B$: The state reached after processing a valid alternating string that ends in $1$. The string is alternating. Output $\\lambda(S_B) = 1$.\n- $S_F$: The failure state. Reached when the alternating pattern is broken. The string is not alternating. Output $\\lambda(S_F) = 0$.\n\nNow, let's define the transitions $\\delta(q, i)$ for each state $q$ and input $i$:\n\n- **From state $S_0$ (start state):**\n  - If the input is $0$, the new string is `0`, which is alternating and ends in $0$. We transition to $S_A$. So, $\\delta(S_0, 0) = S_A$.\n  - If the input is $1$, the new string is `1`, which is alternating and ends in $1$. We transition to $S_B$. So, $\\delta(S_0, 1) = S_B$.\n\n- **From state $S_A$ (alternating, ends in $0$):**\n  - If the input is $0$, the string now ends in `00`. The pattern is broken. We transition to the failure state, $S_F$. So, $\\delta(S_A, 0) = S_F$.\n  - If the input is $1$, the string now ends in `01`. The pattern is maintained, and the string now ends in $1$. We transition to $S_B$. So, $\\delta(S_A, 1) = S_B$.\n\n- **From state $S_B$ (alternating, ends in $1$):**\n  - If the input is $0$, the string now ends in `10`. The pattern is maintained, and the string now ends in $0$. We transition to $S_A$. So, $\\delta(S_B, 0) = S_A$.\n  - If the input is $1$, the string now ends in `11`. The pattern is broken. We transition to the failure state, $S_F$. So, $\\delta(S_B, 1) = S_F$.\n\n- **From state $S_F$ (failure state):**\n  - Once the pattern is broken, any additional input cannot fix it. The string will remain non-alternating. Therefore, the machine should stay in the failure state regardless of the input.\n  - So, $\\delta(S_F, 0) = S_F$ and $\\delta(S_F, 1) = S_F$.\n\nLet's summarize our derived machine:\n- $Q = \\{S_0, S_A, S_B, S_F\\}$\n- $q_0 = S_0$\n- Output function: $\\lambda(S_0)=1, \\lambda(S_A)=1, \\lambda(S_B)=1, \\lambda(S_F)=0$.\n- Transition function $\\delta$:\n| Present State | Input 0 | Input 1 |\n|---|---|---|\n| $S_0$ | $S_A$ | $S_B$ |\n| $S_A$ | $S_F$ | $S_B$ |\n| $S_B$ | $S_A$ | $S_F$ |\n| $S_F$ | $S_F$ | $S_F$ |\n\nNow we compare this correct design with the given options.\n\n- **Option A:** This machine has only 3 states. It merges the \"ends in 0\" and \"ends in 1\" states into a single state $S_1$. From $S_1$, any input leads to the failure state $S_2$. This is incorrect. For example, for input `01`, the path is $S_0 \\xrightarrow{0} S_1 \\xrightarrow{1} S_2$. The output for string `01` would be 0 (from state $S_2$), but `01` is alternating. So, A is incorrect.\n\n- **Option B:** This option exactly matches our derived machine in terms of states, start state, output function, and transition function. This is the correct option.\n\n- **Option C:** This machine has the correct state structure and transitions, but the output function is $\\lambda(S_0)=0$. This implies that the empty string is not alternating, which contradicts the problem statement. So, C is incorrect.\n\n- **Option D:** This machine has 3 states and no permanent failure state. If a non-alternating input is received (e.g., `0` in state $S_A$), it transitions back to the start state $S_0$. Let's test this with the string `001`. The state path is $S_0 \\xrightarrow{0} S_A \\xrightarrow{0} S_0 \\xrightarrow{1} S_B$. The machine goes through states $S_A$, $S_0$, and $S_B$ after reading the inputs. The outputs for the strings `0`, `00`, and `001` would be $\\lambda(S_A)=1$, $\\lambda(S_0)=1$, and $\\lambda(S_B)=1$. The output for `00` should be $0$, but here it is $1$. Thus, this machine does not correctly identify non-alternating strings.
