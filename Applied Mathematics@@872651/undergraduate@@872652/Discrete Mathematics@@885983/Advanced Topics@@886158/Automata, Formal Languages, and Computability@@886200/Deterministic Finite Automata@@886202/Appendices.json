Consider a language $L$ over the alphabet $\\Sigma = \\{a, b\\}$.

Each packet is a non-empty binary string. For a packet to be considered valid and processed by the controller, it must satisfy two distinct criteria simultaneously.

The integer value represented by the binary string must be divisible by 5.\n2.  The total number of '1's in the binary string must be odd.\n\nFor example, the string \"101\" represents the integer 5, and it contains two '1's. It satisfies the first criterion but not the second, so it is an invalid packet. The string \"11001\" represents the integer 25, and it contains three '1's.

The start state is $(0,E)$, and the accepting states are exactly\n$$\nF=\\{(0,O)\\}.\n$$\n\nWe show that this DFA has $10$ reachable and pairwise distinguishable states, hence the minimum number of states required is $10$.\n\nReachability of all $10$ states:\n- For any $r \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$, take the standard binary representation $x_{r}$ of $r$ (allow leading zero if needed to ensure non-empty input), then by construction the remainder after reading $x_{r}$ is $r$. The parity $\\operatorname{par}(x_{r})$ may be $E$ or $O$.\n- To independently adjust parity without changing the remainder modulo $5$, use a fixed word $y$ of length $8$ with odd parity and $\\operatorname{val}(y) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$. One explicit choice is $y=00011001$, for which $\\operatorname{val}(y)=25 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$ and $\\operatorname{par}(y)=O$. Appending $y$ toggles the parity (since it adds an odd number of $1$s) while preserving the remainder modulo $5$ because\n$$\n2^{8} \\equiv (2^{4})^{2} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5},\\quad \\operatorname{val}(y) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}.\n$$\nTherefore, for any desired $(r,p)$, read $x_{r}$ to achieve remainder $r$, and append $y$ if necessary to adjust parity to $p$. Hence every pair in $Q$ is reachable.\n\nPairwise distinguishability (Myhill–Nerode):\nLet $(r,p)$ and $(r',p')$ be two distinct states in $Q$. We produce a distinguishing suffix $s$ such that exactly one of the two extended computations is accepting.\n\nFirst, note the congruence tool: since $2^{4}=16 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$, for any $a \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$ there exists a $4$-bit word $u$ with $\\operatorname{val}(u) \\equiv a \\pmod{5}$. Consequently, for any $r$ there exists a $4$-bit word $x$ with\n$$\n\\operatorname{val}(x) \\equiv -r \\pmod{5},\n$$\nso that appending $x$ to a prefix with remainder $r$ yields final remainder $0$:\n$$\nr\\cdot 2^{4} + \\operatorname{val}(x) \\equiv r \\cdot 1 + (-r) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}.\n$$\nIf we need to adjust the parity of $x$, we may append $y$ (as above); appending $y$ preserves the remainder $0$ while toggling parity, because $2^{8} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$ and $\\operatorname{val}(y) \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5}$.\n\nNow distinguish the two cases:\n- If $r \\neq r'$, define $x$ as above with $\\operatorname{val}(x) \\equiv -r \\pmod{5}$. Let $q$ be the parity required to accept from $(r,p)$, namely $q=O$ if $p=E$ and $q=E$ if $p=O$. If $\\operatorname{par}(x)=q$, set $s=x$; otherwise set $s=xy$. From $(r,p)$, $s$ gives remainder $0$ and parity $O$, so it is accepting. From $(r',p')$, since $|s| \\equiv 4 \\pmod{8}$, we have $2^{|s|} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$ and thus the final remainder is\n$$\nr'\\cdot 2^{|s|} + \\operatorname{val}(s) \\equiv r' + \\operatorname{val}(x) \\equiv r' - r \\not\\equiv 0 \\pmod{5},\n$$\nhence it is rejecting. Therefore $(r,p)$ and $(r',p')$ are distinguishable.\n- If $r=r'$ but $p \\neq p'$, use the same $x$ with $\\operatorname{val}(x) \\equiv -r \\pmod{5}$ and choose $s$ to make the final parity match the accepting requirement from $(r,p)$ (i.e., $s=x$ or $s=xy$ to ensure $O$). Then from $(r,p)$ the string $s$ is accepting, while from $(r,p')$ it yields remainder $0$ but the wrong parity, hence it is rejecting. Thus the states are distinguishable.\n\nSince all $10$ states in $Q$ are reachable and pairwise distinguishable, the minimal DFA for $L$ has exactly $10$ states.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of states required is $10$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10}$$", "id": "1362807"}]}
