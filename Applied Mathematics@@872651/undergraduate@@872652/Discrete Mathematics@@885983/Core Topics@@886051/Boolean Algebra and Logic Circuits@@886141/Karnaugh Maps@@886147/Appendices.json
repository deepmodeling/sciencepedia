Upon review, you notice that this expression is not the minimal SOP form. Which of the following statements provides the best explanation for why Alex's result is not minimal?\n\nA. The term $BD$ is invalid because K-map groups must not contain more than two 1s unless they cover an entire row or column.\n\nB. The groups corresponding to the terms $A'B'D'$ and $AB'D'$ should have been combined into a single, larger group.\n\nC.

This covers minterms $m5\\,(0101)$, $m7\\,(0111)$, $m13\\,(1101)$, and $m15\\,(1111)$, all of which are in the given set.\n- $A'B'D'$ corresponds to $A=0$, $B=0$, $D=0$, with $C$ free, covering $m0\\,(0000)$ and $m2\\,(0010)$.\n- $AB'D'$ corresponds to $A=1$, $B=0$, $D=0$, with $C$ free, covering $m8\\,(1000)$ and $m10\\,(1010)$.\n\nThus $F_{Alex}$ indeed covers exactly the specified minterms.

Your answer should be a single Boolean expression in terms of $A, B, C, D,$ and their complements.", "solution": "The problem asks for the minimal sum-of-products (SOP) expression for a 4-variable Boolean function $F(A,B,C,D)$ that is 1 when an even number of its inputs are 1.\n\nStep 1: Identify all input combinations (minterms) for which the function F is 1.\nThe number of inputs equal to 1 can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. We are interested in the cases where this number is even, which are 0, 2, and 4.\n\nCase 1: Zero inputs are 1.\nThis corresponds to the input combination $(A,B,C,D) = (0,0,0,0)$. The minterm is $m_0$, represented by $\\overline{A}\\overline{B}\\overline{C}\\overline{D}$.\n\nCase 2: Two inputs are 1.\nThis corresponds to the combinations where exactly two variables are 1. There are $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$ such combinations:\n- $(A,B,C,D) = (0,0,1,1) \\implies m_3$: $\\overline{A}\\overline{B}CD$\n- $(A,B,C,D) = (0,1,0,1) \\implies m_5$: $\\overline{A}B\\overline{C}D$\n- $(A,B,C,D) = (0,1,1,0) \\implies m_6$: $\\overline{A}BC\\overline{D}$\n- $(A,B,C,D) = (1,0,0,1) \\implies m_9$: $A\\overline{B}\\overline{C}D$\n- $(A,B,C,D) = (1,0,1,0) \\implies m_{10}$: $A\\overline{B}C\\overline{D}$\n- $(A,B,C,D) = (1,1,0,0) \\implies m_{12}$: $AB\\overline{C}\\overline{D}$\n\nCase 3: Four inputs are 1.\nThis corresponds to the input combination $(A,B,C,D) = (1,1,1,1)$. The minterm is $m_{15}$, represented by $ABCD$.\n\nSo, the function $F$ can be expressed as the sum of these minterms:\n$F(A,B,C,D) = \\sum m(0, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15)$.\n\nStep 2: Use a Karnaugh map (K-map) to find the minimal SOP expression.\nWe will create a 4-variable K-map with variables $A,B$ for the rows and $C,D$ for the columns, using Gray code ordering (00, 01, 11, 10).\n\nThe K-map is laid out as follows, with the minterm numbers shown for reference:\nRow labels ($AB$): 00, 01, 11, 10\nColumn labels ($CD$): 00, 01, 11, 10\n\nMinterm layout:\n      CD\n   AB 00 01 11 10\n   00  $m_0$  $m_1$  $m_3$  $m_2$\n   01  $m_4$  $m_5$  $m_7$  $m_6$\n   11 $m_{12}$ $m_{13}$ $m_{15}$ $m_{14}$\n   10  $m_8$  $m_9$ $m_{11}$ $m_{10}$\n\nNow, we place a '1' in the cells corresponding to the minterms we found in Step 1: $0, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15$.\n\nThe resulting K-map is:\n      CD\n   AB 00 01 11 10\n   00  1  0  1  0\n   01  0  1  0  1\n   11  1  0  1  0\n   10  0  1  0  1\n\nStep 3: Analyze the K-map to form groups of 1s.\nTo simplify a Boolean expression using a K-map, we look for adjacent cells containing '1's that can be grouped into rectangles of size $2^k \\times 2^l$. Adjacency includes wrapping around the edges of the map.\n\nObserving the filled K-map, we see a distinct checkerboard pattern. Let's examine an arbitrary '1' in the map, for example, the one at cell $m_0$ ($AB=00, CD=00$). Its adjacent cells are $m_1$ ($AB=00, CD=01$), $m_2$ ($AB=00, CD=10$), $m_4$ ($AB=01, CD=00$), and $m_8$ ($AB=10, CD=00$ due to wrap-around). All of these adjacent cells contain a '0'.\n\nThis holds true for every '1' in the map: none of its adjacent cells (horizontally, vertically, or with wrap-around) contains a '1'.\n\nStep 4: Determine the minimal SOP expression.\nSince no two '1's are adjacent, it is impossible to form any groups of two or more. Each '1' in the map is isolated from all other '1's. In this situation, each '1' forms a prime implicant by itself. The minimal SOP expression is the sum of all these prime implicants. Each prime implicant corresponds to one of the original minterms.\n\nTherefore, the minimal SOP expression is simply the sum of all the minterms where the function is 1.\n\nStep 5: Write the final expression.\nWe write out the Boolean expression for each of the 8 minterms and sum them together:\n- $m_0 = \\overline{A}\\overline{B}\\overline{C}\\overline{D}$\n- $m_3 = \\overline{A}\\overline{B}CD$\n- $m_5 = \\overline{A}B\\overline{C}D$\n- $m_6 = \\overline{A}BC\\overline{D}$\n- $m_9 = A\\overline{B}\\overline{C}D$\n- $m_{10} = A\\overline{B}C\\overline{D}$\n- $m_{12} = AB\\overline{C}\\overline{D}$\n- $m_{15} = ABCD$\n\nThe minimal SOP expression is the sum of these terms. This function is also known as the 4-variable even parity function or the 4-input XNOR function. While it can be written more compactly as $F = \\overline{A \\oplus B \\oplus C \\oplus D}$, this is not a sum-of-products form. The expression derived from the K-map is the correct minimal SOP form.\n\nFinal Expression:\n$F(A,B,C,D) = \\overline{A}\\overline{B}\\overline{C}\\overline{D} + \\overline{A}\\overline{B}CD + \\overline{A}B\\overline{C}D + \\overline{A}BC\\overline{D} + A\\overline{B}\\overline{C}D + A\\overline{B}C\\overline{D} + AB\\overline{C}\\overline{D} + ABCD$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\overline{A}\\overline{B}\\overline{C}\\overline{D} + \\overline{A}\\overline{B}CD + \\overline{A}B\\overline{C}D + \\overline{A}BC\\overline{D} + A\\overline{B}\\overline{C}D + A\\overline{B}C\\overline{D} + AB\\overline{C}\\overline{D} + ABCD}$$", "id": "1379395"}]}
