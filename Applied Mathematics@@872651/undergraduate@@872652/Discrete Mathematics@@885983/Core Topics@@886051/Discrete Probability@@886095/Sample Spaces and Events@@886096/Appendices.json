The deck consists of 13 ranks (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace) in each of four suits (Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades). A \"hand\" consists of 5 cards dealt from this deck.\n\nA specific type of hand called a \"full house\" is formed by three cards of one rank and two cards of another, different rank. The ranks of Jack, Queen, and King are collectively known as \"face cards\".\n\nDetermine the total number of distinct 5-card hands that can be classified as a full house where the three-of-a-kind is composed of face cards.", "solution": "The problem asks for the number of ways to form a specific type of 5-card hand, which is a counting problem that can be solved using combinations and the multiplication principle. The hand must be a \"full house\" (three cards of one rank, two cards of another) with the additional constraint that the three-of-a-kind must be a face card rank (Jack, Queen, or King).\n\nLet's break down the process of constructing such a hand into a sequence of steps:\n\nStep 1: Choose the rank for the three-of-a-kind.\nThe problem specifies that this rank must be a face card. The face card ranks are Jack, Queen, and King. Therefore, there are 3 possible ranks to choose from for the three-of-a-kind. The number of ways to choose one rank from these three is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{3}{1}$.\nNumber of ways = $\\binom{3}{1} = 3$.\n\nStep 2: Choose the three cards of the selected rank.\nFor any given rank, there are 4 cards in the deck (one for each suit). To form a three-of-a-kind, we must choose 3 of these 4 cards. The number of ways to do this is $\\binom{4}{3}$.\nNumber of ways = $\\binom{4}{3} = \\frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \\frac{4!}{3!1!} = 4$.\n\nStep 3: Choose the rank for the pair.\nA full house consists of two different ranks. Since one rank has already been chosen for the three-of-a-kind, it cannot be used for the pair. There are 13 total ranks in the deck. After selecting one, 12 ranks remain available for the pair. The number of ways to choose one rank from these remaining 12 is $\\binom{12}{1}$.\nNumber of ways = $\\binom{12}{1} = 12$.\n\nStep 4: Choose the two cards of the second selected rank.\nFor the rank chosen in Step 3, there are 4 cards in the deck. To form a pair, we must choose 2 of these 4 cards. The number of ways to do this is $\\binom{4}{2}$.\nNumber of ways = $\\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2 \\times 1} = 6$.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the total number of hands.\nBy the multiplication principle, the total number of distinct hands is the product of the number of ways to complete each independent step.\n\nTotal hands = (Ways to choose the rank for the triple) $\\times$ (Ways to choose the 3 cards of that rank) $\\times$ (Ways to choose the rank for the pair) $\\times$ (Ways to choose the 2 cards of that rank)\nTotal hands = $\\binom{3}{1} \\times \\binom{4}{3} \\times \\binom{12}{1} \\times \\binom{4}{2}$\nTotal hands = $3 \\times 4 \\times 12 \\times 6$\nTotal hands = $12 \\times 72$\nTotal hands = $864$.\n\nThus, there are 864 distinct 5-card hands that meet the specified criteria.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{864}$$", "id": "1952718"}, {"introduction": "Building upon basic counting, this problem introduces logical constraints that are common in system design and network analysis.
