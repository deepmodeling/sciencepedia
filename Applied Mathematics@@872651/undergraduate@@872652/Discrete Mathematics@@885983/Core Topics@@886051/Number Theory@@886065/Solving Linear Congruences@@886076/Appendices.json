The robot starts at position 0. In each operational step, it moves exactly 12 positions forward in the clockwise direction. The robot can perform an unlimited number of steps.

Therefore $12k \\pmod{30}$ is always a multiple of $6$, so every reachable position is congruent to $0 \\pmod{6}$. Conversely, modulo $30$, the distinct multiples of $6$ are $\\{0,6,12,18,24\\}$. To see these are all reachable, reduce by $6$ to work modulo $5$: since $\\gcd(2,5)=1$, the map $k \\mapsto 2k \\pmod{5}$ is surjective, so for each $t \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$ there exists $k$ with $2k \\equiv t \\pmod{5}$, yielding $12k \\equiv 6t \\pmod{30}$.\n\nHence the reachable positions are exactly $\\{0,6,12,18,24\\}$ modulo $30$, and the unreachable positions are precisely those not divisible by $6$.
