Therefore there exists an integer $t$ such that $k(k+1)=2t$, and hence\n$$\nn^{2}-1=4\\cdot 2t=8t.\n$$\nThus every $n^{2}-1$ with $n$ odd is divisible by $8$, so $8$ is a common divisor of all non-zero elements of $S$.\n\nTo show the greatest common divisor is exactly $8$, it suffices to produce a non-zero element of $S$ that is not divisible by $16$. Taking $n=3$ (which is odd) gives\n$$\n3^{2}-1=8,\n$$\nwhich is not divisible by $16$.
