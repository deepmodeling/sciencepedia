There is $1$ isomorphism class.\n- Case $2+1+1$: one bidirectional pair and one single arc on each of the other two pairs. The only way to satisfy in-degree and out-degree at least $1$ at every vertex is with opposite orientations through the third vertex, for example $1\\leftrightarrow 2$, $1\\to 3$, $3\\to 2$. This yields strong connectivity. The other mixed orientation is isomorphic by swapping the endpoints of the bidirected pair. The aligned orientations ($1\\to 3$ and $2\\to 3$, or $3\\to 1$ and $3\\to 2$) violate the in/out-degree condition for vertex $3$ and are not strongly connected.

Each network can be modeled as a directed graph (digraph) where servers are vertices and one-way data links are directed edges. The set of servers in Network A is $V_A$ and the set in Network B is $V_B$; these two sets are disjoint. Within each individual network, it is possible to send data from any server to any other server by following a sequence of links. In graph theory terms, this means the digraph for Network A, $G_A = (V_A, E_A)$, and the digraph for Network B, $G_B = (V_B, E_B)$, are both strongly connected.

Without loss of generality, let the single added edge be $(u,v)$ with $u \\in V_A$ and $v \\in V_B$. Then there is no directed edge from $V_B$ to $V_A$. Any directed path from a vertex in $V_B$ to a vertex in $V_A$ would need to cross from $V_B$ to $V_A$ at least once, which is impossible because no edge of that orientation exists. Hence $G_{total}$ cannot be strongly connected. The same conclusion holds if the single edge is oriented from $V_B$ to $V_A$. Therefore, $k \\ge 2$ is necessary.\n\nSufficiency of two inter-network edges: Choose arbitrary vertices $a_0,a_1 \\in V_A$ and $b_0,b_1 \\in V_B$. Add the two edges $(a_0,b_0)$ and $(b_1,a_1)$. To see that $G_{total}$ is strongly connected, consider arbitrary vertices $x,y$:\n- If $x,y \\in V_A$ or $x,y \\in V_B$, the original strong connectivity of $G_A$ or $G_B$ provides a directed path between them.\n- If $x \\in V_A$ and $y \\in V_B$, since $G_A$ is strongly connected there is a directed path $x \\to a_0$, then the added edge $(a_0,b_0)$, followed by a directed path $b_0 \\to y$ in $G_B$.\n- If $x \\in V_B$ and $y \\in V_A$, since $G_B$ is strongly connected there is a directed path $x \\to b_1$, then the added edge $(b_1,a_1)$, followed by a directed path $a_1 \\to y$ in $G_A$.\n\nThus two edges, one in each direction between the vertex sets, guarantee that $G_{total}$ is strongly connected.

This problem presents a practical challenge: how to upgrade such a network to be \"fully resilient,\" or strongly connected, with minimal effort. This exercise will guide you through applying the theory of strongly connected components to solve an optimization problem, a skill directly applicable to network design and systems analysis ([@problem_id:1402286]).", "problem": "In modern cloud computing architectures, systems are often designed as a collection of independent microservices that communicate with each other. The dependency between these services can be modeled as a directed graph where an edge from service `A` to service `B` indicates that `A` can send requests to `B`. For reasons of stability and to prevent infinite loops in request chains, the initial dependency graph for a new system is configured as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).\n\nThe system consists of ten microservices, represented by the set of vertices $V = \\{v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4, v_5, v_6, v_7, v_8, v_9, v_{10}\\}$. The initial set of communication channels is represented by the set of directed edges $E = \\{(v_1, v_4), (v_2, v_4), (v_3, v_5), (v_4, v_6), (v_5, v_6), (v_6, v_7), (v_8, v_9)\\}$.\n\nA new operational requirement mandates that the entire system must be made \"fully resilient,\" which mathematically means the dependency graph must become strongly connected. A directed graph is strongly connected if for every ordered pair of vertices $(u, v)$, there is a path of directed edges from $u$ to $v$. To meet this requirement, system architects must add new communication channels (directed edges) to the graph.\n\nWhat is the minimum number of new edges that must be added to the graph $G = (V, E)$ to make it strongly connected?", "solution": "We model the microservice communication structure as the directed graph $G=(V,E)$ with $V=\\{v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_{10}\\}$ and $E=\\{(v_1, v_4), (v_2, v_4), (v_3, v_5), (v_4, v_6), (v_5, v_6), (v_6, v_7), (v_8, v_9)\\}$.

Conversely, one can always add $\\max(p,q)$ edges to connect the SCCs into a single directed cycle by appropriately linking sinks to sources (reusing some sinks or sources if necessary), so $r \\le \\max(p,q)$.\n\nApplying this to the current graph with $p=5$ and $q=3$ gives\n$$r=\\max(5,3)=5.$$\n\nFor completeness, one explicit set of $5$ added edges that achieves strong connectivity is\n$$(v_7, v_8), (v_9, v_2), (v_6, v_1), (v_8, v_{10}), (v_{10}, v_3),$$\nafter which every vertex reaches every other via directed paths.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of new edges required is $5$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5}$$", "id": "1402286"}]}
