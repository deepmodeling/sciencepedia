The degree of a vertex is the student’s contact count.\n\nFirst, note that for any simple graph on $n$ vertices, each degree $d$ satisfies $0 \\leq d \\leq n-1$. Hence here each degree is in $\\{0,1,\\dots,24\\}$.\n\nAlso, the Handshake Lemma states that the sum of all degrees equals twice the number of edges. If $m$ is the number of edges, then\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{25} d_{i} = 2m,\n$$\nwhich is always an even integer.\n\nWe analyze each statement:\n\nA. At least two students must have the exact same contact count. Proof: Degrees lie in $\\{0,1,\\dots,24\\}$, but a graph cannot simultaneously have a vertex of degree $0$ and a vertex of degree $24$. Indeed, if some vertex has degree $24$, then it is adjacent to every other vertex, so no vertex can have degree $0$. Conversely, if a vertex has degree $0$, then no vertex can have degree $24$. Therefore, at most $24$ distinct degree values can occur among $25$ students. By the pigeonhole principle, at least two students share a contact count. Hence A is guaranteed true.\n\nB. There must be at least one student with a contact count of $0$ and another student with a contact count of $24$. As shown above, these two degrees cannot occur simultaneously. Therefore B is false.\n\nC. There must be at least one student with a contact count of exactly $12$. This is not guaranteed. A counterexample is the empty graph with $m=0$, for which all degrees are $0$, so no student has degree $12$. Therefore C is false.\n\nD. The total sum of the contact counts of all $25$ students must be an odd number. By the Handshake Lemma, the sum is $2m$, which is even. Therefore D is false.\n\nE. It is possible for all $25$ students to have a different contact count. This would require realizing all $25$ values in $\\{0,1,\\dots,24\\}$, but as shown, $0$ and $24$ cannot occur together. Hence at most $24$ distinct degrees can appear, making $25$ distinct contact counts impossible.
