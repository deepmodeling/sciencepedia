This exercise, framed in the context of materials science, asks us to determine the number of ways to form a mixture from several types of atoms [@problem_id:1349433]. The core task is to count the number of non-negative integer solutions to an equation, which is the classic scenario solved by the 'stars and bars' method and forms the bedrock of this topic.", "problem": "A materials scientist is designing a new alloy by mixing different elements. For a particular sample, a total of 10 atoms must be chosen to be added as dopants to a crystal lattice. The scientist has an unlimited supply of 4 different types of dopant elements, let's call them Type 1, Type 2, Type 3, and Type 4. The properties of the resulting alloy depend only on the total count of each type of dopant atom in the sample, not on the order in which they are added or their specific positions in the lattice. How many distinct compositions of the 10-atom dopant mixture can be formed?", "solution": "Let $x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, x_{4}$ denote the counts of atoms of Type $1,2,3,4$, respectively. The problem states that the total number of atoms is fixed at $10$ and only the counts matter, so we must count the number of nonnegative integer solutions to\n$$\nx_{1}+x_{2}+x_{3}+x_{4}=10, \\quad x_{i} \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}.\n$$\nBy the stars and bars principle, the number of solutions to $x_{1}+\\cdots+x_{k}=n$ with $x_{i} \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}$ is\n$$\n\\binom{n+k-1}{k-1}.\n$$\nHere $n=10$ and $k=4$, so the number of distinct compositions is\n$$\n\\binom{10+4-1}{4-1}=\\binom{13}{3}.\n$$\nEvaluating the binomial coefficient:\n$$\n\\binom{13}{3}=\\frac{13!}{3!\\,10!}=\\frac{13 \\cdot 12 \\cdot 11}{3 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1}=286.\n$$\nTherefore, there are $286$ distinct compositions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{286}$$", "id": "1349433"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the basic model, many real-world scenarios impose minimum requirements.
