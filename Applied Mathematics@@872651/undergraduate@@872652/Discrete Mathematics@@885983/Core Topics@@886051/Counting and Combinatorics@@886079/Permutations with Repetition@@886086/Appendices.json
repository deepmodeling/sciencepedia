Two sequences are considered distinct if and only if they differ in the type of atom at one or more positions. Calculate the exact total number of such distinct sequences.", "solution": "The problem asks for the number of distinct linear sequences of the atoms in a molecule of Flexamine, which has the formula $C_8H_{12}N_4Si_2$. This is a problem of counting the number of distinguishable permutations of a multiset.\n\nFirst, we determine the total number of atoms in the molecule, which corresponds to the total number of positions in the linear sequence. Let this be $n$.\nThe counts for each type of atom are:\n- Carbon (C): $n_C = 8$\n- Hydrogen (H): $n_H = 12$\n- Nitrogen (N): $n_N = 4$\n- Silicon (Si): $n_{Si} = 2$\n\nThe total number of atoms is the sum of the counts of each element:\n$$ n = n_C + n_H + n_N + n_{Si} = 8 + 12 + 4 + 2 = 26 $$\n\nThe number of distinct permutations of $n$ objects, where there are $k$ distinct types of objects with counts $n_1, n_2, \\dots, n_k$ respectively, is given by the multinomial coefficient formula:\n$$ N = \\frac{n!}{n_1! n_2! \\cdots n_k!} $$\n\nIn our case, this translates to:\n$$ N = \\frac{26!}{8! \\cdot 12! \\cdot 4! \\cdot 2!} $$\n\nTo compute this value, we can expand the factorials and simplify. We can start by expanding the largest factorial in the numerator, $26!$, until we reach the largest factorial in the denominator, $12!$:\n$$ N = \\frac{26 \\times 25 \\times 24 \\times 23 \\times 22 \\times 21 \\times 20 \\times 19 \\times 18 \\times 17 \\times 16 \\times 15 \\times 14 \\times 13 \\times 12!}{8! \\cdot 12! \\cdot 4! \\cdot 2!} $$\n\nWe can cancel the $12!$ terms:\n$$ N = \\frac{26 \\times 25 \\times 24 \\times 23 \\times 22 \\times 21 \\times 20 \\times 19 \\times 18 \\times 17 \\times 16 \\times 15 \\times 14 \\times 13}{8! \\cdot 4! \\cdot 2!} $$\n\nNow, let's evaluate the remaining factorials in the denominator: $8! = 40,320$, $4! = 24$, and $2! = 2$.\n$8! \\cdot 4! \\cdot 2! = 40,320 \\cdot 24 \\cdot 2 = 1,935,360$.\nThe numerator is a very large number. A more practical approach is to cancel terms:\n$$ N = \\frac{26 \\times 25 \\times 24 \\times 23 \\times 22 \\times 21 \\times 20 \\times 19 \\times 18 \\times 17 \\times 16 \\times 15 \\times 14 \\times 13}{(8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1) \\cdot (24) \\cdot (2)} $$\nWe can cancel $24$ from the numerator and denominator. We can also cancel $8 \\times 2 = 16$.\n$$ N = \\frac{26 \\times 25 \\times 23 \\times 22 \\times 21 \\times 20 \\times 19 \\times 18 \\times 17 \\times 15 \\times 14 \\times 13}{8!/8 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{26 \\times 25 \\times 23 \\times 22 \\times 21 \\times 20 \\times 19 \\times 18 \\times 17 \\times 15 \\times 14 \\times 13}{7! \\cdot 2} $$\nLet's perform the calculation using a computational tool or careful simplification:\n$N = 26 \\times 25 \\times 23 \\times 22 \\times 21 \\times 19 \\times 17 \\times 15 \\times 13 = 435,031,096,500$.\n\nThe total number of distinct linear sequences is 435,031,096,500.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{435031096500}$$", "id": "1391257"}, {"introduction": "Real-world problems often come with specific conditions that add a layer of complexity.
