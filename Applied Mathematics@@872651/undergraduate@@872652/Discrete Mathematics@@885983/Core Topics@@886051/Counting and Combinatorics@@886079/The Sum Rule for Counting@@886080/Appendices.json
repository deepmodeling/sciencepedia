This practice, involving the design of license plates, is a classic illustration of this strategy. By calculating the number of possibilities for two distinct formats and then adding them together, you will apply the Sum Rule in a clear and direct context, combined with the Product Rule for sequential choices [@problem_id:1410901].", "problem": "A certain state's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) issues special license plates that follow one of two formats: Type-A or Type-B. The English alphabet is assumed to have 26 letters, with the set of vowels defined as {A, E, I, O, U} and all other letters defined as consonants. The available digits are {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.\n\nA Type-A license plate consists of three letters followed by two digits. For this type, the first letter must be a vowel. There are no other restrictions on the remaining letters or digits.\n\nA Type-B license plate consists of two letters followed by three digits. For this type, both letters must be consonants, and the first of the three digits cannot be zero.\n\nGiven these rules, how many distinct special license plates can be created? The two formats, Type-A and Type-B, represent mutually exclusive categories. Repetition of letters and digits is allowed unless a rule explicitly states otherwise.", "solution": "We apply basic counting rules: the rule of product (multiply independent choices) and the rule of sum (add counts from mutually exclusive cases).
