The student's argument is presented in four steps below. However, the argument contains a logical flaw.\n\n**The Purported Proof:**\n\n**Step 1: Base Case**\nFor $n=1$, the left-hand side (LHS) of the inequality is $\\sum_{k=1}^1 \\frac{1}{k^2} = \\frac{1}{1^2} = 1$. The right-hand side (RHS) is $2 - \\frac{1}{1} = 1$. Since $1 \\le 1$, the proposition $P(1)$ holds true.\n\n**Step 2: Inductive Hypothesis**\nAssume that for some arbitrary integer $m \\ge 1$, the proposition $P(m)$ is true. That is, we assume $\\sum_{k=1}^m \\frac{1}{k^2} \\le 2 - \\frac{1}{m}$.\n\n**Step 3: Inductive Step**\nWe aim to prove that $P(m+1)$ is true, i.e., $\\sum_{k=1}^{m+1} \\frac{1}{k^2} \\le 2 - \\frac{1}{m+1}$.\nWe begin with the LHS of $P(m+1)$:\nLHS = $\\sum_{k=1}^{m+1} \\frac{1}{k^2} = \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{k^2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{(m+1)^2}$.\nAccording to the inductive hypothesis from Step 2, we can substitute the sum, so we write:\nLHS = $\\left(2 - \\frac{1}{m}\\right) + \\frac{1}{(m+1)^2}$.\nNow, we just need to show that this resulting expression is less than or equal to the RHS of $P(m+1)$:\n$2 - \\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{1}{(m+1)^2} \\le 2 - \\frac{1}{m+1}$.\nSubtracting 2 from both sides gives:\n$-\\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{1}{(m+1)^2} \\le -\\frac{1}{m+1}$.\nRearranging the terms:\n$\\frac{1}{m+1} - \\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{1}{(m+1)^2} \\le 0$.\nFinding a common denominator for the fractions, $m(m+1)^2$:\n$\\frac{m(m+1) - (m+1)^2 + m}{m(m+1)^2} \\le 0$.\n$\\frac{m^2 + m - (m^2 + 2m + 1) + m}{m(m+1)^2} \\le 0$.\n$\\frac{m^2 + m - m^2 - 2m - 1 + m}{m(m+1)^2} \\le 0$.\n$\\frac{-1}{m(m+1)^2} \\le 0$.\nSince $m \\ge 1$, the denominator $m(m+1)^2$ is always positive.
