Let $\\Delta t_{k} = t_{k+1} - t_{k}$ and $\\Delta W_{k} = W_{t_{k+1}} - W_{t_{k}}$.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation using the telescoping identity**\n\nWe start with the provided algebraic identity:\n$$\nW_{t_{k+1}}^{2} - W_{t_{k}}^{2} = 2 W_{t_{k}} \\big(W_{t_{k+1}} - W_{t_{k}}\\big) + \\big(W_{t_{k+1}} - W_{t_{k}}\\big)^{2}\n$$\nSumming this identity over all subintervals of the partition, from $k=0$ to $k=n-1$:\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\big(W_{t_{k+1}}^{2} - W_{t_{k}}^{2}\\big) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 2 W_{t_{k}} \\big(W_{t_{k+1}} - W_{t_{k}}\\big) + \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\big(W_{t_{k+1}} - W_{t_{k}}\\big)^{2}\n$$\nThe left-hand side is a telescoping sum:\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\big(W_{t_{k+1}}^{2} - W_{t_{k}}^{2}\\big) = (W_{t_{1}}^{2} - W_{t_{0}}^{2}) + (W_{t_{2}}^{2} - W_{t_{1}}^{2}) + \\dots + (W_{t_{n}}^{2} - W_{t_{n-1}}^{2}) = W_{t_{n}}^{2} - W_{t_{0}}^{2}\n$$\nSince $t_{n}=t$ and a standard Brownian motion starts at zero, $W_{t_{0}} = W_{0} = 0$, the left-hand side simplifies to $W_{t}^{2}$. Thus, we have the exact relationship for any partition $\\pi$:\n$$\nW_{t}^{2} = 2 \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} W_{t_{k}} \\big(W_{t_{k+1}} - W_{t_{k}}\\big) + \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\big(W_{t_{k+1}} - W_{t_{k}}\\big)^{2}\n$$\nNow, we take the limit as the mesh of the partition $\\lvert \\pi \\rvert = \\max_{k} \\Delta t_{k}$ approaches $0$.\n\nThe first term on the right-hand side, $2 \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} W_{t_{k}} (W_{t_{k+1}} - W_{t_{k}})$, is twice the left-point Riemann sum approximation for the Itô integral of the process $W_{s}$ with respect to itself. According to the provided Foundational Fact 3, as $\\lvert \\pi \\rvert \\to 0$, this sum converges in mean square (and therefore in probability) to the Itô integral:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\lvert \\pi \\rvert \\to 0} 2 \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} W_{t_{k}} \\big(W_{t_{k+1}} - W_{t_{k}}\\big) = 2 \\int_{0}^{t} W_{s}\\,dW_{s}\n$$\nThe second term on the right-hand side is $S_{\\pi} = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\big(W_{t_{k+1}} - W_{t_{k}}\\big)^{2} = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (\\Delta W_{k})^{2}$. This is the surviving second-order term. We analyze its limit by showing it converges in mean square to $t$.\nFirst, we compute its expectation. Using the linearity of expectation and Foundational Fact 1 (that $\\Delta W_{k}$ is a Gaussian random variable with mean $0$ and variance $\\Delta t_{k}$):\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[S_{\\pi}] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (\\Delta W_{k})^{2}\\right] = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\mathbb{E}[(\\Delta W_{k})^{2}]\n$$\nThe second moment of $\\Delta W_{k}$ is its variance plus the square of its mean: $\\mathbb{E}[(\\Delta W_{k})^{2}] = \\text{Var}(\\Delta W_{k}) + (\\mathbb{E}[\\Delta W_{k}])^{2} = \\Delta t_{k} + 0^{2} = \\Delta t_{k}$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[S_{\\pi}] = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\Delta t_{k} = t_{n} - t_{0} = t\n$$\nNext, we compute the variance of $S_{\\pi}$. Since the increments $\\Delta W_{k}$ over non-overlapping intervals are independent (Foundational Fact 1), the random variables $(\\Delta W_{k})^{2}$ are also independent. Thus, the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(S_{\\pi}) = \\text{Var}\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (\\Delta W_{k})^{2}\\right) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\text{Var}\\big((\\Delta W_{k})^{2}\\big)\n$$\nThe variance of $(\\Delta W_{k})^{2}$ is $\\mathbb{E}[((\\Delta W_{k})^{2})^{2}] - (\\mathbb{E}[(\\Delta W_{k})^{2}])^{2} = \\mathbb{E}[(\\Delta W_{k})^{4}] - (\\Delta t_{k})^{2}$.\nFor a Gaussian random variable $Z \\sim N(0, \\sigma^{2})$, the fourth moment is $\\mathbb{E}[Z^{4}] = 3\\sigma^{4}$. Here, $\\sigma^{2} = \\Delta t_{k}$, so $\\mathbb{E}[(\\Delta W_{k})^{4}] = 3(\\Delta t_{k})^{2}$.\n$$\n\\text{Var}\\big((\\Delta W_{k})^{2}\\big) = 3(\\Delta t_{k})^{2} - (\\Delta t_{k})^{2} = 2(\\Delta t_{k})^{2}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\text{Var}(S_{\\pi})$:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(S_{\\pi}) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 2(\\Delta t_{k})^{2} = 2 \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (\\Delta t_{k})^{2}\n$$\nThis sum can be bounded: $\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (\\Delta t_{k})^{2} \\le \\left(\\max_{k} \\Delta t_{k}\\right) \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\Delta t_{k} = \\lvert \\pi \\rvert \\cdot t$.\nSo, $\\text{Var}(S_{\\pi}) \\le 2t\\lvert \\pi \\rvert$. As $\\lvert \\pi \\rvert \\to 0$, we have $\\text{Var}(S_{\\pi}) \\to 0$.\nSince $\\mathbb{E}[S_{\\pi}] = t$ and $\\text{Var}(S_{\\pi}) \\to 0$ as $\\lvert \\pi \\rvert \\to 0$, the sum $S_{\\pi}$ converges in mean square (which implies convergence in probability) to its mean, $t$.\n$$\n\\lim_{\\lvert \\pi \\rvert \\to 0} \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\big(W_{t_{k+1}} - W_{t_{k}}\\big)^{2} = t\n$$\nTaking the limit of the entire equation for $W_{t}^{2}$, we obtain:\n$$\nW_{t}^{2} = 2 \\int_{0}^{t} W_{s}\\,dW_{s} + t\n$$\n\n**Task 2: Interpretation and Counterexample**\n\nThe sum $S_{\\pi} = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\big(W_{t_{k+1}} - W_{t_{k}}\\big)^{2}$ is precisely the discrete sum used in Foundational Fact 2 to define the quadratic variation of a process with itself. With $X_{t} = Y_{t} = W_{t}$, the quadratic variation $[W,W]_{t}$ is:\n$$\n[W,W]_{t} = \\lim_{\\lvert \\pi \\rvert \\to 0} \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\big(W_{t_{k+1}} - W_{t_{k}}\\big)\\big(W_{t_{k+1}} - W_{t_{k}}\\big) = \\lim_{\\lvert \\pi \\rvert \\to 0} S_{\\pi}\n$$\nFrom our calculation in Task 1, this limit is $t$. So, $[W,W]_{t} = t$.\n\nThe naive rule from deterministic calculus, $dX_{t}\\,dY_{t} = 0$, suggests that the product of two infinitesimal changes is an infinitesimal of higher order and vanishes in the limit. In our context, with $X_{t}=Y_{t}=W_{t}$, this would translate to $(dW_{t})^{2}=0$. This implies that the sum of the squares of the increments, $\\sum (\\Delta W_{k})^{2}$, should converge to $0$. Our derivation proves this is false; the sum converges to $t$. The fact that $[W,W]_{t} = t \\neq 0$ for $t > 0$ provides a direct and fundamental counterexample to the naive application of deterministic calculus rules to stochastic processes.\n\nThe equation $W_{t}^{2} = 2 \\int_{0}^{t} W_{s}\\,dW_{s} + t$ is an integral form of Itô's Lemma for the function $f(x)=x^2$ applied to $W_{t}$. In differential form, this is written $d(W_{t}^{2}) = 2 W_{t}\\,dW_{t} + dt$. The emergent Itô correction term is the `$dt$` term. This term's origin is precisely the non-vanishing limit of the sum of squared increments, i.e., the quadratic variation. The second-order term from the Taylor expansion, which is negligible in deterministic calculus, survives in stochastic calculus and contributes a finite, non-random term to the dynamics.\n\n**Task 3: Explicit expression for $[W,W]_{t}$**\n\nAs established in the previous tasks, the explicit analytic expression for the quadratic variation of a standard Brownian motion with itself is derived from the mean-square limit of the sum of its squared increments over a partition of $[0,t]$.\n$$\n[W,W]_{t} = \\lim_{\\lvert \\pi \\rvert \\to 0} \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (W_{t_{k+1}} - W_{t_{k}})^2\n$$\nOur detailed justification in Task 1 showed that this limit is equal to $t$.

Now we substitute the given SDEs for $X_{t}$ and $Y_{t}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}(X_{t}Y_{t}) = Y_{t}\\Bigl(\\kappa_{X}(\\theta_{X}-X_{t})\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma_{X}\\,\\mathrm{d}W^{1}_{t}\\Bigr) + X_{t}\\Bigl(\\kappa_{Y}(\\theta_{Y}-Y_{t})\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma_{Y}\\,\\mathrm{d}W^{2}_{t}\\Bigr)\n$$\nWe expand and collect terms based on the differentials $\\mathrm{d}t$, $\\mathrm{d}W^{1}_{t}$, and $\\mathrm{d}W^{2}_{t}$.\nThe terms multiplying $\\mathrm{d}t$ form the drift coefficient, $b(X_{t},Y_{t})$:\n$$\nb(X_{t},Y_{t})\\,\\mathrm{d}t = Y_{t}\\kappa_{X}(\\theta_{X}-X_{t})\\,\\mathrm{d}t + X_{t}\\kappa_{Y}(\\theta_{Y}-Y_{t})\\,\\mathrm{d}t\n$$\n$$\nb(X_{t},Y_{t}) = \\kappa_{X}\\theta_{X}Y_{t} - \\kappa_{X}X_{t}Y_{t} + \\kappa_{Y}\\theta_{Y}X_{t} - \\kappa_{Y}X_{t}Y_{t}\n$$\n$$\nb(X_{t},Y_{t}) = \\kappa_{X}\\theta_{X}Y_{t} + \\kappa_{Y}\\theta_{Y}X_{t} - (\\kappa_{X}+\\kappa_{Y})X_{t}Y_{t}\n$$\nThe term multiplying $\\mathrm{d}W^{1}_{t}$ is the first diffusion coefficient, $g_{1}(X_{t},Y_{t})$:\n$$\ng_{1}(X_{t},Y_{t})\\,\\mathrm{d}W^{1}_{t} = Y_{t}\\sigma_{X}\\,\\mathrm{d}W^{1}_{t} \\implies g_{1}(X_{t},Y_{t}) = \\sigma_{X}Y_{t}\n$$\nThe term multiplying $\\mathrm{d}W^{2}_{t}$ is the second diffusion coefficient, $g_{2}(X_{t},Y_{t})$:\n$$\ng_{2}(X_{t},Y_{t})\\,\\mathrm{d}W^{2}_{t} = X_{t}\\sigma_{Y}\\,\\mathrm{d}W^{2}_{t} \\implies g_{2}(X_{t},Y_{t}) = \\sigma_{Y}X_{t}\n$$\nCombining these results, the SDE for the product $X_{t}Y_{t}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}(X_{t}Y_{t}) = \\Bigl(\\kappa_{X}\\theta_{X}Y_{t} + \\kappa_{Y}\\theta_{Y}X_{t} - (\\kappa_{X}+\\kappa_{Y})X_{t}Y_{t}\\Bigr)\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma_{X}Y_{t}\\,\\mathrm{d}W^{1}_{t} + \\sigma_{Y}X_{t}\\,\\mathrm{d}W^{2}_{t}\n$$\nThe problem requires the result to be presented as a row matrix of the coefficients $(b, g_1, g_2)$.
