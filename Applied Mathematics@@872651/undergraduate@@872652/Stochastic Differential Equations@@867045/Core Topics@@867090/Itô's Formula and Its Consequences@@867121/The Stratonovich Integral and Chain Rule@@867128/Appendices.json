The derivation must begin from the provided definition of the Stratonovich integral as the mean-square limit of symmetric Riemann sums.\n\nLet us consider a partition of the time interval $[0, t]$ given by $0 = t_0 < t_1 < \\cdots < t_n = t$. The change in the value of the function $f(W_s) = W_s^2$ over this interval is $f(W_t) - f(W_0) = W_t^2 - W_0^2$. We can express this difference as a telescoping sum over the partition:\n$$\nW_t^2 - W_0^2 = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\left( W_{t_{i+1}}^2 - W_{t_i}^2 \\right)\n$$\nThis identity holds for any finite partition.

The tasks are formalizable and computationally feasible. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Theoretical Framework\n\n#### (i) Derivation of the Itô-Stratonovich Conversion Formula\n\nThe relationship between the Stratonovich integral ($\\circ dW_t$) and the Itô integral ($dW_t$) is central to this problem. A formal way to establish this is through the quadratic covariation between the process $g(X_t)$ and the Brownian motion $W_t$. The Stratonovich integral is defined in terms of the Itô integral and their covariation as:\n$$\n\\int_0^t g(X_s) \\circ dW_s = \\int_0^t g(X_s) \\,dW_s + \\frac{1}{2} [g(X), W]_t\n$$\nIn differential form, this is $g(X_t) \\circ dW_t = g(X_t) \\,dW_t + \\frac{1}{2} d[g(X), W]_t$.\n\nOur task is to evaluate the covariation term $d[g(X), W]_t$. Using the properties of quadratic variation and Itô's lemma, we can find the differential of $g(X_t)$:\n$$\ndg(X_t) = g'(X_t) dX_t + \\frac{1}{2} g''(X_t) (dX_t)^2\n$$\nThe covariation $d[g(X), W]_t$ is found by formally multiplying the differentials $dg(X_t)$ and $dW_t$ and applying the rules of Itô calculus ($dt \\cdot dt = 0$, $dt \\cdot dW_t = 0$, $dW_t \\cdot dW_t = dt$). To determine $dX_t$, we must assume an Itô form for the SDE, $dX_t = f_I(X_t) dt + g(X_t) dW_t$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $dg(X_t)$ gives:\n$$\ndg(X_t) = g'(X_t) (f_I(X_t) dt + g(X_t) dW_t) + \\frac{1}{2} g''(X_t) (g(X_t) dW_t)^2\n$$\n$$\ndg(X_t) = \\left( g'(X_t) f_I(X_t) + \\frac{1}{2} g''(X_t) g(X_t)^2 \\right) dt + g'(X_t) g(X_t) dW_t\n$$\nThe quadratic covariation $d[g(X), W]_t$ isolates the terms from $dg(X_t)$ that covary with $dW_t$. This corresponds to the coefficient of the $dW_t$ term in $dg(X_t)$, multiplied by $dt$. More formally, $d[g(X), W]_t = (g'(X_t) g(X_t) dW_t) \\cdot dW_t = g'(X_t) g(X_t) dt$.\n\nSubstituting this result back into the definition of the Stratonovich differential:\n$$\ng(X_t) \\circ dW_t = g(X_t) \\,dW_t + \\frac{1}{2} g'(X_t) g(X_t) dt\n$$\nNow, we can convert the original Stratonovich SDE, $dX_t = f_S(X_t) dt + g(X_t) \\circ dW_t$, into its Itô equivalent by substituting the expression for $g(X_t) \\circ dW_t$:\n$$\ndX_t = f_S(X_t) dt + \\left( g(X_t) \\,dW_t + \\frac{1}{2} g'(X_t) g(X_t) dt \\right)\n$$\nGrouping the $dt$ terms, we arrive at the Itô form $dX_t = f_I(X_t) dt + g(X_t) dW_t$, where the Itô drift $f_I(X_t)$ is:\n$$\nf_I(X_t) = f_S(X_t) + \\frac{1}{2} g(X_t) g'(X_t)\n$$\nThis is the required conversion formula. The Itô diffusion coefficient remains $g(X_t)$.\n\n#### (ii) Euler–Maruyama Scheme for the Converted Itô SDE\n\nGiven the Itô SDE $dX_t = f_I(X_t) dt + g(X_t) dW_t$, the Euler–Maruyama method discretizes time into steps of size $\\Delta t = T/N$. The state at time $t_{n+1} = (n+1)\\Delta t$ is approximated from the state at $t_n = n\\Delta t$ as follows:\n$$\nX_{n+1} = X_n + f_I(X_n) \\Delta t + g(X_n) \\Delta W_n\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta W_n = W_{t_{n+1}} - W_{t_n}$ are independent random variables drawn from a normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, \\Delta t)$. For our implementation, we use the derived Itô drift $f_I(X_n) = f_S(X_n) + \\frac{1}{2} g(X_n) g'(X_n)$. The algorithm is:\n1. Initialize $X_0 = x_0$.\n2. For $n = 0, 1, \\dots, N-1$:\n   a. Compute the drift $f_I(X_n) = f_S(X_n) + \\frac{1}{2}g(X_n)g'(X_n)$.\n   b. Compute the diffusion $g(X_n)$.\n   c. Update the state: $X_{n+1} = X_n + f_I(X_n) \\Delta t + g(X_n) \\Delta W_n$.\n3. The result is $X_N$, an approximation of $X_T$.\n\n#### (iii) Native Stratonovich Heun Scheme\n\nThe Heun method for Stratonovich SDEs is a predictor-corrector scheme that aligns with the midpoint interpretation of the Stratonovich integral. It can be viewed as applying the trapezoidal rule to both the deterministic and stochastic integrals.\nGiven the Stratonovich SDE $dX_t = f_S(X_t) dt + g(X_t) \\circ dW_t$, the scheme is:\n1. **Predictor Step:** First, an auxiliary state $\\bar{X}_{n+1}$ is estimated using an explicit Euler step.\n   $$\n   \\bar{X}_{n+1} = X_n + f_S(X_n) \\Delta t + g(X_n) \\Delta W_n\n   $$\n2. **Corrector Step:** The final state $X_{n+1}$ is computed by averaging the drift and diffusion functions evaluated at the current state $X_n$ and the predicted state $\\bar{X}_{n+1}$.\n   $$\n   X_{n+1} = X_n + \\frac{f_S(X_n) + f_S(\\bar{X}_{n+1})}{2} \\Delta t + \\frac{g(X_n) + g(\\bar{X}_{n+1})}{2} \\Delta W_n\n   $$\nThe algorithm is:\n1. Initialize $X_0 = x_0$.\n2. For $n = 0, 1, \\dots, N-1$:\n   a. Predict: $\\bar{X}_{n+1} = X_n + f_S(X_n) \\Delta t + g(X_n) \\Delta W_n$.\n   b. Correct: $X_{n+1} = X_n + \\frac{1}{2}(f_S(X_n) + f_S(\\bar{X}_{n+1})) \\Delta t + \\frac{1}{2}(g(X_n) + g(\\bar{X}_{n+1})) \\Delta W_n$.\n3. The result is $X_N \\approx X_T$.\n\n#### (iv) Numerical Implications and Comparison\n\n- **Order of Convergence:** The primary distinction between the two methods is their order of strong convergence. The Euler–Maruyama method has a strong order of $0.5$, meaning the terminal error $|X_T - X_N|$ scales as $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{\\Delta t})$. The Stratonovich Heun scheme has a strong order of $1.0$ for scalar SDEs, so its error scales as $\\mathcal{O}(\\Delta t)$. This implies that for a given step size $\\Delta t$, the Heun method should be substantially more accurate.\n- **Chain Rule and Modeling:** The Stratonovich chain rule mirrors the form of the classical chain rule, $dF(X_t) = F'(X_t) \\circ dX_t$. This is often preferred in physical modeling where the noise term represents a smoothed, physically realistic process rather than a purely mathematical abstraction. In contrast, the Itô chain rule includes a second-order correction term, which can be less intuitive. The \"convert to Itô\" approach effectively hides this complexity within the modified drift term.\n- **Computational Cost:** The Itô-Euler method requires one evaluation of $f_S$, $g$, and $g'$ per step. The Stratonovich-Heun method requires two evaluations of $f_S$ and $g$ per step but does not require the derivative $g'$. Thus, the Heun method's cost per step is roughly double that of Euler's, but its higher accuracy often allows for a larger step size $\\Delta t$ to achieve the same error, potentially making it more efficient overall.\n- **Deterministic Limit:** As seen in Test C where $g(x)=0$, the SDE reduces to an ordinary differential equation (ODE). The Itô-Euler method becomes the forward Euler method (first-order accurate for ODEs), while the Stratonovich-Heun scheme becomes the improved Euler/trapezoidal method (second-order accurate for ODEs). This highlights the higher-order nature of the Heun scheme.\n\n### Application to Test Cases\n\n**Test A: Geometric Stratonovich SDE**\n- SDE: $dX_t = a X_t dt + b X_t \\circ dW_t$.\n- Functions: $f_S(x) = a x$, $g(x) = b x$.\n- Derivative: $g'(x) = b$.\n- Itô drift: $f_I(x) = a x + \\frac{1}{2} (b x)(b) = (a + \\frac{1}{2} b^2) x$.\n- Exact solution: $X_T = x_0 \\exp(a T + b W_T)$, where $W_T = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \\Delta W_n$.\n\n**Test B: Nonlinear Trigonometric SDE**\n- Functions: $f_S(x) = -k \\sin(x)$, $g(x) = \\sigma \\cos(x)$.\n- Derivative: $g'(x) = -\\sigma \\sin(x)$.\n- Itô drift: $f_I(x) = -k \\sin(x) + \\frac{1}{2} (\\sigma \\cos(x))(-\\sigma \\sin(x)) = -k \\sin(x) - \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 \\sin(x) \\cos(x)$.\n- Chain rule test: For $F(x) = \\sin(x)$, $F'(x) = \\cos(x)$. The chain rule implies $F(X_T) - F(X_0) = \\int_0^T \\cos(X_t)(-k \\sin(X_t)) dt + \\int_0^T \\cos(X_t)(\\sigma \\cos(X_t)) \\circ dW_t$. The numerical residual measures the accuracy of approximating this identity using the trapezoidal rule along the Heun path.\n\n**Test C: Deterministic ODE**\n- Functions: $f_S(x) = a x$, $g(x) = 0$.\n- Derivative: $g'(x) = 0$.\n- Itô drift: $f_I(x) = a x + 0 = a x$. $f_I = f_S$.\n- Exact solution: $X_T = x_0 \\exp(a T)$.\n- The Itô-Euler scheme becomes the forward Euler method. The Stratonovich-Heun scheme becomes the trapezoidal (improved Euler) method.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the problem by implementing and comparing two numerical methods for Stratonovich SDEs\n    across a suite of three test cases.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Global settings\n    RNG_SEED = 123456\n    rng = np.random.default_rng(RNG_SEED)\n\n    def generate_brownian_increments(T, N):\n        \"\"\"Generates Brownian motion increments.\"\"\"\n        delta_t = T / N\n        return rng.normal(0.0, np.sqrt(delta_t), N)\n\n    def solve_ito_euler(f_S, g, g_prime, x0, T, N, delta_W):\n        \"\"\"\n        Solves a Stratonovich SDE by converting it to Itô form and using the Euler-Maruyama method.\n        \"\"\"\n        x = x0\n        delta_t = T / N\n        \n        # Itô drift\n        def f_I(val):\n            return f_S(val) + 0.5 * g(val) * g_prime(val)\n\n        for dW in delta_W:\n            x = x + f_I(x) * delta_t + g(x) * dW\n        return x\n\n    def solve_strat_heun(f_S, g, x0, T, N, delta_W, return_path=False):\n        \"\"\"\n        Solves a Stratonovich SDE using the native Heun (predictor-corrector) method.\n        \"\"\"\n        path = np.zeros(N + 1)\n        path[0] = x0\n        delta_t = T / N\n\n        for i in range(N):\n            # Predictor step\n            x_n = path[i]\n            x_bar = x_n + f_S(x_n) * delta_t + g(x_n) * delta_W[i]\n            \n            # Corrector step\n            f_avg = 0.5 * (f_S(x_n) + f_S(x_bar))\n            g_avg = 0.5 * (g(x_n) + g(x_bar))\n            path[i+1] = x_n + f_avg * delta_t + g_avg * delta_W[i]\n        \n        if return_path:\n            return path\n        return path[-1]\n\n    results = []\n\n    # --- Test A: Geometric Stratonovich SDE ---\n    a_A, b_A, x0_A, T_A, N_A = 0.25, 0.6, 0.9, 1.3, 20000\n    \n    fS_A = lambda x: a_A * x\n    g_A = lambda x: b_A * x\n    g_prime_A = lambda x: b_A\n    \n    delta_W_A = generate_brownian_increments(T_A, N_A)\n    W_T_A = np.sum(delta_W_A)\n\n    x_T_exact_A = x0_A * np.exp(a_A * T_A + b_A * W_T_A)\n\n    x_T_ito_A = solve_ito_euler(fS_A, g_A, g_prime_A, x0_A, T_A, N_A, delta_W_A)\n    x_T_heun_A = solve_strat_heun(fS_A, g_A, x0_A, T_A, N_A, delta_W_A)\n    \n    error_ito_A = np.abs(x_T_ito_A - x_T_exact_A)\n    error_heun_A = np.abs(x_T_heun_A - x_T_exact_A)\n    \n    results.extend([error_ito_A, error_heun_A])\n\n    # --- Test B: Nonlinear Trigonometric SDE ---\n    k_B, sigma_B, x0_B, T_B, N_B = 1.7, 1.1, 0.2, 0.8, 15000\n    \n    fS_B = lambda x: -k_B * np.sin(x)\n    g_B = lambda x: sigma_B * np.cos(x)\n    g_prime_B = lambda x: -sigma_B * np.sin(x)\n\n    delta_W_B = generate_brownian_increments(T_B, N_B)\n    delta_t_B = T_B / N_B\n\n    x_T_ito_B = solve_ito_euler(fS_B, g_B, g_prime_B, x0_B, T_B, N_B, delta_W_B)\n    path_heun_B = solve_strat_heun(fS_B, g_B, x0_B, T_B, N_B, delta_W_B, return_path=True)\n    x_T_heun_B = path_heun_B[-1]\n    \n    method_diff_B = np.abs(x_T_ito_B - x_T_heun_B)\n    \n    # Chain rule verification\n    F = np.sin\n    F_prime = np.cos\n    \n    # LHS of chain rule: F(X_T) - F(X_0)\n    chain_rule_lhs = F(x_T_heun_B) - F(x0_B)\n    \n    # RHS: ∫ F'(X)f_S(X)dt + ∫ F'(X)g(X)∘dW\n    h1 = lambda x: F_prime(x) * fS_B(x) # Integrand for dt\n    h2 = lambda x: F_prime(x) * g_B(x)  # Integrand for ∘dW\n    \n    h1_path = h1(path_heun_B)\n    h2_path = h2(path_heun_B)\n    \n    # Trapezoidal rule for both integrals\n    integral_dt = np.sum(0.5 * (h1_path[:-1] + h1_path[1:]) * delta_t_B)\n    integral_dW = np.sum(0.5 * (h2_path[:-1] + h2_path[1:]) * delta_W_B)\n    \n    chain_rule_rhs = integral_dt + integral_dW\n    chain_rule_residual = np.abs(chain_rule_lhs - chain_rule_rhs)\n\n    results.extend([method_diff_B, chain_rule_residual])\n\n    # --- Test C: Deterministic ODE (boundary case) ---\n    a_C, b_C, x0_C, T_C, N_C = -0.4, 0.0, 1.5, 1.0, 1000\n\n    fS_C = lambda x: a_C * x\n    g_C = lambda x: b_C * x # which is always 0\n    g_prime_C = lambda x: b_C # which is always 0\n    \n    # dW is generated but will be multiplied by 0\n    delta_W_C = generate_brownian_increments(T_C, N_C)\n    \n    x_T_exact_C = x0_C * np.exp(a_C * T_C)\n    \n    x_T_ito_C = solve_ito_euler(fS_C, g_C, g_prime_C, x0_C, T_C, N_C, delta_W_C)\n    x_T_heun_C = solve_strat_heun(fS_C, g_C, x0_C, T_C, N_C, delta_W_C)\n    \n    error_ito_C = np.abs(x_T_ito_C - x_T_exact_C)\n    error_heun_C = np.abs(x_T_heun_C - x_T_exact_C)\n    \n    results.extend([error_ito_C, error_heun_C])\n\n    # Final output formatting\n    print(f\"[{','.join(map(str, results))}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "3082192"}]}
