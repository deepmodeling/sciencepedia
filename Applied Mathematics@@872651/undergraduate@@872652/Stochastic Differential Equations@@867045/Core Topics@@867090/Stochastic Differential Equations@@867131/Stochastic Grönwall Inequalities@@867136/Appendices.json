It is scientifically grounded in the theory of integral equations and their application to stochastic differential equations. The premises are clear, consistent, and do not violate any mathematical or logical principles. All information required for a unique solution is provided. I shall therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nWe are given the integral inequality for a non-negative function $u(t)$:\n$$\nu(t) \\le 3 + \\int_{0}^{t}(1+s)u(s)ds, \\quad t \\ge 0.\n$$\nThe function $u(t)$ is defined as $u(t) = \\mathbb{E}[|X_t|]$, which guarantees its non-negativity, i.e., $u(t) \\ge 0$ for all $t \\ge 0$.\n\nTo find an explicit bound for $u(t)$, we introduce an auxiliary function, $v(t)$, defined as the right-hand side of the given inequality:\n$$\nv(t) = 3 + \\int_{0}^{t}(1+s)u(s)ds.\n$$\nFrom this definition, it is immediately evident that $u(t) \\le v(t)$ for all $t \\ge 0$.\n\nSince $u(s) \\ge 0$ and $(1+s)  0$ for $s \\ge 0$, the integrand $(1+s)u(s)$ is non-negative. This implies that the integral term is a non-decreasing function of $t$. Consequently, $v(t)$ is non-decreasing.\nLet us evaluate $v(t)$ at $t=0$:\n$$\nv(0) = 3 + \\int_{0}^{0}(1+s)u(s)ds = 3+0 = 3.\n$$\nSince $v(t)$ is non-decreasing, we have $v(t) \\ge v(0) = 3$ for all $t \\ge 0$.\n\nThe function $u(t)$ is given to be finite for all $t$, which implies it is locally integrable on $[0, \\infty)$. Therefore, the function $v(t)$, being the sum of a constant and an integral of a locally integrable function, is an absolutely continuous function of $t$. According to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which applies to absolutely continuous functions, the derivative of $v(t)$ exists for almost every $t \\ge 0$ and is given by:\n$$\nv'(t) = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(3 + \\int_{0}^{t}(1+s)u(s)ds\\right) = (1+t)u(t) \\quad \\text{a.e.}\n$$\nWe now combine the relations we have established. Using $u(t) \\le v(t)$ and the fact that $(1+t)0$ for $t \\ge 0$, we can write:\n$$\nv'(t) = (1+t)u(t) \\le (1+t)v(t) \\quad \\text{a.e.}\n$$\nThis gives us a first-order linear differential inequality for $v(t)$:\n$$\nv'(t) - (1+t)v(t) \\le 0 \\quad \\text{a.e.}\n$$\nWe can solve this inequality using the method of integrating factors. The appropriate integrating factor, $I(t)$, is\n$$\nI(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\int_{0}^{t}(1+s)ds\\right).\n$$\nThe integral in the exponent evaluates to:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t}(1+s)ds = \\left[s + \\frac{s^2}{2}\\right]_{0}^{t} = t + \\frac{t^2}{2}.\n$$\nThus, the integrating factor is:\n$$\nI(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\left(t + \\frac{t^2}{2}\\right)\\right).\n$$\nNote that $I(t)  0$ for all $t$. Multiplying the differential inequality by $I(t)$ does not alter its direction:\n$$\nI(t)v'(t) - (1+t)I(t)v(t) \\le 0 \\quad \\text{a.e.}\n$$\nThe left-hand side of this inequality is, by the product rule for differentiation (which is valid for the product of an absolutely continuous function and a $C^1$ function), the derivative of the product $I(t)v(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\left( I(t)v(t) \\right) \\le 0 \\quad \\text{a.e.}\n$$\nAn absolutely continuous function whose derivative is non-positive almost everywhere on an interval is a non-increasing function on that interval. Therefore, for any $t \\ge 0$:\n$$\nI(t)v(t) \\le I(0)v(0).\n$$\nWe previously found $v(0)=3$, and $I(0) = \\exp(0) = 1$.

The calculation above shows $\\mathbb{E}[\\mathcal{E}(b W)_{t}] = 1$, which implies that the stochastic exponential is a mean-one random weight. This property is crucial in exponential integrator schemes: when one exactly accounts for the multiplicative noise via the integrating factor, the mean-one property prevents bias in expectations and stabilizes the scheme’s treatment of the stochastic component.\n\nIn the context of stochastic Grönwall inequalities, suppose a nonnegative process $Y_{t}$ satisfies an inequality of the form\n$$\nY_{t} \\leq \\alpha + \\int_{0}^{t} \\beta\\, Y_{s}\\, ds + \\int_{0}^{t} \\gamma\\, Y_{s}\\, dW_{s},\n$$\nwith constants $\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma \\geq 0$. Multiplying both sides by the integrating factor $\\mathcal{E}(\\gamma W)_{t}^{-1}$ eliminates the stochastic integral, allowing one to apply a deterministic Grönwall-type argument to $\\mathcal{E}(\\gamma W)_{t}^{-1} Y_{t}$. Taking expectations and using $\\mathbb{E}[\\mathcal{E}(\\gamma W)_{t}] = 1$ ensures that the stochastic integrating factor does not inflate the bound, leading to a tractable control in expectation akin to the classical Grönwall inequality.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the General Bound\n\nThe starting point is the given integral inequality, which holds almost surely for each sample path:\n$$\nX_{t} \\le A_{t} + \\int_{0}^{t} B_{s}\\,X_{s}\\,ds\n$$\nLet us fix a sample path $\\omega \\in \\Omega$. For this path, $X_t(\\omega)$, $A_t(\\omega)$, and $B_s(\\omega)$ are deterministic, nonnegative functions of time. Let's denote them by $x(t)$, $a(t)$, and $b(s)$ respectively. The inequality is:\n$$\nx(t) \\le a(t) + \\int_{0}^{t} b(s)\\,x(s)\\,ds\n$$\nThe standard integral form of the deterministic Grönwall inequality states that if a function $u(t)$ satisfies $u(t) \\le \\phi(t) + \\int_0^t \\psi(s)u(s)ds$ for nonnegative functions $\\psi$, then $u(t) \\le \\phi(t) + \\int_0^t \\phi(s)\\psi(s)\\exp\\left(\\int_s^t \\psi(r)dr\\right)ds$. Applying this to our pathwise inequality with $u(t)=x(t)$, $\\phi(t)=a(t)$, and $\\psi(s)=b(s)$, we get:\n$$\nx(t) \\le a(t) + \\int_{0}^{t} a(s)b(s)\\exp\\left(\\int_{s}^{t} b(r)\\,dr\\right)ds\n$$\nThe problem states that $A_t$ is almost surely nondecreasing. This means for our deterministic path, $a(t)$ is a nondecreasing function of $t$. Thus, for any $s \\in [0, t]$, we have $a(s) \\le a(t)$. Since all terms in the integral are nonnegative ($a(s)\\ge0$, $b(s)\\ge0$), we can bound the integral:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t} a(s)b(s)\\exp\\left(\\int_{s}^{t} b(r)\\,dr\\right)ds \\le \\int_{0}^{t} a(t)b(s)\\exp\\left(\\int_{s}^{t} b(r)\\,dr\\right)ds = a(t) \\int_{0}^{t} b(s)\\exp\\left(\\int_{s}^{t} b(r)\\,dr\\right)ds\n$$\nLet's evaluate the integral $I = \\int_{0}^{t} b(s)\\exp\\left(\\int_{s}^{t} b(r)\\,dr\\right)ds$. Let $u(s) = \\int_{s}^{t} b(r)\\,dr$. Then $\\frac{du}{ds} = -b(s)$, so $b(s)ds = -du$. The limits of integration for $u$ are $u(0) = \\int_{0}^{t} b(r)\\,dr$ and $u(t) = \\int_{t}^{t} b(r)\\,dr = 0$.\n$$\nI = \\int_{u(0)}^{u(t)} \\exp(u) (-du) = \\int_0^{u(0)} \\exp(u)du = [\\exp(u)]_{0}^{u(0)} = \\exp(u(0)) - \\exp(0) = \\exp\\left(\\int_{0}^{t} b(r)\\,dr\\right) - 1\n$$\nSubstituting this back, we get:\n$$\nx(t) \\le a(t) + a(t) \\left(\\exp\\left(\\int_{0}^{t} b(r)\\,dr\\right) - 1\\right) = a(t) \\exp\\left(\\int_{0}^{t} b(r)\\,dr\\right)\n$$\nReverting to the stochastic process notation, this inequality holds almost surely:\n$$\nX_{t} \\le A_{t} \\exp\\left(\\int_{0}^{t} B_{s}\\,ds\\right)\n$$\nSince both sides are nonnegative random variables, we can take the expectation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X_{t}] \\le \\mathbb{E}\\left[A_{t} \\exp\\left(\\int_{0}^{t} B_{s}\\,ds\\right)\\right]\n$$\nThe problem states that for each $t \\in [0, T]$, the random variable $A_t$ is independent of the $\\sigma$-algebra $\\sigma(B_s : 0 \\le s \\le t)$. The random variable $V_t = \\exp\\left(\\int_{0}^{t} B_{s}\\,ds\\right)$ is a function of the path $\\{B_s\\}_{s \\in [0,t]}$ and is therefore measurable with respect to $\\sigma(B_s : 0 \\le s \\le t)$.
