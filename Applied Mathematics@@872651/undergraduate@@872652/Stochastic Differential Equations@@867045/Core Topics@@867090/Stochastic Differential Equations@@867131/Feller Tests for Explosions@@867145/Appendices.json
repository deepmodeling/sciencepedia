Feller's test for non-explosion states that the process is non-explosive if the test integral for each boundary diverges.

So, the scale density is $s'(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2}$.\n\nNext, we compute the speed measure density $m(x)$, given by:\n$$\nm(x) = \\frac{2}{\\sigma^{2}(x)s'(x)}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\sigma(x)$ and $s'(x)$:\n$$\nm(x) = \\frac{2}{1^2 \\cdot x^{-2}} = 2x^2\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nFor the second part, we must determine if the boundary point $0$ is accessible and compute the probability $p(x_0) = \\mathbb{P}_{x_0}(\\tau_0  \\infty)$, where $\\tau_0$ is the first hitting time of $0$. This is accomplished using the scale function, $s(x)$, which is obtained by integrating the scale density $s'(x)$.\nThe scale function $s(x)$ is defined as:\n$$\ns(x) = \\int_{c}^{x} s'(y)\\,dy\n$$\nwhere $c$ is an arbitrary reference point in the interior of the domain, say $c=1$.\n$$\ns(x) = \\int_{c}^{x} y^{-2}\\,dy = \\left[-\\frac{1}{y}\\right]_{c}^{x} = -\\frac{1}{x} - \\left(-\\frac{1}{c}\\right) = \\frac{1}{c} - \\frac{1}{x}\n$$\nThe scale function is defined up to an affine transformation of the form $A s(x) + B$ for constants $A \\neq 0$ and $B$. Such a transformation does not alter the hitting probabilities. We can choose the constants to obtain the simplest form, which is equivalent to setting $c \\to \\infty$ or just taking the core functional part. Let's use the simple form:\n$$\ns(x) = -\\frac{1}{x}\n$$\nThe accessibility of a boundary and the probability of hitting it are determined by the behavior of the scale function at the boundary points. For a diffusion on an interval $(l, r)$, the probability of the process starting at $x_0 \\in (l, r)$ hitting the boundary $l$ before hitting the boundary $r$ is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}_{x_0}(\\tau_l  \\tau_r) = \\frac{s(r) - s(x_0)}{s(r) - s(l)}\n$$\nwhere $s(l) = \\lim_{x \\to l^+} s(x)$ and $s(r) = \\lim_{x \\to r^-} s(x)$.\nIn our case, the interval is $(0, \\infty)$, so we have $l=0$ and $r=\\infty$. The probability of hitting $0$ before 'escaping to infinity' is what we need to calculate for $p(x_0) = \\mathbb{P}_{x_0}(\\tau_0  \\infty)$. We compute the limits of our scale function at the boundaries:\n$$\ns(0) = \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} s(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 0^+} \\left(-\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = -\\infty\n$$\n$$\ns(\\infty) = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} s(x) = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\left(-\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0\n$$\nNow, we can substitute these values into the formula for the hitting probability:\n$$\np(x_0) = \\mathbb{P}_{x_0}(\\tau_0  \\tau_\\infty) = \\frac{s(\\infty) - s(x_0)}{s(\\infty) - s(0)} = \\frac{0 - (-1/x_0)}{0 - (-\\infty)}\n$$\nThe numerator is $1/x_0$, which is a finite positive value for any starting point $x_0 \\in (0, \\infty)$. The denominator is infinite.\n$$\np(x_0) = \\frac{1/x_0}{\\infty} = 0\n$$\nThe probability of the process reaching the boundary at $0$ in finite time is $0$, regardless of the starting position $x_0$.\n\nThis result directly answers the question about accessibility. A boundary is said to be accessible if there is a positive probability of reaching it in finite time from at least one point in the interior of the domain. Since we have found that $\\mathbb{P}_{x_0}(\\tau_0  \\infty) = 0$ for all $x_0 \\in (0, \\infty)$, the boundary point $0$ is **inaccessible**.\n\nFeller's boundary classification rules confirm this. One of the conditions for a boundary $l$ to be accessible from the interior is that the integral $\\int_{l}^{c} s'(y) \\, dy$ must be finite for some $c \\in (l,r)$. In our case, for the boundary $l=0$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{c} s'(y) \\, dy = \\int_{0}^{c} y^{-2} \\, dy = \\left[-\\frac{1}{y}\\right]_{0}^{c} = -\\frac{1}{c} - \\lim_{y \\to 0^+} \\left(-\\frac{1}{y}\\right) = \\infty\n$$\nSince this integral diverges, the condition for accessibility is not met. The boundary at $0$ is inaccessible, which is consistent with the hitting probability being $0$. The strong positive drift $1/x$ near $x=0$ pushes the process away from the origin, overpowering the constant diffusion term and preventing the process from ever reaching $0$.\n\nThe final answer required is the value of the probability $p(x_0)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "3053658"}, {"introduction": "This final practice demonstrates how the qualitative behavior of a stochastic process can depend critically on its parameters.

Let the boundary point be $a$ (in our case, $a=0$) and let $c$ be an arbitrary point in the interior of the state space (e.g., $c=1$). The classification depends on the scale function density $s'(x)$ and the speed measure density $m(x)$.\n\nThe scale function density $s'(x)$ is defined as:\n$$s'(x) = \\exp\\left( - \\int_{c}^{x} \\frac{2b(y)}{\\sigma^2(y)} dy \\right)$$\nFor our SDE, we have $b(y) = 2\\alpha$ and $\\sigma^2(y) = (2\\sqrt{y})^2 = 4y$.
