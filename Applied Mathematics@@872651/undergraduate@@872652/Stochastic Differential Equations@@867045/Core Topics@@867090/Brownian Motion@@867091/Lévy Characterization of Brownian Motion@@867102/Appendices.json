I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem has two parts: first, to compute the quadratic variation of the process $X_t$, and second, to use this result along with Lévy's characterization to determine if $X_t$ is a Brownian motion.\n\nLet the process $X_t$ be defined as $X_t = \\int_0^t \\cos(s) \\, dB_s$. This is an Itô integral of the form $X_t = \\int_0^t H_s \\, dB_s$, where the integrand is the deterministic process $H_s = \\cos(s)$.\n\nFirst, we find the quadratic variation of $X_t$, denoted by $[X]_t$. A fundamental property of Itô integrals states that for a process $Y_t = \\int_0^t H_s \\, dB_s$, where $H_s$ is a suitable predictable process, its quadratic variation is given by the integral of the square of the integrand with respect to time:\n$$\n[Y]_t = \\int_0^t H_s^2 \\, ds\n$$\nApplying this property to our process $X_t$, with $H_s = \\cos(s)$, we have:\n$$\n[X]_t = \\int_0^t (\\cos(s))^2 \\, ds\n$$\nTo evaluate this integral, we use the trigonometric power-reduction identity:\n$$\n\\cos^2(\\theta) = \\frac{1 + \\cos(2\\theta)}{2}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the integral, we get:\n$$\n[X]_t = \\int_0^t \\frac{1 + \\cos(2s)}{2} \\, ds\n$$\nWe can split the integral:\n$$\n[X]_t = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^t 1 \\, ds + \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^t \\cos(2s) \\, ds\n$$\nEvaluating each term:\n$$\n\\int_0^t 1 \\, ds = [s]_0^t = t\n$$\n$$\n\\int_0^t \\cos(2s) \\, ds = \\left[ \\frac{\\sin(2s)}{2} \\right]_0^t = \\frac{\\sin(2t)}{2} - \\frac{\\sin(0)}{2} = \\frac{\\sin(2t)}{2}\n$$\nCombining these results, the quadratic variation of $X_t$ is:\n$$\n[X]_t = \\frac{1}{2} (t) + \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\sin(2t)}{2} \\right) = \\frac{t}{2} + \\frac{\\sin(2t)}{4}\n$$\nThis is the explicit expression for the quadratic variation of $X_t$ as a function of $t$.\n\nNext, we must determine if $X_t$ is a Brownian motion. For this, we use Lévy's characterization of Brownian motion. The theorem states that a continuous local martingale $(M_t)_{t \\geq 0}$ defined on the filtered probability space, with $M_0 = 0$, is a standard Brownian motion with respect to the filtration $(\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t \\geq 0}$ if and only if its quadratic variation is $[M]_t = t$ for all $t \\geq 0$.\n\nLet's check if our process $X_t$ satisfies the conditions of this theorem.\n1.  **Starting value:** $X_0 = \\int_0^0 \\cos(s) \\, dB_s = 0$. This condition is met.\n2.  **Continuity:** Since the integrand $\\cos(s)$ is a continuous function, the Itô integral $X_t = \\int_0^t \\cos(s) \\, dB_s$ defines a process with continuous sample paths (almost surely). This condition is met.\n3.  **Martingale property:** The integrand $H_s=\\cos(s)$ is a deterministic and bounded function. Therefore, it satisfies the condition $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_0^t H_s^2 \\, ds\\right] \\lt \\infty$ for all $t \\ge 0$. This ensures that $X_t$ is not just a local martingale, but a true martingale. This condition is met.\n\nNow we check the final and crucial condition from Lévy's theorem: whether the quadratic variation is equal to $t$.\nFrom our earlier calculation, we found that:\n$$\n[X]_t = \\frac{t}{2} + \\frac{\\sin(2t)}{4}\n$$\nFor $X_t$ to be a standard Brownian motion, its quadratic variation must be $[X]_t = t$. Comparing our result with this requirement, we see that:\n$$\n\\frac{t}{2} + \\frac{\\sin(2t)}{4} \\neq t\n$$\nfor almost all $t \\gt 0$. For instance, for $t=\\pi$, we have $[X]_{\\pi} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{\\sin(2\\pi)}{4} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, which is not equal to $\\pi$. Since the quadratic variation of $X_t$ is not equal to $t$, the process $X_t$ is not a standard Brownian motion.\n\nTherefore, the indicator variable $\\mathbf{b}$ is $0$.\n\nThe final answer is the row matrix comprised of the expression for the quadratic variation and the value of $\\mathbf{b}$.\nThe quadratic variation is $[X]_t = \\frac{t}{2} + \\frac{\\sin(2t)}{4}$.\nThe indicator for being a Brownian motion is $\\mathbf{b} = 0$.\nThe resulting row matrix is $\\left( \\frac{t}{2} + \\frac{\\sin(2t)}{4}, 0 \\right)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{t}{2} + \\frac{\\sin(2t)}{4} & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "3063527"}, {"introduction": "Lévy's theorem requires the quadratic variation $[M]_t$ to equal $t$ almost surely—a path-by-path identity.

The concepts of continuous martingales, quadratic variation, and Lévy's characterization are well-defined and central to the theory of stochastic processes. The given conditions—continuity, the martingale property, $M_0=0$, and $\\mathbb{E}[M_t^2] = t$—are self-consistent and represent a standard setup for investigating properties of stochastic processes.

The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains no ambiguities or contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous derivation and evaluation of the options may proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Answer\n\nThe core of this problem lies in understanding the precise requirements of Lévy’s characterization of Brownian motion and how they relate to the properties of square-integrable martingales.\n\n1.  **Lévy's Characterization of Brownian Motion**: The theorem states that a continuous local martingale $\\{M_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ with $M_0=0$ is a standard Brownian motion if and only if its quadratic variation process $\\{[M]_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ is identically equal to the time parameter $t$. That is, we must have:\n    $$ [M]_t = t, \\quad \\text{for all } t \\ge 0, \\text{ almost surely.} $$\n    It is crucial to recognize that this is a **pathwise** condition. For almost every realization $\\omega$ of the underlying probability space, the function $t \\mapsto [M]_t(\\omega)$ must be identical to the function $t \\mapsto t$.\n\n2.  **Quadratic Variation and the Second Moment**: For a continuous square-integrable martingale $\\{M_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ with $M_0=0$, there is a fundamental identity connecting its second moment to its quadratic variation. The process $\\{M_t^2 - [M]_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ is a martingale. Since $M_0=0$ and $[M]_0=0$ by definition, we have:\n    $$ \\mathbb{E}[M_t^2 - [M]_t] = \\mathbb{E}[M_0^2 - [M]_0] = 0 $$\n    This directly implies:\n    $$ \\mathbb{E}[M_t^2] = \\mathbb{E}[[M]_t] $$\n    This result is a form of Itō's isometry.\n\n3.  **Analysis of the Problem Condition**: The problem provides the condition $\\mathbb{E}[M_t^2] = t$. Applying the identity from step 2, we can conclude that:\n    $$ \\mathbb{E}[[M]_t] = t $$\n    This means that the *expected value* of the quadratic variation at time $t$ is equal to $t$.\n\n4.  **Comparison**: Lévy's characterization requires $[M]_t = t$ almost surely. The given condition only allows us to deduce that $\\mathbb{E}[[M]_t] = t$. The question thus reduces to whether knowing the expectation of a random variable is sufficient to determine the random variable itself.\n    For a non-negative random variable $X$, the condition $\\mathbb{E}[X] = c$ does not, in general, imply that $X=c$ almost surely. The equality holds if and only if the variance of $X$ is zero, i.e., $\\text{Var}(X) = 0$. In our case, for each fixed $t \\gt 0$, $[M]_t$ is a non-negative random variable. The condition $\\mathbb{E}[[M]_t] = t$ does not preclude $[M]_t$ from having a non-zero variance. It is possible for $[M]_t$ to be a random variable with mean $t$, but whose value for any specific sample path is not $t$.\n    \n    For $\\{M_t\\}$ to be a standard Brownian motion, we need $[M]_t$ to be the deterministic function $f(t)=t$. The given information only fixes the mean of the random process $[M]_t$, not the process itself. Therefore, the condition $\\mathbb{E}[M_t^2] = t$ is insufficient to conclude that $M$ is a standard Brownian motion.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The condition $\\mathbb{E}[M_t^2] = t$ implies $[M]_t = t$ almost surely, so by Lévy’s characterization $M$ is a standard Brownian motion.**\nThis statement is founded on a false premise. As demonstrated above, $\\mathbb{E}[M_t^2] = t$ implies $\\mathbb{E}[[M]_t] = t$, which does NOT imply $[M]_t = t$ almost surely. The expectation of a random variable does not determine its value.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. The condition $\\mathbb{E}[M_t^2] = t$ ensures $\\mathbb{E}([M]_t) = t$ but does not force $[M]_t = t$ almost surely; Lévy’s characterization requires the stronger pathwise identity $[M]_t = t$.**\nThis statement is perfectly accurate. It correctly states that the given condition implies $\\mathbb{E}[[M]_t] = t$. It correctly identifies that this is not sufficient to conclude $[M]_t = t$ a.s., because the expectation does not determine the random variable. It also correctly states the precise pathwise requirement of Lévy's characterization. This is a complete and correct analysis of the situation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Since $\\mathbb{E}[M_t^2] = t$, the distribution of $M_t$ must be Gaussian with variance $t$, hence $M$ is Brownian by Lévy’s characterization.**\nThis statement contains two errors. First, knowing the second moment, $\\mathbb{E}[M_t^2] = t$, is not sufficient to determine the entire distribution of the random variable $M_t$. There exist infinitely many non-Gaussian distributions with the same second moment. Second, even if $M_t$ were known to be Gaussian for each $t$, this would not be sufficient to prove that the process $\\{M_t\\}$ is a Brownian motion. A Brownian motion is a Gaussian process, which is a much stronger condition concerning the joint distribution of $(M_{t_1}, M_{t_2}, \\dots, M_{t_n})$ for any collection of times.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Continuity, the martingale property, and $\\mathbb{E}[M_t^2] = t$ are sufficient for $M$ to be Brownian; the quadratic variation $[M]_t$ plays no role in Lévy’s characterization.**\nThis statement is incorrect. As established, the conditions are insufficient. Furthermore, the claim that \"[M]_t$ plays no role in Lévy’s characterization\" is a direct contradiction of the theorem itself. Lévy's characterization is precisely a statement *about* the quadratic variation of a continuous local martingale.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. If $[M]_t$ is deterministic, then $M$ is a time-change of Brownian motion; moreover $\\mathbb{E}[M_t^2]=t$ forces $[M]_t$ to equal $t$ deterministically, so $M$ is a standard Brownian motion.**\nThe first part of the statement is related to the Dambis-Dubins-Schwarz theorem and is correct: if $[M]_t = f(t)$ for a deterministic, continuous, strictly increasing function $f$, then $M$ is a time-changed Brownian motion. The second part, however, is fallacious. The condition $\\mathbb{E}[M_t^2]=t$ does not force $[M]_t$ to be deterministic. It only implies $\\mathbb{E}[[M]_t]=t$. The argument incorrectly assumes that $[M]_t$ is deterministic to conclude that it must be equal to $t$. The premise of the argument does not provide any grounds for assuming $[M]_t$ is deterministic.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "3063559"}, {"introduction": "We have seen that a process can fail to be a Brownian motion if its quadratic variation is not equal to $t$.

The submartingale condition is automatically satisfied and does not suggest any drift.\n\nB. Lévy’s characterization fails because $X$ is not a martingale even though $[X]_t = t$. Writing $X_t^2 - t$ via Itô’s formula reveals a finite variation term $2\\int_0^t X_s b(s,X_s)\\,ds$; the submartingale property requires this term to be nonnegative in conditional expectation, suggesting a drift that tends to push the process away from zero (so that, in expectation, $X_s b(s,X_s) \\ge 0$), and hence $b \\not\\equiv 0$.\n\nC. The submartingale property of $X_t^2 - t$ necessarily arises from having $[X]_t > t$ (i.e., a diffusion coefficient larger than $1$) with $b \\equiv 0$, so the failure of Lévy’s characterization is entirely due to the quadratic variation being different from $t$.\n\nD.

This would require $b \\equiv 0$.\n    - However, from step 4, we concluded that $b \\not\\equiv 0$.\n    - Therefore, $X$ is not a local martingale.\n    - Conclusion: Lévy's characterization fails for $X$ because, despite having the correct quadratic variation $[X]_t=t$, it is not a local martingale due to the presence of a non-zero drift $b$.\n\n6.  **Interpret the Drift Condition:**\n    The submartingale property requires $A_t$ to be non-decreasing, which implies $X_s b(s,X_s) \\ge 0$. Let's analyze this condition:\n    - If $X_s \\gt 0$, then $b(s,X_s) \\ge 0$. The drift pushes the process to larger positive values.\n    - If $X_s \\lt 0$, then $b(s,X_s) \\le 0$. The drift pushes the process to larger negative values.\n    In both cases, the drift acts to push the process away from the origin. This increases the expected squared value of the process compared to a standard Brownian motion, which is consistent with $X_t^2 - t$ being a submartingale rather than a martingale.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $X$ must be standard Brownian motion; in particular, $b \\equiv 0$, so $X_t^2 - t$ is a martingale. The submartingale condition is automatically satisfied and does not suggest any drift.**\nThis statement is incorrect. It directly contradicts the given information that $X_t^2 - t$ is *not* a martingale. If $X_t$ were a standard Brownian motion, $X_t^2 - t$ would be a classic example of a martingale.\n\n**B. Lévy’s characterization fails because $X$ is not a martingale even though $[X]_t = t$. Writing $X_t^2 - t$ via Itô’s formula reveals a finite variation term $2\\int_0^t X_s b(s,X_s)\\,ds$; the submartingale property requires this term to be nonnegative in conditional expectation, suggesting a drift that tends to push the process away from zero (so that, in expectation, $X_s b(s,X_s) \\ge 0$), and hence $b \\not\\equiv 0$.**\nThis statement accurately summarizes the entire derivation.\n- It correctly identifies that the failure of Lévy's characterization stems from $X$ not being a martingale, a consequence of the non-zero drift $b$.\n- It correctly identifies the finite variation term $A_t = \\int_0^t 2X_s b(s,X_s)\\,ds$ from the Itô expansion of $X_t^2 - t$.\n- It correctly links the submartingale property to the non-decreasing nature of this finite variation term (or its non-negative conditional expectation).\n- It correctly interprets the resulting condition on the drift ($X_s b(s,X_s) \\ge 0$) as a force pushing the process away from zero.\n- It correctly concludes that $b \\not\\equiv 0$ is a necessary condition.\nThis option is correct.\n\n**C. The submartingale property of $X_t^2 - t$ necessarily arises from having $[X]_t > t$ (i.e., a diffusion coefficient larger than $1$) with $b \\equiv 0$, so the failure of Lévy’s characterization is entirely due to the quadratic variation being different from $t$.**\nThis statement is incorrect. It contradicts the premise that $[X]_t = t$. The problem is explicitly constructed such that the quadratic variation matches that of a Brownian motion, isolating the effect of the drift term.\n\n**D. The process must be a deterministic time-change of Brownian motion with no drift; the submartingale property of $X_t^2 - t$ is explained by the time-change alone, and the characterization fails because of a mismatch in filtration, not because of drift.**\nThis statement is incorrect. A process with a non-zero drift ($b \\not\\equiv 0$) is fundamentally different from a time-changed Brownian motion (which has no drift term in its SDE representation, see Dubins-Schwarz theorem). The failure of Lévy's characterization is directly due to the drift component, which prevents the process from being a local martingale.\n\n**E. The failure of Lévy’s characterization is explained by the presence of jumps in $X$, and the submartingale property of $X_t^2 - t$ signals a jump-driven increase in quadratic variation.**\nThis statement is incorrect. It contradicts the explicit premise that the process $X$ is *continuous*. The analysis is entirely within the realm of continuous semimartingales.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "3063535"}]}
