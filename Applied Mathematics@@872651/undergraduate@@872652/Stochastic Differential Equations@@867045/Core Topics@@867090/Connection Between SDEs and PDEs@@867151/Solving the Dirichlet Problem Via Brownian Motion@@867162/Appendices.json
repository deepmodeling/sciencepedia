This can be seen as a specific case from Itô's formula. For a twice-differentiable function $g(x)$, the process $g(B_t)$ is a local martingale if its drift term is zero. From Itô's formula, $d(g(B_t)) = g'(B_t) dB_t + \\frac{1}{2}g''(B_t) dt$. For the drift to be zero, we need $g''(x)=0$, which implies $g(x)=c_1 x + c_2$ for constants $c_1, c_2$. Choosing $c_1=1$ and $c_2=0$ shows that $M_t^{(1)} = B_t$ is a (local) martingale. Since $\\mathbb{E}[|B_t|]  \\infty$, it is a true martingale.\n- Another important martingale is $M_t^{(2)} = B_t^2 - t$. Applying Itô's formula to $g(t,x)=x^2-t$ gives $d(B_t^2-t) = \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial t}dt + \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}dB_t + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial x^2}dt = -1 dt + 2B_t dB_t + \\frac{1}{2}(2)dt = 2B_t dB_t$. Since the drift term is zero, $\\{B_t^2-t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ is a local martingale, and it can be shown to be a true martingale.\n\nWe will use the first martingale, $M_t = B_t$, to solve the problem as instructed.\n\n**Step 2: Justify and Apply the Optional Stopping Theorem (OST)**\nThe Optional Stopping Theorem states that for a martingale $\\{M_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ and a stopping time $\\tau$, under certain conditions, $\\mathbb{E}[M_\\tau] = \\mathbb{E}[M_0]$. We apply this theorem to the martingale $M_t = B_t$ and the first exit time $\\tau$ from $(0,a)$.\n\nTo apply the OST, we need to verify its conditions. One widely used set of sufficient conditions is:\n1. $\\mathbb{P}(\\tau  \\infty) = 1$.\n2. The stopped process $\\{M_{t \\wedge \\tau}\\}_{t \\geq 0}$ is uniformly integrable.\n\nFor a one-dimensional Brownian motion starting inside a finite interval, it is a standard result that the process will exit the interval in finite time with probability $1$. Thus, $\\mathbb{P}_x(\\tau  \\infty) = 1$.\n\nA sufficient condition for uniform integrability is that the stopped process is bounded. Let us examine the stopped process $M_{t \\wedge \\tau} = B_{t \\wedge \\tau}$. By definition of the stopping time $\\tau$, for any time $s \\leq \\tau$, the process $B_s$ is within the interval $[0,a]$. Since $t \\wedge \\tau \\leq \\tau$, the value of the process at this time, $B_{t \\wedge \\tau}$, must lie in the closed interval $[0,a]$. Therefore, $|B_{t \\wedge \\tau}| \\leq a$ for all $t \\geq 0$. The stopped process is bounded, which implies it is uniformly integrable.\n\nBoth conditions are met, so we can apply the OST to the martingale $M_t = B_t$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_x[B_\\tau] = \\mathbb{E}_x[B_0]\n$$\nGiven the initial condition $B_0=x$, we have:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_x[B_\\tau] = x\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Compute $\\mathbb{P}_x(B_\\tau = a)$**\nBy the definition of $\\tau$, the process stops as soon as it leaves the open interval $(0,a)$. Since Brownian paths are continuous, at the moment of exit, $B_\\tau$ must be on the boundary $\\partial D = \\{0,a\\}$. So, the random variable $B_\\tau$ can only take two values: $0$ and $a$.\n\nLet $p_a(x) = \\mathbb{P}_x(B_\\tau = a)$. Then, the probability of exiting at the other end is $\\mathbb{P}_x(B_\\tau = 0) = 1 - p_a(x)$. We can express the expectation of $B_\\tau$ using these probabilities:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_x[B_\\tau] = a \\cdot \\mathbb{P}_x(B_\\tau = a) + 0 \\cdot \\mathbb{P}_x(B_\\tau = 0) = a \\cdot p_a(x)\n$$\nEquating this with the result from the OST in Step 2:\n$$\na \\cdot p_a(x) = x\n$$\nSolving for $p_a(x)$, we find the probability of the Brownian motion exiting at $a$:\n$$\np_a(x) = \\mathbb{P}_x(B_\\tau = a) = \\frac{x}{a}\n$$\n\n**Step 4: Compute $u(x) = \\mathbb{E}_x[f(B_\\tau)]$**\nThe function to be determined is $u(x) = \\mathbb{E}_x[f(B_\\tau)]$, where the boundary function is $f(y) = y^2$.

This can be achieved by considering the evolution of $u(x)$ over a small time increment $h  0$.

This can be expressed as:\n$$\nu(x) = h + \\mathbb{E}_{x}[\\mathbb{E}_{B_h}[\\tau_{D}]] = h + \\mathbb{E}_{x}[u(B_h)]\n$$\nThis relationship holds under the assumption that the process has not exited the domain in the time interval $[0, h]$.

Thus, $u(x) = \\mathbb{E}_x[0] = 0$ for $x \\in \\partial D$.\n\nTo derive the partial differential equation, let us assume there exists a unique solution $v(x) \\in C^2(D) \\cap C(\\bar{D})$ to the boundary value problem:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{1}{2}\\Delta v(x) = -1  \\text{for } x \\in D \\\\\nv(x) = 0  \\text{for } x \\in \\partial D\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nWe apply Itô's formula to the process $v(B_t)$.

The problem is equivalent to solving $\\Delta u(x) = -2$ in $D$ with boundary condition $u(x)=0$ on $\\partial D$.\n\n**Part 2: Finiteness of $u(x)$**\n\nThe boundary value problem derived above is a standard Poisson equation on a bounded domain $D$ with a $C^2$ boundary $\\partial D$ and a Dirichlet boundary condition. From the theory of elliptic partial differential equations, it is known that for a smooth-enough domain and continuous data, such a problem admits a unique solution $u(x)$ that belongs to the class $C^2(D) \\cap C(\\bar{D})$.\nA function that is continuous on a compact set (here, the closure $\\bar{D}$) must be bounded. Therefore, $u(x)$ must be finite for all $x \\in \\bar{D}$.\n\n**Part 3: Solution for the Ball $D = B(0,R)$**\n\nWe now solve the specific problem where the domain is a $d$-dimensional ball of radius $R$ centered at the origin: $D = B(0,R) = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d : |x|  R\\}$. The BVP is:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\Delta u(x) = -2  \\text{for } |x|  R \\\\\nu(x) = 0  \\text{for } |x| = R\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nGiven the spherical symmetry of the domain and the boundary condition, the solution $u(x)$ must depend only on the radial distance $r = |x|$. We thus seek a solution of the form $u(x) = f(r)$.\nThe Laplacian operator in $d$-dimensional spherical coordinates acting on a radial function $f(r)$ is:\n$$\\Delta u = f''(r) + \\frac{d-1}{r}f'(r)$$\nThe PDE becomes an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $f(r)$:\n$$f''(r) + \\frac{d-1}{r}f'(r) = -2, \\quad \\text{for } 0 \\leq r  R$$\nThe boundary condition is $f(R) = 0$. Furthermore, for the solution $u(x)$ to be smooth (specifically $C^2$) at the origin, its gradient must be zero at $x=0$, which implies $f'(0) = 0$. This prevents the term $\\frac{d-1}{r}f'(r)$ from being singular at $r=0$ for $d1$.\n\nLet $g(r) = f'(r)$. The ODE becomes a first-order linear equation for $g(r)$:\n$$g'(r) + \\frac{d-1}{r}g(r) = -2$$\nThe integrating factor is $I(r) = \\exp\\left(\\int \\frac{d-1}{r} dr\\right) = \\exp((d-1)\\ln r) = r^{d-1}$.\nMultiplying the ODE by the integrating factor gives:\n$$r^{d-1}g'(r) + (d-1)r^{d-2}g(r) = -2r^{d-1}$$\nThe left-hand side is the derivative of a product:\n$$\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r^{d-1}g(r)\\right) = -2r^{d-1}$$\nIntegrating with respect to $r$:\n$$r^{d-1}g(r) = \\int -2r^{d-1} dr = -2\\frac{r^d}{d} + C_1$$\nwhere $C_1$ is a constant of integration. Solving for $g(r)$:\n$$g(r) = f'(r) = -\\frac{2r}{d} + C_1r^{1-d}$$\nApplying the regularity condition $f'(0)=0$. For $d \\ge 2$, the term $C_1r^{1-d}$ is singular as $r \\to 0$ unless $C_1=0$. For $d=1$, $f'(r) = -2r+C_1$, and $f'(0)=C_1=0$. In all cases, we must have $C_1=0$.\nThis simplifies the derivative to:\n$$f'(r) = -\\frac{2r}{d}$$\nIntegrating $f'(r)$ to find $f(r)$:\n$$f(r) = \\int -\\frac{2r}{d} dr = -\\frac{r^2}{d} + C_2$$\nwhere $C_2$ is the second integration constant. We determine $C_2$ using the boundary condition $f(R)=0$:\n$$0 = f(R) = -\\frac{R^2}{d} + C_2 \\implies C_2 = \\frac{R^2}{d}$$\nSubstituting $C_2$ back, we obtain the expression for $f(r)$:\n$$f(r) = \\frac{R^2}{d} - \\frac{r^2}{d} = \\frac{R^2 - r^2}{d}$$\nSince $u(x) = f(|x|)$, the solution in terms of $x$ is:\n$$u(x) = \\frac{R^2 - |x|^2}{d}$$\nThis expression represents the mean first exit time from a $d$-dimensional ball of radius $R$ for a Brownian motion starting at position $x$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{R^2 - |x|^2}{d}}$$", "id": "3074767"}]}
