The process is described by the stochastic differential equation (SDE) $dX_t = dW_t$.\n\nFirst, we validate the problem statement.\nThe givens are:\n1.  The SDE for the process $X_t$: $dX_t = dW_t$.\n2.  The initial state: $X_0 = x \\in (a, b)$.\n3.  The domain: $D = (a,b)$, where $a  b$ are real constants.\n4.

It is a canonical problem in the theory of stochastic differential equations. All necessary information is provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities.
