We apply Itô's formula to $Y_t$:\n$$ \\mathrm{d}Y_t = \\varphi'(X_t)\\,\\mathrm{d}X_t + \\frac{1}{2}\\varphi''(X_t)\\,(\\mathrm{d}X_t)^2 $$\nThe quadratic variation term is $(\\mathrm{d}X_t)^2 = (b(X_t)\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t)^2 = b(X_t)^2\\,\\mathrm{d}t = (\\sigma X_t)^2\\,\\mathrm{d}t = \\sigma^2 X_t^2\\,\\mathrm{d}t$.\nSubstituting $\\mathrm{d}X_t$ and $(\\mathrm{d}X_t)^2$ into the Itô expansion for $\\mathrm{d}Y_t$:\n$$ \\mathrm{d}Y_t = \\varphi'(X_t) (\\kappa X_t\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma X_t\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t) + \\frac{1}{2}\\varphi''(X_t)(\\sigma^2 X_t^2)\\,\\mathrm{d}t $$\nGrouping the $\\mathrm{d}t$ and $\\mathrm{d}W_t$ terms:\n$$ \\mathrm{d}Y_t = \\left(\\kappa X_t \\varphi'(X_t) + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 X_t^2 \\varphi''(X_t)\\right)\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma X_t \\varphi'(X_t)\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t $$\nThe diffusion coefficient of the process $Y_t$ is $\\sigma X_t \\varphi'(X_t)$. The Lamperti transform requires this coefficient to be constant. For simplicity, we can set it equal to $\\sigma$:\n$$ \\sigma X_t \\varphi'(X_t) = \\sigma $$\nAs $\\sigma  0$ and $X_t  0$, we can simplify this to:\n$$ \\varphi'(x) = \\frac{1}{x} $$\nIntegrating with respect to $x$ gives the transformation function $\\varphi(x)$. We can choose the integration constant to be zero for simplicity.\n$$ \\varphi(x) = \\int \\frac{1}{x}\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\ln(x) $$\nSince $X_t$ is strictly positive, this transformation is well-defined.\n\n**Part 2: Derive and Solve the SDE for $Y_t$**\nWith $\\varphi(x) = \\ln(x)$, we have $\\varphi'(x) = 1/x$ and $\\varphi''(x) = -1/x^2$. Substituting these into the SDE for $Y_t$:\nThe drift term for $Y_t$ is:\n$$ \\mu_Y = \\kappa X_t \\varphi'(X_t) + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 X_t^2 \\varphi''(X_t) = \\kappa X_t \\left(\\frac{1}{X_t}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 X_t^2 \\left(-\\frac{1}{X_t^2}\\right) = \\kappa - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 $$\nThe diffusion term for $Y_t$ is, as constructed:\n$$ b_Y = \\sigma X_t \\varphi'(X_t) = \\sigma X_t \\left(\\frac{1}{X_t}\\right) = \\sigma $$\nThus, the SDE for $Y_t = \\ln(X_t)$ is:\n$$ \\mathrm{d}Y_t = \\left(\\kappa - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t $$\nThis is a linear SDE with constant coefficients, representing an arithmetic Brownian motion. We can solve it by direct integration from $s=0$ to $s=t$:\n$$ \\int_0^t \\mathrm{d}Y_s = \\int_0^t \\left(\\kappa - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)\\mathrm{d}s + \\int_0^t \\sigma\\,\\mathrm{d}W_s $$\n$$ Y_t - Y_0 = \\left(\\kappa - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)t + \\sigma(W_t - W_0) $$\nGiven $Y_0 = \\varphi(X_0) = \\ln(X_0)$ and the convention $W_0=0$, the explicit solution for $Y_t$ is:\n$$ Y_t = \\ln(X_0) + \\left(\\kappa - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)t + \\sigma W_t $$\nThis shows that $Y_t$ is a normally distributed random variable with mean $\\mathbb{E}[Y_t] = \\ln(X_0) + (\\kappa - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)t$ and variance $\\mathrm{Var}(Y_t) = \\mathbb{E}[(\\sigma W_t)^2] = \\sigma^2 t$.\n\n**Part 3: Compute the Moment $\\mathbb{E}[X_t^p]$**\nTo find the moments of $X_t$, we first express $X_t$ in terms of $Y_t$ using the inverse transform. Since $Y_t = \\ln(X_t)$, we have $X_t = \\exp(Y_t)$.\nSubstituting the solution for $Y_t$:\n$$ X_t = \\exp\\left(\\ln(X_0) + \\left(\\kappa - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)t + \\sigma W_t\\right) = X_0 \\exp\\left(\\left(\\kappa - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)t + \\sigma W_t\\right) $$\nNow, we compute the $p$-th moment, $\\mathbb{E}[X_t^p]$, for an arbitrary $p \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[X_t^p] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(X_0 \\exp\\left(\\left(\\kappa - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)t + \\sigma W_t\\right)\\right)^p\\right] $$\nSince $X_0$ is a deterministic initial condition, we can write:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[X_t^p] = X_0^p \\, \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\exp\\left(p\\left(\\kappa - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)t + p\\sigma W_t\\right)\\right] $$\nThe term $\\exp\\left(p(\\kappa - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)t\\right)$ is also deterministic and can be factored out of the expectation:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[X_t^p] = X_0^p \\exp\\left(p\\left(\\kappa - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)t\\right) \\, \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\exp\\left(p\\sigma W_t\\right)\\right] $$\nThe remaining expectation is the moment-generating function (MGF) of the random variable $\\sigma W_t$ evaluated at $p$, or equivalently, the MGF of $W_t$ evaluated at $p\\sigma$.\nWe know that $W_t$ is a normally distributed random variable, $W_t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, t)$.\nThe MGF of a general normal random variable $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, s^2)$ is $M_Z(u) = \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(uZ)] = \\exp\\left(\\mu u + \\frac{1}{2}s^2 u^2\\right)$.\nFor $W_t$, we have $\\mu=0$ and $s^2=t$. Applying this with $u = p\\sigma$:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\exp\\left(p\\sigma W_t\\right)\\right] = \\exp\\left(0 \\cdot (p\\sigma) + \\frac{1}{2}t(p\\sigma)^2\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2}p^2\\sigma^2 t\\right) $$\nThis MGF is finite for all $p \\in \\mathbb{R}$, so the moment $\\mathbb{E}[X_t^p]$ exists for all $p \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\mathbb{E}[X_t^p]$:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[X_t^p] = X_0^p \\exp\\left(p\\left(\\kappa - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)t\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{1}{2}p^2\\sigma^2 t\\right) $$\nCombining the exponents:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[X_t^p] = X_0^p \\exp\\left(p\\left(\\kappa - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)t + \\frac{1}{2}p^2\\sigma^2 t\\right) $$\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[X_t^p] = X_0^p \\exp\\left(\\left(p\\kappa - \\frac{1}{2}p\\sigma^2 + \\frac{1}{2}p^2\\sigma^2\\right)t\\right) $$\nFactoring terms within the exponent:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[X_t^p] = X_0^p \\exp\\left(\\left(p\\kappa + \\frac{1}{2}(p^2 - p)\\sigma^2\\right)t\\right) $$\nThis expression can be rewritten as:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[X_t^p] = X_0^p \\exp\\left(\\left(p\\kappa + \\frac{1}{2}p(p-1)\\sigma^2\\right)t\\right) $$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the $p$-th moment of $X_t$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{X_0^p \\exp\\left(\\left( p\\kappa + \\frac{1}{2}p(p-1)\\sigma^2 \\right)t\\right)} $$", "id": "3063353"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond the classic GBM, this practice explores a diffusion with a more complex state-dependent volatility.

An Itô SDE of the form $dX_t = a(X_t) \\, dt + b(X_t) \\, dW_t$ is equivalent to a Stratonovich SDE $dX_t = a_{\\mathrm{s}}(X_t) \\, dt + b(X_t) \\circ dW_t$, where the drifts are related by:\n$$a_{\\mathrm{s}}(X_t) = a(X_t) - \\frac{1}{2} b(X_t) \\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial x}(X_t)$$\nFor the given GBM, we have the Itô form $dX_t = \\mu X_t \\, dt + \\sigma X_t \\, dW_t$. The coefficients are $a(X_t) = \\mu X_t$ and $b(X_t) = \\sigma X_t$. The partial derivative of $b$ with respect to its state variable is:\n$$\\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial x}(X_t) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X_t} (\\sigma X_t) = \\sigma$$\nThe correction term is therefore:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} b(X_t) \\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial x}(X_t) = \\frac{1}{2} (\\sigma X_t) (\\sigma) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 X_t$$\nThe corresponding Stratonovich drift coefficient is:\n$$a_{\\mathrm{s}}(X_t) = \\mu X_t - \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 X_t = \\left(\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right) X_t$$\nThe problem specifies the Stratonovich SDE as $dX_t = \\mu_{\\mathrm{s}} X_t \\, dt + \\sigma X_t \\circ dW_t$. By comparing the drift terms, we must have $a_{\\mathrm{s}}(X_t) = \\mu_{\\mathrm{s}} X_t$. This yields the relationship:\n$$\\mu_{\\mathrm{s}} X_t = \\left(\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right) X_t$$\nSince $X_t  0$, we can conclude:\n$$\\mu_{\\mathrm{s}} = \\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2$$\nThis equation ensures that the Itô and Stratonovich SDEs describe the same underlying stochastic process.\n\n**Part 2: Lamperti Transform in Itô Calculus**\n\nThe Lamperti transform aims to find a function $Y_t = \\psi(X_t)$ such that the resulting SDE for $Y_t$ has a diffusion coefficient of $1$. We start with the Itô SDE for $X_t$:\n$$dX_t = \\mu X_t \\, dt + \\sigma X_t \\, dW_t$$\nLet's apply Itô's lemma to $Y_t = \\psi(X_t)$. The general formula is:\n$$dY_t = \\psi'(X_t) \\, dX_t + \\frac{1}{2} \\psi''(X_t) (dX_t)^2$$\nThe quadratic variation term $(dX_t)^2$ is calculated using the Itô rules $(dt)^2 = 0$, $dt \\, dW_t = 0$, and $(dW_t)^2 = dt$:\n$$(dX_t)^2 = (\\mu X_t \\, dt + \\sigma X_t \\, dW_t)^2 = (\\sigma X_t)^2 (dW_t)^2 = \\sigma^2 X_t^2 \\, dt$$\nSubstituting $dX_t$ and $(dX_t)^2$ into the formula for $dY_t$:\n$$dY_t = \\psi'(X_t) (\\mu X_t \\, dt + \\sigma X_t \\, dW_t) + \\frac{1}{2} \\psi''(X_t) (\\sigma^2 X_t^2 \\, dt)$$\nRearranging terms into a drift part (proportional to $dt$) and a diffusion part (proportional to $dW_t$):\n$$dY_t = \\left[ \\mu X_t \\psi'(X_t) + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 X_t^2 \\psi''(X_t) \\right] dt + \\left[ \\sigma X_t \\psi'(X_t) \\right] dW_t$$\nThe new diffusion coefficient is $\\sigma X_t \\psi'(X_t)$. To make this equal to unity, we must choose $\\psi(x)$ such that:\n$$\\sigma x \\psi'(x) = 1 \\implies \\psi'(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma x}$$\nIntegrating with respect to $x$ to find $\\psi(x)$, and setting the integration constant to zero for simplicity (it would only add a constant to $Y_t$):\n$$\\psi(x) = \\int \\frac{1}{\\sigma x} \\, dx = \\frac{1}{\\sigma} \\ln(x)$$\nNow we find the second derivative, $\\psi''(x)$:\n$$\\psi''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sigma x}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{\\sigma x^2}$$\nSubstituting $\\psi'(X_t) = 1/(\\sigma X_t)$ and $\\psi''(X_t) = -1/(\\sigma X_t^2)$ into the drift term of the SDE for $Y_t$:\n$$\\text{Drift}_Y = \\mu X_t \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sigma X_t}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2} \\sigma^2 X_t^2 \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\sigma X_t^2}\\right)$$\n$$\\text{Drift}_Y = \\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma} - \\frac{\\sigma}{2}$$\nThe SDE for $Y_t$ under the Itô interpretation is therefore:\n$$dY_t = \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma} - \\frac{\\sigma}{2}\\right) dt + 1 \\cdot dW_t$$\nThe drift is $(\\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma} - \\frac{\\sigma}{2})$ and the diffusion coefficient is $1$, as required.\n\n**Part 3: Lamperti Transform in Stratonovich Calculus and Consistency Check**\n\nWe now apply the same transformation $Y_t = \\psi(X_t) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma} \\ln(X_t)$ to the Stratonovich SDE for $X_t$:\n$$dX_t = \\mu_{\\mathrm{s}} X_t \\, dt + \\sigma X_t \\circ dW_t$$\nA key property of Stratonovich calculus is that its change-of-variable formula follows the ordinary chain rule. For $Y_t = \\psi(X_t)$, we have:\n$$dY_t = \\psi'(X_t) \\circ dX_t$$\nSubstituting the expression for $dX_t$:\n$$dY_t = \\psi'(X_t) \\circ (\\mu_{\\mathrm{s}} X_t \\, dt + \\sigma X_t \\circ dW_t)$$\nSince $\\psi'(X_t)$ and $\\mu_{\\mathrm{s}}X_t$ are functions of $X_t$ and the $dt$ term is of bounded variation, the composition $\\circ$ with $dt$ behaves like ordinary multiplication. We also use the linearity of the Stratonovich integral.\n$$dY_t = (\\psi'(X_t) \\mu_{\\mathrm{s}} X_t) \\, dt + \\psi'(X_t) \\circ (\\sigma X_t \\circ dW_t)$$\nUsing the associativity-like property $f(X_t) \\circ (g(X_t) \\circ dW_t) = (f(X_t) g(X_t)) \\circ dW_t$, we get:\n$$dY_t = (\\psi'(X_t) \\mu_{\\mathrm{s}} X_t) \\, dt + (\\psi'(X_t) \\sigma X_t) \\circ dW_t$$\nNow, substitute $\\psi'(x) = 1/(\\sigma x)$:\n$$dY_t = \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sigma X_t} \\cdot \\mu_{\\mathrm{s}} X_t\\right) dt + \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sigma X_t} \\cdot \\sigma X_t\\right) \\circ dW_t$$\n$$dY_t = \\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{s}}}{\\sigma} dt + 1 \\circ dW_t$$\nThis is the SDE for $Y_t$ in Stratonovich form. The diffusion coefficient is indeed $1$. To check for consistency with the Itô result, we must convert this Stratonovich SDE for $Y_t$ back to its Itô equivalent. Let the Stratonovich SDE be $dY_t = \\alpha_{\\mathrm{s}}(Y_t) \\, dt + \\beta(Y_t) \\circ dW_t$, where $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{s}}(Y_t) = \\mu_{\\mathrm{s}}/\\sigma$ and $\\beta(Y_t) = 1$. The formula for the Itô drift $\\alpha(Y_t)$ is:\n$$\\alpha(Y_t) = \\alpha_{\\mathrm{s}}(Y_t) + \\frac{1}{2} \\beta(Y_t) \\frac{\\partial \\beta}{\\partial y}(Y_t)$$\nIn our case, $\\beta(Y_t) = 1$ is a constant, so its derivative with respect to $y$ is zero: $\\frac{\\partial \\beta}{\\partial y} = 0$. The correction term vanishes. Thus, the Itô drift is equal to the Stratonovich drift:\n$$\\alpha(Y_t) = \\alpha_{\\mathrm{s}}(Y_t) = \\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{s}}}{\\sigma}$$\nThe Itô SDE for $Y_t$ derived from the Stratonovich path is:\n$$dY_t = \\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{s}}}{\\sigma} dt + 1 \\cdot dW_t$$\nFinally, we substitute the relationship $\\mu_{\\mathrm{s}} = \\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2$ from Part 1 into this drift expression:\n$$\\text{Drift}_Y = \\frac{\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2}{\\sigma} = \\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma} - \\frac{\\sigma}{2}$$\nThis result is identical to the drift obtained in Part 2 using Itô calculus directly. Both interpretations consistently lead to the same Itô SDE for the transformed process $Y_t$:\n$$dY_t = \\left(\\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma} - \\frac{\\sigma}{2}\\right) dt + dW_t$$\nThe common drift of the Lamperti-transformed process $Y_t$ is therefore $\\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma} - \\frac{\\sigma}{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\mu}{\\sigma} - \\frac{\\sigma}{2}}$$", "id": "3063359"}]}
