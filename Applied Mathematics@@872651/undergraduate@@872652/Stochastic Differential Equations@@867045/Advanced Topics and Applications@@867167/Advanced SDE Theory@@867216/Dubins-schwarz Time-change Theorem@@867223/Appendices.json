We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the computation of the predictable quadratic variation processes for two specific continuous martingales, $M_{t}$ and $N_{t}$, and to connect these results to the Dubins–Schwarz time-change theorem and the Itô isometry.\n\nLet $(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F},(\\mathcal{F}_{t})_{t\\ge 0},\\mathbb{P})$ be a filtered probability space supporting a standard one-dimensional Brownian motion $W=(W_{t})_{t\\ge 0}$. The martingales are defined as $M_{t}=W_{t}$ and $N_{t}=\\int_{0}^{t}\\sigma\\,dW_{s}$ for a constant $\\sigma\\in\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe predictable quadratic variation of a continuous local martingale $X$, denoted $\\langle X \\rangle_{t}$, is the unique, non-decreasing, predictable process starting at $0$ such that $X_{t}^{2} - \\langle X \\rangle_{t}$ is a continuous local martingale. For Itô processes of the form $dX_{t} = H_{t} dW_{t}$, where $H_{t}$ is a predictable process, the predictable quadratic variation is given by the formula:\n$$\n\\langle X \\rangle_{t} = \\int_{0}^{t} H_{s}^{2} ds\n$$\n\nWe apply this general result to the two martingales $M_{t}$ and $N_{t}$.\n\nFirst, consider $M_{t}=W_{t}$. This can be written in differential form as $dM_{t} = dW_{t}$, which is an Itô process with an integrand of $H_{t} = 1$. The process $H_{t}=1$ is constant and therefore predictable. Applying the formula for the predictable quadratic variation, we get:\n$$\n\\langle M \\rangle_{t} = \\int_{0}^{t} 1^{2} ds = \\int_{0}^{t} ds = t\n$$\nThus, the predictable quadratic variation of a standard Brownian motion is simply time, $\\langle W \\rangle_{t} = t$.\n\nSecond, consider $N_{t}=\\int_{0}^{t}\\sigma\\,dW_{s}$. This can be written in differential form as $dN_{t} = \\sigma\\,dW_{t}$. This is an Itô process with an integrand of $H_{t} = \\sigma$. Since $\\sigma$ is a constant, the process $H_{t}=\\sigma$ is predictable. Applying the formula for the predictable quadratic variation yields:\n$$\n\\langle N \\rangle_{t} = \\int_{0}^{t} \\sigma^{2} ds = \\sigma^{2} \\int_{0}^{t} ds = \\sigma^{2} t\n$$\nSo, the predictable quadratic variation of the scaled Brownian motion is $\\sigma^{2}t$.\n\nNow, we connect these results to the Dubins–Schwarz theorem. The theorem states that any continuous local martingale $X$ (with $X_{0}=0$ and $\\langle X \\rangle_{\\infty}=\\infty$) can be represented as a time-changed Brownian motion. Specifically, there exists a standard Brownian motion $B$ such that $X_{t} = B_{\\langle X \\rangle_{t}}$ for all $t \\ge 0$. The process $\\langle X \\rangle_{t}$ serves as the new \"clock\" for the underlying Brownian motion.\n\nFor $M_{t} = W_{t}$, we found $\\langle M \\rangle_{t} = t$. The Dubins–Schwarz theorem implies $M_{t} = B_{\\langle M \\rangle_{t}} = B_{t}$ for some standard Brownian motion $B$. This is trivially satisfied by letting $B_{t}=W_{t}$. The clock for $M_{t}$ is the standard clock $t$, which is expected as $M_{t}$ is itself a standard Brownian motion.\n\nFor $N_{t} = \\int_{0}^{t}\\sigma\\,dW_{s}$, we found $\\langle N \\rangle_{t} = \\sigma^{2}t$. The Dubins–Schwarz theorem asserts the existence of a standard Brownian motion $B$ such that $N_{t} = B_{\\langle N \\rangle_{t}} = B_{\\sigma^{2}t}$. This reveals that the process $N_{t}$ is a standard Brownian motion run on a clock that proceeds at a rate of $\\sigma^{2}$ relative to the calendar time $t$. If $|\\sigma|1$, the clock runs faster; if $|\\sigma|1$, it runs slower. If $\\sigma=0$, the clock stops, $\\langle N \\rangle_{t}=0$, and $N_t = B_0 = 0$ for all $t$.\n\nFinally, we reconcile these findings with the Itô isometry. The Itô isometry states that for a suitable predictable integrand process $H_{s}$, the second moment of the Itô integral is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\int_{0}^{t} H_{s} dW_{s}\\right)^{2}\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{t} H_{s}^{2} ds\\right]\n$$\nThis connects the $L^{2}$ norm of the random variable $\\int_{0}^{t} H_{s} dW_{s}$ to the $L^{2}$ norm of the integrand process $H$.\nA fundamental property relating the martingale $X_{t}^{2} - \\langle X \\rangle_{t}$ to expected values is that if $X$ is a martingale (not just a local martingale) with $X_0=0$ and $\\mathbb{E}[\\langle X \\rangle_t]  \\infty$, then $\\mathbb{E}[X_{t}^{2}] = \\mathbb{E}[\\langle X \\rangle_t]$.\n\nFor $M_{t}=W_{t} = \\int_{0}^{t} 1\\,dW_{s}$:\nUsing the Itô isometry with $H_{s}=1$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[M_{t}^{2}] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\int_{0}^{t} 1\\,dW_{s}\\right)^{2}\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{t} 1^{2}\\,ds\\right] = \\mathbb{E}[t] = t\n$$\nThis aligns with our result for the predictable quadratic variation, since $\\mathbb{E}[\\langle M \\rangle_{t}] = \\mathbb{E}[t] = t$.

The problem is thus deemed valid.\n\n### Step 2: Solution\n\nWe now proceed with the solution by addressing each part of the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we establish that the process $(M_{t})_{t \\ge 0}$ is a continuous local martingale. The process is defined by the Itô integral:\n$$\nM_{t} = \\int_{0}^{t} \\exp(-s)\\,\\mathrm{d}W_{s}\n$$\nThis is a stochastic integral of the form $M_{t} = \\int_{0}^{t} H_{s}\\,\\mathrm{d}W_{s}$, where the integrand is $H_{s} = \\exp(-s)$. For the Itô integral to be a continuous local martingale, the integrand process $(H_{s})_{s \\ge 0}$ must be adapted to the filtration $(\\mathcal{F}_{s})_{s \\ge 0}$ and must satisfy the condition $\\mathbb{P}\\left(\\int_{0}^{t} H_{s}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}s  \\infty\\right) = 1$ for all $t \\ge 0$.\n\nThe integrand $H_{s} = \\exp(-s)$ is a deterministic function of time $s$. A deterministic function is measurable with respect to the trivial $\\sigma$-algebra, which is a sub-$\\sigma$-algebra of $\\mathcal{F}_{0}$. Since the filtration $(\\mathcal{F}_{t})_{t \\ge 0}$ is increasing, $H_{s}$ is adapted to $(\\mathcal{F}_{s})_{s \\ge 0}$ for all $s \\ge 0$.\n\nNext, we check the integrability condition. We compute the integral of $H_{s}^{2}$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t} H_{s}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}s = \\int_{0}^{t} (\\exp(-s))^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}s = \\int_{0}^{t} \\exp(-2s)\\,\\mathrm{d}s\n$$\nThis integral evaluates to:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t} \\exp(-2s)\\,\\mathrm{d}s = \\left[ -\\frac{1}{2}\\exp(-2s) \\right]_{0}^{t} = -\\frac{1}{2}(\\exp(-2t) - \\exp(-2 \\cdot 0)) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\exp(-2t))\n$$\nFor any finite $t \\ge 0$, the value $\\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\exp(-2t))$ is a finite deterministic number. Thus, the condition $\\mathbb{P}\\left(\\int_{0}^{t} H_{s}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}s  \\infty\\right) = 1$ is satisfied. By the fundamental properties of the Itô integral, it follows that $(M_{t})_{t \\ge 0}$ is a continuous local martingale. Furthermore, since $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{t} H_{s}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}s\\right] = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\exp(-2t))  \\infty$, $(M_t)_{t\\ge 0}$ is in fact a true $L^{2}$-martingale, which is a stronger condition.\n\nSecond, we compute the quadratic variation process, $(\\langle M \\rangle_{t})_{t \\ge 0}$. For a continuous local martingale given by an Itô integral $M_{t} = \\int_{0}^{t} H_{s}\\,\\mathrm{d}W_{s}$, the quadratic variation is defined as:\n$$\n\\langle M \\rangle_{t} = \\int_{0}^{t} H_{s}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{d}s\n$$\nUsing our previously calculated integral, we have:\n$$\n\\langle M \\rangle_{t} = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\exp(-2t))\n$$\nTo determine if this process is bounded as $t \\to \\infty$, we compute its limit:\n$$\n\\langle M \\rangle_{\\infty} := \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\langle M \\rangle_{t} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\exp(-2t))\n$$\nSince $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\exp(-2t) = 0$, the limit is:\n$$\n\\langle M \\rangle_{\\infty} = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - 0) = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThe quadratic variation process $(\\langle M \\rangle_{t})_{t \\ge 0}$ is indeed bounded. For all $t \\ge 0$, we have $0 \\le \\langle M \\rangle_{t}  \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThird, we apply the Dambis–Dubins–Schwarz (DDS) time-change theorem. The theorem states that for any continuous local martingale $(M_{t})_{t \\ge 0}$ starting at $M_{0}=0$, there exists a standard Brownian motion $(B_{u})_{u \\ge 0}$ such that $M_{t} = B_{\\langle M \\rangle_{t}}$. The new time parameter $u$ for the process $B$ is given by the quadratic variation of $M$.\nThe relation $M_{t} = B_{\\langle M \\rangle_{t}}$ implies that the Brownian motion $B_{u}$ is sampled at times $u = \\langle M \\rangle_{t}$. The set of all such times, as $t$ spans $[0, \\infty)$, is the range of the process $(\\langle M \\rangle_{t})_{t \\ge 0}$.\n\nWe have found that $\\langle M \\rangle_{0} = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\exp(0)) = 0$ and $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\langle M \\rangle_{t} = \\frac{1}{2}$. Since $\\langle M \\rangle_{t}$ is a continuous and strictly increasing function of $t$, its range for $t \\in [0, \\infty)$ is the interval $[0, \\frac{1}{2})$.\nTherefore, the construction of the Brownian motion $(B_{u})$ via the DDS theorem defines it for time $u$ in this interval, i.e., for $u \\in [0, \\frac{1}{2})$. The time-changed process $B_{u} = M_{\\tau_u}$ (where $\\tau_u = \\inf\\{s \\ge 0: \\langle M \\rangle_s  u\\}$) is a standard Brownian motion on the time interval $[0, \\langle M \\rangle_\\infty)$.\n\nThe question asks for the finite deterministic time up to which the associated Brownian motion is defined. This corresponds to the supremum of the time interval over which the DDS construction naturally defines $B_u$. This supremum is $\\langle M \\rangle_{\\infty}$.\nThus, the finite deterministic time is given by the total accumulated quadratic variation:\n$$\n\\langle M \\rangle_{\\infty} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThe associated Brownian motion $(B_u)$ is a standard Brownian motion on the interval $[0, \\frac{1}{2})$. For times $u \\ge \\frac{1}{2}$, it can be thought of as a Brownian motion stopped at time $\\frac{1}{2}$. The problem asks to identify that stopping time.\n\nThe finite deterministic time is $\\frac{1}{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}$$", "id": "3050789"}, {"introduction": "A common point of confusion is the difference between the intrinsic time-change from the Dubins-Schwarz theorem and an externally imposed time substitution.

There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual unsoundness.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\n\nWe analyze the three parts of the question in order.\n\n**(i) Is $(M_t)_{t \\ge 0}$ a local martingale with respect to $(\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t \\ge 0}$?**\n\nFor a process to be a local martingale with respect to a filtration $(\\mathcal{G}_t)_{t \\ge 0}$, it must first be adapted to that filtration. That is, for every $t \\ge 0$, the random variable $M_t$ must be $\\mathcal{G}_t$-measurable.\n\nIn this problem, the process is $M_t = W_{t^2}$ and the filtration is $(\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t \\ge 0}$, where $\\mathcal{F}_t = \\sigma(W_s : 0 \\le s \\le t)$.\nWe must check if $M_t$ is $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable for all $t \\ge 0$.\n\n- For $0 \\le t \\le 1$, we have $t^2 \\le t$. In this case, $M_t = W_{t^2}$ is a function of the path of the Brownian motion up to time $t^2$. Since $t^2 \\le t$, the information required to determine $W_{t^2}$ is contained in $\\sigma(W_s : 0 \\le s \\le t) = \\mathcal{F}_t$. So, for $0 \\le t \\le 1$, $M_t$ is $\\mathcal{F}_t$-adapted.\n\n- For $t  1$, we have $t^2  t$. The random variable $M_t = W_{t^2}$ depends on the value of the Brownian motion at time $t^2$. The sigma-algebra $\\mathcal{F}_t$ only contains information about the path of the Brownian motion up to time $t$. Because the increments of a Brownian motion are independent, the increment $W_{t^2} - W_t$ is independent of the sigma-algebra $\\mathcal{F}_t$. Thus, $W_{t^2} = W_t + (W_{t^2} - W_t)$ is not $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable. The random variable $W_{t^2}$ contains information about the \"future\" relative to the information set $\\mathcal{F}_t$.\n\nSince $(M_t)_{t \\ge 0}$ is not adapted to the filtration $(\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t \\ge 0}$ for $t  1$, it cannot be a martingale or a local martingale with respect to $(\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t \\ge 0}$.\n\n**(ii) What is the quadratic variation $[M]_t$?**\n\nThe quadratic variation of a continuous process $(X_t)_{t \\ge 0}$ on the interval $[0,t]$ is defined as the limit in probability of the sum of squared increments over a sequence of partitions of $[0,t]$ whose mesh tends to zero.\nLet $\\Pi_n = \\{0 = t_0  t_1  \\cdots  t_k = t\\}$ be a partition of $[0,t]$. The quadratic variation is\n$$[M]_t = \\lim_{\\|\\Pi_n\\| \\to 0} \\sum_{i=1}^k (M_{t_i} - M_{t_{i-1}})^2$$\nSubstituting $M_t = W_{t^2}$, we get:\n$$[M]_t = \\lim_{\\|\\Pi_n\\| \\to 0} \\sum_{i=1}^k (W_{t_i^2} - W_{t_{i-1}^2})^2$$\nLet $u_i = t_i^2$. As the partition $\\{t_i\\}$ of $[0,t]$ becomes finer (i.e., $\\|\\Pi_n\\| \\to 0$), the set of points $\\{u_i = t_i^2\\}$ forms a partition of the interval $[0, t^2]$ whose mesh also tends to zero. The sum above is precisely the defining sum for the quadratic variation of the standard Brownian motion $(W_u)_{u \\ge 0}$ over the interval $[0, t^2]$.\nTherefore, the limit is the quadratic variation of $W$ evaluated at time $t^2$:\n$$[M]_t = [W]_{t^2}$$\nFor a standard Brownian motion, the quadratic variation is $[W]_u = u$. Applying this, we find:\n$$[M]_t = t^2$$\n\n**(iii) How does the DDS representation conceptually differ from the naive substitution $W_{t^2}$?**\n\nThe Dambis–Dubins–Schwarz (DDS) theorem is a representation theorem. It starts with a given continuous local martingale $(X_t)_{t \\ge 0}$ and states that it can be represented as a time-changed Brownian motion. Specifically, $X_t = B_{[X]_t}$ for all $t \\ge 0$, where $(B_t)_{t \\ge 0}$ is a standard Brownian motion (defined on the same probability space, possibly enlarged) and $[X]_t$ is the quadratic variation of $X_t$. The crucial point is that the time-change process, $[X]_t$, is an intrinsic property derived *from* the martingale $X_t$ itself. It is the \"internal clock\" of the martingale. This clock, $[X]_t$, is itself a continuous, non-decreasing, adapted process, and is generally random.\n\nIn contrast, the process $M_t = W_{t^2}$ is a *construction*. It starts with a given, fixed Brownian motion $(W_t)_{t \\ge 0}$ and applies an externally specified, deterministic time change $u(t) = t^2$. The direction of logic is reversed: instead of the process defining its clock (as in DDS), an external clock is imposed on a Brownian motion to define a new process.\n\nThe conceptual difference lies in the origin of the time-change process. In DDS, the time change is the quadratic variation, a quantity derived *from* the martingale. In the construction $M_t = W_{t^2}$, the time change $t^2$ is an external function used to *build* the process.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. $(M_t)_{t \\ge 0}$ is not a local martingale with respect to $(\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t \\ge 0}$ because it is not $\\mathcal{F}_t$-adapted for $t  1$; its quadratic variation is $[M]_t = t^2$; the Dambis–Dubins–Schwarz representation runs a Brownian motion at the random clock given by the quadratic variation of the local martingale, i.e., the time change acts on the local martingale through its own quadratic variation rather than by substituting $t^2$ into a fixed Brownian motion.**\n- **(i) Martingale property:** This is correct. The reason given (not being $\\mathcal{F}_t$-adapted for $t1$) is accurate.\n- **(ii) Quadratic variation:** This is correct, $[M]_t = t^2$.\n- **(iii) DDS concept:** This explanation is excellent. It correctly identifies that DDS derives the clock from the martingale, whereas the problem's construction imposes a clock on a Brownian motion.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $(M_t)_{t \\ge 0}$ is a local martingale with respect to $(\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t \\ge 0}$ because $(W_t)_{t \\ge 0}$ is a martingale; its quadratic variation is $[M]_t = t$; the Dambis–Dubins–Schwarz theorem says $M_t = W_t$ after reparametrization of $t$.**\n- **(i) Martingale property:** Incorrect. The process is not adapted. The reasoning is a non-sequitur.\n- **(ii) Quadratic variation:** Incorrect. The quadratic variation is $t^2$, not $t$.\n- **(iii) DDS concept:** The explanation is vague and uninformative.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. $(M_t)_{t \\ge 0}$ is $\\mathcal{F}_t$-adapted but fails to be a martingale because its increments are not stationary; its quadratic variation vanishes since $t^2$ is differentiable as a function of $t$; the Dambis–Dubins–Schwarz theorem asserts that $M_t = B_t$ for some Brownian motion $(B_t)_{t \\ge 0}$ independent of $(W_t)_{t \\ge 0}$.**\n- **(i) Martingale property:** Incorrect. The process is not $\\mathcal{F}_t$-adapted for all $t$.\n- **(ii) Quadratic variation:** Incorrect. The quadratic variation is $t^2$, it does not vanish. The reasoning confuses the quadratic variation of a stochastic process with the path-wise variation of a deterministic function.\n- **(iii) DDS concept:** Incorrect. The DDS theorem does not state equality to another BM, but equality to a time-changed BM. Independence is also not a general feature.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. $(M_t)_{t \\ge 0}$ is a semimartingale with respect to $(\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t \\ge 0}$ and satisfies $dM_t = \\sqrt{2t}\\, dW_t$; its quadratic variation is $[M]_t = \\int_0^t 2s\\, ds = t^2$; the Dambis–Dubins–Schwarz theorem expresses any semimartingale as a time-changed Brownian motion.**\n- **(i) Semimartingale property:** Incorrect. The process is not $(\\mathcal{F}_t)$-adapted, so it cannot be an $(\\mathcal{F}_t)$-semimartingale. The differential $dM_t = \\sqrt{2t} \\, dW_t$ is false; $M_t$ is not an Itô integral with respect to $W_t$.\n- **(ii) Quadratic variation:** The result $[M]_t = t^2$ is correct, but it is derived from the false premise $dM_t = \\sqrt{2t}\\, dW_t$. While $\\int_0^t (\\sqrt{2s})^2 ds = t^2$ gives the right answer, the premise is flawed.\n- **(iii) DDS concept:** Incorrect. The DDS theorem applies to continuous local martingales, not to all semimartingales.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "3050785"}]}
