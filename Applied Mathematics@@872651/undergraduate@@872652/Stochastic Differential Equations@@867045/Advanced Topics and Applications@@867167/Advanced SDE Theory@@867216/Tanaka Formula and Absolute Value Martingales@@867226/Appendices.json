Specifically, $x^2 + \\epsilon \\geq \\epsilon  0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The function $g(y) = \\sqrt{y}$ is infinitely differentiable ($C^{\\infty}$) for $y  0$. The function $h(x) = x^2 + \\epsilon$ is a polynomial and is therefore also infinitely differentiable on $\\mathbb{R}$. Since $f_{\\epsilon}(x) = g(h(x))$ is a composition of infinitely differentiable functions, $f_{\\epsilon}(x)$ is itself infinitely differentiable ($C^{\\infty}$) on $\\mathbb{R}$. A function that is $C^{\\infty}$ is necessarily twice continuously differentiable ($C^2$).\n\n    To establish strict convexity, we must show that the second derivative, $f_{\\epsilon}''(x)$, is strictly positive for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. We will compute this derivative in the next step and then refer back to its properties. As will be shown, $f_{\\epsilon}''(x) = \\epsilon (x^2 + \\epsilon)^{-3/2}$. Since $\\epsilon  0$ and $x^2 + \\epsilon$ is always positive, the denominator $(x^2 + \\epsilon)^{3/2}$ is also a positive real number. Consequently, $f_{\\epsilon}''(x)$ is strictly positive for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. A function with a strictly positive second derivative on its entire domain is strictly convex.\n\n2.  **Computation of Derivatives**\n    We compute the first and second derivatives of $f_{\\epsilon}(x) = (x^2 + \\epsilon)^{1/2}$ using the chain rule.\n    The first derivative is:\n    $$f_{\\epsilon}'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} (x^2 + \\epsilon)^{1/2} = \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 + \\epsilon)^{-1/2} \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx}(x^2 + \\epsilon) = \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 + \\epsilon)^{-1/2} \\cdot (2x)$$\n    $$f_{\\epsilon}'(x) = x(x^2 + \\epsilon)^{-1/2} = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2 + \\epsilon}}$$\n    To find the second derivative, we apply the quotient rule to $f_{\\epsilon}'(x)$:\n    $$f_{\\epsilon}''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2 + \\epsilon}} \\right) = \\frac{(1) \\cdot \\sqrt{x^2 + \\epsilon} - x \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx}(\\sqrt{x^2 + \\epsilon})}{(\\sqrt{x^2 + \\epsilon})^2}$$\n    From the calculation of the first derivative, we know $\\frac{d}{dx}(\\sqrt{x^2 + \\epsilon}) = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2 + \\epsilon}}$. Substituting this in:\n    $$f_{\\epsilon}''(x) = \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2 + \\epsilon} - x \\left( \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2 + \\epsilon}} \\right)}{x^2 + \\epsilon} = \\frac{\\sqrt{x^2 + \\epsilon} - \\frac{x^2}{\\sqrt{x^2 + \\epsilon}}}{x^2 + \\epsilon}$$\n    To simplify this expression, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by $\\sqrt{x^2 + \\epsilon}$:\n    $$f_{\\epsilon}''(x) = \\frac{(\\sqrt{x^2 + \\epsilon})^2 - x^2}{(x^2 + \\epsilon)\\sqrt{x^2 + \\epsilon}} = \\frac{(x^2 + \\epsilon) - x^2}{(x^2 + \\epsilon)^{3/2}} = \\frac{\\epsilon}{(x^2 + \\epsilon)^{3/2}}$$\n    These are the explicit expressions for the first and second derivatives.\n\n3.  **Proof of Uniform Approximation Bound**\n    We need to prove that $\\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} \\big| f_{\\epsilon}(x) - |x| \\big| \\leq \\sqrt{\\epsilon}$.\n    Let $g(x) = f_{\\epsilon}(x) - |x| = \\sqrt{x^2 + \\epsilon} - \\sqrt{x^2}$.\n    By multiplying and dividing by the conjugate, we get:\n    $$g(x) = \\frac{(\\sqrt{x^2 + \\epsilon} - \\sqrt{x^2})(\\sqrt{x^2 + \\epsilon} + \\sqrt{x^2})}{\\sqrt{x^2 + \\epsilon} + \\sqrt{x^2}} = \\frac{(x^2 + \\epsilon) - x^2}{\\sqrt{x^2 + \\epsilon} + |x|} = \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\sqrt{x^2 + \\epsilon} + |x|}$$\n    Since $\\epsilon  0$ and the denominator is always positive, we have $g(x)  0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This means $\\big| f_{\\epsilon}(x) - |x| \\big| = g(x)$.\n    We wish to find the supremum of $g(x)$. The denominator $\\sqrt{x^2 + \\epsilon} + |x|$ is a non-negative, increasing function of $|x|$. Therefore, $g(x)$ is maximized when its denominator is minimized. The minimum value of the denominator occurs at $x = 0$, where it is $\\sqrt{0^2 + \\epsilon} + |0| = \\sqrt{\\epsilon}$.\n    At $x=0$, the value of the function is $g(0) = \\frac{\\epsilon}{\\sqrt{\\epsilon}} = \\sqrt{\\epsilon}$.\n    For any $x \\neq 0$, the denominator $\\sqrt{x^2 + \\epsilon} + |x|$ is strictly greater than $\\sqrt{\\epsilon}$, so $g(x)  \\sqrt{\\epsilon}$.\n    Thus, the supremum of $g(x)$ over all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is achieved at $x=0$:\n    $$\\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} \\big| f_{\\epsilon}(x) - |x| \\big| = \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} g(x) = g(0) = \\sqrt{\\epsilon}$$\n    The statement is that the supremum is less than or equal to $\\sqrt{\\epsilon}$, which is proven by our finding that it is exactly equal to $\\sqrt{\\epsilon}$.\n\n4.  **Analysis of the Second Derivative**\n    First, we show $f_{\\epsilon}''(x) \\geq 0$. From Part 2, $f_{\\epsilon}''(x) = \\frac{\\epsilon}{(x^2 + \\epsilon)^{3/2}}$. Given $\\epsilon  0$, the numerator is positive. The term $x^2 \\geq 0$, so $x^2+\\epsilon  0$. Any positive real number raised to the power of $3/2$ is positive. Thus, the denominator is always positive, and the entire expression $f_{\\epsilon}''(x)$ is strictly positive for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This implies $f_{\\epsilon}''(x) \\geq 0$.\n\n    Second, we compute the improper integral $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f_{\\epsilon}''(x)\\,dx$. By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, this integral is equal to the change in the antiderivative, $f_{\\epsilon}'(x)$, over the interval $(-\\infty, \\infty)$:\n    $$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f_{\\epsilon}''(x)\\,dx = \\lim_{b \\to \\infty} f_{\\epsilon}'(b) - \\lim_{a \\to -\\infty} f_{\\epsilon}'(a)$$\n    Using the expression $f_{\\epsilon}'(x) = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2 + \\epsilon}}$:\n    $$\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} f_{\\epsilon}'(x) = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2 + \\epsilon}} = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{x}{|x|\\sqrt{1 + \\epsilon/x^2}} = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{x}{x\\sqrt{1 + \\epsilon/x^2}} = \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + \\epsilon/x^2}} = 1$$\n    $$\\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} f_{\\epsilon}'(x) = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2 + \\epsilon}} = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} \\frac{x}{|x|\\sqrt{1 + \\epsilon/x^2}} = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} \\frac{x}{(-x)\\sqrt{1 + \\epsilon/x^2}} = \\lim_{x \\to -\\infty} \\frac{-1}{\\sqrt{1 + \\epsilon/x^2}} = -1$$\n    Therefore, the integral is:\n    $$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f_{\\epsilon}''(x)\\,dx = (1) - (-1) = 2$$\n\n    **Relation to the Dirac Delta Distribution:** The family of functions $\\{f_{\\epsilon}''\\}_{\\epsilon0}$ is an approximation to the distribution $2\\delta_0$. A sequence of functions $g_{\\epsilon}(x)$ approximates $c\\delta_0$ as $\\epsilon \\downarrow 0$ if (i) $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} g_{\\epsilon}(x)\\,dx = c$ for all $\\epsilon$, and (ii) for any fixed $x \\neq 0$, $\\lim_{\\epsilon \\downarrow 0} g_{\\epsilon}(x) = 0$.\n    Our family $f_{\\epsilon}''(x)$ satisfies these conditions for $c=2$:\n    (i) We have just shown that $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f_{\\epsilon}''(x)\\,dx = 2$.\n    (ii) For any fixed $x \\neq 0$, we have $\\lim_{\\epsilon \\downarrow 0} f_{\\epsilon}''(x) = \\lim_{\\epsilon \\downarrow 0} \\frac{\\epsilon}{(x^2 + \\epsilon)^{3/2}} = \\frac{0}{(x^2)^{3/2}} = 0$.\n    The functions $f_{\\epsilon}''(x)$ are non-negative and their total area is concentrated in an ever-smaller neighborhood of $x=0$ as $\\epsilon \\downarrow 0$. This behavior is characteristic of a sequence converging to a scaled Dirac delta distribution. Heuristically, as $\\epsilon \\downarrow 0$, $f_{\\epsilon}(x) \\to |x|$. The first derivative $f_{\\epsilon}'(x) = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2+\\epsilon}}$ converges to $\\frac{x}{|x|} = \\text{sgn}(x)$ for $x \\neq 0$. The derivative of the signum function, $\\text{sgn}(x)$, in the sense of distributions is $2\\delta_0(x)$, which represents the jump of size $2$ at the origin. Our calculation shows how this singular behavior is regularized and recovered in the limit.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2 + \\epsilon}}  \\frac{\\epsilon}{(x^2 + \\epsilon)^{3/2}} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "3079502"}, {"introduction": "Tanaka's formula decomposes the $|B_t|$ process into a martingale part and a finite variation part, which is the local time.

The Itô isometry states that for a predictable process $H_s$ adapted to the filtration of the Brownian motion $B_s$, if $E[\\int_0^t H_s^2 ds]  \\infty$, then the Itô integral $I_t = \\int_0^t H_s dB_s$ is a well-defined square-integrable martingale, and its second moment is given by:\n$$\nE\\left[ \\left( \\int_{0}^{t} H_{s} dB_{s} \\right)^2 \\right] = E\\left[ \\int_{0}^{t} H_{s}^2 ds \\right]\n$$\nIn our case, the integrand is $H_s = \\operatorname{sgn}(B_s)$. We apply the Itô isometry to $M_t$:\n$$\nE\\left[(M_t)^2\\right] = E\\left[ \\left( \\int_{0}^{t} \\operatorname{sgn}(B_{s}) dB_{s} \\right)^2 \\right] = E\\left[ \\int_{0}^{t} (\\operatorname{sgn}(B_{s}))^2 ds \\right]\n$$\nThe integrand $(\\operatorname{sgn}(B_s))^2$ can be analyzed based on the value of $B_s$:\n- If $B_s \\neq 0$, then $\\operatorname{sgn}(B_s)$ is either $1$ or $-1$, so $(\\operatorname{sgn}(B_s))^2 = 1$.\n- If $B_s = 0$, then $\\operatorname{sgn}(B_s) = 0$, so $(\\operatorname{sgn}(B_s))^2 = 0$.\n\nThus, we can write $(\\operatorname{sgn}(B_s))^2 = 1_{\\{B_s \\neq 0\\}}$, where $1_A$ is the indicator function of a set $A$. The expression becomes:\n$$\nE\\left[(M_t)^2\\right] = E\\left[ \\int_{0}^{t} 1_{\\{B_s \\neq 0\\}} ds \\right]\n$$\nSince the integrand is non-negative, we can use Tonelli's theorem to interchange the expectation and the integral:\n$$\nE\\left[(M_t)^2\\right] = \\int_{0}^{t} E\\left[ 1_{\\{B_s \\neq 0\\}} \\right] ds\n$$\nThe expectation inside the integral is $E[1_{\\{B_s \\neq 0\\}}] = P(B_s \\neq 0)$. For a standard Brownian motion, $B_0 = 0$. For any $s  0$, $B_s$ follows a normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $s$, i.e., $B_s \\sim N(0, s)$. This is a continuous probability distribution, so the probability of $B_s$ taking any specific value is zero. In particular, $P(B_s = 0) = 0$ for any $s  0$.\nTherefore, for $s0$, $P(B_s \\neq 0) = 1 - P(B_s = 0) = 1$.\nThe case $s=0$ corresponds to a single point in the domain of integration $[0, t]$, and its contribution to the Lebesgue integral is zero. We can thus write:\n$$\nE\\left[(M_t)^2\\right] = \\int_{0}^{t} 1 \\, ds = t\n$$\n\nNext, we use Tanaka's formula to provide further insight. Tanaka's formula is an extension of Itô's lemma for convex functions. For the function $f(x)=|x|$, which is convex but not $C^2$ at $x=0$, applied to the process $B_t$, Tanaka's formula states:\n$$\n|B_t| - |B_0| = \\int_0^t \\operatorname{sgn}(B_s) dB_s + L_t^0\n$$\nwhere $L_t^0$ is the local time of the Brownian motion $B_t$ at level $0$.\nGiven that $B_0=0$ and $M_t = \\int_0^t \\operatorname{sgn}(B_s) dB_s$, we have:\n$$\n|B_t| = M_t + L_t^0\n$$\nThis equation represents the Doob-Meyer decomposition of the submartingale $|B_t|$ into its martingale part, $M_t$, and a non-decreasing, non-negative predictable process, $L_t^0$ (the increasing part). This confirms that $M_t$ is indeed the martingale part of the absolute value process $\\{|B_t|\\}_{t \\ge 0}$.\n\nFinally, we explain why the computed expression $E[(M_t)^2]$ coincides with the quadratic variation of $M_t$. The quadratic variation of a continuous local martingale $N_t$ is denoted by $\\langle N, N \\rangle_t$. For an Itô integral of the form $N_t = \\int_0^t H_s dB_s$, the quadratic variation is given by:\n$$\n\\langle N, N \\rangle_t = \\int_0^t H_s^2 ds\n$$\nFor our martingale $M_t = \\int_0^t \\operatorname{sgn}(B_s) dB_s$, the quadratic variation is:\n$$\n\\langle M, M \\rangle_t = \\int_0^t (\\operatorname{sgn}(B_s))^2 ds\n$$\nIt is a fundamental property of one-dimensional Brownian motion that the set of times $\\{s \\in [0, t] : B_s = 0\\}$ has Lebesgue measure zero, almost surely. This means that for a typical sample path of the Brownian motion, $(\\operatorname{sgn}(B_s))^2 = 1$ for almost every $s \\in [0, t]$. Consequently, the integral evaluates to $t$ almost surely:\n$$\n\\langle M, M \\rangle_t = \\int_0^t 1 \\, ds = t \\quad \\text{(a.s.)}\n$$\nSo, the quadratic variation of $M_t$ is the deterministic process $\\langle M, M \\rangle_t = t$.\n\nA key property of continuous square-integrable martingales like $M_t$ (with $M_0=0$) is that the process $M_t^2 - \\langle M, M \\rangle_t$ is itself a martingale. This implies:\n$$\nE[M_t^2 - \\langle M, M \\rangle_t] = E[M_0^2 - \\langle M, M \\rangle_0]\n$$\nSince $M_0 = 0$ and $\\langle M, M \\rangle_0 = 0$, the right-hand side is $0$. Therefore,\n$$\nE[M_t^2] = E[\\langle M, M \\rangle_t]\n$$\nSubstituting our result for the quadratic variation, $\\langle M, M \\rangle_t = t$, we get:\n$$\nE[M_t^2] = E[t]\n$$\nSince $t$ is a deterministic quantity, its expectation is simply itself.\n$$\nE[M_t^2] = t\n$$\nThis confirms our initial calculation using the Itô isometry and explains the connection: the expected value of the square of the martingale, $E[M_t^2]$, is equal to the expected value of its quadratic variation, $E[\\langle M, M \\rangle_t]$. Since the quadratic variation $\\langle M, M \\rangle_t$ is the deterministic function $t$, $E[M_t^2]$ is equal to $t$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{t}\n$$", "id": "3079519"}, {"introduction": "This practice showcases the full power of Tanaka's formula as a tool for analysis.

We are given that for a fixed $t0$, the random variable $B_t$ follows a normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $t$. Its probability density function (PDF), which we denote by $f_{B_t}(x)$, is given by:\n$$f_{B_t}(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2t}\\right)$$\nThe expectation of the absolute value, $\\mathbb{E}[|B_{t}|]$, is calculated by integrating $|x|$ against this PDF over the entire real line:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[|B_{t}|] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |x| f_{B_t}(x) \\, \\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |x| \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2t}\\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}x$$\nThe integrand, $|x| \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2t}\\right)$, is an even function of $x$.
