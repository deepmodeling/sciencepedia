Explicit Solution for $S_t$**\n\nTo solve the SDE for $S_t$, we consider the process for the natural logarithm of the asset price, $X_t = \\ln S_t$. We apply Itô's lemma to the function $f(s) = \\ln s$ with $s=S_t$. The partial derivatives are $f'(s) = \\frac{1}{s}$ and $f''(s) = -\\frac{1}{s^2}$.

Risk-Neutral Dynamics and Distribution of $\\ln S_T$**\n\nThe principle of arbitrage-free pricing asserts the existence of an Equivalent Martingale Measure (EMM), denoted by $\\mathbb{Q}$, under which the discounted asset price $\\tilde{S}_t = B_t^{-1}S_t$ is a martingale. Here, $B_t = \\exp(rt)$ is the money market account with constant risk-free rate $r$. First, we find the dynamics of $\\tilde{S}_t = \\exp(-rt)S_t$ under the physical measure $\\mathbb{P}$ using Itô's product rule:\n$$\nd\\tilde{S}_t = d(\\exp(-rt)S_t) = S_t d(\\exp(-rt)) + \\exp(-rt) dS_t\n$$\n$$\nd\\tilde{S}_t = S_t(-r \\exp(-rt) dt) + \\exp(-rt)(\\mu S_t dt + \\sigma S_t dW_t)\n$$\n$$\nd\\tilde{S}_t = \\exp(-rt)S_t(\\mu - r) dt + \\exp(-rt)S_t \\sigma dW_t = \\tilde{S}_t(\\mu - r) dt + \\tilde{S}_t \\sigma dW_t\n$$\nFor $\\tilde{S}_t$ to be a martingale, its drift term must be zero. By Girsanov's theorem, we can define a new process $W_t^{\\mathbb{Q}}$ which is a Brownian motion under the measure $\\mathbb{Q}$, related to the original Brownian motion $W_t$ by $dW_t = dW_t^{\\mathbb{Q}} - \\theta dt$, where $\\theta = \\frac{\\mu - r}{\\sigma}$ is the market price of risk.\nSubstituting this into the dynamics for $\\tilde{S}_t$:\n$$\nd\\tilde{S}_t = \\tilde{S}_t(\\mu - r) dt + \\tilde{S}_t \\sigma (dW_t^{\\mathbb{Q}} - \\frac{\\mu-r}{\\sigma} dt) = \\tilde{S}_t(\\mu - r - (\\mu - r)) dt + \\tilde{S}_t \\sigma dW_t^{\\mathbb{Q}}\n$$\n$$\nd\\tilde{S}_t = \\sigma \\tilde{S}_t dW_t^{\\mathbb{Q}}\n$$\nThis demonstrates that $\\tilde{S}_t$ is a martingale under $\\mathbb{Q}$. Now we find the dynamics of $S_t = \\exp(rt)\\tilde{S}_t$ under $\\mathbb{Q}$:\n$$\ndS_t = d(\\exp(rt)\\tilde{S}_t) = \\tilde{S}_t d(\\exp(rt)) + \\exp(rt) d\\tilde{S}_t\n$$\n$$\ndS_t = \\tilde{S}_t (r \\exp(rt) dt) + \\exp(rt)(\\sigma \\tilde{S}_t dW_t^{\\mathbb{Q}}) = r S_t dt + \\sigma S_t dW_t^{\\mathbb{Q}}\n$$\nThis SDE describes the risk-neutral dynamics of the asset price. The real-world drift $\\mu$ is replaced by the risk-free rate $r$. The solution for $S_t$ under $\\mathbb{Q}$ is obtained by replacing $\\mu$ with $r$ in the solution from Step 1:\n$$\nS_T = S_0 \\exp\\left(\\left(r - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right) T + \\sigma W_T^{\\mathbb{Q}}\\right)\n$$\nFrom this, we find the distribution of $\\ln S_T$ under $\\mathbb{Q}$. Taking the natural logarithm:\n$$\n\\ln S_T = \\ln S_0 + \\left(r - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right) T + \\sigma W_T^{\\mathbb{Q}}\n$$\nUnder $\\mathbb{Q}$, $W_T^{\\mathbb{Q}}$ is a normally distributed random variable with mean $0$ and variance $T$, i.e., $W_T^{\\mathbb{Q}} \\sim N(0, T)$. Since $\\ln S_T$ is a linear transformation of a normal random variable, it is also normally distributed. Its expected value and variance under $\\mathbb{Q}$ are:\n$$\nE^{\\mathbb{Q}}[\\ln S_T] = \\ln S_0 + \\left(r - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right) T + \\sigma E^{\\mathbb{Q}}[W_T^{\\mathbb{Q}}] = \\ln S_0 + \\left(r - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right) T\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Var}^{\\mathbb{Q}}(\\ln S_T) = \\text{Var}^{\\mathbb{Q}}\\left(\\sigma W_T^{\\mathbb{Q}}\\right) = \\sigma^2 \\text{Var}^{\\mathbb{Q}}(W_T^{\\mathbb{Q}}) = \\sigma^2 T\n$$\nThus, under the risk-neutral measure $\\mathbb{Q}$, $\\ln S_T \\sim N\\left(\\ln S_0 + \\left(r - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)T, \\sigma^2 T\\right)$.\n\n**3. Computation of the Time-0 Call Option Price $C_0$**\n\nThe risk-neutral valuation principle states that the time-$0$ price of the European call option, $C_0$, is the discounted expected payoff under the EMM $\\mathbb{Q}$:\n$$\nC_0 = E^{\\mathbb{Q}}[\\exp(-rT)(S_T - K)^+] = \\exp(-rT) E^{\\mathbb{Q}}[\\max(S_T - K, 0)]\n$$\nLet $X_T = \\ln S_T$. We know $X_T \\sim N(m, s^2)$ where $m = \\ln S_0 + (r - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)T$ and $s^2 = \\sigma^2 T$. The expectation is:\n$$\nE^{\\mathbb{Q}}[\\max(S_T - K, 0)] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\max(\\exp(x) - K, 0) f_{X_T}(x) dx\n$$\nwhere $f_{X_T}(x)$ is the probability density function of $X_T$. The integrand is non-zero only for $\\exp(x)  K$, i.e., $x  \\ln K$.\n$$\nE^{\\mathbb{Q}}[\\max(S_T - K, 0)] = \\int_{\\ln K}^{\\infty} (\\exp(x) - K) \\frac{1}{s\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x-m)^2}{2s^2}\\right) dx\n$$\nWe split this into two integrals:\n$$\nE^{\\mathbb{Q}}[\\max(S_T - K, 0)] = \\underbrace{\\int_{\\ln K}^{\\infty} \\exp(x) \\frac{1}{s\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x-m)^2}{2s^2}\\right) dx}_{I_1} - \\underbrace{K \\int_{\\ln K}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{s\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x-m)^2}{2s^2}\\right) dx}_{I_2}\n$$\nFor $I_2$, we perform a change of variable $z = \\frac{x-m}{s}$, so $dx=s dz$.

The core principle governing the relationship between these instruments in a no-arbitrage framework is put-call parity.\n\nFirst, we establish the put-call parity relationship from first principles. Let $C_T$ and $P_T$ be the payoffs of a European call and put, respectively, at maturity $T$. Their definitions are:\n$$ C_T = \\max(S_T - K, 0) $$\n$$ P_T = \\max(K - S_T, 0) $$\nwhere $S_T$ is the stock price at time $T$ and $K$ is the strike price.\n\nConsider a portfolio constructed at time $t=0$ consisting of one long call option and one short put option on the same underlying stock with the same strike price $K$ and maturity $T$. The value of this portfolio at maturity $T$ is:\n$$ C_T - P_T = \\max(S_T - K, 0) - \\max(K - S_T, 0) $$\nWe analyze this payoff for all possible values of $S_T$:\n1. If $S_T  K$, the payoff is $(S_T - K) - 0 = S_T - K$.\n2. If $S_T \\le K$, the payoff is $0 - (K - S_T) = S_T - K$.\nThus, the terminal payoff of the portfolio (long call, short put) is deterministically equal to $S_T - K$.\n\nThis terminal payoff, $S_T - K$, can be replicated by another portfolio: one long share of the underlying stock and a short position in a zero-coupon bond with face value $K$ maturing at time $T$. The stock has value $S_T$ at maturity, and the bond obligation requires a payment of $K$.\n\nBy the principle of no arbitrage (or the law of one price), two portfolios with identical payoffs in all future states must have the same price today. The price at $t=0$ of the first portfolio is $C_0 - P_0$. The price of the second portfolio is $S_0 - K \\exp(-rT)$, where $S_0$ is the stock price at $t=0$ and $K \\exp(-rT)$ is the present value of the $K$ obligation at the continuously compounded risk-free rate $r$.\nTherefore, the put-call parity relationship is:\n$$ C_0 - P_0 = S_0 - K\\exp(-rT) $$\n\nAny deviation from this equality signals an arbitrage opportunity. We now substitute the given market quotes into this equation to check for a violation.\nThe given values are:\n- $S_0 = 100$\n- $K = 100$\n- $r = 0.05$\n- $T = 0.5$\n- $C_0 = 9$\n- $P_0 = 6$\n\nWe compute the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) of the parity equation.\nLHS:\n$$ C_0 - P_0 = 9 - 6 = 3 $$\nRHS:\n$$ S_0 - K\\exp(-rT) = 100 - 100\\exp(-0.05 \\times 0.5) = 100 - 100\\exp(-0.025) $$\nNumerically, $\\exp(-0.025) \\approx 0.97530991$.\n$$ \\text{RHS} \\approx 100 - 100(0.97530991) = 100 - 97.530991 = 2.469009 $$\nComparing the two sides, we find:\n$$ 3 > 2.469009... $$\nSo, $C_0 - P_0 > S_0 - K\\exp(-rT)$. This confirms the existence of an arbitrage opportunity. The portfolio represented by the LHS (long call, short put) is overpriced relative to the portfolio represented by the RHS (long stock, short bond).\n\nTo exploit this arbitrage, we construct a strategy to \"sell the expensive\" and \"buy the cheap\". This translates to:\n- Sell the portfolio on the LHS: Sell one call option and buy one put option.\n- Buy the portfolio on the RHS: Buy one share of stock and sell a zero-coupon bond with face value $K$. Selling the bond is equivalent to borrowing its present value.\n\nThe explicit, static, self-financing arbitrage strategy at $t=0$ per share is as follows:\n1.  **Short 1 European call**: Receive cash inflow of $C_0 = 9$.\n2.  **Long 1 European put**: Incur cash outflow of $P_0 = 6$.\n3.  **Long 1 share of stock**: Incur cash outflow of $S_0 = 100$.\n4.  **Borrow at the risk-free rate**: Borrow the present value of the strike price, $K\\exp(-rT)$, which amounts to a cash inflow of $100\\exp(-0.025)$.\n\nThe initial net cash flow at $t=0$ is the arbitrage profit:\n$$ \\text{Profit}_{t=0} = C_0 - P_0 - S_0 + K\\exp(-rT) $$\n$$ \\text{Profit}_{t=0} = (C_0 - P_0) - (S_0 - K\\exp(-rT)) $$\n$$ \\text{Profit}_{t=0} = 3 - (100 - 100\\exp(-0.025)) \\approx 3 - 2.469009 = 0.530991 $$\nThis is a positive cash inflow at $t=0$.\n\nNow, we demonstrate that the terminal payoff of this combined portfolio at time $T$ is zero, regardless of the stock price $S_T$.\nThe value of our holdings at maturity $T$ is:\n- Payoff from the short call: $-\\max(S_T - K, 0)$\n- Payoff from the long put: $+\\max(K - S_T, 0)$\n- Payoff from the long stock: $+S_T$\n- Obligation from borrowing: The amount borrowed, $K\\exp(-rT)$, grows to $K\\exp(-rT)\\exp(rT) = K$. So, the obligation is a payment of $K=100$. This is represented as a payoff of $-K$.\n\nThe total terminal payoff is:\n$$ \\text{Payoff}_T = -\\max(S_T - K, 0) + \\max(K - S_T, 0) + S_T - K $$\nWe again analyze this by cases:\n1.

This implies that $\\ln S_T$ is normally distributed:\n$$\n\\ln S_T \\sim N\\left(\\ln S_0 + \\left(r-q-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2\\right)T, \\sigma^2 T\\right)\n$$\nThe call price is $C(S_0) = \\exp(-rT)\\mathbb{E}[(S_T-K)^+]$. Evaluating this expectation using the log-normal distribution of $S_T$ yields the Black-Scholes-Merton formula for a call option with continuous dividend yield $q$:\n$$\nC(S_0) = S_0 \\exp(-qT) \\Phi(d_1) - K \\exp(-rT) \\Phi(d_2)\n$$\nwhere $\\Phi(x)$ is the cumulative distribution function of a standard normal variable, and\n$$\nd_1 = \\frac{\\ln(S_0/K) + (r-q+\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)T}{\\sigma\\sqrt{T}}, \\quad d_2 = d_1 - \\sigma\\sqrt{T} = \\frac{\\ln(S_0/K) + (r-q-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)T}{\\sigma\\sqrt{T}}\n$$\n\nThe problem requires a justification for the interchange of differentiation and expectation. The option payoff $(S_T - K)^+$ is not everywhere differentiable with respect to $S_0$, as its derivative at $S_T=K$ is discontinuous. However, the expectation operator smooths the function. Rigorously, one can justify passing the derivative under the expectation by using properties of generalized functions. The first derivative of the payoff with respect to $S_T$ is the Heaviside step function $\\mathbf{1}_{S_TK}$. The second derivative is the Dirac delta function $\\delta(S_T-K)$. These can be handled within the expectation integral, and the results match those obtained by differentiating the final closed-form price formula. Henceforth, we differentiate the closed-form formula, which is a valid procedure.\n\nWe now compute the first derivative of $C(S_0)$ with respect to $S_0$, known as Delta ($\\Delta_C$). We use the chain rule and the fact that $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\Phi(x)}{\\mathrm{d}x} = \\phi(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp(-x^2/2)$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial d_1}{\\partial S_0} = \\frac{\\partial d_2}{\\partial S_0} = \\frac{1}{S_0 \\sigma \\sqrt{T}}\n$$\nSo, the derivative of the call price is:\n$$\n\\Delta_C = \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial S_0} = \\exp(-qT)\\Phi(d_1) + S_0\\exp(-qT)\\phi(d_1)\\frac{\\partial d_1}{\\partial S_0} - K\\exp(-rT)\\phi(d_2)\\frac{\\partial d_2}{\\partial S_0}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta_C = \\exp(-qT)\\Phi(d_1) + \\frac{\\exp(-qT)\\phi(d_1)}{\\sigma\\sqrt{T}} - \\frac{K\\exp(-rT)\\phi(d_2)}{S_0\\sigma\\sqrt{T}}\n$$\nA key identity in the Black-Scholes framework is $S_0\\exp(-qT)\\phi(d_1) = K\\exp(-rT)\\phi(d_2)$. Using this, the last two terms cancel, yielding the simple expression for Delta:\n$$\n\\Delta_C = \\exp(-qT)\\Phi(d_1)\n$$\n\nNow, we compute the second derivative, Gamma ($\\Gamma$), by differentiating $\\Delta_C$ with respect to $S_0$:\n$$\n\\Gamma = \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial S_0^2} = \\frac{\\partial \\Delta_C}{\\partial S_0} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial S_0} \\left( \\exp(-qT)\\Phi(d_1) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\Gamma = \\exp(-qT) \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\Phi(d_1)}{\\mathrm{d}d_1} \\frac{\\partial d_1}{\\partial S_0} = \\exp(-qT) \\phi(d_1) \\frac{1}{S_0 \\sigma \\sqrt{T}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\phi(d_1)$ and $d_1$ gives the full closed-form formula for Gamma:\n$$\n\\Gamma = \\frac{\\exp(-qT)}{S_0 \\sigma \\sqrt{T}} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}d_1^2\\right) = \\frac{\\exp(-qT)}{S_0 \\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi T}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\ln(S_0/K) + (r-q+\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2)T}{\\sigma\\sqrt{T}} \\right)^2 \\right)\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the Gamma of a European call option.\n\nNext, we must show that the call and put Gammas are equal. We use the put-call parity relationship for European options on an asset paying a continuous dividend yield $q$:\n$$\nC(S_0) - P(S_0) = S_0 \\exp(-qT) - K \\exp(-rT)\n$$\nDifferentiating this identity with respect to $S_0$ once gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial S_0} - \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial S_0} = \\exp(-qT)\n$$\nDifferentiating a second time with respect to $S_0$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial S_0^2} - \\frac{\\partial^2 P}{\\partial S_0^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial S_0}(\\exp(-qT)) = 0\n$$\nSince the right-hand side is constant with respect to $S_0$, its derivative is zero. Therefore,\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial S_0^2} = \\frac{\\partial^2 P}{\\partial S_0^2}\n$$\nThis confirms that the Gamma of a European call is identical to the Gamma of a European put with the same parameters.\n\nTo determine the sign of $\\Gamma$, we examine its formula: $\\Gamma = \\frac{\\exp(-qT) \\phi(d_1)}{S_0 \\sigma \\sqrt{T}}$.\nThe problem specifies the following constraints on the parameters: $S_0  0$, $\\sigma  0$, $T  0$, and $q \\ge 0$.\nAnalysing each term in the expression for $\\Gamma$:\n- The discount factor $\\exp(-qT)$ is positive since $q \\ge 0$ and $T0$.\n- The probability density function of a standard normal distribution, $\\phi(d_1) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp(-d_1^2/2)$, is strictly positive for any real-valued argument $d_1$.\n- The denominator $S_0 \\sigma \\sqrt{T}$ is a product of strictly positive numbers, hence it is positive.\nSince $\\Gamma$ is a ratio of positive quantities, we conclude that $\\Gamma  0$. The positivity of Gamma reflects the convexity of the option price function with respect to the underlying asset price.\n\nFinally, we interpret the units of $\\Gamma$. Let the currency unit of the asset price $S_0$ and the option price $C$ be denoted by `CU`.\n- Option price $C$: `CU`.\n- Asset price $S_0$: `CU`.\n- The first derivative, Delta, is $\\Delta = \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial S_0}$. Its units are $\\frac{\\text{CU}}{\\text{CU}}$, which is dimensionless.\n- The second derivative, Gamma, is $\\Gamma = \\frac{\\partial \\Delta}{\\partial S_0}$. Its units are $\\frac{\\text{dimensionless}}{\\text{CU}} = (\\text{CU})^{-1}$.\nThus, the unit of Gamma is the inverse of the currency unit. It quantifies the change in the option's Delta for a one-unit change in the underlying price. In terms of powers of the currency unit, the unit is $-1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\exp(-qT)}{S_0 \\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi T}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{S_0}{K}\\right) + \\left(r - q + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^{2}\\right)T}{\\sigma\\sqrt{T}}\\right)^{2}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "3051897"}]}
