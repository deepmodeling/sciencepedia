We use Itō's lemma on the function $f(t, s) = s e^{-rt}$. The partial derivatives are $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} = -r s e^{-rt}$, $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial s} = e^{-rt}$, and $\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial s^2} = 0$. The dynamics of $S_t$ are $dS_t = \\mu S_t dt + \\sigma S_t dW_t$.\nApplying Itō's formula:\n$$\nd\\tilde{S}_t = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} dt + \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial S_t} dS_t + \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial S_t^2} (dS_t)^2\n$$\n$$\nd\\tilde{S}_t = (-r S_t e^{-rt}) dt + e^{-rt} (\\mu S_t dt + \\sigma S_t dW_t) + 0\n$$\nSubstituting $\\tilde{S}_t = S_t e^{-rt}$, we get:\n$$\nd\\tilde{S}_t = -r \\tilde{S}_t dt + \\mu \\tilde{S}_t dt + \\sigma \\tilde{S}_t dW_t = (\\mu - r)\\tilde{S}_t dt + \\sigma \\tilde{S}_t dW_t\n$$\nThis is the SDE for the discounted price under $\\mathbb{P}$. Its drift, $(\\mu - r)$, is the excess return over the risk-free rate.\n\n**Step 2: Change of Measure via Girsanov's Theorem**\n\nTo make $\\tilde{S}_t$ a martingale, we must find a measure $\\mathbb{Q}$ under which its drift is zero. Girsanov's theorem provides the mechanism. We define a new measure $\\mathbb{Q}$ via the Radon-Nikodym density process $Z_t = \\frac{d\\mathbb{Q}}{d\\mathbb{P}}\\big|_{\\mathcal{F}_t}$. This process is defined as the stochastic exponential of $-\\int \\lambda_s dW_s$:\n$$\nZ_t = \\mathcal{E}\\left(-\\int \\lambda_s dW_s\\right)_t = \\exp\\left(-\\int_0^t \\lambda_s dW_s - \\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^t \\lambda_s^2 ds\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda_s$ is the market price of risk. In this model, $\\lambda = (\\mu - r)/\\sigma$ is constant. Since $\\lambda$ is constant, Novikov's condition, $\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{P}}[\\exp(\\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^T \\lambda^2 dt)]  \\infty$, is satisfied, which ensures $Z_t$ is a true martingale.\nGirsanov's theorem states that the process $W^\\mathbb{Q}_t$ defined by $W^\\mathbb{Q}_t = W_t + \\int_0^t \\lambda_s ds = W_t + \\lambda t$ is a standard Brownian motion under $\\mathbb{Q}$. This gives the relationship $dW_t = dW^\\mathbb{Q}_t - \\lambda dt$.\n\n**Step 3: Verification of the Martingale Property**\n\nWe substitute $dW_t = dW^\\mathbb{Q}_t - \\lambda dt$ into the SDE for $\\tilde{S}_t$:\n$$\nd\\tilde{S}_t = (\\mu - r)\\tilde{S}_t dt + \\sigma \\tilde{S}_t (dW^\\mathbb{Q}_t - \\lambda dt) = ((\\mu - r) - \\sigma\\lambda)\\tilde{S}_t dt + \\sigma \\tilde{S}_t dW^\\mathbb{Q}_t\n$$\nNow, we substitute the value of $\\lambda = (\\mu - r)/\\sigma$:\n$$\n(\\mu - r) - \\sigma\\lambda = (\\mu - r) - \\sigma\\left(\\frac{\\mu - r}{\\sigma}\\right) = 0\n$$\nThe drift term vanishes, and the SDE for $\\tilde{S}_t$ under $\\mathbb{Q}$ becomes:\n$$\nd\\tilde{S}_t = \\sigma \\tilde{S}_t dW^\\mathbb{Q}_t\n$$\nA process with zero drift is a local martingale.
