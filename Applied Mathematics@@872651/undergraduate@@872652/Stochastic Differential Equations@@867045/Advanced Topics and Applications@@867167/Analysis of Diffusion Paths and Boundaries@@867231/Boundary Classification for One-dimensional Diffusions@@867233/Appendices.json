We may proceed with the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Correct Solution\n\nFor a one-dimensional diffusion on an interval $(l,r)$ given by $dX_t = b(X_t)dt + \\sigma(X_t)dW_t$, Feller's boundary classification relies on the properties of the scale function $s(x)$ and the speed measure $m(x)dx$.\n\n1.  **Drift and Diffusion Coefficients:**\n    From the SDE $dX_t = dt + dW_t$, we identify the drift $b(x)=1$ and the diffusion coefficient $\\sigma(x)=1$.\n\n2.  **Scale Function:**\n    The density of the scale function, $s'(x)$, is given by\n    $$ s'(x) = \\exp\\left( - \\int \\frac{2b(x)}{\\sigma(x)^2} dx \\right) $$\n    Substituting $b(x)=1$ and $\\sigma(x)=1$, we get\n    $$ s'(x) = \\exp\\left( - \\int \\frac{2 \\cdot 1}{1^2} dx \\right) = \\exp\\left( - \\int 2 dx \\right) = C_1 e^{-2x} $$\n    The scale function is defined up to an affine transformation, so we can choose the constant of integration $C_1=1$. Thus, we take $s'(x) = e^{-2x}$.\n    To find the scale function $s(x)$, we integrate $s'(x)$. The options suggest a normalization $s(0)=0$.\n    $$ s(x) = \\int_0^x s'(y) dy = \\int_0^x e^{-2y} dy = \\left[ -\\frac{1}{2} e^{-2y} \\right]_0^x = -\\frac{1}{2}e^{-2x} - \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}e^0\\right) = \\frac{1-e^{-2x}}{2} $$\n    This is a strictly increasing function on $(0,1)$.\n\n3.  **Speed Measure:**\n    The density of the speed measure, $m(x)$, is given by\n    $$ m(x) = \\frac{2}{\\sigma(x)^2 s'(x)} $$\n    Substituting $\\sigma(x)=1$ and $s'(x)=e^{-2x}$, we find\n    $$ m(x) = \\frac{2}{1^2 \\cdot e^{-2x}} = 2e^{2x} $$\n\n4.  **Feller's Boundary Integrals:**\n    We classify the boundaries $l=0$ and $r=1$ by checking the finiteness of four integrals. We use the specified reference point $x_0 = \\frac{1}{2}$. The values of the scale function at the key points are:\n    $s(l) = s(0) = \\frac{1-e^0}{2} = 0$\n    $s(x_0) = s(\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1-e^{-1}}{2}$\n    $s(r) = s(1) = \\frac{1-e^{-2}}{2}$\n\n    The integrals for the left boundary $l=0$ are:\n    $$ B(l) = B(0) = \\int_0^{1/2} (s(x) - s(0)) m(x) dx = \\int_0^{1/2} \\left(\\frac{1-e^{-2x}}{2}\\right) (2e^{2x}) dx $$\n    $$ B(0) = \\int_0^{1/2} (e^{2x}-1) dx = \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}e^{2x} - x \\right]_0^{1/2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}e^1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}e^0 - 0\\right) = \\frac{e}{2} - 1 $$\n    This is a finite value.\n\n    $$ A(l) = A(0) = \\int_0^{1/2} (s(1/2) - s(x)) m(x) dx = \\int_0^{1/2} \\left(\\frac{1-e^{-1}}{2} - \\frac{1-e^{-2x}}{2}\\right) (2e^{2x}) dx $$\n    $$ A(0) = \\int_0^{1/2} (1-e^{-1} - (1-e^{-2x})) e^{2x} dx = \\int_0^{1/2} (e^{-2x} - e^{-1})e^{2x} dx = \\int_0^{1/2} (1 - e^{-1}e^{2x}) dx $$\n    $$ A(0) = \\left[ x - \\frac{e^{-1}}{2}e^{2x} \\right]_0^{1/2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{e^{-1}}{2}e^1\\right) - \\left(0 - \\frac{e^{-1}}{2}e^0\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{2e}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2e} $$\n    This is a finite value.\n\n    The integrals for the right boundary $r=1$ are:\n    $$ B(r) = B(1) = \\int_{1/2}^1 (s(x) - s(1/2)) m(x) dx = \\int_{1/2}^1 \\left(\\frac{1-e^{-2x}}{2} - \\frac{1-e^{-1}}{2}\\right) (2e^{2x}) dx $$\n    $$ B(1) = \\int_{1/2}^1 (e^{-1} - e^{-2x})e^{2x} dx = \\int_{1/2}^1 (e^{-1}e^{2x} - 1) dx $$\n    $$ B(1) = \\left[ \\frac{e^{-1}}{2}e^{2x} - x \\right]_{1/2}^1 = \\left(\\frac{e^{-1}}{2}e^2 - 1\\right) - \\left(\\frac{e^{-1}}{2}e^1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{e}{2} - 1\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{e}{2}-1 $$\n    This is a finite value.\n\n    $$ A(r) = A(1) = \\int_{1/2}^1 (s(1) - s(x)) m(x) dx = \\int_{1/2}^1 \\left(\\frac{1-e^{-2}}{2} - \\frac{1-e^{-2x}}{2}\\right) (2e^{2x}) dx $$\n    $$ A(1) = \\int_{1/2}^1 (e^{-2x} - e^{-2}) e^{2x} dx = \\int_{1/2}^1 (1-e^{-2}e^{2x}) dx $$\n    $$ A(1) = \\left[ x - \\frac{e^{-2}}{2}e^{2x} \\right]_{1/2}^1 = \\left(1 - \\frac{e^{-2}}{2}e^2\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{e^{-2}}{2}e^1\\right) = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2e}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2e} = \\frac{1}{2e} $$\n    This is a finite value.\n\n5.  **Boundary Classification:**\n    The classification rules are as follows:\n    -   A boundary is **regular** if both $A$ and $B$ integrals are finite.\n    -   A boundary is **exit** if $A$ is infinite and $B$ is finite.\n    -   A boundary is **entrance** if $A$ is finite and $B$ is infinite.\n    -   A boundary is **natural** if both $A$ and $B$ are infinite.\n\n    For the left boundary $l=0$, we found $A(0)=\\frac{1}{2e}  \\infty$ and $B(0)=\\frac{e}{2}-1  \\infty$. Therefore, $l=0$ is a **regular** boundary.\n    For the right boundary $r=1$, we found $A(1)=\\frac{1}{2e}  \\infty$ and $B(1)=\\frac{e}{2}-1  \\infty$.

It claims that $A(1)$ and $B(1)$ diverge because $m(x)$ grows. However, the integrands $(s(r)-s(x))m(x)$ and $(s(x)-s(x_0))m(x)$ are continuous and bounded on the finite integration interval $[\\frac{1}{2}, 1]$, so the integrals must be finite. Our calculation confirms this. It also incorrectly claims $B(0)$ is infinite. The conclusion that the boundaries are of exit type is therefore wrong.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n-   **D.** This option correctly identifies $s'(x)$ but then states $m(x)=e^{2x}$, omitting the factor of $2$ from the correct formula $m(x) = \\frac{2}{\\sigma(x)^2 s'(x)}$.

Derivation of Scale and Speed Densities**\n\nWe begin by deriving the scale density $s'(x)$ and the speed density $m(x)$ using the provided formulas.\n\nThe scale density is defined as:\n$$\ns'(x) \\;=\\; \\exp\\!\\left(-\\int^{x} \\frac{2\\,b(z)}{\\sigma^{2}(z)}\\,dz\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the coefficients $b(z) = \\mu z$ and $\\sigma(z) = \\sigma z$, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{2\\,b(z)}{\\sigma^{2}(z)} \\;=\\; \\frac{2(\\mu z)}{(\\sigma z)^2} \\;=\\; \\frac{2\\mu z}{\\sigma^2 z^2} \\;=\\; \\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2 z}\n$$\nThe indefinite integral is:\n$$\n\\int \\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2 z}\\,dz \\;=\\; \\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2} \\int \\frac{1}{z}\\,dz \\;=\\; \\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2} \\ln(z)\n$$\nWe ignore the constant of integration as it corresponds to a multiplicative constant for $s'(x)$, which can be absorbed into the scale function $s(x)$ without affecting the boundary classification. Thus, the argument of the exponential is $-\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2} \\ln(x) = \\ln(x^{-2\\mu/\\sigma^2})$.\n\nThe scale density is therefore:\n$$\ns'(x) \\;=\\; \\exp\\!\\left(\\ln\\left(x^{-2\\mu/\\sigma^2}\\right)\\right) \\;=\\; x^{-2\\mu/\\sigma^2}\n$$\n\nNext, the speed density is defined as:\n$$\nm(x) \\;=\\; \\frac{2}{\\sigma^{2}(x)\\,s'(x)}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\sigma(x) = \\sigma x$ and the derived expression for $s'(x)$:\n$$\nm(x) \\;=\\; \\frac{2}{(\\sigma x)^2 \\, x^{-2\\mu/\\sigma^2}} \\;=\\; \\frac{2}{\\sigma^2 x^2} \\, x^{2\\mu/\\sigma^2} \\;=\\; \\frac{2}{\\sigma^2} x^{2\\mu/\\sigma^2 - 2}\n$$\n\n**2. Boundary Classification at $0$**\n\nThe classification of the boundary at $x=0$ depends on the behavior of the scale function $s(x)$ and the convergence of the Feller integrals. First, we determine the scale function $s(x)$ by integrating the scale density $s'(x)$:\n$$\ns(x) \\;=\\; \\int^{x} s'(y)\\,dy \\;=\\; \\int^{x} y^{-2\\mu/\\sigma^2}\\,dy\n$$\nThe result of this integration depends on whether the exponent is equal to $-1$.\n\nCase I: The exponent $-2\\mu/\\sigma^2 \\neq -1$, which corresponds to $\\mu \\neq \\sigma^2/2$.\n$$\ns(x) \\;=\\; \\frac{x^{1 - 2\\mu/\\sigma^2}}{1 - 2\\mu/\\sigma^2} + C_1\n$$\nCase II: The exponent $-2\\mu/\\sigma^2 = -1$, which corresponds to $\\mu = \\sigma^2/2$.\n$$\ns(x) \\;=\\; \\int^x y^{-1}\\,dy \\;=\\; \\ln(x) + C_2\n$$\n\nWe must analyze the limit of the scale function as $x \\to 0^+$, denoted $s(0+)$.\n- If $\\mu  \\sigma^2/2$, then $1 - 2\\mu/\\sigma^2  0$. In this case, $\\lim_{x\\to 0^+} x^{1 - 2\\mu/\\sigma^2} = 0$, so $s(0+)$ is finite. We can choose the integration constant $C_1$ such that $s(0+)=0$.\n- If $\\mu  \\sigma^2/2$, then $1 - 2\\mu/\\sigma^2  0$. In this case, $\\lim_{x\\to 0^+} x^{1 - 2\\mu/\\sigma^2} = +\\infty$. Since the denominator $1 - 2\\mu/\\sigma^2$ is negative, $s(x) \\to -\\infty$ as $x \\to 0^+$. Thus, $s(0+) = -\\infty$.\n- If $\\mu = \\sigma^2/2$, $s(x) = \\ln(x) + C_2$, which tends to $-\\infty$ as $x \\to 0^+$. Thus, $s(0+) = -\\infty$.\n\nIn summary: $s(0+)$ is finite if $\\mu  \\sigma^2/2$, and $s(0+) = -\\infty$ if $\\mu \\ge \\sigma^2/2$.\n\nWe now apply the Feller integral tests for a reference point $c \\in (0, \\infty)$.\n\n**Regime A: $\\mu  \\sigma^2/2$**\nIn this regime, $s(0+)$ is finite. We can set $s(0+)=0$ by choosing the integration constant appropriately, which gives $s(x) = \\frac{x^{1 - 2\\mu/\\sigma^2}}{1 - 2\\mu/\\sigma^2}$.\nThe Feller tests are:\n$$\nN(0) \\;=\\; \\int_{0}^{c} (s(x) - s(0+))\\,m(x)\\,dx \\;=\\; \\int_{0}^{c} s(x)\\,m(x)\\,dx\n$$\nThe integrand is:\n$$\ns(x)m(x) \\;=\\; \\left(\\frac{x^{1-2\\mu/\\sigma^2}}{1-2\\mu/\\sigma^2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{2}{\\sigma^2} x^{2\\mu/\\sigma^2-2}\\right) \\;=\\; \\frac{2}{\\sigma^2(1-2\\mu/\\sigma^2)} x^{-1}\n$$\nThe integral $\\int_0^c x^{-1} dx$ diverges at $x=0$. Therefore, $N(0) = \\infty$.\n$$\n\\Sigma(0) \\;=\\; \\int_{0}^{c} (s(c) - s(x))\\,m(x)\\,dx\n$$\nAs $x \\to 0^+$, $s(x) \\to 0$, so the integrand behaves as $s(c)m(x)$. The convergence of $\\Sigma(0)$ is determined by the convergence of $\\int_0^c m(x)dx$.\n$$\n\\int_0^c m(x)dx \\;=\\; \\int_0^c \\frac{2}{\\sigma^2} x^{2\\mu/\\sigma^2 - 2} dx\n$$\nThis integral converges if and only if the exponent $2\\mu/\\sigma^2 - 2  -1$, which simplifies to $\\mu  \\sigma^2/2$. Since we are in the regime $\\mu  \\sigma^2/2$, the condition is not met, and the integral diverges. Therefore, $\\Sigma(0) = \\infty$.\nWith $s(0+)$ finite, $\\Sigma(0)=\\infty$, and $N(0)=\\infty$, the boundary at $0$ is classified as natural. It is not an entrance, regular, or exit boundary.\n\n**Regime B: $\\mu \\ge \\sigma^2/2$**\nIn this regime, $s(0+) = -\\infty$. The classification rules simplify. The boundary is either entrance or natural. It is an entrance boundary if $\\int_0^c s(x)m(x)dx$ converges, and natural if it diverges.\n\nSub-regime B1: $\\mu  \\sigma^2/2$.\nThe integral $\\int_0^c \\int_y^c s'(z)m(y)dzdy$ must be finite for entrance. An equivalent test is that $\\int_0^c \\rho(y) (\\int_y^c m(z)dz) dy  \\infty$.\nLet's compute the inner integral: $\\int_y^c m(z)dz = \\frac{2}{\\sigma^2} \\int_y^c z^{2\\mu/\\sigma^2 - 2}dz$. Since $\\mu > \\sigma^2/2$, the exponent $2\\mu/\\sigma^2-2 > -1$. So this integral is finite for $y>0$.\n$\\int_y^c z^{2\\mu/\\sigma^2-2}dz = \\frac{1}{2\\mu/\\sigma^2 - 1}[z^{2\\mu/\\sigma^2-1}]_y^c = \\frac{1}{2\\mu/\\sigma^2 - 1}(c^{2\\mu/\\sigma^2-1} - y^{2\\mu/\\sigma^2-1})$.\nThe outer integral becomes $\\int_0^c s'(y) \\frac{2}{\\sigma^2(2\\mu/\\sigma^2-1)}(c^{2\\mu/\\sigma^2-1} - y^{2\\mu/\\sigma^2-1}) dy$.\nSubstituting $s'(y)=y^{-2\\mu/\\sigma^2}$, the integrand is proportional to $y^{-2\\mu/\\sigma^2}(c^{...} - y^{2\\mu/\\sigma^2-1})$. The crucial term near $y=0$ is $y^{-2\\mu/\\sigma^2} \\cdot y^{2\\mu/\\sigma^2-1} = y^{-1}$. The integral of $y^{-1}$ diverges at $0$. So this test implies it's natural. There is an error in my logic or the standard result.\n\nLet's re-examine the classification for $\\mu \\ge \\sigma^2/2$.\nThe scale integral $\\int_0^c s'(y)dy = \\int_0^c y^{-2\\mu/\\sigma^2}dy$ diverges because $-2\\mu/\\sigma^2 \\le -1$.\nThe speed integral $\\int_0^c m(y)dy = \\int_0^c \\frac{2}{\\sigma^2}y^{2\\mu/\\sigma^2-2}dy$ converges if $2\\mu/\\sigma^2-2 > -1$, which is $\\mu > \\sigma^2/2$.\nFor $\\mu > \\sigma^2/2$: Scale integral diverges, speed integral converges. This is the condition for an **entrance** boundary.\nFor $\\mu = \\sigma^2/2$: Scale integral diverges, speed integral diverges (exponent is $-1$). This is the condition for a **natural** boundary.\nSo the classification is:\n- **Entrance** if $\\mu > \\sigma^2/2$.\n- **Natural** if $\\mu \\le \\sigma^2/2$. (The case $\\mu  \\sigma^2/2$ also gives a natural boundary, as $\\int s'(y)dy$ converges but $\\int m(y)dy$ diverges, which is the definition of an exit boundary, not natural. Let me re-check).\n\nLet's re-re-check from basics.\nScale int: $I_\\rho = \\int_0^c y^{-2\\mu/\\sigma^2} dy$. Converges if $-2\\mu/\\sigma^2 > -1 \\iff \\mu  \\sigma^2/2$.\nSpeed int: $I_m = \\int_0^c y^{2\\mu/\\sigma^2-2} dy$. Converges if $2\\mu/\\sigma^2-2 > -1 \\iff \\mu > \\sigma^2/2$.\nSo:\n- If $\\mu > \\sigma^2/2$: $I_\\rho$ diverges, $I_m$ converges. This is the condition for **entrance**.\n- If $\\mu = \\sigma^2/2$: $I_\\rho$ diverges, $I_m$ diverges. Check mixed integral. The analysis is complicated. The boundary is **natural**.\n- If $\\mu  \\sigma^2/2$: $I_\\rho$ converges, $I_m$ diverges. This is the condition for **exit**.\n\nMy first attempt at classification was incorrect. The solution's logic on this point seems to have led me astray. But the question is about $\\kappa$. Let's focus on that part.\n\n**3. Determination of the Exponent $\\kappa$**\n\nThe problem asks for the exponent $\\kappa$ in the asymptotic relation $s(x) - s(0+) \\asymp \\text{const}\\cdot x^{\\kappa}$ as $x \\downarrow 0$.\n\nIf $\\mu  \\sigma^2/2$, we have $s(0+)$ is finite and we can choose $s(0+) = 0$. Then $s(x) - s(0+) = s(x) = \\frac{x^{1 - 2\\mu/\\sigma^2}}{1 - 2\\mu/\\sigma^2}$. The leading-order small-$x$ behavior is a constant times $x^{1 - 2\\mu/\\sigma^2}$. Thus, $\\kappa = 1 - 2\\mu/\\sigma^2$.\n\nIf $\\mu > \\sigma^2/2$, we have $s(0+) = -\\infty$. The expression $s(x) - s(0+)$ is interpreted as the dominant term of $s(x)$ as $x \\to 0^+$. The function is $s(x) = \\frac{x^{1-2\\mu/\\sigma^2}}{1-2\\mu/\\sigma^2} + C_1$. The power-law term dominates the constant $C_1$ as $x \\to 0^+$. The behavior is again governed by the exponent of $x$, so $\\kappa = 1 - 2\\mu/\\sigma^2$.\n\nIf $\\mu = \\sigma^2/2$, the behavior is $s(x) = \\ln(x) + C_2$. While this is not a pure power law, it is the limiting case of $x^{\\alpha}$ as $\\alpha \\to 0$. Formally, taking the limit of our expression for $\\kappa$:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\mu \\to (\\sigma^2/2)} \\left(1 - \\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2}\\right) \\;=\\; 1 - \\frac{2(\\sigma^2/2)}{\\sigma^2} \\;=\\; 1 - 1 \\;=\\; 0\n$$\nThis is consistent with the logarithmic behavior being a \"power law with exponent 0\". Therefore, the expression for $\\kappa$ is valid across all parameter regimes.\n\nThe exponent $\\kappa$ is given by the single expression:\n$$\n\\kappa \\;=\\; 1 - \\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2}\n$$\nThis is the value requested as the final answer. The provided solution's logic for this part is sound, even if its classification reasoning was flawed. The final answer relies only on the derivation of $\\kappa$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{1 - \\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2}} $$", "id": "3041573"}]}
