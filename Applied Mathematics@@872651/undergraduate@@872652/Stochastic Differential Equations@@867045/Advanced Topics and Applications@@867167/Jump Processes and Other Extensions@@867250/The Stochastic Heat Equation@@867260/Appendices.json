We will solve this initial value problem using the spatial Fourier transform, as specified.\n\nLet $\\widehat{u}(t, \\xi)$ denote the Fourier transform of the solution $u(t,x)$ with respect to the spatial variable $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$.

By making the change of variable $z = \\xi_j - \\frac{ix_j}{2t}$, the path of integration shifts to the complex line $\\mathbb{R} - i\\frac{x_j}{2t}$. Since the integrand $\\exp(-tz^2)$ is an entire function, by Cauchy's integral theorem we can shift the contour of integration back to the real axis without changing the value of the integral. Thus, we need to evaluate the standard Gaussian integral:\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-ty^2) dy = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{t}} $$\nSo, the value of $I_j$ is:\n$$ I_j = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x_j^2}{4t}\\right) \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{t}} $$\nNow, we can compute $p_t(x)$ by taking the product over all $j$ from $1$ to $d$:\n$$ p_t(x) = (2\\pi)^{-d} \\prod_{j=1}^d \\left[ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x_j^2}{4t}\\right) \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{t}} \\right] = (2\\pi)^{-d} \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{t}}\\right)^d \\prod_{j=1}^d \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x_j^2}{4t}\\right) $$\nThe product of the exponentials is $\\exp\\left(-\\sum_{j=1}^d \\frac{x_j^2}{4t}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|x|^2}{4t}\\right)$.\nThe constant factor is $(2\\pi)^{-d} (\\pi/t)^{d/2} = 2^{-d}\\pi^{-d}\\pi^{d/2}t^{-d/2} = 2^{-d}\\pi^{-d/2}t^{-d/2} = (4\\pi t)^{-d/2}$.\nCombining these results, we obtain the explicit expression for the fundamental solution, also known as the heat kernel:\n$$ p_t(x) = (4\\pi t)^{-d/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|x|^2}{4t}\\right) $$\nThis function represents a multivariate Gaussian probability density function in $x$ with mean $0$ and covariance matrix $2tI_d$, where $I_d$ is the $d \\times d$ identity matrix.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{(4\\pi t)^{-\\frac{d}{2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|x|^2}{4t}\\right)}$$", "id": "3081779"}, {"introduction": "With the heat kernel derived, we can now explore how it governs the evolution of an initial condition, a concept captured by the heat semigroup.

Let $v=t-s$, so $dv = -ds$. The limits of integration change from $s=0 \\implies v=t$ and $s=t \\implies v=0$.\n$$\n\\int_0^t e^{-2\\lambda_k (t-s)} ds = \\int_t^0 e^{-2\\lambda_k v} (-dv) = \\int_0^t e^{-2\\lambda_k v} dv\n$$\nThis integral evaluates to:\n$$\n\\int_0^t e^{-2\\lambda_k v} dv = \\left[ -\\frac{1}{2\\lambda_k} e^{-2\\lambda_k v} \\right]_0^t = -\\frac{1}{2\\lambda_k} (e^{-2\\lambda_k t} - e^0) = \\frac{1 - e^{-2\\lambda_k t}}{2\\lambda_k}\n$$\nThis calculation is valid because $\\lambda_k > 0$ is given.\nTherefore, the second moment of the $k$-th mode at time $t$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[|u_k(t)|^2] = q_k \\left( \\frac{1 - e^{-2\\lambda_k t}}{2\\lambda_k} \\right) = \\frac{q_k}{2\\lambda_k} (1 - e^{-2\\lambda_k t})\n$$\nFinally, we compute the required long-time limit as $t \\to \\infty$. Since $\\lambda_k > 0$, the exponential term vanishes in the limit:\n$$\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} e^{-2\\lambda_k t} = 0\n$$\nSubstituting this into our expression for the second moment, we obtain the final result:\n$$\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\mathbb{E}[|u_k(t)|^2] = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{q_k}{2\\lambda_k} (1 - e^{-2\\lambda_k t}) = \\frac{q_k}{2\\lambda_k} (1 - 0) = \\frac{q_k}{2\\lambda_k}\n$$\nThis result represents the stationary variance of the $k$-th mode of the solution, which is determined by the balance between the forcing from the noise (proportional to $q_k$) and the damping from the diffusion (proportional to $\\lambda_k$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{q_{k}}{2\\lambda_{k}}}$$", "id": "3081737"}]}
