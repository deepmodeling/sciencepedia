For the process $X_t$ with law $\\mu_t$, the integral term $\\int y\\,\\mu_t(\\mathrm{d}y)$ is the definition of the expectation of $X_t$. Let us denote this time-dependent mean as $m_t = \\mathbb{E}[X_t]$.\nThe diffusion coefficient is given as a constant, $\\sigma > 0$.\n\nFirst, we write the SDE explicitly in terms of $X_t$ and its expectation $\\mathbb{E}[X_t]$. Substituting $m_t$ into the expression for the drift, we get:\n$b(X_t, \\mu_t) = -X_t + \\mathbb{E}[X_t] = -X_t + m_t$.\nThe resulting SDE is:\n$$\\mathrm{d}X_t = (-X_t + m_t) \\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma \\,\\mathrm{d}W_t$$\n\nNext, we derive the evolution equation for the mean $m_t = \\mathbb{E}[X_t]$. We take the expectation of both sides of the SDE. Assuming we can interchange expectation and the differential operator (which is justified under standard assumptions for SDEs), we have $\\mathrm{d}\\mathbb{E}[X_t] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathrm{d}X_t]$.\n$$\\mathrm{d}m_t = \\mathbb{E}[(-X_t + m_t) \\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma \\,\\mathrm{d}W_t]$$\nBy the linearity of expectation:\n$$\\mathrm{d}m_t = \\mathbb{E}[-X_t + m_t] \\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\mathbb{E}[\\sigma \\,\\mathrm{d}W_t]$$\nFor a fixed time $t$, $m_t$ is a deterministic value. Thus, $\\mathbb{E}[-X_t + m_t] = -\\mathbb{E}[X_t] + \\mathbb{E}[m_t] = -m_t + m_t = 0$. The expectation of the stochastic differential $\\mathbb{E}[\\sigma \\,\\mathrm{d}W_t]$ is also $0$.\nThis simplifies the equation for $m_t$ to:\n$$\\mathrm{d}m_t = 0 \\cdot \\mathrm{d}t + 0$$\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}m_t}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 0$$\nThis is an ordinary differential equation whose solution is that $m_t$ is a constant. Therefore, $m_t = m_0$ for all $t \\ge 0$, where $m_0 = \\mathbb{E}[X_0]$ is the initial mean.\n\nNow, we derive the evolution equation for the variance $v_t = \\mathrm{Var}(X_t)$. The variance is defined as $v_t = \\mathbb{E}[(X_t - m_t)^2]$. Since we found that $m_t = m_0$ is constant, the variance is $v_t = \\mathbb{E}[(X_t - m_0)^2]$.\nLet us define a centered process $Y_t = X_t - m_0$. Since $m_0$ is a constant, the differential of $Y_t$ is $\\mathrm{d}Y_t = \\mathrm{d}X_t - \\mathrm{d}(m_0) = \\mathrm{d}X_t$.\nThe SDE for $X_t$ can be written as $\\mathrm{d}X_t = (-X_t + m_0) \\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma \\,\\mathrm{d}W_t$. We substitute $X_t = Y_t + m_0$ into this equation to find the SDE for $Y_t$:\n$$\\mathrm{d}Y_t = (-(Y_t + m_0) + m_0) \\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma \\,\\mathrm{d}W_t$$\n$$\\mathrm{d}Y_t = -Y_t \\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma \\,\\mathrm{d}W_t$$\nThe process $Y_t$ is a standard Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The variance of $X_t$ is $v_t = \\mathbb{E}[(X_t - m_0)^2] = \\mathbb{E}[Y_t^2]$.\nTo find the evolution of $v_t$, we apply Itô's formula to the function $f(y) = y^2$. The derivatives are $f'(y) = 2y$ and $f''(y) = 2$.\nItô's formula gives:\n$$\\mathrm{d}(Y_t^2) = f'(Y_t)\\,\\mathrm{d}Y_t + \\frac{1}{2}f''(Y_t)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\langle Y, Y \\rangle_t$$\nThe quadratic variation of $Y_t$ is $\\mathrm{d}\\langle Y, Y \\rangle_t = (\\sigma)^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}t = \\sigma^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}t$.

They are generated as independent random variables from a normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, \\Delta t)$, which is equivalent to $\\sqrt{\\Delta t} \\cdot Z_k^i$ where $Z_k^i \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$.\n\n4.  **Model-Specific Dynamics**: The drift $b$ and diffusion $\\sigma$ functions are implemented for each model:\n    - **Centered OU / Consensus**: $b(x, \\mu_k^N) = -\\alpha(x - m_k^N)$ and $\\sigma(x, \\mu_k^N) = \\beta$. The consensus model is a special case with $\\beta=0$.\n    - **Affine mean-driven**: $b(x, \\mu_k^N) = -\\alpha x + \\gamma m_k^N$ and $\\sigma(x, \\mu_k^N) = \\beta$.\n\n5.  **Final Statistics and Error Calculation**: After $K$ iterations, the simulation ends. The final particle positions are $\\{X_K^{i,N}\\}_{i=1}^N$.\n    - The **empirical mean** is calculated as $\\widehat{m}_T^N = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N X_K^{i,N}$.\n    - The **empirical variance** is calculated as $\\widehat{v}_T^N = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N (X_K^{i,N} - \\widehat{m}_T^N)^2$.\n    - The **analytical mean** $m_T$ and **analytical variance** $\\mathrm{Var}(X_T)$ are computed using the exact formulas provided in the problem description, taking care to distinguish between the cases $\\alpha > 0$ and $\\alpha=0$.\n    - Finally, the absolute errors are computed:\n      $$\n      \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{mean}} = \\big|\\widehat{m}_T^N - m_T\\big|\n      $$\n      $$\n      \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{var}} = \\big|\\widehat{v}_T^N - \\mathrm{Var}(X_T)\\big|\n      $$\n\nThis procedure is applied to each of the four test cases, and the eight resulting error values are collected and formatted as specified.
