A precise understanding of their distinct natures is critical for comprehending the phenomenon of propagation of chaos.\n\nThe core distinction lies in their dependence on the random outcome $\\omega \\in \\Omega$.\nThe empirical measure is defined as $\\mu_t^N := \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\delta_{X_t^{i,N}}$. The positions $X_t^{i,N}$ are random variables, functions from $\\Omega$ to $\\mathbb{R}^d$. For a specific realization $\\omega \\in \\Omega$, the values $X_t^{i,N}(\\omega)$ are fixed points in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, and $\\mu_t^N(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\delta_{X_t^{i,N}(\\omega)}$ is a specific, discrete probability measure on $\\mathbb{R}^d$.

The result is a single, fixed probability measure on $\\mathbb{R}^d$. It does not depend on any specific realization. Therefore, $\\mathcal{L}(X_t^{1,N})$ is a **deterministic probability measure**.\n\nWith this primary distinction established, we can evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. The empirical measure $\\mu_t^N$ is a random probability measure determined by the realized particle sample, whereas $\\mathcal{L}(X_t^{1,N})$ is a deterministic probability measure describing the distribution of a single tagged particle.**\nThis statement precisely captures the fundamental difference between the two objects, as explained above. $\\mu_t^N$ is a measure-valued random variable representing the state of the entire system for a single realization. $\\mathcal{L}(X_t^{1,N})$ is the probabilistic law of a single particle, averaged over all possible realizations.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. If the particle system is exchangeable, then $\\mu_t^N = \\mathcal{L}(X_t^{1,N})$ almost surely for each fixed $N$ and $t$.**\nThis statement is incorrect. It equates a random measure with a deterministic one. For this equality to hold almost surely, the random measure $\\mu_t^N$ must be constant (equal to the deterministic measure $\\mathcal{L}(X_t^{1,N})$) for almost all outcomes $\\omega$. This would imply that the particle positions $X_t^{i,N}$ are not genuinely random, which contradicts the premise of a stochastic particle system. For any finite $N$, $\\mu_t^N$ is a discrete measure (a sum of Dirac masses), while $\\mathcal{L}(X_t^{1,N})$ is often a continuous measure (e.g., if the particles follow SDEs with non-degenerate diffusion). They are fundamentally different types of measures.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. If the particle system has identical one-particle marginals (in particular, under exchangeability), then $\\mathbb{E}[\\mu_t^N] = \\mathcal{L}(X_t^{1,N})$ as probability measures.**\nThis statement describes the correct relationship between the two objects for finite $N$. Let us verify this by computing the expectation of $\\mu_t^N$. The expectation of a random measure is defined by its action on bounded measurable test functions $\\phi: \\mathbb{R}^d \\to \\mathbb{R}$.\n$$\n\\langle \\mathbb{E}[\\mu_t^N], \\phi \\rangle := \\mathbb{E}[\\langle \\mu_t^N, \\phi \\rangle]\n$$\nBy definition of $\\mu_t^N$, $\\langle \\mu_t^N, \\phi \\rangle = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^d} \\phi(x) \\mu_t^N(dx) = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\phi(X_t^{i,N})$.\nTaking the expectation and using its linearity:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\langle \\mu_t^N, \\phi \\rangle] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\phi(X_t^{i,N})\\right] = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\mathbb{E}[\\phi(X_t^{i,N})]\n$$\nThe expectation of a function of a random variable is the integral of the function against the law of the variable: $\\mathbb{E}[\\phi(X_t^{i,N})] = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^d} \\phi(x) d(\\mathcal{L}(X_t^{i,N}))(x)$.\nThe problem states the system has identical one-particle marginals, $\\mathcal{L}(X_t^{i,N}) = \\mathcal{L}(X_t^{1,N})$ for all $i=1, \\dots, N$. This is guaranteed by the exchangeability assumption.\nTherefore,\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\langle \\mu_t^N, \\phi \\rangle] = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^d} \\phi(x) d(\\mathcal{L}(X_t^{1,N}))(x) = \\frac{1}{N} \\cdot N \\cdot \\langle \\mathcal{L}(X_t^{1,N}), \\phi \\rangle = \\langle \\mathcal{L}(X_t^{1,N}), \\phi \\rangle\n$$\nSince this equality holds for all suitable test functions $\\phi$, it implies the equality of measures $\\mathbb{E}[\\mu_t^N] = \\mathcal{L}(X_t^{1,N})$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Under propagation of chaos, as $N \\to \\infty$, $\\mu_t^N$ converges weakly in probability to the same limit law $\\nu_t$ that is the weak limit of $\\mathcal{L}(X_t^{1,N})$, so they coincide in the $N \\to \\infty$ limit.**\nThis statement correctly summarizes the large-$N$ limit. The \"propagation of chaos\" property means two things happen simultaneously as $N \\to \\infty$:\n1. The empirical measure $\\mu_t^N$ converges to a deterministic measure $\\nu_t$. The mode of convergence is weak convergence of measures, in probability. This is a law of large numbers for interacting particles.\n2. The law of any single particle, $\\mathcal{L}(X_t^{1,N})$, also converges weakly to the same deterministic measure $\\nu_t$. This means the influence of all other $N-1$ particles on particle $1$ averages out in the limit to be described by the distribution $\\nu_t$.\nThe limit measure $\\nu_t$ is the solution to the McKean–Vlasov equation. Thus, while $\\mu_t^N$ and $\\mathcal{L}(X_t^{1,N})$ are distinct for any finite $N$, they share the same deterministic limit as $N \\to \\infty$. The statement accurately captures this asymptotic coincidence.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. For a fixed finite $N$, $\\mu_t^N = \\mathcal{L}(X_t^{1,N})$ if and only if the particles are independent and identically distributed.**\nThis is incorrect. First, as established in B, the equality $\\mu_t^N = \\mathcal{L}(X_t^{1,N})$ almost never holds for a non-trivial stochastic system because a random measure cannot equal a deterministic one. Second, assuming particles are i.i.d. with law $\\nu_t$ does not lead to this equality. If they are i.i.d., then $\\mathcal{L}(X_t^{1,N}) = \\nu_t$. The empirical measure $\\mu_t^N$ is still random. By the Glivenko-Cantelli theorem (a strong law of large numbers for empirical measures), $\\mu_t^N$ converges to $\\nu_t$ almost surely as $N \\to \\infty$, but for finite $N$, $\\mu_t^N \\neq \\nu_t$ almost surely. The condition of being i.i.d. is related to the *limit* behavior, not to an equality at finite $N$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**F. For $N=1$, the equality $\\mu_t^1=\\mathcal{L}(X_t^{1,1})$ holds as probability measures (without taking expectation).**\nThis is incorrect. It is a special case of the same fundamental fallacy seen in options B and E. For $N=1$, the empirical measure is $\\mu_t^1 = \\delta_{X_t^{1,1}}$, which is a random Dirac measure located at the random position of the single particle. The one-particle law is $\\mathcal{L}(X_t^{1,1})$, which is the deterministic probability distribution of that particle's position. For example, if $X_t^{1,1}$ is a one-dimensional Brownian motion starting at $0$, then $\\mathcal{L}(X_t^{1,1})$ is the Gaussian measure $\\mathcal{N}(0,t)$. A random Dirac mass $\\delta_{X_t^{1,1}}$ is not equal to a fixed Gaussian measure $\\mathcal{N}(0,t)$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "3070909"}, {"introduction": "With a clear grasp of the key players, our next step is to understand their dynamics.

Applying this property to $Z_t^{i}$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}Z_t^{i} = \\mathrm{d}\\left(X_t^{i,N} - \\bar{X}_t^{i}\\right) = \\mathrm{d}X_t^{i,N} - \\mathrm{d}\\bar{X}_t^{i}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $\\mathrm{d}X_t^{i,N}$ and $\\mathrm{d}\\bar{X}_t^{i}$ into this equation:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}Z_t^{i} = \\left[ b\\!\\left(X_t^{i,N}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j=1}^{N} K\\!\\left(X_t^{i,N} - X_t^{j,N}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma\\!\\left(X_t^{i,N}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t^{i} \\right] - \\left[ b\\!\\left(\\bar{X}_t^{i}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} K\\!\\left(\\bar{X}_t^{i} - y\\right)\\,\\mu_t(\\mathrm{d}y)\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sigma\\!\\left(\\bar{X}_t^{i}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t^{i} \\right]\n$$\nTo simplify, we group the terms associated with the time differential $\\mathrm{d}t$ (the drift terms) and the Brownian differential $\\mathrm{d}W_t^{i}$ (the diffusion terms).\n\nThe drift component is:\n$$\n\\left[ b\\!\\left(X_t^{i,N}\\right) - b\\!\\left(\\bar{X}_t^{i}\\right) \\right]\\mathrm{d}t + \\left[ \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j=1}^{N} K\\!\\left(X_t^{i,N} - X_t^{j,N}\\right) - \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} K\\!\\left(\\bar{X}_t^{i} - y\\right)\\,\\mu_t(\\mathrm{d}y) \\right]\\mathrm{d}t\n$$\nThe diffusion component is:\n$$\n\\left[ \\sigma\\!\\left(X_t^{i,N}\\right) - \\sigma\\!\\left(\\bar{X}_t^{i}\\right) \\right]\\mathrm{d}W_t^{i}\n$$\nThe cancellation of the Brownian motion term relies on the synchronous coupling.\n\nCombining these components gives the SDE for $Z_t^{i}$. We can consolidate the drift terms within a single parenthesis:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}Z_t^{i} = \\left[ b\\left(X_t^{i,N}\\right) - b\\left(\\bar{X}_t^{i}\\right) + \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{j=1}^{N} K\\left(X_t^{i,N} - X_t^{j,N}\\right) - \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} K\\left(\\bar{X}_t^{i} - y\\right)\\,\\mu_t(\\mathrm{d}y) \\right]\\mathrm{d}t + \\left[ \\sigma\\left(X_t^{i,N}\\right) - \\sigma\\left(\\bar{X}_t^{i}\\right) \\right]\\mathrm{d}W_t^{i}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the right-hand side of this equation expressed in terms of the given quantities.
