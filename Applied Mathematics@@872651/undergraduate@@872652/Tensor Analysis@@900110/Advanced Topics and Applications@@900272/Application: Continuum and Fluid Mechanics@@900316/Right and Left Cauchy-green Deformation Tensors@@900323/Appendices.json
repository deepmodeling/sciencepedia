This tensor relates an infinitesimal material line element $d\\mathbf{X}$ in the reference configuration to its corresponding element $d\\mathbf{x}$ in the current configuration via $d\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{F}d\\mathbf{X}$.\n\nTo analyze the local change in length and shape, the right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor, denoted by $\\mathbf{C}$, is defined as $\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{F}^T \\mathbf{F}$, where $\\mathbf{F}^T$ is the transpose of $\\mathbf{F}$.\n\nSuppose a continuous body undergoes a deformation such that its right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor is found to be the identity tensor, $\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{I}$, at every point within the body.
