For an $n$-dimensional closed, oriented manifold $M$, the pairing between a class $[\\alpha] \\in H^{k}_{dR}(M)$ and a class $[\\beta] \\in H^{n-k}_{dR}(M)$ is given by the integral $\\int_M \\alpha \\wedge \\beta$. In this problem, the manifold is $M = S^2$, so its dimension is $n=2$. The function $f \\equiv c$ is a $0$-form, so $k=0$. The area form $\\omega_g$ is a $2$-form, corresponding to $n-k=2-0 = 2$. The pairing is thus defined as\n$$\n\\langle [f],[\\omega_{g}] \\rangle = \\int_{S^{2}} f \\wedge \\omega_{g}.\n$$\nFor a $0$-form (a function) like $f$, the wedge product with another form is simply scalar multiplication. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\int_{S^{2}} f\\,\\omega_{g}.\n$$\nWe are given that $f$ is the constant function $f(p) = c$ for all points $p \\in S^2$, where $c$ is a fixed real constant. Substituting this into the integral, we have:\n$$\n\\int_{S^{2}} c\\,\\omega_{g}.\n$$\nSince $c$ is a constant, it can be factored out of the integral:\n$$\nc \\int_{S^{2}} \\omega_{g}.\n$$\nThe integral $\\int_{S^{2}} \\omega_{g}$ represents the total area of the manifold $S^2$ with respect to the metric $g$. The problem specifies that $S^2$ is the unit $2$-sphere in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ and $g$ is the standard round metric. The surface area of a sphere of radius $r$ is given by the formula $4\\pi r^2$. For the unit sphere, the radius is $r=1$. Thus, the area is:\n$$\n\\text{Area}(S^2) = \\int_{S^{2}} \\omega_{g} = 4\\pi (1)^2 = 4\\pi.\n$$\nSubstituting this value back into our expression for the pairing, we obtain:\n$$\n\\langle [f],[\\omega_{g}] \\rangle = c \\cdot (4\\pi) = 4\\pi c.\n$$\nThis is the value of the pairing.\n\nThe second part of the task is to interpret how this result demonstrates an obstruction to the exactness of $\\omega_g$. A differential form is called *closed* if its exterior derivative is zero. A differential form $\\alpha$ is called *exact* if it is the exterior derivative of another form $\\eta$, i.e., $\\alpha = d\\eta$.\n\nFirst, we note that $\\omega_g$ is a closed form. Since $\\omega_g$ is a $2$-form on a $2$-dimensional manifold $S^2$, its exterior derivative $d\\omega_g$ would be a $3$-form. The space of $k$-forms on an $n$-dimensional manifold is trivial for $k > n$. Thus, any $3$-form on $S^2$ must be identically zero, which means $d\\omega_g=0$. So, $\\omega_g$ is a closed $2$-form.\n\nThe question of whether $\\omega_g$ is exact is equivalent to asking if there exists a $1$-form $\\eta$ on $S^2$ such that $\\omega_g = d\\eta$. Let us assume, for the sake of contradiction, that $\\omega_g$ is exact. Then such a $1$-form $\\eta$ exists.\n\nWe now apply Stokes' theorem, which states that for any smooth oriented $m$-dimensional manifold $M$ with boundary $\\partial M$ and any smooth $(m-1)$-form $\\alpha$, we have $\\int_{M} d\\alpha = \\int_{\\partial M} \\alpha$.\nIn our case, the manifold is $M=S^2$, which is $2$-dimensional, and the form being integrated is $\\omega_g = d\\eta$ (our assumption). Applying Stokes' theorem gives:\n$$\n\\int_{S^{2}} \\omega_{g} = \\int_{S^{2}} d\\eta.\n$$\nAccording to the theorem, this must be equal to the integral of $\\eta$ over the boundary of $S^2$:\n$$\n\\int_{S^{2}} d\\eta = \\int_{\\partial S^{2}} \\eta.\n$$\nThe unit sphere $S^2$ is a closed manifold, meaning it is compact and has no boundary. Therefore, its boundary $\\partial S^2$ is the empty set, $\\emptyset$. The integral of any form over the empty set is defined to be zero.\n$$\n\\int_{\\partial S^{2}} \\eta = 0.\n$$\nThis implies that if $\\omega_g$ were an exact form, its integral over $S^2$ must be zero:\n$$\n\\int_{S^{2}} \\omega_{g} = 0.\n$$\nHowever, we have already established that this integral is the area of the unit sphere, which is $4\\pi$. We have the contradiction:\n$$\n4\\pi = 0.\n$$\nThis contradiction proves that our initial assumption was false. Therefore, $\\omega_g$ cannot be an exact form.\n\nThe value of the pairing $\\langle [f],[\\omega_g] \\rangle = 4\\pi c$ is the obstruction. For any non-zero constant $c$, the function $f \\equiv c$ represents a non-trivial cohomology class $[f] \\in H^0_{dR}(S^2)$. The non-degeneracy of the Poincaré pairing requires that if a cohomology class $[\\omega_g] \\in H^2_{dR}(S^2)$ is non-zero, then there must exist some class $[f] \\in H^0_{dR}(S^2)$ such that their pairing is non-zero. Our calculation shows that for any choice of $c \\neq 0$, the pairing is indeed non-zero. This directly demonstrates that the cohomology class $[\\omega_g]$ is not the zero class in $H^2_{dR}(S^2)$. Since a closed form is exact if and only if it represents the zero cohomology class, the non-vanishing integral/pairing proves that $\\omega_g$ is not exact.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4\\pi c}\n$$", "id": "2971190"}]}
