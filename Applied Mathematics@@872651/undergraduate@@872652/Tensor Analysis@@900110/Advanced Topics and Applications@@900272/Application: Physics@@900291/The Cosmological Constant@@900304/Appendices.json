Consider a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe, which is a standard model for the large-scale structure of our cosmos. For such a universe, the spacetime interval $ds$ in a coordinate system where the coordinates are indexed as $(x^0, x^1, x^2, x^3) = (t, x, y, z)$ is given by the line element:\n$$ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + a(t)^2 (dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2)$$\nThis metric corresponds to a signature of $(-,+,+,+)$.

The cosmological constant introduces a new, non-gravitational fundamental force that acts on the test particle, with a magnitude proportional to its distance from the origin.\n\nB.
