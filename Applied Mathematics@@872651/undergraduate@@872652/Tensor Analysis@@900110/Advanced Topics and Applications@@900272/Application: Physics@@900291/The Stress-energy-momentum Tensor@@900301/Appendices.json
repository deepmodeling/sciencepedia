The pressure is anisotropic, with principal values $p_x$, $p_y$, and $p_z$ directed along the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes, respectively.

Since the substance is at rest in this frame, the measured energy density is equal to the proper energy density. Therefore, $T^{00} = \\rho$.\n\n2.  **$T^{0i}$ and $T^{i0}$ (Energy Flux and Momentum Density):** The substance is stationary in the laboratory frame. This means there is no net flow of energy (energy flux) and no momentum per unit volume (momentum density). Therefore, for $i=1, 2, 3$, we have $T^{0i} = 0$ and $T^{i0} = 0$.\n\n3.  **$T^{ij}$ (Spatial Stress Tensor):** This $3 \\times 3$ block describes the stresses within the substance.\n    -   The off-diagonal components $T^{ij}$ (for $i \\neq j$) represent shear stresses. The problem specifies that there are no shear stresses, so these components are all zero.\n    -   The diagonal components $T^{ii}$ (no summation) represent normal stresses. For a fluid or solid, this is pressure (or tension). The problem gives these as the principal pressures $p_x, p_y, p_z$ along the corresponding axes.
