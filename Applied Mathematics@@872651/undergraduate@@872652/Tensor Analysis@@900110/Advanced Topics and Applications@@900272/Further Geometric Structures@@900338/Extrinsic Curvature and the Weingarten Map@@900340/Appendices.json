The mean curvature of the surface at $p_0$ is non-zero, but the Gaussian curvature is zero.", "solution": "The problem asks for the geometric interpretation of the Weingarten map being the zero map at a point $p_0$ on a surface $S$.\n\nFirst, let's recall the fundamental properties of the Weingarten map, $L_p$. The eigenvalues of the Weingarten map at a point $p$ are the principal curvatures of the surface at that point, denoted $\\kappa_1$ and $\\kappa_2$. The corresponding eigenvectors are the principal directions.\n\nThe matrix representation of a linear transformation is the zero matrix in some basis if and only if the transformation itself is the zero map.

At such a point, the second fundamental form is identically zero. Geometrically, this means that the surface does not curve in any direction at $p_0$. To first order, any smooth surface is approximated by its tangent plane. For a planar point, this approximation is exceptionally good, as the quadratic corrections that describe curvature vanish. The surface in the immediate vicinity of $p_0$ is therefore best described as being flat, like a plane.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options based on this conclusion:\n\nA. A saddle point is defined by having principal curvatures of opposite signs, i.e., $\\kappa_1 > 0$ and $\\kappa_2 < 0$ (or vice versa). This implies a non-zero Weingarten map. So, A is incorrect.\n\nB. An umbilical point is a point where the principal curvatures are equal, $\\kappa_1 = \\kappa_2$. A point on a sphere of radius $R$ is an umbilical point with $\\kappa_1 = \\kappa_2 = 1/R \\neq 0$ (for a finite radius). While a planar point is technically an umbilical point (since $0=0$), the specific mention of a sphere implies non-zero curvature. Moreover, the most precise description is \"planar,\" not just \"umbilical.\" So, B is not the best description.\n\nC. A planar point is precisely a point where $\\kappa_1 = \\kappa_2 = 0$. This corresponds to a locally flat geometry, resembling a plane. This statement is correct.\n\nD. The Gaussian curvature $K$ is the determinant of the Weingarten map, which is equal to the product of the principal curvatures: $K = \\det(L_p) = \\kappa_1 \\kappa_2$. If $\\kappa_1 = \\kappa_2 = 0$, then the Gaussian curvature is $K = 0 \\times 0 = 0$. It is not infinite. So, D is incorrect.\n\nE. The mean curvature $H$ is half the trace of the Weingarten map, which is equal to the average of the principal curvatures: $H = \\frac{1}{2}\\text{tr}(L_p) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\kappa_1 + \\kappa_2)$. If $\\kappa_1 = \\kappa_2 = 0$, then the mean curvature is $H = \\frac{1}{2}(0 + 0) = 0$. The statement claims the mean curvature is non-zero.
