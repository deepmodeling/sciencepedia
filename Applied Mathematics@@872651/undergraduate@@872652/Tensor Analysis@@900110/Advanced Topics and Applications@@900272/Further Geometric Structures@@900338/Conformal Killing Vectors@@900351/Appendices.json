For this equality to hold true for all $x$ and $y$, both sides must be equal to the same constant. Let's call this constant $c$.\n$$ \\frac{df}{dx} = c \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{dg}{dy} = c $$\nWe can solve these simple ordinary differential equations by direct integration.\nFor $f(x)$, we integrate with respect to $x$:\n$$ \\int \\frac{df}{dx} dx = \\int c \\, dx \\implies f(x) = cx + a $$\nwhere $a$ is an arbitrary constant of integration.\nFor $g(y)$, we integrate with respect to $y$:\n$$ \\int \\frac{dg}{dy} dy = \\int c \\, dy \\implies g(y) = cy + b $$\nwhere $b$ is another arbitrary constant of integration.\n\nTherefore, the most general forms for the functions are $f(x) = cx + a$ and $g(y) = cy + b$, where $a, b,$ and $c$ are arbitrary constants.
