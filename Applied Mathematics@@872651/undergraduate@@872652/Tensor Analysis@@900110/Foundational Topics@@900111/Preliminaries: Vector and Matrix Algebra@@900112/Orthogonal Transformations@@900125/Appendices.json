Consider a transformation from an initial coordinate system $(x,y)$ to a new coordinate system $(x',y')$. This transformation is described by a set of linear equations that relate the new coordinates to the old ones:\n$x' = c x + c y$\n$y' = -c x + c y$\nwhere $c$ is a real, positive constant.\nFor this transformation to represent a pure, rigid rotation of the coordinate system, without any scaling (stretching/shrinking) or reflection, the underlying transformation matrix must satisfy specific mathematical properties.

This implies two conditions must be met:\n1.  The matrix must be orthogonal, meaning it preserves lengths and angles. This corresponds to the \"rigid\" and \"no scaling\" requirement. Mathematically, an orthogonal matrix satisfies the condition $A^T A = I$, where $A^T$ is the transpose of $A$ and $I$ is the identity matrix.\n2.  The matrix must have a determinant of +1. This ensures the orientation of the coordinate system is preserved, which corresponds to the \"no reflection\" requirement. Mathematically, $\\det(A) = 1$.\n\nWe will now apply these two conditions to the matrix $A$.\n\nFirst, let's impose the orthogonality condition, $A^T A = I$.

This gives us the equation:\n$$2c^2 = 1$$\n\nNext, let's impose the determinant condition, $\\det(A) = 1$. The determinant of matrix $A$ is:\n$$\\det(A) = (c)(c) - (c)(-c) = c^2 + c^2 = 2c^2$$\nSetting the determinant equal to 1 gives us the equation:\n$$2c^2 = 1$$\n\nBoth conditions independently lead to the same equation for $c$.
