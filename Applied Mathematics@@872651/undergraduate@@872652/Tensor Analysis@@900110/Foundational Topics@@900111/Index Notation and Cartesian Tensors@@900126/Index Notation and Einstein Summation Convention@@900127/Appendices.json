The convention states that when an index variable appears twice in a single term, summation over all possible values of that index is implied. For example, in a 3-dimensional space where indices run from 1 to 3, the expression for the dot product, $v_i w_i$, is a shorthand for the sum $v_1 w_1 + v_2 w_2 + v_3 w_3$.\n\nConsider an abstract 4-dimensional space where indices, such as $i$ and $j$, can each take on any integer value from 1 to 4. Two rank-2 tensors, $A$ and $B$, are defined in this space, with components denoted by $A_{ij}$ and $B_{ij}$, respectively. An operation involving these tensors is represented by the expression $A_{ij} B_{ij}$.\n\nApplying the Einstein summation convention, determine the total number of individual product terms (e.g., a term like $A_{23}B_{23}$) that are present in the full expansion of the expression $A_{ij} B_{ij}$.

The Einstein summation convention implies that we must sum over both index $i$ and index $j$ because each appears twice in the expression (once as a subscript and once as a superscript, although in this Euclidean context the position does not change the value of the Kronecker delta). Since the space is 3-dimensional, the indices $i$ and $j$ range from 1 to 3.\n\nThe expression $\\delta_{ij}\\delta^{ij}$ is a concise way of writing the double summation:\n$$\n\\delta_{ij}\\delta^{ij} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\delta_{ij} \\delta^{ij}\n$$\nThe problem statement gives the definition of the Kronecker delta, $\\delta_{ij}$, which is 1 if $i=j$ and 0 if $i \\neq j$. The same definition applies to $\\delta^{ij}$. Therefore, the product $\\delta_{ij}\\delta^{ij}$ is non-zero only when the condition $i=j$ is met. If $i \\neq j$, then $\\delta_{ij}=0$, and the term $\\delta_{ij}\\delta^{ij}$ becomes $0 \\cdot \\delta^{ij} = 0$.\n\nConsequently, we only need to sum the terms for which $i=j$:\n$$\n\\delta_{ij}\\delta^{ij} = \\sum_{i=j} \\delta_{ij} \\delta^{ij} = \\delta_{11}\\delta^{11} + \\delta_{22}\\delta^{22} + \\delta_{33}\\delta^{33}\n$$\nAll other terms in the nine-term expansion of the double sum, such as $\\delta_{12}\\delta^{12}$ or $\\delta_{21}\\delta^{21}$, are zero.\n\nAccording to the definition of the Kronecker delta:\n$\\delta_{11} = 1$ and $\\delta^{11} = 1$\n$\\delta_{22} = 1$ and $\\delta^{22} = 1$\n$\\delta_{33} = 1$ and $\\delta^{33} = 1$\n\nSubstituting these values into our sum:\n$$\n\\delta_{ij}\\delta^{ij} = (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n$$\nAlternatively, we can perform the summation one index at a time.

Specifically, $\\delta_{ij}$ is 1 only when $j=i$. So, the sum simplifies to just the term where $j=i$:\n$$\n\\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\delta_{ij} \\delta^{ij} = \\delta_{ii}\\delta^{ii} = (1)(1) = 1\n$$\nThis result holds for any choice of $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.
