The trace is explicitly defined as the sum of the diagonal components, $\\text{Tr}(\\mathbf{g}) = g_{11} + g_{22}$.\n\nFirst, let's write the general expression for a line element $ds^2$ in a two-dimensional space with coordinates $(x^1, x^2)$. Using the Einstein summation convention, this is:\n$$ds^2 = g_{ij} dx^i dx^j = \\sum_{i=1}^{2} \\sum_{j=1}^{2} g_{ij} dx^i dx^j$$\nExpanding the sums, we get:\n$$ds^2 = g_{11} (dx^1)^2 + g_{12} dx^1 dx^2 + g_{21} dx^2 dx^1 + g_{22} (dx^2)^2$$\nThe metric tensor is symmetric, which means $g_{ij} = g_{ji}$, so we have $g_{12} = g_{21}$. Combining the cross-terms, the expression becomes:\n$$ds^2 = g_{11} (dx^1)^2 + 2g_{12} dx^1 dx^2 + g_{22} (dx^2)^2$$\n\nIn our specific problem, the coordinates are given as $(x^1, x^2) = (r, \\theta)$.

In the given line element, there is no $dr d\\theta$ term, which means its coefficient is zero:\n$$2g_{12} = 0 \\implies g_{12} = 0$$\nSince the metric tensor is symmetric, $g_{21} = g_{12} = 0$.\n\nThe trace of the matrix representation of the metric tensor is defined as $\\text{Tr}(\\mathbf{g}) = g_{11} + g_{22}$.
