While the one-form itself is a coordinate-independent geometric object, its component representation changes with the coordinate system.

A one-form, also known as a covector field, is given by the expression:\n$$ \\omega = (x^2 + 2y) dx + (y - x^2) dy $$\nNow, consider a change of coordinates to a new system $(u, v)$ defined by the linear transformation:\n$$ u = x + y $$\n$$ v = x - y $$\nIn this new coordinate system, the one-form $\\omega$ can be written in terms of the new basis one-forms $du$ and $dv$ as $\\omega = \\omega_u(u,v) du + \\omega_v(u,v) dv$. Determine the component functions $\\omega_u(u,v)$ and $\\omega_v(u,v)$.\n\nYour final answer should be presented as a row matrix containing the two functions, in the format $\\begin{pmatrix} \\omega_u(u,v) & \\omega_v(u,v) \\end{pmatrix}$.", "solution": "To find the components of the one-form $\\omega$ in the new coordinate system $(u, v)$, we must express the original basis one-forms $dx$ and $dy$ in terms of the new basis one-forms $du$ and $dv$. We must also express the component functions, originally in terms of $x$ and $y$, as functions of $u$ and $v$.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the basis one-forms. The coordinate transformation is given by $u = x + y$ and $v = x - y$. We take the total differential of these two equations:\n$$ du = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} dy = (1)dx + (1)dy = dx + dy $$\n$$ dv = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} dx + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} dy = (1)dx + (-1)dy = dx - dy $$\nThis gives us a system of two linear equations for $dx$ and $dy$:\n1. $dx + dy = du$\n2. $dx - dy = dv$\n\nTo solve for $dx$, we add the two equations: $(dx+dy) + (dx-dy) = du+dv$, which simplifies to $2dx = du + dv$. Therefore, $dx = \\frac{1}{2}(du + dv)$.\nTo solve for $dy$, we subtract the second equation from the first: $(dx+dy) - (dx-dy) = du-dv$, which simplifies to $2dy = du - dv$. Therefore, $dy = \\frac{1}{2}(du - dv)$.\n\nNext, we substitute these expressions for $dx$ and $dy$ into the definition of $\\omega$:\n$$ \\omega = (x^2 + 2y) \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(du + dv) \\right] + (y - x^2) \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(du - dv) \\right] $$\nWe regroup the terms by the new basis one-forms $du$ and $dv$:\n$$ \\omega = \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 + 2y) + \\frac{1}{2}(y - x^2) \\right] du + \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 + 2y) - \\frac{1}{2}(y - x^2) \\right] dv $$\nThe coefficient of $du$ is the component $\\omega_u$, and the coefficient of $dv$ is the component $\\omega_v$. Let's simplify these coefficients, which are currently functions of $x$ and $y$.\n$$ \\omega_u(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 + 2y + y - x^2) = \\frac{1}{2}(3y) = \\frac{3}{2}y $$\n$$ \\omega_v(x, y) = \\frac{1}{2}(x^2 + 2y - y + x^2) = \\frac{1}{2}(2x^2 + y) = x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}y $$\n\nFinally, we must express these components in terms of the new coordinates $u$ and $v$. We need the inverse transformation. From the original transformation equations $u = x + y$ and $v = x - y$:\nAdding them gives $u + v = 2x$, so $x = \\frac{1}{2}(u + v)$.\nSubtracting them gives $u - v = 2y$, so $y = \\frac{1}{2}(u - v)$.\n\nNow we substitute these into our expressions for $\\omega_u$ and $\\omega_v$:\n$$ \\omega_u(u, v) = \\frac{3}{2}y = \\frac{3}{2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(u - v) \\right] = \\frac{3}{4}(u - v) $$\n$$ \\omega_v(u, v) = x^2 + \\frac{1}{2}y = \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(u + v) \\right]^2 + \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(u - v) \\right] $$\n$$ \\omega_v(u, v) = \\frac{1}{4}(u + v)^2 + \\frac{1}{4}(u - v) $$\n$$ \\omega_v(u, v) = \\frac{1}{4} \\left[ (u^2 + 2uv + v^2) + (u - v) \\right] $$\n$$ \\omega_v(u, v) = \\frac{1}{4}(u^2 + v^2 + u - v + 2uv) $$\n\nSo, the two component functions in the new coordinate system are $\\omega_u(u,v) = \\frac{3}{4}(u - v)$ and $\\omega_v(u,v) = \\frac{1}{4}(u^2 + v^2 + u - v + 2uv)$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{3}{4}(u - v) & \\frac{1}{4}(u^2 + v^2 + u - v + 2uv) \\end{pmatrix}} $$", "id": "1528015"}, {"introduction": "In physics and mathematics, many important fields can be expressed as the gradient of a potential.
