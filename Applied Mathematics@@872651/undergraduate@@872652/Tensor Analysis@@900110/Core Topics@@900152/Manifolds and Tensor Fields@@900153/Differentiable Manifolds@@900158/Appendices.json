If the surface is described as a level set of a function $F(x,y,z) = c$, the vector $v$ must be orthogonal to the gradient of $F$ evaluated at the point $p$. That is, $\\nabla F(p) \\cdot v = 0$. The point $p$ must also be a regular point of the surface, meaning $\\nabla F(p) \\neq \\mathbf{0}$.\n\nWe will analyze each scenario based on these two conditions.\n\n**Scenario 1:**\nThe surface is $S: x^2 + 2y^2 + 3z^2 = 9$, the point is $p=(2,1,1)$, and the vector is $v=(1,2,-2)$.\n1.  Check if $p$ is on $S$: Substitute the coordinates of $p$ into the equation for $S$.\n    $2^2 + 2(1)^2 + 3(1)^2 = 4 + 2 + 3 = 9$. The equation holds, so $p$ is on the surface $S$.\n2.  Check for orthogonality with the gradient. Define $F(x,y,z) = x^2 + 2y^2 + 3z^2$. The gradient is $\\nabla F = (2x, 4y, 6z)$.\n    Evaluate the gradient at $p=(2,1,1)$:\n    $\\nabla F(p) = (2(2), 4(1), 6(1)) = (4, 4, 6)$.\n    This is a non-zero vector, so $p$ is a regular point.\n    Now, take the dot product of $v$ and $\\nabla F(p)$:\n    $v \\cdot \\nabla F(p) = (1,2,-2) \\cdot (4,4,6) = (1)(4) + (2)(4) + (-2)(6) = 4 + 8 - 12 = 0$.\n    Since the dot product is zero, $v$ is orthogonal to the gradient.\nConclusion for Scenario 1: Both conditions are met. Thus, $v$ is a tangent vector to $S$ at $p$.\n\n**Scenario 2:**\nThe surface is $S: z = x^2 - y^2$, the point is $p=(2,1,4)$, and the vector is $v=(1,2,1)$.\n1.  Check if $p$ is on $S$: Substitute the coordinates of $p$ into the equation. For the point $(2,1,4)$, we have $x=2, y=1, z=4$. The equation requires $z = x^2 - y^2$.\n    $4 \\stackrel{?}{=} 2^2 - 1^2 = 4 - 1 = 3$.\n    Since $4 \\neq 3$, the point $p$ does not lie on the surface $S$.\nConclusion for Scenario 2: The first condition is not met. A vector cannot be tangent to a surface at a point that is not on the surface. Thus, $v$ is not a tangent vector to $S$ at $p$.\n\n**Scenario 3:**\nThe surface is $S: \\exp(x-1) + yz = 5$, the point is $p=(1,2,2)$, and the vector is $v=(2,1,-2)$.\n1.  Check if $p$ is on $S$: Substitute the coordinates of $p$ into the equation.\n    $\\exp(1-1) + (2)(2) = \\exp(0) + 4 = 1 + 4 = 5$. The equation holds, so $p$ is on the surface $S$.\n2.

Thus, $v$ is a tangent vector to $S$ at $p$.\n\n**Scenario 4:**\nThe surface is $S: z^2 = x^2+y^2$, the point is $p=(3,4,5)$, and the vector is $v=(4,-3,1)$.\n1.  Check if $p$ is on $S$: Substitute the coordinates of $p$ into the equation.\n    $5^2 = 25$. $3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25$. The equation holds, so $p$ is on the surface $S$.\n2.  Check for orthogonality. Define $F(x,y,z) = x^2+y^2-z^2$. The gradient is $\\nabla F = (2x, 2y, -2z)$.\n    Evaluate the gradient at $p=(3,4,5)$:\n    $\\nabla F(p) = (2(3), 2(4), -2(5)) = (6, 8, -10)$.\n    This is a non-zero vector (since $p \\neq (0,0,0)$), so $p$ is a regular point.\n    Now, take the dot product of $v$ and $\\nabla F(p)$:\n    $v \\cdot \\nabla F(p) = (4,-3,1) \\cdot (6,8,-10) = (4)(6) + (-3)(8) + (1)(-10) = 24 - 24 - 10 = -10$.\n    Since the dot product is not zero, $v$ is not orthogonal to the gradient.\nConclusion for Scenario 4: The second condition is not met. Thus, $v$ is not a tangent vector to $S$ at $p$.\n\nSummary of Conclusions:\n- Scenario 1: Valid tangent vector.\n- Scenario 2: Not a tangent vector (point not on surface).\n- Scenario 3: Valid tangent vector.\n- Scenario 4: Not a tangent vector (not orthogonal to gradient).\n\nThe scenarios that correctly identify a tangent vector are 1 and 3.
