This problem asks you to reason about the motion of a rigid, rotating disk, a classic example of an incompressible flow. By thinking conceptually about the properties of the material flow, you can deduce that the divergence of its velocity field must be zero, linking the mathematical concept to the physical reality of constant volume [@problem_id:2140595].", "problem": "A rigid, uniform disk rotates with a constant angular velocity $\\omega$ about the z-axis, which passes perpendicularly through its center. The motion of any point $(x, y, z)$ within the disk can be described by the velocity vector field $\\mathbf{v}(x, y, z) = \\langle -\\omega y, \\omega x, 0 \\rangle$. The divergence of this vector field is known to be zero. Without performing any calculations, select the option that provides the correct physical justification for why the divergence of the velocity field for any rigid body rotation must be zero.\n\nA. The acceleration of every point within the disk is zero because the angular velocity is constant.\n\nB. The velocity of every point within the disk is constant, leading to a static field with zero divergence.\n\nC. The flow is irrotational, and irrotational fields always have zero divergence.\n\nD. As a rigid body, the disk is incompressible; any small volume element within it maintains its volume as it moves, implying no local expansion or compression.\n\nE. At every point, the velocity vector is perpendicular to the position vector, which is a mathematical condition for zero divergence.", "solution": "The physical meaning of the divergence of a velocity field is the instantaneous volumetric expansion rate of a material element moving with the flow.

Hence, the correct justification is that a rigid body is incompressible in this kinematic sense: there is no local expansion or compression of volume elements. This corresponds to option D. Options A, B, C, and E do not capture this volumetric argument: accelerations are not zero in uniform rotation, the velocity field is not spatially constant, rigid rotation is not irrotational, and orthogonality of velocity to position does not imply zero divergence.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2140595"}, {"introduction": "This final practice demonstrates the practical application of divergence in solving physical problems, specifically using Gauss's Law from electromagnetism.
