To find this, we must use the fundamental algebraic symmetries of the fully covariant Riemann tensor, $R_{abcd}$.\n\nOne of the fundamental symmetries, often called the first algebraic symmetry or antisymmetry in the last two indices, states that the tensor is antisymmetric with respect to the interchange of its last two indices.
