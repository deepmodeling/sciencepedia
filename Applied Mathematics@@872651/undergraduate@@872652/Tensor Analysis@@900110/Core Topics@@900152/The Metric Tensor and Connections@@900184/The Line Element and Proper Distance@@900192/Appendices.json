The non-zero components are $g_{11} = 1$ and $g_{22} = (x^1)^4$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\nds^2 = \\left(g_{11}\\left(\\frac{dx^1}{dt}\\right)^2 + g_{22}\\left(\\frac{dx^2}{dt}\\right)^2\\right) dt^2\n$$\nThe path is given by the parametric equations:\n$$\nx^1(t) = t^2\n$$\n$$\nx^2(t) = \\frac{1}{t}\n$$\nFirst, we find the derivatives of the coordinates with respect to the parameter $t$:\n$$\n\\frac{dx^1}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(t^2) = 2t\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dx^2}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{1}{t}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{t^2}\n$$\nNext, we need to express the metric component $g_{22}$ in terms of the parameter $t$. We substitute $x^1(t)$ into the expression for $g_{22}$:\n$$\ng_{22} = (x^1)^4 = (t^2)^4 = t^8\n$$\nNow we can assemble the term under the square root in the arc length integral:\n$$\ng_{\\mu\\nu} \\frac{dx^\\mu}{dt} \\frac{dx^\\nu}{dt} = g_{11}\\left(\\frac{dx^1}{dt}\\right)^2 + g_{22}\\left(\\frac{dx^2}{dt}\\right)^2 = (1)(2t)^2 + (t^8)\\left(-\\frac{1}{t^2}\\right)^2\n$$\n$$\n= 4t^2 + t^8 \\left(\\frac{1}{t^4}\\right) = 4t^2 + t^4 = t^2(4 + t^2)\n$$\nThe line element is therefore:\n$$\nds = \\sqrt{t^2(4 + t^2)} dt = |t|\\sqrt{4 + t^2} dt\n$$\nThe integration is over the interval from $t=1$ to $t=2$. In this interval, $t > 0$, so $|t|=t$. The integral for the arc length $L$ is:\n$$\nL = \\int_{1}^{2} t\\sqrt{4 + t^2} dt\n$$\nTo solve this integral, we use a u-substitution. Let $u = 4 + t^2$.
