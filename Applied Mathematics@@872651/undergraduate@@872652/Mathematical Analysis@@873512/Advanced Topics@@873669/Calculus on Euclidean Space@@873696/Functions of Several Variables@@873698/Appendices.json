Much like a topographical map shows lines of constant elevation on a mountain, level sets of a function $f(x,y)$ are curves where the function's value is constant. This practice explores how the shape and connectivity—the topology—of these level sets change as we vary the constant value, revealing the locations of valleys (local minima), peaks (local maxima), and mountain passes (saddle points) in the function's landscape [@problem_id:2299928].", "problem": "In the study of two-dimensional materials, the potential energy $V$ of an electron moving on a surface can often be modeled by a periodic function. Consider a simplified model where the potential energy in some normalized units is given by the function $V(x,y) = y^2 - \\cos(x)$, where $x$ and $y$ are spatial coordinates. An electron is constrained to move along paths of constant energy, known as equipotential lines, which are defined by the equation $V(x,y) = E$ for some constant energy level $E$.\n\nThe topological nature of these paths dictates the electron's transport properties. For very low energies, the electron may be trapped, while for high energies it may be free to move throughout the material. We are interested in how the topology of the set of all possible electron paths (the level set for a given energy $E$) changes as the energy level $E$ increases from values less than -1 to values greater than 1.\n\nWhich of the following statements accurately describes the qualitative sequence of changes in the topology of the set of all possible electron paths as $E$ increases?\n\nA. For $E < -1$, the set is empty. At $E = -1$, it becomes a set of isolated points. For $-1 < E < 1$, it is a set of disjoint closed loops. At $E=1$, these loops merge into a single connected network.

At $E=-1$, it becomes a set of isolated points. For $-1 < E < 1$, it is a set of disjoint closed loops. At $E=1$, these loops break apart into two disjoint unbounded curves without first merging.", "solution": "The problem asks for a description of the topology of the level sets of the function $V(x,y) = y^2 - \\cos(x)$ for different values of the energy level $E$. The level sets are defined by the equation $V(x,y) = E$, which translates to:\n$$y^2 - \\cos(x) = E$$\nWe can rewrite this as:\n$$y^2 = E + \\cos(x)$$\nFor real solutions $(x,y)$ to exist, the right-hand side must be non-negative, i.e., $E + \\cos(x) \\ge 0$.\n\nThe topology of the level sets changes at the critical values of the function $V(x,y)$. A critical point occurs where the gradient of $V$ is zero. Let's find the critical points:\n$\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial x} = \\sin(x) = 0 \\implies x = n\\pi$ for any integer $n$.\n$\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y} = 2y = 0 \\implies y = 0$.\nThe critical points are $(n\\pi, 0)$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nLet's evaluate the energy $E$ at these critical points:\n$E = V(n\\pi, 0) = 0^2 - \\cos(n\\pi) = -\\cos(n\\pi)$.\nIf $n$ is an even integer ($n=2k$), then $\\cos(2k\\pi) = 1$, so the critical energy level is $E = -1$. These points correspond to local minima of the potential energy.\nIf $n$ is an odd integer ($n=2k+1$), then $\\cos((2k+1)\\pi) = -1$, so the critical energy level is $E = 1$. These points correspond to saddle points of the potential energy.\n\nThe critical energy values are $E=-1$ and $E=1$. We will now analyze the topology of the level sets by considering intervals of $E$ separated by these critical values.\n\nCase I: $E < -1$\nThe level set equation is $y^2 = E + \\cos(x)$.\nSince the maximum value of $\\cos(x)$ is 1, the maximum value of the right-hand side is $E+1$.\nGiven $E < -1$, we have $E+1 < 0$. Therefore, $E + \\cos(x) \\le E+1 < 0$ for all $x$.\nThe equation $y^2 = (\\text{a negative number})$ has no real solutions for $y$.\nThus, for $E < -1$, the level set is the empty set.\n\nCase II: $E = -1$\nThe equation becomes $y^2 = -1 + \\cos(x)$.\nSince $y^2 \\ge 0$, we must have $-1 + \\cos(x) \\ge 0$, which implies $\\cos(x) \\ge 1$.\nAs the maximum value of $\\cos(x)$ is 1, the only possibility is $\\cos(x)=1$. This occurs when $x = 2k\\pi$ for any integer $k$.\nAt these $x$ values, the equation becomes $y^2 = -1 + 1 = 0$, which gives $y=0$.\nSo, the level set is the set of points $\\{(2k\\pi, 0) \\mid k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\}$. This is a countably infinite set of isolated points.\n\nCase III: $-1 < E < 1$\nThe equation is $y^2 = E + \\cos(x)$.\nFor real solutions to exist, we need $E + \\cos(x) \\ge 0$, or $\\cos(x) \\ge -E$.\nSince $-1 < E < 1$, we have $-1 < -E < 1$. The condition $\\cos(x) \\ge -E$ is satisfied on a set of disjoint intervals along the $x$-axis. For example, for a single period, there is an interval $[-\\arccos(-E), \\arccos(-E)]$ around $x=0$, and another interval around $x=2\\pi$, and so on.\nWithin each such interval, for a given $x$, we have two $y$ values, $y = \\pm\\sqrt{E+\\cos(x)}$. At the endpoints of these intervals, where $\\cos(x) = -E$, we have $y=0$.\nThis structure forms a closed loop (an oval shape) around each local minimum $(2k\\pi, 0)$.\nThe level set is a countably infinite collection of disjoint simple closed curves.\n\nCase IV: $E = 1$\nThe equation is $y^2 = 1 + \\cos(x)$.\nSince $\\cos(x) \\ge -1$, the right-hand side $1+\\cos(x)$ is always non-negative. Real solutions for $y$ exist for all $x$.\nThe points where $y=0$ occur when $1+\\cos(x)=0$, which means $\\cos(x)=-1$. This happens at $x = (2k+1)\\pi$ for any integer $k$. These are precisely the saddle points of the potential energy function.\nAt these points, the individual closed loops from the previous case ($E<1$) have expanded and touched each other. The level set merges into a single, connected entity. This entity is a network of curves (a graph) that self-intersect at the saddle points $((2k+1)\\pi, 0)$. Each intersection looks like a figure-eight.\n\nCase V: $E > 1$\nThe equation is $y^2 = E + \\cos(x)$.\nSince $E > 1$ and $\\cos(x) \\ge -1$, the right-hand side is always strictly positive: $E+\\cos(x) \\ge E-1 > 0$.\nFor any value of $x$, there are two distinct real solutions for $y$: $y = \\sqrt{E+\\cos(x)}$ and $y = -\\sqrt{E+\\cos(x)}$.\nThis describes two separate, continuous, and unbounded wavy curves, one lying entirely in the upper half-plane ($y>0$) and the other in the lower half-plane ($y<0$). The saddle point connections from the $E=1$ case are broken.\nThe level set consists of two disjoint, unbounded curves.\n\nSummarizing the sequence of topological changes as $E$ increases:\n1.  $E < -1$: Empty set.\n2.  $E = -1$: A set of isolated points appears.\n3.  $-1 < E < 1$: Each point inflates into a closed loop. The set is a collection of disjoint closed loops.\n4.  $E = 1$: The loops merge at saddle points to form a single connected network.\n5.  $E > 1$: The network splits into two disjoint unbounded curves.\n\nThis sequence matches the description given in option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2299928"}, {"introduction": "While level sets provide a global overview of a function, calculus excels at describing local behavior.
