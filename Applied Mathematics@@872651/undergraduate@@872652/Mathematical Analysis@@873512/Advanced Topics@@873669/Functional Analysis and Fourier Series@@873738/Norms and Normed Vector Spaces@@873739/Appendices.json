It is often easier to work with the square of the distance, which we will denote by $D(a, b)$. Minimizing the distance is equivalent to minimizing its square.\n\nThe difference sequence is $v - u_{a,b}$. Its terms are:\n$(v - u_{a,b})_1 = v_1 - (u_{a,b})_1 = q - a$\n$(v - u_{a,b})_2 = v_2 - (u_{a,b})_2 = q^2 - b$\nFor $k \\ge 3$, $(v - u_{a,b})_k = v_k - (u_{a,b})_k = q^k - 0 = q^k$.\n\nThe squared distance is the sum of the squares of these terms:\n$$D(a, b) = d(v, u_{a,b})^2 = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} ((v - u_{a,b})_k)^2$$\n$$D(a, b) = (q - a)^2 + (q^2 - b)^2 + \\sum_{k=3}^{\\infty} (q^k)^2$$\n\nLet's analyze the expression for $D(a, b)$. It is composed of three parts: $(q-a)^2$, $(q^2-b)^2$, and the infinite sum $\\sum_{k=3}^{\\infty} (q^k)^2$.\nThe infinite sum does not depend on the parameters $a$ and $b$. Therefore, to minimize $D(a, b)$ with respect to $a$ and $b$, we only need to minimize the part that depends on them:\n$$f(a, b) = (q - a)^2 + (q^2 - b)^2$$\n\nThe terms $(q-a)^2$ and $(q^2-b)^2$ are squares of real numbers, so they are always non-negative. The function $f(a,b)$ is a sum of these two non-negative terms. The minimum possible value for $f(a,b)$ is 0. This minimum is achieved if and only if both terms are simultaneously zero.\n\nSetting the first term to zero:\n$$(q - a)^2 = 0 \\implies q - a = 0 \\implies a = q$$\n\nSetting the second term to zero:\n$$(q^2 - b)^2 = 0 \\implies q^2 - b = 0 \\implies b = q^2$$\n\nThus, the distance $d(v, u_{a,b})$ is minimized when $a = q$ and $b = q^2$. This represents the orthogonal projection of the vector $v$ onto the subspace spanned by the first two standard basis sequences.\n\nThe problem asks for the sum $a+b$ for the specific case where $q = 2/3$.\nSubstituting the values we found for $a$ and $b$:\n$$a+b = q + q^2$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical value $q = 2/3$:\n$$a+b = \\frac{2}{3} + \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{2}{3} + \\frac{4}{9}$$\n\nTo add these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 9.\n$$a+b = \\frac{2 \\times 3}{3 \\times 3} + \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{6}{9} + \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{10}{9}$$\n\nThe value of the sum $a+b$ that minimizes the distance is $10/9$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{10}{9}}$$", "id": "2308583"}]}
