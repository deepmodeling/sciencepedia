While each $D_h$ is bounded, the family is not uniformly bounded, as the norms $\\|D_h\\|=2/h$ are not bounded by a single constant for all $h \\in (0,1)$.\nE. \"The family $\\mathcal{F}$ is uniformly bounded with a uniform bound of $M=2$.\" This is incorrect. The family is not uniformly bounded.\n\nThe remaining options involve the Uniform Boundedness Principle (UBP), also known as the Banach-Steinhaus theorem. The UBP states that for a family of continuous linear operators $\\{T_\\alpha\\}$ from a Banach space $X$ to a normed linear space $Y$, if the family is pointwise bounded (i.e., for every $x \\in X$, the set $\\{\\|T_\\alpha(x)\\|\\}$ is bounded), then it is uniformly bounded (i.e., $\\sup_\\alpha \\|T_\\alpha\\|$ is finite).\n\nA subtlety here is that the codomain $C[0,1-h]$ depends on $h$. However, we can embed each $C[0,1-h]$ into the common Banach space $Y=C[0,1]$ by extending any function $g \\in C[0, 1-h]$ to a function $\\tilde{g} \\in C[0,1]$ (e.g., by keeping it constant on $[1-h, 1]$). The norm of the operator is not affected by this embedding. Thus, the UBP is applicable to the family of operators $\\tilde{D}_h: C[0,1] \\to C[0,1]$.\n\nThe contrapositive of the UBP is: If a family of continuous linear operators from a Banach space is not uniformly bounded, then it is not pointwise bounded. This means there must exist some element $x$ in the domain for which the set of norms of the images is unbounded.\nIn our case, $X=C[0,1]$ is a Banach space, and we have shown that the family $\\{D_h\\}$ is not uniformly bounded. Therefore, by the UBP, the family cannot be pointwise bounded. This means there exists at least one function $f \\in C[0,1]$ such that the set of real numbers $\\{\\|D_h f\\|_{\\infty,h}\\}_{h \\in (0,1)}$ is not bounded, i.e., $\\sup_{h \\in (0,1)} \\|D_h f\\|_{\\infty,h} = \\infty$.\n\nLet's re-evaluate the remaining options:\nB. \"The family $\\mathcal{F}$ is not uniformly bounded, and as a consequence, there must exist a function $f \\in C[0,1]$ for which the set of norms $\\{\\|D_h f\\|_{\\infty,h}\\}_{h \\in (0,1)}$ is unbounded.\" This statement correctly identifies that the family is not uniformly bounded and accurately states the consequence predicted by the Uniform Boundedness Principle. This is the correct option.\n\nC. \"The family $\\mathcal{F}$ is uniformly bounded because for the dense subset of continuously differentiable functions, $C^1[0,1] \\subset C[0,1]$, the set of norms $\\{\\|D_h f\\|_{\\infty,h}\\}_{h \\in (0,1)}$ is bounded for any $f \\in C^1[0,1]$.\" The premise is true: for any $f \\in C^1[0,1]$, by the Mean Value Theorem, $|(D_h f)(t)| = |f'(c)|$ for some $c \\in (t, t+h)$. Thus $\\|D_h f\\|_{\\infty,h} \\le \\|f'\\|_{\\infty}$, which is a bound independent of $h$. However, the conclusion is false. For the UBP to imply uniform boundedness, pointwise boundedness must hold for *every* function in the Banach space $C[0,1]$, not just for a dense subset. The failure of uniform boundedness implies that there must be functions outside $C^1[0,1]$ for which the difference quotients are not bounded.\n\nD. \"The family $\\mathcal{F}$ must be uniformly bounded, as the Uniform Boundedness Principle cannot be applied because the codomain $C[0, 1-h]$ changes with $h$.\" The conclusion is false (the family is not uniformly bounded), and the reasoning is flawed.
