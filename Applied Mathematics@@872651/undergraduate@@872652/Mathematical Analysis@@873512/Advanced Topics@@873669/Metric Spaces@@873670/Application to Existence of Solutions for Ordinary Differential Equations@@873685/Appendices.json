Compute the difference quotient at $y=0$:\n$$\n\\frac{|f(y)-f(0)|}{|y-0|}=\\frac{5|y|^{4/5}}{|y|}=5|y|^{-1/5}\\to \\infty \\quad \\text{as } y\\to 0.\n$$\nThus $f$ is not locally Lipschitz at $y=0$, so uniqueness need not hold.\n\nWe now construct explicit solutions.

In particular, $y(t)=t^{5}$ (i.e., $C=0$) satisfies $y(0)=0$. The constant function $y(t)\\equiv 0$ also satisfies the ODE and initial condition because $y'=0$ and $5|0|^{4/5}=0$.\n\nNonuniqueness is even stronger: we can construct infinitely many distinct solutions that are $0$ up to some time and then depart along the curve $(t-T)^{5}$.

For $tT$, $y_{T}'(t)=0=5|0|^{4/5}$; for $tT$, $y_{T}'(t)=5(t-T)^{4}=5|(t-T)^{5}|^{4/5}=5|y_{T}(t)|^{4/5}$; and at $t=T$, both sides are $0$. Thus $y_{T}$ solves the ODE and satisfies $y_{T}(0)=0$.
