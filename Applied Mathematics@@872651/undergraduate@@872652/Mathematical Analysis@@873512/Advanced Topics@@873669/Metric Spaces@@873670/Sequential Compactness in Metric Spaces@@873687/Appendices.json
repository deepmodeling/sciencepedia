Let's analyze the provided options by testing a specific case. A common strategy for disproving a universal statement (\"for any...\") is to find a single instance where it fails.\n\nLet's consider the metric space of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ with the standard metric $d(a, b) = |a-b|$.

We need to find an integer $N$ such that for any integers $m, n  N$, we have $|x_m - x_n|  \\epsilon$.\nUsing the triangle inequality, for any $m, n$, we have $|x_m - x_n| = \\left|\\frac{1}{m} - \\frac{1}{n}\\right| \\le \\left|\\frac{1}{m}\\right| + \\left|-\\frac{1}{n}\\right| = \\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{1}{n}$.\nBy the Archimedean property of real numbers, we can choose an integer $N$ such that $N  \\frac{2}{\\epsilon}$.\nIf $m  N$ and $n  N$, then $m  \\frac{2}{\\epsilon}$ and $n  \\frac{2}{\\epsilon}$, which implies $\\frac{1}{m}  \\frac{\\epsilon}{2}$ and $\\frac{1}{n}  \\frac{\\epsilon}{2}$.\nTherefore, for $m, n  N$, we have $|x_m - x_n| \\le \\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{1}{n}  \\frac{\\epsilon}{2} + \\frac{\\epsilon}{2} = \\epsilon$.\nThis confirms that $(x_n = 1/n)$ is a Cauchy sequence in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nNext, let's identify the set of points $S$.\n$S = \\{x_n \\mid n \\in \\mathbb{N}\\} = \\left\\{1, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{4}, \\dots\\right\\}$.\n\nNow, we must check if $S$ is sequentially compact. According to the definition, this would mean that *every* sequence of points from $S$ must have a subsequence that converges to a limit which is also in $S$.\n\nLet's consider one particular sequence of points from $S$: the sequence $(x_n)$ itself. The sequence $(y_k)_{k \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ defined by $y_k = x_k = 1/k$ is a sequence whose terms are all in $S$.\nIn $\\mathbb{R}$, this sequence is known to converge to a limit:\n$\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} y_k = \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{k} = 0$.\n\nIf a sequence converges to a limit $L$, then all of its subsequences also converge to the same limit $L$. So, any subsequence of $(y_k)$ must converge to $0$.\nFor the set $S$ to be sequentially compact, this limit must be an element of $S$.\nHowever, the limit is $L=0$. The set $S$ consists of numbers of the form $1/n$ where $n$ is a positive integer. All elements of $S$ are strictly positive. Thus, $0 \\notin S$.\n\nWe have found a sequence in $S$, namely $(x_n)$, which does not have a subsequence converging to a point *within* $S$ (since any convergent subsequence must converge to 0, which is not in $S$). This violates the definition of sequential compactness. Therefore, the set $S$ is not sequentially compact.\n\nSince we have found a Cauchy sequence $(x_n=1/n)$ for which the set of its points $S$ is not sequentially compact, the original assertion is false.\n\nLet's evaluate the options with this knowledge:\nA. The assertion is false, so this option is incorrect. Furthermore, its reasoning is flawed. The Heine-Borel theorem states that a set in $\\mathbb{R}^k$ is compact if and only if it is closed and bounded. This is not true for general metric spaces. Also, our counterexample set $S=\\{1/n\\}$ is bounded (by 0 and 1) but not closed, as its limit point 0 is not in $S$.\nB. The assertion is false, so this option is incorrect. Our counterexample was in $\\mathbb{R}$, which is a complete metric space, demonstrating that completeness is not a sufficient condition to make the assertion true. The reason given is also misleading; $S \\cup \\{L\\}$ being compact does not imply $S$ is compact.\nC. This option correctly states the assertion is false but provides an invalid counterexample. The sequence $x_n = (-1)^n$ is not a Cauchy sequence, since $d(x_{n+1}, x_n) = |(-1)^{n+1} - (-1)^n| = |-2(-1)^n| = 2$ for all $n$. The distance between consecutive terms does not approach zero. A non-Cauchy sequence cannot be a counterexample to a statement about Cauchy sequences.\nD. This option correctly states the assertion is false and provides the valid counterexample we analyzed above. The sequence $x_n=1/n$ is Cauchy, but the set of its points is not sequentially compact. This is the correct choice.\nE. This option correctly states the assertion is false but provides an invalid counterexample. The sequence $x_n = n$ is not a Cauchy sequence, since $d(x_{n+1}, x_n) = |(n+1) - n| = 1$ for all $n$.\n\nTherefore, the only correct evaluation is given in option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1321758"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice problem demonstrates the power of abstract topological concepts by applying them to linear algebra.
