The sequence is defined by $x_0 = 1$ and $x_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( x_n + \\frac{2}{x_n} \\right)$.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the potential convergence of the sequence. For this, we can temporarily consider the sequence as being in the space of real numbers, $\\mathbb{R}$, which contains $\\mathbb{Q}$. If the sequence converges to a limit $L$, this limit must satisfy the recurrence relation. Taking the limit as $n \\to \\infty$ on both sides of the equation:\n$$L = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} x_{n+1} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{2} \\left( x_n + \\frac{2}{x_n} \\right)$$\nAssuming the limit $L$ exists and is non-zero (which is reasonable since all terms are positive), we can write:\n$$L = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( L + \\frac{2}{L} \\right)$$\nNow, we solve this equation for $L$:\n$$2L = L + \\frac{2}{L}$$\n$$L = \\frac{2}{L}$$\n$$L^2 = 2$$\nThis implies that if the sequence converges, its limit must be $L = \\sqrt{2}$ or $L = -\\sqrt{2}$. Since $x_0 = 1$ is positive, and the operation $x_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2}(x_n + \\frac{2}{x_n})$ produces a positive number from a positive number, all terms $x_n$ are positive. Therefore, the limit, if it exists, must be positive. So, $L = \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nThe number $\\sqrt{2}$ is known to be irrational. This means that the limit of the sequence $(x_n)$ is not a member of the set of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$. Consequently, the sequence does not converge to a limit *within the space $\\mathbb{Q}$*. This directly refutes option A.\n\nNext, let's consider whether the sequence is a Cauchy sequence. A fundamental result in analysis is that any sequence that converges in a metric space is a Cauchy sequence. As we have just established, the sequence $(x_n)_{n \\ge 0}$, when viewed in the complete metric space of real numbers $(\\mathbb{R}, |\\cdot|)$, converges to $\\sqrt{2}$. Therefore, $(x_n)$ is a convergent sequence in $\\mathbb{R}$. This implies that $(x_n)$ must be a Cauchy sequence. The property of being a Cauchy sequence depends only on the terms of the sequence and the metric, which is the same for both $\\mathbb{Q}$ and $\\mathbb{R}$ for these elements. Thus, $(x_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence in $(\\mathbb{Q}, d)$. This refutes option B.\n\nNow, let's consider if the sequence is unbounded. A convergent sequence in any metric space is always bounded. Since our sequence converges in $\\mathbb{R}$, it must be bounded. The terms are all positive. We can also show, for instance, that for $n \\ge 1$, the terms are bounded above by $x_1 = 1.5$. More formally, for any $x  0$, the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality states that $\\frac{1}{2}(x + \\frac{2}{x}) \\ge \\sqrt{x \\cdot \\frac{2}{x}} = \\sqrt{2}$. So, for all $n \\ge 0$, $x_{n+1} \\ge \\sqrt{2}$. This shows the sequence is bounded below. One can also show that for $n \\ge 1$, the sequence is monotonically decreasing. Since the sequence converges, it is bounded. This refutes option D.\n\nFinally, we combine our findings. We have shown:\n1.  The sequence is a Cauchy sequence.\n2.  The sequence does not converge to a limit within the space $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThis matches the description in option C precisely. The existence of such a sequence (a Cauchy sequence in $\\mathbb{Q}$ that does not converge to a point in $\\mathbb{Q}$) is the classic demonstration that the metric space $(\\mathbb{Q}, d)$ is not complete.\n\nThus, the correct statement is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1293483"}, {"introduction": "A common misconception is that if the distance between successive terms of a sequence approaches zero, the sequence must converge.
