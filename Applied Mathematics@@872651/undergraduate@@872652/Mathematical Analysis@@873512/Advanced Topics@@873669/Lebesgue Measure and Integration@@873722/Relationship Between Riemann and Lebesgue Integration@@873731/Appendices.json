Let's compute these for our function $f$ on $[0,1]$.\n\nLet $P = \\{x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_n\\}$ be an arbitrary partition of the interval $[0,1]$, such that $0 = x_0  x_1  \\dots  x_n = 1$. For each subinterval $[x_{i-1}, x_i]$, we need to find the infimum and supremum of $f(x)$.\n\nThe set of numbers with a finite binary expansion is the set of dyadic rationals, which is dense in $[0,1]$. This means that every non-empty open interval $(a, b) \\subset [0,1]$ contains at least one number with a finite binary expansion.\nSimilarly, the set of irrational numbers (which all have infinite, non-repeating binary expansions) is also dense in $[0,1]$. Thus, every subinterval $[x_{i-1}, x_i]$ contains numbers whose binary expansions are not finite.\n\nLet $m_i = \\inf_{x \\in [x_{i-1}, x_i]} f(x)$ and $M_i = \\sup_{x \\in [x_{i-1}, x_i]} f(x)$.\nSince every subinterval $[x_{i-1}, x_i]$ contains at least one number without a finite binary expansion, there exists an $x$ in this subinterval such that $f(x) = 0$. Therefore, $m_i = 0$ for all $i=1, \\dots, n$.\nSince every subinterval $[x_{i-1}, x_i]$ contains at least one number with a finite binary expansion, there exists a $y$ in this subinterval such that $f(y) = 1$. Therefore, $M_i = 1$ for all $i=1, \\dots, n$.\n\nThe lower Riemann sum for the partition $P$ is given by:\n$$L(f, P) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} m_i (x_i - x_{i-1}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} 0 \\cdot (x_i - x_{i-1}) = 0$$\nThe upper Riemann sum for the partition $P$ is given by:\n$$U(f, P) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} M_i (x_i - x_{i-1}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} 1 \\cdot (x_i - x_{i-1}) = x_n - x_0 = 1 - 0 = 1$$\n\nSince these results hold for any arbitrary partition $P$, the lower Riemann integral is the supremum of all lower sums, and the upper Riemann integral is the infimum of all upper sums.\n$$\n\\underline{\\int_0^1} f(x) \\, dx = \\sup_{P} L(f, P) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\overline{\\int_0^1} f(x) \\, dx = \\inf_{P} U(f, P) = 1\n$$\nBecause the lower and upper Riemann integrals are not equal ($0 \\neq 1$), the function $f$ is not Riemann integrable on $[0,1]$. This eliminates options C and D.\n\n**Part 2: Lebesgue Integrability**\n\nIn Lebesgue integration, the value of the integral is determined by the function's behavior \"almost everywhere\". Let $S$ be the set of points where $f(x)$ is non-zero.\n$$S = \\{x \\in [0,1] \\mid x \\text{ has a finite binary expansion}\\}$$\nA number has a finite binary expansion if and only if it is a dyadic rational, i.e., a number of the form $\\frac{m}{2^k}$ for non-negative integers $m$ and $k$. The set $S$ can be written as a union of sets:\n$$S = \\bigcup_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\left\\{ \\frac{m}{2^k} \\mid m \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 2^k\\} \\right\\}$$\nEach set in the union is finite. The set $S$ is a countable union of finite sets, which makes $S$ itself a countable set.\n\nIn Lebesgue measure theory, any countable set has a Lebesgue measure of zero. Therefore, the measure of $S$ is $\\mu(S) = 0$.\n\nThe function $f(x)$ is $0$ for all $x \\in [0,1] \\setminus S$. Since $\\mu(S) = 0$, we say that $f(x) = 0$ almost everywhere (a.e.) on $[0,1]$.\nThe function $f$ is a measurable function (it is the characteristic function of the set $S$, which is measurable). Also, $f$ is bounded on $[0,1]$ (since $|f(x)| \\le 1$). Any bounded measurable function on a set of finite measure is Lebesgue integrable. Thus, $f$ is Lebesgue integrable on $[0,1]$.\n\nThe value of the Lebesgue integral is given by:\n$$I_{\\mathcal{L}} = \\int_{[0,1]} f \\, d\\mu = \\int_{S} f \\, d\\mu + \\int_{[0,1]\\setminus S} f \\, d\\mu$$\nOn the set $S$, $f(x) = 1$.
