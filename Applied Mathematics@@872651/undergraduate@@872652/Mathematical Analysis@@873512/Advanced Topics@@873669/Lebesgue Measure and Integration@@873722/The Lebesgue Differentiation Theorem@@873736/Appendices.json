This first practice provides a concrete example of this principle.

This function is continuous everywhere. A continuous function is always locally integrable. Furthermore, for a function that is continuous at a point $x_0$, the conclusion of the Lebesgue Differentiation Theorem holds exactly at that point (not just \"almost everywhere\").\n\nSince $f(x, y) = x$ is continuous for all points in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, we can directly apply the theorem for any point $P = (a, b)$. The limit of the average value of $f$ over disks centered at $P$ as the radius shrinks to zero will be the value of the function $f$ evaluated at $P$.\n\nTherefore,\n$$\nL = f(P) = f(a, b) = a.\n$$\nThis method is very direct and relies on understanding the conceptual meaning of the Lebesgue Differentiation Theorem.\n\n**Method 2: Direct Calculation**\n\nWe can also compute the limit by explicitly evaluating the integral. The area of the disk $D_r(P)$ is $\\pi r^2$. The integral we need to compute is $\\iint_{D_r(P)} x \\, dA$.\n\nThe disk $D_r(P)$ is defined by the inequality $(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 \\le r^2$. To evaluate the integral, it is convenient to switch to polar coordinates centered at the point $P=(a, b)$. We use the transformation:\n$$\nx = a + \\rho \\cos\\theta\n$$\n$$\ny = b + \\rho \\sin\\theta\n$$\nThe domain of integration in these new coordinates is $0 \\le \\rho \\le r$ and $0 \\le \\theta \\le 2\\pi$. The area element in these shifted polar coordinates is $dA = \\rho \\, d\\rho \\, d\\theta$.\n\nNow, we set up the integral for the numerator:\n$$\n\\iint_{D_r(P)} x \\, dA = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^r (a + \\rho \\cos\\theta) (\\rho \\, d\\rho \\, d\\theta)\n$$\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n$$\n= \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^r a\\rho \\, d\\rho \\, d\\theta + \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^r \\rho^2 \\cos\\theta \\, d\\rho \\, d\\theta\n$$\nFirst, evaluate the integral with respect to $\\rho$:\n$$\n\\int_0^r a\\rho \\, d\\rho = \\left[ \\frac{a\\rho^2}{2} \\right]_0^r = \\frac{ar^2}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\int_0^r \\rho^2 \\cos\\theta \\, d\\rho = \\cos\\theta \\left[ \\frac{\\rho^3}{3} \\right]_0^r = \\frac{r^3}{3}\\cos\\theta\n$$\nNow, substitute these back and integrate with respect to $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\iint_{D_r(P)} x \\, dA = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{ar^2}{2} \\, d\\theta + \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\frac{r^3}{3}\\cos\\theta \\, d\\theta\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{ar^2}{2} [\\theta]_0^{2\\pi} + \\frac{r^3}{3} [\\sin\\theta]_0^{2\\pi}\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{ar^2}{2} (2\\pi - 0) + \\frac{r^3}{3} (\\sin(2\\pi) - \\sin(0))\n$$\n$$\n= a \\pi r^2 + \\frac{r^3}{3} (0 - 0) = a \\pi r^2\n$$\nNow we can compute the average value $\\langle f \\rangle_{D_r(P)}$:\n$$\n\\langle f \\rangle_{D_r(P)} = \\frac{1}{\\text{Area}(D_r(P))} \\iint_{D_r(P)} x \\, dA = \\frac{a \\pi r^2}{\\pi r^2} = a\n$$\nInterestingly, the average value of $f(x, y) = x$ over any disk centered at $(a, b)$ is constant and equal to $a$, regardless of the radius $r > 0$.\n\nFinally, we take the limit as $r \\to 0^+$:\n$$\nL = \\lim_{r \\to 0^+} \\langle f \\rangle_{D_r(P)} = \\lim_{r \\to 0^+} a = a\n$$\nBoth methods yield the same result.
