We consider two cases for the sign of $x$.\n\n**Case 1: $x \\in (0, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$**\nIn this case, the integral is evaluated from $t=0$ to $t=x$. For any $t$ within the domain of integration, we have $0  t  x$. Since $x  \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, we have $0  t  \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\nLet's analyze the sign of the integrand, $(-\\sin(t))(x-t)^4$:\n- For $t \\in (0, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$, the value of $\\sin(t)$ is positive. Therefore, $-\\sin(t)$ is negative.\n- For $t \\in (0, x)$, we have $x-t  0$. Thus, its fourth power, $(x-t)^4$, is positive.\nThe integrand is a product of a strictly negative term ($-\\sin(t)$) and a strictly positive term ($(x-t)^4$) for $t \\in (0, x)$. Thus, the integrand is strictly negative.\nThe definite integral of a strictly negative continuous function over an interval $[0, x]$ with $x0$ is negative.\nThe factor $\\frac{1}{24}$ is positive. Therefore, $R_4(x)$ is negative for $x \\in (0, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$.\n\n**Case 2: $x \\in (-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, 0)$**\nIn this case, the upper limit of integration, $x$, is less than the lower limit, $0$. This can be tricky, so a change of variables is helpful.\nLet $t = ux$. Since $x$ is a constant with respect to the integration, $dt = x\\,du$.\nThe limits of integration for $u$ become:\n- When $t=0$, $0 = ux \\implies u=0$ (since $x \\neq 0$).\n- When $t=x$, $x = ux \\implies u=1$.\nSubstituting into the expression for $R_4(x)$:\n$$R_4(x) = \\frac{1}{24} \\int_0^1 (-\\sin(ux)) (x-ux)^4 (x\\,du)$$\n$$R_4(x) = \\frac{1}{24} \\int_0^1 (-\\sin(ux)) x^4(1-u)^4 (x\\,du)$$\n$$R_4(x) = \\frac{x^5}{24} \\int_0^1 (-\\sin(ux)) (1-u)^4 du$$\nNow, let's analyze the sign of this expression for $x \\in (-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, 0)$.\n- The term $x^5$ is negative since $x$ is negative.\n- The integral is $\\int_0^1 (-\\sin(ux)) (1-u)^4 du$. The integration variable $u$ is in the interval $(0, 1)$.\n- For $u \\in (0, 1)$, the term $(1-u)^4$ is positive.\n- The argument of the sine function is $ux$. Since $x \\in (-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, 0)$ and $u \\in (0, 1)$, their product $ux$ must be in the interval $(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, 0)$.\n- For any angle $\\theta$ in the interval $(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, 0)$, we know that $\\sin(\\theta)$ is negative. Therefore, $\\sin(ux)  0$.\n- This means the term $-\\sin(ux)$ is positive.\n- The integrand, $(-\\sin(ux))(1-u)^4$, is the product of two positive terms, so it is strictly positive for $u \\in (0,1)$.\n- The definite integral of a strictly positive function over the interval $[0,1]$ is a positive value.\n- So, $R_4(x)$ is the product of a negative term ($\\frac{x^5}{24}$) and a positive term (the integral).\n$$R_4(x) = (\\text{negative}) \\times (\\text{positive}) = \\text{negative}$$\nTherefore, $R_4(x)$ is also negative for $x \\in (-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, 0)$.\n\n**Conclusion**\nWe have shown that $R_4(x)  0$ for all non-zero $x$ in the interval $(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$.\nSince $R_4(x) = \\cos(x) - P_4(x)  0$, it follows that $\\cos(x)  P_4(x)$ for all $x \\in (-\\frac{\\pi}{2}, 0) \\cup (0, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$.\nThis means that the polynomial $P_4(x)$ is always an overestimate of $\\cos(x)$ for all non-zero $x$ in the specified interval.\nThis corresponds to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2324279"}, {"introduction": "In many practical applications, we need a guarantee that the error of our approximation will not exceed a certain threshold over an entire interval.
