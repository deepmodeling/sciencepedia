This expression is of the form $f(b) - f(a)$. This structure suggests using the Mean Value Theorem (MVT).\n\nLet's define the function $f(x) = \\sqrt[3]{x} = x^{1/3}$. The expression $E$ can then be written as $f(28) - f(27)$. We will apply the MVT to the function $f(x)$ on the interval $[27, 28]$.\n\nFirst, we must verify that the conditions for the MVT are met for $f(x)$ on $[27, 28]$.\n1.  **Continuity:** The function $f(x) = x^{1/3}$ is continuous for all real numbers, so it is continuous on the closed interval $[27, 28]$.\n2.  **Differentiability:** The derivative of $f(x)$ is $f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(x^{1/3}) = \\frac{1}{3}x^{-2/3} = \\frac{1}{3x^{2/3}}$. This derivative is defined for all $x \\neq 0$. Since the interval $(27, 28)$ does not contain $0$, the function $f(x)$ is differentiable on the open interval $(27, 28)$.\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied, the MVT guarantees that there exists at least one number $c$ such that $c \\in (27, 28)$ and\n$$f'(c) = \\frac{f(28) - f(27)}{28 - 27}$$\nSubstituting the function and the interval endpoints, we get:\n$$\\frac{1}{3c^{2/3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt[3]{28} - \\sqrt[3]{27}}{1}$$\nWe know that $\\sqrt[3]{27} = 3$, so the expression simplifies to:\n$$\\sqrt[3]{28} - 3 = \\frac{1}{3c^{2/3}}$$\nThe original expression $E$ is therefore equal to $\\frac{1}{3c^{2/3}}$ for some $c \\in (27, 28)$.\n\nTo find a strict upper bound for $E$, we need to find a strict upper bound for the term $\\frac{1}{3c^{2/3}}$ given the constraint $27  c  28$.\n\nLet's analyze the behavior of the expression $\\frac{1}{3x^{2/3}}$ for $x  0$. The function $g(x) = x^{2/3}$ is an increasing function for $x  0$. Consequently, its reciprocal, $h(x) = \\frac{1}{x^{2/3}}$, is a decreasing function for $x  0$. Similarly, $\\frac{1}{3x^{2/3}}$ is also a decreasing function for $x  0$.\n\nSince we have $27  c  28$, and the function $f'(x) = \\frac{1}{3x^{2/3}}$ is decreasing, the value of $f'(c)$ will be strictly less than its value at the left endpoint of the interval, $x=27$.\n$$c  27$$\n$$c^{2/3}  27^{2/3}$$\nThe value of $27^{2/3}$ is $(\\sqrt[3]{27})^2 = 3^2 = 9$.\nSo, we have:\n$$c^{2/3}  9$$\nTaking the reciprocal of both sides reverses the inequality sign:\n$$\\frac{1}{c^{2/3}}  \\frac{1}{9}$$\nMultiplying by $\\frac{1}{3}$ (a positive constant) preserves the inequality:\n$$\\frac{1}{3c^{2/3}}  \\frac{1}{3 \\cdot 9}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{3c^{2/3}}  \\frac{1}{27}$$\nSince $E = \\sqrt[3]{28} - 3 = \\frac{1}{3c^{2/3}}$, we can conclude that:\n$$E  \\frac{1}{27}$$\nThus, $\\frac{1}{27}$ is a strict rational upper bound for the expression.

Therefore, the equation has exactly two distinct real roots in total, both positive.
