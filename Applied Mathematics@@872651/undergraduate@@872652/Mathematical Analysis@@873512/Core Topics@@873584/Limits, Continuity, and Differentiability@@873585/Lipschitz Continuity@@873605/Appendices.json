The domain $[0, 1]$ is a closed and bounded interval, which means it is a compact set in $\\mathbb{R}$.\nThe Heine-Cantor theorem states that any continuous function defined on a compact set is uniformly continuous on that set.\nSince $f(x) = \\sqrt{x}$ is continuous on the compact set $[0, 1]$, it must be uniformly continuous on $[0, 1]$.\nTherefore, statement A is true.\n\n**Analysis of Statement B: Lipschitz Continuity on [0, 1]**\nStatement B claims that $f(x) = \\sqrt{x}$ is Lipschitz continuous on $[0, 1]$.\nFor $f(x)$ to be Lipschitz continuous on $[0, 1]$, there must exist a constant $L \\ge 0$ such that for all $x, y \\in [0, 1]$, $|f(x) - f(y)| \\le L|x-y|$.\nThis inequality can be rewritten as $\\frac{|f(x) - f(y)|}{|x-y|} \\le L$ for all $x \\neq y$ in $[0, 1]$.

We examine the limit of $f'(x)$ as $x$ approaches the endpoints of the interval. As $x \\to 1^-$, $f'(x) \\to \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{1}} = \\frac{1}{2}$.

To maximize the integral, we should aim to make the integrand $f(x)$ as large as possible for each $x \\in [0, 1]$, subject to the given constraints.\n\nLet $f$ be an arbitrary function in the set $\\mathcal{F}$. The constraints on $f$ are:\n1. $|f(x) - f(y)| \\le L|x - y|$ for all $x, y \\in [0, 1]$.\n2. $f(0) = a$ and $f(1) = b$.\n\nFrom the Lipschitz condition, we can derive pointwise upper bounds on $f(x)$.\nFirst, let's use the boundary condition at $x=0$. For any $x \\in [0, 1]$:\n$|f(x) - f(0)| \\le L|x - 0| \\implies |f(x) - a| \\le Lx$.\nThis implies $f(x) - a \\le Lx$, which gives the upper bound:\n$f(x) \\le a + Lx$.\n\nNext, let's use the boundary condition at $x=1$. For any $x \\in [0, 1]$:\n$|f(x) - f(1)| \\le L|x - 1|$. Since $x \\in [0, 1]$, $|x-1| = 1-x$.\nSo, $|f(x) - b| \\le L(1 - x)$.\nThis implies $f(x) - b \\le L(1 - x)$, which gives the upper bound:\n$f(x) \\le b + L(1 - x)$.\n\nSince $f(x)$ must satisfy both inequalities for every $x \\in [0,1]$, it must be less than or equal to the minimum of the two upper bounds:\n$f(x) \\le \\min\\left(a + Lx, b + L(1-x)\\right)$.\n\nThis inequality holds for any function $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$. This suggests that the function which maximizes the integral might be the one that actually attains this upper bound. Let's define this candidate function as $f_{max}(x)$:\n$$f_{max}(x) = \\min\\left(a + Lx, b + L(1 - x)\\right)$$\nIf we can show that $f_{max}(x)$ is itself an element of $\\mathcal{F}$, then for any other $f \\in \\mathcal{F}$, we would have $f(x) \\le f_{max}(x)$ for all $x \\in [0,1]$. This would imply $\\int_0^1 f(x) \\, dx \\le \\int_0^1 f_{max}(x) \\, dx$, establishing that the integral of $f_{max}(x)$ is the maximum value.\n\nSo, we verify if $f_{max} \\in \\mathcal{F}$.\nFirst, let's check the boundary conditions.\nAt $x=0$: $f_{max}(0) = \\min(a, b+L)$. The given condition $L  |b-a|$ implies $L  b-a$ and $L  a-b$. From $L  b-a$, we get $a  b+L$. Thus, $f_{max}(0) = a$.\nAt $x=1$: $f_{max}(1) = \\min(a+L, b)$. From $L  a-b$, we get $b  a+L$. Thus, $f_{max}(1) = b$.\nThe boundary conditions are satisfied.\n\nSecond, let's check if $f_{max}(x)$ is Lipschitz continuous with constant $L$.\nLet $g_1(x) = a+Lx$ and $g_2(x) = b+L(1-x)$. Both $g_1$ and $g_2$ are Lipschitz continuous with constant $L$, as $|g_1(x)-g_1(y)| = L|x-y|$ and $|g_2(x)-g_2(y)| = L|x-y|$.\nThe function $f_{max}(x) = \\min(g_1(x), g_2(x))$ is the minimum of two Lipschitz continuous functions.\nFor any four real numbers $u, v, w, z$, the inequality $|\\min(u,v) - \\min(w,z)| \\le \\max(|u-w|, |v-z|)$ holds.\nLet $x, y \\in [0, 1]$. Then\n$|f_{max}(x) - f_{max}(y)| = |\\min(g_1(x), g_2(x)) - \\min(g_1(y), g_2(y))|$\n$\\le \\max(|g_1(x)-g_1(y)|, |g_2(x)-g_2(y)|)$\n$\\le \\max(L|x-y|, L|x-y|) = L|x-y|$.\nThus, $f_{max}(x)$ is Lipschitz continuous with constant $L$.\n\nSince $f_{max}(x)$ satisfies all conditions for being in $\\mathcal{F}$, it is the function that provides the maximum value for the integral. Now we must calculate $I[f_{max}] = \\int_0^1 f_{max}(x) \\, dx$.\n\nThe function $f_{max}(x)$ is piecewise linear. The two lines $y=a+Lx$ and $y=b+L(1-x)$ intersect at a point $x_0$ where:\n$a + Lx_0 = b + L(1 - x_0) = b + L - Lx_0$\n$2Lx_0 = b - a + L$\n$x_0 = \\frac{L + b - a}{2L} = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{b-a}{2L}$.\nThe condition $L  |b-a|$ is equivalent to $-L  b-a  L$, which implies $-1  \\frac{b-a}{L}  1$. Dividing by 2 and adding 1/2 gives $0  x_0  1$.\nSo, the function is:\n$$f_{max}(x) = \\begin{cases} a+Lx  \\text{if } 0 \\le x \\le x_0 \\\\ b+L(1-x)  \\text{if } x_0 \\le x \\le 1 \\end{cases}$$\nThe integral is the area under this \"tent-shaped\" curve. We can calculate it by splitting the integral at $x_0$:\n$I_{max} = \\int_0^1 f_{max}(x) \\, dx = \\int_0^{x_0} (a+Lx) \\, dx + \\int_{x_0}^1 (b+L(1-x)) \\, dx$.\nAn alternative geometric approach simplifies the calculation. The total area can be seen as the area of the rectangle $[0,1] \\times [0,b]$ plus the area of two triangles. A more direct way is to use the area of a trapezoid formula which for an integral is the length of the interval times the average value.
