We are given $\\varepsilon = 1$. Our goal is to find the suitable range for $x$ from the $\\varepsilon$-inequality and then determine the largest $\\delta$ that keeps $x$ within that range.\n\nFirst, we analyze the inequality involving $\\varepsilon$:\n$$|\\sqrt{x} - 2|  \\varepsilon$$\nSubstituting $\\varepsilon = 1$, we get:\n$$|\\sqrt{x} - 2|  1$$\n\nThis absolute value inequality can be rewritten as a compound inequality:\n$$-1  \\sqrt{x} - 2  1$$\n\nTo isolate $\\sqrt{x}$, we add 2 to all parts of the inequality:\n$$2 - 1  \\sqrt{x}  2 + 1$$\n$$1  \\sqrt{x}  3$$\n\nSince all parts of this inequality are positive, we can square all parts without changing the direction of the inequalities. This will allow us to find the corresponding interval for $x$:\n$$1^2  (\\sqrt{x})^2  3^2$$\n$$1  x  9$$\n\nSo, the condition $|\\sqrt{x} - 2|  1$ is equivalent to the condition that $x$ must lie in the interval $(1, 9)$.\n\nNow, we need to find the largest $\\delta > 0$ such that the interval defined by $0  |x-4|  \\delta$ is entirely contained within the interval $(1, 9)$. The inequality $|x - 4|  \\delta$ can be expanded as:\n$$-\\delta  x - 4  \\delta$$\n\nAdding 4 to all parts, we get the interval for $x$ in terms of $\\delta$:\n$$4 - \\delta  x  4 + \\delta$$\n\nWe must ensure that the interval $(4 - \\delta, 4 + \\delta)$ is a subset of the interval $(1, 9)$. This requires satisfying two conditions:\n1. The lower bound of the $\\delta$-interval must be greater than or equal to the lower bound of the target interval:\n$$4 - \\delta \\ge 1$$\n$$3 \\ge \\delta$$\n$$\\delta \\le 3$$\n\n2.

To satisfy both, $\\delta$ must be less than or equal to the smaller of the two bounds, which is 3.\n$$\\delta \\le \\min(3, 5) = 3$$\n\nTherefore, the largest possible value for $\\delta$ is 3. For any $x$ such that $0  |x-4|  3$, we have $1  x  7$. The interval $(1, 7)$ is a subset of $(1, 9)$, so the condition $|\\sqrt{x}-2|1$ is satisfied. If we chose a $\\delta > 3$, for instance $\\delta = 4$, the interval for $x$ would be $(0, 8)$.
