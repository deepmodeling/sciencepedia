[@problem_id:20043]", "problem": "**Problem Statement**\n\nIn the study of real analysis, the Extreme Value Theorem is a fundamental result. It states that if a real-valued function $f$ is continuous on a closed and bounded interval $[a, b]$, then $f$ must attain its absolute maximum and absolute minimum value at least once on that interval. These extreme values occur either at the endpoints of the interval ($x=a$ or $x=b$) or at critical points within the interval $(a, b)$. A critical point is a point $c$ in the domain of $f$ where the derivative $f'(c)$ is either zero or does not exist.\n\nConsider the function $f(x)$ defined as:\n$$\nf(x) = |9 - x^2|\n$$\nThis function is continuous over the entire real line. Your task is to determine the absolute maximum value of this function on the closed interval $[-4, 4]$.", "solution": "**Derivation**\n\nThe problem asks for the absolute maximum value of the function $f(x) = |9 - x^2|$ on the closed interval $[-4, 4]$. According to the Extreme Value Theorem, we must evaluate the function at the endpoints of the interval and at any critical points within the interval. The largest of these values will be the absolute maximum.\n\n**Step 1: Define the function in a piecewise manner.**\n\nThe absolute value function $|y|$ is defined as $y$ if $y \\ge 0$ and $-y$ if $y  0$. We apply this to $g(x) = 9 - x^2$.\nThe expression $9 - x^2$ is non-negative when $9 - x^2 \\ge 0$, which simplifies to $x^2 \\le 9$, or $-3 \\le x \\le 3$.\nThe expression $9 - x^2$ is negative when $x^2  9$, which means $x  -3$ or $x  3$.\n\nThus, we can write $f(x)$ as a piecewise function on the interval $[-4, 4]$:\n$$\nf(x) = \\begin{cases} x^2 - 9  \\text{if } x \\in [-4, -3) \\cup (3, 4] \\\\ 9 - x^2  \\text{if } x \\in [-3, 3] \\end{cases}\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Find the critical points by finding the derivative.**\n\nWe compute the derivative, $f'(x)$, for each piece:\n$$\nf'(x) = \\begin{cases} 2x  \\text{if } x \\in (-4, -3) \\cup (3, 4) \\\\ -2x  \\text{if } x \\in (-3, 3) \\end{cases}\n$$\n\nNow, we find the critical points.\n1.  **Points where $f'(x) = 0$**:\n    - In the interval $(-3, 3)$, we set $-2x = 0$, which gives $x = 0$. This is a valid critical point as it lies within this interval.\n    - In the intervals $(-4, -3) \\cup (3, 4)$, we set $2x = 0$, which also gives $x=0$. However, $x=0$ is not in the domain of this piece, so it does not yield a critical point from this case.\n    - The only critical point from $f'(x)=0$ is $x=0$.\n\n2.  **Points where $f'(x)$ is undefined**:\n    The derivative is potentially undefined at the points where the definition of the function changes, namely $x=-3$ and $x=3$. We check the one-sided limits of the derivative at these points.\n    - At $x=3$:\n      $\\lim_{x \\to 3^-} f'(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 3^-} (-2x) = -6$\n      $\\lim_{x \\to 3^+} f'(x) = \\lim_{x \\to 3^+} (2x) = 6$\n      Since the left-hand and right-hand limits are not equal, the derivative $f'(3)$ does not exist. So, $x=3$ is a critical point.\n    - At $x=-3$:\n      $\\lim_{x \\to -3^-} f'(x) = \\lim_{x \\to -3^-} (2x) = -6$\n      $\\lim_{x \\to -3^+} f'(x) = \\lim_{x \\to -3^+} (-2x) = 6$\n      Since the limits are not equal, $f'(-3)$ does not exist. So, $x=-3$ is a critical point.\n\n**Step 3: Identify all candidate points.**\n\nThe candidates for the location of the absolute maximum are the critical points and the endpoints of the interval.\n- Critical points: $x = -3$, $x = 0$, $x = 3$.\n- Endpoints of the interval $[-4, 4]$: $x = -4$, $x = 4$.\n\n**Step 4: Evaluate the function at the candidate points.**\n\nWe now compute the value of $f(x)$ at each of these candidate points.\n- $f(-4) = |9 - (-4)^2| = |9 - 16| = |-7| = 7$\n- $f(-3) = |9 - (-3)^2| = |9 - 9| = |0| = 0$\n- $f(0) = |9 - 0^2| = |9| = 9$\n- $f(3) = |9 - 3^2| = |9 - 9| = |0| = 0$\n- $f(4) = |9 - 4^2| = |9 - 16| = |-7| = 7$\n\n**Step 5: Determine the absolute maximum value.**\n\nWe compare the values we calculated: $\\{7, 0, 9, 0, 7\\}$.\nThe largest value in this set is $9$.\n\nTherefore, the absolute maximum value of the function $f(x) = |9 - x^2|$ on the interval $[-4, 4]$ is $9$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{9}$$", "id": "20043"}, {"introduction": "The power of the Extreme Value Theorem lies in its guarantee, but this guarantee only holds if its conditions—a continuous function on a closed and bounded interval—are met.

Therefore, it is continuous on the closed and bounded interval $[0, 1]$. By the Extreme Value Theorem, $f(x)$ is guaranteed to attain a global minimum and a global maximum on this interval. Let's denote the minimum value as $f_{min}$ and the maximum value as $f_{max}$. These occur at points $x_m$ and $x_M$ in $[0, 1]$, respectively. So, for any $x \\in [0, 1]$, we have the inequality:\n$$f(x_m) \\le f(x) \\le f(x_M)$$\n\nNext, consider the function $g(x) = \\exp(-f(x))$. This function is a composition of two functions. Let $h(u) = \\exp(-u)$. Then $g(x) = h(f(x))$.\nThe function $f(x)$ is continuous on $[0, 1]$. The function $h(u) = \\exp(-u)$ is continuous for all real numbers $u$. The composition of two continuous functions is also continuous. Therefore, $g(x)$ is a continuous function on the closed and bounded interval $[0, 1]$. By the Extreme Value Theorem, $g(x)$ is also guaranteed to achieve a global minimum and a global maximum on $[0, 1]$. This immediately shows that option D is incorrect.\n\nTo find the relationship between the locations of the extrema, we must analyze the properties of the outer function, $h(u) = \\exp(-u)$. Let's examine its derivative:\n$$h'(u) = \\frac{d}{du}(\\exp(-u)) = -\\exp(-u)$$\nSince $\\exp(-u)$ is always positive for any real number $u$, its negative, $-\\exp(-u)$, is always negative. A function with a strictly negative derivative is a strictly decreasing function. This means that if $u_1  u_2$, then $h(u_1)  h(u_2)$.\n\nWe established that for any $x \\in [0, 1]$, $f(x_m) \\le f(x) \\le f(x_M)$.\nNow, we apply the strictly decreasing function $h(u) = \\exp(-u)$ to this chain of inequalities. When a strictly decreasing function is applied, the inequalities are reversed.\n$$h(f(x_m)) \\ge h(f(x)) \\ge h(f(x_M))$$\nSubstituting the definitions of $g(x)$ and $h(u)$:\n$$\\exp(-f(x_m)) \\ge \\exp(-f(x)) \\ge \\exp(-f(x_M))$$\nThis is equivalent to:\n$$g(x_m) \\ge g(x) \\ge g(x_M)$$\n\nThis final inequality tells us two things:\n1.  The maximum value of $g(x)$ is $g(x_m)$, which occurs at the point $x_m$ where $f(x)$ achieved its minimum. So, the location of the maximum of $g(x)$ is $x'_M = x_m$.\n2.  The minimum value of $g(x)$ is $g(x_M)$, which occurs at the point $x_M$ where $f(x)$ achieved its maximum.
