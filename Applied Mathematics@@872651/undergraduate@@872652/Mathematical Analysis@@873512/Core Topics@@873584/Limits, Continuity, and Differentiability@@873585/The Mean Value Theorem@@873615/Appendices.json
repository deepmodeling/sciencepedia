Therefore, as a composition of continuous functions, $f$ is continuous on $[-1,1]$.\n\nSecond, differentiability on $(-1,1)$: for $x \\neq 0$, use the power rule to obtain\n$$\nf'(x)=\\frac{2}{3}x^{-1/3}.\n$$\nAt $x=0$, compute the derivative via the limit of the difference quotient:\n$$\n\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{f(h)-f(0)}{h}=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{|h|^{2/3}}{h}\n=\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\left(|h|^{-1/3}\\right)\\operatorname{sgn}(h).\n$$\nThe magnitude $|h|^{-1/3}$ tends to $+\\infty$ as $h \\to 0$, so the limit does not exist as a finite real number.
