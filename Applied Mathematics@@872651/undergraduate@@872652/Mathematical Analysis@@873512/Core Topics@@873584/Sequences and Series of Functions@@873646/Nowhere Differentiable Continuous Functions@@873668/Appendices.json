We will analyze each option.\n\nLet $x_0$ be an arbitrary point in $\\mathbb{R}$. We are given that the derivative of $W(x)$, denoted $W'(x_0)$, does not exist for any $x_0$.\n\n**A. $g_1(x) = |W(x)|$**\n\nThe differentiability of the absolute value of a function $f(x)$ at a point $x_0$ depends on the value of $f(x_0)$.\nCase 1: $W(x_0) \\neq 0$. In a small neighborhood of $x_0$, $W(x)$ is either strictly positive or strictly negative because it is continuous. Thus, in this neighborhood, either $|W(x)| = W(x)$ or $|W(x)| = -W(x)$. In either case, the differentiability of $|W(x)|$ at $x_0$ is equivalent to the differentiability of $W(x)$ at $x_0$. Since $W(x)$ is nowhere differentiable, $g_1(x)$ is not differentiable at any $x_0$ where $W(x_0) \\neq 0$.\nCase 2: $W(x_0) = 0$. The derivative of $g_1(x)$ at $x_0$ is given by the limit:\n$$ g_1'(x_0) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{g_1(x_0+h) - g_1(x_0)}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{|W(x_0+h)| - 0}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{|W(x_0+h)|}{h} $$\nFor this limit to exist, the right-hand and left-hand limits must exist and be equal.\nThe right-hand limit is $L_+ = \\lim_{h \\to 0^+} \\frac{|W(x_0+h)|}{h}$.\nThe left-hand limit is $L_- = \\lim_{h \\to 0^-} \\frac{|W(x_0+h)|}{h} = \\lim_{k \\to 0^+} \\frac{|W(x_0-k)|}{-k}$ (letting $h = -k$).\nThe non-differentiability of $W(x)$ at $x_0$ means that $\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{W(x_0+h)-W(x_0)}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{W(x_0+h)}{h}$ does not exist. The function $W(x)$ oscillates infinitely rapidly near any point, meaning it must take on both positive and negative values in any neighborhood of a zero. This creates a \"cusp\" or \"corner\" in the graph of $|W(x)|$ at $x_0$, so the derivative does not exist. More formally, the violent oscillations of the fraction $\\frac{W(x_0+h)}{h}$ prevent the limit of its absolute value, $\\frac{|W(x_0+h)|}{|h|}$, from existing. Thus, $g_1(x)$ is also nowhere differentiable.\n\n**B. $g_2(x) = W(x)^2$**\n\nWe can attempt to use the chain rule. If $W(x)$ were differentiable, the derivative would be $g_2'(x) = 2W(x)W'(x)$.\nAt any point $x_0$ where $W(x_0) \\neq 0$, the existence of $g_2'(x_0)$ would imply the existence of $W'(x_0) = \\frac{g_2'(x_0)}{2W(x_0)}$, which is a contradiction. So $g_2(x)$ is not differentiable at points where $W(x) \\neq 0$.\n\nAt a point $x_0$ where $W(x_0)=0$, we must analyze the limit definition of the derivative:\n$$ g_2'(x_0) = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{W(x_0+h)^2 - W(x_0)^2}{h} = \\lim_{h \\to 0} \\frac{W(x_0+h)^2}{h} $$\nWe can write this as $\\lim_{h \\to 0} \\left( \\frac{W(x_0+h) - W(x_0)}{h} \\cdot W(x_0+h) \\right)$.\nThe first factor, $\\frac{W(x_0+h) - W(x_0)}{h}$, does not have a limit as $h \\to 0$. The second factor, $W(x_0+h)$, approaches $W(x_0) = 0$ as $h \\to 0$ due to the continuity of $W$. While for some functions this `(undefined limit) * (zero limit)` can result in a defined limit of 0, the extreme oscillatory nature of the Weierstrass function prevents this. The quotient $\\frac{W(x_0+h)^2}{h}$ can be shown to not converge to a limit. Therefore, $g_2(x)$ is also nowhere differentiable.\n\n**C. $g_3(x) = \\sin(W(x))$**\n\nUsing the chain rule, the derivative would be $g_3'(x) = \\cos(W(x)) \\cdot W'(x)$.\nFor any $x_0$ where $\\cos(W(x_0)) \\neq 0$, the non-existence of $W'(x_0)$ implies the non-existence of $g_3'(x_0)$.\nWhat if $\\cos(W(x_0)) = 0$? This corresponds to points where $W(x_0) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + k\\pi$ for some integer $k$. At such a point, we again have a `(zero) * (undefined limit)` situation. A more detailed analysis using the limit definition, similar to the one for $g_2(x)$, shows that the derivative does not exist at these points either. The function $g_3(x)$ inherits the nowhere-differentiable property of $W(x)$.\n\n**D. $g_4(x) = \\int_0^x W(t) dt$**\n\nThis function is an integral of $W(t)$ with a variable upper limit. The First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus states that if a function $f$ is continuous on an interval $[a, b]$, then the function $F(x) = \\int_a^x f(t) dt$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ and differentiable on $(a, b)$, with $F'(x) = f(x)$.\n\nIn our problem, the function $W(t)$ is given to be continuous everywhere on $\\mathbb{R}$. Therefore, we can apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. The function $g_4(x) = \\int_0^x W(t) dt$ is differentiable for all real numbers $x$, and its derivative is $g_4'(x) = W(x)$.\n\nSince $g_4(x)$ is differentiable everywhere, it is certainly differentiable at one or more points.\n\nConclusion: Functions $g_1$, $g_2$, and $g_3$ are all nowhere differentiable.
