We do this by finding the supremum of $|f_n(x)|$ over the interval $[0, \\infty)$.\nFor any $n \\geq 1$, the term $\\sqrt{n^3+1}$ is positive. Also, the exponential function $\\exp(-nx)$ is always positive for real arguments $-nx$. Therefore, the absolute value is redundant:\n$$ |f_n(x)| = \\left| \\frac{\\exp(-nx)}{\\sqrt{n^3+1}} \\right| = \\frac{\\exp(-nx)}{\\sqrt{n^3+1}} $$\nTo find the supremum of this expression for $x \\in [0, \\infty)$, we need to find the maximum value of the term $\\exp(-nx)$. The denominator $\\sqrt{n^3+1}$ is a constant with respect to $x$.\n\nThe function $g(x) = \\exp(-nx)$ is a monotonically decreasing function of $x$ for $x \\geq 0$ (since $n \\geq 1$ is positive). Its derivative is $g'(x) = -n \\exp(-nx)$, which is negative for all $x$. Therefore, the maximum value of $\\exp(-nx)$ on the interval $[0, \\infty)$ occurs at the left endpoint, $x=0$.\nAt $x=0$, we have $\\exp(-n \\cdot 0) = \\exp(0) = 1$.\nThus, for any $x \\in [0, \\infty)$, we have $\\exp(-nx) \\leq 1$.\n\nThis allows us to bound $|f_n(x)|$:\n$$ |f_n(x)| = \\frac{\\exp(-nx)}{\\sqrt{n^3+1}} \\leq \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n^3+1}} $$\nThis inequality holds for all $x \\in [0, \\infty)$. We can therefore choose our sequence $M_n$ to be $M_n = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n^3+1}}$.

Let's select $x=N$.\nFor this choice of $x$, the sum becomes:\n$$ \\left| \\sum_{n=N+1}^{2N} \\frac{N}{n^2 + N^2} \\right| $$\nSince $N0$ and $n^2+N^2  0$ for all $n$, the terms are all positive, so the absolute value is redundant.\n$$ \\sum_{n=N+1}^{2N} \\frac{N}{n^2 + N^2} $$\nNow we find a lower bound for this sum. For the indices $n$ in the summation, we have $N+1 \\le n \\le 2N$.
