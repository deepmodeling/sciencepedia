A powerful technique is to restrict the function's domain to an interval where it is strictly monotonic. This exercise guides you through this fundamental process, asking you to find the largest possible domain on which a given quadratic function becomes invertible, a skill essential for defining inverse trigonometric and other important functions.", "problem": "Consider the function $f(x) = 2x^2 + 5x - 3$, defined for all real numbers $x$.

A sufficient and necessary condition for invertibility of a continuous function on an interval is that it be strictly monotone there; continuity of the inverse then follows because a continuous strictly monotone function on an interval is a homeomorphism onto its image.\n\nConsider $f(x)=2x^{2}+5x-3$. Since the leading coefficient $2$ is positive, $f$ is convex and has a unique vertex, which is its global minimum. The vertex occurs at the $x$-coordinate\n$$\nx_{0}=-\\frac{b}{2a}=-\\frac{5}{2\\cdot 2}=-\\frac{5}{4},\n$$\nusing the standard formula for a quadratic $ax^{2}+bx+c$.

If $ax_{0}$, then taking $t=x_{0}-a0$ gives $x_{1}=x_{0}-t=a$ and $x_{2}=x_{0}+t$, both in $[a,\\infty)$, with $f(x_{1})=f(x_{2})$, violating injectivity. Therefore $a$ cannot be less than $x_{0}$.\n\nOn the other hand, for $a\\geq x_{0}$, $f$ is strictly increasing on $[a,\\infty)$ because for $x\\geq x_{0}$ the derivative\n$$\nf'(x)=4x+5\n$$\nsatisfies $f'(x)\\geq 0$ with equality only at $x=x_{0}$, and the quadratic’s convexity ensures $f(x_{1})f(x_{2})$ whenever $x_{1}x_{2}$ in $[x_{0},\\infty)$. Thus $f$ is injective on $[a,\\infty)$ for any $a\\geq x_{0}$, and in particular on $[x_{0},\\infty)$. Since $f$ is continuous and strictly increasing on $[x_{0},\\infty)$, its inverse on its range is continuous.\n\nAmong intervals of the form $[a,\\infty)$ that make $f$ invertible, the largest domain corresponds to the smallest permissible $a$, namely $a=x_{0}=-\\frac{5}{4}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-\\frac{5}{4}}$$", "id": "1305964"}, {"introduction": "In many scientific applications, finding an explicit formula for an inverse function is algebraically impossible.
