We have two main approaches: a direct, brute-force calculation, or a more elegant approach using general properties of the defined transformations.\n\n**Method 1: Using General Logical Principles**\n\nFirst, let's analyze the relationship between the dual and the negation-complement transformations. The definitions are reminiscent of De Morgan's laws. For any formula $\\psi$ constructed from atomic variables using only $\\land$ and $\\lor$, a generalized version of De Morgan's laws, often proven by structural induction, states that:\n$$\n\\neg \\psi(P_1, \\dots, P_n) \\equiv \\psi^d(\\neg P_1, \\dots, \\neg P_n)\n$$\nBy substituting $\\neg P_i$ for each $P_i$ in this identity, we get:\n$$\n\\neg \\psi(\\neg P_1, \\dots, \\neg P_n) \\equiv \\psi^d(\\neg(\\neg P_1), \\dots, \\neg(\\neg P_n))\n$$\n$$\n\\neg \\psi(\\neg P_1, \\dots, \\neg P_n) \\equiv \\psi^d(P_1, \\dots, P_n)\n$$\nThe left side of this equivalence is exactly the definition of the negation-complement transformation, $\\mathcal{N}(\\psi)$. Thus, we have the powerful identity:\n$$\n\\mathcal{N}(\\psi) \\equiv \\psi^d\n$$\nThe problem asks for an expression equivalent to $\\mathcal{N}(\\Phi^d)$. We can apply the identity above by setting $\\psi = \\Phi^d$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{N}(\\Phi^d) \\equiv (\\Phi^d)^d\n$$\nThe dual transformation has the property that applying it twice returns the original formula, i.e., $(\\psi^d)^d \\equiv \\psi$ for any formula $\\psi$. This is because the second swap of $\\land$ and $\\lor$ operators restores the original operators.\nTherefore, we have:\n$$\n\\mathcal{N}(\\Phi^d) \\equiv \\Phi\n$$\nThe problem is now reduced to finding which of the given options are logically equivalent to the original formula $\\Phi(P, Q, R) = (P \\lor (Q \\land R)) \\land (Q \\lor R)$.\n\nLet's simplify $\\Phi$ using the laws of propositional logic. We apply the distributive law $(A \\lor B) \\land C \\equiv (A \\land C) \\lor (B \\land C)$:\n$$\n\\Phi \\equiv (P \\land (Q \\lor R)) \\lor ((Q \\land R) \\land (Q \\lor R))\n$$\nConsider the term $(Q \\land R) \\land (Q \\lor R)$. By the absorption law, $X \\land (X \\lor Y) \\equiv X$. Letting $X = Q \\land R$, we find that $(Q \\land R) \\land (Q \\lor R) \\equiv Q \\land R$.\nSubstituting this back, the expression for $\\Phi$ simplifies to:\n$$\n\\Phi \\equiv (P \\land (Q \\lor R)) \\lor (Q \\land R)\n$$\nNow, apply the distributive law $A \\land (B \\lor C) \\equiv (A \\land B) \\lor (A \\land C)$ to the first term:\n$$\n\\Phi \\equiv (P \\land Q) \\lor (P \\land R) \\lor (Q \\land R)\n$$\nThis is the Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) of the \"majority\" function, which evaluates to true if and only if at least two of the variables $P, Q, R$ are true.\n\nNow we check the options:\n*   **A. $(P \\land Q) \\lor (P \\land R) \\lor (Q \\land R)$**: This is exactly the simplified form of $\\Phi$. Thus, A is a correct answer.\n*   **B. $(P \\lor Q) \\land (P \\lor R) \\land (Q \\lor R)$**: This is the Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) of the majority function. We can prove its equivalence to option A algebraically:\n    $$\n    (P \\lor Q) \\land (P \\lor R) \\land (Q \\lor R)\n    $$\n    Using the distributive law $X \\lor (Y \\land Z) \\equiv (X \\lor Y) \\land (X \\lor Z)$ in reverse on the first two terms:\n    $$\n    \\equiv [P \\lor (Q \\land R)] \\land (Q \\lor R)\n    $$\n    This is precisely the original definition of $\\Phi$ that we started with, which we showed is equivalent to option A. Thus, B is also a correct answer.\n*   **C. $(\\neg P \\land \\neg Q) \\lor (\\neg P \\land \\neg R) \\lor (\\neg Q \\land \\neg R)$**: This formula is true if at least two of the variables are false. This is equivalent to $\\neg \\Phi$. For $P=Q=R=\\text{true}$, option A is true, but this option is false. Thus, C is incorrect.\n*   **D. $(P \\land \\neg Q \\land \\neg R) \\lor (\\neg P \\land Q \\land \\neg R) \\lor (\\neg P \\land \\neg Q \\land R) \\lor (P \\land Q \\land R)$**: This is the DNF for the exclusive-or (XOR) of three variables, $P \\oplus Q \\oplus R$. It is true if an odd number of variables are true. For $P=Q=\\text{true}, R=\\text{false}$, option A is true, but this option is false. Thus, D is incorrect.\n*   **E. $P \\lor Q \\lor R$**: This is true if at least one variable is true. For $P=\\text{true}, Q=R=\\text{false}$, this expression is true, but option A is false. Thus, E is incorrect.\n*   **F. $P \\land Q \\land R$**: This is true only if all variables are true. For $P=Q=\\text{true}, R=\\text{false}$, option A is true, but this option is false. Thus, F is incorrect.\n\nThus, the only correct options are A and B.\n\n**Method 2: Direct Calculation (Brute-Force)**\n\n1.  Start with $\\Phi = (P \\lor (Q \\land R)) \\land (Q \\lor R)$.\n2.  Compute its dual, $\\Phi^d$, by swapping $\\land$ and $\\lor$:\n    $$\n    \\Phi^d = (P \\land (Q \\lor R)) \\lor (Q \\land R)\n    $$\n3.
