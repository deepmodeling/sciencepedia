We need to check if this relation satisfies the three properties of an equivalence relation: reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity.\n\n**1. Reflexivity**\nTo check for reflexivity, we must determine if $x \\sim x$ for every $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. According to the definition of the relation, $x \\sim x$ is true if and only if $|x - x| \\le \\frac{3}{2}$.\nThe left side of the inequality is $|x - x| = |0| = 0$.\nSince $0 \\le \\frac{3}{2}$ is true, the condition for reflexivity is satisfied for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nTherefore, the relation $\\sim$ is **reflexive**.\n\n**2. Symmetry**\nTo check for symmetry, we must determine if $x \\sim y$ implies $y \\sim x$ for every $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nAssume $x \\sim y$. By the definition of the relation, this means $|x - y| \\le \\frac{3}{2}$.\nWe want to check if $y \\sim x$, which means we need to check if $|y - x| \\le \\frac{3}{2}$.\nWe know that for any real numbers $a$ and $b$, $|a - b| = |-(b - a)| = |b - a|$.\nApplying this property, we have $|y - x| = |x - y|$.\nSince we assumed $|x - y| \\le \\frac{3}{2}$, it follows directly that $|y - x| \\le \\frac{3}{2}$.\nThis means that $y \\sim x$.\nTherefore, the relation $\\sim$ is **symmetric**.\n\n**3. Transitivity**\nTo check for transitivity, we must determine if $(x \\sim y \\text{ and } y \\sim z)$ implies $x \\sim z$ for every $x, y, z \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nAssume $x \\sim y$ and $y \\sim z$.\nThe assumption $x \\sim y$ means $|x - y| \\le \\frac{3}{2}$.\nThe assumption $y \\sim z$ means $|y - z| \\le \\frac{3}{2}$.\nWe need to determine if it is always true that $x \\sim z$, which means $|x - z| \\le \\frac{3}{2}$.\n\nLet's use the triangle inequality for absolute values, which states that for any real numbers $a$ and $b$, $|a+b| \\le |a| + |b|$.\nWe can write $x - z$ as $(x - y) + (y - z)$. Applying the triangle inequality:\n$$|x - z| = |(x - y) + (y - z)| \\le |x - y| + |y - z|$$\nUsing our assumptions, we can substitute the upper bounds:\n$$|x - z| \\le \\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{3}{2} = 3$$\nThe result $|x - z| \\le 3$ does not guarantee that $|x - z| \\le \\frac{3}{2}$. This suggests that the relation might not be transitive. To prove it is not transitive, we must find a specific counterexample.\n\nLet's choose values for $x, y,$ and $z$ that satisfy the premises but fail the conclusion.\nLet $x = 0$, $y = 1$, and $z = 2$.\n- Check if $x \\sim y$: $|x - y| = |0 - 1| = 1$. Since $1 \\le \\frac{3}{2}$, we have $x \\sim y$.\n- Check if $y \\sim z$: $|y - z| = |1 - 2| = |-1| = 1$. Since $1 \\le \\frac{3}{2}$, we have $y \\sim z$.\n- Now, check if $x \\sim z$: $|x - z| = |0 - 2| = |-2| = 2$.\nSince $2 > \\frac{3}{2}$, the condition $|x-z| \\le \\frac{3}{2}$ is not met. Thus, $x$ is not related to $z$.\nWe have found a case where $x \\sim y$ and $y \\sim z$, but $x \\not\\sim z$.\nTherefore, the relation $\\sim$ is **not transitive**.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe relation $\\sim$ is reflexive and symmetric, but it is not transitive.

A relation must be reflexive, symmetric, and transitive to be an equivalence relation. While the problem statement asserts this is true, verifying it is a useful first step to understand the relation's structure.\n\n1.  **Reflexivity**: For any point $P_1 = (x_1, y_1) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$, we must check if $P_1 \\sim P_1$. This means we must check if $\\lfloor x_1 \\rfloor = \\lfloor x_1 \\rfloor$. Since this is always true, the relation is reflexive.\n\n2.  **Symmetry**: Suppose $P_1 \\sim P_2$ for two points $P_1 = (x_1, y_1)$ and $P_2 = (x_2, y_2)$. This means $\\lfloor x_1 \\rfloor = \\lfloor x_2 \\rfloor$. Since equality is a symmetric property, we can write $\\lfloor x_2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor x_1 \\rfloor$. This is the condition for $P_2 \\sim P_1$. Thus, the relation is symmetric.\n\n3.  **Transitivity**: Suppose $P_1 \\sim P_2$ and $P_2 \\sim P_3$ for three points $P_1 = (x_1, y_1)$, $P_2 = (x_2, y_2)$, and $P_3 = (x_3, y_3)$. The condition $P_1 \\sim P_2$ implies $\\lfloor x_1 \\rfloor = \\lfloor x_2 \\rfloor$. The condition $P_2 \\sim P_3$ implies $\\lfloor x_2 \\rfloor = \\lfloor x_3 \\rfloor$. By the transitive property of equality, we can conclude that $\\lfloor x_1 \\rfloor = \\lfloor x_3 \\rfloor$. This is the condition for $P_1 \\sim P_3$. Thus, the relation is transitive.\n\nSince the relation is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, it is indeed an equivalence relation. Now, we find the description of an equivalence class. The equivalence class of a point $P_0 = (x_0, y_0)$, denoted by $[P_0]$, is the set of all points $P=(x,y)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ such that $P \\sim P_0$.\n\nBy the definition of the relation $\\sim$, the condition $P \\sim P_0$ means that $\\lfloor x \\rfloor = \\lfloor x_0 \\rfloor$.\nLet's define $k = \\lfloor x_0 \\rfloor$. Since the floor function always returns an integer, $k$ is an integer.\nThe equivalence class $[P_0]$ is therefore the set of all points $(x,y)$ in the plane such that $\\lfloor x \\rfloor = k$.\n\nThe equation $\\lfloor x \\rfloor = k$ for an integer $k$ is equivalent to the inequality $k \\le x < k+1$.\nThe definition of the relation places no restriction on the $y$-coordinate. This means that $y$ can be any real number, i.e., $y \\in (-\\infty, \\infty)$.\n\nCombining these two conditions, the equivalence class is the set:\n$$ [P_0] = \\{ (x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid k \\le x < k+1 \\text{ and } y \\in \\mathbb{R} \\} $$\nwhere $k = \\lfloor x_0 \\rfloor$ is a specific integer determined by the initial point $P_0$.\n\nLet's analyze this set geometrically. The condition $k \\le x < k+1$ defines a vertical region between the lines $x=k$ and $x=k+1$. The region includes the left boundary line ($x=k$) but excludes the right boundary line ($x=k+1$). The condition $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$ means this region extends infinitely in both the positive and negative $y$ directions.\nThis geometric shape is an infinite vertical strip of width 1.\n\nNow we compare this description to the given options:\nA. A vertical line of the form $x=k$: This is only the left boundary of an equivalence class, not the entire class.\nB. An infinite horizontal strip: This would be the case if the relation was defined by the $y$-coordinates, i.e., $\\lfloor y_1 \\rfloor = \\lfloor y_2 \\rfloor$.\nC. A single point $(k, l)$: This is far too restrictive. The equivalence classes are infinite sets.\nD. An infinite vertical strip of the form $\\{(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid k \\le x < k+1\\}$ for some integer $k$: This precisely matches our derivation.\nE. A unit square: This would be the case if there were also a restriction on $y$, such as $l \\le y < l+1$.\n\nTherefore, the correct description of an equivalence class is given by option D.

The equivalence classes are therefore uniquely determined by the value of the sum of the components modulo 15.\n\nLet $k = (a+b) \\pmod{15}$.
