{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "A powerful strategy for determining a set's cardinality is to establish a one-to-one correspondence with a set whose size is already known. This exercise provides an excellent opportunity to practice this skill by considering a set whose elements are themselves infinite sequences. By recognizing that each arithmetic progression can be uniquely defined by two rational numbers, you can map this seemingly complex set to a much simpler one, revealing its true cardinality [@problem_id:2295286].", "problem": "An arithmetic progression is a sequence of numbers such that the difference between consecutive terms is constant. This constant difference is called the common difference. An arithmetic progression is uniquely determined by its first term, $a_1$, and its common difference, $d$. The sequence is given by $(a_1, a_1+d, a_1+2d, a_1+3d, \\dots)$.\n\nLet $\\mathcal{A}$ be the set of all possible arithmetic progressions where both the first term $a_1$ and the common difference $d$ are rational numbers.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly describes the cardinality of the set $\\mathcal{A}$?\n\nA. $\\mathcal{A}$ is a finite set.\n\nB. $\\mathcal{A}$ is a countably infinite set.\n\nC. $\\mathcal{A}$ has the same cardinality as the set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nD. $\\mathcal{A}$ has a cardinality strictly greater than the cardinality of the set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the cardinality of the set $\\mathcal{A}$, which is the set of all arithmetic progressions with rational first terms and rational common differences.\n\nAn arithmetic progression is uniquely defined by its first term, $a_1$, and its common difference, $d$. Therefore, we can establish a one-to-one correspondence (a bijection) between each arithmetic progression in the set $\\mathcal{A}$ and an ordered pair of numbers $(a_1, d)$.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, both $a_1$ and $d$ must be rational numbers. The set of all rational numbers is denoted by $\\mathbb{Q}$. So, for any arithmetic progression in $\\mathcal{A}$, we have $a_1 \\in \\mathbb{Q}$ and $d \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThis means that the ordered pair $(a_1, d)$ that uniquely defines each progression is an element of the Cartesian product of the set of rational numbers with itself, which is $\\mathbb{Q} \\times \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nThe bijection can be formally defined as a function $f: \\mathcal{A} \\to \\mathbb{Q} \\times \\mathbb{Q}$, where $f$ maps the progression $(a_1, a_1+d, a_1+2d, \\dots)$ to the ordered pair $(a_1, d)$. This function is clearly injective (one-to-one) because if two progressions map to the same pair $(a_1, d)$, they must be the same progression. It is also surjective (onto) because for any pair $(a_1, d) \\in \\mathbb{Q} \\times \\mathbb{Q}$, there exists a corresponding arithmetic progression in $\\mathcal{A}$.\n\nSince there is a bijection between the set $\\mathcal{A}$ and the set $\\mathbb{Q} \\times \\mathbb{Q}$, these two sets have the same cardinality. Therefore, to determine the cardinality of $\\mathcal{A}$, we must determine the cardinality of $\\mathbb{Q} \\times \\mathbb{Q}$.\n\nFirst, we recall a fundamental result from set theory: the set of rational numbers, $\\mathbb{Q}$, is countably infinite. A set is countably infinite if it can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the set of natural numbers $\\mathbb{N}$.\n\nNext, we use another key theorem from set theory: the Cartesian product of two countable sets is also a countable set. Since $\\mathbb{Q}$ is countable, the set $\\mathbb{Q} \\times \\mathbb{Q}$ must also be countable.\n\nSince the set $\\mathbb{Q}$ is infinite, the Cartesian product $\\mathbb{Q} \\times \\mathbb{Q}$ is also infinite. For example, pairs of the form $(n, 0)$ where $n$ is an integer form an infinite subset. Therefore, $\\mathbb{Q} \\times \\mathbb{Q}$ is not finite; it is countably infinite.\n\nBecause the set $\\mathcal{A}$ has the same cardinality as $\\mathbb{Q} \\times \\mathbb{Q}$, we conclude that $\\mathcal{A}$ is a countably infinite set.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\nA. $\\mathcal{A}$ is a finite set. This is incorrect, as there are infinitely many rational numbers to choose for $a_1$ and $d$.\nB. $\\mathcal{A}$ is a countably infinite set. This aligns with our derivation.\nC. $\\mathcal{A}$ has the same cardinality as the set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$. This is incorrect. The set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ is uncountably infinite, whereas we found $\\mathcal{A}$ to be countably infinite.\nD. $\\mathcal{A}$ has a cardinality strictly greater than the cardinality of the set of real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$. This is incorrect. The cardinality of $\\mathcal{A}$ is much smaller than that of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThus, the correct statement is that $\\mathcal{A}$ is a countably infinite set.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2295286"}, {"introduction": "After building familiarity with countable sets, we now turn to the profound concept of uncountability. This practice uses the familiar idea of decimal expansions to demonstrate how some infinite sets are fundamentally \"larger\" than the set of natural numbers. By restricting the digits allowed in a real number's decimal representation, we can construct sets that are either countable or, as a key part of this exercise shows, demonstrably uncountable, providing a concrete application of the logic behind Cantor's diagonal argument [@problem_id:1299950].", "problem": "Consider the following three sets of real numbers in the interval $(0, 1)$:\n\n-   Let $S_1$ be the set of all real numbers in $(0, 1)$ whose decimal expansion contains only the digit '1'.\n-   Let $S_2$ be the set of all real numbers in $(0, 1)$ whose decimal expansion contains only the digits '1' and '2'.\n-   Let $S_3$ be the set of all real numbers in $(0, 1)$ whose decimal expansion is terminating (i.e., contains only a finite number of non-zero digits).\n\nWhich of these sets are uncountable?\n\nA. $S_1$ only\n\nB. $S_2$ only\n\nC. $S_3$ only\n\nD. $S_1$ and $S_2$\n\nE. $S_2$ and $S_3$\n\nF.

The set of all infinite sequences over a two-element alphabet is uncountable by Cantor’s diagonal argument.

The problem explores what happens when a countable subset is \"removed\" from an uncountable one, a scenario exemplified by taking the rational numbers away from the real numbers. Solving this thought experiment solidifies a crucial theorem in set theory: an uncountable set is so vast that its cardinality remains unchanged even after losing a countably infinite number of elements [@problem_id:2295292].", "problem": "In digital information theory, we often analyze sets of infinite sequences.
