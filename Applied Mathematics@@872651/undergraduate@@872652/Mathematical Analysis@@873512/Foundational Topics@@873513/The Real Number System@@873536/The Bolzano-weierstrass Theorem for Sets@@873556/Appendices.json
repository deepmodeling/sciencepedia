The set of limit points of $S$, denoted $S'$, is the union of the limit points of $S_1$ and $S_2$. That is, $S' = (S_1)' \\cup (S_2)'$.\n\nLet's find the limit points of $S_1$. The set $S_1$ is the range of the sequence $a_n = 1 + \\frac{(-1)^n}{n}$. A point $L$ is a limit point of this set if there is a subsequence of $a_n$ that converges to $L$. Let's examine the limit of the sequence $a_n$ as $n \\to \\infty$.\nThe absolute value of the term $\\frac{(-1)^n}{n}$ is $|\\frac{(-1)^n}{n}| = \\frac{1}{n}$. As $n \\to \\infty$, $\\frac{1}{n} \\to 0$. By the Squeeze Theorem, this implies that $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^n}{n} = 0$.\nTherefore, the limit of the sequence $a_n$ is:\n$$ \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} a_n = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{(-1)^n}{n}\\right) = 1 + \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^n}{n} = 1 + 0 = 1 $$\nSince the sequence $\\{a_n\\}$ converges to 1, 1 is a limit point of the set $S_1$. As any subsequence of a convergent sequence must converge to the same limit, 1 is the only limit point of $S_1$. Thus, $(S_1)' = \\{1\\}$.\n\nNext, let's find the limit points of $S_2$. The set $S_2$ is the range of the sequence $b_n = -1 + \\frac{(-1)^n}{n}$. We use the same reasoning as for $S_1$. The limit of the sequence $b_n$ as $n \\to \\infty$ is:\n$$ \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} b_n = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left(-1 + \\frac{(-1)^n}{n}\\right) = -1 + \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^n}{n} = -1 + 0 = -1 $$\nSince the sequence $\\{b_n\\}$ converges to -1, -1 is a limit point of the set $S_2$. For the same reason as before, -1 is the only limit point of $S_2$. Thus, $(S_2)' = \\{-1\\}$.\n\nFinally, the set of all limit points of $S$ is the union of the sets of limit points of $S_1$ and $S_2$:\n$$ S' = (S_1)' \\cup (S_2)' = \\{1\\} \\cup \\{-1\\} = \\{-1, 1\\} $$\nThe limit points of the set $S$ are -1 and 1.\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be presented as a row matrix with the limit points listed in increasing order.
