This structure suggests using the AM-GM inequality to find a minimum value, as the product of the terms might be a constant if they are chosen carefully.\n\nThe challenge is that the product of $2x^2$ and $\\frac{512}{x^4}$ is not a constant because it depends on $x$. To resolve this, we can strategically split the term $2x^2$ into two identical terms: $x^2 + x^2$. The function can then be written as a sum of three terms:\n$$f(x) = x^2 + x^2 + \\frac{512}{x^4}$$\nNow, we can apply the AM-GM inequality to these three positive terms:\n$$ \\frac{x^2 + x^2 + \\frac{512}{x^4}}{3} \\ge \\sqrt[3]{(x^2) \\cdot (x^2) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{512}{x^4}\\right)} $$\nThe product of the terms inside the cube root simplifies significantly because the powers of $x$ cancel out:\n$$ \\sqrt[3]{x^4 \\cdot \\frac{512}{x^4}} = \\sqrt[3]{512} $$\nSince $8^3 = 512$, the cube root is 8. The inequality becomes:\n$$ \\frac{f(x)}{3} \\ge 8 $$\nMultiplying both sides by 3 gives us a lower bound for the function:\n$$ f(x) \\ge 24 $$\nThis shows that the minimum value of $f(x)$ is at least 24. To confirm that 24 is the global minimum, we need to check if this value can be achieved. According to the AM-GM inequality, equality holds if and only if all the terms are equal:\n$$ x^2 = \\frac{512}{x^4} $$\nMultiplying by $x^4$ (which is valid since $x>0$):\n$$ x^6 = 512 $$\nThis equation has a unique positive real solution $x = 512^{1/6}$. Since there is a value of $x$ for which the equality condition is met, the minimum value of 24 is achievable.\n\nTherefore, the global minimum value of the function is 24.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{24}$$", "id": "2288647"}, {"introduction": "The AM-GM inequality is a powerful tool for solving constrained optimization problems, often providing a more direct path than calculus. This exercise demonstrates how to maximize a product of variables subject to a linear constraint, a common scenario in resource allocation problems.

The 'performance index', $P$, of the compound is found to be dependent on the positive quantities, $x$, $y$, and $z$, of three precursor substances used in its synthesis, according to the formula $P(x,y,z) = x^3 y^2 z$. The cost of acquiring these precursors is not uniform: precursor X costs 3 monetary units per gram, precursor Y costs 2 monetary units per gram, and precursor Z costs 1 monetary unit per gram. The total budget allocated for the precursors in a single synthesis batch is fixed at 18 monetary units. Assuming the entire budget is spent, what is the maximum possible value of the performance index, $P$? Provide the exact numerical value.", "solution": "The problem is to maximize the performance index $P(x,y,z) = x^3 y^2 z$ given the budget constraint $3x + 2y + z = 18$, where $x, y, z$ are positive quantities.\n\nThis is a constrained optimization problem where we need to maximize a product given a linear constraint on the sum of variables. This is a classic application for the AM-GM inequality. The key is to transform the terms in the sum into terms whose product is related to $P$.\n\nThe exponents in the product $x^3 y^2 z$ are 3, 2, and 1. The sum of these exponents is $3+2+1=6$. This suggests we should apply the AM-GM inequality to a set of 6 terms. We can cleverly construct these terms from the budget constraint.\n\nLet's apply AM-GM to 6 terms constructed by repeating the components of the constraint according to the exponents in $P$: three copies of $x$, two copies of $y$, and one copy of $z$.\nThis approach doesn't work directly because the sum $x+x+x+y+y+z = 3x+2y+z$ is not what we have.\n\nA more effective strategy is to apply AM-GM to terms that correspond to the cost components: $3x, 2y, z$. To get the desired exponents on $x,y,z$ in the product, we can make substitutions. Let $u=3x, v=2y, w=z$. Then the constraint becomes simply $u+v+w=18$. We now express $P$ in terms of $u, v, w$:\n$$ x = \\frac{u}{3}, \\quad y = \\frac{v}{2}, \\quad z = w $$\n$$ P = \\left(\\frac{u}{3}\\right)^3 \\left(\\frac{v}{2}\\right)^2 w = \\frac{u^3 v^2 w}{3^3 \\cdot 2^2} = \\frac{u^3 v^2 w}{108} $$\nTo maximize $P$, we must maximize the numerator $Q = u^3 v^2 w$ subject to $u+v+w=18$.\n\nThe exponents in $Q$ are 3, 2, and 1. We can use AM-GM by applying it to terms that sum to $u+v+w$. Let's use 6 terms: three copies of $\\frac{u}{3}$, two copies of $\\frac{v}{2}$, and one copy of $w$. The sum of these 6 terms is:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{u}{3} + \\frac{u}{3} + \\frac{u}{3}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{v}{2} + \\frac{v}{2}\\right) + w = u + v + w = 18 $$\nNow, apply the AM-GM inequality to these six positive terms:\n$$ \\frac{\\text{Sum of terms}}{6} \\ge \\sqrt[6]{\\text{Product of terms}} $$\n$$ \\frac{18}{6} \\ge \\sqrt[6]{\\left(\\frac{u}{3}\\right)^3 \\left(\\frac{v}{2}\\right)^2 w} $$\n$$ 3 \\ge \\sqrt[6]{\\frac{u^3 v^2 w}{3^3 \\cdot 2^2}} = \\sqrt[6]{\\frac{Q}{108}} $$\nTo isolate $Q$, we raise both sides to the 6th power:\n$$ 3^6 \\ge \\frac{Q}{108} \\implies 729 \\ge \\frac{Q}{108} $$\n$$ Q \\le 729 \\cdot 108 $$\nNow substitute back into the expression for $P$:\n$$ P = \\frac{Q}{108} \\le \\frac{729 \\cdot 108}{108} = 729 $$\nSo, the maximum possible value of $P$ is 729.\n\nThis maximum is achieved when equality holds in the AM-GM inequality, which occurs when all the terms are equal:\n$$ \\frac{u}{3} = \\frac{v}{2} = w $$\nLet this common value be $k$. Then $u=3k, v=2k, w=k$. Substitute these into the constraint equation:\n$$ u+v+w = 3k+2k+k = 6k = 18 \\implies k = 3 $$\nThis gives the values for $u,v,w$ at the maximum: $u=9, v=6, w=3$. Finally, we find the corresponding values for $x, y, z$:\n$$ x = u/3 = 9/3 = 3 $$\n$$ y = v/2 = 6/2 = 3 $$\n$$ z = w = 3 $$\nThe maximum performance index is achieved when $x=y=z=3$, and its value is $P(3,3,3) = 3^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 3 = 3^6 = 729$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{729}$$", "id": "2288625"}, {"introduction": "Advanced applications of inequalities often require creative insight beyond direct formula substitution.
