Proving a number is irrational can be achieved by demonstrating that its sequence of digits can never settle into a repeating pattern.

Since there are infinitely many triangular numbers, there are infinitely many indices $k$ with $d_{k}=1$, so within one period block of length $p$ there must be at least one position with digit $1$. In any periodic binary sequence with at least one $1$ per period, the maximal number of consecutive zeros in the infinite tail is finite and bounded by the maximal zero-run length within one period (viewed cyclically), which is at most $p-1$. Therefore, under eventual periodicity, the gaps between successive indices $k$ with $d_{k}=1$ are bounded by some constant $G$ depending only on the periodic block.\n\nHowever, the $1$-digits occur exactly at triangular indices $T_{n}$, and the gaps between consecutive such indices are\n$$\nT_{n+1}-T_{n}=\\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}-\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}=n+1,\n$$\nwhich grow without bound as $n \\to \\infty$.
