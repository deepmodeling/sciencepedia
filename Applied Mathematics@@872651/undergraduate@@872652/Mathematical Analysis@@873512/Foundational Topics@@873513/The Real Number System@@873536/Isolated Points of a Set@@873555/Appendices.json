First, we must find the set $A$ itself. Then, we apply the definition of an isolated point to each element of $A$.\n\nStep 1: Determine the set $A$.\nThe set $A$ consists of all real numbers $x$ such that $x^2$ is a solution to the equation $y^2 - 13y + 36 = 0$. Let's solve this quadratic equation for $y$. We can factor the polynomial or use the quadratic formula.\nFactoring the quadratic expression: We need two numbers that multiply to 36 and add up to -13. These numbers are -4 and -9.\nSo, the equation becomes:\n$$ (y - 4)(y - 9) = 0 $$\nThe solutions for $y$ are $y = 4$ and $y = 9$.\n\nAccording to the problem description, the values of $x^2$ are these solutions. Thus, we have two conditions for the elements $x$ of the set $A$:\n1. $x^2 = 4$\n2. $x^2 = 9$\n\nFrom $x^2 = 4$, we find the real numbers $x = \\sqrt{4}$ and $x = -\\sqrt{4}$, which are $x = 2$ and $x = -2$.\nFrom $x^2 = 9$, we find the real numbers $x = \\sqrt{9}$ and $x = -\\sqrt{9}$, which are $x = 3$ and $x = -3$.\n\nCombining all these possible values for $x$, we construct the set $A$.\n$$ A = \\{-3, -2, 2, 3\\} $$\nThis is a finite set of four distinct points on the real number line.\n\nStep 2: Find the isolated points of $A$.\nWe need to check if each point in $A$ is an isolated point. A point $s \\in A$ is isolated if we can find a small open interval around it that contains no other points from $A$. Let's examine each point in $A$.\n\n- **Consider the point $s = -3$:** The other points in $A$ are $-2, 2, 3$. The closest point to $-3$ in $A$ is $-2$. The distance between them is $|-2 - (-3)| = 1$. If we choose an $\\epsilon$ that is less than this distance, say $\\epsilon = 0.5$, the open interval $(-3 - 0.5, -3 + 0.5) = (-3.5, -2.5)$ will contain $-3$ but no other points from $A$. Specifically, $(-3.5, -2.5) \\cap A = \\{-3\\}$. Therefore, $-3$ is an isolated point of $A$.\n\n- **Consider the point $s = -2$:** The other points in $A$ are $-3, 2, 3$. The distances to the other points are $|-3 - (-2)| = 1$, $|2 - (-2)| = 4$, and $|3 - (-2)| = 5$. The minimum distance to another point in $A$ is 1. If we choose $\\epsilon = 0.5$, the open interval $(-2 - 0.5, -2 + 0.5) = (-2.5, -1.5)$ contains $-2$. Since this interval does not contain $-3, 2,$ or $3$, we have $(-2.5, -1.5) \\cap A = \\{-2\\}$. Therefore, $-2$ is an isolated point of $A$.\n\n- **Consider the point $s = 2$:** The other points in $A$ are $-3, -2, 3$. The distances to the other points are $|-3 - 2| = 5$, $|-2 - 2| = 4$, and $|3 - 2| = 1$. The minimum distance to another point in $A$ is 1. If we choose $\\epsilon = 0.5$, the open interval $(2 - 0.5, 2 + 0.5) = (1.5, 2.5)$ contains $2$. This interval does not contain any other point from $A$. Thus, $(1.5, 2.5) \\cap A = \\{2\\}$. Therefore, $2$ is an isolated point of $A$.\n\n- **Consider the point $s = 3$:** The other points in $A$ are $-3, -2, 2$. The closest point to $3$ in $A$ is $2$. The distance is $|2 - 3| = 1$. If we choose $\\epsilon = 0.5$, the open interval $(3 - 0.5, 3 + 0.5) = (2.5, 3.5)$ contains $3$. This interval does not contain any other point from $A$. So, $(2.5, 3.5) \\cap A = \\{3\\}$. Therefore, $3$ is an isolated point of $A$.\n\nIn general, every point in a finite subset of $\\mathbb{R}$ is an isolated point.
