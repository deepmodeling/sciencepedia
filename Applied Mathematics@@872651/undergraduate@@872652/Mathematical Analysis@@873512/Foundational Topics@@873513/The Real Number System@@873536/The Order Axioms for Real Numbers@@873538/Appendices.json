If $x=cy$, then\n$$\nxy=c y^{2}\\ge 0.\n$$\nIf $y=cx$, then\n$$\nxy=c x^{2}\\ge 0.\n$$\nHence Statement 3 implies Statement 2.\n\nConversely, assume $xy\\ge 0$.

If $|x||y|0$, divide both sides by $|x||y|$ to get\n$$\n\\frac{x}{|x|}=\\frac{y}{|y|},\n$$\nwhich for real nonzero numbers forces $x$ and $y$ to have the same sign, hence $xy\\ge 0$.
