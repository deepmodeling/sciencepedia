For a monotonically increasing sequence that is bounded above, its supremum is equal to its limit. We will first establish that the sequence $(x_n)$ is monotonically increasing and bounded above.\n\nFirst, let's show that the sequence is monotonically increasing, i.e., $x_{n+1}  x_n$ for all $n \\geq 1$. We use mathematical induction.\nBase case ($n=1$):\nWe compare $x_2$ and $x_1$.\n$x_1 = C$\n$x_2 = \\frac{x_1}{k} + C = \\frac{C}{k} + C = C\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{k}\\right)$.\nSince $k  1$, we have $\\frac{1}{k}  0$.

Since $k  1$, we also have $\\frac{1}{k}  0$.\nTherefore, $\\frac{1}{k}(x_{m+1} - x_m)  0$, which implies $x_{m+2} - x_{m+1}  0$, or $x_{m+2}  x_{m+1}$.\nBy the principle of mathematical induction, the sequence $(x_n)$ is strictly increasing for all $n \\geq 1$.\n\nNext, let's show that the sequence is bounded above. Let's first identify a candidate for an upper bound. If the sequence converges to a limit $L$, then this limit must satisfy the recurrence relation:\n$L = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} x_{n+1} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(\\frac{x_n}{k} + C\\right) = \\frac{L}{k} + C$.\nSolving for $L$:\n$L - \\frac{L}{k} = C$\n$L\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{k}\\right) = C$\n$L\\left(\\frac{k-1}{k}\\right) = C$\n$L = \\frac{kC}{k-1}$.\nLet's prove by induction that $x_n \\leq \\frac{kC}{k-1}$ for all $n \\geq 1$.\n\nBase case ($n=1$):\n$x_1 = C$. We need to check if $C \\leq \\frac{kC}{k-1}$. Since $C  0$, we can divide by $C$ to get $1 \\leq \\frac{k}{k-1}$. As $k  1$, $k-1  0$.

We want to show that $x_{m+1} \\leq \\frac{kC}{k-1}$.\nFrom the recurrence relation, $x_{m+1} = \\frac{x_m}{k} + C$.\nUsing the inductive hypothesis, we have $x_m \\leq \\frac{kC}{k-1}$. Since $k  0$, dividing by $k$ preserves the inequality:\n$\\frac{x_m}{k} \\leq \\frac{1}{k} \\left(\\frac{kC}{k-1}\\right) = \\frac{C}{k-1}$.\nNow, adding $C$ to both sides:\n$x_{m+1} = \\frac{x_m}{k} + C \\leq \\frac{C}{k-1} + C$.\nSimplifying the right-hand side:\n$\\frac{C}{k-1} + C = \\frac{C + C(k-1)}{k-1} = \\frac{C + Ck - C}{k-1} = \\frac{Ck}{k-1}$.\nThus, $x_{m+1} \\leq \\frac{kC}{k-1}$.\nBy the principle of mathematical induction, the sequence $(x_n)$ is bounded above by $\\frac{kC}{k-1}$.\n\nSince the sequence $(x_n)$ is monotonically increasing and bounded above, the Monotone Convergence Theorem guarantees that it converges to a limit, say $L$. The supremum of a monotonically increasing and bounded sequence is its limit.\nTherefore, $\\sup S = L = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} x_n$.\nAs calculated before, the limit $L$ must satisfy $L = \\frac{L}{k} + C$, which gives $L = \\frac{kC}{k-1}$.\n\nThe supremum of the set $S$ is $\\frac{kC}{k-1}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{kC}{k-1}}$$", "id": "1284835"}]}
