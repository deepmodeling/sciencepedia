We can use the Limit Comparison Test to determine its convergence. This test is suitable when the general term $a_n$ is a ratio of expressions involving powers of $n$.\n\nFirst, we need to choose a simpler series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} b_n$ for comparison. We can find a suitable $b_n$ by examining the dominant terms in the numerator and denominator of $a_n$ as $n \\to \\infty$.\n\nIn the numerator, $n^2 + 5n\\sqrt{n} + 1 = n^2 + 5n^{3/2} + 1$, the term with the highest power of $n$ is $n^2$.\nIn the denominator, $n^5 - n^3\\sin(n^2) + 2\\ln(n)$, the term with the highest power of $n$ is $n^5$. The term $n^3\\sin(n^2)$ grows slower than $n^5$ because $|\\sin(n^2)| \\le 1$, and $\\ln(n)$ grows much slower than any positive power of $n$.\nSo, for large $n$, $a_n$ behaves like $\\frac{n^2}{n^5} = \\frac{1}{n^3}$.\n\nThis suggests we should compare our series with the series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} b_n$ where $b_n = \\frac{1}{n^3}$.\nThe series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^3}$ is a p-series with $p=3$. According to the p-series test, a series of the form $\\sum \\frac{1}{n^p}$ converges if $p > 1$ and diverges if $p \\le 1$. Since $p=3 > 1$, the comparison series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} b_n$ converges.\n\nNow, we apply the Limit Comparison Test by computing the limit $L = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{a_n}{b_n}$.\n$$L = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\frac{n^2 + 5n^{3/2} + 1}{n^5 - n^3\\sin(n^2) + 2\\ln(n)}}{\\frac{1}{n^3}}$$\n$$L = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{(n^2 + 5n^{3/2} + 1)n^3}{n^5 - n^3\\sin(n^2) + 2\\ln(n)}$$\n$$L = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{n^5 + 5n^{9/2} + n^3}{n^5 - n^3\\sin(n^2) + 2\\ln(n)}$$\nTo evaluate this limit, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by the highest power of $n$ in the denominator, which is $n^5$.\n$$L = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\frac{n^5}{n^5} + \\frac{5n^{9/2}}{n^5} + \\frac{n^3}{n^5}}{\\frac{n^5}{n^5} - \\frac{n^3\\sin(n^2)}{n^5} + \\frac{2\\ln(n)}{n^5}}$$\n$$L = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{1 + 5n^{-1/2} + n^{-2}}{1 - \\frac{\\sin(n^2)}{n^2} + \\frac{2\\ln(n)}{n^5}}$$\nNow we evaluate the limit of each term as $n \\to \\infty$:\n$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} 5n^{-1/2} = 0$\n$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} n^{-2} = 0$\n$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\sin(n^2)}{n^2} = 0$ (This follows from the Squeeze Theorem, since $-\\frac{1}{n^2} \\le \\frac{\\sin(n^2)}{n^2} \\le \\frac{1}{n^2}$ and $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\pm\\frac{1}{n^2} = 0$.)\n$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{2\\ln(n)}{n^5} = 0$ (Polynomial powers of $n$ grow faster than logarithmic functions.)\n\nSubstituting these values back into the limit expression for $L$:\n$$L = \\frac{1 + 0 + 0}{1 - 0 + 0} = 1$$\nThe Limit Comparison Test states that if $L$ is a finite, positive number ($0  L  \\infty$), then both series $\\sum a_n$ and $\\sum b_n$ either converge or diverge together.\nSince we found $L=1$, which satisfies $0  1  \\infty$, and we know that the comparison series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^3}$ converges, we can conclude that the original series $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} T_n$ also converges.\n\nThis means the total time required for the algorithm is finite. Therefore, the correct statement is that the series converges.\nOption D is incorrect because for $n$ large enough, all terms $T_n$ are positive, so the sequence of partial sums is monotonically increasing.
