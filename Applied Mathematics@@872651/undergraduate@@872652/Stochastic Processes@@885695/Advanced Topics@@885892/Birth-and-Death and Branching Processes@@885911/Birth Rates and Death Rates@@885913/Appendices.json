The state of the machine can be modeled as a continuous-time stochastic process. When the machine is in a 'working' state, it can break down. The time until a breakdown occurs is an exponential random variable with rate parameter $\\alpha$. Once the machine has failed, it enters a 'non-operational' state. This state includes both the time the machine is simply broken and the time it is actively 'under repair'. The total time it spends in this non-operational state before becoming 'working' again is an exponential random variable with rate parameter $\\beta$.\n\nDetermine the long-run availability of this machine. The availability is defined as the fraction of time, over a long period, that the machine is in the 'working' state.

The transition rates are: from W to N at rate $\\alpha$ (failure rate), and from N to W at rate $\\beta$ (repair rate). Because both rates are positive, the chain is irreducible and ergodic, so the long-run availability equals the stationary probability of being in state W.\n\nLet the stationary probabilities be $\\pi_{W}$ and $\\pi_{N}$ with $\\pi_{W}+\\pi_{N}=1$.
