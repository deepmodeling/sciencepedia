This exercise provides a classic real-world scenario of a processing system, challenging you to translate its characteristics into the fundamental $A/B/c$ form of Kendall's notation. Mastering this translation is the cornerstone of applying queuing theory to practical problems [@problem_id:1314503].", "problem": "A small financial technology company is modeling the performance of its trade execution system. Client orders arrive at the system's central queue. An analysis of historical data shows that the arrivals of these orders can be accurately modeled as a Poisson process. The system processes these orders using three identical, parallel execution engines. The time it takes for any single engine to process and execute an order is highly variable and has been found to follow an exponential distribution.\n\nUsing the standard A/B/c form of Kendall's notation to describe this queuing system, which of the following options is the correct classification?\n\nA. $D/M/3$\n\nB. $M/G/3$\n\nC. $M/M/1$\n\nD. $M/M/3$\n\nE. $G/G/3$", "solution": "We interpret the problem using Kendall's notation $A/B/c$, where:\n- A denotes the interarrival time distribution. A Poisson arrival process corresponds to exponential interarrival times, which is denoted by M (Markovian).\n- B denotes the service time distribution. An exponential service time is denoted by M (Markovian).\n- c denotes the number of parallel, identical servers. The system has three identical, parallel execution engines, so c equals 3.\n\nFrom the problem statement:\n- Client orders arrive according to a Poisson process, so A is M.\n- Each service time is exponentially distributed, so B is M.\n- There are three identical, parallel servers, so c is 3.\n\nTherefore, the system is an $M/M/3$ queue.

The arrival of passengers at this machine follows a Poisson process. The machine is highly consistent; it takes a fixed, constant amount of time, $T_s$, to scan the baggage for each passenger. An operations research student is tasked with modeling the queue that forms at this machine. The student proposes using Kendall's notation and models the system as an $M/M/1$ queue.\n\nWhich component of the student's $M/M/1$ notation is an incorrect representation of this physical scenario?\n\nA.

For a Poisson process with rate $\\lambda$, the interarrival times are independent and identically distributed exponential random variables with parameter $\\lambda$, having density $f_{X}(x)=\\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda x)$ for $x\\ge 0$, and exhibiting the memoryless property $P(X>s+t\\mid X>s)=P(X>t)$. In Kendall’s notation, this corresponds to the first symbol $M$ (“Markovian”) and is therefore correctly modeled by $M$.\n\nThe service time is given to be a fixed constant $T_{s}$ for every job. Thus the service-time random variable $S$ is deterministic, satisfying $P(S=T_{s})=1$, with cumulative distribution function $F_{S}(s)=0$ for $s<T_{s}$ and $F_{S}(s)=1$ for $s\\ge T_{s}$. This distribution is not exponential and does not possess the memoryless property. In Kendall’s notation, a deterministic service time is denoted by $D$, not $M$. Therefore, the second $M$ in $M/M/1$ is an incorrect representation; the appropriate model would be $M/D/1$.\n\nFinally, there is a single automated machine serving the queue, so $c=1$ is correct.\n\nHence, the incorrect component in the proposed $M/M/1$ model is the second $M$, which describes the service-time distribution.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1314526"}, {"introduction": "While many theoretical models assume infinite space, most real-world systems have physical or logical limits on how many customers they can hold. Kendall's notation can be extended to capture these finite capacity constraints, which are crucial for realistic analysis. This problem introduces this extended notation and asks you to calculate a key system parameter based on it, connecting the symbolic model directly to a tangible operational constraint [@problem_id:1314546].", "problem": "An automated kiosk at a busy airport terminal dispenses travel essentials. The system features two identical dispensing machines that operate in parallel. The time it takes for a machine to process an order and dispense an item is a fixed, constant duration. Customer arrivals at the kiosk are random and can be modeled by a Poisson process. Due to space constraints, the total number of customers that can be present at the kiosk—either being served by one of the machines or waiting in line—is limited to a maximum of 10. If a new customer arrives when the kiosk is already at full capacity, they cannot join the queue and leave immediately.\n\nWhat is the maximum number of customers that can be waiting in line for a machine to become available?", "solution": "Let $K$ denote the total system capacity (customers in service plus in queue) and let $c$ denote the number of identical servers (machines). Given $K=10$ and $c=2$, let $N$ be the number in the system, $S$ the number in service, and $Q$ the number waiting. By definition,\n$$\nN = S + Q.\n$$\nA work-conserving parallel-server system (identical machines with a common queue) cannot have idle servers when $Q>0$. Therefore, the maximum number waiting occurs when the system is full and both servers are busy, i.e., when $N=K$ and $S=c$. Hence,\n$$\nQ_{\\max} = K - c = 10 - 2 = 8.\n$$\nThe Poisson arrivals and deterministic service time do not affect this structural maximum; only $K$ and $c$ matter for the bound.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{8}$$", "id": "1314546"}]}
