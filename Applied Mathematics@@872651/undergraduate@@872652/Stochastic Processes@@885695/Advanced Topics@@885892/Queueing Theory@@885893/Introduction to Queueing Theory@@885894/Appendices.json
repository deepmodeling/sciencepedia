During peak hours, it has been observed that student arrivals can be modeled as a Poisson process with an average rate of 50 customers per hour. The time it takes for the Robo-rista to process an order, prepare the drink, and serve it to a customer is found to be exponentially distributed with a mean service time of 65 seconds per customer.\n\nAssuming the system operates under steady-state conditions, calculate the probability that a student arriving at the kiosk can place their order immediately without having to wait in line. Express your answer as a decimal, rounded to three significant figures.", "solution": "This problem can be modeled as a single-server queueing system. The key characteristics are:\n1.  The arrival process is a Poisson process. This corresponds to the first 'M' in Kendall's notation (for Markovian or memoryless inter-arrival times).\n2.  The service time distribution is exponential. This corresponds to the second 'M' in Kendall's notation (for Markovian or memoryless service times).\n3.  There is a single server (the Robo-rista kiosk). This corresponds to the '1' in Kendall's notation.\n\nThus, we are dealing with an M/M/1 queue.\n\nThe question asks for the probability that a newly arriving customer does not have to wait. In a single-server system, this occurs if and only if the system is empty (the server is idle) upon the customer's arrival. For a system with Poisson arrivals, the PASTA (Poisson Arrivals See Time Averages) property applies. This means the proportion of arrivals that find the system in a certain state is equal to the long-run proportion of time the system is in that state. Therefore, the probability we need to find is the steady-state probability of the system being empty, denoted as $P_0$.\n\nFirst, we must define and calculate the mean arrival rate ($\\lambda$) and the mean service rate ($\\mu$) in consistent units. Let's use customers per hour.\n\nThe problem gives the mean arrival rate directly:\n$$ \\lambda = 50 \\text{ customers/hour} $$\n\nThe problem gives the mean service time, which is the reciprocal of the mean service rate $\\mu$:\n$$ \\text{Mean service time} = \\frac{1}{\\mu} = 65 \\text{ seconds} $$\n\nWe need to convert this to hours to be consistent with $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\mu} = 65 \\text{ s} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ minute}}{60 \\text{ s}} \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ hour}}{60 \\text{ minutes}} = \\frac{65}{3600} \\text{ hours/customer} $$\n\nNow, we can find the service rate $\\mu$ in customers per hour:\n$$ \\mu = \\frac{1}{65/3600} = \\frac{3600}{65} \\text{ customers/hour} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the traffic intensity or server utilization, $\\rho$. This is a dimensionless quantity defined as the ratio of the arrival rate to the service rate. For a steady-state to exist, we must have $\\rho < 1$.\n$$ \\rho = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\mu} $$\nSubstituting the values for $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$:\n$$ \\rho = \\frac{50}{3600/65} = \\frac{50 \\times 65}{3600} = \\frac{3250}{3600} = \\frac{325}{360} $$\n\nWe can simplify this fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor. Both are divisible by 5:\n$$ \\rho = \\frac{325 \\div 5}{360 \\div 5} = \\frac{65}{72} $$\nSince $65 < 72$, $\\rho < 1$, which confirms that the system is stable and has a steady-state distribution.\n\nFor an M/M/1 queue, the steady-state probability that the system is empty, $P_0$, is given by the formula:\n$$ P_0 = 1 - \\rho $$\nSubstituting the value of $\\rho$ we found:\n$$ P_0 = 1 - \\frac{65}{72} = \\frac{72}{72} - \\frac{65}{72} = \\frac{7}{72} $$\nThis is the exact probability that an arriving student does not have to wait.\n\nFinally, we need to express this as a decimal rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ P_0 = \\frac{7}{72} \\approx 0.097222... $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we look at the first three non-zero digits, which are 9, 7, and 2. The fourth significant digit is 2, which is less than 5, so we round down (i.e., we do not change the third significant digit).\n$$ P_0 \\approx 0.0972 $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.0972}$$", "id": "1310538"}, {"introduction": "Our analysis so far has focused on systems with exponentially distributed service times, which implies a high degree of variability.
