This exercise provides practice in connecting the number of individual steps to the final displacement using the binomial distribution. You will calculate the probability that a biased random walk, modeling a physical scenario like charge carrier drift, ends up in a positive position after a fixed number of steps.

An electron is initially located at a lattice site designated as the origin, $x=0$. At discrete time steps, the electron hops to an adjacent site. Due to an external electric field, the probability of the electron hopping one site to the right (in the positive direction) is $p$, and the probability of it hopping one site to the left (in the negative direction) is $1-p$.\n\nSuppose the probability of a hop to the right is $p = 0.4$. If the electron undergoes a total of $N=5$ hops, what is the probability that its final position is positive (i.e., $x > 0$)?
