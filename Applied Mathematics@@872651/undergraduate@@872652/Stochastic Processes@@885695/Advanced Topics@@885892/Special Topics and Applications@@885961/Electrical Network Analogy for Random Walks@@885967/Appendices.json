The random walk is defined by transition probabilities proportional to the weight of the edges. The weight of the edge between vertices $A$ and $B$ is given as $w_{AB}$, and the weight of the edge between vertices $B$ and $C$ is $w_{BC}$. It is known that $w_{AB} = 2w_{BC}$.

Consider a simplified model of such a network consisting of $n$ nodes, where $n \\geq 2$. The connection between any pair of distinct nodes is a resistive link, and every link in the network has the same electrical resistance $R$.\n\nYour task is to determine the effective electrical resistance between any two arbitrarily chosen distinct nodes in this network. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $n$ and $R$.", "solution": "Let the set of $n$ nodes be $V = \\{v_1, v_2, ..., v_n\\}$. We want to find the effective resistance, $R_{eff}$, between two arbitrary distinct nodes, let's call them $A$ and $B$. Without loss of generality, let $A = v_1$ and $B = v_2$.\n\nTo find the effective resistance, we can connect an ideal voltage source with voltage $V_0$ across nodes $A$ and $B$. The total current $I$ that flows from the source into node $A$ and out of node $B$ is related to $R_{eff}$ by Ohm's law: $R_{eff} = \\frac{V_0}{I}$.\n\nLet's set the electric potential at node $A$ to be $V_A$ and at node $B$ to be $V_B$. The potential difference is $V_0 = V_A - V_B$. Due to the symmetry of the network, we can choose a convenient potential reference. Let's set the potentials such that $V_A = \\frac{V_0}{2}$ and $V_B = -\\frac{V_0}{2}$.\n\nNow consider the remaining $n-2$ nodes, $\\{v_3, v_4, ..., v_n\\}$. Let's call this set $S$. Each node $v_k \\in S$ is connected to node $A$ by a resistor $R$ and to node $B$ by a resistor $R$. For any node $v_k \\in S$, its position in the network is completely symmetric with respect to nodes $A$ and $B$. The potential at any node $v_k$ must be the same due to this symmetry. The potential at these nodes must be exactly halfway between $V_A$ and $V_B$ if we only considered the sub-circuit of $A$, $B$, and $v_k$. By superposition and symmetry over all nodes, we can argue that the potential of all nodes in $S$ must be 0. Let's denote the potential of any node in $S$ as $V_S$. So, $V_S = 0$.\n\nOur goal is to find the total current $I$ entering node $A$. We can use Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at node $A$. The total current $I$ is the sum of the currents flowing out of node $A$ through all the links connected to it.\n\nThere is one link from node $A$ to node $B$.
