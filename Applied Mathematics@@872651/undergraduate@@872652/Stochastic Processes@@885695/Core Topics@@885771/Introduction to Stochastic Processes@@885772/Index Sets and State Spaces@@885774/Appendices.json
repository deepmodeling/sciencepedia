An entomologist records the number of active beehives on the first day of each month to track the apiary's health.

It is possible for the apiary to have zero active hives.\n\nLet the stochastic process be denoted by $\\{X_n\\}$, where $X_n$ represents the number of active beehives recorded at the start of the $n$-th month of the study, with $n=1$ corresponding to January 2023.\n\nFor this stochastic process, identify the index set $T$ and the state space $S$.\n\nA. $T = \\{1, 2, \\dots, 36\\}$, $S = \\{0, 1, \\dots, 60\\}$\n\nB. $T = \\{0, 1, \\dots, 60\\}$, $S = \\{1, 2, \\dots, 36\\}$\n\nC. $T = [1, 36]$, $S = [0, 60]$\n\nD. $T = \\{1, 2, 3, \\dots\\}$, $S = \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots\\}$\n\nE. $T = \\{1, 2, \\dots, 36\\}$, $S = \\{1, 2, \\dots, 60\\}$", "solution": "We are given a stochastic process $\\{X_{n}\\}$ where $X_{n}$ is the number of active beehives recorded at the start of the $n$-th month, with $n=1$ corresponding to January 2023, and the final observation on December 1, 2025. By definition, the index set $T$ is the set of time indices at which the process is observed, and the state space $S$ is the set of all possible values that $X_{n}$ can take.\n\nFirst, determine the number of observation times.

The time $t$ is measured in days, with $t=0$ corresponding to the beginning of the study. The location $X_t$ is given by a pair of coordinates: (latitude, longitude). The latitude is a real number in degrees, constrained to the interval $[-90, 90]$, where $-90$ corresponds to the South Pole and $+90$ corresponds to the North Pole. The longitude is a real number in degrees, constrained to the interval $[-180, 180]$.\n\nBased on this description, identify the most appropriate classification for the index set $T$ and the state space $S$ of this stochastic process.\n\nA.

The index set represents the \"time\" component of the process. The problem states that the whale's location is monitored \"at every instant in time\" over a period of one year. The time variable $t$ is measured in days, starting from $t=0$. A one-year period means the monitoring ends at $t=365$ (or 365.25, but the exact endpoint does not change the nature of the set). The phrase \"at every instant\" signifies that time is not advancing in discrete steps (like once per hour or once per day), but is flowing continuously. Therefore, the index $t$ can take any real value within the interval from 0 to 365. The index set is $T = [0, 365]$. Since this set is a continuous interval of real numbers, the process is a continuous-time process.\n\nSecond, let's analyze the state space $S$. The state space is the set of all possible values that the random variables $X_t$ can take. In this problem, the state at time $t$, $X_t$, is the whale's exact location, given by the pair (latitude, longitude).\nThe latitude is defined as a real number within the closed interval $[-90, 90]$.\nThe longitude is defined as a real number within the closed interval $[-180, 180]$.\nThe state $X_t$ is therefore a point in a two-dimensional space. The set of all possible states, the state space $S$, is the Cartesian product of the possible values for latitude and longitude.\n$$S = [-90, 90] \\times [-180, 180]$$\nThis set is a rectangular region in the two-dimensional Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Since the latitude and longitude can be any real numbers within their respective ranges, the state space is a continuous set. A process with a continuous state space is a continuous state-space process.\n\nCombining our findings, the stochastic process is both continuous-time (continuous index set) and has a continuous state space. Now we evaluate the given options:\n- A. The process has a discrete index set and a discrete state space. This is incorrect. Both are continuous.\n- B. The process has a discrete index set and a continuous state space. This is incorrect. The index set is continuous.\n- C. The process has a continuous index set and a discrete state space. This is incorrect. The state space is continuous.\n- D. The process has a continuous index set and a continuous state space. This is correct. It accurately reflects our analysis.\n- E. The index set is the set of all real numbers, $\\mathbb{R}$, and the state space is the set of all points in the 2D plane, $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This is incorrect. While both sets are continuous, this option is not precise. The index set is not the entire set of real numbers but a finite interval, $T = [0, 365]$. Similarly, the state space is not the entire 2D plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$, but a bounded rectangular subset of it, $S = [-90, 90] \\times [-180, 180]$. Option D provides a better classification of the *type* of sets involved, without making factually incorrect statements about their bounds.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate classification is that the process has a continuous index set and a continuous state space.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1308667"}, {"introduction": "This final practice challenges us to combine the concepts we've seen, highlighting that the index set and state space can be of different types.
