For each tire position on the truck, the sequence of tire failures and replacements constitutes a renewal process. The \"time\" in this context is the distance traveled in miles. We need to find the expected number of renewals (replacements) over a total distance of $D = 2,000,000$ miles.\n\nLet's denote the number of front tires by $n_F = 2$ and the number of rear tires by $n_R = 4$.\nThe mean lifetime of a front tire is $\\mu_F = 50,000$ miles.\nThe mean lifetime of a rear tire is $\\mu_R = 80,000$ miles.\nThe total distance of the journey is $D = 2,000,000$ miles.\n\nWe can analyze the front and rear tires separately and then sum their expected replacements.\n\nFirst, consider the front tires.\nFor a single front tire position, the sequence of replacements is a renewal process with mean inter-arrival time (lifetime) $\\mu_F$. Let $N_F(D)$ be the number of replacements for one front tire position over the distance $D$. The Elementary Renewal Theorem states that for a renewal process with mean inter-arrival time $\\mu$, the long-run average rate of renewals is $1/\\mu$. For a large time interval $t$, the expected number of renewals is approximately $E[N(t)] \\approx \\frac{t}{\\mu}$.\nSince the journey distance $D$ is much larger than the mean tire lifetime $\\mu_F$, we can use this approximation to estimate the expected number of replacements for one front tire position:\n$$E[\\text{replacements for one front tire}] \\approx \\frac{D}{\\mu_F}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$E[\\text{replacements for one front tire}] = \\frac{2,000,000 \\text{ miles}}{50,000 \\text{ miles}} = 40$$\nSince there are $n_F = 2$ front tires, and the lifetimes are independent, the total expected number of front tire replacements is the sum of the expected replacements for each position. By linearity of expectation:\n$$E[\\text{total front replacements}] = n_F \\times E[\\text{replacements for one front tire}] = 2 \\times 40 = 80$$\n\nNext, we follow the same logic for the rear tires.\nFor a single rear tire position, the mean lifetime is $\\mu_R = 80,000$ miles.\nThe expected number of replacements for one rear tire position over the distance $D$ is:\n$$E[\\text{replacements for one rear tire}] \\approx \\frac{D}{\\mu_R}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$E[\\text{replacements for one rear tire}] = \\frac{2,000,000 \\text{ miles}}{80,000 \\text{ miles}} = 25$$\nThere are $n_R = 4$ rear tires. The total expected number of rear tire replacements is:\n$$E[\\text{total rear replacements}] = n_R \\times E[\\text{replacements for one rear tire}] = 4 \\times 25 = 100$$\n\nFinally, the total expected number of replacement tires for the entire truck is the sum of the expected replacements for the front and rear tires:\n$$E[\\text{total replacements}] = E[\\text{total front replacements}] + E[\\text{total rear replacements}]$$\n$$E[\\text{total replacements}] = 80 + 100 = 180$$\n\nSo, the expected total number of replacement tires needed for the journey is 180.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{180}$$", "id": "1293701"}, {"introduction": "Often, our interest extends beyond simply counting events to understanding the financial implications, such as operational and replacement costs.
