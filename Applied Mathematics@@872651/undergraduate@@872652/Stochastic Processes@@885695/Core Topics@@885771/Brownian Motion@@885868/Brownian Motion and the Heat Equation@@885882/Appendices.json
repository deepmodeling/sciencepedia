A powerful result from the theory of stochastic processes, known as the Feynman-Kac formula, provides a probabilistic representation for the solution. For an initial temperature distribution $u(x,0) = f(x)$, the temperature at a point $x$ and time $t$ can be calculated as the expected value $u(x,t) = E[f(x + W_t)]$.

The property of independent increments of Brownian motion ensures that future temperature changes are independent of the past, forcing the temperature at the origin to average to its initial value of $f(0)=0$.\n\nB. The Markov property of Brownian motion dictates that the temperature at the origin depends only on its most recent state, which is zero.\n\nC. The probability distribution of the Brownian motion displacement $W_t$ is symmetric about the origin. This symmetry, combined with the anti-symmetry of the odd function $f(x)$, causes the contributions to the expected value from positive and negative displacements to cancel each other out.\n\nD. The law of the iterated logarithm, which describes the magnitude of the oscillations of a Brownian path, implies that a particle is equally likely to be found on either side of the origin, leading to a net-zero temperature.\n\nE.
