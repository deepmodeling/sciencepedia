The random variable $Y = W(4)$ is, by property 3 of the Wiener process (with $s=0, t=4$), normally distributed with mean 0 and variance $4-0=4$. So, $Y \\sim N(0, 4)$. Since the normal distribution is symmetric about its mean, the probability of being less than the mean is exactly $1/2$.\n$$\\mathbb{P}(Y  0) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\nNext, we evaluate the numerator, $\\mathbb{P}(X  0 \\text{ and } Y  0)$. To handle the joint probability, we can express $Y$ in terms of $X$ and an independent increment. We can write $W(4)$ as:\n$$W(4) = W(1) + (W(4) - W(1))$$\nLet $X = W(1)$ and define a new random variable $Z = W(4) - W(1)$.\nFrom the properties of the Wiener process:\n- $X = W(1) \\sim N(0, 1)$.\n- $Z = W(4) - W(1) \\sim N(0, 4-1) = N(0, 3)$.\n- Since the time intervals $(0, 1]$ and $(1, 4]$ are non-overlapping, the increments $W(1)-W(0)=X$ and $W(4)-W(1)=Z$ are independent.\n\nThe joint probability can now be written in terms of these independent random variables:\n$$\\mathbb{P}(X  0 \\text{ and } X+Z  0)$$\nThe problem is now to find the probability that the pair of independent random variables $(X, Z)$ falls into the region defined by $x  0$ and $z  -x$.\n\nThe joint probability density function of $(X, Z)$ is the product of their individual densities, since they are independent:\n$$f_{X,Z}(x,z) = f_X(x) f_Z(z) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi \\cdot 3}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z^2}{6}\\right)$$\nThe level sets of this distribution are ellipses.

The joint distribution of $(X, Z')$ is radially symmetric about the origin.\n\nFor a radially symmetric distribution, the probability of the random vector $(X, Z')$ falling into an angular sector originating from the origin is proportional to the angle of that sector. The probability is the ratio of the sector's angle to the total angle $2\\pi$.\n\nWe must express the inequalities in terms of $X$ and $Z'$:\n1. $X  0$ remains the same.
