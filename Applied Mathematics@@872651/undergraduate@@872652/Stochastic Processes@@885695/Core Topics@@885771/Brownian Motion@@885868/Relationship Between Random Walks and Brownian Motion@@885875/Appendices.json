To ensure our model behaves like a real diffusive process, the step size in space, $\\Delta x$, must be proportional to the square root of the step size in time, $\\Delta t$. This first practice invites you to explore a direct consequence of this scaling: its effect on the variance of the particle's position. By calculating the mean squared displacement, you will uncover a fundamental property that holds true in the continuous limit [@problem_id:1330627].", "problem": "A simplified one-dimensional model for the diffusion of a particle in a fluid is constructed as follows.

This interval is discretized into $N$ individual time steps, each of duration $\\Delta t = T/N$.\n\nAt the end of each time step, the particle makes a jump. The jump is a displacement of magnitude $\\Delta x$ either to the positive direction (right) or the negative direction (left), with an equal probability of $1/2$ for each choice. The magnitude of the spatial jump is coupled to the temporal step size via the scaling relation $\\Delta x = \\sqrt{\\Delta t}$.\n\nLet $Y_i$ be a random variable for the $i$-th jump, such that $Y_i = +1$ for a jump to the right and $Y_i = -1$ for a jump to the left.

This property acts like an intrinsic clock for the process, ticking with every squared jump. This exercise demonstrates a remarkable result: for a properly scaled random walk, the quadratic variation converges to a deterministic value, not a random one.
