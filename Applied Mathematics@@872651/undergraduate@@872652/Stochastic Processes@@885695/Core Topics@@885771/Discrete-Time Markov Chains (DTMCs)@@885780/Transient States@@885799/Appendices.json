At each discrete time step, if the particle is at a site $k$ where $0  k  N$, it moves to site $k-1$ with probability $p=1/2$ or to site $k+1$ with probability $q=1/2$.\n\nThe sites at the ends of the line, $0$ and $N$, are absorbing barriers. This means that if the particle ever reaches site $0$ or site $N$, it remains at that site for all subsequent time steps.\n\nIn the context of stochastic processes, states of a system are classified as either recurrent or transient.
