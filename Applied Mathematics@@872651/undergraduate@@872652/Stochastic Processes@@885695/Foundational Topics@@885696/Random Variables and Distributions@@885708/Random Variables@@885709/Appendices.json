Calculate the probability that a particle will be detected within the next $t_{interval} = 15.0$ seconds.\n\nRound your final answer to three significant figures.", "solution": "Let $T$ be the continuous random variable representing the time in seconds until the next alpha particle is detected. The problem states that $T$ follows an exponential distribution.\n\nThe probability density function (PDF) of an exponential distribution is given by $f(t) = \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda t)$ for $t \\ge 0$, where $\\lambda$ is the rate parameter. The mean of the exponential distribution is related to the rate parameter by $\\mu = 1/\\lambda$.\n\nFrom the problem statement, the mean time between detections is $\\tau = 40.0$ seconds.\nTherefore, the rate parameter $\\lambda$ is:\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{1}{\\tau} = \\frac{1}{40.0} \\, \\text{s}^{-1} $$\n\nWe are asked to find the probability that a particle is detected within the next $t_{interval} = 15.0$ seconds, given that no particle has been detected for the past $t_{wait} = 60.0$ seconds. This is a conditional probability.\n\nLet $A$ be the event that a particle is detected within the time interval $(t_{wait}, t_{wait} + t_{interval})$. This can be written as $t_{wait}  T  t_{wait} + t_{interval}$.\nLet $B$ be the event that no particle was detected in the first $t_{wait}$ seconds. This can be written as $T  t_{wait}$.\n\nWe need to calculate $P(A | B) = P(t_{wait}  T  t_{wait} + t_{interval} | T  t_{wait})$.\nLet's substitute the given values:\n$t_{wait} = 60.0$ s\n$t_{interval} = 15.0$ s\nThe probability we need to find is $P(60.0  T  75.0 | T  60.0)$.\n\nA key feature of the exponential distribution is its **memoryless property**. This property states that for any $s  0$ and $t  0$:\n$$ P(T  s + t | T  s) = P(T  t) $$\nThis means the probability that the event occurs in the next $t$ seconds is independent of how long we have already waited ($s$ seconds).\n\nWe are seeking the probability of detection *within* the next interval, which is the complement of *not* detecting in that interval. Let's rephrase our problem using the survival function $P(Tt)$. The probability we want is:\n$$ P(T  60.0 + 15.0 | T  60.0) = 1 - P(T  60.0 + 15.0 | T  60.0) $$\n$$ = 1 - P(T  75.0 | T  60.0) $$\nApplying the memoryless property with $s = 60.0$ and $t = 15.0$:\n$$ P(T  75.0 | T  60.0) = P(T  15.0) $$\nSo, the probability we seek becomes:\n$$ 1 - P(T  15.0) = P(T \\le 15.0) $$\nThis confirms that due to the memoryless nature of the process, the 60.0 seconds of waiting has no effect on the future probability.
