A key property of the multivariate normal distribution is that any linear transformation of a jointly normal vector results in another jointly normal vector. Here, the vector $(U, V)$ is a linear transformation of the vector $(X, Y)$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} U \\\\ V \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  a \\\\ 1  -a \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} X \\\\ Y \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nTherefore, $U$ and $V$ are also jointly normal random variables.\n\nAnother fundamental property of jointly normal variables is that they are statistically independent if and only if their covariance is zero. Our goal is to find the value of $a$ that makes $U$ and $V$ independent, which is equivalent to finding $a$ such that $\\text{Cov}(U, V) = 0$.\n\nWe can compute the covariance of $U$ and $V$ using the properties of the covariance operator. Specifically, for random variables $W_1, W_2, W_3, W_4$ and constants $c_1, c_2$, covariance is bilinear: $\\text{Cov}(c_1 W_1 + c_2 W_2, W_3) = c_1 \\text{Cov}(W_1, W_3) + c_2 \\text{Cov}(W_2, W_3)$.\n\nLet's expand the expression for $\\text{Cov}(U, V)$:\n$$\n\\text{Cov}(U, V) = \\text{Cov}(X + aY, X - aY)\n$$\nUsing the bilinearity of covariance, we can expand this expression as:\n$$\n\\text{Cov}(U, V) = \\text{Cov}(X, X - aY) + \\text{Cov}(aY, X - aY)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Cov}(U, V) = \\text{Cov}(X, X) - \\text{Cov}(X, aY) + \\text{Cov}(aY, X) - \\text{Cov}(aY, aY)\n$$\nNow, we use the property $\\text{Cov}(c_1 W_1, c_2 W_2) = c_1 c_2 \\text{Cov}(W_1, W_2)$ and the definition $\\text{Var}(W) = \\text{Cov}(W, W)$:\n$$\n\\text{Cov}(U, V) = \\text{Var}(X) - a\\text{Cov}(X, Y) + a\\text{Cov}(Y, X) - a^2\\text{Var}(Y)\n$$\nSince covariance is symmetric, $\\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \\text{Cov}(Y, X)$, the two middle terms cancel each other out:\n$$\n\\text{Cov}(U, V) = \\text{Var}(X) - a\\text{Cov}(X, Y) + a\\text{Cov}(X, Y) - a^2\\text{Var}(Y)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Cov}(U, V) = \\text{Var}(X) - a^2\\text{Var}(Y)\n$$\nAn important observation is that this expression for $\\text{Cov}(U, V)$ does not depend on $\\text{Cov}(X, Y)$, and therefore does not depend on the correlation coefficient $\\rho_{XY}$. The given value $\\rho_{XY} = 0.60$ is extraneous information for this specific transformation.\n\nTo achieve independence, we set the covariance to zero:\n$$\n\\text{Var}(X) - a^2\\text{Var}(Y) = 0\n$$\nNow we can solve for $a^2$:\n$$\na^2 = \\frac{\\text{Var}(X)}{\\text{Var}(Y)}\n$$\nThe problem provides the values for the variances: $\\text{Var}(X) = 16.0 \\text{ V}^2$ and $\\text{Var}(Y) = 9.0 \\text{ V}^2$.
