The Delta method is a fundamental tool for this purpose, using a linear approximation to translate convergence results. This exercise asks you to apply the Delta method to find the asymptotic distribution of the sample odds ratio, a common measure in many scientific fields [@problem_id:1910243].", "problem": "Let $X_1, X_2, \\dots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables drawn from a Bernoulli distribution with a parameter $p$ representing the probability of success, where $0  p  1$.

We can find this using the Delta method.\n\nFirst, we establish the limiting distribution of the sample proportion, $\\hat{p}_n$. The random variables $X_i$ are i.i.d. Bernoulli($p$). The mean and variance of each $X_i$ are:\n$E[X_i] = \\mu = p$\n$Var(X_i) = \\sigma^2 = p(1-p)$\n\nThe sample proportion $\\hat{p}_n$ is the sample mean of these variables. According to the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), for a large sample size $n$, the distribution of the sample mean is approximately normal. More formally, the CLT states:\n$$\n\\sqrt{n}(\\hat{p}_n - p) \\xrightarrow{d} N(0, p(1-p))\n$$\nwhere $\\xrightarrow{d}$ denotes convergence in distribution. This tells us that the random variable $\\sqrt{n}(\\hat{p}_n - p)$ converges to a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a variance of $p(1-p)$.\n\nNext, we apply the Delta method. The Delta method provides a way to find the limiting distribution of a function of a random variable whose limiting distribution is known. Our statistic of interest, $O_n$, is a function of $\\hat{p}_n$. Let's define this function as $g(x) = \\frac{x}{1-x}$. Then, $O_n = g(\\hat{p}_n)$.\n\nThe Delta method states that if $\\sqrt{n}(Y_n - \\mu) \\xrightarrow{d} N(0, \\sigma^2)$, then for a differentiable function $g$ such that $g'(\\mu) \\neq 0$:\n$$\n\\sqrt{n}(g(Y_n) - g(\\mu)) \\xrightarrow{d} N(0, [g'(\\mu)]^2 \\sigma^2)\n$$\n\nIn our case, $Y_n = \\hat{p}_n$, $\\mu = p$, and $\\sigma^2 = p(1-p)$. We need to find the derivative of our function $g(x)$.
