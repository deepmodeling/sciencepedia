Since $y(0) = 3 \\in (2,5)$, the solution initially lies in this interval and increases. The point $y = 5$ is an equilibrium, so $y(t)$ cannot cross it; if it reaches $y = 5$ at some time, uniqueness implies it remains there. Consequently, $y(t)$ is bounded above by $5$ and is monotonically increasing, so by the monotone convergence principle, the limit\n$$\nL = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} y(t)\n$$\nexists and satisfies $L \\leq 5$.\n\nBecause $f$ is continuous, any limit $L$ of a solution to an autonomous equation must satisfy $f(L) = 0$, hence $L \\in \\{2,5\\}$.
