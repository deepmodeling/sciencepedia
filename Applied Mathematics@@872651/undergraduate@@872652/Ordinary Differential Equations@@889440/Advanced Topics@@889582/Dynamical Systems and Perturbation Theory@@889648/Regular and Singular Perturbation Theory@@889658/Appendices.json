Such problems are typically of the form $\\epsilon y'' + p(x) y' + q(x) y = f(x)$.\n\nFor the given equation, $\\epsilon y'' + (x^2 - x) y' + y = 0$, we can identify the coefficients:\n$p(x) = x^2 - x$\n$q(x) = 1$\n$f(x) = 0$\n\nThe location of a boundary layer in a linear singular perturbation problem is determined by the sign of the coefficient of the first derivative, $p(x)$, over the domain of interest. The boundary layer serves to connect the \"outer solution\" (the approximate solution away from the layer) to the boundary condition that the outer solution cannot satisfy.\n\nThe outer solution, let's call it $y_0(x)$, is found by setting $\\epsilon = 0$ in the original equation. This reduces the second-order ODE to a first-order ODE:\n$$\np(x) y_0' + q(x) y_0 = 0\n$$\n$$\n(x^2 - x) y_0' + y_0 = 0\n$$\n\nThe characteristics of this first-order equation determine which boundary condition is propagated into the domain. The direction of information flow is related to the sign of $p(x)$. The general rule is as follows:\n- If $p(x)  0$ over the interval, the boundary layer is located at the left endpoint.\n- If $p(x)  0$ over the interval, the boundary layer is located at the right endpoint.\n- If $p(x)$ changes sign within the interval, a more complex analysis involving internal layers (or turning points) is required.\n\nLet's analyze the sign of $p(x) = x^2 - x$ on the specified domain $x \\in [0, 1]$. We can factor the expression:\n$$\np(x) = x(x-1)\n$$\nWe are interested in the sign of $p(x)$ in the interior of the domain, i.e., for $x \\in (0, 1)$.\nFor any $x$ in this open interval:\n- The term $x$ is positive.\n- The term $(x-1)$ is negative.\n\nTherefore, the product $p(x) = x(x-1)$ is negative for all $x \\in (0, 1)$. The fact that $p(x)=0$ at the endpoints $x=0$ and $x=1$ does not change the fact that $p(x)$ is consistently negative throughout the interior of the domain.\n\nSince $p(x)  0$ on the interval $(0,1)$, the boundary layer must be located at the right endpoint of the domain. For the domain $[0,1]$, the right endpoint is $x=1$. The outer solution will be determined by the boundary condition at $x=0$, and the boundary layer at $x=1$ is necessary to satisfy the boundary condition at $x=1$.\n\nThus, the boundary layer is located at $x=1$.
