This is a conservative system, so we can analyze it using the concept of total mechanical energy.\n\nFirst, we identify the force and derive the potential energy. The equation of motion is $\\ddot{x} = x - x^3$. Since Newton's second law is $F = m\\ddot{x}$ and the mass is $m=1$, the force on the particle is $F(x) = x - x^3$.\nThe potential energy $U(x)$ is related to the force by $F(x) = -dU/dx$. We can find $U(x)$ by integrating:\n$$ U(x) = -\\int F(x) \\,dx = -\\int (x - x^3) \\,dx = -\\frac{1}{2}x^2 + \\frac{1}{4}x^4 + C $$\nThe problem states that $U(0) = 0$, so substituting $x=0$ gives $U(0) = 0 + 0 + C = 0$, which implies the constant of integration $C=0$. Thus, the potential energy is:\n$$ U(x) = \\frac{1}{4}x^4 - \\frac{1}{2}x^2 $$\n\nThe total energy $E$ of the system is the sum of kinetic and potential energy, and it is a conserved quantity:\n$$ E = K + U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\dot{x}^2 + \\frac{1}{4}x^4 - \\frac{1}{2}x^2 $$\n\nNext, we find all equilibrium points by setting the force to zero: $F(x) = x - x^3 = x(1-x^2) = 0$. This gives three equilibrium positions: $x=0$, $x=1$, and $x=-1$.\n\nThe problem focuses on the unstable equilibrium at the origin, $(x, \\dot{x}) = (0, 0)$. The energy at this point, $E_{crit}$, is:\n$$ E_{crit} = \\frac{1}{2}(0)^2 + \\frac{1}{4}(0)^4 - \\frac{1}{2}(0)^2 = 0 $$\nSo, we need to compare the cases where the energy $E$ is slightly negative versus slightly positive.\n\nTo understand the motion, let's analyze the shape of the potential energy function $U(x)$. The local extrema of $U(x)$ occur at the equilibrium points.\n- At $x=0$, $U(0) = 0$. This is a local maximum of the potential (since the equilibrium is unstable).\n- At $x=\\pm 1$, $U(\\pm 1) = \\frac{1}{4}(\\pm 1)^4 - \\frac{1}{2}(\\pm 1)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{2} = -\\frac{1}{4}$. These are the potential energy minima, corresponding to stable equilibrium points.\nThe potential $U(x)$ has a \"double-well\" shape, with a local maximum (a barrier) at $x=0$ and two symmetric minima (wells) at $x=\\pm 1$.\n\nCase 1: Energy $E_1  E_{crit}$ (i.e., $E_1$ is slightly negative).\nLet $E_1 = -\\epsilon$ where $\\epsilon$ is a small positive number. The total energy is between the minimum potential energy ($-\\frac{1}{4}$) and the energy of the local maximum ($0$). A particle with this energy does not have enough energy to overcome the potential barrier at $x=0$.\nIf the particle starts in the well around $x=1$, it will be trapped there, oscillating between two turning points, both with $x0$. If it starts in the well around $x=-1$, it will be trapped and oscillate in the $x0$ region.\nIn the $(x, \\dot{x})$ plane, this periodic motion corresponds to a closed loop (an orbit). Since the motion is confined to either the left or the right side of the origin, the trajectory will be one of two possible closed loops: one located in the right half-plane ($x0$) enclosing the stable equilibrium point $(1, 0)$, or one in the left half-plane ($x0$) enclosing $(-1, 0)$.\n\nCase 2: Energy $E_2  E_{crit}$ (i.e., $E_2$ is slightly positive).\nLet $E_2 = +\\epsilon$ where $\\epsilon$ is a small positive number. This energy is greater than the potential energy at the barrier at $x=0$. Therefore, the particle can travel between the two potential wells.\nThe particle will move back and forth between two turning points, one at $-x_{max}$ and one at $+x_{max}$, and it will pass through the origin. The motion is still periodic.\nIn the $(x, \\dot{x})$ plane, this motion corresponds to a single, larger closed loop that encircles all three equilibrium points: $(-1, 0)$, $(0, 0)$, and $(1, 0)$.\n\nComparing these findings with the given options:\n- A is incorrect because the trajectory for $E_1$ is bounded (a closed loop).\n- B correctly describes the two scenarios: for $E_10$, there are two possible disconnected loops, one for $x0$ and one for $x0$; for $E_20$, there is a single loop that encloses all three equilibrium points.\n- C incorrectly reverses the descriptions for the two cases.\n- D is incorrect because the system is conservative (no friction or damping), so trajectories cannot spiral inwards. They are closed orbits.\n- E incorrectly reverses the descriptions and falsely claims the trajectory for $E_2$ is unbounded. It is a larger, but still bounded, closed orbit.\n\nTherefore, the correct statement is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2170515"}]}
