We need to find the smallest positive eigenvalue $\\lambda$ and its corresponding eigenfunction $y(x)$.\n\nThe general solution to the differential equation depends on the sign of the eigenvalue $\\lambda$. We analyze three cases.\n\n**Case 1: $\\lambda  0$**\nLet $\\lambda = -k^2$ for some real number $k  0$. The differential equation becomes $y''(x) - k^2 y(x) = 0$. The general solution to this equation is:\n$$\ny(x) = A \\cosh(kx) + B \\sinh(kx)\n$$\nWe apply the first boundary condition, $y(0) = 0$:\n$$\ny(0) = A \\cosh(0) + B \\sinh(0) = A(1) + B(0) = A = 0\n$$\nSo, the solution simplifies to $y(x) = B \\sinh(kx)$.\nNext, we apply the second boundary condition, $y'(\\pi/2) = 0$. First, we find the derivative of $y(x)$:\n$$\ny'(x) = B k \\cosh(kx)\n$$\nNow, we evaluate it at $x=\\pi/2$:\n$$\ny'(\\pi/2) = B k \\cosh(k\\pi/2) = 0\n$$\nFor a non-trivial solution, we require $B \\neq 0$. Since we assumed $k  0$, both $k$ and $\\cosh(k\\pi/2)$ are strictly positive (as $\\cosh(z) \\ge 1$ for all real $z$). Therefore, the only way for this equation to hold is if $B=0$. This leads to the trivial solution $y(x)=0$. Thus, there are no negative eigenvalues.\n\n**Case 2: $\\lambda = 0$**\nThe differential equation becomes $y''(x) = 0$. Integrating twice gives the general solution:\n$$\ny(x) = Ax + B\n$$\nApply the first boundary condition, $y(0)=0$:\n$$\ny(0) = A(0) + B = B = 0\n$$\nThe solution reduces to $y(x) = Ax$.\nNow, apply the second boundary condition, $y'(\\pi/2)=0$. The derivative is $y'(x) = A$.\n$$\ny'(\\pi/2) = A = 0\n$$\nThis implies $A=0$, which again leads to the trivial solution $y(x)=0$. So, $\\lambda=0$ is not an eigenvalue.\n\n**Case 3: $\\lambda  0$**\nLet $\\lambda = k^2$ for some real number $k  0$. The differential equation is $y''(x) + k^2 y(x) = 0$. The general solution is:\n$$\ny(x) = A \\cos(kx) + B \\sin(kx)\n$$\nApply the first boundary condition, $y(0)=0$:\n$$\ny(0) = A \\cos(0) + B \\sin(0) = A(1) + B(0) = A = 0\n$$\nThe solution simplifies to $y(x) = B \\sin(kx)$. For the simplest non-trivial form, we can set the arbitrary constant $B=1$. So, we consider eigenfunctions of the form $y(x) = \\sin(kx)$.\nNow, apply the second boundary condition, $y'(\\pi/2)=0$.
