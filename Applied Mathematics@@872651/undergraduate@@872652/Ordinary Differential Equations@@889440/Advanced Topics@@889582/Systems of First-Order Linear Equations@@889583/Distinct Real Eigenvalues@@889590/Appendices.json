This practice reverses the typical problem-solving process: instead of finding eigenvalues from a matrix, you will construct the system's matrix $A$ from a given set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

The relationship between a matrix $A$, its eigenvalue $\\lambda$, and the corresponding eigenvector $\\vec{v}$ is given by the equation $A\\vec{v} = \\lambda\\vec{v}$.\n\nWe can use the concept of matrix diagonalization to find $A$. If a matrix $A$ has a set of linearly independent eigenvectors, it can be expressed as $A = PDP^{-1}$, where:\n- $P$ is the matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of $A$.\n- $D$ is the diagonal matrix with the corresponding eigenvalues on the diagonal.\n- $P^{-1}$ is the inverse of matrix $P$.\n\nFirst, we must correctly associate the given eigenvalues with the given eigenvector directions. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda = -1$ and $\\lambda = -3$.\nThe absolute magnitudes are $|\\lambda_1| = |-1| = 1$ and $|\\lambda_2| = |-3| = 3$.\nThe eigenvalue with the smaller absolute magnitude is $\\lambda_1 = -1$. The problem states its corresponding eigenvector is parallel to $\\vec{v}_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe eigenvalue with the larger absolute magnitude is $\\lambda_2 = -3$. The problem states its corresponding eigenvector is parallel to $\\vec{v}_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nSince the origin is a nodal sink, we must have two distinct, real, negative eigenvalues. Our given eigenvalues $\\lambda_1 = -1$ and $\\lambda_2 = -3$ satisfy this condition.\n\nNow, we construct the matrices $P$ and $D$. The order of the columns in $P$ must match the order of the eigenvalues in $D$.\nLet's set the first column of $P$ to be $\\vec{v}_1$ and the second column to be $\\vec{v}_2$.\n$$P = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1 \\\\ 1  -1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe corresponding diagonal matrix of eigenvalues $D$ will have $\\lambda_1$ in the first diagonal entry and $\\lambda_2$ in the second.\n$$D = \\begin{pmatrix} -1  0 \\\\ 0  -3 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nNext, we need to find the inverse of $P$. For a general $2 \\times 2$ matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} a  b \\\\ c  d \\end{pmatrix}$, the inverse is given by the formula $\\frac{1}{ad-bc}\\begin{pmatrix} d  -b \\\\ -c  a \\end{pmatrix}$.\nFor our matrix $P$, $a=1, b=1, c=1, d=-1$. The determinant is $\\det(P) = (1)(-1) - (1)(1) = -2$.\nThe inverse is:\n$$P^{-1} = \\frac{1}{-2}\\begin{pmatrix} -1  -1 \\\\ -1  1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2}  \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \\frac{1}{2}  -\\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nFinally, we compute $A = PDP^{-1}$. We can first compute the product $PD$.\n$$PD = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1 \\\\ 1  -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1  0 \\\\ 0  -3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} (1)(-1)+(1)(0)  (1)(0)+(1)(-3) \\\\ (1)(-1)+(-1)(0)  (1)(0)+(-1)(-3) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1  -3 \\\\ -1  3 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\nNow we multiply this result by $P^{-1}$:\n$$A = (PD)P^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1  -3 \\\\ -1  3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2}  \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \\frac{1}{2}  -\\frac{1}{2} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nPerforming the matrix multiplication:\n$$A = \\begin{pmatrix} (-1)(\\frac{1}{2}) + (-3)(\\frac{1}{2})  (-1)(\\frac{1}{2}) + (-3)(-\\frac{1}{2}) \\\\ (-1)(\\frac{1}{2}) + (3)(\\frac{1}{2})  (-1)(\\frac{1}{2}) + (3)(-\\frac{1}{2}) \\end{pmatrix}$$\n$$A = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{3}{2}  -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{3}{2} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{3}{2}  -\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{3}{2} \\end{pmatrix}$$\n$$A = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{4}{2}  \\frac{2}{2} \\\\ \\frac{2}{2}  -\\frac{4}{2} \\end{pmatrix}$$\n$$A = \\begin{pmatrix} -2  1 \\\\ 1  -2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThus, the required matrix is $A = \\begin{pmatrix} -2  1 \\\\ 1  -2 \\end{pmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -2  1 \\\\ 1  -2 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2169961"}, {"introduction": "The behavior of a dynamical system can change dramatically with small adjustments to its underlying parameters.
