For $t  1$, $t^{10}  t^2$. If the integral for $\\mathcal{L}\\{t^{10}\\}$ converges for a specific value of $s$, it means the exponential decay $e^{-st}$ is strong enough to dominate the growth of $t^{10}$. Since $t^2$ grows more slowly than $t^{10}$, the same exponential decay must also be sufficient to make the integral for $\\mathcal{L}\\{t^2\\}$ converge. Therefore, any $s$ in $R_{10}$ must also be in $R_2$, implying $R_{10}$ is a subset of $R_2$.\n\nB. For $0  t  1$, we have $t^{10}  t^2$. Since the function $t^{10}$ is smaller than $t^2$ near the origin, its integral is easier to converge. This means that the region of convergence for $\\mathcal{L}\\{t^{10}\\}$ must be larger than that for $\\mathcal{L}\\{t^2\\}$, so $R_2$ is a subset of $R_{10}$.\n\nC. The Laplace transform is a linear operator. Since $t^{10}$ and $t^2$ are both simple power functions (polynomials), the structure of the transform requires that their regions of convergence must be identical. Therefore, $R_2 = R_{10}$.\n\nD. The convergence of the integral is determined by the behavior of the integrand near $t=0$. Since both $t^2$ and $t^{10}$ are zero at $t=0$, their integrands behave similarly near the lower limit of integration, implying that their regions of convergence are the same, so $R_2 = R_{10}$.\n\nE. The Laplace transform of a derivative is related to the transform of the original function by $\\mathcal{L}\\{f'(t)\\} = s\\mathcal{L}\\{f(t)\\} - f(0)$.
