This is found by analyzing the homogeneous version of the equation:\n$$4y'' + 100y = 0$$\nDividing by 4, we get:\n$$y'' + 25y = 0$$\nThis is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator. The standard form is $y'' + \\omega_0^2 y = 0$. By comparing the two equations, we can identify $\\omega_0^2 = 25$. Taking the positive root, the natural angular frequency is:\n$$\\omega_0 = \\sqrt{25} = 5 \\text{ rad/s}$$\n\nThe problem describes a phenomenon where the amplitude of oscillation varies periodically. This is characteristic of beats, which occur when the forcing frequency $\\omega$ is close to the natural frequency $\\omega_0$. The general solution to the non-homogeneous equation is the sum of the complementary solution $y_c(t)$ and a particular solution $y_p(t)$.\n\nThe complementary solution is the general solution to the homogeneous equation:\n$$y_c(t) = C_1 \\cos(\\omega_0 t) + C_2 \\sin(\\omega_0 t) = C_1 \\cos(5t) + C_2 \\sin(5t)$$\n\nTo find a particular solution, we can use the method of undetermined coefficients. Since $\\omega \\neq \\omega_0$, we assume a particular solution of the form:\n$$y_p(t) = A \\cos(\\omega t) + B \\sin(\\omega t)$$\nSince the forcing term only contains a cosine, we can simplify the guess to $y_p(t) = A \\cos(\\omega t)$.\nThe derivatives are:\n$$y_p'(t) = -A\\omega \\sin(\\omega t)$$\n$$y_p''(t) = -A\\omega^2 \\cos(\\omega t)$$\nSubstituting these into the original differential equation:\n$$4(-A\\omega^2 \\cos(\\omega t)) + 100(A \\cos(\\omega t)) = \\cos(\\omega t)$$\nFactoring out $\\cos(\\omega t)$:\n$$A(-4\\omega^2 + 100) \\cos(\\omega t) = \\cos(\\omega t)$$\nThis implies that $A(-4\\omega^2 + 100) = 1$, so:\n$$A = \\frac{1}{100 - 4\\omega^2} = \\frac{1}{4(25 - \\omega^2)}$$\nThe particular solution is:\n$$y_p(t) = \\frac{\\cos(\\omega t)}{4(25 - \\omega^2)}$$\n\nThe general solution is $y(t) = y_c(t) + y_p(t)$.
