{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "Determining the order of a differential equation often seems as simple as spotting the highest derivative. However, equations can be written in a compact form where the full structure is not immediately obvious. This first exercise [@problem_id:2189608] demonstrates the importance of \"unpacking\" an equation by applying fundamental calculus rules, like the product rule, to correctly identify its order.", "problem": "Consider the following ordinary differential equation in which $y$ is a function of the independent variable $x$, and $y'$ denotes the first derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}(x^2 y') + y = 0\n$$\nTo properly classify a differential equation, it must first be written in its fully expanded form, where all indicated differentiations have been performed. Determine the order of this differential equation.", "solution": "We are given the differential equation\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(x^{2}y'\\right)+y=0.\n$$\nTo determine the order, we first expand the derivative using the product rule. The product rule states that for functions $u(x)$ and $v(x)$, $\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(u v\\right)=u'v+u v'$. Here, take $u(x)=x^{2}$ and $v(x)=y'$, so $u'(x)=2x$ and $v'(x)=y''$. Therefore,\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(x^{2}y'\\right)=(x^{2})'y'+x^{2}y''=2x\\,y'+x^{2}y''.\n$$\nSubstituting this into the original equation gives the fully expanded form\n$$\nx^{2}y''+2x\\,y'+y=0.\n$$\nThe order of a differential equation is the highest order of derivative of the dependent variable that appears in the equation. In this expanded form, the highest derivative is $y''$, which is of second order. Therefore, the order of the differential equation is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2189608"}, {"introduction": "Physical models often include non-linear terms to describe phenomena like friction or resistance, which can look intimidating. A common point of confusion is whether these complex terms, such as absolute values, affect the order of the differential equation. This practice [@problem_id:2189592] clarifies this critical concept, showing that the order is a structural property determined solely by the highest derivative present, regardless of the equation's linearity or the smoothness of its terms.", "problem": "Consider the following ordinary differential equation, which can be used to model a physical system with a damping force proportional to the magnitude of its velocity but always opposing the motion:\n$$y''(t) + \\alpha |y'(t)| + \\beta y(t) = 0$$\nwhere $y(t)$ is the displacement of the system at time $t$, and $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are positive real constants.

The order is undefined because the equation is non-linear.\n\nE. The order is undefined because the absolute value function $|y'(t)|$ is not differentiable everywhere.", "solution": "We recall the definition: the order of an ordinary differential equation is the highest order of derivative of the unknown function that appears in the equation.\n\nConsider the given equation:\n$$y''(t) + \\alpha |y'(t)| + \\beta y(t) = 0.$$\nThe derivatives present are $y''(t)$ (second derivative), $y'(t)$ (first derivative), and $y(t)$ (zeroth derivative). The highest derivative that appears is $y''(t)$, which is of order two.\n\nNonlinearity, such as the presence of $|y'(t)|$, does not affect the definition of order. Similarly, the fact that $|y'(t)|$ is not differentiable with respect to $y'$ at $y'=0$ does not change the order of the differential equation; it only affects smoothness and certain analytical properties, not the order. Therefore, the order is determined solely by the highest derivative present, which is two.\n\nHence, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2189592"}, {"introduction": "The order of a differential equation is not just a feature of the equation itself; it is deeply connected to the structure of its solutions. This final practice shifts our perspective by asking us to deduce the order by examining the general solution. It highlights a fundamental theorem of linear ODEs: the order is equal to the number of arbitrary constants, which corresponds to the number of linearly independent functions that form the solution space [@problem_id:2189602].", "problem": "A theoretical model for a mechanical system is described by a linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation with real, continuous coefficients on the domain $x  0$.
