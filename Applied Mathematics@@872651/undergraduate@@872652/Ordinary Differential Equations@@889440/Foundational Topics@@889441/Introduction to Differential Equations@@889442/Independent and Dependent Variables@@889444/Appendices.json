This exercise focuses on a classic model for the spread of information, asking you to parse the description to determine which quantity is the independent variable, which is the dependent variable, and which are simply parameters. Mastering this distinction is crucial for setting up and interpreting mathematical models correctly [@problem_id:2179670].", "problem": "A sociologist is modeling the spread of a viral news story within a large, isolated online community of fixed size $N$. Let $P(t)$ represent the number of individuals in the community who have seen the story at a given time $t$, where $t$ is measured in hours from the story's initial release. The sociologist proposes that the rate at which the number of informed individuals changes is directly proportional to the product of the number of people who have seen the story and the number of people who have not yet seen it. The constant of proportionality, which reflects the story's virality, is denoted by $k$. This relationship is described by the following ordinary differential equation:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = k P (N - P)\n$$\n\nBased on this mathematical model, identify the correct classification of its components.\n\nA.

Since the derivative is $\\frac{dP}{dt}$, the differentiation is with respect to $t$, so the independent variable is $t$.\n\nThe dependent variable is the function whose value changes in response to the independent variable. Here $P$ depends on $t$, written $P(t)$, so the dependent variable is $P$.\n\nParameters $N$ and $k$ are constants in this model; $N$ is the fixed population size and $k$ is the constant of proportionality. Therefore, neither $N$ nor $k$ is a dependent variable.\n\nThe order of a differential equation is the highest order of derivative present. The equation contains only the first derivative $\\frac{dP}{dt}$ and no higher derivatives, so it is a first-order equation.\n\nBecause the equation involves derivatives with respect to a single independent variable $t$ and no partial derivatives, it is an ordinary differential equation.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because it swaps the roles of dependent and independent variables.\n- B is incorrect because the equation is not second-order.\n- C is incorrect because $N$ is a constant parameter, not a dependent variable.\n- D is correct: independent variable $t$, dependent variable $P$, first-order ordinary differential equation.\n- E is incorrect because $k$ is a constant parameter and the equation is not second-order.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2179670"}, {"introduction": "Differential equations are a powerful tool for describing the geometry of curves. This practice challenges you to translate a specific geometric property—that a curve's normal line at any point passes through the origin—into a formal differential equation.

The slope of the tangent is $m_{t} = \\frac{dy}{dx}$, so the slope of the normal is $m_{n} = -\\frac{1}{m_{t}}$ (when $m_{t} \\neq 0$). Because the normal at $(x,y)$ passes through the origin, its slope equals the slope of the line from $(0,0)$ to $(x,y)$, namely $\\frac{y}{x}$.

In this problem, you will act as a physicist, combining the principles of hydrostatic equilibrium and the ideal gas law to build a realistic model of atmospheric pressure as a function of altitude. This practice showcases how to synthesize multiple physical relationships into a single, solvable ODE to predict the behavior of a natural system [@problem_id:2179662].", "problem": "A simplified model for atmospheric pressure on a planet is based on two principles: hydrostatic equilibrium and the ideal gas law. Hydrostatic equilibrium implies that the rate of change of pressure, $P$, with respect to altitude, $h$, is given by $\\frac{dP}{dh} = -\\rho(h)g$, where $\\rho(h)$ is the density of the atmospheric gas at altitude $h$ and $g$ is the constant acceleration due to gravity on the planet.

Instead, it is observed to decrease linearly with altitude according to the relation $T(h) = T_0 - \\alpha h$. Here, $T_0$ is the absolute temperature at the surface ($h=0$) and $\\alpha$ is a positive constant known as the temperature lapse rate. The pressure at the surface is measured to be $P_0$.\n\nBy combining these physical relations, you can construct a first-order Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) that governs the pressure $P$ as a function of altitude $h$. First, identify the independent and dependent variables. Then, solve this ODE with the given surface condition to find an expression for the pressure at any altitude $h$ within the region where this temperature model is valid.\n\nYour final answer should be an expression for $P(h)$ in terms of the given parameters: $P_0, M, g, R, T_0, h$, and $\\alpha$.", "solution": "The independent variable is altitude $h$ and the dependent variable is the pressure $P(h)$.
