In the absence of control measures, the pest population, $N(t)$, is assumed to grow exponentially with a net intrinsic rate $r$. The control measure involves releasing sterile males which mate with fertile females, effectively removing them from the reproductive pool. The rate of this removal is a function of the pest population density itself. At very low densities, encounters between sterile and fertile insects are rare. As the population grows, the removal rate increases, but it eventually saturates at a maximum rate due to the finite number of sterile insects available. This saturation effect is well-described by a Holling type III functional response.\n\nThe full population dynamics are thus given by the ordinary differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dN}{dt} = rN - \\frac{H N^2}{A^2 + N^2} $$\nHere, $H$ is the maximum removal rate parameter, and $A$ is the pest population density at which the removal rate reaches half of its maximum effectiveness.
