An object falling through a fluid reaches terminal velocity when the upward drag force perfectly balances the downward force of gravity. This practice [@problem_id:2204366] challenges you to explore how this equilibrium speed depends on the object's mass under two different, widely used models for air resistance: one where drag is proportional to velocity ($F_{drag} \\propto v$) and another where it's proportional to the square of velocity ($F_{drag} \\propto v^2$). By comparing these two scenarios, you will gain a deeper intuition for the crucial role that physical modeling plays in predicting motion.", "problem": "An engineering team is developing a small, spherical instrument package for release into a planetary atmosphere.
