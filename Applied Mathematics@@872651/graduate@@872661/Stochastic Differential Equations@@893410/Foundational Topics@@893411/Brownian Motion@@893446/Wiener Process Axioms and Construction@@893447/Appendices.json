Your final answer must be a single closed-form analytic expression for the conditional law of $W_{t}$ given $W_{s}$.", "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed sound, well-posed, and based on established principles of stochastic processes. We may proceed with the derivation.\n\nOur objective is to determine the conditional distribution of the random variable $W_{t}$ given the value of the random variable $W_{s}$, for a standard Wiener process $W$ and times $0 \\le s  t$. This is denoted as the law of $W_{t} | W_{s}$.\n\nWe begin by expressing the random variable $W_{t}$ in terms of $W_{s}$ and an increment. For any $s  t$, we can write the identity:\n$$\nW_{t} = W_{s} + (W_{t} - W_{s})\n$$\nWhen we condition on $W_{s}$, the value of $W_{s}$ is considered known. Therefore, the conditional distribution of $W_{t}$ is determined by the distribution of the increment $W_{t} - W_{s}$ and its relationship with $W_{s}$.\n\nThe cornerstone of this derivation lies in establishing the independence of the increment $W_{t} - W_{s}$ from the sigma-algebra $\\mathcal{F}_{s} = \\sigma(W_{u} : 0 \\le u \\le s)$. The random variable $W_{s}$ is, by definition, measurable with respect to $\\mathcal{F}_{s}$. Thus, showing that $W_{t} - W_{s}$ is independent of $\\mathcal{F}_{s}$ will imply that it is independent of $W_{s}$.\n\nAxiom (iii) states that for any $0 \\le r  s  t$, the increment $W_{t} - W_{s}$ is independent of the sigma-algebra $\\mathcal{F}_{r}$. We must extend this to show independence from $\\mathcal{F}_{s}$. Let us define the collection of sets $\\mathcal{A} = \\bigcup_{rs} \\mathcal{F}_{r}$.\n1.  $\\mathcal{A}$ is a $\\pi$-system: If $A_{1} \\in \\mathcal{F}_{r_{1}}$ and $A_{2} \\in \\mathcal{F}_{r_{2}}$ with $r_{1}  s$ and $r_{2}  s$, then $A_{1} \\cap A_{2} \\in \\mathcal{F}_{\\max(r_{1}, r_{2})}$. Since $\\max(r_{1}, r_{2})  s$, it follows that $A_{1} \\cap A_{2} \\in \\mathcal{A}$.\n2.  The sigma-algebra generated by $\\mathcal{A}$ is $\\mathcal{F}_{s}$. This is because $\\sigma(\\mathcal{A}) = \\sigma(\\bigcup_{rs} \\mathcal{F}_{r}) = \\mathcal{F}_{s}$. The latter equality holds for filtrations generated by right-continuous processes like the Wiener process (whose paths are continuous almost surely by Axiom (ii)).\n3.  By Axiom (iii), for any set $A \\in \\mathcal{A}$, there exists an $r  s$ such that $A \\in \\mathcal{F}_{r}$. For this $r$, the increment $W_{t}-W_{s}$ is independent of $A$.\n4.  The collection of all events $B \\in \\mathcal{F}$ for which $W_{t} - W_{s}$ is independent of $B$ forms a $\\lambda$-system. Since this $\\lambda$-system contains the $\\pi$-system $\\mathcal{A}$, an application of Dynkin's $\\pi$-$\\lambda$ theorem allows us to conclude that it also contains $\\sigma(\\mathcal{A}) = \\mathcal{F}_{s}$.\n\nTherefore, the increment $W_{t} - W_{s}$ is independent of the sigma-algebra $\\mathcal{F}_{s}$, and consequently, it is independent of the random variable $W_{s}$.\n\nWith independence established, we can formally derive the conditional law using characteristic functions. Let $\\phi_{X}(k) = \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(ikX)]$ denote the characteristic function of a random variable $X$. We seek the conditional characteristic function of $W_{t}$ given $W_{s}=w_{s}$, denoted $\\phi_{W_{t}|W_{s}}(k|w_{s})$:\n$$\n\\phi_{W_{t}|W_{s}}(k|w_{s}) = \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(ikW_{t}) | W_{s}=w_{s}]\n$$\nSubstitute the decomposition $W_{t} = W_{s} + (W_{t}-W_{s})$:\n$$\n\\phi_{W_{t}|W_{s}}(k|w_{s}) = \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(ik(W_{s} + (W_{t}-W_{s}))) | W_{s}=w_{s}] = \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(ikW_{s})\\exp(ik(W_{t}-W_{s})) | W_{s}=w_{s}]\n$$\nBy the properties of conditional expectation, since we are conditioning on $W_{s}=w_{s}$, the term $\\exp(ikW_{s})$ becomes the constant $\\exp(ikw_{s})$ and can be factored out:\n$$\n\\phi_{W_{t}|W_{s}}(k|w_{s}) = \\exp(ikw_{s}) \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(ik(W_{t}-W_{s})) | W_{s}=w_{s}]\n$$\nBecause the increment $W_{t}-W_{s}$ is independent of $W_{s}$, the conditional expectation is equal to the unconditional expectation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\exp(ik(W_{t}-W_{s})) | W_{s}=w_{s}] = \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(ik(W_{t}-W_{s}))]\n$$\nThis term is simply the characteristic function of the random variable $W_{t}-W_{s}$. According to Axiom (iv), for $s  t$, the increment $W_{t}-W_{s}$ follows a Gaussian (Normal) distribution with mean $0$ and variance $t-s$, i.e., $W_{t}-W_{s} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, t-s)$.\n\nThe characteristic function of a general Gaussian random variable $X \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^{2})$ is given by $\\phi_{X}(k) = \\exp(ik\\mu - \\frac{1}{2}k^{2}\\sigma^{2})$. For the increment $W_{t}-W_{s}$, we have $\\mu=0$ and $\\sigma^{2}=t-s$. Thus, its characteristic function is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\exp(ik(W_{t}-W_{s}))] = \\exp\\left(ik(0) - \\frac{1}{2}k^{2}(t-s)\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}k^{2}(t-s)\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into our expression for the conditional characteristic function of $W_{t}$:\n$$\n\\phi_{W_{t}|W_{s}}(k|w_{s}) = \\exp(ikw_{s}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}k^{2}(t-s)\\right) = \\exp\\left(ikw_{s} - \\frac{1}{2}k^{2}(t-s)\\right)\n$$\nWe now identify this resulting function. It has the form $\\exp(ik\\mu_{cond} - \\frac{1}{2}k^{2}\\sigma_{cond}^{2})$, which is the characteristic function of a Gaussian distribution. By comparing terms, we find the parameters of this conditional distribution:\n-   The conditional mean is $\\mu_{cond} = w_{s}$.\n-   The conditional variance is $\\sigma_{cond}^{2} = t-s$.\n\nThis shows that the distribution of $W_{t}$ conditional on $W_{s}=w_{s}$ is a normal distribution with mean $w_{s}$ and variance $t-s$. Expressed in terms of the random variable $W_{s}$, the conditional law of $W_{t}$ given $W_{s}$ is a normal distribution with mean $W_{s}$ and variance $t-s$.
