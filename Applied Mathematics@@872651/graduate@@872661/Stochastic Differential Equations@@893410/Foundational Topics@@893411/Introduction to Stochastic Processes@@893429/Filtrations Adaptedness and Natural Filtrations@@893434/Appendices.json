This is equivalent to showing that the generators of $\\mathcal{F}_2$, namely $X_1$ and $X_2$, are $\\mathcal{G}_2$-measurable.\nLet's consider the information available in $\\mathcal{G}_2$, which is the vector $(\\text{sgn}(S_1), \\text{sgn}(S_2))$.\nNote that $S_1 = X_1$. Since $X_1$ can only be $1$ or $-1$, $S_1$ is never zero. Therefore, $\\text{sgn}(S_1) = S_1 = X_1$. This means $X_1$ is $\\sigma(\\text{sgn}(S_1))$-measurable, and since $\\sigma(\\text{sgn}(S_1)) \\subseteq \\mathcal{G}_2$, $X_1$ is $\\mathcal{G}_2$-measurable.\n\nNow let's examine the possible outcomes for $(X_1, X_2)$ and the corresponding values of $(\\text{sgn}(S_1), \\text{sgn}(S_2))$:\n1.

This means that observing the sign vector is equivalent to knowing the exact path. For instance, if we observe the sign vector $(1, 0)$, we know with certainty that the path was $(1, -1)$, so $X_1=1$ and $X_2=-1$.\nSince $(X_1, X_2)$ can be determined from $(\\text{sgn}(S_1), \\text{sgn}(S_2))$, both $X_1$ and $X_2$ are $\\mathcal{G}_2$-measurable.

The atoms of $\\mathcal{G}_3$ are sets of paths that produce the same sign sequence $(\\text{sgn}(S_1), \\text{sgn}(S_2), \\text{sgn}(S_3))$. If we can find two distinct paths that generate the same sign sequence, then $\\mathcal{F}_3$ is strictly finer than $\\mathcal{G}_3$, and they are not equal.\n\nConsider the following two paths for $(X_1, X_2, X_3)$:\n1.  Path $\\omega_1 = (1, 1, -1)$: $S_1=1, S_2=2, S_3=1$. The sign sequence is $(\\text{sgn}(1), \\text{sgn}(2), \\text{sgn}(1)) = (1, 1, 1)$.\n2.  Path $\\omega_2 = (1, -1, 1)$: $S_1=1, S_2=0, S_3=1$. The sign sequence is $(\\text{sgn}(1), \\text{sgn}(0), \\text{sgn}(1)) = (1, 0, 1)$.\n\nLet's re-examine this.\nPath $\\omega_1 = (1, 1, -1)$ yields $(S_1, S_2, S_3)=(1,2,1)$ and sign sequence $(1,1,1)$.\nPath $\\omega_2 = (1, 1, 1)$ yields $(S_1, S_2, S_3)=(1,2,3)$ and sign sequence $(1,1,1)$.\nPaths $\\omega_1$ and $\\omega_2$ are distinct, so $\\{\\omega_1\\}$ and $\\{\\omega_2\\}$ are distinct atoms in $\\mathcal{F}_3$.

A random variable is measurable with respect to a sigma-algebra if and only if it is constant on every atom of that sigma-algebra.\nLet's use our findings from the analysis of statement II for $n=3$. We identified the atom $A = \\{\\omega \\in \\Omega_3 : (\\text{sgn}(S_1), \\text{sgn}(S_2), \\text{sgn}(S_3))=(1,1,1)\\}$, which contains paths $\\omega_1 = (1, 1, -1)$ and $\\omega_2 = (1, 1, 1)$.\nLet's evaluate the random variable $S_3$ on these two outcomes, which both lie in the same atom of $\\mathcal{G}_3$:\n-   $S_3(\\omega_1) = 1+1-1 = 1$.\n-   $S_3(\\omega_2) = 1+1+1 = 3$.\nSince $S_3$ takes on different values on the atom $A$, it cannot be $\\mathcal{G}_3$-measurable.\nBecause the condition fails for $n=3$, the process $(S_n)$ is not adapted to the filtration $(\\mathcal{G}_n)$.\n**Statement III is FALSE.**\n\n**Statement IV: The process $(M_n)_{n \\geq 1}$ defined by $M_n = S_n^2 - n$ is a martingale with respect to the observer's filtration $(\\mathcal{G}_n)_{n \\geq 1}$.**\n\nFor a process to be a martingale with respect to a filtration, it must first be adapted to that filtration.

This means the filtration is right-continuous and complete. The first jump time is $T_{1}=\\inf\\{t0:\\Delta N_{t}=1\\}$. This is a stopping time with respect to $(\\mathcal{F}_{t})$.\n\n**Adaptedness:**\nA process $X=(X_t)_{t \\ge 0}$ is adapted to the filtration $(\\mathcal{F}_t)_{t \\ge 0}$ if for every $t \\ge 0$, the random variable $X_t$ is $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable.\nFor the process $H_t = \\mathbf{1}_{\\{t=T_1\\}}$, we need to show that $H_t$ is $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable for all $t \\ge 0$.\nThe random variable $H_t$ can only take values $0$ or $1$. It is $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable if and only if the event $\\{H_t=1\\}$ belongs to $\\mathcal{F}_t$.\nThe event $\\{H_t=1\\}$ is precisely the event $\\{T_1=t\\}$.\nBy definition, a random time $T$ is a stopping time if the event $\\{T \\le t\\} \\in \\mathcal{F}_t$ for all $t \\ge 0$.\nFor a right-continuous filtration, which we have by the \"usual conditions\", if $T$ is a stopping time, then the event $\\{T=t\\}$ is also in $\\mathcal{F}_t$ for all $t \\ge 0$. This can be seen by writing $\\{T=t\\} = \\{T \\le t\\} \\setminus \\{T  t\\}$. While $\\{T \\le t\\} \\in \\mathcal{F}_t$ by definition, the right-continuity of the filtration ensures that $\\{T  t\\} \\in \\mathcal{F}_t$ as well.\nSpecifically, $\\{T  t\\} = \\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty \\{T \\le t - 1/n\\}$ for rational $t-1/n  t$. Each set $\\{T \\le t-1/n\\}$ is in $\\mathcal{F}_{t-1/n}$, and thus in $\\mathcal{F}_t$. A countable union of sets in $\\mathcal{F}_t$ is also in $\\mathcal{F}_t$.\nTherefore, $\\{T_1=t\\} \\in \\mathcal{F}_t$ for all $t \\ge 0$. This implies $H_t$ is $\\mathcal{F}_t$-measurable for all $t \\ge 0$. Thus, the process $H$ is adapted.\n\n**Optionality:**\nA process is optional if it is measurable with respect to the optional $\\sigma$-field $\\mathcal{O}$ on $\\mathbb{R}_+ \\times \\Omega$. The optional $\\sigma$-field is the $\\sigma$-field generated by all càdlàg (right-continuous with left limits) adapted processes.\nA fundamental result in the theory of stochastic processes is that for any stopping time $T$, its graph, defined as the set $[[T]] = \\{(t, \\omega) \\in \\mathbb{R}_+ \\times \\Omega : t = T(\\omega)\\}$, is an optional set (i.e., $[[T]] \\in \\mathcal{O}$).\nThe process $H_t = \\mathbf{1}_{\\{t=T_1\\}}$ is the indicator function of the graph of the stopping time $T_1$. That is, $H_t(\\omega) = \\mathbf{1}_{[[T_1]]}(t, \\omega)$. As the indicator function of an optional set, $H$ is an optional process.\n\n**Non-predictability:**\nA process is predictable if it is measurable with respect to the predictable $\\sigma$-field $\\mathcal{P}$ on $\\mathbb{R}_+ \\times \\Omega$. The predictable $\\sigma$-field is generated by all left-continuous adapted processes. A key characterization is that a process $X$ is predictable if and only if $X_t$ is $\\mathcal{F}_{t-}$-measurable for all $t > 0$ (and $X_0$ is $\\mathcal{F}_0$-measurable), where $\\mathcal{F}_{t-} = \\sigma(\\bigcup_{st} \\mathcal{F}_s)$.\nLet's test this for $H_t$. We examine the event $\\{H_t=1\\} = \\{T_1=t\\}$ for some $t > 0$. This event occurs if and only if there are no jumps before time $t$ and a jump occurs exactly at time $t$. This can be written in terms of the Poisson process $N$ as $\\{N_{t-} = 0\\} \\cap \\{N_t = 1\\}$.\nThe information available in the filtration $\\mathcal{F}_{t-}$ is the history of the process strictly before time $t$. So, the event $\\{N_{t-} = 0\\} = \\bigcap_{st} \\{N_s=0\\}$ is $\\mathcal{F}_{t-}$-measurable.\nHowever, the event $\\{N_t=1\\}$ depends on the behavior of the process at time $t$. This information is not contained in $\\mathcal{F}_{t-}$. Given $\\mathcal{F}_{t-}$, and specifically on the set where $\\{N_{t-}=0\\}$, the process has a certain probability of jumping at time $t$, but it is not determined. Thus, $\\{N_t=1\\}$ is not an $\\mathcal{F}_{t-}$-measurable event.\nSince $\\{H_t=1\\}$ is not in $\\mathcal{F}_{t-}$, the process $H$ is not predictable.\nThis aligns with the classification of stopping times. A stopping time $T$ is predictable if it is \"announced\" by a sequence of stopping times $T_n \\uparrow T$ with $T_n  T$. The first jump time of a Poisson process is a classic example of a totally inaccessible stopping time, which is by definition not predictable. A process of the form $\\mathbf{1}_{\\{t=T\\}}$ is predictable if and only if $T$ is a predictable stopping time. Since $T_1$ is not predictable, $H$ is not predictable.\n\n### Part 2: Computation of the Integral\n\nWe are asked to compute $I = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} H_{t} \\, dM_{t}$. The process $M_t$ is given by $M_t = N_t - t$. By the linearity of the stochastic integral, we can write:\n$$ I = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} H_{t} \\, d(N_{t} - t) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} H_{t} \\, dN_{t} - \\int_{0}^{\\infty} H_{t} \\, dt $$\nThe problem specifies that the integral with respect to the finite-variation part should be interpreted as a pathwise Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral. Both $N_t$ and the deterministic process $A_t=t$ are processes of finite variation on any finite time interval. Thus, both integrals on the right-hand side can be computed for each path $\\omega$ as Lebesgue-Stieltjes integrals.\n\nLet's compute the second term first:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} H_{t} \\, dt $$\nFor a fixed sample path $\\omega$, the first jump time $T_1(\\omega)$ is a specific, positive real number. The function $t \\mapsto H_t(\\omega)$ is defined as $H_t(\\omega) = \\mathbf{1}_{\\{t=T_1(\\omega)\\}}$. This function is zero for all $t \\neq T_1(\\omega)$ and is $1$ only at the single point $t=T_1(\\omega)$. The Lebesgue integral of a function that is non-zero only on a set of measure zero (a single point in this case) is zero. Thus, for every $\\omega$:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} H_{t}(\\omega) \\, dt = 0 $$\n\nNow, let's compute the first term:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} H_{t} \\, dN_{t} $$\nThis is a Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral with respect to the sample path of a Poisson process. For a fixed path $\\omega$, $N_t(\\omega)$ is a right-continuous, non-decreasing step function. It starts at $N_0=0$ and its value increases by $1$ at each jump time $T_1(\\omega), T_2(\\omega), \\dots$. The measure $dN_t$ corresponds to a sum of Dirac delta masses of size $1$ located at each jump time. The integral is therefore given by the sum over the jumps:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} H_{t}(\\omega) \\, dN_{t}(\\omega) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} H_{T_k(\\omega)}(\\omega) \\, \\Delta N_{T_k(\\omega)} $$\nwhere $T_k(\\omega)$ is the time of the $k$-th jump and $\\Delta N_{T_k(\\omega)} = N_{T_k(\\omega)}(\\omega) - N_{T_k-}(\\omega)$ is the size of the jump. For a standard Poisson process, all jumps are of size $1$, so $\\Delta N_{T_k(\\omega)} = 1$ for all $k \\ge 1$. The integral becomes:\n$$ \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} H_{T_k(\\omega)}(\\omega) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\mathbf{1}_{\\{T_k(\\omega)=T_1(\\omega)\\}} $$\nThe jump times of a Poisson process are almost surely distinct, $0  T_1(\\omega)  T_2(\\omega)  T_3(\\omega)  \\dots$. Therefore, the condition $T_k(\\omega) = T_1(\\omega)$ is only satisfied for $k=1$. The sum reduces to a single non-zero term:\n$$ \\mathbf{1}_{\\{T_1(\\omega)=T_1(\\omega)\\}} + \\mathbf{1}_{\\{T_2(\\omega)=T_1(\\omega)\\}} + \\mathbf{1}_{\\{T_3(\\omega)=T_1(\\omega)\\}} + \\dots = 1 + 0 + 0 + \\dots = 1 $$\nThis holds for any path $\\omega$ where $T_1$ is finite, which occurs with probability $1$.\n\nCombining the two results, we find the value of the integral $I$:\n$$ I = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} H_{t} \\, dN_{t} - \\int_{0}^{\\infty} H_{t} \\, dt = 1 - 0 = 1 $$\nThe fact that $H_t$ is optional but not predictable is crucial for the theory of such integrals. The integral of an optional process with respect to a martingale with jumps (like $M_t$) is well-defined, and its value is determined by the behavior of the integrand at the jump times of the martingale. Our pathwise calculation is consistent with the general theory of stochastic integration for semimartingales.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2976620"}]}
