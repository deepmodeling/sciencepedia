A stochastic process $\\{X_t\\}_{t \\in T}$ on a compact interval $T \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ (here $T=[0,1]$) has a modification with a.s. continuous sample paths if there exist constants $p>0$, $\\alpha>0$, and $K>0$ such that for all $s,t \\in [0,1]$,\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[|X_t - X_s|^p] \\leq K |t-s|^{1+\\alpha}.\n$$\nFurthermore, this modification has sample paths that are locally Hölder continuous with any exponent $\\gamma \\in (0, \\frac{\\alpha}{p})$.\n\nThe problem provides a centered Gaussian process $\\{X_t\\}_{t \\in [0,1]}$ and specifies a condition on the second moment of its increments:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[|X_t - X_s|^2] \\leq C |t-s|^{2H}\n$$\nfor some constants $C0$ and $H0$.\n\nOur first task is to show that this condition is sufficient for the KCT to hold. To do this, we must relate the given second moment to the $p$-th moment required by the theorem. The key is that $\\{X_t\\}$ is a Gaussian process.\nFor any $s, t \\in [0,1]$, the increment $Y_{s,t} = X_t - X_s$ is a random variable. Since $\\{X_t\\}$ is a Gaussian process, any linear combination of its components is Gaussian. Thus, $Y_{s,t}$ is a Gaussian random variable. As the process is centered, $\\mathbb{E}[X_t] = 0$ for all $t$, which implies that the increment has zero mean:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Y_{s,t}] = \\mathbb{E}[X_t - X_s] = \\mathbb{E}[X_t] - \\mathbb{E}[X_s] = 0 - 0 = 0.\n$$\nThe variance of the increment is $\\sigma_{s,t}^2 = \\mathbb{E}[Y_{s,t}^2] = \\mathbb{E}[|X_t - X_s|^2]$. So, $Y_{s,t} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_{s,t}^2)$.\n\nNow, we compute the $p$-th absolute moment of $Y_{s,t}$ for an arbitrary $p > 0$. Let $Z$ be a standard normal random variable, $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$. We can write $Y_{s,t} = \\sigma_{s,t} Z$. Then,\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[|Y_{s,t}|^p] = \\mathbb{E}[|\\sigma_{s,t} Z|^p] = \\sigma_{s,t}^p \\mathbb{E}[|Z|^p] = (\\mathbb{E}[|X_t - X_s|^2])^{p/2} \\mathbb{E}[|Z|^p].\n$$\nThe quantity $\\mathbb{E}[|Z|^p]$ is a finite constant for any $p0$. Let's denote this constant by $M_p$. It can be expressed in terms of the Gamma function as $M_p = 2^{p/2}\\pi^{-1/2}\\Gamma(\\frac{p+1}{2})$.\nSubstituting the given inequality for the second moment, we obtain a bound for the $p$-th moment:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[|X_t - X_s|^p] \\leq (C|t-s|^{2H})^{p/2} M_p = C^{p/2} M_p |t-s|^{pH}.\n$$\nLet's define a new constant $K_p = C^{p/2} M_p$. The moment inequality becomes:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[|X_t - X_s|^p] \\leq K_p |t-s|^{pH}.\n$$\nTo apply the KCT, we need to find a value of $p0$ such that the exponent $pH$ is strictly greater than $1$. That is, we need to find $p0$ and $\\alpha0$ such that $pH = 1+\\alpha$. This is equivalent to finding a $p0$ such that $pH > 1$.\nSince $H0$ is given, we can always choose such a $p$. For example, we can choose any $p > 1/H$. With such a choice, we set $\\alpha = pH - 1 > 0$. Then the condition of the KCT is satisfied with constants $p$, $\\alpha$, and $K=K_p$.\n\nTherefore, the condition that there exist constants $C0$ and $H0$ such that $\\mathbb{E}[|X_{t} - X_{s}|^{2}] \\leq C |t-s|^{2H}$ is a sufficient condition to ensure the existence of a modification of $\\{X_t\\}$ with almost surely continuous sample paths. This completes the first part of the problem.\n\nNow, for the second part, we must determine the largest Hölder exponent $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{max}}$ guaranteed by this application of the KCT. The theorem guarantees that the sample paths of the modification are Hölder continuous for any exponent $\\gamma$ such that\n$$\n0  \\gamma  \\frac{\\alpha}{p}.\n$$\nSubstituting our expression $\\alpha = pH-1$, we find that the paths are Hölder continuous for any exponent $\\gamma$ satisfying\n$$\n0  \\gamma  \\frac{pH-1}{p} = H - \\frac{1}{p}.\n$$\nThis result is valid for any choice of $p$ such that $p > 1/H$. To find the best possible guarantee on the Hölder exponent, we should maximize the upper bound $H - 1/p$. This is achieved by making $p$ as large as possible. As we let $p \\to \\infty$, the term $1/p \\to 0$, and the upper bound for $\\gamma$ approaches $H$.\n\nThis means that for any $\\gamma_0  H$, we can find a sufficiently large $p$ such that $\\gamma_0  H - 1/p$. Specifically, we need $1/p  H - \\gamma_0$, which is equivalent to $p > 1/(H - \\gamma_0)$. Since $\\gamma_0  H$, $H-\\gamma_0 > 0$, so such a $p$ always exists.\nTherefore, the KCT guarantees that the sample paths are Hölder continuous for *every* exponent $\\gamma$ in the interval $(0, H)$.\n\nThe problem asks for the largest Hölder exponent $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{max}}$ that is guaranteed. This corresponds to the supremum of the set of guaranteed exponents, which is the interval $(0, H)$. The supremum of this set is $H$. The problem specifies that $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{max}} \\in (0,1)$, which is consistent with the typical range for $H$ in many applications (like for fractional Brownian motion), implying that the context is for $H \\in (0,1)$.\n\nThus, the largest Hölder exponent is $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{max}} = H$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{H}$$", "id": "2983270"}, {"introduction": "Building directly on the general method for Gaussian processes, this practice applies the theory to a specific and fundamental example: fractional Brownian motion (fBm).

First, we must derive an upper bound for the $p$-th moment of the increments of a fractional Brownian motion (fBm). Second, we must use this bound in conjunction with the Kolmogorov continuity theorem (KCT) to determine the maximal Hölder exponent guaranteed by this specific analysis.\n\n### Step 1: Derivation of the Moment Bound\n\nLet $\\{B_t^H\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ be a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H \\in (0,1)$. By definition, it is a centered Gaussian process. This means that any linear combination of the random variables $B_t^H$ is a Gaussian random variable.\n\nConsider the increment of the process between times $s$ and $t$, which we denote as $X_{s,t} = B_t^H - B_s^H$. As a linear combination of two random variables from the process, $X_{s,t}$ is itself a Gaussian random variable. Since the process is centered, its mean is zero:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X_{s,t}] = \\mathbb{E}[B_t^H - B_s^H] = \\mathbb{E}[B_t^H] - \\mathbb{E}[B_s^H] = 0 - 0 = 0\n$$\nSo, $X_{s,t}$ is a centered Gaussian random variable. Its distribution is fully characterized by its variance, $\\sigma_{s,t}^2 = \\mathbb{E}[X_{s,t}^2]$. We compute this variance using the given covariance function $\\mathbb{E}[B_u^H B_v^H] = \\frac{1}{2}(u^{2H} + v^{2H} - |u-v|^{2H})$.\n\n$$\n\\sigma_{s,t}^2 = \\mathbb{E}[(B_t^H - B_s^H)^2] = \\mathbb{E}[(B_t^H)^2] - 2\\mathbb{E}[B_t^H B_s^H] + \\mathbb{E}[(B_s^H)^2]\n$$\nThe variance of $B_u^H$ at any time $u$ is found by setting $v=u$ in the covariance function:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[(B_u^H)^2] = \\mathbb{E}[B_u^H B_u^H] = \\frac{1}{2}(u^{2H} + u^{2H} - |u-u|^{2H}) = \\frac{1}{2}(2u^{2H}) = u^{2H}\n$$\nSubstituting this and the covariance term back into the variance expression for the increment:\n$$\n\\sigma_{s,t}^2 = t^{2H} + s^{2H} - 2 \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(t^{2H} + s^{2H} - |t-s|^{2H}) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{s,t}^2 = t^{2H} + s^{2H} - (t^{2H} + s^{2H} - |t-s|^{2H})\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{s,t}^2 = t^{2H} + s^{2H} - t^{2H} - s^{2H} + |t-s|^{2H} = |t-s|^{2H}\n$$\nThus, the increment $B_t^H - B_s^H$ is a centered Gaussian random variable with variance $|t-s|^{2H}$. We can write $B_t^H - B_s^H \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, |t-s|^{2H})$.\nLet $Z$ be a standard normal random variable, $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$. Then we can represent the increment as:\n$$\nB_t^H - B_s^H = |t-s|^H Z\n$$\nWe are asked to find an upper bound for $\\mathbb{E}[|B_t^H - B_s^H|^p]$ where $p$ is an even integer and $p \\ge 2$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[|B_t^H - B_s^H|^p] = \\mathbb{E}[||t-s|^H Z|^p] = |t-s|^{Hp} \\mathbb{E}[|Z|^p]\n$$\nSince $p$ is an even integer, $|Z|^p = Z^p$. We need to compute the $p$-th moment of a standard normal distribution. For an even integer $p$, this is given by the formula for the moments of a Gaussian:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[Z^p] = (p-1)!! = (p-1)(p-3)\\cdots 3 \\cdot 1\n$$\nThis constant depends only on $p$. Let's denote it by $C_p = (p-1)!!$. So, we have an exact expression for the moment:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[|B_t^H - B_s^H|^p] = C_p |t-s|^{Hp}\n$$\nThis serves as the required upper bound $\\mathbb{E}[|B_t^H - B_s^H|^p] \\le C_p |t-s|^{Hp}$, where the inequality is in fact an equality.\n\n### Step 2: Application of the Kolmogorov Continuity Theorem\n\nThe Kolmogorov continuity theorem (one-dimensional version) states that if a stochastic process $\\{X_t\\}$ satisfies the condition\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[|X_t - X_s|^p] \\le K|t-s|^{1+\\delta}\n$$\nfor some constants $p0$, $K0$, $\\delta0$, and for all $s,t$ in a compact interval, then there exists a modification of the process which is almost surely Hölder continuous with any exponent $\\gamma$ such that $\\gamma \\in (0, \\delta/p)$. The problem asks for the maximal Hölder exponent guaranteed by this theorem, which is the supremum of this interval for $\\gamma$.\n\nWe compare our derived moment bound with the condition of the theorem:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[|B_t^H - B_s^H|^p] = C_p |t-s|^{Hp}\n$$\nWe identify the constants by setting $K = C_p$ and matching the exponents:\n$$\n1 + \\delta = Hp\n$$\nThe problem specifies that we must choose $p$ such that $Hp > 1$. This condition ensures that $\\delta = Hp - 1 > 0$, which is a necessary requirement for the theorem to yield a non-trivial conclusion about Hölder continuity.\n\nWith $\\delta = Hp - 1$, the theorem guarantees that the sample paths of a modification of fBm are Hölder continuous for any exponent $\\gamma$ satisfying:\n$$\n0  \\gamma  \\frac{\\delta}{p}\n$$\nThe maximal Hölder exponent guaranteed by this bound is the supremum of the possible values for $\\gamma$:\n$$\n\\gamma_{\\max} = \\frac{\\delta}{p} = \\frac{Hp - 1}{p} = H - \\frac{1}{p}\n$$\nThis expression gives the guaranteed Hölder exponent in terms of the Hurst parameter $H$ and the chosen moment order $p$. It is important to note that this is the exponent guaranteed by this specific application of KCT; the true Hölder exponent of fBm paths is known to be any value less than $H$, which can be seen as the limit of our result as $p \\to \\infty$.

For small increments $|t-s| \\to 0$, since $p \\ge 2$, the term $|t-s|^{p/2}$ dominates $|t-s|^p$. Thus, for a given compact interval, we can find a constant $K_p$ such that $\\mathbb{E}[|X_t - X_s|^p] \\le K_p|t-s|^{p/2}$.\nTo apply the Kolmogorov theorem, we set the moment order to $p$ and match exponents $1+\\beta = p/2$. The requirement $\\beta > 0$ translates to $p/2 > 1$, or $p > 2$. For any integer $p \\ge 3$, the condition is met. The theorem then guarantees the existence of a continuous modification whose sample paths are a.s.

Hölder continuous for any exponent $\\gamma  1/2$. The theorem itself does not provide information about the endpoint $\\gamma = 1/2$.\n\nThe solution to the SDE can be written in integral form:\n$$\nX_t = X_0 + \\int_0^t b(X_s)\\,ds + \\int_0^t \\sigma(X_s)\\,dW_s\n$$\nLet's analyze the regularity of each term.\n1.  **Drift Term:** $I^b_t = \\int_0^t b(X_s)\\,ds$. Since $X_s$ is a continuous process and $b$ is a continuous function (as it is Lipschitz), the integrand $s \\mapsto b(X_s(\\omega))$ is a continuous function for almost every path $\\omega$. By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, $I^b_t$ is pathwise continuously differentiable with derivative $b(X_t)$. A $C^1$ function on a compact interval is Lipschitz continuous, which in turn implies it is Hölder continuous of order $1$.\n2.  **Diffusion Term:** $I^\\sigma_t = \\int_0^t \\sigma(X_s)\\,dW_s$. The regularity of $X_t$ is determined by this stochastic integral term, as it is rougher than the drift term. The quadratic variation of this Itô integral is $\\langle I^\\sigma \\rangle_t = \\int_0^t \\sigma(X_s)^2\\,ds$. The uniform ellipticity condition $\\sigma(x)^2 \\ge c  0$, combined with $\\sigma$ being bounded, implies that the time-change $\\tau_t = \\langle I^\\sigma \\rangle_t$ is a bi-Lipschitz function of $t$. By the Dambis-Dubins-Schwarz theorem, the process $B_u = I^\\sigma_{\\tau^{-1}(u)}$ is a standard Brownian motion. Since $I^\\sigma_t = B_{\\tau_t}$ and $\\tau_t$ is a bi-Lipschitz time change, the process $I^\\sigma_t$ inherits the Hölder regularity of standard Brownian motion. It is a classical result that standard Brownian motion is a.s. locally Hölder continuous for any exponent $\\gamma  1/2$, but is a.s. *not* locally Hölder continuous for any exponent $\\gamma \\ge 1/2$. Therefore, $I^\\sigma_t$ is also a.s. not Hölder continuous of order $1/2$.\n3.  **Total Solution:** $X_t = X_0 + I^b_t + I^\\sigma_t$. The sum of a Hölder-$1$ process ($I^b_t$) and a process that is not Hölder-$1/2$ ($I^\\sigma_t$) cannot be Hölder-$1/2$. If it were, then $I^\\sigma_t = X_t - X_0 - I^b_t$ would be the sum of a Hölder-$1/2$ process and a Hölder-$1$ process, which must be Hölder-$1/2$. This is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the solution $X_t$ has sample paths that are a.s. Hölder continuous for any $\\gamma1/2$ but are a.s. not Hölder continuous of order $1/2$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. For standard Brownian motion $W_t$, the sample paths are almost surely Hölder continuous of every order $\\gamma\\tfrac{1}{2}$ but almost surely not Hölder continuous of order $\\tfrac{1}{2}$; thus the exponent $\\tfrac{1}{2}$ predicted by moment scaling is sharp in the sense that it cannot be improved to equality.**\nThis statement is a well-established fact in the theory of stochastic processes. The first part, asserting Hölder continuity for all $\\gamma  1/2$, follows from the Kolmogorov continuity theorem applied to the moments of Brownian increments, $\\mathbb{E}[|W_t-W_s|^p] = C_p|t-s|^{p/2}$. The second part, that paths are a.s. not Hölder continuous of order $1/2$, can be shown using the law of the iterated logarithm, which implies that $\\limsup_{h\\to 0} |W_{t+h}-W_t| / \\sqrt{h}$ is infinite on a dense set of $t$ (or even more strongly, $\\limsup_{h\\to 0} |W_{t+h}-W_t| / \\sqrt{2h\\log\\log(1/h)} = 1$ for any fixed $t$, a.s.). This prevents uniform Hölder continuity of order $1/2$. The conclusion that the limit exponent $1/2$ is sharp and cannot be attained is correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. For fractional Brownian motion $B_t^H$ with Hurst parameter $H \\in (0,1)$, the sample paths are almost surely Hölder continuous of every order $\\gamma \\le H$, so the exponent $H$ from increment moment scaling can be achieved as an equality.**\nFor fractional Brownian motion $B^H_t$, the moment scaling is $\\mathbb{E}[|B^H_t - B^H_s|^p] \\propto |t-s|^{pH}$. The Kolmogorov theorem implies Hölder continuity for any $\\gamma  H - 1/p$, and by taking $p \\to \\infty$, for any $\\gamma  H$. However, similar to standard Brownian motion (the case $H=1/2$), the sample paths of $B^H_t$ are almost surely *not* Hölder continuous of order $H$. The claim that they are Hölder continuous for $\\gamma \\le H$ is false due to the inclusion of the endpoint $\\gamma=H$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. For the SDE solution $X_t$ above with uniformly elliptic diffusion coefficient $\\sigma$, the sample paths are almost surely not Hölder continuous of order $\\tfrac{1}{2}$; the stochastic integral term determines the local roughness, and smoothness or boundedness of the drift $b$ does not raise the Hölder exponent to $\\tfrac{1}{2}$.**\nAs derived above, the solution $X_t$ is the sum of a smooth drift term (pathwise $C^1$, so Hölder-1) and a rough diffusion term. The uniform ellipticity of $\\sigma$ ensures that the diffusion term $\\int_0^t \\sigma(X_s) dW_s$ behaves locally like a scaled Brownian motion, which is not Hölder continuous of order $1/2$. The overall regularity of the sum is dictated by its roughest component. Therefore, $X_t$ is a.s. not Hölder continuous of order $1/2$. The smoothness of the drift term does not regularize the process beyond the limit set by the diffusion term. This statement accurately describes the situation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. If the drift $b$ is continuously differentiable and bounded, then it regularizes the solution $X_t$ sufficiently to guarantee almost sure Hölder continuity of order $\\tfrac{1}{2}$ everywhere, even when the diffusion coefficient $\\sigma$ is uniformly elliptic and bounded.**\nThis statement contradicts the reasoning for option C. While a smoother drift $b$ (e.g., $C^1$) makes the drift integral component $\\int_0^t b(X_s) ds$ smoother pathwise, it cannot overcome the intrinsic roughness of the stochastic integral term $\\int_0^t \\sigma(X_s) dW_s$. As long as the diffusion is non-degenerate (i.e., $\\sigma$ is uniformly elliptic), the process retains the local character of Brownian motion, which is not Hölder-$1/2$. Therefore, additional regularity on the drift does not raise the Hölder exponent of the solution to $1/2$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "2983291"}]}
