It is a standard problem in the theory of one-dimensional diffusions, firmly based on established mathematical principles. The definitions and relationships between the SDE, the generator, the scale function, and the speed measure are canonical. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions. The normalization $s(0)=0$ is a valid choice to fix the affine ambiguity of the scale function, treating $x=0$ as a reference point for integrals over $(0, \\infty)$. All terms are formally defined within the field of stochastic processes.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\n**1. Construction of the Scale Function $s(x)$**\nThe scale function $s(x)$ for a one-dimensional diffusion is defined as a solution to the ordinary differential equation (ODE) $\\mathcal{L}s(x) = 0$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{2}\\,s''(x) + \\mu\\,s'(x) = 0\n$$\nLet $u(x) = s'(x)$. The equation becomes a first-order linear ODE for $u(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{2}\\,u'(x) = -\\mu\\,u(x) \\implies u'(x) = -\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2} u(x)\n$$\nThe general solution is $u(x) = C_1 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2} x\\right)$ for some constant $C_1$. Since $s(x)$ must be strictly increasing, we need $s'(x) = u(x)  0$. As $\\exp(\\cdot)$ is always positive, this requires $C_1  0$. For definiteness, we choose the simplest representative by setting $C_1 = 1$. Thus,\n$$\ns'(x) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2} x\\right)\n$$\nTo find $s(x)$, we integrate $s'(y)$ from $0$ to $x$ to satisfy the normalization condition $s(0) = 0$.\n$$\ns(x) = \\int_0^x s'(y) \\mathrm{d}y = \\int_0^x \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2} y\\right) \\mathrm{d}y\n$$\nWe consider two cases based on the value of $\\mu$.\n\nCase 1: $\\mu \\neq 0$. The integral evaluates to:\n$$\ns(x) = \\left[ -\\frac{\\sigma^2}{2\\mu} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2} y\\right) \\right]_0^x = -\\frac{\\sigma^2}{2\\mu} \\left(\\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2} x\\right) - \\exp(0)\\right) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2\\mu} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2} x\\right)\\right)\n$$\nCase 2: $\\mu = 0$. The derivative is $s'(x) = \\exp(0) = 1$. The integral is:\n$$\ns(x) = \\int_0^x 1 \\mathrm{d}y = x\n$$\n\n**2. The Limit $s(\\infty)$**\nWe now determine the limit of $s(x)$ as $x \\to \\infty$.\n\nCase 1: $\\mu  0$. The term $-\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2}$ is negative. As $x \\to \\infty$, the exponent $-\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2}x \\to -\\infty$, so $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2} x\\right) \\to 0$.\n$$\ns(\\infty) = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2\\mu} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2} x\\right)\\right) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2\\mu} (1 - 0) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2\\mu}\n$$\nIn this case, $s(\\infty)$ is finite.\n\nCase 2: $\\mu  0$. The term $-\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2}$ is positive. As $x \\to \\infty$, the exponent $-\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2}x \\to \\infty$, so $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2} x\\right) \\to \\infty$.\n$$\ns(\\infty) = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2\\mu} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2} x\\right)\\right) = \\infty\n$$\nThe factor $\\frac{\\sigma^2}{2\\mu}$ is negative, and the term in the parenthesis tends to $-\\infty$, so their product tends to $+\\infty$.\n\nCase 3: $\\mu = 0$. $s(x) = x$, so $s(\\infty) = \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} x = \\infty$.\n\nIn summary, $s(\\infty)$ is finite if $\\mu  0$ and infinite if $\\mu \\le 0$.\n\n**3. The Speed Measure Density and Integral**\nThe speed measure density $m(x)$ is defined by the relation $m(x) = \\frac{2}{\\sigma^2(x) s'(x)}$. Since $\\sigma$ is constant, we have:\n$$\nm(x) = \\frac{2}{\\sigma^{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2} x\\right)} = \\frac{2}{\\sigma^2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2} x\\right)\n$$\nNext, we compute the total speed measure on $(0, \\infty)$, $M(\\infty) = \\int_0^\\infty m(x) \\mathrm{d}x$:\n$$\nM(\\infty) = \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{2}{\\sigma^2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2} x\\right) \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nThe convergence of this integral depends on the sign of the exponent's coefficient $\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2}$, which has the same sign as $\\mu$.\n\nCase 1: $\\mu \\ge 0$. The exponent is non-negative, so the integrand is non-decaying. The integral diverges: $M(\\infty) = \\infty$.\n\nCase 2: $\\mu  0$. The exponent is negative, so the integral converges.\n$$\nM(\\infty) = \\frac{2}{\\sigma^2} \\left[ \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2\\mu} \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2} x\\right) \\right]_0^\\infty = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\left[ \\lim_{x\\to\\infty} \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2} x\\right) - \\exp(0) \\right] = \\frac{1}{\\mu} (0 - 1) = -\\frac{1}{\\mu}\n$$\nIn summary, $M(\\infty)$ is infinite if $\\mu \\ge 0$ and finite if $\\mu  0$. The value for $\\mu  0$ is $-\\frac{1}{\\mu}$.\n\n**4. Boundary Classification at $\\infty$**\nThe classification of the boundary at $\\infty$ depends on the finiteness of $s(\\infty)$ and the integrability of $m(x)$ and other related quantities.\n\nCase 1: $\\mu  0$. We found $s(\\infty) = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2\\mu}  \\infty$. A finite scale function implies the boundary is **accessible** (attainable). To further classify it, we check the integral of the speed measure. As shown in part 3, for $\\mu  0$, $\\int_0^\\infty m(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\infty$. An accessible boundary with an infinite speed measure integral is classified as an **exit** boundary. The process can reach $\\infty$ in finite time, but it is absorbed there. The problem asks to evaluate $\\int_0^\\infty (s(\\infty)-s(x))m(x)\\mathrm{d}x$. We compute the integrand:\n$$\n(s(\\infty) - s(x))m(x) = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma^2}{2\\mu} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2} x\\right)\\right) \\left(\\frac{2}{\\sigma^2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2} x\\right)\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\mu}\n$$\nThe integral is $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\mathrm{d}x = \\infty$. This confirms that the boundary is not regular.\n\nCase 2: $\\mu  0$. We found $s(\\infty) = \\infty$. This immediately implies the boundary is **inaccessible** (unattainable). To distinguish between an entrance and a natural boundary, we must check other integrals. The problem asks to evaluate $\\int_0^\\infty (s(x)-s(0))m(x)\\mathrm{d}x$. Since $s(0)=0$, this is $\\int_0^\\infty s(x)m(x)\\mathrm{d}x$. The integrand is:\n$$\ns(x)m(x) = \\left(\\frac{\\sigma^2}{2\\mu} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2} x\\right)\\right)\\right) \\left(\\frac{2}{\\sigma^2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2} x\\right)\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2} x\\right) - 1\\right)\n$$\nThe integral is:\n$$\n\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2} x\\right) - 1\\right) \\mathrm{d}x = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\left[ \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2\\mu} \\exp\\left(\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2} x\\right) - x \\right]_0^\\infty\n$$\nAs $x\\to\\infty$, the term $-x \\to -\\infty$, causing the integral to diverge to $+\\infty$ (since it is multiplied by $1/\\mu  0$). Since this integral diverges, the boundary is not an entrance boundary. An inaccessible boundary that is not entrance is a **natural** boundary. This means the process can neither reach $\\infty$ in finite time nor start from $\\infty$.\n\nSummary of the effect of the sign of $\\mu$:\n- For $\\mu  0$, the positive drift pushes the process towards $\\infty$. The scale function is bounded ($s(\\infty)  \\infty$), so the boundary is accessible. Since the speed measure is not integrable, it is an **exit** boundary.\n- For $\\mu \\le 0$, the drift pushes the process away from or is neutral with respect to $\\infty$. The scale function is unbounded ($s(\\infty) = \\infty$), so the boundary is inaccessible. Further analysis shows it is a **natural** boundary.\n\nThe final calculation required is the value of the speed measure integral $M(\\infty)$ for $\\mu0$. As derived in part 3, this value is:\n$$\nM(\\infty) = -\\frac{1}{\\mu}\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-\\frac{1}{\\mu}}$$", "id": "2970110"}, {"introduction": "We now turn to Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM), a cornerstone model in financial mathematics often used to describe the evolution of stock prices.

The equation for $u(x)$ is a first-order linear ODE:\n$$ u'(x) + \\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2 x} u(x) = 0 $$\nThis equation is separable: $\\frac{du}{u} = -\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2 x} dx$. Integrating both sides gives:\n$$ \\ln(u(x)) = -\\frac{2\\mu}{\\sigma^2} \\ln(x) + C_0 $$\nwhere $C_0$ is a constant of integration.
