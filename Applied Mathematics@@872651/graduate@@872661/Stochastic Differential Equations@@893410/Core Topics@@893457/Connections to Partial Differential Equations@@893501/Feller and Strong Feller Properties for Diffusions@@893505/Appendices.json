We want to show $(P_{t}f)(x_{n}, y_{n}) \\to (P_{t}f)(x, y)$. The function $h(x', y', z) = f(z, y') \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(z-x')^{2}}{2t}\\right)$ is continuous in $(x', y')$ for each fixed $z$. Also, $|h(x', y', z)| \\le \\|f\\|_{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(z-x')^{2}}{2t}\\right)$. Since $f$ is bounded, and the Gaussian kernel is integrable with respect to $z$ (with integral $1$), we can apply the Dominated Convergence Theorem to show that $(P_{t}f)(x,y)$ is continuous in $(x,y)$.\nVanishing at infinity: We need to show $\\lim_{|(x,y)| \\to \\infty} (P_{t}f)(x,y) = 0$.\nCase 1: $|y| \\to \\infty$. Since $f \\in C_{0}(\\mathbb{R}^{2})$, for any $\\varepsilon  0$, there exists $M$ such that $|f(z,y)|  \\varepsilon$ for all $z$ whenever $|y|M$. Thus, for $|y|M$,\n$$\n|(P_{t}f)(x,y)| \\le \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |f(z,y)| \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(z-x)^{2}}{2t}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}z  \\varepsilon \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(z-x)^{2}}{2t}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}z = \\varepsilon.\n$$\nThis shows $(P_{t}f)(x,y) \\to 0$ as $|y| \\to \\infty$, uniformly in $x$.\nCase 2: $y$ remains in a bounded set, and $|x| \\to \\infty$. For any $\\varepsilon  0$, there exists $R$ such that $|f(z,y)|  \\varepsilon$ for all $y$ in the bounded set whenever $|z|R$. We split the integral:\n$$\n|(P_{t}f)(x,y)| \\le \\int_{|z|\\le R} |f(z,y)| \\frac{...}{...} \\,\\mathrm{d}z + \\int_{|z| R} |f(z,y)| \\frac{...}{...} \\,\\mathrm{d}z.\n$$\nThe second term is bounded by $\\varepsilon$. The first term is bounded by\n$$\n\\|f\\|_{\\infty} \\int_{-R}^{R} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(z-x)^{2}}{2t}\\right)\\,\\mathrm{d}z.\n$$\nAs $|x|\\to\\infty$, the interval $[-R, R]$ moves away from $x$, and the integral of the Gaussian kernel over this fixed-length interval tends to $0$. Thus, $(P_{t}f)(x,y) \\to 0$.\nSo, $P_{t}f \\in C_{0}(\\mathbb{R}^{2})$.\n\nSecond, we show that $(P_{t})_{t\\ge 0}$ is strongly continuous on $C_{0}(\\mathbb{R}^{2})$ at $t=0$, i.e., $\\lim_{t\\downarrow 0} \\|P_{t}f - f\\|_{\\infty} = 0$ for all $f \\in C_{0}(\\mathbb{R}^{2})$.\n$$\n|(P_{t}f)(x,y) - f(x,y)| = \\left|\\mathbb{E}[f(x+W_{t}, y)] - f(x,y)\\right| \\le \\mathbb{E}[|f(x+W_{t}, y) - f(x,y)|].\n$$\nSince $f \\in C_{0}(\\mathbb{R}^{2})$, it is uniformly continuous on $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$. For any $\\varepsilon  0$, there exists a $\\delta  0$ such that if $\\|(z_{1},y_{1})-(z_{2},y_{2})\\|  \\delta$, then $|f(z_{1},y_{1})-f(z_{2},y_{2})|  \\varepsilon/2$. Here we only change the first coordinate, so if $|w|  \\delta$, then $|f(x+w,y)-f(x,y)|  \\varepsilon/2$.\nWe write\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[|f(x+W_{t}, y) - f(x,y)|] = \\mathbb{E}[|f(x+W_{t}, y) - f(x,y)| \\mathbf{1}_{\\{|W_{t}|\\delta\\}}] + \\mathbb{E}[|f(x+W_{t}, y) - f(x,y)| \\mathbf{1}_{\\{|W_{t}|\\ge\\delta\\}}].\n$$\nThe first term is less than $\\frac{\\varepsilon}{2}\\mathbb{P}(|W_{t}|\\delta) \\le \\varepsilon/2$.\nThe second term is bounded by $2\\|f\\|_{\\infty}\\mathbb{P}(|W_{t}|\\ge\\delta)$. Since $W_{t} = \\sqrt{t} W_{1}$, where $W_{1}$ is a standard normal variable, $\\mathbb{P}(|W_{t}|\\ge\\delta) = \\mathbb{P}(|\\sqrt{t}W_{1}|\\ge\\delta) = \\mathbb{P}(|W_{1}|\\ge \\delta/\\sqrt{t})$. As $t\\downarrow 0$, $\\delta/\\sqrt{t} \\to \\infty$, so $\\mathbb{P}(|W_{1}|\\ge \\delta/\\sqrt{t}) \\to 0$. We can choose $t$ small enough so $2\\|f\\|_{\\infty}\\mathbb{P}(|W_{t}|\\ge\\delta)  \\varepsilon/2$.\nThus, for $t$ small enough, $|(P_{t}f)(x,y) - f(x,y)|  \\varepsilon$ uniformly in $(x,y)$.\nThis completes the proof that $(P_{t})_{t\\ge 0}$ is a Feller semigroup.\n\n(b) To prove that $(P_{t})_{t\\ge 0}$ is not strong Feller, we must find a bounded measurable function $g$ such that for some $t0$, $P_{t}g$ is not a continuous function. The strong Feller property requires that $P_{t}$ maps the space of all bounded measurable functions $B(\\mathbb{R}^{2})$ into the space of bounded continuous functions $C_{b}(\\mathbb{R}^{2})$.\nLet's consider the function suggested in part (c), $g(x,y) = \\mathbf{1}_{\\{y\\ge 0\\}}$. This function is bounded and measurable, but it is not continuous along the line $y=0$.\nFor any $t0$, let's compute $(P_{t}g)(x,y)$.\n$$\n(P_{t}g)(x,y) = \\mathbb{E}^{(x,y)}[g(X_{t},Y_{t})] = \\mathbb{E}[g(x+W_{t}, y)].\n$$\nSubstituting the definition of $g$,\n$$\n(P_{t}g)(x,y) = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{1}_{\\{y\\ge 0\\}}].\n$$\nThe expression $\\mathbf{1}_{\\{y\\ge 0\\}}$ depends only on the initial value $y$ and not on the random variable $W_{t}$. Therefore, it is a constant with respect to the expectation.\n$$\n(P_{t}g)(x,y) = \\mathbf{1}_{\\{y\\ge 0\\}} = \\begin{cases} 1  \\text{if } y \\ge 0 \\\\ 0  \\text{if } y  0 \\end{cases}.\n$$\nThe function $(x,y) \\mapsto (P_{t}g)(x,y)$ is equal to $g(x,y)$ itself. This function is not continuous for any $(x,0)$ on the $x$-axis. For instance, for any fixed $x$, $\\lim_{y\\downarrow 0} (P_{t}g)(x,y) = 1$ while $\\lim_{y\\uparrow 0} (P_{t}g)(x,y) = 0$.\nSince we found a bounded measurable function $g$ for which $P_{t}g$ is not continuous for any $t0$, the semigroup $(P_{t})_{t\\ge 0}$ is not strong Feller. The degeneracy of the diffusion (no noise in the $y$-direction) prevents smoothing of discontinuities along the $y$-axis.\n\n(c) We are asked to compute the jump $J(t)$ for the function $g(x,y)=\\mathbf{1}_{\\{y\\ge 0\\}}$.\n$$\nJ(t) = \\lim_{y\\downarrow 0}(P_{t}g)(x,y) - \\lim_{y\\uparrow 0}(P_{t}g)(x,y).\n$$\nFrom part (b), we have the explicit expression for $(P_{t}g)(x,y)$ for any $t0$ and any $(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$:\n$$\n(P_{t}g)(x,y) = \\mathbf{1}_{\\{y\\ge 0\\}}.\n$$\nThe limits are straightforward to compute.\nFor the limit from above ($y\\downarrow 0$), we consider values of $y0$.

Analysis of Hörmander’s Condition**\n\nHörmander's condition provides a sufficient criterion for the hypoellipticity of the second-order partial differential operator associated with the SDE. For the semigroup $P_t$ to be smoothing (e.g., strong Feller), this condition must hold. The condition is formulated in terms of the Lie algebra generated by the drift and diffusion vector fields.\n\nThe vector fields are $V_{0}(x,y) = (0,0)$ and $V_{1}(x,y) = (y,0)$.

The Lie bracket of two vector fields $F$ and $G$ is $[F,G] = FG - GF$.\n\nWe compute the first Lie bracket:\n$$\n[V_{0}, V_{1}] = V_{0}V_{1} - V_{1}V_{0}\n$$\nSince $V_{0}$ is the zero vector field, it annihilates any function, and thus as an operator, $[V_{0}, V_{1}] = 0 \\cdot V_{1} - V_{1} \\cdot 0 = 0$.\nAll higher-order Lie brackets involving $V_0$ will also be zero. For example, $[V_1, [V_0, V_1]] = [V_1, 0] = 0$.\nTherefore, the Lie algebra is simply the linear span of the initial vector fields:\n$$\n\\text{Lie}(V_0, V_1) = \\text{span}\\{V_0, V_1\\}\n$$\nTo check Hörmander's condition at a point $(x_p, y_p)$, we must evaluate the vector fields in the Lie algebra at that point and determine the dimension of the resulting subspace of the tangent space $T_{(x_p, y_p)}\\mathbb{R}^2 \\cong \\mathbb{R}^2$.\nHörmander's condition holds at $(x_p, y_p)$ if $\\text{dim}(\\text{Lie}(V_0, V_1)|_{(x_p, y_p)}) = 2$, which is the dimension of the state space $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n\nThe problem asks to check the condition at a point $(x,0)$. At any such point, the vector fields evaluate to:\n$$\nV_{0}(x,0) = (0,0)\n$$\n$$\nV_{1}(x,0) = (0,0)\n$$\nThe space spanned by these vectors at $(x,0)$ is:\n$$\n\\text{Lie}(V_0, V_1)|_{(x,0)} = \\text{span}\\{(0,0), (0,0)\\} = \\{(0,0)\\}\n$$\nThe dimension of this space is $0$. Since $0 \\neq 2$, Hörmander’s bracket condition fails at all points on the line $y=0$, including any point of the form $(x,0)$.\n\n**2. Semigroup Computation and Continuity Analysis**\n\nFirst, we solve the SDE system. The equation for $Y_t$ is $dY_t = 0$, which implies $Y_t$ is constant:\n$$\nY_{t} = Y_{0} = y\n$$\nSubstituting this into the equation for $X_t$:\n$$\ndX_{t} = y\\, dW_{t}\n$$\nIntegrating from $0$ to $t$ gives:\n$$\nX_{t} - X_{0} = \\int_{0}^{t} y\\, dW_{s} = y \\int_{0}^{t} dW_{s} = y W_t\n$$\nThus, the solution to the SDE system starting from $(x,y)$ is:\n$$\n(X_{t}, Y_{t}) = (x + y W_{t}, y)\n$$\nThe Markov semigroup $P_t$ is defined by $P_{t}f(x,y) = \\mathbb{E}[f(X_{t}, Y_{t}) \\mid (X_{0},Y_{0}) = (x,y)]$. We use the test function $f(u,v) = \\mathbf{1}_{\\{u=0\\}}$, which is $1$ if $u=0$ and $0$ otherwise.\n\nWe compute $P_{t}f(0,y)$ for a fixed $t  0$. The initial condition is $(X_0, Y_0) = (0,y)$. The solution is $(X_t, Y_t) = (y W_t, y)$.\n$$\nP_{t}f(0,y) = \\mathbb{E}[f(y W_t, y)] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{1}_{\\{y W_t = 0\\}}] = \\mathbb{P}(y W_t = 0)\n$$\nWe consider two cases for $y$:\nCase 1: $y \\neq 0$.\nThe condition $y W_t = 0$ is equivalent to $W_t = 0$. The random variable $W_t$ follows a normal distribution $N(0,t)$. For any continuous random variable, the probability of it taking a specific value is zero. Therefore, $\\mathbb{P}(W_t = 0) = 0$.\nSo, for $y \\neq 0$, $P_{t}f(0,y) = 0$.\n\nCase 2: $y = 0$.\nThe initial condition is $(X_0, Y_0) = (0,0)$. The SDE solution is $(X_t, Y_t) = (0 + 0 \\cdot W_t, 0) = (0,0)$ for all $t \\geq 0$. The process is deterministic and remains at the origin.\nThen, we compute $P_t f(0,0)$:\n$$\nP_{t}f(0,0) = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{1}_{\\{X_t = 0\\}} \\mid (X_0,Y_0)=(0,0)] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbf{1}_{\\{0=0\\}}] = \\mathbb{E}[1] = 1\n$$\nSo, we have $P_{t}f(0,0) = 1$.\n\nTo assess the continuity of the function $g(x,y) = P_t f(x,y)$ at the point $(0,0)$, we can examine the limit as $(x,y) \\to (0,0)$ and compare it with the value $g(0,0)$. Let's consider the limit along the path where $x=0$ and $y \\to 0$:\n$$\n\\lim_{y \\to 0} P_{t}f(0,y) = \\lim_{y \\to 0, y \\neq 0} P_{t}f(0,y) = \\lim_{y \\to 0, y \\neq 0} 0 = 0\n$$\nWe have found that $\\lim_{y \\to 0} P_t f(0,y) = 0$, while $P_t f(0,0) = 1$. Since the limit does not equal the function's value at the point, the function $P_t f$ is not continuous at $(0,0)$.\n\nThe strong Feller property for a Markov semigroup requires that $P_t f$ is a continuous function for any bounded measurable function $f$. We have found a bounded measurable function $f(u,v) = \\mathbf{1}_{\\{u=0\\}}$ for which $P_t f$ is not continuous. This demonstrates that the process does not possess the strong Feller property. This failure is a direct consequence of the degeneracy of the diffusion, which is precisely what the failure of Hörmander's condition at points on the $x$-axis indicated.\n\n**3. Computation of the Limit**\n\nWe are asked to compute the limit:\n$$\nL = \\lim_{y \\to 0} \\big( P_{t} f(0,y) - P_{t} f(0,0) \\big)\n$$\nThe limit as $y \\to 0$ considers values of $y$ in a punctured neighborhood of $0$, i.e., $y \\neq 0$.\nFrom our analysis in Part 2, we have:\n- For $y \\neq 0$, $P_{t}f(0,y) = 0$.\n- The value at $y=0$ is $P_{t}f(0,0) = 1$.\n\nWe substitute these into the expression inside the limit. For any $y \\neq 0$, the expression is:\n$$\nP_{t} f(0,y) - P_{t} f(0,0) = 0 - 1 = -1\n$$\nThe limit of a constant function is the constant itself.

The final goal is to use the results to identify the range of the dimension parameter $\\delta$ for which the process's semigroup is strong Feller at the boundary point $x=0$.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of $u(t,x;\\lambda)$\n\nWe are asked to find an explicit closed-form expression for $u(t,x;\\lambda) = \\mathbb{E}_{x}[\\exp(-\\lambda X_{t})]$ for $\\lambda0$. By the Feynman-Kac formula, $u(t,x) = u(t,x;\\lambda)$ must satisfy the backward Kolmogorov equation associated with the process $X_t$. The generator is given as $\\mathcal{L} f(x) = 2x f''(x) + \\delta f'(x)$. Thus, $u(t,x)$ solves the partial differential equation (PDE):\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}(t,x) = \\mathcal{L} u(t,x) = 2x \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2}(t,x) + \\delta \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}(t,x)\n$$\nfor $t0$ and $x0$. The initial condition at $t=0$ is given by the definition of $u$:\n$$\nu(0,x) = \\mathbb{E}_{x}[\\exp(-\\lambda X_{0})] = \\exp(-\\lambda x)\n$$\nsince $X_0=x$.\n\nWe seek a solution to this PDE of the form $u(t,x) = A(t) \\exp(-B(t)x)$. Let's compute the partial derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\left(A'(t) - A(t)B'(t)x\\right) \\exp(-B(t)x)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = -A(t)B(t) \\exp(-B(t)x)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = A(t)B(t)^2 \\exp(-B(t)x)\n$$\nSubstituting these into the PDE, we get:\n$$\n\\left(A'(t) - A(t)B'(t)x\\right) \\exp(-B(t)x) = 2x \\left(A(t)B(t)^2 \\exp(-B(t)x)\\right) + \\delta \\left(-A(t)B(t) \\exp(-B(t)x)\\right)\n$$\nDividing by $\\exp(-B(t)x)$ (which is never zero) and rearranging terms:\n$$\nA'(t) - A(t)B'(t)x = 2x A(t)B(t)^2 - \\delta A(t)B(t)\n$$\nFor this equation to hold for all $x0$, the coefficients of the powers of $x$ on both sides must be equal.\n\nEquating coefficients of $x^1$:\n$$\n-A(t)B'(t) = 2A(t)B(t)^2\n$$\nAssuming $A(t) \\neq 0$, we can divide by $A(t)$ to obtain an ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $B(t)$:\n$$\nB'(t) = -2B(t)^2\n$$\nThis is a separable ODE: $\\frac{dB}{B^2} = -2 dt$. Integrating yields $-\\frac{1}{B} = -2t + C_1$, or $B(t) = \\frac{1}{2t - C_1}$.\n\nEquating coefficients of $x^0$ (the constant terms):\n$$\nA'(t) = -\\delta A(t)B(t)\n$$\nThis gives another separable ODE for $A(t)$: $\\frac{A'(t)}{A(t)} = -\\delta B(t)$.\n\nNow, we use the initial condition $u(0,x) = \\exp(-\\lambda x)$. Comparing this with our assumed form $u(0,x) = A(0)\\exp(-B(0)x)$, we must have:\n$$\nA(0) = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad B(0) = \\lambda\n$$\nUsing $B(0)=\\lambda$ in the solution for $B(t)$:\n$$\nB(0) = \\frac{1}{-C_1} = \\lambda \\implies C_1 = -\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\n$$\nSubstituting $C_1$ back, we find the expression for $B(t)$:\n$$\nB(t) = \\frac{1}{2t + 1/\\lambda} = \\frac{\\lambda}{1+2\\lambda t}\n$$\nNow we solve for $A(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{A'(t)}{A(t)} = -\\delta B(t) = -\\frac{\\delta \\lambda}{1+2\\lambda t}\n$$\nIntegrating with respect to $t$:\n$$\n\\ln(A(t)) = \\int -\\frac{\\delta \\lambda}{1+2\\lambda t} dt = -\\frac{\\delta}{2} \\int \\frac{2\\lambda}{1+2\\lambda t} dt = -\\frac{\\delta}{2} \\ln(1+2\\lambda t) + C_2\n$$\nSo, $A(t) = \\exp(C_2) (1+2\\lambda t)^{-\\delta/2}$. Using the initial condition $A(0)=1$:\n$$\nA(0) = \\exp(C_2) (1+0)^{-\\delta/2} = \\exp(C_2) = 1 \\implies C_2=0\n$$\nThus, the expression for $A(t)$ is:\n$$\nA(t) = (1+2\\lambda t)^{-\\delta/2}\n$$\nCombining our results for $A(t)$ and $B(t)$, we obtain the explicit closed-form expression for $u(t,x;\\lambda)$:\n$$\nu(t,x;\\lambda) = (1+2\\lambda t)^{-\\frac{\\delta}{2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda x}{1+2\\lambda t}\\right)\n$$\n\n### Part 2: Computation of the Limit\n\nWe are asked to compute the limit $\\lim_{x \\downarrow 0} u(t,x;\\lambda)$. The derived expression for $u(t,x;\\lambda)$ is a continuous function of $x$ for $x \\in [0,\\infty)$, since $t0$ and $\\lambda0$. Therefore, we can find the limit by direct substitution of $x=0$:\n$$\n\\lim_{x \\downarrow 0} u(t,x;\\lambda) = \\lim_{x \\downarrow 0} \\left[ (1+2\\lambda t)^{-\\frac{\\delta}{2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda x}{1+2\\lambda t}\\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n= (1+2\\lambda t)^{-\\frac{\\delta}{2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\lambda \\cdot 0}{1+2\\lambda t}\\right) = (1+2\\lambda t)^{-\\frac{\\delta}{2}} \\exp(0)\n$$\n$$\n= (1+2\\lambda t)^{-\\frac{\\delta}{2}}\n$$\nThis expression is the Laplace transform of the law of the process $X_t$ when started from $X_0=0$.\n\n### Part 3: Identification of the Strong Feller Range for $\\delta$\n\nThe strong Feller property at the boundary point $x_0=0$ means that for any bounded measurable function $f$, the map $x \\mapsto (P_t f)(x) = \\mathbb{E}_x[f(X_t)]$ is continuous at $x=0$. That is, $\\lim_{x \\downarrow 0} (P_t f)(x) = (P_t f)(0)$.\n\n1.  **Implication of the limit in Part 2:** The result from Part 2 is $\\lim_{x \\downarrow 0} u(t,x;\\lambda) = (1+2\\lambda t)^{-\\delta/2}$. We also know that $u(t,0;\\lambda) = \\mathbb{E}_0[\\exp(-\\lambda X_t)]$. The law of $X_t$ starting at $0$ is a Gamma distribution $\\Gamma(\\text{shape}=\\delta/2, \\text{scale}=2t)$ for $\\delta0$, whose Laplace transform is indeed $(1+2\\lambda t)^{-\\delta/2}$. For $\\delta=0$, $X_t \\equiv 0$, so $\\mathbb{E}_0[\\exp(-\\lambda X_t)] = 1$, which also matches $(1+2\\lambda t)^0=1$. Thus, we have shown that\n    $$\n    \\lim_{x \\downarrow 0} \\mathbb{E}_x[\\exp(-\\lambda X_t)] = \\mathbb{E}_0[\\exp(-\\lambda X_t)]\n    $$\n    for all $\\lambda0$ and $\\delta \\ge 0$. By Lévy's continuity theorem for Laplace transforms, this implies weak convergence of the transition measures: $p_t(x,\\cdot) \\Rightarrow p_t(0,\\cdot)$ as $x\\downarrow 0$. This establishes that the semigroup has the Feller property (continuity for bounded *continuous* functions) at $x=0$.\n\n2.  **From Feller to Strong Feller:** The strong Feller property requires convergence for all bounded *measurable* functions. This is equivalent to the convergence of the transition measures in total variation norm: $\\|p_t(x,\\cdot) - p_t(0,\\cdot)\\|_{TV} \\to 0$ as $x \\downarrow 0$.\n\n3.  **Case $\\delta=0$:** For $x0$, $X_t$ has a density, so $\\mathbb{P}_x(X_t = 0)=0$. For $x=0$, the SDE $dX_t=2\\sqrt{X_t}dW_t$ implies $X_t \\equiv 0$, so $\\mathbb{P}_0(X_t=0)=1$. Let $f(y)=\\mathbf{1}_{\\{0\\}}(y)$. This is a bounded measurable function. We have $\\lim_{x\\downarrow 0} (P_t f)(x) = \\lim_{x\\downarrow 0} \\mathbb{P}_x(X_t=0) = 0$, but $(P_t f)(0) = \\mathbb{P}_0(X_t=0)=1$. Since $0 \\neq 1$, the semigroup is not strong Feller at $x=0$ for $\\delta=0$.\n\n4.  **Case $\\delta  0$:** For $\\delta0$, both $p_t(x,\\cdot)$ (for $x0$) and $p_t(0,\\cdot)$ are absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure. Let their densities be $p_t(x,y)$ and $p_t(0,y)$, respectively. By Scheffé's theorem, total variation convergence follows from pointwise convergence of the densities, provided we can justify interchanging limit and integral via a result like the Dominated Convergence Theorem (DCT). We analyze the Radon-Nikodym derivative $L_t(x,y) = \\frac{p_t(x,y)}{p_t(0,y)}$. We want to show that for any bounded measurable $f$, $\\lim_{x\\downarrow 0} \\mathbb{E}[f(X_t) L_t(x,X_t)] = \\mathbb{E}[f(X_t)]$, where the expectation is under the law $p_t(0,\\cdot)$.\n    The density is given by $p_t(x,y) = \\frac{1}{2t} (\\frac{y}{x})^{\\nu/2} \\exp(-\\frac{x+y}{2t}) I_{\\nu}(\\frac{\\sqrt{xy}}{t})$, with $\\nu = \\frac{\\delta}{2}-1$. Using the asymptotic $I_{\\nu}(z) \\sim \\frac{1}{\\Gamma(\\nu+1)}(\\frac{z}{2})^\\nu$ for small $z$, one can show that $\\lim_{x\\downarrow 0} L_t(x,y) = 1$ for each $y0$. By DCT, the limit and integral can be swapped if there is a dominating integrable function for $L_t(x,y)$. The key expression in $L_t(x,y)$ is of the form $C(x, t, \\delta) z^{-\\nu} I_\\nu(z)$ where $z = \\sqrt{xy}/t$.\n    -   If $\\delta \\ge 2$, then $\\nu = \\frac{\\delta}{2}-1 \\ge 0$. For $\\nu \\ge 0$, the function $z \\mapsto z^{-\\nu}I_{\\nu}(z)$ is known to be bounded for all $z \\ge 0$. This implies that $L_t(x,y)$ is bounded as a function of $y$ for each fixed small $x$. We can therefore apply the DCT, which proves that $\\|p_t(x,\\cdot) - p_t(0,\\cdot)\\|_{TV} \\to 0$. Thus, the semigroup is strong Feller at $x=0$ for $\\delta \\ge 2$.\n    -   If $0  \\delta  2$, then $\\nu = \\frac{\\delta}{2}-1 \\in (-1,0)$. For $\\nu \\in (-1,0)$, the function $z \\mapsto z^{-\\nu}I_{\\nu}(z)$ is unbounded as $z \\to \\infty$. The simple domination argument fails. It is a known fact that for this range of $\\delta$, the process starting from $x0$ can hit the boundary at $0$, and this change in qualitative behavior leads to the failure of the strong Feller property. The lack of a uniform bound on the Radon-Nikodym derivative is the mathematical manifestation of this failure.\n\nTherefore, the analysis of how to extend the weak convergence (implied by the limit in Part 2) to the stronger convergence required for the strong Feller property reveals that the argument is only straightforward for $\\delta \\ge 2$. This identifies $\\delta \\ge 2$ as the range for the strong Feller property at the boundary (it is in fact the correct range).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\left(1+2\\lambda t\\right)^{-\\frac{\\delta}{2}}}$$", "id": "2976306"}]}
