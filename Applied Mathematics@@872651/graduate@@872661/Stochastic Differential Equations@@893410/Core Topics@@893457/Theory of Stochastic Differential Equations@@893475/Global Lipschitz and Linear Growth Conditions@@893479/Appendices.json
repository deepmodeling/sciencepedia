Specifically, if $\\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} |f'(x)| = L  \\infty$, then by the Mean Value Theorem, for any $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$, there exists a $c$ between $x$ and $y$ such that $|f(x) - f(y)| = |f'(c)| |x-y|$. This implies $|f(x) - f(y)| \\leq L|x-y|$. The constant $L = \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} |f'(x)|$ is the smallest possible Lipschitz constant for $f$.\n\n**Analysis of the drift coefficient $b(x) = \\sin(x)$:**\nThe drift coefficient is given by $b(x) = \\sin(x)$. This function is differentiable for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Its derivative is:\n$$\nb'(x) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\sin(x) = \\cos(x)\n$$\nTo find the smallest global Lipschitz constant $L_b$, we compute the supremum of the absolute value of the derivative over $\\mathbb{R}$:\n$$\nL_b = \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} |b'(x)| = \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} |\\cos(x)|\n$$\nThe function $|\\cos(x)|$ has a maximum value of $1$. For example, at $x=0$, $|\\cos(0)| = |1| = 1$. The range of $|\\cos(x)|$ is $[0, 1]$. Therefore, the supremum is $1$.\n$$\nL_b = 1\n$$\nSince the derivative is bounded, $b(x) = \\sin(x)$ satisfies a global Lipschitz condition, and the smallest such constant is $L_b = 1$.\n\n**Analysis of the diffusion coefficient $\\sigma(x) = \\cos(x)$:**\nThe diffusion coefficient is given by $\\sigma(x) = \\cos(x)$. This function is also differentiable for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Its derivative is:\n$$\n\\sigma'(x) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\cos(x) = -\\sin(x)\n$$\nTo find the smallest global Lipschitz constant $L_\\sigma$, we compute the supremum of the absolute value of the derivative over $\\mathbb{R}$:\n$$\nL_\\sigma = \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} |\\sigma'(x)| = \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} |-\\sin(x)| = \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} |\\sin(x)|\n$$\nThe function $|\\sin(x)|$ has a maximum value of $1$. For example, at $x=\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, $|\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2})| = |1| = 1$. The range of $|\\sin(x)|$ is $[0, 1]$.

To find the smallest possible constant $K$, we can rearrange the inequality to solve for $K^2$:\n$$\nK^2 \\geq \\frac{1}{1 + |x|^2}\n$$\nSince this must be true for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $K^2$ must be greater than or equal to the maximum value of the expression on the right-hand side. Let's find the supremum of the function $g(x) = \\frac{1}{1 + x^2}$ over $\\mathbb{R}$.\nThe denominator $1 + x^2$ is always greater than or equal to $1$, with its minimum value occurring at $x=0$.\n$$\n\\min_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}}(1+x^2) = 1 + 0^2 = 1\n$$\nConsequently, the function $g(x)$ achieves its maximum value at $x=0$:\n$$\n\\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} g(x) = \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} \\frac{1}{1 + x^2} = \\frac{1}{\\min_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}}(1+x^2)} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1\n$$\nTherefore, the condition on $K^2$ becomes:\n$$\nK^2 \\geq 1\n$$\nSince the problem defines $K \\geq 0$, the smallest possible value for $K$ is $\\sqrt{1} = 1$.

We need to find the smallest such $L_{1}$.\n\nFirst, consider the drift coefficient $b_{1}(x)$. For any $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$:\n$$\n|b_{1}(x) - b_{1}(y)| = |(2x - 1) - (2y - 1)| = |2x - 2y| = 2|x - y|.\n$$\nThis demonstrates that $b_{1}$ is globally Lipschitz. The smallest constant $L_{b}$ for which $|b_{1}(x) - b_{1}(y)| \\le L_{b}|x-y|$ is the supremum of the ratio of differences:\n$$\nL_{b} = \\sup_{x \\ne y} \\frac{|b_{1}(x) - b_{1}(y)|}{|x - y|} = \\sup_{x \\ne y} \\frac{2|x - y|}{|x - y|} = 2.\n$$\nNext, consider the diffusion coefficient $\\sigma_{1}(x)$. For any $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$:\n$$\n|\\sigma_{1}(x) - \\sigma_{1}(y)| = |(-3x + 4) - (-3y + 4)| = |-3x + 3y| = 3|x - y|.\n$$\nThis demonstrates that $\\sigma_{1}$ is globally Lipschitz. The smallest constant $L_{\\sigma}$ for which $|\\sigma_{1}(x) - \\sigma_{1}(y)| \\le L_{\\sigma}|x-y|$ is:\n$$\nL_{\\sigma} = \\sup_{x \\ne y} \\frac{|\\sigma_{1}(x) - \\sigma_{1}(y)|}{|x - y|} = \\sup_{x \\ne y} \\frac{3|x - y|}{|x - y|} = 3.\n$$\nThe global Lipschitz constant $L_{1}$ for the pair $(b_{1}, \\sigma_{1})$ must satisfy both inequalities. Thus, $L_{1}$ must be greater than or equal to both $L_{b}$ and $L_{\\sigma}$. The smallest such constant is the maximum of the two individual constants:\n$$\nL_{1} = \\max(L_{b}, L_{\\sigma}) = \\max(2, 3) = 3.\n$$\nWith $L_{1}=3$, we have $|b_{1}(x)-b_{1}(y)|=2|x-y| \\le 3|x-y|$ and $|\\sigma_{1}(x)-\\sigma_{1}(y)|=3|x-y| \\le 3|x-y|$, which are both true. Therefore, $(b_{1}, \\sigma_{1})$ is globally Lipschitz with the minimal constant $L_{1}=3$.\n\n**Linear Growth Condition:**\nThe pair $(b_{1}, \\sigma_{1})$ satisfies the linear growth condition if there exists a constant $K_{1} \\ge 0$ such that for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$:\n$$\n|b_{1}(x)| + |\\sigma_{1}(x)| \\le K_{1}(1+|x|).\n$$\nWe need to find the smallest such $K_{1}$.

Using the triangle inequality $|u+v| \\le |u|+|v|$:\n$|2x-1| \\le |2x| + |-1| = 2|x|+1$.\n$|-3x+4| \\le |-3x| + |4| = 3|x|+4$.\nSumming these gives:\n$$\n|2x-1| + |-3x+4| \\le (2|x|+1) + (3|x|+4) = 5|x|+5 = 5(1+|x|).\n$$\nThis implies $\\frac{|2x-1|+|3x-4|}{1+|x|} \\le 5$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. This shows that the linear growth condition is satisfied with a constant $K_{1} \\le 5$.\n\nTo prove that $K_{1}=5$ is the smallest possible constant, we must show that the supremum is indeed $5$. We analyze the function $f(x) = \\frac{|2x-1| + |3x-4|}{1+|x|}$.\nConsider $x \\le 0$. In this case, $2x-1  0$ and $3x-4  0$. Also, $|x|=-x$.\n$$\nf(x) = \\frac{-(2x-1) - (3x-4)}{1+(-x)} = \\frac{-2x+1-3x+4}{1-x} = \\frac{-5x+5}{1-x} = \\frac{5(1-x)}{1-x} = 5.\n$$\nSince $f(x)=5$ for all $x \\le 0$, the supremum of $f(x)$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ must be at least $5$.\nAs we have already shown that $f(x) \\le 5$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we can conclude that the supremum is exactly $5$.\nTherefore, the smallest possible linear growth constant is $K_{1} = 5$.\n\n**Part 2: Analysis of $(b_{2}, \\sigma_{2})$**\n\nThe coefficient functions are given by $b_{2}(x) = x\\sin(x)$ and $\\sigma_{2}(x) = 0$.\n\n**Linear Growth Condition:**\nThe condition is $|b_{2}(x)| + |\\sigma_{2}(x)| \\le K_{2}(1+|x|)$, which simplifies to $|x\\sin(x)| \\le K_{2}(1+|x|)$ since $\\sigma_{2}(x)=0$. The smallest constant $K_{2}$ is given by:\n$$\nK_{2} = \\sup_{x \\in \\mathbb{R}} \\frac{|x\\sin(x)|}{1+|x|}.\n$$\nUsing the property $|\\sin(x)| \\le 1$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we have:\n$$\n|x\\sin(x)| = |x||\\sin(x)| \\le |x|.\n$$\nSince $|x| \\le 1+|x|$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, we can write:\n$$\n|x\\sin(x)| \\le |x| \\le 1(1+|x|).\n$$\nThis shows that the linear growth condition holds with a constant $K_{2} \\le 1$.\n\nTo show that $K_{2}=1$ is minimal, we must show that the supremum is $1$. Consider the function $g(x) = \\frac{|x||\\sin(x)|}{1+|x|}$.\nThe term $\\frac{|x|}{1+|x|}$ approaches $1$ as $|x| \\to \\infty$. The term $|\\sin(x)|$ reaches its maximum value of $1$ at points $x = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + n\\pi$ for any integer $n$.\nLet's choose the sequence of points $x_{n} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2n\\pi$ for $n = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$. As $n \\to \\infty$, we have $x_{n} \\to \\infty$.\nAt these points, $|\\sin(x_{n})| = |\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2} + 2n\\pi)| = |\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2})| = 1$.\nThe value of our function at these points is:\n$$\ng(x_{n}) = \\frac{x_{n}|\\sin(x_{n})|}{1+x_{n}} = \\frac{x_{n}}{1+x_{n}}.\n$$\nThe limit of this sequence is:\n$$\n\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} g(x_{n}) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{x_{n}}{1+x_{n}} = 1.\n$$\nSince we found a sequence of points for which the function values approach $1$, and we know the function is bounded above by $1$, the supremum must be $1$.\nThus, the smallest possible linear growth constant is $K_{2}=1$.\n\n**Global Lipschitz Condition:**\nThe pair $(b_{2}, \\sigma_{2})$ is globally Lipschitz if there is a constant $L \\ge 0$ such that $|b_{2}(x)-b_{2}(y)| \\le L|x-y|$ and $|\\sigma_{2}(x)-\\sigma_{2}(y)| \\le L|x-y|$ for all $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nThe diffusion coefficient $\\sigma_{2}(x)=0$ is a constant function, so $|\\sigma_{2}(x)-\\sigma_{2}(y)|=|0-0|=0 \\le L|x-y|$ for any $L \\ge 0$.\nThe problem thus reduces to determining if $b_{2}(x) = x\\sin(x)$ is globally Lipschitz.\nThis would require the existence of a constant $L$ such that for all $x \\ne y$:\n$$\n\\frac{|b_{2}(x) - b_{2}(y)|}{|x-y|} \\le L.\n$$\nTo prove that $b_{2}$ is not globally Lipschitz, we must show that the set of values of this ratio is unbounded.

For $x \\in [n+1, n+1+\\ell_{n+1}]$, the definition is $b(x) = A(s_{n+1} + x-(n+1))$.\n- From the right, $\\lim_{x \\to (n+1)^{+}} b(x) = A(s_{n+1} + (n+1)-(n+1)) = A s_{n+1}$.\nThe function is continuous at each integer $x=n+1$ for $n \\ge 0$.\nSince $b(x)$ is continuous for $x  0$ and $b(0)=0$, and it is defined as an odd function, $b(x)$ is continuous on all of $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\nThe function $b(x)$ is piecewise differentiable. For an absolutely continuous function like this, the minimal Lipschitz constant is the supremum of the absolute value of its derivative, taken over the points where the derivative exists. Let's compute $b'(x)$.\nFor $x  0$:\n- If $x \\in (n, n+\\ell_n)$ for some $n \\ge 0$, $b(x) = A(s_n+x-n)$, so $b'(x) = A$.\n- If $x \\in (n+\\ell_n, n+1)$ for some $n \\ge 0$, $b(x) = A(s_n+\\ell_n)$ which is a constant, so $b'(x) = 0$.\nThe set of points where the derivative may not exist for $x  0$ is $\\{n, n+\\ell_n\\}_{n \\ge 0}$.\nFor $x  0$, let $y = -x  0$. Then $b(x) = -b(y)$, and by the chain rule, $b'(x) = -b'(y) \\cdot (-1) = b'(y)$. Since $y  0$, $b'(y)$ is either $A$ or $0$.\nThus, for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ where $b'(x)$ is defined, we have $|b'(x)| \\in \\{0, A\\}$.\nThe supremum of the absolute value of the derivative is $\\sup_{x} |b'(x)| = A$.\n\nTo formally prove that $L_b = A$ is the global Lipschitz constant, we use the fundamental theorem of calculus for absolutely continuous functions. For any $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$ with $yx$:\n$$ |b(y) - b(x)| = \\left| \\int_x^y b'(t) \\, \\mathrm{d}t \\right| \\leq \\int_x^y |b'(t)| \\, \\mathrm{d}t \\leq \\int_x^y \\sup_{u} |b'(u)| \\, \\mathrm{d}t = \\left(\\sup_{u} |b'(u)|\\right) (y-x) = A|y-x|. $$\nThis shows that $A$ is a Lipschitz constant. To show it is the minimal one, we must demonstrate that no smaller constant works. Consider the interval $[0, \\ell_0] = [0, 1/2]$. For any two points $x,y$ in this interval, with $yx$:\n$$ |b(y) - b(x)| = |A(s_0+y) - A(s_0+x)| = |Ay - Ax| = A(y-x) = A|y-x|. $$\nThis equality shows that the constant $A$ is attained, and thus it is the minimal global Lipschitz constant.\nSo, $L_b = A$.\nBy identical reasoning, the minimal global Lipschitz constant for $\\sigma(x)$ is $L_\\sigma = B$.\n\nNext, we explain how global Lipschitz continuity implies a linear growth bound. A function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfies a linear growth condition if there exists a constant $K \\ge 0$ such that $|f(x)|^2 \\leq K(1+|x|^2)$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nSince $b(x)$ is globally Lipschitz with constant $L_b = A$ and we know $b(0)=0$:\n$$ |b(x)| = |b(x) - b(0)| \\leq L_b |x-0| = A|x|. $$\nSquaring both sides gives:\n$$ |b(x)|^2 \\leq A^2|x|^2. $$\nSince $|x|^2 \\leq 1+|x|^2$, we can write:\n$$ |b(x)|^2 \\leq A^2 (1+|x|^2). $$\nThis is the linear growth condition with constant $K=A^2$.\nSimilarly, for $\\sigma(x)$, we have $|\\sigma(x)|^2 \\leq B^2(1+|x|^2)$.\n\n### Task 2: Stability Estimate\n\nLet $X_t$ and $Y_t$ be two solutions to the SDE with initial conditions $X_0, Y_0 \\in L^2(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}_0, \\mathbb{P})$. Let $Z_t \\coloneqq X_t - Y_t$. The dynamics of $Z_t$ are given by:\n$$ \\mathrm{d}Z_t = \\mathrm{d}X_t - \\mathrm{d}Y_t = [b(X_t) - b(Y_t)]\\,\\mathrm{d}t + [\\sigma(X_t) - \\sigma(Y_t)]\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t. $$\nWe want to find an inequality for $\\mathbb{E}[|Z_t|^2] = \\mathbb{E}[(X_t-Y_t)^2]$. We apply Itô's formula to the function $f(z)=z^2$. We have $f'(z)=2z$ and $f''(z)=2$.\n$$ \\mathrm{d}(Z_t^2) = f'(Z_t)\\,\\mathrm{d}Z_t + \\frac{1}{2}f''(Z_t)\\,(\\mathrm{d}Z_t)^2. $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\mathrm{d}Z_t$ and noting that $(\\mathrm{d}Z_t)^2 = [\\sigma(X_t) - \\sigma(Y_t)]^2\\,\\mathrm{d}t$:\n$$ \\mathrm{d}(Z_t^2) = 2Z_t [b(X_t) - b(Y_t)]\\,\\mathrm{d}t + 2Z_t [\\sigma(X_t) - \\sigma(Y_t)]\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t + \\frac{1}{2}(2)[\\sigma(X_t) - \\sigma(Y_t)]^2\\,\\mathrm{d}t. $$\nIntegrating from $0$ to $t$:\n$$ Z_t^2 - Z_0^2 = \\int_0^t \\left( 2Z_s [b(X_s) - b(Y_s)] + [\\sigma(X_s) - \\sigma(Y_s)]^2 \\right) \\mathrm{d}s + \\int_0^t 2Z_s [\\sigma(X_s) - \\sigma(Y_s)]\\,\\mathrm{d}W_s. $$\nNow, we take the expectation of both sides. The expectation of the Itô integral (the stochastic integral term) is zero, as the integrand is adapted and assumed to satisfy necessary integrability conditions.\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[Z_t^2] - \\mathbb{E}[Z_0^2] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\int_0^t \\left( 2Z_s [b(X_s) - b(Y_s)] + [\\sigma(X_s) - \\sigma(Y_s)]^2 \\right) \\mathrm{d}s \\right]. $$\nUsing Fubini's theorem to interchange expectation and integration:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[Z_t^2] = \\mathbb{E}[Z_0^2] + \\int_0^t \\mathbb{E}\\left[ 2Z_s [b(X_s) - b(Y_s)] + [\\sigma(X_s) - \\sigma(Y_s)]^2 \\right] \\mathrm{d}s. $$\nWe now use the global Lipschitz properties of $b$ and $\\sigma$ to bound the term inside the expectation. We have $|b(X_s) - b(Y_s)| \\leq L_b|X_s-Y_s| = L_b|Z_s|$ and $|\\sigma(X_s) - \\sigma(Y_s)| \\leq L_\\sigma|X_s-Y_s| = L_\\sigma|Z_s|$.\nThe first term in the integrand is $2Z_s[b(X_s)-b(Y_s)]$. Using the inequality $uv \\leq |u||v|$ (a simple form of Cauchy-Schwarz):\n$$ 2Z_s[b(X_s)-b(Y_s)] \\leq 2|Z_s||b(X_s)-b(Y_s)| \\leq 2|Z_s|(L_b|Z_s|) = 2L_b Z_s^2. $$\nThe second term is $[\\sigma(X_s) - \\sigma(Y_s)]^2 = |\\sigma(X_s) - \\sigma(Y_s)|^2$:\n$$ |\\sigma(X_s) - \\sigma(Y_s)|^2 \\leq (L_\\sigma|Z_s|)^2 = L_\\sigma^2 Z_s^2. $$\nCombining these bounds:\n$$ 2Z_s [b(X_s) - b(Y_s)] + [\\sigma(X_s) - \\sigma(Y_s)]^2 \\leq 2L_b Z_s^2 + L_\\sigma^2 Z_s^2 = (2L_b + L_\\sigma^2)Z_s^2. $$\nTaking expectations, this inequality remains:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}\\left[ 2Z_s [b(X_s) - b(Y_s)] + [\\sigma(X_s) - \\sigma(Y_s)]^2 \\right] \\leq (2L_b + L_\\sigma^2)\\mathbb{E}[Z_s^2]. $$\nLet $\\phi(t) \\coloneqq \\mathbb{E}[Z_t^2] = \\mathbb{E}[|X_t - Y_t|^2]$. Substituting the bound into the integral equation for $\\phi(t)$:\n$$ \\phi(t) \\leq \\phi(0) + \\int_0^t (2L_b + L_\\sigma^2)\\phi(s)\\,\\mathrm{d}s. $$\nThis is an integral form of Grönwall's inequality. Let $C_0 = 2L_b + L_\\sigma^2$. The inequality is $\\phi(t) \\leq \\phi(0) + C_0 \\int_0^t \\phi(s)\\,\\mathrm{d}s$. The differential form is $\\phi'(t) \\leq C_0 \\phi(t)$. This implies that $\\phi(t) \\leq \\phi(0)\\exp(C_0 t)$.\nHence, we have the estimate:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[|X_t - Y_t|^2] \\leq \\mathbb{E}[|X_0-Y_0|^2] \\exp((2L_b+L_\\sigma^2)t). $$\nThe problem asks for the constant $C$ in the exponent, which is the smallest constant that can be obtained SOLELY from the global Lipschitz constants $L_b$ and $L_\\sigma$. The derivation above uses only these constants and standard inequalities. The inequality $2uv \\le 2|u||v|$ is sharp if $u,v$ have the same sign. The Lipschitz inequalities are sharp by definition of $L_b, L_\\sigma$. Therefore, the constant $C = 2L_b + L_\\sigma^2$ is the one requested.\n\nFinally, we substitute the values $L_b=A$ and $L_\\sigma=B$ found in Task $1$:\n$$ C = 2A + B^2. $$\nThis is the final expression for the constant.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{2A + B^2} $$", "id": "2978441"}]}
