It is a solution to the differential equation $\\mathcal{L} s(x) = 0$, which implies $\\frac{1}{2}s''(x) + \\mu(x)s'(x) = 0$.

Let $u = -y$, so $du = -dy$. When $y=0$, $u=0$.

Due to the symmetry of $\\mu(x)$ (since $\\mu(-x) = -\\mu(x)$), the behavior at both boundaries will be identical. We focus on the boundary at $+\\infty$.\n\nFeller's test states that a boundary (e.g., $+\\infty$) is an exit boundary (meaning it can be reached in finite time) if for some $a>0$, $\\int_a^\\infty m(y)s(y) dy  \\infty$, and natural if the integral is infinite. An equivalent and often more convenient test for explosion is to check if the integral $J = \\int_a^\\infty s'(y) (\\int_a^y m(z) dz) dy$ is finite. The process explodes if $J  \\infty$.\n\nLet's evaluate $J$. For convenience, we can choose $a=1$. Let $C = \\frac{2}{p+1}$, which is positive since $p>0$.\n$$\nJ = \\int_1^\\infty \\exp\\left(-Cy^{p+1}\\right) \\left( \\int_1^y 2\\exp\\left(Cz^{p+1}\\right) dz \\right) dy\n$$\nWe first analyze the asymptotic behavior of the inner integral, $F(y) = \\int_1^y 2\\exp(Cz^{p+1}) dz$, as $y \\to \\infty$. We can use integration by parts by writing $2\\exp(Cz^{p+1}) = \\frac{2}{C(p+1)z^p} \\frac{d}{dz}(\\exp(Cz^{p+1}))$.\n\\begin{align*}\nF(y) = \\int_1^y \\frac{2}{C(p+1)z^p} \\cdot \\left( C(p+1)z^p \\exp(Cz^{p+1}) \\right) dz \\\\\n= \\left[ \\frac{2}{C(p+1)z^p} \\exp(Cz^{p+1}) \\right]_1^y - \\int_1^y \\exp(Cz^{p+1}) \\left( \\frac{-2p}{C(p+1)z^{p+1}} \\right) dz \\\\\n= \\frac{2\\exp(Cy^{p+1})}{C(p+1)y^p} - \\text{const} + \\frac{2p}{C(p+1)} \\int_1^y \\frac{\\exp(Cz^{p+1})}{z^{p+1}} dz\n\\end{align*}\nFor large $y$, the last term is of a smaller order than $F(y)$. Thus, we have the asymptotic equivalence:\n$$\nF(y) \\sim \\frac{2\\exp(Cy^{p+1})}{C(p+1)y^p} \\quad \\text{as } y \\to \\infty\n$$\nNow we substitute this back into the expression for $J$. The integrand of $J$ is asymptotically equivalent to:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-Cy^{p+1}\\right) \\cdot F(y) \\sim \\exp\\left(-Cy^{p+1}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{2\\exp(Cy^{p+1})}{C(p+1)y^p} = \\frac{2}{C(p+1)y^p}\n$$\nThe convergence of the integral $J$ is therefore equivalent to the convergence of the integral:\n$$\n\\int_1^\\infty \\frac{1}{y^p} dy\n$$\nThis is a standard p-integral. It converges if $p>1$ and diverges if $p \\le 1$.\n\nRecalling Feller's test:\n- If $p \\le 1$, the integral $J$ diverges ($J=\\infty$). This means the process is **non-explosive**.\n- If $p > 1$, the integral $J$ converges ($J\\infty$). This means the process is **explosive**.\n\nThe problem states that for $0  p \\le p_c$ the diffusion is non-explosive, while for $p > p_c$ it explodes.
