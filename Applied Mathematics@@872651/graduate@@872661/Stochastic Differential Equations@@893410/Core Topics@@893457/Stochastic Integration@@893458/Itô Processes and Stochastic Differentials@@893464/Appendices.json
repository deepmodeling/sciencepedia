We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe process $X_t$ is a continuous semimartingale, being the sum of a deterministic process with finite variation and a scaled Brownian motion. We can decompose $X_t$ into two components:\n$1$. A finite-variation process, which we denote by $A_t = b\\,t$. This process has continuous paths and its total variation on $[0,t]$ is $|b|t$, which is finite. This is the drift component of $X_t$.\n$2$. A continuous local martingale, which we denote by $M_t = \\sigma\\,W_t$. This is the martingale component or diffusion component of $X_t$.\nThus, $X_t = A_t + M_t$.\n\nThe quadratic variation and covariation are bilinear operators. We will use this property, along with fundamental properties of these operators with respect to finite-variation processes and martingales.\n\n**Calculation of the Quadratic Variation $[X]_t$**\n\nThe quadratic variation $[X]_t$ is equivalent to the quadratic covariation $[X,X]_t$. Using the decomposition $X_t = A_t + M_t$ and the bilinearity of the covariation bracket:\n$$\n[X]_t = [A_t + M_t, A_t + M_t]_t = [A,A]_t + 2[A,M]_t + [M,M]_t\n$$\nWe analyze each term separately:\n- $[A,A]_t = [A]_t$: This is the quadratic variation of a continuous process with finite variation. Let $\\Pi = \\{0=t_0  t_1  \\dots  t_n = t\\}$ be a partition of $[0,t]$. The corresponding sum is:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (A_{t_{i+1}} - A_{t_i})^2 = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (b\\,t_{i+1} - b\\,t_i)^2 = b^2 \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (t_{i+1} - t_i)^2\n$$\nLet $\\Delta t_i = t_{i+1} - t_i$. The sum is $b^2 \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (\\Delta t_i)^2$. We have $\\sum_i (\\Delta t_i)^2 \\le (\\max_i \\Delta t_i) \\sum_i \\Delta t_i = \\|\\Pi\\|\\,t$. As the mesh $\\|\\Pi\\| \\to 0$, this sum converges to $0$. Therefore, $[A]_t=0$.\n\n- $[A,M]_t$: This is the quadratic covariation between a continuous finite-variation process and a continuous local martingale. The defining sum is:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (A_{t_{i+1}} - A_{t_i})(M_{t_{i+1}} - M_{t_i}) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (b\\,\\Delta t_i)(\\sigma\\,(W_{t_{i+1}} - W_{t_i})) = b\\,\\sigma \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\Delta t_i \\Delta W_i\n$$\nThe limit of this sum as $\\|\\Pi\\| \\to 0$ is $0$ in probability. Thus, $[A,M]_t=0$.\n\n- $[M,M]_t = [M]_t$: This is the quadratic variation of the process $M_t = \\sigma\\,W_t$. Using the scaling property of the quadratic variation, $[\\lambda Y]_t = \\lambda^2 [Y]_t$:\n$$\n[M]_t = [\\sigma W]_t = \\sigma^2 [W]_t\n$$\nA fundamental property of standard one-dimensional Brownian motion is that its quadratic variation is $[W]_t=t$. Therefore, $[M]_t = \\sigma^2 t$.\n\nCombining these results, the quadratic variation of $X_t$ is:\n$$\n[X]_t = 0 + 2(0) + \\sigma^2 t = \\sigma^2 t\n$$\n\n**Calculation of the Quadratic Covariation $[X,W]_t$**\n\nWe again use the decomposition $X_t = A_t + M_t$ and the bilinearity of the covariation bracket:\n$$\n[X,W]_t = [A_t + M_t, W_t]_t = [A,W]_t + [M,W]_t\n$$\n- $[A,W]_t$: This is the quadratic covariation between the continuous finite-variation process $A_t=b\\,t$ and the Brownian motion $W_t$. As established previously for $[A,M]_t$, the quadratic covariation between a continuous finite-variation process and a continuous local martingale is zero. Thus, $[A,W]_t = 0$.\n\n- $[M,W]_t$: This is the quadratic covariation between $M_t = \\sigma\\,W_t$ and $W_t$. Using the bilinearity property:\n$$\n[M,W]_t = [\\sigma W, W]_t = \\sigma [W,W]_t\n$$\nThe quadratic covariation of a process with itself is its quadratic variation, so $[W,W]_t = [W]_t=t$.\nTherefore, $[M,W]_t = \\sigma t$.\n\nCombining these results, the quadratic covariation between $X_t$ and $W_t$ is:\n$$\n[X,W]_t = 0 + \\sigma t = \\sigma t\n$$\n\n**Interpretation of the Covariation Term**\n\nThe quadratic covariation $[X,W]_t = \\sigma t$ quantifies the accumulated covariance of the infinitesimal random innovations of the processes $X_t$ and $W_t$ over the interval $[0,t]$. The stochastic differential of $X_t$ is $dX_t = b\\,dt + \\sigma\\,dW_t$. The coefficient $\\sigma$ determines the magnitude and sign of the influence of the Wiener process increment $dW_t$ on the increment $dX_t$. The quadratic covariation is the integral of the product of the diffusion coefficients of the two processes with respect to their common source of noise. In this case, the diffusion coefficient for $X_t$ is $\\sigma$ and for $W_t$ it is $1$. The rate of change of the covariation, $d[X,W]_t/dt = \\sigma$, is precisely this \"instantaneous noise coupling\" coefficient. If $\\sigma > 0$, the random components of $X_t$ and $W_t$ tend to move in the same direction. If $\\sigma  0$, they tend to move in opposite directions. If $\\sigma=0$, $X_t$ becomes a deterministic process, $X_t = b\\,t$, and has no random component, resulting in a zero quadratic covariation with $W_t$, indicating no noise coupling.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\sigma^2 t  \\sigma t\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2982388"}, {"introduction": "One of the most significant consequences of non-zero quadratic variation is that the standard rules of calculus no longer hold, leading to different formalisms for stochastic integration.

A defining property of the Stratonovich integral is that it obeys the classical chain rule. For a smooth function $f$, the Stratonovich chain rule is:\n$$df(W_t) = f'(W_t) \\circ dW_t$$\nAs before, we choose the function $f(x) = \\frac{1}{2}x^2$, for which $f'(x) = x$.

Failing condition (i) is sufficient to show a family is not uniformly integrable.\n\n**2. Uniform Integrability of Standard Brownian Motion**\n\nWe are asked to argue why the family of random variables $\\{B_{t}\\}_{t \\geq 0}$ constituting a standard Brownian motion is not uniformly integrable. We will use the necessary condition for uniform integrability, which is that the expectations must be uniformly bounded.\n\nFor a standard Brownian motion $\\{B_{t}\\}_{t \\geq 0}$ starting at $B_{0}=0$, the random variable $B_{t}$ for any $t  0$ follows a normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $t$, denoted $B_{t} \\sim N(0, t)$. The probability density function of $B_{t}$ is $f_{t}(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2t}\\right)$.\n\nWe calculate the expectation of the absolute value of $B_{t}$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[|B_{t}|] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |x| \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2t}\\right) dx\n$$\nDue to symmetry, this is equal to:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[|B_{t}|] = 2 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} x \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2t}\\right) dx\n$$\nLet's perform a substitution $u = \\frac{x^2}{2t}$, so $du = \\frac{x}{t} dx$, which means $x dx = t du$.

Therefore, the supremum is infinite:\n$$\n\\sup_{t \\geq 0} \\mathbb{E}[|B_{t}|] = \\infty\n$$\nSince the family of expectations $\\mathbb{E}[|B_{t}|]$ is not uniformly bounded, the necessary condition for uniform integrability is violated. Thus, the family $\\{B_{t}\\}_{t \\geq 0}$ is not uniformly integrable.\n\n**3. Verification of Stopping Time and Calculation of $\\mathbb{E}[B_{T}]$**\n\nFirst, we verify that $T = \\inf\\{t \\geq 0 : B_{t} = 1\\}$ is a stopping time with respect to the natural filtration $\\{\\mathcal{F}_{t}\\}_{t \\geq 0}$. A random variable $T$ is a stopping time if the event $\\{T \\leq t\\}$ is in the sigma-algebra $\\mathcal{F}_{t}$ for all $t \\geq 0$.\n\nLet's analyze the event $\\{T \\leq t\\}$. This is the event that the Brownian motion reaches the level $1$ at some time $s$ in the interval $[0, t]$.\n$$\n\\{T \\leq t\\} = \\{\\inf\\{s \\geq 0 : B_{s} = 1\\} \\leq t\\}\n$$\nA standard Brownian motion has continuous sample paths almost surely. Due to this path continuity, the infimum over a set of times is equivalent to saying that the maximum value of the process over the interval $[0,t]$ has reached or exceeded $1$. Let $M_t = \\sup_{s \\in [0,t]} B_s$. Then,\n$$\n\\{T \\leq t\\} = \\{M_{t} \\geq 1\\}\n$$\nThe random variable $M_{t}$ is the running maximum of the Brownian motion up to time $t$. The value of $M_t$ is determined by the path of the Brownian motion on the interval $[0,t]$. The information contained in $\\mathcal{F}_{t} = \\sigma(\\{B_{s} : 0 \\leq s \\leq t\\})$ is precisely this path information. Therefore, $M_{t}$ is an $\\mathcal{F}_{t}$-measurable random variable.\nSince $M_{t}$ is $\\mathcal{F}_{t}$-measurable, any level set of $M_{t}$, such as $\\{M_{t} \\geq 1\\}$, is an event in $\\mathcal{F}_{t}$.\nThus, $\\{T \\leq t\\} \\in \\mathcal{F}_{t}$ for all $t \\geq 0$, which confirms that $T$ is a stopping time.\n\nNext, we determine the value of $\\mathbb{E}[B_{T}]$. The stopping time $T$ is defined as the first moment the process $\\{B_t\\}$ hits the value $1$. Because the sample paths of a Brownian motion are continuous (almost surely), when the process is stopped at time $T$, its value must be exactly $1$. That is,\n$$\nB_{T(\\omega)}(\\omega) = 1 \\text{ for almost every sample path } \\omega.\n$$\nTherefore, the random variable $B_{T}$ is almost surely constant and equal to $1$.\nThe expectation is then straightforward to compute:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[B_{T}] = \\mathbb{E}[1] = 1\n$$\n\nFinally, we compare this result with $\\mathbb{E}[B_{0}]$. The problem states that $B_{0}=0$. Thus,\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[B_{0}] = \\mathbb{E}[0] = 0\n$$\nWe observe that $\\mathbb{E}[B_{T}] = 1$ while $\\mathbb{E}[B_{0}] = 0$, so $\\mathbb{E}[B_{T}] \\neq \\mathbb{E}[B_{0}]$.\nThe process $\\{B_{t}\\}_{t \\geq 0}$ is a standard Brownian motion and thus is a martingale. However, the conclusion of the Optional Stopping Theorem does not hold for the stopping time $T$. This failure is explained by the fact that the conditions of the theorem are not met. As shown in part 2, the martingale $\\{B_{t}\\}_{t \\geq 0}$ is not uniformly integrable. It can also be shown that for this specific stopping time, $\\mathbb{E}[T] = \\infty$, so another common version of the theorem (requiring finite expected stopping time) also does not apply. This problem serves as a canonical example illustrating that uniform integrability is a crucial condition for the Optional Stopping Theorem to hold.\n\nThe final answer requested is the value of $\\mathbb{E}[B_{T}]$. As calculated, this value is $1$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "2982390"}]}
