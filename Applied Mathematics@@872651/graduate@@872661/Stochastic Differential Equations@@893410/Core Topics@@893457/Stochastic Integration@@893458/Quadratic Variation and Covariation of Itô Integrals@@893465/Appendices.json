The definitions of Brownian motion, Itô processes, quadratic variation, and covariation are all standard and mathematically rigorous.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly defined and self-contained. The process $X_t$ is specified, and the quantities to be computed, $[X]_t$ and $[X,W]_t$, are well-defined objects in this framework. A unique, stable, and meaningful solution exists and can be derived from the provided definitions and fundamental principles of stochastic calculus.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, formal mathematical language, free from any subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe process $X_t$ is a continuous semimartingale, being the sum of a deterministic process with finite variation and a scaled Brownian motion. We can decompose $X_t$ into two components:\n$1$. A finite-variation process, which we denote by $A_t = b\\,t$. This process has continuous paths and its total variation on $[0,t]$ is $|b|t$, which is finite. This is the drift component of $X_t$.\n$2$. A continuous local martingale, which we denote by $M_t = \\sigma\\,W_t$. This is the martingale component or diffusion component of $X_t$.\nThus, $X_t = A_t + M_t$.\n\nThe quadratic variation and covariation are bilinear operators. We will use this property, along with fundamental properties of these operators with respect to finite-variation processes and martingales.\n\n**Calculation of the Quadratic Variation $[X]_t$**\n\nThe quadratic variation $[X]_t$ is equivalent to the quadratic covariation $[X,X]_t$. Using the decomposition $X_t = A_t + M_t$ and the bilinearity of the covariation bracket:\n$$\n[X]_t = [A_t + M_t, A_t + M_t]_t = [A,A]_t + 2[A,M]_t + [M,M]_t\n$$\nWe analyze each term separately:\n- $[A,A]_t = [A]_t$: This is the quadratic variation of a continuous process with finite variation. Let $\\Pi = \\{0=t_0  t_1  \\dots  t_n = t\\}$ be a partition of $[0,t]$. The corresponding sum is:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (A_{t_{i+1}} - A_{t_i})^2 = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (b\\,t_{i+1} - b\\,t_i)^2 = b^2 \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (t_{i+1} - t_i)^2\n$$\nLet $\\Delta t_i = t_{i+1} - t_i$. The sum is $b^2 \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (\\Delta t_i)^2$. We have $\\sum_i (\\Delta t_i)^2 \\le (\\max_i \\Delta t_i) \\sum_i \\Delta t_i = \\|\\Pi\\|\\,t$. As the mesh $\\|\\Pi\\| \\to 0$, this sum converges to $0$. Therefore, $[A]_t=0$.\n\n- $[A,M]_t$: This is the quadratic covariation between a continuous finite-variation process and a continuous local martingale. The defining sum is:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (A_{t_{i+1}} - A_{t_i})(M_{t_{i+1}} - M_{t_i}) = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (b\\,\\Delta t_i)(\\sigma\\,(W_{t_{i+1}} - W_{t_i})) = b\\,\\sigma \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\Delta t_i \\Delta W_i\n$$\nThe limit of this sum as $\\|\\Pi\\| \\to 0$ is $0$ in probability. Thus, $[A,M]_t=0$.\n\n- $[M,M]_t = [M]_t$: This is the quadratic variation of the process $M_t = \\sigma\\,W_t$. Using the scaling property of the quadratic variation, $[\\lambda Y]_t = \\lambda^2 [Y]_t$:\n$$\n[M]_t = [\\sigma W]_t = \\sigma^2 [W]_t\n$$\nA fundamental property of standard one-dimensional Brownian motion is that its quadratic variation is $[W]_t=t$. Therefore, $[M]_t = \\sigma^2 t$.\n\nCombining these results, the quadratic variation of $X_t$ is:\n$$\n[X]_t = 0 + 2(0) + \\sigma^2 t = \\sigma^2 t\n$$\n\n**Calculation of the Quadratic Covariation $[X,W]_t$**\n\nWe again use the decomposition $X_t = A_t + M_t$ and the bilinearity of the covariation bracket:\n$$\n[X,W]_t = [A_t + M_t, W_t]_t = [A,W]_t + [M,W]_t\n$$\n- $[A,W]_t$: This is the quadratic covariation between the continuous finite-variation process $A_t=b\\,t$ and the Brownian motion $W_t$. As established previously for $[A,M]_t$, the quadratic covariation between a continuous finite-variation process and a continuous local martingale is zero. Thus, $[A,W]_t = 0$.\n\n- $[M,W]_t$: This is the quadratic covariation between $M_t = \\sigma\\,W_t$ and $W_t$. Using the bilinearity property:\n$$\n[M,W]_t = [\\sigma W, W]_t = \\sigma [W,W]_t\n$$\nThe quadratic covariation of a process with itself is its quadratic variation, so $[W,W]_t = [W]_t=t$.\nTherefore, $[M,W]_t = \\sigma t$.\n\nCombining these results, the quadratic covariation between $X_t$ and $W_t$ is:\n$$\n[X,W]_t = 0 + \\sigma t = \\sigma t\n$$\n\n**Interpretation of the Covariation Term**\n\nThe quadratic covariation $[X,W]_t = \\sigma t$ quantifies the accumulated covariance of the infinitesimal random innovations of the processes $X_t$ and $W_t$ over the interval $[0,t]$. The stochastic differential of $X_t$ is $dX_t = b\\,dt + \\sigma\\,dW_t$. The coefficient $\\sigma$ determines the magnitude and sign of the influence of the Wiener process increment $dW_t$ on the increment $dX_t$. The quadratic covariation is the integral of the product of the diffusion coefficients of the two processes with respect to their common source of noise. In this case, the diffusion coefficient for $X_t$ is $\\sigma$ and for $W_t$ it is $1$. The rate of change of the covariation, $d[X,W]_t/dt = \\sigma$, is precisely this \"instantaneous noise coupling\" coefficient. If $\\sigma  0$, the random components of $X_t$ and $W_t$ tend to move in the same direction. If $\\sigma  0$, they tend to move in opposite directions. If $\\sigma=0$, $X_t$ becomes a deterministic process, $X_t = b\\,t$, and has no random component, resulting in a zero quadratic covariation with $W_t$, indicating no noise coupling.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\sigma^2 t  \\sigma t\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2982388"}, {"introduction": "Building on the basics, this next practice challenges you to compute the quadratic variation for an Itô integral with a time-dependent, but deterministic, integrand, $M_t = \\int_0^t s \\, dW_s$.

This is an increment of a martingale starting at time $t_j$. More formally, consider the process $Z_s = X_{t_j+s}-X_{t_j}$ for $s \\ge 0$. Then $Z_s^2 - [Z]_s$ is a martingale, so $\\mathbb{E}[Z_s^2 - [Z]_s | \\mathcal{F}_{t_j}] = Z_0^2 - [Z]_0 = 0$.
