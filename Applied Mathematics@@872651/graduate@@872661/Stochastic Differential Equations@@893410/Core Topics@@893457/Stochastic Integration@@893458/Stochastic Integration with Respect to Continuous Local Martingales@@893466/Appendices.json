The derivation relies on the application of Itô's formula for continuous semimartingales.\n\nLet us begin by stating the relevant theorem. A continuous local martingale is a specific type of continuous semimartingale. Let $X = (X_t)_{t \\ge 0}$ be a continuous semimartingale and let $f: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a function of class $C^2$ (i.e., twice continuously differentiable).

The first integral is a stochastic integral with respect to the semimartingale $X$, and the second is a Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral with respect to the quadratic variation process $\\langle X \\rangle_t$. The conditions given in the problem statement—that $f'$ and $f''$ have at most polynomial growth—are sufficient to ensure that the integrands $f'(M_s)$ and $f''(M_s)$ satisfy the necessary conditions for these integrals to be well-defined.\n\nIn the context of this problem, the continuous semimartingale $X_t$ is the continuous local martingale $M_t$. We are given the process $Y_t = f(M_t)$. We can directly apply Itô's formula by substituting $X_t$ with $M_t$. Thus, we have:\n$$\nY_t - Y_0 = f(M_t) - f(M_0) = \\int_0^t f'(M_s) \\mathrm{d}M_s + \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^t f''(M_s) \\mathrm{d}\\langle M \\rangle_s\n$$\nThis equation is the integral form of the SDE satisfied by $Y_t$.

The process $M_t$ is constructed from a standard Brownian motion $B_t$ and a continuous, increasing, adapted time-change process $\\tau_t$ with $\\tau_0=0$. The filtration for $M_t$ is given by $\\mathcal{G}_{t}:=\\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_{t}}$.\n\nFirst, let us establish the properties of the process $M_t = B_{\\tau_{t}}$. Since both the standard Brownian motion $B$ and the time-change process $\\tau$ are given as continuous processes, their composition $M_{t}(\\omega) = B_{\\tau_{t}(\\omega)}(\\omega)$ is also a continuous process for each $\\omega \\in \\Omega$. It is a standard result in the theory of stochastic processes that such a time-changed Brownian motion is a continuous local martingale with respect to the time-changed filtration $\\mathcal{G}_{t} = \\mathcal{F}_{\\tau_{t}}$. For any continuous local martingale, the predictable quadratic variation $\\langle M \\rangle$ and the (pathwise) quadratic variation $[M]$ are indistinguishable, i.e., they are the same process. We can therefore compute $[M]$ to find $\\langle M \\rangle$.\n\nThe problem statement invites the use of the pathwise definition of quadratic variation. For a continuous semimartingale $X$, its quadratic variation $[X]_t$ is defined as the limit in probability of the sums of squared increments over a sequence of partitions of the interval $[0, t]$ whose mesh tends to $0$. Let $\\Pi_{n} = \\{0=t_{0}^{(n)}  t_{1}^{(n)}  \\dots  t_{k_n}^{(n)}=t\\}$ be a sequence of partitions of the interval $[0, t]$ such that the mesh $|\\Pi_{n}| = \\max_{i} (t_{i}^{(n)} - t_{i-1}^{(n)})$ approaches $0$ as $n \\to \\infty$. The quadratic variation of $M$ at time $t$ is then given by:\n$$ [M]_{t} = \\operatorname*{p-lim}_{n\\to\\infty} \\sum_{i=1}^{k_n} (M_{t_{i}^{(n)}} - M_{t_{i-1}^{(n)}})^2 $$\nSubstituting the definition $M_{t} = B_{\\tau_{t}}$, the sum becomes:\n$$ S_{n} = \\sum_{i=1}^{k_n} (B_{\\tau_{t_{i}^{(n)}}} - B_{\\tau_{t_{i-1}^{(n)}}})^2 $$\nLet us define a new set of random time points $u_{i}^{(n)} = \\tau_{t_{i}^{(n)}}$. Since $\\tau_{t}$ is an increasing and continuous process with $\\tau_{0}=0$, the points $P_{n}(\\omega) = \\{0 = u_{0}^{(n)}(\\omega)  u_{1}^{(n)}(\\omega)  \\dots  u_{k_n}^{(n)}(\\omega) = \\tau_{t}(\\omega)\\}$ form a partition of the random interval $[0, \\tau_{t}(\\omega)]$ for almost every $\\omega$. The sum $S_n$ can be rewritten as:\n$$ S_{n} = \\sum_{i=1}^{k_n} (B_{u_{i}^{(n)}}} - B_{u_{i-1}^{(n)}})^2 $$\nThis is the sum of squared increments for the Brownian motion $B$ over the partition $P_n$ of the interval $[0, \\tau_t]$.\n\nWe must verify that the mesh of the partition $P_n$, denoted $|P_{n}| = \\max_{i} (u_{i}^{(n)} - u_{i-1}^{(n)})$, converges to $0$ as $|\\Pi_n| \\to 0$. The process $\\tau$ is continuous on the compact interval $[0, t]$, and therefore it is uniformly continuous on $[0, t]$. This means that for any $\\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that if $|t' - t''|  \\delta$ for $t', t'' \\in [0, t]$, then $|\\tau_{t'} - \\tau_{t''}|  \\epsilon$. As $|\\Pi_{n}| \\to 0$, we can make $\\max_{i}(t_{i}^{(n)} - t_{i-1}^{(n)})  \\delta$, which implies that $|P_{n}| = \\max_{i}(\\tau_{t_{i}^{(n)}} - \\tau_{t_{i-1}^{(n)}})  \\epsilon$. Thus, $|P_{n}|$ converges to $0$ almost surely as $n \\to \\infty$.\n\nIt is a fundamental property of standard Brownian motion $B$ that its quadratic variation is $[B]_{s} = s$ for any $s \\ge 0$. This means that for any random time $S$, the limit of the sum of squared increments of $B$ over any sequence of partitions of $[0, S]$ whose mesh tends to $0$ converges almost surely to $S$. In our case, for a fixed $\\omega$, the sum $S_n(\\omega)$ is the quadratic variation sum for the path $s \\mapsto B_s(\\omega)$ over the interval $[0, \\tau_t(\\omega)]$. As the mesh of the partition $P_n(\\omega)$ tends to $0$, this sum converges to the length of the interval:\n$$ \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} S_n(\\omega) = [B]_{\\tau_{t}(\\omega)}(\\omega) = \\tau_{t}(\\omega) $$\nThis convergence holds for almost every sample path $\\omega$. Therefore, we have established that the pathwise quadratic variation of $M$ is given by:\n$$ [M]_{t} = \\tau_{t} $$\nAs previously stated, for the continuous local martingale $M$, its predictable quadratic variation coincides with its quadratic variation, $[M]_{t} = \\langle M \\rangle_{t}$.\n\nWe can rigorously verify this result using the martingale characterization of the quadratic variation. The process $\\langle M \\rangle$ is the unique, continuous, increasing, and predictable process starting at $0$ such that $M_t^2 - \\langle M \\rangle_t$ is a local martingale. We propose that $\\langle M \\rangle_t = \\tau_t$. We verify the conditions:\n$1$. $\\tau_0=0$ is given.\n$2$. $\\tau_t$ is continuous and increasing by definition.\n$3$. $\\tau_t$ is adapted to $\\mathcal{F}_t$, and since $\\tau_t$ is increasing, it is straightforward to show it is also predictable with respect to the filtration $(\\mathcal{G}_t)$, as required.\n$4$. We must show that $M_t^2 - \\tau_t$ is a $(\\mathcal{G}_t)$-local martingale. It is a known result that for a standard Brownian motion, the process $X_s = B_s^2 - s$ is an $(\\mathcal{F}_s)$-martingale. By the time-change theorem for local martingales, if $X_s$ is an $(\\mathcal{F}_s)$-local martingale, then the time-changed process $Y_t = X_{\\tau_t}$ is a $(\\mathcal{G}_t)$-local martingale. Applying this theorem, the process $Y_t = B_{\\tau_t}^2 - \\tau_t = M_t^2 - \\tau_t$ is a $(\\mathcal{G}_t)$-local martingale.\n\nSince $\\tau_t$ satisfies all the required properties and $M_t^2 - \\tau_t$ is a local martingale, by the uniqueness of the Doob-Meyer decomposition, $\\tau_t$ must be the predictable quadratic variation of $M_t$.\n\nBoth methods confirm that the predictable quadratic variation of $M_{t}=B_{\\tau_{t}}$ is precisely the time-change process $\\tau_{t}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\tau_{t}}$$", "id": "2997674"}, {"introduction": "We now synthesize our understanding of stochastic integrals and their quadratic variations to tackle a practical calculation.
