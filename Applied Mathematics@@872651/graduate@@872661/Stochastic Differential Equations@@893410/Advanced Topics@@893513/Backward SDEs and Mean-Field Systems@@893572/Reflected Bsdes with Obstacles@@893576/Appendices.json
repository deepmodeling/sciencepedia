We analyze $g(x)=x^{1/(1-x)}$.\nThe logarithm is $\\ln g(x) = \\frac{\\ln x}{1-x}$. For $x \\in (0,1)$, $\\ln x  0$ and $1-x  0$, so $\\ln g(x)  0$. This implies $g(x)  1$.\nTherefore, $Y^\\tau_0 \\le (1-\\alpha)^{\\frac{1}{1-\\alpha}}  1$.\nThus, $0 \\le Y^\\tau_t  1$ for all $t \\in [0,\\tau)$, which confirms that $f(Y^\\tau_t)=(Y^\\tau_t)^\\alpha$ is the correct form of the driver. The quadratic part of $f$ is never active for this family of solutions.\n\nLet's summarize the verification of the triple $(Y^\\tau, Z^\\tau, K^\\tau) = (Y^\\tau, 0, 0)$ for any $\\tau \\in [0,1]$:\n1.  **Properties**: $Y^\\tau$ is continuous (as $\\lim_{t\\to\\tau^-}Y^\\tau_t=0=Y^\\tau_\\tau$), deterministic (hence adapted). $Z^\\tau=0$ is progressively measurable and square-integrable. $K^\\tau=0$ is continuous, non-decreasing, and $K^\\tau_0=0$. All these are satisfied.\n2.  **RBSDE**: We have shown that $Y^\\tau_t = \\int_t^1 f(Y^\\tau_s) ds$ for all $t \\in [0,1]$.
