We will first use the Ray-Knight theorem as instructed, and then re-derive the results from first principles using boundary value problems associated with the generator of the Brownian motion.\n\nLet $(B_t)_{t \\ge 0}$ be a one-dimensional standard Brownian motion with $B_{0} = 0$. Let $L_{t}^{y}$ be its local time at level $y$ up to time $t$. Let $\\tau_{a} = \\inf\\{t \\geq 0: B_{t} = a\\}$ for a constant $a  0$. We are asked to compute $\\mathbb{E}[L_{\\tau_{a}}^{a - x}]$ and $\\mathbb{E}[(L_{\\tau_{a}}^{a - x})^{2}]$ for $x \\in [0, a]$.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation using the Ray-Knight Theorem**\n\nThe second Ray-Knight theorem states that the process of local times $(L_{\\tau_{a}}^{a - x})_{x \\in [0, a]}$ is equal in law to a squared Bessel process of dimension $\\delta = 2$ started from $0$. Let us denote this process by $(Y_x)_{x \\in [0, a]}$, where $Y_{x}$ has the same law as $L_{\\tau_{a}}^{a - x}$. The process $(Y_x)_{x \\in [0, a]}$ is a $\\text{BESQ}(2)$ process, which satisfies the stochastic differential equation (SDE):\n$$ dY_x = \\delta dx + 2 \\sqrt{Y_x} dW_x, \\quad Y_0 = 0 $$\nwith dimension $\\delta = 2$. Here, $(W_x)$ is a standard one-dimensional Brownian motion with respect to the filtration generated by the process $Y$. Thus, the SDE for $Y_x$ is:\n$$ dY_x = 2 dx + 2 \\sqrt{Y_x} dW_x, \\quad Y_0 = 0 $$\nWe wish to find the first two moments of $Y_x$, which correspond to the desired expectations.\n\n1.  **First Moment: $\\mathbb{E}[Y_x]$**\n    We take the expectation of the integral form of the SDE:\n    $$ Y_x = Y_0 + \\int_0^x 2 ds + \\int_0^x 2 \\sqrt{Y_s} dW_s $$\n    Taking the expectation and using $Y_0 = 0$:\n    $$ \\mathbb{E}[Y_x] = \\mathbb{E}[Y_0] + \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_0^x 2 ds\\right] + \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_0^x 2 \\sqrt{Y_s} dW_s\\right] $$\n    The stochastic integral term has zero expectation because it is an Itô integral with respect to a Brownian motion, provided the integrand is non-anticipating and satisfies certain integrability conditions, which hold here. Thus, $\\mathbb{E}[\\int_0^x 2 \\sqrt{Y_s} dW_s] = 0$.\n    $$ \\mathbb{E}[Y_x] = 0 + 2x + 0 = 2x $$\n    Therefore, the first expectation is $\\mathbb{E}[L_{\\tau_{a}}^{a-x}] = 2x$.\n\n2.  **Second Moment: $\\mathbb{E}[Y_x^2]$**\n    To find the second moment, we apply Itô's formula to the function $f(y) = y^2$. We have $f'(y) = 2y$ and $f''(y) = 2$.\n    The quadratic variation of $Y_x$ is $d\\langle Y \\rangle_x = (2\\sqrt{Y_x})^2 dx = 4Y_x dx$.\n    $$ d(Y_x^2) = f'(Y_x) dY_x + \\frac{1}{2} f''(Y_x) d\\langle Y \\rangle_x $$\n    $$ d(Y_x^2) = 2Y_x (2 dx + 2\\sqrt{Y_x} dW_x) + \\frac{1}{2}(2)(4Y_x dx) $$\n    $$ d(Y_x^2) = 4Y_x dx + 4Y_x^{3/2} dW_x + 4Y_x dx = 8Y_x dx + 4Y_x^{3/2} dW_x $$\n    Now, we take the expectation. Let $m_2(x) = \\mathbb{E}[Y_x^2]$.\n    $$ d(\\mathbb{E}[Y_x^2]) = \\mathbb{E}[8Y_x dx + 4Y_x^{3/2} dW_x] = 8\\mathbb{E}[Y_x] dx $$\n    The expectation of the stochastic integral term is again zero. We obtain an ordinary differential equation for $m_2(x)$:\n    $$ \\frac{d m_2(x)}{dx} = 8 \\mathbb{E}[Y_x] $$\n    We substitute the result for the first moment, $\\mathbb{E}[Y_x] = 2x$:\n    $$ \\frac{d m_2(x)}{dx} = 8(2x) = 16x $$\n    Integrating with respect to $x$ from $0$ to $x$, and using the initial condition $m_2(0) = \\mathbb{E}[Y_0^2] = 0$:\n    $$ m_2(x) = \\int_0^x 16s ds = 16 \\left[ \\frac{s^2}{2} \\right]_0^x = 8x^2 $$\n    Therefore, the second expectation is $\\mathbb{E}[(L_{\\tau_{a}}^{a-x})^2] = 8x^2$.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation from First Principles**\n\nWe now re-derive these expectations without recourse to the Ray-Knight theorem. We will compute the moments of $L_{\\tau_a}^{y}$ for a fixed level $y \\in [0, a]$, where the Brownian motion starts at $B_0 = 0$. The expressions as a function of $x \\in [0, a]$ will follow by setting $y = a-x$.\n\nA powerful technique for computing moments of local times is to first find the Laplace transform of its distribution, $\\mathbb{E}[\\exp(-\\lambda L_{\\tau_a}^y)]$ for $\\lambda  0$. Let $u(z) = \\mathbb{E}^z[\\exp(-\\lambda L_{\\tau_a}^y)]$, where $\\mathbb{E}^z$ denotes expectation for a process started at $B_0=z$. This function $u(z)$ satisfies the following boundary value problem for $z \\in (-\\infty, a)$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} u''(z) = 0 \\quad \\text{for } z \\neq y $$\nwith boundary condition $u(a) = 1$ (since $L_{\\tau_a}^y = 0$ if $B_0=a$), and a jump condition at $z=y$ arising from the Feynman-Kac formula for local times:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}(u'(y+) - u'(y-)) = \\lambda u(y) $$\nWe also need a boundary condition as $z \\to -\\infty$. As $z \\to -\\infty$, the time to reach $a$ becomes very large, and the accumulated local time at $y$ will also be very large (almost surely). Thus $\\exp(-\\lambda L_{\\tau_a}^y) \\to 0$ almost surely, which leads to the boundary condition $u(z) \\to 0$ as $z \\to -\\infty$. This implies that $u(z)$ must be bounded for $zy$.\n\nThe general solution to $u''(z)=0$ is a linear function $u(z) = c_1 z + c_2$.\nWe distinguish two main cases for the level $y \\in [0,a]$.\n\nCase 1: $y \\in (0, a)$.\nOur starting point is $z=0  y$. We need to find $u(0)$.\nFor $z \\in (-\\infty, y)$, $u(z) = A_1 z + B_1$. The condition $u(z) \\to 0$ as $z \\to -\\infty$ requires $A_1=0$, thus $u(z) = B_1$ for $z \\le y$.\nFor $z \\in (y, a)$, $u(z) = A_2 z + B_2$. The condition $u(a)=1$ implies $A_2 a + B_2 = 1$, so $u(z) = A_2(z-a)+1$.\nContinuity at $z=y$: $u(y-) = u(y+)$, so $B_1 = A_2(y-a)+1$.\nJump condition at $z=y$: $\\frac{1}{2}(u'(y+) - u'(y-)) = \\lambda u(y)$. Here $u'(y+) = A_2$ and $u'(y-) = 0$.\nSo $\\frac{1}{2}A_2 = \\lambda u(y) = \\lambda B_1$. This gives $A_2 = 2\\lambda B_1$.\nSubstituting $A_2$ into the continuity equation: $B_1 = 2\\lambda B_1 (y-a) + 1$.\n$B_1(1 - 2\\lambda(y-a)) = 1 \\implies B_1 = \\frac{1}{1 + 2\\lambda(a-y)}$.\nSince we start at $z=0  y$, $u(0) = B_1$.\n$$ \\mathbb{E}^0[\\exp(-\\lambda L_{\\tau_a}^y)] = \\frac{1}{1 + 2\\lambda(a-y)} $$\nThis is the Laplace transform of an exponential distribution with rate $\\frac{1}{2(a-y)}$. An exponential random variable with rate $\\mu$ has mean $1/\\mu$ and second moment $2/\\mu^2$.\nThus, for $y \\in (0,a)$, $L_{\\tau_a}^{y}$ (for $B_0=0$) is exponentially distributed with mean $2(a-y)$.\nThe moments are:\n$\\mathbb{E}^0[L_{\\tau_a}^y] = 2(a-y)$\n$\\mathbb{E}^0[(L_{\\tau_a}^y)^2] = 2 \\times (2(a-y))^2 = 8(a-y)^2$.\n\nCase 2: $y = 0$.\nThe starting point is $z=0=y$. We need to find $u(0)$.\nFor $z0$, by the strong Markov property at the hitting time of $0$, $\\mathbb{E}^z[\\exp(-\\lambda L_{\\tau_a}^0)] = \\mathbb{E}^z[\\mathbb{E}^0[\\exp(-\\lambda L_{\\tau_a}^0)]] = u(0)$. So $u(z)$ is constant for $z0$, which means $u'(z)=0$ for $z0$.\nThis leads to the same equations as in Case 1, with $y=0$:\n$u(z) = B_1$ for $z \\le 0$.\n$u(z) = A_2(z-a)+1$ for $z \\in (0, a)$.\nContinuity at $z=0$: $B_1 = A_2(0-a)+1 = 1-a A_2$.\nJump condition at $z=0$: $\\frac{1}{2}(A_2 - 0) = \\lambda u(0) = \\lambda B_1$, so $A_2 = 2\\lambda B_1$.\nSubstituting $A_2$: $B_1 = 1 - a(2\\lambda B_1) \\implies B_1(1+2a\\lambda) = 1$.\n$u(0) = B_1 = \\frac{1}{1+2a\\lambda}$.\nThis is the Laplace transform of an exponential distribution with mean $2a$.\nThe moments are:\n$\\mathbb{E}^0[L_{\\tau_a}^0] = 2a$\n$\\mathbb{E}^0[(L_{\\tau_a}^0)^2] = 2 \\times (2a)^2 = 8a^2$.\n\nCase 3: $y=a$.\n$L_{\\tau_a}^a=0$ almost surely, since $\\tau_a$ is the first hitting time of $a$.\nThus, $\\mathbb{E}^0[L_{\\tau_a}^a] = 0$ and $\\mathbb{E}^0[(L_{\\tau_a}^a)^2] = 0$.\n\nCombining these results and substituting $y = a-x$ for $x \\in [0,a]$:\n- If $x \\in (0, a)$, then $y=a-x \\in (0, a)$. From Case 1:\n  $\\mathbb{E}[L_{\\tau_{a}}^{a-x}] = 2(a - (a-x)) = 2x$.\n  $\\mathbb{E}[(L_{\\tau_{a}}^{a-x})^2] = 8(a - (a-x))^2 = 8x^2$.\n- If $x=a$, then $y=0$. From Case 2:\n  $\\mathbb{E}[L_{\\tau_{a}}^{0}] = 2a$. The formula $2x$ gives $2a$.\n  $\\mathbb{E}[(L_{\\tau_{a}}^{0})^2] = 8a^2$. The formula $8x^2$ gives $8a^2$.\n- If $x=0$, then $y=a$. From Case 3:\n  $\\mathbb{E}[L_{\\tau_{a}}^{a}] = 0$. The formula $2x$ gives $2(0)=0$.\n  $\\mathbb{E}[(L_{\\tau_{a}}^{a})^2] = 0$. The formula $8x^2$ gives $8(0)^2=0$.\n\nThe formulas are continuous in $x$ and hold for the entire interval $[0, a]$. Both methods yield the same results, confirming their correctness. The final expressions are:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[L_{\\tau_{a}}^{a-x}] = 2x $$\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[(L_{\\tau_{a}}^{a-x})^2] = 8x^2 $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 2x  8x^{2} \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2993205"}, {"introduction": "A full understanding of a stochastic process requires looking beyond its value at a single point to how its values at different points relate to one another.

Its dynamics are described by the stochastic differential equation:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}X_{x} = 2\\sqrt{X_{x}}\\,\\mathrm{d}W_{x} + 2\\,\\mathrm{d}x, \\quad X_{0}=0\n$$\nwhere $(W_x)_{x \\ge 0}$ is a standard one-dimensional Brownian motion. We want to compute $\\mathbb{E}[X_{x} X_{y}]$ for $0 \\leq x \\leq y \\leq a$.\n\nWe use the tower property of conditional expectation. Let $\\mathcal{F}_x = \\sigma(W_s : 0 \\le s \\le x)$ be the filtration generated by the Brownian motion up to time $x$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X_{x} X_{y}] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{E}[X_{x} X_{y} | \\mathcal{F}_x]]\n$$\nSince $X_x$ is adapted to the filtration $\\mathcal{F}_x$, it is $\\mathcal{F}_x$-measurable. Therefore, we can take it out of the inner conditional expectation:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X_{x} X_{y}] = \\mathbb{E}[X_{x} \\mathbb{E}[X_{y} | \\mathcal{F}_x]]\n$$\nNext, we compute the conditional expectation term $\\mathbb{E}[X_{y} | \\mathcal{F}_x]$. We express $X_y$ by integrating its SDE from $x$ to $y$:\n$$\nX_{y} = X_{x} + \\int_{x}^{y} \\mathrm{d}X_{s} = X_{x} + \\int_{x}^{y} (2\\sqrt{X_{s}}\\,\\mathrm{d}W_{s} + 2\\,\\mathrm{d}s)\n$$\nTaking the conditional expectation with respect to $\\mathcal{F}_x$ and using linearity:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X_{y} | \\mathcal{F}_x] = \\mathbb{E}[X_{x} | \\mathcal{F}_x] + \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{x}^{y} 2\\sqrt{X_{s}}\\,\\mathrm{d}W_{s} \\middle| \\mathcal{F}_x\\right] + \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{x}^{y} 2\\,\\mathrm{d}s \\middle| \\mathcal{F}_x\\right]\n$$\nThe terms evaluate as follows:\n- Since $X_x$ is $\\mathcal{F}_x$-measurable, $\\mathbb{E}[X_{x} | \\mathcal{F}_x] = X_x$.\n- The Itô integral term $\\int_{x}^{y} 2\\sqrt{X_{s}}\\,\\mathrm{d}W_{s}$ is a martingale starting at time $x$ (assuming the integrand is well-behaved, which it is).

We integrate the SDE for $X_x$ from $0$ to $x$:\n$$\nX_x = X_0 + \\int_{0}^{x} 2\\sqrt{X_s}\\,\\mathrm{d}W_s + \\int_{0}^{x} 2\\,\\mathrm{d}s\n$$\nWith $X_0=0$, taking the expectation yields:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X_x] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{x} 2\\sqrt{X_s}\\,\\mathrm{d}W_s\\right] + \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{x} 2\\,\\mathrm{d}s\\right]\n$$\nThe expectation of the Itô integral is zero. The second term is deterministic.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X_x] = 0 + 2x = 2x\n$$\nNext, we compute $\\mathbb{E}[X_x^2]$. We use Itô's formula for the function $f(z) = z^2$. We have $f'(z)=2z$ and $f''(z)=2$. The formula states $\\mathrm{d}f(X_x) = f'(X_x)\\mathrm{d}X_x + \\frac{1}{2}f''(X_x)(\\mathrm{d}X_x)^2$.

The derivation must proceed from first principles, starting with the stochastic differential equation (SDE) for $Z_x$ and leveraging its properties as a continuous-state branching process (CSBP). The derivation follows a sequence of four prescribed steps.\n\nThe process $Z_x$ is described by the SDE:\n$$\ndZ_{x} = 2 \\sqrt{Z_{x}}\\, dW_{x}, \\qquad Z_{0} = \\ell\n$$\nwhere $(W_x)_{x \\geq 0}$ is a standard one-dimensional Brownian motion.\n\n**Step 1: Derivation of the infinitesimal generator $\\mathcal{A}$**\n\nAn Itô process described by the general SDE $dY_t = b(Y_t) dt + \\sigma(Y_t) dW_t$ has an infinitesimal generator $\\mathcal{A}$ that acts on a suitable twice continuously differentiable function $f$ according to the formula:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}f(y) = b(y) \\frac{df}{dy}(y) + \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma(y)^2 \\frac{d^2f}{dy^2}(y)\n$$\nFor the process $(Z_x)$, the SDE is given in terms of the \"time\" variable $x$. We can identify the drift and diffusion coefficients, $b(z)$ and $\\sigma(z)$ respectively, by comparing the given SDE to the standard form.\nThe drift coefficient is $b(z) = 0$.\nThe diffusion coefficient is $\\sigma(z) = 2\\sqrt{z}$.\nThe square of the diffusion coefficient is $\\sigma(z)^2 = (2\\sqrt{z})^2 = 4z$.\n\nSubstituting these into the formula for the generator, we obtain:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}f(z) = (0) \\frac{df}{dz}(z) + \\frac{1}{2}(4z) \\frac{d^2f}{dz^2}(z)\n$$\nThus, the infinitesimal generator for the BESQ(0) process is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{A}f(z) = 2z \\frac{d^2f}{dz^2}(z)\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Deduction of the branching mechanism $\\psi(\\lambda)$**\n\nThe problem states that $(Z_x)$ is a continuous-state branching process. A key property of a CSBP is that its Laplace transform has an exponential-affine structure with respect to the initial state. Let $v(x, z) = \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(-\\lambda Z_x) | Z_0 = z]$. The CSBP property implies that $v(x,z)$ must be of the form:\n$$\nv(x, z) = \\exp(-z \\cdot u(x, \\lambda))\n$$\nfor some function $u(x, \\lambda)$ that is independent of the initial state $z$.\n\nThe evolution of $v(x, z)$ with respect to the time-like variable $x$ is governed by the Kolmogorov backward equation, $\\partial_x v(x,z) = \\mathcal{A}v(x,z)$, where the generator $\\mathcal{A}$ acts on the state variable $z$. Using the explicit form of $\\mathcal{A}$ from Step 1, this equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x}(x,z) = 2z \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial z^2}(x,z)\n$$\nWe now substitute the CSBP ansatz $v(x, z) = \\exp(-z u(x, \\lambda))$ into this partial differential equation.\nThe left-hand side (LHS) is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\exp(-z u(x, \\lambda)) = \\exp(-z u(x, \\lambda)) \\cdot \\left(-z \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}(x, \\lambda)\\right)\n$$\nFor the right-hand side (RHS), we first compute the second partial derivative of $v$ with respect to $z$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial z} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\exp(-z u(x, \\lambda)) = -u(x, \\lambda) \\exp(-z u(x, \\lambda))\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial z^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z} \\left(-u(x, \\lambda) \\exp(-z u(x, \\lambda))\\right) = (-u(x, \\lambda))^2 \\exp(-z u(x, \\lambda)) = u(x, \\lambda)^2 \\exp(-z u(x, \\lambda))\n$$\nSubstituting this into the RHS of the Kolmogorov equation gives:\n$$\n2z \\frac{\\partial^2 v}{\\partial z^2}(x,z) = 2z \\cdot u(x, \\lambda)^2 \\exp(-z u(x, \\lambda))\n$$\nNow, we equate the LHS and RHS:\n$$\n-z \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}(x, \\lambda) \\exp(-z u(x, \\lambda)) = 2z u(x, \\lambda)^2 \\exp(-z u(x, \\lambda))\n$$\nFor $z  0$, we can divide both sides by $-z \\exp(-z u(x, \\lambda))$, which yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}(x, \\lambda) = -2 u(x, \\lambda)^2\n$$\nThe problem states that for a CSBP, $u(x, \\lambda)$ satisfies the differential equation $\\partial_x u(x, \\lambda) = -\\psi(u(x, \\lambda))$, where $\\psi$ is the branching mechanism. By comparing our derived equation with this general form, we can identify the branching mechanism. Letting $v = u(x,\\lambda)$, we have $\\psi(v) = 2v^2$. Therefore, the branching mechanism is:\n$$\n\\psi(\\lambda) = 2\\lambda^2\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Verification of the ODE and its initial condition**\n\nThe previous step derived the ordinary differential equation for $u(x, \\lambda)$ from first principles (the SDE for $Z_x$ and its CSBP structure), thereby verifying that $u$ solves $\\partial_x u = -\\psi(u)$ with $\\psi(\\lambda) = 2\\lambda^2$.\n\nNext, we must verify the initial condition $u(0, \\lambda) = \\lambda$. The function $u(x, \\lambda)$ is defined by the relation $\\mathbb{E}[\\exp(-\\lambda Z_x)] = \\exp(-\\ell u(x, \\lambda))$, given the specific starting value $Z_0 = \\ell$. Let us evaluate this relation at $x=0$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[\\exp(-\\lambda Z_0)] = \\exp(-\\ell u(0, \\lambda))\n$$\nSince $Z_0 = \\ell$ is a deterministic initial condition, the expectation on the LHS is simply $\\exp(-\\lambda \\ell)$.\n$$\n\\exp(-\\lambda \\ell) = \\exp(-\\ell u(0, \\lambda))\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides, we get:\n$$\n-\\lambda \\ell = -\\ell u(0, \\lambda)\n$$\nSince $\\ell  0$, we can divide by $-\\ell$ to obtain:\n$$\nu(0, \\lambda) = \\lambda\n$$\nThis verifies the initial condition. Thus, $u(x, \\lambda)$ is the solution to the initial value problem:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dx} = -2u^2, \\qquad u(0) = \\lambda\n$$\n\n**Step 4: Solution of the ordinary differential equation**\n\nThe ODE derived above is a first-order separable differential equation. We can solve it by separating variables and integrating. For $u \\neq 0$:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{u^2} = -2 dx\n$$\nWe integrate both sides, from the initial condition $(x=0, u=\\lambda)$ to a general point $(x, u(x, \\lambda))$:\n$$\n\\int_{\\lambda}^{u(x, \\lambda)} \\frac{1}{v^2} dv = \\int_{0}^{x} -2 ds\n$$\nThe integrals evaluate to:\n$$\n\\left[ -\\frac{1}{v} \\right]_{\\lambda}^{u(x, \\lambda)} = \\left[ -2s \\right]_{0}^{x}\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{u(x, \\lambda)} - \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\right) = -2x - 0\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{u(x, \\lambda)} + \\frac{1}{\\lambda} = -2x\n$$\nSolving for $u(x, \\lambda)$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{u(x, \\lambda)} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda} + 2x\n$$\nTo combine the terms on the right-hand side, we find a common denominator:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{u(x, \\lambda)} = \\frac{1 + 2x\\lambda}{\\lambda}\n$$\nFinally, taking the reciprocal of both sides gives the closed-form expression for $u(x, \\lambda)$:\n$$\nu(x, \\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda}{1 + 2x\\lambda}\n$$\nThis expression is the solution to the initial value problem and represents the log-Laplace exponent for the BESQ(0) process.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\lambda}{1 + 2x\\lambda}}$$", "id": "2993222"}]}
