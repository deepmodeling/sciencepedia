The derivation must be based on the provided foundational properties of Brownian motion and Tanaka's formula.\n\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the well-established theory of stochastic processes, is well-posed with a unique and meaningful solution, and is stated using objective, formal mathematical language.\n\nFirst, we will compute $\\mathbb{E}[|B_{t}|]$ by direct integration, using the given property that for a fixed time $t  0$, the random variable $B_{t}$ follows a Gaussian distribution with mean $0$ and variance $t$. This is denoted as $B_{t} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, t)$.\n\nThe probability density function (PDF) of $B_{t}$ is given by:\n$$p(x; t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{2}}{2t}\\right)$$\nThe expectation of $|B_{t}|$ is defined as the integral of $|x|$ weighted by this PDF over the entire real line:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[|B_{t}|] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |x| p(x; t) \\, \\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |x| \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{2}}{2t}\\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}x$$\nThe integrand $|x| \\exp(-\\frac{x^{2}}{2t})$ is an even function of $x$.

Let $u = \\frac{x^{2}}{2t}$. Then, the differential $\\mathrm{d}u$ is $\\mathrm{d}u = \\frac{2x}{2t} \\, \\mathrm{d}x = \\frac{x}{t} \\, \\mathrm{d}x$. This implies that $x \\, \\mathrm{d}x = t \\, \\mathrm{d}u$.

The formula simplifies to:\n$$|B_{t}| = \\int_{0}^{t} \\text{sgn}(B_{s}) \\, \\mathrm{d}B_{s} + L_{t}^{0}(B)$$\nNow, we take the expectation of both sides of this equation:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[|B_{t}|] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_{0}^{t} \\text{sgn}(B_{s}) \\, \\mathrm{d}B_{s}\\right] + \\mathbb{E}[L_{t}^{0}(B)]$$\nLet's analyze the expectation of the Itô integral term. The integrand is $\\phi_{s} = \\text{sgn}(B_{s})$. This process is progressively measurable because the filtration of $B_s$ is standard. Furthermore, it is a bounded process, since $|\\text{sgn}(B_{s})| \\leq 1$ for all $s \\geq 0$.

Tanaka's formula for the process $|B_t|$ is given by:\n$$|B_t| - |B_0| = \\int_0^t \\mathrm{sgn}(B_s) \\, dB_s + L_t^0$$\nGiven that $B_0=0$, the formula simplifies to:\n$$|B_t| = \\int_0^t \\mathrm{sgn}(B_s) \\, dB_s + L_t^0$$\nWe can find the expectation of $L_t^0$ by taking the expectation of both sides of this equation:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[|B_t|] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\int_0^t \\mathrm{sgn}(B_s) \\, dB_s\\right] + \\mathbb{E}[L_t^0]$$\nThe first term on the right-hand side is the expectation of an Itô stochastic integral. We must verify the conditions under which this expectation is zero. The integrand is $H_s = \\mathrm{sgn}(B_s)$. This process is adapted to the filtration generated by the Brownian motion. For the stochastic integral to be a martingale (and thus have zero expectation, as it starts at $0$), we must check the condition $\\mathbb{E}[\\int_0^t H_s^2 \\, ds]  \\infty$.\nThe square of the integrand is $(\\mathrm{sgn}(B_s))^2$. The set of times $\\{s \\in [0, t] : B_s = 0\\}$ has Lebesgue measure zero almost surely. For $B_s \\neq 0$, we have $(\\mathrm{sgn}(B_s))^2 = 1$.

The random variable $B_t$ follows a normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $t$, i.e., $B_t \\sim N(0, t)$. Its probability density function is $p(x, t) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2t}\\right)$.\nThe expectation of $|B_t|$ is:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[|B_t|] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} |x| \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2t}\\right) \\, dx$$\nSince the integrand is an even function of $x$, we can write:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[|B_t|] = 2 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} x \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi t}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2t}\\right) \\, dx$$\nWe perform a substitution with $u = \\frac{x^2}{2t}$, so $du = \\frac{x}{t} \\, dx$, which implies $x \\, dx = t \\, du$.

Formally, $L_t^0 = \\int_0^t \\delta_0(B_s) \\, ds$, where $\\delta_0$ is the Dirac delta function at $0$. Squaring this expression, we get:\n$$(L_t^0)^2 = \\left(\\int_0^t \\delta_0(B_s) \\, ds\\right) \\left(\\int_0^t \\delta_0(B_u) \\, du\\right) = \\int_0^t \\int_0^t \\delta_0(B_s) \\delta_0(B_u) \\, ds \\, du$$\nTaking the expectation and interchanging expectation and integration, which is justified by Fubini's theorem as the integrand is non-negative:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[(L_t^0)^2] = \\int_0^t \\int_0^t \\mathbb{E}[\\delta_0(B_s) \\delta_0(B_u)] \\, ds \\, du$$\nThe term $\\mathbb{E}[\\delta_0(B_s) \\delta_0(B_u)]$ represents the joint probability density of $(B_s, B_u)$ evaluated at $(0, 0)$. Let's assume without loss of generality that $0 \\le s  u \\le t$. The vector $(B_s, B_u)$ is a mean-zero Gaussian vector. Its covariance matrix $\\Sigma$ is:\n$$\\Sigma = \\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbb{E}[B_s^2]  \\mathbb{E}[B_s B_u] \\\\ \\mathbb{E}[B_u B_s]  \\mathbb{E}[B_u^2] \\end{pmatrix}$$\nWe have $\\mathbb{E}[B_s^2] = s$ and $\\mathbb{E}[B_u^2] = u$. The covariance is $\\mathbb{E}[B_s B_u] = \\mathbb{E}[B_s (B_s + (B_u - B_s))] = \\mathbb{E}[B_s^2] + \\mathbb{E}[B_s (B_u - B_s)]$. Due to the independence of increments, $\\mathbb{E}[B_s (B_u - B_s)] = \\mathbb{E}[B_s] \\mathbb{E}[B_u - B_s] = 0 \\cdot 0 = 0$. Thus, $\\mathbb{E}[B_s B_u] = s$.\nThe covariance matrix is $\\Sigma = \\begin{pmatrix} s  s \\\\ s  u \\end{pmatrix}$.\nThe determinant is $\\det(\\Sigma) = su - s^2 = s(u-s)$.\nThe joint density of a mean-zero bivariate normal distribution at $(0,0)$ is given by $p_{s,u}(0,0) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi \\sqrt{\\det(\\Sigma)}}$.\nSo, for $s  u$, we have $\\mathbb{E}[\\delta_0(B_s) \\delta_0(B_u)] = \\frac{1}{2\\pi \\sqrt{s(u-s)}}$.\nThe integral for the second moment becomes:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[(L_t^0)^2] = \\int_0^t \\int_0^t \\frac{1}{2\\pi \\sqrt{\\min(s,u)(\\max(s,u)-\\min(s,u))}} \\, ds \\, du$$\nDue to the symmetry of the integrand with respect to $s$ and $u$, we can write this as:\n$$\\mathbb{E}[(L_t^0)^2] = 2 \\int_0^t \\left( \\int_0^u \\frac{1}{2\\pi \\sqrt{s(u-s)}} \\, ds \\right) \\, du$$\nLet's evaluate the inner integral:\n$$I(u) = \\int_0^u \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{s(u-s)}} \\, ds = \\int_0^u \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{u^2 \\frac{s}{u}(1-\\frac{s}{u})}} \\, ds = \\frac{1}{u} \\int_0^u \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{s}{u}(1-\\frac{s}{u})}} \\, ds$$\nLet $y = s/u$, so $ds = u \\, dy$.

Therefore:\n$$\nda = \\left| \\frac{1}{\\phi'(\\phi^{-1}(b))} \\right| db = \\frac{1}{|\\phi'(\\phi^{-1}(b))|} db\n$$\nThe condition $\\inf_{x\\in\\mathbb{R}}|\\phi'(x)|  0$ ensures the denominator is never zero.\nSubstituting $a = \\phi^{-1}(b)$ and the expression for $da$ into the right-hand side integral:\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} g(b) \\left(\\phi'(\\phi^{-1}(b))\\right)^2 L_t^{\\phi^{-1}(b)}(X) \\frac{1}{|\\phi'(\\phi^{-1}(b))|} db\n$$\nWe can simplify the term multiplying the test function $g(b)$:\n$$\n\\frac{(\\phi'(\\phi^{-1}(b)))^2}{|\\phi'(\\phi^{-1}(b))|} = \\frac{|\\phi'(\\phi^{-1}(b))|^2}{|\\phi'(\\phi^{-1}(b))|} = |\\phi'(\\phi^{-1}(b))|\n$$\nSo the right-hand side becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} g(b) |\\phi'(\\phi^{-1}(b))| L_t^{\\phi^{-1}(b)}(X) db\n$$\nWe now have the final equality:\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathbb{R}} g(b) L_t^b(Y) db = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} g(b) |\\phi'(\\phi^{-1}(b))| L_t^{\\phi^{-1}(b)}(X) db\n$$\nThis identity must hold for every bounded Borel function $g$. By a standard result in measure theory, this implies that the integrands must be equal for almost every $b \\in \\mathbb{R}$ with respect to the Lebesgue measure. That is:\n$$\nL_t^b(Y) = |\\phi'(\\phi^{-1}(b))| L_t^{\\phi^{-1}(b)}(X) \\quad \\text{for a.e. } b \\in \\mathbb{R}\n$$\nFor a continuous semimartingale, the local time $L_t^a(X)$ is a continuous function of the spatial variable $a$. Therefore, the right-hand side of the equation, $|\\phi'(\\phi^{-1}(b))| L_t^{\\phi^{-1}(b)}(X)$, is a continuous function of $b$. This is because $\\phi^{-1}$ is continuous (as $\\phi$ is a diffeomorphism), $\\phi'$ is continuous, and $L_t^\\cdot(X)$ is continuous. The composition, product, and absolute value of continuous functions are continuous. The left-hand side, $L_t^b(Y)$, is also continuous in $b$. If two continuous functions are equal almost everywhere, they must be equal everywhere.\nThus, the equality holds for all $b \\in \\mathbb{R}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{|\\phi'(\\phi^{-1}(b))| L_t^{\\phi^{-1}(b)}(X)}\n$$", "id": "2999551"}]}
