It is scientifically grounded in the theory of stochastic processes, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard but non-trivial exercise in verifying the definitional properties of a Lévy process. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nOur objective is to construct a stochastic process $\\{X_t\\}_{t \\geq 0}$ that possesses independent increments but fails to have stationary increments, thus disqualifying it from being a Lévy process. We are instructed to base our construction on a standard Brownian motion.\n\nLet $\\{B_t\\}_{t \\geq 0}$ be a standard one-dimensional Brownian motion (also known as a Wiener process) defined on a filtered probability space $(\\Omega, \\mathcal{F}, \\{\\mathcal{F}_t\\}_{t \\geq 0}, \\mathbb{P})$. The defining properties of $\\{B_t\\}_{t \\geq 0}$ are:\n1.  $B_0 = 0$ almost surely.\n2.  The sample paths $t \\mapsto B_t(\\omega)$ are continuous for almost all $\\omega \\in \\Omega$.\n3.  For any $0 \\leq s  t$, the increment $B_t - B_s$ is a normally distributed random variable, $B_t - B_s \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, t-s)$.\n4.  For any sequence of times $0 \\leq t_1  t_2  \\dots  t_n$, the increments $B_{t_2} - B_{t_1}, B_{t_3} - B_{t_2}, \\dots, B_{t_n} - B_{t_{n-1}}$ are mutually independent random variables.\n\nFrom these properties, it follows that a standard Brownian motion is a Lévy process. Specifically, the distribution of an increment $B_t - B_s$ depends only on the time difference $t-s$, satisfying the stationary increments property.\n\nTo construct a process that lacks stationary increments, we can introduce a non-linear time-scaling to the Brownian motion. Let us define the process $\\{X_t\\}_{t \\geq 0}$ as:\n$$X_t = B_{t^2}$$\nWe will now verify the properties of this process with respect to the definition of a Lévy process.\n\n1.  **Initial Condition**:\n    At time $t=0$, we have $X_0 = B_{0^2} = B_0$. By the definition of Brownian motion, $B_0 = 0$ almost surely. Thus, $X_0 = 0$ a.s.\n\n2.  **Stochastic Continuity**:\n    A process with almost surely continuous sample paths is stochastically continuous. The mapping $t \\mapsto t^2$ is continuous. Since the sample paths of a Brownian motion $t \\mapsto B_t$ are almost surely continuous, the composition $t \\mapsto B_{t^2}$ results in almost surely continuous paths for $X_t$. Therefore, $\\{X_t\\}_{t \\geq 0}$ is stochastically continuous.\n\n3.  **Independent Increments**:\n    Consider any sequence of times $0 \\leq t_1  t_2  \\dots  t_n$. The corresponding increments of the process $X_t$ are:\n    $$X_{t_{k+1}} - X_{t_k} = B_{t_{k+1}^2} - B_{t_k^2}$$\n    for $k=1, 2, \\dots, n-1$. Since the function $f(t) = t^2$ is strictly increasing for $t \\geq 0$, the condition $t_1  t_2  \\dots  t_n$ implies $t_1^2  t_2^2  \\dots  t_n^2$.\n    The time intervals for the underlying Brownian motion, $[t_1^2, t_2^2), [t_2^2, t_3^2), \\dots, [t_{n-1}^2, t_n^2)$, are non-overlapping.\n    By property $4$ of Brownian motion, increments over non-overlapping time intervals are independent. Therefore, the random variables $B_{t_2^2} - B_{t_1^2}, B_{t_3^2} - B_{t_2^2}, \\dots, B_{t_n^2} - B_{t_{n-1}^2}$ are mutually independent. This establishes that the process $\\{X_t\\}_{t \\geq 0}$ has independent increments.\n\n4.  **Stationary Increments**:\n    This is the property we hypothesize will fail. The stationary increments property requires that the distribution of an increment $X_t - X_s$ depends only on the time difference $t-s$. Let us analyze the distribution of a generic increment $X_t - X_s$ for $0 \\leq s  t$.\n    The increment is given by $X_t - X_s = B_{t^2} - B_{s^2}$.\n    From the properties of Brownian motion, the increment $B_{t^2} - B_{s^2}$ is normally distributed with mean $0$ and variance equal to the length of the time interval, which is $t^2 - s^2$.\n    So, $X_t - X_s \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, t^2 - s^2)$.\n    The distribution of the increment clearly depends on both $s$ and $t$, not just on the difference $t-s$. To demonstrate this explicitly, let us compare two increments of the same duration $\\tau  0$, but starting at different times.\n    -   Consider the increment from time $0$ to $\\tau$: $X_\\tau - X_0 = X_\\tau$. Its distribution is $\\mathcal{N}(0, \\tau^2 - 0^2) = \\mathcal{N}(0, \\tau^2)$.\n    -   Consider the increment from time $s  0$ to $s+\\tau$: $X_{s+\\tau} - X_s$. Its distribution is $\\mathcal{N}(0, (s+\\tau)^2 - s^2) = \\mathcal{N}(0, 2s\\tau + \\tau^2)$.\n    Since the variances $\\tau^2$ and $2s\\tau + \\tau^2$ are not equal for any $s  0$, the distributions are different. For example, $X_1 - X_0 \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ while $X_2 - X_1 \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 3)$. The increments are not stationary.\n\nFinally, we derive the characteristic function of the increment $X_t - X_s$. The characteristic function of a random variable $Y$ is defined as $\\phi_Y(u) = \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(iuY)]$ for a real argument $u$.\nFor a normally distributed random variable $Y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$, the characteristic function is given by the well-known formula $\\phi_Y(u) = \\exp(i\\mu u - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma^2 u^2)$.\nIn our case, the increment is $Y = X_t - X_s$, which follows a normal distribution with mean $\\mu = 0$ and variance $\\sigma^2 = t^2 - s^2$.\nSubstituting these values into the formula, we obtain the characteristic function for the increment $X_t - X_s$:\n$$\\phi_{X_t - X_s}(u) = \\exp\\left(i(0)u - \\frac{1}{2}(t^2 - s^2)u^2\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}(t^2 - s^2)u^2\\right)$$\nThis expression explicitly shows the breakdown of stationarity. If the increments were stationary, this function would depend only on the duration $\\tau = t-s$. However, we can write $t^2 - s^2 = (t-s)(t+s) = \\tau(2s+\\tau)$, which manifestly depends on the starting time $s$ in addition to the duration $\\tau$. This confirms that $\\{X_t=B_{t^2}\\}_{t \\geq 0}$ is not a Lévy process.\nThe requested final answer is the derived closed-form expression for this characteristic function.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}(t^{2} - s^{2})u^{2}\\right)}$$", "id": "2984412"}, {"introduction": "The Lévy-Schoenberg theorem provides a crucial link between the analytical properties of a function and its ability to be a characteristic exponent.

Therefore, the function $-\\Psi(\\xi) = -|\\xi|^{2}$ is not a continuous negative definite function, which means $\\Psi(\\xi)$ cannot be a characteristic exponent.\n\n**2. Incompatibility with being a Characteristic Exponent**\n\nFor a function $\\Psi$ to be the characteristic exponent of a Lévy process, the function $\\phi_{t}(\\xi) = \\exp(t \\Psi(\\xi))$ must be the characteristic function of a probability measure for all $t > 0$. A fundamental property of any characteristic function is that its modulus must be bounded by $1$, i.e., $|\\phi_{t}(\\xi)| \\leq 1$ for all $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$.\n\nLet's test this condition for our chosen function $\\Psi(\\xi) = |\\xi|^{2}$.\nThe candidate characteristic function is:\n$$\n\\phi_{t}(\\xi) = \\exp(t \\Psi(\\xi)) = \\exp(t|\\xi|^{2}).\n$$\nWe examine its modulus. Since $t$ and $|\\xi|^2$ are real, the expression is real and positive.\n$$\n|\\phi_{t}(\\xi)| = |\\exp(t|\\xi|^{2})| = \\exp(t|\\xi|^{2}).\n$$\nThe condition $|\\phi_{t}(\\xi)| \\leq 1$ translates to $\\exp(t|\\xi|^{2}) \\leq 1$. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides (which is a strictly increasing function), we get:\n$$\nt|\\xi|^{2} \\leq \\ln(1) = 0.\n$$\nThis inequality must hold for all $t > 0$ and all $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$. However, if we choose any $t > 0$ and any non-zero vector $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ (e.g., $\\xi$ is the vector with first component $1$ and others $0$), the product $t|\\xi|^{2}$ is strictly positive. For instance, for $t=1$ and any $\\xi \\ne 0$, we have $|\\phi_{1}(\\xi)| = \\exp(|\\xi|^2) > 1$.\n\nThis violates a critical property of characteristic functions. Thus, $\\exp(t|\\xi|^2)$ cannot represent the characteristic function of any probability measure for any $t>0$, and consequently, $\\Psi(\\xi) = |\\xi|^{2}$ cannot be a characteristic exponent.\n\n**3. Incompatibility with being a Generator Symbol**\n\nThe infinitesimal generator $A$ of a Lévy process corresponds to a Feller semigroup, which is a strongly continuous contraction semigroup on a suitable function space, such as $L^{2}(\\mathbb{R}^{d})$. A necessary condition for an operator to generate a contraction semigroup on a Hilbert space is that its numerical range must lie in the left half-plane. For a Fourier multiplier operator like $A$, with symbol $\\Psi(\\xi)$, this condition translates to $\\text{Re}(\\Psi(\\xi)) \\leq 0$ for almost every $\\xi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$. This ensures the operator is dissipative.\n\nLet's check this condition for our chosen function $\\Psi(\\xi) = |\\xi|^2$. The generator's symbol is $\\Psi(\\xi)$ itself.\nThe condition becomes:\n$$\n\\text{Re}(\\Psi(\\xi)) \\leq 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad |\\xi|^2 \\leq 0.\n$$\nThis inequality is only satisfied at the single point $\\xi = 0$. For any $\\xi \\neq 0$, we have $\\text{Re}(\\Psi(\\xi)) = |\\xi|^2 > 0$, which violates the condition. The corresponding operator is the Laplacian, $A=\\Delta$, whose spectrum on $L^2(\\mathbb{R}^d)$ is $(-\\infty, 0]$. Wait, the symbol of the Laplacian $\\Delta$ is $-|\\xi|^2$. Our operator has symbol $|\\xi|^2$, so it is the negative Laplacian, $A = -\\Delta$, whose spectrum is $[0, \\infty)$. An operator is dissipative if and only if its numerical range is in the left half-plane, which for a self-adjoint operator like $-\\Delta$ means its spectrum must be in $(-\\infty, 0]$. This is clearly not the case.\n\nSince the operator with symbol $\\Psi(\\xi)=|\\xi|^2$ is not dissipative, it cannot be the generator of a Feller semigroup, and $\\Psi(\\xi) = |\\xi|^2$ cannot be a characteristic exponent.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{|\\xi|^2}\n$$", "id": "2984431"}, {"introduction": "The characteristic exponent is not just an abstract descriptor; it is a powerful tool for concrete calculations.

This translates to a condition on the real part of the characteristic exponent, since $|\\phi_{X_t}(\\xi)| = |\\exp(t \\Psi(\\xi))| = \\exp(\\text{Re}(t \\Psi(\\xi))) = \\exp(t \\cdot \\text{Re}(\\Psi(\\xi)))$.\n    \n    **Condition 1:** The function $\\xi \\mapsto \\exp(t \\cdot \\text{Re}(\\Psi(\\xi)))$ must be in $L^1(\\mathbb{R}^d)$ for all $t > 0$. That is, for every $t0$, the integral $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^d} \\exp(t \\cdot \\text{Re}(\\Psi(\\xi))) \\, d\\xi$ must be finite.\n\n2.  **Sufficient Condition for Infinite Differentiability:**\n    For the transition density $p_t(\\cdot)$ to be infinitely differentiable ($C^\\infty$), we can differentiate under the integral sign. The $\\alpha$-th partial derivative of $p_t(x)$ with respect to a multi-index $\\alpha = (\\alpha_1, \\dots, \\alpha_d)$ is given by the inverse Fourier transform of $(-i\\xi)^{\\alpha} \\phi_{X_t}(\\xi)$. For this to be well-defined and continuous for all $\\alpha$, the function $\\xi \\mapsto \\xi^{\\alpha} \\phi_{X_t}(\\xi)$ must be in $L^1(\\mathbb{R}^d)$ for every multi-index $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{N}_0^d$. This requires that the characteristic function decays faster than any polynomial as $|\\xi| \\to \\infty$.\n\n    **Condition 2:** For every multi-index $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{N}_0^d$ and for every $t0$, the function $\\xi \\mapsto \\xi^{\\alpha} \\exp(t \\Psi(\\xi))$ must be in $L^1(\\mathbb{R}^d)$. That is, the integral $\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^d} |\\xi^{\\alpha}| \\exp(t \\cdot \\text{Re}(\\Psi(\\xi))) \\, d\\xi$ must be finite.\n\nThese two conditions provide a direct link between the analytical properties of the characteristic exponent and the regularity of the transition density.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{t}{\\pi(x^2 + t^2)}}\n$$", "id": "2984425"}]}
