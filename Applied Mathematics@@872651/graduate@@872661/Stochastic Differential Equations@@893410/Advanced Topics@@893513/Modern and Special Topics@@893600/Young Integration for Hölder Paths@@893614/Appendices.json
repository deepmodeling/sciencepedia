It poses a standard, verifiable question within the mathematical theory of integration for non-smooth paths.

We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the computation of the integral $I = \\int_0^1 t^{\\beta}\\, d\\big(t^{\\alpha}\\big)$ for paths $f(t) = t^{\\beta}$ and $g(t) = t^{\\alpha}$ on the interval $[0,1]$, under the conditions $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$, $\\beta \\in (0,1)$, and $\\alpha + \\beta  1$. We will compute this integral using two distinct methodologies as requested.\n\n**Method 1: Computation using Classical Calculus (Riemann-Stieltjes Integral)**\n\nThe integral in question is a Riemann-Stieltjes integral, $\\int_0^1 f(t) dg(t)$, with the integrand $f(t) = t^{\\beta}$ and the integrator $g(t) = t^{\\alpha}$.\n\nA fundamental theorem of Riemann-Stieltjes integration states that if the integrator $g$ is absolutely continuous on $[a,b]$, then the Riemann-Stieltjes integral exists and can be computed as a standard Riemann integral:\n$$\n\\int_a^b f(t) dg(t) = \\int_a^b f(t) g'(t) dt\n$$\nwhere $g'(t)$ is the derivative of $g(t)$.\n\nWe must first establish that the integrator $g(t) = t^{\\alpha}$ is absolutely continuous on the interval $[0,1]$ for $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$. A function is absolutely continuous on a compact interval if its derivative exists almost everywhere, is Lebesgue integrable, and the function can be recovered from its derivative by integration.\n\nThe derivative of $g(t) = t^{\\alpha}$ is $g'(t) = \\alpha t^{\\alpha-1}$, which is defined for $t \\in (0,1]$. We check for its integrability on $[0,1]$:\n$$\n\\int_0^1 |g'(t)| dt = \\int_0^1 |\\alpha t^{\\alpha-1}| dt = \\alpha \\int_0^1 t^{\\alpha-1} dt\n$$\nSince $\\alpha  0$, the constant $\\alpha$ is positive. The integral is an improper integral at $t=0$. It converges if and only if the exponent $\\alpha-1$ is greater than $-1$, which means $\\alpha  0$. This condition is satisfied, as the problem states $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$.\nEvaluating the integral gives:\n$$\n\\alpha \\left[ \\frac{t^{\\alpha}}{\\alpha} \\right]_0^1 = [t^{\\alpha}]_0^1 = 1^{\\alpha} - 0^{\\alpha} = 1\n$$\nSince the derivative $g'(t)$ is integrable on $[0,1]$, the function $g(t) = t^{\\alpha}$ is absolutely continuous on $[0,1]$.\n\nWe can now convert the Riemann-Stieltjes integral into a Riemann integral:\n$$\nI = \\int_0^1 t^{\\beta} d(t^{\\alpha}) = \\int_0^1 t^{\\beta} (\\alpha t^{\\alpha-1}) dt = \\alpha \\int_0^1 t^{\\alpha + \\beta - 1} dt\n$$\nThis is an improper Riemann integral. It converges if the exponent $\\alpha + \\beta - 1$ is greater than $-1$, which requires $\\alpha + \\beta  0$. Since $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$ and $\\beta \\in (0,1)$, this condition is met. We can evaluate the integral:\n$$\nI = \\alpha \\left[ \\frac{t^{\\alpha+\\beta}}{\\alpha+\\beta} \\right]_0^1\n$$\nThe problem specifies that $\\alpha + \\beta  1$, which implies $\\alpha + \\beta  0$. Therefore, substituting the limits of integration yields:\n$$\nI = \\alpha \\left( \\frac{1^{\\alpha+\\beta}}{\\alpha+\\beta} - \\frac{0^{\\alpha+\\beta}}{\\alpha+\\beta} \\right) = \\alpha \\left( \\frac{1}{\\alpha+\\beta} - 0 \\right) = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}\n$$\n\n**Method 2: Computation using Young Integration**\n\nThe theory of Young integration provides a framework for integrating a path $f$ with respect to a path $g$ provided they have sufficient regularity, measured by their Hölder exponents. The integral is defined if $f$ is $\\gamma_1$-Hölder continuous and $g$ is $\\gamma_2$-Hölder continuous with $\\gamma_1 + \\gamma_2  1$.\n\nFirst, we must verify that $f(t) = t^{\\beta}$ is $\\beta$-Hölder continuous and $g(t) = t^{\\alpha}$ is $\\alpha$-Hölder continuous for $\\alpha, \\beta \\in (0,1)$. For any exponent $\\gamma \\in (0,1)$, the function $h(t) = t^{\\gamma}$ is concave on $[0, \\infty)$. A property of concave functions is that for any $s, t$ in their domain with $s  t$, we have $h(t) - h(s) \\le h(t-s) - h(0)$. Applied to $h(t)=t^\\gamma$ on $[0,1]$, for $0 \\le s  t \\le 1$, this gives:\n$$\nt^{\\gamma} - s^{\\gamma} \\le (t-s)^{\\gamma}\n$$\nSince both sides are non-negative, we have $|t^{\\gamma} - s^{\\gamma}| \\le |t-s|^{\\gamma}$. This confirms that $t^{\\gamma}$ is $\\gamma$-Hölder continuous (with a Hölder constant $C=1$). Thus, $f(t)=t^{\\beta}$ is $\\beta$-Hölder continuous, and $g(t)=t^{\\alpha}$ is $\\alpha$-Hölder continuous.\n\nThe problem states that $\\alpha + \\beta  1$, which is precisely the condition required for the existence of the Young integral $\\int_0^1 f dg$.\n\nA central theorem connecting Young integration to classical integration, stated in the problem, is that the Young integral coincides with the Riemann-Stieltjes integral if the integrator $g$ has bounded variation. A function has bounded variation if its total variation is finite. As shown in Method 1, the total variation of $g(t)=t^{\\alpha}$ on $[0,1]$ is:\n$$\nV_0^1(g) = \\int_0^1 |g'(t)| dt = 1\n$$\nSince the total variation is finite ($1  \\infty$), the function $g(t) = t^{\\alpha}$ is of bounded variation on $[0,1]$.\n\nBy this theorem, the value of the Young integral is identical to the value of the Riemann-Stieltjes integral:\n$$\n\\int_0^1 t^{\\beta} d(t^{\\alpha}) \\quad (\\text{Young}) \\quad = \\quad \\int_0^1 t^{\\beta} d(t^{\\alpha}) \\quad (\\text{Riemann-Stieltjes})\n$$\nThe computation of the Riemann-Stieltjes integral has already been performed in Method 1. Therefore, the value obtained is the same.\n$$\nI = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}\n$$\n\n**Explanation of Agreement**\n\nThe two methods yield the same result not by coincidence, but as a direct consequence of the underlying mathematical structure. The agreement is guaranteed by a consistency theorem between the two theories of integration.\n\nThe integrator function $g(t) = t^{\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$ is sufficiently \"regular\" or \"smooth\" to be handled by classical theories. Specifically, it is absolutely continuous, and therefore of bounded variation. This regularity allows the Riemann-Stieltjes integral $\\int_0^1 f dg$ to be defined and computed as a standard Riemann integral $\\int_0^1 f g' dt$, which is the essence of Method 1.\n\nSimultaneously, the integrator $g(t) = t^{\\alpha}$ and the integrand $f(t) = t^{\\beta}$ satisfy the Hölder continuity conditions ($\\alpha$-Hölder and $\\beta$-Hölder, respectively) with $\\alpha+\\beta1$. This places them in the domain of Young's integration theory, a more general framework designed to handle paths that are too \"rough\" for Riemann-Stieltjes integration (i.e., not of bounded variation).\n\nThe core of the matter is that the domain of Riemann-Stieltjes integration (for integrators of bounded variation) is a subset of the domain of Young integration. Foundational theorems in this area prove that when an integral is defined under both theories (as is the case here), their values must coincide. Method 2 is an application of this principle: we identify that the problem satisfies the conditions for both theories and invoke the theorem that guarantees their equivalence, thereby reducing the problem to the calculation already performed in Method 1. The condition $\\alpha + \\beta  1$ is crucial for validating the problem within the Young framework, even though the integral could have been computed via Riemann-Stieltjes without it (since $\\alpha+\\beta0$ is sufficient for the final Riemann integral to converge).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}}\n$$", "id": "3006466"}, {"introduction": "Having confirmed the consistency of Young integration, we now investigate the necessity of its core condition, $\\alpha+\\beta \\gt 1$.

For each $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, the term $f_n(t) = 2^{-n/2}\\cos(2^n t)$ is continuous on $\\mathbb{R}$. Its maximum absolute value is $M_n = \\|f_n\\|_\\infty = 2^{-n/2}$. The series of these maximums is a geometric series:\n$$\n\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} M_n = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} 2^{-n/2} = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^n.\n$$\nSince the ratio $1/\\sqrt{2}$ is less than $1$, this series converges. By the Weierstrass M-test, the series for $f(t)$ converges absolutely and uniformly on $\\mathbb{R}$, and thus on $[0, 2\\pi]$. Since uniform convergence of a series of continuous functions preserves continuity, the limit function $f(t)$ is continuous. The exact same argument applies to $g(t)$, since $|\\sin(2^n t)| \\le 1$. Therefore, both $f$ and $g$ are well-defined and continuous on $[0, 2\\pi]$.\n\n**Hölder Continuity with exponent $\\gamma=1/2$:**\nWe need to show there exists a constant $C0$ such that for all $s,t \\in [0, 2\\pi]$, $|f(t)-f(s)| \\le C|t-s|^{1/2}$. Let $h = |t-s|0$. We choose an integer $K \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $2^{-K} \\le h  2^{-K+1}$. We split the sum for $f(t)-f(s)$ into two parts, corresponding to low and high frequencies relative to $K$:\n$$\nf(t)-f(s) = \\sum_{n=1}^{K-1} 2^{-n/2}(\\cos(2^n t) - \\cos(2^n s)) + \\sum_{n=K}^{\\infty} 2^{-n/2}(\\cos(2^n t) - \\cos(2^n s)).\n$$\nFor the low-frequency part ($n  K$), we use the Mean Value Theorem: $|\\cos(x)-\\cos(y)| \\le |x-y|$.\n$$\n\\left| \\sum_{n=1}^{K-1} 2^{-n/2}(\\cos(2^n t) - \\cos(2^n s)) \\right| \\le \\sum_{n=1}^{K-1} 2^{-n/2} |2^n t - 2^n s| = h \\sum_{n=1}^{K-1} 2^{n/2}.\n$$\nThis is a geometric sum:\n$$\nh \\sum_{n=1}^{K-1} 2^{n/2} = h \\frac{2^{1/2}(2^{(K-1)/2}-1)}{2^{1/2}-1}  \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}-1} h \\, 2^{(K-1)/2}.\n$$\nFrom our choice of $K$, $h  2^{-K+1}$, which implies $2^{(K-1)/2}  h^{-1/2}$. Thus,\n$$\nh \\sum_{n=1}^{K-1} 2^{n/2}  \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}-1} h h^{-1/2} = C_1 h^{1/2}.\n$$\nFor the high-frequency part ($n \\ge K$), we use the bound $|\\cos(x)-\\cos(y)| \\le 2$.\n$$\n\\left| \\sum_{n=K}^{\\infty} 2^{-n/2}(\\cos(2^n t) - \\cos(2^n s)) \\right| \\le \\sum_{n=K}^{\\infty} 2^{-n/2} \\cdot 2 = 2 \\sum_{n=K}^{\\infty} (2^{-1/2})^n.\n$$\nThis is another geometric sum:\n$$\n2 \\frac{(2^{-1/2})^K}{1-2^{-1/2}} = C_2 \\, 2^{-K/2}.\n$$\nFrom our choice of $K$, $2^{-K} \\le h$, which implies $2^{-K/2} \\le h^{1/2}$. Thus, the high-frequency part is bounded by $C_2 h^{1/2}$.\nCombining the two bounds, we get $|f(t)-f(s)| \\le (C_1+C_2)|t-s|^{1/2}$. This proves that $f$ is Hölder continuous with exponent $1/2$. The argument for $g(t)$ is identical, using $|\\sin(x)-\\sin(y)| \\le |x-y|$ and $|\\sin(x)-\\sin(y)| \\le 2$.\n\n### Part 2: Explicit Expression for the Riemann-Stieltjes Sums\n\nLet $\\pi^{(m)} = \\{t_i = i \\frac{2\\pi}{2^m} : i=0, \\dots, 2^m\\}$. The Riemann-Stieltjes sum is\n$$\nS_m = S_{\\pi^{(m)}}(f,g) = \\sum_{i=0}^{2^m-1} f(t_i) (g(t_{i+1}) - g(t_i)).\n$$\nWe can write this as $S_m = \\sum_{i=0}^{2^m-1} f(t_i) g(t_{i+1}) - \\sum_{i=0}^{2^m-1} f(t_i) g(t_i)$.\nLet's analyze the second term, which we call $B_m$:\n$$\nB_m = \\sum_{i=0}^{2^m-1} f(t_i)g(t_i) = \\sum_{i=0}^{2^m-1} \\left(\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} 2^{-n/2}\\cos(2^n t_i)\\right) \\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} 2^{-k/2}\\sin(2^k t_i)\\right).\n$$\nDue to uniform convergence, we can swap the summation order:\n$$\nB_m = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} 2^{-(n+k)/2} \\sum_{i=0}^{2^m-1} \\cos(2^n t_i) \\sin(2^k t_i).\n$$\nThe inner sum over $i$ is identically zero. To see this, let $\\phi_{n,k}(i) = \\cos(2^n i \\frac{2\\pi}{2^m}) \\sin(2^k i \\frac{2\\pi}{2^m})$. The function $\\phi_{n,k}(i)$ is zero for $i=0$ (since $\\sin(0)=0$). For $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, 2^m-1\\}$, the argument of the trigonometric functions is $2\\pi$ times a rational number. We observe that $\\cos(2^n(2^m-i)\\frac{2\\pi}{2^m}) = \\cos(2^n(2\\pi - i\\frac{2\\pi}{2^m})) = \\cos(-2^n i\\frac{2\\pi}{2^m}) = \\cos(2^n i\\frac{2\\pi}{2^m})$, whereas $\\sin(2^k(2^m-i)\\frac{2\\pi}{2^m}) = \\sin(-2^k i\\frac{2\\pi}{2^m}) = -\\sin(2^k i\\frac{2\\pi}{2^m})$. Therefore, $\\phi_{n,k}(2^m-i) = -\\phi_{n,k}(i)$. The sum $\\sum_{i=1}^{2^m-1} \\phi_{n,k}(i)$ consists of pairs that cancel out. If $2^m$ is even, the term $i=2^{m-1}$ is its own pair; for this index, $t_{2^{m-1}}=\\pi$, and $\\sin(2^k \\pi)=0$ for $k\\ge 1$, so this term is zero. Thus, the entire sum over $i$ is zero, and $B_m = 0$.\n\nNow we are left with $S_m = \\sum_{i=0}^{2^m-1} f(t_i) g(t_{i+1})$. Let $\\Delta t = 2\\pi/2^m$.\n$$\nS_m = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} 2^{-(n+k)/2} \\sum_{i=0}^{2^m-1} \\cos(2^n t_i) \\sin(2^k t_{i+1}).\n$$\nLet's analyze the inner sum $C_{n,k} = \\sum_{i=0}^{2^m-1} \\cos(2^n i \\Delta t) \\sin(2^k (i+1) \\Delta t)$.\nUsing $\\sin(A+B) = \\sin A \\cos B + \\cos A \\sin B$:\n$$\nC_{n,k} = \\sum_{i=0}^{2^m-1} \\cos(2^n i \\Delta t) [\\sin(2^k i \\Delta t)\\cos(2^k \\Delta t) + \\cos(2^k i \\Delta t)\\sin(2^k \\Delta t)].\n$$\n$$\nC_{n,k} = \\cos(2^k \\Delta t) \\sum_{i=0}^{2^m-1} \\cos(2^n i \\Delta t)\\sin(2^k i \\Delta t) + \\sin(2^k \\Delta t) \\sum_{i=0}^{2^m-1} \\cos(2^n i \\Delta t)\\cos(2^k i \\Delta t).\n$$\nThe first sum over $i$ is zero by the same symmetry argument as for $B_m$. So we only have the second term:\n$$\nC_{n,k} = \\sin(2^k \\Delta t) \\sum_{i=0}^{2^m-1} \\cos(2^n i \\frac{2\\pi}{2^m})\\cos(2^k i \\frac{2\\pi}{2^m}).\n$$\nThis is a standard orthogonality relation for discrete cosine sums. The sum is non-zero only if $2^n \\equiv \\pm 2^k \\pmod{2^m}$.\nLet's assume $n,k  m$. If $k  n  m$, then $2^m$ cannot divide $2^n \\pm 2^k = 2^k(2^{n-k} \\pm 1)$ since $km$ and $2^{n-k} \\pm 1$ is odd. So the sum is zero for $n \\ne k$.\nTherefore, the only non-zero contributions to $S_m$ for $n,km$ come from diagonal terms where $n=k$.\nFor $n=k$:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=0}^{2^m-1} \\cos^2(2^n i \\Delta t) = \\sum_{i=0}^{2^m-1} \\frac{1+\\cos(2^{n+1} i \\Delta t)}{2} = \\frac{2^m}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=0}^{2^m-1} \\cos(2^{n+1} i \\frac{2\\pi}{2^m}).\n$$\nThe second sum is zero unless $2^{n+1}$ is a multiple of $2^m$, i.e., $n+1 \\ge m$.\n- If $n  m-1$: The sum is $2^m/2$.\n- If $n = m-1$: $2^{n+1}=2^m$, the argument of cosine is $2\\pi i$, so $\\cos(2\\pi i) = 1$. The sum is $2^m$. Total sum becomes $2^m/2 + 2^m/2 = 2^m$.\n- If $n \\ge m$: $2^{n+1}$ is a multiple of $2^m$. The sum is $2^m$ as well.\n\nNow we compute the total sum $S_m = \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} 2^{-n} C_{n,n}$.\n- For $n  m-1$: Contribution is $2^{-n} \\sin(2^n \\Delta t) \\frac{2^m}{2} = 2^{-n} 2^{m-1} \\sin(2\\pi / 2^{m-n})$.\n- For $n = m-1$: The cosine sum is $2^m$. $C_{m-1,m-1} = \\sin(2^{m-1} \\Delta t) \\cdot 2^m = \\sin(\\pi) \\cdot 2^m = 0$. Contribution is zero.\n- For $n \\ge m$: The cosine sum is $2^m$. $C_{n,n} = \\sin(2^n \\Delta t) \\cdot 2^m = \\sin(2^{n-m} 2\\pi) \\cdot 2^m = 0$. Contribution is zero.\n\nThus, only terms with $n \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, m-2\\}$ contribute.\n$$\nS_m = \\sum_{n=1}^{m-1} 2^{-n} 2^{m-1} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{2^{m-n}}\\right).\n$$\nTo simplify, let $j = m-n$. As $n$ runs from $1$ to $m-1$, $j$ runs from $m-1$ down to $1$.\n$$\nS_m = \\sum_{j=1}^{m-1} 2^{-(m-j)} 2^{m-1} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{2^j}\\right) = \\sum_{j=1}^{m-1} 2^{j-1} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{2^j}\\right).\n$$\nSince the term for $j=1$ is $2^0 \\sin(\\pi)=0$, we can start the sum from $j=2$:\n$$\nS_m = \\sum_{j=2}^{m-1} 2^{j-1} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{2^j}\\right).\n$$\nThis is the explicit expression for $S_m$.\n\n### Part 3: Asymptotic Behavior and Limit\n\nWe have $S_m = \\sum_{j=2}^{m-1} a_j$, where $a_j = 2^{j-1} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{2^j}\\right)$.\nFor large $j$, we have the Taylor expansion $\\sin(x) = x - x^3/6 + O(x^5)$.\n$$\na_j = 2^{j-1} \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{2^j} - O\\left(\\left(\\frac{1}{2^j}\\right)^3\\right) \\right) = \\pi - O\\left(\\frac{1}{2^{2j}}\\right).\n$$\nSo, $\\lim_{j\\to\\infty} a_j = \\pi$.

For any $h \\in (0, 1]$, there exists a unique integer $N \\ge 1$ such that $2^{-N} \\le h  2^{-N+1}$. We split the sum into two parts: $n  N$ and $n \\ge N$.\n\nFor the terms with $n  N$:\nWe use the Lipschitz property of $\\phi$:\n$$|\\phi(2^n t) - \\phi(2^n s)| \\le |2^n t - 2^n s| = 2^n(t-s) = 2^n h$$\nThe sum for $n=0, \\dots, N-1$ is bounded by:\n$$ \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} 2^{-n/2} (2^n h) = h \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} (2^{1/2})^n = h \\frac{(2^{1/2})^N-1}{2^{1/2}-1} = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2}-1} (2^{N/2}-1) $$\nSince $h  2^{-N+1}$, we have $2^N  2/h$, which implies $2^{N/2}  \\sqrt{2/h}$.\nThe sum is therefore bounded by:\n$$ \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2}-1} (\\sqrt{2/h}-1) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}-1}\\sqrt{h} - \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2}-1} \\le \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}-1}\\sqrt{h} $$\n\nFor the terms with $n \\ge N$:\nWe use the property that $\\phi(u)$ is bounded by $1/2$, so $|\\phi(u_1)-\\phi(u_2)| \\le |\\phi(u_1)| + |\\phi(u_2)| \\le 1/2 + 1/2 = 1$.\nThe sum for $n=N, \\dots, \\infty$ is bounded by:\n$$ \\sum_{n=N}^{\\infty} 2^{-n/2} \\cdot 1 = \\sum_{n=N}^{\\infty} (2^{-1/2})^n $$\nThis is a geometric series with ratio $2^{-1/2}  1$.

Thus, $f(t)$ is $1/2$-Hölder continuous.\n\n### (ii) Computation of the Limit of the Quadratic Variation\n\nWe need to compute the limit of $V_{2}(f,\\mathcal{P}_{m}) = \\sum_{k=0}^{2^{m}-1}\\bigl(f(t_{k+1})-f(t_{k})\\bigr)^{2}$ as $m\\to\\infty$, where $t_k = k 2^{-m}$.\n\nLet $\\Delta_k f = f(t_{k+1}) - f(t_{k})$. The increment is over an interval of length $2^{-m}$.\n$$ \\Delta_k f = f((k+1)2^{-m}) - f(k 2^{-m}) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} 2^{-n/2} \\left[ \\phi(2^n (k+1)2^{-m}) - \\phi(2^n k 2^{-m}) \\right] $$\nFor $n \\ge m$, the argument of $\\phi$ is $2^{n-m}(k+1)$ or $2^{n-m}k$. Both are integers. Since $\\phi(j)=0$ for any integer $j$, the terms in the sum for $n \\ge m$ are zero.\nThe sum for $\\Delta_k f$ is therefore finite:\n$$ \\Delta_k f = \\sum_{n=0}^{m-1} 2^{-n/2} \\left[ \\phi(2^{n-m}(k+1)) - \\phi(2^{n-m}k) \\right] $$\nLet us denote $d_n(k) = \\phi(2^{n-m}(k+1)) - \\phi(2^{n-m}k)$. Then $\\Delta_k f = \\sum_{n=0}^{m-1} 2^{-n/2} d_n(k)$.\nThe quadratic variation is:\n$$ V_2(f, \\mathcal{P}_m) = \\sum_{k=0}^{2^m-1} \\left( \\sum_{n=0}^{m-1} 2^{-n/2} d_n(k) \\right)^2 = \\sum_{k=0}^{2^m-1} \\sum_{n=0}^{m-1} \\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} 2^{-(n+j)/2} d_n(k) d_j(k) $$\nBy swapping the order of summation:\n$$ V_2(f, \\mathcal{P}_m) = \\sum_{n=0}^{m-1} \\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} 2^{-(n+j)/2} \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{2^m-1} d_n(k) d_j(k) \\right) $$\nWe will show that the cross-terms, where $n \\ne j$, sum to zero. Let's analyze the inner sum $\\sum_k d_n(k) d_j(k)$. Assume $nj$.\nFirst, we establish a key property of $\\phi(u)$. For any $u \\in \\mathbb{R}$, $\\phi(u) + \\phi(u+1/2) = 1/2$. To see this, if $u \\in [0, 1/2]$, then $\\phi(u)=u$ and $u+1/2 \\in [1/2, 1]$, so $\\phi(u+1/2) = 1-(u+1/2) = 1/2-u$. Their sum is $1/2$. Since $\\phi(u)$ is $1$-periodic and $\\phi(u+1/2)+\\phi(u)$ is $1/2$-periodic, this identity holds for all $u$.\nThis implies $\\phi(v+1/2) - \\phi(u+1/2) = -(\\phi(v)-\\phi(u))$ for any $u,v$.\n\nNow, let $S = 2^{m-n-1}$. Let's examine $d_n(k+S)$:\n$$ d_n(k+S) = \\phi(2^{n-m}(k+S+1)) - \\phi(2^{n-m}(k+S)) = \\phi(2^n t_{k+1} + 1/2) - \\phi(2^n t_k + 1/2) $$\nUsing the identity from above with $v=2^n t_{k+1}$ and $u=2^n t_k$, we get $d_n(k+S) = -d_n(k)$. So the sequence $\\{d_n(k)\\}_k$ is anti-periodic with period $S=2^{m-n-1}$.\n\nFor $jn$, the sequence $\\{d_j(k)\\}_k$ is periodic with period $P_j = 2^{m-j}$. The shift $S$ is an integer multiple of $P_j$, since $S/P_j = 2^{m-n-1}/2^{m-j} = 2^{j-n-1}$, and $jn$ implies $j-n-1 \\ge 0$. Thus, $d_j(k+S)=d_j(k)$.\n\nThe total sum $\\sum_{k=0}^{2^m-1} d_n(k)d_j(k)$ can be seen to be zero by pairing terms that are $S$ apart. More formally, we can group the sum:\n$$ \\sum_{k=0}^{2^m-1} d_n(k)d_j(k) = \\sum_{i=0}^{2^{n+1}-1} \\sum_{l=0}^{S-1} d_n(l+iS)d_j(l+iS) = \\sum_{i=0}^{2^{n+1}-1} \\sum_{l=0}^{S-1} (-1)^i d_n(l) d_j(l) $$\n$$ = \\left( \\sum_{i=0}^{2^{n+1}-1} (-1)^i \\right) \\left( \\sum_{l=0}^{S-1} d_n(l)d_j(l) \\right) = 0 $$\nThe sum $\\sum_{i=0}^{2^{n+1}-1}(-1)^i$ is $0$ because $n \\ge 0$, so $2^{n+1}$ is an even number.\nThus, all cross-terms where $n \\ne j$ are zero. The quadratic variation simplifies to:\n$$ V_2(f, \\mathcal{P}_m) = \\sum_{n=0}^{m-1} 2^{-n} \\sum_{k=0}^{2^m-1} d_n(k)^2 $$\nNow we compute the inner sum $S_n = \\sum_{k=0}^{2^m-1} d_n(k)^2$. The terms $d_n(k)^2$ are for increments of $\\phi$ on a grid of spacing $2^{n-m}$ over the argument range $[0, 2^n]$. Due to the $1$-periodicity of $\\phi$, the sum is $2^n$ times the sum over the argument range $[0,1]$.\nThe sum over $[0,1]$ corresponds to a partition of $[0,1]$ into $2^{m-n}$ subintervals. Let $M=m-n$.\n$$ \\sum_{i=0}^{2^M-1} (\\phi((i+1)2^{-M}) - \\phi(i 2^{-M}))^2 $$\nOn $[0,1]$, $\\phi(u)=u$ for $u \\in [0,1/2]$ and $\\phi(u)=1-u$ for $u \\in [1/2,1]$. The breakpoint is at $u=1/2$, which corresponds to $i=2^{M-1}$.\nFor $i \\in \\{0, \\dots, 2^{M-1}-1\\}$, the interval is in $[0,1/2]$. The difference is $(i+1)2^{-M}-i2^{-M}=2^{-M}$. The sum of squares is $2^{M-1} \\cdot (2^{-M})^2 = 2^{-M-1}$.\nFor $i \\in \\{2^{M-1}, \\dots, 2^M-1\\}$, the interval is in $[1/2,1]$. The difference is $(1-(i+1)2^{-M})-(1-i2^{-M})=-2^{-M}$. The sum of squares is $2^{M-1} \\cdot (-2^{-M})^2 = 2^{-M-1}$.\nThe total sum for the range $[0,1]$ is $2^{-M-1}+2^{-M-1}=2^{-M} = 2^{-(m-n)}$.\nThus, $S_n = 2^n \\cdot 2^{-(m-n)} = 2^{2n-m}$.\n\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $V_2(f, \\mathcal{P}_m)$:\n$$ V_2(f, \\mathcal{P}_m) = \\sum_{n=0}^{m-1} 2^{-n} (2^{2n-m}) = \\sum_{n=0}^{m-1} 2^{n-m} = 2^{-m} \\sum_{n=0}^{m-1} 2^n $$\nThis is a finite geometric series:\n$$ V_2(f, \\mathcal{P}_m) = 2^{-m} \\frac{2^m-1}{2-1} = 2^{-m}(2^m-1) = 1 - 2^{-m} $$\nFinally, we take the limit as $m \\to \\infty$:\n$$ \\lim_{m\\to\\infty} V_2(f, \\mathcal{P}_m) = \\lim_{m\\to\\infty} (1 - 2^{-m}) = 1 $$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "3006473"}]}
