For options A, B, and D, the proposed Lyapunov function is $V(x) = \\frac{1}{2}(R(x)-r^\\ast)^2$. Let us first compute the necessary derivatives of $V(x)$:\n- The gradient of $V(x)$ is $\\nabla V(x) = (R(x)-r^\\ast)\\nabla R(x)$. Since $\\nabla R(x) = \\frac{x}{R(x)} = e_r(x)$, we have:\n$$\n\\nabla V(x) = (R(x)-r^\\ast)e_r(x)\n$$\n- The Hessian matrix of $V(x)$ is $\\nabla^2 V(x)$. A calculation shows:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 V(x) = e_r(x)e_r(x)^\\top + \\frac{R(x)-r^\\ast}{R(x)}\\big(I - e_r(x)e_r(x)^\\top\\big)\n$$\nNote that $e_r e_r^\\top$ is the projection matrix onto the radial direction, and $I - e_r e_r^\\top$ is the projection matrix onto the tangential direction. In $\\mathbb{R}^2$, the tangential direction is spanned by $Je_r$, so $I - e_r e_r^\\top = (Je_r)(Je_r)^\\top$.\n\n####  Option A\nThe drift and diffusion fields are:\n$$\nb(x) = -k\\big(R(x)-r^\\ast\\big)\\,e_r(x) - \\tfrac{1}{2}\\frac{s^\\ast}{R(x)}\\,e_r(x) + \\omega\\,Jx,\\qquad \\sigma(x) = \\sqrt{s^\\ast}\\,J e_r(x)\n$$\n1.  **Compute the drift part of $\\mathcal{L}V$:** $\\nabla V(x)\\cdot b(x)$.\n    $$\n    \\nabla V(x)\\cdot b(x) = (R-r^\\ast)e_r \\cdot \\left( -k(R-r^\\ast)e_r - \\tfrac{1}{2}\\frac{s^\\ast}{R}e_r + \\omega Jx \\right)\n    $$\n    Using $e_r \\cdot e_r = 1$ and $e_r \\cdot Jx = R(e_r \\cdot J e_r) = 0$ (since $e_r$ and $Je_r$ are orthogonal), we get:\n    $$\n    \\nabla V(x)\\cdot b(x) = (R-r^\\ast) \\left( -k(R-r^\\ast) - \\tfrac{1}{2}\\frac{s^\\ast}{R} \\right) = -k(R-r^\\ast)^2 - \\frac{s^\\ast(R-r^\\ast)}{2R}\n    $$\n2.  **Compute the diffusion part of $\\mathcal{L}V$:** $\\tfrac{1}{2}\\,\\mathrm{tr}\\!\\big(\\sigma(x)\\sigma(x)^\\top \\nabla^2 V(x)\\big)$.\n    The diffusion matrix is $\\sigma\\sigma^\\top = (\\sqrt{s^\\ast}Je_r)(\\sqrt{s^\\ast}Je_r)^\\top = s^\\ast (Je_r)(Je_r)^\\top$.\n    We compute the product $\\sigma\\sigma^\\top \\nabla^2 V$:\n    $$\n    \\sigma\\sigma^\\top \\nabla^2 V = s^\\ast(Je_r)(Je_r)^\\top \\left( e_r e_r^\\top + \\frac{R-r^\\ast}{R}(Je_r)(Je_r)^\\top \\right)\n    $$\n    Since $(Je_r)^\\top e_r = 0$, the first term in the bracket vanishes. Using $(Je_r)^\\top (Je_r) = 1$:\n    $$\n    \\sigma\\sigma^\\top \\nabla^2 V = s^\\ast \\frac{R-r^\\ast}{R} (Je_r)\\underbrace{((Je_r)^\\top Je_r)}_{=1}(Je_r)^\\top = s^\\ast \\frac{R-r^\\ast}{R} (Je_r)(Je_r)^\\top\n    $$\n    The trace is $\\mathrm{tr}(A) = s^\\ast \\frac{R-r^\\ast}{R} \\mathrm{tr}((Je_r)(Je_r)^\\top)$. Using $\\mathrm{tr}(uv^\\top)=v^\\top u$, we have $\\mathrm{tr}((Je_r)(Je_r)^\\top) = (Je_r)^\\top(Je_r) = 1$.\n    $$\n    \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,\\mathrm{tr}(\\sigma\\sigma^\\top \\nabla^2 V) = \\tfrac{1}{2} s^\\ast \\frac{R-r^\\ast}{R}\n    $$\n3.  **Combine the parts to find $\\mathcal{L}V(x)$:**\n    $$\n    \\mathcal{L}V(x) = \\left( -k(R-r^\\ast)^2 - \\frac{s^\\ast(R-r^\\ast)}{2R} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{s^\\ast(R-r^\\ast)}{2R} \\right) = -k(R-r^\\ast)^2\n    $$\n4.  **Analyze the result:**\n    Since $k  0$, $\\mathcal{L}V(x) = -k(R(x)-r^\\ast)^2 \\le 0$ for all $x \\neq 0$. Equality holds if and only if $R(x)=r^\\ast$. The set $E = \\{x : \\mathcal{L}V(x)=0\\}$ is the circle $\\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : \\|x\\|=r^\\ast\\}$.\n    On this circle, the Itô SDE for the radius $R_t$ becomes $\\mathrm{d}R_t = 0\\,\\mathrm{d}t + 0\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t$, meaning the circle is an invariant manifold. The term $-\\frac{s^\\ast}{2R(x)}e_r(x)$ is the Itô correction that ensures this invariance under tangential noise. The angular component of the SDE on the circle is $\\mathrm{d}\\theta_t = \\omega\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\frac{\\sqrt{s^\\ast}}{r^\\ast}\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t$, which describes a drifted Brownian motion on the circle. This motion is recurrent.\n    Trajectories starting near the origin do not converge to the origin; instead, their radial component $R_t$ converges to $r^\\ast$. The full trajectory converges to the stochastic limit cycle on the circle $\\|x\\|=r^\\ast$. Therefore, the origin is not a.s. asymptotically stable. The description in option A is entirely correct.\n    \n    Verdict for A: **Correct**.\n\n#### Option B\nThe diffusion field is now radial: $\\sigma(x) = \\sqrt{s^\\ast}\\,e_r(x)$. The drift $b(x)$ is the same as in A.\n1.  **Drift part of $\\mathcal{L}V$:** The calculation is identical to A, yielding $\\nabla V(x) \\cdot b(x) = -k(R-r^\\ast)^2 - \\frac{s^\\ast(R-r^\\ast)}{2R}$.\n2.  **Diffusion part of $\\mathcal{L}V$:**\n    The diffusion matrix is $\\sigma\\sigma^\\top = s^\\ast e_r e_r^\\top$.\n    $$\n    \\sigma\\sigma^\\top \\nabla^2 V = s^\\ast(e_r)(e_r)^\\top \\left( e_r e_r^\\top + \\frac{R-r^\\ast}{R}(Je_r)(Je_r)^\\top \\right)\n    $$\n    Since $(e_r)^\\top (Je_r) = 0$, the second term vanishes. Using $(e_r)^\\top e_r = 1$:\n    $$\n    \\sigma\\sigma^\\top \\nabla^2 V = s^\\ast (e_r)\\underbrace{((e_r)^\\top e_r)}_{=1}(e_r)^\\top = s^\\ast e_r e_r^\\top\n    $$\n    The trace is $\\mathrm{tr}(s^\\ast e_r e_r^\\top) = s^\\ast \\mathrm{tr}(e_r e_r^\\top) = s^\\ast$.\n    $$\n    \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,\\mathrm{tr}(\\sigma\\sigma^\\top \\nabla^2 V) = \\tfrac{1}{2} s^\\ast\n    $$\n3.  **Combine to find $\\mathcal{L}V(x)$:**\n    $$\n    \\mathcal{L}V(x) = -k(R-r^\\ast)^2 - \\frac{s^\\ast(R-r^\\ast)}{2R} + \\frac{s^\\ast}{2}\n    $$\n4.  **Analyze the result:**\n    The option claims $\\mathcal{L}V(x) \\le 0$. On the circle $\\{x: \\|x\\|=r^\\ast\\}$, we have $R=r^\\ast$, so $\\mathcal{L}V(x) = -k(0)^2 - \\frac{s^\\ast(0)}{2r^\\ast} + \\frac{s^\\ast}{2} = \\frac{s^\\ast}{2}$. Since $s^\\ast  0$, $\\mathcal{L}V(x)0$ on the circle. The Lyapunov condition $\\mathcal{L}V \\le 0$ is violated.\n\n    Verdict for B: **Incorrect**.\n\n#### Option C\nThis is a deterministic system ($\\sigma(x) \\equiv 0$) with $b(x) = \\omega Jx$. The Lyapunov function is $V(x) = \\frac{1}{2}\\|x\\|^2$.\n1.  **Compute $\\mathcal{L}V$**: Since $\\sigma=0$, the generator is just the Lie derivative $\\mathcal{L}V(x) = \\nabla V(x) \\cdot b(x)$.\n    $\\nabla V(x) = x$.\n    $$\n    \\mathcal{L}V(x) = x \\cdot (\\omega Jx) = \\omega x^\\top Jx = \\omega(x_1(-x_2) + x_2(x_1)) = 0\n    $$\n    So $\\mathcal{L}V(x) = 0$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$.\n2.  **Analyze the result**:\n    The solutions to $\\dot{x} = \\omega Jx$ are circles, so $\\|x(t)\\|$ is constant for any trajectory. The origin is stable (Lyapunov stable) but not asymptotically stable, as trajectories do not converge to the origin (unless they start there).\n    The option correctly states that the invariant set is larger than $\\{0\\}$ and supports recurrent motion. However, it concludes: \"Therefore, the origin is a.s. asymptotically stable.\" This conclusion is false.\n\n    Verdict for C: **Incorrect**.\n\n#### Option D\nThis option omits the Itô correction term from the drift in option A.\n$$\nb(x) = -k\\big(R(x)-r^\\ast\\big)\\,e_r(x)+\\omega\\,Jx,\\qquad \\sigma(x) = \\sqrt{s^\\ast}\\,J e_r(x)\n$$\n1.  **Drift part of $\\mathcal{L}V$:**\n    $$\n    \\nabla V(x)\\cdot b(x) = (R-r^\\ast)e_r \\cdot \\left( -k(R-r^\\ast)e_r + \\omega Jx \\right) = -k(R-r^\\ast)^2\n    $$\n2.  **Diffusion part of $\\mathcal{L}V$:** This is identical to option A.\n    $$\n    \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,\\mathrm{tr}(\\sigma\\sigma^\\top \\nabla^2 V) = \\tfrac{1}{2} s^\\ast \\frac{R-r^\\ast}{R}\n    $$\n3.  **Combine to find $\\mathcal{L}V(x)$:**\n    $$\n    \\mathcal{L}V(x) = -k(R-r^\\ast)^2 + \\frac{s^\\ast(R-r^\\ast)}{2R}\n    $$\n4.  **Analyze the result:**\n    The option claims $\\mathcal{L}V(x) \\le 0$. Let's test this.\n    For $R  r^\\ast$, $R-r^\\ast  0$. We can factor it out:\n    $$\n    \\mathcal{L}V(x) = (R-r^\\ast)\\left(-k(R-r^\\ast) + \\frac{s^\\ast}{2R}\\right)\n    $$\n    For $R$ slightly larger than $r^\\ast$, say $R = r^\\ast + \\epsilon$ with small $\\epsilon  0$, the second factor is approximately $-k\\epsilon + \\frac{s^\\ast}{2r^\\ast}$. For sufficiently small $\\epsilon$, this term is positive (since $s^\\ast 0, r^\\ast  0$). Thus, $\\mathcal{L}V(x)  0$ for $x$ in a region just outside the circle $\\|x\\|=r^\\ast$. The condition $\\mathcal{L}V \\le 0$ is not satisfied, so $V$ is not a valid Lyapunov function for this system to prove stability.\n\n    Verdict for D: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2969146"}]}
