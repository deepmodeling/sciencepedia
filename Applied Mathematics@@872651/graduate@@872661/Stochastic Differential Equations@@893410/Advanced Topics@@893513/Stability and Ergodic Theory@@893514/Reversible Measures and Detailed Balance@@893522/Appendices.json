Do not round the answer.", "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. It presents a standard, solvable problem in the theory of stochastic processes.\n\nThe Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process is described by the stochastic differential equation (SDE):\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}X_{t} \\,=\\, -B X_{t} \\,\\mathrm{d}t \\,+\\, \\sqrt{2} \\sigma \\,\\mathrm{d}W_{t}\n$$\nThis is a linear SDE of the form $\\mathrm{d}X_t = b(X_t) \\mathrm{d}t + \\Sigma(X_t) \\mathrm{d}W_t$, where the drift vector is $b(x) = -Bx$ and the diffusion matrix is $\\Sigma(x) = \\sqrt{2}\\sigma$. The problem specifies that $\\sigma$ is a constant matrix.\n\nThe corresponding stationary Fokker-Planck equation describes the time evolution of the probability density function $p(x)$ of the process. In the stationary state, $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = 0$, and the equation reduces to the statement that the divergence of the probability current $J(x)$ is zero: $\\nabla \\cdot J(x) = 0$. The probability current is given by:\n$$\nJ(x) = b(x)p(x) - \\nabla \\cdot (D p(x))\n$$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion tensor, defined as $D = \\frac{1}{2} \\Sigma \\Sigma^{\\top}$. For this process, we have:\n$$\nD = \\frac{1}{2} (\\sqrt{2}\\sigma)(\\sqrt{2}\\sigma)^{\\top} = \\frac{1}{2} (2 \\sigma\\sigma^{\\top}) = \\sigma\\sigma^{\\top} = Q\n$$\nSince $Q$ is a constant matrix, the gradient term simplifies to $\\nabla \\cdot (Q p(x)) = Q \\nabla p(x)$. The probability current is therefore:\n$$\nJ(x) = -B x p(x) - Q \\nabla p(x)\n$$\n\nThe condition for reversibility, or detailed balance, is a stronger condition than stationarity. It requires the stationary probability current to be identically zero for all $x$: $J(x)=0$. Applying this to our expression for the current gives:\n$$\n-B x p(x) - Q \\nabla p(x) = 0\n$$\n\nThe problem states that the process admits a unique invariant Gaussian measure. The probability density function $p(x)$ of this measure is of the form:\n$$\np(x) = C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2} x^{\\top} S^{-1} x\\right)\n$$\nwhere $S$ is the symmetric positive definite covariance matrix of the stationary distribution and $C$ is a normalization constant. To use the detailed balance condition, we need the gradient of $p(x)$:\n$$\n\\nabla p(x) = p(x) \\nabla \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} x^{\\top} S^{-1} x\\right)\n$$\nUsing the identity for the gradient of a quadratic form, $\\nabla(x^{\\top} A x) = (A+A^{\\top})x$, and the fact that $S^{-1}$ is symmetric, we find:\n$$\n\\nabla(x^{\\top} S^{-1} x) = 2 S^{-1} x\n$$\nThus, the gradient of the log-probability is $\\nabla \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} x^{\\top} S^{-1} x\\right) = -S^{-1}x$.

Right-multiplying by $S$ gives the condition for reversibility in terms of $B$, $Q$, and $S$:\n$$\nBS = Q\n$$\n\nThis condition must be reconciled with the general equation for the stationary covariance matrix $S$. For any OU process of the given form, the stationary covariance matrix $S$ is the unique, symmetric, positive definite solution to the continuous-time Lyapunov equation:\n$$\nBS + SB^{\\top} = 2Q\n$$\nThis equation holds regardless of whether the process is reversible.\n\nFor the process to be reversible, its covariance matrix $S$ must satisfy both the reversibility condition $BS = Q$ and the Lyapunov equation. Substituting $BS=Q$ into the Lyapunov equation gives:\n$$\nQ + SB^{\\top} = 2Q \\quad \\implies \\quad SB^{\\top} = Q\n$$\nTherefore, in the reversible case, the Lyapunov equation effectively splits into two simpler conditions:\n$$\nBS = Q \\quad \\text{and} \\quad SB^{\\top} = Q\n$$\nEquating these two expressions for $Q$ yields $BS = SB^{\\top}$. This is a symmetry condition on the matrix $B$ with respect to the inner product defined by $S$. To obtain a condition purely on the given matrices $B$ and $Q$, we can use $S = B^{-1}Q$ (from $BS=Q$). Substituting this into the second equation, $SB^{\\top}=Q$, gives:\n$$\n(B^{-1}Q)B^{\\top} = Q\n$$\nLeft-multiplying by $B$ gives the necessary condition for reversibility:\n$$\nQB^{\\top} = BQ\n$$\nThis condition states that $B$ and $Q$ must commute in a specific way. It can be interpreted as $B$ being self-adjoint with respect to the inner product induced by $Q^{-1}$.\n\nTo show this condition is also sufficient, we assume $BQ = QB^{\\top}$ and demonstrate that the process is reversible. The stationary covariance $S$ is the unique symmetric positive definite solution to the Lyapunov equation $BS + SB^{\\top} = 2Q$. We must show that if $BQ = QB^{\\top}$, this solution $S$ also satisfies the reversibility condition $BS=Q$.\nLet's propose the candidate solution $S_{p} = B^{-1}Q$.\nFirst, we check if $S_{p}$ is symmetric under the assumption $BQ = QB^{\\top}$:\n$$\nS_{p}^{\\top} = (B^{-1}Q)^{\\top} = Q^{\\top}(B^{-1})^{\\top} = Q(B^{\\top})^{-1}\n$$\nFor $S_{p}$ to be symmetric, we need $B^{-1}Q = Q(B^{\\top})^{-1}$. Left-multiplying by $B$ and right-multiplying by $B^{\\top}$ shows that this is equivalent to $QB^{\\top} = BQ$, our assumed condition. Thus, $S_p$ is symmetric.\nSecond, we check if $S_{p}$ solves the Lyapunov equation under our assumption:\n$$\nBS_{p} + S_{p}B^{\\top} = B(B^{-1}Q) + (B^{-1}Q)B^{\\top} = Q + B^{-1}(QB^{\\top})\n$$\nUsing the assumption $QB^{\\top}=BQ$, the expression becomes:\n$$\nQ + B^{-1}(BQ) = Q + (B^{-1}B)Q = Q + IQ = 2Q\n$$\nSo, $S_{p} = B^{-1}Q$ is indeed the unique symmetric solution to the Lyapunov equation. Therefore, the actual covariance matrix is $S = B^{-1}Q$.\nFinally, for this $S$, we check the reversibility condition $BS=Q$:\n$$\nBS = B(B^{-1}Q) = Q\n$$\nThe condition is satisfied. Thus, the condition $BQ = QB^{\\top}$ is both necessary and sufficient for the OU process to be reversible.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for the closed-form expression for the invariant covariance $S$ under these conditions. As shown in the sufficiency proof above, when the reversibility condition $BQ = QB^{\\top}$ holds, the stationary covariance matrix $S$ that solves the Lyapunov equation is given by:\n$$\nS = B^{-1}Q\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{B^{-1}Q}\n$$", "id": "2994321"}, {"introduction": "A process can be stationary without being reversible, a crucial distinction that this exercise illuminates.

Stationarity and Non-Reversibility**\n\nThe existence of a unique solution $\\Sigma=I$ to the Lyapunov equation confirms that the process is stationary with the determined Gaussian density $\\pi(x)$.\n\nA diffusion process is reversible (satisfies detailed balance) with respect to its stationary measure $\\pi$ if and only if its generator $\\mathcal{L}$ is self-adjoint in the Hilbert space $L^2(\\pi)$.

In our case, with $\\Sigma=I$, the condition for reversibility becomes $B = B^{\\top}$.\nLet's check this condition:\n$$\nB = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  -\\omega \\\\ \\omega  1 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad B^{\\top} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  \\omega \\\\ -\\omega  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor $B = B^{\\top}$, we must have $-\\omega = \\omega$, which implies $2\\omega=0$, so $\\omega=0$.

The generator is then $\\mathcal{L}f = (D \\nabla \\ln \\pi + j(x)) \\cdot \\nabla f + \\Delta f$. The components are:\n- Symmetric part: $\\mathcal{L}_S f = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\nabla \\cdot (\\pi D \\nabla f) = (D \\nabla \\ln \\pi) \\cdot \\nabla f + \\Delta f$ (since $D=I$, we have $\\nabla \\cdot (D\\nabla f) = \\Delta f$)\n- Antisymmetric part: $\\mathcal{L}_A f = j(x) \\cdot \\nabla f$\n\nFor our process, we have $b(x) = -Bx$ and $\\nabla \\ln \\pi(x) = -x$. The irreversible drift $j(x)$ is:\n$$\nj(x) = b(x) - D \\nabla \\ln \\pi(x) = -Bx - I(-x) = -Bx + x = (I-B)x\n$$\nThe antisymmetric part of the generator arising from the drift is therefore $\\mathcal{L}_A f(x) = ((I-B)x) \\cdot \\nabla f(x)$. The \"coefficient matrix\" of this antisymmetric component is the matrix $A$ such that $j(x) = Ax$.\n$$\nA = I - B = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 1  -\\omega \\\\ \\omega  1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  \\omega \\\\ -\\omega  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis is a skew-symmetric matrix, as expected for an irreversible drift. To quantify this part, we compute its Frobenius norm $\\|A\\|_F$.\n$$\n\\|A\\|_F = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{2}\\sum_{j=1}^{2} |A_{ij}|^2} = \\sqrt{0^2 + \\omega^2 + (-\\omega)^2 + 0^2} = \\sqrt{2\\omega^2}\n$$\nSince $\\omega$ is a real number, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\|A\\|_F = \\sqrt{2}|\\omega|\n$$\nThis value gives a measure of the strength of the non-reversible part of the dynamics.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{2}|\\omega|}$$", "id": "2994291"}]}
