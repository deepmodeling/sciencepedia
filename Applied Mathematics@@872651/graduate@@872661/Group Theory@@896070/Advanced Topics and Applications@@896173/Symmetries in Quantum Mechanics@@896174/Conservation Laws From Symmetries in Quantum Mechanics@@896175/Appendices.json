Its quantum states are described by the eigenstates $|n, m_l\\rangle$ of the Hamiltonian $H_0$ and the angular momentum operator $L_z = -i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\phi}$. The eigenvalue of $L_z$ for a state $|n, m_l\\rangle$ is $m_l\\hbar$, where $m_l$ is an integer.\n\nA weak, rotationally invariant interaction $H_{int}$ causes this particle to decay into a pair of identical, spinless bosons. The state of this two-boson system, in its center-of-mass frame, is described by a wavefunction of the relative coordinate $\\vec{r}$. As the bosons are identical, this wavefunction must obey Bose-Einstein statistics.

Since the interaction is rotationally invariant, the total angular momentum is conserved. The problem states this simplifies to requiring the final relative orbital angular momentum quantum number, $l$, to equal the initial magnetic quantum number, $m_l$.\n2. Bose symmetry under exchange of the two identical bosons ($\\vec{r} \\to -\\vec{r}$) requires the final wavefunction $\\psi_l$ to be symmetric, i.e., $\\psi_l(-\\vec{r}) = \\psi_l(\\vec{r})$.
