We denote vectors in this space as $\\psi^i$ where $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. The dual (or contragredient) representation acts on the dual space $V^*$, with vectors denoted as $\\phi_j$.\n\nConsider the tensor product space $W = V \\otimes V^*$. The elements of this space are rank-2 tensors with components $T^i_j$. Under an $SU(4)$ group transformation represented by a matrix $U$, these tensors transform as $T \\to T' = UTU^{-1}$, or in component form, $(T')^i_j = U^i_k T^k_l (U^{-1})^l_j$.\n\nThis representation on the space $W$ is reducible. It can be decomposed into a direct sum of irreducible representations. This is accomplished by separating any tensor $T \\in W$ into its traceless part and its trace part. The trace of a tensor, $\\text{Tr}(T) = \\sum_{k=1}^4 T^k_k$, transforms as a scalar under $SU(4)$ transformations and spans a one-dimensional invariant subspace, corresponding to the trivial (singlet) representation.
