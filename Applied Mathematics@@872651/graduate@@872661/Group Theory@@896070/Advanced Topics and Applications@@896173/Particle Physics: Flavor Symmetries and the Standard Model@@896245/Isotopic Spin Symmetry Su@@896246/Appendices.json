Under this symmetry, particles are grouped into isospin multiplets. For example, the proton ($p$) and the neutron ($n$) form an isospin doublet (isospin quantum number $I=1/2$), while the three pions ($\\pi^+, \\pi^0, \\pi^-$) form an isospin triplet ($I=1$). The specific member of a multiplet is distinguished by the third component of isospin, $I_3$.\n\nThe standard assignments for the particles relevant to this problem are:\n-   Proton ($p$): $|I=1/2, I_3=+1/2\\rangle$\n-   Negative Pion ($\\pi^-$): $|I=1, I_3=-1\\rangle$\n\nWhen combining particles, their isospins add according to the rules of angular momentum addition. For a system of two particles with isospins $I_A$ and $I_B$, the total isospin $I_{tot}$ can take values in the range $|I_A - I_B| \\le I_{tot} \\le I_A + I_B$ in integer steps.\n\n**Problem:**\nConsider a quantum system consisting of two protons and one negative pion. The state of this composite system is described by the tensor product state vector:\n$$|\\Psi\\rangle = |p\\rangle \\otimes |p\\rangle \\otimes |\\pi^-\\rangle$$\nA measurement of the total isospin squared operator, $\\hat{I}_{tot}^2$, is performed on the system. The result of such a measurement is an eigenvalue of the form $I_{tot}(I_{tot}+1)$ (in units of $\\hbar^2=1$).\n\nCalculate the probability of measuring the total isospin quantum number to be $I_{tot}=2$.", "solution": "1. The two protons are identical fermions, so their combined state must be antisymmetric under exchange. However, since the problem only specifies the isospin part, we treat them as distinguishable for this calculation. Each proton has $I=1/2$, $I_3=+1/2$. Their joint isospin can be $I_{pp}=0$ or $1$. The total $I_{3,pp} = 1/2+1/2=1$. Since a state with $I_{pp}=0$ must have $I_{3,pp}=0$, the two-proton system must be in a state with $I_{pp}=1$. Thus, the two-proton state is $|pp\\rangle=|1,1\\rangle_{pp}$.\n\n2. We now combine the two-proton state ($I_{pp}=1, I_{3,pp}=1$) with the negative pion state ($I_{\\pi}=1, I_{3,\\pi}=-1$). The total $I_3$ of the system is $I_{3,\\text{tot}} = I_{3,pp} + I_{3,\\pi} = 1 + (-1) = 0$. The possible values for the total isospin $I_{\\text{tot}}$ are $|1-1| \\dots 1+1$, which are $I_{\\text{tot}} \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$.\n\n3.

According to the projection postulate of quantum mechanics, the probability of measuring a specific eigenvalue is the squared magnitude of the amplitude (coefficient) of the corresponding eigenstate in the superposition.
