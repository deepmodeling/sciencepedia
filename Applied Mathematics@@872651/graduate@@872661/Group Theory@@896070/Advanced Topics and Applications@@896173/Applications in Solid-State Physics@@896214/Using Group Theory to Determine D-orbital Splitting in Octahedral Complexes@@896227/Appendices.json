The symmetry of this splitting can be elegantly determined using group theory.\n\nConsider a metal ion at the center of an octahedral complex. The Cartesian axes $(x, y, z)$ are aligned with the metal-ligand bonds, which correspond to the $C_4$ axes of the octahedron. The five real d-orbitals can be represented by functions proportional to certain combinations of Cartesian coordinates.
