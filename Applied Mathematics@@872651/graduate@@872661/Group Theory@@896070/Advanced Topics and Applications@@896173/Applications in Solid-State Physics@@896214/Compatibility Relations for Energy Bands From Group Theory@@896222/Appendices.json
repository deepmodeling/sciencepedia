These connections are governed by compatibility relations, which are derived by decomposing the irreducible representations (irreps) of the group of the wave vector at a high-symmetry point into those of a lower-symmetry point or line.\n\nConsider a crystal with a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice. The point group of this lattice is $O_h$. At the center of the Brillouin zone, the $\\Gamma$ point ($\\mathbf{k}=0$), the group of the wave vector is the full point group $O_h$.

The 2-dimensional level $X_1$ at X connects to two of these bands ($Y_2$ and $Y_3$).\nThe other 2D level at X, $X_2$, would connect to the remaining two bands. Let's check for consistency:\n$\\chi_{X_2 \\downarrow Y} = (2,0,0,2)$.\n$a_1^{(X_2 \\downarrow Y)} = \\frac{1}{4} [1\\cdot 2 + 1\\cdot 2] = 1$.\n$a_2^{(X_2 \\downarrow Y)} = \\frac{1}{4} [1\\cdot 2 + (-1)2] = 0$.\n$a_3^{(X_2 \\downarrow Y)} = \\frac{1}{4} [1\\cdot 2 + (-1)2] = 0$.\n$a_4^{(X_2 \\downarrow Y)} = \\frac{1}{4} [1\\cdot 2 + 1\\cdot 2] = 1$.\nSo $X_2 \\downarrow Y = Y_1 + Y_4$, and $C_{X_2} = 1+1=2$. The total character decomposition is consistent with the bands from M being fully accounted for by the bands from X.\nThe problem requires the calculation of $\\mathcal{C}_{X_1, \\Gamma_M}$, which is the product of the sums of multiplicities.\n\nFinal calculation:\n$C_{X_1} = a_1^{(X_1)} + a_2^{(X_1)} + a_3^{(X_1)} + a_4^{(X_1)} = 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 2$.\n$C_{\\Gamma_M} = a_1^{(\\Gamma_M)} + a_2^{(\\Gamma_M)} + a_3^{(\\Gamma_M)} + a_4^{(\\Gamma_M)} = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4$.\n$\\mathcal{C}_{X_1, \\Gamma_M} = C_{X_1} \\times C_{\\Gamma_M} = 2 \\times 4 = 8$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{8} $$", "id": "645322"}]}
