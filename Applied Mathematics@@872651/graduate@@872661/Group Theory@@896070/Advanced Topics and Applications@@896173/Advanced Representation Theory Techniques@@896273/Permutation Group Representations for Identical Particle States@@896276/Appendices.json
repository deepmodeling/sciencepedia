This first practice [@problem_id:739788] provides a clear, hands-on example of this principle, showing how specifying the spatial wavefunction's symmetry (via the orbital angular momentum $L$) directly imposes a selection rule on the allowed total spin $S$ for a system of two identical bosons.", "problem": "Consider a system composed of two identical deuterons. A deuteron is a composite particle with a nuclear spin quantum number $I=1$ and is a boson. The total wavefunction of the system, $\\Psi_{\\text{total}}$, can be expressed as a product of a spatial part and a spin part: $\\Psi_{\\text{total}} = \\psi_{\\text{spatial}} \\otimes \\chi_{\\text{spin}}$.\n\nFor a system of identical bosons, the total wavefunction must be symmetric under the exchange of any two particles. The symmetry of the spatial part of the wavefunction, $\\psi_{\\text{spatial}}$, under particle exchange is determined by the relative orbital angular momentum quantum number, $L$.

Substituting these into the symmetry equation, we get:\n    $$+1 = (-1)^L \\times (-1)^{2I-S}$$\n\n4.  **Substituting System-Specific Parameters**:\n    The system consists of two deuterons, which have spin $I=1$.

If $S$ is an integer, this is equivalent to requiring $S$ to be an odd integer.\n\n6.  **Finding Possible Values of Total Spin S**:\n    The total spin quantum number $S$ is obtained by coupling two individual spins with $I=1$.

Not allowed.\n    -   For $S=1$: $S$ is odd. Allowed.\n    -   For $S=2$: $S$ is even. Not allowed.\n    Therefore, the only allowed value for the total spin quantum number is $S=1$.
