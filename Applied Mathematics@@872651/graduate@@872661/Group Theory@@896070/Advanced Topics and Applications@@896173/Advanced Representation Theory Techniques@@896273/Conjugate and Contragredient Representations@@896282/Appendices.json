This quantity is denoted by $n_{-1}$. We are given an identity and are tasked to first derive a general formula for $n_y$ for an arbitrary element $y$ in a finite group $G$.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the formula for $n_y$**\n\nWe start with the given identity:\n$$\n\\sum_{x \\in G} n_x \\chi(x) = |G| \\nu(\\chi)\n$$\nThis identity holds for any irreducible character $\\chi$ of $G$. To isolate $n_y$ for a specific element $y \\in G$, we can use the orthogonality relations of characters. We multiply the equation by $\\overline{\\chi(y)}$ (the complex conjugate of $\\chi(y)$) and sum over all irreducible characters $\\chi \\in \\text{Irr}(G)$:\n$$\n\\sum_{\\chi \\in \\text{Irr}(G)} \\left( \\sum_{x \\in G} n_x \\chi(x) \\right) \\overline{\\chi(y)} = \\sum_{\\chi \\in \\text{Irr}(G)} |G| \\nu(\\chi) \\overline{\\chi(y)}\n$$\nLet's focus on the left-hand side (LHS). We can swap the order of summation:\n$$\n\\text{LHS} = \\sum_{x \\in G} n_x \\left( \\sum_{\\chi \\in \\text{Irr}(G)} \\chi(x) \\overline{\\chi(y)} \\right)\n$$\nNow, we apply the second orthogonality relation for characters, which states:\n$$\n\\sum_{\\chi \\in \\text{Irr}(G)} \\chi(x) \\overline{\\chi(y)} = \n\\begin{cases}\n    |C_G(x)| & \\text{if } x \\text{ is conjugate to } y \\\\\n    0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwhere $C_G(x)$ is the centralizer of $x$ in $G$. Let $K_y$ denote the conjugacy class of $y$. The sum over $x$ is non-zero only for $x \\in K_y$.\nThe number of square roots, $n_x$, is a class function, meaning it is constant on conjugacy classes. If $x$ and $y$ are conjugate, say $x = gyg^{-1}$, then $h^2 = x$ if and only if $(g^{-1}hg)^2 = y$. The map $h \\mapsto g^{-1}hg$ is a bijection, so $n_x=n_y$.\nTherefore, for any $x \\in K_y$, $n_x=n_y$. Also, for $x \\in K_y$, the centralizer size $|C_G(x)|$ is constant and equal to $|C_G(y)|$.\nThe LHS then becomes:\n$$\n\\text{LHS} = \\sum_{x \\in K_y} n_x |C_G(x)| = \\sum_{x \\in K_y} n_y |C_G(y)| = |K_y| n_y |C_G(y)|\n$$\nUsing the orbit-stabilizer theorem, we know that $|K_y| |C_G(y)| = |G|$. Thus, the LHS simplifies to:\n$$\n\\text{LHS} = n_y |G|\n$$\nEquating this with the right-hand side of our original summed equation, we get:\n$$\nn_y |G| = \\sum_{\\chi \\in \\text{Irr}(G)} |G| \\nu(\\chi) \\overline{\\chi(y)}\n$$\nDividing by $|G|$ (which is non-zero), we obtain the desired general formula for $n_y$:\n$$\nn_y = \\sum_{\\chi \\in \\text{Irr}(G)} \\nu(\\chi) \\overline{\\chi(y)}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation for $Q_8$**\n\nNow we apply this formula to find $n_{-1}$ for the group $Q_8$.\nThe formula is $n_{-1} = \\sum_{\\chi \\in \\text{Irr}(Q_8)} \\nu(\\chi) \\overline{\\chi(-1)}$.\n\nFirst, we must calculate the Frobenius-Schur indicators $\\nu(\\chi)$ for all irreducible characters of $Q_8$.
