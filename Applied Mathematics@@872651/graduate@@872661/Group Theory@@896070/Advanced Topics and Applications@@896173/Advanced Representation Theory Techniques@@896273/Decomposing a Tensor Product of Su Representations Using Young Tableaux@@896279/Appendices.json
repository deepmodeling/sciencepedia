A Young diagram is a collection of boxes arranged in left-justified rows, with the length of the rows being non-increasing from top to bottom.

No two boxes with the same label may appear in the same column.\n    b. When reading the labels of the added boxes from right to left, row by row from top to bottom, at any point the number of boxes with label $k$ must be greater than or equal to the number of boxes with label $k+1$.\n\nFor SU(N), diagrams are subject to an equivalence relation.
