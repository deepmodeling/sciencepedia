The application of group theory can significantly simplify the calculation of molecular orbital energies by block-diagonalizing the Hückel secular determinant. The size of each block corresponds to the number of Symmetry Adapted Linear Combinations (SALCs) belonging to a particular irreducible representation (irrep) of the molecule's point group.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nConsider the furan molecule, a planar five-membered ring with chemical formula $\\text{C}_4\\text{H}_4\\text{O}$. For the purpose of analyzing its $\\pi$-electron system using HMO theory, we use a basis set consisting of five atomic orbitals, one on each of the ring atoms (four carbons and one oxygen).

The principal $C_2$ axis coincides with the $z$-axis and passes through the oxygen atom.\n3. The basis set for the $\\pi$-system consists of five atomic $p_x$ orbitals, one centered on each ring atom, oriented perpendicular to the molecular plane.\n4.
