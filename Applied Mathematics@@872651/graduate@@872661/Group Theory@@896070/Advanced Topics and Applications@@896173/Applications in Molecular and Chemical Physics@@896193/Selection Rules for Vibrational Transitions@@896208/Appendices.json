For a vibrational mode of a molecule to be \"active\" in Infrared (IR) spectroscopy, meaning it can be excited by the absorption of an IR photon, the electric dipole moment of the molecule must change during that mode of vibration.\n\nConsider the fundamental vibrational mode (bond stretching) of a gaseous fluorine molecule, $F_2$, which is a homonuclear diatomic molecule.

The transition is IR inactive because the molecule's polarizability does not change during the vibration.", "solution": "The fundamental principle governing the absorption of infrared radiation for vibrational transitions is that the electric dipole moment of the molecule must change as the atoms execute the vibrational motion. This condition is often expressed mathematically as $\\frac{d\\mu}{dq} \\neq 0$, where $\\mu$ is the electric dipole moment and $q$ is the normal coordinate representing the vibration. If this derivative is zero, the transition is \"forbidden\" or IR inactive.\n\nLet's analyze the fluorine molecule, $F_2$.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the structure and symmetry of the $F_2$ molecule.\nThe $F_2$ molecule is a homonuclear diatomic molecule, meaning it consists of two identical atoms (fluorine). Due to the identical electronegativity of the two atoms, the electron density is distributed perfectly symmetrically between them. Consequently, the molecule has no separation of positive and negative charge centers, and its permanent electric dipole moment, $\\mu_{eq}$, at the equilibrium bond distance is zero.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the effect of the vibration on the dipole moment.\nThe fundamental vibrational mode of a diatomic molecule is a simple stretching and compression of the bond along the internuclear axis.\n- When the bond is stretched, the two fluorine atoms move apart symmetrically from the center of mass. The molecule remains a symmetric, nonpolar entity. The dipole moment is still zero.\n- When the bond is compressed, the two fluorine atoms move closer together symmetrically. The molecule again remains symmetric and nonpolar. The dipole moment is still zero.\n\nAt every point during the vibrational motion, the symmetry of the molecule is preserved. Because the charge distribution remains perfectly symmetric throughout the entire vibrational cycle, the electric dipole moment $\\mu$ is zero for all bond lengths $r$ near the equilibrium position.\n\nStep 3: Apply the IR selection rule.\nSince the dipole moment $\\mu(q)$ is constant (it is zero) throughout the vibration, its rate of change with respect to the vibrational coordinate $q$ is also zero.\n$$ \\frac{d\\mu}{dq} = \\frac{d(0)}{dq} = 0 $$\nBecause this condition is met, the fundamental vibrational transition of $F_2$ is not IR active.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the given options.\nA. The transition is IR active because the vibration causes a periodic change in the bond length, which induces an oscillating dipole moment. This is incorrect. While the bond length does change, in a homonuclear diatomic molecule, this change does not induce a dipole moment due to the persistent symmetry.\n\nB. The transition is IR inactive because the fluorine molecule ($F_2$) has no permanent electric dipole moment. This statement is subtly misleading. While it is true that $F_2$ has no permanent dipole moment and is IR inactive, the lack of a permanent dipole is not the strict reason for inactivity. For example, the symmetric stretching mode of $CO_2$ is IR inactive, and $CO_2$ has no permanent dipole. However, the asymmetric stretching and bending modes of $CO_2$ are IR active, even though the molecule as a whole has no permanent dipole. The correct criterion is the *change* in dipole moment, not the existence of a *permanent* one.\n\nC. The transition is IR inactive because the electric dipole moment of the molecule does not change during the vibrational motion. This is the correct statement. As derived above, the dipole moment remains zero throughout the vibration, so $\\frac{d\\mu}{dq} = 0$. This correctly identifies the reason for the transition being IR inactive.\n\nD. The transition is IR active because fluorine is a highly electronegative element, leading to a strong interaction with the electric field of the radiation. This is incorrect. Although fluorine is very electronegative, in the $F_2$ molecule, the equal and opposite pull for electrons by the two identical atoms results in a nonpolar bond and a nonpolar molecule. The molecular property (symmetry), not the atomic property (electronegativity), dictates the IR activity.\n\nE. The transition is IR inactive because the molecule's polarizability does not change during the vibration. This statement confuses the selection rule for IR spectroscopy with the selection rule for Raman spectroscopy. Raman activity depends on a change in the molecule's polarizability during a vibration. In fact, the vibration of $F_2$ is Raman active precisely because the polarizability does change. This option states the wrong selection rule.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2021130"}, {"introduction": "Building on the basic rule, this practice challenges you to visualize vibrational modes in polyatomic molecules and qualitatively assess their IR activity.

Consider two different triatomic molecules and one specific vibrational mode for each.\n\n**Molecule 1: Water ($H_2O$)**\nThe equilibrium geometry of a water molecule is bent, with the oxygen atom at the vertex. For the *bending mode* of vibration, imagine the two hydrogen atoms moving symmetrically toward and away from each other, causing the H-O-H bond angle to decrease and increase periodically, much like a pair of scissors opening and closing. The O-H bond lengths remain approximately constant during this specific motion.\n\n**Molecule 2: Carbon Dioxide ($CO_2$)**\nThe equilibrium geometry of a carbon dioxide molecule is linear, with the carbon atom in the center (O=C=O). For the *symmetric stretching mode* of vibration, both oxygen atoms move simultaneously away from the central carbon atom and then simultaneously toward it, causing both C=O bonds to lengthen and shorten in phase. The molecule remains linear throughout this motion.\n\nBased on a qualitative analysis of how the net electric dipole moment changes during these vibrations, determine which of these modes is expected to be IR active.\n\nA. Both the $H_2O$ bending mode and the $CO_2$ symmetric stretching mode are IR active.\n\nB. Neither the $H_2O$ bending mode nor the $CO_2$ symmetric stretching mode is IR active.\n\nC. Only the $H_2O$ bending mode is IR active.\n\nD. Only the $CO_2$ symmetric stretching mode is IR active.\n\nE. IR activity cannot be determined from this information alone; the magnitude of the bond dipoles is required.", "solution": "Infrared activity for a vibrational normal mode with coordinate $Q$ requires that the molecular dipole moment vector $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ change during the vibration.

The two bond dipoles are separated by the angle $\\alpha$, and their vector sum lies along the angle bisector. The resultant dipole is\n$$\\boldsymbol{\\mu}(\\alpha) = 2 \\mu_{OH} \\cos\\!\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\,\\hat{\\boldsymbol{b}},$$\nwhere $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{b}}$ is the unit vector along the bisector, which remains fixed in direction during the symmetric bend. Since $\\mu_{OH}$ is approximately constant in this mode, differentiation with respect to the bending coordinate $Q$ (which changes $\\alpha$) yields\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\mu}}{\\partial Q} = \\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\mu}}{\\partial \\alpha}\\,\\frac{\\partial \\alpha}{\\partial Q} = \\left[-\\mu_{OH} \\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\right)\\,\\hat{\\boldsymbol{b}}\\right]\\frac{\\partial \\alpha}{\\partial Q} \\neq \\boldsymbol{0}.$$\nThus the $H_{2}O$ bending mode is IR active.\n\nFor $CO_{2}$ (linear) in the symmetric stretching mode, both C=O bonds lengthen and shorten in phase along the molecular axis while the molecule remains linear and centrosymmetric. Let the two bond dipoles have equal magnitudes $\\mu_{CO}$ and point along $+\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}$ and $-\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}$. By symmetry,\n$$\\boldsymbol{\\mu}(Q) = \\mu_{CO}(Q)\\,\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}} + \\mu_{CO}(Q)\\,(-\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}) = \\boldsymbol{0} \\quad \\text{for all } Q,$$\nso\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\mu}}{\\partial Q}\\right)_{Q=0} = \\boldsymbol{0}.$$\nHence the $CO_{2}$ symmetric stretch is IR inactive.\n\nTherefore, only the $H_{2}O$ bending mode is IR active, and the $CO_{2}$ symmetric stretching mode is IR inactive.
