We will focus on the fundamental representation, where the generators are represented by $5 \\times 5$ traceless Hermitian matrices.\n\nLet the basis for the fundamental representation $\\bar{\\mathbf{5}}$ be given by the column vector $\\Psi = (d^c_1, d^c_2, d^c_3, \\nu_L, e_L)^T$.

A basis for these generators can be constructed using the matrices $E_{ij}$, which have a 1 in the $(i, j)$ position and zeros elsewhere.
