This process, known as restriction, decomposes the representation into a direct sum of irreducible representations (irreps) of the subgroup $H$. This decomposition is governed by \"branching rules\".\n\nLet $G = S_5$ be the symmetric group on 5 elements. The permutation representation of $S_5$ is a 5-dimensional representation $\\rho_{\\text{perm}}$ acting on a vector space $V \\cong \\mathbb{C}^5$ by permuting basis vectors.
