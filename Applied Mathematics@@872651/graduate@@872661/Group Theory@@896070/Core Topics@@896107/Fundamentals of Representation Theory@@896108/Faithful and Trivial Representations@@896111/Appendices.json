We will analyze each of the five irreducible characters provided in the character table.\n\nLet $N$ be the number we want to compute. We need to check each character $\\chi_i$ for two properties:\n1.  **Faithfulness:** The kernel of the character, $\\ker(\\chi_i) = \\{g \\in S_4 \\mid \\chi_i(g) = \\chi_i(e)\\}$, must be the trivial group $\\{e\\}$, which only contains the identity element (class $1^4$).\n2.  **Trivial Determinant:** The determinant character associated with the representation must be the trivial character $\\chi_1$.\n\n**Step 1: Check for Faithfulness**\n\nWe check the kernel for each irreducible character $\\chi_i$. The identity element $e$ is in the conjugacy class $1^4$.\n\n*   **For $\\chi_1$:** $\\chi_1(e) = 1$. All elements $g \\in S_4$ have $\\chi_1(g)=1$. Thus, $\\ker(\\chi_1) = S_4$. The character is not faithful.\n\n*   **For $\\chi_2$:** $\\chi_2(e) = 1$. The elements $g$ for which $\\chi_2(g)=1$ belong to the conjugacy classes $1^4$, $(123)$, and $(12)(34)$. These are precisely the even permutations in $S_4$, which form the alternating group $A_4$. So, $\\ker(\\chi_2) = A_4$. The character is not faithful.\n\n*   **For $\\chi_3$:** $\\chi_3(e) = 2$. The elements $g$ for which $\\chi_3(g)=2$ belong to the conjugacy classes $1^4$ and $(12)(34)$. The conjugacy class of $(12)(34)$ contains 3 elements: $(12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)$. Together with the identity, these form the Klein four-group $V_4$. So, $\\ker(\\chi_3) = V_4$. The character is not faithful.\n\n*   **For $\\chi_4$:** $\\chi_4(e) = 3$. Looking at the row for $\\chi_4$, no other conjugacy class has a character value of 3. Therefore, the only element $g$ with $\\chi_4(g)=3$ is the identity element. So, $\\ker(\\chi_4) = \\{e\\}$. The character is faithful.\n\n*   **For $\\chi_5$:** $\\chi_5(e) = 3$. Similarly, no other conjugacy class has a character value of 3. So, $\\ker(\\chi_5) = \\{e\\}$. The character is faithful.\n\nFrom this analysis, only two irreducible characters are faithful: $\\chi_4$ and $\\chi_5$.\n\n**Step 2: Check for Trivial Determinant**\n\nNow we examine the determinant character for the faithful characters, $\\chi_4$ and $\\chi_5$. As stated in the problem, the determinant character must be either $\\chi_1$ (trivial) or $\\chi_2$ (sign).\n\n*   **For $\\chi_4$:** This character corresponds to the standard representation of $S_4$. The standard representation of $S_n$ for $n \\geq 2$ has the sign character as its determinant character. A short argument for this is that the permutation representation $\\rho_{perm}$ on $\\mathbb{C}^n$ decomposes into the standard representation $\\rho_{std}$ and the trivial representation $\\rho_{triv}$. So, $\\rho_{perm} \\cong \\rho_{std} \\oplus \\rho_{triv}$. The determinant of a permutation matrix corresponding to a permutation $g$ is $\\text{sgn}(g)$. Thus, $\\det(\\rho_{perm}(g)) = \\text{sgn}(g)$. We also have $\\det(\\rho_{perm}(g)) = \\det(\\rho_{std}(g)) \\cdot \\det(\\rho_{triv}(g))$. Since $\\rho_{triv}$ is the trivial representation, $\\det(\\rho_{triv}(g))=1$ for all $g$. Therefore, $\\det(\\rho_{std}(g)) = \\text{sgn}(g)$. The character corresponding to $g \\mapsto \\text{sgn}(g)$ is the sign character $\\chi_2$.\n    So, the determinant character for $\\chi_4$ is $\\chi_2$, which is not trivial. Thus, $\\chi_4$ does not have a trivial determinant.\n\n*   **For $\\chi_5$:** Let's find the determinant character for $\\chi_5$. We can observe from the character table that the values of $\\chi_5$ are the product of the values of $\\chi_4$ and $\\chi_2$:\n    $\\chi_5(g) = \\chi_4(g) \\chi_2(g)$ for all $g \\in S_4$.\n    This means that the representation $\\rho_5$ corresponding to $\\chi_5$ is equivalent to the tensor product of the representations for $\\chi_4$ and $\\chi_2$: $\\rho_5 \\cong \\rho_4 \\otimes \\rho_2$.\n    Let $d = \\chi_4(e) = 3$ be the dimension of $\\rho_4$. The representation $\\rho_2$ is one-dimensional, so $\\rho_2(g)$ is the scalar value $\\chi_2(g)$. The determinant of the tensor product representation is given by:\n    $$ \\det(\\rho_5(g)) = \\det(\\rho_4(g) \\otimes \\rho_2(g)) = (\\det(\\rho_4(g)))^{\\dim(\\rho_2)} \\cdot (\\det(\\rho_2(g)))^{\\dim(\\rho_4)} $$\n    Since $\\dim(\\rho_2)=1$ and $\\dim(\\rho_4)=d=3$, this becomes:\n    $$ \\det(\\rho_5(g)) = \\det(\\rho_4(g)) \\cdot (\\chi_2(g))^3 $$\n    We know that $\\chi_2(g) \\in \\{1, -1\\}$, so $(\\chi_2(g))^3 = \\chi_2(g)$. Also, we've established that the determinant character for $\\chi_4$ is $\\chi_2$, so $\\det(\\rho_4(g)) = \\chi_2(g)$. Substituting these in:\n    $$ \\det(\\rho_5(g)) = \\chi_2(g) \\cdot \\chi_2(g) = (\\chi_2(g))^2 $$\n    Since $\\chi_2(g)$ is either 1 or -1, $(\\chi_2(g))^2 = 1$ for all $g \\in S_4$. This corresponds to the trivial character $\\chi_1$.\n    Thus, the determinant character for $\\chi_5$ is $\\chi_1$, which means it has a trivial determinant.\n\n**Step 3: Final Count**\n\nWe have found the properties of all five irreducible characters:\n*   $\\chi_1$: Not faithful.\n*   $\\chi_2$: Not faithful.\n*   $\\chi_3$: Not faithful.\n*   $\\chi_4$: Faithful, determinant is not trivial.\n*   $\\chi_5$: Faithful, determinant is trivial.\n\nThere is exactly one irreducible character of $S_4$, namely $\\chi_5$, that is both faithful and has a trivial determinant.\nThe total number is 1.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "675206"}, {"introduction": "Beyond analyzing individual representations, a key skill is understanding how they combine.
