By translating these abstract algebraic rules into matrix equations, we can uncover deep properties of the representation. This exercise focuses on using the group presentation for the dicyclic group $Dic_3$, along with the crucial requirement of faithfulness, to constrain the possible matrices and ultimately determine the character of a generator. This practice [@problem_id:663093] demonstrates how abstract axioms directly shape the concrete linear-algebraic structure of a representation.", "problem": "The dicyclic group $Dic_n$ is a non-abelian group of order $4n$ defined by the presentation\n$$\nDic_n = \\langle a, x \\mid a^{2n} = e, x^2 = a^n, x^{-1}ax = a^{-1} \\rangle,\n$$\nwhere $e$ is the identity element. For $n=3$, the group is $Dic_3$, of order 12. It is also known as the binary tetrahedral group.\n\nThis group $Dic_3$ possesses a unique (up to equivalence) 2-dimensional faithful irreducible representation over the field of complex numbers, denoted by $D: Dic_3 \\to GL(2, \\mathbb{C})$. Let $A = D(a)$ and $X = D(x)$ be the $2 \\times 2$ complex matrices corresponding to the generators $a$ and $x$, respectively.\n\nYour task is to determine the value of the character of the group element $a$ in this representation. The character $\\chi(g)$ of a group element $g$ is defined as the trace of its representative matrix, $\\chi(g) = \\text{Tr}(D(g))$. Specifically, you are to find the value of $\\chi(a) = \\text{Tr}(A)$.", "solution": "Let the 2-dimensional representation be $D$, with $A=D(a)$ and $X=D(x)$. The group presentation for $Dic_3$ imposes the following relations on these matrices:\n1.  $A^6 = I$\n2.  $X^2 = A^3$\n3.  $X^{-1}AX = A^{-1}$\n\nHere, $I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix. The character of $a$ is $\\chi(a) = \\text{Tr}(A)$, which is the sum of the eigenvalues of $A$. Let the eigenvalues of $A$ be $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$. So, $\\chi(a) = \\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2$.\n\nFrom relation (3), $X^{-1}AX = A^{-1}$, we see that the matrices $A$ and $A^{-1}$ are similar (related by a conjugation). Similar matrices have the same eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of $A^{-1}$ are $\\lambda_1^{-1}$ and $\\lambda_2^{-1}$. Therefore, the set of eigenvalues must be the same:\n$$\n\\{\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2\\} = \\{\\lambda_1^{-1}, \\lambda_2^{-1}\\}\n$$\nThis equality of sets implies one of two possibilities:\n(i) $\\lambda_1 = \\lambda_1^{-1}$ and $\\lambda_2 = \\lambda_2^{-1}$. This means $\\lambda_1^2 = 1$ and $\\lambda_2^2=1$, so the eigenvalues are from the set $\\{1, -1\\}$.\n(ii) $\\lambda_2 = \\lambda_1^{-1}$.\n\nFrom relation (1), $A^6 = I$, the eigenvalues of $A$ must be 6th roots of unity. That is, $\\lambda^6 = 1$ for $\\lambda \\in \\{\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2\\}$. The 6th roots of unity are given by $e^{2\\pi i k/6} = e^{i\\pi k/3}$ for $k=0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5$.\n\nNow we analyze the possibilities in light of the fact that the representation must be faithful. A representation $D$ is faithful if its kernel is trivial, i.e., $\\ker(D) = \\{g \\in G \\mid D(g) = I\\} = \\{e\\}$. This means that for any element $g \\ne e$, its representative matrix $D(g)$ must not be the identity matrix $I$.\n\nLet's examine case (i): Eigenvalues are $\\pm 1$.\nThe possible pairs $(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2)$ are $(1,1)$, $(-1,-1)$, and $(1,-1)$.\n- If $(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2)=(1,1)$, then $A$ is similar to the identity matrix $I$. Since the only matrix similar to $I$ is $I$ itself, $A=I$. This implies $D(a)=I$. But $a \\ne e$, so $a \\in \\ker(D)$. The representation is not faithful.\n- If $(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2)=(-1,-1)$, then $A$ is similar to $-I$, so $A=-I$. Then $A^2 = (-I)^2=I$. This means $D(a^2) = D(a)^2 = A^2 = I$. Since $a^2 \\ne e$, $a^2 \\in \\ker(D)$. The representation is not faithful.\n- If $(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2)=(1,-1)$, then $A$ is diagonalizable with eigenvalues $1, -1$. Then $A^2$ has eigenvalues $1^2, (-1)^2$, i.e., $(1,1)$. So $A^2$ is similar to $I$, meaning $A^2=I$. Again, $D(a^2)=I$, so the representation is not faithful.\nThus, case (i) does not lead to a faithful representation.\n\nWe must be in case (ii): $\\lambda_2 = \\lambda_1^{-1}$. Let $\\lambda_1 = \\lambda$. The eigenvalues are $\\{\\lambda, \\lambda^{-1}\\}$.\nFor the representation to be faithful, $D(a^k) = A^k$ cannot be the identity matrix for $k \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$. If $A^k=I$, its eigenvalues $\\lambda^k$ and $\\lambda^{-k}$ must both be 1. This means $\\lambda$ must be a $k$-th root of unity.\nSo, for faithfulness, $\\lambda$ cannot be a $k$-th root of unity for $k=1, 2, 3, 4, 5$.\nThe possible values for $\\lambda$ are the 6th roots of unity.\n- If $\\lambda$ is a 1st root of unity ($\\lambda=1$, $k=1$), we have case (i). Not faithful.\n- If $\\lambda$ is a 2nd root of unity ($\\lambda=-1$, $k=2$), we have case (i). Not faithful.\n- If $\\lambda$ is a 3rd root of unity (e.g., $e^{i2\\pi/3}$), then $\\lambda^3=1$, so $A^3=I$. Not faithful.\nTherefore, $\\lambda$ must be a primitive 6th root of unity. The primitive 6th roots of unity are $e^{i\\pi/3}$ and $e^{i5\\pi/3} = e^{-i\\pi/3}$.\n\nLet's choose $\\lambda_1 = e^{i\\pi/3}$. Then $\\lambda_2 = \\lambda_1^{-1} = e^{-i\\pi/3}$. The set of eigenvalues for $A$ is $\\{e^{i\\pi/3}, e^{-i\\pi/3}\\}$.\n(If we chose $\\lambda_1 = e^{i5\\pi/3}$, then $\\lambda_2 = e^{-i5\\pi/3} = e^{i\\pi/3}$, which gives the same set of eigenvalues. The resulting representation would be equivalent).\n\nWith this set of eigenvalues, a consistent representation can be constructed. For instance, with a suitable choice of basis, $A = \\begin{pmatrix} e^{i\\pi/3} & 0 \\\\ 0 & e^{-i\\pi/3} \\end{pmatrix}$. Then $A^3 = \\begin{pmatrix} (e^{i\\pi/3})^3 & 0 \\\\ 0 & (e^{-i\\pi/3})^3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} e^{i\\pi} & 0 \\\\ 0 & e^{-i\\pi} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 \\end{pmatrix} = -I$. Relation (2) becomes $X^2 = -I$. A matrix $X$ satisfying this and relation (3) can be found, for example $X = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$. This confirms the consistency of our eigenvalue choice.\n\nThe character $\\chi(a)$ is the trace of $A$, which is the sum of its eigenvalues:\n$$\n\\chi(a) = \\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2 = e^{i\\pi/3} + e^{-i\\pi/3}\n$$\nUsing Euler's formula, $e^{i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta$:\n$$\n\\chi(a) = \\left(\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{3} + i\\sin\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) + \\left(\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{3} - i\\sin\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = 2\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{3}\n$$\nThe value of $\\cos(\\pi/3)$ is $1/2$.\n$$\n\\chi(a) = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 1\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1}\n$$", "id": "663093"}, {"introduction": "New representations can often be constructed from existing ones via group homomorphisms.
