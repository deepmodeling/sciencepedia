For the symmetric group $S_n$, a particularly important irreducible representation is the so-called \"standard representation,\" denoted $\\Gamma_{std}$.

The characters for the representations above are related by $\\chi_{perm}(g) = \\chi_{triv}(g) + \\chi_{std}(g)$. The character of the permutation representation, $\\chi_{perm}(g)$, is equal to the number of elements left fixed by the permutation $g$. The character of the trivial representation is $\\chi_{triv}(g) = 1$ for all $g \\in S_n$.
