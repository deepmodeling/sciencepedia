For $\\phi$ to be a homomorphism, the images $h_1, h_2 \\in A_4$ must satisfy the corresponding relations in the group $A_4$ (which is multiplicative).\nThe relations translate to:\n1.  $h_1^4 = e$, where $e$ is the identity element in $A_4$. This means the order of $h_1$, denoted $\\text{ord}(h_1)$, must divide 4.\n2.  $h_2^2 = e$. This means $\\text{ord}(h_2)$ must divide 2.\n3.  $h_1 h_2 = h_2 h_1$. The images must commute.\n\nWe need to find the number of pairs $(h_1, h_2)$ in $A_4$ that satisfy these three conditions.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the structure of $A_4$. As given in the problem statement, the orders of elements in $A_4$ can only be 1, 2, or 3.\n-   Number of elements of order 1: 1 (the identity, $e$).\n-   Number of elements of order 2: 3 (these are of the form $(ab)(cd)$, e.g., $(12)(34)$).\n-   Number of elements of order 3: 8 (these are 3-cycles, e.g., $(123)$).\n\nNow we apply the conditions:\n**Condition 1: Find all possible choices for $h_1$.**\nThe condition is $h_1^4 = e$, so $\\text{ord}(h_1)$ must divide 4. The possible orders of elements in $A_4$ are 1, 2, and 3. The only orders that divide 4 are 1 and 2.\nTherefore, $h_1$ must be an element of order 1 or 2.\nThe elements of order 1 or 2 in $A_4$ are the identity $e$ and the three elements of order 2.\nLet $V = \\{e, (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)\\}$. This set contains all elements of $A_4$ whose order divides 2. It is known as the Klein four-group and is a subgroup of $A_4$.\nThe number of choices for $h_1$ is the number of elements in this set, which is $|V| = 4$.\n\n**Condition 2: Find all possible choices for $h_2$.**\nThe condition is $h_2^2 = e$, so $\\text{ord}(h_2)$ must divide 2. This means $\\text{ord}(h_2)$ can be 1 or 2.\nThese are precisely the same elements as those available for $h_1$. Thus, $h_2$ must also be an element of the set $V$.\nThe number of choices for $h_2$ is $|V| = 4$.\n\n**Condition 3: Check the commutation relation $h_1 h_2 = h_2 h_1$.**\nWe have determined that both $h_1$ and $h_2$ must belong to the set $V = \\{e, (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)\\}$.
