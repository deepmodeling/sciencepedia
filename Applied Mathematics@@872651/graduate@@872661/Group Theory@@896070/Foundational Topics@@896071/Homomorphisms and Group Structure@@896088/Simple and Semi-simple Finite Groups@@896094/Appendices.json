The cycle structure of a permutation determines its order. The possible cycle structures for even permutations in $S_5$ are:\n1.  The identity: (1). Cycle structure $1^5$. The order is 1.\n2.  3-cycles: (abc). Cycle structure $3^1 1^2$. The order is 3.\n3.  5-cycles: (abcde). Cycle structure $5^1$. The order is 5.\n4.  Pairs of disjoint 2-cycles (transpositions): (ab)(cd). Cycle structure $2^2 1^1$. The order is 2.\n\nOther cycle structures in $S_5$, like a single 2-cycle (odd), a 4-cycle (odd), or a 3-cycle with a 2-cycle (odd), are not in $A_5$.\nThus, the set of possible orders of elements in $A_5$ is $\\{1, 2, 3, 5\\}$.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the maximal order of an element in $G = A_5 \\times A_5$.**\nThe order of an element $g = (g_1, g_2) \\in G$ is $o(g) = \\text{lcm}(o(g_1), o(g_2))$, where $o(g_1)$ and $o(g_2)$ can be any value from the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 5\\}$.
