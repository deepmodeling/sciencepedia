The group operation is the composition of permutations. A key property of any permutation $\\sigma \\in S_n$ is its sign, or signature, denoted by $\\text{sgn}(\\sigma)$.\n\nAny permutation can be expressed as a composition (product) of transpositions. A transposition is a permutation that swaps two elements and keeps all others fixed, represented by the cycle notation $(i, j)$. While the decomposition of a permutation into transpositions is not unique, the parity of the number of transpositions is always the same. If a permutation $\\sigma$ can be written as a product of $k$ transpositions, its sign is defined as:\n$$\n\\text{sgn}(\\sigma) = (-1)^k\n$$\nA permutation is called even if its sign is $+1$ and odd if its sign is $-1$.\n\nAlternatively, the sign of a permutation can be determined by counting its inversions. An inversion of a permutation $\\sigma$ is a pair of indices $(i, j)$ such that $i < j$ but $\\sigma(i) > \\sigma(j)$.

By analyzing the swaps performed during a single pass of a sorting algorithm, you will see how an algorithmic process naturally corresponds to a product of transpositions.

We are given the initial sequence $A_0 = (2, 3, \\dots, n, 1)$.\n\nThis sequence is processed by one full pass of the cocktail shaker sort algorithm. A full pass is defined as a forward pass followed by a backward pass.\n1.  **Forward Pass:** The algorithm iterates from $i=1$ to $n-1$. In each step, it compares the adjacent elements $A[i]$ and $A[i+1]$. If $A[i] > A[i+1]$, the elements are swapped. The sequence is updated after each potential swap.\n2.  **Backward Pass:** After the forward pass is complete, the algorithm operates on the resulting sequence. It iterates from $i=n-1$ down to $1$. In each step, it compares the adjacent elements $A[i]$ and $A[i+1]$. If $A[i] > A[i+1]$, the elements are swapped.\n\nEach swap of two elements corresponds to a transposition. The permutation $\\pi_n$ induced by this full pass is the composition of all transpositions performed.
