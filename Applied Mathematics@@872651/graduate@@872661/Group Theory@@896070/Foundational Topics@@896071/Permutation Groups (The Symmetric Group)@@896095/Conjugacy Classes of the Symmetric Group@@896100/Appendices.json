This exercise provides a concrete foundation for understanding the direct correspondence between cycle structures and conjugacy classes. By explicitly enumerating all permutations and grouping them by their cycle type, you will see how the group neatly partitions into these classes, a core concept in the study of symmetric groups [@problem_id:1609685].", "problem": "The symmetric group $S_3$ is defined as the group of all permutations of a set of three distinct elements, which we can label as $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$. Two elements $g_1$ and $g_2$ within a group $G$ are said to be conjugate if there exists an element $h \\in G$ such that $g_2 = h g_1 h^{-1}$. The relation of conjugacy partitions the group into disjoint subsets known as conjugacy classes. Determine the sizes (i.e., the number of elements) of each of the distinct conjugacy classes of the group $S_3$. List these sizes as a set of integers in increasing order.", "solution": "We consider $S_{3}$, the group of all permutations of $\\{1,2,3\\}$, which has order $|S_{3}|=6$. Two elements $g_{1},g_{2} \\in S_{3}$ are conjugate if there exists $h \\in S_{3}$ such that $g_{2}=h g_{1} h^{-1}$.\n\nKey principle: In $S_{n}$, two permutations are conjugate if and only if they have the same cycle structure. To see this:\n- If $g \\in S_{n}$ has a cycle decomposition, then for any $h \\in S_{n}$, the permutation $h g h^{-1}$ is obtained by relabeling the symbols via $h$, which preserves the lengths and multiplicities of cycles; hence conjugation preserves cycle type.\n- Conversely, if two permutations have the same cycle structure, one can choose a bijection $h$ that maps each element in the cycles of the first permutation to the corresponding element in the cycles of the second permutation, cycle by cycle, which yields $g_{2}=h g_{1} h^{-1}$.\n\nThus, conjugacy classes in $S_{3}$ correspond exactly to the distinct cycle types in $S_{3}$. The possible cycle types are:\n1) The identity permutation, with cycle structure $(1)(2)(3)$. There is exactly $1$ such element.\n2) Transpositions (2-cycles) with one fixed point, e.g., $(12)$, $(13)$, $(23)$. The number of transpositions in $S_{3}$ is $\\binom{3}{2}=3$.\n3) 3-cycles, e.g., $(123)$ and $(132)$. The number of 3-cycles in $S_{3}$ is $2$ (equivalently, the general count of $n$-cycles in $S_{n}$ is $(n-1)!$, giving $2$ when $n=3$).\n\nTherefore, the conjugacy classes have sizes $1$, $3$, and $2$, respectively. As a check, their sum $1+3+2=6$ equals $|S_{3}|$, as required. Listed in increasing order, the sizes are $1,2,3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\{1, 2, 3\\}}$$", "id": "1609685"}, {"introduction": "A natural question that arises is whether all elements of the same order must belong to the same conjugacy class.

All elements of order 2 are conjugate to each other, forming a single conjugacy class.\nB. The elements of order 2 partition into exactly two distinct conjugacy classes.\nC. The elements of order 2 partition into exactly three distinct conjugacy classes.\nD. No two distinct elements of order 2 are conjugate to each other; each forms its own conjugacy class of size one.\nE.

Therefore, in $S_{n}$, two permutations are conjugate if and only if they have the same cycle type.\n\nThe order of a permutation equals the least common multiple of the lengths of its disjoint cycles. To have order $2$, all cycle lengths must divide $2$, and at least one cycle must have length $2$. Thus, the only possible cycle types in $S_{4}$ for elements of order $2$ are:\n- A single transposition with two fixed points, i.e., cycle type $(2)(1)(1)$.\n- A product of two disjoint transpositions, i.e., cycle type $(2)(2)$.\n\nNo other cycle types in $S_{4}$ have order $2$, since a $3$-cycle has order $3$ and a $4$-cycle has order $4$, while the identity has order $1$.\n\nBy the conjugacy criterion above, elements with cycle type $(2)(1)(1)$ form one conjugacy class, and elements with cycle type $(2)(2)$ form another conjugacy class. These two classes are distinct because conjugation preserves cycle type, so an element of type $(2)(1)(1)$ cannot be conjugate to one of type $(2)(2)$.\n\nHence, the elements of order $2$ in $S_{4}$ partition into exactly two distinct conjugacy classes.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1608909"}, {"introduction": "Having established the conceptual framework, we now turn to a powerful computational tool for determining the size of any conjugacy class in $S_n$.
