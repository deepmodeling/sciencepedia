This practice explores a degenerate node, a scenario where a repeated eigenvalue yields only a single eigendirection.

The primary asset is expected to grow exponentially at a rate $r$. The secondary asset also grows at the same intrinsic rate $r$, but it is further boosted by a continuous reinvestment strategy, where a portion of the capital from the primary asset is effectively transferred to the secondary one.

The origin $(0,0)$ is a fixed point of the system.\n\nFirst, we find the eigenvalues of $A$ by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0$.\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} r - \\lambda  0 \\\\ \\beta  r - \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = (r - \\lambda)(r - \\lambda) - (0)(\\beta) = (r - \\lambda)^2 = 0\n$$\nThis equation yields a repeated eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = \\lambda_2 = r$. Since $r$ is given as a positive constant, we have a repeated positive eigenvalue. This implies that the fixed point at the origin is an unstable node, meaning all trajectories (except for the fixed point itself) will move away from the origin as $t \\rightarrow \\infty$. This information allows us to eliminate option C, which describes a saddle point, and any possibility of trajectories moving towards the origin.\n\nNext, we find the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda = r$. We seek a non-zero vector $\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\end{pmatrix}$ such that $(A - rI)\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}$.\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} r-r  0 \\\\ \\beta  r-r \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0 \\\\ \\beta  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\\\ v_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis matrix equation simplifies to the single scalar equation $\\beta v_1 = 0$. Since $\\beta > 0$, we must have $v_1 = 0$. The component $v_2$ is arbitrary. Therefore, the eigenvectors are of the form $\\mathbf{v} = k \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$ for any non-zero scalar $k$.\n\nSince there is only a one-dimensional eigenspace (spanned by the vector $\\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$) for a two-dimensional system, the origin is a degenerate (or improper) unstable node.\nThis rules out option A, which describes a star node where all directions are eigendirections. It also rules out option B, which describes a spiral, as spirals correspond to complex eigenvalues.\n\nThe single eigendirection, along the y-axis, corresponds to the only straight-line trajectories in the phase portrait. If a trajectory starts on the y-axis (i.e., $x(0) = 0$ and $y(0) \\neq 0$), it will move along the y-axis. As the eigenvalue $r$ is positive, it will move away from the origin. This matches the first part of the statement in option D.\n\nTo understand the behavior of other trajectories (where $x(0) \\neq 0$), we can solve the system explicitly.\nThe first equation, $\\frac{dx}{dt} = rx$, has the solution $x(t) = x_0 e^{rt}$, where $x_0 = x(0)$.\nSubstituting this into the second equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dt} = \\beta (x_0 e^{rt}) + ry \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{dy}{dt} - ry = \\beta x_0 e^{rt}\n$$\nThis is a linear first-order ordinary differential equation for $y(t)$. We can solve it using an integrating factor $I(t) = \\exp\\left(\\int -r \\, dt\\right) = e^{-rt}$. Multiplying the equation by $I(t)$:\n$$\ne^{-rt}\\frac{dy}{dt} - r e^{-rt} y = \\beta x_0\n$$\nThe left side is the derivative of a product: $\\frac{d}{dt}(y e^{-rt}) = \\beta x_0$.\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $t$:\n$$\ny(t)e^{-rt} = \\beta x_0 t + C\n$$\nUsing the initial condition $y(0)=y_0$, we find $y_0 e^0 = \\beta x_0(0) + C$, so $C=y_0$.\nThe solution for $y(t)$ is $y(t) = (\\beta x_0 t + y_0)e^{rt}$.\n\nThe complete solution for a trajectory starting at $(x_0, y_0)$ is:\n$$\nx(t) = x_0 e^{rt}\n$$\n$$\ny(t) = (\\beta x_0 t + y_0)e^{rt}\n$$\nTo analyze the shape of the trajectories for large $t$, let's consider the ratio of $y(t)$ to $x(t)$ for trajectories where $x_0 \\neq 0$:\n$$\n\\frac{y(t)}{x(t)} = \\frac{(\\beta x_0 t + y_0)e^{rt}}{x_0 e^{rt}} = \\beta t + \\frac{y_0}{x_0}\n$$\nAs $t \\rightarrow \\infty$, since $\\beta > 0$, the ratio $\\frac{y(t)}{x(t)} \\rightarrow \\infty$. A trajectory for which the ratio $y/x$ approaches infinity becomes tangent to a vertical line. This means the trajectories become increasingly parallel to the y-axis as they move away from the origin.\n\nThis confirms the behavior described in option D: trajectories starting off the y-axis are curved and become asymptotically parallel to the y-axis (the eigendirection) as $t \\to \\infty$. Option E incorrectly identifies the x-axis as the special direction.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that accurately describes the phase portrait is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1698959"}, {"introduction": "Linear systems are the building blocks for analyzing more complex nonlinear dynamics.
