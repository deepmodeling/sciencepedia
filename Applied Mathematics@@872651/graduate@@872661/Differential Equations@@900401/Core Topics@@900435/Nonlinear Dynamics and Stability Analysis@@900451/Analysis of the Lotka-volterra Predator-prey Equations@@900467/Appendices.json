The interaction between the two species is modeled using the classic Lotka-Volterra equations:\n\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = rN - aNP\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = baNP - mP\n$$\n\nHere, $N(t)$ is the population size of the prey and $P(t)$ is the population size of the predator at time $t$. The parameters are defined as follows:\n- $r$: The intrinsic per-capita growth rate of the prey in the absence of predators.\n- $a$: The attack rate, a measure of how frequently a predator encounters and captures a prey.\n- $b$: The conversion efficiency, representing the average number of new predators produced for each prey consumed.\n- $m$: The per-capita mortality rate of the predator in the absence of prey.\n\nAfter many generations, the ecologist observes an evolutionary adaptation in the prey species. The prey has started to consume a specific type of native plant containing a non-lethal toxin, which then gets stored in the prey's tissues. This makes the prey less nutritionally valuable to the predators; for each prey individual consumed, the predator gains significantly less energy for growth and reproduction than it did before.\n\nTo modify the Lotka-Volterra model to reflect this specific evolutionary change in the prey's nutritional quality, which single parameter should be decreased?\n\nA. $r$\n\nB. $a$\n\nC. $b$\n\nD. $m$", "solution": "We start from the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model:\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = rN - aNP,\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = baNP - mP.\n$$\nBiologically, in the predator equation the term $aNP$ represents the predation rate, i.e., the number of prey consumed per unit time (proportional to encounters and captures). The factor $b$ multiplies $aNP$ to convert prey consumed into predator population increase; thus $b$ is the conversion efficiency, the number of new predators produced per prey consumed. The predator per-capita growth rate is\n$$\n\\frac{1}{P}\\frac{dP}{dt} = baN - m.\n$$\nThe described evolutionary change makes each prey yield less energy to predators when consumed, which reduces the number of new predators produced per prey consumed. In the model, the predation rate $aNP$ (captures per unit time) is not changed by nutritional quality, and the predator baseline mortality $m$ is unaffected by prey quality. The prey’s intrinsic growth rate $r$ concerns prey reproduction in the absence of predators and is not the parameter that represents predator energetic gain from prey. Therefore, the single parameter that directly encodes the energetic conversion from consumed prey into predator growth and reproduction is $b$, and a reduction in nutritional value corresponds to decreasing $b$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1861216"}, {"introduction": "A powerful feature of systems of differential equations is their ability to describe the evolution of populations from any starting point.
