In a cylindrical coordinate system $(\\rho, \\phi, z)$, the interior of the pipe is defined by the region $0 \\le \\rho \\le R$, $0 \\le \\phi \\le \\pi/2$. The two flat surfaces of the pipe, one located on the plane $\\phi=0$ and the other on the plane $\\phi=\\pi/2$, are both held at zero potential (grounded).

Assuming the region inside the pipe is free of charge, determine the electrostatic potential $V(\\rho, \\phi)$ at any point within the pipe's interior. Express your answer as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $\\rho, \\phi, R,$ and $V_0$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the electrostatic potential $V(\\rho, \\phi)$ inside a long pipe with a specific cross-section and boundary conditions. Since the pipe is very long, we can neglect any dependence on the $z$-coordinate, effectively treating this as a two-dimensional problem in polar/cylindrical coordinates. The region inside is charge-free, so the potential $V$ must satisfy Laplace's equation. In two-dimensional cylindrical coordinates, Laplace's equation is:\n$$ \\nabla^2 V = \\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\rho} \\left( \\rho \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial \\rho} \\right) + \\frac{1}{\\rho^2} \\frac{\\partial^2 V}{\\partial \\phi^2} = 0 $$\nWe will solve this partial differential equation using the method of separation of variables. We assume a solution of the form $V(\\rho, \\phi) = P(\\rho)\\Phi(\\phi)$. Substituting this into Laplace's equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{\\Phi(\\phi)}{\\rho} \\frac{d}{d\\rho} \\left( \\rho \\frac{d P}{d\\rho} \\right) + \\frac{P(\\rho)}{\\rho^2} \\frac{d^2 \\Phi}{d\\phi^2} = 0 $$\nMultiplying by $\\frac{\\rho^2}{P(\\rho)\\Phi(\\phi)}$ allows us to separate the variables:\n$$ \\frac{\\rho}{P(\\rho)} \\frac{d}{d\\rho} \\left( \\rho \\frac{d P}{d\\rho} \\right) = - \\frac{1}{\\Phi(\\phi)} \\frac{d^2 \\Phi}{d\\phi^2} $$\nSince the left side depends only on $\\rho$ and the right side depends only on $\\phi$, both must be equal to a constant. Let's call this separation constant $k^2$. This gives us two ordinary differential equations:\n1. The angular equation: $\\frac{d^2 \\Phi}{d\\phi^2} + k^2 \\Phi = 0$\n2. The radial equation: $\\rho \\frac{d}{d\\rho} \\left( \\rho \\frac{d P}{d\\rho} \\right) - k^2 P = 0$, which can be rewritten as $\\rho^2 \\frac{d^2 P}{d\\rho^2} + \\rho \\frac{d P}{d\\rho} - k^2 P = 0$.\n\nFirst, we solve the angular equation. The general solution is $\\Phi(\\phi) = A \\sin(k\\phi) + B \\cos(k\\phi)$. We apply the boundary conditions on the flat, grounded walls:\n- At $\\phi=0$, the potential is $V=0$. This means $V(\\rho, 0) = P(\\rho)\\Phi(0) = 0$. For a non-trivial solution ($P(\\rho) \\neq 0$), we must have $\\Phi(0)=0$.\n  $\\Phi(0) = A \\sin(0) + B \\cos(0) = B = 0$.\n  So, the angular solution simplifies to $\\Phi(\\phi) = A \\sin(k\\phi)$.\n- At $\\phi=\\pi/2$, the potential is $V=0$. This means $V(\\rho, \\pi/2) = P(\\rho)\\Phi(\\pi/2) = 0$. This requires $\\Phi(\\pi/2)=0$.\n  $\\Phi(\\pi/2) = A \\sin(k\\pi/2) = 0$.\n  We need a non-trivial solution, so $A \\neq 0$. This implies $\\sin(k\\pi/2) = 0$, which is true if $k\\pi/2 = n\\pi$ for any integer $n$. Thus, $k=2n$, where $n=1, 2, 3, \\ldots$. (We exclude $n=0$ as it gives a trivial solution $\\Phi=0$).\nThe allowed angular solutions are of the form $\\Phi_n(\\phi) = A_n \\sin(2n\\phi)$.\n\nNext, we solve the radial equation for each allowed value of $k=2n$:\n$$ \\rho^2 \\frac{d^2 P}{d\\rho^2} + \\rho \\frac{d P}{d\\rho} - (2n)^2 P = 0 $$\nThis is a Cauchy-Euler equation. We look for solutions of the form $P(\\rho) = \\rho^m$. Substituting this in gives $m(m-1) + m - (2n)^2 = 0$, which simplifies to $m^2 = (2n)^2$, so $m = \\pm 2n$.\nThe general solution for the radial part is $P_n(\\rho) = C_n \\rho^{2n} + D_n \\rho^{-2n}$.\nFor the potential to be well-behaved and finite at the center of the pipe ($\\rho=0$), the term with the negative power of $\\rho$ must be excluded. Therefore, we must set $D_n = 0$ for all $n$.\nThe radial solutions are $P_n(\\rho) = C_n \\rho^{2n}$.\n\nCombining the radial and angular solutions for each $n$, a single solution is $V_n(\\rho, \\phi) = P_n(\\rho)\\Phi_n(\\phi) = C_n \\rho^{2n} \\sin(2n\\phi)$ (where the constant $A_n$ is absorbed into $C_n$).\nThe most general solution is a linear superposition of all possible solutions:\n$$ V(\\rho, \\phi) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty C_n \\rho^{2n} \\sin(2n\\phi) $$\nNow, we apply the final boundary condition at the curved wall, $\\rho=R$:\n$$ V(R, \\phi) = V_0 \\sin(2\\phi) $$\nSubstituting $\\rho=R$ into our general solution:\n$$ V(R, \\phi) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty C_n R^{2n} \\sin(2n\\phi) = C_1 R^2 \\sin(2\\phi) + C_2 R^4 \\sin(4\\phi) + C_3 R^6 \\sin(6\\phi) + \\ldots $$\nBy comparing the series with the given boundary condition, $V_0 \\sin(2\\phi)$, we can equate the coefficients of the basis functions $\\sin(2n\\phi)$. This is equivalent to performing a Fourier analysis. By inspection:\n- For the $n=1$ term: $C_1 R^2 = V_0 \\implies C_1 = \\frac{V_0}{R^2}$.\n- For all other terms ($n1$): $C_n R^{2n} = 0 \\implies C_n = 0$.\n\nThe infinite series collapses to a single term corresponding to $n=1$. Substituting the value of $C_1$ back into the general solution gives the final potential inside the pipe:\n$$ V(\\rho, \\phi) = \\frac{V_0}{R^2} \\rho^2 \\sin(2\\phi) $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{V_0 \\frac{\\rho^2}{R^2} \\sin(2\\phi)}$$", "id": "1604387"}, {"introduction": "Building on the two-dimensional case, this next problem [@problem_id:1819447] introduces a more complex boundary condition that cannot be satisfied by a single term in the solution series.
