The stability of the solutions to this equation depends on the values of $a$ and $q$. The $(a,q)$-plane is divided into regions of stable (bounded solutions) and unstable (unbounded solutions) behavior.\n\nThe boundaries between these regions correspond to parameter values for which the Mathieu equation admits periodic solutions. These boundary curves are denoted by $a_n(q)$ and $b_n(q)$ for non-negative integers $n$. The curves $a_n(q)$ correspond to even periodic solutions (Mathieu cosine functions $ce_n(t,q)$), while the curves $b_n(q)$ correspond to odd periodic solutions (Mathieu sine functions $se_n(t,q)$).\n\nWe are interested in the stability boundary $b_1(q)$, which corresponds to the Mathieu sine function $se_1(t,q)$. For $q=0$, the equation becomes $y''+ay=0$. The function $se_1(t,0)$ is $\\sin(t)$, which is a solution when $a=1$.
