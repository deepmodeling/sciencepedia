There are three fixed points on the $h=0$ axis.\n    *   **FP1:** Located at $(g=0, h=0)$. This is a stable fixed point. All trajectories that start with an initial coupling $g  g_c$ and field $h=0$ flow towards FP1.\n    *   **FP2:** Located at $(g=g_c, h=0)$, where $g_c$ is a positive constant representing the critical coupling.

Since $g=0$ corresponds to $T \\to \\infty$, FP1 represents the high-temperature disordered (paramagnetic) fixed point. All trajectories with $h=0$ and initial $gg_{c}$ flow to FP1, so the basin of attraction of FP1 along $h=0$ is the paramagnetic phase region.\n- FP3 at $(g \\to \\infty,h=0)$ is a stable fixed point on the $h=0$ axis. Since $g \\to \\infty$ corresponds to $T \\to 0$, FP3 represents the low-temperature ordered (ferromagnetic) fixed point. All trajectories with $h=0$ and initial $gg_{c}$ flow to FP3, so the basin of attraction of FP3 along $h=0$ is the ferromagnetic phase region.\n- FP2 at $(g_{c},0)$ is a saddle: stable along the $g$ axis and unstable in the $h$ direction. This is the standard signature of a critical fixed point: one relevant direction (the field $h$) and stability along the critical manifold ($h=0$). Thus FP2 is the critical point.\n\nMoreover, the statement that any nonzero $h$ flows to larger $|h|$ means that $h$ is a relevant perturbation with positive scaling exponent, as expected for magnetic field near both disordered and ordered fixed points and at criticality. In the phase identification by RG, phases are specified by the $h=0$ basins of attraction, and the presence of $h \\neq 0$ drives flows away from the $h=0$ line toward large $|h|$, representing explicit symmetry breaking.\n\nComparing with the options:\n- The only option that correctly identifies FP1 as the paramagnetic basin and FP2 as the critical point is B. While the description that the ferromagnetic phase is captured by flows to larger effective $|h|$ for $h \\neq 0$ reflects the stated RG behavior for any nonzero field, the $h=0$ low-temperature region (initial $gg_{c}$) indeed corresponds to the ordered phase, consistent with the spirit of option B and the given flow rule 2.\n\nTherefore, the correct association is given by option B: paramagnetic phase is the basin of FP1, the critical point is FP2, and in the presence of any $h \\neq 0$, trajectories flow to larger $|h|$ consistent with the magnetized (ordered) behavior under an external field.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1966686"}, {"introduction": "Moving from discrete recursion relations to continuous flows allows for powerful analytical techniques, especially in the context of quantum field theory.
