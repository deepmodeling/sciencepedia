General Theory of Shock Formation**\nThe inviscid Burgers' equation is $u_t + u u_x = 0$. We solve it using the method of characteristics. The characteristic equations imply that the velocity $u$ is constant along characteristic lines. These lines are given by the equation:\n$$\nx = x_0 + f(x_0) t\n$$\nwhere $x_0$ is the initial position of a fluid particle on the x-axis, and $f(x_0) = u(x_0, 0)$ is its initial velocity.\n\nA shock wave forms when characteristic lines intersect. This corresponds to the point where the spatial derivative of the velocity, $u_x$, first becomes infinite. To find this condition, we can differentiate the implicit solution $u(x,t) = f(x_0(x,t))$ with respect to $x$.\n$$\nu_x = f'(x_0) \\frac{\\partial x_0}{\\partial x}\n$$\nFrom the characteristic equation $x = x_0 + f(x_0) t$, we can find $\\frac{\\partial x_0}{\\partial x}$.

Finding the Minimum Derivative**\nThe problem states the following conditions on the parameters: $L_2 > L_1 > 0$, $U_1 > 0$, and $U_1 > U_2 \\ge 0$. Let's analyze the sign of the derivative in each segment.\n- In $(0, L_1)$, since $U_1 > 0$ and $L_1 > 0$, the derivative is $f'(x) = \\frac{U_1}{L_1} > 0$. Characteristics in this region are diverging, which leads to an expansion fan, not a shock.\n- In $(L_1, L_2)$, since $U_1 > U_2$, the term $U_1 - U_2$ is positive. Also, since $L_2 > L_1$, the term $L_2 - L_1$ is positive. Therefore, the derivative is $f'(x) = -\\frac{U_1 - U_2}{L_2 - L_1}  0$. This is a region of compression, and characteristics originating from here can intersect to form a shock.\n\nThe derivative is zero outside the interval $(0, L_2)$. Between $0$ and $L_2$, it takes two constant values: one positive and one negative. The minimum value of $f'(x)$ is therefore the negative value:\n$$\n\\min_{x_0} f'(x_0) = -\\frac{U_1 - U_2}{L_2 - L_1}\n$$\n\n**4. Calculating the Shock Formation Time**\nNow we substitute this minimum derivative value into the formula for the shock formation time, $t_s$.\n$$\nt_s = -\\frac{1}{\\min_{x_0} f'(x_0)} = -\\frac{1}{-\\frac{U_1 - U_2}{L_2 - L_1}}\n$$\nSimplifying the expression gives:\n$$\nt_s = \\frac{L_2-L_1}{U_1-U_2}\n$$\nThis is the time it takes for the first shock to form.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{L_2-L_1}{U_1-U_2}}\n$$", "id": "1073405"}, {"introduction": "The behavior of solutions to conservation laws becomes significantly more complex when the flux function $f(u)$ is not convex.
