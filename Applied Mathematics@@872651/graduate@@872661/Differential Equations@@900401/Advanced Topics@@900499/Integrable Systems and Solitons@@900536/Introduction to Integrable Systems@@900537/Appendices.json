This exercise demonstrates a fundamental technique for uncovering these hidden invariants by using the trace of the system's monodromy matrix as a generating function. By working through a concrete example from the Ablowitz-Ladik lattice, you will see how these crucial conserved quantities emerge from the underlying algebraic structure established by the Lax pair [@problem_id:1114892].", "problem": "The Ablowitz-Ladik (AL) lattice is a discrete integrable system described by a set of coupled non-linear differential-difference equations for the variables $q_n(t)$ and $r_n(t)$ defined on a one-dimensional lattice indexed by $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. Its integrability is established through the existence of a Lax pair. The spatial part of the Lax pair is given by the matrix $L_n(z)$:\n$$\nL_n(z) = \\begin{pmatrix} z & q_n \\\\ r_n & z^{-1} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nwhere $z$ is a complex spectral parameter. The time evolution is constructed such that the trace of the monodromy matrix is conserved.\n\nFor a finite lattice with $N$ sites under periodic boundary conditions, $q_{n+N} = q_n$ and $r_{n+N} = r_n$, the monodromy matrix is defined as the product $T_N(z) = L_N(z) L_{N-1}(z) \\cdots L_1(z)$.\n\nA crucial difference from many other well-known integrable systems is that $\\det(L_n(z)) = 1 - q_n r_n$, which is not constant. To construct conserved quantities that are extensive (i.e., sums of local densitites), one typically works with a modified monodromy matrix $\\hat{T}_N(z)$ with unit determinant. This is achieved by defining a normalized Lax matrix $\\hat{L}_n(z) = (1 - q_n r_n)^{-1/2} L_n(z)$, so that $\\det(\\hat{L}_n(z))=1$. The corresponding monodromy matrix is $\\hat{T}_N(z) = \\hat{L}_N(z) \\cdots \\hat{L}_1(z)$. The logarithm of its trace, $\\log(\\text{tr}(\\hat{T}_N(z)))$, serves as a generating function for an infinite set of conserved quantities, often called Hamiltonians $H_k$:\n$$\n\\log(\\text{tr}(\\hat{T}_N(z))) = (\\text{const.}) \\log z + \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} H_k z^{-k}\n$$\nThe term proportional to $\\log z$ is considered trivial.
