The local gravitational field is assumed to be perfectly uniform, imparting a constant downward acceleration $g$ to all objects. The clocks fall for a total duration of time $T$, as measured by the stationary surface observer. The duration $T$ is short enough that neither clock reaches the surface during this interval.
