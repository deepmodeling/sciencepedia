The surface is described in Cartesian coordinates $(x, y, z)$ by the equation $\\frac{x^2+y^2}{a^2} + \\frac{z^2}{c^2} = 1$, where $a$ and $c$ are the semi-major and semi-minor axes, respectively, with $a > c > 0$.\n\nA convenient parameterization of the spheroid is given by:\n$$\nx = a \\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi \\\\\ny = a \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi \\\\\nz = c \\cos\\theta\n$$\nHere, $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi]$ is the polar angle measured from the axis of symmetry ($z$-axis), and $\\phi \\in [0, 2\\pi)$ is the azimuthal angle.
