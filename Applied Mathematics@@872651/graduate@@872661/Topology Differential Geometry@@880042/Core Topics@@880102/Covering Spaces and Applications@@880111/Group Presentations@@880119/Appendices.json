A powerful technique in these problems is to use one relation inside another, for example by conjugating one relation by a generator.\n\nLet's take the second relation, $R_2$, which states that $a^2$ is the result of conjugating $a$ by $b^{-1}$. Let's see what happens when we conjugate the element $b^{-1}ab$ by the generator $a$. Specifically, we will compute the expression $a^{-1}(b^{-1}ab)a$.\n\nFirst, we can substitute $b^{-1}ab = a^2$ from $R_2$ into this expression:\n$$a^{-1}(b^{-1}ab)a = a^{-1}(a^2)a = (a^{-1}a)a = ea = a$$\nwhere $e$ is the identity element of the group.\n\nSecond, we can use the associativity of the group operation to re-group the terms in the expression:\n$$a^{-1}(b^{-1}ab)a = (a^{-1}b^{-1}a)(a^{-1}ba)$$\n\nNow we can use the first relation, $R_1: a^{-1}ba = b^2$, to substitute for the second parenthesis:\n$$(a^{-1}b^{-1}a)(a^{-1}ba) = (a^{-1}b^{-1}a)(b^2)$$\n\nSo far, by evaluating the same expression in two different ways, we have derived the equality:\n$$a = (a^{-1}b^{-1}a)b^2$$\n\nTo simplify this further, we need to find an expression for the term $(a^{-1}b^{-1}a)$. Let's look at the first relation $R_1$ again:\n$$a^{-1}ba = b^2$$\nWe can take the inverse of both sides of this equation. The inverse of a product $(xyz)^{-1}$ is $z^{-1}y^{-1}x^{-1}$.\n$$(a^{-1}ba)^{-1} = (b^2)^{-1}$$\n$$(a)^{-1}(b)^{-1}(a^{-1})^{-1} = b^{-2}$$\n$$a^{-1}b^{-1}a = b^{-2}$$\n\nNow we have a simplified expression for the term we needed. Let's substitute $a^{-1}b^{-1}a = b^{-2}$ back into our derived equality $a = (a^{-1}b^{-1}a)b^2$:\n$$a = (b^{-2})b^2$$\n$$a = b^{-2}b^2 = e$$\n\nSo, we have shown that the generator $a$ must be the identity element, $a=e$.\n\nNow we can substitute $a=e$ back into one of the original relations to find the nature of the generator $b$. Let's use the second relation, $R_2$:\n$$b^{-1}ab = a^2$$\nSubstituting $a=e$:\n$$b^{-1}(e)b = (e)^2$$\n$$b^{-1}b = e$$\n$$e = e$$\nThis particular substitution gives no new information about $b$. Let's use the first relation, $R_1$:\n$$a^{-1}ba = b^2$$\nSubstituting $a=e$:\n$$e^{-1}be = b^2$$\n$$ebe = b^2$$\n$$b = b^2$$\n\nFrom $b=b^2$, we can multiply on the left by $b^{-1}$ (which must exist as $b$ is an element of a group):\n$$b^{-1}b = b^{-1}b^2$$\n$$e = b$$\n\nSo, we have shown that both generators, $a$ and $b$, must be the identity element $e$.

So, $z = x^2 = y^2$.\n    *   Next, we show that $z^2=e$ (i.e., $x^4=y^4=e$).\n        From the relation $xyx=y$, we can right-multiply by $x^{-1}$ to get $xy = yx^{-1}$.\n        Now consider the term $x^2y$:\n        $$ x^2y = x(xy) = x(yx^{-1}) = (xy)x^{-1} = (yx^{-1})x^{-1} = yx^{-2} $$\n        So we have the relation $x^2y = yx^{-2}$. Since $z=x^2$, this is $zy=yz^{-1}$.\n        However, from the start we found $x^2 = y^2$. Let's substitute $x^2$ for $y^2$ in the expression $y^2x = x^3$:\n        $$ y^2x = y(yx) = y(xy^{-1}) = (yx)y^{-1} = (xy^{-1})y^{-1} = xy^{-2} $$\n        So we have $y^2x = xy^{-2}$. Substituting $y^2=x^2$ gives $x^2x = x^3 = xy^{-2}$, which implies $x^2 = y^{-2}$.\n        Combining our two findings, $x^2=y^2$ and $x^2=y^{-2}$, we must have $y^2=y^{-2}$, which means $y^4=e$. Since $x^2=y^2$, it follows that $x^4=e$ as well. Thus, our element $z=x^2=y^2$ satisfies $z^2=e$.\n    *   Now we show that $z$ is a central element.\n        We had the relation $x^2y = yx^{-2}$. Since $x^4=e$, we know $x^{-2}=x^2$. So, the relation becomes $x^2y = yx^2$. This means $z$ commutes with $y$.\n        Since $z=x^2$ is a power of $x$, it automatically commutes with $x$.\n        Because $z$ commutes with both generators, it is central.\n    *   Finally, we establish a normal form for elements of $G$.\n        Any element of $G$ is a word in $x$ and $y$. Using the relations $x^2=z$, $y^2=z$, $z^2=e$, we can reduce any word so that powers of $x$ and $y$ are at most 1. To order the generators, we use the relation $yx = xy^{-1}$. We can simplify $y^{-1}$ as follows: $y^{-1} = y^3 = y^2y = zy$. So, $yx = x(zy) = z(xy)$ since $z$ is central.\n        Using these rules ($x^2=z, y^2=z, z^2=e$, $z$ is central, $yx=zxy$), any word can be uniquely written in the form $x^a y^b z^c$ where $a, b, c \\in \\{0,1\\}$.

We must check if the relations of $G$ are satisfied by their images in $Q_8$.\n    *   Relation 1: $xyx = y$. Let's check if $iji = j$.\n        In $Q_8$, $ij=k$ and $ji=-k$. So, $iji = i(ji) = i(-k) = -ik$. Also, $ik=j$ is incorrect, $ik=-j$ is also incorrect. Let's use `ijk=-1`. `ij=k`. `ji=-k`. `jk=i`. `kj=-i`. `ki=j`. `ik=-j`.\n        So $iji = i(ji) = i(-k) = -ik = -(-j) = j$. The relation holds.\n    *   Relation 2: $yxy = x$. Let's check if $jij = i$.\n        $jij = j(ij) = j(k) = i$. The relation holds.\n    Since the defining relations of $G$ hold for the images of the generators in $Q_8$, $\\phi$ is a well-defined group homomorphism. The image of $\\phi$ contains $\\phi(x)=i$ and $\\phi(y)=j$. Since $i$ and $j$ generate the entire quaternion group $Q_8$, the homomorphism is surjective.\n    This implies that $|G| \\ge |Q_8| = 8$.\n\n3.  **Conclusion.**\n    Combining the two bounds, $|G| \\le 8$ and $|G| \\ge 8$, we conclude that $|G| = 8$. The group $G$ is isomorphic to the quaternion group $Q_8$.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1800184"}]}
