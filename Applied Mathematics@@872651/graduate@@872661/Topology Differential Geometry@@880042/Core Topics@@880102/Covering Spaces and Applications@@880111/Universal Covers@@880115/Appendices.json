The fundamental group of this space is the free group on two generators, $\\pi_1(X) = F_2 = \\langle a, b \\rangle$, where $a$ and $b$ are the homotopy classes of loops traversing $S^1_a$ and $S^1_b$ respectively.\n\nThe universal cover of $X$, denoted by $\\tilde{X}$, is an infinite 4-valent tree. We can endow $\\tilde{X}$ with a metric by assigning lengths to its edges.

A word is cyclically reduced if it is reduced (contains no pairs like $xx^{-1}$) and its first and last letters are not inverses of each other.\n\nOur task is to find the cyclically reduced word conjugate to $g = ab^2ab^{-1}a^{-1}$ and then compute its length.\n\n**Step 2: Perform cyclic reduction on the given word**\nThe given word is $w = ab^2ab^{-1}a^{-1}$. This word is already reduced. However, its first letter ($a$) is the inverse of its last letter ($a^{-1}$), so it is not cyclically reduced.\n\nTo find the cyclically reduced representative, we perform a conjugation. Since $w$ has the form $a \\cdot (b^2ab^{-1}) \\cdot a^{-1}$, it is conjugate to the word inside the parentheses:\n$$ g \\sim b^2ab^{-1} $$\nNow we examine the new word $v = b^2ab^{-1}$.
