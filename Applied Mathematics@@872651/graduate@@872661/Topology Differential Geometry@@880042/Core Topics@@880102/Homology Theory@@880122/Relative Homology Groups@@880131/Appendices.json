They are defined within the framework of a long exact sequence that connects the homology of $X$, $A$, and the pair $(X, A)$.\n\nConsider the topological space known as the **dunce hat**, denoted by $D$. It can be constructed as a CW-complex with a single 0-cell (vertex) $v$, a single 1-cell (edge) $a$, and a single 2-cell (face) $f$. The 1-cell $a$ is attached to the 0-cell $v$ at both ends, forming a loop, so the 1-skeleton is a circle. The 2-cell $f$ is attached to this circle via an attaching map that follows the path described by the word $a a a^{-1}$. This means the boundary of the 2-cell is traced by traversing the edge $a$ twice in the positive direction, and then once in the negative direction.\n\nThe boundary of the dunce hat, $\\partial D$, is the subspace corresponding to the identified edges of its construction from a triangle. In the CW-complex structure, this corresponds to the 1-skeleton, which is a circle ($S^1$).\n\nYour task is to determine the rank of the second relative homology group $H_2(D, \\partial D)$.

Thus, their homology groups are isomorphic: $H_n(A) \\cong H_n(S^1)$. We substitute the given homology groups into the sequence:\n    -   $H_2(S^2) = \\mathbb{Z}$\n    -   $H_1(S^2) = 0$\n    -   $H_2(A) \\cong H_2(S^1) = 0$\n    -   $H_1(A) \\cong H_1(S^1) = \\mathbb{Z}$\n\n    The sequence becomes:\n    $$ \\dots \\to 0 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{j_*} H_2(S^2, A) \\xrightarrow{\\partial_*} \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{i_*} 0 \\to \\dots $$\n\n3.  **Analyzing the Sequence and Maps:**\n    This segment of the long exact sequence starting from a zero group and ending in a zero group forms a short exact sequence:\n    $$ 0 \\to H_2(S^2) \\xrightarrow{j_*} H_2(S^2, A) \\xrightarrow{\\partial_*} H_1(A) \\to 0 $$\n    Let's verify this by examining the properties that exactness imposes.\n    -   Exactness at $H_2(S^2) = \\mathbb{Z}$: The kernel of $j_*$ is the image of the preceding map, which comes from $H_2(A) = 0$. So, $\\ker(j_*) = 0$, which means $j_*$ is injective.\n    -   Exactness at $H_1(A) = \\mathbb{Z}$: The image of $\\partial_*$ is the kernel of the subsequent map, $i_*: H_1(A) \\to H_1(S^2)$. Since the target space $H_1(S^2)$ is the trivial group $0$, the map $i_*$ must be the zero map. The kernel of the zero map is its entire domain, so $\\ker(i_*) = H_1(A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. Therefore, $\\text{im}(\\partial_*) = H_1(A)$, which means $\\partial_*$ is surjective.\n\n    We have confirmed that the sequence is indeed the short exact sequence:\n    $$ 0 \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to H_2(S^2, A) \\to \\mathbb{Z} \\to 0 $$\n\n4.  **The Splitting Lemma:**\n    For a short exact sequence of abelian groups of the form $0 \\to K \\to G \\to Q \\to 0$, the sequence splits if $Q$ is a free abelian group. This means that $G$ is isomorphic to the direct sum of $K$ and $Q$, i.e., $G \\cong K \\oplus Q$.\n    In our case, $K = H_2(S^2) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ and $Q = H_1(A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$. The group $\\mathbb{Z}$ is a free abelian group (with basis $\\{1\\}$). Therefore, the sequence splits.\n\n5.  **Determining the Group Structure:**\n    The splitting lemma implies that $H_2(S^2, A)$ is isomorphic to the direct sum of the groups at its ends in the short exact sequence:\n    $$ H_2(S^2, A) \\cong H_2(S^2) \\oplus H_1(A) $$\n    Substituting the known groups, we get:\n    $$ H_2(S^2, A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} $$\n\n6.  **Calculating the Betti Number:**\n    The problem asks for the second relative Betti number, $b_2(S^2, A)$, which is defined as the rank of the free abelian part of $H_2(S^2, A)$.\n    The group $H_2(S^2, A) \\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$ is a free abelian group. The rank of a free abelian group $\\mathbb{Z}^k$ is $k$.\n    In our case, the rank of $\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}$ is $2$.\n    Thus, the second relative Betti number is:\n    $$ b_2(S^2, A) = \\text{rank}(\\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}) = 2 $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "1016330"}, {"introduction": "Our final practice demonstrates how relative homology is used in concert with other powerful techniques in algebraic topology to analyze more complex spaces.
