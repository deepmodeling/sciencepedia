The calculation of its integral homology groups can be performed using cellular homology by defining a suitable CW complex structure on $X$.\n\nLet's define a CW structure on $X$ as follows:\n- The 0-skeleton, $X^0$, consists of a single 0-cell, denoted by $p$.\n- The 1-skeleton, $X^1$, is formed by attaching two 1-cells, denoted $a$ and $b$, to $X^0$. The attaching map for each 1-cell maps both of its boundary points to the single 0-cell $p$.\n- The 2-skeleton, $X$, is formed by attaching two 2-cells, denoted $U$ and $L$, to $X^1$. The attaching map for both $U$ and $L$ is a map from the boundary circle $S^1$ to the 1-skeleton $X^1 = S^1_a \\vee S^1_b$, defined by traversing the loop $a$ in the positive direction and then the loop $b$ in the negative direction.\n\nFor a CW complex $X$, the cellular chain complex $(C_*(X), d_*)$ is defined as follows.
