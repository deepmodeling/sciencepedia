## Introduction
Hypersurfaces, or submanifolds of codimension one, are among the most fundamental and ubiquitous objects in differential geometry. They appear everywhere, from the boundaries of shapes in Euclidean space to the "instant-in-time" slices of spacetime in general relativity. A central challenge in their study is to develop a precise mathematical language to describe how a hypersurface curves and sits within its [ambient space](@entry_id:184743), and to understand the deep relationship between its own [intrinsic geometry](@entry_id:158788) and the [extrinsic geometry](@entry_id:262461) imposed by its embedding. This article provides a comprehensive introduction to this rich theory.

The journey begins in the **Principles and Mechanisms** chapter, where we will construct the essential tools for this analysis: the second fundamental form and the shape operator. We will use them to define various notions of curvature and derive the celebrated Gauss and Codazzi equations that govern the interplay between intrinsic and extrinsic properties. We will also explore the variational theory of hypersurfaces, leading to the study of minimal and [constant mean curvature](@entry_id:194008) surfaces. Following this, the **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections** chapter will demonstrate the remarkable utility of these concepts. We will see how hypersurface theory provides a crucial framework for solving problems in [geometric analysis](@entry_id:157700), understanding the dynamics of [geometric flows](@entry_id:198994), modeling spacetime in general relativity, and constructing the Calabi-Yau manifolds central to string theory. Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** section will offer opportunities to apply these theoretical concepts to concrete problems, solidifying your understanding by calculating curvatures and analyzing the properties of specific hypersurfaces. Through this structured approach, you will gain a robust understanding of both the foundational principles of [hypersurface geometry](@entry_id:191223) and its profound impact across science and mathematics.

## Principles and Mechanisms

This chapter delves into the fundamental principles that govern the geometry of hypersurfaces. We will develop the essential tools for describing how a hypersurface sits within an [ambient space](@entry_id:184743), leading to the concepts of the second fundamental form and the [shape operator](@entry_id:264703). These tools will allow us to define and analyze various notions of curvature. We will then explore the deep connections between the hypersurface's own intrinsic geometry and the [extrinsic geometry](@entry_id:262461) imposed by its embedding, as captured by the celebrated equations of Gauss and Codazzi. Finally, we will transition to a variational perspective, investigating hypersurfaces as [critical points](@entry_id:144653) of the [area functional](@entry_id:635965), which gives rise to the theories of minimal and [constant mean curvature](@entry_id:194008) surfaces and the crucial concept of stability.

### The Second Fundamental Form and the Shape Operator

Let $\Sigma^n$ be a hypersurface immersed in an $(n+1)$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $(M^{n+1}, g)$. The metric $g$ of the ambient manifold $M$ induces a Riemannian metric on $\Sigma$, which we call the **[first fundamental form](@entry_id:274022)**. To understand the [extrinsic geometry](@entry_id:262461) of $\Sigma$—that is, how it bends within $M$—we must analyze how [vector fields](@entry_id:161384) tangent to $\Sigma$ change as we differentiate them in the [ambient space](@entry_id:184743).

Let $X$ and $Y$ be [vector fields](@entry_id:161384) tangent to $\Sigma$, and let $\nabla$ be the Levi-Civita connection on $M$. The [covariant derivative](@entry_id:152476) $\nabla_X Y$ is a vector field in $M$, but it is not, in general, tangent to $\Sigma$. We can decompose it into its tangential and normal components:
$$ \nabla_X Y = (\nabla_X Y)^T + (\nabla_X Y)^\perp $$
The tangential component, $(\nabla_X Y)^T$, defines a connection on $\Sigma$, which can be shown to be the Levi-Civita connection of the [induced metric](@entry_id:160616). The normal component, $(\nabla_X Y)^\perp$, is of central importance as it measures the failure of the [tangent space](@entry_id:141028) to be parallel along $\Sigma$. This normal component is defined as the **second fundamental form**, denoted $\mathrm{II}(X,Y)$:
$$ \mathrm{II}(X,Y) = (\nabla_X Y)^\perp $$
The second fundamental form is a symmetric [bilinear map](@entry_id:150924) that takes two [tangent vectors](@entry_id:265494) and returns a [normal vector](@entry_id:264185). Its symmetry is a direct consequence of the torsion-free property of the ambient connection $\nabla$. Specifically, since $\nabla$ is torsion-free, we have $\nabla_X Y - \nabla_Y X = [X,Y]$. Because the Lie bracket $[X,Y]$ of two vector fields tangent to a submanifold is also tangent to it, the normal component of the Lie bracket is zero. This leads to:
$$ \mathrm{II}(X,Y) - \mathrm{II}(Y,X) = (\nabla_X Y)^\perp - (\nabla_Y X)^\perp = (\nabla_X Y - \nabla_Y X)^\perp = ([X,Y])^\perp = 0 $$
Thus, $\mathrm{II}(X,Y) = \mathrm{II}(Y,X)$, establishing the symmetry of the second fundamental form [@problem_id:2984398].

Since $\Sigma$ is a hypersurface, the normal space at each point is one-dimensional. Assuming $\Sigma$ is two-sided, we can choose a smooth unit [normal vector field](@entry_id:268853) $\nu$ along $\Sigma$. The second fundamental form can then be expressed as a scalar-valued bilinear form, often denoted $h$, by taking the inner product with $\nu$:
$$ h(X,Y) = g(\mathrm{II}(X,Y), \nu) = g(\nabla_X Y, \nu) $$
This scalar form $h$ is intimately related to another fundamental object, the **[shape operator](@entry_id:264703)** (or **Weingarten map**). For a chosen unit normal $\nu$, the shape operator $A: T\Sigma \to T\Sigma$ is the unique endomorphism of the [tangent bundle](@entry_id:161294) of $\Sigma$ defined by the relation:
$$ g(AX, Y) = h(X,Y) $$
for all [tangent vectors](@entry_id:265494) $X, Y$. The shape operator measures the change of the [normal vector field](@entry_id:268853) as one moves in a tangential direction. This is made precise by the **Weingarten equation**, which we derive by differentiating the identity $g(Y, \nu) = 0$ along a [tangent vector](@entry_id:264836) field $X$:
$$ 0 = X(g(Y, \nu)) = g(\nabla_X Y, \nu) + g(Y, \nabla_X \nu) = g(AX, Y) + g(Y, \nabla_X \nu) $$
This gives $g(AX, Y) = -g(Y, \nabla_X \nu)$. Since $\nabla_X \nu$ is tangent to $\Sigma$ (which follows from differentiating $g(\nu, \nu) = 1$), we obtain the celebrated Weingarten equation:
$$ AX = -\nabla_X \nu $$
From its definition, the shape operator inherits a crucial symmetry property from the [second fundamental form](@entry_id:161454). For any [tangent vectors](@entry_id:265494) $X, Y$:
$$ g(AX, Y) = h(X,Y) = h(Y,X) = g(AY, X) = g(X, AY) $$
This shows that the shape operator $A$ is a **self-adjoint** (or symmetric) [linear operator](@entry_id:136520) on each [tangent space](@entry_id:141028) $T_p\Sigma$ with respect to the [induced metric](@entry_id:160616) [@problem_id:2984398].

The self-adjointness of the [shape operator](@entry_id:264703) guarantees, by the [spectral theorem](@entry_id:136620), that at each point $p \in \Sigma$, there exists an orthonormal basis of $T_p\Sigma$ consisting of eigenvectors of $A$. These eigenvectors are called the **[principal directions](@entry_id:276187)**, and the corresponding real eigenvalues, $\lambda_1, \dots, \lambda_n$, are the **[principal curvatures](@entry_id:270598)** of $\Sigma$ at $p$. These values quantify the bending of the hypersurface in specific directions.

To make these concepts concrete, consider a surface in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^3$ given as the [graph of a function](@entry_id:159270) $z = f(x, y)$. A [parameterization](@entry_id:265163) is $\mathbf{x}(x, y) = (x, y, f(x, y))$. The [tangent vectors](@entry_id:265494) are $\mathbf{x}_x = (1, 0, f_x)$ and $\mathbf{x}_y = (0, 1, f_y)$, where subscripts denote [partial derivatives](@entry_id:146280). The upward-pointing [unit normal vector](@entry_id:178851) is $\nu = \frac{(-f_x, -f_y, 1)}{\sqrt{1 + f_x^2 + f_y^2}}$. The components of the scalar second fundamental form $h_{ij}$ in this coordinate system are given by $h_{ij} = \nu \cdot \mathbf{x}_{ij}$, where $\mathbf{x}_{ij} = \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{x}}{\partial x^i \partial x^j}$. For instance, the mixed component $h_{12} = h_{xy}$ is:
$$ h_{12} = \nu \cdot \frac{\partial^2 \mathbf{x}}{\partial x \partial y} = \frac{(-f_x, -f_y, 1)}{\sqrt{1 + f_x^2 + f_y^2}} \cdot (0, 0, f_{xy}) = \frac{f_{xy}}{\sqrt{1+f_x^2+f_y^2}} $$
As an example, for the surface defined by $f(x, y) = A \cos(kx) \sin(ky) - Bxy$, we find the [partial derivatives](@entry_id:146280) at the origin $(0,0)$ to be $f_x(0,0) = 0$, $f_y(0,0) = Ak$, and $f_{xy}(0,0) = -B$. The component $h_{12}$ at the origin is therefore $-\frac{B}{\sqrt{1+A^2k^2}}$ [@problem_id:971956].

### Intrinsic and Extrinsic Curvature

From the [principal curvatures](@entry_id:270598), we can define several important [geometric invariants](@entry_id:178611). For a hypersurface $\Sigma^n$, the **[mean curvature](@entry_id:162147)** $H$ is the normalized sum of the [principal curvatures](@entry_id:270598):
$$ H = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \lambda_i = \frac{1}{n} \mathrm{tr}(A) $$
Note that some authors define the mean curvature without the factor of $1/n$. We will use $H$ for the normalized version and often refer to $\mathrm{tr}(A)$ as the scalar [mean curvature](@entry_id:162147). Using the Weingarten equation, we can express the scalar [mean curvature](@entry_id:162147) directly in terms of the [normal vector field](@entry_id:268853). For an orthonormal basis $\{e_i\}$ of $T_p\Sigma$:
$$ \mathrm{tr}(A) = \sum_{i=1}^n g(Ae_i, e_i) = \sum_{i=1}^n g(-\nabla_{e_i} \nu, e_i) = - \sum_{i=1}^n g(\nabla_{e_i} \nu, e_i) $$
This expression can be interpreted as the negative of the "intrinsic divergence" of the normal field's projection onto the [tangent bundle](@entry_id:161294), and it highlights how [mean curvature](@entry_id:162147) measures the infinitesimal change in volume under a normal deformation. A classic application is the calculation of the mean curvature of a sphere $S^m(R)$ of radius $R$ in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{m+1}$. Taking the [outward-pointing normal](@entry_id:753030) $\nu(p) = p/R$, its ambient derivative in a tangent direction $X_p$ is $\nabla_{X_p} \nu = X_p/R$. The scalar [mean curvature](@entry_id:162147) is then
$$ \mathrm{tr}(A) = -\sum_{i=1}^n g\left(\frac{1}{R}e_i, e_i\right) = -\frac{1}{R}\sum_{i=1}^n g(e_i,e_i) = -\frac{m}{R} $$
The sign indicates that the sphere curves "away" from its outward normal [@problem_id:2984389].

For a two-dimensional surface ($n=2$), another crucial invariant is the **Gaussian curvature** $K$, defined as the product of the principal curvatures:
$$ K = \lambda_1 \lambda_2 = \det(A) $$
For a surface given as a graph $z=f(x,y)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$, the Gaussian curvature has the explicit formula:
$$ K = \frac{f_{xx}f_{yy} - f_{xy}^2}{(1 + f_x^2 + f_y^2)^2} $$
For instance, for the surface $f(x, y) = C \cos(kx) \cosh(ky)$, at the point $(\pi/k, 0)$, the partial derivatives are $f_x=f_y=f_{xy}=0$, $f_{xx}=Ck^2$, and $f_{yy}=-Ck^2$. The Gaussian curvature at this point is $K = \frac{(Ck^2)(-Ck^2) - 0}{(1+0+0)^2} = -C^2k^4$, indicating a saddle-like geometry [@problem_id:971815].

### The Fundamental Equations of Gauss and Codazzi

The preceding definitions of curvature are extrinsic, relying on the embedding in an ambient space. A profound discovery by Gauss, the **Theorema Egregium** (Remarkable Theorem), revealed that the Gaussian curvature is, in fact, an intrinsic property of the surface, depending only on the first fundamental form. This means it can be calculated by a surveyor living within the surface who has no knowledge of the [ambient space](@entry_id:184743). This theorem is a special case of a more general set of [structural equations](@entry_id:274644) that link the geometry of the hypersurface to that of the ambient manifold.

Let $R$ be the intrinsic Riemann [curvature tensor](@entry_id:181383) of $\Sigma$ and $\bar{R}$ be the Riemann [curvature tensor](@entry_id:181383) of the ambient manifold $M$. The **Gauss equation** relates these two tensors via the [second fundamental form](@entry_id:161454):
$$ g(R(X,Y)Z, W) = g(\bar{R}(X,Y)Z, W) + h(X,Z)h(Y,W) - h(X,W)h(Y,Z) $$
For a surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$, where the ambient curvature $\bar{R}$ is zero, this equation simplifies and leads to the intrinsic formula for Gaussian curvature. The [helicoid](@entry_id:264087), parametrized by $\mathbf{r}(u, v) = (u \cos v, u \sin v, b v)$, provides a beautiful illustration. A direct calculation using the coefficients of the [first and second fundamental forms](@entry_id:192112) gives the [extrinsic curvature](@entry_id:160405) $K_{\text{ext}} = \frac{LN - M^2}{EG - F^2} = -\frac{b^2}{(u^2+b^2)^2}$. An independent calculation using Brioschi's formula, which depends only on the first fundamental form ($E=1, F=0, G=u^2+b^2$) and its derivatives, yields the exact same result, thereby verifying the Theorema Egregium in this case [@problem_id:971805].

The Gauss equation allows us to compute the [intrinsic curvature](@entry_id:161701) of a hypersurface if we know its [extrinsic curvature](@entry_id:160405) and the ambient curvature. For example, consider a geodesic sphere of radius $r$ in $(n+1)$-dimensional [hyperbolic space](@entry_id:268092) $\mathbb{H}^{n+1}$, which has [constant sectional curvature](@entry_id:272200) $c=-1$. The principal curvatures of this sphere are all equal to $\coth(r)$. By contracting the Gauss equation, we can derive a formula for the intrinsic scalar curvature $R$ of the hypersurface:
$$ R = \bar{R}_{\Sigma} + (\mathrm{tr}A)^2 - |A|^2 $$
where $\bar{R}_{\Sigma}$ is the [scalar curvature](@entry_id:157547) of the ambient manifold restricted to tangent planes of $\Sigma$, and $|A|^2 = \sum \lambda_i^2$ is the squared norm of the [shape operator](@entry_id:264703). For $\mathbb{H}^{n+1}$, $\bar{R}_{\Sigma} = n(n-1)c = -n(n-1)$. Since all $\lambda_i=\coth(r)$, we have $(\mathrm{tr}A)^2 = (n\coth r)^2$ and $|A|^2 = n\coth^2 r$. This leads to the [scalar curvature](@entry_id:157547) of the sphere:
$$ R = -n(n-1) + n^2\coth^2 r - n\coth^2 r = -n(n-1) + n(n-1)\coth^2 r = n(n-1)(\coth^2 r - 1) = \frac{n(n-1)}{\sinh^2 r} $$
This result shows how the sphere's intrinsic curvature depends on both its dimension $n$ and its radius $r$ within the hyperbolic space [@problem_id:971946].

Complementing the Gauss equation is the **Codazzi-Mainardi equation**, which provides a compatibility condition between the [first and second fundamental forms](@entry_id:192112). It relates the [covariant derivative](@entry_id:152476) of the [shape operator](@entry_id:264703) (or [second fundamental form](@entry_id:161454)) to the ambient curvature:
$$ (\nabla_X A)Y - (\nabla_Y A)X = -(\bar{R}(X,Y)\nu)^T $$
In a flat [ambient space](@entry_id:184743) like $\mathbb{R}^3$, the right-hand side vanishes, implying that the [covariant derivative](@entry_id:152476) of the [shape operator](@entry_id:264703), $(\nabla A)$, is a [symmetric tensor](@entry_id:144567). This condition constrains how the extrinsic curvature can vary across the surface. Explicitly calculating components of $(\nabla A)$ involves Christoffel symbols of the surface and derivatives of the [second fundamental form](@entry_id:161454) components, as illustrated in the computation of $(\nabla_1 S)_{12}$ for the [helicoid](@entry_id:264087) [@problem_id:971821].

### Variational Principles and Stability

The study of hypersurfaces takes a dynamic turn when we consider them from the perspective of the [calculus of variations](@entry_id:142234). A central object of study is the **[area functional](@entry_id:635965)**, $\mathcal{A}(\Sigma)$, which measures the $n$-dimensional volume of the hypersurface.

The [first variation of area](@entry_id:195526) under a normal variation $V=f\nu$ (where $f$ is a smooth function on $\Sigma$ indicating the speed of deformation) is given by:
$$ \delta\mathcal{A}(V) = -\int_\Sigma f \, \mathrm{tr}(A) \, d\mu $$
Hypersurfaces that are critical points of the [area functional](@entry_id:635965), meaning $\delta\mathcal{A}(V)=0$ for all admissible variations, are characterized by the Euler-Lagrange equation $\mathrm{tr}(A) = 0$. Such hypersurfaces are called **[minimal hypersurfaces](@entry_id:188002)**. A key point is that being minimal ($\mathrm{tr}(A)=0$) is a weaker condition than being **[totally geodesic](@entry_id:183906)** ($A=0$). A [totally geodesic](@entry_id:183906) hypersurface is flat in an extrinsic sense (its acceleration vectors are purely tangential), and is therefore minimal. However, many [minimal hypersurfaces](@entry_id:188002), like the [helicoid](@entry_id:264087) or the catenoid in $\mathbb{R}^3$, are highly curved ($A \neq 0$) but have their principal curvatures balancing out to yield zero mean curvature [@problem_id:2984408].

A related class of hypersurfaces arises when we seek [critical points](@entry_id:144653) of the [area functional](@entry_id:635965) subject to a constraint, such as preserving the enclosed volume. This constrained variational problem leads to the Euler-Lagrange equation $\mathrm{tr}(A) = \text{constant}$. These are the **[constant mean curvature](@entry_id:194008) (CMC) hypersurfaces**, which include minimal surfaces (the case of zero constant) and spheres in Euclidean space (the case of non-zero constant) [@problem_id:2984408].

Once a critical point is found, the next natural question is its stability. A [minimal hypersurface](@entry_id:196896) is **stable** if it is a local minimum of the [area functional](@entry_id:635965), which means any small perturbation must increase its area, at least to second order. This is determined by the sign of the [second variation of area](@entry_id:187529). For a [minimal hypersurface](@entry_id:196896) ($\mathrm{tr}(A)=0$) under a normal variation $V=f\nu$, the [second variation formula](@entry_id:180586) is:
$$ \delta^2\mathcal{A}(V,V) = \int_\Sigma \left( |\nabla f|^2 - (|A|^2 + \mathrm{Ric}_M(\nu,\nu))f^2 \right) d\mu $$
where $|\nabla f|^2$ is the squared norm of the intrinsic gradient of $f$, $|A|^2$ is the squared norm of the [shape operator](@entry_id:264703), and $\mathrm{Ric}_M(\nu,\nu)$ is the Ricci curvature of the ambient manifold in the normal direction [@problem_id:3036672].

Stability requires this quantity to be non-negative for all smooth functions $f$. This condition can be elegantly rephrased in spectral terms. By integrating the $|\nabla f|^2$ term by parts, the second variation can be written as an inner product with a [differential operator](@entry_id:202628):
$$ \delta^2\mathcal{A}(f,f) = \int_\Sigma f \mathcal{L}f \, d\mu = \langle \mathcal{L}f, f \rangle_{L^2} $$
where $\mathcal{L}$ is the **[stability operator](@entry_id:191401)** (or **Jacobi operator**), a self-adjoint Schrödinger-type operator given by:
$$ \mathcal{L} = -\Delta_\Sigma - (|A|^2 + \mathrm{Ric}_M(\nu,\nu)) $$
Here, $\Delta_\Sigma$ is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $\Sigma$. The stability of the [minimal hypersurface](@entry_id:196896) is thus equivalent to the operator $\mathcal{L}$ being non-negative. By the spectral theory of [self-adjoint operators](@entry_id:152188) on compact manifolds, this is equivalent to its lowest eigenvalue, $\lambda_1(\mathcal{L})$, being non-negative: $\lambda_1(\mathcal{L}) \ge 0$ [@problem_id:3036672] [@problem_id:3036676].

If $\lambda_1(\mathcal{L})  0$, the hypersurface is **unstable**. The number of negative eigenvalues of $\mathcal{L}$, counted with [multiplicity](@entry_id:136466), is called the **Morse index** of the [minimal hypersurface](@entry_id:196896). The Morse index has a clear geometric meaning: it is the maximal dimension of a space of normal variations along which the area of $\Sigma$ decreases to second order. Each eigenfunction corresponding to a negative eigenvalue represents a direction of instability [@problem_id:3036676]. Eigenfunctions for the eigenvalue zero are called **Jacobi fields**; they generate variations that leave the area unchanged to second order and correspond to directions of neutral stability. A [totally geodesic submanifold](@entry_id:191437), despite being a critical point, is not necessarily stable. For example, a great circle on a sphere is [totally geodesic](@entry_id:183906) and minimal, but it is unstable—it can be deformed into a smaller latitude circle, decreasing its length [@problem_id:2984408].

This variational framework, connecting differential geometry, partial differential equations, and [spectral theory](@entry_id:275351), provides powerful tools for understanding the existence, classification, and behavior of hypersurfaces.
