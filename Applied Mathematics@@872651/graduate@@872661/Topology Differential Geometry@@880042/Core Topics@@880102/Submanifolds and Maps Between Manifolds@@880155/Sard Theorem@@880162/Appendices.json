The codomain $\\mathbb{R}^2$ has dimension 2. The map $df_p$ fails to be surjective if the dimension of its image is less than 2 (i.e., 0 or 1). This occurs if and only if the kernel of $df_p$ is non-trivial. The kernel of $df_p$ consists of vectors $v \\in T_pM$ such that $df_p(v) = (0,0)$.\nFrom the expression for $df_p$, this means we are looking for vectors $v \\in T_pM$ such that $(v_x, v_y) = (0,0)$. So, $v$ must be of the form $(0, 0, v_z)$ for some $v_z \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nFor $p$ to be a critical point, there must exist a non-zero vector $v=(0,0,v_z)$ with $v_z \\neq 0$ that lies in the tangent space $T_pM$.\nSubstituting $v=(0,0,v_z)$ into the equation for the tangent space:\n$$\n\\frac{x}{a^2}(0) + \\frac{y}{b^2}(0) + \\frac{z}{c^2}v_z = 0\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{z}{c^2}v_z = 0\n$$\nSince we require $v_z \\neq 0$ for a non-trivial kernel, and $c$ is a positive constant, this condition can only be satisfied if $z=0$.\nThe critical points are therefore the points $(x,y,z)$ on the ellipsoid for which $z=0$. These points must satisfy the ellipsoid equation:\n$$\n\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} + \\frac{0^2}{c^2} = 1 \\implies \\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\n$$\nSo, the set of critical points is the ellipse in the $xy$-plane defined by this equation.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the set of critical values**\n\nThe set of critical values is the image of the set of critical points under the map $f$. Let a critical point be $p_c = (x,y,0)$ where $\\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$.\nThe image of this point is:\n$$\nf(p_c) = f(x,y,0) = (x,y)\n$$\nLet the coordinates in the target space $\\mathbb{R}^2$ be $(u,v)$. Then a point $(u,v)$ is a critical value if $u=x$ and $v=y$ for some critical point $(x,y,0)$. Therefore, the set of critical values is the set of points $(u,v) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$ that satisfy:\n$$\n\\frac{u^2}{a^2} + \\frac{v^2}{b^2} = 1\n$$\nThis is an ellipse in the target plane with semi-axes $a$ and $b$.\n\n**Step 5: Calculate the area of the convex hull of the critical values**\n\nThe set of critical values is the ellipse $\\frac{u^2}{a^2} + \\frac{v^2}{b^2} = 1$. The convex hull of an ellipse is the region bounded by the ellipse, i.e., the set of points $(u,v)$ such that $\\frac{u^2}{a^2} + \\frac{v^2}{b^2} \\le 1$.\nThe area of this region, let's call it $A$, can be calculated by a double integral:\n$$\nA = \\iint_{\\frac{u^2}{a^2} + \\frac{v^2}{b^2} \\le 1} du \\, dv\n$$\nTo evaluate this integral, we use a change of coordinates, which is a generalization of polar coordinates:\n$$\nu = a r \\cos\\theta, \\quad v = b r \\sin\\theta\n$$\nwhere $r \\in [0,1]$ and $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi]$.
