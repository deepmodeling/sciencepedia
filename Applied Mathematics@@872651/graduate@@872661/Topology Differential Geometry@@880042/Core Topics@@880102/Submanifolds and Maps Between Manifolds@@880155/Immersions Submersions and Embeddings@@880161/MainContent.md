## Introduction
In the study of [differential geometry](@entry_id:145818), understanding the relationships between [smooth manifolds](@entry_id:160799) is paramount. Smooth maps provide the language for describing these relationships, but their behavior can be complex, involving stretching, folding, or projecting one space onto another. A fundamental challenge is to classify the geometric nature of these transformations in a precise and useful way. This is the gap filled by the core concepts of immersions, [submersions](@entry_id:159709), and embeddings, which use the [local linear approximation](@entry_id:263289) of a map—its differential—to reveal profound global and local structural information.

This article provides a comprehensive exploration of these essential tools. We will begin in the first chapter, **Principles and Mechanisms**, by establishing the formal definitions based on the [rank of the differential](@entry_id:635728). We will then uncover the local structure of these maps through the Constant Rank, Immersion, and Submersion Theorems, and demonstrate how [submersions](@entry_id:159709) give rise to [submanifolds](@entry_id:159439) via the crucial Regular Value Theorem. The second chapter, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, will showcase the power of these concepts by applying them to construct and analyze geometric objects in fields ranging from Riemannian and algebraic geometry to Lie theory and [mathematical physics](@entry_id:265403). Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** section offers a curated set of problems to reinforce the theoretical knowledge with concrete calculations. By navigating these chapters, the reader will gain a deep understanding of how one manifold can sit inside, fiber over, or be faithfully represented within another.

## Principles and Mechanisms

In the study of [smooth manifolds](@entry_id:160799), a central theme is understanding how one manifold can be mapped into another. A [smooth map](@entry_id:160364) $f: M \to N$ can stretch, fold, or project the manifold $M$. The local and global geometric nature of such transformations is precisely captured by the concepts of immersions, [submersions](@entry_id:159709), and [embeddings](@entry_id:158103). These notions provide a rigorous language to describe how a manifold sits inside another, how it fibers over another, and how it can be smoothly deformed. The primary tool for analyzing these properties is the differential of the map, which provides a [linear approximation](@entry_id:146101) at each point.

### The Differential as a Local Classifier

Let $f: M \to N$ be a [smooth map](@entry_id:160364) between smooth manifolds of dimensions $m$ and $n$, respectively. At any point $p \in M$, the differential of $f$ is the linear map between tangent spaces, $d f_p : T_p M \to T_{f(p)} N$. This linear map captures the first-order behavior of $f$ in a neighborhood of $p$. The fundamental properties of this [linear map](@entry_id:201112)—its [injectivity and surjectivity](@entry_id:262885)—provide the foundational definitions for classifying the local nature of $f$.

A [smooth map](@entry_id:160364) $f$ is an **immersion** at a point $p \in M$ if its differential $d f_p$ is an injective linear map. For this to be possible, the dimension of the domain's tangent space cannot exceed that of the codomain's [tangent space](@entry_id:141028); that is, we must have $m \le n$. If $f$ is an immersion at every point $p \in M$, we simply say that $f$ is an immersion. An immersion preserves the local geometric structure of $M$ by ensuring no "collapsing" of [tangent vectors](@entry_id:265494) occurs.

Conversely, a [smooth map](@entry_id:160364) $f$ is a **[submersion](@entry_id:161795)** at a point $p \in M$ if its differential $d f_p$ is a surjective [linear map](@entry_id:201112). This requires that the dimension of the domain's tangent space be at least as large as that of the codomain's, i.e., $m \ge n$. If $f$ is a submersion at every point, it is called a submersion. A submersion can be intuitively thought of as a projection, where neighborhoods in $M$ are mapped "onto" neighborhoods in $N$. A canonical example of a [submersion](@entry_id:161795) is the projection from a product manifold onto one of its factors, such as $\pi_1: S^1 \times S^1 \to S^1$. At any point $p \in S^1 \times S^1$, the [tangent space](@entry_id:141028) $T_p(S^1 \times S^1)$ is two-dimensional, while the target [tangent space](@entry_id:141028) is one-dimensional. The differential $d(\pi_1)_p$ maps this two-dimensional space onto the one-dimensional target space, satisfying the condition of [surjectivity](@entry_id:148931) [@problem_id:2990206] [@problem_id:2990206].

In the special case where the dimensions of the manifolds are equal ($m=n$), the differential $d f_p$ is a linear map between two vector spaces of the same finite dimension. From linear algebra, we know that for such a map, [injectivity](@entry_id:147722) is equivalent to [surjectivity](@entry_id:148931), and both are equivalent to the map being an [isomorphism](@entry_id:137127). Consequently, for a map $f: M^n \to N^n$, the condition for being an immersion at $p$ is identical to the condition for being a submersion at $p$. The **Inverse Function Theorem** for manifolds states that a [smooth map](@entry_id:160364) is a [local diffeomorphism](@entry_id:203529) at $p$ if and only if its differential $d f_p$ is an [isomorphism](@entry_id:137127). Therefore, for maps between manifolds of equal dimension, the concepts of immersion, [submersion](@entry_id:161795), and **[local diffeomorphism](@entry_id:203529)** coincide [@problem_id:2980349]. A map is a [local diffeomorphism](@entry_id:203529) if it restricts to a [diffeomorphism](@entry_id:147249) between some neighborhood of any point $p \in M$ and a neighborhood of $f(p) \in N$.

### Canonical Local Forms: The Constant Rank Theorem

The pointwise definitions based on the differential have profound consequences for the local geometry of the map. These consequences are unified and clarified by the **Constant Rank Theorem**. This theorem states that if a [smooth map](@entry_id:160364) $f: M^m \to N^n$ has a constant rank $k$ (where rank refers to the rank of the linear map $d f_p$) in a neighborhood of a point $p$, then there exist local [coordinate charts](@entry_id:262338) around $p$ and $f(p)$ in which the map takes a simple, canonical form.

For an immersion, the [rank of the differential](@entry_id:635728) $d f_p$ is equal to the dimension of the domain, $m$. Since the rank of a differential is a lower-semicontinuous function, if $f$ is an immersion at $p$, the rank must be at least $m$ in a neighborhood of $p$. As the rank cannot exceed $m$, it must be constantly equal to $m$ in that neighborhood. The Constant Rank Theorem then applies, yielding the **Immersion Theorem**: around any point $p$, an immersion $f: M^m \to N^n$ is locally equivalent to the standard inclusion map. That is, there exist coordinates $(x_1, \dots, x_m)$ on a neighborhood of $p$ and $(y_1, \dots, y_n)$ on a neighborhood of $f(p)$ such that the map is given by:
$$
(x_1, \dots, x_m) \mapsto (x_1, \dots, x_m, 0, \dots, 0)
$$
This local form reveals the essence of an immersion: locally, it is simply placing an $m$-dimensional space into a higher $n$-dimensional space as a flat subspace [@problem_id:2990348] [@problem_id:3033558].

For a [submersion](@entry_id:161795), the rank of $d f_p$ is equal to the dimension of the [codomain](@entry_id:139336), $n$. By a similar argument, the rank is locally constant, and the Constant Rank Theorem yields the **Submersion Theorem**. This theorem asserts that a submersion $f: M^m \to N^n$ is locally equivalent to the standard projection. In suitable [local coordinates](@entry_id:181200), the map takes the form:
$$
(x_1, \dots, x_m) \mapsto (x_1, \dots, x_n)
$$
This local form shows that a submersion behaves like a coordinate projection, "forgetting" the last $m-n$ coordinates [@problem_id:2990348] [@problem_id:3033558]. This local picture is key to understanding the structure of level sets.

### Submersions and the Geometry of Level Sets

One of the most powerful applications of [submersions](@entry_id:159709) lies in their ability to define [submanifolds](@entry_id:159439) as level sets. This is formalized by the **Regular Value Theorem**, a direct consequence of the Submersion Theorem.

First, we refine our terminology. A point $p \in M$ is a **regular point** of a [smooth map](@entry_id:160364) $f: M \to N$ if $f$ is a [submersion](@entry_id:161795) at $p$ (i.e., $d f_p$ is surjective). Otherwise, $p$ is a **critical point**. A point $q \in N$ is a **[regular value](@entry_id:188218)** of $f$ if every point in its [preimage](@entry_id:150899), $f^{-1}(q)$, is a regular point. If the preimage is empty, $q$ is also considered a [regular value](@entry_id:188218). If even one point in the preimage is critical, or if $q$ is the image of a critical point, then $q$ is a **critical value**.

The **Regular Value Theorem** states that if $q \in N$ is a [regular value](@entry_id:188218) of a [smooth map](@entry_id:160364) $f: M^m \to N^n$, then the level set $f^{-1}(q)$ is a properly **[embedded submanifold](@entry_id:273162)** of $M$ of dimension $m-n$. Furthermore, the [tangent space](@entry_id:141028) to this submanifold at any point $p \in f^{-1}(q)$ is given by the kernel of the differential:
$$
T_p(f^{-1}(q)) = \ker(d f_p)
$$
This theorem is fundamental for constructing manifolds. For instance, the sphere $S^n \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ can be defined as the level set $f^{-1}(1)$ for the function $f: \mathbb{R}^{n+1} \to \mathbb{R}$ given by $f(x) = \|x\|^2$. One can verify that $1$ is a [regular value](@entry_id:188218), proving that $S^n$ is an $n$-dimensional [submanifold](@entry_id:262388) of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ [@problem_id:2980347].

The theorem holds even in seemingly degenerate cases. Consider an open subset $V \subset \mathbb{R}^n$. We can show it is an $n$-dimensional [embedded submanifold](@entry_id:273162) of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Applying the Regular Value Theorem requires a map $F: U \to \mathbb{R}^{n-n} = \mathbb{R}^0$. The space $\mathbb{R}^0$ is a single point, $\{0\}$. The only [smooth map](@entry_id:160364) $F: U \to \mathbb{R}^0$ is the constant map $F(x)=0$. Its differential is the zero map from $T_q \mathbb{R}^n$ to $T_0 \mathbb{R}^0 = \{0\}$, which is always surjective. Thus, $0$ is always a [regular value](@entry_id:188218). The theorem's condition $V \cap U = F^{-1}(0)$ becomes $V \cap U = U$, which simplifies to $U \subseteq V$. This must hold for some open neighborhood $U$ of any point $p \in V$. This is precisely the definition of an open set. Thus, the Regular Value Theorem correctly identifies open subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$ as $n$-dimensional embedded submanifolds [@problem_id:1689838].

### Immersions versus Embeddings: The Subtleties of Topology

While the Immersion Theorem guarantees that an immersion is *locally* an embedding, it does not guarantee that the map behaves well *globally*. The stronger notion of an embedding captures this global well-behavedness.

A [smooth map](@entry_id:160364) $f: M \to N$ is an **embedding** if it is an immersion and also a **[homeomorphism](@entry_id:146933)** onto its image $f(M)$, where $f(M)$ is endowed with the subspace topology inherited from $N$. A map being a homeomorphism means it is a [continuous bijection](@entry_id:198258) with a continuous inverse. Since any [smooth map](@entry_id:160364) is continuous, the conditions for an immersion $f$ to be an embedding are:
1.  $f$ must be injective (a one-to-one map).
2.  The inverse map $f^{-1}: f(M) \to M$ must be continuous. This is equivalent to requiring that $f$ is an [open map](@entry_id:155659) onto its image: it must map open sets in $M$ to open sets in $f(M)$ (in the subspace topology).

An immersion can fail to be an embedding in two primary ways:

**1. Lack of Injectivity:** If an immersion is not injective, its image will have self-intersections. At such an intersection point, the image fails to be locally Euclidean and thus is not a manifold. A classic example is the [figure-eight curve](@entry_id:167790) in $\mathbb{R}^2$, which can be parameterized by $\gamma: S^1 \to \mathbb{R}^2$ with $\gamma(t) = (\sin(t), \sin(2t))$. This map is an immersion because its derivative never vanishes, but it is not injective, as, for instance, $\gamma(0) = \gamma(\pi) = (0,0)$. The image, a figure-eight, is not an [embedded submanifold](@entry_id:273162) because the neighborhood of the origin in the image is not homeomorphic to an open interval in $\mathbb{R}$ [@problem_id:2980336]. Similarly, the [covering map](@entry_id:154506) $p: \mathbb{R} \to S^1$ given by $p(t) = e^{it}$ is both an immersion and a [submersion](@entry_id:161795) (since the dimensions are equal and the differential is non-zero), but it is not injective and therefore not an embedding [@problem_id:2990206]. A more complex example with transverse self-intersections is given by $f: S^1 \to \mathbb{R}^2$, $f(\theta) = (\sin(2\theta), \sin(3\theta))$, which is an immersion with multiple self-crossings [@problem_id:2999397].

**2. Incorrect Image Topology:** Even if an immersion is injective, it may still fail to be an embedding. This occurs when the topology on the image $f(M)$ induced by $f$ from $M$ is strictly finer than the subspace topology inherited from $N$. A canonical example is the "irrational winding" of a line on a torus. Consider the map $\gamma: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{T}^2 = S^1 \times S^1$ given by $\gamma(t) = (e^{it}, e^{i\alpha t})$ for an irrational number $\alpha$. This map is an injective immersion. However, its image is a dense [proper subset](@entry_id:152276) of the torus. Any small [open ball](@entry_id:141481) in the torus that intersects the image will do so in a countable number of disjoint pieces. Consequently, an open set in the image (in the subspace topology) is not necessarily the image of an open interval from $\mathbb{R}$. The map $\gamma: \mathbb{R} \to \gamma(\mathbb{R})$ is not a [homeomorphism](@entry_id:146933), so $\gamma$ is not an embedding [@problem_id:2990206]. The image $\gamma(\mathbb{R})$ is an **[immersed submanifold](@entry_id:264923)**, but not an **[embedded submanifold](@entry_id:273162)**.

Fortunately, there is a powerful criterion that bypasses the need to check the topological condition directly in many situations. A [continuous bijection](@entry_id:198258) from a compact space to a Hausdorff space is always a [homeomorphism](@entry_id:146933). Since smooth manifolds are typically assumed to be Hausdorff, we have the following crucial theorem:
**An injective immersion from a [compact manifold](@entry_id:158804) $M$ into a Hausdorff manifold $N$ is always an embedding.**
This theorem is extremely useful. For example, to check if a map from the compact circle $S^1$ into $\mathbb{R}^n$ is an embedding, one only needs to verify that it is an injective immersion [@problem_id:2990206] [@problem_id:972682].

An immersion $f$ is always locally an embedding. That is, for any point $p \in M$, there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $p$ such that the restriction $f|_U: U \to N$ is an embedding. This is a direct consequence of the local normal form for immersions [@problem_id:3033558].

### Interactions with Riemannian Metrics

The concepts of immersion and [submersion](@entry_id:161795) gain further geometric significance when the manifolds are endowed with Riemannian metrics. A Riemannian metric is a smooth choice of inner product on each tangent space.

Given a [smooth map](@entry_id:160364) $f: (M, g) \to (N, h)$ between Riemannian manifolds, one can use the metric $h$ on the target manifold to define a symmetric covariant 2-tensor on the source manifold. This is the **[pullback metric](@entry_id:161465)** $f^*h$, defined pointwise by:
$$
(f^*h)_p(u, v) := h_{f(p)}(df_p u, df_p v) \quad \text{for } u, v \in T_p M
$$
This new tensor $f^*h$ is always smooth and symmetric, but it is not always positive-definite, a requirement for being a Riemannian metric. For $(f^*h)_p$ to be positive-definite, we need $(f^*h)_p(u, u) = h_{f(p)}(df_p u, df_p u) > 0$ for any non-zero vector $u \in T_p M$. Since $h$ is a Riemannian metric, $h_{f(p)}$ is an inner product, so this inequality holds if and only if $df_p u \neq 0$ for all non-zero $u$. This is precisely the condition that $df_p$ is injective. Therefore, **the pullback tensor $f^*h$ is a Riemannian metric on $M$ if and only if $f$ is an immersion** [@problem_id:2973814].

This result provides a powerful perspective: any [immersed submanifold](@entry_id:264923) $(f(M), h|_{f(M)})$ is isometric to its source manifold $M$ equipped with the [pullback metric](@entry_id:161465) $f^*h$. The map $f: (M, f^*h) \to (N,h)$ is then an [isometric immersion](@entry_id:272242).

For [submersions](@entry_id:159709), a special class of maps is of interest in Riemannian geometry. A [submersion](@entry_id:161795) $f: (M,g) \to (N,h)$ is called a **Riemannian submersion** if, at every point $p \in M$, the differential $df_p$ preserves the lengths of horizontal vectors. The [tangent space](@entry_id:141028) $T_p M$ splits into the direct sum of the **vertical space** $\mathcal{V}_p = \ker(df_p)$ and the **horizontal space** $\mathcal{H}_p = (\mathcal{V}_p)^{\perp_g}$. The condition for a Riemannian submersion is that the restriction $df_p|_{\mathcal{H}_p}: \mathcal{H}_p \to T_{f(p)}N$ is a linear isometry. This is a strong [compatibility condition](@entry_id:171102) between the metrics $g$ and $h$ and is not satisfied by an arbitrary [submersion](@entry_id:161795) between Riemannian manifolds [@problem_id:2990348].
