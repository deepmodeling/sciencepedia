Let $x = 1/13$. We compute $27x$:\n$$27x = 27 \\times \\frac{1}{13} = \\frac{27}{13} = \\frac{26+1}{13} = 2 + \\frac{1}{13} = 2 + x$$\nLet the ternary expansion of $x$ be $x = (0.a_1a_2a_3\\dots)_3 = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{a_k}{3^k}$.\nMultiplying by $27=3^3$ shifts the ternary point three places to the left:\n$$27x = (a_1a_2a_3.a_4a_5a_6\\dots)_3 = (a_1 \\cdot 3^2 + a_2 \\cdot 3^1 + a_3 \\cdot 3^0) + (0.a_4a_5a_6\\dots)_3$$\nComparing the two expressions for $27x$, we can equate the integer and fractional parts.

We can solve for $a_1, a_2, a_3$:\n- If $a_1=2$, then $9a_1=18$, which is greater than 2. Thus, $a_1=0$.\n- The equation becomes $3a_2 + a_3 = 2$. If $a_2=2$, then $3a_2=6$, which is greater than 2. Thus, $a_2=0$.\n- The equation becomes $a_3 = 2$.\nSo, the repeating block of digits is $(a_1, a_2, a_3) = (0, 0, 2)$.
