It states that for any open cover of a compact metric space, there exists a specific positive real number, known as the Lebesgue number, that provides a measure of how \"fine\" the cover is.\n\n**Theoretical Background:**\nLet $(X, d)$ be a compact metric space, and let $\\mathcal{U} = \\{U_\\alpha\\}_{\\alpha \\in A}$ be an open cover of $X$. A positive real number $\\delta$ is called a Lebesgue number for the cover $\\mathcal{U}$ if for every subset $S \\subseteq X$ with a diameter less than $\\delta$, there exists an open set $U_\\alpha \\in \\mathcal{U}$ such that $S \\subseteq U_\\alpha$. The diameter of a non-empty set $S$ is defined as $\\mathrm{diam}(S) = \\sup \\{d(x,y) \\mid x,y \\in S\\}$. The Lebesgue number for a cover, denoted as $\\delta_L$, is the supremum of all such valid numbers $\\delta$.\n\n**Problem Statement:**\nConsider the compact metric space $X = [0, 1]$ equipped with the standard Euclidean metric $d(x,y) = |x-y|$.
