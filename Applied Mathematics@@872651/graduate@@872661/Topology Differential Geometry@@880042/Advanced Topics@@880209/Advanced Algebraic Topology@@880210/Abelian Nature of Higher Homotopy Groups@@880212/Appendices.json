The proof of this relies on a \"little squares\" argument, which demonstrates that for any two homotopy classes represented by maps $\\alpha, \\beta: I^n \\to X$, the composition $\\alpha * \\beta$ is homotopic to $\\beta * \\alpha$. For $n=2$, this can be visualized as moving the supports of the maps $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ around each other within the unit square $I^2 = [0,1] \\times [0,1]$.\n\nThis problem asks you to compute a geometric quantity associated with a specific instance of such a homotopy. Let two maps, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, be represented by their square supports, $S_\\alpha$ and $S_\\beta$, within $I^2$. At any time $t \\in [0,1]$ of the homotopy, the map is given by a rescaled version of $\\alpha$ on the square $S_\\alpha(t)$ and a rescaled version of $\\beta$ on the square $S_\\beta(t)$, while the rest of $I^2$ is mapped to the basepoint.

It proceeds in three stages:\n\n**Initial State ($t=0$):**\n- $S_\\alpha(0)$ is the square $[1/4, 3/4] \\times [0, 1/2]$.\n- $S_\\beta(0)$ is the square $[1/4, 3/4] \\times [1/2, 1]$.\n\n**Stage 1: Shrinking ($t \\in [0, 1/3]$)**\n- The centers of the squares remain fixed at their initial positions.\n- The side lengths of both squares, $L_\\alpha(t)$ and $L_\\beta(t)$, decrease linearly with $t$ from their initial value of $1/2$ at $t=0$ to a final value of $1/4$ at $t=1/3$.\n\n**Stage 2: Translating ($t \\in [1/3, 2/3]$)**\n- The side lengths of both squares remain constant at $1/4$.\n- The centers of the squares, $C_\\alpha(t)$ and $C_\\beta(t)$, follow piecewise linear paths to swap their vertical positions while avoiding collision. The path for $C_\\alpha(t)$ is composed of three linear segments:\n    1. A horizontal displacement to the right.\n    2. A vertical displacement upwards.\n    3. A horizontal displacement to the left to reach its final position for this stage.\nSpecifically, $C_\\alpha(t)$ moves from its position at $t=1/3$ to the point $(3/4, 1/4)$, then to $(3/4, 3/4)$, and finally to $(1/2, 3/4)$ at $t=2/3$. The path for $C_\\beta(t)$ is symmetric, moving from $(1/2, 3/4)$ to $(1/4, 3/4)$, then to $(1/4, 1/4)$, and finally to $(1/2, 1/4)$.\n\n**Stage 3: Expanding ($t \\in [2/3, 1]$)**\n- The centers of the squares remain fixed at the positions they reached at $t=2/3$.\n- The side lengths of both squares, $L_\\alpha(t)$ and $L_\\beta(t)$, increase linearly with $t$ from $1/4$ at $t=2/3$ back to $1/2$ at $t=1$.\n\n**Problem:**\nCalculate the total path length traversed by the center of the support square $S_\\alpha(t)$, denoted $C_\\alpha(t)$, over the entire duration of the homotopy from $t=0$ to $t=1$.", "solution": "The path of the center $C_\\alpha(t)$ is analyzed in three stages:\n1.  **Stage 1 ($t \\in [0, 1/3]$):** The center is fixed.
