Note that \"1-periodic\" implies that the period $T=1$.", "solution": "**1. Analysis of Periodic Orbits**\n\nFirst, we analyze the periodic orbits of the Hamiltonian system. Hamilton's equations are:\n$$\n\\dot{q} = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial p} = p\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{p} = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial q} = - (2\\pi \\sin(2\\pi q)) = -2\\pi \\sin(2\\pi q)\n$$\nCombining these gives the second-order pendulum equation $\\ddot{q} = -2\\pi \\sin(2\\pi q)$.\n\nThe critical points (constant orbits) occur when $\\dot{q}=\\dot{p}=0$, which implies $p=0$ and $\\sin(2\\pi q)=0$. In $S^1 \\cong \\mathbb{R}/\\mathbb{Z}$, this gives two critical points:\n-   A stable equilibrium (a minimum of $H$) at $(q,p)=(0,0)$, with energy $H(0,0) = -1$.\n-   An unstable equilibrium (a saddle point of $H$) at $(q,p)=(1/2,0)$, with energy $H(1/2,0) = 1$.\n\nNon-constant periodic orbits are of two types:\n-   **Librations (oscillations):** These orbits encircle the stable equilibrium $(0,0)$ and exist for energy levels $E \\in (-1, 1)$.\n-   **Rotations:** For these orbits, $q$ is monotonic. They exist for energy levels $E>1$.\n\nLet's analyze the period $T(E)$ of these orbits.\nFor librations with energy $E$ close to $-1$, we can approximate the system. Let $E = -1 + \\mathcal{E}$ for a small positive $\\mathcal{E}$. The equation of motion is $\\ddot{q} = -2\\pi \\sin(2\\pi q)$. For small $q$, this is approximately $\\ddot{q} \\approx -4\\pi^2 q$. This is a simple harmonic oscillator with angular frequency $\\omega_0 = 2\\pi$, so its period is $T_0 = 2\\pi/\\omega_0 = 1$.\nA more detailed analysis for the anharmonic potential $V(q)=-\\cos(2\\pi q)$ shows that for small-energy orbits, the period is $T(E) \\approx 1 + \\frac{1}{16}(E+1)$. Thus, the period is strictly greater than 1 for any non-constant libration ($E>-1$).\n\nFor rotational orbits ($E>1$), the period $T_k(E)$ for an orbit wrapping $k$ times around $S^1$ is a continuous function of energy, with $T_k(E) \\to \\infty$ as $E \\to 1^+$ and $T_k(E) \\to 0$ as $E \\to \\infty$. Thus, for any $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\setminus\\{0\\}$, there exists an energy $E_k>1$ for which the period is 1.\n\nThe problem asks for a \"small-energy, non-constant, 1-periodic orbit\". This phrasing is slightly ambiguous. A rotational orbit has $E>1$, which is not small compared to the minimum energy of $-1$. A librational orbit has small energy but its period is not exactly 1. In the context of Floer theory, such a phrase often refers to the family of small-energy librations whose period approaches 1 in the limit as energy approaches the minimum. The Conley-Zehnder index is an integer and is constant for a continuous family of non-degenerate orbits. Thus, we can compute the index for any orbit in this family by taking the limit as $E \\to -1$.\n\n**2. Linearization and the Conley-Zehnder Index**\n\nWe compute the Conley-Zehnder index for a small-energy librational orbit. The index will be the same for all such orbits with energy $E \\in (-1, E_0)$ for some $E_0<1$. We can compute it by analyzing the limiting case where the orbit shrinks to the equilibrium point $(0,0)$ and its period approaches $T=1$.\n\nThe linearized equations of motion for a perturbation $\\xi = (\\delta q, \\delta p)$ around an orbit $\\gamma(t)=(q(t),p(t))$ are given by $\\dot{\\xi} = J H''(\\gamma(t))\\xi$, where $J = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}$ and $H''$ is the Hessian of $H$.\n$$ H''(q,p) = \\begin{pmatrix} 4\\pi^2\\cos(2\\pi q) & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nIn the limit $E \\to -1$, the orbit $\\gamma(t)$ shrinks to $(0,0)$. The linearized system becomes autonomous:\n$$ \\dot{\\xi} = J H''(0,0) \\xi = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 4\\pi^2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\xi = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -4\\pi^2 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\xi $$\nThis corresponds to the second-order equation for the perturbation $\\delta q$:\n$$ \\ddot{\\delta q} + 4\\pi^2 \\delta q = 0 $$\nThe fundamental matrix solution $\\Psi(t)$ with $\\Psi(0)=I$ is found by solving this equation with initial conditions $(1,0)$ and $(0,1)$ for $(\\delta q, \\dot{\\delta q})$.\nThe general solution is $\\delta q(t) = A\\cos(2\\pi t) + B\\sin(2\\pi t)$.\n1.  $(\\delta q(0), \\delta p(0)) = (1,0) \\implies A=1, B=0$. So $\\delta q(t) = \\cos(2\\pi t)$, $\\delta p(t)=\\dot{\\delta q}(t) = -2\\pi \\sin(2\\pi t)$.\n2.  $(\\delta q(0), \\delta p(0)) = (0,1) \\implies A=0, B=1/(2\\pi)$. So $\\delta q(t) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sin(2\\pi t)$, $\\delta p(t) = \\cos(2\\pi t)$.\n\nThe path of symplectic matrices is:\n$$ \\Psi(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(2\\pi t) & \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sin(2\\pi t) \\\\ -2\\pi\\sin(2\\pi t) & \\cos(2\\pi t) \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe need to find the Conley-Zehnder index of this path for $t \\in [0,1]$. A common method is to count the number of conjugate points. A time $t \\in (0,T]$ is a conjugate point if there exists a non-zero solution to the linearized equation with $\\delta q(0)=0$ and $\\delta q(t)=0$.\nThe solution with $\\delta q(0)=0$ is of the form $\\delta q(t) = B\\sin(2\\pi t)$. For this to be zero at $t \\in (0,1]$, we must have $\\sin(2\\pi t)=0$, which implies $2\\pi t=k\\pi$ for an integer $k$.\nThe solutions in the interval $(0,1]$ are $t=1/2$ and $t=1$.\nThe Conley-Zehnder index for a non-degenerate path over $[0,T]$ corresponds to the number of conjugate points in the open interval $(0,T)$. For the path corresponding to the limiting harmonic oscillator with period $T=1$, the open interval $(0,1)$ contains exactly one conjugate point at $t=1/2$.\nEach conjugate point is non-degenerate and contributes $+1$ to the index.\n\nTherefore, the Conley-Zehnder index is 1. We can confirm this using other definitions. For instance, by tracking the Lagrangian subspace spanned by the second column of $\\Psi(t)$, which is $(\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\sin(2\\pi t), \\cos(2\\pi t))$, we see it starts as $(0,1)$ (vertical), rotates clockwise, becomes vertical again at $t=1/2$ (pointing down), and returns to the start at $t=1$. It makes one positive crossing of the vertical direction (as it rotates clockwise), hence the index is 1.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "954062"}, {"introduction": "One of the most powerful applications of Floer homology is in low-dimensional topology, particularly through Heegaard Floer homology, which provides subtle invariants of 3-manifolds.
