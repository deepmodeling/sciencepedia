## Introduction
The Homological Mirror Symmetry (HMS) conjecture, proposed by Maxim Kontsevich, represents a profound and far-reaching development in modern mathematics and theoretical physics. It elevates the original physical concept of [mirror symmetry](@entry_id:158730)—a surprising duality between pairs of Calabi-Yau manifolds—to a precise mathematical statement of categorical equivalence. The conjecture addresses the fundamental question of how to formalize the link between the symplectic geometry of one space (the A-model) and the [complex algebraic geometry](@entry_id:158188) of its mirror (the B-model). This article provides a comprehensive overview of this powerful framework, designed for graduate-level readers in [geometry and physics](@entry_id:265497).

The first chapter, "Principles and Mechanisms," will lay the groundwork by defining the Fukaya category on the A-model side and the derived category of [coherent sheaves](@entry_id:158020) on the B-model side, exploring the key structures and the dictionary that translates between them. The second chapter, "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections," will demonstrate the conjecture's immense utility, showcasing how it solves problems in enumerative geometry, connects to [representation theory](@entry_id:137998), and forges new links with [knot theory](@entry_id:141161). Finally, "Hands-On Practices" will offer a chance to engage directly with the concepts through guided problems, solidifying the theoretical understanding gained in the preceding sections.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The Homological Mirror Symmetry (HMS) conjecture posits a profound and unexpected equivalence between two disparate mathematical worlds: the [symplectic geometry](@entry_id:160783) of a Calabi-Yau manifold $Y$ (the A-model) and the [complex algebraic geometry](@entry_id:158188) of a mirror Calabi-Yau manifold $X$ (the B-model). This equivalence is not merely a correspondence of numbers or properties but a full equivalence of categories, specifically, an equivalence between the Fukaya category of $Y$ and the derived category of [coherent sheaves](@entry_id:158020) on $X$. This chapter elucidates the fundamental principles and mechanisms that constitute these two sides of the duality and the dictionary that translates between them.

### The A-Model: Symplectic Geometry and the Fukaya Category

The A-model is constructed upon the foundation of symplectic geometry. Its arena is a **[symplectic manifold](@entry_id:637770)** $(Y, \omega)$, a [smooth manifold](@entry_id:156564) equipped with a closed, non-degenerate 2-form $\omega$ known as the [symplectic form](@entry_id:161619).

The primary objects of study in the A-model are **Lagrangian submanifolds**. A [submanifold](@entry_id:262388) $L \subset Y$ of dimension $n$ (where $\dim Y = 2n$) is called Lagrangian if the symplectic form vanishes when restricted to it, i.e., $\omega|_L = 0$. These [submanifolds](@entry_id:159439) can be thought of as the "calibrated" submanifolds of symplectic geometry, playing a role analogous to complex [submanifolds](@entry_id:159439) in complex geometry. They form the objects of a sophisticated algebraic structure known as the **Fukaya category**, denoted $\mathcal{F}(Y)$.

In any category, one must define not only objects but also the morphisms between them. In the Fukaya category, the space of morphisms between two Lagrangian objects, $L_1$ and $L_2$, is given by a [chain complex](@entry_id:150246) whose homology is the **Lagrangian Floer cohomology**, denoted $HF^*(L_1, L_2)$. For transversely intersecting Lagrangians, the [chain complex](@entry_id:150246) $CF^*(L_1, L_2)$ is a vector space (or module) generated by the intersection points $L_1 \cap L_2$. The differential, $\partial$, is defined by "counting" pseudo-holomorphic disks with boundary on the Lagrangians that connect pairs of intersection points. The composition of morphisms is defined by counting pseudo-holomorphic triangles. This structure endows $\mathcal{F}(Y)$ with the rich structure of an $A_\infty$-category.

A foundational example that makes this construction highly explicit is [the cotangent bundle](@entry_id:185138) $T^*Q$ of a manifold $Q$, endowed with its [canonical symplectic form](@entry_id:180641). Consider the case where $Q$ is the circle, $S^1$. The [cotangent bundle](@entry_id:161289) $T^*S^1$ is a cylinder. Two important families of Lagrangians are the zero section, $L_0 = \{(q, p) \mid p=0\}$, and the graphs of exact [1-forms](@entry_id:157984), $L_{df} = \{(q, df_q) \mid q \in Q\}$, for some function $f: Q \to \mathbb{R}$. The intersection points of $L_0$ and $L_{df}$ are precisely the points where $df=0$, which correspond to the [critical points](@entry_id:144653) of the function $f$. In this setting, the pseudo-holomorphic disks contributing to the Floer differential can be shown to correspond to the gradient flow lines of $f$. Consequently, the Floer cohomology complex $(CF^*(L_0, L_{df}), \partial)$ becomes isomorphic to the Morse homology complex of the function $f$.

This provides a powerful computational tool. For instance, let's consider [the cotangent bundle](@entry_id:185138) $T^*S^1$ with the zero section $L_0$ and a Lagrangian $L_f$ defined by the function $f(\theta) = A \cos(N\theta)$ for a positive integer $N$. The intersection points are the critical points of $f$, which are the solutions to $f'(\theta) = -AN\sin(N\theta) = 0$. This gives $2N$ [critical points](@entry_id:144653) on the circle. The function has $N$ local maxima (Morse index 1) and $N$ local minima (Morse index 0). The Floer cohomology $HF^*(L_0, L_f)$ is thus isomorphic to the Morse homology of $S^1$. The homology of the circle $S^1$ (with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients, for simplicity) is well-known: $H_0(S^1, \mathbb{Z}_2) \cong \mathbb{Z}_2$ and $H_1(S^1, \mathbb{Z}_2) \cong \mathbb{Z}_2$. Therefore, the total dimension of the Floer cohomology is $\dim HF^0 + \dim HF^1 = \dim H_0 + \dim H_1 = 1 + 1 = 2$ [@problem_id:968592]. This result is independent of $N$, illustrating a topological robustness typical of Floer-theoretic invariants.

Another crucial example is the flat [2-torus](@entry_id:265991), $T^2 = (\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})^2$, with [symplectic form](@entry_id:161619) $\omega = dx \wedge dy$. Here, simple Lagrangians can be constructed as circles with an integer slope $k$, defined by equations of the form $y = kx + c \pmod 1$. For two such Lagrangians, $L_{k_1}$ and $L_{k_2}$, it is a key result that the Floer differential is trivial. This means the Floer cohomology is simply the vector space generated by the intersection points, with no relations. The number of intersection points of $L_{k_1}$ and $L_{k_2}$ is given by $|k_1 - k_2|$. Thus, $\dim_{\mathbb{C}} HF^*(L_{k_1}, L_{k_2}) = |k_1 - k_2|$. The Fukaya category allows for direct sums of objects, and the morphism spaces behave additively. For example, the dimension of the morphism space from a combined object $L_A \oplus L_B$ to an object $L_C$ is simply the sum of the individual dimensions, yielding $|k_A - k_C| + |k_B - k_C|$ [@problem_id:968601]. This shows how the categorical structure encodes geometric intersection numbers.

### The B-Model: Complex Geometry and Derived Categories

The B-model is rooted in [complex algebraic geometry](@entry_id:158188). Its objects are not [submanifolds](@entry_id:159439) but **[coherent sheaves](@entry_id:158020)** on a complex manifold $X$. A sheaf can be thought of as a family of vector spaces parameterized by the points of $X$, varying in a holomorphic way. Standard examples include the structure sheaf $\mathcal{O}_X$ ([holomorphic functions](@entry_id:158563)), line bundles $\mathcal{O}(k)$, and skyscraper sheaves $\mathcal{O}_p$, which are supported at a single point $p \in X$. To capture the full structure predicted by [mirror symmetry](@entry_id:158730), one must consider not just individual sheaves but complexes of sheaves, leading to the **bounded derived category of [coherent sheaves](@entry_id:158020)**, $D^b(\text{Coh}(X))$.

In this category, the morphisms between two objects $E, F \in D^b(\text{Coh}(X))$ are given by the **Ext groups**, $\text{Hom}_{D^b(X)}(E, F[i]) = \text{Ext}^i_X(E, F)$, where $[i]$ denotes a shift in degree within the complex. These groups are computable using the tools of [homological algebra](@entry_id:155139), such as projective or injective resolutions.

For example, consider an elliptic curve $E$, which is a 1-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifold. Let's analyze the extensions between a "fat point" sheaf with itself. Define the sheaf $\mathcal{F}_k = \mathcal{O}_E / \mathcal{I}_p^k$, where $\mathcal{I}_p$ is the ideal sheaf of functions vanishing at a point $p$. This sheaf is supported entirely at $p$ and has dimension $k$. We can compute the dimension of the self-extension group $\text{Ext}^1_{\mathcal{O}_E}(\mathcal{F}_k, \mathcal{F}_k)$ using [local coordinates](@entry_id:181200). The calculation boils down to a computation over the local ring of germs of functions at $p$, where $\text{Ext}^1_{\mathcal{O}_{E,p}}(\mathcal{O}_p/\mathfrak{m}^k, \mathcal{O}_p/\mathfrak{m}^k) \cong \mathcal{O}_p/\mathfrak{m}^k$. The dimension of this vector space over $\mathbb{C}$ is $k$. Thus, $\dim_{\mathbb{C}} \text{Ext}^1_{\mathcal{O}_E}(\mathcal{F}_k, \mathcal{F}_k) = k$ [@problem_id:968504]. This calculation, purely algebraic in nature, will find its mirror counterpart in a Floer-theoretic computation on the A-model side.

### The Equivalence: The Mirror Map and Its Manifestations

The Homological Mirror Symmetry conjecture asserts a precise equivalence of $A_\infty$-categories:
$$
D^b(\mathcal{F}(Y)) \cong D^b(\text{Coh}(X))
$$
where $(X, Y)$ is a mirror pair. This implies that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the objects, and an [isomorphism](@entry_id:137127) between their morphism spaces:
$$
HF^*(L_1, L_2) \cong \bigoplus_{i=0}^{\dim X} \text{Ext}^i_X(\mathcal{F}_1, \mathcal{F}_2)
$$
where the Lagrangian $L_j$ is the mirror of the sheaf $\mathcal{F}_j$.

#### The Torus and SYZ Duality

For the 2-torus, the [mirror map](@entry_id:160384) has a beautiful geometric interpretation provided by the **Strominger-Yau-Zaslow (SYZ) conjecture**. It proposes that mirror Calabi-Yau manifolds should be fibered by special Lagrangian tori, and [mirror symmetry](@entry_id:158730) acts as a T-[duality transformation](@entry_id:187608) on these fibers. For a [2-torus](@entry_id:265991), the "fiber" is the torus itself. Its geometry is described by a complex structure modulus $\tau$ (shape) and a complexified Kähler modulus $t$ (size and B-field). The SYZ [mirror map](@entry_id:160384) simply swaps these two moduli.

Let's consider a torus with metric $G_{ij} = R^2 \begin{pmatrix} 1  & 1/2 \\ 1/2  & 1 \end{pmatrix}$ and B-field $B_{12} = b$. The complexified Kähler modulus is $t = B_{12} + i \sqrt{\det G}$. Here, $\det G = R^4(1 - 1/4) = \frac{3}{4}R^4$. Thus, $t = b + i \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} R^2$. The mirror torus, $\check{Y}$, will have its [complex structure](@entry_id:269128) modulus $\check{\tau}$ equal to this value: $\check{\tau} = b + i \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} R^2$ [@problem_id:968513]. This provides a concrete geometric mechanism for constructing the mirror.

On the level of categories, this correspondence is realized by the **Fourier-Mukai transform**. It maps sheaves on $X$ to sheaves on $Y$, and for the elliptic curve $E=X=Y$, it provides an explicit dictionary. A key entry in this dictionary is the map for a skyscraper sheaf $\mathcal{O}_p$ at a point $p \in E$. This B-brane is mapped to an A-brane $(L, \mathcal{L}_p)$, where $L$ is a Lagrangian sub-torus and $\mathcal{L}_p$ is a flat $U(1)$ line bundle over it. The position of the point $p$, represented by coordinates $z_p = c_1 + c_2\tau$, is encoded in the holonomies of the flat connection on $\mathcal{L}_p$. Specifically, the holonomies around the fundamental $a$ and $b$ cycles of the torus are $\text{Hol}_a = \exp(-2\pi i c_2)$ and $\text{Hol}_b = \exp(2\pi i c_1)$. The holonomy around any other cycle $C$ with homology class $[C] = q_1[a] + q_2[b]$ can then be computed multiplicatively, yielding $\text{Hol}_C = \exp(2\pi i(q_2c_1 - q_1c_2))$ [@problem_id:926277]. This shows how geometric data (position) on the B-side is transformed into symplectic and gauge-theoretic data (holonomy) on the A-side.

#### Fano Varieties and Landau-Ginzburg Models

For many manifolds, especially Fano manifolds (those with positive first Chern class), the mirror is not another manifold but a **Landau-Ginzburg (LG) model**. An LG model is a pair $(Y, W)$, where $Y$ is a [complex manifold](@entry_id:261516) (often non-compact) and $W: Y \to \mathbb{C}$ is a [holomorphic function](@entry_id:164375) called the **[superpotential](@entry_id:149670)**.

The A-model is then described by the **Fukaya-Seidel category** of $(Y, W)$, whose objects are special Lagrangians called **Lefschetz thimbles**, which are attached to the [critical points](@entry_id:144653) of $W$. The B-model is described by the category of **matrix factorizations** of $W$.

A canonical example is the mirror of the [complex projective line](@entry_id:276948), $\mathbb{CP}^1$. Its mirror is the LG model $(\mathbb{C}^*, W = z + z^{-1})$. The critical points of $W$ are found by solving $W'(z) = 1 - z^{-2} = 0$, which gives $p_1 = 1$ and $p_2 = -1$. These give rise to two fundamental Lefschetz thimbles, $\mathcal{L}_1$ and $\mathcal{L}_{-1}$. The HMS conjecture for this pair, $D^b(\text{Fuk}(\mathbb{C}^*, W)) \cong D^b(\text{Coh}(\mathbb{CP}^1))$, provides a specific dictionary: $\mathcal{L}_1 \leftrightarrow \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{CP}^1}$ and $\mathcal{L}_{-1} \leftrightarrow \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{CP}^1}(-1)$.

We can test this correspondence by comparing morphism spaces. Let's compute $\dim HF^*(\mathcal{L}_{-1}, \mathcal{L}_1)$. By HMS, this should equal $\sum_i \dim \text{Ext}^i_{\mathbb{CP}^1}(\mathcal{O}(-1), \mathcal{O})$. Using Serre duality and standard results for line bundle cohomology on $\mathbb{P}^1$, we have $\text{Ext}^i(\mathcal{O}(-1), \mathcal{O}) \cong H^i(\mathbb{P}^1, \mathcal{O}(1))$. The dimensions are $\dim H^0(\mathbb{P}^1, \mathcal{O}(1)) = 1+1=2$ and $\dim H^1(\mathbb{P}^1, \mathcal{O}(1)) = 0$. Thus, the total dimension of the morphism space is 2. This prediction about the A-model, derived from a B-model calculation, is a powerful confirmation of the conjecture's validity [@problem_id:968569].

This raises the question of how to find the mirror LG model in the first place. For toric varieties, the Batyrev-Borisov construction provides an algorithm. Given a toric Fano variety defined by a fan with primitive ray generators $\{v_i\}$, the mirror [superpotential](@entry_id:149670) is $W = \sum_i u_i$ restricted to a specific subvariety of $(\mathbb{C}^*)^d$. For the Hirzebruch surface $\mathbb{F}_1$, its fan has four vectors in $\mathbb{Z}^2$. Following the construction, one can express the four variables $u_i$ in terms of two independent coordinates, say $x=u_1$ and $y=u_4$. This leads to the [superpotential](@entry_id:149670) $W(x,y) = 2x + xy + y$. The [critical points](@entry_id:144653) of $W$ and their critical values are important invariants. For this $W$, there is a unique critical point at $(x,y) = (-1, -2)$, yielding a single critical value of $W(-1,-2) = -2$ [@problem_id:968586]. These values are conjectured to encode [quantum cohomology](@entry_id:157750) data of the original Fano manifold. This connection is further highlighted in other examples, such as the mirror to the [weighted projective space](@entry_id:157791) $\mathbb{P}(1,1,2)$, whose [superpotential](@entry_id:149670) is $W(x,y) = x+y+q/(xy^2)$. The product of its four critical values can be shown to be $-64q$, directly relating the critical locus of the B-model to the Kähler parameter $q$ of the A-model [@problem_id:968574].

The B-branes in an LG model are given by **matrix factorizations** of $W$. A [matrix factorization](@entry_id:139760) is a pair of [free modules](@entry_id:152514) $(F_0, F_1)$ with maps $d_0: F_0 \to F_1$ and $d_1: F_1 \to F_0$ such that $d_1 \circ d_0 = W \cdot \text{id}_{F_0}$ and $d_0 \circ d_1 = W \cdot \text{id}_{F_1}$. An important invariant of a B-brane is its K-theory class, represented in the **Milnor algebra** $\mathcal{Q}_W = \mathbb{C}[x_1, \dots, x_n]/(\partial_1 W, \dots, \partial_n W)$. For a potential like $W = x^n + y^n$, factorizations can be built from one-variable components, and their K-theory classes are given by products of special polynomials, yielding explicit elements in the Milnor algebra [@problem_id:968449].

### Categorical Dynamics: Autoequivalences

A deeper level of the HMS correspondence lies in the equivalence of the symmetries of the categories themselves. Groups of autoequivalences acting on one category should have corresponding counterparts on the other.

On the A-model side, the mapping [class group](@entry_id:204725) of the [symplectic manifold](@entry_id:637770) acts on the Fukaya category. A fundamental set of generators for this group are **Dehn twists**. A Dehn twist $T_\alpha$ about a Lagrangian sphere or circle $\alpha$ is an autoequivalence of $\mathcal{F}(Y)$. Its action on any other object $L_0$ is described by an exact triangle in the category:
$$
\alpha \otimes \mathrm{Hom}(L_0, \alpha) \to L_0 \to T_\alpha(L_0) \to \alpha[1] \otimes \mathrm{Hom}(L_0, \alpha)
$$
(The formula is simplified here for clarity). This means the transformed object $T_\alpha(L_0)$ is the "cone" on the [evaluation map](@entry_id:149774) from $L_0$ to $\alpha$. A simpler version of this principle appears in Fukaya categories of surfaces with boundary [@problem_id:968579]. The effect of a Dehn twist can be tracked by its action on the homology class of the Lagrangian, providing a concrete way to identify the resulting object and its intersection properties.

On the B-model side, the derived category $D^b(\text{Coh}(X))$ also possesses a group of autoequivalences. The mirror operation to a Dehn twist is known as a **spherical twist**, which is generated by a "spherical object". More generally, one can define **mutations**. Given two objects $E, F$, the right mutation of $E$ through $F$, denoted $R_F(E)$, is defined via a distinguished triangle. This is an entirely algebraic construction. For example, in $D^b(\mathbb{P}^1)$, one can perform a left mutation of $\mathcal{O}(1)$ with respect to $\mathcal{O}$ (from the exceptional pair $(\mathcal{O},\mathcal{O}(1))$). The resulting object $M$ is $\mathcal{O}(-1)[1]$, which can be analyzed using the additivity of the Chern character in exact triangles. This allows for the computation of its invariants, such as rank and degree. In this case, the degree of the underlying sheaf of $M$ is found to be $-1$ [@problem_id:968489].

The profound insight of Homological Mirror Symmetry is that these operations are mirror to each other. A Dehn twist autoequivalence on the A-side corresponds to a specific autoequivalence (often a spherical twist) on the B-side. This matching of the entire dynamical structure of the categories is one of the deepest and most powerful consequences of the conjecture, unifying the symplectic [topology of manifolds](@entry_id:267834) with the algebraic geometry of their mirrors.
