A classic example involves a Schwarzschild black hole. The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a black hole is a measure of its information content, and it is proportional to the area of its event horizon.\n\nAccording to the laws of thermodynamics, when a system with information falls into a black hole, the black hole's entropy must increase to avoid a violation of the second law. The minimal non-zero amount of information is one bit. The absorption of this single bit of information by the black hole leads to an infinitesimal increase in its mass, and consequently, an increase in its event horizon radius.\n\nAssume a non-rotating, uncharged (Schwarzschild) black hole with an initial Schwarzschild radius $R_S$. This black hole absorbs an object carrying a single bit of information. The process is considered quasi-static, and the increase in the black hole's entropy is the minimum possible amount required by information theory.\n\nGiven the following relations:\n1.
