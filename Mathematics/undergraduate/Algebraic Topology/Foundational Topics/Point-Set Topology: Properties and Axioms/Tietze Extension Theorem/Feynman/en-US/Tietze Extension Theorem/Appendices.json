Consider the function\n$$\nG(x) = d(x,a) + d(x,b).\n$$\nIf $G(x) = 0$, then $d(x,a) = 0$ and $d(x,b) = 0$, which implies $x=a$ and $x=b$, hence $a=b$, contradicting $a \\neq b$.

Define\n$$\nF(x) = \\frac{d(x,a)}{d(x,a) + d(x,b)}.\n$$\nThis is a quotient of continuous functions with a strictly positive denominator, hence $F$ is continuous on $X$.

The Tietze Extension Theorem requires the domain $X$ to be non-compact, but the disk $D^2$ is compact.",
            "solution": "We analyze the setting and the Tietze Extension Theorem carefully.\n\nFirst, $D^2$ is a compact metric space, hence normal. Therefore, the hypothesis that the domain $X$ be normal is satisfied. Next, $S^1 \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ is closed in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, and since $S^1=D^2 \\cap S^1$, it is closed in the subspace $D^2$. Thus the hypothesis that $A$ be a closed subspace of $X$ is also satisfied. The identity map $f:S^1 \\to S^1$ is continuous, so continuity is not an issue.\n\nThe classical reason there is no extension $F:D^2 \\to S^1$ with $F|_{S^1}=\\operatorname{id}_{S^1}$ is the fundamental group obstruction. Let $i:S^1 \\hookrightarrow D^2$ denote the inclusion. If such $F$ existed, then on fundamental groups,\n$(\\operatorname{id}_{S^1})_*=f_*=(F\\circ i)_*=F_*\\circ i_*.$\nBut $\\pi_1(D^2)=0$, so $i_*:\\pi_1(S^1) \\to \\pi_1(D^2)$ is the trivial homomorphism, hence $F_* \\circ i_*$ is trivial. This contradicts that $(\\operatorname{id}_{S^1})_*$ is the identity on $\\pi_1(S^1) \\cong \\mathbb{Z}$, which is nontrivial. Therefore, no such extension exists.\n\nThis nonexistence does not contradict the Tietze Extension Theorem because that theorem applies to maps whose codomain is $\\mathbb{R}^k$ (or more generally a Banach space), not to arbitrary target spaces. Here the target of $f$ is $S^1$, which is not homeomorphic to any $\\mathbb{R}^k$. Indeed, if we consider the inclusion $j:S^1 \\hookrightarrow \\mathbb{R}^2$ and the composite $j \\circ f:S^1 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$, the Tietze theorem guarantees an extension $G:D^2 \\to \\mathbb{R}^2$ of $j \\circ f$, but there is no requirement that $G$ take values in $S^1$. Requiring the image to lie in $S^1$ would contradict the fundamental group argument above. Thus, the correct explanation is that the theorem does not apply because the codomain is $S^1$ rather than $\\mathbb{R}^k$.\n\nTherefore:\n- A is false because $D^2$ is normal.\n- B is false because $S^1$ is closed in $D^2$.\n- C is true: the codomain $S^1$ is not $\\mathbb{R}^k$.\n- D is false because $f$ is continuous.\n- E is false because the theorem does not require non-compactness, and compact metric spaces are normal.\n\nHence the correct choice is C.",
