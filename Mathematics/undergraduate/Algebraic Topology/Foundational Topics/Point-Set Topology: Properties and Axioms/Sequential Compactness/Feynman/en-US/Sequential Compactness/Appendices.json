            "introduction": "Sequential compactness is a cornerstone of analysis and topology, especially within Euclidean spaces like $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The Heine-Borel theorem provides a powerful criterion: any sequence contained within a closed and bounded set is guaranteed to have a convergent subsequence. This exercise invites you to apply this theorem to a sequence whose algebraic definition, involving a spiraling motion, might seem to prevent convergence. By carefully analyzing the bounds of the sequence, you can determine whether its points are confined to a compact set, thereby practicing a crucial skill in looking past the formula to the underlying geometry of the point set.",

            "problem": "Let a sequence of points $\\{p_n\\}_{n=1}^{\\infty}$ in the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$ be defined in polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$ by $p_n = (r_n, \\theta_n)$, where $r_n = 1 + \\frac{\\sin(n)}{n+5}$ and $\\theta_n = n^2$ radians.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly answers whether this sequence must contain a convergent subsequence and provides the correct reasoning?\n\nA. Yes, because the sequence is contained within a closed and bounded set.\n\nB. No, because the angular coordinate $\\theta_n$ diverges to infinity, so the points do not approach any single point.\n\nC. No, because the sequence spirals infinitely and never settles in a small neighborhood of any point.\n\nD. Yes, because the radial coordinate $r_n$ converges to 1.\n\nE. It cannot be determined because the behavior of $\\sin(n)$ is pseudo-random and unpredictable.",
            "solution": "Let $p_{n}$ denote the point in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ with Cartesian coordinates $(x_{n},y_{n})=(r_{n}\\cos(\\theta_{n}),r_{n}\\sin(\\theta_{n}))$, where $r_{n}=1+\\frac{\\sin(n)}{n+5}$ and $\\theta_{n}=n^{2}$.\n\nFirst, bound the radial part.

Since $p_{n}\\in A$ for all $n$, the sequence lies entirely in a compact set. Therefore, by sequential compactness (equivalently, the Bolzano–Weierstrass theorem in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$), the sequence $\\{p_{n}\\}$ must contain a convergent subsequence.\n\nThe behavior of the angular coordinate $\\theta_{n}=n^{2}$ (which diverges) does not preclude the existence of convergent subsequences because the points themselves are confined to the compact annulus $A$. The reasoning “$r_{n}\\to 1$” alone does not guarantee convergence of the full sequence, but compactness guarantees the existence of a convergent subsequence. Hence the correct statement is that a convergent subsequence exists because the sequence is contained in a closed and bounded (therefore compact) set.\n\nTherefore, the correct option is A.",

It is a known fact that the space $X = \\mathbb{R} \\times S^1$ is not sequentially compact.\n\nYour task is to identify which of the following sequences $z_n = (x_n, y_n) \\in \\mathbb{R} \\times S^1$ serves as a counterexample to the sequential compactness of $X$.

Thus A has convergent subsequences.\n\nB. $x_{n}=n$ is strictly unbounded and any infinite subsequence $x_{n_{k}}=n_{k}\\to \\infty$; hence no subsequence of $x_{n}$ converges in $\\mathbb{R}$. Since convergence in the product requires convergence of both coordinates, $z_{n}$ has no convergent subsequence in $\\mathbb{R}\\times S^{1}$, regardless of $y_{n}$ (here $y_{n}=\\exp(i\\pi)=-1$).

A topological space $X$ is said to be *sequentially compact* if every sequence of points in $X$ has a subsequence that converges to a point in $X$.

The path components $\\pi_0(X)$ are the equivalence classes under path-connectedness, with the quotient topology via the surjection $p:X\\to\\pi_0(X)$.\n\nA is false. Counterexample: let $X$ be the Cantor set in $\\mathbb{R}$. It is compact, totally disconnected, and contains no nontrivial paths, so each path component is a singleton. Hence $\\pi_0(X)$ has the same cardinality as $X$, which is uncountable, so it need not be finite.\n\nB is false. The Hawaiian Earring $H=\\bigcup_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}}C_{n}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, where $C_{n}$ has center $(1/n,0)$ and radius $1/n$, is path-connected: given any two points, one can path to the common point $(0,0)$ along one circle and out along another, so there is exactly one path component.

The general fact used is: if $f:X\\to Y$ is continuous and $X$ is sequentially compact, then $f(X)$ is sequentially compact. Proof: given any sequence $(y_{n})$ in $f(X)$, choose $x_{n}\\in X$ with $f(x_{n})=y_{n}$. By sequential compactness of $X$, there exists a subsequence $(x_{n_{k}})$ converging to some $x\\in X$. By continuity, $(f(x_{n_{k}}))$ converges to $f(x)$ in $Y$. Hence every sequence in $f(X)$ has a convergent subsequence.
