This exercise makes this abstract guarantee concrete by having you calculate the largest possible Lebesgue number for a simple, intuitive open cover of the unit circle .

            "problem": "In a compact metric space $(X, d)$, an open cover $\\mathcal{U}$ is a collection of open sets whose union is $X$. The Lebesgue number lemma states that for any open cover $\\mathcal{U}$ of a compact metric space $(X, d)$, there exists a real number $\\delta > 0$, called a Lebesgue number, such that any subset of $X$ having a diameter less than $\\delta$ is contained in at least one of the sets in $\\mathcal{U}$. The diameter of a non-empty subset $A \\subseteq X$ is defined as $\\text{diam}(A) = \\sup\\{d(x, y) \\mid x, y \\in A\\}$. We are interested in the supremum of the set of all possible Lebesgue numbers for a given cover, which we will refer to as *the* Lebesgue number of the cover.\n\nConsider the unit circle $S^1$ embedded in the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$, defined as $S^1 = \\{ (x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x^2 + y^2 = 1 \\}$. The metric on $S^1$ is the standard chord distance inherited from $\\mathbb{R}^2$, given by $d(P_1, P_2) = \\sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2}$ for any two points $P_1=(x_1, y_1)$ and $P_2=(x_2, y_2)$ on $S^1$.\n\nLet $p$ be an arbitrary point on $S^1$, and let $-p$ be its antipodal point. These two points define an open cover $\\mathcal{U}$ of $S^1$ consisting of two sets:\n$U_1 = S^1 \\setminus \\{-p\\}$\n$U_2 = S^1 \\setminus \\{p\\}$\n\nDerive the Lebesgue number for this open cover $\\mathcal{U}$.",
            "solution": "We seek the largest $\\delta > 0$ such that every subset $A \\subset S^1$ with $\\text{diam}(A)  \\delta$ is contained in $U_1 = S^1 \\setminus \\{-p\\}$ or in $U_2 = S^1 \\setminus \\{p\\}$.  \nNote that $\\text{diam}(\\{p, -p\\}) = d(p, -p) = 2$.  \nIf $\\delta > 2$, then $A=\\{p, -p\\}$ has $\\text{diam}(A) = 2  \\delta$ but is not contained in either $U_1$ or $U_2$, so no larger $\\delta$ works.  \nFor $\\delta=2$, any $A$ with $\\text{diam}(A)  2$ cannot contain both $p$ and $-p$, hence it omits one of these points and lies entirely in the corresponding $U_i$.  \nTherefore the supremal Lebesgue number for $\\mathcal U$ is $2$.",

            "introduction": "Compactness plays a crucial role in the study of dynamical systems and analysis, particularly through its connection to fixed-point theorems. This practice problem explores how a continuous function that maps a compact interval to itself can generate a sequence that converges to a unique fixed point . By solving for this point, you will directly apply the principle that the limit of such a sequence must be a point that is left unchanged by the function, a foundational idea in many mathematical and computational models.",

            "problem": "A fundamental result related to sequentially compact spaces states that any sequence defined on a compact set has at least one convergent subsequence. Consider a sequence $\\{x_n\\}_{n=0}^{\\infty}$ defined on the compact interval $I = [0, 1]$. The sequence is generated by the recurrence relation:\n$$\nx_{n+1} = f(x_n) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} x_n^2 + \\beta\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are positive real constants.
