This exercise  asks you to take a \"Y\"-shaped space and identify its three outer endpoints into a single point. This practice is fundamental for visualizing how seemingly simple gluing operations can create loops, which are central to algebraic topology, and it provides a hands-on application of the Euler characteristic to determine the homotopy type of the resulting space.",

            "problem": "Let $Y$ be a topological space constructed as a subset of the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$. It is formed by the union of three closed line segments, each of length 1, that meet at a common endpoint at the origin $O=(0,0)$. The segments are defined as:\n$I_1 = \\{(x, 0) \\mid 0 \\le x \\le 1\\}$\n$I_2 = \\{(-x/2, x\\sqrt{3}/2) \\mid 0 \\le x \\le 1\\}$\n$I_3 = \\{(-x/2, -x\\sqrt{3}/2) \\mid 0 \\le x \\le 1\\}$\nSo, the space is $Y = I_1 \\cup I_2 \\cup I_3$. The endpoints of these segments that are not at the origin are $P_1 = (1,0)$, $P_2 = (-1/2, \\sqrt{3}/2)$, and $P_3 = (-1/2, -\\sqrt{3}/2)$.\n\nLet $X$ be the quotient space obtained from $Y$ by identifying the three non-origin endpoints. That is, $X = Y/\\sim$, where $\\sim$ is the smallest equivalence relation on $Y$ generated by the relations $P_1 \\sim P_2$ and $P_2 \\sim P_3$.\n\nTo which of the following standard topological spaces is the quotient space $X$ homotopy equivalent?\n\nA.

            "solution": "The space $Y$ is the union of three closed segments $I_1, I_2, I_3$ meeting at the origin $O$, with other endpoints $P_1, P_2, P_3$. Topologically, $Y$ is a finite connected $1$-dimensional CW complex (a graph) with vertex set $\\{O, P_1, P_2, P_3\\}$ and edge set consisting of the three segments joining $O$ to $P_i$ for $i=1,2,3$.\n\nIn the quotient $X = Y/\\sim$, the three endpoints $P_1, P_2, P_3$ are identified to a single point, say $Q$. Therefore, $X$ is a graph with vertex set $\\{O, Q\\}$ and three edges, each an image of one of the original segments, connecting $O$ to $Q$. This is the standard theta graph with two vertices and three parallel edges between them. As a finite graph, $X$ is a connected $1$-dimensional CW complex and hence is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of circles; the number of circles equals the first Betti number.\n\nTo determine the number of circles in the wedge, we use the Euler characteristic, which is a homotopy invariant. For a finite connected graph with $V$ vertices and $E$ edges, the Euler characteristic is\n$$\n\\chi = V - E.\n$$\nFor a wedge of $k$ circles, $\\bigvee_{i=1}^{k} S^{1}$, the Euler characteristic is\n$$\n\\chi = 1 - k.\n$$\nIf a connected graph is homotopy equivalent to a wedge of $k$ circles, then these Euler characteristics must agree:\n$$\nV - E = 1 - k \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad k = E - V + 1.\n$$\nFor $X$, we have $V = 2$ and $E = 3$, hence\n$$\nk = 3 - 2 + 1 = 2.\n$$\nTherefore, $X$ is homotopy equivalent to the wedge sum of two circles, $S^{1} \\vee S^{1}$, which corresponds to option D.",

View $X$ as a CW complex as follows.\n\nThere is exactly one $0$-cell (the image of the three vertices). Each of the three edges of $T$ becomes a loop based at this $0$-cell, hence the $1$-skeleton is a wedge of three circles. Denote the three $1$-cells by $a,b,c$. The $2$-cell (the interior of the triangle) is attached along the boundary of the triangle, which traverses the three edges in order. Choosing orientations consistently, the attaching map of the $2$-cell represents the word $abc$ in the free group on $\\{a,b,c\\}$.\n\nUsing the cellular chain complex, we have\n$$\n0 \\longrightarrow C_{2}\\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\xrightarrow{\\ \\partial_{2}\\ } C_{1}\\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{3} \\xrightarrow{\\ \\partial_{1}\\ } C_{0}\\cong \\mathbb{Z} \\longrightarrow 0.\n$$\nBecause all $1$-cells begin and end at the single $0$-cell, $\\partial_{1}=0$. The boundary of the $2$-cell wraps once around each of $a,b,c$, so with suitable orientations,\n$$\n\\partial_{2}(1)=(1,1,1).\n$$\nTherefore, $H_{2}(X)\\cong \\ker(\\partial_{2})=0$, $H_{1}(X)\\cong \\ker(\\partial_{1})/\\operatorname{im}(\\partial_{2})\\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{3}/\\langle(1,1,1)\\rangle\\cong \\mathbb{Z}^{2}$, and $H_{0}(X)\\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\nThis matches the homology of the wedge $S^{1}\\vee S^{1}$.\n\nMore strongly, there is an explicit elementary collapse. The attaching map of the unique $2$-cell uses the $1$-cell $c$ exactly once and no other $2$-cells are present, so $c$ is a free face of the $2$-cell. Hence the pair consisting of the $2$-cell and the $1$-cell $c$ collapses to a subcomplex, yielding a strong deformation retract of $X$ onto the subcomplex consisting of the two remaining $1$-cells $a$ and $b$, i.e., onto $S^{1}\\vee S^{1}$. Consequently,\n$$\nX\\simeq S^{1}\\vee S^{1}.\n$$\nThus the correct choice is the wedge sum of two circles.",

            "introduction": "We now advance to a more dynamic type of construction where the identification is guided by a function. This practice  starts with a cylinder and glues the top circle to the bottom circle using a rule involving complex conjugation, which acts as a reflection.
