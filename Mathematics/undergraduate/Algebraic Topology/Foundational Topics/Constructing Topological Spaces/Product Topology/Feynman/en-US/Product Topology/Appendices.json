The basis for the product topology on a space like $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathbb{R}$ consists of open \"rectangles.\" This exercise  invites you to a thought experiment: can a familiar shape like an open disk be represented as a simple Cartesian product? By exploring this question, you will gain a more concrete understanding of the structure of open sets in a product space.",

            "problem": "Consider the open disk $D$ in the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$ centered at the origin with a radius of 1. This set is defined as $D = \\{ (x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 \\mid x^2 + y^2 < 1 \\}$.\n\nAn analyst proposes that this disk $D$ can be precisely represented as the Cartesian product of two non-empty open subsets $U$ and $V$ of the real line $\\mathbb{R}$, i.e., $D = U \\times V$.\n\nTo test this proposition, we examine two points that are known to be inside the disk: $P_1 = (0.8, 0)$ and $P_2 = (0, 0.8)$. If the analyst's proposition is correct, the properties of the Cartesian product impose certain constraints on the sets $U$ and $V$, and consequently on the points that must belong to $D$.\n\nAssuming the analyst's proposition that $D = U \\times V$ is true, which one of the following statements is a necessary logical consequence?\n\nA. The point $(0.8, 0.8)$ must be an element of $D$.\n\nB. The point $(-0.8, -0.8)$ must be an element of $D$.\n\nC. The set $U$ must be equal to the set $V$.\n\nD. The sets $U$ and $V$ must both be equal to the open interval $(-1, 1)$.\n\nE. The square defined by $[-0.8, 0.8] \\times [-0.8, 0.8]$ must be a subset of $D$.",
            "solution": "We are given the open unit disk $D=\\{(x,y)\\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}: x^{2}+y^{2}<1\\}$ and we assume, for contradiction’s sake, that there exist non-empty open sets $U,V \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ such that $D=U \\times V$.\n\nBy the definition of Cartesian product,\n$$\nU \\times V=\\{(u,v)\\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}: u \\in U,\\, v \\in V\\}.\n$$\nTherefore, from $(0.8,0)\\in D=U \\times V$ we must have\n$$\n0.8 \\in U \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 0 \\in V,\n$$\nand from $(0,0.8)\\in D=U \\times V$ we must have\n$$\n0 \\in U \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 0.8 \\in V.\n$$\nCombining these, we obtain\n$$\n0.8 \\in U \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 0.8 \\in V.\n$$\nUsing again the definition of Cartesian product, if $u \\in U$ and $v \\in V$ then $(u,v) \\in U \\times V$.

            "introduction": "A primary reason for defining a topology is to have a rigorous notion of continuous functions. Having explored the basic open sets of a product space, we can now investigate the continuity of maps between these spaces. This practice  focuses on the diagonal map, a fundamental function in this context, providing a perfect opportunity to apply the definition of continuity in the product topology and solidify your understanding of how it works.",

            "problem": "Let $X$ be an arbitrary topological space, and let $X \\times X$ be the product space endowed with the product topology. The basis for the product topology on $X \\times X$ consists of all sets of the form $U \\times V$, where $U$ and $V$ are open sets in $X$. Consider the diagonal map $\\Delta: X \\to X \\times X$ defined by the rule $\\Delta(x) = (x,x)$ for all $x \\in X$.\n\nWhich one of the following statements is universally true for any choice of the topological space $X$?\n\nA. The map $\\Delta$ is always an open map.\n\nB. The map $\\Delta$ is always a closed map.\n\nC. The image of the diagonal map, $\\Delta(X)$, is always a closed set in $X \\times X$.\n\nD. The map $\\Delta$ is always a continuous map.\n\nE. The map $\\Delta$ is continuous if and only if $X$ has the discrete topology.",
            "solution": "We analyze the diagonal map $\\Delta:X\\to X\\times X$ defined by $\\Delta(x)=(x,x)$ under the product topology on $X\\times X$ whose basis consists of sets $U\\times V$ with $U,V$ open in $X$.\n\nFirst, we test continuity of $\\Delta$. It suffices to compute the preimage of a basic open set. Let $U,V\\subseteq X$ be open. Then\n$$\n\\Delta^{-1}(U\\times V)=\\{x\\in X:(x,x)\\in U\\times V\\}=\\{x\\in X:x\\in U\\text{ and }x\\in V\\}=U\\cap V,\n$$\nwhich is open in $X$. Since arbitrary unions of such basic sets generate the topology on $X\\times X$, and preimages preserve unions and finite intersections, it follows that $\\Delta$ is continuous for every topological space $X$. Therefore, statement D is true.\n\nNext, we show that $\\Delta$ need not be an open map. If $X$ is not discrete, choose a nonempty open $U\\subseteq X$. Suppose, towards a contradiction, that $\\Delta(U)$ is open in $X\\times X$. Fix $x\\in U$. Then there exist open sets $A,B\\subseteq X$ with $x\\in A\\cap B$ and\n$$\nA\\times B\\subseteq \\Delta(U)\\subseteq \\Delta(X)=\\{(y,y):y\\in X\\}.\n$$\nFor any $a\\in A$ and $b\\in B$, we must have $(a,b)\\in A\\times B\\subseteq \\Delta(X)$, hence $a=b$. This forces that $A$ and $B$ can contain at most one point each and must in fact satisfy $A=B=\\{x\\}$. Thus $\\{x\\}$ is open. As $x\\in U$ was arbitrary and $U$ nonempty, this forces singletons to be open, i.e., $X$ is discrete. Hence, unless $X$ is discrete, $\\Delta(U)$ cannot be open. For a concrete counterexample, take $X=\\mathbb{R}$ with the usual topology: for any nonempty open $U$, the set $\\Delta(U)$ is not open in $\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{R}$ because every basic neighborhood $A\\times B$ of a point $(x,x)$ contains points $(a,b)$ with $a\\neq b$, hence not contained in the diagonal. Therefore, statement A is false in general.\n\nWe now address whether $\\Delta$ is always a closed map and whether $\\Delta(X)$ is always closed. It is a standard fact that $X$ is Hausdorff if and only if the diagonal $\\Delta(X)$ is closed in $X\\times X$. Thus, for a non-Hausdorff space, $\\Delta(X)$ is not closed. As a specific counterexample, consider the Sierpiński space $X=\\{0,1\\}$ with open sets $\\{\\varnothing,\\{1\\},\\{0,1\\}\\}$. Then\n$$\n\\Delta(X)=\\{(0,0),(1,1)\\}\\subset X\\times X,\n$$\nand its complement $\\{(0,1),(1,0)\\}$ is not open because any basic neighborhood $U\\times V$ of $(0,1)$ must have $U$ open containing $0$ and $V$ open containing $1$, hence $U=\\{0,1\\}$ and $V\\in\\{\\{1\\},\\{0,1\\}\\}$, yielding $U\\cap V\\neq\\varnothing$ and thus $(x,x)\\in U\\times V$ for some $x$, so $U\\times V$ meets the diagonal. Therefore $\\Delta(X)$ is not closed in this space. Consequently, statement C is false in general. Furthermore, if $\\Delta$ were always a closed map, then $\\Delta(X)$ (the image of the closed set $X$) would always be closed, contradicting the counterexample above. Hence statement B is also false in general.\n\nFinally, statement E is false because we have shown $\\Delta$ is continuous for every $X$, not only for discrete $X$.\n\nTherefore, the only universally true statement is D.",
