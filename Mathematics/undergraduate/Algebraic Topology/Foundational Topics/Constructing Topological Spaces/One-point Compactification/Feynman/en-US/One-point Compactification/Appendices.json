This first exercise  provides a foundational example of this principle, asking you to identify the one-point compactification of the space of all $n \\times m$ matrices. By recognizing that this space is topologically equivalent to a standard Euclidean space, you will see how the process of compactification results in a simple and fundamental geometric shape.",

            "problem": "Consider the space $M_{n,m}(\\mathbb{R})$, which is the set of all $n \\times m$ matrices with real entries, for integers $n, m \\ge 1$. This space is equipped with its standard topology, which is induced by viewing it as a Euclidean space of the appropriate dimension. Let $(\\cdot)^*$ denote the one-point compactification of a topological space $X$.\n\nWhich of the following topological spaces is homeomorphic to the one-point compactification of $M_{n,m}(\\mathbb{R})$? For the options, let $S^k$ denote the $k$-dimensional sphere, $\\mathbb{R}P^k$ the $k$-dimensional real projective space, and $T^k = \\prod_{i=1}^{k} S^1$ the $k$-dimensional torus.\n\nA.

            "solution": "We identify $M_{n,m}(\\mathbb{R})$ with $\\mathbb{R}^{nm}$ as topological spaces via the linear bijection that lists the $nm$ entries of a matrix as coordinates in $\\mathbb{R}^{nm}$. This map is a homeomorphism because it is linear, bijective, and both it and its inverse are continuous with respect to the standard Euclidean topologies.\n\nLet $d=nm$. The one-point compactification of $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is homeomorphic to $S^{d}$. This follows from stereographic projection: there exists a homeomorphism between $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and $S^{d}\\setminus\\{N\\}$, where $N$ is the north pole of $S^{d}$. Adding a single point at infinity to $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ corresponds precisely to adding back the point $N$, yielding $S^{d}$.

For completeness, note that:\n- $\\mathbb{R}P^{nm}$ is obtained by identifying antipodal points on $S^{nm}$ and is not homeomorphic to the one-point compactification of $\\mathbb{R}^{nm}$ in general (for $nm\\geq 2$, $S^{nm}$ is simply connected whereas $\\mathbb{R}P^{nm}$ is not).\n- $S^{n}\\times S^{m}$ has dimension $n+m$, not $nm$.\n- $T^{nm}$ has nontrivial fundamental group $\\mathbb{Z}^{nm}$ and is not a one-point compactification of a Euclidean space.\n\nHence the correct choice is $S^{nm}$.",

            "problem": "In topology, the one-point compactification $X^*$ of a non-compact, locally compact Hausdorff space $X$ is formed by adding a single point \"at infinity\", denoted $\\infty$, and defining the open sets of $X^*$ to be the open sets of $X$ along with sets of the form $U \\cup \\{\\infty\\}$, where $U$ is an open subset of $X$ such that $X \\setminus U$ is compact.

            "solution": "We analyze each option by describing its one-point compactification and comparing it to the figure-eight, which is the wedge sum $S^{1} \\vee S^{1}$.\n\nFor $X_{A} = \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\setminus \\{(0,0)\\}$: This space is homeomorphic to the cylinder $S^1 \\times \\mathbb{R}$. Its one-point compactification adds a single point at infinity that connects both \"ends\" of the cylinder (corresponding to sequences approaching the origin and sequences escaping to infinity in the plane). The resulting space is the suspension of the circle, $\\Sigma S^1$, which is homeomorphic to the 2-sphere, $S^2$. A sphere is not homeomorphic to a figure-eight; for example, $S^2$ is simply connected, whereas the fundamental group of a figure-eight is non-abelian. Hence $X_{A}^*$ is not homeomorphic to a figure-eight.\n\nFor $X_{B} = \\{(x,y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} \\mid xy=0\\}$ (the two coordinate axes meeting at the origin): Each axis is a copy of $\\mathbb{R}$, and they intersect at one point. The one-point compactification adds a single point $\\infty$ that serves as the common “end” for both axes. Each axis becomes a circle after adding $\\infty$, but because the axes already meet at the origin, the resulting compactification is the union of two circles intersecting in two points (the original origin and $\\infty$), not a wedge at a single point. Therefore $X_{B}^{*}$ is not a figure-eight.\n\nFor $X_{C} = \\{(x,e^x) \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\}$: This graph is homeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}$.

A general fact is that for a disjoint union $X \\sqcup Y$ of locally compact, non-compact Hausdorff spaces, the one-point compactification $(X \\sqcup Y)^{*}$ is obtained by taking $X^*$ and $Y^*$ and identifying their added points at infinity. Since each $\\mathbb{R}^* \\cong S^{1}$, we obtain $(\\mathbb{R} \\sqcup \\mathbb{R})^{*} \\cong S^{1} \\vee S^{1}$, which is exactly the figure-eight. Thus $X_{D}^{*}$ is homeomorphic to a figure-eight.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is D.",
