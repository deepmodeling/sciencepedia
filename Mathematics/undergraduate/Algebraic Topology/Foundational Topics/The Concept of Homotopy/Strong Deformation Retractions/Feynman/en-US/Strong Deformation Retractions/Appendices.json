A strong deformation retraction provides a continuous \"recipe\" to shrink a space onto a subspace, defining a specific path for each point. This first practice makes this idea tangible by asking you to calculate the length of such a path for a point inside a cube as it retracts to the main diagonal, grounding the abstract notion of a homotopy in familiar vector geometry.

Consider the specific homotopy $H: X \\times [0,1] \\to X$ constructed as follows: for any point $P \\in X$, its path from time $t=0$ to $t=1$ is the straight line segment connecting $P$ to its orthogonal projection onto the line containing the diagonal $A$.

            "introduction": "Just as important as knowing how to construct a retraction is understanding when one is impossible. This is where the true power of algebraic topology comes into play, by revealing underlying algebraic obstructions. This problem explores a fascinating scenario with a knotted solid torus to demonstrate that even if two spaces seem similar, a property related to their fundamental groups can fundamentally prevent one from deforming onto the other.

            "problem": "Consider a standard solid torus, which we will denote by $X$. Topologically, $X$ is the product space $S^1 \\times D^2$, where $S^1$ is the unit circle and $D^2$ is the closed unit disk. A standard representation of $X$ in three-dimensional space is the volume swept by rotating a disk about an axis that does not intersect the disk. The fundamental group of this space, $\\pi_1(X)$, is known to be isomorphic to the group of integers, $\\mathbb{Z}$. The integer corresponding to a given loop in $X$ is called its winding number, which intuitively counts how many times the loop goes around the \"long way\" of the torus. A loop representing the generator $1 \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ is called a core circle of the torus.\n\nNow, consider a subspace $A$ which is embedded in the interior of $X$. This subspace $A$ is itself topologically a solid torus, but it is embedded in a \"knotted\" fashion. This means that the core circle of $A$ (which is a closed loop within $X$) has a winding number $n$ such that $|n| \\neq 1$. For this problem, let's assume the core circle of $A$ has a winding number of $n=2$.\n\nA strong deformation retraction of a space $X$ onto a subspace $A$ is a continuous map that shrinks $X$ onto $A$ while keeping the points of $A$ fixed throughout the process. Which of the following statements provides the correct and most fundamental reason why no strong deformation retraction from $X$ onto the knotted sub-torus $A$ can exist?\n\nA. The fundamental group of $A$, $\\pi_1(A)$, is not isomorphic to the fundamental group of $X$, $\\pi_1(X)$.\n\nB. The Euler characteristic of $A$ is different from the Euler characteristic of $X$.\n\nC. The subspace $A$ is not a compact subset of $X$.\n\nD. The homomorphism $\\pi_1(A) \\to \\pi_1(X)$ induced by the inclusion map is not an isomorphism.\n\nE. The inclusion map $i: A \\to X$ induces a trivial homomorphism on their fundamental groups (i.e., it maps every element to the identity).",
            "solution": "We begin by identifying the fundamental groups of the spaces involved. Since $X=S^1 \\times D^2$ and $D^2$ is contractible, the Kunneth-type product for fundamental groups yields\n$$\n\\pi_{1}(X)\\cong \\pi_{1}(S^1)\\times \\pi_{1}(D^2)\\cong \\mathbb{Z}\\times 0\\cong \\mathbb{Z}.\n$$\nLikewise, $A$ is a solid torus, so\n$$\n\\pi_{1}(A)\\cong \\mathbb{Z}.\n$$\nTherefore statement A is false because $\\pi_{1}(A)\\cong \\pi_{1}(X)\\cong \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nNext, consider Euler characteristics. Using multiplicativity for products and $\\chi(S^1)=0$, $\\chi(D^2)=1$, we have\n$$\n\\chi(X)=\\chi(S^1\\times D^2)=\\chi(S^1)\\chi(D^2)=0,\n$$\nand similarly $\\chi(A)=0$. Thus B is false, and in any case Euler characteristic agreement does not guarantee the existence of a strong deformation retraction.\n\nThe space $A\\cong S^1\\times D^2$ is compact as a product of compact spaces, and it sits as a closed subset in the compact $X$, so C is false.\n\nNow analyze the inclusion-induced homomorphism on fundamental groups. Let $i:A\\hookrightarrow X$ be the inclusion. By the definition of winding number, if the core circle of $A$ winds $n$ times around the core of $X$, then on fundamental groups, under the identifications $\\pi_{1}(A)\\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ and $\\pi_{1}(X)\\cong \\mathbb{Z}$ with chosen generators given by their respective core circles, the induced map is\n$$\ni_{*}:\\pi_{1}(A)\\to \\pi_{1}(X),\\quad i_{*}(1)=n.\n$$\nFor the given $n=2$, this is the homomorphism\n$$\ni_{*}:\\mathbb{Z}\\to \\mathbb{Z},\\quad k\\mapsto 2k,\n$$\nwhich is injective but not surjective, hence not an isomorphism. Therefore statement E is false (the map is not trivial), and crucially $i_{*}$ is not an isomorphism, so D is true as a statement about the map.\n\nFinally, connect this to strong deformation retractions. If there were a strong deformation retraction of $X$ onto $A$, then $A$ would be a deformation retract of $X$, and the inclusion $i:A\\to X$ would be a homotopy equivalence. A fundamental theorem in algebraic topology states that a homotopy equivalence induces isomorphisms on all homotopy groups, in particular on $\\pi_{1}$. Thus $i_{*}$ would have to be an isomorphism. Since in our case $i_{*}$ is multiplication by $2$, it is not an isomorphism. This contradiction shows that no strong deformation retraction from $X$ onto $A$ can exist. Therefore the correct and most fundamental reason is that the inclusion-induced homomorphism on $\\pi_{1}$ is not an isomorphism, i.e., statement D.",
