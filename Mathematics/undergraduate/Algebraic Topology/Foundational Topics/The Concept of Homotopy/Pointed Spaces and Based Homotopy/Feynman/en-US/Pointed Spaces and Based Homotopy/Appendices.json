This exercise provides a concrete scenario to explore how the structure of the target space affects this possibility.

Since the domain is $S^0 = \\{-1, 1\\}$, such a map is completely determined by its value at the point $-1$.\n\nWe define a family of based maps $f_k: (S^0, 1) \\to (X, 0)$ parameterized by a real number $k$.
