            "introduction": "Understanding the expected size of a population is a foundational step in analyzing branching processes. This first practice explores how to predict the average number of individuals in a future generation, starting from a single ancestor. By working through this problem , you will apply the core principle that the expected size of generation $n$, denoted $\\mathbb{E}[Z_n]$, is determined by the mean offspring number, $\\mu$, through the simple relationship $\\mathbb{E}[Z_n] = \\mu^n$. This exercise provides a fundamental intuition for the exponential nature of population growth or decline in these models.",

            "problem": "A biologist is studying a newly discovered, harmless genetic mutation. The study begins with a single organism, which constitutes generation 0. This organism and its descendants pass on the mutation according to a specific probabilistic rule. The number of direct offspring, $k$, that inherit the mutation from any single parent is a random variable following a geometric distribution. The probability mass function for this distribution is given by:\n$$P(k) = (1-p)^k p$$\nfor $k = 0, 1, 2, \\dots$.\n\nFor this particular mutation, the parameter $p$ has been determined to be $p = 1/3$.

By assumption, $K$ has the geometric distribution on $\\{0,1,2,\\dots\\}$ with\n$$\n\\Pr(K=k) = (1-p)^{k} p, \\quad k=0,1,2,\\dots\n$$\nIts mean is\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[K] = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} k \\, p (1-p)^{k}.\n$$\nLet $r = 1-p$ with $|r|<1$.

            "introduction": "While expected population size gives us an average trajectory, it doesn't tell the whole story. A crucial question is whether a population will eventually die out or have a chance to survive indefinitely. This exercise  introduces the powerful method of using an offspring's probability generating function (PGF), $G(s)$, to calculate the probability of extinction, $q$. You will learn to find $q$ by solving the fixed-point equation $s = G(s)$ and selecting the appropriate root, a cornerstone technique for analyzing the long-term fate of any branching process.",

            "problem": "A simplified model for the proliferation of a \"digi-clone,\" a type of self-replicating digital entity, is described by a branching process. In each generation, every existing digi-clone attempts to create two new copies of itself on separate network nodes. Each creation attempt is independent and succeeds with a probability $p=0.6$. After the replication attempts, the original digi-clone is deactivated. The process begins in generation 0 with a single digi-clone. Extinction is the event that the population of digi-clones eventually becomes zero. Calculate the probability of eventual extinction. Express your final answer as an exact fraction in simplest form.",
            "solution": "Model the number of offspring per digi-clone as a Galton–Watson branching process. Each digi-clone makes two independent replication attempts, each succeeding with probability $p=0.6$, so the offspring distribution is $X \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(2,p)$.
