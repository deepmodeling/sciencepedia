            "introduction": "To begin our hands-on exploration, we start with a classic geometric example. This problem invites you to visualize a probability distribution as a physical region and conditioning as the act of slicing through it. By determining the conditional distribution of one coordinate given the other for a point chosen uniformly from a parabolic region, you'll build a strong intuitive foundation for how conditional densities are derived directly from the geometry of the joint sample space .",

            "problem": "A point with coordinates $(X, Y)$ is selected at random from a region $\\mathcal{R}$ in the Cartesian plane. The selection follows a uniform probability distribution over $\\mathcal{R}$. The region $\\mathcal{R}$ is defined as the set of all points $(x, y)$ satisfying the inequalities $x^2 \\le y \\le 1$.\n\nConsider a specific outcome where the $y$-coordinate is observed to be $Y=y$, for some value $y$ such that $0 < y < 1$. The task is to determine the nature of the conditional probability distribution of the random variable $X$ given this observation.\n\nWhich of the following descriptions accurately characterizes the conditional distribution of $X$ given $Y=y$?\n\nA. A Uniform distribution on the interval $[-\\sqrt{y}, \\sqrt{y}]$\n\nB. A Uniform distribution on the interval $[-1, 1]$\n\nC. A Normal distribution with a mean of 0 and variance of $y$\n\nD. A distribution with a parabolic probability density function on the interval $[-1, 1]$\n\nE. An Exponential distribution on the interval $[0, \\infty)$",
            "solution": "Let $\\mathcal{R}=\\{(x,y): x^{2}\\leq y\\leq 1\\}$. Since the selection is uniform over $\\mathcal{R}$, the joint density has the form\n$$\nf_{X,Y}(x,y)=c \\quad \\text{for }(x,y)\\in \\mathcal{R}, \\quad \\text{and }0\\text{ otherwise},\n$$\nwhere $c$ is determined by normalization.

This is exactly the density of a Uniform distribution on the interval $[-\\sqrt{y},\\sqrt{y}]$ because the length of the interval is $2\\sqrt{y}$ and the constant density equals its reciprocal.\n\nHence, the correct description is a Uniform distribution on $[-\\sqrt{y},\\sqrt{y}]$.",

            "introduction": "Building on the two-dimensional case, we now extend the concept of conditioning to three dimensions. This practice involves a point chosen uniformly from a tetrahedron, a fundamental shape in geometry . Your task is to find the conditional distribution of the height $Z$ given the position $(X,Y)$ on the base plane, which reinforces the \"slicing\" analogy and solidifies the computational steps for deriving conditional distributions in a multivariable setting.",

The vertices of this tetrahedron are located at the points $(0,0,0)$, $(1,0,0)$, $(0,1,0)$, and $(0,0,1)$.\n\nConsider an observation where the values of the first two coordinates are known, such that $X=x$ and $Y=y$, with the constraints that $x > 0$, $y > 0$, and $x+y < 1$.\n\nDetermine the value of the conditional probability density function of the random variable $Z$ for outcomes within its valid range, given that $X=x$ and $Y=y$. Express your answer as a symbolic expression in terms of $x$ and $y$.",
            "solution": "Let $T$ be the tetrahedron with vertices at $(0,0,0)$, $(1,0,0)$, $(0,1,0)$, and $(0,0,1)$. The plane passing through the three non-origin vertices $(1,0,0)$, $(0,1,0)$, and $(0,0,1)$ is given by the equation $x+y+z=1$. The tetrahedron $T$ is the region in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ defined by the inequalities:\n$$ x \\ge 0, \\quad y \\ge 0, \\quad z \\ge 0, \\quad x+y+z \\le 1 $$\n\nThe first step is to find the joint probability density function (PDF) of the random vector $(X, Y, Z)$, denoted by $f_{X,Y,Z}(x,y,z)$. Since the distribution is uniform over the volume of the tetrahedron $T$, the joint PDF is constant within $T$ and zero otherwise. The value of this constant is the reciprocal of the volume of $T$.\n\nThe volume of a tetrahedron with one vertex at the origin and the other three vertices given by vectors $\\vec{a}$, $\\vec{b}$, and $\\vec{c}$ is $V = \\frac{1}{6} |(\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b}) \\cdot \\vec{c}|$. In our case, $\\vec{a} = (1,0,0)$, $\\vec{b} = (0,1,0)$, and $\\vec{c} = (0,0,1)$.\nThe cross product is:\n$$ \\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b} = (1,0,0) \\times (0,1,0) = (0,0,1) $$\nThe dot product is:\n$$ (\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{b}) \\cdot \\vec{c} = (0,0,1) \\cdot (0,0,1) = 1 $$\nSo, the volume of the tetrahedron is:\n$$ V = \\frac{1}{6} |1| = \\frac{1}{6} $$\nThe joint PDF is therefore:\n$$ f_{X,Y,Z}(x,y,z) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{V} = 6 & \\text{if } (x,y,z) \\in T \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} $$\n\nThe next step is to find the marginal PDF of the pair $(X,Y)$, denoted by $f_{X,Y}(x,y)$. This is obtained by integrating the joint PDF over all possible values of $z$.\n$$ f_{X,Y}(x,y) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f_{X,Y,Z}(x,y,z) \\, dz $$\nFor a fixed pair $(x,y)$, the possible range of $z$ is determined by the inequalities defining $T$: $z \\ge 0$ and $z \\le 1-x-y$. Thus, the integration is from $0$ to $1-x-y$. The marginal PDF is non-zero only for $(x,y)$ in the triangular region $S$ defined by $x \\ge 0, y \\ge 0, x+y \\le 1$. For $(x,y) \\in S$:\n$$ f_{X,Y}(x,y) = \\int_{0}^{1-x-y} 6 \\, dz = 6 [z]_{0}^{1-x-y} = 6(1-x-y) $$\nSo, the marginal PDF is $f_{X,Y}(x,y) = 6(1-x-y)$ for $(x,y)$ in the support region $S$, and 0 otherwise.\n\nThe problem asks for the conditional PDF of $Z$ given $X=x$ and $Y=y$, which is denoted by $f_{Z|X,Y}(z|x,y)$. This is given by the formula:\n$$ f_{Z|X,Y}(z|x,y) = \\frac{f_{X,Y,Z}(x,y,z)}{f_{X,Y}(x,y)} $$\nThis is defined for values of $(x,y)$ where $f_{X,Y}(x,y) > 0$. The problem specifies that $x>0, y>0, x+y<1$, which is inside the support region $S$, so $f_{X,Y}(x,y) = 6(1-x-y) \\neq 0$.\n\nThe conditional support for $z$, given $x$ and $y$, is $0 \\le z \\le 1-x-y$. Within this range of $z$, we have $f_{X,Y,Z}(x,y,z) = 6$. Therefore, for $0 \\le z \\le 1-x-y$:\n$$ f_{Z|X,Y}(z|x,y) = \\frac{6}{6(1-x-y)} = \\frac{1}{1-x-y} $$\nFor values of $z$ outside this range, the conditional PDF is 0. This conditional distribution is a uniform distribution on the interval $[0, 1-x-y]$.\n\nThe problem asks for the value of the conditional PDF for outcomes within its valid range. This value is the constant $\\frac{1}{1-x-y}$.",
