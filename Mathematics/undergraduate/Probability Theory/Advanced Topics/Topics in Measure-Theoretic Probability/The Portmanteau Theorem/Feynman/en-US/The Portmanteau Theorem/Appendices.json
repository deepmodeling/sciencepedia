A common misconception is that convergence in distribution implies the convergence of moments, such as the mean.

The sequence of random variables $\\{X_n\\}$ does not converge in distribution.\n\nE. $X_n$ converges in distribution to a point mass at 0, because the expected value of $X_n$ converges to 0.",
            "solution": "To determine the limiting behavior of the sequence of random variables $\\{X_n\\}$, we will use the definition of convergence in distribution (also known as weak convergence). A sequence of random variables $X_n$ converges in distribution to a random variable $X$, denoted $X_n \\xrightarrow{d} X$, if the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of $X_n$, $F_{X_n}(x)$, converges to the CDF of $X$, $F_X(x)$, at every point $x$ where $F_X(x)$ is continuous.\n\nFirst, let's form an intuition about the limit. As $n \\to \\infty$, the probability that $X_n = 1/n$ approaches 1, while the value $1/n$ approaches 0. The probability that $X_n = n$ approaches 0. This suggests that the entire probability mass is concentrating at the point 0. So, we propose that the limiting random variable $X$ is a point mass at 0, meaning $P(X=0)=1$.\n\nThe CDF of the proposed limiting random variable $X$ is:\n$$\nF_X(x) = P(X \\le x) =\n\\begin{cases}\n0 & \\text{if } x < 0 \\\\\n1 & \\text{if } x \\ge 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis CDF, $F_X(x)$, is continuous for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ except at the point $x=0$, where it has a jump discontinuity. According to the definition of convergence in distribution, we need to check if $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} F_{X_n}(x) = F_X(x)$ for all $x \\neq 0$.\n\nNext, let's find the CDF of $X_n$. Since $X_n$ can only take values $1/n$ and $n$, its CDF, $F_{X_n}(x) = P(X_n \\le x)$, is a step function:\n$$\nF_{X_n}(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\n0 & \\text{if } x < 1/n \\\\\n1 - 1/n & \\text{if } 1/n \\le x < n \\\\\n1 & \\text{if } x \\ge n\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nNow, we analyze the limit of $F_{X_n}(x)$ as $n \\to \\infty$ for all $x \\neq 0$.\n\nCase 1: $x < 0$.\nFor any $n \\geq 1$, we have $1/n > 0 > x$. Therefore, for any $x < 0$, $F_{X_n}(x) = 0$ for all $n$.\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} F_{X_n}(x) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} 0 = 0 $$\nThis matches $F_X(x)$ for $x < 0$.\n\nCase 2: $x > 0$.\nFor any given $x > 0$, we can choose an integer $N$ large enough such that for all $n > N$, we have $1/n < x$. Specifically, this holds for all $n > 1/x$. Also, for $n > x$, we have $x < n$. Thus, for any $n > \\max(x, 1/x)$, the inequality $1/n \\le x < n$ is satisfied.\nFor such large $n$, the CDF of $X_n$ at point $x$ is $F_{X_n}(x) = 1 - 1/n$.\nTaking the limit as $n \\to \\infty$:\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} F_{X_n}(x) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} (1 - 1/n) = 1 $$\nThis matches $F_X(x)$ for $x > 0$.\n\nSince $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} F_{X_n}(x) = F_X(x)$ for all continuity points of $F_X$ (i.e., for all $x \\neq 0$), we conclude that $X_n$ converges in distribution to a point mass at 0. This means statement B is correct.\n\nNow let's evaluate the other options to be certain.\nA. The limit is a point mass, not a continuous distribution like the normal distribution. So, A is incorrect.\nC. The limit is a point mass at 0, not at 1. So, C is incorrect.\nD. We have just shown that the sequence does converge in distribution. So, D is incorrect.\nE. This statement claims that the convergence is due to the expectation of $X_n$ converging to 0. Let's calculate the expectation of $X_n$:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[X_n] = \\sum_{k} k \\cdot P(X_n=k) = \\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right) P\\left(X_n = \\frac{1}{n}\\right) + (n) P(X_n = n) $$\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[X_n] = \\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right) \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{n}\\right) + (n) \\left(\\frac{1}{n}\\right) = \\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{1}{n^2} + 1 $$\nNow we take the limit of the expectation:\n$$ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\mathbb{E}[X_n] = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{1}{n} - \\frac{1}{n^2}\\right) = 1 + 0 - 0 = 1 $$\nThe expectation of $X_n$ converges to 1, not 0. Therefore, the reasoning provided in statement E is false. An accurate statement must have correct reasoning. Even though the first part of the statement (\"$X_n$ converges in distribution to a point mass at 0\") is true, the overall statement is not accurate because the justification is incorrect. This example famously illustrates that convergence in distribution does not imply convergence of moments (in this case, the mean).\n\nThus, statement B is the only accurate description of the limiting behavior.",
