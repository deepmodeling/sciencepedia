Nodes are located at grid points $(i/n_x, j/n_y)$ for integers $i = 0,\\dots,n_x$ and $j = 0,\\dots,n_y$. An optional interior jitter amplitude $\\epsilon$ can be applied to move interior nodes by a small random displacement while keeping boundary nodes fixed.\n2. Define the six nearest-neighbor reference bond vectors for the triangular lattice:\n   - $\\mathbf{a}_1 = [1,0]$, $\\mathbf{a}_2 = [\\tfrac{1}{2}, \\tfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}]$, $\\mathbf{a}_3 = [-\\tfrac{1}{2}, \\tfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}]$, $\\mathbf{a}_4 = [-1,0]$, $\\mathbf{a}_5 = [-\\tfrac{1}{2}, -\\tfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}]$, $\\mathbf{a}_6 = [\\tfrac{1}{2}, -\\tfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}]$.\n3.

            "solution": "This problem requires performing a numerical patch test to verify the consistency of a Cauchy-Born-based Quasi-Continuum (QC) formulation. A patch test is a fundamental benchmark in computational mechanics that ensures a method can exactly reproduce a state of constant strain (and stress) when appropriate boundary conditions are applied. For an interior node in a finite element mesh, this consistency requires the net internal force (residual) to be zero. Any non-zero result should be on the order of machine precision.\n\n**1. Atomistic-to-Continuum Stress Calculation**\nThe core of the model is the Cauchy-Born (CB) rule, which connects the atomistic potential to the continuum stress. For a uniform deformation gradient $\\mathbf{F}$, a reference bond vector $\\mathbf{a}_m$ in the crystal lattice deforms to $\\mathbf{r}_m = \\mathbf{F}\\mathbf{a}_m$.

Its formula, as given in the problem, is the sum of contributions from all nearest-neighbor bonds:\n$$ \\mathbf{P}(\\mathbf{F}) = \\sum_{m=1}^{6} \\frac{\\partial \\phi(r_m)}{\\partial \\mathbf{F}} = \\sum_{m=1}^{6} k (r_m - r_0) \\frac{\\mathbf{r}_m \\mathbf{a}_m^\\top}{r_m} $$\nFor any constant $\\mathbf{F}$, this formula yields a constant stress tensor $\\mathbf{P}$ throughout the material.\n\n**2. Nodal Force Assembly from Continuum Stress**\nThe principle of virtual work connects the continuum stress to the discrete nodal forces (residuals). The internal force on node $i$, $\\mathbf{f}_i$, is the area integral of the stress acting on the gradient of its shape function, $N_i$:\n$$ \\mathbf{f}_i = \\int_{\\Omega} \\mathbf{P}(\\mathbf{F}) \\nabla N_i(\\mathbf{X}) \\, dA $$\nIn a finite element discretization with linear triangles, this integral is a sum over all elements $e$ adjacent to node $i$. Since $\\mathbf{P}$ is constant and the shape function gradient $\\nabla N_i$ is constant within each element, the integral simplifies to:\n$$ \\mathbf{f}_i = \\sum_{e \\in \\text{supp}(N_i)} A_e \\, \\mathbf{P} \\, (\\nabla N_i)|_e $$\nwhere $A_e$ is the area of element $e$.\n\n**3. The Patch Test Condition**\nFor any interior node $i$, the sum of the area-weighted gradients of its shape function over all adjacent elements is mathematically zero. This is a fundamental property of finite element shape functions:\n$$ \\sum_{e \\in \\text{supp}(N_i)} A_e (\\nabla N_i)|_e = \\mathbf{0} $$\nTherefore, the total internal residual force $\\mathbf{f}_i$ for any interior node must be zero, regardless of the constant stress state $\\mathbf{P}$ or the specific mesh geometry (including jitter). The provided code implements this procedure to numerically verify this property. It generates the mesh, computes the constant stress $\\mathbf{P}$ for a given $\\mathbf{F}$, assembles the nodal forces for all interior nodes, and calculates the total residual norm, which is then compared against a numerical tolerance.",
