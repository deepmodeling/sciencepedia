We perform a change of variables to $\\tau = t-s$.\n$$ I(t) = \\int_{0}^{t} K(\\tau)\\,v(t-\\tau)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\tau $$\nThe assumption of time-scale separation ($\\tau_{b} \\ll \\tau_{s}$) means that the memory kernel $K(\\tau)$ decays to zero for $\\tau \\gg \\tau_{b}$, while the velocity $v(t-\\tau)$ changes little over this short interval.

We define the effective friction coefficient $\\zeta$ as this integral:\n$$ \\zeta \\equiv \\int_{0}^{\\infty} K(\\tau)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\tau $$\nThe memory term thus becomes $I(t) \\approx \\zeta v(t)$.
