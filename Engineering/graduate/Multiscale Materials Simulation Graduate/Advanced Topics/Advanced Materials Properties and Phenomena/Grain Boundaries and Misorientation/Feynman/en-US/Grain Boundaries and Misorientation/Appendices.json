The use of rotation matrices from the Special Orthogonal Group $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$ to represent crystal orientations is a fundamental concept. The definition of misorientation as the angle of the relative rotation between two orientations is also standard.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. The inputs ($R_1$, $R_2$, $\\alpha$) are clearly defined. The requested output ($\\theta$) is uniquely determinable from the inputs via established mathematical procedures.

The matrices $R_1$ and $R_2$ are proper rotation matrices. A quick verification shows that $R_1^T R_1 = I$ and $\\det(R_1) = 1$. Similarly, $R_2$ is the standard matrix for a rotation about the $z$-axis, which is also a proper rotation matrix. The data is self-consistent.\n5.  **Realistic and Feasible**: The orientations described are simple rotations about the $z$-axis and are physically plausible.\n6.  **No other flaws detected**: The problem is not trivial, metaphorical, or outside the scope of scientific verification.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem asks for the misorientation angle $\\theta$ between two crystal grains whose orientations are given by the rotation matrices $R_1$ and $R_2$. The relative rotation matrix, $R_{\\Delta}$, maps the orientation of grain $1$ to that of grain $2$. This relationship can be expressed as:\n$$\nR_2 = R_{\\Delta} R_1\n$$\nTo find $R_{\\Delta}$, we can right-multiply by the inverse of $R_1$:\n$$\nR_{\\Delta} = R_2 R_1^{-1}\n$$\nFor any matrix in $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$, the inverse is equal to its transpose. Thus, $R_1^{-1} = R_1^T$. The expression for $R_{\\Delta}$ becomes:\n$$\nR_{\\Delta} = R_2 R_1^T\n$$\nFirst, we compute the transpose of $R_1$:\n$$\nR_1 = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & \\phantom{-}0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\phantom{-}0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix} \\implies R_1^T = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n-1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\phantom{-}0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we perform the matrix multiplication $R_{\\Delta} = R_2 R_1^T$:\n$$\nR_{\\Delta} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\cos\\alpha & -\\sin\\alpha & 0 \\\\\n\\sin\\alpha & \\phantom{-}\\cos\\alpha & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\phantom{-}0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n-1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\phantom{-}0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nR_{\\Delta} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n(\\cos\\alpha)(0) + (-\\sin\\alpha)(-1) + (0)(0) & (\\cos\\alpha)(1) + (-\\sin\\alpha)(0) + (0)(0) & (\\cos\\alpha)(0) + (-\\sin\\alpha)(0) + (0)(1) \\\\\n(\\sin\\alpha)(0) + (\\cos\\alpha)(-1) + (0)(0) & (\\sin\\alpha)(1) + (\\cos\\alpha)(0) + (0)(0) & (\\sin\\alpha)(0) + (\\cos\\alpha)(0) + (0)(1) \\\\\n(0)(0) + (0)(-1) + (1)(0) & (0)(1) + (0)(0) + (1)(0) & (0)(0) + (0)(0) + (1)(1)\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nR_{\\Delta} = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\sin\\alpha & \\cos\\alpha & 0 \\\\\n-\\cos\\alpha & \\sin\\alpha & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe misorientation angle $\\theta$ is the principal angle of rotation for the matrix $R_{\\Delta}$. For any rotation matrix $R$, its trace is related to its rotation angle $\\theta$ by the formula:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Tr}(R) = 1 + 2\\cos\\theta\n$$\nWe calculate the trace of our misorientation matrix $R_{\\Delta}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Tr}(R_{\\Delta}) = \\sin\\alpha + \\sin\\alpha + 1 = 1 + 2\\sin\\alpha\n$$\nEquating the two expressions for the trace, we get:\n$$\n1 + 2\\cos\\theta = 1 + 2\\sin\\alpha\n$$\n$$\n\\cos\\theta = \\sin\\alpha\n$$\nWe are given that $\\alpha = 20^{\\circ}$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\cos\\theta = \\sin(20^{\\circ})\n$$\nUsing the trigonometric identity $\\sin(x) = \\cos(90^{\\circ} - x)$, we can rewrite the equation as:\n$$\n\\cos\\theta = \\cos(90^{\\circ} - 20^{\\circ})\n$$\n$$\n\\cos\\theta = \\cos(70^{\\circ})\n$$\nThe principal misorientation angle $\\theta$ is defined in the range $[0^{\\circ}, 180^{\\circ}]$ (or $[0, \\pi]$ radians). Within this interval, the arccosine function has a unique output. Therefore, we can conclude:\n$$\n\\theta = 70^{\\circ}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The exact value of $70$ can be written as $70.00$ to satisfy this requirement.\n\nThis result can be interpreted physically. $R_1$ represents a rotation of $90^{\\circ}$ about the $z$-axis. $R_2$ represents a rotation of $\\alpha=20^{\\circ}$ about the same $z$-axis. The relative rotation is a rotation about the $z$-axis by an angle of $90^{\\circ} - 20^{\\circ} = 70^{\\circ}$ (or $20^{\\circ} - 90^{\\circ} = -70^{\\circ}$). The principal angle is the magnitude of this rotation in the range $[0^{\\circ}, 180^{\\circ}]$, which is $70^{\\circ}$. Our calculation confirms this intuition.\n\nFinal Answer Calculation:\n$\\theta = 70^{\\circ}$.\nTo four significant figures, the answer is $70.00$.",

It describes the classical Read-Shockley model for low-angle grain boundaries, a fundamental concept in materials science.\n\nFirst, we determine the relationship between the dislocation spacing $D$, the Burgers vector magnitude $b$, and the small misorientation angle $\\theta$. A symmetric tilt boundary can be visualized as two perfect crystal lattices rotated by an angle $\\theta$ relative to a common axis. The boundary is composed of an array of edge dislocations that accommodate this mismatch.\n\nConsider a segment of the grain boundary of length $L$. The number of dislocations along this segment is $N = L/D$. The crystallographic mismatch over this length results in a horizontal displacement given by $L \\tan(\\theta/2) \\approx L(\\theta/2)$ on each side, for a total gap of $2 L (\\theta/2) = L\\theta$ that must be filled by the extra atomic planes of the dislocations. This total displacement is equal to the sum of the Burgers vectors of the $N$ dislocations, which is $N b$.\nEquating these quantities gives:\n$$ N b = L \\theta $$\nSubstituting $N = L/D$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{L}{D}\\right) b = L \\theta $$\nDividing by $L$ (which is non-zero), we find the geometric relation:\n$$ \\frac{b}{D} = \\theta $$\nTherefore, the dislocation spacing $D$ is given by:\n$$ D = \\frac{b}{\\theta} $$\nIt is crucial that the angle $\\theta$ in this expression is in radians.\n\nNext, we derive the grain boundary excess energy per unit area, $\\gamma(\\theta)$, for small $\\theta$. The energy of the grain boundary is the sum of the energies of the dislocations it contains. The energy per unit area of the boundary is the energy per unit length of a single dislocation, $E_L$, divided by the spacing $D$ between dislocations:\n$$ \\gamma = \\frac{E_L}{D} $$\nThe energy per unit length of an isolated edge dislocation is given by linear elasticity theory as:\n$$ E_{L, \\text{iso}} = \\frac{G b^2}{4\\pi(1-\\nu)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{r_c}\\right) $$\nwhere $G$ is the shear modulus, $\\nu$ is Poisson's ratio, $r_c$ is the dislocation core radius (an inner cutoff of the elastic field, typically on the order of $b$), and $R$ is an outer cutoff radius, representing the size of the crystal.\n\nIn a periodic array, the long-range stress fields of the dislocations screen each other. The effective range of the stress field of a given dislocation is limited by its neighbors. Thus, the outer cutoff radius $R$ can be approximated by the dislocation spacing $D$. The energy per unit length of a dislocation in the array is then:\n$$ E_L \\approx \\frac{G b^2}{4\\pi(1-\\nu)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{D}{r_c}\\right) $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\gamma$:\n$$ \\gamma(D) = \\frac{1}{D} \\left[ \\frac{G b^2}{4\\pi(1-\\nu)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{D}{r_c}\\right) \\right] $$\nNow, we express $\\gamma$ as a function of $\\theta$ by substituting $D = b/\\theta$:\n$$ \\gamma(\\theta) = \\frac{\\theta}{b} \\left[ \\frac{G b^2}{4\\pi(1-\\nu)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{b/\\theta}{r_c}\\right) \\right] $$\nSimplifying and rearranging terms:\n$$ \\gamma(\\theta) = \\left( \\frac{G b}{4\\pi(1-\\nu)} \\right) \\theta \\ln\\left(\\frac{b}{r_c \\theta}\\right) $$\nUsing the property of logarithms, $\\ln(x/y) = \\ln(x) - \\ln(y)$:\n$$ \\gamma(\\theta) = \\left( \\frac{G b}{4\\pi(1-\\nu)} \\right) \\theta \\left( \\ln\\left(\\frac{b}{r_c}\\right) - \\ln(\\theta) \\right) $$\nThis expression matches the required form $\\gamma(\\theta) = E_0 \\theta (A - \\ln \\theta)$, where the constants are defined as:\n$$ E_0 = \\frac{G b}{4\\pi(1-\\nu)} $$\n$$ A = \\ln\\left(\\frac{b}{r_c}\\right) $$\n$E_0$ encapsulates the elastic properties of the material and has units of energy per area. $A$ is a dimensionless constant related to the non-elastic energy of the dislocation core.
