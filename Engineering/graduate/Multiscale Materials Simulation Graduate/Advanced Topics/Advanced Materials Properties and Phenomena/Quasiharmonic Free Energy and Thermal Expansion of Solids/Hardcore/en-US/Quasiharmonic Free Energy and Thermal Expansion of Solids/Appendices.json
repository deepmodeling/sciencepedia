I will proceed with the full solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Expression for $\\alpha$\n\nThe volumetric thermal expansion coefficient, $\\alpha$, is defined as:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{1}{V}\\left(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial T}\\right)_{P} $$\nTo evaluate the partial derivative at constant pressure, we employ the cyclic relation for partial derivatives (also known as the triple product rule) involving the variables $P$, $V$, and $T$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial T}\\right)_{P} \\left(\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial P}\\right)_{V} \\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial V}\\right)_{T} = -1 $$\nRearranging this identity to solve for $\\left(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial T}\\right)_{P}$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial T}\\right)_{P} = -\\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial P}\\right)_{V} \\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial V}\\right)_{T}} = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial T}\\right)_V \\left(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial P}\\right)_T $$\nSubstituting this back into the definition of $\\alpha$:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{1}{V} \\left[ -\\left(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial P}\\right)_{T} \\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial T}\\right)_{V} \\right] $$\nThe isothermal bulk modulus, $B_{T}$, is defined as $B_{T} = -V\\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial V}\\right)_{T}$. We can invert this to find the isothermal compressibility, $\\kappa_T$, or directly rearrange for the partial derivative:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial P}\\right)_{T} = -\\frac{V}{B_{T}} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\alpha$:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{1}{V} \\left[ - \\left(-\\frac{V}{B_{T}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial T}\\right)_{V} \\right] = \\frac{1}{B_{T}}\\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial T}\\right)_{V} $$\nThis is a general thermodynamic relationship. Now, we must relate $\\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial T}\\right)_{V}$ to the Grüneisen parameter within the QHA framework. In this model, the pressure $P$ is the sum of a static pressure at $0\\,$K, $P_0(V)$, and a thermal pressure from lattice vibrations, $P_{th}(V, T)$.\n$$ P(V, T) = P_0(V) + P_{th}(V, T) $$\nThe derivative with respect to temperature at constant volume is then:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial T}\\right)_{V} = \\left(\\frac{\\partial P_{th}}{\\partial T}\\right)_{V} $$\nThe thermal pressure $P_{th}$ is fundamentally related to the vibrational internal energy $U_{vib}$ and the Grüneisen parameter $\\gamma$ through the Mie-Grüneisen equation of state:\n$$ P_{th}(V, T) = \\frac{\\gamma U_{vib}(V, T)}{V} $$\nHere, $\\gamma$ is taken as a single effective parameter, assumed to be independent of temperature and vibrational mode, which is a common simplification in this context.

The numerical value is $37.415081781$. Rounding to four significant figures gives $37.42$.\nThus, $\\alpha = 37.42 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ K}^{-1}$. The requested plain number is $37.42$.",

Calculating a derivative with respect to temperature at constant pressure can be cumbersome. It is more convenient to transform this derivative using a standard thermodynamic identity derived from the cyclic relation for variables $p,V,T$: $(\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial T})_p (\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial p})_V (\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial V})_T = -1$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for a correct algorithmic procedure to compute the equilibrium volume as a function of temperature, $V(T)$, for a crystal at zero external pressure, $P_{\\mathrm{ext}}=0$, using the quasiharmonic approximation (QHA).\n\nThe fundamental thermodynamic principle is that at constant temperature $T$ and external pressure $P_{\\mathrm{ext}}$, the system's equilibrium volume $V$ is the one that minimizes the Gibbs free energy, $G(T, P_{\\mathrm{ext}}, V) = F(T,V) + P_{\\mathrm{ext}}V$. The condition for equilibrium is $\\left(\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial V}\\right)_{T,P_{\\mathrm{ext}}} = 0$. Given $P_{\\mathrm{ext}} = 0$, this simplifies to finding the volume that minimizes the Helmholtz free energy, $F(T,V)$. The equilibrium condition is therefore:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\partial F(T,V)}{\\partial V}\\right)_T = 0 $$\nWithin the QHA and for a wide-gap insulator where electronic excitations are negligible, the Helmholtz free energy is given by the sum of the static electronic energy $E_{\\mathrm{static}}(V)$ and the vibrational (phonon) free energy $F_{\\mathrm{ph}}(T,V)$:\n$$ F(T,V) = E_{\\mathrm{static}}(V) + F_{\\mathrm{ph}}(T,V) $$\nThe vibrational free energy is calculated from the volume-dependent phonon frequencies $\\omega_{s\\mathbf{q}}(V)$:\n$$ F_{\\mathrm{ph}}(T,V) = k_B T \\sum_{s,\\mathbf{q}} \\ln\\left[2 \\sinh\\left(\\frac{\\hbar \\omega_{s\\mathbf{q}}(V)}{2 k_B T}\\right)\\right] $$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, and the sum runs over all phonon modes (branch $s$, wavevector $\\mathbf{q}$).\n\nThe core of the QHA is that $F_{\\mathrm{ph}}$ depends on volume, giving rise to a vibrational pressure term that drives thermal expansion. The equilibrium condition can be expressed in two equivalent forms:\n1.  **Energy Minimization**: Finding the volume $V(T)$ that minimizes $F(T,V)$ for a given $T$.\n    $$ V(T) = \\underset{V}{\\mathrm{arg\\,min}} \\left[ E_{\\mathrm{static}}(V) + F_{\\mathrm{ph}}(T,V) \\right] $$\n2.  **Pressure Balance**: The internal pressure is $P_{\\mathrm{int}}(T,V) = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial F(T,V)}{\\partial V}\\right)_T$. Equilibrium at $P_{\\mathrm{ext}}=0$ requires $P_{\\mathrm{int}}(T,V) = 0$. This pressure can be decomposed into a static part and a vibrational part:\n    $$ P_{\\mathrm{int}}(T,V) = -\\frac{dE_{\\mathrm{static}}(V)}{dV} - \\left(\\frac{\\partial F_{\\mathrm{ph}}(T,V)}{\\partial V}\\right)_T = P_{\\mathrm{static}}(V) + P_{\\mathrm{vib}}(T,V) $$\n    The equilibrium condition is to solve $P_{\\mathrm{static}}(V) + P_{\\mathrm{vib}}(T,V) = 0$ for $V$ at each $T$.\n\nBoth approaches require continuous and differentiable functions of $V$. Since the input data, $\\{E_{\\mathrm{static}}(V_i)\\}$ and $\\{\\omega_{s\\mathbf{q}}(V_i)\\}$, are provided only at a discrete set of volumes $\\{V_i\\}$, any valid numerical procedure must employ fitting and/or interpolation to construct these continuous functions.\n\nWith this framework, we now evaluate each option.\n\n**Option A:** This procedure proposes to:\n1.  Fit $\\{E_{\\mathrm{static}}(V_i)\\}$ to a smooth equation of state (EOS) to get $E_{\\mathrm{static}}^{\\mathrm{EOS}}(V)$. This is a standard and robust method to obtain a differentiable function for the static energy.\n2.  For a given $T$, calculate $F_{\\mathrm{ph}}(T,V_i)$ at each discrete volume $V_i$.\n3.  Interpolate these values $\\{(V_i,F_{\\mathrm{ph}}(T,V_i))\\}$ to get a continuous function $F_{\\mathrm{ph}}^{\\mathrm{interp}}(T,V)$. A shape-preserving spline is an excellent choice to avoid unphysical oscillations.\n4.  At each $T$, find $V(T)$ by minimizing the total Helmholtz free energy $F(T,V)=E_{\\mathrm{static}}^{\\mathrm{EOS}}(V)+F_{\\mathrm{ph}}^{\\mathrm{interp}}(T,V)$ with respect to $V$.\n\nThis procedure perfectly matches the energy minimization approach described above. It correctly handles the discrete nature of the input data and applies the correct thermodynamic principle.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Option B:** This procedure proposes to neglect the volume dependence of the vibrational free energy for $T0$, using $F_{\\mathrm{ph}}(T,V_0)$ where $V_0$ is the equilibrium volume at $T=0\\,\\mathrm{K}$. The minimization target would be $E_{\\mathrm{static}}^{\\mathrm{EOS}}(V) + F_{\\mathrm{ph}}(T,V_0)$. Since $F_{\\mathrm{ph}}(T,V_0)$ is a constant with respect to the minimization variable $V$, this is equivalent to minimizing $E_{\\mathrm{static}}^{\\mathrm{EOS}}(V)$ alone. The minimum of the static energy function occurs at $V_0$ by definition. Therefore, this procedure would incorrectly predict $V(T) = V_0$ for all temperatures, implying zero thermal expansion. This is the harmonic approximation, not the quasiharmonic approximation, and it fails to capture the essential physics of thermal expansion, which arises precisely from the volume dependence of $F_{\\mathrm{ph}}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option C:** This procedure describes an iterative scheme. In each step $k$, it computes $F_{\\mathrm{ph}}(T,V^{(k)})$ and then finds the next volume iterate, $V^{(k+1)}$, by minimizing $E_{\\mathrm{static}}^{\\mathrm{EOS}}(V) + F_{\\mathrm{ph}}(T,V^{(k)})$. As in option B, the term $F_{\\mathrm{ph}}(T,V^{(k)})$ is a constant with respect to the minimization variable $V$. The minimization, therefore, always yields the volume that minimizes $E_{\\mathrm{static}}^{\\mathrm{EOS}}(V)$, which is $V_0$. The iteration would proceed as $V^{(0)} \\to V_0$, $V^{(1)} \\to V_0$, etc., and never converge to the correct temperature-dependent volume. The procedure is fundamentally flawed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option D:** This procedure suggests determining $V(T)$ by solving $\\partial E_{\\mathrm{static}}/\\partial V=0$. This is the condition for mechanical equilibrium at $T=0\\,\\mathrm{K}$, not for any finite temperature $T0$. The solution to this equation is the zero-temperature equilibrium volume, $V_0$, independent of $T$. The assertion that \"the vibrational contribution does not enter the mechanical equilibrium condition\" is false and contradicts the central premise of the quasiharmonic approximation. The derivative $\\partial F_{\\mathrm{ph}}/\\partial V$ (the negative of the vibrational pressure) is the very term that drives thermal expansion.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option E:** This procedure proposes to:\n1.  Obtain the static pressure $P_{\\mathrm{static}}(V) = -\\partial E_{\\mathrm{static}}^{\\mathrm{EOS}}/\\partial V$ from an EOS fit. This is a standard step.\n2.  Construct an interpolant $F_{\\mathrm{ph}}^{\\mathrm{interp}}(T,V)$ and compute the vibrational pressure $P_{\\mathrm{vib}}(T,V) = -\\partial F_{\\mathrm{ph}}^{\\mathrm{interp}}(T,V)/\\partial V$. This requires a differentiable interpolant, which is a standard numerical technique.\n3.  Solve the equation $P_{\\mathrm{static}}(V) + P_{\\mathrm{vib}}(T,V) - P_{\\mathrm{ext}} = 0$ for $V$ at each $T$, with $P_{\\mathrm{ext}}=0$.\n\nThis procedure is a direct implementation of the pressure balance approach described in the initial analysis. It is thermodynamically equivalent to the energy minimization approach in Option A. Finding the root of the total pressure is a robust and common way to find the equilibrium volume.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nIn summary, options A and E describe two equivalent and correct implementations of the quasiharmonic approximation to calculate the equilibrium volume as a function of temperature.",
