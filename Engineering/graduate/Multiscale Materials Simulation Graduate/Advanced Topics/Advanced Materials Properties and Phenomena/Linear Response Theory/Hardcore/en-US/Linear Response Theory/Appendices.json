            "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and complete. It describes a standard physical model, a damped harmonic oscillator in contact with a thermal bath, and asks for a derivation of the displacement power spectral density using the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem. This is a canonical problem in statistical mechanics. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for two main steps: first, to derive the frequency-domain susceptibility $\\chi_{xx}(\\omega)$, and second, to use this susceptibility within the framework of the classical Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT) to find the two-sided power spectral density (PSD) of displacement, $S_{xx}(\\omega)$.\n\nFirst, we derive the susceptibility $\\chi_{xx}(\\omega)$. The dynamics of the coarse-grained degree of freedom $x(t)$ are described by Newton's second law for a damped harmonic oscillator subjected to an external force $f_{\\mathrm{ext}}(t)$. The equation of motion is:\n$$ m \\frac{d^2 x(t)}{dt^2} + m\\gamma \\frac{dx(t)}{dt} + m\\omega_0^2 x(t) = f_{\\mathrm{ext}}(t) $$\nHere, $m$ is the effective mass, $m\\gamma$ is the damping coefficient (where $\\gamma$ is the damping rate), and $m\\omega_0^2$ is the spring constant (where $\\omega_0$ is the natural angular frequency of the oscillator).\n\nTo find the frequency-domain response, we apply the two-sided Fourier transform to this equation. The problem specifies the convention $X(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\mathrm{d}t \\,\\exp(i \\omega t)\\, x(t)$.

Therefore, by solving for the ratio $\\frac{X(\\omega)}{F_{\\mathrm{ext}}(\\omega)}$, we obtain the expression for the susceptibility:\n$$ \\chi_{xx}(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{m(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 - i\\gamma\\omega)} $$\nThis completes the first part of the derivation.\n\nNext, we use the classical Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem (FDT) to find the power spectral density $S_{xx}(\\omega)$. The FDT relates the spectrum of spontaneous equilibrium fluctuations of an observable to the dissipative part of its response to a small external perturbation. For a system at temperature $T$, the classical FDT, consistent with the two-sided PSD definition $S_{xx}(\\omega) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\mathrm{d}t \\,\\exp(i \\omega t)\\, \\langle x(t) x(0) \\rangle$, is given by:\n$$ S_{xx}(\\omega) = \\frac{2 k_B T}{\\omega} \\mathrm{Im}[\\chi_{xx}(\\omega)] $$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $\\mathrm{Im}[\\chi_{xx}(\\omega)]$ is the imaginary part of the susceptibility, which quantifies the energy dissipated by the system.\n\nTo use this theorem, we must first calculate $\\mathrm{Im}[\\chi_{xx}(\\omega)]$. We can isolate the imaginary part by multiplying the numerator and denominator of our expression for $\\chi_{xx}(\\omega)$ by the complex conjugate of the denominator:\n$$ \\chi_{xx}(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{m(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 - i\\gamma\\omega)} \\times \\frac{(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 + i\\gamma\\omega)}{(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 + i\\gamma\\omega)} $$\n$$ \\chi_{xx}(\\omega) = \\frac{\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 + i\\gamma\\omega}{m\\left[(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2)^2 + (-\\gamma\\omega)^2\\right]} = \\frac{\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 + i\\gamma\\omega}{m\\left[(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2)^2 + \\gamma^2\\omega^2\\right]} $$\nSeparating this into real and imaginary parts:\n$$ \\chi_{xx}(\\omega) = \\frac{\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2}{m\\left[(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2)^2 + \\gamma^2\\omega^2\\right]} + i \\frac{\\gamma\\omega}{m\\left[(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2)^2 + \\gamma^2\\omega^2\\right]} $$\nThe imaginary part is therefore:\n$$ \\mathrm{Im}[\\chi_{xx}(\\omega)] = \\frac{\\gamma\\omega}{m\\left[(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2)^2 + \\gamma^2\\omega^2\\right]} $$\nNow, we substitute this expression into the FDT formula for $S_{xx}(\\omega)$:\n$$ S_{xx}(\\omega) = \\frac{2 k_B T}{\\omega} \\left( \\frac{\\gamma\\omega}{m\\left[(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2)^2 + \\gamma^2\\omega^2\\right]} \\right) $$\nThe factor of $\\omega$ in the numerator and denominator cancels out, leading to the final, simplified expression for the two-sided displacement power spectral density:\n$$ S_{xx}(\\omega) = \\frac{2 k_B T \\gamma}{m\\left[(\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2)^2 + \\gamma^2\\omega^2\\right]} $$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for $S_{xx}(\\omega)$ in terms of the given parameters.

Express your final answer as a row matrix with entries $\\alpha$ and $F/\\omega_p^2$. No numerical rounding is required, and do not include units in the final answer.",
            "solution": "The problem requires determining the values of the parameters $\\alpha$ and $F/\\omega_p^2$ for a proposed dielectric susceptibility model\n$$\n\\chi(\\omega) = \\frac{F}{\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 - i \\gamma \\omega} + i \\alpha \\omega\n$$\nsuch that the model is consistent with two fundamental principles of linear response theory: causality and the f-sum rule.\n\nFirst, we assess the condition of causality, which is linked to the Kramers-Kronig (KK) relations. The principle of causality dictates that the response of the system at time $t$, represented by the susceptibility in the time domain $\\chi(t)$, cannot depend on the applied field at future times $t'  t$. This implies that $\\chi(t)$ must be zero for all $t  0$. A direct consequence of this time-domain condition is that its Fourier transform, the frequency-domain susceptibility $\\chi(\\omega)$, must be an analytic function in the upper half of the complex frequency plane (Im($\\omega$) $ 0$).\n\nLet's analyze the analyticity of the proposed $\\chi(\\omega)$. The function consists of two terms.\nThe first term is the Lorentz oscillator model, $\\chi_L(\\omega) = \\frac{F}{\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 - i \\gamma \\omega}$. The poles of this function are the roots of the denominator, $\\omega^2 + i\\gamma\\omega - \\omega_0^2 = 0$. Using the quadratic formula, the poles are:\n$$\n\\omega_{poles} = \\frac{-i\\gamma \\pm \\sqrt{(i\\gamma)^2 - 4(1)(-\\omega_0^2)}}{2} = \\frac{-i\\gamma \\pm \\sqrt{4\\omega_0^2 - \\gamma^2}}{2}\n$$\nSince the problem states that $\\gamma  0$, the imaginary part of both poles is $-i\\gamma/2$, which is negative. Therefore, both poles lie in the lower half of the complex $\\omega$-plane. The Lorentz term $\\chi_L(\\omega)$ is thus analytic in the upper half-plane, consistent with causality.\n\nThe second term is $\\chi_A(\\omega) = i \\alpha \\omega$. This is a linear function of $\\omega$ and is analytic everywhere in the finite complex plane. Therefore, the full susceptibility $\\chi(\\omega) = \\chi_L(\\omega) + \\chi_A(\\omega)$ is analytic in the upper half-plane for any finite real value of $\\alpha$.\n\nHowever, the derivation of the standard Kramers-Kronig relations and the physical behavior of dielectric media impose an additional constraint on the behavior of $\\chi(\\omega)$ as $|\\omega| \\to \\infty$. In any physical system with massive charge carriers, the polarization cannot follow an infinitely fast-oscillating electric field. Consequently, the polarization must vanish at infinite frequency. This implies that the dielectric function $\\varepsilon(\\omega)$ must approach the vacuum permittivity, i.e., $\\varepsilon(\\omega) \\to 1$ as $|\\omega| \\to \\infty$. Since $\\varepsilon(\\omega) = 1 + \\chi(\\omega)$, this is equivalent to the condition that $\\chi(\\omega) \\to 0$ as $|\\omega| \\to \\infty$. This condition is also a prerequisite for the applicability of Cauchy's integral theorem in the standard derivation of the KK relations.\n\nLet's examine the high-frequency limit of the proposed model:\n$$\n\\lim_{|\\omega|\\to\\infty} \\chi(\\omega) = \\lim_{|\\omega|\\to\\infty} \\left( \\frac{F}{\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 - i \\gamma \\omega} + i \\alpha \\omega \\right)\n$$\nThe first term behaves as $\\frac{F}{-\\omega^2}$, which tends to $0$. The second term, $i\\alpha\\omega$, however, diverges if $\\alpha \\neq 0$. To satisfy the physical requirement that $\\chi(\\omega) \\to 0$, we must enforce that the coefficient of the divergent term is zero. This gives our first result:\n$$\n\\alpha = 0\n$$\n\nSecond, we apply the oscillator-strength (f-sum) rule, also known as the Thomas-Reiche-Kuhn sum rule for dielectric materials. This rule relates the integral of the dissipative part of the dielectric response to the total density of electrons. The rule is given by:\n$$\n\\int_0^\\infty \\omega \\, \\text{Im}[\\varepsilon(\\omega)] \\, d\\omega = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\omega_p^2\n$$\nwhere $\\omega_p^2 = n e^2/(\\varepsilon_0 m)$ is the square of the plasma frequency. Since $\\varepsilon(\\omega) = 1 + \\chi(\\omega)$ and $\\text{Im}[1]=0$, the sum rule can be written in terms of the susceptibility:\n$$\n\\int_0^\\infty \\omega \\, \\text{Im}[\\chi(\\omega)] \\, d\\omega = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\omega_p^2\n$$\nThis sum rule is intimately connected to the high-frequency behavior of $\\chi(\\omega)$. The Kramers-Kronig relations imply a specific asymptotic form for $\\text{Re}[\\chi(\\omega)]$ if the f-sum rule is to be satisfied. For large $\\omega$, the real part of the susceptibility can be expressed as:\n$$\n\\text{Re}[\\chi(\\omega)] \\approx -\\frac{2}{\\pi\\omega^2} \\mathcal{P} \\int_0^\\infty \\omega' \\text{Im}[\\chi(\\omega')] \\, d\\omega'\n$$\nSubstituting the f-sum rule integral into this expression gives the required high-frequency behavior:\n$$\n\\text{Re}[\\chi(\\omega)] \\approx -\\frac{2}{\\pi\\omega^2} \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\omega_p^2 \\right) = -\\frac{\\omega_p^2}{\\omega^2}\n$$\nIn fact, the general high-frequency limit for any electronic system is $\\chi(\\omega) \\to -\\omega_p^2/\\omega^2$.\n\nNow we must enforce this condition on our proposed model. With $\\alpha=0$, the model is $\\chi(\\omega) = \\frac{F}{\\omega_0^2 - \\omega^2 - i \\gamma \\omega}$. Let's find its high-frequency limit:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\omega\\to\\infty} \\chi(\\omega) = \\lim_{\\omega\\to\\infty} \\frac{F}{-\\omega^2(1 - \\omega_0^2/\\omega^2 + i\\gamma/\\omega)} = -\\frac{F}{\\omega^2}\n$$\nThis expression is purely real in the limit, meaning the real part tends to $-F/\\omega^2$.\n$$\n\\text{Re}[\\chi(\\omega)] \\to -\\frac{F}{\\omega^2} \\quad \\text{as } \\omega \\to \\infty\n$$\nFor the model to be compatible with the f-sum rule, its asymptotic behavior must match the one dictated by the rule. By comparing the two expressions for the high-frequency limit of $\\text{Re}[\\chi(\\omega)]$, we get:\n$$\n-\\frac{F}{\\omega^2} = -\\frac{\\omega_p^2}{\\omega^2}\n$$\nThis implies that $F = \\omega_p^2$.\nThe problem asks for the dimensionless ratio $F/\\omega_p^2$. From our result, this ratio is:\n$$\n\\frac{F}{\\omega_p^2} = 1\n$$\nIn summary, causality and physical realism for a dielectric response function require $\\alpha=0$, and the f-sum rule requires $F/\\omega_p^2 = 1$.\n\nThe values are:\n$\\alpha = 0$\n$F/\\omega_p^2 = 1$\n\nExpressing this as a row matrix $(\\alpha, F/\\omega_p^2)$:\n$\\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}$",

The language is objective and the setup is self-contained and consistent.\n\nThe solution proceeds by addressing the three requested parts in sequence.\n\n(a) Smallest non-zero wavevector magnitude $k_{\\min}(L)$:\n\nIn a cubic simulation cell of side length $L$ with periodic boundary conditions, the allowed wavevectors $\\mathbf{k}$ form a discrete lattice in reciprocal space. These vectors are given by the expression:\n$$\n\\mathbf{k} = \\frac{2\\pi}{L}\\mathbf{n}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{n} = (n_x, n_y, n_z)$ is a vector with integer components, i.e., $n_x, n_y, n_z \\in \\mathbb{Z}$. The magnitude squared of a wavevector is:\n$$\nk^2 = |\\mathbf{k}|^2 = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 (n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2)\n$$\nThe problem asks for the smallest non-zero wavevector magnitude, denoted $k_{\\min}(L)$. A non-zero magnitude requires that $\\mathbf{n}$ is not the zero vector $(0,0,0)$. To find the minimum non-zero $k$, we must find the minimum non-zero value of the sum of squares of the integers, $n_x^2 + n_y^2 + n_z^2$. The smallest possible non-zero value for this sum is $1$, which occurs when one of the integers is $\\pm 1$ and the other two are $0$. For example, $\\mathbf{n} = (1,0,0)$ or $\\mathbf{n} = (0,-1,0)$. For any such choice, the squared sum $|\\mathbf{n}|^2 = 1$.\n\nTherefore, the minimum non-zero squared wavevector magnitude is:\n$$\nk_{\\min}^2 = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 \\times 1 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{L^2}\n$$\nTaking the square root gives the smallest non-zero wavevector magnitude:\n$$\nk_{\\min}(L) = \\frac{2\\pi}{L}\n$$\n\n(b) Slowest decay rate and correlation time $\\tau(L)$:\n\nThe problem states that a transverse hydrodynamic mode with wavevector magnitude $k$ decays in time as $\\exp(-\\nu k^2 t)$, where $\\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity. The decay rate for a given mode $k$ is therefore $\\Gamma(k) = \\nu k^2$.\n\nThe slowest non-zero decay rate corresponds to the hydrodynamic mode with the smallest non-zero wavevector magnitude, $k_{\\min}$. Substituting the expression for $k_{\\min}$ into the decay rate formula gives the slowest rate, $\\Gamma_{\\min}$:\n$$\n\\Gamma_{\\min} = \\nu k_{\\min}^2 = \\nu \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2\\nu}{L^2}\n$$\nThe correlation time $\\tau(L)$ is defined as the relaxation time of this slowest mode. The relaxation time is the reciprocal of the decay rate.

For a finite system of size $L$, the periodic boundary conditions cannot support hydrodynamic modes with wavelengths longer than $L$. This imposes a natural cutoff on the timescale of correlations. The slowest relaxing mode has a lifetime $\\tau(L)$, so correlations are effectively suppressed for times $t \\gtrsim \\tau(L)$.\n\nWe can approximate the transport coefficient measured in a finite system, $A(L)$, by truncating the Green-Kubo integral at the cutoff time $\\tau(L)$:\n$$\nA(L) \\approx \\int_{0}^{\\tau(L)} C_A(t) \\, dt\n$$\nwhere $C_A(t)$ is the corresponding time correlation function.
