It is a standard problem in polymer physics, and we may proceed with the derivation.\n\nOur goal is to derive a closed-form expression for the radius of gyration, $R_g$, of an ideal polymer chain.

The position vector $\\mathbf{r}_s$ is given by $\\mathbf{r}_s = \\sum_{i=1}^{s} \\mathbf{b}_i$, with the convention that $\\mathbf{r}_0 = \\mathbf{0}$. The difference vector $\\mathbf{r}_s - \\mathbf{r}_t$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}_s - \\mathbf{r}_t = \\sum_{i=1}^{s} \\mathbf{b}_i - \\sum_{j=1}^{t} \\mathbf{b}_j\n$$\nWithout loss of generality, let us assume $s \\ge t$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}_s - \\mathbf{r}_t = \\sum_{i=t+1}^{s} \\mathbf{b}_i\n$$\nThe squared magnitude is the dot product of this vector with itself:\n$$\n\\left| \\mathbf{r}_s - \\mathbf{r}_t \\right|^{2} = \\left( \\sum_{i=t+1}^{s} \\mathbf{b}_i \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\sum_{j=t+1}^{s} \\mathbf{b}_j \\right) = \\sum_{i=t+1}^{s} \\sum_{j=t+1}^{s} \\mathbf{b}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_j\n$$\nNow, we take the ensemble average, denoted by $\\langle \\dots \\rangle$.

It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, with a clear and solvable task. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem asks for a scaling estimate for the tube diameter $a$ in a polymer melt, based on the reptation model. We begin with the fundamental concepts provided.\n\nA long flexible polymer chain is modeled as a random walk of $N$ Kuhn steps, each of length $b$. For a sufficiently long chain ($N \\gg 1$), the mean-square end-to-end distance, according to random walk statistics, is given by:\n$$\n\\langle |\\mathbf{R}|^2 \\rangle = N b^2\n$$\n\nIn a dense melt, the motion of a given chain is constrained by entanglements with its neighbors. The reptation model posits that these constraints confine the chain to a tube-like region. The centerline of this tube is called the primitive path. This primitive path is itself a random walk, composed of $N_{pp} = N/N_e$ steps, where $N_e$ is the number of Kuhn steps in a chain segment between two consecutive entanglements.\n\nThe length of a step of the primitive path is operationally defined as the tube diameter, $a$. Since the primitive path is a random walk of $N_{pp}$ steps of length $a$, its mean-square end-to-end distance is:\n$$\n\\langle |\\mathbf{R}_{PP}|^2 \\rangle = N_{pp} a^2 = \\frac{N}{N_e} a^2\n$$\n\nA crucial aspect of this coarse-graining procedure is that the overall dimensions of the primitive path must match the overall dimensions of the original chain. Therefore, we equate the mean-square end-to-end distances of the two models:\n$$\n\\langle |\\mathbf{R}|^2 \\rangle = \\langle |\\mathbf{R}_{PP}|^2 \\rangle\n$$\n$$\nN b^2 = \\frac{N}{N_e} a^2\n$$\n\nSolving for $a^2$, we cancel the total number of steps $N$ from both sides:\n$$\na^2 = N_e b^2\n$$\nThis gives the fundamental scaling relationship for the tube diameter:\n$$\na = \\sqrt{N_e} b\n$$\n\nThis result establishes that the tube diameter is equal to the root-mean-square end-to-end distance of a subchain of length $N_e$. This aligns with the physical picture that a chain segment between entanglements determines the size of its own confinement.\n\nThe problem statement also directs us to consider the \"mean-square transverse displacement\". This provides an alternative, albeit consistent, perspective. Let us consider a subchain of $N_e$ Kuhn steps. Its mean-square end-to-end distance is $\\langle |\\mathbf{R}_{N_e}|^2 \\rangle = N_e b^2$. Let us establish an arbitrary Cartesian coordinate system. Due to the isotropy of the random walk, the mean-square components of the end-to-end vector are equal:\n$$\n\\langle R_x^2 \\rangle = \\langle R_y^2 \\rangle = \\langle R_z^2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{3} \\langle |\\mathbf{R}_{N_e}|^2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{3} N_e b^2\n$$\nIf we align the local primitive path with the $z$-axis, the displacement in the $xy$-plane is considered transverse. The mean-square transverse displacement of the end of the segment with respect to its beginning is $\\langle R_{\\perp}^2 \\rangle = \\langle R_x^2 + R_y^2 \\rangle$.\n$$\n\\langle R_{\\perp}^2 \\rangle = \\langle R_x^2 \\rangle + \\langle R_y^2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{3} N_e b^2 + \\frac{1}{3} N_e b^2 = \\frac{2}{3} N_e b^2\n$$\nThe problem states to identify $a^2$ with this quantity, \"up to an order-one prefactor\". This confirms the scaling $a^2 \\propto N_e b^2$. The derivation based on matching the overall chain dimensions yields the simplest form of this relation, with a prefactor of $1$, which we adopt for the calculation as is standard for such scaling estimates.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $a$ using the provided data:\n- Kuhn step length, $b = 1 \\,\\text{nm}$\n- Entanglement length, $N_e = 50$\n\nUsing the derived scaling relation $a = \\sqrt{N_e} b$:\n$$\na = \\sqrt{50} \\times (1 \\,\\text{nm})\n$$\n$$\na = \\sqrt{25 \\times 2} \\,\\text{nm} = 5\\sqrt{2} \\,\\text{nm}\n$$\nTo find the numerical value, we use the approximation $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.41421356...$:\n$$\na \\approx 5 \\times 1.41421356 \\,\\text{nm} \\approx 7.0710678 \\,\\text{nm}\n$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, as requested:\n$$\na \\approx 7.07 \\,\\text{nm}\n$$",
