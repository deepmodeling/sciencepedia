            "introduction": "While introductory treatments of diffusion often rely on the simplifying assumption of a constant diffusion coefficient, $D$, this is rarely true in real materials. In many systems, particularly concentrated solid solutions, the diffusivity is a strong function of the local species concentration, $c$. This practice challenges you to move beyond the linear Fickian model by analytically solving the steady-state diffusion equation for a case where $D$ depends linearly on $c$. Mastering this type of analytical solution is a crucial skill for a materials modeler, as it provides physical insight into nonlinear transport phenomena and serves as an essential benchmark for more complex numerical simulations .",

            "problem": "A one-dimensional crystalline solid of length $L$ connects two large reservoirs that maintain constant concentrations $c(0)=c_0$ and $c(L)=c_L$ of a diffusing substitutional species. The temperature is uniform, the cross-section is constant, and there are no sources or sinks within the solid. The diffusing species exhibits a concentration-dependent chemical diffusivity modeled by $D(c)=D_0\\left(1+\\alpha c\\right)$, with $D_00$ and $\\alpha$ a constant such that $1+\\alpha c0$ for all concentrations encountered between $c_0$ and $c_L$. Assume steady state is reached so that the particle flux is independent of position.\n\nStarting from the conservation of mass and the continuum definition of diffusive flux in solids, derive the steady-state one-dimensional concentration profile $c(x)$ consistent with the boundary conditions $c(0)=c_0$ and $c(L)=c_L$, and obtain an explicit expression for the constant flux $J$ through the solid. Express your final results as closed-form analytic expressions in terms of $D_0$, $\\alpha$, $c_0$, $c_L$, $L$, and $x$. No numerical rounding is required, and you should not include any units in your final expressions.",
            "solution": "The analysis of the one-dimensional steady-state diffusion problem begins with the principle of mass conservation.\n\nThe continuity equation in one dimension without internal sources or sinks is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x} = 0\n$$\nwhere $c$ is the concentration of the diffusing species and $J$ is the particle flux. The problem states that the system is at steady state, which implies that all time derivatives are zero. Therefore, $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = 0$, and the continuity equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{dJ}{dx} = 0\n$$\nIntegrating this equation with respect to position $x$ confirms the problem's statement that the flux $J$ is constant throughout the solid.\n\nThe flux $J$ is related to the concentration gradient through Fick's first law:\n$$\nJ = -D(c) \\frac{dc}{dx}\n$$\nwhere $D(c)$ is the concentration-dependent chemical diffusivity. The problem provides the specific functional form for the diffusivity:\n$$\nD(c) = D_0(1 + \\alpha c)\n$$\nwhere $D_0$ and $\\alpha$ are constants.\n\nSubstituting this expression for $D(c)$ into Fick's law yields a first-order ordinary differential equation for the concentration profile $c(x)$:\n$$\nJ = -D_0(1 + \\alpha c) \\frac{dc}{dx}\n$$\nThis equation is nonlinear due to the product of $(1+\\alpha c)$ and the derivative of $c$. To solve it, we can separate the variables:\n$$\nJ \\, dx = -D_0(1 + \\alpha c) \\, dc\n$$\nThis equation is separable, but a more elegant approach is to linearize it through a change of variables. Let us define a new variable $y(x)$ as:\n$$\ny(x) = (1 + \\alpha c(x))^2\n$$\nThe derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$ is found using the chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx}[(1 + \\alpha c(x))^2] = 2(1 + \\alpha c) \\cdot \\alpha \\frac{dc}{dx}\n$$\nFrom this, we can express the concentration gradient as:\n$$\n\\frac{dc}{dx} = \\frac{1}{2\\alpha(1 + \\alpha c)}\\frac{dy}{dx}\n$$\nWe substitute this expression for $\\frac{dc}{dx}$ back into the equation for the flux $J$:\n$$\nJ = -D_0(1 + \\alpha c) \\left( \\frac{1}{2\\alpha(1 + \\alpha c)}\\frac{dy}{dx} \\right) = -\\frac{D_0}{2\\alpha} \\frac{dy}{dx}\n$$\nThis transformation yields a linear differential equation for $y(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{2\\alpha J}{D_0}\n$$\nSince $J$, $D_0$, and $\\alpha$ are constants, the derivative $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ is also a constant. The solution for $y(x)$ is therefore a linear function of $x$. We can write the general solution as an interpolation between the boundary values. At the boundaries $x=0$ and $x=L$, the concentrations are $c(0)=c_0$ and $c(L)=c_L$. The corresponding values for $y(x)$ are:\n$$\ny(0) = (1 + \\alpha c_0)^2\n$$\n$$\ny(L) = (1 + \\alpha c_L)^2\n$$\nThe linear profile for $y(x)$ that satisfies these boundary conditions is:\n$$\ny(x) = y(0) + \\frac{y(L) - y(0)}{L} x\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $y(0)$ and $y(L)$:\n$$\ny(x) = (1 + \\alpha c_0)^2 + \\frac{(1 + \\alpha c_L)^2 - (1 + \\alpha c_0)^2}{L} x\n$$\nThis can also be written as:\n$$\ny(x) = \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{L}\\right)(1 + \\alpha c_0)^2 + \\frac{x}{L}(1 + \\alpha c_L)^2\n$$\nNow, we can solve for the concentration profile $c(x)$ by reversing the substitution $y(x)=(1+\\alpha c(x))^2$:\n$$\n1 + \\alpha c(x) = \\sqrt{y(x)}\n$$\nThe positive root is chosen because the problem specifies that $1 + \\alpha c  0$. Therefore:\n$$\nc(x) = \\frac{\\sqrt{y(x)} - 1}{\\alpha}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $y(x)$ gives the final expression for the concentration profile $c(x)$:\n$$\nc(x) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\left( \\sqrt{\\left(1 - \\frac{x}{L}\\right)(1 + \\alpha c_0)^2 + \\frac{x}{L}(1 + \\alpha c_L)^2} - 1 \\right)\n$$\nNext, we derive the expression for the constant flux $J$. From our linearized equation, we have:\n$$\nJ = -\\frac{D_0}{2\\alpha} \\frac{dy}{dx}\n$$\nThe derivative $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ is the constant slope of the linear profile of $y(x)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{y(L) - y(0)}{L} = \\frac{(1 + \\alpha c_L)^2 - (1 + \\alpha c_0)^2}{L}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the equation for $J$:\n$$\nJ = -\\frac{D_0}{2\\alpha} \\left( \\frac{(1 + \\alpha c_L)^2 - (1 + \\alpha c_0)^2}{L} \\right)\n$$\nRearranging the terms gives the final expression for the flux $J$:\n$$\nJ = \\frac{D_0}{2\\alpha L} \\left( (1 + \\alpha c_0)^2 - (1 + \\alpha c_L)^2 \\right)\n$$\nThis expression can be expanded and factored to show its connection to the average diffusivity:\n$$\nJ = \\frac{D_0}{2\\alpha L} ( (1+2\\alpha c_0 + \\alpha^2 c_0^2) - (1+2\\alpha c_L + \\alpha^2 c_L^2) ) = \\frac{D_0}{L} \\left( (c_0 - c_L) + \\frac{\\alpha}{2}(c_0^2 - c_L^2) \\right)\n$$\n$$\nJ = \\frac{D_0(c_0 - c_L)}{L} \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\alpha}{2}(c_0 + c_L) \\right)\n$$\nThe term $D_0(1 + \\frac{\\alpha}{2}(c_0 + c_L))$ can be interpreted as an effective average diffusivity for the given boundary concentrations. The derived forms for $c(x)$ and $J$ are valid for $\\alpha \\neq 0$. In the limit $\\alpha \\to 0$, these expressions correctly recover the standard results for diffusion with a constant diffusivity $D_0$: a linear concentration profile $c(x) = c_0 + (c_L - c_0)\\frac{x}{L}$ and a constant flux $J = -D_0 \\frac{c_L - c_0}{L}$.\n\nThe two required results are the concentration profile $c(x)$ and the flux $J$.",

            "problem": "You are given a physically motivated modeling task to connect atomistic hop energetics from Density Functional Theory (DFT) to macroscopic anisotropic diffusivity in a crystalline solid. Consider a dilute population of Lithium (Li) ions migrating through a periodic lattice of sites in a layered battery cathode. At the atomistic scale, hops between neighboring sites are thermally activated, and the set of allowed hop types is assumed to be limited to two crystallographic directions defined by the lattice basis: one in-plane direction, labeled $a$, and one out-of-plane direction, labeled $c$. The macroscopic goal is to compute a direction-resolved diffusivity tensor, specifically the scalar diffusivities along $a$ and $c$, and then compare their magnitudes.\n\nThe fundamental base for this task is:\n\n- The continuous-time Markov jump process for a dilute tracer on a periodic lattice, with transition rates determined by local migration barriers.\n- The Transition State Theory (TST) expression for the hop rate $k$ for a hop of activation energy $E_a$ at temperature $T$, with an attempt frequency $\\nu$: $k = \\nu \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{k_B T}\\right)$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n- The definition of direction-resolved diffusivity via the long-time limit of the mean-square displacement along a Cartesian component, consistent with the Einstein relation: for each direction $\\alpha \\in \\{a,c\\}$, the diffusivity $D_\\alpha$ is defined by $D_\\alpha = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\langle \\Delta r_\\alpha(t)^2 \\rangle}{2 t}$.\n\nThe lattice model and the dilute limit imply that hops occur as a memoryless Poisson process with independent increments.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed sound. It presents a well-posed, scientifically grounded task in computational materials physics, free of internal contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors. The provided parameters and constants are physically realistic and sufficient for deriving a unique solution.\n\nThe objective is to compute the anisotropic diffusion coefficients, $D_a$ and $D_c$, and their ratio $R = D_a/D_c$, for a dilute species migrating on a periodic lattice. The derivation connects microscopic jump parameters to the macroscopic diffusivity based on the principles of statistical mechanics.\n\nThe cornerstone of this calculation is the Einstein relation for the diffusion coefficient in a specific direction $\\alpha$:\n$$D_\\alpha = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\langle \\Delta r_\\alpha(t)^2 \\rangle}{2 t}$$\nHere, $\\langle \\Delta r_\\alpha(t)^2 \\rangle$ represents the mean-square displacement (MSD) of the diffusing particle along direction $\\alpha$ over a time interval $t$.\n\nThe displacement is the cumulative result of discrete, random hops. The problem states that these hops constitute a continuous-time Markov jump process, which for a dilute tracer on a periodic lattice simplifies to a memoryless Poisson process. A key consequence is that the MSD grows linearly with time for large $t$.\n\nThe rate of a single, specific jump event is described by Transition State Theory (TST):\n$$k'_\\alpha = \\nu \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_\\alpha}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nwhere $\\nu$ is the attempt frequency, $E_\\alpha$ is the activation energy (migration barrier) for a hop of type $\\alpha$, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe crucial modeling simplification is that hop vectors are strictly aligned along either the $a$ or $c$ directions, and that cross-coupling terms are neglected. This allows us to treat the diffusion along each direction independently. For a given direction $\\alpha \\in \\{a, c\\}$, there are $n_\\alpha$ symmetrically equivalent types of hops, each with a characteristic hop length $\\ell_\\alpha$.\n\nThe rate of growth of the MSD along direction $\\alpha$ can be expressed as the sum of contributions from all possible jump types. For a jump of type $j$ with rate $\\Gamma_j$ and displacement vector $\\vec{s}_j$, its contribution to the rate of change of the MSD along direction $\\hat{\\alpha}$ is $\\Gamma_j (\\vec{s}_j \\cdot \\hat{\\alpha})^2$.\n\nIn our model, for a given direction $\\alpha$, we have $n_\\alpha$ distinct hop possibilities. Each occurs at the rate $k'_\\alpha$. Since each of these hop vectors is strictly aligned with the direction $\\alpha$, the square of its projection onto $\\hat{\\alpha}$ is simply $\\ell_\\alpha^2$. Therefore, the total rate of MSD accumulation along direction $\\alpha$ is the sum of the contributions from these $n_\\alpha$ independent jump processes:\n$$\\frac{d\\langle \\Delta r_\\alpha^2 \\rangle}{dt} = \\sum_{j=1}^{n_\\alpha} k'_\\alpha \\ell_\\alpha^2 = n_\\alpha k'_\\alpha \\ell_\\alpha^2$$\n\nIntegrating with respect to time from $t=0$ (assuming the particle starts at the origin, so $\\langle \\Delta r_\\alpha(0)^2 \\rangle = 0$), we get the time-dependent MSD:\n$$\\langle \\Delta r_\\alpha(t)^2 \\rangle = \\left(n_\\alpha k'_\\alpha \\ell_\\alpha^2\\right) t$$\n\nSubstituting this linear-in-time MSD back into the Einstein relation yields the diffusion coefficient:\n$$D_\\alpha = \\frac{\\left(n_\\alpha k'_\\alpha \\ell_\\alpha^2\\right) t}{2 t} = \\frac{1}{2} n_\\alpha \\ell_\\alpha^2 k'_\\alpha$$\n\nFinally, by substituting the TST expression for the hop rate $k'_\\alpha$, we arrive at the complete formula for the diffusivity in direction $\\alpha$:\n$$D_\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2} n_\\alpha \\ell_\\alpha^2 \\nu \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_\\alpha}{k_B T}\\right)$$\n\nThis formula will be used to compute $D_a$ and $D_c$. For calculations, all parameters must be in a consistent set of units, specifically SI units. The hop lengths $\\ell_\\alpha$, given in Ångströms ($\\mathrm{\\AA}$), are converted to meters ($\\mathrm{m}$) using the relation $1\\,\\mathrm{\\AA} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m}$. The attempt frequency $\\nu$ is in $\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$. With these units, the resulting diffusivity $D_\\alpha$ will be in $\\mathrm{m^2/s}$. The activation energy $E_\\alpha$ is given in $\\mathrm{eV}$ and the Boltzmann constant $k_B$ in $\\mathrm{eV/K}$, ensuring the argument of the exponential function is dimensionless. The anisotropy ratio $R$ is then calculated as the dimensionless quantity $R = D_a / D_c$.",

First, we must convert the temperatures from Celsius to Kelvin:\n$$T_1 = 1100^\\circ\\text{C} + 273.15 = 1373.15 \\text{ K}$$\n$$T_2 = 1300^\\circ\\text{C} + 273.15 = 1573.15 \\text{ K}$$\n\nNow, we can write the Arrhenius relation for each data point:\n1.  $\\ln(D_1) = \\ln(D_0) - \\frac{Q}{k_B T_1}$\n2.  $\\ln(D_2) = \\ln(D_0) - \\frac{Q}{k_B T_2}$\n\nTo eliminate the unknown pre-exponential factor $D_0$, we can subtract the second equation from the first:\n$$\\ln(D_1) - \\ln(D_2) = \\left(\\ln(D_0) - \\frac{Q}{k_B T_1}\\right) - \\left(\\ln(D_0) - \\frac{Q}{k_B T_2}\\right)$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{D_1}{D_2}\\right) = \\frac{Q}{k_B T_2} - \\frac{Q}{k_B T_1}$$\n\nNow, we solve for the activation energy $Q$:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{D_1}{D_2}\\right) = \\frac{Q}{k_B}\\left(\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1}\\right)$$\n$$Q = k_B \\frac{\\ln(D_1/D_2)}{(1/T_2 - 1/T_1)}$$\n\nNext, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n$D_1 = 5.21 \\times 10^{-17} \\text{ m}^2/\\text{s}$\n$D_2 = 9.42 \\times 10^{-16} \\text{ m}^2/\\text{s}$\n$T_1 = 1373.15 \\text{ K}$\n$T_2 = 1573.15 \\text{ K}$\n$k_B = 8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/K}$\n\nFirst, calculate the logarithm term:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{D_1}{D_2}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{5.21 \\times 10^{-17}}{9.42 \\times 10^{-16}}\\right) = \\ln(0.05530785...) = -2.89512$$\n\nNext, calculate the temperature term in the denominator:\n$$\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{1573.15 \\text{ K}} - \\frac{1}{1373.15 \\text{ K}} = (6.35671 \\times 10^{-4} - 7.28253 \\times 10^{-4}) \\text{ K}^{-1} = -9.2582 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ K}^{-1}$$\n\nNow, substitute these intermediate results back into the equation for $Q$:\n$$Q = (8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/K}) \\frac{-2.89512}{-9.2582 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ K}^{-1}}$$\n$$Q = (8.617 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/K}) \\times (31270.8 \\text{ K})$$\n$$Q = 2.6947 \\text{ eV}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$Q \\approx 2.69 \\text{ eV}$$",
