Consider a straight dislocation gliding on one of the $\\{111\\}$ planes with slip direction $\\left[110\\right]$. Using only fundamental definitions of Miller indices, plane normals, and Burgers vectors in Bravais lattices, do the following:\n\n- Identify the specific member $\\left(hkl\\right)$ of the $\\{111\\}$ family whose plane contains the direction $\\left[110\\right]$ by enforcing the orthogonality condition between a plane normal and any direction lying within the plane.\n- From first principles, construct the unit slip-plane normal $\\mathbf{n}$ and the unit slip direction $\\mathbf{s}$ compatible with that plane and slip direction.\n- Define the dislocation line direction $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$ for both the pure screw character and the pure edge character using geometric relations among $\\mathbf{n}$, $\\mathbf{s}$, and $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$.\n- Finally, determine the magnitude $b$ of the Burgers vector of the shortest perfect lattice translation consistent with this slip system in an FCC crystal, and express $b$ as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $a$.\n\nReport only the final value of $b$ as your answer.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in dislocation theory within solid-state physics, is well-posed with sufficient information to derive a unique solution, and is expressed in objective, formal language. We proceed with the solution by addressing the tasks in a logical sequence.\n\nThe first step is to identify the specific slip plane from the $\\{111\\}$ family that contains the given slip direction $[110]$. In a cubic crystal system, a direction $[uvw]$ lies in a plane $(hkl)$ if the direction vector is orthogonal to the plane's normal vector. The normal to the plane $(hkl)$ is the direction $[hkl]$. The condition for orthogonality is that their dot product is zero:\n$$h u + k v + l w = 0$$\nWe are given the slip direction $[uvw] = [110]$. We must find a plane $(hkl)$ from the $\\{111\\}$ family that satisfies this condition. The Miller indices $h$, $k$, and $l$ will be permutations of $\\pm 1$. Let's test a potential candidate, the $(1\\bar{1}1)$ plane. Here, $h=1$, $k=-1$, and $l=1$.\n$$(1)(1) + (-1)(1) + (1)(0) = 1 - 1 + 0 = 0$$\nThe condition is satisfied. Thus, the slip plane can be taken as $(1\\bar{1}1)$. Other planes such as $(\\bar{1}11)$ would also be valid, but the choice does not alter the final result for the magnitude of the Burgers vector due to the cubic symmetry of the crystal.\n\nNext, we construct the unit slip-plane normal vector $\\mathbf{n}$ and the unit slip direction vector $\\mathbf{s}$.\nThe slip plane is $(1\\bar{1}1)$, so its normal vector is in the $[1\\bar{1}1]$ direction. The vector is $\\mathbf{v}_n = 1\\mathbf{i} - 1\\mathbf{j} + 1\\mathbf{k}$. Its magnitude is $|\\mathbf{v}_n| = \\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{3}$.\nThe unit normal vector $\\mathbf{n}$ is:\n$$\\mathbf{n} = \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_n}{|\\mathbf{v}_n|} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}[1, -1, 1]$$\nThe slip direction is $[110]$. The corresponding vector is $\\mathbf{v}_s = 1\\mathbf{i} + 1\\mathbf{j} + 0\\mathbf{k}$. Its magnitude is $|\\mathbf{v}_s| = \\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 0^2} = \\sqrt{2}$.\nThe unit slip direction vector $\\mathbf{s}$ is:\n$$\\mathbf{s} = \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_s}{|\\mathbf{v}_s|} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[1, 1, 0]$$\n\nWe can define the dislocation line direction, $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$, for pure screw and pure edge characters.\nFor a pure screw dislocation, the line direction $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$ is parallel to the Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}$. Since the direction of $\\mathbf{b}$ is the slip direction $\\mathbf{s}$, we have:\n$$\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{\\text{screw}} = \\mathbf{s} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[1, 1, 0]$$\nFor a pure edge dislocation, the line direction $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$ is perpendicular to the Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}$ (and thus to $\\mathbf{s}$) and must lie within the slip plane, which means it is also perpendicular to the plane normal $\\mathbf{n}$. Therefore, $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{\\text{edge}}$ is collinear with the cross product of $\\mathbf{n}$ and $\\mathbf{s}$:\n$$\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{\\text{edge}} \\propto \\mathbf{n} \\times \\mathbf{s} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}[1, -1, 1] \\times \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[1, 1, 0] = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}[-1, 1, 2]$$\nThe unit vector for the edge dislocation line is $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}_{\\text{edge}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}[-1, 1, 2]$.\n\nFinally, we determine the magnitude $b$ of the Burgers vector for the shortest perfect lattice translation in an FCC crystal. A perfect dislocation is characterized by a Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}$ that is a lattice translation vector, meaning it connects two identical points in the crystal lattice. The dislocation's strain energy is proportional to the square of the Burgers vector's magnitude, $b^2$. Consequently, the most stable and common dislocations have the shortest possible Burgers vector.\n\nIn a Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) lattice with lattice parameter $a$, the atoms are located at the corners of the conventional cell (e.g., at $(0,0,0)$) and at the centers of each face (e.g., at $(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}, 0)$, $(\\frac{a}{2}, 0, \\frac{a}{2})$, etc.). The shortest distance between any two atoms is from a corner to an adjacent face center.\nThe vectors representing these shortest lattice translations are of the type $\\frac{a}{2}\\langle 110 \\rangle$. The problem specifies the slip direction as $[110]$. Therefore, the Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}$ is the shortest lattice translation vector in this direction:\n$$\\mathbf{b} = \\frac{a}{2}[1, 1, 0] = \\frac{a}{2}(\\mathbf{i} + \\mathbf{j})$$\nThe magnitude of this Burgers vector, $b$, is calculated as:\n$$b = |\\mathbf{b}| = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2 + 0^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2}{4} + \\frac{a^2}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2a^2}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2}{2}}$$\nSimplifying this expression gives the magnitude of the Burgers vector in terms of the lattice parameter $a$:\n$$b = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression for the magnitude of the Burgers vector.",

A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the statement of Frank's rule for Burgers vector conservation and its application to a specific dislocation reaction. Frank's rule states that if a set of dislocations meets at a single point (a node), the vector sum of their Burgers vectors must be zero, provided all vectors are defined as pointing either into the node or out of the node. In this reaction, two dislocations with Burgers vectors $\\mathbf{b}_{1}$ and $\\mathbf{b}_{2}$ combine to form a third dislocation with Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}_{3}$. If we define $\\mathbf{b}_{1}$ and $\\mathbf{b}_{2}$ as vectors pointing into the node and $\\mathbf{b}_{3}$ as the vector pointing out of the node, the conservation law is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{b}_{1} + \\mathbf{b}_{2} - \\mathbf{b}_{3} = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nThis implies that the Burgers vector of the product dislocation is the vector sum of the reactant Burgers vectors:\n$$\n\\mathbf{b}_{3} = \\mathbf{b}_{1} + \\mathbf{b}_{2}\n$$\nWe are given the reactant Burgers vectors in Miller index notation:\n$$\n\\mathbf{b}_{1} = \\frac{a}{2}[1\\bar{1}0] = \\frac{a}{2}(1, -1, 0)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{b}_{2} = \\frac{a}{2}[0\\,1\\bar{1}] = \\frac{a}{2}(0, 1, -1)\n$$\nWe can now calculate the resultant Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}_{3}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{b}_{3} = \\frac{a}{2}(1, -1, 0) + \\frac{a}{2}(0, 1, -1) = \\frac{a}{2}(1+0, -1+1, 0-1) = \\frac{a}{2}(1, 0, -1) = \\frac{a}{2}[10\\bar{1}]\n$$\nNext, we must determine the change in energy per unit length, $\\Delta E$. The initial state consists of the two reacting dislocations, so the initial energy per unit length, $E_{i}$, is the sum of their individual energies:\n$$\nE_{i} = E_{1} + E_{2}\n$$\nThe final state consists of the single product dislocation, so the final energy per unit length, $E_{f}$, is:\n$$\nE_{f} = E_{3}\n$$\nThe energy change per unit length is therefore:\n$$\n\\Delta E = E_{f} - E_{i} = E_{3} - (E_{1} + E_{2})\n$$\nThe energy of each dislocation segment is given by the isotropic line-tension approximation, $E_{k} = \\Gamma |\\mathbf{b}_{k}|^{2}$. To calculate these energies, we need the squared magnitudes of the Burgers vectors.\nFor $\\mathbf{b}_{1} = \\frac{a}{2}[1\\bar{1}0]$:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{b}_{1}|^{2} = \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^{2} (1^{2} + (-1)^{2} + 0^{2}) = \\frac{a^{2}}{4}(1 + 1) = \\frac{2a^{2}}{4} = \\frac{a^{2}}{2}\n$$\nFor $\\mathbf{b}_{2} = \\frac{a}{2}[0\\,1\\bar{1}]$:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{b}_{2}|^{2} = \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^{2} (0^{2} + 1^{2} + (-1)^{2}) = \\frac{a^{2}}{4}(1 + 1) = \\frac{2a^{2}}{4} = \\frac{a^{2}}{2}\n$$\nFor $\\mathbf{b}_{3} = \\frac{a}{2}[10\\bar{1}]$:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{b}_{3}|^{2} = \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^{2} (1^{2} + 0^{2} + (-1)^{2}) = \\frac{a^{2}}{4}(1 + 1) = \\frac{2a^{2}}{4} = \\frac{a^{2}}{2}\n$$\nNow we can compute the energies per unit length:\n$$\nE_{1} = \\Gamma |\\mathbf{b}_{1}|^{2} = \\Gamma \\frac{a^{2}}{2}\n$$\n$$\nE_{2} = \\Gamma |\\mathbf{b}_{2}|^{2} = \\Gamma \\frac{a^{2}}{2}\n$$\n$$\nE_{3} = \\Gamma |\\mathbf{b}_{3}|^{2} = \\Gamma \\frac{a^{2}}{2}\n$$\nThe initial and final energies per unit length are:\n$$\nE_{i} = E_{1} + E_{2} = \\Gamma \\frac{a^{2}}{2} + \\Gamma \\frac{a^{2}}{2} = \\Gamma a^{2}\n$$\n$$\nE_{f} = E_{3} = \\Gamma \\frac{a^{2}}{2}\n$$\nFinally, we calculate the energy change per unit length, $\\Delta E$:\n$$\n\\Delta E = E_{f} - E_{i} = \\Gamma \\frac{a^{2}}{2} - \\Gamma a^{2} = -\\frac{\\Gamma a^{2}}{2}\n$$\nThe problem asks whether the reaction can lower the energy. Since the lattice parameter $a$ is a positive length, $a^{2}$ is positive. The prefactor $\\Gamma$ is also given as positive. Therefore, the energy change $\\Delta E = -\\frac{\\Gamma a^{2}}{2}$ is negative. A negative energy change indicates that the final state is energetically more stable than the initial state. Thus, the reaction is energetically favorable and can proceed spontaneously to lower the system's energy. The derived expression is a single closed-form expression in terms of $a$ and $\\Gamma$, as required. The physical units are energy per length, consistent with J m$^{-1}$.",

It represents a valid and standard problem in the field of materials simulation. Therefore, a full solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe problem requires us to determine the net Burgers vector, $\\mathbf{B}_{\\text{net}}$, within a fundamental periodic simulation domain for two specific dislocation arrangements. The core principle governing this is often referred to as the conservation of topological charge.\n\nIn the context of dislocations, the \"charge\" is the Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}$. A dislocation line cannot terminate inside a crystal; it must either form a closed loop, extend to a free surface, or meet other dislocations at a node. A key property is that at a node where several dislocations meet, the sum of the Burgers vectors (when all are defined as pointing away from the node) must be zero: $\\sum_i \\mathbf{b}_i = \\mathbf{0}$.\n\nNow, consider a system simulated under Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBC) in all three dimensions. The crystal is effectively mapped onto a $3$-torus. In such a closed, periodic manifold, there are no \"free surfaces\" for a dislocation line to terminate on. Any dislocation line segment must be part of a closed loop entirely contained within the infinitely repeated periodic images.\n\nA more direct argument comes from the elastic energy. A single, isolated dislocation in an infinite medium has a long-range stress field that decays as $\\sigma \\propto 1/r$ and a displacement field that grows as $u \\propto \\ln(r)$, where $r$ is the distance from the line. The elastic strain energy per unit length of the dislocation diverges logarithmically with the size of the crystal. If one were to place a single dislocation (with a non-zero Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}$) into a periodic cell, this would create an infinite lattice of identical dislocations. The long-range stress fields from all these images would sum up, leading to a divergent strain energy for the unit cell. This is a physically and computationally untenable situation.\n\nFor the total elastic energy per unit cell to be finite, the long-range stress fields must cancel out on average. This cancellation occurs if and only if the sum of the Burgers vectors of all dislocations contained within the fundamental periodic domain is zero. This ensures that, when viewed from a large distance, the collection of dislocations acts as a multipole (dipole, quadrupole, etc.) whose field decays much faster (e.g., $\\sigma \\propto 1/r^2$ for a dipole) than that of a single dislocation. The sum over the periodic images of such a rapidly decaying field converges, yielding a finite energy.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental rule for any valid dislocation simulation under full PBC is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{B}_{\\text{net}} = \\sum_{i \\in \\text{cell}} \\mathbf{b}_i = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nThe net Burgers vector $\\mathbf{B}_{\\text{net}}$ is determined by simply summing the Burgers vectors of all dislocation lines that pass through the fundamental simulation cell. We can now apply this rule to the two arrangements described.\n\n**1. Dipole Arrangement:**\nThe simulation cell contains two dislocations:\n- One with Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}_1 = +\\mathbf{b}$.\n- One with Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}_2 = -\\mathbf{b}$.\nThe net Burgers vector is the sum:\n$$\n\\mathbf{B}_{\\text{net, dipole}} = \\mathbf{b}_1 + \\mathbf{b}_2 = (+\\mathbf{b}) + (-\\mathbf{b}) = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\n\n**2. Quadrupole Arrangement:**\nThe simulation cell contains four dislocations:\n- One with Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}_1 = +\\mathbf{b}$.\n- One with Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}_2 = -\\mathbf{b}$.\n- One with Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}_3 = +\\mathbf{b}$.\n- One with Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}_4 = -\\mathbf{b}$.\nThe net Burgers vector is the sum:\n$$\n\\mathbf{B}_{\\text{net, quadrupole}} = \\mathbf{b}_1 + \\mathbf{b}_2 + \\mathbf{b}_3 + \\mathbf{b}_4 = (+\\mathbf{b}) + (-\\mathbf{b}) + (+\\mathbf{b}) + (-\\mathbf{b}) = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nBoth arrangements satisfy the necessary condition for a valid periodic simulation by design.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. The residual net Burgers vector in the periodic cell is $ \\mathbf{0} $ for both the dipole and quadrupole arrangements.**\nAs derived above, $\\mathbf{B}_{\\text{net, dipole}} = \\mathbf{0}$ and $\\mathbf{B}_{\\text{net, quadrupole}} = \\mathbf{0}$. Both arrangements are explicitly constructed to have a zero net Burgers vector, which is a requirement for a well-posed periodic simulation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The residual net Burgers vector is $2\\mathbf{b}$ for the dipole arrangement due to periodic images, and $\\mathbf{0}$ for the quadrupole arrangement.**\nThis is incorrect. The net Burgers vector is defined for the contents of the *fundamental* cell, not by summing over images. The contribution from the fundamental cell for the dipole is $\\mathbf{0}$. The argument about periodic images is misapplied; their existence is the *reason* the net Burgers vector *must* be $\\mathbf{0}$, not a means to make it non-zero.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. If the cell vector $ \\mathbf{L}_{x} $ is not an integer multiple of $ \\mathbf{b} $, the residual net Burgers vector equals $ \\mathbf{b} $ for the dipole and $ 2\\mathbf{b} $ for the quadrupole.**\nThis statement incorrectly links the cell dimension $\\mathbf{L}_{x}$ to the net Burgers vector. $\\mathbf{B}_{\\text{net}}$ is determined solely by the sum of the Burgers vectors of the dislocations placed inside the cell. While the dimensions of the cell relative to the lattice vectors are important for avoiding spurious boundary stresses, they do not alter the topological charge conservation rule. The net Burgers vector for both valid arrangements is $\\mathbf{0}$, regardless of the cell dimensions.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The residual net Burgers vector is $ \\mathbf{b} $ for both arrangements unless a non-periodic boundary is used along the dislocation line.**\nThis is incorrect on two counts. First, the net Burgers vector for these arrangements is $\\mathbf{0}$, not $\\mathbf{b}$. A net Burgers vector of $\\mathbf{b}$ would correspond to a single dislocation in the cell, which is an invalid setup under full PBC. Second, while changing boundary conditions (e.g., making the $z$-direction non-periodic) alters the simulation type, it doesn't change the fact that the dipole and quadrupole arrangements described have a net Burgers vector of $\\mathbf{0}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
