            "solution": "The problem statement is a valid, well-posed problem in the field of computational materials science. It asks for the derivation of the spinodal locus for a binary mixture described by the Cahn-Hilliard equation with a Flory-Huggins free energy density. The problem is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and objective.\n\nThe analysis begins by determining the condition for the linear instability of a spatially uniform state, $c(\\mathbf{r}, t) = c_0$. The dynamics of the composition field $c(\\mathbf{r}, t)$ are governed by the Cahn–Hilliard equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = M \\nabla^2 \\mu\n$$\nwhere $M$ is a constant mobility and $\\mu$ is the chemical potential. The chemical potential is the variational derivative of the Ginzburg-Landau free-energy functional $\\mathcal{F}[c]$:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{\\delta \\mathcal{F}}{\\delta c} = \\frac{\\delta}{\\delta c} \\int_{\\Omega}\\left[f(c)+\\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\,|\\nabla c|^{2}\\right]\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{r}\n$$\nUsing the Euler-Lagrange equation, the variational derivative is:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial c}\\left(f(c)+\\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\,|\\nabla c|^{2}\\right) - \\nabla \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial (\\nabla c)}\\left(f(c)+\\frac{\\kappa}{2}\\,|\\nabla c|^{2}\\right)\n$$\nThis yields:\n$$\n\\mu = f'(c) - \\kappa \\nabla^2 c\n$$\nwhere $f'(c) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}c}$. Substituting this expression for $\\mu$ into the Cahn-Hilliard equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = M \\nabla^2 (f'(c) - \\kappa \\nabla^2 c) = M(\\nabla^2(f'(c)) - \\kappa \\nabla^4 c)\n$$\nTo perform a linear stability analysis, we consider a small perturbation $\\delta c(\\mathbf{r}, t)$ around the homogeneous steady state $c_0$:\n$$\nc(\\mathbf{r}, t) = c_0 + \\delta c(\\mathbf{r}, t)\n$$\nwhere $|\\delta c| \\ll 1$. We expand $f'(c)$ in a Taylor series around $c_0$ and keep only the linear term in $\\delta c$:\n$$\nf'(c) \\approx f'(c_0) + f''(c_0) \\delta c\n$$\nSubstituting this into the evolution equation for $c$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(c_0 + \\delta c) = M \\nabla^2 \\left( (f'(c_0) + f''(c_0) \\delta c) - \\kappa \\nabla^2(c_0 + \\delta c) \\right)\n$$\nThe left side becomes $\\frac{\\partial(\\delta c)}{\\partial t}$. On the right side, $f'(c_0)$ and $c_0$ are constants, so their spatial derivatives vanish. The equation linearizes to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial(\\delta c)}{\\partial t} = M \\nabla^2 \\left( f''(c_0) \\delta c - \\kappa \\nabla^2(\\delta c) \\right) = M f''(c_0) \\nabla^2(\\delta c) - M \\kappa \\nabla^4(\\delta c)\n$$\nWe analyze the stability by considering a single Fourier mode for the perturbation:\n$$\n\\delta c(\\mathbf{r}, t) = A \\exp(\\omega(k) t + i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{r})\n$$\nwhere $\\omega(k)$ is the amplification factor (or growth rate) and $\\mathbf{k}$ is the wavevector with magnitude $k = |\\mathbf{k}|$. Substituting this form into the linearized equation yields:\n$$\n\\omega(k) \\delta c = M f''(c_0) (-k^2 \\delta c) - M \\kappa (k^4 \\delta c)\n$$\nDividing by $\\delta c$ gives the dispersion relation for the growth rate $\\omega(k)$:\n$$\n\\omega(k) = -M k^2 (f''(c_0) + \\kappa k^2)\n$$\nThe uniform state $c_0$ is unstable if any perturbation can grow, which means $\\omega(k)  0$ for at least one value of $k$. Since $M  0$, $\\kappa  0$, and $k^2 \\ge 0$, the term $-M k^2$ is non-positive. For $\\omega(k)$ to be positive, the term $(f''(c_0) + \\kappa k^2)$ must be negative. This requires:\n$$\nf''(c_0) + \\kappa k^2  0 \\quad \\implies \\quad k^2  -\\frac{f''(c_0)}{\\kappa}\n$$\nThis inequality can only be satisfied for real $k  0$ if the right-hand side is positive, which means $f''(c_0)  0$. If $f''(c_0) \\ge 0$, then $\\omega(k) \\le 0$ for all $k$, and the system is linearly stable or metastable. Therefore, the condition for linear instability is $f''(c_0)  0$.\n\nThe boundary separating the stable/metastable region ($f''(c) \\ge 0$) from the unstable region ($f''(c)  0$) is called the spinodal. The spinodal locus is defined by the condition:\n$$\nf''(c) = 0\n$$\nWe are given the Flory-Huggins free-energy density:\n$$\nf(c) = k_B T \\left[c\\ln c+(1-c)\\ln(1-c)\\right]+\\chi c(1-c)\n$$\nFirst, we compute the first derivative, $f'(c)$:\n$$\nf'(c) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}c} \\left( k_B T \\left[c\\ln c+(1-c)\\ln(1-c)\\right]+\\chi c - \\chi c^2 \\right)\n$$\n$$\nf'(c) = k_B T \\left[(\\ln c + 1) + (-\\ln(1-c) - 1)\\right] + \\chi - 2\\chi c\n$$\n$$\nf'(c) = k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{c}{1-c}\\right) + \\chi(1 - 2c)\n$$\nNext, we compute the second derivative, $f''(c)$:\n$$\nf''(c) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}c} f'(c) = k_B T \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}c} \\left(\\ln c - \\ln(1-c)\\right) + \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}c} \\left(\\chi(1 - 2c)\\right)\n$$\n$$\nf''(c) = k_B T \\left(\\frac{1}{c} - \\frac{-1}{1-c}\\right) - 2\\chi = k_B T \\left(\\frac{1}{c} + \\frac{1}{1-c}\\right) - 2\\chi\n$$\n$$\nf''(c) = k_B T \\left(\\frac{1-c+c}{c(1-c)}\\right) - 2\\chi = \\frac{k_B T}{c(1-c)} - 2\\chi\n$$\nThe spinodal locus, denoted by $\\chi_s(c)$, is found by setting $f''(c)=0$:\n$$\n\\frac{k_B T}{c(1-c)} - 2\\chi_s(c) = 0\n$$\nSolving for $\\chi_s(c)$ gives the explicit analytical expression for the spinodal line:\n$$\n2\\chi_s(c) = \\frac{k_B T}{c(1-c)}\n$$\n$$\n\\chi_s(c) = \\frac{k_B T}{2c(1-c)}\n$$\nThis expression defines the boundary of thermodynamic instability for the given Flory-Huggins model.
