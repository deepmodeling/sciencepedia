It asks for the derivation of the spinodal locus for a binary mixture described by the Cahn-Hilliard equation with a Flory-Huggins free energy density.

The dynamics of the composition field $c(\\mathbf{r}, t)$ are governed by the Cahn–Hilliard equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = M \\nabla^2 \\mu\n$$\nwhere $M$ is a constant mobility and $\\mu$ is the chemical potential.

Euler-Lagrange Equation and Interfacial Profile\n\nThe free-energy functional is given by $\\mathcal{F}[c] = \\int f(c, c') dx$, where the integrand, or Lagrangian density, is $f(c, c') = \\frac{A}{4}(c^2-1)^2 + \\frac{\\kappa}{2}(c')^2$, with $c' = dc/dx$. The stationary profile that minimizes $\\mathcal{F}[c]$ satisfies the Euler-Lagrange equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial c} - \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial c'}\\right) = 0\n$$\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial c} = \\frac{A}{4} \\cdot 2(c^2-1) \\cdot (2c) = A c(c^2-1)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial c'} = \\kappa c'\n$$\nSubstituting these into the Euler-Lagrange equation yields the governing ODE for the stationary profile $c(x)$:\n$$\nA c(c^2-1) - \\kappa \\frac{d^2c}{dx^2} = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\kappa c'' = A c(c^2-1)\n$$\nSince the Lagrangian density $f$ does not depend explicitly on $x$, there exists a first integral of motion (the Beltrami identity): $f - c' \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial c'} = \\text{constant}$.\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{A}{4}(c^2-1)^2 + \\frac{\\kappa}{2}(c')^2\\right) - c'(\\kappa c') = \\frac{A}{4}(c^2-1)^2 - \\frac{\\kappa}{2}(c')^2 = \\text{constant}\n$$\nThe boundary conditions are that as $x \\to \\pm\\infty$, the system is in a homogeneous phase, so $c \\to \\pm 1$ and the gradient vanishes, $c' \\to 0$. Applying these conditions, the constant of integration is $\\frac{A}{4}((\\pm 1)^2 - 1)^2 - \\frac{\\kappa}{2}(0)^2 = 0$. This gives a first-order ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{A}{4}(c^2-1)^2 = \\frac{\\kappa}{2}(c')^2 \\quad \\implies \\quad (c')^2 = \\frac{A}{2\\kappa}(1-c^2)^2\n$$\nTaking the square root (and selecting the positive root for a profile increasing with $x$):\n$$\n\\frac{dc}{dx} = \\sqrt{\\frac{A}{2\\kappa}}(1-c^2)\n$$\nThis is a separable equation. We integrate it with the condition that the interface is centered at $x=0$, i.e., $c(0)=0$.\n$$\n\\int_0^c \\frac{d\\tilde{c}}{1-\\tilde{c}^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{A}{2\\kappa}} \\int_0^x d\\tilde{x}\n$$\nThe integral on the left is $\\arctanh(c)$.\n$$\n\\arctanh(c) = \\sqrt{\\frac{A}{2\\kappa}} x\n$$\nSolving for $c(x)$, we obtain the explicit interfacial profile:\n$$\nc(x) = \\tanh\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{A}{2\\kappa}} x\\right)\n$$\nThe characteristic length scale, or interfacial width $\\xi$, is defined by writing the argument as $x/\\xi$. By comparison, we find:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\xi} = \\sqrt{\\frac{A}{2\\kappa}} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\xi = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\kappa}{A}}\n$$\nThe profile can thus be written as $c(x) = \\tanh(x/\\xi)$.\n\nFor the remainder of the analysis, we work with a non-dimensional coordinate $\\tilde{x} = x/\\xi$. The profile is then simply $\\tilde{c}(\\tilde{x}) = \\tanh(\\tilde{x})$. The slope is $\\frac{dc}{dx} = \\frac{1}{\\xi}\\frac{d\\tilde{c}}{d\\tilde{x}}$. A relative error $\\varepsilon$ on the dimensional slope $c'(0)=1/\\xi$ is equivalent to an absolute error of $\\varepsilon$ on the dimensionless slope $\\tilde{c}'(0)=1$.\n\n### 2. Finite-Difference Resolution Criterion\n\nThe second-order centered finite-difference approximation for the first derivative has a leading-order truncation error given by:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{FD}}(x) = \\frac{1}{6} \\frac{d^3c}{dx^3} (\\Delta x)^2\n$$\nIn dimensionless units, this is $E_{\\mathrm{FD}}(\\tilde{x}) = \\frac{1}{6} \\frac{d^3\\tilde{c}}{d\\tilde{x}^3} (\\Delta \\tilde{x})^2$, where $\\Delta \\tilde{x} = \\Delta x/\\xi$. The criterion requires the relative error at the center ($x=0$ or $\\tilde{x}=0$) to be at most $\\varepsilon$. As argued, this is equivalent to the absolute error in the dimensionless slope being at most $\\varepsilon$.\n$$\n|\\text{Error at } \\tilde{x}=0| \\le \\varepsilon\n$$\nWe need the third derivative of $\\tilde{c}(\\tilde{x}) = \\tanh(\\tilde{x})$ at $\\tilde{x}=0$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\tilde{c}}{d\\tilde{x}} = \\text{sech}^2(\\tilde{x})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\tilde{c}}{d\\tilde{x}^2} = -2\\text{sech}^2(\\tilde{x})\\tanh(\\tilde{x})\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d^3\\tilde{c}}{d\\tilde{x}^3} = 4\\text{sech}^2(\\tilde{x})\\tanh^2(\\tilde{x}) - 2\\text{sech}^4(\\tilde{x})\n$$\nEvaluating at $\\tilde{x}=0$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^3\\tilde{c}}{d\\tilde{x}^3}\\bigg|_{\\tilde{x}=0} = 4(1)^2(0)^2 - 2(1)^4 = -2\n$$\nThe absolute error in the slope at the center is:\n$$\n|E_{\\mathrm{FD}}(0)| = \\left| \\frac{1}{6}(-2)(\\Delta\\tilde{x})^2 \\right| = \\frac{1}{3}(\\Delta\\tilde{x})^2\n$$\nImposing the error criterion:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{3}(\\Delta\\tilde{x})^2 \\le \\varepsilon \\quad \\implies \\quad \\Delta\\tilde{x} \\le \\sqrt{3\\varepsilon}\n$$\nTo find the minimum number of points, we take the largest permissible grid spacing, $\\Delta \\tilde{x}_{\\mathrm{FD}} = \\sqrt{3\\varepsilon}$. In dimensional terms, $\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{FD}} = \\xi\\sqrt{3\\varepsilon}$. The required number of grid points is $N_{\\mathrm{FD}} = L / \\Delta x_{\\mathrm{FD}} = \\frac{L}{\\xi\\sqrt{3\\varepsilon}}$.\n\n### 3. Spectral Method Resolution Criterion\n\nFor a spectral method, the error is governed by the rate of decay of the Fourier spectrum of the function being resolved. The function $\\tilde{c}(\\tilde{x}) = \\tanh(\\tilde{x})$ is analytic on the real axis. Its singularities in the complex plane $\\tilde{z}=\\tilde{x}+i\\tilde{y}$ are poles located where $\\cosh(\\tilde{z})=0$, which occurs at $\\tilde{z} = i(\\pi/2 + n\\pi)$ for any integer $n$. The nearest singularities to the real axis are at $\\tilde{z} = \\pm i\\pi/2$. The distance of the nearest singularity from the real axis is thus $d = \\pi/2$.\n\nThe Fourier transform of a function analytic in a strip of width $2d$ around the real axis decays for large wavenumber $k$ as $|\\hat{f}(k)| \\sim \\exp(-d|k|)$. The error in a spectral method is dominated by this exponential decay. We are interested in the error of the derivative, $\\tilde{c}'(\\tilde{x})$. The error arises from truncating the Fourier representation at the Nyquist wavenumber $\\tilde{k}_{\\max} = \\pi/\\Delta\\tilde{x}$.\n\nThe truncation error in the slope at $\\tilde{x}=0$ will be dominated by the amplitude of the first neglected modes. This error scales as $\\exp(-d \\tilde{k}_{\\max})$. We impose that this error is at most $\\varepsilon$:\n$$\n\\exp(-d \\tilde{k}_{\\max}) \\approx \\varepsilon\n$$\nSubstituting $d=\\pi/2$ and $\\tilde{k}_{\\max} = \\pi / \\Delta\\tilde{x}_{\\mathrm{spec}}$:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\frac{\\pi}{\\Delta\\tilde{x}_{\\mathrm{spec}}}\\right) \\approx \\varepsilon\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{\\pi^2}{2\\Delta\\tilde{x}_{\\mathrm{spec}}} \\approx \\ln(\\varepsilon)\n$$\nFor $0  \\varepsilon  1$, $\\ln(\\varepsilon)$ is negative. It is more convenient to write $\\ln(\\varepsilon) = -\\ln(1/\\varepsilon)$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\pi^2}{2\\Delta\\tilde{x}_{\\mathrm{spec}}} \\approx \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\n$$\nSolving for the required grid spacing gives the upper bound:\n$$\n\\Delta\\tilde{x}_{\\mathrm{spec}} \\approx \\frac{\\pi^2}{2\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right)}\n$$\nIn dimensional units, $\\Delta x_{\\mathrm{spec}} = \\frac{\\xi \\pi^2}{2\\ln(1/\\varepsilon)}$. The minimum number of grid points is $N_{\\mathrm{spec}} = L / \\Delta x_{\\mathrm{spec}} = \\frac{2L\\ln(1/\\varepsilon)}{\\xi\\pi^2}$.\n\n### 4. Ratio of Grid-Point Counts\n\nWe now compute the ratio $R(\\varepsilon) = N_{\\mathrm{FD}} / N_{\\mathrm{spec}}$.\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{FD}} = \\frac{L}{\\xi\\sqrt{3\\varepsilon}}\n$$\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{spec}} = \\frac{2L\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right)}{\\xi\\pi^2}\n$$\nThe ratio is:\n$$\nR(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{FD}}}{N_{\\mathrm{spec}}} = \\frac{L/(\\xi\\sqrt{3\\varepsilon})}{2L\\ln(1/\\varepsilon)/(\\xi\\pi^2)} = \\frac{L}{\\xi\\sqrt{3\\varepsilon}} \\cdot \\frac{\\xi\\pi^2}{2L\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right)}\n$$\nThe parameters $L$ and $\\xi$ cancel, yielding an expression that depends only on the tolerance $\\varepsilon$:\n$$\nR(\\varepsilon) = \\frac{\\pi^2}{2\\sqrt{3\\varepsilon}\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right)}\n$$\nThis result highlights the \"spectral accuracy\" of the Fourier method, where the number of required grid points grows only logarithmically with decreasing error ($N_{\\mathrm{spec}} \\sim \\ln(1/\\varepsilon)$), as opposed to the algebraic growth for the finite-difference method ($N_{\\mathrm{FD}} \\sim \\varepsilon^{-1/2}$).",
