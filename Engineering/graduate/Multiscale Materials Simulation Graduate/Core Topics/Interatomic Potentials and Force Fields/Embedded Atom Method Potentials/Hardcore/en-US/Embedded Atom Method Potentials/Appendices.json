            "problem": "Consider a monatomic crystal with face-centered cubic (fcc) structure and conventional cubic lattice parameter $a$. In the Embedded Atom Method (EAM), the host electron density at atom $i$ is defined as $\\rho_i = \\sum_{j \\neq i} f(r_{ij})$, where $r_{ij}$ is the scalar distance between atoms $i$ and $j$, and $f(r)$ is a spherically decaying electron cloud contribution from atom $j$ to atom $i$. Assume $f(r) = \\rho_s \\exp(-\\alpha r)$, where $\\rho_s$ is a constant amplitude and $\\alpha > 0$ is the decay rate. \n\nStarting from the definition of the electron density and the geometric structure of an fcc lattice, do the following:\n\n1. Determine, from first principles of the fcc geometry, the distances and coordination numbers for the first three neighbor shells around a given atom. Use these to construct the truncated host electron density $\\rho_i^{(3)}(\\alpha,a)$ that includes only contributions from the first three shells. Express $\\rho_i^{(3)}(\\alpha,a)$ in a closed form in terms of $a$, $\\alpha$, and $\\rho_s$.\n\n2. Define the shell contributions $C_k(\\alpha,a)$ for $k=1,2,3$ as the partial sums from the $k$-th shell alone. Analyze qualitatively and quantitatively how the relative weights $w_k(\\alpha,a) = C_k(\\alpha,a)\\big/\\sum_{m=1}^{3}C_m(\\alpha,a)$ vary with $\\alpha$, including their limiting behavior as $\\alpha \\to 0^{+}$ and as $\\alpha \\to +\\infty$.\n\n3.

            "solution": "We begin from the Embedded Atom Method (EAM) definition of host electron density at site $i$,\n$$\n\\rho_i \\;=\\; \\sum_{j \\neq i} f(r_{ij}),\n$$\nwith $f(r) = \\rho_s \\exp(-\\alpha r)$, where $\\rho_s$ is a constant amplitude and $\\alpha > 0$ is the decay parameter. For a perfect face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal with conventional cubic lattice parameter $a$, the distances to neighbors occur in discrete shells determined by the lattice geometry. We will construct the first three shells from geometric considerations and then build $\\rho_i^{(3)}(\\alpha,a)$.\n\nFirst, we recall the geometry of the fcc lattice. In the conventional cubic cell of edge length $a$, the lattice points are at the cube corners and the face centers. The neighbor shells are characterized by distances determined by vectors connecting lattice sites.\n\nWe now enumerate the first three shells for an atom at the origin:\n\n1. Nearest neighbors ($k=1$): These are located at face-centered positions relative to the origin. Representative vectors are of the form $(\\frac{a}{2},\\frac{a}{2},0)$ and its permutations and sign changes. The distance is\n$$\nr_1 \\;=\\; \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^{2}} \\;=\\; \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}}.\n$$\nThere are $12$ such nearest neighbors in fcc, so the coordination number is $z_1 = 12$.\n\n2. Second neighbors ($k=2$): These lie along the cubic axes, e.g., $(a,0,0)$, $(0,a,0)$, $(0,0,a)$ and their negatives. The distance is\n$$\nr_2 \\;=\\; a,\n$$\nand there are $6$ such neighbors, so $z_2 = 6$.\n\n3. Third neighbors ($k=3$): A representative vector for the third shell is $\\left(a,\\frac{a}{2},\\frac{a}{2}\\right)$ and its permutations and sign changes, which yields a distance\n$$\nr_3 \\;=\\; \\sqrt{a^{2}+\\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^{2}+\\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^{2}} \\;=\\; a\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}}.\n$$\nThere are $24$ such neighbors in this shell, so $z_3 = 24$.\n\nGiven $f(r) = \\rho_s \\exp(-\\alpha r)$, the shell contributions $C_k(\\alpha,a)$ and the truncated electron density $\\rho_i^{(3)}(\\alpha,a)$ are\n$$\nC_1(\\alpha,a) \\;=\\; z_1\\,\\rho_s \\exp\\!\\left(-\\alpha r_1\\right) \\;=\\; 12\\,\\rho_s \\exp\\!\\left(-\\alpha \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right),\n$$\n$$\nC_2(\\alpha,a) \\;=\\; z_2\\,\\rho_s \\exp\\!\\left(-\\alpha r_2\\right) \\;=\\; 6\\,\\rho_s \\exp(-\\alpha a),\n$$\n$$\nC_3(\\alpha,a) \\;=\\; z_3\\,\\rho_s \\exp\\!\\left(-\\alpha r_3\\right) \\;=\\; 24\\,\\rho_s \\exp\\!\\left(-\\alpha a\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}}\\right),\n$$\nand hence\n$$\n\\rho_i^{(3)}(\\alpha,a) \\;=\\; C_1(\\alpha,a) + C_2(\\alpha,a) + C_3(\\alpha,a) \\;=\\; \\rho_s\\left[12\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\alpha \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) + 6\\,\\exp(-\\alpha a) + 24\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\alpha a\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}}\\right)\\right].\n$$\n\nWe define the relative weights $w_k(\\alpha,a)$ over the first three shells by\n$$\nw_k(\\alpha,a) \\;=\\; \\frac{C_k(\\alpha,a)}{C_1(\\alpha,a)+C_2(\\alpha,a)+C_3(\\alpha,a)}.\n$$\nThe qualitative dependence on $\\alpha$ follows from the monotonicity of the exponential function. As $\\alpha$ increases, $\\exp(-\\alpha r)$ decays faster with $r$, so nearer neighbors contribute relatively more. This means $w_1(\\alpha,a)$ increases while $w_2(\\alpha,a)$ and $w_3(\\alpha,a)$ decrease. In the limit $\\alpha \\to 0^{+}$, $\\exp(-\\alpha r)\\to 1$, so shell weights are proportional only to coordination numbers:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\alpha\\to 0^{+}}w_1 \\;=\\; \\frac{12}{12+6+24} \\;=\\; \\frac{12}{42} \\;=\\; \\frac{2}{7}, \\quad\n\\lim_{\\alpha\\to 0^{+}}w_2 \\;=\\; \\frac{6}{42} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{7}, \\quad\n\\lim_{\\alpha\\to 0^{+}}w_3 \\;=\\; \\frac{24}{42} \\;=\\; \\frac{4}{7}.\n$$\nIn the opposite limit $\\alpha \\to +\\infty$, the exponential suppresses all but the shortest distance term ($r_1$), yielding\n$$\n\\lim_{\\alpha\\to +\\infty}w_1 \\;=\\; 1,\\qquad \\lim_{\\alpha\\to +\\infty}w_2 \\;=\\; 0,\\qquad \\lim_{\\alpha\\to +\\infty}w_3 \\;=\\; 0.\n$$\n\nWe now quantify the condition under which the first shell “dominates” by imposing $C_2(\\alpha,a) \\leq 0.05\\, C_1(\\alpha,a)$ and $C_3(\\alpha,a) \\leq 0.05\\, C_1(\\alpha,a)$. These two inequalities yield lower bounds on $\\alpha$; the minimal $\\alpha$ satisfying both is the maximum of these bounds.\n\nFirst, compare shell $2$ to shell $1$:\n$$\n\\frac{C_2}{C_1} \\;=\\; \\frac{6\\,\\rho_s \\exp(-\\alpha a)}{12\\,\\rho_s \\exp\\!\\left(-\\alpha \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\alpha a\\left[1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right]\\right) \\;\\leq\\; 0.05 \n\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad\n\\alpha \\;\\geq\\; \\frac{\\ln(10)}{a\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)}.\n$$\n\nSecond, compare shell $3$ to shell $1$:\n$$\n\\frac{C_3}{C_1} \\;=\\; \\frac{24\\,\\rho_s \\exp\\!\\left(-\\alpha a\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}}\\right)}{12\\,\\rho_s \\exp\\!\\left(-\\alpha \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)} \\;=\\; 2\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\alpha a\\left[\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right]\\right) \\;\\leq\\; 0.05 \n\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad\n\\alpha \\;\\geq\\; \\frac{\\ln(40)}{a\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)}.\n$$\n\nTherefore, the minimal decay rate $\\alpha^{\\ast}(a)$ that guarantees both constraints is the larger of the two lower bounds:\n$$\n\\alpha^{\\ast}(a) \\;=\\; \\max\\!\\left\\{\\, \\frac{\\ln(10)}{a\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)}\\,,\\, \\frac{\\ln(40)}{a\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{2}} - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)} \\right\\}.\n$$\nTo determine which bound is larger without relying on numerical evaluation, we can compare the dimensionless quantities $\\frac{\\ln(10)}{1 - 1/\\sqrt{2}}$ and $\\frac{\\ln(40)}{\\sqrt{3/2} - 1/\\sqrt{2}}$.\nLet's analyze the arguments of the `max` function. We compare $\\frac{\\ln(10)}{1-1/\\sqrt{2}} \\approx \\frac{2.303}{0.293} \\approx 7.86$ and $\\frac{\\ln(40)}{\\sqrt{1.5}-1/\\sqrt{2}} \\approx \\frac{3.689}{1.225-0.707} \\approx \\frac{3.689}{0.518} \\approx 7.12$.\nThe first term is larger. Thus, the first constraint (from the second shell) is more restrictive than the second constraint (from the third shell). The minimal decay rate is therefore determined by the comparison with the second shell.\n$$\n\\alpha^{\\ast}(a) \\;=\\; \\frac{\\ln(10)}{a\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)}.\n$$\nThis closed-form expression provides the symbolic dependence of the threshold decay rate on the lattice parameter $a$ that ensures each of the second and third shell contributions is no more than $5\\%$ of the first-shell contribution.",

In practice, each radial function is truncated at a finite cutoff radius $r_c$ to maintain computational efficiency. A naive truncation $f(r) \\mapsto f(r) \\,\\Theta(r_c - r)$, with $\\Theta$ the Heaviside step function and $f \\in \\{\\phi,g\\}$, can induce discontinuities in forces and in the virial-based stress when atom pairs cross $r_c$ during dynamics or when the configuration is subjected to an infinitesimal homogeneous strain.\n\nTo eliminate these artifacts, one replaces $f(r)$ by a tapered form $f(r) s(r)$, where $s(r)$ transitions smoothly from $1$ to $0$ in an interval $[r_s, r_c]$ with $r_s < r_c$, and is constant outside the interval. Starting from the EAM energy definition, the force definition $\\mathbf{F}_k = -\\nabla_{\\mathbf{r}_k} E$, and the virial (Irving–Kirkwood) stress definition for pairwise central forces, argue how the differentiability of $s(r)$ near $r_c$ impacts the continuity of forces and virials, and determine the minimal smoothness requirements on $s(r)$ at $r = r_c$ and at $r = r_s$ so that both the forces and the virial are continuous functions of the atomic positions and of an infinitesimal homogeneous strain parameter.\n\nThen, constrained by these smoothness requirements and by $s(r)$ being constant outside $[r_s,r_c]$, construct the lowest-degree polynomial taper $s(r)$ on the interval $[r_s, r_c]$ that satisfies the boundary conditions implied by your analysis. Express your final result as a single closed-form analytic expression for $s(r)$ valid for $r \\in [r_s, r_c]$ in terms of $r$, $r_s$, and $r_c$ only. No numerical approximation is required for the final answer.",
            "solution": "The solution proceeds in two parts. First, we determine the minimal smoothness requirements on the taper function $s(r)$. Second, we construct the polynomial form of $s(r)$ that satisfies these requirements.\n\nLet the tapered functions be $\\tilde{\\phi}(r) = \\phi(r)s(r)$ and $\\tilde{g}(r) = g(r)s(r)$. The force on an atom involves first derivatives of these functions, e.g., $\\tilde{\\phi}'(r) = \\phi'(r)s(r) + \\phi(r)s'(r)$. For forces to be continuous functions of atomic positions as an atom pair crosses the taper boundaries $r_s$ and $r_c$, the functions $\\tilde{\\phi}(r)$ and $\\tilde{\\phi}'(r)$ (and likewise $\\tilde{g}(r)$ and $\\tilde{g}'(r)$) must be continuous. This requires $s(r)$ to be continuously differentiable ($C^1$). Since $s(r)$ is constant outside $[r_s, r_c]$, we have the boundary conditions: $s(r_s)=1$, $s(r_c)=0$, and $s'(r_s)=0$, $s'(r_c)=0$.\n\nThe problem also requires that the virial stress be continuous under an infinitesimal homogeneous strain. Physical properties derived from strain derivatives of the energy, such as the elastic constants ($C_{ijkl} \\propto \\partial^2 E / \\partial \\epsilon^2$), must also be well-behaved. For the elastic constants to be continuous functions of atomic positions, the second derivatives of the potential functions, e.g., $\\tilde{\\phi}''(r)$, must be continuous. The second derivative is $\\tilde{\\phi}''(r) = \\phi''(r)s(r) + 2\\phi'(r)s'(r) + \\phi(r)s''(r)$. Assuming the base functions $\\phi, \\phi', \\phi''$ are smooth, continuity of this term requires $s(r)$ to be twice continuously differentiable ($C^2$). This adds two more boundary conditions: $s''(r_s)=0$ and $s''(r_c)=0$.\n\nIn summary, we have six boundary conditions for $s(r)$ on the interval $[r_s, r_c]$:\n1. $s(r_s) = 1$\n2. $s(r_c) = 0$\n3. $s'(r_s) = 0$\n4. $s'(r_c) = 0$\n5. $s''(r_s) = 0$\n6. $s''(r_c) = 0$\n\nTo satisfy these six conditions with the lowest-degree polynomial, we need a quintic (degree 5) polynomial. It is convenient to define a normalized variable $x = \\frac{r - r_s}{r_c - r_s}$, so that $x \\in [0, 1]$ corresponds to $r \\in [r_s, r_c]$. We seek a polynomial $P(x) = ax^5 + bx^4 + cx^3 + dx^2 + ex + f$.\n\nThe boundary conditions at $x=0$ are $P(0)=1, P'(0)=0, P''(0)=0$. These immediately give $f=1, e=0, d=0$.\nThe polynomial simplifies to $P(x) = ax^5 + bx^4 + cx^3 + 1$.\n\nThe boundary conditions at $x=1$ are $P(1)=0, P'(1)=0, P''(1)=0$. This yields a system of three linear equations for the remaining coefficients $a,b,c$:\n1. $P(1) = a+b+c+1 = 0$\n2. $P'(1) = 5a+4b+3c = 0$\n3. $P''(1) = 20a+12b+6c = 0 \\implies 10a+6b+3c = 0$\n\nSolving this system yields $a=-6, b=15, c=-10$.\nThe polynomial in the normalized coordinate is therefore:\n$$\nP(x) = -6x^5 + 15x^4 - 10x^3 + 1\n$$\nSubstituting back $x = \\frac{r - r_s}{r_c - r_s}$, we obtain the final expression for the taper function $s(r)$ on the interval $[r_s, r_c]$.",
