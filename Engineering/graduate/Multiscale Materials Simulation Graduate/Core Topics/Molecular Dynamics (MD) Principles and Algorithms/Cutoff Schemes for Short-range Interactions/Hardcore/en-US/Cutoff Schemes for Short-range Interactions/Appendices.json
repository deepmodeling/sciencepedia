A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe total potential energy $U$ of a system of $N$ particles in a volume $\\mathcal{V}$ described by a pair potential $V(r)$ can be expressed in terms of the number density $\\rho = N/\\mathcal{V}$ and the pair correlation function $g(r)$. For a homogeneous and isotropic fluid, the potential energy per particle, $u = U/N$, is given by:\n$$\nu = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho \\int_0^{\\infty} V(r) g(r) 4 \\pi r^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}r = 2 \\pi \\rho \\int_0^{\\infty} V(r) g(r) r^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}r\n$$\nThe factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$ corrects for the double counting of pairs. When the potential is truncated at a cutoff radius $r_c$, an error $\\Delta u$ is introduced, which corresponds to the contribution from the tail of the integral for $r \\ge r_c$.\n$$\n\\Delta u = 2 \\pi \\rho \\int_{r_c}^{\\infty} V(r) g(r) r^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}r\n$$\n\n**Part 1: General Bound and Scaling**\n\nWe are asked to find a bound on the magnitude of the truncation error, $|\\Delta u|$. Using the triangle inequality for integrals:\n$$\n|\\Delta u| = \\left| 2 \\pi \\rho \\int_{r_c}^{\\infty} V(r) g(r) r^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}r \\right| \\le 2 \\pi \\rho \\int_{r_c}^{\\infty} |V(r)| |g(r)| r^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}r\n$$\nThe problem states that for large separations, the pair correlations are bounded by a finite value $g_{\\infty} \\ge 0$. We assume $r_c$ is large enough so that $|g(r)| \\le g_{\\infty}$ for all $r \\ge r_c$. The problem also states that there exist constants $A  0$, $p  3$, and $r_0  0$ such that $|V(r)| \\le A r^{-p}$ for all $r \\ge r_0$. We assume $r_c \\ge r_0$. Applying these bounds:\n$$\n|\\Delta u| \\le 2 \\pi \\rho g_{\\infty} \\int_{r_c}^{\\infty} (A r^{-p}) r^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}r = 2 \\pi \\rho g_{\\infty} A \\int_{r_c}^{\\infty} r^{2-p} \\,\\mathrm{d}r\n$$\nThe integral can be evaluated directly. Since $p  3$, the exponent $2-p$ is less than $-1$, ensuring convergence.\n$$\n\\int_{r_c}^{\\infty} r^{2-p} \\,\\mathrm{d}r = \\left[ \\frac{r^{3-p}}{3-p} \\right]_{r_c}^{\\infty}\n$$\nBecause $p  3$, the exponent $3-p$ is negative, so $\\lim_{r\\to\\infty} r^{3-p} = 0$. The integral evaluates to:\n$$\n0 - \\frac{r_c^{3-p}}{3-p} = \\frac{r_c^{3-p}}{p-3}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the inequality gives the bound on $|\\Delta u|$:\n$$\n|\\Delta u| \\le \\frac{2 \\pi \\rho g_{\\infty} A}{p-3} r_c^{3-p}\n$$\nThis shows that the bound on the magnitude of the truncation error scales with the cutoff radius as $|\\Delta u| \\propto r_c^{3-p}$.\n\n**Part 2: Lennard-Jones Potential**\n\nNow we consider the specific case of the Lennard-Jones potential:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r) = 4 \\epsilon \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^{12} - \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{r}\\right)^{6} \\right]\n$$\nThe truncation error is:\n$$\n\\Delta u = 2 \\pi \\rho \\int_{r_c}^{\\infty} V_{\\mathrm{LJ}}(r) g(r) r^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}r\n$$\nThe problem specifies using the \"standard large-distance tail approximation\" for $g(r)$ in the limit $r_c/\\sigma \\to \\infty$.

The bound is:\n$$|\\Delta f(r)| \\le |S'(r)||\\phi(r)| + (1 - S(r))|\\phi'(r)|$$\n\n**4. Comparison of the Supremum of $|S'(r)|$**\n\nThe problem asks for a comparison of the $|S'(r)||\\phi(r)|$ term, which requires finding the supremum of $|S'(r)|$ for both functions over the interval $[r_{s}, r_{c}]$.\n\nFor the cubic function:\n$S'_{\\mathrm{cub}}(r) = \\frac{1}{w} g'_{\\mathrm{cub}}(x) = \\frac{1}{w}(6x^2 - 6x) = \\frac{6}{w}x(x-1)$.\nSince $x \\in [0, 1]$, the term $x(x-1)$ is non-positive.\n$|S'_{\\mathrm{cub}}(r)| = \\frac{6}{w}|x(x-1)| = \\frac{6}{w}(x - x^2)$.\nTo find the maximum of this expression on $[0,1]$, we find the vertex of the parabola $p(x) = x - x^2$. The maximum occurs at $x = -1/(2(-1)) = 1/2$.\nThe maximum value of $|g'_{\\mathrm{cub}}(x)| = 6(x-x^2)$ is at $x=1/2$:\n$|g'_{\\mathrm{cub}}(1/2)| = 6(\\frac{1}{2} - (\\frac{1}{2})^2) = 6(\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{4}) = 6(\\frac{1}{4}) = \\frac{3}{2}$.\nTherefore, $\\sup_{r \\in [r_{s}, r_{c}]} |S'_{\\mathrm{cub}}(r)| = \\frac{1}{w} \\sup_{x \\in [0, 1]} |g'_{\\mathrm{cub}}(x)| = \\frac{3}{2w}$.\n\nFor the quintic function:\n$S'_{\\mathrm{qui}}(r) = \\frac{1}{w} g'_{\\mathrm{qui}}(x) = \\frac{1}{w}(-30x^4 + 60x^3 - 30x^2) = -\\frac{30}{w}x^2(x^2 - 2x + 1) = -\\frac{30}{w}x^2(x-1)^2$.\nThe term $x^2(x-1)^2$ is non-negative for all $x$. Thus, $S'_{\\mathrm{qui}}(r)$ is non-positive on the interval.\n$|S'_{\\mathrm{qui}}(r)| = \\frac{30}{w}x^2(x-1)^2 = \\frac{30}{w}[x(1-x)]^2$.\nThe maximum of this expression occurs where $x(1-x)$ is maximum, which is at $x=1/2$. At this point, $x(1-x) = 1/4$.\nThe maximum value of $|g'_{\\mathrm{qui}}(x)| = 30[x(1-x)]^2$ is at $x=1/2$:\n$|g'_{\\mathrm{qui}}(1/2)| = 30[(\\frac{1}{2})(1-\\frac{1}{2})]^2 = 30(\\frac{1}{4})^2 = \\frac{30}{16} = \\frac{15}{8}$.\nTherefore, $\\sup_{r \\in [r_{s}, r_{c}]} |S'_{\\mathrm{qui}}(r)| = \\frac{1}{w} \\sup_{x \\in [0, 1]} |g'_{\\mathrm{qui}}(x)| = \\frac{15}{8w}$.\n\n**5. Final Ratio Calculation**\n\nThe required ratio is:\n$$\\frac{\\sup_{r \\in [r_{s}, r_{c}]} |S_{\\mathrm{cub}}'(r)|}{\\sup_{r \\in [r_{s}, r_{c}]} |S_{\\mathrm{qui}}'(r)|} = \\frac{\\frac{3}{2w}}{\\frac{15}{8w}} = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{8}{15} = \\frac{24}{30} = \\frac{4}{5}$$\nThe ratio is a dimensionless constant, indicating that for a given switching width $w$, the maximum magnitude of the derivative of the cubic switching function is $4/5$ that of the quintic switching function. This is counter-intuitive as higher-order smoothing is generally expected to reduce derivatives, but here we see the opposite for the first derivative's peak magnitude. The quintic function's additional constraints force its slope to be steeper in the middle of the interval to satisfy the zero-derivative conditions at both ends.",

            "introduction": "The choice of a cutoff radius is intrinsically linked to the periodic boundary conditions (PBC) that define the simulation volume. A fundamental rule is that the cutoff radius $r_c$ must not exceed half the shortest dimension of the simulation cell to ensure each pair of particles interacts at most once. This practice provides a quantitative analysis of what goes wrong when this rule is violated, asking you to derive the spurious contributions to system energy and pressure that arise from breaking the minimum image convention.",

The scenario of a cutoff radius $r_c  L/2$ is a known potential source of error in molecular simulations, making its analysis a valid scientific question. The provided formulae for energy and pressure are standard. The assumptions ($g(r) \\approx 1$, differentiability of $u(r)$, leading-order analysis in $\\Delta/L$) are clearly stated and render the problem solvable. The problem is self-contained, objective, and non-trivial. No scientific, logical, or factual flaws are detected.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full, reasoned solution is warranted.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires us to determine the consequences of using a cutoff radius $r_c = L/2 + \\Delta$ that exceeds half the box length $L/2$ in a cubic periodic system. This can lead to a single pair of particles interacting with more than one of its periodic images, a violation of the principle that the potential range should be shorter than the minimum distance between images.\n\n**1. Geometry and Volume of the Ambiguous Region**\n\nThe Wigner-Seitz cell for a cubic lattice is the cube $[-L/2, L/2]^3$. A displacement vector $\\vec{r} = (r_x, r_y, r_z)$ within this cell represents the Minimum Image Convention (MIC) separation between two particles. An ambiguity arises if an alternative periodic image vector, $\\vec{r}_{\\mathrm{alt}} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{n}L$ (where $\\vec{n}$ is a non-zero integer vector), also satisfies $|\\vec{r}_{\\mathrm{alt}}| \\le r_c$.\n\nDue to the MIC, $|\\vec{r}| \\le |\\vec{r} - \\vec{n}L|$ for all $\\vec{n} \\ne \\vec{0}$. The ambiguity occurs for vectors $\\vec{r}$ in the Wigner-Seitz cell where for some $\\vec{n} \\ne \\vec{0}$, we have $|\\vec{r}_{\\mathrm{alt}}| \\le r_c$. The most likely candidates for $\\vec{n}$ are the vectors corresponding to the closest neighboring cells, e.g., $(\\pm 1, 0, 0)$, $(0, \\pm 1, 0)$, and $(0, 0, \\pm 1)$.\n\nLet's consider the condition for the image in the $+x$ direction, $\\vec{n} = (1, 0, 0)$. The alternate vector is $\\vec{r}_{\\mathrm{alt}} = (r_x-L, r_y, r_z)$. The condition for ambiguity is $|\\vec{r}_{\\mathrm{alt}}|^2 \\le r_c^2$:\n$$ (r_x-L)^2 + r_y^2 + r_z^2 \\le \\left(\\frac{L}{2} + \\Delta\\right)^2 $$\nThis inequality defines the 'ambiguous region' of MIC vectors $\\vec{r}$ associated with the $\\vec{n}=(1,0,0)$ image. This region is the portion of a sphere of radius $r_c$ centered at $(L, 0, 0)$ that lies within the Wigner-Seitz cell $[-L/2, L/2]^3$.\n\nSince $\\Delta \\ll L$, this sphere barely penetrates the Wigner-Seitz cell through its face at $r_x = L/2$. The intersection forms a thin lens-like region. To leading order, we can calculate its volume as a spherical cap. The sphere has radius $R=r_c=L/2+\\Delta$ and is cut by the plane $r_x=L/2$. The height of this cap is $h = r_c - L/2 = \\Delta$.\n\nThe volume of a spherical cap is given by $V_{\\text{cap}} = \\frac{\\pi h^2}{3}(3R - h)$. Substituting $h=\\Delta$ and $R=L/2+\\Delta$:\n$$ V_{\\text{cap}} = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta^2}{3} \\left(3\\left(\\frac{L}{2} + \\Delta\\right) - \\Delta\\right) = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta^2}{3} \\left(\\frac{3L}{2} + 2\\Delta\\right) = \\frac{\\pi L \\Delta^2}{2} + \\frac{2\\pi \\Delta^3}{3} $$\nTo leading order in the small parameter $\\Delta/L$, we keep the lowest power of $\\Delta$:\n$$ V_{\\text{cap}} \\approx \\frac{\\pi L \\Delta^2}{2} $$\nThis volume corresponds to one of the six faces of the cubic cell. The problem statement allows us to neglect edge and corner effects, which correspond to higher-order terms in $\\Delta/L$. This is justified because the radius of the circular base of the cap on a face is approximately $\\sqrt{r_c^2 - (L/2)^2} = \\sqrt{L\\Delta + \\Delta^2} \\approx \\sqrt{L\\Delta}$. Since $\\Delta \\ll L$, this radius is much smaller than $L/2$, so the caps on adjacent faces do not overlap.\n\nThe total ambiguous volume $V_{\\mathrm{amb}}$ is the sum of the volumes from the six faces:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{amb}} = 6 \\times V_{\\text{cap}} \\approx 6 \\times \\frac{\\pi L \\Delta^2}{2} = 3\\pi L \\Delta^2 $$\nThe fraction of ambiguous vectors, $f_{\\mathrm{amb}}$, is the ratio of this volume to the total volume of the Wigner-Seitz cell, $V_{\\mathrm{WS}} = L^3$:\n$$ f_{\\mathrm{amb}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{amb}}}{L^3} = \\frac{3\\pi L \\Delta^2}{L^3} = \\frac{3\\pi \\Delta^2}{L^2} $$\n\n**2. Spurious Configurational Energy Density ($\\Delta \\mathcal{E}$)**\n\nThe spurious increase in energy per unit volume, $\\Delta \\mathcal{E}$, arises from adding the potential energy of one extra periodic image for each ambiguous pair. This corresponds to an extra integral over the ambiguous volume $V_{\\mathrm{amb}}$. For a displacement $\\vec{r} \\in V_{\\mathrm{amb}}$, the extra energy is calculated using the distance to the alternate image, $|\\vec{r}_{\\mathrm{alt}}|$.\n$$ \\Delta \\mathcal{E} = \\frac{\\rho^2}{2} \\int_{V_{\\mathrm{amb}}} u(|\\vec{r}_{\\mathrm{alt}}|) g(|\\vec{r}|) d^3r $$\nWithin the thin ambiguous region, $|\\vec{r}|$ is close to $L/2$. By definition, $|\\vec{r}_{\\mathrm{alt}}|$ is also close to $L/2$ (specifically, $L/2 \\le |\\vec{r}_{\\mathrm{alt}}| \\le r_c = L/2+\\Delta$). Given the assumptions, we can approximate $g(|\\vec{r}|) \\approx 1$. For a leading-order calculation, we can also approximate the potential term as constant: $u(|\\vec{r}_{\\mathrm{alt}}|) \\approx u(L/2)$. Any corrections would involve terms like $(|\\vec{r}_{\\mathrm{alt}}|-L/2)$, which are of order $\\Delta$, and integrating them over a volume of order $L\\Delta^2$ would result in a contribution of order $\\Delta^3$, which is higher order.\n$$ \\Delta \\mathcal{E} \\approx \\frac{\\rho^2}{2} \\int_{V_{\\mathrm{amb}}} u\\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) \\cdot 1 \\cdot d^3r = \\frac{\\rho^2}{2} u\\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) V_{\\mathrm{amb}} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $V_{\\mathrm{amb}}$:\n$$ \\Delta \\mathcal{E} = \\frac{\\rho^2}{2} u\\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) (3\\pi L \\Delta^2) = \\frac{3\\pi}{2} \\rho^2 L \\Delta^2 u\\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) $$\nThe units are $(\\text{m}^{-3})^2 \\cdot \\text{m} \\cdot \\text{m}^2 \\cdot \\text{J} = \\text{J} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-3}$, as required.\n\n**3. Spurious Virial Pressure ($\\Delta p$)**\n\nSimilarly, the spurious shift in pressure $\\Delta p$ is the contribution to the virial from the extra image interactions. The virial term depends on $\\vec{r} \\cdot \\vec{F}(\\vec{r}) = -r u'(r)$. The spurious contribution uses the alternate vectors $\\vec{r}_{\\mathrm{alt}}$:\n$$ \\Delta p = -\\frac{\\rho^2}{6} \\int_{V_{\\mathrm{amb}}} |\\vec{r}_{\\mathrm{alt}}| u'(|\\vec{r}_{\\mathrm{alt}}|) g(|\\vec{r}|) d^3r $$\nUsing the same leading-order argument as for the energy, we approximate the integrand by its value at $r=L/2$:\n$$ |\\vec{r}_{\\mathrm{alt}}| u'(|\\vec{r}_{\\mathrm{alt}}|) \\approx \\frac{L}{2} u'\\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad g(|\\vec{r}|) \\approx 1 $$\n$$ \\Delta p \\approx -\\frac{\\rho^2}{6} \\int_{V_{\\mathrm{amb}}} \\frac{L}{2} u'\\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) d^3r = -\\frac{\\rho^2 L}{12} u'\\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) V_{\\mathrm{amb}} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $V_{\\mathrm{amb}}$:\n$$ \\Delta p = -\\frac{\\rho^2 L}{12} u'\\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) (3\\pi L \\Delta^2) = -\\frac{3\\pi}{12} \\rho^2 L^2 \\Delta^2 u'\\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta p = -\\frac{\\pi}{4} \\rho^2 L^2 \\Delta^2 u'\\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) $$\nThe units are $(\\text{m}^{-3})^2 \\cdot \\text{m}^2 \\cdot \\text{m}^2 \\cdot (\\text{J}/\\text{m}) = \\text{J} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-3} = \\text{Pa}$, as required.\n\nThe three derived quantities are:\n- $f_{\\mathrm{amb}} = \\frac{3\\pi \\Delta^2}{L^2}$\n- $\\Delta \\mathcal{E} = \\frac{3\\pi}{2} \\rho^2 L \\Delta^2 u\\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right)$\n- $\\Delta p = -\\frac{\\pi}{4} \\rho^2 L^2 \\Delta^2 u'\\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right)$\n\nThese are presented as a single row matrix as requested.",
