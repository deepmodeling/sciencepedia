            "problem": "An undergraduate student is exploring the foundations of Density Functional Theory (DFT). They decide to test the Hohenberg-Kohn (HK) variational principle on the simplest possible system: a single, non-relativistic hydrogen atom.\n\nThe external potential for the hydrogen atom is given by $v_{ext}(\\vec{r}) = -1/r$ in atomic units. The exact ground-state energy is known to be $E_0 = -0.5$ Hartrees. For a one-electron system, the total energy can be expressed as an exact functional of the electron density $n(\\vec{r})$:\n$$E[n] = T_s[n] + \\int v_{ext}(\\vec{r}) n(\\vec{r}) d^3\\vec{r}$$\nwhere $T_s[n]$ is the kinetic energy functional for a single non-interacting electron with density $n(\\vec{r})$.\n\nThe student performs two calculations using two different trial electron densities, $n_A(\\vec{r})$ and $n_B(\\vec{r})$.\n1.  Using the trial density $n_A(\\vec{r})$, the calculated energy is $E[n_A] = -0.46$ Hartrees.\n2.  Using the trial density $n_B(\\vec{r})$, the calculated energy is $E[n_B] = -0.53$ Hartrees.\n\nThe second result, where $E[n_B]  E_0$, appears to be a direct violation of the second Hohenberg-Kohn theorem (the variational principle), which states that any valid trial density must yield an energy greater than or equal to the true ground-state energy. Assuming the kinetic energy functional $T_s[n]$ was evaluated exactly and all numerical integrations were performed without error, what is the most fundamental theoretical reason for this paradoxical result?\n\nA. The Hohenberg-Kohn theorems are derived for many-electron systems and are known to fail for the special case of a one-electron system like hydrogen.\n\nB. The variational principle in DFT is only an approximation itself and does not guarantee a lower bound for the energy.\n\nC. The result must be due to the use of an approximate kinetic energy functional $T_s[n]$, as the exact form of this functional is unknown even for a single electron.\n\nD. The trial density $n_B(\\vec{r})$ is not a physically valid density for a one-electron system (i.e., it is not \"N-representable\"), thereby violating a crucial precondition for the variational principle to apply.\n\nE.

The inequality above shows that such a result cannot occur for any $N$-representable one-electron density. Thus, the only remaining logical possibility is that $n_{B}$ is not a physically admissible one-electron density (fails $N$-representability or, equivalently for the HK variational bound via constrained search, lies outside the domain of $F[n]$). Typical violations include lack of nonnegativity, incorrect normalization to $N=1$, or insufficient regularity such that no wavefunction $\\psi$ with $|\\psi|^{2} = n_{B}$ and finite kinetic energy exists.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is false: the HK theorems apply to any $N$, and for $N=1$ the functional is exactly known.\n- B is false: the DFT variational principle is rigorous for the constrained-search functional on its domain.\n- C is false: for $N=1$, $T_{s}[n]$ is exactly $T_{W}[n]$.\n- D is correct: the paradox arises because $n_{B}$ is not $N$-representable, invalidating the variational bound.\n- E is false: $E_{0}$ for hydrogen is exactly known and cannot be undercut by a physical density.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental theoretical reason is that the trial density $n_{B}$ is not $N$-representable.",
