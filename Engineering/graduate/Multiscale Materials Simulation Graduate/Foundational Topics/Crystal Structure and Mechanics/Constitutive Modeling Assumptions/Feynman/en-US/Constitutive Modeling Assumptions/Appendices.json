The Hill-Mandel condition stems from the Principle of Virtual Power and requires that the volume-averaged power of microscopic quantities equals the power of the corresponding macroscopic quantities. For a static problem, this implies the equality of work densities: $\\langle \\sigma \\varepsilon \\rangle = \\Sigma E$. The residual $r$ quantifies the extent to which the given microscopic fields violate this condition.\n\nTo compute $r$, we must first compute the two terms: $\\Sigma E$ and $\\langle \\sigma \\varepsilon \\rangle$.\n\n**1. Compute the macroscopic stress $\\Sigma$ and the macroscopic work density $\\Sigma E$.**\n\nThe macroscopic stress $\\Sigma$ is defined as the volume average of the microscopic stress $\\sigma(x)$:\n$$\n\\Sigma = \\langle \\sigma(x) \\rangle = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_{0}^{L} \\sigma(x) \\,dx\n$$\nSubstituting the given expression for $\\sigma(x)$:\n$$\n\\Sigma = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_{0}^{L} \\left[ \\Sigma_{0} + c \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right) + d \\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\right] dx\n$$\nWe evaluate the integral term by term:\n$$\n\\Sigma = \\frac{1}{L} \\left[ \\int_{0}^{L} \\Sigma_{0} \\,dx + c \\int_{0}^{L} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\,dx + d \\int_{0}^{L} \\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\,dx \\right]\n$$\nThe integrals of the sinusoidal functions over their periods are zero:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L} \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\,dx = \\left[ -\\frac{L}{2\\pi} \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\right]_{0}^{L} = -\\frac{L}{2\\pi}(\\cos(2\\pi) - \\cos(0)) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L} \\cos\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\,dx = \\left[ \\frac{L}{4\\pi} \\sin\\left(\\frac{4\\pi x}{L}\\right) \\right]_{0}^{L} = \\frac{L}{4\\pi}(\\sin(4\\pi) - \\sin(0)) = 0\n$$\nTherefore, the expression for $\\Sigma$ simplifies to:\n$$\n\\Sigma = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_{0}^{L} \\Sigma_{0} \\,dx = \\frac{1}{L} (\\Sigma_{0} L) = \\Sigma_{0}\n$$\nThe macroscopic work density is then:\n$$\n\\Sigma E = \\Sigma_{0} E\n$$\n\n**2.

The average of the product of any two distinct basis functions over the interval $[0, L]$ is zero.

A solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution is developed in two parts as requested.\n\nFirst, we derive the scaling of the ratio of gradient energy density to classical energy density. The classical strain energy density, let's denote it $W_{classical}$, is a function of the strain tensor $\\varepsilon$. For a linear elastic isotropic material, it takes the form $W_{classical} = \\frac{1}{2} \\lambda (\\mathrm{tr}(\\varepsilon))^2 + \\mu \\mathrm{tr}(\\varepsilon^2)$, where $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$ are the Lamé parameters. For scaling purposes, we can state that the energy density scales with the square of a characteristic strain magnitude, $|\\varepsilon|$, multiplied by a characteristic elastic modulus, which we can denote by a generic stiffness constant $C$.\n$$\nW_{classical} \\sim C |\\varepsilon|^2\n$$\nThe physical units of energy density are energy per volume, or force per area (stress), which is consistent with the units of $C$ (stress) since strain $|\\varepsilon|$ is dimensionless.\n\nNext, we consider the strain gradient energy density, $W_{gradient}$. This term is introduced to account for size effects and depends on the gradient of the strain tensor, $\\nabla \\varepsilon$. The problem states that a material length scale is introduced to ensure $W_{gradient}$ has the same physical units as $W_{classical}$. The units of strain gradient are inverse length, since $[\\nabla \\varepsilon] = [\\varepsilon]/[\\text{Length}] = 1/[\\text{Length}]$. To construct an energy density term, we must combine $|\\nabla \\varepsilon|$ with material parameters to obtain units of stress. A common formulation for the gradient energy term involves the square of the strain gradient magnitude, $|\\nabla \\varepsilon|^2$, which has units of $1/[\\text{Length}]^2$. To give this term units of stress, it must be multiplied by a factor with units of [Stress] $\\times$ [Length]$^2$. This factor is typically constructed from a material stiffness, say $C'$, and the square of an intrinsic material length scale, which we will denote as $l_m$. This length scale represents the influence of the underlying microstructure.\n$$\nW_{gradient} \\sim C' l_m^2 |\\nabla \\varepsilon|^2\n$$\nIt is physically sound to assume that the intrinsic length scale $l_m$ is related to the characteristic dimension of the microstructure, which in this problem is the average grain size $\\ell$. We therefore make the assumption that $l_m \\sim \\ell$. Furthermore, for scaling analysis, we can assume the higher-order stiffness $C'$ is of the same order of magnitude as the classical stiffness $C$. With these assumptions, the scaling for the gradient energy density becomes:\n$$\nW_{gradient} \\sim C \\ell^2 |\\nabla \\varepsilon|^2\n$$\nNow, we can find the ratio of the gradient energy density to the classical energy density:\n$$\n\\frac{W_{gradient}}{W_{classical}} \\sim \\frac{C \\ell^2 |\\nabla \\varepsilon|^2}{C |\\varepsilon|^2} = \\ell^2 \\left(\\frac{|\\nabla \\varepsilon|}{|\\varepsilon|}\\right)^2\n$$\nThe problem provides a key assumption for smooth loading conditions over the structural dimension $L$: the characteristic strain gradient magnitude is related to the characteristic strain magnitude by $|\\nabla \\varepsilon| \\sim |\\varepsilon|/L$. Substituting this into our ratio gives the desired scaling in terms of $\\ell$ and $L$:\n$$\n\\frac{W_{gradient}}{W_{classical}} \\sim \\ell^2 \\left(\\frac{|\\varepsilon|/L}{|\\varepsilon|}\\right)^2 = \\ell^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{L}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\ell}{L}\\right)^2\n$$\nThis derivation shows that the relative importance of gradient energy terms scales as the square of the ratio of the microstructural length scale to the macroscopic structural length scale.\n\nSecond, we compute the ratio $L/\\ell$ using the given values and assess the significance of strain gradient effects.\nThe given values are $\\ell = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and $L = 10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. First, we convert them to a consistent unit, for instance, meters ($m$).\n$$\n\\ell = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 10 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\n$$\nL = 10\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 10 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe ratio $L/\\ell$ is then:\n$$\n\\frac{L}{\\ell} = \\frac{10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m}}{10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}} = 10^{(-2 - (-5))} = 10^3 = 1000\n$$\nThe ratio $L/\\ell = 1000$ is much greater than $1$, which satisfies the condition for the RVE assumption ($L/\\ell \\gg 1$). This indicates that, for many purposes, a classical local constitutive model would be sufficient.\n\nTo assess the significance of strain gradient effects, we use the scaling derived previously:\n$$\n\\frac{W_{gradient}}{W_{classical}} \\sim \\left(\\frac{\\ell}{L}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{1000}\\right)^2 = (10^{-3})^2 = 10^{-6}\n$$\nThis result indicates that the energy contribution from strain gradients is approximately one-millionth of the contribution from the classical strain energy. Based on this, we can argue that strain gradient effects are expected to be entirely negligible for this component under the stated assumption of a smooth strain field (i.e., smooth loading without significant strain localization). If the loading were to induce sharp features like shear bands or plasticity near a crack tip, the local strain gradients could become very large, and the assumption $|\\nabla \\varepsilon| \\sim |\\varepsilon|/L$ would break down, potentially making gradient effects locally significant. However, for the case of smooth fields, their contribution is insignificant.\n\nThe question asks to report $L/\\ell$ as the final answer.\n$$\n\\frac{L}{\\ell} = 1000\n$$",

The problem specifies a Perzyna-type viscoplastic model with a linear viscosity law ($m=1$). For active plastic flow, the yield function $f(\\sigma, \\epsilon_p) = \\sigma - \\sigma_y(\\epsilon_p)$ is positive, and the Macaulay bracket can be removed.

Thus, $E(\\epsilon_0 - \\epsilon_{p0}) - (\\sigma_0 + H\\epsilon_{p0}) = 0$.\nWe introduce small perturbations $\\hat{u}(x,t)$ and $\\hat{\\epsilon}_p(x,t)$ such that $u(x,t) = \\epsilon_0 x + \\hat{u}(x,t)$ and $\\epsilon_p(x,t) = \\epsilon_{p0} + \\hat{\\epsilon}_p(x,t)$. Substituting these into the coupled equations and retaining only first-order terms in the perturbations yields the linearized system:\n$$\n\\rho \\, \\ddot{\\hat{u}} - E \\frac{\\partial^2 \\hat{u}}{\\partial x^2} + E \\frac{\\partial \\hat{\\epsilon}_p}{\\partial x} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{\\hat{\\epsilon}}_p + \\frac{E+H}{\\eta} \\hat{\\epsilon}_p - \\frac{E}{\\eta} \\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}}{\\partial x} = 0\n$$\nNext, we assume plane-wave solutions for the perturbations of the form $\\hat{u}(x,t) = U_0 \\exp(i(kx - \\omega t))$ and $\\hat{\\epsilon}_p(x,t) = P_0 \\exp(i(kx - \\omega t))$, where $k$ is the real wavenumber and $\\omega$ is the complex angular frequency. The derivatives are $\\ddot{\\hat{u}} = -\\omega^2 \\hat{u}$, $\\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}}{\\partial x} = ik\\hat{u}$, $\\frac{\\partial^2 \\hat{u}}{\\partial x^2} = -k^2 \\hat{u}$, $\\dot{\\hat{\\epsilon}}_p = -i\\omega \\hat{\\epsilon}_p$, and $\\frac{\\partial \\hat{\\epsilon}_p}{\\partial x} = ik\\hat{\\epsilon}_p$. Substituting these into the linearized PDEs gives an algebraic system for the amplitudes $U_0$ and $P_0$:\n$$\n(-\\rho \\omega^2 + E k^2) U_0 + (iEk) P_0 = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\left(-i\\frac{Ek}{\\eta}\\right) U_0 + \\left(-i\\omega + \\frac{E+H}{\\eta}\\right) P_0 = 0\n$$\nFor a non-trivial solution $(U_0, P_0)$, the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero:\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} E k^2 - \\rho \\omega^2 & iEk \\\\ -i\\frac{Ek}{\\eta} & \\frac{E+H}{\\eta} - i\\omega \\end{pmatrix} = 0\n$$\nEvaluating the determinant yields the dispersion relation:\n$$\n(E k^2 - \\rho \\omega^2) \\left(\\frac{E+H}{\\eta} - i\\omega\\right) - (iEk)\\left(-i\\frac{Ek}{\\eta}\\right) = 0\n$$\n$$\n(E k^2 - \\rho \\omega^2) \\left(\\frac{E+H}{\\eta} - i\\omega\\right) - \\frac{E^2 k^2}{\\eta} = 0\n$$\nExpanding and rearranging terms, we get a cubic polynomial in $\\omega$:\n$$\nE k^2 \\frac{E+H}{\\eta} - i\\omega E k^2 - \\rho \\omega^2 \\frac{E+H}{\\eta} + i\\rho\\omega^3 - \\frac{E^2 k^2}{\\eta} = 0\n$$\n$$\ni\\rho\\omega^3 - \\rho\\frac{E+H}{\\eta}\\omega^2 - iE k^2 \\omega + \\frac{E H k^2}{\\eta} = 0\n$$\nThis is the required dispersion relation linking $\\omega$ and $k$.\n\nThird, we identify the characteristic parameters. The wave speed $c$ of the underlying elastic medium corresponds to the high-frequency limit ($|\\omega| \\to \\infty$), where the viscous relaxation of plastic strain cannot occur. In this limit, the material behaves elastically. The dispersion relation for a purely elastic medium is $\\rho\\omega^2 = E k^2$, which gives a wave speed $c = \\sqrt{E/\\rho}$.\nThe linear temporal damping rate $\\beta$ of the viscoplastic relaxation can be identified from the linearized equation for $\\hat{\\epsilon}_p$. If we consider the relaxation of plastic strain under a fixed total strain (i.e., $\\frac{\\partial \\hat{u}}{\\partial x} = 0$), the equation becomes $\\dot{\\hat{\\epsilon}}_p = -\\frac{E+H}{\\eta} \\hat{\\epsilon}_p$. This is a first-order relaxation process with a rate constant $\\beta = \\frac{E+H}{\\eta}$. For damping to occur, we must have $\\beta > 0$, which requires $E+H > 0$.\nThe characteristic viscous length scale $l_v$ is defined as the ratio of these two quantities:\n$$\nl_v = \\frac{c}{\\beta} = \\frac{\\sqrt{E/\\rho}}{\\frac{E+H}{\\eta}} = \\frac{\\eta \\sqrt{E/\\rho}}{E+H} = \\frac{\\eta}{E+H}\\sqrt{\\frac{E}{\\rho}}\n$$\nThis length scale is dimensionally correct, having units of length.\n\nFinally, we discuss the effect of the viscoplastic regularization on the well-posedness of the problem in the presence of material softening ($H<0$).\nIn the rate-independent limit ($\\eta \\to 0$), for a softening material where $-E < H < 0$, the tangent modulus $E_T = \\frac{EH}{E+H}$ becomes negative. The governing equation for wave propagation becomes $\\rho \\ddot{u} - E_T \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} = 0$, which is of elliptic type for time evolution. An initial value problem for an elliptic equation is ill-posed. This manifests as an unbounded growth rate for perturbations with short wavelengths ($k \\to \\infty$), leading to pathological strain localization into a zone of zero width and severe mesh dependency in numerical solutions.\nThe introduction of the viscoplastic regularization ($\\eta > 0$) fundamentally changes the mathematical character of the problem. To analyze well-posedness, we examine the behavior of the complex frequency $\\omega(k) = \\omega_r(k) + i\\omega_i(k)$ for large wavenumbers ($k \\to \\infty$). The growth rate of a mode is given by $\\omega_i(k)$. The problem is well-posed if $\\omega_i(k)$ is bounded from above for all $k$.\nFrom the dispersion relation, an asymptotic analysis for large $k$ shows that the propagating modes behave as $\\omega(k) \\approx \\pm k \\sqrt{E/\\rho} - i \\frac{E}{2\\eta}$. The real part $\\omega_r(k)$ grows linearly with $k$, indicating a finite phase velocity $v_p = \\omega_r/k \\to \\pm\\sqrt{E/\\rho}$ in the high-wavenumber limit. The governing system thus remains hyperbolic for all $k$. The imaginary part $\\omega_i(k)$ approaches a finite, constant value of $-\\frac{E}{2\\eta}$. Since the growth rate $\\omega_i$ is bounded for all $k$, the unbounded growth of short-wavelength perturbations is suppressed. The initial value problem is therefore rendered well-posed, even for softening materials ($H<0$).\nThe regularization introduces the intrinsic length scale $l_v$, which sets the minimum width of localization bands. Numerical solutions become mesh-objective, meaning they converge to a physical solution as the mesh is refined, provided the mesh size is small enough to resolve the length scale $l_v$. The physical instability associated with softening ($H<0$ can lead to a non-propagating unstable mode with growth rate $-H/\\eta$) is not removed, but its pathological mathematical consequences are regularized.\n\nThe symbolic expression for the characteristic viscous length scale $l_v$ is therefore given as derived above.",
