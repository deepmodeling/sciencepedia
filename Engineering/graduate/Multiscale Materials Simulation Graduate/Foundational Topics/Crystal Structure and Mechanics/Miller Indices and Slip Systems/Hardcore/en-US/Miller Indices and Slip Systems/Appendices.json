For a cubic crystal system, we can define a set of primitive direct lattice vectors $\\vec{a}_1$, $\\vec{a}_2$, $\\vec{a}_3$ aligned with a Cartesian coordinate system, where $a$ is the lattice parameter:\n$$ \\vec{a}_1 = a\\hat{x} $$\n$$ \\vec{a}_2 = a\\hat{y} $$\n$$ \\vec{a}_3 = a\\hat{z} $$\nThe primitive reciprocal lattice vectors, $\\vec{b}_1$, $\\vec{b}_2$, $\\vec{b}_3$, are defined such that $\\vec{a}_i \\cdot \\vec{b}_j = 2\\pi\\delta_{ij}$, where $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. They can be constructed using the volume of the direct lattice primitive cell, $V = \\vec{a}_1 \\cdot (\\vec{a}_2 \\times \\vec{a}_3) = a^3$:\n$$ \\vec{b}_1 = 2\\pi \\frac{\\vec{a}_2 \\times \\vec{a}_3}{V} = 2\\pi \\frac{a\\hat{y} \\times a\\hat{z}}{a^3} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\hat{x} $$\n$$ \\vec{b}_2 = 2\\pi \\frac{\\vec{a}_3 \\times \\vec{a}_1}{V} = 2\\pi \\frac{a\\hat{z} \\times a\\hat{x}}{a^3} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\hat{y} $$\n$$ \\vec{b}_3 = 2\\pi \\frac{\\vec{a}_1 \\times \\vec{a}_2}{V} = 2\\pi \\frac{a\\hat{x} \\times a\\hat{y}}{a^3} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a}\\hat{z} $$\nA general vector in the reciprocal lattice, $\\vec{G}_{hkl}$, is defined as a linear combination of these primitive vectors, where the coefficients $h$, $k$, and $l$ are the Miller indices of a family of crystal planes:\n$$ \\vec{G}_{hkl} = h\\vec{b}_1 + k\\vec{b}_2 + l\\vec{b}_3 = \\frac{2\\pi}{a} (h\\hat{x} + k\\hat{y} + l\\hat{z}) $$\nThis vector $\\vec{G}_{hkl}$ is, by construction, normal to the $(hkl)$ crystallographic planes. A fundamental property of the reciprocal lattice is that the magnitude of the shortest reciprocal lattice vector normal to the $(hkl)$ planes is related to the interplanar spacing $d_{hkl}$ by:\n$$ |\\vec{G}_{hkl}| = \\frac{2\\pi}{d_{hkl}} $$\nWe calculate the magnitude of $\\vec{G}_{hkl}$ from its vector components:\n$$ |\\vec{G}_{hkl}| = \\left| \\frac{2\\pi}{a} (h\\hat{x} + k\\hat{y} + l\\hat{z}) \\right| = \\frac{2\\pi}{a} \\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2} $$\nEquating the two expressions for $|\\vec{G}_{hkl}|$:\n$$ \\frac{2\\pi}{d_{hkl}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{a} \\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2} $$\nSolving for $d_{hkl}$ gives the general formula for interplanar spacing in a cubic crystal:\n$$ d_{hkl} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}} $$\nThis formula is valid for all cubic Bravais lattices (SC, BCC, FCC), as it depends only on the cubic symmetry and the lattice parameter $a$ of the conventional unit cell.\n\nNext, we compute the interplanar spacing for the specified planes using $a = 0.36 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$.\n\nFor the $(210)$ plane, the Miller indices are $h=2$, $k=1$, $l=0$.\n$$ d_{210} = \\frac{0.36}{\\sqrt{2^2 + 1^2 + 0^2}} = \\frac{0.36}{\\sqrt{4 + 1 + 0}} = \\frac{0.36}{\\sqrt{5}} \\ \\mathrm{nm} \\approx 0.160997 \\ \\mathrm{nm} $$\nRounded to four significant figures, $d_{210} = 0.1610 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$.\n\nFor the $(\\bar{1}12)$ plane, the Miller indices are $h=-1$, $k=1$, $l=2$. The bar indicates a negative index.\n$$ d_{\\bar{1}12} = \\frac{0.36}{\\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 1^2 + 2^2}} = \\frac{0.36}{\\sqrt{1 + 1 + 4}} = \\frac{0.36}{\\sqrt{6}} \\ \\mathrm{nm} \\approx 0.146969 \\ \\mathrm{nm} $$\nRounded to four significant figures, $d_{\\bar{1}12} = 0.1470 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$.\n\nFor the $(3\\bar{1}\\bar{1})$ plane, the Miller indices are $h=3$, $k=-1$, $l=-1$.\n$$ d_{3\\bar{1}\\bar{1}} = \\frac{0.36}{\\sqrt{3^2 + (-1)^2 + (-1)^2}} = \\frac{0.36}{\\sqrt{9 + 1 + 1}} = \\frac{0.36}{\\sqrt{11}} \\ \\mathrm{nm} \\approx 0.108542 \\ \\mathrm{nm} $$\nRounded to four significant figures, $d_{3\\bar{1}\\bar{1}} = 0.1085 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$.\n\nFinally, we rank these planes from largest to smallest interplanar spacing.\n1.  $d_{210} = 0.1610 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$\n2.  $d_{\\bar{1}12} = 0.1470 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$\n3.  $d_{3\\bar{1}\\bar{1}} = 0.1085 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$\nThe order is $d_{210} > d_{\\bar{1}12} > d_{3\\bar{1}\\bar{1}}$.\nThe problem assigns ordinal positions: $1$ for $(210)$, $2$ for $(\\bar{1}12)$, and $3$ for $(3\\bar{1}\\bar{1})$.

            "solution": "The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded. It presents a standard exercise in crystallography, providing all necessary definitions, conditions, and constraints to arrive at a unique, verifiable answer. The terminology and physical principles, such as Miller indices, crystallographic families $\\{111\\}$ and $\\langle 110\\rangle$ for Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) slip systems, and the geometric incidence condition, are all factually correct and standard in materials science. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions or ambiguities. Therefore, a solution can be systematically derived.\n\nThe task is to enumerate all unique slip systems in an FCC crystal, where slip systems belong to the $\\{111\\}\\langle 110\\rangle$ family. A slip system is defined as a pair of a slip plane and a slip direction lying within that plane. The problem specifies equivalence relations for planes and directions that must be used for counting unique systems.\n\nFirst, we identify the unique slip planes from the $\\{111\\}$ family. In a cubic crystal, this family includes all planes with Miller indices that are permutations of $(\\pm 1, \\pm 1, \\pm 1)$. This generates $2^3 = 8$ specific planes: $(1\\,1\\,1)$, $(1\\,1\\,\\bar{1})$, $(1\\,\\bar{1}\\,1)$, $(\\bar{1}\\,1\\,1)$, $(\\bar{1}\\,\\bar{1}\\,\\bar{1})$, $(\\bar{1}\\,\\bar{1}\\,1)$, $(\\bar{1}\\,1\\,\\bar{1})$, and $(1\\,\\bar{1}\\,\\bar{1})$. The problem states that the planes $(h\\,k\\,l)$ and $(-h\\,-k\\,-l)$ are to be treated as the same plane. This creates $4$ distinct sets of planes. We choose one representative from each set, for example:\n$P_1 = (1\\,1\\,1)$\n$P_2 = (1\\,1\\,\\bar{1})$\n$P_3 = (1\\,\\bar{1}\\,1)$\n$P_4 = (\\bar{1}\\,1\\,1)$\nThere are $4$ unique slip planes in the $\\{111\\}$ family.\n\nSecond, we consider the slip directions from the $\\langle 110\\rangle$ family. This family includes all directions with Miller indices that are permutations of $(\\pm 1, \\pm 1, 0)$. This generates $12$ specific directions: $[1\\,1\\,0]$, $[\\bar{1}\\,\\bar{1}\\,0]$, $[1\\,\\bar{1}\\,0]$, $[\\bar{1}\\,1\\,0]$, $[1\\,0\\,1]$, $[\\bar{1}\\,0\\,\\bar{1}]$, $[1\\,0\\,\\bar{1}]$, $[\\bar{1}\\,0\\,1]$, $[0\\,1\\,1]$, $[0\\,\\bar{1}\\,\\bar{1}]$, $[0\\,1\\,\\bar{1}]$, and $[0\\,\\bar{1}\\,1]$. The problem states that directions $[u\\,v\\,w]$ and $[-u\\,-v\\,-w]$ represent the same crystallographic line and that inversion does not create a new slip system. This means we are counting pairs of (plane, line). The $12$ directions form $6$ unique lines.\n\nThird, for each of the $4$ unique planes, we identify the slip directions that lie within it using the incidence condition $h u + k v + l w = 0$.\n\nFor plane $P_1 = (1\\,1\\,1)$, the condition is $u + v + w = 0$. We test the directions from the $\\langle 110\\rangle$ family:\n- $[1\\,\\bar{1}\\,0]: (1)(1)+(1)(-1)+(1)(0)=0$. Valid.\n- $[\\bar{1}\\,1\\,0]: (1)(-1)+(1)(1)+(1)(0)=0$. Valid.

For the $(1\\,1\\,1)$ plane, there are $3$ distinct slip lines: $[1\\,\\bar{1}\\,0]$, $[1\\,0\\,\\bar{1}]$, and $[0\\,1\\,\\bar{1}]$.

Thus, the Schmid factor is $0$ for all three slip systems on this plane. The tensile axis lies within this plane.\n\nWe now compare the calculated values of the Schmid factor to find the maximum. The non-zero values are:\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{14}$, $-\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{7}$, $\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{14}$, $\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{14}$, $-\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{21}$, $\\frac{5\\sqrt{6}}{42}$, $\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{7}$, $\\frac{4\\sqrt{6}}{21}$, $-\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{21}$.\nTo compare these values, we can express them with a common denominator of $42$:\n$\\frac{3\\sqrt{6}}{42}$, $-\\frac{6\\sqrt{6}}{42}$, $\\frac{3\\sqrt{6}}{42}$, $\\frac{3\\sqrt{6}}{42}$, $-\\frac{2\\sqrt{6}}{42}$, $\\frac{5\\sqrt{6}}{42}$, $\\frac{6\\sqrt{6}}{42}$, $\\frac{8\\sqrt{6}}{42}$, $-\\frac{2\\sqrt{6}}{42}$.\nThe coefficients of $\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{42}$ are $3$, $-6$, $3$, $3$, $-2$, $5$, $6$, $8$, $-2$. The maximum coefficient is $8$.\nThe maximum Schmid factor is therefore:\n$$m_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{8\\sqrt{6}}{42} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{6}}{21}$$\nThis maximum value corresponds to the slip system with plane $(\\bar{1}11)$ and direction $[101]$.",
