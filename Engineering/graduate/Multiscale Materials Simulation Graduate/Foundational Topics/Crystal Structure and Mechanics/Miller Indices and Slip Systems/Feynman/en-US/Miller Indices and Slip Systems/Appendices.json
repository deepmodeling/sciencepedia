            "problem": "Consider a Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) crystal. In cubic crystals, a crystallographic plane with Miller indices $(h\\,k\\,l)$ has a unit normal parallel to the crystallographic direction $[h\\,k\\,l]$, and a crystallographic direction $[u\\,v\\,w]$ lies in that plane if and only if $h u + k v + l w = 0$.

            "solution": "The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded. It presents a standard exercise in crystallography, providing all necessary definitions, conditions, and constraints to arrive at a unique, verifiable answer. The terminology and physical principles, such as Miller indices, crystallographic families $\\{111\\}$ and $\\langle 110\\rangle$ for Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) slip systems, and the geometric incidence condition, are all factually correct and standard in materials science. The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions or ambiguities. Therefore, a solution can be systematically derived.\n\nThe task is to enumerate all unique slip systems in an FCC crystal, where slip systems belong to the $\\{111\\}\\langle 110\\rangle$ family. A slip system is defined as a pair of a slip plane and a slip direction lying within that plane. The problem specifies equivalence relations for planes and directions that must be used for counting unique systems.\n\nFirst, we identify the unique slip planes from the $\\{111\\}$ family. In a cubic crystal, this family includes all planes with Miller indices that are permutations of $(\\pm 1, \\pm 1, \\pm 1)$. This generates $2^3 = 8$ specific planes: $(111)$, $(11\\bar{1})$, $(1\\bar{1}1)$, $(\\bar{1}11)$, $(\\bar{1}\\bar{1}\\bar{1})$, $(\\bar{1}\\bar{1}1)$, $(\\bar{1}1\\bar{1})$, and $(1\\bar{1}\\bar{1})$. The problem states that the planes $(hkl)$ and $(-h-k-l)$ are to be treated as the same plane. This creates $4$ distinct sets of planes. We choose one representative from each set, for example:\n$P_1 = (111)$\n$P_2 = (11\\bar{1})$\n$P_3 = (1\\bar{1}1)$\n$P_4 = (\\bar{1}11)$\nThere are $4$ unique slip planes in the $\\{111\\}$ family.\n\nSecond, we consider the slip directions from the $\\langle 110\\rangle$ family. This family includes all directions with Miller indices that are permutations of $(\\pm 1, \\pm 1, 0)$. This generates $12$ specific directions: $[110]$, $[\\bar{1}\\bar{1}0]$, $[1\\bar{1}0]$, $[\\bar{1}10]$, $[101]$, $[\\bar{1}0\\bar{1}]$, $[10\\bar{1}]$, $[\\bar{1}01]$, $[011]$, $[0\\bar{1}\\bar{1}]$, $[01\\bar{1}]$, and $[0\\bar{1}1]$. The problem states that directions $[uvw]$ and $[-u-v-w]$ represent the same crystallographic line and that inversion does not create a new slip system. This means we are counting pairs of (plane, line). The $12$ directions form $6$ unique lines.\n\nThird, for each of the $4$ unique planes, we identify the slip directions that lie within it using the incidence condition $h u + k v + l w = 0$.\n\nFor plane $P_1 = (111)$, the condition is $u + v + w = 0$. We test the directions from the $\\langle 110\\rangle$ family:\n- $[1\\bar{1}0]: (1)(1)+(1)(-1)+(1)(0)=0$. Valid.\n- $[\\bar{1}10]: (1)(-1)+(1)(1)+(1)(0)=0$. Valid. This direction is antiparallel to $[1\\bar{1}0]$.\n- $[10\\bar{1}]: (1)(1)+(1)(0)+(1)(-1)=0$. Valid.\n- $[\\bar{1}01]: (1)(-1)+(1)(0)+(1)(1)=0$. Valid.

This direction is antiparallel to $[01\\bar{1}]$.\nThe other $6$ directions do not satisfy the condition. For the $(111)$ plane, there are $3$ distinct slip lines: $[1\\bar{1}0]$, $[10\\bar{1}]$, and $[01\\bar{1}]$. This gives $3$ slip systems.\n\nFor plane $P_2 = (11\\bar{1})$, the condition is $u + v - w = 0$.\n- $[1\\bar{1}0]: (1)(1)+(1)(-1)+(-1)(0)=0$. Valid. (Line 1)\n- $[\\bar{1}10]: (1)(-1)+(1)(1)+(-1)(0)=0$. Valid. (Antiparallel to the above)\n- $[101]: (1)(1)+(1)(0)+(-1)(1)=0$. Valid. (Line 2)\n- $[\\bar{1}0\\bar{1}]: (1)(-1)+(1)(0)+(-1)(-1)=0$.

Valid. (Antiparallel to the above)\nFor the $(1\\bar{1}1)$ plane, there are $3$ distinct slip lines, represented by $[110]$, $[10\\bar{1}]$, and $[011]$. This gives $3$ slip systems.\n\nFor plane $P_4 = (\\bar{1}11)$, the condition is $-u + v + w = 0$.\n- $[110]: (-1)(1)+(1)(1)+(1)(0)=0$. Valid. (Line 1)\n- $[\\bar{1}\\bar{1}0]: (-1)(-1)+(1)(-1)+(1)(0)=0$. Valid. (Antiparallel to the above)\n- $[101]: (-1)(1)+(1)(0)+(1)(1)=0$. Valid.

(Line 3)\n- $[0\\bar{1}1]: (-1)(0)+(1)(-1)+(1)(1)=0$. Valid. (Antiparallel to the above)\nFor the $(\\bar{1}11)$ plane, there are $3$ distinct slip lines, represented by $[110]$, $[101]$, and $[01\\bar{1}]$. This gives $3$ slip systems.\n\nFinally, we sum the number of unique slip systems (plane-line pairs). Each of the $4$ unique planes contains $3$ unique slip lines. The total count $S$ is the product of the number of planes and the number of directions per plane.\n$S = (\\text{number of unique planes}) \\times (\\text{number of unique slip lines per plane})$\n$S = 4 \\times 3 = 12$\nTherefore, there are $12$ unique slip systems in the $\\{111\\}\\langle 110\\rangle$ family for an FCC crystal under the given equivalence conditions.",

Angle between Directions $[123]$ and $[\\bar{1}10]$**\n\nLet the two direction vectors be $\\mathbf{d}_1$ corresponding to $[123]$ and $\\mathbf{d}_2$ corresponding to $[\\bar{1}10]$. Using the definition of a direction vector:\n$$\n\\mathbf{d}_1 = 1\\mathbf{a}_1 + 2\\mathbf{a}_2 + 3\\mathbf{a}_3 = a(1\\hat{x} + 2\\hat{y} + 3\\hat{z})\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{d}_2 = -1\\mathbf{a}_1 + 1\\mathbf{a}_2 + 0\\mathbf{a}_3 = a(-1\\hat{x} + 1\\hat{y} + 0\\hat{z})\n$$\nThe angle $\\theta_{dir}$ between these two vectors is found using the dot product formula: $\\cos(\\theta_{dir}) = \\frac{\\mathbf{d}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{d}_2}{|\\mathbf{d}_1| |\\mathbf{d}_2|}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the dot product:\n$$\n\\mathbf{d}_1 \\cdot \\mathbf{d}_2 = a(1\\hat{x} + 2\\hat{y} + 3\\hat{z}) \\cdot a(-1\\hat{x} + 1\\hat{y} + 0\\hat{z}) = a^2 \\left( (1)(-1) + (2)(1) + (3)(0) \\right) = a^2(-1 + 2 + 0) = a^2\n$$\nNext, we compute the magnitudes of the vectors:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{d}_1| = \\sqrt{(a)^2 + (2a)^2 + (3a)^2} = a\\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2} = a\\sqrt{1+4+9} = a\\sqrt{14}\n$$\n$$\n|\\mathbf{d}_2| = \\sqrt{(-a)^2 + (a)^2 + (0a)^2} = a\\sqrt{(-1)^2 + 1^2 + 0^2} = a\\sqrt{1+1+0} = a\\sqrt{2}\n$$\nNow, we compute the cosine of the angle:\n$$\n\\cos(\\theta_{dir}) = \\frac{a^2}{(a\\sqrt{14})(a\\sqrt{2})} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{28}} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{7}}\n$$\nThe angle in degrees is:\n$$\n\\theta_{dir} = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{7}}\\right) \\approx 79.1066^\\circ\n$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, $\\theta_{dir} \\approx 79.11^\\circ$.\n\n**2. Angle between Planes $(123)$ and $(\\bar{1}10)$**\n\nThe angle between two planes is defined as the angle between their normal vectors. Let the normal vectors be $\\mathbf{G}_1$ for plane $(123)$ and $\\mathbf{G}_2$ for plane $(\\bar{1}10)$.

Thus, the angle is also:\n$$\n\\theta_{plane} = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{7}}\\right) \\approx 79.1066^\\circ\n$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, $\\theta_{plane} \\approx 79.11^\\circ$.\n\n**3. Conceptual Distinction between Directions and Planes**\n\nThe problem requires an explicit explanation for why a direction $[hkl]$ and a plane $(hkl)$ are not equivalent objects.\n- A direction $[uvw]$ is a vector $\\mathbf{d}$ in **direct space**, representing a line of atoms or a specific translation vector within the crystal lattice.\n- A plane $(hkl)$ is a set of parallel planes of atoms in **direct space**. This geometric object is represented by its normal vector $\\mathbf{G}$ in **reciprocal space**.\n\nThe two are fundamentally different kinds of objects: one is a one-dimensional line (or vector), the other is a two-dimensional surface (or a family of them).\n\nThe calculation above shows that for a cubic crystal, the angle between two directions $[u_1v_1w_1]$ and $[u_2v_2w_2]$ is the same as the angle between two planes $(u_1v_1w_1)$ and $(u_2v_2w_2)$. This occurs because of a special property of cubic symmetry. In a cubic system, the direct basis vectors $\\mathbf{a}_i$ are mutually orthogonal. This leads to the reciprocal basis vectors $\\mathbf{b}_i$ being parallel to their direct counterparts, i.e., $\\mathbf{b}_i \\propto \\mathbf{a}_i$. Consequently, the direct space vector $\\mathbf{d} = u\\mathbf{a}_1 + v\\mathbf{a}_2 + w\\mathbf{a}_3$ is parallel to the reciprocal space vector $\\mathbf{G} = u\\mathbf{b}_1 + v\\mathbf{b}_2 + w\\mathbf{b}_3$.\n\nThis parallelism is a special case and does **not** hold for non-cubic crystal systems (e.g., monoclinic, triclinic), where the basis vectors are not mutually orthogonal. In a general lattice, $\\mathbf{a}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{a}_j \\neq a^2\\delta_{ij}$, which implies that $\\mathbf{b}_i$ is not necessarily parallel to $\\mathbf{a}_i$. Therefore, for a general crystal, the direction vector $[hkl]$ is not parallel to the plane normal for $(hkl)$, and the angle between two directions is not equal to the angle between two planes with the same Miller indices. This highlights that the equivalence of the angles is a mathematical artifact of the high symmetry of the cubic lattice, not a sign of the physical equivalence of the direction and plane objects themselves.\n\n**Final Numerical Answer**\nBoth computed angles are $\\arccos\\left(\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{7}}\\right) \\approx 79.1066^\\circ$. Rounding to $4$ significant figures gives $79.11^\\circ$ for both.\nAngle between directions: $79.11$\nAngle between planes: $79.11$",

Slip Direction $[10\\bar{1}]$: $\\vec{d} = [1,0,-1]$. $\\vec{S} \\cdot \\vec{d} = 1(1)+2(0)+3(-1)=-2$.\n       $m = \\frac{6 \\cdot (-2)}{14\\sqrt{6}} = \\frac{-12}{14\\sqrt{6}} = \\frac{-6}{7\\sqrt{6}} = -\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{7}$.\n    c. Slip Direction $[0\\bar{1}1]$: $\\vec{d} = [0,-1,1]$. $\\vec{S} \\cdot \\vec{d} = 1(0)+2(-1)+3(1)=1$.\n       $m = \\frac{6 \\cdot 1}{14\\sqrt{6}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{14}$.\n\n2.  **Slip Plane $(1\\bar{1}1)$**: $\\vec{n} = [1,-1,1]$. $\\vec{S} \\cdot \\vec{n} = 1(1) + 2(-1) + 3(1) = 2$.\n    The slip directions $[uvw]$ must satisfy $u-v+w=0$.\n    a. Slip Direction $[110]$: $\\vec{d} = [1,1,0]$. $\\vec{S} \\cdot \\vec{d} = 1(1)+2(1)+3(0)=3$.\n       $m = \\frac{2 \\cdot 3}{14\\sqrt{6}} = \\frac{6}{14\\sqrt{6}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{14}$.\n    b. Slip Direction $[10\\bar{1}]$: $\\vec{d} = [1,0,-1]$. $\\vec{S} \\cdot \\vec{d} = -2$.\n       $m = \\frac{2 \\cdot (-2)}{14\\sqrt{6}} = \\frac{-4}{14\\sqrt{6}} = -\\frac{2}{7\\sqrt{6}} = -\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{21}$.\n    c. Slip Direction $[011]$: $\\vec{d} = [0,1,1]$. $\\vec{S} \\cdot \\vec{d} = 1(0)+2(1)+3(1)=5$.\n       $m = \\frac{2 \\cdot 5}{14\\sqrt{6}} = \\frac{10}{14\\sqrt{6}} = \\frac{5}{7\\sqrt{6}} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{6}}{42}$.\n\n3.  **Slip Plane $(\\bar{1}11)$**: $\\vec{n} = [-1,1,1]$. $\\vec{S} \\cdot \\vec{n} = 1(-1) + 2(1) + 3(1) = 4$.\n    The slip directions $[uvw]$ must satisfy $-u+v+w=0$.\n    a. Slip Direction $[110]$: $\\vec{d} = [1,1,0]$. $\\vec{S} \\cdot \\vec{d} = 3$.\n       $m = \\frac{4 \\cdot 3}{14\\sqrt{6}} = \\frac{12}{14\\sqrt{6}} = \\frac{6}{7\\sqrt{6}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{7}$.\n    b. Slip Direction $[101]$: $\\vec{d} = [1,0,1]$. $\\vec{S} \\cdot \\vec{d} = 1(1)+2(0)+3(1)=4$.\n       $m = \\frac{4 \\cdot 4}{14\\sqrt{6}} = \\frac{16}{14\\sqrt{6}} = \\frac{8}{7\\sqrt{6}} = \\frac{8\\sqrt{6}}{42} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{6}}{21}$.\n    c. Slip Direction $[01\\bar{1}]$: $\\vec{d} = [0,1,-1]$. $\\vec{S} \\cdot \\vec{d} = 1(0)+2(1)+3(-1)=-1$.\n       $m = \\frac{4 \\cdot (-1)}{14\\sqrt{6}} = \\frac{-4}{14\\sqrt{6}} = -\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{21}$.\n\n4.  **Slip Plane $(11\\bar{1})$**: $\\vec{n} = [1,1,-1]$. $\\vec{S} \\cdot \\vec{n} = 1(1) + 2(1) + 3(-1) = 0$.\n    Since the dot product of $\\vec{S}$ and $\\vec{n}$ is zero, the angle $\\phi$ is $90^\\circ$, making $\\cos(\\phi)=0$. Thus, the Schmid factor is $0$ for all three slip systems on this plane. The tensile axis lies within this plane.\n\nWe now compare the calculated values of the Schmid factor to find the maximum. The non-zero values are:\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{14}$, $-\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{7}$, $\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{14}$, $\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{14}$, $-\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{21}$, $\\frac{5\\sqrt{6}}{42}$, $\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{7}$, $\\frac{4\\sqrt{6}}{21}$, $-\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{21}$.\nTo compare these values, we can express them with a common denominator of $42$:\n$\\frac{3\\sqrt{6}}{42}$, $-\\frac{6\\sqrt{6}}{42}$, $\\frac{3\\sqrt{6}}{42}$, $\\frac{3\\sqrt{6}}{42}$, $-\\frac{2\\sqrt{6}}{42}$, $\\frac{5\\sqrt{6}}{42}$, $\\frac{6\\sqrt{6}}{42}$, $\\frac{8\\sqrt{6}}{42}$, $-\\frac{2\\sqrt{6}}{42}$.\nThe coefficients of $\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{42}$ are $3$, $-6$, $3$, $3$, $-2$, $5$, $6$, $8$, $-2$. The maximum coefficient is $8$.\nThe maximum Schmid factor is therefore:\n$$m_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{8\\sqrt{6}}{42} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{6}}{21}$$\nThis maximum value corresponds to the slip system with plane $(\\bar{1}11)$ and direction $[101]$.",
