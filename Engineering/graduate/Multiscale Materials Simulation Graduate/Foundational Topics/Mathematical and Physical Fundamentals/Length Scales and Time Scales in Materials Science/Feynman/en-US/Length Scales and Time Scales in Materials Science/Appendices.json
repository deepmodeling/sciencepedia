The integration time step must be small enough to capture the fastest atomic motions, typically vibrations on the order of femtoseconds ($10^{-15}$ s), while the total simulation must be long enough to observe the phenomenon of interest. This exercise provides a quantitative link between these scales by asking you to calculate the expected number of vibrations within a typical nanosecond-scale simulation, reinforcing your intuition for the immense number of microscopic events underlying macroscopic observations.

The collective lattice vibrations can be described by the Debye model, in which the vibrational normal-mode spectrum has a cutoff angular frequency $\\omega_{D}$ corresponding to a Debye frequency $f_{D} = \\omega_{D}/(2\\pi)$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the expected number of oscillation cycles, $\\langle N \\rangle$, for a randomly chosen vibrational mode within a simulation time $t$. The selection of a mode is governed by a probability distribution derived from the Debye model's density of states. The derivation proceeds from first principles as follows.\n\nFirst, we must establish the normalized probability density function, $P(\\omega)$, for the angular frequency $\\omega$ of a vibrational mode. The problem states that modes are sampled proportionally to the vibrational density of states, $g(\\omega)$, which is given as $g(\\omega) \\propto \\omega^2$ for angular frequencies in the range $0 \\leq \\omega \\leq \\omega_D$. Let $K$ be the normalization constant. The probability density function is then:\n$$\nP(\\omega) = \\begin{cases} K\\omega^2 & \\text{for } 0 \\leq \\omega \\leq \\omega_D \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe constant $K$ is determined by the normalization condition that the total probability must be equal to $1$.\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} P(\\omega) d\\omega = \\int_{0}^{\\omega_D} K\\omega^2 d\\omega = 1\n$$\nWe evaluate the integral:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\omega_D} K\\omega^2 d\\omega = K \\left[ \\frac{\\omega^3}{3} \\right]_{0}^{\\omega_D} = K \\frac{\\omega_D^3}{3}\n$$\nSetting this equal to $1$ gives the value of $K$:\n$$\nK \\frac{\\omega_D^3}{3} = 1 \\implies K = \\frac{3}{\\omega_D^3}\n$$\nThus, the normalized probability density function for the angular frequency is:\n$$\nP(\\omega) = \\frac{3\\omega^2}{\\omega_D^3} \\quad \\text{for } 0 \\leq \\omega \\leq \\omega_D\n$$\nNext, we must define the quantity whose expectation value we wish to calculate. This is the number of oscillation cycles, $N$, that a mode with angular frequency $\\omega$ completes in a total time $t$. A mode with frequency $f$ completes $f$ cycles per unit time. Over a duration $t$, the number of cycles is $N = f \\cdot t$. The relationship between angular frequency $\\omega$ and frequency $f$ is $\\omega = 2\\pi f$, which implies $f = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi}$. Therefore, the number of cycles as a function of $\\omega$ is:\n$$\nN(\\omega) = \\frac{\\omega t}{2\\pi}\n$$\nThe expected number of cycles, $\\langle N \\rangle$, is the average of $N(\\omega)$ weighted by the probability distribution $P(\\omega)$. It is calculated by the integral:\n$$\n\\langle N \\rangle = \\int_{0}^{\\omega_D} N(\\omega) P(\\omega) d\\omega\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $N(\\omega)$ and $P(\\omega)$:\n$$\n\\langle N \\rangle = \\int_{0}^{\\omega_D} \\left(\\frac{\\omega t}{2\\pi}\\right) \\left(\\frac{3\\omega^2}{\\omega_D^3}\\right) d\\omega\n$$\nWe can pull the constants out of the integral:\n$$\n\\langle N \\rangle = \\frac{3t}{2\\pi \\omega_D^3} \\int_{0}^{\\omega_D} \\omega^3 d\\omega\n$$\nNow, we evaluate the integral of $\\omega^3$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\omega_D} \\omega^3 d\\omega = \\left[ \\frac{\\omega^4}{4} \\right]_{0}^{\\omega_D} = \\frac{\\omega_D^4}{4}\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $\\langle N \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\langle N \\rangle = \\frac{3t}{2\\pi \\omega_D^3} \\left(\\frac{\\omega_D^4}{4}\\right) = \\frac{3t\\omega_D}{8\\pi}\n$$\nThe problem provides the characteristic Debye frequency $f_D = 10^{13}\\ \\text{Hz}$, which is related to the cutoff angular frequency by $\\omega_D = 2\\pi f_D$. We substitute this into our expression for $\\langle N \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\langle N \\rangle = \\frac{3t(2\\pi f_D)}{8\\pi} = \\frac{3tf_D}{4}\n$$\nThis is the final symbolic expression for the expected number of cycles.

            "problem": "A single straight edge dislocation is embedded along the $z$-axis in an otherwise homogeneous, isotropic, linear elastic crystal. The Burgers vector has magnitude $b$ and lies along the $x$-direction. There exists a defect core of radius $a$ around the dislocation line in which atomistic effects dominate and classical continuum elasticity is not valid. Outside the core, the stress magnitude decays with radial distance $r$ from the line and exhibits strong gradients near the core. You aim to compute the stress field with the Finite Element Method (FEM) in a circular domain of radius $R \\gg a$, using piecewise-linear interpolation, under quasi-static conditions.\n\nUse only the following well-tested facts as starting points: (i) outside the core, linear elasticity is applicable, (ii) the dominant stress component near a straight dislocation scales in magnitude as $\\sigma(r) \\sim C/r$ for some constant $C$ dependent on elastic constants and $b$, and (iii) continuum predictions in the core region $r \\lesssim a$ are not reliable. You wish to guarantee that, within each element, the relative variation of stress across the element does not exceed a prescribed tolerance $\\varepsilon \\in (0,1)$.\n\nWhich of the following mesh design strategies most appropriately contrasts the defect core scale with continuum resolution requirements and provides a sound mesh criterion that ensures accurate stress fields?\n\nA. Introduce an inner exclusion boundary at $r_{0} = c\\,a$ with $c = \\mathcal{O}(1)$ to remove the core from the continuum domain and represent its effect via appropriate inner-boundary conditions or eigenstrain.

The goal is to keep the relative variation of stress, $\\Delta\\sigma/\\sigma$, within an element smaller than a tolerance $\\varepsilon$. For an element of size $h(r)$ at a radial position $r$, the stress variation can be approximated as $\\Delta\\sigma \\approx |d\\sigma/dr| h(r)$. Given $\\sigma(r) \\sim C/r$, its derivative is $|d\\sigma/dr| \\sim C/r^2$. The relative variation is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta\\sigma}{\\sigma(r)} \\approx \\frac{(C/r^2) h(r)}{C/r} = \\frac{h(r)}{r} $$\nTo satisfy the tolerance, we must have $h(r)/r \\le \\varepsilon$, which leads to the mesh size criterion:\n$$ h(r) \\le \\varepsilon r $$\nThis means the mesh must be radially graded, with element size proportional to the distance from the core.\n\nSecond, the problem states that continuum elasticity is not valid in the core region ($r \\lesssim a$). Attempting to model this region with FEM would lead to a physically meaningless solution converging to the non-physical $1/r$ singularity at $r=0$. The correct approach is to exclude this region from the continuum domain, for example by creating an inner boundary at $r_0 = \\mathcal{O}(a)$, and applying the effect of the dislocation through boundary conditions or an equivalent method.\n\nCombining these two points leads to the strategy outlined in option A. Let's analyze all options:\n\n**A.** This option correctly identifies both key requirements: (1) excluding the non-physical core region and (2) using a radially graded mesh with the correct criterion $h(r) \\le \\varepsilon r$ to control relative error in the valid continuum region. This is the physically and numerically sound approach.\n\n**B.** This option is incorrect because it attempts to resolve the core with a continuum model, which is physically invalid. Furthermore, a uniform mesh is highly inefficient for a field with a $1/r$ singularity.\n\n**C.** This option is incorrect because the stress and its gradients are highest near the core, not the far-field boundary. A mesh based on the outer radius $R$ would be far too coarse to resolve the stress field accurately where it changes most rapidly.\n\n**D.** This option is incorrect because it proposes modeling the invalid core region. Additionally, it uses an error estimate based on the second derivative, which does not directly correspond to the problem's stated goal of controlling the first-order relative variation of stress across an element, leading to a different criterion.\n\nTherefore, option A provides the most appropriate and comprehensive strategy.",
