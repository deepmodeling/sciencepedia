            "solution": "The problem asks for the expected number of oscillation cycles, $\\langle N \\rangle$, for a randomly chosen vibrational mode within a simulation time $t$. The selection of a mode is governed by a probability distribution derived from the Debye model's density of states. The derivation proceeds from first principles as follows.\n\nFirst, we must establish the normalized probability density function, $P(\\omega)$, for the angular frequency $\\omega$ of a vibrational mode. The problem states that modes are sampled proportionally to the vibrational density of states, $g(\\omega)$, which is given as $g(\\omega) \\propto \\omega^2$ for angular frequencies in the range $0 \\leq \\omega \\leq \\omega_D$. Let $K$ be the normalization constant. The probability density function is then:\n$$\nP(\\omega) = \\begin{cases} K\\omega^2  \\text{for } 0 \\leq \\omega \\leq \\omega_D \\\\ 0  \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n$$\nThe constant $K$ is determined by the normalization condition that the total probability must be equal to $1$.\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} P(\\omega) d\\omega = \\int_{0}^{\\omega_D} K\\omega^2 d\\omega = 1\n$$\nWe evaluate the integral:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\omega_D} K\\omega^2 d\\omega = K \\left[ \\frac{\\omega^3}{3} \\right]_{0}^{\\omega_D} = K \\frac{\\omega_D^3}{3}\n$$\nSetting this equal to $1$ gives the value of $K$:\n$$\nK \\frac{\\omega_D^3}{3} = 1 \\implies K = \\frac{3}{\\omega_D^3}\n$$\nThus, the normalized probability density function for the angular frequency is:\n$$\nP(\\omega) = \\frac{3\\omega^2}{\\omega_D^3} \\quad \\text{for } 0 \\leq \\omega \\leq \\omega_D\n$$\nNext, we must define the quantity whose expectation value we wish to calculate. This is the number of oscillation cycles, $N$, that a mode with angular frequency $\\omega$ completes in a total time $t$. A mode with frequency $f$ completes $f$ cycles per unit time. Over a duration $t$, the number of cycles is $N = f \\cdot t$. The relationship between angular frequency $\\omega$ and frequency $f$ is $\\omega = 2\\pi f$, which implies $f = \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi}$. Therefore, the number of cycles as a function of $\\omega$ is:\n$$\nN(\\omega) = \\frac{\\omega t}{2\\pi}\n$$\nThe expected number of cycles, $\\langle N \\rangle$, is the average of $N(\\omega)$ weighted by the probability distribution $P(\\omega)$. It is calculated by the integral:\n$$\n\\langle N \\rangle = \\int_{0}^{\\omega_D} N(\\omega) P(\\omega) d\\omega\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $N(\\omega)$ and $P(\\omega)$:\n$$\n\\langle N \\rangle = \\int_{0}^{\\omega_D} \\left(\\frac{\\omega t}{2\\pi}\\right) \\left(\\frac{3\\omega^2}{\\omega_D^3}\\right) d\\omega\n$$\nWe can pull the constants out of the integral:\n$$\n\\langle N \\rangle = \\frac{3t}{2\\pi \\omega_D^3} \\int_{0}^{\\omega_D} \\omega^3 d\\omega\n$$\nNow, we evaluate the integral of $\\omega^3$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\omega_D} \\omega^3 d\\omega = \\left[ \\frac{\\omega^4}{4} \\right]_{0}^{\\omega_D} = \\frac{\\omega_D^4}{4}\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $\\langle N \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\langle N \\rangle = \\frac{3t}{2\\pi \\omega_D^3} \\left(\\frac{\\omega_D^4}{4}\\right) = \\frac{3t\\omega_D}{8\\pi}\n$$\nThe problem provides the characteristic Debye frequency $f_D = 10^{13}\\ \\text{Hz}$, which is related to the cutoff angular frequency by $\\omega_D = 2\\pi f_D$. We substitute this into our expression for $\\langle N \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\langle N \\rangle = \\frac{3t(2\\pi f_D)}{8\\pi} = \\frac{3tf_D}{4}\n$$\nThis is the final symbolic expression for the expected number of cycles.

            "problem": "A single straight edge dislocation is embedded along the $z$-axis in an otherwise homogeneous, isotropic, linear elastic crystal. The Burgers vector has magnitude $b$ and lies along the $x$-direction. There exists a defect core of radius $a$ around the dislocation line in which atomistic effects dominate and classical continuum elasticity is not valid. Outside the core, the stress magnitude decays with radial distance $r$ from the line and exhibits strong gradients near the core. You aim to compute the stress field with the Finite Element Method (FEM) in a circular domain of radius $R \\gg a$, using piecewise-linear interpolation, under quasi-static conditions.\n\nUse only the following well-tested facts as starting points: (i) outside the core, linear elasticity is applicable, (ii) the dominant stress component near a straight dislocation scales in magnitude as $\\sigma(r) \\sim C/r$ for some constant $C$ dependent on elastic constants and $b$, and (iii) continuum predictions in the core region $r \\lesssim a$ are not reliable. You wish to guarantee that, within each element, the relative variation of stress across the element does not exceed a prescribed tolerance $\\varepsilon \\in (0,1)$.\n\nWhich of the following mesh design strategies most appropriately contrasts the defect core scale with continuum resolution requirements and provides a sound mesh criterion that ensures accurate stress fields?\n\nA. Introduce an inner exclusion boundary at $r_{0} = c\\,a$ with $c = \\mathcal{O}(1)$ to remove the core from the continuum domain and represent its effect via appropriate inner-boundary conditions or eigenstrain.

Choose a mesh independent of $r$, based on the far-field length scale, by enforcing $h \\le \\varepsilon\\, R$ everywhere, because the largest absolute stress values occur near the boundary and therefore set the resolution requirement.\n\nD. Use a second-derivative error estimate for piecewise-linear interpolation and impose $h(r) \\le \\sqrt{\\varepsilon}\\, r$ for all $r \\ge a$, without excluding any inner core, since a weaker $r$-dependence suffices when the error is controlled by $\\sigma''(r)$ rather than $\\sigma'(r)$.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for an appropriate mesh design strategy for a Finite Element Method (FEM) simulation of a dislocation's stress field. The key physical facts are that continuum elasticity is invalid in an atomic core of radius $a$, and outside this core, the stress field decays as $\\sigma(r) \\sim C/r$. The numerical objective is to keep the relative variation of stress within any element below a tolerance $\\varepsilon$.\n\nFirst, let's derive the required local mesh size, $h(r)$. The relative variation of stress across an element of size $h(r)$ at a radial position $r$ can be approximated using a first-order Taylor expansion:\n$$ \\text{Relative Variation} = \\frac{|\\sigma(r+h) - \\sigma(r)|}{\\sigma(r)} \\approx \\frac{|\\frac{d\\sigma}{dr}| h(r)}{\\sigma(r)} $$\nGiven $\\sigma(r) \\sim C/r$, its derivative is $d\\sigma/dr \\sim -C/r^2$. Substituting these into the expression:\n$$ \\text{Relative Variation} \\approx \\frac{(C/r^2) h(r)}{C/r} = \\frac{h(r)}{r} $$\nTo satisfy the tolerance requirement, we must have:\n$$ \\frac{h(r)}{r} \\le \\varepsilon \\implies h(r) \\le \\varepsilon r $$\nThis criterion indicates that a radially graded mesh is required, where the element size scales linearly with the distance from the dislocation. The mesh must be finest near the core and can become progressively coarser at larger radii.\n\nSecond, the problem states that continuum theory is physically invalid in the core region ($r \\lesssim a$). Attempting to resolve this region with a continuum model is fundamentally incorrect, regardless of mesh refinement. The singularity at $r=0$ is a non-physical artifact of the linear elastic model. Therefore, a sound strategy must exclude this region from the FEM domain, typically by creating an inner boundary at a radius $r_0$ on the order of $a$ (e.g., $r_0 \\sim 3a-5a$) and applying the dislocation's effect via boundary conditions (e.g., prescribed displacements from the analytical solution) or an equivalent body force/eigenstrain representation.\n\nNow we evaluate the options based on these two principles:\n\n**A.** This option correctly combines both principles. It advocates for excluding the core with an inner boundary at $r_0 = c \\cdot a$ and applying the derived mesh criterion $h(r) \\le \\varepsilon r$ in the valid continuum domain. This is the standard, physically sound, and computationally efficient approach for this problem.\n\n**B.** This option is flawed. It incorrectly proposes to resolve the core region where the continuum model is invalid. Furthermore, a uniform mesh is highly inefficient for a field with a $1/r$ singularity, as it would be overly fine in the far-field and/or too coarse in the near-field.\n\n**C.** This option is incorrect. It misidentifies where the stress is largest (it's near the core, not the boundary) and proposes a uniform mesh based on the outer radius $R$, which would be grossly under-resolved where the stress gradients are highest.\n\n**D.** This option is flawed because it does not exclude the physically invalid core region. Additionally, while error estimates involving the second derivative exist, the problem's explicit requirement to control the \"relative variation\" of stress directly leads to the first-order estimate $h(r) \\le \\varepsilon r$, making the criterion in option A the most direct and appropriate one.\n\nTherefore, strategy A is the only one that respects the physics of the problem and employs a correct, efficient numerical scheme.",
