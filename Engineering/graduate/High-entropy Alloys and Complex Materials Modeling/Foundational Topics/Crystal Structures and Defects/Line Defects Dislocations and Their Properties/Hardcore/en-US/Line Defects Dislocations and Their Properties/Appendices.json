Consider forest interactions among statistically stored dislocations as the dominant source of short-range obstacle strengthening.

            "solution": "The derivation begins by establishing the mechanical equilibrium for a dislocation segment pinned by two obstacles (e.g., forest dislocations) separated by a distance $\\ell$. Under an applied shear stress $\\tau$, the dislocation line experiences a driving force per unit length, the Peach–Koehler force, given by $f = \\tau b$. This force causes the segment to bow out. The bowing is counteracted by the line tension, $T$, of the dislocation, which acts as a restoring force.\n\nFor a segment bowed into a circular arc of radius $R$, the equilibrium condition is established when the driving force per unit length is balanced by the restoring force per unit length arising from line tension, which is $T/R$. Therefore, the equilibrium is described by:\n$$ \\tau b = \\frac{T}{R} $$\nThe critical stress, $\\tau_c$, required to overcome the obstacles corresponds to the minimum radius of curvature the dislocation can adopt before it bypasses them. For a segment of length $\\ell$, the minimum radius of curvature is achieved when the dislocation bows into a semicircle, at which point $R = \\ell/2$. Substituting this condition into the equilibrium equation gives the critical shear stress for breakaway:\n$$ \\tau_c = \\frac{T}{b R} = \\frac{T}{b (\\ell/2)} = \\frac{2T}{b\\ell} $$\nThe problem provides scaling relationships for line tension, $T$, and obstacle spacing, $\\ell$. We formalize these with dimensionless proportionality constants, $c_T$ and $c_\\ell$, respectively:\n$$ T = c_T G b^2 $$\n$$ \\ell = c_\\ell \\rho^{-1/2} $$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\tau_c$:\n$$ \\tau_c = \\frac{2(c_T G b^2)}{b (c_\\ell \\rho^{-1/2})} = \\left(\\frac{2 c_T}{c_\\ell}\\right) G b \\sqrt{\\rho} $$\nThe problem defines a single dimensionless constant, $\\alpha$, to encapsulate all the geometric and elastic prefactors.

            "solution": "The core of the problem lies in modeling the one-dimensional glide of a dislocation line under an external stress $\\tau_{\\mathrm{ext}}$, opposed by a character-dependent viscous drag and a spatially varying friction stress $\\tau_f(x)$ representing the chemical heterogeneity of a High-Entropy Alloy (HEA).\n\nFirst, we discretize the dislocation line of length $L$ into $N$ nodes, indexed by $i \\in \\{0, \\dots, N-1\\}$. The position of the $i$-th node along the line is $x_i = i \\cdot \\Delta x$, where the grid spacing is $\\Delta x = L/(N-1)$.\n\nAt each node $i$, the dislocation has a local character angle $\\chi_i$. This angle determines the local drag coefficient $B_i = B(\\chi_i)$ via the quadratic mixing rule:\n$$ B(\\chi_i) = B_{\\mathrm{screw}} \\cos^2(\\chi_i) + B_{\\mathrm{edge}} \\sin^2(\\chi_i) $$\nwhere $B_{\\mathrm{screw}}$ and $B_{\\mathrm{edge}}$ are the drag coefficients for pure screw and pure edge characters, respectively. The angles $\\chi_i$ are provided in degrees and must be converted to radians for use in trigonometric functions.\n\nThe local friction stress $\\tau_f(x)$, which represents the resistance to motion from the complex local atomic environment, is modeled as a stationary Gaussian random field. The field is defined by its mean $\\mu_f$, standard deviation $\\sigma_f$, and an exponential covariance function $C(r) = \\sigma_f^2 \\exp(-|r|/\\ell)$, where $r$ is the distance between two points and $\\ell$ is the correlation length. To generate samples of this field at the nodal positions $\\{x_i\\}$, we construct the $N \\times N$ covariance matrix $\\mathbf{C}$ with elements $C_{ij} = C(|x_i - x_j|) = \\sigma_f^2 \\exp(-|x_i - x_j|/\\ell)$. A vector of correlated Gaussian random variables can be generated by first computing the Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix, $\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{L}^T$, where $\\mathbf{L}$ is a lower triangular matrix. A vector of zero-mean correlated values $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}'_f$ is then obtained by multiplying $\\mathbf{L}$ with a vector $\\mathbf{Z}$ of $N$ independent standard normal random variates: $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}'_f = \\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{Z}$. The final friction stress field at the nodes is given by $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_f = \\mu_f + \\boldsymbol{\\tau}'_f$. Since friction stress cannot be negative (it cannot assist motion), any resulting negative values in $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}_f$ are clipped to zero. For reproducibility, the generation of $\\mathbf{Z}$ is seeded as specified in each test case.\n\nThe dynamics of the dislocation are assumed to be in the overdamped regime, where inertial effects are negligible. The local glide velocity $v_i$ is determined by the balance between the driving force per unit length, $b\\,\\tau_{\\mathrm{eff},i}$, and the resistive drag force per unit length, $B_i v_i$. This gives the mobility law:\n$$ B_i v_i = b\\, \\tau_{\\mathrm{eff},i} $$\nwhere $b$ is the magnitude of the Burgers vector. The effective stress $\\tau_{\\mathrm{eff},i}$ is the applied stress $\\tau_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ reduced by the local friction stress $\\tau_{f,i}$. A segment only moves if the applied stress exceeds the local friction threshold. This is expressed as:\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{eff},i} = \\operatorname{sign}(\\tau_{\\mathrm{ext}}) \\max(|\\tau_{\\mathrm{ext}}| - \\tau_{f,i}, 0) $$\nSince $\\tau_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ is positive in all test cases, this simplifies to $\\tau_{\\mathrm{eff},i} = \\max(\\tau_{\\mathrm{ext}} - \\tau_{f,i}, 0)$. The velocity at each node is then:\n$$ v_i = \\frac{b}{B_i} \\max(\\tau_{\\mathrm{ext}} - \\tau_{f,i}, 0) $$\n\nThe problem also requires deriving the maximum stable time step, $\\Delta t_{\\max}$, for an explicit forward Euler time integration of the line-tension evolution equation, given as $B(\\chi)\\, \\partial y/\\partial t = T\\, \\partial^2 y/\\partial x^2$, where $y(x,t)$ is the transverse displacement and $T$ is the line tension. Using a forward difference for the time derivative and a central difference for the spatial second derivative at node $i$ and time step $n$, we obtain:\n$$ B_i \\frac{y_i^{n+1} - y_i^n}{\\Delta t} = T \\frac{y_{i+1}^n - 2y_i^n + y_{i-1}^n}{(\\Delta x)^2} $$\nRearranging for $y_i^{n+1}$ yields the update rule:\n$$ y_i^{n+1} = y_i^n + \\frac{T \\Delta t}{B_i (\\Delta x)^2} (y_{i+1}^n - 2y_i^n + y_{i-1}^n) = \\left(1 - \\frac{2 T \\Delta t}{B_i (\\Delta x)^2}\\right) y_i^n + \\frac{T \\Delta t}{B_i (\\Delta x)^2} (y_{i+1}^n + y_{i-1}^n) $$\nFor this explicit scheme to be numerically stable, the coefficient of the $y_i^n$ term must be non-negative. This leads to the condition:\n$$ 1 - \\frac{2 T \\Delta t}{B_i (\\Delta x)^2} \\ge 0 \\implies \\Delta t \\le \\frac{B_i (\\Delta x)^2}{2T} $$\nTo ensure stability for all nodes, the time step must satisfy the most restrictive of these conditions. This is determined by the node with the smallest drag coefficient $B_i$. Therefore, the maximum stable time step is:\n$$ \\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{(\\min_i B_i) (\\Delta x)^2}{2T} $$\nThe problem specifies using the smallest local $B(\\chi_i)$ value present on the discretized line, which corresponds to $\\min_i B_i$.\n\nFinally, for each test case, we compute three aggregate quantities:\n1.  The average velocity, $\\bar{v} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} v_i$.\n2.  The pinned fraction, $f_{\\mathrm{pin}}$, which is the fraction of nodes with zero velocity. This occurs where $\\tau_{\\mathrm{ext}} \\le \\tau_{f,i}$. Thus, $f_{\\mathrm{pin}} = \\frac{1}{N} |\\{i \\mid \\tau_{\\mathrm{ext}} \\le \\tau_{f,i}\\}|$.\n3.  The maximum stable time step, $\\Delta t_{\\max}$, as derived above.\n\nThe implementation will proceed by calculating these quantities for each test case using the provided parameters and random seeds.",
