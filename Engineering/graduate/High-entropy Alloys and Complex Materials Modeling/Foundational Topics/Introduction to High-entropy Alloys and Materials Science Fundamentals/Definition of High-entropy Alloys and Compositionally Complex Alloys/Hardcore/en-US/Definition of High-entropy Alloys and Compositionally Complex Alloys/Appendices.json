For one mole of atoms, $N$ is Avogadro's number, $N_A$. The molar configurational entropy, which we denote by the same symbol $S_{\\mathrm{config}}$ for simplicity in this context, is:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{config}} = N_{A} k_{B} \\ln n$$\nUsing the given relation for the molar gas constant, $R = N_{A} k_{B}$, we arrive at the final expression for the ideal molar configurational entropy of mixing for an $n$-component equiatomic alloy:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{config}} = R \\ln n$$\nThe dimensionless quantity to be evaluated is $S_{\\mathrm{config}}/R$.

The calculated molar configurational entropies are:\n- $n=4$ alloy: $S_{\\mathrm{config}} \\approx 1.386R$\n- $n=5$ alloy: $S_{\\mathrm{config}} \\approx 1.609R$\n- $n=6$ alloy: $S_{\\mathrm{config}} \\approx 1.792R$\n\nWe compare these values to the proposed thresholds:\n1.  **Threshold $1.0R$**: All three alloys ($n=4$, $n=5$, $n=6$) have configurational entropies greater than $1.0R$. Under this lenient criterion, all would be considered \"high entropy.\"\n2.  **Threshold $1.5R$**: The $n=5$ and $n=6$ alloys exceed this threshold ($1.609R  1.5R$ and $1.792R  1.5R$). The $n=4$ alloy does not ($1.386R  1.5R$). This threshold is significant as it is widely, though informally, used in the materials science literature to define a High-Entropy Alloy (HEA). The basis for this value is that it is surpassed by an equiatomic quinary ($n=5$) alloy, which is the archetypal system for HEAs. Alloys with entropy between $1.0R$ and $1.5R$, like the $n=4$ case, are often termed \"medium-entropy alloys.\"\n3.  **Threshold $2.0R$**: None of the three alloys meet this stringent criterion. An equiatomic alloy would need $n  e^{2.0} \\approx 7.39$ components, meaning $n=8$ or more, to exceed this entropy value.\n\nIn the literature, the term Compositionally Complex Alloy (CCA) serves as a broader category that includes HEAs. CCAs are generally defined as solid solutions containing multiple principal elements in significant concentrations, without a strict entropy requirement. HEAs are a subset of CCAs for which the high configurational entropy (often implying $S_{\\mathrm{config}} \\ge 1.5R$) is considered a defining characteristic that thermodynamically favors the formation of simple solid-solution phases over intermetallic compounds. Based on the common $1.5R$ threshold, the $n=5$ and $n=6$ alloys are classified as HEAs, while the $n=4$ alloy is a CCA (or medium-entropy alloy) but not strictly an HEA.\n\nThe three requested numerical values, expressed as a single row vector, are presented in the final answer.",

Substituting this in:\n$$ S_{conf} \\approx k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\left( N \\ln N - \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i N) \\ln(x_i N) \\right) $$\n$$ S_{conf} \\approx k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\left( N \\ln N - \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i N (\\ln x_i + \\ln N) \\right) $$\n$$ S_{conf} \\approx k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\left( N \\ln N - N \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\ln x_i - N \\ln N \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\right) $$\nSince the sum of mole fractions is $\\sum_i x_i = 1$:\n$$ S_{conf} \\approx k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\left( N \\ln N - N \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\ln x_i - N \\ln N \\right) = -N k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\ln x_i $$\nThe molar configurational entropy, $S_{molar}$, is obtained by dividing the total entropy by the number of moles of atoms, $n_{moles} = N/N_{\\mathrm{A}}$, where $N_{\\mathrm{A}}$ is Avogadro's number. The ideal gas constant is $R = N_{\\mathrm{A}} k_{\\mathrm{B}}$.\n$$ S_{molar} = \\frac{S_{conf}}{n_{moles}} = \\frac{-N k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\ln x_i}{N/N_{\\mathrm{A}}} = -N_{\\mathrm{A}} k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\ln x_i = -R \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\ln x_i $$\nThis is the well-known formula for the ideal entropy of mixing.\n\n**Scenario 1: Single-phase equiatomic quinary solid solution**\nIn this scenario, the alloy is a single phase with $5$ components. The composition is equiatomic, so $x_i = 1/5$ for each species $i \\in \\{A, B, C, D, E\\}$. The molar configurational entropy, $S_1$, is:\n$$ S_1 = -R \\sum_{i=1}^5 \\frac{1}{5} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) = -R \\cdot 5 \\cdot \\frac{1}{5} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) = -R \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) = R \\ln 5 $$\n\n**Scenario 2: Two-phase mixture**\nIn this scenario, the system with overall composition $x_A = x_B = x_C = x_D = x_E = 1/5$ phase-separates into two phases:\n- Phase $\\alpha$: an equiatomic binary solution of $\\{A,B\\}$, so its composition is $x_A^{\\alpha}=1/2, x_B^{\\alpha}=1/2$.\n- Phase $\\beta$: an equiatomic ternary solution of $\\{C,D,E\\}$, so its composition is $x_C^{\\beta}=1/3, x_D^{\\beta}=1/3, x_E^{\\beta}=1/3$.\n\nThe phase fractions, $f_\\alpha$ and $f_\\beta$, are determined by the lever rule (mass balance). For component $A$, the overall mole fraction $x_A$ must satisfy $x_A = f_\\alpha x_A^{\\alpha} + f_\\beta x_A^{\\beta}$.\n$$ \\frac{1}{5} = f_\\alpha \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + f_\\beta (0) \\implies f_\\alpha = \\frac{2}{5} $$\nSince $f_\\alpha + f_\\beta = 1$, we have $f_\\beta = 1 - 2/5 = 3/5$. We can verify this is consistent for all other components. For example, for component $C$:\n$$ x_C = f_\\alpha x_C^{\\alpha} + f_\\beta x_C^{\\beta} = \\left(\\frac{2}{5}\\right)(0) + \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{5} $$\nThis holds for all components. The phase fractions are uniquely determined as $f_\\alpha = 2/5$ and $f_\\beta = 3/5$.\n\nThe total configurational entropy of a multiphase mixture (assuming macroscopic, non-coherent phases) is the sum of the entropies of the individual phases. For a system with $N$ total atoms, there are $N_\\alpha = f_\\alpha N$ atoms in phase $\\alpha$ and $N_\\beta = f_\\beta N$ atoms in phase $\\beta$. The total entropy is $S_2^{total} = S_{\\alpha} + S_{\\beta}$.\nThe molar entropy of the mixture, $S_2$, is the phase-fraction-weighted average of the molar entropies of the individual phases:\n$$ S_2 = f_\\alpha S_{molar}^{\\alpha} + f_\\beta S_{molar}^{\\beta} $$\nThe molar entropy of phase $\\alpha$ is:\n$$ S_{molar}^{\\alpha} = -R \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\ln\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}\\ln\\frac{1}{2} \\right) = -R \\ln\\frac{1}{2} = R \\ln 2 $$\nThe molar entropy of phase $\\beta$ is:\n$$ S_{molar}^{\\beta} = -R \\left( \\frac{1}{3}\\ln\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3}\\ln\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3}\\ln\\frac{1}{3} \\right) = -R \\ln\\frac{1}{3} = R \\ln 3 $$\nSo, the total molar entropy for Scenario 2 is:\n$$ S_2 = \\frac{2}{5} (R \\ln 2) + \\frac{3}{5} (R \\ln 3) = R \\left( \\frac{2}{5}\\ln 2 + \\frac{3}{5}\\ln 3 \\right) $$\n\n**Comparison of Entropies**\nWe must compare $S_1 = R \\ln 5$ and $S_2 = R (\\frac{2}{5}\\ln 2 + \\frac{3}{5}\\ln 3)$. This is equivalent to comparing $\\ln 5$ with $\\frac{2}{5}\\ln 2 + \\frac{3}{5}\\ln 3$.\nWe can rewrite the term for $S_2/R$ as:\n$$ \\frac{2}{5}\\ln 2 + \\frac{3}{5}\\ln 3 = \\ln(2^{2/5}) + \\ln(3^{3/5}) = \\ln(2^{2/5} \\cdot 3^{3/5}) $$\nWe now compare $5$ with $2^{2/5} \\cdot 3^{3/5}$. Let's raise both quantities to the power of $5$:\n$$ 5^5 = 3125 $$\n$$ (2^{2/5} \\cdot 3^{3/5})^5 = (2^{2/5})^5 \\cdot (3^{3/5})^5 = 2^2 \\cdot 3^3 = 4 \\cdot 27 = 108 $$\nSince $3125  108$, it follows that $5  2^{2/5} \\cdot 3^{3/5}$. As the natural logarithm is a strictly increasing function, we have $\\ln 5  \\ln(2^{2/5} \\cdot 3^{3/5})$.\nTherefore, $S_1  S_2$. The single-phase solid solution has a strictly larger molar configurational entropy than the two-phase mixture.\n\nThis result stems from the mathematical property that the entropy of mixing, $S_{molar}(\\mathbf{x}) = -R \\sum x_i \\ln x_i$, is a strictly concave function of the composition vector $\\mathbf{x}$. By Jensen's inequality for a concave function $f$, for any two distinct points $\\mathbf{x}^\\alpha, \\mathbf{x}^\\beta$ and any weight $f_\\alpha \\in (0,1)$, we have $f_\\alpha f(\\mathbf{x}^\\alpha) + (1-f_\\alpha) f(\\mathbf{x}^\\beta)  f(f_\\alpha \\mathbf{x}^\\alpha + (1-f_\\alpha) \\mathbf{x}^\\beta)$.\nIn our case, $S_2 = f_\\alpha S_{molar}(\\mathbf{x}^\\alpha) + f_\\beta S_{molar}(\\mathbf{x}^\\beta)$ and $S_1 = S_{molar}(f_\\alpha \\mathbf{x}^\\alpha + f_\\beta \\mathbf{x}^\\beta)$. The inequality $S_2  S_1$ is a direct consequence of this principle. Phase separation introduces constraints on the placement of atoms, reducing the total number of available microstates compared to a fully random solution of the same overall composition.\n\n**Terminology: HEA vs. CCA**\nThe term High-Entropy Alloy (HEA) was originally conceived to describe alloys that, contrary to traditional metallurgical intuition, form a simple single-phase solid solution (e.g., FCC or BCC) when mixed from multiple principal elements in near-equiatomic proportions. The high configurational entropy of this random solid solution state was proposed as a stabilizing factor. Thus, Scenario 1, the single-phase solid solution with maximized configurational entropy ($R \\ln 5$), is the archetypal example of an HEA.\nThe term Compositionally Complex Alloy (CCA) is a broader and more recent classification. It encompasses all alloys with multiple principal elements, regardless of their phase constitution. This includes single-phase HEAs, but also multi-phase alloys, amorphous alloys (metallic glasses), and alloys containing intermetallic compounds derived from a compositionally complex base. Scenario 2, a multi-phase mixture, fits unequivocally under the CCA umbrella. While some might colloquially refer to it as a \"multi-phase HEA,\" distinguishing it from the single-phase case by using the CCA label is more precise and reflects modern usage. The \"high entropy\" principle is most purely expressed in the single-phase state.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. The single-phase equiatomic quinary has strictly larger molar configurational entropy than the two-phase binary-plus-ternary mixture at the same overall composition, because mixing entropy is a concave function of composition and phase separation lowers the composition-averaged entropy unless the phases have identical compositions. The single-phase material is appropriately termed a High-Entropy Alloy (HEA), whereas the two-phase material is better described as a Compositionally Complex Alloy (CCA).**\n    This statement is entirely consistent with our derivation. It correctly states that the single-phase entropy is larger ($S_1  S_2$), provides the correct fundamental reason (concavity of entropy), and correctly applies the HEA/CCA terminology.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. The two scenarios have equal molar configurational entropy, because the sum of phase entropies weighted by phase fractions equals the single-phase entropy at the same overall composition. Both materials should be termed High-Entropy Alloys (HEAs).**\n    This statement is incorrect. Our calculation shows $S_1  S_2$. The reasoning incorrectly assumes a linear relationship for entropy, which is a strictly concave function of composition.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. The two-phase mixture has larger molar configurational entropy than the single-phase solid solution, because splitting into phases multiplies the number of microstates. The two-phase material is therefore the better example of a High-Entropy Alloy (HEA), and the single-phase material is a Compositionally Complex Alloy (CCA).**\n    This statement is incorrect. Our calculation shows $S_1  S_2$. The physical reasoning is flawed; phase separation constitutes a constraint on the system, reducing the total number of available microstates ($W_1  W_2$), thus lowering the total entropy. The terminology is also reversed.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. No determination can be made without specifying temperature and absolute numbers of sites, because the configurational entropy depends on temperature and system size. Thus neither HEA nor CCA terminology can be assigned from the information given.**\n    This statement is incorrect. The molar configurational entropy in the ideal solution model is independent of temperature. It is also an intensive property, independent of the total number of sites ($N$). The comparison can be made and the terminology can be assigned based on the provided structural and compositional information.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**",
