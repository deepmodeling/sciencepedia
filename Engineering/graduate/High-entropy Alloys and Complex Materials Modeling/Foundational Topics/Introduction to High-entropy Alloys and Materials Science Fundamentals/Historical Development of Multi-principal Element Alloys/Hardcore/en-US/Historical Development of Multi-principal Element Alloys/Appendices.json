For an alloy with $N$ total lattice sites and $n$ different atomic species, the number of ways to arrange the atoms is given by the multinomial coefficient:\n$$W = \\frac{N!}{N_1! N_2! \\cdots N_n!} = \\frac{N!}{\\prod_{i=1}^{n} N_i!}$$\nwhere $N_i$ is the number of atoms of species $i$. The total number of atoms is $N = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} N_i$.\n\nThe problem states the alloy is equiatomic, meaning the number of atoms of each species is the same. Therefore, for $n$ components, $N_1 = N_2 = \\cdots = N_n = N/n$. Substituting this into the expression for $W$:\n$$W = \\frac{N!}{\\left(\\left(\\frac{N}{n}\\right)!\\right)^n}$$\n\nThe configurational entropy $S$ is then:\n$$S = k_B \\ln W = k_B \\ln\\left(\\frac{N!}{\\left(\\left(\\frac{N}{n}\\right)!\\right)^n}\\right) = k_B \\left[ \\ln(N!) - n \\ln\\left(\\left(\\frac{N}{n}\\right)!\\right) \\right]$$\n\nTo simplify this expression, we invoke the thermodynamic limit ($N \\to \\infty$) and apply Stirling's approximation for the natural logarithm of a factorial, $\\ln(x!) \\approx x \\ln x - x$.\n\nApplying this to $\\ln(N!)$:\n$$\\ln(N!) \\approx N \\ln N - N$$\nAnd to $\\ln((\\frac{N}{n})!)$:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\left(\\frac{N}{n}\\right)!\\right) \\approx \\frac{N}{n} \\ln\\left(\\frac{N}{n}\\right) - \\frac{N}{n}$$\n\nSubstituting these approximations into the entropy equation:\n$$S \\approx k_B \\left[ (N \\ln N - N) - n \\left( \\frac{N}{n} \\ln\\left(\\frac{N}{n}\\right) - \\frac{N}{n} \\right) \\right]$$\n$$S \\approx k_B \\left[ N \\ln N - N - N \\ln\\left(\\frac{N}{n}\\right) + N \\right]$$\nThe terms $-N$ and $+N$ cancel:\n$$S \\approx k_B \\left[ N \\ln N - N \\ln\\left(\\frac{N}{n}\\right) \\right]$$\nUsing the logarithm property $\\ln a - \\ln b = \\ln(a/b)$:\n$$S \\approx k_B N \\left[ \\ln N - \\ln\\left(\\frac{N}{n}\\right) \\right] = k_B N \\ln\\left(\\frac{N}{N/n}\\right)$$\n$$S \\approx k_B N \\ln n$$\n\nThis is the total configurational entropy for $N$ atoms. The problem asks for the molar configurational entropy of mixing, $S_{\\text{config}}$. To obtain this, we consider one mole of atoms, so $N = N_A$, where $N_A$ is Avogadro's constant.\n$$S_{\\text{config}} = k_B N_A \\ln n$$\nRecognizing that the molar gas constant $R$ is defined as $R = k_B N_A$, we arrive at the final symbolic expression:\n$$S_{\\text{config}} = R \\ln n$$\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\n\nNow we evaluate this expression for the equiatomic NbMoTaW alloy, which has $n=4$ components.

The claim itself implies a behavior that is fundamentally and significantly slower than in conventional alloys. To assess this, we must use the requested statistical reasoning.\n\nDiffusion coefficients in solids span many orders of magnitude, and their temperature dependence is exponential, as given by the Arrhenius relation $D(T)=D_{0}\\,\\exp(-\\frac{Q}{k_{B}T})$. For this reason, experimental diffusion data are most appropriately analyzed and compared on a logarithmic scale. Taking the natural logarithm of the Arrhenius equation yields:\n$$\n\\ln D(T) = \\ln D_{0} - \\frac{Q}{k_{B}T}\n$$\nThis shows a linear relationship between $\\ln D$ and $1/T$. Experimental uncertainties in determining $D$ are therefore best expressed as an uncertainty in $\\ln D$, denoted as $\\sigma_{\\ln D}$.\n\nThe comparison between diffusion in the Cantor alloy and pure nickel is captured by the ratio $R$. On a logarithmic scale, this comparison becomes the difference:\n$$\n\\ln R = \\ln \\left( \\frac{D_{Cantor}}{D_{Ni}} \\right) = \\ln D_{Cantor} - \\ln D_{Ni}\n$$\nFor the given data, this logarithmic ratio is:\n$$\n\\ln R = \\ln(0.5) = -\\ln(2) \\approx -0.693\n$$\nThe question of whether the observed reduction is significant is equivalent to asking if this difference, $\\ln R$, is statistically distinguishable from zero, given the inherent uncertainties in the experimental measurements.\n\nLet $\\sigma_{\\ln D_{Cantor}}$ and $\\sigma_{\\ln D_{Ni}}$ be the standard uncertainties associated with the measurements of $\\ln D_{Cantor}$ and $\\ln D_{Ni}$, respectively. Assuming the two measurements are independent, the uncertainty in their difference, $\\sigma_{\\ln R}$, is found by propagating the uncertainties:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\ln R} = \\sqrt{\\sigma_{\\ln D_{Cantor}}^2 + \\sigma_{\\ln D_{Ni}}^2}\n$$\nAn analytic criterion for the \"sluggish diffusion\" claim to be substantively supported is that the magnitude of the measured logarithmic ratio must be significantly larger than its uncertainty. A common threshold for statistical significance is two or three standard deviations (i.e., $2\\sigma$ or $3\\sigma$). Thus, the criterion is:\n$$\n|\\ln R| > z \\cdot \\sigma_{\\ln R}\n$$\nwhere $z$ is a factor, typically $z=2$ or $z=3$, representing the desired confidence level.\n\nThe problem requires a discussion based on *generic* statistical reasoning, without providing specific uncertainty values. In the field of solid-state diffusion, high-precision experiments might achieve an uncertainty in $D$ on the order of $\\pm 20\\%$ to $\\pm 30\\%$. An uncertainty of, say, $25\\%$ in $D$ corresponds to an uncertainty in $\\ln D$ of approximately $\\sigma_{\\ln D} \\approx \\ln(1.25) \\approx 0.22$. Let us adopt a generic standard uncertainty of $\\sigma_{\\ln D} \\approx 0.2-0.3$ as a typical value for a single measurement. Assuming the experimental efforts are comparable, so $\\sigma_{\\ln D_{Cantor}} \\approx \\sigma_{\\ln D_{Ni}} \\equiv \\sigma_{\\ln D}$, the uncertainty in the logarithmic ratio becomes:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\ln R} \\approx \\sqrt{\\sigma_{\\ln D}^2 + \\sigma_{\\ln D}^2} = \\sqrt{2} \\sigma_{\\ln D}\n$$\nFor a generic $\\sigma_{\\ln D} = 0.25$, we would have $\\sigma_{\\ln R} \\approx \\sqrt{2} \\times 0.25 \\approx 0.35$.\n\nThe significance criterion then requires $|\\ln R| > z \\cdot 0.35$. With our calculated $|\\ln R| \\approx 0.693$:\n-   For a $z=2$ criterion (approx. $95\\%$ confidence), the threshold would be $2 \\times 0.35 = 0.70$. Our value of $0.693$ is just at this threshold.\n-   For a $z=3$ criterion (approx. $99.7\\%$ confidence), the threshold would be $3 \\times 0.35 = 1.05$. Our value of $0.693$ is well below this.\n\nThis analysis shows that a factor-of-two difference is on the borderline of being statistically significant at the $\\approx 2\\sigma$ level and is not significant at a higher confidence level.\n\nFurthermore, the term \"sluggish\" in a scientific context implies a substantial, often order-of-magnitude, effect. A factor-of-two difference is a very modest change when diffusion coefficients can vary over $10$ or more orders of magnitude across different materials and temperature ranges. The chemical complexity of the Cantor alloy (five principal elements) compared to a pure element (nickel) could easily introduce variations in bonding and defect energetics that result in factor-of-two changes in kinetics, without necessitating a paradigm-shifting concept like \"sluggish diffusion.\"\n\nIn conclusion, while the data indicate that diffusion is slower in the Cantor alloy, a reduction by a factor of only two ($|\\ln R| \\approx 0.693$) is not, by itself, strong or substantive support for the historical claim of \"sluggish diffusion.\" The magnitude of the effect is comparable to what might be expected from typical experimental uncertainty and modest changes in system properties. Conclusive evidence would require demonstrating a reduction by a much larger factor (e.g., an order of magnitude or more, which would mean $|\\ln R| > \\ln(10) \\approx 2.3$) or showing a systematically higher activation energy $Q$ over a wide temperature range.",
