Rather than relying on composition alone, effective models use physically-motivated descriptors that capture the underlying physics of alloy behavior.

            "problem": "In the inverse design of High-Entropy Alloys (HEAs) and complex concentrated alloys, a key mechanistic descriptor of solid solution propensity is the composition-weighted atomic size mismatch, which quantifies how substitutional disorder perturbs the host lattice. Starting from linear elasticity for small strains and the definition of a composition-weighted average radius, construct a dimensionless mismatch metric that is the square root of a composition-weighted mean square of relative radius deviations. Using this metric as a physically grounded feature, explain why, at fixed temperature, increasing the mismatch introduces a rising elastic enthalpic penalty that competes with the configurational entropy, thereby producing a monotonic relationship between mismatch and the likelihood of single-phase solid solution formation in machine learning classifiers.\n\nThen compute the mismatch metric for the equiatomic refractory HEA candidate $\\mathrm{Ti}$–$\\mathrm{Zr}$–$\\mathrm{Hf}$–$\\mathrm{Nb}$–$\\mathrm{Ta}$ with metallic radii (assumed for twelvefold coordination) $r_{\\mathrm{Ti}}=147\\ \\text{pm}$, $r_{\\mathrm{Zr}}=160\\ \\text{pm}$, $r_{\\mathrm{Hf}}=159\\ \\text{pm}$, $r_{\\mathrm{Nb}}=146\\ \\text{pm}$, and $r_{\\mathrm{Ta}}=146\\ \\text{pm}$, and mole fractions $x_i=0.2$ for each element.

Round your final value to four significant figures. Express the final answer as a dimensionless number.",
            "solution": "The goal is to connect a physically motivated descriptor to solid solution formation and then to compute it for a specified equiatomic alloy.\n\nFundamental base:\n1. For small elastic strains, linear elasticity applies, and the elastic energy density scales as the square of strain. For a homogeneous isotropic solid, the elastic energy density can be written as a quadratic form in strain with moduli such as the bulk modulus and shear modulus. When substitutional atoms differ in radius from a mean matrix radius, they induce local dilatational (volumetric) and shear strains in the lattice.\n2. The composition-weighted mean atomic radius is defined as $\\bar r=\\sum_i x_i r_i$. Deviations from this mean, normalized by $\\bar r$, define a nondimensional misfit strain. The relative deviation is defined in the problem as $1-\\frac{r_i}{\\bar r}$.\n3. Because elastic enthalpy contributions scale quadratically with strain, a natural scalar descriptor of the aggregate mismatch in a random substitutional alloy is the composition-weighted root-mean-square of these normalized deviations:\n$$\n\\delta=\\sqrt{\\sum_i x_i\\left(1-\\frac{r_i}{\\bar r}\\right)^{2}}.\n$$\nThis $\\delta$ is dimensionless and measures the typical relative size misfit in the alloy.\n\nWhy $\\delta$ correlates with single-phase solid solution formation:\n- The Helmholtz free energy per atom can be viewed schematically as $F=H-T S$, where $H$ contains the elastic enthalpy penalty from size mismatch and other interaction terms, and $S$ includes the configurational entropy. For a random substitutional alloy with $n$ components at mole fractions $\\{x_i\\}$, the configurational entropy per atom is $S_{\\mathrm{conf}}= -k_{B}\\sum_i x_i \\ln x_i$ and is independent of the atomic radii $\\{r_i\\}$ for fixed composition.\n- The elastic part of the enthalpy increases with the square of the misfit strain, and at a coarse-grained level scales as a modulus times $\\sum_i x_i \\epsilon_i^{2}$; hence, the enthalpic penalty is monotonically increasing in $\\delta^{2}$. For fixed $T$ and $\\{x_i\\}$, a larger $\\delta$ raises $H$ without increasing $S_{\\mathrm{conf}}$, thereby increasing $F$ and making the single-phase random solid solution less favorable relative to phase separation or intermetallic formation.\n- Therefore, in supervised machine learning classifiers or probabilistic models that take physically motivated features, a monotonic negative relationship between $\\delta$ and the probability of single-phase solid solution formation is expected, with other features (e.g., mixing enthalpy, electronegativity differences, valence electron concentration) providing additional modulation. In inverse design, minimizing $\\delta$ subject to target property constraints reduces elastic mismatch penalties and increases the likelihood of single-phase solutions.\n\nCompute $\\delta$ for the given HEA:\n- Given equiatomic fractions $x_i=0.2$ for each of the five elements and metallic radii\n$\nr_{\\mathrm{Ti}}=147\\ \\text{pm},\\quad\nr_{\\mathrm{Zr}}=160\\ \\text{pm},\\quad\nr_{\\mathrm{Hf}}=159\\ \\text{pm},\\quad\nr_{\\mathrm{Nb}}=146\\ \\text{pm},\\quad\nr_{\\mathrm{Ta}}=146\\ \\text{pm}.\n$\nFirst compute the mean radius:\n$$\n\\bar r=\\sum_i x_i r_i\n=0.2\\,(147+160+159+146+146)\\ \\text{pm}\n=0.2\\times 758\\ \\text{pm}\n=151.6\\ \\text{pm}.\n$$\nCompute the normalized deviations $1-\\frac{r_i}{\\bar r}$ for each element:\n$$\n1-\\frac{r_{\\mathrm{Ti}}}{\\bar r}=1-\\frac{147}{151.6}\\approx 1-0.9697=0.0303,\n$$\n$$\n1-\\frac{r_{\\mathrm{Zr}}}{\\bar r}=1-\\frac{160}{151.6}\\approx 1-1.0554=-0.0554,\n$$\n$$\n1-\\frac{r_{\\mathrm{Hf}}}{\\bar r}=1-\\frac{159}{151.6}\\approx 1-1.0488=-0.0488,\n$$\n$$\n1-\\frac{r_{\\mathrm{Nb}}}{\\bar r}=1-\\frac{146}{151.6}\\approx 1-0.9630=0.0370,\n$$\n$$\n1-\\frac{r_{\\mathrm{Ta}}}{\\bar r}=1-\\frac{146}{151.6}\\approx 1-0.9630=0.0370.\n$$\nForm the composition-weighted mean square and take the square root:\n$$\n\\delta=\\sqrt{\\sum_i x_i\\left(1-\\frac{r_i}{\\bar r}\\right)^{2}}\n=\\sqrt{0.2\\left(0.0303^{2}+(-0.0554)^{2}+(-0.0488)^{2}+0.0370^{2}+0.0370^{2}\\right)}.\n$$\nEvaluate the inside:\n$$\n0.0303^{2}\\approx 9.18\\times 10^{-4},\\quad\n(-0.0554)^{2}\\approx 3.07\\times 10^{-3},\\quad\n(-0.0488)^{2}\\approx 2.38\\times 10^{-3},\\quad\n0.0370^{2}\\approx 1.37\\times 10^{-3}.\n$$\nSum:\n$$\n9.18\\times 10^{-4}+3.07\\times 10^{-3}+2.38\\times 10^{-3}+1.37\\times 10^{-3}+1.37\\times 10^{-3}\n\\approx 9.104\\times 10^{-3}.\n$$\nMultiply by $0.2$:\n$$\n0.2\\times 9.104\\times 10^{-3}\\approx 1.8208\\times 10^{-3}.\n$$\nTake the square root:\n$$\n\\delta\\approx \\sqrt{1.8208\\times 10^{-3}}\\approx 0.04267.\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures and expressed as a dimensionless number, the mismatch metric is $0.04267$.

The components are already sorted in descending order.\nLet's find $\\rho$:\n- Try $\\rho=5$: We would assume all $x_i > 0$. $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{5}(\\sum_{i=1}^5 y_i - 1) = \\frac{1}{5}(0.6+0.4+0.3+0.2-0.2 - 1) = \\frac{1}{5}(1.3 - 1) = 0.06$.\nThe condition $y_5 > \\lambda$ must hold. However, $-0.2 \\ngtr 0.06$. So $\\rho < 5$.\n\n- Try $\\rho=4$: We assume the first four components are positive in the projection, and $x_5=0$.\n$\\lambda = \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^4 y_i - 1\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}(0.6+0.4+0.3+0.2 - 1) = \\frac{1}{4}(1.5 - 1) = \\frac{0.5}{4} = 0.125$.\nWe check if this $\\lambda$ is consistent with our assumption. We need $y_4 > \\lambda$ and $y_5 \\leq \\lambda$.\n$y_4 = 0.2$, so $0.2 > 0.125$, which is true.\n$y_5 = -0.2$, so $-0.2 \\leq 0.125$, which is true.\nThus, our choice of $\\rho=4$ is correct, and $\\lambda = 0.125$.\n\nNow we compute the components of the projected vector $\\mathbf{x}^{\\star}$ using $x_i^{\\star} = \\max(0, y_i - \\lambda)$. For precision, we use rational numbers: $\\lambda = 0.125 = \\frac{1}{8}$.\nThe input vector is $\\mathbf{y} = (\\frac{3}{5}, \\frac{2}{5}, \\frac{3}{10}, \\frac{1}{5}, -\\frac{1}{5})$.\n\n$x_1^{\\star} = x_{\\text{Fe}}^{\\star} = \\frac{3}{5} - \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{24 - 5}{40} = \\frac{19}{40}$\n$x_2^{\\star} = x_{\\text{Ni}}^{\\star} = \\frac{2}{5} - \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{16 - 5}{40} = \\frac{11}{40}$\n$x_3^{\\star} = x_{\\text{Cr}}^{\\star} = \\frac{3}{10} - \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{12 - 5}{40} = \\frac{7}{40}$\n$x_4^{\\star} = x_{\\text{Mn}}^{\\star} = \\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{8 - 5}{40} = \\frac{3}{40}$\n$x_5^{\\star} = x_{\\text{Pb}}^{\\star} = \\max(0, -\\frac{1}{5} - \\frac{1}{8}) = \\max(0, -\\frac{13}{40}) = 0$\n\nThe projected composition vector is $\\mathbf{x}^{\\star} = (\\frac{19}{40}, \\frac{11}{40}, \\frac{7}{40}, \\frac{3}{40}, 0)$.\nAs a check, the components are all non-negative and they sum to one:\n$\\frac{19+11+7+3+0}{40} = \\frac{40}{40} = 1$.",
