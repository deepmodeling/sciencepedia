            "problem": "A single substitutional oversized solute with positive relaxation volume $\\Delta \\Omega > 0$ is embedded in a concentrated face-centered cubic high-entropy alloy (HEA), which is modeled at the mesoscale as an isotropic effective medium with shear modulus $\\mu$ and Poisson ratio $\\nu$.

All provided information is standard in the field of dislocation theory within materials science. The tasks are clearly defined and a unique solution can be derived from the premises. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe primary objective is to derive the interaction energy, $E(r,\\theta)$, between a straight edge dislocation and a substitutional solute atom, treated as a center of dilatation. The interaction energy is given by the expression $E = -\\sigma_{\\mathrm{h}}\\,\\Delta \\Omega$, where $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{h}}$ is the hydrostatic component of the dislocation's stress field and $\\Delta \\Omega$ is the relaxation volume of the solute.\n\nOur derivation proceeds in several steps:\n1.  Calculate the trace of the in-plane stress tensor, $\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy}$.\n2.  Determine the out-of-plane stress component, $\\sigma_{zz}$, using the plane strain condition.\n3.  Combine these to find the hydrostatic stress, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{h}}$.\n4.  Transform the expression for $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{h}}$ from Cartesian coordinates $(x,y)$ to polar coordinates $(r,\\theta)$.\n5.  Substitute the resulting expression for $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{h}}(r,\\theta)$ into the energy formula.\n6.  Analyze the angular dependence of the resulting energy landscape $E(r,\\theta)$ to identify positions of strongest attraction and repulsion.\n\nFirst, we sum the given in-plane normal stress components, $\\sigma_{xx}$ and $\\sigma_{yy}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx}+\\sigma_{yy} = \\left( - \\frac{\\mu\\, b}{2\\pi\\,(1-\\nu)}\\,\\frac{y\\left(3x^{2}+y^{2}\\right)}{\\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\\right)^{2}} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{\\mu\\, b}{2\\pi\\,(1-\\nu)}\\,\\frac{y\\left(x^{2}-y^{2}\\right)}{\\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\\right)^{2}} \\right)\n$$\nFactoring out the common terms:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx}+\\sigma_{yy} = \\frac{\\mu\\, b\\, y}{2\\pi\\,(1-\\nu)\\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\\right)^{2}} \\left[ -(3x^2 + y^2) + (x^2 - y^2) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx}+\\sigma_{yy} = \\frac{\\mu\\, b\\, y}{2\\pi\\,(1-\\nu)\\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\\right)^{2}} \\left[ -3x^2 - y^2 + x^2 - y^2 \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx}+\\sigma_{yy} = \\frac{\\mu\\, b\\, y}{2\\pi\\,(1-\\nu)\\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\\right)^{2}} \\left[ -2x^2 - 2y^2 \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx}+\\sigma_{yy} = \\frac{\\mu\\, b\\, y}{2\\pi\\,(1-\\nu)\\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\\right)^{2}} \\left[ -2(x^2 + y^2) \\right]\n$$\nSimplifying the expression yields the trace of the in-plane stress:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xx}+\\sigma_{yy} = - \\frac{\\mu\\, b\\, y}{\\pi\\,(1-\\nu)(x^2+y^2)}\n$$\nUnder the condition of plane strain, the out-of-plane stress $\\sigma_{zz}$ is related to the in-plane stresses by $\\sigma_{zz} = \\nu(\\sigma_{xx}+\\sigma_{yy})$. Substituting the expression we just derived:\n$$\n\\sigma_{zz} = \\nu \\left( - \\frac{\\mu\\, b\\, y}{\\pi\\,(1-\\nu)(x^2+y^2)} \\right) = - \\frac{\\mu\\, b\\, \\nu\\, y}{\\pi\\,(1-\\nu)(x^2+y^2)}\n$$\nThe hydrostatic stress, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{h}}$, is defined as the mean of the normal stresses: $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{h}} = \\frac{1}{3}(\\sigma_{xx}+\\sigma_{yy}+\\sigma_{zz})$. We can rewrite this as $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{h}} = \\frac{1}{3}[(\\sigma_{xx}+\\sigma_{yy}) + \\sigma_{zz}]$. Substituting our expressions for $(\\sigma_{xx}+\\sigma_{yy})$ and $\\sigma_{zz}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{h}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\left[ - \\frac{\\mu\\, b\\, y}{\\pi\\,(1-\\nu)(x^2+y^2)} - \\frac{\\mu\\, b\\, \\nu\\, y}{\\pi\\,(1-\\nu)(x^2+y^2)} \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{h}} = \\frac{1}{3} \\left( - \\frac{\\mu\\, b\\, y}{\\pi\\,(1-\\nu)(x^2+y^2)} \\right) (1+\\nu)\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{h}} = - \\frac{\\mu\\, b\\,(1+\\nu)}{3\\pi\\,(1-\\nu)} \\frac{y}{x^2+y^2}\n$$\nNext, we convert this expression to polar coordinates using the transformations $x=r\\cos\\theta$ and $y=r\\sin\\theta$, which implies $x^2+y^2=r^2$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{h}}(r,\\theta) = - \\frac{\\mu\\, b\\,(1+\\nu)}{3\\pi\\,(1-\\nu)} \\frac{r\\sin\\theta}{r^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{h}}(r,\\theta) = - \\frac{\\mu\\, b\\,(1+\\nu)}{3\\pi\\,(1-\\nu)} \\frac{\\sin\\theta}{r}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute this expression for the hydrostatic stress into the formula for the interaction energy, $E = -\\sigma_{\\mathrm{h}}\\,\\Delta \\Omega$:\n$$\nE(r,\\theta) = - \\left( - \\frac{\\mu\\, b\\,(1+\\nu)}{3\\pi\\,(1-\\nu)} \\frac{\\sin\\theta}{r} \\right) \\Delta\\Omega\n$$\nThis gives the final analytic expression for the interaction energy landscape:\n$$\nE(r,\\theta) = \\frac{\\mu\\, b\\,(1+\\nu)\\,\\Delta\\Omega}{3\\pi\\,(1-\\nu)} \\frac{\\sin\\theta}{r}\n$$\n\nThe second part of the task is to identify the angular positions of strongest attraction and repulsion for an oversized solute ($\\Delta\\Omega > 0$). The interaction energy is attractive when $E0$ and repulsive when $E>0$. The strength of the interaction at a fixed radius $r$ is determined by the term $\\sin\\theta$.\nThe prefactor $A = \\frac{\\mu\\, b\\,(1+\\nu)\\,\\Delta\\Omega}{3\\pi\\,(1-\\nu)}$ is positive, since the shear modulus $\\mu$, Burgers vector magnitude $b$, and relaxation volume $\\Delta\\Omega$ are positive, and for any stable isotropic material, $1+\\nu > 0$ and $1-\\nu > 0$.\n\nStrongest attraction occurs when the energy $E(r,\\theta)$ is minimized (most negative). This corresponds to the minimum value of $\\sin\\theta$, which is $-1$.\n$$\n\\sin\\theta = -1 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\theta = \\frac{3\\pi}{2} \\text{ radians}\n$$\nStrongest repulsion occurs when the energy $E(r,\\theta)$ is maximized (most positive). This corresponds to the maximum value of $\\sin\\theta$, which is $+1$.\n$$\n\\sin\\theta = +1 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\text{ radians}\n$$\n\nPhysical Justification: The edge dislocation has an extra half-plane of atoms inserted above the glide plane ($y>0$). This creates a compressive stress field in the region $\\theta \\in (0, \\pi)$ and a tensile stress field in the region $\\theta \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$ below the glide plane. An oversized solute atom ($\\Delta\\Omega > 0$) introduces its own compressive strain. To minimize the total strain energy of the crystal, the solute atom is attracted to regions of tension (where there is more available volume) and repelled from regions of compression.\n- The strongest tension is directly below the dislocation core at $\\theta = 3\\pi/2$, hence this is the position of strongest attraction.\n- The strongest compression is directly above the dislocation core at $\\theta = \\pi/2$, hence this is the position of strongest repulsion.\nThis physical reasoning is perfectly consistent with our mathematical findings.\nThe final answer requested is only the analytic expression for $E(r,\\theta)$.",

Calculate the mean $\\langle E_b \\rangle$ and variance $\\text{Var}(E_b)$ of the binding energy distribution.\n\n**1. Hydrostatic Pressure of an Edge Dislocation**\n\nIn an isotropic elastic medium under plane strain, the stress field of a straight edge dislocation with Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b} = (b, 0, 0)$ lying along the $z$-axis is given in polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$ by:\n$$ \\sigma_{rr} = \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta} = -\\frac{\\mu b}{2\\pi(1-\\nu)} \\frac{\\sin\\theta}{r} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{r\\theta} = \\frac{\\mu b}{2\\pi(1-\\nu)} \\frac{\\cos\\theta}{r} $$\nThe sum of the normal stresses in the $xy$-plane is invariant under rotation, so $\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy} = \\sigma_{rr} + \\sigma_{\\theta\\theta}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy} = -\\frac{\\mu b}{\\pi(1-\\nu)} \\frac{\\sin\\theta}{r} $$\nUnder plane strain conditions, the stress component along the dislocation line is non-zero and is given by $\\sigma_{zz} = \\nu(\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy})$.\n$$ \\sigma_{zz} = -\\frac{\\nu \\mu b}{\\pi(1-\\nu)} \\frac{\\sin\\theta}{r} $$\nThe hydrostatic pressure $p$ is defined as $p = -\\frac{1}{3}(\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy} + \\sigma_{zz})$.\n$$ p = -\\frac{1}{3} (\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy} + \\nu(\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy})) = -\\frac{1+\\nu}{3}(\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy}) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy}$:\n$$ p(r, \\theta) = -\\frac{1+\\nu}{3} \\left( -\\frac{\\mu b}{\\pi(1-\\nu)} \\frac{\\sin\\theta}{r} \\right) = \\frac{\\mu b (1+\\nu)}{3\\pi(1-\\nu)} \\frac{\\sin\\theta}{r} $$\n\n**2. Binding Energy**\n\nThe binding energy $E_b$ of a dilatational center with misfit volume $\\Delta \\Omega$ is $E_b = -p \\, \\Delta \\Omega$.\n$$ E_b(r, \\theta) = - \\left( \\frac{\\mu b (1+\\nu)}{3\\pi(1-\\nu)} \\frac{\\sin\\theta}{r} \\right) \\Delta \\Omega $$\nFor notational convenience, let us define a positive constant $A$ that encapsulates the material and defect parameters:\n$$ A = \\frac{\\mu b |\\Delta \\Omega| (1+\\nu)}{3\\pi(1-\\nu)} $$\nThe sign of $\\Delta \\Omega$ determines whether the energy is positive or negative for a given position. Let's write the energy as $E_b = \\mp A \\frac{\\sin\\theta}{r}$, where the sign depends on the sign of $\\Delta \\Omega$. For the derivation of the PDF of the magnitude of the energy, this sign is not critical, and we will assume $\\Delta \\Omega > 0$ without loss of generality, leading to $E_b = -A \\frac{\\sin\\theta}{r}$. The final results for variance will depend on $A^2$, and thus on $(\\Delta \\Omega)^2$, making them independent of the sign.\n\n**3. Solute Position Probability Distribution**\n\nThe solute position $(x,y)$ is uniformly distributed over the area of the annulus defined by $r_c \\le r \\le R$. The area of this annulus is $\\mathcal{A} = \\pi R^2 - \\pi r_c^2 = \\pi(R^2 - r_c^2)$. The probability of finding a solute in a small area element $dA$ is $P(dA) = dA/\\mathcal{A}$. In polar coordinates, the area element is $dA = r\\,dr\\,d\\theta$. The joint probability density function (PDF) for the random variables $r$ and $\\theta$ is therefore:\n$$ p(r, \\theta) = \\frac{r}{\\pi(R^2 - r_c^2)} \\quad \\text{for } r \\in [r_c, R] \\text{ and } \\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi] $$\n\n**4. Probability Density Function of the Binding Energy, $p(E_b)$**\n\nWe wish to find the PDF of the random variable $E_b = -A \\frac{\\sin\\theta}{r}$. This can be derived using the method of transformation of variables. Let us introduce an auxiliary random variable, $S=r$. We find the joint PDF $p(E_b, S)$ and then integrate out $S$. The inverse transformation is $r=S$ and $\\sin\\theta = -S E_b / A$. The Jacobian of the transformation from $(r, \\theta)$ to $(E_b, S)$ is:\n$$ J = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial E_b}{\\partial r}  \\frac{\\partial E_b}{\\partial \\theta} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial r}  \\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial \\theta} \\end{pmatrix} = \\det \\begin{pmatrix} A \\frac{\\sin\\theta}{r^2}  -A \\frac{\\cos\\theta}{r} \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix} = A \\frac{\\cos\\theta}{r} $$\nThe joint PDF $p(E_b, S)$ is given by $p(E_b, S) = \\sum_{i} p(r_i, \\theta_i) |J^{-1}|_i$, where the sum is over all solutions $(r_i, \\theta_i)$. For a given pair $(E_b, S)$, we have $r=S$. The equation $\\sin\\theta = -S E_b / A$ has two solutions for $\\theta$ in $[0, 2\\pi]$ provided that $|-S E_b / A|  1$. The Jacobian magnitude is $|J^{-1}| = \\frac{r}{|A \\cos\\theta|} = \\frac{S}{A\\sqrt{1-(S E_b/A)^2}}$.\nSince $p(r, \\theta)$ is independent of $\\theta$, and the Jacobian magnitude is the same for both solutions of $\\theta$, we have:\n$$ p(E_b, S) = 2 \\times p(r=S, \\theta) \\times |J^{-1}| = 2 \\frac{S}{\\pi(R^2-r_c^2)} \\frac{S}{A\\sqrt{1 - S^2 E_b^2 / A^2}} $$\n$$ p(E_b, S) = \\frac{2 S^2}{\\pi A (R^2-r_c^2)\\sqrt{1 - S^2 E_b^2 / A^2}} $$\nThis is valid for $r_c \\le S \\le R$ and $|E_b| \\le A/S$. To find $p(E_b)$, we integrate over $S$. The integration limits for $S$ are determined by the domain: $S \\in [r_c, \\min(R, A/|E_b|)]$. This leads to a piecewise function for $p(E_b)$.\nLet $C_p = \\frac{2}{\\pi A (R^2-r_c^2)}$. The integral is $\\int \\frac{S^2 dS}{\\sqrt{1 - (S|E_b|/A)^2}}$. The indefinite integral is $\\frac{A^3}{2|E_b|^3}\\left[\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{S|E_b|}{A}\\right) - \\frac{S|E_b|}{A}\\sqrt{1-\\frac{S^2E_b^2}{A^2}}\\right]$.\nThe final PDF $p(E_b)$ is symmetric about $E_b=0$ and is given by:\n- For $0 \\le |E_b| \\le A/R$:\n$$ p(E_b) = \\frac{A^2(I(R) - I(r_c))}{\\pi(R^2-r_c^2)|E_b|^3} $$\nwhere $I(x) = \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{x|E_b|}{A}\\right) - \\frac{x|E_b|}{A}\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{x^2 E_b^2}{A^2}}$.\n- For $A/R  |E_b| \\le A/r_c$:\n$$ p(E_b) = \\frac{A^2(\\frac{\\pi}{2} - I(r_c))}{\\pi(R^2-r_c^2)|E_b|^3} $$\n- For $|E_b|  A/r_c$, $p(E_b) = 0$.\n\n**5. Mean and Variance of the Binding Energy**\n\nThe mean binding energy $\\langle E_b \\rangle$ is calculated by integrating $E_b(r, \\theta)$ weighted by the probability density $p(r, \\theta)$:\n$$ \\langle E_b \\rangle = \\int_{r_c}^{R} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} E_b(r, \\theta) p(r, \\theta) d\\theta dr = \\int_{r_c}^{R} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\left(-A \\frac{\\sin\\theta}{r}\\right) \\frac{r}{\\pi(R^2-r_c^2)} d\\theta dr $$\n$$ \\langle E_b \\rangle = -\\frac{A}{\\pi(R^2-r_c^2)} \\int_{r_c}^{R} dr \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\sin\\theta d\\theta $$\nThe integral over $\\theta$ is $\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\sin\\theta d\\theta = [-\\cos\\theta]_{0}^{2\\pi} = -1 - (-1) = 0$.\nTherefore, the mean binding energy is zero.\n$$ \\langle E_b \\rangle = 0 $$\nThis result is expected from the odd symmetry of the interaction energy with respect to the slip plane ($\\theta=0, \\pi$) and the uniform angular distribution of solutes.\n\nThe variance of the binding energy is $\\text{Var}(E_b) = \\langle E_b^2 \\rangle - \\langle E_b \\rangle^2$. Since the mean is zero, the variance is equal to the mean squared energy, $\\langle E_b^2 \\rangle$.\n$$ \\langle E_b^2 \\rangle = \\int_{r_c}^{R} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} E_b(r, \\theta)^2 p(r, \\theta) d\\theta dr = \\int_{r_c}^{R} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\left(-A \\frac{\\sin\\theta}{r}\\right)^2 \\frac{r}{\\pi(R^2-r_c^2)} d\\theta dr $$\n$$ \\langle E_b^2 \\rangle = \\frac{A^2}{\\pi(R^2-r_c^2)} \\int_{r_c}^{R} \\frac{1}{r^2} r dr \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\sin^2\\theta d\\theta $$\nWe evaluate the two integrals separately.

By calibrating the model with hypothetical data from atomistic simulations, you will experience how fundamental theory is integrated with computational methods to predict the critical resolved shear stress, a cornerstone of quantitative alloy design.",

            "problem": "Consider a single dislocation segment in a chemically random concentrated alloy, modeled as an elastic string with line coordinate $x$ and transverse displacement $u(x)$. The dislocation interacts with solute-induced fluctuations that can be represented, at mesoscopic scale, as a random force per unit length $f(x)$ along the line. Assume zero mean $\\langle f(x) \\rangle = 0$ and a short-range autocorrelation $\\langle f(x) f(x+r) \\rangle = C(r)$ characterized by a variance $C(0) = \\sigma_f^2$ and an integral correlation length defined by\n$$\n\\xi = \\frac{1}{C(0)} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} C(r)\\, dr.\n$$\nTreat the dislocation as an elastic string with line tension $T$ so that small curvature costs elastic energy; take $T$ as a constant parameter derived from linear elasticity. An applied shear stress $\\tau$ exerts a uniform driving Peach-Koehler force per unit length equal to $\\tau b$, where $b$ is the magnitude of the Burgers vector.\n\nStarting from the following fundamental bases:\n- Linear elasticity and Hooke’s law, where line tension for a straight dislocation segment is approximated by $T = \\alpha G b^2$ with $G$ the shear modulus and $\\alpha$ a geometry factor (for an edge dislocation $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2(1-\\nu)}$, for a screw dislocation $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}$, with $\\nu$ the Poisson ratio).\n- The central limit behavior of integrated random forces over segments much longer than the correlation length, so that the net pinning force over a segment of length $L$ has typical magnitude $F_p(L) \\sim \\sigma_f \\sqrt{L \\xi}$.\n- Energetic balance for the elastic string displacement under pinning, where typical elastic restoring force scales as $F_e(L) \\sim T u / L$.\n- The onset of collective pinning defined by the Larkin length $L_c$ at which the typical displacement $u(L)$ driven by disorder becomes comparable to the disorder correlation length transverse scale, here taken as $u(L_c) \\sim \\xi$ for calibration purposes.\n- The critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) condition where the applied driving force balances the typical net pinning force: $\\tau_c b L_c \\sim F_p(L_c)$.\n\nYour task is to design and implement a complete program that:\n1. Maps atomistic simulation outputs to the theory inputs as follows (these steps must be documented in comments in your code, but the program will directly utilize provided numerical values):\n   - From the atomistic simulation of a dislocation segment embedded in a random alloy, compute the force-per-unit-length signal $f(x)$ along the line coordinate $x$ in steady state at zero external stress. Estimate the variance $\\sigma_f^2$ and the autocorrelation function $C(r) = \\langle f(x) f(x+r) \\rangle_{x}$ via a discrete average over $x$. Then compute the integral correlation length $\\xi = \\frac{1}{C(0)} \\int_0^\\infty C(r)\\, dr$ numerically (e.g., by trapezoidal integration of the discrete correlation).\n   - Compute the line tension $T$ from elastic constants measured or computed for the same atomic configuration. Use $T = \\alpha G b^2$, with geometry factor $\\alpha$ selected by the dislocation character. For an edge dislocation, $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2(1-\\nu)}$; for a screw dislocation, $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}$.

            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the theory of collective pinning of elastic manifolds, specifically the Larkin-Ovchinnikov model applied to dislocations in concentrated alloys. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary physical parameters and analytical expressions to determine a unique, meaningful solution for each test case. All provided data and units are physically and dimensionally consistent.\n\nThe objective is to calibrate a dimensionless prefactor, $A$, in the theoretical model for the critical resolved shear stress (CRSS), $\\tau_{\\mathrm{theory}}$, by using provided \"measured\" values, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{meas}}$, for four distinct scenarios. This involves a multi-step calculation beginning with fundamental material and dislocation properties.\n\nFirst, we establish the theoretical framework as laid out in the problem statement. The core of the model lies in the scaling relations for the forces acting on a dislocation segment of length $L$. The net pinning force, $F_p(L)$, arising from the random solute field, scales as $F_p(L) \\sim \\sigma_f \\sqrt{L \\xi}$, where $\\sigma_f$ is the root-mean-square of the random force per unit length and $\\xi$ is its correlation length. The elastic restoring force, $F_e(L)$, of the dislocation line with tension $T$ and displacement $u$ scales as $F_e(L) \\sim T u / L$.\n\nThe derivation of the key length scale, the Larkin length $L_c$, proceeds by first determining the scaling of the dislocation's displacement $u(L)$ with length $L$. This is found by balancing a typical elastic restoring force with the pinning force causing the displacement: $F_e(L) \\sim F_p(L)$. However, the problem specifies a slightly different, but equivalent, path. It defines the Larkin length $L_c$ as the scale at which the typical displacement $u(L_c)$ becomes comparable to the transverse correlation length of the disorder, here taken as $\\xi$. This condition is expressed as $u(L_c) \\sim \\xi$. To find $L_c$, we start with the force balance $T u(L_c) / L_c \\sim F_p(L_c) \\sim \\sigma_f \\sqrt{L_c \\xi}$. Substituting $u(L_c) \\sim \\xi$ into this balance gives:\n$$\n\\frac{T \\xi}{L_c} \\sim \\sigma_f \\sqrt{L_c \\xi}\n$$\nRearranging to solve for $L_c$:\n$$\nT \\xi \\sim \\sigma_f L_c^{3/2} \\sqrt{\\xi}\n$$\n$$\nT \\sqrt{\\xi} \\sim \\sigma_f L_c^{3/2}\n$$\n$$\nL_c^{3/2} \\sim \\frac{T \\sqrt{\\xi}}{\\sigma_f}\n$$\nSquaring both sides yields $L_c^3 \\sim \\frac{T^2 \\xi}{\\sigma_f^2}$, which leads to the expression for the Larkin length:\n$$\nL_c = \\left( \\frac{T^2 \\xi}{\\sigma_f^2} \\right)^{1/3}\n$$\nThis is the characteristic length of a collectively pinned dislocation segment.\n\nNext, we derive the theoretical critical resolved shear stress, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{theory}}$, denoted as $\\tau_c$ in the derivation. The onset of motion (depinning) occurs when the driving force from an applied stress $\\tau_c$ balances the maximum pinning force. The driving force on a segment of length $L_c$ is the Peach-Koehler force, $F_{app} = \\tau_c b L_c$. The maximum pinning force on this scale is $F_p(L_c) \\sim \\sigma_f \\sqrt{L_c \\xi}$. Equating these forces gives the condition for the CRSS:\n$$\n\\tau_c b L_c \\sim \\sigma_f \\sqrt{L_c \\xi}\n$$\nSolving for $\\tau_c$:\n$$\n\\tau_c \\sim \\frac{\\sigma_f}{b L_c} \\sqrt{L_c \\xi} = \\frac{\\sigma_f}{b} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\xi}{L_c}}\n$$\nTo convert this scaling relation into an equation, we introduce a dimensionless prefactor $A$ that accounts for the geometric factors and numerical constants omitted in the scaling analysis. Thus, the theoretical CRSS is:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{theory}} = A \\cdot \\frac{\\sigma_f}{b} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\xi}{L_c}}\n$$\nThe task is to find a calibrated value of $A$ for each test case by setting $\\tau_{\\mathrm{theory}} = \\tau_{\\mathrm{meas}}$:\n$$\nA = \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{meas}}}{\\frac{\\sigma_f}{b} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\xi}{L_c}}}\n$$\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n1.  Determine the dislocation geometry factor $\\alpha$. For an edge dislocation, $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2(1-\\nu)}$. For a screw dislocation, $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n2.  Calculate the line tension $T$ using $T = \\alpha G b^2$.\n3.  Calculate the Larkin length $L_c = \\left( \\frac{T^2 \\xi}{\\sigma_f^2} \\right)^{1/3}$.\n4.  Substitute all values into the expression for $A$ to find the calibrated prefactor.\n\nWe now apply this procedure to each test case.\n\n**Case 1: General case, edge character**\n-   Given: $G = 80 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$, $\\nu = 0.30$, $b = 2.5 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\sigma_f = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$, $\\xi = 3.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{meas}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$.\n-   Step 1: $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2(1-0.30)} = \\frac{1}{1.4} \\approx 0.714286$.\n-   Step 2: $T = (\\frac{1}{1.4}) \\cdot (80 \\times 10^9) \\cdot (2.5 \\times 10^{-10})^2 \\approx 3.5714 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n-   Step 3: $L_c = \\left( \\frac{(3.5714 \\times 10^{-9})^2 \\cdot (3.0 \\times 10^{-9})}{(1.0 \\times 10^{-3})^2} \\right)^{1/3} \\approx 3.3695 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n-   Step 4: $A = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{6}}{(\\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}}{2.5 \\times 10^{-10}}) \\sqrt{\\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{-9}}{3.3695 \\times 10^{-7}}}} \\approx 2.649516$.\n\n**Case 2: Screw character, stronger disorder**\n-   Given: $G = 80 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$, $\\nu = 0.30$, $b = 2.5 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\sigma_f = 5.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$, $\\xi = 1.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{meas}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$.\n-   Step 1: $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$.\n-   Step 2: $T = 0.5 \\cdot (80 \\times 10^9) \\cdot (2.5 \\times 10^{-10})^2 = 2.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n-   Step 3: $L_c = \\left( \\frac{(2.5 \\times 10^{-9})^2 \\cdot (1.0 \\times 10^{-9})}{(5.0 \\times 10^{-3})^2} \\right)^{1/3} \\approx 6.2996 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n-   Step 4: $A = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{7}}{(\\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{-3}}{2.5 \\times 10^{-10}}) \\sqrt{\\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-9}}{6.2996 \\times 10^{-9}}}} \\approx 1.254958$.\n\n**Case 3: Weak disorder limit, edge character**\n-   Given: $G = 80 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$, $\\nu = 0.30$, $b = 2.5 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\sigma_f = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$, $\\xi = 1.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{meas}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$.\n-   Step 1: $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2(1-0.30)} \\approx 0.714286$.\n-   Step 2: $T = (\\frac{1}{1.4}) \\cdot (80 \\times 10^9) \\cdot (2.5 \\times 10^{-10})^2 \\approx 3.5714 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n-   Step 3: $L_c = \\left( \\frac{(3.5714 \\times 10^{-9})^2 \\cdot (1.0 \\times 10^{-9})}{(1.0 \\times 10^{-6})^2} \\right)^{1/3} \\approx 2.3364 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n-   Step 4: $A = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{3}}{(\\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-6}}{2.5 \\times 10^{-10}}) \\sqrt{\\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-9}}{2.3364 \\times 10^{-5}}}} \\approx 38.214800$.\n\n**Case 4: Long correlation length, edge character**\n-   Given: $G = 80 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$, $\\nu = 0.30$, $b = 2.5 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\sigma_f = 2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$, $\\xi = 3.0 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{meas}} = 4.0 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$.\n-   Step 1: $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2(1-0.30)} \\approx 0.714286$.\n-   Step 2: $T = (\\frac{1}{1.4}) \\cdot (80 \\times 10^9) \\cdot (2.5 \\times 10^{-10})^2 \\approx 3.5714 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n-   Step 3: $L_c = \\left( \\frac{(3.5714 \\times 10^{-9})^2 \\cdot (3.0 \\times 10^{-8})}{(2.0 \\times 10^{-3})^2} \\right)^{1/3} \\approx 4.5735 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n-   Step 4: $A = \\frac{4.0 \\times 10^{6}}{(\\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-3}}{2.5 \\times 10^{-10}}) \\sqrt{\\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{-8}}{4.5735 \\times 10^{-7}}}} \\approx 1.952173$.\n\nThese calculations are implemented in the following program to produce the final results.",
