            "solution": "The equilibrium vacancy fraction, $c_v$, is determined by minimizing the Gibbs free energy of the crystal with respect to the number of vacancies. The change in the Gibbs free energy, $\\Delta G$, upon introducing $n_v$ vacancies into a crystal with $N$ lattice sites can be expressed as the sum of the energy required to form the vacancies and the change in the entropy of the system.\n\nThe total change in Gibbs free energy, $\\Delta G_{total}$, has two components:\n1.  The free energy of formation for $n_v$ non-interacting vacancies. The formation free energy of a single vacancy is $g_f = E_f - TS_f$, where $E_f$ is the vacancy formation energy and $S_f$ is the non-configurational (e.g., vibrational) vacancy formation entropy. For $n_v$ vacancies, this contribution is $n_v g_f = n_v (E_f - TS_f)$.\n2.  The configurational entropy contribution. The number of ways to arrange $n_v$ vacancies on $N$ lattice sites is given by the binomial coefficient $\\Omega = \\binom{N}{n_v} = \\frac{N!}{n_v!(N-n_v)!}$.

The problem states that creep is dominated by dislocation climb, which is rate-limited by vacancy availability. Dislocation climb is a process of mass transport to or from the dislocation line, which occurs via vacancy diffusion. The rate of such processes is typically proportional to the concentration of vacancies, $c_v$, and a vacancy diffusion term. Since the creep rate, $\\dot{\\varepsilon}$, is limited by climb, it must be proportional to the climb velocity, which in turn is proportional to $c_v$. Therefore, $\\dot{\\varepsilon} \\propto c_v$. The calculated ratio $R \\approx 125.9$ means that the equilibrium vacancy concentration is approximately $126$ times greater at $T_2 = 1200\\ \\text{K}$ than at $T_1 = 900\\ \\text{K}$. This dramatic increase in the concentration of available vacancies will lead to a correspondingly large increase in the rate of dislocation climb, and thus a substantial acceleration of the overall creep rate at the higher temperature. This highlights the strong, non-linear temperature dependence of high-temperature creep.",

The two mechanisms are climb-controlled dislocation power-law creep ($\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{PLC}$) and grain-boundary diffusion creep, known as Coble creep ($\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{Coble}$).\n\nThe first-principles origin of these creep equations lies in fundamental transport and force-balance relations.\n\nFor climb-controlled dislocation creep, the macroscopic strain rate is given by the Orowan equation, $\\dot{\\varepsilon} = \\rho_m b v_d$, where $\\rho_m$ is the mobile dislocation density, $b$ is the magnitude of the Burgers vector, and $v_d$ is the average dislocation velocity. In climb-controlled creep, the dislocation velocity is limited by the rate at which dislocations can climb over obstacles. This climb process is mediated by the diffusion of vacancies to or from the dislocation line. The driving force for this diffusion is the stress-induced chemical potential gradient for vacancies. From Fick's first law, the vacancy flux is proportional to the lattice diffusion coefficient, $D_L$. Consequently, the climb velocity and thus the strain rate are directly proportional to $D_L$. The stress dependence arises from the influence of stress on both the dislocation density and the driving force for climb. The resulting expression for the steady-state strain rate is:\n$$\n\\dot{\\varepsilon}_{PLC} = A_{PLC} \\frac{D_L G b}{k_B T} \\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{G}\\right)^n\n$$\nwhere $A_{PLC}$ is a dimensionless material constant, $G$ is the shear modulus, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. The problem specifies a stress exponent $n=4$.\n\nFor Coble creep, the strain is accommodated by the stress-directed diffusional flow of atoms along grain boundaries. The applied stress, $\\sigma$, creates a difference in chemical potential of vacancies between grain boundaries under tension and those under compression, on the order of $\\sigma \\Omega$, where $\\Omega$ is the atomic volume.

            "solution": "### Derivation of the Coble Creep Strain Rate Equation\n\nCoble creep is a mechanism of plastic deformation in polycrystalline materials at high temperatures, where atoms diffuse along grain boundaries. The process is driven by gradients in chemical potential established by an applied stress.\n\n1.  **Chemical Potential Gradient**: Under an applied uniaxial tensile stress $\\sigma$, grain boundaries oriented perpendicular to the stress axis experience tension, while those parallel to the axis experience compression. This stress difference creates a difference in chemical potential $\\Delta \\mu$ for atoms across a grain. The chemical potential $\\mu$ of an atom on a boundary subjected to a normal stress $\\sigma_n$ is given by $\\mu = -\\sigma_n \\Omega$, where $\\Omega$ is the atomic volume. Vacancies have a chemical potential of opposite sign. The potential is higher on compressive faces and lower on tensile faces. This drives a net flux of atoms from boundaries under compression to those under tension. The chemical potential difference across a grain of size $d$ is approximately $\\Delta \\mu \\approx \\sigma \\Omega$. The gradient of the chemical potential can be approximated as $|\\nabla \\mu| \\approx \\frac{\\Delta \\mu}{d} = \\frac{\\sigma \\Omega}{d}$.\n\n2.  **Atomic Flux**: The flux of atoms, $J_a$, is governed by the Nernst-Einstein relation, which is a form of Fick's first law for a potential gradient:\n    $$ J_a = -L \\nabla \\mu $$\n    where $L$ is a transport coefficient. For diffusion, $L$ is related to the diffusion coefficient $D$ by $L = \\frac{D c}{k_B T}$, where $c$ is the concentration of diffusing species. For diffusion of atoms in a solid, the concentration is $c \\approx 1/\\Omega$. The relevant diffusion coefficient for Coble creep is the grain-boundary diffusion coefficient, $D_{gb}$. Thus, the transport coefficient for atoms along the grain boundaries is $L_{gb} \\approx \\frac{D_{gb}}{k_B T \\Omega}$. The atomic flux along the grain boundaries is then:\n    $$ J_a \\approx -\\frac{D_{gb}}{k_B T \\Omega} \\left(-\\frac{\\sigma \\Omega}{d}\\right) = \\frac{D_{gb} \\sigma}{k_B T d} $$\n\n3.  **Material Transport and Strain Rate**: This flux occurs through the cross-sectional area of the grain boundaries, which is the grain-boundary width $\\delta$ multiplied by the grain dimension, approximately $\\delta d$. The total number of atoms transported per unit time, $\\frac{dN}{dt}$, is the flux multiplied by this area:\n    $$ \\frac{dN}{dt} \\approx J_a \\cdot (\\delta d) = \\left(\\frac{D_{gb} \\sigma}{k_B T d}\\right) (\\delta d) = \\frac{D_{gb} \\delta \\sigma}{k_B T} $$\n    Each atom adds a volume $\\Omega$ to the tensile faces of the grain. The rate of volume addition to these faces is $\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\frac{dN}{dt} \\Omega$. This volume change leads to an elongation of the grain, $dL/dt$, in the direction of the applied stress. For a grain of size $d$, the volume change is related to the elongation by $\\frac{dV}{dt} = d^2 \\frac{dL}{dt}$.\n    The uniaxial strain rate $\\dot{\\varepsilon}$ is defined as the rate of elongation per unit length: $\\dot{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{1}{d} \\frac{dL}{dt}$.\n    Combining these expressions, we get:\n    $$ \\dot{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{1}{d} \\frac{dL}{dt} = \\frac{1}{d^3} \\frac{dV}{dt} = \\frac{1}{d^3} \\frac{dN}{dt} \\Omega = \\frac{1}{d^3} \\left(\\frac{D_{gb} \\delta \\sigma}{k_B T}\\right) \\Omega $$\n    $$ \\dot{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{D_{gb} \\delta \\sigma \\Omega}{k_B T d^3} $$\n    A full geometric analysis results in the inclusion of a dimensionless constant, $A$. The final equation for the steady-state Coble creep strain rate is:\n    $$ \\dot{\\varepsilon} = A \\frac{D_{gb} \\delta \\sigma \\Omega}{k_B T d^3} $$\n    This derivation confirms that the strain rate $\\dot{\\varepsilon}$ is directly proportional to the grain-boundary diffusion coefficient $D_{gb}$. The proportionality constant, which we denote as $K$, is:\n    $$ K = \\frac{A \\delta \\sigma \\Omega}{k_B T d^3} $$\n\n### Stochastic Analysis of the Strain Rate\n\nGiven that $\\dot{\\varepsilon} = K \\cdot D_{gb}$ and $D_{gb}$ is a random variable, $\\dot{\\varepsilon}$ is also a random variable. The problem states that $D_{gb}$ follows a lognormal distribution, specified by its logarithm being normally distributed: $\\ln(D_{gb}) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{\\ln}, s_{\\ln}^2)$.\n\n1.  **Distribution of the Strain Rate**: Since $K$ is a positive constant for fixed material and thermomechanical parameters, we can take the natural logarithm of the strain rate equation:\n    $$ \\ln(\\dot{\\varepsilon}) = \\ln(K \\cdot D_{gb}) = \\ln(K) + \\ln(D_{gb}) $$\n    Because $\\ln(D_{gb})$ is a normally distributed random variable and $\\ln(K)$ is a constant, their sum, $\\ln(\\dot{\\varepsilon})$, is also a normally distributed random variable. Let $\\ln(\\dot{\\varepsilon}) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{\\dot{\\varepsilon}}, s_{\\dot{\\varepsilon}}^2)$. The parameters of this distribution are:\n    -   Mean: $\\mu_{\\dot{\\varepsilon}} = E[\\ln(\\dot{\\varepsilon})] = \\ln(K) + E[\\ln(D_{gb})] = \\ln(K) + \\mu_{\\ln}$.\n    -   Variance: $s_{\\dot{\\varepsilon}}^2 = \\text{Var}(\\ln(\\dot{\\varepsilon})) = \\text{Var}(\\ln(K) + \\ln(D_{gb})) = \\text{Var}(\\ln(D_{gb})) = s_{\\ln}^2$.\n    Therefore, the strain rate $\\dot{\\varepsilon}$ itself follows a lognormal distribution, $\\dot{\\varepsilon} \\sim \\text{Lognormal}(\\mu_{\\dot{\\varepsilon}}, s_{\\ln}^2)$, where $\\mu_{\\dot{\\varepsilon}} = \\mu_{\\ln} + \\ln\\left(\\frac{A \\delta \\sigma \\Omega}{k_B T d^3}\\right)$.\n\n2.  **Calculation of Statistical Quantities**: For a random variable $X \\sim \\text{Lognormal}(\\mu, s^2)$, its mean and standard deviation are given by:\n    -   Mean: $E[X] = \\exp(\\mu + s^2/2)$\n    -   Standard Deviation: $\\text{StdDev}[X] = \\sqrt{(\\exp(s^2) - 1)\\exp(2\\mu + s^2)} = E[X]\\sqrt{\\exp(s^2) - 1}$\n\n    Applying these formulas to $\\dot{\\varepsilon} \\sim \\text{Lognormal}(\\mu_{\\dot{\\varepsilon}}, s_{\\ln}^2)$:\n    -   Mean of $\\dot{\\varepsilon}$: $E[\\dot{\\varepsilon}] = \\exp\\left(\\mu_{\\dot{\\varepsilon}} + \\frac{s_{\\ln}^2}{2}\\right)$\n    -   Standard Deviation of $\\dot{\\varepsilon}$: $\\text{StdDev}[\\dot{\\varepsilon}] = E[\\dot{\\varepsilon}]\\sqrt{\\exp(s_{\\ln}^2) - 1}$\n\n3.  **Confidence Interval**: A two-sided $95\\%$ confidence interval for $\\dot{\\varepsilon}$ is derived from the corresponding interval for $\\ln(\\dot{\\varepsilon})$. For $\\ln(\\dot{\\varepsilon}) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_{\\dot{\\varepsilon}}, s_{\\ln}^2)$, the $95\\%$ confidence interval is $[\\mu_{\\dot{\\varepsilon}} - z_{0.025}s_{\\ln}, \\mu_{\\dot{\\varepsilon}} + z_{0.025}s_{\\ln}]$, where $z_{0.025}$ is the critical value from the standard normal distribution corresponding to a cumulative probability of $0.975$ ($z_{0.025} \\approx 1.95996$). By exponentiating the interval boundaries, we get the confidence interval for $\\dot{\\varepsilon}$:\n    -   Lower Bound ($L$): $L = \\exp(\\mu_{\\dot{\\varepsilon}} - z_{0.025}s_{\\ln})$\n    -   Upper Bound ($U$): $U = \\exp(\\mu_{\\dot{\\varepsilon}} + z_{0.025}s_{\\ln})$\n\nThe algorithm for the program will implement these final formulas for each given test case, ensuring units are consistent ($T$ in K, $\\sigma$ in Pa, $d$ in m).",
