## Introduction
High-entropy ceramics and oxides (HECs/HEOs) represent a rapidly emerging class of materials, defined by their unique compositional complexity—typically comprising five or more principal elements in near-equimolar ratios. This complexity gives rise to novel and often superior properties, making them promising candidates for a wide range of demanding applications, from thermal [barrier coatings](@entry_id:160371) to [solid-state electrolytes](@entry_id:269434). However, the vast compositional space available for creating HECs/HEOs presents a formidable challenge: a trial-and-error experimental approach is impractical for navigating this landscape. This creates a critical knowledge gap that can only be bridged by developing a robust theoretical understanding and powerful [predictive modeling](@entry_id:166398) capabilities.

This article provides a comprehensive theoretical and computational foundation for understanding, predicting, and designing [high-entropy ceramics](@entry_id:1126062) and oxides. It is structured to guide you from core concepts to practical application and advanced modeling techniques. The first chapter, **Principles and Mechanisms**, dissects the foundational thermodynamic concepts, such as configurational entropy and Gibbs free energy, and the structural rules that govern HEC/HEO formation. We will also introduce the essential computational tools, including the Special Quasirandom Structure (SQS) method and Machine Learning Potentials (MLPs), used to model their inherently disordered state.

Next, in **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, we will explore how these principles are leveraged in practice. This chapter demonstrates how [computational thermodynamics](@entry_id:161871) predicts phase stability, how multiscale modeling connects atomic-scale features to macroscopic properties like oxidation resistance, and how the entire field is built upon a synergistic interplay between materials physics, computational science, and [theoretical chemistry](@entry_id:199050).

Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** section provides a set of targeted problems designed to solidify these concepts. Through these exercises, you will gain practical experience in calculating entropy in complex structures, deducing crystal structures from experimental data, and understanding the construction of the advanced computational models that are essential for accelerating the discovery and development of this exciting new family of materials.

## Principles and Mechanisms

This chapter delves into the fundamental thermodynamic and structural principles that govern the formation of [high-entropy ceramics](@entry_id:1126062) and oxides (HECs/HEOs). We will explore the mechanisms by which compositional complexity gives rise to their unique structures and properties, and we will introduce the key theoretical and computational frameworks used to model and understand these materials.

### The Thermodynamic Rationale: Configurational Entropy and Stability

The defining characteristic of a high-entropy material is the stabilization of a single-phase [solid solution](@entry_id:157599), often in a simple crystal lattice, despite being composed of multiple elements that might otherwise form separate phases. The thermodynamic basis for this phenomenon lies in the competition between enthalpy and entropy as described by the Gibbs [free energy of mixing](@entry_id:185318), $\Delta G_{\text{mix}} = \Delta H_{\text{mix}} - T \Delta S_{\text{mix}}$. While the mixing of chemically dissimilar elements often leads to a positive [enthalpy of mixing](@entry_id:142439) ($\Delta H_{\text{mix}} > 0$), which favors [phase separation](@entry_id:143918), the formation of a multicomponent random [solid solution](@entry_id:157599) generates a large [configurational entropy](@entry_id:147820), $\Delta S_{\text{mix}}$. At sufficiently high temperatures, the entropic term, $-T \Delta S_{\text{mix}}$, can become dominant, making the Gibbs free energy of the single-phase solution lower than that of any competing multiphase assemblage.

The [configurational entropy](@entry_id:147820) is a measure of the number of ways the constituent atoms can be arranged on the crystal lattice sites. Its value can be derived from the Boltzmann relation, $S = k_B \ln W$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $W$ is the number of possible microscopic arrangements (microstates) corresponding to the macroscopic state. For an ideal random [solid solution](@entry_id:157599) of $N$ atoms distributed among $N$ sites, with $K$ components having mole fractions $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_K$, the number of ways to arrange the atoms is given by the [multinomial coefficient](@entry_id:262287) $W = N! / (N_1! N_2! \dots N_K!)$, where $N_i = x_i N$. Using Stirling's approximation for large $N$, the molar [configurational entropy](@entry_id:147820) of mixing, $S_{\text{config}}$, simplifies to the well-known [ideal mixing](@entry_id:150763) formula:

$$
S_{\text{config}} = -R \sum_{i=1}^{K} x_i \ln(x_i)
$$

where $R$ is the [universal gas constant](@entry_id:136843). This equation reveals that the entropy is maximized when the components are present in equimolar fractions. For a five-component equimolar system ($x_i=0.2$ for all $i$), the ideal configurational entropy is $S_{\text{config}} = -R \sum_{i=1}^{5} 0.2 \ln(0.2) \approx 1.61 R$. This substantial entropic contribution is the cornerstone of the "high-entropy" stabilization effect.

Many ceramics, unlike metallic alloys, possess multiple distinct sublattices. In such cases, the total configurational entropy is the sum of the contributions from each sublattice, assuming the arrangements on them are independent. This is particularly relevant in HEOs where aliovalent cations (cations with different charges) are introduced, leading to the formation of charge-compensating defects like oxygen vacancies on the anion sublattice.

Consider, for example, a high-entropy oxide with the [fluorite structure](@entry_id:160563), where the cation sublattice is occupied by multiple species and the anion sublattice contains both oxide ions and vacancies . The total molar configurational entropy, $S_{m, \text{config}}$, is the sum of the molar entropies of the cation and anion sublattices:

$$
S_{m, \text{config}} = S_{m, \text{cat}} + S_{m, \text{an}}
$$

The contribution from each sublattice is calculated using the [ideal mixing](@entry_id:150763) formula, scaled by the number of sites of that type per [formula unit](@entry_id:145960). For a [fluorite structure](@entry_id:160563) with one cation site and two anion sites per [formula unit](@entry_id:145960), the cation entropy is $S_{m, \text{cat}} = -(1) \cdot R \sum y_i \ln(y_i)$, where $y_i$ are the cation site fractions. The anion entropy is $S_{m, \text{an}} = -(2) \cdot R \sum x_j \ln(x_j)$, where $x_j$ are the site fractions of oxide ions and vacancies on the anion sublattice. The crucial step is to determine these anion site fractions. This is achieved by enforcing the principle of **[charge neutrality](@entry_id:138647)**. The average charge of the cation sublattice dictates the required number of anions to balance the charge, and thus determines the concentration of vacancies. For instance, if a fluorite oxide contains a mix of $4+$ and $3+$ cations resulting in an average cation charge of $+3.40$, then to maintain neutrality, there must be $1.70$ oxide ions ($\mathrm{O}^{2-}$) per [formula unit](@entry_id:145960). Since the [fluorite structure](@entry_id:160563) provides two anion sites, this implies that $0.30$ sites are vacant. The site fractions on the anion sublattice are therefore $x_{\mathrm{O}} = 1.70/2 = 0.85$ and $x_{\mathrm{Va}} = 0.30/2 = 0.15$. The total [configurational entropy](@entry_id:147820) then includes contributions from both the random mixing of five cation species on their sublattice and the random mixing of oxide ions and vacancies on theirs, leading to a significantly higher total entropy than from the cation sublattice alone .

While high entropy favors single-phase formation, it does not guarantee it. The ultimate arbiter of stability is whether the Gibbs free energy of the single phase lies on the **lower convex envelope** of the free energy surface as a function of composition. If a composition's free energy lies above the [tangent plane](@entry_id:136914) (or a line connecting two other compositions in a multicomponent system), it is unstable with respect to decomposition into a mixture of phases. The CALPHAD (Computer Coupling of Phase Diagrams and Thermochemistry) methodology provides a powerful framework for assessing this stability . In the CALPHAD approach, the Gibbs free energy of each phase is described by a parameterized model. For a solid solution, this model typically includes the reference energies of the components, the ideal [mixing entropy](@entry_id:161398), and an **excess energy** term that accounts for non-ideal interactions:

$$
G_m(\boldsymbol{x}, T) = \sum_{i} x_i G_i^0(T) + RT \sum_{i} x_i \ln x_i + G^{\text{ex}}(\boldsymbol{x}, T)
$$

where $G^{\text{ex}}$ is the excess Gibbs energy term capturing non-ideal interactions, typically modeled using polynomials based on binary and [ternary system](@entry_id:261533) data.
