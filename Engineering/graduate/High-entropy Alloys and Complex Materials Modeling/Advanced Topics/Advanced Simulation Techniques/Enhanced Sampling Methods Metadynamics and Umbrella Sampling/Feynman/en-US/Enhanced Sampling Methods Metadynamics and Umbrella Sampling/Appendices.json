A solution will now be derived.\n\nThe problem requires us to determine the minimal hill deposition stride, $\\tau_{\\text{dep}}$, based on a specified independence criterion. The criterion is formulated in terms of the normalized autocorrelation function, $C(t)$, of the chosen collective variable.\n\nThe model for the autocorrelation function is given as an exponential decay:\n$$\nC(t) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{\\text{corr}}}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\tau_{\\text{corr}}$ is the integrated autocorrelation time.\n\nThe independence criterion that must be satisfied is:\n$$\nC(\\tau_{\\text{dep}}) \\leq \\exp(-2)\n$$\nThis condition ensures that the correlation between system configurations at the moments of successive bias potential depositions is smaller than a certain threshold, here chosen to be $\\exp(-2)$.\n\nTo find the constraint on $\\tau_{\\text{dep}}$, we substitute the expression for $C(t)$ into the inequality:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\tau_{\\text{dep}}}{\\tau_{\\text{corr}}}\\right) \\leq \\exp(-2)\n$$\nTo solve for $\\tau_{\\text{dep}}$, we can take the natural logarithm of both sides of the inequality. Since the natural logarithm, $\\ln(x)$, is a monotonically increasing function, the direction of the inequality is preserved:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\tau_{\\text{dep}}}{\\tau_{\\text{corr}}}\\right)\\right) \\leq \\ln\\left(\\exp(-2)\\right)\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\tau_{\\text{dep}}}{\\tau_{\\text{corr}}} \\leq -2\n$$\nNext, we multiply both sides by $-1$. This operation reverses the direction of the inequality sign:\n$$\n\\frac{\\tau_{\\text{dep}}}{\\tau_{\\text{corr}}} \\geq 2\n$$\nFinally, we solve for $\\tau_{\\text{dep}}$ by multiplying by $\\tau_{\\text{corr}}$ (which is a positive quantity):\n$$\n\\tau_{\\text{dep}} \\geq 2 \\tau_{\\text{corr}}\n$$\nThis result indicates that the deposition stride must be at least twice the autocorrelation time of the collective variable to satisfy the given criterion.\n\nThe problem asks for the *minimal* hill deposition stride. The minimal value of $\\tau_{\\text{dep}}$ that satisfies this condition corresponds to the equality:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\text{dep,min}} = 2 \\tau_{\\text{corr}}\n$$\nWe are given the numerical value for the integrated autocorrelation time, $\\tau_{\\text{corr}} = 0.673\\,\\text{ns}$. Substituting this value into the equation for $\\tau_{\\text{dep,min}}$:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\text{dep,min}} = 2 \\times 0.673\\,\\text{ns}\n$$\nPerforming the multiplication gives:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\text{dep,min}} = 1.346\\,\\text{ns}\n$$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.

In an umbrella sampling simulation window $k$, the system is subject to a total effective potential, or potential of mean force, $W_{k}(s)$, which is the sum of the unbiased free energy $F(s)$ and the applied bias potential $U_{k}(s)$.\n$$W_{k}(s) = F(s) + U_{k}(s)$$\nAccording to statistical mechanics, the probability of observing the system at a particular value of the collective variable $s$ is given by the Boltzmann distribution:\n$$P_{k}^{\\text{bias}}(s) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{W_{k}(s)}{k_{B}T}\\right)$$\nThe problem states that near the center of the umbrella window $s_k$, the unbiased free energy can be approximated by a quadratic form, and the bias is explicitly harmonic:\n$$F(s) \\approx F(s_{k}) + \\frac{1}{2} c_{k} (s - s_{k})^{2}$$\n$$U_{k}(s) = \\frac{1}{2} \\kappa_{k} (s - s_{k})^{2}$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for the total effective potential $W_{k}(s)$:\n$$W_{k}(s) \\approx \\left( F(s_{k}) + \\frac{1}{2} c_{k} (s - s_{k})^{2} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\kappa_{k} (s - s_{k})^{2} \\right)$$\n$$W_{k}(s) \\approx F(s_{k}) + \\frac{1}{2} (c_{k} + \\kappa_{k}) (s - s_{k})^{2}$$\nThe biased probability distribution $P_{k}^{\\text{bias}}(s)$ is then:\n$$P_{k}^{\\text{bias}}(s) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{F(s_{k}) + \\frac{1}{2} (c_{k} + \\kappa_{k}) (s - s_{k})^{2}}{k_{B}T}\\right)$$\nSince $F(s_{k})$ is a constant for a given window, we can absorb the term $\\exp(-F(s_{k}) / (k_{B}T))$ into the normalization constant:\n$$P_{k}^{\\text{bias}}(s) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(c_{k} + \\kappa_{k})(s - s_{k})^{2}}{2k_{B}T}\\right)$$\nThis is the functional form of a Gaussian (normal) distribution for the variable $s$ with mean $\\mu = s_{k}$. The general form for a Gaussian probability density function is:\n$$f(x; \\mu, \\sigma^2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)$$\nBy comparing the exponent in our distribution for $s$ with the general Gaussian form, we can identify the variance $\\sigma_k^2$:\n$$\\frac{(s - s_{k})^2}{2\\sigma_{k}^2} = \\frac{(c_{k} + \\kappa_{k})(s - s_{k})^{2}}{2k_{B}T}$$\nThis implies:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\sigma_{k}^2} = \\frac{c_{k} + \\kappa_{k}}{k_{B}T}$$\nThis equation relates the variance $\\sigma_{k}^2$ of the sampled CV in window $k$ to the intrinsic curvature $c_k$ of the free energy landscape and the applied bias spring constant $\\kappa_k$. The problem requires us to find the spring constant $\\kappa_k$ that results in a *desired* standard deviation $\\sigma_k$. We rearrange the equation to solve for $\\kappa_k$:\n$$c_{k} + \\kappa_{k} = \\frac{k_{B}T}{\\sigma_{k}^2}$$\n$$\\kappa_{k} = \\frac{k_{B}T}{\\sigma_{k}^2} - c_{k}$$\nThis is the required general expression for the spring constant.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical values for $\\kappa_{1}$, $\\kappa_{2}$, and $\\kappa_{3}$.

Here, $a = 1/\\sigma^2$, so the integral evaluates to $\\sqrt{\\pi\\sigma^2} = \\sigma\\sqrt{\\pi}$.\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} p_{1}(s)^{2}\\,ds = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sigma^2} (\\sigma\\sqrt{\\pi}) = \\frac{1}{2\\sigma\\sqrt{\\pi}}\n$$\nThe denominator of $\\mathcal{O}$ is therefore $\\sqrt{(\\frac{1}{2\\sigma\\sqrt{\\pi}})^2} = \\frac{1}{2\\sigma\\sqrt{\\pi}}$.\n\nNext, we compute the numerator, $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} p_{1}(s)\\,p_{2}(s)\\,ds$:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} p_1(s) p_2(s) ds = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sigma^2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{s^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(s-\\delta)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) ds\n$$\nWe combine the exponents:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} \\left[s^2 + (s-\\delta)^2\\right] = -\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} [s^2 + s^2 - 2s\\delta + \\delta^2] = -\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} [2s^2 - 2s\\delta + \\delta^2]\n$$\nWe complete the square for the terms involving $s$:\n$$\n2s^2 - 2s\\delta = 2\\left(s^2 - s\\delta\\right) = 2\\left( (s-\\frac{\\delta}{2})^2 - \\frac{\\delta^2}{4} \\right) = 2(s-\\frac{\\delta}{2})^2 - \\frac{\\delta^2}{2}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the exponent:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} \\left[2(s-\\frac{\\delta}{2})^2 - \\frac{\\delta^2}{2} + \\delta^2\\right] = -\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2} \\left[2(s-\\frac{\\delta}{2})^2 + \\frac{\\delta^2}{2}\\right] = -\\frac{(s-\\delta/2)^2}{\\sigma^2} - \\frac{\\delta^2}{4\\sigma^2}\n$$\nThe integral becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sigma^2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(s-\\delta/2)^2}{\\sigma^2} - \\frac{\\delta^2}{4\\sigma^2}\\right) ds = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sigma^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\delta^2}{4\\sigma^2}\\right) \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(s-\\delta/2)^2}{\\sigma^2}\\right) ds\n$$\nThe remaining integral is again a Gaussian integral with $a = 1/\\sigma^2$, which evaluates to $\\sigma\\sqrt{\\pi}$.\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} p_1(s) p_2(s) ds = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sigma^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\delta^2}{4\\sigma^2}\\right) (\\sigma\\sqrt{\\pi}) = \\frac{1}{2\\sigma\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\delta^2}{4\\sigma^2}\\right)\n$$\nFinally, we compute the ratio for $\\mathcal{O}$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{O} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2\\sigma\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\delta^2}{4\\sigma^2}\\right)}{\\frac{1}{2\\sigma\\sqrt{\\pi}}} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\delta^2}{4\\sigma^2}\\right)\n$$\n\n**3) Optimal spacing multiplier $\\alpha^{\\ast}$**\n\nThe total number of windows $N$ to cover a CV range of width $\\Delta s$ with a uniform spacing $\\delta$ is $N= \\lceil \\Delta s / \\delta \\rceil$. To minimize $N$, which is a non-decreasing function of $1/\\delta$, we must maximize the window spacing $\\delta$.\nThe spacing is constrained by $\\delta = \\alpha\\sigma$ with $\\alpha \\in [1, 2]$. Maximizing $\\delta$ is equivalent to maximizing $\\alpha$.\nThe choice of $\\alpha$ is further constrained by the minimum overlap requirement, $\\mathcal{O} \\ge \\mathcal{O}_{\\min}$. Substituting our expression for $\\mathcal{O}$:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\delta^2}{4\\sigma^2}\\right) \\ge \\mathcal{O}_{\\min}\n$$\nReplacing $\\delta$ with $\\alpha\\sigma$:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\alpha\\sigma)^2}{4\\sigma^2}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha^2}{4}\\right) \\ge \\mathcal{O}_{\\min}\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides (a monotonic function, so the inequality is preserved):\n$$\n-\\frac{\\alpha^2}{4} \\ge \\ln(\\mathcal{O}_{\\min})\n$$\nMultiplying by $-4$ reverses the inequality:\n$$\n\\alpha^2 \\le -4\\ln(\\mathcal{O}_{\\min})\n$$\nSince $\\alpha$ is positive, we can take the square root:\n$$\n\\alpha \\le \\sqrt{-4\\ln(\\mathcal{O}_{\\min})}\n$$\nWe have two upper bounds on $\\alpha$: $\\alpha \\le 2$ and $\\alpha \\le \\sqrt{-4\\ln(\\mathcal{O}_{\\min})}$. To satisfy both, $\\alpha$ must be less than or equal to the smaller of the two. To maximize $\\alpha$, we choose the largest possible value, which is this minimum. Therefore, the optimal value $\\alpha^{\\ast}$ is:\n$$\n\\alpha^{\\ast} = \\min\\left(2, \\sqrt{-4\\ln(\\mathcal{O}_{\\min})}\\right)\n$$\nWe must evaluate the second term using the given $\\mathcal{O}_{\\min} = 0.5$:\n$$\n\\sqrt{-4\\ln(0.5)} = \\sqrt{-4(-\\ln(2))} = \\sqrt{4\\ln(2)} = 2\\sqrt{\\ln(2)}\n$$\nUsing the approximation $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693$, we get $\\alpha^{\\ast} \\approx 2\\sqrt{0.693} \\approx 2 \\times 0.8326 = 1.6652$. Since $1 < 1.6652 < 2$, this value is within the allowed range $[1,2]$ and is more restrictive than the upper bound of $2$.\nThus, the optimal spacing multiplier is $\\alpha^{\\ast} = 2\\sqrt{\\ln(2)}$.\n\n**4) Minimal number of windows $N^{\\ast}$**\n\nWe now compute the minimal integer number of windows, $N^{\\ast}$, by first calculating the numerical values for $\\sigma$ and the optimal spacing $\\delta^{\\ast}$.\nThe given parameters are:\n$T = 1200\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n$k = 40\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n$k_B = 8.617333262 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV/K}$\n$\\Delta s = 1.2$\n\nFirst, calculate the thermal energy $k_B T$:\n$$\nk_B T = (8.617333262 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV/K}) \\times (1200\\,\\mathrm{K}) = 0.103407999144\\,\\mathrm{eV}\n$$\nNext, calculate the biased standard deviation $\\sigma$:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_B T}{k}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.103407999144\\,\\mathrm{eV}}{40\\,\\mathrm{eV}}} = \\sqrt{0.0025851999786} \\approx 0.05084486\n$$\nThe optimal spacing multiplier $\\alpha^{\\ast}$ is:\n$$\n\\alpha^{\\ast} = 2\\sqrt{\\ln(2)} \\approx 1.66510922\n$$\nThe optimal spacing $\\delta^{\\ast}$ is:\n$$\n\\delta^{\\ast} = \\alpha^{\\ast} \\sigma = (1.66510922) \\times (0.05084486) \\approx 0.0846615\n$$\nThe number of windows $N$ required to span the range $\\Delta s=1.2$ is given by the ceiling of the ratio of the range to the spacing. The minimal number of windows $N^{\\ast}$ corresponds to the maximum possible spacing $\\delta^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nN^{\\ast} = \\left\\lceil \\frac{\\Delta s}{\\delta^{\\ast}} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil \\frac{1.2}{0.0846615} \\right\\rceil\n$$\nCalculating the ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{1.2}{0.0846615} \\approx 14.1746\n$$\nApplying the ceiling function, which gives the smallest integer not less than the argument:\n$$\nN^{\\ast} = \\lceil 14.1746 \\rceil = 15\n$$\nTherefore, a minimum of 15 windows are required to cover the specified range of the collective variable while satisfying the overlap constraint.",
