            "introduction": "The foundation of crystal plasticity lies in understanding how a macroscopic stress state translates into a driving force for slip on specific crystallographic planes. This driving force, the resolved shear stress, is not uniform across all potential slip systems; its magnitude depends critically on the orientation of the crystal lattice relative to the applied load. This fundamental exercise  will guide you through the calculation of resolved shear stress, a critical first step in predicting which slip systems will activate and initiate plastic deformation.",

            "introduction": "While small-strain theories are useful, many real-world metal forming processes involve large deformations, requiring a more sophisticated kinematic framework.

The dyadic product $s \\otimes n$ is:\n$$\ns \\otimes n = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nLet's denote this matrix by $M$. The plastic deformation gradient $F_p$ is found by integrating the flow rule $\\dot{F}_p = L_p F_p$. Assuming an initially undeformed state, $F_p(0) = I$, we integrate over the total plastic shear amount $\\gamma_p = \\int \\dot{\\gamma}_{\\text{slip}} dt$. The solution to the differential equation is the matrix exponential:\n$$\nF_p = \\exp(\\gamma_p M)\n$$\nTo compute the exponential, we examine powers of $M$:\n$$\nM^{2} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSince $M^2$ is the zero matrix, all higher powers are also zero.

For an elastic material, the strain energy density is a positive definite function of the elastic strain, and its absolute minimum (zero) occurs if and only if the elastic strain is zero. Zero elastic strain ($E_e = 0$) implies that the elastic right Cauchy-Green tensor is the identity, $C_e = F_e^T F_e = I$. This is the definition of $F_e$ being an orthogonal matrix (a pure rotation).\n\nWe impose this condition on our expression for $F_e$. For $F_e$ to be a rotation matrix, its columns must form an orthonormal set. The first column vector has length 1. For the second column vector, its length must be 1:\n$$ \\|v_2\\|^2 = (\\gamma - \\gamma_p)^2 + 1^2 + 0^2 = 1 $$\nThis implies $(\\gamma - \\gamma_p)^2 = 0$, which requires $\\gamma_p = \\gamma$. This condition also ensures that the first and second columns are orthogonal, as their dot product is $\\gamma - \\gamma_p$. With $\\gamma_p = \\gamma$, all orthonormality conditions are satisfied. This means that the plastic slip must fully accommodate the macroscopic shear deformation to minimize elastic energy.\n\n#### Final Expression for $F_e$\n\nSubstituting $\\gamma_p = \\gamma$ into the expression for $F_e$:\n$$\nF_e = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\gamma - \\gamma & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = I\n$$\nThe resulting elastic deformation gradient is the identity matrix, which corresponds to zero elastic strain and is consistent with the problem's assumption of negligible lattice rotation.",
