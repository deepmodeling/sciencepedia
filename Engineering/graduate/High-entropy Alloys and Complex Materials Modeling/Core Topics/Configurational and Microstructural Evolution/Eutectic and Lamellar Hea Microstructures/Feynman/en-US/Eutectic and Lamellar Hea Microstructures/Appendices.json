The problem exhibits no scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Critical Thermal Gradient ($G_c$)\n\nThe analysis begins with the solute distribution ahead of a planar solid-liquid interface moving at a constant velocity $R$. Let $z$ be the spatial coordinate pointing into the liquid from the interface at $z=0$. The steady-state mass transport for each solute $i$ in the moving frame is described by:\n$$D_i \\frac{d^2 C_i}{dz^2} + R \\frac{d C_i}{dz} = 0$$\nThis is a second-order linear ordinary differential equation for the concentration profile of solute $i$, $C_i(z)$, in the liquid. The general solution is:\n$$C_i(z) = A_i \\exp\\left(-\\frac{R}{D_i}z\\right) + B_i$$\nwhere $A_i$ and $B_i$ are integration constants determined by boundary conditions.\n\nThe boundary conditions are:\n$1.$ Far from the interface ($z \\to \\infty$), the concentration is the bulk alloy composition: $C_i(\\infty) = C_{0,i}$. This implies $B_i = C_{0,i}$.\n$2.$ At the interface ($z=0$), steady-state solidification requires the composition of the forming solid to be the bulk liquid composition, $C_{s,i}^* = C_{0,i}$. From the partition equilibrium, $k_i = C_{s,i}^*/C_{l,i}^*$, the liquid concentration at the interface is $C_l^*(z=0) \\equiv C_i(0) = C_{s,i}^*/k_i = C_{0,i}/k_i$.\n\nApplying the second boundary condition to the solution:\n$$C_i(0) = A_i + C_{0,i} = \\frac{C_{0,i}}{k_i}$$\nSolving for $A_i$:\n$$A_i = \\frac{C_{0,i}}{k_i} - C_{0,i} = C_{0,i} \\left(\\frac{1-k_i}{k_i}\\right)$$\nSubstituting the constants back, the solute distribution in the liquid is:\n$$C_i(z) = C_{0,i} \\left[ 1 + \\left(\\frac{1-k_i}{k_i}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{R}{D_i}z\\right) \\right]$$\nThis solute pile-up at the interface lowers the local equilibrium liquidus temperature, $T_L$. The liquidus temperature profile is given by:\n$$T_L(z) = T_m - \\sum_{i} m_i C_i(z)$$\nConstitutional supercooling occurs when the actual temperature gradient in the liquid, $G$, is insufficient to overcome the gradient of the liquidus temperature. To maintain a stable planar front, the actual temperature gradient must be greater than or equal to the liquidus temperature gradient at the interface:\n$$G \\ge \\left. \\frac{dT_L}{dz} \\right|_{z=0}$$\nThe critical thermal gradient, $G_c$, is the minimum gradient required for stability:\n$$G_c = \\left. \\frac{dT_L}{dz} \\right|_{z=0}$$\nTo find this, we differentiate $T_L(z)$ with respect to $z$:\n$$\\frac{dT_L}{dz} = - \\sum_{i} m_i \\frac{dC_i}{dz}$$\nThe derivative of the concentration profile is:\n$$\\frac{dC_i}{dz} = C_{0,i} \\left(\\frac{1-k_i}{k_i}\\right) \\left(-\\frac{R}{D_i}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{R}{D_i}z\\right)$$\nEvaluating this at the interface ($z=0$):\n$$\\left. \\frac{dC_i}{dz} \\right|_{z=0} = - \\frac{R}{D_i} C_{0,i} \\left(\\frac{1-k_i}{k_i}\\right)$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the liquidus gradient at the interface:\n$$G_c = - \\sum_{i} m_i \\left[ - \\frac{R}{D_i} C_{0,i} \\left(\\frac{1-k_i}{k_i}\\right) \\right]$$\nThis simplifies to the final expression for the critical thermal gradient for a multicomponent alloy:\n$$G_c = R \\sum_{i} \\frac{m_i C_{0,i} (1-k_i)}{D_i k_i}$$\n\n### Numerical Calculation\n\nWe calculate the contribution of each solute to the sum. The term to be calculated for each solute $i$ is $\\mathcal{T}_i = \\frac{m_i C_{0,i} (1-k_i)}{D_i k_i}$.\n\n- For Aluminum (Al):\n$$\\mathcal{T}_{\\mathrm{Al}} = \\frac{(520) (0.15) (1 - 0.35)}{(3.0 \\times 10^{-9}) (0.35)} = \\frac{50.7}{1.05 \\times 10^{-9}} \\approx 4.8286 \\times 10^{10} \\, \\mathrm{K \\cdot s / m^2}$$\n\n- For Cobalt (Co):\n$$\\mathcal{T}_{\\mathrm{Co}} = \\frac{(180) (0.20) (1 - 0.80)}{(2.5 \\times 10^{-9}) (0.80)} = \\frac{7.2}{2.0 \\times 10^{-9}} = 3.6 \\times 10^{9} \\, \\mathrm{K \\cdot s / m^2}$$\n\n- For Chromium (Cr):\n$$\\mathcal{T}_{\\mathrm{Cr}} = \\frac{(240) (0.25) (1 - 0.60)}{(2.0 \\times 10^{-9}) (0.60)} = \\frac{24}{1.2 \\times 10^{-9}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{10} \\, \\mathrm{K \\cdot s / m^2}$$\n\n- For Iron (Fe):\n$$\\mathcal{T}_{\\mathrm{Fe}} = \\frac{(200) (0.20) (1 - 0.70)}{(2.2 \\times 10^{-9}) (0.70)} = \\frac{12}{1.54 \\times 10^{-9}} \\approx 7.7922 \\times 10^{9} \\, \\mathrm{K \\cdot s / m^2}$$\n\nNow, we sum these contributions:\n$$\\sum_{i} \\mathcal{T}_i = \\mathcal{T}_{\\mathrm{Al}} + \\mathcal{T}_{\\mathrm{Co}} + \\mathcal{T}_{\\mathrm{Cr}} + \\mathcal{T}_{\\mathrm{Fe}}$$\n$$\\sum_{i} \\mathcal{T}_i \\approx (4.8286 \\times 10^{10}) + (0.36 \\times 10^{10}) + (2.0 \\times 10^{10}) + (0.77922 \\times 10^{10})$$\n$$\\sum_{i} \\mathcal{T}_i \\approx 7.9678 \\times 10^{10} \\, \\mathrm{K \\cdot s / m^2}$$\n\nFinally, we multiply by the pulling rate $R = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\mathrm{\\,m/s}$:\n$$G_c = R \\sum_{i} \\mathcal{T}_i = (5.0 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times (7.9678 \\times 10^{10})$$\n$$G_c \\approx 39.839 \\times 10^5 \\, \\mathrm{K/m} = 3.9839 \\times 10^6 \\, \\mathrm{K/m}$$\n\nRounding the result to three significant figures as requested:\n$$G_c \\approx 3.98 \\times 10^6 \\, \\mathrm{K/m}$$",

The physical principles cited—the Gibbs–Thomson effect, Fick's law, and mass conservation—are the correct foundations for modeling this process. The resulting kinetic law, $\\lambda(t)^3 - \\lambda_0^3 = Bt$, is a classical result for diffusion-controlled coarsening (a variant of the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner theory). The Hall-Petch relation is a fundamental concept in the mechanical behavior of crystalline materials. The provided numerical values for spacing, temperature, kinetic parameter, and strength coefficients are physically plausible for high-entropy alloys and other metallic systems. The problem is well-posed and self-contained, as it provides the lumped kinetic parameter $B$, obviating the need for individual component properties like interfacial energy or diffusivity. The objectives are clear and achievable with the given information.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Calculation\n\nThe problem consists of two parts: first, determining the time required for the lamellar spacing to double, and second, calculating the resulting yield strength.\n\n**Part 1: Coarsening Kinetics and Time to Double Spacing**\n\nThe coarsening of the lamellar microstructure is driven by the reduction of total interfacial free energy. This process is mediated by the diffusion of constituent atoms from regions of high curvature (and thus high chemical potential) to regions of lower curvature. The derivation of the temporal evolution of the characteristic spacing $\\lambda(t)$ proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Driving Force (Gibbs-Thomson Effect):** The chemical potential $\\mu$ at a curved interface is higher than that at a flat interface ($\\mu_{\\infty}$). The shift, $\\Delta \\mu = \\mu - \\mu_{\\infty}$, is proportional to the mean curvature $\\kappa$. For a lamellar structure, the regions of highest curvature are the lamellar terminations or faults, and the curvature $\\kappa$ scales inversely with the lamellar spacing $\\lambda$, i.e., $\\kappa \\propto 1/\\lambda$. The Gibbs-Thomson relation gives this dependence as $\\Delta \\mu \\propto \\gamma \\Omega \\kappa$, where $\\gamma$ is the interfacial energy and $\\Omega$ is the molar volume. Thus, the chemical potential difference that drives diffusion scales as $\\Delta \\mu \\propto 1/\\lambda$.\n\n2.  **Concentration Gradient:** For a near-ideal solution at constant temperature, the chemical potential is related to the solute concentration $c$. A chemical potential difference $\\Delta \\mu$ thus creates a concentration difference $\\Delta c$, such that $\\Delta c \\propto \\Delta \\mu$. Therefore, the concentration difference between regions of different curvature scales as $\\Delta c \\propto 1/\\lambda$. The spatial concentration gradient, $\\nabla c$, over a characteristic diffusion distance, which is itself on the order of $\\lambda$, can be approximated as $|\\nabla c| \\approx \\Delta c / \\lambda$. Combining these proportionalities gives $|\\nabla c| \\propto (1/\\lambda)/\\lambda = 1/\\lambda^2$.\n\n3.  **Diffusive Flux (Fick's Law):** The diffusive flux of atoms, $J$, is proportional to the concentration gradient, as given by Fick's first law, $J = -D \\nabla c$, where $D$ is the effective diffusion coefficient. The magnitude of the flux is therefore $J \\propto D|\\nabla c| \\propto D/\\lambda^2$.\n\n4.  **Mass Conservation and Coarsening Rate:** The rate of growth of the characteristic spacing, $d\\lambda/dt$, is determined by the rate at which material is transported. This transport rate is proportional to the flux $J$. Therefore, $d\\lambda/dt \\propto J$.\n\n5.  **Differential Equation for Coarsening:** Combining the dependencies, we arrive at the governing differential equation for diffusion-controlled lamellar coarsening:\n    $$ \\frac{d\\lambda}{dt} \\propto \\frac{D \\gamma \\Omega}{RT} \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} $$\n    Let us group all the material and temperature-dependent constants into a single parameter $K'$, such that:\n    $$ \\frac{d\\lambda}{dt} = \\frac{K'}{\\lambda^2} $$\n    This equation can be solved by separation of variables.\n    $$ \\lambda^2 d\\lambda = K' dt $$\n    Integrating from the initial state $(\\lambda_0, t=0)$ to a state $(\\lambda(t), t)$:\n    $$ \\int_{\\lambda_0}^{\\lambda(t)} \\lambda'^2 d\\lambda' = \\int_0^t K' dt' $$\n    $$ \\frac{1}{3}\\lambda(t)^3 - \\frac{1}{3}\\lambda_0^3 = K't $$\n    $$ \\lambda(t)^3 - \\lambda_0^3 = 3K't $$\n    The problem provides an effective coarsening kinetics parameter $B = 3.5 \\times 10^{-24}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Comparing the units of $B$ with our derived equation, we identify $B = 3K'$. The coarsening law is thus:\n    $$ \\lambda(t)^3 - \\lambda_0^3 = Bt $$\n\nNow, we compute the time $t_{2\\times}$ required for the spacing to double, i.e., $\\lambda(t_{2\\times}) = 2\\lambda_0$.\n$$ (2\\lambda_0)^3 - \\lambda_0^3 = B t_{2\\times} $$\n$$ 8\\lambda_0^3 - \\lambda_0^3 = B t_{2\\times} $$\n$$ 7\\lambda_0^3 = B t_{2\\times} $$\n$$ t_{2\\times} = \\frac{7\\lambda_0^3}{B} $$\nThe given values are $\\lambda_0 = 250\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}$ and $B = 3.5 \\times 10^{-24}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.

The new spacing is:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\mathrm{new}} = 2 \\times (2.5 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}) = 5.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\nThe given parameters are the friction stress $\\sigma_0 = 480\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$ and the pile-up coefficient (or Hall-Petch slope) $k_{\\mathrm{HP}} = 0.55\\,\\mathrm{MPa}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{1/2}$.
