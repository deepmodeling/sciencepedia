            "solution": "The problem as stated is a standard exercise in the calculus of variations, specifically within the context of Ginzburg-Landau theory for interfaces. All premises are scientifically sound, and the problem is mathematically well-posed. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires finding a stationary profile $\\eta(x)$ that minimizes the free energy functional\n$$\nF[\\eta] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} L(\\eta, \\eta') \\, dx,\n$$\nwhere the Lagrangian is $L(\\eta, \\eta') = \\frac{\\kappa}{2} (\\eta')^{2} + f_{0}(\\eta)$, with $\\eta' \\equiv \\frac{d\\eta}{dx}$ and $f_{0}(\\eta) = \\frac{A}{4} (\\eta^{2} - 1)^{2}$. The parameters $\\kappa$ and $A$ are positive constants. The boundary conditions are $\\eta(x) \\to -1$ as $x \\to -\\infty$ and $\\eta(x) \\to +1$ as $x \\to +\\infty$.\n\nA stationary profile must satisfy the Euler-Lagrange equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\eta} - \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\eta'} \\right) = 0.\n$$\nThe partial derivatives of the Lagrangian are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\eta} = \\frac{df_{0}}{d\\eta} = \\frac{A}{4} \\cdot 2(\\eta^2 - 1) \\cdot (2\\eta) = A\\eta(\\eta^2 - 1).\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\eta'} = \\kappa \\eta'.\n$$\nSubstituting these into the Euler-Lagrange equation yields the governing ordinary differential equation for the stationary profile:\n$$\nA\\eta(\\eta^2 - 1) - \\kappa \\frac{d^2\\eta}{dx^2} = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\kappa \\frac{d^2\\eta}{dx^2} = \\frac{df_{0}}{d\\eta}.\n$$\nThis is the required governing ODE. To find its first integral, we observe that the Lagrangian $L(\\eta, \\eta')$ does not explicitly depend on the independent variable $x$. Therefore, the Beltrami identity holds, which states that the quantity $H = \\eta' \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\eta'} - L$ is a constant.\n$$\nH = \\eta'(\\kappa \\eta') - \\left[ \\frac{\\kappa}{2} (\\eta')^{2} + f_{0}(\\eta) \\right] = \\frac{\\kappa}{2} (\\eta')^{2} - f_{0}(\\eta) = \\text{const}.\n$$\nTo evaluate the constant, we apply the boundary conditions. As $x \\to \\pm\\infty$, the profile approaches one of the bulk equilibrium states, $\\eta \\to \\pm 1$. In these regions, the profile must be uniform, so $\\eta' \\to 0$. The bulk free energy density at these states is $f_{0}(\\pm 1) = \\frac{A}{4}((\\pm 1)^2 - 1)^2 = 0$.\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $H$, we find that the constant is $0$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\kappa}{2} (0)^{2} - 0 = 0.\n$$\nThus, the first integral of the motion for the energy-minimizing profile is\n$$\n\\frac{\\kappa}{2} \\left(\\frac{d\\eta}{dx}\\right)^{2} = f_{0}(\\eta).\n$$\nFrom this first integral, we can find the explicit form of the profile. We seek a monotone increasing solution ($\\frac{d\\eta}{dx} > 0$) connecting $\\eta = -1$ to $\\eta = +1$.\n$$\n\\frac{d\\eta}{dx} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2f_{0}(\\eta)}{\\kappa}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\kappa} \\frac{A}{4}(\\eta^2-1)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{A}{2\\kappa}} |\\eta^2-1|.\n$$\nSince $\\eta(x)$ varies between $-1$ and $+1$, the term $\\eta^2 - 1$ is non-positive, so $|\\eta^2 - 1| = 1 - \\eta^2$. The differential equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\eta}{dx} = \\sqrt{\\frac{A}{2\\kappa}} (1 - \\eta^2).\n$$\nThis equation is separable. We integrate it subject to the condition that the interface is centered at $x=0$, i.e., $\\eta(0)=0$.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\eta} \\frac{d\\tilde{\\eta}}{1 - \\tilde{\\eta}^2} = \\int_{0}^{x} \\sqrt{\\frac{A}{2\\kappa}} d\\tilde{x}\n$$\n$$\n[\\operatorname{arctanh}(\\tilde{\\eta})]_{0}^{\\eta} = \\left[\\sqrt{\\frac{A}{2\\kappa}}\\tilde{x}\\right]_{0}^{x}\n$$\n$$\n\\operatorname{arctanh}(\\eta) = \\sqrt{\\frac{A}{2\\kappa}} x.\n$$\nThe stationary profile is therefore given by:\n$$\n\\eta(x) = \\tanh\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{A}{2\\kappa}} x\\right).\n$$\nThis profile correctly satisfies the boundary conditions $\\eta \\to \\pm 1$ as $x \\to \\pm \\infty$. The characteristic interfacial width, $\\lambda$, is typically defined from the scaling of the argument, $\\eta(x) = \\tanh(x/\\lambda)$. By comparison, we identify the width as:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\kappa}{A}}.\n$$\nThe final step is to compute the interfacial free energy, $\\gamma$, defined as the value of the functional $F[\\eta]$ for this stationary profile:\n$$\n\\gamma = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\left[ \\frac{\\kappa}{2} \\left(\\frac{d\\eta}{dx}\\right)^{2} + f_{0}(\\eta) \\right] dx.\n$$\nUsing the first integral, $\\frac{\\kappa}{2}(\\eta')^2 = f_{0}(\\eta)$, we can simplify the integrand:\n$$\n\\gamma = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} 2 f_{0}(\\eta) \\, dx \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\gamma = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\kappa \\left(\\frac{d\\eta}{dx}\\right)^{2} dx.\n$$\nA more direct method for calculation is to use the first integral to write $\\frac{d\\eta}{dx}$ in terms of $\\eta$ and change the integration variable from $x$ to $\\eta$.\n$$\n\\gamma = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\kappa \\left(\\frac{d\\eta}{dx}\\right) \\frac{d\\eta}{dx} dx = \\int_{\\eta(-\\infty)}^{\\eta(+\\infty)} \\kappa \\left(\\frac{d\\eta}{dx}\\right) d\\eta.\n$$\nSubstituting $\\frac{d\\eta}{dx} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2f_0(\\eta)}{\\kappa}}$:\n$$\n\\gamma = \\int_{-1}^{+1} \\kappa \\sqrt{\\frac{2f_{0}(\\eta)}{\\kappa}} d\\eta = \\int_{-1}^{+1} \\sqrt{2\\kappa f_{0}(\\eta)} \\,d\\eta.\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $f_0(\\eta)$:\n$$\n\\gamma = \\int_{-1}^{+1} \\sqrt{2\\kappa \\cdot \\frac{A}{4}(\\eta^2-1)^2} \\, d\\eta = \\sqrt{\\frac{A\\kappa}{2}} \\int_{-1}^{+1} |\\eta^2-1| \\, d\\eta.\n$$\nAgain, since $\\eta \\in [-1, 1]$, we have $|\\eta^2 - 1| = 1 - \\eta^2$.\n$$\n\\gamma = \\sqrt{\\frac{A\\kappa}{2}} \\int_{-1}^{+1} (1-\\eta^2) \\, d\\eta.\n$$\nThe integral is elementary:\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{+1} (1-\\eta^2) \\, d\\eta = \\left[\\eta - \\frac{\\eta^3}{3}\\right]_{-1}^{+1} = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{3}\\right) - \\left(-1 - \\frac{-1}{3}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3} - \\left(-\\frac{2}{3}\\right) = \\frac{4}{3}.\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $\\gamma$:\n$$\n\\gamma = \\sqrt{\\frac{A\\kappa}{2}} \\cdot \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{4}{3\\sqrt{2}}\\sqrt{A\\kappa} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{3}\\sqrt{A\\kappa}.\n$$\nThis is the final expression for the interfacial energy in terms of the given parameters $A$ and $\\kappa$.",

            "solution": "The validity of the proposed statements rests upon the fundamental principle of conservation for a quantity $c(\\mathbf{x},t)$ within a domain $\\Omega$. The total amount, or mass, of this quantity is given by the integral $M(t) = \\int_{\\Omega} c(\\mathbf{x},t)\\,\\mathrm{d}V$. For the total mass to be conserved, its time derivative must be zero for all time $t \\ge 0$.\n\nLet us derive the condition for mass conservation from first principles. Taking the time derivative of $M(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{dM}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{\\Omega} c(\\mathbf{x},t)\\,\\mathrm{d}V $$\nUnder the assumption of sufficient smoothness of the field $c(\\mathbf{x},t)$, we may interchange the derivative and the integral:\n$$ \\frac{dM}{dt} = \\int_{\\Omega} \\frac{\\partial c(\\mathbf{x},t)}{\\partial t}\\,\\mathrm{d}V $$\nThe Cahn-Hilliard description is based on a continuity equation for the conserved variable $c$, which states that the local rate of change of $c$ is equal to the negative divergence of a flux $\\mathbf{J}(\\mathbf{x},t)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} $$\nIn the Cahn-Hilliard model, this flux is driven by the gradient of the chemical potential, $\\mu(\\mathbf{x},t)$, such that $\\mathbf{J} = -L \\nabla \\mu$, where $L$ is a positive-definite mobility parameter, here taken as a positive constant for simplicity.\n\nSubstituting the continuity equation into the expression for $\\frac{dM}{dt}$:\n$$ \\frac{dM}{dt} = \\int_{\\Omega} (-\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J})\\,\\mathrm{d}V $$\nBy applying the divergence theorem (Gauss's theorem), the volume integral of the divergence is converted to a surface integral of the flux over the boundary $\\partial \\Omega$:\n$$ \\frac{dM}{dt} = - \\oint_{\\partial \\Omega} \\mathbf{J} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}\\,\\mathrm{d}S $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{n}$ is the outward unit normal vector on the boundary $\\partial \\Omega$.\nTherefore, for mass to be conserved, i.e., $\\frac{dM}{dt}=0$, we must have zero net flux across the boundary:\n$$ \\oint_{\\partial \\Omega} \\mathbf{J} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}\\,\\mathrm{d}S = 0 $$\nSubstituting the constitutive relation for the flux, $\\mathbf{J}=-L\\nabla\\mu$, the condition becomes:\n$$ \\oint_{\\partial \\Omega} (-L \\nabla \\mu) \\cdot \\mathbf{n}\\,\\mathrm{d}S = -L \\oint_{\\partial \\Omega} (\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\nabla \\mu)\\,\\mathrm{d}S = 0 $$\nSince $L > 0$, this is equivalent to requiring that the integral of the normal derivative of the chemical potential over the boundary is zero:\n$$ \\oint_{\\partial \\Omega} (\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\nabla \\mu)\\,\\mathrm{d}S = 0 $$\nA sufficient, though not strictly necessary, condition is that the integrand itself is identically zero everywhere on the boundary, i.e., $\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\nabla \\mu = 0$ on $\\partial \\Omega$. This is the no-flux boundary condition. The Cahn-Hilliard equation, being fourth-order in $c(\\mathbf{x},t)$, requires two boundary conditions for a well-posed problem.\n\nWe now evaluate each statement based on this derived principle.\n\nA. Dirichlet for both fields: prescribe $c = c_{b}(\\mathbf{x},t)$ and $\\mu = \\mu_{b}(\\mathbf{x},t)$ on $\\partial \\Omega$.\nThis statement is incorrect. Prescribing the value of the chemical potential $\\mu = \\mu_{b}$ on the boundary does not, in general, constrain its normal derivative $\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\nabla \\mu$ to be zero or to have a zero integral over $\\partial \\Omega$. A non-uniform distribution of $\\mu_{b}$ on the boundary will typically induce a non-zero flux $\\mathbf{J} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} \\neq 0$. Therefore, mass is not guaranteed to be conserved. Furthermore, specifying both $c$ and $\\mu$ on the boundary over-constrains the problem, as $\\mu$ is related to $c$ and its spatial derivatives. Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nB. Homogeneous Neumann for both fields: impose $\\mathbf{n}\\cdot \\nabla c = 0$ and $\\mathbf{n}\\cdot \\nabla \\mu = 0$ on $\\partial \\Omega$.\nThis statement is correct. The condition $\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\nabla \\mu = 0$ is imposed on the entire boundary $\\partial \\Omega$. This means the integrand in the total flux integral, $\\mathbf{J} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = -L(\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\nabla \\mu)$, is identically zero at every point on the boundary. Consequently, the integral $\\oint_{\\partial \\Omega} \\mathbf{J} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}\\,\\mathrm{d}S$ is guaranteed to be zero, and total mass $M(t)$ is conserved. The additional condition $\\mathbf{n}\\cdot \\nabla c = 0$ makes the problem well-posed and corresponds to the natural boundary condition for an isolated system. Verdict: **Correct**.\n\nC. Periodic for both fields on opposite faces: at paired boundary points $\\mathbf{x}_{L}$ and $\\mathbf{x}_{R}$, require $c(\\mathbf{x}_{L},t) = c(\\mathbf{x}_{R},t)$, $\\mu(\\mathbf{x}_{L},t) = \\mu(\\mathbf{x}_{R},t)$, and matching normal derivatives.\nThis statement is correct. Periodic boundary conditions imply that the domain $\\Omega$ can be viewed as a unit cell in an infinite, repeating lattice. For any pair of opposite faces, say $\\Gamma_{L}$ and $\\Gamma_{R}$, the outward normal vectors are opposed, $\\mathbf{n}_{L} = -\\mathbf{n}_{R}$. The periodicity of the fields $c$ and $\\mu$ implies that their gradients, and thus the flux vector $\\mathbf{J}$, must also be periodic: $\\mathbf{J}(\\mathbf{x}_{L},t) = \\mathbf{J}(\\mathbf{x}_{R},t)$ for corresponding points $\\mathbf{x}_{L} \\in \\Gamma_{L}$ and $\\mathbf{x}_{R} \\in \\Gamma_{R}$. The total flux across this pair of faces is $\\int_{\\Gamma_{L}} \\mathbf{J} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_{L}\\,\\mathrm{d}S + \\int_{\\Gamma_{R}} \\mathbf{J} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_{R}\\,\\mathrm{d}S$. Using the periodicity relations, this becomes $\\int_{\\text{face}} \\mathbf{J} \\cdot (-\\mathbf{n}_{R})\\,\\mathrm{d}S + \\int_{\\text{face}} \\mathbf{J} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}_{R}\\,\\mathrm{d}S = 0$. Since the net flux is zero for every pair of opposing faces, the total flux integral over the entire boundary, $\\oint_{\\partial \\Omega} \\mathbf{J} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}\\,\\mathrm{d}S$, is zero. Mass is conserved. The wording regarding matching normal derivatives correctly reflects the consequence of field periodicity. Verdict: **Correct**.\n\nD. Homogeneous Neumann for $c$ only: impose $\\mathbf{n}\\cdot \\nabla c = 0$ on $\\partial \\Omega$ but leave $\\mu$ arbitrary on $\\partial \\Omega$.\nThis statement is incorrect. Mass conservation is governed by the flux, which depends on $\\nabla \\mu$, not $\\nabla c$. The condition $\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\nabla c = 0$ does not constrain the flux $\\mathbf{J} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}$. If the boundary condition on $\\mu$ is left \"arbitrary\", one can easily choose a condition (e.g., a non-constant Dirichlet condition) that leads to non-zero boundary flux and thus violates mass conservation. The statement is fundamentally flawed. Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. Dirichlet for $c$ and homogeneous Neumann for $\\mu$: prescribe $c = c_{b}(\\mathbf{x},t)$ on $\\partial \\Omega$ and impose $\\mathbf{n}\\cdot \\nabla \\mu = 0$ on $\\partial \\Omega$.\nThis statement is correct. The condition that guarantees mass conservation is the one on the flux. As in option B, the specific imposition of a homogeneous Neumann condition on the chemical potential, $\\mathbf{n}\\cdot \\nabla \\mu = 0$, ensures that the normal component of the flux $\\mathbf{J} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = -L(\\mathbf{n}\\cdot\\nabla\\mu)$ is zero everywhere on the boundary $\\partial \\Omega$. This directly forces the total flux integral $\\oint_{\\partial \\Omega} \\mathbf{J} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}\\,\\mathrm{d}S$ to be zero, thus guaranteeing mass conservation. The accompanying Dirichlet condition on $c$, $c=c_{b}(\\mathbf{x},t)$, simply serves as the second boundary condition required to pose the problem; it has no bearing on the mathematical guarantee of mass conservation provided by the no-flux condition on $\\mu$.

The variational derivative is found using the Euler-Lagrange equation:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{\\delta \\mathcal{F}}{\\delta c} = \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial c} - \\nabla \\cdot \\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial (\\nabla c)}.\n$$\nThe required partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial c} = \\frac{dF}{dc} = \\frac{d}{dc}\\left[\\frac{1}{4}(c^2-1)^2\\right] = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 2(c^2-1) \\cdot 2c = c^3 - c.\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial I}{\\partial (\\nabla c)} = \\kappa \\nabla c.\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\mu$ yields:\n$$\n\\mu = (c^3 - c) - \\kappa \\nabla^2 c.\n$$\nInserting this into the Cahn-Hilliard equation gives the full fourth-order nonlinear partial differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = M \\nabla^2 (c^3 - c - \\kappa \\nabla^2 c) = M \\left( \\nabla^2(c^3 - c) - \\kappa \\nabla^4 c \\right).\n$$\n\nFor the numerical solution, we employ a Fourier pseudo-spectral method for spatial discretization and a semi-implicit first-order scheme for time integration. The spatial domain $[0, L]$ is discretized into $N$ grid points $x_j = j \\Delta x$ with grid spacing $\\Delta x = L/N$. The phase field $c(x,t)$ is represented by its values $c_j(t)$ on this grid. In the Fourier spectral method, spatial derivatives are computed in Fourier space. A function $f(x)$ is transformed to its Fourier coefficients $\\hat{f}(k)$, where $k$ are the wavenumbers. The $n$-th derivative in Fourier space corresponds to multiplication by $(ik)^n$. Thus, $\\nabla^2$ becomes multiplication by $-k^2$ and $\\nabla^4$ becomes multiplication by $k^4$.\n\nThe problem requires a semi-implicit time-stepping scheme where the nonlinear bulk term's contribution, which comes from $F'(c) = c^3-c$, is treated explicitly, and the stiff gradient energy term, $-\\kappa\\nabla^2 c$, is treated implicitly. Using a first-order forward Euler for the explicit part and backward Euler for the implicit part, the time-discretized equation for a time step $\\Delta t$ from step $n$ to $n+1$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{c^{n+1} - c^n}{\\Delta t} = M \\nabla^2 \\left[ ( (c^n)^3 - c^n ) - \\kappa \\nabla^2 c^{n+1} \\right].\n$$\nThis equation is algebraic in Fourier space, which makes it easy to solve for $\\hat{c}^{n+1}$. Let $\\hat{c}^n(k)$ be the discrete Fourier transform of $c^n(x_j)$. Transforming the equation, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{\\hat{c}^{n+1} - \\hat{c}^n}{\\Delta t} = M (-k^2) \\left[ \\widehat{((c^n)^3 - c^n)} + \\kappa k^2 \\hat{c}^{n+1} \\right].\n$$\nThe term $\\widehat{((c^n)^3 - c^n)}$ is computed pseudo-spectrally: the expression $(c^n)^3 - c^n$ is evaluated in real space at each grid point, and the result is then transformed to Fourier space.\nWe rearrange the equation to solve for $\\hat{c}^{n+1}(k)$:\n$$\n\\hat{c}^{n+1} - \\hat{c}^n = -M k^2 \\Delta t \\, \\widehat{((c^n)^3 - c^n)} - M \\kappa k^4 \\Delta t \\, \\hat{c}^{n+1}\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{c}^{n+1}(1 + M \\kappa k^4 \\Delta t) = \\hat{c}^n - M k^2 \\Delta t \\, \\widehat{((c^n)^3 - c^n)}\n$$\nThis yields the update rule for the Fourier coefficients at each time step:\n$$\n\\hat{c}^{n+1}(k) = \\frac{\\hat{c}^n(k) - M k^2 \\Delta t \\, \\widehat{((c^n)^3 - c^n)}(k)}{1 + M \\kappa k^4 \\Delta t}.\n$$\nAt each time step, we start with $c^n$, compute its Fourier transform $\\hat{c}^n$, compute the nonlinear term and its transform, apply the update rule to find $\\hat{c}^{n+1}$, and then perform an inverse Fourier transform to obtain $c^{n+1}$.\n\nThe discrete free energy $\\mathcal{F}_h$ is calculated at each step using the trapezoidal rule on the grid:\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}_h[c] = \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \\left[ \\frac{1}{4}(c_j^2-1)^2 + \\frac{\\kappa}{2} (\\partial_x c|_j)^2 \\right] \\Delta x.\n$$\nThe spatial derivative $\\partial_x c$ is computed spectrally by taking the Fourier transform of $c$, multiplying the coefficients $\\hat{c}(k)$ by $ik$, and then taking the inverse Fourier transform.\n\nWe must verify if the energy sequence $\\{\\mathcal{F}_h^n\\}$ is monotonically non-increasing. Numerical computation with finite-precision arithmetic introduces roundoff errors. A check for strict inequality $\\mathcal{F}_h^{n+1} \\le \\mathcal{F}_h^{n}$ is therefore inappropriate. An energy increase is considered significant only if it exceeds a tolerance. A robust tolerance must account for both the absolute magnitude of potential roundoff errors in near-zero energies and the relative error when energy is large. We define the tolerance $\\epsilon_{tol}$ as a sum of an absolute component $\\tau_{abs}$ and a relative component $\\tau_{rel} \\cdot |\\mathcal{F}_h^n|$. The condition for a non-monotonic step is then $\\mathcal{F}_h^{n+1} - \\mathcal{F}_h^n > \\tau_{abs} + \\tau_{rel} |\\mathcal{F}_h^n|$. For the double-precision floating-point numbers used, we choose conservative values $\\tau_{abs} = 10^{-12}$ and $\\tau_{rel} = 10^{-10}$. An energy sequence is deemed non-monotonic if this condition is met for any time step $n$.",
