The derivation will proceed directly from the fundamental definitions provided for the two-sublattice model $(A,B,C)_3(A,B,C)_1$.\n\nThe model specifies two sublattices with multiplicities $a_1=3$ and $a_2=1$.\nAccording to the first provided definition, the total number of lattice sites per formula unit, let's call it $N$, is the sum of the sublattice multiplicities:\n$$N = a_1 + a_2 = 3 + 1 = 4$$\n\nAlso from the first definition, the number of atoms of a specific constituent $i$ per formula unit, let's call it $n_i$, is the sum of its contributions from each sublattice.

The number of $A$ atoms is $N_A^{(1)} = N y_A^{(1)}$ and the number of $B$ atoms is $N_B^{(1)} = N y_B^{(1)}$.

The number of moles of formula units is $n = N/N_{A}$, where $N_A$ is the Avogadro constant.\n$$\nS_m = \\frac{S}{n} = \\frac{S N_A}{N} \\approx -N_A k_B \\left[ (y_A^{(1)} \\ln y_A^{(1)} + y_B^{(1)} \\ln y_B^{(1)}) + (y_A^{(2)} \\ln y_A^{(2)} + y_B^{(2)} \\ln y_B^{(2)}) \\right]\n$$\nUsing the definition of the molar gas constant, $R = N_A k_B$, we obtain the molar entropy:\n$$\nS_m = -R \\left[ (y_A^{(1)} \\ln y_A^{(1)} + y_B^{(1)} \\ln y_B^{(1)}) + (y_A^{(2)} \\ln y_A^{(2)} + y_B^{(2)} \\ln y_B^{(2)}) \\right]\n$$\nThe problem asks for the dimensionless entropy $S/R$, which we identify with $S_m/R$:\n$$\n\\frac{S_m}{R} = -(y_A^{(1)} \\ln y_A^{(1)} + y_B^{(1)} \\ln y_B^{(1)} + y_A^{(2)} \\ln y_A^{(2)} + y_B^{(2)} \\ln y_B^{(2)})\n$$\nThis is the first part of the required answer.\n\nNext, we find the extrema of this entropy for an equiatomic composition, $x_A=x_B=\\frac{1}{2}$. The overall mole fraction of component $A$ is related to the site fractions by $x_A = \\frac{a^{(1)}y_A^{(1)} + a^{(2)}y_A^{(2)}}{a^{(1)}+a^{(2)}}$. With $a^{(1)}=a^{(2)}=1$, we have $x_A = \\frac{y_A^{(1)}+y_A^{(2)}}{2}$. For $x_A=\\frac{1}{2}$, this implies the constraint $y_A^{(1)}+y_A^{(2)}=1$.\nCombined with the sublattice constraints $y_A^{(1)}+y_B^{(1)}=1$ and $y_A^{(2)}+y_B^{(2)}=1$, we can express all site fractions in terms of a single variable, let $y = y_A^{(1)}$.\n$y_B^{(1)} = 1 - y_A^{(1)} = 1-y$\n$y_A^{(2)} = 1 - y_A^{(1)} = 1-y$\n$y_B^{(2)} = 1 - y_A^{(2)} = 1 - (1-y) = y$\nThe site fractions are $(y_A^{(1)}, y_B^{(1)}) = (y, 1-y)$ and $(y_A^{(2)}, y_B^{(2)}) = (1-y, y)$. The variable $y$ ranges from $0$ to $1$.\nSubstituting these into the entropy expression:\n$$\n\\frac{S_m(y)}{R} = -[y \\ln y + (1-y)\\ln(1-y) + (1-y)\\ln(1-y) + y\\ln y]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{S_m(y)}{R} = -2[y \\ln y + (1-y)\\ln(1-y)]\n$$\nTo find the extrema, we differentiate with respect to $y$ and set the result to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dy}\\left(\\frac{S_m}{R}\\right) = -2 \\frac{d}{dy}[y \\ln y + (1-y)\\ln(1-y)] = -2[(\\ln y + 1) + (-\\ln(1-y)-1)] = -2\\ln\\left(\\frac{y}{1-y}\\right)\n$$\nSetting the derivative to zero: $-2\\ln\\left(\\frac{y}{1-y}\\right) = 0 \\implies \\frac{y}{1-y}=1 \\implies y=\\frac{1}{2}$.\nTo classify this extremum, we examine the second derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2}{dy^2}\\left(\\frac{S_m}{R}\\right) = \\frac{d}{dy}\\left[-2\\ln\\left(\\frac{y}{1-y}\\right)\\right] = -2\\left(\\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{1-y}\\right) = \\frac{-2}{y(1-y)}\n$$\nFor $y \\in (0,1)$, the second derivative is always negative, indicating that the function is concave. Thus, $y=\\frac{1}{2}$ corresponds to a global maximum.\nThe maximum value of the molar configurational entropy is:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{S_m}{R}\\right)_{\\text{max}} = -2\\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\left(1-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\ln\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right] = -2\\left[\\frac{1}{2}(-\\ln 2) + \\frac{1}{2}(-\\ln 2)\\right] = -2(-\\ln 2) = 2\\ln 2\n$$\nThis maximum occurs for the configuration $y_A^{(1)}=y_A^{(2)}=y_B^{(1)}=y_B^{(2)}=\\frac{1}{2}$, which represents a completely disordered state where both sublattices are randomly occupied.\n\nThe minimum value must occur at the boundaries of the domain $y \\in [0,1]$. We evaluate the function at $y=0$ and $y=1$. Using the fact that $\\lim_{x\\to 0^+} x\\ln x = 0$:\n$$\n\\lim_{y\\to 0^+} \\frac{S_m(y)}{R} = -2[\\lim_{y\\to 0^+}(y\\ln y) + (1-0)\\ln(1-0)] = -2[0+0] = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\lim_{y\\to 1^-} \\frac{S_m(y)}{R} = -2[(1)\\ln(1) + \\lim_{y\\to 1^-}((1-y)\\ln(1-y))] = -2[0+0] = 0\n$$\nThe minimum value of the molar configurational entropy is $0$. This occurs for two configurations:\n1. $y=0$: $y_A^{(1)}=0, y_B^{(1)}=1, y_A^{(2)}=1, y_B^{(2)}=0$.

The general formula is:\n$$G_{\\text{ideal}} = R T \\sum_{s} v^{(s)} \\sum_{i} y_{i}^{(s)} \\ln(y_{i}^{(s)})$$\nHere, the site ratios are $v^{(1)} = 1$ and $v^{(2)} = 1$, and the gas constant is $R = 8.314$ $\\text{J mol}^{-1} \\text{K}^{-1}$.\n$$G_{\\text{ideal}} = R T \\left[ v^{(1)} \\left( y_{\\text{Ni}}^{(1)}\\ln(y_{\\text{Ni}}^{(1)}) + y_{\\text{Co}}^{(1)}\\ln(y_{\\text{Co}}^{(1)}) \\right) + v^{(2)} \\left( y_{\\text{Al}}^{(2)}\\ln(y_{\\text{Al}}^{(2)}) + y_{\\text{Ti}}^{(2)}\\ln(y_{\\text{Ti}}^{(2)}) \\right) \\right]$$\n$$G_{\\text{ideal}} = (8.314)(1200) \\left[ (1) \\left( 0.6\\ln(0.6) + 0.4\\ln(0.4) \\right) + (1) \\left( 0.7\\ln(0.7) + 0.3\\ln(0.3) \\right) \\right]$$\n$$G_{\\text{ideal}} \\approx (9976.8) \\left[ (0.6(-0.51083) + 0.4(-0.91629)) + (0.7(-0.35667) + 0.3(-1.20397)) \\right]$$\n$$G_{\\text{ideal}} \\approx (9976.8) \\left[ (-0.30650 - 0.36652) + (-0.24967 - 0.36119) \\right]$$\n$$G_{\\text{ideal}} \\approx (9976.8) \\left[ -0.67302 - 0.61086 \\right]$$\n$$G_{\\text{ideal}} \\approx (9976.8) [-1.28388]$$\n$$G_{\\text{ideal}} \\approx -12807.5 \\text{ J mol}^{-1}$$\nThis is the ideal contribution to the Gibbs energy.\n\n3.  The Excess Gibbs Energy ($G_{\\text{excess}}$)\nThe excess Gibbs energy accounts for non-ideal interactions between elements on the same sublattice. For the given zeroth-order Redlich-Kister polynomials, the formula is:\n$$G_{\\text{excess}} = v^{(1)} y_{\\text{Ni}}^{(1)}y_{\\text{Co}}^{(1)}L_{\\text{Ni,Co}}^{(1,0)} + v^{(2)} y_{\\text{Al}}^{(2)}y_{\\text{Ti}}^{(2)}L_{\\text{Al,Ti}}^{(2,0)}$$\nSubstituting the site fractions, site ratios, and evaluated interaction parameters:\n$$G_{\\text{excess}} = (1)(0.6)(0.4)(800) + (1)(0.7)(0.3)(5600)$$\n$$G_{\\text{excess}} = (0.24)(800) + (0.21)(5600)$$\n$$G_{\\text{excess}} = 192 + 1176$$\n$$G_{\\text{excess}} = 1368 \\text{ J mol}^{-1}$$\nThis is the excess contribution to the Gibbs energy.\n\n4.  Total Molar Gibbs Energy ($G_m$)\nThe total molar Gibbs energy is the sum of the three calculated components. This serves as the verification step requested in the problem statement.\n$$G_m = G_{\\text{ref}} + G_{\\text{ideal}} + G_{\\text{excess}}$$\n$$G_m = -44040 \\text{ J mol}^{-1} + (-12807.5 \\text{ J mol}^{-1}) + 1368 \\text{ J mol}^{-1}$$\n$$G_m = -56847.5 + 1368$$\n$$G_m = -55479.5 \\text{ J mol}^{-1}$$\n\nFinally, we convert the result to $\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$ and round to $4$ significant figures, as required.\n$$G_m = -55.4795 \\text{ kJ mol}^{-1}$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures gives:\n$$G_m \\approx -55.48 \\text{ kJ mol}^{-1}$$",
