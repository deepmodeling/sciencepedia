The bridge is excited at a constant voltage of $5\\,\\mathrm{V}$. The transducer sensitivity is specified as $2\\,\\mathrm{mV}/\\mathrm{V}$ at full mechanical load, meaning that at full load the differential bridge output is a fraction of the excitation given by its sensitivity. The bridge output is amplified by a precision instrumentation amplifier of gain $G$ and then digitized by a bipolar differential Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). The ADC has a symmetric full-scale magnitude of $V_{\\mathrm{FS}}=2.5\\,\\mathrm{V}$, so that any differential input with magnitude exceeding $V_{\\mathrm{FS}}$ clips.\n\nTo ensure robust operation of the cyber-physical system and its Digital Twin under transients and drifts, the design requirement is that the amplified full-load signal magnitude equals $0.90$ of the ADC full-scale magnitude, thereby providing a symmetric margin of $\\pm 0.10$ of full-scale before clipping.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution is derived by following the signal path from the transducer to the ADC.\n\nFirst, we calculate the differential output voltage from the strain gauge bridge at full mechanical load, denoted as $V_{\\text{bridge,FL}}$. The sensitivity $S$ is defined as the ratio of the output voltage to the excitation voltage.\n$$\nS = \\frac{V_{\\text{bridge,FL}}}{V_{\\text{ex}}}\n$$\nTherefore, the bridge output at full load is:\n$$\nV_{\\text{bridge,FL}} = S \\times V_{\\text{ex}}\n$$\nThe given sensitivity is $S = 2\\,\\mathrm{mV}/\\mathrm{V}$, which is equivalent to $S = 2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}/\\mathrm{V}$. The excitation voltage is $V_{\\text{ex}} = 5\\,\\mathrm{V}$. Substituting these values:\n$$\nV_{\\text{bridge,FL}} = (2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V}/\\mathrm{V}) \\times 5\\,\\mathrm{V} = 10 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V} = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\nSince the bridge is perfectly balanced at no load, this value represents the full-scale differential signal from the transducer.\n\nNext, we determine the target magnitude for the amplified signal at the input of the ADC. The design requirement states that the amplified full-load signal magnitude, let's call it $|V_{\\text{amp,FL}}|$, must equal $0.90$ of the ADC's full-scale magnitude, $V_{\\mathrm{FS}}$.\n$$\n|V_{\\text{amp,FL}}| = 0.90 \\times V_{\\mathrm{FS}}\n$$\nThe ADC full-scale magnitude is given as $V_{\\mathrm{FS}} = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n$$\n|V_{\\text{amp,FL}}| = 0.90 \\times 2.5\\,\\mathrm{V} = 2.25\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\nThis setup ensures that the signal utilizes $90\\%$ of the ADC's dynamic range, leaving a margin for overshoots or drifts.\n\nNow, we can calculate the required gain $G$ of the instrumentation amplifier. The gain is the ratio of the amplifier's output voltage magnitude to its input voltage magnitude. The input to the amplifier is the bridge output, $V_{\\text{bridge,FL}}$.\n$$\nG = \\frac{|V_{\\text{amp,FL}}|}{|V_{\\text{bridge,FL}}|}\n$$\nUsing the values calculated above:\n$$\nG = \\frac{2.25\\,\\mathrm{V}}{0.01\\,\\mathrm{V}} = 225\n$$\nThe gain $G$ is a dimensionless quantity.\n\nFinally, we calculate the headroom $H$. The problem defines headroom as the remaining voltage magnitude between the ADC's full-scale limit $V_{\\mathrm{FS}}$ and the amplified full-load signal magnitude $|V_{\\text{amp,FL}}|$.\n$$\nH = V_{\\mathrm{FS}} - |V_{\\text{amp,FL}}|\n$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$\nH = 2.5\\,\\mathrm{V} - 2.25\\,\\mathrm{V} = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\nThis result is consistent with the problem's mention of a \"symmetric margin of $\\pm 0.10$ of full-scale,\" as $0.10 \\times V_{\\text{FS}} = 0.10 \\times 2.5\\,\\mathrm{V} = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n\nThe two required quantities are the gain $G = 225$ and the headroom $H = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{V}$.",

It is a standard and well-defined problem in the domain of signal conditioning for data conversion. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem is solved by following two main steps as requested by the tasks.\n\n**1. Derivation of the aliased baseband amplitude**\n\nAn interferer signal, which is a sinusoid at frequency $f_i$, is present at the input of the anti-alias filter. Its peak amplitude is given as $A_i$. The signal can be represented as $v_{in}(t) = A_i \\cos(2\\pi f_i t + \\phi)$, where $\\phi$ is an arbitrary phase.\n\nThis signal passes through the anti-alias filter, which has a magnitude response of $|H_a(f)|$. At the specific frequency of the interferer, $f_i$, the filter's gain is $|H_a(f_i)|$. The peak amplitude of the signal at the filter's output, which is also the input to the ADC, is the original peak amplitude multiplied by the filter's gain at that frequency. Let this filtered peak amplitude be $A_{i,filt}$.\n$$A_{i,filt} = A_i |H_a(f_i)|$$\nThe problem states to assume ideal sampling, which implies that the peak amplitude of the continuous-time signal being sampled is preserved in the resulting discrete-time sequence. A continuous-time sinusoid of peak amplitude $A_{peak}$ becomes a discrete-time sinusoid of the same peak amplitude $A_{peak}$. Therefore, the peak amplitude of the aliased spur, $A_{alias}$, in the digitized baseband is equal to the peak amplitude of the signal at the ADC's input.\n$$A_{alias} = A_{i,filt}$$\nCombining these two equations gives the aliased baseband peak amplitude as a function of $A_i$ and $|H_a(f_i)|$.\n$$A_{alias} = A_i |H_a(f_i)|$$\n\n**2. Determination of the minimum required stopband attenuation**\n\nThe system requirement is that the amplitude of any aliased spur must not exceed a fraction $\\epsilon$ of the ADC's full-scale peak amplitude, $A_{FS}$. This can be expressed as an inequality:\n$$A_{alias} \\le \\epsilon A_{FS}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $A_{alias}$ from the first part:\n$$A_i |H_a(f_i)| \\le \\epsilon A_{FS}$$\nTo meet this requirement, the gain of the filter at the interferer's frequency, $|H_a(f_i)|$, must be limited. We can solve for the maximum permissible gain:\n$$|H_a(f_i)| \\le \\frac{\\epsilon A_{FS}}{A_i}$$\nThe stopband attenuation of a filter, let's call it $L_a$, is the reciprocal of its gain.\n$$L_a(f) = \\frac{1}{|H_a(f)|}$$\nTherefore, the minimum required attenuation, $L_{a,min}$, at frequency $f_i$ corresponds to the maximum allowed gain $|H_a(f_i)|$.\n$$L_{a,min}(f_i) = \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon A_{FS}}{A_i}\\right)} = \\frac{A_i}{\\epsilon A_{FS}}$$\nThe problem requires this attenuation to be expressed in decibels ($\\mathrm{dB}$). The attenuation in decibels is defined as:\n$$L_{a,min}(\\mathrm{dB}) = 20 \\log_{10}(L_{a,min}(f_i)) = 20 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{A_i}{\\epsilon A_{FS}}\\right)$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values provided in the problem:\n$A_i = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n$A_{FS} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n$\\epsilon = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}$\n\n$$L_{a,min}(\\mathrm{dB}) = 20 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{0.8}{ (1.0 \\times 10^{-3}) \\cdot (1.0) }\\right)$$\n$$L_{a,min}(\\mathrm{dB}) = 20 \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{0.8}{10^{-3}}\\right)$$\n$$L_{a,min}(\\mathrm{dB}) = 20 \\log_{10}(800)$$\nCalculating the value:\n$$L_{a,min}(\\mathrm{dB}) = 20 \\times 2.90308998699...$$\n$$L_{a,min}(\\mathrm{dB}) \\approx 58.0617997...\\,\\mathrm{dB}$$\nThe final answer must be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$L_{a,min}(\\mathrm{dB}) \\approx 58.06\\,\\mathrm{dB}$$\nFor completeness, we can check the aliased frequency $f_a = |f_i - kf_s| = |280\\,\\mathrm{kHz} - k \\cdot 96\\,\\mathrm{kHz}|$ must fall in the baseband $[0, f_s/2] = [0, 48\\,\\mathrm{kHz}]$.

The derivation is a standard mathematical exercise.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation from First Principles**\n\nThe problem asks for the improvement in Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) due to oversampling. This improvement arises from spreading the fixed total quantization noise power over a wider frequency band and then filtering out the noise that falls outside the signal's band.\n\n1.  **Quantization Noise Power Spectral Density (PSD)**\n    The total power of the quantization noise is given by its variance, $P_q = \\sigma_e^2 = \\frac{\\Delta^2}{12}$.\n    This power is assumed to be uniformly distributed over the Nyquist frequency range, which is $[0, f_s/2]$. The one-sided Power Spectral Density, $N_q(f)$, is therefore constant over this range.\n    $$N_q(f) = \\frac{\\text{Total Power}}{\\text{Bandwidth}} = \\frac{P_q}{f_s/2} = \\frac{\\Delta^2/12}{f_s/2} = \\frac{\\Delta^2}{6f_s}, \\quad \\text{for } f \\in [0, f_s/2]$$\n\n2.  **In-Band Quantization Noise Power**\n    The system employs an ideal low-pass filter that passes frequencies in the range $[0, B]$. The noise power that remains after this filtering, known as the in-band noise power $P_{q, \\text{in-band}}$, is the integral of the noise PSD over this band.\n    $$P_{q, \\text{in-band}} = \\int_0^B N_q(f) \\, df$$\n    Since $N_q(f)$ is constant over this interval (as $B \\le f_s/2$ for oversampling), the integral simplifies to:\n    $$P_{q, \\text{in-band}} = N_q \\cdot B = \\left(\\frac{\\Delta^2}{6f_s}\\right) B = \\frac{\\Delta^2 B}{6f_s}$$\n\n3.  **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**\n    Let the power of the signal be $P_s$. We assume the signal is entirely within the passband $[0, B]$ and is unaffected by the ideal filter. The in-band SNR is the ratio of the signal power to the in-band noise power.\n    $$\\mathrm{SNR} = \\frac{P_s}{P_{q, \\text{in-band}}} = \\frac{P_s}{\\frac{\\Delta^2 B}{6f_s}} = P_s \\frac{6f_s}{\\Delta^2 B}$$\n\n4.  **Expressing SNR in terms of OSR**\n    The Oversampling Ratio (OSR) is given as $\\mathrm{OSR} = \\frac{f_s}{2B}$. We can rearrange this to express the sampling frequency as $f_s = 2B \\cdot \\mathrm{OSR}$. Substituting this into the SNR expression:\n    $$\\mathrm{SNR} = P_s \\frac{6 (2B \\cdot \\mathrm{OSR})}{\\Delta^2 B} = P_s \\frac{12 B \\cdot \\mathrm{OSR}}{\\Delta^2 B} = \\left(\\frac{12 P_s}{\\Delta^2}\\right) \\mathrm{OSR}$$\n\n5.  **SNR Improvement**\n    To quantify the improvement, we compare this SNR to a baseline case. The baseline is sampling at the Nyquist rate, $f_{s, \\text{Nyquist}} = 2B$. At this rate, $\\mathrm{OSR} = 1$. The baseline SNR, $\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{Nyquist}}$, is obtained by setting $\\mathrm{OSR}=1$ in our derived expression:\n    $$\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{Nyquist}} = \\left(\\frac{12 P_s}{\\Delta^2}\\right) \\cdot 1 = \\frac{12 P_s}{\\Delta^2}$$\n    The improvement is the ratio of the SNR achieved with oversampling to the baseline Nyquist-rate SNR.\n    $$\\text{Improvement Ratio} = \\frac{\\mathrm{SNR}}{\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{Nyquist}}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{12 P_s}{\\Delta^2}\\right) \\mathrm{OSR}}{\\frac{12 P_s}{\\Delta^2}} = \\mathrm{OSR}$$\n\n6.  **SNR Improvement in Decibels**\n    The problem asks for the improvement in decibels (dB). This is calculated as $10$ times the base-$10$ logarithm of the power improvement ratio.\n    $$\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{impr, dB}} = 10 \\log_{10}(\\text{Improvement Ratio}) = 10 \\log_{10}(\\mathrm{OSR})$$\n    This is the analytical expression for the SNR improvement. Each doubling of the OSR (and thus the sampling frequency) results in a $10 \\log_{10}(2) \\approx 3.01$ dB improvement in SNR.\n\n7.  **OSR for a 12 dB Improvement**\n    We are asked to find the OSR that yields an SNR improvement of $12$ dB. We set $\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\text{impr, dB}} = 12$:\n    $$12 = 10 \\log_{10}(\\mathrm{OSR})$$\n    Solving for $\\mathrm{OSR}$:\n    $$\\log_{10}(\\mathrm{OSR}) = \\frac{12}{10} = 1.2$$\n    $$\\mathrm{OSR} = 10^{1.2}$$\n    This is the exact expression for the required oversampling ratio.",
