This first exercise challenges you to do just that for a simple two-mode system. By solving the ordinary differential equation governing the initial mode and checking the state against the guard condition, you will gain direct experience with the core mechanics of a hybrid automaton's execution . This practice also reveals an important subtlety: a system's state may approach a guard boundary without ever reaching it in finite time.",

            "problem": "A cyber-physical process is modeled as a two-mode deterministic hybrid automaton that serves as a minimal Digital Twin representation of a threshold-driven controller. The state is a scalar $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and the discrete mode $q \\in \\{1,2\\}$. The continuous-time evolution in each mode is governed by ordinary differential equations: in mode $1$, $\\dot{x} = f_{1}(x)$ with $f_{1}(x) = -x$; in mode $2$, $\\dot{x} = f_{2}(x)$ with $f_{2}(x) = 2 - x$. The guard set for the transition from mode $1$ to mode $2$ is $G_{1 \\to 2} = \\{ x \\mid x \\le 0 \\}$, and the guard set for the transition from mode $2$ to mode $1$ is $G_{2 \\to 1} = \\{ x \\mid x \\ge 1 \\}$. Upon any discrete transition, an identity reset is applied: $x^{+} = x$. The initial condition is $x(0) = 0.5$ in mode $q(0) = 1$. Assume standard hybrid automaton semantics: the continuous trajectory in a mode follows the integral curve of the corresponding vector field until the state reaches the guard set for an outgoing transition; when the state is in a guard, a discrete switch occurs instantaneously with the given reset; the time of a discrete switch is the smallest time $t$ at which the state is in the guard of the current mode.\n\nUsing fundamental definitions of ordinary differential equations and hybrid automata, compute the continuous evolution $x(t)$ for mode $1$ starting from $x(0)=0.5$, determine whether and when the state enters $G_{1 \\to 2}$, and thereby determine the sequence of switching times. If there is no finite switching time, represent the first switching time symbolically as $+\\infty$. Express any reported switching times in seconds. The final answer must be a single real number or a single closed-form analytic expression.",
            "solution": "The problem describes a deterministic hybrid automaton with state $(q, x)$, where $q \\in \\{1, 2\\}$ is the discrete mode and $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is the continuous state. The initial condition is given as $q(0) = 1$ and $x(0) = 0.5$.\n\nWe begin by analyzing the evolution of the system within its initial mode, $q(0) = 1$. The continuous dynamics in this mode are governed by the ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$\n\\dot{x} = f_{1}(x) = -x\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear homogeneous ODE with constant coefficients. We can solve it by separation of variables or by using the standard form for its solution. Its general solution is:\n$$\nx(t) = C \\exp(-t)\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of integration. We determine the value of $C$ using the initial condition $x(0) = 0.5$.\n$$\nx(0) = C \\exp(-0) = C \\cdot 1 = C\n$$\nThus, we find that $C = 0.5$. The specific solution for the trajectory of the continuous state, starting from $x(0) = 0.5$ in mode $1$, is:\n$$\nx(t) = 0.5 \\exp(-t)\n$$\nThis solution describes the continuous evolution of $x$ for as long as the system remains in mode $1$.\n\nAccording to the hybrid automaton semantics, the system will switch from mode $1$ to mode $2$ at the smallest time $t \\ge 0$ for which the state $x(t)$ enters the guard set $G_{1 \\to 2}$. The guard set is defined as:\n$$\nG_{1 \\to 2} = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid x \\le 0 \\}\n$$\nTo find the first switching time, we must find the smallest non-negative time $t$ that satisfies the condition $x(t) \\le 0$. Substituting the expression for $x(t)$:\n$$\n0.5 \\exp(-t) \\le 0\n$$\nThe exponential function, $\\exp(y)$, is strictly positive for any real argument $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$. In our case, the argument is $-t$. Therefore, $\\exp(-t) > 0$ for all finite values of $t$. Since we are multiplying by a positive constant, $0.5$, the state $x(t)$ remains strictly positive for all finite $t \\ge 0$.\n$$\nx(t) = 0.5 \\exp(-t) > 0 \\quad \\forall t \\in [0, \\infty)\n$$\nThe condition $x(t) \\le 0$ is never met for any finite time $t$. The system remains in mode $1$ indefinitely.\n\nWe can further analyze the long-term behavior of the state by taking the limit as $t$ approaches infinity:\n$$\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} x(t) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} 0.5 \\exp(-t) = 0\n$$\nThis shows that the state $x(t)$ asymptotically approaches the value $0$, which lies on the boundary of the guard set $G_{1 \\to 2}$. However, the state never reaches or crosses this boundary in finite time.\n\nSince no discrete transition occurs at any finite time, there is no finite switching time. The problem statement explicitly provides instructions for this case: \"If there is no finite switching time, represent the first switching time symbolically as $+\\infty$.\" Therefore, the first switching time is infinity. The problem asks for the time in seconds; however, for an infinite time, units are conceptually symbolic.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the total time until Zeno behavior occurs in a bouncing-ball hybrid system. Zeno behavior, in this context, corresponds to an infinite number of impacts occurring in a finite time interval. This total time, denoted as $T_{\\mathrm{Zeno}}$, is the sum of the durations of all flight intervals between impacts.\n\nThe continuous dynamics of the ball are governed by the equations of motion for an object in a uniform gravitational field. The vertical velocity $v(t)$ and height $h(t)$ are given by integrating $\\dot{v}(t) = -g$ and $\\dot{h}(t) = v(t)$.\nIntegrating the acceleration equation gives the velocity:\n$$v(t) = v(t_i) - g(t - t_i)$$\nIntegrating the velocity equation gives the height:\n$$h(t) = h(t_i) + v(t_i)(t - t_i) - \\frac{1}{2}g(t - t_i)^2$$\nwhere $h(t_i)$ and $v(t_i)$ are the height and velocity at the beginning of a continuous time interval.\n\nWe will calculate the duration of each flight segment, $\\Delta t_k$, and then sum them to find $T_{\\mathrm{Zeno}}$.\n\n**Step 1: Duration of the first fall, $\\Delta t_0$**\nThe first segment of motion starts at $t=0$ with initial conditions $h(0) = h_0$ and $v(0) = 0$. The ball falls until it hits the ground at $h=0$. Let this first impact occur at time $t = \\Delta t_0$.\nUsing the equation for height:\n$$h(\\Delta t_0) = h(0) + v(0)\\Delta t_0 - \\frac{1}{2}g(\\Delta t_0)^2$$\n$$0 = h_0 + (0)\\Delta t_0 - \\frac{1}{2}g(\\Delta t_0)^2$$\n$$h_0 = \\frac{1}{2}g(\\Delta t_0)^2$$\nSince $\\Delta t_0  0$, we solve for $\\Delta t_0$:\n$$\\Delta t_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2h_0}{g}}$$\nThe velocity just before this first impact, denoted $v_0^{-}$, is:\n$$v_0^{-} = v(\\Delta t_0) = v(0) - g\\Delta t_0 = 0 - g\\sqrt{\\frac{2h_0}{g}} = -\\sqrt{2gh_0}$$\nThis is consistent with the guard condition $v(t)  0$.\n\n**Step 2: Duration of subsequent flights, $\\Delta t_k$ for $k \\ge 1$**\nAn impact occurs at the end of each flight segment. The discrete jump rule for the velocity at the $k$-th impact (where $k=0$ is the first impact) is $v_k^{+} = -\\lambda v_k^{-}$, where $v_k^{-}$ is the pre-impact velocity and $v_k^{+}$ is the post-impact velocity.\n\nFor the first bounce (the flight between the 1st and 2nd impacts, duration $\\Delta t_1$), the initial velocity is $v_0^{+}$:\n$$v_0^{+} = -\\lambda v_0^{-} = -\\lambda (-\\sqrt{2gh_0}) = \\lambda\\sqrt{2gh_0}$$\nThis bounce starts at height $h=0$ with upward velocity $v_0^{+}$. The ball travels up, reaches a peak, and falls back to $h=0$. The duration of this flight, $\\Delta t_1$, is found by setting the height equation to $0$:\n$$h(t) = (v_0^{+})t - \\frac{1}{2}gt^2 = 0$$\n$$t\\left(v_0^{+} - \\frac{1}{2}gt\\right) = 0$$\nThe non-trivial solution for the flight time $t = \\Delta t_1  0$ is:\n$$\\Delta t_1 = \\frac{2v_0^{+}}{g} = \\frac{2\\lambda\\sqrt{2gh_0}}{g}$$\nThe velocity just before the second impact, $v_1^{-}$, is $v_0^{+} - g\\Delta t_1 = v_0^{+} - g\\left(\\frac{2v_0^{+}}{g}\\right) = -v_0^{+}$.

For any flight segment $k \\ge 1$, starting after the $k$-th impact and ending at the $(k+1)$-th impact, the initial velocity is $v_{k-1}^{+}$. The relationship between successive post-impact velocities is $v_k^{+} = \\lambda v_{k-1}^{+}$. By induction, the post-impact velocity after the $k$-th impact is $v_{k-1}^{+} = \\lambda^{k-1}v_0^{+}$.\nThe duration of the flight between the $k$-th and $(k+1)$-th impacts, $\\Delta t_k$ for $k \\ge 1$, is:\n$$\\Delta t_k = \\frac{2v_{k-1}^{+}}{g} = \\frac{2\\lambda^{k-1}v_0^{+}}{g} = \\frac{2\\lambda^{k-1}(\\lambda\\sqrt{2gh_0})}{g} = \\frac{2\\lambda^k\\sqrt{2gh_0}}{g}$$\n\n**Step 3: Calculating the total time, $T_{\\mathrm{Zeno}}$**\nThe total time for an infinite number of impacts is the sum of the durations of all flight segments:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{Zeno}} = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\Delta t_k = \\Delta t_0 + \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\Delta t_k$$\nSubstituting the expressions we derived:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{Zeno}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2h_0}{g}} + \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2\\lambda^k\\sqrt{2gh_0}}{g}$$\nWe can factor out the constants from the summation:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{Zeno}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2h_0}{g}} + \\frac{2\\sqrt{2gh_0}}{g} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\lambda^k$$\nNote that $\\frac{\\sqrt{2gh_0}}{g} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2gh_0}{g^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2h_0}{g}}$. So,\n$$T_{\\mathrm{Zeno}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2h_0}{g}} + 2\\sqrt{\\frac{2h_0}{g}} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\lambda^k$$\nThe summation term is a geometric series $\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\lambda^k = \\lambda + \\lambda^2 + \\lambda^3 + \\dots$.\nThe problem states that the coefficient of restitution satisfies $0 \\le \\lambda  1$. Because the absolute value of the common ratio $|\\lambda|$ is less than $1$, this series converges. This verifies the convergence required by the problem. The sum of this series is:\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\lambda^k = \\frac{\\lambda}{1-\\lambda}$$\nSubstituting this sum back into the expression for $T_{\\mathrm{Zeno}}$:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{Zeno}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2h_0}{g}} + 2\\sqrt{\\frac{2h_0}{g}} \\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{1-\\lambda}\\right)$$\nFactoring out the common term $\\sqrt{\\frac{2h_0}{g}}$:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{Zeno}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2h_0}{g}} \\left(1 + \\frac{2\\lambda}{1-\\lambda}\\right)$$\nTo simplify the expression in the parenthesis:\n$$1 + \\frac{2\\lambda}{1-\\lambda} = \\frac{1-\\lambda}{1-\\lambda} + \\frac{2\\lambda}{1-\\lambda} = \\frac{1 - \\lambda + 2\\lambda}{1-\\lambda} = \\frac{1+\\lambda}{1-\\lambda}$$\nFinally, we obtain the closed-form expression for the Zeno time:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{Zeno}}(h_{0}, g, \\lambda) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2h_0}{g}} \\left(\\frac{1+\\lambda}{1-\\lambda}\\right)$$\nThis expression has units of seconds, as required.",
