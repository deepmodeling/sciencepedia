            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of a given continuous-time, linear time-invariant (LTI) state-space realization to determine if it is minimal. A realization is defined as minimal if and only if it is both controllable (or reachable) and observable (or distinguishable). We will first construct the controllability and observability matrices and then use them to assess these properties.\n\nThe system is described by the state-space equations:\n$$ \\dot{x}(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t) $$\n$$ y(t) = Cx(t) $$\nwith the state vector $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$, input $u \\in \\mathbb{R}$, and output $y \\in \\mathbb{R}$.

A system is controllable if, for any initial state $x(0)$ and any final state $x(t_f)$, there exists a control input $u(t)$ that can drive the state from $x(0)$ to $x(t_f)$ in a finite time $t_f  0$. For an LTI system, this is equivalent to the condition that the controllability matrix, $\\mathcal{C}$, has full rank. The controllability matrix for a system of order $n$ is defined as:\n$$ \\mathcal{C} = \\begin{bmatrix} B  AB  A^2B  \\dots  A^{n-1}B \\end{bmatrix} $$\nFor this system with $n=2$, the controllability matrix is:\n$$ \\mathcal{C} = \\begin{bmatrix} B  AB \\end{bmatrix} $$\nWe proceed with the calculation of the product $AB$:\n$$ AB = \\begin{bmatrix}01\\\\00\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\1\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}(0)(0)+(1)(1)\\\\(0)(0)+(0)(1)\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}1\\\\0\\end{bmatrix} $$\nAssembling the controllability matrix $\\mathcal{C}$ by concatenating the columns $B$ and $AB$:\n$$ \\mathcal{C} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{bmatrix} $$\n\nNext, we address the property of observability. A system is observable if, for any unknown initial state $x(0)$, it is possible to determine this state by observing the system's output $y(t)$ over a finite time interval $t \\in [0, t_f]$ with $t_f  0$. For an LTI system, this is equivalent to the condition that the observability matrix, $\\mathcal{O}$, has full rank.

This requires checking if the system is both controllable and observable.\nThe system is controllable if and only if the rank of $\\mathcal{C}$ is equal to the system order, $n=2$. The rank can be determined by computing the determinant of $\\mathcal{C}$:\n$$ \\det(\\mathcal{C}) = \\det\\left(\\begin{bmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{bmatrix}\\right) = (0)(0) - (1)(1) = -1 $$\nSince $\\det(\\mathcal{C}) \\neq 0$, the matrix $\\mathcal{C}$ has full rank, which is $\\text{rank}(\\mathcal{C}) = 2$. Therefore, the system is controllable.\n\nThe system is observable if and only if the rank of $\\mathcal{O}$ is equal to the system order, $n=2$.

Let $X(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{x(t)\\}$, $U(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{u(t)\\}$, and $Y(s) = \\mathcal{L}\\{y(t)\\}$. The Laplace transform of the state derivative $\\dot{x}(t)$ is $sX(s) - x(0)$. Applying this to the state equation with the zero initial condition $x(0)=0$ yields:\n$$\nsX(s) = AX(s) + BU(s)\n$$\nThe Laplace-transformed output equation is:\n$$\nY(s) = CX(s) + DU(s)\n$$\nNext, we solve the transformed state equation for $X(s)$.\n$$\nsX(s) - AX(s) = BU(s)\n$$\nFactoring out $X(s)$ requires the use of the identity matrix, $I$, of the same dimension as $A$:\n$$\n(sI - A)X(s) = BU(s)\n$$\nTo isolate $X(s)$, we pre-multiply both sides by the inverse of the matrix $(sI - A)$, which is called the resolvent matrix. This is permissible for all values of $s$ for which $(sI - A)$ is invertible, i.e., for which $\\det(sI - A) \\neq 0$.\n$$\nX(s) = (sI - A)^{-1}BU(s)\n$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $X(s)$ into the transformed output equation:\n$$\nY(s) = C\\left((sI - A)^{-1}BU(s)\\right) + DU(s)\n$$\nBy factoring out $U(s)$, we obtain the relationship between $Y(s)$ and $U(s)$:\n$$\nY(s) = \\left[C(sI - A)^{-1}B + D\\right]U(s)\n$$\nFrom the definition of the transfer function, we can now identify $G(s)$:\n$$\nG(s) = C(sI - A)^{-1}B + D\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given matrices into this formula.

The problem is well-posed, objective, and its solution is verifiable through mathematical derivation. There are no scientific flaws, ambiguities, or missing information.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\n#### Analysis of the Exact Inverse Compensator\n\nFirst, we analyze the properties of an ideal feedforward compensator defined by the exact inverse of the plant, $F(s) = G^{-1}(s)$.\nThe plant transfer function is given by:\n$$G(s) = \\frac{s-1}{(s+2)(s+3)}$$\nThe exact inverse is:\n$$G^{-1}(s) = \\frac{(s+2)(s+3)}{s-1} = \\frac{s^2 + 5s + 6}{s-1}$$\n\n**BIBO Stability:** A rational LTI system is BIBO stable if and only if all its poles have strictly negative real parts (i.e., they lie in the open left half of the complex plane). The poles of $G^{-1}(s)$ are the roots of its denominator polynomial, $s-1=0$. This gives a single pole at $s=1$. Since this pole lies in the right-half plane ($\\text{Re}\\{1\\}  0$), the system $G^{-1}(s)$ is **unstable**.\n\n**Causality:** A rational transfer function is causal if the degree of its numerator polynomial is less than or equal to the degree of its denominator polynomial. Such a system is called proper if the degrees are equal, and strictly proper if the numerator degree is smaller. If the numerator degree is greater than the denominator degree, the system is non-causal (or improper). For $G^{-1}(s)$, the degree of the numerator polynomial ($s^2+5s+6$) is $2$, and the degree of the denominator polynomial ($s-1$) is $1$. Since $2  1$, the system $G^{-1}(s)$ is **non-causal**.\n\nAn unstable and non-causal compensator is not physically realizable. Therefore, an approximate inverse must be constructed.\n\n#### Construction of a Stable, Causal, Approximate Inverse\n\nThe primary difficulty arises from the zero of $G(s)$ at $s=1$, which becomes an unstable pole in $G^{-1}(s)$. This is a non-minimum phase zero. The standard method for inverting such a system is to factor the plant $G(s)$ into a minimum-phase part $G_{mp}(s)$ (containing all poles and LHP zeros) and an all-pass part $G_{ap}(s)$ (containing the RHP zeros).\n\nThe RHP zero is at $s=1$. The corresponding all-pass factor, which has unity magnitude for all frequencies $s=j\\omega$, is constructed by pairing the RHP zero with a stable pole at its reflection across the imaginary axis, $s=-1$:\n$$G_{ap}(s) = \\frac{1-s}{1+s} = -\\frac{s-1}{s+1}$$\nThe minimum-phase part is then found by dividing the original plant by the all-pass factor:\n$$G_{mp}(s) = \\frac{G(s)}{G_{ap}(s)} = \\frac{s-1}{(s+2)(s+3)} \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{s+1}{s-1}\\right) = -\\frac{s+1}{(s+2)(s+3)}$$\nSo, the plant is factored as $G(s) = G_{mp}(s) G_{ap}(s)$.\n\nA practical feedforward controller inverts only the well-behaved minimum-phase part, $G_{mp}(s)$. An initial attempt for the compensator would be $F_{ideal}(s) = G_{mp}^{-1}(s)$:\n$$F_{ideal}(s) = \\left(-\\frac{s+1}{(s+2)(s+3)}\\right)^{-1} = -\\frac{(s+2)(s+3)}{s+1}$$\nThis intermediate form has a stable pole at $s=-1$. However, its numerator degree ($2$) is greater than its denominator degree ($1$), so it is improper and thus non-causal.\n\nTo satisfy the design constraints, we must modify $F_{ideal}(s)$:\n1.  **Properness:** To make the compensator proper, we must add poles to increase the denominator degree until it is at least equal to the numerator degree. $F_{ideal}(s)$ has a relative degree of $-1$ (numerator degree minus denominator degree is $2-1=1$). To achieve a proper transfer function (relative degree $0$), we need to multiply it by a filter with a relative degree of at least $1$. The minimum order to achieve this is a first-order filter.\n2.  **Prefilter and Parameter $\\omega_c$:** Constraint $5$ requires adding a \"strictly stable prefilter factor used to achieve properness\" with \"unity direct-current (DC) gain\" and a tuning parameter $\\omega_c  0$. A first-order low-pass filter of the form $L(s) = \\frac{\\omega_c}{s+\\omega_c}$ satisfies these requirements perfectly.\n    - It is strictly stable since $\\omega_c  0$.\n    - Its DC gain is $L(0) = \\frac{\\omega_c}{0+\\omega_c} = 1$.\n    - Its relative degree is $1$, which is exactly what is needed to make the overall compensator proper.\n    - It introduces the parameter $\\omega_c$ which defines the filter's bandwidth.\n\nThe final form of the compensator $F(s)$ is the product of the inverted minimum-phase part and this low-pass filter:\n$$F(s) = F_{ideal}(s) \\cdot L(s) = \\left(-\\frac{(s+2)(s+3)}{s+1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\omega_c}{s+\\omega_c}\\right)$$\nThis compensator $F(s)$ satisfies all constraints:\n- **Stability:** Its poles are at $s=-1$ and $s=-\\omega_c$. Since $\\omega_c  0$, both poles are in the open left half-plane.\n- **Properness:** The numerator degree is $2$ and the denominator degree is $2$. It is proper.\n- **Low-frequency Tracking:** We check the DC gain of the full loop $F(s)G(s)$.\n  $$ \\lim_{s \\to 0} F(s)G(s) = F(0)G(0) $$\n  $$ F(0) = \\left(-\\frac{(0+2)(0+3)}{0+1}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\omega_c}{0+\\omega_c}\\right) = (-6)(1) = -6 $$\n  $$ G(0) = \\frac{0-1}{(0+2)(0+3)} = -\\frac{1}{6} $$\n  $$ F(0)G(0) = (-6)\\left(-\\frac{1}{6}\\right) = 1 $$\n  The tracking condition is met. This works because $F(s)$ inverts the DC gain of $G_{mp}(s)$ and the filter $L(s)$ has unity DC gain, so $F(0)G_{mp}(0)=1$. The total loop gain at DC is $F(0)G(0) = F(0)G_{mp}(0)G_{ap}(0) = 1 \\cdot G_{ap}(0)$. Since $G_{ap}(0) = \\frac{1-0}{1+0} = 1$, the condition holds.\n- **Minimum Order:** The base part of the compensator, $G_{mp}^{-1}(s)$, already has an order of $1$. To make it proper, we must add a filter of at least order $1$. Thus, the minimum possible order for the final compensator $F(s)$ is $1+1=2$. Our design has an order of $2$.\n\nThe final expression for the compensator is:\n$$F(s) = -\\frac{\\omega_c(s+2)(s+3)}{(s+1)(s+\\omega_c)} = \\frac{-\\omega_c(s^2 + 5s + 6)}{(s+1)(s+\\omega_c)}$$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression in terms of $s$ and $\\omega_c$.",
