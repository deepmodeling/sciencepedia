            "problem": "A Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) in an Industrial Control System (ICS) must encrypt a continuous command stream from a Human-Machine Interface (HMI) using Advanced Encryption Standard in Galois/Counter Mode (AES-GCM). The PLC has a single-core processor of frequency $f$ cycles per second. The AES-GCM implementation incurs a per-byte cost of $c_b$ cycles per byte for the payload and a fixed per-packet setup cost of $c_o$ cycles per packet due to initialization (for example, initialization vector processing and hash subkey setup). The stream arrives as fixed-size packets of length $L$ bytes at an average arrival rate of $R$ bytes per second. The real-time scheduler allocates a fraction $B$ of the CPU to cryptographic tasks to ensure control-loop deadlines are met.\n\nStarting only from the definitions that a processor of frequency $f$ provides $f$ cycles per second, that utilization is the fraction of available cycles consumed, and that cycles per second consumed is the rate of events multiplied by cycles per event, derive an expression for the cryptographic CPU utilization $u$ and then evaluate it for the following parameters:\n- $R = 1.20 \\times 10^{7}$ bytes/s,\n- $L = 1000$ bytes,\n- $c_b = 30$ cycles/byte,\n- $c_o = 5000$ cycles/packet,\n- $f = 6.00 \\times 10^{8}$ cycles/s,\n- $B = 0.65$.\n\nThen determine, based on the derived utilization, whether the AES-GCM encryption fits within the PLC’s compute budget allocated to cryptographic tasks.

All necessary data and definitions are provided to derive a unique and meaningful solution. The problem is a standard performance analysis exercise in embedded systems engineering. Therefore, a full solution can be derived.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the cryptographic CPU utilization, $u$, and then evaluate it to determine if it fits within the allocated computational budget. The derivation begins from the fundamental principles provided.\n\nThe total number of CPU cycles available per second is equal to the processor's frequency, $f$.\n$$ \\text{Available cycles per second} = f $$\nThe total number of cycles consumed per second by the cryptographic task, which we denote as $C_{crypto}$, must be calculated. The workload consists of two components: a fixed cost per packet and a variable cost per byte.\n\nFirst, we determine the rate at which packets arrive. Given a continuous stream arriving at an average rate of $R$ bytes per second, composed of packets of a fixed length $L$ bytes, the packet arrival rate, $R_p$, is:\n$$ R_p = \\frac{R}{L} $$\nThese packets are processed at a unit of packets per second.\n\nThe cryptographic workload consumes cycles from two distinct operations:\n1.  Per-packet setup cost: A fixed number of cycles, $c_o$, is consumed for each packet. The total cycles per second for this overhead is the packet rate $R_p$ multiplied by the cost per packet $c_o$.\n    $$ C_{setup} = R_p \\cdot c_o = \\left(\\frac{R}{L}\\right) c_o $$\n\n2.  Per-byte processing cost: A number of cycles, $c_b$, is consumed for each byte of the payload. The total cycles per second for payload processing is the byte rate $R$ multiplied by the cost per byte $c_b$.\n    $$ C_{payload} = R \\cdot c_b $$\n\nThe total cycles per second consumed by the AES-GCM encryption is the sum of the setup and payload processing costs:\n$$ C_{crypto} = C_{payload} + C_{setup} = R c_b + \\frac{R}{L} c_o $$\n\nCPU utilization, $u$, is defined as the fraction of available cycles consumed. It is the ratio of the total cycles consumed per second to the total cycles available per second.\n$$ u = \\frac{C_{crypto}}{f} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_{crypto}$ gives the general formula for the cryptographic CPU utilization:\n$$ u = \\frac{R c_b + \\frac{R}{L} c_o}{f} $$\nThis expression can be factored to a more convenient form:\n$$ u = \\frac{R}{f} \\left( c_b + \\frac{c_o}{L} \\right) $$\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression using the provided numerical parameters:\n- $R = 1.20 \\times 10^{7}$ bytes/s\n- $L = 1000$ bytes\n- $c_b = 30$ cycles/byte\n- $c_o = 5000$ cycles/packet\n- $f = 6.00 \\times 10^{8}$ cycles/s\n- $B = 0.65$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula for $u$:\n$$ u = \\frac{1.20 \\times 10^{7}}{6.00 \\times 10^{8}} \\left( 30 + \\frac{5000}{1000} \\right) $$\nFirst, we evaluate the term representing the effective cycles per byte:\n$$ c_b' = c_b + \\frac{c_o}{L} = 30 + \\frac{5000}{1000} = 30 + 5 = 35 \\text{ cycles/byte} $$\nNext, we evaluate the pre-factor:\n$$ \\frac{R}{f} = \\frac{1.20 \\times 10^{7}}{6.00 \\times 10^{8}} = \\frac{1.20}{60.0} = 0.02 $$\nThe utilization $u$ is the product of these two results:\n$$ u = 0.02 \\times 35 = 0.7 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ u = 0.7000 $$\n\nFinally, we must determine if this utilization fits within the PLC's compute budget, $B$, allocated to cryptographic tasks. The budget is given as $B = 0.65$. We compare the calculated utilization $u$ with the budget $B$:\n$$ u = 0.7000 $$\n$$ B = 0.65 $$\nSince $0.7000 > 0.65$, the required CPU utilization for the AES-GCM encryption exceeds the allocated budget.

The cyclic scheduler enforces a period of $T_{c} = 1\\ \\mathrm{ms}$ on a dedicated full-duplex $100\\ \\mathrm{Mb/s}$ Ethernet link. Each cyclic frame carries an application payload of $S_{p} = 100\\ \\mathrm{bytes}$.

It is based on standard principles of computer networking, specifically the timing analysis of packet transmission over an Ethernet link. The parameters provided ($100\\ \\mathrm{Mb/s}$, $1\\ \\mathrm{ms}$ cycle, frame component sizes) are realistic for industrial communication systems like PROFINET RT. The problem is self-contained, providing all necessary data to calculate frame transmission times and network utilization. The request is unambiguous: compute the maximum payload throughput and the available security overhead budget based on a deterministic scheduling model. There are no contradictions, factual errors, or subjective elements.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\nThe solution requires calculating the total time consumed by a single frame transmission event on the network, determining the maximum number of such events that can fit into the cyclic period, and then using this number to compute the payload throughput and the security overhead budget.\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental time units based on the line rate. The line rate is $R = 100\\ \\mathrm{Mb/s} = 100 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{bits/s}$.\nThe time to transmit a single bit, $t_{bit}$, is the reciprocal of the line rate:\n$$t_{bit} = \\frac{1}{R} = \\frac{1}{100 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{s} = 10\\ \\mathrm{ns}$$\nSince $1\\ \\mathrm{byte} = 8\\ \\mathrm{bits}$, the time to transmit a single byte, $t_{byte}$, is:\n$$t_{byte} = 8 \\times t_{bit} = 8 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{s} = 80\\ \\mathrm{ns}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the total time consumed by one complete frame transmission event. This includes the serialization of the frame itself and the subsequent idle time of the interframe gap (IFG). Let's first analyze the case without any security header ($h=0$), which is used to determine the maximum number of frames per cycle.\n\nThe total size of the Ethernet frame to be transmitted on the wire, $S_{frame,0}$, is the sum of its components:\n$$S_{frame,0} = S_{pre\\_sfd} + S_{mac} + S_{p} + S_{fcs}$$\n$$S_{frame,0} = 8\\ \\mathrm{bytes} + 14\\ \\mathrm{bytes} + 100\\ \\mathrm{bytes} + 4\\ \\mathrm{bytes} = 126\\ \\mathrm{bytes}$$\nThe interframe gap is specified as an idle time equivalent to transmitting $S_{ifg} = 12\\ \\mathrm{bytes}$.\nTherefore, the total \"time-equivalent size\" of one frame event, $S_{event,0}$, is the sum of the frame size and the IFG equivalent size:\n$$S_{event,0} = S_{frame,0} + S_{ifg} = 126\\ \\mathrm{bytes} + 12\\ \\mathrm{bytes} = 138\\ \\mathrm{bytes}$$\nThe time taken for one complete frame event, $T_{event,0}$, is then:\n$$T_{event,0} = S_{event,0} \\times t_{byte} = 138 \\times 80\\ \\mathrm{ns} = 11040\\ \\mathrm{ns} = 11.04\\ \\mathrm{\\mu s}$$\n\nThe scheduler has a cyclic period of $T_{c} = 1\\ \\mathrm{ms} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{\\mu s}$. The maximum number of frames, $N_{max}$, that can be packed into one cycle is given by the floor of the ratio of the cycle period to the time per frame event:\n$$N_{max} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{T_{c}}{T_{event,0}} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{1000\\ \\mathrm{\\mu s}}{11.04\\ \\mathrm{\\mu s}} \\right\\rfloor = \\lfloor 90.579...\\rfloor = 90$$\nSo, a maximum of $90$ frames can be transmitted per cycle.\n\nWith $N_{max}$ determined, we can calculate the maximum sustained payload throughput, $R_{p}$. The total payload data transmitted per cycle is:\n$$D_{payload} = N_{max} \\times S_{p} = 90 \\times 100\\ \\mathrm{bytes} = 9000\\ \\mathrm{bytes}$$\nThe throughput is this amount of data divided by the cycle time, $T_c$. We convert bytes to bits ($1\\ \\mathrm{byte} = 8\\ \\mathrm{bits}$) to express the result in $\\mathrm{Mb/s}$.\n$$R_{p} = \\frac{D_{payload}}{T_{c}} = \\frac{9000\\ \\mathrm{bytes} \\times 8\\ \\mathrm{bits/byte}}{1\\ \\mathrm{ms}} = \\frac{72000\\ \\mathrm{bits}}{1 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}} = 72 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{bits/s} = 72\\ \\mathrm{Mb/s}$$\nThis is the first part of the answer.\n\nFor the second part, we need to find the aggregate margin for security headers. We must maintain the same number of frames per cycle, $N_{max} = 90$. The total time consumed by these $90$ frames without any security headers is:\n$$T_{used,0} = N_{max} \\times T_{event,0} = 90 \\times 11.04\\ \\mathrm{\\mu s} = 993.6\\ \\mathrm{\\mu s}$$\nThe total time available in the cycle is $T_{c} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{\\mu s}$. The spare time, $T_{spare}$, is the difference:\n$$T_{spare} = T_{c} - T_{used,0} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{\\mu s} - 993.6\\ \\mathrm{\\mu s} = 6.4\\ \\mathrm{\\mu s}$$\nThis spare time can be allocated to the transmission of additional security headers across all $90$ frames. The problem asks for the aggregate margin in bytes per cycle, which we denote as $H_{agg}$. This total number of bytes must be transmitted within the spare time $T_{spare}$.\n$$H_{agg} = \\frac{T_{spare}}{t_{byte}} = \\frac{6.4\\ \\mathrm{\\mu s}}{80\\ \\mathrm{ns/byte}} = \\frac{6.4 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{s}}{80 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{s/byte}} = \\frac{6400 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{s}}{80 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{s/byte}} = \\frac{6400}{80}\\ \\mathrm{bytes} = 80\\ \\mathrm{bytes}$$\nThus, the aggregate margin that can be consumed by security headers across all $90$ frames is $80\\ \\mathrm{bytes}$ per cycle.\n\nThe final answer requires a row matrix containing the payload throughput in $\\mathrm{Mb/s}$ and the aggregate per-cycle security header budget in bytes. These values are $72$ and $80$, respectively.",

The open-loop transfer function is given by:\n$$L(s) = \\frac{K_{c}}{s} \\exp(-s T_{s})$$\nWe are given the parameters $K_{c} = 3$ and $T_{s} = 0.4$.\n\nTo find the stability margins, we first determine the frequency response of the system by substituting $s = j\\omega$, where $\\omega$ is the angular frequency in radians per second.\n$$L(j\\omega) = \\frac{K_{c}}{j\\omega} \\exp(-j\\omega T_{s})$$\nThe magnitude $|L(j\\omega)|$ and phase angle $\\angle L(j\\omega)$ of the frequency response are found as follows.\nThe magnitude is:\n$$|L(j\\omega)| = \\left| \\frac{K_{c}}{j\\omega} \\right| \\left| \\exp(-j\\omega T_{s}) \\right| = \\frac{K_{c}}{\\omega} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{K_{c}}{\\omega}$$\nThe phase angle is the sum of the angles of the individual components:\n$$\\angle L(j\\omega) = \\angle(K_c) + \\angle\\left(\\frac{1}{j\\omega}\\right) + \\angle(\\exp(-j\\omega T_{s}))$$\nSince $K_c$ is a positive real number, its angle is $0$. The term $1/(j\\omega)$ is equivalent to $-j/\\omega$, which has a constant phase of $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ radians. The term $\\exp(-j\\omega T_{s})$ contributes a phase lag of $-\\omega T_{s}$ radians.\n$$\\angle L(j\\omega) = 0 - \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\omega T_{s} = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\omega T_{s}$$\n\n**Phase Margin Calculation**\nThe phase margin is determined at the gain crossover frequency, $\\omega_{gc}$, which is the frequency at which the magnitude of the open-loop gain is unity ($1$).\n$$|L(j\\omega_{gc})| = 1$$\n$$\\frac{K_{c}}{\\omega_{gc}} = 1 \\implies \\omega_{gc} = K_{c}$$\nWith $K_{c} = 3$, the gain crossover frequency is $\\omega_{gc} = 3\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$.\n\nThe phase margin ($PM$) is the amount of additional phase lag required to bring the system to the stability limit at the gain crossover frequency. It is defined as:\n$$PM = \\pi + \\angle L(j\\omega_{gc})$$\nSubstituting the expression for the phase and the value of $\\omega_{gc}$:\n$$PM = \\pi + \\left( -\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\omega_{gc} T_{s} \\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - K_{c} T_{s}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values, $K_{c} = 3$ and $T_{s} = 0.4$:\n$$PM = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - (3)(0.4) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} - 1.2$$\nNumerically, this is:\n$$PM \\approx 1.570796 - 1.2 = 0.370796\\,\\mathrm{rad}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the phase margin is $0.3708\\,\\mathrm{rad}$.\n\n**Gain Margin Calculation**\nThe gain margin is determined at the phase crossover frequency, $\\omega_{pc}$, which is the frequency at which the phase angle is $-\\pi$ radians ($-180^\\circ$).\n$$\\angle L(j\\omega_{pc}) = -\\pi$$\n$$-\\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\omega_{pc} T_{s} = -\\pi$$\nSolving for $\\omega_{pc}$:\n$$\\omega_{pc} T_{s} = \\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$$\n$$\\omega_{pc} = \\frac{\\pi}{2 T_{s}}$$\nWith $T_{s} = 0.4$, the phase crossover frequency is:\n$$\\omega_{pc} = \\frac{\\pi}{2(0.4)} = \\frac{\\pi}{0.8} = 1.25\\pi \\approx 3.92699\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$$\nThe gain margin ($GM$) is the reciprocal of the magnitude of the open-loop transfer function at the phase crossover frequency.\n$$GM = \\frac{1}{|L(j\\omega_{pc})|}$$\nFirst, we find the magnitude at $\\omega_{pc}$:\n$$|L(j\\omega_{pc})| = \\frac{K_{c}}{\\omega_{pc}} = \\frac{K_{c}}{\\pi / (2T_{s})} = \\frac{2 K_{c} T_{s}}{\\pi}$$\nTherefore, the gain margin is:\n$$GM = \\frac{\\pi}{2 K_{c} T_{s}}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$GM = \\frac{\\pi}{2(3)(0.4)} = \\frac{\\pi}{2.4}$$\nNumerically, this is:\n$$GM \\approx \\frac{3.14159265}{2.4} \\approx 1.308997$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the gain margin is $1.309$.\n\n**Stability Policy Evaluation**\nThe problem states that the ICS requires a phase margin of at least $0.5236\\,\\mathrm{rad}$ and a gain margin of at least $2$. Let's compare our computed values to these requirements.\n\n*   Phase Margin: The computed phase margin is $PM \\approx 0.3708\\,\\mathrm{rad}$. The requirement is $PM \\ge 0.5236\\,\\mathrm{rad}$. Since $0.3708 < 0.5236$, the phase margin requirement is **not met**.\n*   Gain Margin: The computed gain margin is $GM \\approx 1.309$. The requirement is $GM \\ge 2$. Since $1.309 < 2$, the gain margin requirement is **not met**.\n\n**Conclusion on Retuning**\nBoth the phase margin and the gain margin are below the minimum acceptable levels stipulated by the stability-preserving policy. The reduced stability margins are a direct consequence of the latency introduced by the security layers. To restore the system's robustness and comply with the operational policy, the controller must be retuned. A common approach would be to reduce the controller gain $K_c$, which would increase both the phase margin (since $PM = \\pi/2 - K_c T_s$) and the gain margin (since $GM = \\pi / (2 K_c T_s)$), at the expense of a slower system response. Therefore, **retuning is required**.\n\nThe final numerical answer is the row matrix of the computed phase margin and gain margin.\nPhase Margin: $0.3708$\nGain Margin: $1.309$\nThe final answer is presented as $\\begin{pmatrix} 0.3708 & 1.309 \\end{pmatrix}$.",
