Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) decisions are evaluated by deriving a predicate from policy rules and attribute facts under the least fixed-point semantics of Horn clauses in Datalog. Consider the access request to perform a reconfiguration action on a PLC instance. Encode the ABAC policy as Datalog-style rules (using Horn clauses) that integrate a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) gate, training certification, clearance versus resource criticality, Digital Twin maintenance state, risk threshold comparison, network zone matching, and separation-of-duty with the last actor attribute. Then, using the provided attribute facts, compute the decision for the specific request by showing a complete derivation from the rules and facts.\n\nPolicy requirements to encode:\n- RBAC gate: the requesting user must hold a role that is authorized for the requested action.\n- Training certification: the requesting user must possess training that covers the resource’s type.\n- Clearance dominance: the user’s clearance level must be greater than or equal to the resource’s criticality level, where levels form a partial order.\n- Digital Twin maintenance state: the resource must be in a state that indicates a maintenance window in the Digital Twin.\n- Risk threshold: the resource’s current risk level must be less than or equal to the action’s threshold as defined by policy.\n- Network zone matching: the user’s request zone must match the resource’s zone.\n- Separation-of-duty: the requesting user must be distinct from the last actor who performed an operation on the resource.\n\nUse the following concrete attribute facts for the test case:\n- The request is: $\\text{request}(u_A, \\text{reconfigure}, \\text{PLC7\\_23})$.\n- RBAC attributes and permission: $\\text{has\\_role}(u_A, \\text{MaintEngineer})$, $\\text{role\\_can}(\\text{MaintEngineer}, \\text{reconfigure})$.\n- Training and resource type: $\\text{trained\\_for}(u_A, \\text{PLC\\_Type\\_S7})$, $\\text{res\\_type}(\\text{PLC7\\_23}, \\text{PLC\\_Type\\_S7})$.\n- Clearance and criticality: $\\text{clearance}(u_A, \\mathrm{L3})$, $\\text{criticality}(\\text{PLC7\\_23}, \\mathrm{L2})$, $\\text{geq}(\\mathrm{L3}, \\mathrm{L2})$.\n- Digital Twin state: $\\text{twin\\_state}(\\text{PLC7\\_23}, \\text{maintenance\\_mode})$.\n- Risk and threshold lattice: $\\text{risk}(\\text{PLC7\\_23}, \\text{med})$, $\\text{threshold}(\\text{reconfigure}, \\text{med})$, $\\text{leq}(\\text{low}, \\text{med})$, $\\text{leq}(\\text{med}, \\text{med})$, $\\text{leq}(\\text{low}, \\text{high})$, $\\text{leq}(\\text{med}, \\text{high})$.\n- Network zones: $\\text{req\\_zone}(u_A, \\text{plant\\_net})$, $\\text{res\\_zone}(\\text{PLC7\\_23}, \\text{plant\\_net})$.\n- Separation-of-duty attributes: $\\text{last\\_actor}(\\text{PLC7\\_23}, u_B)$, $\\text{distinct}(u_A, u_B)$.\n\nYou must:\n1.

            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of logic programming (Datalog, Horn clauses, least fixed-point semantics) and their application to formalizing Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) policies, a standard and rigorous approach in computer security. The problem is well-posed, providing a complete and consistent set of facts and policy rules, which guarantees a unique and computable solution. The terminology is objective and precise, meeting all criteria for a valid problem.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two stages. First, the natural language policy requirements are encoded into a set of Datalog-style Horn clauses. Second, a logical derivation is performed to determine if the access request should be permitted, by evaluating whether the predicate $\\text{permit}(u_A, \\text{reconfigure}, \\text{PLC7\\_23})$ can be proven true from the encoded rules and the given attribute facts.\n\n**1. Encoding the ABAC Policy into Datalog Rules**\n\nLet $U$ be a user variable, $A$ be an action variable, and $R$ be a resource variable. The main access control decision is captured by the predicate $\\text{permit}(U, A, R)$, which is true if and only if all seven policy conditions are met. We define this with a top-level Horn clause that relies on seven intermediate predicates, each corresponding to one policy requirement.\n\nThe main rule is:\n$$ \\text{permit}(U, A, R) \\;:-\\; \\text{check\\_rbac}(U, A), \\text{check\\_training}(U, R), \\text{check\\_clearance}(U, R), \\text{check\\_dt\\_state}(R), \\text{check\\_risk}(A, R), \\text{check\\_zone}(U, R), \\text{check\\_sod}(U, R). $$\n\nThe seven intermediate predicates are defined by the following rules:\n\n1.  **RBAC gate**: The user $U$ must have a role that is authorized for the action $A$.\n    $$ \\text{check\\_rbac}(U, A) \\;:-\\; \\text{has\\_role}(U, \\text{Role}), \\text{role\\_can}(\\text{Role}, A). $$\n\n2.  **Training certification**: The user $U$ must be trained for the specific type of the resource $R$.\n    $$ \\text{check\\_training}(U, R) \\;:-\\; \\text{trained\\_for}(U, \\text{Type}), \\text{res\\_type}(R, \\text{Type}). $$\n\n3.  **Clearance dominance**: The user's clearance level $C_{\\text{level}}$ must be greater than or equal to the resource's criticality level $R_{\\text{level}}$. This is checked using a given partial order predicate $\\text{geq}$.\n    $$ \\text{check\\_clearance}(U, R) \\;:-\\; \\text{clearance}(U, C_{\\text{level}}), \\text{criticality}(R, R_{\\text{level}}), \\text{geq}(C_{\\text{level}}, R_{\\text{level}}). $$\n\n4.  **Digital Twin maintenance state**: The resource $R$ must be in the $\\text{maintenance\\_mode}$ state in its Digital Twin.\n    $$ \\text{check\\_dt\\_state}(R) \\;:-\\; \\text{twin\\_state}(R, \\text{maintenance\\_mode}). $$\n\n5.  **Risk threshold**: The current risk level of the resource $R$, $R_{\\text{risk}}$, must be less than or equal to the action's risk threshold $A_{\\text{thresh}}$. This is checked using a given partial order predicate $\\text{leq}$.\n    $$ \\text{check\\_risk}(A, R) \\;:-\\; \\text{risk}(R, R_{\\text{risk}}), \\text{threshold}(A, A_{\\text{thresh}}), \\text{leq}(R_{\\text{risk}}, A_{\\text{thresh}}). $$\n\n6.  **Network zone matching**: The user's request zone $Z$ must be identical to the resource's zone.\n    $$ \\text{check\\_zone}(U, R) \\;:-\\; \\text{req\\_zone}(U, Z), \\text{res\\_zone}(R, Z). $$\n\n7.  **Separation-of-duty**: The user $U$ must be distinct from the last user, $\\text{LastU}$, who operated on the resource $R$.\n    $$ \\text{check\\_sod}(U, R) \\;:-\\; \\text{last\\_actor}(R, \\text{LastU}), \\text{distinct}(U, \\text{LastU}). $$\n\n**2. Derivation of the Access Decision**\n\nWe now evaluate the goal $\\text{permit}(u_A, \\text{reconfigure}, \\text{PLC7\\_23})$ by proving that each of the seven sub-goals in the body of the main rule is true for the specific request. The variables are instantiated as $U=u_A$, $A=\\text{reconfigure}$, and $R=\\text{PLC7\\_23}$.\n\n*   **Derivation of $\\text{check\\_rbac}(u_A, \\text{reconfigure})$:**\n    The rule is $\\text{check\\_rbac}(U, A) \\;:-\\; \\text{has\\_role}(U, \\text{Role}), \\text{role\\_can}(\\text{Role}, A)$.\n    With $U=u_A$ and $A=\\text{reconfigure}$, we need to find a $\\text{Role}$ such that $\\text{has\\_role}(u_A, \\text{Role})$ and $\\text{role\\_can}(\\text{Role}, \\text{reconfigure})$ are true.\n    The facts provide $\\text{has\\_role}(u_A, \\text{MaintEngineer})$. Let $\\text{Role} = \\text{MaintEngineer}$.\n    The facts also provide $\\text{role\\_can}(\\text{MaintEngineer}, \\text{reconfigure})$.\n    Both conditions are met. Thus, $\\text{check\\_rbac}(u_A, \\text{reconfigure})$ is **true**.\n\n*   **Derivation of $\\text{check\\_training}(u_A, \\text{PLC7\\_23})$:**\n    The rule is $\\text{check\\_training}(U, R) \\;:-\\; \\text{trained\\_for}(U, \\text{Type}), \\text{res\\_type}(R, \\text{Type})$.\n    With $U=u_A$ and $R=\\text{PLC7\\_23}$, we need a common $\\text{Type}$.\n    The facts provide $\\text{trained\\_for}(u_A, \\text{PLC\\_Type\\_S7})$. Let $\\text{Type} = \\text{PLC\\_Type\\_S7}$.\n    The facts also provide $\\text{res\\_type}(\\text{PLC7\\_23}, \\text{PLC\\_Type\\_S7})$.\n    Both conditions are met with the same $\\text{Type}$. Thus, $\\text{check\\_training}(u_A, \\text{PLC7\\_23})$ is **true**.\n\n*   **Derivation of $\\text{check\\_clearance}(u_A, \\text{PLC7\\_23})$:**\n    The rule is $\\text{check\\_clearance}(U, R) \\;:-\\; \\text{clearance}(U, C_{\\text{level}}), \\text{criticality}(R, R_{\\text{level}}), \\text{geq}(C_{\\text{level}}, R_{\\text{level}})$.\n    From facts: $\\text{clearance}(u_A, \\mathrm{L3})$ gives $C_{\\text{level}} = \\mathrm{L3}$.\n    From facts: $\\text{criticality}(\\text{PLC7\\_23}, \\mathrm{L2})$ gives $R_{\\text{level}} = \\mathrm{L2}$.\n    The third condition is to check if $\\text{geq}(\\mathrm{L3}, \\mathrm{L2})$ is true. This is given as a fact.\n    All conditions are met. Thus, $\\text{check\\_clearance}(u_A, \\text{PLC7\\_23})$ is **true**.\n\n*   **Derivation of $\\text{check\\_dt\\_state}(\\text{PLC7\\_23})$:**\n    The rule is $\\text{check\\_dt\\_state}(R) \\;:-\\; \\text{twin\\_state}(R, \\text{maintenance\\_mode})$.\n    With $R=\\text{PLC7\\_23}$, we check the fact $\\text{twin\\_state}(\\text{PLC7\\_23}, \\text{maintenance\\_mode})$.\n    This is provided as a fact. Thus, $\\text{check\\_dt\\_state}(\\text{PLC7\\_23})$ is **true**.\n\n*   **Derivation of $\\text{check\\_risk}(\\text{reconfigure}, \\text{PLC7\\_23})$:**\n    The rule is $\\text{check\\_risk}(A, R) \\;:-\\; \\text{risk}(R, R_{\\text{risk}}), \\text{threshold}(A, A_{\\text{thresh}}), \\text{leq}(R_{\\text{risk}}, A_{\\text{thresh}})$.\n    From facts: $\\text{risk}(\\text{PLC7\\_23}, \\text{med})$ gives $R_{\\text{risk}} = \\text{med}$.\n    From facts: $\\text{threshold}(\\text{reconfigure}, \\text{med})$ gives $A_{\\text{thresh}} = \\text{med}$.\n    The third condition is to check if $\\text{leq}(\\text{med}, \\text{med})$ is true. This is given as a fact.\n    All conditions are met. Thus, $\\text{check\\_risk}(\\text{reconfigure}, \\text{PLC7\\_23})$ is **true**.\n\n*   **Derivation of $\\text{check\\_zone}(u_A, \\text{PLC7\\_23})$:**\n    The rule is $\\text{check\\_zone}(U, R) \\;:-\\; \\text{req\\_zone}(U, Z), \\text{res\\_zone}(R, Z)$.\n    With $U=u_A$ and $R=\\text{PLC7\\_23}$, we need a common zone $Z$.\n    From facts: $\\text{req\\_zone}(u_A, \\text{plant\\_net})$. Let $Z = \\text{plant\\_net}$.\n    From facts: $\\text{res\\_zone}(\\text{PLC7\\_23}, \\text{plant\\_net})$.\n    Both refer to the same zone. Thus, $\\text{check\\_zone}(u_A, \\text{PLC7\\_23})$ is **true**.\n\n*   **Derivation of $\\text{check\\_sod}(u_A, \\text{PLC7\\_23})$:**\n    The rule is $\\text{check\\_sod}(U, R) \\;:-\\; \\text{last\\_actor}(R, \\text{LastU}), \\text{distinct}(U, \\text{LastU})$.\n    With $U=u_A$ and $R=\\text{PLC7\\_23}$:\n    From facts: $\\text{last\\_actor}(\\text{PLC7\\_23}, u_B)$ gives $\\text{LastU} = u_B$.\n    The second condition is to check if $\\text{distinct}(u_A, u_B)$ is true. This is given as a fact.\n    Both conditions are met. Thus, $\\text{check\\_sod}(u_A, \\text{PLC7\\_23})$ is **true**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe main rule is instantiated as:\n$$ \\text{permit}(u_A, \\text{reconfigure}, \\text{PLC7\\_23}) \\;:-\\; \\text{check\\_rbac}(\\dots), \\text{check\\_training}(\\dots), \\dots, \\text{check\\_sod}(\\dots). $$\nAs demonstrated, all seven predicates in the body of the rule have been proven to be true based on the provided facts. In the least fixed-point semantics of Datalog, since all antecedents of a rule are true, the consequent is also true. Therefore, the predicate $\\text{permit}(u_A, \\text{reconfigure}, \\text{PLC7\\_23})$ is derived to be true.\n\nThe problem requires the final decision to be expressed as a number, with $1$ for permit and $0$ for deny. Since the access request is permitted, the resulting value is $1$.",

The user $u$ is assigned the role $r_{\\mathrm{new}}$: $(u, r_{\\mathrm{new}}) \\in UA$.\n2.

This also adds $1$ element to $\\Delta PA$.\n\nThe goal is to cover all PLCs in $S=\\{1,2,3,4,5,7,9\\}$ with the minimum number of such assignments. Let's analyze the attributes of all $12$ PLCs:\n$s(1)=(Z_1,A,0)$, $s(2)=(Z_1,A,0)$, $s(3)=(Z_1,B,0)$, $s(4)=(Z_2,A,0)$, $s(5)=(Z_2,A,0)$, $s(6)=(Z_2,B,1)$, $s(7)=(Z_3,A,0)$, $s(8)=(Z_3,A,0)$, $s(9)=(Z_3,B,0)$, $s(10)=(Z_3,B,1)$, $s(11)=(Z_2,B,0)$, $s(12)=(Z_1,B,1)$.\nThe target set is $S=\\{1,2,3,4,5,7,9\\}$.

The remaining PLCs with $C(i)=0$ are $\\{1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9,11\\}$.\n\nWe can partition this set by their $(Z,V)$ attributes to identify potential group assignments:\n- Set $G_1 = \\{i \\mid Z(i)=Z_1, V(i)=A, C(i)=0\\} = \\{1,2\\}$.

Since $G_2 \\subseteq S$, a group assignment for $(Z_1, B)$ is valid. It covers one PLC, $\\{3\\}$, with $1$ PA entry. A per-resource assignment would achieve the same.\n- Set $G_3 = \\{i \\mid Z(i)=Z_2, V(i)=A, C(i)=0\\} = \\{4,5\\}$. Since $G_3 \\subseteq S$, a group assignment for $(Z_2, A)$ is valid. It covers two PLCs, $\\{4,5\\}$, with $1$ PA entry.\n- Set $G_4 = \\{i \\mid Z(i)=Z_2, V(i)=B, C(i)=0\\} = \\{11\\}$. Since $11 \\notin S$, this group assignment is not useful for covering any PLC in $S$.\n- Set $G_5 = \\{i \\mid Z(i)=Z_3, V(i)=A, C(i)=0\\} = \\{7,8\\}$. Since $8 \\notin S$, this set is not a subset of $S$. Therefore, a group assignment for $(Z_3, A)$ is forbidden.\n- Set $G_6 = \\{i \\mid Z(i)=Z_3, V(i)=B, C(i)=0\\} = \\{9\\}$.

This costs $1$ PA entry.\n- For $\\{4,5\\}$: Use the group assignment for $(Z_2, A, 0)$. This costs $1$ PA entry.\n- For $\\{3\\}$: A per-resource assignment is necessary. This costs $1$ PA entry. (Using group rule for $(Z_1, B, 0)$ is equivalent in cost).\n- For $\\{7\\}$: A group assignment is forbidden. A per-resource assignment is required. This costs $1$ PA entry.\n- For $\\{9\\}$: A per-resource assignment is necessary. This costs $1$ PA entry. (Using group rule for $(Z_3, B, 0)$ is equivalent in cost).\n\nSumming these up, the minimum number of entries in $\\Delta PA$ is $1+1+1+1+1=5$.\nThus, $|\\Delta PA| = 5$.\n\nNext, we determine the minimal set of user assignments, $\\Delta UA$.\nWe need to assign users to role $r_{\\mathrm{new}}$ such that for every PLC $i \\in S$, there is at least one assigned user $u$ who satisfies the subject predicate $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{sub}}(u,i)$.\nFirst, we identify the eligible users from the set $U=\\{u_1, \\dots, u_8\\}$.\n- Users $u_4$ and $u_8$ have a conflicting role \"OpsEngineer\" and cannot be assigned to $r_{\\mathrm{new}}$.\n- User $u_3$ has clearance $c(u_3)=3$, which is less than the required $4$. So, $u_3$ is ineligible.\n- User $u_7$ has clearance $c(u_7)=2$, also less than $4$. So, $u_7$ is ineligible.\nThe set of eligible users is $\\{u_1, u_2, u_5, u_6\\}$. Their attributes relevant for $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{sub}}$ are:\n- $u_1$: $c=4$, $\\mathrm{cert}=\\{Z_1, Z_2\\}$. Can access PLCs in zones $Z_1$ and $Z_2$.\n- $u_2$: $c=4$, $\\mathrm{cert}=\\{Z_3\\}$. Can access PLCs in zone $Z_3$.\n- $u_5$: $c=4$, $\\mathrm{cert}=\\{Z_2\\}$. Can access PLCs in zone $Z_2$.\n- $u_6$: $c=4$, $\\mathrm{cert}=\\{Z_1\\}$. Can access PLCs in zone $Z_1$.\n\nThe PLCs in $S$ are located in the following zones:\n- Zone $Z_1$: PLCs $\\{1,2,3\\}$.\n- Zone $Z_2$: PLCs $\\{4,5\\}$.\n- Zone $Z_3$: PLCs $\\{7,9\\}$.\nTo enable upgrades on all PLCs in $S$, we need to assign a set of users whose combined zone certifications cover $\\{Z_1, Z_2, Z_3\\}$. This is a classic set cover problem. We want to find the minimum number of users to cover these three zones.\n\n- To cover zone $Z_3$, we must select user $u_2$, as no other eligible user is certified for $Z_3$. So, $(u_2, r_{\\mathrm{new}}) \\in \\Delta UA$.\n- With $u_2$ selected, we still need to cover zones $\\{Z_1, Z_2\\}$. We can do this by selecting user $u_1$, who is certified for both $\\{Z_1, Z_2\\}$. This adds $(u_1, r_{\\mathrm{new}})$ to $\\Delta UA$. The total number of users is $2$.\n- Alternatively, we could cover $\\{Z_1, Z_2\\}$ by selecting user $u_6$ (for $Z_1$) and user $u_5$ (for $Z_2$). This would require two additional users, for a total of $1+2=3$ users.\nThe minimal choice is to select users $\\{u_1, u_2\\}$, which covers all required zones.\nTherefore, the minimal set of user-role assignments is $\\Delta UA = \\{(u_1, r_{\\mathrm{new}}), (u_2, r_{\\mathrm{new}})\\}$.\nThe cardinality is $|\\Delta UA| = 2$.\n\nThe \"no others\" constraint is guaranteed because our construction of $\\Delta PA$ ensures that permissions for $r_{\\mathrm{new}}$ exist only for PLCs in $S$. Therefore, even if a user has the appropriate clearance and certification for a PLC outside $S$, say PLC $8$, the request will be denied because there is no corresponding entry in $PA$ for $(\\text{fw\\_upgrade}, 8)$ and role $r_{\\mathrm{new}}$.\n\nThe final result is the pair of cardinalities $(|\\Delta UA|, |\\Delta PA|)$.\n$|\\Delta UA| = 2$.\n$|\\Delta PA| = 5$.",

This exercise () tackles this challenge head-on, asking you to design a robust ABAC policy that can tolerate measurement uncertainty without compromising safety. By deriving a hysteresis band based on a worst-case error analysis, you will learn a practical technique for making access control decisions both stable and provably safe in the face of imperfect physical data.",

            "problem": "An industrial robotic assembly cell within a cyber-physical production system integrates a Digital Twin model to continuously evaluate contextual safety before executing high-power motions. Access decisions combine Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC): a user must have the appropriate role, and a context-derived risk index must certify safety. The ABAC component evaluates a dimensionless context risk index $R(c)$ computed from a real-valued attribute vector $c \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ containing: vibration magnitude $c_{1}$, workspace clearance $c_{2}$, and joint torque load $c_{3}$. The Digital Twin computes the risk index using the linear model $R(c) = w^{\\top} c$ with weights $w = (0.4,\\,-0.2,\\,0.7)$, where higher vibration and torque increase risk and greater clearance reduces risk. The safety requirement is expressed by a dimensionless threshold $r_{\\text{safe}} = 1.8$: an action may proceed only when the true risk $R(c)$ does not exceed $r_{\\text{safe}}$.\n\nHowever, the measured attributes $\\hat{c}$ are corrupted by bounded sensor error $e$ satisfying the known guarantee $\\|e\\|_{\\infty} \\leq \\epsilon$ with $\\epsilon = 0.03$ (each attribute may deviate by at most $0.03$ from its true value), and $\\hat{c} = c + e$. To tolerate small fluctuations while preventing unsafe actions under worst-case measurement error, you are asked to design a robust hysteresis band for ABAC decisions using two thresholds:\n- An “allow” threshold $\\tau_{\\text{allow}}$ such that if $R(\\hat{c}) \\leq \\tau_{\\text{allow}}$, then it is guaranteed that $R(c) \\leq r_{\\text{safe}}$.\n- A “deny” threshold $\\tau_{\\text{deny}}$ such that if $R(\\hat{c}) \\geq \\tau_{\\text{deny}}$, then it is guaranteed that $R(c) \\geq r_{\\text{safe}}$.\n\nWithin this band, the system defers the decision and requests additional evidence or stabilization. Start from fundamental definitions of norms and risk aggregation, and derive a conservative worst-case bound on $|R(\\hat{c}) - R(c)|$ under $\\|e\\|_{\\infty} \\leq \\epsilon$. Then, using this bound and the given $w$, $\\epsilon$, and $r_{\\text{safe}}$, compute the exact numerical values of $\\tau_{\\text{allow}}$ and $\\tau_{\\text{deny}}$. Express both thresholds as dimensionless values. No rounding is required, and the final answer must be the pair of thresholds as a single row matrix.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the design of a robust hysteresis band for an Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) system by determining an \"allow\" threshold $\\tau_{\\text{allow}}$ and a \"deny\" threshold $\\tau_{\\text{deny}}$. This is to be done based on a linear risk model, a safety threshold, and a known bound on sensor measurement error.\n\nThe first step is to quantify the maximum possible deviation between the true risk index $R(c)$ and the risk index computed from measured attributes, $R(\\hat{c})$.\n\nThe true risk is given by the linear model $R(c) = w^{\\top} c$, where $c \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is the vector of true attribute values and $w \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is the weight vector.\nThe measured attributes are $\\hat{c} = c + e$, where $e \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ is the sensor error vector.\nThe risk computed from measured attributes is thus:\n$$R(\\hat{c}) = w^{\\top} \\hat{c} = w^{\\top} (c + e) = w^{\\top} c + w^{\\top} e = R(c) + w^{\\top} e$$\nThe difference between the measured risk and the true risk is therefore $\\Delta R = R(\\hat{c}) - R(c) = w^{\\top} e$.\n\nWe need to find the worst-case (maximum absolute) value of this difference, denoted $\\Delta R_{\\max}$. The error vector $e$ is constrained by its infinity norm, $\\|e\\|_{\\infty} \\leq \\epsilon$, which means that for each component $e_i$ of the vector $e$, we have $|e_i| \\leq \\epsilon$.\n\nThe absolute value of the risk difference is $|w^{\\top} e| = |\\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i e_i|$.\nUsing the triangle inequality, we can bound this expression:\n$$|\\sum_{i=1}^{3} w_i e_i| \\leq \\sum_{i=1}^{3} |w_i e_i| = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} |w_i| |e_i|$$\nSince we know that $|e_i| \\leq \\epsilon$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$, we can further bound the sum:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{3} |w_i| |e_i| \\leq \\sum_{i=1}^{3} |w_i| \\epsilon = \\epsilon \\sum_{i=1}^{3} |w_i|$$\nThe sum $\\sum_{i=1}^{3} |w_i|$ is the definition of the $L_1$-norm of the weight vector $w$, denoted $\\|w\\|_1$. This result is a specific application of Hölder's inequality, which states that $|x^{\\top}y| \\leq \\|x\\|_p \\|y\\|_q$ for conjugate exponents $p, q$. Here we use $p=1$ and $q=\\infty$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible absolute difference between the measured and true risk is:\n$$\\Delta R_{\\max} = \\sup_{\\|e\\|_{\\infty} \\leq \\epsilon} |w^{\\top} e| = \\epsilon \\|w\\|_1$$\nThis bound is tight, as it can be achieved by choosing an error vector $e$ such that $e_i = \\epsilon \\cdot \\text{sgn}(w_i)$ for each $i$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $\\Delta R_{\\max}$.\nThe given weight vector is $w = (0.4, -0.2, 0.7)$. Its $L_1$-norm is:\n$$\\|w\\|_1 = |0.4| + |-0.2| + |0.7| = 0.4 + 0.2 + 0.7 = 1.3$$\nThe given error bound is $\\epsilon = 0.03$.\nThe maximum risk deviation is:\n$$\\Delta R_{\\max} = \\epsilon \\|w\\|_1 = 0.03 \\times 1.3 = 0.039$$\nSo, we have the inequality $|R(c) - R(\\hat{c})| \\leq 0.039$, which is equivalent to:\n$$R(\\hat{c}) - 0.039 \\leq R(c) \\leq R(\\hat{c}) + 0.039$$\n\nNext, we derive the thresholds $\\tau_{\\text{allow}}$ and $\\tau_{\\text{deny}}$. The safety requirement is $R(c) \\leq r_{\\text{safe}}$, where $r_{\\text{safe}} = 1.8$.\n\nFor the \"allow\" threshold $\\tau_{\\text{allow}}$, the condition is: if $R(\\hat{c}) \\leq \\tau_{\\text{allow}}$, then it is guaranteed that $R(c) \\leq r_{\\text{safe}}$.\nTo guarantee that the true risk $R(c)$ does not exceed $r_{\\text{safe}}$, we must ensure that its maximum possible value is less than or equal to $r_{\\text{safe}}$. From the inequality above, the maximum possible value for $R(c)$ given a measurement $\\hat{c}$ is $R(\\hat{c}) + \\Delta R_{\\max}$.\nThus, we must enforce the condition:\n$$R(\\hat{c}) + \\Delta R_{\\max} \\leq r_{\\text{safe}}$$\nThis is equivalent to $R(\\hat{c}) \\leq r_{\\text{safe}} - \\Delta R_{\\max}$.\nTo make the \"allow\" region as large as possible, we set the threshold to its maximum permissible value:\n$$\\tau_{\\text{allow}} = r_{\\text{safe}} - \\Delta R_{\\max}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\\tau_{\\text{allow}} = 1.8 - 0.039 = 1.761$$\n\nFor the \"deny\" threshold $\\tau_{\\text{deny}}$, the condition is: if $R(\\hat{c}) \\geq \\tau_{\\text{deny}}$, then it is guaranteed that $R(c) \\geq r_{\\text{safe}}$.\nTo guarantee that the true risk $R(c)$ is at least $r_{\\text{safe}}$, we must ensure that its minimum possible value is greater than or equal to $r_{\\text{safe}}$. From the inequality above, the minimum possible value for $R(c)$ given a measurement $\\hat{c}$ is $R(\\hat{c}) - \\Delta R_{\\max}$.\nThus, we must enforce the condition:\n$$R(\\hat{c}) - \\Delta R_{\\max} \\geq r_{\\text{safe}}$$\nThis is equivalent to $R(\\hat{c}) \\geq r_{\\text{safe}} + \\Delta R_{\\max}$.\nTo make the \"deny\" region trigger only when necessary (i.e., to make the hysteresis band as narrow as possible), we set the threshold to its minimum permissible value:\n$$\\tau_{\\text{deny}} = r_{\\text{safe}} + \\Delta R_{\\max}$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\\tau_{\\text{deny}} = 1.8 + 0.039 = 1.839$$\n\nThe derived thresholds are $\\tau_{\\text{allow}} = 1.761$ and $\\tau_{\\text{deny}} = 1.839$. Any measured risk $R(\\hat{c})$ in the interval $(1.761, 1.839)$ falls within the hysteresis band, where a decision is deferred.",
