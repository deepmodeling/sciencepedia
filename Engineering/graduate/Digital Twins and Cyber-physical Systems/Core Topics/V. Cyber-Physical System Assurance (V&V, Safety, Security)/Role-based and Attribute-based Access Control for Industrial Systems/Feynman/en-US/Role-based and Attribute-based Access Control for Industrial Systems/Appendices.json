            "problem": "In a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) for a chemical process line and its Digital Twin (DT), access to the remote valve override action is mediated by a hybrid Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) layer. RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) determines coarse eligibility by role, and ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control) refines the decision using attributes of the subject, object, and environment. A Policy Decision Point (PDP) evaluates a fixed set of sub-policies for each request and returns a single decision in the set $\\{\\mathsf{Permit}, \\mathsf{Deny}, \\mathsf{NotApplicable}, \\mathsf{Indeterminate}\\}$. Consider a contractor whose attributes cause the following sub-policy outcomes for a request to issue a remote valve override on a live line: clearance validation $\\mathsf{Deny}$ because the contractor’s clearance expired yesterday, training currency $\\mathsf{Permit}$ because the contractor passed the required module this week, supervisor attestation $\\mathsf{Indeterminate}$ because the attestation service is unreachable, and environment risk policy $\\mathsf{NotApplicable}$ because the risk model is disabled for maintenance. The organization mandates that both the Digital Twin and the physical controller enforce the same combined decision.\n\nYou are tasked to choose a policy-combining algorithm for the PDP such that the combined decision satisfies the following fundamental safety requirements grounded in established security design principles and safety engineering:\n\n- Fail-safe default: in the absence of sufficient evidence to permit, return $\\mathsf{Deny}$.\n- Safety monotonicity: adding any safety-negative evidence (for example, expired clearance) or uncertainty (for example, evaluation fault) must not make the decision less safe; informally, additional negative or uncertain information cannot flip a $\\mathsf{Deny}$ to $\\mathsf{Permit}$.\n- Determinism under conflict: for any multiset of sub-policy decisions, including conflicting outcomes such as simultaneous $\\mathsf{Permit}$ and $\\mathsf{Deny}$, the result is uniquely determined and biased toward safety.\n\nAssume the combining operator is applied over a multiset of decisions and must be deployable distributively (hence must be insensitive to evaluation order and grouping). Which of the following combining algorithms best satisfies the above requirements for this CPS and DT, given the contractor’s situation?\n\nA. Conservative deny-overrides with default deny: define $F$ on a multiset $M \\subseteq \\{\\mathsf{Permit}, \\mathsf{Deny}, \\mathsf{NotApplicable}, \\mathsf{Indeterminate}\\}$ by\n$$\nF(M)=\n\\begin{cases}\n\\mathsf{Deny},  \\text{if } \\exists d\\in M \\text{ with } d=\\mathsf{Deny},\\\\\n\\mathsf{Deny},  \\text{else if } \\exists d\\in M \\text{ with } d=\\mathsf{Indeterminate},\\\\\n\\mathsf{Permit},  \\text{else if } \\exists d\\in M \\text{ with } d=\\mathsf{Permit},\\\\\n\\mathsf{Deny},  \\text{else}~(\\text{that is, all } d=\\mathsf{NotApplicable}).\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nB. Permit-overrides with optimistic default: return $\\mathsf{Permit}$ if any sub-policy returns $\\mathsf{Permit}$; return $\\mathsf{Deny}$ only if all sub-policies return $\\mathsf{Deny}$; treat $\\mathsf{Indeterminate}$ as $\\mathsf{NotApplicable}$.\n\nC. First-applicable in fixed priority order: evaluate sub-policies in the fixed order training currency, clearance validation, supervisor attestation, environment risk policy; return the first result that is not $\\mathsf{NotApplicable}$.\n\nD. Weighted voting aggregator: map $\\mathsf{Permit}\\mapsto +1$, $\\mathsf{Deny}\\mapsto -1$, $\\mathsf{NotApplicable}\\mapsto 0$, $\\mathsf{Indeterminate}\\mapsto -1$, sum the scores, and return $\\mathsf{Permit}$ if the sum is greater than $0$, else $\\mathsf{Deny}$.\n\nChoose the best option and justify your selection by appealing to the stated properties and the safety context of industrial cyber-physical systems and their digital twins.",
            "solution": "We begin from fundamental principles of access control for safety-critical systems. A PDP implements a decision function $D:\\mathcal{S}\\times \\mathcal{O}\\times \\mathcal{A}\\times \\mathcal{E}\\to \\{\\mathsf{Permit},\\mathsf{Deny},\\mathsf{NotApplicable},\\mathsf{Indeterminate}\\}$, where $\\mathcal{S}$, $\\mathcal{O}$, $\\mathcal{A}$, and $\\mathcal{E}$ denote subject, object, action, and environment attribute spaces, respectively. The function $D$ is realized by combining sub-policy outcomes. The design must honor two core security design principles: fail-safe defaults (deny by default) and least privilege, which in policy-combining terms induce the following constraints.\n\nDefine the decision set $\\mathcal{D}=\\{\\mathsf{Permit},\\mathsf{Deny},\\mathsf{NotApplicable},\\mathsf{Indeterminate}\\}$. For safety reasoning, introduce a safety preorder $\\preceq_s$ over $\\mathcal{D}$ that encodes that $\\mathsf{Deny}$ is safest, $\\mathsf{Indeterminate}$ is less safe than $\\mathsf{Deny}$ but safer than $\\mathsf{Permit}$ in a fail-safe design, and $\\mathsf{NotApplicable}$ contributes no evidence and must not elevate risk by itself. A conservative ordering that captures this is\n$$\n\\mathsf{Permit} \\;\\prec_s\\; \\mathsf{Indeterminate} \\;\\prec_s\\; \\mathsf{Deny},\n$$\nwith $\\mathsf{NotApplicable}$ treated as a neutral element that should neither force a downgrade nor upgrade and is eliminated prior to aggregation. Safety monotonicity requires that for any multiset $M$ of decisions and any extension $M' \\supseteq M$ formed by adding $\\mathsf{Deny}$ or $\\mathsf{Indeterminate}$, a combining function $F$ must satisfy\n$$\nF(M') \\succeq_s F(M).\n$$\nFail-safe default requires $F(\\varnothing)=\\mathsf{Deny}$, where $\\varnothing$ represents the case that all sub-policies are $\\mathsf{NotApplicable}$ or provide no evidence. Determinism and distributability require $F$ to be insensitive to order and grouping, that is, $F$ must be commutative, associative, and idempotent with respect to multiset union, so that distributed evaluations in the Digital Twin and physical controller consistently yield the same result even if policy fragments are combined in different orders.\n\nUnder these constraints, the combining operator must pick the most conservative outcome present in the multiset after discarding $\\mathsf{NotApplicable}$. Moreover, in a safety-critical CPS, uncertainty must be treated as risk, hence $\\mathsf{Indeterminate}$ must be collapsed to $\\mathsf{Deny}$ to avoid unsafe permits in the presence of evaluation faults. Formally, this yields a conservative deny-overrides with default deny rule: return $\\mathsf{Deny}$ if $\\mathsf{Deny}$ or $\\mathsf{Indeterminate}$ appears; else return $\\mathsf{Permit}$ if any $\\mathsf{Permit}$ appears; otherwise return $\\mathsf{Deny}$. This operator depends only on the presence of categories, not on their order, and therefore is associative, commutative, and idempotent. It also satisfies safety monotonicity, because adding $\\mathsf{Deny}$ or $\\mathsf{Indeterminate}$ cannot decrease safety in the ordering $\\preceq_s$.\n\nInstantiating the contractor scenario, the multiset of outcomes is $M=\\{\\mathsf{Deny},\\mathsf{Permit},\\mathsf{Indeterminate},\\mathsf{NotApplicable}\\}$. A conservative deny-overrides with default deny returns $\\mathsf{Deny}$, which prevents a hazardous override action when clearance is expired and supervisory attestation is uncertain.\n\nWe now analyze each option against the stated properties.\n\nOption A: Conservative deny-overrides with default deny.\n- Formal definition: $F(M)=\\mathsf{Deny}$ if $M$ contains $\\mathsf{Deny}$ or $\\mathsf{Indeterminate}$; else $F(M)=\\mathsf{Permit}$ if $M$ contains $\\mathsf{Permit}$; else $F(M)=\\mathsf{Deny}$.\n- Fail-safe default: Satisfied, since $F(\\varnothing)=\\mathsf{Deny}$ and $\\mathsf{NotApplicable}$ does not produce $\\mathsf{Permit}$.\n- Safety monotonicity: Satisfied, because adding $\\mathsf{Deny}$ or $\\mathsf{Indeterminate}$ forces or preserves $\\mathsf{Deny}$; adding $\\mathsf{Permit}$ cannot override an existing $\\mathsf{Deny}$ or $\\mathsf{Indeterminate}$.\n- Determinism and distributability: Satisfied, since the outcome depends only on the presence of categories, not on order; equivalently, $F$ is associative, commutative, and idempotent over multiset union.\n- Application to the scenario: Returns $\\mathsf{Deny}$ given the presence of $\\mathsf{Deny}$ and $\\mathsf{Indeterminate}$, aligning with safety.\nVerdict: Correct.\n\nOption B: Permit-overrides with optimistic default; treat $\\mathsf{Indeterminate}$ as $\\mathsf{NotApplicable}$.\n- Fail-safe default: Violated in general, because a single $\\mathsf{Permit}$ yields $\\mathsf{Permit}$ even if other policies are $\\mathsf{NotApplicable}$.\n- Safety monotonicity: Violated, as adding a $\\mathsf{Permit}$ to a multiset containing $\\mathsf{Deny}$ can flip the decision to $\\mathsf{Permit}$, decreasing safety. In the contractor scenario, the presence of $\\mathsf{Permit}$ and $\\mathsf{Deny}$ would produce $\\mathsf{Permit}$, which is unsafe.\n- Determinism: The operator is deterministic but unsafe.\nVerdict: Incorrect.\n\nOption C: First-applicable in fixed priority order.\n- Fail-safe default: Not guaranteed; if the first policy in the order returns $\\mathsf{Permit}$, later $\\mathsf{Deny}$ is ignored.\n- Safety monotonicity: Violated, because the decision may change solely by reordering policies, not by changing evidence, and a later $\\mathsf{Deny}$ cannot override an earlier $\\mathsf{Permit}$. This allows a less safe result in the presence of negative evidence.\n- Determinism and distributability: Determinism depends on a global order; distributability is poor because distributed fragments may disagree about evaluation order, violating the requirement that the DT and controller align.\n- Application to the scenario: With training first, returns $\\mathsf{Permit}$ despite expired clearance, which is unsafe.\nVerdict: Incorrect.\n\nOption D: Weighted voting aggregator with $\\mathsf{Permit}\\mapsto +1$, $\\mathsf{Deny}\\mapsto -1$, $\\mathsf{NotApplicable}\\mapsto 0$, $\\mathsf{Indeterminate}\\mapsto -1$, permit if sum $0$ else deny.\n- Fail-safe default: If all are $\\mathsf{NotApplicable}$ the sum is $0$, yielding $\\mathsf{Deny}$, which aligns with default deny, but only due to a chosen threshold; alternative thresholds would break this property, and even with this threshold, safety can be violated in other compositions.\n- Safety monotonicity: Violated, as $\\mathsf{Permit}$ votes can numerically outweigh a single $\\mathsf{Deny}$, allowing $\\mathsf{Permit}$ despite negative evidence. For example, two $\\mathsf{Permit}$ and one $\\mathsf{Deny}$ sum to $+1$ and yield $\\mathsf{Permit}$, which contradicts conservative safety. Moreover, associativity holds for numeric sum, but the mapping and thresholding do not enforce that any $\\mathsf{Deny}$ or $\\mathsf{Indeterminate}$ is absorbing.\n- Determinism: Deterministic given fixed weights, but fails the core safety property.\n- Application to the scenario: The multiset maps to scores $-1$ for $\\mathsf{Deny}$, $+1$ for $\\mathsf{Permit}$, $-1$ for $\\mathsf{Indeterminate}$, and $0$ for $\\mathsf{NotApplicable}$; the sum is $-1$, hence $\\mathsf{Deny}$ in this specific case, but the method would permit in other hazardous compositions, violating safety monotonicity as a design principle.\nVerdict: Incorrect.\n\nBy derivation from fail-safe defaults, safety monotonicity, and distributability, only the conservative deny-overrides with default deny operator in Option A meets the requirements and yields a deterministic $\\mathsf{Deny}$ for the contractor’s conflicting attributes, protecting both the Digital Twin and the physical process from unsafe overrides during uncertainty and expired clearances.",

Encoding the ABAC Policy into Datalog Rules**\n\nLet $U$ be a user variable, $A$ be an action variable, and $R$ be a resource variable. The main access control decision is captured by the predicate $\\text{permit}(U, A, R)$, which is true if and only if all seven policy conditions are met. We define this with a top-level Horn clause that relies on seven intermediate predicates, each corresponding to one policy requirement.\n\nThe main rule is:\n$$ \\text{permit}(U, A, R) \\;:-\\; \\text{check\\_rbac}(U, A), \\text{check\\_training}(U, R), \\text{check\\_clearance}(U, R), \\text{check\\_dt\\_state}(R), \\text{check\\_risk}(A, R), \\text{check\\_zone}(U, R), \\text{check\\_sod}(U, R). $$\n\nThe seven intermediate predicates are defined by the following rules:\n\n1.  **RBAC gate**: The user $U$ must have a role that is authorized for the action $A$.\n    $$ \\text{check\\_rbac}(U, A) \\;:-\\; \\text{has\\_role}(U, \\text{Role}), \\text{role\\_can}(\\text{Role}, A). $$\n\n2.  **Training certification**: The user $U$ must be trained for the specific type of the resource $R$.\n    $$ \\text{check\\_training}(U, R) \\;:-\\; \\text{trained\\_for}(U, \\text{Type}), \\text{res\\_type}(R, \\text{Type}). $$\n\n3.  **Clearance dominance**: The user's clearance level $C_{\\text{level}}$ must be greater than or equal to the resource's criticality level $R_{\\text{level}}$.

Thus, $\\text{check\\_dt\\_state}(\\text{PLC7\\_23})$ is **true**.\n\n*   **Derivation of $\\text{check\\_risk}(\\text{reconfigure}, \\text{PLC7\\_23})$:**\n    The rule is $\\text{check\\_risk}(A, R) \\;:-\\; \\text{risk}(R, R_{\\text{risk}}), \\text{threshold}(A, A_{\\text{thresh}}), \\text{leq}(R_{\\text{risk}}, A_{\\text{thresh}})$.\n    From facts: $\\text{risk}(\\text{PLC7\\_23}, \\text{med})$ gives $R_{\\text{risk}} = \\text{med}$.\n    From facts: $\\text{threshold}(\\text{reconfigure}, \\text{med})$ gives $A_{\\text{thresh}} = \\text{med}$.\n    The third condition is to check if $\\text{leq}(\\text{med}, \\text{med})$ is true. This is given as a fact.\n    All conditions are met. Thus, $\\text{check\\_risk}(\\text{reconfigure}, \\text{PLC7\\_23})$ is **true**.\n\n*   **Derivation of $\\text{check\\_zone}(u_A, \\text{PLC7\\_23})$:**\n    The rule is $\\text{check\\_zone}(U, R) \\;:-\\; \\text{req\\_zone}(U, Z), \\text{res\\_zone}(R, Z)$.\n    With $U=u_A$ and $R=\\text{PLC7\\_23}$, we need a common zone $Z$.\n    From facts: $\\text{req\\_zone}(u_A, \\text{plant\\_net})$. Let $Z = \\text{plant\\_net}$.\n    From facts: $\\text{res\\_zone}(\\text{PLC7\\_23}, \\text{plant\\_net})$.\n    Both refer to the same zone. Thus, $\\text{check\\_zone}(u_A, \\text{PLC7\\_23})$ is **true**.\n\n*   **Derivation of $\\text{check\\_sod}(u_A, \\text{PLC7\\_23})$:**\n    The rule is $\\text{check\\_sod}(U, R) \\;:-\\; \\text{last\\_actor}(R, \\text{LastU}), \\text{distinct}(U, \\text{LastU})$.\n    With $U=u_A$ and $R=\\text{PLC7\\_23}$:\n    From facts: $\\text{last\\_actor}(\\text{PLC7\\_23}, u_B)$ gives $\\text{LastU} = u_B$.\n    The second condition is to check if $\\text{distinct}(u_A, u_B)$ is true. This is given as a fact.\n    Both conditions are met. Thus, $\\text{check\\_sod}(u_A, \\text{PLC7\\_23})$ is **true**.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe main rule is instantiated as:\n$$ \\text{permit}(u_A, \\text{reconfigure}, \\text{PLC7\\_23}) \\;:-\\; \\text{check\\_rbac}(\\dots), \\text{check\\_training}(\\dots), \\dots, \\text{check\\_sod}(\\dots). $$\nAs demonstrated, all seven predicates in the body of the rule have been proven to be true based on the provided facts. In the least fixed-point semantics of Datalog, since all antecedents of a rule are true, the consequent is also true. Therefore, the predicate $\\text{permit}(u_A, \\text{reconfigure}, \\text{PLC7\\_23})$ is derived to be true.\n\nThe problem requires the final decision to be expressed as a number, with $1$ for permit and $0$ for deny.

The ABAC policy enforces the following subject and resource predicates at evaluation time:\n- Subject predicate requires clearance and zone certification: for user $u$, let $c(u) \\in \\mathbb{N}$ denote clearance and $\\mathrm{cert}(u) \\subseteq \\{Z_1,Z_2,Z_3\\}$ denote zone certifications; the subject-side predicate is\n$$\n\\Phi_{\\mathrm{sub}}(u,i) \\equiv \\big(c(u) \\geq 4\\big) \\land \\big(Z(i) \\in \\mathrm{cert}(u)\\big).\n$$\n- Resource-side predicate language permitted for permissions associated with $r_{\\mathrm{new}}$ is restricted to conjunctions of equalities on $(Z,V,C)$ only; that is, a resource predicate is of the form\n$$\n\\Phi_{\\mathrm{res}}^{(Z^\\prime,V^\\prime)}(i) \\equiv \\big(Z(i)=Z^\\prime\\big) \\land \\big(V(i)=V^\\prime\\big) \\land \\big(C(i)=0\\big),\n$$\nand cannot mention the PLC identifier $i$ nor include disjunctions. However, RBAC permissions are defined at the granularity of a specific PLC identity $(\\text{fw\\_upgrade}, i)$, so a permission assignment to $r_{\\mathrm{new}}$ may either be:\n- a group assignment linking $r_{\\mathrm{new}}$ to all $(\\text{fw\\_upgrade}, i)$ such that $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{res}}^{(Z^\\prime,V^\\prime)}(i)$ holds, counted as one addition to $PA$, provided this does not grant access to any PLC outside $S$; or\n- a per-resource assignment linking $r_{\\mathrm{new}}$ to $(\\text{fw\\_upgrade}, i)$ for a specific $i$, counted as one addition to $PA$.\n\nSegregation of Duties (SoD) constraint: users already in the conflicting role \"OpsEngineer\" cannot be assigned to $r_{\\mathrm{new}}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the minimum number of user-role assignments, $|\\Delta UA|$, and permission-role assignments, $|\\Delta PA|$, needed to grant a new role $r_{\\mathrm{new}}$ the ability to perform firmware upgrades on a specific set of Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), $S=\\{1,2,3,4,5,7,9\\}$, and on no others.\n\nThe final decision rule for a request by user $u$ to perform action 'fw\\_upgrade' on PLC $i$ is that the following three conditions must be met simultaneously:\n1. The user $u$ is assigned the role $r_{\\mathrm{new}}$: $(u, r_{\\mathrm{new}}) \\in UA$.\n2. The permission $(\\text{fw\\_upgrade}, i)$ is assigned to the role $r_{\\mathrm{new}}$: $((\\text{fw\\_upgrade}, i), r_{\\mathrm{new}}) \\in PA$.\n3. The subject-side ABAC predicate is true: $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{sub}}(u,i) \\equiv (c(u) \\geq 4) \\land (Z(i) \\in \\mathrm{cert}(u))$.\n\nWe must find the minimal sets $\\Delta UA$ and $\\Delta PA$ to satisfy these conditions for all $i \\in S$ and for no $i \\notin S$.\n\nFirst, we determine the minimal set of permission assignments, $\\Delta PA$.\nPermissions for $r_{\\mathrm{new}}$ can be assigned to $PA$ in two ways:\na) A group assignment, based on a predicate $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{res}}^{(Z^\\prime,V^\\prime)}(i) \\equiv (Z(i)=Z^\\prime) \\land (V(i)=V^\\prime) \\land (C(i)=0)$. This is valid only if the set of all PLCs matching this predicate is a subset of $S$. Such a rule adds $1$ element to $\\Delta PA$.\nb) A per-resource assignment for a specific PLC $i$. This also adds $1$ element to $\\Delta PA$.\n\nThe goal is to cover all PLCs in $S=\\{1,2,3,4,5,7,9\\}$ with the minimum number of such assignments. Let's analyze the attributes of all $12$ PLCs:\n$s(1)=(Z_1,A,0)$, $s(2)=(Z_1,A,0)$, $s(3)=(Z_1,B,0)$, $s(4)=(Z_2,A,0)$, $s(5)=(Z_2,A,0)$, $s(6)=(Z_2,B,1)$, $s(7)=(Z_3,A,0)$, $s(8)=(Z_3,A,0)$, $s(9)=(Z_3,B,0)$, $s(10)=(Z_3,B,1)$, $s(11)=(Z_2,B,0)$, $s(12)=(Z_1,B,1)$.\nThe target set is $S=\\{1,2,3,4,5,7,9\\}$. The set of PLCs not in $S$ is $I \\setminus S = \\{6,8,10,11,12\\}$.\n\nThe resource predicate $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{res}}$ requires $C(i)=0$. This immediately filters out PLCs $6$, $10$, and $12$ from any group rule consideration, as they have $C(i)=1$. This is beneficial as they are all outside $S$. The remaining PLCs with $C(i)=0$ are $\\{1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9,11\\}$.\n\nWe can partition this set by their $(Z,V)$ attributes to identify potential group assignments:\n- Set $G_1 = \\{i \\mid Z(i)=Z_1, V(i)=A, C(i)=0\\} = \\{1,2\\}$. Since $G_1 \\subseteq S$, a group assignment for $(Z_1, A)$ is valid. This covers two PLCs, $\\{1,2\\}$, with $1$ PA entry.\n- Set $G_2 = \\{i \\mid Z(i)=Z_1, V(i)=B, C(i)=0\\} = \\{3\\}$. Since $G_2 \\subseteq S$, a group assignment for $(Z_1, B)$ is valid. It covers one PLC, $\\{3\\}$, with $1$ PA entry. A per-resource assignment would achieve the same.\n- Set $G_3 = \\{i \\mid Z(i)=Z_2, V(i)=A, C(i)=0\\} = \\{4,5\\}$. Since $G_3 \\subseteq S$, a group assignment for $(Z_2, A)$ is valid. It covers two PLCs, $\\{4,5\\}$, with $1$ PA entry.\n- Set $G_4 = \\{i \\mid Z(i)=Z_2, V(i)=B, C(i)=0\\} = \\{11\\}$. Since $11 \\notin S$, this group assignment is not useful for covering any PLC in $S$.\n- Set $G_5 = \\{i \\mid Z(i)=Z_3, V(i)=A, C(i)=0\\} = \\{7,8\\}$. Since $8 \\notin S$, this set is not a subset of $S$. Therefore, a group assignment for $(Z_3, A)$ is forbidden.\n- Set $G_6 = \\{i \\mid Z(i)=Z_3, V(i)=B, C(i)=0\\} = \\{9\\}$. Since $G_6 \\subseteq S$, a group assignment for $(Z_3, B)$ is valid. It covers one PLC, $\\{9\\}$, with $1$ PA entry.\n\nTo cover all PLCs in $S=\\{1,2,3,4,5,7,9\\}$ with minimal PA entries:\n- For $\\{1,2\\}$: Use the group assignment for $(Z_1, A, 0)$. This costs $1$ PA entry.\n- For $\\{4,5\\}$: Use the group assignment for $(Z_2, A, 0)$. This costs $1$ PA entry.\n- For $\\{3\\}$: A per-resource assignment is necessary. This costs $1$ PA entry. (Using group rule for $(Z_1, B, 0)$ is equivalent in cost).\n- For $\\{7\\}$: A group assignment is forbidden. A per-resource assignment is required. This costs $1$ PA entry.\n- For $\\{9\\}$: A per-resource assignment is necessary. This costs $1$ PA entry. (Using group rule for $(Z_3, B, 0)$ is equivalent in cost).\n\nSumming these up, the minimum number of entries in $\\Delta PA$ is $1+1+1+1+1=5$.\nThus, $|\\Delta PA| = 5$.\n\nNext, we determine the minimal set of user assignments, $\\Delta UA$.\nWe need to assign users to role $r_{\\mathrm{new}}$ such that for every PLC $i \\in S$, there is at least one assigned user $u$ who satisfies the subject predicate $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{sub}}(u,i)$.\nFirst, we identify the eligible users from the set $U=\\{u_1, \\dots, u_8\\}$.\n- Users $u_4$ and $u_8$ have a conflicting role \"OpsEngineer\" and cannot be assigned to $r_{\\mathrm{new}}$.\n- User $u_3$ has clearance $c(u_3)=3$, which is less than the required $4$. So, $u_3$ is ineligible.\n- User $u_7$ has clearance $c(u_7)=2$, also less than $4$. So, $u_7$ is ineligible.\nThe set of eligible users is $\\{u_1, u_2, u_5, u_6\\}$. Their attributes relevant for $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{sub}}$ are:\n- $u_1$: $c=4$, $\\mathrm{cert}=\\{Z_1, Z_2\\}$. Can access PLCs in zones $Z_1$ and $Z_2$.\n- $u_2$: $c=4$, $\\mathrm{cert}=\\{Z_3\\}$. Can access PLCs in zone $Z_3$.\n- $u_5$: $c=4$, $\\mathrm{cert}=\\{Z_2\\}$. Can access PLCs in zone $Z_2$.\n- $u_6$: $c=4$, $\\mathrm{cert}=\\{Z_1\\}$. Can access PLCs in zone $Z_1$.\n\nThe PLCs in $S$ are located in the following zones:\n- Zone $Z_1$: PLCs $\\{1,2,3\\}$.\n- Zone $Z_2$: PLCs $\\{4,5\\}$.\n- Zone $Z_3$: PLCs $\\{7,9\\}$.\nTo enable upgrades on all PLCs in $S$, we need to assign a set of users whose combined zone certifications cover $\\{Z_1, Z_2, Z_3\\}$. This is a classic set cover problem. We want to find the minimum number of users to cover these three zones.\n\n- To cover zone $Z_3$, we must select user $u_2$, as no other eligible user is certified for $Z_3$. So, $(u_2, r_{\\mathrm{new}}) \\in \\Delta UA$.\n- With $u_2$ selected, we still need to cover zones $\\{Z_1, Z_2\\}$. We can do this by selecting user $u_1$, who is certified for both $\\{Z_1, Z_2\\}$. This adds $(u_1, r_{\\mathrm{new}})$ to $\\Delta UA$. The total number of users is $2$.\n- Alternatively, we could cover $\\{Z_1, Z_2\\}$ by selecting user $u_6$ (for $Z_1$) and user $u_5$ (for $Z_2$). This would require two additional users, for a total of $1+2=3$ users.\nThe minimal choice is to select users $\\{u_1, u_2\\}$, which covers all required zones.\nTherefore, the minimal set of user-role assignments is $\\Delta UA = \\{(u_1, r_{\\mathrm{new}}), (u_2, r_{\\mathrm{new}})\\}$.\nThe cardinality is $|\\Delta UA| = 2$.\n\nThe \"no others\" constraint is guaranteed because our construction of $\\Delta PA$ ensures that permissions for $r_{\\mathrm{new}}$ exist only for PLCs in $S$. Therefore, even if a user has the appropriate clearance and certification for a PLC outside $S$, say PLC $8$, the request will be denied because there is no corresponding entry in $PA$ for $(\\text{fw\\_upgrade}, 8)$ and role $r_{\\mathrm{new}}$.\n\nThe final result is the pair of cardinalities $(|\\Delta UA|, |\\Delta PA|)$.\n$|\\Delta UA| = 2$.\n$|\\Delta PA| = 5$.",
