            "problem": "A safety-related subsystem in a cyber-physical process plant operates in high-demand, continuous mode. The subsystem is a one-out-of-one architecture and delivers a safety function continuously. Its failure behavior is represented by a constant dangerous failure rate and constant diagnostic coverage. A Digital Twin (DT) provides model-based diagnostics that detect a fraction of failures that would otherwise remain undetected by the built-in online diagnostics.\n\nAssume the following modeling foundations:\n1. Dangerous failures occur according to a homogeneous Poisson process with constant rate, leading to exponentially distributed interarrival times.\n2. The average frequency of dangerous failure per hour (PFH) in high-demand, continuous mode is defined as the average number of dangerous failure events of the safety function per unit time.\n3. Built-in online diagnostics detect a fraction of dangerous failures instantaneously during operation (converting them into detected dangerous failures that do not produce a hazardous undetected state). The Digital Twin detects an additional fraction of those dangerous failures that would otherwise remain undetected online.\n\nLet the total dangerous failure rate (before any diagnostics) of the subsystem be $\\,\\lambda_{D}\\,$ (units $\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$), the online diagnostic coverage be $\\,\\mathrm{DC}_{\\mathrm{on}}\\in[0,1]\\,$, and the Digital Twin incremental coverage on the previously undetected portion be $\\,C_{DT}\\in[0,1]\\,$. Assume that detections (either by the online diagnostics or by the Digital Twin) occur sufficiently promptly to prevent those detected failures from contributing to the dangerous undetected class.\n\nTasks:\n1. Starting only from the definitions of a homogeneous Poisson process and the definition of average frequency as the expected count per unit time, derive an expression for the average frequency of dangerous failure per hour, $\\,\\mathrm{PFH}\\,$, in terms of $\\,\\lambda_{D}\\,$, $\\,\\mathrm{DC}_{\\mathrm{on}}\\,$, and $\\,C_{DT}\\,$.

Do not include any units in the final boxed answer, but ensure that intermediate reasoning consistently uses correct units.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is critically evaluated and deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of reliability engineering and functional safety (specifically, concepts analogous to those in standards like IEC 61508). The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions, variables, and constraints, and is free from ambiguity, contradiction, or factual unsoundness. It requires a derivation from first principles, which is a standard academic exercise. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is divided into three tasks as requested.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of the expression for PFH**\n\nThe total dangerous failure rate of the subsystem is given as $\\lambda_{D}$. This rate represents the intensity of a homogeneous Poisson process for the occurrence of any dangerous failure, whether it is later detected or not.\n\nThe built-in online diagnostics have a coverage of $\\mathrm{DC}_{\\mathrm{on}}$. This means that a fraction $\\mathrm{DC}_{\\mathrm{on}}$ of the total dangerous failures are detected. The rate of these \"dangerous detected\" failures is:\n$$ \\lambda_{DD, \\mathrm{on}} = \\lambda_{D} \\cdot \\mathrm{DC}_{\\mathrm{on}} $$\nThe remaining failures are not detected by the online diagnostics. The rate of these \"dangerous undetected\" failures (from the perspective of the online diagnostics alone) is:\n$$ \\lambda_{DU, \\text{temp}} = \\lambda_{D} - \\lambda_{DD, \\mathrm{on}} = \\lambda_{D} - \\lambda_{D} \\cdot \\mathrm{DC}_{\\mathrm{on}} = \\lambda_{D} (1 - \\mathrm{DC}_{\\mathrm{on}}) $$\nThis constitutes the stream of failures upon which the Digital Twin (DT) can act.\n\nThe Digital Twin provides an incremental coverage of $C_{DT}$ on this previously undetected portion. This means the DT detects a fraction $C_{DT}$ of the failures that were missed by the online diagnostics. The rate of failures detected by the DT is:\n$$ \\lambda_{DD, \\mathrm{DT}} = \\lambda_{DU, \\text{temp}} \\cdot C_{DT} = \\lambda_{D} (1 - \\mathrm{DC}_{\\mathrm{on}}) C_{DT} $$\nThe final, residual rate of dangerous failures that are undetected by *either* system is denoted by $\\lambda_{DU}$. This is the rate of failures missed by the online diagnostics, minus the rate of those subsequently caught by the DT:\n$$ \\lambda_{DU} = \\lambda_{DU, \\text{temp}} - \\lambda_{DD, \\mathrm{DT}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above:\n$$ \\lambda_{DU} = \\lambda_{D} (1 - \\mathrm{DC}_{\\mathrm{on}}) - \\lambda_{D} (1 - \\mathrm{DC}_{\\mathrm{on}}) C_{DT} $$\nFactoring out the common term $\\lambda_{D} (1 - \\mathrm{DC}_{\\mathrm{on}})$ yields the final expression for the residual dangerous undetected failure rate:\n$$ \\lambda_{DU} = \\lambda_{D} (1 - \\mathrm{DC}_{\\mathrm{on}}) (1 - C_{DT}) $$\nThe problem defines the system as operating in a high-demand, continuous mode, where a dangerous failure leads to an immediate hazard. The Average Frequency of Dangerous Failure per Hour ($\\mathrm{PFH}$) is defined as the average number of such hazardous events per unit time. For a homogeneous Poisson process with a constant rate $\\lambda_{DU}$, the expected number of events in a time interval $t$ is $E[N(t)] = \\lambda_{DU} t$. The average frequency is this expected number divided by the time interval, which is simply the rate $\\lambda_{DU}$. Therefore, for a single, non-repairable component in continuous mode:\n$$ \\mathrm{PFH} = \\lambda_{DU} $$\nCombining these results gives the final derived expression for $\\mathrm{PFH}$:\n$$ \\mathrm{PFH} = \\lambda_{D} (1 - \\mathrm{DC}_{\\mathrm{on}}) (1 - C_{DT}) $$\n\n**Task 2: Numerical Computation of PFH**\n\nWe are given the following numerical values:\n- Total dangerous failure rate, $\\lambda_{D} = 3.2 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$\n- Online diagnostic coverage, $\\mathrm{DC}_{\\mathrm{on}} = 0.90$\n- Digital Twin incremental coverage, $C_{DT} = 0.60$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $\\mathrm{PFH}$:\n$$ \\mathrm{PFH} = (3.2 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}) \\cdot (1 - 0.90) \\cdot (1 - 0.60) $$\n$$ \\mathrm{PFH} = (3.2 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}) \\cdot (0.10) \\cdot (0.40) $$\n$$ \\mathrm{PFH} = (3.2 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1}) \\cdot 0.04 $$\n$$ \\mathrm{PFH} = 0.128 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1} $$\nTo express this in standard scientific notation and round to three significant figures, we write:\n$$ \\mathrm{PFH} = 1.28 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{h}^{-1} $$\nThe value $1.28 \\times 10^{-7}$ has three significant figures ($1$, $2$, and $8$), so no further rounding is needed.\n\n**Task 3: Applicability Conditions for the Approximation $\\mathrm{PFH} \\approx \\lambda_{DU}$**\n\nIn the context of the given problem, which assumes a homogeneous Poisson process for failures (implying constant failure rate and an exponential distribution of time-to-failure), the relationship $\\mathrm{PFH} = \\lambda_{DU}$ is an identity by definition for a non-repairable system in continuous mode. The PFH is the average rate of occurrence of dangerous undetected failures, which is exactly $\\lambda_{DU}$.\n\nHowever, the question frames this as an \"approximation\", which usually refers to the relationship between the failure rate and the *probability* of failure over a specific time interval. The average probability of failure per hour, also denoted PFH in some contexts, is the probability that at least one dangerous undetected failure occurs in a one-hour interval. For a Poisson process with rate $\\lambda_{DU}$, this probability is:\n$$ P(\\text{failure in 1 hour}) = 1 - P(\\text{no failure in 1 hour}) = 1 - \\frac{(\\lambda_{DU} \\cdot 1)^{0} \\exp(-\\lambda_{DU} \\cdot 1)}{0!} = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_{DU}) $$\nThe approximation $\\mathrm{PFH} \\approx \\lambda_{DU}$ arises from the Taylor series expansion of the exponential function for small arguments. The expansion is $\\exp(-x) = 1 - x + \\frac{x^2}{2!} - \\dots$. For small $x$, we can truncate after the linear term: $\\exp(-x) \\approx 1 - x$.\n\nSubstituting this approximation into the probability expression:\n$$ P(\\text{failure in 1 hour}) \\approx 1 - (1 - \\lambda_{DU}) = \\lambda_{DU} $$\nThis approximation is valid under the condition that the argument of the exponential function is much less than $1$. In this context, the applicability condition is that the dangerous undetected failure rate $\\lambda_{DU}$ (with units of $\\mathrm{h}^{-1}$) must be a very small number, i.e., $\\lambda_{DU} \\ll 1$.\n\nFor any system with a high safety integrity level, the dangerous failure rate $\\lambda_{DU}$ must be extremely low (e.g., for SIL 3, the target PFH is between $10^{-8}$ and $10^{-7} \\, \\mathrm{h}^{-1}$). For such small values of $\\lambda_{DU}$, the approximation is exceptionally accurate, and the difference between $1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_{DU})$ and $\\lambda_{DU}$ is negligible. For instance, using the value calculated in Task 2, $\\lambda_{DU} = 1.28 \\times 10^{-7}$. The error of the approximation is on the order of $\\lambda_{DU}^2/2 \\approx 8.19 \\times 10^{-15}$, which is insignificant. Thus, in high-demand, continuous mode, the approximation $\\mathrm{PFH} \\approx \\lambda_{DU}$ is valid whenever the system conforms to the requirements of any safety integrity level, as this inherently implies $\\lambda_{DU} \\ll 1$.",

The problem provides the $\\beta$-factor model for this configuration:\n    $$Q_S \\approx \\beta_s Q_s + (1 - \\beta_s) Q_s^{2}$$\n    where $Q_s$ is the unavailability of a single sensing channel and $\\beta_s$ is the Common Cause Failure (CCF) fraction.\n    First, we calculate $Q_s$ using the parameters $\\lambda_{s} = 2 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$ and $\\mu_{s} = \\frac{1}{8}\\,\\text{h}^{-1} = 0.125\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$:\n    $$Q_s = \\frac{\\lambda_s}{\\lambda_s + \\mu_s} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-6}}{2 \\times 10^{-6} + 0.125} = \\frac{2 \\times 10^{-6}}{0.125002} \\approx 1.5999744 \\times 10^{-5}$$\n    Now, we use this value with $\\beta_s = 0.05$ in the CCF formula:\n    $$Q_S \\approx (0.05)(1.5999744 \\times 10^{-5}) + (1 - 0.05)(1.5999744 \\times 10^{-5})^2$$\n    $$Q_S \\approx 7.999872 \\times 10^{-7} + (0.95)(2.5599181 \\times 10^{-10})$$\n    $$Q_S \\approx 7.999872 \\times 10^{-7} + 2.431922 \\times 10^{-10} \\approx 8.002304 \\times 10^{-7}$$\n\n3.  **Power Contactor Subsystem Unavailability ($Q_K$)**\n    This is also a dual-channel subsystem where a dangerous failure (failure to remove power) occurs if both contactors stick closed. This is also a 1-out-of-2 architecture from a safety perspective. The same $\\beta$-factor model applies:\n    $$Q_K \\approx \\beta_k Q_k + (1 - \\beta_k) Q_k^{2}$$\n    First, we calculate the single-contactor unavailability $Q_k$ with parameters $\\lambda_{k} = 3 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$ and $\\mu_{k} = \\frac{1}{12}\\,\\text{h}^{-1} \\approx 0.083333\\,\\text{h}^{-1}$:\n    $$Q_k = \\frac{\\lambda_k}{\\lambda_k + \\mu_k} = \\frac{3 \\times 10^{-6}}{3 \\times 10^{-6} + \\frac{1}{12}} = \\frac{3 \\times 10^{-6}}{0.083336333...} \\approx 3.5998704 \\times 10^{-5}$$\n    Now, we use this value with $\\beta_k = 0.02$ in the CCF formula:\n    $$Q_K \\approx (0.02)(3.5998704 \\times 10^{-5}) + (1 - 0.02)(3.5998704 \\times 10^{-5})^2$$\n    $$Q_K \\approx 7.1997408 \\times 10^{-7} + (0.98)(1.2959067 \\times 10^{-9})$$\n    $$Q_K \\approx 7.1997408 \\times 10^{-7} + 1.269988 \\times 10^{-9} \\approx 7.212440 \\times 10^{-7}$$\n\nThe closed-form expression for $P(\\mathcal{H})$ is:\n$$P(\\mathcal{H}) \\approx p_Z \\left( \\left[ \\beta_s \\frac{\\lambda_s}{\\lambda_s + \\mu_s} + (1-\\beta_s) \\left(\\frac{\\lambda_s}{\\lambda_s + \\mu_s}\\right)^2 \\right] + \\left[ \\frac{\\lambda_p}{\\lambda_p + \\mu_p} \\right] + \\left[ \\beta_k \\frac{\\lambda_k}{\\lambda_k + \\mu_k} + (1-\\beta_k) \\left(\\frac{\\lambda_k}{\\lambda_k + \\mu_k}\\right)^2 \\right] \\right)$$\n\nNow, we sum the subsystem unavailabilities to find the total system unavailability $Q_{\\text{sys}}$:\n$$Q_{\\text{sys}} \\approx Q_S + Q_P + Q_K$$\n$$Q_{\\text{sys}} \\approx (8.002304 \\times 10^{-7}) + (3.999984 \\times 10^{-6}) + (7.212440 \\times 10^{-7})$$\n$$Q_{\\text{sys}} \\approx (0.8002304 + 3.999984 + 0.7212440) \\times 10^{-6}$$\n$$Q_{\\text{sys}} \\approx 5.5214584 \\times 10^{-6}$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the top-event probability $P(\\mathcal{H})$ by multiplying the system unavailability by the probability of human presence, $p_Z = 0.02$:\n$$P(\\mathcal{H}) = p_Z Q_{\\text{sys}}$$\n$$P(\\mathcal{H}) \\approx (0.02) \\times (5.5214584 \\times 10^{-6})$$\n$$P(\\mathcal{H}) \\approx 1.10429168 \\times 10^{-7}$$\n\nRounding the result to three significant figures as requested:\n$$P(\\mathcal{H}) \\approx 1.10 \\times 10^{-7}$$\nThis value represents the probability, at an arbitrary instant in time, of finding the system in a hazardous state where the robot is capable of dangerous motion while a human is present in the collaborative zone.",
