This exercise provides a foundational look into the concept of metrological gain by exploring the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI), a key metric for the ultimate precision achievable in a measurement.

            "problem": "A digital twin of a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) integrates a collective-spin quantum sensor comprised of $N$ identical spin-$1/2$ particles used to track a dynamical rotation angle $\\phi$ induced by a weak, time-dependent magnetic field aligned with the $z$-axis. The parameter $\\phi$ is encoded by the unitary $U(\\phi)$ generated by the collective spin operator $J_z$, and the system is probed in the small-angle regime where linear-response analysis is valid.\n\nAssume the initial probe state is a spin-coherent state polarized along the $x$-axis. Then, consider replacing this probe with a pure, Gaussian spin-squeezed state that maintains a large mean spin along $x$, has its squeezed quadrature along $y$, and saturates the $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ minimum-uncertainty relation between the $y$ and $z$ collective spin components.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the metrological gain $G$ achieved by using a spin-squeezed state instead of a spin-coherent state for sensing a small rotation. This gain is defined as the ratio of the respective Quantum Fisher Informations (QFI).\n\nThe fundamental formula for the QFI, $F_Q$, for a pure probe state $|\\psi\\rangle$ under a unitary parameter encoding $U(\\phi) = \\exp(-i\\phi K)$, where $K$ is the generator of the transformation, is given by the variance of the generator in the state $|\\psi\\rangle$:\n$$F_Q = 4 (\\Delta K)^2_{|\\psi\\rangle} = 4 \\left( \\langle K^2 \\rangle - \\langle K \\rangle^2 \\right)$$\nIn the present problem, the rotation angle $\\phi$ is encoded via the unitary $U(\\phi)$ generated by the collective spin operator $J_z$. Thus, the generator is $K = J_z$. We can set the reduced Planck constant $\\hbar=1$, as is conventional in quantum information theory, noting that any dependence on $\\hbar$ would cancel in the final ratio $G$. The QFI for any pure probe state $|\\psi\\rangle$ is therefore:\n$$F_Q = 4 (\\Delta J_z)^2_{|\\psi\\rangle}$$\nThe problem thus reduces to calculating the variance of the $J_z$ operator for the two specified probe states. The system consists of $N$ spin-$1/2$ particles, resulting in a total spin quantum number $J = N/2$. The collective spin operators $J_x$, $J_y$, and $J_z$ obey the $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ commutation relations, specifically $[J_y, J_z] = i J_x$.\n\nFirst, we will find the QFI for the spin-coherent state (SCS), which we denote as $|\\psi_{SCS}\\rangle$. The problem states this is an SCS polarized along the $x$-axis. For such a state, the expectation values of the spin components are $\\langle J_x \\rangle = J = N/2$, $\\langle J_y \\rangle = 0$, and $\\langle J_z \\rangle = 0$. An SCS is a minimum uncertainty state, meaning it saturates the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for the orthogonal components. The general uncertainty relation for $J_y$ and $J_z$ is:\n$$(\\Delta J_y)^2 (\\Delta J_z)^2 \\ge \\frac{1}{4}|\\langle[J_y, J_z]\\rangle|^2 = \\frac{1}{4}|\\langle i J_x \\rangle|^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\langle J_x \\rangle^2$$\nFor an SCS, the quantum noise is distributed isotropically in the plane perpendicular to the mean spin direction. For an $x$-polarized SCS, this implies $(\\Delta J_y)^2 = (\\Delta J_z)^2$. Combining this with the saturation of the uncertainty relation, we get:\n$$(\\Delta J_z)^2 \\cdot (\\Delta J_z)^2 = (\\Delta J_z)^4 = \\frac{1}{4} \\langle J_x \\rangle^2$$\nTaking the square root and substituting the value of $\\langle J_x \\rangle = J = N/2$:\n$$(\\Delta J_z)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} |\\langle J_x \\rangle| = \\frac{1}{2} J = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{N}{2}\\right) = \\frac{N}{4}$$\nWe can now calculate the QFI for the SCS probe:\n$$F_{Q, SCS} = 4 (\\Delta J_z)^2_{|\\psi_{SCS}\\rangle} = 4 \\left( \\frac{N}{4} \\right) = N$$\nThis value, $N$, corresponds to the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL) for $N$ uncorrelated particles.\n\nSecond, we analyze the spin-squeezed state (SSS), denoted $|\\psi_{SSS}\\rangle$. This state is also characterized by a large mean spin along the $x$-axis, for which we can use the approximation $\\langle J_x \\rangle \\approx J = N/2$, which is highly accurate for large $N$. The problem specifies that this state saturates the $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ minimum-uncertainty relation for $J_y$ and $J_z$:\n$$(\\Delta J_y)^2 (\\Delta J_z)^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\langle J_x \\rangle^2$$\nOur goal is to find $(\\Delta J_z)^2$ to compute $F_{Q, SSS}$. From the minimum-uncertainty relation, we can express the anti-squeezed variance $(\\Delta J_z)^2$ as:\n$$(\\Delta J_z)^2 = \\frac{\\langle J_x \\rangle^2}{4 (\\Delta J_y)^2}$$\nThe problem provides the definition of the Wineland squeezing parameter, $\\xi^2$, for this state:\n$$\\xi^2 \\equiv \\frac{N (\\Delta J_y)^2}{|\\langle J_x \\rangle|^2}$$\nFor a state to be squeezed along the $y$-quadrature, its variance must be less than that of an SCS, i.e., $(\\Delta J_y)^2  N/4$, which corresponds to $\\xi^2  1$. We can rearrange the definition of $\\xi^2$ to express the squeezed variance $(\\Delta J_y)^2$:\n$$(\\Delta J_y)^2 = \\frac{\\xi^2 |\\langle J_x \\rangle|^2}{N}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression into our equation for $(\\Delta J_z)^2$:\n$$(\\Delta J_z)^2 = \\frac{\\langle J_x \\rangle^2}{4 \\left( \\frac{\\xi^2 |\\langle J_x \\rangle|^2}{N} \\right)} = \\frac{\\langle J_x \\rangle^2 N}{4 \\xi^2 |\\langle J_x \\rangle|^2} = \\frac{N}{4\\xi^2}$$\nThe QFI for the spin-squeezed state is therefore:\n$$F_{Q, SSS} = 4 (\\Delta J_z)^2_{|\\psi_{SSS}\\rangle} = 4 \\left( \\frac{N}{4\\xi^2} \\right) = \\frac{N}{\\xi^2}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the metrological gain $G$, which is defined as the ratio of the QFI for the SSS to that of the SCS:\n$$G = \\frac{F_{Q, SSS}}{F_{Q, SCS}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions we derived for $F_{Q, SSS}$ and $F_{Q, SCS}$:\n$$G = \\frac{N/\\xi^2}{N} = \\frac{1}{\\xi^2}$$\nThis expression for the gain $G$ depends only on the squeezing parameter $\\xi^2$, as required by the problem statement.",

The two interferometer output paths recombine as coherent probability amplitudes whose detected transition probability is determined by Born’s rule. Finite contrast arises from dephasing and loss mechanisms, reducing the visibility of the interference fringes below unity.\n\nStarting from the principle that the detected transition probability is proportional to the squared modulus of the coherent sum of two equal-magnitude complex amplitudes with relative phase $\\phi$, derive the functional form of the transition probability as a function of $\\phi$ when the interferometer has finite contrast. Explicitly introduce a contrast parameter $\\mathcal{C}$ with $0 \\leq \\mathcal{C} \\leq 1$ and assume equal path intensities and balanced detection so that the direct-current (DC) offset of the probability is symmetric about $1/2$.

Calculating the one-shot acceleration sensitivity $\\sigma_{a}$ using the provided numerical values.\n\nFirst, we derive the functional form of the transition probability $P(\\phi)$. An ideal two-path interferometer with equal beam-splitting would result in a probability that varies between $0$ and $1$. The probability of an atom transitioning to the second internal state after the $\\pi/2$–$\\pi$–$\\pi/2$ sequence is given by $P_{\\mathrm{ideal}}(\\phi) = \\sin^2(\\phi/2) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\cos\\phi)$, where $\\phi$ is the relative phase accumulated between the two interferometer paths. This form has maximum contrast, i.e., $\\mathcal{C}=1$.\n\nFinite contrast arises from decoherence and other experimental imperfections. We can model this by considering that a fraction of the atomic ensemble, equal to the contrast $\\mathcal{C}$, interferes perfectly, while the remaining fraction, $(1-\\mathcal{C})$, does not interfere and contributes a constant average probability. For a two-state system, this non-interfering portion contributes a transition probability of $1/2$. The total probability $P(\\phi)$ is the weighted sum of these two contributions:\n$$P(\\phi) = \\mathcal{C} \\cdot P_{\\mathrm{ideal}}(\\phi) + (1-\\mathcal{C}) \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $P_{\\mathrm{ideal}}(\\phi)$:\n$$P(\\phi) = \\mathcal{C} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\cos\\phi) \\right] + \\frac{1-\\mathcal{C}}{2} = \\frac{\\mathcal{C}}{2} - \\frac{\\mathcal{C}}{2}\\cos\\phi + \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\mathcal{C}}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{\\mathcal{C}}{2}\\cos\\phi$$\nThis can be written as:\n$$P(\\phi) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\mathcal{C}\\cos\\phi)$$\nLet us verify this form against the problem constraints.

This satisfies the condition that the DC offset is symmetric about $1/2$. The contrast is defined as $\\frac{P_{\\mathrm{max}} - P_{\\mathrm{min}}}{P_{\\mathrm{max}} + P_{\\mathrm{min}}} = \\frac{1/2(1+\\mathcal{C}) - 1/2(1-\\mathcal{C})}{1/2(1+\\mathcal{C}) + 1/2(1-\\mathcal{C})} = \\frac{\\mathcal{C}}{1} = \\mathcal{C}$, which is also consistent.

We use the chain rule:\n$$\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial a} = \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial \\phi} \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial a}$$\nWe first compute the derivative of $P$ with respect to $\\phi$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial \\phi} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\mathcal{C}\\cos\\phi) \\right] = -\\frac{\\mathcal{C}}{2}(-\\sin\\phi) = \\frac{\\mathcal{C}}{2}\\sin\\phi$$\nThe system operates at mid-fringe, where the phase is $\\phi = (2n+1)\\pi/2$ for some integer $n$. At this operating point, the sine function evaluates to:\n$$\\sin\\left((2n+1)\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = \\sin\\left(n\\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) = (-1)^n$$\nTherefore, the slope at the operating point is $\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial \\phi} = \\frac{\\mathcal{C}}{2}(-1)^n$. The magnitude of this slope is:\n$$\\left|\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial \\phi}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{\\mathcal{C}}{2}(-1)^n\\right| = \\frac{\\mathcal{C}}{2}$$\nNow, we can express the magnitude of the slope with respect to acceleration:\n$$\\left|\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial a}\\right| = \\left|\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial \\phi}\\right| \\left|\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial a}\\right| = \\frac{\\mathcal{C}}{2} \\left|\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial a}\\right|$$\n\nThird, we evaluate the one-shot acceleration sensitivity $\\sigma_{a}$.

Taking the derivative with respect to $a$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial a} = k_{\\mathrm{eff}} T^{2}$$\nSince $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and $T$ are positive quantities, $|\\partial \\phi / \\partial a| = k_{\\mathrm{eff}} T^{2}$. The expression for sensitivity becomes:\n$$\\sigma_{a} = \\frac{2\\sigma_{P}}{\\mathcal{C} k_{\\mathrm{eff}} T^{2}}$$\nWe are given $k_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 4\\pi / \\lambda$. Substituting this gives the final symbolic expression for $\\sigma_{a}$:\n$$\\sigma_{a} = \\frac{2\\sigma_{P}}{\\mathcal{C} \\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{\\lambda}\\right) T^{2}} = \\frac{2\\sigma_{P}\\lambda}{4\\pi\\mathcal{C}T^{2}} = \\frac{\\sigma_{P}\\lambda}{2\\pi\\mathcal{C}T^{2}}$$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values into this expression. The values must be in base SI units.\n- $\\sigma_{P} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-3}$\n- $\\lambda = 780\\ \\mathrm{nm} = 780 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- $\\mathcal{C} = 0.30$\n- $T = 50\\ \\mathrm{ms} = 50 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s} = 0.05\\ \\mathrm{s}$\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n$$\\sigma_{a} = \\frac{(2.0 \\times 10^{-3})(780 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m})}{2\\pi (0.30) (0.05\\ \\mathrm{s})^{2}}$$\n$$\\sigma_{a} = \\frac{1.56 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}}{2\\pi (0.30) (0.0025\\ \\mathrm{s}^{2})}$$\n$$\\sigma_{a} = \\frac{1.56 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}}{2\\pi (7.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{2})}$$\n$$\\sigma_{a} = \\frac{1.56 \\times 10^{-9}}{0.00471238...}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}$$\n$$\\sigma_{a} \\approx 3.31042 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get $3.31 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}$.",
