This problem of Byzantine fault tolerance is central to designing robust agent-based architectures for cyber-physical systems.

            "problem": "Consider a Digital Twin (DT) of a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) implementing an agent-based system architecture to estimate a scalar physical state at discrete time instants. There are $n$ agents that each submit a real-valued report $y_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}$ to a centralized DT aggregator. Exactly $f$ agents may be Byzantine, meaning they can produce arbitrary (potentially adversarial) values, while the remaining $n-f$ agents are honest but noisy. The plant state is $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and each honest agent $i$ reports a value $y_{i}$ satisfying $|y_{i} - x| \\leq \\Delta$ for a known bound $\\Delta > 0$. Communication is synchronous and authenticated, so the aggregator receives one report per agent per time step without spoofing or omission.\n\nAssume the aggregator selects a symmetric, permutation-invariant robust aggregation function on $\\mathbb{R}$, defined on odd sample sizes $n$, specifically the median: for the multiset of $n$ received values $\\{y_{1},\\dots,y_{n}\\}$, after sorting to obtain order statistics $y_{(1)} \\leq \\dots \\leq y_{(n)}$, the aggregator outputs $y_{(k)}$ with $k = (n+1)/2$. The DT must guarantee that the aggregate estimate $y_{(k)}$ lies within the convex hull of the honest reports, and hence within the interval $[x - \\Delta, x + \\Delta]$, regardless of the adversarial values.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definitions of order statistics and the requirement that an estimator remain within the convex hull of honest data to be robust against outliers, derive the minimum number of agents $n_{\\min}$ (as a function of $f$) required to guarantee that the median aggregation output remains in $[x - \\Delta, x + \\Delta]$ for every adversarial strategy. Your derivation must establish both necessity and sufficiency with respect to the bound on $n$ imposed by $f$, using only the given modeling assumptions and first principles of robustness for order statistics. Explicitly justify the choice of the median as a robust aggregation function in this setting by showing that it maintains the aggregate within the honest interval under the derived condition on $n$.\n\nProvide your final answer as a closed-form expression for $n_{\\min}$ in terms of $f$. No numerical rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the minimum total number of agents, $n_{\\min}$, needed to guarantee that the median of their reports remains within a bounded interval around a true state $x$, despite the presence of $f$ adversarial (Byzantine) agents. The derivation must establish both the necessity and sufficiency of the derived condition.\n\nLet $n$ be the total number of agents. The number $n$ is given to be an odd integer.\nLet $f$ be the number of Byzantine agents.\nThe number of honest agents is $n-f$.\nLet $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ be the true physical state.\nHonest agents provide reports $y_i$ such that $|y_i - x| \\leq \\Delta$, which means $y_i \\in [x - \\Delta, x + \\Delta]$.\nByzantine agents can provide any arbitrary report $y_i \\in \\mathbb{R}$.\nThe aggregator computes the median of the $n$ reports. Let the sorted reports (order statistics) be $y_{(1)} \\leq y_{(2)} \\leq \\dots \\leq y_{(n)}$. Since $n$ is odd, the median is the unique central element $y_{(k)}$, where the rank $k$ is given by $k = (n+1)/2$.\nThe guarantee we must enforce is that the median $y_{(k)}$ lies within the convex hull of the honest reports. On the real line, the convex hull of the set of honest reports $\\{y_i\\}_{i \\in H}$ is the interval $[\\min_{i \\in H} y_i, \\max_{i \\in H} y_i]$. Since all honest reports are within $[x - \\Delta, x + \\Delta]$, this guarantee implies $y_{(k)} \\in [x - \\Delta, x + \\Delta]$.\n\nWe will derive the condition on $n$ by proving its sufficiency and necessity.\n\n**1. Sufficiency**\n\nWe will show that the condition $n \\geq 2f+1$ is sufficient to guarantee that the median $y_{(k)}$ is contained within the convex hull of the honest reports. That is, if $n \\geq 2f+1$, then $\\min_{i \\in H} y_i \\leq y_{(k)} \\leq \\max_{i \\in H} y_i$ regardless of the values reported by the $f$ Byzantine agents. This analysis explicitly justifies the robustness of the median under this condition.\n\nWe proceed by contradiction.\n\nFirst, assume that the median is greater than the largest honest report: $y_{(k)} > \\max_{i \\in H} y_i$.\nIf this is true, then the median itself cannot be an honest report. Furthermore, all reports with a rank higher than or equal to $k$ must also be greater than any honest report. The reports with ranks from $k$ to $n$ are $y_{(k)}, y_{(k+1)}, \\dots, y_{(n)}$. The number of such reports is $n - k + 1 = n - \\frac{n+1}{2} + 1 = \\frac{2n - (n+1) + 2}{2} = \\frac{n+1}{2}$.\nSince all these $\\frac{n+1}{2}$ reports are greater than any honest report, they must all originate from Byzantine agents. Therefore, the number of Byzantine agents, $f$, must be at least this large:\n$$f \\geq \\frac{n+1}{2}$$\nRearranging this inequality, we get:\n$$2f \\geq n+1$$\n$$n \\leq 2f-1$$\nThis result, $n \\leq 2f-1$, contradicts our initial assumption that $n \\geq 2f+1$. Therefore, the median cannot be greater than the maximum honest value.\n\nSecond, assume that the median is smaller than the smallest honest report: $y_{(k)} < \\min_{i \\in H} y_i$.\nIf this is true, then the median and all reports with a rank lower than or equal to $k$ must be smaller than any honest report. The reports with ranks from $1$ to $k$ are $y_{(1)}, y_{(2)}, \\dots, y_{(k)}$. The number of such reports is exactly $k = \\frac{n+1}{2}$.\nSince all these $\\frac{n+1}{2}$ reports are smaller than any honest report, they must all originate from Byzantine agents. Hence, the number of Byzantine agents, $f$, must be at least this large:\n$$f \\geq k = \\frac{n+1}{2}$$\nThis leads to the same inequality as before:\n$$n \\leq 2f-1$$\nThis again contradicts our assumption that $n \\geq 2f+1$. Therefore, the median cannot be smaller than the minimum honest value.\n\nSince the median can be neither greater than the maximum honest report nor smaller than the minimum honest report, it must lie within the interval defined by them:\n$$\\min_{i \\in H} y_i \\leq y_{(k)} \\leq \\max_{i \\in H} y_i$$\nThis demonstrates that if $n \\geq 2f+1$, the median is guaranteed to lie within the convex hull of the honest data. As all honest data lie within $[x-\\Delta, x+\\Delta]$, the median is also guaranteed to be in this interval. Thus, the condition $n \\geq 2f+1$ is sufficient.\n\n**2. Necessity**\n\nWe will now show that the condition $n \\geq 2f+1$ is necessary. To do this, we demonstrate that if the condition is not met, i.e., if $n < 2f+1$, there exists a strategy for the Byzantine agents to make the median fall outside the interval of honest reports.\n\nSince $n$ is an odd integer, the condition $n < 2f+1$ is equivalent to $n \\leq 2f-1$.\nThis implies $n+1 \\leq 2f$, or rearranged, $f \\geq \\frac{n+1}{2}$.\nThe number of honest agents is $n-f$.\nLet's compare the number of honest agents to the number of positions at one side of the median. The number of reports strictly smaller than the median is $k-1 = \\frac{n+1}{2}-1 = \\frac{n-1}{2}$.\nFrom $n < 2f+1$, we can derive an inequality:\n$$n < 2f+1 \\implies n+1 < 2f+2 \\implies \\frac{n+1}{2} < f+1 \\implies \\frac{n+1}{2} - 1 < f \\implies k-1 < f$$\nAlso, from $n < 2f+1$, we have $2f > n-1$. Adding $n-2f$ to both sides gives $n>2n-2f-1$, so $n-f > n-f$. This isn't helpful. Let's use the other form.\nFrom $n < 2f+1$, we rearrange to $n-2f < 1$. Since $n$ and $f$ are integers, $n-2f \\leq 0$, so $n \\leq 2f$.\nThis means $n-f \\leq f$. The number of honest agents is less than or equal to the number of Byzantine agents.\nLet's check the rank of the median versus the number of honest agents. We want to show that if $n < 2f+1$, the median rank can be 'overwhelmed' by Byzantine agents.\nWe have $n < 2f+1 \\iff n - 2f < 1 \\iff 2n - 2f < n+1 \\iff n-f < \\frac{n+1}{2}$.\nLet's see: $n-f < \\frac{n+1}{2} \\iff 2n - 2f < n+1 \\iff n < 2f+1$. This is correct.\nThe inequality $n-f < \\frac{n+1}{2}$ means that the number of honest agents is strictly less than the number of reports with rank less than or equal to the median's rank.\n\nNow we construct the adversarial strategy. Assume $n < 2f+1$.\nThe $f$ Byzantine agents decide to collude and report extremely small, identical values. For instance, they all report $y_B = x - 2\\Delta$. This value is outside the honest interval $[x-\\Delta, x+\\Delta]$.\nThe $n-f$ honest agents report values within $[x-\\Delta, x+\\Delta]$. To make the argument clear, let's assume the worst case for the adversary, where all honest agents report the largest possible value, $y_H = x+\\Delta$.\nThe collected multiset of reports is $\\{\\underbrace{x-2\\Delta, \\dots, x-2\\Delta}_{f \\text{ times}}, \\underbrace{x+\\Delta, \\dots, x+\\Delta}_{n-f \\text{ times}}\\}$.\nWhen these $n$ reports are sorted, the $f$ Byzantine reports will occupy the lowest ranks, and the $n-f$ honest reports will occupy the highest ranks.\nThe sorted list is: $y_{(1)} = \\dots = y_{(f)} = x-2\\Delta$ and $y_{(f+1)} = \\dots = y_{(n)} = x+\\Delta$.\nThe median is the report at rank $k=\\frac{n+1}{2}$. To determine the value of the median, we must check if its rank $k$ is less than or equal to $f$.\nWe need to check if $\\frac{n+1}{2} \\leq f$.\nAs shown before, our starting assumption $n < 2f+1$ (with $n$ being odd) is equivalent to $n \\leq 2f-1$.\nThis implies $n+1 \\leq 2f$, which in turn means $\\frac{n+1}{2} \\leq f$.\nSince the median's rank $k = \\frac{n+1}{2}$ is less than or equal to $f$, the median $y_{(k)}$ will be one of the Byzantine reports.\nThus, $y_{(k)} = x-2\\Delta$.\nThis value lies outside the convex hull of the honest reports (which in this case is the single point $\\{x+\\Delta\\}$) and also outside the required interval $[x-\\Delta, x+\\Delta]$.\nA symmetric argument can be made with Byzantine agents reporting a very large value, pulling the median above the honest interval.\nThis demonstrates that if $n < 2f+1$, the guarantee cannot be met. Therefore, the condition $n \\geq 2f+1$ is necessary.\n\n**3. Conclusion**\n\nThe condition $n \\geq 2f+1$ is both necessary and sufficient to guarantee that the median of the reports lies within the convex hull of the honest reports, and thus within the interval $[x-\\Delta, x+\\Delta]$.\nThe problem asks for the minimum number of agents, $n_{\\min}$, as a function of $f$. This is the smallest integer $n$ that satisfies $n \\geq 2f+1$ and the problem constraint that $n$ is odd.\nSince $f$ is an integer, $2f$ is an even integer, and $2f+1$ is an odd integer.\nTherefore, the smallest integer $n$ that satisfies $n \\geq 2f+1$ is $n = 2f+1$ itself, which is already odd.\nThe minimum number of agents required is $n_{\\min} = 2f+1$.",

The derivation proceeds in four sequential steps as defined in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we determine the exact worst-case total number of bid valuations for CNP, denoted as $B_{CNP}$. The system consists of $m$ distinct tasks and $n$ autonomous agents. In the CNP model, each of the $m$ tasks is announced individually. In the worst-case scenario, every one of the $n$ agents submits a bid for each of the $m$ tasks. Thus, the total number of bids is the product of the number of agents and the number of tasks.\n$$B_{CNP} = n \\cdot m$$\n\nSecond, we determine the exact worst-case total number of bid valuations for CA, denoted as $B_{CA}$. In this model, agents can bid on bundles of tasks, where a bundle can have a size $i$ such that $1 \\leq i \\leq k$. The number of possible bundles of a specific size $i$ that can be formed from a set of $m$ tasks is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{m}{i}$. To find the total number of bundles an agent could potentially bid on, we must sum the number of possible bundles for all allowed sizes, from $i=1$ to $i=k$. This sum is $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\binom{m}{i}$. In the worst case, each of the $n$ agents submits a valuation for every one of these bundles. Therefore, the total number of bid valuations is:\n$$B_{CA} = n \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\binom{m}{i} \\right)$$\n\nThird, we compute the exact ratio $R(n,m,k)$ of the CA bid enumeration effort to the CNP bid enumeration effort. This ratio is defined as:\n$$R(n,m,k) = \\frac{B_{CA}}{B_{CNP}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived in the first two steps:\n$$R(n,m,k) = \\frac{n \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\binom{m}{i} \\right)}{n \\cdot m}$$\nThe factor $n$, representing the number of agents, cancels out. This shows that the ratio of the computational burden, in terms of bid enumeration, is independent of the number of agents. The ratio simplifies to a function of $m$ and $k$ only, which we can denote as $R(m,k)$.\n$$R(m,k) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\binom{m}{i}}{m}$$\n\nFourth, we derive the leading-order asymptotic term of $R(m,k)$ for a fixed integer $k \\geq 1$ as the number of tasks $m$ approaches infinity ($m \\to \\infty$). We begin by analyzing the numerator of $R(m,k)$, which is the sum $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\binom{m}{i}$. The problem provides the asymptotic approximation for the binomial coefficient: for a fixed $i$ and $m \\to \\infty$, $\\binom{m}{i} = \\frac{m^{i}}{i!} + \\mathcal{O}(m^{i-1})$.\n\nThe sum can be expanded as:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\binom{m}{i} = \\binom{m}{1} + \\binom{m}{2} + \\dots + \\binom{m}{k}$$\nAs $m \\to \\infty$, the term in this sum that grows the fastest will determine the asymptotic behavior of the entire sum. The term $\\binom{m}{i}$ is a polynomial in $m$ of degree $i$. Therefore, the term with the largest value of $i$ in the sum, which is $\\binom{m}{k}$, will be the dominant term. Using the provided approximation:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\binom{m}{i} = \\binom{m}{k} + \\binom{m}{k-1} + \\dots + \\binom{m}{1}$$\n$$= \\left(\\frac{m^k}{k!} + \\mathcal{O}(m^{k-1})\\right) + \\left(\\frac{m^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} + \\mathcal{O}(m^{k-2})\\right) + \\dots$$\nThe term with the highest power of $m$ is $\\frac{m^k}{k!}$.
