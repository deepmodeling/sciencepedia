            "problem": "A digital twin of a two-zone thermal subsystem within a cyber-physical building energy management system evolves according to a linear time-invariant discrete-time model subject to additive uncertainty. The true plant state $x_{k} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ evolves as $x_{k+1} = A x_{k} + B u_{k} + w_{k}$, while the nominal model in a tube-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) design would evolve with $w_{k} = 0$ and plan $u_{k}$ to track setpoints. In this scenario, consider the open-loop setting with no actuation, that is $u_{k} = 0$ for all $k$, so that the closed-loop dynamics reduce to $x_{k+1} = A x_{k} + w_{k}$, where the additive disturbance $w_{k}$ represents model-plant mismatch and satisfies $w_{k} \\in \\mathcal{W}$ for all $k \\geq 0$. The set $\\mathcal{W}$ is a compact, convex, and centrally symmetric uncertainty set. The fundamental definition of set reachability under linear dynamics and bounded additive uncertainty is as follows: the $k$-step reachable set from an initial state $x_{0}$ is the set of all states $x_{k}$ that can arise from all admissible disturbance sequences $\\{w_{0},\\dots,w_{k-1}\\}$ with each $w_{i} \\in \\mathcal{W}$, given the dynamics and initial condition.\n\nUsing only the core definitions of Minkowski sum and linear set images, and the recursive definition of reachability for additive bounded disturbances, derive a closed-form representation for the $N$-step reachable set from $x_{0}$, and then compute it explicitly for the following data:\n- $A = \\mathrm{diag}(0.8, 0.6)$,\n- $u_{k} = 0$ for all $k \\geq 0$,\n- initial condition $x_{0} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2.5 \\\\ -1.25 \\end{pmatrix}$,\n- disturbance set $\\mathcal{W} = \\{ w \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} : \\|w\\|_{\\infty} \\leq 0.05 \\}$,\n- horizon $N = 4$.\n\nExpress your final reachable set as a Cartesian product of two closed intervals $[a_{1}, b_{1}] \\times [a_{2}, b_{2}]$ with exact decimal values.

It is a well-posed problem in the domain of control theory and reachability analysis, providing all necessary information and definitions, and is free of scientific or logical flaws.\n\nThe first step is to derive a general closed-form representation for the $N$-step reachable set, denoted as $\\mathcal{R}_{N}(x_{0})$, for the given discrete-time linear system. The system dynamics are given by:\n$$x_{k+1} = A x_{k} + w_{k}$$\nwhere the state is $x_{k} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$, the control input is $u_{k}=0$, and the disturbance $w_{k}$ is constrained to a compact, convex, and centrally symmetric set $\\mathcal{W}$, i.e., $w_{k} \\in \\mathcal{W}$ for all $k \\geq 0$.\n\nThe reachable set at step $k+1$, denoted $\\mathcal{R}_{k+1}(x_{0})$, is the set of all possible states $x_{k+1}$ given that the state at step $k$, $x_{k}$, belongs to the $k$-step reachable set $\\mathcal{R}_{k}(x_{0})$. This can be expressed using set-theoretic operations. Specifically, we take the linear image of the set $\\mathcal{R}_{k}(x_{0})$ under the transformation $A$ and compute its Minkowski sum with the disturbance set $\\mathcal{W}$. The Minkowski sum of two sets $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ is defined as $S_{1} \\oplus S_{2} = \\{s_{1} + s_{2} \\mid s_{1} \\in S_{1}, s_{2} \\in S_{2}\\}$.\n\nThe recursive definition of the reachable set is:\n$$\\mathcal{R}_{k+1}(x_{0}) = A \\mathcal{R}_{k}(x_{0}) \\oplus \\mathcal{W}$$\nThe recursion starts from the initial condition, which is a singleton set:\n$$\\mathcal{R}_{0}(x_{0}) = \\{x_{0}\\}$$\nWe can unroll this recursion to find the general form for $\\mathcal{R}_{N}(x_{0})$.\n\nFor $k=1$:\n$$\\mathcal{R}_{1}(x_{0}) = A \\mathcal{R}_{0}(x_{0}) \\oplus \\mathcal{W} = A \\{x_{0}\\} \\oplus \\mathcal{W} = \\{A x_{0}\\} \\oplus \\mathcal{W}$$\nThis represents all states $x_1 = A x_0 + w_0$ for all $w_0 \\in \\mathcal{W}$.\n\nFor $k=2$:\n$$\\mathcal{R}_{2}(x_{0}) = A \\mathcal{R}_{1}(x_{0}) \\oplus \\mathcal{W} = A (\\{A x_{0}\\} \\oplus \\mathcal{W}) \\oplus \\mathcal{W}$$\nUsing the distributive property of linear maps over the Minkowski sum, $A(S_{1} \\oplus S_{2}) = A S_{1} \\oplus A S_{2}$, we get:\n$$\\mathcal{R}_{2}(x_{0}) = A\\{A x_{0}\\} \\oplus A\\mathcal{W} \\oplus \\mathcal{W} = \\{A^{2} x_{0}\\} \\oplus A\\mathcal{W} \\oplus \\mathcal{W}$$\nThis represents all states $x_2 = A^2 x_0 + A w_0 + w_1$ for all $w_0, w_1 \\in \\mathcal{W}$.\n\nBy induction, for an arbitrary horizon $N$, the state $x_{N}$ is given by iterating the dynamics:\n$$x_{N} = A x_{N-1} + w_{N-1} = A(A x_{N-2} + w_{N-2}) + w_{N-1} = \\dots = A^{N} x_{0} + \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} A^{i} w_{N-1-i}$$\nChanging the summation index $j=N-1-i$, we have:\n$$x_{N} = A^{N} x_{0} + \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} A^{N-1-j} w_{j}$$\nThis expression for a single trajectory $x_{N}$ corresponds to the following set-theoretic representation for the $N$-step reachable set:\n$$\\mathcal{R}_{N}(x_{0}) = \\{A^{N} x_{0}\\} \\oplus \\bigoplus_{i=0}^{N-1} A^{i} \\mathcal{W}$$\nThis is the desired closed-form representation. It states that the reachable set at step $N$ is a translation of the accumulated disturbance set $\\bigoplus_{i=0}^{N-1} A^{i} \\mathcal{W}$ by the nominal state trajectory endpoint $A^{N} x_{0}$.\n\nNow we apply this formula to the specific data provided:\n- $A = \\mathrm{diag}(0.8, 0.6) = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.8 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0.6 \\end{pmatrix}$\n- $x_{0} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2.5 \\\\ -1.25 \\end{pmatrix}$\n- $\\mathcal{W} = \\{ w \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2} : \\|w\\|_{\\infty} \\leq 0.05 \\}$.

To ensure that the solution satisfies the original chance constraint with a confidence level of $1 - \\delta$, we require the probability of obtaining a \"bad\" solution (one with $V(\\theta_N^*) > \\epsilon$) to be no more than $\\delta$. This yields the sample complexity condition:\n$$ \\sum_{i=0}^{d-1} \\binom{N}{i} \\epsilon^i (1-\\epsilon)^{N-i} \\le \\delta $$\nThis is the fundamental condition we must solve for $N$.\n\n### Calculation of Sample Size N\nWe now compute the minimal integer sample size $N$ that satisfies this condition for the given parameters:\n- Violation level: $\\epsilon = 0.1$\n- Confidence parameter: $\\delta = 1 \\times 10^{-4}$\n- Decision vector dimension: $d = 2$\n\nSubstituting these values into the inequality, we get:\n$$ \\sum_{i=0}^{2-1} \\binom{N}{i} (0.1)^i (1-0.1)^{N-i} \\le 1 \\times 10^{-4} $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=0}^{1} \\binom{N}{i} (0.1)^i (0.9)^{N-i} \\le 10^{-4} $$\nExpanding the sum for $i=0$ and $i=1$:\n$$ \\binom{N}{0} (0.1)^0 (0.9)^N + \\binom{N}{1} (0.1)^1 (0.9)^{N-1} \\le 10^{-4} $$\n$$ (1)(1)(0.9)^N + (N)(0.1)(0.9)^{N-1} \\le 10^{-4} $$\nWe can factor out $(0.9)^N$:\n$$ (0.9)^N + \\frac{N \\cdot 0.1}{0.9} (0.9)^N \\le 10^{-4} $$\n$$ (0.9)^N \\left(1 + \\frac{N}{9}\\right) \\le 10^{-4} $$\nWe must find the smallest integer $N$ that satisfies this transcendental inequality. Let's define the function $f(N) = (0.9)^N (1 + N/9)$ and test integer values of $N$.\nWe seek the smallest integer $N$ such that $f(N) \\le 10^{-4}$.\n\nLet's test values of $N$:\nFor $N=112$:\n$$ f(112) = (0.9)^{112} \\left(1 + \\frac{112}{9}\\right) \\approx (7.822 \\times 10^{-6}) \\left(\\frac{9+112}{9}\\right) = (7.822 \\times 10^{-6}) \\left(\\frac{121}{9}\\right) $$\n$$ f(112) \\approx (7.822 \\times 10^{-6}) (13.444\\dots) \\approx 1.0519 \\times 10^{-4} $$\nSince $1.0519 \\times 10^{-4} > 1 \\times 10^{-4}$, $N=112$ is not sufficient.\n\nLet's test $N=113$:\n$$ f(113) = (0.9)^{113} \\left(1 + \\frac{113}{9}\\right) = (0.9) \\cdot (0.9)^{112} \\left(\\frac{9+113}{9}\\right) $$\n$$ f(113) \\approx (0.9) \\cdot (7.822 \\times 10^{-6}) \\left(\\frac{122}{9}\\right) = (7.0398 \\times 10^{-6}) (13.555\\dots) $$\n$$ f(113) \\approx 0.9543 \\times 10^{-4} $$\nSince $0.9543 \\times 10^{-4} < 1 \\times 10^{-4}$, $N=113$ is sufficient.\n\nThus, the minimal integer sample size required to meet the guarantee is $113$.",
