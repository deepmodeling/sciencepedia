Encryption, decryption, and secure transport all take time, which in a discrete-time system, translates to a delay between when a state is measured and when a control action is applied. This exercise  provides a hands-on analysis of this critical effect, guiding you to derive the stability boundary for a control system as a function of this delay. By working through this problem, you will see how to determine the maximum tolerable delay before a stable system is pushed into instability.",

No flaws are identified.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe dynamics of the cyber-physical system are given by the discrete-time LTI equation:\n$$x_{k+1} = a x_k + b u_k$$\nThe control input is determined by a state-feedback law with a constant integer delay $\\ell$:\n$$u_k = K x_{k-\\ell}$$\nSubstituting the control law into the plant dynamics yields the closed-loop equation for the state $x_k$:\n$$x_{k+1} = a x_k + b K x_{k-\\ell}$$\nFor the system to be Schur stable, the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system's state transition operator must all have a magnitude strictly less than $1$. The eigenvalues are the roots of the system's characteristic equation.\n\nTo find the characteristic equation, we can utilize the z-transform. Let $X(z)$ be the z-transform of the state sequence $x_k$. Applying the z-transform to the closed-loop equation, we obtain:\n$$z X(z) = a X(z) + b K z^{-\\ell} X(z)$$\nAssuming a non-trivial solution ($X(z) \\neq 0$), we can divide by $X(z)$ to get the characteristic equation in terms of $z$:\n$$z = a + b K z^{-\\ell}$$\nMultiplying by $z^{\\ell}$ gives the polynomial form of the characteristic equation:\n$$z^{\\ell+1} = a z^{\\ell} + b K$$\n$$z^{\\ell+1} - a z^{\\ell} - b K = 0$$\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of the closed-loop system are the roots of this polynomial. Substituting the given parameters $a = 0.6$, $b = 1$, and $K = -0.8$, the characteristic equation becomes:\n$$\\lambda^{\\ell+1} - 0.6 \\lambda^{\\ell} + 0.8 = 0$$\nSchur stability requires that all roots $\\lambda_i$ of this polynomial satisfy $|\\lambda_i| < 1$.\n\nThe system transitions from stable to unstable when at least one root lies on the boundary of the stability region, i.e., on the unit circle in the complex plane. We analyze this boundary case by letting $\\lambda = e^{i\\omega}$ for some frequency $\\omega \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Substituting this into the characteristic equation:\n$$e^{i\\omega(\\ell+1)} - 0.6 e^{i\\omega\\ell} + 0.8 = 0$$\nWe can rearrange this as:\n$$e^{i\\omega(\\ell+1)} = 0.6 e^{i\\omega\\ell} - 0.8$$\nTaking the squared magnitude of both sides:\n$$|e^{i\\omega(\\ell+1)}|^2 = |0.6 e^{i\\omega\\ell} - 0.8|^2$$\nThe magnitude of $e^{i\\phi}$ is always $1$. For the right-hand side, we expand the complex number:\n$$1^2 = |0.6(\\cos(\\omega\\ell) + i\\sin(\\omega\\ell)) - 0.8|^2$$\n$$1 = |(0.6\\cos(\\omega\\ell) - 0.8) + i(0.6\\sin(\\omega\\ell))|^2$$\n$$1 = (0.6\\cos(\\omega\\ell) - 0.8)^2 + (0.6\\sin(\\omega\\ell))^2$$\n$$1 = (0.36\\cos^2(\\omega\\ell) - 0.96\\cos(\\omega\\ell) + 0.64) + 0.36\\sin^2(\\omega\\ell)$$\n$$1 = 0.36(\\cos^2(\\omega\\ell) + \\sin^2(\\omega\\ell)) - 0.96\\cos(\\omega\\ell) + 0.64$$\nUsing the identity $\\cos^2(\\theta) + \\sin^2(\\theta) = 1$:\n$$1 = 0.36 - 0.96\\cos(\\omega\\ell) + 0.64$$\n$$1 = 1 - 0.96\\cos(\\omega\\ell)$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$0 = -0.96\\cos(\\omega\\ell)$$\n$$\\cos(\\omega\\ell) = 0$$\nThis is a necessary condition for a root to lie on the unit circle. To find the corresponding frequency $\\omega$, we analyze the real and imaginary parts of the original complex equation $e^{i\\omega(\\ell+1)} - 0.6 e^{i\\omega\\ell} + 0.8 = 0$.\nThe imaginary part is:\n$$\\sin(\\omega(\\ell+1)) - 0.6\\sin(\\omega\\ell) = 0$$\nUsing the angle addition formula $\\sin(A+B) = \\sin(A)\\cos(B) + \\cos(A)\\sin(B)$:\n$$\\sin(\\omega\\ell)\\cos(\\omega) + \\cos(\\omega\\ell)\\sin(\\omega) - 0.6\\sin(\\omega\\ell) = 0$$\nSubstituting our condition $\\cos(\\omega\\ell) = 0$:\n$$\\sin(\\omega\\ell)\\cos(\\omega) + (0)\\sin(\\omega) - 0.6\\sin(\\omega\\ell) = 0$$\n$$\\sin(\\omega\\ell)(\\cos(\\omega) - 0.6) = 0$$\nSince $\\cos(\\omega\\ell) = 0$, it must be that $\\sin(\\omega\\ell) = \\pm 1 \\neq 0$. Therefore, the other factor must be zero:\n$$\\cos(\\omega) - 0.6 = 0 \\implies \\cos(\\omega) = 0.6$$\nThe crossing frequency $\\omega_c$ is any frequency such that $\\cos(\\omega_c) = 0.6$. The smallest positive such frequency is $\\omega_c = \\arccos(0.6)$.\n\nThe condition $\\cos(\\omega_c \\ell) = 0$ implies that $\\omega_c \\ell$ must be an odd multiple of $\\pi/2$:\n$$\\omega_c \\ell = (2n+1)\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\text{ for some integer } n \\ge 0$$\nThe critical delay $\\ell_{crit}$ at which the first root crosses the unit circle corresponds to the smallest positive value of $\\ell$, which occurs for $n=0$:\n$$\\omega_c \\ell_{crit} = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$$\n$$\\ell_{crit} = \\frac{\\pi/2}{\\omega_c} = \\frac{\\pi}{2 \\arccos(0.6)}$$\nTo find the largest integer $\\ell$ for which the system is stable, we must check if the system is stable for small $\\ell$ and then find the largest integer $\\ell < \\ell_{crit}$.\n\nFor $\\ell=0$, the characteristic equation is $\\lambda - 0.6\\lambda^0 + 0.8 = 0$, which simplifies to $\\lambda - 0.6 + 0.8 = 0$, yielding $\\lambda = -0.2$. Since $|\\lambda|=0.2 < 1$, the system is stable for $\\ell=0$. This implies the system is stable for all delays $0 \\le \\ell < \\ell_{crit}$.\n\nNow, we evaluate the numerical value of $\\ell_{crit}$. We know the values of cosine for common angles:\n$\\cos(\\pi/3) = 0.5$ and $\\cos(\\pi/4) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} \\approx 0.707$.\nSince $0.5 < 0.6 < 0.707$, and arccosine is a decreasing function on its domain, we have:\n$$\\arccos(0.5) > \\arccos(0.6) > \\arccos(0.707)$$\n$$\\frac{\\pi}{3} > \\arccos(0.6) > \\frac{\\pi}{4}$$\nNow we can bound $\\ell_{crit}$:\n$$\\frac{\\pi/(2)}{\\pi/3} < \\ell_{crit} < \\frac{\\pi/(2)}{\\pi/4}$$\n$$1.5 < \\ell_{crit} < 2$$\nThe critical delay $\\ell_{crit}$ is a value between $1.5$ and $2$. The system is Schur stable for any integer delay $\\ell$ such that $\\ell < \\ell_{crit}$. The integers satisfying this condition are $\\ell=0$ and $\\ell=1$.\nThe largest such integer is $1$. For any integer delay $\\ell \\ge 2$, at least one eigenvalue will have a magnitude greater than or equal to $1$, making the system not strictly Schur stable.\n\nTherefore, the largest integer delay $\\ell$ for which the closed-loop spectral radius is strictly less than $1$ is $1$.",

            "problem": "A Digital Twin (DT) of a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) implements a discrete-time controller with sampling period $T_s$ and transmits control commands over a dedicated secure channel. Commands are short and often repeat across successive samples because the plant spends extended intervals near steady-state. The secure channel must enforce confidentiality and integrity. Two designs are under consideration:\n\n- Design R: Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM), which is a randomized authenticated encryption. Each packet includes an Initialization Vector (IV) of length $v$ and a Message Authentication Code (MAC) tag of length $t$. AES-GCM requires unique nonces (IVs) for security.\n\n- Design D: Deterministic Authenticated Encryption (DAE), which removes per-packet random IVs while preserving integrity with a MAC tag of length $t$. DAE is not Indistinguishability under Chosen-Plaintext Attack (IND-CPA) secure because identical plaintexts encrypt to identical ciphertexts under a fixed key and associated data, leaking equality patterns.\n\nAssume the following parameters and constraints hold for the control channel:\n\n- Sampling period $T_s = 3.3\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n- Link bandwidth $B = 192\\,\\mathrm{kbit/s}$.\n- Base network latency (propagation plus queuing under reserved service) $L_{\\text{base}} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{ms}$.\n- Worst-case jitter bound $J_{\\max} = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ for the secure-control path.\n- Encryption (and decryption) computational overhead per command is $E_{\\text{enc}} = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{ms}$ (the decryption overhead is absorbed at the actuator side and does not impact the DT’s outbound deadline).\n- Control command payload size $m = 12\\,\\mathrm{bytes}$.\n- MAC tag size $t = 16\\,\\mathrm{bytes}$.\n- IV size for randomized encryption $v = 12\\,\\mathrm{bytes}$ (Design R); Design D carries no random IV.\n- The reserved control slot on the link imposes a per-sample occupancy cap of $\\rho_{\\max} = 0.5$, where occupancy is defined as the serialization time divided by $T_s$.\n- End-to-end timing requirement: the actuation command must be delivered before the next sampling instant; i.e., the worst-case end-to-end latency must be strictly less than $T_s$.\n\nModel the per-packet worst-case end-to-end latency $L_{\\text{wc}}$ as the sum of the cryptographic processing time, the base network latency, the serialization delay, and jitter:\n$$\nL_{\\text{wc}} = E_{\\text{enc}} + L_{\\text{base}} + \\frac{S}{B} + J_{\\max},\n$$\nwhere $S$ is the total bytes transmitted for the encrypted packet. For Design R, $S_R = m + t + v$. For Design D, $S_D = m + t$.\n\nUse the provided parameters to compute the worst-case latency and the link occupancy for each design. Then, decide whether the control loop’s strict timing and bandwidth constraints justify relaxing semantic security (Indistinguishability under Chosen-Plaintext Attack (IND-CPA)) and favor Design D over Design R in this CPS with repeating commands.\n\nWhich option is most correct?\n\nA. Design D is justified. Under the given parameters, Design R violates the worst-case deadline and the occupancy cap, while Design D meets both. Because commands repeat, relaxing semantic security (accepting equality of ciphertexts) is permissible if complemented by per-epoch rekeying (e.g., re-derive the DAE key every $N$ samples) to bound linkability in time, together with integrity via MAC. This control-aware relaxation preserves closed-loop timing feasibility.\n\nB. Design R remains mandatory because semantic security must never be relaxed. Even if Design R exceeds the worst-case deadline and occupancy cap under the given parameters, randomized encryption’s IND-CPA security outweighs control timing, so the controller should accept missed deadlines.\n\nC. Design R can meet the constraints by reusing IVs to cut the $v$-byte overhead; nonce reuse does not compromise integrity in AES-GCM and is safe in a control setting with short messages.\n\nD. Design D is acceptable without any additional measures. Using a long-term static key and omitting rekeying or traffic shaping is secure enough in a control channel because the command alphabet is finite and equality leakage does not reveal actionable information to an adversary.",

Since $L_{\\text{wc, R}} \\approx 3.567\\,\\mathrm{ms} > 3.3\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, **Design R violates the end-to-end timing constraint**.\n\n**Analysis of Design D (Deterministic DAE)**\n\n1.  **Packet Size ($S_D$)**:\n    The total size is the sum of payload and MAC tag, with no IV.\n    $$S_D = m + t = 12\\,\\mathrm{bytes} + 16\\,\\mathrm{bytes} = 28\\,\\mathrm{bytes}$$\n    In bits, this is:\n    $$S_D = 28\\,\\mathrm{bytes} \\times 8\\,\\mathrm{bits/byte} = 224\\,\\mathrm{bits}$$\n\n2.  **Serialization Delay ($S_D/B$)**:\n    $$\\frac{S_D}{B} = \\frac{224\\,\\mathrm{bits}}{192 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{bit/s}} = \\frac{224}{192000}\\,\\mathrm{s} = \\frac{7}{6000}\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\n    Converting to milliseconds:\n    $$\\frac{7}{6000}\\,\\mathrm{s} \\times 1000\\,\\mathrm{ms/s} = \\frac{7}{6}\\,\\mathrm{ms} \\approx 1.167\\,\\mathrm{ms}$$\n\n3.  **Link Occupancy ($\\rho_D$)**:\n    $$\\rho_D = \\frac{S_D/B}{T_s} = \\frac{7/6\\,\\mathrm{ms}}{3.3\\,\\mathrm{ms}} \\approx \\frac{1.167}{3.3} \\approx 0.354$$\n    Since $\\rho_D \\approx 0.354 < 0.5$, **Design D meets the occupancy constraint**.\n\n4.  **Worst-Case Latency ($L_{\\text{wc, D}}$)**:\n    $$L_{\\text{wc, D}} = E_{\\text{enc}} + L_{\\text{base}} + \\frac{S_D}{B} + J_{\\max}$$\n    $$L_{\\text{wc, D}} = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{ms} + 1.2\\,\\mathrm{ms} + \\frac{7}{6}\\,\\mathrm{ms} + 0.3\\,\\mathrm{ms} = 1.9\\,\\mathrm{ms} + \\frac{7}{6}\\,\\mathrm{ms} \\approx 1.9 + 1.167 = 3.067\\,\\mathrm{ms}$$\n    Since $L_{\\text{wc, D}} \\approx 3.067\\,\\mathrm{ms} < 3.3\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, **Design D meets the end-to-end timing constraint**.\n\n### Summary of Quantitative Results\n-   **Design R**: Violates both the occupancy constraint ($\\rho_R \\approx 0.505 > 0.5$) and the latency deadline ($L_{\\text{wc, R}} \\approx 3.567\\,\\mathrm{ms} > 3.3\\,\\mathrm{ms}$). It is infeasible under the given parameters.\n-   **Design D**: Meets both the occupancy constraint ($\\rho_D \\approx 0.354 < 0.5$) and the latency deadline ($L_{\\text{wc, D}} \\approx 3.067\\,\\mathrm{ms} < 3.3\\,\\mathrm{ms}$). It is feasible.\n\nThe quantitative analysis demonstrates that the system cannot function correctly with Design R, as it would miss deadlines, which can lead to control loop instability. Therefore, a solution that meets the timing constraints is necessary. The question becomes whether the security relaxation in Design D is justifiable.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Design D is justified. Under the given parameters, Design R violates the worst-case deadline and the occupancy cap, while Design D meets both. Because commands repeat, relaxing semantic security (accepting equality of ciphertexts) is permissible if complemented by per-epoch rekeying (e.g., re-derive the DAE key every $N$ samples) to bound linkability in time, together with integrity via MAC. This control-aware relaxation preserves closed-loop timing feasibility.**\n-   The first sentence is fully supported by the calculations above. Design R fails, and Design D succeeds.\n-   The second sentence addresses the security trade-off. It acknowledges the weakness of DAE (leakage of equality) but proposes a standard and effective mitigation: periodic rekeying. This bounds the duration over which an attacker can link identical commands, thus limiting the information leakage. This approach represents a sound engineering trade-off, prioritizing the fundamental operational requirement (timing feasibility for control stability) while adopting a measured, risk-managed approach to security. This philosophy is often termed \"security-control co-design.\" The presence of a MAC preserves integrity, which is often more critical than confidentiality in control systems.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.** This option accurately reflects the calculations and proposes a valid, responsible engineering compromise.\n\n**B. Design R remains mandatory because semantic security must never be relaxed. Even if Design R exceeds the worst-case deadline and occupancy cap under the given parameters, randomized encryption’s IND-CPA security outweighs control timing, so the controller should accept missed deadlines.**\n-   This option posits that a specific security property (IND-CPA) is an absolute requirement that must be met even at the cost of system failure. In a real-time control system, consistently missing deadlines leads to performance degradation and, critically, can cause instability, leading to physical damage or safety hazards. The purpose of security is to protect the function and safety of the system; an approach to security that compromises the system's fundamental function is illogical and dangerous. This absolutist view is poor engineering.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Design R can meet the constraints by reusing IVs to cut the $v$-byte overhead; nonce reuse does not compromise integrity in AES-GCM and is safe in a control setting with short messages.**\n-   This option suggests a cryptographically catastrophic action. Reusing a nonce (IV) with the same key in AES-GCM completely breaks both its confidentiality and its authentication properties. Specifically, an attacker observing two ciphertexts encrypted with the same nonce can recover the authentication subkey, allowing them to forge messages at will. The statement that \"nonce reuse does not compromise integrity\" is factually and dangerously false. It is one of the most well-known vulnerabilities of GCM. The problem statement itself correctly notes that GCM requires *unique* nonces for security.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Design D is acceptable without any additional measures. Using a long-term static key and omitting rekeying or traffic shaping is secure enough in a control channel because the command alphabet is finite and equality leakage does not reveal actionable information to an adversary.**\n-   This option correctly identifies that Design D is feasible but is overly complacent about the security risks. The leakage of command equality, especially with a long-term static key, can provide significant \"actionable information\" to an adversary via traffic analysis. An attacker could learn the system's operational patterns, detect transitions between states (e.g., from idle to active), and infer the system's response to events without ever decrypting a message. Claiming this leakage is not actionable is an unsubstantiated and risky assumption. Good security practice dictates that known information leaks should be mitigated if possible. Option A's suggestion of rekeying is a prudent mitigation that this option dismisses.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**",
