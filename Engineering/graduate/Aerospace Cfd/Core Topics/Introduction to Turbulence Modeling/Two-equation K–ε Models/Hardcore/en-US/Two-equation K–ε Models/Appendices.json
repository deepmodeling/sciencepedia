A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe instantaneous velocity vector, $\\mathbf{u}$, can be decomposed into a time-averaged mean component, $\\mathbf{U}$, and a fluctuating component, $\\mathbf{u'}$, using Reynolds decomposition: $\\mathbf{u} = \\mathbf{U} + \\mathbf{u'}$. In a Cartesian coordinate system with components $(u, v, w)$, this is written as $u = \\overline{u} + u'$, $v = \\overline{v} + v'$, and $w = \\overline{w} + w'$. The problem specifies a mean speed $U$ at the inlet, which for a typical wind-tunnel setup implies a unidirectional mean flow. We align the $x$-axis with this mean flow direction, such that the mean velocity vector is $\\mathbf{U} = (U, 0, 0)$. Thus, $\\overline{u} = U$, $\\overline{v} = 0$, and $\\overline{w} = 0$.\n\nThe turbulence kinetic energy per unit mass, $k$, is defined as one-half the trace of the Reynolds stress tensor (normalized by density), which is equivalent to half the sum of the variances of the velocity fluctuations:\n$$k = \\frac{1}{2} (\\overline{u'^2} + \\overline{v'^2} + \\overline{w'^2})$$\nwhere the overbar denotes a time average.\n\nThe turbulence intensity, $I$, is defined as the ratio of the root-mean-square (RMS) of the streamwise velocity fluctuation to the mean speed. The streamwise direction is the $x$-direction, so the corresponding fluctuation is $u'$. The RMS of $u'$ is $\\sqrt{\\overline{u'^2}}$. Therefore, the definition of $I$ is:\n$$I = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\overline{u'^2}}}{U}$$\n\nThe problem states that the inflow turbulence is isotropic. A key property of isotropic turbulence is that the normal components of the Reynolds stress tensor are equal. This means the variances of the velocity fluctuations are the same in all three orthogonal directions:\n$$\\overline{u'^2} = \\overline{v'^2} = \\overline{w'^2}$$\n\nWe can now derive the expression for $k$. From the definition of turbulence intensity, we solve for the streamwise velocity variance, $\\overline{u'^2}$:\n$$\\sqrt{\\overline{u'^2}} = I U$$\nSquaring both sides of the equation yields:\n$$\\overline{u'^2} = (I U)^2 = I^2 U^2$$\nUsing the isotropy condition, we can state that all three velocity variances are equal to this value:\n$$\\overline{v'^2} = I^2 U^2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\overline{w'^2} = I^2 U^2$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the definition of turbulence kinetic energy, $k$:\n$$k = \\frac{1}{2} (\\overline{u'^2} + \\overline{v'^2} + \\overline{w'^2}) = \\frac{1}{2} (I^2 U^2 + I^2 U^2 + I^2 U^2)$$\n$$k = \\frac{1}{2} (3 I^2 U^2)$$\nThis provides the derived relationship between $k$, $I$, and $U$ under the assumption of isotropy:\n$$k = \\frac{3}{2} I^2 U^2$$\n\nNext, we evaluate $k$ for the given numerical values: $I = 0.05$ (dimensionless) and $U = 50 \\, \\mathrm{m/s}$.\n$$k = \\frac{3}{2} (0.05)^2 (50 \\, \\mathrm{m/s})^2$$\n$$k = \\frac{3}{2} (0.0025) (2500 \\, \\mathrm{m^2/s^2})$$\nCalculating the product within the parentheses:\n$$(0.0025) \\times (2500) = 6.25$$\nNow, substitute this back into the equation for $k$:\n$$k = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 6.25 \\, \\mathrm{m^2/s^2}$$\n$$k = 1.5 \\times 6.25 \\, \\mathrm{m^2/s^2}$$\n$$k = 9.375 \\, \\mathrm{m^2/s^2}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.

It is neither trivial nor artificially complex.\n7.  **Outside Scientific Verifiability**: The derivation is a mathematical exercise based on an established physical model, and is thus verifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe production rate of turbulent kinetic energy per unit mass, denoted as $P_k$, is defined by the interaction of the Reynolds stresses and the mean velocity gradients. In its general form, it is written as:\n$$\nP_k = -\\overline{u'_i u'_j} \\frac{\\partial U_i}{\\partial x_j}\n$$\nFor a fully developed plane channel flow, the mean velocity is primarily in the streamwise direction, let's say $x_1$, and varies only with the wall-normal coordinate, $x_2=y$. Thus, $U_1 = U(y)$ and all other mean velocity components are zero. The only non-zero component of the mean velocity gradient is $\\frac{\\partial U_1}{\\partial x_2} = \\frac{dU}{dy}$. The production term simplifies significantly to:\n$$\nP_k = -\\overline{u'_1 u'_2} \\frac{dU}{dy}\n$$\nwhere $-\\overline{u'_1 u'_2}$ (often written as $-\\overline{u'v'}$) is the dominant Reynolds shear stress component.\n\nThe problem states that the Boussinesq eddy viscosity closure is used. This hypothesis models the Reynolds shear stress per unit mass as being proportional to the mean rate of strain:\n$$\n-\\overline{u'_1 u'_2} = \\nu_t \\frac{dU}{dy}\n$$\nwhere $\\nu_t$ is the eddy viscosity. Substituting this into the expression for $P_k$, we obtain:\n$$\nP_k = \\left(\\nu_t \\frac{dU}{dy}\\right) \\frac{dU}{dy} = \\nu_t \\left(\\frac{dU}{dy}\\right)^2\n$$\nTo find $P_k$, we first need to determine the expressions for the mean velocity gradient $\\frac{dU}{dy}$ and the eddy viscosity $\\nu_t$ in the logarithmic layer, based on the provided relations.\n\nFirst, we derive the mean velocity gradient $\\frac{dU}{dy}$. The problem provides the law of the wall in dimensionless form:\n$$\nU^{+}(y^{+}) = \\frac{1}{\\kappa} \\ln(y^{+}) + B\n$$\nWe convert this to dimensional form using the definitions $U^{+} = U/u_{\\tau}$ and $y^{+} = y u_{\\tau}/\\nu$:\n$$\n\\frac{U(y)}{u_{\\tau}} = \\frac{1}{\\kappa} \\ln\\left(\\frac{y u_{\\tau}}{\\nu}\\right) + B\n$$\nSolving for $U(y)$:\n$$\nU(y) = u_{\\tau} \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\kappa} \\ln\\left(\\frac{y u_{\\tau}}{\\nu}\\right) + B \\right]\n$$\nTo find the gradient, we differentiate $U(y)$ with respect to $y$:\n$$\n\\frac{dU}{dy} = \\frac{d}{dy} \\left( u_{\\tau} \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\kappa} \\ln(y) + \\frac{1}{\\kappa} \\ln\\left(\\frac{u_{\\tau}}{\\nu}\\right) + B \\right] \\right)\n$$\nThe terms $\\frac{1}{\\kappa} \\ln\\left(\\frac{u_{\\tau}}{\\nu}\\right)$ and $B$ are constant with respect to $y$. Therefore, the differentiation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{dU}{dy} = u_{\\tau} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\kappa} \\frac{1}{y} \\right) = \\frac{u_{\\tau}}{\\kappa y}\n$$\n\nNext, we derive the eddy viscosity $\\nu_t$. The problem provides the model for $\\nu_t$ and the scalings for $k$ and $\\varepsilon$ in the logarithmic layer:\n$$\n\\nu_{t}(y) = C_{\\mu} \\frac{k(y)^{2}}{\\varepsilon(y)}\n$$\n$$\nk(y) \\approx \\alpha \\, u_{\\tau}^{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon(y) \\approx \\frac{u_{\\tau}^{3}}{\\kappa \\, y}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $k(y)$ and $\\varepsilon(y)$ into the formula for $\\nu_t(y)$:\n$$\n\\nu_t(y) = C_{\\mu} \\frac{(\\alpha \\, u_{\\tau}^{2})^2}{\\frac{u_{\\tau}^{3}}{\\kappa \\, y}} = C_{\\mu} \\frac{\\alpha^2 u_{\\tau}^4}{u_{\\tau}^3/(\\kappa y)}\n$$\nSimplifying this expression gives:\n$$\n\\nu_t(y) = C_{\\mu} \\alpha^2 u_{\\tau}^4 \\left(\\frac{\\kappa y}{u_{\\tau}^3}\\right) = C_{\\mu} \\alpha^2 \\kappa u_{\\tau} y\n$$\n\nFinally, we substitute the derived expressions for $\\nu_t(y)$ and $\\frac{dU}{dy}$ back into the equation for the production rate $P_k$:\n$$\nP_k(y) = \\nu_t \\left(\\frac{dU}{dy}\\right)^2 = (C_{\\mu} \\alpha^2 \\kappa u_{\\tau} y) \\left(\\frac{u_{\\tau}}{\\kappa y}\\right)^2\n$$\nExpanding the squared term:\n$$\nP_k(y) = (C_{\\mu} \\alpha^2 \\kappa u_{\\tau} y) \\left(\\frac{u_{\\tau}^2}{\\kappa^2 y^2}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we combine and simplify the terms:\n$$\nP_k(y) = \\frac{C_{\\mu} \\alpha^2 \\kappa u_{\\tau}^3 y}{\\kappa^2 y^2}\n$$\nCanceling common factors of $\\kappa$ and $y$ from the numerator and denominator, we arrive at the final expression for the production rate of turbulent kinetic energy per unit mass:\n$$\nP_k(y) = \\frac{C_{\\mu} \\alpha^2 u_{\\tau}^3}{\\kappa y}\n$$\nThe units of this expression are $(\\text{dimensionless}) \\cdot (\\text{dimensionless})^2 \\cdot (L/T)^3 / ((\\text{dimensionless}) \\cdot L) = (L^3/T^3)/L = L^2/T^3$, which corresponds to $\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}^3$ as required.",

I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Task 1: Derivation of the friction velocity estimator\n\nThe goal is to derive an estimator for the friction velocity $u_\\tau$ based on the principles of the $k$–$\\varepsilon$ model in the logarithmic layer of a turbulent boundary layer.\n\n1.  We begin with the Boussinesq hypothesis, which relates the dominant component of the Reynolds stress tensor to the mean velocity gradient:\n    $$-\\rho \\overline{u'v'} = \\rho \\nu_t \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}$$\n    In the near-wall region (specifically, the log-layer), the total shear stress is approximately constant and equal to the wall shear stress, $\\tau_w$. The turbulent shear stress dominates the viscous stress, so we can write:\n    $$\\tau_w \\approx -\\rho \\overline{u'v'}$$\n    Using the definition of friction velocity, $u_\\tau = \\sqrt{\\tau_w/\\rho}$, we have:\n    $$u_\\tau^2 \\approx \\nu_t \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}$$\n\n2.  The production rate of turbulent kinetic energy, $P_k$, is given by:\n    $$P_k = \\nu_t \\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}\\right)^2$$\n    We can substitute the expression for the velocity gradient, $\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y} \\approx \\frac{u_\\tau^2}{\\nu_t}$, from the previous step into the production term:\n    $$P_k \\approx \\nu_t \\left(\\frac{u_\\tau^2}{\\nu_t}\\right)^2 = \\frac{u_\\tau^4}{\\nu_t}$$\n\n3.  The eddy viscosity, $\\nu_t$, is itself modeled in terms of $k$ and $\\varepsilon$ as:\n    $$\\nu_t = C_\\mu \\frac{k^2}{\\varepsilon}$$\n    Substituting this into our expression for $P_k$:\n    $$P_k \\approx \\frac{u_\\tau^4}{C_\\mu k^2 / \\varepsilon} = \\frac{u_\\tau^4 \\varepsilon}{C_\\mu k^2}$$\n\n4.  Now we must relate production $P_k$ to dissipation $\\varepsilon$. The problem states we should use the \"equilibrium balance...in the $k$-equation, together with the functional role of $C_{\\epsilon 1}$ and $C_{\\epsilon 2}$\". The standard $k$-equation equilibrium assumption is $P_k \\approx \\varepsilon$. However, using this would lead to an estimator for $u_\\tau$ that is independent of $C_{\\epsilon 1}$ and $C_{\\epsilon 2}$, which contradicts the problem's requirement. The phrase \"together with\" implies that the relationship between $P_k$ and $\\varepsilon$ must be consistent with the $\\varepsilon$-equation's structure. In a local equilibrium state where transport terms in the $\\varepsilon$-equation are neglected, its production and destruction terms must balance:\n    $$C_{\\epsilon 1} \\frac{\\varepsilon}{k} P_k \\approx C_{\\epsilon 2} \\frac{\\varepsilon^2}{k}$$\n    This simplifies to a relationship between production and dissipation that is intrinsic to the $\\varepsilon$-equation's formulation:\n    $$P_k \\approx \\frac{C_{\\epsilon 2}}{C_{\\epsilon 1}} \\varepsilon$$\n    This is the crucial assumption for this derivation, as it incorporates the required constants.\n\n5.  Finally, we equate the two expressions for $P_k$ derived in steps 3 and 4:\n    $$\\frac{u_\\tau^4 \\varepsilon}{C_\\mu k^2} \\approx \\frac{C_{\\epsilon 2}}{C_{\\epsilon 1}} \\varepsilon$$\n    The dissipation rate $\\varepsilon$ cancels from both sides, yielding:\n    $$u_\\tau^4 \\approx C_\\mu \\frac{C_{\\epsilon 2}}{C_{\\epsilon 1}} k^2$$\n    Taking the fourth root gives the desired estimator for the friction velocity:\n    $$u_\\tau \\approx \\left(C_\\mu \\frac{C_{\\epsilon 2}}{C_{\\epsilon 1}}\\right)^{1/4} k^{1/2}$$\n\n### Task 2: Sensitivity Analysis\n\n1.  The skin friction coefficient $C_f$ is defined as:\n    $$C_f = 2 \\left(\\frac{u_\\tau}{U_\\infty}\\right)^2$$\n    Substituting our estimator for $u_\\tau$:\n    $$C_f \\approx 2 \\frac{1}{U_\\infty^2} \\left[ \\left(C_\\mu \\frac{C_{\\epsilon 2}}{C_{\\epsilon 1}}\\right)^{1/4} k^{1/2} \\right]^2 = 2 \\frac{1}{U_\\infty^2} \\left(C_\\mu \\frac{C_{\\epsilon 2}}{C_{\\epsilon 1}}\\right)^{1/2} k$$\n    This expression can be rewritten as:\n    $$C_f \\approx \\left(\\frac{2k}{U_\\infty^2} \\sqrt{\\frac{C_\\mu}{C_{\\epsilon 1}}}\\right) \\sqrt{C_{\\epsilon 2}}$$\n\n2.  To analyze the sensitivity of $C_f$ to small perturbations in $C_{\\epsilon 2}$, we compute the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial C_f}{\\partial C_{\\epsilon 2}}$. Treating all other parameters as constants, let the term in parenthesis be a constant $A$:\n    $$A = \\frac{2k}{U_\\infty^2} \\sqrt{\\frac{C_\\mu}{C_{\\epsilon 1}}}$$\n    Then $C_f = A \\sqrt{C_{\\epsilon 2}}$. The derivative is:\n    $$\\frac{\\partial C_f}{\\partial C_{\\epsilon 2}} = A \\cdot \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{C_{\\epsilon 2}}} = \\left(\\frac{2k}{U_\\infty^2} \\sqrt{\\frac{C_\\mu}{C_{\\epsilon 1}}}\\right) \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{C_{\\epsilon 2}}} = \\frac{k}{U_\\infty^2} \\sqrt{\\frac{C_\\mu}{C_{\\epsilon 1} C_{\\epsilon 2}}}$$\n    Since all quantities ($k$, $U_\\infty$, $C_\\mu$, $C_{\\epsilon 1}$, $C_{\\epsilon 2}$) are positive, the derivative $\\frac{\\partial C_f}{\\partial C_{\\epsilon 2}}$ is strictly positive. This indicates that an increase in the value of $C_{\\epsilon 2}$ leads to a predicted increase in the friction coefficient $C_f$. Physically, $C_{\\epsilon 2}$ governs the dissipation destruction term in the $\\varepsilon$-equation. A larger $C_{\\epsilon 2}$ leads to a lower $\\varepsilon$, which in turn increases the eddy viscosity $\\nu_t = C_\\mu k^2 / \\varepsilon$, leading to higher turbulent shear stress and consequently higher wall friction.\n\n3.  The problem requests the dimensionless relative change, which is defined for a finite perturbation. Let $C_{\\epsilon 2}^{\\mathrm{pert}} = C_{\\epsilon 2}^{\\mathrm{base}} (1 + \\delta)$ be the perturbed value, where $\\delta$ is the fractional change. The relative change in $C_f$ is given by:\n    $$\\frac{C_f^{\\mathrm{pert}}}{C_f^{\\mathrm{base}}} - 1$$\n    Using our derived formula for $C_f$:\n    $$\\frac{C_f^{\\mathrm{pert}}}{C_f^{\\mathrm{base}}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{2k}{U_\\infty^2} \\sqrt{\\frac{C_\\mu}{C_{\\epsilon 1}}}\\right) \\sqrt{C_{\\epsilon 2}^{\\mathrm{pert}}}}{\\left(\\frac{2k}{U_\\infty^2} \\sqrt{\\frac{C_\\mu}{C_{\\epsilon 1}}}\\right) \\sqrt{C_{\\epsilon 2}^{\\mathrm{base}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{C_{\\epsilon 2}^{\\mathrm{pert}}}{C_{\\epsilon 2}^{\\mathrm{base}}}}$$\n    Substituting $C_{\\epsilon 2}^{\\mathrm{pert}} = C_{\\epsilon 2}^{\\mathrm{base}} (1 + \\delta)$:\n    $$\\frac{C_f^{\\mathrm{pert}}}{C_f^{\\mathrm{base}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{C_{\\epsilon 2}^{\\mathrm{base}} (1 + \\delta)}{C_{\\epsilon 2}^{\\mathrm{base}}}} = \\sqrt{1 + \\delta}$$\n    Therefore, the relative change in $C_f$ is:\n    $$\\frac{C_f^{\\mathrm{pert}}}{C_f^{\\mathrm{base}}} - 1 = \\sqrt{1 + \\delta} - 1$$\n    This striking result shows that under the assumptions made, the relative change in the predicted friction coefficient depends only on the relative perturbation $\\delta$ to $C_{\\epsilon 2}$, and is independent of the free-stream velocity $U_\\infty$, the turbulent kinetic energy $k$, and the specific values of the model constants. This simplifies the numerical task significantly. For a small perturbation $\\delta$, a Taylor expansion gives $\\sqrt{1+\\delta} - 1 \\approx (1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\delta) - 1 = \\frac{1}{2}\\delta$, indicating that the relative change in $C_f$ is approximately half the relative change in $C_{\\epsilon 2}$.\n\n### Task 3: Implementation\n\nThe anaylsis shows that the required calculation for each test case simplifies to computing $\\sqrt{1 + \\delta} - 1$ for each given value of $\\delta$. The values of $U_\\infty$ and $k$ are not needed for the final computation, although they were part of the conceptual setup. The program will calculate this value for each perturbation specified in the test suite.",
