Under the standard approximation for many flows, the divergence of the stress tensor is simplified, leading to a form where molecular and eddy viscosities are additive. The modeled RANS equation is commonly written as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\overline{u}_i}{\\partial t} + \\overline{u}_j \\frac{\\partial \\overline{u}_i}{\\partial x_j} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{\\partial \\overline{p}_{mod}}{\\partial x_i} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j} \\left( (\\nu + \\nu_t) \\frac{\\partial \\overline{u}_i}{\\partial x_j} \\right)\n$$\n\nNow, we non-dimensionalize this equation using the characteristic scales: velocity $U$, length $L$, time $L/U$, and pressure $\\rho U^2$. Let the dimensionless variables be denoted by an asterisk:\n$\\overline{u}_i = U \\overline{u}_i^*$, $x_j = L x_j^*$, $t = (L/U) t^*$, and $\\overline{p}_{mod} = \\rho U^2 \\overline{p}_{mod}^*$.\nSubstituting these into the equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial (U \\overline{u}_i^*)}{\\partial ((L/U) t^*)} + (U \\overline{u}_j^*) \\frac{\\partial (U \\overline{u}_i^*)}{\\partial (L x_j^*)} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho} \\frac{\\partial (\\rho U^2 \\overline{p}_{mod}^*)}{\\partial (L x_i^*)} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial (L x_j^*)} \\left( (\\nu + \\nu_t) \\frac{\\partial (U \\overline{u}_i^*)}{\\partial (L x_j^*)} \\right)\n$$\nFactoring out the characteristic scales:\n$$\n\\frac{U^2}{L} \\frac{\\partial \\overline{u}_i^*}{\\partial t^*} + \\frac{U^2}{L} \\overline{u}_j^* \\frac{\\partial \\overline{u}_i^*}{\\partial x_j^*} = -\\frac{U^2}{L} \\frac{\\partial \\overline{p}_{mod}^*}{\\partial x_i^*} + \\frac{U}{L^2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j^*} \\left( (\\nu + \\nu_t) \\frac{\\partial \\overline{u}_i^*}{\\partial x_j^*} \\right)\n$$\nMultiplying the entire equation by $L/U^2$ to make it dimensionless:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\overline{u}_i^*}{\\partial t^*} + \\overline{u}_j^* \\frac{\\partial \\overline{u}_i^*}{\\partial x_j^*} = -\\frac{\\partial \\overline{p}_{mod}^*}{\\partial x_i^*} + \\frac{1}{UL} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j^*} \\left( (\\nu + \\nu_t) \\frac{\\partial \\overline{u}_i^*}{\\partial x_j^*} \\right)\n$$\nWe can bring the $1/(UL)$ factor inside the spatial derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\overline{u}_i^*}{\\partial t^*} + \\overline{u}_j^* \\frac{\\partial \\overline{u}_i^*}{\\partial x_j^*} = -\\frac{\\partial \\overline{p}_{mod}^*}{\\partial x_i^*} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_j^*} \\left[ \\left( \\frac{\\nu}{UL} + \\frac{\\nu_t}{UL} \\right) \\frac{\\partial \\overline{u}_i^*}{\\partial x_j^*} \\right]\n$$\nThe molecular Reynolds number is defined as $Re = UL/\\nu$. In analogy, the term multiplying the modeled turbulent diffusion defines the turbulent Reynolds number, $Re_t$.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{Re} = \\frac{\\nu}{UL} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{1}{Re_t} = \\frac{\\nu_t}{UL}\n$$\nThus, the turbulent Reynolds number is defined as:\n$$\nRe_t = \\frac{UL}{\\nu_t}\n$$\nThe problem specifies a two-equation $k$–$\\epsilon$ closure model, where the eddy viscosity is given by:\n$$\n\\nu_t = C_{\\mu} \\frac{k^2}{\\epsilon}\n$$\nwhere $C_{\\mu}$ is a dimensionless constant, $k$ is the turbulent kinetic energy, and $\\epsilon$ is its dissipation rate. Substituting this into our expression for $Re_t$:\n$$\nRe_t = \\frac{UL}{C_{\\mu} \\frac{k^2}{\\epsilon}} = \\frac{UL\\epsilon}{C_{\\mu} k^2}\n$$\nWe are given the scaling assumptions for $k$ and $\\epsilon$ based on the characteristic scales $U$ and $L$:\n$$\nk \\sim \\alpha U^2\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon \\sim \\beta \\frac{U^3}{L}\n$$\nHere, $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are dimensionless coefficients. We substitute these scaling relations into the expression for $Re_t$:\n$$\nRe_t \\sim \\frac{UL \\left(\\beta \\frac{U^3}{L}\\right)}{C_{\\mu} (\\alpha U^2)^2} = \\frac{\\beta U^4}{C_{\\mu} \\alpha^2 U^4}\n$$\nThe characteristic scales $U$ and $L$ cancel out, yielding the final symbolic expression for $Re_t$:\n$$\nRe_t = \\frac{\\beta}{C_{\\mu} \\alpha^2}\n$$\nNow, we evaluate this expression using the given numerical values: $C_{\\mu} = 0.09$, $\\alpha = 0.30$, and $\\beta = 0.70$.\n$$\nRe_t = \\frac{0.70}{0.09 \\times (0.30)^2} = \\frac{0.70}{0.09 \\times 0.09} = \\frac{0.70}{0.0081}\n$$\nPerforming the calculation:\n$$\nRe_t = 86.419753...\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get $86.42$.",
