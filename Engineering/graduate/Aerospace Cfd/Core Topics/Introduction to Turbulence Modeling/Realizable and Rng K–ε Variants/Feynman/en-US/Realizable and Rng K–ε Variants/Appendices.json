It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. A detailed solution will be provided.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation and Calculation of Turbulent Viscosity $\\nu_t$\n\nThe turbulent (eddy) viscosity, $\\nu_t$, is a concept used in RANS modeling to relate the Reynolds stresses to the mean velocity gradients, analogous to how molecular viscosity relates stress to strain rate in a laminar flow. The standard k–ε model determines $\\nu_t$ from the turbulent kinetic energy, $k$, and its dissipation rate, $\\epsilon$, based on dimensional analysis.\n\nThe turbulent kinetic energy, $k$, has units of velocity squared ($\\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}^{2}$), so a characteristic velocity scale of the large, energy-containing eddies can be defined as $u' \\sim \\sqrt{k}$. The dissipation rate, $\\epsilon$, has units of energy per unit mass per unit time, or $\\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}^{3}$. A characteristic length scale of these eddies, $L$, can be formed by combining $k$ and $\\epsilon$. From dimensional reasoning, we must have $\\epsilon \\sim \\frac{(u')^{3}}{L} \\sim \\frac{k^{3/2}}{L}$. This allows us to define the characteristic length scale as $L \\sim \\frac{k^{3/2}}{\\epsilon}$.\n\nThe eddy viscosity, $\\nu_t$, is modeled as the product of a characteristic turbulent velocity and a characteristic turbulent length scale:\n$$ \\nu_t \\sim u' L $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $u'$ and $L$ in terms of $k$ and $\\epsilon$:\n$$ \\nu_t \\sim (\\sqrt{k}) \\left( \\frac{k^{3/2}}{\\epsilon} \\right) = \\frac{k^2}{\\epsilon} $$\nThe standard k–ε model formalizes this relationship by introducing a dimensionless proportionality constant, $C_{\\mu}$. The final expression for the eddy viscosity is:\n$$ \\nu_t = C_{\\mu} \\frac{k^2}{\\epsilon} $$\nThis expression is central to all two-equation models that use the Boussinesq hypothesis.\n\nUsing the provided numerical values:\n-   $k = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}^{2}$\n-   $\\epsilon = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}^{3}$\n-   $C_{\\mu} = 0.09$\n\nWe compute the turbulent viscosity $\\nu_t$:\n$$ \\nu_t = (0.09) \\frac{(0.5\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}^{2})^2}{0.25\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}^{3}} $$\n$$ \\nu_t = (0.09) \\frac{0.25\\,\\mathrm{m}^{4}/\\mathrm{s}^{4}}{0.25\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}^{3}} $$\n$$ \\nu_t = 0.09\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s} $$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the result is $0.09000\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{s}$.\n\n### Part 2: Derivation of the Realizability Constraint and Discussion\n\nThe Boussinesq hypothesis for an incompressible fluid relates the modeled Reynolds stresses per unit density, $-\\overline{u'_i u'_j}$, to the mean strain rate tensor, $S_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial U_i}{\\partial x_j} + \\frac{\\partial U_j}{\\partial x_i} \\right)$:\n$$ -\\overline{u'_i u'_j} = 2 \\nu_t S_{ij} - \\frac{2}{3} k \\delta_{ij} $$\nwhere $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. The term $-\\frac{2}{3} k \\delta_{ij}$ ensures the trace of the tensor correctly yields $-2k$.\n\nPhysical realizability requires that the modeled Reynolds stresses obey certain mathematical properties of a real correlation tensor. One such property is that the normal stresses must be non-negative: $\\overline{(u'_i)^2} \\ge 0$ for each $i$ (no summation). Another is the Schwarz inequality for any two fluctuating velocity components:\n$$ (\\overline{u'_i u'_j})^2 \\le \\overline{(u'_i)^2} \\overline{(u'_j)^2} $$\nLet us derive a constraint based on the non-negativity of normal stresses. The normal stress components are given by:\n$$ \\overline{(u'_i)^2} = \\frac{2}{3}k - 2\\nu_t S_{ii} \\quad \\text{(no summation over i)} $$\nFor this to be non-negative, we must have $\\frac{2}{3}k \\ge 2\\nu_t S_{ii}$, or $\\nu_t S_{ii} \\le \\frac{1}{3}k$. This constraint is most restrictive for the largest principal strain rate. Let's analyze the problem in the principal-axis frame of the strain-rate tensor $S_{ij}$, where $S_{ij}$ is diagonal with eigenvalues $\\lambda_1$, $\\lambda_2$, $\\lambda_3$. The non-negativity condition becomes $\\frac{2}{3}k - 2\\nu_t \\lambda_i \\ge 0$ for all $i$. This implies:\n$$ \\nu_t \\lambda_{\\max} \\le \\frac{k}{3} $$\nwhere $\\lambda_{\\max}$ is the largest principal strain rate.\n\nFor a simple shear flow, such as that approximated in a boundary layer, $U_1=U_1(x_2)$, $U_2=U_3=0$. The only non-zero components of the strain-rate tensor are $S_{12} = S_{21} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial U_1}{\\partial x_2}$. The principal strain rates are $\\lambda_1 = |\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\partial U_1}{\\partial x_2}| = |S_{12}|$, $\\lambda_2 = -|S_{12}|$, and $\\lambda_3 = 0$. The maximum principal strain rate is $\\lambda_{\\max} = |S_{12}|$.\nTherefore, the realizability constraint becomes:\n$$ \\nu_t |S_{12}| \\le \\frac{k}{3} $$\nSubstituting the expression $\\nu_t = C_{\\mu} \\frac{k^2}{\\epsilon}$:\n$$ \\left( C_{\\mu} \\frac{k^2}{\\epsilon} \\right) |S_{12}| \\le \\frac{k}{3} $$\nFor $k>0$, we can divide by $k$ to obtain the constraint on the mean shear:\n$$ C_{\\mu} \\frac{k}{\\epsilon} |S_{12}| \\le \\frac{1}{3} $$\n\nWith a constant $C_{\\mu}=0.09$, this inequality imposes a strict upper limit on the permissible shear rate for the given turbulence state. For the values in this problem, the limit is:\n$$ (0.09) \\frac{0.5}{0.25} |S_{12}| \\le \\frac{1}{3} \\implies 0.18 |S_{12}| \\le \\frac{1}{3} \\implies |S_{12}| \\le \\frac{1}{0.54} \\approx 1.85\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\nAerospace turbulent boundary layers often feature extremely high mean shear rates, particularly in the near-wall region, where values of $\\frac{\\partial U_1}{\\partial x_2}$ (and thus $S_{12}$) can be on the order of $10^3$ to $10^5\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ or higher. Such values would grossly violate the constraint $|S_{12}| \\le 1.85\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Consequently, the Reynolds stresses implied by the constant-$C_{\\mu}$ eddy viscosity are not physically plausible in regions of moderate-to-strong mean shear. The model would predict unphysical results, such as negative turbulent normal stresses, which is a critical failure.\n\n### Part 3: Realizable and RNG k–ε Model Enhancements\n\nThe Realizable and Renormalization Group (RNG) k–ε variants address this fundamental deficiency by abandoning the assumption of a constant $C_{\\mu}$.\n\n**Realizable k–ε model:** This model is explicitly constructed to satisfy the realizability constraints. It achieves this by making $C_{\\mu}$ a function of the mean flow deformation. Specifically, $C_{\\mu}$ becomes a function of the invariants of the mean strain rate tensor $S_{ij}$ and the mean rotation rate tensor $\\Omega_{ij}$, as well as $k$ and $\\epsilon$. The functional form for $C_{\\mu}$ is designed such that it decreases as the magnitude of the mean strain rate increases. For example, $C_{\\mu} = 1/(A_0 + A_s U^* k/\\epsilon)$, where $U^*$ incorporates the strain and rotation rates. This self-regulating mechanism prevents the product $\\nu_t |S_{ij}|$ from exceeding the physical limit (e.g., $k/3$), thus ensuring that the normal stresses remain non-negative and the Schwarz inequality is satisfied, even in regions of very high shear.\n\n**RNG k–ε model:** This model is derived using a rigorous statistical technique (Renormalization Group theory). The derivation naturally produces a more complex expression for the eddy viscosity that accounts for the effects of mean strain rate. The effective viscosity in the RNG model is sensitive to the dimensionless parameter $\\eta = \\frac{Sk}{\\epsilon}$, where $S = \\sqrt{2 S_{ij} S_{ij}}$ is the modulus of the mean strain rate tensor. The model effectively reduces the eddy viscosity in regions of high strain rate (large $\\eta$). This behavior, while not explicitly designed to enforce realizability in the same way as the Realizable model, has a similar effect of preventing the unphysical growth of Reynolds stresses in high-shear regions. As a result, the RNG model exhibits better performance and physical consistency for flows with strong streamline curvature, stagnation points, and high strain rates compared to the standard k–ε model.\n\nIn summary, both the Realizable and RNG models improve physical plausibility by making the turbulent viscosity sensitive to the mean flow topology, reducing its value in regions of high strain to prevent the violation of fundamental physical principles.",

Reynolds Stress Tensor Calculation**\n\nThe Boussinesq hypothesis for an incompressible flow relates the Reynolds stress tensor, $\\overline{u_{i}' u_{j}'}$, to the mean rate-of-strain tensor, $S_{ij}$, as follows:\n$$ \\overline{u_{i}' u_{j}'} = \\frac{2}{3} k \\delta_{ij} - 2 \\nu_{t} S_{ij} $$\nwhere $k$ is the turbulent kinetic energy, $\\nu_{t}$ is the turbulent (eddy) viscosity, and $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nThe mean rate-of-strain tensor is defined as:\n$$ S_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\overline{u_i}}{\\partial x_j} + \\frac{\\partial \\overline{u_j}}{\\partial x_i} \\right) $$\nThe given mean velocity field is $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{u}} = (\\overline{u_1}, \\overline{u_2}, \\overline{u_3}) = (\\Gamma x_2, 0, 0)$, where we use $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ for $(x, y, z)$.

From the first factor, one eigenvalue is immediately identified:\n    $$ \\lambda_3 = \\frac{2}{3}k $$\n2.  From the second factor in the square brackets:\n    $$ \\left(\\frac{2}{3}k - \\lambda\\right)^2 = (\\nu_{t}\\Gamma)^2 $$\n    Taking the square root of both sides gives:\n    $$ \\frac{2}{3}k - \\lambda = \\pm \\nu_{t}\\Gamma $$\n    $$ \\lambda = \\frac{2}{3}k \\mp \\nu_{t}\\Gamma $$\n    This yields the other two eigenvalues:\n    $$ \\lambda_1 = \\frac{2}{3}k + \\nu_{t}\\Gamma $$\n    $$ \\lambda_2 = \\frac{2}{3}k - \\nu_{t}\\Gamma $$\n\nThe three eigenvalues of the Reynolds stress tensor are $\\frac{2}{3}k + \\nu_{t}\\Gamma$, $\\frac{2}{3}k - \\nu_{t}\\Gamma$, and $\\frac{2}{3}k$. Since $\\nu_{t} > 0$ and $\\Gamma > 0$, the term $\\nu_{t}\\Gamma$ is positive. Therefore, the minimum eigenvalue is $\\lambda_{\\min} = \\frac{2}{3}k - \\nu_{t}\\Gamma$.\n\n**3. Numerical Calculation of the Minimum Eigenvalue**\n\nUsing the given data: $k = 1.0 \\, \\mathrm{m^2 s^{-2}}$, $\\nu_t = 0.02 \\, \\mathrm{m^2 s^{-1}}$, and $\\Gamma = 20 \\, \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n$$ \\lambda_{\\min} = \\frac{2}{3}(1.0) - (0.02)(20) $$\n$$ \\lambda_{\\min} = \\frac{2}{3} - 0.4 $$\n$$ \\lambda_{\\min} = 0.6666\\overline{6} - 0.4 = 0.2666\\overline{6} \\, \\mathrm{m^2 s^{-2}} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the minimum eigenvalue is $0.2667 \\, \\mathrm{m^2 s^{-2}}$.\n\n**4. Realizability in Realizable and RNG k–ε Models**\n\nThe principle of realizability requires that the Reynolds stress tensor be positive semi-definite, which mathematically translates to all of its eigenvalues being non-negative. For the simple shear flow, this imposes the constraint $\\lambda_{\\min} \\ge 0$:\n$$ \\frac{2}{3}k - \\nu_{t}\\Gamma \\ge 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\nu_{t} \\le \\frac{2k}{3\\Gamma} $$\nThe standard k–ε model, which uses a constant coefficient $C_{\\mu} = 0.09$ in the eddy viscosity formula $\\nu_t = C_{\\mu} \\frac{k^2}{\\epsilon}$, can violate this condition in regions of high shear rate magnitude $\\Gamma$, leading to unphysical negative eigenvalues (i.e., negative normal stresses in the principal-axis coordinate system).\n\nBoth the Realizable and RNG k–ε models overcome this deficiency by modifying the formulation for the eddy viscosity.\n\n-   **Realizable k–ε Model:**\n    This class of models (e.g., Shih et al., 1995) enforces realizability by making the coefficient $C_{\\mu}$ a function of the mean flow deformation and turbulence properties. The functional form for $C_{\\mu}$ is derived from fundamental physical constraints, such as the Schwarz inequality on the Reynolds stresses. For simple shear, $C_{\\mu}$ becomes a function of the dimensionless strain rate parameter $S k / \\epsilon$, where $S = \\Gamma$. The function is designed such that as the strain rate $\\Gamma$ increases, the value of $C_{\\mu}$ decreases appropriately. This adaptive behavior prevents $\\nu_t = C_{\\mu} \\frac{k^2}{\\epsilon}$ from becoming excessively large and ensures that the inequality $\\nu_t \\le \\frac{2k}{3\\Gamma}$ is always satisfied. Thus, the non-negativity of the eigenvalues is guaranteed by construction.\n\n-   **RNG k–ε Model:**\n    The Renormalization Group (RNG) model (Yakhot & Orszag, 1986) also achieves realizability but through a different theoretical derivation. The model introduces a term in the $\\epsilon$ transport equation and modifies the eddy viscosity formula to account for the effects of high strain rates. The effective viscosity is systematically reduced in regions where the mean strain rate is large compared to the turbulence timescale. This is often expressed through an algebraic relation where the effective eddy viscosity depends on the strain rate parameter $\\eta = S k / \\epsilon$. As $\\eta$ increases, the formulation naturally reduces the eddy viscosity, effectively acting as a \"strain-damping\" mechanism. This prevents $\\nu_t$ from exceeding its realizability limit, thus ensuring the Reynolds stress eigenvalues remain non-negative even under conditions of very high shear.\n\nIn summary, both models abandon the constant $C_{\\mu}$ assumption of the standard model and instead compute an effective turbulent viscosity that is sensitized to the local mean flow strain rate. This built-in feedback mechanism ensures that the Boussinesq model prediction for the Reynolds stress tensor remains physically and mathematically realizable.",

The following well-tested facts form the fundamental base of your derivation: the law of the wall $U^+ = \\frac{1}{\\kappa} \\ln y^+ + B$, the equilibrium condition $P \\approx \\epsilon$ in the log layer, the turbulent shear dominance $1 \\approx \\nu_t^+ \\frac{dU^+}{dy^+}$, and the eddy-viscosity closure $\\nu_t = C_\\mu \\frac{k^2}{\\epsilon}$.\n\nDefine the model coefficient $C_\\mu(\\eta)$ for three cases:\n- Baseline constant case: $C_{\\mu,0} = 0.09$ (constant).\n- Realizable-like variable case: $C_{\\mu,\\text{real}}(\\eta) = C_{\\mu,0} \\frac{1 + a \\eta}{1 + b \\eta}$ with $a = 0.2$ and $b = 0.5$.\n- Renormalization Group (RNG)-like variable case: $C_{\\mu,\\text{rng}}(\\eta) = C_{\\mu,0} \\left(1 - \\gamma e^{-\\eta/\\eta_0}\\right)$ with $\\gamma = 0.4$ and $\\eta_0 = 0.1$.\n\nFrom the fundamental base stated above, develop an algorithm to compute $k^+(y^+)$ and $\\epsilon^+(y^+)$ profiles for a prescribed set of physical parameters $(u_\\tau, \\nu, \\delta)$ and a specified $C_\\mu(\\eta)$ variant. Your program must:\n1. Use $\\kappa = 0.41$ and $B = 5.2$.\n2. Construct a uniform grid in viscous units $y^+$ spanning the log layer with integer points from $y^+ = 30$ to $y^+ = 300$ inclusive.\n3. Map each $y^+$ to physical $y$ via $y = y^+ \\nu / u_\\tau$, and then to $\\eta = y/\\delta$.\n4. Using only the fundamental base relations above, compute $\\frac{dU^+}{dy^+}$, $\\nu_t^+(y^+)$, $\\epsilon^+(y^+)$, and $k^+(y^+)$ for each specified $C_\\mu(\\eta)$ variant.\n\nTo quantify deviations introduced by variable $C_\\mu(\\eta)$, for each test case compute the root-mean-square fractional deviations of $k^+$ and $\\epsilon^+$ relative to the baseline constant-$C_\\mu$ case over the $y^+$ grid. Specifically, for a quantity $q^+(y^+)$, define the fractional deviation field as $\\Delta q^+(y^+) = \\frac{q^+_{\\text{var}}(y^+) - q^+_{\\text{const}}(y^+)}{q^+_{\\text{const}}(y^+)}$, and report the metric $\\left(\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\left[\\Delta q^+(y^+_i)\\right]^2\\right)^{1/2}$ where $N$ is the number of grid points and $q^+_{\\text{var}}$ is the profile computed with the specified variable $C_\\mu(\\eta)$.\n\nUse the following test suite of parameter sets, all in International System of Units (SI):\n- Case $1$: $(u_\\tau, \\nu, \\delta) = (0.5\\,\\text{m/s}, 1.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{m}^2/\\text{s}, 0.05\\,\\text{m})$, realizable-like $C_\\mu(\\eta)$.\n- Case $2$: $(u_\\tau, \\nu, \\delta) = (0.35\\,\\text{m/s}, 1.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{m}^2/\\text{s}, 0.02\\,\\text{m})$, RNG-like $C_\\mu(\\eta)$.\n- Case $3$: $(u_\\tau, \\nu, \\delta) = (0.65\\,\\text{m/s}, 1.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{m}^2/\\text{s}, 0.005\\,\\text{m})$, realizable-like $C_\\mu(\\eta)$.\n- Case $4$: $(u_\\tau, \\nu, \\delta) = (0.45\\,\\text{m/s}, 1.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{m}^2/\\text{s}, 0.15\\,\\text{m})$, RNG-like $C_\\mu(\\eta)$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, ordered as $\\left[\\text{RMS deviation of }k^+\\text{ for Case }1,\\text{RMS deviation of }\\epsilon^+\\text{ for Case }1,\\ldots,\\text{RMS deviation of }k^+\\text{ for Case }4,\\text{RMS deviation of }\\epsilon^+\\text{ for Case }4\\right]$, with each float rounded to six decimal places. All reported quantities are nondimensional (unitless); express each result as a decimal.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and computation of nondimensional turbulent kinetic energy profiles, $k^+(y^+)$, and turbulent dissipation rate profiles, $\\epsilon^+(y^+)$, for a turbulent boundary layer. The derivation must be based on a specific set of fundamental relations valid in the logarithmic layer of the flow. We are then asked to compute the root-mean-square (RMS) fractional deviation of these quantities for two variable-$C_\\mu$ models relative to a baseline constant-$C_\\mu$ model.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from the following four fundamental relations provided in the problem statement for the fully developed, zero-pressure-gradient, incompressible turbulent boundary layer in the log-layer equilibrium range:\n1.  Law of the wall for mean velocity: $U^+ = \\frac{1}{\\kappa} \\ln y^+ + B$\n2.  Turbulent shear dominance: $1 \\approx \\nu_t^+ \\frac{dU^+}{dy^+}$\n3.  Production-dissipation equilibrium: $P \\approx \\epsilon$, which in nondimensional form is $P^+ \\approx \\epsilon^+$\n4.  Eddy-viscosity closure: $\\nu_t = C_\\mu \\frac{k^2}{\\epsilon}$, which in nondimensional form is $\\nu_t^+ = C_\\mu \\frac{(k^+)^2}{\\epsilon^+}$\n\nWe will now derive expressions for the required quantities step-by-step. All quantities are in viscous wall units.\n\n**Step 1: Mean Velocity Gradient, $\\frac{dU^+}{dy^+}$**\nDifferentiating the law of the wall (relation 1) with respect to $y^+$ yields the mean velocity gradient:\n$$\n\\frac{dU^+}{dy^+} = \\frac{d}{dy^+} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\kappa} \\ln y^+ + B \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\kappa y^+}\n$$\nHere, $\\kappa = 0.41$ is the Kármán constant.\n\n**Step 2: Nondimensional Eddy Viscosity, $\\nu_t^+$**\nUsing the turbulent shear dominance assumption (relation 2) and the result from Step 1:\n$$\n\\nu_t^+ \\frac{dU^+}{dy^+} \\approx 1 \\implies \\nu_t^+ \\left( \\frac{1}{\\kappa y^+} \\right) \\approx 1\n$$\nSolving for the nondimensional eddy viscosity, we find:\n$$\n\\nu_t^+ \\approx \\kappa y^+\n$$\nThis result indicates that within the log layer, the eddy viscosity increases linearly with distance from the wall, a classical result of mixing-length theory. This expression is independent of the model for $C_\\mu$.\n\n**Step 3: Nondimensional Turbulent Dissipation Rate, $\\epsilon^+$**\nThe production of turbulent kinetic energy, $P$, is given by $P = -\\overline{u'v'} \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial y}$. In wall units, using the eddy viscosity hypothesis $(-\\overline{u'v'}^+ = \\nu_t^+ \\frac{dU^+}{dy^+})$, the nondimensional production $P^+$ is:\n$$\nP^+ = \\left( \\nu_t^+ \\frac{dU^+}{dy^+} \\right) \\frac{dU^+}{dy^+} = \\nu_t^+ \\left( \\frac{dU^+}{dy^+} \\right)^2\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\nu_t^+$ and $\\frac{dU^+}{dy^+}$ from Step 1 and Step 2:\n$$\nP^+ = (\\kappa y^+) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\kappa y^+} \\right)^2 = \\frac{\\kappa y^+}{\\kappa^2 (y^+)^2} = \\frac{1}{\\kappa y^+}\n$$\nThe production-dissipation equilibrium assumption (relation 3), $P^+ \\approx \\epsilon^+$, directly gives the expression for the nondimensional dissipation rate:\n$$\n\\epsilon^+ \\approx \\frac{1}{\\kappa y^+}\n$$\nCritically, this expression for $\\epsilon^+$ depends only on $\\kappa$ and $y^+$. It is entirely independent of the coefficient $C_\\mu$. Therefore, the computed profile $\\epsilon^+(y^+)$ will be identical for the baseline constant-$C_\\mu$ case and the variable-$C_\\mu$ cases.\n\n**Step 4: Nondimensional Turbulent Kinetic Energy, $k^+$**\nWe now use the eddy-viscosity closure (relation 4) to solve for $k^+$:\n$$\n\\nu_t^+ = C_\\mu(\\eta) \\frac{(k^+)^2}{\\epsilon^+}\n$$\nRearranging to solve for $k^+$:\n$$\nk^+ = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu_t^+ \\epsilon^+}{C_\\mu(\\eta)}}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for $\\nu_t^+$ (from Step 2) and $\\epsilon^+$ (from Step 3):\n$$\nk^+ = \\sqrt{\\frac{(\\kappa y^+) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\kappa y^+} \\right)}{C_\\mu(\\eta)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{C_\\mu(\\eta)}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{C_\\mu(\\eta)}}\n$$\nThis result shows that, under the specified equilibrium assumptions, the local turbulent kinetic energy is determined solely by the local value of the model coefficient $C_\\mu$.\n\n**Step 5: Deviation Metrics**\nThe problem requires the calculation of the RMS fractional deviation for a quantity $q^+$:\n$$\n\\text{RMS}_q = \\left(\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\left[\\Delta q^+(y^+_i)\\right]^2\\right)^{1/2} \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\Delta q^+(y^+) = \\frac{q^+_{\\text{var}}(y^+) - q^+_{\\text{const}}(y^+)}{q^+_{\\text{const}}(y^+)}\n$$\nFor the dissipation rate $\\epsilon^+$:\nSince $\\epsilon^+_{\\text{var}}(y^+) = \\epsilon^+_{\\text{const}}(y^+) = \\frac{1}{\\kappa y^+}$, the fractional deviation $\\Delta \\epsilon^+(y^+)$ is identically zero for all $y^+$. Consequently, the RMS deviation for $\\epsilon^+$ is always $0$.\n$$\n\\text{RMS}_{\\epsilon} = 0\n$$\nFor the turbulent kinetic energy $k^+$:\nThe baseline profile is $k^+_{\\text{const}} = 1/\\sqrt{C_{\\mu,0}}$, where $C_{\\mu,0} = 0.09$. The variable profile is $k^+_{\\text{var}}(y^+) = 1/\\sqrt{C_{\\mu,\\text{var}}(\\eta(y^+))}$. The fractional deviation is:\n$$\n\\Delta k^+(y^+) = \\frac{1/\\sqrt{C_{\\mu,\\text{var}}(\\eta)} - 1/\\sqrt{C_{\\mu,0}}}{1/\\sqrt{C_{\\mu,0}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{C_{\\mu,0}}}{\\sqrt{C_{\\mu,\\text{var}}(\\eta)}} - 1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{C_{\\mu,0}}{C_{\\mu,\\text{var}}(\\eta)}} - 1\n$$\nThe value of $C_{\\mu,\\text{var}}(\\eta)$ depends on the outer-layer similarity coordinate $\\eta = y/\\delta$. We relate $\\eta$ to the computational coordinate $y^+$ via the physical parameters of each test case:\n$$\ny = \\frac{y^+ \\nu}{u_\\tau} \\implies \\eta = \\frac{y}{\\delta} = \\left(\\frac{\\nu}{u_\\tau \\delta}\\right) y^+\n$$\n\n**Computational Algorithm**\nFor each test case defined by $(u_\\tau, \\nu, \\delta)$ and a specific variable-$C_\\mu$ model, the following procedure is executed:\n1.  Define the constants: $\\kappa=0.41$, $C_{\\mu,0}=0.09$, and model-specific parameters $(a, b)$ or $(\\gamma, \\eta_0)$.\n2.  Define the computational grid for $y^+$ from $30$ to $300$ inclusive. Let $N$ be the number of points on this grid.\n3.  Calculate the constant factor for the coordinate mapping: $C_{\\eta} = \\frac{\\nu}{u_\\tau \\delta}$.\n4.  Initialize a sum-of-squares variable, $S_k = 0$.\n5.  Iterate through each point $y^+_i$ on the grid:\n    a. Compute $\\eta_i = C_{\\eta} \\cdot y^+_i$.\n    b. Compute $C_{\\mu,\\text{var}}(\\eta_i)$ using the specified realizable-like or RNG-like formula.\n    c. Compute the fractional deviation $\\Delta k^+_i = \\sqrt{C_{\\mu,0} / C_{\\mu,\\text{var}}(\\eta_i)} - 1$.\n    d. Accumulate the square of the deviation: $S_k = S_k + (\\Delta k^+_i)^2$.\n6.  Calculate the RMS deviation for $k^+$: $\\text{RMS}_k = \\sqrt{S_k / N}$.\n7.  The RMS deviation for $\\epsilon^+$ is $\\text{RMS}_{\\epsilon} = 0$.\n8.  Store the pair $(\\text{RMS}_k, \\text{RMS}_{\\epsilon})$ for the current test case.\n9.  Repeat for all test cases and format the final results as a single list.",
