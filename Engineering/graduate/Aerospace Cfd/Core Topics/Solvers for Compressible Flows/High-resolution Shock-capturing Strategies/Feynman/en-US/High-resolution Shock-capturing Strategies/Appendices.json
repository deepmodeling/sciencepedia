            "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional scalar conservation law in the context of aerospace computational fluid dynamics (CFD), where high-resolution shock-capturing (HRSC) strategies rely on accurate propagation speeds of discontinuities. Let the conserved quantity be denoted by $u(x,t)$ and the flux function be denoted by $f(u)$, and consider the partial differential equation $u_{t} + \\partial_{x} f(u) = 0$. Suppose the initial data consist of a Riemann-type discontinuity with constant left state $u_{L}$ for $x  0$ and constant right state $u_{R}$ for $x  0$. A single shock forms and propagates with speed $s$, which is assumed to be constant in time for this self-similar configuration. Starting from the integral conservation statement applied to a control volume that straddles the moving discontinuity, derive the jump relation that enforces conservation across the shock, and from it obtain a closed-form expression for the shock speed $s$ in terms of $u_{L}$, $u_{R}$, and $f(u)$. Then, interpret the conservation law as Burgers’ equation with $f(u) = \\frac{u^{2}}{2}$ and compute the resulting shock speed $s$ in terms of $u_{L}$ and $u_{R}$. Express the final answer as a single analytic expression for $s$. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the theory of hyperbolic conservation laws, a fundamental topic in computational fluidynamics. It is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive the requested expressions.\n\nWe are tasked with deriving the propagation speed $s$ of a shock discontinuity for a scalar conservation law, and then applying the result to Burgers' equation. The starting point is the integral form of the conservation law, which is more fundamental than the partial differential equation as it holds even for weak solutions involving discontinuities.\n\nThe conservation law is given in differential form as:\n$$\nu_{t} + \\partial_{x} f(u) = 0\n$$\nwhere $u(x,t)$ is the conserved quantity and $f(u)$ is the flux function. The integral form of this law states that for any fixed spatial interval $[x_1, x_2]$, the rate of change of the total amount of $u$ within the interval is equal to the net flux across its boundaries:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} u(x,t) \\, dx = f(u(x_1,t)) - f(u(x_2,t))\n$$\nWe consider a single shock discontinuity propagating at a constant speed $s$. The position of the shock at time $t$ is $x_s(t) = s t$. The solution $u(x,t)$ is piecewise constant, defined by the initial Riemann data:\n$$\nu(x,t) = \\begin{cases} u_{L}  \\text{if } x  s t \\\\ u_{R}  \\text{if } x  s t \\end{cases}\n$$\nwhere $u_{L}$ and $u_{R}$ are constants.\n\nTo derive the relationship that must hold across this discontinuity, we apply the integral conservation law to a control volume $[x_1, x_2]$ that is fixed in space and contains the shock at all times of interest. Let us choose $x_1$ and $x_2$ such that $x_1  s t  x_2$ for the time interval being considered.\n\nThe total amount of the conserved quantity $u$ in the interval $[x_1, x_2]$ at time $t$ is:\n$$\n\\int_{x_1}^{x_2} u(x,t) \\, dx = \\int_{x_1}^{st} u_{L} \\, dx + \\int_{st}^{x_2} u_{R} \\, dx\n$$\nEvaluating the integrals, we get:\n$$\n\\int_{x_1}^{x_2} u(x,t) \\, dx = u_{L} [st - x_1] + u_{R} [x_2 - st] = s t (u_{L} - u_{R}) + u_{R} x_2 - u_{L} x_1\n$$\nNow we compute the left-hand side of the integral conservation law, which is the time derivative of this quantity. Since $u_L$, $u_R$, $x_1$, and $x_2$ are constants, the derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{x_1}^{x_2} u(x,t) \\, dx = \\frac{d}{dt} [s t (u_{L} - u_{R}) + u_{R} x_2 - u_{L} x_1] = s (u_{L} - u_{R})\n$$\nNext, we evaluate the right-hand side of the integral conservation law. Since $x_1$ is to the left of the shock and $x_2$ is to the right, we have $u(x_1,t) = u_L$ and $u(x_2,t) = u_R$. The fluxes are therefore constant in time: $f(u(x_1,t)) = f(u_L)$ and $f(u(x_2,t)) = f(u_R)$. The right-hand side is:\n$$\nf(u(x_1,t)) - f(u(x_2,t)) = f(u_L) - f(u_R)\n$$\nEquating the left-hand side and the right-hand side enforces the conservation principle across the moving shock:\n$$\ns (u_{L} - u_{R}) = f(u_L) - f(u_R)\n$$\nThis is the celebrated Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition. We can now solve for the shock speed $s$. Provided that a shock exists (i.e., $u_{L} \\neq u_{R}$), we can divide by $(u_{L} - u_{R})$ to obtain a closed-form expression for $s$:\n$$\ns = \\frac{f(u_L) - f(u_R)}{u_{L} - u_{R}}\n$$\nThis expression can be written compactly using the jump notation $[[q]] = q_L - q_R$, as $s = \\frac{[[f(u)]]}{[[u]]}$.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires us to apply this general result to Burgers' equation. For Burgers' equation, the flux function is given by:\n$$\nf(u) = \\frac{u^2}{2}\n$$\nWe substitute this specific flux function into our derived expression for the shock speed $s$. The fluxes corresponding to the left and right states are:\n$$\nf(u_L) = \\frac{u_L^2}{2} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad f(u_R) = \\frac{u_R^2}{2}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the formula for $s$:\n$$\ns = \\frac{\\frac{u_L^2}{2} - \\frac{u_R^2}{2}}{u_{L} - u_{R}}\n$$\nWe can simplify this expression by factoring the numerator, which is a difference of squares:\n$$\ns = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} (u_L^2 - u_R^2)}{u_{L} - u_{R}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} (u_{L} - u_{R})(u_{L} + u_{R})}{u_{L} - u_{R}}\n$$\nSince $u_{L} \\neq u_{R}$, the term $(u_{L} - u_{R})$ is non-zero and can be cancelled from the numerator and denominator. This yields the final expression for the shock speed for Burgers' equation:\n$$\ns = \\frac{u_{L} + u_{R}}{2}\n$$\nThis result shows that for Burgers' equation, a shock wave propagates at a speed equal to the arithmetic mean of the characteristic speeds, $f'(u)=u$, on either side of the discontinuity.",

For $r_{i} \\approx 0.34457916$,\n$$\n\\min(2r_{i}, 1) = \\min(0.68915832, 1) = 0.68915832,\\quad \\min(r_{i}, 2) = 0.34457916,\n$$\nso $\\phi_{\\mathrm{sb}} \\approx \\max(0, 0.68915832, 0.34457916) = 0.68915832$. Hence\n$$\ns_{i}^{\\mathrm{sb}} \\approx 0.68915832 \\times 2.8407904 \\approx 1.95772.\n$$\nRelative error:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{sb}} \\approx \\frac{|1.95772 - 1.941611|}{1.941611} \\approx 0.0083.\n$$\n\nBy the “without ringing” criterion $E \\leq 0.20$, the minmod and van Leer limiters do not satisfy the criterion (since $E_{\\mathrm{mm}} \\approx 0.4958$ and $E_{\\mathrm{vl}} \\approx 0.2501$), while the Monotonized Central and superbee limiters do satisfy it (since $E_{\\mathrm{mc}} \\approx 0.0165$ and $E_{\\mathrm{sb}} \\approx 0.0083$).\n\nTask 2: Discontinuity region.\n\nGiven $u_{-1} = 0.20$, $u_{0} = 0.40$, $u_{1} = 1.00$, we compute\n\n$$\nr_{0} = \\frac{u_{1} - u_{0}}{u_{0} - u_{-1}} = \\frac{1.00 - 0.40}{0.40 - 0.20} = \\frac{0.60}{0.20} = 3.0,\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n\\frac{u_{0} - u_{-1}}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{0.40 - 0.20}{0.05} = \\frac{0.20}{0.05} = 4.0.\n$$\n\nThus $s_{0} = \\phi(r_{0}) \\times 4.0$. For each limiter:\n\n- Minmod: $\\phi_{\\mathrm{mm}}(3.0) = \\min(1, 3.0) = 1.0 \\Rightarrow s_{0}^{\\mathrm{mm}} = 1.0 \\times 4.0 = 4.0$.\n\n- Van Leer: $\\phi_{\\mathrm{vl}}(3.0) = \\dfrac{2 \\cdot 3.0}{1 + 3.0} = \\dfrac{6.0}{4.0} = 1.5 \\Rightarrow s_{0}^{\\mathrm{vl}} = 1.5 \\times 4.0 = 6.0$.\n\n- Monotonized Central: $\\phi_{\\mathrm{mc}}(3.0) = \\min\\!\\left(\\dfrac{1 + 3.0}{2}, 2, 2 \\cdot 3.0\\right) = \\min(2.0, 2, 6.0) = 2.0 \\Rightarrow s_{0}^{\\mathrm{mc}} = 2.0 \\times 4.0 = 8.0$.\n\n- Superbee: $\\phi_{\\mathrm{sb}}(3.0) = \\max\\!\\left(\\min(2 \\cdot 3.0, 1), \\min(3.0, 2)\\right) = \\max(1.0, 2.0) = 2.0 \\Rightarrow s_{0}^{\\mathrm{sb}} = 2.0 \\times 4.0 = 8.0$.\n\nSelection.\n\nAmong the limiters satisfying $E \\leq 0.20$ in the smooth region, we have the Monotonized Central and superbee limiters. Their discontinuity-region slopes are $s_{0}^{\\mathrm{mc}} = 8.0$ and $s_{0}^{\\mathrm{sb}} = 8.0$, which tie for the largest value. The tie is broken by the smaller smooth-region error, with $E_{\\mathrm{sb}} \\approx 0.0083$ and $E_{\\mathrm{mc}} \\approx 0.0165$. Therefore, the selected limiter is the superbee limiter, which corresponds to index $4$.",
