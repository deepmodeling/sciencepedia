This first exercise breaks down the total flux vector into its two fundamental parts: a convective component, which represents the transport of mass, momentum, and energy by the flow itself, and a pressure component, which represents the force exerted by pressure. Mastering this basic decomposition for a simple uniform flow is the essential first step to understanding how these components are handled at a complex flow interface. ",

The problem is structured to lead to a unique solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, objective mathematical language, free from ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. We may proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Splitting Functions\n\n**Advection Splitting Functions $M^{\\pm}(M)$**\n\nWe are given that $M^{+}(M)$ is a quadratic polynomial, which can be written as $M^{+}(M) = aM^2 + bM + c$. The constraints are:\n1.  $M^{+}(-1) = a - b + c = 0$.\n2.  $M^{+}(1) = a + b + c = 1$.\n3.  The symmetry constraint is $M^{+}(M) = -M^{-}(-M)$. Using the consistency condition $M^{-}(M) = M - M^{+}(M)$, this becomes $M^{+}(M) = - ((-M) - M^{+}(-M)) = M + M^{+}(-M)$, which simplifies to $M^{+}(M) - M^{+}(-M) = M$.\n\nApplying the third constraint to the quadratic form:\n$(aM^2 + bM + c) - (a(-M)^2 + b(-M) + c) = M$\n$(aM^2 + bM + c) - (aM^2 - bM + c) = M$\n$2bM = M$\nThis implies $2b=1$, so $b = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nSubstituting $b = \\frac{1}{2}$ into the first two constraints:\n1.  $a - \\frac{1}{2} + c = 0 \\implies a + c = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n2.  $a + \\frac{1}{2} + c = 1 \\implies a + c = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe constraints are consistent but not sufficient to determine $a$ and $c$ independently.\n\nThe problem asks for the \"simplest nontrivial polynomial\". The standard polynomial splitting in AUSM+-family schemes imposes smoothness conditions. The given condition \"with its zero at $M = -1$\" is satisfied. Interpreting this as a double root to ensure smoothness (i.e., $M^{+'}(-1)=0$) makes the problem unique. A double root at $M=-1$ means $M^{+}(M)$ must be of the form $C(M+1)^2$.\nLet $M^{+}(M) = C(M+1)^2$. This is a quadratic with a zero at $M=-1$.\nUsing the constraint $M^{+}(1) = 1$:\n$C(1+1)^2 = 1 \\implies 4C = 1 \\implies C = \\frac{1}{4}$.\nThus, the advection splitting function is:\n$M^{+}(M) = \\frac{1}{4}(M+1)^2$.\n\nFrom the advection consistency, $M^{-}(M) = M - M^{+}(M)$:\n$M^{-}(M) = M - \\frac{1}{4}(M+1)^2 = M - \\frac{1}{4}(M^2 + 2M + 1) = -\\frac{1}{4}M^2 + \\frac{1}{2}M - \\frac{1}{4} = -\\frac{1}{4}(M^2 - 2M + 1) = -\\frac{1}{4}(M-1)^2$.\n\n**Pressure Splitting Functions $P^{\\pm}(M)$**\n\nWe are given that $P^{+}(M)$ is a cubic polynomial with a double root at $M=-1$. This means $P^{+}(M)$ has the form $k(M-r)(M+1)^2$ for some constants $k$ and $r$.\nThe constraints are:\n1.  $P^{+}(1)=1$.\n2.  The symmetry constraint is $P^{+}(M) = P^{-}(-M)$. Using the consistency condition $P^{-}(M) = 1 - P^{+}(M)$, this becomes $P^{+}(M) = 1 - P^{+}(-M)$, which simplifies to $P^{+}(M) + P^{+}(-M) = 1$.\n\nLet's apply the symmetry constraint to the form $P^{+}(M) = k(M-r)(M+1)^2$:\n$P^{+}(-M) = k(-M-r)(-M+1)^2 = -k(M+r)(M-1)^2$.\nSo, $P^{+}(M) + P^{+}(-M) = k(M-r)(M+1)^2 - k(M+r)(M-1)^2 = 1$.\n$k [ (M-r)(M^2+2M+1) - (M+r)(M^2-2M+1) ] = 1$\n$k [ (M^3+2M^2+M - rM^2-2rM-r) - (M^3-2M^2+M + rM^2-2rM+r) ] = 1$\n$k [ (4-2r)M^2 - 2r ] = 1$.\nFor this equation to hold for all $M$, the coefficient of $M^2$ must be zero, and the constant term must be equal to $1$.\n$4-2r = 0 \\implies r=2$.\n$k(-2r) = 1 \\implies k(-4) = 1 \\implies k = -\\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nThus, the pressure splitting function is:\n$P^{+}(M) = -\\frac{1}{4}(M-2)(M+1)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}(2-M)(M+1)^2$.\nWe check the constraint $P^{+}(1)=1$:\n$P^{+}(1) = \\frac{1}{4}(2-1)(1+1)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}(1)(4) = 1$. The expression is correct.\n\nFrom the pressure consistency, $P^{-}(M) = 1 - P^{+}(M)$:\n$P^{-}(M) = 1 - \\frac{1}{4}(2-M)(M^2+2M+1) = 1 - \\frac{1}{4}(-M^3-2M^2-M+2M^2+4M+2) = 1 - \\frac{1}{4}(-M^3+3M+2) = 1 + \\frac{1}{4}M^3 - \\frac{3}{4}M - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}M^3 - \\frac{3}{4}M + \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n### Calculation of Values\n\nWe need to compute the values of these functions for $M=0.5$ and $M=-0.5$.\n\n**For $M=0.5 = \\frac{1}{2}$:**\n$M^{+}(0.5) = \\frac{1}{4}(\\frac{1}{2}+1)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}(\\frac{3}{2})^2 = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{9}{4} = \\frac{9}{16}$.\n$M^{-}(0.5) = -\\frac{1}{4}(\\frac{1}{2}-1)^2 = -\\frac{1}{4}(-\\frac{1}{2})^2 = -\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = -\\frac{1}{16}$.\nCheck: $M^{+}(0.5) + M^{-}(0.5) = \\frac{9}{16} - \\frac{1}{16} = \\frac{8}{16} = \\frac{1}{2} = M$.

            "solution": "We start from the one-dimensional Euler equations for an ideal gas and write the energy flux in enthalpy form. The total energy per unit volume is $E = \\tfrac{p}{\\gamma - 1} + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\rho u^{2}$, and the total specific enthalpy is $H = \\tfrac{E + p}{\\rho}$. The energy flux can be written as $\\rho H u$, which motivates AUSM’s construction of an advective energy flux from a mass flux and an upwinded enthalpy.\n\nGiven $(\\rho_{L}, u_{L}, p_{L}) = (1, 0, 1)$, $(\\rho_{R}, u_{R}, p_{R}) = (0.125, 0, 0.1)$, and $\\gamma = 1.4$, we compute the speeds of sound:\n$$\na_{L} = \\sqrt{\\gamma\\frac{p_{L}}{\\rho_{L}}} = \\sqrt{1.4} , \\qquad a_{R} = \\sqrt{\\gamma\\frac{p_{R}}{\\rho_{R}}} = \\sqrt{1.4\\cdot\\frac{0.1}{0.125}} = \\sqrt{1.12}.\n$$\nThus,\n$$\na_{L} = \\sqrt{1.4} \\approx 1.1832159566, \\qquad a_{R} = \\sqrt{1.12} \\approx 1.0583005244,\n$$\nand the interface speed of sound (arithmetic average) is\n$$\na_{f} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(a_{L} + a_{R}\\right) \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1.1832159566 + 1.0583005244\\right) \\approx 1.1207582405.\n$$\n\nThe Mach numbers at the initial states are\n$$\nM_{L} = \\frac{u_{L}}{a_{L}} = 0, \\qquad M_{R} = \\frac{u_{R}}{a_{R}} = 0.\n$$\nFor subsonic AUSM splitting,\n$$\nM^{+}(0) = \\frac{1}{4}(0 + 1)^{2} = \\frac{1}{4}, \\qquad M^{-}(0) = -\\frac{1}{4}(0 - 1)^{2} = -\\frac{1}{4}.\n$$\n\nWe now compute the total specific enthalpies. For an ideal gas,\n$$\nH = \\frac{E + p}{\\rho} = \\frac{1}{\\rho}\\left(\\frac{p}{\\gamma - 1} + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho u^{2} + p\\right) = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma - 1}\\frac{p}{\\rho} + \\frac{1}{2}u^{2}.\n$$\nWith $u_{L} = 0$ and $u_{R} = 0$,\n$$\nH_{L} = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\gamma - 1}\\frac{p_{L}}{\\rho_{L}} = \\frac{1.4}{0.4}\\cdot\\frac{1}{1} = 3.5, \\qquad H_{R} = \\frac{1.4}{0.4}\\cdot\\frac{0.1}{0.125} = 3.5\\cdot 0.8 = 2.8.\n$$\n\nThe AUSM convective mass flux is\n$$\n\\dot{m} = a_{f}\\big(M^{+}(M_{L})\\,\\rho_{L} + M^{-}(M_{R})\\,\\rho_{R}\\big) = a_{f}\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot 1 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\cdot 0.125\\right) = a_{f}\\cdot \\frac{1}{4}\\left(1 - 0.125\\right).\n$$\nHence,\n$$\n\\dot{m} = a_{f}\\cdot \\frac{1}{4}\\cdot 0.875 = a_{f}\\cdot 0.21875 \\approx 1.1207582405 \\times 0.21875 \\approx 0.2451658651.\n$$\n\nThe AUSM convective energy flux at the face is constructed as the upwinded enthalpy weighted by the split mass contributions,\n$$\n\\dot{m}H \\equiv a_{f}\\big(M^{+}(M_{L})\\,\\rho_{L}H_{L} + M^{-}(M_{R})\\,\\rho_{R}H_{R}\\big) = a_{f}\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot 1 \\cdot 3.5 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\cdot 0.125 \\cdot 2.8\\right).\n$$\nCompute the bracket:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{4}\\cdot 3.5 = 0.875, \\qquad \\frac{1}{4}\\cdot 0.125 \\cdot 2.8 = 0.0875,\n$$\nso\n$$\n\\dot{m}H = a_{f}\\left(0.875 - 0.0875\\right) = a_{f}\\cdot 0.7875 \\approx 1.1207582405 \\times 0.7875 \\approx 0.8825971144.\n$$\n\nThus, the requested $\\dot{m}H$ is approximately $0.8825971144$ in the chosen nondimensionalization.\n\nExplanation of the split across the discontinuity: The Euler energy flux can be written as $\\rho H u$, which separates naturally into a convective transport of enthalpy by mass motion. In the Advection Upstream Splitting Method (AUSM), the energy flux uses only this advective form, built from an upwinded mass flux and enthalpy, while the pressure flux is split and applied to the momentum equation via pressure-split terms. Even though the initial velocities satisfy $u_{L} = u_{R} = 0$, the subsonic polynomial Mach-number splitting generates nonzero $M^{+}$ and $M^{-}$, producing a finite advective mass flux $\\dot{m}$ proportional to the interface speed of sound and to the jump in state variables. Consequently, a nonzero advective energy flux $\\dot{m}H$ results immediately at $t = 0^{+}$ due to the enthalpy difference across the discontinuity. The pressure work term does not directly enter the energy flux in the classical AUSM formulation; instead, it is accounted for in the momentum flux through pressure splitting, ensuring correct shock capturing while maintaining an advective-only energy flux construction.",
