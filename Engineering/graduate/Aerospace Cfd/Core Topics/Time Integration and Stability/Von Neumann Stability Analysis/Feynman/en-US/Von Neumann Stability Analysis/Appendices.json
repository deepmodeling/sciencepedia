We denote the temperature at a discrete spatial node $j$ and a discrete time step $n$ as $T_j^n$, where $x_j = j\\Delta x$ and $t_n = n\\Delta t$. In the FTCS scheme, the time derivative is approximated by a forward difference, and the spatial second derivative is approximated by a central difference:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} \\bigg|_{j,n} \\approx \\frac{T_j^{n+1} - T_j^n}{\\Delta t}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial x^2} \\bigg|_{j,n} \\approx \\frac{T_{j+1}^n - 2T_j^n + T_{j-1}^n}{(\\Delta x)^2}\n$$\nSubstituting these approximations into the heat equation yields the explicit finite difference equation:\n$$\n\\frac{T_j^{n+1} - T_j^n}{\\Delta t} = \\alpha \\frac{T_{j+1}^n - 2T_j^n + T_{j-1}^n}{(\\Delta x)^2}\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to solve for the temperature at the subsequent time step, $T_j^{n+1}$:\n$$\nT_j^{n+1} = T_j^n + \\frac{\\alpha \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2} (T_{j+1}^n - 2T_j^n + T_{j-1}^n)\n$$\nIt is conventional to define the dimensionless diffusion number, $r$, as:\n$$\nr = \\frac{\\alpha \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2}\n$$\nWith this definition, the discretized equation simplifies to:\n$$\nT_j^{n+1} = T_j^n + r(T_{j+1}^n - 2T_j^n + T_{j-1}^n)\n$$\nTo determine the stability of this numerical scheme, we perform a von Neumann stability analysis. This method investigates the amplification or decay of a single Fourier mode of numerical error. Let the error at node $j$ and time step $n$ be $\\epsilon_j^n$. The error must also satisfy the same finite difference equation:\n$$\n\\epsilon_j^{n+1} = \\epsilon_j^n + r(\\epsilon_{j+1}^n - 2\\epsilon_j^n + \\epsilon_{j-1}^n)\n$$\nWe postulate a single Fourier mode for the error of the form:\n$$\n\\epsilon_j^n = E^n e^{i k_m x_j} = E^n e^{i k_m j \\Delta x}\n$$\nwhere $E^n$ is the error amplitude at time level $n$, $i = \\sqrt{-1}$, and $k_m$ is the wave number of the error component. Substituting this into the error equation gives:\n$$\nE^{n+1} e^{i k_m j \\Delta x} = E^n e^{i k_m j \\Delta x} + r(E^n e^{i k_m (j+1) \\Delta x} - 2E^n e^{i k_m j \\Delta x} + E^n e^{i k_m (j-1) \\Delta x})\n$$\nThe amplification factor, $G = \\frac{E^{n+1}}{E^n}$, which represents the factor by which the error amplitude is multiplied at each time step, is obtained by dividing the equation by $E^n e^{i k_m j \\Delta x}$:\n$$\nG = 1 + r(e^{i k_m \\Delta x} - 2 + e^{-i k_m \\Delta x})\n$$\nUsing Euler's identity, $e^{i\\theta} + e^{-i\\theta} = 2\\cos(\\theta)$, we simplify the expression in parentheses:\n$$\nG = 1 + r(2\\cos(k_m \\Delta x) - 2) = 1 - 2r(1 - \\cos(k_m \\Delta x))\n$$\nEmploying the trigonometric half-angle identity, $1 - \\cos(\\theta) = 2\\sin^2(\\frac{\\theta}{2})$, the amplification factor becomes:\n$$\nG = 1 - 4r \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k_m \\Delta x}{2}\\right)\n$$\nFor the numerical scheme to be stable, the error must not grow unboundedly. This requires the magnitude of the amplification factor to be less than or equal to one for all possible wave numbers, i.e., $|G| \\le 1$. This is equivalent to the condition $-1 \\le G \\le 1$.\n\nSince $r = \\frac{\\alpha \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2}$ is inherently positive (as $\\alpha > 0$, $\\Delta t > 0$), and $\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k_m \\Delta x}{2}\\right) \\ge 0$, the term $4r \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k_m \\Delta x}{2}\\right)$ is non-negative. This automatically satisfies the upper bound $G \\le 1$.\n\nThe limiting stability constraint arises from the lower bound, $G \\ge -1$:\n$$\n1 - 4r \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k_m \\Delta x}{2}\\right) \\ge -1\n$$\n$$\n2 \\ge 4r \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k_m \\Delta x}{2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nr \\le \\frac{1}{2 \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k_m \\Delta x}{2}\\right)}\n$$\nThis inequality must be satisfied for all wave numbers $k_m$. The most restrictive case (the \"worst case\" for stability) occurs when the right-hand side is at its minimum, which corresponds to the maximum value of the term $\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k_m \\Delta x}{2}\\right)$. The maximum value of the sine-squared function is $1$, which occurs for the highest frequency modes resolvable by the grid (e.g., when $k_m \\Delta x = \\pi$). Imposing this worst-case condition yields the stability criterion:\n$$\nr \\le \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nSubstituting the definition of $r$ back into this inequality, we find the constraint on the time step $\\Delta t$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\le \\frac{1}{2} \\implies \\Delta t \\le \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{2\\alpha}\n$$\nThe maximum stable time step, $\\Delta t_{\\max}$, is therefore:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{2\\alpha}\n$$\nWe now proceed to calculate the numerical values of the parameters.

It requires a correct derivation and interpretation of the amplification factor to understand the scheme's nuanced behavior (e.g., distinguishing stability from dispersion).\n7.  **Outside Scientific Verifiability**: The claims can be rigorously verified through mathematical derivation.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the solution derivation.\n\n### Derivation of the Amplification Factor\n\nTo perform the von Neumann stability analysis, we consider a single Fourier mode as a solution to the numerical scheme:\n$$\nu_j^n = G^n(k) e^{ikx_j} = G^n(k) e^{ikj\\Delta x}\n$$\nHere, $k$ is the wavenumber, $G(k)$ is the amplification factor for that mode, $n$ is the time level index, and $j$ is the spatial index. We substitute this ansatz into the numerical scheme.\n\nThe scheme is:\n$$\n\\frac{u_j^{n+1} - u_j^n}{\\Delta t} + \\frac{a}{4\\Delta x} \\left( u_{j+1}^{n+1} - u_{j-1}^{n+1} + u_{j+1}^n - u_{j-1}^n \\right) = 0\n$$\nSubstituting the Fourier mode for each term:\n*   $u_j^{n+1} \\rightarrow G^{n+1} e^{ikj\\Delta x} = G \\cdot G^n e^{ikj\\Delta x}$\n*   $u_j^n \\rightarrow G^n e^{ikj\\Delta x}$\n*   $u_{j\\pm 1}^{n} \\rightarrow G^n e^{ik(j\\pm 1)\\Delta x} = G^n e^{ikj\\Delta x} e^{\\pm ik\\Delta x}$\n*   $u_{j\\pm 1}^{n+1} \\rightarrow G^{n+1} e^{ik(j\\pm 1)\\Delta x} = G \\cdot G^n e^{ikj\\Delta x} e^{\\pm ik\\Delta x}$\n\nPlugging these into the scheme and dividing by the common factor $G^n e^{ikj\\Delta x}$ yields an equation for $G$:\n$$\n\\frac{G - 1}{\\Delta t} + \\frac{a}{4\\Delta x} \\left( (G e^{ik\\Delta x} - G e^{-ik\\Delta x}) + (e^{ik\\Delta x} - e^{-ik\\Delta x}) \\right) = 0\n$$\nWe can factor out $G$ from the first two terms in the parenthesis and use the identity $e^{i\\phi} - e^{-i\\phi} = 2i\\sin\\phi$. Let $\\theta = k\\Delta x$ be the dimensionless wavenumber.\n$$\n\\frac{G - 1}{\\Delta t} + \\frac{a}{4\\Delta x} \\left( G(2i\\sin\\theta) + (2i\\sin\\theta) \\right) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{G - 1}{\\Delta t} + \\frac{a}{2\\Delta x} i\\sin\\theta (G + 1) = 0\n$$\nLet $C = \\frac{a\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}$ be the Courant number. Multiplying by $\\Delta t$:\n$$\n(G - 1) + \\frac{C}{2} i\\sin\\theta (G + 1) = 0\n$$\nNow, we solve for $G$:\n$$\nG - 1 + i\\frac{C}{2}\\sin\\theta \\cdot G + i\\frac{C}{2}\\sin\\theta = 0\n$$\n$$\nG \\left(1 + i\\frac{C}{2}\\sin\\theta \\right) = 1 - i\\frac{C}{2}\\sin\\theta\n$$\n$$\nG = \\frac{1 - i\\frac{C}{2}\\sin\\theta}{1 + i\\frac{C}{2}\\sin\\theta}\n$$\n\n### Analysis of the Amplification Factor\n\n1.  **Stability (Magnitude of $G$)**:\n    The amplification factor $G$ is a complex number of the form $\\frac{1-iz}{1+iz}$, where $z = \\frac{C}{2}\\sin\\theta$ is a real number. The magnitude of such a complex number is:\n    $$\n    |G| = \\left| \\frac{1 - iz}{1 + iz} \\right| = \\frac{|1 - iz|}{|1 + iz|} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1^2 + (-z)^2}}{\\sqrt{1^2 + z^2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{1 + z^2}}{\\sqrt{1 + z^2}} = 1\n    $$\n    Since $|G| = 1$ for all values of $C$ and $\\theta$ (i.e., for all $\\Delta t$, $\\Delta x$, and $k$), the scheme is **unconditionally stable** in the von Neumann sense. The fact that the magnitude is exactly $1$ means the scheme is **neutrally stable** or **non-dissipative**; it does not damp the amplitude of any Fourier mode.\n\n2.  **Dispersion (Phase of $G$)**:\n    For the exact solution of the advection equation, $u(x,t) = f(x-at)$, a Fourier mode $e^{ikx}$ evolves to $e^{ik(x-a\\Delta t)} = e^{-iak\\Delta t}e^{ikx}$ over a time step $\\Delta t$. The exact amplification factor is $G_{exact} = e^{-iak\\Delta t}$. The exact phase shift is $\\phi_{exact} = ak\\Delta t = C\\theta$.\n\n    The numerical amplification factor can be written in polar form $G = e^{-i\\phi_{num}}$. The numerical phase shift $\\phi_{num}$ can be found from the expression for $G$. Let $z = \\tan(\\alpha) = \\frac{C}{2}\\sin\\theta$. Then $G = \\frac{1-i\\tan\\alpha}{1+i\\tan\\alpha} = \\frac{\\cos\\alpha - i\\sin\\alpha}{\\cos\\alpha + i\\sin\\alpha} = \\frac{e^{-i\\alpha}}{e^{i\\alpha}} = e^{-2i\\alpha}$.\n    So, the numerical phase shift is $\\phi_{num} = 2\\alpha = 2\\arctan(z)$.\n    $$\n    \\phi_{num} = 2\\arctan\\left(\\frac{C}{2}\\sin\\theta\\right)\n    $$\n    Dispersion occurs if the numerical phase velocity, $v_p = \\frac{\\omega_{num}}{k} = \\frac{\\phi_{num}}{k\\Delta t}$, depends on the wavenumber $k$.\n    $$\n    v_p = \\frac{2\\arctan\\left(\\frac{a\\Delta t}{2\\Delta x}\\sin(k\\Delta x)\\right)}{k\\Delta t}\n    $$\n    Since $\\phi_{num} \\neq \\phi_{exact}$ (i.e., $2\\arctan(\\frac{C}{2}\\sin\\theta) \\neq C\\theta$, except in the limit $\\theta \\to 0$), the numerical phase speed is not equal to the exact phase speed $a$. The phase error causes different Fourier components to travel at different speeds, a phenomenon known as numerical dispersion. Therefore, the scheme is **dispersive**.\n\n3.  **Consequences**:\n    A scheme that is non-dissipative ($|G|=1$) and dispersive is known to perform poorly for solutions with sharp gradients or discontinuities. The lack of numerical dissipation means that high-frequency errors are not damped. The dispersion causes these high-frequency components to separate from the main wave and propagate at incorrect speeds, creating spurious, non-physical oscillations (wiggles) in the numerical solution. This is a well-known characteristic of the Crank-Nicolson scheme for pure advection problems.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n*   **A. The amplification factor has unit magnitude for all wavenumbers and time steps, indicating neutral (unconditional) stability; the phase is dispersive, and the absence of numerical dissipation can yield spurious oscillations, especially near discontinuities.**\n    Our analysis shows $|G|=1$ for all parameters, which means the scheme is unconditionally and neutrally stable. Our analysis also shows the phase is not exact, meaning the scheme is dispersive. The combination of these two properties (non-dissipative and dispersive) is known to cause spurious oscillations. This statement accurately describes all key features of the scheme.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. The scheme is stable only if the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) condition $|a|\\,\\Delta t/\\Delta x \\le 1$ holds; otherwise $|G| > 1$ and solutions blow up.**\n    Our analysis proved $|G|=1$ unconditionally, regardless of the value of the Courant number $C = |a|\\,\\Delta t/\\Delta x$. This statement incorrectly claims conditional stability.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. The scheme is unconditionally unstable for high-frequency modes because $|G| > 1$ when $|\\sin\\theta|$ is large, so it inevitably exhibits exponential growth of grid-scale components.**\n    This statement claims unconditional instability. Our analysis proved $|G|=1$ for all modes, including high-frequency ones (where $\\theta$ is close to $\\pi$). The magnitude never exceeds $1$.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. The scheme is unconditionally stable and also Total Variation Diminishing (TVD), so it is monotone and suppresses oscillations near steep gradients due to implicit damping.**\n    The scheme is unconditionally stable, so the first part is correct. However, Godunov's theorem states that a linear numerical scheme that is TVD can have at most first-order accuracy. The Crank-Nicolson scheme is second-order accurate in both space and time, and thus it cannot be TVD. Non-TVD schemes can generate new oscillations. Furthermore, the scheme is non-dissipative ($|G|=1$), meaning it has no damping, implicit or otherwise, to suppress oscillations.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **E. The amplification factor exactly matches the continuum phase $e^{-i a k \\Delta t}$ for all wavenumbers, so the scheme is both non-dissipative and non-dispersive for advection.**\n    The numerical amplification factor is $G = e^{-2i \\arctan\\left(\\frac{C}{2}\\sin\\theta\\right)}$, while the exact factor is $G_{exact} = e^{-iC\\theta}$. These are not equal in general, so the scheme is dispersive. This statement incorrectly claims the scheme is non-dispersive.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**",
