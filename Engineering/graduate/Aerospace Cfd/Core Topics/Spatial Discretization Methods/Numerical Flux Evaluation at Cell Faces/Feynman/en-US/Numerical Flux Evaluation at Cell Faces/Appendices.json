            "solution": "The solution to the Riemann problem for the Burgers equation is constructed by analyzing the characteristic speeds and applying the appropriate conditions for shocks and rarefactions. The characteristic speed is given by the derivative of the flux function, $a(u) = f'(u) = u$. Since the second derivative is $f''(u) = 1  0$, the flux function is strictly convex. This property determines the structure of the solution.\n\nThe solution to the Riemann problem, $u(x,t)$, is a self-similar function of the variable $\\xi = x/t$. The Godunov flux is determined by the value of this solution at the cell interface, i.e., at $\\xi=0$. We denote this state as $u(0,t) = u^{*}$. The Godunov flux is then $f_{G} = f(u^{*})$.\n\nThere are two main cases for the solution structure, depending on the initial data $(u_{L}, u_{R})$.\n\n1.  If $u_{L}  u_{R}$, characteristics collide, and a discontinuous solution (a shock wave) must form. The speed of this shock, $s$, is given by the Rankine–Hugoniot jump condition:\n    $$\n    s = \\frac{f(u_{R}) - f(u_{L})}{u_{R} - u_{L}} = \\frac{\\tfrac{1}{2}u_{R}^{2} - \\tfrac{1}{2}u_{L}^{2}}{u_{R} - u_{L}} = \\frac{1}{2}(u_{L} + u_{R}).\n    $$\n    For a physically relevant, entropy-satisfying shock, the Lax entropy condition must hold: $f'(u_L)  s  f'(u_R)$. For the Burgers equation, this simplifies to $u_L  s  u_R$. The solution is then $u(x,t) = u_{L}$ for $x/t  s$ and $u(x,t) = u_{R}$ for $x/t  s$. The state at the interface $x=0$, $u(0,t)$, is $u_{L}$ if $s0$ (shock moves right) and $u_{R}$ if $s0$ (shock moves left).\n\n2.  If $u_{L}  u_{R}$, the characteristics diverge, creating a continuous solution known as a rarefaction fan. This solution is admissible for a convex flux. The solution is given by:\n    $$\n    u(x,t) =\n    \\begin{cases}\n    u_{L},  \\text{if } x/t \\le u_{L} \\\\\n    x/t,  \\text{if } u_{L}  x/t  u_{R} \\\\\n    u_{R},  \\text{if } x/t \\ge u_{R}\n    \\end{cases}\n    $$\n    The state at the interface, $u(0,t)$, depends on the position of the interval $[u_{L}, u_{R}]$ relative to $0$. If $u_{L}  0$, then $u(0,t) = u_{L}$. If $u_{R}  0$, then $u(0,t) = u_{R}$. If $u_{L} \\le 0 \\le u_{R}$, then $u(0,t) = 0$.\n\nWe now apply this framework to each of the four cases.\n\n**Case A: $(u_{L}, u_{R}) = (3, 1)$**\nHere, $u_{L} = 3$ and $u_{R} = 1$. Since $u_{L}  u_{R}$, the solution is a shock wave.\nThe shock speed is $s = \\frac{1}{2}(3 + 1) = 2$.\nTo verify the entropy condition, we check if $u_{L}  s  u_{R}$: $3  2  1$. The condition is satisfied.\nThe shock moves to the right ($s=2  0$). For any $t0$, the interface at $x=0$ is to the left of the shock's position $x=st$.

Since $u_{L}  u_{R}$, the solution is a shock wave.\nThe shock speed is $s = \\frac{1}{2}(-1 + (-3)) = -2$.\nTo verify the entropy condition, we check if $u_{L}  s  u_{R}$: $-1  -2  -3$.

Since $u_{L}  u_{R}$, the solution is a rarefaction wave. This is an admissible solution because the flux is convex.\nThe characteristic speeds bounding the fan are $u_{L} = -2$ and $u_{R} = 1$.\nThe solution is given by $u(x,t) = x/t$ for $-2  x/t  1$.\nThe interface at $x=0$ corresponds to $x/t = 0$, which lies within the fan since $-2  0  1$.\nThus, the state at the interface is $u(0,t) = 0$.\nThe Godunov flux is $f_{G}^{\\text{(C)}} = f(0) = \\frac{1}{2}(0)^{2} = 0$.\n\n**Case D: $(u_{L}, u_{R}) = (\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{3}{2})$**\nHere, $u_{L} = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $u_{R} = \\frac{3}{2}$. Since $u_{L}  u_{R}$, the solution is a rarefaction wave. This is an admissible solution because the flux is convex.\nThe characteristic speeds bounding the fan are $u_{L} = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $u_{R} = \\frac{3}{2}$.\nThe interface at $x=0$ corresponds to $x/t = 0$. This value is less than the slowest characteristic speed in the fan, since $0  u_{L} = \\frac{1}{2}$. This means the entire rarefaction fan moves to the right and is always downstream of the interface for $t  0$. Therefore, the state at the interface is the left state.\n$u(0,t) = u_{L} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe Godunov flux is $f_{G}^{\\text{(D)}} = f(\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\frac{1}{2})^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{8}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the total flux $F_{\\text{total}}$ by summing the individual Godunov fluxes.\n$$\nF_{\\text{total}} = f_{G}^{\\text{(A)}} + f_{G}^{\\text{(B)}} + f_{G}^{\\text{(C)}} + f_{G}^{\\text{(D)}}\n$$\n$$\nF_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{9}{2} + \\frac{9}{2} + 0 + \\frac{1}{8}\n$$\n$$\nF_{\\text{total}} = 9 + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{72}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{73}{8}.\n$$\nThe value is required as an exact rational number.",

Therefore, the minmod function returns the value with the smallest magnitude, prefixed by the common sign.\n$$\ns_{i} = \\operatorname{minmod}(-6.0, -3.5, -8.0) = \\operatorname{sign}(-3.5) \\min(|-6.0|, |-3.5|, |-8.0|) = - \\min(6.0, 3.5, 8.0) = -3.5\n$$\nNext, we compute the limited slope $s_{i+1}$ in cell $i+1$. This requires the one-sided differences, $\\delta^{-}_{i+1}$ and $\\delta^{+}_{i+1}$.\n$$\n\\delta^{-}_{i+1} = \\frac{U_{i+1} - U_{i}}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{0.4 - 1.2}{0.2} = \\frac{-0.8}{0.2} = -4.0\n$$\n$$\n\\delta^{+}_{i+1} = \\frac{U_{i+2} - U_{i+1}}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{0.6 - 0.4}{0.2} = \\frac{0.2}{0.2} = 1.0\n$$\nThe arguments for the MC limiter for $s_{i+1}$ are:\n$$\n2\\,\\delta^{-}_{i+1} = 2 \\times (-4.0) = -8.0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta^{-}_{i+1} + \\delta^{+}_{i+1}}{2} = \\frac{-4.0 + 1.0}{2} = \\frac{-3.0}{2} = -1.5\n$$\n$$\n2\\,\\delta^{+}_{i+1} = 2 \\times (1.0) = 2.0\n$$\nThe arguments ($-8.0$, $-1.5$, $2.0$) do not all have the same sign. According to the definition of the minmod function, the result is zero.\n$$\ns_{i+1} = \\operatorname{minmod}(-8.0, -1.5, 2.0) = 0\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Reconstruction of the face states $U_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}^{-}$ and $U_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}^{+}$**\n\nUsing the limited slopes, we reconstruct the states on the left and right sides of the cell face $x_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}$.\nThe left state, $U_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}^{-}$, is determined by the reconstruction in cell $i$:\n$$\nU_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}^{-} = U_{i} + \\frac{\\Delta x}{2} s_{i} = 1.2 + \\frac{0.2}{2} (-3.5) = 1.2 + 0.1 \\times (-3.5) = 1.2 - 0.35 = 0.85\n$$\nThe right state, $U_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}^{+}$, is determined by the reconstruction in cell $i+1$:\n$$\nU_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}^{+} = U_{i+1} - \\frac{\\Delta x}{2} s_{i+1} = 0.4 - \\frac{0.2}{2} (0) = 0.4 - 0 = 0.4\n$$\nSo, the left and right states for the Riemann problem at the interface are $U_L = 0.85$ and $U_R = 0.4$.\n\n**Step 3: Evaluation of the Rusanov numerical flux $\\hat{F}_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}$**\n\nThe Rusanov flux is given by the formula:\n$$\n\\hat{F}(U_{L}, U_{R}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ f(U_{L}) + f(U_{R}) \\right] - \\frac{1}{2} a \\left( U_{R} - U_{L} \\right)\n$$\nwhere $a = \\max(|f'(U_{L})|, |f'(U_{R})|)$. For the flux function $f(u) = \\frac{1}{2}u^{2}$, the derivative is $f'(u) = u$.\n\nFirst, we evaluate the flux function at the left and right states:\n$$\nf(U_L) = f(0.85) = \\frac{1}{2} (0.85)^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} (0.7225) = 0.36125\n$$\n$$\nf(U_R) = f(0.4) = \\frac{1}{2} (0.4)^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} (0.16) = 0.08\n$$\nNext, we calculate the local wave speed $a$:\n$$\na = \\max(|f'(U_L)|, |f'(U_R)|) = \\max(|U_L|, |U_R|) = \\max(|0.85|, |0.4|) = 0.85\n$$\nNow we substitute these values into the Rusanov flux formula:\n$$\n\\hat{F}_{i+\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 0.36125 + 0.08 \\right) - \\frac{1}{2} (0.85) \\left( 0.4 - 0.85 \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{F}_{i+\\frac{1}{2}} = \\frac{1}{2} (0.44125) - \\frac{1}{2} (0.85) (-0.45)\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{F}_{i+\\frac{1}{2}} = 0.220625 - (-0.19125)\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{F}_{i+\\frac{1}{2}} = 0.220625 + 0.19125 = 0.411875\n$$\nThe problem requests the final answer rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$\n\\hat{F}_{i+\\frac{1}{2}} \\approx 0.4119\n$$",
