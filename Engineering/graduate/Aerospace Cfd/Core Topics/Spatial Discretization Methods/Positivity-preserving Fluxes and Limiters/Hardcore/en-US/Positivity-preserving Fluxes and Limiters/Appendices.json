The relations provided for pressure and total energy are standard definitions. The concept of positivity-preserving schemes is a cornerstone of modern numerical methods for solving hyperbolic conservation laws, such as the Euler equations. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly stated and provides all necessary information to derive a unique solution. The constraint $p>0$ is unambiguous. The task of finding a minimum value based on this constraint is well-defined.\n- **Objective**: The problem is articulated using precise, objective scientific language. All terms ($\\rho$, $E$, $p$, $\\gamma$, $e$, $|u|$) are standard in the field.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains no discernible flaws. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to find the minimum total energy per unit volume, $E_{\\min}$, required to ensure the thermodynamic pressure $p$ is strictly positive.\n\nThe problem provides two fundamental relationships:\n1. $p = (\\gamma - 1)\\rho e$\n2. $E = \\rho e + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho |u|^2$\n\nThe condition to be satisfied is $p > 0$. From the first relation, we analyze the terms on the right-hand side. The ratio of specific heats $\\gamma$ for a physically realistic gas is strictly greater than $1$, so $(\\gamma - 1) > 0$. The mass density $\\rho$ must be non-negative, and for a physical medium, it is strictly positive, $\\rho > 0$. Therefore, the condition $p > 0$ is mathematically equivalent to the condition that the specific internal energy $e$ must be strictly positive:\n$$ e > 0 $$\n\nNow, we use the second relation, which defines the total energy per unit volume $E$. We can express the specific internal energy $e$ in terms of $E$, $\\rho$, and $|u|$. First, rearrange the equation to solve for the term $\\rho e$:\n$$ \\rho e = E - \\frac{1}{2}\\rho |u|^2 $$\nThen, divide by $\\rho$ (since $\\rho > 0$) to find $e$:\n$$ e = \\frac{E}{\\rho} - \\frac{1}{2}|u|^2 $$\nApplying the positivity constraint $e > 0$:\n$$ \\frac{E}{\\rho} - \\frac{1}{2}|u|^2 > 0 $$\nTo satisfy this inequality, the total energy per unit volume $E$ must be greater than the kinetic energy per unit volume:\n$$ E > \\frac{1}{2}\\rho |u|^2 $$\nThe minimal total energy per unit volume, $E_{\\min}$, is the infimum of the set of all possible values for $E$ that satisfy this condition. This corresponds to the boundary case where the specific internal energy approaches zero, $e \\to 0^+$, and consequently the pressure approaches zero, $p \\to 0^+$. Thus, the minimal total energy is:\n$$ E_{\\min} = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho |u|^2 $$\nThis result signifies that for pressure to be positive, the total energy must at least account for the kinetic energy content of the flow. Any value of $E$ below this threshold would imply a negative specific internal energy, which is physically impossible and would result in negative pressure.\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nThe problem requires the calculation of $E_{\\min}$ for the given parameters:\n- $\\rho = 0.2\\,\\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$\n- $|u| = 30\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n- $\\gamma = 1.4$ (Note that $E_{\\min}$ is independent of $\\gamma$)\n\nSubstituting the values for $\\rho$ and $|u|$ into the derived expression for $E_{\\min}$:\n$$ E_{\\min} = \\frac{1}{2} (0.2) (30)^2 $$\n$$ E_{\\min} = \\frac{1}{2} (0.2) (900) $$\n$$ E_{\\min} = (0.1) (900) $$\n$$ E_{\\min} = 90 $$\nThe units are derived from the calculation: $(\\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}) \\times (\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1})^2 = \\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}\\,\\text{s}^{-2} = (\\text{kg}\\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-2})\\,\\text{m}^{-2} = \\text{N}\\,\\text{m}^{-2} = \\text{Pa}$. Since $1\\,\\text{Pa} = 1\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$, the final units are Joules per cubic meter, as required.\n\n### Sensitivity Analysis\nFinally, we analyze the sensitivity of $E_{\\min}$ to the flow speed magnitude $|u|$ while keeping the density $\\rho$ fixed. The relationship is $E_{\\min} = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho|u|^2$.\n\nThe local sensitivity is the rate of change of $E_{\\min}$ with respect to $|u|$, which is given by the partial derivative:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial E_{\\min}}{\\partial |u|} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial |u|} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\rho|u|^2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho (2|u|) = \\rho|u| $$\nThis linear relationship indicates that the absolute change in $E_{\\min}$ for a unit change in $|u|$ grows proportionally with both $\\rho$ and $|u|$.\n\nThe fractional or logarithmic sensitivity measures the percentage change in $E_{\\min}$ for a percentage change in $|u|$. It is defined as $\\frac{\\partial \\ln(E_{\\min})}{\\partial \\ln(|u|)}$. We can find this by taking the natural logarithm of the expression for $E_{\\min}$:\n$$ \\ln(E_{\\min}) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\rho|u|^2\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\rho\\right) + \\ln(|u|^2) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\rho\\right) + 2\\ln(|u|) $$\nNow, taking the derivative with respect to $\\ln(|u|)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\ln(E_{\\min})}{\\partial \\ln(|u|)} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\ln(|u|)} \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\rho\\right) + 2\\ln(|u|) \\right] = 2 $$\nA constant logarithmic sensitivity of $2$ demonstrates that $E_{\\min}$ has a quadratic dependence on $|u|$. This means that a $1\\%$ increase in $|u|$ will result in a $2\\%$ increase in $E_{\\min}$, regardless of the specific values of $\\rho$ or $|u|$. This high sensitivity underscores the critical importance of accurately resolving flow speed in numerical schemes, as small errors in $|u|$ can lead to much larger relative errors in the energy threshold required for positivity.",

The maximal allowable time step, $\\Delta t_{max}$, for an SSP-RK method with coefficient $C$ is therefore given by the equality:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{max} = C \\cdot \\Delta t_{FE}\n$$\n\nWe will now apply this relation to the two methods described in the problem.\n\n**Method 1: SSPRK$(2,2)$**\nThis method is specified to have an SSP coefficient of $C_1 = 1$. The maximal allowable time step, $\\Delta t_{max,1}$, for this method to be positivity-preserving is:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{max,1} = C_1 \\cdot \\Delta t_{FE} = 1 \\cdot (2.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{s})\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta t_{max,1} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{s}\n$$\n\n**Method 2: Hypothetical SSP Method**\nThis method is specified to have an SSP coefficient of $C_2 = 2$. The maximal allowable time step, $\\Delta t_{max,2}$, for this method to be positivity-preserving is:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{max,2} = C_2 \\cdot \\Delta t_{FE} = 2 \\cdot (2.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{s})\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta t_{max,2} = 4.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{s}\n$$\nThese are the maximal time steps for each respective method that guarantee the cell-averaged density and pressure remain positive throughout the integration from time level $n$ to $n+1$.",
