This practice guides you through a classic problem in fluid dynamics—Couette flow—to derive the temperature distribution and wall heat flux directly from the energy equation.

            "problem": "A planar laminar Couette flow of a Newtonian gas between two infinite parallel plates is analyzed within the framework of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The lower plate at $y=0$ is maintained at an isothermal condition with temperature $T_{1}$, while the upper plate at $y=H$ moves in the $x$-direction with constant speed $U$ and is held at an isothermal condition with temperature $T_{2}$. The gas has constant dynamic viscosity $\\mu$ and constant thermal conductivity $k$. The flow is steady and two-dimensional, and pressure work, axial conduction, body forces, and volumetric heat sources are negligible. The temperature field is assumed to depend only on the wall-normal coordinate $y$, and the velocity field has only an $x$-component that depends on $y$.\n\nStarting from the First Law of Thermodynamics for a continuum and the energy equation for a compressible Newtonian fluid with constant properties, and using the constitutive relation for viscous stresses and Fourier’s law of heat conduction, derive the wall-normal temperature distribution in the gap and obtain the wall heat flux at the lower isothermal wall. You must explicitly show how viscous dissipation enters the energy balance and how the wall heat flux follows from the temperature gradient via Fourier’s law. Clearly state the boundary conditions corresponding to isothermal and adiabatic walls, and identify which one applies at each plate in this scenario.\n\nUse the following data: $H = 1.000 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $U = 2.000 \\times 10^{2}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$, $\\mu = 1.800 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{kg/(m\\cdot s)}$, $k = 2.600 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{W/(m\\cdot K)}$, $T_{1} = 3.000 \\times 10^{2}\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $T_{2} = 2.800 \\times 10^{2}\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nCompute the lower-wall heat flux $q''_{w}$ (defined positive when directed from the wall into the fluid) using Fourier’s law, and express your final answer in $\\mathrm{W/m^{2}}$. Round your answer to four significant figures. The final answer must be a single real number.",
            "solution": "The problem is first validated and found to be scientifically sound, well-posed, and based on established principles of fluid mechanics and heat transfer. All necessary data are provided, and the assumptions are consistent and physically reasonable for the described scenario.\n\nThe analysis begins with the steady-state energy equation for a fluid with constant properties, considering viscous dissipation but neglecting pressure work, body forces, and volumetric heat sources. Under the problem's assumptions—two-dimensional flow with velocity $\\vec{v} = (u(y), 0, 0)$ and temperature $T = T(y)$—the energy equation simplifies significantly. The general form of the energy equation in terms of temperature for a fluid with constant thermal conductivity $k$ is:\n$$ \\rho c_p \\frac{DT}{Dt} = \\nabla \\cdot (k \\nabla T) + \\Phi + \\beta T \\frac{Dp}{Dt} $$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the density, $c_p$ is the specific heat at constant pressure, $\\frac{D}{Dt}$ is the material derivative, $\\Phi$ is the viscous dissipation function, and the last term relates to pressure changes, which is specified as negligible. For steady flow ($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 0$), the material derivative is $\\frac{D}{Dt} = \\vec{v} \\cdot \\nabla = u(y) \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$. Since $T = T(y)$, the advection term $\\rho c_p u(y) \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x}$ is zero. With constant $k$ and $T=T(y)$, the conduction term becomes $k \\frac{d^2 T}{dy^2}$. Therefore, the energy equation reduces to a balance between conduction in the wall-normal direction and viscous heating:\n$$ k \\frac{d^2 T}{dy^2} + \\Phi = 0 $$\n\nThe viscous dissipation function $\\Phi$ represents the rate at which mechanical energy is converted into internal energy per unit volume due to viscous stresses. For a Newtonian fluid, it is given by $\\Phi = \\tau_{ij} \\frac{\\partial v_i}{\\partial x_j}$. Given the velocity field $\\vec{v} = (u(y), 0, 0)$, the only non-zero velocity gradient is $\\frac{du}{dy}$. The only non-zero component of the viscous stress tensor is $\\tau_{xy} = \\tau_{yx} = \\mu \\frac{du}{dy}$. Consequently, the dissipation function simplifies to:\n$$ \\Phi = \\mu \\left( \\frac{du}{dy} \\right)^2 $$\n\nTo evaluate $\\Phi$, the velocity profile $u(y)$ must be determined. For a steady, fully developed planar Couette flow with no pressure gradient ($\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} = 0$), the $x$-momentum equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 u}{dy^2} = 0 $$\nIntegrating twice yields the general solution $u(y) = C_1 y + C_2$. The constants are determined from the no-slip boundary conditions:\n1. At the lower plate ($y=0$): $u(0) = 0$. This gives $C_2 = 0$.\n2. At the upper plate ($y=H$): $u(H) = U$. This gives $C_1 H = U$, so $C_1 = \\frac{U}{H}$.\nThe velocity profile is linear:\n$$ u(y) = \\frac{U}{H} y $$\nThe velocity gradient is constant throughout the fluid: $\\frac{du}{dy} = \\frac{U}{H}$.\n\nSubstituting this constant gradient into the expression for $\\Phi$ and then into the energy equation, we obtain a second-order ordinary differential equation for the temperature profile $T(y)$:\n$$ k \\frac{d^2 T}{dy^2} + \\mu \\left( \\frac{U}{H} \\right)^2 = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{d^2 T}{dy^2} = -\\frac{\\mu}{k} \\left( \\frac{U}{H} \\right)^2 $$\nIntegrating once with respect to $y$ gives the temperature gradient:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dy} = -\\frac{\\mu}{k} \\left( \\frac{U}{H} \\right)^2 y + A $$\nIntegrating a second time yields the general solution for the temperature distribution:\n$$ T(y) = -\\frac{\\mu}{2k} \\left( \\frac{U}{H} \\right)^2 y^2 + A y + B $$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are integration constants determined by the thermal boundary conditions at the walls.\n\nThe problem specifies boundary conditions at the walls. It is instructive to first define the two common types of thermal boundary conditions in CFD:\n- **Isothermal Wall**: The temperature is fixed to a specified value, $T_{wall}$. For a wall at $y=y_w$, the condition is $T(y_w) = T_{wall}$.\n- **Adiabatic Wall**: There is no heat transfer across the wall. According to Fourier's law of heat conduction, this implies that the temperature gradient normal to the wall is zero. For a wall at $y=y_w$, the condition is $\\frac{dT}{dy}\\Big|_{y=y_w} = 0$.\n\nIn this problem, both walls are isothermal:\n1. At the lower plate ($y=0$): $T(0) = T_1$.\n2. At the upper plate ($y=H$): $T(H) = T_2$.\n\nApplying the first boundary condition to the general solution for $T(y)$:\n$$ T(0) = T_1 \\implies -\\frac{\\mu}{2k} \\left( \\frac{U}{H} \\right)^2 (0)^2 + A(0) + B = T_1 \\implies B = T_1 $$\nApplying the second boundary condition:\n$$ T(H) = T_2 \\implies -\\frac{\\mu}{2k} \\left( \\frac{U}{H} \\right)^2 H^2 + A H + T_1 = T_2 $$\n$$ -\\frac{\\mu U^2}{2k} + A H = T_2 - T_1 $$\nSolving for $A$:\n$$ A = \\frac{T_2 - T_1}{H} + \\frac{\\mu U^2}{2kH} $$\nThe complete temperature distribution is therefore:\n$$ T(y) = T_1 + \\left( \\frac{T_2 - T_1}{H} + \\frac{\\mu U^2}{2kH} \\right) y - \\frac{\\mu U^2}{2kH^2} y^2 $$\n\nThe problem requires the heat flux at the lower wall, $q''_{w}$. Heat flux is given by Fourier's law, $\\vec{q} = -k \\nabla T$. In this one-dimensional case, the heat flux in the $y$-direction is $q''_y(y) = -k \\frac{dT}{dy}$. The problem defines $q''_{w}$ as positive when directed from the wall into the fluid, which corresponds to the $+y$ direction at $y=0$. Thus, $q''_{w} = q''_y(0) = -k \\frac{dT}{dy}\\Big|_{y=0}$.\nThe temperature gradient is:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dy} = -\\frac{\\mu U^2}{k H^2} y + A = -\\frac{\\mu U^2}{k H^2} y + \\frac{T_2 - T_1}{H} + \\frac{\\mu U^2}{2kH} $$\nEvaluating at $y=0$:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dy}\\Big|_{y=0} = \\frac{T_2 - T_1}{H} + \\frac{\\mu U^2}{2kH} $$\nThe wall heat flux $q''_{w}$ is then:\n$$ q''_{w} = -k \\left( \\frac{T_2 - T_1}{H} + \\frac{\\mu U^2}{2kH} \\right) = -k \\frac{T_2 - T_1}{H} - k \\frac{\\mu U^2}{2kH} $$\n$$ q''_{w} = k \\frac{T_1 - T_2}{H} - \\frac{\\mu U^2}{2H} $$\nThis expression clearly shows the two contributions to the wall heat flux: the first term is an ordinary conduction flux due to the temperature difference between the plates, and the second term is a flux directed towards the wall, originating from the viscous dissipation within the fluid.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$H = 1.000 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$U = 2.000 \\times 10^{2}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$\n$\\mu = 1.800 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{kg/(m\\cdot s)}$\n$k = 2.600 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{W/(m\\cdot K)}$\n$T_{1} = 3.000 \\times 10^{2}\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n$T_{2} = 2.800 \\times 10^{2}\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n\nCalculating the two terms separately:\nThe conduction term:\n$$ k \\frac{T_1 - T_2}{H} = (2.600 \\times 10^{-2}) \\frac{(3.000 \\times 10^{2}) - (2.800 \\times 10^{2})}{1.000 \\times 10^{-3}} = (2.600 \\times 10^{-2}) \\frac{20.00}{1.000 \\times 10^{-3}} = 520.0\\,\\mathrm{W/m^2} $$\nThe viscous dissipation term:\n$$ \\frac{\\mu U^2}{2H} = \\frac{(1.800 \\times 10^{-5}) (2.000 \\times 10^{2})^2}{2 (1.000 \\times 10^{-3})} = \\frac{(1.800 \\times 10^{-5}) (4.000 \\times 10^{4})}{2.000 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{0.7200}{2.000 \\times 10^{-3}} = 360.0\\,\\mathrm{W/m^2} $$\nThe net heat flux at the lower wall is:\n$$ q''_{w} = 520.0\\,\\mathrm{W/m^2} - 360.0\\,\\mathrm{W/m^2} = 160.0\\,\\mathrm{W/m^2} $$\nThe result, $160.0$, has four significant figures as requested.",

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It represents a canonical problem in high-speed aerodynamics. We will now proceed with a formal derivation and solution.\n\nThe starting point is the steady, two-dimensional, compressible boundary-layer energy equation for a flat plate at zero pressure gradient, neglecting body forces. In terms of static enthalpy $h$, for a fluid with constant properties, the equation is:\n$$ \\rho \\left( u \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y} \\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left( k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} \\right) + \\mu \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\right)^2 $$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the density, $u$ and $v$ are the velocity components in the $x$ and $y$ directions respectively, $k$ is the thermal conductivity, $T$ is the static temperature, and $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity. The term on the left represents enthalpy convection, while the terms on the right represent heat conduction and viscous dissipation, respectively.\n\nFor a calorically perfect gas, the enthalpy is related to temperature by $dh = c_p dT$, where $c_p$ is the specific heat at constant pressure. This allows us to write the conduction term as $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left( \\frac{k}{c_p} \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y} \\right)$. Introducing the Prandtl number, $\\Pr = \\frac{\\mu c_p}{k}$, a constant, the energy equation becomes:\n$$ \\rho \\left( u \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y} \\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left( \\frac{\\mu}{\\Pr} \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y} \\right) + \\mu \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\right)^2 $$\nThe problem requires using the total (or stagnation) enthalpy, defined as $h_0 = h + \\frac{u^2}{2}$. We express the material derivative of $h_0$ and substitute the energy equation and the boundary-layer momentum equation:\n$$ \\rho \\frac{D h_0}{Dt} = \\rho \\left( u \\frac{\\partial h_0}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial h_0}{\\partial y} \\right) = \\rho \\frac{Dh}{Dt} + \\rho \\frac{D}{Dt}\\left(\\frac{u^2}{2}\\right) $$\nThe momentum equation for a zero pressure gradient boundary layer is $\\rho \\frac{Du}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial \\tau_{yx}}{\\partial y}$, where $\\tau_{yx} = \\mu \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}$. Thus, $\\rho \\frac{D}{Dt}(\\frac{u^2}{2}) = \\rho u \\frac{Du}{Dt} = u \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(\\mu \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y})$.\nSubstituting this and the static enthalpy equation into the expression for $\\rho \\frac{D h_0}{Dt}$:\n$$ \\rho \\frac{D h_0}{Dt} = \\left[ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left( \\frac{\\mu}{\\Pr} \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y} \\right) + \\mu \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\right)^2 \\right] + u \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\mu \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right) $$\nUsing the product rule, $u \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(\\mu \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}(u \\mu \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}) - (\\mu \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y})\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}$. The dissipation term can be written as $(\\mu \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y})\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}$. Combining these, we get:\n$$ \\rho \\frac{D h_0}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left( \\frac{\\mu}{\\Pr} \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y} + u \\mu \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\right) $$\nTo write this equation entirely in terms of $h_0$, we use $h = h_0 - \\frac{u^2}{2}$, so $\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial h_0}{\\partial y} - u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}$. Substitution yields the total enthalpy energy equation:\n$$ \\rho \\left( u \\frac{\\partial h_0}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial h_0}{\\partial y} \\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left[ \\frac{\\mu}{\\Pr} \\frac{\\partial h_0}{\\partial y} + \\mu \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{\\Pr} \\right) u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\right] $$\nThis form of the energy equation is particularly insightful.\n\nFirst, we specialize this balance to an adiabatic wall. An adiabatic wall is a surface with zero heat transfer, so $q_w = 0$. By Fourier's law, $q_w = -k (\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y})_{y=0}$. For a non-zero thermal conductivity $k$, this implies $(\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y})_{y=0} = 0$. For a calorically perfect gas, this is equivalent to $(\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y})_{y=0} = 0$. At the wall ($y=0$), the no-slip condition requires $u=0$. From the relation $\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial h_0}{\\partial y} - u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}$, we see that at the wall, $(\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial y})_{w} = (\\frac{\\partial h_0}{\\partial y})_{w}$. Thus, the adiabatic wall condition is equivalent to $(\\frac{\\partial h_0}{\\partial y})_{w} = 0$.\n\nThe adiabatic wall temperature, $T_{w,\\mathrm{ad}}$, represents the temperature the wall reaches in the absence of heat transfer. Due to viscous heating within the boundary layer, $T_{w,\\mathrm{ad}}$ is higher than the free-stream static temperature $T_{\\infty}$ but, for $\\Pr  1$, lower than the free-stream total temperature $T_{0,\\infty}$. We introduce a dimensionless recovery factor, $r$, to characterize this temperature rise:\n$$ r = \\frac{T_{w,\\mathrm{ad}} - T_{\\infty}}{T_{0,\\infty} - T_{\\infty}} $$\nFor a calorically perfect gas, this can also be written in terms of enthalpy: $r = \\frac{h_{w,\\mathrm{ad}} - h_{\\infty}}{h_{0,\\infty} - h_{\\infty}}$.\n\nNext, we determine the recovery factor as a function of the Prandtl number, $\\Pr$. For the special case $\\Pr = 1$, the total enthalpy energy equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\rho \\left( u \\frac{\\partial h_0}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial h_0}{\\partial y} \\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left( \\mu \\frac{\\partial h_0}{\\partial y} \\right) $$\nThis equation is mathematically identical in form to the momentum equation for $u$. With corresponding boundary conditions ($u=0$ at the wall, $u \\to u_{\\infty}$ in the free stream; $h_0 = h_{w}$ at the wall, $h_0 \\to h_{0,\\infty}$ in the free stream), similarity solutions show that the normalized profiles are identical: $\\frac{u}{u_{\\infty}} = \\frac{h_0 - h_w}{h_{0,\\infty} - h_w}$. Applying the adiabatic wall condition $(\\frac{\\partial h_0}{\\partial y})_w=0$ to this solution implies $h_w = h_{0,\\infty}$. Thus for $\\Pr=1$, $T_{w,\\mathrm{ad}} = T_{0,\\infty}$, and the recovery factor is $r=1$. For a general $\\Pr$, a rigorous analysis based on similarity transformations (extending the Blasius solution to the energy equation) for a laminar boundary layer on a flat plate yields the classical result:\n$$ r = \\Pr^{1/2} $$\nThis result is a cornerstone of high-speed boundary layer theory.\n\nWe then relate the free-stream total temperature $T_{0,\\infty}$ to the static temperature $T_{\\infty}$ and Mach number $M_{\\infty}$. The definition of total temperature for a calorically perfect gas is $T_0 = T + \\frac{u^2}{2 c_p}$. Using the relations for a calorically perfect gas, $c_p = \\frac{\\gamma R}{\\gamma-1}$ and the speed of sound $a = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T}$, we can express the kinetic energy term as:\n$$ \\frac{u^2}{2 c_p} = \\frac{(M a)^2}{2 c_p} = \\frac{M^2 (\\gamma R T)}{2 \\left(\\frac{\\gamma R}{\\gamma-1}\\right)} = T \\left( \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M^2 \\right) $$\nTherefore, the relationship is:\n$$ T_0 = T \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M^2 \\right) $$\nApplying this to the free-stream conditions gives:\n$$ T_{0,\\infty} = T_{\\infty} \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_{\\infty}^2 \\right) $$\n\nFinally, we combine these results to find the expression for the adiabatic wall temperature $T_{w,\\mathrm{ad}}$. From the definition of the recovery factor:\n$$ T_{w,\\mathrm{ad}} = T_{\\infty} + r (T_{0,\\infty} - T_{\\infty}) $$\nSubstituting the expression for $T_{0,\\infty}$:\n$$ T_{w,\\mathrm{ad}} = T_{\\infty} + r \\left[ T_{\\infty} \\left( 1 + \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_{\\infty}^2 \\right) - T_{\\infty} \\right] = T_{\\infty} + r T_{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_{\\infty}^2 \\right) $$\nFactoring $T_{\\infty}$ and substituting $r=\\Pr^{1/2}$:\n$$ T_{w,\\mathrm{ad}} = T_{\\infty} \\left( 1 + \\Pr^{1/2} \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_{\\infty}^2 \\right) $$\nThis is the required closed-form expression.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression for the given parameters: $T_{\\infty} = 220\\ \\mathrm{K}$, $M_{\\infty} = 6.0$, $\\gamma = 1.4$, and $\\Pr = 0.72$.\nFirst, we calculate the term in the parenthesis:\n$$ 1 + \\Pr^{1/2} \\frac{\\gamma-1}{2} M_{\\infty}^2 = 1 + (0.72)^{1/2} \\frac{1.4-1}{2} (6.0)^2 $$\n$$ = 1 + \\sqrt{0.72} \\times \\frac{0.4}{2} \\times 36.0 $$\n$$ = 1 + (0.8485281...) \\times 0.2 \\times 36.0 $$\n$$ = 1 + (0.8485281...) \\times 7.2 $$\n$$ = 1 + 6.1094025... $$\n$$ = 7.1094025... $$\nNow, we multiply by $T_{\\infty}$:\n$$ T_{w,\\mathrm{ad}} = 220 \\times 7.1094025... $$\n$$ T_{w,\\mathrm{ad}} = 1564.0685... \\ \\mathrm{K} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $1564\\ \\mathrm{K}$.",

            "solution": "The problem has been validated and is determined to be scientifically sound, well-posed, and self-contained. All necessary physical laws, geometric definitions, and numerical constraints are provided and are mutually consistent. The problem represents a standard, fundamental task in the development of numerical solvers for computational fluid dynamics and heat transfer.\n\nThe primary objective is to derive a second-order accurate numerical approximation for the wall-normal heat flux, $q_n$, at a solid boundary located at $y=0$. The fluid domain is in the region $y0$. The physical law governing heat conduction is Fourier's Law, $\\mathbf{q} = -k \\nabla T$, where $\\mathbf{q}$ is the heat flux vector, $k$ is the thermal conductivity, and $T$ is the temperature. The wall-normal heat flux $q_n$ is the projection of this vector onto the outward unit normal of the fluid domain, $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}} = +\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$.\n$$q_n = \\mathbf{q} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{n}} = (-k \\nabla T) \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{y}} = -k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}$$\nThe evaluation is to be performed at the wall, $y=0$. The sign convention is therefore established: a positive $q_n$ corresponds to heat flux in the $+\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ direction, meaning heat is transferred from the wall into the fluid. A negative $q_n$ signifies heat transfer out of the fluid and into the wall.\n\nThe numerical scheme is based on the Finite Volume Method (FVM) using a uniform Cartesian mesh. The first fluid cell center is at $y_1 = \\Delta y/2$, where its temperature is denoted $T_1$. To achieve second-order accuracy for the derivative at the boundary $y=0$, we employ a single ghost cell centered at $y_g = -\\Delta y/2$, with temperature $T_g$. A second-order accurate central difference approximation for the temperature gradient at the wall ($y=0$), which is the midpoint between the first cell center and the ghost cell center, is given by:\n$$\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}\\bigg|_{y=0} \\approx \\frac{T_1 - T_g}{y_1 - y_g} = \\frac{T_1 - T_g}{(\\Delta y/2) - (-\\Delta y/2)} = \\frac{T_1 - T_g}{\\Delta y}$$\nThe value of the ghost cell temperature $T_g$ is not a degree of freedom; it is determined by enforcing the physical boundary condition at the wall. We now derive $T_g$ for the two specified boundary conditions.\n\n**1. Isothermal Wall Boundary Condition**\nFor an isothermal wall, the temperature is prescribed as a constant value $T_w$ at $y=0$.\n$$T(y=0) = T_w$$\nTo maintain second-order accuracy, we assume that the temperature at the wall, which lies at the geometric center between the first interior cell center and the ghost cell center, can be approximated by a linear interpolation of the temperatures at these cell centers.\n$$T_w \\approx \\frac{T_1 + T_g}{2}$$\nFrom this relation, we solve for the required ghost cell temperature $T_g$:\n$$T_g = 2T_w - T_1$$\nSubstituting this expression for $T_g$ into the central difference formula for the gradient gives:\n$$\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}\\bigg|_{y=0} \\approx \\frac{T_1 - (2T_w - T_1)}{\\Delta y} = \\frac{2T_1 - 2T_w}{\\Delta y} = \\frac{2(T_1 - T_w)}{\\Delta y}$$\nFinally, the wall-normal heat flux $q_n$ for the isothermal case is:\n$$q_n = -k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}\\bigg|_{y=0} \\approx -k \\frac{2(T_1 - T_w)}{\\Delta y}$$\nIf the fluid near the wall is hotter than the wall ($T_1  T_w$), this formula yields a negative $q_n$, correctly representing heat flux out of the fluid domain. Conversely, if the wall is hotter ($T_w  T_1$), $q_n$ is positive, representing heat flux into the fluid.\n\n**2. Adiabatic Wall Boundary Condition**\nFor an adiabatic (thermally insulating) wall, the normal temperature gradient at the wall is zero.\n$$\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}\\bigg|_{y=0} = 0$$\nThis directly implies that the wall-normal heat flux is zero.\n$$q_n = -k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}\\bigg|_{y=0} = -k(0) = 0$$\nTo implement this in the numerical scheme, we enforce the zero-gradient condition on our central difference approximation:\n$$\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y}\\bigg|_{y=0} \\approx \\frac{T_1 - T_g}{\\Delta y} = 0$$\nThis gives the condition for the ghost cell temperature:\n$$T_g = T_1$$\nThis is a zero-gradient (or symmetric) condition. Substituting this back into the flux calculation confirms the result:\n$$q_n \\approx -k \\left(\\frac{T_1 - T_1}{\\Delta y}\\right) = 0$$\nFor the adiabatic case, the heat flux is exactly zero, independent of $T_1$, $k$, or $\\Delta y$. The prescribed wall temperature $T_w$ in the test case is irrelevant for this calculation, as it is not a boundary condition that is enforced but rather a value that would result from the simulation.\n\n**Summary of Formulas for Implementation:**\n- **Isothermal:** $q_n = -k \\frac{2(T_1 - T_w)}{\\Delta y}$\n- **Adiabatic:** $q_n = 0.0$\n\nThese formulas will be used to compute the results for the given test suite.",
