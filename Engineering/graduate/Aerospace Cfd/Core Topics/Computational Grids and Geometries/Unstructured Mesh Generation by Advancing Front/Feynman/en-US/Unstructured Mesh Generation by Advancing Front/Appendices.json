For anisotropic meshes, which are crucial for efficiently resolving directional phenomena in aerodynamics, this process is guided by a local metric tensor. This practice demonstrates how to construct a new triangular element based on a given front edge and an anisotropic metric, evaluating its quality in the transformed space where ideal elements become equilateral. This exercise provides hands-on experience with the fundamental mechanics of anisotropic mesh generation, connecting the abstract concept of a metric tensor to concrete quality checks that determine element acceptability .",

            "problem": "Consider a two-dimensional planar, polygonal boundary in an Aerospace Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) pre-processing context. At a local straight segment on the boundary, the advancing front consists of two adjacent boundary edges that meet at a corner: the edge from point $A$ to point $B$ is $A=(0,0)$, $B=(1,0)$, and the adjacent boundary rays from $A$ and $B$ both point into the physical domain along the positive vertical direction, that is, from $A$ along the ray $\\overrightarrow{AD}$ with direction vector $(0,1)$ and from $B$ along the ray $\\overrightarrow{BC}$ with direction vector $(0,1)$. The physical domain is thus the upper half-plane relative to the segment $\\overline{AB}$.\n\nThe advancing front method seeks to generate a new triangle off the active front edge $\\overline{AB}$ that conforms to the boundary and respects a uniform local target spacing. Let the target spacing be $s=0.6\\,\\text{m}$. A naive placement strategy for the apex point chooses the candidate apex $N_{\\text{naive}}$ at a distance $s$ along the outward normal from the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$, but mistakenly uses the outward normal pointing into the exterior (below the boundary), placing\n$$\nM_{AB}=\\left(\\frac{0+1}{2},\\frac{0+0}{2}\\right)=(0.5,0),\\quad N_{\\text{naive}}=(0.5,-0.6).\n$$\nThis creates a triangle $\\triangle ABN_{\\text{naive}}$ that overlaps the exterior of the domain and does not preserve the visibility constraints of the advancing front.\n\nStarting only from the fundamental geometric definitions used in advancing front methods (visibility cone defined by the adjacent boundary rays and equal-distance selection from the front endpoints for the new apex), derive the visibility-constrained corrective rule that restores a valid apex placement $P$ without sacrificing boundary conformity. Specifically, impose the following two conditions for the corrected apex $P=(x,y)$:\n- Equal-distance condition to the front endpoints: $|P-A|=|P-B|=s$.\n- Visibility-cone condition induced by the adjacent boundary rays: $P$ must lie in the intersection of the half-planes corresponding to points visible from both $A$ and $B$ along the interior rays, which in this configuration is the half-plane $y\\ge 0$.\n\nCompute the corrected apex coordinate $P$ explicitly. Express your final coordinate in meters, and round each component to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of computational geometry and mesh generation techniques used in computational fluid dynamics. The problem is well-posed, providing a self-contained and consistent set of conditions that lead to a unique and meaningful solution. All terms are defined objectively, and the required data is present.\n\nThe task is to determine the coordinates of a new apex point $P=(x,y)$ for a triangle to be generated from the active front edge $\\overline{AB}$. The endpoints of this edge are given as $A=(0,0)$ and $B=(1,0)$. The target edge length, or spacing, for the new triangle is specified as $s=0.6\\,\\text{m}$. The placement of point $P$ is governed by two strict conditions.\n\nThe first condition is the equal-distance requirement: the new point $P$ must be at a distance $s$ from both endpoints of the front edge, $A$ and $B$. This can be expressed as a system of two equations:\n$$|P-A| = s$$\n$$|P-B| = s$$\nUsing the distance formula in a Cartesian coordinate system, where $P=(x,y)$, $A=(0,0)$, and $B=(1,0)$, we can write these equations in squared form:\n$$(x-0)^2 + (y-0)^2 = s^2 \\implies x^2 + y^2 = s^2$$\n$$(x-1)^2 + (y-0)^2 = s^2 \\implies (x-1)^2 + y^2 = s^2$$\nBy equating the two left-hand side expressions, we find the locus of points equidistant from $A$ and $B$:\n$$x^2 + y^2 = (x-1)^2 + y^2$$\n$$x^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1$$\n$$0 = -2x + 1$$\nThis yields $x = \\frac{1}{2}$. Geometrically, this confirms that the apex $P$ must lie on the perpendicular bisector of the segment $\\overline{AB}$, which is the line $x=\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nNow, we substitute this value of $x$ back into the first distance equation, $x^2 + y^2 = s^2$, along with the given target spacing $s=0.6$.\n$$\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + y^2 = (0.6)^2$$\n$$(0.5)^2 + y^2 = (0.6)^2$$\n$$0.25 + y^2 = 0.36$$\n$$y^2 = 0.36 - 0.25$$\n$$y^2 = 0.11$$\nSolving for $y$, we find two possible solutions:\n$$y = \\pm\\sqrt{0.11}$$\nThis gives two potential locations for the apex point $P$: one at $(0.5, \\sqrt{0.11})$ and the other at $(0.5, -\\sqrt{0.11})$.\n\nThe second condition is the visibility-cone constraint. The problem states that the physical domain is the upper half-plane relative to the boundary segment $\\overline{AB}$. The adjacent boundary rays, which define the limits of visibility from the endpoints $A$ and $B$, both point into the physical domain along the positive vertical direction. This implies that any valid new point must lie within the physical domain. The condition is explicitly stated as requiring the apex $P=(x,y)$ to lie in the half-plane $y \\ge 0$.\n\nWe must now apply this constraint to select the correct solution for $y$. Of the two possible values, $y = \\sqrt{0.11}$ and $y = -\\sqrt{0.11}$, only the positive root satisfies the condition $y \\ge 0$.\nTherefore, the correct $y$-coordinate for the apex is:\n$$y = \\sqrt{0.11}$$\nThe incorrect apex $N_{\\text{naive}}=(0.5,-0.6)$ mentioned in the problem description correctly identifies the perpendicular bisector but places the point outside the physical domain, thus violating the visibility constraint. The corrective rule, by enforcing both distance and visibility, restores a valid placement.\n\nThe coordinates of the corrected apex point $P$ are thus $(0.5, \\sqrt{0.11})$.\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed in meters, with each component rounded to four significant figures.\nThe $x$-coordinate is exactly $0.5$. To four significant figures, this is written as $0.5000$.\nThe $y$-coordinate is calculated as:\n$$y = \\sqrt{0.11} \\approx 0.331662479...$$\nRounding this value to four significant figures gives $0.3317$.\nThe coordinates of the corrected apex $P$ are therefore $(0.5000, 0.3317)\\,\\text{m}$.",

Let $S$ be the shape operator, a linear endomorphism on the tangent space at each point of the surface. The shape operator is defined by $S(\\mathbf{t}) = -D_{\\mathbf{t}}\\mathbf{n}$, where $D_{\\mathbf{t}}\\mathbf{n}$ is the tangential component of the gradient of $\\mathbf{n}$ in the direction of the tangent vector $\\mathbf{t}$.

The scalar triple product can be evaluated by noting that the cross product of the first two vectors is aligned with the normal $\\mathbf{n}$.

Therefore:\n$$\nJ(u,v,w) = J_0(u,v) \\det(I - wS)\n$$\nThe determinant of the operator $(I - wS)$ is the product of its eigenvalues. The eigenvalues of $S$ are the principal curvatures $\\kappa_1$ and $\\kappa_2$. The eigenvalues of $(I - wS)$ are therefore $(1 - w\\kappa_1)$ and $(1 - w\\kappa_2)$. Thus:\n$$\n\\det(I - wS) = (1 - w\\kappa_1(u,v))(1 - w\\kappa_2(u,v))\n$$\nThe full expression for the Jacobian determinant is:\n$$\nJ(u,v,w) = J_0(u,v) (1 - w\\kappa_1(u,v))(1 - w\\kappa_2(u,v))\n$$\nFor the element to be valid, we require $J(u,v,w) > 0$ for all $(u,v)$ in the triangle and for all $w \\in [0, h]$. Since $J_0 > 0$, this requires:\n$$\n(1 - w\\kappa_1(u,v))(1 - w\\kappa_2(u,v)) > 0\n$$\nAt the wall surface, $w=0$, the expression evaluates to $1$. For the expression to remain positive for $w \\in (0, h]$, it must not pass through zero. This means each factor must remain positive:\n$$\n1 - w\\kappa_1(u,v) > 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 1 - w\\kappa_2(u,v) > 0\n$$\nIf a principal curvature $\\kappa_i$ is non-positive ($\\kappa_i \\le 0$), the term $(1 - w\\kappa_i)$ is greater than or equal to $1$ for $w > 0$, which poses no issue. The constraint arises from positive principal curvatures. For any $\\kappa_i(u,v) > 0$, we must satisfy $w\\kappa_i(u,v) < 1$, or $w < 1/\\kappa_i(u,v)$.\n\nThis condition must hold for all $w \\in [0, h]$, for both principal curvatures, and at every point $(u,v)$ on the wall triangle. The most restrictive condition is imposed by the largest positive principal curvature found anywhere on the triangle. We require:\n$$\nh < \\frac{1}{\\kappa} \\quad \\text{for every positive principal curvature } \\kappa \\text{ on the patch.}\n$$\nThis is equivalent to the condition:\n$$\nh < \\frac{1}{\\max_{(u,v), i \\in \\{1,2\\}} \\{\\kappa_i(u,v)\\}}\n$$\nwhere the maximum is taken over all points on the triangle and both principal curvatures. We are given the bounds $\\kappa_1(u,v) \\le \\kappa_{1,\\max}$ and $\\kappa_2(u,v) \\le \\kappa_{2,\\max}$. The maximum possible curvature value on the patch is therefore bounded by $\\max(\\kappa_{1,\\max}, \\kappa_{2,\\max})$. To guarantee the condition is met, we must base our constraint on this upper bound:\n$$\nh < \\frac{1}{\\max(\\kappa_{1,\\max}, \\kappa_{2,\\max})}\n$$\nThis is the derived condition on $h$ that guarantees a strictly positive Jacobian.\n\nFor the second part of the problem, we are given the numerical values:\n$$\n\\kappa_{1,\\max} = 120\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\kappa_{2,\\max} = 80\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\n$$\nWe find the maximum of these two bounds:\n$$\n\\max(\\kappa_{1,\\max}, \\kappa_{2,\\max}) = \\max(120\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}, 80\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}) = 120\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\n$$\nThe condition on $h$ is therefore $h < 1 / (120\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1})$.
