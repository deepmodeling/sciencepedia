Stability Analysis of the Advection Step**\n\nThe advection equation is discretized using a forward Euler scheme in time and a first-order upwind scheme in space. For a positive wave speed $a  0$, the upwind scheme uses the spatial derivative approximation at grid point $j$ and time level $n$, $(\\frac{\\partial q'}{\\partial x})_j^n \\approx \\frac{q'_j{}^n - q'_{j-1}{}^n}{\\Delta x}$. The semi-discrete equation for the advection step is:\n$$\n\\frac{q'^{*}_j - q'_j{}^n}{\\Delta t} + a \\left( \\frac{q'_j{}^n - q'_{j-1}{}^n}{\\Delta x} \\right) = 0\n$$\nwhere $q'^{*}$ is the intermediate solution after the advection step. Rearranging for $q'^{*}_j$ gives the update rule:\n$$\nq'^{*}_j = q'_j{}^n - \\frac{a \\Delta t}{\\Delta x} (q'_j{}^n - q'_{j-1}{}^n)\n$$\nLet $C = \\frac{a \\Delta t}{\\Delta x}$ be the Courant number. The equation becomes:\n$$\nq'^{*}_j = q'_j{}^n - C (q'_j{}^n - q'_{j-1}{}^n)\n$$\nTo perform a von Neumann stability analysis, we consider a single Fourier mode of the form $q'_j{}^n = \\hat{q}^n(k) \\exp(i k x_j)$, where $k$ is the wavenumber and $x_j = j \\Delta x$. The amplification factor, $G_{adv}(k) = \\frac{\\hat{q}^{n+1}(k)}{\\hat{q}^n(k)}$, is found by substituting this form into the update rule:\n$$\nG_{adv} \\exp(i k j \\Delta x) = \\exp(i k j \\Delta x) - C (\\exp(i k j \\Delta x) - \\exp(i k (j-1) \\Delta x))\n$$\nDividing by $\\exp(i k j \\Delta x)$ yields:\n$$\nG_{adv} = 1 - C (1 - \\exp(-i k \\Delta x))\n$$\nFor stability, the magnitude of the amplification factor must be less than or equal to one for all wavenumbers, i.e., $|G_{adv}| \\le 1$.

Since $C = \\frac{a \\Delta t}{\\Delta x}  0$ and $(1 - \\cos(\\theta)) \\ge 0$, this requires that the term $-2C(1-C)(1 - \\cos(\\theta))$ be non-positive. This condition is satisfied if $C(1-C) \\ge 0$. As $C0$, we must have $1-C \\ge 0$, which implies $C \\le 1$.\nThis is the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) condition for this scheme.

This inequality is $|1 - \\sigma_j \\Delta t| \\le 1$, which is equivalent to:\n$$\n-1 \\le 1 - \\sigma_j \\Delta t \\le 1\n$$\nThe right-hand inequality, $1 - \\sigma_j \\Delta t \\le 1$, implies $-\\sigma_j \\Delta t \\le 0$. Since $\\sigma_j \\ge 0$ and $\\Delta t  0$, this is always satisfied.\nThe left-hand inequality, $-1 \\le 1 - \\sigma_j \\Delta t$, implies $\\sigma_j \\Delta t \\le 2$.\nThis constraint must hold for all sponge strengths $\\sigma_j$ in the domain. The most restrictive case corresponds to the maximum sponge strength, $\\sigma_{\\max}$. Thus, the stability constraint from the sponge layer is:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\le \\frac{2}{\\sigma_{\\max}}\n$$\nLet's call this upper bound $\\Delta t_{\\text{sponge}}$.\n\n**3. Combined Stability Constraint and Final Calculation**\n\nFor the overall operator-split scheme to be stable, the time step $\\Delta t$ must satisfy both constraints simultaneously.

Rearranging the terms to group $A$ and $B$:\n$$\n\\alpha A \\;=\\; \\alpha B + 2i\\omega B\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha A \\;=\\; (\\alpha + 2i\\omega) B\n$$\nSolving for the ratio $B/A$:\n$$\nr(\\alpha, \\omega) = \\frac{B}{A} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha + 2i\\omega}\n$$\n\n**2. Derivation of the Transfer Function $T(\\alpha, \\omega)$**\n\nFor this part, there is no incident wave from the interior, so $A=0$. The external pressure drive has a complex amplitude $P_{e}$, so $\\hat{p}_{\\mathrm{ext}} = P_{e}$. The general relation becomes:\n$$\n-2i\\omega B \\;=\\; -\\alpha(0 - B) + \\frac{\\alpha P_{e}}{\\rho_{0} a_{0}}\n$$\n$$\n-2i\\omega B \\;=\\; \\alpha B + \\frac{\\alpha P_{e}}{\\rho_{0} a_{0}}\n$$\nWe seek the transfer function $T(\\alpha, \\omega) = \\hat{p}/P_{e}$. First, we need to find $\\hat{p}$ in terms of $P_{e}$. With $A=0$, the pressure amplitude at the boundary is $\\hat{p} = \\rho_{0} a_{0}(0-B) = -\\rho_{0} a_{0} B$. This implies $B = -\\hat{p}/(\\rho_{0} a_{0})$. Substituting this expression for $B$ into the equation:\n$$\n-2i\\omega \\left(-\\frac{\\hat{p}}{\\rho_{0} a_{0}}\\right) \\;=\\; \\alpha \\left(-\\frac{\\hat{p}}{\\rho_{0} a_{0}}\\right) + \\frac{\\alpha P_{e}}{\\rho_{0} a_{0}}\n$$\nMultiplying the entire equation by $\\rho_{0} a_{0}$ simplifies it to:\n$$\n2i\\omega \\hat{p} \\;=\\; -\\alpha \\hat{p} + \\alpha P_{e}\n$$\nRearranging to solve for $\\hat{p}$:\n$$\n2i\\omega \\hat{p} + \\alpha \\hat{p} \\;=\\; \\alpha P_{e}\n$$\n$$\n(\\alpha + 2i\\omega) \\hat{p} \\;=\\; \\alpha P_{e}\n$$\nThe transfer function is therefore:\n$$\nT(\\alpha, \\omega) = \\frac{\\hat{p}}{P_{e}} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha + 2i\\omega}\n$$\nWe note that the reflection coefficient and the transfer function are identical: $r(\\alpha, \\omega) = T(\\alpha, \\omega)$.\n\n**3. Optimization for the Relaxation Rate $\\alpha^{\\star}$**\n\nThe problem is to choose the relaxation rate $\\alpha  0$ to minimize the magnitude of the reflection coefficient, $|r(\\alpha, \\omega)|$, subject to the constraint that the magnitude of the transfer function is at least $\\eta$, i.e., $|T(\\alpha, \\omega)| \\ge \\eta$, where $\\eta \\in (0,1)$.\n\nSince we found that $r(\\alpha, \\omega) = T(\\alpha, \\omega)$, the problem is equivalent to:\nMinimize $|T(\\alpha, \\omega)|$ subject to $|T(\\alpha, \\omega)| \\ge \\eta$.\n\nFirst, let's compute the magnitude of $T(\\alpha, \\omega)$:\n$$\n|T(\\alpha, \\omega)| = \\left|\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha + 2i\\omega}\\right| = \\frac{|\\alpha|}{|\\alpha + 2i\\omega|}\n$$\nSince $\\alpha  0$:\n$$\n|T(\\alpha, \\omega)| = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\sqrt{\\alpha^2 + (2\\omega)^2}} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\sqrt{\\alpha^2 + 4\\omega^2}}\n$$\nLet us define the function to be minimized as $f(\\alpha) = |T(\\alpha, \\omega)|$. We need to understand its behavior as a function of $\\alpha$. To do this, we compute its derivative with respect to $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\frac{df}{d\\alpha} = \\frac{d}{d\\alpha} \\left( \\frac{\\alpha}{(\\alpha^2 + 4\\omega^2)^{1/2}} \\right)\n$$\nUsing the quotient rule for differentiation:\n$$\n\\frac{df}{d\\alpha} = \\frac{1 \\cdot (\\alpha^2 + 4\\omega^2)^{1/2} - \\alpha \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{2}(\\alpha^2 + 4\\omega^2)^{-1/2}(2\\alpha)\\right)}{\\alpha^2 + 4\\omega^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{df}{d\\alpha} = \\frac{(\\alpha^2 + 4\\omega^2)^{1/2} - \\alpha^2(\\alpha^2 + 4\\omega^2)^{-1/2}}{\\alpha^2 + 4\\omega^2}\n$$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $(\\alpha^2 + 4\\omega^2)^{1/2}$ gives:\n$$\n\\frac{df}{d\\alpha} = \\frac{(\\alpha^2 + 4\\omega^2) - \\alpha^2}{(\\alpha^2 + 4\\omega^2)^{3/2}} = \\frac{4\\omega^2}{(\\alpha^2 + 4\\omega^2)^{3/2}}\n$$\nSince $\\omega  0$ and $\\alpha  0$, the numerator $4\\omega^2$ is positive and the denominator $(\\alpha^2 + 4\\omega^2)^{3/2}$ is also positive. Therefore, $\\frac{df}{d\\alpha}  0$ for all $\\alpha  0$. This means that $f(\\alpha) = |T(\\alpha, \\omega)|$ is a strictly monotonically increasing function of $\\alpha$.\n\nThe optimization problem is to minimize a monotonically increasing function $f(\\alpha)$ subject to the constraint $f(\\alpha) \\ge \\eta$. The smallest value that $f(\\alpha)$ can take while satisfying the constraint is exactly $\\eta$. Therefore, the optimal solution is found by setting the function equal to the constraint's lower bound:\n$$\n|T(\\alpha^\\star, \\omega)| = \\eta\n$$\nWe now solve for the optimal rate $\\alpha^\\star$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\alpha^\\star}{\\sqrt{(\\alpha^\\star)^2 + 4\\omega^2}} = \\eta\n$$\nSquaring both sides of the equation:\n$$\n\\frac{(\\alpha^\\star)^2}{(\\alpha^\\star)^2 + 4\\omega^2} = \\eta^2\n$$\nNow, we solve for $(\\alpha^\\star)^2$:\n$$\n(\\alpha^\\star)^2 = \\eta^2 ((\\alpha^\\star)^2 + 4\\omega^2)\n$$\n$$\n(\\alpha^\\star)^2 = \\eta^2 (\\alpha^\\star)^2 + 4\\eta^2\\omega^2\n$$\n$$\n(\\alpha^\\star)^2 - \\eta^2 (\\alpha^\\star)^2 = 4\\eta^2\\omega^2\n$$\n$$\n(\\alpha^\\star)^2 (1 - \\eta^2) = 4\\eta^2\\omega^2\n$$\n$$\n(\\alpha^\\star)^2 = \\frac{4\\eta^2\\omega^2}{1 - \\eta^2}\n$$\nSince $\\alpha$ must be positive, we take the positive square root to find $\\alpha^\\star$:\n$$\n\\alpha^\\star = \\sqrt{\\frac{4\\eta^2\\omega^2}{1 - \\eta^2}} = \\frac{2\\eta\\omega}{\\sqrt{1 - \\eta^2}}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the optimal relaxation rate. Since $\\eta \\in (0,1)$, the term $1 - \\eta^2$ is positive, and the expression is well-defined and real. The units of $\\alpha^\\star$ are the same as $\\omega$, which is $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, consistent with the physical meaning of a relaxation rate parameter.",
