It is a standard problem in the field of uncertainty quantification using Polynomial Chaos Expansions (PCE) for a simple system modeled by the Finite Element Method (FEM). All necessary data and definitions for computing the requested coefficient are provided. The values are physically consistent, as the Young's modulus $E(\\xi) = E_{0}(1 + \\beta \\xi)$ remains positive for $\\beta = 1/5$ over the domain $\\xi \\in [-1,1]$. The problem is therefore valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe first step is to an find an analytical expression for the quantity of interest, $Q(\\xi)$. The system is a one-dimensional, linear elastic bar of length $L$, cross-sectional area $A$, and Young's modulus $E(\\xi)$. It is fixed at $x=0$ and subjected to a tensile traction $T$ at $x=L$. As the problem is modeled by a single linear element and the material property $E(\\xi)$ is spatially uniform for any given realization of $\\xi$, the axial stress $\\sigma$ and strain $\\epsilon$ are constant throughout the bar.\nThe stress is given by $\\sigma = T/A$.\nThe strain is related to displacement $u(x)$ by $\\epsilon = du/dx$.\nHooke's law states $\\sigma = E(\\xi)\\epsilon$.\nCombining these, we have $T/A = E(\\xi)du/dx$.\nThe strain is constant, so we can write $du/dx = C$. The displacement field is then $u(x, \\xi) = C x + D$.\nThe boundary condition at the fixed end is $u(0, \\xi)=0$, which implies $D=0$.\nThus, $u(x, \\xi) = C x$. The strain is $du/dx = C$.\nFrom Hooke's law, $C = \\frac{T}{A E(\\xi)}$.\nThe displacement field is $u(x, \\xi) = \\frac{T x}{A E(\\xi)}$.\nThe tip displacement at $x=L$ is $u(L, \\xi) = \\frac{T L}{A E(\\xi)}$.\n\nThe problem defines the normalized quantity of interest, $Q(\\xi)$, as the ratio of the tip displacement to its nominal deterministic value. The nominal value corresponds to the mean of the random input, which is $\\xi=0$, so $E = E_0$. The nominal tip displacement is $u_{nom} = \\frac{T L}{A E_0}$.\nThe quantity of interest is therefore:\n$$Q(\\xi) = \\frac{u(L, \\xi)}{u_{nom}} = \\frac{T L / (A E(\\xi))}{T L / (A E_0)} = \\frac{E_0}{E(\\xi)}$$\nSubstituting the given expression for $E(\\xi)=E_{0}(1+\\beta\\xi)$ with $\\beta=1/5$:\n$$Q(\\xi) = \\frac{E_0}{E_0(1+\\beta\\xi)} = \\frac{1}{1+\\beta\\xi} = \\frac{1}{1+\\frac{1}{5}\\xi}$$\n\nThe Polynomial Chaos Expansion of $Q(\\xi)$ is given by $Q(\\xi) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} c_n \\psi_n(\\xi)$, where $\\{\\psi_n(\\xi)\\}$ is an orthonormal basis. The coefficients $c_n$ are computed via projection:\n$$c_n = \\langle Q(\\xi), \\psi_n(\\xi) \\rangle$$\nThe random variable $\\xi$ is uniformly distributed on $[-1,1]$, so its probability density function is $p(\\xi) = 1/2$.

We then compute the product of the corresponding normalized weights, $W_{ij} = \\tilde{w}_i^{(U)}\\,\\tilde{w}_j^{(N)}$. The mean and second moment are approximated by accumulating the sums:\n    *   $\\mathbb{E}[C_L] \\approx \\sum_{i,j} W_{ij} \\, C_L(\\alpha_i, M_j)$\n    *   $\\mathbb{E}[C_L^2] \\approx \\sum_{i,j} W_{ij} \\, (C_L(\\alpha_i, M_j))^2$\n\n5.  **Calculate Variance**: The variance is computed from the moments using the formula $\\mathrm{Var}[C_L] \\approx \\mathbb{E}[C_L^2] - (\\mathbb{E}[C_L])^2$.\n\nThe program will execute this process for each of the four test cases and format the final output as specified.",
