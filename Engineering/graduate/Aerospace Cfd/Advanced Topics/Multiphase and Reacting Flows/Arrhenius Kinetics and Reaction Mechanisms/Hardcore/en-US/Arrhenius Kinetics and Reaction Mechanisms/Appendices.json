            "problem": "In supersonic combustor simulations within Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), elementary reactions are modeled by the law of mass action. Consider an elementary consumption step with overall molecularity $n$, written generically as a sum of $n$ reactant molecules transforming into products. Let $c_i$ denote the molar concentration of species $i$ in $\\text{mol}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$, and let the scalar reaction progress rate $r$ for the elementary step be defined as the rate of consumption of an arbitrary reactant, with $r$ required to have units $\\text{mol}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It is grounded in the fundamental principles of chemical kinetics and dimensional analysis, providing all necessary definitions and constraints to determine a unique, meaningful solution. The problem is therefore deemed valid and will be solved as stated.\n\nThe task is to determine the physical units of the forward rate constant, $k$, for an elementary reaction of overall molecularity $n$. The final result must be expressed as a set of exponents for the base units of meters ($\\text{m}$), moles ($\\text{mol}$), and seconds ($\\text{s}$). The analysis will proceed in three parts as requested: justifying the units of the reaction rate $r$, performing a dimensional analysis to find the units of $k$ for a general $n$, and verifying the result for specific cases.\n\nFirst, we justify the units of the reaction progress rate, $r$. The problem defines $c_i$ as the molar concentration of species $i$, with units of $\\text{mol}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$. Molar concentration is defined as the amount of substance (in moles) per unit volume. The reaction rate for a species is fundamentally defined as the change in its concentration over time. As stated in the problem, we consider $r$ to be the rate of consumption of a reactant. Let us denote the concentration of an arbitrary reactant as $c$. Its rate of change with respect to time $t$ is the derivative $\\frac{dc}{dt}$. The rate of consumption is therefore $-\\frac{dc}{dt}$. The units of this quantity are derived from the units of concentration and time. Let $[X]$ denote the units of a physical quantity $X$.\nThe units of concentration are given as $[c] = \\text{mol}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$.\nThe unit of time is the second, $[t] = \\text{s}$.\nThe units of the reaction rate $r$ are therefore:\n$$\n[r] = \\left[\\frac{dc}{dt}\\right] = \\frac{[c]}{[t]} = \\frac{\\text{mol}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}}{\\text{s}} = \\text{mol}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThis confirms from first principles that the required units of $r$ are $\\text{mol}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, consistent with the problem statement.\n\nSecond, we perform a dimensional analysis on the given mass-action rate law to find the units of the rate constant $k$. The rate law for an elementary step is given as:\n$$\nr = k \\prod_{i \\in \\mathcal{R}} c_i^{\\nu_i}\n$$\nHere, $\\mathcal{R}$ is the set of reactant species, and $\\nu_i$ are the respective stoichiometric orders, which are positive integers. The overall molecularity of the reaction is $n = \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{R}} \\nu_i$.\n\nFor this equation to be dimensionally consistent, the units on the left-hand side must equal the units on the right-hand side.\n$$\n[r] = [k] \\left[\\prod_{i \\in \\mathcal{R}} c_i^{\\nu_i}\\right]\n$$\nThe units of the product term can be determined by raising the units of concentration to the power of each order $\\nu_i$ and multiplying.\n$$\n\\left[\\prod_{i \\in \\mathcal{R}} c_i^{\\nu_i}\\right] = \\prod_{i \\in \\mathcal{R}} [c_i]^{\\nu_i} = \\prod_{i \\in \\mathcal{R}} (\\text{mol}\\,\\text{m}^{-3})^{\\nu_i}\n$$\nUsing the property of exponents $(a^b)^c = a^{bc}$ and $a^b a^c = a^{b+c}$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\left[\\prod_{i \\in \\mathcal{R}} c_i^{\\nu_i}\\right] = (\\text{mol}\\,\\text{m}^{-3})^{\\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{R}} \\nu_i}\n$$\nSince the overall molecularity is $n = \\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{R}} \\nu_i$, the units of the product of concentrations are:\n$$\n\\left[\\prod_{i \\in \\mathcal{R}} c_i^{\\nu_i}\\right] = (\\text{mol}\\,\\text{m}^{-3})^{n} = \\text{mol}^{n}\\,\\text{m}^{-3n}\n$$\nNow, we can solve for the units of $k$:\n$$\n[k] = \\frac{[r]}{\\left[\\prod_{i \\in \\mathcal{R}} c_i^{\\nu_i}\\right]}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived units for $[r]$ and the concentration product term:\n$$\n[k] = \\frac{\\text{mol}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}}{\\text{mol}^{n}\\,\\text{m}^{-3n}}\n$$\nTo simplify this expression, we combine the exponents for each base unit (m, mol, s):\n$$\n[k] = (\\text{m}^{-3}) \\cdot (\\text{m}^{-(-3n)}) \\cdot (\\text{mol}^{1}) \\cdot (\\text{mol}^{-n}) \\cdot (\\text{s}^{-1})\n$$\n$$\n[k] = \\text{m}^{-3 + 3n} \\cdot \\text{mol}^{1 - n} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n[k] = \\text{m}^{3(n-1)} \\cdot \\text{mol}^{1-n} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the answer in the form of an ordered triple of exponents $(\\alpha(n), \\beta(n), \\gamma)$ corresponding to the units $\\text{m}^{\\alpha(n)}\\,\\text{mol}^{\\beta(n)}\\,\\text{s}^{\\gamma}$. By inspection of our derived unit for $k$, we identify these exponents:\n$\\alpha(n) = 3(n-1)$\n$\\beta(n) = 1-n$\n$\\gamma = -1$\n\nThird, we verify this general result for unimolecular ($n=1$), bimolecular ($n=2$), and termolecular ($n=3$) reactions.\n\nCase 1: Unimolecular reaction ($n=1$)\nThe rate law is of the form $r = k c_A$.\nUsing our general formula for the units of $k$:\n$[k] = \\text{m}^{3(1-1)} \\cdot \\text{mol}^{1-1} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1} = \\text{m}^{0} \\cdot \\text{mol}^{0} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1} = \\text{s}^{-1}$.\nThis is the well-known unit for a first-order rate constant. The exponents are $(\\alpha(1), \\beta(1), \\gamma) = (0, 0, -1)$.\n\nCase 2: Bimolecular reaction ($n=2$)\nThe rate law is of the form $r = k c_A c_B$ or $r = k c_A^2$.\nUsing our general formula:\n$[k] = \\text{m}^{3(2-1)} \\cdot \\text{mol}^{1-2} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1} = \\text{m}^{3} \\cdot \\text{mol}^{-1} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}$.\nThis is the standard unit for a second-order rate constant when concentration is in $\\text{mol}\\,\\text{m}^{-3}$. The exponents are $(\\alpha(2), \\beta(2), \\gamma) = (3, -1, -1)$.\n\nCase 3: Termolecular reaction ($n=3$)\nThe rate law is of the form $r = k c_A c_B c_C$ (or other combinations of order $3$).\nUsing our general formula:\n$[k] = \\text{m}^{3(3-1)} \\cdot \\text{mol}^{1-3} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1} = \\text{m}^{6} \\cdot \\text{mol}^{-2} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}$.\nThis is the correct unit for a third-order rate constant with the given concentration units. The exponents are $(\\alpha(3), \\beta(3), \\gamma) = (6, -2, -1)$.\n\nThe verifications confirm the correctness of our general derivation. The requested triple of exponents for the units of $k$ as a function of the overall molecularity $n$ is $(3(n-1), 1-n, -1)$.",

The reaction rates for pathway $i$ ($i \\in \\{1,2\\}$) are given by the law of mass action. Since the pathways are described as unimolecular and share the same reactant $X$ with identical stoichiometric order, we can write their rates as $r_1 = k_1 [X]^m$ and $r_2 = k_2 [X]^m$, where $[X]$ is the molar concentration of species $X$ and $m$ is the common reaction order (here, $m=1$ for unimolecular reactions under pseudo-first-order conditions). The condition that the rates are equal, $r_1 = r_2$, at the crossover temperature $T^{\\ast}$ implies:\n$$k_1(T^{\\ast}) [X]^{m} = k_2(T^{\\ast}) [X]^{m}$$\nGiven that the concentration $[X]$ is non-zero, we can divide both sides by $[X]^{m}$, which leads to the condition that the rate constants themselves must be equal:\n$$k_1(T^{\\ast}) = k_2(T^{\\ast})$$\nThe rate constants are given by the modified Arrhenius law with a common temperature exponent $n$:\n$$k_{i}(T) = A_{i}\\,T^{n}\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{ai}}{R\\,T}\\right)$$\nSubstituting this form into the equality at $T=T^{\\ast}$:\n$$A_{1}\\,(T^{\\ast})^{n}\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{a1}}{R\\,T^{\\ast}}\\right) = A_{2}\\,(T^{\\ast})^{n}\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{a2}}{R\\,T^{\\ast}}\\right)$$\nSince $T^{\\ast}$ must be a positive temperature for any physically meaningful combustion process, the term $(T^{\\ast})^{n}$ is non-zero and can be cancelled from both sides of the equation.

The analysis proceeds from first principles as laid out in the problem statement.\n\nThe fundamental governing equations are:\n1.  **Ideal Gas Law**: The total molar concentration $c_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ is related to pressure $p$ and temperature $T$ by $c_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\dfrac{p}{R\\,T}$, where $R$ is the universal gas constant.\n2.  **Molar Concentrations**: For a species $i$, its molar concentration is $c_i = y_i c_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, where $y_i$ is its mole fraction.\n3.  **Reaction Rate**: The single global reaction $\\mathrm{H_2} + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\,\\mathrm{O_2} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{H_2O}$ proceeds at a rate of progress $\\omega$ given by the law of mass action:\n    $$\n    \\omega = k(T)\\,c_{\\mathrm{H_2}}^{a}\\,c_{\\mathrm{O_2}}^{b}\n    $$\n    The problem specifies the reaction orders as $a=1$ and $b=1$.\n4.  **Rate Constant**: The temperature-dependent rate constant $k(T)$ follows the Arrhenius law:\n    $$\n    k(T) = A\\,T^{n}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_{a}}{R\\,T}\\right)\n    $$\n    The problem provides the parameters $A = 10^{12}\\,\\mathrm{m^{3}\\,mol^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}$, $n = 0$, and $E_{a} = 1.6\\times 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$.\n5.  **Species Source Terms**: The rates of change of species concentrations are given by:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d c_{\\mathrm{H_2}}}{dt} = -\\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2}}\\,\\omega \\quad;\\quad\n    \\frac{d c_{\\mathrm{O_2}}}{dt} = -\\nu_{\\mathrm{O_2}}\\,\\omega \\quad;\\quad\n    \\frac{d c_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}}{dt} = +\\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}\\,\\omega\n    $$\n    with stoichiometric coefficients $\\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2}} = 1$, $\\nu_{\\mathrm{O_2}} = 0.5$, and $\\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} = 1$.\n\nThe system of ordinary differential equations can be written in vector form as $\\dfrac{d\\mathbf{c}}{dt} = \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{c})$, where the state vector is $\\mathbf{c} = \\begin{bmatrix} c_{\\mathrm{H_2}}  c_{\\mathrm{O_2}}  c_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} \\end{bmatrix}^T$ and the source term vector is $\\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{c}) = \\omega(\\mathbf{c}) \\mathbf{s}$, with $\\mathbf{s} = \\begin{bmatrix} -\\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2}}  -\\nu_{\\mathrm{O_2}}  \\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} \\end{bmatrix}^T = \\begin{bmatrix} -1  -0.5  1 \\end{bmatrix}^T$.\n\nThe primary task is to compute the spectral radius $\\rho(\\mathbf{J})$ of the Jacobian matrix $\\mathbf{J} = \\dfrac{\\partial \\mathbf{f}}{\\partial \\mathbf{c}}$. Since the stoichiometric vector $\\mathbf{s}$ is constant, the Jacobian can be derived using the product rule for vector calculus, which results in an outer product:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J} = \\frac{\\partial(\\omega \\mathbf{s})}{\\partial \\mathbf{c}} = \\mathbf{s} \\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial \\mathbf{c}} = \\mathbf{s} (\\nabla_{\\mathbf{c}} \\omega)^T\n$$\nwhere $\\nabla_{\\mathbf{c}} \\omega$ is the gradient of the scalar rate of progress $\\omega$ with respect to the concentration vector $\\mathbf{c}$. The components of this gradient are the partial derivatives of $\\omega$ with respect to each species concentration. With $\\omega = k(T) c_{\\mathrm{H_2}} c_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial c_{\\mathrm{H_2}}} = k(T) c_{\\mathrm{O_2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial c_{\\mathrm{O_2}}} = k(T) c_{\\mathrm{H_2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\omega}{\\partial c_{\\mathrm{H_2O}}} = 0\n$$\nThe gradient transpose is $(\\nabla_{\\mathbf{c}} \\omega)^T = \\begin{bmatrix} k(T) c_{\\mathrm{O_2}}  k(T) c_{\\mathrm{H_2}}  0 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n\nThe Jacobian matrix $\\mathbf{J}$ is thus the outer product:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J} = \\begin{bmatrix} -\\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2}} \\\\ -\\nu_{\\mathrm{O_2}} \\\\ \\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} k(T) c_{\\mathrm{O_2}}  k(T) c_{\\mathrm{H_2}}  0 \\end{bmatrix} = k(T) \\begin{bmatrix}\n-\\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2}} c_{\\mathrm{O_2}}  -\\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2}} c_{\\mathrm{H_2}}  0 \\\\\n-\\nu_{\\mathrm{O_2}} c_{\\mathrm{O_2}}  -\\nu_{\\mathrm{O_2}} c_{\\mathrm{H_2}}  0 \\\\\n\\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} c_{\\mathrm{O_2}}  \\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2O}} c_{\\mathrm{H_2}}  0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nA matrix formed by an outer product of two non-zero vectors is a rank-1 matrix. An $m \\times m$ rank-1 matrix has at most one non-zero eigenvalue. For a matrix $\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{u}\\mathbf{v}^T$, the non-zero eigenvalue is $\\lambda = \\mathbf{v}^T \\mathbf{u}$, and this eigenvalue is also equal to the trace of the matrix, $Tr(\\mathbf{A})$. In our case, the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{J}$ are $\\lambda_1 = Tr(\\mathbf{J})$ and $\\lambda_2 = \\lambda_3 = 0$.\n\nThe trace of the Jacobian is the sum of its diagonal elements:\n$$\nTr(\\mathbf{J}) = J_{11} + J_{22} + J_{33} = (-k(T)\\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2}} c_{\\mathrm{O_2}}) + (-k(T)\\nu_{\\mathrm{O_2}} c_{\\mathrm{H_2}}) + 0\n$$\n$$\nTr(\\mathbf{J}) = -k(T)(\\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2}} c_{\\mathrm{O_2}} + \\nu_{\\mathrm{O_2}} c_{\\mathrm{H_2}})\n$$\nThe eigenvalues are therefore $\\lambda_1 = -k(T)(\\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2}} c_{\\mathrm{O_2}} + \\nu_{\\mathrm{O_2}} c_{\\mathrm{H_2}})$, $\\lambda_2 = 0$, $\\lambda_3 = 0$.\nThe spectral radius is defined as $\\rho(\\mathbf{J}) = \\max_i |\\lambda_i|$. Since $k(T)$, all concentrations $c_i$, and all stoichiometric coefficients $\\nu_i$ are non-negative, the non-zero eigenvalue $\\lambda_1$ is always non-positive. Thus, the spectral radius is:\n$$\n\\rho(\\mathbf{J}) = |\\lambda_1| = k(T)(\\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2}} c_{\\mathrm{O_2}} + \\nu_{\\mathrm{O_2}} c_{\\mathrm{H_2}})\n$$\nThis analytical expression allows for the direct calculation of the spectral radius without numerically computing eigenvalues.\n\nThe computational procedure for each test case is as follows:\n1.  Given $T$, $p$, $y_{\\mathrm{H_2}}$, $y_{\\mathrm{O_2}}$, and $\\Delta t$.\n2.  Calculate the total molar concentration: $c_{\\mathrm{tot}} = p/(R T)$.\n3.  Calculate the species molar concentrations: $c_{\\mathrm{H_2}} = y_{\\mathrm{H_2}} c_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ and $c_{\\mathrm{O_2}} = y_{\\mathrm{O_2}} c_{\\mathrm{tot}}$.\n4.  Calculate the rate constant: $k(T) = A\\,\\exp(-E_a/(R T))$, since $n=0$.\n5.  Calculate the spectral radius using the derived formula: $\\rho(\\mathbf{J}) = k(T)(\\nu_{\\mathrm{H_2}} c_{\\mathrm{O_2}} + \\nu_{\\mathrm{O_2}} c_{\\mathrm{H_2}})$.\n6.  Assess the stability criterion: evaluate if $\\Delta t \\cdot \\rho(\\mathbf{J}) \\ge 1$. The result is a boolean value (`True` if the condition is met, `False` otherwise).\n\nThis algorithm is implemented for each provided test case.",
