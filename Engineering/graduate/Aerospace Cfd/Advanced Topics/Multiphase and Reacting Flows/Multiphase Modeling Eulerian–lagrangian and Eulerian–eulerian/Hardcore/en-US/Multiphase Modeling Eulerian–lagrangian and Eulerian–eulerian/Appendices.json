It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and complete. A solution will now be derived.\n\nThe motion of a single particle is governed by Newton's second law, which states that the particle's mass times its acceleration is equal to the sum of all external forces acting on it. In vector form, this is:\n$$ m_p \\frac{d\\boldsymbol{v}_p}{dt} = \\sum \\boldsymbol{F}_i $$\nwhere $m_p$ is the mass of the particle, $\\boldsymbol{v}_p$ is the particle velocity vector, and $\\sum \\boldsymbol{F}_i$ is the vector sum of forces.\n\nThe mass of a spherical particle is given by its density $\\rho_p$ multiplied by its volume $V_p$:\n$$ m_p = \\rho_p V_p = \\rho_p \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\pi d_p^3\\right) $$\nwhere $d_p$ is the particle diameter.\n\nThe problem specifies the forces to be considered:\n1.  **Gravitational Force ($\\boldsymbol{F}_g$):** The force due to gravity acting on the mass of the particle.\n    $$ \\boldsymbol{F}_g = m_p \\boldsymbol{g} = \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\pi d_p^3 \\rho_p\\right) \\boldsymbol{g} $$\n2.  **Buoyancy Force ($\\boldsymbol{F}_b$):** According to Archimedes' principle, this is the upward force exerted by the fluid, equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the particle. It acts in the direction opposite to gravity.\n    $$ \\boldsymbol{F}_b = -V_p \\rho_f \\boldsymbol{g} = -\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\pi d_p^3 \\rho_f\\right) \\boldsymbol{g} $$\n    The problem statement refers to \"gravity reduced by buoyancy,\" which is the net effect of these two forces:\n    $$ \\boldsymbol{F}_{gb} = \\boldsymbol{F}_g + \\boldsymbol{F}_b = \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\pi d_p^3 (\\rho_p - \\rho_f)\\right) \\boldsymbol{g} $$\n3.  **Viscous Drag Force ($\\boldsymbol{F}_d$):** Since the flow is in the low particle Reynolds number regime, the drag is described by Stokes' law. The drag force is proportional to the dynamic viscosity of the fluid $\\mu_f$, the particle diameter $d_p$, and the relative velocity between the fluid and the particle $(\\boldsymbol{u} - \\boldsymbol{v}_p)$.\n    $$ \\boldsymbol{F}_d = 3 \\pi \\mu_f d_p (\\boldsymbol{u} - \\boldsymbol{v}_p) $$\n\nAs per the problem statement, all other forces (added mass, Basset, Saffman lift, pressure gradient) are neglected. Assembling the equation of motion for the particle:\n$$ m_p \\frac{d\\boldsymbol{v}_p}{dt} = \\boldsymbol{F}_{gb} + \\boldsymbol{F}_d $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the mass and forces:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\pi d_p^3 \\rho_p\\right) \\frac{d\\boldsymbol{v}_p}{dt} = \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\pi d_p^3 (\\rho_p - \\rho_f)\\right) \\boldsymbol{g} + 3 \\pi \\mu_f d_p (\\boldsymbol{u} - \\boldsymbol{v}_p) $$\nTo simplify, we can divide the entire equation by the particle mass, $m_p$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\boldsymbol{v}_p}{dt} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{6}\\pi d_p^3 (\\rho_p - \\rho_f)}{\\frac{1}{6}\\pi d_p^3 \\rho_p} \\boldsymbol{g} + \\frac{3 \\pi \\mu_f d_p}{\\frac{1}{6}\\pi d_p^3 \\rho_p} (\\boldsymbol{u} - \\boldsymbol{v}_p) $$\n$$ \\frac{d\\boldsymbol{v}_p}{dt} = \\left(1 - \\frac{\\rho_f}{\\rho_p}\\right) \\boldsymbol{g} + \\frac{18 \\mu_f}{\\rho_p d_p^2} (\\boldsymbol{u} - \\boldsymbol{v}_p) $$\nThe term $\\frac{\\rho_p d_p^2}{18 \\mu_f}$ has units of time and represents the characteristic time for a particle to respond to changes in the fluid velocity. This is the particle viscous relaxation time, $\\tau_p$:\n$$ \\tau_p = \\frac{\\rho_p d_p^2}{18 \\mu_f} $$\nThe equation of motion can now be written compactly as:\n$$ \\frac{d\\boldsymbol{v}_p}{dt} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_p}(\\boldsymbol{u} - \\boldsymbol{v}_p) + \\left(1 - \\frac{\\rho_f}{\\rho_p}\\right) \\boldsymbol{g} $$\nThe problem asks to consider the limit of small Stokes number, $St = \\tau_p / T_{\\text{flow}} \\ll 1$. This implies that the particle relaxation time $\\tau_p$ is very small compared to the characteristic timescale of the flow $T_{\\text{flow}}$. In this limit, the particle's inertia is small, and it adjusts its velocity almost instantaneously to the local forces. The \"equilibrium slip\" $\\boldsymbol{v}_r$ is the slip velocity, $\\boldsymbol{v}_p - \\boldsymbol{u}$, that is achieved when the particle's acceleration is zero, i.e., when the drag force perfectly balances the net gravitational force. This equilibrium state is rapidly attained for particles with small $St$.\n\nTo find this equilibrium slip, we set the acceleration term $\\frac{d\\boldsymbol{v}_p}{dt}$ to zero in the equation of motion:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{0} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_p}(\\boldsymbol{u} - \\boldsymbol{v}_p) + \\left(1 - \\frac{\\rho_f}{\\rho_p}\\right) \\boldsymbol{g} $$\nWe are looking for the equilibrium slip velocity, which we define as $\\boldsymbol{v}_r = \\boldsymbol{v}_p - \\boldsymbol{u}$. Rearranging the equation to solve for this difference:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\tau_p}(\\boldsymbol{v}_p - \\boldsymbol{u}) = \\left(1 - \\frac{\\rho_f}{\\rho_p}\\right) \\boldsymbol{g} $$\n$$ \\boldsymbol{v}_r = \\boldsymbol{v}_p - \\boldsymbol{u} = \\tau_p \\left(1 - \\frac{\\rho_f}{\\rho_p}\\right) \\boldsymbol{g} $$\nNow, we substitute the expression for the particle relaxation time $\\tau_p$:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{v}_r = \\left(\\frac{\\rho_p d_p^2}{18 \\mu_f}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\rho_p - \\rho_f}{\\rho_p}\\right) \\boldsymbol{g} $$\nThe particle density $\\rho_p$ in the numerator and denominator cancels out:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{v}_r = \\frac{d_p^2 (\\rho_p - \\rho_f)}{18 \\mu_f} \\boldsymbol{g} $$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the vector equilibrium slip $\\boldsymbol{v}_r$. It represents the constant velocity difference between the particle and the fluid when the viscous drag force is in equilibrium with the buoyancy-reduced gravitational force.",

Consider a monodisperse ensemble of spherical liquid droplets of diameter $d_p$ dispersed in a gaseous continuous phase (phase $1$) with thermal conductivity $k_1$. The droplet (phase $2$) has a uniform surface temperature $T_2$, and the gas far from the droplet has a uniform temperature $T_1$. Assume negligible phase change, negligible internal droplet temperature gradients, and a thin, steady thermal boundary layer in the gas surrounding each droplet, such that the interfacial heat flux is governed locally by Fourier’s law.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the general form for the mixture-level interfacial heat transfer, $Q_{12}$, and subsequently an expression for the interfacial heat transfer coefficient, $h_i$.\n\nFirst, we consider the heat transfer from the continuous gas phase (phase $1$) to a single spherical droplet (phase $2$). The rate of heat transfer to a single particle, denoted as $\\dot{q}_p$, is described by Newton's law of cooling. This law relates the heat transfer rate to the temperature difference between the surrounding fluid and the body's surface via a convective heat transfer coefficient. The problem designates this coefficient as the interfacial heat transfer coefficient, $h_i$. For a single spherical droplet of diameter $d_p$, the surface area is $A_p = \\pi d_p^2$. The far-field gas temperature is $T_1$ and the droplet surface temperature is $T_2$. The heat transfer from the gas to the single droplet is therefore:\n$$\n\\dot{q}_p = h_i A_p (T_1 - T_2)\n$$\nwhere the temperature difference $(T_1 - T_2)$ ensures that the heat transfer rate $\\dot{q}_p$ is positive for heat flow from phase $1$ to phase $2$.\n\nThe quantity $Q_{12}$ is defined as the rate of heat transfer from phase $1$ to phase $2$ per unit mixture volume. To obtain this volumetric rate, we multiply the heat transfer rate for a single particle, $\\dot{q}_p$, by the number of particles per unit mixture volume, which we denote as $n_p$.\n$$\nQ_{12} = n_p \\dot{q}_p = n_p h_i A_p (T_1 - T_2)\n$$\n\nThe problem introduces the interfacial area density, $a_i$, defined as the total interfacial area per unit mixture volume. For a monodisperse system of spherical particles, this is the surface area of one particle, $A_p$, multiplied by the number of particles per unit volume, $n_p$.\n$$\na_i = n_p A_p\n$$\n\nSubstituting this definition into the expression for $Q_{12}$ yields the general form of the mixture-level interfacial heat transfer, which is a key source term in Eulerian-Eulerian multiphase models:\n$$\nQ_{12} = h_i a_i (T_1 - T_2)\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the derivation.\n\nNext, we must define the interfacial heat transfer coefficient, $h_i$, in terms of the given physical properties. The problem directs us to use the definition of the Nusselt number, $Nu$. The Nusselt number is a dimensionless quantity that represents the ratio of convective to conductive heat transfer across a boundary. For external flow over a body, it is defined as:\n$$\nNu = \\frac{h L_c}{k_f}\n$$\nwhere $h$ is the convective heat transfer coefficient, $L_c$ is the characteristic length of the body, and $k_f$ is the thermal conductivity of the surrounding fluid.\n\nIn the context of this specific problem:\n- The convective heat transfer coefficient is the interfacial coefficient, so $h = h_i$.\n- The characteristic length for a spherical particle is its diameter, so $L_c = d_p$.\n- The surrounding fluid is the continuous gas phase (phase $1$), so its thermal conductivity is $k_f = k_1$.\n\nSubstituting these specific terms into the general definition of the Nusselt number provides the relationship for this system:\n$$\nNu = \\frac{h_i d_p}{k_1}\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for a closed-form analytic expression for $h_i$. We can obtain this by algebraically rearranging the definition of the Nusselt number:\n$$\nh_i = Nu \\frac{k_1}{d_p}\n$$\nThis expression defines the interfacial heat transfer coefficient in terms of the dimensionless Nusselt number (which itself is typically found from empirical correlations involving the Reynolds and Prandtl numbers), the thermal conductivity of the continuous phase, and the diameter of the dispersed phase particles.
