            "problem": "A hypersonic flow over a Silicon Carbide (SiC) thermal protection surface is modeled using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). In the near-wall region of the boundary layer, atomic oxygen undergoes heterogeneous recombination at the SiC surface to form molecular oxygen.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation and calculation of a dimensionless measure that quantifies the competition between Fickian diffusion and a first-order surface reaction for the heterogeneous recombination of atomic oxygen on a Silicon Carbide ($\\mathrm{SiC}$) surface. This analysis is to be performed under steady-state conditions.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing this process is the conservation of mass at the surface. In a steady state, the rate at which atomic oxygen is supplied to the wall by diffusion must be equal to the rate at which it is consumed by the catalytic recombination reaction at the wall. This can be expressed as a balance of mass fluxes at the surface, which we define at the position $y=0$.\n\nLet $\\rho_{\\mathrm{O}}(y)$ be the mass concentration of atomic oxygen as a function of the distance $y$ normal to the wall. The mass flux of atomic oxygen due to diffusion, $J_{diff}$, is described by Fick's first law:\n$$J_{diff} = -D \\frac{d\\rho_{\\mathrm{O}}}{dy}$$\nwhere $D$ is the binary mass diffusivity of atomic oxygen, given as $D = 3.5 \\times 10^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{m^{2}/s}$.\n\nThe mass flux of atomic oxygen consumed by the surface reaction, $J_{reac}$, is described by a first-order kinetic law with respect to the concentration of atomic oxygen at the wall, $\\rho_{\\mathrm{O},w} = \\rho_{\\mathrm{O}}(y=0)$.\n$$J_{reac} = k_{s} \\rho_{\\mathrm{O},w}$$\nHere, $k_s$ is the surface rate constant, which has units of velocity ($\\mathrm{m/s}$).\n\nThe steady-state mass balance at the wall ($y=0$) requires the diffusive flux towards the wall to be equal to the reactive flux away from the gas phase (i.e., consumption). This gives the boundary condition:\n$$-D \\frac{d\\rho_{\\mathrm{O}}}{dy}\\bigg|_{y=0} = k_{s} \\rho_{\\mathrm{O},w}$$\n\nTo derive the required dimensionless number, we compare the characteristic rates of the two competing processes: diffusion and reaction.\n\nThe characteristic rate of the surface reaction can be represented by its mass flux, $J_{reac, char} = k_s \\rho_{\\mathrm{O},ref}$, where $\\rho_{\\mathrm{O},ref}$ is a suitable reference concentration (e.g., the wall concentration itself).\n\nThe characteristic rate of diffusion represents the maximum rate at which mass can be transported across the diffusion layer of characteristic thickness $L$. We can estimate the concentration gradient as $\\frac{d\\rho_{\\mathrm{O}}}{dy} \\sim \\frac{\\rho_{\\mathrm{O},ref}}{L}$. Thus, a characteristic diffusive flux is:\n$$J_{diff, char} = D \\frac{\\rho_{\\mathrm{O},ref}}{L}$$\nThis can be viewed as the product of a characteristic diffusion velocity, $V_{diff} = D/L$, and the reference concentration.\n\nThe dimensionless measure is the ratio of these two characteristic rates. This ratio is a form of the Damköhler number, denoted here as $Da$:\n$$Da = \\frac{\\text{Characteristic Surface Reaction Rate}}{\\text{Characteristic Diffusion Rate}} = \\frac{J_{reac, char}}{J_{diff, char}} = \\frac{k_s \\rho_{\\mathrm{O},ref}}{D \\rho_{\\mathrm{O},ref}/L}$$\nThe reference concentration $\\rho_{\\mathrm{O},ref}$ cancels out, yielding the final form of the dimensionless group:\n$$Da = \\frac{k_s L}{D}$$\nThis number compares the intrinsic \"velocity\" of the surface reaction, $k_s$, to the characteristic \"velocity\" of diffusion, $D/L$.\n\nThe physical meaning of the Damköhler number is as follows:\n-   If $Da \\gg 1$, the reaction is much faster than diffusion ($k_s \\gg D/L$). The overall process is limited by the rate at which reactants are supplied to the surface. This is the **diffusion-limited** regime.\n-   If $Da \\ll 1$, diffusion is much faster than the reaction ($k_s \\ll D/L$). The overall process is limited by the slow rate of the chemical reaction on the surface. This is the **reaction-limited** regime.\n\nTo compute the value of $Da$, we first need to calculate the surface rate constant $k_s$ at the given wall temperature $T_w = 2000 \\ \\mathrm{K}$. The rate constant is given by the Arrhenius equation:\n$$k_{s}(T) = k_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{a}}{R T}\\right)$$\nUsing the provided parameters:\n$k_{0} = 120 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}$\n$E_{a} = 4.0 \\times 10^{4} \\ \\mathrm{J/mol}$\n$R = 8.314 \\ \\mathrm{J/(mol \\cdot K)}$\n$T_w = 2000 \\ \\mathrm{K}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the dimensionless exponent:\n$$\\frac{E_{a}}{R T_w} = \\frac{4.0 \\times 10^{4} \\ \\mathrm{J/mol}}{(8.314 \\ \\mathrm{J/(mol \\cdot K)}) \\times (2000 \\ \\mathrm{K})} = \\frac{4.0 \\times 10^{4}}{16628} \\approx 2.405581$$\nNow, we find the value of $k_s$:\n$$k_s = (120 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}) \\times \\exp(-2.405581) \\approx (120 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}) \\times 0.090210 \\approx 10.8252 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}$$\nNext, we compute the Damköhler number $Da$ using the remaining parameters:\n$L = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{m}$\n$D = 3.5 \\times 10^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{m^{2}/s}$\n$$Da = \\frac{k_s L}{D} = \\frac{(10.8252 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{m})}{3.5 \\times 10^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s}}$$\n$$Da = \\frac{1.08252 \\times 10^{-2}}{3.5 \\times 10^{-2}} = \\frac{1.08252}{3.5} \\approx 0.30929$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get $Da \\approx 0.309$.\n\nSince the calculated value $Da \\approx 0.309$ is less than $1$, the characteristic reaction rate is smaller than the characteristic diffusion rate. This signifies that the overall heterogeneous recombination process is limited by the chemical kinetics at the surface. Therefore, the wall is classified as **reaction-limited**.",
