            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation and calculation of a key nondimensional parameter in unsteady aerodynamics, its numerical evaluation for a given hypersonic flight condition, and an assessment of the validity of a simplified aerodynamic theory based on this parameter's magnitude.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe governing equations for unsteady, inviscid, compressible flow (the Euler equations) contain both time-derivative terms ($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$) and convective terms (e.g., $\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla$). To identify the relevant nondimensional parameters, we nondimensionalize these equations.\n\nLet the reference length be the semi-chord, $b$, and the reference velocity be the freestream velocity, $U_\\infty$. The reference time is defined by the problem as the convective transit time across the semi-chord, which is $t_{ref} = \\frac{b}{U_\\infty}$.\n\nWe define the nondimensional variables (denoted by a bar) as:\n- Nondimensional time: $\\tau = \\frac{t}{t_{ref}} = \\frac{t U_\\infty}{b}$\n- Nondimensional spatial coordinates: e.g., $\\bar{x} = \\frac{x}{b}$\n\nThe chain rule is used to transform the derivatives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial \\tau}{\\partial t} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau} = \\frac{U_\\infty}{b} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial \\bar{x}}{\\partial x} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\bar{x}} = \\frac{1}{b} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\bar{x}} $$\nA convective term in the governing equations, such as the one in the momentum equation, has the form $U_\\infty \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}$. In nondimensional form, this becomes:\n$$ U_\\infty \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} = U_\\infty \\left( \\frac{1}{b} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\bar{x}} \\right) = \\frac{U_\\infty}{b} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\bar{x}} $$\nThe problem states that the control surface undergoes harmonic oscillation at an angular frequency $\\omega$. This implies that the flow variables have a time dependence of the form $e^{i \\omega t}$. When we substitute the nondimensional time $\\tau$ into this expression, we get:\n$$ e^{i \\omega t} = e^{i \\omega (b\\tau / U_\\infty)} = e^{i (\\omega b / U_\\infty) \\tau} $$\nThe time derivative of a variable $q$ that varies harmonically as $q \\propto e^{i \\omega t}$ is $\\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial t} = i\\omega q$.\n\nWhen the governing equations are nondimensionalized, the unsteady term $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ carries a factor of $\\frac{U_\\infty}{b}$ and the harmonic time dependence introduces a factor of $i \\omega$. More formally, the nondimensional representation of the time derivative operator applied to a harmonic function becomes:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\rightarrow \\frac{U_\\infty}{b} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\tau} \\rightarrow \\frac{U_\\infty}{b} \\left( i \\frac{\\omega b}{U_\\infty} \\right) = i\\omega $$\nThe ratio of the characteristic timescale of the flow transit ($t_{ref} = b/U_\\infty$) to the characteristic timescale of the oscillation ($T_{osc} = 1/f = 2\\pi/\\omega$) governs the degree of unsteadiness. The nondimensional parameter that emerges from this analysis is the coefficient of $\\tau$ in the exponent, which is defined as the reduced frequency, $k$.\n$$ k = \\frac{\\omega b}{U_\\infty} $$\nThis parameter represents the ratio of the convective time to the oscillation period (up to a factor of $2\\pi$). It is the fundamental parameter that quantifies the level of unsteadiness in an aerodynamic flow.\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are given the necessary values to compute $k$.\n1.  Calculate the freestream speed of sound, $a_\\infty$:\n    $$ a_\\infty = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_\\infty} $$\n    With $\\gamma = 1.4$, $R = 287\\ \\mathrm{J/(kg\\cdot K)}$, and $T_\\infty = 220\\ \\mathrm{K}$:\n    $$ a_\\infty = \\sqrt{1.4 \\times 287 \\times 220} = \\sqrt{88396}\\ \\mathrm{m/s} \\approx 297.3146\\ \\mathrm{m/s} $$\n\n2.  Calculate the freestream velocity, $U_\\infty$:\n    $$ U_\\infty = M_\\infty a_\\infty $$\n    With $M_\\infty = 8$:\n    $$ U_\\infty = 8 \\times \\sqrt{88396}\\ \\mathrm{m/s} \\approx 2378.517\\ \\mathrm{m/s} $$\n\n3.  Calculate the angular frequency, $\\omega$:\n    $$ \\omega = 2\\pi f $$\n    With $f = 50\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$:\n    $$ \\omega = 2\\pi(50) = 100\\pi\\ \\mathrm{rad/s} $$\n\n4.

The reduced frequency compares the time it takes for a fluid particle to travel over the characteristic length (the semi-chord $b$) with the period of the oscillation. A small value of $k$ signifies that the oscillation period is much longer than the flow transit time. In this case, the flow field has sufficient time to adjust almost instantaneously to the changes in the control surface's orientation.\n\nHypersonic piston theory is an approximation used for high-Mach-number flows. Its *quasi-steady* form calculates aerodynamic pressure based solely on the instantaneous local downwash (i.e., the component of surface velocity normal to the freestream), neglecting any time-history or \"memory\" effects of the flow. This quasi-steady assumption is valid precisely when the unsteadiness is low, as indicated by a small reduced frequency.\n\nSince the calculated reduced frequency $k \\approx 0.02642$ is significantly less than unity (and typically below the common threshold of $k \\approx 0.05$ where unsteady effects start to become noticeable), the flow can be considered quasi-steady. Therefore, using the simpler quasi-steady hypersonic piston theory would be an adequate approximation for calculating the aerodynamic loads in a coupled CFD-based aeroelastic analysis for this specific flight condition. Unsteady effects, while present, would be of a small order compared to the quasi-steady loads.",

For the motion to be bounded (i.e., stable sinusoidal oscillations), the coefficient of the $y(t)$ term must be non-negative. If this coefficient were negative, the solution would involve real exponentials, leading to unbounded growth. Thus, the condition for bounded oscillations is:\n$$\n\\omega_{\\text{eff}}^2 \\geq 0 \\implies \\omega_0^2 (1 - \\mu) \\geq 0\n$$\nSince $\\omega_0^2 = k/m_s > 0$ for any physical system, the stability condition simplifies to:\n$$\n1 - \\mu \\geq 0 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\mu \\leq 1\n$$\nThe mass ratio must be less than or equal to one for the scheme to produce bounded oscillations.\n\n4) Determination of the maximum chord length, $c_{\\max}$.\n\nThe condition for bounded oscillations derived in part $3$ is $\\mu \\leq 1$, which translates to $m_a/m_s \\leq 1$, or $m_a \\leq m_s$.\nFrom part $1$, we have the expression for the added mass per unit span, $m_a = \\rho \\pi b^2$. Given that the semi-chord is $b = c/2$, we can write $m_a$ in terms of the chord $c$:\n$$\nm_a = \\rho \\pi \\left(\\frac{c}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\rho \\pi c^2}{4}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the stability condition:\n$$\n\\frac{\\rho \\pi c^2}{4} \\leq m_s\n$$\nThe maximum chord length, $c_{\\max}$, that permits bounded oscillations is found at the limit of this inequality:\n$$\n\\frac{\\rho \\pi c_{\\max}^2}{4} = m_s\n$$\nWe solve this equation for $c_{\\max}$:\n$$\nc_{\\max}^2 = \\frac{4 m_s}{\\rho \\pi}\n$$\n$$\nc_{\\max} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4 m_s}{\\rho \\pi}} = 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{m_s}{\\rho \\pi}}\n$$\nThis closed-form analytic expression gives the maximum allowable chord length in terms of the structural mass per unit span $m_s$ and the fluid density $\\rho$. The expression is dimensionally consistent and provides a result with units of length (meters in SI units).",
