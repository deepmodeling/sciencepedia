The left end at $x=0$ is sealed by a perfectly fitting circular piston of mass $m_p$ that is guided without friction and attached to a linear spring of stiffness $k_s$ anchored to a fixed support.

            "solution": "### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- A rigid, horizontal, straight cylinder.\n- Constant cross-sectional area: $A$.\n- Length: $L$.\n- The cylinder is filled with an inviscid, incompressible fluid.\n- Fluid density: $\\rho$.\n- Right end at $x=L$ is open to a plenum with constant pressure $p_{\\infty}$.\n- Left end at $x=0$ is sealed by a piston.\n- Piston mass: $m_p$.\n- The piston is attached to a linear spring of stiffness $k_s$.\n- Piston undergoes small-amplitude axial motion $x(t)$ about its equilibrium position.\n- $x(t)$ is the piston displacement into the cylinder (positive $x$-direction).\n- Neglect gravity, viscous effects, and thermal effects.\n- One-dimensional plug flow is assumed: $u(x,t) \\equiv \\dot{x}(t)$ for $0 \\le x \\le L$.\n- The plenum pressure remains $p_{\\infty}$ at $x=L$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. It describes a classical mechanical oscillator (mass-spring system) coupled with a fluid column. The governing principles are Newton's second law and the conservation of mass and momentum for a fluid, which are fundamental to physics and engineering.\n\nThe problem is well-posed. The assumptions provided (inviscid, incompressible, 1D plug flow, small oscillations) are standard simplifying assumptions used to reduce a complex fluid-structure interaction problem to a linear ordinary differential equation, for which a unique solution for the natural frequency exists.\n\nThe problem is objective. The language is precise, and the parameters are clearly defined. There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\nThe problem setup is self-contained and consistent. All necessary parameters ($A$, $L$, $\\rho$, $p_{\\infty}$, $m_p$, $k_s$) are provided to derive the equation of motion and the natural frequency. The kinematic constraint $u(x,t) = \\dot{x}(t)$ is consistent with the incompressibility of the fluid in a constant-area duct with one moving boundary and one open boundary.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Equation of Motion\n\nThe objective is to derive the linear equation of motion for the piston displacement $x(t)$ and find the natural frequency $\\omega_n$ of the system. This requires applying Newton's second law to the piston and the conservation of linear momentum to the fluid column.\n\n**1. Fluid Dynamics: Conservation of Linear Momentum**\n\nWe apply the integral form of the linear momentum equation in the $x$-direction to a fixed control volume (CV) encompassing the fluid within the cylinder, from $x=0$ to $x=L$. The momentum equation for a fixed CV is:\n$$\n\\sum F_x = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\int_{\\text{CV}} \\rho u \\, dV + \\int_{\\text{CS}} (\\rho u) (\\vec{v} \\cdot d\\vec{A})\n$$\nwhere $\\sum F_x$ is the sum of external surface forces on the fluid in the $x$-direction, $u$ is the $x$-component of the fluid velocity $\\vec{v}$, and the integrals are over the control volume (CV) and control surface (CS).\n\n- **Surface Forces ($\\sum F_x$):**\nThe external forces acting on the fluid in the control volume are due to pressure at the boundaries $x=0$ and $x=L$. The force at $x=0$ is $p(0, t)A$ acting in the positive $x$-direction. The force at $x=L$ is $p(L, t)A = p_{\\infty}A$ acting in the negative $x$-direction. Viscous forces are neglected.\n$$\n\\sum F_x = p(0, t) A - p_{\\infty} A\n$$\n\n- **Rate of Change of Momentum in CV:**\nThe fluid velocity is spatially uniform (plug flow), $u(t) = \\dot{x}(t)$. The volume element is $dV = A \\, dx$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\int_{\\text{CV}} \\rho u \\, dV = \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{0}^{L} \\rho \\dot{x}(t) A \\, dx = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left[ \\rho \\dot{x}(t) A L \\right]\n$$\nSince $\\rho$, $A$, and $L$ are constants, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\left[ \\rho A L \\dot{x}(t) \\right] = \\rho A L \\ddot{x}(t)\n$$\n\n- **Momentum Flux across CS:**\nThe momentum flux is calculated at the inlet ($x=0$) and outlet ($x=L$). The velocity vector is $\\vec{v} = u(t)\\hat{i} = \\dot{x}(t)\\hat{i}$.\nAt the inlet ($x=0$): $d\\vec{A} = -A\\hat{i}$. The flux is $\\int_{A} (\\rho u) (\\vec{v} \\cdot d\\vec{A}) = \\rho \\dot{x}(t) (\\dot{x}(t)\\hat{i} \\cdot (-A\\hat{i})) = -\\rho A (\\dot{x}(t))^2$.\nAt the outlet ($x=L$): $d\\vec{A} = A\\hat{i}$. The flux is $\\int_{A} (\\rho u) (\\vec{v} \\cdot d\\vec{A}) = \\rho \\dot{x}(t) (\\dot{x}(t)\\hat{i} \\cdot (A\\hat{i})) = \\rho A (\\dot{x}(t))^2$.\nThe net momentum flux across the control surface is the sum of these two terms:\n$$\n\\int_{\\text{CS}} (\\rho u) (\\vec{v} \\cdot d\\vec{A}) = \\rho A (\\dot{x}(t))^2 - \\rho A (\\dot{x}(t))^2 = 0\n$$\n\n- **Assembling the Fluid Momentum Equation:**\nSubstituting all terms back into the momentum equation:\n$$\np(0, t) A - p_{\\infty} A = \\rho A L \\ddot{x}(t) + 0\n$$\nThis gives a relationship between the pressure at $x=0$ and the fluid acceleration:\n$$\np(0, t) - p_{\\infty} = \\rho L \\ddot{x}(t)\n$$\n\n**2. Piston Dynamics: Newton's Second Law**\n\nWe apply Newton's second law, $\\sum F_x = m_p \\ddot{x}(t)$, to the piston of mass $m_p$. The piston is located at position $x(t)$. The forces acting on the piston in the $x$-direction are:\n- **Spring Force:** The spring opposes the displacement from equilibrium. Force is $-k_s x(t)$.\n- **Pressure Force from Fluid:** The fluid pressure $p(x(t), t)$ acts on the face of the piston, creating a force $-p(x(t), t)A$.\n- **Pressure Force on Back of Piston:** It is implicit that the back of the piston is exposed to the same large plenum pressure $p_{\\infty}$. This creates a force $p_{\\infty}A$.\n\nThe equation of motion for the piston is:\n$$\nm_p \\ddot{x}(t) = -k_s x(t) - p(x(t), t)A + p_{\\infty}A\n$$\n$$\nm_p \\ddot{x}(t) = -k_s x(t) - (p(x(t), t) - p_{\\infty})A\n$$\nFor small-amplitude oscillations, the piston displacement $x(t)$ is small. The pressure difference between the piston's instantaneous position $x(t)$ and the fixed reference $x=0$ is negligible. That is, $p(x(t), t) \\approx p(0, t)$, because any pressure gradient term multiplied by the small displacement $x(t)$ would be a second-order effect, which we neglect in a linear analysis. Thus, we can write:\n$$\nm_p \\ddot{x}(t) \\approx -k_s x(t) - (p(0, t) - p_{\\infty})A\n$$\n\n**3. Coupling the Equations and Finding the Natural Frequency**\n\nWe now substitute the result from the fluid momentum equation into the piston's equation of motion.\n$$\np(0, t) - p_{\\infty} = \\rho L \\ddot{x}(t)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the piston equation:\n$$\nm_p \\ddot{x}(t) = -k_s x(t) - (\\rho L \\ddot{x}(t))A\n$$\nRearranging the terms to the standard form of a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation:\n$$\nm_p \\ddot{x}(t) + \\rho A L \\ddot{x}(t) + k_s x(t) = 0\n$$\n$$\n(m_p + \\rho A L) \\ddot{x}(t) + k_s x(t) = 0\n$$\nThis is the linear equation of motion for the coupled system. It is in the form $M_{\\text{eff}} \\ddot{x}(t) + K_{\\text{eff}} x(t) = 0$.\n\n- **Effective Mass and Added Mass:**\nThe effective mass of the oscillating system is $M_{\\text{eff}} = m_p + \\rho A L$. The term $\\rho A L$ is the mass of the entire fluid column in the cylinder. This is the **added mass**, $m_{\\text{added}}$, contributed by the fluid that must be accelerated along with the piston.\n$$\nm_{\\text{added}} = \\rho A L\n$$\n\n- **Natural Angular Frequency:**\nThe natural angular frequency, $\\omega_n$, of a simple harmonic oscillator described by $M \\ddot{x} + K x = 0$ is given by $\\omega_n = \\sqrt{K/M}$. For our system:\n- Effective stiffness $K_{\\text{eff}} = k_s$.\n- Effective mass $M_{\\text{eff}} = m_p + \\rho A L$.\n\nTherefore, the natural angular frequency of the small free oscillations is:\n$$\n\\omega_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{K_{\\text{eff}}}{M_{\\text{eff}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_s}{m_p + \\rho A L}}\n$$\nThis expression provides the natural frequency in radians per second in terms of the given system parameters.",

            "solution": "The problem presents a simplified one-dimensional model of Fluid–Structure Interaction (FSI), a topic of significant interest in aerospace Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The model consists of a piston-spring system coupled with a fluid column. The fluid's inertial effect is modeled as an added mass. The task is to analyze the numerical stability of two different time-integration schemes for this system: a monolithic implicit scheme and a loosely coupled partitioned scheme.\n\nThe problem statement has been validated and is deemed sound. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of classical mechanics and numerical analysis, well-posed with clear objectives, and uses precise, objective language. All necessary data and definitions are provided. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe governing equation for the coupled system is given as:\n$$\n(m_s + m_f) \\ddot{x}(t) + k x(t) = 0\n$$\nwhere $m_s$ is the structural mass of the piston, $m_f = \\rho_f A L$ is the added mass of the fluid, $k$ is the spring stiffness, and $x(t)$ is the piston displacement. This is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator with total mass $M = m_s + m_f$ and natural frequency $\\omega_n = \\sqrt{k/M}$.\n\n(a) Monolithic Implicit Scheme\n\nFor the monolithic scheme, the entire system of equations is solved simultaneously at each time step. We use the backward Euler method for time discretization. Let us first represent the second-order Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) as a system of two first-order ODEs. Let the state vector be $\\mathbf{y}(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} x(t) \\\\ v(t) \\end{pmatrix}$, where $v(t) = \\dot{x}(t)$ is the velocity.\n\nThe system is:\n$$\n\\dot{\\mathbf{y}}(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\dot{x}(t) \\\\ \\dot{v}(t) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -\\frac{k}{m_s + m_f} & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x(t) \\\\ v(t) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe backward Euler discretization with a time step $\\Delta t$ is defined by $\\mathbf{y}^{n+1} = \\mathbf{y}^n + \\Delta t \\dot{\\mathbf{y}}^{n+1}$. Applying this to our system:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} x^{n+1} \\\\ v^{n+1} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} x^n \\\\ v^n \\end{pmatrix} + \\Delta t \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -\\frac{k}{m_s + m_f} & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x^{n+1} \\\\ v^{n+1} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis can be rearranged to solve for the state at time step $n+1$:\n$$\n\\left( \\mathbf{I} - \\Delta t \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ -\\frac{k}{m_s + m_f} & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) \\begin{pmatrix} x^{n+1} \\\\ v^{n+1} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} x^n \\\\ v^n \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -\\Delta t \\\\ \\frac{k \\Delta t}{m_s + m_f} & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x^{n+1} \\\\ v^{n+1} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} x^n \\\\ v^n \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe update from step $n$ to $n+1$ is thus governed by the inverse of the matrix on the left, which is the amplification matrix $\\mathbf{G}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{G} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -\\Delta t \\\\ \\frac{k \\Delta t}{m_s + m_f} & 1 \\end{pmatrix}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{k (\\Delta t)^2}{m_s + m_f}} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & \\Delta t \\\\ -\\frac{k \\Delta t}{m_s + m_f} & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor linear stability, the spectral radius of the amplification matrix, $\\rho(\\mathbf{G})$, must be less than or equal to $1$. The eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of $\\mathbf{G}$ are found from the characteristic equation $\\det(\\mathbf{G} - \\lambda \\mathbf{I}) = 0$. Using the form of $\\mathbf{G}$ before taking the inverse, the eigenvalues of the matrix on the left are $\\lambda_L = 1 \\pm i \\Delta t \\sqrt{k/(m_s+m_f)}$, so the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{G}$ are $\\lambda = 1/\\lambda_L$.\nThe magnitude of the eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{G}$ is:\n$$\n|\\lambda| = \\frac{1}{|1 \\pm i \\Delta t \\sqrt{k/(m_s+m_f)}|} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1^2 + \\left( \\Delta t \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m_s+m_f}} \\right)^2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + \\frac{k (\\Delta t)^2}{m_s+m_f}}}\n$$\nFor the scheme to be stable, we require $|\\lambda| \\le 1$. This condition is satisfied provided $1 + \\frac{k (\\Delta t)^2}{m_s+m_f} \\ge 1$. Since $k \\ge 0$, $(\\Delta t)^2 > 0$, and for any physical system $m_s+m_f > 0$, this inequality always holds. The numerical scheme is therefore unconditionally stable for any physically meaningful and non-negative values of $m_s$, $m_f$, and $k$.\n\nThe stability of the monolithic scheme depends only on the total mass $m_s+m_f$, not on the individual values of $m_s$ or $m_f$ or their ratio. As long as the total mass is positive, the scheme is stable. The physical constraint on mass is $m_s \\ge 0$. The numerical scheme imposes no additional lower bound. Therefore, the minimum structural mass for stability is zero.\n$$\nm_{s,\\text{min}}^{\\text{mono}} = 0\n$$\n\n(b) Loosely Coupled Partitioned Scheme\n\nIn this scheme, the fluid and structure equations are solved sequentially. The fluid force on the structure at step $n+1$ is calculated using the structural acceleration from the previous step, $n$. The total force on the piston is from the spring and the fluid. Newton's second law for the structure's mass $m_s$ is:\n$$\nm_s \\ddot{x}(t) + k x(t) = F_f(t)\n$$\nwhere the fluid force is $F_f(t) = -m_f \\ddot{x}(t)$. The partitioned scheme discretizes this as:\n$$\nm_s \\ddot{x}^{n+1} + k x^{n+1} = -m_f \\ddot{x}^n\n$$\nThe problem directs us to consider the case where the spring stiffness is zero, $k=0$, to isolate the instability arising from the fluid-structure coupling itself (the \"artificial added mass\" instability). Setting $k=0$, the equation becomes:\n$$\nm_s \\ddot{x}^{n+1} = -m_f \\ddot{x}^n\n$$\nLet $a^n = \\ddot{x}^n$ be the acceleration at time step $n$. The update rule for acceleration from one step to the next is:\n$$\na^{n+1} = \\left(-\\frac{m_f}{m_s}\\right) a^n\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear recurrence relation. For the sequence of accelerations $\\{a^n\\}$ to be stable (i.e., not grow without bound), the magnitude of the amplification factor must be less than or equal to $1$.\n$$\n\\left| -\\frac{m_f}{m_s} \\right| \\le 1\n$$\nSince masses $m_s$ and $m_f$ are non-negative, and $m_s$ must be positive to avoid division by zero, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{m_f}{m_s} \\le 1\n$$\nThis implies a necessary condition for the stability of the loosely coupled partitioned scheme:\n$$\nm_s \\ge m_f\n$$\nThe structural mass must be greater than or equal to the added mass of the fluid. This dictates a non-zero lower bound on $m_s$ for stability. The minimal structural mass required is equal to the fluid added mass.\n$$\nm_{s,\\text{min}}^{\\text{part}} = m_f\n$$\n\n(c) Difference in Stability Bounds\n\nWe are asked to compute the difference $\\Delta m = m_{s,\\text{min}}^{\\text{part}} - m_{s,\\text{min}}^{\\text{mono}}$.\nUsing the results from parts (a) and (b):\n$$\n\\Delta m = m_f - 0 = m_f\n$$\nThe added mass $m_f$ is defined as $m_f = \\rho_f A L$.

We must first formulate the inertial balance, argue the consequence of neglecting the mesh acceleration term, and then calculate a minimum frequency at which this term becomes non-negligible based on a given criterion.\n\nFirst, let us establish the correct form of the momentum equation in an accelerating reference frame. The ALE mesh, which conforms to the oscillating panel, constitutes a non-inertial reference frame because its points are accelerating. Newton's second law, $\\mathbf{F}_{\\text{real}} = m \\mathbf{a}_{\\text{inertial}}$, is valid only in an inertial frame. The acceleration of a fluid particle in an inertial frame, $\\mathbf{a}_{\\text{inertial}}$, can be related to its acceleration as observed in the non-inertial (ALE) frame, $\\mathbf{a}_{\\text{non-inertial}}$.

Thus:\n$$\n\\mathbf{a}_{\\text{non-inertial}} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} \\bigg|_{\\text{ALE}} + ((\\mathbf{u} - \\mathbf{w}) \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u}\n$$\nThe complete and correct momentum equation for the fluid in the accelerating ALE frame is therefore:\n$$\n\\rho \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + ((\\mathbf{u} - \\mathbf{w}) \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} \\right) = \\mathbf{f}_{\\text{real}} - \\rho \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{w}}{\\partial t}\n$$\nThis can be rearranged to group all inertial terms on one side:\n$$\n\\rho \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + ((\\mathbf{u} - \\mathbf{w}) \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} + \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{w}}{\\partial t} \\right) = \\mathbf{f}_{\\text{real}}\n$$\nThis formulation shows that the total inertial acceleration of the fluid per unit volume is the sum of the local fluid velocity change rate relative to the mesh, the convective acceleration relative to the mesh, and the acceleration of the mesh itself.\n\nIf a numerical solver neglects the mesh acceleration term, it solves an incomplete momentum equation: $\\rho \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}}{\\partial t} + ((\\mathbf{u} - \\mathbf{w}) \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u} \\right) = \\mathbf{f}_{\\text{real}}$. This means that the real forces are balancing only part of the fluid's total inertia. The term $\\rho \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{w}}{\\partial t}$ is left unbalanced, which introduces an error in the form of an un-accounted-for acceleration of magnitude $|\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{w}}{\\partial t}|$. This error is particularly significant in cases of high-frequency or high-amplitude structural motion.\n\nNext, we estimate the magnitude of this error relative to the convective inertial scale, $U^2/L$. The error ratio is defined as:\n$$\nR \\equiv \\frac{|\\partial w/\\partial t|}{U^{2}/L}\n$$\nThe panel's normal displacement is given as a single harmonic mode:\n$$\nd(t) = a \\sin(\\omega t)\n$$\nThe corresponding normal velocity of the mesh at the panel surface is the time derivative of the displacement:\n$$\nw_n(t) = \\dot{d}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} (a \\sin(\\omega t)) = a \\omega \\cos(\\omega t)\n$$\nThe normal acceleration of the mesh at the panel is the second time derivative of displacement:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial w_n}{\\partial t} = \\ddot{d}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} (a \\omega \\cos(\\omega t)) = -a \\omega^2 \\sin(\\omega t)\n$$\nFor scaling purposes, we consider the maximum magnitude of this acceleration over a cycle, which occurs when $|\\sin(\\omega t)| = 1$:\n$$\n\\left| \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial t} \\right|_{\\text{char}} = a \\omega^2\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{a \\omega^2}{U^2 / L} = \\frac{a \\omega^2 L}{U^2}\n$$\nThe problem states that the mesh acceleration term is non-negligible when $R \\ge \\varepsilon$, where $\\varepsilon = 0.1$. We need to find the minimum angular frequency, $\\omega^{\\star}$, for which this condition holds. This minimum is found at the equality:\n$$\n\\frac{a (\\omega^{\\star})^2 L}{U^2} = \\varepsilon\n$$\nSolving for $\\omega^{\\star}$:\n$$\n(\\omega^{\\star})^2 = \\frac{\\varepsilon U^2}{a L} \\implies \\omega^{\\star} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon U^2}{a L}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given physical parameters:\n- $\\varepsilon = 0.1$\n- $U = 60$ m/s\n- $L = 0.20$ m\n- $a = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}$ m\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n$$\n\\omega^{\\star} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.1 \\times (60)^2}{(1.0 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times 0.20}}\n$$\n$$\n\\omega^{\\star} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.1 \\times 3600}{2.0 \\times 10^{-4}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{360}{2.0 \\times 10^{-4}}}\n$$\n$$\n\\omega^{\\star} = \\sqrt{180 \\times 10^4} = \\sqrt{1.8 \\times 10^6} = \\sqrt{1.8} \\times 10^3\n$$\nNumerically, $\\sqrt{1.8} \\approx 1.34164$.\n$$\n\\omega^{\\star} \\approx 1.34164 \\times 10^3 \\, \\text{rad/s} \\approx 1341.64 \\, \\text{rad/s}\n$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures as requested gives $1340$ rad/s. Expressed in scientific notation, this is $1.34 \\times 10^3$ rad/s.",
