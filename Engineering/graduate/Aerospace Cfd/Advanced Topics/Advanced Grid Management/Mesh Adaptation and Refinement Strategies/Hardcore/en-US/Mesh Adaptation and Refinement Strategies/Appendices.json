The asymptotic error model is the fundamental assumption of this method. The procedure is well-documented in the scientific literature (e.g., by Roache, Celik, et al.).\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary data ($Q_1, Q_2, Q_3, r, F_s$) to uniquely determine the required quantities ($p$ and $\\text{GCI}_{32}$). The condition that the convergence is monotonic is met by the data ($0.142 > 0.138 > 0.1365$), which is a prerequisite for the standard application of the method.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, technical language, free from subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. It is a valid problem in numerical methods and computational fluid dynamics. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution requires executing the three tasks specified in the problem statement.\n\n**1. Derivation and Computation of the Observed Order of Accuracy, $p$**\n\nThe solution is assumed to be in the asymptotic range, where the error is dominated by the leading term. The error model is given by $Q(h) \\approx Q^{\\ast} + K h^{p}$. We can write this expression for the three grids:\n$$Q_1 \\approx Q^{\\ast} + K h_1^{p}$$\n$$Q_2 \\approx Q^{\\ast} + K h_2^{p}$$\n$$Q_3 \\approx Q^{\\ast} + K h_3^{p}$$\nTo eliminate the unknown exact solution $Q^{\\ast}$, we take the differences between solutions on successive grids:\n$$Q_1 - Q_2 \\approx K (h_1^p - h_2^p)$$\n$$Q_2 - Q_3 \\approx K (h_2^p - h_3^p)$$\nNext, we take the ratio of these differences to eliminate the unknown constant $K$:\n$$\\frac{Q_1 - Q_2}{Q_2 - Q_3} \\approx \\frac{h_1^p - h_2^p}{h_2^p - h_3^p}$$\nUsing the constant grid refinement ratio, $r = h_1/h_2 = h_2/h_3$, we can express $h_1$ and $h_3$ in terms of $h_2$: $h_1 = r h_2$ and $h_3 = h_2/r$. Substituting these into the ratio:\n$$\\frac{Q_1 - Q_2}{Q_2 - Q_3} \\approx \\frac{(r h_2)^p - h_2^p}{h_2^p - (h_2/r)^p} = \\frac{h_2^p (r^p - 1)}{h_2^p (1 - r^{-p})} = \\frac{r^p - 1}{(r^p - 1)/r^p} = r^p$$\nThis provides the formula for $p$. To solve for $p$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{Q_1 - Q_2}{Q_2 - Q_3}\\right) \\approx p \\ln(r)$$\nThus, the derived formula for the observed order of accuracy is:\n$$p \\approx \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{Q_1 - Q_2}{Q_2 - Q_3}\\right)}{\\ln(r)}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $Q_1 = 0.142$, $Q_2 = 0.138$, $Q_3 = 0.1365$, and $r = 2$.\n$$p \\approx \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{0.142 - 0.138}{0.138 - 0.1365}\\right)}{\\ln(2)} = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{0.004}{0.0015}\\right)}{\\ln(2)} = \\frac{\\ln(8/3)}{\\ln(2)}$$\nComputing the numerical value:\n$$p \\approx \\frac{0.980829253}{0.693147181} \\approx 1.415037499$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $p \\approx 1.415$.\n\n**2. Derivation and Computation of the Richardson Extrapolation, $Q_{\\text{ext}}$**\n\nWe use the two finest grid solutions, $Q_2$ and $Q_3$, to find the extrapolated value, which we denote as $Q_{\\text{ext}}$. The model gives:\n$$Q_2 \\approx Q_{\\text{ext}} + K h_2^{p}$$\n$$Q_3 \\approx Q_{\\text{ext}} + K h_3^{p}$$\nUsing $h_2 = r h_3$, the first equation becomes $Q_2 \\approx Q_{\\text{ext}} + K (r h_3)^{p} = Q_{\\text{ext}} + K r^p h_3^p$. To eliminate $K$, we multiply the second equation by $r^p$:\n$$r^p Q_3 \\approx r^p Q_{\\text{ext}} + K r^p h_3^p$$\nSubtracting the expression for $Q_2$ from this yields:\n$$r^p Q_3 - Q_2 \\approx (r^p Q_{\\text{ext}} - Q_{\\text{ext}}) = Q_{\\text{ext}}(r^p - 1)$$\nSolving for $Q_{\\text{ext}}$, we derive the two-grid Richardson extrapolation formula:\n$$Q_{\\text{ext}} = \\frac{r^p Q_3 - Q_2}{r^p - 1}$$\nThis can be rewritten to show the correction to the fine-grid solution:\n$$Q_{\\text{ext}} = Q_3 + \\frac{Q_3 - Q_2}{r^p - 1}$$\nWe compute the numerical value of $Q_{\\text{ext}}$ using the exact ratio $r^p = 8/3$ from the previous step, along with $Q_2 = 0.138$ and $Q_3 = 0.1365$:\n$$Q_{\\text{ext}} = 0.1365 + \\frac{0.1365 - 0.138}{(8/3) - 1} = 0.1365 + \\frac{-0.0015}{5/3} = 0.1365 - (0.0015 \\times \\frac{3}{5}) = 0.1365 - 0.0009 = 0.1356$$\nSo, the extrapolated value is $Q_{\\text{ext}} = 0.1356$.\n\n**3. Grid Convergence Index ($\\text{GCI}_{32}$)**\n\nThe Grid Convergence Index (GCI) provides a measure of the uncertainty of the fine-grid solution due to discretization error. The standard steps to compute the fine-grid GCI for the pair $(h_3, h_2)$, denoted $\\text{GCI}_{32}$, are as follows:\n- **Step A:** Compute the apparent order of accuracy, $p$, using the three-grid solution data. This was completed in Part 1.\n- **Step B:** Compute the relative difference between the two finest grid solutions, $Q_2$ and $Q_3$. The standard formulation normalizes by the fine-grid solution:\n  $$e_{a,32} = \\left| \\frac{Q_3 - Q_2}{Q_3} \\right|$$\n- **Step C:** Apply the GCI formula, which scales this relative difference by a factor that includes the safety factor $F_s$ and the refinement ratio $r$ raised to the power $p$:\n  $$\\text{GCI}_{32} = \\frac{F_s |e_{a,32}|}{r^p - 1} = \\frac{F_s}{r^p - 1} \\left| \\frac{Q_3 - Q_2}{Q_3} \\right|$$\nThe safety factor $F_s$ accounts for the fact that the solution may not be perfectly in the asymptotic range. A value of $F_s = 1.25$ is recommended when the observed order $p$ is close to the formal order of the scheme, and $F_s=3$ is used when $p$ is not well-determined or varies significantly. Here, $F_s=1.25$ is given.\n\nNow we compute the numerical value of $\\text{GCI}_{32}$ using the given data and intermediate results:\n$F_s = 1.25$, $r^p = 8/3$, $Q_2 = 0.138$, $Q_3 = 0.1365$.\n$$\\text{GCI}_{32} = \\frac{1.25}{(8/3) - 1} \\left| \\frac{0.1365 - 0.138}{0.1365} \\right| = \\frac{1.25}{5/3} \\left| \\frac{-0.0015}{0.1365} \\right|$$\n$$\\text{GCI}_{32} = (1.25 \\times \\frac{3}{5}) \\left(\\frac{0.0015}{0.1365}\\right) = 0.75 \\times \\frac{15}{1365} = 0.75 \\times \\frac{1}{91}$$\nComputing the final numerical value:\n$$\\text{GCI}_{32} \\approx 0.00824175824$$\nAs a dimensionless decimal fraction, and rounding to four significant figures, we get $\\text{GCI}_{32} \\approx 0.008242$. This value implies an estimated uncertainty of approximately $0.82\\%$ in the fine-grid solution $Q_3$.\n\nThe final requested values are $p$ and $\\text{GCI}_{32}$, rounded to four significant figures.\n$p \\approx 1.415$\n$\\text{GCI}_{32} \\approx 0.008242$",

            "solution": "The problem is found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and self-contained. All provided data are consistent and sufficient for arriving at a unique solution. The problem statement describes a standard procedure in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for adaptive mesh refinement, and a solution can be derived through a rigorous, step-by-step logical deduction.\n\nThe task is to determine the number of elements to be refined in a single mesh adaptation cycle. This number depends on two factors: the set of elements eligible for refinement based on physical criteria, and the memory budget that constrains the total number of refined elements.\n\nFirst, we must identify the criteria that an element $K$ must satisfy to be considered eligible for refinement. The problem specifies two constraints:\n1.  An anisotropy constraint: $a_K \\leq 3$.\n2.  A shock sensor constraint: $s_K = 1$.\n\nLet us analyze the first constraint. The anisotropy measure $a_K$ is given by the empirical relation $a_K = 1 + 4(1 - \\eta_K)$. Substituting this into the inequality gives:\n$$1 + 4(1 - \\eta_K) \\leq 3$$\n$$4(1 - \\eta_K) \\leq 2$$\n$$1 - \\eta_K \\leq \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$\\eta_K \\geq \\frac{1}{2}$$\nSo, the first constraint requires the element's error indicator $\\eta_K$ to be at least $0.5$.\n\nThe second constraint requires the shock sensor $s_K$ to be equal to $1$. The problem states that $s_K=1$ \"precisely on the high-gradient component of the mixture\". This means that only elements from the high-gradient population are candidates for refinement.\n\nNow, we must determine which elements satisfy both constraints simultaneously. The total population of $M = 2.5 \\times 10^5$ elements is described by a mixture model with two components:\n\n- **Smooth region population**: This group constitutes a fraction $p_c = 0.7$ of the total elements. For these elements, the error indicator $\\eta_K$ is uniformly distributed on the interval $[0.0, 0.5]$. By definition, the shock sensor for this population is $s_K = 0$. Since this violates the second constraint ($s_K=1$), no element from the smooth region is eligible for refinement.\n\n- **High-gradient/shock-affected population**: This group constitutes a fraction $p_h = 0.3$ of the total elements. For these elements, the error indicator $\\eta_K$ is uniformly distributed on the interval $[0.6, 1.0]$. The shock sensor for this population is $s_K = 1$, which satisfies the second constraint. We must also check if these elements satisfy the first constraint, $\\eta_K \\geq 0.5$. Since the range of $\\eta_K$ for this population is $[0.6, 1.0]$, every value within this range is greater than $0.5$. Therefore, all elements in the high-gradient population satisfy both constraints.\n\nFrom this analysis, we conclude that the set of elements eligible for refinement is exactly the set of all elements belonging to the high-gradient population. We can calculate the total number of such elements, denoted $N_{\\text{eligible}}$:\n$$N_{\\text{eligible}} = p_h \\times M$$\nSubstituting the given values, $p_h = 0.3$ and $M = 2.5 \\times 10^5$:\n$$N_{\\text{eligible}} = 0.3 \\times (2.5 \\times 10^5) = 75000$$\nThere are $75000$ elements eligible for refinement.\n\nNext, we consider the memory budget. The problem states that at most a fraction $\\beta = 0.12$ of the total elements may be refined in a single cycle. This imposes an upper limit on the number of elements that can be refined, which we denote as $N_{\\text{budget}}$:\n$$N_{\\text{budget}} = \\beta \\times M$$\nSubstituting the given values, $\\beta = 0.12$ and $M = 2.5 \\times 10^5$:\n$$N_{\\text{budget}} = 0.12 \\times (2.5 \\times 10^5) = 0.12 \\times 250000 = 30000$$\nThe memory budget allows for a maximum of $30000$ elements to be refined.\n\nThe refinement strategy is to select elements from the eligible set, starting with those having the highest values of $\\eta_K$, until the budget is exhausted. The number of elements to be refined, $N_{\\text{refine}}$, is therefore the minimum of the number of eligible elements and the number imposed by the budget constraint.\n$$N_{\\text{refine}} = \\min(N_{\\text{eligible}}, N_{\\text{budget}})$$\n$$N_{\\text{refine}} = \\min(75000, 30000)$$\n$$N_{\\text{refine}} = 30000$$\n\nThus, in one cycle, $30000$ elements will be marked for refinement. These would be the $30000$ elements from the high-gradient population with the largest error indicators $\\eta_K$.",

We can proceed with the solution.\n\n### Task 1: Determine Minimum Refinement Parameters\n**Strategy $\\mathrm{(p)}$: Minimum polynomial degree $p$**\nWe must find the minimum integer $p$ such that $e_{p}(p) \\leq e_{\\mathrm{tol}}$.\n$$ \\alpha\\,\\exp(-\\beta p) \\leq e_{\\mathrm{tol}} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ (2.0 \\times 10^{-2}) \\exp(-0.9 p) \\leq 10^{-6} $$\n$$ \\exp(-0.9 p) \\leq \\frac{10^{-6}}{2.0 \\times 10^{-2}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5} $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ -0.9 p \\leq \\ln(5.0 \\times 10^{-5}) $$\n$$ p \\geq -\\frac{\\ln(5.0 \\times 10^{-5})}{0.9} $$\nUsing $\\ln(5.0 \\times 10^{-5}) \\approx -9.9034875$:\n$$ p \\geq -\\frac{-9.9034875}{0.9} \\approx 11.003875 $$\nSince $p$ must be an integer, the minimum required polynomial degree is $p_{\\min}=12$.\n\n**Strategy $\\mathrm{(h)}$: Minimum refinement level $L$**\nWe must find the minimum integer $L$ such that $e_{h}(h) \\leq e_{\\mathrm{tol}}$. The polynomial degree is fixed at $p_f=2$. The element size is $h = h_0 / 2^L$.\n$$ \\eta\\,h^{p_{f}+1} \\leq e_{\\mathrm{tol}} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ 5.0\\,h^{2+1} \\leq 10^{-6} $$\n$$ h^{3} \\leq \\frac{10^{-6}}{5.0} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-7} $$\n$$ h \\leq (2.0 \\times 10^{-7})^{1/3} \\approx 0.005848 \\; \\mathrm{m} $$\nNow, we relate this to the refinement level $L$:\n$$ \\frac{h_{0}}{2^{L}} \\leq 0.005848 $$\n$$ \\frac{0.0625}{2^{L}} \\leq 0.005848 $$\n$$ 2^{L} \\geq \\frac{0.0625}{0.005848} \\approx 10.6875 $$\nWe must find the smallest integer $L$ that satisfies this. For $L=3$, $2^3=8$, which is insufficient. For $L=4$, $2^4=16$, which is sufficient. Thus, the minimum required refinement level is $L_{\\min}=4$.\n\n### Task 2: Compute Performance Metrics\n**Strategy $\\mathrm{(p)}$ with $p=12$**\n- Parameters: $p=12$, $h=h_{0}=0.0625$, $N=N_{0}=256$.\n- Total DoF: $N_{\\mathrm{DoF}, p} = N\\,N_{e}(p) = N_{0}(p+1)^{2}m = 256(12+1)^{2}(4) = 1024(13)^{2} = 1024(169) = 173056$.\n- Number of time steps: $n_{t, p} = \\dfrac{a\\,T\\,(p+1)^{2}}{\\mathrm{CFL}\\,h} = \\dfrac{(1)(1)(12+1)^{2}}{(0.5)(0.0625)} = \\dfrac{169}{0.03125} = 5408$.\n- Total work: $W_{p} = N\\,n_{t, p}\\,c_{e}(p) = N_{0}\\,n_{t, p}\\,\\gamma(p+1)^{3} = 256(5408)(2.0 \\times 10^{5})(12+1)^{3} = 256(5408)(2.0 \\times 10^{5})(2197)$.\n$W_{p} = 6.083264512 \\times 10^{14}$ FLOPs.\n- Work per DoF: $w_{\\mathrm{DoF}, p} = W_{p} / N_{\\mathrm{DoF}, p} = \\dfrac{6.08326 \\times 10^{14}}{173056} \\approx 3.5152 \\times 10^{9}$ FLOPs/DoF.\n\n**Strategy $\\mathrm{(h)}$ with $L=4$**\n- Parameters: $p=p_{f}=2$, $L=4$.\n- Number of elements: $N = N_{0}\\,4^{L} = 256 \\cdot 4^4 = 256 \\cdot 256 = 65536$.\n- Element size: $h = h_{0}/2^{L} = 0.0625/2^4 = 0.0625/16 = 0.00390625$.\n- Total DoF: $N_{\\mathrm{DoF}, h} = N\\,N_{e}(p_{f}) = N(p_f+1)^{2}m = 65536(2+1)^{2}(4) = 65536(9)(4) = 2359296$.\n- Number of time steps: $n_{t, h} = \\dfrac{a\\,T\\,(p_f+1)^{2}}{\\mathrm{CFL}\\,h} = \\dfrac{(1)(1)(2+1)^{2}}{(0.5)(0.00390625)} = \\dfrac{9}{0.001953125} = 4608$.\n- Total work: $W_{h} = N\\,n_{t, h}\\,c_{e}(p_f) = N\\,n_{t, h}\\,\\gamma(p_f+1)^{3} = 65536(4608)(2.0 \\times 10^{5})(2+1)^{3} = 65536(4608)(2.0 \\times 10^{5})(27)$.\n$W_{h} = 1.6307453952 \\times 10^{15}$ FLOPs.\n- Work per DoF: $w_{\\mathrm{DoF}, h} = W_{h} / N_{\\mathrm{DoF}, h} = \\dfrac{1.63075 \\times 10^{15}}{2359296} \\approx 6.912 \\times 10^{8}$ FLOPs/DoF.\n\n### Task 3: Choose Minimal Cost Strategy\nTo find the most efficient strategy, we compare the total computational costs $W_{p}$ and $W_{h}$.\n$$ W_{p} \\approx 6.083 \\times 10^{14} \\text{ FLOPs} $$\n$$ W_{h} \\approx 1.631 \\times 10^{15} \\text{ FLOPs} $$\nSince $W_{p}  W_{h}$, the $p$-refinement strategy is computationally less expensive for achieving the desired accuracy for this smooth problem, which is consistent with high-order methods theory.\n\nThe minimal total cost is $W_{\\min} = W_{p} = 6.083264512 \\times 10^{14}$ FLOPs.\nThe problem requires expressing this cost in units of $10^9$ FLOPs (GFLOPs) and rounding to four significant figures.\n$$ \\text{Cost in GFLOPs} = \\frac{W_{\\min}}{10^9} = \\frac{6.083264512 \\times 10^{14}}{10^9} = 6.083264512 \\times 10^{5} $$\nThis value is $608326.4512$.
