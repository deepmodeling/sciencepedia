The fundamental principle governing this is the Geometric Conservation Law (GCL), which dictates that the rate of change of a cell's volume must equal the volume swept by its moving boundaries. This exercise grounds this abstract law in a concrete calculation, allowing you to derive the GCL from the Reynolds Transport Theorem and then verify it numerically for a deforming 2D cell, solidifying your understanding of this cornerstone of Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) methods.",

            "problem": "Consider a single planar triangular control volume (cell) in a two-dimensional unsteady mesh used in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The triangle has counterclockwise-ordered vertices with positions $\\boldsymbol{A}=(x_A,y_A)$, $\\boldsymbol{B}=(x_B,y_B)$, and $\\boldsymbol{C}=(x_C,y_C)$, and mesh-point velocities at these vertices given by $\\boldsymbol{w}_A=(u_A,v_A)$, $\\boldsymbol{w}_B=(u_B,v_B)$, and $\\boldsymbol{w}_C=(u_C,v_C)$. The mesh velocity along each straight edge is assumed to vary linearly with arc length between its endpoint vertex velocities. Let the outward unit normal along each edge be well-defined and constant over that straight edge.\n\nStarting from the Reynolds transport theorem and fundamental kinematics, derive the relationship between the instantaneous rate of change of the cell area and the outward-normal component of the mesh velocity integrated along the cell boundary. Use this to obtain an exact expression, under the linear edge-velocity assumption, for the area time derivative in terms of known geometric edge quantities and vertex velocities (an “edge sweep”).\n\nThen, for the specific triangle with vertex coordinates $\\boldsymbol{A}=(0,0)$, $\\boldsymbol{B}=(2,0)$, and $\\boldsymbol{C}=(0,3)$, and vertex velocities $\\boldsymbol{w}_A=(0.5,-0.2)$, $\\boldsymbol{w}_B=(0.1,0.3)$, and $\\boldsymbol{w}_C=(-0.4,0.0)$ (in meters per second), compute the instantaneous area time derivative in two ways: (i) by evaluating the boundary sweep integral exactly along each edge under the given linearity assumption, and (ii) by differentiating the oriented polygon area with respect to time using the vertex velocities. Confirm the equality of these two values to demonstrate the Geometric Conservation Law (GCL).\n\nProvide the final numerical value of the instantaneous rate of change of the cell area. Round your answer to four significant figures. Express the final rate in square meters per second.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and verification of the Geometric Conservation Law (GCL) for a deforming triangular cell in two dimensions. The GCL mandates that the rate of change of a control volume's geometric measure (area in 2D, volume in 3D) must be equal to the integrated flux of the boundary velocity. We will first derive this relationship from fundamental principles, then apply it to a specific numerical case.\n\nThe first step is to establish the general kinematic relationship between the rate of change of an area and the velocity of its boundary. This is a direct application of the Reynolds Transport Theorem for a moving control area $A(t)$ with a boundary $\\partial A(t)$. The theorem states that for a scalar field $f(\\boldsymbol{r}, t)$, the total time derivative of its integral over $A(t)$ is given by:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{A(t)} f \\, dA = \\int_{A(t)} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial t} \\, dA + \\oint_{\\partial A(t)} f (\\boldsymbol{w} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}) \\, ds $$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{w}$ is the velocity of the boundary, $\\boldsymbol{n}$ is the outward unit normal to the boundary, and $ds$ is the differential arc length along the boundary.\n\nTo find the rate of change of the area itself, we choose the scalar field to be unity, i.e., $f=1$. The integral of $f=1$ over the area $A(t)$ is simply the area $A$.\n$$ \\int_{A(t)} 1 \\cdot dA = A(t) $$\nTherefore, the left-hand side of the Reynolds Transport Theorem becomes $\\frac{d}{dt}A(t)$, or simply $\\frac{dA}{dt}$.\n\nOn the right-hand side, the first term involves the partial time derivative of $f=1$, which is zero:\n$$ \\int_{A(t)} \\frac{\\partial (1)}{\\partial t} \\, dA = \\int_{A(t)} 0 \\, dA = 0 $$\nThe second term, the boundary integral, becomes:\n$$ \\oint_{\\partial A(t)} 1 \\cdot (\\boldsymbol{w} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}) \\, ds = \\oint_{\\partial A(t)} (\\boldsymbol{w} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}) \\, ds $$\nEquating the left and right sides, we obtain the fundamental kinematic expression for the rate of change of area:\n$$ \\frac{dA}{dt} = \\oint_{\\partial A(t)} (\\boldsymbol{w} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}) \\, ds $$\nThis equation states that the rate of area change is the flux of the boundary velocity normal to the boundary, integrated over the entire boundary.\n\nNext, we evaluate this boundary integral for the given triangular cell with vertices $\\boldsymbol{A}$, $\\boldsymbol{B}$, and $\\boldsymbol{C}$. The boundary $\\partial A$ is composed of three straight edges: $\\boldsymbol{AB}$, $\\boldsymbol{BC}$, and $\\boldsymbol{CA}$. The integral is thus a sum of three line integrals:\n$$ \\frac{dA}{dt} = \\int_{AB} (\\boldsymbol{w} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}_{AB}) \\, ds + \\int_{BC} (\\boldsymbol{w} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}_{BC}) \\, ds + \\int_{CA} (\\boldsymbol{w} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n}_{CA}) \\, ds $$\nThe problem states that the mesh velocity $\\boldsymbol{w}$ varies linearly along each edge. Let's consider a generic edge from vertex $\\boldsymbol{P}_1$ to vertex $\\boldsymbol{P}_2$, with length $L$ and vertex velocities $\\boldsymbol{w}_1$ and $\\boldsymbol{w}_2$. The contribution from this edge to the rate of area change is:\n$$ \\int_0^L \\left[ \\boldsymbol{w}_1 \\left(1 - \\frac{s}{L}\\right) + \\boldsymbol{w}_2 \\left(\\frac{s}{L}\\right) \\right] \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} \\, ds = \\frac{L}{2} (\\boldsymbol{w}_1 + \\boldsymbol{w}_2) \\cdot \\boldsymbol{n} $$\nThis result is intuitive: the rate of area swept by an edge is its length multiplied by the average of the normal velocity components at its endpoints. The total rate of change of the cell's area is the sum of these \"edge sweep\" terms for all three edges.\n\nNow, we perform the two specified calculations for the given triangle.\nThe vertices are $\\boldsymbol{A}=(0,0)$, $\\boldsymbol{B}=(2,0)$, $\\boldsymbol{C}=(0,3)$.\nThe vertex velocities are $\\boldsymbol{w}_A=(0.5,-0.2)$, $\\boldsymbol{w}_B=(0.1,0.3)$, and $\\boldsymbol{w}_C=(-0.4,0.0)$, in units of m/s.\n\n(i) Calculation via the boundary sweep integral:\nWe need the geometric properties of each edge.\nEdge $\\boldsymbol{AB}$: Length $L_{AB} = 2$, unit normal $\\boldsymbol{n}_{AB}=(0,-1)$. Contribution: $2 \\cdot (\\frac{(0.5, -0.2) + (0.1, 0.3)}{2} \\cdot (0,-1)) = -0.1$.\nEdge $\\boldsymbol{BC}$: Length $L_{BC} = \\sqrt{13}$, unit normal $\\boldsymbol{n}_{BC}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{13}}(3,2)$. Contribution: $\\sqrt{13} \\cdot (\\frac{(0.1, 0.3) + (-0.4, 0.0)}{2} \\cdot \\frac{(3,2)}{\\sqrt{13}}) = -0.15$.\nEdge $\\boldsymbol{CA}$: Length $L_{CA} = 3$, unit normal $\\boldsymbol{n}_{CA}=(-1,0)$. Contribution: $3 \\cdot (\\frac{(-0.4, 0.0) + (0.5, -0.2)}{2} \\cdot (-1,0)) = -0.15$.\nTotal rate of area change:\n$$ \\frac{dA}{dt} = -0.1 - 0.15 - 0.15 = -0.4 \\, \\text{m}^2/\\text{s} $$\n\n(ii) Calculation by differentiating the area formula:\nThe area of a triangle with vertices $(x_A, y_A)$, $(x_B, y_B)$, and $(x_C, y_C)$ is $A = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ x_A(y_B - y_C) + x_B(y_C - y_A) + x_C(y_A - y_B) \\right]$. Differentiating with respect to time gives:\n$$ \\frac{dA}{dt} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ u_A(y_B - y_C) + u_B(y_C - y_A) + u_C(y_A - y_B) + v_A(x_C - x_B) + v_B(x_A - x_C) + v_C(x_B - x_A) \\right] $$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$\\boldsymbol{A}=(0,0)$, $\\boldsymbol{B}=(2,0)$, $\\boldsymbol{C}=(0,3)$.\n$\\boldsymbol{w}_A=(0.5,-0.2)$, $\\boldsymbol{w}_B=(0.1,0.3)$, $\\boldsymbol{w}_C=(-0.4,0.0)$.\n$$ \\frac{dA}{dt} = \\frac{1}{2} [ 0.5(0-3) + 0.1(3-0) + (-0.4)(0-0) + (-0.2)(0-2) + 0.3(0-0) + 0.0(2-0) ] $$\n$$ \\frac{dA}{dt} = \\frac{1}{2} [ -1.5 + 0.3 + 0.4 ] = \\frac{1}{2} [ -0.8 ] = -0.4 \\, \\text{m}^2/\\text{s} $$\n\nBoth calculation methods yield the same result, $\\frac{dA}{dt} = -0.4 \\, \\text{m}^2/\\text{s}$. This equality numerically verifies the Geometric Conservation Law. The instantaneous rate of change of the cell area is negative, indicating that the triangle is shrinking. Rounding to four significant figures, the result is $-0.4000$.",

For a given pattern, only one edge is displaced, while the other three remain fixed at their reference coordinates.\n\n3.  **Laplacian Smoothing:** The interior node positions are computed using a Jacobi-style iterative method. For a specified number of iterations, each interior node's position is updated to the arithmetic average of its four neighbors' positions from the previous iteration. This method is equivalent to an iterative solver for a linear spring system with uniform stiffness ($k_{ij}=1$).\n\n4.  **Linear Spring Analogy:** The equilibrium positions of the interior nodes are found by directly solving a system of linear equations, $\\mathbf{Kx} = \\mathbf{f}$. This system represents the force balance at each node, where forces are exerted by springs along the mesh edges.\n    *   The stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ and force vector $\\mathbf{f}$ are assembled based on the specified stiffness model ('uniform' or 'invlen') and the fixed positions of the boundary nodes.\n    *   The `invlen` stiffness for an edge is the reciprocal of its length in the *reference* grid.\n    *   The linear system is solved independently for the x and y coordinates using a sparse direct solver.\n\n5.  **Quality Metrics:** For both resulting meshes (from Laplacian smoothing and the spring analogy), the following quality metrics are computed:\n    *   **Internal Angles:** The four internal angles of each quadrilateral cell are calculated. The mean and standard deviation of all angles across the mesh are then determined.\n    *   **Aspect Ratio:** For each cell, the ratio of the longest edge to the shortest edge is computed.

Given enough iterations, the results should be nearly identical. The difference in metrics is expected to be zero (or within numerical precision).\n*   **Inverse-Length Stiffness on a Square Grid (Case 2):** On a square reference grid ($N_x=N_y$), all reference edge lengths are identical. Therefore, the inverse-length stiffness model results in a uniform stiffness value for all springs. This case becomes equivalent to the uniform stiffness case, and the difference in metrics is expected to be zero.\n*   **Inverse-Length Stiffness on a Rectangular Grid (Case 3):** On a non-square reference grid ($N_x \\neq N_y$), horizontal and vertical edges have different lengths, leading to two different stiffness values. The spring analogy solves a weighted (anisotropic) Laplacian system, while the implemented smoother solves an unweighted (isotropic) one. The resulting node positions and, consequently, the mesh quality metrics are expected to be different.
