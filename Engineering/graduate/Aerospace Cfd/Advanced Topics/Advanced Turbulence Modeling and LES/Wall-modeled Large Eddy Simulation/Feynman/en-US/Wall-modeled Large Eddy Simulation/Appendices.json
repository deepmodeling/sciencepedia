It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and all its components are standard within the field of fluid dynamics. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Analysis\n\nThe primary task is to derive an expression for the scale separation ratio, $S$, and analyze its implications.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Scale Separation Ratio, $S$**\nThe scale separation ratio $S$ is defined as the ratio of the LES filter width $\\Delta$ to the viscous length scale $\\ell_{\\nu}$:\n$$\nS = \\frac{\\Delta}{\\ell_{\\nu}}\n$$\nWe are given expressions for both $\\Delta$ and $\\ell_{\\nu}$.\nThe filter width is proportional to the channel half-height $\\delta$:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\alpha\\,\\delta\n$$\nThe viscous length scale, or wall unit, is defined as:\n$$\n\\ell_{\\nu} = \\frac{\\nu}{u_{\\tau}}\n$$\nSubstituting these two expressions into the definition of $S$:\n$$\nS = \\frac{\\alpha\\,\\delta}{\\left(\\frac{\\nu}{u_{\\tau}}\\right)}\n$$\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n$$\nS = \\alpha \\left(\\frac{u_{\\tau}\\,\\delta}{\\nu}\\right)\n$$\nWe recognize the term in the parentheses as the definition of the friction Reynolds number, $Re_{\\tau}$:\n$$\nRe_{\\tau} = \\frac{u_{\\tau}\\,\\delta}{\\nu}\n$$\nTherefore, the expression for the scale separation ratio $S$ in terms of $\\alpha$ and $Re_{\\tau}$ is:\n$$\nS = \\alpha\\,Re_{\\tau}\n$$\n\n**2. Evaluation of $S$**\nNext, we evaluate $S$ for the given values of $\\alpha = 0.05$ and $Re_{\\tau} = 10^{5}$.\nSubstituting these values into our derived expression:\n$$\nS = (0.05) \\times (10^{5}) = 0.05 \\times 100000 = 5000\n$$\nThe problem requests the result to be rounded to three significant figures. The value $5000$ can be expressed in scientific notation as $5.00 \\times 10^3$ to explicitly indicate three significant figures.\n\n**3. Physical Interpretation and Justification of Wall-Modeling**\nThe calculated value of $S = 5000$ has a profound physical meaning in the context of turbulence simulation. The ratio $S$ is equivalent to the LES filter width expressed in wall units, commonly denoted as $\\Delta^{+}$. That is, $\\Delta^{+} = \\frac{\\Delta}{\\ell_{\\nu}} = S = 5000$. This value must be compared to the characteristic length scales of the dynamically important structures in the near-wall region of a turbulent flow, also expressed in wall units.\n\nThe canonical scales of the near-wall region are:\n- **Viscous Sublayer:** Occupies the region $y^{+} \\lesssim 5$, where $y^{+}$ is the wall-normal coordinate in wall units. The thickness is of order $\\mathcal{O}(1)$.\n- **Buffer Layer:** Occupies approximately $5 \\lesssim y^{+} \\lesssim 30$. This region is characterized by the peak production of turbulent kinetic energy. Its thickness is of order $\\mathcal{O}(10)$.\n- **Near-Wall Streaks:** These are quasi-streamwise, elongated regions of low- and high-speed fluid that are the dominant coherent structures in the inner layer. Their characteristic mean spanwise spacing is approximately $\\lambda_z^{+} \\approx 100$. These structures are responsible for the majority of turbulence production.\n\nOur calculated filter width is $\\Delta^{+} = 5000$. Comparing this to the physical scales:\n- $\\Delta^{+} = 5000 \\gg 5$: The filter is thousands of times larger than the viscous sublayer thickness.\n- $\\Delta^{+} = 5000 \\gg 30$: The filter is over a hundred times larger than the buffer layer thickness.\n- $\\Delta^{+} = 5000 \\gg 100$: The filter is fifty times larger than the characteristic spacing of the near-wall streaks.\n\nThis comparison demonstrates a vast separation of scales. The LES grid, characterized by its filter width $\\Delta$, is orders of magnitude too coarse to resolve any of the fundamental structures of the near-wall turbulence. The entire inner layer, including the sublayer, buffer layer, and the energy-containing streaks, lies deep within the unresolved, subgrid-scale (SGS) part of the simulation.\n\nThis finding directly justifies the use of a wall model. A \"wall-resolved\" LES would require a grid fine enough to capture these scales, typically needing $\\Delta^{+}$ to be of order $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ in the wall-normal direction and $\\mathcal{O}(10)$ in the wall-parallel directions. At $Re_{\\tau} = 10^{5}$, this would be computationally prohibitive. The WMLES approach acknowledges this limitation by intentionally using a coarse grid near the wall ($\\Delta^{+} \\gg 100$) and replacing the computationally expensive, direct resolution of the inner layer with a \"wall model\". This model uses theoretical or empirical laws (like the law-of-the-wall) to compute the wall shear stress based on the state of the flow at the first off-wall grid point, thereby providing the correct boundary condition for the outer-layer LES. The large value of $S=5000$ confirms that the simulation is operating firmly in the WMLES regime where such a model is not just an option but a necessity.",

            "solution": "The problem requires determining the dimensionless log-law intercept, $B^{+}$, that ensures consistency between a wall model and a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of a fully developed turbulent plane channel flow. The consistency is enforced by satisfying the mean momentum balance.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the wall shear stress, $\\tau_w$, and the total shear stress at an arbitrary wall-normal location, $y$. For a steady, fully developed, incompressible plane channel flow, the mean momentum equation in the streamwise direction simplifies to a balance between the mean pressure gradient and the gradient of the total shear stress, $\\tau_{total}(y)$.\n$$\n\\frac{d\\tau_{total}}{dy} = \\frac{d P}{dx}\n$$\nwhere $\\frac{d P}{dx}$ is the constant mean pressure gradient driving the flow. Integrating this equation from the wall ($y=0$) to a location $y$ gives:\n$$\n\\tau_{total}(y) - \\tau_{total}(0) = y \\frac{d P}{dx}\n$$\nAt the wall, the total shear stress is the wall shear stress, $\\tau_{total}(0) = \\tau_w$. At the channel centerline, $y=h$, the shear stress must be zero due to symmetry, $\\tau_{total}(h) = 0$. Applying this condition to the integrated equation for $y=h$:\n$$\n0 - \\tau_w = h \\frac{d P}{dx} \\implies \\frac{d P}{dx} = -\\frac{\\tau_w}{h}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for the pressure gradient back into the equation for $\\tau_{total}(y)$ yields the linear shear stress distribution:\n$$\n\\tau_{total}(y) = \\tau_w - y \\frac{\\tau_w}{h} = \\tau_w \\left(1 - \\frac{y}{h}\\right)\n$$\nThis equation represents the fundamental equilibrium momentum balance that must be satisfied across the channel.

The law is:\n$$\nU_{v}^{+}(y_{s}) = \\frac{1}{\\kappa} \\ln(y_{s}^{+}) + B\n$$\nWe use the given assumption that the term $\\sqrt{\\rho/\\rho_{w}}$ is constant across the integration path and equal to its value at $y_{s}$, which is $\\sqrt{\\rho_{s}/\\rho_{w}}$. Applying this approximation to the integral definition of $U_{v}^{+}$:\n$$\nU_{v}^{+}(y_{s}) = \\int_{0}^{U_{s}^{+}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho(U'^{+})}{\\rho_{w}}} dU'^{+} \\approx \\int_{0}^{U_{s}^{+}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho_{s}}{\\rho_{w}}} dU'^{+} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho_{s}}{\\rho_{w}}} [U'^{+}]_{0}^{U_{s}^{+}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho_{s}}{\\rho_{w}}} U_{s}^{+}\n$$\nSubstituting $U_{s}^{+} = \\tilde{U}(y_{s})/u_{\\tau}$ and $y_{s}^{+} = y_{s} u_{\\tau} / \\nu_{w}$, the log-law equation becomes:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho_{s}}{\\rho_{w}}} \\frac{\\tilde{U}(y_{s})}{u_{\\tau}} = \\frac{1}{\\kappa} \\ln\\left(\\frac{y_{s} u_{\\tau}}{\\nu_{w}}\\right) + B\n$$\nThis is a nonlinear equation for the unknown friction velocity $u_{\\tau}$. We first compute the constants $\\rho_{w}$ and $\\nu_{w}$ from the given data:\n- Pressure: $p_{w} \\approx p_{e} = 5.0 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\text{Pa}$\n- Wall temperature: $T_{w} = 300\\ \\text{K}$\n- Gas constant for air: $R = 287\\ \\text{J/(kg·K)}$\n- Wall dynamic viscosity: $\\mu_{w} = 1.84 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{Pa·s}$\n\nThe wall density $\\rho_{w}$ is calculated from the ideal gas law $p_{w} = \\rho_{w} R T_{w}$:\n$$\n\\rho_{w} = \\frac{p_{w}}{R T_{w}} = \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{4}}{287 \\times 300} \\approx 0.58072\\ \\text{kg/m}^3\n$$\nThe wall kinematic viscosity $\\nu_{w}$ is:\n$$\n\\nu_{w} = \\frac{\\mu_{w}}{\\rho_{w}} = \\frac{1.84 \\times 10^{-5}}{0.58072} \\approx 3.1688 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{m}^2/s\n$$\nNow, we substitute all known values into the nonlinear equation for $u_{\\tau}$:\n- $\\kappa = 0.41$, $B = 5.2$\n- $y_{s} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{m}$\n- $\\tilde{U}(y_{s}) = 310\\ \\text{m/s}$\n- $\\rho_{s} = 0.45\\ \\text{kg/m}^3$\n\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\frac{0.45}{0.58072}} \\frac{310}{u_{\\tau}} = \\frac{1}{0.41} \\ln\\left(\\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\times u_{\\tau}}{3.1688 \\times 10^{-5}}\\right) + 5.2\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{272.89}{u_{\\tau}} \\approx 2.439 \\ln(157.79 u_{\\tau}) + 5.2\n$$\nThis transcendental equation can be solved numerically for $u_{\\tau}$. A fixed-point iteration of the form $u_{\\tau}^{(k+1)} = G(u_{\\tau}^{(k)})$ is suitable:\n$$\nu_{\\tau}^{(k+1)} = \\frac{272.89}{2.439 \\ln(157.79 u_{\\tau}^{(k)}) + 5.2}\n$$\nStarting with an initial guess of $u_{\\tau}^{(0)} = 10\\ \\text{m/s}$, the iteration converges rapidly:\n$u_{\\tau}^{(1)} \\approx 11.78\\ \\text{m/s}$\n$u_{\\tau}^{(2)} \\approx 11.58\\ \\text{m/s}$\n$u_{\\tau}^{(3)} \\approx 11.60\\ \\text{m/s}$\n$u_{\\tau}^{(4)} \\approx 11.60\\ \\text{m/s}$\nThe converged value is $u_{\\tau} \\approx 11.601\\ \\text{m/s}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the wall shear stress $\\tau_{w}$ using its definition:\n$$\n\\tau_{w} = \\rho_{w} u_{\\tau}^{2} = (0.58072) \\times (11.601)^{2} \\approx 78.147\\ \\text{Pa}\n$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get:\n$$\n\\tau_{w} \\approx 78.1\\ \\text{Pa}\n$$",
