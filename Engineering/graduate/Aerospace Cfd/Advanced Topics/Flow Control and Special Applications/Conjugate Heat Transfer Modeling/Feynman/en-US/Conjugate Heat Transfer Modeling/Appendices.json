            "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional, steady conjugate heat transfer problem representative of external aerothermal heating modeled within Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). A flat, homogeneous heat-shield tile of thickness $L$ and thermal conductivity $k$ is cooled from its inner face and exposed to a high-enthalpy external flow on its outer face. The $x$-coordinate is defined normal to the tile, with $x=0$ at the cooled inner face and $x=L$ at the outer face where the solid meets the fluid. The inner face is maintained at a uniform temperature $T_{b}$ by an internal cooling system. The external flow is characterized by a uniform heat transfer coefficient $h$ relative to the outer surface and a free-stream temperature $T_{\\infty}$. Assume the material properties are constant, the conduction is strictly one-dimensional, there is no internal volumetric heat generation, and radiative exchange and contact resistances are negligible. The flow-side heat transfer is well represented by Newton’s law of cooling at the wall.\n\nStarting from Fourier’s law of heat conduction and Newton’s law of cooling, and enforcing energy conservation at the solid–fluid interface, derive an analytical expression for the interfacial temperature $T_{s}$ at $x=L$ and then evaluate it for the following parameters: $L = 3.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{m}$, $k = 22\\ \\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$, $T_{b} = 900\\ \\text{K}$, $h = 1.8 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-2}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$, and $T_{\\infty} = 1600\\ \\text{K}$.

The context of conjugate heat transfer for an aerospace application is physically realistic and a standard topic in engineering.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a second-order ordinary differential equation (from Fourier's law in steady-state) and two boundary conditions (a Dirichlet condition at $x=0$ and a Robin condition at $x=L$). This setup is sufficient for a unique and stable solution. All necessary parameters are provided.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, quantitative language, free of subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe governing equation for one-dimensional, steady-state heat conduction in a homogeneous material with constant thermal conductivity $k$ and no internal heat generation is derived from Fourier's law. In its differential form, the heat equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( k \\frac{dT}{dx} \\right) = 0 $$\nSince $k$ is constant, this further simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{d^2T}{dx^2} = 0 $$\nIntegrating this equation twice with respect to $x$ yields the general solution for the temperature profile $T(x)$:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dx} = C_1 $$\n$$ T(x) = C_1 x + C_2 $$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants of integration determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nThe first boundary condition is at the inner face, $x=0$, where the temperature is maintained at a constant value $T_b$:\n$$ T(0) = T_b $$\nApplying this to the general solution:\n$$ T(0) = C_1(0) + C_2 = T_b \\implies C_2 = T_b $$\nThus, the temperature profile is given by:\n$$ T(x) = C_1 x + T_b $$\n\nThe second boundary condition is at the solid–fluid interface, $x=L$. Here, the principle of energy conservation requires that the heat flux conducted to the surface from within the solid must equal the heat flux convected from the surface into the fluid.\n\nThe conductive heat flux, $q''_{cond}$, at $x=L$ is given by Fourier's law:\n$$ q''_{cond} = -k \\left. \\frac{dT}{dx} \\right|_{x=L} $$\nFrom our temperature profile, $\\frac{dT}{dx} = C_1$, so the conductive flux is constant throughout the solid:\n$$ q''_{cond} = -k C_1 $$\nThe convective heat flux, $q''_{conv}$, from the surface at temperature $T_s = T(L)$ to the fluid at temperature $T_{\\infty}$ is given by Newton's law of cooling:\n$$ q''_{conv} = h (T_s - T_{\\infty}) $$\nEquating the fluxes at the interface ($q''_{cond} = q''_{conv}$):\n$$ -k C_1 = h (T_s - T_{\\infty}) $$\nWe have two unknowns, $C_1$ and $T_s$. We can relate them using the temperature profile equation at $x=L$:\n$$ T_s = T(L) = C_1 L + T_b $$\nFrom this, we express $C_1$ in terms of $T_s$:\n$$ C_1 = \\frac{T_s - T_b}{L} $$\nNow, substitute this expression for $C_1$ into the energy balance equation:\n$$ -k \\left( \\frac{T_s - T_b}{L} \\right) = h (T_s - T_{\\infty}) $$\nWe now solve this algebraic equation for $T_s$.\n$$ -\\frac{k}{L} (T_s - T_b) = h T_s - h T_{\\infty} $$\n$$ -\\frac{k}{L} T_s + \\frac{k}{L} T_b = h T_s - h T_{\\infty} $$\nGroup the terms containing $T_s$ on one side and the constant terms on the other:\n$$ \\frac{k}{L} T_b + h T_{\\infty} = h T_s + \\frac{k}{L} T_s $$\n$$ \\frac{k}{L} T_b + h T_{\\infty} = T_s \\left( h + \\frac{k}{L} \\right) $$\nIsolating $T_s$ gives the analytical expression for the interfacial temperature:\n$$ T_s = \\frac{\\frac{k}{L} T_b + h T_{\\infty}}{h + \\frac{k}{L}} $$\nTo simplify the expression, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $L$:\n$$ T_s = \\frac{L \\left( \\frac{k}{L} T_b + h T_{\\infty} \\right)}{L \\left( h + \\frac{k}{L} \\right)} = \\frac{k T_b + h L T_{\\infty}}{h L + k} $$\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression using the given numerical values:\n$L = 3.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{m}$\n$k = 22\\ \\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$\n$T_{b} = 900\\ \\text{K}$\n$h = 1.8 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-2}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$\n$T_{\\infty} = 1600\\ \\text{K}$\n\nFirst, calculate the composite term $hL$:\n$$ hL = (1.8 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-2}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}) \\times (3.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\text{m}) = 5.4\\ \\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1} $$\nNow substitute all values into the expression for $T_s$:\n$$ T_s = \\frac{(22\\ \\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1})(900\\ \\text{K}) + (5.4\\ \\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1})(1600\\ \\text{K})}{5.4\\ \\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1} + 22\\ \\text{W}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}} $$\n$$ T_s = \\frac{19800 + 8640}{27.4}\\ \\text{K} $$\n$$ T_s = \\frac{28440}{27.4}\\ \\text{K} $$\n$$ T_s = 1037.9562043... \\ \\text{K} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

You must derive the governing expressions from first principles and implement them algorithmically. The flow is steady, statistically stationary, and two-layer: a semi-infinite fluid region above a finite-thickness solid substrate. The fluid is modeled by the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) energy equation in one dimension with eddy diffusivity closure, and the solid is modeled by one-dimensional Fourier conduction. Your program must compute, for each test case, the wall heat flux for two models: (i) a constant turbulent Prandtl number $Pr_t = \\text{const}$ and (ii) a variable $Pr_t(y)$ profile. Then it must report the pair of heat fluxes and their relative difference.\n\nStart from the following foundational statements that are to be used as the base for your derivation and algorithm design:\n- In the fluid, the Reynolds-averaged one-dimensional steady energy balance for a passive scalar temperature reduces to $$\\frac{d}{dy}\\left(k_\\text{eff}(y)\\,\\frac{dT}{dy}\\right)=0$$, where the effective conductivity is $$k_\\text{eff}(y)=k + \\rho\\,c_p\\,\\alpha_t(y)$$, $k$ is the molecular thermal conductivity, $\\rho$ is the density, $c_p$ is the specific heat at constant pressure, and $\\alpha_t(y)$ is the turbulent thermal diffusivity. The turbulent thermal diffusivity is related to the eddy viscosity $\\nu_t(y)$ and turbulent Prandtl number $Pr_t(y)$ by $$\\alpha_t(y)=\\frac{\\nu_t(y)}{Pr_t(y)}$$.\n- The eddy viscosity is modeled using the van Driest–damped mixing-length model, $$\\nu_t(y)=\\kappa\\,u_\\tau\\,y\\left[1-\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{y^+}{A^+}\\right)\\right]^2$$, where $\\kappa$ is the von Kármán constant, $u_\\tau$ is the friction velocity, $A^+$ is a constant, and $y^+=y\\,u_\\tau/\\nu$ is the wall coordinate defined using the kinematic viscosity $\\nu$.\n- In the solid, steady one-dimensional Fourier conduction applies, with temperature $T_s(y)$ satisfying $$\\frac{d^2 T_s}{dy^2}=0$$.\n- At the fluid–solid interface at $y=0$, temperature continuity and heat flux continuity hold: $$T(0)=T_s(0)=T_w,\\quad -k_\\text{eff}(0)\\left.\\frac{dT}{dy}\\right|_{0^+}=-k_s\\left.\\frac{dT_s}{dy}\\right|_{0^-}=q''$$. The wall heat flux $q''$ is taken as positive when flowing from the solid into the fluid.\n- Boundary conditions are: $T(y=\\delta)=T_\\infty$ in the fluid, and $T_s(y=-L_s)=T_\\text{base}$ in the solid, with $\\delta$ the outer edge of the thermal boundary layer used as truncation, $L_s$ the solid thickness, $T_\\infty$ the ambient fluid temperature, and $T_\\text{base}$ the base temperature at the back of the solid.\n\nYou must not introduce any other closure or correlation beyond what is defined here.

            "solution": "The physical problem describes a steady-state, one-dimensional conjugate heat transfer scenario. Heat is conducted through a solid substrate of finite thickness and then transferred into a semi-infinite fluid domain governed by turbulent convection. The objective is to determine the wall heat flux, $q''$, by establishing a consistent coupling between the solid and fluid domains. This is achieved by deriving the thermal resistance for each domain and combining them in a thermal circuit analogy.\n\nFirst, we analyze the solid domain, which spans the region $y \\in [-L_s, 0]$. The governing equation is the steady, one-dimensional heat conduction equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 T_s}{dy^2} = 0\n$$\nwhere $T_s(y)$ is the temperature profile within the solid. Integrating this equation twice with respect to $y$ gives a linear temperature profile:\n$$\nT_s(y) = C_1 y + C_2\n$$\nThe constants of integration, $C_1$ and $C_2$, are determined from the boundary conditions. At the solid-fluid interface, $y=0$, the temperature is the unknown wall temperature, $T_w$, so $T_s(0) = T_w$, which yields $C_2 = T_w$. At the back of the solid, $y=-L_s$, the temperature is held at a constant value $T_\\text{base}$, so $T_s(-L_s) = T_\\text{base}$. Substituting this into the solution gives:\n$$\nT_\\text{base} = C_1(-L_s) + T_w \\implies C_1 = \\frac{T_\\text{base} - T_w}{-L_s} = \\frac{T_w - T_\\text{base}}{L_s}\n$$\nThe heat flux, $q''$, is defined as positive when flowing from the solid into the fluid. This corresponds to the heat conducted to the interface at $y=0$. According to Fourier's law and the problem's sign convention, this flux is:\n$$\nq'' = -k_s \\left.\\frac{dT_s}{dy}\\right|_{y=0^-} = -k_s C_1 = -k_s \\left(\\frac{T_w - T_\\text{base}}{L_s}\\right) = k_s \\frac{T_\\text{base} - T_w}{L_s}\n$$\nwhere $k_s$ is the thermal conductivity of the solid. This equation can be rearranged to express the temperature drop across the solid in terms of its thermal resistance, $R_s$:\n$$\nT_\\text{base} - T_w = q'' \\frac{L_s}{k_s} \\equiv q'' R_s\n$$\nThus, the thermal resistance of the solid is $R_s = L_s/k_s$.\n\nNext, we analyze the fluid domain, which covers the region $y \\in [0, \\delta]$. The governing equation is the one-dimensional steady Reynolds-averaged energy equation with an eddy diffusivity closure:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dy}\\left(k_\\text{eff}(y)\\,\\frac{dT}{dy}\\right)=0\n$$\nwhere $T(y)$ is the mean temperature profile in the fluid and $k_\\text{eff}(y)$ is the effective thermal conductivity. This equation implies that the heat flux in the $y$-direction, $q_f(y) = -k_\\text{eff}(y) \\frac{dT}{dy}$, is constant for all $y \\in [0, \\delta]$. By the continuity of heat flux at the interface, this constant flux must be equal to $q''$. Therefore:\n$$\n-k_\\text{eff}(y)\\frac{dT}{dy} = q''\n$$\nWe can separate variables and integrate from the wall ($y=0$) to the edge of the thermal boundary layer ($y=\\delta$) to find the temperature drop across the fluid:\n$$\n\\int_{T(0)}^{T(\\delta)} dT = \\int_0^\\delta -\\frac{q''}{k_\\text{eff}(y)} dy\n$$\nUsing the boundary conditions $T(0)=T_w$ and $T(\\delta)=T_\\infty$:\n$$\nT_\\infty - T_w = -q'' \\int_0^\\delta \\frac{dy}{k_\\text{eff}(y)}\n$$\nThis can be rearranged in terms of a fluid thermal resistance, $R_f$:\n$$\nT_w - T_\\infty = q'' \\int_0^\\delta \\frac{dy}{k_\\text{eff}(y)} \\equiv q'' R_f\n$$\nThe fluid thermal resistance, $R_f$, is an integral that must be evaluated numerically:\n$$\nR_f = \\int_0^\\delta \\frac{dy}{k_\\text{eff}(y)}\n$$\nThe problem is reduced to finding the unknown wall heat flux $q''$ and wall temperature $T_w$ from the system of two linear equations:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nT_\\text{base} - T_w = q'' R_s \\\\\nT_w - T_\\infty = q'' R_f\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nAdding these two equations eliminates $T_w$ and provides a direct expression for $q''$:\n$$\n(T_\\text{base} - T_w) + (T_w - T_\\infty) = q''(R_s + R_f) \\implies T_\\text{base} - T_\\infty = q''(R_s + R_f)\n$$\nSolving for $q''$, we obtain the central formula for our computation:\n$$\nq'' = \\frac{T_\\text{base} - T_\\infty}{R_s + R_f} = \\frac{T_\\text{base} - T_\\infty}{\\frac{L_s}{k_s} + \\int_0^\\delta \\frac{dy}{k_\\text{eff}(y)}}\n$$\nThe effective thermal conductivity $k_\\text{eff}(y)$ is the sum of molecular and turbulent contributions: $k_\\text{eff}(y) = k + \\rho c_p \\alpha_t(y)$, where $\\alpha_t(y) = \\nu_t(y)/Pr_t(y)$. The eddy viscosity $\\nu_t(y)$ is given by the van Driest-damped mixing-length model:\n$$\n\\nu_t(y)=\\kappa\\,u_\\tau\\,y\\left[1-\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{y^+}{A^+}\\right)\\right]^2\n$$\nwith $y^+=y\\,u_\\tau/\\nu$, $\\kappa=0.41$, and $A^+=26$.\n\nThe problem requires a comparison between two models for the turbulent Prandtl number, $Pr_t$.\n1.  **Constant $Pr_t$ model:** $Pr_t(y) = \\hat{P}$. The effective conductivity is $k_{\\text{eff,const}}(y) = k + \\rho c_p \\nu_t(y)/\\hat{P}$. The resulting heat flux is denoted $q''_\\text{const}$.\n2.  **Variable $Pr_t$ model:** $Pr_t$ is a function of the wall coordinate $y^+$, given by $Pr_t(y^+) = P_\\text{log} - (P_\\text{log} - P_\\text{wall})\\exp(-y^+/B)$. The effective conductivity is $k_{\\text{eff,var}}(y) = k + \\rho c_p \\nu_t(y)/Pr_t(y^+(y))$. The resulting heat flux is denoted $q''_\\text{var}$.\n\nThe algorithmic procedure to solve the problem for each test case is as follows:\nFirst, for the constant $Pr_t$ model, the fluid thermal resistance $R_{f,\\text{const}}$ is computed by numerically integrating $\\int_0^\\delta (k_{\\text{eff,const}}(y))^{-1} dy$. Then, the heat flux $q''_\\text{const}$ is calculated using the overall heat flux formula.\nSecond, the same procedure is repeated for the variable $Pr_t$ model to find $R_{f,\\text{var}}$ and $q''_\\text{var}$.\nFinally, the relative difference is computed as $r = (q''_\\text{var} - q''_\\text{const}) / q''_\\text{const}$.\nThis procedure is implemented for each set of parameters provided in the test suite.

            "problem": "A two-dimensional, steady conjugate heat transfer problem couples an incompressible fluid layer to a homogeneous solid wall of thickness $L_{s}$ through an isothermal far-field fluid boundary and a fixed temperature at the solid back face. A second-order, cell-centered finite volume Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solver enforces continuity of temperature and normal heat flux at the fluid–solid interface. Three successively refined, conformal meshes are generated in which both the fluid and the solid grids are refined by a constant refinement ratio $r$, such that the representative interfacial grid spacings satisfy $h_{1}/h_{2}=h_{2}/h_{3}=r$. Let $q(h)$ denote the interfacial wall heat flux evaluated on the solid side and spatially averaged along the interface. Assume the numerical method is consistent and that, in the asymptotic grid-convergent regime, the leading truncation error of $q(h)$ admits the expansion $q(h)=q^{\\ast}+C h^{p}+\\mathcal{O}(h^{p+1})$, where $q^{\\ast}$ is the grid-converged interfacial heat flux, $C$ is a grid-independent constant for a fixed solution branch, and $p$ is the observed order of accuracy.\n\nOn the three meshes with $r=2$, the solver reports the following interface heat fluxes:\n$q(h_{1}) = 29\\,432\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$, $q(h_{2}) = 27\\,932\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$, and $q(h_{3}) = 27\\,557\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$.\n\nStarting from the truncation-error model stated above and using only the assumptions of consistency and constant refinement ratio, derive expressions to (i) identify the observed order $p$ from the three mesh solutions and (ii) obtain a Richardson-extrapolated estimate of $q^{\\ast}$ in terms of the three computed values and $r$. Then evaluate these expressions with the provided data to produce a single best estimate of the grid-converged interfacial wall heat flux. Express the final wall heat flux in $\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$ and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated and found to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of computational fluid dynamics and numerical analysis, specifically pertaining to grid convergence studies using Richardson extrapolation. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution.\n\nThe problem is concerned with estimating the grid-converged value of the spatially averaged interfacial heat flux, $q^{\\ast}$, from a series of three numerical solutions on successively refined grids. The relationship between the computed heat flux on a grid with characteristic spacing $h$, denoted $q(h)$, and the exact solution $q^{\\ast}$ is given by the truncation error expansion:\n$$q(h) = q^{\\ast} + C h^{p} + \\mathcal{O}(h^{p+1})$$\nwhere $p$ is the observed order of accuracy and $C$ is a constant. We are given three solutions, $q_1 = q(h_1)$, $q_2 = q(h_2)$, and $q_3 = q(h_3)$, on three grids with representative spacings $h_1 > h_2 > h_3$. The grids are refined by a constant ratio $r$, such that $h_1 = r h_2$ and $h_2 = r h_3$.\n\nAssuming we are in the asymptotic regime where the higher-order terms $\\mathcal{O}(h^{p+1})$ are negligible, we can write the following system of equations:\n$q_1 \\approx q^{\\ast} + C h_1^p$\n$q_2 \\approx q^{\\ast} + C h_2^p$\n$q_3 \\approx q^{\\ast} + C h_3^p$\n\n(i) Derivation of the expression for the observed order of accuracy, $p$.\n\nWe form the differences between successive solutions:\n$$q_1 - q_2 = (q^{\\ast} + C h_1^p) - (q^{\\ast} + C h_2^p) = C(h_1^p - h_2^p)$$\n$$q_2 - q_3 = (q^{\\ast} + C h_2^p) - (q^{\\ast} + C h_3^p) = C(h_2^p - h_3^p)$$\nUsing the grid refinement relationships $h_1 = r h_2$ and $h_2 = r h_3$, we can rewrite these differences:\n$$q_1 - q_2 = C((r h_2)^p - h_2^p) = C h_2^p (r^p - 1)$$\n$$q_2 - q_3 = C((r h_3)^p - h_3^p) = C h_3^p (r^p - 1)$$\nBy taking the ratio of these two differences, the unknown constant $C$ and the term $(r^p - 1)$ cancel out:\n$$\\frac{q_1 - q_2}{q_2 - q_3} = \\frac{C h_2^p (r^p - 1)}{C h_3^p (r^p - 1)} = \\frac{h_2^p}{h_3^p} = \\left(\\frac{h_2}{h_3}\\right)^p = r^p$$\nTo solve for $p$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{q_1 - q_2}{q_2 - q_3}\\right) = \\ln(r^p) = p \\ln(r)$$\nIsolating $p$ gives the expression for the observed order of accuracy:\n$$p = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{q_1 - q_2}{q_2 - q_3}\\right)}{\\ln(r)}$$\n\n(ii) Derivation of the Richardson-extrapolated estimate of $q^{\\ast}$.\n\nWe seek an expression for $q^{\\ast}$ in terms of the three computed values $q_1$, $q_2$, and $q_3$, and the refinement ratio $r$. Starting from the results above, we have two expressions for $r^p$:\n$$r^p = \\frac{q_1 - q_2}{q_2 - q_3}$$\nAlso, from the error model itself, we can write the ratios of the errors:\n$q_1 - q^{\\ast} = C h_1^p$\n$q_2 - q^{\\ast} = C h_2^p$\n$q_3 - q^{\\ast} = C h_3^p$\nThe ratio of the first two errors is $\\frac{q_1 - q^{\\ast}}{q_2 - q^{\\ast}} = \\frac{C h_1^p}{C h_2^p} = \\left(\\frac{h_1}{h_2}\\right)^p = r^p$.\nSimilarly, the ratio of the second two errors is $\\frac{q_2 - q^{\\ast}}{q_3 - q^{\\ast}} = \\frac{C h_2^p}{C h_3^p} = \\left(\\frac{h_2}{h_3}\\right)^p = r^p$.\nEquating these two expressions for $r^p$ yields:\n$$\\frac{q_1 - q^{\\ast}}{q_2 - q^{\\ast}} = \\frac{q_2 - q^{\\ast}}{q_3 - q^{\\ast}}$$\nCross-multiplying gives:\n$$(q_1 - q^{\\ast})(q_3 - q^{\\ast}) = (q_2 - q^{\\ast})^2$$\nExpanding both sides of the equation:\n$$q_1 q_3 - q_1 q^{\\ast} - q_3 q^{\\ast} + (q^{\\ast})^2 = q_2^2 - 2 q_2 q^{\\ast} + (q^{\\ast})^2$$\nThe $(q^{\\ast})^2$ terms cancel. We rearrange the equation to solve for $q^{\\ast}$:\n$$q_1 q_3 - q_2^2 = q_1 q^{\\ast} + q_3 q^{\\ast} - 2 q_2 q^{\\ast}$$\n$$q_1 q_3 - q_2^2 = q^{\\ast} (q_1 - 2q_2 + q_3)$$\nFinally, the Richardson-extrapolated estimate for the grid-converged heat flux is:\n$$q^{\\ast} = \\frac{q_1 q_3 - q_2^2}{q_1 - 2q_2 + q_3}$$\nThis expression, a form of Aitken's delta-squared process, provides the extrapolated value $q^{\\ast}$ directly from the three data points.\n\n(iii) Evaluation of the expressions.\n\nThe given data are:\n$q_1 = 29\\,432\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$\n$q_2 = 27\\,932\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$\n$q_3 = 27\\,557\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$\n$r = 2$\n\nFirst, we calculate the differences:\n$q_1 - q_2 = 29\\,432 - 27\\,932 = 1\\,500$\n$q_2 - q_3 = 27\\,932 - 27\\,557 = 375$\n\nNow, we compute the observed order of accuracy $p$:\n$$p = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{1\\,500}{375}\\right)}{\\ln(2)} = \\frac{\\ln(4)}{\\ln(2)} = \\frac{\\ln(2^2)}{\\ln(2)} = \\frac{2\\ln(2)}{\\ln(2)} = 2$$\nThe observed order of accuracy is exactly $2$, which is consistent with the problem statement that the solver is second-order.\n\nNext, we calculate the grid-converged heat flux $q^{\\ast}$. While the derived formula $q^{\\ast} = (q_1 q_3 - q_2^2)/(q_1 - 2q_2 + q_3)$ is correct, an algebraically equivalent and computationally more stable form is $q^{\\ast} = q_2 - \\frac{(q_1 - q_2)(q_2 - q_3)}{q_1 - 2q_2 + q_3}$. We use this form for the calculation. The denominator is $q_1 - 2q_2 + q_3 = (q_1 - q_2) - (q_2 - q_3) = 1\\,500 - 375 = 1\\,125$.\n$$q^{\\ast} = 27\\,932 - \\frac{1\\,500 \\times 375}{1\\,125} = 27\\,932 - \\frac{562\\,500}{1\\,125} = 27\\,932 - 500 = 27\\,432$$\nThe best estimate of the grid-converged interfacial wall heat flux is $27\\,432\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$.\n\nThe problem asks for this value to be rounded to four significant figures.\nThe value $27\\,432$ rounded to four significant figures is $27\\,430$. In scientific notation, this is $2.743 \\times 10^4$.",
