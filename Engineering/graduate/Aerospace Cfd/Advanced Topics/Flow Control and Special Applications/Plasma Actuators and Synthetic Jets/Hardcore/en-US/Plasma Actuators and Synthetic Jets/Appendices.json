            "problem": "Consider a surface Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) plasma actuator integrated near a synthetic jet orifice on a flat plate in air at $1\\,\\mathrm{atm}$ and $300\\,\\mathrm{K}$. The actuator comprises a buried electrode beneath a dielectric of thickness $0.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and an exposed electrode separated by a streamwise gap of $0.3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. The synthetic jet orifice diameter is $0.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and the local laminar boundary layer thickness at the operating Reynolds number is approximately $1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. Typical electron number densities in such atmospheric-pressure non-thermal discharges are in the range $n_e \\sim 10^{15}\\text{ to }10^{17}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, with electron temperature $T_e \\sim 1\\text{ to }5\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, while heavy species (ions and neutrals) remain near $300\\,\\mathrm{K}$.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been evaluated and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, providing all necessary information for a complete derivation and analysis.\n\nThe task is to derive the electron Debye length, calculate its value for the given plasma parameters, and compare it to the characteristic length scales of the actuator and flow. This comparison will allow us to assess the validity of the quasi-neutrality assumption in the context of plasma and flow modeling.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Electron Debye Length**\n\nWe begin with the first principles provided.\n1.  Poisson's equation relates the electrostatic potential $\\phi$ to the net space charge density $\\rho$:\n    $$ \\nabla^2 \\phi = -\\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0} $$\n    where $\\epsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space.\n\n2.  The net charge density $\\rho$ is the sum of charge densities of ions and electrons:\n    $$ \\rho = e n_i - e n_e = e(n_i - n_e) $$\n    where $e$ is the elementary charge, $n_i$ is the ion number density, and $n_e$ is the electron number density.\n\n3.  We consider a small perturbation from a uniform, quasi-neutral background state. In this background state, the ion and electron densities are equal, $n_{i0} \\approx n_{e0}$. We are told to assume that the ions are much heavier and their density is unperturbed on the short timescale of electron motion. Thus, we set the ion density equal to its background value: $n_i = n_{i0} \\approx n_{e0}$.\n\n4.  The electron density, $n_e$, responds to the local potential $\\phi$ according to the given linearized Boltzmann relation:\n    $$ n_e(\\phi) \\approx n_{e0}\\left(1 + \\frac{e\\phi}{k_B T_e}\\right) $$\n    where $n_{e0}$ is the background electron density, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T_e$ is the electron temperature. The term $k_B T_e$ represents the characteristic thermal energy of the electrons.\n\n5.  Substituting the expressions for $n_i$ and $n_e$ into the formula for $\\rho$:\n    $$ \\rho \\approx e\\left(n_{e0} - n_{e0}\\left(1 + \\frac{e\\phi}{k_B T_e}\\right)\\right) = e\\left(n_{e0} - n_{e0} - \\frac{n_{e0}e\\phi}{k_B T_e}\\right) = -\\frac{n_{e0}e^2\\phi}{k_B T_e} $$\n\n6.  Now, we substitute this expression for $\\rho$ back into Poisson's equation:\n    $$ \\nabla^2 \\phi = -\\frac{1}{\\epsilon_0}\\left(-\\frac{n_{e0}e^2\\phi}{k_B T_e}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{n_{e0}e^2}{\\epsilon_0 k_B T_e}\\right)\\phi $$\n\n7.  This equation is commonly known as the screened Poisson equation. It can be rewritten as:\n    $$ \\nabla^2 \\phi - \\frac{1}{\\lambda_D^2}\\phi = 0 $$\n    where $\\lambda_D$ is the characteristic screening length, known as the Debye length. By comparing the two forms, we can identify its definition:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{\\lambda_D^2} = \\frac{n_{e0}e^2}{\\epsilon_0 k_B T_e} $$\n    Solving for $\\lambda_D$, we get the formula for the electron Debye length:\n    $$ \\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon_0 k_B T_e}{n_{e0}e^2}} $$\nThis completes the derivation from the given first principles.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are asked to estimate the magnitude of $\\lambda_D$ for representative values.\nGiven:\n- Electron density, $n_e = n_{e0} = 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n- Electron temperature, $T_e = 2\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n- Permittivity of free space, $\\epsilon_0 = 8.854\\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}$\n- Elementary charge, $e = 1.602\\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n- Conversion factor, $1\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 1.602\\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J}$\n\nFirst, we convert the electron thermal energy $k_B T_e$ to Joules. The quantity $T_e$ given in electron-volts ($eV$) is a direct measure of energy.\n$$ k_B T_e = 2\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 2 \\times (1.602\\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J/eV}) = 3.204 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J} $$\nNow, we substitute all values into the derived formula for $\\lambda_D$:\n$$ \\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{(8.854\\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}) \\times (3.204 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{J})}{(10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}) \\times (1.602\\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C})^2}} $$\nLet's simplify the expression. Note that $3.204 \\times 10^{-19} = 2 \\times (1.602 \\times 10^{-19})$.\n$$ \\lambda_D^2 = \\frac{ (8.854\\times 10^{-12}) \\times (2 \\times 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}) }{ (10^{16}) \\times (1.602\\times 10^{-19})^2 } = \\frac{2 \\times (8.854\\times 10^{-12})}{10^{16} \\times (1.602\\times 10^{-19})} $$\n$$ \\lambda_D^2 = \\frac{1.7708\\times 10^{-11}}{1.602 \\times 10^{-3}}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2 \\approx 1.1054 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2 $$\n$$ \\lambda_D = \\sqrt{1.1054 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2} \\approx 1.051 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\nConverting to millimeters for comparison:\n$$ \\lambda_D \\approx 0.105\\,\\mathrm{mm} \\quad (\\text{or } 105\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}) $$\n\n**Part 3: Comparison and Physical Interpretation**\n\nThe Debye length, $\\lambda_D \\approx 0.105\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, is the fundamental length scale over which significant deviations from charge neutrality can occur. For regions with characteristic dimensions $L \\gg \\lambda_D$, the plasma is effectively quasi-neutral ($\\rho \\approx 0$). For regions where $L \\lesssim \\lambda_D$, such as sheaths near surfaces, charge separation is significant.\n\nLet's compare $\\lambda_D$ to the given geometric and flow length scales:\n- Actuator gap: $g = 0.3\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. ($\\lambda_D / g \\approx 0.35$)\n- Dielectric thickness: $d_{diel} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. ($\\lambda_D / d_{diel} \\approx 0.21$)\n- Jet orifice diameter: $d_{jet} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. ($\\lambda_D / d_{jet} \\approx 0.21$)\n- Boundary layer thickness: $\\delta \\approx 1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. ($\\lambda_D / \\delta \\approx 0.105$)\n- Forcing extent: $L_{force} = 5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. ($\\lambda_D / L_{force} \\approx 0.021$)\n\nIn all cases, the Debye length is smaller than the macroscopic scales of the system. This implies that the bulk of the plasma, filling the regions defined by these macroscopic scales, will be quasi-neutral. However, at the interface with any solid surface (the exposed electrode, the dielectric), a non-neutral plasma sheath will form. The thickness of this sheath is typically on the order of a few Debye lengths (e.g., $3\\lambda_D$ to $10\\lambda_D$). In our case, this corresponds to a sheath thickness on the order of several tenths of a millimeter. Within these sheaths, quasi-neutrality is violated.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. **Quasi-neutrality fails throughout the bulk discharge and near-wall flow because the electron Debye length is of the same order as the boundary layer thickness, so net space charge fills the actuator region.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The Debye length ($\\approx 0.1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) is not of the same order as the boundary layer thickness ($1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$); it is an order of magnitude smaller. Because the macroscopic scales are much larger than $\\lambda_D$, quasi-neutrality holds in the bulk of the discharge, it does not fail \"throughout\".\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nB. **Quasi-neutrality holds in the bulk of the discharge and the near-wall flow at scales from the gap to the boundary layer thickness, but it breaks down in thin sheaths adjacent to dielectric and electrode surfaces whose thickness is on the order of a few electron Debye lengths.**\nThis statement is entirely consistent with our derivation and analysis. The condition for quasi-neutrality ($L \\gg \\lambda_D$) is met for the bulk plasma region, defined by scales like the gap and boundary layer thickness. The breakdown of quasi-neutrality in sheaths with a thickness proportional to $\\lambda_D$ is the canonical description of plasma-surface interactions. This is the correct physical picture.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nC. **Quasi-neutrality can hold only if the electron Debye length is less than $1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$; for typical $n_e$ and $T_e$ in atmospheric DBDs it is larger than this, so quasi-neutrality is generally invalid.**\nThis statement sets an arbitrary and physically meaningless threshold of $1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. The criterion for quasi-neutrality is relative to the system's macroscopic dimensions ($L$), not an absolute value. Our calculated Debye length is $\\approx 105\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, which is much larger than $1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, but is still small enough compared to the system scales for quasi-neutrality to be a valid approximation in the bulk.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nD. **Quasi-neutrality is not applicable to non-equilibrium plasmas with $T_e \\gg T_g$; the elevated electron temperature alone prevents electrostatic screening regardless of density and geometry.**\nThis statement is fundamentally false. Quasi-neutrality and Debye screening are core concepts used to describe non-equilibrium plasmas. The elevated electron temperature $T_e$ is a key parameter *in* the definition of the Debye length, it does not invalidate the concept. A higher $T_e$ increases $\\lambda_D$, which means a larger plasma is required to be considered quasi-neutral, but it does not prevent screening altogether.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

The problem is modeled by the linear unsteady diffusion equation for the streamwise velocity, $u(y,t)$, in the half-space $y\\ge 0$.\n\nFirst, we establish the governing mathematical problem based on the provided information. The flow outside the thin EHD forcing region is governed by the unsteady viscous diffusion equation. For a quiescent, incompressible fluid with no pressure gradient, this is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} $$\nwhere $\\nu = \\mu/\\rho$ is the kinematic viscosity of the gas.\n\nThe effect of the localized body force, $F_b(y,t)$, is represented as an equivalent oscillatory shear stress at the wall, $\\tau_w(t)$. This is justified by the given condition that the force decay length $\\ell_e$ is much smaller than the flow penetration depth $\\delta_p$. The effective wall stress is the integral of the body force over the vertical direction:\n$$ \\tau_w(t) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} F_b(y,t)\\,dy = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\Re\\{F_{0}\\exp(-y/\\ell_{e})\\exp(i\\omega t)\\}\\,dy $$\nSince the real part and integral operators are linear, we can commute them:\n$$ \\tau_w(t) = \\Re\\left\\{ \\left( \\int_{0}^{\\infty} F_{0}\\exp(-y/\\ell_{e})\\,dy \\right) \\exp(i\\omega t) \\right\\} $$\nThe integral evaluates to:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{\\infty} F_{0}\\exp(-y/\\ell_{e})\\,dy = F_{0} \\left[ -\\ell_{e}\\exp(-y/\\ell_{e}) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = F_{0}(-\\ell_{e}(0-1)) = F_{0}\\ell_{e} $$\nLet $\\hat{\\tau}_w = F_0 \\ell_e$ be the complex amplitude of the effective wall stress.

Let's determine $k$:\n$$ k = \\sqrt{\\frac{i\\omega}{\\nu}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{\\nu}}\\sqrt{i} $$\nUsing the polar form of $i = \\exp(i\\pi/2)$, its principal square root is $\\sqrt{i} = \\exp(i\\pi/4) = \\cos(\\pi/4) + i\\sin(\\pi/4) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(1+i)$.\nTherefore,\n$$ k = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{\\nu}} \\frac{1+i}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2\\nu}}(1+i) $$\nFor simplicity, let $\\alpha = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2\\nu}}$.

The term $\\exp(-i\\alpha y)$ is a complex number on the unit circle, so its magnitude is $1$. Thus, $|\\exp(-ky)| = \\exp(-\\alpha y)$.\nThe amplitude envelope is:\n$$ |\\hat{u}(y)| = \\left| \\frac{\\hat{\\tau}_w}{\\mu k} \\right| \\exp(-\\alpha y) $$\nThe amplitude at the wall is $|\\hat{u}(0)| = \\left| \\frac{\\hat{\\tau}_w}{\\mu k} \\right|$. The penetration depth $\\delta_p$ is the value of $y$ at which the amplitude decays to $e^{-1}$ of its value at $y=0$:\n$$ |\\hat{u}(\\delta_p)| = e^{-1} |\\hat{u}(0)| $$\n$$ \\left| \\frac{\\hat{\\tau}_w}{\\mu k} \\right| \\exp(-\\alpha \\delta_p) = e^{-1} \\left| \\frac{\\hat{\\tau}_w}{\\mu k} \\right| $$\n$$ \\exp(-\\alpha \\delta_p) = e^{-1} $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives $-\\alpha \\delta_p = -1$, which yields:\n$$ \\delta_p = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} $$\nSubstituting the definition of $\\alpha = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2\\nu}}$:\n$$ \\delta_p = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2\\nu}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\nu}{\\omega}} $$\nThe problem requires the final expression in terms of the frequency $f$ in Hertz, where $\\omega = 2\\pi f$.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and found to be scientifically sound, well-posed, and complete. It describes a standard code verification procedure, the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS), applied to a simplified one-dimensional fluid dynamics equation relevant to near-wall actuation. All necessary parameters, equations, and numerical methods are clearly defined, and the stability conditions for the chosen numerical scheme are met by the provided test cases.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows: first, we derive the necessary analytical expressions. Second, we formulate the numerical scheme. Third, we detail the process for error computation and order of accuracy estimation.\n\n### 1. Manufactured Solution and Source Term Derivation\n\nThe Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS) begins by postulating an analytical solution, known as the manufactured solution. For this problem, it is given as:\n$$u_{\\text{exact}}(y,t) = U_0 e^{-y/\\delta} \\sin(\\omega t) + U_1 e^{-y/(2\\delta)} \\sin(2\\omega t)$$\nThis function must satisfy the governing partial differential equation (PDE):\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} + f(y,t)$$\nTo ensure this, a source term $f(y,t)$ is introduced and defined by rearranging the PDE:\n$$f(y,t) = \\frac{\\partial u_{\\text{exact}}}{\\partial t} - \\nu \\frac{\\partial^2 u_{\\text{exact}}}{\\partial y^2}$$\nWe compute the necessary partial derivatives of $u_{\\text{exact}}(y,t)$.\n\nThe partial derivative with respect to time $t$ is:\n$$\\frac{\\partial u_{\\text{exact}}}{\\partial t} = U_0 e^{-y/\\delta} (\\omega \\cos(\\omega t)) + U_1 e^{-y/(2\\delta)} (2\\omega \\cos(2\\omega t))$$\n\nThe second partial derivative with respect to the spatial coordinate $y$ is found by differentiating twice:\n$$\\frac{\\partial u_{\\text{exact}}}{\\partial y} = U_0 \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\delta}\\right) e^{-y/\\delta} \\sin(\\omega t) + U_1 \\left(-\\frac{1}{2\\delta}\\right) e^{-y/(2\\delta)} \\sin(2\\omega t)$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 u_{\\text{exact}}}{\\partial y^2} = U_0 \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\delta}\\right)^2 e^{-y/\\delta} \\sin(\\omega t) + U_1 \\left(-\\frac{1}{2\\delta}\\right)^2 e^{-y/(2\\delta)} \\sin(2\\omega t)$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 u_{\\text{exact}}}{\\partial y^2} = \\frac{U_0}{\\delta^2} e^{-y/\\delta} \\sin(\\omega t) + \\frac{U_1}{4\\delta^2} e^{-y/(2\\delta)} \\sin(2\\omega t)$$\n\nSubstituting these derivatives into the expression for $f(y,t)$ yields the final form of the manufactured source term:\n$$f(y,t) = \\left( U_0 \\omega e^{-y/\\delta} \\cos(\\omega t) + 2 U_1 \\omega e^{-y/(2\\delta)} \\cos(2\\omega t) \\right) - \\nu \\left( \\frac{U_0}{\\delta^2} e^{-y/\\delta} \\sin(\\omega t) + \\frac{U_1}{4\\delta^2} e^{-y/(2\\delta)} \\sin(2\\omega t) \\right)$$\nThis analytical function will be evaluated at each grid point and time step in the numerical simulation.\n\n### 2. Numerical Discretization and Solver Algorithm\n\nThe problem specifies a finite difference method to solve the governing PDE. The domain $y \\in [0, H]$ is discretized into $N_y$ points with a uniform spacing $h$, such that $y_i = i \\cdot h$ for $i=0, 1, \\dots, N_y-1$. The time domain $t \\in [0, T]$ is discretized with a uniform time step $\\Delta t$, such that $t_n = n \\cdot \\Delta t$. The numerical solution at grid point $y_i$ and time $t_n$ is denoted $u_i^n \\approx u(y_i, t_n)$.\n\nThe time derivative $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}$ is approximated using a first-order forward Euler scheme:\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}\\bigg|_{(y_i, t_n)} \\approx \\frac{u_i^{n+1} - u_i^n}{\\Delta t}$$\n\nThe spatial second derivative $\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}$ is approximated using a second-order central difference scheme:\n$$\\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}\\bigg|_{(y_i, t_n)} \\approx \\frac{u_{i+1}^n - 2u_i^n + u_{i-1}^n}{h^2}$$\n\nSubstituting these approximations into the governing PDE gives the discrete equation at interior grid points ($i=1, \\dots, N_y-2$):\n$$\\frac{u_i^{n+1} - u_i^n}{\\Delta t} = \\nu \\frac{u_{i+1}^n - 2u_i^n + u_{i-1}^n}{h^2} + f(y_i, t_n)$$\n\nRearranging for $u_i^{n+1}$ yields the explicit time-stepping formula:\n$$u_i^{n+1} = u_i^n + \\Delta t \\left( \\nu \\frac{u_{i+1}^n - 2u_i^n + u_{i-1}^n}{h^2} + f_i^n \\right)$$\nwhere $f_i^n = f(y_i, t_n)$.\n\nThe full solver algorithm is:\n1.  **Initialization**: At $t=0$, set the numerical solution field $u^0$ to the exact solution: $u_i^0 = u_{\\text{exact}}(y_i, 0)$ for all $i$.\n2.  **Time Marching**: For each time step $n$ from $0$ to $N_t-1$:\n    a. Calculate the numerical solution at the interior points for the next time step, $u_i^{n+1}$, using the explicit update formula.\n    b. Enforce the time-dependent Dirichlet boundary conditions by setting the boundary values to the exact solution at the new time $t_{n+1}$:\n       $$u_0^{n+1} = u_{\\text{exact}}(0, t_{n+1})$$\n       $$u_{N_y-1}^{n+1} = u_{\\text{exact}}(H, t_{n+1})$$\n3.  **Termination**: The loop ends when the final time $t=T$ is reached.\n\n### 3. Error Analysis and Order of Accuracy\n\nAfter the simulation reaches the final time $T$, the error is computed by comparing the numerical solution $u_{\\text{num}}(y,T)$ with the manufactured solution $u_{\\text{exact}}(y,T)$. The discrete $L^2$-norm of the error is calculated as a Riemann sum:\n$$E = \\left( \\sum_{i=0}^{N_y-1} \\left[u_i^{N_t} - u_{\\text{exact}}(y_i, T)\\right]^2 h \\right)^{1/2}$$\n\nThe observed orders of accuracy are then estimated. For a numerical method with error $E = C h^p$ or $E = C (\\Delta t)^p$, the order $p$ can be found using solutions on two different grids.\n\n- **Spatial Order ($p_s$)**: With a fixed, sufficiently small time step $\\Delta t$, simulations are run for a sequence of spatial grid spacings, $h_1$ and $h_2$. The spatial order is:\n  $$p_s = \\frac{\\ln(E_{h_1}/E_{h_2})}{\\ln(h_1/h_2)}$$\n  For the specified second-order central difference scheme, the theoretical order is $p_s=2$.\n\n- **Temporal Order ($p_t$)**: With a fixed, sufficiently fine spatial grid $h$, simulations are run for a sequence of time steps, $\\Delta t_1$ and $\\Delta t_2$. The temporal order is:\n  $$p_t = \\frac{\\ln(E_{\\Delta t_1}/E_{\\Delta t_2})}{\\ln(\\Delta t_1/\\Delta t_2)}$$\n  For the specified first-order forward Euler scheme, the theoretical order is $p_t=1$.\n\nThe program implements this entire procedure for each of the three test cases, calculates $p_s$ and $p_t$ using the final two refinements in each study, and rounds the results to three decimal places.",
