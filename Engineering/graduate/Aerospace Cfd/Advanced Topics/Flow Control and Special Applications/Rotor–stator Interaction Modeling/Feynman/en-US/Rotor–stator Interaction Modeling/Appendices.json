            "problem": "An unsteady rotor–stator interaction in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for turbomachinery is often modeled in a rotating frame to account for inertial effects that arise from rotation. Consider a rotor of axis aligned with the $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ direction, with constant angular velocity.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of a specific inertial acceleration component in a rotating reference frame, a concept central to the study of fluid mechanics in turbomachinery. We begin by establishing the fundamental kinematic relationship between an inertial (fixed) frame and a rotating frame.\n\nLet the inertial frame be denoted by $I$ and the rotating frame by $R$. The frame $R$ rotates with a constant angular velocity vector $\\mathbf{\\Omega}$ relative to $I$. For any arbitrary vector $\\mathbf{A}$, the time derivative in the inertial frame is related to the time derivative in the rotating frame by the transport theorem:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{A}}{dt}\\bigg|_I = \\frac{d\\mathbf{A}}{dt}\\bigg|_R + \\mathbf{\\Omega} \\times \\mathbf{A}\n$$\n\nLet $\\mathbf{x}$ be the position vector of a fluid particle. Its velocity in the inertial frame (the absolute velocity) is $\\mathbf{v}_{abs} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{x}}{dt}\\big|_I$. Its velocity in the rotating frame (the relative velocity) is $\\mathbf{u}_{rel} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{x}}{dt}\\big|_R$. Applying the transport theorem to the position vector $\\mathbf{x}$, we get:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}_{abs} = \\mathbf{u}_{rel} + \\mathbf{\\Omega} \\times \\mathbf{x}\n$$\n\nThe acceleration in the inertial frame is the time derivative of the absolute velocity, $\\mathbf{a}_{abs} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{v}_{abs}}{dt}\\big|_I$. Applying the transport theorem again, this time to the vector $\\mathbf{v}_{abs}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{a}_{abs} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\bigg|_I (\\mathbf{u}_{rel} + \\mathbf{\\Omega} \\times \\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{d\\mathbf{u}_{rel}}{dt}\\bigg|_I + \\frac{d(\\mathbf{\\Omega} \\times \\mathbf{x})}{dt}\\bigg|_I\n$$\nWe evaluate each term. For the first term, we apply the transport theorem to $\\mathbf{u}_{rel}$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\mathbf{u}_{rel}}{dt}\\bigg|_I = \\frac{d\\mathbf{u}_{rel}}{dt}\\bigg|_R + \\mathbf{\\Omega} \\times \\mathbf{u}_{rel} = \\mathbf{a}_{rel} + \\mathbf{\\Omega} \\times \\mathbf{u}_{rel}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{a}_{rel} = \\frac{d\\mathbf{u}_{rel}}{dt}\\big|_R$ is the acceleration of the particle relative to the rotating frame.\n\nFor the second term, we use the product rule for derivatives, noting that $\\mathbf{\\Omega}$ is constant in time ($\\frac{d\\mathbf{\\Omega}}{dt} = \\mathbf{0}$):\n$$\n\\frac{d(\\mathbf{\\Omega} \\times \\mathbf{x})}{dt}\\bigg|_I = \\left(\\frac{d\\mathbf{\\Omega}}{dt}\\bigg|_I\\right) \\times \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{\\Omega} \\times \\left(\\frac{d\\mathbf{x}}{dt}\\bigg|_I\\right) = \\mathbf{0} + \\mathbf{\\Omega} \\times \\mathbf{v}_{abs}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\mathbf{v}_{abs} = \\mathbf{u}_{rel} + \\mathbf{\\Omega} \\times \\mathbf{x}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{\\Omega} \\times \\mathbf{v}_{abs} = \\mathbf{\\Omega} \\times (\\mathbf{u}_{rel} + \\mathbf{\\Omega} \\times \\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{\\Omega} \\times \\mathbf{u}_{rel} + \\mathbf{\\Omega} \\times (\\mathbf{\\Omega} \\times \\mathbf{x})\n$$\nCombining all terms, the absolute acceleration is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{a}_{abs} = (\\mathbf{a}_{rel} + \\mathbf{\\Omega} \\times \\mathbf{u}_{rel}) + (\\mathbf{\\Omega} \\times \\mathbf{u}_{rel} + \\mathbf{\\Omega} \\times (\\mathbf{\\Omega} \\times \\mathbf{x}))\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{a}_{abs} = \\mathbf{a}_{rel} + 2(\\mathbf{\\Omega} \\times \\mathbf{u}_{rel}) + \\mathbf{\\Omega} \\times (\\mathbf{\\Omega} \\times \\mathbf{x})\n$$\nThis equation decomposes the absolute acceleration into three parts: the relative acceleration ($\\mathbf{a}_{rel}$), the Coriolis acceleration ($\\mathbf{a}_{Cor} = 2(\\mathbf{\\Omega} \\times \\mathbf{u}_{rel})$), and the centripetal acceleration ($\\mathbf{a}_{cen} = \\mathbf{\\Omega} \\times (\\mathbf{\\Omega} \\times \\mathbf{x})$).\n\nThe problem asks for the acceleration component that depends linearly on both the angular velocity vector $\\mathbf{\\Omega}$ and the relative velocity $\\mathbf{u}_{rel}$. This is precisely the Coriolis acceleration:\n$$\n\\mathbf{a}_{Cor} = 2(\\mathbf{\\Omega} \\times \\mathbf{u}_{rel})\n$$\nWe are given the following values to evaluate its magnitude:\n- Angular speed: $\\Omega = 5000 \\ \\mathrm{rpm}$\n- Relative tangential speed: $u_{\\theta} = 150 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}$\n- The angular velocity vector is aligned with the $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ axis: $\\mathbf{\\Omega} = \\Omega \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$.\n- The relative velocity is tangential: $\\mathbf{u}_{rel} = u_{\\theta} \\hat{\\mathbf{\\theta}}$. The problem states the relative velocity is perpendicular to the rotation axis, which is consistent with it lying in the $r-\\theta$ plane. The specification that it is tangential simplifies it to the $\\hat{\\mathbf{\\theta}}$ direction.\n- The radial location $r = 0.3 \\ \\mathrm{m}$ is provided but is not needed for the calculation of the Coriolis acceleration, which depends on velocity, not position.\n\nFirst, we convert the angular speed from revolutions per minute (rpm) to radians per second (rad/s):\n$$\n\\Omega = 5000 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{rev}}{\\mathrm{min}} \\times \\frac{2\\pi \\ \\mathrm{rad}}{1 \\ \\mathrm{rev}} \\times \\frac{1 \\ \\mathrm{min}}{60 \\ \\mathrm{s}} = \\frac{10000\\pi}{60} \\ \\mathrm{rad/s} = \\frac{500\\pi}{3} \\ \\mathrm{rad/s}\n$$\nNow, we compute the cross product $\\mathbf{\\Omega} \\times \\mathbf{u}_{rel}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{\\Omega} \\times \\mathbf{u}_{rel} = (\\Omega \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}) \\times (u_{\\theta} \\hat{\\mathbf{\\theta}}) = \\Omega u_{\\theta} (\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{\\theta}})\n$$\nIn a right-handed cylindrical coordinate system $(r, \\theta, z)$, the cross product of the unit vectors is $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}} \\times \\hat{\\mathbf{\\theta}} = -\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$. Thus, the Coriolis acceleration vector is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{a}_{Cor} = 2 \\Omega u_{\\theta} (-\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}) = -2 \\Omega u_{\\theta} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}\n$$\nThis acceleration is directed radially inward. We are asked for its magnitude, which is:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{a}_{Cor}| = | -2 \\Omega u_{\\theta} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} | = 2 \\Omega u_{\\theta}\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{a}_{Cor}| = 2 \\times \\left(\\frac{500\\pi}{3}\\right) \\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}} \\times 150 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}\n$$\n$$\n|\\mathbf{a}_{Cor}| = 2 \\times \\frac{500\\pi}{3} \\times 150 = 1000\\pi \\times \\frac{150}{3} = 1000\\pi \\times 50 = 50000\\pi \\ \\mathrm{m/s^2}\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value and round to four significant figures:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{a}_{Cor}| \\approx 50000 \\times 3.14159265... \\approx 157079.63 \\ \\mathrm{m/s^2}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $157100 \\ \\mathrm{m/s^2}$, or $1.571 \\times 10^5 \\ \\mathrm{m/s^2}$.\n\nAs a brief comment on its significance: in the momentum equation written for the rotating frame (the Navier-Stokes equations), the Coriolis term appears as a \"body force\" per unit mass, $-2(\\mathbf{\\Omega} \\times \\mathbf{u}_{rel})$. The calculated magnitude of approximately $1.57 \\times 10^5 \\ \\mathrm{m/s^2}$ is enormous, over $16000$ times the acceleration of gravity ($g \\approx 9.81 \\ \\mathrm{m/s^2}$). Within a rotor passage, this immense inertial acceleration must be balanced, primarily by the pressure-gradient force term $-\\frac{1}{\\rho}\\nabla p$. The Coriolis force, acting perpendicular to the relative velocity, deflects the flow and is responsible for creating a large pressure difference between the pressure side and suction side of the rotor blades. This pressure difference is the mechanism by which the rotor does work on the fluid. In the context of rotor-stator interaction, unsteady variations in the incoming relative velocity field (e.g., stator wakes) cause large fluctuations in the Coriolis force, which is a primary driver of unsteady aerodynamic loading and vibration on the rotor blades.",

            "solution": "The primary objective is to compute the relative Mach number, $Ma_{\\mathrm{rel}}$, experienced by a rotor blade, and to discuss the implications for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling. The solution proceeds by first determining the kinematic and thermodynamic properties of the flow.\n\nThe fundamental relationship connecting the absolute velocity vector $\\vec{V}_{\\text{abs}}$ (in the stationary frame of reference) and the relative velocity vector $\\vec{V}_{\\text{rel}}$ (in the rotating frame of reference of the blade) is given by:\n$$\n\\vec{V}_{\\text{rel}} = \\vec{V}_{\\text{abs}} - \\vec{U}\n$$\nwhere $\\vec{U}$ is the velocity of the moving frame, which corresponds to the tangential velocity of the rotor blade.\n\nWe establish a cylindrical coordinate system with the $x$-axis aligned with the machine's axis of rotation, so that $\\vec{e}_x$ is the unit vector in the axial direction and $\\vec{e}_\\theta$ is the unit vector in the circumferential (tangential) direction.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the inflow from the stator is uniform and purely axial. Therefore, the absolute velocity vector is:\n$$\n\\vec{V}_{\\text{abs}} = V_x \\vec{e}_x\n$$\nThe magnitude of the axial velocity is given as $V_x = 200 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}$. Thus, the magnitude of the absolute velocity is $||\\vec{V}_{\\text{abs}}|| = V_x = 200 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}$.\n\nThe rotor blade has a local circumferential speed $U = 250 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}$.

The problem provides the absolute Mach number, $Ma = 0.6$. The absolute Mach number is defined as:\n$$\nMa = \\frac{||\\vec{V}_{\\text{abs}}||}{a} = \\frac{V_x}{a}\n$$\nSolving for $a$:\n$$\na = \\frac{V_x}{Ma} = \\frac{200\\ \\mathrm{m/s}}{0.6} = \\frac{2000}{6}\\ \\mathrm{m/s} = \\frac{1000}{3}\\ \\mathrm{m/s}\n$$\n\nThe problem makes the crucial assumption that the static thermodynamic state, and hence the speed of sound $a$, is the same in both the absolute and relative frames. The relative Mach number, $Ma_{\\mathrm{rel}}$, is defined as the ratio of the magnitude of the relative velocity to this local speed of sound:\n$$\nMa_{\\mathrm{rel}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{rel}}}{a}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $V_{\\text{rel}}$ and $a$:\n$$\nMa_{\\mathrm{rel}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{V_x^2 + U^2}}{V_x / Ma}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values:\n$$\nMa_{\\mathrm{rel}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{102500}\\ \\mathrm{m/s}}{(1000/3)\\ \\mathrm{m/s}} = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{102500}}{1000} \\approx 0.960468\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures as required by the problem statement, we get:\n$$\nMa_{\\mathrm{rel}} \\approx 0.960\n$$\n\nFor the second part of the problem, we consider the implications of this result. A relative Mach number of $Ma_{\\mathrm{rel}} \\approx 0.960$ indicates that the flow entering the rotor passage is in the high subsonic, or transonic, regime. As this flow accelerates over the curved suction surface of the rotor blade, it is highly probable that the local flow velocity will exceed the speed of sound ($Ma_{local} > 1$), creating a region of supersonic flow. This supersonic pocket typically terminates in a normal shock wave, which is a strong discontinuity where the flow properties change abruptly and irreversibly, leading to a significant increase in entropy and a loss of total pressure.\n\nFor a compressible Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) model, this has several key implications:\n$1$. The numerical scheme must be capable of \"capturing\" shocks without generating spurious oscillations. This requires the use of upwind-biased or flux-splitting schemes (e.g., Roe, AUSM family) rather than centrally-differenced schemes.\n$2$. The formation of shocks introduces a major source of aerodynamic loss, which must be accurately predicted by the model.\n$3$. The interaction of the shock with the blade's boundary layer (shock-boundary layer interaction) can lead to flow separation, increased turbulence, and unsteady effects that are challenging to model accurately with standard RANS turbulence models.\n$4$. The computational grid must be sufficiently refined in the vicinity of the leading edge and on the blade surfaces to resolve the shock structure and the high-gradient regions associated with it.\n\nIn conclusion, a relative Mach number near unity is a clear indicator that the flow physics will be dominated by transonic effects, including shock waves, necessitating the use of specialized and robust numerical techniques in any CFD analysis.",

            "solution": "The problem requires determining the necessary temporal resolution for an Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulation of a single-stage axial compressor to capture specific aeroacoustic phenomena without aliasing. The analysis begins from the fundamental principles of turbomachinery noise generation and signal processing.\n\nFirst, we identify the fundamental frequency of the tonal noise generated by the rotor-stator interaction. This frequency is known as the Blade Passing Frequency (BPF). For a rotor with $Z_r$ blades rotating at a frequency $f_{rot}$, the BPF is the rate at which blades pass a fixed point in the stationary frame of reference. It is given by the product of the number of blades and the rotational frequency:\n$$f_{BPF} = Z_r f_{rot}$$\nThe problem provides the number of rotor blades, $Z_r = 18$, and the rotational frequency, $f_{rot} = 250\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$. Substituting these values, we calculate the BPF:\n$$f_{BPF} = 18 \\times 250\\ \\mathrm{Hz} = 4500\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$$\n\nThe objective is to resolve the unsteady flow features up to the third harmonic of the BPF. The harmonics of a fundamental frequency $f$ are integer multiples of that frequency, i.e., $n \\cdot f$ for integer $n \\ge 1$. Therefore, the third harmonic of the BPF is $3 \\times f_{BPF}$. This represents the maximum frequency, $f_{max}$, that the time-resolved simulation must accurately capture.\n$$f_{max} = 3 \\times f_{BPF} = 3 \\times 4500\\ \\mathrm{Hz} = 13500\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$$\n\nTo ensure that a signal containing frequencies up to $f_{max}$ is captured without aliasing, we must adhere to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. The theorem states that for a bandlimited signal with a maximum frequency $f_{max}$, the sampling rate, $f_s$, must be strictly greater than twice the maximum frequency ($f_s > 2 f_{max}$). The critical rate, $2 f_{max}$, is known as the Nyquist rate. To resolve the signal content, the minimum sampling rate required, $f_{s,min}$, is set to this Nyquist rate.\n$$f_{s,min} = 2 f_{max}$$\nUsing the calculated value of $f_{max}$, we find the minimum required sampling rate:\n$$f_{s,min} = 2 \\times 13500\\ \\mathrm{Hz} = 27000\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$$\nThis is the minimum sampling rate in Hertz required to avoid aliasing of the third BPF harmonic.\n\nIn a URANS simulation with a uniform time step, $\\Delta t$, the time-series data of any flow variable is sampled at discrete intervals of $\\Delta t$. The effective sampling rate, $f_s$, is the reciprocal of the time step:\n$$f_s = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t}$$\nTo meet the minimum sampling rate requirement, we must have $f_s \\ge f_{s,min}$. This inequality can be expressed in terms of the time step:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\Delta t} \\ge f_{s,min}$$\n$$\\Delta t \\le \\frac{1}{f_{s,min}}$$\nThis shows that the requirement for a minimum sampling rate translates into a requirement for a maximum permissible time step, $\\Delta t_{max}$. The maximum time step that satisfies the Nyquist criterion is the reciprocal of the minimum sampling rate.\n$$\\Delta t_{max} = \\frac{1}{f_{s,min}}$$\nSubstituting the value of $f_{s,min}$:\n$$\\Delta t_{max} = \\frac{1}{27000}\\ \\mathrm{s}$$\nTherefore, to capture the tonal content up to the third harmonic of the BPF without aliasing, the URANS simulation must be run with a uniform time step no larger than $1/27000$ seconds.\n\nThe two required quantities are the minimum sampling rate, $27000\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$, and the corresponding maximum permissible time step, $1/27000\\ \\mathrm{s}$.",
