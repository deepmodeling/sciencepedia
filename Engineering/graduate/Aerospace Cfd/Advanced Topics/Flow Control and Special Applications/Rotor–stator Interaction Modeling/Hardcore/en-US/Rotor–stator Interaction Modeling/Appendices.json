            "problem": "Consider a canonical rotor–stator interaction setup in an axial turbomachine stage analyzed using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). A stator row delivers a uniform, purely axial inflow to the rotor with absolute inlet Mach number $Ma=0.6$ and axial velocity magnitude $V_{x}=200\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$ at the rotor leading edge plane. The rotor blades have a local circumferential (tangential) speed $U=\\Omega r=250\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$ at the same radius. Assume a perfect gas, locally isentropic inflow at the leading edge, and that the static thermodynamic state (and hence the local speed of sound) is the same in all inertial frames and is unaffected by the rigid rotation of the blade. Using only the definitions of Mach number, the invariance of thermodynamic state across Galilean frames, and the kinematic relation between absolute and relative velocities appropriate for a rotating blade, determine the relative Mach number $Ma_{\\mathrm{rel}}$ of the flow seen by the rotor leading edge.\n\nIn addition, briefly state the implications of your computed $Ma_{\\mathrm{rel}}$ for the possibility of shock formation at the rotor leading edge in a compressible Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) model of rotor–stator interaction.\n\nRound your numerical answer for $Ma_{\\mathrm{rel}}$ to three significant figures. Express the Mach number as a dimensionless number.",
            "solution": "The problem has been validated and is determined to be well-posed, scientifically grounded, and internally consistent.\n\nThe primary objective is to compute the relative Mach number, $Ma_{\\mathrm{rel}}$, experienced by a rotor blade, and to discuss the implications for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling. The solution proceeds by first determining the kinematic and thermodynamic properties of the flow.\n\nThe fundamental relationship connecting the absolute velocity vector $\\vec{V}_{\\text{abs}}$ (in the stationary frame of reference) and the relative velocity vector $\\vec{V}_{\\text{rel}}$ (in the rotating frame of reference of the blade) is given by:\n$$\n\\vec{V}_{\\text{rel}} = \\vec{V}_{\\text{abs}} - \\vec{U}\n$$\nwhere $\\vec{U}$ is the velocity of the moving frame, which corresponds to the tangential velocity of the rotor blade.\n\nWe establish a cylindrical coordinate system with the $x$-axis aligned with the machine's axis of rotation, so that $\\vec{e}_x$ is the unit vector in the axial direction and $\\vec{e}_\\theta$ is the unit vector in the circumferential (tangential) direction.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the inflow from the stator is uniform and purely axial. Therefore, the absolute velocity vector is:\n$$\n\\vec{V}_{\\text{abs}} = V_x \\vec{e}_x\n$$\nThe magnitude of the axial velocity is given as $V_x = 200 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}$. Thus, the magnitude of the absolute velocity is $||\\vec{V}_{\\text{abs}}|| = V_x = 200 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}$.\n\nThe rotor blade has a local circumferential speed $U = 250 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}$. The velocity vector of the blade is purely tangential:\n$$\n\\vec{U} = U \\vec{e}_\\theta\n$$\n\nSubstituting these vector expressions into the kinematic relation gives the relative velocity vector:\n$$\n\\vec{V}_{\\text{rel}} = V_x \\vec{e}_x - U \\vec{e}_\\theta\n$$\nThe magnitude of the relative velocity vector, $V_{\\text{rel}}$, is found by applying the Pythagorean theorem to its orthogonal components:\n$$\nV_{\\text{rel}} = ||\\vec{V}_{\\text{rel}}|| = \\sqrt{V_x^2 + (-U)^2} = \\sqrt{V_x^2 + U^2}\n$$\nPlugging in the given values:\n$$\nV_{\\text{rel}} = \\sqrt{(200\\ \\mathrm{m/s})^2 + (250\\ \\mathrm{m/s})^2} = \\sqrt{40000 + 62500}\\ \\mathrm{m/s} = \\sqrt{102500}\\ \\mathrm{m/s}\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the local speed of sound, $a$. The problem provides the absolute Mach number, $Ma = 0.6$. The absolute Mach number is defined as:\n$$\nMa = \\frac{||\\vec{V}_{\\text{abs}}||}{a} = \\frac{V_x}{a}\n$$\nSolving for $a$:\n$$\na = \\frac{V_x}{Ma} = \\frac{200\\ \\mathrm{m/s}}{0.6} = \\frac{2000}{6}\\ \\mathrm{m/s} = \\frac{1000}{3}\\ \\mathrm{m/s}\n$$\n\nThe problem makes the crucial assumption that the static thermodynamic state, and hence the speed of sound $a$, is the same in both the absolute and relative frames. The relative Mach number, $Ma_{\\mathrm{rel}}$, is defined as the ratio of the magnitude of the relative velocity to this local speed of sound:\n$$\nMa_{\\mathrm{rel}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{rel}}}{a}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $V_{\\text{rel}}$ and $a$:\n$$\nMa_{\\mathrm{rel}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{V_x^2 + U^2}}{V_x / Ma}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values:\n$$\nMa_{\\mathrm{rel}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{102500}\\ \\mathrm{m/s}}{(1000/3)\\ \\mathrm{m/s}} = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{102500}}{1000} \\approx 0.960468\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures as required by the problem statement, we get:\n$$\nMa_{\\mathrm{rel}} \\approx 0.960\n$$\n\nFor the second part of the problem, we consider the implications of this result. A relative Mach number of $Ma_{\\mathrm{rel}} \\approx 0.960$ indicates that the flow entering the rotor passage is in the high subsonic, or transonic, regime. As this flow accelerates over the curved suction surface of the rotor blade, it is highly probable that the local flow velocity will exceed the speed of sound ($Ma_{local} > 1$), creating a region of supersonic flow. This supersonic pocket typically terminates in a normal shock wave, which is a strong discontinuity where the flow properties change abruptly and irreversibly, leading to a significant increase in entropy and a loss of total pressure.\n\nFor a compressible Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) model, this has several key implications:\n$1$. The numerical scheme must be capable of \"capturing\" shocks without generating spurious oscillations. This requires the use of upwind-biased or flux-splitting schemes (e.g., Roe, AUSM family) rather than centrally-differenced schemes.\n$2$. The formation of shocks introduces a major source of aerodynamic loss, which must be accurately predicted by the model.\n$3$. The interaction of the shock with the blade's boundary layer (shock-boundary layer interaction) can lead to flow separation, increased turbulence, and unsteady effects that are challenging to model accurately with standard RANS turbulence models.\n$4$. The computational grid must be sufficiently refined in the vicinity of the leading edge and on the blade surfaces to resolve the shock structure and the high-gradient regions associated with it.\n\nIn conclusion, a relative Mach number near unity is a clear indicator that the flow physics will be dominated by transonic effects, including shock waves, necessitating the use of specialized and robust numerical techniques in any CFD analysis.",

Provide exact values. Express the sampling rate in $\\mathrm{Hz}$ and the time step in $\\mathrm{s}$. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires determining the necessary temporal resolution for an Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulation of a single-stage axial compressor to capture specific aeroacoustic phenomena without aliasing. The analysis begins from the fundamental principles of turbomachinery noise generation and signal processing.\n\nFirst, we identify the fundamental frequency of the tonal noise generated by the rotor-stator interaction. This frequency is known as the Blade Passing Frequency (BPF). For a rotor with $Z_r$ blades rotating at a frequency $f_{rot}$, the BPF is the rate at which blades pass a fixed point in the stationary frame of reference. It is given by the product of the number of blades and the rotational frequency:\n$$f_{BPF} = Z_r f_{rot}$$\nThe problem provides the number of rotor blades, $Z_r = 18$, and the rotational frequency, $f_{rot} = 250\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$. Substituting these values, we calculate the BPF:\n$$f_{BPF} = 18 \\times 250\\ \\mathrm{Hz} = 4500\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$$\n\nThe objective is to resolve the unsteady flow features up to the third harmonic of the BPF. The harmonics of a fundamental frequency $f$ are integer multiples of that frequency, i.e., $n \\cdot f$ for integer $n \\ge 1$. Therefore, the third harmonic of the BPF is $3 \\times f_{BPF}$. This represents the maximum frequency, $f_{max}$, that the time-resolved simulation must accurately capture.\n$$f_{max} = 3 \\times f_{BPF} = 3 \\times 4500\\ \\mathrm{Hz} = 13500\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$$\n\nTo ensure that a signal containing frequencies up to $f_{max}$ is captured without aliasing, we must adhere to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. The theorem states that for a bandlimited signal with a maximum frequency $f_{max}$, the sampling rate, $f_s$, must be strictly greater than twice the maximum frequency ($f_s > 2 f_{max}$). The critical rate, $2 f_{max}$, is known as the Nyquist rate. To resolve the signal content, the minimum sampling rate required, $f_{s,min}$, is set to this Nyquist rate.\n$$f_{s,min} = 2 f_{max}$$\nUsing the calculated value of $f_{max}$, we find the minimum required sampling rate:\n$$f_{s,min} = 2 \\times 13500\\ \\mathrm{Hz} = 27000\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$$\nThis is the minimum sampling rate in Hertz required to avoid aliasing of the third BPF harmonic.\n\nIn a URANS simulation with a uniform time step, $\\Delta t$, the time-series data of any flow variable is sampled at discrete intervals of $\\Delta t$. The effective sampling rate, $f_s$, is the reciprocal of the time step:\n$$f_s = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t}$$\nTo meet the minimum sampling rate requirement, we must have $f_s \\ge f_{s,min}$. This inequality can be expressed in terms of the time step:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\Delta t} \\ge f_{s,min}$$\n$$\\Delta t \\le \\frac{1}{f_{s,min}}$$\nThis shows that the requirement for a minimum sampling rate translates into a requirement for a maximum permissible time step, $\\Delta t_{max}$. The maximum time step that satisfies the Nyquist criterion is the reciprocal of the minimum sampling rate.\n$$\\Delta t_{max} = \\frac{1}{f_{s,min}}$$\nSubstituting the value of $f_{s,min}$:\n$$\\Delta t_{max} = \\frac{1}{27000}\\ \\mathrm{s}$$\nTherefore, to capture the tonal content up to the third harmonic of the BPF without aliasing, the URANS simulation must be run with a uniform time step no larger than $1/27000$ seconds.\n\nThe two required quantities are the minimum sampling rate, $27000\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$, and the corresponding maximum permissible time step, $1/27000\\ \\mathrm{s}$.",

The givens are self-contained and sufficient to derive a unique solution for the requested quantity, $\\mathcal{L}$. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe core of the problem involves calculating and comparing fluxes of various physical quantities across the mixing plane before and after the circumferential averaging process. The flux, $\\Phi_{\\psi}$, of a quantity per unit mass, $\\psi$, convected with axial velocity $V_x$ across the thin annular ring of area $A_{\\text{ring}}=2\\pi r b$ is given by the integral of the differential flux, $d\\Phi_{\\psi} = (\\rho \\psi) (V_x dA)$.

The mixing plane model replaces the $\\theta$-dependent flow field with a circumferentially uniform one that conserves mass and momentum fluxes. Let the mixed-out state be denoted by the subscript 'mix'. The mixed-out swirl velocity, $(V_{\\theta})_{\\text{mix}}$, is constant. Conservation of the axial flux of azimuthal momentum requires that the flux before mixing equals the flux after mixing. The quantity per unit mass for azimuthal momentum is simply $V_{\\theta}$.\nThe flux of azimuthal momentum before mixing is:\n$$ \\Phi_{V_{\\theta}, \\text{true}} = \\rho V_x r b \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} V_{\\theta}(\\theta) \\, d\\theta = \\rho V_x r b \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\left(\\bar{V}_{\\theta} + A\\sin(n\\theta)\\right) \\, d\\theta $$\nSince the integral of $\\sin(n\\theta)$ over a full period $2\\pi$ is zero for any positive integer $n$, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\Phi_{V_{\\theta}, \\text{true}} = \\rho V_x r b \\left[ \\bar{V}_{\\theta}\\theta - \\frac{A}{n}\\cos(n\\theta) \\right]_0^{2\\pi} = \\rho V_x r b (2\\pi \\bar{V}_{\\theta}) $$\nThe flux of azimuthal momentum for the mixed-out state, with uniform swirl velocity $(V_{\\theta})_{\\text{mix}}$, is:\n$$ \\Phi_{V_{\\theta}, \\text{mix}} = \\rho V_x r b \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} (V_{\\theta})_{\\text{mix}} \\, d\\theta = \\rho V_x r b (2\\pi (V_{\\theta})_{\\text{mix}}) $$\nEquating the two fluxes, $\\Phi_{V_{\\theta}, \\text{true}} = \\Phi_{V_{\\theta}, \\text{mix}}$, yields:\n$$ (V_{\\theta})_{\\text{mix}} = \\bar{V}_{\\theta} $$\nThis confirms that the appropriate circumferentially averaged swirl velocity for the stator inflow is the mean swirl velocity, $\\bar{V}_{\\theta}$.

Its conservation is equivalent to the conservation of azimuthal momentum flux already shown, since radius $r$ is constant.\n$$ \\Phi_{\\text{mom,true}} = \\rho V_x r b \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} rV_{\\theta}(\\theta) \\, d\\theta = 2\\pi \\rho V_x r^2 b \\bar{V}_{\\theta} $$\n$$ \\Phi_{\\text{mom,mix}} = \\rho V_x r b \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} r(V_{\\theta})_{\\text{mix}} \\, d\\theta = \\rho V_x r^2 b \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\bar{V}_{\\theta} \\, d\\theta = 2\\pi \\rho V_x r^2 b \\bar{V}_{\\theta} $$\nThus, axial angular momentum flux is conserved.\n\nNow, we evaluate the convected swirl kinetic energy flux, for which the quantity per unit mass is $\\psi = \\frac{1}{2}V_{\\theta}^2$.
