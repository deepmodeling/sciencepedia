Analysis of the Physical Boundary Layer**\n\nThe governing steady one-dimensional linear convection-diffusion equation is:\n$$\na\\,\\frac{du}{dx} = \\nu\\,\\frac{d^2u}{dx^2}\n$$\nwhere the advection speed $a  0$ and the diffusivity $\\nu  0$. The equation is a second-order linear ordinary differential equation, which can be rearranged to $\\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} - \\frac{a}{\\nu}\\frac{du}{dx} = 0$. The characteristic equation is $r^2 - (\\frac{a}{\\nu})r = 0$, which has roots $r_1=0$ and $r_2=a/\\nu$. The general solution is therefore:\n$$\nu(x) = C_1 + C_2 e^{\\frac{a}{\\nu}x}\n$$\nApplying the boundary conditions $u(0)=u_0$ and $u(1)=u_1$ allows us to solve for the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$.\nAt $x=0$: $u_0 = C_1 + C_2$.\nAt $x=1$: $u_1 = C_1 + C_2 e^{a/\\nu}$.\nSolving this system yields the exact solution:\n$$\nu(x) = u_0 + (u_1 - u_0) \\frac{e^{\\frac{a}{\\nu}x} - 1}{e^{\\frac{a}{\\nu}} - 1}\n$$\nThe problem becomes interesting in the convection-dominated limit, where the magnitude of the Péclet number $Pe = \\frac{|a|L}{\\nu}$ (with domain length $L=1$) is large, i.e., $|a|/\\nu \\gg 1$. Since $a0$, the term $a/\\nu$ is a large negative number.\nIn this limit, for any $x  0$, the term $e^{\\frac{a}{\\nu}x}$ decays very rapidly. The term $e^{a/\\nu}$ in the denominator approaches $0$. The solution in the interior of the domain ($x \\gg \\nu/|a|$) approaches:\n$$\nu(x) \\approx u_0 + (u_1 - u_0) \\frac{0 - 1}{0 - 1} = u_1\n$$\nPhysically, since $a0$, the flow is from right ($x=1$) to left ($x=0$). The boundary at $x=1$ is the inflow boundary, and its value $u_1$ is convected across the domain. The boundary condition at the outflow, $u(0)=u_0$, cannot be satisfied by the convective transport. Diffusion must act to adjust the solution from the interior value of $u_1$ to the boundary value of $u_0$. This adjustment occurs in a thin layer near the outflow boundary, $x=0$.\nThe length scale of this exponential decay is determined by the term $e^{\\frac{a}{\\nu}x} = e^{-x/(\\nu/|a|)}$. The characteristic thickness of this **physical boundary layer** is $\\delta_{phys} \\sim \\nu/|a|$. This thickness depends only on the physical parameters $a$ and $\\nu$, not on any numerical discretization.\n\n**2. Analysis of Numerical Layers from Discretization**\n\nThe numerical solution's behavior depends on the chosen scheme for the convection term. The diffusion term is discretized with a second-order central difference: $\\nu \\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} \\approx \\nu \\frac{u_{i+1} - 2u_i + u_{i-1}}{\\Delta x^2}$.\n\n*   **First-Order Upwind Scheme:** Since $a0$ (flow from right to left), the upwind scheme for $a \\frac{du}{dx}$ uses the value from the upstream node $i+1$: $a \\frac{u_{i+1} - u_i}{\\Delta x}$. A Taylor series expansion shows this introduces a leading truncation error that acts like a diffusion term:\n    $$\n    a \\frac{u_{i+1} - u_i}{\\Delta x} = a\\left(\\frac{du}{dx} + \\frac{\\Delta x}{2}\\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} + \\mathcal{O}(\\Delta x^2)\\right)\n    $$\n    The discretized equation is thus a model for a modified differential equation:\n    $$\n    a \\frac{du}{dx} \\approx \\left(\\nu - a \\frac{\\Delta x}{2}\\right) \\frac{d^2u}{dx^2} = \\left(\\nu + \\frac{|a|\\Delta x}{2}\\right) \\frac{d^2u}{dx^2}\n    $$\n    The scheme introduces a **numerical diffusivity** $\\nu_{num} = \\frac{|a|\\Delta x}{2}$. When the grid is coarse, such that the cell Péclet number $Pe_{\\Delta} = \\frac{|a|\\Delta x}{\\nu} \\gg 1$, this numerical diffusivity dominates the physical diffusivity $\\nu$. The resulting computed boundary layer at $x=0$ is artificially smeared, and its thickness scales as $\\delta_{num} \\sim \\frac{\\nu_{eff}}{|a|} \\approx \\frac{\\nu_{num}}{|a|} = \\frac{|a|\\Delta x/2}{|a|} = \\frac{\\Delta x}{2}$. A layer whose thickness is proportional to the grid spacing $\\Delta x$ is a **numerical layer**.\n\n*   **Second-Order Central Difference Scheme:** This scheme approximates the convection term as $a \\frac{u_{i+1} - u_{i-1}}{2\\Delta x}$. This scheme is not dissipative but is prone to non-physical oscillations when convection dominates. The solution to the difference equation becomes oscillatory when $Pe_{\\Delta}  2$. These oscillations, which have a characteristic wavelength of $2\\Delta x$, can be misidentified as \"layers,\" especially near boundaries where the scheme struggles to satisfy the boundary condition without over/undershooting. The problem statement's mention of \"an additional thin layer near $x=1$\" is characteristic of such an artifact produced by a central difference scheme on a coarse grid. The thickness of such a feature is proportional to $\\Delta x$.\n\nWith this understanding, we evaluate each statement.\n\n**Option A:** Under systematic grid refinement, a genuine physical boundary layer thickness remains approximately constant in physical units once sufficiently resolved, whereas the thickness of a numerical layer shrinks in proportion to the grid spacing $\\Delta x$; observing the latter scaling indicates a numerical artifact.\n**Analysis:** This statement correctly describes the expected behavior. A physical feature's properties are inherent to the PDE; a convergent numerical method should capture these properties with increasing accuracy as $\\Delta x \\to 0$. Once the grid is fine enough to resolve the feature (i.e., $\\Delta x \\ll \\delta_{phys}$), the computed thickness will stabilize at the physical value $\\sim \\nu/|a|$. In contrast, numerical layers, caused by discretization error (e.g., numerical diffusion from upwinding or oscillations from central differencing), have a characteristic size proportional to $\\Delta x$. As $\\Delta x \\to 0$, these artifacts shrink and eventually vanish. This grid refinement study is a fundamental verification technique in CFD.\n**Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**Option B:** If the molecular diffusivity $\\nu$ is increased by a factor $\\alpha1$ with $a$ and boundary conditions fixed, a physical boundary layer thickens proportionally with $\\alpha$, whereas a numerical layer exhibits negligible dependence on $\\nu$ and depends primarily on $\\Delta x$ and the advection discretization; observing proportional thickening with $\\nu$ identifies a physical layer.\n**Analysis:** This describes a parameter study. The physical boundary layer thickness scales as $\\delta_{phys} \\sim \\nu/|a|$. Increasing $\\nu$ by a factor $\\alpha$ will increase $\\delta_{phys}$ by the same factor. This is a direct test of the physical scaling law. A numerical layer, on the other hand, has a thickness determined primarily by the grid spacing, such as $\\sim \\Delta x$ for the artifacts discussed. In the limit of a coarse grid ($Pe_{\\Delta} \\gg 1$), this thickness shows little to no dependence on $\\nu$. Therefore, observing the solution's sensitivity to a physical parameter like $\\nu$ provides a clear method to distinguish between a feature governed by physics and one governed by the numerics.\n**Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**Option C:** On meshes for which the local cell Péclet number $Pe_{\\Delta}=\\dfrac{|a|\\Delta x}{\\nu}$ is bounded by a modest constant (for example, $Pe_{\\Delta}\\le 2$), replacing a first-order upwind discretization of the convection term by a second-order central difference should not remove a genuine physical boundary layer; if a layer disappears or relocates under such a scheme change, it is indicative of a numerical layer.\n**Analysis:** A physical boundary layer is a feature of the underlying PDE and must be present in the solution of any consistent numerical scheme. Changing the scheme will alter the accuracy of its representation, but not its existence or location. The condition $Pe_{\\Delta} \\le 2$ ensures the central difference scheme is free of oscillations, providing a meaningful comparison to the always-monotonic upwind scheme. If a feature observed with one scheme (e.g., a spurious layer at $x=1$ with central differencing on a coarse grid) vanishes when switching to another (e.g., upwinding), it confirms the feature was a numerical artifact of the first scheme. This principle of testing for scheme-dependence is a valid verification method.\n**Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**Option D:** In the stated configuration with $a0$, any physical boundary layer must occur at the inflow boundary $x=1$; therefore, a sharp gradient near $x=0$ is necessarily a numerical artifact.\n**Analysis:** This statement fundamentally misunderstands the physics. With $a0$, the flow is from right to left. The inflow boundary is $x=1$, and the outflow boundary is $x=0$. In convection-dominated flows, boundary layers form at outflow boundaries where diffusive effects must enforce a boundary condition that is inconsistent with the value convected from upstream. Our derivation of the exact solution confirms the physical boundary layer is located at the outflow boundary, $x=0$. The statement's premise is false, and consequently, its conclusion is also false. The sharp gradient near $x=0$ *is* the physical boundary layer.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option E:** For the steady solution obtained via transient time integration, sensitivity of the layer thickness to the time step $\\Delta t$ (with spatial discretization and physical parameters fixed) is a hallmark of a physical boundary layer; numerical layers are independent of $\\Delta t$.\n**Analysis:** The problem concerns the solution to the *steady-state* equation. When a steady state is found by marching a time-dependent equation, the final, converged solution must be independent of the time step $\\Delta t$ used to reach it. Any dependence of the steady solution on $\\Delta t$ indicates an error in the numerical implementation, such as insufficient convergence or a time-marching scheme that contaminates the steady state. The properties of both physical and numerical layers (which arise from spatial discretization) in the steady state are independent of the transient path. This statement incorrectly associates a property of a flawed numerical process with a physical characteristic.\n**Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\nIn summary, statements A, B, and C all describe valid and practical criteria used in scientific computing to distinguish between physical phenomena and numerical artifacts.",
