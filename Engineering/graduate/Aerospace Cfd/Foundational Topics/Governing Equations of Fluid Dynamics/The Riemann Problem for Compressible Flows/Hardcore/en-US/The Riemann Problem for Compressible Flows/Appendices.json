The derivation and solution are presented below.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Linearized Expression for Interfacial Pressure $p^{*}$.**\n\nThe one-dimensional, inviscid, compressible flow is governed by the Euler equations. For the analysis of wave propagation, it is convenient to consider the characteristic form of these equations. For simple isentropic waves, the changes in pressure $dp$ and velocity $du$ are related along the paths of acoustic disturbances (the characteristics), which propagate at speeds $u \\pm c$ relative to a fixed observer. The relationship is given by the compatibility equations:\n$$ du \\pm \\frac{dp}{\\rho c} = 0 $$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the density, $c$ is the speed of sound given by $c^2 = (\\partial p / \\partial \\rho)_s$ for an isentropic process, and $u$ is the fluid velocity. The '$+$' sign corresponds to a left-traveling wave (in the sense of information propagation relative to the fluid, along characteristic $dx/dt = u-c$), and the '$-$' sign corresponds to a right-traveling wave (along characteristic $dx/dt = u+c$).\n\nThe solution to a Riemann problem involves a left-traveling wave, a right-traveling wave, and a contact discontinuity separating them. The state between the two waves is known as the \"star\" region. Across the contact discontinuity, pressure and velocity are continuous. Let these values be $p^*$ and $u^*$.\n\nThe left-traveling wave separates the initial left state $(\\rho_L, u_L, p_L)$ from the left star state $(\\rho_L^*, u^*, p^*)$. The right-traveling wave separates the initial right state $(\\rho_R, u_R, p_R)$ from the right star state $(\\rho_R^*, u^*, p^*)$.\n\nWe assume a linearized acoustic model, which is valid for weak waves where the changes in state variables are small. This allows us to integrate the differential characteristic relations by treating the acoustic impedance, $A = \\rho c$, as a constant across each wave ($A_L = \\rho_L c_L$ for the left wave and $A_R = \\rho_R c_R$ for the right wave).\n\n1.  **Relation across the left-traveling wave:**\n    This wave connects state $L$ to the star region.
