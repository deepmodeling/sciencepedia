This practice demonstrates analytically why only schemes derived from the integral conservation form can correctly predict the speed of a shock .

            "problem": "Consider the one-dimensional inviscid Burgers equation, used as a scalar model for advective transport in the inviscid compressible Euler equations, given in conservation form by $u_{t} + \\partial_{x}\\left(\\frac{1}{2} u^{2}\\right) = 0$. In the context of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), shocks arise for Riemann initial data $u(x,0) = u_{L}$ for $x  0$ and $u(x,0) = u_{R}$ for $x > 0$ with $u_{L} > u_{R}$. \n\n1.

            "solution": "The problem is divided into three parts. First, we derive the shock speed for the conservative form of the one-dimensional inviscid Burgers' equation. Second, we derive the shock speed for a specific nonconservative finite-volume discretization. Third, we compute the difference between these two speeds.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the conservative shock speed, $s_{c}$.\nThe one-dimensional inviscid Burgers' equation in conservation form is given by\n$$ u_{t} + \\partial_{x}\\left( f(u) \\right) = 0, \\quad \\text{where } f(u) = \\frac{1}{2} u^{2} $$\nThe integral form of this conservation law over a fixed spatial domain $[x_1, x_2]$ is\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}} u(x,t) \\, dx + f(u(x_2,t)) - f(u(x_1,t)) = 0 $$\nWe analyze a weak solution in the form of a single discontinuity (a shock) traveling at a constant speed $s_{c}$. The position of the shock is $x_s(t) = s_{c}t$. The solution is piecewise constant, given the Riemann initial data:\n$$ u(x,t) = \\begin{cases} u_{L}  \\text{if } x  x_s(t) \\\\ u_{R}  \\text{if } x > x_s(t) \\end{cases} $$\nLet our control volume $[x_1, x_2]$ be fixed such that the shock is initially inside it and remains inside for some time. We can evaluate the integral:\n$$ \\int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}} u(x,t) \\, dx = \\int_{x_{1}}^{x_s(t)} u_{L} \\, dx + \\int_{x_s(t)}^{x_{2}} u_{R} \\, dx = u_{L}(x_s(t) - x_1) + u_{R}(x_2 - x_s(t)) $$\nNow, we differentiate this expression with respect to time $t$. The terms $u_L x_1$ and $u_R x_2$ are constant and their derivatives are zero.\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt} \\int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}} u(x,t) \\, dx = u_{L} \\frac{dx_s}{dt} - u_{R} \\frac{dx_s}{dt} = (u_{L} - u_{R}) s_{c} $$\nThe flux term in the integral conservation law is $f(u(x_1,t)) - f(u(x_2,t))$. Since $x_1$ is to the left of the shock and $x_2$ is to the right, we have $u(x_1,t) = u_{L}$ and $u(x_2,t) = u_{R}$. The flux difference is therefore\n$$ f(u_L) - f(u_R) = \\frac{1}{2}u_{L}^{2} - \\frac{1}{2}u_{R}^{2} $$\nSubstituting these results back into the integral conservation law, we get\n$$ (u_{L} - u_{R}) s_{c} + \\left( \\frac{1}{2}u_{R}^{2} - \\frac{1}{2}u_{L}^{2} \\right) = 0 $$\nThis can be rearranged to the standard Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition $s_{c}[u] = [f(u)]$, where $[q] = q_L - q_R$.\n$$ s_{c}(u_{L} - u_{R}) = f(u_{L}) - f(u_R) = \\frac{1}{2}u_{L}^{2} - \\frac{1}{2}u_{R}^{2} $$\nSince a shock exists, $u_{L} \\neq u_{R}$, and we can divide by $(u_L - u_R)$.\n$$ s_{c} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}(u_{L}^{2} - u_{R}^{2})}{u_{L} - u_{R}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}(u_{L} - u_{R})(u_{L} + u_R)}{u_{L} - u_{R}} $$\nThis yields the conservative shock speed:\n$$ s_{c} = \\frac{1}{2}(u_{L} + u_{R}) $$\n\nPart 2: Derivation of the nonconservative shock speed, $s_{nc}$.\nWe are given the nonconservative advective form of the equation, $u_{t} + u u_{x} = 0$, discretized as:\n$$ \\frac{d u_{i}}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\Delta x}\\left[\\widehat{a}_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}\\left(u_{i+1} - u_{i}\\right) - \\widehat{a}_{i-\\frac{1}{2}}\\left(u_{i} - u_{i-1}\\right)\\right] = 0 $$\nwith the interfacial advective coefficient $\\widehat{a}_{i+\\frac{1}{2}} = \\alpha u_{i} + (1 - \\alpha) u_{i+1}$.\nThe product $u u_x$ is a nonconservative product. The weak solution, and specifically the speed of a discontinuity, depends on the path taken in state space between the left and right states. A numerical scheme for a nonconservative equation implicitly defines this path and, consequently, the shock speed. In this finite-volume-like scheme, the term $\\widehat{a}_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}$ represents the numerical advection speed at the interface between cell $i$ and cell $i+1$. The speed of a discontinuity propagating across this interface is determined by this numerically defined velocity.\nFor a single, sharp discontinuity located at the interface $i+\\frac{1}{2}$, a jump-condition analysis consistent with the theory of nonconservative products identifies the shock speed $s_{nc}$ with the interface velocity $\\widehat{a}_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}$. The states on the left and right of this interface are $u_i = u_L$ and $u_{i+1} = u_R$, respectively.\nTherefore, the shock speed predicted by this nonconservative scheme is:\n$$ s_{nc} = \\widehat{a}_{i+\\frac{1}{2}} \\rvert_{u_i=u_L, u_{i+1}=u_R} $$\nSubstituting the definition of $\\widehat{a}_{i+\\frac{1}{2}}$:\n$$ s_{nc} = \\alpha u_{L} + (1 - \\alpha) u_{R} $$\nThis result shows that the shock speed is a linear interpolation of the left and right states, with the weighting controlled by the parameter $\\alpha$.\n\nPart 3: Discrepancy between nonconservative and conservative shock speeds.\nWe now compute the difference $s_{nc} - s_{c}$ using the expressions derived in the previous parts.\n$$ s_{nc} - s_{c} = \\left[ \\alpha u_{L} + (1 - \\alpha) u_{R} \\right] - \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(u_{L} + u_{R}) \\right] $$\nWe group the terms multiplying $u_L$ and $u_R$:\n$$ s_{nc} - s_{c} = \\left( \\alpha - \\frac{1}{2} \\right) u_{L} + \\left( 1 - \\alpha - \\frac{1}{2} \\right) u_{R} $$\n$$ s_{nc} - s_{c} = \\left( \\alpha - \\frac{1}{2} \\right) u_{L} + \\left( \\frac{1}{2} - \\alpha \\right) u_{R} $$\nFactoring out the common term $(\\alpha - \\frac{1}{2})$:\n$$ s_{nc} - s_{c} = \\left( \\alpha - \\frac{1}{2} \\right) u_{L} - \\left( \\alpha - \\frac{1}{2} \\right) u_{R} $$\nThis gives the final closed-form expression for the discrepancy:\n$$ s_{nc} - s_{c} = \\left(\\alpha - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)(u_{L} - u_{R}) $$\nThis result demonstrates that the nonconservative scheme yields the correct shock speed only if $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{2}$. For any other value of $\\alpha \\in [0,1]$, the scheme will produce a shock propagating at an incorrect speed, with the error being proportional to the strength of the shock, $(u_L - u_R)$, and the bias parameter $\\alpha$.",

            "solution": "This problem addresses the critical concept of free-stream preservation in the numerical solution of the compressible Euler equations on curvilinear grids. This property, which is a specific manifestation of the Geometric Conservation Law (GCL), requires that a numerical scheme be able to exactly preserve a uniform flow field, which is a trivial solution of the continuous governing equations. Failure to do so introduces spurious source terms that contaminate the entire numerical solution. The analysis hinges on the discrete analogues of the metric identities that arise from the transformation of coordinates.\n\nFirst, we will analyze the given nonconservative discretization to derive the free-stream residual. Then, based on this analysis, we will construct a conservative metric evaluation that guarantees the residual is identically zero.\n\nThe continuity equation in physical Cartesian coordinates $(x,y)$ is given by\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial(\\rho u)}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial(\\rho v)}{\\partial y} = 0\n$$\nFor a uniform free stream, the variables $(\\rho_{\\infty}, u_{\\infty}, v_{\\infty})$ are constant in both space and time. Consequently, all partial derivatives are zero, and the equation is trivially satisfied. The challenge is to ensure this property is maintained after discretization on a curvilinear grid.\n\nThe discrete form of the continuity equation's spatial derivative terms for a uniform free stream is given as the residual $R$:\n$$\nR = D_{\\xi}(\\rho_{\\infty} U^{\\xi}_{\\mathrm{nc}}) + D_{\\eta}(\\rho_{\\infty} U^{\\eta}_{\\mathrm{nc}})\n$$\nwhere $D_{\\xi}$ and $D_{\\eta}$ are the discrete operators used for the flux divergence. Since the free-stream state $(\\rho_{\\infty}, u_{\\infty}, v_{\\infty})$ is constant, we can factor it out of the discrete operators:\n$$\nR = \\rho_{\\infty} \\left[ D_{\\xi}(U^{\\xi}_{\\mathrm{nc}}) + D_{\\eta}(U^{\\eta}_{\\mathrm{nc}}) \\right]\n$$\nThe nonconservative contravariant velocities are given by\n$$\nU^{\\xi}_{\\mathrm{nc}} = u_{\\infty} (J \\xi_{x})_{\\mathrm{nc}} + v_{\\infty} (J \\xi_{y})_{\\mathrm{nc}}\n$$\n$$\nU^{\\eta}_{\\mathrm{nc}} = u_{\\infty} (J \\eta_{x})_{\\mathrm{nc}} + v_{\\infty} (J \\eta_{y})_{\\mathrm{nc}}\n$$\nThe problem statement defines the nonconservative metrics in a slightly convoluted manner. It defines $\\xi_{x}^{\\mathrm{nc}} = (\\widehat{D}_{\\eta} y)/\\widehat{J}$ and then uses the term $J \\xi_{x}^{\\mathrm{nc}}$ in the flux. This introduces an ambiguous ratio of Jacobians, $J/\\widehat{J}$. The standard formulation of this problem, which we will adopt for a tractable analysis, assumes the nonconservative Jacobian-weighted metrics are defined directly by discretizing the continuous identities $J\\xi_x=y_\\eta$, $J\\xi_y=-x_\\eta$, etc., using a separate set of operators, $\\widehat{D}_{\\xi}$ and $\\widehat{D}_{\\eta}$. These definitions are:\n$$\n(J \\xi_{x})_{\\mathrm{nc}} = \\widehat{D}_{\\eta} y\n$$\n$$\n(J \\xi_{y})_{\\mathrm{nc}} = -\\widehat{D}_{\\eta} x\n$$\n$$\n(J \\eta_{x})_{\\mathrm{nc}} = -\\widehat{D}_{\\xi} y\n$$\n$$\n(J \\eta_{y})_{\\mathrm{nc}} = \\widehat{D}_{\\xi} x\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for the residual $R$:\n$$\nR = \\rho_{\\infty} \\left[ D_{\\xi} \\left( u_{\\infty} (\\widehat{D}_{\\eta} y) + v_{\\infty} (-\\widehat{D}_{\\eta} x) \\right) + D_{\\eta} \\left( u_{\\infty} (-\\widehat{D}_{\\xi} y) + v_{\\infty} (\\widehat{D}_{\\xi} x) \\right) \\right]\n$$\nSince $u_{\\infty}$ and $v_{\\infty}$ are constants, they can also be factored out:\n$$\nR = \\rho_{\\infty} u_{\\infty} \\left[ D_{\\xi}(\\widehat{D}_{\\eta} y) + D_{\\eta}(-\\widehat{D}_{\\xi} y) \\right] + \\rho_{\\infty} v_{\\infty} \\left[ D_{\\xi}(-\\widehat{D}_{\\eta} x) + D_{\\eta}(\\widehat{D}_{\\xi} x) \\right]\n$$\nRearranging the terms yields the final expression for the discrete free-stream residual:\n$$\nR = \\rho_{\\infty} u_{\\infty} \\left( D_{\\xi} \\widehat{D}_{\\eta} y - D_{\\eta} \\widehat{D}_{\\xi} y \\right) - \\rho_{\\infty} v_{\\infty} \\left( D_{\\xi} \\widehat{D}_{\\eta} x - D_{\\eta} \\widehat{D}_{\\xi} x \\right)\n$$\nThis residual is, in general, non-zero. The loss of free-stream preservation arises for two primary reasons explicitly shown in this expression:\n1.  **Mismatch between discrete operators**: The expression involves operators $D_{\\xi}$ and $D_{\\eta}$ for the flux divergence, and $\\widehat{D}_{\\xi}$ and $\\widehat{D}_{\\eta}$ for the metric calculations. If $D_{\\xi} \\neq \\widehat{D}_{\\xi}$ or $D_{\\eta} \\neq \\widehat{D}_{\\eta}$, there is no mathematical basis to expect cancellation of the terms. The discrete operations are not consistently applied.\n2.  **Discrete failure of the metric identities**: Even if the operators are matched (i.e., $\\widehat{D}_{\\xi} = D_{\\xi}$ and $\\widehat{D}_{\\eta} = D_{\\eta}$), the residual becomes $R = \\rho_{\\infty} u_{\\infty} (D_{\\xi} D_{\\eta} - D_{\\eta} D_{\\xi})y - \\rho_{\\infty} v_{\\infty} (D_{\\xi} D_{\\eta} - D_{\\eta} D_{\\xi})x$. This is non-zero if the discrete operators $D_{\\xi}$ and $D_{\\eta}$ do not commute, i.e., $[D_{\\xi}, D_{\\eta}] \\equiv D_{\\xi}D_{\\eta} - D_{\\eta}D_{\\xi} \\neq 0$. In the continuous case, the corresponding metric identities, e.g., $\\partial_{\\xi}(y_{\\eta}) + \\partial_{\\eta}(-y_{\\xi}) = y_{\\eta\\xi} - y_{\\xi\\eta} = 0$, rely on the equality of mixed partial derivatives (Schwarz's theorem). General discrete difference operators do not commute, so their discrete analogue is not automatically satisfied. This non-zero residual acts as a numerical source term, violating the GCL.\n\nTo ensure free-stream preservation, the residual $R$ must be identically zero for any uniform free-stream state $(\\rho_{\\infty}, u_{\\infty}, v_{\\infty})$. This means the coefficients of $u_{\\infty}$ and $v_{\\infty}$ in the residual expression must independently be zero. This requires that the Jacobian-weighted metric components $(J\\xi_x, J\\xi_y, J\\eta_x, J\\eta_y)$ satisfy the discrete metric identities (or GCL):\n$$\nD_{\\xi}(J\\xi_x) + D_{\\eta}(J\\eta_x) = 0\n$$\n$$\nD_{\\xi}(J\\xi_y) + D_{\\eta}(J\\eta_y) = 0\n$$\nThe crucial step is to define the metric terms in such a way that these discrete identities are satisfied *by construction*. This is achieved by using the *same* discrete operators, $D_{\\xi}$ and $D_{\\eta}$, for both the metric calculations and the flux divergence. We propose the following conservative metric evaluation by directly discretizing the continuous relations $J\\xi_x = y_{\\eta}$, $J\\xi_y = -x_{\\eta}$, etc.:\n$$\n(J \\xi_x)_{\\mathrm{cons}} = D_{\\eta} y\n$$\n$$\n(J \\xi_y)_{\\mathrm{cons}} = -D_{\\eta} x\n$$\n$$\n(J \\eta_x)_{\\mathrm{cons}} = -D_{\\xi} y\n$$\n$$\n(J \\eta_y)_{\\mathrm{cons}} = D_{\\xi} x\n$$\nLet us substitute these definitions into the discrete metric identities to verify their validity.\nFor the first identity:\n$$\nD_{\\xi}((J\\xi_x)_{\\mathrm{cons}}) + D_{\\eta}((J\\eta_x)_{\\mathrm{cons}}) = D_{\\xi}(D_{\\eta} y) + D_{\\eta}(-D_{\\xi} y) = (D_{\\xi}D_{\\eta} - D_{\\eta}D_{\\xi})y\n$$\nFor the second identity:\n$$\nD_{\\xi}((J\\xi_y)_{\\mathrm{cons}}) + D_{\\eta}((J\\eta_y)_{\\mathrm{cons}}) = D_{\\xi}(-D_{\\eta} x) + D_{\\eta}(D_{\\xi} x) = (-D_{\\xi}D_{\\eta} + D_{\\eta}D_{\\xi})x = -(D_{\\xi}D_{\\eta} - D_{\\eta}D_{\\xi})x\n$$\nThe expressions are zero if and only if the operators $D_{\\xi}$ and $D_{\\eta}$ commute. The problem states that the operators are \"linear, constant-coefficient\" and act on a \"uniform grid.\" Let a general 1D linear constant-coefficient operator be defined by a stencil $c_k$: $D_{\\xi} f_{i,j} = \\sum_k c_k f_{i+k, j}$. Similarly, $D_{\\eta} f_{i,j} = \\sum_l c'_l f_{i, j+l}$. Applying these operators in sequence:\n$$\n(D_{\\xi} D_{\\eta}) f_{i,j} = D_{\\xi} \\left( \\sum_l c'_l f_{i, j+l} \\right) = \\sum_k c_k \\left( \\sum_l c'_l f_{i+k, j+l} \\right) = \\sum_{k,l} c_k c'_l f_{i+k, j+l}\n$$\n$$\n(D_{\\eta} D_{\\xi}) f_{i,j} = D_{\\eta} \\left( \\sum_k c_k f_{i+k, j} \\right) = \\sum_l c'_l \\left( \\sum_k c_k f_{i+k, j+l} \\right) = \\sum_{k,l} c'_l c_k f_{i+k, j+l}\n$$\nSince scalar multiplication is commutative ($c_k c'_l = c'_l c_k$), we have $D_{\\xi} D_{\\eta} = D_{\\eta} D_{\\xi}$. The conditions specified in the problem statement guarantee that the operators commute. Therefore, the proposed metric definitions satisfy the discrete metric identities and ensure that the free-stream residual is identically zero. This is the strictly conservative metric evaluation required.\n\nThe proposed Jacobian-weighted contravariant metric components that satisfy the GCL are thus given by the application of the flux divergence operators $D_\\xi$ and $D_\\eta$ to the physical coordinate functions $x$ and $y$.",

            "solution": "The user has provided a problem in the field of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), specifically concerning numerical methods for the compressible Euler equations. The task is to identify which of the proposed strategies for ameliorating the \"carbuncle phenomenon\" are both conservative and effective.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\n-   **Governing Equations:** $2$-D compressible Euler equations in conservation form:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{U}}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{F}(\\boldsymbol{U})}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{G}(\\boldsymbol{U})}{\\partial y} = \\boldsymbol{0}.\n    $$\n-   **State Vector:** The vector of conserved variables is $\\boldsymbol{U} = [\\rho, \\rho u, \\rho v, \\rho E]^{\\top}$.\n-   **Flux Vectors:** $\\boldsymbol{F}(\\boldsymbol{U})$ is the flux in the $x$-direction, and $\\boldsymbol{G}(\\boldsymbol{U})$ is the flux in the $y$-direction.\n-   **Flow Scenario:** Inviscid flow over a blunt body at a high supersonic Mach number.\n-   **Discretization Method:** Finite volume on a Cartesian mesh with cells indexed by $(i,j)$ and piecewise constant states per cell.\n-   **Numerical Scheme:** A conservative finite volume update:\n    $$\n    \\boldsymbol{U}_{i,j}^{n+1} = \\boldsymbol{U}_{i,j}^{n} - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta x}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{F}}_{i+\\frac{1}{2},j} - \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{F}}_{i-\\frac{1}{2},j}\\right) - \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta y}\\left(\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{G}}_{i,j+\\frac{1}{2}} - \\widehat{\\boldsymbol{G}}_{i,j-\\frac{1}{2}}\\right).\n    $$\n-   **Numerical Fluxes:** $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{F}}$ and $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{G}}$ are consistent numerical fluxes.\n-   **Shock Jump Conditions:** For a stationary, grid-aligned shock, the discrete conservation implies the Rankine–Hugoniot conditions: $s\\,[\\boldsymbol{U}] = [\\boldsymbol{F}_n(\\boldsymbol{U})]$, with $\\boldsymbol{F}_n(\\boldsymbol{U}) = n_x\\,\\boldsymbol{F}(\\boldsymbol{U}) + n_y\\,\\boldsymbol{G}(\\boldsymbolU)$.\n-   **Numerical Artifact:** The \"carbuncle phenomenon\" occurs near strong, grid-aligned shocks.\n-   **Cause of Artifact:** Insufficient transverse dissipation and excessive alignment of numerical dissipation with the computational grid.\n-   **Evaluation Criteria:** Proposed modifications must be both conservative and effective at reducing the carbuncle.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n-   **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem statement is firmly rooted in the established theory and practice of CFD. The Euler equations, finite volume methods, approximate Riemann solvers, Rankine-Hugoniot conditions, and the carbuncle phenomenon are all standard, well-documented topics in the field.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. It asks for an evaluation of five distinct, clearly described numerical strategies against two concrete criteria (conservation and effectiveness against carbuncle). The answer is determinate based on established knowledge in numerical analysis for hyperbolic conservation laws.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is articulated using precise, objective, and standard terminology from CFD. There are no subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\nThe problem formulation does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. It addresses a real, non-trivial numerical issue in the simulation of high-speed flows.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\n\nThe core of the problem is the \"carbuncle phenomenon,\" a numerical instability that manifests as a spurious, unphysical \"pimple\" or bulge on a captured shock wave that should be smooth. It occurs with certain shock-capturing schemes (notably those based on Roe's approximate Riemann solver) when a strong shock is perfectly aligned with the computational grid. The fundamental cause is a failure of the one-dimensional Riemann solver, applied dimension-by-dimension, to provide adequate dissipation or coupling in the direction transverse to the shock. For a grid-aligned shock, the numerical dissipation is concentrated in the grid-normal direction, leaving the grid-tangential direction susceptible to instabilities, particularly odd-even decoupling.\n\nA numerical scheme is conservative if the update can be written in the telescoping flux-difference form provided in the problem statement. This ensures that the sum of the changes of a conserved quantity over the entire domain is determined solely by the fluxes at the domain boundary, correctly simulating the physical conservation law. For a numerical flux $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{F}}(\\boldsymbol{U}_L, \\boldsymbol{U}_R)$ at an interface, conservatism requires that it is consistent, i.e., $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{F}}(\\boldsymbol{U}, \\boldsymbol{U}) = \\boldsymbol{F}(\\boldsymbol{U})$.\n\nThe task is to evaluate each option against two criteria:\n1.  **Conservation:** Does the method preserve the discrete conservation form?\n2.  **Efficacy:** Is the method a known, effective remedy for the carbuncle phenomenon?\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Replace a Roe-type linearized flux with a two-wave Harten–Lax–van Leer (HLL or HLLE) flux and augment it by a rotated Riemann solver that aligns dissipation with an estimated local shock normal $\\boldsymbol{n}$ computed from $\\nabla p$, thereby increasing transverse dissipation while preserving the flux-difference form.**\n\n-   **Conservation:** HLL-family fluxes are conservative by construction, as they are derived directly from the integral form of the conservation laws, resulting in a consistent numerical flux. A rotated Riemann solver computes the flux at a cell interface by rotating the left and right states into a coordinate system aligned with a local feature (here, the shock normal estimated from $\\nabla p$), solving the $1$D Riemann problem in this rotated frame, and then rotating the resulting flux vector back to the original Cartesian frame. This procedure still yields a single flux vector at the interface, $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{F}}_{i+1/2, j}$, which is a function of the states in the neighboring cells. Thus, the flux-difference form of the finite volume update is maintained, and the method is conservative.\n-   **Efficacy:** This is a classic and effective cure for the carbuncle. The underlying pathology is the one-dimensional nature of the Riemann solver and its grid-aligned dissipation. By rotating the solver to align with the physically relevant direction of the shock normal (approximated by $\\nabla p$), the scheme introduces dissipation in directions oblique to the grid. This provides the necessary dissipation in the transverse direction, damping the instability. The inherent robustness of HLL-type fluxes compared to Roe's solver for strong shocks also contributes to stability.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**B. Add an explicit pressure-smoothing step by introducing a cell-centered artificial pressure diffusion term as a source exclusively in the momentum equations between flux updates, tuned by a shock sensor to damp odd-even decoupling.**\n\n-   **Conservation:** The governing equations are a system: $\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{U}}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathcal{F} = \\boldsymbol{0}$. A conservative discretization maintains this structure. Adding a source term, say $\\boldsymbol{S}$, to the right-hand side of the update, such that $\\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{U}}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathcal{F} = \\boldsymbol{S}$, breaks the conservation form unless $\\boldsymbol{S}$ can itself be written as the divergence of some flux, which is not the case here. Adding a diffusion term *only* to the momentum equations, e.g., $\\boldsymbol{S}_{mom} \\propto \\nabla^2 p$, without corresponding modifications to the energy equation, violates the conservation of total energy. Physical laws are coupled; numerical schemes must respect this coupling to be conservative. This proposed modification is a non-conservative \"fix\".\n-   **Efficacy:** Such pressure-smoothing or artificial viscosity terms are known to be effective at damping the oscillations that characterize the carbuncle. By smoothing the pressure field, it directly counteracts the odd-even decoupling. However, its non-conservative nature is a major drawback.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The method is not conservative, which is a required criterion.\n\n**C. Apply a Total Variation Diminishing (TVD) limiter only in the streamwise direction (parallel to the shock normal), leaving transverse reconstruction unlimited, without changing the numerical flux functions.**\n\n-   **Conservation:** The use of slope limiters is part of the reconstruction step (e.g., in a MUSCL scheme) to determine the states $\\boldsymbol{U}_L$ and $\\boldsymbol{U}_R$ at the cell interface. The numerical flux function $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{F}}(\\boldsymbol{U}_L, \\boldsymbol{U}_R)$ is then evaluated. The overall finite volume scheme remains in the conservative flux-difference form regardless of how the limited-reconstruction is performed, or even if it is omitted in one direction. The method is conservative.\n-   **Efficacy:** This strategy is counter-productive. TVD limiters add numerical dissipation to suppress oscillations, which is why they are used. The carbuncle is caused by a *lack* of dissipation in the transverse direction. By removing the limiter (and thus its associated dissipation) in the transverse direction, one would encourage, not suppress, the growth of oscillations. This would almost certainly exacerbate the carbuncle instability. The correct approach is to *increase* dissipation in the transverse direction.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The method is not effective; it is detrimental.\n\n**D. Augment a Roe-type flux with matrix artificial viscosity constructed from the full eigenstructure to add dissipative terms proportional to the spectral radius in both $x$ and $y$ directions within the numerical fluxes, designed to be entropy-compatible and maintaining conservation through modified interface fluxes.**\n\n-   **Conservation:** Matrix Artificial Viscosity (MAV) is designed to be incorporated directly into the dissipation term of the numerical flux. For a Roe solver, the flux is $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{F}} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\boldsymbol{F}_L + \\boldsymbol{F}_R) - \\frac{1}{2}|\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{A}}|(\\boldsymbol{U}_R - \\boldsymbol{U}_L)$. MAV modifies the dissipation matrix $|\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{A}}|$. As this modification is contained entirely within the numerical flux function $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{F}}$, which remains a consistent function of the left and right states, the resulting finite volume scheme is fully conservative.\n-   **Efficacy:** This is another advanced and effective technique to cure the carbuncle. The failure of the Roe scheme is that for a grid-aligned shock, the dissipation associated with the linearly degenerate contact and shear waves can vanish. MAV addresses this by redesigning the dissipation matrix $|\\boldsymbol{A}|$ to ensure that it remains positive definite and provides sufficient damping for all wave families, especially in the transverse direction. By adding dissipation proportional to the spectral radius (the maximum wave speed) in all directions, it provides a multidimensional source of damping that stabilizes the shock front.\n-   **Verdict:** **Correct**.\n\n**E. Introduce low-Mach preconditioning in shock regions to modify the characteristic speeds and increase numerical dissipation, assuming the same flux-difference form is kept.**\n\n-   **Conservation:** Preconditioning schemes modify the time-derivative term of the PDE system, e.g., $\\boldsymbol{P}^{-1} \\partial_t \\boldsymbol{U} + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathcal{F} = 0$. While conservative discretizations exist for such preconditioned systems, the applicability of the method itself is the key issue.\n-   **Efficacy:** This proposal is physically and numerically nonsensical for this problem. Low-Mach preconditioning is a technique developed specifically for the *low Mach number* regime ($M \\to 0$), where the flow is nearly incompressible. In this regime, the Euler equations become stiff because the acoustic wave speeds are much larger than the flow velocity, leading to severe time-step restrictions and a loss of accuracy. Preconditioning rescales the eigenvalues of the system to alleviate this stiffness. The problem scenario is a *high supersonic Mach number* flow with a *strong shock*. Applying a low-Mach number technique here is a fundamental misapplication of the method. It is not designed for, nor is it effective in, the highly compressible regime of strong shocks. It would corrupt the physics of wave propagation.\n-   **Verdict:** **Incorrect**. The method is entirely inappropriate for the specified physical regime.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, strategies A and D are both conservative and known to be effective cures for the carbuncle phenomenon. They both work by introducing the necessary multi-dimensional or transverse dissipation that is missing in standard grid-aligned, one-dimensional approximate Riemann solvers.",
