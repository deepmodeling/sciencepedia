            "solution": "The problem is to determine the shock formation time and location for the inviscid Burgers' equation with a sinusoidal initial condition. The validation process confirms that the problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nThe governing partial differential equation (PDE) is the inviscid Burgers' equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + u\\,\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0\n$$\nThis equation is the non-conservative form of the conservation law $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial f(u)}{\\partial x} = 0$, where the flux function is $f(u) = \\frac{1}{2}u^2$. The given form is suitable for analysis using the method of characteristics.\n\nThe method of characteristics seeks curves in the $(x,t)$-plane along which the PDE reduces to an ordinary differential equation (ODE). The total derivative of $u(x(t), t)$ along such a curve is:\n$$\n\\frac{d u}{d t} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + \\frac{d x}{d t} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\n$$\nComparing this with the Burgers' equation, we can see that if we define the characteristic curves by the ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{d x}{d t} = u\n$$\nthen along these curves, the value of $u$ is constant:\n$$\n\\frac{d u}{d t} = 0\n$$\nThese two ODEs form the system of characteristic equations. Let us introduce a Lagrangian coordinate $\\xi$, which labels a fluid particle by its initial position at time $t=0$. So, $x(0) = \\xi$.\n\nThe second characteristic equation, $\\frac{d u}{d t} = 0$, implies that $u$ is conserved along a characteristic. This means the value of $u$ for a fluid particle labeled by $\\xi$ is equal to its initial value for all time:\n$$\nu(x(t), t) = u(x(0), 0) = u_0(\\xi)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the first characteristic equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{d x}{d t} = u_0(\\xi)\n$$\nSince $u_0(\\xi)$ is constant for a fixed particle (a fixed $\\xi$), we can integrate this equation with respect to time $t$, using the initial condition $x(0) = \\xi$:\n$$\n\\int_{\\xi}^{x} dx' = \\int_{0}^{t} u_0(\\xi) dt'\n$$\n$$\nx(t, \\xi) - \\xi = u_0(\\xi) t\n$$\nThis gives the equation for the characteristic lines in the $(x,t)$-plane:\n$$\nx = \\xi + u_0(\\xi) t\n$$\nThe solution $u(x,t)$ is implicitly defined by this equation and $u = u_0(\\xi)$. For the given initial condition, $u_0(x) = A\\,\\sin(k x)$, where $A>0$ and $k>0$, the solution is given by the parametric form:\n$$\nu(x,t) = A\\,\\sin(k \\xi)\n$$\n$$\nx = \\xi + (A\\,\\sin(k \\xi)) t\n$$\nThese characteristic lines are straight lines, but their slope in the $(x,t)$-plane, which is $1/u_0(\\xi)$, varies depending on the initial position $\\xi$.\n\nA shock, or a gradient catastrophe, occurs when these characteristic lines first intersect. At the point of intersection, the solution $u(x,t)$ would become multi-valued, which is physically impossible. Mathematically, this corresponds to the moment when the transformation from the Lagrangian coordinate $\\xi$ to the Eulerian coordinate $x$ ceases to be invertible for a fixed time $t$. The invertibility breaks down when the Jacobian of the transformation, $\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial \\xi}$, becomes zero.\nLet us compute this derivative from the characteristic equation $x = \\xi + u_0(\\xi) t$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial \\xi} = 1 + u_0'(\\xi) t\n$$\nwhere $u_0'(\\xi) = \\frac{d u_0}{d \\xi}$. A shock forms when $\\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial \\xi} = 0$, which implies:\n$$\n1 + u_0'(\\xi) t = 0\n$$\nFrom this, we can express the time $t$ at which a shock may form due to the particle initially at $\\xi$:\n$$\nt = -\\frac{1}{u_0'(\\xi)}\n$$\nSince time must be positive ($t>0$), shocks can only form from particles at locations $\\xi$ where $u_0'(\\xi)  0$. The earliest time of shock formation, $t_s$, is the minimum of all such possible positive times:\n$$\nt_s = \\min_{\\xi \\mid u_0'(\\xi)0} \\left( -\\frac{1}{u_0'(\\xi)} \\right)\n$$\nThis is equivalent to finding the most negative value of $u_0'(\\xi)$:\n$$\nt_s = -\\frac{1}{\\min_{\\xi} (u_0'(\\xi))}\n$$\nLet's compute $u_0'(\\xi)$ for the given initial condition $u_0(\\xi) = A\\,\\sin(k \\xi)$:\n$$\nu_0'(\\xi) = \\frac{d}{d\\xi}(A\\,\\sin(k \\xi)) = Ak\\,\\cos(k \\xi)\n$$\nThe minimum value of $\\cos(k \\xi)$ is $-1$. Therefore, the minimum value of $u_0'(\\xi)$ is:\n$$\n\\min_{\\xi} (u_0'(\\xi)) = -Ak\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $t_s$, we find the shock formation time:\n$$\nt_s = -\\frac{1}{-Ak} = \\frac{1}{Ak}\n$$\nNow we must find the spatial location $x_s$ where this first shock forms. The shock first appears at the Lagrangian coordinate(s) $\\xi_s$ where the derivative $u_0'(\\xi)$ is at its minimum. This occurs when:\n$$\nAk\\,\\cos(k \\xi_s) = -Ak \\implies \\cos(k \\xi_s) = -1\n$$\nThis condition is satisfied when $k \\xi_s = (2n+1)\\pi$ for any integer $n$. So, the set of initial particle positions that contribute to the first shock is:\n$$\n\\xi_s = \\frac{(2n+1)\\pi}{k}, \\quad n \\in \\mathbb{Z}\n$$\nThe spatial location $x_s$ is found by substituting $t_s$ and $\\xi_s$ into the characteristic line equation:\n$$\nx_s = \\xi_s + u_0(\\xi_s) t_s\n$$\nFirst, we evaluate $u_0(\\xi_s)$:\n$$\nu_0(\\xi_s) = A\\,\\sin(k \\xi_s) = A\\,\\sin\\left(k \\frac{(2n+1)\\pi}{k}\\right) = A\\,\\sin((2n+1)\\pi) = 0\n$$\nThis indicates that the particles contributing to the first shock are those initially at the zero-crossings of the sine wave where the slope is negative. Since $u_0(\\xi_s)=0$, the characteristic velocity for these particles is zero.\nSubstituting this result into the equation for $x_s$:\n$$\nx_s = \\xi_s + (0) \\cdot t_s = \\xi_s\n$$\nThus, the spatial locations of the first shock are:\n$$\nx_s = \\frac{(2n+1)\\pi}{k}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the location $x_s$ within one fundamental period of length $2\\pi/k$. We can choose the period to be the interval $[0, 2\\pi/k)$. For $n=0$, we get:\n$$\nx_s = \\frac{\\pi}{k}\n$$\nThis location lies within the specified interval $[0, 2\\pi/k)$. For other integer values of $n$, the locations are equivalent modulo $2\\pi/k$. For instance, for $n=1$, $x_s = 3\\pi/k$, which is equivalent to $\\pi/k$ in a periodic domain of period $2\\pi/k$. Thus, the unique location within one fundamental period is $\\pi/k$.\n\nThe earliest time of gradient catastrophe is $t_s = \\frac{1}{Ak}$ and the corresponding location is $x_s = \\frac{\\pi}{k}$.",

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard but rigorous exercise in the theory of hyperbolic conservation laws. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe inviscid Burgers' equation is a scalar conservation law of the form $\\partial_{t} u + \\partial_{x} f(u) = 0$, where $u(x,t)$ is the conserved quantity and $f(u)$ is the flux function. For this problem, the flux is given by $f(u) = \\frac{u^{2}}{2}$.\n\nThe integral form of a conservation law states that for any region $\\Omega$ in the $(x,t)$-plane, the net flux across its boundary $\\partial\\Omega$ is zero. This is derived by integrating the partial differential equation over $\\Omega$ and applying the divergence theorem. For the vector field $\\vec{V} = (f(u), u)$ in the $(x,t)$-plane, the equation is $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{V} = 0$. The integral form is $\\oint_{\\partial\\Omega} (f(u) dt - u dx) = 0$, where the line integral is taken counter-clockwise along the boundary $\\partial\\Omega$.\n\nThe problem specifies the integration domain to be the truncated cone region $K_{T}^{(\\alpha,\\beta)}=\\left\\{(x,t): 0\\le t\\le T,\\ \\alpha\\,t\\le x\\le \\beta\\,t\\right\\}$. This region is a sector of the upper half-plane bounded by the lines $x=\\alpha t$, $x=\\beta t$, and $t=T$. Its boundary, $\\partial K_{T}^{(\\alpha,\\beta)}$, consists of three segments, which we traverse in a counter-clockwise direction:\n1. $C_{\\alpha}$: The line segment from the origin $(0,0)$ to the point $(\\alpha T, T)$, parametrized by $x=\\alpha t$ for $t$ from $0$ to $T$.\n2. $C_{T}$: The horizontal line segment at time $t=T$ from the point $(\\alpha T, T)$ to $(\\beta T, T)$, parametrized by $x$ for $x \\in [\\alpha T, \\beta T]$.\n3. $C_{\\beta}$: The line segment from the point $(\\beta T, T)$ back to the origin $(0,0)$, parametrized by $x=\\beta t$ for $t$ from $T$ to $0$.\n\nThe integral conservation law is thus expressed as the sum of integrals over these three segments:\n$$\n\\oint_{\\partial K_{T}^{(\\alpha,\\beta)}} \\left( f(u) dt - u dx \\right) = \\int_{C_{\\alpha}} \\left( f(u) dt - u dx \\right) + \\int_{C_{T}} \\left( f(u) dt - u dx \\right) + \\int_{C_{\\beta}} \\left( f(u) dt - u dx \\right) = 0.\n$$\nWe evaluate each integral separately, using the assumed piecewise constant solution structure.

The remaining equation is the condition that must hold across the shock:\n$$\nf(u_L) - f(u_R) - s u_L + s u_R = 0.\n$$\nRearranging this gives the Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition:\n$$\ns (u_L - u_R) = f(u_L) - f(u_R).\n$$\nThis relation has been derived from first principles as required, thus verifying the consistency of the piecewise constant shock solution.\n\nThe final step is to solve for the shock speed $s$. Given that $u_L > u_R$, the term $(u_L - u_R)$ is non-zero, so we can divide by it:\n$$\ns = \\frac{f(u_L) - f(u_R)}{u_L - u_R}.\n$$\nSubstituting the specific flux function for the Burgers' equation, $f(u) = \\frac{u^2}{2}$:\n$$\ns = \\frac{\\frac{u_L^2}{2} - \\frac{u_R^2}{2}}{u_L - u_R} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}(u_L^2 - u_R^2)}{u_L - u_R}.\n$$\nFactoring the numerator as a difference of squares, $(u_L^2 - u_R^2) = (u_L - u_R)(u_L + u_R)$:\n$$\ns = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}(u_L - u_R)(u_L + u_R)}{u_L - u_R}.\n$$\nCanceling the non-zero term $(u_L - u_R)$ yields the final expression for the shock speed:\n$$\ns = \\frac{1}{2}(u_L + u_R).\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the shock speed, which is the arithmetic mean of the velocities on the left and right of the discontinuity.",

We separate variables to integrate:\n$$\n\\frac{dU}{(U - u_L)(U - u_R)} = \\frac{1}{2\\nu} d\\xi\n$$\nWe use partial fraction decomposition for the left-hand side:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{(U - u_L)(U - u_R)} = \\frac{1}{u_L - u_R}\\left(\\frac{1}{U - u_L} - \\frac{1}{U - u_R}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this back and integrating both sides:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{u_L - u_R} \\int \\left(\\frac{1}{U - u_L} - \\frac{1}{U - u_R}\\right) dU = \\int \\frac{1}{2\\nu} d\\xi\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{u_L - u_R} \\left( \\ln|U - u_L| - \\ln|U - u_R| \\right) = \\frac{\\xi}{2\\nu} + C_2\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left|\\frac{U - u_L}{U - u_R}\\right| = \\frac{u_L - u_R}{2\\nu}\\xi + C_3\n$$\nwhere $C_3 = (u_L - u_R)C_2$ is a new integration constant. The solution profile is monotone from $u_L$ to $u_R$, with $u_L > u_R$. Thus, for any finite $\\xi$, we have $u_R  U(\\xi)  u_L$. This implies $U - u_L  0$ and $U - u_R > 0$. Therefore, the argument of the absolute value is negative, and we have:\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{U - u_L}{U - u_R}\\right| = -\\frac{U - u_L}{U - u_R} = \\frac{u_L - U}{U - u_R}\n$$\nThe equation becomes:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{u_L - U}{U - u_R}\\right) = \\frac{u_L - u_R}{2\\nu}\\xi + C_3\n$$\nTo determine $C_3$, we apply the centering condition $U(0) = \\frac{1}{2}(u_L + u_R)$. Substituting $\\xi=0$:\n$$\n\\frac{u_L - U(0)}{U(0) - u_R} = \\frac{u_L - \\frac{1}{2}(u_L + u_R)}{\\frac{1}{2}(u_L + u_R) - u_R} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}(u_L - u_R)}{\\frac{1}{2}(u_L - u_R)} = 1\n$$\nPlugging this into the logarithmic equation at $\\xi=0$:\n$$\n\\ln(1) = 0 + C_3 \\quad \\implies \\quad C_3 = 0\n$$\nThe implicit solution is thus:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{u_L - U}{U - u_R}\\right) = \\frac{u_L - u_R}{2\\nu}\\xi\n$$\nTo find the explicit form, we exponentiate both sides:\n$$\n\\frac{u_L - U}{U - u_R} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{u_L - u_R}{2\\nu}\\xi\\right)\n$$\nNow, we solve for $U(\\xi)$:\n$$\nu_L - U = (U - u_R) \\exp\\left(\\frac{u_L - u_R}{2\\nu}\\xi\\right)\n$$\n$$\nu_L + u_R \\exp\\left(\\frac{u_L - u_R}{2\\nu}\\xi\\right) = U \\left(1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{u_L - u_R}{2\\nu}\\xi\\right)\\right)\n$$\n$$\nU(\\xi) = \\frac{u_L + u_R \\exp\\left(\\frac{u_L - u_R}{2\\nu}\\xi\\right)}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{u_L - u_R}{2\\nu}\\xi\\right)}\n$$\nThis expression can be written more compactly using the hyperbolic tangent function. Let $\\bar{u} = \\frac{u_L+u_R}{2}$ and $\\Delta u = \\frac{u_L-u_R}{2}$, so that $u_L = \\bar{u}+\\Delta u$ and $u_R = \\bar{u}-\\Delta u$. The argument of the exponential is $\\frac{2\\Delta u}{2\\nu}\\xi = \\frac{\\Delta u}{\\nu}\\xi$.\n$$\nU(\\xi) = \\frac{(\\bar{u}+\\Delta u) + (\\bar{u}-\\Delta u)\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta u}{\\nu}\\xi\\right)}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta u}{\\nu}\\xi\\right)} = \\frac{\\bar{u}\\left(1+\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta u}{\\nu}\\xi\\right)\\right) + \\Delta u\\left(1-\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta u}{\\nu}\\xi\\right)\\right)}{1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta u}{\\nu}\\xi\\right)}\n$$\n$$\nU(\\xi) = \\bar{u} + \\Delta u \\frac{1-\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta u}{\\nu}\\xi\\right)}{1+\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta u}{\\nu}\\xi\\right)}\n$$\nUsing the identity $\\tanh(z) = \\frac{\\exp(2z)-1}{\\exp(2z)+1}$, which implies $-\\tanh(z) = \\frac{1-\\exp(2z)}{1+\\exp(2z)}$, and setting $2z = \\frac{\\Delta u}{\\nu}\\xi$, we get $z=\\frac{\\Delta u}{2\\nu}\\xi$.\n$$\nU(\\xi) = \\bar{u} - \\Delta u \\tanh\\left(\\frac{\\Delta u}{2\\nu}\\xi\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting back the expressions for $\\bar{u}$ and $\\Delta u$:\n$$\nU(\\xi) = \\frac{u_L+u_R}{2} - \\frac{u_L-u_R}{2} \\tanh\\left(\\frac{(u_L-u_R)\\xi}{4\\nu}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form analytic expression for the viscous shock profile.",
