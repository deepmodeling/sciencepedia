            "solution": "This problem requires the determination of the base dimensions of dynamic viscosity $\\mu$, thermal conductivity $k$, and mass diffusivity $D$ using fundamental definitions and constitutive relations, followed by a verification of dimensional consistency for terms in the governing conservation equations of fluid dynamics. The fundamental dimensions are mass ($M$), length ($L$), time ($T$), and temperature ($\\Theta$).\n\nPart 1: Dimensional Analysis of Dynamic Viscosity ($\\mu$)\n\nThe analysis begins with the definition of stress, $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$, as force per unit area. The dimension of force, $[F]$, is derived from Newton's second law ($F=ma$) as $[M][L][T]^{-2}$. The dimension of area, $[A]$, is $[L]^2$.\nTherefore, the dimension of stress is:\n$$[\\boldsymbol{\\tau}] = \\frac{[F]}{[A]} = \\frac{[M][L][T]^{-2}}{[L]^2} = [M][L]^{-1}[T]^{-2}$$\nThe problem states that for a Newtonian fluid, the viscous stress is proportional to the rate-of-strain. A simple representation of this constitutive relation is given by Newton's law of viscosity, for example in a simple shear flow, $\\tau_{yx} = \\mu (\\partial u_x / \\partial y)$, where $\\tau_{yx}$ is the shear stress, and $\\partial u_x / \\partial y$ is the velocity gradient, which represents the rate of strain.\nThe dimension of velocity, $[u]$, is $[L][T]^{-1}$. The dimension of a spatial coordinate, $[y]$, is $[L]$. Thus, the dimension of the rate-of-strain is:\n$$\\left[\\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial y}\\right] = \\frac{[u_x]}{[y]} = \\frac{[L][T]^{-1}}{[L]} = [T]^{-1}$$\nFrom the constitutive relation, the dimensions must be consistent: $[\\boldsymbol{\\tau}] = [\\mu] [\\text{rate-of-strain}]$. We can therefore solve for the dimension of dynamic viscosity, $[\\mu]$:\n$$[\\mu] = \\frac{[\\boldsymbol{\\tau}]}{[\\text{rate-of-strain}]} = \\frac{[M][L]^{-1}[T]^{-2}}{[T]^{-1}} = [M][L]^{-1}[T]^{-1}$$\nSo, the base-dimensional form of $\\mu$ is $M L^{-1} T^{-1}$.\n\nPart 2: Dimensional Analysis of Thermal Conductivity ($k$)\n\nHeat flux, $\\boldsymbol{q}$, is defined as energy transfer per unit area per unit time. The dimension of energy, $[E]$, is force times distance, so $[E] = [F][L] = ([M][L][T]^{-2})[L] = [M][L]^2[T]^{-2}$.\nThe dimension of heat flux is then:\n$$[\\boldsymbol{q}] = \\frac{[E]}{[A][T]} = \\frac{[M][L]^2[T]^{-2}}{[L]^2[T]} = [M][T]^{-3}$$\nThe linear constitutive relation for heat conduction is Fourier's Law, which states that heat flux is proportional to the temperature gradient: $\\boldsymbol{q} = -k \\nabla T$.\nThe dimension of temperature is $[\\Theta]$. The dimension of the gradient operator, $[\\nabla]$, is $[L]^{-1}$. Therefore, the dimension of the temperature gradient is:\n$$[\\nabla T] = \\frac{[\\Theta]}{[L]} = [\\Theta][L]^{-1}$$\nFrom Fourier's Law, the dimensions must be consistent: $[\\boldsymbol{q}] = [k][\\nabla T]$. We solve for the dimension of thermal conductivity, $[k]$:\n$$[k] = \\frac{[\\boldsymbol{q}]}{[\\nabla T]} = \\frac{[M][T]^{-3}}{[\\Theta][L]^{-1}} = [M][L][T]^{-3}[\\Theta]^{-1}$$\nSo, the base-dimensional form of $k$ is $M L T^{-3} \\Theta^{-1}$.\n\nPart 3: Dimensional Analysis of Mass Diffusivity ($D$)\n\nSpecies mass flux, $\\boldsymbol{j}$, is defined as the mass of a species passing through a unit area per unit time.\nThe dimension of mass flux is:\n$$[\\boldsymbol{j}] = \\frac{[M]}{[A][T]} = \\frac{[M]}{[L]^2[T]} = [M][L]^{-2}[T]^{-1}$$\nThe linear constitutive relation for mass diffusion is Fick's First Law. The problem alludes to a relationship between mass flux, $\\boldsymbol{j}$, the gradient of a dimensionless composition variable, $Y$ (mass fraction), and the mass diffusivity, $D$. This relationship is commonly expressed as $\\boldsymbol{j} = -\\rho D \\nabla Y$, where $\\rho$ is the total mass density.\nThe dimension of density, $[\\rho]$, is $[M][L]^{-3}$. The mass fraction, $Y$, is dimensionless, so $[Y]=[1]$. The dimension of its gradient is $[\\nabla Y] = [L]^{-1}$.\nFrom this form of Fick's law, we have the dimensional relation $[\\boldsymbol{j}] = [\\rho][D][\\nabla Y]$. We solve for the dimension of mass diffusivity, $[D]$:\n$$[D] = \\frac{[\\boldsymbol{j}]}{[\\rho][\\nabla Y]} = \\frac{[M][L]^{-2}[T]^{-1}}{([M][L]^{-3})([L]^{-1})} = \\frac{[M][L]^{-2}[T]^{-1}}{[M][L]^{-4}} = [L]^2[T]^{-1}$$\nSo, the base-dimensional form of $D$ is $L^2 T^{-1}$.\n\nVerification of Dimensional Consistency:\n\nMomentum Equation: Compare $\\rho\\, D\\boldsymbol{u}/Dt$ and $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\tau}$.\nThe term $D\\boldsymbol{u}/Dt$ represents acceleration, so its dimension is $[L][T]^{-2}$.\nDimension of the inertial term: $[\\rho\\, D\\boldsymbol{u}/Dt] = [\\rho] [D\\boldsymbol{u}/Dt] = ([M][L]^{-3})([L][T]^{-2}) = [M][L]^{-2}[T]^{-2}$.\nDimension of the viscous term: $[\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\tau}] = [\\nabla] [\\boldsymbol{\\tau}] = ([L]^{-1})([M][L]^{-1}[T]^{-2}) = [M][L]^{-2}[T]^{-2]$.\nThe dimensions match, representing force per unit volume.\n\nEnergy Equation: Compare $\\rho\\, c_{p}\\, DT/Dt$ and $\\nabla \\cdot (k\\, \\nabla T)$.\nFirst, we find the dimension of specific heat at constant pressure, $c_p$. From $dQ = m c_p dT$, $c_p$ is energy per mass per temperature. So, $[c_p] = [E]/([M][\\Theta]) = ([M][L]^2[T]^{-2})/([M][\\Theta]) = [L]^2[T]^{-2}[\\Theta]^{-1}$. The term $DT/Dt$ has dimension $[\\Theta][T]^{-1}$.\nDimension of the storage term: $[\\rho c_p DT/Dt] = [\\rho][c_p][DT/Dt] = ([M][L]^{-3})([L]^2[T]^{-2}[\\Theta]^{-1})([\\Theta][T]^{-1}) = [M][L]^{-1}[T]^{-3}$.\nDimension of the conduction term: $[\\nabla \\cdot (k \\nabla T)] = [\\nabla][k][\\nabla T] = ([L]^{-1})([M][L][T]^{-3}[\\Theta]^{-1})([\\Theta][L]^{-1}) = [M][L]^{-1}[T]^{-3}$.\nThe dimensions match, representing energy per unit volume per unit time.\n\nSpecies Equation: Compare $\\partial(\\rho Y)/\\partial t$ and $\\nabla \\cdot (\\rho\\, D\\, \\nabla Y)$.\nThe term $\\rho Y$ is a species concentration (mass of species per unit volume).\nDimension of the storage term: $[\\partial(\\rho Y)/\\partial t] = [\\rho Y]/[T] = ([M][L]^{-3})/([T]) = [M][L]^{-3}[T]^{-1}$.\nDimension of the diffusion term: $[\\nabla \\cdot (\\rho D \\nabla Y)] = [\\nabla][\\rho][D][\\nabla Y] = ([L]^{-1})([M][L]^{-3})([L]^2[T]^{-1})([L]^{-1}) = [M][L]^{-3}[T]^{-1}$.\nThe dimensions match, representing mass of species per unit volume per unit time.\n\nThe successful verification of dimensional consistency in all three conservation equations confirms the correctness of the derived dimensions for $\\mu$, $k$, and $D$. The final answer is the set of these derived base-dimensional forms.",

This quantity is mathematically defined as the logarithmic derivative of the function with respect to the logarithm of the independent variable.

            "solution": "### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the first-order velocity-slip boundary condition at a solid wall. This relation, first proposed by Maxwell, connects the slip velocity of the gas to the velocity gradient at the wall. The derivation is based on an analysis of tangential momentum exchange between the gas and the solid surface from the perspective of kinetic theory.\n\nLet the solid wall be located at the plane $n=0$, where $n$ is the coordinate normal to the wall, pointing into the gas. The gas flows tangentially, with a velocity profile $u_t(n)$. Due to the rarefaction effects typical of the slip-flow regime, the gas layer immediately adjacent to the wall does not adhere to it but instead moves with a finite tangential velocity, $u_{\\mathrm{slip}} = u_t(n=0)$.\n\nThe slip velocity $u_{\\mathrm{slip}}$ is the macroscopic manifestation of the molecular interactions at the gas-solid interface. It can be found by considering the average tangential velocity of gas molecules at the wall plane, $n=0$. This average is composed of two populations of molecules: those incident upon the wall from the gas, and those departing from the wall. Assuming equal number fluxes for incident and departing molecules, the slip velocity is their arithmetic mean:\n$$\nu_{\\mathrm{slip}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\text{avg. incident tangential velocity}\\right) + \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\text{avg. departing tangential velocity}\\right)\n$$\nLet us denote the average incident tangential velocity as $\\langle v_{t, \\text{inc}} \\rangle$ and the average departing tangential velocity as $\\langle v_{t, \\text{dept}} \\rangle$.\n$$\nu_{\\mathrm{slip}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\langle v_{t, \\text{inc}} \\rangle + \\langle v_{t, \\text{dept}} \\rangle \\right)\n$$\nA key insight from kinetic theory is that molecules incident on the wall carry the average momentum of the layer where they last experienced a collision. For a leading-order analysis, this location is, on average, at a distance of one mean free path, $\\lambda$, from the wall. The macroscopic gas velocity at this distance, $u_t(n=\\lambda)$, can be approximated by a first-order Taylor series expansion about the wall:\n$$\nu_t(\\lambda) \\approx u_t(0) + \\lambda \\left.\\frac{\\partial u_t}{\\partial n}\\right|_{n=0} = u_{\\mathrm{slip}} + \\lambda \\left.\\frac{\\partial u_t}{\\partial n}\\right|_{w}\n$$\nTherefore, we set $\\langle v_{t, \\text{inc}} \\rangle = u_t(\\lambda) \\approx u_{\\mathrm{slip}} + \\lambda \\left.\\frac{\\partial u_t}{\\partial n}\\right|_{w}$.\n\nNext, we model the velocity of molecules departing the wall. A fraction $\\sigma$ (the TMAC) of the molecules are assumed to accommodate fully with the wall and are re-emitted diffusely. Since the wall is stationary and at the same temperature as the gas, these diffusely reflected molecules are emitted with zero average tangential velocity. The remaining fraction, $1-\\sigma$, is assumed to undergo specular reflection, meaning they retain their original tangential velocity.\nThus, the average tangential velocity of departing molecules is a weighted average:\n$$\n\\langle v_{t, \\text{dept}} \\rangle = \\sigma \\cdot (0) + (1-\\sigma) \\cdot \\langle v_{t, \\text{inc}} \\rangle = (1-\\sigma) \\left( u_{\\mathrm{slip}} + \\lambda \\left.\\frac{\\partial u_t}{\\partial n}\\right|_{w} \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\langle v_{t, \\text{inc}} \\rangle$ and $\\langle v_{t, \\text{dept}} \\rangle$ into the equation for $u_{\\mathrm{slip}}$:\n$$\nu_{\\mathrm{slip}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\left( u_{\\mathrm{slip}} + \\lambda \\left.\\frac{\\partial u_t}{\\partial n}\\right|_{w} \\right) + (1-\\sigma) \\left( u_{\\mathrm{slip}} + \\lambda \\left.\\frac{\\partial u_t}{\\partial n}\\right|_{w} \\right) \\right]\n$$\nFactoring out the common term:\n$$\nu_{\\mathrm{slip}} = \\frac{1}{2} (1 + (1-\\sigma)) \\left( u_{\\mathrm{slip}} + \\lambda \\left.\\frac{\\partial u_t}{\\partial n}\\right|_{w} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nu_{\\mathrm{slip}} = \\frac{2-\\sigma}{2} \\left( u_{\\mathrm{slip}} + \\lambda \\left.\\frac{\\partial u_t}{\\partial n}\\right|_{w} \\right)\n$$\nWe now solve for $u_{\\mathrm{slip}}$:\n$$\n2 u_{\\mathrm{slip}} = (2-\\sigma) u_{\\mathrm{slip}} + (2-\\sigma) \\lambda \\left.\\frac{\\partial u_t}{\\partial n}\\right|_{w}\n$$\n$$\n2 u_{\\mathrm{slip}} - (2-\\sigma) u_{\\mathrm{slip}} = (2-\\sigma) \\lambda \\left.\\frac{\\partial u_t}{\\partial n}\\right|_{w}\n$$\n$$\n(2 - 2 + \\sigma) u_{\\mathrm{slip}} = (2-\\sigma) \\lambda \\left.\\frac{\\partial u_t}{\\partial n}\\right|_{w}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma u_{\\mathrm{slip}} = (2-\\sigma) \\lambda \\left.\\frac{\\partial u_t}{\\partial n}\\right|_{w}\n$$\nThis gives the desired leading-order relation for the slip velocity:\n$$\nu_{\\mathrm{slip}} = \\frac{2-\\sigma}{\\sigma} \\lambda \\left.\\frac{\\partial u_t}{\\partial n}\\right|_{w}\n$$\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\n\nWe are asked to evaluate the magnitude of the slip velocity, $|u_{\\mathrm{slip}}|$, for the given parameters.
