In a steady flow, where the velocity at a fixed point in space does not change over time, it might seem that a particle cannot accelerate. This exercise  demonstrates the crucial concept of convective acceleration, showing that a particle accelerates by moving from a region of lower velocity to a region of higher velocity. Calculating the material derivative provides a direct measure of this total acceleration and is a foundational skill in fluid dynamics.",

            "problem": "You are given a one-dimensional, time-dependent velocity field representing a smoothed, translating shock wave. The field is specified by the function $$v(x,t) = u_R + \\frac{u_L - u_R}{2}\\left(1 - \\tanh\\left(\\frac{x - x_s(t)}{\\epsilon}\\right)\\right)$$ with the shock position $$x_s(t) = x_{s0} + s\\,t$$ where $x$ is position in meters, $t$ is time in seconds, $u_L$ is the upstream velocity in meters per second, $u_R$ is the downstream velocity in meters per second, $s$ is the shock speed in meters per second, $\\epsilon$ is the shock thickness in meters, and $x_{s0}$ is the initial shock position in meters. This profile transitions smoothly from $u_L$ upstream to $u_R$ downstream across a thickness of order $\\epsilon$ and propagates at speed $s$.\n\nYour task is to numerically generate and compare the Lagrangian pathline and an Eulerian frozen-field streamline-based trajectory originating from the same seed position at an initial time.

In steady flows this trajectory coincides with the streamline-based prediction.\n\nYou must compute the discrepancy at a specified final time $t_1$ given by the absolute separation $$D = \\left|x_{\\mathrm{p}}(t_1) - x_{\\mathrm{f}}(t_1)\\right|.$$ The numerical integration must use a deterministic, explicit fourth-order Runge–Kutta (RK) method with a fixed time step chosen based on a physically motivated criterion to adequately resolve shock motion and steep gradients. All distances must be reported in meters.\n\nImplement the following for each test case:\n1. Define the velocity field parameters $u_L$, $u_R$, $s$, $\\epsilon$, $x_{s0}$, and initial–final times $t_0$, $t_1$, and the seed position $x_0$.\n2.

            "solution": "The core distinction between the Eulerian and Lagrangian descriptions of flow arises from the way one accounts for time dependence in the velocity field. In the Lagrangian description, a material point moves with the local velocity, which mathematically is encoded by the ordinary differential equation $$\\frac{dx}{dt} = v(x,t),$$ subject to an initial condition $x(t_0) = x_0$. This equation is a statement of kinematics: the velocity $v$ is the time derivative of the particle position. In the Eulerian description, one focuses on the velocity field at fixed times, and a streamline is the curve that is everywhere tangent to the instantaneous velocity field. In two or more spatial dimensions, the streamline at time $t_0$ satisfies a spatial differential equation with respect to an arclength parameter, but in one dimension the streamline degenerates to a trivial notion. To compare with a trajectory, a common Eulerian proxy is the frozen-field assumption, where one advances the particle using the velocity field held fixed at $t_0$, resulting in the ordinary differential equation $$\\frac{dx}{dt} = v(x,t_0), \\quad x(t_0) = x_0.$$\n\nIn unsteady flows, especially those with waves or shocks, the frozen-field trajectory generally deviates from the true pathline because the material derivative introduces contributions from explicit time dependence. The material derivative of the velocity is given by $$\\frac{D v}{D t} = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} + v \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x},$$ and when $\\partial v / \\partial t \\neq 0$ due to a moving shock, the pathline incorporates the wave propagation dynamics, whereas the frozen-field trajectory does not. In the present setup, the one-dimensional velocity field is specified by $$v(x,t) = u_R + \\frac{u_L - u_R}{2}\\left(1 - \\tanh\\left(\\frac{x - x_s(t)}{\\epsilon}\\right)\\right), \\quad x_s(t) = x_{s0} + s\\,t.$$ This is a smooth traveling wave that transitions from $u_L$ to $u_R$ across a thickness of order $\\epsilon$ and translates at speed $s$. When $s \\neq 0$, the explicit time dependence is large where the gradient is steep, that is near $x \\approx x_s(t)$, and discrepancies between the Lagrangian pathline and the frozen-field trajectory are expected to be significant.\n\nAlgorithmic design follows from these principles. For each test case, we compute two trajectories starting at $x(t_0) = x_0$:\n- The Lagrangian pathline $x_{\\mathrm{p}}(t)$ by numerically integrating $$\\frac{dx}{dt} = f_{\\mathrm{p}}(x,t) := v(x,t),$$\n- The Eulerian frozen-field trajectory $x_{\\mathrm{f}}(t)$ by numerically integrating $$\\frac{dx}{dt} = f_{\\mathrm{f}}(x,t) := v(x,t_0),$$ which is a non-autonomous equation reduced to an autonomous one because the right-hand side is time-independent.\n\nA robust, explicit integrator is the classical fourth-order Runge–Kutta method (Runge–Kutta (RK)), which advances the solution from $t$ to $t+\\Delta t$ by computing staged slopes $$\\begin{aligned} \nk_1 &= f(x,t),\\\\\nk_2 &= f\\!\\left(x + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}k_1,\\, t + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}\\right),\\\\\nk_3 &= f\\!\\left(x + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}k_2,\\, t + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}\\right),\\\\\nk_4 &= f\\!\\left(x + \\Delta t\\,k_3,\\, t + \\Delta t\\right),\n\\end{aligned}$$ and updating $$x \\leftarrow x + \\frac{\\Delta t}{6}\\left(k_1 + 2 k_2 + 2 k_3 + k_4\\right).$$ For the frozen-field trajectory $f_{\\mathrm{f}}$ there is no explicit time dependence, so $k_2$, $k_3$, and $k_4$ evaluate $f$ at the same fixed time-level field $v(\\cdot,t_0)$.\n\nTo ensure resolution of steep gradients near the shock, the time step $\\Delta t$ should be chosen consistent with a Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) type criterion that limits the spatial advance per step relative to the shock thickness. A simple deterministic choice is $$\\Delta t = \\min\\left(\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{base}},\\, C \\frac{\\epsilon}{U_{\\max}}\\right),$$ where $\\Delta t_{\\mathrm{base}}$ is a small baseline step, $C$ is a safety coefficient, and $U_{\\max}$ is a bound on characteristic speeds, which can be taken as $$U_{\\max} = \\max\\left(\\left|u_L\\right|,\\,\\left|u_R\\right|,\\,\\left|s\\right|\\right).$$ This selection ensures that the particle does not cross a significant fraction of the shock thickness in one step, thus controlling local truncation error and enabling accurate capture of the shock-induced time dependence. We use a fixed $\\Delta t$ for each case to maintain determinism.\n\nFor each test case, we integrate from $t=t_0$ to $t=t_1$ using the above RK scheme for both $x_{\\mathrm{p}}(t)$ and $x_{\\mathrm{f}}(t)$ and compute the discrepancy $$D = \\left|x_{\\mathrm{p}}(t_1) - x_{\\mathrm{f}}(t_1)\\right|.$$ The output is a list $\\left[D_1, D_2, D_3, D_4, D_5\\right]$ in meters. Interpretation of the discrepancies is grounded in wave propagation: when $s \\neq 0$ and $\\epsilon$ is small, the velocity field changes rapidly near $x_s(t)$, causing $\\partial v/\\partial t$ to be significant and the Lagrangian pathline to differ substantially from a trajectory generated by freezing the field at $t_0$. Conversely, a stationary shock with $s=0$ reduces explicit time dependence, which should yield much smaller discrepancies. Seeds placed far downstream of the shock transition also experience weaker gradients and correspondingly smaller differences.\n\nThe provided test suite explores these facets:\n- Case $1$ is a \"happy path\" with a moderate thickness $\\epsilon$ and a right-moving shock, with the seed upstream; discrepancy is expected to be noticeable.\n- Case $2$ tightens the shock thickness $\\epsilon$, increasing gradients and amplifying the discrepancy.\n- Case $3$ places the seed downstream, where gradients are weaker and discrepancy should be smaller relative to upstream placement.\n- Case $4$ sets a stationary shock with $s=0$, acting as a boundary case where the frozen-field and Lagrangian evolutions should be closer.\n- Case $5$ considers a left-moving shock ($s<0$) with different upstream and downstream speeds, acting as an edge case testing the sign of shock propagation and sensitivity near the shock.\n\nAll computed values are distances expressed in meters, as required. The final program deterministically integrates these cases and prints a single line in the prescribed format.",
