This exercise provides a foundational link between the components of the strain-rate tensor and the physical forces experienced by a fluid element.",

There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is derived as follows.\n\nThe velocity vector is given by $\\mathbf{u} = u_1\\mathbf{e}_x + u_2\\mathbf{e}_y + u_3\\mathbf{e}_z$, where $u_1 = \\gamma y$, $u_2 = 0$, and $u_3 = 0$. The coordinates are $(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (x, y, z)$.\n\nFirst, we compute the velocity gradient tensor, $\\nabla \\mathbf{u}$, whose components are $(\\nabla \\mathbf{u})_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial u_i}{\\partial x_j}$.\n$$\n(\\nabla \\mathbf{u})_{11} = \\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial x} = 0\n\\quad\n(\\nabla \\mathbf{u})_{12} = \\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial y} = \\gamma\n\\quad\n(\\nabla \\mathbf{u})_{13} = \\frac{\\partial u_1}{\\partial z} = 0\n$$\nAll other components of the velocity gradient tensor are zero since $u_2$ and $u_3$ are zero.\n$$\n(\\nabla \\mathbf{u})_{2j} = \\frac{\\partial u_2}{\\partial x_j} = 0\n\\quad\n(\\nabla \\mathbf{u})_{3j} = \\frac{\\partial u_3}{\\partial x_j} = 0\n$$\nThus, the velocity gradient tensor is:\n$$\n\\nabla \\mathbf{u} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\gamma & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we find the strain-rate tensor, $\\mathbf{S}$, which is the symmetric part of the velocity gradient: $\\mathbf{S} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\nabla \\mathbf{u} + (\\nabla \\mathbf{u})^T \\right]$. The transpose of the velocity gradient is:\n$$\n(\\nabla \\mathbf{u})^T = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\gamma & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nTherefore, the strain-rate tensor is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{S} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\gamma & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\gamma & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\gamma & 0 \\\\ \\gamma & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe trace of the strain-rate tensor is $\\text{tr}(\\mathbf{S}) = \\frac{1}{2}(0+0+0) = 0$, which is consistent with the condition for an incompressible flow, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = 0$.\n\nFor a Newtonian fluid, the Cauchy stress tensor $\\sigma$ is related to the pressure $p$ and the strain-rate tensor $\\mathbf{S}$ by the constitutive relation $\\sigma = -p\\mathbf{I} + \\tau$, where $\\mathbf{I}$ is the identity tensor and $\\tau$ is the deviatoric stress tensor. For an incompressible fluid, the deviatoric stress tensor is given by $\\tau = 2\\mu\\mathbf{S}$.\nSubstituting the expression for $\\mathbf{S}$:\n$$\n\\tau = 2\\mu \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\gamma & 0 \\\\ \\gamma & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\mu \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\gamma & 0 \\\\ \\gamma & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe Cauchy stress tensor is then:\n$$\n\\sigma = -p \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} + \\mu \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & \\gamma & 0 \\\\ \\gamma & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -p & \\mu\\gamma & 0 \\\\ \\mu\\gamma & -p & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -p \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nTo find the principal stresses and directions within the $\\{x,y\\}$-plane, we analyze the $2 \\times 2$ submatrix corresponding to the $x$ and $y$ components of $\\sigma$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xy} = \\begin{pmatrix} -p & \\mu\\gamma \\\\ \\mu\\gamma & -p \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe principal stresses are the eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of this matrix, which are found by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(\\sigma_{xy} - \\lambda \\mathbf{I}) = 0$.\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} -p - \\lambda & \\mu\\gamma \\\\ \\mu\\gamma & -p - \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0\n$$\n$$\n(-p - \\lambda)^2 - (\\mu\\gamma)^2 = 0\n$$\n$$\n(p + \\lambda)^2 = (\\mu\\gamma)^2\n$$\n$$\np + \\lambda = \\pm \\mu\\gamma\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda = -p \\pm \\mu\\gamma\n$$\nThe two principal stresses are $\\sigma_1 = -p + \\mu\\gamma$ and $\\sigma_2 = -p - \\mu\\gamma$. Since $\\mu>0$ and $\\gamma>0$, $\\sigma_1$ is the algebraically largest principal stress.\n\nThe principal directions are the eigenvectors associated with these eigenvalues. Let an eigenvector be $\\mathbf{v} = (v_x, v_y)^T$. We solve $(\\sigma_{xy} - \\lambda \\mathbf{I})\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{0}$.\n\nFor the first principal stress, $\\sigma_1 = -p + \\mu\\gamma$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} -p - (-p + \\mu\\gamma) & \\mu\\gamma \\\\ \\mu\\gamma & -p - (-p + \\mu\\gamma) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_x \\\\ v_y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} -\\mu\\gamma & \\mu\\gamma \\\\ \\mu\\gamma & -\\mu\\gamma \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_x \\\\ v_y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis yields the equation $-\\mu\\gamma v_x + \\mu\\gamma v_y = 0$, which simplifies to $v_x = v_y$. The eigenvector is any non-zero vector proportional to $(1,1)^T$. The direction is given by the angle $\\theta_1 = \\arctan(v_y/v_x) = \\arctan(1)$. In radians, this is $\\theta_1 = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$. This is a direction of principal tension (or minimal compression).\n\nFor the second principal stress, $\\sigma_2 = -p - \\mu\\gamma$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} -p - (-p - \\mu\\gamma) & \\mu\\gamma \\\\ \\mu\\gamma & -p - (-p - \\mu\\gamma) \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_x \\\\ v_y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\mu\\gamma & \\mu\\gamma \\\\ \\mu\\gamma & \\mu\\gamma \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_x \\\\ v_y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis yields the equation $\\mu\\gamma v_x + \\mu\\gamma v_y = 0$, which simplifies to $v_x = -v_y$. The eigenvector is any non-zero vector proportional to $(1,-1)^T$. The direction is given by the angle $\\theta_2 = \\arctan(v_y/v_x) = \\arctan(-1)$. In radians, this is $\\theta_2 = -\\frac{\\pi}{4}$. This is a direction of principal compression. The two principal directions are, as expected for a symmetric tensor, orthogonal.\n\nThe final answer requires the two angles followed by their corresponding principal stresses.\nAngle 1: $\\theta_1 = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ radians, corresponding principal stress: $\\sigma_1 = -p + \\mu\\gamma$ Pascals.\nAngle 2: $\\theta_2 = -\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ radians, corresponding principal stress: $\\sigma_2 = -p - \\mu\\gamma$ Pascals.\nThe ordered list is ($\\theta_1$, $\\theta_2$, $\\sigma_1$, $\\sigma_2$).",

First, we find the transpose of $\\nabla \\boldsymbol{u}$:\n$$\n(\\nabla \\boldsymbol{u})^T = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & \\Omega + k & m \\\\\n-\\Omega + k & 0 & 0 \\\\\nm & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow we compute $S$:\n$$\nS = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -\\Omega + k & m \\\\\n\\Omega + k & 0 & 0 \\\\\nm & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix} + \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & \\Omega + k & m \\\\\n-\\Omega + k & 0 & 0 \\\\\nm & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 2k & 2m \\\\\n2k & 0 & 0 \\\\\n2m & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nS = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & k & m \\\\\nk & 0 & 0 \\\\\nm & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe rotation-rate tensor is defined as $W = \\frac{1}{2}(\\nabla \\boldsymbol{u} - (\\nabla \\boldsymbol{u})^T)$:\n$$\nW = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -\\Omega + k & m \\\\\n\\Omega + k & 0 & 0 \\\\\nm & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & \\Omega + k & m \\\\\n-\\Omega + k & 0 & 0 \\\\\nm & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -2\\Omega & 0 \\\\\n2\\Omega & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nW = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & -\\Omega & 0 \\\\\n\\Omega & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\n**2. Shear and Rotation Features**\n\nThe strain-rate tensor $S$ describes the deformation of a fluid element. Its diagonal components, $S_{ii}$, represent the rate of extensional strain, while its off-diagonal components, $S_{ij}$ ($i \\ne j$), represent half the rate of shear strain.\n- The diagonal components are all zero: $S_{xx} = S_{yy} = S_{zz} = 0$. This indicates that there is no linear extension or compression of fluid elements along the coordinate axes.\n- The off-diagonal components are $S_{xy} = S_{yx} = k$ and $S_{xz} = S_{zx} = m$. These non-zero components signify rates of shearing. Specifically, $k$ corresponds to shear in the $x-y$ plane, and $m$ corresponds to shear in the $x-z$ plane. There is no shear in the $y-z$ plane as $S_{yz} = S_{zy} = 0$.\n\nThe rotation-rate tensor $W$ describes the local angular velocity of a fluid element. It is related to the vorticity vector $\\boldsymbol{\\omega} = \\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{u}$. The components of the vorticity vector can be found from $W$ via $\\omega_i = -2\\epsilon_{ijk} W_{jk}$ (sum over $j, k$). More directly, $\\omega_x = 2W_{zy}$, $\\omega_y = 2W_{xz}$, and $\\omega_z = 2W_{yx}$.\n- $\\omega_x = 2W_{32} = 2(0) = 0$\n- $\\omega_y = 2W_{13} = 2(0) = 0$\n- $\\omega_z = 2W_{21} = 2(\\Omega) = 2\\Omega$\nThe vorticity vector is $\\boldsymbol{\\omega} = (0, 0, 2\\Omega)$. This indicates that the fluid is undergoing a rigid-body rotation about the $z$-axis with an angular velocity of $\\Omega$.\n\n**3. Deviatoric Stress and Incompressibility**\n\nA flow is incompressible if the divergence of its velocity field is zero.\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u} = \\frac{\\partial u_x}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial u_y}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial u_z}{\\partial z} = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0\n$$\nSince $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u} = 0$, the given flow is incompressible. This is also confirmed by the trace of the strain-rate tensor being zero: $\\text{tr}(S) = S_{xx} + S_{yy} + S_{zz} = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0$.\n\nFor an incompressible Newtonian fluid, the Cauchy stress tensor $\\sigma$ is given by the constitutive relation $\\sigma = -pI + 2\\mu S$, where $p$ is the mechanical pressure, $I$ is the identity tensor, $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, and $2\\mu S$ is the deviatoric stress tensor, often denoted $\\tau'$.\nThe deviatoric part of the Cauchy stress is therefore:\n$$\n\\tau' = 2\\mu S = 2\\mu \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & k & m \\\\\nk & 0 & 0 \\\\\nm & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0 & 2\\mu k & 2\\mu m \\\\\n2\\mu k & 0 & 0 \\\\\n2\\mu m & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis tensor represents the viscous stresses arising from the fluid's deformation.\n\n**4. Evaluation of the Q-criterion**\n\nThe $Q$-criterion is a scalar quantity used to identify vortices in a turbulent flow, defined as:\n$$\nQ = \\frac{1}{2} (\\|W\\|^2 - \\|S\\|^2)\n$$\nwhere $\\|A\\|^2 = \\text{tr}(A A^T) = \\sum_{i,j} A_{ij}^2$ is the squared Frobenius norm of a tensor $A$.\nWe compute the squared norms of $W$ and $S$:\n$$\n\\|S\\|^2 = S_{12}^2 + S_{13}^2 + S_{21}^2 + S_{31}^2 = k^2 + m^2 + k^2 + m^2 = 2k^2 + 2m^2\n$$\n$$\n\\|W\\|^2 = W_{12}^2 + W_{21}^2 = (-\\Omega)^2 + \\Omega^2 = 2\\Omega^2\n$$\nSubstituting these into the definition of $Q$:\n$$\nQ = \\frac{1}{2} (2\\Omega^2 - (2k^2 + 2m^2)) = \\Omega^2 - k^2 - m^2\n$$\nSince $\\Omega$, $k$, and $m$ are constants, the value of $Q$ is constant throughout the flow field and does not depend on the specific point $(x,y,z)$.\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values: $\\Omega = 3\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, $k = 2\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$, and $m = 1\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$.\n$$\nQ = (3\\,\\text{s}^{-1})^2 - (2\\,\\text{s}^{-1})^2 - (1\\,\\text{s}^{-1})^2 = (9 - 4 - 1)\\,\\text{s}^{-2} = 4\\,\\text{s}^{-2}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Thus, $Q = 4.000\\,\\text{s}^{-2}$.",
