            "problem": "A straight, circular duct carries a steady, fully developed, compressible internal flow of dry air with a uniform circumferential wall heat flux. The objective is to design a geometrically scaled laboratory model that reproduces the convective heat transfer of the prototype by matching the key similarity parameters that govern internal convective heat transfer in compressible flows within the context of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD): the Reynolds number (Re), the Mach number (Ma), and the Prandtl number (Pr).

The problem is a standard exercise in applying similarity principles and does not violate any fundamental laws or contain ambiguities.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A detailed solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to find the model static pressure, $P_{m}$, that satisfies the condition of Reynolds number similarity, $\\mathrm{Re}_{m} = \\mathrm{Re}_{p}$, given the other constraints.\n\nThe Reynolds number is defined as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Re} = \\frac{\\rho V D}{\\mu}\n$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the fluid density, $V$ is the bulk-flow velocity, $D$ is the characteristic length (the duct diameter), and $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity.\n\nThe Mach number is defined as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Ma} = \\frac{V}{a}\n$$\nwhere $a$ is the speed of sound. For a calorically perfect gas, the speed of sound is a function of temperature only:\n$$\na = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T}\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the ratio of specific heats, $R$ is the specific gas constant, and $T$ is the static temperature.\n\nThe gas is treated as an ideal gas, so its properties are related by the ideal gas law:\n$$\nP = \\rho R T\n$$\nwhich can be rearranged to express density as $\\rho = \\frac{P}{RT}$.\n\nThe problem states the following similarity requirements and conditions:\n1.  Reynolds number similarity: $\\mathrm{Re}_{m} = \\mathrm{Re}_{p}$\n2.  Mach number similarity: $\\mathrm{Ma}_{m} = \\mathrm{Ma}_{p}$\n3.  Model and prototype use the same gas: $\\gamma_{m} = \\gamma_{p}$ and $R_{m} = R_{p}$.\n4.  Geometric scaling: $D_{m} = \\frac{1}{2} D_{p}$\n5.  Static temperature equality: $T_{m} = T_{p}$\n6.  Dynamic viscosity equality (as a consequence of $T_m = T_p$): $\\mu_{m} = \\mu_{p}$\n\nWe begin by analyzing the consequences of the Mach number and temperature constraints. Since the gas is the same and $T_m = T_p$, the speed of sound in the model and prototype are equal:\n$$\na_{m} = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_{m}} = \\sqrt{\\gamma R T_{p}} = a_{p}\n$$\nNow, we apply the Mach number similarity condition, $\\mathrm{Ma}_{m} = \\mathrm{Ma}_{p}$:\n$$\n\\frac{V_{m}}{a_{m}} = \\frac{V_{p}}{a_{p}}\n$$\nSince $a_{m} = a_{p}$, this directly implies that the bulk-flow velocities must be equal:\n$$\nV_{m} = V_{p}\n$$\n\nNext, we enforce the Reynolds number similarity condition, $\\mathrm{Re}_{m} = \\mathrm{Re}_{p}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\rho_{m} V_{m} D_{m}}{\\mu_{m}} = \\frac{\\rho_{p} V_{p} D_{p}}{\\mu_{p}}\n$$\nWe substitute the known relationships into this equation: $V_{m} = V_{p}$, $D_{m} = \\frac{1}{2} D_{p}$, and $\\mu_{m} = \\mu_{p}$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\rho_{m} (V_{p}) (\\frac{1}{2} D_{p})}{(\\mu_{p})} = \\frac{\\rho_{p} (V_{p}) (D_{p})}{(\\mu_{p})}\n$$\nThe terms $V_p$, $D_p$, and $\\mu_p$ are non-zero and can be cancelled from both sides, simplifying the expression to a relationship between the densities:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\rho_{m} = \\rho_{p} \\implies \\rho_{m} = 2 \\rho_{p}\n$$\nTo achieve Reynolds number similarity under the given constraints, the density of the gas in the model must be twice the density of the gas in the prototype.\n\nFinally, we use the ideal gas law to relate the densities to the pressures. For the model and prototype, we have:\n$$\n\\rho_{m} = \\frac{P_{m}}{R T_{m}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\rho_{p} = \\frac{P_{p}}{R T_{p}}\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the density relationship $\\rho_{m} = 2 \\rho_{p}$:\n$$\n\\frac{P_{m}}{R T_{m}} = 2 \\frac{P_{p}}{R T_{p}}\n$$\nThe specific gas constant $R$ is the same for both and cancels. We are also given the constraint $T_{m} = T_{p}$, so the temperatures cancel as well. This leaves a direct relationship between the model and prototype pressures:\n$$\nP_{m} = 2 P_{p}\n$$\nThe problem provides the prototype static pressure $P_{p} = 5.00\\ \\mathrm{bar}$. Therefore, the required model static pressure is:\n$$\nP_{m} = 2 \\times 5.00\\ \\mathrm{bar} = 10.0\\ \\mathrm{bar}\n$$\nThe result is requested to be rounded to $3$ significant figures. The calculated value of $10.0\\ \\mathrm{bar}$ is already expressed to three significant figures.\nThe Prandtl number similarity is automatically satisfied, as stated in the problem setup. For an ideal gas, the specific heat capacity at constant pressure $c_p$ and the thermal conductivity $k$ are, like viscosity $\\mu$, primarily functions of temperature. Since $T_{m}=T_{p}$, all these properties are matched, and thus $\\mathrm{Pr}_{m} = (\\frac{\\mu c_p}{k})_m = (\\frac{\\mu c_p}{k})_p = \\mathrm{Pr}_{p}$. The entire set of similarity requirements is thus consistently satisfied.",

The gas in both cases is the same and obeys the Ideal Gas Law. The free-stream conditions at the plate leading edge are uniform, and both plates are smooth and free of discrete roughness. The external pressure gradient is negligible so that each mean boundary layer is close to a compressible zero-pressure-gradient flat-plate solution. The wall thermal condition in each case is either adiabatic or isothermal, possibly different between $A$ and $B$.

The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe objective is to find the minimal set of similarity parameters that ensures the non-dimensional problem governing T-S instability is identical for the wind tunnel (Case A) and flight (Case B). According to the problem statement, the stability analysis via LST depends on the non-dimensional mean flow profiles. Therefore, we must first determine the parameters governing the mean flow.\n\n**1. Mean Flow Governing Equations and Similarity**\n\nFor a two-dimensional, steady, compressible boundary layer over a flat plate (zero pressure gradient), the governing equations are:\n-   Continuity: $\\frac{\\partial(\\rho u)}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial(\\rho v)}{\\partial y} = 0$\n-   Momentum: $\\rho u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\rho v \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left( \\mu \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\right)$\n-   Energy: $\\rho c_p \\left( u \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial x} + v \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} \\right) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left( k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial y} \\right) + \\mu \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} \\right)^2$\n\nTo find the similarity parameters, we non-dimensionalize these equations. The non-dimensional velocity and temperature profiles, $\\tilde{u}(\\eta) = u/U_e$ and $\\tilde{T}(\\eta) = T/T_e$ (where $\\eta$ is a suitable stretched coordinate), are sought. The solution to these equations depends on the non-dimensional parameters that appear after non-dimensionalization. Standard analysis shows that the non-dimensional boundary-layer equations depend on the following parameters:\n\n-   **Edge Mach number, $M_e$**: This parameter arises from the viscous dissipation term $\\mu (\\partial u / \\partial y)^2$ in the energy equation. When non-dimensionalized, this term becomes proportional to the Eckert number, which can be expressed as $M_e^2$. It quantifies the effect of kinetic energy being converted into thermal energy, which significantly influences the temperature profile, and consequently the density and viscosity profiles, within the boundary layer.\n-   **Prandtl number, $Pr = c_p \\mu / k$**: This parameter appears in the heat conduction term of the energy equation, representing the ratio of momentum diffusivity to thermal diffusivity. It directly governs the thickness and shape of the thermal boundary layer relative to the velocity boundary layer. The problem states the gas is the same, so the functional dependence $Pr(T)$ is the same. Matching the free-stream value $Pr_e$ is typically required.\n-   **Wall thermal condition**: The boundary condition for the energy equation at the wall ($y=0$) is critical. For an isothermal wall, the temperature $T_w$ must be specified. For similarity, this must be expressed non-dimensionally, for example, as the ratio $T_w/T_e$. For an adiabatic wall ($\\partial T/\\partial y = 0$), the resulting wall temperature (the recovery temperature, $T_r$) is itself a function of $M_e$ and $Pr$. Thus, matching the *type* of thermal boundary condition (e.g., both adiabatic, or both isothermal with the same $T_w/T_e$) is necessary.\n-   **Fluid property variations**: The variation of viscosity $\\mu(T)$, thermal conductivity $k(T)$, and specific heat $c_p$ with temperature must be the same in a non-dimensional sense. The problem states the gas is the same in both cases, which automatically satisfies this condition, including the ratio of specific heats, $\\gamma = c_p/c_v$.\n\nTherefore, to ensure the non-dimensional mean flow profiles ($u/U_e$, $T/T_e$, $\\rho/\\rho_e$, etc.) are identical between Case A and Case B, one must match **$M_e$**, **$Pr$**, and the **non-dimensional wall thermal condition**.\n\n**2. Linear Stability Problem Similarity**\n\nLinear Stability Theory (LST) analyzes the growth or decay of small disturbances superimposed on the mean flow. The resulting linear eigenvalue problem (a system of ODEs, often called the compressible Orr-Sommerfeld equations) determines stability. The coefficients of this system of equations depend on:\n-   The non-dimensional mean flow profiles and their derivatives.\n-   The local Reynolds number, typically taken as $Re_\\theta$, which is the primary stability parameter.\n-   The edge Mach number, $M_e$, which appears explicitly in the stability operator in addition to its influence on the mean flow.\n-   The Prandtl number, $Pr$.\n\nFor the stability problem to be dynamically similar, the entire eigenvalue problem must be identical. This requires:\n-   The mean flow profiles to be similar, which, as shown above, requires matching $M_e$, $Pr$, and the wall thermal condition.\n-   The explicit parameters in the LST operator ($M_e$, $Pr$) must be matched.\n-   The stability is then assessed as a function of the Reynolds number, $Re_\\theta$.\n\nIf these conditions are met, the stability characteristics (e.g., neutral stability curve, amplification rates) as a function of $Re_\\theta$ will be identical for both cases. This implies that the critical Reynolds number for the onset of instability, $Re_{\\theta, \\text{crit}}$, will be the same. To compare the stability state of the two flows at a given point in their development, it is necessary to compare them at stations with the same value of $Re_\\theta$.\n\nThus, the minimal set of conditions for ensuring a predictive link for T-S transition between wind tunnel and flight is to match $M_e$, $Pr$, and the non-dimensional wall thermal condition. When comparing the stability state at a particular station, it is also necessary to match $Re_\\theta$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Match $Re_\\theta$ at the station of interest, the edge Mach number $M_e$, the Prandtl number $Pr$, and the wall thermal condition expressed as a non-dimensional wall temperature (for example, $T_w/T_e$ or equivalently $T_w$ relative to recovery temperature), so that the mean profiles and property distributions are similar.**\n\nThis option lists all the parameters identified as necessary in the derivation. Matching $M_e$, $Pr$, and the wall thermal condition ensures that the fundamental stability problem and the resulting critical Reynolds number are the same. Matching $Re_\\theta$ ensures that we are comparing the two flows at equivalent local states. This is the complete and correct set of requirements for similarity of the compressible boundary-layer stability problem.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Match only the Reynolds number based on distance from the leading edge $Re_x = \\rho_e U_e x / \\mu_e$ and the edge Mach number $M_e$; the Prandtl number and wall thermal condition need not be matched because they do not affect the linear stability operator.**\n\nThis option is incorrect. The claim that $Pr$ and the wall thermal condition do not affect the stability operator is fundamentally false for compressible flow. These parameters determine the mean temperature profile $T(y)$, which in turn sets the density $\\rho(y)$ and viscosity $\\mu(y)$ profiles. The compressible stability equations are highly sensitive to these profiles. For example, wall cooling ($T_w  T_r$) is strongly stabilizing, while wall heating is destabilizing for first-mode T-S waves. This effect is entirely controlled by the wall thermal condition and heat transfer, which depends on $Pr$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Match $Re_\\theta$ and $Pr$ only; the Mach number $M_e$ may differ as long as $Re_\\theta$ is the same, because compressibility does not directly influence T-S instability in a zero-pressure-gradient boundary layer.**\n\nThis option is incorrect. The claim that compressibility ($M_e$) does not directly influence T-S instability is false. The Mach number has a profound influence. Firstly, it affects the mean temperature profile via viscous dissipation. Secondly, it stabilizes the first-mode T-S waves and introduces new, higher-frequency instability mechanisms (the so-called \"Mack's modes,\" particularly the second mode) at supersonic and hypersonic speeds. The stability characteristics are a strong function of $M_e$. Therefore, $M_e$ must be matched.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. Match the Reynolds number based on a global plate length $Re_L = \\rho_e U_e L / \\mu_e$ and the wall temperature $T_w$; the edge Mach number $M_e$ and Prandtl number $Pr$ may be arbitrary since the mean momentum equation is unaffected by thermal transport.**\n\nThis option is incorrect. Firstly, boundary layer stability is a local phenomenon governed by local Reynolds numbers like $Re_\\theta$ or $Re_x$, not a global one like $Re_L$. Secondly, matching the dimensional wall temperature $T_w$ is incorrect; a non-dimensional parameter like $T_w/T_e$ is required for similarity. Most critically, the claim that \"the mean momentum equation is unaffected by thermal transport\" is false for compressible flow. The momentum equation contains density $\\rho$ and viscosity $\\mu$, both of which are strong functions of temperature $T$. The temperature field is governed by the energy equation where $M_e$ and $Pr$ are key parameters. This strong coupling between the momentum and energy equations is a central feature of compressible flow, so $M_e$ and $Pr$ are essential parameters for the velocity profile and its stability.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",
