            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the number of independent dimensionless groups for a capillary-influenced micro-scale flow. The process involves dimensional analysis using the Buckingham $\\Pi$ theorem.\n\nFirst, the problem statement is validated.\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Variable set: $\\{U, L, \\rho, \\mu, \\sigma\\}$\n- $U$: characteristic velocity\n- $L$: characteristic length\n- $\\rho$: mass density\n- $\\mu$: dynamic viscosity\n- $\\sigma$: surface tension\n- Base dimension set: $\\{M, L, T\\}$, where $M$ is mass, $L$ is length, and $T$ is time.\n- Required derivations: Dimensional exponents for each variable from fundamental principles.\n- Required construction: Dimensional matrix with rows ordered as $\\{M, L, T\\}$ and columns as $\\{U, L, \\rho, \\mu, \\sigma\\}$.\n- Required calculations: Rank of the dimensional matrix and the number of independent dimensionless groups.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, as it deals with a standard fluid dynamics scenario using established physical quantities. It is well-posed, providing all necessary variables and a clear objective. The language is precise and objective. There are no internal contradictions, missing information, or scientifically implausible assumptions. The problem is a standard application of the Buckingham $\\Pi$ theorem, a fundamental tool in fluid mechanics and engineering.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of Dimensions**\n\nThe dimensions of each variable in the set $\\{U, L, \\rho, \\mu, \\sigma\\}$ are derived with respect to the base dimension set $\\{M, L, T\\}$.\n\n1.  **Characteristic Velocity ($U$)**: From kinematics, velocity is defined as the rate of change of displacement (length, $L$) with respect to time ($T$).\n    $$ [U] = \\frac{[L]}{[T]} = L^1 T^{-1} = M^0 L^1 T^{-1} $$\n\n2.  **Characteristic Length ($L$)**: Length is a fundamental dimension in the chosen base set.\n    $$ [L] = L^1 = M^0 L^1 T^0 $$\n\n3.  **Mass Density ($\\rho$)**: Density is defined as mass ($M$) per unit volume. Volume has dimensions of length cubed ($L^3$).\n    $$ [\\rho] = \\frac{[M]}{[L^3]} = M^1 L^{-3} = M^1 L^{-3} T^0 $$\n\n4.  **Dynamic Viscosity ($\\mu$)**: The Newtonian fluid constitutive relation states that shear stress, $\\tau$, is proportional to the rate of shear strain, $\\dot{\\gamma}$, with the dynamic viscosity as the constant of proportionality: $\\tau = \\mu \\dot{\\gamma}$.\n    - Shear stress ($\\tau$) is force per unit area. Force ($F$) has dimensions derived from Newton's second law ($F = ma$): $[F] = [M][L T^{-2}] = M^1 L^1 T^{-2}$.\n    - Area ($A$) has dimensions $L^2$.\n    - Therefore, the dimensions of stress are $[\\tau] = \\frac{[F]}{[A]} = \\frac{M L T^{-2}}{L^2} = M^1 L^{-1} T^{-2}$.\n    - The rate of shear strain ($\\dot{\\gamma}$) is a velocity gradient, $\\frac{dU}{dy}$, so its dimensions are $\\frac{[U]}{[L]} = \\frac{L T^{-1}}{L} = T^{-1}$.\n    - From the constitutive relation, the dimensions of viscosity are $[\\mu] = \\frac{[\\tau]}{[\\dot{\\gamma}]} = \\frac{M L^{-1} T^{-2}}{T^{-1}} = M^1 L^{-1} T^{-1}$.\n\n5.  **Surface Tension ($\\sigma$)**: Surface tension is defined as force per unit length.\n    - Using the dimensions of force derived above, $[F] = M^1 L^1 T^{-2}$.\n    - The dimensions of surface tension are $[\\sigma] = \\frac{[F]}{[L]} = \\frac{M L T^{-2}}{L} = M^1 L^0 T^{-2}$.\n\n**Dimensional Matrix Construction**\n\nThe dimensional matrix, denoted as $D$, is constructed using the exponents of the fundamental dimensions $\\{M, L, T\\}$ for each of the variables $\\{U, L, \\rho, \\mu, \\sigma\\}$. The rows correspond to the dimensions $M$, $L$, and $T$, and the columns correspond to the variables in the specified order.\n\n- Column for $U$: $M^0 L^1 T^{-1} \\implies \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n- Column for $L$: $M^0 L^1 T^0 \\implies \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n- Column for $\\rho$: $M^1 L^{-3} T^0 \\implies \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -3 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n- Column for $\\mu$: $M^1 L^{-1} T^{-1} \\implies \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ -1 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix}$\n- Column for $\\sigma$: $M^1 L^0 T^{-2} \\implies \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -2 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nThe resulting $3 \\times 5$ dimensional matrix is:\n$$ D = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0  0  1  1  1 \\\\\n1  1  -3  -1  0 \\\\\n-1  0  0  -1  -2\n\\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n**Rank of the Dimensional Matrix**\n\nThe rank of the matrix $D$, denoted as $k$, is the number of linearly independent rows or columns. The maximum possible rank is $\\min(3, 5) = 3$. We can determine the rank by finding a non-zero determinant for a square submatrix of the largest possible size, which is $3 \\times 3$. Let us select the submatrix formed by the columns corresponding to $\\rho$, $\\mu$, and $\\sigma$.\n$$ D_{\\text{sub}} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1  1  1 \\\\\n-3  -1  0 \\\\\n0  -1  -2\n\\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe determinant of this submatrix is:\n$$ \\det(D_{\\text{sub}}) = 1 \\begin{vmatrix} -1  0 \\\\ -1  -2 \\end{vmatrix} - 1 \\begin{vmatrix} -3  0 \\\\ 0  -2 \\end{vmatrix} + 1 \\begin{vmatrix} -3  -1 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{vmatrix} $$\n$$ \\det(D_{\\text{sub}}) = 1((-1)(-2) - (0)(-1)) - 1((-3)(-2) - (0)(0)) + 1((-3)(-1) - (-1)(0)) $$\n$$ \\det(D_{\\text{sub}}) = 1(2) - 1(6) + 1(3) = 2 - 6 + 3 = -1 $$\nSince the determinant is non-zero ($-1$), the three columns are linearly independent. This confirms that the rank of the dimensional matrix $D$ is $3$.\n$$ k = \\text{rank}(D) = 3 $$\n\n**Application of the Buckingham $\\Pi$ Theorem**\n\nThe Buckingham $\\Pi$ theorem states that the number of independent dimensionless groups, $p$, that can be formed from a set of $n$ variables is given by the equation:\n$$ p = n - k $$\nwhere $n$ is the number of physical variables and $k$ is the rank of the dimensional matrix (which is also the number of fundamental dimensions required to describe the variables).\n\nIn this problem:\n- The number of variables is $n = 5$ (namely, $U$, $L$, $\\rho$, $\\mu$, $\\sigma$).\n- The rank of the dimensional matrix is $k = 3$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the theorem's formula:\n$$ p = 5 - 3 = 2 $$\nTherefore, there are $2$ independent dimensionless groups required to describe the specified flow. These groups are typically the Reynolds number ($Re = \\frac{\\rho U L}{\\mu}$) and the Weber number ($We = \\frac{\\rho U^2 L}{\\sigma}$), or any independent combination thereof.",

In an analysis relevant to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), suppose the onset of droplet breakup depends only on these variables and the crossflow speed, so that any predictive criterion can be expressed as a relation among dimensionless groups formed from the set $\\{\\rho_{g}, \\rho_{l}, \\mu_{g}, \\mu_{l}, \\sigma, U, d\\}$.\n\nUsing the Buckingham $\\Pi$ theorem with mass $M$, length $L$, and time $T$ as fundamental dimensions, systematically derive a complete and minimal set of independent dimensionless groups for this problem, starting from the dimensional content of each variable.

            "solution": "The problem of determining the onset of droplet breakup based on the provided physical variables is a classic application of dimensional analysis. We will employ the Buckingham $\\Pi$ theorem to derive a complete and minimal set of independent dimensionless groups.\n\nThe first step is to list all relevant variables and their fundamental dimensions in the Mass-Length-Time ($M, L, T$) system.\nThe total number of variables is $n=7$. The variables and their dimensions are:\n1. Gas density, $\\rho_{g}$: $[\\rho_{g}] = M L^{-3}$\n2. Liquid density, $\\rho_{l}$: $[\\rho_{l}] = M L^{-3}$\n3.

Droplet diameter, $d$: $[d] = L$\n\nThe number of fundamental dimensions is $k=3$ (namely $M$, $L$, and $T$).\nAccording to the Buckingham $\\Pi$ theorem, the number of independent dimensionless groups (or $\\Pi$ groups) is $p = n - k = 7 - 3 = 4$.\n\nNext, we must select a set of $k=3$ repeating variables. These variables must, among them, contain all the fundamental dimensions and must be dimensionally independent. A suitable choice for problems in fluid mechanics typically involves a density, a velocity, and a length scale. We select $\\{\\rho_{g}, U, d\\}$ as our repeating variables. Their dimensions are $[\\rho_{g}] = M L^{-3}$, $[U] = L T^{-1}$, and $[d] = L$. They contain $M$, $L$, and $T$, and are dimensionally independent, as can be verified by forming the dimensional matrix and checking that its determinant is non-zero.\n\nWe now form the $p=4$ dimensionless $\\Pi$ groups by combining each of the remaining variables ($\\rho_{l}$, $\\mu_{g}$, $\\mu_{l}$, $\\sigma$) with the repeating variables raised to unknown exponents.\n\n1.  For $\\Pi_1$, using $\\rho_{l}$:\n    $$ \\Pi_1 = \\rho_{l} \\cdot (\\rho_{g})^{a_1} (U)^{b_1} (d)^{c_1} $$\n    In terms of dimensions:\n    $$ M^0 L^0 T^0 = (M L^{-3}) \\cdot (M L^{-3})^{a_1} (L T^{-1})^{b_1} (L)^{c_1} = M^{1+a_1} L^{-3-3a_1+b_1+c_1} T^{-b_1} $$\n    Equating exponents for each dimension:\n    $M: 1 + a_1 = 0 \\implies a_1 = -1$\n    $T: -b_1 = 0 \\implies b_1 = 0$\n    $L: -3 - 3a_1 + b_1 + c_1 = 0 \\implies -3 - 3(-1) + 0 + c_1 = 0 \\implies c_1 = 0$\n    Thus, $\\Pi_1 = \\rho_{l} \\rho_{g}^{-1} = \\frac{\\rho_{l}}{\\rho_{g}}$.\n\n2.  For $\\Pi_2$, using $\\mu_{g}$:\n    $$ \\Pi_2 = \\mu_{g} \\cdot (\\rho_{g})^{a_2} (U)^{b_2} (d)^{c_2} $$\n    $$ M^0 L^0 T^0 = (M L^{-1} T^{-1}) \\cdot (M L^{-3})^{a_2} (L T^{-1})^{b_2} (L)^{c_2} = M^{1+a_2} L^{-1-3a_2+b_2+c_2} T^{-1-b_2} $$\n    $M: 1 + a_2 = 0 \\implies a_2 = -1$\n    $T: -1 - b_2 = 0 \\implies b_2 = -1$\n    $L: -1 - 3a_2 + b_2 + c_2 = 0 \\implies -1 - 3(-1) - 1 + c_2 = 0 \\implies 1 + c_2 = 0 \\implies c_2 = -1$\n    Thus, $\\Pi_2 = \\mu_{g} \\rho_{g}^{-1} U^{-1} d^{-1} = \\frac{\\mu_{g}}{\\rho_{g} U d}$.

For $\\Pi_4$, using $\\sigma$:\n    $$ \\Pi_4 = \\sigma \\cdot (\\rho_{g})^{a_4} (U)^{b_4} (d)^{c_4} $$\n    $$ M^0 L^0 T^0 = (M T^{-2}) \\cdot (M L^{-3})^{a_4} (L T^{-1})^{b_4} (L)^{c_4} = M^{1+a_4} L^{-3a_4+b_4+c_4} T^{-2-b_4} $$\n    $M: 1 + a_4 = 0 \\implies a_4 = -1$\n    $T: -2 - b_4 = 0 \\implies b_4 = -2$\n    $L: -3a_4 + b_4 + c_4 = 0 \\implies -3(-1) - 2 + c_4 = 0 \\implies 1 + c_4 = 0 \\implies c_4 = -1$\n    Thus, $\\Pi_4 = \\sigma \\rho_{g}^{-1} U^{-2} d^{-1} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\rho_{g} U^2 d}$.

Any arbitrary function of these groups, $\\Phi(\\Pi_1, \\Pi_2, \\Pi_3, \\Pi_4) = \\text{constant}$, describes the physical relationship.\n\nThe problem requires us to reorganize this set to expose three specific physical groups. Since any product or ratio of dimensionless groups is also a dimensionless group, we can construct the desired groups from our initial set.\n\n1.  **Density Ratio ($\\rho_l/\\rho_g$):** This group is directly our first derived group, $\\Pi_1$.\n    $$ \\frac{\\rho_{l}}{\\rho_{g}} = \\Pi_1 $$\n\n2.  **Liquid-based Weber Number ($We_l$):** The Weber number represents the ratio of inertial forces to surface tension forces. The liquid-based version uses the liquid density for the inertial scale.\n    $$ We_{l} = \\frac{\\text{Inertial Force}}{\\text{Surface Tension Force}} \\sim \\frac{\\rho_{l} U^2 d^2}{\\sigma d} = \\frac{\\rho_{l} U^2 d}{\\sigma} $$\n    This can be formed from our derived set as a combination of $\\Pi_1$ and $\\Pi_4$:\n    $$ We_{l} = \\frac{\\rho_{l} U^2 d}{\\sigma} = \\left(\\frac{\\rho_{l}}{\\rho_{g}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\rho_{g} U^2 d}{\\sigma}\\right) = \\Pi_1 \\cdot (\\Pi_4)^{-1} $$\n\n3.  **Liquid-based Ohnesorge Number ($Oh_l$):** The Ohnesorge number relates viscous forces to the geometric mean of inertial and surface tension forces. It is typically defined using the properties of the liquid phase.\n    $$ Oh_{l} = \\frac{\\text{Viscous Force}}{\\sqrt{(\\text{Inertial Force}) \\cdot (\\text{Surface Tension Force})}} \\sim \\frac{\\mu_{l} U d}{\\sqrt{(\\rho_{l} U^2 d^2)(\\sigma d)}} = \\frac{\\mu_{l}}{\\sqrt{\\rho_{l} \\sigma d}} $$\n    Let's verify its composition from our derived set:\n    $$ Oh_{l} = \\frac{\\mu_{l}}{\\sqrt{\\rho_{l} \\sigma d}} = \\frac{\\mu_{l}/(\\rho_{g} U d)}{\\sqrt{(\\rho_{l}/\\rho_{g}) \\cdot (\\sigma/(\\rho_{g} U^2 d))}} = \\frac{\\Pi_3}{\\sqrt{\\Pi_1 \\cdot \\Pi_4}} $$\n    Since $We_l$, $Oh_l$, and $\\rho_l/\\rho_g$ can be expressed as combinations of the elements of our complete minimal set, they are valid dimensionless parameters for this problem.\n\nThe problem asks for the explicit analytic expressions for these three groups.\n\n1) Liquid-based Weber number: $We_{l} = \\frac{\\rho_{l} U^2 d}{\\sigma}$\n2) Liquid-based Ohnesorge number: $Oh_{l} = \\frac{\\mu_{l}}{\\sqrt{\\rho_{l} \\sigma d}}$\n3) Density ratio: $\\frac{\\rho_{l}}{\\rho_{g}}$\nThese are the required expressions.",

We substitute this into the discrete equation:\n$$ u_0 \\hat{u}_i^{n+1} = u_0 \\hat{u}_i^n - \\frac{U \\Delta t}{\\Delta x} (u_0 \\hat{u}_i^n - u_0 \\hat{u}_{i-1}^n) $$\nAssuming $u_0 \\neq 0$, we can divide the entire equation by the constant $u_0$:\n$$ \\hat{u}_i^{n+1} = \\hat{u}_i^n - \\frac{U \\Delta t}{\\Delta x} (\\hat{u}_i^n - \\hat{u}_{i-1}^n) $$\nIn this nondimensionalized update equation, the coefficient that multiplies the discrete spatial difference term $(\\hat{u}_i^n - \\hat{u}_{i-1}^n)$ is $\\frac{U \\Delta t}{\\Delta x}$. This is precisely the dimensionless group identified in Task 1.\n\n**Task 3: Physical Justification of the CFL Condition**\n\nThis dimensionless parameter, conventionally denoted as $\\sigma$ or $C$, is the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) number:\n$$ \\sigma = \\frac{U \\Delta t}{\\Delta x} $$\nThe nondimensional discrete update equation can be written as:\n$$ \\hat{u}_i^{n+1} = \\hat{u}_i^n - \\sigma (\\hat{u}_i^n - \\hat{u}_{i-1}^n) $$\nRearranging this gives:\n$$ \\hat{u}_i^{n+1} = (1 - \\sigma)\\hat{u}_i^n + \\sigma \\hat{u}_{i-1}^n $$\nThis equation shows that the new value at grid point $i$ at time step $n+1$ is an interpolation of the values at the previous time step at grid points $i$ and $i-1$. The numerical domain of dependence for the point $(x_i, t^{n+1})$ is the spatial interval $[x_{i-1}, x_i]$ at time $t^n$.\n\nThe continuous advection equation $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + U \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0$ describes information propagating along characteristic curves defined by $\\frac{dx}{dt} = U$. The solution at a point $(x, t)$ is determined by the value at an earlier point on the characteristic line that passes through $(x, t)$. Thus, the true physical value at $(x_i, t^{n+1})$ is determined by the value at the point $x_p = x_i - U \\Delta t$ at the previous time $t^n$. This point $x_p$ is the foot of the characteristic in the physical domain of dependence.\n\nFor a numerical scheme to be stable, its numerical domain of dependence must contain the physical domain of dependence. If it does not, the scheme cannot access the information required to correctly compute the solution, leading to unphysical oscillations and divergence.\n\nTherefore, the point $x_p$ must lie within the numerical scheme's stencil, which is the interval $[x_{i-1}, x_i]$:\n$$ x_{i-1} \\le x_p \\le x_i $$\nSubstituting $x_p = x_i - U \\Delta t$ and $x_{i-1} = x_i - \\Delta x$:\n$$ x_i - \\Delta x \\le x_i - U \\Delta t \\le x_i $$\nThe right-hand inequality, $x_i - U \\Delta t \\le x_i$, simplifies to $-U \\Delta t \\le 0$, which is always true for $U  0$ and $\\Delta t  0$.\nThe left-hand inequality is the critical constraint:\n$$ x_i - \\Delta x \\le x_i - U \\Delta t $$\n$$ -\\Delta x \\le -U \\Delta t $$\nMultiplying by $-1$ and reversing the inequality sign:\n$$ \\Delta x \\ge U \\Delta t $$\nDividing by $\\Delta x$ (which is positive):\n$$ 1 \\ge \\frac{U \\Delta t}{\\Delta x} $$\nThis shows that the dimensionless group $\\sigma = \\frac{U \\Delta t}{\\Delta x}$ must be less than or equal to $1$ for stability. The quantity $U \\Delta t$ is the distance the physical information travels in one time step, while $\\Delta x$ is the size of a grid cell. The condition $\\sigma \\le 1$ ensures that in one time step, the wave does not propagate further than one grid cell, meaning the numerical scheme has access to the necessary physical information from the upwind direction. This is why the CFL number, $\\sigma$, controls the stability and the domain of dependence of the discrete scheme.",
