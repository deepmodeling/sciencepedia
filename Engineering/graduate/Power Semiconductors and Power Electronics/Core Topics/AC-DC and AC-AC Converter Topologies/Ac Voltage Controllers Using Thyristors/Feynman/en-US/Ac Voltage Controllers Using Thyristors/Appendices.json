It is a formalizable, complete, and standard academic problem.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A complete solution will be derived as requested.\n\nThe root-mean-square (RMS) value of a periodic voltage $v_{o}(t)$ with period $T$ is defined as:\n$$ V_{o,\\mathrm{rms}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} v_{o}^{2}(t) \\, dt} $$\nThe source voltage is $v_{s}(t) = V_{m} \\sin(\\omega t)$, which has a period $T = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}$. We perform a change of variables from time $t$ to the electrical angle $\\theta = \\omega t$. This implies $dt = \\frac{d\\theta}{\\omega}$. The integration interval over one full period becomes $0$ to $2\\pi$ in terms of $\\theta$.\nThe RMS definition in terms of $\\theta$ is:\n$$ V_{o,\\mathrm{rms}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} v_{o}^{2}(\\theta) \\, d\\theta} $$\nThe output voltage $v_{o}(\\theta)$ is determined by the SCRs' state. Due to symmetric firing, the behavior in the positive and negative half-cycles of the source voltage is structurally similar.\nFor the positive half-cycle, $0 \\leq \\theta \\leq \\pi$:\n- The first SCR is forward-biased but blocked for $0 \\leq \\theta < \\alpha$. Thus, $v_{o}(\\theta) = 0$.\n- The SCR is triggered at $\\theta = \\alpha$ and conducts until the current naturally commutates at $\\theta = \\pi$. For a resistive load, voltage and current are in phase, so conduction occurs for $\\alpha \\leq \\theta \\leq \\pi$. During this interval, $v_{o}(\\theta) = v_{s}(\\theta) = V_{m} \\sin(\\theta)$.\n\nFor the negative half-cycle, $\\pi \\leq \\theta \\leq 2\\pi$:\n- The second SCR is forward-biased but blocked for $\\pi \\leq \\theta < \\pi+\\alpha$. Thus, $v_{o}(\\theta) = 0$.\n- The SCR is triggered at $\\theta = \\pi+\\alpha$ and conducts until the current commutates at $\\theta = 2\\pi$. During this interval, $\\pi+\\alpha \\leq \\theta \\leq 2\\pi$, the output voltage is $v_{o}(\\theta) = v_{s}(\\theta) = V_{m} \\sin(\\theta)$.\n\nThe square of the output voltage, $v_{o}^{2}(\\theta)$, is therefore:\n$$\nv_{o}^{2}(\\theta) =\n\\begin{cases}\n(V_{m} \\sin(\\theta))^{2} & \\text{for } \\alpha \\leq \\theta \\leq \\pi \\\\\n(V_{m} \\sin(\\theta))^{2} & \\text{for } \\pi+\\alpha \\leq \\theta \\leq 2\\pi \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nNow, we compute the integral for the squared RMS voltage, $V_{o,\\mathrm{rms}}^{2}$:\n$$ V_{o,\\mathrm{rms}}^{2} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} v_{o}^{2}(\\theta) \\, d\\theta = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left[ \\int_{\\alpha}^{\\pi} (V_{m} \\sin(\\theta))^{2} \\, d\\theta + \\int_{\\pi+\\alpha}^{2\\pi} (V_{m} \\sin(\\theta))^{2} \\, d\\theta \\right] $$\n$$ V_{o,\\mathrm{rms}}^{2} = \\frac{V_{m}^{2}}{2\\pi} \\left[ \\int_{\\alpha}^{\\pi} \\sin^{2}(\\theta) \\, d\\theta + \\int_{\\pi+\\alpha}^{2\\pi} \\sin^{2}(\\theta) \\, d\\theta \\right] $$\nDue to the symmetry of the $\\sin^{2}(\\theta)$ function about $\\theta=\\pi$, the integral over the second conduction interval is identical to the first. Specifically, let $\\phi = \\theta - \\pi$. The integral becomes $\\int_{\\alpha}^{\\pi} \\sin^{2}(\\phi+\\pi) \\, d\\phi = \\int_{\\alpha}^{\\pi} (-\\sin(\\phi))^{2} \\, d\\phi = \\int_{\\alpha}^{\\pi} \\sin^{2}(\\phi) \\, d\\phi$.\nTherefore, the expression simplifies to:\n$$ V_{o,\\mathrm{rms}}^{2} = \\frac{V_{m}^{2}}{2\\pi} \\left[ 2 \\int_{\\alpha}^{\\pi} \\sin^{2}(\\theta) \\, d\\theta \\right] = \\frac{V_{m}^{2}}{\\pi} \\int_{\\alpha}^{\\pi} \\sin^{2}(\\theta) \\, d\\theta $$\nTo evaluate the integral, we use the trigonometric power-reduction identity:\n$$ \\sin^{2}(\\theta) = \\frac{1 - \\cos(2\\theta)}{2} $$\nSubstituting this into the integral:\n$$ \\int_{\\alpha}^{\\pi} \\sin^{2}(\\theta) \\, d\\theta = \\int_{\\alpha}^{\\pi} \\frac{1 - \\cos(2\\theta)}{2} \\, d\\theta = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\int_{\\alpha}^{\\pi} 1 \\, d\\theta - \\int_{\\alpha}^{\\pi} \\cos(2\\theta) \\, d\\theta \\right] $$\nThe antiderivative of $\\cos(2\\theta)$ is $\\frac{\\sin(2\\theta)}{2}$. Evaluating the definite integral:\n$$ = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ [\\theta]_{\\alpha}^{\\pi} - \\left[\\frac{\\sin(2\\theta)}{2}\\right]_{\\alpha}^{\\pi} \\right] $$\n$$ = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (\\pi - \\alpha) - \\left( \\frac{\\sin(2\\pi)}{2} - \\frac{\\sin(2\\alpha)}{2} \\right) \\right] $$\n$$ = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\pi - \\alpha - \\left( 0 - \\frac{\\sin(2\\alpha)}{2} \\right) \\right] $$\n$$ = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\pi - \\alpha + \\frac{\\sin(2\\alpha)}{2} \\right] $$\nNow, we substitute this result back into the expression for $V_{o,\\mathrm{rms}}^{2}$:\n$$ V_{o,\\mathrm{rms}}^{2} = \\frac{V_{m}^{2}}{\\pi} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\pi - \\alpha + \\frac{\\sin(2\\alpha)}{2} \\right] \\right) $$\n$$ V_{o,\\mathrm{rms}}^{2} = \\frac{V_{m}^{2}}{2\\pi} \\left( \\pi - \\alpha + \\frac{\\sin(2\\alpha)}{2} \\right) $$\nFinally, taking the square root of both sides yields the expression for the RMS output voltage, $V_{o,\\mathrm{rms}}$:\n$$ V_{o,\\mathrm{rms}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{V_{m}^{2}}{2\\pi} \\left( \\pi - \\alpha + \\frac{\\sin(2\\alpha)}{2} \\right)} $$\n$$ V_{o,\\mathrm{rms}} = V_{m} \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\left( \\pi - \\alpha + \\frac{\\sin(2\\alpha)}{2} \\right)} $$\nThis is the final closed-form analytical expression for the RMS output voltage in terms of the peak source voltage $V_{m}$ and the firing angle $\\alpha$.",
