We can solve for the duration in time, $\\Delta t$, corresponding to a change in electrical angle, $\\Delta \\theta$, by separating variables and integrating.\n$$\nd\\theta = \\omega \\, dt\n$$\nThe commutation overlap is defined as an interval spanning an electrical angle of $\\mu$. The corresponding duration in time is $t_{\\mu}$. We integrate over this interval.

In a three-phase rectifier, commutation is the process where the load current transfers from one conducting semiconductor device (e.g., a diode in an uncontrolled rectifier) to the next device in the conduction sequence. In an ideal system with zero source inductance, this transfer would be instantaneous. However, any real AC source has some inductance, $L_s$. This inductance opposes instantaneous changes in current ($v_L = L_s \\frac{di}{dt}$). Consequently, the current in the outgoing device cannot fall to zero instantly, and the current in the incoming device cannot rise to the full load current instantly. The commutation duration, $t_{\\mu}$, is the finite interval of time during which both the outgoing and incoming devices conduct simultaneously, allowing for the gradual transfer of current. During this time, the two affected phases of the AC source are effectively short-circuited through the two conducting diodes, leading to a temporary distortion (or \"notch\") in the AC voltage waveform and a reduction in the average DC output voltage of the rectifier. The value $t_{\\mu} = 8.333 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{s}$ is the physical time it takes for this current transfer process to complete under the specified conditions.",

In a line-commutated converter with source inductance, this transfer is not instantaneous. During the commutation interval, two AC phases are temporarily short-circuited through the source inductance.\n\nThe problem states that the commutation is driven by the line-to-line voltage, $v_{\\mathrm{LL}}(t)$, appearing across the total commutation inductance, $L_s$. The fundamental relationship governing the inductor is $v = L \\frac{di}{dt}$. Let $i_c(t)$ be the current in the incoming phase, which rises from $0$ to $I_d$ during the commutation interval.

Substitute the model equation $\\mu_k = \\kappa I_{d,k} + \\varepsilon_k$ into the expression for $\\hat{\\kappa}$:\n$$\\hat{\\kappa} = \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} (\\kappa I_{d,k} + \\varepsilon_k) I_{d,k}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} I_{d,k}^2} = \\frac{\\kappa \\sum_{k=1}^{N} I_{d,k}^2 + \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\varepsilon_k I_{d,k}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} I_{d,k}^2} = \\kappa + \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\varepsilon_k I_{d,k}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} I_{d,k}^2}$$\nThe variance of $\\hat{\\kappa}$ is then:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\kappa}) = \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\kappa + \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\varepsilon_k I_{d,k}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} I_{d,k}^2}\\right)$$\nSince $\\kappa$ is a constant, and the $I_{d,k}$ values are considered fixed regressors with no measurement error, this simplifies to:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\kappa}) = \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\varepsilon_k I_{d,k}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} I_{d,k}^2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{N} I_{d,k}^2\\right)^2} \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\varepsilon_k I_{d,k}\\right)$$\nThe noise terms $\\varepsilon_k$ are independent, so the variance of their weighted sum is the weighted sum of their variances:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\varepsilon_k I_{d,k}\\right) = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\mathrm{Var}(\\varepsilon_k I_{d,k}) = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} I_{d,k}^2 \\mathrm{Var}(\\varepsilon_k)$$\nGiven that $\\mathrm{Var}(\\varepsilon_k) = \\sigma_{\\mu}^2$ for all $k$:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\varepsilon_k I_{d,k}\\right) = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} I_{d,k}^2 \\sigma_{\\mu}^2 = \\sigma_{\\mu}^2 \\sum_{k=1}^{N} I_{d,k}^2$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\kappa})$:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\kappa}) = \\frac{1}{\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{N} I_{d,k}^2\\right)^2} \\left(\\sigma_{\\mu}^2 \\sum_{k=1}^{N} I_{d,k}^2\\right) = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mu}^2}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} I_{d,k}^2}$$\nFinally, we find the variance of the estimator $\\hat{L_s}$. Since $\\hat{L_s} = \\hat{\\kappa} \\frac{\\hat{V}_{\\mathrm{LL}}}{\\omega}$, and $\\frac{\\hat{V}_{\\mathrm{LL}}}{\\omega}$ is a constant factor:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{L_s}) = \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\hat{\\kappa} \\frac{\\hat{V}_{\\mathrm{LL}}}{\\omega}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{\\hat{V}_{\\mathrm{LL}}}{\\omega}\\right)^2 \\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\kappa})$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{\\kappa})$ yields the final closed-form expression for the variance of the $L_s$ estimator:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(\\hat{L_s}) = \\left(\\frac{\\hat{V}_{\\mathrm{LL}}}{\\omega}\\right)^2 \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mu}^2}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} I_{d,k}^2}$$\n\n**4.
