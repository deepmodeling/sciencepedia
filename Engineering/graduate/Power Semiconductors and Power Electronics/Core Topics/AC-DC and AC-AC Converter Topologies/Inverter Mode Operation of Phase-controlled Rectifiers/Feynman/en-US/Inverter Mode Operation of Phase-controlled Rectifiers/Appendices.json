            "solution": "The analysis begins with the commutation process in a three-phase, six-pulse, fully controlled bridge converter. We consider the specific commutation from thyristor T5 (connected to AC phase 'c') to thyristor T1 (connected to AC phase 'a') on the positive side of the DC link. For this analysis, we define a set of balanced three-phase line-to-line voltages. It is convenient to select the angular reference such that the mathematical description is simplified. Let the line-to-line voltage that drives the commutation, $v_{ac} = v_a - v_c$, be described as $v_{ac}(\\theta) = V_{LL,max} \\sin(\\theta)$, where $\\theta = \\omega t$ is the electrical angle and $V_{LL,max} = \\sqrt{2} V_{LL}$ is the peak value of the line-to-line voltage.\n\nThe problem states that the firing delay angle $\\alpha$ is measured from the \"zero crossing (in the positive-going sense) of the corresponding line-to-line voltage that would naturally initiate commutation in the uncontrolled bridge.\" In an uncontrolled (diode) bridge, commutation would begin at the point where the commutating voltage $v_{ac}$ becomes positive, which is at the positive-going zero crossing. With our choice of $v_{ac}(\\theta) = V_{LL,max} \\sin(\\theta)$, this natural commutation point occurs at $\\theta=0$. Therefore, the firing of thyristor T1 is delayed by an angle $\\alpha$ from this reference, and commutation starts at $\\theta_1 = \\alpha$. The commutation process takes a finite duration, defined by the overlap angle $\\mu$. Thus, commutation ends at the angle $\\theta_2 = \\alpha + \\mu$.\n\nDuring the commutation interval, from $\\theta = \\alpha$ to $\\theta = \\alpha + \\mu$, thyristors T1 and T5 are simultaneously conducting on the positive side. This creates a short-circuit path between phases 'a' and 'c' through their respective source inductances, $L_s$. Applying Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (which is an expression of the inductor voltage law) to the commutation loop yields:\n$$v_a - L_s \\frac{di_a}{dt} = v_c - L_s \\frac{di_c}{dt}$$\nwhere $i_a$ and $i_c$ are the currents in phases 'a' and 'c', respectively.\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n$$v_a - v_c = L_s \\frac{di_a}{dt} - L_s \\frac{di_c}{dt}$$\nThe problem assumes a constant direct current $I_d$. During the commutation from T5 to T1, the total current flowing to the DC link from the positive side is shared between these two thyristors. Thus, $i_a + i_c = I_d$. Differentiating with respect to time gives $\\frac{di_a}{dt} + \\frac{di_c}{dt} = 0$, which implies $\\frac{di_c}{dt} = -\\frac{di_a}{dt}$. Substituting this into the KVL equation:\n$$v_a - v_c = L_s \\frac{di_a}{dt} - L_s \\left(-\\frac{di_a}{dt}\\right) = 2 L_s \\frac{di_a}{dt}$$\nThis confirms the effective commutation inductance is $2L_s$. The driving voltage is $v_{ac} = v_a - v_c$. So, we have the fundamental differential equation for the commutation process:\n$$v_{ac}(t) = 2 L_s \\frac{di_a}{dt}$$\nTo solve for the overlap angle $\\mu$, we express this equation in terms of the angle $\\theta = \\omega t$, where $\\omega = 2\\pi f$. using the chain rule, $\\frac{di_a}{dt} = \\frac{di_a}{d\\theta}\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} = \\omega \\frac{di_a}{d\\theta}$.\n$$v_{ac}(\\theta) = 2 L_s \\omega \\frac{di_a}{d\\theta}$$\nSubstituting the expression for the commutating voltage, $v_{ac}(\\theta) = \\sqrt{2} V_{LL} \\sin(\\theta)$:\n$$\\sqrt{2} V_{LL} \\sin(\\theta) = 2 \\omega L_s \\frac{di_a}{d\\theta}$$\nWe can now separate variables and integrate over the commutation interval. The current $i_a$ in the incoming thyristor T1 increases from $0$ to the full direct current $I_d$ as the angle $\\theta$ advances from $\\alpha$ to $\\alpha+\\mu$.\n$$\\int_0^{I_d} di_a = \\int_{\\alpha}^{\\alpha+\\mu} \\frac{\\sqrt{2} V_{LL}}{2 \\omega L_s} \\sin(\\theta) d\\theta$$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$I_d = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} V_{LL}}{2 \\omega L_s} [-\\cos(\\theta)]_{\\alpha}^{\\alpha+\\mu}$$\n$$I_d = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} V_{LL}}{2 \\omega L_s} (-\\cos(\\alpha+\\mu) - (-\\cos(\\alpha)))$$\n$$I_d = \\frac{\\sqrt{2} V_{LL}}{2 \\omega L_s} (\\cos(\\alpha) - \\cos(\\alpha+\\mu))$$\nThis is the derived expression relating the overlap angle $\\mu$ to the system parameters. We can now solve for $\\mu$. First, we rearrange the equation:\n$$\\cos(\\alpha+\\mu) = \\cos(\\alpha) - \\frac{2 \\omega L_s I_d}{\\sqrt{2} V_{LL}}$$\nSubstituting $\\omega = 2\\pi f$:\n$$\\cos(\\alpha+\\mu) = \\cos(\\alpha) - \\frac{2 (2\\pi f) L_s I_d}{\\sqrt{2} V_{LL}} = \\cos(\\alpha) - \\frac{2 \\sqrt{2} \\pi f L_s I_d}{V_{LL}}$$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $V_{LL} = 11 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{V}$\n- $L_s = 3.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{H}$\n- $I_d = 1.0 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{A}$\n- $f = 50\\,\\text{Hz}$\n- $\\alpha = 150^\\circ$\n\nLet's compute the second term on the right-hand side:\n$$\\frac{2 \\sqrt{2} \\pi f L_s I_d}{V_{LL}} = \\frac{2 \\sqrt{2} \\pi (50) (3.0 \\times 10^{-3}) (1.0 \\times 10^3)}{11 \\times 10^3} = \\frac{300 \\sqrt{2} \\pi}{11000} = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{2} \\pi}{110}$$\nThe numerical value of this term is approximately $0.12109$.\nThe firing angle is $\\alpha = 150^\\circ$, so $\\cos(\\alpha) = \\cos(150^\\circ) = -\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\approx -0.86603$.\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $\\cos(\\alpha+\\mu)$:\n$$\\cos(150^\\circ+\\mu) = -0.86603 - 0.12109 = -0.98712$$\nNow, we find the angle $\\alpha+\\mu$ by taking the arccosine:\n$$150^\\circ+\\mu = \\arccos(-0.98712) \\approx 170.816^\\circ$$\nSolving for the overlap angle $\\mu$:\n$$\\mu = 170.816^\\circ - 150^\\circ = 20.816^\\circ$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\mu = 20.82^\\circ$.\n\nNext, we explain how an increase in $\\mu$ reduces the extinction margin angle $\\gamma$ and threatens commutation stability.\nInverter operation ($\\alpha  90^\\circ$) involves transferring power from the DC side to the AC side. For this process to be stable, each thyristor, after conducting its current pulse, must remain reverse-biased for a sufficient duration to regain its forward voltage blocking capability. This minimum required duration is a characteristic of the device, known as the turn-off time, $t_q$. The angular equivalent of the time available for turn-off is the extinction margin angle, $\\gamma$.\n\nLet's consider the outgoing thyristor T5. Its commutation to T1 ends at $\\theta = \\alpha + \\mu$. At this instant, the current through T5 becomes zero. For T5 to turn off successfully, it must be reverse-biased. The voltage across T5 is $v_{T5} = v_c - v_{P}$, where $v_{P}$ is the potential of the positive DC rail. Immediately after commutation, T1 is conducting, so $v_P \\approx v_a$. Therefore, the voltage across T5 is $v_{T5} \\approx v_c - v_a = -v_{ac}$. For T5 to be reverse-biased, $v_{T5}$ must be negative, which requires $v_{ac}$ to be positive.\nThe commutating voltage is $v_{ac}(\\theta) = \\sqrt{2}V_{LL}\\sin(\\theta)$. This voltage remains positive until $\\theta$ reaches $\\pi$ (or $180^\\circ$), at which point $v_{ac}$ crosses zero and becomes negative, thus forward-biasing thyristor T5 again. If T5 has not regained its blocking capability by this time, it will turn on again, leading to a commutation failure, which is a severe fault condition.\n\nThe extinction margin angle $\\gamma$ is defined as the angular duration from the end of commutation until the commutating voltage naturally reverses. In our angular frame:\n- Commutation ends at: $\\theta_{end} = \\alpha + \\mu$\n- Commutating voltage zero-crossing occurs at: $\\theta_{zc} = \\pi$ (or $180^\\circ$)\nTherefore, the extinction angle $\\gamma$ is given by:\n$$\\gamma = \\theta_{zc} - \\theta_{end} = \\pi - (\\alpha + \\mu)$$\nThis can be rewritten as the fundamental relationship for a line-commutated converter:\n$$\\alpha + \\mu + \\gamma = \\pi \\quad (\\text{or } 180^\\circ)$$\nThis identity clearly shows that for a fixed firing angle $\\alpha$, any increase in the overlap angle $\\mu$ directly leads to a decrease in the extinction margin angle $\\gamma$. Factors that increase $\\mu$ include an increase in the DC current $I_d$ or a decrease in the AC voltage $V_{LL}$.\nCommutation stability requires that the time available for turn-off, $t_{off} = \\gamma/\\omega$, must be greater than the thyristor's required turn-off time $t_q$. That is, $\\gamma > \\omega t_q$. If an increase in $\\mu$ causes $\\gamma$ to fall below this critical value, the converter will suffer a commutation failure. This is a primary operational constraint in inverter mode, necessitating careful control of $\\alpha$ and limiting the operational range of $I_d$ and $V_{LL}$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires determining the firing angle $\\alpha$ for a three-phase, six-pulse fully-controlled converter operating in inverter mode. This requires establishing a relationship between the converter's average DC terminal voltage $V_d$, the firing angle $\\alpha$, and the average DC current $I_d$. A second relationship is provided by the DC-side circuit.\n\nLet us begin by analyzing the DC-side circuit. The converter's DC terminals are connected to a load comprising a series combination of a resistance $R_d$ and a DC source $E_b$. In inverter mode, the converter transfers power from the DC side to the AC side. This means the DC side must contain a power source. The component designated as the back-emf $E_b$ must therefore be the source of power. The converter's DC voltage, $V_d$, will be negative, opposing the current flow and thus acting as a load in the DC circuit (while being a source on the AC side). The current $I_d$ is stated to be positive and continuous, and by convention, it flows from the converter's positive terminal through the external DC circuit. For power to be provided by the DC source $E_b$, its electromotive force must drive the current $I_d$ through the resistance $R_d$ and against the opposing voltage of the converter, $V_d$.\n\nThe Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) equation for the DC loop is therefore:\n$$E_b = V_d + I_d R_d$$\nThe problem specifies the following values: $V_d = -50.0\\,\\text{V}$, $E_b = 220\\,\\text{V}$, and $R_d = 20.0\\,\\Omega$. All values are in base SI units (Volts, Ohms). We can substitute these values into the KVL equation to determine the average DC current $I_d$.\n$$220 = -50.0 + I_d (20.0)$$\nSolving for $I_d$:\n$$I_d (20.0) = 220 + 50.0 = 270$$\n$$I_d = \\frac{270}{20.0} = 13.5\\,\\text{A}$$\nThe average DC current is $I_d = 13.5\\,\\text{A}$.

            "problem": "A three-phase, six-pulse, line-commutated bridge using Silicon Controlled Rectifiers (SCRs) is connected to an ideal three-phase alternating current source with negligible resistive losses and finite source inductance. The direct current side consists of a stiff direct current electromotive force $E_{\\mathrm{d}}  0$ in series with a large smoothing inductance $L_{\\mathrm{d}}$, such that the direct current $I_{\\mathrm{d}}$ is approximately constant over one commutation interval. The bridge is operated in inversion mode with firing angle $\\alpha$ satisfying $\\alpha \\in (\\pi/2,\\pi)$, and commutation occurs by natural reversal of the alternating current phase voltages (line commutation). The extinction margin angle $\\gamma$ is the interval of electrical angle during which an outgoing SCR is reverse-biased and allowed to recover before it would otherwise be forward-biased again by the alternating current system. Stable inversion requires a strictly positive $\\gamma$.\n\nAn ideal freewheeling path is now added directly across the direct current side (that is, an ideal diode is connected in parallel with the series combination of $E_{\\mathrm{d}}$ and $L_{\\mathrm{d}}$), oriented to conduct whenever the converter’s direct current terminal voltage $v_{\\mathrm{dc}}$ tends to become negative with respect to the established direct current polarity. Using Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law, the ideal device characteristics (SCRs require reverse bias and zero current for recovery; the ideal diode conducts for forward bias and blocks for reverse bias), and the definition of direct current power $P_{\\mathrm{dc}} = v_{\\mathrm{dc}} I_{\\mathrm{d}}$, determine how the added freewheeling path affects the commutation margin angle $\\gamma$ and the stability of inversion.

The freewheeling path improves inversion stability by enhancing current continuity on the direct current side, increasing the commutation margin angle $\\gamma$ and making $P_{\\mathrm{dc}}$ more negative.\n\nB. The freewheeling path clamps $v_{\\mathrm{dc}}$ to approximately zero whenever it would be negative, preventing a negative average $v_{\\mathrm{dc}}$ (so $P_{\\mathrm{dc}} \\ge 0$), collapsing the reverse-bias interval of outgoing SCRs so that $\\gamma \\to 0$, and thereby inducing commutation failure and loss of inversion stability.\n\nC.

The freewheeling path increases $\\gamma$ and aids inversion only at low $I_{\\mathrm{d}}$ by maintaining current continuity, but degrades stability at high $I_{\\mathrm{d}}$ due to increased overlap.",
            "solution": "The core of this problem lies in understanding the voltage and current dynamics of a line-commutated converter operating in inversion mode and how a freewheeling diode fundamentally alters these dynamics.\n\n**1. Standard Inverter Operation (Without Freewheeling Path)**\n\nIn a $6$-pulse bridge converter, the average DC voltage $V_{\\mathrm{dc}}$ as a function of the firing angle $\\alpha$ and direct current $I_{\\mathrm{d}}$ is given by:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{dc}} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{2}V_{LL}}{\\pi} \\cos(\\alpha) - \\frac{3\\omega L_s}{\\pi} I_{\\mathrm{d}}$$\nwhere $V_{LL}$ is the RMS line-to-line AC voltage, $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of the AC source, and $L_s$ is the source inductance per phase.\n\nFor inversion mode, power must flow from the DC side to the AC side. The DC power is $P_{\\mathrm{dc}} = V_{\\mathrm{dc}} I_{\\mathrm{d}}$. Since the SCRs only allow current flow in one direction, $I_{\\mathrm{d}}$ is positive ($I_{\\mathrm{d}}  0$). Therefore, for inversion ($P_{\\mathrm{dc}}  0$), the average DC voltage must be negative ($V_{\\mathrm{dc}}  0$). This is achieved by setting the firing angle $\\alpha$ in the range $(\\pi/2, \\pi)$, which makes $\\cos(\\alpha)$ negative.\n\nOn the DC side, Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) for the average values requires that the converter's average voltage balances the DC source EMF: $V_{\\mathrm{dc}} \\approx -E_{\\mathrm{d}}$. This confirms that a negative average voltage is necessary to oppose the positive DC source $E_{\\mathrm{d}}$.\n\nThe instantaneous DC voltage, $v_{\\mathrm{dc}}(t)$, is composed of segments of the AC line-to-line voltages. For $\\alpha  \\pi/2$, the waveform for $v_{\\mathrm{dc}}(t)$ contains significant portions where its value is negative. It is the average of this waveform that results in $V_{\\mathrm{dc}}  0$.\n\nFor stable inversion, the extinction angle $\\gamma$ must be positive. The relation between $\\alpha$, the commutation overlap angle $\\mu$, and $\\gamma$ is:\n$$\\alpha + \\mu + \\gamma = \\pi$$\nA positive $\\gamma$ ensures that an outgoing SCR has sufficient time to be reverse-biased to recover its forward-blocking capability. The reverse-biasing voltage is provided by the AC line-to-line voltages during the intervals that correspond to the negative portions of the $v_{\\mathrm{dc}}(t)$ waveform. If $\\gamma \\le 0$, the SCR will fail to turn off, leading to a short circuit between two AC phases through the converter arms. This is known as commutation failure.\n\n**2. Inverter Operation with an Added Freewheeling Path**\n\nAn ideal freewheeling diode is connected across the DC terminals, oriented to conduct when $v_{\\mathrm{dc}}$ tends to become negative.\n\nThe effect of this diode is to \"clamp\" the instantaneous terminal voltage. Whenever the combination of conducting SCRs would produce a negative $v_{\\mathrm{dc}}$, the freewheeling diode becomes forward-biased and starts to conduct. An ideal diode has zero forward voltage drop, so it short-circuits the DC terminals, forcing $v_{\\mathrm{dc}} = 0$.\n$$v_{\\mathrm{dc}}(t) \\ge 0$$\nThis clamping action has two critical consequences:\n\n- **Impact on Average DC Voltage and Power Flow:** Since the instantaneous voltage $v_{\\mathrm{dc}}(t)$ is now prevented from ever being negative, its average value, $V_{\\mathrm{dc}}$, must be non-negative ($V_{\\mathrm{dc}} \\ge 0$). As established, inversion requires $V_{\\mathrm{dc}}  0$. By forcing $V_{\\mathrm{dc}} \\ge 0$, the freewheeling diode makes sustained inversion impossible. Power cannot be transferred from the DC source to the AC grid, so $P_{\\mathrm{dc}} \\ge 0$.\n\n- **Impact on Commutation and Extinction Angle ($\\gamma$):** The extinction angle $\\gamma$ is the period during which an outgoing SCR is reverse-biased after its current has extinguished. This reverse bias is crucial for the SCR to regain its blocking state. The voltage that reverse-biases the SCR is provided by the AC system during the very intervals when the instantaneous converter voltage $v_{\\mathrm{dc}}(t)$ would naturally be negative.\n\nBy clamping $v_{\\mathrm{dc}}(t)$ to $0$, the freewheeling diode eliminates the negative voltage potential across the converter bridge. This means the source of reverse-biasing voltage for the outgoing SCR is removed. When the freewheeling diode conducts, the DC load current $I_{\\mathrm{d}}$ (maintained by the large inductor $L_{\\mathrm{d}}$) circulates through the diode, and the SCRs are momentarily disconnected from the load current. The reverse bias across the just-turned-off SCR collapses. Therefore, the interval for safe recovery disappears, and the extinction margin angle collapses to zero:\n$$\\gamma \\to 0$$\nWith $\\gamma \\approx 0$, the outgoing SCR will not have sufficient time to recover. As soon as the AC line voltage polarity across it becomes positive again (which happens immediately after the would-be margin interval), it will re-conduct, even without a gate pulse. This creates a line-to-line short circuit through two SCRs, an event known as commutation failure. This inevitably leads to a loss of control and instability.\n\nIn summary, a freewheeling diode, which is beneficial in rectification mode, is fundamentally incompatible with line-commutated inversion mode. It prevents the necessary negative average voltage and eliminates the commutation margin angle, directly causing commutation failure.\n\nBased on this analysis, statement B is the only one that correctly describes the outcome.",
