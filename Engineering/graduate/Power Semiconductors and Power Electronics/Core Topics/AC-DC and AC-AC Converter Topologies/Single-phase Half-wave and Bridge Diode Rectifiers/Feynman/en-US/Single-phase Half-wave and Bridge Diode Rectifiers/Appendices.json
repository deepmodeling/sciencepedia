            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and complete. It describes a canonical circuit in power electronics and requests the derivation of standard performance metrics. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe system under consideration is a single-phase half-wave rectifier. The input source voltage is given as a sinusoidal function of time $t$, $v_{s}(t)=V_{m}\\sin(\\omega t)$, where $V_{m}$ is the peak amplitude and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency. We are given the dimensionless angular time variable $\\theta = \\omega t$, in terms of which the source voltage is $v_{s}(\\theta) = V_{m}\\sin(\\theta)$. The diode is ideal, and the load is purely resistive. The output voltage, $v_{o}(\\theta)$, is the voltage across this resistive load.\n\nFirst, we derive the piecewise expression for the output voltage $v_{o}(\\theta)$ over one fundamental period, $0 \\le \\theta < 2\\pi$. The behavior of the circuit is governed by the state of the ideal diode. An ideal diode acts as a closed switch (zero resistance) when it is forward-biased and as an open switch (infinite resistance) when it is reverse-biased.\n\nIn this series circuit, the diode is forward-biased when the voltage across it would be positive, which corresponds to the source voltage $v_{s}(\\theta)$ being positive. The diode is reverse-biased when $v_{s}(\\theta)$ is negative or zero.\n\nCase 1: Diode is ON (conducting).\nThis occurs when $v_{s}(\\theta) > 0$. For $v_{s}(\\theta) = V_{m}\\sin(\\theta)$, and assuming the peak amplitude $V_{m}$ is positive, this condition simplifies to $\\sin(\\theta)>0$. Over the interval $0 \\le \\theta < 2\\pi$, this is true for $0 < \\theta < \\pi$.\nWhen the diode is conducting, it behaves as a short circuit. The output voltage across the resistive load is therefore equal to the source voltage:\n$v_{o}(\\theta) = v_{s}(\\theta) = V_{m}\\sin(\\theta)$ for $0 < \\theta < \\pi$.\n\nCase 2: Diode is OFF (not conducting).\nThis occurs when $v_{s}(\\theta) \\le 0$, which corresponds to $\\sin(\\theta) \\le 0$. Over the interval $0 \\le \\theta < 2\\pi$, this is true for $\\theta = 0$ and for the entire range $\\pi \\le \\theta < 2\\pi$.\nWhen the diode is not conducting, it behaves as an open circuit. No current flows through the resistive load. By Ohm's Law, the voltage across the resistor is zero:\n$v_{o}(\\theta) = 0$ for $\\pi \\le \\theta < 2\\pi$ and for $\\theta = 0$.\n\nCombining these two cases, we can write a single piecewise expression for the output voltage $v_{o}(\\theta)$ over the period $0 \\le \\theta < 2\\pi$. We can consolidate the boundary points $\\theta=0$ and $\\theta=\\pi$ into the first case, as $V_{m}\\sin(0) = 0$ and $V_{m}\\sin(\\pi) = 0$, ensuring continuity.\nThe resulting expression is:\n$$v_{o}(\\theta) = \\begin{cases} V_{m}\\sin(\\theta) & \\text{for } 0 \\le \\theta \\le \\pi \\\\ 0 & \\text{for } \\pi < \\theta < 2\\pi \\end{cases}$$\n\nNext, we compute the root-mean-square (RMS) value of the output voltage, $V_{o\\mathrm{rms}}$. The RMS value of a periodic function $f(\\theta)$ with period $T_{\\theta}$ is defined as:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{rms}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{T_{\\theta}} \\int_{0}^{T_{\\theta}} [f(\\theta)]^2 \\,d\\theta}$$\nThe output voltage $v_{o}(\\theta)$ is periodic with the same fundamental period as the source, $T_{\\theta} = 2\\pi$. Applying the definition to $v_{o}(\\theta)$:\n$$V_{o\\mathrm{rms}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} [v_{o}(\\theta)]^2 \\,d\\theta}$$\nTo evaluate the integral, we use the piecewise definition of $v_{o}(\\theta)$:\n$$\\int_{0}^{2\\pi} [v_{o}(\\theta)]^2 \\,d\\theta = \\int_{0}^{\\pi} [V_{m}\\sin(\\theta)]^2 \\,d\\theta + \\int_{\\pi}^{2\\pi} [0]^2 \\,d\\theta$$\nThe second integral is zero.

A full-wave bridge rectifier, constructed with ideal diodes, effectively performs an absolute value operation on the input AC source voltage. The input source voltage is given as $v_{s}(t) = V_{m}\\sin(\\omega t)$. The rectifier ensures that the output voltage across the resistive load $R$ is always non-negative.\nFor the positive half-cycle of the source, $0 \\le \\omega t \\le \\pi$, a pair of diodes conducts, and the output voltage is equal to the source voltage, $v_{o}(t) = v_{s}(t)$.\nFor the negative half-cycle of the source, $\\pi < \\omega t < 2\\pi$, the other pair of diodes conducts, inverting the source voltage so that the output voltage is $v_{o}(t) = -v_{s}(t)$.\nThus, the instantaneous output voltage is given by the absolute value of the source voltage:\n$$v_{o}(t) = |v_{s}(t)| = |V_{m}\\sin(\\omega t)| = V_{m}|\\sin(\\omega t)|$$\nwhere $V_{m}$ is a positive amplitude.\n\nNext, we analyze the periodicity of the output voltage $v_{o}(t)$. The source voltage $v_{s}(t)$ is periodic with fundamental period $T_{s} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega}$. The output voltage $v_{o}(t) = V_{m}|\\sin(\\omega t)|$ repeats every half-period of the source. We can verify this by evaluating the function at $t + T_{s}/2 = t + \\pi/\\omega$:\n$$v_{o}(t + \\pi/\\omega) = V_{m}|\\sin(\\omega(t + \\pi/\\omega))| = V_{m}|\\sin(\\omega t + \\pi)| = V_{m}|-\\sin(\\omega t)| = V_{m}|\\sin(\\omega t)| = v_{o}(t)$$\nTherefore, the fundamental period of the output voltage is $T_{o} = \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega}$, which is half the period of the input source voltage.\n\nThe root-mean-square (RMS) value of a periodic function $f(t)$ with period $T$ is defined as:\n$$F_{\\text{RMS}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} [f(t)]^{2} dt}$$\nTo find the RMS value of the output voltage, $V_{o,\\text{RMS}}$, we apply this definition using the function $v_{o}(t)$ and its period $T_{o} = \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega}$.\n$$V_{o,\\text{RMS}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{T_{o}} \\int_{0}^{T_{o}} [v_{o}(t)]^{2} dt} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{\\pi/\\omega} \\int_{0}^{\\pi/\\omega} [V_{m}|\\sin(\\omega t)|]^{2} dt}$$\nWithin the integration interval $t \\in [0, \\pi/\\omega]$, the term $\\omega t$ varies from $0$ to $\\pi$. In this interval, $\\sin(\\omega t) \\ge 0$, so $|\\sin(\\omega t)| = \\sin(\\omega t)$.

The output voltage $v_{o}(t)$ is a periodic function and can be expressed as a sum of a DC component and sinusoidal AC components (harmonics):\n$$v_{o}(t) = a_{0} + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_{n} \\cos(n\\omega_{o}t + \\phi_{n})$$\nwhere $a_{0}$ is the DC (average) value, $A_{n}$ are the amplitudes of the harmonics, $\\phi_{n}$ are their phase shifts, and $\\omega_{o}$ is the fundamental angular frequency of $v_{o}(t)$.\nAs established earlier, the period of the output voltage is $T_{o} = \\frac{\\pi}{\\omega}$. The fundamental angular frequency of the output voltage is therefore:\n$$\\omega_{o} = \\frac{2\\pi}{T_{o}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\pi/\\omega} = 2\\omega$$\nThis angular frequency, $\\omega_{o} = 2\\omega$, is exactly twice the angular frequency of the input source voltage, $\\omega$.\nThe ripple in the output voltage is defined as the AC part of the signal, which is the summation term $\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} A_{n} \\cos(n\\omega_{o}t + \\phi_{n})$. The dominant frequency component of this ripple is its fundamental component, which occurs at $n=1$. The frequency of this component is $\\omega_{o} = 2\\omega$. All other harmonic components of the ripple occur at integer multiples of this frequency (e.g., $4\\omega$, $6\\omega$, etc.).\nTherefore, the spectral content of the rectified voltage $v_{o}(t)$ consists of a DC component and AC components whose lowest frequency is $2\\omega$. This lowest AC frequency is the fundamental frequency of the ripple, which is thus twice the frequency of the AC source.",
