A unique and meaningful solution exists under the specified model.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, unbiased technical language with no subjective elements.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is a standard problem in the analysis of power electronic converters. Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe objective is to find the average and root-mean-square (RMS) current through a single diode in a six-pulse bridge rectifier. Let the angular frequency be $\\omega$, such that one electrical period $T$ corresponds to an angle of $2\\pi$ radians, where $\\theta = \\omega t$.\n\nFirst, we establish the definitions for the average and RMS values of a periodic current $i(\\theta)$ with period $2\\pi$:\nThe average value is given by:\n$$I_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} i(\\theta) \\, d\\theta$$\nThe RMS value is given by:\n$$I_{\\text{RMS}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} i^2(\\theta) \\, d\\theta}$$\n\nNext, we must characterize the current waveform through a single diode, which we denote as $i_D(\\theta)$. The problem states that the DC-side current $I_{dc}$ is strictly constant. By Kirchhoff's current law at the DC output node, the current entering the DC load, $I_{dc}$, is the sum of currents from the conducting diodes. Due to the bridge configuration, at any instant, one diode from the upper group and one from the lower group are conducting. A diode in the upper group conducts if its associated phase voltage is the most positive among the three phases. A diode in the lower group conducts if its phase voltage is the most negative. When a diode is conducting, it carries the entire DC load current $I_{dc}$, because no other diode in its group (upper or lower) is conducting. When a diode is not conducting, its current is zero.\n\nThus, the current waveform $i_D(\\theta)$ for any single diode is a periodic train of rectangular pulses. Each pulse has a magnitude of $I_{dc}$ and a duration equal to the diode's conduction angle, $\\theta_c$.\n\nThe conduction angle $\\theta_c$ for a single diode must be determined. Let us consider a diode in the upper group, for instance, the one connected to phase 'a', $v_a(\\theta)=V_{m}\\sin(\\theta)$. This diode conducts when $v_a$ is greater than both $v_b$ and $v_c$. The crossover points are:\n- $v_a(\\theta) = v_c(\\theta) \\implies V_{m}\\sin(\\theta) = V_{m}\\sin(\\theta - 4\\pi/3)$. This equality holds at $\\theta = \\pi/6$.\n- $v_a(\\theta) = v_b(\\theta) \\implies V_{m}\\sin(\\theta) = V_{m}\\sin(\\theta - 2\\pi/3)$. This equality holds at $\\theta = 5\\pi/6$.\nBetween $\\theta = \\pi/6$ and $\\theta = 5\\pi/6$, the voltage $v_a$ is the highest of the three phase voltages. Therefore, the diode connected to phase 'a' in the upper group conducts throughout this interval. The duration of this interval is the conduction angle $\\theta_c$:\n$$\\theta_c = \\frac{5\\pi}{6} - \\frac{\\pi}{6} = \\frac{4\\pi}{6} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\text{ radians}$$\nBy symmetry, every diode in the rectifier conducts for a duration of $2\\pi/3$ radians, or $1/3$ of the total period. The current waveform $i_D(\\theta)$ for a single diode can be represented over one period, without loss of generality for the calculation, as:\n$$i_D(\\theta) = \\begin{cases} I_{dc} & \\text{for } 0 \\le \\theta < \\theta_c \\\\ 0 & \\text{for } \\theta_c \\le \\theta < 2\\pi \\end{cases}$$\n\nWe can now derive the general expressions for $I_{D,\\text{avg}}$ and $I_{D,\\text{RMS}}$ in terms of $I_{dc}$ and $\\theta_c$.\n\nThe average current through a single diode is:\n$$I_{D,\\text{avg}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} i_D(\\theta) \\, d\\theta = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\theta_c} I_{dc} \\, d\\theta$$\n$$I_{D,\\text{avg}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} [I_{dc}\\theta]_{0}^{\\theta_c} = \\frac{I_{dc}\\theta_c}{2\\pi}$$\n\nThe RMS current through a single diode is found from its mean-square value:\n$$I_{D,\\text{RMS}}^2 = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} i_D^2(\\theta) \\, d\\theta = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\theta_c} I_{dc}^2 \\, d\\theta$$\n$$I_{D,\\text{RMS}}^2 = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} [I_{dc}^2\\theta]_{0}^{\\theta_c} = \\frac{I_{dc}^2\\theta_c}{2\\pi}$$\nTaking the square root gives the RMS current:\n$$I_{D,\\text{RMS}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{I_{dc}^2\\theta_c}{2\\pi}} = I_{dc}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\theta_c}{2\\pi}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the determined value of the conduction angle, $\\theta_c = 2\\pi/3$, into these general expressions to find the final answers in terms of $I_{dc}$.\n\nFor the average current:\n$$I_{D,\\text{avg}} = \\frac{I_{dc}(2\\pi/3)}{2\\pi} = \\frac{I_{dc}}{3}$$\nThis result is intuitive: the total average current $I_{dc}$ is supplied by three diodes in the upper group, so by symmetry, each carries one-third of the total average current over a full cycle.\n\nFor the RMS current:\n$$I_{D,\\text{RMS}} = I_{dc}\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi/3}{2\\pi}} = I_{dc}\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{3}} = \\frac{I_{dc}}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\n\nThe final symbolic expressions for the average and RMS currents through a single diode are $I_{dc}/3$ and $I_{dc}/\\sqrt{3}$, respectively.",

            "solution": "We consider a three-phase six-pulse diode bridge under a balanced sinusoidal source. The Direct Current (DC) current is constant, $I_{d}$, due to a large DC-side inductance. Each AC phase has a series source inductance $L_{s}$. Because the diodes are uncontrolled and ideal, the conduction sequence is determined solely by the instantaneous phase voltages. In space-vector terms, the rectifier selects one of six active states associated with the six vertices of the hexagonal polygon inscribed by the source space vector. Adjacent states are separated by $60^{\\circ}$ electrical angle. \n\nAt a sector boundary, one device in the conducting pair must commutate to its adjacent phase. Due to the source inductances, the current cannot transfer instantaneously; instead, there is an overlap interval of electrical angle $\\mu$ during which two devices on the incoming side and two devices on the outgoing side conduct simultaneously. In the space-vector picture, the effective vector during overlap lies on the hexagon edge connecting the two adjacent vertices (states) and is driven by the line-to-line voltage between the commutating phases.\n\nLet the two commutating phases be denoted by $a$ (outgoing) and $b$ (incoming) on the top diode leg for a representative boundary. During the overlap, the current $i_a$ decreases from $I_d$ to 0, while $i_b$ increases from 0 to $I_d$. The sum of the currents is constant:\n$$\ni_{a}(\\gamma) + i_{b}(\\gamma) = I_{d}.\n$$\nThis implies that $di_a/dt = -di_b/dt$.\n\nApplying Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL) around the commutation loop formed by the two phases, we have $v_b(t) - L_s \\frac{di_b}{dt} = v_a(t) - L_s \\frac{di_a}{dt}$. The line-to-line voltage $v_{ba}(t) = v_b(t) - v_a(t)$ drives the commutation. Substituting the current derivative relationship, the KVL simplifies to:\n$$\nv_{ba}(t) = L_s\\left(\\frac{di_b}{dt} - \\frac{di_a}{dt}\\right) = -2L_s\\frac{di_a}{dt}\n$$\nIntroducing the electrical angle $\\gamma \\equiv \\omega t$, we get $\\frac{di_a}{d\\gamma} = -\\frac{v_{ba}(\\gamma)}{2\\omega L_s}$.\n\nCommutation begins when $v_{ba}$ becomes positive, so we model the driving voltage as a sinusoid starting from zero: $v_{ba}(\\gamma) = V_{\\mathrm{LL,pk}} \\sin(\\gamma)$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for an analysis of the harmonic content of the output voltage of an ideal three-phase half-wave rectifier. The analysis must begin from first principles, explain the origin of the harmonic spectrum, and compute the amplitudes of the first two ripple harmonics.\n\nFirst, we must define the output voltage, $v_{o}(t)$. The rectifier is fed by a balanced three-phase source with line-to-neutral voltages:\n$v_{a}(t) = V_{m}\\sin(\\omega t)$\n$v_{b}(t) = V_{m}\\sin(\\omega t - \\frac{2\\pi}{3})$\n$v_{c}(t) = V_{m}\\sin(\\omega t + \\frac{2\\pi}{3})$\nThe rectifier consists of three ideal diodes, one for each phase, with their cathodes connected to a common output terminal. The return path is the source neutral. In this configuration, the output voltage $v_{o}(t)$ at any instant is equal to the highest of the three-phase voltages, provided that the highest voltage is positive. The output is zero if all phase voltages are negative. Let us determine the conduction intervals for each diode.\nA diode conducts when its anode voltage (the phase voltage) is higher than that of the other two phases. The crossover points are found by equating pairs of phase voltages.\nThe crossover between phase $a$ and phase $c$ occurs when $v_a(t) = v_c(t)$:\n$V_{m}\\sin(\\omega t) = V_{m}\\sin(\\omega t + \\frac{2\\pi}{3})$\nThis implies $\\omega t = \\pi - (\\omega t + \\frac{2\\pi}{3}) + 2k\\pi$ for some integer $k$.\n$2\\omega t = \\frac{\\pi}{3} + 2k\\pi \\implies \\omega t = \\frac{\\pi}{6} + k\\pi$.

The first relevant crossover is at $\\omega t = 5\\pi/6$.\nSo, the diode connected to phase $a$ conducts while $v_a(t)$ is the maximum voltage, which is for $\\omega t \\in [\\pi/6, 5\\pi/6]$. During this interval, $v_o(t) = v_a(t) = V_{m}\\sin(\\omega t)$.\nThe length of this conduction interval is $5\\pi/6 - \\pi/6 = 4\\pi/6 = 2\\pi/3$. The waveform repeats this pattern for each of the other two phases in succession. For example, for $\\omega t \\in [5\\pi/6, 9\\pi/6]$, the output will be $v_o(t) = v_b(t)$.\nThe output waveform $v_o(t)$ is therefore a periodic function composed of $2\\pi/3$-radian segments of the input sinusoids.

This explains why only harmonics at integer multiples of $3f$ appear in the ripple spectrum.\n\nTo compute the amplitudes of the harmonics, we derive the Fourier series for $v_o(t)$.
