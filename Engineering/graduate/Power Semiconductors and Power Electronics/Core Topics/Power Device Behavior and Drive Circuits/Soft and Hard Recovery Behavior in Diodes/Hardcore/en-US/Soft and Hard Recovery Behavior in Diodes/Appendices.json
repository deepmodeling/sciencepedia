All terms are well-defined, and the given parameters are physically realistic. The problem is self-contained as it provides the explicit mathematical model and all necessary values for computation. The tasks are clearly stated applications of integral calculus to the provided physics-based model. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies. The problem is well-posed and objective.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe task is to compute the reverse-recovery charge $Q_{rr}$ and the average current $\\overline{i}$ over the recovery interval $t_{rr} = t_a + t_b$.\n\nFirst, we compute the reverse-recovery charge $Q_{rr}$. The definition is\n$$Q_{rr} = \\int_{0}^{t_{a}+t_{b}} |i(t)|\\,dt$$\nThe current $i(t)$ is defined over the interval $[0, t_a+t_b]$. We analyze its sign.\nFor $t \\in [0, t_{a}]$, the current is $i(t) = -\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{RRM}}}{t_{a}}t$. Since $I_{\\mathrm{RRM}}$, $t_a$, and $t$ are all non-negative, $i(t) \\le 0$.\nFor $t \\in [t_{a}, t_{a}+t_{b}]$, the current is $i(t) = -I_{\\mathrm{RRM}} + \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{RRM}}}{t_{b}}(t-t_a) = I_{\\mathrm{RRM}}\\left(\\frac{t-t_a}{t_b} - 1\\right) = I_{\\mathrm{RRM}}\\left(\\frac{t-(t_a+t_b)}{t_b}\\right)$. Since $t \\le t_a+t_b$, the term $t-(t_a+t_b) \\le 0$. Thus, $i(t) \\le 0$ in this interval as well.\nSince $i(t)$ is non-positive over the entire integration interval $[0, t_a+t_b]$, its absolute value is $|i(t)| = -i(t)$.\nTherefore, the expression for $Q_{rr}$ becomes:\n$$Q_{rr} = \\int_{0}^{t_{a}+t_{b}} -i(t)\\,dt = -\\int_{0}^{t_{a}+t_{b}} i(t)\\,dt$$\nThe integrand $-i(t)$ represents a triangular pulse with its base on the time axis, starting at $(0,0)$, rising linearly to a peak of $I_{\\mathrm{RRM}}$ at $t=t_a$, and then falling linearly back to $0$ at $t=t_a+t_b$. The integral for $Q_{rr}$ is the area under this triangular pulse. The area of a triangle is given by $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$.\nThe base of the triangle is the total recovery time, $t_{rr} = t_a + t_b$. The height of the $|i(t)|$ waveform is the peak current magnitude, $I_{\\mathrm{RRM}}$.\n$$Q_{rr} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (\\text{base}) \\times (\\text{height}) = \\frac{1}{2}(t_a+t_b)I_{\\mathrm{RRM}}$$\nWe can verify this result by performing the integration explicitly:\n$$Q_{rr} = \\int_{0}^{t_{a}} \\left(\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{RRM}}}{t_{a}}t\\right)dt + \\int_{t_{a}}^{t_{a}+t_{b}} \\left(I_{\\mathrm{RRM}} - \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{RRM}}}{t_{b}}(t-t_a)\\right)dt$$\n$$Q_{rr} = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{RRM}}}{t_{a}}\\left[\\frac{t^2}{2}\\right]_{0}^{t_{a}} + I_{\\mathrm{RRM}}\\left[t - \\frac{(t-t_a)^2}{2t_b}\\right]_{t_{a}}^{t_{a}+t_{b}}$$\n$$Q_{rr} = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{RRM}}}{t_{a}}\\left(\\frac{t_a^2}{2}\\right) + I_{\\mathrm{RRM}}\\left( (t_a+t_b) - \\frac{t_b^2}{2t_b} \\right) - I_{\\mathrm{RRM}}\\left( t_a - \\frac{0}{2t_b} \\right)$$\n$$Q_{rr} = \\frac{1}{2}I_{\\mathrm{RRM}}t_a + I_{\\mathrm{RRM}}(t_a+t_b - \\frac{t_b}{2} - t_a) = \\frac{1}{2}I_{\\mathrm{RRM}}t_a + I_{\\mathrm{RRM}}(\\frac{t_b}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2}I_{\\mathrm{RRM}}(t_a+t_b)$$\nThis confirms the geometric calculation. Now we substitute the given values:\n$t_{a} = 55~\\mathrm{ns} = 55 \\times 10^{-9}~\\mathrm{s}$\n$t_{b} = 145~\\mathrm{ns} = 145 \\times 10^{-9}~\\mathrm{s}$\n$I_{\\mathrm{RRM}} = 42~\\mathrm{A}$\nThe total recovery time is $t_{rr} = t_a + t_b = (55 + 145) \\times 10^{-9}~\\mathrm{s} = 200 \\times 10^{-9}~\\mathrm{s}$.\n$$Q_{rr} = \\frac{1}{2}(200 \\times 10^{-9}~\\mathrm{s})(42~\\mathrm{A}) = (100 \\times 10^{-9}~\\mathrm{s})(42~\\mathrm{A}) = 4200 \\times 10^{-9}~\\mathrm{C} = 4.2 \\times 10^{-6}~\\mathrm{C}$$\nThe problem requires the answer in microcoulombs ($\\mu\\text{C}$). Since $1~\\mu\\text{C} = 10^{-6}~\\text{C}$, we have:\n$Q_{rr} = 4.2~\\mu\\text{C}$.\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $Q_{rr} = 4.200~\\mu\\text{C}$.\n\nNext, we compute the signed average current during recovery, $\\overline{i}$. The definition is:\n$$\\overline{i} = \\frac{1}{t_{a}+t_{b}} \\int_{0}^{t_{a}+t_{b}} i(t)\\,dt$$\nThe integral $\\int_{0}^{t_{a}+t_{b}} i(t)\\,dt$ is the signed area of the recovery current waveform. From our analysis for $Q_{rr}$, we know that this integral is equal to $-Q_{rr}$.\n$$\\int_{0}^{t_{a}+t_{b}} i(t)\\,dt = -Q_{rr} = -\\frac{1}{2}(t_a+t_b)I_{\\mathrm{RRM}}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\overline{i}$:\n$$\\overline{i} = \\frac{1}{t_a+t_b} \\left( -\\frac{1}{2}(t_a+t_b)I_{\\mathrm{RRM}} \\right)$$\n$$\\overline{i} = -\\frac{1}{2}I_{\\mathrm{RRM}}$$\nThis result indicates that the average value of the triangular reverse current waveform over its duration is half of its negative peak value.\nSubstituting the given value for $I_{\\mathrm{RRM}}$:\n$$\\overline{i} = -\\frac{1}{2}(42~\\mathrm{A}) = -21~\\mathrm{A}$$\nThe problem requires the answer in amperes, rounded to four significant figures.\n$\\overline{i} = -21.00~\\mathrm{A}$.\n\nThe computed values are $Q_{rr} = 4.200~\\mu\\text{C}$ and $\\overline{i} = -21.00~\\text{A}$.

The softness factor is defined as the ratio of the tail time, $t_b$, to the rise time, $t_a$:\n$$\nS = \\frac{t_b}{t_a}\n$$\nThe analysis begins by calculating $t_a$ and $t_b$ from the provided piecewise model for the reverse recovery current magnitude, $I(t)$.\n\nThe current during the first phase ($0 \\le t \\le t_a$) is given by:\n$$\nI(t) = \\alpha t\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha = 5.0 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{A}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.

The current during the second phase ($t \\ge t_a$) is given by:\n$$\nI(t) = I_{\\mathrm{RRM}}\\, \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t-t_a}{\\tau}\\right)\n$$\nwith the time constant $\\tau = 0.6\\ \\mu\\mathrm{s} = 0.6 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{s}$. The tail time $t_b$ is defined as the duration over which the current decays from $I_{\\mathrm{RRM}}$ (at time $t_a$) to $0.25\\, I_{\\mathrm{RRM}}$. Let $t_c$ be the time at which $I(t_c) = 0.25\\, I_{\\mathrm{RRM}}$. Then, by definition, $t_b = t_c - t_a$.

The softness factor $S$ quantifies the abruptness of current cessation. A very rapid drop in current (small $t_b$ and small $S$) implies a large negative rate of change of current, $dI/dt$. In a practical circuit, this rapid change induces a large voltage spike ($V_L = L_{\\text{stray}} \\cdot dI/dt$) across stray inductances, which can cause component failure and significant electromagnetic interference (EMI).\n\nBased on these physical considerations, the following classification scheme is proposed:\n1.  **Soft Recovery ($S \\ge 1.0$)**: This signifies that the tail time $t_b$ is greater than or equal to the rise time $t_a$. The current decay is gentle, resulting in a low magnitude of $dI/dt$ during the tail phase. This minimizes voltage overshoots and EMI, which is highly desirable in power-switching applications. An $S$-factor of $1$ serves as a natural boundary where the decay process takes at least as long as the initial forced removal process.\n2.  **Hard Recovery ($S < 0.5$)**: This indicates that the tail time is less than half the rise time ($t_b < 0.5 t_a$), signifying a very abrupt or \"snappy\" recovery. The ratio of the peak fall $dI/dt$ to the rise $dI/dt$ is given by $|dI/dt|_{\\text{fall,max}}/|dI/dt|_{\\text{rise}} = (I_{\\text{RRM}}/\\tau)/\\alpha = \\ln(4)/S$. For $S < 0.5$, this ratio exceeds $(\\ln 4)/0.5 \\approx 2.77$, meaning the current snaps off nearly three times faster than it ramped up. This generates high voltage stress and severe EMI, posing a risk to the circuit.\n3.  **Moderate Recovery ($0.5 \\le S < 1.0$)**: This range represents an intermediate behavior. The recovery is faster than the rise but not so abrupt as to be classified as hard. While not ideal, diodes in this range may be acceptable in applications where stray inductance is well-controlled or where some level of voltage overshoot can be managed with snubber circuits.\n\nBased on this classification, the diode under evaluation, with a calculated softness factor of $S \\approx 1.040$, falls into the category of **soft recovery**, since $S \\ge 1.0$. This indicates a favorable characteristic for minimizing switching-induced stress and noise.",

At time $t=0$, the external drive instantaneously reverses the terminal current to a large constant reverse value $-I_{R}$, with $I_{R}$ sufficiently large that carrier extraction dominates over recombination during the initial transient. The diode exhibits soft recovery behavior in the sense that the reverse current decays after the stored charge is removed without large voltage overshoot, and depletion-region charging is negligible compared to quasi-neutral stored charge. The relevant material recombination is governed by Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) statistics with a constant carrier lifetime $\\tau$ under the high-level injection conditions stated.\n\nStarting from fundamental carrier conservation (continuity) and using the charge-control description of a diode, model the transient of the total stored charge $Q(t)$ in the quasi-neutral regions by the relation $dQ/dt = i(t)$ during the fast extraction interval.

The derivation will be based on the charge-control model of the diode.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing the relationship between the terminal current $i(t)$ and the total excess minority carrier charge $Q(t)$ stored in the quasi-neutral regions of a diode is the charge-control equation, also known as the carrier conservation or continuity equation for the total charge:\n$$i(t) = \\frac{dQ(t)}{dt} + \\frac{Q(t)}{\\tau}$$\nHere, $\\frac{dQ(t)}{dt}$ represents the portion of the terminal current that supplies the change in stored charge, and $\\frac{Q(t)}{\\tau}$ represents the recombination current, which accounts for the charge lost per unit time due to Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombination. The parameter $\\tau$ is the high-level injection carrier lifetime.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in two steps: analyzing the initial steady-state condition to determine the stored charge, and then analyzing the reverse recovery transient to find the recovered charge.\n\n**Step 1: Steady-State Forward Conduction ($t < 0$)**\n\nPrior to $t=0$, the diode is in a steady state, conducting a constant forward current $I_F$. In a steady state, the total stored charge is constant. Let this charge be denoted by $Q_{ss}$.\nThe conditions for $t < 0$ are:\n- The terminal current is $i(t) = I_F$.\n- The situation is steady-state, so the stored charge is not changing with time: $\\frac{dQ}{dt} = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these conditions into the general charge-control equation:\n$$I_F = 0 + \\frac{Q_{ss}}{\\tau}$$\nFrom this, we can solve for the steady-state stored charge, which is the initial charge present in the diode at the moment of switching, $Q(0) = Q_{ss}$:\n$$Q_{ss} = I_F \\tau$$\n\n**Step 2: Reverse Recovery Transient ($t \\geq 0$)**\n\nAt $t=0$, the terminal current is instantaneously switched from $I_F$ to a large constant reverse value $-I_R$. The stored charge $Q(t)$ begins to decrease from its initial value $Q_{ss}$ towards zero. This charge is removed through two mechanisms: extraction by the external reverse current $i(t)$ and internal recombination.\n\nThe total reverse-recovered charge, $Q_{rr}$, is defined as the total charge that flows out through the terminals during the entire recovery period. Since the reverse current $i(t)$ is negative during this period, $Q_{rr}$ is given by the integral of the magnitude of the reverse current over time:\n$$Q_{rr} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |i(t)| dt = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} -i(t) dt$$\n\nThe problem provides a critical directive for modeling the transient: \"model the transient of the total stored charge $Q(t)$ by the relation $dQ/dt = i(t)$\". This is a first-order approximation that assumes the extraction of charge by the external current is the dominant mechanism for charge removal, and that the charge lost to internal recombination during the transient is negligible. This assumption is explicitly justified in the problem statement by mentioning a \"sufficiently large\" reverse current $I_R$.\nFollowing this directive, we use the simplified charge-control equation for the transient:\n$$i(t) = \\frac{dQ(t)}{dt}$$\n\nNow, we substitute this simplified expression for $i(t)$ into the integral for $Q_{rr}$:\n$$Q_{rr} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} -\\left(\\frac{dQ(t)}{dt}\\right) dt$$\n\nThis integral can be evaluated directly:\n$$Q_{rr} = -\\int_{0}^{\\infty} dQ = -[Q(t)]_{t=0}^{t=\\infty}$$\n$$Q_{rr} = -(Q(\\infty) - Q(0))$$\nHere, $Q(0)$ is the initial stored charge at the beginning of the transient ($t=0$), and $Q(\\infty)$ is the final stored charge after the recovery process is complete.\n\n- The initial stored charge is the steady-state charge from Step 1: $Q(0) = Q_{ss} = I_F \\tau$.\n- At the end of the recovery process ($t \\to \\infty$), all excess carriers have been removed, so the stored charge is zero: $Q(\\infty) = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these boundary values into the expression for $Q_{rr}$:\n$$Q_{rr} = -(0 - Q_{ss}) = Q_{ss}$$\n\nFinally, by combining the results from both steps, we find the direct relationship between the reverse-recovered charge $Q_{rr}$, the forward current $I_F$, and the carrier lifetime $\\tau$:\n$$Q_{rr} = I_F \\tau$$\n\nThis result represents a fundamental first-order approximation in power electronics, stating that under conditions where recombination during the switching transient is negligible, the total charge recovered from the diode is equal to the charge that was stored in it during forward conduction.",
