This practice  guides you through calculating the total average current demand, which is a sum of the driver's own internal (quiescent) consumption and the dynamic current needed to charge the device gates at a given frequency. Mastering this calculation is essential for correctly sizing the auxiliary bias power supply, ensuring the system has sufficient power with appropriate design margin for reliable operation.",

The driver is powered from a bias rail that also establishes the gate-to-source drive amplitude. Each MOSFET has a specified total gate charge of $Q_{g}=70\\,\\text{nC}$ at a gate drive amplitude of $V_{gg}=12\\,\\text{V}$ when measured under the datasheet’s conditions that include the Miller plateau.

Express your final answer as a current in $\\text{mA}$. Round your answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is subjected to validation to ensure its scientific soundness, consistency, and completeness before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n-   Number of channels: $2$\n-   Circuit topology: Half-bridge with two identical MOSFETs\n-   Total gate charge per MOSFET: $Q_{g} = 70\\,\\text{nC}$\n-   Gate drive amplitude: $V_{gg} = 12\\,\\text{V}$\n-   Switching frequency: $f_{s} = 100\\,\\text{kHz}$\n-   Driver internal quiescent current per channel: $I_{q,ch} = 5\\,\\text{mA}$\n-   Switching scheme: Both channels commutate every switching cycle in a complementary fashion.\n-   Design headroom requirement: $30\\%$\n-   Assumptions to be made:\n    -   Dead-time effects on the gate charge budget are negligible.\n    -   Auxiliary loads on the bias rail are negligible.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n1.  **Scientific or Factual Soundness**: The problem is grounded in the fundamental principles of power electronics, specifically the operation of MOSFET gate drivers. The core relationship between charge, frequency, and average current ($I_{avg} = Q \\cdot f$) is a direct application of the definition of electric current. The provided values for gate charge, switching frequency, and quiescent current are typical and realistic for modern power semiconductor applications.\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It clearly defines all necessary parameters and requests a single, determinable quantity: the minimum bias supply current rating. The inclusion of a design headroom provides a specific and unambiguous constraint.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, objective technical language, free from subjective or ambiguous terms.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. The provided gate drive voltage $V_{gg} = 12\\,\\text{V}$ is the condition under which the gate charge $Q_g$ was measured, which is standard practice. While $V_{gg}$ is not directly used in the average current calculation when $Q_g$ is given, its presence provides context and does not create a contradiction. The instructions to neglect other loads and dead-time effects serve to properly bound the problem.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. A solution will now be derived.\n\nThe total average current drawn from the bias supply, $I_{supply}$, is the sum of two components: the quiescent current, $I_{q,total}$, and the dynamic current, $I_{dyn,total}$.\n$$I_{supply} = I_{q,total} + I_{dyn,total}$$\n\nThe quiescent current is the steady-state current consumed by the driver's internal circuitry, independent of switching activity. The problem specifies a quiescent current of $I_{q,ch} = 5\\,\\text{mA}$ per channel. Since the driver has two channels, the total quiescent current is:\n$$I_{q,total} = 2 \\cdot I_{q,ch} = 2 \\cdot 5\\,\\text{mA} = 10\\,\\text{mA}$$\n\nThe dynamic current arises from the process of charging the MOSFET gates. The fundamental relationship between charge $Q$, time $t$, and average current $I_{avg}$ over a period $T$ is $I_{avg} = \\frac{Q}{T}$. For a process repeating at a frequency $f = \\frac{1}{T}$, the average current is given by:\n$$I_{avg} = Q \\cdot f$$\n\nIn a half-bridge configuration operating in a complementary fashion, both the high-side and low-side MOSFETs are switched during each cycle of period $T_s = \\frac{1}{f_s}$. The bias supply provides the charge to turn each MOSFET on. The charge required to turn on one MOSFET is its total gate charge, $Q_g$. Therefore, in one switching period, the total charge that must be sourced from the bias supply is the sum of the gate charges for the two MOSFETs.\n$$Q_{dyn,cycle} = Q_g + Q_g = 2 \\cdot Q_g$$\nThe total average dynamic current required from the supply is this total charge per cycle multiplied by the switching frequency:\n$$I_{dyn,total} = Q_{dyn,cycle} \\cdot f_s = (2 \\cdot Q_g) \\cdot f_s$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n-   $Q_g = 70\\,\\text{nC} = 70 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{C}$\n-   $f_s = 100\\,\\text{kHz} = 100 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{Hz}$\n\n$$I_{dyn,total} = 2 \\cdot (70 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{C}) \\cdot (100 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{s}^{-1})$$\n$$I_{dyn,total} = 140 \\times 10^{-9} \\cdot 10^5\\,\\text{A} = 140 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{A} = 14 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{A} = 14\\,\\text{mA}$$\n\nThe nominal total average current, $I_{nom}$, is the sum of the total quiescent and dynamic currents:\n$$I_{nom} = I_{q,total} + I_{dyn,total} = 10\\,\\text{mA} + 14\\,\\text{mA} = 24\\,\\text{mA}$$\n\nThe problem requires a minimum supply current rating that includes a $30\\%$ design headroom. Let the headroom factor be $H = 0.30$. The required rating, $I_{rating}$, is calculated as:\n$$I_{rating} = I_{nom} \\cdot (1 + H)$$\n$$I_{rating} = 24\\,\\text{mA} \\cdot (1 + 0.30) = 24\\,\\text{mA} \\cdot 1.30$$\n$$I_{rating} = 31.2\\,\\text{mA}$$\n\nThe result must be rounded to three significant figures.

Express the final answer in amperes. Round your answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the minimum source current a gate driver must supply to charge the gate of a MOSFET. The fundamental physical principle governing this process is the relationship between current ($I$), charge ($Q$), and time ($t$), and the definition of capacitance ($C$). The current is the rate of flow of charge, $I = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}Q}{\\mathrm{d}t}$. For a capacitor, the charge stored is proportional to the voltage across it, $Q = C V$. Combining these, the current required to change the voltage across a capacitor is given by $I = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}(CV)}{\\mathrm{d}t}$. If the capacitance is constant over the voltage swing, this simplifies to $I = C \\frac{\\mathrm{d}V}{\\mathrm{d}t}$.\n\nThe gate of a MOSFET presents a capacitive load to the driver. This load is composed of the gate-to-source capacitance, $C_{gs}$, and the gate-to-drain capacitance, $C_{gd}$. The total current flowing from the driver into the gate terminal, $I_g$, splits to charge these two capacitances.\n\nThe current to charge $C_{gs}$ is $I_{gs} = C_{gs} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{gs}}{\\mathrm{d}t}$, where $V_{gs}$ is the gate-to-source voltage.\nThe current to charge $C_{gd}$ is $I_{gd} = C_{gd} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{gd}}{\\mathrm{d}t}$, where $V_{gd}$ is the gate-to-drain voltage.\nThe total gate current is the sum: $I_g = I_{gs} + I_{gd}$.\n\nThe gate-to-drain voltage $V_{gd}$ can be expressed in terms of the gate-to-source voltage $V_{gs}$ and the drain-to-source voltage $V_{ds}$. Assuming the source terminal is the common reference ($V_s = 0$), we have $V_{gd} = V_g - V_d = V_{gs} - V_{ds}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $I_{gd}$:\n$$I_{gd} = C_{gd} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}(V_{gs} - V_{ds})}{\\mathrm{d}t} = C_{gd} \\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{gs}}{\\mathrm{d}t} - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{ds}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\right)$$\nThe total gate current is therefore:\n$$I_g = C_{gs} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{gs}}{\\mathrm{d}t} + C_{gd} \\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{gs}}{\\mathrm{d}t} - \\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{ds}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\right)$$\n$$I_g = (C_{gs} + C_{gd})\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{gs}}{\\mathrm{d}t} - C_{gd}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{ds}}{\\mathrm{d}t}$$\n\nThe problem provides the input capacitance $C_{iss} = C_{gs} + C_{gd}$ and the reverse transfer capacitance $C_{rss} = C_{gd}$. The values are given for a specific bias condition, $V_{ds}=400\\,\\text{V}$. The equation for the gate current can be written as:\n$$I_g = C_{iss}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{gs}}{\\mathrm{d}t} - C_{rss}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{ds}}{\\mathrm{d}t}$$\n\nA critical piece of information provided in the problem is that the gate voltage swing occurs \"while the drain-to-source voltage remains approximately constant at $V_{ds}=400\\,\\text{V}$\". This condition implies that the rate of change of the drain-to-source voltage is zero during this phase of the turn-on process, i.e., $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{ds}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\approx 0$. This phase corresponds to the turn-on delay and the initial rise of gate voltage to the threshold voltage, before the device begins to conduct significant drain current and the drain voltage starts to fall (which would initiate the Miller plateau region).\n\nApplying the condition $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{ds}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 0$, the equation for the gate current simplifies significantly:\n$$I_g = C_{iss}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{gs}}{\\mathrm{d}t}$$\nThis means the driver current must only charge the total input capacitance $C_{iss}$. The complicating factor of the Miller effect, represented by the term $- C_{rss}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{ds}}{\\mathrm{d}t}$, is not present in this phase of switching.\n\nThe problem requires a gate-to-source voltage swing, $\\Delta V_{gs}$, from $0\\,\\text{V}$ to $10\\,\\text{V}$ in a rise time, $t_r$, of $20\\,\\text{ns}$. We can model this as a linear ramp, for which the rate of voltage change is constant:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{gs}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\Delta V_{gs}}{t_r} = \\frac{10\\,\\text{V} - 0\\,\\text{V}}{20\\,\\text{ns}} = \\frac{10\\,\\text{V}}{20 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{s}}$$\nThe minimum required source current is the constant current needed to achieve this linear ramp. We use the value of $C_{iss}$ provided at the specified operating voltage: $C_{iss} = 3\\,\\text{nF} = 3 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{F}$.\n\nSubstituting the values into the simplified current equation:\n$$I_g = (3 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{F}) \\times \\left( \\frac{10\\,\\text{V}}{20 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{s}} \\right)$$\n$$I_g = \\frac{3 \\times 10^{-9} \\times 10}{20 \\times 10^{-9}}\\,\\text{A}$$\n$$I_g = \\frac{30}{20}\\,\\text{A}$$\n$$I_g = 1.5\\,\\text{A}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The calculated value $1.5$ can be written as $1.50$ to meet this requirement.\nThe information about $C_{rss}$ is consistent with the definition $C_{iss} = C_{gs} + C_{gd}$, but its value is not directly needed for the calculation under the specified condition that $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{ds}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 0$.\nThe minimum source current that the gate driver must be able to supply is therefore $1.50\\,\\text{A}$.",
