The concepts of dead-time, body diode conduction, and conduction losses are fundamental principles. The provided values for current, resistance, voltage, and frequency are realistic for contemporary WBG devices. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information and assumptions (like constant current during the short dead-time interval) required to arrive at a unique, meaningful solution. The problem is objective and uses precise technical language. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. The solution will proceed.\n\n**Detailed Solution**\nThe average additional power loss is the total additional energy dissipated per switching period, divided by the duration of that period. The additional energy arises from the fact that during the extended dead-time, the load current conducts through a different path than it would have if the switch had been on.\n\nNormally, after the dead-time, the load current $I_{L}$ would flow through the channel of the turned-on MOSFET. The instantaneous power dissipated in this state is given by:\n$$P_{\\text{on}} = I_{L}^{2} R_{\\text{ds,on}}$$\nThis represents the power that would have been dissipated if the MOSFET channel were conducting during the interval $\\Delta t$.\n\nHowever, due to the dead-time increment $\\Delta t$, the load current $I_{L}$ is forced to freewheel through the body diode of the complementary MOSFET in the inverter leg. The instantaneous power dissipated in this state is given by:\n$$P_{D} = V_{D} I_{L}$$\nwhere $V_{D}$ is the forward voltage drop across the body diode at the current $I_{L}$.\n\nThe problem states that these power levels can be considered constant over the short duration of the dead-time increment. The additional instantaneous power dissipation during this interval $\\Delta t$ is the difference between the power dissipated in the body diode and the power that would have been dissipated in the MOSFET channel:\n$$\\Delta P = P_{D} - P_{\\text{on}} = V_{D} I_{L} - I_{L}^{2} R_{\\text{ds,on}}$$\n\nThis increase in power dissipation occurs for a duration of $\\Delta t$. Therefore, the additional energy dissipated per commutation event is:\n$$\\Delta E_{\\text{comm}} = \\Delta P \\cdot \\Delta t = (V_{D} I_{L} - I_{L}^{2} R_{\\text{ds,on}}) \\Delta t$$\n\nThe problem specifies that this dead-time increment $\\Delta t$ is applied at both commutation edges (turn-on and turn-off transitions of the half-bridge) within each switching period. Thus, the total additional energy dissipated per switching period, $\\Delta E_{\\text{period}}$, is twice the additional energy per commutation:\n$$\\Delta E_{\\text{period}} = 2 \\cdot \\Delta E_{\\text{comm}} = 2 (V_{D} I_{L} - I_{L}^{2} R_{\\text{ds,on}}) \\Delta t$$\n\nThe average additional power loss, $\\Delta P_{\\text{avg}}$, is this total additional energy per period divided by the switching period, $T_{s}$. Since the switching frequency is $f_{s} = 1/T_{s}$, the average additional power loss is:\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{\\Delta E_{\\text{period}}}{T_{s}} = \\Delta E_{\\text{period}} \\cdot f_{s} = 2 f_{s} \\Delta t (V_{D} I_{L} - I_{L}^{2} R_{\\text{ds,on}})$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given values into this expression:\n- $I_{L} = 30\\,\\text{A}$\n- $R_{\\text{ds,on}} = 15\\,\\text{m}\\Omega = 15 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\Omega$\n- $V_{D} = 2.6\\,\\text{V}$\n- $f_{s} = 200\\,\\text{kHz} = 2 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\text{Hz}$\n- $\\Delta t = 50\\,\\text{ns} = 50 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{s} = 5 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\text{s}$\n\nFirst, calculate the power dissipated in each conduction path:\nPower in the MOSFET channel:\n$$P_{\\text{on}} = (30\\,\\text{A})^{2} \\cdot (15 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\Omega) = 900 \\cdot 0.015\\,\\text{W} = 13.5\\,\\text{W}$$\nPower in the body diode:\n$$P_{D} = (2.6\\,\\text{V}) \\cdot (30\\,\\text{A}) = 78\\,\\text{W}$$\n\nThe difference in instantaneous power is:\n$$\\Delta P = P_{D} - P_{\\text{on}} = 78\\,\\text{W} - 13.5\\,\\text{W} = 64.5\\,\\text{W}$$\n\nNow, calculate the average additional power loss:\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{avg}} = 2 \\cdot f_{s} \\cdot \\Delta t \\cdot \\Delta P$$\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{avg}} = 2 \\cdot (2 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\text{Hz}) \\cdot (5 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\text{s}) \\cdot (64.5\\,\\text{W})$$\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{avg}} = (2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 5) \\times 10^{(5-8)} \\cdot 64.5\\,\\text{W}$$\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{avg}} = 20 \\times 10^{-3} \\cdot 64.5\\,\\text{W}$$\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{avg}} = 0.02 \\cdot 64.5\\,\\text{W}$$\n$$\\Delta P_{\\text{avg}} = 1.29\\,\\text{W}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in watts and rounded to four significant figures.
