The charge consumed by the high-side driver's quiescent current, $Q_{\\mathrm{HS}}$.\n4.  The charge lost to leakage from the bootstrap network (diode and capacitor), $Q_{\\mathrm{leak}}$.\n5.  The charge lost to the GaN HEMT's gate leakage current, $Q_{g,\\mathrm{leak}}$.\n\nLet's calculate each charge component.\n1.  **Gate Charge**: This is provided directly.\n    $$Q_g = 12\\,\\mathrm{nC}$$\n\n2.  **Miller Charge**: This is the displacement charge required to swing the voltage across the Miller capacitance $C_{gd}$ by $V_{\\mathrm{SW}}$.\n    $$Q_{\\mathrm{miller}} = C_{gd} \\times V_{\\mathrm{SW}} = (30 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F}) \\times (400\\,\\mathrm{V}) = 12000 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{C} = 12 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{C} = 12\\,\\mathrm{nC}$$\n    Both $Q_g$ and $Q_{\\mathrm{miller}}$ represent charge delivered primarily at the beginning of the on-time, during the turn-on transition.\n\n3.  **Charges due to constant currents**: The remaining charge components are due to steady currents flowing for the entire duration $T_{on}$. We can sum these currents first.\n    $$I_{\\mathrm{HS}} = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{mA} = 3000\\,\\mathrm{\\mu A}$$\n    $$I_{\\mathrm{leak}} = 50\\,\\mathrm{\\mu A}$$\n    $$I_{g,\\mathrm{leak}} = 100\\,\\mathrm{\\mu A}$$\n    The total steady-state current $I_{\\mathrm{q,total}}$ drawn from the capacitor is:\n    $$I_{\\mathrm{q,total}} = I_{\\mathrm{HS}} + I_{\\mathrm{leak}} + I_{g,\\mathrm{leak}} = 3000\\,\\mathrm{\\mu A} + 50\\,\\mathrm{\\mu A} + 100\\,\\mathrm{\\mu A} = 3150\\,\\mathrm{\\mu A} = 3.15 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{A}$$\n    The total charge consumed by these currents over the interval $T_{on}$ is $Q_{\\mathrm{q,total}}$:\n    $$Q_{\\mathrm{q,total}} = I_{\\mathrm{q,total}} \\times T_{on} = (3.15 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{A}) \\times (3.5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}) = 11.025 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{C} = 11.025\\,\\mathrm{nC}$$\n\nThe total charge $\\Delta Q_{\\mathrm{total}}$ is the sum of all these components:\n$$\\Delta Q_{\\mathrm{total}} = Q_g + Q_{\\mathrm{miller}} + Q_{\\mathrm{q,total}}$$\n$$\\Delta Q_{\\mathrm{total}} = 12\\,\\mathrm{nC} + 12\\,\\mathrm{nC} + 11.025\\,\\mathrm{nC} = 35.025\\,\\mathrm{nC}$$\n\nFinally, we calculate the minimum bootstrap capacitance $C_{\\mathrm{BST,min}}$ using the maximum allowed voltage droop $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{BST,max}} = 0.30\\,\\mathrm{V}$:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{BST,min}} = \\frac{\\Delta Q_{\\mathrm{total}}}{\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{BST,max}}} = \\frac{35.025 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{C}}{0.30\\,\\mathrm{V}}$$\n$$C_{\\mathrm{BST,min}} = 116.75 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{F} = 0.11675 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{F} = 0.11675\\,\\mathrm{\\mu F}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed in $\\mathrm{\\mu F}$ and rounded to four significant figures.\n$$C_{\\mathrm{BST,min}} \\approx 0.1168\\,\\mathrm{\\mu F}$$",
