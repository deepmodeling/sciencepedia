            "problem": "An isolated gate-drive transformer (GDT) is used to deliver unipolar rectangular gate pulses to a power semiconductor at a repetitive rate. The transformer has a primary with $N_{p}$ turns wound on a ferrite core of uniform cross-sectional area $A_{c}$. The magnetizing flux density $B(t)$ in the core is driven by the applied primary voltage according to electromagnetic induction. A reset network applies a constant reset voltage of magnitude $V_{\\text{reset}}$ across the primary during the interval between successive gate pulses, with polarity chosen to reduce $B(t)$ back toward its initial value.\n\nAssume the following:\n- The core is ideal (no hysteresis or residual flux), and leakage inductance and winding resistance are negligible.\n- The gate pulse applied to the primary is unipolar and rectangular, and the resets apply a constant voltage of opposite polarity during the remaining portion of the period.\n- The initial core flux density at the start of each cycle is near zero.\n- The target maximum flux density excursion per gate pulse is limited to $\\Delta B_{\\max}$.\n\nThe transformer and drive operate with:\n- Primary turns $N_{p} = 26$,\n- Core cross-sectional area $A_{c} = 1.8 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}$,\n- Repetitive frequency $f_{\\text{rep}} = 250\\ \\mathrm{kHz}$,\n- Gate pulse duty ratio $D_{\\text{on}} = 0.35$,\n- Target maximum flux density excursion $\\Delta B_{\\max} = 0.18\\ \\mathrm{T}$.\n\nStarting from Faraday’s law of electromagnetic induction and the definition of flux density, derive the condition that the volt–second balance over one period must satisfy to avoid flux walk, and determine the minimum magnitude of the reset voltage $V_{\\text{reset,min}}$ needed to return the core flux density to near zero before the next pulse, assuming the worst-case positive excursion equals $\\Delta B_{\\max}$.

            "solution": "The problem is evaluated to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary data are provided, the parameters are physically realistic for a gate-drive transformer application, and the problem statement is free from ambiguity or contradiction. It represents a standard, non-trivial problem in power electronics. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a full solution is provided below.\n\nThe solution begins with Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, which relates the voltage $v(t)$ across a winding of $N_p$ turns to the rate of change of magnetic flux $\\Phi(t)$ through the core:\n$$v(t) = N_p \\frac{d\\Phi(t)}{dt}$$\nThe magnetic flux $\\Phi(t)$ is the product of the magnetic flux density $B(t)$ and the core's cross-sectional area $A_c$, assuming uniform flux distribution. The problem states the core has a uniform cross-sectional area $A_c$.\n$$\\Phi(t) = B(t) A_c$$\nSubstituting the expression for flux into Faraday's law gives the relationship between the primary voltage and the rate of change of flux density:\n$$v(t) = N_p A_c \\frac{dB(t)}{dt}$$\nTo find the change in flux density, $\\Delta B$, over a time interval from $t_1$ to $t_2$, we integrate the above equation:\n$$\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} v(t) dt = \\int_{B(t_1)}^{B(t_2)} N_p A_c dB = N_p A_c [B(t_2) - B(t_1)]$$\nThis leads to the fundamental relationship for the change in flux density:\n$$\\Delta B = B(t_2) - B(t_1) = \\frac{1}{N_p A_c} \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} v(t) dt$$\nThe term $\\int v(t) dt$ is known as the volt-second product applied to the winding.\n\nFor a transformer operating in a repetitive steady state, the net change in flux density over one full period must be zero to prevent the core from \"walking\" into saturation. This is the principle of volt-second balance. If the net change were non-zero, the flux density would incrementally increase or decrease with each cycle, eventually leading to saturation and transformer failure.\nThe condition for avoiding flux walk is therefore:\n$$\\Delta B_{\\text{cycle}} = \\frac{1}{N_p A_c} \\int_{0}^{T} v(t) dt = 0$$\nwhere $T = 1/f_{\\text{rep}}$ is the period of one full cycle. This implies that the total volt-second product applied to the primary over one cycle must be zero:\n$$\\int_{0}^{T} v(t) dt = 0$$\nThis is the required condition for volt-second balance.\n\nThe operating cycle consists of two intervals:\n1.  The \"on-time\", $t_{\\text{on}}$, during which the gate pulse is applied. The duration is $t_{\\text{on}} = D_{\\text{on}} T$. During this time, a constant positive voltage, which we can call $V_{\\text{on}}$, is applied.\n2.  The \"off-time\", $t_{\\text{off}}$, during which the core is reset. The duration is $t_{\\text{off}} = T - t_{\\text{on}} = (1 - D_{\\text{on}})T$. A constant negative reset voltage of magnitude $V_{\\text{reset}}$ is applied, so the voltage is $-V_{\\text{reset}}$.\n\nThe integral for volt-second balance can be split into these two parts:\n$$\\int_{0}^{t_{\\text{on}}} V_{\\text{on}} dt + \\int_{t_{\\text{on}}}^{T} (-V_{\\text{reset}}) dt = 0$$\nSince the voltages are constant over their respective intervals, the integration is straightforward:\n$$V_{\\text{on}} t_{\\text{on}} - V_{\\text{reset}} t_{\\text{off}} = 0 \\implies V_{\\text{on}} t_{\\text{on}} = V_{\\text{reset}} t_{\\text{off}}$$\nThis expresses the volt-second balance for this specific application.\n\nThe problem states that the maximum flux density excursion per pulse, $\\Delta B_{\\max}$, occurs during the on-time as the flux density increases from its initial value (assumed near zero). The change in flux density during the on-time is:\n$$\\Delta B_{\\text{on}} = \\frac{1}{N_p A_c} \\int_{0}^{t_{\\text{on}}} V_{\\text{on}} dt = \\frac{V_{\\text{on}} t_{\\text{on}}}{N_p A_c}$$\nSetting this excursion to the maximum allowed value, $\\Delta B_{\\max}$:\n$$V_{\\text{on}} t_{\\text{on}} = N_p A_c \\Delta B_{\\max}$$\nTo return the core flux to its initial state, the flux density must be decreased by the same amount, $\\Delta B_{\\max}$, during the off-time. This requires a reset volt-second product of equal magnitude. The minimum reset voltage magnitude, $V_{\\text{reset,min}}$, is the voltage required to achieve this reset within the available off-time, $t_{\\text{off}}$:\n$$V_{\\text{reset,min}} t_{\\text{off}} = N_p A_c \\Delta B_{\\max}$$\nSolving for $V_{\\text{reset,min}}$:\n$$V_{\\text{reset,min}} = \\frac{N_p A_c \\Delta B_{\\max}}{t_{\\text{off}}}$$\nWe can express $t_{\\text{off}}$ in terms of the given parameters: $t_{\\text{off}} = (1 - D_{\\text{on}})T = \\frac{1 - D_{\\text{on}}}{f_{\\text{rep}}}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $V_{\\text{reset,min}}$ yields the final symbolic formula:\n$$V_{\\text{reset,min}} = \\frac{N_p A_c \\Delta B_{\\max} f_{\\text{rep}}}{1 - D_{\\text{on}}}$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values provided:\n- $N_{p} = 26$\n- $A_{c} = 1.8 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}$\n- $f_{\\text{rep}} = 250\\ \\mathrm{kHz} = 2.5 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $D_{\\text{on}} = 0.35$\n- $\\Delta B_{\\max} = 0.18\\ \\mathrm{T}$\n\n$$V_{\\text{reset,min}} = \\frac{(26) \\cdot (1.8 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}) \\cdot (0.18\\ \\mathrm{T}) \\cdot (2.5 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1})}{1 - 0.35}$$\n$$V_{\\text{reset,min}} = \\frac{(26) \\cdot (1.8 \\times 10^{-5}) \\cdot (0.18) \\cdot (2.5 \\times 10^5)}{0.65}\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\nFirst, we calculate the numerator:\nNumerator $= 26 \\times 1.8 \\times 0.18 \\times 2.5 \\times 10^{-5} \\times 10^{5} = 26 \\times 1.8 \\times 0.18 \\times 2.5 = 21.06$\nNow, we perform the division:\n$$V_{\\text{reset,min}} = \\frac{21.06}{0.65} \\approx 32.4\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\nThe calculation yields $32.4$. The problem requires rounding to three significant figures, which is already satisfied.\n$$V_{\\text{reset,min}} = 32.4\\ \\mathrm{V}$$",

Numerical Values (Interleaved)**\nUsing the parameters, with $\\delta = 0.050 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}$:\n$$L_{\\ell, \\text{inter}} = \\frac{1}{2} (4\\pi \\times 10^{-7}) \\frac{(12.0 \\times 10^{-3}) (0.050 \\times 10^{-3})}{4.0 \\times 10^{-3}} = 3.0\\pi \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{H} \\approx 9.425 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{H}$$\n$$C_{iw, \\text{inter}} = 2 (8.854 \\times 10^{-12}) (3.40) \\frac{(4.0 \\times 10^{-3}) (12.0 \\times 10^{-3})}{0.050 \\times 10^{-3}} \\approx 5.780 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{F}$$\n\n**3. Ratio of Resonance Frequencies**\n\nThe parasitic resonance frequency is given by $f = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sqrt{L_{\\ell} C_{iw}}}$. The requested ratio $R$ is:\n$$R = \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{interleaved}}}{f_{\\mathrm{non\\text{-}interleaved}}} = \\frac{1/(2\\pi\\sqrt{L_{\\ell, \\text{inter}} C_{iw, \\text{inter}}})}{1/(2\\pi\\sqrt{L_{\\ell, \\text{non-int}} C_{iw, \\text{non-int}}})} = \\sqrt{\\frac{L_{\\ell, \\text{non-int}} C_{iw, \\text{non-int}}}{L_{\\ell, \\text{inter}} C_{iw, \\text{inter}}}}$$\nWe now compute the product $L_{\\ell}C_{iw}$ for each configuration using the derived symbolic expressions.\n\nFor the non-interleaved configuration:\n$$L_{\\ell, \\text{non-int}} C_{iw, \\text{non-int}} = \\left(\\mu_0 \\frac{l D}{w}\\right) \\left(\\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r \\frac{w l}{D}\\right) = \\mu_0 \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r l^2$$\n\nFor the interleaved configuration:\n$$L_{\\ell, \\text{inter}} C_{iw, \\text{inter}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_0 \\frac{l \\delta}{w}\\right) \\left(2 \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r \\frac{w l}{\\delta}\\right) = \\mu_0 \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r l^2$$\n\nThe products are analytically identical. This is because the geometric dependencies on the transverse dimensions ($w$, $D$, $\\delta$) cancel out in the $LC$ product for both topologies under the given idealizations. The product simplifies to a term dependent only on the material constants ($\\mu_0, \\varepsilon_0, \\varepsilon_r$) and the overlap length ($l$).\n\nSubstituting these identical results into the expression for the ratio $R$:\n$$R = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_0 \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r l^2}{\\mu_0 \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r l^2}} = \\sqrt{1} = 1$$\nThe ratio $R$ is analytically equal to $1$. Expressing this result as a decimal rounded to four significant figures gives $1.000$.",
