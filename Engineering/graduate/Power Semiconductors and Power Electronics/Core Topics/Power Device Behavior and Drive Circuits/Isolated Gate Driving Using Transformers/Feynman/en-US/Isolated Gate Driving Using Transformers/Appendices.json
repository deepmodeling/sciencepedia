            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. All necessary data and conditions for a unique and meaningful solution are provided. The problem asks for a derivation from first principles, which is a standard and rigorous approach in physics and engineering.\n\nThe problem requires a two-part calculation: first, the energy drawn from the driver supply during a single turn-on event, and second, the average power required to sustain the gate drive at a given switching frequency. We will address each part sequentially, adhering strictly to first principles.\n\n**Part 1: Energy Drawn During a Turn-On Transition**\n\nWe begin with the fundamental definition of electrical energy. The instantaneous power $p(t)$ delivered by a voltage source $v(t)$ supplying a current $i(t)$ is given by $p(t) = v(t) i(t)$. The total energy $E$ delivered over a time interval from $t_0$ to $t_1$ is the integral of this instantaneous power:\n$$E = \\int_{t_0}^{t_1} p(t) \\, dt = \\int_{t_0}^{t_1} v(t) i(t) \\, dt$$\nIn this problem, the gate driver supply acts as a voltage source. During the turn-on transition, it applies a constant voltage of $V_{\\mathrm{GE}} = 15\\,\\mathrm{V}$ to charge the IGBT gate. The current flowing from the driver is the gate current, $i_g(t)$. The energy drawn from the driver supply, $E_{\\text{on}}$, during this turn-on interval is therefore:\n$$E_{\\text{on}} = \\int_{\\text{turn-on}} V_{\\mathrm{GE}} \\cdot i_g(t) \\, dt$$\nSince $V_{\\mathrm{GE}}$ is the constant supply voltage, it can be factored out of the integral:\n$$E_{\\text{on}} = V_{\\mathrm{GE}} \\int_{\\text{turn-on}} i_g(t) \\, dt$$\nThe integral of current over time, $\\int i_g(t) \\, dt$, is the definition of the total charge transferred. The problem states that the total gate charge required to raise the gate-emitter voltage from $0$ to $15\\,\\mathrm{V}$ is $Q_g = 1.45\\,\\mu\\mathrm{C}$. Thus, the integral evaluates to $Q_g$:\n$$\\int_{\\text{turn-on}} i_g(t) \\, dt = Q_g$$\nSubstituting this back into the energy equation, we find the energy drawn from the supply for a single turn-on event:\n$$E_{\\text{on}} = V_{\\mathrm{GE}} \\cdot Q_g$$\nThis expression is derived from first principles. It is important to note that this is the energy drawn from the supply, not the energy stored in the gate capacitance. The energy stored in the gate capacitance at the end of the transition is $E_{\\text{stored}} = \\frac{1}{2}Q_g V_{\\mathrm{GE}}$, with the other half of the energy from the supply having been dissipated as heat in the gate's series resistance during C-R charging.\n\nNow, we substitute the given values:\n$V_{\\mathrm{GE}} = 15\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n$Q_g = 1.45\\,\\mu\\mathrm{C} = 1.45 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n\nThe energy is:\n$$E_{\\text{on}} = (15\\,\\mathrm{V}) \\times (1.45 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{C}) = 21.75 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{J}$$\nThe problem requests the answer in microjoules ($\\mu\\mathrm{J}$).\n$$E_{\\text{on}} = 21.75\\,\\mu\\mathrm{J}$$\nThis value is already at four significant figures.\n\n**Part 2: Average Power Delivered Through the Transformer**\n\nNext, we determine the average power, $P_{\\text{avg}}$. Average power is defined as the total energy, $E_{\\text{cycle}}$, consumed per cycle divided by the duration of one cycle, $T_{\\text{sw}}$, or equivalently, multiplied by the switching frequency, $f_{\\text{sw}} = 1/T_{\\text{sw}}$.\n$$P_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{cycle}}}{T_{\\text{sw}}} = E_{\\text{cycle}} \\cdot f_{\\text{sw}}$$\nTo find $E_{\\text{cycle}}$, we must account for all energy drawn from the driver supply over one complete switching cycle. A cycle consists of turn-on, on-state, turn-off, and off-state.\n1.  **Turn-on:** Energy $E_{\\text{on}} = V_{\\mathrm{GE}} Q_g$ is drawn from the supply.\n2.  **On-state:** The gate is fully charged. In an ideal model, the IGBT gate is an insulator, so the steady-state gate current is zero. Thus, no power is drawn from the supply.\n3.  **Turn-off:** The charge $Q_g$ is removed from the gate, and the stored energy is dissipated in the turn-off path. This energy is not drawn from the supply during this phase.\n4.  **Off-state:** The gate voltage is zero, so no power is drawn.\n\nTherefore, the only energy drawn from the supply during one complete switching cycle is the energy required for the turn-on transition.\n$$E_{\\text{cycle}} = E_{\\text{on}} = V_{\\mathrm{GE}} \\cdot Q_g$$\nThe average power is then:\n$$P_{\\text{avg}} = (V_{\\mathrm{GE}} \\cdot Q_g) \\cdot f_{\\text{sw}}$$\nThe problem specifies ideal driver and transformer, meaning the power delivered through the transformer is equal to the power drawn from the driver supply.\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n$E_{\\text{cycle}} = 21.75 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{J}$\n$f_{\\text{sw}} = 37\\,\\mathrm{kHz} = 37 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nThe average power is:\n$$P_{\\text{avg}} = (21.75 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{J}) \\times (37 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) = 804.75 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{W} = 0.80475\\,\\mathrm{W}$$\nRounding this result to four significant figures, we get:\n$$P_{\\text{avg}} = 0.8048\\,\\mathrm{W}$$\n\nThe requested values are the energy per turn-on transition in microjoules and the average power in watts, both rounded to four significant figures.\nEnergy: $21.75\\,\\mu\\mathrm{J}$\nPower: $0.8048\\,\\mathrm{W}$",

All necessary data are provided, the parameters are physically realistic for a gate-drive transformer application, and the problem statement is free from ambiguity or contradiction. It represents a standard, non-trivial problem in power electronics. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a full solution is provided below.\n\nThe solution begins with Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, which relates the voltage $v(t)$ across a winding of $N_p$ turns to the rate of change of magnetic flux $\\Phi(t)$ through the core:\n$$v(t) = N_p \\frac{d\\Phi(t)}{dt}$$\nThe magnetic flux $\\Phi(t)$ is the product of the magnetic flux density $B(t)$ and the core's cross-sectional area $A_c$, assuming uniform flux distribution. The problem states the core has a uniform cross-sectional area $A_c$.\n$$\\Phi(t) = B(t) A_c$$\nSubstituting the expression for flux into Faraday's law gives the relationship between the primary voltage and the rate of change of flux density:\n$$v(t) = N_p A_c \\frac{dB(t)}{dt}$$\nTo find the change in flux density, $\\Delta B$, over a time interval from $t_1$ to $t_2$, we integrate the above equation:\n$$\\int_{t_1}^{t_2} v(t) dt = \\int_{B(t_1)}^{B(t_2)} N_p A_c dB = N_p A_c [B(t_2) - B(t_1)]$$\nThis leads to the fundamental relationship for the change in flux density:\n$$\\Delta B = B(t_2) - B(t_1) = \\frac{1}{N_p A_c} \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} v(t) dt$$\nThe term $\\int v(t) dt$ is known as the volt-second product applied to the winding.\n\nFor a transformer operating in a repetitive steady state, the net change in flux density over one full period must be zero to prevent the core from \"walking\" into saturation. This is the principle of volt-second balance. If the net change were non-zero, the flux density would incrementally increase or decrease with each cycle, eventually leading to saturation and transformer failure.\nThe condition for avoiding flux walk is therefore:\n$$\\Delta B_{\\text{cycle}} = \\frac{1}{N_p A_c} \\int_{0}^{T} v(t) dt = 0$$\nwhere $T = 1/f_{\\text{rep}}$ is the period of one full cycle. This implies that the total volt-second product applied to the primary over one cycle must be zero:\n$$\\int_{0}^{T} v(t) dt = 0$$\nThis is the required condition for volt-second balance.\n\nThe operating cycle consists of two intervals:\n1.  The \"on-time\", $t_{\\text{on}}$, during which the gate pulse is applied. The duration is $t_{\\text{on}} = D_{\\text{on}} T$. During this time, a constant positive voltage, which we can call $V_{\\text{on}}$, is applied.\n2.  The \"off-time\", $t_{\\text{off}}$, during which the core is reset. The duration is $t_{\\text{off}} = T - t_{\\text{on}} = (1 - D_{\\text{on}})T$. A constant negative reset voltage of magnitude $V_{\\text{reset}}$ is applied, so the voltage is $-V_{\\text{reset}}$.\n\nThe integral for volt-second balance can be split into these two parts:\n$$\\int_{0}^{t_{\\text{on}}} V_{\\text{on}} dt + \\int_{t_{\\text{on}}}^{T} (-V_{\\text{reset}}) dt = 0$$\nSince the voltages are constant over their respective intervals, the integration is straightforward:\n$$V_{\\text{on}} t_{\\text{on}} - V_{\\text{reset}} t_{\\text{off}} = 0 \\implies V_{\\text{on}} t_{\\text{on}} = V_{\\text{reset}} t_{\\text{off}}$$\nThis expresses the volt-second balance for this specific application.\n\nThe problem states that the maximum flux density excursion per pulse, $\\Delta B_{\\max}$, occurs during the on-time as the flux density increases from its initial value (assumed near zero). The change in flux density during the on-time is:\n$$\\Delta B_{\\text{on}} = \\frac{1}{N_p A_c} \\int_{0}^{t_{\\text{on}}} V_{\\text{on}} dt = \\frac{V_{\\text{on}} t_{\\text{on}}}{N_p A_c}$$\nSetting this excursion to the maximum allowed value, $\\Delta B_{\\max}$:\n$$V_{\\text{on}} t_{\\text{on}} = N_p A_c \\Delta B_{\\max}$$\nTo return the core flux to its initial state, the flux density must be decreased by the same amount, $\\Delta B_{\\max}$, during the off-time. This requires a reset volt-second product of equal magnitude. The minimum reset voltage magnitude, $V_{\\text{reset,min}}$, is the voltage required to achieve this reset within the available off-time, $t_{\\text{off}}$:\n$$V_{\\text{reset,min}} t_{\\text{off}} = N_p A_c \\Delta B_{\\max}$$\nSolving for $V_{\\text{reset,min}}$:\n$$V_{\\text{reset,min}} = \\frac{N_p A_c \\Delta B_{\\max}}{t_{\\text{off}}}$$\nWe can express $t_{\\text{off}}$ in terms of the given parameters: $t_{\\text{off}} = (1 - D_{\\text{on}})T = \\frac{1 - D_{\\text{on}}}{f_{\\text{rep}}}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $V_{\\text{reset,min}}$ yields the final symbolic formula:\n$$V_{\\text{reset,min}} = \\frac{N_p A_c \\Delta B_{\\max} f_{\\text{rep}}}{1 - D_{\\text{on}}}$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values provided:\n- $N_{p} = 26$\n- $A_{c} = 1.8 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}$\n- $f_{\\text{rep}} = 250\\ \\mathrm{kHz} = 2.5 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $D_{\\text{on}} = 0.35$\n- $\\Delta B_{\\max} = 0.18\\ \\mathrm{T}$\n\n$$V_{\\text{reset,min}} = \\frac{(26) \\cdot (1.8 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}) \\cdot (0.18\\ \\mathrm{T}) \\cdot (2.5 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1})}{1 - 0.35}$$\n$$V_{\\text{reset,min}} = \\frac{(26) \\cdot (1.8 \\times 10^{-5}) \\cdot (0.18) \\cdot (2.5 \\times 10^5)}{0.65}\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\nFirst, we calculate the numerator:\nNumerator $= 26 \\times 1.8 \\times 0.18 \\times 2.5 \\times 10^{-5} \\times 10^{5} = 26 \\times 1.8 \\times 0.18 \\times 2.5 = 21.06$\nNow, we perform the division:\n$$V_{\\text{reset,min}} = \\frac{21.06}{0.65} \\approx 32.4\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\nThe calculation yields $32.4$.

The requested ratio $R$ is:\n$$R = \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{interleaved}}}{f_{\\mathrm{non\\text{-}interleaved}}} = \\frac{1/(2\\pi\\sqrt{L_{\\ell, \\text{inter}} C_{iw, \\text{inter}}})}{1/(2\\pi\\sqrt{L_{\\ell, \\text{non-int}} C_{iw, \\text{non-int}}})} = \\sqrt{\\frac{L_{\\ell, \\text{non-int}} C_{iw, \\text{non-int}}}{L_{\\ell, \\text{inter}} C_{iw, \\text{inter}}}}$$\nWe now compute the product $L_{\\ell}C_{iw}$ for each configuration using the derived symbolic expressions.\n\nFor the non-interleaved configuration:\n$$L_{\\ell, \\text{non-int}} C_{iw, \\text{non-int}} = \\left(\\mu_0 \\frac{l D}{w}\\right) \\left(\\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r \\frac{w l}{D}\\right) = \\mu_0 \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r l^2$$\n\nFor the interleaved configuration:\n$$L_{\\ell, \\text{inter}} C_{iw, \\text{inter}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_0 \\frac{l \\delta}{w}\\right) \\left(2 \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r \\frac{w l}{\\delta}\\right) = \\mu_0 \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r l^2$$\n\nThe products are analytically identical. This is because the geometric dependencies on the transverse dimensions ($w$, $D$, $\\delta$) cancel out in the $LC$ product for both topologies under the given idealizations. The product simplifies to a term dependent only on the material constants ($\\mu_0, \\varepsilon_0, \\varepsilon_r$) and the overlap length ($l$).\n\nSubstituting these identical results into the expression for the ratio $R$:\n$$R = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu_0 \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r l^2}{\\mu_0 \\varepsilon_0 \\varepsilon_r l^2}} = \\sqrt{1} = 1$$\nThe ratio $R$ is analytically equal to $1$. Expressing this result as a decimal rounded to four significant figures gives $1.000$.",
