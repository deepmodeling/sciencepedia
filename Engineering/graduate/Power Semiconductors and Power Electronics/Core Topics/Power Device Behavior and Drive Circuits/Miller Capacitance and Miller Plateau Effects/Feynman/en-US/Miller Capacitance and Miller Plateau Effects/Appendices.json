The small-signal voltage gain is given by $A_{v}=-g_{m}R_{d}$, where $g_{m}$ is the small-signal transconductance and $R_{d}$ is the drain resistance.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of electronic circuit theory, specifically the small-signal analysis of MOSFET amplifiers. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions and data for a unique solution. The language is objective and the parameters provided ($g_m$, $R_d$, $C_{gs}$, $C_{gd}$) are physically realistic for a power MOSFET.\n\nThe objective is to derive the effective input capacitance, $C_{\\text{in,eff}}$, of a common-source MOSFET amplifier. The total input gate current, $i_g(t)$, is the sum of the displacement currents flowing through the gate-to-source capacitance, $C_{gs}$, and the gate-to-drain capacitance, $C_{gd}$. Let $v_g(t)$, $v_s(t)$, and $v_d(t)$ be the small-signal voltages at the gate, source, and drain terminals, respectively.\n\nThe current through a capacitor $C$ is given by $i(t) = C \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_C(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}$, where $v_C(t)$ is the voltage across the capacitor.\nThe total gate current is:\n$$\ni_g(t) = i_{gs}(t) + i_{gd}(t)\n$$\nwhere $i_{gs}(t)$ is the current through $C_{gs}$ and $i_{gd}(t)$ is the current through $C_{gd}$.\n\nThe voltage across the gate-to-source capacitance is $v_{gs}(t) = v_g(t) - v_s(t)$. Since the source is at small-signal ground, $v_s(t) = 0$, which simplifies the voltage to $v_{gs}(t) = v_g(t)$. The current $i_{gs}(t)$ is therefore:\n$$\ni_{gs}(t) = C_{gs} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{gs}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = C_{gs} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_g(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n$$\n\nThe voltage across the gate-to-drain capacitance is $v_{gd}(t) = v_g(t) - v_d(t)$. The current $i_{gd}(t)$ is:\n$$\ni_{gd}(t) = C_{gd} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{gd}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = C_{gd} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\left( v_g(t) - v_d(t) \\right)\n$$\n\nThe problem states that the small-signal voltage gain of the common-source stage is $A_v$. The relationship between the drain voltage and the gate voltage is thus $v_d(t) = A_v v_g(t)$. Substituting this into the expression for $i_{gd}(t)$:\n$$\ni_{gd}(t) = C_{gd} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\left( v_g(t) - A_v v_g(t) \\right)\n$$\nSince $A_v$ is a constant gain factor under linear operation, we can factor it out of the derivative:\n$$\ni_{gd}(t) = C_{gd} (1 - A_v) \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_g(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n$$\n\nNow, we sum the two current components to find the total gate current $i_g(t)$:\n$$\ni_g(t) = i_{gs}(t) + i_{gd}(t) = C_{gs} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_g(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} + C_{gd} (1 - A_v) \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_g(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n$$\nFactoring out the common term $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_g(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}$:\n$$\ni_g(t) = \\left[ C_{gs} + C_{gd}(1 - A_v) \\right] \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_g(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}\n$$\n\nThe problem defines the effective input capacitance, $C_{\\text{in,eff}}$, as the proportionality constant such that $i_g(t) = C_{\\text{in,eff}} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_g(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}$. By comparing this definition with the derived expression for $i_g(t)$, we identify the symbolic relationship for $C_{\\text{in,eff}}$:\n$$\nC_{\\text{in,eff}} = C_{gs} + C_{gd}(1 - A_v)\n$$\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression using the given numerical values:\n$C_{gs} = 2\\ \\mathrm{nF} = 2 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{F}$\n$C_{gd} = 300\\ \\mathrm{pF} = 0.3 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{F}$\n$g_m = 10\\ \\mathrm{S}$\n$R_d = 5\\ \\Omega$\n\nFirst, we calculate the small-signal voltage gain, $A_v$:\n$$\nA_v = -g_m R_d = -(10\\ \\mathrm{S})(5\\ \\Omega) = -50\n$$\nThe gain $A_v$ is a dimensionless quantity.\n\nNow, we substitute the values of $C_{gs}$, $C_{gd}$, and $A_v$ into the expression for $C_{\\text{in,eff}}$:\n$$\nC_{\\text{in,eff}} = (2 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{F}) + (0.3 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{F})(1 - (-50))\n$$\n$$\nC_{\\text{in,eff}} = (2 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{F}) + (0.3 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{F})(51)\n$$\n$$\nC_{\\text{in,eff}} = (2 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{F}) + (15.3 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{F})\n$$\n$$\nC_{\\text{in,eff}} = 17.3 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{F} = 17.3\\ \\mathrm{nF}\n$$\nThe result rounded to three significant figures is $17.3\\ \\mathrm{nF}$.\n\nDiscussion of the physical meaning:\nThe derived expression $C_{\\text{in,eff}} = C_{gs} + C_{gd}(1 - A_v)$ is a classic result known as the Miller theorem applied to input capacitance. The term $C_{gd}(1 - A_v)$ is the Miller capacitance, $C_M$. For an inverting amplifier like the common-source stage, $A_v$ is a large negative number, making the factor $(1 - A_v)$ large and positive. In this case, $(1 - (-50)) = 51$. This means the physical gate-to-drain capacitance $C_{gd}$ is effectively multiplied by a factor of $51$ when viewed from the input gate terminal. The total effective input capacitance is thus dominated by this amplified Miller capacitance ($15.3\\ \\mathrm{nF}$) rather than the intrinsic gate-to-source capacitance ($2\\ \\mathrm{nF}$) or the physical gate-to-drain capacitance ($0.3\\ \\mathrm{nF}$). This phenomenon is the Miller effect.\n\nIn the context of power switching, this large effective input capacitance is responsible for the **Miller plateau**. When a power MOSFET is being turned on by a gate driver, the gate voltage $v_g(t)$ rises. As the MOSFET begins to conduct, it enters its active region where the gain $|A_v|$ becomes large and the drain voltage $v_d(t)$ begins to fall. During this phase, the gate driver must supply a large amount of charge to the large Miller capacitance. If the gate driver supplies a nearly constant current $i_g$, the rate of change of the gate voltage, $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_g}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{i_g}{C_{\\text{in,eff}}}$, becomes very small because $C_{\\text{in,eff}}$ is at its maximum. Consequently, the gate voltage remains almost constant for a period of time, forming a \"plateau\" in its waveform. This prolongs the switching transition time, during which the MOSFET simultaneously has high voltage across it and high current through it, leading to significant switching power losses. The duration of the Miller plateau is therefore a critical factor limiting the switching frequency and efficiency of power converters. The calculation demonstrates how a physically small capacitance ($C_{gd}$) has a disproportionately large impact on device dynamics.",

            "solution": "The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded, describing a standard turn-on transient for a power MOSFET. All necessary parameters are provided, and the assumptions are physically reasonable for a simplified analysis.\n\n### Step 1: Derivation of the Gate Plateau Voltage ($V_{\\text{plateau}}$)\n\nThe Miller plateau is the phase of the switching transient where the gate-source voltage, $V_{gs}$, remains constant while the drain-source voltage, $V_{ds}$, falls. During this interval, the MOSFET operates in the active (saturation) region, and its channel must conduct the full load current, which is given as a constant $I_d$.\n\nThe problem states that the device transconductance, $g_m$, is approximately constant. The transconductance is defined by the first principle $g_m = \\frac{\\partial I_d}{\\partial V_{gs}}$. For a constant $g_m$, we can use a linear model to relate the drain current $I_d$ to the gate-source voltage $V_{gs}$ above the threshold voltage $V_{\\text{th}}$. This relationship is given by:\n$$I_d = g_m (V_{gs} - V_{\\text{th}})$$\nThe gate plateau voltage, $V_{\\text{plateau}}$, is the specific value of $V_{gs}$ required to sustain the constant drain current $I_d = 20\\ \\mathrm{A}$. Therefore, we can set $V_{gs} = V_{\\text{plateau}}$ in the equation above:\n$$I_d = g_m (V_{\\text{plateau}} - V_{\\text{th}})$$\nTo derive the expression for $V_{\\text{plateau}}$, we rearrange the equation. Starting by dividing by $g_m$:\n$$\\frac{I_d}{g_m} = V_{\\text{plateau}} - V_{\\text{th}}$$\nThen, we isolate $V_{\\text{plateau}}$:\n$$V_{\\text{plateau}} = V_{\\text{th}} + \\frac{I_d}{g_m}$$\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Miller Plateau Duration ($t_M$)\n\nDuring the Miller plateau, the gate-source voltage is constant, $V_{gs}(t) = V_{\\text{plateau}}$. The gate circuit consists of the ideal driver voltage source $V_{\\text{drv}}$ connected to the gate through the series gate resistance $R_g$.\n\nAccording to Ohm's law, the current flowing from the driver into the gate, $i_g$, is determined by the voltage drop across the gate resistor $R_g$:\n$$i_g = \\frac{V_{\\text{drv}} - V_{gs}(t)}{R_g}$$\nSince $V_{gs}(t) = V_{\\text{plateau}}$ is constant during this phase, the gate current $i_g$ is also constant:\n$$i_g = \\frac{V_{\\text{drv}} - V_{\\text{plateau}}}{R_g}$$\nThis gate current charges the parasitic capacitances of the MOSFET. The total gate current $i_g$ splits into two paths: the current charging the gate-source capacitance, $i_{C_{gs}} = C_{gs}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{gs}}{\\mathrm{d}t}$, and the current charging the gate-drain capacitance, $i_{C_{gd}} = C_{gd}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{gd}}{\\mathrm{d}t}$. Since $V_{gs}$ is constant during the Miller plateau, $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V_{gs}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 0$, which implies that the current into the gate-source capacitance is zero, $i_{C_{gs}} = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the entire gate current $i_g$ flows through the gate-drain capacitance $C_{gd}$. This current is responsible for changing the drain-source voltage and is often called the Miller current.\nThe fundamental relationship between charge $Q$, constant current $i$, and time $t$ is $Q = i \\cdot t$. In this context, the charge supplied to the gate-drain terminal during the voltage transition is the given Miller charge, $Q_{gd}$. This charge is supplied by the constant gate current $i_g$ over the duration of the Miller plateau, $t_M$.\n$$Q_{gd} = i_g \\cdot t_M$$\nTo find the duration $t_M$, we rearrange this equation:\n$$t_M = \\frac{Q_{gd}}{i_g}$$\nSubstituting the expression for the constant gate current $i_g$ derived from Ohm's law:\n$$t_M = \\frac{Q_{gd}}{\\left(\\frac{V_{\\text{drv}} - V_{\\text{plateau}}}{R_g}\\right)}$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$t_M = \\frac{Q_{gd} R_g}{V_{\\text{drv}} - V_{\\text{plateau}}}$$\n\n### Step 3: Numerical Computation\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Drain current $I_d = 20\\ \\mathrm{A}$\n- Gate drive voltage $V_{\\text{drv}} = 12\\ \\mathrm{V}$\n- Gate resistance $R_g = 5\\ \\Omega$\n- Miller charge $Q_{gd} = 30\\ \\mathrm{nC} = 30 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{C}$\n- Transconductance $g_m = 8\\ \\mathrm{S}$\n- Threshold voltage $V_{\\text{th}} = 3\\ \\mathrm{V}$\n\nFirst, we compute the numerical value for $V_{\\text{plateau}}$:\n$$V_{\\text{plateau}} = 3\\ \\mathrm{V} + \\frac{20\\ \\mathrm{A}}{8\\ \\mathrm{S}} = 3\\ \\mathrm{V} + 2.5\\ \\mathrm{V} = 5.5\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $V_{\\text{plateau}} = 5.50\\ \\mathrm{V}$.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value for $t_M$ using the calculated $V_{\\text{plateau}}$:\n$$t_M = \\frac{(30 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{C}) \\cdot (5\\ \\Omega)}{12\\ \\mathrm{V} - 5.5\\ \\mathrm{V}} = \\frac{150 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{C} \\cdot \\Omega}{6.5\\ \\mathrm{V}}$$\nSince $\\mathrm{C} \\cdot \\Omega / \\mathrm{V} = (\\mathrm{A} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{V} / \\mathrm{A}) / \\mathrm{V} = \\mathrm{s}$, the unit is correct.\n$$t_M = \\frac{150}{6.5} \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{s} \\approx 23.0769... \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{s}$$\nThe problem asks for the result in nanoseconds ($\\mathrm{ns}$), where $1\\ \\mathrm{ns} = 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{s}$.\n$$t_M \\approx 23.0769...\\ \\mathrm{ns}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $t_M = 23.1\\ \\mathrm{ns}$.\n\nThe final answer is requested in the order $(t_M, V_{\\text{plateau}})$.
