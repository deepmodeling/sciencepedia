Assume the hard-recovery limit in which the reverse current rises linearly from zero to the peak reverse recovery current $I_{RM}$ with slope $d i / d t$, and then drops to zero abruptly.

During the reverse-recovery interval, assume the following physically justified conditions hold:\n\n- A stiff source and low parasitic inductance impose an approximately constant reverse voltage $V_{R}$ across the diode for the entire reverse-recovery interval.\n- The diode’s reverse-recovery current $i_{RR}(t)$ is well approximated by a triangular waveform of peak magnitude $I_{RM}$ and total reverse-recovery duration $t_{rr}$, returning to zero at $t=t_{rr}$.\n- The depletion-layer (junction) capacitance displacement current and any time-variation of $V_{R}$ are negligible during the interval of interest, and the dissipated energy of interest is that associated with removing the stored charge in the diode.\n- The reverse-recovery charge is defined as $Q_{rr} \\equiv \\int_{0}^{t_{rr}} |i_{RR}(t)|\\,dt$.\n\nStarting only from the definitions of electrical work and charge continuity, derive an analytic approximation for the reverse-recovery energy $E_{rec}$ dissipated in the diode over the interval $t\\in[0,t_{rr}]$ under the constant-$V_{R}$ assumption.

            "solution": "The derivation of the reverse-recovery energy, $E_{rec}$, begins with the fundamental definition of electrical energy as the time integral of instantaneous electrical power, $p(t)$. The instantaneous power dissipated in a component is the product of the voltage across it, $v(t)$, and the current flowing through it, $i(t)$.\n$$p(t) = v(t) i(t)$$\nThe energy dissipated, $E$, over a time interval from $t_1$ to $t_2$ is therefore:\n$$E = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} p(t) \\, dt = \\int_{t_1}^{t_2} v(t) i(t) \\, dt$$\nIn the context of this problem, we are calculating the energy dissipated during the reverse-recovery period of the diode, which extends from $t=0$ to $t=t_{rr}$. The energy is denoted as $E_{rec}$.\n\nDuring this interval, the problem specifies the following conditions:\n$1$. The voltage across the diode is a constant reverse voltage, $V_{R}$. So, $v(t) = V_{R}$.\n$2$. The current flowing through the diode is the reverse-recovery current, $i_{RR}(t)$. The power dissipated is a positive quantity, calculated as the product of the magnitude of voltage and current. Thus, the instantaneous power is $p(t) = V_{R} |i_{RR}(t)|$.\n\nSubstituting these into the energy integral gives the expression for the reverse-recovery energy:\n$$E_{rec} = \\int_{0}^{t_{rr}} V_{R} |i_{RR}(t)| \\, dt$$\nSince $V_{R}$ is stipulated to be constant over the integration interval, it can be factored out of the integral:\n$$E_{rec} = V_{R} \\int_{0}^{t_{rr}} |i_{RR}(t)| \\, dt$$\nThe problem provides a definition for the total reverse-recovery charge, $Q_{rr}$, as the integral of the magnitude of the reverse-recovery current over the duration $t_{rr}$:\n$$Q_{rr} \\equiv \\int_{0}^{t_{rr}} |i_{RR}(t)| \\, dt$$\nBy direct substitution of this definition, we obtain the first required expression for the recovery energy in terms of $V_{R}$ and $Q_{rr}$:\n$$E_{rec} = V_{R} Q_{rr}$$\nTo obtain the second, equivalent expression, we must evaluate $Q_{rr}$ using the given physical model for the current waveform. The problem states that the reverse-recovery current, $i_{RR}(t)$, is well approximated by a triangular waveform. This implies that its magnitude, $|i_{RR}(t)|$, forms a triangle on a plot of current versus time. The base of this triangle is the reverse-recovery time, $t_{rr}$, and its height is the peak reverse-recovery current magnitude, $I_{RM}$.\n\nThe integral for $Q_{rr}$ represents the area under the curve of $|i_{RR}(t)|$ from $t=0$ to $t=t_{rr}$.

Both diodes exhibit the same total reverse recovery time $t_{rr}$ and the same peak reverse current $I_{RM}$ when measured under identical commutation conditions.\n\nThe recovery waveform is defined by the standard time intervals $t_a$ (current rise to $I_{RM}$) and $t_b$ (current fall from $I_{RM}$), such that $t_{rr} = t_a + t_b$. The softness factor, $S$, is defined as the ratio $S = t_b/t_a$. A larger $S$ indicates a \"softer,\" less abrupt recovery.
