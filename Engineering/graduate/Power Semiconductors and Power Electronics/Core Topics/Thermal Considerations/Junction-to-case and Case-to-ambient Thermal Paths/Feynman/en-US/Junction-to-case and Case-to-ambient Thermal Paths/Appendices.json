            "problem": "A square silicon die is attached to a copper case by a solder layer. The dominant steady-state heat flow from the junction to the case is through the solder in the thickness direction. The die has area $A$, and the solder layer has uniform thickness $L$ and isotropic thermal conductivity $k_{s}$. A manufacturing defect introduces volumetric voids distributed uniformly across the attach plane, reducing the effective load-bearing and heat-carrying area to a fraction $(1-\\varphi)A$, where $0<\\varphi<1$ is the void area fraction. Additionally, the microscopic roughness and ligamentary current paths around voids introduce an interfacial thermal resistance that can be lumped as a finite thermal contact conductance $h_{c}$ at the die-solder interface. Assume one-dimensional heat flow in the solder layer, negligible in-plane temperature gradients in the die, an isothermal case surface just beneath the solder, and that all void-induced effects are captured by the reduction in effective area and the finite interfacial conductance $h_{c}$.\n\nStarting from Fourier’s law of heat conduction and the definition of thermal resistance, and using only constitutive definitions for interfacial heat transfer, perform the following:\n\n1. Derive an expression for the ideal junction-to-case thermal resistance through the solder layer, $R_{\\text{ideal}}$, when $\\varphi=0$ and interfacial conductance is effectively infinite.\n2. Derive an expression for the actual junction-to-case thermal resistance, $R_{\\text{actual}}$, when the effective area is reduced to $(1-\\varphi)A$ and a finite interfacial conductance $h_{c}$ is present at the die-solder interface.\n3.

Additionally, briefly explain, in words, how the presence of a large case-to-ambient thermal resistance would qualitatively affect the impact of this junction-to-case error on the overall junction-to-ambient thermal path, but note that your final reported answer must be only the numerical value of $\\epsilon$ as specified.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. The provided parameters and assumptions are physically realistic for a standard power electronics packaging scenario. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is approached by first establishing the fundamental definitions of thermal resistance from the principles of heat transfer. These definitions are then applied to derive the thermal resistance for both the ideal and actual cases, followed by the derivation and calculation of the fractional error.\n\nThe fundamental relationship for one-dimensional, steady-state heat conduction is given by Fourier's law, where the heat flow rate $P$ across a cross-sectional area $A_{\\text{eff}}$ is:\n$$ P = -k A_{\\text{eff}} \\frac{dT}{dx} $$\nwhere $k$ is the thermal conductivity and $\\frac{dT}{dx}$ is the temperature gradient. For a layer of uniform thickness $L$ with a temperature difference $\\Delta T$ across it, this integrates to $P = \\frac{k A_{\\text{eff}}}{L} \\Delta T$. The thermal resistance for conduction, $R_{\\text{cond}}$, is defined through the analogy $P = \\frac{\\Delta T}{R_{\\text{cond}}}$, which yields:\n$$ R_{\\text{cond}} = \\frac{L}{k A_{\\text{eff}}} $$\nFor heat transfer across an interface, the heat flow rate is governed by the thermal contact conductance, $h_c$, such that $P = h_c A_{\\text{eff}} \\Delta T_{\\text{int}}$, where $\\Delta T_{\\text{int}}$ is the temperature drop across the interface. The corresponding interfacial thermal resistance, $R_{\\text{int}}$, is:\n$$ R_{\\text{int}} = \\frac{1}{h_c A_{\\text{eff}}} $$\nWhen multiple thermal elements are in series along the heat flow path, their resistances add up to give the total thermal resistance.\n\n1.  Derivation of the ideal junction-to-case thermal resistance, $R_{\\text{ideal}}$.\nIn the ideal case, there are no voids, so the void area fraction $\\varphi=0$. The effective heat transfer area is the full die area, $A_{\\text{eff}} = (1-0)A = A$. The interfacial conductance is assumed to be infinite, $h_c \\to \\infty$. The interfacial thermal resistance is therefore $R_{\\text{int,ideal}} = \\frac{1}{h_c A} \\to 0$. The total thermal resistance is composed solely of the conduction resistance through the solder layer.\n$$ R_{\\text{ideal}} = R_{\\text{cond,ideal}} = \\frac{L}{k_s A} $$\n\n2.  Derivation of the actual junction-to-case thermal resistance, $R_{\\text{actual}}$.\nIn the actual case, the presence of voids reduces the effective area for heat transfer to $A_{\\text{eff}} = (1-\\varphi)A$. Additionally, there is a finite interfacial thermal contact conductance, $h_c$. The total thermal path from the die junction to the case now consists of two thermal resistances in series: the interfacial resistance at the die-solder boundary and the conduction resistance of the bulk solder.\nThe interfacial resistance is:\n$$ R_{\\text{int,actual}} = \\frac{1}{h_c A_{\\text{eff}}} = \\frac{1}{h_c (1-\\varphi) A} $$\nThe conduction resistance through the solder is:\n$$ R_{\\text{cond,actual}} = \\frac{L}{k_s A_{\\text{eff}}} = \\frac{L}{k_s (1-\\varphi) A} $$\nThe total actual thermal resistance is the sum of these two series components:\n$$ R_{\\text{actual}} = R_{\\text{int,actual}} + R_{\\text{cond,actual}} = \\frac{1}{h_c (1-\\varphi) A} + \\frac{L}{k_s (1-\\varphi) A} $$\n\n3.  Derivation of the fractional error, $\\epsilon$.\nThe fractional error $\\epsilon$ is defined as $\\epsilon \\equiv \\frac{R_{\\text{actual}}-R_{\\text{ideal}}}{R_{\\text{ideal}}}$. Substituting the expressions derived above:\n$$ \\epsilon = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{1}{h_c (1-\\varphi) A} + \\frac{L}{k_s (1-\\varphi) A}\\right) - \\frac{L}{k_s A}}{\\frac{L}{k_s A}} $$\nWe can simplify this expression by dividing the numerator and denominator by $\\frac{1}{A}$:\n$$ \\epsilon = \\frac{\\frac{1}{h_c (1-\\varphi)} + \\frac{L}{k_s (1-\\varphi)} - \\frac{L}{k_s}}{\\frac{L}{k_s}} $$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $\\frac{k_s}{L}$:\n$$ \\epsilon = \\frac{k_s}{L} \\left( \\frac{1}{h_c (1-\\varphi)} + \\frac{L}{k_s (1-\\varphi)} - \\frac{L}{k_s} \\right) $$\nDistributing the $\\frac{k_s}{L}$ term:\n$$ \\epsilon = \\frac{k_s}{h_c L (1-\\varphi)} + \\frac{1}{1-\\varphi} - 1 $$\nCombining the last two terms:\n$$ \\frac{1}{1-\\varphi} - 1 = \\frac{1 - (1-\\varphi)}{1-\\varphi} = \\frac{\\varphi}{1-\\varphi} $$\nThis yields the final closed-form analytic expression for the fractional error:\n$$ \\epsilon = \\frac{\\varphi}{1-\\varphi} + \\frac{k_s}{(1-\\varphi)h_c L} $$\nThis expression clearly separates the error contribution from the geometric area reduction ($\\frac{\\varphi}{1-\\varphi}$) and the contribution from the finite interfacial conductance, which is also amplified by the area reduction.\n\nNow, we evaluate $\\epsilon$ numerically using the provided parameter values. First, we convert all parameters to base SI units.\n- $A = 25 \\, \\mathrm{mm}^2 = 25 \\times (10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{m})^2 = 2.5 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\mathrm{m}^2$ (Note: $A$ cancels out in the final expression for $\\epsilon$).\n- $L = 80 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{m} = 80 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\mathrm{m} = 8.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\mathrm{m}$.\n- $k_s = 50 \\, \\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.\n- $\\varphi = 0.20$, which makes $1-\\varphi = 0.80$.\n- $h_c = 1.0 \\times 10^7 \\, \\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.\n\nWe calculate the two terms of the expression for $\\epsilon$:\nThe first term, due to area reduction:\n$$ \\frac{\\varphi}{1-\\varphi} = \\frac{0.20}{0.80} = 0.25 $$\nThe second term, due to interfacial resistance and its coupling with area reduction:\n$$ \\frac{k_s}{(1-\\varphi)h_c L} = \\frac{50 \\, \\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}}{(0.80)(1.0 \\times 10^7 \\, \\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1})(8.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\mathrm{m})} $$\n$$ \\frac{k_s}{(1-\\varphi)h_c L} = \\frac{50}{(0.80)(1.0 \\times 10^7)(8.0 \\times 10^{-5})} = \\frac{50}{6.4 \\times 10^2} = \\frac{50}{640} = \\frac{5}{64} $$\n$$ \\frac{5}{64} = 0.078125 $$\nThe total fractional error is the sum of these two components:\n$$ \\epsilon = 0.25 + 0.078125 = 0.328125 $$\nRounding the result to three significant figures as required:\n$$ \\epsilon \\approx 0.328 $$\n\nFinally, regarding the qualitative effect of case-to-ambient thermal resistance ($R_{\\text{c-a}}$): The total junction-to-ambient thermal resistance is $R_{\\text{j-a}} = R_{\\text{j-c}} + R_{\\text{c-a}}$. The fractional error in $R_{\\text{j-c}}$ has a diminished effect on the fractional error of the *total* thermal path if $R_{\\text{c-a}}$ is large. Specifically, the fractional error in the total path is $\\epsilon_{\\text{total}} = \\epsilon \\left( \\frac{R_{\\text{j-c, ideal}}}{R_{\\text{j-c, ideal}} + R_{\\text{c-a}}} \\right)$. As $R_{\\text{c-a}}$ becomes much larger than $R_{\\text{j-c}}$, the ratio term becomes small, reducing the overall fractional error. This means the system's thermal performance becomes dominated by the case-to-ambient path (e.g., the heat sink), making it less sensitive to variations or defects in the internal junction-to-case path.",

The datasheet $R_{\\mathrm{thJC}}$ is obtained with a Dirichlet isothermal boundary at the case enforced by a high-conductivity cold plate, so it isolates only internal conduction from the junction to the defined case reference and excludes any external interface or sink effects. In the real system, the case boundary is not perfectly isothermal and additional series path resistances arise from the TIM and the heat sink’s case-to-ambient path.

The datasheet $R_{\\mathrm{thJC}}$ presumes a typical grease layer and finite heat sink, so the TIM and heat sink resistances should be counted as part of $R_{\\mathrm{thJC}}$.

It describes a standard engineering scenario without bias.\n\nNo flaws are found in the problem statement. It is scientifically sound, complete, and unambiguous.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe problem requires the calculation of the semiconductor junction temperature ($T_{\\mathrm{j}}$) under two different thermal boundary conditions:\n1.  The idealized datasheet test condition.\n2.  The practical in-system application condition.\n\nThe fundamental principle is the thermal resistance model, which is an analogy to Ohm's law, stated as $\\Delta T = P \\times R_{\\mathrm{th}}$, where $\\Delta T$ is the temperature difference across a thermal path, $P$ is the heat power flowing through it, and $R_{\\mathrm{th}}$ is the thermal resistance of the path.\n\n**Scenario 1: Datasheet Test Fixture**\nThe problem states that the datasheet measurement for $R_{\\mathrm{thJC}}$ is performed with a fixture that holds the case at a uniform temperature, $T_{\\mathrm{case}} = 40^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$. This is an idealized boundary condition (a Dirichlet boundary condition) where the case is treated as a perfect heat sink at a fixed temperature. The thermal path is solely from the junction to the case.\nThe junction temperature is calculated as:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{j}} = T_{\\mathrm{case}} + P \\cdot R_{\\mathrm{thJC}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{j}} = 40^\\circ\\mathrm{C} + (200\\,\\mathrm{W}) \\times (0.08\\,\\mathrm{K/W})$$\n$$T_{\\mathrm{j}} = 40^\\circ\\mathrm{C} + 16\\,\\mathrm{K} = 56^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$$\nThe use of $\\mathrm{K}$ for the temperature rise is equivalent to using $^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ for the temperature difference.\n\n**Scenario 2: Real System Application**\nIn the real system, the heat path extends from the junction to the ambient air. This forms a series thermal circuit. The total junction-to-ambient thermal resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{thJA}}$, is the sum of the individual resistances in the path:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{thJA}} = R_{\\mathrm{thJC}} + R_{\\mathrm{thCS}} + R_{\\mathrm{thSA}}$$\nwhere:\n-   $R_{\\mathrm{thJC}}$ is the junction-to-case resistance ($0.08\\,\\mathrm{K/W}$).\n-   $R_{\\mathrm{thCS}}$ is the case-to-sink resistance, which is the resistance of the Thermal Interface Material (TIM).\n-   $R_{\\mathrm{thSA}}$ is the sink-to-ambient resistance ($0.25\\,\\mathrm{K/W}$).\n\nFirst, we must calculate the thermal resistance of the TIM, $R_{\\mathrm{thCS}}$, using the formula for one-dimensional conduction through a planar layer:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{thCS}} = \\frac{t}{k \\cdot A}$$\nThe given parameters must be in consistent SI units.\n-   $t = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 100 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 1 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n-   $k = 5\\,\\mathrm{W/(m\\cdot K)}$\n-   $A = 25\\,\\mathrm{cm^2} = 25 \\times (10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2 = 25 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2 = 0.0025\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$\n\nSubstituting these values:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{thCS}} = \\frac{1 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}}{5\\,\\mathrm{W/(m\\cdot K)} \\times 25 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2} = \\frac{1 \\times 10^{-4}}{125 \\times 10^{-4}}\\,\\mathrm{K/W} = \\frac{1}{125}\\,\\mathrm{K/W} = 0.008\\,\\mathrm{K/W}$$\nNow, we can calculate the total thermal resistance from junction to ambient:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{thJA}} = 0.08\\,\\mathrm{K/W} + 0.008\\,\\mathrm{K/W} + 0.25\\,\\mathrm{K/W} = 0.338\\,\\mathrm{K/W}$$\nThe junction temperature in the real system is calculated relative to the ambient temperature, $T_{\\mathrm{amb}}$:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{j}} = T_{\\mathrm{amb}} + P \\cdot R_{\\mathrm{thJA}}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{j}} = 40^\\circ\\mathrm{C} + (200\\,\\mathrm{W}) \\times (0.338\\,\\mathrm{K/W})$$\n$$T_{\\mathrm{j}} = 40^\\circ\\mathrm{C} + 67.6\\,\\mathrm{K} = 107.6^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$$\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A.** This option correctly states that the datasheet $R_{\\mathrm{thJC}}$ is obtained with a Dirichlet isothermal boundary, which isolates internal conduction resistance. It also correctly states that the real system introduces additional series resistances from the TIM and heat sink. The calculation for the datasheet fixture yields $T_{\\mathrm{j}} = 40^\\circ\\mathrm{C}+200\\,\\mathrm{W}\\times 0.08\\,\\mathrm{K/W}=56^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$, which matches our derivation. The calculation for the real system uses the correct formula $T_{\\mathrm{j}}=T_{\\mathrm{amb}}+P\\left(R_{\\mathrm{thJC}}+\\dfrac{t}{kA}+R_{\\mathrm{thSA}}\\right)$ and substitutes the correct values, yielding $T_{\\mathrm{j}} = 40^\\circ\\mathrm{C}+200\\,\\mathrm{W}\\times(0.08+0.008+0.25)\\,\\mathrm{K/W} = 107.6^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$. This also matches our derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B.** This option claims that $R_{\\mathrm{thJC}}$ is measured in still air with a convective boundary and includes case-to-ambient effects. This is factually incorrect and contradicts the problem description of a \"liquid-cooled cold plate fixture\" meant to create an \"isothermal case boundary\". The purpose of the $R_{\\mathrm{thJC}}$ measurement is specifically to *exclude* case-to-ambient effects. The subsequent calculations are based on this false premise.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C.** This option incorrectly claims that $R_{\\mathrm{thJC}}$ presumes a typical grease layer and finite heat sink. Standardized $R_{\\mathrm{thJC}}$ values are defined to be independent of such external system-level components. Furthermore, it incorrectly uses an area of $A=25\\,\\mathrm{mm^2}$ instead of the given $A=25\\,\\mathrm{cm^2}$. This is an error of a factor of $100$ ($1\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2 = 100\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2$). Using this erroneous area, it calculates a TIM resistance of $0.8\\,\\mathrm{K/W}$ and a junction temperature of approximately $266^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$. The premise is wrong and the data used is wrong.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D.** This option incorrectly claims that $R_{\\mathrm{thJC}}$ is measured with a non-isothermal case in natural convection, which contradicts the problem statement. It also claims the TIM resistance is negligible. While the TIM resistance ($0.008\\,\\mathrm{K/W}$) is the smallest component in the thermal stack, it is not zero. Neglecting it leads to a less accurate result ($T_{\\mathrm{j}}=106^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$) than the one obtained by including it ($T_{\\mathrm{j}}=107.6^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$). The primary fault, however, is the incorrect description of the datasheet measurement condition.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

The physical model, involving thermal resistances in series and a linear temperature-dependent electrical resistance, is a standard and widely used approximation in power electronics for thermal analysis. The provided numerical values for electrical and thermal parameters are realistic for a power MOSFET. The problem is well-posed, as it requests a specific, computable quantity (the tightest upper bound on $T_{\\mathrm{j}}$) derived from a complete set of data and constraints. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be constructed.\n\nThe junction temperature, $T_{\\mathrm{j}}$, can be constrained by two independent physical models derived from the provided data. The tightest upper bound on $T_{\\mathrm{j}}$ is the most restrictive (lowest) of the upper bounds produced by these two models.\n\n**Method 1: Electrical Measurement Inference**\n\nThis method uses the measured electrical parameters and the known temperature dependence of the on-state resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{DS(on)}}$.\n\nFrom Ohm's law, the measured resistance of the device under test is given by:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{meas}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{DS(on)}}}{I_{\\mathrm{D}}}\n$$\nwhere $I_{\\mathrm{D}}$ is the true drain current. The ammeter has an accuracy of $\\pm 1.0\\%$, so the true current $I_{\\mathrm{D}}$ lies in the interval:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{D}} \\in [I_{\\mathrm{ind}} \\times (1 - 0.01), I_{\\mathrm{ind}} \\times (1 + 0.01)] = [50.0 \\times 0.99\\,\\mathrm{A}, 50.0 \\times 1.01\\,\\mathrm{A}] = [49.5\\,\\mathrm{A}, 50.5\\,\\mathrm{A}]\n$$\nThis measured resistance corresponds to the device's on-state resistance at the unknown junction temperature $T_{\\mathrm{j}}$, i.e., $R_{\\mathrm{meas}} = R_{\\mathrm{DS(on)}}(T_{\\mathrm{j}})$. Using the provided linear model:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{meas}} = R_{\\mathrm{25}}(1 + \\beta(T_{\\mathrm{j}} - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}))\n$$\nSolving this equation for $T_{\\mathrm{j}}$ yields:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{j}} = T_{\\mathrm{ref}} + \\frac{1}{\\beta}\\left(\\frac{R_{\\mathrm{meas}}}{R_{\\mathrm{25}}} - 1\\right) = T_{\\mathrm{ref}} + \\frac{1}{\\beta}\\left(\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{DS(on)}}}{I_{\\mathrm{D}} R_{\\mathrm{25}}} - 1\\right)\n$$\nTo find the upper bound for $T_{\\mathrm{j}}$ from this electrical model, denoted $T_{\\mathrm{j,elec,max}}$, we must determine the choice of parameter values within their specified ranges that maximizes $T_{\\mathrm{j}}$. Based on the expression, a higher $T_{\\mathrm{j}}$ is obtained by:\n1.  Maximizing the term $\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{DS(on)}}}{I_{\\mathrm{D}} R_{\\mathrm{25}}}$. This requires the minimum value of the denominator, $I_{\\mathrm{D}} R_{\\mathrm{25}}$. This corresponds to $I_{\\mathrm{D,min}}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{25,min}}$.\n2.  Minimizing the temperature coefficient $\\beta$, which appears in the denominator of the main fractional term. This corresponds to $\\beta_{\\mathrm{min}}$.\n\nThus, the upper bound is given by:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{j,elec,max}} = T_{\\mathrm{ref}} + \\frac{1}{\\beta_{\\mathrm{min}}}\\left(\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{DS(on)}}}{I_{\\mathrm{D,min}} R_{\\mathrm{25,min}}} - 1\\right)\n$$\n\n**Method 2: Thermal Path Analysis**\n\nThis method uses the thermal pathway from the semiconductor junction to the ambient environment. The steady-state temperature rise of the junction above ambient is given by the product of the power dissipated, $P_{\\mathrm{D}}$, and the total junction-to-ambient thermal resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{th,JA}}$.\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{j}} - T_{\\mathrm{a}} = P_{\\mathrm{D}} R_{\\mathrm{th,JA}}\n$$\nThe total thermal resistance is the sum of the series components: $R_{\\mathrm{th,JA}} = R_{\\mathrm{th,JC}} + R_{\\mathrm{th,CA}}$. The power dissipated due to conduction loss (Joule heating) is $P_{\\mathrm{D}} = V_{\\mathrm{DS(on)}} I_{\\mathrm{D}}$. Substituting these into the thermal equation gives:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{j}} = T_{\\mathrm{a}} + (V_{\\mathrm{DS(on)}} I_{\\mathrm{D}})(R_{\\mathrm{th,JC}} + R_{\\mathrm{th,CA}})\n$$\nTo find the upper bound for $T_{\\mathrm{j}}$ from this thermal model, denoted $T_{\\mathrm{j,therm,max}}$, we must maximize the term $(V_{\\mathrm{DS(on)}} I_{\\mathrm{D}})(R_{\\mathrm{th,JC}} + R_{\\mathrm{th,CA}})$. A higher $T_{\\mathrm{j}}$ is obtained by:\n1.  Maximizing the power dissipation $P_{\\mathrm{D}} = V_{\\mathrm{DS(on)}} I_{\\mathrm{D}}$. Since $V_{\\mathrm{DS(on)}}$ is fixed, this requires the maximum current, $I_{\\mathrm{D,max}}$.\n2.  Maximizing the total thermal resistance $R_{\\mathrm{th,JA}}$. This requires the maximum values for its components, $R_{\\mathrm{th,JC,max}}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{th,CA,max}}$.\n\nThus, the upper bound is given by:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{j,therm,max}} = T_{\\mathrm{a}} + (V_{\\mathrm{DS(on)}} I_{\\mathrm{D,max}})(R_{\\mathrm{th,JC,max}} + R_{\\mathrm{th,CA,max}})\n$$\n\n**Combining Bounds and Numerical Calculation**\n\nThe true junction temperature must be consistent with both physical models. Therefore, the actual $T_{\\mathrm{j}}$ must be less than or equal to both $T_{\\mathrm{j,elec,max}}$ and $T_{\\mathrm{j,therm,max}}$. The tightest upper bound on $T_{\\mathrm{j}}$ is the minimum of these two values.\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{j,upper}} = \\min(T_{\\mathrm{j,elec,max}}, T_{\\mathrm{j,therm,max}})\n$$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values into the derived expressions. Note that a temperature difference in Kelvin ($\\mathrm{K}$) is equivalent to a temperature difference in degrees Celsius ($^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$), so we can work directly with Celsius for temperatures.\n\n**Givens for calculation:**\n-   $T_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 25^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$\n-   $T_{\\mathrm{a}} = 27^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$\n-   $V_{\\mathrm{DS(on)}} = 0.300\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n-   $I_{\\mathrm{D,min}} = 49.5\\,\\mathrm{A}$\n-   $I_{\\mathrm{D,max}} = 50.5\\,\\mathrm{A}$\n-   $R_{\\mathrm{25,min}} = 4.6\\,\\mathrm{m}\\Omega = 0.0046\\,\\Omega$\n-   $\\beta_{\\mathrm{min}} = 0.0036\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n-   $R_{\\mathrm{th,JC,max}} = 1.1\\,\\mathrm{K/W}$\n-   $R_{\\mathrm{th,CA,max}} = 3.6\\,\\mathrm{K/W}$\n\n**Calculating $T_{\\mathrm{j,elec,max}}$:**\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{j,elec,max}} = 25^\\circ\\mathrm{C} + \\frac{1}{0.0036\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}}\\left(\\frac{0.300\\,\\mathrm{V}}{(49.5\\,\\mathrm{A})(0.0046\\,\\Omega)} - 1\\right)\n$$\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{j,elec,max}} = 25^\\circ\\mathrm{C} + \\frac{1}{0.0036\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}}\\left(\\frac{0.300}{0.2277} - 1\\right)\n$$\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{j,elec,max}} = 25^\\circ\\mathrm{C} + \\frac{1}{0.0036\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}}(1.317523... - 1)\n$$\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{j,elec,max}} = 25^\\circ\\mathrm{C} + \\frac{0.317523...}{0.0036\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}} = 25^\\circ\\mathrm{C} + 88.2008...^\\circ\\mathrm{C} = 113.2008...^\\circ\\mathrm{C}\n$$\n\n**Calculating $T_{\\mathrm{j,therm,max}}$:**\nFirst, we find the maximum power dissipation:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{D,max}} = V_{\\mathrm{DS(on)}} I_{\\mathrm{D,max}} = (0.300\\,\\mathrm{V})(50.5\\,\\mathrm{A}) = 15.15\\,\\mathrm{W}\n$$\nNext, we find the maximum total thermal resistance:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{th,JA,max}} = R_{\\mathrm{th,JC,max}} + R_{\\mathrm{th,CA,max}} = 1.1\\,\\mathrm{K/W} + 3.6\\,\\mathrm{K/W} = 4.7\\,\\mathrm{K/W}\n$$\nNow, we calculate the temperature:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{j,therm,max}} = T_{\\mathrm{a}} + P_{\\mathrm{D,max}} R_{\\mathrm{th,JA,max}}\n$$\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{j,therm,max}} = 27^\\circ\\mathrm{C} + (15.15\\,\\mathrm{W})(4.7\\,\\mathrm{K/W})\n$$\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{j,therm,max}} = 27^\\circ\\mathrm{C} + 71.205^\\circ\\mathrm{C} = 98.205^\\circ\\mathrm{C}\n$$\n\n**Finding the tightest upper bound:**\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{j,upper}} = \\min(113.2008...^\\circ\\mathrm{C}, 98.205^\\circ\\mathrm{C}) = 98.205^\\circ\\mathrm{C}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the final result is $98.21^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$.",
