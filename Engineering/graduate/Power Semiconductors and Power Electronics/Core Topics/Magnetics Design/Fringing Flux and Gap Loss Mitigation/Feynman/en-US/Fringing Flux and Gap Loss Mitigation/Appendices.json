            "problem": "A gapped ferrite inductor used in a power electronics application is wound on the center leg of a laminated core. The center-leg cross-section is rectangular with width $w$ and stack thickness $t$, and the air gap is uniform with length $g$. The coil has $N$ turns. The ferrite has relative permeability $\\mu_{r,\\text{core}} \\gg 1$, and the inductor operates in the linear, unsaturated regime. The gap is machined square (no chamfer), and the field near the gap edges frings into the surrounding air.\n\nStarting from Ampère’s circuital law $\\oint \\mathbf{H} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = N I$ and the magnetic energy density $u = \\tfrac{1}{2} \\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\mathbf{H}$, use a magnetic-circuit argument to derive the inductance in the gap-dominated limit both when fringing is neglected and when fringing is accounted for by a minimal-energy geometric approximation of the flux aperture.

            "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. All parameters are physically realistic for a power ferrite inductor. The requested derivations are based on fundamental principles of magnetostatics, and the fringing flux model is a standard engineering approximation. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first deriving the inductance of a gapped inductor from fundamental principles using a magnetic circuit model, in the gap-dominated limit. This derivation will be performed for two cases: one neglecting flux fringing and one accounting for it using a geometric approximation. The percentage difference between the two results will then be calculated.\n\nA magnetic circuit is analogous to an electric circuit, where magnetomotive force (MMF), $\\mathcal{F}$, is equivalent to voltage; magnetic flux, $\\Phi$, is equivalent to current; and reluctance, $\\mathcal{R}$, is equivalent to resistance. The MMF produced by a coil of $N$ turns carrying a current $I$ is $\\mathcal{F} = NI$.\n\nAmpère’s circuital law, $\\oint \\mathbf{H} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = N I$, is the basis for the magnetic circuit analysis. The integral is taken around a closed loop following the mean magnetic path. The path consists of the ferrite core, with mean path length $l_c$ and cross-sectional area $A_c = wt$, and the air gap, with length $g$ and area $A_g$. Assuming the fields $H_c$ in the core and $H_g$ in the gap are uniform along their respective paths, Ampère's law simplifies to:\n$$H_c l_c + H_g g = NI$$\nThis is the MMF balance equation. The terms $H_c l_c$ and $H_g g$ represent the MMF drops across the core and the gap, respectively.\n\nThe magnetic flux $\\Phi$ is assumed to be continuous through the circuit. The relationship between magnetic flux density $\\mathbf{B}$ and magnetic field intensity $\\mathbf{H}$ is given by $\\mathbf{B} = \\mu \\mathbf{H}$, where $\\mu$ is the magnetic permeability of the medium. For the core, $\\mu_c = \\mu_0 \\mu_{r,\\text{core}}$, and for the air gap, $\\mu_g = \\mu_0$. The flux is $\\Phi = B_c A_c = B_g A_g$. From this, we can express the field intensities as $H_c = \\frac{\\Phi}{\\mu_c A_c}$ and $H_g = \\frac{\\Phi}{\\mu_g A_g}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the MMF equation gives:\n$$\\frac{\\Phi l_c}{\\mu_c A_c} + \\frac{\\Phi g}{\\mu_g A_g} = NI$$\nFactoring out the flux, we have $\\Phi \\left( \\frac{l_c}{\\mu_c A_c} + \\frac{g}{\\mu_g A_g} \\right) = NI$. The terms in the parenthesis are the reluctances of the core, $\\mathcal{R}_c$, and the gap, $\\mathcal{R}_g$:\n$$\\mathcal{R}_c = \\frac{l_c}{\\mu_0 \\mu_{r,\\text{core}} A_c} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\mathcal{R}_g = \\frac{g}{\\mu_0 A_g}$$\nThe total reluctance is $\\mathcal{R}_{\\text{total}} = \\mathcal{R}_c + \\mathcal{R}_g$. The inductor is in the gap-dominated limit, as the ferrite has high relative permeability, $\\mu_{r,\\text{core}} \\gg 1$. This makes the core reluctance negligible compared to the gap reluctance: $\\mathcal{R}_c \\ll \\mathcal{R}_g$. Thus, $\\mathcal{R}_{\\text{total}} \\approx \\mathcal{R}_g$. The MMF equation becomes $NI \\approx \\Phi \\mathcal{R}_g$.\n\nInductance $L$ is defined as the flux linkage per unit current, $L = \\frac{N\\Phi}{I}$. Substituting $\\Phi \\approx \\frac{NI}{\\mathcal{R}_g}$:\n$$L \\approx \\frac{N^2}{\\mathcal{R}_g} = \\frac{\\mu_0 N^2 A_g}{g}$$\nThis general formula for a gap-dominated inductor can also be derived from the magnetic energy density $u = \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbf{B} \\cdot \\mathbf{H}$. The total energy stored, $W_m = \\frac{1}{2} L I^2$, is dominated by the energy in the gap, $W_g = \\int_{\\text{gap}} u \\,dV \\approx \\frac{1}{2} B_g H_g (A_g g)$. Using $H_g g \\approx NI$ and $B_g = \\mu_0 H_g$, we find $W_m \\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_0 \\left(\\frac{NI}{g}\\right)^2 A_g g = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\mu_0 N^2 A_g I^2}{g}$. Equating this to $\\frac{1}{2} L I^2$ again yields $L = \\frac{\\mu_0 N^2 A_g}{g}$.\n\nWe now apply this result to the two specified cases.\n\n**Case 1: Inductance without fringing ($L_{\\text{without}}$)**\n\nIf fringing flux is neglected, the flux is assumed to be perfectly confined within the physical cross-section of the core as it crosses the gap. The effective gap area is therefore equal to the core's cross-sectional area:\n$$A_g = A = wt$$\nSubstituting this into the inductance formula gives:\n$$L_{\\text{without}} = \\frac{\\mu_0 N^2 wt}{g}$$\n\n**Case 2: Inductance with fringing ($L_{\\text{with}}$)**\n\nFringing flux occurs because the magnetic field lines bulge outward into the surrounding air at the gap, as this path offers a lower total reluctance. A lower reluctance for a given MMF implies a higher flux, and thus a higher inductance. The configuration of the field minimizes the stored magnetic energy, $W_m = \\frac{1}{2} \\Phi^2 \\mathcal{R}$. For a given total flux $\\Phi$, minimizing energy is equivalent to minimizing reluctance. By spreading out, the flux uses a larger effective cross-sectional area $A_{\\text{eff}} > wt$, which reduces the gap reluctance $\\mathcal{R}_g = \\frac{g}{\\mu_0 A_{\\text{eff}}}$.\n\nThe problem specifies a geometric approximation where the effective dimensions of the aperture are increased by an amount comparable to the gap length $g$. A standard engineering model for a rectangular cross-section is to add the gap length $g$ to each linear dimension of the cross-section. This accounts for the flux spreading around the four sides of the gap.\nThe effective width becomes $w_{\\text{eff}} = w+g$.\nThe effective thickness becomes $t_{\\text{eff}} = t+g$.\nThe effective gap area is then:\n$$A_{\\text{eff}} = (w+g)(t+g)$$\nSubstituting this effective area into the inductance formula gives the inductance with fringing:\n$$L_{\\text{with}} = \\frac{\\mu_0 N^2 A_{\\text{eff}}}{g} = \\frac{\\mu_0 N^2 (w+g)(t+g)}{g}$$\n\n**Calculation of the Percentage Difference $\\delta$**\n\nThe percentage difference $\\delta$ is defined as:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{L_{\\text{with}} - L_{\\text{without}}}{L_{\\text{without}}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $L_{\\text{with}}$ and $L_{\\text{without}}$:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{\\frac{\\mu_0 N^2 (w+g)(t+g)}{g} - \\frac{\\mu_0 N^2 wt}{g}}{\\frac{\\mu_0 N^2 wt}{g}}$$\nThe common factor $\\frac{\\mu_0 N^2}{g}$ cancels from the numerator and denominator, demonstrating that the relative change in inductance due to fringing is independent of the number of turns and depends only on the geometry of the core and gap.\n$$\\delta = \\frac{(w+g)(t+g) - wt}{wt}$$\nExpanding the product in the numerator:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{(wt + wg + tg + g^2) - wt}{wt} = \\frac{wg + tg + g^2}{wt}$$\nThis can be simplified by dividing each term in the numerator by the denominator:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{g}{t} + \\frac{g}{w} + \\frac{g^2}{wt}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $w = 20$ mm, $t = 15$ mm, and $g = 1$ mm. Since $\\delta$ is a ratio of lengths, the units are consistent and will cancel.\n$$w = 20$$\n$$t = 15$$\n$$g = 1$$\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $\\delta$:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{1}{15} + \\frac{1}{20} + \\frac{1^2}{(20)(15)}$$\n$$\\delta = \\frac{1}{15} + \\frac{1}{20} + \\frac{1}{300}$$\nTo sum the fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $300$.\n$$\\delta = \\frac{20}{300} + \\frac{15}{300} + \\frac{1}{300} = \\frac{20 + 15 + 1}{300} = \\frac{36}{300}$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{12}{100} = 0.12$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Therefore, we express the result as $0.1200$.\nThis result indicates that fringing increases the inductance by $12\\%$ compared to the non-fringing case for this specific inductor geometry.",

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of magnetic circuits, is well-posed, and uses objective, formal language. We will now proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe solution begins by establishing the fundamental relationship between the inductance factor $A_L$ and the total magnetic reluctance $\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ of the magnetic circuit. The problem provides the definitions for inductance $L$ and magnetic flux $\\Phi$:\n$$ L = \\frac{N\\Phi}{I} $$\n$$ \\Phi = \\frac{NI}{\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{tot}}} $$\nHere, $N$ is the number of turns, $I$ is the current, and $\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ is the total reluctance of the magnetic circuit.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Phi$ into the equation for $L$ yields:\n$$ L = \\frac{N}{I} \\left( \\frac{NI}{\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{tot}}} \\right) = \\frac{N^2}{\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{tot}}} $$\nThe inductance factor $A_L$ is defined as $A_L = L/N^2$.

We can now analyze the three scenarios described in the problem using this relationship.\n\n1.  **Ungapped Core**: For the ungapped core, the total reluctance consists only of the reluctance of the ferrite core, $\\mathcal{R}_c$. Therefore, $\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\mathcal{R}_c$. The ungapped inductance factor, $A_{L,\\mathrm{ungapped}}$, is given by:\n    $$ A_{L,\\mathrm{ungapped}} = \\frac{1}{\\mathcal{R}_c} $$\n    This allows us to express the core reluctance in terms of the given ungapped inductance factor:\n    $$ \\mathcal{R}_c = \\frac{1}{A_{L,\\mathrm{ungapped}}} $$\n\n2.  **Gapped Core, No Fringing**: When an air gap is introduced, its reluctance, $\\mathcal{R}_g$, adds in series with the core reluctance. In the idealized case that neglects fringing fields, the total reluctance is $\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\mathcal{R}_c + \\mathcal{R}_g$. The no-fringing inductance factor, $A_{L,\\mathrm{nf}}$, is thus:\n    $$ A_{L,\\mathrm{nf}} = \\frac{1}{\\mathcal{R}_c + \\mathcal{R}_g} $$\n    From this, we can determine the idealized gap reluctance $\\mathcal{R}_g$. Rearranging the equation gives $\\mathcal{R}_c + \\mathcal{R}_g = 1/A_{L,\\mathrm{nf}}$. Isolating $\\mathcal{R}_g$ and substituting the expression for $\\mathcal{R}_c$ from the ungapped case, we have:\n    $$ \\mathcal{R}_g = \\frac{1}{A_{L,\\mathrm{nf}}} - \\mathcal{R}_c = \\frac{1}{A_{L,\\mathrm{nf}}} - \\frac{1}{A_{L,\\mathrm{ungapped}}} $$\n\n3.  **Gapped Core, With Fringing (Measured)**: In reality, the magnetic flux \"fringes\" or bulges outward in the air gap, which increases the effective cross-sectional area of the gap. The problem defines a fringing factor $\\kappa$ such that the effective gap area is $\\kappa$ times the physical area. Since reluctance is inversely proportional to area, the effective gap reluctance is reduced by this factor: $\\mathcal{R}_{g,\\mathrm{eff}} = \\mathcal{R}_g/\\kappa$. The total reluctance for this real-world measured case is $\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm{tot,meas}} = \\mathcal{R}_c + \\mathcal{R}_g/\\kappa$. The measured inductance factor, $A_{L,\\mathrm{meas}}$, is therefore:\n    $$ A_{L,\\mathrm{meas}} = \\frac{1}{\\mathcal{R}_c + \\mathcal{R}_g/\\kappa} $$\n\nOur goal is to derive an expression for $\\kappa$ and calculate its value. From the measured case, we invert the equation to get the total reluctance:\n$$ \\frac{1}{A_{L,\\mathrm{meas}}} = \\mathcal{R}_c + \\frac{\\mathcal{R}_g}{\\kappa} $$\nIsolating the term containing $\\kappa$:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathcal{R}_g}{\\kappa} = \\frac{1}{A_{L,\\mathrm{meas}}} - \\mathcal{R}_c $$\nNow, we substitute our previously derived expressions for $\\mathcal{R}_c$ and $\\mathcal{R}_g$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\kappa} \\left( \\frac{1}{A_{L,\\mathrm{nf}}} - \\frac{1}{A_{L,\\mathrm{ungapped}}} \\right) = \\frac{1}{A_{L,\\mathrm{meas}}} - \\frac{1}{A_{L,\\mathrm{ungapped}}} $$\nSolving for the fringing factor $\\kappa$:\n$$ \\kappa = \\frac{\\frac{1}{A_{L,\\mathrm{nf}}} - \\frac{1}{A_{L,\\mathrm{ungapped}}}}{\\frac{1}{A_{L,\\mathrm{meas}}} - \\frac{1}{A_{L,\\mathrm{ungapped}}}} $$\nThis is the derived expression for $\\kappa$ in terms of the given inductance factors.

This demonstrates that the fractional increase is independent of the frequency $f$ and the material constant $k$.\n$$\\Delta_P = \\frac{(1 - v_{e})B_{\\text{bulk}}^{\\beta} + v_{e}B_{\\text{edge}}^{\\beta} - B_{\\text{bulk}}^{\\beta}}{B_{\\text{bulk}}^{\\beta}}$$\nSimplifying the numerator:\n$$\\Delta_P = \\frac{B_{\\text{bulk}}^{\\beta} - v_{e}B_{\\text{bulk}}^{\\beta} + v_{e}B_{\\text{edge}}^{\\beta} - B_{\\text{bulk}}^{\\beta}}{B_{\\text{bulk}}^{\\beta}}$$\n$$\\Delta_P = \\frac{v_{e}B_{\\text{edge}}^{\\beta} - v_{e}B_{\\text{bulk}}^{\\beta}}{B_{\\text{bulk}}^{\\beta}}$$\nFactoring out $v_e$ and simplifying the expression further:\n$$\\Delta_P = v_{e} \\left( \\frac{B_{\\text{edge}}^{\\beta}}{B_{\\text{bulk}}^{\\beta}} - 1 \\right) = v_{e} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{B_{\\text{edge}}}{B_{\\text{bulk}}}\\right)^{\\beta} - 1 \\right]$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this final symbolic expression: $v_{e} = 0.08$, $B_{\\text{edge}} = 0.16\\,\\text{T}$, $B_{\\text{bulk}} = 0.12\\,\\text{T}$, and $\\beta = 2.6$.\nThe ratio of flux densities is:\n$$\\frac{B_{\\text{edge}}}{B_{\\text{bulk}}} = \\frac{0.16}{0.12} = \\frac{4}{3}$$\nNow we compute $\\Delta_P$:\n$$\\Delta_P = 0.08 \\left[ \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^{2.6} - 1 \\right]$$\nCalculating the value of the term in parentheses:\n$$\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\right)^{2.6} \\approx (1.333333\\ldots)^{2.6} \\approx 2.1127435$$\nSubtracting $1$:\n$$2.1127435 - 1 = 1.1127435$$\nMultiplying by $v_{e}$:\n$$\\Delta_P = 0.08 \\times 1.1127435 \\approx 0.08901948$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The first four significant figures are $8$, $9$, $0$, and $1$. The fifth significant digit is $9$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$\\Delta_P \\approx 0.08902$$\nThis is the fractional increase in core loss due to the fringing flux effect.",
