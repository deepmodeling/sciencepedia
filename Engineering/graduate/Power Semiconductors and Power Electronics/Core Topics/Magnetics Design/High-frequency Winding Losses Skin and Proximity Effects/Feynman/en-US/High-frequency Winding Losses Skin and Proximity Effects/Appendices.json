By analyzing two parallel conductors with opposing currents—a ubiquitous configuration in transformers and inductors—you will derive from Maxwell's equations how the current distribution is radically altered compared to an isolated conductor.

            "problem": "Consider two identical, infinitely wide, parallel conducting strips of width $w$ and thickness $t$ made of a good conductor with conductivity $\\sigma$ and magnetic permeability $\\mu$ (take $\\mu \\approx \\mu_0$), separated by a uniform gap $g$. The strips are aligned along the $x$-axis, their broad faces are parallel to the $x$–$y$ plane, and their thickness extends along the $z$-axis. The two strips carry equal-magnitude, anti-phase time-harmonic currents along $x$ with angular frequency $\\omega$, so the macroscopic surface current densities (amperes per meter) on the two strips are $+K_x(t)=\\Re\\{K_0 \\exp(j\\omega t)\\}$ on one strip and $-K_x(t)=\\Re\\{K_0 \\exp(j\\omega t)\\}$ on the other, with $K_0$ a real amplitude. Assume the good-conductor and strong-skin-effect regime holds: the skin depth $\\delta = \\sqrt{2/(\\omega \\mu \\sigma)}$ satisfies $\\delta \\ll t$ and $\\delta \\ll g$, and displacement currents in the conductor can be neglected.\n\nStarting only from Maxwell’s equations, material constitutive relations, and boundary conditions, analyze the magnetic and electric fields in and around the strips to determine how the presence of the anti-phase neighbor distorts the current density distribution in each strip compared to an isolated strip carrying the same $K_0$. Quantify the distortion by identifying on which faces the current concentrates and by deriving the exponential skin-depth profile for the tangential current density inside each strip.\n\nThen, using Poynting’s theorem and the diffusion of fields in a good conductor, compute the average resistive power dissipation per unit width in one strip for both cases: (i) an isolated strip in free space carrying $K_x(t)=\\Re\\{K_0 \\exp(j\\omega t)\\}$, and (ii) one strip in the described two-strip anti-phase configuration carrying the same $K_0$. From these, determine the ratio of the alternating-current (AC) resistance per unit length of one strip in the anti-phase two-strip configuration to the AC resistance per unit length of the isolated strip. Express your final answer as a single dimensionless real number. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of electromagnetism, specifically Maxwell's equations and Poynting's theorem applied to good conductors at high frequencies. It is a well-posed problem with a clear, objective formulation and sufficient information for a unique solution under the specified approximations.\n\nWe begin from Maxwell's equations in the phasor domain for a time-harmonic field with angular frequency $\\omega$. For a good conductor, the conductivity $\\sigma$ is high, and we can neglect displacement currents ($\\sigma \\gg \\omega\\epsilon$).\nThe relevant equations are:\n1. Faraday's Law: $\\nabla \\times \\tilde{\\mathbf{E}} = -j\\omega\\mu\\tilde{\\mathbf{H}}$\n2. Ampere's Law: $\\nabla \\times \\tilde{\\mathbf{H}} = \\tilde{\\mathbf{J}} = \\sigma\\tilde{\\mathbf{E}}$\n\nTaking the curl of Ampere's law gives $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\tilde{\\mathbf{H}}) = \\nabla \\times (\\sigma\\tilde{\\mathbf{E}})$. Using the vector identity $\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{A}) = \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{A}) - \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{A}$ and noting that $\\nabla \\cdot \\tilde{\\mathbf{B}} = 0 \\implies \\nabla \\cdot \\tilde{\\mathbf{H}} = 0$, we get $-\\nabla^2 \\tilde{\\mathbf{H}} = \\sigma (\\nabla \\times \\tilde{\\mathbf{E}})$. Substituting Faraday's law yields the vector diffusion equation for the magnetic field:\n$$ \\nabla^2 \\tilde{\\mathbf{H}} = j\\omega\\mu\\sigma \\tilde{\\mathbf{H}} $$\nLet $k^2 = j\\omega\\mu\\sigma$. The propagation constant is $k = \\sqrt{j\\omega\\mu\\sigma} = \\sqrt{j} \\sqrt{\\omega\\mu\\sigma} = \\frac{1+j}{\\sqrt{2}}\\sqrt{\\omega\\mu\\sigma}$. Defining the skin depth as $\\delta = \\sqrt{2/(\\omega\\mu\\sigma)}$, we can write $k = (1+j)/\\delta$.\n\nThe problem geometry (infinitely wide strips) allows a one-dimensional analysis where fields vary only with the coordinate $z$, perpendicular to the strip faces. The current $\\tilde{J}_x$ is in the $x$-direction, which implies the magnetic field $\\tilde{H}_y$ is in the $y$-direction. The diffusion equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{d^2 \\tilde{H}_y(z)}{dz^2} = k^2 \\tilde{H}_y(z) $$\nThe current density is related to the magnetic field by Ampere's law, $\\tilde{\\mathbf{J}} = \\nabla \\times \\tilde{\\mathbf{H}}$. For our geometry, this gives $\\tilde{J}_x(z) = -\\frac{d\\tilde{H}_y(z)}{dz}$.\n\nThe average resistive power dissipation per unit area flowing into a conductor surface can be found from the complex Poynting vector, $\\tilde{\\mathbf{S}} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\tilde{\\mathbf{E}} \\times \\tilde{\\mathbf{H}}^*)$. For tangential fields at the surface, this simplifies to $P_{avg} = \\frac{1}{2}\\Re\\{\\tilde{E}_{tan} \\tilde{H}_{tan}^*\\}$. Using the concept of surface impedance for a good conductor, $Z_s = \\frac{\\tilde{E}_{tan}}{\\tilde{H}_{tan}} = \\frac{k}{\\sigma} = \\frac{1+j}{\\sigma\\delta}$, the power dissipated per unit area is:\n$$ P_{area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\Re\\{Z_s\\} |\\tilde{H}_{tan}|^2 = \\frac{1}{2\\sigma\\delta} |\\tilde{H}_{tan}|^2 $$\nHere, $\\Re\\{Z_s\\} = R_{sq} = 1/(\\sigma\\delta)$ is the surface resistance. The total power dissipated per unit length of a strip of width $w$ is found by integrating this power density over the surfaces of the strip.\n\nThe AC resistance per unit length, $R'_{AC}$, is defined by the relation for the total power dissipated per unit length, $P' = \\frac{1}{2} R'_{AC} |I_{peak}|^2$, where $I_{peak}$ is the peak total current flowing through the strip's cross-section. In our case, the macroscopic surface current density is $K_0$, so for a strip of width $w$, the total current is $I_{peak} = K_0 w$.\n\n**Case (i): Isolated Strip**\nAn isolated strip carries a total surface current density $K_0$. By symmetry, the current distributes evenly between the top and bottom surfaces. The magnetic field outside the strip must be consistent with this. Using an Ampere's loop around the strip, the difference in magnetic field from top to bottom is $K_0$. Symmetry dictates that the fields are equal and opposite. For a current in the $+x$ direction, the magnetic field is in the $-y$ direction above the strip and $+y$ direction below it. The boundary conditions for the magnetic field at the surfaces of a strip centered at $z=0$ and with thickness $t$ are:\n$$ \\tilde{H}_y(z=t/2) = -K_0/2 $$\n$$ \\tilde{H}_y(z=-t/2) = +K_0/2 $$\nThe total power dissipation per unit length, $P'_{iso}$, is the sum of contributions from the top and bottom surfaces. The tangential field magnitude is $|\\tilde{H}_{tan}| = K_0/2$ on both surfaces.\n$$ P'_{iso} = w \\left( P_{area, top} + P_{area, bot} \\right) = w \\left( \\frac{1}{2\\sigma\\delta} \\left|-\\frac{K_0}{2}\\right|^2 + \\frac{1}{2\\sigma\\delta} \\left|\\frac{K_0}{2}\\right|^2 \\right) $$\n$$ P'_{iso} = w \\cdot \\frac{1}{2\\sigma\\delta} \\left( \\frac{K_0^2}{4} + \\frac{K_0^2}{4} \\right) = \\frac{w K_0^2}{4\\sigma\\delta} $$\nThe AC resistance per unit length, $R'_{iso}$, is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} R'_{iso} (K_0 w)^2 = P'_{iso} \\implies R'_{iso} = \\frac{2 P'_{iso}}{(K_0 w)^2} = \\frac{2}{(K_0 w)^2} \\frac{w K_0^2}{4\\sigma\\delta} = \\frac{1}{2\\sigma\\delta w} $$\nIn this case, the current concentrates symmetrically on the outer and inner surfaces, decaying exponentially inwards with a characteristic length $\\delta$. This is the standard skin effect.\n\n**Case (ii): Anti-phase Two-Strip Configuration**\nWe have two strips carrying currents $+K_0$ (top strip) and $-K_0$ (bottom strip). The net current of the system is zero. By Ampere's law, the magnetic field outside the two-strip structure is zero.\nLet the top strip occupy $z \\in [g/2, g/2+t]$ and the bottom strip occupy $z \\in [-g/2-t, -g/2]$.\nFor the top strip carrying current $+K_0$:\n- The magnetic field above it ($z > g/2+t$) is $\\tilde{H}_y = 0$.\n- The magnetic field in the gap below it (but above the bottom strip, e.g. at $z=g/2$) can be found by applying Ampere's law to a loop enclosing only the top strip: $\\tilde{H}_{y,gap} - \\tilde{H}_{y,outer} = K_0$. With $\\tilde{H}_{y,outer}=0$, we get $\\tilde{H}_{y,gap} = K_0$.\nThe boundary conditions for the tangential magnetic field on the top conductor are:\n$$ \\tilde{H}_y(\\text{inner face, } z=g/2) = K_0 $$\n$$ \\tilde{H}_y(\\text{outer face, } z=g/2+t) = 0 $$\nThe condition $\\delta \\ll t$ ensures that the field at one face does not significantly influence the other through the conductor. Thus, all power dissipation occurs due to the field at the inner face.\nThe power dissipation per unit length, $P'_{prox}$, for the top strip is:\n$$ P'_{prox} = w \\left( P_{area, inner} + P_{area, outer} \\right) = w \\left( \\frac{1}{2\\sigma\\delta} |K_0|^2 + \\frac{1}{2\\sigma\\delta} |0|^2 \\right) = \\frac{w K_0^2}{2\\sigma\\delta} $$\nThe AC resistance per unit length for one strip in this configuration, $R'_{prox}$, is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} R'_{prox} (K_0 w)^2 = P'_{prox} \\implies R'_{prox} = \\frac{2 P'_{prox}}{(K_0 w)^2} = \\frac{2}{(K_0 w)^2} \\frac{w K_0^2}{2\\sigma\\delta} = \\frac{1}{\\sigma\\delta w} $$\n\n**Current Distribution Distortion (Proximity Effect)**\nFor the isolated strip, current is shared between the two surfaces. For the anti-phase strips, the presence of the opposing current in the neighboring strip attracts the current in the first strip. The magnetic field is cancelled on the outer face and reinforced on the inner face. As a result, the current is forced to flow almost entirely in a thin layer on the inner face (the one facing the other conductor). The current density profile, which is symmetric for the isolated strip, becomes highly asymmetric, concentrated at $z=g/2$ and decaying as $\\tilde{J}_x \\propto \\exp(-k(z-g/2))$. This phenomenon is the proximity effect.\n\n**Ratio of AC Resistances**\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the AC resistance per unit length in the anti-phase configuration to that of the isolated strip.\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{R'_{prox}}{R'_{iso}} = \\frac{1/(\\sigma\\delta w)}{1/(2\\sigma\\delta w)} $$\nAll common terms cancel:\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = 2 $$\nThe proximity effect, in this idealized case, doubles the AC resistance of the conductor compared to when it is isolated.",

Derivation of Volumetric Proximity-Loss Density**\n\nWe start with Maxwell-Faraday's law, $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E} = -\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}$. Given the uniform transverse field $\\mathbf{B}(t)=\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}\\,B_{z}(t)$, this implies that the induced electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ lies in the $x-y$ plane.

Integrating with respect to $x$ and using the symmetry condition that $E_y=0$ at the center of the foil ($x=0$) gives the induced electric field profile: $E_y(x) = -x \\frac{dB_z}{dt}$. By symmetry and charge conservation ($\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} = 0$), $E_x$ and $E_z$ are zero.\nThe problem is in the thin-sheet limit ($t \\ll \\delta$), so the magnetic field inside the conductor is approximately equal to the external applied field, $B_z(t)$.\n\nThe induced current density is given by the anisotropic constitutive relation $\\mathbf{J} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\mathbf{E}$.

Taking the curl of (3) gives $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{J} = \\sigma(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E})$. Using (1), this becomes $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{J} = -\\sigma \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}$.\nEquating the two expressions for $\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{J}$:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{\\mu} \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B} = -\\sigma \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t} \\implies \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{B} = \\mu\\sigma \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{B}}{\\partial t}\n$$\nSince $\\mathbf{J}$ is proportional to $\\mathbf{E}$ and is related to $\\mathbf{B}$ through Maxwell's equations, a similar diffusion-type equation holds for $\\mathbf{J}$. Taking the curl of (1) and substituting (2), (3), and (4):\n$$\n\\nabla \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{E}) = \\nabla(\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E}) - \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{E} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{B}) = -\\mu \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{H}) = -\\mu \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{J}}{\\partial t}\n$$\nFor a good conductor, charge density inside quickly dissipates, so $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{E} \\approx 0$. Substituting $\\mathbf{E} = \\mathbf{J}/\\sigma$:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\mathbf{J} = \\mu\\sigma \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{J}}{\\partial t}\n$$\nGiven the geometry ($t \\gg \\delta, w \\gg \\delta$), we can model the problem as one-dimensional, with the current density $\\mathbf{J} = J_x(z, t)\\mathbf{\\hat{x}}$ varying only with depth $z$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 J_x}{\\partial z^2} = \\mu\\sigma \\frac{\\partial J_x}{\\partial t}\n$$\nFor a sinusoidal current with angular frequency $\\omega$, we use complex phasors: $J_x(z, t) = \\text{Re}\\{\\hat{J}_x(z) e^{i\\omega t}\\}$. The equation for the phasor $\\hat{J}_x(z)$ becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 \\hat{J}_x}{dz^2} = i\\omega\\mu\\sigma \\hat{J}_x\n$$\nThis is a second-order ordinary differential equation with the solution $\\hat{J}_x(z) = C_1 e^{\\gamma z} + C_2 e^{-\\gamma z}$, where $\\gamma^2 = i\\omega\\mu\\sigma$.\nWe have $\\gamma = \\sqrt{i\\omega\\mu\\sigma} = \\sqrt{\\omega\\mu\\sigma} \\sqrt{i}$. Since $\\sqrt{i} = (1+i)/\\sqrt{2}$, we get:\n$$\n\\gamma = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega\\mu\\sigma}{2}}(1+i) = \\frac{1+i}{\\delta}\n$$\nwhere we have defined the skin depth $\\delta$ as:\n$$\n\\delta = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{\\omega\\mu\\sigma}}\n$$\nThe solution for the current density phasor is $\\hat{J}_x(z) = C_1 e^{(1+i)z/\\delta} + C_2 e^{-(1+i)z/\\delta}$. For a conductor extending in the positive $z$ direction ($z \\ge 0$), the current must decay with depth. Thus, $C_1=0$. Letting $J_0$ be the magnitude of the current density at the surface $z=0$, we have $C_2 = J_0$ (assuming a reference phase of 0).\n$$\n\\hat{J}_x(z) = J_0 e^{-(1+i)z/\\delta} = J_0 e^{-z/\\delta} e^{-iz/\\delta}\n$$\nThe magnitude of the current density is:\n$$\n|J(z)| = |\\hat{J}_x(z)| = J_0 e^{-z/\\delta}\n$$\n\nNext, we evaluate the quantity $\\mathcal{Q} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} |J(z)|^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}z$. The exact value is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{Q}_{\\text{exact}} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (J_0 e^{-z/\\delta})^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}z = J_0^2 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-2z/\\delta} \\,\\mathrm{d}z = J_0^2 \\left[-\\frac{\\delta}{2} e^{-2z/\\delta}\\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = J_0^2 \\frac{\\delta}{2}\n$$\nNow, we consider the numerical approximation. The domain $z \\ge 0$ is discretized into elements of size $h$. On each element $[kh, (k+1)h]$ for $k=0, 1, 2, \\dots$, the function $|J(z)|$ is approximated by a linear interpolant $|J_h(z)|$. The contribution to the approximate integral $\\mathcal{Q}_{\\text{approx}}$ from one such element is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{Q}_k = \\int_{kh}^{(k+1)h} |J_h(z)|^2 \\,\\mathrm{d}z\n$$\nLet $|J_k| = |J(kh)| = J_0 e^{-kh/\\delta}$ and $|J_{k+1}| = |J((k+1)h)| = J_0 e^{-(k+1)h/\\delta}$. The linear interpolant is $|J_h(z)| = |J_k| \\frac{(k+1)h-z}{h} + |J_{k+1}| \\frac{z-kh}{h}$. The integral evaluates to a standard finite element mass matrix form:\n$$\n\\mathcal{Q}_k = \\frac{h}{3} (|J_k|^2 + |J_k||J_{k+1}| + |J_{k+1}|^2)\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $|J_k|$ and $|J_{k+1}|$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{Q}_k = \\frac{h}{3} \\left( (J_0 e^{-kh/\\delta})^2 + (J_0 e^{-kh/\\delta})(J_0 e^{-(k+1)h/\\delta}) + (J_0 e^{-(k+1)h/\\delta})^2 \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{Q}_k = \\frac{h J_0^2}{3} e^{-2kh/\\delta} \\left( 1 + e^{-h/\\delta} + e^{-2h/\\delta} \\right)\n$$\nThe total approximate integral is the sum over all elements:\n$$\n\\mathcal{Q}_{\\text{approx}} = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\mathcal{Q}_k = \\frac{h J_0^2}{3} (1 + e^{-h/\\delta} + e^{-2h/\\delta}) \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (e^{-2h/\\delta})^k\n$$\nThe sum is a geometric series with ratio $r=e^{-2h/\\delta}$, so its value is $1/(1-r) = 1/(1-e^{-2h/\\delta})$.\n$$\n\\mathcal{Q}_{\\text{approx}} = \\frac{h J_0^2}{3} \\frac{1 + e^{-h/\\delta} + e^{-2h/\\delta}}{1 - e^{-2h/\\delta}}\n$$\nThe relative error is $E_{\\text{rel}} = (\\mathcal{Q}_{\\text{approx}} / \\mathcal{Q}_{\\text{exact}}) - 1$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathcal{Q}_{\\text{approx}}}{\\mathcal{Q}_{\\text{exact}}} = \\frac{\\frac{h J_0^2}{3} \\frac{1 + e^{-h/\\delta} + e^{-2h/\\delta}}{1 - e^{-2h/\\delta}}}{J_0^2 \\frac{\\delta}{2}} = \\frac{2h}{3\\delta} \\frac{1 + e^{-h/\\delta} + e^{-2h/\\delta}}{1 - e^{-2h/\\delta}}\n$$\nTo find the small-$h/\\delta$ asymptotics, let $x = h/\\delta$ and expand for small $x$:\n$$\ne^{-x} = 1 - x + \\frac{x^2}{2} - \\frac{x^3}{6} + O(x^4)\n$$\n$$\ne^{-2x} = 1 - 2x + 2x^2 - \\frac{4x^3}{3} + O(x^4)\n$$\nThe numerator term becomes:\n$$\n1 + e^{-x} + e^{-2x} = 1 + (1 - x + \\frac{x^2}{2} - \\dots) + (1 - 2x + 2x^2 - \\dots) = 3 - 3x + \\frac{5}{2}x^2 + O(x^3)\n$$\nThe denominator term is:\n$$\n1 - e^{-2x} = 1 - (1 - 2x + 2x^2 - \\frac{4}{3}x^3 + \\dots) = 2x - 2x^2 + \\frac{4}{3}x^3 + O(x^4)\n$$\nThe ratio becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{1 + e^{-x} + e^{-2x}}{1 - e^{-2x}} = \\frac{3 - 3x + \\frac{5}{2}x^2 + O(x^3)}{2x - 2x^2 + \\frac{4}{3}x^3 + O(x^4)} = \\frac{1}{2x} \\frac{3(1 - x + \\frac{5}{6}x^2 + \\dots)}{1 - x + \\frac{2}{3}x^2 + \\dots}\n$$\nPerforming polynomial long division on the remaining fraction:\n$$\n\\frac{1 - x + \\frac{5}{6}x^2 + \\dots}{1 - x + \\frac{2}{3}x^2 + \\dots} = 1 + \\left(\\frac{5}{6}-\\frac{2}{3}\\right)x^2 + O(x^3) = 1 + \\frac{1}{6}x^2 + O(x^3)\n$$\nSo, the full ratio is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2x} \\left( 3 \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{6}x^2 + O(x^3) \\right) \\right) = \\frac{3}{2x} + \\frac{1}{4}x + O(x^2)\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\mathcal{Q}_{\\text{approx}}/\\mathcal{Q}_{\\text{exact}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathcal{Q}_{\\text{approx}}}{\\mathcal{Q}_{\\text{exact}}} = \\frac{2x}{3} \\left( \\frac{3}{2x} + \\frac{1}{4}x + O(x^2) \\right) = 1 + \\frac{1}{6}x^2 + O(x^3)\n$$\nThe leading term of the relative error is:\n$$\nE_{\\text{rel}} = \\frac{\\mathcal{Q}_{\\text{approx}} - \\mathcal{Q}_{\\text{exact}}}{\\mathcal{Q}_{\\text{exact}}} \\approx \\frac{1}{6}x^2 = \\frac{1}{6}\\left(\\frac{h}{\\delta}\\right)^2\n$$\nThe problem requires this relative error to be no greater than a tolerance $\\varepsilon$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{6}\\left(\\frac{h}{\\delta}\\right)^2 \\le \\varepsilon\n$$\nSolving for $h$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{h}{\\delta}\\right)^2 \\le 6\\varepsilon \\implies \\frac{h}{\\delta} \\le \\sqrt{6\\varepsilon} \\implies h \\le \\delta \\sqrt{6\\varepsilon}\n$$\nTherefore, the maximum allowable element size $h_{\\max}$ is:\n$$\nh_{\\max} = \\delta \\sqrt{6\\varepsilon}\n$$",
