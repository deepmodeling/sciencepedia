The ratio is:\n$$ \\frac{t}{\\delta} = \\frac{5\\,\\mathrm{mm}}{29.1\\,\\mathrm{mm}} \\approx 0.172 $$\nThe field amplitude at a depth $z=t$ is given by $E(t) = E_0 e^{-t/\\delta}$. The ratio of the field at the back of the wall to the field at the front is:\n$$ \\frac{|E(t=5\\,\\mathrm{mm})|}{|E(z=0)|} = e^{-t/\\delta} = e^{-0.172} \\approx 0.842 $$\nThis means the field amplitude at the center of the core (assuming the wall is one side of the magnetic path) is about $84.2\\%$ of the value at the surface. Core loss mechanisms, particularly eddy current losses, are highly dependent on the field strength. The local eddy current power loss density is proportional to $|\\mathbf{J}|^2 = \\sigma^2 |\\mathbf{E}|^2$. At a depth $t$, the loss density is reduced by a factor of $(e^{-t/\\delta})^2 = e^{-2t/\\delta} = e^{-2 \\times 0.172} = e^{-0.344} \\approx 0.709$.\nThis corresponds to a reduction of approximately $29\\%$ in the local power dissipation at the center of the core wall compared to the surface. A model that assumes a uniform field (i.e., $\\delta \\gg t$) would use the surface field value throughout the volume, leading to an overestimation of the total eddy current losses. A local variation of nearly $30\\%$ in power dissipation is significant for accurate modeling of core losses in high-frequency power electronics. Therefore, the field nonuniformity is indeed an important concern and should not be neglected for precise analysis.",

Excess loss power: $P_e(f) = k_e f^{3/2}$\n\nSubstituting these into the total loss equation yields a linear model with respect to the unknown coefficients $\\mathbf{k} = [k_h, k_c, k_e]^T$:\n$$P_\\mathrm{tot}(f) = k_h f + k_c f^2 + k_e f^{3/2}$$\nGiven a dataset consisting of $n$ measurements of total power loss $P_{\\mathrm{tot}, i}$ at corresponding frequencies $f_i$, we can form a system of $n$ linear equations:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\nk_h f_1 + k_c f_1^2 + k_e f_1^{3/2} \\approx P_{\\mathrm{tot}, 1} \\\\\nk_h f_2 + k_c f_2^2 + k_e f_2^{3/2} \\approx P_{\\mathrm{tot}, 2} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nk_h f_n + k_c f_n^2 + k_e f_n^{3/2} \\approx P_{\\mathrm{tot}, n}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThis system can be expressed in matrix form as $A\\mathbf{k} \\approx \\mathbf{y}$, where:\n- $\\mathbf{k} = \\begin{pmatrix} k_h \\\\ k_c \\\\ k_e \\end{pmatrix}$ is the vector of coefficients to be determined.\n- $\\mathbf{y} = \\begin{pmatrix} P_{\\mathrm{tot}, 1} \\\\ P_{\\mathrm{tot}, 2} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ P_{\\mathrm{tot}, n} \\end{pmatrix}$ is the vector of measured power loss values.\n- $A$ is the $n \\times 3$ design matrix, whose columns are the basis functions evaluated at each frequency $f_i$:\n$$A = \\begin{pmatrix}\nf_1 & f_1^2 & f_1^{3/2} \\\\\nf_2 & f_2^2 & f_2^{3/2} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\\nf_n & f_n^2 & f_n^{3/2}\n\\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe task is to find the coefficient vector $\\mathbf{k}$ that provides the \"best fit\" to the data. This is achieved by the method of linear least squares, which seeks to find the vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{k}}$ that minimizes the sum of the squares of the differences between the observed values $y_i$ and the values predicted by the model, $\\hat{y}_i = (A\\mathbf{k})_i$. This is equivalent to minimizing the squared Euclidean norm of the residual vector, $\\| A\\mathbf{k} - \\mathbf{y} \\|_2^2$.\n\nThe solution to this minimization problem is given by the normal equations:\n$$(A^T A) \\hat{\\mathbf{k}} = A^T \\mathbf{y}$$\nProvided that the matrix $A^T A$ is invertible (which is true if the columns of $A$ are linearly independent, as is the case here for distinct positive frequencies), the unique least-squares estimate for the coefficients is:\n$$\\hat{\\mathbf{k}} = (A^T A)^{-1} A^T \\mathbf{y}$$\nThe matrix $(A^T A)^{-1} A^T$ is known as the pseudoinverse of $A$. This calculation is efficiently and accurately performed using numerical linear algebra libraries, such as `numpy.linalg.lstsq` in Python.\n\nFor each test case, the procedure is as follows:\n1.  Construct the design matrix $A$ and the measurement vector $\\mathbf{y}$ from the given frequencies $f$ (in $\\mathrm{kHz}$) and total power losses $P_\\mathrm{tot}$ (in $\\mathrm{mW/cm^3}$).\n2.  Solve the linear least-squares problem $A\\mathbf{k} \\approx \\mathbf{y}$ to obtain the estimated coefficients $\\hat{\\mathbf{k}} = [\\hat{k}_h, \\hat{k}_c, \\hat{k}_e]^T$.\n3.  Round the estimated coefficients to six decimal places for reporting.\n4.  Identify the maximum frequency $f_\\mathrm{max}$ in the dataset.\n5.  Calculate the individual power loss contributions at this maximum frequency using the (unrounded) estimated coefficients:\n    - $P_h = \\hat{k}_h f_\\mathrm{max}$\n    - $P_c = \\hat{k}_c f_\\mathrm{max}^2$\n    - $P_e = \\hat{k}_e f_\\mathrm{max}^{3/2}$\n6.  Determine the dominant loss mechanism by finding which of the three components has the largest absolute value, $|P_h|$, $|P_c|$, or $|P_e|$. The result is reported as an index $d \\in \\{0, 1, 2\\}$, corresponding to hysteresis, classical eddy current, and excess loss, respectively.\n\nThis procedure is applied to each of the three provided test datasets to generate the final output.",
