            "problem": "A three-phase, two-level Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) with direct-current bus voltage $V_{dc}$ supplies a balanced, star-connected load without neutral. The inverter is operated under three distinct modulation regimes: (i) six-step square-wave gating, (ii) Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM), and (iii) Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (SVPWM). In all cases, consider steady-state balanced operation producing a sinusoidal fundamental at electrical angular frequency $\\omega$.\n\nStarting from first principles, perform the following derivations:\n\n1. For six-step operation, model each phase pole voltage as an ideal bipolar square wave with amplitude $\\pm V_{dc}/2$ and $120^{\\circ}$ phase displacement. Using Fourier series of a bipolar square wave and the relation between phase and line-to-line fundamentals in a balanced three-phase system, derive the peak amplitude of the fundamental line-to-line voltage $v_{ab}(t)$ in terms of $V_{dc}$. Then define an equivalent modulation index $m$ as $m \\equiv \\frac{2\\,V_{a1,\\text{peak}}}{V_{dc}}$, where $V_{a1,\\text{peak}}$ is the peak amplitude of the fundamental phase voltage, and express $V_{ab1,\\text{peak}}$ solely in terms of $V_{dc}$.\n\n2. For Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM), let the three sinusoidal references be of peak amplitude proportional to a scalar modulation index $m$ such that the average pole voltage follows the reference in the linear regime. Starting from the definition that the average phase pole voltage equals the direct-current bus scaled by the instantaneous duty ratio, and that the duty ratio is centered around $1/2$ with a sinusoidal deviation proportional to $m$, derive the relation between $m$ and the peak amplitude of the fundamental phase voltage $V_{a1,\\text{peak}}$ in the linear region. From this, obtain the peak line-to-line fundamental $V_{ab1,\\text{peak}}$ at the upper boundary of linear SPWM.\n\n3. For Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (SVPWM), model the set of available inverter voltage space vectors forming a regular hexagon in the complex plane.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of power electronics and three-phase circuit theory, is well-posed with a clear objective, and contains no factual errors, contradictions, or ambiguities.\n\nThe analysis proceeds by deriving the peak fundamental line-to-line voltage for each of the three specified modulation schemes. The DC bus voltage is $V_{dc}$, and the inverter has a bipolar output, with pole voltages switching between $+\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$ and $-\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$ with respect to a virtual DC link center point, denoted '0'. The load is star-connected without a neutral wire, implying that the sum of the instantaneous phase-to-neutral voltages is zero: $v_{AN}(t) + v_{BN}(t) + v_{CN}(t) = 0$.\n\n**1. Six-Step Square-Wave Operation**\n\nIn this mode, the phase pole voltages $v_{A0}(t)$, $v_{B0}(t)$, and $v_{C0}(t)$ are ideal bipolar square waves of amplitude $\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$, phase-shifted by $120^{\\circ}$ or $\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ radians. The Fourier series for a bipolar square wave $v(t)$ with amplitude $V_m$ and zero average value is given by:\n$$v(t) = \\frac{4V_m}{\\pi} \\sum_{n=1,3,5,...}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n} \\sin(n\\omega t)$$\nFor the pole voltage of phase A, the amplitude is $V_m = \\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$. Thus, its Fourier series is:\n$$v_{A0}(t) = \\frac{4(V_{dc}/2)}{\\pi} \\sum_{n=1,3,5,...}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n} \\sin(n\\omega t) = \\frac{2V_{dc}}{\\pi} \\sum_{n=1,3,5,...}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n} \\sin(n\\omega t)$$\nThe fundamental component ($n=1$) of the pole voltage for phase A is:\n$$v_{A0,1}(t) = \\frac{2V_{dc}}{\\pi} \\sin(\\omega t)$$\nThe peak amplitude of the fundamental pole voltage is $V_{A0,1,\\text{peak}} = \\frac{2V_{dc}}{\\pi}$.\n\nThe load phase-to-neutral voltage, $v_{AN}(t)$, is related to the pole voltage $v_{A0}(t)$ and the voltage of the load's neutral point 'N' with respect to the DC link center '0', $v_{N0}(t)$, by $v_{AN}(t) = v_{A0}(t) - v_{N0}(t)$. Due to the balanced load, $v_{N0}(t) = \\frac{1}{3}(v_{A0}(t) + v_{B0}(t) + v_{C0}(t))$.\nFor non-triplen odd harmonics ($n=1, 5, 7, 11, ...$), the three phase-shifted components sum to zero, so $v_{N0,n}(t) = 0$ and $v_{AN,n}(t) = v_{A0,n}(t)$. For triplen odd harmonics ($n=3, 9, 15, ...$), the components are in phase, so $v_{N0,n}(t) = v_{A0,n}(t)$, which results in $v_{AN,n}(t) = 0$.\nTherefore, the fundamental component of the phase-to-neutral voltage is identical to that of the pole voltage:\n$$V_{a1,\\text{peak}} = V_{AN,1,\\text{peak}} = V_{A0,1,\\text{peak}} = \\frac{2V_{dc}}{\\pi}$$\nFor a balanced three-phase system, the peak amplitude of the fundamental line-to-line voltage is $\\sqrt{3}$ times the peak amplitude of the fundamental phase-to-neutral voltage.\n$$V_{ab1,\\text{peak}}^{\\text{six-step}} = \\sqrt{3} \\, V_{a1,\\text{peak}} = \\sqrt{3} \\left(\\frac{2V_{dc}}{\\pi}\\right) = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{\\pi} V_{dc}$$\nThe problem defines an equivalent modulation index $m \\equiv \\frac{2\\,V_{a1,\\text{peak}}}{V_{dc}}$. For six-step operation, this is $m = \\frac{2}{V_{dc}} \\left(\\frac{2V_{dc}}{\\pi}\\right) = \\frac{4}{\\pi}$. This is a constant value characteristic of this mode.\n\n**2. Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM)**\n\nIn SPWM, a sinusoidal reference voltage is compared with a high-frequency triangular carrier wave. The average pole voltage over a switching period, $\\langle v_{A0}(t) \\rangle$, tracks the sinusoidal reference. Let the reference for phase A be $v_{ref,A}(t) = m \\cdot V_{ref\\_max} \\sin(\\omega t)$, where $m$ is the modulation index and $V_{ref\\_max}$ is the peak of the reference at $m=1$. In this scheme, the average pole voltage is given by:\n$$\\langle v_{A0}(t) \\rangle = m \\frac{V_{dc}}{2} \\sin(\\omega t)$$\nThis relation shows that the fundamental component of the pole voltage has a peak amplitude directly proportional to the modulation index $m$:\n$$V_{A0,1,\\text{peak}} = m \\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$$\nThe linear region of SPWM is defined by $m \\le 1$. At the upper boundary of this region, $m=1$.\nAt $m=1$, the peak fundamental phase-to-neutral voltage is:\n$$V_{a1,\\text{peak}} = V_{A0,1,\\text{peak}} = (1) \\frac{V_{dc}}{2} = \\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$$\nThe corresponding peak fundamental line-to-line voltage is:\n$$V_{ab1,\\text{peak}}^{\\text{SPWM,lin}} = \\sqrt{3} \\, V_{a1,\\text{peak}} = \\sqrt{3} \\frac{V_{dc}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} V_{dc}$$\n\n**3. Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (SVPWM)**\n\nSVPWM considers the inverter's eight possible switching states. Six of these states produce non-zero voltage vectors (active vectors), and two produce zero vectors. The active vectors are defined using the Clarke transformation, $\\vec{v} = \\frac{2}{3}(v_{an} + v_{bn} e^{j2\\pi/3} + v_{cn} e^{j4\\pi/3})$.\nFor a switching state such as $(1,0,0)$, where phase A is connected to $+\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$ and phases B, C to $-\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$, the phase-to-neutral voltages are $v_{an}=\\frac{2}{3}V_{dc}$, $v_{bn}=-\\frac{1}{3}V_{dc}$, $v_{cn}=-\\frac{1}{3}V_{dc}$. The corresponding space vector $\\vec{v}_1$ is:\n$$\\vec{v}_1 = \\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\frac{2}{3}V_{dc} - \\frac{1}{3}V_{dc} e^{j2\\pi/3} - \\frac{1}{3}V_{dc} e^{j4\\pi/3}\\right) = \\frac{2}{9}V_{dc}\\left(2 - (e^{j2\\pi/3} + e^{j4\\pi/3})\\right) = \\frac{2}{9}V_{dc}(2 - (-1)) = \\frac{2}{3}V_{dc}$$\nThis vector lies along the real axis. There are five other active vectors with the same magnitude, $|\\vec{v}_k| = \\frac{2}{3}V_{dc}$, spaced $60^\\circ$ apart. These six vectors form the vertices of a regular hexagon in the complex plane.\nA rotating reference vector $\\vec{v}_{ref}$ is synthesized by time-averaging the adjacent stationary vectors. The magnitude of this reference vector is equal to the peak phase voltage, $|\\vec{v}_{ref}| = V_{a1,\\text{peak}}$.\nLinear modulation is maintained as long as the reference vector trajectory is contained within the hexagon. The maximum-amplitude sinusoidal output is achieved when the circular trajectory of $\\vec{v}_{ref}$ is the largest circle that can be inscribed within the hexagon. The radius of this circle is equal to the apothem of the hexagon. For a hexagon with vertices at a distance $R$ from the center, the apothem is $a_p = R \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\nHere, $R = \\frac{2}{3}V_{dc}$. The maximum magnitude of the reference vector is:\n$$|\\vec{v}_{ref}|_{\\text{max}} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}V_{dc}\\right) \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\frac{V_{dc}}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\nThis is the maximum peak fundamental phase-to-neutral voltage in the linear SVPWM region:\n$$V_{a1,\\text{peak}}^{\\text{SVPWM,lin}} = \\frac{V_{dc}}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\nThe corresponding peak fundamental line-to-line voltage is:\n$$V_{ab1,\\text{peak}}^{\\text{SVPWM,lin}} = \\sqrt{3} \\, V_{a1,\\text{peak}}^{\\text{SVPWM,lin}} = \\sqrt{3} \\left(\\frac{V_{dc}}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = V_{dc}$$\n\n**Final Comparison**\n\nThe problem requires reporting the normalized peak line-to-line fundamental amplitudes, $[\\,V_{ab1,\\text{peak}}^{\\text{SPWM,lin}}/V_{dc}\\,,\\,V_{ab1,\\text{peak}}^{\\text{SVPWM,lin}}/V_{dc}\\,,\\,V_{ab1,\\text{peak}}^{\\text{six-step}}/V_{dc}\\,]$.\nUsing the derived results:\n- SPWM (linear limit): $\\frac{V_{ab1,\\text{peak}}^{\\text{SPWM,lin}}}{V_{dc}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$\n- SVPWM (linear limit): $\\frac{V_{ab1,\\text{peak}}^{\\text{SVPWM,lin}}}{V_{dc}} = 1$\n- Six-step: $\\frac{V_{ab1,\\text{peak}}^{\\text{six-step}}}{V_{dc}} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{\\pi}$\n\nThe final result is the row matrix of these dimensionless values.",

            "introduction": "Having established that SVPWM achieves a higher output voltage, this practice explores precisely how it does so. By analyzing the instantaneous common-mode voltage from first principles, you will uncover the subtle but powerful mechanism that distinguishes SVPWM from SPWM .

            "problem": "A $3$-phase, $2$-level voltage-source inverter feeding a balanced wye-connected load with isolated neutral is supplied by a direct current (DC) link of total voltage $V_{dc}$, realized as two equal capacitors in series so that the midpoint node $n$ is at $+V_{dc}/2$ relative to the negative rail and $-V_{dc}/2$ relative to the positive rail, under ideal conditions. Each inverter leg employs ideal switches that connect the corresponding phase pole to either the positive rail or the negative rail. Let the leg switching functions be $S_{a}, S_{b}, S_{c} \\in \\{0,1\\}$, where $S_{x}=1$ denotes connection of phase pole $x \\in \\{a,b,c\\}$ to $+V_{dc}/2$ and $S_{x}=0$ denotes connection to $-V_{dc}/2$. Denote the instantaneous pole (leg) voltages to the DC-link midpoint by $v_{an}, v_{bn}, v_{cn}$, so that $v_{xn} = +V_{dc}/2$ when $S_{x}=1$ and $v_{xn} = -V_{dc}/2$ when $S_{x}=0$. Define the instantaneous common-mode voltage as $v_{cm} = \\left(v_{an} + v_{bn} + v_{cn}\\right)/3$.\n\nAt an instant representative of a Space Vector Modulation (SVM) active-vector interval, the switching state is $S_{a}=1$, $S_{b}=0$, $S_{c}=1$.

Then, using first principles, justify how this common-mode term participates in forming the instantaneous load phase voltages $v_{ao}, v_{bo}, v_{co}$ (with respect to the floating load neutral $o$) and why it cancels in the instantaneous line-to-line voltages $v_{ab}, v_{bc}, v_{ca}$. In your justification, explicitly connect these observations to the structural differences between Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM) and Space Vector Modulation (SVM) in terms of their common-mode voltage shaping and its implications for phase versus line voltage waveforms.\n\nProvide your final result for $v_{cm}$ as a simplified closed-form expression in terms of $V_{dc}$. Express the final answer in volts. No numerical rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. It describes a standard configuration in power electronics and asks for a derivation and justification based on fundamental principles. All necessary information is provided.\n\nThe first step is to determine the instantaneous common-mode voltage $v_{cm}$ for the specified switching state. The problem defines the system and the relevant variables.\nThe total DC link voltage is $V_{dc}$. The DC link is center-tapped at point $n$, so the positive rail is at a potential of $+V_{dc}/2$ with respect to $n$, and the negative rail is at $-V_{dc}/2$ with respect to $n$.\nThe switching function $S_x$ for phase $x \\in \\{a,b,c\\}$ determines the connection of the phase pole to the DC rails.\nIf $S_x = 1$, the pole is connected to the positive rail, and the pole voltage with respect to the midpoint $n$ is $v_{xn} = +V_{dc}/2$.\nIf $S_x = 0$, the pole is connected to the negative rail, and the pole voltage is $v_{xn} = -V_{dc}/2$.\nThis relationship can be expressed compactly as $v_{xn} = V_{dc}(S_x - 1/2)$.\n\nThe problem specifies the switching state at a particular instant as $S_a=1$, $S_b=0$, and $S_c=1$. This corresponds to the active voltage vector $V_5$ in standard space vector notation.\nFor this state, the individual pole voltages are:\n$v_{an} = V_{dc}(S_a - 1/2) = V_{dc}(1 - 1/2) = +\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$\n$v_{bn} = V_{dc}(S_b - 1/2) = V_{dc}(0 - 1/2) = -\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$\n$v_{cn} = V_{dc}(S_c - 1/2) = V_{dc}(1 - 1/2) = +\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$\n\nThe instantaneous common-mode voltage $v_{cm}$ is defined as the average of the three pole voltages:\n$v_{cm} = \\frac{v_{an} + v_{bn} + v_{cn}}{3}$\nSubstituting the calculated values for the given state:\n$v_{cm} = \\frac{(+V_{dc}/2) + (-V_{dc}/2) + (+V_{dc}/2)}{3} = \\frac{V_{dc}/2}{3} = \\frac{V_{dc}}{6}$\n\nNext, we must justify, using first principles, the role of this common-mode voltage.\nThe system consists of the inverter and a balanced, wye-connected load with an isolated neutral point, denoted as $o$.\nThe instantaneous phase voltage across the load for phase $x$ is $v_{xo}$, where $x \\in \\{a,b,c\\}$. Applying Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) to a loop from the DC link midpoint $n$, through the inverter leg $x$, through the load phase $x$, to the load neutral $o$, and back to $n$, we obtain:\n$v_{xn} - v_{xo} - v_{on} = 0$\nwhere $v_{on}$ is the voltage of the load neutral point $o$ with respect to the DC link midpoint $n$.\nThis can be rearranged to express the load phase voltage as:\n$v_{xo} = v_{xn} - v_{on}$\n\nSince the load neutral is isolated, there is no path for zero-sequence current to flow. The sum of the instantaneous phase currents must be zero:\n$i_a + i_b + i_c = 0$\nThe load is balanced, meaning the impedance of each phase is identical. Let this be represented by an operator $Z_{load}$ (which could be a simple resistance $R$ or a more complex impedance $R+L\\frac{d}{dt}$). The phase voltages are related to the phase currents by $v_{xo} = Z_{load}[i_x]$.\nSumming the phase voltages across the load:\n$v_{ao} + v_{bo} + v_{co} = Z_{load}[i_a] + Z_{load}[i_b] + Z_{load}[i_c] = Z_{load}[i_a + i_b + i_c]$\nSince the sum of currents is zero, the sum of the instantaneous load phase voltages must also be zero:\n$v_{ao} + v_{bo} + v_{co} = 0$\n\nNow, we sum the KVL equations for all three phases:\n$\\sum_{x=a,b,c} v_{xo} = \\sum_{x=a,b,c} (v_{xn} - v_{on})$\n$(v_{ao} + v_{bo} + v_{co}) = (v_{an} + v_{bn} + v_{cn}) - 3v_{on}$\nSubstituting the previous result that the sum of load phase voltages is zero:\n$0 = (v_{an} + v_{bn} + v_{cn}) - 3v_{on}$\nSolving for $v_{on}$:\n$v_{on} = \\frac{v_{an} + v_{bn} + v_{cn}}{3}$\nThis expression is precisely the definition of the common-mode voltage $v_{cm}$. Therefore, $v_{on} = v_{cm}$.\n\nThis demonstrates how the common-mode voltage participates in forming the load phase voltages. The voltage of the load's floating neutral with respect to the DC link's midpoint is equal to the inverter's common-mode voltage. The instantaneous load phase voltage $v_{xo}$ is the difference between the inverter pole voltage $v_{xn}$ and this common-mode voltage:\n$v_{xo} = v_{xn} - v_{cm}$\nThe common-mode voltage is thus subtracted from each pole voltage to yield the voltage that actually appears across the load terminals.\n\nNext, we examine why the common-mode voltage cancels in the instantaneous line-to-line voltages. The line-to-line voltage, for example $v_{ab}$, is defined as the potential difference between phase pole $a$ and phase pole $b$. This is equivalent to the difference in load phase voltages.\n$v_{ab} = v_{ao} - v_{bo}$\nUsing the expression for phase voltage derived above:\n$v_{ab} = (v_{an} - v_{on}) - (v_{bn} - v_{on})$\n$v_{ab} = v_{an} - v_{on} - v_{bn} + v_{on}$\n$v_{ab} = v_{an} - v_{bn}$\nSimilarly for the other line-to-line voltages:\n$v_{bc} = v_{bn} - v_{cn}$\n$v_{ca} = v_{cn} - v_{an}$\nThe term $v_{on} = v_{cm}$ is eliminated in the subtraction. This shows that the line-to-line voltages are determined solely by the differences between the inverter pole voltages and are independent of the common-mode voltage.\n\nFinally, we connect these observations to the structural differences between Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM) and Space Vector Modulation (SVM).\nThe fundamental goal of modulation is to produce a desired set of fundamental-frequency sinusoidal output voltages. The difference between SPWM and SVM lies in how the instantaneous pole voltages $v_{an}, v_{bn}, v_{cn}$ are generated to achieve this goal.\n\nIn conventional SPWM, each inverter leg is modulated independently by comparing a sinusoidal reference waveform with a high-frequency triangular carrier wave. This method implicitly defines the pole voltages. The resulting common-mode voltage $v_{cm}$ is an artifact of this process; it is not deliberately shaped. The instantaneous phase-to-neutral load voltages $v_{xo}$ have a waveform that appears sinusoidal, overlaid with high-frequency switching ripple, because the common-mode voltage in SPWM is primarily high-frequency content.\n\nIn SVM, the three phase legs are treated as a single entity. The inverter is seen as generating one of eight discrete voltage vectors in the complex plane. A desired reference voltage vector is synthesized by time-averaging adjacent vectors (typically two active vectors and one or both zero vectors) over a switching period. SVM has a degree of freedom in choosing the zero vectors ($[000]$ or $[111]$), which produce different common-mode voltages ($v_{cm} = -V_{dc}/2$ and $v_{cm} = +V_{dc}/2$, respectively) but identical (zero) line-to-line voltages. SVM exploits this freedom to inject a specific low-frequency common-mode signal into the pole voltage references. A common approach is to add a zero-sequence signal that centers the three-phase reference waveforms, thereby maximizing the use of the available DC link voltage. This injected common-mode signal makes the instantaneous pole voltage waveforms $v_{xn}$ non-sinusoidal. Consequently, the instantaneous load phase voltages $v_{xo} = v_{xn} - v_{cm}$ also become non-sinusoidal (they contain harmonics, primarily the third harmonic and its multiples).\n\nHowever, as we have proven, this injected common-mode voltage cancels out completely in the line-to-line voltages. The line-to-line voltages $v_{ab}, v_{bc}, v_{ca}$ remain functions only of the differences between the pole voltages, which are controlled to produce pure sinusoidal fundamental components. By deliberately \"distorting\" the phase voltages with a common-mode signal, SVM can achieve a larger fundamental amplitude for the line-to-line voltages compared to SPWM for the same DC link voltage $V_{dc}$ (approximately a $15.5\\%$ increase in the linear modulation range). This is the primary advantage of SVM over SPWM in terms of DC bus utilization. Although the instantaneous load phase voltage waveforms differ significantly between the two methods due to the different $v_{cm}$ profiles, the resulting fundamental line-to-line voltages are what matters for most three-phase AC loads, and SVM generates them more effectively.",

The maximum fundamental phase peak amplitude is at $m_{a}=1$, giving $A_{1,\\max,\\mathrm{SPWM}} = \\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$. For a balanced three-phase system, the line-to-line voltage peak amplitude is $\\sqrt{3}$ times the phase voltage peak amplitude.\n$$V_{LL,\\mathrm{peak},\\mathrm{SPWM}} = \\sqrt{3} A_{1,\\max,\\mathrm{SPWM}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}V_{dc}}{2}$$\n\nNext, we analyze SVM. SVM operates by synthesizing a reference voltage vector, $\\mathbf{v}_{ref}$, by time-averaging the discrete switching state vectors of the inverter. There are six non-zero (active) vectors and two zero vectors. In the stationary $\\alpha\\beta$ reference frame, the six active vectors form a regular hexagon. The magnitude of these vectors (which are the vertices of the hexagon) is $\\frac{2}{3}V_{dc}$. The reference vector $\\mathbf{v}_{ref}$ rotates at the fundamental frequency $\\omega_{1}$.\n\nFor linear modulation, the locus of the tip of $\\mathbf{v}_{ref}$ must remain inside this hexagon. The maximum balanced sinusoidal output voltage corresponds to the largest circular trajectory that can be inscribed within the hexagon. The radius of this inscribed circle is the apothem of the hexagon. The distance from the origin to any vertex is $R = \\frac{2}{3}V_{dc}$. The apothem, $r_{in}$, is given by $r_{in} = R \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3}V_{dc} \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\frac{V_{dc}}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\n\nThe magnitude of the reference vector, $|\\mathbf{v}_{ref}|$, is equal to the peak amplitude of the synthesized fundamental phase voltage, $A_{1}$. Thus, the maximum fundamental phase peak amplitude for SVM in the linear region is:\n$$A_{1,\\max,\\mathrm{SVM}} = \\frac{V_{dc}}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\nThe corresponding maximum line-to-line peak amplitude is:\n$$V_{LL,\\mathrm{peak},\\mathrm{SVM}} = \\sqrt{3} A_{1,\\max,\\mathrm{SVM}} = \\sqrt{3} \\left(\\frac{V_{dc}}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = V_{dc}$$\n\nThe ratio of the maximum achievable line-to-line peak amplitude in SVM to that in SPWM is:\n$$\\frac{V_{LL,\\mathrm{peak},\\mathrm{SVM}}}{V_{LL,\\mathrm{peak},\\mathrm{SPWM}}} = \\frac{V_{dc}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3}V_{dc}}{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\nSVM allows for a voltage approximately $15.5\\%$ higher than SPWM because it makes more efficient use of the DC bus voltage by implicitly adding a zero-sequence component to the phase references, which flattens their peaks and allows for higher fundamental amplitude before saturation occurs.\n\n**3. Baseband THD**\n\nThe Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) is defined as the ratio of the RMS value of all harmonic components to the RMS value of the fundamental component. The problem specifies a baseband THD, calculated after applying an ideal low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency $f_{c,\\mathrm{LP}}$ satisfying $f_{1} < f_{c,\\mathrm{LP}} < f_{c} - f_{1}$.\n\nThe frequency spectrum of a voltage waveform generated by ideal naturally-sampled SPWM consists of:\n1.  The desired fundamental component at frequency $f_{1}$.\n2.  Harmonic components clustered around multiples of the carrier frequency, $f_{c}$. These harmonics appear at frequencies $m f_{c} \\pm k f_{1}$, where $m$ and $k$ are integers. For a centered triangular carrier, the condition is that $m+k$ must be odd.\n\nCritically, under these ideal conditions, there are no harmonics at integer multiples of the fundamental frequency in the baseband (e.g., $2f_{1}, 3f_{1}, ...$), and no sub-harmonics (harmonics at frequencies below $f_{1}$). All distortion components are shifted to high frequencies.\n\nThe specified filter cutoff $f_{c,\\mathrm{LP}}$ is greater than the fundamental frequency $f_{1}$, so the fundamental component passes through. The cutoff is also strictly less than $f_{c} - f_{1}$. The lowest-frequency harmonic group is centered at $f_{c}$. The frequencies in this group are of the form $f_{c} \\pm k f_{1}$. The lowest possible frequency in this group is greater than or equal to $f_{c} - k_{max}f_1$. Since the filter cuts off all frequencies above $f_{c,\\mathrm{LP}} < f_{c} - f_{1}$, it is guaranteed to remove all carrier-related harmonics.\n\nAs there are no other harmonics in the baseband for ideal SPWM, the filtered phase voltage contains only the fundamental component. Therefore, the sum of the squares of all other harmonic amplitudes is zero.\n$$\\mathrm{THD}_{\\mathrm{base}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\sum_{h \\neq 1, f_h < f_{c,\\mathrm{LP}}} V_{h,rms}^2}}{V_{1,rms}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{0}}{V_{1,rms}} = 0$$\nNo baseband harmonics (other than the fundamental) remain.\n\n**4. Final Numerical Calculation**\n\nThe problem asks for the computation of the performance metric $Q$:\n$$Q \\equiv \\frac{A_{1}/V_{dc}}{\\sqrt{1 + \\mathrm{THD}_{\\mathrm{base}}^{2}}}$$\nWe are given $V_{dc} = 600\\ \\mathrm{V}$ and $m_{a} = 0.9$.\n\nFrom Part 1, the SPWM phase fundamental peak amplitude is:\n$$A_{1} = m_{a} \\frac{V_{dc}}{2} = 0.9 \\times \\frac{600}{2} = 0.9 \\times 300 = 270\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\nThe ratio $A_{1}/V_{dc}$ is:\n$$\\frac{A_{1}}{V_{dc}} = \\frac{270}{600} = \\frac{27}{60} = \\frac{9}{20} = 0.45$$\nAlternatively, $A_{1}/V_{dc} = \\left(m_{a} \\frac{V_{dc}}{2}\\right) / V_{dc} = \\frac{m_{a}}{2} = \\frac{0.9}{2} = 0.45$.\n\nFrom Part 3, we found that for ideal SPWM and the specified filter, the baseband THD is zero:\n$$\\mathrm{THD}_{\\mathrm{base}} = 0$$\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $Q$:\n$$Q = \\frac{0.45}{\\sqrt{1 + 0^{2}}} = \\frac{0.45}{1} = 0.45$$\nThe result is an exact value, so no rounding is necessary.",
