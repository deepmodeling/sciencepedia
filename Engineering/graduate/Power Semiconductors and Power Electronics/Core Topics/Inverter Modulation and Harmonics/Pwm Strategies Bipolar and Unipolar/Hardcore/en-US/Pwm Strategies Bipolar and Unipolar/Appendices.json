This first exercise guides you through deriving the fundamental condition to avoid overmodulation, a state where the inverter loses its ability to produce a controlled sinusoidal output. By working from first principles, you will establish the operational limits of Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM) and define the critical role of the amplitude modulation index, $m_{a}$ .",

            "problem": "A single-phase full-bridge voltage source inverter is modulated using Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM). An ideal comparator compares a sinusoidal reference voltage $v_{r}(t) = M \\sin(\\omega_{m} t)$ with a symmetric triangular carrier $v_{c}(t)$ of angular frequency $\\omega_{c}$, with $\\omega_{c} \\gg \\omega_{m}$. The carrier is centered at zero and swings between $-V_{c}$ and $+V_{c}$ each period. In bipolar SPWM, a single comparator generates the switching function for the full-bridge to produce output states $+V_{\\mathrm{dc}}$ and $-V_{\\mathrm{dc}}$. In unipolar SPWM, each leg is modulated independently using references $+v_{r}(t)$ and $-v_{r}(t)$ against the same carrier to produce pole voltages that switch between $\\pm V_{\\mathrm{dc}}/2$, and the line-to-line voltage is the difference of the two pole voltages.\n\nUsing only the principle that, over each carrier period, an ideal comparator yields a pulse whose width equals the measure of time within the period during which the reference exceeds the carrier, derive from first principles the condition on the ratio of the reference to the carrier required to avoid overmodulation (i.e., to prevent saturation of the pulse width at $0$ or $1$ at any time). Apply this derivation to both bipolar and unipolar SPWM and show that the same bound applies to the sinusoidal reference amplitude.\n\nDefine the amplitude modulation index as $m_{a} \\triangleq M / V_{c}$. Using your derivation, relate the no-overmodulation condition to $m_{a}$.\n\nFinally, determine the analytic expression for the minimum carrier peak amplitude $V_{c,\\min}$ required to avoid overmodulation for a given sinusoidal reference peak $M$. Express your final answer symbolically in terms of $M$ only; do not attach units.",
            "solution": "The core principle of Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM) is the comparison of a high-frequency triangular carrier waveform, $v_c(t)$, with a low-frequency sinusoidal reference waveform, $v_r(t)$. Overmodulation is a condition where the modulation process saturates, which occurs when the pulse width for a given carrier cycle becomes either always zero or the full duration of the carrier period. This saturation happens if, during a carrier cycle, the reference signal is always below or always above the carrier signal, respectively.\n\nThe problem states that the carrier voltage $v_c(t)$ is a symmetric triangular wave centered at zero, swinging between $-V_c$ and $+V_c$. Therefore, for any time $t$, the instantaneous value of the carrier voltage is bounded by its peak amplitude $V_c$:\n$$ -V_c \\le v_c(t) \\le V_c $$\nor, more compactly, $|v_c(t)| \\le V_c$.\n\nTo avoid saturation of the comparator output, the reference voltage must intersect the carrier voltage waveform within each carrier period. If the instantaneous value of the reference voltage, $v_r(t)$, were to exceed the peak value of the carrier, $V_c$, then at that moment, $v_r(t)$ would be greater than any possible value of $v_c(t)$. This would cause the comparator output to lock in a high state, saturating the pulse width to its maximum. Similarly, if $v_r(t)$ were to fall below the minimum value of the carrier, $-V_c$, the comparator output would lock in a low state, saturating the pulse width to zero.\n\nThe condition to avoid overmodulation at any point in time is therefore that the instantaneous value of the reference signal must remain within the bounds of the carrier signal's peak amplitudes. This can be expressed as:\n$$ -V_c \\le v_r(t) \\le V_c \\quad \\forall t $$\nThis is equivalent to the condition:\n$$ |v_r(t)| \\le V_c \\quad \\forall t $$\nSince this must hold for all time $t$, it must hold for the time at which $|v_r(t)|$ is maximum. The reference voltage is given as $v_r(t) = M \\sin(\\omega_m t)$. The maximum absolute value of this sinusoidal function is its peak amplitude, $M$.\n$$ \\max_t |v_r(t)| = \\max_t |M \\sin(\\omega_m t)| = M $$\nSubstituting this into the no-overmodulation inequality, we obtain the fundamental condition:\n$$ M \\le V_c $$\n\nThis derivation is based on the general principle of comparing a reference to a carrier. We now apply this to the specific cases of bipolar and unipolar SPWM.\n\nFor bipolar SPWM, a single sinusoidal reference $v_r(t) = M \\sin(\\omega_m t)$ is compared against the carrier $v_c(t)$. The reference waveform is used directly. As derived above, the amplitude $M$ of this reference must be less than or equal to the carrier amplitude $V_c$ to prevent overmodulation. Thus, the condition is $M \\le V_c$.\n\nFor unipolar SPWM, two reference signals are used to modulate the two legs of the full-bridge inverter independently. Let's call them leg A and leg B.\nLeg A is modulated using the reference $+v_r(t) = M \\sin(\\omega_m t)$.\nLeg B is modulated using the reference $-v_r(t) = -M \\sin(\\omega_m t)$.\nBoth are compared against the same carrier $v_c(t)$.\n\nFor leg A to operate without overmodulation, its reference signal's amplitude must be bounded by the carrier's amplitude. The amplitude of $+v_r(t)$ is $M$. This leads to the condition $M \\le V_c$.\n\nFor leg B to operate without overmodulation, its reference signal's amplitude must also be bounded by the carrier's amplitude. The reference is $-v_r(t)$, which has an amplitude of $|-M| = M$. This again leads to the condition $M \\le V_c$.\n\nFor the entire unipolar inverter to operate without overmodulation, neither leg can be in a state of overmodulation. Since both legs impose the identical requirement, the condition to avoid overmodulation in unipolar SPWM is also $M \\le V_c$.\n\nTherefore, for a sinusoidal reference of peak amplitude $M$ and a triangular carrier of peak amplitude $V_c$, the condition to avoid overmodulation is $M \\le V_c$ for both bipolar and unipolar SPWM strategies.\n\nNext, we relate this condition to the amplitude modulation index, $m_a$, which is defined as $m_a \\triangleq M/V_c$.\nThe no-overmodulation condition is:\n$$ M \\le V_c $$\nAssuming $V_c > 0$, which must be true for a physical carrier signal, we can divide both sides of the inequality by $V_c$ without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$ \\frac{M}{V_c} \\le 1 $$\nBy the definition of $m_a$, this is equivalent to:\n$$ m_a \\le 1 $$\nThis establishes that linear modulation (no overmodulation) is maintained as long as the amplitude modulation index is less than or equal to unity.\n\nFinally, we determine the minimum carrier peak amplitude, $V_{c,\\min}$, required to avoid overmodulation for a given sinusoidal reference peak amplitude $M$. The condition is $M \\le V_c$, which can be rewritten as:\n$$ V_c \\ge M $$\nThis inequality specifies that the carrier peak amplitude $V_c$ must be greater than or equal to the reference peak amplitude $M$. To satisfy this requirement, the minimum possible value that $V_c$ can take is exactly $M$. Any value of $V_c$ less than $M$ would violate the condition and lead to overmodulation.\nTherefore, the minimum required carrier peak amplitude is:\n$$ V_{c,\\min} = M $$",
