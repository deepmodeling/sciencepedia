The premises are scientifically sound and represent a standard model for dead-time effects in power electronics. The problem is well-posed, objective, self-contained, and requires a rigorous derivation based on fundamental principles of power electronics and control. All necessary parameters are provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThe derivation of the compensation method for dead-time effects in a Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) leg proceeds from an analysis of the ideal case, followed by an analysis of the voltage error introduced by the dead time, and finally the formulation of a corrective action.\n\n**1. Ideal Dead-Time-Free SPWM**\n\nIn a VSI leg, the pole voltage, $v_{pole}$, is switched between the positive DC rail, $+V_{dc}/2$, and the negative DC rail, $-V_{dc}/2$. The average value of the pole voltage over one switching period, $\\langle v_{pole} \\rangle_{T_s}$, is controlled to follow a sinusoidal reference.\n\nThe reference signal is given by $v_{ref}(\\theta) = m \\sin(\\theta)$, where $m$ is the modulation index and $\\theta$ is the electrical angle. The carrier is a symmetric triangular wave oscillating between $-1$ and $1$. For Sinusoidal PWM (SPWM), the duty cycle, $d$, which represents the fraction of the switching period $T_s$ for which the top switch is commanded ON, is determined by the reference signal. With this carrier definition, the instantaneous ideal duty cycle command, $d_{ideal}$, is given by:\n$$\nd_{ideal}(\\theta) = \\frac{1 + v_{ref}(\\theta)}{2} = \\frac{1 + m \\sin(\\theta)}{2}\n$$\nThe average pole voltage in the ideal case is the weighted average of the two voltage levels:\n$$\n\\langle v_{pole, ideal} \\rangle_{T_s} = d_{ideal} \\left(+\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}\\right) + (1 - d_{ideal}) \\left(-\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}\\right)\n$$\nSimplifying this expression gives:\n$$\n\\langle v_{pole, ideal} \\rangle_{T_s} = \\frac{V_{dc}}{2} (2d_{ideal} - 1)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $d_{ideal}(\\theta)$:\n$$\n\\langle v_{pole, ideal} \\rangle_{T_s} = \\frac{V_{dc}}{2} \\left(2\\left(\\frac{1 + m \\sin(\\theta)}{2}\\right) - 1\\right) = \\frac{V_{dc}}{2} (1 + m \\sin(\\theta) - 1) = \\frac{V_{dc}}{2} m \\sin(\\theta)\n$$\nThis is the target average voltage that the inverter should produce.\n\n**2. Voltage Error due to Dead Time**\n\nDead time, $t_d$, is a necessary blanking period during which both switches in the leg are commanded OFF to prevent a short-circuit (shoot-through) of the DC link. During this interval, the path for the load current is provided by the antiparallel diodes, and the pole voltage is clamped to one of the DC rails. The clamping voltage depends on the direction of the load current, $i_{load}$. The problem specifies two cases:\n\nCase A: Positive load current ($i_{load}  0$)\nThe current flows out of the phase leg. During the dead time, the current freewheels through the bottom diode, clamping the pole voltage to the negative rail, $v_{pole} = -V_{dc}/2$.\n\nCase B: Negative load current ($i_{load}  0$)\nThe current flows into the phase leg. During the dead time, the current freewheels through the top diode, clamping the pole voltage to the positive rail, $v_{pole} = +V_{dc}/2$.\n\nWith a symmetric triangular carrier, there is one turn-on transition for the top switch and one turn-on transition for the bottom switch within each switching period $T_s$. A dead-time interval of duration $t_d$ precedes each turn-on.\n\nLet's analyze the voltage error in each case. The error occurs when the actual voltage during the dead time differs from the voltage that would have been present in an ideal, instantaneous transition.\n\nAnalysis for $i_{load}  0$:\nThe pole voltage is clamped to $-V_{dc}/2$ during $t_d$. Let's consider the transition from the bottom switch being ON to the top switch being ON. Ideally, the voltage would switch from $-V_{dc}/2$ to $+V_{dc}/2$. However, due to the dead time, the turn-on of the top switch is delayed by $t_d$. During this $t_d$ interval, the pole is clamped to $-V_{dc}/2$, whereas the commanded voltage has just switched to $+V_{dc}/2$. This creates a voltage error. The magnitude of this instantaneous voltage error is $V_{error} = V_{actual} - V_{ideal} = (-V_{dc}/2) - (+V_{dc}/2) = -V_{dc}$. This error persists for the duration $t_d$ at every turn-on of the top switch.\nAt the other transition (top switch turning OFF, bottom switch turning ON), the pole voltage is ideally going from $+V_{dc}/2$ to $-V_{dc}/2$. During the dead time, the pole is clamped to $-V_{dc}/2$, which is the intended final voltage. Therefore, no voltage error occurs at this transition.\nThe total volt-second error per switching period is $V_{err} \\cdot t_d = -V_{dc} t_d$. The average voltage error is this value divided by $T_s$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\langle v_{pole} \\rangle_{T_s} = \\frac{-V_{dc} t_d}{T_s} = -V_{dc} f_s t_d\n$$\n\nAnalysis for $i_{load}  0$:\nThe pole voltage is clamped to $+V_{dc}/2$ during $t_d$. The error now occurs at the turn-on of the bottom switch. Ideally, the voltage should switch from $+V_{dc}/2$ to $-V_{dc}/2$. During the dead-time interval $t_d$ preceding the bottom switch turn-on, the pole is clamped to $+V_{dc}/2$. The instantaneous voltage error is $V_{error} = V_{actual} - V_{ideal} = (+V_{dc}/2) - (-V_{dc}/2) = +V_{dc}$. This error persists for $t_d$. At the other transition (bottom switch OFF, top switch ON), no error occurs as the clamped voltage $+V_{dc}/2$ matches the intended final state.\nThe total volt-second error per switching period is $V_{err} \\cdot t_d = +V_{dc} t_d$. The average voltage error is:\n$$\n\\Delta \\langle v_{pole} \\rangle_{T_s} = \\frac{+V_{dc} t_d}{T_s} = +V_{dc} f_s t_d\n$$\nIn summary, the actual average pole voltage $\\langle v_{pole, actual} \\rangle$ is related to the ideal average voltage by:\n$$\n\\langle v_{pole, actual} \\rangle = \\langle v_{pole, ideal} \\rangle + \\Delta \\langle v_{pole} \\rangle = \\frac{V_{dc}}{2} m \\sin(\\theta) - \\text{sign}(i_{load}) V_{dc} f_s t_d\n$$\n\n**3. Derivation of the Compensated Duty Command**\n\nThe goal of compensation is to find a modified duty command, $d_{comp}$, such that when it is used, the actual average pole voltage equals the desired ideal voltage. The actual voltage produced by a given command $d_{comp}$ is found by relating the command to the average voltage, including the error term. The average voltage produced by a command $d_{comp}$ under dead-time effect is:\n$$\n\\langle v_{pole, actual} \\rangle (d_{comp}) = \\frac{V_{dc}}{2} (2d_{comp} - 1) - \\text{sign}(i_{load}) V_{dc} f_s t_d\n$$\nWe want this to be equal to the target ideal voltage:\n$$\n\\langle v_{pole, ideal} \\rangle = \\frac{V_{dc}}{2} (2d_{ideal} - 1)\n$$\nEquating the expressions:\n$$\n\\frac{V_{dc}}{2} (2d_{comp} - 1) - \\text{sign}(i_{load}) V_{dc} f_s t_d = \\frac{V_{dc}}{2} (2d_{ideal} - 1)\n$$\nDividing by $V_{dc}$ (note that $V_{dc}$ is not relevant for the duty cycle correction itself):\n$$\nd_{comp} - \\frac{1}{2} - \\text{sign}(i_{load}) f_s t_d = d_{ideal} - \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nSolving for $d_{comp}$:\n$$\nd_{comp} = d_{ideal} + \\text{sign}(i_{load}) f_s t_d\n$$\nThis general formula gives us the two specific compensated duty commands based on current polarity:\n\nFor $i_{load}  0$ ($\\text{sign}(i_{load}) = 1$):\n$$\nd_{comp}^+(\\theta) = d_{ideal}(\\theta) + f_s t_d\n$$\nFor $i_{load}  0$ ($\\text{sign}(i_{load}) = -1$):\n$$\nd_{comp}^-(\\theta) = d_{ideal}(\\theta) - f_s t_d\n$$\nSubstituting $d_{ideal}(\\theta) = \\frac{1 + m \\sin(\\theta)}{2}$:\n$$\nd_{comp}^+(\\theta) = \\frac{1 + m \\sin(\\theta)}{2} + f_s t_d\n$$\n$$\nd_{comp}^-(\\theta) = \\frac{1 + m \\sin(\\theta)}{2} - f_s t_d\n$$\n\n**4. Final Expressions with Numerical Values**\n\nThe problem provides the following parameters: $m = 0.8$, $f_s = 20 \\text{ kHz} = 2 \\times 10^4 \\text{ Hz}$, and $t_d = 500 \\text{ ns} = 5 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ s}$. The DC link voltage $V_{dc}=600 \\text{ V}$ is necessary for the conceptual derivation of voltage error but does not appear in the final duty cycle correction formula.\n\nFirst, we calculate the duty cycle correction term, $\\Delta d = f_s t_d$:\n$$\n\\Delta d = f_s t_d = (2 \\times 10^4 \\text{ s}^{-1}) \\times (5 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ s}) = 10 \\times 10^{-3} = 0.01\n$$\nNow we substitute the values of $m$ and $\\Delta d$ into the expressions for the compensated duty commands.\n\nFor positive current ($i_{load}  0$):\n$$\nd_{comp}^+(\\theta) = \\frac{1 + 0.8 \\sin(\\theta)}{2} + 0.01 = 0.5 + 0.4 \\sin(\\theta) + 0.01 = 0.51 + 0.4 \\sin(\\theta)\n$$\n\nFor negative current ($i_{load}  0$):\n$$\nd_{comp}^-(\\theta) = \\frac{1 + 0.8 \\sin(\\theta)}{2} - 0.01 = 0.5 + 0.4 \\sin(\\theta) - 0.01 = 0.49 + 0.4 \\sin(\\theta)\n$$\n\nThese are the final closed-form analytic functions for the compensated duty commands, expressed as functions of the electrical angle $\\theta$.",

            "problem": "A voltage source inverter leg is built from a complementary half-bridge using Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) devices with body diodes and ideal drivers that enforce a non-overlap dead time. Let the direct-current bus voltage be $V_\\text{dc}$, the Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) switching period be $T_s$, and the commanded top-device duty ratio within each period be $d \\in [0,1]$. A fixed dead time of $t_d$ is inserted at every transition to prevent cross-conduction, during which both transistors are off and the leg voltage is determined by diode conduction according to the instantaneous phase current polarity. Assume the phase current $i$ is approximately constant over any single switching period (due to the load inductance), the devices are ideal (zero voltage drop when on; diodes are ideal), and carrier-based sinusoidal PWM is used so that the commanded duty evolves as $d(t) = \\big(1 + m \\sin(\\omega t)\\big)/2$ with modulation index $m \\in (0,1)$.\n\nFrom the principles of PWM averaging and conduction path determination by current polarity, small commanded pulses near $d \\approx 0$ or $d \\approx 1$ can be truncated or eliminated by the dead-time intervals. Independently, the dead time introduces a nearly fixed absolute time offset per switching period that maps to an average voltage error whose fractional significance depends on the commanded fundamental amplitude.\n\nSelect all statements that correctly describe how dead time interacts with PWM duty cycles near $0$ and $1$, and why its fractional impact increases at low modulation indices.\n\nA. Under positive leg current $i0$, the leg clamps to the low level during dead time via the bottom diode, which subtracts a fixed time $t_d$ from the effective high-level conduction in each period; under negative leg current $i0$, the leg clamps to the high level via the top diode, adding a fixed time $t_d$ to the effective high-level conduction. Thus $d_\\text{eff} = \\max\\!\\big(0,\\, d - t_d/T_s\\big)$ for $i0$ and $d_\\text{eff} = \\min\\!\\big(1,\\, d + t_d/T_s\\big)$ for $i0$, so commanded pulses near $d=0$ or $d=1$ are truncated and can vanish when $d  t_d/T_s$ or $1-d  t_d/T_s$.\n\nB.

In sinusoidal PWM, the dead-time-induced average voltage error per switching period has magnitude set primarily by $t_d/T_s$ and $V_\\text{dc}$, which is approximately independent of the modulation index $m$. Because the commanded fundamental amplitude is proportional to $m$, the ratio of error to commanded amplitude increases as $m$ decreases.\n\nD. The dead time mainly affects transitions near the carrier extrema where $d$ approaches $0$ or $1$. At low modulation indices $m \\to 0$, the duty spends most of the time near these extrema, so the fractional impact grows because extreme duty conditions are more frequent.\n\nE. Dead time introduces only a zero-sequence voltage that cancels in line-to-line quantities, so its fractional impact on the torque-producing fundamental component is negligible for any $m$.\n\nChoose one or more options.",

It is a standard, well-posed problem in the field of power electronics.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. I will proceed with deriving the solution and evaluating the options.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis of dead-time effects in a voltage source inverter leg is fundamental. Let the top transistor be $S_1$ and the bottom transistor be $S_2$. The output voltage of the leg, $V_{out}$, is $V_\\text{dc}$ when $S_1$ conducts and $0$ when $S_2$ conducts (assuming the negative DC rail is the reference).\n\n**1. Ideal Operation (No Dead Time)**\nIn ideal PWM, the average output voltage over one switching period $T_s$ is directly proportional to the commanded duty cycle $d$:\n$$V_{avg, ideal} = d \\cdot V_\\text{dc}$$\n\n**2. Operation with Dead Time ($t_d$)**\nDuring the dead time $t_d$, both $S_1$ and $S_2$ are commanded to be off. The path for the load current $i$ is provided by the freewheeling body diodes. The output voltage during this interval is determined by which diode conducts.\n\n*   **Case 1: Positive Current ($i  0$)**\n    The current is flowing out of the inverter leg. To maintain this flow when both switches are off, the current must find a path to the negative DC rail. This path is through the body diode of the bottom transistor, $S_2$. Conduction of the bottom diode clamps the output voltage $V_{out}$ to $0$.\n\n*   **Case 2: Negative Current ($i  0$)**\n    The current is flowing into the inverter leg. The path for this current is from the positive DC rail through the body diode of the top transistor, $S_1$. Conduction of the top diode clamps the output voltage $V_{out}$ to $V_\\text{dc}$.\n\n**3. Impact on Effective Duty Cycle**\nA dead time $t_d$ is inserted at each transition (from $S_1$ to $S_2$ and from $S_2$ to $S_1$). Let's analyze the effect on the total time the output is high ($V_{out} = V_\\text{dc}$) within a period $T_s$.\n\n*   **For $i  0$:** The output is forced to $0$ during the dead time. This occurs regardless of whether the high-side or low-side switch was supposed to be conducting. The dead time effectively eats into the on-time of the top switch $S_1$. For each switching cycle, there is a low-to-high and a high-to-low transition. The dead time causes a loss of high-voltage time. A standard analysis shows the total on-time is reduced by $t_d$. The actual high-voltage duration becomes $d T_s - t_d$. The effective duty cycle $d_\\text{eff}$ is:\n    $$d_\\text{eff} = \\frac{d T_s - t_d}{T_s} = d - \\frac{t_d}{T_s}$$\n    This results in an average voltage error of $\\Delta V_{avg} = (d_\\text{eff} - d)V_\\text{dc} = -\\frac{t_d}{T_s} V_\\text{dc}$. The output voltage is lower than commanded.\n\n*   **For $i  0$:** The output is forced to $V_\\text{dc}$ during the dead time. This effectively extends the on-time of the top switch $S_1$. The actual high-voltage duration becomes $d T_s + t_d$. The effective duty cycle $d_\\text{eff}$ is:\n    $$d_\\text{eff} = \\frac{d T_s + t_d}{T_s} = d + \\frac{t_d}{T_s}$$\n    This results in an average voltage error of $\\Delta V_{avg} = (d_\\text{eff} - d)V_\\text{dc} = +\\frac{t_d}{T_s} V_\\text{dc}$. The output voltage is higher than commanded.\n\n**4. Pulse Truncation/Dropping**\nThe effective duty cycle must remain in the range $[0, 1]$.\n*   For $i  0$, if the commanded duty is very small, such that $d  t_d/T_s$, the effective duty cycle would become negative. Physically, this means the turn-on pulse is shorter than the dead time, so the top switch never effectively turns on. The output remains low for the entire period. Thus, $d_\\text{eff}$ is more accurately described as $d_\\text{eff} = \\max\\left(0, d - t_d/T_s\\right)$.\n*   For $i  0$, if the commanded duty is close to unity, such that $d + t_d/T_s  1$, the effective duty cycle cannot exceed $1$. This occurs when the commanded off-time for the top switch, $(1-d)T_s$, is less than $t_d$. The output remains high for the entire period. Thus, $d_\\text{eff} = \\min\\left(1, d + t_d/T_s\\right)$.\n\n**5. Impact at Low Modulation Index ($m$)**\nThe magnitude of the voltage error per switching cycle is $|\\Delta V_{avg}| = \\frac{t_d}{T_s} V_\\text{dc}$. This value is determined by fixed parameters ($t_d$, $T_s$, $V_\\text{dc}$) and is therefore approximately constant, independent of the modulation index $m$.\n\nThe commanded fundamental component of the inverter's output voltage has an amplitude that is proportional to the modulation index, $m$. For SPWM, the peak fundamental line-to-neutral voltage is $V_{1, \\text{peak}} = m \\frac{V_\\text{dc}}{2}$.\n\nThe fractional significance (or relative error) is the ratio of the error voltage magnitude to the commanded signal magnitude. Averaged over a fundamental cycle, the dead-time effect introduces an error voltage whose fundamental component has a magnitude that is roughly constant, let's call it $V_{\\text{err},1}$. The commanded fundamental is $V_{1, \\text{peak}} \\propto m$.\nThe fractional impact is therefore:\n$$\\text{Fractional Impact} \\propto \\frac{V_{\\text{err},1}}{V_{1, \\text{peak}}} \\propto \\frac{1}{m}$$\nAs the modulation index $m$ decreases (e.g., for low-speed operation of a motor), the commanded voltage becomes very small, but the absolute error voltage from dead time remains the same. Consequently, the relative distortion becomes very large.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Under positive leg current $i0$, the leg clamps to the low level during dead time via the bottom diode, which subtracts a fixed time $t_d$ from the effective high-level conduction in each period; under negative leg current $i0$, the leg clamps to the high level via the top diode, adding a fixed time $t_d$ to the effective high-level conduction. Thus $d_\\text{eff} = \\max\\!\\big(0,\\, d - t_d/T_s\\big)$ for $i0$ and $d_\\text{eff} = \\min\\!\\big(1,\\, d + t_d/T_s\\big)$ for $i0$, so commanded pulses near $d=0$ or $d=1$ are truncated and can vanish when $d  t_d/T_s$ or $1-d  t_d/T_s$.**\n\nThis statement is a comprehensive and accurate description of the dead-time effect. It correctly identifies the physical mechanism (clamping via diodes based on current direction), the mathematical result for the effective duty cycle (subtractive for $i0$, additive for $i0$), and the consequence of pulse truncation/elimination near the boundaries of the duty cycle range using the $\\max()$ and $\\min()$ functions. The conditions for vanishing pulses, $d  t_d/T_s$ and $1-d  t_d/T_s$, are also correctly stated. This statement aligns perfectly with the derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Dead time scales the effective duty multiplicatively and independently of current polarity, so $d_\\text{eff} = d \\big(1 - t_d/T_s\\big)$ for all $d \\in [0,1]$, making the relative error constant across duty cycle and modulation index.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect on multiple counts. First, the effect of dead time is an additive/subtractive time offset, not a multiplicative scaling of the duty cycle. Second, the effect is critically dependent on the current polarity, which this statement incorrectly claims it is independent of. The proposed equation would imply an error proportional to $d$, which contradicts the established model of a fixed volt-second error.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. In sinusoidal PWM, the dead-time-induced average voltage error per switching period has magnitude set primarily by $t_d/T_s$ and $V_\\text{dc}$, which is approximately independent of the modulation index $m$. Because the commanded fundamental amplitude is proportional to $m$, the ratio of error to commanded amplitude increases as $m$ decreases.**\n\nThis statement correctly analyzes the relative impact of dead time. The magnitude of the voltage error per cycle, $|\\Delta V_{avg}| = (t_d/T_s)V_\\text{dc}$, is indeed independent of $m$. The commanded fundamental voltage amplitude is proportional to $m$. The ratio of a constant error to a signal proportional to $m$ is proportional to $1/m$. Therefore, the fractional impact of the error grows as $m$ decreases. This is a critical issue in high-performance drives at low speeds.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. The dead time mainly affects transitions near the carrier extrema where $d$ approaches $0$ or $1$. At low modulation indices $m \\to 0$, the duty spends most of the time near these extrema, so the fractional impact grows because extreme duty conditions are more frequent.**\n\nThis statement contains flawed reasoning. The first premise is misleading; the voltage error $\\pm (t_d/T_s)V_\\text{dc}$ occurs at every switching event, not just near $d=0$ or $d=1$. The second premise is factually wrong: for a low modulation index $m \\to 0$, the duty cycle $d(t) = (1 + m \\sin(\\omega t))/2$ hovers very close to $0.5$, not near the extrema $0$ and $1$. The duty cycle only approaches the extrema for high modulation indices ($m \\approx 1$). The conclusion is based on incorrect premises.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Dead time introduces only a zero-sequence voltage that cancels in line-to-line quantities, so its fractional impact on the torque-producing fundamental component is negligible for any $m$.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The voltage error in each phase depends on the sign of that phase's current ($\\Delta V_k = \\text{sgn}(i_k) (t_d/T_s) V_\\text{dc}$ for phase $k \\in \\{a, b, c\\}$). Since in a balanced three-phase system the currents sum to zero ($i_a+i_b+i_c=0$) but are phase-shifted, their signs are not always the same. Therefore, the phase voltage errors do not form a pure zero-sequence system. The errors do not cancel in the line-to-line voltages (e.g., $\\Delta V_{ab} = \\Delta V_a - \\Delta V_b \\neq 0$ in general), meaning the dead time distorts the differential-mode, torque-producing voltage components. Furthermore, as established in option C, the impact is far from negligible, especially for small $m$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",

            "problem": "Consider one phase leg of a two-level Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) using Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs) with anti-parallel diodes, supplied by a direct-current bus of voltage $V_{\\mathrm{dc}}$. The leg is modulated by center-aligned Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) at switching frequency $f_{s}$ with period $T_{s} = 1/f_{s}$. A symmetric non-overlap interval (dead-time) of duration $t_{d}$ is inserted at each complementary commutation to avoid cross-conduction. Due to gate driver mismatch, the turn-on command skew introduces an additional delay $\\delta$ on the commutation that enables the device intended to conduct, effectively modifying the relevant non-overlap interval by $\\delta$ for that commutation, while the complementary commutation’s non-overlap is reduced by $\\delta$.\n\nAssume the following operating conditions:\n- $V_{\\mathrm{dc}} = 600\\ \\text{V}$,\n- $f_{s} = 50\\ \\text{kHz}$ (so $T_{s} = 20\\ \\mu\\text{s}$),\n- nominal dead-time $t_{d} = 200\\ \\text{ns}$,\n- skew $\\delta = 50\\ \\text{ns}$,\n- the phase current $i$ is approximately constant over $T_{s}$ and is positive, $i = +10\\ \\text{A}$, so that during any non-overlap interval the phase node is clamped by a forward-biased diode to the upper rail at $+V_{\\mathrm{dc}}$.\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions and first principles of switching and averaging, derive the average phase-node voltage error over one switching period $T_{s}$ caused by:\n1) the nominal dead-time $t_{d}$, and\n2) the additional skew $\\delta$ on the relevant commutation for the given current direction.\n\nThen, compute the ratio\n$$R = \\frac{|\\Delta v_{\\delta}|}{|\\Delta v_{t_{d}}|},$$\nwhere $|\\Delta v_{t_{d}}|$ is the magnitude of the average voltage error due to the nominal dead-time and $|\\Delta v_{\\delta}|$ is the magnitude of the incremental average voltage error due to the skew.\n\nExpress $R$ as a dimensionless decimal number, rounded to four significant figures.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis begins by establishing the mechanism of voltage error due to dead-time in a VSI leg. The error arises because, during the dead-time interval when both switches ($S_U$ and $S_L$) are off, the phase-node voltage is determined not by the gating commands but by the direction of the load current.\n\nThe problem states that the phase current $i$ is positive and results in the phase node being clamped to the upper DC rail, at potential $V_{\\mathrm{dc}}$, during the dead-time. This occurs because the current, seeking a path, flows through the anti-parallel diode of the upper switch, $D_U$.\n\nLet the ideal output voltage be $v_{\\mathrm{ideal}}(t)$, which is either $0$ or $V_{\\mathrm{dc}}$, as dictated by the PWM duty cycle. The actual voltage, $v_{\\mathrm{actual}}(t)$, deviates from this ideal during dead-time. Let us analyze the two switching transitions within one period $T_s$.\n\n1.  **Rising-Edge Transition ($S_L \\rightarrow S_U$):**\n    The ideal command intends to switch the output from $0$ (with $S_L$ on) to $V_{\\mathrm{dc}}$ (with $S_U$ on). Let this transition be timed at $t_1$. To implement this with dead-time, the command to turn $S_L$ off is issued at $t_1$. The command to turn $S_U$ on is issued after the dead-time interval. As soon as $S_L$ turns off at $t_1$, the phase node is floating. The positive current $i$ immediately finds its path through the upper-side diode $D_U$, clamping the voltage $v_{\\mathrm{actual}}$ to $V_{\\mathrm{dc}}$. Thus, the actual voltage rises to $V_{\\mathrm{dc}}$ at time $t_1$, which is exactly when the ideal voltage was supposed to rise. Consequently, there is no voltage error introduced during the rising-edge transition, regardless of the dead-time duration.\n\n2.  **Falling-Edge Transition ($S_U \\rightarrow S_L$):**\n    The ideal command intends to switch the output from $V_{\\mathrm{dc}}$ (with $S_U$ on) to $0$ (with $S_L$ on). Let this transition be timed at $t_2$. To implement this, the command to turn $S_U$ off is issued at $t_2$. Let the duration of the dead-time for this transition be $t_{d, \\text{fall}}$. The command to turn $S_L$ on is issued at $t_2 + t_{d, \\text{fall}}$. In the interval $[t_2, t_2 + t_{d, \\text{fall}}]$, both switches are off. The positive current $i$ continues to force the voltage to be clamped to $V_{\\mathrm{dc}}$ via diode $D_U$. The voltage $v_{\\mathrm{actual}}$ only drops to $0$ when $S_L$ is turned on at $t_2 + t_{d, \\text{fall}}$. Therefore, the falling edge of the voltage pulse is delayed by a duration equal to $t_{d, \\text{fall}}$.\n    This delay results in a voltage error. For a duration of $t_{d, \\text{fall}}$, the actual voltage is $V_{\\mathrm{dc}}$ while the ideal voltage is $0$. The voltage-time error area per switching cycle is $A_{\\mathrm{err}} = (V_{\\mathrm{actual}} - V_{\\mathrm{ideal}}) \\times \\text{duration} = (V_{\\mathrm{dc}} - 0) \\times t_{d, \\text{fall}} = V_{\\mathrm{dc}} \\cdot t_{d, \\text{fall}}$.\n    The average voltage error over a period $T_s$ is $\\Delta v = \\frac{A_{\\mathrm{err}}}{T_s} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}} \\cdot t_{d, \\text{fall}}}{T_s}$.\n\nFrom this, we see that the total voltage error is determined solely by the dead-time duration on the falling-edge transition, $t_{d, \\text{fall}}$.\n\n**1. Average Voltage Error due to Nominal Dead-Time, $\\Delta v_{t_d}$**\nIn the nominal case, the dead-time is symmetric, so $t_{d, \\text{fall}} = t_d$. The resulting average voltage error is:\n$$ \\Delta v_{t_d} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}} \\cdot t_d}{T_s} $$\nThe magnitude is $|\\Delta v_{t_d}| = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}} \\cdot t_d}{T_s}$, as all quantities are positive.\n\n**2. Incremental Average Voltage Error due to Skew, $\\Delta v_{\\delta}$**\nThe problem describes an asymmetry caused by skew $\\delta$. The non-overlap intervals for the two commutations in a cycle are $t_d+\\delta$ and $t_d-\\delta$. We must determine which of these corresponds to the falling edge.\nThe problem states that the commutation with the longer dead-time ($t_d+\\delta$) is \"the commutation that enables the device intended to conduct\". For a positive current $i$ (which freewheels through $D_U$), the \"device intended to conduct\" is the upper switch $S_U$, as it takes over conduction from its own anti-parallel diode $D_U$ (a natural or zero-voltage-switching turn-on). The commutation that \"enables\" $S_U$ is the rising-edge transition ($S_L \\rightarrow S_U$).\nTherefore, the dead-time for the rising edge is $t_{d, \\text{rise}} = t_d + \\delta$.\nThe dead-time for the complementary commutation, the falling edge, is $t_{d, \\text{fall}} = t_d - \\delta$.\n\nThe total average voltage error in the presence of skew, $\\Delta v_{\\text{total}}$, is determined by $t_{d, \\text{fall}}$:\n$$ \\Delta v_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}} \\cdot t_{d, \\text{fall}}}{T_s} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}} (t_d - \\delta)}{T_s} $$\nThe incremental error due to skew, $\\Delta v_{\\delta}$, is the change from the nominal case:\n$$ \\Delta v_{\\delta} = \\Delta v_{\\text{total}} - \\Delta v_{t_d} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}} (t_d - \\delta)}{T_s} - \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}} \\cdot t_d}{T_s} $$\n$$ \\Delta v_{\\delta} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}} \\cdot t_d - V_{\\mathrm{dc}} \\cdot \\delta - V_{\\mathrm{dc}} \\cdot t_d}{T_s} = -\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}} \\cdot \\delta}{T_s} $$\nThe magnitude is $|\\Delta v_{\\delta}| = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}} \\cdot \\delta}{T_s}$.\n\n**3. Ratio Calculation**\nThe ratio $R$ is now computed:\n$$ R = \\frac{|\\Delta v_{\\delta}|}{|\\Delta v_{t_{d}}|} = \\frac{\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}} \\cdot \\delta}{T_s}}{\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}} \\cdot t_d}{T_s}} = \\frac{\\delta}{t_d} $$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n- Nominal dead-time $t_d = 200\\ \\text{ns}$\n- Skew $\\delta = 50\\ \\text{ns}$\n$$ R = \\frac{50\\ \\text{ns}}{200\\ \\text{ns}} = \\frac{50}{200} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be a decimal rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ R = 0.2500 $$\nThe calculation is independent of $V_{\\mathrm{dc}}$, $f_s$, and $i$, which merely set the physical context in which the timing errors manifest as voltage errors.",
