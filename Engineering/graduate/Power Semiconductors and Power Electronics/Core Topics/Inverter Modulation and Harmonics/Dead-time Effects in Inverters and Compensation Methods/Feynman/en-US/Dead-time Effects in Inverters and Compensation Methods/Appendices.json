The premises are scientifically sound and represent a standard model for dead-time effects in power electronics. The problem is well-posed, objective, self-contained, and requires a rigorous derivation based on fundamental principles of power electronics and control. All necessary parameters are provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities.\n\nThe derivation of the compensation method for dead-time effects in a Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) leg proceeds from an analysis of the ideal case, followed by an analysis of the voltage error introduced by the dead time, and finally the formulation of a corrective action.\n\n**1. Ideal Dead-Time-Free SPWM**\n\nIn a VSI leg, the pole voltage, $v_{pole}$, is switched between the positive DC rail, $+V_{dc}/2$, and the negative DC rail, $-V_{dc}/2$. The average value of the pole voltage over one switching period, $\\langle v_{pole} \\rangle_{T_s}$, is controlled to follow a sinusoidal reference.\n\nThe reference signal is given by $v_{ref}(\\theta) = m \\sin(\\theta)$, where $m$ is the modulation index and $\\theta$ is the electrical angle. The carrier is a symmetric triangular wave oscillating between $-1$ and $1$. For Sinusoidal PWM (SPWM), the duty cycle, $d$, which represents the fraction of the switching period $T_s$ for which the top switch is commanded ON, is determined by the reference signal. With this carrier definition, the instantaneous ideal duty cycle command, $d_{ideal}$, is given by:\n$$\nd_{ideal}(\\theta) = \\frac{1 + v_{ref}(\\theta)}{2} = \\frac{1 + m \\sin(\\theta)}{2}\n$$\nThe average pole voltage in the ideal case is the weighted average of the two voltage levels:\n$$\n\\langle v_{pole, ideal} \\rangle_{T_s} = d_{ideal} \\left(+\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}\\right) + (1 - d_{ideal}) \\left(-\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}\\right)\n$$\nSimplifying this expression gives:\n$$\n\\langle v_{pole, ideal} \\rangle_{T_s} = \\frac{V_{dc}}{2} (2d_{ideal} - 1)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $d_{ideal}(\\theta)$:\n$$\n\\langle v_{pole, ideal} \\rangle_{T_s} = \\frac{V_{dc}}{2} \\left(2\\left(\\frac{1 + m \\sin(\\theta)}{2}\\right) - 1\\right) = \\frac{V_{dc}}{2} (1 + m \\sin(\\theta) - 1) = \\frac{V_{dc}}{2} m \\sin(\\theta)\n$$\nThis is the target average voltage that the inverter should produce.\n\n**2. Voltage Error due to Dead Time**\n\nDead time, $t_d$, is a necessary blanking period during which both switches in the leg are commanded OFF to prevent a short-circuit (shoot-through) of the DC link. During this interval, the path for the load current is provided by the antiparallel diodes, and the pole voltage is clamped to one of the DC rails. The clamping voltage depends on the direction of the load current, $i_{load}$. The problem specifies two cases:\n\nCase A: Positive load current ($i_{load} > 0$)\nThe current flows out of the phase leg. During the dead time, the current freewheels through the bottom diode, clamping the pole voltage to the negative rail, $v_{pole} = -V_{dc}/2$.\n\nCase B: Negative load current ($i_{load} < 0$)\nThe current flows into the phase leg. During the dead time, the current freewheels through the top diode, clamping the pole voltage to the positive rail, $v_{pole} = +V_{dc}/2$.\n\nWith a symmetric triangular carrier, there is one turn-on transition for the top switch and one turn-on transition for the bottom switch within each switching period $T_s$. A dead-time interval of duration $t_d$ precedes each turn-on.\n\nLet's analyze the voltage error in each case. The error occurs when the actual voltage during the dead time differs from the voltage that would have been present in an ideal, instantaneous transition.\n\nAnalysis for $i_{load} > 0$:\nThe pole voltage is clamped to $-V_{dc}/2$ during $t_d$. Let's consider the transition from the bottom switch being ON to the top switch being ON. Ideally, the voltage would switch from $-V_{dc}/2$ to $+V_{dc}/2$. However, due to the dead time, the turn-on of the top switch is delayed by $t_d$. During this $t_d$ interval, the pole is clamped to $-V_{dc}/2$, whereas the commanded voltage has just switched to $+V_{dc}/2$. This creates a voltage error. The magnitude of this instantaneous voltage error is $V_{error} = V_{actual} - V_{ideal} = (-V_{dc}/2) - (+V_{dc}/2) = -V_{dc}$. This error persists for the duration $t_d$ at every turn-on of the top switch.\nAt the other transition (top switch turning OFF, bottom switch turning ON), the pole voltage is ideally going from $+V_{dc}/2$ to $-V_{dc}/2$. During the dead time, the pole is clamped to $-V_{dc}/2$, which is the intended final voltage. Therefore, no voltage error occurs at this transition.\nThe total volt-second error per switching period is $V_{err} \\cdot t_d = -V_{dc} t_d$. The average voltage error is this value divided by $T_s$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\langle v_{pole} \\rangle_{T_s} = \\frac{-V_{dc} t_d}{T_s} = -V_{dc} f_s t_d\n$$\n\nAnalysis for $i_{load} < 0$:\nThe pole voltage is clamped to $+V_{dc}/2$ during $t_d$. The error now occurs at the turn-on of the bottom switch. Ideally, the voltage should switch from $+V_{dc}/2$ to $-V_{dc}/2$. During the dead-time interval $t_d$ preceding the bottom switch turn-on, the pole is clamped to $+V_{dc}/2$. The instantaneous voltage error is $V_{error} = V_{actual} - V_{ideal} = (+V_{dc}/2) - (-V_{dc}/2) = +V_{dc}$. This error persists for $t_d$. At the other transition (bottom switch OFF, top switch ON), no error occurs as the clamped voltage $+V_{dc}/2$ matches the intended final state.\nThe total volt-second error per switching period is $V_{err} \\cdot t_d = +V_{dc} t_d$. The average voltage error is:\n$$\n\\Delta \\langle v_{pole} \\rangle_{T_s} = \\frac{+V_{dc} t_d}{T_s} = +V_{dc} f_s t_d\n$$\nIn summary, the actual average pole voltage $\\langle v_{pole, actual} \\rangle$ is related to the ideal average voltage by:\n$$\n\\langle v_{pole, actual} \\rangle = \\langle v_{pole, ideal} \\rangle + \\Delta \\langle v_{pole} \\rangle = \\frac{V_{dc}}{2} m \\sin(\\theta) - \\operatorname{sgn}(i_{load}) V_{dc} f_s t_d\n$$\n\n**3. Derivation of the Compensated Duty Command**\n\nThe goal of compensation is to find a modified duty command, $d_{comp}$, such that when it is used, the actual average pole voltage equals the desired ideal voltage. The actual voltage produced by a given command $d_{comp}$ is found by relating the command to the average voltage, including the error term. The average voltage produced by a command $d_{comp}$ under dead-time effect is:\n$$\n\\langle v_{pole, actual} \\rangle (d_{comp}) = \\frac{V_{dc}}{2} (2d_{comp} - 1) - \\operatorname{sgn}(i_{load}) V_{dc} f_s t_d\n$$\nWe want this to be equal to the target ideal voltage:\n$$\n\\langle v_{pole, ideal} \\rangle = \\frac{V_{dc}}{2} (2d_{ideal} - 1)\n$$\nEquating the expressions:\n$$\n\\frac{V_{dc}}{2} (2d_{comp} - 1) - \\operatorname{sgn}(i_{load}) V_{dc} f_s t_d = \\frac{V_{dc}}{2} (2d_{ideal} - 1)\n$$\nDividing by $V_{dc}$ (note that $V_{dc}$ is not relevant for the duty cycle correction itself):\n$$\nd_{comp} - \\frac{1}{2} - 2\\operatorname{sgn}(i_{load}) f_s t_d = d_{ideal} - \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nSolving for $d_{comp}$:\n$$\nd_{comp} = d_{ideal} + 2\\operatorname{sgn}(i_{load}) f_s t_d\n$$\nThis general formula gives us the two specific compensated duty commands based on current polarity:\n\nFor $i_{load} > 0$ ($\\operatorname{sgn}(i_{load}) = 1$):\n$$\nd_{comp}^+(\\theta) = d_{ideal}(\\theta) + 2 f_s t_d\n$$\nFor $i_{load} < 0$ ($\\operatorname{sgn}(i_{load}) = -1$):\n$$\nd_{comp}^-(\\theta) = d_{ideal}(\\theta) - 2 f_s t_d\n$$\nSubstituting $d_{ideal}(\\theta) = \\frac{1 + m \\sin(\\theta)}{2}$:\n$$\nd_{comp}^+(\\theta) = \\frac{1 + m \\sin(\\theta)}{2} + 2 f_s t_d\n$$\n$$\nd_{comp}^-(\\theta) = \\frac{1 + m \\sin(\\theta)}{2} - 2 f_s t_d\n$$\n\n**4. Final Expressions with Numerical Values**\n\nThe problem provides the following parameters: $m = 0.8$, $f_s = 20 \\text{ kHz} = 2 \\times 10^4 \\text{ Hz}$, and $t_d = 500 \\text{ ns} = 5 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ s}$. The DC link voltage $V_{dc}=600 \\text{ V}$ is necessary for the conceptual derivation of voltage error but does not appear in the final duty cycle correction formula.\n\nFirst, we calculate the duty cycle correction term, $\\Delta d = 2 f_s t_d$:\n$$\n\\Delta d = 2 f_s t_d = 2 \\times (2 \\times 10^4 \\text{ s}^{-1}) \\times (5 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ s}) = 2 \\times (10 \\times 10^{-3}) = 0.02\n$$\nNow we substitute the values of $m$ and $\\Delta d$ into the expressions for the compensated duty commands.\n\nFor positive current ($i_{load} > 0$):\n$$\nd_{comp}^+(\\theta) = \\frac{1 + 0.8 \\sin(\\theta)}{2} + 0.02 = 0.5 + 0.4 \\sin(\\theta) + 0.02 = 0.52 + 0.4 \\sin(\\theta)\n$$\n\nFor negative current ($i_{load} < 0$):\n$$\nd_{comp}^-(\\theta) = \\frac{1 + 0.8 \\sin(\\theta)}{2} - 0.02 = 0.5 + 0.4 \\sin(\\theta) - 0.02 = 0.48 + 0.4 \\sin(\\theta)\n$$\n\nThese are the final closed-form analytic functions for the compensated duty commands, expressed as functions of the electrical angle $\\theta$.",

            "problem": "A voltage source inverter leg is built from a complementary half-bridge using Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) devices with body diodes and ideal drivers that enforce a non-overlap dead time. Let the direct-current bus voltage be $V_\\text{dc}$, the Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) switching period be $T_s$, and the commanded top-device duty ratio within each period be $d \\in [0,1]$. A fixed dead time of $t_d$ is inserted at every transition to prevent cross-conduction, during which both transistors are off and the leg voltage is determined by diode conduction according to the instantaneous phase current polarity. Assume the phase current $i$ is approximately constant over any single switching period (due to the load inductance), the devices are ideal (zero voltage drop when on; diodes are ideal), and carrier-based sinusoidal PWM is used so that the commanded duty evolves as $d(t) = \\big(1 + m \\sin(\\omega t)\\big)/2$ with modulation index $m \\in (0,1)$.\n\nFrom the principles of PWM averaging and conduction path determination by current polarity, small commanded pulses near $d \\approx 0$ or $d \\approx 1$ can be truncated or eliminated by the dead-time intervals. Independently, the dead time introduces a nearly fixed absolute time offset per switching period that maps to an average voltage error whose fractional significance depends on the commanded fundamental amplitude.\n\nSelect all statements that correctly describe how dead time interacts with PWM duty cycles near $0$ and $1$, and why its fractional impact increases at low modulation indices.\n\nA. Under positive leg current $i>0$, the leg clamps to the low level during dead time via the bottom diode, which subtracts a fixed time $t_d$ from the effective high-level conduction in each period; under negative leg current $i<0$, the leg clamps to the high level via the top diode, adding a fixed time $t_d$ to the effective high-level conduction. Thus $d_\\text{eff} = \\max\\!\\big(0,\\, d - t_d/T_s\\big)$ for $i>0$ and $d_\\text{eff} = \\min\\!\\big(1,\\, d + t_d/T_s\\big)$ for $i<0$, so commanded pulses near $d=0$ or $d=1$ are truncated and can vanish when $d < t_d/T_s$ or $1-d < t_d/T_s$.\n\nB.

In sinusoidal PWM, the dead-time-induced average voltage error per switching period has magnitude set primarily by $t_d/T_s$ and $V_\\text{dc}$, which is approximately independent of the modulation index $m$. Because the commanded fundamental amplitude is proportional to $m$, the ratio of error to commanded amplitude increases as $m$ decreases.\n\nD. The dead time mainly affects transitions near the carrier extrema where $d$ approaches $0$ or $1$. At low modulation indices $m \\to 0$, the duty spends most of the time near these extrema, so the fractional impact grows because extreme duty conditions are more frequent.\n\nE.

It is a standard, well-posed problem in the field of power electronics.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. I will proceed with deriving the solution and evaluating the options.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis of dead-time effects in a voltage source inverter leg is fundamental. Let the top transistor be $S_1$ and the bottom transistor be $S_2$. The output voltage of the leg, $V_{out}$, is $V_\\text{dc}$ when $S_1$ conducts and $0$ when $S_2$ conducts (assuming the negative DC rail is the reference).\n\n**1. Ideal Operation (No Dead Time)**\nIn ideal PWM, the average output voltage over one switching period $T_s$ is directly proportional to the commanded duty cycle $d$:\n$$V_{avg, ideal} = d \\cdot V_\\text{dc}$$\n\n**2. Operation with Dead Time ($t_d$)**\nDuring the dead time $t_d$, both $S_1$ and $S_2$ are commanded to be off. The path for the load current $i$ is provided by the freewheeling body diodes. The output voltage during this interval is determined by which diode conducts.\n\n*   **Case 1: Positive Current ($i > 0$)**\n    The current is flowing out of the inverter leg. To maintain this flow when both switches are off, the current must find a path to the negative DC rail. This path is through the body diode of the bottom transistor, $S_2$. Conduction of the bottom diode clamps the output voltage $V_{out}$ to $0$.\n\n*   **Case 2: Negative Current ($i < 0$)**\n    The current is flowing into the inverter leg. The path for this current is from the positive DC rail through the body diode of the top transistor, $S_1$. Conduction of the top diode clamps the output voltage $V_{out}$ to $V_\\text{dc}$.\n\n**3. Impact on Effective Duty Cycle**\nA dead time $t_d$ is inserted at each transition (from $S_1$ to $S_2$ and from $S_2$ to $S_1$). Let's analyze the effect on the total time the output is high ($V_{out} = V_\\text{dc}$) within a period $T_s$.\n\n*   **For $i > 0$:** The output is forced to $0$ during the dead time. This effectively eats into the on-time of the top switch $S_1$. For each switching cycle, there is a low-to-high and a high-to-low transition. The dead time causes a loss of high-voltage time. A standard analysis shows the total on-time is reduced by $t_d$. The actual high-voltage duration becomes $d T_s - t_d$. The effective duty cycle $d_\\text{eff}$ is:\n    $$d_\\text{eff} = \\frac{d T_s - t_d}{T_s} = d - \\frac{t_d}{T_s}$$\n    This results in an average voltage error of $\\Delta V_{avg} = (d_\\text{eff} - d)V_\\text{dc} = -\\frac{t_d}{T_s} V_\\text{dc}$. The output voltage is lower than commanded.\n\n*   **For $i < 0$:** The output is forced to $V_\\text{dc}$ during the dead time. This effectively extends the on-time of the top switch $S_1$. The actual high-voltage duration becomes $d T_s + t_d$. The effective duty cycle $d_\\text{eff}$ is:\n    $$d_\\text{eff} = \\frac{d T_s + t_d}{T_s} = d + \\frac{t_d}{T_s}$$\n    This results in an average voltage error of $\\Delta V_{avg} = (d_\\text{eff} - d)V_\\text{dc} = +\\frac{t_d}{T_s} V_\\text{dc}$. The output voltage is higher than commanded.\n\n**4. Pulse Truncation/Dropping**\nThe effective duty cycle must remain in the range $[0, 1]$.\n*   For $i > 0$, if the commanded duty is very small, such that $d < t_d/T_s$, the effective duty cycle would become negative. Physically, this means the turn-on pulse is shorter than the dead time, so the top switch never effectively turns on. The output remains low for the entire period. Thus, $d_\\text{eff}$ is more accurately described as $d_\\text{eff} = \\max\\left(0, d - t_d/T_s\\right)$.\n*   For $i < 0$, if the commanded duty is close to unity, such that $d + t_d/T_s > 1$, the effective duty cycle cannot exceed $1$. This occurs when the commanded off-time for the top switch, $(1-d)T_s$, is less than $t_d$. The output remains high for the entire period. Thus, $d_\\text{eff} = \\min\\left(1, d + t_d/T_s\\right)$.\n\n**5. Impact at Low Modulation Index ($m$)**\nThe magnitude of the voltage error per switching cycle is $|\\Delta V_{avg}| = \\frac{t_d}{T_s} V_\\text{dc}$. This value is determined by fixed parameters ($t_d$, $T_s$, $V_\\text{dc}$) and is therefore approximately constant, independent of the modulation index $m$.\n\nThe commanded fundamental component of the inverter's output voltage has an amplitude that is proportional to the modulation index, $m$. For SPWM, the peak fundamental line-to-neutral voltage is $V_{1, \\text{peak}} = m \\frac{V_\\text{dc}}{2}$.\n\nThe fractional significance (or relative error) is the ratio of the error voltage magnitude to the commanded signal magnitude. Averaged over a fundamental cycle, the dead-time effect introduces an error voltage whose fundamental component has a magnitude that is roughly constant, let's call it $V_{\\text{err},1}$. The commanded fundamental is $V_{1, \\text{peak}} \\propto m$.\nThe fractional impact is therefore:\n$$\\text{Fractional Impact} \\propto \\frac{V_{\\text{err},1}}{V_{1, \\text{peak}}} \\propto \\frac{1}{m}$$\nAs the modulation index $m$ decreases (e.g., for low-speed operation of a motor), the commanded voltage becomes very small, but the absolute error voltage from dead time remains the same. Consequently, the relative distortion becomes very large.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Under positive leg current $i>0$, the leg clamps to the low level during dead time via the bottom diode, which subtracts a fixed time $t_d$ from the effective high-level conduction in each period; under negative leg current $i<0$, the leg clamps to the high level via the top diode, adding a fixed time $t_d$ to the effective high-level conduction. Thus $d_\\text{eff} = \\max\\!\\big(0,\\, d - t_d/T_s\\big)$ for $i>0$ and $d_\\text{eff} = \\min\\!\\big(1,\\, d + t_d/T_s\\big)$ for $i<0$, so commanded pulses near $d=0$ or $d=1$ are truncated and can vanish when $d < t_d/T_s$ or $1-d < t_d/T_s$.**\n\nThis statement is a comprehensive and accurate description of the dead-time effect. It correctly identifies the physical mechanism (clamping via diodes based on current direction), the mathematical result for the effective duty cycle (subtractive for $i>0$, additive for $i<0$), and the consequence of pulse truncation/elimination near the boundaries of the duty cycle range using the $\\max()$ and $\\min()$ functions. The conditions for vanishing pulses, $d < t_d/T_s$ and $1-d < t_d/T_s$, are also correctly stated. This statement aligns perfectly with the derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Dead time scales the effective duty multiplicatively and independently of current polarity, so $d_\\text{eff} = d \\big(1 - t_d/T_s\\big)$ for all $d \\in [0,1]$, making the relative error constant across duty cycle and modulation index.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect on multiple counts. First, the effect of dead time is an additive/subtractive time offset, not a multiplicative scaling of the duty cycle. Second, the effect is critically dependent on the current polarity, which this statement incorrectly claims it is independent of. The proposed equation would imply an error proportional to $d$, which contradicts the established model of a fixed volt-second error.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. In sinusoidal PWM, the dead-time-induced average voltage error per switching period has magnitude set primarily by $t_d/T_s$ and $V_\\text{dc}$, which is approximately independent of the modulation index $m$. Because the commanded fundamental amplitude is proportional to $m$, the ratio of error to commanded amplitude increases as $m$ decreases.**\n\nThis statement correctly analyzes the relative impact of dead time. The magnitude of the voltage error per cycle, $|\\Delta V_{avg}| = (t_d/T_s)V_\\text{dc}$, is indeed independent of $m$. The commanded fundamental voltage amplitude is proportional to $m$. The ratio of a constant error to a signal proportional to $m$ is proportional to $1/m$. Therefore, the fractional impact of the error grows as $m$ decreases. This is a critical issue in high-performance drives at low speeds.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**D. The dead time mainly affects transitions near the carrier extrema where $d$ approaches $0$ or $1$. At low modulation indices $m \\to 0$, the duty spends most of the time near these extrema, so the fractional impact grows because extreme duty conditions are more frequent.**\n\nThis statement contains flawed reasoning. The first premise is misleading; the voltage error $\\pm (t_d/T_s)V_\\text{dc}$ occurs at every switching event, not just near $d=0$ or $d=1$. The second premise is factually wrong: for a low modulation index $m \\to 0$, the duty cycle $d(t) = (1 + m \\sin(\\omega t))/2$ hovers very close to $0.5$, not near the extrema $0$ and $1$. The duty cycle only approaches the extrema for high modulation indices ($m \\approx 1$). The conclusion is based on incorrect premises.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. Dead time introduces only a zero-sequence voltage that cancels in line-to-line quantities, so its fractional impact on the torque-producing fundamental component is negligible for any $m$.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The voltage error in each phase depends on the sign of that phase's current ($\\Delta V_k = \\text{sgn}(i_k) (t_d/T_s) V_\\text{dc}$ for phase $k \\in \\{a, b, c\\}$). Since in a balanced three-phase system the currents sum to zero ($i_a+i_b+i_c=0$) but are phase-shifted, their signs are not always the same. Therefore, the phase voltage errors do not form a pure zero-sequence system. The errors do not cancel in the line-to-line voltages (e.g., $\\Delta V_{ab} = \\Delta V_a - \\Delta V_b \\neq 0$ in general), meaning the dead time distorts the differential-mode, torque-producing voltage components. Furthermore, as established in option C, the impact is far from negligible, especially for small $m$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",

The description of the inverter, PWM strategy, and the physical effect of dead-time on leg voltages are standard and factually correct. The problem is well-posed; it provides a clear objective, all necessary conditions (switching sequence, current directions), and constraints to determine a unique solution for the requested compensation times. The provided numerical values are physically realistic for such an application. The problem statement is objective and uses precise terminology. There are no contradictions, missing data, or scientific-factual unsoundness.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. The solution will now be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe fundamental principle of dead-time compensation is to adjust the dwell times of the switching states to produce a compensating voltage that is equal and opposite to the average voltage error introduced by the dead-time over one sampling period $T_s$.\n\nWe will first determine the volt-second error for each phase leg ($a, b, c$) by analyzing the switching transitions and the effect of dead-time. The total volt-second error for a phase $x$ is denoted by $\\int_0^{T_s} \\Delta v_x(t) dt$, where $\\Delta v_x(t)$ is the instantaneous voltage error.\n\nThe switching sequence is $\\mathrm{S}_0 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{S}_1 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{S}_2 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{S}_0$.\nThe states are defined as per-leg voltage levels:\n$\\mathrm{S}_0 = [v_a, v_b, v_c] = [O, O, O] = [0, 0, 0]$\n$\\mathrm{S}_1 = [v_a, v_b, v_c] = [P, O, O] = [V_{\\mathrm{dc}}/2, 0, 0]$\n$\\mathrm{S}_2 = [v_a, v_b, v_c] = [O, P, O] = [0, V_{\\mathrm{dc}}/2, 0]$\n\nLet's analyze the transitions and the switching actions for each leg:\n1.  **Transition $\\mathrm{S}_0 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{S}_1$**: Leg 'a' switches $O \\rightarrow P$. Legs 'b' and 'c' do not switch.\n2.  **Transition $\\mathrm{S}_1 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{S}_2$**: Leg 'a' switches $P \\rightarrow O$. Leg 'b' switches $O \\rightarrow P$. Leg 'c' does not switch.\n3.  **Transition $\\mathrm{S}_2 \\rightarrow \\mathrm{S}_0$**: Leg 'b' switches $P \\rightarrow O$. Legs 'a' and 'c' do not switch.\n\nDuring a dead-time interval $t_d$, the actual voltage of a leg is determined by the direction of the phase current. If the current $i_x$ is positive (flowing out of the leg), the leg voltage is clamped to the lower of the two potentials involved in the switch. If the current is negative (flowing into the leg), it is clamped to the higher potential.\n\n**Analysis for Leg 'a'**:\nLeg 'a' switches twice per cycle: $O \\rightarrow P$ and $P \\rightarrow O$. The phase current sign is given as $\\operatorname{sgn}(i_a) = +1$.\nFor a leg switching between levels $O$ ($0$) and $P$ ($+V_{\\mathrm{dc}}/2$), a positive current will cause the leg voltage to be clamped to the lower potential, which is $O=0$, during the dead-time.\n-   **At transition $O \\rightarrow P$**: The intended voltage becomes $P$. During the dead-time $t_d$, the actual voltage is clamped to $O$. The instantaneous voltage error is $\\Delta v_a = v_{\\text{actual}} - v_{\\text{intended}} = O - P = -V_{\\mathrm{dc}}/2$. The volt-second error for this transition is $(-V_{\\mathrm{dc}}/2) \\cdot t_d$.\n-   **At transition $P \\rightarrow O$**: In a symmetric sequence, this is the second transition for leg 'a'. The pulse at state P is effectively shortened. The total volt-second error per cycle is the sum of errors at the leading and trailing edges of the pulse. Both contribute negatively for a positive current. The total volt-second loss is effectively $(P-O) \\times 2t_d$. However, a simpler method is to sum the errors at each transition. For the P->O transition, the voltage before is P, but during dead-time it is clamped to O. The intended final state is O. The error is effectively a loss of volt-seconds at level P. The total volt-second loss for a pulse of state P is $(V_{dc}/2) \\times 2t_d = V_{dc}t_d$. The volt-second error is therefore $-V_{dc} t_d$.\n\nThe total volt-second error for leg 'a' over one sampling period $T_s$ is:\n$$ \\mathcal{E}_a = \\int_0^{T_s} \\Delta v_a(t) dt = -V_{\\mathrm{dc}} t_d $$\n\n**Analysis for Leg 'b'**:\nLeg 'b' also switches twice: $O \\rightarrow P$ and $P \\rightarrow O$. The phase current sign is $\\operatorname{sgn}(i_b) = +1$. The logic is identical to leg 'a'.\nThe total volt-second error for leg 'b' is:\n$$ \\mathcal{E}_b = \\int_0^{T_s} \\Delta v_b(t) dt = -V_{\\mathrm{dc}} t_d $$\n\n**Analysis for Leg 'c'**:\nLeg 'c' does not switch states; its level remains $O$ throughout the sequence. Therefore, no dead-time is inserted, and there is no associated voltage error.\n$$ \\mathcal{E}_c = \\int_0^{T_s} \\Delta v_c(t) dt = 0 $$\n\nNow, we must find the changes in dwell times, $\\Delta t_0, \\Delta t_1, \\Delta t_2$, that generate a compensating volt-second product equal to $-\\mathcal{E}_x$ for each phase $x$.\nThe volt-second product generated by the compensation is:\n$$ \\mathcal{C}_x = \\Delta t_0 v_{x,S0} + \\Delta t_1 v_{x,S1} + \\Delta t_2 v_{x,S2} $$\nWe require $\\mathcal{C}_x = -\\mathcal{E}_x$ for $x \\in \\{a, b, c\\}$.\n\nUsing the voltage levels for each state:\nFor phase 'a':\n$$ \\mathcal{C}_a = \\Delta t_0(0) + \\Delta t_1(V_{\\mathrm{dc}}/2) + \\Delta t_2(0) = \\Delta t_1 \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{2} $$\nSetting $\\mathcal{C}_a = -\\mathcal{E}_a$:\n$$ \\Delta t_1 \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{2} = -(-V_{\\mathrm{dc}} t_d) = V_{\\mathrm{dc}} t_d $$\n$$ \\Delta t_1 = 2 t_d $$\n\nFor phase 'b':\n$$ \\mathcal{C}_b = \\Delta t_0(0) + \\Delta t_1(0) + \\Delta t_2(V_{\\mathrm{dc}}/2) = \\Delta t_2 \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{2} $$\nSetting $\\mathcal{C}_b = -\\mathcal{E}_b$:\n$$ \\Delta t_2 \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{dc}}}{2} = -(-V_{\\mathrm{dc}} t_d) = V_{\\mathrm{dc}} t_d $$\n$$ \\Delta t_2 = 2 t_d $$\n\nFor phase 'c':\n$$ \\mathcal{C}_c = \\Delta t_0(0) + \\Delta t_1(0) + \\Delta t_2(0) = 0 $$\nSetting $\\mathcal{C}_c = -\\mathcal{E}_c$:\n$$ 0 = -(0) $$\nThis equation is satisfied identically and provides no information for the time adjustments, which is expected since leg 'c' had no error to compensate.\n\nFinally, we use the constraint that the total sampling period is preserved:\n$$ \\Delta t_0 + \\Delta t_1 + \\Delta t_2 = 0 $$\nSubstituting the values we found for $\\Delta t_1$ and $\\Delta t_2$:\n$$ \\Delta t_0 + 2 t_d + 2 t_d = 0 $$\n$$ \\Delta t_0 = -4 t_d $$\n\nThe required compensating adjustments are:\n$\\Delta t_1 = 2 t_d$\n$\\Delta t_2 = 2 t_d$\n$\\Delta t_0 = -4 t_d$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical value $t_d = 1.5\\,\\mu \\mathrm{s}$:\n$$ \\Delta t_1 = 2 \\times (1.5\\,\\mu \\mathrm{s}) = 3.0\\,\\mu \\mathrm{s} $$\n$$ \\Delta t_2 = 2 \\times (1.5\\,\\mu \\mathrm{s}) = 3.0\\,\\mu \\mathrm{s} $$\n$$ \\Delta t_0 = -4 \\times (1.5\\,\\mu \\mathrm{s}) = -6.0\\,\\mu \\mathrm{s} $$\n\nThe question asks for the answer as a row matrix $[\\Delta t_1 \\ \\Delta t_2 \\ \\Delta t_0]$ in microseconds, rounded to three significant figures.\nThe calculated values are $3.0$, $3.0$, and $-6.0$.
