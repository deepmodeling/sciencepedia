            "solution": "First, we determine the parameters of the current waveform. The switching period, $T$, is the reciprocal of the switching frequency, $f_{\\text{s}}$:\n$$T = \\frac{1}{f_{\\text{s}}} = \\frac{1}{200 \\times 10^{3} \\text{ Hz}} = 5 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ s} = 5.0 \\,\\mu\\text{s}$$\nDuring the conduction interval $\\tau_{\\text{c}}$, a voltage of magnitude $V_{\\text{in}}$ is applied across the series inductance $L_{\\text{s}}$. From the fundamental inductor equation, $v = L \\, di/dt$, we can find the total change in current, $\\Delta I$, over this interval. Approximating $di/dt$ as $\\Delta I / \\tau_{\\text{c}}$ for a linear ramp:\n$$\\Delta I = \\frac{V_{\\text{in}}}{L_{\\text{s}}} \\tau_{\\text{c}} = \\frac{400 \\text{ V}}{80 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ H}} \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ s}) = 5 \\text{ A}$$\nThe instantaneous current $i(t)$ through the MOSFET is non-zero only during its conduction window.

We must compute the exact mean-square current, $I_{\\text{RMS, exact}}^{2}$, over one period $T$. A known result for the mean-square value of a current ramp symmetric about $I_{\\text{ref}}$ with total ripple $\\Delta I$ is $I_{\\text{ref}}^{2} + \\frac{\\Delta I^{2}}{12}$. This is the mean-square value *during* the conduction window.\nTo find the RMS value over the full period $T$, we multiply by the duty cycle of the conduction, which is $\\tau_{\\text{c}}/T$:\n$$I_{\\text{RMS, exact}}^{2} = \\frac{\\tau_{\\text{c}}}{T} \\left( I_{\\text{ref}}^{2} + \\frac{\\Delta I^{2}}{12} \\right)$$\nThe exact power loss, $P_{\\text{exact}}$, is:\n$$P_{\\text{exact}} = R_{\\text{on}} I_{\\text{RMS, exact}}^{2} = R_{\\text{on}} \\frac{\\tau_{\\text{c}}}{T} \\left( I_{\\text{ref}}^{2} + \\frac{\\Delta I^{2}}{12} \\right)$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$P_{\\text{exact}} = (0.020 \\,\\Omega) \\times \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ s}}{5.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ s}} \\left( (10 \\text{ A})^{2} + \\frac{(5 \\text{ A})^{2}}{12} \\right)$$\n$$P_{\\text{exact}} = (0.004) \\left( 100 + \\frac{25}{12} \\right) \\text{ W} = (0.004)(100 + 2.08333...) \\text{ W} = 0.408333... \\text{ W}$$\n\n3) **Absolute Difference $\\lvert P_{\\text{exact}} - P_{\\text{est}} \\rvert$**\nThe absolute difference between the exact and estimated power losses is:\n$$\\lvert P_{\\text{exact}} - P_{\\text{est}} \\rvert = \\left| R_{\\text{on}} \\frac{\\tau_{\\text{c}}}{T} \\left( I_{\\text{ref}}^{2} + \\frac{\\Delta I^{2}}{12} \\right) - R_{\\text{on}} \\frac{\\tau_{\\text{c}}}{T} I_{\\text{ref}}^{2} \\right|$$\n$$\\lvert P_{\\text{exact}} - P_{\\text{est}} \\rvert = \\left| R_{\\text{on}} \\frac{\\tau_{\\text{c}}}{T} \\frac{\\Delta I^{2}}{12} \\right|$$\nSince all terms are positive, the absolute value is redundant.\n$$\\lvert P_{\\text{exact}} - P_{\\text{est}} \\rvert = (0.020 \\,\\Omega) \\times \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ s}}{5.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ s}} \\times \\frac{(5 \\text{ A})^{2}}{12} = (0.004) \\times \\frac{25}{12} \\text{ W}$$\n$$\\lvert P_{\\text{exact}} - P_{\\text{est}} \\rvert = \\frac{0.1}{12} \\text{ W} = \\frac{1}{120} \\text{ W} \\approx 0.0083333... \\text{ W}$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $0.008333 \\text{ W}$.",

Center-Tapped Full-Wave (FW) Rectifier Analysis**\n\nIn a full-bridge converter, the primary of the transformer is supplied with a bipolar voltage waveform. For a duration of $D T_s$, the voltage is $+V_{\\mathrm{in}}$, and for another duration of $D T_s$ in the second half of the switching period, the voltage is $-V_{\\mathrm{in}}$. The center-tapped secondary has a total of $N_{s}^{\\mathrm{fw}}$ turns, split into two identical half-windings of $N_{s}^{\\mathrm{fw}}/2$ turns each. Let the primary have $N_{p}$ turns. The turns ratio for one half-winding is $n_{\\mathrm{fw}} = \\frac{N_{s}^{\\mathrm{fw}}/2}{N_{p}}$.\n\nWhen the primary voltage is positive, the voltage across the upper half-winding is $n_{\\mathrm{fw}} V_{\\mathrm{in}}$, and the upper synchronous rectifier conducts. When the primary voltage is negative, the voltage across the lower half-winding is also of magnitude $n_{\\mathrm{fw}} V_{\\mathrm{in}}$ (with respect to the center tap), and the lower rectifier conducts. The rectified voltage at the input of the output filter is a pulse train with amplitude $n_{\\mathrm{fw}} V_{\\mathrm{in}}$ and duration $D T_s$ occurring twice per switching period $T_s$. The period of the rectified voltage is $T_s/2$. The effective duty cycle of this rectified voltage is $D' = \\frac{D T_s}{T_s/2} = 2D$.\n\nThe average rectified voltage $\\langle v_{\\text{rect,fw}} \\rangle$ is given by:\n$$ \\langle v_{\\text{rect,fw}} \\rangle = D' \\times (\\text{pulse amplitude}) = (2D)(n_{\\mathrm{fw}} V_{\\mathrm{in}}) $$\nBy the principle of volt-second balance for the output inductor in continuous conduction mode (CCM), the average voltage across the inductor must be zero. This requires the average rectified voltage to equal the output voltage $V_o$.\n$$ V_o = 2 D n_{\\mathrm{fw}} V_{\\mathrm{in}} $$\nThe transformer must be designed to support the full input voltage range. The turns ratio is determined at the minimum input voltage $V_{\\mathrm{in,min}}$, where the duty ratio is maximum, $D_{\\max}$.\n$$ V_o = 2 D_{\\max} n_{\\mathrm{fw}} V_{\\mathrm{in,min}} $$\nSolving for the turns ratio $n_{\\mathrm{fw}}$:\n$$ n_{\\mathrm{fw}} = \\frac{N_{s}^{\\mathrm{fw}}/2}{N_p} = \\frac{V_o}{2 D_{\\max} V_{\\mathrm{in,min}}} $$\nNext, we analyze the secondary current. With negligible ripple, the output inductor current is constant at $I_o$. Each half-winding supplies this full current $I_o$ when it is active. The upper half-winding conducts for a duration $D T_s$ in the first half of the cycle, and the lower half-winding conducts for a duration $D T_s$ in the second half. Over one full switching period $T_s$, the current in one specific half-winding, $i_{s,\\mathrm{fw}}(t)$, is a pulse of magnitude $I_o$ for a duration of $D T_s$ and is zero for the rest of the period $(T_s - D T_s)$.\n\nThe RMS current in one half-winding, $I_{\\mathrm{rms,fw}}$, is calculated over a full period $T_s$:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{rms,fw}}^2 = \\frac{1}{T_s} \\int_{0}^{T_s} i_{s,\\mathrm{fw}}^2(t) \\, \\mathrm{d}t = \\frac{1}{T_s} \\int_{0}^{D T_s} I_o^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}t = \\frac{I_o^2 (D T_s)}{T_s} = D I_o^2 $$\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{rms,fw}} = I_o \\sqrt{D} $$\nAt the specified operating point, $D = D_{\\max}$.\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{rms,fw}} = I_o \\sqrt{D_{\\max}} $$\n\n**2. Current-Doubler (CD) Rectifier Analysis**\n\nThe current-doubler topology uses a single secondary winding with $N_{s}^{\\mathrm{cd}}$ turns, feeding two separate output inductors. Let the turns ratio be $n_{\\mathrm{cd}} = \\frac{N_{s}^{\\mathrm{cd}}}{N_p}$. The secondary voltage $v_s(t)$ is a bipolar square wave with amplitude $n_{\\mathrm{cd}} V_{\\mathrm{in}}$.\n\nLet's apply volt-second balance to one of the output inductors, say $L_1$.\nFor the interval $t \\in [0, D T_s]$, the primary voltage is $+V_{\\mathrm{in}}$, so $v_s(t) = n_{\\mathrm{cd}} V_{\\mathrm{in}}$. The corresponding synchronous rectifier turns on, and the voltage across inductor $L_1$ is $v_{L1} = v_s(t) - V_o = n_{\\mathrm{cd}} V_{\\mathrm{in}} - V_o$.\nFor the remainder of the period, $t \\in [D T_s, T_s]$, either the primary is shorted ($v_s=0$) or the other half of the bridge is active ($v_s<0$). In both cases, inductor $L_1$ freewheels through its own synchronous rectifier, applying a voltage $v_{L1} = -V_o$.\n\nThe integral of the inductor voltage over one period $T_s$ must be zero:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{T_s} v_{L1}(t) \\, \\mathrm{d}t = \\int_{0}^{D T_s} (n_{\\mathrm{cd}} V_{\\mathrm{in}} - V_o) \\, \\mathrm{d}t + \\int_{D T_s}^{T_s} (-V_o) \\, \\mathrm{d}t = 0 $$\n$$ (n_{\\mathrm{cd}} V_{\\mathrm{in}} - V_o) D T_s - V_o (T_s - D T_s) = 0 $$\n$$ n_{\\mathrm{cd}} V_{\\mathrm{in}} D T_s - V_o D T_s - V_o T_s + V_o D T_s = 0 $$\n$$ n_{\\mathrm{cd}} V_{\\mathrm{in}} D T_s = V_o T_s $$\nThis simplifies to the voltage transfer ratio for the current-doubler:\n$$ V_o = D n_{\\mathrm{cd}} V_{\\mathrm{in}} $$\nUsing the design condition at $V_{\\mathrm{in,min}}$ and $D_{\\max}$:\n$$ V_o = D_{\\max} n_{\\mathrm{cd}} V_{\\mathrm{in,min}} $$\nSolving for the turns ratio $n_{\\mathrm{cd}}$:\n$$ n_{\\mathrm{cd}} = \\frac{N_{s}^{\\mathrm{cd}}}{N_p} = \\frac{V_o}{D_{\\max} V_{\\mathrm{in,min}}} $$\nFor the secondary current analysis, the total output current $I_o$ is the sum of the two inductor currents, $I_o = i_{L1} + i_{L2}$. Due to circuit symmetry and the negligible ripple assumption, the inductor currents are constant and equal: $i_{L1} = i_{L2} = I_o/2$.\nThe current in the single secondary winding, $i_{s,\\mathrm{cd}}(t)$, is composed of the currents charging the inductors.\n- For $t \\in [0, D T_s]$, $v_s > 0$ and $L_1$ is charged. $i_{s,\\mathrm{cd}}(t) = i_{L1} = I_o/2$.\n- For $t \\in [D T_s, T_s/2]$, $v_s = 0$. $i_{s,\\mathrm{cd}}(t) = 0$.\n- For $t \\in [T_s/2, T_s/2 + D T_s]$, $v_s < 0$ and $L_2$ is charged. The current flows in the opposite direction through the winding. $i_{s,\\mathrm{cd}}(t) = -i_{L2} = -I_o/2$.\n- For $t \\in [T_s/2+D T_s, T_s]$, $v_s = 0$. $i_{s,\\mathrm{cd}}(t) = 0$.\n\nThe secondary current waveform is a bipolar pulse train. The RMS current $I_{\\mathrm{rms,cd}}$ is:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{rms,cd}}^2 = \\frac{1}{T_s} \\int_{0}^{T_s} i_{s,\\mathrm{cd}}^2(t) \\, \\mathrm{d}t = \\frac{1}{T_s} \\left[ \\int_{0}^{D T_s} \\left(\\frac{I_o}{2}\\right)^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}t + \\int_{T_s/2}^{T_s/2+D T_s} \\left(-\\frac{I_o}{2}\\right)^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}t \\right] $$\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{rms,cd}}^2 = \\frac{1}{T_s} \\left[ \\frac{I_o^2}{4} (D T_s) + \\frac{I_o^2}{4} (D T_s) \\right] = \\frac{1}{T_s} \\left( 2 \\frac{I_o^2 D T_s}{4} \\right) = \\frac{D I_o^2}{2} $$\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{rms,cd}} = I_o \\sqrt{\\frac{D}{2}} $$\nAt the specified operating point, $D = D_{\\max}$.\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{rms,cd}} = I_o \\sqrt{\\frac{D_{\\max}}{2}} = \\frac{I_o \\sqrt{D_{\\max}}}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\n\n**3. Ratio Calculation and Conclusion**\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio $r = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{rms,cd}}}{I_{\\mathrm{rms,fw}}}$ at the operating point defined by $V_{\\mathrm{in,min}}$ and $D_{\\max}$.\nUsing the expressions derived above:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{rms,fw}} = I_o \\sqrt{D_{\\max}} $$\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{rms,cd}} = \\frac{I_o \\sqrt{D_{\\max}}}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\nThe ratio $r$ is:\n$$ r = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{rms,cd}}}{I_{\\mathrm{rms,fw}}} = \\frac{\\frac{I_o \\sqrt{D_{\\max}}}{\\sqrt{2}}}{I_o \\sqrt{D_{\\max}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\nThe ratio is independent of the specific values of $I_o$ and $D_{\\max}$, as long as they are non-zero.\nNumerically, the ratio is:\n$$ r = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\approx 0.70710678... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $r = 0.7071$.\n\nSince $r \\approx 0.7071 < 1$, it is clear that $I_{\\mathrm{rms,cd}} < I_{\\mathrm{rms,fw}}$. Specifically, the RMS current in the single secondary winding of the current-doubler topology is approximately $70.71\\%$ of the RMS current in one of the half-windings of the center-tapped topology. Since copper losses are proportional to the square of the RMS current ($P_{\\mathrm{loss}} = I_{\\mathrm{rms}}^2 R$), the current-doubler secondary offers significantly lower copper losses in the transformer secondary winding compared to the center-tapped design, assuming the same total copper volume or resistance per turn. Therefore, the current-doubler topology yields lower secondary RMS current.",

The problem can be solved by considering the conservation of energy in the resonant circuit formed by the transformer leakage inductance $L_{\\ell}$ and the effective nodal capacitance $C_{\\mathrm{eq}}$.\n\nAt the moment a MOSFET carrying current $I_{\\mathrm{turn\\text{-}off}}$ is turned off ($t=0$), the total energy in this LC system is the sum of the magnetic energy stored in the inductor and the electric potential energy stored in the capacitor, which is initially charged to the bus voltage, $V_{\\mathrm{bus,surge}}$.\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{1}{2} L_{\\ell} I_{\\mathrm{turn\\text{-}off}}^2 + \\frac{1}{2} C_{\\mathrm{eq}} V_{\\mathrm{bus,surge}}^2$$\nThis energy is conserved in the ideal LC tank. The peak drain-to-source voltage, $V_{\\mathrm{DS,peak}}$, occurs when the inductor current momentarily passes through zero and all the system's energy has been transferred to the capacitor. At this instant, the total energy is purely capacitive:\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{1}{2} C_{\\mathrm{eq}} V_{\\mathrm{DS,peak}}^2$$\nEquating the two expressions for total energy allows us to solve for $V_{\\mathrm{DS,peak}}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} C_{\\mathrm{eq}} V_{\\mathrm{DS,peak}}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} L_{\\ell} I_{\\mathrm{turn\\text{-}off}}^2 + \\frac{1}{2} C_{\\mathrm{eq}} V_{\\mathrm{bus,surge}}^2$$\n$$V_{\\mathrm{DS,peak}}^2 = \\frac{L_{\\ell}}{C_{\\mathrm{eq}}} I_{\\mathrm{turn\\text{-}off}}^2 + V_{\\mathrm{bus,surge}}^2$$\n$$V_{\\mathrm{DS,peak}} = \\sqrt{V_{\\mathrm{bus,surge}}^2 + \\left(I_{\\mathrm{turn\\text{-}off}} \\sqrt{\\frac{L_{\\ell}}{C_{\\mathrm{eq}}}}\\right)^2}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression.\nGiven:\n-   $V_{\\mathrm{bus,surge}} = 600\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n-   $I_{\\mathrm{turn\\text{-}off}} = 12\\,\\mathrm{A}$\n-   $L_{\\ell} = 2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{H} = 2 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{H}$\n-   $C_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 5\\,\\mathrm{nF} = 5 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{F}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the squared overshoot voltage component:\n$$\\Delta V^2 = \\frac{L_{\\ell}}{C_{\\mathrm{eq}}} I_{\\mathrm{turn\\text{-}off}}^2 = \\left(\\frac{2 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{H}}{5 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{F}}\\right) \\times (12\\,\\mathrm{A})^2 = (400\\,\\Omega^2) \\times (144\\,\\mathrm{A}^2) = 57600\\,\\mathrm{V}^2$$\nThe amplitude of the resonant voltage component is $\\sqrt{57600\\,\\mathrm{V}^2} = 240\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n\nFinally, we determine the total peak drain-to-source voltage $V_{\\mathrm{DS,peak}}$ using the root-sum-square relationship derived from energy conservation:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{DS,peak}} = \\sqrt{(600\\,\\mathrm{V})^2 + 57600\\,\\mathrm{V}^2} = \\sqrt{360000 + 57600}\\,\\mathrm{V} = \\sqrt{417600}\\,\\mathrm{V} \\approx 646.220... \\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $646.2\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n\nFor the purpose of qualitative assessment, we compare this peak voltage to the derated maximum voltage. The device rating is $V_{\\mathrm{DS,max}} = 900\\,\\mathrm{V}$. A $10\\%$ derating implies a maximum design voltage of:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{design,max}} = V_{\\mathrm{DS,max}} \\times (1 - 0.10) = 900\\,\\mathrm{V} \\times 0.90 = 810\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nOur calculated peak stress is $V_{\\mathrm{DS,peak}} = 646.2\\,\\mathrm{V}$. Since $V_{\\mathrm{DS,peak}}  V_{\\mathrm{design,max}}$, the design meets the 10% safety margin during this specific surge event. However, the calculation shows that the overshoot adds a significant voltage stress of approximately $46.2\\,\\mathrm{V}$ above the $600\\,\\mathrm{V}$ bus. This underscores the importance of managing this parasitic energy, as more severe transients or larger manufacturing variations in leakage inductance could easily lead to voltages that exceed the safe operating area. The result highlights the necessity for snubbers or active clamps in robust designs.",
