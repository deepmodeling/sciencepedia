            "problem": "An ideal direct current (DC) boost converter with a single-pole switching leg is operated at a fixed duty cycle under open-loop control. The inductor current initially never reaches zero within a switching period, so the converter is in Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM). A sudden decrease in load power demand at time $t=0$ increases the load resistance and causes entry into Discontinuous Conduction Mode (DCM), with the duty cycle remaining fixed throughout the transient. The objective is to compute the new steady-state output voltage and the dominant output capacitor settling time constant in DCM from first principles.\n\nThe converter parameters are as follows: input voltage $V_g$, inductance $L$, output capacitance $C$, and switching frequency $f_s$ with period $T_s = 1/f_s$.

It describes a standard scenario in power electronics and provides all necessary parameters for a unique solution.\n\nThe solution is developed in two parts as requested: first, the derivation of the new steady-state output voltage in Discontinuous Conduction Mode (DCM), and second, the derivation of the output voltage settling time constant.\n\n**Part 1: DCM Steady-State Output Voltage**\n\nA boost converter operates in DCM when the inductor current falls to zero before the end of the switching period. In steady-state DCM, one switching period $T_s$ consists of three distinct intervals defined by the state of the switch (transistor) and the diode. Let the duty cycle be $D$.\n\n1.  Interval 1 ($0 \\le t \\le DT_s$): The switch is ON, and the diode is OFF. The voltage across the inductor $L$ is the input voltage $V_g$. The inductor current $i_L(t)$ ramps up linearly from zero.\n    $$v_L(t) = V_g$$\n    The peak inductor current at the end of this interval is:\n    $$I_{L,pk} = \\frac{V_g}{L} (DT_s)$$\n\n2.  Interval 2 ($DT_s \\le t \\le (D+D_2)T_s$): The switch is OFF, and the diode is ON, transferring energy to the output. The voltage across the inductor is $V_g - V_o$. The inductor current ramps down.\n    $$v_L(t) = V_g - V_o$$\n    This interval ends when the inductor current reaches zero.\n\n3.  Interval 3 ($(D+D_2)T_s \\le t \\le T_s$): The switch is OFF, and the diode is OFF. The inductor current is zero. The inductor voltage is zero.\n    $$v_L(t) = 0$$\n\nIn steady state, the principle of inductor volt-second balance dictates that the average voltage across the inductor over one switching period must be zero.\n$$\\langle v_L \\rangle_{T_s} = \\frac{1}{T_s} \\int_0^{T_s} v_L(t) dt = 0$$\n$$V_g(DT_s) + (V_g - V_o)(D_2 T_s) + 0 \\cdot (T_s - (D+D_2)T_s) = 0$$\n$$D V_g + D_2 (V_g - V_o) = 0$$\nThis gives a relationship for $D_2$:\n$$D_2 = D \\frac{V_g}{V_o - V_g}$$\n\nNext, we apply the principle of capacitor charge balance. In steady state, the average current flowing into the output capacitor must be zero, meaning the average current supplied by the converter to the output stage equals the average load current $I_o = V_o/R$. The current is supplied to the output only during the second interval, $D_2 T_s$. The average current supplied over a full period $T_s$ is the area of the triangular current pulse during $D_2 T_s$ divided by $T_s$.\n$$I_o = \\frac{V_o}{R} = \\langle i_{diode} \\rangle_{T_s} = \\frac{1}{T_s} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} I_{L,pk} (D_2 T_s) \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} I_{L,pk} D_2$$\nSubstituting $I_{L,pk} = \\frac{V_g D T_s}{L}$:\n$$\\frac{V_o}{R} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{V_g D T_s}{L} \\right) D_2$$\n\nNow we solve for the voltage gain $M = V_o/V_g$ by eliminating $D_2$. Substitute the expression for $D_2$ from volt-second balance into the charge balance equation:\n$$\\frac{V_o}{R} = \\frac{D T_s V_g}{2L} \\left( D \\frac{V_g}{V_o - V_g} \\right)$$\n$$\\frac{V_o(V_o - V_g)}{R} = \\frac{D^2 T_s V_g^2}{2L}$$\nDividing the entire equation by $V_g^2$:\n$$\\frac{V_o}{V_g} \\left( \\frac{V_o}{V_g} - 1 \\right) = \\frac{R D^2 T_s}{2L}$$\nUsing the definitions $M = V_o/V_g$ and $K = \\frac{2L}{RT_s}$, we get:\n$$M(M-1) = \\frac{D^2}{K}$$\n$$M^2 - M - \\frac{D^2}{K} = 0$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $M$. Solving using the quadratic formula:\n$$M = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 4(1)(-\\frac{D^2}{K})}}{2} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{4D^2}{K}}}{2}$$\nSince a boost converter has $V_o \\ge V_g$, we must have $M \\ge 1$. We choose the positive root:\n$$M(D,K) = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{4D^2}{K}}}{2}$$\n\nNow we compute the new steady-state output voltage $V_o$ for $R = R_2 = 500\\ \\Omega$.\nFirst, calculate the parameter $K$ for the new load:\n$$K = \\frac{2 L}{R_2 T_s} = \\frac{2 \\times (200 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{H})}{(500\\ \\Omega) \\times (10 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{s})} = \\frac{400 \\times 10^{-6}}{5000 \\times 10^{-6}} = 0.08$$\nNow, compute the gain $M$ with $D=0.40$ and $K=0.08$:\n$$M = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{4(0.40)^2}{0.08}}}{2} = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{4(0.16)}{0.08}}}{2} = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{0.64}{0.08}}}{2} = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{1+8}}{2} = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{9}}{2} = \\frac{1+3}{2} = 2$$\nThe new steady-state output voltage is:\n$$V_o = M \\times V_g = 2 \\times 100\\ \\mathrm{V} = 200\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $V_o = 200.0\\ \\mathrm{V}$.\n\n**Part 2: DCM Settling Time Constant**\n\nWe use state-space averaging to find the dynamics of the output voltage. The averaged equation for the current in the output capacitor $C$ is:\n$$C \\frac{dv_o}{dt} = \\langle i_{diode} \\rangle_{T_s} - i_o$$\nwhere $v_o$ is the instantaneous averaged output voltage, $\\langle i_{diode} \\rangle_{T_s}$ is the averaged diode current, and $i_o = v_o/R$ is the load current. From Part 1, we have:\n$$\\langle i_{diode} \\rangle_{T_s} = \\frac{d^2 T_s v_g^2}{2L(v_o - v_g)}$$\nThe dynamic equation is:\n$$C \\frac{dv_o}{dt} = \\frac{d^2 T_s v_g^2}{2L(v_o - v_g)} - \\frac{v_o}{R}$$\nWe linearize this equation around the steady-state operating point ($V_g, V_o, D, R=R_2$) by considering small perturbations. Since the input voltage $V_g$ and duty cycle $D$ are fixed, we only have a perturbation in the output voltage: $v_o(t) = V_o + \\hat{v}_o(t)$.\n$$C \\frac{d(V_o + \\hat{v}_o)}{dt} = \\frac{D^2 T_s V_g^2}{2L((V_o+\\hat{v}_o) - V_g)} - \\frac{V_o+\\hat{v}_o}{R}$$\n$$C \\frac{d\\hat{v}_o}{dt} = \\frac{D^2 T_s V_g^2}{2L((V_o-V_g)+\\hat{v}_o)} - \\frac{V_o}{R} - \\frac{\\hat{v}_o}{R}$$\nWe perform a first-order Taylor expansion of the nonlinear term around $V_o$:\n$$\\frac{1}{(V_o-V_g)+\\hat{v}_o} \\approx \\frac{1}{V_o-V_g} - \\frac{\\hat{v}_o}{(V_o-V_g)^2}$$\nSubstituting this into the dynamic equation:\n$$C \\frac{d\\hat{v}_o}{dt} \\approx \\left[\\frac{D^2 T_s V_g^2}{2L(V_o-V_g)} - \\frac{V_o}{R}\\right] - \\frac{D^2 T_s V_g^2}{2L(V_o-V_g)^2} \\hat{v}_o - \\frac{\\hat{v}_o}{R}$$\nThe term in the square brackets is zero by the steady-state condition. The linearized small-signal equation becomes:\n$$C \\frac{d\\hat{v}_o}{dt} = -\\left( \\frac{D^2 T_s V_g^2}{2L(V_o-V_g)^2} + \\frac{1}{R} \\right) \\hat{v}_o$$\nFrom the steady-state analysis, we know $\\frac{V_o}{R} = \\frac{D^2 T_s V_g^2}{2L(V_o - V_g)}$. We can use this to simplify the first term in the parenthesis:\n$$\\frac{D^2 T_s V_g^2}{2L(V_o-V_g)^2} = \\left(\\frac{D^2 T_s V_g^2}{2L(V_o - V_g)}\\right) \\frac{1}{V_o-V_g} = \\frac{V_o/R}{V_o-V_g}$$\nSubstituting this back:\n$$C \\frac{d\\hat{v}_o}{dt} = -\\left( \\frac{V_o}{R(V_o-V_g)} + \\frac{1}{R} \\right) \\hat{v}_o$$\n$$C \\frac{d\\hat{v}_o}{dt} + \\frac{1}{R} \\left( \\frac{V_o}{V_o-V_g} + 1 \\right) \\hat{v}_o = 0$$\n$$C \\frac{d\\hat{v}_o}{dt} + \\frac{1}{R} \\left( \\frac{2V_o-V_g}{V_o-V_g} \\right) \\hat{v}_o = 0$$\nThis is a standard first-order differential equation of the form $\\frac{d\\hat{v}_o}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau}\\hat{v}_o = 0$.

Round both to three significant figures. The final answer must be a single row vector containing these two numbers.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the inductor inductance $L$ and switching frequency $f_s$ for an ideal DC-DC boost converter. The design must minimize $L$ while satisfying three constraints: a maximum switching frequency $f_s \\le f_{s,\\max}$, continuous conduction mode (CCM) operation down to the lightest load, and a maximum normalized current ripple at the heaviest load. The derivation will proceed from first principles.\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental operating equations for an ideal boost converter in periodic steady state.\nThe ideal voltage conversion ratio is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{V_o}{V_g} = \\frac{1}{1-D}\n$$\nwhere $V_g$ is the input voltage, $V_o$ is the output voltage, and $D$ is the duty ratio of the main switch. Given $V_g = 48\\ \\mathrm{V}$ and $V_o = 200\\ \\mathrm{V}$, the required duty ratio is constant:\n$$\nD = 1 - \\frac{V_g}{V_o} = 1 - \\frac{48}{200} = 1 - 0.24 = 0.76\n$$\n\nFor an ideal (lossless) converter, input power equals output power: $P_{in} = P_{out}$. This means $V_g I_g = V_o I_o$, where $I_g$ and $I_o$ are the average input and output currents, respectively. For a boost converter, the average inductor current $I_L$ is equal to the average input current $I_g$. The load is resistive, so $I_o = V_o/R$. Therefore, the average inductor current is a function of the load resistance $R$:\n$$\nI_L(R) = I_g = \\frac{V_o I_o}{V_g} = \\frac{V_o}{V_g} \\left(\\frac{V_o}{R}\\right) = \\frac{V_o^2}{V_g R}\n$$\n\nNext, we apply the principle of inductor volt-second balance. For an inductor $L$ in periodic steady state, the net change in magnetic flux over one switching period $T_s = 1/f_s$ is zero. This implies the time integral of the voltage across the inductor over one period is zero. When the switch is on for a duration $DT_s$, the inductor voltage is $v_L = V_g$. The inductor current increases linearly during this interval. The peak-to-peak ripple in the inductor current, $\\Delta i_L$, is the change in current during this time:\n$$\n\\Delta i_L = \\frac{V_g}{L} (DT_s) = \\frac{D V_g}{L f_s}\n$$\nNote that this ripple amplitude is independent of the load $R$.\n\nNow, we formalize the two design constraints on the inductor current.\n\nConstraint 1: CCM at lightest load.\nThe converter must remain in CCM over the entire load range $R \\in [R_{\\min}, R_{\\max}]$. The boundary between CCM and discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) occurs when the minimum inductor current touches zero. This happens when the average inductor current is half of the peak-to-peak ripple: $I_L = \\Delta i_L / 2$. To ensure CCM, we must have $I_L  \\Delta i_L / 2$, or equivalently $\\Delta i_L  2 I_L$. This condition must be met for all $R$. Since $I_L(R)$ is inversely proportional to $R$, the most challenging condition (smallest $I_L$) occurs at the lightest load, i.e., at $R = R_{\\max}$. The constraint states that the boundary condition must not be violated, which sets the design limit at the boundary:\n$$\n\\Delta i_L \\le 2 I_L(R_{\\max})\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\Delta i_L$ and $I_L(R_{\\max})$:\n$$\n\\frac{D V_g}{L f_s} \\le 2 \\frac{V_o^2}{V_g R_{\\max}}\n$$\nTo satisfy this, the inductance $L$ must meet a minimum value, which depends on $f_s$:\n$$\nL \\ge \\frac{D V_g^2 R_{\\max}}{2 f_s V_o^2}\n$$\nLet's call this lower bound $L_{1, \\min}(f_s)$.\n\nConstraint 2: Ripple limit at heaviest load.\nThe inductor current ripple normalized by the average inductor current must not exceed $\\rho = 0.25$ at the heaviest load, $R = R_{\\min}$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta i_L}{I_L(R_{\\min})} \\le \\rho\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\Delta i_L$ and $I_L(R_{\\min})$:\n$$\n\\frac{D V_g / (L f_s)}{V_o^2 / (V_g R_{\\min})} \\le \\rho\n$$\nRearranging for $L$:\n$$\n\\frac{D V_g^2 R_{\\min}}{L f_s V_o^2} \\le \\rho \\implies L \\ge \\frac{D V_g^2 R_{\\min}}{\\rho f_s V_o^2}\n$$\nLet's call this second lower bound $L_{2, \\min}(f_s)$.\n\nTo satisfy both constraints simultaneously, the inductance $L$ must be greater than or equal to the maximum of these two lower bounds:\n$$\nL \\ge \\max\\left(L_{1, \\min}(f_s), L_{2, \\min}(f_s)\\right) = \\max\\left(\\frac{D V_g^2 R_{\\max}}{2 f_s V_o^2}, \\frac{D V_g^2 R_{\\min}}{\\rho f_s V_o^2}\\right)\n$$\nThis can be simplified to:\n$$\nL \\ge \\frac{D V_g^2}{f_s V_o^2} \\max\\left(\\frac{R_{\\max}}{2}, \\frac{R_{\\min}}{\\rho}\\right)\n$$\nLet's evaluate the terms inside the $\\max$ function using the given values: $R_{\\min} = 50\\ \\Omega$, $R_{\\max} = 400\\ \\Omega$, and $\\rho = 0.25$.\n$$\n\\frac{R_{\\max}}{2} = \\frac{400}{2} = 200\\ \\Omega\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{R_{\\min}}{\\rho} = \\frac{50}{0.25} = 200\\ \\Omega\n$$\nThe two terms are equal. This indicates that the problem parameters were chosen such that satisfying one constraint precisely at its boundary implies the other constraint is also precisely satisfied at its boundary, for any given $f_s$. The two constraints are thus equivalent and collapse into a single condition:\n$$\nL \\ge \\frac{D V_g^2 (200)}{f_s V_o^2}\n$$\nThe objective is to find the pair $(L, f_s)$ that minimizes $L$. From the inequality above, $L$ is inversely proportional to $f_s$. To minimize $L$, we must therefore maximize $f_s$. The problem specifies an upper limit for the switching frequency, $f_{s,\\max} = 180\\ \\mathrm{kHz}$. Thus, the optimal switching frequency is $f_s = f_{s,\\max}$.\n\nThe optimal design is found by setting $f_s = f_{s,\\max} = 180\\ \\mathrm{kHz}$ and choosing the minimum possible value for $L$, which is the equality in the derived constraint.\n$$\nL_{\\min} = \\frac{D V_g^2 R_{\\max}}{2 f_{s,\\max} V_o^2}\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n- $D = 0.76$\n- $V_g = 48\\ \\mathrm{V}$\n- $V_o = 200\\ \\mathrm{V}$\n- $R_{\\max} = 400\\ \\Omega$\n- $f_{s,\\max} = 180 \\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{Hz}$\n\n$$\nL_{\\min} = \\frac{0.76 \\times (48)^2 \\times 400}{2 \\times (180 \\times 10^3) \\times (200)^2} = \\frac{0.76 \\times 2304 \\times 400}{360 \\times 10^3 \\times 40000} = \\frac{699392}{1.44 \\times 10^{10}}\\ \\mathrm{H}\n$$\n$$\nL_{\\min} = 48.568... \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{H} = 48.568...\\ \\mu\\mathrm{H}\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding to three significant figures.\n$L \\approx 48.6\\ \\mu\\mathrm{H}$.\nThe corresponding switching frequency is $f_s = 180\\ \\mathrm{kHz}$.\n\nThe final design values are $L = 48.6\\ \\mu\\mathrm{H}$ and $f_s = 180\\ \\mathrm{kHz}$.\nThe final answer should report $L$ in $\\mu\\mathrm{H}$ and $f_s$ in $\\mathrm{kHz}$.\n$L = 48.6$.\n$f_s = 180$.",
