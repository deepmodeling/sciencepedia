It describes a standard, idealized model of a buck converter, a fundamental topic in power electronics. The provided assumptions are standard for introductory analysis and lead to a well-defined problem. All necessary parameters are given, and there are no contradictions. The phenomena described adhere to the fundamental laws of electrical circuits, specifically the behavior of inductors. The numerical values are physically realistic for such a converter.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\nThe analysis begins with the fundamental voltage-current relationship for an inductor: $v_L(t) = L \\frac{\\mathrm{d}i_L(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}$. The operation of a buck converter is characterized by two states within one switching period, $T_{\\text{s}} = 1/f_{\\text{s}}$.\n\n1.  **State 1: MOSFET is ON, Diode is OFF (Duration $DT_{\\text{s}}$)**\n    During this interval, the input voltage is connected to the inductor. The voltage across the inductor is:\n    $$v_L = V_{\\text{in}} - V_{\\text{o}}$$\n    Since $V_{\\text{in}}$ and $V_{\\text{o}}$ are constant, the inductor current increases linearly.\n\n2.  **State 2: MOSFET is OFF, Diode is ON (Duration $(1-D)T_{\\text{s}}$)**\n    During this interval, the inductor is connected to ground through the diode. The voltage across the inductor is:\n    $$v_L = 0 - V_{\\text{o}} = -V_{\\text{o}}$$\n    The inductor current decreases linearly.\n\nIn steady-state operation, the principle of inductor volt-second balance dictates that the average voltage across the inductor over one full switching period must be zero.\n$$ \\frac{1}{T_{\\text{s}}} \\int_{0}^{T_{\\text{s}}} v_L(t) dt = 0 $$\nApplying this principle to the two states:\n$$ (V_{\\text{in}} - V_{\\text{o}}) \\cdot DT_{\\text{s}} + (-V_{\\text{o}}) \\cdot (1-D)T_{\\text{s}} = 0 $$\nDividing by $T_{\\text{s}}$:\n$$ D(V_{\\text{in}} - V_{\\text{o}}) - (1-D)V_{\\text{o}} = 0 $$\n$$ D V_{\\text{in}} - D V_{\\text{o}} - V_{\\text{o}} + D V_{\\text{o}} = 0 $$\n$$ D V_{\\text{in}} - V_{\\text{o}} = 0 $$\nThis yields the well-known voltage transfer ratio for an ideal buck converter:\n$$ V_{\\text{o}} = D V_{\\text{in}} $$\n\nNext, we derive the peak-to-peak inductor current ripple, $\\Delta i_{L,\\text{pp}}$. This ripple is the change in inductor current during either the ON or OFF interval. Using the ON interval:\n$$ \\Delta i_{L,\\text{pp}} = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_{0}^{DT_{\\text{s}}} v_L(t) dt = \\frac{1}{L} (V_{\\text{in}} - V_{\\text{o}}) (DT_{\\text{s}}) $$\nSubstitute $V_{\\text{o}} = D V_{\\text{in}}$ into the ripple equation:\n$$ \\Delta i_{L,\\text{pp}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{in}} - D V_{\\text{in}}}{L} DT_{\\text{s}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{in}}(1-D)}{L} DT_{\\text{s}} $$\nReplacing the switching period $T_{\\text{s}}$ with $1/f_{\\text{s}}$:\n$$ \\Delta i_{L,\\text{pp}} = \\frac{D(1-D)V_{\\text{in}}}{L f_{\\text{s}}} $$\nContinuous Conduction Mode (CCM) is defined by the condition that the inductor current $i_L(t)$ remains positive throughout the switching cycle. The minimum value of the inductor current is $i_{L,\\text{min}}$. The boundary between CCM and Discontinuous Conduction Mode (DCM) occurs when $i_{L,\\text{min}}$ just touches zero.\n\nThe inductor current waveform is triangular, centered on its average value, $I_L$. The minimum and maximum values are given by:\n$$ i_{L,\\text{min}} = I_L - \\frac{\\Delta i_{L,\\text{pp}}}{2} $$\n$$ i_{L,\\text{max}} = I_L + \\frac{\\Delta i_{L,\\text{pp}}}{2} $$\nThe boundary condition for CCM is $i_{L,\\text{min}} = 0$.

Due to the large capacitor assumption, the output voltage $v$ is considered constant over the period.\n\n1.  **Switch ON interval ($0 < t \\le DT$):**\n    The switch is closed, connecting the inductor to the input source. The voltage across the inductor is $v_L = V_g - v$. The inductor current starts at $i_L(0) = 0$ and ramps up linearly. The peak current $i_{L,\\text{peak}}$ reached at time $t=DT$ is:\n    $$i_{L,\\text{peak}} = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_0^{DT} (V_g - v) dt = \\frac{(V_g - v)DT}{L}$$\n\n2.  **Diode conduction interval ($DT < t \\le (D+D_2)T$):**\n    The switch is open, and the inductor current freewheels through the diode. The voltage across the inductor is $v_L = -v$. The current ramps down linearly from $i_{L,\\text{peak}}$ to zero over a duration of $D_2 T$.\n    The change in current is $-i_{L,\\text{peak}}$, so:\n    $$-i_{L,\\text{peak}} = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_{DT}^{(D+D_2)T} (-v) dt = \\frac{-v(D_2 T)}{L}$$\n    $$i_{L,\\text{peak}} = \\frac{v D_2 T}{L}$$\n\n3.  **Equating expressions for $i_{L,\\text{peak}}$:**\n    We equate the two expressions for the peak inductor current:\n    $$\\frac{(V_g - v)DT}{L} = \\frac{v D_2 T}{L}$$\n    $$(V_g - v)D = v D_2$$\n    Dividing by $v$ and rearranging gives an expression for $D_2$:\n    $$D_2 = D \\left(\\frac{V_g}{v} - 1\\right) = D \\left(\\frac{1}{M} - 1\\right) = \\frac{D(1-M)}{M}$$\n    Note that for DCM, we must have an idle interval, so $D + D_2 < 1$.\n\n4.  **Applying charge conservation:**\n    In steady state, the average current supplied by the inductor to the output stage must equal the average load current.\n    $$\\langle i_L \\rangle = I_{load} = \\frac{v}{R}$$\n    The inductor current waveform is a triangle with base $(D+D_2)T$ and height $i_{L,\\text{peak}}$, and is zero for the rest of the period. The average inductor current over a period $T$ is the area of this triangle divided by $T$:\n    $$\\langle i_L \\rangle = \\frac{1}{T} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\text{base} \\cdot \\text{height} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2T} [(D+D_2)T] i_{L,\\text{peak}} = \\frac{1}{2}(D+D_2)i_{L,\\text{peak}}$$\n    Equating this with the load current:\n    $$\\frac{v}{R} = \\frac{1}{2}(D+D_2)i_{L,\\text{peak}}$$\n    Now, substitute the expressions for $D_2$ and $i_{L,\\text{peak}}$. Using $i_{L,\\text{peak}} = v D_2 T / L$:\n    $$\\frac{v}{R} = \\frac{1}{2}(D+D_2) \\frac{v D_2 T}{L}$$\n    $$\\frac{1}{R} = \\frac{T}{2L}(D+D_2)D_2$$\n    Rearranging and using the definition $K = 2L/(RT)$:\n    $$K = (D+D_2)D_2$$\n    Now, substitute the expression for $D_2 = D(1-M)/M$:\n    $$K = \\left(D + \\frac{D(1-M)}{M}\\right) \\left(\\frac{D(1-M)}{M}\\right)$$\n    $$K = D\\left(1 + \\frac{1-M}{M}\\right) \\frac{D(1-M)}{M} = D\\left(\\frac{M+1-M}{M}\\right) \\frac{D(1-M)}{M}$$\n    $$K = D\\left(\\frac{1}{M}\\right) \\frac{D(1-M)}{M} = \\frac{D^2(1-M)}{M^2}$$\n    This is the governing relationship. To match the form in option A, we rearrange it:\n    $$K M^2 = D^2(1-M) = D^2 - D^2 M$$\n    $$K M^2 + D^2 M - D^2 = 0$$\n\n### Analysis of the Limit as $K \\to 0$\n\nWe are asked to find the limit of $M$ as $K \\to 0$ for a fixed duty cycle $D$.\n$$\\lim_{K\\to 0} (K M^2 + D^2 M - D^2) = 0$$\n$$(0) \\cdot M^2 + D^2 M - D^2 = 0$$\n$$D^2 M - D^2 = 0$$\n$$D^2(M-1) = 0$$\nSince the problem states $0 < D < 1$, $D^2$ is non-zero. Therefore, we must have:\n$$M - 1 = 0 \\implies M = 1$$\nSo, as $K \\to 0$, $M \\to 1$. This means the output voltage $v$ approaches the input voltage $V_g$.\n\n### Physical Interpretation\n\nThe parameter $K = 2L/(RT)$. For fixed $L$ and $T$, the limit $K \\to 0$ corresponds to the load resistance $R \\to \\infty$. This is the very light load or no-load condition.\nAs $R \\to \\infty$, the average load current $I_{load} = v/R \\to 0$.\nSince $\\langle i_L \\rangle = I_{load}$, the average inductor current must also approach zero.\nThe consequence on the internal variables is:\n-   Output voltage: $v = M V_g \\to (1)V_g = V_g$.\n-   Peak inductor current: $i_{L,\\text{peak}} = (V_g - v)DT/L \\to (V_g - V_g)DT/L = 0$.\n-   Diode conduction fraction: $D_2 = D(1-M)/M \\to D(1-1)/1 = 0$.\nPhysically, as the load becomes infinitely light, the output capacitor barely discharges between switching cycles. It requires a vanishingly small amount of charge replenishment to maintain its voltage. When the switch turns on, the output voltage $v$ is already very close to the input voltage $V_g$. This results in a tiny inductor voltage $(V_g - v)$, which in turn creates a tiny peak inductor current $i_{L,\\text{peak}}$. This tiny current is just enough to replenish the capacitor's minimal charge loss. When the switch turns off, this tiny peak current decays to zero in a very short time ($D_2 T \\to 0$). The output capacitor voltage, being \"topped off\" to near $V_g$ in each cycle and having no significant discharge path, settles at a DC value $v \\approx V_g$.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. In DCM for an ideal buck converter, the normalized conversion ratio obeys $K M^2 + D^2 M - D^2 = 0$, so for fixed $D$ and $K \\to 0$ one has $M \\to 1$. Physically, as the load lightens ($R \\to \\infty$ so $K \\to 0$), the capacitor requires negligible replenishment per cycle; the inductor peak current and the diode-conduction interval collapse, and the output node is effectively held near $V_g$ during the on-interval, hence $v \\to V_g$ even with $D<1$.**\n- The derived equation $K M^2 + D^2 M - D^2 = 0$ matches.\n- The calculated limit $M \\to 1$ as $K \\to 0$ matches.\n- The physical explanation is entirely consistent with the derivation: light load ($R \\to \\infty$) means negligible capacitor discharge, which requires only a minuscule inductor current pulse to maintain voltage. This leads to the collapse of the diode-conduction interval ($D_2 \\to 0$) and the output voltage settling at the peak charging voltage, $V_g$.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. In DCM for an ideal buck converter, the normalized conversion ratio always remains $M = D$ for any $K$, because volt-second balance holds over the full period regardless of conduction mode; therefore, for fixed $D$ and $K \\to 0$, $M \\to D$.**\n- The relation $M=D$ is for continuous conduction mode (CCM), not DCM. In DCM, the relationship is the more complex one derived above. From $K = D^2(1-M)/M^2$, it's clear that $M$ is a function of $K$ and is not constant.\n- For any $K > 0$ in DCM, we have $D^2(1-M)/M^2 > 0$, which implies $1-M>0$, or $M<1$. Also, from $D_2 > 0$, we have $D(1-M)/M > 0$, which again implies $M<1$. From the volt-second balance relation $M = D/(D+D_2)$ and the DCM condition $D+D_2 < 1$, we can deduce $M > D$. So in DCM, $D < M < 1$. The claim $M=D$ is false.\n- The limit $M \\to D$ is therefore incorrect; the limit is $M \\to 1$.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. In DCM for an ideal buck converter, as $K \\to 0$ with fixed $D$, the output collapses with $M \\to 0$, because vanishing inductor current implies no energy transfer to the capacitor.**\n- The calculated limit is $M \\to 1$, not $M \\to 0$. The conclusion is false.\n- The physical reasoning is flawed. Vanishing inductor current corresponds to vanishing load power dissipation. The capacitor voltage is maintained, not collapsed, because the energy delivered (though vanishingly small) perfectly matches the energy consumed by the load (which is also vanishingly small).\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. In DCM for an ideal buck converter, as $K \\to 0$ with fixed $D$, the diode-conduction fraction $D_2$ grows without bound and $M \\to 1/D$ due to increasing inductor peak currents at light load.**\n- As shown in the derivation, as $K \\to 0$, $M \\to 1$, which causes $D_2 = D(1-M)/M \\to 0$. $D_2$ does not grow, it collapses.\n- The inductor peak current also approaches zero, it does not increase.\n- The limit $M \\to 1/D$ is incorrect (note that for $D<1$, $1/D > 1$, which would imply a step-up action, impossible for a buck converter).\n- All parts of this statement are factually wrong.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

In CCM, the buck converter is minimum phase: a small positive duty perturbation $\\hat{d}>0$ immediately increases the average inductor voltage during the ON subinterval, producing a positive $\\mathrm{d}i_{L}/\\mathrm{d}t$ in the same switching cycle and thus increasing the inductor current delivered to the output. The initial tendency of $\\hat{v}_{\\text{o}}(t)$ is not opposite to its steady-state change, so no Right-Half-Plane Zero (RHPZ) exists; any zero originates from the capacitor ESR and lies in the Left Half-Plane (LHP).\n\nB. In CCM, the buck converter has a RHPZ like a boost converter: a small positive duty perturbation $\\hat{d}>0$ initially starves the output of energy because the inductor must first build current that cannot reach the load until the subsequent cycle, so the output initially moves opposite to its final direction.\n\nC. Whether a RHPZ appears in the buck depends on the outer-loop control method: under current-mode control the RHPZ vanishes, while under voltage-mode control the RHPZ appears due to duty-to-inductor-current coupling.\n\nD. The buck converter in CCM does have a RHPZ, but it is exactly canceled by a Left-Half-Plane zero introduced by the output capacitor dynamics, so it is unobservable in practice.\n\nE. The absence of a RHPZ in a buck requires Discontinuous Conduction Mode (DCM); in CCM a RHPZ appears because capacitor charge balance forces an initial output deviation opposite to the final direction after a duty step.",
            "solution": "The user wants a critical analysis of the small-signal control-to-output dynamics of an ideal buck converter operating in Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM), specifically concerning the existence of a Right-Half-Plane Zero (RHPZ).\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe problem provides the following information and constraints:\n- **System:** An ideal step-down buck converter.\n- **Operating Mode:** Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM), with inductor current $I_{L}$ strictly positive at all times.\n- **Input:** A stiff input source of voltage $V_{\\text{g}}$.\n- **Components:** Inductor $L$, output capacitor $C$ with Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR) $r_{\\text{c}} \\ge 0$, and resistive load $R$.\n- **Control:** Duty ratio $D \\in (0,1)$ at a fixed switching period $T_{\\text{s}}$.\n- **Initial State:** Steady operating point with output voltage $V_{\\text{o}}$ and inductor current $I_{L}$.\n- **Assumptions:** Ideal switching and diode behavior.\n- **Analysis Method:** Use only the inductor law $v_{L} = L \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{d}i_{L}}{\\mathrm{d}t}$, the capacitor law $i_{C} = C \\, \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{C}}{\\mathrm{d}t}$, state partitioning, and duty-cycle averaging.\n- **Objective:** Reason about the small-signal dynamics from duty-cycle perturbation $\\hat{d}(t)$ to output voltage perturbation $\\hat{v}_{\\text{o}}(t)$.\n- **Key Concept:** A RHPZ is defined as causing a nonminimum-phase effect, where the initial response to a step input is of opposite sign to the final steady-state change.\n- **Question:** Select the most accurate statement regarding the existence of a RHPZ in a CCM buck converter, using energy-flow and small-signal reasoning.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is critically evaluated for validity.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem describes a canonical buck converter circuit and proposes analyzing its small-signal transfer function. This is a fundamental and standard topic in power electronics and control theory. The principles cited ($v_L = L \\frac{\\mathrm{d}i_L}{\\mathrm{d}t}$, state-space averaging) are the correct tools for this analysis. The definition of a nonminimum-phase response due to a RHPZ is accurate. The problem is firmly rooted in established electrical engineering principles.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides sufficient information (topology, operating mode, components) to perform the requested conceptual analysis. It asks for a qualitative conclusion (presence/absence of RHPZ) based on physical reasoning, which has a definite and unique answer within the standard model.\n- **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\nThe problem statement does not violate any of the invalidity criteria:\n1.  **Scientific Unsoundness:** The premises are factually correct within the context of ideal converter modeling.\n2.  **Non-Formalizable:** The problem is perfectly formalizable into a state-space model and transfer function.\n3.  **Incomplete/Contradictory:** The setup is complete for the requested level of analysis.\n4.  **Unrealistic:** The model is an idealization, but it is a standard and useful one in power electronics education and analysis.\n5.  **Ill-Posed:** A unique conceptual answer exists.\n6.  **Trivial/Tautological:** The difference in dynamic behavior between converter topologies (e.g., buck vs. boost) is a non-trivial concept.\n7.  **Outside Verifiability:** The result is verifiable through both mathematical derivation and physical simulation/experiment.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **VALID**. I will proceed with the derivation and analysis.\n\n### Principle-Based Derivation\nThe core of the question is to determine the initial response of the output voltage $\\hat{v}_{\\text{o}}(t)$ to a small positive step perturbation in the duty cycle, $\\hat{d}(t) = \\Delta d \\cdot u(t)$ where $\\Delta d > 0$.\n\nIn steady-state CCM, the average output voltage is given by $V_{\\text{o}} = D V_{\\text{g}}$. A positive step in duty cycle to a new value $D' = D + \\Delta d$ will result in a new, higher steady-state output voltage $V'_{\\text{o}} = (D + \\Delta d)V_{\\text{g}}$. Thus, the final change in output voltage is positive. A RHPZ would exist if the *initial* response of $v_{\\text{o}}(t)$ is negative.\n\nLet us analyze the energy flow and circuit behavior immediately following the perturbation, using the state-space averaging concept requested. The averaged state equations for the buck converter are:\n1.  Average inductor voltage: $\\langle v_L \\rangle = L \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\langle i_L \\rangle}{\\mathrm{d}t}$\n2.  Average capacitor current: $\\langle i_C \\rangle = C \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\langle v_C \\rangle}{\\mathrm{d}t}$\n\nThe average inductor voltage over one switching period $T_s$ is found by weighting the voltages in the ON and OFF subintervals:\n$$ \\langle v_L \\rangle = D(V_{\\text{g}} - V_{\\text{o}}) + (1-D)(-V_{\\text{o}}) = D V_{\\text{g}} - V_{\\text{o}} $$\nIn steady state, $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\langle i_L \\rangle}{\\mathrm{d}t} = 0$, so $\\langle v_L \\rangle = 0$, which gives the familiar result $V_{\\text{o}} = D V_{\\text{g}}$.\n\nNow, consider a small perturbation $\\hat{d}$ to the duty cycle $D$. The total duty cycle becomes $d = D + \\hat{d}$. The state variables and output voltage also have small perturbations: $i_L = I_L + \\hat{i}_L$, $v_C = V_C + \\hat{v}_C$, and $v_{\\text{o}} = V_{\\text{o}} + \\hat{v}_{\\text{o}}$. The linearized equation for the average inductor voltage dynamics becomes:\n$$ L \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\hat{i}_L}{\\mathrm{d}t} = (D+\\hat{d})V_{\\text{g}} - (V_{\\text{o}}+\\hat{v}_{\\text{o}}) = (DV_{\\text{g}} - V_{\\text{o}}) + \\hat{d}V_{\\text{g}} - \\hat{v}_{\\text{o}} $$\nSince $DV_{\\text{g}} - V_{\\text{o}} = 0$ at the operating point, this simplifies to:\n$$ L \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\hat{i}_L}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\hat{d}V_{\\text{g}} - \\hat{v}_{\\text{o}} $$\nWhen a positive step $\\hat{d}$ is applied, and assuming $\\hat{v}_{\\text{o}}$ has not yet had time to change significantly, the term $\\hat{d}V_{\\text{g}}$ is a positive forcing function. This creates a positive rate of change in the average inductor current, $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\hat{i}_L}{\\mathrm{d}t} > 0$.\n\nCrucially for the buck converter, the inductor is *always* connected to the output stage (the parallel combination of the capacitor $C$ and load $R$). The inductor current $i_L$ is the source of current for this output stage. An increasing inductor current $\\hat{i}_L$ will flow into the output node. This current splits between the capacitor ($i_C$) and the load ($i_R = v_{\\text{o}}/R$):\n$$ \\hat{i}_L = \\hat{i}_C + \\hat{i}_R = C\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\hat{v}_C}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{\\hat{v}_{\\text{o}}}{R} $$\nAs $\\hat{i}_L$ begins to increase, this additional current must go somewhere. Part of it will charge the capacitor (increasing $\\hat{v}_C$) and part will flow through the load (increasing $\\hat{v}_{\\text{o}}$). The output voltage is $v_{\\text{o}} = v_C + i_C r_{\\text{c}}$. An increase in capacitor charging current or capacitor voltage will lead to an increase in output voltage.\n\nThe energy flow argument is direct: increasing the duty cycle in a buck converter increases the duration for which the input source $V_{\\text{g}}$ is connected to the inductor. Since the inductor is directly feeding the output, this immediately increases the power flow to the output stage. There is no intermediate \"starvation\" of the output, which is the characteristic mechanism of RHPZ in converters like the boost or buck-boost. The initial response $\\hat{v}_{\\text{o}}(t)$ is therefore in the same direction (positive) as the final steady-state change. This indicates a **minimum-phase** response, and thus **no RHPZ**.\n\nTo confirm and identify any zero, we can write the full small-signal output voltage equation:\n$$ \\hat{v}_{\\text{o}}(s) = \\hat{v}_C(s) + r_{\\text{c}} \\hat{i}_C(s) = \\hat{v}_C(s) + r_{\\text{c}} (s C \\hat{v}_C(s)) = (1 + sCr_{\\text{c}})\\hat{v}_C(s) $$\nThe control-to-output transfer function $G_{v_{\\text{o}}d}(s) = \\hat{v}_{\\text{o}}(s) / \\hat{d}(s)$ is therefore:\n$$ G_{v_{\\text{o}}d}(s) = \\frac{\\hat{v}_{\\text{o}}(s)}{\\hat{d}(s)} = (1 + sCr_{\\text{c}}) \\frac{\\hat{v}_C(s)}{\\hat{d}(s)} $$\nThe transfer function has a zero at $s = -1/(Cr_{\\text{c}})$. Since $C > 0$ and the ESR $r_{\\text{c}} \\ge 0$, this zero lies in the Left-Half Plane (if $r_{\\text{c}} > 0$) or at infinity (if $r_{\\text{c}}=0$). It is never in the Right-Half Plane.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n- **A. In CCM, the buck converter is minimum phase: a small positive duty perturbation $\\hat{d}>0$ immediately increases the average inductor voltage during the ON subinterval, producing a positive $\\mathrm{d}i_{L}/\\mathrm{d}t$ in the same switching cycle and thus increasing the inductor current delivered to the output. The initial tendency of $\\hat{v}_{\\text{o}}(t)$ is not opposite to its steady-state change, so no Right-Half-Plane Zero (RHPZ) exists; any zero originates from the capacitor ESR and lies in the Left Half-Plane (LHP).**\n  - This statement accurately describes the buck converter as minimum-phase. The physical reasoning is correct: a positive $\\hat{d}$ increases the average inductor voltage, leading to an increasing inductor current that is delivered directly to the output stage, causing the output voltage to rise. This matches our derivation. The statement correctly identifies the ESR as the source of the LHP zero.\n  - **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n- **B. In CCM, the buck converter has a RHPZ like a boost converter: a small positive duty perturbation $\\hat{d}>0$ initially starves the output of energy because the inductor must first build current that cannot reach the load until the subsequent cycle, so the output initially moves opposite to its final direction.**\n  - This statement is factually incorrect. The reasoning provided describes the behavior of a boost or buck-boost converter, where increasing the duty cycle disconnects the inductor from the load for a longer time, starving the output. In a buck converter, the inductor is never disconnected from the load stage.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **C. Whether a RHPZ appears in the buck depends on the outer-loop control method: under current-mode control the RHPZ vanishes, while under voltage-mode control the RHPZ appears due to duty-to-inductor-current coupling.**\n  - The presence or absence of a RHPZ is an intrinsic characteristic of the power stage topology (the \"plant\") in its open-loop form, $G_{v_{\\text{o}}d}(s) = \\hat{v}_{\\text{o}}(s) / \\hat{d}(s)$. It does not depend on the type of feedback control (voltage-mode or current-mode) applied around it. The controller can alter the closed-loop poles, but not the open-loop plant's zeros. Furthermore, the premise that a RHPZ appears under voltage-mode control is false.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **D. The buck converter in CCM does have a RHPZ, but it is exactly canceled by a Left-Half-Plane zero introduced by the output capacitor dynamics, so it is unobservable in practice.**\n  - This is incorrect on multiple grounds. First, as derived, the buck converter does not have a RHPZ. Second, a RHP zero at $s=z_0$ ($z_0>0$) cannot be \"canceled\" by a LHP zero at $s=-z_1$ ($z_1>0$). Such a pole-zero cancellation is mathematically impossible unless the system is unstable in a very specific way not relevant here.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n- **E. The absence of a RHPZ in a buck requires Discontinuous Conduction Mode (DCM); in CCM a RHPZ appears because capacitor charge balance forces an initial output deviation opposite to the final direction after a duty step.**\n  - This statement is false. The buck converter is minimum-phase (has no RHPZ) in both CCM and DCM. The claim that a RHPZ appears in CCM is the central error, and the reasoning is unsubstantiated and contrary to the energy-flow analysis.\n  - **Verdict: Incorrect.**",
