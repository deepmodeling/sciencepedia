            "problem": "An isolated flyback converter operates under idealized conditions: zero leakage inductance, lossless switch and diode, and an ideal transformer with primary turns $N_{p}$ and secondary turns $N_{s}$. Let the turns ratio be defined as $n = N_{p}/N_{s}$. The magnetizing inductance $L_{m}$ is connected across the primary, the input source provides a constant voltage $V_{in}$, and a large output capacitance holds the output voltage approximately constant within each switching period. The switching action is periodic with period $T$ and duty cycle $D$, where the primary-side switch is closed for $D T$ and open for $(1-D) T$. Assume operation in Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM), meaning the magnetizing current never reaches zero within a period.\n\nStarting from Faraday’s law for the magnetizing inductance and the ideal transformer relation, impose periodic steady-state (zero net change in magnetizing current over one period) to derive the steady-state output voltage $V_{o}$ as a function of $V_{in}$, $n$, and $D$ in CCM. Then, interpret the derived expression to identify the boundary condition on $D$ that prevents non-physical solutions, and verify that the given operating point satisfies it.\n\nUse the following numerical values: $V_{in} = 300\\,\\mathrm{V}$, $n = 7.5$, and $D = \\frac{3}{8}$. Compute $V_{o}$ for this operating point in volts. Round your final numerical answer to four significant figures and express it in $\\mathrm{V}$.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is assessed to be valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in power electronics that is free from ambiguity, contradiction, and factual error. We may proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe steady-state output voltage $V_{o}$ of the flyback converter can be determined by applying the principle of volt-second balance to the magnetizing inductance $L_{m}$. This principle, derived from Faraday's law of induction ($v_L = L \\frac{di_L}{dt}$), states that for an inductor operating in a periodic steady state, the net change in its current over one full switching period $T$ is zero. This implies that the average voltage across the inductor over one period must be zero.\n$$\n\\langle v_{L_{m}} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} v_{L_{m}}(t) \\, dt = 0\n$$\nTo apply this principle, we analyze the circuit in its two operating states during a switching period.\n\n1.  **State 1: Switch is ON ($0 \\le t  DT$)**\n    When the primary-side switch is closed, the input voltage source $V_{in}$ is connected directly across the primary winding of the ideal transformer. Since the magnetizing inductance $L_{m}$ is modeled as being in parallel with the primary winding, the voltage across it is equal to the input voltage.\n    $$\n    v_{L_{m}}(t) = V_{in} \\quad \\text{for } 0 \\le t  DT\n    $$\n    During this interval, energy from the source is stored in the magnetic field of the inductor, and the magnetizing current increases. On the secondary side, the voltage induced would reverse-bias the diode, so no current flows to the output. The output capacitor supplies the load.\n\n2.  **State 2: Switch is OFF ($DT \\le t  T$)**\n    When the primary-side switch is opened, the current path on the primary side is interrupted. The energy stored in the magnetizing inductance causes the current to continue flowing. This magnetizing current is transferred to the secondary winding. The current $i_{s}(t)$ flows through the secondary winding, forward-biasing the ideal diode. With the diode conducting, the voltage across the secondary winding is clamped to the negative of the output voltage, $v_{s} = -V_{o}$. The polarity is negative due to the winding configuration in a flyback converter, which ensures the diode is forward-biased only when the switch is open. Using the ideal transformer voltage relationship, this voltage is reflected to the primary side.\n    $$\n    v_{p}(t) = \\frac{N_{p}}{N_{s}} v_{s}(t) = n (-V_{o}) = -n V_{o}\n    $$\n    The voltage across the magnetizing inductance is equal to this primary voltage.\n    $$\n    v_{L_{m}}(t) = -n V_{o} \\quad \\text{for } DT \\le t  T\n    $$\n    During this interval, the energy stored in the inductor is transferred to the output capacitor and the load, and the magnetizing current decreases.\n\nNow, we apply the volt-second balance condition by integrating the voltage across $L_{m}$ over the full period $T$ and setting the result to zero.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T} v_{L_{m}}(t) \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{DT} V_{in} \\, dt + \\int_{DT}^{T} (-n V_{o}) \\, dt = 0\n$$\nEvaluating the integrals:\n$$\nV_{in} [t]_{0}^{DT} - n V_{o} [t]_{DT}^{T} = 0\n$$\n$$\nV_{in} (DT) - n V_{o} (T - DT) = 0\n$$\nThe switching period $T$ is non-zero and can be factored out.\n$$\nV_{in} D - n V_{o} (1 - D) = 0\n$$\nRearranging this equation to solve for the output voltage $V_{o}$ as a function of $V_{in}$, $n$, and $D$:\n$$\nn V_{o} (1 - D) = V_{in} D\n$$\n$$\nV_{o} = V_{in} \\frac{D}{n(1-D)}\n$$\nThis is the steady-state voltage transfer ratio for an ideal flyback converter operating in Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM).\n\nNext, we must interpret this expression to identify the boundary condition on the duty cycle $D$ that prevents non-physical solutions. The duty cycle $D$ is defined as a fraction of the period, so its domain is $0 \\le D \\le 1$.\nFor the output voltage $V_{o}$ to be a finite, positive physical quantity (given $V_{in}  0$ and $n  0$), the term $\\frac{D}{1-D}$ must be finite and non-negative.\n-   If $D=0$, then $V_{o}=0$.\n-   If $0  D  1$, then $1-D  0$ and $V_{o}  0$, which is a physically valid operating range.\n-   If $D \\to 1^{-}$, then $1-D \\to 0^{+}$, and $V_{o} \\to \\infty$. An infinite output voltage is non-physical. It implies that for a duty cycle of $1$, the switch is always closed, and energy is continually stored in the inductor without any time for it to be transferred to the output. This would cause the magnetizing current to ramp up indefinitely, violating the steady-state assumption.\nTherefore, the necessary condition for a physically meaningful steady-state solution is $0 \\le D  1$. For any non-zero power transfer, $D$ must be strictly greater than $0$.\nThe given operating point is $D = \\frac{3}{8}$. Since $0  \\frac{3}{8}  1$, this operating point satisfies the physical constraint.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of $V_{o}$ using the given values: $V_{in} = 300\\,\\mathrm{V}$, $n = 7.5$, and $D = \\frac{3}{8}$.\nFirst, calculate $1-D$:\n$$\n1 - D = 1 - \\frac{3}{8} = \\frac{5}{8}\n$$\nNow substitute all values into the derived equation for $V_{o}$:\n$$\nV_{o} = (300\\,\\mathrm{V}) \\frac{\\frac{3}{8}}{(7.5)\\left(\\frac{5}{8}\\right)}\n$$\n$$\nV_{o} = 300 \\cdot \\frac{3/8}{37.5/8} = 300 \\cdot \\frac{3}{37.5}\n$$\n$$\nV_{o} = 300 \\cdot \\frac{3}{75/2} = 300 \\cdot \\frac{6}{75}\n$$\nSince $300 = 4 \\times 75$:\n$$\nV_{o} = 4 \\times 75 \\cdot \\frac{6}{75} = 4 \\times 6 = 24\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $24\\,\\mathrm{V}$. To express this with four significant figures, we write it as $24.00\\,\\mathrm{V}$.",

It contains no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n---\n\nThe solution will be developed by following the three tasks specified in the problem statement. The switching period is $T = 1/f_s = 1/(100 \\times 10^3 \\text{ Hz}) = 10^{-5} \\text{ s}$.\n\n### 1. Computation of the Boundary-Conduction Duty Cycle, $D_{\\text{bc}}$\n\nThe duty cycle at the boundary of CCM and DCM, denoted $D_{\\text{bc}}$, is computed by analyzing the magnetizing current $i_m(t)$ over one switching period.\n\nDuring the first subinterval, when the primary switch is ON for a duration $DT$, the input voltage $V_{in}$ is applied across the magnetizing inductance $L_m$. The magnetizing current ramps up linearly. Using the inductor voltage-current relation $v_{L_m} = L_m \\frac{di_m}{dt}$, the change in current is:\n$$ \\Delta i_{m, \\text{rise}} = \\frac{V_{in}}{L_m} (D_{\\text{bc}}T) $$\nSince operation is at the boundary, the current starts from zero at the beginning of the cycle. Therefore, the peak magnetizing current, $I_{m,pk}$, is equal to this rise:\n$$ I_{m,pk} = \\frac{V_{in} D_{\\text{bc}} T}{L_m} $$\n\nDuring the second subinterval, the switch is OFF for a duration $(1 - D_{\\text{bc}})T$. The secondary diode conducts, clamping the secondary voltage to $V_o$. This voltage, when reflected to the primary side, imposes a voltage of $-n V_o$ across the magnetizing inductance. The magnetizing current ramps down. The change in current during this fall is:\n$$ \\Delta i_{m, \\text{fall}} = \\frac{n V_o}{L_m} t_d $$\nwhere $t_d$ is the duration of the current fall (i.e., the diode conduction time).\n\nThe problem states that at the boundary, the current decays to zero exactly at the end of the off-time, which means $t_d = (1 - D_{\\text{bc}})T$. The magnitude of the current fall must equal the peak current $I_{m,pk}$ reached during the ON time.\n$$ I_{m,pk} = \\frac{n V_o}{L_m} (1 - D_{\\text{bc}})T $$\n\nEquating the two expressions for $I_{m,pk}$:\n$$ \\frac{V_{in} D_{\\text{bc}} T}{L_m} = \\frac{n V_o (1 - D_{\\text{bc}}) T}{L_m} $$\nThe terms $T$ and $L_m$ cancel out, leading to:\n$$ V_{in} D_{\\text{bc}} = n V_o (1 - D_{\\text{bc}}) $$\n$$ V_{in} D_{\\text{bc}} = n V_o - n V_o D_{\\text{bc}} $$\n$$ D_{\\text{bc}} (V_{in} + n V_o) = n V_o $$\n$$ D_{\\text{bc}} = \\frac{n V_o}{V_{in} + n V_o} $$\n\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$ D_{\\text{bc}} = \\frac{3 \\times 12}{60 + (3 \\times 12)} = \\frac{36}{60 + 36} = \\frac{36}{96} $$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $12$ gives:\n$$ D_{\\text{bc}} = \\frac{3}{8} = 0.375 $$\n\n### 2. Consistency with CCM Volt-Second Balance\n\nThe principle of volt-second balance for an inductor states that in steady-state operation, the net volt-seconds applied across the inductor over one switching period must be zero. This means the time integral of the voltage across $L_m$ over one period $T$ is zero.\n$$ \\int_{0}^{T} v_{L_m}(t) dt = 0 $$\nDuring the ON time ($0 \\le t \\le DT$), $v_{L_m}(t) = V_{in}$. During the OFF time ($DT  t \\le T$), the secondary diode conducts, and $v_{L_m}(t) = -n V_o$. In general CCM, the diode conducts for a time $t_d  (1-D)T$. However, the standard derivation of the CCM voltage transfer ratio operates on the assumption that the diode conducts for the entire duration of the off-time, i.e., $t_d = (1-D)T$. This assumption is only strictly exact at the CCM/DCM boundary.\n\nApplying volt-second balance under this boundary condition:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{D_{\\text{bc}}T} V_{in} dt + \\int_{D_{\\text{bc}}T}^{T} (-n V_o) dt = 0 $$\n$$ V_{in} (D_{\\text{bc}}T) - n V_o (T - D_{\\text{bc}}T) = 0 $$\n$$ V_{in} D_{\\text{bc}} T = n V_o (1 - D_{\\text{bc}}) T $$\nCanceling $T$:\n$$ V_{in} D_{\\text{bc}} = n V_o (1 - D_{\\text{bc}}) $$\nThis is the identical algebraic equation derived in Part 1 from current rise/fall dynamics. Solving it yields the same result, $D_{\\text{bc}} = \\frac{n V_o}{V_{in} + n V_o} = 0.375$. This demonstrates that the duty cycle computed from first principles is consistent with the one obtained from applying the volt-second balance principle under the boundary condition.\n\n### 3. Confirmation with Energy Transfer and Output Power\n\nThis part verifies that the energy transferred per cycle matches the energy required by the load.\n\nFirst, the required output power $P_o$ and the energy per cycle $E_{\\text{req}}$ are calculated:\n$$ P_o = \\frac{V_o^2}{R} = \\frac{(12 \\text{ V})^2}{\\frac{256}{15} \\text{ } \\Omega} = \\frac{144 \\times 15}{256} \\text{ W} = \\frac{9 \\times 16 \\times 15}{16 \\times 16} \\text{ W} = \\frac{135}{16} \\text{ W} = 8.4375 \\text{ W} $$\n$$ E_{\\text{req}} = P_o T = (8.4375 \\text{ W}) \\times (10^{-5} \\text{ s}) = 8.4375 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ J} $$\n\nNext, the energy transferred by the converter per cycle, $E_{\\text{trans}}$, is calculated. At the DCM boundary, the energy stored in the magnetizing inductance at the end of the ON time is completely transferred to the load during the OFF time.\n$$ E_{\\text{trans}} = \\frac{1}{2} L_m I_{m,pk}^2 $$\nThe peak current $I_{m,pk}$ is first calculated using the duty cycle $D_{\\text{bc}} = 0.375$:\n$$ I_{m,pk} = \\frac{V_{in} D_{\\text{bc}} T}{L_m} = \\frac{(60 \\text{ V}) \\times 0.375 \\times (10^{-5} \\text{ s})}{300 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ H}} $$\n$$ I_{m,pk} = \\frac{60 \\times 0.375}{30} \\text{ A} = 2 \\times 0.375 \\text{ A} = 0.75 \\text{ A} $$\nNow, the transferred energy can be computed:\n$$ E_{\\text{trans}} = \\frac{1}{2} (300 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ H}) \\times (0.75 \\text{ A})^2 = \\frac{1}{2} (3 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times (\\frac{3}{4})^2 \\text{ J} $$\n$$ E_{\\text{trans}} = \\frac{1}{2} (3 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times \\frac{9}{16} \\text{ J} = \\frac{27}{32} \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ J} $$\n$$ E_{\\text{trans}} = 0.84375 \\times 10^{-4} \\text{ J} = 8.4375 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ J} $$\n\nComparing the required and transferred energies:\n$$ E_{\\text{req}} = 8.4375 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ J} $$\n$$ E_{\\text{trans}} = 8.4375 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ J} $$\nSince $E_{\\text{trans}} = E_{\\text{req}}$, the analysis is self-consistent. The computed duty cycle $D_{\\text{bc}} = 0.375$ correctly corresponds to the operating point where the converter provides the required power to the load precisely at the CCM-DCM boundary.\n\nThe final answer is the duty cycle $D_{\\text{bc}}$ rounded to four significant figures.\n$D_{\\text{bc}} = 0.3750$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the duty cycle excursion, $\\Delta D_{\\max}$, for an ideal flyback converter as its input voltage drops from a nominal value, $V_{\\text{in,nom}}$, to a dipped value, $V_{\\text{in,dip}}$. A crucial part of the analysis is to determine the converter's conduction mode—continuous conduction mode (CCM) or discontinuous conduction mode (DCM)—at each input voltage, as the governing equations for the duty cycle depend on the mode of operation.\n\nFirst, we derive the voltage transfer ratio for a flyback converter assuming it operates in CCM. In steady state, the volt-second product across the magnetizing inductance, $L_{\\text{m}}$, must balance over one switching period, $T_{\\text{s}}$. During the switch-on interval of duration $D T_{\\text{s}}$, the voltage across the primary is the input voltage, $V_{\\text{in}}$. During the switch-off interval, the secondary diode conducts, and the output voltage, $V_{\\text{out}}$, is reflected across the primary, scaled by the turns ratio $N_{\\text{p}}/N_{\\text{s}}$. In CCM, the secondary diode conducts for the entire duration of the off-interval, $(1-D)T_{\\text{s}}$. The voltage across the primary during this time is $-V_{\\text{out}}(N_{\\text{p}}/N_{\\text{s}})$.\n\nThe volt-second balance equation is:\n$$V_{\\text{in}} (D T_{\\text{s}}) + \\left(-V_{\\text{out}} \\frac{N_{\\text{p}}}{N_{\\text{s}}}\\right) (1-D) T_{\\text{s}} = 0$$\nDividing by $T_{\\text{s}}$ and rearranging for the duty cycle $D$:\n$$V_{\\text{in}} D = V_{\\text{out}} \\frac{N_{\\text{p}}}{N_{\\text{s}}} (1-D)$$\n$$D \\left(V_{\\text{in}} + V_{\\text{out}} \\frac{N_{\\text{p}}}{N_{\\text{s}}}\\right) = V_{\\text{out}} \\frac{N_{\\text{p}}}{N_{\\text{s}}}$$\n$$D_{\\text{CCM}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{out}} \\frac{N_{\\text{p}}}{N_{\\text{s}}}}{V_{\\text{in}} + V_{\\text{out}} \\frac{N_{\\text{p}}}{N_{\\text{s}}}}$$\n\nLet us define the reflected output voltage as $V_{\\text{R}} = V_{\\text{out}} \\frac{N_{\\text{p}}}{N_{\\text{s}}}$. Using the given values:\n$$V_{\\text{R}} = 12\\,\\mathrm{V} \\times 4 = 48\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nThe duty cycle expression simplifies to $D_{\\text{CCM}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{R}}}{V_{\\text{in}} + V_{\\text{R}}}$.\n\nNow, we calculate the duty cycle under the CCM assumption for both input voltage conditions.\nFor the nominal input voltage, $V_{\\text{in,nom}} = 36\\,\\mathrm{V}$:\n$$D_{\\text{nom,CCM}} = \\frac{48}{36 + 48} = \\frac{48}{84} = \\frac{4}{7}$$\nFor the dipped input voltage, $V_{\\text{in,dip}} = 18\\,\\mathrm{V}$:\n$$D_{\\text{dip,CCM}} = \\frac{48}{18 + 48} = \\frac{48}{66} = \\frac{8}{11}$$\n\nNext, we must validate this CCM assumption. The converter operates in CCM if the output power, $P_{\\text{out}}$, is greater than the critical power at the CCM-DCM boundary, $P_{\\text{out,B}}$. The boundary condition occurs when the magnetizing current just reaches zero at the end of the switching cycle. At this boundary, the power transferred is given by $P_{\\text{out,B}} = E_{\\text{peak}} f_{\\text{s}}$, where $E_{\\text{peak}}$ is the peak energy stored in the magnetizing inductance.\n$$E_{\\text{peak}} = \\frac{1}{2} L_{\\text{m}} i_{\\text{m,peak}}^2$$\nThe peak magnetizing current, $i_{\\text{m,peak}}$, at the end of the on-time is:\n$$i_{\\text{m,peak}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{in}} D_{\\text{CCM}} T_{\\text{s}}}{L_{\\text{m}}}$$\nSubstituting this into the power equation:\n$$P_{\\text{out,B}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} L_{\\text{m}} \\left(\\frac{V_{\\text{in}} D_{\\text{CCM}} T_{\\text{s}}}{L_{\\text{m}}}\\right)^2\\right) f_{\\text{s}} = \\frac{1}{2} L_{\\text{m}} \\frac{V_{\\text{in}}^2 D_{\\text{CCM}}^2}{L_{\\text{m}}^2 f_{\\text{s}}} = \\frac{(V_{\\text{in}} D_{\\text{CCM}})^2}{2 L_{\\text{m}} f_{\\text{s}}}$$\nThe given parameters are $L_{\\text{m}} = 400\\,\\mu\\mathrm{H} = 4 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{H}$ and $f_{\\text{s}} = 100\\,\\mathrm{kHz} = 10^5\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\nFor the nominal input voltage ($V_{\\text{in,nom}} = 36\\,\\mathrm{V}$):\n$$P_{\\text{out,B,nom}} = \\frac{(36\\,\\mathrm{V} \\times \\frac{4}{7})^2}{2 \\times (4 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{H}) \\times (10^5\\,\\mathrm{Hz})} = \\frac{(\\frac{144}{7})^2}{80} = \\frac{20736}{49 \\times 80} = \\frac{20736}{3920} \\approx 5.29\\,\\mathrm{W}$$\nThe actual output power is $P_{\\text{out}} = 60\\,\\mathrm{W}$. Since $P_{\\text{out}} (60\\,\\mathrm{W})  P_{\\text{out,B,nom}} (\\approx 5.29\\,\\mathrm{W})$, the converter is indeed operating in CCM at the nominal input voltage. Thus, the calculated duty cycle $D_{\\text{nom}} = 4/7$ is correct.\n\nFor the dipped input voltage ($V_{\\text{in,dip}} = 18\\,\\mathrm{V}$):\n$$P_{\\text{out,B,dip}} = \\frac{(18\\,\\mathrm{V} \\times \\frac{8}{11})^2}{2 \\times (4 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{H}) \\times (10^5\\,\\mathrm{Hz})} = \\frac{(\\frac{144}{11})^2}{80} = \\frac{20736}{121 \\times 80} = \\frac{20736}{9680} \\approx 2.14\\,\\mathrm{W}$$\nThe actual output power is $P_{\\text{out}} = 60\\,\\mathrm{W}$. Since $P_{\\text{out}} (60\\,\\mathrm{W})  P_{\\text{out,B,dip}} (\\approx 2.14\\,\\mathrm{W})$, the converter also operates in CCM at the dipped input voltage. Therefore, the calculated duty cycle $D_{\\text{dip}} = 8/11$ is also correct.\n\nThe problem states to re-derive the duty cycle using energy-per-cycle arguments if DCM were to arise. As our analysis shows conclusively that the converter remains in CCM for both operating points, this step is not necessary. The duty cycles calculated under the CCM assumption are valid.\n\nFinally, we compute the maximum duty cycle excursion, $\\Delta D_{\\max}$, which is the difference between the duty cycle at the minimum input voltage and the duty cycle at the nominal input voltage.\n$$\\Delta D_{\\max} = D_{\\text{dip}} - D_{\\text{nom}} = \\frac{8}{11} - \\frac{4}{7}$$\nTo find the difference, we use a common denominator of $77$:\n$$\\Delta D_{\\max} = \\frac{8 \\times 7}{11 \\times 7} - \\frac{4 \\times 11}{7 \\times 11} = \\frac{56}{77} - \\frac{44}{77} = \\frac{12}{77}$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal value:\n$$\\Delta D_{\\max} = \\frac{12}{77} \\approx 0.1558441558...$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required:\n$$\\Delta D_{\\max} \\approx 0.1558$$\nThis is the required excursion in the duty cycle for the converter to maintain the regulated output voltage of $12\\,\\mathrm{V}$ when the input line voltage dips from $36\\,\\mathrm{V}$ to $18\\,\\mathrm{V}$.",
