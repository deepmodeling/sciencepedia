To limit Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) and avoid spurious triggering of the complementary device, the device off-state voltage slew rate is constrained during turn-off by adding a resistor-capacitor (RC) snubber capacitor in parallel with the IGBT. The load current can be approximated as a constant current source during the voltage transition. The effective parasitic capacitance across the device, dominated by the device output capacitance and stray capacitances, can be taken as approximately constant over the relevant voltage range.\n\nAt time $t=0$, the IGBT begins turning off, and the current $I_{s}$ from the load commutates into the parallel combination of the parasitic capacitance $C_{p}$ and the added snubber capacitor $C_{s}$.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been meticulously validated. All givens were extracted and checked for scientific soundness, consistency, completeness, and objectivity. The problem is a standard, well-posed engineering calculation in power electronics, describing the design of a capacitive snubber to limit the voltage slew rate across a switching device. The provided data, including voltage, current, capacitance, and slew rate, are consistent and physically realistic for such an application. The simplifying assumptions, such as a constant load current and constant parasitic capacitance, are common and appropriate for a first-order analysis. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe physical principle governing this problem is the fundamental relationship between the current $i_C(t)$ flowing through a capacitor and the rate of change of voltage $v_C(t)$ across it:\n$$\ni_C(t) = C \\frac{d v_C(t)}{dt}\n$$\nIn this scenario, as the Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) turns off, the constant load current $I_s$ is diverted from the IGBT and must flow into the parallel combination of the device's intrinsic parasitic capacitance, $C_p$, and the externally added snubber capacitance, $C_s$. The total capacitance being charged by the current $I_s$ is therefore:\n$$\nC_{\\text{total}} = C_p + C_s\n$$\nThe voltage across this total capacitance is the voltage across the device, $v(t)$. The current charging this capacitance is $I_s$. Applying the fundamental capacitor equation, we get:\n$$\nI_s = C_{\\text{total}} \\frac{dv(t)}{dt}\n$$\nSince $I_s$ is assumed to be constant and $C_{\\text{total}}$ is also assumed constant, the voltage slew rate, $\\frac{dv}{dt}$, is constant. We can rearrange the equation to solve for the slew rate:\n$$\n\\frac{dv}{dt} = \\frac{I_s}{C_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{I_s}{C_p + C_s}\n$$\nThe design requirement is to limit this slew rate to a specified maximum value, $\\left(\\frac{dv}{dt}\\right)_{\\max}$. This imposes the following constraint:\n$$\n\\frac{I_s}{C_p + C_s} \\le \\left(\\frac{dv}{dt}\\right)_{\\max}\n$$\nThe problem provides a voltage swing of $\\Delta V = 900$ V and a corresponding transition time of $\\Delta t = 3.0$ µs. The average slew rate for a linear ramp is $\\frac{\\Delta V}{\\Delta t} = \\frac{900 \\text{ V}}{3.0 \\text{ µs}} = 300 \\frac{\\text{V}}{\\text{µs}}$. This value is identical to the specified maximum allowable slew rate, $\\left(\\frac{dv}{dt}\\right)_{\\max} = 300$ V/µs, confirming the consistency of the problem data.\n\nTo find the minimum required snubber capacitance $C_s$ that ensures this limit is met, we consider the boundary condition where the actual slew rate is exactly equal to the maximum allowable slew rate. A larger $C_s$ would result in a lower slew rate, so the value of $C_s$ that achieves the maximum rate is the minimum required value.\n$$\n\\frac{I_s}{C_p + C_{s, \\min}} = \\left(\\frac{dv}{dt}\\right)_{\\max}\n$$\nFirst, we solve for the total capacitance, $C_{\\text{total}}$, required to achieve this target slew rate:\n$$\nC_{\\text{total}} = C_p + C_{s, \\min} = \\frac{I_s}{\\left(\\frac{dv}{dt}\\right)_{\\max}}\n$$\nWe can now solve for the minimum snubber capacitance, $C_{s, \\min}$:\n$$\nC_{s, \\min} = \\frac{I_s}{\\left(\\frac{dv}{dt}\\right)_{\\max}} - C_p\n$$\nThe given values are:\n- Load current $I_s = 24$ A.\n- Parasitic capacitance $C_p = 6.8$ nF $= 6.8 \\times 10^{-9}$ F.\n- Maximum slew rate $\\left(\\frac{dv}{dt}\\right)_{\\max} = 300$ V/µs $= 300 \\frac{\\text{V}}{10^{-6} \\text{ s}} = 300 \\times 10^6$ V/s.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for the total capacitance:\n$$\nC_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{24 \\text{ A}}{300 \\times 10^6 \\text{ V/s}} = \\frac{24}{300} \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ F} = 0.08 \\times 10^{-6} \\text{ F} = 80 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ F}\n$$\nThis required total capacitance is $80$ nanofarads (nF).\nNow, we calculate the minimum required snubber capacitance by subtracting the existing parasitic capacitance:\n$$\nC_{s, \\min} = C_{\\text{total}} - C_p = 80 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ F} - 6.8 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ F} = 73.2 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ F}\n$$\nThe result is $73.2$ nF.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a standard power electronics scenario and requests a solution based on fundamental circuit theory and established engineering design principles.

The circuit consists of the loop stray inductance $L_s$ and the equivalent device capacitance $C_{eq}$. The turn-off event diverts the inductor current, which has an initial value of $I_0$, into the capacitor. The problem specifies modeling the incremental voltage across the capacitor, so the initial condition is $v_C(0^+) = 0$. The initial condition for the inductor current is $i_L(0^+) = I_0$.\n\nBased on Kirchhoff's laws and the constitutive relations for an inductor and a capacitor, the system dynamics are described by the second-order ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 v_C}{dt^2} + \\frac{1}{L_s C_{eq}} v_C(t) = 0\n$$\nThis is the equation for a simple harmonic oscillator. The angular resonance frequency $\\omega_r$ and the frequency $f_r$ are given by:\n$$\n\\omega_r = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{L_s C_{eq}}} \\quad \\implies \\quad f_r = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sqrt{L_s C_{eq}}}\n$$\nThis provides our first equation relating $L_s$ and $C_{eq}$. Squaring both sides and rearranging gives:\n$$\nL_s C_{eq} = \\left( \\frac{1}{2\\pi f_r} \\right)^2\n$$\nThe second relationship is derived from the principle of conservation of energy in the lossless LC circuit. The initial energy stored in the inductor, $E_L = \\frac{1}{2}L_s I_0^2$, is completely transferred to the capacitor at the first voltage peak, where the energy is $E_C = \\frac{1}{2}C_{eq} (\\Delta V_{peak})^2$. Equating these gives:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}L_s I_0^2 = \\frac{1}{2}C_{eq} (\\Delta V_{peak})^2\n$$\nRearranging this equation yields the ratio of $L_s$ to $C_{eq}$:\n$$\n\\frac{L_s}{C_{eq}} = \\left( \\frac{\\Delta V_{peak}}{I_0} \\right)^2\n$$\nWe are given $f_r = 30\\,\\mathrm{MHz} = 30 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$, $\\Delta V_{peak} = 80\\,\\mathrm{V}$, and $I_0 = 20\\,\\mathrm{A}$. We can now solve for $L_s$ and $C_{eq}$.\n\nFirst, calculate the product and ratio from the given data:\n$$\nL_s C_{eq} = \\left( \\frac{1}{2\\pi (30 \\times 10^6)} \\right)^2 \\approx 2.8143 \\times 10^{-17}\\,\\mathrm{s^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{L_s}{C_{eq}} = \\left( \\frac{80}{20} \\right)^2 = 4^2 = 16\\,\\mathrm{\\Omega^2}\n$$\nFrom the ratio, we express $L_s$ in terms of $C_{eq}$: $L_s = 16 C_{eq}$. We substitute this into the product equation:\n$$\n(16 C_{eq}) C_{eq} = 16 C_{eq}^2 = 2.8143 \\times 10^{-17}\\,\\mathrm{s^2}\n$$\nSolving for $C_{eq}$:\n$$\nC_{eq}^2 = \\frac{2.8143 \\times 10^{-17}}{16} \\approx 1.7589 \\times 10^{-18}\\,\\mathrm{F^2}\n$$\n$$\nC_{eq} = \\sqrt{1.7589 \\times 10^{-18}} \\approx 1.3262 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{F}\n$$\nNow, we solve for $L_s$:\n$$\nL_s = 16 \\times C_{eq} = 16 \\times (1.3262 \\times 10^{-9}) \\approx 2.1219 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{H}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: R-C Snubber Design ($C_{sn}$, $R_{sn}$)**\n\nAn R-C snubber, consisting of a resistor $R_{sn}$ and a capacitor $C_{sn}$ in series, is added in parallel with the device (and thus in parallel with $C_{eq}$).\n\n**Step 2a: Determine Snubber Capacitance $C_{sn}$**\n\nThe snubber capacitor $C_{sn}$ is chosen to reduce the peak voltage overshoot to a new target value, $\\Delta V'_{peak} = 10\\,\\mathrm{V}$, under the same initial current $I_0 = 20\\,\\mathrm{A}$. A standard design practice, consistent with a first-principles energy approach, is to assume that the peak voltage is determined by the transfer of initial inductor energy to the total capacitance across the device. This approach neglects the energy dissipated in the resistor during the first quarter-cycle, but is a robust first-order approximation.\n\nThe total effective capacitance is $C_{total} = C_{eq} + C_{sn}$.

This is a common design heuristic where the snubber resistance is set equal to the characteristic impedance of the resonant tank formed by the stray inductance $L_s$ and the total capacitance $C_{total}$.

The node is driven by an upstream network that, over the fast edge of interest, can be modeled as a Thevenin source consisting of a voltage step and a source resistance. The time-derivative of the node voltage, written as $dv/dt$, is inferred from oscilloscope measurements. However, the oscilloscope’s high-voltage passive probe loads the node with a finite input capacitance, thereby altering the effective node capacitance and the measured $dv/dt$.\n\nStarting from the capacitor constitutive relation $i_{C} = C \\, dv/dt$, Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL), and linear network principles (including the Thevenin equivalent), derive how adding the probe input capacitance changes the node’s effective capacitance and alters the initial slope of the node voltage during the fast transition.

The node's voltage is denoted by $v(t)$. The upstream network driving the node is represented by its Thevenin equivalent, which consists of a voltage source $V_{\\text{th}}(t)$ and a series resistance $R_{\\text{th}}$. For a fast switching transition, $V_{\\text{th}}(t)$ is a voltage step. The node itself has a total capacitance to ground, which is the sum of all parallel-connected capacitances.\n\nLet us define two scenarios:\n1.  **The \"true\" scenario:** This is the circuit's behavior without any measurement probe connected. The total capacitance at the node, which we will call $C_{\\text{true}}$, is the sum of the intrinsic device capacitance $C_{\\text{intrinsic}}$, the snubber capacitance $C_{\\text{snub}}$, and the stray layout capacitance $C_{\\text{stray}}$.\n    $$C_{\\text{true}} = C_{\\text{intrinsic}} + C_{\\text{snub}} + C_{\\text{stray}}$$\n2.  **The \"measured\" scenario:** This is the circuit's behavior with the oscilloscope probe connected to the node.

This initial current is determined solely by the characteristics of the driving circuit and the initial state of the node, not by the load capacitance $C_{\\text{total}}$.
