The model of a voltage source driving a rectifier with a clamping voltage is a fundamental and scientifically sound approach for this analysis.

It is a rigorous exercise in applying circuit theory and Fourier analysis to a standard power electronics model. The solution will now be derived by following the steps outlined in the problem statement.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nLet the instantaneous Thevenin source voltage be $v_{s}(t) = V_{s}(\\omega)\\sin(\\omega t)$. The analysis will be performed in the angle domain with $\\phi = \\omega t$. Thus, $v_{s}(\\phi) = V_{s}(\\omega)\\sin(\\phi)$. The rectifier is connected to the Thevenin source, and the current flowing from the source is $i_{s}(\\phi)$. The circuit equation is $v_{s}(\\phi) = i_{s}(\\phi)R_{s}(\\omega) + v_{\\text{rect}}(\\phi)$, where $v_{\\text{rect}}(\\phi)$ is the voltage at the rectifier input.\n\n**1. Determination of the Conduction Angle $\\theta$**\n\nThe diodes in the full-wave rectifier conduct only when the magnitude of the driving voltage is sufficient to overcome the clamped output voltage $V_{o}$. For the positive half-cycle of the current, conduction begins when the source voltage $v_{s}(\\phi)$ attempts to exceed $V_{o}$. The current $i_s(\\phi)$ is non-zero only when $|v_s(\\phi)| > |v_{\\text{rect}}(\\phi)|$. When conducting, $v_{\\text{rect}}(\\phi) = V_{o}$. Therefore, the current becomes zero when $v_{s}(\\phi) = V_{o}$.\nThe problem defines $\\theta \\in (0, \\pi/2)$ as the conduction angle. In this context, $\\theta$ represents the angle at which conduction begins in the first quadrant.\n$$V_{s}(\\omega)\\sin(\\theta) = V_{o}$$\nDue to the symmetry of the sine wave, conduction in the first half-period (from $\\phi=0$ to $\\phi=\\pi$) occurs over the interval $[\\theta, \\pi - \\theta]$. The relation $\\theta = \\arcsin(V_{o}/V_{s}(\\omega))$ determines the conduction angle as a function of $V_{o}$ and $V_{s}(\\omega)$.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Fundamental Current Amplitude $I_{1}(\\theta)$**\n\nDuring the conduction interval $[\\theta, \\pi - \\theta]$, the voltage across the resistance $R_{s}(\\omega)$ is $v_{s}(\\phi) - V_{o}$. The current is given by:\n$$i_{s}(\\phi) = \\frac{v_{s}(\\phi) - V_{o}}{R_{s}(\\omega)} = \\frac{V_{s}(\\omega)\\sin(\\phi) - V_{o}}{R_{s}(\\omega)}$$\nOutside this interval in the first half-period, $i_{s}(\\phi) = 0$. The waveform has odd symmetry, $i_{s}(\\phi+\\pi) = -i_{s}(\\phi)$, so the Fourier series contains only sine terms. The amplitude of the fundamental component, $I_{1}(\\theta)$, is the Fourier coefficient $b_{1}$.\n$$I_{1}(\\theta) = b_{1} = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} i_{s}(\\phi)\\sin(\\phi) d\\phi = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} i_{s}(\\phi)\\sin(\\phi) d\\phi$$\nSubstituting the expression for $i_{s}(\\phi)$:\n$$I_{1}(\\theta) = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_{\\theta}^{\\pi-\\theta} \\left( \\frac{V_{s}(\\omega)\\sin(\\phi) - V_{o}}{R_{s}(\\omega)} \\right) \\sin(\\phi) d\\phi$$\n$$I_{1}(\\theta) = \\frac{2}{\\pi R_{s}(\\omega)} \\int_{\\theta}^{\\pi-\\theta} \\left( V_{s}(\\omega)\\sin^{2}(\\phi) - V_{o}\\sin(\\phi) \\right) d\\phi$$\nWe evaluate the integral in two parts.\nPart 1: $\\int \\sin^{2}(\\phi) d\\phi = \\int \\frac{1 - \\cos(2\\phi)}{2} d\\phi = \\frac{\\phi}{2} - \\frac{\\sin(2\\phi)}{4}$.\n$$\\int_{\\theta}^{\\pi-\\theta} \\sin^{2}(\\phi) d\\phi = \\left[ \\frac{\\phi}{2} - \\frac{\\sin(2\\phi)}{4} \\right]_{\\theta}^{\\pi-\\theta} = \\left(\\frac{\\pi-\\theta}{2} - \\frac{\\sin(2\\pi-2\\theta)}{4}\\right) - \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2} - \\frac{\\sin(2\\theta)}{4}\\right)$$\n$$= \\frac{\\pi - 2\\theta}{2} - \\frac{-\\sin(2\\theta) - \\sin(2\\theta)}{4} = \\frac{\\pi - 2\\theta}{2} + \\frac{\\sin(2\\theta)}{2}$$\nPart 2: $\\int \\sin(\\phi) d\\phi = -\\cos(\\phi)$.\n$$\\int_{\\theta}^{\\pi-\\theta} \\sin(\\phi) d\\phi = [-\\cos(\\phi)]_{\\theta}^{\\pi-\\theta} = -\\cos(\\pi-\\theta) - (-\\cos(\\theta)) = \\cos(\\theta) + \\cos(\\theta) = 2\\cos(\\theta)$$\nCombining the parts:\n$$I_{1}(\\theta) = \\frac{2}{\\pi R_{s}(\\omega)} \\left( V_{s}(\\omega)\\left[ \\frac{\\pi - 2\\theta + \\sin(2\\theta)}{2} \\right] - V_{o}\\left[ 2\\cos(\\theta) \\right] \\right)$$\nNow, we substitute $V_{o} = V_{s}(\\omega)\\sin(\\theta)$ and use the identity $\\sin(2\\theta) = 2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)$.\n$$I_{1}(\\theta) = \\frac{2V_{s}(\\omega)}{\\pi R_{s}(\\omega)} \\left( \\frac{\\pi - 2\\theta + 2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)}{2} - 2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta) \\right)$$\n$$I_{1}(\\theta) = \\frac{V_{s}(\\omega)}{\\pi R_{s}(\\omega)} \\left( \\pi - 2\\theta + 2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta) - 4\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta) \\right)$$\n$$I_{1}(\\theta) = \\frac{V_{s}(\\omega)}{\\pi R_{s}(\\omega)} \\left( \\pi - 2\\theta - 2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta) \\right)$$\n$$I_{1}(\\theta) = \\frac{V_{s}(\\omega)}{\\pi R_{s}(\\omega)} \\left( \\pi - 2\\theta - \\sin(2\\theta) \\right)$$\n\n**3. Derivation of Effective Resistances $R_{eq}(\\theta)$ and $R_{ac}'(\\theta)$**\n\nThe problem defines the effective secondary-side fundamental resistance seen by the Thevenin source as $R_{eq}(\\theta) = V_{s}(\\omega)/I_{1}(\\theta)$. Using the expression for $I_{1}(\\theta)$:\n$$R_{eq}(\\theta) = \\frac{V_{s}(\\omega)}{\\frac{V_{s}(\\omega)}{\\pi R_{s}(\\omega)} \\left( \\pi - 2\\theta - \\sin(2\\theta) \\right)} = \\frac{\\pi R_{s}(\\omega)}{\\pi - 2\\theta - \\sin(2\\theta)}$$\nThis represents the total effective resistance connected to the ideal voltage source $V_s(\\omega)$, which is the sum of the Thevenin resistance $R_s(\\omega)$ and the effective resistance of the rectifier-load stage.\nThe effective load resistance is then referred to the primary side using the turns ratio $n$:\n$$R_{ac}'(\\theta) = n^{2} R_{eq}(\\theta) = \\frac{\\pi n^{2} R_{s}(\\omega)}{\\pi - 2\\theta - \\sin(2\\theta)}$$\n\n**4. Derivation of the Quality Factor $Q(\\theta)$**\n\nThe quality factor $Q$ is defined as $Q = R_{ac}'/(\\omega_{0} L_{r})$. Substituting the derived expression for $R_{ac}'(\\theta)$:\n$$Q(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{\\omega_{0}L_{r}} \\left( \\frac{\\pi n^{2} R_{s}(\\omega)}{\\pi - 2\\theta - \\sin(2\\theta)} \\right)$$\nThis gives the final closed-form expression for $Q(\\theta)$ in terms of the specified parameters, with $V_o$ and $V_s(\\omega)$ being implicitly represented by $\\theta$.\n$$Q(\\theta) = \\frac{\\pi n^{2} R_{s}(\\omega)}{(\\omega_{0} L_{r}) \\left( \\pi - 2\\theta - \\sin(2\\theta) \\right)}$$",

The same logic applies to the parameter $C_r$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial M_{\\mathrm{pk}}}{\\partial C_r} = \\left. \\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial \\omega} \\right|_{\\omega=\\omega_{\\mathrm{pk}}} \\frac{\\partial \\omega_{\\mathrm{pk}}}{\\partial C_r} + \\left. \\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial C_r} \\right|_{\\omega=\\omega_{\\mathrm{pk}}} = \\left. \\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial C_r} \\right|_{\\omega=\\omega_{\\mathrm{pk}}} $$\nFor small, finite perturbations $\\Delta L_r$ and $\\Delta C_r$, we can approximate the change in $M_{\\mathrm{pk}}$ as $\\Delta M_{\\mathrm{pk}} \\approx dM_{\\mathrm{pk}}$:\n$$ \\Delta M_{\\mathrm{pk}} \\approx \\left( \\left. \\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial L_r} \\right|_{\\omega=\\omega_{\\mathrm{pk}}} \\right) \\Delta L_r + \\left( \\left. \\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial C_r} \\right|_{\\omega=\\omega_{\\mathrm{pk}}} \\right) \\Delta C_r $$\nThe corresponding fractional change, $\\frac{\\Delta M_{\\mathrm{pk}}}{M_{\\mathrm{pk}}}$, is obtained by dividing by $M_{\\mathrm{pk}}$ and rearranging to group fractional perturbations $\\frac{\\Delta L_r}{L_r}$ and $\\frac{\\Delta C_r}{C_r}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta M_{\\mathrm{pk}}}{M_{\\mathrm{pk}}} \\approx \\left( \\frac{L_r}{M_{\\mathrm{pk}}} \\left. \\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial L_r} \\right|_{\\omega=\\omega_{\\mathrm{pk}}} \\right) \\frac{\\Delta L_r}{L_r} + \\left( \\frac{C_r}{M_{\\mathrm{pk}}} \\left. \\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial C_r} \\right|_{\\omega=\\omega_{\\mathrm{pk}}} \\right) \\frac{\\Delta C_r}{C_r} $$\n\n**Part 2: Logarithmic Sensitivities and Worst-Case Reduction**\n\nThe problem defines the logarithmic sensitivities of the peak gain $M_{\\mathrm{pk}}$ with respect to $L_r$ and $C_r$ as $S_{L_r}$ and $S_{C_r}$. These are defined as:\n$$ S_{L_r} = \\frac{\\partial (\\ln M_{\\mathrm{pk}})}{\\partial (\\ln L_r)} = \\frac{L_r}{M_{\\mathrm{pk}}}\\frac{\\partial M_{\\mathrm{pk}}}{\\partial L_r} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad S_{C_r} = \\frac{\\partial (\\ln M_{\\mathrm{pk}})}{\\partial (\\ln C_r)} = \\frac{C_r}{M_{\\mathrm{pk}}}\\frac{\\partial M_{\\mathrm{pk}}}{\\partial C_r} $$\nThe expressions derived in Part 1 correspond exactly to these definitions. Therefore, we can express the fractional change in $M_{\\mathrm{pk}}$ compactly as:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta M_{\\mathrm{pk}}}{M_{\\mathrm{pk}}} \\approx S_{L_r} \\frac{\\Delta L_r}{L_r} + S_{C_r} \\frac{\\Delta C_r}{C_r} $$\nThe components $L_r$ and $C_r$ have independent tolerances of $\\pm 10\\%$, meaning $-0.1 \\le \\frac{\\Delta L_r}{L_r} \\le +0.1$ and $-0.1 \\le \\frac{\\Delta C_r}{C_r} \\le +0.1$.\nThe worst-case fractional reduction in $M_{\\mathrm{pk}}$ occurs when the fractional change $\\frac{\\Delta M_{\\mathrm{pk}}}{M_{\\mathrm{pk}}}$ is minimized (i.e., made most negative). For the linear combination above, this happens when the perturbations $\\frac{\\Delta L_r}{L_r}$ and $\\frac{\\Delta C_r}{C_r}$ take their maximum magnitude of $0.1$ with signs opposite to those of their respective sensitivity coefficients $S_{L_r}$ and $S_{C_r}$.\nThe minimum fractional change is:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\Delta M_{\\mathrm{pk}}}{M_{\\mathrm{pk}}} \\right)_{\\min} = -0.1 |S_{L_r}| - 0.1 |S_{C_r}| = -0.1 \\left( |S_{L_r}| + |S_{C_r}| \\right) $$\nThe worst-case fractional reduction, denoted $R_{wc}$, is the positive value corresponding to this drop:\n$$ R_{wc} = \\left| \\left( \\frac{\\Delta M_{\\mathrm{pk}}}{M_{\\mathrm{pk}}} \\right)_{\\min} \\right| = 0.1 \\left( |S_{L_r}| + |S_{C_r}| \\right) $$\n\n**Part 3: Design Margin Factor $\\Gamma$**\n\nTo guarantee that the converter gain meets the minimum requirement $M_{\\mathrm{req}}$, the nominal design must account for the worst-case reduction. The lowest possible peak gain, $M_{\\mathrm{pk},\\text{worst}}$, starting from a nominal value $M_{\\mathrm{pk},\\text{nom}}$, is:\n$$ M_{\\mathrm{pk},\\text{worst}} = M_{\\mathrm{pk},\\text{nom}}(1 - R_{wc}) = M_{\\mathrm{pk},\\text{nom}} \\left( 1 - 0.1 \\left( |S_{L_r}| + |S_{C_r}| \\right) \\right) $$\nThe regulation condition is that this worst-case gain must be no less than the required gain:\n$$ M_{\\mathrm{pk},\\text{worst}} \\ge M_{\\mathrm{req}} $$\n$$ M_{\\mathrm{pk},\\text{nom}} \\left( 1 - 0.1 \\left( |S_{L_r}| + |S_{C_r}| \\right) \\right) \\ge M_{\\mathrm{req}} $$\nThe problem asks for a design margin factor $\\Gamma$ such that the nominal design must satisfy $M_{\\mathrm{pk},\\text{nom}} \\ge \\Gamma \\, M_{\\mathrm{req}}$. By rearranging the inequality above to isolate $M_{\\mathrm{pk},\\text{nom}}$, we get:\n$$ M_{\\mathrm{pk},\\text{nom}} \\ge \\frac{M_{\\mathrm{req}}}{1 - 0.1 \\left( |S_{L_r}| + |S_{C_r}| \\right)} $$\nBy direct comparison with the required form $M_{\\mathrm{pk},\\text{nom}} \\ge \\Gamma \\, M_{\\mathrm{req}}$, we identify the design margin factor $\\Gamma$ as:\n$$ \\Gamma = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.1 \\left( |S_{L_r}| + |S_{C_r}| \\right)} $$\nThis provides the closed-form expression for the design margin factor based on the defined logarithmic sensitivities.",
