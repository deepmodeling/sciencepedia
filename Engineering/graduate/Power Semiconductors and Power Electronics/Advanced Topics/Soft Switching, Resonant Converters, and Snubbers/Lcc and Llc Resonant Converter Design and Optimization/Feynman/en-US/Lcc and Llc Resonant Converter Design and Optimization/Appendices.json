            "problem": "A high-frequency Inductor-Inductor-Capacitor (LLC) resonant converter employs a transformer whose magnetizing branch is modeled by a linear inductance. The converter uses frequency modulation to regulate output, such that the magnetizing current waveform is quasi-sinusoidal and centered around zero, with an amplitude that depends on the switching frequency. Let the magnetizing inductance be denoted by $L_{m}$, the number of primary turns by $N$, and the effective core cross-sectional area by $A_{c}$. The magnetizing current is $i_{m}(t)$, and the core flux density is $B(t)$. Assume the core is operated in its linear region and the magnetic material is lossless for the purpose of this derivation.

All provided information is consistent and allows for a unique derivation.\n\nWe begin the derivation by listing the fundamental relationships provided in the problem statement.\nThe flux linkage, $\\lambda(t)$, is defined in two ways:\n1. In terms of magnetic flux $\\Phi(t)$ and the number of primary turns $N$:\n$$\n\\lambda(t) = N\\,\\Phi(t)\n$$\n2. In terms of the magnetizing inductance $L_{m}$ and the magnetizing current $i_{m}(t)$:\n$$\n\\lambda(t) = L_{m}\\,i_{m}(t)\n$$\nBy equating these two expressions for the flux linkage, we can establish a direct relationship between the magnetizing current and the magnetic flux:\n$$\nN\\,\\Phi(t) = L_{m}\\,i_{m}(t)\n$$\nSolving for the magnetic flux $\\Phi(t)$ yields:\n$$\n\\Phi(t) = \\frac{L_{m}}{N} i_{m}(t)\n$$\nThe problem defines the relationship between the magnetic flux $\\Phi(t)$ and the core flux density $B(t)$ via the effective core cross-sectional area $A_{c}$:\n$$\nB(t) = \\frac{\\Phi(t)}{A_{c}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Phi(t)$ into the equation for $B(t)$, we obtain the flux density as a function of the magnetizing current:\n$$\nB(t) = \\frac{1}{A_{c}} \\left(\\frac{L_{m}}{N} i_{m}(t)\\right) = \\frac{L_{m}}{N\\,A_{c}} i_{m}(t)\n$$\nThe problem states that for frequency-modulated LLC operation, the magnetizing current can be modeled as a sinusoidal waveform with a zero average value. This is a standard application of the Fundamental Harmonic Approximation (FHA). The current is given as:\n$$\ni_{m}(t) = I_{m}(f)\\,\\sin(\\omega t + \\varphi)\n$$\nwhere $I_{m}(f)$ is the amplitude of the magnetizing current at a given switching frequency $f$, and $\\omega = 2\\pi f$. Substituting this sinusoidal waveform into our expression for $B(t)$ gives:\n$$\nB(t) = \\frac{L_{m}\\,I_{m}(f)}{N\\,A_{c}} \\sin(\\omega t + \\varphi)\n$$\nThis equation shows that the core flux density $B(t)$ is also a sinusoidal function of time, centered around zero, which is a direct consequence of the assumed zero-average magnetizing current and the linear, lossless core model.\n\nOur first objective is to find the peak-to-peak core flux density swing, $\\Delta B$. This is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values of $B(t)$.\nThe maximum value of $B(t)$, denoted $B_{\\text{max}}$, occurs when the term $\\sin(\\omega t + \\varphi)$ is equal to its maximum value of $1$:\n$$\nB_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{L_{m}\\,I_{m}(f)}{N\\,A_{c}}\n$$\nThe minimum value of $B(t)$, denoted $B_{\\text{min}}$, occurs when $\\sin(\\omega t + \\varphi)$ is equal to its minimum value of $-1$:\n$$\nB_{\\text{min}} = -\\frac{L_{m}\\,I_{m}(f)}{N\\,A_{c}}\n$$\nThe peak-to-peak swing $\\Delta B$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\Delta B = B_{\\text{max}} - B_{\\text{min}} = \\left(\\frac{L_{m}\\,I_{m}(f)}{N\\,A_{c}}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{L_{m}\\,I_{m}(f)}{N\\,A_{c}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta B = 2\\frac{L_{m}\\,I_{m}(f)}{N\\,A_{c}}\n$$\nThis is the required expression for the peak-to-peak flux density swing.\n\nOur second objective is to derive a design constraint on the magnetizing current amplitude $I_{m}(f)$ to prevent core saturation. The given constraint is $|B(t)| \\leq \\eta B_{\\text{sat}}$, where $B_{\\text{sat}}$ is the saturation flux density and $0  \\eta  1$ is a safety factor.\nThis condition must hold for all time $t$. Therefore, the peak absolute value of the flux density, $B_{\\text{peak}} = \\max(|B(t)|)$, must not exceed the limit:\n$$\nB_{\\text{peak}} \\le \\eta B_{\\text{sat}}\n$$\nFrom our expression for $B(t)$, the peak value is simply the amplitude of the sinusoidal waveform:\n$$\nB_{\\text{peak}} = \\frac{L_{m}\\,I_{m}(f)}{N\\,A_{c}}\n$$\nNote that $B_{\\text{peak}} = \\frac{\\Delta B}{2}$.\nSubstituting this into the inequality gives:\n$$\n\\frac{L_{m}\\,I_{m}(f)}{N\\,A_{c}} \\le \\eta B_{\\text{sat}}\n$$\nTo find the constraint on $I_{m}(f)$, we rearrange the inequality by solving for $I_{m}(f)$:\n$$\nI_{m}(f) \\le \\frac{\\eta B_{\\text{sat}} N A_{c}}{L_{m}}\n$$\nThis inequality represents the design constraint on the amplitude of the magnetizing current, ensuring that the transformer core does not enter saturation during operation.

            "solution": "The problem statement is parsed and determined to be valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information to derive the requested symbolic expression. The solution proceeds in three parts as requested.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Fractional Change in Peak Gain**\n\nThe small-signal voltage gain magnitude $M$ is a function of the angular frequency $\\omega$ and the component values $L_r$, $C_r$, $L_m$, and $R_p$. We can write this as $M(\\omega; L_r, C_r, L_m, R_p)$. The peak gain, $M_{\\mathrm{pk}}$, is the value of this function at the peak frequency, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{pk}}$. Both $M_{\\mathrm{pk}}$ and $\\omega_{\\mathrm{pk}}$ depend on the component values. We are interested in the effects of small variations in $L_r$ and $C_r$, so we can express the peak gain as a function $M_{\\mathrm{pk}}(L_r, C_r) = M(\\omega_{\\mathrm{pk}}(L_r, C_r), L_r, C_r)$, keeping $L_m$ and $R_p$ constant.\n\nThe total differential of $M_{\\mathrm{pk}}$ for infinitesimal changes $dL_r$ and $dC_r$ is given by:\n$$ dM_{\\mathrm{pk}} = \\frac{\\partial M_{\\mathrm{pk}}}{\\partial L_r} dL_r + \\frac{\\partial M_{\\mathrm{pk}}}{\\partial C_r} dC_r $$\nTo evaluate the partial derivatives, we apply the multivariable chain rule. For the partial derivative with respect to $L_r$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial M_{\\mathrm{pk}}}{\\partial L_r} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial L_r} M(\\omega_{\\mathrm{pk}}(L_r, C_r), L_r, C_r) = \\left. \\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial \\omega} \\right|_{\\omega=\\omega_{\\mathrm{pk}}} \\frac{\\partial \\omega_{\\mathrm{pk}}}{\\partial L_r} + \\left. \\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial L_r} \\right|_{\\omega=\\omega_{\\mathrm{pk}}} $$\nA key property of the peak frequency $\\omega_{\\mathrm{pk}}$ is that it corresponds to a local maximum of the gain function $M$. Therefore, the partial derivative of $M$ with respect to $\\omega$ must be zero at this frequency:\n$$ \\left. \\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial \\omega} \\right|_{\\omega=\\omega_{\\mathrm{pk}}} = 0 $$\nSubstituting this condition into the expression for $\\frac{\\partial M_{\\mathrm{pk}}}{\\partial L_r}$ causes the first term to vanish:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial M_{\\mathrm{pk}}}{\\partial L_r} = (0) \\cdot \\frac{\\partial \\omega_{\\mathrm{pk}}}{\\partial L_r} + \\left. \\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial L_r} \\right|_{\\omega=\\omega_{\\mathrm{pk}}} = \\left. \\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial L_r} \\right|_{\\omega=\\omega_{\\mathrm{pk}}} $$\nThis demonstrates that, to a first-order approximation, the change in the peak gain value due to a variation in $L_r$ is independent of the resulting shift in the peak frequency $\\omega_{\\mathrm{pk}}$. The same logic applies to the parameter $C_r$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial M_{\\mathrm{pk}}}{\\partial C_r} = \\left. \\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial \\omega} \\right|_{\\omega=\\omega_{\\mathrm{pk}}} \\frac{\\partial \\omega_{\\mathrm{pk}}}{\\partial C_r} + \\left. \\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial C_r} \\right|_{\\omega=\\omega_{\\mathrm{pk}}} = \\left. \\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial C_r} \\right|_{\\omega=\\omega_{\\mathrm{pk}}} $$\nFor small, finite perturbations $\\Delta L_r$ and $\\Delta C_r$, we can approximate the change in $M_{\\mathrm{pk}}$ as $\\Delta M_{\\mathrm{pk}} \\approx dM_{\\mathrm{pk}}$:\n$$ \\Delta M_{\\mathrm{pk}} \\approx \\left( \\left. \\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial L_r} \\right|_{\\omega=\\omega_{\\mathrm{pk}}} \\right) \\Delta L_r + \\left( \\left. \\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial C_r} \\right|_{\\omega=\\omega_{\\mathrm{pk}}} \\right) \\Delta C_r $$\nThe corresponding fractional change, $\\frac{\\Delta M_{\\mathrm{pk}}}{M_{\\mathrm{pk}}}$, is obtained by dividing by $M_{\\mathrm{pk}}$ and rearranging to group fractional perturbations $\\frac{\\Delta L_r}{L_r}$ and $\\frac{\\Delta C_r}{C_r}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta M_{\\mathrm{pk}}}{M_{\\mathrm{pk}}} \\approx \\left( \\frac{L_r}{M_{\\mathrm{pk}}} \\left. \\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial L_r} \\right|_{\\omega=\\omega_{\\mathrm{pk}}} \\right) \\frac{\\Delta L_r}{L_r} + \\left( \\frac{C_r}{M_{\\mathrm{pk}}} \\left. \\frac{\\partial M}{\\partial C_r} \\right|_{\\omega=\\omega_{\\mathrm{pk}}} \\right) \\frac{\\Delta C_r}{C_r} $$\n\n**Part 2: Logarithmic Sensitivities and Worst-Case Reduction**\n\nThe problem defines the logarithmic sensitivities of the peak gain $M_{\\mathrm{pk}}$ with respect to $L_r$ and $C_r$ as $S_{L_r}$ and $S_{C_r}$. These are defined as:\n$$ S_{L_r} = \\frac{\\partial (\\ln M_{\\mathrm{pk}})}{\\partial (\\ln L_r)} = \\frac{L_r}{M_{\\mathrm{pk}}}\\frac{\\partial M_{\\mathrm{pk}}}{\\partial L_r} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad S_{C_r} = \\frac{\\partial (\\ln M_{\\mathrm{pk}})}{\\partial (\\ln C_r)} = \\frac{C_r}{M_{\\mathrm{pk}}}\\frac{\\partial M_{\\mathrm{pk}}}{\\partial C_r} $$\nThe expressions derived in Part 1 correspond exactly to these definitions. Therefore, we can express the fractional change in $M_{\\mathrm{pk}}$ compactly as:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta M_{\\mathrm{pk}}}{M_{\\mathrm{pk}}} \\approx S_{L_r} \\frac{\\Delta L_r}{L_r} + S_{C_r} \\frac{\\Delta C_r}{C_r} $$\nThe components $L_r$ and $C_r$ have independent tolerances of $\\pm 10\\%$, meaning $-0.1 \\le \\frac{\\Delta L_r}{L_r} \\le +0.1$ and $-0.1 \\le \\frac{\\Delta C_r}{C_r} \\le +0.1$.\nThe worst-case fractional reduction in $M_{\\mathrm{pk}}$ occurs when the fractional change $\\frac{\\Delta M_{\\mathrm{pk}}}{M_{\\mathrm{pk}}}$ is minimized (i.e., made most negative). For the linear combination above, this happens when the perturbations $\\frac{\\Delta L_r}{L_r}$ and $\\frac{\\Delta C_r}{C_r}$ take their maximum magnitude of $0.1$ with signs opposite to those of their respective sensitivity coefficients $S_{L_r}$ and $S_{C_r}$.\nThe minimum fractional change is:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\Delta M_{\\mathrm{pk}}}{M_{\\mathrm{pk}}} \\right)_{\\min} = -0.1 |S_{L_r}| - 0.1 |S_{C_r}| = -0.1 \\left( |S_{L_r}| + |S_{C_r}| \\right) $$\nThe worst-case fractional reduction, denoted $R_{wc}$, is the positive value corresponding to this drop:\n$$ R_{wc} = \\left| \\left( \\frac{\\Delta M_{\\mathrm{pk}}}{M_{\\mathrm{pk}}} \\right)_{\\min} \\right| = 0.1 \\left( |S_{L_r}| + |S_{C_r}| \\right) $$\n\n**Part 3: Design Margin Factor $\\Gamma$**\n\nTo guarantee that the converter gain meets the minimum requirement $M_{\\mathrm{req}}$, the nominal design must account for the worst-case reduction. The lowest possible peak gain, $M_{\\mathrm{pk},\\text{worst}}$, starting from a nominal value $M_{\\mathrm{pk},\\text{nom}}$, is:\n$$ M_{\\mathrm{pk},\\text{worst}} = M_{\\mathrm{pk},\\text{nom}}(1 - R_{wc}) = M_{\\mathrm{pk},\\text{nom}} \\left( 1 - 0.1 \\left( |S_{L_r}| + |S_{C_r}| \\right) \\right) $$\nThe regulation condition is that this worst-case gain must be no less than the required gain:\n$$ M_{\\mathrm{pk},\\text{worst}} \\ge M_{\\mathrm{req}} $$\n$$ M_{\\mathrm{pk},\\text{nom}} \\left( 1 - 0.1 \\left( |S_{L_r}| + |S_{C_r}| \\right) \\right) \\ge M_{\\mathrm{req}} $$\nThe problem asks for a design margin factor $\\Gamma$ such that the nominal design must satisfy $M_{\\mathrm{pk},\\text{nom}} \\ge \\Gamma \\, M_{\\mathrm{req}}$. By rearranging the inequality above to isolate $M_{\\mathrm{pk},\\text{nom}}$, we get:\n$$ M_{\\mathrm{pk},\\text{nom}} \\ge \\frac{M_{\\mathrm{req}}}{1 - 0.1 \\left( |S_{L_r}| + |S_{C_r}| \\right)} $$\nBy direct comparison with the required form $M_{\\mathrm{pk},\\text{nom}} \\ge \\Gamma \\, M_{\\mathrm{req}}$, we identify the design margin factor $\\Gamma$ as:\n$$ \\Gamma = \\frac{1}{1 - 0.1 \\left( |S_{L_r}| + |S_{C_r}| \\right)} $$\nThis provides the closed-form expression for the design margin factor based on the defined logarithmic sensitivities.",

Negative damping implies that a perturbation (e.g., an increase in tank voltage) causes a decrease in the power drawn from the tank, which corresponds to a negative incremental resistance. This can lead to instability. Such a phenomenon typically requires power to be fed back from the converter's output to the resonant tank.\n\nIn the context of synchronous rectification, this reverse power flow occurs if a MOSFET is kept on after its corresponding current half-cycle is complete and the current reverses direction. This is a consequence of a *turn-off* delay.\n\nThe problem, however, describes a *turn-on* delay $\\tau$, often called a dead-time. During this interval $t \\in [0, \\tau]$, the secondary current $i_s(t) = \\hat{I}\\sin(\\omega_s t)$ is positive. The current naturally flows through the body diode of the synchronous rectifier MOSFET, which is a passive and dissipative process. The power delivered to the output stage is $V_o i_s(t)$, which is positive. The power dissipated in the rectifier is $V_d i_s(t)$, which is also positive. At no point during this misalignment interval is power returned from the output capacitor to the resonant tank.\n\nOur derived expression for the added power dissipation, $\\Delta P = \\frac{\\omega_s}{\\pi} \\int_0^{\\tau} i_s(t) [V_d - R_{\\mathrm{on}} i_s(t)] \\,dt$, confirms this. For the given parameters, the maximum voltage drop across the MOSFET would be $\\hat{I} R_{\\mathrm{on}} = 7.5\\pi \\times 6 \\times 10^{-3} \\approx 0.141 \\ \\mathrm{V}$. Since this is much smaller than the diode forward drop $V_d = 0.9 \\ \\mathrm{V}$, the term $[V_d - R_{\\mathrm{on}} i_s(t)]$ is always positive. As $i_s(t)$ is also positive in the interval, the integrand is strictly positive, leading to $\\Delta P  0$.\n\nThis means the turn-on delay results in *additional* power dissipation compared to the ideal case. An increase in dissipation corresponds to an increase in positive damping. Since there is no mechanism for reverse power flow, and the non-ideality only adds to the losses, the rectifier stage always presents a positive, dissipative load to the tank. Therefore, the small-signal damping seen by the resonant tank cannot become negative for the given turn-on delay.",
