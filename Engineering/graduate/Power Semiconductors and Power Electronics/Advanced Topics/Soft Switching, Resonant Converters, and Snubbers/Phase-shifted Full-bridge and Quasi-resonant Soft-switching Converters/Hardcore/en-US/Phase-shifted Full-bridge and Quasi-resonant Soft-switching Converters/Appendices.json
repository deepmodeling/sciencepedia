Therefore, the current flowing out of the capacitor is $I_m$. This leads to a decrease in the voltage across it. The governing differential equation is:\n$$\nI_m = -C_{\\mathrm{oss}}(v) \\frac{dv}{dt}\n$$\nHere, $v$ is the drain-source voltage, and $C_{\\mathrm{oss}}(v)$ is the voltage-dependent output capacitance given by:\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{oss}}(v) = C_f + \\frac{C_s}{1 + v/V_s}\n$$\nWe need to find the minimal constant current $I_m$ that will discharge the capacitor from an initial voltage $V_{\\mathrm{off}}$ to $0$ V over a specified dead-time $t_d$. This means we need to find the value of $I_m$ such that $v(0) = V_{\\mathrm{off}}$ and $v(t_d) = 0$.\n\nWe can separate the variables in the differential equation to solve for the time required for the voltage to change:\n$$\ndt = -\\frac{1}{I_m} C_{\\mathrm{oss}}(v) \\, dv\n$$\nTo find the total dead-time $t_d$, we integrate this equation over the corresponding time and voltage intervals. The time $t$ spans from $0$ to $t_d$, while the voltage $v$ spans from $V_{\\mathrm{off}}$ to $0$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t_d} dt = \\int_{V_{\\mathrm{off}}}^{0} -\\frac{1}{I_m} \\left( C_f + \\frac{C_s}{1 + v/V_s} \\right) dv\n$$\nSince $I_m$ is constant, we can take it out of the integral.

Let $u = 1 + v/V_s$. Then $du = (1/V_s) dv$, which means $dv = V_s du$. The limits of integration for $v$ from $0$ to $V_{\\mathrm{off}}$ correspond to limits for $u$ from $1$ to $1 + V_{\\mathrm{off}}/V_s$.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{V_{\\mathrm{off}}} \\frac{C_s}{1 + v/V_s} \\, dv = \\int_{1}^{1 + V_{\\mathrm{off}}/V_s} \\frac{C_s}{u} (V_s \\, du) = C_s V_s \\int_{1}^{1 + V_{\\mathrm{off}}/V_s} \\frac{1}{u} \\, du\n$$\n$$\n= C_s V_s [\\ln|u|]_{1}^{1 + V_{\\mathrm{off}}/V_s} = C_s V_s \\left( \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{off}}}{V_s}\\right) - \\ln(1) \\right) = C_s V_s \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{off}}}{V_s}\\right)\n$$\nCombining both parts, the total charge to be removed is:\n$$\nQ_{\\mathrm{oss}} = C_f V_{\\mathrm{off}} + C_s V_s \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{off}}}{V_s}\\right)\n$$\nSince this charge is removed by a constant current $I_m$ over a time $t_d$, we have the simple relationship $Q_{\\mathrm{oss}} = I_m t_d$.

Thus, treating $I_m$ as constant is a valid approximation for determining the charge transfer requirement for ZVS.",

The amplitude of these peaks is given by $-\\exp(-\\alpha t_n) \\sqrt{1^2 + (\\alpha/\\omega_d)^2}$ multiplied by an initial amplitude factor, which simplifies.\nThe value of $\\cos(\\omega_d t)$ at the extrema is found from the relation $\\tan(\\theta) = -\\alpha/\\omega_d$. This forms a right triangle with opposite side $-\\alpha$, adjacent side $\\omega_d$, and hypotenuse $\\omega_0 = \\sqrt{\\alpha^2 + \\omega_d^2}$. The minima occur when $\\cos(\\omega_d t)$ is negative, so $\\cos(\\omega_d t_n) = -\\frac{\\omega_d}{\\omega_0}$.\nThe time of the $n$-th valley can be found as $t_n \\approx (2n-1)\\pi/\\omega_d$.\nThe voltage at the $n$-th valley is then approximated by evaluating the function at this time:\n$$v_{\\text{on}}(n) \\approx V_{\\text{off}} + \\hat{V}_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\alpha \\frac{(2n-1)\\pi}{\\omega_d}\\right)\\cos((2n-1)\\pi)$$\n$$v_{\\text{on}}(n) \\approx V_{\\text{off}} - \\hat{V}_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha}{\\omega_d}(2n-1)\\pi\\right)$$\nThis approximation is very accurate for lightly damped systems where $\\alpha \\ll \\omega_d$.\n\n**Part 2: Energy Saved**\n\nThe energy saved, $\\Delta E(n)$, is defined as the difference between the hard-switching energy and the valley-switching turn-on energy:\n$$\\Delta E(n) = E_{\\text{hard}} - E_{\\text{on}}(n) = \\frac{1}{2} C_{\\text{oss}} V_{\\text{off}}^{2} - \\frac{1}{2} C_{\\text{oss}} [v_{\\text{on}}(n)]^{2}$$\n$$\\Delta E(n) = \\frac{1}{2} C_{\\text{oss}} \\left( V_{\\text{off}}^{2} - [v_{\\text{on}}(n)]^{2} \\right)$$\n\n**Part 3: Numerical Computation for n=3**\n\nFirst, we compute the system parameters from the given values:\n$L_{r} = 2.00 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\text{H}$\n$C_{r} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{F}$\n$R_{\\text{eq}} = 2.00 \\times 10^{-1}\\ \\Omega$\n$V_{\\text{off}} = 4.00 \\times 10^{2}\\ \\text{V}$\n$\\hat{V}_{0} = 3.60 \\times 10^{2}\\ \\text{V}$\n$C_{\\text{oss}} = 6.00 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\text{F}$\n$n=3$\n\nCalculate $\\alpha$ and $\\omega_d$:\n$$\\alpha = \\frac{R_{\\text{eq}}}{2 L_{r}} = \\frac{0.200}{2 \\times 2.00 \\times 10^{-7}} = 5.00 \\times 10^{5}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$$\n$$\\omega_{0}^{2} = \\frac{1}{L_{r} C_{r}} = \\frac{1}{(2.00 \\times 10^{-7})(1.00 \\times 10^{-9})} = 5.00 \\times 10^{15}\\ \\text{(rad/s)}^2$$\n$$\\omega_{d} = \\sqrt{\\omega_{0}^{2} - \\alpha^{2}} = \\sqrt{5.00 \\times 10^{15} - (5.00 \\times 10^{5})^2} = \\sqrt{5.00 \\times 10^{15} - 2.50 \\times 10^{11}}$$\n$$\\omega_{d} = \\sqrt{4.99975 \\times 10^{15}} \\approx 7.07089104 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\text{rad/s}$$\n\nNow, compute $v_{\\text{on}}(3)$ using the derived approximation for $n=3$:\nFor $n=3$, the term $(2n-1)\\pi = 5\\pi$.\n$$v_{\\text{on}}(3) \\approx V_{\\text{off}} - \\hat{V}_{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha}{\\omega_d} 5\\pi\\right)$$\nCalculate the exponent:\n$$-\\frac{\\alpha}{\\omega_d} 5\\pi = -\\frac{5.00 \\times 10^5}{7.07089104 \\times 10^7} \\times 5\\pi \\approx -0.0070714 \\times 5\\pi \\approx -0.111072$$\nNow, substitute this into the expression for $v_{\\text{on}}(3)$:\n$$v_{\\text{on}}(3) \\approx 400 - 360 \\times \\exp(-0.111072)$$\n$$v_{\\text{on}}(3) \\approx 400 - 360 \\times 0.894886 \\approx 400 - 322.159 = 77.841\\ \\text{V}$$\n\nFinally, calculate the energy saved $\\Delta E(3)$:\n$$E_{\\text{hard}} = \\frac{1}{2} C_{\\text{oss}} V_{\\text{off}}^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} (6.00 \\times 10^{-10}) (400)^2 = 4.80 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{J}$$\n$$E_{\\text{on}}(3) = \\frac{1}{2} C_{\\text{oss}} [v_{\\text{on}}(3)]^{2} \\approx \\frac{1}{2} (6.00 \\times 10^{-10}) (77.841)^2 \\approx 1.8179 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{J}$$\n$$\\Delta E(3) = E_{\\text{hard}} - E_{\\text{on}}(3) \\approx 4.80 \\times 10^{-5} - 0.18179 \\times 10^{-5} = 4.61821 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{J}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\\Delta E(3) \\approx 4.618 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{J}$$",
