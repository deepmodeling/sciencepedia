            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of power electronics, specifically the operation of a Phase-Shifted Full-Bridge (PSFB) converter. The model for the voltage-dependent output capacitance of the MOSFET, $C_{\\mathrm{oss}}(v)$, is a standard and realistic representation. The core assumption that a constant magnetizing current is responsible for the discharge process during the dead-time is a well-established and reasonable approximation for analyzing Zero-Voltage Switching (ZVS) conditions, particularly when the magnetizing inductance is large. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and a clear objective.\n\nThe fundamental relationship between current $i(t)$, capacitance $C(v)$, and voltage $v(t)$ across the capacitor is given by:\n$$\ni(t) = C(v(t)) \\frac{dv(t)}{dt}\n$$\nIn this problem, a constant magnetizing current, which we will denote by the positive amplitude $I_m$, is discharging the MOSFET's output capacitance. Therefore, the current flowing out of the capacitor is $I_m$. This leads to a decrease in the voltage across it. The governing differential equation is:\n$$\nI_m = -C_{\\mathrm{oss}}(v) \\frac{dv}{dt}\n$$\nHere, $v$ is the drain-source voltage, and $C_{\\mathrm{oss}}(v)$ is the voltage-dependent output capacitance given by:\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{oss}}(v) = C_f + \\frac{C_s}{1 + v/V_s}\n$$\nWe need to find the minimal constant current $I_m$ that will discharge the capacitor from an initial voltage $V_{\\mathrm{off}}$ to $0$ V over a specified dead-time $t_d$. This means we need to find the value of $I_m$ such that $v(0) = V_{\\mathrm{off}}$ and $v(t_d) = 0$.\n\nWe can separate the variables in the differential equation to solve for the time required for the voltage to change:\n$$\ndt = -\\frac{1}{I_m} C_{\\mathrm{oss}}(v) \\, dv\n$$\nTo find the total dead-time $t_d$, we integrate this equation over the corresponding time and voltage intervals. The time $t$ spans from $0$ to $t_d$, while the voltage $v$ spans from $V_{\\mathrm{off}}$ to $0$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{t_d} dt = \\int_{V_{\\mathrm{off}}}^{0} -\\frac{1}{I_m} \\left( C_f + \\frac{C_s}{1 + v/V_s} \\right) dv\n$$\nSince $I_m$ is constant, we can take it out of the integral. We can also reverse the limits of integration for the voltage, which removes the negative sign:\n$$\nt_d = \\frac{1}{I_m} \\int_{0}^{V_{\\mathrm{off}}} \\left( C_f + \\frac{C_s}{1 + v/V_s} \\right) dv\n$$\nThe integral represents the total charge, $Q_{\\mathrm{oss}}$, that must be removed from the capacitor to reduce its voltage from $V_{\\mathrm{off}}$ to $0$. Let's evaluate this integral:\n$$\nQ_{\\mathrm{oss}} = \\int_{0}^{V_{\\mathrm{off}}} C_f \\, dv + \\int_{0}^{V_{\\mathrm{off}}} \\frac{C_s}{1 + v/V_s} \\, dv\n$$\nThe first part of the integral is straightforward:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{V_{\\mathrm{off}}} C_f \\, dv = C_f [v]_{0}^{V_{\\mathrm{off}}} = C_f V_{\\mathrm{off}}\n$$\nFor the second part, we perform a substitution. Let $u = 1 + v/V_s$. Then $du = (1/V_s) dv$, which means $dv = V_s du$. The limits of integration for $v$ from $0$ to $V_{\\mathrm{off}}$ correspond to limits for $u$ from $1$ to $1 + V_{\\mathrm{off}}/V_s$.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{V_{\\mathrm{off}}} \\frac{C_s}{1 + v/V_s} \\, dv = \\int_{1}^{1 + V_{\\mathrm{off}}/V_s} \\frac{C_s}{u} (V_s \\, du) = C_s V_s \\int_{1}^{1 + V_{\\mathrm{off}}/V_s} \\frac{1}{u} \\, du\n$$\n$$\n= C_s V_s [\\ln|u|]_{1}^{1 + V_{\\mathrm{off}}/V_s} = C_s V_s \\left( \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{off}}}{V_s}\\right) - \\ln(1) \\right) = C_s V_s \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{off}}}{V_s}\\right)\n$$\nCombining both parts, the total charge to be removed is:\n$$\nQ_{\\mathrm{oss}} = C_f V_{\\mathrm{off}} + C_s V_s \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{off}}}{V_s}\\right)\n$$\nSince this charge is removed by a constant current $I_m$ over a time $t_d$, we have the simple relationship $Q_{\\mathrm{oss}} = I_m t_d$.

While the voltage across the magnetizing inductor changes during the transition, the large inductance value typical in PSFB converters ensures that the current cannot change significantly in such a short time, i.e., $\\Delta I_m = \\frac{1}{L_m} \\int v_L(t) dt$ is small. Thus, treating $I_m$ as constant is a valid approximation for determining the charge transfer requirement for ZVS.",

The total parasitic resistance in this series path, which we shall denote as $R_{tank}$, is the sum of the inductor's winding resistance $R_{w}$ and the capacitor's ESR, $R_{\\mathrm{ESR},C_{r}}$.\n\n$$R_{tank} = R_{w} + R_{\\mathrm{ESR},C_{r}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$R_{tank} = 0.150\\,\\Omega + 0.030\\,\\Omega = 0.180\\,\\Omega$$\n\nThe current flowing through this series branch is stated to be the phasor sum of the in-phase (real-power) component, $I_{R}$, and the quadrature (magnetizing, reactive) component, $I_{m}$. In sinusoidal steady-state analysis, these two components are orthogonal. Therefore, the square of the total RMS magnitude of the series branch current, denoted $I_{s, \\text{RMS}}$, is the sum of the squares of the RMS magnitudes of its components.\n\n$$I_{s, \\text{RMS}}^2 = I_{R}^2 + I_{m}^2$$\nUsing the provided values:\n$$I_{s, \\text{RMS}}^2 = (3.80\\,\\mathrm{A})^2 + (4.60\\,\\mathrm{A})^2$$\n$$I_{s, \\text{RMS}}^2 = 14.44\\,\\mathrm{A}^2 + 21.16\\,\\mathrm{A}^2 = 35.6\\,\\mathrm{A}^2$$\nIt is preferable to use the value of $I_{s, \\text{RMS}}^2$ directly in the power calculation to avoid premature rounding.\n\nThe power loss in the resonant tank, $P_{loss, tank}$, is due to Joule heating in the total series resistance $R_{tank}$. According to the law of Joule heating, power dissipation is given by $P = I^2 R$.\n$$P_{loss, tank} = I_{s, \\text{RMS}}^2 \\times R_{tank}$$\nSubstituting the calculated values:\n$$P_{loss, tank} = (35.6\\,\\mathrm{A}^2) \\times (0.180\\,\\Omega) = 6.408\\,\\mathrm{W}$$\nThis is the total resonant tank resistive loss.\n\nTo find the efficiency, $\\eta$, we apply the principle of energy conservation. The total input power, $P_{in}$, must equal the sum of the useful output power, $P_{o}$, and all power losses. The problem states to assume all other losses are negligible, so the only loss is $P_{loss, tank}$.\n$$P_{in} = P_{o} + P_{loss, tank}$$\nGiven $P_{o} = 300\\,\\mathrm{W}$:\n$$P_{in} = 300\\,\\mathrm{W} + 6.408\\,\\mathrm{W} = 306.408\\,\\mathrm{W}$$\n\nEfficiency is defined as the ratio of output power to input power.\n$$\\eta = \\frac{P_{o}}{P_{in}}$$\n$$\\eta = \\frac{300\\,\\mathrm{W}}{306.408\\,\\mathrm{W}} \\approx 0.9790871$$\n\nThe problem requires the final efficiency to be expressed as a decimal number rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\eta \\approx 0.9791$$",
