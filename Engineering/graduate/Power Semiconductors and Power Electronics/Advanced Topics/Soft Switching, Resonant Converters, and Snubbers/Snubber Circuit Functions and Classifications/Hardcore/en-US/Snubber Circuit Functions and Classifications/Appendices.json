To suppress overshoot and damp the oscillation, a passive dissipative Resistive-Capacitive (RC) snubber is placed in series ($R_{\\text{sn}}$ in series with $C_{\\text{sn}}$) across the MOSFET. The snubber’s function is to absorb the inductive energy released at turn-off, shape the device voltage slew, and classify under passive dissipative voltage snubbers.\n\nAssume the MOSFET opens at $t=0^{+}$ while carrying current, so the loop reduces to the series combination of $L_{s}$ and the RC snubber branch. The branch current equals the inductor current, and the capacitor in the snubber charges toward the device voltage.

It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. Therefore, it is deemed **valid**.\n\n### Step 3: Proceed to Solution\n\nThe problem states that at the MOSFET turn-off, the effective circuit is a series combination of the stray inductance $L_{s}$, the snubber resistor $R_{\\text{sn}}$, and the snubber capacitor $C_{\\text{sn}}$. Let $i(t)$ be the current flowing in this series loop, and let $v_{C}(t)$ be the voltage across the capacitor $C_{\\text{sn}}$.\n\nAccording to Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL), the sum of the voltages around this closed loop must be zero:\n$$v_{L}(t) + v_{R}(t) + v_{C}(t) = 0$$\n\nWe use the provided constitutive relations for each component:\n- Voltage across the inductor: $v_{L}(t) = L_{s}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}i(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}$\n- Voltage across the resistor: $v_{R}(t) = R_{\\text{sn}}i(t)$\n- The current is related to the capacitor voltage by: $i(t) = C_{\\text{sn}}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{C}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}$\n\nTo obtain a differential equation in terms of a single variable, we express all terms using the capacitor voltage $v_{C}(t)$. First, we differentiate the capacitor current relation to find an expression for $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}i(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}$:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}i(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = C_{\\text{sn}}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2v_{C}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t^2}$$\n\nNow, substitute the relations for $i(t)$ and $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}i(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}$ into the KVL equation:\n$$L_{s}\\left(C_{\\text{sn}}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2v_{C}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t^2}\\right) + R_{\\text{sn}}\\left(C_{\\text{sn}}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{C}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\right) + v_{C}(t) = 0$$\n\nDividing by $L_{s}C_{\\text{sn}}$ places the equation in the standard form for a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2v_{C}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} + \\frac{R_{\\text{sn}}}{L_{s}}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{C}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{1}{L_{s}C_{\\text{sn}}}v_{C}(t) = 0$$\n\nThe general form of such an equation is:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2x(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t^2} + 2\\zeta\\omega_{n}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\omega_{n}^2 x(t) = 0$$\nwhere $\\omega_{n}$ is the natural angular frequency and $\\zeta$ is the damping ratio.\n\nBy comparing the coefficients of our derived equation with the standard form, we can identify $\\omega_{n}^2$ and $2\\zeta\\omega_{n}$:\n$$\\omega_{n}^2 = \\frac{1}{L_{s}C_{\\text{sn}}} \\implies \\omega_{n} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{L_{s}C_{\\text{sn}}}}$$\n$$2\\zeta\\omega_{n} = \\frac{R_{\\text{sn}}}{L_{s}}$$\n\nThe problem requires the condition for a critically damped response, where $\\zeta=1$. Substituting $\\zeta=1$ and the expression for $\\omega_{n}$ into the second identity gives:\n$$2(1)\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{L_{s}C_{\\text{sn}}}}\\right) = \\frac{R_{\\text{sn}}}{L_{s}}$$\n\nSolving for $R_{\\text{sn}}$ yields the required condition:\n$$R_{\\text{sn}} = \\frac{2L_{s}}{\\sqrt{L_{s}C_{\\text{sn}}}} = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{L_{s}^2}{L_{s}C_{\\text{sn}}}} = 2\\sqrt{\\frac{L_{s}}{C_{\\text{sn}}}}$$\nThis completes the first part of the task.\n\nNext, we are asked to estimate the energy dissipated in the snubber resistor per switching event. The problem states to assume the capacitor charges to the peak device voltage $V=400\\,\\text{V}$ and then fully discharges its stored energy into the resistor. The energy stored in a capacitor, $E_{\\text{diss}}$, is given by the formula:\n$$E_{\\text{diss}} = \\frac{1}{2}CV^2$$\n\nIn this context, $C$ is the snubber capacitance $C_{\\text{sn}}$, and $V$ is the peak voltage across it, which is given as $V=400\\,\\text{V}$. We are given the values:\n- $C_{\\text{sn}} = 1\\,\\text{nF} = 1 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{F}$\n- $V = 400\\,\\text{V}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the energy formula:\n$$E_{\\text{diss}} = \\frac{1}{2} (1 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{F}) (400\\,\\text{V})^2$$\n$$E_{\\text{diss}} = \\frac{1}{2} (1 \\times 10^{-9}) (160000)\\,\\text{J}$$\n$$E_{\\text{diss}} = \\frac{1}{2} (1 \\times 10^{-9}) (1.6 \\times 10^5)\\,\\text{J}$$\n$$E_{\\text{diss}} = 0.8 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{J} = 8 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{J}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer in microjoules ($\\mu\\text{J}$), where $1\\,\\mu\\text{J} = 10^{-6}\\,\\text{J}$.\n$$E_{\\text{diss}} = \\frac{8 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{J}}{10^{-6}\\,\\text{J}/\\mu\\text{J}} = 80\\,\\mu\\text{J}$$\n\nFinally, we must round this result to four significant figures.\n$$E_{\\text{diss}} = 80.00\\,\\mu\\text{J}$$\nThis is the final reported quantity.",

            "problem": "A resistive-capacitive-diode (RCD) clamp is a passive snubber used to absorb leakage inductance energy and limit overvoltage in switched power converters. Consider a simplified discrete-time energy-consistent model of an RCD clamp that captures its two principal functions: absorbing leakage energy and shaping clamp voltage ripple. The clamp is modeled as an ideal diode feeding a resistor-capacitor network with resistance $R$ and capacitance $C$. The energy source is the leakage inductance $L_{\\ell}$ of the transformer or inductor. At each switch turn-off event, the leakage current instantaneously reduces to zero, and the associated stored energy is transferred to the clamp. The energy per cycle delivered to the clamp is $E_{\\text{leak}} = \\tfrac{1}{2} L_{\\ell} I_{\\ell,\\text{pk}}^{2}$, where $I_{\\ell,\\text{pk}}$ is the leakage current at the moment of turn-off. The switching frequency is $f_{s}$, with switching period $T = 1/f_{s}$.\n\nAssume the following physically realistic approximations:\n- Energy injection from leakage inductance into the clamp occurs on a timescale much shorter than the resistor-capacitor time constant, so the energy increment can be modeled as an instantaneous increase in capacitor energy.\n- Between injections, the clamp capacitor discharges through the resistor according to first-order linear dynamics.\n\nDefine the per-cycle map using energy balance and first-order decay:\n- Let $v_{n}^{-}$ be the clamp capacitor voltage immediately before the $n$-th energy injection, and $v_{n}^{+}$ immediately after.\n- Energy increment condition:\n$$\\tfrac{1}{2} C \\left(v_{n}^{+}\\right)^{2} = \\tfrac{1}{2} C \\left(v_{n}^{-}\\right)^{2} + E_{\\text{leak}}.$$\n- Exponential decay over one period (no further injections during $T$):\n$$v_{n+1}^{-} = v_{n}^{+} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\tfrac{T}{R C}\\right).$$\n\nFrom these, all cycle-level quantities are determined.

            "solution": "The problem requires simulating an RCD clamp's behavior using a discrete-time energy-balance model. The core of the solution is to determine the clamp capacitor's voltage at steady state. Instead of iterating the per-cycle map, a more efficient and precise approach is to derive the analytical solution for the steady-state condition and implement it directly.\n\n### 1. Steady-State Principle\n\nThe system reaches a steady state when the energy absorbed by the clamp during each switching cycle equals the energy dissipated by its resistor during that same cycle.\n- **Energy Input:** The energy injected per cycle is constant: $E_{\\text{leak}} = \\frac{1}{2} L_{\\ell} I_{\\ell,\\text{pk}}^{2}$.\n- **Energy Dissipation:** The energy dissipated in the resistor over one cycle is equal to the net loss of energy stored in the capacitor from the cycle's beginning to its end.\n\n### 2. Analytical Derivation of Steady-State Voltages\n\nLet $v_{ss}^{+}$ be the capacitor voltage immediately after an energy injection in steady state, and $v_{ss}^{-}$ be the voltage just before the next injection.\n1.  **Energy Injection:** The capacitor's energy increases from its pre-injection level to its post-injection level:\n    $$\\frac{1}{2} C (v_{ss}^{+})^2 = \\frac{1}{2} C (v_{ss}^{-})^2 + E_{\\text{leak}}$$\n2.  **Voltage Decay:** Over the switching period $T$, the capacitor voltage decays exponentially through the resistor:\n    $$v_{ss}^{-} = v_{ss}^{+} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T}{RC}\\right)$$\n3.  **Solving for Peak Voltage:** We can solve for the steady-state peak voltage $v_{ss}^{+}$ by substituting the decay equation into the energy injection equation:\n    $$\\frac{1}{2} C (v_{ss}^{+})^2 = \\frac{1}{2} C \\left(v_{ss}^{+} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T}{RC}\\right)\\right)^2 + E_{\\text{leak}}$$\n    $$\\frac{1}{2} C (v_{ss}^{+})^2 \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2T}{RC}\\right)\\right) = E_{\\text{leak}}$$\n    This gives a closed-form solution for the square of the peak steady-state voltage:\n    $$(v_{ss}^{+})^2 = \\frac{2 E_{\\text{leak}} / C}{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2T}{RC}\\right)}$$\n\n### 3. Algorithmic Design\n\nThe program implements this analytical solution. For each test case:\n1.  Calculate initial parameters: switching period $T = 1/f_s$ and leakage energy $E_{\\text{leak}}$.\n2.  Handle the trivial case where $E_{\\text{leak}} = 0$. In this case, all voltages and powers are zero.\n3.  Calculate the steady-state peak voltage squared, $(v_{ss}^{+})^2$, using the derived formula. Then, take the square root to find $v_{ss}^{+}$.\n4.  Calculate the steady-state minimum voltage, $v_{ss}^{-} = v_{ss}^{+} \\exp(-T/RC)$.\n5.  With the steady-state voltages known, compute the required metrics:\n    *   **Simulated Power ($P_{R,\\text{sim}}$):** This is the energy dissipated per cycle multiplied by the switching frequency. The energy dissipated is exactly $E_{\\text{leak}}$ in steady state. Thus, $P_{R,\\text{sim}} = E_{\\text{leak}} f_s = P_{\\text{clamp}}$. The comparison should yield `True` within numerical tolerance.\n    *   **Average Voltage Power ($P_{\\text{avgV}}$):** First, calculate the time-averaged voltage $\\overline{v}$ over one decay period using the integral formula provided. Then, compute the naive power estimate as $P_{\\text{avgV}} = \\overline{v}^2 / R$.\n    *   **Voltage Ripple ($v_{\\text{pp}}$):** The peak-to-peak ripple is the difference between the maximum and minimum steady-state voltages: $v_{pp} = v_{ss}^{+} - v_{ss}^{-}$.\n    *   **Peak Voltage:** This is simply $v_{ss}^{+}$.\n6.  The relative errors are then calculated and all five metrics are compiled into the final output list for the test case. This approach bypasses numerical iteration, providing an exact and computationally efficient solution based on the model's fundamental principles.",

            "introduction": "Theoretical designs based on nominal component values often fall short in the real world due to manufacturing tolerances. This final practice introduces you to robust design, a critical skill for ensuring reliability and high production yields. Using Monte Carlo analysis, a powerful statistical simulation method, you will assess how component variations affect snubber performance, specifically peak voltage overshoot and power dissipation. This exercise will enable you to move beyond deterministic design and learn how to select component values that meet performance constraints with a specified statistical confidence, creating a product that is resilient to real-world imperfections .",

            "problem": "A power semiconductor switch exhibits high-frequency oscillations (ringing) at turn-off due to the interaction of parasitic inductance and junction capacitance. A Resistive–Capacitive (RC) snubber (series resistor and capacitor across the device) is one classification of snubber circuits whose functions include limiting the rate of change of voltage, damping underdamped oscillations, and reducing peak overvoltage. Consider the standard series inductor–resistor–capacitor loop that forms during the turn-off transient. The capacitor voltage, denoted $v_c(t)$, under a step in applied source voltage $v_s(t)$ is governed by the linear second-order differential equation\n$$\nL\\,C\\,\\frac{d^2 v_c(t)}{dt^2} + R\\,C\\,\\frac{dv_c(t)}{dt} + v_c(t) = v_s(t),\n$$\nwith the initial conditions $v_c(0) = 0$ and $\\frac{dv_c}{dt}(0) = 0$. Here $L$ is the effective loop inductance, $C$ is the total effective capacitance seen by the loop, and $R$ is the total effective series resistance. In the presence of a series RC snubber, the total effective capacitance is $C = C_j + C_s$, where $C_j$ is the device junction capacitance and $C_s$ is the snubber capacitor. The total effective series resistance is $R = R_{\\text{loop}} + R_s + R_{\\text{esr}}$, where $R_{\\text{loop}}$ is the loop resistance, $R_s$ is the snubber resistor, and $R_{\\text{esr}}$ is the equivalent series resistance of the capacitive elements. The input step is $v_s(t) = V_{\\text{bus}}\\,u(t)$, with $u(t)$ the unit step and $V_{\\text{bus}}$ the direct-current bus voltage.\n\nYou must implement a program that performs a Monte Carlo analysis of manufacturing tolerances to estimate the distribution of the peak ring amplitude and snubber power losses, and then selects robust snubber component values that satisfy specified constraints with at least $95\\%$ confidence. Treat each component tolerance as an independent uniform perturbation in the range $\\pm \\tau$ of its nominal value. The fundamental bases to be used are:\n- The standard second-order linear time-invariant system characterization via the natural frequency $\\omega_n$ and damping ratio $\\zeta$ derived from the coefficients of the above differential equation.\n- Energy conservation and capacitor energy $E_C = \\frac{1}{2} C V^2$ for computing event energies and average power with a known switching frequency.\n\nDefinitions and required computations:\n- For each Monte Carlo sample, draw the perturbed values of $L$, $C_j$, $R_{\\text{loop}}$, $R_{\\text{esr}}$, $R_s$, and $C_s$ from their respective uniform tolerance intervals about the nominal values.\n- Compute the total $C = C_j + C_s$ and total $R = R_{\\text{loop}} + R_s + R_{\\text{esr}}$.\n- From the second-order step response $v_c(t)$, determine the peak value $V_{\\text{peak}}$ of $v_c(t)$ and define the ring amplitude as $A = V_{\\text{peak}} - V_{\\text{bus}}$. Use physically consistent handling of underdamped and overdamped cases based on the damping ratio.\n- The snubber average power must include both the charge–discharge contribution of the snubber capacitor per cycle and the additional energy dissipated due to the transient ring decaying to the final value. Assume one dominant ring event per switching cycle. Express average power in watts.\n- Constraints to check per sample:\n  1. Peak voltage constraint: $V_{\\text{peak}} \\le V_{\\text{max}}$, where $V_{\\text{max}} = (1 + \\delta) V_{\\text{bus}}$.\n  2. Snubber power constraint: $P_{\\text{snub}} \\le P_{\\text{max}}$.\n- For a given candidate pair $(R_s, C_s)$, declare it robust if at least $0.95$ of the Monte Carlo samples satisfy both constraints simultaneously.\n\nUnits and outputs:\n- Express $V_{\\text{bus}}$ and all voltages in volts, inductance in henries, capacitance in farads, resistance in ohms, switching frequency in hertz, tolerance fractions as unitless decimals, and power in watts.\n- Your Monte Carlo must use $N$ samples per candidate, with $N \\ge 5000$.\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, with no whitespace. Each test case’s result must be a list of robust snubber pairs, and each pair must be listed as $[R_s,C_s]$ using decimal notation.

            "solution": "The task is to perform a Monte Carlo analysis to identify robust Resistive-Capacitive (RC) snubber designs for a power semiconductor switch. A design is robust if it satisfies constraints on peak voltage and snubber power dissipation with at least $95\\%$ confidence, considering manufacturing tolerances of all relevant components.\n\n### 1. System Modeling and Analysis\n\nThe physical system is modeled as a series RLC circuit, which forms during the switch turn-off transient. The voltage across the total capacitance, $v_c(t)$, is governed by the second-order linear differential equation:\n$$L\\,C\\,\\frac{d^2 v_c(t)}{dt^2} + R\\,C\\,\\frac{dv_c(t)}{dt} + v_c(t) = v_s(t)$$\nwhere $v_s(t) = V_{\\text{bus}}\\,u(t)$ is a step voltage input, and the initial conditions are $v_c(0)=0$ and $\\frac{dv_c}{dt}(0)=0$. The total resistance is $R = R_{\\text{loop}} + R_s + R_{\\text{esr}}$, and the total capacitance is $C = C_j + C_s$.\n\nThis equation can be normalized into the standard form for a second-order system:\n$$\\frac{d^2 v_c}{dt^2} + 2\\zeta\\omega_n \\frac{dv_c}{dt} + \\omega_n^2 v_c = \\omega_n^2 V_{\\text{bus}}$$\nwhere the natural frequency $\\omega_n$ and the damping ratio $\\zeta$ are defined as:\n$$\\omega_n = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{L C}}$$\n$$\\zeta = \\frac{R}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{C}{L}}$$\n\n### 2. Peak Voltage Calculation\n\nThe peak voltage, $V_{\\text{peak}}$, reached during the transient depends on the damping ratio $\\zeta$.\n- If the system is **underdamped** ($0 \\le \\zeta  1$), oscillations (ringing) occur. The peak voltage is the maximum overshoot of the step response. The solution to the differential equation for an underdamped system with the given initial conditions yields a peak voltage at time $t_{\\text{peak}} = \\pi / (\\omega_n \\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2})$. The value of this peak is:\n  $$V_{\\text{peak}} = V_{\\text{bus}} \\left( 1 + \\exp\\left(\\frac{-\\pi\\zeta}{\\sqrt{1-\\zeta^2}}\\right) \\right)$$\n- If the system is **critically damped** ($\\zeta = 1$) or **overdamped** ($\\zeta  1$), the voltage $v_c(t)$ approaches the final value $V_{\\text{bus}}$ monotonically without overshoot. In these cases, the peak voltage is simply the final steady-state voltage:\n  $$V_{\\text{peak}} = V_{\\text{bus}}$$\n\nThe first constraint is on this peak voltage: $V_{\\text{peak}} \\le V_{\\text{max}}$, where $V_{\\text{max}} = (1 + \\delta) V_{\\text{bus}}$.\n\n### 3. Snubber Power Dissipation\n\nThe average power dissipated in the snubber resistor, $P_{\\text{snub}}$, consists of two contributions per switching cycle.\n1.  **Turn-off Transient Dissipation**: During the turn-off charging transient, the total capacitance $C$ charges from $0$ to $V_{\\text{bus}}$. The total energy dissipated in the entire resistive loop ($R$) during this process is $W_{\\text{charge}} = \\frac{1}{2} C V_{\\text{bus}}^2$. This energy is distributed among the series resistors proportional to their resistance. The energy dissipated in the snubber resistor $R_s$ is $W_{\\text{charge}, R_s} = W_{\\text{charge}} \\frac{R_s}{R}$. The corresponding average power is $P_{\\text{charge}, R_s} = W_{\\text{charge}, R_s} f_{\\text{sw}}$.\n2.  **Turn-on Discharge Dissipation**: At turn-on, the energy stored in the snubber capacitor, $E_{C_s} = \\frac{1}{2} C_s V_{\\text{bus}}^2$, is dissipated. Assuming this dissipation primarily occurs in the snubber resistor $R_s$, this contributes an average power of $P_{\\text{discharge}} = E_{C_s} f_{\\text{sw}}$.\n\nThe total average power dissipated in the snubber resistor $R_s$ is the sum of these two components:\n$$P_{\\text{snub}} = P_{\\text{charge}, R_s} + P_{\\text{discharge}}$$\n$$P_{\\text{snub}} = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} C V_{\\text{bus}}^2 \\frac{R_s}{R} \\right) f_{\\text{sw}} + \\left( \\frac{1}{2} C_s V_{\\text{bus}}^2 \\right) f_{\\text{sw}}$$\nSubstituting $C = C_j + C_s$ and $R = R_{\\text{loop}} + R_s + R_{\\text{esr}}$, we get:\n$$P_{\\text{snub}} = \\frac{1}{2} f_{\\text{sw}} V_{\\text{bus}}^2 \\left( C_s + (C_j + C_s) \\frac{R_s}{R_{\\text{loop}} + R_s + R_{\\text{esr}}} \\right)$$\nThe second constraint is on this power: $P_{\\text{snub}} \\le P_{\\text{max}}$.\n\n### 4. Monte Carlo Simulation and Robustness\n\nTo account for manufacturing tolerances, a Monte Carlo simulation is employed. For each candidate snubber pair $(R_s, C_s)$:\n1.  A large number of trials ($N=8000$) is performed.\n2.  In each trial, a random value for each component ($L, C_j, R_{\\text{loop}}, R_{\\text{esr}}, R_s, C_s$) is drawn from a uniform distribution defined by its nominal value and tolerance $\\tau$. A component with nominal value $X_{nom}$ and tolerance $\\tau_X$ will have a perturbed value $X$ drawn from $U(X_{nom}(1-\\tau_X), X_{nom}(1+\\tau_X))$.\n3.  For each set of perturbed component values, the total resistance $R$ and capacitance $C$ are calculated.\n4.  The damping ratio $\\zeta$ and subsequently the peak voltage $V_{\\text{peak}}$ are determined.\n5.  The snubber power dissipation $P_{\\text{snub}}$ is calculated.\n6.  Both constraints, $V_{\\text{peak}} \\le V_{\\text{max}}$ and $P_{\\text{snub}} \\le P_{\\text{max}}$, are checked. A trial is a \"success\" if both are met.\n7.  After all trials, the success probability is estimated as the ratio of successful trials to the total number of trials $N$.\n8.  If this probability is $0.95$ or greater, the candidate pair $(R_s, C_s)$ is declared robust.\n\nThis procedure is repeated for all candidate pairs in each test case to identify the full set of robust solutions.",
