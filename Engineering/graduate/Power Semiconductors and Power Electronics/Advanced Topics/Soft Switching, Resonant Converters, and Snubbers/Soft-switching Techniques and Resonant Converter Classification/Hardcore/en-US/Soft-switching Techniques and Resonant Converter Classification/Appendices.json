Under a specified operating point (fixed direct current bus voltage and load current), the measured switching energy per event at turn-on is $E_{\\text{on}} = 112~\\mu\\text{J}$ and at turn-off is $E_{\\text{off}} = 94~\\mu\\text{J}$.

Then, in your explanation, comment on how $P_{\\text{sw}}$ scales with $f_{s}$ and briefly relate this scaling to the motivation for soft-switching and the role of resonant converter classification (for example, zero-voltage switching and a voltage-source series-resonant tank). Express the final power in watts and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the fundamental principles of power electronics, is well-posed with a complete and consistent set of givens, and is expressed in objective, formal language. The solution can therefore proceed.\n\nThe total average switching loss per device, $P_{\\text{sw}}$, is the total energy dissipated due to switching events over one switching cycle, multiplied by the frequency of these cycles. In a hard-switched pulse-width modulation (PWM) converter, a switching device typically experiences a turn-on event and a turn-off event once per switching cycle.\n\nThe fundamental definition of average power, $P$, relates energy, $E$, and time, $t$, as $P = \\frac{E}{t}$. For a periodic process with a frequency $f_s$, the period is $T_s = \\frac{1}{f_s}$. The average power is the energy per cycle, $E_{\\text{cycle}}$, multiplied by the frequency:\n$$P = E_{\\text{cycle}} \\times f_s$$\nIn this case, the total energy dissipated due to switching in one cycle, $E_{\\text{sw,cycle}}$, is the sum of the energy lost during the turn-on event, $E_{\\text{on}}$, and the energy lost during the turn-off event, $E_{\\text{off}}$.\n$$E_{\\text{sw,cycle}} = E_{\\text{on}} + E_{\\text{off}}$$\nTherefore, the total average switching loss per device, $P_{\\text{sw}}$, is derived by substituting this into the power equation:\n$$P_{\\text{sw}} = (E_{\\text{on}} + E_{\\text{off}}) \\times f_{s}$$\nThis equation represents the direct relationship between switching energy per event, switching frequency, and average switching power loss.\n\nThe problem provides the following numerical values:\n- Turn-on switching energy: $E_{\\text{on}} = 112~\\mu\\text{J} = 112 \\times 10^{-6}~\\text{J}$\n- Turn-off switching energy: $E_{\\text{off}} = 94~\\mu\\text{J} = 94 \\times 10^{-6}~\\text{J}$\n- Switching frequency: $f_{s} = 230~\\text{kHz} = 230 \\times 10^{3}~\\text{Hz}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the total switching energy per cycle, $E_{\\text{sw,cycle}}$:\n$$E_{\\text{sw,cycle}} = (112 \\times 10^{-6}~\\text{J}) + (94 \\times 10^{-6}~\\text{J}) = 206 \\times 10^{-6}~\\text{J}$$\nNext, we use this value to compute the total average switching loss, $P_{\\text{sw}}$:\n$$P_{\\text{sw}} = (206 \\times 10^{-6}~\\text{J}) \\times (230 \\times 10^{3}~\\text{s}^{-1})$$\n$$P_{\\text{sw}} = 47380 \\times 10^{-3}~\\text{W}$$\n$$P_{\\text{sw}} = 47.38~\\text{W}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in watts and rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $47.38~\\text{W}$, which already has four significant figures.\n\nAs derived, $P_{\\text{sw}} = (E_{\\text{on}} + E_{\\text{off}}) f_{s}$. This relationship shows that for a given operating point (fixed bus voltage and load current), where $E_{\\text{on}}$ and $E_{\\text{off}}$ are nearly constant, the switching loss $P_{\\text{sw}}$ scales linearly with the switching frequency $f_{s}$. This direct proportionality is a defining characteristic and a major limitation of hard-switched converters. Increasing $f_{s}$ to achieve higher power density and reduce the size of magnetic components and capacitors inevitably leads to a proportional increase in switching losses, which degrades efficiency and creates significant thermal management challenges.\n\nThis limitation is the primary motivation for soft-switching techniques. These techniques aim to drastically reduce or eliminate switching losses by arranging for either the voltage across the device (for zero-voltage switching, or ZVS) or the current through the device (for zero-current switching, or ZCS) to be zero at the moment of switching. Resonant converters are a class of topologies that inherently facilitate soft-switching. For instance, a voltage-source series-resonant converter employs an inductor-capacitor ($LC$) resonant tank to shape the device voltage and current into sinusoids. By timing the switching action to coincide with the zero-crossings of these waveforms, ZVS can be achieved. Achieving ZVS at turn-on, for example, makes the turn-on switching energy $E_{\\text{on}}$ negligible ($E_{\\text{on}} \\approx 0$). This breaks the detrimental linear scaling of $P_{\\text{sw}}$ with $f_{s}$, thereby permitting operation at much higher frequencies with high efficiency. The classification of resonant converters (e.g., series-resonant, voltage-source) provides engineers with a systematic framework for designing power stages that achieve specific soft-switching characteristics.",

A solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Homogeneous Differential Equation**\nFor the series circuit containing the resistor $R$, inductor $L_r$, and capacitor $C_r$, a single current $i(t)$ flows through all components. Applying Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) to the unforced (homogeneous) circuit loop, the sum of the voltages across each component is zero:\n$$v_R(t) + v_L(t) + v_C(t) = 0$$\nThe voltage across the resistor is $v_R(t) = R i(t)$. The voltage across the inductor is given as $v_L(t) = L_r \\frac{di(t)}{dt}$. The voltage across the capacitor is $v_C(t)$. Substituting these into the KVL equation yields:\n$$R i(t) + L_r \\frac{di(t)}{dt} + v_C(t) = 0$$\nTo obtain a differential equation solely in terms of the current $i(t)$, we can differentiate the entire equation with respect to time $t$:\n$$R \\frac{di(t)}{dt} + L_r \\frac{d^2i(t)}{dt^2} + \\frac{dv_C(t)}{dt} = 0$$\nThe current flowing through the capacitor is given by $i_C(t) = C_r \\frac{dv_C(t)}{dt}$. Since it is a series circuit, $i(t) = i_C(t)$. Therefore, we can express the rate of change of capacitor voltage as:\n$$\\frac{dv_C(t)}{dt} = \\frac{i(t)}{C_r}$$\nSubstituting this expression back into the differentiated KVL equation gives:\n$$L_r \\frac{d^2i(t)}{dt^2} + R \\frac{di(t)}{dt} + \\frac{1}{C_r} i(t) = 0$$\nThis is the homogeneous second-order linear differential equation governing the tank current $i(t)$.\n\n**Normalized Form and Parameter Identification**\nTo find the characteristic parameters, we normalize the equation by dividing by the inductance $L_r$:\n$$\\frac{d^2i(t)}{dt^2} + \\frac{R}{L_r} \\frac{di(t)}{dt} + \\frac{1}{L_r C_r} i(t) = 0$$\nThis equation is in the standard form for a second-order linear system:\n$$\\frac{d^2x(t)}{dt^2} + 2\\zeta\\omega_0 \\frac{dx(t)}{dt} + \\omega_0^2 x(t) = 0$$\nBy comparing the coefficients of the two equations, we identify the undamped natural angular frequency $\\omega_0$ and the damping ratio $\\zeta$.\nThe squared undamped natural angular frequency is:\n$$\\omega_0^2 = \\frac{1}{L_r C_r} \\implies \\omega_0 = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{L_r C_r}}$$\nThe term related to damping is:\n$$2\\zeta\\omega_0 = \\frac{R}{L_r}$$\nSolving for the damping ratio $\\zeta$:\n$$\\zeta = \\frac{R}{2L_r \\omega_0} = \\frac{R}{2L_r} \\left(\\sqrt{L_r C_r}\\right) = \\frac{R}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{C_r}{L_r}}$$\n\n**Resonant Frequency and Quality Factor**\nThe resonant frequency, denoted here as $f_r$, is the undamped natural frequency expressed in Hertz. It is related to $\\omega_0$ by:\n$$f_r = \\frac{\\omega_0}{2\\pi} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sqrt{L_r C_r}}$$\nThe quality factor, $Q$, of a series RLC circuit is a measure of its damping. It is defined as the ratio of the reactive power in the inductor (or capacitor) at resonance to the average power dissipated in the resistor. A common definition is:\n$$Q = \\frac{\\omega_0 L_r}{R}$$\nThe quality factor is inversely related to the damping ratio:\n$$Q = \\frac{1}{2\\zeta}$$\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\nThe given component values are:\n$L_r = 10 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{H} = 10 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{H}$\n$C_r = 100 \\ \\mathrm{nF} = 100 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{F} = 1 \\times 10^{-7} \\ \\mathrm{F}$\n$R = 10 \\ \\Omega$\n\nFirst, we calculate the resonant frequency $f_r$:\n$$f_r = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sqrt{(10 \\times 10^{-6})(100 \\times 10^{-9})}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sqrt{1 \\times 10^{-12}}} = \\frac{10^6}{2\\pi} \\ \\mathrm{Hz}$$\n$$f_r \\approx 159154.943 \\ \\mathrm{Hz} = 159.154943 \\ \\mathrm{kHz}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $f_r = 159.2 \\ \\mathrm{kHz}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the quality factor $Q$:\n$$Q = \\frac{1}{R}\\sqrt{\\frac{L_r}{C_r}} = \\frac{1}{10}\\sqrt{\\frac{10 \\times 10^{-6}}{100 \\times 10^{-9}}} = \\frac{1}{10}\\sqrt{\\frac{10^{-5}}{10^{-7}}} = \\frac{1}{10}\\sqrt{100} = \\frac{10}{10} = 1$$\nThe value is exactly $1$. Expressed to four significant figures, $Q = 1.000$.\n\n**Damping Classification**\nThe type of natural response (underdamped, critically damped, or overdamped) is determined by the value of the damping ratio $\\zeta$.\n- If $\\zeta < 1$, the system is underdamped.\n- If $\\zeta = 1$, the system is critically damped.\n- If $\\zeta > 1$, the system is overdamped.\nWe can calculate $\\zeta$ from $Q$:\n$$\\zeta = \\frac{1}{2Q} = \\frac{1}{2(1)} = 0.5$$\nSince $\\zeta = 0.5 < 1$, the tank's natural response is underdamped.\nAccording to the problem's encoding scheme, $u=1$ for an underdamped system.\n\n**Final Answer Assembly**\nThe required output is a row vector $[f_r, Q, u]$.\n- $f_r = 159.2$\n- $Q = 1.000$\n- $u = 1$\nThe final vector is $[159.2, 1.000, 1]$.",

The RMS value of a symmetric triangular wave with peak amplitude $I_{\\text{peak}}$ is given by:\n$$ I_{\\text{rms}} = \\frac{I_{\\text{peak}}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{I_{\\text{m,min}}}{\\sqrt{3}} $$\nUsing the unrounded value of $I_{\\text{m,min}}$:\n$$ I_{\\text{rms}} = \\frac{0.4018875 \\, \\text{A}}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 0.232021 \\, \\text{A} $$\nNow, we can compute the circulating apparent power:\n$$ S_{\\text{circ}} = V_{\\text{rms}} I_{\\text{rms}} = \\left( \\frac{V_{\\text{bus}}}{2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{I_{\\text{m,min}}}{\\sqrt{3}} \\right) = \\frac{V_{\\text{bus}} I_{\\text{m,min}}}{2\\sqrt{3}} $$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$ S_{\\text{circ}} = (200 \\, \\text{V}) \\times (0.232021 \\, \\text{A}) \\approx 46.4042 \\, \\text{VA} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, $S_{\\text{circ}} = 46.40 \\, \\text{VA}$.",
