            "problem": "Consider a single-phase cascaded H-bridge inverter comprising $s$ H-bridge cells connected in series. The $i$-th H-bridge has an independent direct-current source of magnitude $V_{i}  0$. Assume ideal switching devices and negligible parasitics. The output voltage waveform $v(\\theta)$ over an electrical angle $\\theta$ is designed to exhibit half-wave symmetry, i.e., $v(\\theta + \\pi) = -v(\\theta)$, and quarter-wave symmetry, i.e., $v(\\pi - \\theta) = v(\\theta)$ for $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi]$, with a stepped structure in the first quadrant constructed as follows.\n\nIn the first quadrant $\\theta \\in [0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]$, each cell transitions from $0$ to $+V_{i}$ at a unique switching angle $\\alpha_{i} \\in (0, \\frac{\\pi}{2})$, with strict ordering $0  \\alpha_{1}  \\alpha_{2}  \\cdots  \\alpha_{s}  \\frac{\\pi}{2}$. Consequently, the waveform is piecewise constant on subintervals, taking the values $0$ on $[0, \\alpha_{1})$, $V_{1}$ on $[\\alpha_{1}, \\alpha_{2})$, $V_{1}+V_{2}$ on $[\\alpha_{2}, \\alpha_{3})$, and so on, up to $\\sum_{i=1}^{s} V_{i}$ on $[\\alpha_{s}, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]$. The remainder of the period is completed by symmetry under the stated half-wave and quarter-wave conditions, resulting in an odd function with only sine harmonics.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definition of the Fourier series for a real, $2\\pi$-periodic signal and exploiting the stated symmetries, derive the expressions for the Fourier coefficients $a_{n}$ and $b_{n}$ of $v(\\theta)$ in terms of the level voltages $\\{V_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{s}$ and the switching angles $\\{\\alpha_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{s}$. Then, express the amplitude $V_{1}$ of the fundamental component (the coefficient of $\\sin(\\theta)$) as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $\\{V_{i}\\}$ and $\\{\\alpha_{i}\\}$.\n\nAll angles $\\alpha_{i}$ must be treated in radians. Express your final formula symbolically; do not perform any numerical evaluation.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the Fourier series coefficients for a specified multilevel voltage waveform and, subsequently, the amplitude of the fundamental component.\n\nFirst, let us address the notation. The problem uses the symbol $V_{i}$ to denote the DC voltage of the $i$-th H-bridge cell. It then requests the amplitude of the fundamental component, which it also names $V_{1}$. This creates a potential ambiguity between the amplitude of the fundamental harmonic and the DC voltage of the first cell ($V_{1}$). Based on the phrasing \"express the amplitude $V_{1}$ ... in terms of $\\{V_{i}\\}$\", it is clear that the fundamental amplitude is the quantity to be derived, while the set of cell voltages $\\{V_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{s}$ are given parameters. We shall proceed under this interpretation, deriving the expression for the fundamental amplitude, which the problem designates as $V_{1}$.\n\nThe Fourier series representation of a $2\\pi$-periodic function $v(\\theta)$ is given by:\n$$v(\\theta) = a_{0} + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\left( a_{n} \\cos(n\\theta) + b_{n} \\sin(n\\theta) \\right)$$\nwhere the coefficients are defined by the Euler formulas:\n$$a_{0} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} v(\\theta) \\, d\\theta$$\n$$a_{n} = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} v(\\theta) \\cos(n\\theta) \\, d\\theta \\quad \\text{for } n \\ge 1$$\n$$b_{n} = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} v(\\theta) \\sin(n\\theta) \\, d\\theta \\quad \\text{for } n \\ge 1$$\n\nThe problem states that the waveform $v(\\theta)$ possesses specific symmetries, which can be used to simplify the calculation of these coefficients.\n1.  **Half-wave symmetry**: $v(\\theta + \\pi) = -v(\\theta)$. This property implies that the waveform contains no even harmonics. Consequently, $a_{n} = 0$ and $b_{n} = 0$ for all even values of $n$. Furthermore, the DC component $a_{0}$ is also zero. For odd $n$, the integrals simplify.\n2.  **Quarter-wave symmetry**: The problem defines this as $v(\\pi - \\theta) = v(\\theta)$ for $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi]$, which means the waveform is symmetric about $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ over the first half-period. This, combined with half-wave symmetry, implies the waveform is odd, i.e., $v(-\\theta) = -v(\\theta)$. For an odd function, the product $v(\\theta)\\cos(n\\theta)$ is odd, and its integral over a symmetric interval like $[-\\pi, \\pi]$ is zero. Therefore, all cosine coefficients are zero:\n$$a_{n} = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } n \\ge 0$$\nFor the sine coefficients $b_{n}$, the integrand $v(\\theta)\\sin(n\\theta)$ is an even function, which simplifies its integral. The combination of half-wave and quarter-wave symmetry allows the integral over a full period to be expressed as four times the integral over the first quarter-period:\n$$b_{n} = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} v(\\theta) \\sin(n\\theta) \\, d\\theta$$\nThis expression is valid only for odd values of $n$, as $b_n = 0$ for even $n$.\n\nNext, we must evaluate this integral using the specified structure of $v(\\theta)$ in the first quadrant, $\\theta \\in [0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]$. The voltage waveform is a stepped function, which can be expressed as a sum of step-up transitions at each switching angle $\\alpha_{i}$. A convenient way to represent this is using the Heaviside step function, $H(\\theta)$, where $H(\\theta) = 1$ for $\\theta \\ge 0$ and $H(\\theta) = 0$ for $\\theta  0$. The voltage level increases by $V_{i}$ at the angle $\\alpha_{i}$. Thus, for $\\theta \\in [0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]$, the waveform can be written as:\n$$v(\\theta) = \\sum_{i=1}^{s} V_{i} H(\\theta - \\alpha_{i})$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $b_{n}$:\n$$b_{n} = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{s} V_{i} H(\\theta - \\alpha_{i}) \\right) \\sin(n\\theta) \\, d\\theta$$\nSince the sum is finite, we can interchange the summation and integration:\n$$b_{n} = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\sum_{i=1}^{s} V_{i} \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} H(\\theta - \\alpha_{i}) \\sin(n\\theta) \\, d\\theta$$\nThe Heaviside function $H(\\theta - \\alpha_{i})$ is zero for $\\theta  \\alpha_{i}$ and one for $\\theta \\ge \\alpha_{i}$. This changes the lower limit of each integral from $0$ to $\\alpha_{i}$:\n$$b_{n} = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\sum_{i=1}^{s} V_{i} \\int_{\\alpha_{i}}^{\\pi/2} \\sin(n\\theta) \\, d\\theta$$\nWe now perform the integration:\n$$\\int_{\\alpha_{i}}^{\\pi/2} \\sin(n\\theta) \\, d\\theta = \\left[ -\\frac{1}{n} \\cos(n\\theta) \\right]_{\\alpha_{i}}^{\\pi/2} = -\\frac{1}{n} \\cos\\left(\\frac{n\\pi}{2}\\right) + \\frac{1}{n} \\cos(n\\alpha_{i})$$\nAs established, this expression for $b_n$ is non-zero only for odd integers $n$. For any odd integer $n$, $\\cos(\\frac{n\\pi}{2}) = 0$. Therefore, the integral simplifies to:\n$$\\int_{\\alpha_{i}}^{\\pi/2} \\sin(n\\theta) \\, d\\theta = \\frac{1}{n} \\cos(n\\alpha_{i})$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $b_{n}$:\n$$b_{n} = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\sum_{i=1}^{s} V_{i} \\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\cos(n\\alpha_{i}) \\right)$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$b_{n} = \\frac{4}{n\\pi} \\sum_{i=1}^{s} V_{i} \\cos(n\\alpha_{i})$$\n\nTo summarize the Fourier coefficients:\n- $a_{n} = 0$ for all $n \\ge 0$.\n- $b_{n} = 0$ for all even $n$.\n- $b_{n} = \\frac{4}{n\\pi} \\sum_{i=1}^{s} V_{i} \\cos(n\\alpha_{i})$ for all odd $n$.\n\nThe final step is to find the amplitude of the fundamental component. The fundamental component is the term in the Fourier series corresponding to $n=1$. Its amplitude is given by the coefficient $b_{1}$. According to the problem's notation, this amplitude is denoted by $V_{1}$. Setting $n=1$ in our derived expression for $b_{n}$:\n$$V_{1} \\equiv b_{1} = \\frac{4}{1 \\cdot \\pi} \\sum_{i=1}^{s} V_{i} \\cos(1 \\cdot \\alpha_{i})$$\n$$V_{1} = \\frac{4}{\\pi} \\sum_{i=1}^{s} V_{i} \\cos(\\alpha_{i})$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the amplitude of the fundamental harmonic in terms of the DC voltage levels $\\{V_i\\}$ and the switching angles $\\{\\alpha_i\\}$.",

Substituting this into the expression for $\\mathbb{E}[(\\Delta V_m)^2]$ collapses the double summation to a single sum (for $j=k$):\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[(\\Delta V_m)^2] = \\left(\\frac{64V_{\\mathrm{dc}}^2}{\\pi^2}\\right) \\sum_{k=1}^N (-1)^{2k} \\sin^2(m\\alpha_k) \\left(\\frac{\\omega_0^2 (\\Delta t)^2}{12}\\right)\n$$\nSince $(-1)^{2k}=1$, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[(\\Delta V_m)^2] = \\frac{64V_{\\mathrm{dc}}^2 \\omega_0^2 (\\Delta t)^2}{12\\pi^2} \\sum_{k=1}^N \\sin^2(m\\alpha_k) = \\frac{16V_{\\mathrm{dc}}^2 \\omega_0^2 (\\Delta t)^2}{3\\pi^2} \\sum_{k=1}^N \\sin^2(m\\alpha_k)\n$$\nFinally, we compute the required quantity by summing over all harmonics $m$ in the set $\\mathcal{S}=\\{1\\}\\cup\\mathcal{H}$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\sum_{m\\in\\mathcal{S}}\\left(\\Delta V_{m}\\right)^{2}\\right] = \\sum_{m\\in\\mathcal{S}} \\mathbb{E}[(\\Delta V_m)^2] = \\sum_{m\\in\\mathcal{S}} \\left( \\frac{16V_{\\mathrm{dc}}^2 \\omega_0^2 (\\Delta t)^2}{3\\pi^2} \\sum_{k=1}^N \\sin^2(m\\alpha_k) \\right)\n$$\nThe constant factor can be pulled out of the summation over $m$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\sum_{m\\in\\mathcal{S}}\\left(\\Delta V_{m}\\right)^{2}\\right] = \\frac{16V_{\\mathrm{dc}}^2 \\omega_0^2 (\\Delta t)^2}{3\\pi^2} \\sum_{m\\in\\mathcal{S}} \\sum_{k=1}^N \\sin^2(m\\alpha_k)\n$$\nWe can swap the order of the finite summations:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\sum_{m\\in\\mathcal{S}}\\left(\\Delta V_{m}\\right)^{2}\\right] = \\frac{16V_{\\mathrm{dc}}^2 \\omega_0^2 (\\Delta t)^2}{3\\pi^2} \\sum_{k=1}^N \\sum_{m\\in\\mathcal{S}} \\sin^2(m\\alpha_k)\n$$\nThe problem asks for the result in terms of $T$ instead of $\\omega_0$.
