            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It provides a realistic scenario for comparing the surge performance of SiC Schottky and JBS diodes. All necessary parameters for a first-principles analysis are provided.\n\nWe begin by calculating key physical parameters from the given data.\n\n1.  **Hole Diffusion Coefficient ($D_p$)**: We use the Einstein relation, $D_p = \\mu_p V_T$, where $V_T = \\frac{k_B T}{q}$ is the thermal voltage.\n    At $T = 300 \\ \\mathrm{K}$, the thermal voltage is $V_T = (1.3806 \\times 10^{-23} \\ \\mathrm{J/K} \\times 300 \\ \\mathrm{K}) / (1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\ \\mathrm{C}) \\approx 0.02585 \\ \\mathrm{V}$.\n    The hole diffusion coefficient is then:\n    $$ D_p = \\mu_p V_T = (115 \\ \\mathrm{cm^2/(V \\cdot s)}) \\times (0.02585 \\ \\mathrm{V}) \\approx 2.973 \\ \\mathrm{cm^2/s} $$\n\n2.  **Hole Diffusion Length ($L_p$)**: The diffusion length is given by $L_p = \\sqrt{D_p \\tau_p}$.\n    Using the given minority carrier lifetime $\\tau_p = 0.5 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{s} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{s}$:\n    $$ L_p = \\sqrt{(2.973 \\ \\mathrm{cm^2/s}) \\times (0.5 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{s})} = \\sqrt{1.4865 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{cm^2}} \\approx 1.219 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{cm} $$\n    Converting to micrometers, $L_p \\approx 12.2 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n\n3.  **JBS Geometry**: The stripe pitch is $s = 20 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$, so the half-pitch is $s/2 = 10 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n    Comparing the diffusion length to the half-pitch: $L_p \\approx 12.2 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m} > s/2 = 10 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$. This is a critical result for evaluating the extent of conductivity modulation.\n\nNow, we will analyze each statement in detail.\n\n**A. In the JBS diode, the hole diffusion length $L_p$ exceeds the stripe half-pitch $s/2$, and the near-stripe excess hole density $\\Delta p(0)$ during the surge can greatly exceed $N_D$, so the local drift-layer conductivity under the $p^+$ stripes is substantially modulated. This reduces $J^2 \\rho$ heating and current crowding relative to the pure Schottky diode, enhancing surge capability.**\n\n-   **Diffusion Length vs. Half-Pitch**: As calculated above, $L_p \\approx 12.2 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$ and $s/2 = 10 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$. The statement that $L_p$ exceeds $s/2$ is correct. This implies that the plasma of injected carriers (holes and electrons) from adjacent $p^+$ stripes can merge in the channel between them, enabling conductivity modulation across the entire active area.\n-   **Excess Carrier Density**: A surge current density of $J_{\\text{peak}} = 300 \\ \\mathrm{A/cm^2}$ requires the $p^+/n$ junction of the JBS to be strongly forward-biased (anode potential of several volts). Under such conditions in a SiC PIN structure, the injected minority carrier density $\\Delta p$ at the junction must be in the high-injection regime, meaning $\\Delta p \\gg N_D$. For $N_D = 5 \\times 10^{15} \\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$, it is certain that $\\Delta p$ will be one or more orders of magnitude higher.\n-   **Conductivity Modulation and Surge Capability**: With $\\Delta p \\approx \\Delta n \\gg N_D$, the drift layer's conductivity transitions from $\\sigma_0 = q \\mu_n N_D$ to approximately $\\sigma_{\\text{mod}} \\approx q(\\mu_n + \\mu_p)\\Delta n$. This is a significant increase, which drastically reduces resistivity $\\rho$. The power dissipated as heat, given by $P = J^2 \\rho$, is therefore substantially lowered. This conductivity modulation alleviates the geometric current crowding that occurs at low biases in the channels between the $p^+$ stripes and prevents thermally-induced current filamentation, thereby enhancing the overall surge current handling capability of the device compared to a purely unipolar Schottky diode.\n-   **Verdict**: The statement provides a complete and physically accurate description of the JBS diode's behavior under surge conditions, supported by our calculations. **Correct**.\n\n**B. In the pure Schottky diode, minority carrier injection is negligible; the drift-layer conductivity remains approximately $\\sigma \\approx q \\mu_n N_D$ during the surge. Current crowding near the Schottky contact edges is more severe than in the JBS diode, yielding lower surge current handling.**\n\n-   **Conductivity**: The problem statement specifies that the pure Schottky diode has negligible minority carrier injection. Therefore, its drift layer is unmodulated, and its conductivity is fixed at $\\sigma \\approx q \\mu_n N_D$ (ignoring second-order effects like mobility dependence on temperature and field).\n-   **Current Crowding**: This part is subtly phrased. Geometrically, the JBS diode *introduces* current crowding at low currents by forcing current into channels between the $p^+$ regions. However, under a high surge, the JBS's conductivity modulation *eliminates* this crowding. In contrast, the unipolar Schottky, with its higher and non-decreasing resistance, is susceptible to thermo-electric instability. The higher power dissipation ($J^2\\rho$) can lead to localized heating. Since resistivity in SiC increases with temperature, this positive feedback can cause current to constrict into cooler filaments, a phenomenon also describable as \"current crowding\". In this context, the JBS is more stable and less prone to this failure mode.\n-   **Surge Handling**: Because the Schottky diode lacks the conductivity modulation mechanism, its drift resistance remains high during the surge. This results in significantly higher power dissipation and temperature rise for a given current density compared to the JBS diode. Consequently, its ability to handle surge currents is lower.\n-   **Verdict**: The reasoning regarding conductivity and the conclusion about lower surge handling are correct. Interpreting \"current crowding\" as thermally-induced filamentation, a key failure mode in unipolar devices, makes the entire statement physically sound. **Correct**.\n\n**C. Because the $p^+$ stripes inject holes, the JBS diode invariably exhibits hard reverse recovery comparable to a silicon $p$–$n$ diode after any surge, making its surge handling worse than the pure Schottky diode.**\n\n-   **Reverse Recovery**: The injection of minority carriers during the surge means there is stored charge in the drift region. This charge must be removed or recombine when the diode is reverse-biased, leading to a reverse recovery current. This part of the statement is true.\n-   **Comparison with Silicon**: The statement claims recovery is \"comparable to a silicon $p-n$ diode\". This is incorrect. The given minority carrier lifetime in SiC is $\\tau_p = 0.5 \\ \\mu \\mathrm{s}$, which is much shorter than in typical power Si PIN diodes (often $10-100$ times longer). Consequently, the stored charge ($Q_{rr}$) in a SiC bipolar device is much smaller, and the recovery is significantly faster and \"softer\" (lower peak reverse current).\n-   **Effect on Surge Handling**: The conclusion that reverse recovery makes the surge handling *worse* is fundamentally flawed. The bipolar injection that causes recovery is the very mechanism that provides the low on-state resistance needed to *survive* the forward surge. The JBS design deliberately trades ideal Schottky-like recovery for superior forward surge capability.\n-   **Verdict**: The statement contains an inaccurate comparison and a completely incorrect conclusion regarding the physics of surge survival. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Local conductivity modulation in the JBS diode is negligible during the surge because the minority carrier diffusion length $L_p$ is much smaller than the stripe half-pitch $s/2$, preventing overlap of injected charge between adjacent $p^+$ stripes.**\n\n-   **Premise vs. Calculation**: The central premise of this statement is that $L_p \\ll s/2$. Our calculation in the prelude showed the opposite: $L_p \\approx 12.2 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$ is *greater than* $s/2 = 10 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}$. Therefore, the physical premise of the statement is factually incorrect based on the problem data.\n-   **Conclusion**: Since the premise is false, the conclusion drawn from it—that conductivity modulation is negligible due to lack of plasma overlap—is also false. In fact, because $L_p > s/2$, significant plasma overlap and strong conductivity modulation are expected.\n-   **Verdict**: The statement is based on a false premise. **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. The excess carrier density required to reduce the drift-region resistivity by a factor of $2$ under the $p^+$ stripes is $\\Delta n \\approx \\mu_n N_D/(\\mu_n + \\mu_p)$; under the stated parameters this required $\\Delta n$ is less than the estimated $\\Delta p(0)$ during the surge, so halving of resistivity is plausible locally in a JBS diode.**\n\n-   **Derivation**: Let's verify the formula. The initial conductivity is $\\sigma_0 = q \\mu_n N_D$. The modulated conductivity, assuming charge neutrality ($\\Delta n = \\Delta p$), is $\\sigma_{\\text{mod}} = q[\\mu_n(N_D+\\Delta n) + \\mu_p \\Delta p] = q[\\mu_n N_D + (\\mu_n+\\mu_p)\\Delta n]$. We require the resistivity to be halved, meaning the conductivity is doubled: $\\sigma_{\\text{mod}} = 2\\sigma_0$.\n    $$ q[\\mu_n N_D + (\\mu_n+\\mu_p)\\Delta n] = 2(q \\mu_n N_D) \\implies (\\mu_n+\\mu_p)\\Delta n = \\mu_n N_D \\implies \\Delta n = \\frac{\\mu_n N_D}{\\mu_n + \\mu_p} $$\n    The formula is correct.\n-   **Calculation**: We compute the required $\\Delta n$:\n    $$ \\Delta n = \\frac{(900 \\ \\mathrm{cm^2/(V \\cdot s)}) \\times (5 \\times 10^{15} \\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}})}{900 \\ \\mathrm{cm^2/(V \\cdot s)} + 115 \\ \\mathrm{cm^2/(V \\cdot s)}} = \\frac{4.5 \\times 10^{18}}{1015} \\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}} \\approx 4.43 \\times 10^{15} \\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}} $$\n-   **Plausibility**: This required excess carrier density, $\\Delta n \\approx 4.43 \\times 10^{15} \\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$, is slightly less than the background doping $N_D = 5 \\times 10^{15} \\ \\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$. This marks the onset of the high-injection regime. As established in the analysis of option A, a surge current of $J_{\\text{peak}} = 300 \\ \\mathrm{A/cm^2}$ will drive the JBS diode deep into high injection, producing excess carrier densities far greater than this threshold value. Therefore, the conclusion that halving the resistivity is plausible is a conservative but entirely correct statement.\n-   **Verdict**: The derivation, calculation, and physical reasoning are all sound. **Correct**.",

The channel resistance in the linear region is given by $R_{\\text{ch}} = \\frac{1}{k V_{\\text{ov}}}$, where $V_{\\text{ov}}$ is the channel overdrive voltage.\n\nGiven the steady-state channel parameter $k = 10\\ \\mathrm{S}/\\mathrm{V}$ and the steady-state overdrive $V_{\\text{ov},0} = 12\\ \\mathrm{V}$, the static channel resistance $R_{\\text{ch},0}$ is:\n$$R_{\\text{ch},0} = \\frac{1}{k V_{\\text{ov},0}} = \\frac{1}{(10\\ \\mathrm{S}/\\mathrm{V}) \\times (12\\ \\mathrm{V})} = \\frac{1}{120\\ \\mathrm{S}} = \\frac{1}{120}\\ \\Omega$$\nNumerically, this is $R_{\\text{ch},0} \\approx 8.333\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega$.\n\nThe total static on-resistance $R_{\\text{on},0}$ is then calculated by adding the given drift-region resistance $R_{\\text{drift}} = 31.7\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega$:\n$$R_{\\text{on},0} = R_{\\text{drift}} + R_{\\text{ch},0} = 31.7\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega + \\frac{1000}{120}\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega \\approx 31.7\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega + 8.333\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega \\approx 40.033\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega$$\nThe measured on-resistance at a long time $t = 5\\ \\mathrm{ms}$ is $R_{\\text{on}}(5\\ \\mathrm{ms}) = 40\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega$. The calculated value of $R_{\\text{on},0} \\approx 40.033\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega$ is in excellent agreement with this measurement. This correspondence validates the baseline model and confirms that the measurement at $t = 5\\ \\mathrm{ms}$ represents the steady-state condition. Henceforth, we use the measured value $R_{\\text{on},0} = 40\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega$ as the steady-state resistance.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Time-Dependent On-Resistance Model**\n\nThe total on-resistance at any time $t$ is the sum of the constant drift resistance and the time-dependent channel resistance:\n$$R_{\\text{on}}(t) = R_{\\text{drift}} + R_{\\text{ch}}(t)$$\nThe dynamic behavior is due to trapped electrons near the interface, which cause a transient shift in the threshold voltage, $\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}(t)$. This shift reduces the channel overdrive voltage:\n$$V_{\\text{ov}}(t) = V_{GS} - V_{\\text{th}}(t) = V_{GS} - (V_{\\text{th},0} + \\Delta V_{\\text{th}}(t)) = (V_{GS} - V_{\\text{th},0}) - \\Delta V_{\\text{th}}(t) = V_{\\text{ov},0} - \\Delta V_{\\text{th}}(t)$$\nThe time-dependent channel resistance is therefore:\n$$R_{\\text{ch}}(t) = \\frac{1}{k V_{\\text{ov}}(t)} = \\frac{1}{k (V_{\\text{ov},0} - \\Delta V_{\\text{th}}(t))}$$\nTo simplify this expression, we factor out the steady-state term $k V_{\\text{ov},0}$:\n$$R_{\\text{ch}}(t) = \\frac{1}{k V_{\\text{ov},0} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}(t)}{V_{\\text{ov},0}}\\right)} = R_{\\text{ch},0} \\left(1 - \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}(t)}{V_{\\text{ov},0}}\\right)^{-1}$$\nThe problem asks for an expression to leading order in the small quantity $x = \\Delta V_{\\text{th}}(t)/V_{\\text{ov},0}$. Using the Taylor series expansion $(1-x)^{-1} \\approx 1 + x$ for $|x| \\ll 1$, we get:\n$$R_{\\text{ch}}(t) \\approx R_{\\text{ch},0} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}(t)}{V_{\\text{ov},0}}\\right)$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the total on-resistance:\n$$R_{\\text{on}}(t) = R_{\\text{drift}} + R_{\\text{ch}}(t) \\approx R_{\\text{drift}} + R_{\\text{ch},0} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}(t)}{V_{\\text{ov},0}}\\right)$$\n$$R_{\\text{on}}(t) \\approx (R_{\\text{drift}} + R_{\\text{ch},0}) + R_{\\text{ch},0} \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}(t)}{V_{\\text{ov},0}}$$\nRecognizing that $R_{\\text{on},0} = R_{\\text{drift}} + R_{\\text{ch},0}$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$R_{\\text{on}}(t) \\approx R_{\\text{on},0} + R_{\\text{ch},0} \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}(t)}{V_{\\text{ov},0}}$$\nThe detrapping of charge follows first-order kinetics, $dN_{it}/dt = - N_{it}/\\tau$, which has the solution $N_{it}(t) = N_{it}(0) \\exp(-t/\\tau)$. Since the threshold voltage shift is proportional to the trapped charge density, $\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}(t) = \\gamma N_{it}(t)$, it also follows an exponential decay:\n$$\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}(t) = \\Delta V_{\\text{th}}(0) \\exp(-t/\\tau)$$\nwhere $\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}(0)$ is the initial threshold voltage shift at $t=0^{+}$. Substituting this into the $R_{\\text{on}}(t)$ expression, we obtain the final analytical model:\n$$R_{\\text{on}}(t) \\approx R_{\\text{on},0} + \\left( R_{\\text{ch},0} \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}(0)}{V_{\\text{ov},0}} \\right) \\exp(-t/\\tau)$$\nThis equation can be written as $R_{\\text{on}}(t) = R_{\\text{on},0} + \\Delta R_{\\text{on}}(0) \\exp(-t/\\tau)$, where $\\Delta R_{\\text{on}}(0) = R_{\\text{on}}(0) - R_{\\text{on},0}$ is the initial excess on-resistance. This implies that the excess resistance $\\Delta R_{\\text{on}}(t) = R_{\\text{on}}(t) - R_{\\text{on},0}$ decays exponentially with time constant $\\tau$.\n\n**3. Calculation of the Time Constant $\\tau$**\n\nWe use the measured data to determine $\\tau$. The excess resistance is $\\Delta R_{\\text{on}}(t) = R_{\\text{on}}(t) - R_{\\text{on},0}$.\nUsing $R_{\\text{on},0} = 40\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega$:\n- At $t_1 = 0.5\\ \\mu\\mathrm{s}$, $R_{\\text{on}}(t_1) = 60\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega$. The excess resistance is $\\Delta R_{\\text{on}}(t_1) = 60\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega - 40\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega = 20\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega$.\n- At $t_2 = 5\\ \\mu\\mathrm{s}$, $R_{\\text{on}}(t_2) = 48\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega$. The excess resistance is $\\Delta R_{\\text{on}}(t_2) = 48\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega - 40\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega = 8\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega$.\n\nWe have the following system of equations from the model $\\Delta R_{\\text{on}}(t) = \\Delta R_{\\text{on}}(0) \\exp(-t/\\tau)$, where $t$ is in microseconds ($\\mu\\mathrm{s}$):\n$$20\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega = \\Delta R_{\\text{on}}(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0.5}{\\tau}\\right)$$\n$$8\\ \\mathrm{m}\\Omega = \\Delta R_{\\text{on}}(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{5}{\\tau}\\right)$$\nTo solve for $\\tau$, we divide the first equation by the second:\n$$\\frac{20}{8} = \\frac{\\Delta R_{\\text{on}}(0) \\exp(-0.5/\\tau)}{\\Delta R_{\\text{on}}(0) \\exp(-5/\\tau)}$$\n$$2.5 = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0.5}{\\tau} - \\left(-\\frac{5}{\\tau}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$2.5 = \\exp\\left(\\frac{4.5}{\\tau}\\right)$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln(2.5) = \\frac{4.5}{\\tau}$$\nSolving for $\\tau$:\n$$\\tau = \\frac{4.5}{\\ln(2.5)}$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$\\tau \\approx \\frac{4.5}{0.91629} \\approx 4.91114\\ \\mu\\mathrm{s}$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures as required, we get:\n$$\\tau \\approx 4.91\\ \\mu\\mathrm{s}$$\nThe time constant is expressed in microseconds. The final numerical answer is $4.91$.",
