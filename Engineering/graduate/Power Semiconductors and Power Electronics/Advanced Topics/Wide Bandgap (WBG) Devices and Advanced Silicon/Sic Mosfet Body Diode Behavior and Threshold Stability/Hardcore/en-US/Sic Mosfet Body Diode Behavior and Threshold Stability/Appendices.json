The information provided is self-contained and sufficient for a unique solution. The presence of the commutating current slew rate, while not used in the final calculation, provides context for the measurement conditions and does not contradict the provided current model.\n\nThe problem asks for the computation of two quantities related to the reverse recovery of a SiC MOSFET's body diode: the total reverse recovery charge, $Q_{rr}$, and the peak reverse current, $I_{\\text{peak}}$. The reverse current, $i_{R}(t)$, for time $t \\ge 0$ is given by the function:\n$$\ni_{R}(t) = I_{0}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)\n$$\nThe parameters for this model are provided as $I_{0} = 22.5\\ \\text{A}$ and $\\tau = 60\\ \\text{ns}$.
