            "problem": "A lateral Aluminum Gallium Nitride/Gallium Nitride High Electron Mobility Transistor (AlGaN/GaN HEMT) with a gate-connected field plate is operated in the high-voltage off-state.

The source, gate, and field plate are at $0$ V, and the drain is biased at a positive voltage $V_{DS}$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for an analysis of the electric field distribution in the gate-drain access region of an AlGaN/GaN HEMT under specific simplifying assumptions, and to identify the location of the maximum lateral electric field and the region most susceptible to charge trapping.\n\nThe problem statement is first validated for scientific soundness, consistency, and completeness.\nGivens:\nDevice: Lateral AlGaN/GaN HEMT with a gate-connected field plate.\nGeometry: Gate-to-drain spacing $L_{GD} = 15~\\mu\\text{m}$; field plate length $L_{FP} = 9~\\mu\\text{m}$; SiN passivation thickness $t_{p} = 120~\\text{nm}$; SiN relative permittivity $\\varepsilon_{r} = 7.5$.\nBias Conditions: Source, gate, and field plate potential is $0~\\text{V}$; drain potential is $V_{DS} = 450~\\text{V}$.\nPhysical Model:\n1.

The field plate holds the surface potential at the gate potential ($0~\\text{V}$) for $0 \\leq x \\leq L_{FP}$, where $x=0$ is the gate edge.\n3.  The lateral potential drop from $x=L_{FP}$ to $x=L_{GD}$ is approximately linear.\n\nValidation Verdict: The problem is valid. It describes a standard power semiconductor device structure and employs a set of common, simplifying approximations used in first-order device analysis. The parameters are physically realistic, and the problem is well-posed and self-contained, allowing for a unique solution within the provided modeling framework.\n\nWe establish a coordinate system where the $x$-axis lies along the semiconductor surface, with the gate electrode edge at $x=0$. The drain contact begins at $x=L_{GD}$.\n\nPart 1: Lateral Electric Field $E_x(x)$ and its Maximum\n\nThe problem specifies a simplified model for the surface potential, $\\phi_s(x)$.\n- For the region under the field plate, $0 \\leq x \\leq L_{FP}$, the surface potential is held at the gate potential: $\\phi_s(x) = 0~\\text{V}$.\n- For the uncovered access region, $L_{FP} < x < L_{GD}$, the potential drop is linear. The potential must rise from $\\phi_s(L_{FP}) = 0~\\text{V}$ to the drain potential $\\phi_s(L_{GD}) = V_{DS}$.\n\nA linear potential variation between two points is described by a straight line. The potential $\\phi_s(x)$ in the uncovered region is thus:\n$$ \\phi_s(x) = \\phi_s(L_{FP}) + \\frac{\\phi_s(L_{GD}) - \\phi_s(L_{FP})}{L_{GD} - L_{FP}} (x - L_{FP}) $$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$ \\phi_s(x) = 0 + \\frac{V_{DS} - 0}{L_{GD} - L_{FP}} (x - L_{FP}) = \\frac{V_{DS}(x - L_{FP})}{L_{GD} - L_{FP}} \\quad \\text{for} \\quad L_{FP} \\leq x \\leq L_{GD} $$\nThe lateral electric field at the surface, $E_{x,s}(x)$, is the negative gradient of this potential:\n$$ E_{x,s}(x) = - \\frac{d\\phi_s(x)}{dx} $$\nIn the region under the field plate ($0 < x < L_{FP}$), since $\\phi_s(x) = 0$, the lateral field is $E_{x,s}(x) = 0$.\nIn the uncovered region ($L_{FP} < x < L_{GD}$), the lateral field is:\n$$ E_{x,s}(x) = - \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{V_{DS}(x - L_{FP})}{L_{GD} - L_{FP}} \\right) = - \\frac{V_{DS}}{L_{GD} - L_{FP}} $$\nThe magnitude of the lateral electric field in this region is constant:\n$$ |E_{x,s}(x)| = \\frac{V_{DS}}{L_{GD} - L_{FP}} $$\nThis simplified model yields a piecewise constant lateral field: zero under the field plate and a large, constant value in the uncovered region. The question asks for the maximum lateral field, $E_{\\max}$, and its coordinate, $x_{\\max}$.\nWithin this model, the maximum field magnitude is $E_{\\max} = \\frac{V_{DS}}{L_{GD} - L_{FP}}$. In any real physical system, the field cannot change discontinuously. The abrupt jump from $E_x=0$ to $E_x = -V_{DS}/(L_{GD} - L_{FP})$ at $x=L_{FP}$ is an artifact of the \"broken-line\" potential model. In reality, this discontinuity is smoothed into a sharp peak centered at the edge of the field plate. Therefore, the coordinate of the maximum field is taken to be the location of this feature:\n$$ x_{\\max} = L_{FP} $$\nNow, we calculate the numerical value of $E_{\\max}$:\n$$ E_{\\max} = \\frac{V_{DS}}{L_{GD} - L_{FP}} = \\frac{450~\\text{V}}{15~\\mu\\text{m} - 9~\\mu\\text{m}} = \\frac{450~\\text{V}}{6~\\mu\\text{m}} = \\frac{450~\\text{V}}{6 \\times 10^{-6}~\\text{m}} = 7.5 \\times 10^{7}~\\frac{\\text{V}}{\\text{m}} $$\nTo convert this to $\\text{MV}/\\text{cm}$:\n$$ E_{\\max} = (7.5 \\times 10^{7}~\\text{V/m}) \\times \\left(\\frac{1~\\text{MV}}{10^6~\\text{V}}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{10^{-2}~\\text{m}}{1~\\text{cm}}\\right) = 0.75~\\frac{\\text{MV}}{\\text{cm}} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, $E_{\\max} = 0.750~\\text{MV/cm}$.\nThe coordinate is $x_{\\max} = L_{FP} = 9~\\mu\\text{m}$. Rounding to three significant figures, $x_{\\max} = 9.00~\\mu\\text{m}$.\n\nPart 2: Location of Maximum Trap Filling\n\nThe problem states that trap capture scales with the magnitude of the normal electric displacement, $|\\mathbf{D}_{n}|$, at the dielectric/semiconductor interface ($y=0$). The normal direction is the $y$-direction, so we are seeking the location of maximum $|D_y(x, y=0)|$. Since $\\mathbf{D} = \\varepsilon \\mathbf{E}$, this is equivalent to finding the location of maximum normal electric field magnitude, $|E_y(x, y=0)|$.\n\nThe electrostatics in the passivation layer are governed by Laplace's equation, $\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0$, which in two dimensions is $\\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial y^2} = 0$. This implies $\\frac{\\partial E_x}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial E_y}{\\partial y} = 0$.\nOur simplified model for the surface potential $\\phi_s(x)$ leads to a lateral field $E_{x,s}(x)$ that is discontinuous at $x=L_{FP}$. The derivative $\\frac{\\partial E_{x,s}}{\\partial x}$ is mathematically a Dirac delta function at $x=L_{FP}$. For the relation $\\frac{\\partial E_y}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{\\partial E_x}{\\partial x}$ to hold, $\\frac{\\partial E_y}{\\partial y}$ must also be singular at $x=L_{FP}$. This implies that the normal field $E_y$ itself must exhibit a peak or a sharp feature at this location.\nIn physical terms, the abrupt termination of the field plate's influence at $x=L_{FP}$ causes field lines to crowd at this edge, resulting in a strong peak in the electric field, which has both lateral and normal components. The location where the boundary condition on the surface potential gradient changes discontinuously is precisely where the normal component of the electric field will be strongest.\n\nTherefore, the location where trap filling is most likely to be maximum is at the drain-side edge of the field plate: $x=L_{FP}$.\n\nThe final numerical answer required is the pair $(E_{\\max}, x_{\\max})$.\n$E_{\\max} \\approx 0.750~\\text{MV/cm}$\n$x_{\\max} \\approx 9.00~\\mu\\text{m}$",

            "solution": "The problem is subjected to validation and is found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and self-contained. The provided physical model and parameters are consistent with the established principles of semiconductor device physics for Gallium Nitride (GaN) transistors. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a multi-step analysis: first, deriving the analytical expression for the channel resistance; second, solving the differential equations for trap occupancy dynamics to find its value at the measurement time; and third, combining these results to compute the total dynamic on-resistance.\n\n**Step 1: Derivation of the Channel Resistance Expression**\n\nThe on-state conduction in the channel is governed by the drift of electrons in the Two-Dimensional Electron Gas (2DEG). The total current, $I$, flowing through the channel of width $W$ is related to the sheet current density, $J_s$, by $I = J_s W$. The sheet current density is the product of the total mobile sheet charge density and the electron drift velocity, $v_d$: $J_s = (q n_{2D}^{\\mathrm{eff}}) v_d$. The drift velocity is related to the electric field, $E$, through the electron mobility, $\\mu$, by $v_d = \\mu E$.\n\nCombining these, the current is $I = q n_{2D}^{\\mathrm{eff}}(t) \\mu E W$.\nFor a small drain bias, the electric field can be considered uniform along the channel of length $L$, so $E = V_{ch} / L$, where $V_{ch}$ is the voltage drop across the channel.\nSubstituting for $E$, we get:\n$$\nI = q n_{2D}^{\\mathrm{eff}}(t) \\mu \\left(\\frac{V_{ch}}{L}\\right) W\n$$\nThe channel resistance, $R_{ch}(t)$, is defined as the ratio of the channel voltage to the current, $R_{ch}(t) = V_{ch} / I$. Rearranging the expression for the current, we find the expression for the time-dependent channel resistance:\n$$\nR_{ch}(t) = \\frac{V_{ch}}{I} = \\frac{L}{W q \\mu n_{2D}^{\\mathrm{eff}}(t)}\n$$\nThe effective sheet carrier density is given by $n_{2D}^{\\mathrm{eff}}(t) = n_{2D,0} - \\gamma x(t)$, where $x(t)$ is the time-dependent areal density of occupied traps.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of Trap Occupancy Dynamics**\n\nWe must solve for the occupied trap density, $x(t)$, through two distinct phases: the on-state stress phase and the subsequent off-state recovery phase.\n\n**Phase I: On-state ($0 \\leq t \\leq t_{\\mathrm{on}}$)**\nThe dynamics of the occupied trap density, $x(t)$, are described by the first-order linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\lambda_{c,\\mathrm{on}}(N_t - x(t)) - \\lambda_{e,\\mathrm{on}}x(t)\n$$\nThis can be rearranged into standard form:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} + (\\lambda_{c,\\mathrm{on}} + \\lambda_{e,\\mathrm{on}})x(t) = \\lambda_{c,\\mathrm{on}}N_t\n$$\nThe general solution to this equation is the sum of the steady-state solution and a transient component. The steady-state trap occupancy, $x_{\\mathrm{ss,on}}$, is found by setting $\\frac{dx}{dt} = 0$:\n$$\nx_{\\mathrm{ss,on}} = \\frac{\\lambda_{c,\\mathrm{on}}N_t}{\\lambda_{c,\\mathrm{on}} + \\lambda_{e,\\mathrm{on}}}\n$$\nThe solution is of the form $x(t) = x_{\\mathrm{ss,on}} + C \\exp(-(\\lambda_{c,\\mathrm{on}} + \\lambda_{e,\\mathrm{on}})t)$. Using the initial condition $x(0) = 0$, we find the integration constant $C = -x_{\\mathrm{ss,on}}$.\nThus, for the duration of the on-state, the trap occupancy is:\n$$\nx(t) = x_{\\mathrm{ss,on}}\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-(\\lambda_{c,\\mathrm{on}} + \\lambda_{e,\\mathrm{on}})t\\right)\\right)\n$$\nAt the end of the on-state period, $t = t_{\\mathrm{on}}$, the trap density is:\n$$\nx(t_{\\mathrm{on}}) = \\frac{\\lambda_{c,\\mathrm{on}}N_t}{\\lambda_{c,\\mathrm{on}} + \\lambda_{e,\\mathrm{on}}}\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-(\\lambda_{c,\\mathrm{on}} + \\lambda_{e,\\mathrm{on}})t_{\\mathrm{on}}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\n**Phase II: Off-state ($t > t_{\\mathrm{on}}$)**\nStarting from $t = t_{\\mathrm{on}}$, the device is in the off-state. The dynamics are governed by:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = -\\lambda_{e,\\mathrm{off}}x(t)\n$$\nThis is a simple exponential decay equation. The solution for $t > t_{\\mathrm{on}}$ is:\n$$\nx(t) = x(t_{\\mathrm{on}}) \\exp\\left(-\\lambda_{e,\\mathrm{off}}(t - t_{\\mathrm{on}})\\right)\n$$\nwhere $x(t_{\\mathrm{on}})$ is the final value from Phase I, serving as the initial condition for Phase II.\n\n**Step 3: Calculation of Trap Occupancy at Measurement Time, $x(t_m)$**\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values.\nThe on-state rate constants are $\\lambda_{c,\\mathrm{on}} = 4.0 \\times 10^{3} \\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ and $\\lambda_{e,\\mathrm{on}} = 8.0 \\times 10^{1} \\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$. The total trap density is $N_t = 3.0 \\times 10^{16} \\ \\mathrm{m^{-2}}$.\nThe steady-state on-state trap occupancy is:\n$$\nx_{\\mathrm{ss,on}} = \\frac{(4.0 \\times 10^{3} \\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}})(3.0 \\times 10^{16} \\ \\mathrm{m^{-2}})}{(4.0 \\times 10^{3} \\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}) + (8.0 \\times 10^{1} \\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}})} = \\frac{1.2 \\times 10^{20}}{4080} \\ \\mathrm{m^{-2}} \\approx 2.94118 \\times 10^{16} \\ \\mathrm{m^{-2}}\n$$\nThe on-state stress duration is $t_{\\mathrm{on}} = 1.2 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{s}$. The exponent argument is:\n$$\n(\\lambda_{c,\\mathrm{on}} + \\lambda_{e,\\mathrm{on}})t_{\\mathrm{on}} = (4080 \\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}})(1.2 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{s}) = 4.896\n$$\nThe trap occupancy at the end of the stress is:\n$$\nx(t_{\\mathrm{on}}) = (2.94118 \\times 10^{16} \\ \\mathrm{m^{-2}}) \\times (1 - \\exp(-4.896)) \\approx (2.94118 \\times 10^{16}) \\times (1 - 0.007476) \\approx 2.91924 \\times 10^{16} \\ \\mathrm{m^{-2}}\n$$\nNow we evaluate the trap density at the measurement time $t_m = t_{\\mathrm{on}} + 2.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{s}$. The recovery time is $t_m - t_{\\mathrm{on}} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{s}$, and the off-state emission rate constant is $\\lambda_{e,\\mathrm{off}} = 6.0 \\times 10^{1} \\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\nThe exponent for the off-state decay is:\n$$\n\\lambda_{e,\\mathrm{off}}(t_m - t_{\\mathrm{on}}) = (60 \\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}})(2.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{s}) = 0.15\n$$\nThe trap occupancy at the measurement time is:\n$$\nx(t_m) = x(t_{\\mathrm{on}}) \\exp(-0.15) \\approx (2.91924 \\times 10^{16} \\ \\mathrm{m^{-2}}) \\times \\exp(-0.15) \\approx (2.91924 \\times 10^{16}) \\times 0.860708 \\approx 2.51263 \\times 10^{16} \\ \\mathrm{m^{-2}}\n$$\n\n**Step 4: Calculation of Total Dynamic On-Resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{on}}(t_m)$**\n\nFirst, we calculate the effective sheet carrier density $n_{2D}^{\\mathrm{eff}}(t_m)$ using the nominal density $n_{2D,0} = 9.0 \\times 10^{16} \\ \\mathrm{m^{-2}}$ and coupling factor $\\gamma = 0.60$:\n$$\nn_{2D}^{\\mathrm{eff}}(t_m) = n_{2D,0} - \\gamma x(t_m) = 9.0 \\times 10^{16} \\ \\mathrm{m^{-2}} - (0.60) \\times (2.51263 \\times 10^{16} \\ \\mathrm{m^{-2}})\n$$\n$$\nn_{2D}^{\\mathrm{eff}}(t_m) = (9.0 - 1.50758) \\times 10^{16} \\ \\mathrm{m^{-2}} = 7.49242 \\times 10^{16} \\ \\mathrm{m^{-2}}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the channel resistance $R_{ch}(t_m)$ using the derived formula with the given parameters: $L = 1.5 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $W = 5.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $\\mu = 0.18 \\ \\mathrm{m^2 \\ V^{-1} \\ s^{-1}}$, and $q = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\ \\mathrm{C}$.\n$$\nR_{ch}(t_m) = \\frac{L}{W q \\mu n_{2D}^{\\mathrm{eff}}(t_m)} = \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m}}{(5.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{m})(1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\ \\mathrm{C})(0.18 \\ \\mathrm{m^2 \\ V^{-1} \\ s^{-1}})(7.49242 \\times 10^{16} \\ \\mathrm{m^{-2}})}\n$$\nThe denominator evaluates to:\n$$\n(5.0 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times (1.602 \\times 10^{-19}) \\times (0.18) \\times (7.49242 \\times 10^{16}) \\approx 1.0803 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{A \\ V^{-1}}\n$$\nSo, the channel resistance is:\n$$\nR_{ch}(t_m) = \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{-6}}{1.0803 \\times 10^{-6}} \\ \\Omega \\approx 1.3885 \\ \\Omega\n$$\nThe total dynamic on-resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{on}}(t_m)$, is the sum of the channel resistance and the constant parasitic resistances, $R_{\\mathrm{access}} = 0.18 \\ \\Omega$ and $R_c = 0.12 \\ \\Omega$.\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{on}}(t_m) = R_{ch}(t_m) + R_{\\mathrm{access}} + R_c = 1.3885 \\ \\Omega + 0.18 \\ \\Omega + 0.12 \\ \\Omega = 1.6885 \\ \\Omega\n$$\nRounding the final answer to four significant figures gives $1.689 \\ \\Omega$.",
