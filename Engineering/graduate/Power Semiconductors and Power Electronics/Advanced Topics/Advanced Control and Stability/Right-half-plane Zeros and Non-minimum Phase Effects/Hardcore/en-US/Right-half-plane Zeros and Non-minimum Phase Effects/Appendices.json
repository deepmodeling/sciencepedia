            "problem": "A continuous conduction mode (CCM) buck converter supplies a resistive load using a switching network driven by duty ratio control. The inductor of value $L$ connects the input source voltage $V_{g}$ to the output node during the switch “on” interval, and the diode connects the inductor to ground during the “off” interval. The output network comprises a capacitor of value $C$ with a nonzero Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR) $r_{c}$, placed in series with the capacitor between the output node and ground, and a load resistance $R$ tied from the output node to ground. The Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) process operates at switching period $T_{s}$ and is configured so that the inductor current remains continuous for the operating point under consideration. Assume ideal switch and diode, and neglect parasitic resistances other than the capacitor ESR $r_{c}$.\n\nStarting from first principles for lumped elements and circuit laws, namely Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL), Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL), the inductor law $v_{L} = L\\, di_{L}/dt$, and the capacitor law $i_{C} = C\\, dv_{C}/dt$, derive the small-signal, duty-to-output transfer function $G_{vd}(s) = \\hat{v}_{o}(s)/\\hat{d}(s)$ about a nonzero steady-state duty ratio, where $\\hat{v}_{o}(s)$ and $\\hat{d}(s)$ denote the Laplace transforms of small-signal perturbations in output voltage and duty ratio, respectively.\n\nYour derivation must:\n- Use averaged switch modeling to obtain the continuous-time small-signal relations in CCM.\n- Include the effect of the capacitor’s ESR $r_{c}$ in the modeling.\n- Treat the PWM process as a static gain for low-frequency averaged dynamics, but also state, based on an explicit sampling model such as a zero-order hold $H(s) = \\left(1 - \\exp(-s T_{s})\\right)/(s T_{s})$, where any sampling-induced zeros lie in the complex plane without incorporating $H(s)$ into the low-frequency $G_{vd}(s)$.\n\nConclude by identifying the location of the zeros of $G_{vd}(s)$ and whether any right-half-plane (RHP) zero exists in CCM for the buck converter. Express the final answer as a single closed-form analytic expression for $G_{vd}(s)$ in terms of $V_{g}$, $L$, $C$, $r_{c}$, $R$, and $s$. No numerical approximation is required for the final expression, and no physical units need be included in the final answer.",

The inclusion of ESR enhances its physical relevance.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Transfer Function**\n\nWe will employ the state-space averaging method. The state variables are chosen as the inductor current, $i_L(t)$, and the voltage across the capacitor proper, $v_C(t)$. The state vector is $x(t) = \\begin{pmatrix} i_L(t) & v_C(t) \\end{pmatrix}^T$. The output of interest is the load voltage, $v_o(t)$.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the output voltage $v_o$ and the state variables. The output network consists of the capacitor $C$ in series with its ESR $r_c$, and this branch is in parallel with the load resistor $R$. The inductor current $i_L$ feeds into this parallel combination.\n\nBy Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at the output node:\n$$i_L(t) = i_C(t) + i_R(t)$$\nThe load current is $i_R(t) = v_o(t)/R$. The output voltage is the sum of the capacitor voltage and the voltage across the ESR:\n$$v_o(t) = v_C(t) + i_C(t) r_c$$\nFrom this, we can express the capacitor current as $i_C(t) = \\frac{v_o(t) - v_C(t)}{r_c}$.\nSubstituting these into the KCL equation:\n$$i_L(t) = \\frac{v_o(t) - v_C(t)}{r_c} + \\frac{v_o(t)}{R} = v_o(t) \\left(\\frac{1}{r_c} + \\frac{1}{R}\\right) - \\frac{v_C(t)}{r_c}$$\nSolving for the output voltage $v_o(t)$ in terms of the state variables gives the output equation:\n$$v_o(t) \\left(\\frac{R+r_c}{R r_c}\\right) = i_L(t) + \\frac{v_C(t)}{r_c}$$\n$$v_o(t) = \\frac{R r_c}{R+r_c} i_L(t) + \\frac{R}{R+r_c} v_C(t)$$\nThis can be written as $y(t) = C_{out} x(t)$ with the output matrix $C_{out} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{R r_c}{R+r_c} & \\frac{R}{R+r_c} \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nNext, we derive the state equations for the two switching intervals.\n\n**Interval 1: Switch ON (duration $d T_s$)**\nThe switch is closed, connecting the input voltage $V_g$ to the inductor. The voltage across the inductor is given by KVL:\n$$v_L(t) = V_g - v_o(t)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $v_o(t)$:\n$$L \\frac{di_L}{dt} = V_g - \\left( \\frac{R r_c}{R+r_c} i_L(t) + \\frac{R}{R+r_c} v_C(t) \\right)$$\n$$\\frac{di_L}{dt} = -\\frac{R r_c}{L(R+r_c)} i_L(t) - \\frac{R}{L(R+r_c)} v_C(t) + \\frac{1}{L} V_g$$\nThe capacitor dynamics are governed by $i_C(t) = C \\frac{dv_C}{dt}$. From KCL, $i_C(t) = i_L(t) - i_R(t) = i_L(t) - v_o(t)/R$.\n$$C \\frac{dv_C}{dt} = i_L(t) - \\frac{1}{R} \\left( \\frac{R r_c}{R+r_c} i_L(t) + \\frac{R}{R+r_c} v_C(t) \\right)$$\n$$C \\frac{dv_C}{dt} = \\left(1 - \\frac{r_c}{R+r_c}\\right) i_L(t) - \\frac{1}{R+r_c} v_C(t) = \\frac{R}{R+r_c} i_L(t) - \\frac{1}{R+r_c} v_C(t)$$\n$$\\frac{dv_C}{dt} = \\frac{R}{C(R+r_c)} i_L(t) - \\frac{1}{C(R+r_c)} v_C(t)$$\n\n**Interval 2: Switch OFF (duration $(1-d) T_s$)**\nThe switch is open, and the diode conducts, connecting the inductor input to ground (assuming an ideal diode with zero forward drop). The voltage across the inductor is:\n$$v_L(t) = 0 - v_o(t) = -v_o(t)$$\n$$L \\frac{di_L}{dt} = -\\left( \\frac{R r_c}{R+r_c} i_L(t) + \\frac{R}{R+r_c} v_C(t) \\right)$$\n$$\\frac{di_L}{dt} = -\\frac{R r_c}{L(R+r_c)} i_L(t) - \\frac{R}{L(R+r_c)} v_C(t)$$\nThe output network topology is unchanged, so the equation for $\\frac{dv_C}{dt}$ remains the same as in Interval 1.\n\n**Averaged Model and Linearization**\nThe state equations can be written as $\\dot{x} = A x + B u$, where the dynamics matrix $A$ is common to both intervals, and the input vector changes.\n$$A = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{R r_c}{L(R+r_c)} & -\\frac{R}{L(R+r_c)} \\\\ \\frac{R}{C(R+r_c)} & -\\frac{1}{C(R+r_c)} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nDuring the ON interval, the input is $V_g$. The system is $\\dot{x} = A x + B_1 V_g$, where $B_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/L & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^T$.\nDuring the OFF interval, the input is $0$. The system is $\\dot{x} = A x$.\nThe averaged state equation is:\n$$\\dot{\\bar{x}} = d(A \\bar{x} + B_1 V_g) + (1-d)(A \\bar{x}) = A \\bar{x} + d B_1 V_g$$\nLet each variable be the sum of a DC steady-state value (capital letter) and a small AC perturbation (hat symbol): $\\bar{x}(t) = X + \\hat{x}(t)$, $d(t) = D + \\hat{d}(t)$, and $\\bar{v}_o(t) = V_o + \\hat{v}_o(t)$. We assume $V_g$ is a constant DC source.\n$$\\frac{d}{dt}(X+\\hat{x}) = A(X+\\hat{x}) + (D+\\hat{d})B_1 V_g$$\n$$\\dot{\\hat{x}} = AX + A\\hat{x} + D B_1 V_g + \\hat{d} B_1 V_g$$\nSeparating this into DC and AC components (and ignoring second-order small terms like $\\hat{d}\\hat{x}$):\nDC (steady-state): $0 = AX + D B_1 V_g$\nAC (small-signal): $\\dot{\\hat{x}} = A\\hat{x} + B_1 V_g \\hat{d}$\nThe AC output is $\\hat{v}_o = C_{out} \\hat{x}$.\n\n**Derivation of the Transfer Function**\nTaking the Laplace transform of the AC equations:\n$$s \\hat{x}(s) = A \\hat{x}(s) + B_1 V_g \\hat{d}(s)$$\n$$\\hat{v}_o(s) = C_{out} \\hat{x}(s)$$\nSolving for $\\hat{x}(s)$:\n$$(sI - A)\\hat{x}(s) = B_1 V_g \\hat{d}(s) \\implies \\hat{x}(s) = (sI - A)^{-1} B_1 V_g \\hat{d}(s)$$\nThe duty-to-output transfer function is $G_{vd}(s) = \\frac{\\hat{v}_o(s)}{\\hat{d}(s)} = V_g C_{out} (sI - A)^{-1} B_1$.\n\nWe need to compute $(sI - A)^{-1}$.\n$$sI - A = \\begin{pmatrix} s + \\frac{R r_c}{L(R+r_c)} & \\frac{R}{L(R+r_c)} \\\\ -\\frac{R}{C(R+r_c)} & s + \\frac{1}{C(R+r_c)} \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe determinant is:\n$$\\det(sI - A) = \\left(s + \\frac{R r_c}{L(R+r_c)}\\right)\\left(s + \\frac{1}{C(R+r_c)}\\right) + \\frac{R^2}{LC(R+r_c)^2}$$\n$$\\det(sI - A) = s^2 + s\\left(\\frac{R r_c}{L(R+r_c)} + \\frac{1}{C(R+r_c)}\\right) + \\frac{R r_c}{LC(R+r_c)^2} + \\frac{R^2}{LC(R+r_c)^2}$$\n$$\\det(sI - A) = s^2 + s\\left(\\frac{C R r_c + L}{LC(R+r_c)}\\right) + \\frac{R(r_c+R)}{LC(R+r_c)^2} = s^2 + s\\frac{L+CRr_c}{LC(R+r_c)} + \\frac{R}{LC(R+r_c)}$$\nThe transfer function expression is $G_{vd}(s) = V_g \\frac{C_{out} \\cdot \\text{adj}(sI-A) \\cdot B_1}{\\det(sI-A)}$. The numerator term is:\n$$C_{out} \\cdot \\text{adj}(sI-A) \\cdot B_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{R r_c}{R+r_c} & \\frac{R}{R+r_c} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} s + \\frac{1}{C(R+r_c)} & \\dots \\\\ \\frac{R}{C(R+r_c)} & \\dots \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{L} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nWe only need the first column of the adjoint matrix.\n$$= \\left( \\frac{R r_c}{R+r_c} \\left(s + \\frac{1}{C(R+r_c)}\\right) + \\frac{R}{R+r_c} \\frac{R}{C(R+r_c)} \\right) \\frac{1}{L}$$\n$$= \\frac{1}{L} \\frac{R}{R+r_c} \\left( r_c s + \\frac{r_c}{C(R+r_c)} + \\frac{R}{C(R+r_c)} \\right) = \\frac{1}{L} \\frac{R}{R+r_c} \\left( r_c s + \\frac{1}{C} \\right)$$\n$$= \\frac{R}{LC(R+r_c)} (1 + s C r_c)$$\nCombining with the determinant and the $V_g$ gain:\n$$G_{vd}(s) = V_g \\frac{\\frac{R}{LC(R+r_c)} (1 + s C r_c)}{s^2 + s\\frac{L+CRr_c}{LC(R+r_c)} + \\frac{R}{LC(R+r_c)}}$$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator by $LC(R+r_c)$ yields a cleaner form:\n$$G_{vd}(s) = V_g \\frac{R(1 + s C r_c)}{s^2 LC(R+r_c) + s(L+CRr_c) + R}$$\n\n**Analysis of Zeros**\nThe zeros of the transfer function $G_{vd}(s)$ are the roots of the numerator polynomial:\n$$1 + s C r_c = 0 \\implies s_z = -\\frac{1}{C r_c}$$\nSince the capacitance $C$ and the ESR $r_c$ are positive physical quantities, the zero $s_z$ is located on the negative real axis in the complex s-plane. Therefore, the buck converter in CCM does **not** have an intrinsic right-half-plane (RHP) zero in its duty-to-output transfer function. The presence of capacitor ESR introduces a finite left-half-plane zero.\n\n**Analysis of Sampling Effects**\nThe problem asks about sampling-induced zeros from a model like the zero-order hold (ZOH) $H(s) = \\left(1 - \\exp(-s T_{s})\\right)/(s T_{s})$.\nThe ZOH transfer function $H(s)$ correctly does not have any zeros itself. However, its numerator, $N(s) = 1 - \\exp(-s T_s)$, has zeros when $\\exp(-s T_s) = 1$. This occurs for $s = j k \\frac{2\\pi}{T_s} = j k \\omega_s$ for any non-zero integer $k$, where $\\omega_s$ is the switching frequency in radians/sec. These zeros lie on the imaginary axis at multiples of the switching frequency and are a known feature of sampled-data systems, leading to aliasing. They are not RHP zeros.\nIn some contexts, \"sampling-induced RHP zero\" refers to an artifact of approximating the delay inherent in sampling and computation. For example, the Padé approximation of a delay $\\exp(-sT_s) \\approx \\frac{1-sT_s/2}{1+sT_s/2}$ introduces an RHP zero at $s = 2/T_s$ for modeling purposes. This is an approximation to capture the phase lag, not an intrinsic zero of the converter itself.",

            "introduction": "Having seen that the buck converter is inherently minimum-phase, we now turn to the classic example of a non-minimum phase system: the boost converter. A critical question for any designer is whether this challenging behavior is always present. This exercise explores the connection between the converter's operating mode and the existence of the RHP zero. You will derive the boundary condition between Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM) and Discontinuous Conduction Mode (DCM) and analyze how the system's transfer function changes when crossing this boundary .

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of circuit theory and power electronics, well-posed, and uses precise, objective language. All necessary parameters for an ideal model are provided. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe solution is approached in two parts as requested by the problem: first, the derivation of the boundary condition between Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM) and Discontinuous Conduction Mode (DCM), and second, the analysis of the duty-to-output transfer function's zero in both modes.\n\n**Part 1: CCM/DCM Boundary Condition**\n\nThe boost converter operates at the boundary between CCM and DCM when the minimum value of the inductor current over a switching cycle, $I_{L,min}$, is exactly zero.\n\nIn steady-state CCM, the average voltage across the inductor over one switching period $T_s$ is zero. This leads to the ideal voltage gain relationship:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{out}} = \\dfrac{V_{\\mathrm{in}}}{1-D}$$\nwhere $V_{\\mathrm{in}}$ is the input voltage, $V_{\\mathrm{out}}$ is the output voltage, and $D$ is the duty ratio.\n\nThe average inductor current, $I_L$, for an ideal converter can be found through power balance, $P_{\\mathrm{in}} = P_{\\mathrm{out}}$.\n$$V_{\\mathrm{in}} I_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\dfrac{V_{\\mathrm{out}}^2}{R}$$\nSince the average input current $I_{\\mathrm{in}}$ is equal to the average inductor current $I_L$, we have:\n$$I_L = I_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\dfrac{V_{\\mathrm{out}}^2}{V_{\\mathrm{in}} R} = \\dfrac{1}{V_{\\mathrm{in}} R} \\left( \\dfrac{V_{\\mathrm{in}}}{1-D} \\right)^2 = \\dfrac{V_{\\mathrm{in}}}{R(1-D)^2}$$\n\nThe inductor current ripple, $\\Delta i_{L,pp}$, is the change in current during the switch-on period ($DT_s$).\n$$v_L = L \\dfrac{di_L}{dt} = V_{\\mathrm{in}} \\quad \\text{for } 0 < t \\le DT_s$$\n$$\\Delta i_{L,pp} = \\dfrac{V_{\\mathrm{in}}}{L} DT_s$$\nThe inductor current waveform is triangular, centered around the average current $I_L$.

The state vector is $x = [i_L, v_C]^T$. The averaged state equations for small-signal perturbations around a steady-state operating point $(I_L, V_C)$ are given by:\n$$\\dot{\\hat{x}} = A \\hat{x} + B_d \\hat{d}$$\nwhere the system matrix $A$ and the control input matrix $B_d$ are:\n$$A = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & -\\frac{1-D}{L} \\\\ \\frac{1-D}{C} & -\\frac{1}{RC} \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad B_d = \\begin{bmatrix} V_C/L \\\\ -I_L/C \\end{bmatrix}$$\nThe output equation is $\\hat{y} = \\hat{v}_C = C_{\\text{ss}}\\hat{x}$, with $C_{\\text{ss}} = [0, 1]$.\n\nThe transfer function from duty cycle to output voltage is $G_{vd}(s) = C_{\\text{ss}} (sI - A)^{-1} B_d$. The zeros of this transfer function are the roots of the numerator polynomial, which is given by $\\det \\begin{bmatrix} sI-A & B_d \\\\ -C_{\\text{ss}} & 0 \\end{bmatrix}$. A more direct method is to compute the numerator of $C_{\\text{ss}} \\cdot \\mathrm{adj}(sI-A) \\cdot B_d$.\n$$sI - A = \\begin{bmatrix} s & \\frac{1-D}{L} \\\\ -\\frac{1-D}{C} & s+\\frac{1}{RC} \\end{bmatrix}$$\n$$\\mathrm{adj}(sI - A) = \\begin{bmatrix} s+\\frac{1}{RC} & -\\frac{1-D}{L} \\\\ \\frac{1-D}{C} & s \\end{bmatrix}$$\nThe numerator of $G_{vd}(s)$ is proportional to:\n$N(s) = C_{\\text{ss}} \\cdot \\mathrm{adj}(sI-A) \\cdot B_d = [0, 1] \\begin{bmatrix} s+\\frac{1}{RC} & -\\frac{1-D}{L} \\\\ \\frac{1-D}{C} & s \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} V_C/L \\\\ -I_L/C \\end{bmatrix}$\n$$N(s) = \\left[\\frac{1-D}{C}, s\\right] \\begin{bmatrix} V_C/L \\\\ -I_L/C \\end{bmatrix} = \\dfrac{(1-D)V_C}{LC} - s\\dfrac{I_L}{C}$$\nThe zero $s_z$ is found by setting $N(s_z) = 0$:\n$$s_z \\dfrac{I_L}{C} = \\dfrac{(1-D)V_C}{LC} \\implies s_z = \\dfrac{(1-D)V_C}{L I_L}$$\nSubstituting the steady-state (DC) values $V_C = V_{\\mathrm{out}} = V_{\\mathrm{in}}/(1-D)$ and $I_L = V_{\\mathrm{in}}/(R(1-D)^2)$:\n$$s_z = \\dfrac{(1-D)}{L} \\dfrac{V_{\\mathrm{in}}/(1-D)}{V_{\\mathrm{in}}/(R(1-D)^2)} = \\dfrac{(1-D)}{L} \\dfrac{V_{\\mathrm{in}}}{1-D} \\dfrac{R(1-D)^2}{V_{\\mathrm{in}}} = \\dfrac{R(1-D)^2}{L}$$\nSince $R>0$, $L>0$, and $D \\in (0,1)$, the zero $s_z$ is a positive real number. This corresponds to a zero in the right-half-plane (RHP), located at an angular frequency of $\\omega_z = s_z = \\dfrac{R(1-D)^2}{L}$. The presence of this RHP zero makes the system non-minimum phase.\n\nWhen the converter crosses into DCM (for loads $R > R_{\\mathrm{crit}}$), the dynamics change fundamentally. In DCM, the inductor current is zero for a portion of the switching cycle. The inductor's energy is completely transferred to the output capacitor and load before the next cycle begins. The state of the inductor \"resets\" to zero in every cycle. This eliminates the dynamic coupling that causes the non-minimum phase behavior. An increase in the duty cycle $D$ leads to a larger packet of energy being transferred to the output in that same cycle, resulting in a monotonic increase in the output voltage. The initial voltage dip characteristic of the RHP zero in CCM does not occur. Therefore, in DCM, the boost converter becomes a minimum-phase system, and the RHP zero disappears under ideal assumptions.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n*   **A. $R_{\\mathrm{crit}}(D) = \\dfrac{2L}{D T_s (1-D)^2}$; in CCM the duty-to-output transfer has a RHP zero at $\\omega_z = \\dfrac{R(1-D)^2}{L}$; in DCM this zero disappears and the converter becomes minimum phase under ideal assumptions.**\n    -   The formula for $R_{\\mathrm{crit}}(D)$ is correct as derived.\n    -   The location of the RHP zero in CCM is correct as derived.\n    -   The statement that the zero disappears in DCM, making the system minimum phase, is also correct.\n    -   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B. $R_{\\mathrm{crit}}(D) = \\dfrac{L}{T_s(1-D)}$; in CCM the duty-to-output transfer has a left-half-plane zero at $\\omega_z = \\dfrac{L}{R(1-D)^2}$; crossing to DCM flips the zero to the right half-plane.**\n    -   The formula for $R_{\\mathrm{crit}}(D)$ is incorrect.\n    -   The zero in a boost converter in CCM is in the RHP, not the LHP. The formula provided for $\\omega_z$ is also incorrect (it is inverted and missing a factor of $R^2$).\n    -   Crossing to DCM removes the RHP zero; it does not introduce one or flip one from the LHP to the RHP.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. $R_{\\mathrm{crit}}(D) = \\dfrac{2L}{T_s}$ (independent of $D$); in CCM the duty-to-output zero is at $\\omega_z = \\dfrac{1}{RL}$ (independent of $D$); crossing into DCM does not affect zero location.**\n    -   $R_{\\mathrm{crit}}(D)$ is strongly dependent on $D$, so this formula is incorrect.\n    -   The zero location $\\omega_z$ is dependent on $D$, so this formula is incorrect.\n    -   Crossing into DCM fundamentally changes the system dynamics and removes the RHP zero, so the claim that the location is unaffected is incorrect.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D. For a buck converter, $R_{\\mathrm{crit}}(D) = \\dfrac{2L}{(1-D)T_s}$; crossing into DCM introduces a RHP zero that is absent in CCM.**\n    -   This option addresses a buck converter, not the boost converter specified in the problem statement. Therefore, it does not answer the question.\n    -   Furthermore, the claims made about the buck converter are only partially correct. The formula for $R_{\\mathrm{crit}}(D)$ is correct for a buck converter. However, a buck converter is minimum-phase in both CCM and DCM; it does not gain a RHP zero when crossing into DCM.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**",

            "introduction": "When a boost converter operates in CCM, the presence of an RHP zero is an unavoidable reality that must be addressed in the control design. The primary consequence of an RHP zero is the introduction of phase lag, which directly reduces the system's phase margin and can lead to instability. This hands-on problem  translates theory into practice by tasking you with designing a phase-lead compensator to counteract this effect. You will quantify the phase margin lost due to the RHP zero and then determine the parameters of a compensator to restore system stability, developing a core skill for controlling non-minimum phase power electronic systems.",

            "problem": "A continuous-conduction-mode boost converter exhibits a right-half-plane (RHP) zero in its duty-to-output small-signal transfer function, which induces a non-minimum phase effect. Consider a boost converter operating at steady state with output resistance $R = 20\\,\\Omega$, inductor $L = 200\\,\\mu\\mathrm{H}$, and duty ratio $D = 0.40$. The loop is designed for a gain crossover at angular frequency $\\omega_{c} = 1.2 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of power electronics and control theory, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objective in its formulation. All physical quantities and operating conditions are realistic for a boost converter application. The problem is a standard exercise in compensator design for a non-minimum phase system.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts as requested. First, we compute the phase margin lost due to the right-half-plane (RHP) zero. Second, we design the lead compensator to recover this lost phase and determine the required lead ratio, $\\alpha$.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Phase Margin Lost**\n\nThe problem provides the parameters for a boost converter operating in continuous conduction mode (CCM):\nOutput resistance, $R = 20\\,\\Omega$\nInductor, $L = 200\\,\\mu\\mathrm{H} = 200 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{H}$\nDuty ratio, $D = 0.40$\n\nThe angular frequency of the RHP zero, $\\omega_{z,\\mathrm{RHP}}$, is given by the formula:\n$$ \\omega_{z,\\mathrm{RHP}} = \\frac{R(1 - D)^{2}}{L} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\omega_{z,\\mathrm{RHP}} = \\frac{(20\\,\\Omega)(1 - 0.40)^{2}}{200 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{H}} = \\frac{20 \\cdot (0.60)^{2}}{2 \\times 10^{-4}} = \\frac{20 \\cdot 0.36}{2 \\times 10^{-4}} = \\frac{7.2}{2 \\times 10^{-4}}\\,\\mathrm{rad/s} = 3.6 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{rad/s} $$\n\nThe transfer function of this RHP zero is of the form $G_z(s) = 1 - \\frac{s}{\\omega_{z,\\mathrm{RHP}}}$. The presence of a minus sign, instead of a plus sign as in a left-half-plane (LHP) zero, is what defines it as an RHP zero.\n\nTo find the phase contribution of this zero, we evaluate its frequency response by setting $s = j\\omega$:\n$$ G_z(j\\omega) = 1 - j\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{z,\\mathrm{RHP}}} $$\nThis is a complex number with a real part of $1$ and a negative imaginary part of $-\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{z,\\mathrm{RHP}}}$. From the fundamental geometric interpretation of phase as the argument of a complex number, the phase angle $\\phi_z(\\omega)$ is the angle of the vector from the origin to the point $(1, -\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{z,\\mathrm{RHP}}})$ in the complex plane. This is given by:\n$$ \\phi_z(\\omega) = \\arg\\left(1 - j\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{z,\\mathrm{RHP}}}\\right) = -\\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\omega}{\\omega_{z,\\mathrm{RHP}}}\\right) $$\nThis negative phase contribution is a phase lag, which reduces the system's phase margin. The phase margin is measured at the gain crossover frequency, given as $\\omega_c = 1.2 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}$. The phase margin lost, $\\Delta\\phi_{\\text{lost}}$, is the magnitude of the phase lag at this frequency.\n$$ \\Delta\\phi_{\\text{lost}} = \\left| \\phi_z(\\omega_c) \\right| = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{\\omega_c}{\\omega_{z,\\mathrm{RHP}}}\\right) $$\nSubstituting the values for $\\omega_c$ and $\\omega_{z,\\mathrm{RHP}}$:\n$$ \\Delta\\phi_{\\text{lost}} = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{1.2 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}}{3.6 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{rad/s}}\\right) = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) $$\nTo express this in degrees, we perform the conversion:\n$$ \\Delta\\phi_{\\text{lost, deg}} = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\times \\frac{180^{\\circ}}{\\pi} \\approx 18.435^{\\circ} $$\n\n**Part 2: Design of the Phase-Lead Compensator**\n\nThe objective is to design a phase-lead compensator that adds a phase lead equal to the lost phase margin, $\\Delta\\phi_{\\text{lost}}$, at the crossover frequency $\\omega_c$. The required maximum phase lead, $\\phi_m$, from the compensator must therefore be:\n$$ \\phi_m = \\Delta\\phi_{\\text{lost}} = \\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) $$\nThe problem specifies that the compensator's maximum phase lead should be centered at $\\omega_c$, meaning the compensator's center frequency $\\omega_m$ is equal to $\\omega_c$.\n\nThe transfer function of the lead compensator is given as $C(s) = K \\frac{1 + sT}{1 + sT/\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha > 1$.\nThe phase contribution of this compensator is $\\phi_{\\text{comp}}(\\omega) = \\arctan(\\omega T) - \\arctan(\\omega T/\\alpha)$. This function has a maximum value, $\\phi_m$, which is related to the parameter $\\alpha$ by the standard formula:\n$$ \\sin(\\phi_m) = \\frac{\\alpha - 1}{\\alpha + 1} $$\nWe can algebraically solve for $\\alpha$:\n$$ \\sin(\\phi_m) (\\alpha + 1) = \\alpha - 1 $$\n$$ \\sin(\\phi_m)\\alpha + \\sin(\\phi_m) = \\alpha - 1 $$\n$$ 1 + \\sin(\\phi_m) = \\alpha(1 - \\sin(\\phi_m)) $$\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{1 + \\sin(\\phi_m)}{1 - \\sin(\\phi_m)} $$\nWe need to find the value of $\\sin(\\phi_m)$ where $\\phi_m = \\arctan(1/3)$. We can use the trigonometric identity $\\sin(\\arctan(x)) = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{1+x^2}}$.\nLetting $x = 1/3$:\n$$ \\sin(\\phi_m) = \\sin\\left(\\arctan\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{1/3}{\\sqrt{1 + (1/3)^2}} = \\frac{1/3}{\\sqrt{1 + 1/9}} = \\frac{1/3}{\\sqrt{10/9}} = \\frac{1/3}{\\frac{\\sqrt{10}}{3}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}} $$\nNow, we substitute this value back into the expression for $\\alpha$:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{1 + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}}}{1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{10}}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\sqrt{10}+1}{\\sqrt{10}}}{\\frac{\\sqrt{10}-1}{\\sqrt{10}}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{10} + 1}{\\sqrt{10} - 1} $$\nTo obtain a numerical value, we can rationalize the denominator:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{\\sqrt{10} + 1}{\\sqrt{10} - 1} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{10} + 1}{\\sqrt{10} + 1} = \\frac{(\\sqrt{10} + 1)^2}{(\\sqrt{10})^2 - 1^2} = \\frac{10 + 2\\sqrt{10} + 1}{10 - 1} = \\frac{11 + 2\\sqrt{10}}{9} $$\nUsing the numerical value for $\\sqrt{10} \\approx 3.162277...$:\n$$ \\alpha \\approx \\frac{11 + 2(3.162277)}{9} = \\frac{11 + 6.324554}{9} = \\frac{17.324554}{9} \\approx 1.92495... $$\n\nFinally, we must check the constraint on the compensator's magnitude boost. The magnitude of the lead compensator at its center frequency $\\omega_m = \\omega_c$ is $|C(j\\omega_m)|/K = \\sqrt{\\alpha}$. The boost in decibels is:\n$$ \\text{Boost}_{\\text{dB}} = 20 \\log_{10}(\\sqrt{\\alpha}) = 10 \\log_{10}(\\alpha) $$\nUsing our calculated value of $\\alpha$:\n$$ \\text{Boost}_{\\text{dB}} \\approx 10 \\log_{10}(1.92495) \\approx 2.844\\,\\mathrm{dB} $$\nSince $2.844\\,\\mathrm{dB} < 3\\,\\mathrm{dB}$, the design constraint is satisfied.\n\nThe problem asks for the dimensionless lead ratio $\\alpha$ rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\alpha \\approx 1.92495... \\approx 1.925 $$",
