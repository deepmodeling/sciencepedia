            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on established principles of power electronics and provides sufficient information for a unique solution.\n\nThe solution is developed in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n### Part 1: Inductor Current Slopes\n\nThe behavior of the inductor current is governed by the fundamental inductor law, $v_{L}(t) = L \\frac{di_{L}(t)}{dt}$. The slope of the inductor current, $\\frac{di_{L}}{dt}$, is therefore $\\frac{v_{L}}{L}$.\n\nFor an ideal synchronous buck converter operating in Continuous Conduction Mode (CCM), the inductor voltage $v_{L}$ takes on two values during a switching period $T_{s}$.\n1.  During the on-time, $t \\in [0, DT_{s}]$, the main switch is on and the inductor is connected between the input and output. The voltage across the inductor is $v_{L} = V_{in} - V_{o}$.\n2.  During the off-time, $t \\in (DT_{s}, T_{s}]$, the main switch is off and the synchronous rectifier is on, connecting the inductor across the output. The voltage across the inductor is $v_{L} = -V_{o}$.\n\nThe inductor current rising slope, $m_{1}$, occurs during the on-time:\n$$m_{1} = \\frac{V_{in} - V_{o}}{L}$$\nThe inductor current falling slope occurs during the off-time. The magnitude of this slope, $m_{2}$, is:\n$$m_{2} = \\left| \\frac{-V_{o}}{L} \\right| = \\frac{V_{o}}{L}$$\n\nThe problem asks to compute these slopes for the specific operating point given by $V_{in}=12\\,\\text{V}$ and $V_{o}=1.2\\,\\text{V}$. The duty ratio $D$ at this point is $D = \\frac{V_{o}}{V_{in}} = \\frac{1.2\\,\\text{V}}{12\\,\\text{V}} = 0.1$.

To analyze it, we consider a small perturbation $\\hat{i}(n)$ in the inductor current valley at the beginning of the $n$-th switching cycle. We then find the perturbation $\\hat{i}(n+1)$ at the start of the next cycle. The system is stable if the magnitude of the ratio $\\alpha = \\frac{\\hat{i}(n+1)}{\\hat{i}(n)}$ is less than $1$.\n\nIn peak CMC with an artificial compensation ramp, the switch turns off when the sum of the sensed inductor current and the ramp reaches a control reference. Let the compensation ramp have an equivalent current slope of $m_{a}$. The turn-off condition is met at time $t_{on} = d_n T_s$ within the cycle:\n$$i_{L,valley}(n) + m_{1} (d_n T_s) = I_{ref} - m_{a} (d_n T_s)$$\nwhere $I_{ref}$ is the control reference current. Let the steady-state (unperturbed) values be $I_{valley}$ and $D T_s$.\nA small perturbation $\\hat{i}(n)$ in the valley current, $i_{L,valley}(n) = I_{valley} + \\hat{i}(n)$, causes a perturbation $\\hat{d}_n T_s$ in the on-time, $d_n T_s = D T_s + \\hat{d}_n T_s$. Assuming $I_{ref}$ is constant for this fast dynamic, the perturbed turn-off equation is:\n$$(I_{valley} + \\hat{i}(n)) + m_{1} (D T_s + \\hat{d}_n T_s) = I_{ref} - m_{a} (DT_s + \\hat{d}_n T_s)$$\nSubtracting the unperturbed steady-state equation, $I_{valley} + m_{1} D T_s = I_{ref} - m_{a} D T_s$, we get the relation for the perturbations:\n$$\\hat{i}(n) + m_{1} \\hat{d}_n T_s = -m_{a} \\hat{d}_n T_s \\implies (m_{1} + m_{a}) \\hat{d}_n T_s = -\\hat{i}(n)$$\nThe inductor current valley at the start of the next cycle, $i_{L,valley}(n+1)$, is the peak current at the end of the on-time minus the drop during the off-time:\n$$i_{L,valley}(n+1) = i_{L,peak}(n) - m_{2} (T_s - d_n T_s)$$\nWith perturbations, this is:\n$$I_{valley} + \\hat{i}(n+1) = (I_{peak} + \\hat{i}_{peak}(n)) - m_{2} (T_s - (D T_s + \\hat{d}_n T_s))$$\nwhere $I_{peak} = I_{valley} + m_1 D T_s$. The peak perturbation is $\\hat{i}_{peak}(n) = \\hat{i}(n) + m_1 \\hat{d}_n T_s$.\nSubstituting and simplifying using the steady-state condition $I_{valley}=I_{peak}-m_2 (T_s - DT_s)$ gives the evolution of the perturbation:\n$$\\hat{i}(n+1) = \\hat{i}_{peak}(n) + m_2 \\hat{d}_n T_s = (\\hat{i}(n) + m_1 \\hat{d}_n T_s) + m_2 \\hat{d}_n T_s = \\hat{i}(n) + (m_1+m_2)\\hat{d}_n T_s$$\nSubstituting $\\hat{d}_n T_s = -\\frac{\\hat{i}(n)}{m_{1} + m_{a}}$:\n$$\\hat{i}(n+1) = \\hat{i}(n) - (m_1+m_2) \\frac{\\hat{i}(n)}{m_{1} + m_{a}} = \\hat{i}(n) \\left( 1 - \\frac{m_1+m_2}{m_1+m_a} \\right)$$\nThe characteristic multiplier is $\\alpha = \\frac{\\hat{i}(n+1)}{\\hat{i}(n)} = \\frac{m_{1}+m_a-m_1-m_2}{m_1+m_a} = \\frac{m_a-m_2}{m_1+m_a}$.\nFor stability, $|\\alpha| < 1$. Subharmonic oscillation occurs when $\\alpha$ approaches $-1$. The stability boundary is at $\\alpha = -1$. To prevent this, we require $\\alpha > -1$:\n$$\\frac{m_a-m_2}{m_1+m_a} > -1 \\implies m_a - m_2 > -(m_1+m_a) \\implies m_a - m_2 > -m_1 - m_a \\implies 2m_a > m_2 - m_1$$\nThe minimum required compensation slope is thus given by the condition:\n$$m_{a} > \\frac{m_{2} - m_{1}}{2}$$\nThis condition must hold for any duty ratio $D$ up to $D_{max}=0.7$. We must express the slopes $m_1$ and $m_2$ in terms of $D$. Assuming a constant input voltage $V_{in}$, we have $V_o = D V_{in}$.\n$$m_{1}(D) = \\frac{V_{in} - D V_{in}}{L} = \\frac{V_{in}(1-D)}{L}$$\n$$m_{2}(D) = \\frac{D V_{in}}{L}$$\nSubstituting these into the stability condition:\n$$m_{a} > \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{D V_{in}}{L} - \\frac{V_{in}(1-D)}{L} \\right) = \\frac{V_{in}}{2L} (D - (1-D)) = \\frac{V_{in}}{2L} (2D-1)$$\nThe required minimum compensation slope is a function of $D$. For $D \\le 0.5$, $2D-1 \\le 0$, so no compensation is required ($m_a > \\text{negative value}$). For $D > 0.5$, compensation is required, and the amount needed increases with $D$. To ensure stability for all $D \\le 0.7$, we must satisfy the condition at the worst-case (largest) duty ratio, $D_{max}=0.7$.\nThe minimum required slope, $m_{a,min}$, is:\n$$m_{a,min} = \\frac{V_{in}}{2L} (2D_{max}-1)$$\nUsing the given values $V_{in}=12\\,\\text{V}$, $L=2 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{H}$, and $D_{max}=0.7$:\n$$m_{a,min} = \\frac{12\\,\\text{V}}{2 \\times (2 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{H})} (2 \\times 0.7 - 1) = \\frac{12}{4 \\times 10^{-6}} (1.4 - 1) = (3 \\times 10^{6}) (0.4)\\,\\text{A/s} = 1.2 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\text{A/s}$$\n\n### Part 3: Compensation Ramp Peak Amplitude\n\nThe compensation slope $m_a$ is an equivalent current slope. It is generated by a voltage ramp with slope $S_a$ added to the sensed current signal. The current-sense gain $K_{s}$ relates the two: $S_a = m_a \\times K_s$.\nThe minimum required voltage slope is therefore:\n$$S_{a,min} = m_{a,min} \\times K_{s} = (1.2 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\text{A/s}) \\times (50 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{V/A}) = 60 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\text{V/s}$$\nThis voltage ramp is generated over one switching period $T_s$. The period is the inverse of the switching frequency: $T_s = \\frac{1}{f_s} = \\frac{1}{500 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{Hz}} = 2 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{s}$.\nThe peak amplitude of the ramp, $V_r$, is the total voltage change over one period. Assuming a linear ramp, $V_r = S_a \\times T_s$.\nThe minimum required ramp peak amplitude $V_{r,min}$ is:\n$$V_{r,min} = S_{a,min} \\times T_s = (60 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\text{V/s}) \\times (2 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{s}) = 120 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{V} = 0.12\\,\\text{V}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $0.1200\\,\\text{V}$.",

Let this error in on-time be $\\Delta T_{on}$:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{on} = \\tau_{d}\n$$\nThe resulting error in the duty cycle, $\\Delta D$, is the ratio of this additional on-time to the total switching period:\n$$\n\\Delta D = \\frac{\\Delta T_{on}}{T_{s}} = \\frac{\\tau_{d}}{T_{s}}\n$$\nSubstituting $T_{s} = 1/f_{s}$, we obtain the duty cycle error in terms of the given parameters:\n$$\n\\Delta D = \\tau_{d} \\cdot f_{s}\n$$\nThe given values are $\\tau_{d} = 50\\,\\text{ns}$ and $f_{s} = 500\\,\\text{kHz}$. We use base SI units for the calculation.\n$$\n\\tau_{d} = 50 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{s}\n$$\n$$\nf_{s} = 500\\,\\text{kHz} = 500 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\text{Hz} = 5 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the equation for $\\Delta D$:\n$$\n\\Delta D = (50 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{s}) \\cdot (5 \\times 10^{5}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}) = 250 \\times 10^{-4} = 0.025\n$$\nThis is a dimensionless quantity. Rounding to four significant figures, the duty cycle error is $0.02500$.\n\nThe final answer is presented as a two-entry row vector containing the effective peak current increase and the duty cycle error, both rounded to four significant figures.",
