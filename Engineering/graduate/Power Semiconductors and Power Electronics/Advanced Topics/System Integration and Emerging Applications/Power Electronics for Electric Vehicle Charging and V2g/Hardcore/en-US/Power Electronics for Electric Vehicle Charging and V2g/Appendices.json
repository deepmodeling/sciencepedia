Analysis of the Constant-Current (CC) Phase**\n\nThe charging process begins at $s_{start} = 0.2$ in the CC mode, with a constant current $I_{\\mathrm{CC}} = 250\\,\\mathrm{A}$. This phase continues until the battery's terminal voltage, $V_t$, reaches the charger's voltage limit, $V_{\\mathrm{CV}} = 400\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n\nAccording to Kirchhoff's Voltage Law applied to the battery model, the terminal voltage is:\n$$\nV_t(s) = V_{\\mathrm{oc}}(s) + I_{\\mathrm{CC}} R\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}(s)$, $I_{\\mathrm{CC}}$, and $R$:\n$$\nV_t(s) = (300 + 120s) + (250\\,\\mathrm{A})(0.05\\,\\Omega) = 300 + 120s + 12.5 = 312.5 + 120s\n$$\nThe CC phase ends at a crossover SOC, $s_{cross}$, where $V_t(s_{cross}) = V_{\\mathrm{CV}}$.\n$$\n400 = 312.5 + 120s_{cross}\n$$\n$$\n120s_{cross} = 400 - 312.5 = 87.5\n$$\n$$\ns_{cross} = \\frac{87.5}{120} = \\frac{175}{240} = \\frac{35}{48}\n$$\nNumerically, $s_{cross} \\approx 0.72917$.

During turn-off of the high-side device, the commutation loop comprising the device leads, busbar, and decoupling paths produces a lumped stray inductance, denoted $L_{\\text{loop}}$. Assume the loop inductance is linear and time-invariant in the relevant current range, the current slew is approximately constant over the turn-off interval, and parasitic capacitances and any clamp networks are negligible for the purpose of deriving the dominant overshoot mechanism.\n\nStarting from Faraday’s law and the lumped-element inductance model, derive an expression for the transient overshoot voltage across the turning-off device in terms of $L_{\\text{loop}}$ and the current slew rate $\\frac{di}{dt}$.

            "solution": "The first task is to derive an expression for the transient overshoot voltage. This derivation starts from Faraday's law of induction applied to a lumped inductor. The voltage, $v_L(t)$, across an inductor with inductance $L$ is given by the relation:\n$$v_L(t) = L \\frac{di(t)}{dt}$$\nwhere $i(t)$ is the current flowing through the inductor.\n\nIn the context of the half-bridge, during the turn-off of the high-side MOSFET, the device current commutates, and its rate of change is rapid. This changing current flows through the parasitic stray inductance of the commutation loop, $L_{\\text{loop}}$. The problem states that the current slew rate, $\\frac{di}{dt}$, is approximately constant during this interval.\n\nThe voltage induced across this stray inductance, according to Faraday's law, is:\n$$v_{\\text{loop}}(t) = L_{\\text{loop}} \\frac{di(t)}{dt}$$\nThis induced voltage acts to oppose the change in current (Lenz's Law). As the current through the turning-off device is decreasing, $\\frac{di}{dt}$ is negative. The induced voltage $v_{\\text{loop}}(t)$ will have a polarity that adds to the DC bus voltage, $V_{\\text{dc}}$, as seen across the drain-source terminals of the MOSFET. This additional voltage is the transient voltage overshoot, denoted as $V_{\\text{os}}$.\n\nThe magnitude of this overshoot voltage is the absolute value of the voltage induced across the loop inductance:\n$$V_{\\text{os}} = |v_{\\text{loop}}(t)| = \\left| L_{\\text{loop}} \\frac{di(t)}{dt} \\right|$$\nSince inductance $L_{\\text{loop}}$ is a positive scalar and the problem provides the current slew rate as a magnitude, we can write the expression for the overshoot voltage as:\n$$V_{\\text{os}} = L_{\\text{loop}} \\left| \\frac{di}{dt} \\right|$$\nFor notational simplicity when dealing with magnitudes, we can write $\\frac{di}{dt}$ to represent the magnitude of the slew rate, yielding:\n$$V_{\\text{os}} = L_{\\text{loop}} \\frac{di}{dt}$$\n\nThe second task is to determine the maximum acceptable value of $L_{\\text{loop}}$, denoted $L_{\\text{loop,max}}$, such that the overshoot $V_{\\text{os}}$ remains below $100\\,\\mathrm{V}$ for a given slew rate.

The maximum acceptable inductance corresponds to the maximum permissible overshoot voltage:\n$$L_{\\text{loop,max}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{os,max}}}{\\frac{di}{dt}}$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$L_{\\text{loop,max}} = \\frac{100\\,\\mathrm{V}}{200 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{A/s}} = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 10^6}\\,\\mathrm{H}$$\n$$L_{\\text{loop,max}} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{H}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in microhenries ($\\mu\\mathrm{H}$).
