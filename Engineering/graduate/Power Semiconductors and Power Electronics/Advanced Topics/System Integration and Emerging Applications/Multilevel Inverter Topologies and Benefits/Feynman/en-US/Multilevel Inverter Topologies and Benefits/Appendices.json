            "problem": "A single-phase Cascaded H-Bridge (CHB) inverter is formed by series-connecting $N$ identical full-bridge cells, each supplied by an isolated direct current (DC) source of voltage $V_{dc}$.

It is formed by summing the outputs of $N$ cells.\n        *   Each cell outputs $+V_{dc}$, $0$, or $-V_{dc}$.\n        *   The total output voltage $v_o(t)$ is therefore a sum of these individual cell voltages.\n        *   The instantaneous output voltage $v_o(t)$ can take values $k \\cdot V_{dc}$ where $k$ is an integer.\n        *   The maximum possible instantaneous voltage is $N \\cdot V_{dc}$. The problem states $|v_o(t)| \\leq N V_{dc}$.\n        *   The Fourier series of a periodic function $f(t)$ with period $T$ is $f(t) = a_0 + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} (a_n \\cos(n\\omega_0 t) + b_n \\sin(n\\omega_0 t))$, where $\\omega_0 = 2\\pi/T$.\n        *   The problem states the gating strategy enforces odd half-wave symmetry on $v_o(t)$.\n            *   Odd half-wave symmetry means $v_o(t + T/2) = -v_o(t)$.\n            *   This implies that the waveform only contains odd harmonics. The DC component $a_0$ is zero, and all even harmonics ($a_{2n}$, $b_{2n}$) are zero. This aligns with the \"zero average over one fundamental period\" statement.\n            *   Specifically for the fundamental component ($n=1$), the coefficients are:\n                *   $a_1 = \\frac{2}{T} \\int_0^T v_o(t) \\cos(\\omega_0 t) dt = \\frac{4}{T} \\int_0^{T/2} v_o(t) \\cos(\\omega_0 t) dt$\n                *   $b_1 = \\frac{2}{T} \\int_0^T v_o(t) \\sin(\\omega_0 t) dt = \\frac{4}{T} \\int_0^{T/2} v_o(t) \\sin(\\omega_0 t) dt$\n        *   The peak amplitude of the fundamental component is $V_{o1,peak} = \\sqrt{a_1^2 + b_1^2}$.\n        *   I need to find the maximum possible value of $V_{o1,peak}$. This is a classic optimization problem. To maximize the fundamental component, the waveform $v_o(t)$ should follow the shape of the fundamental sinusoid as closely as possible.\n        *   Let's assume we want to synthesize a sinusoidal fundamental, so we can choose the phase reference such that $a_1=0$. We aim to maximize $b_1$.\n        *   Then $V_{o1,peak} = |b_1|$. We want to maximize $b_1 = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_0^{\\pi} v_o(\\theta) \\sin(\\theta) d\\theta$, where $\\theta = \\omega_0 t$. (Using angular frequency domain is easier). The integration is from $0$ to $2\\pi$, but due to symmetry, we can integrate from $0$ to $\\pi$ and multiply. $b_1 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} v_o(\\theta) \\sin(\\theta) d\\theta = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_0^{\\pi} v_o(\\theta) \\sin(\\theta) d\\theta$. The problem mentions odd half-wave symmetry, which is $v(\\theta+\\pi) = -v(\\theta)$. Also let's assume quarter-wave symmetry, $v(\\pi-\\theta) = v(\\theta)$. For quarter-wave symmetry, $a_n$ coefficients are zero for all $n$. $b_n = \\frac{4}{\\pi}\\int_0^{\\pi/2} v(\\theta) \\sin(n\\theta) d\\theta$ for odd $n$. The problem states \"odd half-wave symmetry\" and \"zero average\". This implies only odd harmonics. It does not explicitly state quarter-wave symmetry, but this is the standard way to maximize the fundamental and eliminate even harmonics. Let's re-read. \"odd half-wave symmetry\". This means $a_n=b_n=0$ for all even $n$. The DC component is also zero. That's it.\n        *   To maximize the integral $\\int_0^{\\pi} v_o(\\theta) \\sin(\\theta) d\\theta$, the function $v_o(\\theta)$ should be as large as possible when $\\sin(\\theta)$ is positive, and as small as possible when $\\sin(\\theta)$ is negative.\n        *   In the interval $[0, \\pi]$, $\\sin(\\theta)$ is non-negative. So we want to make $v_o(\\theta)$ as large as possible.\n        *   The maximum possible instantaneous voltage is $N V_{dc}$. So, to maximize the integral, we should set $v_o(\\theta) = N V_{dc}$ for $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi]$. And due to odd half-wave symmetry, $v_o(\\theta) = -N V_{dc}$ for $\\theta \\in [\\pi, 2\\pi]$.\n        *   This waveform is a square wave with amplitude $N V_{dc}$.\n        *   Let's check if this waveform is achievable. A single H-bridge can produce $+V_{dc}$, $0$, or $-V_{dc}$. The series combination of $N$ H-bridges can produce any voltage $k \\cdot V_{dc}$ where $k$ is an integer such that $-N \\le k \\le N$. So, producing a constant voltage of $N V_{dc}$ (by having all cells output $+V_{dc}$) is possible.\n        *   So, the optimal waveform $v_o(t)$ to maximize the fundamental is a square wave:\n            $v_o(\\theta) = N V_{dc}$ for $0 < \\theta < \\pi$\n            $v_o(\\theta) = -N V_{dc}$ for $\\pi < \\theta < 2\\pi$\n        *   This waveform has odd half-wave symmetry. It also has zero average. The constraint $|v_o(t)| \\le N V_{dc}$ is satisfied, and in fact, the equality is reached, which makes it the tightest bound.\n        *   Now, calculate the fundamental component amplitude for this square wave.\n            *   Let's find the Fourier series. Since it's an odd function, all $a_n=0$.\n            *   $b_n = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} v_o(\\theta) \\sin(n\\theta) d\\theta = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_0^{\\pi} (N V_{dc}) \\sin(n\\theta) d\\theta$\n            *   $b_n = \\frac{2 N V_{dc}}{\\pi} \\left[ -\\frac{\\cos(n\\theta)}{n} \\right]_0^{\\pi}$\n            *   $b_n = \\frac{2 N V_{dc}}{n\\pi} [-\\cos(n\\pi) - (-\\cos(0))] = \\frac{2 N V_{dc}}{n\\pi} [1 - \\cos(n\\pi)]$\n            *   For odd $n$, $\\cos(n\\pi) = -1$, so $b_n = \\frac{2 N V_{dc}}{n\\pi} [1 - (-1)] = \\frac{4 N V_{dc}}{n\\pi}$.\n            *   For even $n$, $\\cos(n\\pi) = 1$, so $b_n = 0$. This confirms the odd half-wave symmetry property.\n        *   The fundamental component corresponds to $n=1$.\n        *   The peak amplitude is $V_{o1,peak} = |b_1| = \\frac{4}{\\pi} N V_{dc}$. This is the tight upper bound.\n\n    *   **Part 2: Convert this peak amplitude to the RMS value.**\n        *   For a sinusoidal quantity, the RMS value is the peak value divided by $\\sqrt{2}$.\n        *   $V_{o1,rms} = \\frac{V_{o1,peak}}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( \\frac{4}{\\pi} N V_{dc} \\right) = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{2}\\pi} N V_{dc} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{\\pi} N V_{dc}$.\n\n    *   **Part 3: Determine the general expression for the number of distinct static output voltage levels.**\n        *   Each of the $N$ cells can produce 3 distinct voltage levels: $-V_{dc}$, $0$, $+V_{dc}$. Let's denote the output of cell $i$ as $v_i$.\n        *   The total output voltage is $v_o = \\sum_{i=1}^N v_i$.\n        *   Let $n_+$ be the number of cells outputting $+V_{dc}$.\n        *   Let $n_-$ be the number of cells outputting $-V_{dc}$.\n        *   Let $n_0$ be the number of cells outputting $0$.\n        *   We have $n_+ + n_- + n_0 = N$.\n        *   The output voltage is $v_o = n_+ (+V_{dc}) + n_- (-V_{dc}) + n_0 (0) = (n_+ - n_-) V_{dc}$.\n        *   Let $k = n_+ - n_-$. We need to find the possible values of $k$.\n        *   Since $0 \\le n_+ \\le N$ and $0 \\le n_- \\le N$, and $n_+ + n_- \\le N$.\n        *   The minimum value of $k$ occurs when $n_+ = 0$ and $n_-$ is maximized. With $n_+=0$, we can have at most $n_- = N$. In this case, $k = 0 - N = -N$.\n        *   The maximum value of $k$ occurs when $n_-$ is minimized ($n_-=0$) and $n_+$ is maximized. With $n_-=0$, we can have at most $n_+ = N$. In this case, $k = N - 0 = N$.\n        *   Can $k$ take all integer values between $-N$ and $N$?\n        *   Let's see if we can form $k-1$ from $k$. Suppose we have $k = n_+ - n_-$.\n        *   If $n_+ > 0$, we can switch one cell from $+V_{dc}$ to $0$. Then $n_+' = n_+-1$, $n_-'=n_-$, $n_0'=n_0+1$. The new sum $n_+'+n_-'+n_0' = (n_+-1)+n_-+(n_0+1) = N$. The new voltage is $((n_+-1) - n_-)V_{dc} = (k-1)V_{dc}$.\n        *   If $n_+=0$, then $k = -n_-$. This means $k \\le 0$. If we want $k-1$, we need to convert a cell from $0$ to $-V_{dc}$. This is possible if $n_0 > 0$. If $n_+=0$ and $n_0=0$, then $n_-=N$ and $k=-N$. This is the minimum value. We cannot get $k-1=-N-1$.\n        *   So, starting from $k=N$ (where $n_+=N, n_-=0, n_0=0$), we can sequentially switch one cell from $+V_{dc}$ to $0$ to get all values down to $k=0$ (where $n_+=0, n_-=0, n_0=N$). Then, from $k=0$, we can sequentially switch one cell from $0$ to $-V_{dc}$ to get all values down to $k=-N$ (where $n_+=0, n_-=N, n_0=0$).\n        *   So yes, $k$ can take any integer value from $-N$ to $N$.\n        *   The possible voltage levels are $-N V_{dc}, (-N+1)V_{dc}, \\dots, -V_{dc}, 0, +V_{dc}, \\dots, (N-1)V_{dc}, N V_{dc}$.\n        *   The number of distinct levels is the number of integers from $-N$ to $N$, inclusive.\n        *   Number of levels = $N - (-N) + 1 = 2N + 1$.\n        *   Let's check the logic again. The problem states \"each cell can generate an instantaneous output of $+V_{dc}$, $0$, or $-V_{dc}$\". This setup is often called a symmetric multilevel inverter. The number of levels is indeed $2N+1$. This formula is standard for this topology.\n\n    *   **Part 4: Computations for $N=5$ and $V_{dc}=100$.**\n        *   $N=5$.\n        *   $V_{dc} = 100$ V.\n        *   **Maximum achievable RMS value of the fundamental component:**\n            *   $V_{o1,rms} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{\\pi} N V_{dc}$\n            *   $V_{o1,rms} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{\\pi} (5) (100) = \\frac{1000\\sqrt{2}}{\\pi}$ V.\n            *   Now calculate the numerical value and round to four significant figures.\n            *   $\\pi \\approx 3.14159265$\n            *   $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.41421356$\n            *   $V_{o1,rms} \\approx \\frac{1000 \\times 1.41421356}{3.14159265} \\approx \\frac{1414.21356}{3.14159265} \\approx 450.158...$ V.\n            *   Rounding to four significant figures: $450.2$ V.\n\n        *   **Number of distinct output voltage levels:**\n            *   Number of levels = $2N + 1$.\n            *   Number of levels = $2(5) + 1 = 11$.\n\n3.  **Final Answer Formatting**:\n    *   The final answer should be a two-entry row matrix.\n    *   First entry: $450.2$.\n    *   Second entry: $11$.\n    *   The LaTeX format will be `\\begin{pmatrix} 450.2 & 11 \\end{pmatrix}`.",

A solution will be derived based on the provided information.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Phase-to-Neutral Output Voltages**\n\nAn $m$-level inverter can generate $m$ distinct voltage levels. The problem specifies a symmetric NPC inverter with the neutral point at the midpoint of the total DC link voltage, $V_{dc}$. The DC link is supported by $m-1$ series-connected capacitors.\n\nGiven $m=7$, the number of capacitors is $m-1 = 7-1 = 6$.\nThese $6$ capacitors partition the total DC link voltage $V_{dc} = 600\\,\\mathrm{V}$. Since the capacitors are assumed to have equal voltage, the voltage across each capacitor, $V_{cap}$, is:\n$$V_{cap} = \\frac{V_{dc}}{m-1} = \\frac{600\\,\\mathrm{V}}{7-1} = \\frac{600\\,\\mathrm{V}}{6} = 100\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nThe neutral point, $N$, is the reference ($0\\,\\mathrm{V}$). The total DC link spans symmetrically from a positive rail to a negative rail relative to this neutral. The voltage of the positive rail is $+\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$ and the negative rail is $-\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$.\nWith $V_{dc} = 600\\,\\mathrm{V}$, the rails are at $+300\\,\\mathrm{V}$ and $-300\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n\nThe $m-1=6$ capacitors create $m=7$ tap points for the output phase terminal (let's say, phase 'a'). The voltages of these tap points relative to the neutral point, $v_{aN}$, represent the possible instantaneous phase-to-neutral output voltages. These levels are spaced by $V_{cap}$.\n\nFor a symmetric $m$-level inverter, the voltage levels $v_k$ can be expressed as:\n$$v_k = k \\cdot V_{step} \\quad \\text{where} \\quad V_{step} = \\frac{V_{dc}}{m-1}$$\nThe index $k$ ranges from $-\\frac{m-1}{2}$ to $+\\frac{m-1}{2}$ in integer steps.\nFor $m=7$, $k$ takes values in the set $\\{-\\frac{6}{2}, \\dots, \\frac{6}{2}\\} = \\{-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\\}$.\n\nThe distinct phase-to-neutral voltage levels are:\n- For $k=-3$: $v_{-3} = -3 \\cdot (100\\,\\mathrm{V}) = -300\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n- For $k=-2$: $v_{-2} = -2 \\cdot (100\\,\\mathrm{V}) = -200\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n- For $k=-1$: $v_{-1} = -1 \\cdot (100\\,\\mathrm{V}) = -100\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n- For $k=0$: $v_{0} = 0 \\cdot (100\\,\\mathrm{V}) = 0\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n- For $k=1$: $v_{1} = 1 \\cdot (100\\,\\mathrm{V}) = 100\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n- For $k=2$: $v_{2} = 2 \\cdot (100\\,\\mathrm{V}) = 200\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n- For $k=3$: $v_{3} = 3 \\cdot (100\\,\\mathrm{V}) = 300\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n\nThus, the set of $7$ realizable phase-to-neutral voltages is $\\{-300, -200, -100, 0, 100, 200, 300\\}\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n\n**Part 2: Maximum Peak Fundamental Line-to-Line Voltage**\n\nThe problem states that the inverter operates in the linear modulation region, where the instantaneous magnitude of the sinusoidal reference does not exceed the rail limits. The rail limits for the phase-to-neutral voltage are the maximum and minimum available DC levels, which are $+\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$ and $-\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$.\n\nLet $v_{ph,ref}(t) = \\hat{V}_{ph,ref} \\sin(\\omega t)$ be the sinusoidal reference for a phase voltage. The condition for linear modulation is $|v_{ph,ref}(t)| \\leq \\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$ for all $t$. This implies that the peak amplitude of the reference, $\\hat{V}_{ph,ref}$, must satisfy:\n$$\\hat{V}_{ph,ref} \\leq \\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$$\nThe problem also states that for the given modulation, the commanded fundamental amplitude equals the reference amplitude. Therefore, the peak amplitude of the fundamental component of the phase-to-neutral output voltage, $\\hat{V}_{ph,fund}$, is equal to $\\hat{V}_{ph,ref}$.\n\nThe maximum achievable peak fundamental phase-to-neutral voltage, $\\hat{V}_{ph,max}$, is thus limited by the DC rail:\n$$\\hat{V}_{ph,max} = \\frac{V_{dc}}{2} = \\frac{600\\,\\mathrm{V}}{2} = 300\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\n\nFor a balanced, symmetric three-phase system, the fundamental line-to-line voltages (e.g., $v_{ab}$) are related to the fundamental phase-to-neutral voltages (e.g., $v_{aN}$, $v_{bN}$) by a magnitude scaling of $\\sqrt{3}$ and a phase shift of $30^\\circ$. The relationship between the peak amplitudes is:\n$$\\hat{V}_{LL,fund} = \\sqrt{3} \\cdot \\hat{V}_{ph,fund}$$\nwhere $\\hat{V}_{LL,fund}$ is the peak amplitude of the fundamental line-to-line voltage.\n\nTo find the maximum achievable peak amplitude of the fundamental line-to-line voltage, $\\hat{V}_{LL,max}$, we use the maximum peak phase voltage, $\\hat{V}_{ph,max}$:\n$$\\hat{V}_{LL,max} = \\sqrt{3} \\cdot \\hat{V}_{ph,max}$$\nSubstituting the value of $\\hat{V}_{ph,max}$:\n$$\\hat{V}_{LL,max} = \\sqrt{3} \\cdot (300\\,\\mathrm{V}) = 300\\sqrt{3}\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\n\n**Summary of Results**\nThe seven discrete phase-to-neutral voltage levels are $-300, -200, -100, 0, 100, 200, 300$, all in volts.\nThe maximum peak line-to-line fundamental voltage is $300\\sqrt{3}\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\nThe problem requires these $8$ values to be presented in a single ordered row matrix.",

Each phase-leg can assume one of three pole voltages relative to the midpoint of the direct-current bus: $+V_{\\text{dc}}/2$, $0$, or $-V_{\\text{dc}}/2$. The reference objective is a balanced sinusoidal set of phase voltages with fundamental peak line-to-neutral amplitude $V_{1,\\text{phase,peak}}$.\n\nDefine the modulation index as $m_a \\equiv V_{1,\\text{phase,peak}}/(V_{\\text{dc}}/2)$. Without invoking any pre-derived modulation limits, use first principles to characterize the convex polygon of feasible average space vectors generated by this inverter under SVM, and determine the radius of its largest inscribed circle. Using that geometric characterization and the Clarke transform relationship between phase voltages and the space vector, identify the boundary of the linear modulation region (i.e., the condition for which a rotating sinusoidal reference is reproduced exactly by time-averaging of feasible vectors without saturating on a side of the polygon) and compute the maximum achievable modulation index $m_a$ that does not enter overmodulation.\n\nExpress the final result for $m_a$ as a simplified exact analytical expression. The modulation index is dimensionless; no rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the maximum modulation index, $m_a$, for a three-phase, $3$-level Neutral-Point Clamped (NPC) inverter operating in the linear modulation region of Space Vector Modulation (SVM). This will be accomplished by first characterizing the geometric space of achievable voltage vectors and then relating this to the desired sinusoidal output voltages.\n\nThe inverter has a DC-bus voltage of $V_{\\text{dc}}$. The three phase-legs (a, b, c) can each connect their output terminal to one of three voltage levels relative to the DC-bus midpoint (O): $+V_{\\text{dc}}/2$, $0$, or $-V_{\\text{dc}}/2$. We can represent these switching states for each phase $k \\in \\{a, b, c\\}$ by a variable $s_k \\in \\{1, 0, -1\\}$, such that the pole voltage is $v_{kO} = s_k \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}}{2}$. With three phases and three levels per phase, there are $3^3 = 27$ possible switching state combinations $(s_a, s_b, s_c)$.\n\nThe relationship between the three pole voltages and the corresponding space vector $\\vec{v}_s$ is defined by the Clarke transform. Using the standard amplitude-preserving form for space vector analysis:\n$$ \\vec{v}_s = v_{\\alpha} + jv_{\\beta} = \\frac{2}{3} (v_{aO} + a v_{bO} + a^2 v_{cO}) $$\nwhere $a = \\exp(j2\\pi/3) = -1/2 + j\\sqrt{3}/2$ is the complex space operator.\nSubstituting the pole voltage expressions gives:\n$$ \\vec{v}_s = \\frac{2}{3} \\left( s_a \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}}{2} + a s_b \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}}{2} + a^2 s_c \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}}{2} \\right) = \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}}{3} (s_a + a s_b + a^2 s_c) $$\nWe can now map all $27$ switching states to their corresponding vectors in the complex plane. These instantaneous vectors can be categorized by their magnitude.\nLet's analyze the key vectors that form the boundary of the feasible operating region. These are the \"large vectors\". Consider the switching state $(s_a, s_b, s_c) = (1, -1, -1)$. The resulting space vector is:\n$$ \\vec{v}_s = \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}}{3} (1 - a - a^2) $$\nUsing the property $1 + a + a^2 = 0$, which implies $-a-a^2=1$, we get:\n$$ \\vec{v}_s = \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}}{3} (1 + 1) = \\frac{2V_{\\text{dc}}}{3} $$\nThis vector lies on the positive real axis. There are six such \"large vectors\" corresponding to the switching state permutations where one phase is at one extreme voltage and the other two are at the opposite extreme. Let's list their states and resulting vectors:\n*   $(1, -1, -1) \\rightarrow \\vec{v}_s = \\frac{2V_{\\text{dc}}}{3}$\n*   $(1, 1, -1) \\rightarrow \\vec{v}_s = \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}}{3}(1+a-a^2) = \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}}{3}(1+a - (-1-a)) = \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}}{3}(2+2a) = \\frac{2V_{\\text{dc}}}{3}(1+a) = \\frac{2V_{\\text{dc}}}{3}(-a^2) = \\frac{2V_{\\text{dc}}}{3}\\exp(j\\pi/3)$\n*   $(-1, 1, -1) \\rightarrow \\vec{v}_s = \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}}{3}(-1+a-a^2) = \\frac{2V_{\\text{dc}}}{3}\\exp(j2\\pi/3)$\n*   $(-1, 1, 1) \\rightarrow \\vec{v}_s = \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}}{3}(-1+a+a^2) = -\\frac{2V_{\\text{dc}}}{3} = \\frac{2V_{\\text{dc}}}{3}\\exp(j\\pi)$\n*   $(-1, -1, 1) \\rightarrow \\vec{v}_s = \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}}{3}(-1-a+a^2) = \\frac{2V_{\\text{dc}}}{3}\\exp(j4\\pi/3)$\n*   $(1, -1, 1) \\rightarrow \\vec{v}_s = \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}}{3}(1-a+a^2) = \\frac{2V_{\\text{dc}}}{3}\\exp(j5\\pi/3)$\nThese six large vectors all have a magnitude of $\\frac{2V_{\\text{dc}}}{3}$ and are separated by angles of $\\pi/3$ ($60^\\circ$). They form the vertices of a regular hexagon centered at the origin. Other switching states produce \"medium\", \"small\", and \"zero\" vectors, all of which lie within or on the boundary of this large hexagon.\n\nThe convex polygon of feasible average space vectors is the convex hull of all possible instantaneous vectors. This region is therefore the large hexagon defined by the six large vectors. Any desired reference vector $\\vec{v}_{ref}$ inside this hexagon can be synthesized by time-averaging the three nearest instantaneous vectors.\n\nFor linear modulation, the trajectory of the reference vector must remain within the operating region at all times. The reference vector for a balanced sinusoidal output tracks a circular path. To avoid distortion (overmodulation), this circular path must be fully contained within the hexagonal boundary. The largest possible circle that fits inside the hexagon is its inscribed circle. The radius of this circle, $r_{in}$, determines the maximum magnitude of the reference vector.\n\nA regular hexagon with vertices at a distance $R_{vert}$ from the center has an inscribed circle radius (apothem) of $r_{in} = R_{vert} \\cos(\\pi/6) = R_{vert} \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\nIn our case, the vertex distance is $R_{vert} = \\frac{2V_{\\text{dc}}}{3}$. Therefore, the radius of the largest inscribed circle is:\n$$ r_{in} = \\left(\\frac{2V_{\\text{dc}}}{3}\\right) \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}}{\\sqrt{3}} $$\nThis is the maximum magnitude of a reference voltage vector that can be synthesized without distortion. $|\\vec{v}_{ref}|_{max} = r_{in}$.\n\nNext, we must relate the magnitude of the reference space vector to the peak phase voltage, $V_{1,\\text{phase,peak}}$. The reference is a balanced set of sinusoidal phase voltages (line-to-neutral):\n$$ v_{aN,ref}(t) = V_{1,\\text{phase,peak}} \\cos(\\omega t) $$\n$$ v_{bN,ref}(t) = V_{1,\\text{phase,peak}} \\cos(\\omega t - 2\\pi/3) $$\n$$ v_{cN,ref}(t) = V_{1,\\text{phase,peak}} \\cos(\\omega t - 4\\pi/3) $$\nFor a balanced system, the sum of phase voltages is zero, so their zero-sequence component is zero. This allows us to equate the reference phase voltages $v_{kN,ref}$ with the reference pole voltages $v_{kO,ref}$. The reference space vector $\\vec{v}_{ref}(t)$ is obtained by applying the Clarke transform to these voltages:\n$$ \\vec{v}_{ref}(t) = \\frac{2}{3} (v_{aN,ref} + a v_{bN,ref} + a^2 v_{cN,ref}) $$\n$$ \\vec{v}_{ref}(t) = \\frac{2}{3} V_{1,\\text{phase,peak}} \\left[ \\cos(\\omega t) + a \\cos(\\omega t - 2\\pi/3) + a^2 \\cos(\\omega t - 4\\pi/3) \\right] $$\nUsing Euler's formula, $\\cos\\theta = (\\exp(j\\theta) + \\exp(-j\\theta))/2$, and the definition of $a = \\exp(j2\\pi/3)$, the term in the brackets can be simplified:\n$$ \\cos(\\omega t) + a \\cos(\\omega t - 2\\pi/3) + a^2 \\cos(\\omega t - 4\\pi/3) = \\frac{3}{2} \\exp(j\\omega t) $$\nSubstituting this identity back into the expression for $\\vec{v}_{ref}(t)$:\n$$ \\vec{v}_{ref}(t) = \\frac{2}{3} V_{1,\\text{phase,peak}} \\left( \\frac{3}{2} \\exp(j\\omega t) \\right) = V_{1,\\text{phase,peak}} \\exp(j\\omega t) $$\nThis shows that the reference space vector is a vector of constant magnitude $|\\vec{v}_{ref}| = V_{1,\\text{phase,peak}}$, rotating at an angular frequency $\\omega$.\n\nThe boundary of the linear modulation region is reached when the magnitude of the reference vector equals the radius of the inscribed circle:\n$$ |\\vec{v}_{ref}|_{max} = V_{1,\\text{phase,peak,max}} = r_{in} = \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}}{\\sqrt{3}} $$\nThe problem defines the modulation index as $m_a \\equiv V_{1,\\text{phase,peak}}/(V_{\\text{dc}}/2)$. The maximum modulation index, $m_{a,max}$, is thus:\n$$ m_{a,max} = \\frac{V_{1,\\text{phase,peak,max}}}{V_{\\text{dc}}/2} = \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}/\\sqrt{3}}{V_{\\text{dc}}/2} $$\n$$ m_{a,max} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} $$",
