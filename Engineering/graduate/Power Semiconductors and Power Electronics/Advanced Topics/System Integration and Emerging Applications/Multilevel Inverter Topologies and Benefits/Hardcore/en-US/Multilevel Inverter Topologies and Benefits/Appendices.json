            "introduction": "The first step in analyzing any multilevel inverter is to determine its fundamental capabilities. This practice focuses on the popular Cascaded H-Bridge (CHB) topology, exploring the direct link between its structure and performance. By deriving the number of distinct output voltage levels and the theoretical maximum AC voltage, you will gain a core understanding of how the number of cells $N$ and the DC source voltage $V_{dc}$ define the inverter's operating range.

            "problem": "A single-phase Cascaded H-Bridge (CHB) inverter is formed by series-connecting $N$ identical full-bridge cells, each supplied by an isolated direct current (DC) source of voltage $V_{dc}$. Each cell can generate an instantaneous output of $+V_{dc}$, $0$, or $-V_{dc}$ across its terminals. The series combination produces the phase output voltage $v_{o}(t)$ across the load. Assume ideal switches (zero on-state drop, infinite off resistance), negligible dead-time, and a gating strategy that enforces odd half-wave symmetry on $v_{o}(t)$ and zero average over one fundamental period. The switching is restricted such that $|v_{o}(t)| \\leq N V_{dc}$ at all times.\n\nStarting from the Fourier series definition of the fundamental component and the stated amplitude constraint, derive a tight upper bound for the peak amplitude of the fundamental component of $v_{o}(t)$, expressed as an analytic function of $N$ and $V_{dc}$. Then, convert this peak amplitude to the root-mean-square (RMS) value. Finally, determine the general expression for the number of distinct static output voltage levels the CHB can produce under the stated per-cell capabilities and evaluate it for the given $N$.\n\nTake $N=5$ and $V_{dc}=100$.

            "solution": "The user wants me to solve a problem about a single-phase Cascaded H-Bridge (CHB) inverter.\n\nHere's my plan:\n1.  **Validate the Problem**: I'll meticulously check the problem statement against my validation criteria.\n    *   **Step 1: Extract Givens**: I'll list all the given information verbatim.\n    *   **Step 2: Validate**: I'll check for scientific soundness, well-posedness, objectivity, completeness, etc.\n    *   **Step 3: Verdict**: I'll decide if the problem is valid or not.\n\n2.  **Solve the Problem (if valid)**:\n    *   **Part 1: Derive the upper bound for the peak amplitude of the fundamental component.**\n        *   The output voltage is $v_o(t)$. It is formed by summing the outputs of $N$ cells.\n        *   Each cell outputs $+V_{dc}$, $0$, or $-V_{dc}$.\n        *   The total output voltage $v_o(t)$ is therefore a sum of these individual cell voltages.\n        *   The instantaneous output voltage $v_o(t)$ can take values $k \\cdot V_{dc}$ where $k$ is an integer.\n        *   The maximum possible instantaneous voltage is $N \\cdot V_{dc}$. The problem states $|v_o(t)| \\leq N V_{dc}$.\n        *   The Fourier series of a periodic function $f(t)$ with period $T$ is $f(t) = a_0 + \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} (a_n \\cos(n\\omega_0 t) + b_n \\sin(n\\omega_0 t))$, where $\\omega_0 = 2\\pi/T$.\n        *   The problem states the gating strategy enforces odd half-wave symmetry on $v_o(t)$.\n            *   Odd half-wave symmetry means $v_o(t + T/2) = -v_o(t)$.\n            *   This implies that the waveform only contains odd harmonics. The DC component $a_0$ is zero, and all even harmonics ($a_{2n}$, $b_{2n}$) are zero. This aligns with the \"zero average over one fundamental period\" statement.\n            *   Specifically for the fundamental component ($n=1$), the coefficients are:\n                *   $a_1 = \\frac{2}{T} \\int_0^T v_o(t) \\cos(\\omega_0 t) dt = \\frac{4}{T} \\int_0^{T/2} v_o(t) \\cos(\\omega_0 t) dt$\n                *   $b_1 = \\frac{2}{T} \\int_0^T v_o(t) \\sin(\\omega_0 t) dt = \\frac{4}{T} \\int_0^{T/2} v_o(t) \\sin(\\omega_0 t) dt$\n        *   The peak amplitude of the fundamental component is $V_{o1,peak} = \\sqrt{a_1^2 + b_1^2}$.\n        *   I need to find the maximum possible value of $V_{o1,peak}$. This is a classic optimization problem. To maximize the fundamental component, the waveform $v_o(t)$ should follow the shape of the fundamental sinusoid as closely as possible.\n        *   Let's assume we want to synthesize a sinusoidal fundamental, so we can choose the phase reference such that $a_1=0$. We aim to maximize $b_1$.\n        *   Then $V_{o1,peak} = |b_1|$. We want to maximize $b_1 = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_0^{\\pi} v_o(\\theta) \\sin(\\theta) d\\theta$, where $\\theta = \\omega_0 t$. (Using angular frequency domain is easier). The integration is from $0$ to $2\\pi$, but due to symmetry, we can integrate from $0$ to $\\pi$ and multiply. $b_1 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} v_o(\\theta) \\sin(\\theta) d\\theta = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_0^{\\pi} v_o(\\theta) \\sin(\\theta) d\\theta$. The problem mentions odd half-wave symmetry, which is $v(\\theta+\\pi) = -v(\\theta)$. Also let's assume quarter-wave symmetry, $v(\\pi-\\theta) = v(\\theta)$. For quarter-wave symmetry, $a_n$ coefficients are zero for all $n$. $b_n = \\frac{4}{\\pi}\\int_0^{\\pi/2} v(\\theta) \\sin(n\\theta) d\\theta$ for odd $n$. The problem states \"odd half-wave symmetry\" and \"zero average\". This implies only odd harmonics. It does not explicitly state quarter-wave symmetry, but this is the standard way to maximize the fundamental and eliminate even harmonics. Let's re-read. \"odd half-wave symmetry\". This means $a_n=b_n=0$ for all even $n$. The DC component is also zero. That's it.\n        *   To maximize the integral $\\int_0^{\\pi} v_o(\\theta) \\sin(\\theta) d\\theta$, the function $v_o(\\theta)$ should be as large as possible when $\\sin(\\theta)$ is positive, and as small as possible when $\\sin(\\theta)$ is negative.\n        *   In the interval $[0, \\pi]$, $\\sin(\\theta)$ is non-negative. So we want to make $v_o(\\theta)$ as large as possible.\n        *   The maximum possible instantaneous voltage is $N V_{dc}$. So, to maximize the integral, we should set $v_o(\\theta) = N V_{dc}$ for $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi]$. And due to odd half-wave symmetry, $v_o(\\theta) = -N V_{dc}$ for $\\theta \\in [\\pi, 2\\pi]$.\n        *   This waveform is a square wave with amplitude $N V_{dc}$.\n        *   Let's check if this waveform is achievable. A single H-bridge can produce $+V_{dc}$, $0$, or $-V_{dc}$. The series combination of $N$ H-bridges can produce any voltage $k \\cdot V_{dc}$ where $k$ is an integer such that $-N \\le k \\le N$. So, producing a constant voltage of $N V_{dc}$ (by having all cells output $+V_{dc}$) is possible.\n        *   So, the optimal waveform $v_o(t)$ to maximize the fundamental is a square wave:\n            $v_o(\\theta) = N V_{dc}$ for $0 < \\theta < \\pi$\n            $v_o(\\theta) = -N V_{dc}$ for $\\pi < \\theta < 2\\pi$\n        *   This waveform has odd half-wave symmetry. It also has zero average. The constraint $|v_o(t)| \\le N V_{dc}$ is satisfied, and in fact, the equality is reached, which makes it the tightest bound.\n        *   Now, calculate the fundamental component amplitude for this square wave.\n            *   Let's find the Fourier series. Since it's an odd function, all $a_n=0$.\n            *   $b_n = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} v_o(\\theta) \\sin(n\\theta) d\\theta = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_0^{\\pi} (N V_{dc}) \\sin(n\\theta) d\\theta$\n            *   $b_n = \\frac{2 N V_{dc}}{\\pi} \\left[ -\\frac{\\cos(n\\theta)}{n} \\right]_0^{\\pi}$\n            *   $b_n = \\frac{2 N V_{dc}}{n\\pi} [-\\cos(n\\pi) - (-\\cos(0))] = \\frac{2 N V_{dc}}{n\\pi} [1 - \\cos(n\\pi)]$\n            *   For odd $n$, $\\cos(n\\pi) = -1$, so $b_n = \\frac{2 N V_{dc}}{n\\pi} [1 - (-1)] = \\frac{4 N V_{dc}}{n\\pi}$.\n            *   For even $n$, $\\cos(n\\pi) = 1$, so $b_n = 0$. This confirms the odd half-wave symmetry property.\n        *   The fundamental component corresponds to $n=1$.\n        *   The peak amplitude is $V_{o1,peak} = |b_1| = \\frac{4}{\\pi} N V_{dc}$. This is the tight upper bound.\n\n    *   **Part 2: Convert this peak amplitude to the RMS value.**\n        *   For a sinusoidal quantity, the RMS value is the peak value divided by $\\sqrt{2}$.\n        *   $V_{o1,rms} = \\frac{V_{o1,peak}}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( \\frac{4}{\\pi} N V_{dc} \\right) = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{2}\\pi} N V_{dc} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{\\pi} N V_{dc}$.\n\n    *   **Part 3: Determine the general expression for the number of distinct static output voltage levels.**\n        *   Each of the $N$ cells can produce 3 distinct voltage levels: $-V_{dc}$, $0$, $+V_{dc}$. Let's denote the output of cell $i$ as $v_i$.\n        *   The total output voltage is $v_o = \\sum_{i=1}^N v_i$.\n        *   Let $n_+$ be the number of cells outputting $+V_{dc}$.\n        *   Let $n_-$ be the number of cells outputting $-V_{dc}$.\n        *   Let $n_0$ be the number of cells outputting $0$.\n        *   We have $n_+ + n_- + n_0 = N$.\n        *   The output voltage is $v_o = n_+ (+V_{dc}) + n_- (-V_{dc}) + n_0 (0) = (n_+ - n_-) V_{dc}$.\n        *   Let $k = n_+ - n_-$. We need to find the possible values of $k$.\n        *   Since $0 \\le n_+ \\le N$ and $0 \\le n_- \\le N$, and $n_+ + n_- \\le N$.\n        *   The minimum value of $k$ occurs when $n_+ = 0$ and $n_-$ is maximized. With $n_+=0$, we can have at most $n_- = N$. In this case, $k = 0 - N = -N$.\n        *   The maximum value of $k$ occurs when $n_-$ is minimized ($n_-=0$) and $n_+$ is maximized. With $n_-=0$, we can have at most $n_+ = N$. In this case, $k = N - 0 = N$.\n        *   Can $k$ take all integer values between $-N$ and $N$?\n        *   Let's see if we can form $k-1$ from $k$. Suppose we have $k = n_+ - n_-$.\n        *   If $n_+ > 0$, we can switch one cell from $+V_{dc}$ to $0$. Then $n_+' = n_+-1$, $n_-'=n_-$, $n_0'=n_0+1$. The new sum $n_+'+n_-'+n_0' = (n_+-1)+n_-+(n_0+1) = N$. The new voltage is $((n_+-1) - n_-)V_{dc} = (k-1)V_{dc}$.\n        *   If $n_+=0$, then $k = -n_-$. This means $k \\le 0$. If we want $k-1$, we need to convert a cell from $0$ to $-V_{dc}$. This is possible if $n_0 > 0$. If $n_+=0$ and $n_0=0$, then $n_-=N$ and $k=-N$. This is the minimum value. We cannot get $k-1=-N-1$.\n        *   So, starting from $k=N$ (where $n_+=N, n_-=0, n_0=0$), we can sequentially switch one cell from $+V_{dc}$ to $0$ to get all values down to $k=0$ (where $n_+=0, n_-=0, n_0=N$). Then, from $k=0$, we can sequentially switch one cell from $0$ to $-V_{dc}$ to get all values down to $k=-N$ (where $n_+=0, n_-=N, n_0=0$).\n        *   So yes, $k$ can take any integer value from $-N$ to $N$.\n        *   The possible voltage levels are $-N V_{dc}, (-N+1)V_{dc}, \\dots, -V_{dc}, 0, +V_{dc}, \\dots, (N-1)V_{dc}, N V_{dc}$.\n        *   The number of distinct levels is the number of integers from $-N$ to $N$, inclusive.\n        *   Number of levels = $N - (-N) + 1 = 2N + 1$.\n        *   Let's check the logic again. The problem states \"each cell can generate an instantaneous output of $+V_{dc}$, $0$, or $-V_{dc}$\". This setup is often called a symmetric multilevel inverter. The number of levels is indeed $2N+1$. This formula is standard for this topology.\n\n    *   **Part 4: Computations for $N=5$ and $V_{dc}=100$.**\n        *   $N=5$.\n        *   $V_{dc} = 100$ V.\n        *   **Maximum achievable RMS value of the fundamental component:**\n            *   $V_{o1,rms} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{\\pi} N V_{dc}$\n            *   $V_{o1,rms} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{\\pi} (5) (100) = \\frac{1000\\sqrt{2}}{\\pi}$ V.\n            *   Now calculate the numerical value and round to four significant figures.\n            *   $\\pi \\approx 3.14159265$\n            *   $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.41421356$\n            *   $V_{o1,rms} \\approx \\frac{1000 \\times 1.41421356}{3.14159265} \\approx \\frac{1414.21356}{3.14159265} \\approx 450.158...$ V.\n            *   Rounding to four significant figures: $450.2$ V.\n\n        *   **Number of distinct output voltage levels:**\n            *   Number of levels = $2N + 1$.\n            *   Number of levels = $2(5) + 1 = 11$.\n\n3.  **Final Answer Formatting**:\n    *   The final answer should be a two-entry row matrix.\n    *   First entry: $450.2$.\n    *   Second entry: $11$.\n    *   The LaTeX format will be `\\begin{pmatrix} 450.2 & 11 \\end{pmatrix}`.\n\nLet's double-check the validation before proceeding.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n-   Topology: Single-phase Cascaded H-Bridge (CHB) inverter.\n-   Number of cells: $N$.\n-   Cell structure: Identical full-bridge cells.\n-   Cell DC source: Isolated, voltage $V_{dc}$.\n-   Cell output levels: $+V_{dc}$, $0$, or $-V_{dc}$.\n-   Total output voltage: $v_{o}(t)$, series combination of cell outputs.\n-   Switches: Ideal (zero on-state drop, infinite off resistance), negligible dead-time.\n-   Gating strategy constraints:\n    -   Odd half-wave symmetry on $v_{o}(t)$.\n    -   Zero average $v_{o}(t)$ over one fundamental period.\n-   Voltage constraint: $|v_{o}(t)| \\leq N V_{dc}$ at all times.\n-   Specific values: $N=5$, $V_{dc}=100$.\n-   Required computations:\n    1.

The principles of Fourier analysis and circuit theory are correctly invoked. This is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem asks for a maximum value and a count, both of which are uniquely defined by the given constraints. The derivation of the maximum requires finding an optimal waveform, which exists. The calculation of levels is a combinatorial problem with a unique solution. The problem seems well-posed.\n-   **Objective**: The language is precise and technical (\"odd half-wave symmetry\", \"root-mean-square\", \"Fourier series\"). No subjective or opinion-based statements.\n-   **Completeness**: All necessary information is provided. $N$ and $V_{dc}$ are given. The constraints on the waveform $v_o(t)$ are clearly stated. The properties of the constituent cells are defined. The problem is self-contained.\n-   **Consistency**: No internal contradictions. The constraint $|v_{o}(t)| \\leq N V_{dc}$ is consistent with the fact that the inverter is made of $N$ cells, each with a maximum voltage magnitude of $V_{dc}$. Odd half-wave symmetry implies zero average value, which is also stated as a separate constraint, so they are consistent.\n-   **Realism**: The model is idealized (ideal switches), which is a common and acceptable simplification in introductory and theoretical power electronics problems. The setup is physically plausible.\n-   **Other flags**:\n    *   Factual unsoundness: None.\n    *   Non-formalizable: No, it's a standard engineering problem.\n    *   Incomplete/Contradictory: No.\n    *   Unrealistic: Ideal switches are an idealization, but not an invalidating one.

I will proceed with the full solution as planned.\n\n**Detailed Solution steps:**\n1.  **Derivation of Maximum Fundamental Peak Amplitude**\n    *   The fundamental component of $v_o(t)$ has amplitude $V_{o1,peak} = \\sqrt{a_1^2 + b_1^2}$.\n    *   $a_1 = \\frac{\\omega_0}{\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi/\\omega_0} v_o(t) \\cos(\\omega_0 t) dt$, $b_1 = \\frac{\\omega_0}{\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi/\\omega_0} v_o(t) \\sin(\\omega_0 t) dt$.\n    *   Let $\\theta = \\omega_0 t$. $a_1 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} v_o(\\theta) \\cos(\\theta) d\\theta$, $b_1 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} v_o(\\theta) \\sin(\\theta) d\\theta$.\n    *   Due to odd half-wave symmetry, $v_o(\\theta+\\pi) = -v_o(\\theta)$, the Fourier series contains only odd harmonics.\n    *   We can choose the time origin (phase) to simplify the analysis. Let's align the desired fundamental component with $\\sin(\\theta)$, so we are maximizing $b_1$ and aiming for $a_1=0$. This is achieved if $v_o(\\theta)$ is an odd function, $v_o(-\\theta) = -v_o(\\theta)$, which also implies $a_n=0$ for all $n$. A square wave centered at the origin is an odd function.\n    *   To maximize $b_1 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} v_o(\\theta) \\sin(\\theta) d\\theta$, we must choose $v_o(\\theta)$ to have the same sign as $\\sin(\\theta)$ and the largest possible magnitude.\n    *   The physical constraint is $|v_o(\\theta)| \\le N V_{dc}$.\n    *   The function $\\sin(\\theta)$ is positive for $\\theta \\in (0, \\pi)$ and negative for $\\theta \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$.\n    *   Therefore, to maximize the integral, we must select the control waveform $v_o(\\theta)$ to be:\n        $v_o(\\theta) = +N V_{dc}$ for $\\theta \\in (0, \\pi)$\n        $v_o(\\theta) = -N V_{dc}$ for $\\theta \\in (\\pi, 2\\pi)$\n    *   This is a square wave of amplitude $N V_{dc}$. This waveform is constructible, as all cells can be switched to $+V_{dc}$ or all cells to $-V_{dc}$. It also satisfies the odd half-wave symmetry condition.\n    *   Now, calculate $b_1$ for this waveform.\n        $b_1 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left[ \\int_0^{\\pi} (N V_{dc}) \\sin(\\theta) d\\theta + \\int_{\\pi}^{2\\pi} (-N V_{dc}) \\sin(\\theta) d\\theta \\right]$\n        $b_1 = \\frac{N V_{dc}}{\\pi} \\left[ [-\\cos(\\theta)]_0^{\\pi} - [-\\cos(\\theta)]_{\\pi}^{2\\pi} \\right]$\n        $b_1 = \\frac{N V_{dc}}{\\pi} \\left[ (-\\cos(\\pi) - (-\\cos(0))) - (-\\cos(2\\pi) - (-\\cos(\\pi))) \\right]$\n        $b_1 = \\frac{N V_{dc}}{\\pi} \\left[ (-(-1) - (-1)) - (-1 - (-(-1))) \\right] = \\frac{N V_{dc}}{\\pi} \\left[ (1+1) - (-1 - 1) \\right] = \\frac{N V_{dc}}{\\pi} [2 - (-2)] = \\frac{4 N V_{dc}}{\\pi}$.\n    *   The calculation with the half-period integral was faster but this confirms it.\n    *   So, the maximum peak amplitude of the fundamental is $V_{o1,peak,max} = \\frac{4}{\\pi} N V_{dc}$.\n\n2.  **Conversion to RMS**\n    *   The fundamental component is a sinusoid: $v_{o1}(t) = V_{o1, peak} \\sin(\\omega_0 t)$.\n    *   The RMS value of a sinusoid is its peak value divided by $\\sqrt{2}$.\n    *   $V_{o1,rms,max} = \\frac{V_{o1,peak,max}}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\left( \\frac{4}{\\pi} N V_{dc} \\right) = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{\\pi} N V_{dc}$.\n    *   This derivation is robust.\n\n3.  **Number of Voltage Levels**\n    *   Let $v_i$ be the voltage of the $i$-th cell, where $v_i \\in \\{-V_{dc}, 0, +V_{dc}\\}$.\n    *   The total voltage is $v_o = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} v_i$.\n    *   This sum can be written as $v_o = k \\cdot V_{dc}$, where $k$ is an integer.\n    *   The minimum value of $k$ occurs when all cells output $-V_{dc}$, so $v_o = N \\cdot (-V_{dc}) = -N V_{dc}$. So, $k_{min} = -N$.\n    *   The maximum value of $k$ occurs when all cells output $+V_{dc}$, so $v_o = N \\cdot (+V_{dc}) = +N V_{dc}$. So, $k_{max} = +N$.\n    *   Can we generate any integer value of $k$ between $-N$ and $N$?\n    *   Let's start from the state where all cells output $-V_{dc}$ ($k = -N$). Now, change one cell's output from $-V_{dc}$ to $0$. The total voltage becomes $(-N+1)V_{dc}$. Change another cell from $-V_{dc}$ to $0$. The total voltage becomes $(-N+2)V_{dc}$.

The setup is physically realizable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and complete. It is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem asks for two results: first, a general expression for the uniform carrier phase shift, $\\Delta \\phi$, for an $N$-cell CHB inverter using PS-PWM, and second, the specific phase angles for the case of $N=4$.\n\nThe fundamental principle of PS-PWM is to achieve a higher effective switching frequency at the output of the phase leg by interleaving the switching events of the individual cells. The carrier waveform for each cell has a frequency $f_s$ and a corresponding period $T_s = 1/f_s$.\n\nTo achieve an effective switching ripple frequency of $N f_s$, the waveform of the total output voltage must exhibit a periodicity corresponding to an effective period of $T_{eff} = 1/(N f_s) = T_s/N$. This is accomplished by distributing the switching patterns of the $N$ cells uniformly throughout the fundamental carrier period $T_s$.\n\nThe problem states that uniform interleaving distributes switching transitions evenly in time. With $N$ cells, this implies that the carrier waveform of each subsequent cell must be time-shifted by a uniform amount, $\\Delta t$, relative to the previous one. To cover the entire period $T_s$ with $N$ uniform shifts, the time shift between adjacent carriers must be:\n$$ \\Delta t = \\frac{T_s}{N} $$\n\nThe problem provides the relationship between a time shift $\\Delta t$ and the corresponding phase shift $\\Delta \\phi$ for a periodic signal of period $T_s$:\n$$ \\Delta \\phi = \\frac{2\\pi \\Delta t}{T_s} $$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Delta t$ into this equation yields the required uniform phase shift $\\Delta \\phi$ between the carriers of adjacent cells:\n$$ \\Delta \\phi = \\frac{2\\pi \\left(\\frac{T_s}{N}\\right)}{T_s} = \\frac{2\\pi}{N} $$\nThis phase shift ensures that the dominant carrier harmonics in the individual cell output voltages cancel out in the summed phase-leg voltage for harmonic numbers $k=1, 2, \\dots, N-1$. The first harmonic group that does not cancel is at the frequency $N f_s$, which becomes the effective switching ripple frequency of the synthesized phase voltage. This effect in the phase voltage directly translates to the line voltage, as the line voltage is a linear combination of two phase voltages.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires calculating the absolute phase angles for the four carriers in one phase leg for the case where $N=4$. We use the formula derived above for $\\Delta \\phi$.\nFor $N=4$, the uniform phase shift is:\n$$ \\Delta \\phi = \\frac{2\\pi}{4} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\text{ radians} $$\n\nWe are asked to express the angles relative to a reference carrier at an angle of $0$. Let the phase angles of the four carriers be $\\phi_1, \\phi_2, \\phi_3,$ and $\\phi_4$. We can set the phase of the first carrier to be the reference.\n\n1.  The phase angle of the first carrier is $\\phi_1 = 0$.\n2.  The phase angle of the second carrier is shifted by $\\Delta \\phi$ from the first:\n    $$ \\phi_2 = \\phi_1 + \\Delta \\phi = 0 + \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $$\n3.  The phase angle of the third carrier is shifted by $\\Delta \\phi$ from the second:\n    $$ \\phi_3 = \\phi_2 + \\Delta \\phi = \\frac{\\pi}{2} + \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\pi $$\n4.  The phase angle of the fourth carrier is shifted by $\\Delta \\phi$ from the third:\n    $$ \\phi_4 = \\phi_3 + \\Delta \\phi = \\pi + \\frac{\\pi}{2} = \\frac{3\\pi}{2} $$\n\nThe set of absolute carrier phase angles for the four cells is $\\{0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\pi, \\frac{3\\pi}{2}\\}$.

The three phase-legs (a, b, c) can each connect their output terminal to one of three voltage levels relative to the DC-bus midpoint (O): $+V_{\\text{dc}}/2$, $0$, or $-V_{\\text{dc}}/2$.

These instantaneous vectors can be categorized by their magnitude.\nLet's analyze the key vectors that form the boundary of the feasible operating region. These are the \"large vectors\". Consider the switching state $(s_a, s_b, s_c) = (1, -1, -1)$. The resulting space vector is:\n$$ \\vec{v}_s = \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}}{3} (1 - a - a^2) $$\nUsing the property $1 + a + a^2 = 0$, which implies $-a-a^2=1$, we get:\n$$ \\vec{v}_s = \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}}{3} (1 + 1) = \\frac{2V_{\\text{dc}}}{3} $$\nThis vector lies on the positive real axis. There are six such \"large vectors\" corresponding to the switching state permutations where one phase is at one extreme voltage and the other two are at the opposite extreme. Let's list their states and resulting vectors:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $(1, -1, -1) \\rightarrow \\vec{v}_s = \\frac{2V_{\\text{dc}}}{3}$\n    \\item $(1, 1, -1) \\rightarrow \\vec{v}_s = \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}}{3}(1+a-a^2) = \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}}{3}(1+a - (-1-a)) = \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}}{3}(2+2a) = \\frac{2V_{\\text{dc}}}{3}(1+a) = \\frac{2V_{\\text{dc}}}{3}(-a^2) = \\frac{2V_{\\text{dc}}}{3}\\exp(j\\pi/3)$\n    \\item $(-1, 1, -1) \\rightarrow \\vec{v}_s = \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}}{3}(-1+a-a^2) = \\frac{2V_{\\text{dc}}}{3}\\exp(j2\\pi/3)$\n    \\item $(-1, 1, 1) \\rightarrow \\vec{v}_s = \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}}{3}(-1+a+a^2) = -\\frac{2V_{\\text{dc}}}{3} = \\frac{2V_{\\text{dc}}}{3}\\exp(j\\pi)$\n    \\item $(-1, -1, 1) \\rightarrow \\vec{v}_s = \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}}{3}(-1-a+a^2) = \\frac{2V_{\\text{dc}}}{3}\\exp(j4\\pi/3)$\n    \\item $(1, -1, 1) \\rightarrow \\vec{v}_s = \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}}{3}(1-a+a^2) = \\frac{2V_{\\text{dc}}}{3}\\exp(j5\\pi/3)$\n\\end{itemize}\nThese six large vectors all have a magnitude of $\\frac{2V_{\\text{dc}}}{3}$ and are separated by angles of $\\pi/3$ ($60^\\circ$). They form the vertices of a regular hexagon centered at the origin. Other switching states produce \"medium\", \"small\", and \"zero\" vectors, all of which lie within or on the boundary of this large hexagon.\n\nThe convex polygon of feasible average space vectors is the convex hull of all possible instantaneous vectors. This region is therefore the large hexagon defined by the six large vectors. Any desired reference vector $\\vec{v}_{ref}$ inside this hexagon can be synthesized by time-averaging the three nearest instantaneous vectors.\n\nFor linear modulation, the trajectory of the reference vector must remain within the operating region at all times. The reference vector for a balanced sinusoidal output tracks a circular path. To avoid distortion (overmodulation), this circular path must be fully contained within the hexagonal boundary. The largest possible circle that fits inside the hexagon is its inscribed circle. The radius of this circle, $r_{in}$, determines the maximum magnitude of the reference vector.\n\nA regular hexagon with vertices at a distance $R_{vert}$ from the center has an inscribed circle radius (apothem) of $r_{in} = R_{vert} \\cos(\\pi/6) = R_{vert} \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.\nIn our case, the vertex distance is $R_{vert} = \\frac{2V_{\\text{dc}}}{3}$. Therefore, the radius of the largest inscribed circle is:\n$$ r_{in} = \\left(\\frac{2V_{\\text{dc}}}{3}\\right) \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}}{\\sqrt{3}} $$\nThis is the maximum magnitude of a reference voltage vector that can be synthesized without distortion. $|\\vec{v}_{ref}|_{max} = r_{in}$.\n\nNext, we must relate the magnitude of the reference space vector to the peak phase voltage, $V_{1,\\text{phase,peak}}$. The reference is a balanced set of sinusoidal phase voltages (line-to-neutral):\n$$ v_{aN,ref}(t) = V_{1,\\text{phase,peak}} \\cos(\\omega t) $$\n$$ v_{bN,ref}(t) = V_{1,\\text{phase,peak}} \\cos(\\omega t - 2\\pi/3) $$\n$$ v_{cN,ref}(t) = V_{1,\\text{phase,peak}} \\cos(\\omega t - 4\\pi/3) $$\nFor a balanced system, the sum of phase voltages is zero, so their zero-sequence component is zero. This allows us to equate the reference phase voltages $v_{kN,ref}$ with the reference pole voltages $v_{kO,ref}$. The reference space vector $\\vec{v}_{ref}(t)$ is obtained by applying the Clarke transform to these voltages:\n$$ \\vec{v}_{ref}(t) = \\frac{2}{3} (v_{aN,ref} + a v_{bN,ref} + a^2 v_{cN,ref}) $$\n$$ \\vec{v}_{ref}(t) = \\frac{2}{3} V_{1,\\text{phase,peak}} \\left[ \\cos(\\omega t) + a \\cos(\\omega t - 2\\pi/3) + a^2 \\cos(\\omega t - 4\\pi/3) \\right] $$\nUsing Euler's formula, $\\cos\\theta = (\\exp(j\\theta) + \\exp(-j\\theta))/2$, and the definition of $a = \\exp(j2\\pi/3)$, the term in the brackets can be simplified:\n$$ \\cos(\\omega t) + a \\cos(\\omega t - 2\\pi/3) + a^2 \\cos(\\omega t - 4\\pi/3) = \\frac{3}{2} \\exp(j\\omega t) $$\nSubstituting this identity back into the expression for $\\vec{v}_{ref}(t)$:\n$$ \\vec{v}_{ref}(t) = \\frac{2}{3} V_{1,\\text{phase,peak}} \\left( \\frac{3}{2} \\exp(j\\omega t) \\right) = V_{1,\\text{phase,peak}} \\exp(j\\omega t) $$\nThis shows that the reference space vector is a vector of constant magnitude $|\\vec{v}_{ref}| = V_{1,\\text{phase,peak}}$, rotating at an angular frequency $\\omega$.\n\nThe boundary of the linear modulation region is reached when the magnitude of the reference vector equals the radius of the inscribed circle:\n$$ |\\vec{v}_{ref}|_{max} = V_{1,\\text{phase,peak,max}} = r_{in} = \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}}{\\sqrt{3}} $$\nThe problem defines the modulation index as $m_a \\equiv V_{1,\\text{phase,peak}}/(V_{\\text{dc}}/2)$. The maximum modulation index, $m_{a,max}$, is thus:\n$$ m_{a,max} = \\frac{V_{1,\\text{phase,peak,max}}}{V_{\\text{dc}}/2} = \\frac{V_{\\text{dc}}/\\sqrt{3}}{V_{\\text{dc}}/2} $$\n$$ m_{a,max} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} $$",
