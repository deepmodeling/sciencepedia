            "problem": "A dual three-phase, six-pulse, fully controlled converter composed of two antiparallel bridges supplies a separately excited direct current (DC) motor through a large smoothing inductance, ensuring continuous DC current. The source is a balanced, ideal three-phase alternating current (AC) system. The dual converter operates in circulating-current-free mode so that only one bridge conducts at a time. The firing angle of the active bridge is denoted by $\\alpha$, measured from the positive-going zero crossing of the corresponding phase-to-neutral source voltage.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It presents a standard theoretical exercise in power electronics.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts. First, a derivation of the displacement power factor for an ideal converter. Second, a discussion of how non-ideal effects, specifically commutation overlap, modify the power factor.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Displacement Power Factor ($\\cos \\phi$)**\n\nThe displacement power factor is defined as $\\cos \\phi$, where $\\phi$ is the phase angle between the fundamental component of the AC line current and the corresponding AC phase voltage. We will derive this for phase 'a'.\n\n**1. AC Source Voltage**\nLet the phase 'a' to neutral voltage be a sinusoidal function of time, given by:\n$$v_{an}(\\omega t) = V_m \\sin(\\omega t)$$\nwhere $V_m$ is the peak phase voltage and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency.\n\n**2. AC Line Current Waveform**\nFor a six-pulse fully controlled bridge with a large smoothing inductor, the DC link current $I_d$ is continuous and ripple-free. The AC line current for phase 'a', denoted $i_a(t)$, is constructed from the switching action of the thyristors. A thyristor connected to a given phase conducts for $120^\\circ$ (or $\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ radians) per cycle for the positive current half-cycle and another thyristor conducts for $120^\\circ$ for the negative current half-cycle. This results in a quasi-square waveform for $i_a(t)$.\n\nThe firing angle $\\alpha$ is measured from the positive-going zero-crossing of the phase-to-neutral voltage. In a three-phase system, the natural commutation point for the thyristor in the positive group of phase 'a' (let's call it $T_1$) occurs at $\\omega t = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$ radians ($30^\\circ$) past the zero-crossing of $v_{an}$. The firing of $T_1$ is delayed by $\\alpha$ from this point. Therefore, $T_1$ starts conducting at:\n$$\\omega t_{start, T1} = \\frac{\\pi}{6} + \\alpha$$\nSince $T_1$ conducts for $\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ radians, it stops conducting at:\n$$\\omega t_{stop, T1} = \\frac{\\pi}{6} + \\alpha + \\frac{2\\pi}{3} = \\frac{5\\pi}{6} + \\alpha$$\nDuring this interval, the line current $i_a(t)$ is equal to the DC current $I_d$.\n\nThe thyristor in the negative group of phase 'a' (let's call it $T_4$) is fired $180^\\circ$ ($\\pi$ radians) after $T_1$. So, $T_4$ starts conducting at:\n$$\\omega t_{start, T4} = \\frac{\\pi}{6} + \\alpha + \\pi = \\frac{7\\pi}{6} + \\alpha$$\n$T_4$ also conducts for $\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ radians, stopping at:\n$$\\omega t_{stop, T4} = \\frac{7\\pi}{6} + \\alpha + \\frac{2\\pi}{3} = \\frac{11\\pi}{6} + \\alpha$$\nDuring this interval, the line current $i_a(t)$ is equal to $-I_d$.\n\nThe line current waveform for one cycle is thus described by:\n$$\ni_a(\\omega t) =\n\\begin{cases}\n+I_d  \\text{for } \\frac{\\pi}{6} + \\alpha \\le \\omega t \\le \\frac{5\\pi}{6} + \\alpha \\\\\n-I_d  \\text{for } \\frac{7\\pi}{6} + \\alpha \\le \\omega t \\le \\frac{11\\pi}{6} + \\alpha \\\\\n0  \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n**3. Fourier Series Analysis**\nTo find the fundamental component of $i_a(\\omega t)$, we compute the Fourier series coefficients $a_1$ and $b_1$. The fundamental component is $i_{a1}(\\omega t) = a_1 \\cos(\\omega t) + b_1 \\sin(\\omega t)$.\n$$a_1 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} i_a(\\omega t) \\cos(\\omega t) d(\\omega t)$$\n$$b_1 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_0^{2\\pi} i_a(\\omega t) \\sin(\\omega t) d(\\omega t)$$\n\nCalculating $a_1$:\n$$a_1 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left[ \\int_{\\pi/6+\\alpha}^{5\\pi/6+\\alpha} I_d \\cos(\\omega t) d(\\omega t) + \\int_{7\\pi/6+\\alpha}^{11\\pi/6+\\alpha} (-I_d) \\cos(\\omega t) d(\\omega t) \\right]$$\n$$a_1 = \\frac{I_d}{\\pi} \\left[ [\\sin(\\omega t)]_{\\pi/6+\\alpha}^{5\\pi/6+\\alpha} - [\\sin(\\omega t)]_{7\\pi/6+\\alpha}^{11\\pi/6+\\alpha} \\right]$$\n$$a_1 = \\frac{I_d}{\\pi} \\left[ (\\sin(\\frac{5\\pi}{6}+\\alpha) - \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{6}+\\alpha)) - (\\sin(\\frac{11\\pi}{6}+\\alpha) - \\sin(\\frac{7\\pi}{6}+\\alpha)) \\right]$$\nUsing the identity $\\sin A - \\sin B = 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{A+B}{2}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{A-B}{2}\\right)$:\nFor the first term: $\\sin(\\frac{5\\pi}{6}+\\alpha) - \\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{6}+\\alpha) = 2\\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+\\alpha)\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{3}) = 2(-\\sin\\alpha)(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}) = -\\sqrt{3}\\sin\\alpha$.\nFor the second term: $\\sin(\\frac{11\\pi}{6}+\\alpha) - \\sin(\\frac{7\\pi}{6}+\\alpha) = 2\\cos(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}+\\alpha)\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{3}) = 2(\\sin\\alpha)(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}) = \\sqrt{3}\\sin\\alpha$.\n$$a_1 = \\frac{I_d}{\\pi} [-\\sqrt{3}\\sin\\alpha - (\\sqrt{3}\\sin\\alpha)] = -\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}I_d}{\\pi}\\sin\\alpha$$\n\nCalculating $b_1$:\n$$b_1 = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\left[ \\int_{\\pi/6+\\alpha}^{5\\pi/6+\\alpha} I_d \\sin(\\omega t) d(\\omega t) + \\int_{7\\pi/6+\\alpha}^{11\\pi/6+\\alpha} (-I_d) \\sin(\\omega t) d(\\omega t) \\right]$$\n$$b_1 = \\frac{I_d}{\\pi} \\left[ [-\\cos(\\omega t)]_{\\pi/6+\\alpha}^{5\\pi/6+\\alpha} - [-\\cos(\\omega t)]_{7\\pi/6+\\alpha}^{11\\pi/6+\\alpha} \\right]$$\n$$b_1 = \\frac{I_d}{\\pi} \\left[ -(\\cos(\\frac{5\\pi}{6}+\\alpha) - \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{6}+\\alpha)) + (\\cos(\\frac{11\\pi}{6}+\\alpha) - \\cos(\\frac{7\\pi}{6}+\\alpha)) \\right]$$\nUsing the identity $\\cos A - \\cos B = -2\\sin\\left(\\frac{A+B}{2}\\right)\\sin\\left(\\frac{A-B}{2}\\right)$:\nFor the first term: $\\cos(\\frac{5\\pi}{6}+\\alpha) - \\cos(\\frac{\\pi}{6}+\\alpha) = -2\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{2}+\\alpha)\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{3}) = -2(\\cos\\alpha)(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}) = -\\sqrt{3}\\cos\\alpha$.\nFor the second term: $\\cos(\\frac{11\\pi}{6}+\\alpha) - \\cos(\\frac{7\\pi}{6}+\\alpha) = -2\\sin(\\frac{3\\pi}{2}+\\alpha)\\sin(\\frac{\\pi}{3}) = -2(-\\cos\\alpha)(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}) = \\sqrt{3}\\cos\\alpha$.\n$$b_1 = \\frac{I_d}{\\pi} [- (-\\sqrt{3}\\cos\\alpha) + (\\sqrt{3}\\cos\\alpha)] = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}I_d}{\\pi}\\cos\\alpha$$\n\n**4. Displacement Power Factor**\nThe fundamental component of the line current is:\n$$i_{a1}(\\omega t) = \\left(-\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}I_d}{\\pi}\\sin\\alpha\\right)\\cos(\\omega t) + \\left(\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}I_d}{\\pi}\\cos\\alpha\\right)\\sin(\\omega t)$$\n$$i_{a1}(\\omega t) = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}I_d}{\\pi} [\\cos\\alpha \\sin(\\omega t) - \\sin\\alpha \\cos(\\omega t)]$$\nUsing the angle subtraction identity for sine, $\\sin(A-B) = \\sin A \\cos B - \\cos A \\sin B$:\n$$i_{a1}(\\omega t) = \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}I_d}{\\pi} \\sin(\\omega t - \\alpha)$$\nThe phase voltage is $v_{an}(\\omega t) = V_m \\sin(\\omega t)$. The fundamental current $i_{a1}(\\omega t)$ lags the voltage by an angle $\\alpha$. Therefore, the phase displacement angle is $\\phi = \\alpha$.\nThe displacement power factor is $\\cos\\phi$.\n$$\\cos\\phi = \\cos\\alpha$$\nThis result is valid for the entire range of the firing angle $\\alpha$ of the active converter, which is $0  \\alpha  \\pi$. For rectification ($0  \\alpha  \\frac{\\pi}{2}$), $\\cos\\alpha$ is positive, indicating power flow from AC to DC. For inversion ($\\frac{\\pi}{2}  \\alpha  \\pi$), $\\cos\\alpha$ is negative, indicating power flow from DC to AC. Both modes result in a lagging displacement power factor because the current fundamental always lags the voltage. The dual converter allows for four-quadrant operation by enabling negative DC current, but the relationship between the active converter's firing angle and its displacement factor remains the same.\n\n**Part 2: Effect of Commutation Overlap ($\\mu$)**\n\nIn a real converter, the AC source always possesses some inductance $L_s$. This inductance prevents instantaneous transfer of current from one phase to another. The process of transferring current from an outgoing thyristor to an incoming thyristor is called commutation, and it takes a finite time, corresponding to a commutation overlap angle $\\mu > 0$.\n\nThe commutation overlap modifies the ideal line current waveform and, consequently, the power factor. The true power factor ($PF$) is the product of the displacement factor ($\\cos\\phi$) and the distortion factor ($g = I_{1,rms} / I_{rms}$).\n$$PF = g \\cdot \\cos\\phi$$\n\n**1. Effect on Displacement Factor**\nDuring commutation, the line current does not change instantaneously but ramps up or down. For example, the leading edge of the current pulse is no longer a vertical step but a ramp of duration $\\mu$. This effectively delays the current waveform with respect to the voltage. The phase lag $\\phi$ of the fundamental current component increases. The new phase angle $\\phi'$ is greater than $\\alpha$. It can be shown that the new displacement factor $\\cos\\phi'$ is given by:\n$$\\cos\\phi' = \\frac{\\cos\\alpha + \\cos(\\alpha+\\mu)}{2}$$\nSince $\\mu > 0$, for $\\alpha \\in (0, \\pi)$, it holds that $\\cos(\\alpha+\\mu)  \\cos\\alpha$, which implies $\\cos\\phi'  \\cos\\alpha$. Thus, the commutation overlap **degrades (reduces) the displacement power factor**.\n\n**2. Effect on Distortion Factor**\nThe ideal line current waveform is a quasi-square wave with sharp, vertical edges, which is rich in harmonics. The distortion factor $g = I_{1,rms} / I_{rms}$ (where $I_{1,rms}$ is the RMS value of the fundamental and $I_{rms}$ is the total RMS value of the current) is significantly less than unity.\nThe commutation overlap \"rounds off\" the sharp edges of the current waveform, making it more trapezoidal. A waveform with smoother transitions has less high-frequency harmonic content compared to one with abrupt changes. This means that the energy in the harmonic components is reduced relative to the fundamental. As a result, the ratio $I_{1,rms} / I_{rms}$ increases, moving closer to $1$. Therefore, the commutation overlap **improves (increases) the distortion factor**.\n\n**3. Effect on True Power Factor**\nThe true power factor is subject to two opposing effects from commutation overlap: the displacement factor decreases, while the distortion factor increases. In typical line-commutated converter applications, the negative impact of the increased phase lag on the displacement factor is more significant than the positive impact of the waveform smoothing on the distortion factor.\nConsequently, the overall effect of a non-zero commutation overlap $\\mu$ is a **reduction in the true power factor** compared to the ideal case where $\\mu=0$.",

The total instantaneous conduction power loss associated with the load current is:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{load}}(t) = N_{c} \\left( V_{T} |i(t)| + r_{T} |i(t)|^2 \\right)$$\nNote that $|i(t)|^2$ is equivalent to $i(t)^2$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the non-circulating current operation.\nIn this mode, the total energy dissipation, $E_{\\mathrm{nc}}$, is the sum of the total conduction energy loss over the profile and the changeover energy loss, $W_{x}$. The profile shows one transition from positive to negative current at $t=50~\\mathrm{s}$, which constitutes a changeover.\n$$E_{\\mathrm{nc}} = \\int_{0}^{T} p_{\\mathrm{load}}(t) \\, dt + W_{x} = N_{c} V_{T} \\int_{0}^{T} |i(t)| \\, dt + N_{c} r_{T} \\int_{0}^{T} i(t)^2 \\, dt + W_{x}$$\nTo evaluate this, we must first compute the integrals of $|i(t)|$ and $i(t)^2$ over the mission profile duration $T = 100~\\mathrm{s}$. The armature current $i(t)$ is defined piecewise:\n- For $t \\in [0, 10]~\\mathrm{s}$, $i(t) = 20t~\\mathrm{A}$.\n- For $t \\in (10, 40]~\\mathrm{s}$, $i(t) = 200~\\mathrm{A}$.\n- For $t \\in (40, 50]~\\mathrm{s}$, $i(t) = 200 - 20(t-40) = 1000 - 20t~\\mathrm{A}$.\n- For $t \\in (50, 60]~\\mathrm{s}$, $i(t) = -15(t-50) = 750 - 15t~\\mathrm{A}$.\n- For $t \\in (60, 90]~\\mathrm{s}$, $i(t) = -150~\\mathrm{A}$.\n- For $t \\in (90, 100]~\\mathrm{s}$, $i(t) = -150 + 15(t-90) = 15t - 1500~\\mathrm{A}$.\n\nLet's compute the integral of the absolute current, $A_{1} = \\int_{0}^{T} |i(t)| \\, dt$. This can be found by summing the areas under the $|i(t)|$ curve for each segment:\n$$A_{1} = \\int_{0}^{10} 20t \\, dt + \\int_{10}^{40} 200 \\, dt + \\int_{40}^{50} (1000 - 20t) \\, dt + \\int_{50}^{60} |750 - 15t| \\, dt + \\int_{60}^{90} |-150| \\, dt + \\int_{90}^{100} |15t - 1500| \\, dt$$\n$$A_{1} = [10t^2]_{0}^{10} + [200t]_{10}^{40} + [\\text{Area of triangle}] + [\\text{Area of triangle}] + [150t]_{60}^{90} + [\\text{Area of triangle}]$$\n$$A_{1} = 1000 + 200(30) + \\frac{1}{2}(10)(200) + \\frac{1}{2}(10)(150) + 150(30) + \\frac{1}{2}(10)(150)$$\n$$A_{1} = 1000 + 6000 + 1000 + 750 + 4500 + 750 = 14000~\\mathrm{A \\cdot s}$$\n\nNext, we compute the integral of the squared current, $A_{2} = \\int_{0}^{T} i(t)^2 \\, dt$:\n$$A_{2} = \\int_{0}^{10} (20t)^2 dt + \\int_{10}^{40} (200)^2 dt + \\int_{40}^{50} (1000 - 20t)^2 dt + \\int_{50}^{60} (750 - 15t)^2 dt + \\int_{60}^{90} (-150)^2 dt + \\int_{90}^{100} (15t - 1500)^2 dt$$\n$$ \\int (at+b)^2 dt = \\frac{(at+b)^3}{3a} $$\n$$A_{2} = \\left[\\frac{400t^3}{3}\\right]_{0}^{10} + [40000t]_{10}^{40} + \\left[\\frac{(1000-20t)^3}{3(-20)}\\right]_{40}^{50} + \\left[\\frac{(750-15t)^3}{3(-15)}\\right]_{50}^{60} + [22500t]_{60}^{90} + \\left[\\frac{(15t-1500)^3}{3(15)}\\right]_{90}^{100}$$\n$$A_{2} = \\frac{400000}{3} + 40000(30) - \\frac{1}{60}[0^3 - 200^3] - \\frac{1}{45}[(-150)^3 - 0^3] + 22500(30) + \\frac{1}{45}[0^3 - (-150)^3]$$\n$$A_{2} = \\frac{400000}{3} + 1200000 + \\frac{8000000}{60} + \\frac{3375000}{45} + 675000 + \\frac{3375000}{45}$$\n$$A_{2} = \\frac{400000}{3} + 1200000 + \\frac{400000}{3} + 75000 + 675000 + 75000 = \\frac{800000}{3} + 1200000 + 825000$$\n$$A_{2} = \\frac{800000}{3} + 2025000 = \\frac{800000 + 6075000}{3} = \\frac{6875000}{3}~\\mathrm{A^2 \\cdot s}$$\nNow, we calculate $E_{\\mathrm{nc}}$ using the given parameters: $V_{T} = 1.7~\\mathrm{V}$, $r_{T} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-3}~\\Omega$, $N_{c} = 2$, and $W_{x} = 400~\\mathrm{J}$.\n$$E_{\\mathrm{nc}} = 2 \\left( (1.7) (14000) + (1.5 \\times 10^{-3}) \\left(\\frac{6875000}{3}\\right) \\right) + 400$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{nc}} = 2 \\left( 23800 + (0.5 \\times 10^{-3}) (6875000) \\right) + 400$$\n$$E_{\\mathrm{nc}} = 2 \\left( 23800 + 3437.5 \\right) + 400 = 2(27237.5) + 400 = 54475 + 400 = 54875~\\mathrm{J}$$\n\nNext, we analyze the circulating current operation.\nIn this mode, there is an additional source of continuous power loss due to the circulating current $I_c$. There is no changeover loss $W_x$. The total energy dissipation, $E_{\\mathrm{circ}}$, is the sum of the energy dissipated by the load current and the energy dissipated by the circulating current.\n$$E_{\\mathrm{circ}} = \\int_{0}^{T} p_{\\mathrm{load}}(t) \\, dt + \\int_{0}^{T} p_{\\mathrm{circ\\_const}} \\, dt$$\nThe first term is the conduction energy due to load current, which we have already calculated as $54475~\\mathrm{J}$.\nThe second term is the energy from the constant power loss due to the circulating current $I_c = 20~\\mathrm{A}$. This current flows through a path consisting of $N_{\\mathrm{ic}} = 4$ SCRs and a limiting reactor with resistance $R_{L} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-2}~\\Omega$. The constant power loss is:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{circ\\_const}} = N_{\\mathrm{ic}} \\left( V_{T} I_{c} + r_{T} I_{c}^2 \\right) + R_{L} I_{c}^2 = N_{\\mathrm{ic}} V_{T} I_{c} + (N_{\\mathrm{ic}} r_{T} + R_{L}) I_{c}^2$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{circ\\_const}} = 4(1.7)(20) + (4(1.5 \\times 10^{-3}) + 2.0 \\times 10^{-2}) (20)^2$$\n$$P_{\\mathrm{circ\\_const}} = 136 + (6 \\times 10^{-3} + 20 \\times 10^{-3}) (400)$$\n$$P_{\\mathrm{circ\\_const}} = 136 + (26 \\times 10^{-3}) (400) = 136 + 10.4 = 146.4~\\mathrm{W}$$\nThe energy dissipated by the circulating current over the total duration $T=100~\\mathrm{s}$ is:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{circ\\_add}} = P_{\\mathrm{circ\\_const}} \\times T = 146.4~\\mathrm{W} \\times 100~\\mathrm{s} = 14640~\\mathrm{J}$$\nThe total energy dissipation in circulating current mode is:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{circ}} = 54475~\\mathrm{J} + 14640~\\mathrm{J} = 69115~\\mathrm{J}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the relative energy savings $S$:\n$$S = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{circ}} - E_{\\mathrm{nc}}}{E_{\\mathrm{circ}}} = \\frac{69115 - 54875}{69115} = \\frac{14240}{69115}$$\n$$S \\approx 0.2060334...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $S = 0.2060$.",
