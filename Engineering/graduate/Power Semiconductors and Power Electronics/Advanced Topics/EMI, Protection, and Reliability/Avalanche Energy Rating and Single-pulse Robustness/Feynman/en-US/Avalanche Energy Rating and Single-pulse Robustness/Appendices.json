The problem states that the contribution from the power supply is negligible, so the loop contains only these two components.\n$$v_L(t) + v_{DS}(t) = 0$$\nwhere $v_L(t)$ is the voltage across the inductor. Substituting $v_{DS}(t) = V_{\\text{BR(DSS)}}$, we get:\n$$v_L(t) = -V_{\\text{BR(DSS)}}$$\nThe constitutive relation for an inductor is:\n$$v_L(t) = L \\frac{di_L(t)}{dt}$$\nEquating the two expressions for $v_L(t)$:\n$$L \\frac{di_L(t)}{dt} = -V_{\\text{BR(DSS)}}$$\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation for the inductor current $i_L(t)$.

            "solution": "The problem is evaluated to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It describes a standard Unclamped Inductive Switching (UIS) test for a power MOSFET and requests a derivation and calculation based on fundamental principles of circuit theory. I will proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe solution is divided into two parts as requested. First, we derive the expression for the required avalanche current $I_{AS}$ and calculate its value. Second, we analyze the effect of inductor tolerance on the actual avalanche energy and compute the worst-case deviation.\n\nPart 1: Derivation and calculation of the avalanche current $I_{AS}$.\n\nThe Unclamped Inductive Switching (UIS) test circuit consists of a DC voltage supply $V_s$, an inductor $L$, and the MOSFET under test. When the MOSFET is turned off, the inductor current, which has ramped up to a peak value $I_{AS}$, is forced to flow through the MOSFET, driving it into avalanche breakdown. The drain-source voltage clamps at the breakdown voltage $V_{BR}$.\n\nThe circuit loop during the avalanche phase consists of the DC supply $V_s$, the inductor $L$, and the MOSFET. Let $i(t)$ be the current flowing through the inductor and the MOSFET, and let the avalanche phase begin at $t=0$, so $i(0) = I_{AS}$. The voltage at the positive terminal of the supply is $V_s$ with respect to ground, and the MOSFET's source is at ground. During avalanche, the MOSFET drain-source voltage is constant at $V_{BR}$. The voltage across the inductor, $v_L(t)$, is the difference between the voltage at its terminals. One terminal is at $V_s$ and the other is at the MOSFET's drain, which is at $V_{BR}$. Thus, $v_L(t) = V_s - V_{BR}$.\n\nAccording to the inductor's constitutive law, $v_L(t) = L \\frac{\\mathrm{d}i}{\\mathrm{d}t}$. Combining these, we get the differential equation for the current during avalanche:\n$$L \\frac{\\mathrm{d}i}{\\mathrm{d}t} = V_s - V_{BR}$$\nSince $V_{BR} > V_s$, the term on the right is negative, correctly indicating that the current is decreasing. We can solve for $i(t)$ by direct integration from $t=0$ to a later time $t$:\n$$ \\int_{I_{AS}}^{i(t)} \\mathrm{d}i' = \\int_0^t \\frac{V_s - V_{BR}}{L} \\mathrm{d}t' $$\n$$ i(t) - I_{AS} = \\frac{V_s - V_{BR}}{L} t $$\n$$ i(t) = I_{AS} + \\left(\\frac{V_s - V_{BR}}{L}\\right)t $$\nThe avalanche phase ends when the current decays to zero. Let this duration be $t_{av}$. We find $t_{av}$ by setting $i(t_{av})=0$:\n$$ 0 = I_{AS} + \\left(\\frac{V_s - V_{BR}}{L}\\right)t_{av} $$\n$$ t_{av} = -I_{AS} \\frac{L}{V_s - V_{BR}} = I_{AS} \\frac{L}{V_{BR} - V_s} $$\nThe total energy absorbed by the MOSFET during avalanche, $E_{AS}$, is the time integral of the instantaneous power, $p(t) = v(t)i(t)$. During avalanche, the voltage across the device is constant, $v(t) = V_{BR}$.\n$$ E_{AS} = \\int_0^{t_{av}} p(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t = \\int_0^{t_{av}} V_{BR} i(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t $$\nSubstituting the expression for $i(t)$:\n$$ E_{AS} = V_{BR} \\int_0^{t_{av}} \\left( I_{AS} + \\frac{V_s - V_{BR}}{L}t \\right) \\mathrm{d}t $$\n$$ E_{AS} = V_{BR} \\left[ I_{AS}t + \\frac{V_s - V_{BR}}{2L}t^2 \\right]_0^{t_{av}} = V_{BR} \\left( I_{AS}t_{av} + \\frac{V_s - V_{BR}}{2L}t_{av}^2 \\right) $$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $t_{av}$:\n$$ E_{AS} = V_{BR} \\left( I_{AS}\\left(\\frac{I_{AS}L}{V_{BR} - V_s}\\right) + \\frac{V_s - V_{BR}}{2L}\\left(\\frac{I_{AS}L}{V_{BR} - V_s}\\right)^2 \\right) $$\n$$ E_{AS} = V_{BR} \\left( \\frac{L I_{AS}^2}{V_{BR} - V_s} + \\frac{V_s - V_{BR}}{2L} \\frac{L^2 I_{AS}^2}{(V_{BR} - V_s)^2} \\right) $$\n$$ E_{AS} = V_{BR} \\left( \\frac{L I_{AS}^2}{V_{BR} - V_s} - \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{L I_{AS}^2}{V_{BR} - V_s} \\right) = V_{BR} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{L I_{AS}^2}{V_{BR} - V_s} \\right) $$\nThis yields the expression for the avalanche energy:\n$$ E_{AS} = \\frac{1}{2} L I_{AS}^2 \\left( \\frac{V_{BR}}{V_{BR} - V_s} \\right) $$\nTo find the required current $I_{AS}$ for a specified energy $E_{AS}$ using a nominal inductance $L_{\\mathrm{nom}}$, we rearrange this formula:\n$$ I_{AS}^2 = \\frac{2 E_{AS}}{L_{\\mathrm{nom}}} \\left( \\frac{V_{BR} - V_s}{V_{BR}} \\right) = \\frac{2 E_{AS}}{L_{\\mathrm{nom}}} \\left( 1 - \\frac{V_s}{V_{BR}} \\right) $$\n$$ I_{AS} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 E_{AS}}{L_{\\mathrm{nom}}} \\left( 1 - \\frac{V_s}{V_{BR}} \\right)} $$\nUsing the given numerical values: $E_{AS}=0.240\\,\\text{J}$, $L_{\\mathrm{nom}}=1.5\\,\\text{mH} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{H}$, $V_{BR}=600\\,\\text{V}$, and $V_{s}=48\\,\\text{V}$.\n$$ I_{AS} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 0.240}{1.5 \\times 10^{-3}} \\left( 1 - \\frac{48}{600} \\right)} $$\n$$ I_{AS} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.48}{1.5 \\times 10^{-3}} \\left( 1 - 0.08 \\right)} = \\sqrt{320 \\times 0.92} = \\sqrt{294.4} $$\n$$ I_{AS} \\approx 17.158088\\,\\text{A} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the required avalanche current is $17.16\\,\\text{A}$.\n\nPart 2: Analysis of inductor tolerance and worst-case energy deviation.\n\nThe peak current $I_{AS}$ is achieved by turning the MOSFET on for a specific duration $t_{\\mathrm{on}}$. During this time, the inductor current ramps up approximately as $\\mathrm{d}i/\\mathrm{d}t = V_s/L$. The on-time $t_{\\mathrm{on}}$ is calculated using the nominal inductance $L_{\\mathrm{nom}}$ to achieve the target current $I_{AS}$:\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{on}} = \\frac{I_{AS} L_{\\mathrm{nom}}}{V_s} $$\nThis on-time is fixed in the test setup. However, the actual inductance $L$ has a tolerance, given by $L = L_{\\mathrm{nom}}(1+\\delta)$, where $\\delta \\in [-0.15, +0.15]$. The actual peak current, $I_{\\mathrm{act}}$, reached with the actual inductance $L$ and fixed on-time $t_{\\mathrm{on}}$ is:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{act}} = \\frac{V_s}{L} t_{\\mathrm{on}} = \\frac{V_s}{L_{\\mathrm{nom}}(1+\\delta)} \\left( \\frac{I_{AS} L_{\\mathrm{nom}}}{V_s} \\right) = \\frac{I_{AS}}{1+\\delta} $$\nThe actual avalanche energy dissipated, $E_{\\mathrm{act}}$, will depend on this actual current $I_{\\mathrm{act}}$ and the actual inductance $L$. Using the energy formula derived previously:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{act}} = \\frac{1}{2} L I_{\\mathrm{act}}^2 \\left( \\frac{V_{BR}}{V_{BR} - V_s} \\right) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $L$ and $I_{\\mathrm{act}}$ in terms of $\\delta$:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{act}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ L_{\\mathrm{nom}}(1+\\delta) \\right] \\left[ \\frac{I_{AS}}{1+\\delta} \\right]^2 \\left( \\frac{V_{BR}}{V_{BR} - V_s} \\right) $$\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{act}} = \\frac{1}{2} L_{\\mathrm{nom}}(1+\\delta) \\frac{I_{AS}^2}{(1+\\delta)^2} \\left( \\frac{V_{BR}}{V_{BR} - V_s} \\right) = \\frac{1}{1+\\delta} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} L_{\\mathrm{nom}} I_{AS}^2 \\left( \\frac{V_{BR}}{V_{BR} - V_s} \\right) \\right] $$\nThe term in the square brackets is the definition of the target energy $E_{AS}$. Therefore, the relationship between the actual energy and the tolerance parameter $\\delta$ is:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{act}} = \\frac{E_{AS}}{1+\\delta} $$\nThe fractional deviation from the target energy is $\\left|E_{\\mathrm{act}}/E_{AS} - 1\\right|$.\n$$ \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{act}}}{E_{AS}} = \\frac{1}{1+\\delta} $$\n$$ \\text{Fractional Deviation} = \\left| \\frac{1}{1+\\delta} - 1 \\right| = \\left| \\frac{1 - (1+\\delta)}{1+\\delta} \\right| = \\left| \\frac{-\\delta}{1+\\delta} \\right| = \\frac{|\\delta|}{|1+\\delta|} $$\nWe need to find the worst-case (maximum) value of this deviation for $\\delta \\in [-0.15, +0.15]$. In this interval, $1+\\delta$ is always positive (it ranges from $0.85$ to $1.15$), so $|1+\\delta| = 1+\\delta$. The function to maximize is $f(\\delta) = \\frac{|\\delta|}{1+\\delta}$. We check the endpoints of the interval:\nFor $\\delta = +0.15$:\n$$ f(0.15) = \\frac{0.15}{1+0.15} = \\frac{0.15}{1.15} \\approx 0.130435 $$\nFor $\\delta = -0.15$:\n$$ f(-0.15) = \\frac{|-0.15|}{1+(-0.15)} = \\frac{0.15}{0.85} \\approx 0.176471 $$\nComparing the two values, the maximum deviation occurs at $\\delta = -0.15$.\n$$ \\text{Worst-case Fractional Deviation} = \\frac{0.15}{0.85} = \\frac{15}{85} = \\frac{3}{17} \\approx 0.176470588... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the worst-case fractional deviation is $0.1765$.",

The rising $v_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ plateau primarily indicates hot-carrier charging of the gate oxide, increasing the threshold voltage and forcing $v_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ upward; the subsequent snapback reflects discharge of the gate oxide and is the dominant secondary breakdown mechanism in UIS for MOSFETs.\n\nC.

My task is to validate the problem statement, and if it is valid, to provide a detailed solution based on first principles and evaluate the given options.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n\n-   **Device:** High-voltage silicon power MOSFET.\n-   **Test:** Standard Unclamped Inductive Switching (UIS) single-pulse test.\n-   **Circuit Setup:**\n    -   Inductor: $L=1.0\\,\\mathrm{mH}$.\n    -   Initial inductor current: $I_0=8.0\\,\\mathrm{A}$.\n    -   Gate-source voltage during avalanche: $V_{\\mathrm{GS}}=0\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n    -   A low-impedance drain supply is disconnected at turn-off.\n-   **Initial Conditions:** Ambient temperature $T_{\\mathrm{A}}=25\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$.\n-   **Observed Waveform Features ($v_{\\mathrm{DS}}(t)$, $i_{\\mathrm{D}}(t)$):**\n    -   During avalanche, $v_{\\mathrm{DS}}(t)$ clamps initially at $\\approx 520\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n    -   $v_{\\mathrm{DS}}(t)$ plateau rises slowly, reaching $\\approx 560\\,\\mathrm{V}$ by $t\\approx 15\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$.\n    -   Small-amplitude micro-oscillations ride on the $v_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ plateau.\n    -   $i_{\\mathrm{D}}(t)$ decays approximately linearly until $t\\approx 15\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$.\n    -   At $t\\approx 16\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$, a sudden voltage snapback occurs: $v_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ drops to $\\approx 240\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n    -   Simultaneously, a current surge occurs: $i_{\\mathrm{D}}$ surges to $\\approx 10\\,\\mathrm{A}$.\n-   **Provided Physical Laws and Facts:**\n    -   The breakdown voltage of silicon has a positive temperature coefficient: $\\Delta B\\!V/B\\!V \\approx k_{\\mathrm{BV}}\\Delta T$, with $k_{\\mathrm{BV}}\\sim 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.\n    -   Inductor voltage: $v_{L}(t)=L\\,\\mathrm{d}i_D/\\mathrm{d}t$.\n    -   Joule power: $p(t)=v_{\\mathrm{DS}}(t)i_{\\mathrm{D}}(t)$.\n    -   Deposited energy: $E(t)=\\int_{0}^{t}v_{\\mathrm{DS}}(\\tau)i_{\\mathrm{D}}(\\tau)\\,\\mathrm{d}\\tau$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n\n1.  **Scientific Grounding:** The problem is firmly grounded in the established physics of semiconductor devices and power electronics. The UIS test is a standard method for evaluating MOSFET ruggedness. The concepts of avalanche breakdown, its positive temperature coefficient in silicon, parasitic BJT activation, and secondary breakdown are all fundamental to the field. The provided value for $k_{\\mathrm{BV}}$ is empirically correct. The described waveform is a textbook example of a MOSFET failing under UIS stress.\n2.  **Well-Posedness:** The problem provides sufficient quantitative and qualitative information to perform the requested estimations and interpretations. The questions posed guide the analysis towards known physical mechanisms. A unique and stable interpretation based on these standard mechanisms exists.\n3.  **Objectivity:** The problem statement is expressed in precise, objective technical language, free from subjective or ambiguous descriptions.\n4.  **Consistency and Realism:** The data are self-consistent and realistic. The initial energy stored in the inductor is $E_L = \\frac{1}{2}LI_0^2 = \\frac{1}{2}(1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{H})(8.0\\,\\mathrm{A})^2 = 32\\,\\mathrm{mJ}$. During avalanche, the inductor voltage is approximately $-v_{\\mathrm{DS}}$. The current decay rate is $\\mathrm{d}i_D/\\mathrm{d}t = -v_{\\mathrm{DS}}/L$. Using an average $v_{\\mathrm{DS}} \\approx 540\\,\\mathrm{V}$, the time to discharge the inductor from $8\\,\\mathrm{A}$ to $0\\,\\mathrm{A}$ would be $t_{av} = \\Delta i_D / (\\mathrm{d}i_D/\\mathrm{d}t) = I_0 / (v_{\\mathrm{DS}}/L) = LI_0/v_{\\mathrm{DS}} = (1.0 \\times 10^{-3} \\cdot 8.0) / 540 \\approx 14.8\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$. This calculated duration is in excellent agreement with the observation of linear decay \"until $t\\approx 15\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$\". The problem data are internally consistent and physically plausible.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem describes a sequence of events during a UIS test: (1) stable avalanche phase, (2) onset of failure. I will first analyze these phases based on the provided data and physical principles before evaluating each option.\n\n**Analysis of the Stable Avalanche Phase ($t=0$ to $t \\approx 15\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$)**\n\nDuring this phase, the MOSFET is in avalanche breakdown. The energy stored in the inductor, $E_L = \\frac{1}{2}LI_0^2 = 32\\,\\mathrm{mJ}$, is dissipated as heat in the device. The device acts as a voltage clamp, so the drain-source voltage is the breakdown voltage, $v_{\\mathrm{DS}}(t) = B\\!V_{\\mathrm{DSS}}(t)$. The inductor current $i_{\\mathrm{D}}(t)$ ramps down as governed by $L\\,\\mathrm{d}i_{\\mathrm{D}}/\\mathrm{d}t = -v_{\\mathrm{DS}}(t)$.\n\n1.  **Rising $v_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ Plateau and Temperature Rise:** The observation that $v_{\\mathrm{DS}}(t)$ rises from $\\approx 520\\,\\mathrm{V}$ to $\\approx 560\\,\\mathrm{V}$ is a direct consequence of the positive temperature coefficient of the avalanche breakdown voltage in silicon. As the device dissipates power, its junction temperature $T_J$ rises. The problem gives the relation $\\Delta B\\!V/B\\!V \\approx k_{\\mathrm{BV}}\\Delta T$. We can estimate the temperature rise at $t \\approx 15\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$.\n    The change in breakdown voltage is $\\Delta B\\!V = 560\\,\\mathrm{V} - 520\\,\\mathrm{V} = 40\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n    Using the initial breakdown voltage as the reference $B\\!V \\approx 520\\,\\mathrm{V}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{BV}} \\sim 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$:\n    $$ \\Delta T \\approx \\frac{\\Delta B\\!V}{B\\!V \\cdot k_{\\mathrm{BV}}} = \\frac{40\\,\\mathrm{V}}{520\\,\\mathrm{V} \\cdot 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}} = \\frac{40}{0.52}\\,\\mathrm{K} \\approx 76.9\\,\\mathrm{K} $$\n    This significant temperature rise confirms that the device is under substantial thermal stress. The rising voltage indicates that the device is absorbing energy and heating up, which is a necessary precursor to thermally-induced failure mechanisms.\n\n**Analysis of the Failure Event ($t \\approx 16\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$)**\n\n1.  **Voltage Snapback and Current Surge:** The abrupt transition from a high-voltage, moderate-current state ($v_{\\mathrm{DS}} \\approx 560\\,\\mathrm{V}$, $i_{\\mathrm{D}} \\to 0\\,\\mathrm{A}$) to a low-voltage, high-current state ($v_{\\mathrm{DS}} \\approx 240\\,\\mathrm{V}$, $i_{\\mathrm{D}} \\approx 10\\,\\mathrm{A}$) is the defining characteristic of secondary breakdown in a power MOSFET. This phenomenon signals a change in the dominant conduction mechanism.\n2.  **Parasitic BJT Activation:** The physical mechanism is the activation of the parasitic NPN bipolar transistor (BJT) inherent in the vertical DMOS structure. The components of this BJT are: Emitter (N+ source), Base (P-body), and Collector (N-drift region and N+ drain). During avalanche, impact ionization in the drain-body junction generates electron-hole pairs. The electrons are swept to the drain, and the holes flow through the P-body to the source contact. This hole current creates a voltage drop across the resistance of the P-body ($R_B$). When this voltage drop becomes large enough ($\\approx 0.7\\,\\mathrm{V}$) to forward-bias the body-source (base-emitter) junction, the parasitic BJT turns on.\n3.  **Electrothermal Feedback and Instability:** The BJT turn-on is an electrothermal instability. High temperature (as evidenced by the rising $v_{\\mathrm{DS}}$) lowers the base-emitter turn-on voltage and increases the base resistance $R_B$, making BJT turn-on more likely. Once the BJT turns on, it enters a positive feedback loop: increased current leads to more localized heating, which further enhances BJT conduction. This leads to current constricting into a narrow filament (current filamentation). The BJT provides a much more efficient conduction path than avalanche, so the sustaining voltage drops significantly (snapback). The voltage drops to the open-base BJT sustaining voltage, $BV_{\\text{CEO}}$, which is much lower than the avalanche voltage $BV_{\\text{DSS}}$ (which is analogous to $BV_{\\text{CBO}}$). The high conductivity in the filament, aided by conductivity modulation from the high level of injected carriers, allows for a surge in current.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The rising $v_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ plateau during avalanche is consistent with a positive temperature coefficient of silicon impact-ionization breakdown; local self-heating reduces impact ionization coefficients, requiring a higher electric field to sustain avalanche, so $B\\!V_{\\mathrm{DSS}}$ increases with temperature. This is a failure precursor because it indicates growing power density and electrothermal feedback that can promote localization.**\n\nThis statement is entirely correct.\n-   It correctly links the rising $v_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ to self-heating via the positive temperature coefficient of $B\\!V$.\n-   The physical reasoning provided is sound: higher temperature increases phonon scattering, carriers lose more energy to the lattice, and thus require a higher electric field (and hence voltage) to gain sufficient kinetic energy for impact ionization. This is equivalent to saying the impact ionization coefficients are reduced at higher temperatures.\n-   It correctly identifies this as a failure precursor. The heating itself is the stress that can trigger a secondary, unstable failure mechanism. While the positive temperature coefficient has a stabilizing effect by promoting current uniformity, the overall temperature rise is the key condition that enables failure.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The rising $v_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ plateau primarily indicates hot-carrier charging of the gate oxide, increasing the threshold voltage and forcing $v_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ upward; the subsequent snapback reflects discharge of the gate oxide and is the dominant secondary breakdown mechanism in UIS for MOSFETs.**\n\nThis statement is incorrect.\n-   While hot carrier injection is a real effect, it is not the primary cause of the large observed voltage shift ($\\Delta V = 40\\,\\mathrm{V}$) in a high-voltage power MOSFET under avalanche. The thermal effect described in option A provides a much better quantitative explanation.\n-   The explanation for the snapback as \"discharge of the gate oxide\" is factually wrong. As analyzed above, the snapback is due to the activation of the parasitic BJT, which is the well-established mechanism for secondary breakdown in this operational regime.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The abrupt snapback of $v_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ accompanied by a current surge is consistent with triggering of the parasitic bipolar transistor (source–body–drain path) and current filamentation; secondary breakdown in this context is an electrothermal instability exhibiting negative differential resistance and conductivity modulation.**\n\nThis statement provides a complete and accurate description of the physics of secondary breakdown.\n-   It correctly identifies the triggering of the parasitic BJT.\n-   It correctly links this to current filamentation, which is the spatial manifestation of the instability.\n-   It correctly characterizes the phenomenon as an electrothermal instability.\n-   It correctly notes the key macroscopic signatures: negative differential resistance (manifested as voltage snapback) and conductivity modulation (which contributes to the low sustaining voltage and high current capability).\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Because $i_{\\mathrm{D}}(t)$ decays, the instantaneous power $p(t)=v_{\\mathrm{DS}}(t)i_{\\mathrm{D}}(t)$ must also monotonically decay; therefore a rising $v_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ plateau cannot be due to heating, and the waveform shows no failure risk until the snapback itself.**\n\nThis statement is logically flawed and physically incorrect.\n-   The premise that instantaneous power $p(t)$ must decay is not guaranteed in general, but it is likely true in this specific case because the percentage decrease in current is much larger than the percentage increase in voltage over the interval. The initial power is $p(0) \\approx 520\\,\\mathrm{V} \\times 8\\,\\mathrm{A} = 4160\\,\\mathrm{W}$, while the power near the end of the pulse is $p(15\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}) \\approx 560\\,\\mathrm{V} \\times \\epsilon \\approx 0\\,\\mathrm{W}$, where $\\epsilon$ is a small current. The power has clearly decreased over the interval.\n-   The conclusion \"therefore a rising $v_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ plateau cannot be due to heating\" is a non-sequitur. Even if the instantaneous power is decreasing, the device is still absorbing energy. The total energy deposited, $E(t) = \\int p(\\tau)d\\tau$, is monotonically increasing. This deposited energy raises the device's temperature due to its thermal capacitance. A decreasing power input simply means the *rate* of temperature rise is slowing, not that the temperature stops rising or that heating isn't occurring.\n-   The final conclusion that there is \"no failure risk until the snapback itself\" is dangerously incorrect. The rising temperature, which causes the rising $v_{\\mathrm{DS}}$, *is* the primary indicator of failure risk. The snapback is the culmination of this risk, not its beginning.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The micro-oscillations riding on the plateau are solely parasitic inductance–capacitance ringing unrelated to semiconductor physics; they have no diagnostic value and can be ignored when assessing avalanche robustness.**\n\nThis statement is an oversimplification and likely incorrect.\n-   While parasitic $L$-$C$ elements in the circuit and device package certainly contribute to oscillations, it is not the only possible source.\n-   Avalanche breakdown can be spatially non-uniform and temporally unstable, proceeding via the dynamics of a collection of \"microplasmas\". The turning on and off of these localized breakdown sites can produce noise and oscillations on the terminal voltage and current.\n-   Therefore, the character of these oscillations can indeed have diagnostic value related to the uniformity and stability of the avalanche process within the silicon die. Stating they are \"solely\" parasitic and have \"no diagnostic value\" is an overly strong and generally false claim in the context of device failure analysis.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
