This is because a higher $THD_I$ implies a larger RMS current for the same amount of real power delivered, which by definition lowers the power factor $P/S$.\n- **Magnitude**: The magnitude of approximately $0.265$ quantifies this rate of decrease. At this operating point, a small increase in $THD_I$ of, for example, $0.01$, would lead to a decrease in the true power factor of approximately $0.265 \\times 0.01 = 0.00265$. This value indicates that the power factor is moderately sensitive to changes in current distortion.\n\nThe final answer requested is the computed numerical value of the true power factor.",

The core concepts used—real power ($P$), reactive power ($Q$), apparent power ($S$), power factor ($PF$), displacement factor ($DPF$), and distortion factor ($DF$)—are standard. The relationship $PF = DPF \\times DF$ for non-sinusoidal currents is correct. The given values are physically plausible.

I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution will be developed by following these logical steps:\n1.  Calculate the total real power $P$ drawn by the load.\n2.  Characterize the initial condition of the system before compensation, specifically calculating the fundamental reactive power $Q_{rectifier,1}$ drawn by the rectifier.\n3.  Determine the target condition after compensation, calculating the new required displacement factor $DPF_{new}$ and the corresponding total fundamental reactive power $Q_{new,1}$ to be supplied by the source.\n4.  Calculate the reactive power $Q_C$ that must be supplied by the capacitor bank.\n5.  From $Q_C$, determine the required per-phase capacitance $C$.\n\n**1. Real Power Calculation**\nAssuming no losses in the rectifier, the AC input real power $P$ is equal to the DC output power $P_{\\mathrm{dc}}$.\n$$P = P_{\\mathrm{dc}} = V_{\\mathrm{dc}} I_{\\mathrm{dc}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P = (540\\,\\mathrm{V}) \\times (50\\,\\mathrm{A}) = 27000\\,\\mathrm{W}$$\nThis is the total three-phase real power and remains constant as the DC load is unchanged.\n\n**2. Initial State Analysis (Before Compensation)**\nThe total power factor $PF$ is the product of the displacement factor $DPF$ and the distortion factor $DF$. The displacement factor is the cosine of the angle $\\phi_1$ between the fundamental components of the phase voltage and line current.\n$$DPF = \\cos(\\phi_1)$$\n$$PF = DPF \\times DF$$\nInitially, the displacement angle is given as $\\phi_0 = 15^\\circ$. The real power $P$ and the fundamental reactive power drawn by the rectifier, $Q_{rectifier,1}$, are related through this angle.\n$$Q_{rectifier,1} = P \\tan(\\phi_0)$$\nThis reactive power is inductive because the current is specified as lagging.\n$$Q_{rectifier,1} = 27000 \\tan(15^\\circ)\\,\\mathrm{VAr}$$\nThe non-linear rectifier is the source of this reactive power demand and current distortion. The addition of a shunt capacitor does not alter the behavior of the rectifier itself, so $Q_{rectifier,1}$ is a fixed quantity that needs to be compensated.\n\n**3. Target State Analysis (After Compensation)**\nThe goal is to achieve a minimum overall power factor of $PF_{new} = 0.95$. The problem states that the distortion factor $DF = 0.96$ can be considered constant. We can find the required new displacement factor, $DPF_{new}$, for the compensated system.\n$$PF_{new} = DPF_{new} \\times DF$$\n$$DPF_{new} = \\frac{PF_{new}}{DF} = \\frac{0.95}{0.96}$$\nThe new displacement angle, $\\phi_{new}$, is the arccosine of this value.\n$$\\phi_{new} = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{0.95}{0.96}\\right)$$\nSince we are adding capacitance to compensate for an initially lagging current, the minimum compensation will result in a new, smaller lagging angle. The new total fundamental reactive power, $Q_{new,1}$, supplied by the source will be:\n$$Q_{new,1} = P \\tan(\\phi_{new})$$\nWe can express $\\tan(\\phi_{new})$ in terms of $\\cos(\\phi_{new})$ using the identity $\\tan(\\arccos(x)) = \\frac{\\sqrt{1-x^2}}{x}$.\n$$Q_{new,1} = P \\frac{\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{PF_{new}}{DF}\\right)^2}}{\\frac{PF_{new}}{DF}} = P \\frac{\\sqrt{DF^2 - PF_{new}^2}}{PF_{new}}$$\n\n**4. Required Capacitor Reactive Power**\nThe shunt capacitor bank must supply the difference between the reactive power demanded by the rectifier and the final reactive power drawn from the source. The reactive power supplied by the capacitor, $Q_C$, is therefore:\n$$Q_C = Q_{rectifier,1} - Q_{new,1}$$\n$$Q_C = P \\tan(\\phi_0) - P \\frac{\\sqrt{DF^2 - PF_{new}^2}}{PF_{new}}$$\n$$Q_C = P \\left( \\tan(\\phi_0) - \\frac{\\sqrt{DF^2 - PF_{new}^2}}{PF_{new}} \\right)$$\n\n**5. Capacitance Calculation**\nThe reactive power supplied by a balanced, wye-connected three-phase capacitor bank is given by:\n$$Q_C = 3 \\omega C V_{\\mathrm{ph,rms}}^2$$\nwhere $\\omega = 2\\pi f$ is the angular frequency, $C$ is the per-phase capacitance, and $V_{\\mathrm{ph,rms}}$ is the phase RMS voltage. The phase voltage is related to the line-to-line voltage $V_{\\mathrm{LL}}$ by $V_{\\mathrm{ph,rms}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{LL}}}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $Q_C$:\n$$Q_C = 3 (2\\pi f) C \\left(\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{LL}}}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^2 = 3 (2\\pi f) C \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{LL}}^2}{3} = 2\\pi f C V_{\\mathrm{LL}}^2$$\nNow, we solve for the capacitance $C$:\n$$C = \\frac{Q_C}{2\\pi f V_{\\mathrm{LL}}^2}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $Q_C$:\n$$C = \\frac{P}{2\\pi f V_{\\mathrm{LL}}^2} \\left( \\tan(\\phi_0) - \\frac{\\sqrt{DF^2 - PF_{new}^2}}{PF_{new}} \\right)$$\nNow we substitute the numerical values into this expression.\nGiven:\n$P = 27000\\,\\mathrm{W}$\n$f = 50\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$\n$V_{\\mathrm{LL}} = 400\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n$\\phi_0 = 15^\\circ$\n$DF = 0.96$\n$PF_{new} = 0.95$\n\nFirst, calculate the terms in the parenthesis:\n$\\tan(\\phi_0) = \\tan(15^\\circ) \\approx 0.267949$\n$\\sqrt{DF^2 - PF_{new}^2} = \\sqrt{(0.96)^2 - (0.95)^2} = \\sqrt{0.9216 - 0.9025} = \\sqrt{0.0191} \\approx 0.138203$\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{DF^2 - PF_{new}^2}}{PF_{new}} = \\frac{0.138203}{0.95} \\approx 0.145477$\nThe expression in the parenthesis is:\n$0.267949 - 0.145477 = 0.122472$\n\nNext, calculate the pre-factor:\n$\\frac{P}{2\\pi f V_{\\mathrm{LL}}^2} = \\frac{27000}{2\\pi (50) (400)^2} = \\frac{27000}{100\\pi (160000)} = \\frac{27000}{1.6 \\times 10^7 \\pi} \\approx 5.371 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{F/VAr}$\n\nFinally, calculate the capacitance $C$:\n$C \\approx (5.371 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times (0.122472) \\approx 6.576 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{F}$\n\nThe problem requires the answer in microfarads ($\\mathrm{\\mu F}$), rounded to three significant figures.\n$C = 6.576 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{F} = 65.76\\,\\mathrm{\\mu F}$\nRounding to three significant figures gives $65.8\\,\\mathrm{\\mu F}$.",
