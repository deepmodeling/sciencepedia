The goal is explicitly defined.\n-   **Objective**: The language is technical and precise, free from any subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or infeasibility.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action ###\nThe problem is **valid**. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n## Solution ##\n\nThe problem requires the decomposition of the measured line-to-ground ($v_L$) and neutral-to-ground ($v_N$) noise voltages into their common-mode ($v_{CM}$) and differential-mode ($v_{DM}$) components.\n\n### 1. Definition and Derivation of CM and DM Components ###\n\nAs specified, we start from the first principles for a two-conductor system relative to a ground reference. Let $v_L$ and $v_N$ be the phasor representations of the sinusoidal voltages at the measurement frequency. The decomposition into a common-mode component $v_{CM}$ and a per-conductor differential-mode component $v_{DM}$ must satisfy the stated conditions of symmetry and charge conservation. These conditions are formulated as:\n1. The common-mode component, $v_{CM}$, is identical for both the line and neutral conductors.\n2. The differential-mode component has equal magnitude and opposite sign for the two conductors, represented as $+v_{DM}$ on the line and $-v_{DM}$ on the neutral.\n\nThis leads to the following system of linear equations for the phasors:\n$$v_{L} = v_{CM} + v_{DM} \\quad (1)$$\n$$v_{N} = v_{CM} - v_{DM} \\quad (2)$$\n\nTo find the expressions for $v_{CM}$ and $v_{DM}$ in terms of $v_L$ and $v_N$, we solve this system of equations.\n\nAdding equation $(1)$ and $(2)$:\n$$v_{L} + v_{N} = (v_{CM} + v_{DM}) + (v_{CM} - v_{DM}) = 2v_{CM}$$\nSolving for $v_{CM}$:\n$$v_{CM} = \\frac{v_{L} + v_{N}}{2}$$\nThis shows that the common-mode voltage is the average of the line and neutral voltages.\n\nSubtracting equation $(2)$ from equation $(1)$:\n$$v_{L} - v_{N} = (v_{CM} + v_{DM}) - (v_{CM} - v_{DM}) = 2v_{DM}$$\nSolving for $v_{DM}$:\n$$v_{DM} = \\frac{v_{L} - v_{N}}{2}$$\nThis is the per-conductor differential-mode voltage, which is half the voltage difference between the line and neutral conductors.\n\n### 2. Calculation of Component Magnitudes ###\n\nThe given voltage values are in decibel-microvolts ($\\text{dB}\\mu\\text{V}$). The formula for conversion from a linear voltage magnitude $|V|$ (in $\\mu\\text{V}$) to a level in $\\text{dB}\\mu\\text{V}$ is given as $V_{\\text{dB}\\mu\\text{V}} = 20\\log_{10}(|V| / 1~\\mu\\text{V})$. To perform the phasor arithmetic, we must first convert the given decibel values back to linear voltage magnitudes.\n\nThe inverse relationship is:\n$$|V| = (1~\\mu\\text{V}) \\times 10^{\\frac{V_{\\text{dB}\\mu\\text{V}}}{20}}$$\n\nThe given values are $V_L = 62~\\text{dB}\\mu\\text{V}$ and $V_N = 58~\\text{dB}\\mu\\text{V}$. Let's find the linear magnitudes $|v_L|$ and $|v_N|$:\n$$|v_L| = 10^{\\frac{62}{20}}~\\mu\\text{V} = 10^{3.1}~\\mu\\text{V}$$\n$$|v_N| = 10^{\\frac{58}{20}}~\\mu\\text{V} = 10^{2.9}~\\mu\\text{V}$$\n\nThe problem states that the measured phase difference between the two phasors is $0^{\\circ}$. This means the phasors $v_L$ and $v_N$ are in phase. We can therefore perform addition and subtraction directly on their magnitudes. Let's align their phase with the real axis for simplicity, so $v_L = |v_L|$ and $v_N = |v_N|$.\n\nNow we calculate the magnitudes of the common-mode and differential-mode components:\n$$|v_{CM}| = \\left|\\frac{v_{L} + v_{N}}{2}\\right| = \\frac{|v_L| + |v_N|}{2} = \\frac{10^{3.1} + 10^{2.9}}{2}~\\mu\\text{V}$$\n$$|v_{DM}| = \\left|\\frac{v_{L} - v_{N}}{2}\\right| = \\frac{|v_L| - |v_N|}{2} = \\frac{10^{3.1} - 10^{2.9}}{2}~\\mu\\text{V}$$\n\nLet's compute the numerical values for the linear magnitudes:\n$$|v_L| \\approx 1258.925~\\mu\\text{V}$$\n$$|v_N| \\approx 794.328~\\mu\\text{V}$$\n\n$$|v_{CM}| \\approx \\frac{1258.925 + 794.328}{2}~\\mu\\text{V} = \\frac{2053.253}{2}~\\mu\\text{V} = 1026.627~\\mu\\text{V}$$\n$$|v_{DM}| \\approx \\frac{1258.925 - 794.328}{2}~\\mu\\text{V} = \\frac{464.597}{2}~\\mu\\text{V} = 232.299~\\mu\\text{V}$$\n\n### 3. Conversion back to dBµV ###\n\nFinally, we convert these linear magnitudes back to $\\text{dB}\\mu\\text{V}$ and round to four significant figures as requested.\n\nThe common-mode voltage magnitude in $\\text{dB}\\mu\\text{V}$, denoted $V_{\\text{CM}}$, is:\n$$V_{\\text{CM}} = 20\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{|v_{CM}|}{1~\\mu\\text{V}}\\right) = 20\\log_{10}(1026.627)$$\n$$V_{\\text{CM}} \\approx 20 \\times 3.011418 \\approx 60.22836~\\text{dB}\\mu\\text{V}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $V_{\\text{CM}} = 60.23~\\text{dB}\\mu\\text{V}$.\n\nThe per-conductor differential-mode voltage magnitude in $\\text{dB}\\mu\\text{V}$, denoted $V_{\\text{DM}}$, is:\n$$V_{\\text{DM}} = 20\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{|v_{DM}|}{1~\\mu\\text{V}}\\right) = 20\\log_{10}(232.299)$$\n$$V_{\\text{DM}} \\approx 20 \\times 2.366045 \\approx 47.3209~\\text{dB}\\mu\\text{V}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $V_{\\text{DM}} = 47.32~\\text{dB}\\mu\\text{V}$.\n\nThe final answer is required as the pair $(V_{\\text{DM}}, V_{\\text{CM}})$.\nThus, the pair of values is $(47.32~\\text{dB}\\mu\\text{V}, 60.23~\\text{dB}\\mu\\text{V})$.",

It is not a trivial calculation without understanding these underlying concepts.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. I will proceed with the detailed derivation.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires a two-part solution: first, finding the required filter attenuation in decibels, and second, determining the corresponding magnitude of the forward transmission scattering parameter, $|S_{21}|$.\n\n**Part 1: Minimum Stopband Attenuation**\n\nThe voltage level in decibel-microvolts ($\\mathrm{dB}\\mu\\mathrm{V}$) is defined with respect to a reference voltage of $V_{ref} = 1 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{V}$. The relationship is given by:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{dB}\\mu\\mathrm{V}} = 20 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{V}{1 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{V}} \\right) $$\nwhere $V$ is the root-mean-square (RMS) voltage.\n\nA filter's attenuation, $A$, represents the reduction in signal level. In a decibel scale, this reduction is achieved by subtraction. The required minimum attenuation, $A_{min}$, at the frequency $f_0$ is the difference between the initial measured noise level, $V_{initial}$, and the regulatory limit, $V_{limit}$. This will bring the noise level down to exactly the limit.\n$$ A_{min} = V_{initial} - V_{limit} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ A_{min} = 70 \\ \\mathrm{dB}\\mu\\mathrm{V} - 56 \\ \\mathrm{dB}\\mu\\mathrm{V} = 14 \\ \\mathrm{dB} $$\nThus, the filter must provide a minimum attenuation of $14 \\ \\mathrm{dB}$ at the frequency $f_0$.\n\n**Part 2: Forward Transmission Coefficient Magnitude $|S_{21}(f_0)|$**\n\nThe problem states that the filter is a linear time-invariant two-port network characterized in a $Z_0 = 50 \\ \\Omega$ system, and it is being used in a measurement setup with the same impedance ($50 \\ \\Omega$ LISN and $50 \\ \\Omega$ receiver). This constitutes a \"matched\" system, where the source impedance, load impedance, and the reference impedance for the S-parameters are all equal to $Z_0$.\n\nIn a matched two-port system, the insertion loss ($IL$), which is a measure of the attenuation introduced by the network, is directly related to the forward transmission coefficient, $S_{21}$. The term \"stopband attenuation\" in this context is equivalent to insertion loss. The magnitude squared of $S_{21}$, or $|S_{21}|^2$, represents the transducer power gain, which is the ratio of the power delivered to the load ($P_L$) to the power available from the source ($P_{AVS}$).\n$$ |S_{21}|^2 = \\frac{P_L}{P_{AVS}} $$\nThe insertion loss in decibels is defined as the ratio of the power delivered to the load without the filter ($P_{L,no\\_filter}$) to the power delivered with the filter ($P_{L,with\\_filter}$). In a matched system, $P_{L,no\\_filter} = P_{AVS}$. Therefore:\n$$ IL_{\\mathrm{dB}} = 10 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{P_{L,no\\_filter}}{P_{L,with\\_filter}} \\right) = 10 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{P_{AVS}}{P_L} \\right) = 10 \\log_{10} \\left( \\frac{1}{|S_{21}|^2} \\right) $$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, this simplifies to:\n$$ IL_{\\mathrm{dB}} = -10 \\log_{10} (|S_{21}|^2) = -20 \\log_{10} |S_{21}| $$\nThe required minimum attenuation $A_{min}$ is the required insertion loss. We can therefore write:\n$$ A_{min} = -20 \\log_{10} |S_{21}(f_0)| $$\nWe found that $A_{min} = 14 \\ \\mathrm{dB}$. Substituting this value into the equation:\n$$ 14 = -20 \\log_{10} |S_{21}(f_0)| $$\nTo find the magnitude of the S-parameter, we solve for $|S_{21}(f_0)|$:\n$$ \\log_{10} |S_{21}(f_0)| = -\\frac{14}{20} = -0.7 $$\n$$ |S_{21}(f_0)| = 10^{-0.7} $$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$ |S_{21}(f_0)| \\approx 0.1995262315 $$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ |S_{21}(f_0)| \\approx 0.1995 $$\nThis value represents the required voltage transmission ratio of the filter in the matched $50 \\ \\Omega$ system to meet the EMI limit exactly.\nThe two required values are the attenuation of $14 \\ \\mathrm{dB}$ and the S-parameter magnitude of $0.1995$.",
