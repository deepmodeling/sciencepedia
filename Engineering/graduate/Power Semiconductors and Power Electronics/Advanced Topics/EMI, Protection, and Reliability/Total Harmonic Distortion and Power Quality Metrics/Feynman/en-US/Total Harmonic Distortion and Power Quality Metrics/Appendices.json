A solution will be furnished.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nWe begin from the definitions of the quantities in the time domain. Let the instantaneous voltage be $v(t)$ and the instantaneous current be $i(t)$. Since the voltage source is ideal and sinusoidal, its waveform contains only the fundamental frequency. We can write it as:\n$$v(t) = \\sqrt{2} V_1 \\cos(\\omega t)$$\nwhere $V_1$ is the RMS value of the voltage, and we have arbitrarily set its phase angle to $0$.\n\nThe load current is non-sinusoidal and can be represented by a Fourier series:\n$$i(t) = \\sum_{h=1}^{\\infty} i_h(t) = \\sum_{h=1}^{\\infty} \\sqrt{2} I_h \\cos(h\\omega t - \\phi_h)$$\nwhere $I_h$ is the RMS value of the $h$-th harmonic component of the current and $\\phi_h$ is its phase angle relative to the fundamental voltage's phase. The problem gives the displacement angle $\\phi = 30^\\circ$, which is the phase difference for the fundamental components, so $\\phi_1 = 30^\\circ$.\n\n**1. Active Power ($P$)**\nThe active power $P$ is the time-average of the instantaneous power $p(t) = v(t)i(t)$ over one fundamental period $T = 2\\pi/\\omega$.\n$$P = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_0^T v(t) i(t) \\,dt$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $v(t)$ and $i(t)$:\n$$P = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_0^T \\left( \\sqrt{2} V_1 \\cos(\\omega t) \\right) \\left( \\sum_{h=1}^{\\infty} \\sqrt{2} I_h \\cos(h\\omega t - \\phi_h) \\right) \\,dt$$\n$$P = \\frac{2 V_1}{T} \\sum_{h=1}^{\\infty} I_h \\int_0^T \\cos(\\omega t) \\cos(h\\omega t - \\phi_h) \\,dt$$\nDue to the orthogonality of sinusoids, the integral is non-zero only when the frequencies are equal, i.e., for the harmonic order $h=1$.\n$$ \\int_0^T \\cos(\\omega t) \\cos(h\\omega t - \\phi_h) \\,dt = 0 \\quad \\text{for } h \\neq 1 $$\nTherefore, only the fundamental component contributes to the active power.\n$$P = \\frac{2 V_1 I_1}{T} \\int_0^T \\cos(\\omega t) \\cos(\\omega t - \\phi_1) \\,dt$$\nUsing the product-to-sum identity $\\cos(A)\\cos(B) = \\frac{1}{2}[\\cos(A-B) + \\cos(A+B)]$:\n$$P = \\frac{2 V_1 I_1}{T} \\int_0^T \\frac{1}{2}[\\cos(\\phi_1) + \\cos(2\\omega t - \\phi_1)] \\,dt$$\nThe integral of $\\cos(2\\omega t - \\phi_1)$ over one period is zero.\n$$P = \\frac{V_1 I_1}{T} \\int_0^T \\cos(\\phi_1) \\,dt = \\frac{V_1 I_1 \\cos(\\phi_1)}{T} [t]_0^T = V_1 I_1 \\cos(\\phi_1)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$P = (230\\ \\mathrm{V})(10\\ \\mathrm{A}) \\cos(30^\\circ) = 2300 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 1150\\sqrt{3}\\ \\mathrm{W}$$\n$$P \\approx 1991.858\\ \\mathrm{W}$$\nExpressed in kilowatts and rounded to four significant figures, $P = 1.992\\ \\mathrm{kW}$.\n\n**2. Reactive Power ($Q$)**\nAccording to the IEEE standard definition, in the presence of harmonics, the total reactive power is the sum of the reactive powers at each harmonic frequency:\n$$Q = \\sum_{h=1}^{\\infty} Q_h = \\sum_{h=1}^{\\infty} V_h I_h \\sin(\\theta_{vh} - \\theta_{ih})$$\nHere, $\\theta_{vh}$ and $\\theta_{ih}$ are the phase angles of the $h$-th voltage and current harmonics. The phase difference is $\\phi_h = \\theta_{vh} - \\theta_{ih}$. Since the voltage is purely sinusoidal, $V_h = 0$ for all $h > 1$. Thus, only the fundamental component contributes to the reactive power.\n$$Q = V_1 I_1 \\sin(\\phi_1)$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$Q = (230\\ \\mathrm{V})(10\\ \\mathrm{A}) \\sin(30^\\circ) = 2300 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 1150\\ \\mathrm{VAr}$$\nExpressed in kilovolt-amperes reactive and rounded to four significant figures, $Q = 1.150\\ \\mathrm{kVAr}$.\n\n**3. Apparent Power ($S$)**\nApparent power $S$ is defined as the product of the total RMS voltage $V_{\\text{rms}}$ and the total RMS current $I_{\\text{rms}}$.\n$$S = V_{\\text{rms}} I_{\\text{rms}}$$\nThe total RMS voltage is simply $V_1$ since no voltage harmonics are present:\n$$V_{\\text{rms}} = \\sqrt{\\sum_{h=1}^{\\infty} V_h^2} = \\sqrt{V_1^2 + 0^2 + \\dots} = V_1 = 230\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\nThe total RMS current is the square root of the sum of the squares of the RMS values of all its harmonic components:\n$$I_{\\text{rms}} = \\sqrt{\\sum_{h=1}^{\\infty} I_h^2} = \\sqrt{I_1^2 + I_2^2 + I_3^2 + \\dots}$$\nThe Total Harmonic Distortion of the current, $\\mathrm{THD}_I$, is defined as the ratio of the RMS value of the harmonic components to the RMS value of the fundamental component. Let $I_H$ be the RMS value of all harmonic currents (for $h \\ge 2$):\n$$I_H = \\sqrt{\\sum_{h=2}^{\\infty} I_h^2}$$\nThen, the definition of $\\mathrm{THD}_I$ is:\n$$\\mathrm{THD}_I = \\frac{I_H}{I_1}$$\nWe can express $I_{\\text{rms}}$ in terms of $I_1$ and $\\mathrm{THD}_I$:\n$$I_{\\text{rms}}^2 = I_1^2 + \\sum_{h=2}^{\\infty} I_h^2 = I_1^2 + I_H^2 = I_1^2 + (I_1 \\cdot \\mathrm{THD}_I)^2 = I_1^2 (1 + \\mathrm{THD}_I^2)$$\n$$I_{\\text{rms}} = I_1 \\sqrt{1 + \\mathrm{THD}_I^2}$$\nSubstituting the given values for $I_1$ and $\\mathrm{THD}_I$:\n$$I_{\\text{rms}} = (10\\ \\mathrm{A}) \\sqrt{1 + (0.4)^2} = 10 \\sqrt{1.16}\\ \\mathrm{A} \\approx 10.77033\\ \\mathrm{A}$$\nNow, we can compute the apparent power $S$:\n$$S = V_1 I_{\\text{rms}} = (230\\ \\mathrm{V}) \\times (10 \\sqrt{1.16}\\ \\mathrm{A}) = 2300 \\sqrt{1.16}\\ \\mathrm{VA}$$\n$$S \\approx 2477.1758\\ \\mathrm{VA}$$\nExpressed in kilovolt-amperes and rounded to four significant figures, $S = 2.477\\ \\mathrm{kVA}$.\n\n**4. Distortion Power ($D$)**\nThe relationship between apparent power $S$, active power $P$, reactive power $Q$, and distortion power $D$ is given by the power tetrahedron concept:\n$$S^2 = P^2 + Q^2 + D^2$$\nThis allows us to solve for the distortion power $D$:\n$$D = \\sqrt{S^2 - P^2 - Q^2}$$\nWe can also recognize that the fundamental apparent power $S_1$ is related to $P$ and $Q$ by $S_1^2 = P_1^2 + Q_1^2$. Since voltage is sinusoidal, $P=P_1$ and $Q=Q_1$, so $S_1^2 = P^2 + Q^2 = (V_1 I_1)^2 (\\cos^2\\phi_1 + \\sin^2\\phi_1) = (V_1 I_1)^2$.\nLet's substitute the derived expressions for $S$, $P$, and $Q$:\n$$D^2 = S^2 - (P^2 + Q^2) = (V_{\\text{rms}} I_{\\text{rms}})^2 - (V_1 I_1 \\cos\\phi_1)^2 - (V_1 I_1 \\sin\\phi_1)^2$$\n$$D^2 = (V_1 I_{\\text{rms}})^2 - (V_1 I_1)^2 (\\cos^2\\phi_1 + \\sin^2\\phi_1)$$\n$$D^2 = V_1^2 I_{\\text{rms}}^2 - V_1^2 I_1^2 = V_1^2 (I_{\\text{rms}}^2 - I_1^2)$$\nFrom the derivation for $I_{\\text{rms}}$, we have $I_{\\text{rms}}^2 = I_1^2 + I_H^2$. Thus, $I_{\\text{rms}}^2 - I_1^2 = I_H^2$.\n$$D^2 = V_1^2 I_H^2 \\implies D = V_1 I_H$$\nUsing $I_H = I_1 \\cdot \\mathrm{THD}_I$:\n$$D = V_1 (I_1 \\cdot \\mathrm{THD}_I)$$\nThis expression shows that distortion power arises from the interaction of the fundamental voltage with the harmonic currents.\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$D = (230\\ \\mathrm{V}) \\times (10\\ \\mathrm{A} \\times 0.4) = 230 \\times 4 = 920\\ \\mathrm{VAd}$$\nExpressed in kilovolt-amperes distortion and rounded to four significant figures, $D = 0.9200\\ \\mathrm{kVAd}$.\n\n**Summary of Results:**\n- Active Power, $P = 1.992\\ \\mathrm{kW}$\n- Reactive Power, $Q = 1.150\\ \\mathrm{kVAr}$\n- Apparent Power, $S = 2.477\\ \\mathrm{kVA}$\n- Distortion Power, $D = 0.9200\\ \\mathrm{kVAd}$\n\nThese values will be presented in the final answer as a matrix in the requested order.",

Therefore, only the term where $h=1$ contributes to the average power.\n$$P = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_0^T \\left( \\sqrt{2} V_1 \\cos(\\omega t) \\right) \\left( \\sqrt{2} I_1 \\cos(\\omega t - \\phi) \\right) dt$$\n$$P = \\frac{2V_1 I_1}{T} \\int_0^T \\cos(\\omega t) \\cos(\\omega t - \\phi) dt$$\nUsing the trigonometric identity $\\cos(A)\\cos(B) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\cos(A-B) + \\cos(A+B))$, we get:\n$$P = V_1 I_1 \\left( \\frac{1}{T} \\int_0^T [\\cos(\\phi) + \\cos(2\\omega t - \\phi)] dt \\right)$$\nThe integral of the $\\cos(2\\omega t - \\phi)$ term over one period $T$ is zero.\n$$P = V_1 I_1 \\cos(\\phi) \\left( \\frac{1}{T} \\int_0^T dt \\right) = V_1 I_1 \\cos(\\phi)$$\n\n**Apparent Power ($S$)**\nApparent power is the product of the total RMS voltage $V_{\\text{rms}}$ and the total RMS current $I_{\\text{rms}}$.\n$$S = V_{\\text{rms}} I_{\\text{rms}}$$\nSince the voltage is purely sinusoidal, its RMS value is simply the RMS value of the fundamental: $V_{\\text{rms}} = V_1$.\nThe RMS value of the nonsinusoidal current is the square root of the sum of the squares of the RMS values of its harmonic components:\n$$I_{\\text{rms}} = \\sqrt{\\sum_{h=1}^{\\infty} I_h^2} = \\sqrt{I_1^2 + I_2^2 + I_3^2 + \\dots} = \\sqrt{I_1^2 + \\sum_{h=2}^{\\infty} I_h^2}$$\nWe are given the definition of the Total Harmonic Distortion of current:\n$$THD_I = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\sum_{h=2}^{\\infty} I_h^2}}{I_1}$$\nFrom this, we can express the sum of the squares of the harmonic currents:\n$$\\sum_{h=2}^{\\infty} I_h^2 = (I_1 \\cdot THD_I)^2 = I_1^2 (THD_I)^2$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $I_{\\text{rms}}$:\n$$I_{\\text{rms}} = \\sqrt{I_1^2 + I_1^2 (THD_I)^2} = \\sqrt{I_1^2 (1 + (THD_I)^2)} = I_1 \\sqrt{1 + (THD_I)^2}$$\nNow, we can write the expression for apparent power:\n$$S = V_1 \\left( I_1 \\sqrt{1 + (THD_I)^2} \\right)$$\n\n**True Power Factor ($PF$) Expression**\nWe can now assemble the expression for the true power factor:\n$$PF = \\frac{P}{S} = \\frac{V_1 I_1 \\cos(\\phi)}{V_1 I_1 \\sqrt{1 + (THD_I)^2}}$$\nCanceling the $V_1$ and $I_1$ terms, we arrive at the desired expression:\n$$PF = \\frac{\\cos(\\phi)}{\\sqrt{1 + (THD_I)^2}}$$\nThis expression shows that the true power factor is the product of the displacement power factor, $\\cos(\\phi)$, and a distortion factor, $1/\\sqrt{1 + (THD_I)^2}$, which accounts for the harmonic distortion in the current.\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\nWe are given $THD_I = 0.35$ and a displacement power factor $\\cos(\\phi) = 0.9$.\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$PF = \\frac{0.9}{\\sqrt{1 + (0.35)^2}} = \\frac{0.9}{\\sqrt{1 + 0.1225}} = \\frac{0.9}{\\sqrt{1.1225}}$$\n$$PF \\approx \\frac{0.9}{1.05948096} \\approx 0.84947029$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the true power factor is $0.8495$.\n\n**Sensitivity Analysis**\nTo assess the local sensitivity of the true power factor to $THD_I$, we compute the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial(PF)}{\\partial(THD_I)}$.\n$$PF(THD_I, \\cos\\phi) = \\cos(\\phi) \\cdot (1 + (THD_I)^2)^{-1/2}$$\nUsing the chain rule for differentiation:\n$$\\frac{\\partial(PF)}{\\partial(THD_I)} = \\cos(\\phi) \\left[ -\\frac{1}{2} (1 + (THD_I)^2)^{-3/2} \\cdot (2 \\cdot THD_I) \\right]$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial(PF)}{\\partial(THD_I)} = - \\frac{THD_I \\cdot \\cos(\\phi)}{(1 + (THD_I)^2)^{3/2}}$$\nNow, we evaluate this derivative at the operating point $THD_I = 0.35$ and $\\cos(\\phi) = 0.9$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial(PF)}{\\partial(THD_I)}\\bigg|_{0.35, 0.9} = - \\frac{0.35 \\cdot 0.9}{(1 + (0.35)^2)^{3/2}} = - \\frac{0.315}{(1.1225)^{3/2}}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial(PF)}{\\partial(THD_I)}\\bigg|_{0.35, 0.9} \\approx - \\frac{0.315}{1.18928} \\approx -0.26487$$\nThe physical meaning of this sensitivity is as follows:\n- **Sign**: The negative sign indicates that the true power factor decreases as the total harmonic distortion of the current increases. This is because a higher $THD_I$ implies a larger RMS current for the same amount of real power delivered, which by definition lowers the power factor $P/S$.\n- **Magnitude**: The magnitude of approximately $0.265$ quantifies this rate of decrease. At this operating point, a small increase in $THD_I$ of, for example, $0.01$, would lead to a decrease in the true power factor of approximately $0.265 \\times 0.01 = 0.00265$. This value indicates that the power factor is moderately sensitive to changes in current distortion.\n\nThe final answer requested is the computed numerical value of the true power factor.",
