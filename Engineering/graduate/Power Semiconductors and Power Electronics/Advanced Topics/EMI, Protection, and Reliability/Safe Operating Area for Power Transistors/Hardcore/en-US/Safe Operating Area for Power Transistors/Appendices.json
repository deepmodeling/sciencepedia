A complete, reasoned solution follows.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe problem states that the analysis should start from the fundamental thermal conduction analogy. In this analogy, power dissipation ($P$) corresponds to current, temperature difference ($\\Delta T$) corresponds to voltage, and thermal impedance ($Z_{\\theta}$) corresponds to electrical impedance. The relationship is analogous to Ohm's Law:\n$$ \\Delta T = P \\cdot Z_{\\theta} $$\nThe problem defines the transient thermal impedance from junction to case, $Z_{\\theta \\mathrm{JC}}(t)$, as the junction temperature rise per unit constant power for a rectangular power pulse of duration $t$. Let $P$ be the magnitude of this constant power pulse. The temperature of the junction at time $t$ during the pulse, $T_j(t)$, relative to the constant case temperature $T_c$, is given by:\n$$ T_j(t) - T_c = P \\cdot Z_{\\theta \\mathrm{JC}}(t) $$\nThe constraint is that the junction temperature must not exceed the maximum allowable value, $T_{j,\\max}$. For a pulse of duration $t_p$, the most restrictive point is at the end of the pulse, $t = t_p$. Therefore, the condition is:\n$$ T_j(t_p) \\le T_{j,\\max} $$\nTo find the maximum allowable power, $P_{\\max}$, we set the junction temperature at the end of the pulse equal to its maximum limit:\n$$ T_j(t_p) = T_{j,\\max} $$\nSubstituting this into the thermal equation gives:\n$$ T_{j,\\max} - T_c = P_{\\max} \\cdot Z_{\\theta \\mathrm{JC}}(t_p) $$\nSolving for $P_{\\max}$, we obtain the general expression for the maximum constant pulse power:\n$$ P_{\\max} = \\frac{T_{j,\\max} - T_c}{Z_{\\theta \\mathrm{JC}}(t_p)} $$\nThis is the derived expression requested by the problem.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression for the two given scenarios. The pulse duration is $t_p = 1\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. The constants are $T_{j,\\max} = 175\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$ and $Z_{\\theta \\mathrm{JC}}(1\\,\\mathrm{ms}) = 0.2\\,\\mathrm{K/W}$. Note that a temperature difference has the same numerical value whether expressed in degrees Celsius or Kelvin ($\\Delta T \\text{ in K} = \\Delta T \\text{ in }^\\circ\\text{C}$), so the units are consistent.\n\n**Scenario 1: $T_c = 85\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$**\nLet $P_{\\max,1}$ be the maximum power for this case temperature.\n$$ P_{\\max,1} = \\frac{175\\,^\\circ\\text{C} - 85\\,^\\circ\\text{C}}{0.2\\,\\mathrm{K/W}} = \\frac{90\\,\\mathrm{K}}{0.2\\,\\mathrm{K/W}} = 450\\,\\mathrm{W} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $P_{\\max,1} = 450.0\\,\\mathrm{W}$.\n\n**Scenario 2: $T_c = 25\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$**\nLet $P_{\\max,2}$ be the maximum power for this case temperature.\n$$ P_{\\max,2} = \\frac{175\\,^\\circ\\text{C} - 25\\,^\\circ\\text{C}}{0.2\\,\\mathrm{K/W}} = \\frac{150\\,\\mathrm{K}}{0.2\\,\\mathrm{K/W}} = 750\\,\\mathrm{W} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $P_{\\max,2} = 750.0\\,\\mathrm{W}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the dimensionless derating ratio $r$ and the fractional reduction $f$.\n\nThe ratio $r$ is:\n$$ r = \\frac{P_{\\max,1}}{P_{\\max,2}} = \\frac{450\\,\\mathrm{W}}{750\\,\\mathrm{W}} = 0.6 $$\nExpressing this with four significant figures gives $r = 0.6000$.\n\nThe fractional reduction $f$ is:\n$$ f = 1 - r = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4 $$\nExpressing this with four significant figures gives $f = 0.4000$.\n\nThe requested quantities are the maximum pulse power at $T_c = 85\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$, the maximum pulse power at $T_c = 25\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$, the ratio $r$, and the fractional reduction $f$.\nThe values are $450.0\\,\\mathrm{W}$, $750.0\\,\\mathrm{W}$, $0.6000$, and $0.4000$, respectively.",

The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe SOA is defined by the intersection of three primary limits: the voltage limit, the current limit, and the thermal (power) limit.\n\n1.  **Voltage Limit:** The drain-source voltage must not exceed the maximum rating of the device. This gives the first constraint:\n    $$V_{DS} \\le V_{DS,\\max}$$\n    Using the given value, this is $V_{DS} \\le 100\\,\\text{V}$. This defines a vertical line at $V_{DS} = 100\\,\\text{V}$ in the $(V_{DS}, I_D)$ plane.\n\n2.  **Current Limit:** The drain current must not exceed the maximum continuous or pulsed current rating. This gives the second constraint:\n    $$I_D \\le I_{D,\\max}$$\n    Using the given value, this is $I_D \\le 60\\,\\text{A}$. This defines a horizontal line at $I_D = 60\\,\\text{A}$.\n\n3.  **Thermal Limit (Transient Power Limit):** For a single pulse, the power dissipation is limited by the maximum allowable junction temperature rise. The junction temperature $T_j$ is related to the case temperature $T_c$, the power dissipation $P_D$, and the transient thermal impedance $Z_{\\theta JC}(t)$ by the standard lumped thermal model:\n    $$T_j = T_c + P_D \\cdot Z_{\\theta JC}(t)$$\n    The power dissipated in the MOSFET when operating in the linear region is $P_D = V_{DS} \\cdot I_D$. To prevent thermal damage, the junction temperature must not exceed its maximum rating:\n    $$T_j \\le T_{j,\\max}$$\n    Substituting the expressions for $T_j$ and $P_D$, we get the thermal constraint:\n    $$T_c + (V_{DS} \\cdot I_D) \\cdot Z_{\\theta JC}(t) \\le T_{j,\\max}$$\n    Rearranging this inequality, we find the limit on power dissipation for the given pulse duration $t = 10\\,\\text{ms}$:\n    $$V_{DS} \\cdot I_D \\le \\frac{T_{j,\\max} - T_c}{Z_{\\theta JC}(t)}$$\n    Let's calculate this maximum transient power, which we will denote as $P_{transient,\\max}$:\n    $$P_{transient,\\max} = \\frac{150\\,^\\circ\\text{C} - 50\\,^\\circ\\text{C}}{0.4\\,\\text{K/W}} = \\frac{100\\,\\text{K}}{0.4\\,\\text{K/W}} = 250\\,\\text{W}$$\n    Note that a temperature difference in Kelvin ($\\text{K}$) is numerically equal to a difference in degrees Celsius ($^\\circ\\text{C}$). The thermal limit is therefore defined by the hyperbolic curve:\n    $$V_{DS} \\cdot I_D \\le 250\\,\\text{W}$$\n\nThe SOA is the region in the first quadrant ($V_{DS} \\ge 0$, $I_D \\ge 0$) that simultaneously satisfies all three constraints:\n-   $V_{DS} \\le 100$\n-   $I_D \\le 60$\n-   $V_{DS} \\cdot I_D \\le 250$\n\nWe now compute the vertices of the SOA polygon by tracing its boundary counterclockwise from the origin, as specified in the problem statement.

The fundamental voltage-current relation for an inductor is:\n$$v_L(t) = L \\frac{di_L(t)}{dt}$$\nWith the clamp holding the voltage at a constant $-V_{\\text{cl}}$ (negative because it opposes the current decrease), we have:\n$$-V_{\\text{cl}} = L \\frac{di_L}{dt}$$\nThis implies a constant rate of current change:\n$$\\frac{di_L}{dt} = -\\frac{V_{\\text{cl}}}{L}$$\nThe current therefore falls linearly from its initial value $I_0$ to $0$. The fall time $t_f$ is the duration required for this change.\n$$\\Delta I = I_{\\text{final}} - I_{\\text{initial}} = 0 - I_0 = -I_0$$\n$$t_f = \\frac{\\Delta I}{di_L/dt} = \\frac{-I_0}{-V_{\\text{cl}}/L} = \\frac{L I_0}{V_{\\text{cl}}}$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$t_f = \\frac{(500 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{H}) (30\\,\\text{A})}{100\\,\\text{V}} = \\frac{15000 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{s}}{100} = 150 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{s} = 150\\,\\mu\\text{s}$$\n\n**3. Average Power, Temperature Rise, and Peak Temperature**\nThe average power dissipation, $P_{\\text{avg}}$, is the total dissipated energy divided by the fall time:\n$$P_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{diss}}}{t_f} = \\frac{0.225\\,\\text{J}}{150 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{s}} = 1500\\,\\text{W}$$\nThe problem states that for a pulse width of $150\\,\\mu\\text{s}$, we can approximate the transient thermal impedance using the value given for $100\\,\\mu\\text{s}$.\n$$Z_{\\theta JC}(t_f) = Z_{\\theta JC}(150\\,\\mu\\text{s}) \\approx Z_{\\theta JC}(100\\,\\mu\\text{s}) = 0.1\\,\\text{K/W}$$\nNow, we calculate the junction-to-case temperature rise:\n$$\\Delta T_{jc,\\text{peak}} = P_{\\text{avg}} \\times Z_{\\theta JC}(t_f) = (1500\\,\\text{W}) \\times (0.1\\,\\text{K/W}) = 150\\,\\text{K}$$\nA temperature difference of $150\\,\\text{K}$ is equivalent to a temperature difference of $150\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$.\nFinally, the peak junction temperature is found by adding this rise to the case temperature:\n$$T_{j,\\text{peak}} = T_c + \\Delta T_{jc,\\text{peak}} = 50\\,^\\circ\\text{C} + 150\\,^\\circ\\text{C} = 200\\,^\\circ\\text{C}$$\nThe result is an integer. Rounding to three significant figures gives $200$.",
