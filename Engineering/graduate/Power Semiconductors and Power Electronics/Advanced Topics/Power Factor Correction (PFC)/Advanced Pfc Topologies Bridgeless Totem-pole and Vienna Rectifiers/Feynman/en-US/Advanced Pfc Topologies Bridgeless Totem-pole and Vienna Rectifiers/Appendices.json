This first exercise focuses on calculating the voltage stresses on its key semiconductor components. Understanding these maximum voltage ratings is the most critical first step in selecting appropriate active switches and diodes for a reliable power converter design .",

            "problem": "A three-phase, three-level Vienna rectifier is supplied from a three-phase grid with line-to-line root-mean-square voltage $V_{LL,\\mathrm{rms}} = 400\\ \\mathrm{V}$ and maintains a split direct-current link of total voltage $V_{dc} = 800\\ \\mathrm{V}$ across two equal capacitors in series. The midpoint of the two series capacitors defines a reference node with the upper and lower rails at $+\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$ and $-\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$, respectively. Each phase leg comprises an input inductor and a phase node that is connected to the upper and lower rails through ideal clamping diodes, and to the capacitor midpoint through an ideal unidirectional active switch. Assume ideal devices (zero forward drops), a perfectly balanced split direct-current link (each capacitor holds exactly $\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$), continuous conduction mode at unity displacement power factor, and that the control prevents any overmodulation so that the phase-node potential is always limited by the rails when the diodes conduct.\n\nStarting from Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law and the definitions of root-mean-square and peak values, derive the maximum off-state voltage stress across:\n- the active switch (i.e., the maximum drain-to-source voltage $V_{DS}$ across the device that connects the phase node to the midpoint), and\n- either clamping diode (i.e., the maximum reverse voltage $V_{R}$ across a diode connecting the phase node to one of the direct-current rails).\n\nUse the given numerical values to evaluate the stresses, and identify the minimum required ratings for the switch $V_{DS}$ and the diode $V_{R}$ under the stated assumptions. Express both ratings in volts. If you need any intermediate peak values of the phase voltage, use $V_{\\phi,\\mathrm{rms}} = \\frac{V_{LL,\\mathrm{rms}}}{\\sqrt{3}}$ and $V_{\\phi,\\mathrm{peak}} = \\sqrt{2}\\,V_{\\phi,\\mathrm{rms}}$ in your derivation without introducing empirical design margins. No rounding is required; provide exact numerical values obtained from the given data.",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and self-contained. It describes a standard power electronics scenario with ideal components, which is a valid approach for a first-order analysis of component stresses. The provided numerical values are consistent and physically realistic for the specified topology, and the assumptions are clearly stated. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe Vienna rectifier is a three-level pulse-width modulated (PWM) rectifier. The three voltage levels available at each phase node, with respect to the midpoint of the DC link, are determined by the state of the active switch and the two clamping diodes. Let the DC link midpoint be the reference node $O$, with potential $0$. The positive DC rail is at a potential of $+\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$ and the negative DC rail is at $-\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$. Let the potential of an arbitrary phase node (e.g., for phase A) be denoted by $v_p$.\n\nThe active switch connects the phase node to the midpoint $O$. The clamping diodes connect the phase node to the positive and negative rails.\nThere are three possible states for the phase node potential $v_p$:\n$1$. The active switch is ON. Under the assumption of an ideal switch, the phase node is directly connected to the midpoint. Thus, its potential is $v_p = 0$.\n$2$. The active switch is OFF, and the inductor current is flowing out of the phase node (e.g., for a positive source voltage). The current must flow to one of the DC rails. This forces the phase node potential $v_p$ to rise until it is clamped by the upper diode. Under the ideal diode assumption, the phase node potential becomes equal to the positive rail potential, i.e., $v_p = +\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$.\n$3$. The active switch is OFF, and the inductor current is flowing into the phase node (e.g., for a negative source voltage). This forces the phase node potential $v_p$ to fall until it is clamped by the lower diode. Under the ideal diode assumption, the phase node potential becomes equal to the negative rail potential, i.e., $v_p = -\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$.\n\nThe problem statement gives the grid line-to-line RMS voltage $V_{LL,\\mathrm{rms}} = 400\\ \\mathrm{V}$ and the total DC link voltage $V_{dc} = 800\\ \\mathrm{V}$. The problem also states that overmodulation is prevented. This implies that the peak phase voltage must be less than half the DC-link voltage. Let us verify this condition. The peak phase voltage $V_{\\phi,\\mathrm{peak}}$ is given by:\n$$V_{\\phi,\\mathrm{peak}} = \\sqrt{2}\\,V_{\\phi,\\mathrm{rms}} = \\sqrt{2}\\left(\\frac{V_{LL,\\mathrm{rms}}}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)$$\n$$V_{\\phi,\\mathrm{peak}} = \\sqrt{2}\\left(\\frac{400}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = \\frac{400\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{3}}\\ \\mathrm{V} \\approx 326.6\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\nHalf the DC link voltage is:\n$$\\frac{V_{dc}}{2} = \\frac{800}{2} = 400\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\nSince $V_{\\phi,\\mathrm{peak}} \\approx 326.6\\ \\mathrm{V} < 400\\ \\mathrm{V}$, the condition $\\left|V_{\\phi,\\mathrm{peak}}\\right| < \\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$ is satisfied. This confirms the physical possibility of operating without overmodulation, as stated in the problem. The input voltage does not directly determine the device stresses in this idealized topology, but rather confirms the validity of the operating mode.\n\nNow, we derive the voltage stresses based on the structure of the converter and the DC link voltage.\n\n**1. Maximum Off-State Voltage Stress on the Active Switch ($V_{DS,\\text{max}}$)**\n\nThe active switch is connected between the phase node (potential $v_p$) and the DC link midpoint (potential $0$). The voltage across the switch, $V_{DS}$, is therefore equal to the phase node potential, $V_{DS} = v_p - 0 = v_p$.\nThe maximum voltage stress occurs when the switch is in the OFF state. As established, in the OFF state, the phase node potential $v_p$ is clamped to either $+\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$ or $-\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$.\nThe voltage across the switch can thus be either $+\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$ or $-\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$. The maximum off-state voltage stress is the maximum absolute value of these potentials:\n$$V_{DS,\\text{max}} = \\max\\left(\\left|+\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}\\right|, \\left|-\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}\\right|\\right) = \\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$$\nThis is the minimum required drain-to-source voltage rating for the switch.\nUsing the given numerical value $V_{dc} = 800\\ \\mathrm{V}$:\n$$V_{DS,\\text{max}} = \\frac{800}{2} = 400\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\n\n**2. Maximum Reverse Voltage Stress on a Clamping Diode ($V_{R,\\text{max}}$)**\n\nLet's consider the upper clamping diode. Its anode is connected to the positive DC rail ($+\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$) and its cathode is connected to the phase node (potential $v_p$). A diode experiences reverse voltage when its cathode potential is higher than its anode potential. However, the reverse voltage rating, $V_R$, specifies the maximum voltage the diode can block. This is the maximum value of $V_{\\text{anode}} - V_{\\text{cathode}}$.\nThe voltage across the upper diode is $V_D = (+\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}) - v_p$.\nThe maximum reverse voltage occurs when this difference is maximized. This happens when the phase node potential $v_p$ is at its minimum value.\nFrom our analysis of the converter states, the minimum potential of the phase node is $v_{p,\\text{min}} = -\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for the diode voltage:\n$$V_{R,\\text{max}} = \\left(+\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}\\right) - v_{p,\\text{min}} = \\left(+\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{V_{dc}}{2} + \\frac{V_{dc}}{2} = V_{dc}$$\nBy symmetry, let's analyze the lower clamping diode. Its anode is connected to the phase node ($v_p$) and its cathode is connected to the negative DC rail ($-\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$). The reverse voltage is given by $V_{\\text{cathode}} - V_{\\text{anode}}$.\nThe maximum reverse voltage is thus $(-\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}) - v_p$, maximized. This occurs when $v_p$ is at its maximum value, $v_{p,\\text{max}} = +\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}$.\n$$V_{R,\\text{max}} = \\left|-\\frac{V_{dc}}{2} - v_{p,\\text{max}}\\right| = \\left|-\\frac{V_{dc}}{2} - \\left(+\\frac{V_{dc}}{2}\\right)\\right| = \\left|-V_{dc}\\right| = V_{dc}$$\nThus, the maximum reverse voltage stress is the same for both upper and lower diodes and is equal to the total DC link voltage. This is the minimum required reverse voltage rating for the diodes.\nUsing the given numerical value $V_{dc} = 800\\ \\mathrm{V}$:\n$$V_{R,\\text{max}} = 800\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\n\nThe minimum required ratings are $400\\ \\mathrm{V}$ for the active switch and $800\\ \\mathrm{V}$ for the clamping diodes.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It presents a standard power electronics analysis problem with clear, simplified device models and sufficient data for a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a full solution can be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation and calculation of conduction power dissipation in three different PFC front-end conduction paths. The input current $i(t)$ is given as a pure sinusoid with a root-mean-square (RMS) value of $I_{\\mathrm{rms}} = 10\\,\\text{A}$.

The instantaneous voltage drop is $v_{\\mathrm{b}}(t) = R_{\\mathrm{b}}i(t)$. The average conduction power dissipation, $P_{\\mathrm{b}}$, is derived as follows:\n    $$P_{\\mathrm{b}} = \\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} v_{\\mathrm{b}}(t)i(t) \\,dt = \\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} (R_{\\mathrm{b}}i(t))i(t) \\,dt = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{b}}}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} i(t)^2 \\,dt$$\n    By the definition of RMS current, $I_{\\mathrm{rms}}^2 = \\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} i(t)^2 \\,dt$. Substituting this into the power equation gives the expression for the conduction power:\n    $$P_{\\mathrm{b}} = R_{\\mathrm{b}}I_{\\mathrm{rms}}^2$$\n\n2.  **Conduction Power of the Totem-Pole Path ($P_{\\mathrm{tp}}$)**\n    For the totem-pole PFC, two series GaN HEMT devices conduct, each with an on-state resistance of $R_{\\mathrm{tp}} = 15\\,\\mathrm{m}\\Omega = 0.015\\,\\Omega$. The total series resistance in the conduction path is $2R_{\\mathrm{tp}}$. The instantaneous voltage drop is $v_{\\mathrm{tp}}(t) = (2R_{\\mathrm{tp}})i(t)$. The derivation for the average power, $P_{\\mathrm{tp}}$, is analogous to the bridgeless case:\n    $$P_{\\mathrm{tp}} = \\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} v_{\\mathrm{tp}}(t)i(t) \\,dt = \\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} (2R_{\\mathrm{tp}}i(t))i(t) \\,dt = \\frac{2R_{\\mathrm{tp}}}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} i(t)^2 \\,dt$$\n    Using the definition of RMS current as before:\n    $$P_{\\mathrm{tp}} = (2R_{\\mathrm{tp}})I_{\\mathrm{rms}}^2$$\n\n3.  **Conduction Power of the Diode Path ($P_{\\mathrm{d}}$)**\n    For the diode path, the forward voltage drop is a constant $V_{\\mathrm{f}} = 0.9\\,\\text{V}$. In a full-wave rectification context, current flows through a path with this voltage drop during both the positive and negative halves of the line cycle. The instantaneous power dissipation is $p_{\\mathrm{d}}(t) = v_{\\mathrm{d}}(t)i(t)$. The voltage drop opposes the current flow, so its magnitude is always $V_{\\mathrm{f}}$, and its sign is the same as the current's sign. Thus, the instantaneous power is $p_{\\mathrm{d}}(t) = V_{\\mathrm{f}}|i(t)|$.\n\n    The average power dissipation, $P_{\\mathrm{d}}$, is found by averaging this instantaneous power over one period:\n    $$P_{\\mathrm{d}} = \\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} V_{\\mathrm{f}}|i(t)| \\,dt = V_{\\mathrm{f}} \\left(\\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} |i(t)| \\,dt\\right)$$\n    The term in the parenthesis is the average magnitude of the rectified current, $I_{\\mathrm{avg}}$.

The peak input voltage $V_{in,pk}$ is related to the RMS voltage $v_{in}$ by:\n    $$V_{in,pk} = v_{in} \\sqrt{2} = 90\\sqrt{2}\\ \\text{V}$$\n    Since the PFC operates at unity power factor, the input current $i_{in}(t)$ is also sinusoidal and in phase with the voltage, $i_{in}(t) = I_{in,pk}\\sin(\\omega t)$. The average input power $P$ is given by $P = v_{in} I_{in,rms}$, where $I_{in,rms}$ is the RMS input current.\n    $$I_{in,rms} = \\frac{P}{v_{in}} = \\frac{1000\\ \\text{W}}{90\\ \\text{V}_{\\text{rms}}}$$\n    The peak input current $I_{in,pk}$ is:\n    $$I_{in,pk} = I_{in,rms} \\sqrt{2} = \\frac{P}{v_{in}}\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{1000}{90}\\sqrt{2}\\ \\text{A} = \\frac{100\\sqrt{2}}{9}\\ \\text{A}$$\n    This is the peak value of the fundamental component of the inductor current.\n\n2.  **Analysis at the Line-Voltage Peak**\n    The totem-pole PFC operates as a boost converter. The analysis is performed at the instant when the line voltage reaches its peak, $V_{in,pk}$. At this point, the average inductor current is $I_{in,pk}$. The duty cycle $D$ of the boost switch is determined by the input-output voltage relationship: $V_o = \\frac{|v_{in}(t)|}{1-D(t)}$.\n    At the voltage peak, the duty cycle $D_{peak}$ is:\n    $$D_{peak} = 1 - \\frac{V_{in,pk}}{V_o}$$\n\n3.  **Inductor Ripple Current**\n    In CCM, the inductor current ripple, $|\\Delta i_L|$, is determined by the voltage across the inductor during the switch ON-time or OFF-time. During the ON-time ($DT_{sw}$), the inductor voltage is $v_L = |v_{in}(t)|$. The peak-to-peak ripple current is:\n    $$|\\Delta i_L| = \\frac{|v_{in}(t)| D(t) T_{sw}}{L} = \\frac{|v_{in}(t)| D(t)}{L f_{sw}}$$\n    where $T_{sw}=1/f_{sw}$ is the switching period. Evaluating this at the line-voltage peak:\n    $$|\\Delta i_L| = \\frac{V_{in,pk} D_{peak}}{L f_{sw}} = \\frac{V_{in,pk}}{L f_{sw}}\\left(1 - \\frac{V_{in,pk}}{V_o}\\right) = \\frac{V_{in,pk}(V_o - V_{in,pk})}{L V_o f_{sw}}$$\n\n4.  **Ripple Constraint**\n    The problem specifies the constraint $|\\Delta i_{L}|/I_{pk} < 0.1$. The maximum instantaneous inductor current $I_{pk}$ is the sum of the average current at that instant ($I_{in,pk}$) and half the peak-to-peak ripple:\n    $$I_{pk} = I_{in,pk} + \\frac{|\\Delta i_L|}{2}$$\n    Substituting this into the constraint:\n    $$\\frac{|\\Delta i_L|}{I_{in,pk} + \\frac{|\\Delta i_L|}{2}} < 0.1$$\n    To find the minimum frequency, we solve for the boundary condition where equality holds. Let the limit on the ripple be $|\\Delta i_{L,max}|$.\n    $$\\frac{|\\Delta i_{L,max}|}{I_{in,pk} + \\frac{|\\Delta i_{L,max}|}{2}} = 0.1$$\n    $$|\\Delta i_{L,max}| = 0.1 \\left(I_{in,pk} + \\frac{|\\Delta i_{L,max}|}{2}\\right)$$\n    $$|\\Delta i_{L,max}| = 0.1 I_{in,pk} + 0.05 |\\Delta i_{L,max}|$$\n    $$0.95 |\\Delta i_{L,max}| = 0.1 I_{in,pk}$$\n    $$|\\Delta i_{L,max}| = \\frac{0.1}{0.95} I_{in,pk} = \\frac{10}{95} I_{in,pk} = \\frac{2}{19} I_{in,pk}$$\n\n5.  **Solving for Minimum Switching Frequency**\n    The minimum switching frequency $f_{sw,min}$ occurs when the actual ripple $|\\Delta i_L|$ equals the maximum allowed ripple $|\\Delta i_{L,max}|$.\n    $$\\frac{V_{in,pk}(V_o - V_{in,pk})}{L V_o f_{sw,min}} = \\frac{2}{19} I_{in,pk}$$\n    Solving for $f_{sw,min}$:\n    $$f_{sw,min} = \\frac{19}{2} \\frac{V_{in,pk}(V_o - V_{in,pk})}{L V_o I_{in,pk}}$$\n    We can substitute $I_{in,pk} = \\frac{2P}{V_{in,pk}}$ (since $P = \\frac{V_{in,pk} I_{in,pk}}{2}$ for sinusoidal waveforms):\n    $$f_{sw,min} = \\frac{19}{2} \\frac{V_{in,pk}(V_o - V_{in,pk})}{L V_o} \\frac{V_{in,pk}}{2P}$$\n    $$f_{sw,min} = \\frac{19}{4} \\frac{V_{in,pk}^2 (V_o - V_{in,pk})}{L V_o P}$$\n\n6.  **Numerical Calculation**\n    Substituting the given values:\n    -   $V_{in,pk} = 90\\sqrt{2}\\ \\text{V}$\n    -   $V_o = 400\\ \\text{V}$\n    -   $L = 400 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{H}$\n    -   $P = 1000\\ \\text{W}$\n\n    $$f_{sw,min} = \\frac{19}{4} \\frac{(90\\sqrt{2})^2 (400 - 90\\sqrt{2})}{(400 \\times 10^{-6})(400)(1000)}$$\n    $$f_{sw,min} = \\frac{19}{4} \\frac{8100 \\times 2 \\times (400 - 90\\sqrt{2})}{160}$$\n    $$f_{sw,min} = \\frac{19}{4} \\frac{16200 (400 - 90\\sqrt{2})}{160} = \\frac{19 \\times 1620 \\times (400 - 90\\sqrt{2})}{64}$$\n    $$f_{sw,min} = \\frac{19 \\times 405 \\times (400 - 90\\sqrt{2})}{16} = \\frac{7695 (400 - 90\\sqrt{2})}{16}$$\n    Using $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.41421356$:\n    $$90\\sqrt{2} \\approx 127.27922$$\n    $$f_{sw,min} \\approx \\frac{7695 (400 - 127.27922)}{16} = \\frac{7695 \\times 272.72078}{16}$$\n    $$f_{sw,min} \\approx \\frac{2098597.9}{16} \\approx 131162.37\\ \\text{Hz}$$\n    The problem requires the answer in kHz, rounded to four significant figures.\n    $$f_{sw,min} \\approx 131.16237\\ \\text{kHz}$$\n    Rounding to four significant figures gives $131.2\\ \\text{kHz}$.",
