            "problem": "An $N$-phase interleaved boost front-end used for Power Factor Correction (PFC) is fed from a single-phase sinusoidal source of line angular frequency $\\omega$ and peak voltage $V_{m}$. An ideal full-wave diode bridge precedes the interleaved boost stage so that the input to each boost phase is the rectified sinusoid $v_{g}(t)=V_{m}|\\sin(\\omega t)|$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is first subjected to a rigorous validation process.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **System Description**: An $N$-phase interleaved boost front-end for Power Factor Correction (PFC).\n- **Input Source**: Single-phase sinusoidal source with line angular frequency $\\omega$ and peak voltage $V_{m}$.\n- **Rectifier**: Ideal full-wave diode bridge.\n- **Input to Boost Stage**: Rectified sinusoid $v_{g}(t)=V_{m}|\\sin(\\omega t)|$.\n- **Boost Stage Configuration**: $N$ identical boost phases, operating in continuous conduction mode (CCM), uniformly interleaved in switching phase by $2\\pi/N$.\n- **Switching Frequency**: $f_{s}$, satisfying the condition $2\\pi f_{s}\\gg \\omega$.\n- **Output**: A regulated constant DC voltage $V_{o}$ across a large output capacitor.\n- **Assumptions**:\n    1. Ideal semiconductors (zero conduction and switching losses).\n    2. Negligible parasitic elements.\n    3. Negligible output voltage ripple (i.e., output voltage is a pure DC value, $V_o$).\n    4. Time-scale separation ($2\\pi f_s \\gg \\omega$), the input voltage $v_g(t)$ is considered constant over a single switching period $T_s = 1/f_s$.\n- **Constraints**:\n    1. $0 < v_{g}(t) < V_{o}$ for all $t$.\n    2. $0 < D(t) < 1$.\n- **Task**: Derive the ideal instantaneous duty cycle $D(t)$ from first principles: (1) inductor voltage–time balance over one switching period, and (2) conservation of energy at steady state.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is analyzed for validity.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem describes a standard power electronics circuit (an interleaved boost PFC converter) and requests a derivation based on fundamental, universally accepted principles: inductor volt-second balance and conservation of energy. The model is idealized, which is a standard and valid practice for deriving fundamental operating equations. The setup is entirely consistent with the laws of physics and circuit theory.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides sufficient information and a clear set of assumptions (CCM, ideal components, time-scale separation) to allow for the derivation of a unique, stable, and meaningful expression for the duty cycle $D(t)$. The goal is unambiguously defined. The information about the $N$-phase interleaving is descriptive of the converter architecture but, as the problem notes by specifying a common duty cycle $D(t)$, does not alter the fundamental voltage conversion relationship being derived.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, technical language, free from subjective or biased terms.\n- **Conclusion**: The problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and contains no internal contradictions or ambiguities. It is a standard, fundamental problem in power electronics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. The derivation of the solution will now proceed.\n\nThe objective is to derive the expression for the instantaneous duty cycle, $D(t)$, for an ideal boost converter. The problem specifies that this derivation must be based on two principles: inductor volt-second balance and conservation of energy. The analysis is performed on a single phase of the interleaved converter, as the duty cycle is stipulated to be common to all phases.\n\nThe operation of a boost converter in continuous conduction mode (CCM) over a single switching period $T_s = 1/f_s$ is characterized by two states. Let the main switch (e.g., a MOSFET) be turned on for a duration of $D(t)T_s$ and off for a duration of $(1-D(t))T_s$.\n\n**1. Derivation from Inductor Voltage–Time Balance (Volt-Second Balance)**\n\nThe principle of inductor volt-second balance states that for periodic operation, the average voltage across the inductor over one full period must be zero. Here, the period is the switching period $T_s$. The time-scale separation assumption, $f_s \\gg \\omega/(2\\pi)$, justifies treating the low-frequency input voltage $v_g(t)$ and the control variable $D(t)$ as constant within this short interval.\n\n- **State 1: Switch is ON (duration $D(t)T_s$)**: The inductor is connected directly across the input voltage source. The voltage across the inductor, $v_L$, is equal to the input voltage at that instant.\n$$v_L = v_g(t)$$\n- **State 2: Switch is OFF (duration $(1-D(t))T_s$)**: The inductor current is directed to the output through the boost diode. The voltage across the inductor is the input voltage minus the output voltage.\n$$v_L = v_g(t) - V_o$$\nApplying the volt-second balance principle, we integrate the inductor voltage over one switching period $T_s$ and set the average to zero:\n$$\\frac{1}{T_s} \\int_0^{T_s} v_L(\\tau) d\\tau = 0$$\n$$\\frac{1}{T_s} \\left[ \\int_0^{D(t)T_s} v_g(t) d\\tau + \\int_{D(t)T_s}^{T_s} (v_g(t) - V_o) d\\tau \\right] = 0$$\nSince $v_g(t)$ and $V_o$ are constant over this interval, the integration is straightforward:\n$$[v_g(t) \\cdot D(t)T_s] + [(v_g(t) - V_o) \\cdot (1-D(t))T_s] = 0$$\nDividing by $T_s$:\n$$v_g(t)D(t) + (v_g(t) - V_o)(1 - D(t)) = 0$$\n$$v_g(t)D(t) + v_g(t) - v_g(t)D(t) - V_o + V_o D(t) = 0$$\n$$v_g(t) - V_o + V_o D(t) = 0$$\nThis yields the fundamental voltage conversion ratio for a boost converter:\n$$V_o(1 - D(t)) = v_g(t)$$\n\n**2. Derivation from Conservation of Energy (Instantaneous Power Balance)**\n\nFor an ideal converter with no energy storage elements that accumulate net energy over a cycle and no loss mechanisms, the instantaneous input power must equal the instantaneous output power. This is a direct consequence of the conservation of energy. Let $i_L(t)$ be the slowly varying (line-frequency component) of the inductor current.\n\n- **Instantaneous Input Power**: The power drawn from the input source is $p_{in}(t) = v_g(t) i_{in}(t)$. In a boost converter, the input current is the inductor current, so $i_{in}(t) = i_L(t)$.\n$$p_{in}(t) = v_g(t) i_L(t)$$\n- **Instantaneous Output Power**: Power is delivered to the output only when the boost diode is conducting, which occurs during the switch OFF-time. The current delivered to the output is the inductor current $i_L(t)$ during this interval. Averaged over a switching cycle $T_s$, the output current is $i_{out}(t) = (1-D(t)) i_L(t)$. The power delivered to the constant voltage output is $p_{out}(t) = V_o i_{out}(t)$.\n$$p_{out}(t) = V_o (1-D(t)) i_L(t)$$\nBy equating instantaneous input and output power, $p_{in}(t) = p_{out}(t)$:\n$$v_g(t) i_L(t) = V_o (1-D(t)) i_L(t)$$\nSince the converter operates in CCM, the inductor current $i_L(t)$ is always positive. We can therefore divide by $i_L(t)$:\n$$v_g(t) = V_o (1-D(t))$$\nThis result is identical to the one obtained from volt-second balance. This is expected, as both principles are fundamental and must be simultaneously satisfied in a consistent, idealized physical model.\n\n**3. Final Expression for the Duty Cycle**\n\nFrom the derived relationship, we solve for the instantaneous duty cycle $D(t)$.\n$$1 - D(t) = \\frac{v_g(t)}{V_o}$$\n$$D(t) = 1 - \\frac{v_g(t)}{V_o}$$\nThe problem provides the expression for the rectified input voltage to the boost stage:\n$$v_g(t) = V_m |\\sin(\\omega t)|$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $D(t)$:\n$$D(t) = 1 - \\frac{V_m |\\sin(\\omega t)|}{V_o}$$\nThis is the final expression for the ideal instantaneous duty cycle required to shape the input current for power factor correction while maintaining a regulated output voltage $V_o$. The constraint $v_g(t) < V_o$ ensures that $D(t)$ remains positive, and $v_g(t) > 0$ ensures $D(t) < 1$, consistent with the problem's assumptions.",

The total input current $i_g(t)$ is shaped to be in phase with $v_g(t)$, so $i_g(t) = I_p \\left|\\sin(\\omega t)\\right|$, where $I_p$ is the peak total input current.

At this instant, the input voltage is at its peak, $v_g = V_p$, and the total input current is also at its peak, $i_g = I_p$. This total current is distributed among the $N$ interleaved phases.

The ripple is determined by the inductor voltage, duty cycle, and switching period $T_s = 1/f_s$. The duty cycle $D(t)$ at any instant is $D(t) = 1 - v_{\\text{in}}(t)/v_{\\text{o}}$.

Thus, the peak current stress is identical for all three components.\n$$I_{\\ell,\\text{peak}} = I_{\\text{sw,peak}} = I_{\\text{d,peak}} = I_{\\text{peak}}$$\n$$I_{\\text{peak}} = 10\\sqrt{2} + \\frac{5(\\sqrt{2}-1)}{2} = 10\\sqrt{2} + \\frac{5}{2}\\sqrt{2} - \\frac{5}{2} = \\left(10 + \\frac{5}{2}\\right)\\sqrt{2} - \\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{25}{2}\\sqrt{2} - \\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{5}{2}(5\\sqrt{2}-1)~\\text{A}$$\nNumerically, this peak current is:\n$$I_{\\text{peak}} \\approx \\frac{5}{2}(5 \\times 1.41421 - 1) = \\frac{5}{2}(7.07105 - 1) = \\frac{5}{2}(6.07105) \\approx 15.1776~\\text{A}$$\n\nNow, we compute the normalized stress ratio for each component:\n- Inductor stress ratio: $S_L = \\frac{I_{\\text{peak}}}{I_{\\text{sat}}} = \\frac{15.1776~\\text{A}}{15.0~\\text{A}} \\approx 1.01184$\n- MOSFET stress ratio: $S_{\\text{sw}} = \\frac{I_{\\text{peak}}}{I_{\\text{sw,pk}}} = \\frac{15.1776~\\text{A}}{20.0~\\text{A}} \\approx 0.75888$\n- Diode stress ratio: $S_D = \\frac{I_{\\text{peak}}}{I_{\\text{d,pk}}} = \\frac{15.1776~\\text{A}}{22.0~\\text{A}} \\approx 0.68989$\n\nThe largest of these three ratios is $S_L$, the stress ratio for the inductor.\n$$S_{\\text{max}} = S_L = \\frac{\\frac{5}{2}(5\\sqrt{2}-1)}{15} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}-1}{6}$$\nEvaluating this numerically:\n$$S_{\\text{max}} \\approx \\frac{5(1.41421356) - 1}{6} = \\frac{7.0710678 - 1}{6} = \\frac{6.0710678}{6} \\approx 1.0118446$$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives 1.012.",
