            "introduction": "In modern power electronics, many sub-circuits do not share a common ground reference, such as the isolated gate drivers used for high-side switches. Analyzing these configurations requires a robust application of Kirchhoff's laws, specifically the supernode technique, which is a direct consequence of Kirchhoff's Current and Voltage Laws. This practice will challenge you to apply KCL and KVL to a realistic DC model of a gate drive and switching node, reinforcing your ability to solve for node potentials in circuits containing ideal floating voltage sources .",

            "problem": "A high-side Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) in a synchronous buck converter is driven by an isolated gate driver that presents an ideal floating voltage source between the gate node $g$ and the source node $s$. The driver enforces a constant gate-to-source potential $V_{GS0}$, such that $V_{g}-V_{s}=V_{GS0}$. The switching node $s$ is connected to ground through a stray path modeled by a resistor $R_{s}$, and it is also fed from a stiff direct-current bus at potential $V_{d}$ through a series resistor $R_{d}$ (the bus node is outside the supernode formed by $g$ and $s$). A gate-to-ground bleeder resistor $R_{g}$ models gate leakage. The load connected to the switching node is represented, over the slow time scale of interest, as a constant current sink of magnitude $I_{L}$ from node $s$ to ground. All quantities are direct-current values, and parasitic capacitances and inductances are neglected.\n\nUsing Kirchhoff's Current Law and Kirchhoff's Voltage Law as the only starting points, determine the steady-state absolute potential of the switching node $V_{s}$ with respect to ground for the following parameter values: $V_{GS0}=15\\,\\text{V}$, $R_{g}=4.0\\times 10^{6}\\,\\Omega$, $R_{s}=2.0\\,\\Omega$, $R_{d}=8.0\\,\\Omega$, $V_{d}=400\\,\\text{V}$, and $I_{L}=30\\,\\text{A}$. Express your final answer in volts and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires us to determine the steady-state potential of the switching node, $V_s$, with respect to ground. The circuit can be analyzed using Kirchhoff's circuit laws. Let ground be the reference potential, defined as $0\\,\\text{V}$. The potentials of the gate and source nodes are denoted by $V_g$ and $V_s$, respectively.\n\nThe circuit consists of the following elements:\n1. A DC voltage bus at a potential $V_d$.\n2. A resistor $R_d$ connecting the bus at $V_d$ to the source node $s$.\n3. A stray resistor $R_s$ connecting the source node $s$ to ground.\n4. A constant current sink of magnitude $I_L$ drawing current from the source node $s$ to ground.\n5. A gate bleeder resistor $R_g$ connecting the gate node $g$ to ground.\n6. An ideal floating voltage source representing the gate driver, which maintains a constant potential difference between the gate and source nodes, such that $V_g - V_s = V_{GS0}$.\n\nWe have two unknown node potentials, $V_s$ and $V_g$. To solve for these, we need two independent equations. These equations are derived from Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) and Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL).\n\nFirst, the relationship imposed by the ideal gate driver is a direct application of KVL. Taking a loop from the source node $s$, through the driver to the gate node $g$, we are given:\n$$V_g - V_s = V_{GS0} \\quad (1)$$\nThis is our first primary equation.\n\nSecond, we apply KCL. We can define a supernode that encloses the gate node $g$, the source node $s$, and the ideal voltage source between them. KCL states that the algebraic sum of currents leaving the supernode must be zero. The currents leaving the supernode are:\n- The current through the gate resistor $R_g$ from node $g$ to ground. Using Ohm's Law, this current is $I_{R_g} = \\frac{V_g}{R_g}$.\n- The current through the series resistor $R_d$. This current flows from the bus at $V_d$ to node $s$. The current leaving the supernode at node $s$ through $R_d$ is $I_{R_d} = \\frac{V_s - V_d}{R_d}$.\n- The current through the stray resistor $R_s$ from node $s$ to ground. Using Ohm's Law, this current is $I_{R_s} = \\frac{V_s}{R_s}$.\n- The current drawn by the constant current sink from node $s$ to ground, which is given as $I_L$.\n\nSumming these currents and setting the total to zero according to KCL:\n$$I_{R_g} + I_{R_d} + I_{R_s} + I_L = 0$$\n$$\\frac{V_g}{R_g} + \\frac{V_s - V_d}{R_d} + \\frac{V_s}{R_s} + I_L = 0 \\quad (2)$$\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations, $(1)$ and $(2)$, with two unknowns, $V_s$ and $V_g$. We can solve this system. From equation $(1)$, we express $V_g$ in terms of $V_s$:\n$$V_g = V_s + V_{GS0}$$\nSubstitute this expression for $V_g$ into equation $(2)$:\n$$\\frac{V_s + V_{GS0}}{R_g} + \\frac{V_s - V_d}{R_d} + \\frac{V_s}{R_s} + I_L = 0$$\nWe now rearrange the equation to solve for $V_s$. We first separate the terms containing $V_s$:\n$$\\frac{V_s}{R_g} + \\frac{V_{GS0}}{R_g} + \\frac{V_s}{R_d} - \\frac{V_d}{R_d} + \\frac{V_s}{R_s} + I_L = 0$$\nGroup the terms with $V_s$ on one side and all other terms on the other side:\n$$V_s \\left( \\frac{1}{R_g} + \\frac{1}{R_d} + \\frac{1}{R_s} \\right) = \\frac{V_d}{R_d} - \\frac{V_{GS0}}{R_g} - I_L$$\nFinally, we can write the symbolic expression for $V_s$:\n$$V_s = \\frac{\\frac{V_d}{R_d} - I_L - \\frac{V_{GS0}}{R_g}}{\\frac{1}{R_d} + \\frac{1}{R_s} + \\frac{1}{R_g}}$$\n\nNow we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $V_{GS0} = 15\\,\\text{V}$\n- $R_g = 4.0 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\Omega$\n- $R_s = 2.0\\,\\Omega$\n- $R_d = 8.0\\,\\Omega$\n- $V_d = 400\\,\\text{V}$\n- $I_L = 30\\,\\text{A}$\n\nLet's compute the terms in the numerator and denominator.\nNumerator:\n$$\\frac{V_d}{R_d} - I_L - \\frac{V_{GS0}}{R_g} = \\frac{400}{8.0} - 30 - \\frac{15}{4.0 \\times 10^{6}} = 50 - 30 - 3.75 \\times 10^{-6} = 19.99999625\\,\\text{A}$$\nDenominator:\n$$\\frac{1}{R_d} + \\frac{1}{R_s} + \\frac{1}{R_g} = \\frac{1}{8.0} + \\frac{1}{2.0} + \\frac{1}{4.0 \\times 10^{6}} = 0.125 + 0.5 + 0.25 \\times 10^{-6} = 0.62500025\\,\\Omega^{-1}$$\nNow, we calculate $V_s$:\n$$V_s = \\frac{19.99999625}{0.62500025} \\approx 31.99998800\\,\\text{V}$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.
