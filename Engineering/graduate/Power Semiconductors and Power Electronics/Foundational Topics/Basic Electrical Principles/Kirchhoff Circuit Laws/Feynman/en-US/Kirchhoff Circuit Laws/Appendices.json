            "solution": "The problem requires us to determine the unknown probe capacitance, $C_p$, by applying Kirchhoff's current law (KCL) at the switching node of the buck converter during the high-side MOSFET turn-on transition.\n\nThe switching node is the point connecting the high-side MOSFET, the low-side MOSFET, and the inductor. During the turn-on of the high-side MOSFET, the current delivered by this transistor, $i_{\\mathrm{HS}}(t)$, flows into this node.

            "solution": "The problem statement describes an ideal boost DC-DC converter and asks for the derivation of the boundary condition separating continuous conduction mode (CCM) and discontinuous conduction mode (DCM). The analysis will be performed under steady-state conditions, using the principles of inductor volt-second balance and capacitor charge balance, which are direct consequences of Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) and Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL), respectively, applied over a switching period $T_s$.\n\nFirst, we derive the voltage conversion ratio $M = V_o/V_g$ for the continuous conduction mode (CCM). In CCM, the inductor current $i_L(t)$ remains positive for the entire switching period $T_s$. The operation consists of two subintervals:\n1.  Interval $1$ (switch ON, $0 < t \\le DT_s$): The switch is closed, connecting the inductor across the input voltage source $V_g$. Applying KVL to the input loop gives the inductor voltage $v_L(t) = V_g$.\n2.  Interval $2$ (switch OFF, $DT_s < t \\le T_s$): The switch is open, and the inductor delivers energy to the output stage. Applying KVL to the loop containing the source, inductor, diode, and output capacitor gives $V_g - v_L(t) - V_o = 0$, which implies $v_L(t) = V_g - V_o$.\n\nIn steady state, the principle of inductor volt-second balance requires that the average voltage across the inductor over one switching period is zero.\n$$ \\frac{1}{T_s} \\int_{0}^{T_s} v_L(t) dt = 0 $$\n$$ \\int_{0}^{DT_s} V_g \\, dt + \\int_{DT_s}^{T_s} (V_g - V_o) \\, dt = 0 $$\n$$ V_g (DT_s) + (V_g - V_o)(T_s - DT_s) = 0 $$\nDividing by $T_s$, we get:\n$$ V_g D + (V_g - V_o)(1-D) = 0 $$\n$$ V_g D + V_g - V_g D - V_o (1-D) = 0 $$\n$$ V_g - V_o(1-D) = 0 $$\nSolving for the voltage conversion ratio $M_{CCM} = V_o/V_g$:\n$$ M_{CCM}(D) = \\frac{V_o}{V_g} = \\frac{1}{1-D} $$\n\nSecond, we derive the voltage conversion ratio for the discontinuous conduction mode (DCM). In DCM, the inductor current falls to zero before the end of the switching period. The operation is characterized by three subintervals:\n1.  Interval $1$ ($0 < t \\le DT_s$): The switch is ON, and $v_L(t) = V_g$. The inductor current starts at $i_L(0)=0$ and ramps up to a peak value $i_{L,pk}$ at $t=DT_s$.\n    $$ i_{L,pk} = \\frac{V_g}{L}(DT_s) $$\n2.  Interval $2$ ($DT_s < t \\le (D+d_2)T_s$): The switch is OFF, and $v_L(t) = V_g - V_o$. The inductor current ramps down from $i_{L,pk}$ to zero over a duration of $d_2 T_s$.\n3.  Interval $3$ ($(D+d_2)T_s < t \\le T_s$): The inductor current remains zero, so $v_L(t) = 0$.\n\nApplying the volt-second balance principle for DCM:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{DT_s} V_g \\, dt + \\int_{DT_s}^{(D+d_2)T_s} (V_g - V_o) \\, dt + \\int_{(D+d_2)T_s}^{T_s} 0 \\, dt = 0 $$\n$$ V_g(DT_s) + (V_g - V_o)(d_2 T_s) = 0 $$\n$$ D V_g + d_2(V_g - V_o) = 0 $$\nFrom this, we can express $d_2$ in terms of the voltages and the duty cycle $D$:\n$$ d_2 = \\frac{D V_g}{V_o - V_g} $$\nNext, we apply the principle of capacitor charge balance, a consequence of KCL at the output node. In steady state, the average current into the capacitor is zero, so the average load current $I_o = V_o/R$ must equal the average diode current $\\langle i_D \\rangle$. The diode conducts only during the second interval, and its current $i_D(t)$ is equal to the inductor current $i_L(t)$ during that time.\n$$ \\langle i_D \\rangle = \\frac{1}{T_s} \\int_{DT_s}^{(D+d_2)T_s} i_L(t) \\, dt $$\nThe integral represents the area of a triangle with height $i_{L,pk}$ and base $d_2 T_s$.\n$$ \\langle i_D \\rangle = \\frac{1}{T_s} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} i_{L,pk} (d_2 T_s) \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} i_{L,pk} d_2 $$\nSetting $\\langle i_D \\rangle = I_o$:\n$$ \\frac{V_o}{R} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{V_g D T_s}{L} \\right) d_2 $$\nSubstitute the expression for $d_2$:\n$$ \\frac{V_o}{R} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{V_g D T_s}{L} \\left( \\frac{D V_g}{V_o - V_g} \\right) = \\frac{V_g^2 D^2 T_s}{2L(V_o-V_g)} $$\nLet the voltage conversion ratio be $M = V_o/V_g$. Then $V_o = M V_g$.\n$$ \\frac{M V_g}{R} = \\frac{V_g^2 D^2 T_s}{2L(M V_g - V_g)} = \\frac{V_g D^2 T_s}{2L(M-1)} $$\n$$ M(M-1) = \\frac{R D^2 T_s}{2L} $$\nUsing the given definition of the normalized load parameter, $K = \\frac{2L}{R T_{s}}$, we can write $\\frac{R T_s}{2L} = \\frac{1}{K}$.\n$$ M(M-1) = \\frac{D^2}{K} $$\nThis yields a quadratic equation for $M$: $M^2 - M - \\frac{D^2}{K} = 0$.

The voltage conversion ratio in DCM is therefore:\n$$ M_{DCM}(D, K) = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{1+\\frac{4D^2}{K}}}{2} $$\nFinally, we determine the boundary condition $K_b(D)$ that separates CCM and DCM. This boundary occurs when the operating conditions are such that the minimum inductor current is precisely zero. This is the point where the behavior transitions from CCM to DCM. We can find this condition by equating the voltage conversion ratios for the two modes, as at the boundary, both expressions must yield the same result. The value of $K$ at this boundary is denoted $K_b(D)$.\n$$ M_{CCM}(D) = M_{DCM}(D, K_b(D)) $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{1-D} = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{1+\\frac{4D^2}{K_b(D)}}}{2} $$\nWe now solve for $K_b(D)$:\n$$ \\frac{2}{1-D} - 1 = \\sqrt{1+\\frac{4D^2}{K_b(D)}} $$\n$$ \\frac{2 - (1-D)}{1-D} = \\frac{1+D}{1-D} = \\sqrt{1+\\frac{4D^2}{K_b(D)}} $$\nSquaring both sides of the equation:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{1+D}{1-D} \\right)^2 = 1+\\frac{4D^2}{K_b(D)} $$\n$$ \\frac{(1+D)^2}{(1-D)^2} - 1 = \\frac{4D^2}{K_b(D)} $$\n$$ \\frac{(1+2D+D^2) - (1-2D+D^2)}{(1-D)^2} = \\frac{4D^2}{K_b(D)} $$\n$$ \\frac{4D}{(1-D)^2} = \\frac{4D^2}{K_b(D)} $$\nFor the domain of interest $D \\in (0,1)$, we can divide both sides by $4D$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{(1-D)^2} = \\frac{D}{K_b(D)} $$\nSolving for $K_b(D)$ gives the final expression for the boundary condition:\n$$ K_b(D) = D(1-D)^2 $$\nFor a given duty cycle $D$, if the normalized load parameter $K > K_b(D)$, the converter operates in CCM. If $K  K_b(D)$, it operates in DCM.",
