It describes a standard circuit from power electronics, the ideal boost converter, and asks for fundamental operating parameters. The provided values are self-consistent ($V_o > V_{in}$ is a requirement for a boost converter) and sufficient for a unique solution. The assumptions of ideal components and steady-state CCM operation are standard for a first-principles analysis. The problem is formal, complete, and does not violate any physical laws within its idealized framework.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived from first principles.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis proceeds by applying fundamental principles of circuit theory to the two distinct operating states of the boost converter during one switching period, $T_s$. The duty ratio, $D$, represents the fraction of the period for which the main switch is closed (ON).\n\n**1. Derivation of the Duty Ratio, $D$**\n\nThe derivation of the voltage conversion ratio relies on the principle of inductor volt-second balance. In steady-state operation, the time-average voltage across the inductor over one complete switching period must be zero.\n$$\n\\langle v_L \\rangle = \\frac{1}{T_s} \\int_{0}^{T_s} v_L(t) \\, dt = 0\n$$\n\nThe switching period $T_s$ is divided into two intervals:\n- **Interval 1: $0 \\le t < DT_s$ (Switch ON)**\n  When the switch is ON, it provides a low-resistance path to ground. The input voltage source $V_{in}$ is applied directly across the ideal inductor $L$. The diode is reverse-biased by the output voltage $V_o$.\n  $$\n  v_L(t) = V_{in}\n  $$\n- **Interval 2: $DT_s \\le t < T_s$ (Switch OFF)**\n  When the switch is OFF, the inductor current continues to flow, forcing the diode to become forward-biased. Applying Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) to the loop containing the source, inductor, diode, and output yields:\n  $$\n  -V_{in} + v_L(t) + V_o = 0\n  $$\n  Since the diode is ideal, its forward voltage drop is zero. Therefore, the voltage across the inductor is:\n  $$\n  v_L(t) = V_{in} - V_o\n  $$\n\nApplying the volt-second balance principle:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{T_s} v_L(t) \\, dt = \\int_{0}^{DT_s} V_{in} \\, dt + \\int_{DT_s}^{T_s} (V_{in} - V_o) \\, dt = 0\n$$\n$$\n(V_{in})(DT_s) + (V_{in} - V_o)(T_s - DT_s) = 0\n$$\nSince $T_s \\neq 0$, we can divide the equation by $T_s$:\n$$\nV_{in}D + (V_{in} - V_o)(1 - D) = 0\n$$\n$$\nV_{in}D + V_{in} - V_{in}D - V_o + V_o D = 0\n$$\n$$\nV_{in} - V_o + V_o D = 0\n$$\nSolving for the duty ratio $D$:\n$$\nV_o D = V_o - V_{in}\n$$\n$$\nD = \\frac{V_o - V_{in}}{V_o} = 1 - \\frac{V_{in}}{V_o}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values $V_{in} = 48~\\mathrm{V}$ and $V_{o} = 200~\\mathrm{V}$:\n$$\nD = 1 - \\frac{48}{200} = 1 - \\frac{12}{50} = 1 - \\frac{6}{25} = \\frac{25-6}{25} = \\frac{19}{25}\n$$\n\n**2. Derivation of the Average Inductor Current, $I_L$**\n\nThe average inductor current $I_L$ is determined from the principle of conservation of energy. Since the converter is stated to be ideal, there are no power losses. Therefore, the input power $P_{in}$ must equal the output power $P_o$.\n$$\nP_{in} = P_o\n$$\nThe input power is the product of the average input voltage and the average input current: $P_{in} = V_{in} I_{in}$. In the boost converter topology, the inductor is in series with the input source, so the average input current is identical to the average inductor current, $I_{in} = I_L$.\n$$\nP_{in} = V_{in} I_L\n$$\nThe output power is dissipated by the resistive load $R$. Given a constant output voltage $V_o$ (due to the large capacitor), the output power is:\n$$\nP_o = \\frac{V_o^2}{R}\n$$\nEquating input and output power:\n$$\nV_{in} I_L = \\frac{V_o^2}{R}\n$$\nSolving for the average inductor current $I_L$:\n$$\nI_L = \\frac{V_o^2}{R V_{in}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values $V_{in} = 48~\\mathrm{V}$, $V_{o} = 200~\\mathrm{V}$, and $R = 500~\\Omega$:\n$$\nI_L = \\frac{(200)^2}{(500)(48)} = \\frac{40000}{24000} = \\frac{40}{24}\n$$\nSimplifying the fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $8$:\n$$\nI_L = \\frac{5 \\times 8}{3 \\times 8} = \\frac{5}{3}~\\mathrm{A}\n$$\nThe ordered pair $\\left(D, I_{L}\\right)$ is therefore $\\left(\\frac{19}{25}, \\frac{5}{3}\\right)$.",

It is a standard textbook problem. The problem is well-posed; it provides sufficient information to derive a unique expression for the requested quantity. The language is objective and precise. The conditions, such as ideal components and operation in DCM, are clearly stated and form a consistent set of assumptions for analysis. The problem is not unsound, incomplete, contradictory, or ill-posed.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from the first principles stipulated in the problem statement. The switching period $T_s$ is divided into three distinct subintervals under DCM operation.\n\n1.  **Interval 1: Switch is ON ($0 < t \\leq DT_s$)**\n    The ideal switch is closed, and the ideal diode is reverse-biased and off. The inductor is connected directly across the input voltage source $V_g$. The voltage across the inductor is therefore $v_L(t) = V_g$. According to the inductor's constitutive law, $v_L = L \\frac{di_L}{dt}$, the inductor current $i_L(t)$ increases linearly. Starting from $i_L(0)=0$ (the condition for the start of the period in DCM), the current at the end of this interval reaches its peak value, $i_{L,pk}$.\n    $$ \\frac{di_L}{dt} = \\frac{V_g}{L} $$\n    $$ i_{L,pk} = i_L(DT_s) = \\frac{V_g}{L} (DT_s) = \\frac{V_g D T_s}{L} $$\n\n2.  **Interval 2: Switch is OFF, Diode is ON ($DT_s < t \\leq (D+D_2)T_s$)**\n    The switch opens, and the inductor current, which cannot change instantaneously, forward-biases the diode. The inductor is now connected between the input source and the output. The voltage across the inductor is $v_L(t) = V_g - V_o$. Since for a boost converter $V_o > V_g$, this voltage is negative, causing the inductor current to decrease linearly. The interval ends when the inductor current reaches zero at time $t = (D+D_2)T_s$. The duration of this second interval is $D_2 T_s$.\n    $$ \\frac{di_L}{dt} = \\frac{V_g - V_o}{L} $$\n    The change in current during this interval is from $i_{L,pk}$ to $0$:\n    $$ \\Delta i_L = 0 - i_{L,pk} = \\frac{V_g - V_o}{L} (D_2 T_s) $$\n    $$ i_{L,pk} = -\\frac{V_g - V_o}{L} D_2 T_s = \\frac{V_o - V_g}{L} D_2 T_s $$\n\n3.  **Interval 3: Switch is OFF, Diode is OFF ($(D+D_2)T_s < t \\leq T_s$)**\n    Once the inductor current reaches zero, the diode turns off as there is no current to maintain it in conduction. The inductor current remains at zero for the rest of the switching period. The defining characteristic of DCM is that this interval has a non-zero duration, which implies $D + D_2 < 1$.\n\nNow, we will use these relationships to derive the expression for the duty ratio $D$. The analysis relies on two fundamental principles for steady-state operation: inductor volt-second balance and output node charge balance.\n\nFirst, by equating the two expressions derived for the peak inductor current $i_{L,pk}$:\n$$ \\frac{V_g D T_s}{L} = \\frac{(V_o - V_g) D_2 T_s}{L} $$\n$$ V_g D = (V_o - V_g) D_2 $$\nThis equation also represents the inductor volt-second balance principle, where the net change in inductor flux over one period is zero. This gives us a relationship for $D_2$:\n$$ D_2 = D \\frac{V_g}{V_o - V_g} $$\n\nSecond, we apply the principle of conservation of charge at the output node. In steady state, the average current supplied to the output node must equal the average current drawn by the load. The load current is constant: $I_o = V_o / R$. The current supplied to the output is the diode current, $i_D(t)$. This current is non-zero only during the second interval, where it is equal to the inductor current, $i_L(t)$. The waveform of $i_D(t)$ over one period is thus a triangular pulse of height $i_{L,pk}$ and duration $D_2 T_s$. The average diode current $\\langle i_D \\rangle$ is the area of this triangle divided by the period $T_s$.\n$$ \\langle i_D \\rangle = \\frac{1}{T_s} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\text{base} \\cdot \\text{height} \\right) = \\frac{1}{T_s} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} (D_2 T_s) i_{L,pk} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} D_2 i_{L,pk} $$\nSetting the average diode current equal to the average load current:\n$$ \\frac{V_o}{R} = \\frac{1}{2} D_2 i_{L,pk} $$\n\nWe now have a system of equations to solve for $D$, designated as $D^{\\star}$ for the specific operating point. We substitute the expressions for $D_2$ and $i_{L,pk}$ into the charge balance equation:\n$$ \\frac{V_o}{R} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( D \\frac{V_g}{V_o - V_g} \\right) \\left( \\frac{V_g D T_s}{L} \\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{V_o}{R} = \\frac{D^2 V_g^2 T_s}{2L(V_o - V_g)} $$\nSolving for $D^2$:\n$$ D^2 = \\frac{2 L V_o (V_o - V_g)}{R V_g^2 T_s} $$\nSubstituting $T_s = 1/f_s$ and solving for $D = D^{\\star}$:\n$$ (D^{\\star})^2 = \\frac{2 L f_s V_o (V_o - V_g)}{R V_g^2} $$\nSince the duty ratio must be positive, we take the positive square root:\n$$ D^{\\star} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 L f_s V_o (V_o - V_g)}{R V_g^2}} $$\nThis expression gives the required duty ratio $D^{\\star}$ to achieve the output voltage $V_o$ under DCM operation, given the circuit parameters.\n\nNext, we analyze the behavior of $D^{\\star}$ with respect to the load resistance $R$. The expression for $D^{\\star}$ can be written as:\n$$ D^{\\star} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 L f_s V_o (V_o - V_g)}{V_g^2}} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{R}} $$\nAll parameters $V_o$, $V_g$, $L$, and $f_s$ are held fixed. Since $V_o > V_g$, the term under the square root is a positive constant. Let this constant be $C$:\n$$ C = \\frac{2 L f_s V_o (V_o - V_g)}{V_g^2} > 0 $$\nThen, $D^{\\star} = \\sqrt{C/R}$. As the load resistance $R$ increases (representing a lighter load), the denominator of the fraction increases, causing the value of $C/R$ to decrease. Consequently, $D^{\\star}$ decreases as $R$ increases. This means that to maintain a constant output voltage, a lighter load requires a smaller duty ratio in DCM.\n\nFinally, we determine the sign of the small-signal sensitivity $\\partial D^{\\star}/\\partial R$. We differentiate the expression for $D^{\\star}$ with respect to $R$:\n$$ D^{\\star} = \\sqrt{C} R^{-1/2} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial D^{\\star}}{\\partial R} = \\sqrt{C} \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} R^{-3/2} \\right) = -\\frac{\\sqrt{C}}{2R\\sqrt{R}} $$\nSince $C > 0$ and $R > 0$, the term $\\sqrt{C}$ is real and positive, and $2R\\sqrt{R}$ is also positive. Therefore, the entire expression for the derivative is negative.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial D^{\\star}}{\\partial R} < 0 $$\nThe sign of the small-signal sensitivity is negative, which confirms the qualitative observation that $D^{\\star}$ is a decreasing function of $R$.",

The output node voltage across the capacitor terminals is\n$$\nv_{o}(t) = v_{C}(t) + r_{c}\\,i_{C}(t).\n$$\nBecause $i_{C}(t)$ changes discontinuously at the switching instants, $r_{c} i_{C}(t)$ produces instantaneous jumps in $v_{o}(t)$ at $t = D T_{s}$ and $t = T_{s}$, while $v_{C}(t)$ is continuous.\n\nWe evaluate $v_{o}(t)$ at the key instants and find the extrema:\n\n- At $t = 0^{+}$ (just after the switch turns on): $i_{C} = -\\,i_{o}$, so\n$$\nv_{o}(0^{+}) = v_{C}(0) + r_{c}(-\\,i_{o}) = v_{C}(0) - 0.05 \\times 3.\\overline{3} = v_{C}(0) - \\frac{1}{6}.\n$$\n\n- At $t = D T_{s}^{-}$ (end of on-interval, just before the diode turns on): $v_{C}$ has decreased by $2/33~\\mathrm{V}$ and $i_{C} = -\\,i_{o}$,\n$$\nv_{o}(D T_{s}^{-}) = v_{C}(0) - \\frac{2}{33} - \\frac{1}{6} = v_{C}(0) - \\frac{5}{22}.\n$$\n\n- At $t = D T_{s}^{+}$ (start of off-interval, just after diode turns on): $v_{C}$ is unchanged from $D T_{s}^{-}$, but $i_{C}$ jumps to $I_{\\mathrm{pk}} - i_{o} = 6.\\overline{5} - 3.\\overline{3} = 3.\\overline{2}$,\n$$\nv_{o}(D T_{s}^{+}) = \\left(v_{C}(0) - \\frac{2}{33}\\right) + 0.05 \\times 3.\\overline{2} = v_{C}(0) - \\frac{2}{33} + \\frac{29}{180} = v_{C}(0) + \\frac{199}{1980}.\n$$\n\n- At $t = T_{s}^{-}$ (end of off-interval, just before next switch turn-on): $v_{C}$ has returned to $v_{C}(0)$, and $i_{C} = I_{\\mathrm{min}} - i_{o} = 4.\\overline{5} - 3.\\overline{3} = 1.\\overline{2}$,\n$$\nv_{o}(T_{s}^{-}) = v_{C}(0) + 0.05 \\times 1.\\overline{2} = v_{C}(0) + \\frac{11}{180}.\n$$\n\nTo confirm interior extrema during intervals, we examine the derivative\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{o}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{i_{C}(t)}{C} + r_{c}\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{d}i_{C}}{\\mathrm{d}t}.\n$$\nOn the on-interval, $\\mathrm{d}i_{C}/\\mathrm{d}t = 0$ and $i_{C} = -\\,i_{o}$, so $\\mathrm{d}v_{o}/\\mathrm{d}t = -\\,i_{o}/C  0$; $v_{o}(t)$ decreases monotonically. On the off-interval, $i_{C}(t)$ is linearly decreasing while $\\mathrm{d}i_{C}/\\mathrm{d}t$ is a negative constant; with the given parameters, $\\mathrm{d}v_{o}/\\mathrm{d}t$ is negative throughout the off-interval (initially $\\mathrm{d}v_{o}/\\mathrm{d}t = (I_{\\mathrm{pk}} - i_{o})/C - r_{c} \\Delta I_{L}/T_{\\mathrm{off}}  0$), so $v_{o}(t)$ also decreases monotonically during the off-interval. Therefore, extrema occur at the boundaries due to the ESR-induced jumps.\n\nThe maximum and minimum over the cycle are thus\n$$\nv_{\\max} = v_{o}(D T_{s}^{+}) = v_{C}(0) + \\frac{199}{1980}, \\quad\nv_{\\min} = v_{o}(D T_{s}^{-}) = v_{C}(0) - \\frac{5}{22}.\n$$\nThe peak-to-peak ripple is\n$$\n\\Delta v_{o} = v_{\\max} - v_{\\min} = \\left(v_{C}(0) + \\frac{199}{1980}\\right) - \\left(v_{C}(0) - \\frac{5}{22}\\right) = \\frac{199}{1980} + \\frac{5}{22}.\n$$\nSimplifying,\n$$\n\\frac{199}{1980} + \\frac{5}{22} = \\frac{199}{1980} + \\frac{450}{1980} = \\frac{649}{1980} = \\frac{59}{180}.\n$$\n\nThus, the peak-to-peak output capacitor voltage ripple is\n$$\n\\Delta v_{o} = \\frac{59}{180}~\\mathrm{V} \\approx 0.327777\\ldots~\\mathrm{V}.\n$$\nRounded to four significant figures and expressed in volts, $\\Delta v_{o} = 0.3278~\\mathrm{V}$.",
