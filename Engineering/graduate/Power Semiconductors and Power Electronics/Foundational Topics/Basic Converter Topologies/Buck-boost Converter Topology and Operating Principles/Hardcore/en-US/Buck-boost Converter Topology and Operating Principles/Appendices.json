            "problem": "A single-inductor, single-capacitor, inverting buck-boost direct current to direct current power stage operates with an ideal pulse-width modulation (PWM) switch and an ideal diode, an ideal inductor of inductance $L$, and an ideal capacitor of capacitance $C$, supplying an ideal resistive load of resistance $R$ from an ideal source of voltage $V_{g}$. The PWM duty ratio is $D$, and the switching frequency is $f_{s}$. Assume the converter operates in continuous conduction mode (CCM), the ripple in the output voltage is sufficiently small that the resistive load current may be treated as quasi-constant over each subinterval, and all semiconductor devices and passive components are ideal (no conduction drops, no parasitics, zero equivalent series resistance).

            "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is a standard exercise in power electronics analysis, scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains a self-consistent set of parameters for operation in continuous conduction mode (CCM), as confirmed by preliminary calculations. All components are defined as ideal, and the objective is clear and formalizable. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe analysis of the inverting buck-boost converter relies on the fundamental state-space equations for the inductor and the capacitor. The voltage across an inductor $L$ is related to the current $i_L$ flowing through it by $v_L(t) = L \\frac{di_L(t)}{dt}$. The current through a capacitor $C$ is related to the voltage $v_C$ across it by $i_C(t) = C \\frac{dv_C(t)}{dt}$. The output voltage $v_o$ is the voltage across the capacitor, $v_o(t) = v_C(t)$. The converter operates in two distinct states within one switching period $T_s = 1/f_s$.\n\nState 1: The switch is ON for a duration $D T_s$, where $D$ is the duty ratio. This interval corresponds to $t \\in [0, DT_s]$.\nDuring this state, the PWM switch is closed, and the diode is reverse-biased (since $V_o  0$). The inductor is connected directly to the input voltage source $V_g$. The voltage across the inductor is:\n$$v_L(t) = V_g$$\nThe capacitor is disconnected from the inductor-switch path and supplies current to the resistive load $R$. Assuming the output voltage ripple is small, the load current is approximately constant at $I_o = V_o/R$. The capacitor current is:\n$$i_C(t) = -I_o = -\\frac{V_o}{R}$$\n\nState 2: The switch is OFF for a duration $(1-D)T_s$. This interval corresponds to $t \\in (DT_s, T_s]$.\nDuring this state, the PWM switch is open. The inductor current, which cannot change instantaneously, forward-biases the diode. The inductor is connected to the output, placing the output voltage $V_o$ across it. The voltage across the inductor is:\n$$v_L(t) = V_o$$\nThe inductor current flows through the diode to both the capacitor and the load. The capacitor current is the inductor current minus the load current:\n$$i_C(t) = i_L(t) - I_o = i_L(t) - \\frac{V_o}{R}$$\n\nIn steady-state operation, two conditions must be met:\n1.  Inductor Volt-Second Balance: The net change in inductor current over one period must be zero. This implies that the time integral of the inductor voltage over one switching period is zero.\n2.  Capacitor Charge Balance: The net change in capacitor voltage over one period must be zero. This implies that the time integral of the capacitor current over one switching period is zero (i.e., the average capacitor current is zero).\n\nFrom the inductor volt-second balance:\n$$\\int_0^{T_s} v_L(t) dt = \\int_0^{DT_s} V_g dt + \\int_{DT_s}^{T_s} V_o dt = 0$$\n$$V_g(DT_s) + V_o((1-D)T_s) = 0$$\n$$V_g D + V_o (1-D) = 0$$\nThis yields the direct current (DC) voltage conversion ratio for the buck-boost converter:\n$$\\frac{V_o}{V_g} = -\\frac{D}{1-D}$$\n\nFirst, we compute the steady-state peak-to-peak inductor current ripple, $\\Delta i_L$. This ripple is the change in inductor current during either of the two subintervals. During the first subinterval (switch ON), the inductor current increases linearly. The total increase is:\n$$\\Delta i_L = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_0^{DT_s} v_L(t) dt = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_0^{DT_s} V_g dt = \\frac{V_g D T_s}{L}$$\nSince $T_s = 1/f_s$, the expression for the current ripple is:\n$$\\Delta i_L = \\frac{V_g D}{L f_s}$$\n\nNext, we compute the steady-state peak-to-peak output voltage ripple, $\\Delta v_o$. This ripple is caused by the charging and discharging of the output capacitor. The capacitor discharges during the first subinterval (switch ON) when it alone supplies the load current. The change in charge on the capacitor during this interval is $\\Delta Q$.\n$$\\Delta Q = \\int_0^{DT_s} i_C(t) dt = \\int_0^{DT_s} \\left(-\\frac{V_o}{R}\\right) dt = -\\frac{V_o D T_s}{R}$$\nThe peak-to-peak voltage ripple is the magnitude of the voltage change resulting from this change in charge:\n$$\\Delta v_o = \\left|\\frac{\\Delta Q}{C}\\right| = \\left|-\\frac{V_o D T_s}{R C}\\right| = \\frac{|V_o| D T_s}{R C}$$\nSubstituting $T_s = 1/f_s$, we get:\n$$\\Delta v_o = \\frac{|V_o| D}{R C f_s}$$\nWe must first calculate the DC output voltage $V_o$ using the given parameters.\n\nNow we substitute the numerical values:\n$L = 47\\,\\mu\\mathrm{H} = 47 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{H}$\n$C = 220\\,\\mu\\mathrm{F} = 220 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{F}$\n$V_g = 12\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n$D = 0.6$\n$R = 10\\,\\Omega$\n$f_s = 200\\,\\mathrm{kHz} = 200 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$\n\nCalculation of inductor current ripple $\\Delta i_L$:\n$$\\Delta i_L = \\frac{(12\\,\\mathrm{V}) \\times 0.6}{(47 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{H}) \\times (200 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{Hz})} = \\frac{7.2}{47 \\times 0.2} = \\frac{7.2}{9.4} \\approx 0.765957\\,\\mathrm{A}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the inductor current ripple is $\\Delta i_L = 0.7660\\,\\mathrm{A}$.\n\nCalculation of output voltage ripple $\\Delta v_o$:\nFirst, calculate the DC output voltage $V_o$.\n$$V_o = -V_g \\frac{D}{1-D} = -(12\\,\\mathrm{V}) \\frac{0.6}{1-0.6} = -12 \\times \\frac{0.6}{0.4} = -12 \\times 1.5 = -18\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nTherefore, $|V_o| = 18\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\nNow, calculate the voltage ripple:\n$$\\Delta v_o = \\frac{|V_o| D}{R C f_s} = \\frac{(18\\,\\mathrm{V}) \\times 0.6}{(10\\,\\Omega) \\times (220 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{F}) \\times (200 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{Hz})} = \\frac{10.8}{10 \\times 220 \\times 0.2} = \\frac{10.8}{440} \\approx 0.024545\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the output voltage ripple is $\\Delta v_o = 0.02455\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n\nThe calculated values are the peak-to-peak ripple for the inductor current and the output voltage, respectively.",

            "solution": "The inductor voltage-current relation is given by\n$$\nv_L(t) = L\\,\\frac{di_L(t)}{dt}.\n$$\nIn peak current-mode control with trailing-edge Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), the duty cycle is set by intersecting the sum of the sensed inductor current and an artificial ramp with a reference. Over one switching period $T_s = 1/f_s$, the inductor current increases with a constant slope during the switch-on interval and decreases with a constant slope during the switch-off interval, assuming an approximately constant input and output voltage over the switching cycle.\n\nFor the inverting buck-boost converter:\n- During the switch-on interval (main switch closed, diode off), the inductor is connected to the input source, so the inductor voltage is\n$$\nv_L^{\\text{on}} = V_g.\n$$\nThus the inductor current upslope magnitude is\n$$\nm_1 = \\frac{di_L}{dt}\\bigg|_{\\text{on}} = \\frac{v_L^{\\text{on}}}{L} = \\frac{V_g}{L}.\n$$\n- During the switch-off interval (main switch open, diode on), the inductor discharges into the output node, imposing the output voltage across the inductor.

Geometric linearization of the intersection condition between the rising inductor current plus artificial ramp and the fixed threshold yields a one-dimensional affine map. The slope (eigenvalue) of this map depends on the relative magnitudes of the natural upslope $m_1$, natural downslope $m_2$, and the added artificial ramp slope $m_a$.\n\nA standard derivation proceeds by noting that a perturbation in the peak current changes the on-time in the next cycle through the comparator intersection condition. Accounting for the artificial ramp, the effective rising slope becomes $m_1 + m_a$ and the effective falling slope becomes $m_2 - m_a$ when referred to the sensed signal.

It provides all necessary parameters to determine the minimum required dead-time for a half-bridge leg in a synchronous converter.\n\nThe primary objective is to calculate the minimum dead-time, $t_{\\text{dead,min}}$, required to prevent shoot-through. Shoot-through occurs if the incoming MOSFET is commanded to turn on before the outgoing MOSFET has fully turned off and the voltage at the switching node has transitioned to a safe level. The problem explicitly requires that the dead-time calculation account for three distinct phenomena:\n1.  The time for the outgoing MOSFET to cease channel conduction.\n2.  The time for the midpoint (switching) node to complete its voltage transition.\n3.  The propagation delay skew between the gate driver channels.\n\nA conservative and direct interpretation of the problem's instructions is to model these events as sequential and sum their durations to find the total minimum dead-time. We will proceed with this methodology. The scenario under consideration is the turn-off of the high-side MOSFET in a half-bridge leg connected to an inductor carrying a current of $I_L = 20\\,\\text{A}$.\n\n**1. Time for the Outgoing Device to Cease Conduction ($t_{\\text{turn-off}}$)**\nThis is the time elapsed from the turn-off command at the gate until the MOSFET channel is no longer conducting. The problem provides two parameters that constitute this period:\n- The turn-off delay time, $t_{d,\\text{off}} = 18\\,\\text{ns}$. This is the latency between the gate command going low and the drain current beginning to fall.\n- The fall time, $t_f = 22\\,\\text{ns}$. This is the duration over which the drain current decays to a near-zero value.\n\nThe total time for the channel to cease conduction is the sum of these two intervals:\n$$t_{\\text{turn-off}} = t_{d,\\text{off}} + t_f = 18\\,\\text{ns} + 22\\,\\text{ns} = 40\\,\\text{ns}$$\n\n**2. Midpoint Node Voltage Transition Time ($t_{\\text{slew}}$)**\nAfter the high-side MOSFET channel turns off, the constant inductor current, $I_L = 20\\,\\text{A}$, is no longer sourced from the input rail through the channel. Instead, this current commutates to the parasitic output capacitances of the half-bridge, causing the switching node voltage to slew from $V_{\\text{in}}$ towards ground. The problem instructs to estimate this time using a charge balance.\nThe total charge that must be moved, $Q_{\\text{oss,total}}$, is specified as the sum of the output charges of the two identical MOSFETs in the leg:\n$$Q_{\\text{oss,total}} = Q_{\\text{oss,high}} + Q_{\\text{oss,low}} = 60\\,\\text{nC} + 60\\,\\text{nC} = 120\\,\\text{nC}$$\nThe relationship between charge ($Q$), constant current ($I$), and time ($t$) is $Q = I \\cdot t$. The current driving this transition is the inductor current, $I_L$. Therefore, the node voltage transition time, or slew time, is:\n$$t_{\\text{slew}} = \\frac{Q_{\\text{oss,total}}}{I_L} = \\frac{120\\,\\text{nC}}{20\\,\\text{A}} = \\frac{120 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{C}}{20\\,\\text{A}} = 6 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{s} = 6\\,\\text{ns}$$\nThis calculation assumes the full inductor current is available for slewing the node, which is consistent with the sequential model where this process begins after the channel current has fallen to zero.\n\n**3. Driver Propagation Skew ($t_{\\text{skew}}$)**\nThe driver propagation skew, $t_{\\text{skew}} = 4\\,\\text{ns}$, represents the worst-case timing difference between the high-side and low-side driver outputs. To guarantee that shoot-through is prevented under all conditions, this skew must be added to the calculated dead-time as a safety margin. It ensures that even if the turn-off signal is delayed and the turn-on signal is advanced by the maximum skew, the effective dead-time is still sufficient.\n\n**4. Minimum Dead-Time Calculation**\nThe minimum total dead-time is the sum of the durations of these sequential events and the safety margin:\n$$t_{\\text{dead,min}} = t_{\\text{turn-off}} + t_{\\text{slew}} + t_{\\text{skew}}$$\n$$t_{\\text{dead,min}} = 40\\,\\text{ns} + 6\\,\\text{ns} + 4\\,\\text{ns} = 50\\,\\text{ns}$$\n\n**5. Verification of Miller Turn-On Constraint**\nThe problem requires an additional check to ensure that the low-side MOSFET (which is off) is not parasitically turned on by the rapid change in its drain-source voltage during the node transition. This is known as the Miller effect.\nThe changing voltage at the switching node, $\\mathrm{d}v_{sw}/\\mathrm{d}t$, induces a current $i_{\\text{Miller}}$ through the low-side MOSFET's reverse transfer capacitance, $C_{\\text{rss}}$.\n$$i_{\\text{Miller}} = C_{\\text{rss}} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{sw}}{\\mathrm{d}t}$$\nThis current flows through the equivalent resistance of the gate turn-off path, $R_{\\text{eq}} = 2.5\\,\\Omega$, generating a transient voltage rise at the gate, $v_{gs, \\text{bump}}$.\n$$v_{gs, \\text{bump}} = i_{\\text{Miller}} \\cdot R_{\\text{eq}} = C_{\\text{rss}} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{sw}}{\\mathrm{d}t} R_{\\text{eq}}$$\nTo avoid parasitic turn-on, this voltage bump must remain strictly below the gate-source threshold voltage, $V_{\\text{th}} = 3.5\\,\\text{V}$.\nWe approximate the slew rate using the total voltage swing $\\Delta V = V_{\\text{in}} = 48\\,\\text{V}$ and the calculated slew time $t_{\\text{slew}} = 6\\,\\text{ns}$:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{sw}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta V}{t_{\\text{slew}}} = \\frac{48\\,\\text{V}}{6\\,\\text{ns}} = 8 \\times 10^9\\,\\frac{\\text{V}}{\\text{s}}$$\nThe magnitude of the induced gate voltage bump is:\n$$v_{gs, \\text{bump}} = (100\\,\\text{pF}) \\cdot \\left(8 \\times 10^9\\,\\frac{\\text{V}}{\\text{s}}\\right) \\cdot (2.5\\,\\Omega)$$\n$$v_{gs, \\text{bump}} = (100 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\text{F}) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^9\\,\\text{s}^{-1}) \\cdot (2.5\\,\\Omega) = 2.0\\,\\text{V}$$\nComparing this to the threshold voltage:\n$$2.0\\,\\text{V}  V_{\\text{th}} = 3.5\\,\\text{V}$$\nThe condition is satisfied. The calculated dead-time of $50\\,\\text{ns}$ results in a slew rate that does not cause parasitic Miller turn-on.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n- **A. $t_{\\text{dead}} \\approx 32\\,\\text{ns}$**: This value is likely obtained by an incorrect calculation, such as $t_f + t_{\\text{slew}} + t_{\\text{skew}} = 22\\,\\text{ns} + 6\\,\\text{ns} + 4\\,\\text{ns} = 32\\,\\text{ns}$. This formula erroneously omits the turn-off delay time $t_{d,\\text{off}} = 18\\,\\text{ns}$, which is a critical part of the turn-off sequence. A dead-time of $32\\,\\text{ns}$ is insufficient. **Incorrect**.\n\n- **B. $t_{\\text{dead}} \\approx 50\\,\\text{ns}$**: This value matches our derived minimum dead-time, $t_{\\text{dead,min}} = 50\\,\\text{ns}$. This result is obtained by logically summing the time required for the outgoing device to turn off ($t_{d,\\text{off}} + t_f = 40\\,\\text{ns}$), the time for the node to slew ($t_{\\text{slew}} = 6\\,\\text{ns}$), and a safety margin for driver skew ($t_{\\text{skew}} = 4\\,\\text{ns}$). This approach is fully consistent with the problem statement's requirements and physical principles. **Correct**.\n\n- **C. $t_{\\text{dead}} \\approx 72\\,\\text{ns}$**: While a dead-time of $72\\,\\text{ns}$ would safely prevent shoot-through (as it is greater than the calculated minimum of $50\\,\\text{ns}$), it is not the *minimum* required dead-time. Such a long dead-time would unnecessarily increase body diode conduction losses and reduce converter efficiency. The question asks for the minimum time that satisfies the constraints. **Incorrect**.\n\n- **D. $t_{\\text{dead}} \\approx 6\\,\\text{ns}$**: This value is equal only to the node slew time, $t_{\\text{slew}}$. It completely neglects the MOSFET's inherent turn-off delay and fall time ($40\\,\\text{ns}$ total) and the driver skew ($4\\,\\text{ns}$). Implementing this dead-time would lead to catastrophic shoot-through. **Incorrect**.",
