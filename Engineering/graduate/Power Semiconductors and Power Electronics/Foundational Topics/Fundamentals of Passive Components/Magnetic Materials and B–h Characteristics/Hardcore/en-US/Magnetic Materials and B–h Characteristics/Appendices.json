            "problem": "A toroidal magnetic core is characterized using a laboratory hysteresisgraph arrangement designed for power electronics materials evaluation. The toroid has mean magnetic path length $l_{m}$, uniform cross-sectional area $A_{c}$, and exhibits negligible fringing and negligible interlaminar eddy currents at the test frequency. A drive winding of $N_{p}$ turns is excited by a sinusoidal current produced by a voltage source feeding the winding in series with a non-inductive shunt resistor of resistance $R_{\\text{sh}}$. A second, separate sense winding of $N_{s}$ turns is wound on the same core and left open-circuited, with its differential voltage measured by a high-impedance probe on a Digital Storage Oscilloscope (DSO). The shunt resistor voltage is also measured. Assume the sense winding draws negligible current.\n\nThe arrangement is operated at frequency $f$, with angular frequency $\\omega = 2\\pi f$, and the following measurement data are recorded for the steady-state sinusoidal regime:\n- Core geometry: $l_{m} = 0.10$ m, $A_{c} = 1.20 \\times 10^{-4}$ m$^{2}$.\n- Windings: $N_{p} = 100$, $N_{s} = 50$.\n- Shunt resistor: $R_{\\text{sh}} = 0.50$ $\\Omega$.\n- Measured shunt voltage: $v_{\\text{sh}}(t) = 0.050 \\sin(\\omega t)$ V.\n- Measured sense voltage: $v_{s}(t) = 3.7699 \\cos(\\omega t)$ V.\n- Test frequency: $f = 1000$ Hz, so $\\omega = 2\\pi \\times 1000$ rad/s.\n\nStarting from fundamental laws and core definitions only, specifically Ampere's circuital law for magnetostatics and Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, and assuming spatially uniform magnetic field intensity $H(t)$ over the mean path and spatially uniform magnetic flux density $B(t)$ over the cross-section, derive expressions for $H(t)$ and $B(t)$ in terms of the measured signals.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is well-posed, scientifically grounded in the principles of electromagnetism, and provides a complete and consistent set of data for analysis. We can proceed with the solution.\n\nThe task is to derive expressions for the magnetic field intensity $H(t)$ and magnetic flux density $B(t)$ from the provided measurements, calculate their peak values $H_{\\text{pk}}$ and $B_{\\text{pk}}$, and finally compute the dynamic ratio $\\mu_{\\text{dyn}} = B_{\\text{pk}} / H_{\\text{pk}}$.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the magnetic field intensity $H(t)$. We start from Ampere's circuital law, which in its integral form is given by:\n$$\n\\oint \\mathbf{H} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l} = I_{\\text{enc}}\n$$\nFor the toroidal core, we take the integration path to be the mean magnetic path length $l_m$. The problem states that $H(t)$ is spatially uniform along this path. The enclosed current, $I_{\\text{enc}}$, is the total current flowing through the area bounded by the path. This is the current in the primary winding, $i_p(t)$, multiplied by the number of turns $N_p$. Therefore, $I_{\\text{enc}} = N_p i_p(t)$. Ampere's law simplifies to:\n$$\nH(t) l_m = N_p i_p(t)\n$$\nSolving for $H(t)$ gives:\n$$\nH(t) = \\frac{N_p}{l_m} i_p(t)\n$$\nThe primary current $i_p(t)$ is not measured directly but is determined from the voltage $v_{\\text{sh}}(t)$ across the non-inductive shunt resistor of resistance $R_{\\text{sh}}$. According to Ohm's law:\n$$\ni_p(t) = \\frac{v_{\\text{sh}}(t)}{R_{\\text{sh}}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $H(t)$:\n$$\nH(t) = \\frac{N_p}{l_m R_{\\text{sh}}} v_{\\text{sh}}(t)\n$$\nThe problem provides the measured shunt voltage as $v_{\\text{sh}}(t) = 0.050 \\sin(\\omega t)$ V. Let's denote the peak shunt voltage as $V_{\\text{sh,pk}} = 0.050$ V. The expression for $H(t)$ becomes:\n$$\nH(t) = \\frac{N_p V_{\\text{sh,pk}}}{l_m R_{\\text{sh}}} \\sin(\\omega t)\n$$\nThe peak magnetic field intensity, $H_{\\text{pk}}$, is the amplitude of this sinusoidal function:\n$$\nH_{\\text{pk}} = \\frac{N_p V_{\\text{sh,pk}}}{l_m R_{\\text{sh}}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values: $N_p = 100$, $V_{\\text{sh,pk}} = 0.050$ V, $l_m = 0.10$ m, and $R_{\\text{sh}} = 0.50$ $\\Omega$.\n$$\nH_{\\text{pk}} = \\frac{100 \\cdot 0.050}{0.10 \\cdot 0.50} = \\frac{5}{0.05} = 100 \\, \\text{A/m}\n$$\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the magnetic flux density $B(t)$. We start from Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction. The voltage induced in the sense winding, $v_s(t)$, is given by the rate of change of magnetic flux $\\Phi(t)$ through the coil:\n$$\nv_s(t) = N_s \\frac{d\\Phi(t)}{dt}\n$$\nThe problem assumes the magnetic flux density $B(t)$ is spatially uniform over the core's cross-sectional area $A_c$. The total magnetic flux is thus $\\Phi(t) = B(t) A_c$. Substituting this into Faraday's law:\n$$\nv_s(t) = N_s \\frac{d(B(t)A_c)}{dt} = N_s A_c \\frac{dB(t)}{dt}\n$$\nTo find $B(t)$, we must integrate this equation with respect to time:\n$$\nB(t) = \\frac{1}{N_s A_c} \\int v_s(t) dt\n$$\nThe problem provides the measured sense voltage as $v_s(t) = 3.7699 \\cos(\\omega t)$ V. Let's denote the peak sense voltage as $V_{\\text{s,pk}} = 3.7699$ V.\n$$\nB(t) = \\frac{1}{N_s A_c} \\int V_{\\text{s,pk}} \\cos(\\omega t) dt = \\frac{V_{\\text{s,pk}}}{N_s A_c} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\omega} \\sin(\\omega t) \\right) + C\n$$\nThe constant of integration $C$ represents a DC bias in the magnetic flux density. For a symmetric AC excitation in steady state, this DC component is zero. Thus, we set $C=0$.\n$$\nB(t) = \\frac{V_{\\text{s,pk}}}{N_s A_c \\omega} \\sin(\\omega t)\n$$\nWe observe that both $H(t)$ and $B(t)$ are sinusoidal functions of time and are in phase with each other. This indicates that, under these specific test conditions, the material behaves as a linear, lossless medium, where $B(t) = \\mu H(t)$.\n\nThe peak magnetic flux density, $B_{\\text{pk}}$, is the amplitude of this sinusoidal function:\n$$\nB_{\\text{pk}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{s,pk}}}{N_s A_c \\omega}\n$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values: $V_{\\text{s,pk}} = 3.7699$ V, $N_s = 50$, $A_c = 1.20 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\text{m}^2$, and $\\omega = 2\\pi f = 2\\pi \\cdot 1000$ rad/s.\n$$\nB_{\\text{pk}} = \\frac{3.7699}{50 \\cdot (1.20 \\times 10^{-4}) \\cdot (2\\pi \\cdot 1000)} = \\frac{3.7699}{50 \\cdot (1.20 \\times 10^{-4}) \\cdot 2000\\pi}\n$$\n$$\nB_{\\text{pk}} = \\frac{3.7699}{(6.0 \\times 10^{-3}) \\cdot 2000\\pi} = \\frac{3.7699}{12\\pi} \\, \\text{T}\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the dynamic ratio $\\mu_{\\text{dyn}} = B_{\\text{pk}} / H_{\\text{pk}}$, which represents the amplitude permeability under these conditions.\n$$\n\\mu_{\\text{dyn}} = \\frac{B_{\\text{pk}}}{H_{\\text{pk}}} = \\frac{\\left( \\dfrac{3.7699}{12\\pi} \\right)}{100} = \\frac{3.7699}{1200\\pi} \\, \\text{H/m}\n$$\nNow we compute the numerical value:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\text{dyn}} = \\frac{3.7699}{1200\\pi} \\approx \\frac{3.7699}{3769.911...} \\approx 0.0009999974... \\, \\text{H/m}\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\mu_{\\text{dyn}} \\approx 1.000 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{H/m}\n$$",

In the provided model, the permeability in the linear region is $\\mu_{\\text{lin}} \\mu_{0} = (5.0 \\times 10^{3}) \\mu_{0}$, whereas the *incremental* permeability in the saturation region ($dB/dH$) is just $\\mu_0$. This is a reduction by a factor of $\\mu_{\\text{lin}} = 5000$.\n\nThis dramatic change has profound implications for the magnetizing current. Let's calculate the current $I_{\\text{knee}}$ required to reach the onset of saturation at $B = B_{\\text{knee}}$:\n$$I_{\\text{knee}} = \\frac{H_{\\text{knee}} l}{N} = \\frac{(600/\\pi) \\times (1.80 \\times 10^{-1})}{120} = \\frac{0.9}{\\pi} \\approx 0.2865 \\, \\text{A}$$\nTo increase the flux density from $B=0$ to $B_{\\text{knee}}=1.20\\ \\text{T}$, a current of only approximately $0.29 \\, \\text{A}$ is required.\n\nIn contrast, to increase the flux density from $B_{\\text{knee}}=1.20\\ \\text{T}$ to $B_{\\text{pk}}=1.50\\ \\text{T}$ (an increase of only $0.30\\ \\text{T}$), the additional current required is:\n$$\\Delta I = I - I_{\\text{knee}} \\approx 358.4 - 0.2865 \\approx 358.1 \\, \\text{A}$$\nThis calculation starkly reveals the effect of saturation: a small increase in flux density ($0.30\\ \\text{T}$) beyond the knee point demands an enormous increase in magnetizing current (over $358\\ \\text{A}$), which is over $1200$ times the current needed to reach the knee point itself.\n\nFor a power electronic inductor, inductance $L$ is a critical parameter, defined as the ratio of flux linkage $\\lambda = N\\Phi = NBA$ to current $I$. More precisely, $L = d\\lambda/di$. Since $B$ is a function of $H$ and $H$ is directly proportional to $I$ ($H=NI/l$), the inductance is proportional to the slope of the B-H curve.\n- In the linear region, $L$ is high and relatively constant.\n- In the saturation region, the slope $dB/dH$ drops to $\\mu_0$, causing the incremental inductance to plummet by a factor of $\\mu_{\\text{lin}} = 5000$.\n\nThis collapse in inductance is highly dangerous in a switched-mode power converter. The inductor's primary function is to limit the rate of change of current ($di/dt = V/L$). If $L$ suddenly drops to a very small value, the current can rise uncontrollably to destructive levels, leading to catastrophic failure of a switching semiconductor (e.g., a MOSFET or IGBT) and other circuit components. Consequently, a fundamental principle of power inductor design is to ensure the core operates well below the knee of its B-H curve under all conditions, typically with a significant safety margin.",
