            "solution": "The primary task is to determine the donor concentration $N_{D}$ in the lightly doped $n$-region of a one-sided abrupt $p^{+}\\!-\\!n$ silicon diode using its measured small-signal AC admittance at two different reverse bias voltages.\n\n\\textbf{1. Derivation of Depletion Capacitance $C_{j}(V)$}\n\nWe begin by deriving the relationship between the junction depletion capacitance $C_{j}$ and the applied reverse bias voltage $V$. The derivation is based on the following physical assumptions:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item The junction is an ideal one-sided abrupt junction, meaning the acceptor concentration $N_{A}$ in the $p^{+}$ region is much greater than the donor concentration $N_{D}$ in the $n$ region ($N_{A} \\gg N_{D}$).\n    \\item The donor concentration $N_{D}$ is uniform throughout the $n$ region.\n    \\item The depletion approximation is valid. This implies that within the space-charge region (SCR), the mobile carrier concentrations are negligible compared to the ionized dopant concentrations, and the SCR boundaries are sharp.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nUnder these assumptions, the SCR extends almost entirely into the lightly doped $n$-side. Let the width of the SCR be $W$. From Poisson's equation, $\\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\rho(x)}{\\varepsilon_{s}}$, with space charge $\\rho(x) = q N_{D}$ in the SCR, we can integrate twice to find the total potential drop across the junction, which is the sum of the built-in potential $V_{bi}$ and the applied reverse bias $V$.\n$$ V_{bi} + V = \\frac{qN_{D}W^2}{2\\varepsilon_{s}} $$\nFrom this, we can express the depletion width $W$ as a function of the total voltage:\n$$ W(V) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\varepsilon_{s}(V_{bi}+V)}{qN_{D}}} $$\nThe total magnitude of the uncompensated charge in the SCR is $Q_{j} = A q N_{D} W$. The junction depletion capacitance $C_{j}$ is defined as the change in this charge with respect to the applied voltage $V$:\n$$ C_{j}(V) = \\left|\\frac{dQ_{j}}{dV}\\right| = \\frac{d}{dV} \\left( A q N_{D} \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\varepsilon_{s}(V_{bi}+V)}{qN_{D}}} \\right) = A \\sqrt{\\frac{q\\varepsilon_{s}N_{D}}{2(V_{bi}+V)}} $$\nThis is the desired expression. Rearranging this gives the parallel-plate capacitor formula $C_j = \\varepsilon_s A / W$.\n\n\\textbf{2. Extraction of Donor Concentration $N_{D}$}\n\nTo extract $N_{D}$ from experimental data, it is convenient to square and invert the expression for $C_{j}$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{C_{j}^2} = \\frac{2(V_{bi}+V)}{A^2 q \\varepsilon_{s} N_{D}} = \\left(\\frac{2}{A^2 q \\varepsilon_{s} N_{D}}\\right)V + \\frac{2V_{bi}}{A^2 q \\varepsilon_{s} N_{D}} $$\nThis equation shows that a plot of $1/C_{j}^2$ versus $V$ yields a straight line. The slope of this line is given by:\n$$ m = \\frac{d(1/C_{j}^2)}{dV} = \\frac{2}{A^2 q \\varepsilon_{s} N_{D}} $$\nBy measuring the capacitance at two different reverse biases, we can calculate this slope and then solve for $N_{D}$:\n$$ N_{D} = \\frac{2}{m A^2 q \\varepsilon_{s}} $$\n\n\\textbf{3. Measurement Considerations and Frequency Justification}\n\nThe measured small-signal susceptance $B$ is dominated by the junction capacitance, such that $B = \\omega C_{j}$, where $\\omega = 2\\pi f$ is the angular frequency. This gives $C_{j} = B/\\omega$. The chosen measurement frequency ($100\\,\\mathrm{kHz}$) is appropriate because it is high enough that the capacitive susceptance is much larger than the parallel conductance from leakage ($Q=B/G \\gg 1$), ensuring a high-fidelity capacitance measurement. It is also low enough to prevent deep-level traps from responding to the AC signal, which would corrupt the measurement of the shallow donor concentration.\n\n\\textbf{4. Calculation of $N_{D}$}\n\nThe measured data are:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item At $V_{1} = 20\\,\\mathrm{V}$, $B_{1} = 7.258\\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{S}$.\n    \\item At $V_{2} = 60\\,\\mathrm{V}$, $B_{2} = 4.246\\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{S}$.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe angular frequency is $\\omega = 2\\pi f = 2 \\pi (1.00 \\times 10^5\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})$.\nWe calculate the slope $m$ using the two data points:\n$$ m = \\frac{(1/C_{j2}^2) - (1/C_{j1}^2)}{V_2 - V_1} = \\frac{\\omega^2/B_{2}^2 - \\omega^2/B_{1}^2}{V_2 - V_1} = \\frac{\\omega^2(B_2^{-2} - B_1^{-2})}{V_2 - V_1} $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ B_1^{-2} = (7.258\\times 10^{-4})^{-2} \\approx 1.8982 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{S}^{-2} $$\n$$ B_2^{-2} = (4.246\\times 10^{-4})^{-2} \\approx 5.5493 \\times 10^6\\,\\mathrm{S}^{-2} $$\n$$ m = \\frac{(2\\pi \\times 1.00 \\times 10^5)^2 (5.5493 \\times 10^6 - 1.8982 \\times 10^6)}{60 - 20} \\approx \\frac{(3.9478 \\times 10^{11}) (3.6511 \\times 10^6)}{40} $$\n$$ m \\approx 3.6027 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{F}^{-2}\\mathrm{V}^{-1} $$\nNow we solve for $N_{D}$ using the constants:\n$A = 5.00 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}$\n$q = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n$\\varepsilon_{s} = 11.7 \\times \\varepsilon_{0} = 11.7 \\times (8.854187817 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}) \\approx 1.0359 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}$\n$$ N_{D} = \\frac{2}{m A^2 q \\varepsilon_{s}} $$\n$$ N_{D} = \\frac{2}{(3.6027 \\times 10^{16})(5.00 \\times 10^{-5})^2 (1.60217... \\times 10^{-19})(1.0359 \\times 10^{-10})} $$\n$$ N_{D} \\approx 1.3367 \\times 10^{21}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3} $$\nThe problem requests the answer in units of $\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. Since $1\\,\\mathrm{m} = 100\\,\\mathrm{cm}$, we have $1\\,\\mathrm{m}^3 = 10^6\\,\\mathrm{cm}^3$.\n$$ N_{D} = (1.3367 \\times 10^{21}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}) \\times (10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^3/cm^3}) = 1.3367 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $N_{D} = 1.34 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. This doping level is consistent with the \"lightly doped\" description for a power device's drift region.",
