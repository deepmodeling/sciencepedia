The datasheet specifies this occurs at $Q = 6.5\\,\\mathrm{nC}$. This is a very close match, confirming the first part of the waveform ($t \\in [0, 20\\,\\mathrm{ns}]$) is the pre-turn-on phase.\n- The second phase of charging ($Q_2 = 35\\,\\mathrm{nC}$) corresponds to the Miller plateau, where $V_{GS}$ is nearly constant while $V_{DS}$ falls. The datasheet specifies a charge of $\\Delta Q = 41.0\\,\\mathrm{nC} - 6.5\\,\\mathrm{nC} = 34.5\\,\\mathrm{nC}$ for this plateau. The measured value of $35\\,\\mathrm{nC}$ is in excellent agreement.\n- At the end of the Miller plateau (at $t=160\\,\\mathrm{ns}$), the total accumulated charge from measurement is $Q_{1}+Q_{2} \\approx 6.92 + 35 = 41.92\\,\\mathrm{nC}$. The datasheet specifies the plateau ends at $Q = 41.0\\,\\mathrm{nC}$, which again shows excellent consistency.\n- The final phase ($t  160\\,\\mathrm{ns}$) is the charging of the gate towards the final drive voltage of $8\\,\\mathrm{V}$. According to the datasheet, for $Q \\ge 41.0\\,\\mathrm{nC}$, the gate-source voltage increases as $V_{GS}(Q) = V_{GS,pl} + (dV_{GS}/dQ) \\times (Q - 41.0\\,\\mathrm{nC})$, where $V_{GS,pl} = 4.2\\,\\mathrm{V}$. At the total calculated charge $Q_g \\approx 43.82\\,\\mathrm{nC}$, the final gate voltage would be:\n$$\nV_{GS,final} \\approx 4.2\\,\\mathrm{V} + (1.35\\,\\mathrm{V}/\\mathrm{nC}) \\times (43.82\\,\\mathrm{nC} - 41.0\\,\\mathrm{nC})\n$$\n$$\nV_{GS,final} \\approx 4.2\\,\\mathrm{V} + 1.35 \\times 2.82\\,\\mathrm{V} \\approx 4.2\\,\\mathrm{V} + 3.807\\,\\mathrm{V} \\approx 8.007\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\nThis calculated final gate voltage of $\\approx 8.007\\,\\mathrm{V}$ is extremely close to the applied gate driver voltage of $8\\,\\mathrm{V}$. The minor discontinuity in the datasheet's description of the $V_{GS}(Q)$ curve (stating $V_{GS}=3.8\\,\\mathrm{V}$ at the end of the first segment and $V_{GS}=4.2\\,\\mathrm{V}$ at the start of the plateau) is a common imperfection in piecewise-linear models and does not detract from the overall strong consistency between the measured current and the device specifications. The measurement is physically consistent with the datasheet.\n\nThe problem asks only for the value of $Q_g$ calculated from the measured current.\n\nFinal calculation:\n$Q_g = 43.81775... \\,\\mathrm{nC}$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $43.82\\,\\mathrm{nC}$.",

Charging Phase (Turn-On)**\nDuring charging, the gate driver acts as a voltage source, raising the gate potential from $0$ to $V_{PP}$.\n\n- **Energy Supplied by the Source:** The source maintains a constant voltage $V_{PP}$ while delivering a total charge of $Q_g$. The work done by the source, which is the energy it supplies, is given by the integral of voltage with respect to charge:\n$$E_{\\text{source}} = \\int_0^{Q_g} V_{PP} \\, \\mathrm{d}q = V_{PP} \\int_0^{Q_g} \\mathrm{d}q = V_{PP} Q_g$$\n\n- **Energy Stored in the Gate Capacitance:** The problem defines an equivalent linear capacitance $C_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ such that $Q_g = C_{\\mathrm{eq}} V_{PP}$. The voltage across a linear capacitor is proportional to the charge stored on it, $v(q) = q/C_{\\mathrm{eq}}$. The energy stored in the capacitor when charged to $Q_g$ is the work done to assemble this charge:\n$$E_{\\text{stored}} = \\int_0^{Q_g} v(q) \\, \\mathrm{d}q = \\int_0^{Q_g} \\frac{q}{C_{\\mathrm{eq}}} \\, \\mathrm{d}q = \\frac{1}{C_{\\mathrm{eq}}} \\left[ \\frac{q^2}{2} \\right]_0^{Q_g} = \\frac{Q_g^2}{2 C_{\\mathrm{eq}}}$$\nSubstituting $C_{\\mathrm{eq}} = Q_g / V_{PP}$ into this expression yields:\n$$E_{\\text{stored}} = \\frac{Q_g^2}{2 (Q_g / V_{PP})} = \\frac{1}{2} Q_g V_{PP}$$\n\n- **Total Resistive Dissipation during Charging:** By the principle of conservation of energy, the energy supplied by the source must equal the sum of the energy stored in the capacitor and the energy dissipated as heat in the resistive elements of the circuit.\n$$E_{\\text{source}} = E_{\\text{stored}} + E_{\\text{res, c}}$$\nThe total energy dissipated in the resistances during charging, $E_{\\text{res, c}}$, is therefore:\n$$E_{\\text{res, c}} = E_{\\text{source}} - E_{\\text{stored}} = V_{PP} Q_g - \\frac{1}{2} Q_g V_{PP} = \\frac{1}{2} Q_g V_{PP}$$\nThis is a classic result: when charging a capacitor from a constant voltage source through a resistance, exactly half of the energy drawn from the source is dissipated as heat, and the other half is stored in the capacitor.\n\n- **Energy Dissipated in $R_g$ during Charging:** The problem states that a fraction $\\phi_c$ of the total resistive energy dissipation occurs across $R_g$.\n$$E_{R_g, \\text{c}} = \\phi_c E_{\\text{res, c}} = \\phi_c \\left( \\frac{1}{2} Q_g V_{PP} \\right)$$\n\n**2. Discharging Phase (Turn-Off)**\nDuring discharging, the gate is connected to the $0$V rail, and the energy stored in the gate capacitance is dissipated in the discharge path resistances.\n\n- **Total Resistive Dissipation during Discharging:** The initial energy stored in the capacitor is $E_{\\text{stored}} = \\frac{1}{2} Q_g V_{PP}$. As the gate discharges to $0$V, this stored energy is entirely converted into heat in the resistive elements. Thus, the total resistive energy dissipated during discharging, $E_{\\text{res, d}}$, is:\n$$E_{\\text{res, d}} = E_{\\text{stored}} = \\frac{1}{2} Q_g V_{PP}$$\n\n- **Energy Dissipated in $R_g$ during Discharging:** The problem states that a fraction $\\phi_d$ of this total dissipation occurs across $R_g$.\n$$E_{R_g, \\text{d}} = \\phi_d E_{\\text{res, d}} = \\phi_d \\left( \\frac{1}{2} Q_g V_{PP} \\right)$$\n\n**3. Total Energy Dissipation in $R_g$ per Cycle**\nThe total energy dissipated in $R_g$ over one complete cycle is the sum of the dissipations during charging and discharging:\n$$E_{R_g, \\text{cycle}} = E_{R_g, \\text{c}} + E_{R_g, \\text{d}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\phi_c Q_g V_{PP} + \\frac{1}{2} \\phi_d Q_g V_{PP}$$\nFactoring out the common terms gives the final closed-form expression:\n$$E_{R_g, \\text{cycle}} = \\frac{1}{2} Q_g V_{PP} (\\phi_c + \\phi_d)$$\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\nThe derived expression is now evaluated using the given numerical values:\n- $Q_g = 240\\,\\text{nC} = 240 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{C}$\n- $V_{PP} = 20\\,\\text{V}$\n- $\\phi_c = 0.62$\n- $\\phi_d = 0.48$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression:\n$$E_{R_g, \\text{cycle}} = \\frac{1}{2} (240 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{C}) (20\\,\\text{V}) (0.62 + 0.48)$$\n$$E_{R_g, \\text{cycle}} = \\frac{1}{2} (240 \\times 10^{-9}) (20) (1.10)\\,\\text{J}$$\n$$E_{R_g, \\text{cycle}} = (120 \\times 10^{-9}) (20) (1.10)\\,\\text{J}$$\n$$E_{R_g, \\text{cycle}} = (2400 \\times 10^{-9}) (1.10)\\,\\text{J}$$\n$$E_{R_g, \\text{cycle}} = 2640 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{J}$$\nTo express this value in microjoules ($1\\,\\mu\\text{J} = 10^{-6}\\,\\text{J}$):\n$$E_{R_g, \\text{cycle}} = 2.640 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{J} = 2.640\\,\\mu\\text{J}$$\nThe result, $2.640$, is expressed to four significant figures as required.",
