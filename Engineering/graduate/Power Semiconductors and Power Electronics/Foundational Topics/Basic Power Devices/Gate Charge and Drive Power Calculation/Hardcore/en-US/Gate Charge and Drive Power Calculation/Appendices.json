The datasheet specifies this occurs at $Q = 6.5\\,\\mathrm{nC}$. This is a very close match, confirming the first part of the waveform ($t \\in [0, 20\\,\\mathrm{ns}]$) is the pre-turn-on phase.\n- The second phase of charging ($Q_2 = 35\\,\\mathrm{nC}$) corresponds to the Miller plateau, where $V_{GS}$ is nearly constant while $V_{DS}$ falls. The datasheet specifies a charge of $\\Delta Q = 41.0\\,\\mathrm{nC} - 6.5\\,\\mathrm{nC} = 34.5\\,\\mathrm{nC}$ for this plateau. The measured value of $35\\,\\mathrm{nC}$ is in excellent agreement.\n- At the end of the Miller plateau (at $t=160\\,\\mathrm{ns}$), the total accumulated charge from measurement is $Q_{1}+Q_{2} \\approx 6.92 + 35 = 41.92\\,\\mathrm{nC}$. The datasheet specifies the plateau ends at $Q = 41.0\\,\\mathrm{nC}$, which again shows excellent consistency.\n- The final phase ($t  160\\,\\mathrm{ns}$) is the charging of the gate towards the final drive voltage of $8\\,\\mathrm{V}$. According to the datasheet, for $Q \\ge 41.0\\,\\mathrm{nC}$, the gate-source voltage increases as $V_{GS}(Q) = V_{GS,pl} + (dV_{GS}/dQ) \\times (Q - 41.0\\,\\mathrm{nC})$, where $V_{GS,pl} = 4.2\\,\\mathrm{V}$. At the total calculated charge $Q_g \\approx 43.82\\,\\mathrm{nC}$, the final gate voltage would be:\n$$\nV_{GS,final} \\approx 4.2\\,\\mathrm{V} + (1.35\\,\\mathrm{V}/\\mathrm{nC}) \\times (43.82\\,\\mathrm{nC} - 41.0\\,\\mathrm{nC})\n$$\n$$\nV_{GS,final} \\approx 4.2\\,\\mathrm{V} + 1.35 \\times 2.82\\,\\mathrm{V} \\approx 4.2\\,\\mathrm{V} + 3.807\\,\\mathrm{V} \\approx 8.007\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\nThis calculated final gate voltage of $\\approx 8.007\\,\\mathrm{V}$ is extremely close to the applied gate driver voltage of $8\\,\\mathrm{V}$. The minor discontinuity in the datasheet's description of the $V_{GS}(Q)$ curve (stating $V_{GS}=3.8\\,\\mathrm{V}$ at the end of the first segment and $V_{GS}=4.2\\,\\mathrm{V}$ at the start of the plateau) is a common imperfection in piecewise-linear models and does not detract from the overall strong consistency between the measured current and the device specifications. The measurement is physically consistent with the datasheet.\n\nThe problem asks only for the value of $Q_g$ calculated from the measured current.\n\nFinal calculation:\n$Q_g = 43.81775... \\,\\mathrm{nC}$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $43.82\\,\\mathrm{nC}$.",

A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Instantaneous Gate Current**\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the instantaneous gate current, $i_g(t)$, from the provided fundamental definitions. The gate charge $q$ is a function of the gate-source voltage $V_{GS}$, which itself is a function of time $t$. We can write this as $q(V_{GS}(t))$.\n\nThe definition of electric current is given as:\n$$i_g(t) = \\frac{dq}{dt}$$\nUsing the chain rule for differentiation, we can express $\\frac{dq}{dt}$ in terms of the voltage $V_{GS}$:\n$$i_g(t) = \\frac{dq}{dV_{GS}} \\cdot \\frac{dV_{GS}}{dt}$$\nThe problem defines the differential input capacitance as $C_{\\mathrm{iss}}(V_{GS}) = \\frac{dq}{dV_{GS}}$. Substituting this definition into the expression for the current yields the general formula for the instantaneous gate current:\n$$i_g(t) = C_{\\mathrm{iss}}(V_{GS}(t)) \\cdot \\frac{dV_{GS}}{dt}$$\nThis expression relates the instantaneous gate current to the instantaneous value of the input capacitance and the rate of change of the gate-source voltage. This completes the first part of the derivation.\n\n**Determination of the Peak Gate Current**\n\nNext, we must determine the peak gate current for the specific conditions given.\nThe gate-source voltage $V_{GS}(t)$ is specified as a linear ramp from $V_{GS}=0$ at $t=0$ to $V_{GS}=V_{G,\\mathrm{final}}$ at $t=T$. This implies a constant rate of change (slope):\n$$\\frac{dV_{GS}}{dt} = \\frac{V_{G,\\mathrm{final}} - 0}{T - 0} = \\frac{V_{G,\\mathrm{final}}}{T}$$\nThe specific form of the input capacitance is given as:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{iss}}(V_{GS}) = C_{0} + C_{1}\\,\\exp\\!\\big(\\alpha\\,V_{GS}\\big)$$\nSubstituting these into our derived expression for $i_g(t)$:\n$$i_g(t) = \\left( C_{0} + C_{1}\\,\\exp\\!\\big(\\alpha\\,V_{GS}(t)\\big) \\right) \\cdot \\frac{V_{G,\\mathrm{final}}}{T}$$\nTo find the peak current, $I_{g,\\mathrm{peak}}$, we must find the maximum value of $i_g(t)$ over the time interval $t \\in [0, T]$. Let's analyze the expression for $i_g(t)$.\nThe ramp rate $\\frac{V_{G,\\mathrm{final}}}{T}$ is a positive constant. The parameters $C_0$, $C_1$, and $\\alpha$ are all positive constants. The function $V_{GS}(t)$ is a linearly increasing function of time over the interval. The exponential function $\\exp(x)$ is a monotonically increasing function of its argument. Therefore, the term $\\exp\\!\\big(\\alpha\\,V_{GS}(t)\\big)$ is a monotonically increasing function of time $t$.\n\nSince all constituent parts of the function inside the parentheses are either constant or monotonically increasing, and are combined through addition and multiplication by positive constants, the entire capacitance term $C_{\\mathrm{iss}}(V_{GS}(t))$ is a monotonically increasing function of time $t$. Consequently, the gate current $i_g(t)$, which is the product of the increasing capacitance and a positive constant ramp rate, is also a monotonically increasing function of time on the interval $t \\in [0, T]$.\n\nThe maximum value of a monotonically increasing function on a closed interval occurs at the endpoint of the interval, which is $t=T$. At this time, the gate-source voltage reaches its final value, $V_{GS}(T) = V_{G,\\mathrm{final}}$.\nTherefore, the peak gate current $I_{g,\\mathrm{peak}}$ is:\n$$I_{g,\\mathrm{peak}} = i_g(T) = \\left( C_{0} + C_{1}\\,\\exp\\!\\big(\\alpha\\,V_{G,\\mathrm{final}}\\big) \\right) \\cdot \\frac{V_{G,\\mathrm{final}}}{T}$$\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into the expression for $I_{g,\\mathrm{peak}}$:\n- $C_{0} = 0.8 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\textrm{F}$\n- $C_{1} = 0.2 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\textrm{F}$\n- $\\alpha = 0.35\\ \\textrm{V}^{-1}$\n- $V_{G,\\mathrm{final}} = 10\\ \\textrm{V}$\n- $T = 50 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\textrm{s}$\n\nFirst, calculate the ramp rate:\n$$\\frac{V_{G,\\mathrm{final}}}{T} = \\frac{10\\ \\textrm{V}}{50 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\textrm{s}} = 0.2 \\times 10^{9}\\ \\frac{\\textrm{V}}{\\textrm{s}}$$\nNext, calculate the argument of the exponential at $V_{GS} = V_{G,\\mathrm{final}}$:\n$$\\alpha \\cdot V_{G,\\mathrm{final}} = (0.35\\ \\textrm{V}^{-1}) \\cdot (10\\ \\textrm{V}) = 3.5$$\nNow, assemble the expression for $I_{g,\\mathrm{peak}}$:\n$$I_{g,\\mathrm{peak}} = \\left( 0.8 \\times 10^{-9} + (0.2 \\times 10^{-9}) \\cdot \\exp(3.5) \\right) \\cdot \\left( 0.2 \\times 10^{9} \\right)$$\nThe factors of $10^{-9}$ and $10^{9}$ cancel out:\n$$I_{g,\\mathrm{peak}} = \\left( 0.8 + 0.2 \\cdot \\exp(3.5) \\right) \\cdot 0.2$$\n$$I_{g,\\mathrm{peak}} = 0.16 + 0.04 \\cdot \\exp(3.5)$$\nUsing a calculator for $\\exp(3.5)$:\n$$ \\exp(3.5) \\approx 33.115451958...$$\nSubstituting this value:\n$$I_{g,\\mathrm{peak}} \\approx 0.16 + 0.04 \\cdot (33.115451958...)$$\n$$I_{g,\\mathrm{peak}} \\approx 0.16 + 1.324618078...$$\n$$I_{g,\\mathrm{peak}} \\approx 1.484618078\\ \\textrm{A}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$I_{g,\\mathrm{peak}} \\approx 1.485\\ \\textrm{A}$$",
