This first practice takes you to the heart of device design, exploring the fundamental trade-off between a MOSFET's ability to block high voltages and its efficiency in conducting current. By starting from Poisson’s equation, you will determine the optimal doping and thickness for the drift region—the backbone of a high-voltage transistor—and calculate its contribution to the total on-resistance.

These are core, established principles in solid-state electronics and device physics. The provided values for silicon's physical properties ($q$, $\\varepsilon_s$, $\\mu_n$, $E_{crit}$) are standard and physically realistic.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It provides a clear objective (calculate $N_D$, $t$, and $R_{sp,drift}$) and sufficient information (material constants, target breakdown voltage, and simplifying approximations) to arrive at a unique solution. The \"no punch-through\" condition precisely defines the minimum required epilayer thickness.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and objective language. It is free of ambiguity, subjective claims, or non-scientific assertions.\n- **Other Checks**: The problem is self-contained and internally consistent. It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is a standard, formalizable problem in power semiconductor device design.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\nThe analysis begins with the one-dimensional Poisson's equation in the space-charge region of the $n$-type drift layer. For a one-sided abrupt $p^{+}$-$n$ junction, the depletion region extends almost entirely into the lightly doped $n$-side. Assuming full ionization of the donor atoms, the space charge density is $\\rho = q N_{D}$.\n\nLet the metallurgical junction be at $x=0$. The depletion region extends from $x=0$ to $x=W$ in the $n$-layer. Poisson's equation is:\n$$ \\frac{dE}{dx} = \\frac{q N_{D}}{\\varepsilon_s} $$\nwhere $E$ is the electric field, $N_D$ is the uniform donor concentration, $q$ is the elementary charge, and $\\varepsilon_s$ is the permittivity of silicon.\n\nThe electric field is found by integrating this equation. We use the boundary condition that the electric field must be zero at the edge of the depletion region, $E(W)=0$.\n$$ \\int_{E(x)}^{E(W)} dE' = \\int_{x}^{W} \\frac{q N_{D}}{\\varepsilon_s} dx' $$\n$$ E(W) - E(x) = \\frac{q N_{D}}{\\varepsilon_s} (W - x) $$\n$$ 0 - E(x) = \\frac{q N_{D}}{\\varepsilon_s} (W - x) \\implies E(x) = -\\frac{q N_{D}}{\\varepsilon_s} (W - x) $$\nThe electric field is negative (pointing in the $-x$ direction) and its magnitude is maximum at the junction ($x=0$):\n$$ E_{max} = |E(0)| = \\frac{q N_{D} W}{\\varepsilon_s} $$\nAvalanche breakdown occurs when this maximum field reaches the critical electric field, $E_{crit}$. At the breakdown voltage $\\mathrm{BV}$, the depletion width is $W_{BV}$. Thus, the first key relationship is:\n$$ E_{crit} = \\frac{q N_{D} W_{BV}}{\\varepsilon_s} \\quad (1) $$\nThe voltage across the depletion region is the integral of the electric field magnitude from $x=0$ to $x=W_{BV}$:\n$$ V = \\int_{0}^{W_{BV}} |E(x)| dx = \\int_{0}^{W_{BV}} \\frac{q N_{D}}{\\varepsilon_s} (W_{BV} - x) dx $$\n$$ V = \\frac{q N_{D}}{\\varepsilon_s} \\left[ W_{BV}x - \\frac{x^2}{2} \\right]_{0}^{W_{BV}} = \\frac{q N_{D}}{\\varepsilon_s} \\left( W_{BV}^2 - \\frac{W_{BV}^2}{2} \\right) = \\frac{q N_{D} W_{BV}^2}{2 \\varepsilon_s} $$\nThe breakdown voltage $\\mathrm{BV}$ is the voltage supported by the junction at the point of breakdown. This gives the second key relationship:\n$$ \\mathrm{BV} = \\frac{q N_{D} W_{BV}^2}{2 \\varepsilon_s} \\quad (2) $$\nWe have a system of two equations, $(1)$ and $(2)$, with two unknowns, $N_D$ and $W_{BV}$. The condition of \"no punch-through\" for a minimal design implies that the epilayer thickness $t$ must be equal to the depletion width at breakdown, $t = W_{BV}$.\n\nWe can solve for $t = W_{BV}$ and $N_D$. By dividing equation $(2)$ by equation $(1)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{BV}}{E_{crit}} = \\frac{q N_{D} W_{BV}^2 / (2 \\varepsilon_s)}{q N_{D} W_{BV} / \\varepsilon_s} = \\frac{W_{BV}}{2} $$\nFrom this, we derive the required epilayer thickness $t$:\n$$ t = W_{BV} = \\frac{2\\,\\mathrm{BV}}{E_{crit}} $$\nNow, we solve for $N_D$ by substituting this expression for $W_{BV}$ into equation $(1)$:\n$$ E_{crit} = \\frac{q N_{D}}{\\varepsilon_s} \\left( \\frac{2\\,\\mathrm{BV}}{E_{crit}} \\right) \\implies N_D = \\frac{\\varepsilon_s E_{crit}^2}{2 q\\, \\mathrm{BV}} $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values. First, calculate the permittivity of silicon:\n$$ \\varepsilon_s = \\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0 = 11.7 \\times (8.854 \\times 10^{-14}\\ \\mathrm{F/cm}) = 1.035938 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{F/cm} $$\nCalculate the required epilayer thickness $t$:\n$$ t = \\frac{2 \\times 600\\ \\mathrm{V}}{2.5 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{V/cm}} = \\frac{1200}{2.5 \\times 10^5}\\ \\mathrm{cm} = 4.8 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{cm} $$\nThe problem requests $t$ in $\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.

The solution will now be derived.\n\nThe task is to derive the intrinsic channel conductance from first principles, and then use it along with the measured data to compute the parasitic series resistance.\n\nThe drain current $I_D$ in an n-channel MOSFET is carried by the drift of electrons in the inversion layer. The drift current at any point $y$ along the channel (from source at $y=0$ to drain at $y=L$) is given by:\n$$I_D = W |Q_{inv}(y)| v_d(y)$$\nwhere $W$ is the channel width, $|Q_{inv}(y)|$ is the magnitude of the mobile inversion charge density per unit area, and $v_d(y)$ is the electron drift velocity.\n\nUnder the assumption that drift velocity is proportional to the local electric field $E(y)$ (i.e., no velocity saturation), we have:\n$$v_d(y) = \\mu_n E(y) = \\mu_n \\left(-\\frac{dV}{dy}\\right)$$\nThe current is defined as positive into the drain, which is opposite to the direction of electron flow. We account for this by using the magnitude of the velocity and charge, and integrating along the direction of increasing potential. The electric field is related to the gradient of the channel potential $V(y)$, so $E(y) = \\frac{dV}{dy}$ if we define the current direction from source to drain. Therefore, $v_d(y) = \\mu_n \\frac{dV}{dy}$.\n\nWithin the charge-sheet and gradual channel approximations, the inversion charge density at a point $y$ where the channel potential is $V(y)$ is:\n$$|Q_{inv}(y)| = C_{ox} (V_{GS} - V_{th} - V(y))$$\nwhere $V(y)$ is the potential with respect to the source.\n\nSubstituting these into the current equation gives:\n$$I_D = W \\mu_n C_{ox} (V_{GS} - V_{th} - V(y)) \\frac{dV}{dy}$$\nSince the current $I_D$ must be constant along the channel (assuming no generation or recombination), we can separate variables and integrate.

This figure of merit normalizes the on-state resistance to the active area of the silicon die and is defined as:\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{sp,on}} = R_{\\mathrm{Si}} \\times A_{\\mathrm{active}} $$\nwhere $R_{\\mathrm{Si}}$ is the intrinsic on-state resistance of the silicon die, and $A_{\\mathrm{active}}$ is the area of the die that actively conducts current. The estimation requires a two-part process: first, isolating the silicon resistance $R_{\\mathrm{Si}}$ from the total measured resistance, and second, calculating the active area $A_{\\mathrm{active}}$ from the given geometric data.\n\nThe required assumptions for this analysis are:\n1.  The total device resistance can be modeled as a simple series circuit, where the intrinsic silicon resistance and various extrinsic resistances add linearly.\n2.  The current flow is uniformly distributed across the entire active area of the MOSFET die. This implies a uniform cell density and uniform properties across the active region.\n3.  The specified extrinsic resistances are independent of the die active area and represent all non-silicon contributions to the total resistance.\n\nFirst, we calculate the intrinsic silicon resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{Si}}$. The datasheet provides the total drain-to-source on-state resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{DS(on)}}$, measured using a two-wire method, which includes extrinsic resistances from the package and interconnects. This total resistance is the sum of the intrinsic silicon resistance and the total extrinsic resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{ext}}$.\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{DS(on)}} = R_{\\mathrm{Si}} + R_{\\mathrm{ext}} $$\nThe problem provides the values for the individual extrinsic resistance components at $T_{\\mathrm{J}}=25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$:\n- Leadframe and leads resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{lead}} = 0.15\\,\\mathrm{m}\\Omega$.\n- Bond wires resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{bond}} = 0.35\\,\\mathrm{m}\\Omega$.\n- Top-side metallization and contacts resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{met}} = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{m}\\Omega$.\n- Solder attach and drain clip resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{solder}} = 0.40\\,\\mathrm{m}\\Omega$.\n\nThe total extrinsic resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{ext}}$, is the sum of these components:\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{ext}} = R_{\\mathrm{lead}} + R_{\\mathrm{bond}} + R_{\\mathrm{met}} + R_{\\mathrm{solder}} $$\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{ext}} = 0.15\\,\\mathrm{m}\\Omega + 0.35\\,\\mathrm{m}\\Omega + 0.10\\,\\mathrm{m}\\Omega + 0.40\\,\\mathrm{m}\\Omega = 1.00\\,\\mathrm{m}\\Omega $$\nThe total measured resistance is given as $R_{\\mathrm{DS(on)}} = 6.2\\,\\mathrm{m}\\Omega$. We can now solve for the silicon resistance $R_{\\mathrm{Si}}$:\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{Si}} = R_{\\mathrm{DS(on)}} - R_{\\mathrm{ext}} = 6.2\\,\\mathrm{m}\\Omega - 1.00\\,\\mathrm{m}\\Omega = 5.2\\,\\mathrm{m}\\Omega $$\n\nNext, we determine the active area of the silicon die, $A_{\\mathrm{active}}$. The overall die has lateral dimensions $L_{\\mathrm{die}} = 5.8\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and $W_{\\mathrm{die}} = 4.2\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. A termination guard ring of width $w_{\\mathrm{gr}} = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ runs along every edge. The active cell area is located within the window defined by this guard ring. The dimensions of this inner window are:\n$$ L_{\\mathrm{window}} = L_{\\mathrm{die}} - 2 \\times w_{\\mathrm{gr}} = 5.8\\,\\mathrm{mm} - 2 \\times 0.25\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 5.3\\,\\mathrm{mm} $$\n$$ W_{\\mathrm{window}} = W_{\\mathrm{die}} - 2 \\times w_{\\mathrm{gr}} = 4.2\\,\\mathrm{mm} - 2 \\times 0.25\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 3.7\\,\\mathrm{mm} $$\nThe total area within the guard ring window is:\n$$ A_{\\mathrm{window}} = L_{\\mathrm{window}} \\times W_{\\mathrm{window}} = 5.3\\,\\mathrm{mm} \\times 3.7\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 19.61\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2 $$\nWithin this window, there are several non-conducting features whose areas must be subtracted to find the true active area. The areas of these features are:\n- Source bond pad area: $A_{\\mathrm{pad}} = 1.6\\,\\mathrm{mm} \\times 1.2\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 1.92\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2$.\n- Gate bus stripe area: $A_{\\mathrm{gate}} = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{mm} \\times 4.0\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 0.80\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2$.\n- Sense/monitor pad area: $A_{\\mathrm{sense}} = 0.60\\,\\mathrm{mm} \\times 0.60\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 0.36\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2$.\n\nThe total non-conducting area, $A_{\\mathrm{non-active}}$, within the window is the sum of these areas:\n$$ A_{\\mathrm{non-active}} = A_{\\mathrm{pad}} + A_{\\mathrm{gate}} + A_{\\mathrm{sense}} = 1.92\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2 + 0.80\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2 + 0.36\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2 = 3.08\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2 $$\nThe active area, $A_{\\mathrm{active}}$, is the area of the window minus the total non-conducting area:\n$$ A_{\\mathrm{active}} = A_{\\mathrm{window}} - A_{\\mathrm{non-active}} = 19.61\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2 - 3.08\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2 = 16.53\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2 $$\nThe problem requires the specific on-state resistance to be expressed in units of $\\mathrm{m}\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$. Therefore, we must convert the active area from $\\mathrm{mm}^2$ to $\\mathrm{cm}^2$. Using the conversion factor $1\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 10\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, we have $1\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2 = 100\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2$.\n$$ A_{\\mathrm{active}} = 16.53\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2 \\times \\left( \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{cm}}{10\\,\\mathrm{mm}} \\right)^2 = 16.53\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2 \\times \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2}{100\\,\\mathrm{mm}^2} = 0.1653\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2 $$\nFinally, we can calculate the silicon-specific on-state resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{sp,on}}$:\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{sp,on}} = R_{\\mathrm{Si}} \\times A_{\\mathrm{active}} = 5.2\\,\\mathrm{m}\\Omega \\times 0.1653\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2 $$\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{sp,on}} = 0.85956\\,\\mathrm{m}\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^{2} $$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{sp,on}} \\approx 0.8596\\,\\mathrm{m}\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^{2} $$\nThis value represents the intrinsic performance of the silicon-based active cells, normalized by their area, and serves as a fundamental figure of merit for comparing different power MOSFET technologies.",
