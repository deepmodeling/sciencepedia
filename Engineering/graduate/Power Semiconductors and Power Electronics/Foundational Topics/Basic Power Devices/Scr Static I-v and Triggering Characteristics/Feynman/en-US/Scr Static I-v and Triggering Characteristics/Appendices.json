            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the established two-transistor model of a Silicon Controlled Rectifier (SCR), is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is expressed in objective, formal language. We can therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe operation of an SCR can be described by a two-transistor equivalent model, consisting of an interconnected $pnp$ transistor (T1) and an $npn$ transistor (T2). In this model, the collector of each transistor is connected to the base of the other, forming a positive feedback loop. The anode current, denoted by $I$, flows through this composite structure.\n\nFor the SCR to remain in the conducting, or ON-state, without any external gate current ($I_G = 0$), the regenerative feedback mechanism must be self-sustaining. This condition is met when the internal loop gain is equal to or greater than unity. The loop gain is determined by the common-base current gains of the two equivalent transistors, $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2$. The criterion for the SCR to stay latched in the ON-state is given by the well-known condition:\n$$\n\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 \\ge 1\n$$\nThe holding current, $I_H$, is defined as the minimum anode current $I$ for which the device remains in the ON-state. This corresponds to the threshold or boundary condition where the loop gain is exactly unity. Any current below $I_H$ will cause the loop gain to drop below unity, and the device will turn off due to insufficient regenerative feedback. Thus, the holding current $I_H$ is found by solving the equation:\n$$\n\\alpha_1(I_H) + \\alpha_2(I_H) = 1\n$$\nThe problem provides the current-dependent forms for the common-base current gains:\n$$\n\\alpha_{1}(I) = \\alpha_{1,\\infty} - \\frac{k_{1}}{I}\n$$\n$$\n\\alpha_{2}(I) = \\alpha_{2,\\infty} - \\frac{k_{2}}{I}\n$$\nwhere $I$ is the anode current.

Forward-Blocking Leakage Regime**\n\nThe problem asks for the \"simplest physically consistent affine dependence\" for the leakage current $I_A$ as a function of the anode-cathode voltage $V_{AK}$. This is a linear relationship of the form:\n$$I_A = G_L V_{AK} + I_{L0}$$\nHere, $G_L$ is the leakage conductance and $I_{L0}$ is the zero-voltage leakage current intercept. These parameters are determined by applying linear regression to Data Set 1. The model to be fitted is $y = mx+c$, where $y=I_A$, $x=V_{AK}$, $m=G_L$, and $c=I_{L0}$. We minimize the sum of squared errors $S = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - (mx_i+c))^2$.\n\nThe data provided are $n=5$ pairs $(V_i, I_i)$. Let's convert all data to base SI units:\n$V=\\{50, 100, 200, 300, 400\\}$ V.\n$I=\\{0.21, 0.35, 0.63, 0.91, 1.19\\} \\times 10^{-3}$ A.\n\nThe normal equations for linear least-squares fitting yield:\n$G_L = \\frac{n(\\sum V_i I_i) - (\\sum V_i)(\\sum I_i)}{n(\\sum V_i^2) - (\\sum V_i)^2}$\n$I_{L0} = \\frac{\\sum I_i - G_L(\\sum V_i)}{n}$\n\nWe compute the necessary sums:\n$\\sum V_i = 50+100+200+300+400 = 1050$ V.\n$\\sum I_i = (0.21+0.35+0.63+0.91+1.19) \\times 10^{-3} = 3.29 \\times 10^{-3}$ A.\n$\\sum V_i^2 = 50^2+100^2+200^2+300^2+400^2 = 302500$ V$^2$.\n$\\sum V_i I_i = (50 \\cdot 0.21 + 100 \\cdot 0.35 + 200 \\cdot 0.63 + 300 \\cdot 0.91 + 400 \\cdot 1.19) \\times 10^{-3} = (10.5+35+126+273+476) \\times 10^{-3} = 920.5 \\times 10^{-3}$ V·A.\n\nNow, we calculate $G_L$ and $I_{L0}$:\n$G_L = \\frac{5(920.5 \\times 10^{-3}) - (1050)(3.29 \\times 10^{-3})}{5(302500) - (1050)^2} = \\frac{(4602.5 - 3454.5) \\times 10^{-3}}{1512500 - 1102500} = \\frac{1148 \\times 10^{-3}}{410000} = 2.8 \\times 10^{-6}$ S.\nTo four significant figures, $G_L = 2.800 \\times 10^{-6}$ S.\n\n$I_{L0} = \\frac{3.29 \\times 10^{-3} - (2.8 \\times 10^{-6})(1050)}{5} = \\frac{(3.29 - 2.94) \\times 10^{-3}}{5} = \\frac{0.35 \\times 10^{-3}}{5} = 7 \\times 10^{-5}$ A.\nTo four significant figures, $I_{L0} = 7.000 \\times 10^{-5}$ A.\n\n**2. Regenerative Triggering Threshold**\n\nThe problem requires a model for the breakover voltage $V_{BO}$ that is the \"simplest dependence on gate current $I_G$ consistent with a linearized regenerative criterion\". The regenerative criterion for triggering is $\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 = 1$, where the current gains $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2$ of the equivalent two-transistor model are functions of voltage and current. A gate current $I_G$ increases $\\alpha_2$, while a higher anode voltage $V_{AK}$ increases $\\alpha_1$ (via avalanche multiplication). Linearizing the criterion $F(V_{BO}, I_G) = \\alpha_1(V_{BO}) + \\alpha_2(I_G) - 1 = 0$ around the zero-gate-current point $(V_{BO,0}, 0)$ leads to a linear relationship between $V_{BO}$ and $I_G$:\n$$V_{BO} = V_{BO,0} - k I_G$$\nwhere $V_{BO,0}$ is the breakover voltage at $I_G=0$ and $k$ is a constant representing the gate's control effectiveness. We fit this linear model to Data Set 2.\n\nThe data provided are $n=4$ pairs $(I_{G,i}, V_{BO,i})$:\n$I_G = \\{0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15\\}$ A.\n$V_{BO} = \\{600, 500, 400, 300\\}$ V.\n\nBy inspection, the data are perfectly linear. The slope $-k$ can be calculated from any two points:\n$-k = \\frac{\\Delta V_{BO}}{\\Delta I_G} = \\frac{500 - 600}{0.05 - 0} = \\frac{-100}{0.05} = -2000$ V/A.\nThus, $k = 2000$ $\\Omega$. To four significant figures, $k = 2.000 \\times 10^3$ $\\Omega$.\n\nThe intercept $V_{BO,0}$ is the value of $V_{BO}$ at $I_G=0$, which is given directly in the data as $600$ V.\nTo four significant figures, $V_{BO,0} = 6.000 \\times 10^2$ V.\n\n**3. On-State Conduction Regime**\n\nFor the on-state, the problem asks for the \"simplest first-order relation\" between terminal voltage $V_{AK}$ and anode current $I_A$. This is an affine model:\n$$V_{AK} = r_T I_A + V_{T0}$$\nwhere $r_T$ is the on-state dynamic resistance and $V_{T0}$ is the on-state threshold voltage. We determine these parameters by linear regression on Data Set 3. The model is $y = mx+c$, where $y=V_{AK}$, $x=I_A$, $m=r_T$, and $c=V_{T0}$.\n\nThe data provided are $n=4$ pairs $(I_i, V_i)$:\n$I=\\{25, 50, 100, 200\\}$ A.\n$V=\\{1.825, 1.95, 2.20, 2.70\\}$ V.\n\nWe compute the necessary sums:\n$\\sum I_i = 25+50+100+200 = 375$ A.\n$\\sum V_i = 1.825+1.95+2.20+2.70 = 8.675$ V.\n$\\sum I_i^2 = 25^2+50^2+100^2+200^2 = 625+2500+10000+40000 = 53125$ A$^2$.\n$\\sum I_i V_i = 25(1.825) + 50(1.95) + 100(2.20) + 200(2.70) = 45.625+97.5+220+540 = 903.125$ V·A.\n\nNow, we calculate $r_T$ and $V_{T0}$:\n$r_T = \\frac{n(\\sum I_i V_i) - (\\sum I_i)(\\sum V_i)}{n(\\sum I_i^2) - (\\sum I_i)^2} = \\frac{4(903.125) - (375)(8.675)}{4(53125) - (375)^2} = \\frac{3612.5 - 3253.125}{212500 - 140625} = \\frac{359.375}{71875} = 0.005$ $\\Omega$.\nTo four significant figures, $r_T = 5.000 \\times 10^{-3}$ $\\Omega$.\n\n$V_{T0} = \\frac{\\sum V_i - r_T(\\sum I_i)}{n} = \\frac{8.675 - (0.005)(375)}{4} = \\frac{8.675 - 1.875}{4} = \\frac{6.8}{4} = 1.7$ V.\nTo four significant figures, $V_{T0} = 1.700$ V.\n\n**Continuity and Final Model**\n\nThe requirement that the model be \"continuous at the triggering transition by construction\" implies that the piecewise definition of the overall static model must correctly account for the transition. The three derived models describe separate physical regimes. The forward-blocking model is valid for $V_{AK}  V_{BO}(I_G)$. At $V_{AK} = V_{BO}(I_G)$, the device triggers, and its operating point transitions to the on-state characteristic, $V_{AK} = V_{T0} + r_T I_A$.

The key is to account for the voltage drop across the series resistance of the measurement leads, $R_s$.\n\nAccording to Kirchhoff's Voltage Law, the total measured voltage, $V_{\\mathrm{meas}}$, across the two-wire terminals is the sum of the intrinsic voltage drop across the SCR, $V_{\\mathrm{SCR}}$, and the voltage drop across the series resistance of the leads, $V_s$.\n$$V_{\\mathrm{meas}} = V_{\\mathrm{SCR}} + V_s$$\nThe voltage drop across the leads is given by Ohm's Law:\n$$V_s = I R_s$$\nwhere $I$ is the current flowing through the circuit and $R_s$ is the given series resistance, $R_s = 3.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\Omega$.\n\nThe problem states that the intrinsic on-state characteristic of the SCR follows an affine relation, which can be modeled as:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{SCR}} = V_T + I R_{\\mathrm{on}}$$\nHere, $V_T$ is the intrinsic threshold voltage and $R_{\\mathrm{on}}$ is the intrinsic on-state dynamic resistance of the SCR.\n\nCombining these equations gives a model for the measured voltage:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{meas}} = (V_T + I R_{\\mathrm{on}}) + I R_s = V_T + I (R_{\\mathrm{on}} + R_s)$$\nThis shows that the measured voltage $V_{\\mathrm{meas}}$ is also a linear function of the current $I$. The y-intercept of this linear relationship corresponds to the intrinsic threshold voltage $V_T$.\n\nTo \"de-embed\" the lead resistance as requested, we first correct the measured voltage values to find the intrinsic voltage across the SCR for each data point. Rearranging the first equation, we get:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{SCR}} = V_{\\mathrm{meas}} - I R_s$$\nWe are given $R_s = 3.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\Omega$. We can now calculate the intrinsic SCR voltage for each of the four data points:\n\n1.  For $(I_1, V_{\\mathrm{meas},1}) = (50\\ \\mathrm{A}, 1.175\\ \\mathrm{V})$:\n    $$V_{\\mathrm{SCR},1} = 1.175\\ \\mathrm{V} - (50\\ \\mathrm{A}) \\times (3.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\Omega) = 1.175\\ \\mathrm{V} - 0.150\\ \\mathrm{V} = 1.025\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\n    The de-embedded data point is $(50\\ \\mathrm{A}, 1.025\\ \\mathrm{V})$.\n\n2.  For $(I_2, V_{\\mathrm{meas},2}) = (100\\ \\mathrm{A}, 1.450\\ \\mathrm{V})$:\n    $$V_{\\mathrm{SCR},2} = 1.450\\ \\mathrm{V} - (100\\ \\mathrm{A}) \\times (3.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\Omega) = 1.450\\ \\mathrm{V} - 0.300\\ \\mathrm{V} = 1.150\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\n    The de-embedded data point is $(100\\ \\mathrm{A}, 1.150\\ \\mathrm{V})$.\n\n3.  For $(I_3, V_{\\mathrm{meas},3}) = (150\\ \\mathrm{A}, 1.725\\ \\mathrm{V})$:\n    $$V_{\\mathrm{SCR},3} = 1.725\\ \\mathrm{V} - (150\\ \\mathrm{A}) \\times (3.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\Omega) = 1.725\\ \\mathrm{V} - 0.450\\ \\mathrm{V} = 1.275\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\n    The de-embedded data point is $(150\\ \\mathrm{A}, 1.275\\ \\mathrm{V})$.\n\n4.  For $(I_4, V_{\\mathrm{meas},4}) = (200\\ \\mathrm{A}, 2.000\\ \\mathrm{V})$:\n    $$V_{\\mathrm{SCR},4} = 2.000\\ \\mathrm{V} - (200\\ \\mathrm{A}) \\times (3.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\Omega) = 2.000\\ \\mathrm{V} - 0.600\\ \\mathrm{V} = 1.400\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\n    The de-embedded data point is $(200\\ \\mathrm{A}, 1.400\\ \\mathrm{V})$.\n\nNow we have a set of intrinsic data points $(I, V_{\\mathrm{SCR}})$ that follow the linear model $V_{\\mathrm{SCR}} = V_T + I R_{\\mathrm{on}}$. The slope of this line is $R_{\\mathrm{on}}$ and the y-intercept is $V_T$. We can determine these parameters from the corrected data.\n\nFirst, we calculate the slope, $R_{\\mathrm{on}}$, using any two of the corrected points. Let's use the first two:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{on}} = \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{SCR}}}{\\Delta I} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{SCR},2} - V_{\\mathrm{SCR},1}}{I_2 - I_1} = \\frac{1.150\\ \\mathrm{V} - 1.025\\ \\mathrm{V}}{100\\ \\mathrm{A} - 50\\ \\mathrm{A}} = \\frac{0.125\\ \\mathrm{V}}{50\\ \\mathrm{A}} = 0.0025\\ \\Omega$$\nSince the provided data were constructed to be perfectly linear, any pair of points will yield the same slope. For instance, using points 3 and 4:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{on}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{SCR},4} - V_{\\mathrm{SCR},3}}{I_4 - I_3} = \\frac{1.400\\ \\mathrm{V} - 1.275\\ \\mathrm{V}}{200\\ \\mathrm{A} - 150\\ \\mathrm{A}} = \\frac{0.125\\ \\mathrm{V}}{50\\ \\mathrm{A}} = 0.0025\\ \\Omega$$\nThe intrinsic dynamic resistance is constant, $R_{\\mathrm{on}} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\Omega$.\n\nNow, we can find the intrinsic threshold voltage $V_T$, which is the intercept of the line $V_{\\mathrm{SCR}}(I)$. We can use the point-slope form of a linear equation, $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$, rearranged to solve for the intercept. The intercept is the value of $V_{\\mathrm{SCR}}$ when $I=0$.\n$$V_T = V_{\\mathrm{SCR},1} - I_1 R_{\\mathrm{on}}$$\nUsing the first de-embedded data point $(50\\ \\mathrm{A}, 1.025\\ \\mathrm{V})$ and the calculated slope $R_{\\mathrm{on}} = 0.0025\\ \\Omega$:\n$$V_T = 1.025\\ \\mathrm{V} - (50\\ \\mathrm{A}) \\times (0.0025\\ \\Omega) = 1.025\\ \\mathrm{V} - 0.125\\ \\mathrm{V} = 0.900\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\nVerifying with the last data point $(200\\ \\mathrm{A}, 1.400\\ \\mathrm{V})$:\n$$V_T = 1.400\\ \\mathrm{V} - (200\\ \\mathrm{A}) \\times (0.0025\\ \\Omega) = 1.400\\ \\mathrm{V} - 0.500\\ \\mathrm{V} = 0.900\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\nThe result is consistently $V_T = 0.900\\ \\mathrm{V}$.\n\nThe problem requests the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $0.9$. To express this with four significant figures, we write it as $0.9000$.",
