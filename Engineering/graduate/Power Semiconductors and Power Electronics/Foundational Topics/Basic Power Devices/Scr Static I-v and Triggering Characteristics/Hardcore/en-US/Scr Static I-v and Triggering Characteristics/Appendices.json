A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe task is to construct a piecewise static model for an SCR and determine its parameters from experimental data. This involves analyzing three distinct operating regimes.\n\n**1. Forward-Blocking Leakage Regime**\n\nThe problem asks for the \"simplest physically consistent affine dependence\" for the leakage current $I_A$ as a function of the anode-cathode voltage $V_{AK}$. This is a linear relationship of the form:\n$$I_A = G_L V_{AK} + I_{L0}$$\nHere, $G_L$ is the leakage conductance and $I_{L0}$ is the zero-voltage leakage current intercept. These parameters are determined by applying linear regression to Data Set 1. The model to be fitted is $y = mx+c$, where $y=I_A$, $x=V_{AK}$, $m=G_L$, and $c=I_{L0}$. We minimize the sum of squared errors $S = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - (mx_i+c))^2$.\n\nThe data provided are $n=5$ pairs $(V_i, I_i)$. Let's convert all data to base SI units:\n$V=\\{50, 100, 200, 300, 400\\}$ V.\n$I=\\{0.21, 0.35, 0.63, 0.91, 1.19\\} \\times 10^{-3}$ A.\n\nThe normal equations for linear least-squares fitting yield:\n$G_L = \\frac{n(\\sum V_i I_i) - (\\sum V_i)(\\sum I_i)}{n(\\sum V_i^2) - (\\sum V_i)^2}$\n$I_{L0} = \\frac{\\sum I_i - G_L(\\sum V_i)}{n}$\n\nWe compute the necessary sums:\n$\\sum V_i = 50+100+200+300+400 = 1050$ V.\n$\\sum I_i = (0.21+0.35+0.63+0.91+1.19) \\times 10^{-3} = 3.29 \\times 10^{-3}$ A.\n$\\sum V_i^2 = 50^2+100^2+200^2+300^2+400^2 = 302500$ V$^2$.\n$\\sum V_i I_i = (50 \\cdot 0.21 + 100 \\cdot 0.35 + 200 \\cdot 0.63 + 300 \\cdot 0.91 + 400 \\cdot 1.19) \\times 10^{-3} = (10.5+35+126+273+476) \\times 10^{-3} = 920.5 \\times 10^{-3}$ V·A.\n\nNow, we calculate $G_L$ and $I_{L0}$:\n$G_L = \\frac{5(920.5 \\times 10^{-3}) - (1050)(3.29 \\times 10^{-3})}{5(302500) - (1050)^2} = \\frac{(4602.5 - 3454.5) \\times 10^{-3}}{1512500 - 1102500} = \\frac{1148 \\times 10^{-3}}{410000} = 2.8 \\times 10^{-6}$ S.\nTo four significant figures, $G_L = 2.800 \\times 10^{-6}$ S.\n\n$I_{L0} = \\frac{3.29 \\times 10^{-3} - (2.8 \\times 10^{-6})(1050)}{5} = \\frac{(3.29 - 2.94) \\times 10^{-3}}{5} = \\frac{0.35 \\times 10^{-3}}{5} = 7 \\times 10^{-5}$ A.\nTo four significant figures, $I_{L0} = 7.000 \\times 10^{-5}$ A.\n\n**2. Regenerative Triggering Threshold**\n\nThe problem requires a model for the breakover voltage $V_{BO}$ that is the \"simplest dependence on gate current $I_G$ consistent with a linearized regenerative criterion\". The regenerative criterion for triggering is $\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 = 1$, where the current gains $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2$ of the equivalent two-transistor model are functions of voltage and current. A gate current $I_G$ increases $\\alpha_2$, while a higher anode voltage $V_{AK}$ increases $\\alpha_1$ (via avalanche multiplication). Linearizing the criterion $F(V_{BO}, I_G) = \\alpha_1(V_{BO}) + \\alpha_2(I_G) - 1 = 0$ around the zero-gate-current point $(V_{BO,0}, 0)$ leads to a linear relationship between $V_{BO}$ and $I_G$:\n$$V_{BO} = V_{BO,0} - k I_G$$\nwhere $V_{BO,0}$ is the breakover voltage at $I_G=0$ and $k$ is a constant representing the gate's control effectiveness. We fit this linear model to Data Set 2.\n\nThe data provided are $n=4$ pairs $(I_{G,i}, V_{BO,i})$:\n$I_G = \\{0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15\\}$ A.\n$V_{BO} = \\{600, 500, 400, 300\\}$ V.\n\nBy inspection, the data are perfectly linear. The slope $-k$ can be calculated from any two points:\n$-k = \\frac{\\Delta V_{BO}}{\\Delta I_G} = \\frac{500 - 600}{0.05 - 0} = \\frac{-100}{0.05} = -2000$ V/A.\nThus, $k = 2000$ $\\Omega$. To four significant figures, $k = 2.000 \\times 10^3$ $\\Omega$.\n\nThe intercept $V_{BO,0}$ is the value of $V_{BO}$ at $I_G=0$, which is given directly in the data as $600$ V.\nTo four significant figures, $V_{BO,0} = 600.0$ V, or $6.000 \\times 10^2$ V.\n\n**3. On-State Conduction Regime**\n\nFor the on-state, the problem asks for the \"simplest first-order relation\" between terminal voltage $V_{AK}$ and anode current $I_A$. This is an affine model:\n$$V_{AK} = r_T I_A + V_{T0}$$\nwhere $r_T$ is the on-state dynamic resistance and $V_{T0}$ is the on-state threshold voltage. We determine these parameters by linear regression on Data Set 3. The model is $y = mx+c$, where $y=V_{AK}$, $x=I_A$, $m=r_T$, and $c=V_{T0}$.\n\nThe data provided are $n=4$ pairs $(I_i, V_i)$:\n$I=\\{25, 50, 100, 200\\}$ A.\n$V=\\{1.825, 1.95, 2.20, 2.70\\}$ V.\n\nWe compute the necessary sums:\n$\\sum I_i = 25+50+100+200 = 375$ A.\n$\\sum V_i = 1.825+1.95+2.20+2.70 = 8.675$ V.\n$\\sum I_i^2 = 25^2+50^2+100^2+200^2 = 625+2500+10000+40000 = 53125$ A$^2$.\n$\\sum I_i V_i = 25(1.825) + 50(1.95) + 100(2.20) + 200(2.70) = 45.625+97.5+220+540 = 903.125$ V·A.\n\nNow, we calculate $r_T$ and $V_{T0}$:\n$r_T = \\frac{n(\\sum I_i V_i) - (\\sum I_i)(\\sum V_i)}{n(\\sum I_i^2) - (\\sum I_i)^2} = \\frac{4(903.125) - (375)(8.675)}{4(53125) - (375)^2} = \\frac{3612.5 - 3253.125}{212500 - 140625} = \\frac{359.375}{71875} = 0.005$ $\\Omega$.\nTo four significant figures, $r_T = 5.000 \\times 10^{-3}$ $\\Omega$.\n\n$V_{T0} = \\frac{\\sum V_i - r_T(\\sum I_i)}{n} = \\frac{8.675 - (0.005)(375)}{4} = \\frac{8.675 - 1.875}{4} = \\frac{6.8}{4} = 1.7$ V.\nTo four significant figures, $V_{T0} = 1.700$ V.\n\n**Continuity and Final Model**\n\nThe requirement that the model be \"continuous at the triggering transition by construction\" implies that the piecewise definition of the overall static model must correctly account for the transition. The three derived models describe separate physical regimes. The forward-blocking model is valid for $V_{AK}  V_{BO}(I_G)$. At $V_{AK} = V_{BO}(I_G)$, the device triggers, and its operating point transitions to the on-state characteristic, $V_{AK} = V_{T0} + r_T I_A$. The parameters for each regime were determined independently from distinct data sets, as is appropriate for this type of piecewise model.\n\n**Summary of Parameters**\n\nThe extracted parameters, in base SI units and rounded to four significant figures, are:\n- $I_{L0} = 7.000 \\times 10^{-5}$ A\n- $G_L = 2.800 \\times 10^{-6}$ S\n- $V_{\\text{BO},0} = 6.000 \\times 10^2$ V\n- $k = 2.000 \\times 10^3$ $\\Omega$\n- $V_{T0} = 1.700$ V\n- $r_T = 5.000 \\times 10^{-3}$ $\\Omega$\n\nThe final parameter vector $p = \\big[I_{L0},\\,G_{L},\\,V_{\\text{BO},0},\\,k,\\,V_{T0},\\,r_{T}\\big]$ is assembled.",

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the established two-transistor model of a Silicon Controlled Rectifier (SCR), is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is expressed in objective, formal language. We can therefore proceed with a solution.\n\nThe operation of an SCR can be described by a two-transistor equivalent model, consisting of an interconnected $pnp$ transistor (T1) and an $npn$ transistor (T2). In this model, the collector of each transistor is connected to the base of the other, forming a positive feedback loop. The anode current, denoted by $I$, flows through this composite structure.\n\nFor the SCR to remain in the conducting, or ON-state, without any external gate current ($I_G = 0$), the regenerative feedback mechanism must be self-sustaining. This condition is met when the internal loop gain is equal to or greater than unity. The loop gain is determined by the common-base current gains of the two equivalent transistors, $\\alpha_1$ and $\\alpha_2$. The criterion for the SCR to stay latched in the ON-state is given by the well-known condition:\n$$\n\\alpha_1 + \\alpha_2 \\ge 1\n$$\nThe holding current, $I_H$, is defined as the minimum anode current $I$ for which the device remains in the ON-state.

The latching current is given as $I_{L} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{A}$, and the test pulse amplitude is $I_{p} = 1.2\\,I_{L}$.\n$$ I_{p} = 1.2 \\times 1.0\\,\\mathrm{A} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{A} $$\nThe on-state voltage drop across the SCR at this current is given by $V_{T}(I) = V_{T0} + r_{t}\\,I$, with $V_{T0} = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{V}$ and $r_{t} = 0.4\\,\\Omega$.\n$$ V_{T}(I_p) = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{V} + (0.4\\,\\Omega)(1.2\\,\\mathrm{A}) = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{V} + 0.48\\,\\mathrm{V} = 1.28\\,\\mathrm{V} $$\nThe instantaneous power dissipated in the SCR during the pulse is constant:\n$$ P_{D} = V_{T}(I_p) \\times I_{p} = (1.28\\,\\mathrm{V})(1.2\\,\\mathrm{A}) = 1.536\\,\\mathrm{W} $$\n\n**Criterion (i): Regenerative Latch (Charge Storage)**\n\nThe dynamics of the minority-carrier stored charge $Q(t)$ are described by the charge-control equation. For a constant current pulse $I_p$ applied at $t=0$ to a device with initial charge $Q(0)=0$, the governing equation is:\n$$ \\frac{dQ(t)}{dt} = I_{p} - \\frac{Q(t)}{\\tau_{F}} $$\nwhere $\\tau_{F} = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$ is the effective forward diffusion lifetime. The solution to this first-order linear ordinary differential equation is:\n$$ Q(t) = I_{p}\\tau_{F}\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{F}}\\right)\\right) $$\nFor the SCR to latch, the stored charge at the end of the pulse, $Q(t_p)$, must be at least the minimum latching charge, $Q_{\\mathrm{lat}} = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{C}$. The minimum pulse width required to achieve this, denoted $t_{p, \\text{charge}}$, is found by setting $Q(t_{p, \\text{charge}}) = Q_{\\mathrm{lat}}$.\n$$ Q_{\\mathrm{lat}} = I_{p}\\tau_{F}\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{p, \\text{charge}}}{\\tau_{F}}\\right)\\right) $$\nSolving for $t_{p, \\text{charge}}$:\n$$ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{p, \\text{charge}}}{\\tau_{F}}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{Q_{\\mathrm{lat}}}{I_{p}\\tau_{F}} $$\n$$ t_{p, \\text{charge}} = -\\tau_{F} \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{Q_{\\mathrm{lat}}}{I_{p}\\tau_{F}}\\right) $$\nWe have $I_p = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\tau_F = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$, so the steady-state charge is $I_{p}\\tau_{F} = (1.2\\,\\mathrm{A})(20 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}) = 24 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{C} = 24\\,\\mu\\mathrm{C}$.\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ t_{p, \\text{charge}} = -(20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}) \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{C}}{24\\,\\mu\\mathrm{C}}\\right) = -(20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}) \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{5}{12}\\right) = -(20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{7}{12}\\right) = (20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{12}{7}\\right) $$\nNumerically, $t_{p, \\text{charge}} \\approx 10.7797\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$. Any valid pulse width $t_p$ must satisfy $t_p \\ge t_{p, \\text{charge}}$.\n\n**Criterion (ii): Junction Temperature Rise**\n\nThe junction temperature rise $\\Delta T_{J}(t)$ is modeled by a single-pole thermal network. For a step power input $P_D$ starting at $t=0$, with initial temperature rise $\\Delta T_J(0)=0$, the solution is:\n$$ \\Delta T_{J}(t) = P_{D}R_{\\mathrm{th,JA}}\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{th}}}\\right)\\right) $$\nwhere $R_{\\mathrm{th,JA}} = 30\\,\\mathrm{K/W}$ and $\\tau_{\\mathrm{th}} = 0.12\\,\\mathrm{s}$. The constraint is that the temperature rise must not exceed $\\Delta T_{\\max} = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{K}$. Let $t_{p, \\text{thermal}}$ be the maximum pulse width that satisfies this condition, found by setting $\\Delta T_{J}(t_{p, \\text{thermal}}) = \\Delta T_{\\max}$.\n$$ \\Delta T_{\\max} = P_{D}R_{\\mathrm{th,JA}}\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{p, \\text{thermal}}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{th}}}\\right)\\right) $$\nSolving for $t_{p, \\text{thermal}}$:\n$$ t_{p, \\text{thermal}} = -\\tau_{\\mathrm{th}} \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{\\Delta T_{\\max}}{P_{D}R_{\\mathrm{th,JA}}}\\right) $$\nThe steady-state temperature rise is $P_{D}R_{\\mathrm{th,JA}} = (1.536\\,\\mathrm{W})(30\\,\\mathrm{K/W}) = 46.08\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ t_{p, \\text{thermal}} = -(0.12\\,\\mathrm{s}) \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{0.5\\,\\mathrm{K}}{46.08\\,\\mathrm{K}}\\right) $$\nNumerically, $t_{p, \\text{thermal}} \\approx 0.0013091\\,\\mathrm{s} = 1309.1\\,\\mu\\mathrms$. Any valid pulse width $t_p$ must satisfy $t_p \\le t_{p, \\text{thermal}}$.\n\n**Conclusion and Final Answer**\n\nA pulse width $t_p$ is acceptable if and only if it satisfies both conditions: $t_{p, \\text{charge}} \\le t_p \\le t_{p, \\text{thermal}}$.\nWe have found:\n$$ t_{p, \\text{charge}} \\approx 10.78\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s} $$\n$$ t_{p, \\text{thermal}} \\approx 1309\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s} $$\nThe problem asks for the minimum pulse width $t_p$ that guarantees both conditions. This value is the lower bound of the valid interval, which is $t_p = t_{p, \\text{charge}}$.\n\nWe must show this choice is valid.\n1.  By setting $t_p = t_{p, \\text{charge}}$, the stored charge is $Q(t_p) = Q_{\\mathrm{lat}}$, satisfying the latching criterion.\n2.  We must check if this $t_p$ satisfies the thermal criterion: $t_p \\le t_{p, \\text{thermal}}$. Since $10.78\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s} \\le 1309\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$, the condition is met. The temperature rise at $t_p=t_{p, \\text{charge}}$ will be significantly less than $\\Delta T_{\\max}$. For completeness, the temperature rise at this pulse width is:\n    $$ \\Delta T_{J}(t_{p, \\text{charge}}) = (46.08\\,\\mathrm{K})\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{10.78\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}}{0.12\\,\\mathrm{s}}\\right)\\right) \\approx 0.00414\\,\\mathrm{K} $$\n    As expected, $0.00414\\,\\mathrm{K} \\ll 0.5\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nThe minimum required pulse width is $t_{p, \\text{charge}} = (20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}) \\ln(12/7) \\approx 10.7797\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$.\nRounding to three significant figures, as requested, we obtain $10.8\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s}$.",
