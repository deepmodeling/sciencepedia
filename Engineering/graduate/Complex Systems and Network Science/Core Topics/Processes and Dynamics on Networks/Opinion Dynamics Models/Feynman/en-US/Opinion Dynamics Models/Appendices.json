            "problem": "Consider a network of three agents labeled $1$, $2$, and $3$. Their interaction structure is a weighted directed graph that induces a row-stochastic influence matrix $W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times 3}$ for a DeGroot opinion dynamics, where the update is $x(t+1)=W x(t)$ for the opinion vector $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$.

            "solution": "The problem is well-defined and scientifically sound, grounded in the established theory of linear consensus models (the DeGroot model). All necessary components, including the influence matrix $W$, the initial state vector $x(0)$, and the update rule $x(t+1) = Wx(t)$, are provided. The matrix $W$ is explicitly given as\n$$\nW=\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{4} & \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{4} \\\\\n0 & \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nIt is a row-stochastic matrix, as the sum of elements in each row is $1$. The entries $W_{ij}$ represent the weight agent $i$ gives to the opinion of agent $j$. The directed graph associated with $W$ has an edge from node $j$ to node $i$ if $W_{ij} > 0$. The edges are $1 \\to 1$, $2 \\to 1$, $1 \\to 2$, $2 \\to 2$, $3 \\to 2$, $2 \\to 3$, and $3 \\to 3$.\nThis graph is strongly connected:\n- From node $1$, one can reach nodes $1$ and $2$. From node $2$, one can reach node $3$. Thus, $1 \\to 2 \\to 3$.\n- From node $2$, one can reach nodes $1$, $2$, and $3$.\n- From node $3$, one can reach nodes $2$ and $3$. From node $2$, one can reach node $1$. Thus, $3 \\to 2 \\to 1$.\nSince every node can reach every other node, the graph is strongly connected. Furthermore, since all diagonal elements $W_{ii}$ are positive, the associated Markov chain is aperiodic. A row-stochastic matrix corresponding to a strongly connected, aperiodic graph is primitive.\n\nBy the Perron-Frobenius theorem for stochastic matrices, such a matrix $W$ has a simple eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = 1$, and all other eigenvalues have a magnitude strictly less than $1$. The left eigenvector $\\pi^{\\top}$ corresponding to $\\lambda_1 = 1$ is unique (up to scaling) and can be normalized such that its components $\\pi_i$ are positive and sum to $1$. This vector $\\pi$ is the stationary distribution of the Markov chain defined by $W$.\n\nThe opinion dynamics evolve as $x(t) = W^t x(0)$. For a primitive row-stochastic matrix $W$, the limit of $W^t$ as $t \\to \\infty$ exists and is given by $W^\\infty = \\mathbf{1}\\pi^\\top$, where $\\mathbf{1}$ is the column vector of all ones. Therefore, the opinion vector $x(t)$ converges to a consensus state:\n$$\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} x(t) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} W^t x(0) = (\\mathbf{1}\\pi^\\top) x(0) = \\mathbf{1}(\\pi^\\top x(0)) = \\begin{pmatrix} c \\\\ c \\\\ c \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe consensus value $c$ is the weighted average of the initial opinions, where the weights are the components of the stationary distribution $\\pi$:\n$$\nc = \\pi^\\top x(0) = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\pi_i x_i(0)\n$$\nOur first step is to find the stationary distribution $\\pi = (\\pi_1, \\pi_2, \\pi_3)$ by solving the system of linear equations defined by $\\pi^\\top W = \\pi^\\top$, subject to the normalization constraint $\\sum_{i=1}^{3} \\pi_i = 1$. The equation $\\pi^\\top W = \\pi^\\top$ is equivalent to $\\pi^\\top (W - I) = 0$, or $(W^\\top - I)\\pi = 0$.\n\nThe transpose of $W$ is\n$$\nW^\\top = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{4} & 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{2} \\\\\n0 & \\frac{1}{4} & \\frac{1}{2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSo, $W^\\top - I$ is\n$$\nW^\\top - I = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{2}-1 & \\frac{1}{4} & 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{2}-1 & \\frac{1}{2} \\\\\n0 & \\frac{1}{4} & \\frac{1}{2}-1\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-\\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{4} & 0 \\\\\n\\frac{1}{2} & -\\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{2} \\\\\n0 & \\frac{1}{4} & -\\frac{1}{2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe system of equations $(W^\\top - I)\\pi = 0$ is:\n1. $-\\frac{1}{2}\\pi_1 + \\frac{1}{4}\\pi_2 = 0$\n2. $\\frac{1}{2}\\pi_1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\pi_2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\pi_3 = 0$\n3. $\\frac{1}{4}\\pi_2 - \\frac{1}{2}\\pi_3 = 0$\n\nFrom equation (1), we have $\\frac{1}{4}\\pi_2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\pi_1$, which implies $\\pi_2 = 2\\pi_1$.\nFrom equation (3), we have $\\frac{1}{4}\\pi_2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\pi_3$, which implies $\\pi_2 = 2\\pi_3$, or $\\pi_3 = \\frac{1}{2}\\pi_2$.\nSubstituting $\\pi_1 = \\frac{1}{2}\\pi_2$ and $\\pi_3 = \\frac{1}{2}\\pi_2$ into equation (2) gives:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\pi_2\\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\\pi_2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\pi_2\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\\pi_2 - \\frac{1}{2}\\pi_2 + \\frac{1}{4}\\pi_2 = 0\n$$\nwhich simplifies to $0=0$. This confirms the consistency of the equations. We can express $\\pi_1$ and $\\pi_3$ in terms of $\\pi_2$: $\\pi_1 = \\frac{1}{2}\\pi_2$ and $\\pi_3 = \\frac{1}{2}\\pi_2$.\n\nNow, we use the normalization condition $\\pi_1 + \\pi_2 + \\pi_3 = 1$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}\\pi_2 + \\pi_2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\pi_2 = 1\n$$\n$$\n2\\pi_2 = 1 \\implies \\pi_2 = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nUsing this, we find the other components:\n$$\n\\pi_1 = \\frac{1}{2}\\pi_2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\n$$\n\\pi_3 = \\frac{1}{2}\\pi_2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\nSo, the stationary distribution is $\\pi = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{4}\\right)^\\top$.\n\nThe final step is to calculate the consensus value $c$ using the initial opinion vector $x(0) = \\left(\\frac{3}{2}, -\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{5}{2}\\right)^\\top$:\n$$\nc = \\pi^\\top x(0) = \\pi_1 x_1(0) + \\pi_2 x_2(0) + \\pi_3 x_3(0)\n$$\n$$\nc = \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nc = \\frac{3}{8} - \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{5}{8}\n$$\nTo sum these fractions, we use a common denominator of $8$:\n$$\nc = \\frac{3}{8} - \\frac{2}{8} + \\frac{5}{8} = \\frac{3 - 2 + 5}{8} = \\frac{6}{8}\n$$\n$$\nc = \\frac{3}{4}\n$$\nThe limiting consensus value that all agents' opinions will approach is $\\frac{3}{4}$.",

This is where consensus states (stable non-zero fixed points) can emerge via a pitchfork bifurcation.\n\nWe need to calculate $F'(m)$ and evaluate it at $m=0$.\nWe have $m(t+1) = F(m(t))$. Let's express $F(m)$ using $P_{maj-}=1-P_{maj+}$:\n$F(m) = (1-2q)(P_{maj+} - (1-P_{maj+})) = (1-2q)(2P_{maj+} - 1)$.\nUsing the chain rule, $F'(m) = \\frac{dF}{dm} = \\frac{dF}{dp} \\frac{dp}{dm}$.\nWe have $\\frac{dp}{dm} = \\frac{d}{dm}\\left(\\frac{1+m}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nAnd $\\frac{dF}{dp} = (1-2q) \\frac{d}{dp}(2P_{maj+} - 1) = 2(1-2q)\\frac{dP_{maj+}}{dp}$.\nSo, $F'(m) = (1-2q)\\frac{dP_{maj+}}{dp}$.\n\nWe need to compute $\\frac{dP_{maj+}}{dp}$.\n$$ \\frac{dP_{maj+}}{dp} = \\frac{d}{dp} \\sum_{k=(r+1)/2}^{r} \\binom{r}{k} p^k (1-p)^{r-k} $$\nIt is a known result that this derivative simplifies due to a telescoping sum property:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dp} \\sum_{k=K}^{r} \\binom{r}{k} p^k (1-p)^{r-k} = r\\binom{r-1}{K-1} p^{K-1}(1-p)^{r-K} $$\nIn our case, $K=\\frac{r+1}{2}$. So, $K-1 = \\frac{r-1}{2}$ and $r-K = r - \\frac{r+1}{2} = \\frac{r-1}{2}$.\n$$ \\frac{dP_{maj+}}{dp} = r \\binom{r-1}{(r-1)/2} p^{(r-1)/2} (1-p)^{(r-1)/2} $$\nWe evaluate this at $m=0$, which corresponds to $p=1/2$.\n$$ \\left. \\frac{dP_{maj+}}{dp} \\right|_{p=1/2} = r \\binom{r-1}{(r-1)/2} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{(r-1)/2} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{(r-1)/2} = r \\binom{r-1}{(r-1)/2} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{r-1} $$\nNow we can compute $F'(0)$:\n$$ F'(0) = (1-2q) \\left. \\frac{dP_{maj+}}{dp} \\right|_{p=1/2} = (1-2q) r \\binom{r-1}{(r-1)/2} \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{r-1} $$\nSince $r \\ge 3$ and $q \\in [0,1]$, $F(m)$ is an increasing function of $m$ for $m$ near $0$ when $q < 1/2$. Therefore, $F'(0) \\ge 0$, and the stability condition is $F'(0) = 1$. The critical fraction $q_c(r)$ is the value of $q$ that satisfies this condition.\n$$ 1 = (1-2q_c) r \\binom{r-1}{(r-1)/2} 2^{-(r-1)} $$\nSolving for $q_c$:\n$$ 1-2q_c = \\frac{2^{r-1}}{r \\binom{r-1}{(r-1)/2}} $$\n$$ 2q_c = 1 - \\frac{2^{r-1}}{r \\binom{r-1}{(r-1)/2}} $$\n$$ q_c(r) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 1 - \\frac{2^{r-1}}{r \\binom{r-1}{(r-1)/2}} \\right) $$\nThis expression can be slightly simplified:\n$$ q_c(r) = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{2^{r-2}}{r \\binom{r-1}{(r-1)/2}} $$\nFor $q > q_c(r)$, we have $1-2q < 1-2q_c$, which implies $F'(0) < 1$. In this regime, the disordered state $m^*=0$ is stable, and any small deviation from $m=0$ will decay. Thus, consensus is impossible. This matches the condition specified in the problem.\nThe final closed-form expression for the critical contrarian fraction is therefore as derived.",
