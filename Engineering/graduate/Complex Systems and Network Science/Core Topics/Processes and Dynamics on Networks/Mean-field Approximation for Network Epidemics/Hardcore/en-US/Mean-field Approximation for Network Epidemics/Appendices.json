This exercise guides you through the generating function formalism, a cornerstone technique that connects the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model to the theory of bond percolation on networks .

            "problem": "Consider a large, sparse random network generated by the configuration model, where the degree distribution is $P(k)$ with $P(3)=1$ and $P(k)=0$ for all $k \\neq 3$. A Susceptible–Infected–Recovered (SIR) epidemic unfolds on this network with edge-level transmissibility $\\mathcal{T}$, meaning that each infectious contact across an edge independently transmits with probability $\\mathcal{T}$ and otherwise fails to transmit. Assume the network is locally tree-like and that the mean-field generating function approach for configuration-model networks applies.\n\nUsing only first principles for configuration-model networks and the mapping of final SIR epidemic size to bond percolation on the network, determine the final epidemic size $R_{\\infty}$ as the fraction of the population that ultimately becomes infected and then recovers.

Evaluate your result for $\\mathcal{T} = 0.6$.\n\nExpress your final answer as a pure number with no units, and round to six significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the final size of a Susceptible–Infected–Recovered (SIR) epidemic on a 3-regular random network, which is a network where every node has a degree of $k=3$. The analysis will be performed using the mean-field generating function approach, leveraging the mapping between the final state of an SIR epidemic and bond percolation.\n\nFirst, we define the generating functions associated with the network's degree distribution, $P(k)$. The problem states that the network is generated by the configuration model with $P(3)=1$ and $P(k)=0$ for all $k \\neq 3$.\n\nThe generating function for the degree distribution, $G_0(x)$, is defined as $G_0(x) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} P(k) x^k$. For the given distribution, this becomes:\n$$\nG_0(x) = P(3)x^3 = 1 \\cdot x^3 = x^3\n$$\n\nThe generating function for the excess degree distribution, $G_1(x)$, describes the distribution of the number of outgoing edges from a node reached by traversing a random edge. It is defined as $G_1(x) = \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{k P(k)}{\\langle k \\rangle} x^{k-1}$. First, we calculate the mean degree $\\langle k \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\langle k \\rangle = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} k P(k) = 3 \\cdot P(3) = 3 \\cdot 1 = 3\n$$\nSubstituting this into the definition of $G_1(x)$:\n$$\nG_1(x) = \\frac{3 P(3)}{\\langle k \\rangle} x^{3-1} = \\frac{3 \\cdot 1}{3} x^2 = x^2\n$$\n\nThe final size of the SIR epidemic, $R_{\\infty}$, is equivalent to the relative size of the giant connected component (GCC) in a bond percolation process on the network. In this mapping, each edge is \"occupied\" (i.e., can transmit the infection) with probability equal to the transmissibility, $\\mathcal{T}$.\n\nLet $v$ be the probability that following a randomly chosen edge does *not* lead to the giant component of infected nodes. An edge fails to lead to the GCC if either (a) the edge is \"unoccupied\" (transmission fails), which occurs with probability $1-\\mathcal{T}$, or (b) the edge is \"occupied\" (transmission succeeds, with probability $\\mathcal{T}$), but the node at the other end does not connect to the GCC through any of its other edges.\n\nA node reached by traversing an edge has an excess degree distribution generated by $G_1(x)$. If this node has $k-1$ other edges, the probability that none of them lead to the GCC is $v^{k-1}$. Averaging over all possible excess degrees, the probability that the destination node is not connected to the GCC via its other edges is given by $\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{k P(k)}{\\langle k \\rangle} v^{k-1} = G_1(v)$.\n\nCombining these possibilities, we can write a self-consistency equation for $v$:\n$$\nv = (1 - \\mathcal{T}) + \\mathcal{T} G_1(v)\n$$\nSubstituting our expression for $G_1(x)$, we have:\n$$\nv = 1 - \\mathcal{T} + \\mathcal{T} v^2\n$$\nThis can be rearranged into a quadratic equation for $v$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{T} v^2 - v + (1 - \\mathcal{T}) = 0\n$$\nWe solve for $v$ using the quadratic formula:\n$$\nv = \\frac{-(-1) \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(\\mathcal{T})(1-\\mathcal{T})}}{2\\mathcal{T}} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 4\\mathcal{T} + 4\\mathcal{T}^2}}{2\\mathcal{T}} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{(1 - 2\\mathcal{T})^2}}{2\\mathcal{T}} = \\frac{1 \\pm |1 - 2\\mathcal{T}|}{2\\mathcal{T}}\n$$\nOne solution to this equation is always $v=1$, which corresponds to the case where no epidemic occurs (no GCC). A non-trivial epidemic is possible only if a solution $v1$ exists. This occurs when the epidemic threshold is exceeded, which for this model is $\\mathcal{T} G_1'(1)  1$. Since $G_1'(x) = 2x$, $G_1'(1) = 2$, the condition is $2\\mathcal{T}  1$, or $\\mathcal{T}  1/2 = 0.5$.\n\nThe problem specifies $\\mathcal{T} = 0.6$, which is greater than $0.5$. Thus, a non-trivial epidemic is expected. For $\\mathcal{T}  0.5$, we have $1 - 2\\mathcal{T}  0$, so $|1-2\\mathcal{T}| = -(1-2\\mathcal{T}) = 2\\mathcal{T}-1$. The two roots for $v$ are:\n$$\nv = \\frac{1 \\pm (2\\mathcal{T}-1)}{2\\mathcal{T}}\n$$\nOne root is $v_+ = \\frac{1 + 2\\mathcal{T}-1}{2\\mathcal{T}} = \\frac{2\\mathcal{T}}{2\\mathcal{T}} = 1$. The other, non-trivial, root is:\n$$\nv_- = \\frac{1 - (2\\mathcal{T}-1)}{2\\mathcal{T}} = \\frac{2 - 2\\mathcal{T}}{2\\mathcal{T}} = \\frac{1-\\mathcal{T}}{\\mathcal{T}}\n$$\nThis is the physically meaningful solution for the probability that an edge does not lead to the GCC.\n\nThe final epidemic size, $R_{\\infty}$, is the fraction of nodes in the GCC. A randomly chosen node is *not* in the GCC if none of its edges lead to the GCC. If a node has degree $k$, this probability is $v^k$. Averaging over the degree distribution $P(k)$, the probability that a random node is not in the GCC is $\\sum_k P(k) v^k = G_0(v)$. Therefore, the size of the GCC is:\n$$\nR_{\\infty} = 1 - G_0(v)\n$$\nSubstituting our expressions for $G_0(x)$ and $v$:\n$$\nR_{\\infty} = 1 - v^3 = 1 - \\left(\\frac{1-\\mathcal{T}}{\\mathcal{T}}\\right)^3\n$$\nNow we evaluate this expression for the given transmissibility $\\mathcal{T}=0.6$:\n$$\nR_{\\infty} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{1-0.6}{0.6}\\right)^3 = 1 - \\left(\\frac{0.4}{0.6}\\right)^3 = 1 - \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^3\n$$\n$$\nR_{\\infty} = 1 - \\frac{8}{27} = \\frac{27-8}{27} = \\frac{19}{27}\n$$\nTo obtain the numerical answer, we compute the value of this fraction and round to six significant figures:\n$$\nR_{\\infty} = \\frac{19}{27} \\approx 0.703703703...\n$$\nRounding to six significant figures gives $0.703704$.",

Directed transmission from node $j$ to node $i$ occurs along the directed edge with weight $w_{ji}$ at infection rate proportional to the product of a global transmission rate parameter $\\beta0$ and the weight $w_{ji}0$. Each infected node recovers independently at rate $\\mu0$. Let $p_i(t)$ denote the infection probability of node $i$ at time $t$. In the Quenched Mean Field (QMF) approximation (where node states are independent and the adjacency is fixed), the infection hazard at a susceptible node $i$ is the sum of instantaneous infection pressures along all incoming edges, each equal to $\\beta w_{ji} p_j(t)$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It describes a canonical Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model on a 2-node directed network, a standard problem in network epidemiology. All parameters and assumptions, including the use of the Quenched Mean Field (QMF) approximation, are clearly defined. The task is to derive and solve for the non-trivial steady-state probabilities and the average prevalence. The assumption that a nonzero steady state exists removes ambiguity. The problem is therefore valid for solution.\n\nWe begin by formulating the differential equations for the infection probabilities $p_1(t)$ and $p_2(t)$ of nodes $1$ and $2$, respectively, under the QMF approximation. The rate of change of the infection probability for a node $i$, $\\frac{dp_i}{dt}$, is the difference between the rate of infection and the rate of recovery.\n\nThe rate of infection for a susceptible node $i$ is its probability of being susceptible, $1-p_i(t)$, multiplied by the total infection pressure, or hazard, from its infected neighbors. The problem states this hazard is $\\sum_j \\beta w_{ji} p_j(t)$, where $\\beta$ is the global transmission rate parameter and $w_{ji}$ are the directed edge weights. The rate of recovery for an infected node $i$ is its probability of being infected, $p_i(t)$, multiplied by the recovery rate $\\mu$.\n\nThus, the general QMF equation for node $i$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dp_i}{dt} = (1-p_i(t)) \\sum_j \\beta w_{ji} p_j(t) - \\mu p_i(t)\n$$\n\nFor the specified 2-node network, the weights are $w_{21}=b$ (from node $2$ to $1$) and $w_{12}=a$ (from node $1$ to $2$), with all other weights being zero. The system of equations for $p_1(t)$ and $p_2(t)$ becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dp_1}{dt} = (1-p_1(t)) \\beta b p_2(t) - \\mu p_1(t)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dp_2}{dt} = (1-p_2(t)) \\beta a p_1(t) - \\mu p_2(t)\n$$\n\nTo find the steady-state solutions, denoted $p_1^{\\ast}$ and $p_2^{\\ast}$, we set the time derivatives to zero:\n$$\n(1-p_1^{\\ast}) \\beta b p_2^{\\ast} - \\mu p_1^{\\ast} = 0 \\quad \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\n(1-p_2^{\\ast}) \\beta a p_1^{\\ast} - \\mu p_2^{\\ast} = 0 \\quad \\quad (2)\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for the nontrivial steady state, so we assume $p_1^{\\ast} > 0$ and $p_2^{\\ast} > 0$.

This is the well-known condition for the onset of an epidemic in this system, where $\\sqrt{ab}$ is the spectral radius of the network's weighted adjacency matrix.\n\nBy symmetry, swapping the labels $(1 \\leftrightarrow 2)$ is equivalent to swapping the weights $(a \\leftrightarrow b)$. We can thus find $p_1^{\\ast}$ by interchanging $a$ and $b$ in the expression for $p_2^{\\ast}$:\n$$\np_1^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\beta^2 ba - \\mu^2}{\\beta a (\\beta b + \\mu)}\n$$\n\nNext, we compute the steady-state average prevalence $\\bar{p}^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n\\bar{p}^{\\ast} = \\frac{p_1^{\\ast} + p_2^{\\ast}}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{\\beta^2 ab - \\mu^2}{\\beta a (\\beta b + \\mu)} + \\frac{\\beta^2 ab - \\mu^2}{\\beta b (\\beta a + \\mu)} \\right]\n$$\nFactor out the common term $(\\beta^2 ab - \\mu^2)$:\n$$\n\\bar{p}^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\beta^2 ab - \\mu^2}{2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{\\beta a (\\beta b + \\mu)} + \\frac{1}{\\beta b (\\beta a + \\mu)} \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{p}^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\beta^2 ab - \\mu^2}{2\\beta} \\left[ \\frac{1}{a(\\beta b + \\mu)} + \\frac{1}{b(\\beta a + \\mu)} \\right]\n$$\nTo combine the fractions in the brackets, we use a common denominator $ab(\\beta b + \\mu)(\\beta a + \\mu)$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{a(\\beta b + \\mu)} + \\frac{1}{b(\\beta a + \\mu)} = \\frac{b(\\beta a + \\mu) + a(\\beta b + \\mu)}{ab(\\beta b + \\mu)(\\beta a + \\mu)} = \\frac{\\beta ab + b\\mu + \\beta ab + a\\mu}{ab(\\beta^2 ab + \\beta a \\mu + \\beta b \\mu + \\mu^2)}\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{2\\beta ab + \\mu(a+b)}{ab(\\beta^2 ab + \\beta\\mu(a+b) + \\mu^2)}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\bar{p}^{\\ast}$:\n$$\n\\bar{p}^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\beta^2 ab - \\mu^2}{2\\beta} \\left( \\frac{2\\beta ab + \\mu(a+b)}{ab(\\beta^2 ab + \\beta\\mu(a+b) + \\mu^2)} \\right)\n$$\nThis simplifies to the final closed-form expression:\n$$\n\\bar{p}^{\\ast} = \\frac{(\\beta^2 ab - \\mu^2)(2\\beta ab + \\mu(a+b))}{2\\beta ab(\\beta^2 ab + \\beta\\mu(a+b) + \\mu^2)}\n$$\n\nFinally, we discuss the impact of asymmetric weights. In the symmetric case where $a=b$, the probabilities are equal: $p_1^{\\ast} = p_2^{\\ast} = 1 - \\frac{\\mu}{\\beta a}$. When weights are asymmetric, say $ab$, node $1$ is a stronger spreader than node $2$. The denominators of $p_1^{\\ast}$ and $p_2^{\\ast}$ are $\\beta a (\\beta b + \\mu)$ and $\\beta b (\\beta a + \\mu)$, respectively.\nDenominator of $p_1^{\\ast}$: $\\beta^2 ab + a\\beta\\mu$.\nDenominator of $p_2^{\\ast}$: $\\beta^2 ab + b\\beta\\mu$.\nSince $ab$ and all parameters are positive, $a\\beta\\mu  b\\beta\\mu$, which implies the denominator for $p_1^{\\ast}$ is larger than that for $p_2^{\\ast}$. As the numerators are identical, this leads to $p_1^{\\ast}  p_2^{\\ast}$.\nThis is a key network effect: the node that is a stronger spreader (larger outgoing weight $a=w_{12}$) has a lower individual infection probability because it receives less infectious pressure from its weaker-spreading neighbor. Conversely, the weaker spreader (node $2$) faces a stronger infectious pressure and has a higher infection probability.\n\nRegarding the average prevalence $\\bar{p}^{\\ast}$, consider the case where the geometric mean of the weights, $\\sqrt{ab}$, is held constant. This fixes the epidemic threshold condition. The Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean inequality states that for $a,b0$, $a+b \\ge 2\\sqrt{ab}$, with equality if and only if $a=b$. Therefore, for a fixed product $ab$, the sum $a+b$ is minimized in the symmetric case. Analysis of the expression for $\\bar{p}^{\\ast}$ shows that it is a decreasing function of the sum $a+b$ (for a fixed product $ab$). Consequently, the average prevalence $\\bar{p}^{\\ast}$ is maximized in the symmetric case ($a=b$) and is reduced by any asymmetry in the weights.",

The provided numerical values are consistent with probability theory and the detailed-balance constraint. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution can be constructed.\n\n**1. Heterogeneous Mean-Field Equation and Epidemic Threshold**\n\nWe begin by deriving the rate equation for $i_k(t)$, the fraction of infected nodes of degree $k$. The change in $i_k(t)$ is governed by two processes: recovery and infection.\n- An infected node of degree $k$ recovers and becomes susceptible with a rate $\\mu$. This contributes a term $-\\mu i_k(t)$ to the rate of change.\n- A susceptible node of degree $k$ (of which there is a fraction $1-i_k(t)$) becomes infected through contact with its neighbors. The rate of infection is proportional to the infection rate $\\beta$, the number of neighbors $k$, and the probability that a randomly chosen neighbor is infected. This probability, let's call it $\\theta_k(t)$, depends on the degree of the focal node, $k$.\n\nIn the degree-based mean-field approximation, we express $\\theta_k(t)$ by averaging over the degrees of the neighbors. A neighbor of a degree-$k$ node has degree $k'$ with probability $P(k' \\mid k)$. The probability that this degree-$k'$ neighbor is infected is $i_{k'}(t)$. Summing over all possible neighbor degrees $k'$, we have:\n$$ \\theta_k(t) = \\sum_{k'} P(k' \\mid k) \\, i_{k'}(t) $$\nThe total rate at which a susceptible node of degree $k$ becomes infected is $\\beta k \\theta_k(t)$. Assuming independent infection events from neighbors, the gain term for $i_k(t)$ is $\\beta k (1-i_k(t)) \\theta_k(t)$.\n\nCombining the gain and loss terms, we obtain the full nonlinear rate equation:\n$$ \\frac{di_k}{dt} = \\beta k (1-i_k(t)) \\sum_{k'} P(k' \\mid k) \\, i_{k'}(t) - \\mu i_k(t) $$\nTo find the epidemic threshold, we analyze the stability of the disease-free equilibrium (DFE), where $i_k(t) = 0$ for all $k$. Let $i_k(t) = \\epsilon_k(t)$, where $\\epsilon_k(t)$ is a small perturbation. Substituting this into the rate equation and linearizing by dropping terms of order $\\epsilon^2$ and higher (i.e., setting $1-\\epsilon_k \\approx 1$):\n$$ \\frac{d\\epsilon_k}{dt} \\approx \\beta k \\sum_{k'} P(k' \\mid k) \\, \\epsilon_{k'}(t) - \\mu \\epsilon_k(t) $$\nThis is a system of linear ordinary differential equations. Let the distinct degrees in the network be $\\{k_1, k_2, \\dots, k_N\\}$. We can write the system in vector form $\\frac{d\\vec{\\epsilon}}{dt} = J \\vec{\\epsilon}$, where $\\vec{\\epsilon}$ is the vector of perturbations $(\\epsilon_{k_1}, \\epsilon_{k_2}, \\dots, \\epsilon_{k_N})^T$ and $J$ is the Jacobian matrix. The elements of $J$ are given by:\n$$ J_{ij} = \\beta k_i P(k_j \\mid k_i) - \\mu \\delta_{ij} $$\nwhere $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. We can express $J$ as $J = \\beta M - \\mu I$, where $I$ is the identity matrix and $M$ is a matrix with elements $M_{ij} = k_i P(k_j \\mid k_i)$.\n\nThe DFE is unstable if any eigenvalue of $J$ has a positive real part. The eigenvalues of $J$ are $\\lambda_J = \\beta \\lambda_M - \\mu$, where $\\lambda_M$ are the eigenvalues of $M$. The condition for instability is $\\max(\\text{Re}(\\lambda_J))  0$, which translates to $\\beta \\max(\\text{Re}(\\lambda_M)) - \\mu  0$. The matrix $M$ has non-negative entries, so by the Perron-Frobenius theorem, its largest eigenvalue is real and positive. This eigenvalue is the spectral radius, $\\rho(M)$. Thus, $\\max(\\text{Re}(\\lambda_M)) = \\rho(M)$.\n\nThe epidemic threshold is the critical value of the spreading rate $\\lambda = \\beta / \\mu$ where the DFE loses stability. The condition for an outbreak is $\\frac{\\beta}{\\mu} \\rho(M)  1$. The threshold condition is therefore expressed in terms of the spectral radius of the matrix $M$:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\beta}{\\mu} \\right)_c = \\frac{1}{\\rho(M)} $$\nwhere $M$ is the matrix with elements $M_{ij} = k_i P(k_j \\mid k_i)$ for the distinct degree classes $i$ and $j$.\n\n**2. Condition for Invalidity of Uncorrelated Network Threshold**\n\nThe widely used moment-based threshold for uncorrelated networks is $(\\frac{\\beta}{\\mu})_c = \\frac{\\langle k \\rangle}{\\langle k^2 \\rangle}$. This result is derived under the assumption that $P(k' \\mid k)$ is independent of $k$, specifically $P(k' \\mid k) = \\frac{k' P(k')}{\\langle k \\rangle}$, where $\\langle k \\rangle = \\sum_k k P(k)$ and $\\langle k^2 \\rangle = \\sum_k k^2 P(k)$.\n\nThe moment-based threshold is invalid whenever the network exhibits degree correlations, meaning the assumption $P(k' \\mid k) = \\frac{k' P(k')}{\\langle k \\rangle}$ does not hold for all pairs $(k, k')$. This occurs in networks with assortative mixing (where high-degree nodes preferentially connect to other high-degree nodes) or disassortative mixing (where high-degree nodes preferentially connect to low-degree nodes).\n\nThe corrected expression for the epidemic threshold under correlated mixing is precisely the one derived from the stability analysis in the previous section:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\beta}{\\mu} \\right)_c = \\frac{1}{\\rho(M)} $$\nwhere $M_{ij} = k_i P(k_j \\mid k_i)$. This expression is general and remains valid for correlated and uncorrelated networks alike, reducing to the moment-based formula in the specific case of no correlations.\n\n**3. Calculation for the Two-Class Network**\n\nWe are given a network with two degree classes, $k_1 = 2$ and $k_2 = 8$, with $P(k_1) = \\frac{4}{5}$ and $P(k_2) = \\frac{1}{5}$. The conditional probabilities are $P(k_1 \\mid k_1) = \\frac{7}{10}$ and $P(k_2 \\mid k_1) = \\frac{3}{10}$. Since $\\sum_{k'} P(k' \\mid k) = 1$, we can verify that $P(k_1 \\mid k_1) + P(k_2 \\mid k_1) = \\frac{7}{10} + \\frac{3}{10} = 1$, which is consistent.\n\nWe first determine the remaining conditional probabilities, $P(k_1 \\mid k_2)$ and $P(k_2 \\mid k_2)$, using the detailed-balance constraint: $k_1 P(k_1) P(k_2 \\mid k_1) = k_2 P(k_2) P(k_1 \\mid k_2)$.\n$$ (2) \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right) \\left(\\frac{3}{10}\\right) = (8) \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) P(k_1 \\mid k_2) $$\n$$ \\frac{24}{50} = \\frac{8}{5} P(k_1 \\mid k_2) $$\n$$ P(k_1 \\mid k_2) = \\frac{24}{50} \\cdot \\frac{5}{8} = \\frac{3}{10} $$\nUsing the normalization condition for $k=k_2$, we have $P(k_1 \\mid k_2) + P(k_2 \\mid k_2) = 1$.\n$$ P(k_2 \\mid k_2) = 1 - P(k_1 \\mid k_2) = 1 - \\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{7}{10} $$\nNow we construct the $2 \\times 2$ matrix $M$ with elements $M_{ij} = k_i P(k_j \\mid k_i)$:\n$M_{11} = k_1 P(k_1 \\mid k_1) = 2 \\cdot \\frac{7}{10} = \\frac{14}{10} = \\frac{7}{5}$\n$M_{12} = k_1 P(k_2 \\mid k_1) = 2 \\cdot \\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{6}{10} = \\frac{3}{5}$\n$M_{21} = k_2 P(k_1 \\mid k_2) = 8 \\cdot \\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{24}{10} = \\frac{12}{5}$\n$M_{22} = k_2 P(k_2 \\mid k_2) = 8 \\cdot \\frac{7}{10} = \\frac{56}{10} = \\frac{28}{5}$\n\nThe matrix $M$ is:\n$$ M = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{7}{5}  \\frac{3}{5} \\\\ \\frac{12}{5}  \\frac{28}{5} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nTo find the spectral radius $\\rho(M)$, we compute the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(M - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$ \\det \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{7}{5} - \\lambda  \\frac{3}{5} \\\\ \\frac{12}{5}  \\frac{28}{5} - \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0 $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{7}{5} - \\lambda\\right)\\left(\\frac{28}{5} - \\lambda\\right) - \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{12}{5}\\right) = 0 $$\n$$ \\lambda^2 - \\left(\\frac{7}{5} + \\frac{28}{5}\\right)\\lambda + \\frac{7 \\cdot 28}{25} - \\frac{3 \\cdot 12}{25} = 0 $$\n$$ \\lambda^2 - \\frac{35}{5}\\lambda + \\frac{196 - 36}{25} = 0 $$\n$$ \\lambda^2 - 7\\lambda + \\frac{160}{25} = 0 $$\n$$ \\lambda^2 - 7\\lambda + \\frac{32}{5} = 0 $$\nUsing the quadratic formula $\\lambda = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4(1)\\left(\\frac{32}{5}\\right)}}{2} = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{49 - \\frac{128}{5}}}{2} $$\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{245 - 128}{5}}}{2} = \\frac{7 \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{117}{5}}}{2} $$\nThe spectral radius $\\rho(M)$ is the largest eigenvalue:\n$$ \\rho(M) = \\frac{7 + \\sqrt{\\frac{117}{5}}}{2} = \\frac{7 + \\frac{\\sqrt{9 \\cdot 13}}{\\sqrt{5}}}{2} = \\frac{7 + \\frac{3\\sqrt{13}}{\\sqrt{5}}}{2} = \\frac{7 + \\frac{3\\sqrt{65}}{5}}{2} = \\frac{35 + 3\\sqrt{65}}{10} $$\nThe epidemic threshold is the reciprocal of the spectral radius:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\beta}{\\mu}\\right)_c = \\frac{1}{\\rho(M)} = \\frac{10}{35 + 3\\sqrt{65}} $$\nTo rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate $35 - 3\\sqrt{65}$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\beta}{\\mu}\\right)_c = \\frac{10(35 - 3\\sqrt{65})}{(35 + 3\\sqrt{65})(35 - 3\\sqrt{65})} = \\frac{10(35 - 3\\sqrt{65})}{35^2 - (3\\sqrt{65})^2} $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\beta}{\\mu}\\right)_c = \\frac{10(35 - 3\\sqrt{65})}{1225 - 9 \\cdot 65} = \\frac{10(35 - 3\\sqrt{65})}{1225 - 585} = \\frac{10(35 - 3\\sqrt{65})}{640} $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\beta}{\\mu}\\right)_c = \\frac{35 - 3\\sqrt{65}}{64} $$\nThis is the exact symbolic expression for the critical ratio $\\beta / \\mu$.",
