            "introduction": "A central question in network epidemiology is determining the critical condition under which a pathogen can cause a large-scale outbreak. This threshold depends intimately on the properties of both the disease and the underlying contact network. In this first practice, we tackle this question for the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model on a sparse Erdős–Rényi random graph, a foundational model for networks with random connections. By modeling the initial spread as a branching process, you will derive the classic epidemic threshold, revealing a simple but profound relationship between transmissibility and the network's average degree .",

            "problem": "Consider a Susceptible–Infectious–Recovered (SIR) process on a sparse Erdős–Rényi random graph $G(n,p)$ in the limit $n \\to \\infty$, where the mean degree is $c$ and the per-edge transmissibility is $T$, defined as the probability that infection is successfully transmitted across a single edge before recovery. Assume the standard tree-like approximation of early-time spread on sparse random graphs and that recovered individuals cannot be reinfected. Using only foundational definitions of degree distributions, size-biased sampling on edges, and the branching-process approximation for early spread, derive the condition for the emergence of a giant infected component and compute the critical transmissibility $T_c$ as a function of $c$ for the Erdős–Rényi ensemble. Express the final answer as a closed-form symbolic expression in terms of $c$.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the critical transmissibility $T_c$ for a Susceptible–Infectious–Recovered (SIR) epidemic on a sparse Erdős–Rényi (ER) random graph $G(n,p)$ with mean degree $c$. The emergence of an epidemic, where a finite fraction of the population becomes infected, is equivalent to the formation of a giant component of infected individuals. In the early stages of the outbreak, when the number of infected individuals is small compared to the total population size $n$, the spread of the disease can be accurately modeled as a branching process on the network. The network is assumed to be large and sparse, justifying the local tree-like approximation, which means we can neglect the effect of short cycles in the graph.\n\nThe condition for the branching process to grow and lead to a macroscopic outbreak is that its reproduction number, which we will denote by $\\mathcal{R}$, must be greater than $1$. This number represents the average number of new infections generated by a single infected individual in the generations following the initial one.\n\nFirst, let's characterize the underlying network. An Erdős–Rényi graph $G(n,p)$ in the sparse limit ($n \\to \\infty$, $p \\to 0$ such that $np = c$ is constant) has a degree distribution $P(k)$ that follows a Poisson distribution with mean $c$:\n$$ P(k) = \\frac{c^k \\exp(-c)}{k!} $$\nThe mean degree is, by definition, $\\langle k \\rangle = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} k P(k) = c$.\n\nThe branching process begins with a single, randomly chosen infected node (generation $0$). This node has a degree $k$ drawn from the distribution $P(k)$. It is connected to $k$ susceptible neighbors. The infection is transmitted along each of its incident edges with probability $T$, the per-edge transmissibility. The expected number of infections caused by this initial node is $\\langle k \\rangle T = cT$. However, this is not the reproduction number that governs the sustained growth of the epidemic. For the process to be self-sustaining, we must consider the number of infections caused by nodes in subsequent generations (generation $1$, $2$, etc.).\n\nAn infected node in generation $j \\geq 1$ is not a randomly chosen node from the network. Instead, it is a node that has been reached by following an edge from an infected node in generation $j-1$. The probability of reaching a node of degree $k$ by following a randomly chosen edge is proportional to its degree $k$, a phenomenon known as size-biased sampling. The degree distribution of a node found at the end of a random edge, let's call it $P_{\\text{edge}}(k)$, is given by:\n$$ P_{\\text{edge}}(k) = \\frac{k P(k)}{\\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} j P(j)} = \\frac{k P(k)}{\\langle k \\rangle} $$\nFor the ER graph, with $P(k)$ being Poisson with mean $c$, we have:\n$$ P_{\\text{edge}}(k) = \\frac{k}{\\langle k \\rangle} \\frac{c^k \\exp(-c)}{k!} = \\frac{1}{c} \\frac{c^k \\exp(-c)}{(k-1)!} = \\frac{c^{k-1} \\exp(-c)}{(k-1)!} $$\nThis is the distribution for the total degree $k$ of a node reached via an edge.\n\nNow, consider such a newly infected node. It has degree $k$. The infection arrived along one of its $k$ edges. It can now spread the infection outwards along its remaining $k-1$ edges. The quantity $k_{\\text{ex}} = k-1$ is known as the \"excess degree\". The distribution of the excess degree, $P_{\\text{ex}}(k_{\\text{ex}})$, is the distribution of $k-1$ where $k$ is drawn from $P_{\\text{edge}}(k)$:\n$$ P_{\\text{ex}}(k_{\\text{ex}}) = P_{\\text{edge}}(k_{\\text{ex}}+1) = \\frac{c^{(k_{\\text{ex}}+1)-1} \\exp(-c)}{((k_{\\text{ex}}+1)-1)!} = \\frac{c^{k_{\\text{ex}}} \\exp(-c)}{k_{\\text{ex}}!} $$\nThis shows that the excess degree distribution for a sparse ER graph is also a Poisson distribution with the same mean $c$.\n\nThe average excess degree, $\\langle k_{\\text{ex}} \\rangle$, is therefore:\n$$ \\langle k_{\\text{ex}} \\rangle = \\sum_{k_{\\text{ex}}=0}^{\\infty} k_{\\text{ex}} P_{\\text{ex}}(k_{\\text{ex}}) = c $$\nThis is the average number of *new* susceptible neighbors an infected node (from generation $j \\geq 1$) is connected to.\n\nThe reproduction number $\\mathcal{R}$ of the branching process is the expected number of secondary infections produced by a typical infected node in the cascade. This is the product of the average number of outgoing edges to susceptible neighbors, $\\langle k_{\\text{ex}} \\rangle$, and the probability of transmission along each edge, $T$.\n$$ \\mathcal{R} = \\langle k_{\\text{ex}} \\rangle T $$\nSubstituting the value of $\\langle k_{\\text{ex}} \\rangle = c$ for the ER graph, we get:\n$$ \\mathcal{R} = cT $$\nAn epidemic outbreak, corresponding to the indefinite survival of the branching process, occurs if and only if $\\mathcal{R} > 1$.\n$$ cT > 1 $$\nThe critical point, which separates the sub-epidemic regime ($\\mathcal{R} \\leq 1$) from the epidemic regime ($\\mathcal{R} > 1$), is found by setting $\\mathcal{R} = 1$. The transmissibility at this point is the critical transmissibility, $T_c$.\n$$ cT_c = 1 $$\nSolving for $T_c$ gives the condition for the emergence of a giant infected component:\n$$ T_c = \\frac{1}{c} $$\nTherefore, if the per-edge transmissibility $T$ is greater than $1/c$, a macroscopic fraction of the network will become infected. If $T$ is less than or equal to $1/c$, the outbreak will die out after affecting a vanishingly small fraction of the population in the $n \\to \\infty$ limit.",

Let's denote this fixed point as $\\mathbf{p}^* = \\mathbf{0}$.

The sums do not contain $p_i$ as a variable in the sum itself. Using the product rule on the last term:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f_i}{\\partial p_i} = -\\mu - \\beta \\left( \\sum_{j=1}^{N} A_{ij} p_j \\right)\n$$\nEvaluating at the DFE $\\mathbf{p}^* = \\mathbf{0}$ (where $p_j=0$ for all $j$):\n$$\nJ_{ii} = -\\mu - \\beta \\sum_{j=1}^{N} A_{ij} (0) = -\\mu\n$$\n\nCombining these results, the Jacobian matrix evaluated at the DFE is:\n$$\nJ_{ik} = \\beta A_{ik} - \\mu \\delta_{ik}\n$$\nwhere $\\delta_{ik}$ is the Kronecker delta. In matrix form, this is:\n$$\nJ = \\beta A - \\mu I\n$$\nwhere $A$ is the adjacency matrix of the network and $I$ is the identity matrix.\n\nThe DFE is stable if and only if all eigenvalues of $J$ have a negative real part. The stability is lost when the largest eigenvalue of $J$, denoted $\\lambda_{\\max}(J)$, becomes zero. Let the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix $A$ be $\\mu_k$. Since $J$ is a linear function of $A$, the eigenvalues of $J$ are $\\beta \\mu_k - \\mu$. The largest eigenvalue of $J$ is thus:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\max}(J) = \\beta \\lambda_{\\max}(A) - \\mu\n$$\nHere, $\\lambda_{\\max}(A)$ is the largest eigenvalue (spectral radius) of the adjacency matrix $A$. The critical point for the loss of stability occurs when $\\lambda_{\\max}(J) = 0$:\n$$\n\\beta_c \\lambda_{\\max}(A) - \\mu = 0\n$$\nThis gives the critical infection rate $\\beta_c = \\frac{\\mu}{\\lambda_{\\max}(A)}$.

Thus, the critical effective infection rate $\\tau_c$ is:\n$$\n\\tau_c = \\frac{\\beta_c}{\\mu} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\max}(A)}\n$$\n\nThe next step is to find the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix for a star network. A star network has a central hub node and $n$ peripheral leaf nodes. The total number of nodes is $N = n+1$. Let's label the hub as node $1$ and the leaves as nodes $2, \\dots, n+1$. The adjacency matrix $A$ is an $(n+1) \\times (n+1)$ symmetric matrix. The hub is connected to all $n$ leaves, and the leaves are only connected to the hub. The matrix has the form:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0  1  1  \\dots  1 \\\\\n1  0  0  \\dots  0 \\\\\n1  0  0  \\dots  0 \\\\\n\\vdots  \\vdots  \\vdots  \\ddots  \\vdots \\\\\n1  0  0  \\dots  0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis can be written in block matrix form as $A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  \\mathbf{1}_n^T \\\\ \\mathbf{1}_n  O_n \\end{pmatrix}$, where $\\mathbf{1}_n$ is the $n \\times 1$ column vector of ones and $O_n$ is the $n \\times n$ zero matrix.\n\nTo find the eigenvalues $\\mu$ of $A$, we solve the characteristic equation $A\\mathbf{v} = \\mu\\mathbf{v}$. Let the eigenvector $\\mathbf{v}$ be partitioned as $\\mathbf{v} = (v_h, \\mathbf{v}_l)^T$, where $v_h$ corresponds to the hub and $\\mathbf{v}_l$ is an $n$-dimensional vector for the leaves. The eigenvalue equation becomes:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0  \\mathbf{1}_n^T \\\\ \\mathbf{1}_n  O_n \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_h \\\\ \\mathbf{v}_l \\end{pmatrix} = \\mu \\begin{pmatrix} v_h \\\\ \\mathbf{v}_l \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis yields two equations:\n1. $\\mathbf{1}_n^T \\mathbf{v}_l = \\mu v_h$\n2. $v_h \\mathbf{1}_n = \\mu \\mathbf{v}_l$\n\nFrom equation (2), if $\\mu \\neq 0$, then all components of $\\mathbf{v}_l$ must be equal. Let $v_l$ be this common value, so $\\mathbf{v}_l = v_l \\mathbf{1}_n$ and $v_h = \\mu v_l$.\nSubstituting this into equation (1):\n$$\n\\mathbf{1}_n^T (v_l \\mathbf{1}_n) = \\mu (\\mu v_l)\n$$\n$$\nn v_l = \\mu^2 v_l\n$$\nSince we are looking for a non-trivial eigenvector, $v_l \\neq 0$. Therefore, we can divide by $v_l$:\n$$\n\\mu^2 = n \\implies \\mu = \\pm\\sqrt{n}\n$$\nThis gives two eigenvalues: $\\mu_1 = \\sqrt{n}$ and $\\mu_2 = -\\sqrt{n}$.\n\nIf $\\mu = 0$, equation (2) gives $v_h \\mathbf{1}_n = \\mathbf{0}$, which implies $v_h=0$. Equation (1) then becomes $\\mathbf{1}_n^T \\mathbf{v}_l = 0$, which means the sum of the components of $\\mathbf{v}_l$ is zero. The space of vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ satisfying this condition has dimension $n-1$. Thus, $\\mu=0$ is an eigenvalue with multiplicity $n-1$.\n\nThe full spectrum of the adjacency matrix of the star network is $\\{\\sqrt{n}, -\\sqrt{n}, 0, \\dots, 0\\}$, where $0$ has a multiplicity of $n-1$. The largest eigenvalue is clearly:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\max}(A) = \\sqrt{n}\n$$\n\nFinally, we substitute this into our expression for the critical threshold:\n$$\n\\tau_c = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\max}(A)} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\n$$\nThis is the critical effective infection rate at which the disease-free equilibrium of the NIMFA-SIS model on a star network with $n$ leaves loses its stability.",
