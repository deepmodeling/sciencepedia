However, this local view can be misleading, as it fails to capture a node's overall position within the network. This exercise  uses a simple path graph to demonstrate how two nodes with identical degrees can have vastly different global importance, introducing closeness centrality as a more sophisticated measure based on a node's average distance to all others.",

            "solution": "First, let's formally describe the graph $G=(V, E)$. The set of vertices is $V = \\{v_0, v_1, \\dots, v_9\\} \\cup \\{w_1, w_2, w_3\\}$. The total number of vertices is $n = 13$. The edges are $E = \\{\\{v_i, v_{i+1}\\} | i = 0, \\dots, 8\\} \\cup \\{\\{v_0, w_j\\} | j=1, 2, 3\\}$. This is a tree, as it is connected and has $12 = n-1$ edges. The distance $d(u,v)$ between two vertices $u$ and $v$ is the number of edges on the unique shortest path between them.\n\n**Part 1: Closeness Centrality**\n\nThe closeness centrality of a vertex $u$ is defined as $C_C(u) = \\frac{n-1}{\\sum_{v \\neq u} d(u,v)}$. Maximizing $C_C(u)$ is equivalent to minimizing the total distance from $u$ to all other vertices, $S_d(u) = \\sum_{v \\neq u, v \\in V} d(u,v)$.\n\nWe first derive a general expression for $S_d(v_m)$ for a vertex $v_m$ on the path, where $m \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 9\\}$. The sum of distances can be decomposed into the sum of distances to other path vertices and the sum of distances to the pendant vertices.\n\nThe distance from $v_m$ to another path vertex $v_i$ is $d(v_m, v_i) = |m-i|$. The sum of these distances is:\n$$ \\sum_{i=0, i \\neq m}^{9} d(v_m, v_i) = \\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} (m-i) + \\sum_{i=m+1}^{9} (i-m) $$\nThe first sum is a sum of an arithmetic progression: $\\sum_{k=1}^{m} k = \\frac{m(m+1)}{2}$.\nThe second sum is also: $\\sum_{k=1}^{9-m} k = \\frac{(9-m)(10-m)}{2}$.\nSo, the sum of distances to other path vertices is $\\frac{m(m+1)}{2} + \\frac{(9-m)(10-m)}{2}$.\n\nThe distance from $v_m$ to any pendant vertex $w_j$ is $d(v_m, w_j) = d(v_m, v_0) + d(v_0, w_j) = m + 1$. Since there are $3$ such vertices, this part of the sum is $3(m+1)$.\n\nCombining these, the total distance from $v_m$ is:\n$$ S_d(v_m) = \\frac{m(m+1)}{2} + \\frac{(9-m)(10-m)}{2} + 3(m+1) $$\n$$ S_d(v_m) = \\frac{1}{2}(m^2+m) + \\frac{1}{2}(90 - 19m + m^2) + 3m + 3 $$\n$$ S_d(v_m) = \\frac{1}{2}(2m^2 - 18m + 90) + 3m + 3 = m^2 - 9m + 45 + 3m + 3 $$\n$$ S_d(v_m) = m^2 - 6m + 48 $$\nThis is the required expression. To find the vertex $v_m$ that minimizes this sum, we find the minimum of the quadratic function $f(m) = m^2 - 6m + 48$. The vertex of this parabola occurs at $m = -\\frac{-6}{2(1)} = 3$. Since $m$ must be an integer, $m=3$ is the minimizer among the path vertices. The minimum sum is $S_d(v_3) = (3)^2 - 6(3) + 48 = 9 - 18 + 48 = 39$.\n\nNext, we must consider the pendant vertices. By symmetry, they all have the same sum of distances. Let's calculate $S_d(w_1)$:\nThe set of vertices other than $w_1$ is $\\{w_2, w_3\\} \\cup \\{v_0, \\dots, v_9\\}$.\n$d(w_1, w_2) = d(w_1, v_0) + d(v_0, w_2) = 1+1=2$. Similarly, $d(w_1, w_3) = 2$.\n$d(w_1, v_i) = d(w_1, v_0) + d(v_0, v_i) = 1+i$.\nSo, the sum of distances is:\n$$ S_d(w_1) = d(w_1, w_2) + d(w_1, w_3) + \\sum_{i=0}^{9} d(w_1, v_i) $$\n$$ S_d(w_1) = 2 + 2 + \\sum_{i=0}^{9} (1+i) = 4 + \\sum_{k=1}^{10} k = 4 + \\frac{10(11)}{2} = 4+55 = 59 $$\nComparing the minimum sum for a path vertex, $S_d(v_3)=39$, with the sum for a pendant vertex, $S_d(w_1)=59$, we find that $S_d(v_3)$ is the global minimum. Therefore, the vertex that maximizes closeness centrality is $v_3$.\n\nThe closeness centrality of $v_3$ is:\n$$ C_C(v_3) = \\frac{n-1}{S_d(v_3)} = \\frac{13-1}{39} = \\frac{12}{39} = \\frac{4}{13} $$\n\n**Part 2: Harmonic Centrality**\n\nThe harmonic centrality of a vertex $u$ is defined as $C_H(u) = \\sum_{v \\neq u, v \\in V} \\frac{1}{d(u,v)}$. We seek the vertex that maximizes this sum.\n\nWe first derive an expression for $C_H(v_m)$ for a path vertex $v_m$, $m \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 9\\}$.\n$$ C_H(v_m) = \\sum_{i=0, i \\neq m}^{9} \\frac{1}{d(v_m, v_i)} + \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\frac{1}{d(v_m, w_j)} $$\nThe first sum is $\\sum_{i=0, i \\neq m}^{9} \\frac{1}{|m-i|} = \\sum_{k=1}^{m} \\frac{1}{k} + \\sum_{k=1}^{9-m} \\frac{1}{k} = H_m + H_{9-m}$, where $H_k$ is the $k$-th harmonic number, and we use the convention $H_0 = 0$.\nThe second sum is $\\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\frac{1}{m+1} = \\frac{3}{m+1}$.\nThus, the harmonic centrality of $v_m$ is:\n$$ C_H(v_m) = H_m + H_{9-m} + \\frac{3}{m+1} $$\nTo find the maximum, we analyze the behavior of this function for $m \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 9\\}$. The term $\\frac{3}{m+1}$ is strictly decreasing as $m$ increases. The term $H_m + H_{9-m}$ is symmetric about $m=4.5$ and has its maximum values at the endpoints $m=0$ and $m=9$ ($H_0+H_9 = H_9$ and $H_9+H_0 = H_9$). The sum of these two terms will therefore be a decreasing function of $m$. The maximum must occur at $m=0$. Let's calculate $C_H(v_0)$:\n$$ C_H(v_0) = H_0 + H_9 + \\frac{3}{0+1} = 0 + H_9 + 3 $$\nThe $9$-th harmonic number is $H_9 = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{5} + \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{9} = \\frac{7129}{2520}$.\n$$ C_H(v_0) = 3 + \\frac{7129}{2520} = \\frac{3 \\times 2520 + 7129}{2520} = \\frac{7560 + 7129}{2520} = \\frac{14689}{2520} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the harmonic centrality for a pendant vertex, say $w_1$.\n$$ C_H(w_1) = \\frac{1}{d(w_1, w_2)} + \\frac{1}{d(w_1, w_3)} + \\sum_{i=0}^{9} \\frac{1}{d(w_1, v_i)} $$\n$$ C_H(w_1) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\sum_{i=0}^{9} \\frac{1}{1+i} = 1 + \\sum_{k=1}^{10} \\frac{1}{k} = 1 + H_{10} $$\n$H_{10} = H_9 + \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{7129}{2520} + \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{7129 + 252}{2520} = \\frac{7381}{2520}$.\n$$ C_H(w_1) = 1 + \\frac{7381}{2520} = \\frac{2520 + 7381}{2520} = \\frac{9901}{2520} $$\nTo find the vertex with the maximum harmonic centrality, we compare $C_H(v_0) = \\frac{14689}{2520} \\approx 5.829$ with $C_H(w_1) = \\frac{9901}{2520} \\approx 3.929$. Since $C_H(v_m)$ is a decreasing function of $m$, it is clear that $C_H(v_0)$ is the maximum value.\nThus, the vertex that maximizes harmonic centrality is $v_0$.\n\n**Demonstration and Conclusion**\n\nThe vertex maximizing closeness centrality is $v_3$, with $C_C(v_3) = \\frac{4}{13}$.\nThe vertex maximizing harmonic centrality is $v_0$, with $C_H(v_0) = \\frac{14689}{2520}$.\nSince $v_3 \\neq v_0$, we have demonstrated that the vertex maximizing closeness centrality is not the same as the vertex maximizing harmonic centrality for this tree. This phenomenon occurs because closeness centrality is sensitive to large distances, pushing its maximum away from endpoints, while harmonic centrality gives more weight to shorter distances, pulling its maximum towards vertices with many close neighbors, like the high-degree vertex $v_0$.\n\nThe final answer consists of the ordered pair of the two calculated maximum centrality values (closeness, harmonic).\n- Maximum closeness centrality (for $v_3$): $\\frac{4}{13}$\n- Maximum harmonic centrality (for $v_0$): $\\frac{14689}{2520}$",
