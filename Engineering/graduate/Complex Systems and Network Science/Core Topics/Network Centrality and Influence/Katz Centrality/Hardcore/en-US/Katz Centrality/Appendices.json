This exercise provides a foundational check on this connection, asking you to compute a node's score in two ways: first by explicitly enumerating all weighted walks, and second by using the truncated matrix series $\\sum_k \\alpha^k (A^k \\mathbf{b})_i$. By demonstrating that these two methods yield identical results , you will build a robust intuition for what the Katz centrality formula truly represents.",

Structural Explanation for Ranking Difference**\nThe ranking of nodes $1$ and $5$ by degree centrality is determined by the number of length-$1$ walks terminating at each node. As shown by $\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{1}$, node $5$ receives three length-$1$ walks (from nodes $2$, $3$, $4$) while node $1$ receives only one (from node $5$). This gives node $5$ a higher degree centrality.\n\nThe attenuated walk-based centrality accounts for longer paths. The crucial difference arises from the second-order walk contributions, which are captured by the term $\\alpha^{2}\\mathbf{A}^{2}\\mathbf{1}$. From our calculation, the vector of total length-$2$ walks is $\\mathbf{A}^{2}\\mathbf{1}=(3, 0, 0, 0, 0)^{T}$. This shows that there are three walks of length $2$ that terminate at node $1$, but there are zero walks of length $2$ that terminate at node $5$.\n\nStructurally, node $1$ acts as a \"second-order\" destination for the nodes that feed into node $5$. The three distinct walks of length $2$ ending at node $1$ are $2 \\to 5 \\to 1$, $3 \\to 5 \\to 1$, and $4 \\to 5 \\to 1$. These walks contribute a term $3\\alpha^{2}$ to the centrality of node $1$. In contrast, node $5$ receives its a high number of length-$1$ walks from nodes $2, 3, 4$, which are source nodes (in-degree of $0$). Consequently, there are no paths of length $2$ leading into node $5$.\n\nWhile node $5$ is a more important local hub (higher in-degree), node $1$ aggregates influence from two-step neighbors. The walk-based centrality captures this non-local influence. The term $3\\alpha^2$ boosts the centrality of node $1$, while the centrality of node $5$ gets no such second-order bonus. For a sufficiently large value of $\\alpha$ (specifically, for $\\alpha  \\frac{2}{3}$), this second-order effect for node $1$ is strong enough to overcome the first-order advantage of node $5$, leading to a reversal in their centrality ranking compared to simple in-degree.",

            "problem": "Consider a directed network on four nodes with adjacency matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{4 \\times 4}$ given by\n$$\nA \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix}\n0  1  1  0 \\\\\n0  0  1  1 \\\\\n0  0  0  1 \\\\\n0  1  0  0\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nAssume an influence-propagation model in which the contribution of a walk of length $\\ell$ is attenuated by a factor $\\alpha^{\\ell}$, with attenuation parameter $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{5}$, and where each node has a homogeneous exogenous activity baseline represented by the vector $\\mathbf{1} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{4}$ whose entries are all equal to $1$. In a directed network, one may quantify two distinct notions of importance:\n- receiver importance, associated with the accumulation of attenuated incoming walks terminating at a node, and\n- sender importance, associated with the accumulation of attenuated outgoing walks originating from a node.\nStarting from the walk-counting interpretation and the convention that $A_{ij}=1$ if there is an edge from node $j$ to node $i$, derive the linear systems that uniquely determine the receiver and sender importance vectors for this network as functions of $A$ and $\\alpha$. Then, solve these systems exactly for $\\alpha = \\frac{1}{5}$ to obtain both the receiver and sender importance vectors. Finally, rank the nodes from highest to lowest under each notion, and explain why the rankings differ due to the asymmetric orientation of edges in $A$. For the final numerical submission, provide the eight-tuple comprising, in order, the four receiver importance scores $(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, x_{4})$ followed by the four sender importance scores $(y_{1}, y_{2}, y_{3}, y_{4})$, expressed exactly.",
            "solution": "We first derive the linear systems that determine receiver and sender importance based on the walk-counting interpretation and the convention that $A_{ij}$ is the weight of an edge from node $j$ to node $i$.\n\n**Receiver Importance ($\\mathbf{x}$):** The receiver importance of a node $i$, $x_i$, is its baseline score (1) plus the attenuated sum of the importances of all nodes $j$ that point to it. This self-consistency condition is expressed as $x_i = 1 + \\alpha \\sum_{j=1}^N A_{ij} x_j$. In vector form, this is $\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{1} + \\alpha A \\mathbf{x}$, which yields the linear system:\n$$(I - \\alpha A) \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{1}$$\n\n**Sender Importance ($\\mathbf{y}$):** The sender importance of a node $i$, $y_i$, is determined by the attenuated sum of all walks *originating* from it. This is equivalent to calculating the receiver importance on the transposed graph (where edges are reversed), which is represented by the matrix $A^T$. The corresponding linear system is:\n$$(I - \\alpha A^T) \\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{1}$$\nFor these solutions to be valid, the underlying geometric series must converge, which requires $\\alpha  1/\\rho(A)$. The characteristic polynomial of $A$ is $\\det(A - \\lambda I) = \\lambda(\\lambda^3 - \\lambda - 1)$. Its roots give the eigenvalues, and the largest in magnitude is the spectral radius, $\\rho(A) \\approx 1.3247$. The condition $\\alpha = 1/5 = 0.2  1/1.3247 \\approx 0.755$ is satisfied.\n\nNow, we solve these systems for the given network with $A$ and $\\alpha = 1/5$.\n\nFor the receiver importance vector $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4)^T$, we solve $(I - \\frac{1}{5} A) \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{1}$:\n$$I - \\frac{1}{5}A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  -1/5  -1/5  0 \\\\ 0  1  -1/5  -1/5 \\\\ 0  0  1  -1/5 \\\\ 0  -1/5  0  1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThis is a system of equations that can be solved by back-substitution. The solution is:\n$x_4 = \\frac{155}{119}$, $x_3 = \\frac{150}{119}$, $x_2 = \\frac{180}{119}$, $x_1 = \\frac{185}{119}$.\nSo, $\\mathbf{x} = \\frac{1}{119} \\begin{pmatrix} 185 \\\\ 180 \\\\ 150 \\\\ 155 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nFor the sender importance vector $\\mathbf{y} = (y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4)^T$, we solve $(I - \\frac{1}{5} A^T) \\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{1}$:\n$$I - \\frac{1}{5}A^T = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  0  0 \\\\ -1/5  1  0  -1/5 \\\\ -1/5  -1/5  1  0 \\\\ 0  -1/5  -1/5  1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThis system of equations can also be solved by substitution. The solution is:\n$y_1 = \\frac{119}{119} = 1$, $y_2 = \\frac{181}{119}$, $y_3 = \\frac{179}{119}$, $y_4 = \\frac{191}{119}$.\nSo, $\\mathbf{y} = \\frac{1}{119} \\begin{pmatrix} 119 \\\\ 181 \\\\ 179 \\\\ 191 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nFinally, we rank the nodes and explain the differences.\n**Receiver importance ranking (from highest to lowest):**\nNode 1 ($185/119$), Node 2 ($180/119$), Node 4 ($155/119$), Node 3 ($150/119$).\nThis ranking reflects a node's ability to accumulate influence. According to the matrix $A$, the edges are $2\\to1, 3\\to1, 3\\to2, 4\\to2, 4\\to3, 2\\to4$. Node 1 is the top receiver as it is the only node with an in-degree of 2, receiving influence from nodes 2 and 3. Node 2 is the second-best receiver, getting influence from nodes 3 and 4. The scores reflect the full set of recursive dependencies in this highly interconnected graph.\n\n**Sender importance ranking (from highest to lowest):**\nNode 4 ($191/119$), Node 2 ($181/119$), Node 3 ($179/119$), Node 1 ($119/119$).\nThis ranking reflects a node's ability to broadcast influence. Node 4 is the top sender as it has an out-degree of 2, pointing to nodes 2 and 3, which are themselves important nodes. Node 1 has an out-degree of 0, so it initiates no walks and its sender score is just its baseline value of 1.\n\nThe rankings differ because the network is directed ($A \\neq A^T$). Receiver scores depend on the incoming link structure (governed by $A$), while sender scores depend on the outgoing link structure (governed by $A^T$). Node 1, with the highest in-degree, is the best receiver but, with zero out-degree, is the worst sender. Conversely, nodes like 4 and 2 are strong senders because they have high out-degrees and connect to central parts of the network.",
