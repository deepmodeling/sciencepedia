            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of the linear time-invariant system $\\dot{x} = A x$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$, with the matrix $A$ given by\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} -2  1 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe analysis will proceed from first principles, beginning with the determination of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of $A$, which govern the system's behavior.\n\nThe matrix $A$ is upper triangular, so its eigenvalues are its diagonal entries. Let the eigenvalues be $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$.\n$$\n\\lambda_1 = -2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\lambda_2 = -1.\n$$\nBoth eigenvalues are real and negative.\n\nNext, we find the corresponding eigenvectors. An eigenvector $v$ associated with an eigenvalue $\\lambda$ satisfies the equation $(A - \\lambda I)v = 0$.\n\nFor $\\lambda_1 = -2$:\n$$\n(A - \\lambda_1 I)v_1 = \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} -2  1 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} -2  0 \\\\ 0  -2 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) v_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\\\ 0  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_{1,1} \\\\ v_{1,2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThis matrix equation yields the scalar equation $v_{1,2} = 0$. The component $v_{1,1}$ can be any non-zero real number. We choose $v_{1,1} = 1$. The eigenvector corresponding to $\\lambda_1 = -2$ is thus\n$$\nv_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe eigenspace is $E_1 = \\text{span}\\{v_1\\}$.\n\nFor $\\lambda_2 = -1$:\n$$\n(A - \\lambda_2 I)v_2 = \\left( \\begin{pmatrix} -2  1 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} -1  0 \\\\ 0  -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\right) v_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} -1  1 \\\\ 0  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v_{2,1} \\\\ v_{2,2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThis gives the equation $-v_{2,1} + v_{2,2} = 0$, or $v_{2,1} = v_{2,2}$. We choose $v_{2,1} = 1$, so $v_{2,2}=1$. The eigenvector corresponding to $\\lambda_2 = -1$ is\n$$\nv_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe eigenspace is $E_2 = \\text{span}\\{v_2\\}$.\n\nWith the eigenvalues and eigenvectors determined, we can address the specific questions.\n\n**Stable and Unstable Subspaces**\nThe stable subspace, denoted $E^s$, is the linear subspace spanned by the eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues with negative real parts. The unstable subspace, $E^u$, is spanned by eigenvectors corresponding to eigenvalues with positive real parts.\nIn this system, both eigenvalues $\\lambda_1 = -2$ and $\\lambda_2 = -1$ are negative. Therefore, both associated eigenspaces $E_1$ and $E_2$ contribute to the stable subspace.\n$$\nE^s = E_1 \\oplus E_2 = \\text{span}\\{v_1, v_2\\} = \\mathbb{R}^2.\n$$\nSince there are no eigenvalues with positive real parts, the unstable subspace is the trivial subspace:\n$$\nE^u = \\{0\\}.\n$$\n\n**Attractor Status of the Origin**\nThe general solution to the system for an initial condition $x(0)$ can be expressed as a linear combination of the modes associated with each eigenvalue-eigenvector pair:\n$$\nx(t) = c_1 \\exp(\\lambda_1 t) v_1 + c_2 \\exp(\\lambda_2 t) v_2 = c_1 \\exp(-2t) \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} + c_2 \\exp(-t) \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nThe constants $c_1$ and $c_2$ are determined by the initial condition $x(0)$. An attractor is a set that attracts all trajectories from a neighborhood. For the origin to be an attractor, we must have $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} x(t) = 0$ for all $x(0)$ in a neighborhood of the origin. For a linear system, this is equivalent to checking for all $x(0) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2$.\nAs $t \\to \\infty$, both exponential terms $\\exp(-2t)$ and $\\exp(-t)$ approach $0$. Consequently, for any finite constants $c_1$ and $c_2$, both terms in the sum for $x(t)$ decay to the zero vector.\n$$\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} x(t) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\left( c_1 \\exp(-2t) v_1 + c_2 \\exp(-t) v_2 \\right) = 0 \\cdot v_1 + 0 \\cdot v_2 = 0.\n$$\nThis can also be seen from the matrix exponential. The eigenvalues of $\\exp(tA)$ are $\\exp(t\\lambda_i)$. Since both $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$ are negative, $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\exp(t\\lambda_i) = 0$. This implies $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\exp(tA) = 0_M$, where $0_M$ is the zero matrix. Thus, $\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} x(t) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\exp(tA) x(0) = 0_M x(0) = 0$.\nSince all trajectories converge to the origin, the origin is a globally asymptotically stable fixed point. Therefore, the origin $\\{0\\}$ is an attractor.\n\n**Asymptotic Exponential Rate $\\lambda_{*}$**\nWe are asked to compute the asymptotic exponential rate for generic initial conditions:\n$$\n\\lambda(x(0)) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{t} \\ln \\|x(t)\\|.\n$$\nA generic initial condition $x(0)$ is one that does not lie on any special, lower-dimensional subspace. In this case, the state space is $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and the special subspaces are the eigenspaces $E_1$ and $E_2$, which are lines. A generic initial condition can be written as $x(0) = c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2$ with both $c_1 \\neq 0$ and $c_2 \\neq 0$. The set of points for which $c_2=0$ is the line $E_1$, a set of measure zero in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Therefore, a generic initial condition has $c_2 \\neq 0$.\n\nThe solution is $x(t) = c_1 \\exp(-2t) v_1 + c_2 \\exp(-t) v_2$. To analyze the long-time behavior, we factor out the slowest decaying term, which is $\\exp(-t)$:\n$$\nx(t) = \\exp(-t) \\left( c_1 \\exp(-t) v_1 + c_2 v_2 \\right).\n$$\nNow, we take the norm. The final result is independent of the specific norm chosen, as all norms on $\\mathbb{R}^n$ are equivalent.\n$$\n\\|x(t)\\| = \\|\\exp(-t) \\left( c_1 \\exp(-t) v_1 + c_2 v_2 \\right)\\| = \\exp(-t) \\|c_1 \\exp(-t) v_1 + c_2 v_2\\|.\n$$\nAs $t \\to \\infty$, the term $c_1 \\exp(-t) v_1$ approaches the zero vector, while $c_2 v_2$ remains constant.\n$$\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\|c_1 \\exp(-t) v_1 + c_2 v_2\\| = \\|0 + c_2 v_2\\| = |c_2| \\|v_2\\|.\n$$\nSince the initial condition is generic, $c_2 \\neq 0$, and since $v_2$ is a non-zero eigenvector, $|c_2| \\|v_2\\|$ is a finite, positive constant. Let's call this constant $K$.\nNow we can compute the limit for $\\lambda(x(0))$:\n$$\n\\lambda(x(0)) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{t} \\ln \\left( \\exp(-t) \\|c_1 \\exp(-t) v_1 + c_2 v_2\\| \\right).\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms:\n$$\n\\lambda(x(0)) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{t} \\left( \\ln(\\exp(-t)) + \\ln(\\|c_1 \\exp(-t) v_1 + c_2 v_2\\|) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda(x(0)) = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\left( \\frac{-t}{t} + \\frac{\\ln(\\|c_1 \\exp(-t) v_1 + c_2 v_2\\|)}{t} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda(x(0)) = -1 + \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\ln(\\|c_1 \\exp(-t) v_1 + c_2 v_2\\|)}{t}.\n$$\nAs established, the term inside the logarithm approaches the constant $K = |c_2| \\|v_2\\|$. The limit becomes:\n$$\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{\\ln(K)}{t} = 0.\n$$\nTherefore, for any generic initial condition, the asymptotic exponential rate is:\n$$\n\\lambda(x(0)) = -1 + 0 = -1.\n$$\nThis common value is $\\lambda_{*}$. The rate of decay of a generic trajectory is governed by the eigenvalue with the largest real part, which in this case is $\\lambda_2 = -1$.\nThe final answer is $\\lambda_{*} = -1.",

Equilibrium Points and Stability**\nEquilibrium points, denoted by $x^*$, are solutions to $\\dot{x} = 0$.\n$$ -x + x^3 = 0 $$\n$$ x(x^2 - 1) = 0 $$\n$$ x(x - 1)(x + 1) = 0 $$\nThe equilibrium points are $x^*_1 = -1$, $x^*_2 = 0$, and $x^*_3 = 1$.\n\nTo analyze the stability, we examine the sign of $\\dot{x} = f(x)$ in the intervals between the equilibria:\n- For $x  1$ (e.g., $x=2$), $\\dot{x} = 2^3 - 2 = 6  0$. Trajectories move to the right, away from $x=1$.\n- For $x \\in (0, 1)$ (e.g., $x=0.5$), $\\dot{x} = (0.5)^3 - 0.5 = 0.125 - 0.5 = -0.375  0$. Trajectories move to the left, towards $x=0$.\n- For $x \\in (-1, 0)$ (e.g., $x=-0.5$), $\\dot{x} = (-0.5)^3 - (-0.5) = -0.125 + 0.5 = 0.375  0$. Trajectories move to the right, towards $x=0$.\n- For $x  -1$ (e.g., $x=-2$), $\\dot{x} = (-2)^3 - (-2) = -8 + 2 = -6  0$. Trajectories move to the left, away from $x=-1$.\n\nThis phase-line analysis indicates that $x^*=0$ is stable, while $x^*=-1$ and $x^*=1$ are unstable.\nWe can confirm this by linearizing the system. The derivative of $f(x)$ is $f'(x) = 3x^2 - 1$.\n- At $x^*=0$: $f'(0) = 3(0)^2 - 1 = -1  0$. The equilibrium is linearly stable, and thus locally asymptotically stable.\n- At $x^*=1$: $f'(1) = 3(1)^2 - 1 = 2  0$. The equilibrium is linearly unstable (a repeller).\n- At $x^*=-1$: $f'(-1) = 3(-1)^2 - 1 = 2  0$. The equilibrium is linearly unstable (a repeller).\n\n**2. $\\omega$-Limit Sets**\nWe must determine the $\\omega$-limit set, $\\omega(x_0)$, for every initial condition $x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The problem specifies that $\\omega(x_0)$ is the empty set if the solution does not exist for all $t \\ge 0$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the maximal interval of existence for solutions.\n- For an initial condition $|x_0|  1$, for instance $x_0  1$, the trajectory $x(t)$ is strictly increasing. For $x  \\sqrt{2}$, we have $x^2  2$, which implies $x^3  2x$, so $x^3-x  x^3 - x^3/2 = x^3/2$. Thus, for large $x$, $\\dot{x} = x^3-x$ is bounded below by a function of the form $cy^p$ with $p1$ (e.g., $\\dot{x}  x^3/2$). The solution to $\\dot{y} = y^3/2$ with $y(t_0) = x(t_0)$ is $y(t) = ( C - (t-t_0) )^{-1/2}$, which blows up in finite time. By the comparison principle for ODEs, the solution $x(t)$ must also blow up to $+\\infty$ in finite time.\n- A similar argument for $x_0  -1$ shows that $x(t)$ blows up to $-\\infty$ in finite time.\n- Therefore, for any $|x_0|  1$, the solution has a finite maximal forward existence time. According to the problem definition, the $\\omega$-limit set for these initial conditions is the empty set, $\\emptyset$.\n\nNext, consider initial conditions $|x_0| \\le 1$.\n- From the phase-line analysis, if $x_0 \\in [-1, 1]$, the trajectory $x(t)$ remains in the compact interval $[-1, 1]$ for all $t \\ge 0$. The flow points inward at the boundaries $x=\\pm 1$. Thus, solutions starting in this interval exist for all positive time.\n- If $x_0 \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$, the initial condition is an equilibrium point. The solution is constant: $x(t) = x_0$ for all $t$. The set of accumulation points is just the point itself.\n  - $\\omega(-1) = \\{-1\\}$\n  - $\\omega(0) = \\{0\\}$\n  - $\\omega(1) = \\{1\\}$\n- If $x_0 \\in (0, 1)$, the phase-line analysis showed that $\\dot{x}  0$, so $x(t)$ is a strictly decreasing function. It is bounded below by $0$. By the Monotone Convergence Theorem, the limit $\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} x(t)$ exists and equals some value $L \\in [0, 1)$. For an autonomous 1D system, the $\\omega$-limit set of a bounded trajectory must be a single equilibrium point. The only equilibrium in the interval $[0, 1)$ is $x^*=0$. Thus, $\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} x(t) = 0$, and $\\omega(x_0) = \\{0\\}$.\n- If $x_0 \\in (-1, 0)$, the phase-line analysis showed that $\\dot{x}  0$, so $x(t)$ is a strictly increasing function bounded above by $0$. By a similar argument, $\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} x(t) = 0$, and $\\omega(x_0) = \\{0\\}$.\n\nSummary of $\\omega$-limit sets:\n$$ \\omega(x_0) = \\begin{cases} \\emptyset  \\text{if } |x_0|  1 \\\\ \\{1\\}  \\text{if } x_0 = 1 \\\\ \\{0\\}  \\text{if } x_0 \\in (-1, 1) \\\\ \\{-1\\}  \\text{if } x_0 = -1 \\end{cases} $$\n\n**3. Attractors and Basins of Attraction**\nAn attractor is a compact, invariant set $A$ for which there exists a neighborhood $U$ of $A$ such that for any $x_0 \\in U$, the trajectory starting at $x_0$ converges to $A$. The basin of attraction of $A$, denoted $\\mathcal{B}(A)$, is the set of all $x_0$ such that $\\omega(x_0) \\subseteq A$. For $A$ to be an attractor, $\\mathcal{B}(A)$ must be a neighborhood of $A$.\n\n- Candidate attractor $\\{0\\}$: The set is compact and invariant. Its basin of attraction is $\\mathcal{B}(\\{0\\}) = \\{x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid \\omega(x_0) \\subseteq \\{0\\}\\}$. From our analysis, this is precisely the set of $x_0$ for which $\\omega(x_0) = \\{0\\}$, which is the open interval $(-1, 1)$. Since $(-1, 1)$ is an open set containing $0$, $\\{0\\}$ is an attractor.\n- Candidate attractor $\\{1\\}$: The set is compact and invariant. Its basin of attraction is $\\mathcal{B}(\\{1\\}) = \\{x_0 \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mid \\omega(x_0) \\subseteq \\{1\\}\\}$. This set is just $\\{1\\}$. This is not a neighborhood of $\\{1\\}$. Therefore, $\\{1\\}$ is not an attractor. It is a repelling fixed point.\n- Candidate attractor $\\{-1\\}$: Similarly, its basin of attraction is $\\{-1\\}$, which is not a neighborhood. Thus, $\\{-1\\}$ is not an attractor.\n\nThe only attractor for this system is the equilibrium point $\\{0\\}$. Its basin of attraction is the interval $(-1, 1)$.\n\n**4. Lebesgue Measure Calculation**\nThe final task is to compute the Lebesgue measure (length) of the set of initial conditions $x_0 \\in [-3,3]$ whose $\\omega$-limit set is $\\{0\\}$.\nLet this set be $S$.\n$$ S = \\{x_0 \\in [-3, 3] \\mid \\omega(x_0) = \\{0\\}\\} $$\nFrom our analysis, the set of all initial conditions in $\\mathbb{R}$ whose $\\omega$-limit set is $\\{0\\}$ is the interval $(-1, 1)$. We need to find the intersection of this set with the interval $[-3, 3]$.\n$$ S = (-1, 1) \\cap [-3, 3] = (-1, 1) $$\nThe Lebesgue measure of an interval $(a, b)$ is given by $\\mu((a, b)) = b - a$.\nFor the set $S = (-1, 1)$, the measure is:\n$$ \\mu(S) = 1 - (-1) = 2 $$\nThe Lebesgue measure of the set of initial conditions in $[-3, 3]$ whose trajectories converge to the origin is $2$.",

This is the open disk of radius $1$ plus the origin itself: $B_{\\text{origin}} = \\{\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : r(\\mathbf{x})  1\\}$.\n- **Basin of the limit cycle at $r=2$:** The set of points whose trajectories converge to the circle $r=2$. This corresponds to all initial conditions with $r  1$. This is the region exterior to the unit circle: $B_{r=2} = \\{\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : r(\\mathbf{x})  1\\}$.\nThe unstable limit cycle $r=1$ is the boundary separating these two basins.\n\n**Part (b): Basin Stability of the Origin**\n\nWe are asked to compute the basin stability $S_B$ of the origin with respect to a uniform probability distribution $\\rho$ on the disk $D_2 = \\{\\mathbf{x} : r(\\mathbf{x}) \\le 2\\}$.\nThe density is $\\rho(\\mathbf{x}) = 1/(4\\pi)$ for $\\mathbf{x} \\in D_2$ and $0$ otherwise.\nThe basin of attraction for the origin is $B_{\\text{origin}} = \\{\\mathbf{x} : r(\\mathbf{x})  1\\}$.\nBy definition, $S_B(\\text{origin};\\rho) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^2} \\chi_{B_{\\text{origin}}}(\\mathbf{x})\\,\\rho(\\mathbf{x})\\,\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x}$.\nThe integrand is non-zero only on the intersection of the support of $\\rho$ (the disk $D_2$) and the basin $B_{\\text{origin}}$. This intersection is the open disk of radius $1$, let's call it $D_1 = \\{\\mathbf{x} : r(\\mathbf{x})  1\\}$.\n$$ S_B(\\text{origin};\\rho) = \\int_{D_1} \\rho(\\mathbf{x}) \\,\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x} = \\int_{D_1} \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\,\\mathrm{d}\\mathbf{x} $$\nThis integral is the constant density multiplied by the area of the domain of integration $D_1$. The area of $D_1$ is $\\pi (1)^2 = \\pi$.\n$$ S_B(\\text{origin};\\rho) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\times \\text{Area}(D_1) = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\times \\pi = \\frac{1}{4} $$\n\n**Part (c): Local Linear Stability vs. Basin Stability**\n\nLocal linear stability of the origin is determined from the Jacobian matrix of $F(\\mathbf{x})$ evaluated at $\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{0}$. Although the term $r = \\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ is not differentiable at the origin, the vector field $F(\\mathbf{x})$ is. We can find the partial derivatives using the definition:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F_x}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{\\mathbf{0}} = \\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac{F_x(h,0) - F_x(0,0)}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac{[(|h|-1)(2-|h|)]h - 0}{h} = (-1)(2) = -2 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F_x}{\\partial y}\\bigg|_{\\mathbf{0}} = \\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac{F_x(0,h) - F_x(0,0)}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac{-h - 0}{h} = -1 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F_y}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{\\mathbf{0}} = \\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac{F_y(h,0) - F_y(0,0)}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac{h-0}{h} = 1 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F_y}{\\partial y}\\bigg|_{\\mathbf{0}} = \\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac{F_y(0,h) - F_y(0,0)}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac{[(|h|-1)(2-|h|)]h - 0}{h} = (-1)(2) = -2 $$\nThe Jacobian matrix at the origin is:\n$$ \\mathrm{D}F(\\mathbf{0}) = \\begin{pmatrix} -2  -1 \\\\ 1  -2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are found from the characteristic equation $\\det(\\mathrm{D}F(\\mathbf{0}) - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$$ (-2-\\lambda)^2 - (-1)(1) = 0 \\implies (\\lambda+2)^2 = -1 \\implies \\lambda+2 = \\pm i $$\n$$ \\lambda = -2 \\pm i $$\nThe eigenvalues are a complex conjugate pair, $\\lambda_{1,2} = -2 \\pm i$. The real parts are $\\text{Re}(\\lambda_{1,2})=-2$, which are negative. Therefore, the origin is a locally linearly stable equilibrium (a stable focus), which is consistent with our findings from the polar coordinate analysis.\n\n**Contrast:**\n- **Local Linear Stability** is determined by the properties of the vector field $F$ in an infinitesimal neighborhood of an equilibrium point. It is calculated from the Jacobian matrix at that point and is entirely independent of any probability distribution $\\rho$ on initial conditions. It tells us that trajectories starting \"close enough\" to the origin will converge to it.\n- **Basin Stability** ($S_B$) is a non-local measure. It quantifies the \"size\" of the basin of attraction, weighted by a given probability distribution $\\rho$ of initial conditions. It depends on both the global geometry of the basin of attraction and the specific choice of $\\rho$. In this system, the origin is locally stable, but its basin is finite (the disk $r  1$). The basin stability value of $1/4$ reflects that only a fraction of the initial conditions sampled from $D_2$ leads to the origin.\n\nLocal linear stability is a necessary condition for an equilibrium to be an attractor, but it provides no information about the extent of its basin. Basin stability addresses this by providing a quantitative measure of the basin's prevalence, which is crucial for understanding the system's global behavior. If we were to choose a different distribution, say $\\rho'$ uniform on the annulus $\\{\\mathbf{x} : 1.1 \\le r \\le 1.2\\}$, the basin stability of the origin would become $S_B(\\text{origin};\\rho') = 0$, even though the local linear stability (the eigenvalues of $\\mathrm{D}F(\\mathbf{0})$) would remain unchanged.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Under the uniform distribution on $D_2$, the basin stability of the origin equals $1/4$.**\nOur calculation in part (b) confirms this. The volume of the basin of attraction for the origin, restricted to the support of $\\rho$, is the area of a disk of radius $1$, which is $\\pi$. The total volume of the support of $\\rho$ is the area of a disk of radius $2$, which is $4\\pi$. The ratio of the areas is $\\pi/(4\\pi) = 1/4$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Local linear stability of the origin is determined solely by the eigenvalues of $\\mathrm{D}F(\\mathbf{0})$ and is independent of the initial-condition distribution $\\rho$; in this system, the eigenvalues have negative real parts.**\nThe first clause is correct by the definition of local linear stability. The second clause is confirmed by our calculation in part (c), where the eigenvalues were found to be $\\lambda = -2 \\pm i$, with real part $-2$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Basin stability and local linear stability are equivalent measures; if local linear stability holds, then $S_B=1$ for any distribution of initial conditions.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Local stability is a local property, while basin stability is a global, probabilistic measure. The current problem serves as a direct counterexample. The origin is locally stable, but for the given $\\rho$, $S_B = 1/4 \\ne 1$. Furthermore, local stability does not imply global stability (i.e., that the basin is the entire phase space), which would be required for $S_B=1$ for any distribution with support spanning the phase space.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Basin stability depends on the chosen distribution $\\rho$ and reflects the global geometry of basins of attraction; by changing $\\rho$, one can make the basin stability of the origin arbitrarily small while local linear stability remains unchanged.**\nThe first clause correctly describes the nature of basin stability. The second clause is also correct. As discussed in part (c), local linear stability is an intrinsic property of the vector field at the fixed point and is unaffected by $\\rho$. However, by choosing a distribution $\\rho$ whose probability mass is concentrated outside the origin's basin of attraction (i.e., in the region $r1$), we can make $S_B$ arbitrarily close to (or equal to) $0$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**",
