            "problem": "Consider a symmetric two-strategy game played on a large, well-mixed population so that interactions are random and the mean-field description applies. The payoff matrix is given by $$A=\\begin{pmatrix}a & b \\\\ c & d\\end{pmatrix},$$ where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are real constants. Let $x \\in [0,1]$ denote the fraction of the population playing strategy $1$, and $1-x$ the fraction playing strategy $2$. The expected payoff to each strategy is determined by the linear combination of payoffs against the current population state. The population evolves according to the continuous-time replicator dynamics, which equate the growth rate of a strategy’s frequency to its payoff advantage over the population mean.\n\nStarting from these definitions and the mean-field assumption, derive the one-dimensional ordinary differential equation for $x(t)$ under replicator dynamics, expressed solely in terms of $x$, $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$. Then, assuming $a-b-c+d \\neq 0$, determine the fraction $x^{*}\\in(0,1)$ corresponding to an interior equilibrium of the dynamics. Provide the final expression for $x^{*}$ as your answer. No numerical evaluation is required, and no rounding is needed.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the replicator dynamics equation for a symmetric two-strategy game and the subsequent identification of the interior equilibrium point. The analysis will proceed from first principles as defined in the problem statement.\n\nLet $x$ be the fraction of the population adopting strategy $1$, and $1-x$ be the fraction adopting strategy $2$, where $x \\in [0, 1]$. The game is defined by the payoff matrix:\n$$A = \\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$$\nHere, $a$ is the payoff for a strategy $1$ player meeting another strategy $1$ player, $b$ is the payoff for a strategy $1$ player meeting a strategy $2$ player, $c$ is for strategy $2$ vs. $1$, and $d$ is for strategy $2$ vs. $2$.\n\nFirst, we determine the expected payoff for an individual playing each strategy in a population with state $x$. Let $E_1(x)$ and $E_2(x)$ be the expected payoffs for strategy $1$ and strategy $2$, respectively. Under the mean-field assumption, individuals interact randomly.\nThe expected payoff for a strategy $1$ player is:\n$$E_1(x) = x \\cdot a + (1-x) \\cdot b$$\nThe expected payoff for a strategy $2$ player is:\n$$E_2(x) = x \\cdot c + (1-x) \\cdot d$$\n\nNext, we calculate the average payoff of the entire population, denoted by $\\bar{E}(x)$. This is the weighted average of the individual strategy payoffs:\n$$\\bar{E}(x) = x E_1(x) + (1-x) E_2(x)$$\n\nThe continuous-time replicator dynamics states that the growth rate of a strategy's frequency is equal to its payoff advantage over the population mean. For the fraction $x$ of strategy $1$ players, this is expressed as:\n$$\\frac{dx}{dt} = x \\left( E_1(x) - \\bar{E}(x) \\right)$$\n\nTo simplify this equation, we can express the payoff advantage term $E_1(x) - \\bar{E}(x)$ more directly.\n$$E_1(x) - \\bar{E}(x) = E_1(x) - \\left(x E_1(x) + (1-x) E_2(x)\\right)$$\n$$= (1-x) E_1(x) - (1-x) E_2(x)$$\n$$= (1-x) \\left( E_1(x) - E_2(x) \\right)$$\nSubstituting this back into the replicator equation gives:\n$$\\frac{dx}{dt} = x(1-x) \\left( E_1(x) - E_2(x) \\right)$$\nThis form of the equation is standard and intuitive: the rate of change of $x$ is proportional to the current proportions of both strategies, $x$ and $1-x$, and the difference in their expected payoffs.\n\nNow we compute the difference $E_1(x) - E_2(x)$:\n$$E_1(x) - E_2(x) = \\left(ax + b(1-x)\\right) - \\left(cx + d(1-x)\\right)$$\n$$= ax + b - bx - cx - d + dx$$\nGrouping terms with $x$:\n$$= (a - b - c + d)x + (b - d)$$\n\nSubstituting this expression back into the replicator equation yields the full one-dimensional ordinary differential equation for $x(t)$:\n$$\\frac{dx}{dt} = x(1-x) \\left[ (a - b - c + d)x + (b - d) \\right]$$\nThis completes the first part of the task.\n\nThe second part is to find the interior equilibrium point, $x^*$, defined as a steady-state solution where $x^* \\in (0,1)$. An equilibrium point is a value of $x$ for which the population composition does not change, i.e., $\\frac{dx}{dt} = 0$.\nSetting the replicator equation to zero:\n$$x^*(1-x^*) \\left[ (a - b - c + d)x^* + (b - d) \\right] = 0$$\nThis equation has three possible solutions for $x^*$:\n1. $x^* = 0$ (a pure strategy $2$ population)\n2. $x^* = 1$ (a pure strategy $1$ population)\n3. The value of $x^*$ that makes the term in the square brackets zero.\n\nThe interior equilibrium is the solution that is not on the boundaries of the interval $[0,1]$. Thus, we solve for the third case:\n$$(a - b - c + d)x^* + (b - d) = 0$$\n$$(a - b - c + d)x^* = d - b$$\nThe problem states that we must assume $a - b - c + d \\neq 0$, which allows us to divide by this term to find a unique solution for $x^*$:\n$$x^* = \\frac{d - b}{a - b - c + d}$$\nThis is the expression for the fraction of strategy $1$ players at the interior equilibrium point. The condition that $x^* \\in (0,1)$ implies certain relationships between the payoff parameters $a, b, c, d$, but the problem only asks for the algebraic expression for $x^*$.",

            "solution": "The analysis proceeds in two parts: first, the determination of all symmetric Nash equilibria, and second, the application of the ESS conditions to these equilibria.\n\nLet a population consist of a proportion $p$ of individuals playing strategy $S_{1}$ and a proportion $1-p$ playing strategy $S_{2}$. The expected payoff for an individual playing pure strategy $S_{1}$ in this population is given by:\n$$E(S_{1}, p) = p \\cdot A_{11} + (1-p) \\cdot A_{12} = p(2) + (1-p)(1) = 2p + 1 - p = p + 1$$\nSimilarly, the expected payoff for an individual playing pure strategy $S_{2}$ is:\n$$E(S_{2}, p) = p \\cdot A_{21} + (1-p) \\cdot A_{22} = p(3) + (1-p)(0) = 3p$$\n\n**1. Determination of Symmetric Nash Equilibria**\n\nA symmetric Nash equilibrium can be either a pure strategy or a mixed strategy.\n\n- **Pure Strategy Nash Equilibria**:\n  - Consider the pure strategy $p=1$ (population consists entirely of $S_{1}$ strategists). For this to be a NE, an $S_{1}$ player must do at least as well as any mutant, including an $S_{2}$ player. This requires $E(S_{1}, 1) \\ge E(S_{2}, 1)$.\n    We calculate:\n    $E(S_{1}, 1) = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n    $E(S_{2}, 1) = 3(1) = 3$.\n    Since $E(S_{1}, 1) < E(S_{2}, 1)$ (as $2 < 3$), a mutant $S_{2}$ strategist would achieve a higher payoff and could invade the population. Thus, $p=1$ is not a symmetric NE.\n  - Consider the pure strategy $p=0$ (population consists entirely of $S_{2}$ strategists). This is a NE if $E(S_{2}, 0) \\ge E(S_{1}, 0)$.\n    We calculate:\n    $E(S_{2}, 0) = 3(0) = 0$.\n    $E(S_{1}, 0) = 0 + 1 = 1$.\n    Since $E(S_{2}, 0) < E(S_{1}, 0)$ (as $0 < 1$), a mutant $S_{1}$ strategist would invade. Thus, $p=0$ is not a symmetric NE.\n\n- **Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium**:\n  A mixed strategy NE, denoted by $p^{\\ast} \\in (0,1)$, exists if the pure strategies comprising the mix yield equal payoffs. An individual must be indifferent to playing $S_{1}$ or $S_{2}$. This condition is $E(S_{1}, p^{\\ast}) = E(S_{2}, p^{\\ast})$.\n  $$p^{\\ast} + 1 = 3p^{\\ast}$$\n  $$1 = 2p^{\\ast}$$\n  $$p^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n  The only symmetric Nash equilibrium is the mixed strategy where the frequency of $S_{1}$ is $p^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n**2. Evaluation for Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS)**\n\nWe now test if the unique symmetric NE, $p^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}$, is an ESS. We use the provided definition. Let $p^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}$ be the resident strategy and $q \\in [0,1]$ with $q \\neq p^{\\ast}$ be the mutant strategy.\n\nThe general payoff function $\\pi(p, q)$, representing the payoff to a $p$-strategist against a $q$-strategist, is:\n$$\\pi(p, q) = p \\cdot (q A_{11} + (1-q) A_{12}) + (1-p) \\cdot (q A_{21} + (1-q) A_{22})$$\n$$\\pi(p, q) = p(2q + 1(1-q)) + (1-p)(3q + 0(1-q)) = p(q+1) + (1-p)(3q) = pq + p + 3q - 3pq$$\n$$\\pi(p, q) = p + 3q - 2pq$$\n\nNow we check the two conditions for ESS for $p^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n- **Condition 1: Resident Condition**\n  We must have $\\pi(p^{\\ast}, p^{\\ast}) \\ge \\pi(q, p^{\\ast})$ for all $q$.\n  The payoff to a mutant $q$-strategist in a population of $p^{\\ast}$-strategists is:\n  $$\\pi(q, p^{\\ast}) = \\pi(q, \\frac{1}{2}) = q + 3(\\frac{1}{2}) - 2q(\\frac{1}{2}) = q + \\frac{3}{2} - q = \\frac{3}{2}$$\n  The payoff to a resident $p^{\\ast}$-strategist against its own kind is:\n  $$\\pi(p^{\\ast}, p^{\\ast}) = \\pi(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2} + 3(\\frac{1}{2}) - 2(\\frac{1}{2})(\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{3}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}$$\n  Since $\\pi(p^{\\ast}, p^{\\ast}) = \\frac{3}{2}$ and $\\pi(q, p^{\\ast}) = \\frac{3}{2}$ for all $q$, the condition holds with equality: $\\pi(p^{\\ast}, p^{\\ast}) = \\pi(q, p^{\\ast})$.\n\n- **Condition 2: Stability-Against-Invasion Condition**\n  Since the first condition holds with equality, we must verify the second condition: $\\pi(p^{\\ast}, q) > \\pi(q, q)$ for all $q \\neq p^{\\ast}$.\n  We have $p^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}$. We must check if $\\pi(\\frac{1}{2}, q) > \\pi(q, q)$ for $q \\neq \\frac{1}{2}$.\n  Let's compute the two terms:\n  $$\\pi(p^{\\ast}, q) = \\pi(\\frac{1}{2}, q) = \\frac{1}{2} + 3q - 2(\\frac{1}{2})q = \\frac{1}{2} + 2q$$\n  $$\\pi(q, q) = q + 3q - 2q(q) = 4q - 2q^{2}$$\n  The inequality is:\n  $$\\frac{1}{2} + 2q > 4q - 2q^{2}$$\n  Rearranging the terms to one side:\n  $$2q^{2} - 2q + \\frac{1}{2} > 0$$\n  Multiplying by $2$:\n  $$4q^{2} - 4q + 1 > 0$$\n  The left-hand side is a perfect square:\n  $$(2q - 1)^{2} > 0$$\n  This inequality is true for all real numbers $q$ except where $2q - 1 = 0$, i.e., $q = \\frac{1}{2}$. Since the condition is for alternative strategies $q \\neq p^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}$, the strict inequality holds for all relevant $q$.\n\nBoth conditions for an ESS are satisfied for $p^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nTherefore, the mixed strategy where the frequency of $S_{1}$ is $p^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}$ is the unique symmetric evolutionarily stable strategy for this game.",

            "solution": "The problem presented is a standard inquiry in evolutionary game theory and is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains all necessary information to proceed. It requires the determination of an interior symmetric Nash equilibrium for a given payoff matrix and an assessment of its evolutionary stability.\n\nFirst, we determine the interior symmetric Nash equilibrium, denoted by $x^{\\ast} = (x_1, x_2, x_3)^T$. A strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium if no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy. For an interior mixed strategy Nash equilibrium in a symmetric game, the payoffs for all pure strategies that are played with non-zero probability must be equal. The strategy vector $x^{\\ast}$ must lie in the simplex $\\Delta_{3}$, meaning $x_i \\ge 0$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^{3} x_i = 1$. For an interior equilibrium, we have $x_i > 0$ for all $i$.\n\nThe expected payoff to an individual using pure strategy $i$ in a population playing mixed strategy $x$ is given by the $i$-th component of the vector $Ax$.\n$$\nA x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -x_2 + x_3 \\\\ x_1 - x_3 \\\\ -x_1 + x_2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor an interior equilibrium $x^{\\ast}$, the payoffs must be equal:\n$$\n(A x^{\\ast})_1 = (A x^{\\ast})_2 = (A x^{\\ast})_3\n$$\nThis yields the system of equations:\n$$-x_2^{\\ast} + x_3^{\\ast} = x_1^{\\ast} - x_3^{\\ast}$$\n$$x_1^{\\ast} - x_3^{\\ast} = -x_1^{\\ast} + x_2^{\\ast}$$\nAnd the constraint from the simplex:\n$$x_1^{\\ast} + x_2^{\\ast} + x_3^{\\ast} = 1$$\n\nFrom the first equation, we get $2x_3^{\\ast} = x_1^{\\ast} + x_2^{\\ast}$.\nSubstituting the simplex constraint $x_1^{\\ast} + x_2^{\\ast} = 1 - x_3^{\\ast}$, we find $2x_3^{\\ast} = 1 - x_3^{\\ast}$, which gives $3x_3^{\\ast} = 1$, or $x_3^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nBy symmetry of the equations, or by substitution, we can deduce that all components are equal. For example, substituting $x_3^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{3}$ into the second equation gives $x_1^{\\ast} - \\frac{1}{3} = -x_1^{\\ast} + x_2^{\\ast}$, so $2x_1^{\\ast} = x_2^{\\ast} + \\frac{1}{3}$. Using the simplex constraint again, $x_2^{\\ast} = 1 - x_1^{\\ast} - x_3^{\\ast} = 1 - x_1^{\\ast} - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3} - x_1^{\\ast}$. Substituting this into the previous expression, we get $2x_1^{\\ast} = (\\frac{2}{3} - x_1^{\\ast}) + \\frac{1}{3}$, which simplifies to $2x_1^{\\ast} = 1 - x_1^{\\ast}$, so $3x_1^{\\ast}=1$, and $x_1^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{3}$. Consequently, $x_2^{\\ast} = 1 - \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nThe unique interior symmetric Nash equilibrium is therefore $x^{\\ast} = (\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3})^T$.\n\nNext, we assess whether $x^{\\ast}$ is an Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS). According to the definition by Maynard Smith, a strategy $x^{\\ast}$ is an ESS if for any other strategy $y \\neq x^{\\ast}$, the following two conditions hold:\n1. $y^T A x^{\\ast} \\le (x^{\\ast})^T A x^{\\ast}$ (Equilibrium condition)\n2. If $y^T A x^{\\ast} = (x^{\\ast})^T A x^{\\ast}$, then $y^T A y < (x^{\\ast})^T A y$ (Stability condition)\n\nLet us evaluate the terms for our equilibrium $x^{\\ast}$.\nThe expected payoff in the equilibrium population is $(x^{\\ast})^T A x^{\\ast}$. First, we compute $A x^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nA x^{\\ast} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} \\\\ \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{3} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSo, the expected payoff is $(x^{\\ast})^T A x^{\\ast} = (\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}) \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = 0$.\nThe payoff for a mutant strategy $y$ in this population is $y^T A x^{\\ast} = (y_1, y_2, y_3) \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = 0$.\n\nThe first condition for an ESS is $0 \\le 0$, which is true. However, the equality $y^T A x^{\\ast} = (x^{\\ast})^T A x^{\\ast}$ holds for *every* strategy $y \\in \\Delta_3$. This means the equilibrium is neutrally stable with respect to invasion by any mutant under the first-order condition, and we must check the second condition for all $y \\neq x^{\\ast}$.\n\nThe second condition is $y^T A y < (x^{\\ast})^T A y$. Let us evaluate both sides of the inequality.\nThe left side is the quadratic form $y^T A y$. The payoff matrix $A$ is anti-symmetric, meaning $A^T = -A$. For any anti-symmetric matrix and any vector $y$, the quadratic form $y^T A y$ is identically zero. This is because $y^T A y$ is a scalar, so it is equal to its transpose: $y^T A y = (y^T A y)^T = y^T A^T y = y^T(-A)y = -y^T A y$. This implies $2 y^T A y = 0$, so $y^T A y = 0$.\n\nThe right side is $(x^{\\ast})^T A y$. Let us compute the vector $(x^{\\ast})^T A$:\n$$\n(x^{\\ast})^T A = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{3} & \\frac{1}{3} & \\frac{1}{3} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & -1 \\\\ -1 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nTherefore, $(x^{\\ast})^T A y = 0$ for any strategy $y$.\n\nSubstituting these results into the stability condition, we must check if $0 < 0$. This is a strict inequality that is false. The condition for evolutionary stability is not met. The \"curvature of payoffs\" mentioned in the problem is zero, as the payoff landscape $E(y, x^{\\ast}) = y^T A x^{\\ast}$ is flat, and the invasion exponent $y^T A y - (x^{\\ast})^T A y$ is zero, not strictly negative. Consequently, the Nash equilibrium $x^{\\ast}$ is not an ESS. It is merely neutrally stable, which in the context of replicator dynamics leads to persistent oscillations (cycles) around the equilibrium point rather than convergence to it.\n\nThe problem asks for the row vector of the equilibrium strategy as the final answer.",
