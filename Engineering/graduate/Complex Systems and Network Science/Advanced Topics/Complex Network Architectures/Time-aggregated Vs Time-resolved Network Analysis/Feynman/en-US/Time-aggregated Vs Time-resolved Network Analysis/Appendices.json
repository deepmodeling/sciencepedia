            "problem": "Consider a temporal network of instantaneous, undirected contacts on the node set $V=\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ observed over the time interval $[0,10]$.

The provided contact sequence is\n$(1,2,1)$, $(2,3,2)$, $(1,3,3)$, $(1,4,4)$, $(2,3,5)$, $(1,2,6)$, $(1,3,7)$, $(2,4,8)$.\nDefine the time-aggregated graph as the simple, undirected graph on $V$ obtained by placing an edge between nodes $i$ and $j$ if at least one contact $(i,j,t)$ occurs in the observation window.

            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of two distinct quantities related to triangle structures in a temporal network, followed by the calculation of their ratio. The first quantity is the number of static triangles in the time-aggregated graph, and the second is the number of time-respecting triangle motifs under a specific duration constraint.\n\nThe node set is given as $V = \\{1,2,3,4\\}$. The temporal network is defined by a sequence of instantaneous contacts over the time interval $[0,10]$:\n$$C = \\{(1,2,1), (2,3,2), (1,3,3), (1,4,4), (2,3,5), (1,2,6), (1,3,7), (2,4,8)\\}$$\nwhere a contact is a tuple $(i,j,t)$. For clarity, we can list the contacts in chronological order:\n$c_1 = (1,2,1)$\n$c_2 = (2,3,2)$\n$c_3 = (1,3,3)$\n$c_4 = (1,4,4)$\n$c_5 = (2,3,5)$\n$c_6 = (1,2,6)$\n$c_7 = (1,3,7)$\n$c_8 = (2,4,8)$\n\n**Part 1: Static Triangle Count**\n\nFirst, we construct the time-aggregated graph, $G_{\\text{agg}} = (V, E_{\\text{agg}})$. An edge $(i,j)$ exists in $E_{\\text{agg}}$ if there is at least one contact $(i,j,t)$ in the given sequence. By inspecting the contact list, we identify the unique interacting pairs:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Pair $\\{1,2\\}$: contacts at $t=1$ and $t=6$. Edge $(1,2) \\in E_{\\text{agg}}$.\n    \\item Pair $\\{2,3\\}$: contacts at $t=2$ and $t=5$. Edge $(2,3) \\in E_{\\text{agg}}$.\n    \\item Pair $\\{1,3\\}$: contacts at $t=3$ and $t=7$. Edge $(1,3) \\in E_{\\text{agg}}$.\n    \\item Pair $\\{1,4\\}$: contact at $t=4$. Edge $(1,4) \\in E_{\\text{agg}}$.\n    \\item Pair $\\{2,4\\}$: contact at $t=8$. Edge $(2,4) \\in E_{\\text{agg}}$.\n    \\item Pair $\\{3,4\\}$: no contacts. Edge $(3,4) \\notin E_{\\text{agg}}$.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe edge set of the aggregated graph is therefore $E_{\\text{agg}} = \\{(1,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,4), (2,4)\\}$.\n\nA static triangle is a set of three nodes $\\{a,b,c\\} \\subseteq V$ such that all three edges $(a,b)$, $(b,c)$, and $(c,a)$ are present in $E_{\\text{agg}}$. We examine all possible 3-node subsets from $V$:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Triplet $\\{1,2,3\\}$: The required edges are $(1,2)$, $(2,3)$, and $(1,3)$. All three edges are in $E_{\\text{agg}}$. Thus, $\\{1,2,3\\}$ forms a static triangle.\n    \\item Triplet $\\{1,2,4\\}$: The required edges are $(1,2)$, $(2,4)$, and $(1,4)$. All three edges are in $E_{\\text{agg}}$. Thus, $\\{1,2,4\\}$ forms a static triangle.\n    \\item Triplet $\\{1,3,4\\}$: The required edges are $(1,3)$, $(3,4)$, and $(1,4)$. The edge $(3,4)$ is not in $E_{\\text{agg}}$. This is not a triangle.\n    \\item Triplet $\\{2,3,4\\}$: The required edges are $(2,3)$, $(3,4)$, and $(2,4)$. The edge $(3,4)$ is not in $E_{\\text{agg}}$. This is not a triangle.\n\\end{enumerate}\nThe total count of static triangles is $2$.\n\n**Part 2: Temporal Triangle Motif Count**\n\nA time-respecting triangle motif is defined as a time-respecting sequence of three contacts, $(i_1,j_1,t_1), (i_2,j_2,t_2), (i_3,j_3,t_3)$, satisfying:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item The times are strictly increasing: $t_1  t_2  t_3$.\n    \\item The contacts involve the three distinct pairs of a single 3-node set $\\{a,b,c\\}$. That is, the set of edges $\\{\\{i_1,j_1\\}, \\{i_2,j_2\\}, \\{i_3,j_3\\}\\}$ is exactly $\\{\\{a,b\\}, \\{b,c\\}, \\{c,a\\}\\}$.\n    \\item The duration is bounded: $t_3 - t_1 \\leq \\tau$, where $\\tau=3$.\n\\end{enumerate}\nA temporal triangle can only exist on a set of nodes that forms a static triangle. Therefore, we only need to investigate the node triplets $\\{1,2,3\\}$ and $\\{1,2,4\\}$.\n\n**Case A: Triplet $\\{1,2,4\\}$**\nThe contacts involving these nodes are $c_1=(1,2,1)$, $c_4=(1,4,4)$, $c_6=(1,2,6)$, and $c_8=(2,4,8)$. To form a triangle on $\\{1,2,4\\}$, a sequence must include a contact on each of the pairs $\\{1,2\\}$, $\\{1,4\\}$, and $\\{2,4\\}$.\nThe only contact for edge $(2,4)$ is $c_8$ at $t=8$. Thus, for any such motif, $t_3$ must be $8$. The constraint $t_3 - t_1 \\leq 3$ implies $8 - t_1 \\leq 3$, which requires $t_1 \\geq 5$.\nHowever, the contacts available for the other two edges, $(1,2)$ and $(1,4)$, all occur before $t=5$. Specifically, we have $(1,2,1)$ and $(1,4,4)$. So, it is impossible to form a time-respecting sequence $(c_a, c_b, c_c)$ where $c_c = c_8=(2,4,8)$ and $t(c_a) \\geq 5$.\nAlternatively, consider potential sequences:\n- Sequence using $(1,2,1)$, $(1,4,4)$, $(2,4,8)$: The time-ordered sequence is $((1,2,1), (1,4,4), (2,4,8))$. Here, $t_1=1, t_2=4, t_3=8$. The duration is $t_3-t_1=7$, which is greater than $\\tau=3$.\n- Sequence using $(1,2,6)$, $(1,4,4)$, $(2,4,8)$: The time-ordered sequence is $((1,4,4), (1,2,6), (2,4,8))$. Here, $t_1=4, t_2=6, t_3=8$. The duration is $t_3-t_1=4$, which is greater than $\\tau=3$.\nTherefore, there are no time-respecting triangle motifs on the node set $\\{1,2,4\\}$.\n\n**Case B: Triplet $\\{1,2,3\\}$**\nThe contacts involving these nodes are $c_1=(1,2,1)$, $c_2=(2,3,2)$, $c_3=(1,3,3)$, $c_5=(2,3,5)$, $c_6=(1,2,6)$, and $c_7=(1,3,7)$.\nWe systematically search for ordered triplets of contacts from this subset that satisfy the conditions.\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Sequence $((1,2,1), (2,3,2), (1,3,3))$:\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item Times: $t_1=1, t_2=2, t_3=3$. These are strictly increasing.\n        \\item Edges: The contacts correspond to pairs $\\{1,2\\}$, $\\{2,3\\}$, and $\\{1,3\\}$, forming a triangle on $\\{1,2,3\\}$.\n        \\item Duration: $t_3-t_1 = 3-1=2$. Since $2 \\leq \\tau=3$, this is a valid temporal motif.\n    \\end{itemize}\n    \\item Sequence $((1,3,3), (2,3,5), (1,2,6))$:\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item Times: $t_1=3, t_2=5, t_3=6$. These are strictly increasing.\n        \\item Edges: The contacts correspond to pairs $\\{1,3\\}$, $\\{2,3\\}$, and $\\{1,2\\}$, forming a triangle on $\\{1,2,3\\}$.\n        \\item Duration: $t_3-t_1 = 6-3=3$. Since $3 \\leq \\tau=3$, this is a valid temporal motif.\n    \\end{itemize}\n    \\item Sequence $((2,3,5), (1,2,6), (1,3,7))$:\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item Times: $t_1=5, t_2=6, t_3=7$. These are strictly increasing.\n        \\item Edges: The contacts correspond to pairs $\\{2,3\\}$, $\\{1,2\\}$, and $\\{1,3\\}$, forming a triangle on $\\{1,2,3\\}$.\n        \\item Duration: $t_3-t_1 = 7-5=2$. Since $2 \\leq \\tau=3$, this is a valid temporal motif.\n    \\end{itemize}\n\\end{enumerate}\nA thorough check of all other possible combinations of three contacts on $\\{1,2,3\\}$ reveals no other sequences that satisfy all criteria.

The sequence $((2,3,2), (1,2,6), (1,3,7))$ has duration $7-2=5  3$.\nThe total count of time-respecting triangle motifs is $3$.\n\n**Part 3: The Ratio $R$**\n\nThe ratio $R$ is defined as the temporal triangle count divided by the static triangle count.\n$$R = \\frac{\\text{temporal triangle count}}{\\text{static triangle count}}$$\nSubstituting the computed values:\n$$R = \\frac{3}{2}$$\nThe ratio is an exact fraction and is already in its simplest form.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for the total number of distinct time-respecting paths of length $2$ from node $1$ to node $5$ in a time-resolved network defined by two adjacency matrices $A^{(1)}$ and $A^{(2)}$ at strictly ordered times $t_1  t_2$.\n\nFirst, we must establish from first principles what constitutes such a path. A path of length $2$ from a starting node $u_0$ to an ending node $u_2$ is defined by a sequence of nodes $(u_0, u_1, u_2)$, where $u_1$ is an intermediate node. This corresponds to two concatenated directed edges, $(u_0 \\to u_1)$ and $(u_1 \\to u_2)$.\n\nThe problem introduces a temporal constraint. A time-respecting path of length $2$ must use its first edge at time $t_1$ and its second edge at time $t_2$. Let the desired path be from node $u=1$ to node $v=5$. Such a path can be represented by the sequence $(1, m, 5)$, where $m$ is an intermediate node from the set of all nodes $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$. For this sequence to represent a valid time-respecting path, two conditions must be met simultaneously:\n1. The edge $(1 \\to m)$ must exist at time $t_1$.\n2. The edge $(m \\to 5)$ must exist at time $t_2$.\n\nThe existence of a directed edge from a node $u$ to a node $v$ at a specific time $t_{\\ell}$ is encoded in the corresponding adjacency matrix $A^{(\\ell)}$. Specifically, the entry $A^{(\\ell)}_{uv} = 1$ if the edge $(u \\to v)$ exists at time $t_{\\ell}$, and $A^{(\\ell)}_{uv} = 0$ otherwise.\n\nApplying this to our conditions:\n1. The existence of edge $(1 \\to m)$ at time $t_1$ is equivalent to the condition $A^{(1)}_{1m} = 1$.\n2. The existence of edge $(m \\to 5)$ at time $t_2$ is equivalent to the condition $A^{(2)}_{m5} = 1$.\n\nFor any single intermediate node $m$, a path of the form $1 \\xrightarrow{t_1} m \\xrightarrow{t_2} 5$ exists if and only if both $A^{(1)}_{1m} = 1$ and $A^{(2)}_{m5} = 1$. Since the entries of the adjacency matrices are binary ($0$ or $1$), the product $A^{(1)}_{1m} A^{(2)}_{m5}$ is equal to $1$ if both conditions are met, and $0$ otherwise. Thus, this product counts the number of distinct time-respecting paths of length $2$ from node $1$ to node $5$ that pass through the specific intermediate node $m$.\n\nTo find the total number of distinct time-respecting paths of length $2$ from node $1$ to node $5$, which we denote as $N_{1 \\to 5}$, we must sum the contributions from all possible intermediate nodes. The set of intermediate nodes consists of all nodes in the network, so $m \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$. The total count is therefore the sum over all possible values of $m$:\n$$\nN_{1 \\to 5} = \\sum_{m=1}^{5} A^{(1)}_{1m} A^{(2)}_{m5}\n$$\nThis expression, derived from the fundamental definitions of paths and adjacency matrices, gives the total number of paths we seek.\n\nNext, we address why this expression naturally coincides with a particular entry of a matrix product. The definition of the product of two $n \\times n$ matrices, say $P$ and $Q$, is given by $(PQ)_{ij} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} P_{ik} Q_{kj}$. Let us consider the matrix product $M = A^{(1)} A^{(2)}$. The entry in the $1$-st row and $5$-th column of this product matrix, which we denote as $M_{15}$, is calculated as:\n$$\nM_{15} = (A^{(1)}A^{(2)})_{15} = \\sum_{m=1}^{5} A^{(1)}_{1m} A^{(2)}_{m5}\n$$\nThis is precisely the same summation we derived from first principles for the total number of time-respecting paths of length $2$ from node $1$ to node $5$. Therefore, the desired quantity is the $(1,5)$-entry of the matrix product $A^{(1)}A^{(2)}$. This result is a cornerstone of network analysis, where powers of an adjacency matrix, or products of different adjacency matrices in a temporal context, enumerate paths of corresponding lengths.\n\nFinally, we compute the exact number using the given matrices:\n$$\nA^{(1)} \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix}\n0  1  1  0  0\\\\\n0  0  1  1  0\\\\\n0  0  0  1  0\\\\\n0  0  0  0  1\\\\\n1  0  0  0  0\n\\end{pmatrix},\n\\qquad\nA^{(2)} \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix}\n0  0  1  0  1\\\\\n0  0  0  0  1\\\\\n0  1  0  0  1\\\\\n1  0  0  0  1\\\\\n0  0  0  1  0\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nTo calculate $N_{1 \\to 5} = (A^{(1)}A^{(2)})_{15}$, we require the $1$-st row of $A^{(1)}$ and the $5$-th column of $A^{(2)}$.\nThe $1$-st row of $A^{(1)}$ is $(A^{(1)}_{11}, A^{(1)}_{12}, A^{(1)}_{13}, A^{(1)}_{14}, A^{(1)}_{15}) = (0, 1, 1, 0, 0)$.\nThe $5$-th column of $A^{(2)}$ is $(A^{(2)}_{15}, A^{(2)}_{25}, A^{(2)}_{35}, A^{(2)}_{45}, A^{(2)}_{55}) = (1, 1, 1, 1, 0)$.\n\nWe now compute the sum of the element-wise products:\n$$\nN_{1 \\to 5} = \\sum_{m=1}^{5} A^{(1)}_{1m} A^{(2)}_{m5} = A^{(1)}_{11}A^{(2)}_{15} + A^{(1)}_{12}A^{(2)}_{25} + A^{(1)}_{13}A^{(2)}_{35} + A^{(1)}_{14}A^{(2)}_{45} + A^{(1)}_{15}A^{(2)}_{55}\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\nN_{1 \\to 5} = (0)(1) + (1)(1) + (1)(1) + (0)(1) + (0)(0)\n$$\n$$\nN_{1 \\to 5} = 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 2\n$$\nThe calculation yields exactly $2$. The two paths are:\n1. $1 \\xrightarrow{t_1} 2 \\xrightarrow{t_2} 5$, corresponding to the term $A^{(1)}_{12}A^{(2)}_{25} = 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n2. $1 \\xrightarrow{t_1} 3 \\xrightarrow{t_2} 5$, corresponding to the term $A^{(1)}_{13}A^{(2)}_{35} = 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\nNo intermediate step required approximation, so the final result is exact.",

Node $v$ indeed has low aggregated degree relative to nodes $b$, $c$, and $d$.\n\nWe now evaluate earliest-arrival time-respecting paths, focusing on cross-community pairs where $S_1=\\{a,b,c\\}$ and $S_2=\\{d,e\\}$.\n\nFrom $S_1$ to $d$: For $a\\to d$, a valid time-respecting path is $a\\to b$ at $t=1$, $b\\to v$ at $t=3$, $v\\to d$ at $t=4$, arriving at $t=4$. Any alternative via $(c,d)$ requires $a\\to c$ at $t=15$ followed by $c\\to d$ at $t=11$, which is invalid because $11  15$ violates strict increase; using instead $a\\to b$ at $t=1$, $b\\to c$ at $t=2$, $c\\to d$ at $t=11$ yields arrival $t=11$, which is strictly later than $t=4$. For $b\\to d$, the path $b\\to v$ at $t=3$, $v\\to d$ at $t=4$ is earliest at $t=4$, while any path through $c$ to $(c,d)$ arrives at $t=11$. For $c\\to d$, we can go $c\\to b$ at $t=2$, $b\\to v$ at $t=3$, $v\\to d$ at $t=4$, arriving at $t=4$, which beats the direct $(c,d)$ at $t=11$. In all three cases, $v$ lies on the earliest path.\n\nFrom $S_1$ to $e$: For $a\\to e$, the path $a\\to b$ at $t=1$, $b\\to v$ at $t=3$, $v\\to d$ at $t=4$, $d\\to e$ at $t=5$ arrives at $t=5$. Any alternative that tries to use $(c,d)$ first will reach $d$ no earlier than $t=11$, then $e$ at $t=5$ is not usable due to strict increase, so the next usable $(d,e)$ is at $t=5$ only (and $5  11$ is unusable). Hence all $S_1\\to e$ earliest paths include $v$. The same reasoning applies for $b\\to e$ and $c\\to e$; each earliest path goes via $b\\to v$ at $t=3$, $v\\to d$ at $t=4$, and then $d\\to e$ at $t=5$.\n\nNow consider paths in the reverse direction, from $S_2$ to $S_1$. The construction provides $(d,v)$ at $t=9$ and $(v,b)$ at $t=10$, which enable $d\\to b$ at $t=10$ via $v$. Then from $b$ to $a$ and $c$, the earliest contacts after $t=10$ are $(a,b)$ at $t=13$ and $(b,c)$ at $t=14$. Therefore, the earliest-arrival paths are:\n$d\\to b$ at $t=10$ via $d\\to v$ at $t=9$ and $v\\to b$ at $t=10$ (arrival $t=10$),\n$d\\to a$ at $t=13$ via $d\\to v$ at $t=9$, $v\\to b$ at $t=10$, $b\\to a$ at $t=13$,\n$d\\to c$ at $t=14$ via $d\\to v$ at $t=9$, $v\\to b$ at $t=10$, $b\\to c$ at $t=14$.\nAny alternative using $(c,d)$ at $t=11$ followed by $(c,b)$ at $t=14$ or $(c,a)$ at $t=15$ arrives at $t=14$ or $t=15$, never beating the $v$-mediated $t=10$ for $b$, $t=13$ for $a$, and $t=14$ for $c$. Thus $v$ lies on all $d\\to S_1$ earliest paths. For $e\\to S_1$, the earliest path is $e\\to d$ at $t=5$, then $d\\to v$ at $t=9$, $v\\to b$ at $t=10$, and onward to $a$ at $t=13$ or $c$ at $t=14$; any alternative via $(c,d)$ first would begin at $t=11$ and arrive no earlier. Hence $v$ lies on all $e\\to S_1$ earliest paths.\n\nTherefore, for every ordered pair $(s,t)$ with $s\\in S_1$, $t\\in S_2$, and also $s\\in S_2$, $t\\in S_1$, the earliest-arrival path includes $v$ as an interior node. There are $|S_1|\\cdot |S_2|\\cdot 2=3\\cdot 2\\cdot 2=12$ such ordered cross-community pairs, none of which have $s=v$ or $t=v$, so all contribute to $B_{\\mathrm{temp}}(v)$. No other node appears on all of these earliest paths: for example, $d$ is an endpoint for many $S_1\\to d$ pairs and thus excluded from betweenness counting on those pairs, and $b$ is not used on earliest $S_1\\to d$ when the source is $b$ itself (endpoints excluded) and is not on all paths to $e$. Consequently, $B_{\\mathrm{temp}}(v)$ is maximal while $\\deg_{\\bar A}(v)$ remains low. The mechanism is that $v$ is a temporal gate formed by the ordering of cross-community contacts $(b,v)$ before $(v,d)$ in one direction and $(d,v)$ before $(v,b)$ in the other, which systematically makes $v$ lie on all earliest-arrival cross-community geodesics, even though static aggregation shows $v$ has only two neighbors.\n\nVerdict for A: Correct.\n\nOption B:\nAggregated edges include $(c,d)$, $(a,b)$, $(b,c)$, $(a,c)$, $(v,a)$, $(v,b)$, $(v,c)$, $(v,d)$, and $(d,e)$. Thus $\\deg_{\\bar A}(v)=4$, which is not low relative to others, contradicting the requirement that $v$ have low aggregated degree. Moreover, the earliest cross-community connection from $\\{a,b,c\\}$ to $\\{d,e\\}$ is $(c,d)$ at $t=1$, which does not involve $v$. Many earliest-arrival paths will bypass $v$ entirely (for instance, $a\\to d$ via $a\\to c$ at $t=4$ then $c\\to d$ at $t=1$ is invalid due to time order; but $a\\to b$ at $t=2$, $b\\to c$ at $t=3$, $c\\to d$ at $t=1$ is also invalid; the point remains that $v$’s contacts are later than the earliest cross edge $(c,d)$, so the earliest paths that exist will tend to use $(c,d)$ when time order permits, not $v$). The mechanism claim that degree ensures high temporal betweenness is a misconception: temporal betweenness depends on causal ordering, not static degree.\n\nVerdict for B: Incorrect (both the degree condition and mechanism fail).\n\nOption C:\nAggregated edges include $(a,b)$, $(b,c)$, $(c,d)$, $(d,e)$, $(a,c)$, and $(v,d)$, so $\\deg_{\\bar A}(v)=1$. While this is low, $v$ cannot be on any earliest-arrival path as an interior node between distinct source and target except those where the path goes into $d$ via $v$ and then onward. However, with only a single neighbor, $v$ cannot serve as an interior bridge between two distinct nodes because any path that includes $v$ and is not ending at $v$ must pass through $v$ and immediately go to $d$; since $v$ has no other neighbor, it is never strictly interior on paths that do not begin or end at $v$. Furthermore, earliest-arrival paths between $\\{a,b,c\\}$ and $\\{d,e\\}$ are realized by $(c,d)$ at $t=3$ and $(d,e)$ at $t=4$, without requiring $v$. The mechanism claim that being unavoidable because of degree $1$ maximizes temporal betweenness is incorrect; a leaf cannot be interior to paths unless there is bidirectional timing and additional neighbors.\n\nVerdict for C: Incorrect.\n\nOption D:\nAggregated edges include $(a,b)$, $(b,c)$, $(v,d)$, $(c,d)$, $(d,e)$, and $(b,v)$, so $\\deg_{\\bar A}(v)=2$, satisfying the low degree condition. However, the time order of cross-community contacts is $(v,d)$ at $t=3$ followed by $(b,v)$ at $t=6$. This breaks the gate mechanism: for a path from $b$ (or $a$ or $c$) to $d$, going through $v$ would require $(b,v)$ at $t=6$ then $(v,d)$ at $t=3$, which is invalid because $3  6$. Instead, $(c,d)$ at $t=4$ provides an alternative cross-community connection that yields earliest-arrival paths not using $v$. Thus $v$ does not lie on earliest-arrival cross-community geodesics, and its temporal betweenness is not maximal.\n\nVerdict for D: Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, only Option A satisfies both the construction and the mechanism: $v$ has low aggregated degree but maximal temporal betweenness due to time-ordered gatekeeping that forces all earliest-arrival cross-community paths through $v$ in both directions. This illustrates the fundamental distinction between time-aggregated versus time-resolved analysis: static degree can be misleading, while causal time ordering can produce high temporal centrality for nodes with few aggregated neighbors.",
