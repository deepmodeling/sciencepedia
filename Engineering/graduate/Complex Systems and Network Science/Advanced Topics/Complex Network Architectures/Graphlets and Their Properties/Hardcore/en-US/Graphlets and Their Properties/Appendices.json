The definitions provided are consistent with established literature.\n- **Well-Posed:** The graph $G$ is explicitly and unambiguously defined.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe problem asks for two quantities related to the occurrences of the $3$-vertex path graphlet, $P_3$, within a given host graph $G$.\n\nThe host graph $G$ is defined by its vertex set $V(G) = \\{a, b, c, d\\}$ and edge set $E(G) = \\{\\{a,b\\}, \\{b,c\\}, \\{c,a\\}, \\{b,d\\}, \\{a,d\\}\\}$. This graph is a complete graph on $4$ vertices, $K_4$, with the edge $\\{c,d\\}$ removed. It can be viewed as two triangles, $\\triangle abc$ and $\\triangle abd$, sharing the edge $\\{a,b\\}$.\n\nThe graphlet of interest is $H = P_3$, the path on $3$ vertices. A graph is isomorphic to $P_3$ if it has $3$ vertices and exactly $2$ edges that are adjacent (share a vertex).\n\n**1. Calculation of $N^{\\mathrm{ind}}(P_3,G)$**\n\n$N^{\\mathrm{ind}}(P_3,G)$ is the number of $3$-vertex subsets of $V(G)$ that induce a subgraph isomorphic to $P_3$. An induced subgraph $G[S]$ contains all edges from $E(G)$ that connect two vertices in $S$. For $G[S]$ to be a $P_3$, the set $S$ must contain three vertices, and there must be exactly two edges connecting these vertices in $G$.\n\nWe must examine all possible $3$-vertex subsets of $V(G)$. The number of such subsets is $\\binom{|V(G)|}{3} = \\binom{4}{3} = 4$.\n\n- **Subset $S_1 = \\{a, b, c\\}$**: The edges in $G$ with both endpoints in $S_1$ are $\\{a,b\\}$, $\\{b,c\\}$, and $\\{c,a\\}$. The induced subgraph $G[S_1]$ has $3$ vertices and $3$ edges, forming a triangle ($K_3$). This is not isomorphic to $P_3$.\n\n- **Subset $S_2 = \\{a, b, d\\}$**: The edges in $G$ with both endpoints in $S_2$ are $\\{a,b\\}$, $\\{a,d\\}$, and $\\{b,d\\}$. The induced subgraph $G[S_2]$ also has $3$ vertices and $3$ edges, forming a triangle ($K_3$). This is not isomorphic to $P_3$.\n\n- **Subset $S_3 = \\{a, c, d\\}$**: The edges in $G$ connecting vertices in $S_3$ are:\n  - $\\{a,c\\} \\in E(G)$\n  - $\\{a,d\\} \\in E(G)$\n  - $\\{c,d\\} \\notin E(G)$\n  The induced subgraph $G[S_3]$ has $3$ vertices and $2$ edges, $\\{\\{a,c\\}, \\{a,d\\}\\}$. These edges are adjacent at vertex $a$. Thus, $G[S_3]$ is isomorphic to $P_3$ (specifically, the path $c-a-d$). This is one induced occurrence.\n\n- **Subset $S_4 = \\{b, c, d\\}$**: The edges in $G$ connecting vertices in $S_4$ are:\n  - $\\{b,c\\} \\in E(G)$\n  - $\\{b,d\\} \\in E(G)$\n  - $\\{c,d\\} \\notin E(G)$\n  The induced subgraph $G[S_4]$ has $3$ vertices and $2$ edges, $\\{\\{b,c\\}, \\{b,d\\}\\}$. These edges are adjacent at vertex $b$. Thus, $G[S_4]$ is isomorphic to $P_3$ (specifically, the path $c-b-d$). This is a second induced occurrence.\n\nSumming the valid occurrences, we find that there are $2$ induced subgraphs isomorphic to $P_3$.\nTherefore, $N^{\\mathrm{ind}}(P_3,G) = 2$.\n\n**2. Calculation of $N^{\\mathrm{sub}}(P_3,G)$**\n\n$N^{\\mathrm{sub}}(P_3,G)$ is the number of subgraphs of $G$ that are isomorphic to $P_3$. A subgraph isomorphic to $P_3$ is a path of length $2$ within $G$. This is simply a set of two edges sharing a common vertex. We do not consider whether the endpoints are connected, as this is a non-induced count.\n\nA systematic way to count such paths is to iterate through each vertex $v \\in V(G)$ and consider it as the center vertex of a path. For a given center vertex $v$, a path of length $2$ is formed by choosing two distinct neighbors of $v$. If the degree of $v$ is $\\deg(v)$, the number of ways to choose two neighbors is $\\binom{\\deg(v)}{2}$. The total number of $P_3$ subgraphs is the sum over all vertices.\n\nFirst, we determine the degrees of all vertices in $G$:\n- $\\deg(a) = 3$ (neighbors $b, c, d$)\n- $\\deg(b) = 3$ (neighbors $a, c, d$)\n- $\\deg(c) = 2$ (neighbors $a, b$)\n- $\\deg(d) = 2$ (neighbors $a, b$)\n\nNow, we calculate the number of paths centered at each vertex:\n- Number of paths centered at $a$: $\\binom{\\deg(a)}{2} = \\binom{3}{2} = \\frac{3 \\times 2}{2} = 3$.\n- Number of paths centered at $b$: $\\binom{\\deg(b)}{2} = \\binom{3}{2} = \\frac{3 \\times 2}{2} = 3$.\n- Number of paths centered at $c$: $\\binom{\\deg(c)}{2} = \\binom{2}{2} = 1$.\n- Number of paths centered at $d$: $\\binom{\\deg(d)}{2} = \\binom{2}{2} = 1$.\n\nThe total number of subgraphs isomorphic to $P_3$ is the sum of these counts:\n$N^{\\mathrm{sub}}(P_3,G) = \\sum_{v \\in V(G)} \\binom{\\deg(v)}{2} = 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 8$.\n\nThis method counts unique sets of two incident edges, which corresponds to the definition of a subgraph count where occurrences differing only by automorphism are identified.\n\nThe computed values are $N^{\\mathrm{ind}}(P_3,G) = 2$ and $N^{\\mathrm{sub}}(P_3,G) = 8$. The problem requests the final answer as a row matrix with these two values in order.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of the number of vertex orbits for two specific $4$-node graphlets: the $4$-cycle, denoted $C_4$, and the $4$-clique, denoted $K_4$. This will be done by analyzing the structure of their respective automorphism groups and the action of these groups on the vertex sets.\n\nA graph automorphism of a graph $G$ with vertex set $V(G)$ and edge set $E(G)$ is a permutation $\\sigma$ of the vertex set $V(G)$ such that for any two vertices $u, v \\in V(G)$, the pair $\\{u, v\\}$ is an edge in $E(G)$ if and only if the pair $\\{\\sigma(u), \\sigma(v)\\}$ is an edge in $E(G)$. The set of all such automorphisms forms the automorphism group, $\\operatorname{Aut}(G)$.\n\nThe group $\\operatorname{Aut}(G)$ acts on the set of vertices $V(G)$. A vertex orbit is an orbit of this group action. For any vertex $v \\in V(G)$, its orbit is the set $\\operatorname{Orb}(v) = \\{ \\sigma(v) \\mid \\sigma \\in \\operatorname{Aut}(G) \\}$. The action of $\\operatorname{Aut}(G)$ partitions the vertex set $V(G)$ into a collection of disjoint orbits. The number of these orbits is what we need to compute. A group action is called transitive if there is only one orbit, meaning for any two vertices $u, v \\in V(G)$, there exists an automorphism $\\sigma \\in \\operatorname{Aut}(G)$ such that $\\sigma(u) = v$.\n\nLet's analyze each graph separately.\n\nPart 1: The $4$-cycle, $C_4$\n\nLet the vertex set of $C_4$ be $V(C_4) = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. The edges are arranged in a cycle, so we can define the edge set as $E(C_4) = \\{\\{1, 2\\}, \\{2, 3\\}, \\{3, 4\\}, \\{4, 1\\}\\}$. Geometrically, this graph can be visualized as a square.\n\nThe automorphisms of $C_4$ are the permutations of its vertices that preserve the adjacency structure. These correspond to the symmetries of a square. The group of symmetries of a square is the dihedral group of order $8$, denoted $D_4$. Therefore, $\\operatorname{Aut}(C_4) \\cong D_4$, and its order is $|\\operatorname{Aut}(C_4)| = 8$.\n\nThe elements of $\\operatorname{Aut}(C_4)$ include:\n$1$. Four rotations of the square:\n    - Identity (rotation by $0^\\circ$): $e = (1)(2)(3)(4)$\n    - Rotation by $90^\\circ$: $\\rho_1 = (1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \\ 4)$\n    - Rotation by $180^\\circ$: $\\rho_2 = (1 \\ 3)(2 \\ 4)$\n    - Rotation by $270^\\circ$: $\\rho_3 = (1 \\ 4 \\ 3 \\ 2)$\n$2$. Four reflections of the square:\n    - Reflection across the line passing through vertices $1$ and $3$: $\\delta_1 = (2 \\ 4)$\n    - Reflection across the line passing through vertices $2$ and $4$: $\\delta_2 = (1 \\ 3)$\n    - Reflection across the line bisecting edges $\\{1, 2\\}$ and $\\{3, 4\\}$: $\\mu_1 = (1 \\ 2)(3 \\ 4)$\n    - Reflection across the line bisecting edges $\\{1, 4\\}$ and $\\{2, 3\\}$: $\\mu_2 = (1 \\ 4)(2 \\ 3)$\n\nTo find the number of vertex orbits, we determine if the action of $\\operatorname{Aut}(C_4)$ on $V(C_4)$ is transitive. We can check if any vertex can be mapped to any other vertex. Let's start with vertex $1$.\n- To map vertex $1$ to vertex $2$, we can use the rotation $\\rho_1 = (1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \\ 4)$, since $\\rho_1(1) = 2$.\n- To map vertex $1$ to vertex $3$, we can use the rotation $\\rho_2 = (1 \\ 3)(2 \\ 4)$, since $\\rho_2(1) = 3$.\n- To map vertex $1$ to vertex $4$, we can use the rotation $\\rho_3 = (1 \\ 4 \\ 3 \\ 2)$, since $\\rho_3(1) = 4$.\n\nSince vertex $1$ can be mapped to any other vertex in $V(C_4)$, the action is transitive. This means that all vertices belong to the same orbit. The orbit of vertex $1$ is $\\operatorname{Orb}(1) = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. Since this single orbit contains all vertices of the graph, there is only one vertex orbit.\n\nThus, the number of vertex orbits for $C_4$ is $x=1$.\n\nPart 2: The $4$-clique, $K_4$\n\nLet the vertex set of $K_4$ be $V(K_4) = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. A clique, or a complete graph, is a graph where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge. Thus, the edge set is $E(K_4) = \\{\\{1, 2\\}, \\{1, 3\\}, \\{1, 4\\}, \\{2, 3\\}, \\{2, 4\\}, \\{3, 4\\}\\}$.\n\nAn automorphism $\\sigma$ of $K_4$ must preserve adjacency. In $K_4$, any pair of distinct vertices $\\{u, v\\}$ is an edge. Let $\\sigma$ be any permutation of the vertex set $V(K_4)$. For any two distinct vertices $u, v \\in V(K_4)$, their images $\\sigma(u)$ and $\\sigma(v)$ are also distinct, because $\\sigma$ is a permutation. Since every pair of distinct vertices in $K_4$ is an edge, $\\{\\sigma(u), \\sigma(v)\\}$ must be an edge in $E(K_4)$. Therefore, any permutation of the vertices of $K_4$ is an automorphism.\n\nThe group of all permutations of a set of $4$ elements is the symmetric group $S_4$. Hence, the automorphism group of $K_4$ is $\\operatorname{Aut}(K_4) = S_4$. The order of this group is $|\\operatorname{Aut}(K_4)| = 4! = 24$.\n\nWe now consider the action of $\\operatorname{Aut}(K_4) = S_4$ on the vertex set $V(K_4) = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$. By definition, the action of the symmetric group $S_n$ on the set $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$ is transitive. For any two elements $i, j \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, the transposition $\\tau = (i \\ j)$ is an element of $S_4$. This automorphism maps vertex $i$ to vertex $j$, i.e., $\\tau(i) = j$.\n\nFor example, to show any vertex can be reached from vertex $1$:\n- To map vertex $1$ to vertex $2$, the transposition $(1 \\ 2) \\in S_4$ suffices.\n- To map vertex $1$ to vertex $3$, the transposition $(1 \\ 3) \\in S_4$ suffices.\n- To map vertex $1$ to vertex $4$, the transposition $(1 \\ 4) \\in S_4$ suffices.\n\nSince any vertex can be mapped to any other vertex, the action of $\\operatorname{Aut}(K_4)$ on $V(K_4)$ is transitive. Consequently, there is only one orbit, which comprises all the vertices of the graph: $\\operatorname{Orb}(1) = \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\n\nThus, the number of vertex orbits for $K_4$ is $y=1$.\n\nIn summary, for the $4$-cycle $C_4$, the number of vertex orbits is $x=1$. For the $4$-clique $K_4$, the number of vertex orbits is $y=1$. The problem asks for the answer in the form of a row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} x & y \\end{pmatrix}$.",

First, we must verify they are nonisomorphic despite having identical degree sequences. Second, we must compute their aggregate Graphlet Degree Vector (GDV) distributions for $k=3$ graphlets. Third, we compute the $\\ell_1$ distance between these two distribution vectors.\n\n### Task 1: Nonisomorphism and Degree Sequences\n\nLet us first analyze the structure of each graph to determine its degree sequence.\n\n**Graph $G_1 = K_{3,3}$ (The complete bipartite graph):**\nThe vertex set $V_1$ is composed of two disjoint sets, $L=\\{l_1, l_2, l_3\\}$ and $R=\\{r_1, r_2, r_3\\}$, so $|V_1| = 3+3=6$. An edge exists between a vertex in $L$ and a vertex in $R$ if and only if they are in different sets.\nFor any vertex $v \\in L$, it is connected to all $3$ vertices in $R$. Thus, its degree is $d(v)=3$.\nFor any vertex $v \\in R$, it is connected to all $3$ vertices in $L$. Thus, its degree is $d(v)=3$.\nTherefore, every vertex in $G_1$ has a degree of $3$. The degree sequence of $G_1$ is the multiset $\\{3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3\\}$.\n\n**Graph $G_2$ (The triangular prism):**\nThe vertex set $V_2$ consists of two sets of vertices, $A=\\{a_1, a_2, a_3\\}$ and $B=\\{b_1, b_2, b_3\\}$, forming two triangles. So $|V_2| = 3+3=6$. The edges are those within the triangles and a perfect matching connecting corresponding vertices $\\{a_i, b_i\\}$.\nConsider an arbitrary vertex, say $a_1 \\in A$. It is connected to the other two vertices in its triangle, $a_2$ and $a_3$. It is also connected to its corresponding vertex in the other triangle, $b_1$. The total number of connections is $2+1=3$. So, $d(a_1)=3$.\nDue to the symmetry of the triangular prism, all vertices are structurally equivalent (the graph is vertex-transitive). Therefore, every vertex in $G_2$ has a degree of $3$. The degree sequence of $G_2$ is the multiset $\\{3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3\\}$.\n\nBoth $G_1$ and $G_2$ are $3$-regular graphs on $6$ vertices, so they have identical degree sequences.\n\nTo prove they are nonisomorphic, we can inspect properties that must be preserved under isomorphism, such as cycle lengths.\n$G_1 = K_{3,3}$ is a bipartite graph. A fundamental property of bipartite graphs is that they contain no odd-length cycles. The shortest cycle in $K_{3,3}$ is a $4$-cycle (e.g., $l_1-r_1-l_2-r_2-l_1$).\n$G_2$, the triangular prism, is constructed with two $3$-cycles (triangles), $\\{a_1, a_2, a_3\\}$ and $\\{b_1, b_2, b_3\\}$. Since $G_2$ contains cycles of length $3$ (an odd number) and $G_1$ does not, they cannot be isomorphic. This completes the verification for Task $1$.\n\n### Task 2 & 3: Aggregate GDV Distributions and $\\ell_1$ Distance\n\nThe aggregate GDV distribution vector $A(G) = (A_1(G), A_2(G), A_3(G))$ is defined by the total number of vertex participations in each of the three $3$-node orbits: $o_1$ (wedge-leaf), $o_2$ (wedge-center), and $o_3$ (triangle).\n\nLet $N_{wedge}(G)$ be the number of induced wedges (paths on $3$ vertices, $P_3$) in a graph $G$, and let $N_{triangle}(G)$ be the number of induced triangles ($K_3$) in $G$.\nEach wedge has one center vertex (orbit $o_2$) and two leaf vertices (orbit $o_1$).\nEach triangle has three equivalent vertices (orbit $o_3$).\nThe components of the aggregate GDV distribution vector are therefore:\n$A_1(G) = 2 \\cdot N_{wedge}(G)$\n$A_2(G) = 1 \\cdot N_{wedge}(G)$\n$A_3(G) = 3 \\cdot N_{triangle}(G)$\n\nWe need to compute $N_{wedge}$ and $N_{triangle}$ for both $G_1$ and $G_2$.\n\n**Computation for $G_1 = K_{3,3}$:**\nAs established, $G_1$ is bipartite, so it contains no triangles.\n$N_{triangle}(G_1) = 0$.\n\nTo find the number of induced wedges, $N_{wedge}(G_1)$, we can count the number of such subgraphs centered at each vertex. An induced wedge centered at a vertex $v$ corresponds to a set of three vertices $\\{u, v, w\\}$ where $\\{u,v\\}$ and $\\{v,w\\}$ are edges, but $\\{u,w\\}$ is not. This means we select a vertex $v$ and two of its neighbors that are not connected to each other.\nIn $K_{3,3}$, choose any vertex $v$. It has degree $d(v)=3$. Its three neighbors all belong to the opposite partition, and thus there are no edges between them. Therefore, any pair of neighbors of $v$ will form an induced wedge with $v$ as the center.\nThe number of ways to choose $2$ neighbors from $3$ is $\\binom{3}{2} = 3$.\nSince every one of the $6$ vertices in $G_1$ can serve as the center of $3$ distinct induced wedges, the total number of induced wedges is:\n$N_{wedge}(G_1) = (\\text{number of vertices}) \\times (\\text{wedges centered at each vertex}) = 6 \\times \\binom{3}{2} = 6 \\times 3 = 18$.\n\nNow we can compute the aggregate GDV for $G_1$:\n$A_1(G_1) = 2 \\cdot N_{wedge}(G_1) = 2 \\cdot 18 = 36$.\n$A_2(G_1) = 1 \\cdot N_{wedge}(G_1) = 1 \\cdot 18 = 18$.\n$A_3(G_1) = 3 \\cdot N_{triangle}(G_1) = 3 \\cdot 0 = 0$.\nSo, $A(G_1) = (36, 18, 0)$.\n\n**Computation for $G_2$ (Triangular Prism):**\nBy construction, $G_2$ has exactly two triangles, the faces $A$ and $B$. No other combination of $3$ vertices forms a complete graph.\n$N_{triangle}(G_2) = 2$.\n\nTo find the number of induced wedges, $N_{wedge}(G_2)$, we can again count the number of wedges centered at each vertex. The number of induced wedges centered at a vertex $v$ is given by $\\binom{d(v)}{2} - t(v)$, where $d(v)$ is the degree of $v$ and $t(v)$ is the number of triangles containing $v$.\nFor any vertex $v$ in the triangular prism $G_2$, its degree is $d(v)=3$. Each vertex is part of exactly one of the two triangular faces, so $t(v)=1$.\nThe number of induced wedges centered at any single vertex $v$ is $\\binom{3}{2} - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2$.\nSince there are $6$ vertices in $G_2$, the total number of induced wedges is:\n$N_{wedge}(G_2) = (\\text{number of vertices}) \\times (\\text{wedges centered at each vertex}) = 6 \\times 2 = 12$.\n\nNow we can compute the aggregate GDV for $G_2$:\n$A_1(G_2) = 2 \\cdot N_{wedge}(G_2) = 2 \\cdot 12 = 24$.\n$A_2(G_2) = 1 \\cdot N_{wedge}(G_2) = 1 \\cdot 12 = 12$.\n$A_3(G_2) = 3 \\cdot N_{triangle}(G_2) = 3 \\cdot 2 = 6$.\nSo, $A(G_2) = (24, 12, 6)$.\n\n**Final Distance Calculation:**\nWe are asked to compute the $\\ell_1$ distance $D$ between $A(G_1)$ and $A(G_2)$.\n$D = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} |A_j(G_1) - A_j(G_2)|$\n$D = |A_1(G_1) - A_1(G_2)| + |A_2(G_1) - A_2(G_2)| + |A_3(G_1) - A_3(G_2)|$\nSubstituting the computed values:\n$D = |36 - 24| + |18 - 12| + |0 - 6|$\n$D = |12| + |6| + |-6|$\n$D = 12 + 6 + 6 = 24$.",
