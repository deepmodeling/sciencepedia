This practice explores Katz centrality, which tallies the number of walks of all lengths terminating at a node, applying an exponential decay factor $\\alpha$ to penalize longer walks.

Let $\\mathbf{1} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ denote the vector of ones. Define the out-degree centrality vector $d^{\\mathrm{out}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ by $d^{\\mathrm{out}} = A \\mathbf{1}$. Define eigenvector centrality as any vector $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}_{0}$ satisfying $A v = \\rho(A) v$, where $\\rho(A)$ denotes the spectral radius of $A$; existence and positivity follow from the Perron–Frobenius theorem for nonnegative irreducible matrices.

            "solution": "The problem defines a parameterized centrality vector $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ for a directed, strongly connected network via the equation $x = \\beta \\mathbf{1} + \\alpha A x$, with parameters $\\alpha \\ge 0$, $\\beta  0$ and the constraint $\\alpha  1/\\rho(A)$, where $\\rho(A)$ is the spectral radius of the adjacency matrix $A$. We are asked to analyze this centrality measure in two limiting cases and to compute it for a specific graph.\n\nThe defining equation can be rearranged into a standard linear system:\n$x - \\alpha A x = \\beta \\mathbf{1}$\n$(I - \\alpha A) x = \\beta \\mathbf{1}$\nwhere $I$ is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix. A unique solution for $x$ exists if and only if the matrix $(I - \\alpha A)$ is invertible. The invertibility is guaranteed by the condition imposed on $\\alpha$. The spectral radius of the matrix $\\alpha A$ is $\\rho(\\alpha A) = |\\alpha| \\rho(A)$. Since $\\alpha \\ge 0$, this is $\\alpha \\rho(A)$. The problem specifies $\\alpha  1/\\rho(A)$, which is equivalent to $\\alpha \\rho(A)  1$.\n\nA standard result in linear algebra, based on the Neumann series, states that for any square matrix $M$, if $\\rho(M)  1$, then $(I - M)$ is invertible and its inverse can be expressed as the convergent series $(I - M)^{-1} = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} M^k$. Setting $M = \\alpha A$, the condition $\\rho(\\alpha A)  1$ is met. Therefore, we can find the unique solution for $x$ as:\n$x = (I - \\alpha A)^{-1} (\\beta \\mathbf{1})$\n\nThis forms the basis for all three parts of the problem.\n\n1. Proof of the series representation and the low-$\\alpha$ limit.\n\nUsing the Neumann series expansion for $(I - \\alpha A)^{-1}$, we can write $x$ as:\n$x = \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (\\alpha A)^k \\right) \\beta \\mathbf{1}$\nSince $\\beta$ is a scalar, it can be moved outside the summation:\n$x = \\beta \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\alpha^k A^k \\mathbf{1}$\nThis proves the first required statement. This expression is known as the Katz centrality vector.\n\nTo analyze the behavior as $\\alpha \\to 0^{+}$, we expand the series:\n$x = \\beta \\left( (\\alpha A)^0 \\mathbf{1} + (\\alpha A)^1 \\mathbf{1} + \\sum_{k=2}^{\\infty} (\\alpha A)^k \\mathbf{1} \\right)$\n$x = \\beta \\left( I \\mathbf{1} + \\alpha A \\mathbf{1} + \\sum_{k=2}^{\\infty} \\alpha^k A^k \\mathbf{1} \\right)$\n$x = \\beta \\mathbf{1} + \\beta \\alpha A \\mathbf{1} + \\beta \\sum_{k=2}^{\\infty} \\alpha^k A^k \\mathbf{1}$\nThe term $\\beta \\mathbf{1}$ is a constant baseline. The next term, $\\beta \\alpha A \\mathbf{1}$, is linear in $\\alpha$. By definition, the out-degree centrality vector is $d^{\\mathrm{out}} = A \\mathbf{1}$, so this term is $\\beta \\alpha d^{\\mathrm{out}}$.\n\nWe must show that the remainder term, $R(\\alpha) = \\beta \\sum_{k=2}^{\\infty} \\alpha^k A^k \\mathbf{1}$, is of order $o(\\alpha)$. A term is $o(\\alpha)$ if it goes to zero faster than $\\alpha$, i.e., $\\lim_{\\alpha \\to 0^{+}} \\|R(\\alpha)\\|/\\alpha = 0$.\nLet's factor out $\\alpha^2$ from the remainder:\n$R(\\alpha) = \\beta \\alpha^2 \\sum_{k=2}^{\\infty} \\alpha^{k-2} A^k \\mathbf{1} = \\beta \\alpha^2 \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\alpha^{j} A^{j+2} \\mathbf{1}$\nNow we examine the limit of the ratio:\n$\\frac{\\|R(\\alpha)\\|}{\\alpha} = \\frac{\\|\\beta \\alpha^2 \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\alpha^{j} A^{j+2} \\mathbf{1}\\|}{\\alpha} = \\alpha \\|\\beta \\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\alpha^{j} A^{j+2} \\mathbf{1}\\|$\nAs $\\alpha \\to 0^{+}$, the summation term converges to $A^2 \\mathbf{1}$ (since all terms with $j0$ vanish). Thus,\n$\\lim_{\\alpha \\to 0^{+}} \\frac{\\|R(\\alpha)\\|}{\\alpha} = 0 \\cdot \\|\\beta A^2 \\mathbf{1}\\| = 0$\nSince the remainder term is $O(\\alpha^2)$, it is necessarily $o(\\alpha)$. Therefore, we have rigorously shown that:\n$x = \\beta \\mathbf{1} + \\beta \\alpha A \\mathbf{1} + o(\\alpha)$\nThis confirms that, up to the additive baseline $\\beta \\mathbf{1}$ and to first order in $\\alpha$, the centrality increment is proportional to the out-degree centrality $d^{\\mathrm{out}}$.\n\n2. Proof of convergence to the eigenvector centrality.\n\nWe analyze the behavior of $x$ as $\\alpha$ approaches its upper bound, $\\alpha \\uparrow 1/\\rho(A)$. Let $\\lambda_1 = \\rho(A)$ be the spectral radius of $A$. The network is strongly connected, so its adjacency matrix $A$ is irreducible. By the Perron-Frobenius theorem for nonnegative irreducible matrices, $\\lambda_1$ is a simple (non-repeated) positive real eigenvalue, and its corresponding right eigenvector $v$ can be chosen to have all positive components ($v  0$). Furthermore, for any other eigenvalue $\\lambda_i$ of $A$, $|\\lambda_i| \\le \\lambda_1$. The simplicity of $\\lambda_1$ means that if $|\\lambda_i| = \\lambda_1$ for some $i \\ne 1$, then $\\lambda_i$ must be complex.\n\nThe solution $x = \\beta(I - \\alpha A)^{-1}\\mathbf{1}$ can be analyzed using the spectral properties of $A$. Let $\\{v_i\\}_{i=1}^n$ be a basis of generalized right eigenvectors of $A$, and $\\{v_{L,i}\\}_{i=1}^n$ be the corresponding basis of generalized left eigenvectors, satisfying $v_{L,i}^T v_j = \\delta_{ij}$ (if normalized appropriately). The resolvent matrix $(I - \\alpha A)^{-1}$ has a spectral expansion. Near the singularity $\\alpha = 1/\\lambda_1$, the behavior of the resolvent is dominated by a simple pole. The expansion of the resolvent is given by:\n$(I - \\alpha A)^{-1} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\alpha \\lambda_1} \\frac{v v_L^T}{v_L^T v} + \\sum_{i=2}^n \\frac{1}{1 - \\alpha \\lambda_i} (\\dots)$\nwhere $v$ and $v_L$ are the right and left Perron eigenvectors corresponding to $\\lambda_1 = \\rho(A)$. The terms for $i \\ge 2$ remain bounded as $\\alpha \\to 1/\\lambda_1$ because for real $\\alpha$, $1 - \\alpha \\lambda_i \\neq 0$ since $\\lambda_1$ is the unique eigenvalue of its magnitude on the positive real axis.\n\nApplying the resolvent to the vector $\\beta \\mathbf{1}$, we get:\n$x = \\beta (I - \\alpha A)^{-1} \\mathbf{1} = \\frac{\\beta}{1 - \\alpha \\lambda_1} \\frac{v (v_L^T \\mathbf{1})}{v_L^T v} + \\text{bounded terms}$\nAs $\\alpha \\uparrow 1/\\lambda_1$, the denominator $1 - \\alpha \\lambda_1 \\to 0^{+}$. The term $v_L^T v$ is positive because all components of $v$ and $v_L$ are positive. The term $v_L^T \\mathbf{1}$ is also positive for the same reason. Let $C = \\beta \\frac{v_L^T \\mathbf{1}}{v_L^T v}$, which is a positive constant. The expression becomes:\n$x = \\frac{C}{1 - \\alpha \\lambda_1} v + \\text{bounded terms}$\nThe first term's norm goes to infinity, while the \"bounded terms\" vector remains finite. Let the bounded terms converge to a vector $y_{lim}$.\nTo find the direction of $x$, we normalize it:\n$\\frac{x}{\\|x\\|} = \\frac{\\frac{C}{1 - \\alpha \\lambda_1} v + y_{lim}}{\\|\\frac{C}{1 - \\alpha \\lambda_1} v + y_{lim}\\|}$\nWe can factor out the diverging scalar from the numerator and denominator:\n$\\frac{x}{\\|x\\|} = \\frac{\\frac{C}{1 - \\alpha \\lambda_1} \\left(v + \\frac{1 - \\alpha \\lambda_1}{C} y_{lim}\\right)}{\\left|\\frac{C}{1 - \\alpha \\lambda_1}\\right| \\left\\|v + \\frac{1 - \\alpha \\lambda_1}{C} y_{lim}\\right\\|}$\nSince $\\alpha  1/\\lambda_1$ and $C  0$, the scalar factor is positive. Thus, it cancels out.\n$\\frac{x}{\\|x\\|} = \\frac{v + \\frac{1 - \\alpha \\lambda_1}{C} y_{lim}}{\\left\\|v + \\frac{1 - \\alpha \\lambda_1}{C} y_{lim}\\right\\|}$\nAs $\\alpha \\uparrow 1/\\lambda_1$, the term $\\frac{1 - \\alpha \\lambda_1}{C} y_{lim} \\to 0$. Therefore, in the limit:\n$\\lim_{\\alpha \\uparrow 1/\\lambda_1} \\frac{x}{\\|x\\|} = \\frac{v}{\\|v\\|}$\nThis proves that the direction of the centrality vector $x$ aligns with that of the Perron eigenvector $v$ as $\\alpha$ approaches its critical value.\n\n3. Calculation for the directed $3$-cycle.\n\nThe network is the cycle $1 \\to 2 \\to 3 \\to 1$. The adjacency matrix $A$ is a permutation matrix:\n$$A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\\\ 1  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe parameters are given as $\\alpha = 1/2$ and $\\beta = 1$. First, we must verify the condition $\\alpha  1/\\rho(A)$. We find the eigenvalues of $A$ from the characteristic equation $\\det(A - \\lambda I) = 0$:\n$\\det\\begin{pmatrix} -\\lambda  1  0 \\\\ 0  -\\lambda  1 \\\\ 1  0  -\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = -\\lambda(-\\lambda^2) - 1(-1) = -\\lambda^3 + 1 = 0$\nThe eigenvalues are the cube roots of unity: $\\lambda_1 = 1$, $\\lambda_2 = \\exp(i 2\\pi/3)$, and $\\lambda_3 = \\exp(i 4\\pi/3)$. The spectral radius is $\\rho(A) = \\max_i |\\lambda_i| = 1$.\nThe condition is $\\alpha  1/1$, so $\\alpha  1$. Given $\\alpha = 1/2$, the condition $1/2  1$ is satisfied.\n\nWe need to compute $x = (I - \\alpha A)^{-1} \\beta \\mathbf{1}$. With the given parameters, this is $x = (I - \\frac{1}{2} A)^{-1} \\mathbf{1}$.\nLet $M = I - \\frac{1}{2} A$:\n$$M = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  0 \\\\ 0  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix} - \\frac{1}{2} \\begin{pmatrix} 0  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\\\ 1  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  -1/2  0 \\\\ 0  1  -1/2 \\\\ -1/2  0  1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nDue to the symmetry of the graph structure, we can anticipate that all nodes will have the same centrality score, i.e., $x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = c$ for some constant $c$. We can solve for $c$ by substituting $x = c \\mathbf{1}$ into the original equation $x = \\beta \\mathbf{1} + \\alpha A x$:\n$$c \\mathbf{1} = 1 \\cdot \\mathbf{1} + \\frac{1}{2} A (c \\mathbf{1})$$\n$$c \\mathbf{1} = \\mathbf{1} + \\frac{c}{2} A \\mathbf{1}$$\nThe matrix $A$ represents a regular graph where each node has an out-degree of $1$. So, $A\\mathbf{1} = \\mathbf{1}$.\n$$c \\mathbf{1} = \\mathbf{1} + \\frac{c}{2} \\mathbf{1}$$\nEquating the components, we get $c = 1 + c/2$, which implies $c/2 = 1$, so $c=2$.\nThus, the solution is $x = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the inverse of $M$:\n$\\det(M) = 1(1 \\cdot 1 - 0 \\cdot (-1/2)) - (-1/2)(0 \\cdot 1 - (-1/2) \\cdot (-1/2)) + 0 = 1 + (1/2)(-1/4) = 1 - 1/8 = 7/8$.\nThe adjugate of $M$ is:\n$$\\text{adj}(M) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1/2  1/4 \\\\ 1/4  1  1/2 \\\\ 1/2  1/4  1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nThe inverse is:\n$$M^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(M)} \\text{adj}(M) = \\frac{8}{7} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1/2  1/4 \\\\ 1/4  1  1/2 \\\\ 1/2  1/4  1 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nNow we compute $x = M^{-1} \\mathbf{1}$:\n$$x = \\frac{8}{7} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  1/2  1/4 \\\\ 1/4  1  1/2 \\\\ 1/2  1/4  1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{8}{7} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 \\\\ 1/4 + 1 + 1/2 \\\\ 1/2 + 1/4 + 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{8}{7} \\begin{pmatrix} 7/4 \\\\ 7/4 \\\\ 7/4 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 2 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nBoth methods yield the same result. The final answer is required as a row vector.",

The graph Laplacian is defined as $L = D - A$. Each edge $(u,v) \\in E$ has a conductance $c_{uv}$, which in this problem is $1$ for all edges.\n\nAccording to Kirchhoff's Current Law, the sum of currents entering and leaving any node must be zero. For a node $i$, the net current from its neighbors is $\\sum_{j \\sim i} I_{ji}$. If an external current $I_{\\text{ext}, i}$ is injected at node $i$, the law states:\n$$ \\sum_{j \\sim i} I_{ji} + I_{\\text{ext}, i} = 0 \\implies \\sum_{j \\sim i} I_{ij} = I_{\\text{ext}, i} $$\nwhere $I_{ij}$ is the current from node $i$ to node $j$.\n\nOhm's Law states that the current along an edge is proportional to the potential difference across it: $I_{ij} = c_{ij}(V_i - V_j)$. Since all conductances are $1$, this simplifies to $I_{ij} = V_i - V_j$.\n\nSubstituting Ohm's Law into Kirchhoff's Law for a node $i$:\n$$ \\sum_{j \\sim i} (V_i - V_j) = I_{\\text{ext}, i} $$\nThis can be rewritten using the definition of the graph Laplacian.

The effective resistance between nodes $1$ and $3$ equals $2/3$, and the current along edge $(1,3)$ under unit injection from $1$ to $3$ equals $2/3$.**\n- For injection from $s=1$ to $t=3$, the potentials were $V_1=1/3$ and $V_3=-1/3$.\n- Effective resistance $R_{13} = V_1 - V_3 = 1/3 - (-1/3) = 2/3$. The first part is correct.\n- The current on edge $(1,3)$ is given by $I_{13} = (V_1-V_3)/R_{edge}$ where $R_{edge}$ is the resistance of the single edge, which is $1$. So $I_{13} = V_1 - V_3 = 2/3$.

            "introduction": "It is a common but potentially flawed intuition to equate high betweenness centrality with an effective brokerage role. This final practice serves as a critical thought experiment, challenging you to dissect the relationship between topological position and functional role. By analyzing a carefully constructed network with directed ties and distinct social groups, you will demonstrate how a node with maximal betweenness can have its brokerage capacity completely nullified by the directionality of network flow . This exercise powerfully illustrates the necessity of selecting analytical tools that align with the specific dynamics of the system being studied.",

            "solution": "### Part 1: Centrality of Node $h$ in the Underlying Undirected Network\n\nFirst, we must construct the underlying undirected network from the given directed network.\nThe set of nodes is $V=\\{h,a_{1},a_{2},b_{1},b_{2},c_{1},c_{2}\\}$.\nThe directed edges are:\n1. $x \\to h$ for all $x \\in \\{a_{1},a_{2},b_{1},b_{2},c_{1},c_{2}\\}$. This gives the edges $a_{1} \\to h$, $a_{2} \\to h$, $b_{1} \\to h$, $b_{2} \\to h$, $c_{1} \\to h$, and $c_{2} \\to h$.\n2. The single edge $h \\to a_{1}$.\n\nTo obtain the underlying undirected network, we replace each directed edge $u \\to v$ with an undirected edge $\\{u, v\\}$. This process results in the following set of undirected edges:\n- $\\{a_{1}, h\\}$, $\\{a_{2}, h\\}$, $\\{b_{1}, h\\}$, $\\{b_{2}, h\\}$, $\\{c_{1}, h\\}$, $\\{c_{2}, h\\}$.\nThe two directed edges between $h$ and $a_{1}$ (i.e., $a_{1} \\to h$ and $h \\to a_{1}$) correspond to the same single undirected edge $\\{h, a_{1}\\}$.\nThe resulting undirected graph is a star graph with $h$ as the central node and the six other nodes $\\{a_{1},a_{2},b_{1},b_{2},c_{1},c_{2}\\}$ as leaf nodes. The degree of $h$ is $6$, and the degree of every other node is $1$.\n\nTo argue whether $h$ is central, we will use the provided definition of betweenness centrality, $C_{B}(v)=\\sum_{s \\neq v \\neq t}\\frac{\\sigma_{st}(v)}{\\sigma_{st}}$.\n\nLet's compute the betweenness centrality of the central node, $h$. The sum is over all pairs of nodes $\\{s, t\\}$ from $V \\setminus \\{h\\}$. The set $V \\setminus \\{h\\}$ consists of the $6$ leaf nodes $\\{a_{1},a_{2},b_{1},b_{2},c_{1},c_{2}\\}$.\nConsider any two distinct nodes $s$ and $t$ from this set of leaves. In a star graph, the only path between any two distinct leaf nodes is the one that goes through the central node. For instance, the path between $a_{2}$ and $b_{1}$ is $a_{2} - h - b_{1}$. The length of this path is $2$. Any other path would be longer. Therefore, this is the unique shortest path.\nFor any pair of distinct leaf nodes $\\{s, t\\}$, the total number of shortest paths is $\\sigma_{st} = 1$. This single shortest path is $s - h - t$, which passes through $h$. Thus, the number of shortest paths passing through $h$ is $\\sigma_{st}(h) = 1$.\nThe ratio $\\frac{\\sigma_{st}(h)}{\\sigma_{st}} = \\frac{1}{1} = 1$ for every pair of distinct leaf nodes.\n\nTo find $C_{B}(h)$, we sum this ratio over all such pairs. The number of ways to choose $2$ distinct nodes from the $6$ leaf nodes is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{6}{2}$.\n$C_{B}(h) = \\sum_{s,t \\in V \\setminus \\{h\\}, s \\neq t} \\frac{\\sigma_{st}(h)}{\\sigma_{st}} = \\binom{6}{2} \\times 1 = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} = 15$.\n\nNow, let's compute the betweenness centrality for any leaf node, for example, $v = a_{1}$. The sum for $C_{B}(a_{1})$ is over pairs $\\{s, t\\}$ from $V \\setminus \\{a_{1}\\}$. A node must lie on a path between two other nodes to have a non-zero betweenness centrality. In a star graph, a leaf node cannot lie on the shortest path between any other pair of nodes.\n- If the pair is $\\{h, x\\}$ where $x$ is another leaf, the shortest path is $h-x$. This does not pass through $a_{1}$.\n- If the pair is $\\{x, y\\}$ where $x$ and $y$ are two other leaves, the shortest path is $x-h-y$. This does not pass through $a_{1}$.\nTherefore, for any pair $\\{s, t\\}$ in $V \\setminus \\{a_{1}\\}$, the number of shortest paths passing through $a_1$ is $\\sigma_{st}(a_{1}) = 0$.\nThis implies $C_{B}(a_{1}) = 0$. The same logic applies to all other leaf nodes: $a_{2}, b_{1}, b_{2}, c_{1}, c_{2}$.\nSo, $C_{B}(v) = 0$ for all $v \\in \\{a_{1},a_{2},b_{1},b_{2},c_{1},c_{2}\\}$.\n\nSince $C_{B}(h) = 15$ and the centrality of every other node is $0$, node $h$ is overwhelmingly the most central node in the undirected network according to the betweenness centrality measure.\n\n### Part 2: Liaison Brokerage Count for Node $h$\n\nThe second task is to compute the liaison brokerage count $B_{\\text{liaison}}(h)$ for the node $h$ in the original directed network.\nThe definition provided is: $B_{\\text{liaison}}(b)$ is the number of ordered pairs $(s,t)$ with $s \\neq b, t \\neq b$, for which a directed path of length $2$ of the form $s \\to b \\to t$ exists, and the roles satisfy $g(s) \\neq g(t)$, $g(s) \\neq g(b)$, and $g(t) \\neq g(b)$.\n\nHere, the broker node is $b=h$. The role of the broker is $g(h) = A$.\nThe conditions for an ordered pair $(s,t)$ to contribute to $B_{\\text{liaison}}(h)$ are:\n1. $s \\neq h$ and $t \\neq h$.\n2. A directed path $s \\to h \\to t$ exists.\n3. The roles must satisfy:\n   a. $g(s) \\neq g(t)$\n   b. $g(s) \\neq g(h)$\n   c. $g(t) \\neq g(h)$\n\nLet's first identify all possible paths $s \\to h \\to t$.\nFor a path $s \\to h \\to t$ to exist, there must be an incoming edge to $h$ from $s$ and an outgoing edge from $h$ to $t$.\n- The set of nodes with an edge to $h$ is $\\text{In}(h) = \\{a_{1},a_{2},b_{1},b_{2},c_{1},c_{2}\\}$. So, $s$ must be in this set.\n- The set of nodes with an edge from $h$ is $\\text{Out}(h) = \\{a_{1}\\}$. So, $t$ must be $a_{1}$.\n\nThis means that any path of length $2$ through $h$ must be of the form $s \\to h \\to a_{1}$, where $s \\in \\{a_{1},a_{2},b_{1},b_{2},c_{1},c_{2}\\}$.\n\nNow, we check the brokerage conditions for these potential paths. A critical condition is $3(c)$, which for $b=h$ is $g(t) \\neq g(h)$.\n- The role of the broker node is $g(h) = A$.\n- For all identified paths, the target node is $t=a_{1}$.\n- The role of the target node $a_{1}$ is given as $g(a_{1}) = A$ (since $a_{1}$ is in role $A$).\n\nThe condition $g(t) \\neq g(h)$ thus becomes $g(a_{1}) \\neq g(h)$, which is $A \\neq A$. This is a contradiction.\nThis condition is violated for every possible path of length $2$ through the broker node $h$. Since at least one of the necessary conditions for liaison brokerage is never met, no ordered pair $(s,t)$ can contribute to the count.\n\nTherefore, the liaison brokerage count is zero.\n$B_{\\text{liaison}}(h) = 0$.",
