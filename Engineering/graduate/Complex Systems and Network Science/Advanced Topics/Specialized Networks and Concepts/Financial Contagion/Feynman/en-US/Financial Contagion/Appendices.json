            "problem": "Consider a system of three banks labeled $1$, $2$, and $3$ with nominal bilateral liabilities represented by the matrix $L \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times 3}$, where $L_{i j}$ is the nominal obligation of bank $i$ to bank $j$. Let\n$$\nL = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0  50  10 \\\\\n30  0  10 \\\\\n10  40  0\n\\end{pmatrix},\n$$\nand let the external asset vector be $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ given by\n$$\nx = \\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nAssume the system satisfies the canonical interbank clearing principles of limited liability (no bank pays more than the resources available to it), priority of debt (all debt obligations are settled before any equity is distributed), and proportional recovery (each creditor of a defaulting bank receives a fraction of the bank’s payment proportional to the nominal claim).

            "solution": "The problem will first be validated against the specified criteria before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe data and definitions explicitly provided in the problem statement are:\n- The system consists of three banks, labeled $1$, $2$, and $3$.\n- The nominal bilateral liability matrix is $L = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  50  10 \\\\ 30  0  10 \\\\ 10  40  0 \\end{pmatrix}$, where $L_{i j}$ is the nominal obligation of bank $i$ to bank $j$.\n- The external asset vector is $x = \\begin{pmatrix} 5 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 5 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n- The system adheres to three principles:\n    1.  Limited liability: No bank pays more than the resources available to it.\n    2.  Priority of debt: All debt obligations are settled before any equity is distributed.\n    3.  Proportional recovery: Each creditor of a defaulting bank receives a fraction of the bank’s payment proportional to their nominal claim.\n- The total nominal liability of bank $i$ is $\\bar{p}_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} L_{i j}$.\n- The actual payment made by bank $i$ is $p_i$. The vector of these payments is $p = (p_1, p_2, p_3)^{\\top}$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated based on the criteria for validity:\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is a standard application of the Eisenberg-Noe (2001) model for clearing in financial networks. This is a foundational and widely accepted model in financial economics and complex systems. The principles of limited liability, priority of debt, and proportional recovery are canonical in this context. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary data ($L$ and $x$) and a complete set of rules (the three principles) to determine the clearing payment vector $p$. It is a known result in the literature that under these conditions, a unique clearing vector exists. The problem is well-posed.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, mathematical language, free of subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n- **Other Flaws**: The problem does not exhibit any other flaws. It is not incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic, or trivial. It is a formalizable problem within the specified topic.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe objective is to find the clearing payment vector $p = (p_1, p_2, p_3)^{\\top}$. The core of the model is that the payment $p_i$ made by bank $i$ is the minimum of its total nominal liabilities $\\bar{p}_i$ and its total available resources $c_i$. The latter consists of its external assets $x_i$ plus the payments it receives from its debtors.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total nominal liabilities $\\bar{p}_i$ for each bank:\n$$\n\\bar{p}_1 = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} L_{1j} = 0 + 50 + 10 = 60\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{p}_2 = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} L_{2j} = 30 + 0 + 10 = 40\n$$\n$$\n\\bar{p}_3 = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} L_{3j} = 10 + 40 + 0 = 50\n$$\nThus, the vector of total nominal liabilities is $\\bar{p} = (60, 40, 50)^{\\top}$.\n\nThe total resources available to bank $i$, denoted by $c_i$, are its external assets $x_i$ plus the sum of payments received from other banks. According to the proportional recovery rule, bank $i$ receives a fraction $\\frac{L_{ji}}{\\bar{p}_j}$ of the actual payment $p_j$ made by bank $j$. Therefore, the total resources for bank $i$ are:\n$$\nc_i = x_i + \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\frac{L_{ji}}{\\bar{p}_j} p_j\n$$\nThis can be expressed in matrix form as $c = x + \\Pi p$, where $\\Pi$ is the relative liability matrix with elements $\\Pi_{ij} = \\frac{L_{ji}}{\\bar{p}_j}$. Let us compute $\\Pi$:\n$$\n\\Pi = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{L_{11}}{\\bar{p}_1}  \\frac{L_{21}}{\\bar{p}_2}  \\frac{L_{31}}{\\bar{p}_3} \\\\\n\\frac{L_{12}}{\\bar{p}_1}  \\frac{L_{22}}{\\bar{p}_2}  \\frac{L_{32}}{\\bar{p}_3} \\\\\n\\frac{L_{13}}{\\bar{p}_1}  \\frac{L_{23}}{\\bar{p}_2}  \\frac{L_{33}}{\\bar{p}_3}\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{0}{60}  \\frac{30}{40}  \\frac{10}{50} \\\\\n\\frac{50}{60}  \\frac{0}{40}  \\frac{40}{50} \\\\\n\\frac{10}{60}  \\frac{10}{40}  \\frac{0}{50}\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0  \\frac{3}{4}  \\frac{1}{5} \\\\\n\\frac{5}{6}  0  \\frac{4}{5} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{6}  \\frac{1}{4}  0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe principles of limited liability and priority of debt imply that the payment made by bank $i$ is $p_i = \\min(\\bar{p}_i, c_i)$. Substituting the expression for $c_i$, we get the system of equations for the clearing vector $p$:\n$$\np_i = \\min\\left(\\bar{p}_i, x_i + \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\Pi_{ij} p_j\\right) \\quad \\text{for } i = 1, 2, 3\n$$\nThis system is non-linear. We can solve it by positing which banks are solvent ($p_i = \\bar{p}_i$) and which are in default ($p_i  \\bar{p}_i$, meaning $p_i = c_i$). Let's hypothesize a state and check for consistency. A reasonable starting hypothesis is that banks with low external assets might default. Let's assume bank $2$ is solvent, while banks $1$ and $3$ are in default.\n\n**Hypothesis:**\n1. Bank 1 defaults: $p_1 = c_1 = x_1 + \\sum_{j} \\Pi_{1j} p_j$\n2. Bank 2 is solvent: $p_2 = \\bar{p}_2 = 40$\n3. Bank 3 defaults: $p_3 = c_3 = x_3 + \\sum_{j} \\Pi_{3j} p_j$\n\nUnder this hypothesis, we have the following system of linear equations for $p_1$ and $p_3$:\n$$\np_1 = 5 + (0)p_1 + \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)p_2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)p_3\n$$\n$$\np_3 = 5 + \\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)p_1 + \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)p_2 + (0)p_3\n$$\nSubstitute $p_2 = 40$:\n$$\np_1 = 5 + \\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)(40) + \\frac{1}{5}p_3 \\implies p_1 = 5 + 30 + \\frac{1}{5}p_3 \\implies p_1 = 35 + \\frac{1}{5}p_3 \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\np_3 = 5 + \\frac{1}{6}p_1 + \\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)(40) \\implies p_3 = 5 + \\frac{1}{6}p_1 + 10 \\implies p_3 = 15 + \\frac{1}{6}p_1 \\quad (2)\n$$\nWe now solve this $2 \\times 2$ system. Substitute (2) into (1):\n$$\np_1 = 35 + \\frac{1}{5}\\left(15 + \\frac{1}{6}p_1\\right)\n$$\n$$\np_1 = 35 + 3 + \\frac{1}{30}p_1\n$$\n$$\np_1 - \\frac{1}{30}p_1 = 38\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{29}{30}p_1 = 38 \\implies p_1 = 38 \\cdot \\frac{30}{29} = \\frac{1140}{29}\n$$\nNow substitute the value of $p_1$ back into (2) to find $p_3$:\n$$\np_3 = 15 + \\frac{1}{6}\\left(\\frac{1140}{29}\\right) = 15 + \\frac{190}{29} = \\frac{15 \\cdot 29 + 190}{29} = \\frac{435 + 190}{29} = \\frac{625}{29}\n$$\nOur candidate solution is $p = (1140/29, 40, 625/29)^{\\top}$.\n\nNow, we must verify that this solution is consistent with our initial hypothesis.\n1.  **Bank 1 defaults?** We must check if $p_1  \\bar{p}_1$.\n    $p_1 = 1140/29 \\approx 39.31$. $\\bar{p}_1 = 60$. Since $39.31  60$, the assumption is correct.\n2.  **Bank 3 defaults?** We must check if $p_3  \\bar{p}_3$.\n    $p_3 = 625/29 \\approx 21.55$. $\\bar{p}_3 = 50$. Since $21.55  50$, the assumption is correct.\n3.  **Bank 2 is solvent?** We must check if $c_2 \\geq \\bar{p}_2$.\n    $c_2 = x_2 + \\sum_{j} \\Pi_{2j} p_j = 0 + \\left(\\frac{5}{6}\\right)p_1 + (0)p_2 + \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)p_3$\n    $c_2 = \\frac{5}{6}\\left(\\frac{1140}{29}\\right) + \\frac{4}{5}\\left(\\frac{625}{29}\\right) = \\frac{5 \\cdot 190}{29} + \\frac{4 \\cdot 125}{29} = \\frac{950}{29} + \\frac{500}{29} = \\frac{1450}{29} = 50$\n    We check if $c_2 \\geq \\bar{p}_2$: $50 \\geq 40$. This is true. The resources of bank 2 ($c_2 = 50$) are sufficient to cover its obligations ($\\bar{p}_2 = 40$), so it pays in full, i.e., $p_2 = \\min(50, 40) = 40$. This is consistent.\n\nAll conditions of the hypothesis are verified. The clearing payment vector is $p = (1140/29, 40, 625/29)$. The problem asks for the final answer as the row matrix $(p_1, p_2, p_3)$.\n$$\np = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1140}{29}  40  \\frac{625}{29} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$",

Let $\\theta_{i} \\in (0,1]$ be the default threshold for bank $i$, interpreted as the minimal fraction of its total exposure lost due to counterparties' default that triggers $i$'s default.

I will first validate the problem and then proceed to solve each part sequentially.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Number of banks: $4$, labeled $1, 2, 3, 4$.\n- Equity capital: Each bank has equity $K  0$.\n- Other assets/liabilities: None, besides interbank claims and equity.\n- Recovery rate: Zero on defaulted interbank claims.\n- Loss propagation rule: Bank $i$ defaults if and only if the sum of losses on its interbank asset claims exceeds $K$.\n- Exogenous shock: Bank $4$ defaults initially.\n- Gross-distributed network $\\mathcal{G}$:\n  - Bank $1$ holds an asset of value $x$ on bank $2$.\n  - Bank $1$ holds an asset of value $x$ on bank $3$.\n  - Bank $2$ holds an asset of value $x$ on bank $4$.\n  - Bank $3$ holds an asset of value $x$ on bank $4$.\n  - $x  0$.\n- Path-compressed network $\\mathcal{N}$:\n  - Bank $1$ holds an asset of value $2x$ on bank $4$.\n  - The claims from $\\mathcal{G}$ are removed.\n- Task 1: Derive endogenous default sets for $\\mathcal{G}$ and $\\mathcal{N}$ as inequalities in $K$ and $x$.\n- Task 2: Find necessary and sufficient conditions on $K$ and $x$ for the endogenous default set under $\\mathcal{N}$ to be strictly larger than under $\\mathcal{G}$.\n- Task 3: Provide a concrete numerical counterexample satisfying these conditions.\n- Task 4: Compute the Lebesgue measure of the set $I(x)$ of capital levels $K$ that satisfy the condition from Task 2.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is a well-defined theoretical exercise in the study of systemic risk in financial networks, a topic within complex systems and network science.\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The model is an abstraction but is based on fundamental principles of balance sheet mechanics and loss propagation. It is a standard \"toy model\" approach used in the field to gain qualitative insights. It is free of pseudoscience.\n- **Well-Posed**: The rules are stated with mathematical precision (e.g., default if losses  $K$). The objectives are clear and admit a unique answer based on the given rules.\n- **Objective**: The language is precise and unbiased.\n- The problem is self-contained, consistent, and does not exhibit any of the flaws listed in the validation checklist. The note about preserving net interbank positions is a correct statement about the transformation from $\\mathcal{G}$ to $\\mathcal{N}$ and adds context rather than creating a contradiction.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. I will proceed with the full solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of Endogenous Default Sets**\n\nWe analyze the default cascade that follows the exogenous default of bank $4$. The default rule is that a bank defaults if its total losses from its debtors' defaults exceed its capital $K$.\n\n**Analysis of the Gross-Distributed Network ($\\mathcal{G}$)**\n1.  **Initial Shock**: Bank $4$ defaults.\n2.  **First-Round Impact**: We identify the creditors of bank $4$. These are bank $2$ and bank $3$, each holding an interbank asset of face value $x$. Upon bank $4$'s default, these assets become worthless, causing a loss of $x$ for bank $2$ and a loss of $x$ for bank $3$.\n3.  **First-Round Endogenous Defaults**:\n    -   Bank $2$ defaults if its loss exceeds its capital: $x  K$.\n    -   Bank $3$ defaults if its loss exceeds its capital: $x  K$.\n    -   Bank $1$ has no direct exposure to bank $4$, so its initial loss is $0$.\n    -   If $x \\le K$, neither bank $2$ nor bank $3$ defaults. The contagion cascade stops. The endogenous default set is the empty set, $D_{\\mathcal{G}} = \\emptyset$.\n4.  **Second-Round Impact**: If $x  K$, both bank $2$ and bank $3$ default. We now identify their creditors. Bank $1$ is the creditor to both, holding an asset of value $x$ on bank $2$ and an asset of value $x$ on bank $3$. The defaults of banks $2$ and $3$ cause bank $1$ to suffer a total loss of $x + x = 2x$.\n5.  **Second-Round Endogenous Default**: Bank $1$ defaults if its total loss exceeds its capital: $2x  K$.\n6.  **Synthesis for $\\mathcal{G}$**: The contagion cascade proceeds beyond the first round only if $x > K$, which causes banks 2 and 3 to default. We must then check the condition for bank 1, which defaults if its total loss, $2x$, exceeds its capital, $K$. Since $x > 0$, the condition $x > K$ automatically implies $2x > x > K$, so the condition $2x > K$ is always met. Thus, if banks 2 and 3 default, bank 1 is also guaranteed to default.\n    The resulting endogenous default set, $D_{\\mathcal{G}}$, is:\n    -   $D_{\\mathcal{G}} = \\emptyset$ if $x \\le K$.\n    -   $D_{\\mathcal{G}} = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ if $x  K$.\n\n**Analysis of the Path-Compressed Network ($\\mathcal{N}$)**\n1.  **Initial Shock**: Bank $4$ defaults.\n2.  **First-Round Impact**: We identify the creditor of bank $4$. This is solely bank $1$, which holds a direct interbank asset of face value $2x$. Upon bank $4$'s default, this asset becomes worthless, causing a loss of $2x$ for bank $1$.\n3.  **First-Round Endogenous Default**: Bank $1$ defaults if its loss exceeds its capital: $2x  K$.\n4.  **Further Impacts**: In network $\\mathcal{N}$, no other banks have claims on bank $1$, so if bank $1$ defaults, the cascade stops. Banks $2$ and $3$ have no interbank assets at all and thus can never suffer losses or default.\n5.  **Synthesis for $\\mathcal{N}$**: The contagion is limited to bank $1$.\n    The resulting endogenous default set, $D_{\\mathcal{N}}$, is:\n    -   $D_{\\mathcal{N}} = \\emptyset$ if $2x \\le K$.\n    -   $D_{\\mathcal{N}} = \\{1\\}$ if $2x  K$.\n\n**Task 2: Condition for Strictly Larger Default Set in $\\mathcal{N}$**\n\nWe need to find the necessary and sufficient conditions on $K$ and $x$ such that the final endogenous default set under $\\mathcal{N}$ is strictly larger than under $\\mathcal{G}$. This is denoted by $D_{\\mathcal{N}} \\supsetneq D_{\\mathcal{G}}$.\n\nLet's examine the possible default sets:\n-   $D_{\\mathcal{G}} \\in \\{\\emptyset, \\{1, 2, 3\\}\\}$\n-   $D_{\\mathcal{N}} \\in \\{\\emptyset, \\{1\\}\\}$\n\nThe only combination that satisfies $D_{\\mathcal{N}} \\supsetneq D_{\\mathcal{G}}$ is when $D_{\\mathcal{N}} = \\{1\\}$ and $D_{\\mathcal{G}} = \\emptyset$.\nFor this to occur, two conditions must be met simultaneously:\n1.  The condition for $D_{\\mathcal{N}} = \\{1\\}$ is $2x  K$.\n2.  The condition for $D_{\\mathcal{G}} = \\emptyset$ is $x \\le K$.\n\nCombining these two inequalities, we get the necessary and sufficient condition:\n$x \\le K  2x$.\n\n**Task 3: Numerical Counterexample**\n\nWe need to provide values for $x$ and $K$ that satisfy $x \\le K  2x$. Let's choose $x=100$ and $K=150$. These values satisfy the condition since $100 \\le 150  2 \\times 100 = 200$.\n\n-   **Verification for $\\mathcal{G}$**:\n    -   Bank 4 defaults.\n    -   Loss for bank 2 is $x = 100$.\n    -   Loss for bank 3 is $x = 100$.\n    -   Default condition for bank 2: Is loss  K? Is $100  150$? No.\n    -   Default condition for bank 3: Is loss  K? Is $100  150$? No.\n    -   Since neither bank 2 nor 3 defaults, the contagion stops.\n    -   The endogenous default set is $D_{\\mathcal{G}} = \\emptyset$.\n\n-   **Verification for $\\mathcal{N}$**:\n    -   Bank 4 defaults.\n    -   Loss for bank 1 is $2x = 200$.\n    -   Default condition for bank 1: Is loss  K? Is $200  150$? Yes.\n    -   Bank 1 defaults. The cascade stops.\n    -   The endogenous default set is $D_{\\mathcal{N}} = \\{1\\}$.\n\nComparing the results, $D_{\\mathcal{N}} = \\{1\\}$ and $D_{\\mathcal{G}} = \\emptyset$. Indeed, $D_{\\mathcal{N}} \\supsetneq D_{\\mathcal{G}}$, so the counterexample is valid.\n\n**Task 4: Lebesgue Measure of $I(x)$**\n\nThe set $I(x)$ consists of all capital levels $K$ for which the compressed network $\\mathcal{N}$ produces a strictly larger final endogenous default set than the gross-distributed network $\\mathcal{G}$. From Task 2, we found this condition to be $x \\le K  2x$.\n\nSo, for a given $x  0$, the set $I(x)$ is defined as:\n$$I(x) = \\{K \\in \\mathbb{R}^+ \\mid x \\le K  2x\\}$$\nThis set represents the half-open interval $[x, 2x)$.\n\nThe Lebesgue measure of a one-dimensional interval is its length. The length of the interval $[a, b)$ is $b - a$.\nTherefore, the Lebesgue measure of $I(x)$, denoted as $\\lambda(I(x))$, is:\n$$\\lambda(I(x)) = 2x - x = x$$\nThe length of the set of capital levels for which network compression paradoxically increases systemic risk is equal to the base exposure value $x$.",
