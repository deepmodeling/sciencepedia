A perfectly nested configuration is one in which species in poorer sites are subsets of those in richer sites, equivalently, the matrix can be packed so that the $1$-entries form a contiguous block near the top-left corner. Begin from the following foundational elements:\n- A binary incidence matrix $\\mathbf{M} \\in \\{0,1\\}^{5 \\times 5}$, with entries $M_{ij}$, where $i \\in \\{1,\\dots,5\\}$ indexes sites and $j \\in \\{1,\\dots,5\\}$ indexes species.\n- Packing the matrix means reordering rows and columns by decreasing marginal totals so that the filled cells are maximally concentrated toward the top-left.\n- In a perfectly nested packed matrix, each row $i$ contains its $R_{i}$ presences in the first $R_{i}$ columns. The idealized boundary between expected presences and expected absences in row $i$ is a vertical isocline located halfway between column $R_{i}$ and column $R_{i}+1$.\n\nYou are given the original binary matrix and its packed form:\n$$\n\\mathbf{M} \\;=\\;\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix},\n\\qquad\n\\mathbf{P} \\;=\\;\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\n\nDefine the isocline in the packed matrix $\\mathbf{P}$ row by row as follows: if row $i$ of $\\mathbf{P}$ contains $R_{i}$ ones, the isocline within that row is the vertical line at the horizontal coordinate $j_{b}(i) = R_{i} + \\tfrac{1}{2}$.

The total number of unexpected entries is $U = 6$.\n\nNext, we compute the distance $d_{ij}$ for each unexpected entry. The distance is the horizontal distance from the center of the cell $(i,j)$, which has horizontal coordinate $j$, to the vertical isocline at $j_{b}(i)$. The formula is $d_{ij} = |j - j_{b}(i)|$.\n\n- For $(2,4)$: $j=4$, $R_2=4$, so $j_{b}(2)=4.5$. The distance is $d_{2,4} = |4 - 4.5| = 0.5$.\n- For $(2,5)$: $j=5$, $R_2=4$, so $j_{b}(2)=4.5$.

The sum of these distances is:\n$$\n\\sum_{(i,j) \\in \\mathcal{U}} d_{ij} = 6 \\times 0.5 = 3\n$$\n\nThe normalization factor is the Euclidean length of the matrix diagonal, given by $\\sqrt{n^2 + m^2}$.

            "problem": "Consider a binary bipartite incidence matrix representation of an ecological mutualistic network, where rows correspond to one guild (for example, plants) and columns correspond to the other guild (for example, pollinators). Let each entry be either $0$ or $1$ indicating absence or presence of an interaction. The Nestedness metric based on Overlap and Decreasing Fill (NODF) quantifies nestedness based on the principle that higher-degree species should have interaction sets that contain those of lower-degree species, and it aggregates normalized overlaps across pairs of rows and pairs of columns with strictly decreasing degrees. The Atmar and Patterson's matrix temperature (temperature) quantifies the disorder of the matrix relative to a perfectly nested “packed” arrangement by assigning a penalty to “unexpected presences” below the idealized isocline and “unexpected absences” above it, weighted by their geometric distance to the isocline; the packed arrangement orders rows and columns by decreasing marginal totals, with tie-handling not fully specified by the degrees alone.\n\nConstruct a counterexample showing that two matrices with identical NODF can have different temperatures, and interpret the discrepancy in terms of invariance properties and geometric sensitivity. To this end, consider the following two $5 \\times 5$ matrices $M_1$ and $M_2$, whose row and column degrees are both ordered in nonincreasing order (rows from top to bottom and columns from left to right), with ties present in both guilds:\n\n$$\nM_1 \\;=\\;\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\quad\\text{and}\\quad\nM_2 \\;=\\;\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\n\nIn both $M_1$ and $M_2$, the row degree sequence is $(4,3,3,2,1)$ and the column degree sequence is $(4,3,3,2,1)$. The two matrices differ only by a permutation of the two columns of degree $3$.\n\nWhich option correctly characterizes the nestedness metrics of $M_1$ and $M_2$ and gives the correct interpretation of why the discrepancy arises?\n\nA. $M_1$ and $M_2$ have identical NODF but different temperatures, because NODF is invariant to any permutation of rows or columns (it depends only on the sets of interactions and degree comparisons), whereas temperature is sensitive to the geometric placement of $1$s relative to the isocline after packing; swapping tied-degree columns changes the horizontal coordinates (and thus the distances) of unexpected presences and absences without altering overlap-based nestedness.\n\nB. $M_1$ and $M_2$ have identical NODF and identical temperatures, because both metrics depend only on the row and column degree sequences and are therefore unchanged by any permutation of rows or columns.\n\nC. $M_1$ and $M_2$ have different NODF but identical temperatures, because temperature depends only on the number of unexpected presences and absences, not on their positions, whereas NODF is sensitive to which specific pairs of species overlap.\n\nD. $M_1$ and $M_2$ have different NODF and different temperatures, because permuting any columns necessarily changes both the overlap structure and the disorder relative to the isocline in a way that cannot preserve either metric.",
            "solution": "The problem asks to compare the NODF and matrix temperature metrics for two matrices, $M_1$ and $M_2$, where $M_2$ is obtained from $M_1$ by permuting two columns of equal degree.\n\n**Analysis of NODF**\nThe Nestedness metric based on Overlap and Decreasing Fill (NODF) is calculated based on pairwise overlaps of rows and columns, after they are sorted by degree. The contribution of a pair of nodes (e.g., rows) $(i, j)$ with degrees $d_i > d_j$ is the fraction of interactions of node $j$ that are a subset of the interactions of node $i$.\n1.  **Row contributions:** A permutation of columns does not change the degree of any row. It also does not change the overlap (number of shared partners) between any two rows, as the overlap calculation sums over all columns, making it insensitive to their order. Therefore, the total contribution from row pairs to the NODF score is identical for $M_1$ and $M_2$.\n2.  **Column contributions:** Permuting two columns of equal degree means the set of all column vectors (and their degrees) remains identical for both matrices. Since the NODF calculation for columns sums up the overlap contributions from all comparable pairs of columns, and this set of pairs is the same for both matrices, the total column contribution is also identical.\n\nSince both the row and column components of the NODF calculation are unchanged, we can conclude that $\\text{NODF}(M_1) = \\text{NODF}(M_2)$.\n\n**Analysis of Matrix Temperature (T)**\nThe matrix temperature metric quantifies disorder relative to a perfectly nested ideal. It identifies \"unexpected\" presences (1s) and absences (0s) relative to an isocline and penalizes them. Crucially, this penalty is weighted by the **geometric distance** of the unexpected cell from the isocline. This means the penalty for a surprise at cell $(i, j)$ depends on its specific coordinates.\n\nWhen columns 2 and 3 of $M_1$ are swapped to create $M_2$, the patterns of 1s and 0s in those columns are moved to new horizontal positions. For example, any surprise located in column 2 of $M_1$ is now in column 3 of $M_2$. Since its horizontal coordinate has changed from $j=2$ to $j=3$, its geometric distance to the isocline also changes, and thus its contribution to the total temperature score is different. As the two columns being swapped are not identical in their internal structure, this redistribution of surprises to positions with different geometric weights will change the overall temperature.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that $\\text{T}(M_1) \\neq \\text{T}(M_2)$.\n\n**Evaluating the Options**\nBased on the analysis:\n-   $\\text{NODF}(M_1) = \\text{NODF}(M_2)$\n-   $\\text{T}(M_1) \\neq \\text{T}(M_2)$\n\nOption A correctly states that $M_1$ and $M_2$ have identical NODF but different temperatures. Its reasoning aligns with our analysis: NODF is invariant because it depends on combinatorial overlaps, while temperature is sensitive to the geometric placement of interactions.\nOptions B, C, and D all make incorrect claims about whether the metrics are identical or different.\n\nThe correct choice is A.",
