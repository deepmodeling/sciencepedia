This exercise asks you to manually compute the first two iterations of opinion dynamics in a simple two-agent system. By calculating how each agent forms a new opinion as a weighted average of the previous ones, you will gain a concrete intuition for the iterative mechanism that drives the entire model towards consensus .",

            "problem": "Consider a two-agent opinion formation process governed by the DeGroot model for consensus, in which each agent updates its opinion by taking a weighted average of all agents’ previous opinions. The update is represented by multiplying the opinion vector at time $t$ by a nonnegative row-stochastic matrix $W$, where each row sums to $1$ and encodes the weights used by the corresponding agent. Let the weight matrix be\n$$\nW=\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.5  0.5 \\\\\n0.2  0.8\n\\end{pmatrix},\n$$\nand the initial opinion vector be\n$$\nx(0)=\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nStarting from foundational principles—namely, that a row-stochastic matrix produces convex combinations of the previous opinions for each agent—compute the opinion vectors $x(1)$ and $x(2)$ generated by this process. Then, for each entry of $x(1)$ and $x(2)$, interpret it explicitly as a weighted average of the entries of $x(0)$ and $x(1)$, respectively, making clear which weights are applied to which past opinions. Express your final numerical values exactly as rational numbers. Provide your final answer in the form of the single concatenated row vector $\\left(x_{1}(1),\\,x_{2}(1),\\,x_{1}(2),\\,x_{2}(2)\\right)$.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in the established DeGroot model of consensus dynamics, a standard topic in network science and systems theory. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information—the weight matrix $W$ and the initial opinion vector $x(0)$—to uniquely determine the subsequent opinion vectors. The data provided ($W$ is a valid row-stochastic matrix, $x(0)$ is a standard initial condition) is consistent and free of contradictions. The objective is clear and formalizable.\n\nThe DeGroot model describes the evolution of opinions in a network of agents. The state of the system at time step $t$ is given by an opinion vector $x(t)$, where the $i$-th component, $x_i(t)$, represents the opinion of agent $i$. The opinions are updated synchronously according to the linear iteration:\n$$x(t+1) = W x(t)$$\nwhere $W$ is a row-stochastic matrix. The entry $W_{ij}$ of this matrix represents the weight that agent $i$ gives to the opinion of agent $j$ from the previous time step. Since $W$ is row-stochastic, each row sums to $1$, ensuring that each new opinion $x_i(t+1)$ is a convex combination (a weighted average) of the previous opinions $\\{x_j(t)\\}$.\n\nThe given weight matrix is\n$$\nW=\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.5  0.5 \\\\\n0.2  0.8\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nand the initial opinion vector is\n$$\nx(0)=\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nFor calculations involving rational numbers, we convert the decimal entries of $W$ to fractions:\n$$\nW=\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{2}  \\frac{1}{2} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{5}  \\frac{4}{5}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nFirst, we compute the opinion vector at time $t=1$.\n$$\nx(1) = W x(0) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{2}  \\frac{1}{2} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{5}  \\frac{4}{5}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe components of $x(1)$ are calculated as follows:\n$$\nx_1(1) = W_{11}x_1(0) + W_{12}x_2(0) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)(1) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)(0) = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\n$$\nx_2(1) = W_{21}x_1(0) + W_{22}x_2(0) = \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)(1) + \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)(0) = \\frac{1}{5}\n$$\nSo, the opinion vector at $t=1$ is $x(1) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{2} \\\\ \\frac{1}{5} \\end{pmatrix}$.\nInterpreting these results as weighted averages:\n- Agent 1's new opinion, $x_1(1)=\\frac{1}{2}$, is a weighted average of the initial opinions, where agent 1 weights its own initial opinion $x_1(0)=1$ with a weight of $\\frac{1}{2}$ and agent 2's initial opinion $x_2(0)=0$ with a weight of $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n- Agent 2's new opinion, $x_2(1)=\\frac{1}{5}$, is a weighted average where agent 2 weights agent 1's initial opinion $x_1(0)=1$ with a weight of $\\frac{1}{5}$ and its own initial opinion $x_2(0)=0$ with a weight of $\\frac{4}{5}$.\n\nNext, we compute the opinion vector at time $t=2$.\n$$\nx(2) = W x(1) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{2}  \\frac{1}{2} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{5}  \\frac{4}{5}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{1}{2} \\\\\n\\frac{1}{5}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe components of $x(2)$ are calculated as follows:\n$$\nx_1(2) = W_{11}x_1(1) + W_{12}x_2(1) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{10} = \\frac{5}{20} + \\frac{2}{20} = \\frac{7}{20}\n$$\n$$\nx_2(2) = W_{21}x_1(1) + W_{22}x_2(1) = \\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{5}\\right) = \\frac{1}{10} + \\frac{4}{25} = \\frac{5}{50} + \\frac{8}{50} = \\frac{13}{50}\n$$\nSo, the opinion vector at $t=2$ is $x(2) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{7}{20} \\\\ \\frac{13}{50} \\end{pmatrix}$.\nInterpreting these results as weighted averages:\n- Agent 1's opinion at $t=2$, $x_1(2)=\\frac{7}{20}$, is a weighted average of the opinions at $t=1$, where agent 1 weights its own previous opinion $x_1(1)=\\frac{1}{2}$ with a weight of $\\frac{1}{2}$ and agent 2's previous opinion $x_2(1)=\\frac{1}{5}$ with a weight of $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n- Agent 2's opinion at $t=2$, $x_2(2)=\\frac{13}{50}$, is a weighted average of the opinions at $t=1$, where agent 2 weights agent 1's previous opinion $x_1(1)=\\frac{1}{2}$ with a weight of $\\frac{1}{5}$ and its own previous opinion $x_2(1)=\\frac{1}{5}$ with a weight of $\\frac{4}{5}$.\n\nThe problem requests the final answer as the single concatenated row vector $\\left(x_{1}(1),\\,x_{2}(1),\\,x_{1}(2),\\,x_{2}(2)\\right)$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the influence vector $\\pi$ and the consensus value $c$ for a DeGroot consensus model defined by the opinion update rule $x(t+1)=W\\,x(t)$. The influence matrix $W$ is given as\n$$\nW=\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.7  0.3  0 \\\\\n0.2  0.5  0.3 \\\\\n0  0.4  0.6\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nand the initial opinion vector is\n$$\nx(0)=\\begin{pmatrix}1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 0\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe matrix $W$ has non-negative entries, and the sum of the entries in each row is $1$. For example, for the first row, $0.7 + 0.3 + 0 = 1$. This confirms that $W$ is a row-stochastic matrix. Furthermore, while $W$ has zero entries, its square is\n$$\nW^2 = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0.7  0.3  0 \\\\\n0.2  0.5  0.3 \\\\\n0  0.4  0.6\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.7  0.3  0 \\\\\n0.2  0.5  0.3 \\\\\n0  0.4  0.6\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.55  0.36  0.09 \\\\\n0.24  0.43  0.33 \\\\\n0.08  0.44  0.48\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSince all entries of $W^2$ are strictly positive, the matrix $W$ is primitive.\n\nAccording to the Perron–Frobenius theorem for primitive non-negative matrices, such a matrix has a unique largest eigenvalue, which is real and positive. For a row-stochastic matrix, this eigenvalue is $\\lambda_1 = 1$. The theorem also guarantees the existence of a unique left eigenvector $\\pi^{\\top}$ corresponding to $\\lambda_1 = 1$, which can be normalized such that its components are strictly positive and sum to $1$. This vector $\\pi$ is the influence vector, representing the stationary distribution of influence among the agents.\n\nFirst, we find the influence vector $\\pi = \\begin{pmatrix} \\pi_1  \\pi_2  \\pi_3 \\end{pmatrix}^{\\top}$. It must satisfy the eigenvector equation $\\pi^{\\top}W = \\pi^{\\top}$, which is equivalent to $W^{\\top}\\pi = \\pi$, or $(W^{\\top}-I)\\pi = \\mathbf{0}$, where $I$ is the identity matrix and $\\mathbf{0}$ is the zero vector.\n\nThe transpose of $W$ is\n$$\nW^{\\top} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0.7  0.2  0 \\\\\n0.3  0.5  0.4 \\\\\n0  0.3  0.6\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe matrix $(W^{\\top}-I)$ is\n$$\nW^{\\top}-I = \\begin{pmatrix}\n0.7-1  0.2  0 \\\\\n0.3  0.5-1  0.4 \\\\\n0  0.3  0.6-1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= \\begin{pmatrix}\n-0.3  0.2  0 \\\\\n0.3  -0.5  0.4 \\\\\n0  0.3  -0.4\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe system of linear equations $(W^{\\top}-I)\\pi = \\mathbf{0}$ is:\n\\begin{align*}\n-0.3 \\pi_1 + 0.2 \\pi_2 = 0 \\\\\n0.3 \\pi_1 - 0.5 \\pi_2 + 0.4 \\pi_3 = 0 \\\\\n0.3 \\pi_2 - 0.4 \\pi_3 = 0\n\\end{align*}\nFrom the first equation, we get $0.3 \\pi_1 = 0.2 \\pi_2$, which simplifies to $3 \\pi_1 = 2 \\pi_2$, or $\\pi_1 = \\frac{2}{3} \\pi_2$.\nFrom the third equation, we get $0.3 \\pi_2 = 0.4 \\pi_3$, which simplifies to $3 \\pi_2 = 4 \\pi_3$, or $\\pi_3 = \\frac{3}{4} \\pi_2$.\nSubstituting these into the second equation confirms consistency: $0.3(\\frac{2}{3}\\pi_2) - 0.5\\pi_2 + 0.4(\\frac{3}{4}\\pi_2) = 0.2\\pi_2 - 0.5\\pi_2 + 0.3\\pi_2 = 0$.\nThe eigenvector $\\pi$ is thus proportional to the vector $\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{2}{3}  1  \\frac{3}{4} \\end{pmatrix}^{\\top}$. To work with integers, we can multiply by the least common multiple of the denominators, which is $12$, to get a proportional vector $\\begin{pmatrix} 8  12  9 \\end{pmatrix}^{\\top}$.\n\nNow, we must normalize this vector so that its components sum to $1$, satisfying the condition $\\pi^{\\top}\\mathbf{1} = \\sum_{i=1}^3 \\pi_i = 1$. The sum of the unnormalized components is $8 + 12 + 9 = 29$.\nThus, the influence vector $\\pi$ is:\n$$\n\\pi = \\frac{1}{29}\\begin{pmatrix} 8 \\\\ 12 \\\\ 9 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 8/29 \\\\ 12/29 \\\\ 9/29 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nExplicitly verifying the normalization as required: $\\pi_1+\\pi_2+\\pi_3 = \\frac{8}{29} + \\frac{12}{29} + \\frac{9}{29} = \\frac{8+12+9}{29} = \\frac{29}{29} = 1$. This is correct.\n\nNext, we compute the consensus value $c$. The dynamics converge to a state where all opinions are equal, i.e., $\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} x(t) = c\\mathbf{1}$.\nLet us consider the quantity $M(t) = \\pi^{\\top}x(t)$. Its evolution in time is\n$$\nM(t+1) = \\pi^{\\top}x(t+1) = \\pi^{\\top}(W x(t)) = (\\pi^{\\top}W)x(t)\n$$\nSince $\\pi^{\\top}$ is the left eigenvector of $W$ with eigenvalue $1$, we have $\\pi^{\\top}W = \\pi^{\\top}$. Therefore,\n$$\nM(t+1) = \\pi^{\\top}x(t) = M(t)\n$$\nThis shows that $M(t)$ is a conserved quantity. The value of $M(t)$ is constant for all $t \\ge 0$.\nThus, $M(\\infty) = M(0)$.\nThe limit value is $M(\\infty) = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\pi^{\\top}x(t) = \\pi^{\\top} (c\\mathbf{1}) = c (\\pi^{\\top}\\mathbf{1}) = c(1) = c$.\nThe initial value is $M(0) = \\pi^{\\top}x(0)$.\nEquating these, we find the consensus value is $c = \\pi^{\\top}x(0)$.\n\nUsing the given initial state $x(0) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  2  0 \\end{pmatrix}^{\\top}$ and the derived influence vector $\\pi$:\n$$\nc = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{8}{29}  \\frac{12}{29}  \\frac{9}{29} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 2 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nc = \\left(\\frac{8}{29}\\right)(1) + \\left(\\frac{12}{29}\\right)(2) + \\left(\\frac{9}{29}\\right)(0) = \\frac{8 + 24 + 0}{29} = \\frac{32}{29}\n$$\nThe consensus value is $c = \\frac{32}{29}$.\n\nThe components of the influence vector are $\\pi_1 = \\frac{8}{29}$, $\\pi_2 = \\frac{12}{29}$, $\\pi_3 = \\frac{9}{29}$, and the consensus value is $c = \\frac{32}{29}$.\nThe final answer is presented as a row matrix containing these four values.",

The opinion of agent $i$ at time $t$ is $x_i(t)$, and the vector of all opinions is $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^4$. The evolution is governed by the row-stochastic matrix $W$.\n\nFirst, we identify the absorbing node(s) in the confidence graph $G(W)$. An agent $i$ corresponds to an absorbing node if they only listen to their own opinion, meaning their opinion does not change based on others. Mathematically, this corresponds to the $i$-th row of the matrix $W$ having $w_{ii} = 1$ and $w_{ij} = 0$ for all $j \\neq i$.\nWe inspect the diagonal elements of the given matrix $W$:\n$$\nW \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix}\n0.5  0.5  0  0 \\\\\n0.25  0.25  0.5  0 \\\\\n0  0  1  0 \\\\\n0.3  0.2  0.5  0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n-   $w_{11} = 0.5 \\neq 1$.\n-   $w_{22} = 0.25 \\neq 1$.\n-   $w_{33} = 1$.

The index of the absorbing node is $3$.\n\nSince agent $3$ is an absorbing node, its opinion remains constant for all time. The update rule for $x_3(t)$ is $x_3(t+1) = w_{31} x_1(t) + w_{32} x_2(t) + w_{33} x_3(t) + w_{34} x_4(t) = 0 \\cdot x_1(t) + 0 \\cdot x_2(t) + 1 \\cdot x_3(t) + 0 \\cdot x_4(t) = x_3(t)$.
