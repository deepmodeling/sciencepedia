The state of the entire system at a discrete time step $t$ is described by the binary vector $S(t) = (x_1(t), x_2(t), x_3(t))$, where $x_i(t)$ is the state of Gene $i$.\n\nThe network updates its state synchronously, meaning all genes change their state at the same time.

Report the basin sizes as a row matrix in the following canonical order: first sort attractors by increasing period (fixed points before cycles of length $2$, length $2$ before length $3$, and so on), and for attractors with equal period, break ties by the lexicographic order of their state-encoding sequences (for a cycle, use the lexicographically smallest state on the cycle as its representative). No rounding is required. Your final answer must be the requested row matrix only.",
            "solution": "The problem describes a synchronous Boolean network with $N=3$ nodes. The state of the network at time $t$ is a vector $x(t) = (x_1(t), x_2(t), x_3(t))$ in the state space $\\{0,1\\}^3$. The total number of states is $2^3 = 8$. The dynamics are governed by a deterministic global update map $T: \\{0,1\\}^3 \\to \\{0,1\\}^3$, where the state at time $t+1$ is given by $x(t+1) = T(x(t))$. The component functions for the update map are:\n$$x_1(t+1) = f_1(x(t)) = x_2(t) \\oplus x_3(t)$$\n$$x_2(t+1) = f_2(x(t)) = x_1(t)$$\n$$x_3(t+1) = f_3(x(t)) = x_1(t) \\land x_2(t)$$\nwhere $\\oplus$ denotes the exclusive-or operation and $\\land$ denotes the logical AND operation.\n\nTo analyze the network's dynamics, we construct the full state transition graph. This requires computing the successor state $T(x)$ for each of the $8$ possible states $x \\in \\{0,1\\}^3$. Let $x = (x_1, x_2, x_3)$ and its successor be $x' = (x_1', x_2', x_3')$. The transitions are as follows:\n\n1.  For state $(0,0,0)$: $x' = (0 \\oplus 0, 0, 0 \\land 0) = (0,0,0)$.\n2.  For state $(0,0,1)$: $x' = (0 \\oplus 1, 0, 0 \\land 0) = (1,0,0)$.\n3.

For state $(1,1,1)$: $x' = (1 \\oplus 1, 1, 1 \\land 1) = (0,1,1)$.\n\nThe state transition graph, which has the $8$ states as vertices and directed edges from each state $x$ to $T(x)$, can be summarized by these transitions:\n- $T(0,0,0) = (0,0,0)$\n- $T(0,0,1) = (1,0,0)$\n- $T(0,1,0) = (1,0,0)$\n- $T(0,1,1) = (0,0,0)$\n- $T(1,0,0) = (0,1,0)$\n- $T(1,0,1) = (1,1,0)$\n- $T(1,1,0) = (1,1,1)$\n- $T(1,1,1) = (0,1,1)$\n\nAn attractor is a set of states from which the system cannot escape. In a finite deterministic system, attractors consist of fixed points and limit cycles. We identify these by tracing the pathways in the state transition graph.\n\nFrom the transition $T(0,0,0) = (0,0,0)$, we identify a fixed point. Let us call this Attractor $1$ ($A_1$).\n- $A_1 = \\{(0,0,0)\\}$. This is an attractor of period $P_1=1$. Its representative state is $(0,0,0)$.\n\nNext, we trace the trajectory starting from an unclassified state, for example, $(0,0,1)$:\n- $(0,0,1) \\to (1,0,0) \\to (0,1,0) \\to (1,0,0)$.\nThis reveals a limit cycle of period $2$ between states $(1,0,0)$ and $(0,1,0)$. Let us call this Attractor $2$ ($A_2$).\n- $A_2 = \\{(0,1,0), (1,0,0)\\}$. This is an attractor of period $P_2=2$. To find its representative state, we compare the states in the cycle lexicographically: $(0,1,0)$ is smaller than $(1,0,0)$. Thus, the representative state for $A_2$ is $(0,1,0)$.\n\nThe basin of attraction for an attractor is the set of all states that eventually lead into that attractor.

The corresponding ordered sequence of basin sizes is $(5, 3)$. This should be reported as a row matrix.",
