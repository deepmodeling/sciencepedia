            "problem": "Consider a continuous-time Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system defined by the state-space equation $\\dot{x}(t)=A\\,x(t)+B\\,u(t)$, where $x(t)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the state, $u(t)\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m}$ is the input, $A\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}$ is the state matrix, and $B\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times m}$ is the input matrix. The concept of controllability asks whether, for any initial state $x(0)$ and any desired final state $x(T)$ at a finite time $T>0$, there exists an input $u(t)$ that steers the system from $x(0)$ to $x(T)$. One fundamental tool to assess controllability is the controllability matrix, formed from repeated applications of the state matrix to the input directions, and another is the finite-horizon controllability Gramian, defined via the state transition operator.\n\nLet $n=2$ and $m=1$, and consider\n$$\nA=\\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1\\\\ 0 & 0\\end{bmatrix},\\qquad B=\\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\ 1\\end{bmatrix}.\n$$\nTasks:\n- Using the core definition of the controllability matrix for $\\dot{x}(t)=A\\,x(t)+B\\,u(t)$, compute the controllability matrix $C$ for this system and determine whether the system is controllable by the rank condition.\n- As a cross-check grounded in first principles, derive the finite-horizon controllability Gramian $W_{c}(T)$ for an arbitrary horizon $T>0$ using the state transition operator, and discuss its positive definiteness for $T>0$.\n\nReport the rank of the controllability matrix $C$ as your final answer.

            "solution": "The problem presents a continuous-time Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) system and asks for an analysis of its controllability using two standard methods: the controllability matrix and the controllability Gramian.\n\nThe system is described by the state-space equation $\\dot{x}(t)=A\\,x(t)+B\\,u(t)$, with the state dimension $n=2$ and the input dimension $m=1$. The given matrices are:\n$$\nA=\\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1\\\\ 0 & 0\\end{bmatrix},\\qquad B=\\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\ 1\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe first task is to compute the controllability matrix $C$ and use its rank to determine if the system is controllable.\nFor a general LTI system of dimension $n$, the controllability matrix is defined as:\n$$\nC = \\begin{bmatrix} B & AB & A^2B & \\cdots & A^{n-1}B \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nIn this specific case, $n=2$, so the controllability matrix is a $2 \\times 2$ matrix given by:\n$$\nC = \\begin{bmatrix} B & AB \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe first column is the matrix $B$ itself. The second column is the product $AB$. We compute this product:\n$$\nAB = \\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1\\\\ 0 & 0\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\ 1\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} (0)(0) + (1)(1) \\\\ (0)(0) + (0)(1) \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}1\\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we assemble the controllability matrix $C$ by concatenating the columns $B$ and $AB$:\n$$\nC = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe Kalman rank condition states that the system is controllable if and only if the rank of the controllability matrix $C$ is equal to the dimension of the state space, $n$. Here, $n=2$. To find the rank of $C$, we can check for linear independence of its columns or compute its determinant. The columns of $C$ are $\\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\ 1\\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\begin{bmatrix}1\\\\ 0\\end{bmatrix}$, which are the standard basis vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and are manifestly linearly independent. Alternatively, we compute the determinant:\n$$\n\\det(C) = (0)(0) - (1)(1) = -1\n$$\nSince $\\det(C) \\neq 0$, the matrix $C$ is invertible and has full rank. The rank of the $2 \\times 2$ matrix $C$ is therefore $2$.\n$$\n\\text{rank}(C) = 2\n$$\nSince $\\text{rank}(C) = n = 2$, we conclude that the system is controllable.\n\nThe second task is to compute the finite-horizon controllability Gramian $W_{c}(T)$ and discuss its positive definiteness as a cross-check. The Gramian is defined as:\n$$\nW_{c}(T) = \\int_{0}^{T} e^{A\\tau} B B^T e^{A^T\\tau} d\\tau\n$$\nFirst, we must compute the state transition matrix, $e^{A\\tau}$, which is the matrix exponential. We can use the Taylor series expansion $e^{A\\tau} = I + A\\tau + \\frac{(A\\tau)^2}{2!} + \\cdots$. Let's compute the powers of $A$:\n$$\nA^2 = A \\cdot A = \\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1\\\\ 0 & 0\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1\\\\ 0 & 0\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nSince $A^2$ is the zero matrix, all higher powers $A^k$ for $k \\geq 2$ are also zero. The matrix $A$ is nilpotent. The series for the matrix exponential thus truncates after the linear term:\n$$\ne^{A\\tau} = I + A\\tau = \\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1\\end{bmatrix} + \\tau\\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1\\\\ 0 & 0\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}1 & \\tau\\\\ 0 & 1\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe transpose, $e^{A^T\\tau}$, is simply $(e^{A\\tau})^T$:\n$$\ne^{A^T\\tau} = \\begin{bmatrix}1 & \\tau\\\\ 0 & 1\\end{bmatrix}^T = \\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0\\\\ \\tau & 1\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we compute the matrix product $BB^T$:\n$$\nBB^T = \\begin{bmatrix}0\\\\ 1\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}0 & 1\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nNow we assemble the integrand $e^{A\\tau} B B^T e^{A^T\\tau}$:\n$$\ne^{A\\tau} B B^T e^{A^T\\tau} = \\begin{bmatrix}1 & \\tau\\\\ 0 & 1\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 1\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0\\\\ \\tau & 1\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n= \\begin{bmatrix}(1)(0)+(\\tau)(0) & (1)(0)+(\\tau)(1)\\\\ (0)(0)+(1)(0) & (0)(0)+(1)(1)\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0\\\\ \\tau & 1\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}0 & \\tau\\\\ 0 & 1\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0\\\\ \\tau & 1\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n= \\begin{bmatrix}(0)(1)+(\\tau)(\\tau) & (0)(0)+(\\tau)(1)\\\\ (0)(1)+(1)(\\tau) & (0)(0)+(1)(1)\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\\tau^2 & \\tau\\\\ \\tau & 1\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nFinally, we integrate this matrix from $\\tau=0$ to $\\tau=T$:\n$$\nW_{c}(T) = \\int_{0}^{T} \\begin{bmatrix}\\tau^2 & \\tau\\\\ \\tau & 1\\end{bmatrix} d\\tau = \\begin{bmatrix} \\int_{0}^{T}\\tau^2 d\\tau & \\int_{0}^{T}\\tau d\\tau \\\\ \\int_{0}^{T}\\tau d\\tau & \\int_{0}^{T}1 d\\tau \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n= \\begin{bmatrix} \\left[\\frac{\\tau^3}{3}\\right]_{0}^{T} & \\left[\\frac{\\tau^2}{2}\\right]_{0}^{T} \\\\ \\left[\\frac{\\tau^2}{2}\\right]_{0}^{T} & \\left[\\tau\\right]_{0}^{T} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{T^3}{3} & \\frac{T^2}{2} \\\\ \\frac{T^2}{2} & T \\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nA system is controllable if and only if its controllability Gramian $W_c(T)$ is positive definite for any $T>0$. A symmetric matrix is positive definite if all its leading principal minors are positive.\nThe first leading principal minor is the $(1,1)$ element: $\\frac{T^3}{3}$. For $T>0$, this is positive.\nThe second leading principal minor is the determinant of the matrix:\n$$\n\\det(W_c(T)) = \\left(\\frac{T^3}{3}\\right)(T) - \\left(\\frac{T^2}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{T^2}{2}\\right) = \\frac{T^4}{3} - \\frac{T^4}{4} = \\frac{4T^4 - 3T^4}{12} = \\frac{T^4}{12}\n$$\nFor $T>0$, the determinant is also positive. Since all leading principal minors are positive, $W_c(T)$ is positive definite for any $T>0$. This confirms the earlier conclusion from the rank test that the system is controllable.\n\nThe final answer is the rank of the controllability matrix $C$.",

            "solution": "The problem asks to determine if the continuous-time linear time-invariant (LTI) system, described by the state-space representation $\\dot{x}(t)=A x(t)+B u(t)$, is stabilizable.

A mode corresponds to an eigenvalue of the system matrix $A$. An eigenvalue $\\lambda$ is considered unstable if its real part is non-negative, i.e., $\\text{Re}(\\lambda) \\ge 0$.\n\nFirst, we must identify the eigenvalues of the system matrix $A$. The matrix $A$ is an upper-triangular matrix. A property of triangular matrices is that their eigenvalues are the entries on their main diagonal. Therefore, the eigenvalues of $A$ are:\n$$\n\\lambda_1 = -1, \\quad \\lambda_2 = -2, \\quad \\lambda_3 = -3, \\quad \\lambda_4 = \\alpha\n$$\nThe problem specifies that $\\alpha > 0$. We evaluate the stability of each mode:\n- $\\lambda_1 = -1$: Stable, as $\\text{Re}(\\lambda_1) < 0$.\n- $\\lambda_2 = -2$: Stable, as $\\text{Re}(\\lambda_2) < 0$.\n- $\\lambda_3 = -3$: Stable, as $\\text{Re}(\\lambda_3) < 0$.\n- $\\lambda_4 = \\alpha$: Unstable, as $\\text{Re}(\\lambda_4) = \\alpha > 0$.\n\nFor the system to be stabilizable, the single unstable mode associated with the eigenvalue $\\lambda_4 = \\alpha$ must be controllable. We can use the eigenvector test for controllability, which is a foundational method. A mode corresponding to an eigenvalue $\\lambda$ is uncontrollable if and only if there exists a left eigenvector $v$ of $A$ corresponding to $\\lambda$ that is orthogonal to the columns of $B$, i.e., $v^T B = 0$.\n\nLet $v_4 = \\begin{pmatrix} v_{41} & v_{42} & v_{43} & v_{44} \\end{pmatrix}^T$ be a left eigenvector of $A$ corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda_4 = \\alpha$. By definition, it must satisfy the equation $v_4^T A = \\lambda_4 v_4^T$, which is $v_4^T A = \\alpha v_4^T$.\nWriting this out component-wise:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} v_{41} & v_{42} & v_{43} & v_{44} \\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-1 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -2 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -3 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & \\alpha\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= \\alpha \\begin{pmatrix} v_{41} & v_{42} & v_{43} & v_{44} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis matrix equation yields a system of four linear equations:\n1. $-v_{41} = \\alpha v_{41} \\implies (1+\\alpha)v_{41} = 0$. Since $\\alpha > 0$, $(1+\\alpha) \\neq 0$, which implies $v_{41}=0$.\n2. $2v_{41} - 2v_{42} = \\alpha v_{42} \\implies 2v_{41} = (\\alpha+2)v_{42}$. Substituting $v_{41}=0$, we get $(\\alpha+2)v_{42} = 0$. Since $\\alpha > 0$, $(\\alpha+2) \\neq 0$, which implies $v_{42}=0$.\n3. $v_{42} - 3v_{43} = \\alpha v_{43} \\implies v_{42} = (\\alpha+3)v_{43}$. Substituting $v_{42}=0$, we get $(\\alpha+3)v_{43} = 0$. Since $\\alpha > 0$, $(\\alpha+3) \\neq 0$, which implies $v_{43}=0$.\n4. $\\alpha v_{44} = \\alpha v_{44}$, which simplifies to $0=0$. This equation does not constrain $v_{44}$.\n\nFor an eigenvector to be non-zero, we must have at least one non-zero component. We can choose $v_{44}=1$. Thus, the left eigenvector corresponding to $\\lambda_4=\\alpha$ is any non-zero scalar multiple of $v_4=\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}^T$.\n\nNow, we apply the eigenvector test for controllability by computing $v_4^T B$:\n$$\nv_4^T B = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= \\begin{pmatrix} (0)(1) + (0)(0) + (0)(0) + (1)(0) & (0)(0) + (0)(1) + (0)(0) + (1)(0) \\end{pmatrix}\n= \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSince $v_4^T B = 0^T$, the mode corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda_4 = \\alpha$ is uncontrollable.\nBecause there exists an unstable eigenvalue ($\\lambda_4 = \\alpha > 0$) that corresponds to an uncontrollable mode, the system $(A,B)$ is not stabilizable.\n\nThe failure mode is due to the network structure. The state matrix $A$ reveals that node $4$ is decoupled from the subgraph formed by nodes $1$, $2$, and $3$. Specifically, the fourth row of $A$ has zeros in the first three columns, meaning no links are directed towards node $4$ from any other node. The dynamics of state $x_4$ are governed solely by $\\dot{x}_4(t) = \\alpha x_4(t)$. The input matrix $B$ shows that the control inputs act on nodes $1$ and $2$, but not on node $4$ (the fourth row of $B$ is composed of zeros). Consequently, there is no path for the control signal to influence the state $x_4$, either directly or indirectly through the network. This makes the dynamics of $x_4$ impossible to alter.\n\nThe explicit goal of stabilization is to use state feedback, $u(t)=Kx(t)$, to place the eigenvalues of the closed-loop system matrix, $A_{CL} = A+BK$, in the open left-half of the complex plane. Let's examine $A+BK$:\n$$\nA+BK = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-1 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & -2 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & -3 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & \\alpha\n\\end{pmatrix} +\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 1 \\\\\n0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nk_{11} & k_{12} & k_{13} & k_{14} \\\\\nk_{21} & k_{22} & k_{23} & k_{24}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nA+BK = \\begin{pmatrix}\n-1+k_{11} & 2+k_{12} & k_{13} & k_{14} \\\\\nk_{21} & -2+k_{22} & 1+k_{23} & k_{24} \\\\\n0 & 0 & -3 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & \\alpha\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe resulting closed-loop matrix $A+BK$ remains upper-triangular. Its eigenvalues are its diagonal entries: $-1+k_{11}$, $-2+k_{22}$, $-3$, and $\\alpha$. While the feedback gains $k_{11}$ and $k_{22}$ can be chosen to arbitrarily place two of the eigenvalues, the eigenvalues $-3$ and $\\alpha$ are invariant under any state feedback. Since $\\alpha > 0$, the closed-loop system will always possess an unstable eigenvalue at $\\lambda=\\alpha$, irrespective of the choice of control.\n\nTherefore, the system is not stabilizable. The specific failure is the presence of the uncontrollable unstable eigenvalue $\\lambda = \\alpha$.",

The minimum eigenvalue is $\\lambda_{\\min}(W_4(4)) = 0$.\n\n**Comparison and Determination of $i^{\\star}$**\nWe now compare the minimum eigenvalues for each actuator placement:\n- $i=1$: $\\lambda_{\\min}(W_1(4)) = \\alpha^6$\n- $i=2$: $\\lambda_{\\min}(W_2(4)) = 0$\n- $i=3$: $\\lambda_{\\min}(W_3(4)) = 0$\n- $i=4$: $\\lambda_{\\min}(W_4(4)) = 0$\n\nThe objective is to find $i^{\\star} = \\arg\\max_{i \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}} \\lambda_{\\min}(W(4))$.\nWe are comparing the set of values $\\{\\alpha^6, 0, 0, 0\\}$. Since it is given that $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$, we have that $\\alpha^6 > 0$.\nThe maximum value in this set is $\\alpha^6$, which is achieved when the actuator is placed at node $1$ (i.e., for $i=1$).\nTherefore, $i^{\\star} = 1$.\n\n**Interpretation**\nThe matrix $A$ represents a network topology where node $i+1$ is influenced by node $i$, for $i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$. This is a directed chain graph: $1 \\to 2 \\to 3 \\to 4$. Node $1$ is the root of the chain.\n\nA system is controllable if the controllability Gramian $W(T)$ is positive definite, which is equivalent to $\\lambda_{\\min}(W(T)) > 0$ for a sufficiently large horizon $T$ (here $T=n=4$).\n- For $i \\in \\{2, 3, 4\\}$, we found $\\lambda_{\\min}(W(4))=0$. This indicates that the system is uncontrollable. This is because control authority can only propagate downstream in the directed chain. If the actuator is at node $2$, it can influence nodes $2, 3, 4$ but has no way to influence the state of node $1$. Similarly, an actuator at node $3$ cannot control nodes $1$ and $2$, and an actuator at node $4$ can only control itself. These unreachable states lead to an uncontrollable system.\n- For $i=1$, placing the actuator at the root of the chain, we found $\\lambda_{\\min}(W_1(4)) = \\alpha^6 > 0$. This indicates the system is controllable. A control input at node $1$ can propagate down the entire chain, reaching node $2$ in one time step, node $3$ in two, and node $4$ in three. Over the horizon $T=4$, every node in the network is reachable from the input at node $1$.\n\nThe quantity $\\lambda_{\\min}(W(T))$ is a measure of the \"degree\" of controllability. A larger value implies that the system can be driven to any state with less control energy. Since placing the actuator at any node other than the root results in an uncontrollable system ($\\lambda_{\\min}=0$), the only placement that yields any degree of controllability is at the root node, $i=1$. Consequently, this placement trivially maximizes $\\lambda_{\\min}(W(4))$, as it is the only placement for which this value is non-zero. The optimal actuator placement is at the node from which all other nodes are reachable, which in a directed chain is a unique root node.",
