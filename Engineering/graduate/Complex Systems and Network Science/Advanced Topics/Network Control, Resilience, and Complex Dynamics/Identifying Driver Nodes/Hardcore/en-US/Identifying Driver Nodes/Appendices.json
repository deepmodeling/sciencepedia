            "solution": "To determine the minimal number of driver nodes, we apply the structural controllability framework. The core principle is that the minimum number of driver nodes, $N_D$, needed to control a network of $N$ nodes is determined by the size of the maximum matching, $|M_{\\text{max}}|$, in the network's bipartite graph representation. The formula is $N_D = \\max(1, N - |M_{\\text{max}}|)$. The driver nodes correspond to the original network nodes that are unmatched in the maximum matching.\n\nThe process involves three steps:\n1.  Construct the associated bipartite graph.\n2.  Find a maximum matching in this bipartite graph.\n3.  Identify the unmatched nodes to determine the driver nodes and their count.\n\n**Step 1: Construct the Bipartite Graph**\n\nThe original directed network has $N=8$ nodes, $V = \\{v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_8\\}$, and a set of directed edges $E$. We construct a bipartite graph $B = (L \\cup R, E_B)$. The two partitions of nodes, $L$ and $R$, are copies of the original node set $V$.\nThe left partition is $L = \\{v_1^L, v_2^L, \\dots, v_8^L\\}$.\nThe right partition is $R = \\{v_1^R, v_2^R, \\dots, v_8^R\\}$.\n\nA bipartite edge $(v_i^L, v_j^R)$ exists in the edge set $E_B$ if and only if there is a directed edge $(v_i \\to v_j)$ in the original network's edge set $E$.\nThe given edge set is:\n$E = \\{ (v_1 \\to v_2),\\ (v_1 \\to v_5),\\ (v_2 \\to v_3),\\ (v_3 \\to v_4),\\ (v_4 \\to v_2),\\ (v_5 \\to v_3),\\ (v_5 \\to v_6),\\ (v_6 \\to v_5),\\ (v_7 \\to v_4),\\ (v_7 \\to v_8),\\ (v_8 \\to v_7) \\}$.\n\nFrom this, we construct the bipartite edge set $E_B$:\n$$\nE_B = \\{(v_1^L, v_2^R),\\ (v_1^L, v_5^R),\\ (v_2^L, v_3^R),\\ (v_3^L, v_4^R),\\ (v_4^L, v_2^R),\\ (v_5^L, v_3^R),\\ (v_5^L, v_6^R),\\ (v_6^L, v_5^R),\\ (v_7^L, v_4^R),\\ (v_7^L, v_8^R),\\ (v_8^L, v_7^R)\\}\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Find a Maximum Matching**\n\nA matching $M$ is a subset of $E_B$ such that no two edges in $M$ share a common vertex. A maximum matching has the largest possible number of edges. We can find one by identifying a large matching and then proving its maximality by showing the absence of any augmenting paths. An augmenting path alternates between edges not in the matching and edges in the matching, starting from an unmatched node in $L$ and ending at an unmatched node in $R$.\n\nConsider the following set of edges, which we propose as a matching $M$:\n$$\nM = \\{(v_2^L, v_3^R),\\ (v_3^L, v_4^R),\\ (v_4^L, v_2^R),\\ (v_5^L, v_6^R),\\ (v_6^L, v_5^R),\\ (v_7^L, v_8^R),\\ (v_8^L, v_7^R)\\}\n$$\nThis is a valid matching, as no node is an endpoint of more than one edge in $M$. The size of this matching is $|M| = 7$.\n\nTo justify that this is a maximum matching, we use Berge's theorem, which states that a matching $M$ is maximum if and only if there are no $M$-augmenting paths.\n\nFirst, we identify the nodes that are unmatched by $M$:\nThe set of matched nodes in $L$ is $\\{v_2^L, v_3^L, v_4^L, v_5^L, v_6^L, v_7^L, v_8^L\\}$.\nThe set of matched nodes in $R$ is $\\{v_2^R, v_3^R, v_4^R, v_5^R, v_6^R, v_7^R, v_8^R\\}$.\n\nThe set of unmatched nodes in $L$ is $U_L = L \\setminus \\{v_2^L, \\dots, v_8^L\\} = \\{v_1^L\\}$.\nThe set of unmatched nodes in $R$ is $U_R = R \\setminus \\{v_2^R, \\dots, v_8^R\\} = \\{v_1^R\\}$.\n\nAn augmenting path must start from a node in $U_L$ and end in a node in $U_R$. Thus, we only need to search for an alternating path starting at $v_1^L$ and ending at $v_1^R$.\n\nLet's build an alternating path tree starting from $v_1^L$:\n1.  Start at the unmatched node $v_1^L$.\n2.  Follow an edge not in $M$. The node $v_1^L$ has two outgoing edges in $E_B$: $(v_1^L, v_2^R)$ and $(v_1^L, v_5^R)$. Both are not in $M$. We explore both possibilities.\n    *   **Case A:** Follow the path $v_1^L \\xrightarrow{\\notin M} v_2^R$. The node $v_2^R$ is matched in $M$ with $v_4^L$ via the edge $(v_4^L, v_2^R)$. We must follow this edge back: $v_1^L \\xrightarrow{\\notin M} v_2^R \\xleftarrow{\\in M} v_4^L$. Now, from $v_4^L$, we must follow an edge not in $M$. The only edge connected to $v_4^L$ is $(v_4^L, v_2^R)$, which is in $M$. Thus, this search branch terminates without finding an augmenting path.\n    *   **Case B:** Follow the path $v_1^L \\xrightarrow{\\notin M} v_5^R$. The node $v_5^R$ is matched in $M$ with $v_6^L$ via the edge $(v_6^L, v_5^R)$. We must follow this edge back: $v_1^L \\xrightarrow{\\notin M} v_5^R \\xleftarrow{\\in M} v_6^L$. Now, from $v_6^L$, we must follow an edge not in $M$. The only edge connected to $v_6^L$ is $(v_6^L, v_5^R)$, which is in $M$. This search branch also terminates.\n\nSince all possible alternating paths starting from the only unmatched node in $L$ terminate without reaching an unmatched node in $R$, no $M$-augmenting path exists. By Berge's theorem, $M$ is a maximum matching.\nTherefore, the size of the maximum matching is $|M_{\\text{max}}| = |M| = 7$.\n\n**Step 3: Identify Unmatched Nodes and Driver Set**\n\nThe theory of structural controllability dictates that the minimal set of driver nodes corresponds to the set of nodes in the original graph that are unmatched on the right side ($R$) of the bipartite graph.\n\nThe set of nodes in the right partition is $R = \\{v_1^R, v_2^R, v_3^R, v_4^R, v_5^R, v_6^R, v_7^R, v_8^R\\}$.\nThe set of nodes in $R$ matched by our maximum matching $M$ is:\n$$\nR_{\\text{matched}} = \\{v_2^R, v_3^R, v_4^R, v_5^R, v_6^R, v_7^R, v_8^R\\}\n$$\nThe set of unmatched nodes in $R$ is $U_R = R \\setminus R_{\\text{matched}} = \\{v_1^R\\}$. This corresponds to the node $v_1$ in the original network, making $\\{v_1\\}$ a minimal set of driver nodes.\n\nThe minimal number of driver nodes, $N_D$, is the cardinality of this set. This result is consistent with the formula $N_D = \\max(1, N - |M_{\\text{max}}|) = \\max(1, 8 - 7) = 1$.\nThe minimal number of driver nodes required is $1$.",

No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The minimum number of driver nodes, $N_D$, for structural controllability is determined by the size of the maximum matching, $|M^{*}|$, in the network's bipartite graph representation. The formula is:\n$$N_{D} = \\max(1, n - |M^{*}|)$$\nwhere $n$ is the number of nodes in the network. A directed graph $\\mathcal{G} = (V, E)$ with $n$ nodes is represented by a bipartite graph $\\mathcal{B} = (V_{out} \\cup V_{in}, E_{\\mathcal{B}})$. The vertex sets are copies of the original nodes: $V_{out} = \\{v_0', v_1', \\dots, v_{n-1}'\\}$ and $V_{in} = \\{v_0, v_1, \\dots, v_{n-1}\\}$. A directed edge from node $v_j$ to node $v_i$ in $\\mathcal{G}$ corresponds to an edge from $v_j'$ to $v_i$ in $\\mathcal{B}$. The number of required drivers is the number of unmatched nodes in the right-side partition $V_{in}$, which is $n - |M^{*}|$. We apply this framework to both the out-star and in-star networks, where $n = m+1$.\n\n**Analysis of Network $\\mathcal{G}_{\\text{out}}$ (Directed Out-Star)**\n\nFor network $\\mathcal{G}_{\\text{out}}$, the node set is $V = \\{v_0, v_1, \\dots, v_m\\}$. The edges are $(v_0, v_i)$ for $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, m\\}$. In the corresponding bipartite graph $\\mathcal{B}_{\\text{out}}$, these edges become $(v_0', v_i)$. The node $v_0'$ in the left partition is connected to $m$ nodes in the right partition: $\\{v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_m\\}$. Nodes $\\{v_1', \\dots, v_m'\\}$ in the left partition have no outgoing edges.\n\nTo find a maximum matching in $\\mathcal{B}_{\\text{out}}$, we note that all edges emanate from a single node $v_0'$ in the left partition. Therefore, we can select at most one edge for the matching, for instance, $(v_0', v_k)$ for some $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, m\\}$.\nThe size of the maximum matching is $|M_{\\text{out}}^{*}| = 1$.\n\nUsing the formula for the minimum number of driver nodes, with $n=m+1$:\n$$N_{D}(\\mathcal{G}_{\\text{out}}) = \\max(1, n - |M_{\\text{out}}^{*}|) = \\max(1, (m+1) - 1) = \\max(1, m)$$\nSince the problem implies $m \\ge 1$ (leaves are indexed from $1$ to $m$), we have $N_D(\\mathcal{G}_{\\text{out}}) = m$.\n\n**Analysis of Network $\\mathcal{G}_{\\text{in}}$ (Directed In-Star)**\n\nFor network $\\mathcal{G}_{\\text{in}}$, the node set is the same, but the edges are $(v_i, v_0)$ for $i \\in \\{1, \\dots, m\\}$. In the bipartite graph $\\mathcal{B}_{\\text{in}}$, these edges become $(v_i', v_0)$. The nodes $\\{v_1', \\dots, v_m'\\}$ in the left partition are all connected to the single node $v_0$ in the right partition. The node $v_0'$ in the left partition has no outgoing edges.\n\nTo find the maximum matching in $\\mathcal{B}_{\\text{in}}$, we observe that all edges terminate at a single node $v_0$ in the right partition. We can select at most one edge for our matching, for instance, $(v_k', v_0)$ for some $k \\in \\{1, \\dots, m\\}$.\nThe size of the maximum matching is $|M_{\\text{in}}^{*}| = 1$.\n\nUsing the formula for the minimum number of driver nodes, with $n=m+1$:\n$$N_{D}(\\mathcal{G}_{\\text{in}}) = \\max(1, n - |M_{\\text{in}}^{*}|) = \\max(1, (m+1) - 1) = \\max(1, m)$$\nAs before, for $m \\ge 1$, we have $N_D(\\mathcal{G}_{\\text{in}}) = m$.\n\n**Asymmetry due to Edge Direction**\n\nThe calculations reveal that the minimal number of driver nodes is the same for both networks: $N_D = m$. However, a significant asymmetry exists in the *identity* of the nodes that must be controlled.\n\nFor $\\mathcal{G}_{\\text{in}}$ (in-star), the leaves $\\{v_1, \\dots, v_m\\}$ have an in-degree of zero. They are not influenced by any other node and must be driven directly. The hub $v_0$ is controlled indirectly via its connections from the leaves. Thus, the set of driver nodes is uniquely determined as the set of $m$ leaves.\n\nFor $\\mathcal{G}_{\\text{out}}$ (out-star), the situation is more subtle. The hub, $v_0$, has an in-degree of zero. However, driving only this node is insufficient for $m>1$. To achieve full control over the $n=m+1$ dimensional state space, $m$ inputs are required. A valid set of $m$ driver nodes would be the hub and any $m-1$ leaves. Unlike the in-star, the minimal driver set is not unique.\n\nIn summary, despite the identical requirement of $m$ driver nodes, the reversal of edge directions creates a fundamental asymmetry in the identity and uniqueness of the driver set.\n\nThe final answer requires only the number of driver nodes for each case.\nFor $\\mathcal{G}_{\\text{out}}$, $N_D = m$.\nFor $\\mathcal{G}_{\\text{in}}$, $N_D = m$.",
