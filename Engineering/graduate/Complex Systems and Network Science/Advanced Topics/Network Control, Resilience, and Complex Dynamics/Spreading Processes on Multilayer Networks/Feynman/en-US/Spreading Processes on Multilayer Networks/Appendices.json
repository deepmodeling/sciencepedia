This approach simplifies the complex network structure by assuming that every node interacts uniformly with every other node. By deriving the endemic prevalence for a Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) process under this assumption, you will see how a multiplex system can be reduced to an equivalent single-layer network . This exercise serves as a crucial baseline, illustrating both the core principles of disease modeling and the significant limitations of ignoring detailed network topology.",

            "problem": "Consider a $2$-layer multiplex network with a common node set of size $N$, represented by undirected, simple adjacency matrices $A^{(1)}$ and $A^{(2)}$ with no self-loops. Let the average degree in layer $1$ be $k^{(1)} \\equiv \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i,j} A^{(1)}_{ij}$ and in layer $2$ be $k^{(2)} \\equiv \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i,j} A^{(2)}_{ij}$. A Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) spreading process evolves on this multiplex as follows: each susceptible node acquires infection from each infected neighbor in layer $\\ell \\in \\{1,2\\}$ at rate $\\beta_{\\ell}$ per contact, and each infected node recovers at rate $\\mu_{\\ell}$, returning to the susceptible state. Assume homogeneous mixing in the mean-field sense: at any time $t$, the probability that a node is infected is the same for all nodes and equal to $x(t)$, and dynamic state correlations across nodes and layers are neglected. Suppose further that $\\beta_{1}=\\beta_{2}=\\beta$ and $\\mu_{1}=\\mu_{2}=\\mu$, with parameters such that a nontrivial endemic equilibrium exists.\n\nStarting from first principles of the mean-field balance of infection and recovery fluxes, derive the closed-form expression for the endemic prevalence $x^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{multi}}$ on the multiplex.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the established theory of epidemic spreading on networks, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and is formulated using objective, formal language. It represents a standard problem in network science.\n\nWe are tasked with deriving the endemic prevalence for a Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) process on a $2$-layer multiplex network and an equivalent single-layer network, under a homogeneous mean-field approximation.\n\nLet $x(t)$ be the fraction of infected nodes in the population of size $N$ at time $t$. In a mean-field framework, the rate of change of $x(t)$ is governed by the balance between the infection flux and the recovery flux:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = (\\text{rate of new infections per capita}) - (\\text{rate of recoveries per capita})\n$$\n\n### Part 1: Endemic Prevalence on the Multiplex Network ($x^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{multi}}$)\n\nThe rate of recovery per capita involves infected nodes returning to the susceptible state. Since a fraction $x$ of nodes are infected and each recovers at a rate $\\mu$ (as $\\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = \\mu$), the recovery flux is $\\mu x$.\n\nThe rate of new infections per capita involves susceptible nodes becoming infected. The fraction of susceptible nodes is $(1-x)$. A susceptible node can be infected by its neighbors in either layer $1$ or layer $2$.\n\nUnder the homogeneous mean-field approximation, we assume that the probability of any neighbor being infected is simply the global prevalence $x$. The infection force on a susceptible node is the sum of the rates of exposure from all its neighbors. For a randomly chosen node, the average number of neighbors in layer $\\ell$ is the average degree $k^{(\\ell)}$.\n\nThe infection rate from a single infected neighbor is $\\beta$ (as $\\beta_1 = \\beta_2 = \\beta$) in both layers.\nThe total infection force, $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{multi}}$, experienced by a susceptible node is the sum of forces from both layers:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\mathrm{multi}} = (\\text{infection rate from layer 1}) + (\\text{infection rate from layer 2})\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\mathrm{multi}} = \\beta \\times (\\text{avg. neighbors in layer 1}) \\times (\\text{prob. neighbor is infected}) + \\beta \\times (\\text{avg. neighbors in layer 2}) \\times (\\text{prob. neighbor is infected})\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\mathrm{multi}} = \\beta k^{(1)} x + \\beta k^{(2)} x = \\beta (k^{(1)} + k^{(2)}) x\n$$\nThe rate of new infections per capita is the product of the fraction of susceptible individuals and this infection force:\n$$\n(\\text{rate of new infections per capita}) = (1-x) \\lambda_{\\mathrm{multi}} = (1-x) \\beta (k^{(1)} + k^{(2)}) x\n$$\nCombining the infection and recovery terms, we obtain the mean-field rate equation for the multiplex system:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\beta (k^{(1)} + k^{(2)}) x(1-x) - \\mu x\n$$\nAt equilibrium, $\\frac{dx}{dt} = 0$. This yields two solutions:\n$$\nx \\left( \\beta (k^{(1)} + k^{(2)}) (1-x) - \\mu \\right) = 0\n$$\nOne solution is $x=0$, which corresponds to the disease-free equilibrium (DFE). The problem states that a nontrivial endemic equilibrium exists, which corresponds to the second solution where the term in the parenthesis is zero:\n$$\n\\beta (k^{(1)} + k^{(2)}) (1-x^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{multi}}) - \\mu = 0\n$$\nSolving for the endemic prevalence $x^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{multi}}$:\n$$\n1-x^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{multi}} = \\frac{\\mu}{\\beta (k^{(1)} + k^{(2)})}\n$$\n$$\nx^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{multi}} = 1 - \\frac{\\mu}{\\beta (k^{(1)} + k^{(2)})}\n$$\n\n### Part 2: Endemic Prevalence on the Single-Layer Network ($x^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{single}}$)\n\nNext, we consider a single-layer network with the same infection rate $\\beta$, recovery rate $\\mu$, and an average degree $k_{\\mathrm{single}} = k^{(1)} + k^{(2)}$. The mean-field dynamics for this single-layer network can be derived using the same logic.\n\nThe recovery flux is again $\\mu x$.\nThe infection force on a susceptible node is $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{single}} = \\beta k_{\\mathrm{single}} x$.\nSubstituting $k_{\\mathrm{single}} = k^{(1)} + k^{(2)}$, we get:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\mathrm{single}} = \\beta (k^{(1)} + k^{(2)}) x\n$$\nThe rate of new infections per capita is $(1-x) \\lambda_{\\mathrm{single}} = (1-x) \\beta (k^{(1)} + k^{(2)}) x$.\nThe rate equation is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\beta (k^{(1)} + k^{(2)}) x(1-x) - \\mu x\n$$\nThis equation is identical to the one derived for the multiplex network. Consequently, the nontrivial endemic equilibrium prevalence, $x^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{single}}$, must also be identical. Solving for the endemic state $x^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{single}} \\neq 0$:\n$$\n\\beta (k^{(1)} + k^{(2)}) (1-x^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{single}}) - \\mu = 0\n$$\n$$\nx^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{single}} = 1 - \\frac{\\mu}{\\beta (k^{(1)} + k^{(2)})}\n$$\nThis result highlights that, within the homogeneous mean-field approximation, the dynamics on the multiplex network are indistinguishable from the dynamics on a single-layer network whose average degree is the sum of the average degrees of the multiplex layers. This approximation effectively ignores the detailed layer structure.\n\n### Part 3: The Difference $\\Delta$\n\nFinally, we compute the difference $\\Delta \\equiv x^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{multi}} - x^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{single}}$.\nUsing the expressions derived above:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\mu}{\\beta (k^{(1)} + k^{(2)})} \\right) - \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\mu}{\\beta (k^{(1)} + k^{(2)})} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta = 0\n$$\nThe difference is exactly zero.\n\nThe three requested quantities are $x^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{multi}}$, $x^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{single}}$, and $\\Delta$.

Each layer is an independent configuration model random graph with Poisson degree distribution: layer $1$ has mean degree $z_{1}$ and layer $2$ has mean degree $z_{2}$. A Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) spreading process (SIR) maps to bond percolation, where the probability that an infection (equivalently, a bond) transmits along an edge depends on the edge’s layer and on whether the contagion switches layers at a node. Specifically, intra-layer transmission along a layer-$i$ edge occurs with probability $T_{i}$, and a layer switch at a node followed by transmission along an edge in the other layer occurs with probability $T_{12}$, assumed symmetric for switching either from layer $1$ to layer $2$ or from layer $2$ to layer $1$.

The use of the configuration model, Poisson degree distributions, bond percolation, and multitype branching processes are standard and rigorous formalisms in this field.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary parameters ($z_1$, $z_2$, $T_1$, $T_2$, $T_{12}$) and a clear objective: derive the branching matrix and then find the critical interlayer transmissibility $T_{12}^{c}$. The conditions under which the solution is sought are explicitly stated.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, unambiguous scientific language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It represents a standard, non-trivial problem in statistical physics and network science. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the multilayer branching matrix and the subsequent calculation of the critical interlayer transmissibility, $T_{12}^{c}$.\n\nThe spreading process can be modeled as a multitype branching process, where the \"individuals\" are infected edges and their \"type\" corresponds to the layer they belong to (layer $1$ or layer $2$). The process evolves in discrete generations, tracking the expected number of newly infected edges. The branching matrix, $\\mathbf{M}$, is a $2 \\times 2$ matrix whose element $M_{ij}$ is the average number of new infections spreading along layer-$j$ edges from a node that was just infected via a layer-$i$ edge.\n\nFirst, we derive the elements of the branching matrix $\\mathbf{M} = \\begin{pmatrix} M_{11} & M_{12} \\\\ M_{21} & M_{22} \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**Diagonal elements ($M_{11}$ and $M_{22}$):**\nThe element $M_{11}$ represents the expected number of secondary infections in layer $1$ originating from a node just infected via a layer-$1$ edge. When we trace an infection along a random edge in the configuration model, the node we arrive at does not have the original degree distribution. Its degree distribution is proportional to $k P(k)$, where $P(k)$ is the original degree distribution. The number of other edges connected to this node is its excess degree, $k-1$.\n\nFor a Poisson degree distribution $P(k) = \\exp(-z) z^k / k!$, the mean degree is $\\langle k \\rangle = z$. The excess degree distribution is given by $P_{ex}(k') = \\frac{(k'+1)P(k'+1)}{\\langle k \\rangle} = \\frac{(k'+1) \\exp(-z) z^{k'+1}}{(k'+1)! z} = \\frac{\\exp(-z) z^{k'}}{k'!}$. This is also a Poisson distribution with the same mean $z$.\n\nSo, if we arrive at a node via a layer-$1$ edge, its number of other layer-$1$ edges follows a Poisson distribution with mean $z_{1}$. Each of these edges transmits the infection independently with probability $T_1$. The expected number of new infections in layer 1 is the mean of the excess degree distribution multiplied by the transmission probability:\n$$\nM_{11} = z_{1} T_{1}\n$$\nBy symmetry, for an infection arriving via a layer-$2$ edge, the expected number of new infections within layer 2 is:\n$$\nM_{22} = z_{2} T_{2}\n$$\n\n**Off-diagonal elements ($M_{12}$ and $M_{21}$):**\nThe element $M_{12}$ is the expected number of secondary infections in layer $2$, given the primary infection arrived via a layer-$1$ edge. Because the layer degrees are independent, arriving at a node via a layer-$1$ edge provides no information about its degree in layer $2$. Therefore, the degree of this node in layer $2$, say $k_2$, follows the original layer-$2$ degree distribution, which is Poisson with mean $z_2$.\n\nThe problem states that a layer switch followed by transmission occurs with probability $T_{12}$. This is the probability for each of the $k_2$ edges in layer $2$ to cause a new infection. The expected number of new infections in layer $2$ is the mean degree in layer $2$ multiplied by this transmission probability:\n$$\nM_{12} = \\langle k_2 \\rangle T_{12} = z_{2} T_{12}\n$$\nSymmetrically, for $M_{21}$, we consider an infection arriving via a layer-$2$ edge. The degree of the reached node in layer $1$, $k_1$, follows the original layer-$1$ distribution with mean $z_1$. The expected number of new infections in layer $1$ is:\n$$\nM_{21} = \\langle k_1 \\rangle T_{12} = z_{1} T_{12}\n$$\n\nCombining these elements, the multilayer branching matrix is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{M} = \\begin{pmatrix} z_{1} T_{1} & z_{2} T_{12} \\\\ z_{1} T_{12} & z_{2} T_{2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe percolation transition occurs when the largest eigenvalue, $\\lambda_{\\max}$, of $\\mathbf{M}$ is equal to $1$. The eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are found by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(\\mathbf{M} - \\lambda \\mathbf{I}) = 0$:\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} z_{1} T_{1} - \\lambda & z_{2} T_{12} \\\\ z_{1} T_{12} & z_{2} T_{2} - \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0\n$$\n$$\n(z_{1} T_{1} - \\lambda)(z_{2} T_{2} - \\lambda) - (z_{1} T_{12})(z_{2} T_{12}) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda^2 - (z_{1} T_{1} + z_{2} T_{2})\\lambda + (z_{1} T_{1})(z_{2} T_{2}) - z_{1} z_{2} T_{12}^2 = 0\n$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $\\lambda$.

The condition for instability is:\n$$\n\\beta \\lambda_{\\max}(M) - \\mu \\;>\\; 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{\\beta}{\\mu} \\lambda_{\\max}(M) \\;>\\; 1 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\tau \\lambda_{\\max}(M) \\;>\\; 1\n$$\nThis is the epidemic threshold condition. The threshold is at $\\tau_c = 1/\\lambda_{\\max}(M)$.\n\nTo find the steady-state outbreak size, we set $\\frac{dp_i}{dt} = 0$:\n$$\n\\mu p_i \\;=\\; \\beta (1 - p_i) \\sum_{j} M_{ij} p_j\n$$\nThe problem asks for a one-dimensional coarse-graining and a homogeneous closure. This implies two approximations:\n1. The infection profile is proportional to the principal eigenvector $v_1$ of $M$: $\\vec{p} \\approx S \\vec{v_1}$.\n2. The term $(1-p_i)$ is replaced by a global average $(1-S_{\\mathrm{pred}})$, where $S_{\\mathrm{pred}}$ is the average fraction of infected nodes.\n\nApplying the second approximation (homogeneous closure) to the steady-state equation gives:\n$$\n\\mu p_i \\;\\approx\\; \\beta (1 - S_{\\mathrm{pred}}) \\sum_{j} M_{ij} p_j\n$$\nIn vector form: $\\mu \\vec{p} \\approx \\beta (1 - S_{\\mathrm{pred}}) M \\vec{p}$. This can be rewritten as an eigenvalue equation:\n$$\nM \\vec{p} \\;\\approx\\; \\frac{\\mu}{\\beta (1 - S_{\\mathrm{pred}})} \\vec{p}\n$$\nFor a non-trivial steady state ($\\vec{p} \\neq \\vec{0}$), the term on the right must be an eigenvalue of $M$. For an outbreak to emerge from the DFE, $\\vec{p}$ must be the principal eigenvector, and thus the scalar must be the largest eigenvalue, $\\lambda_{\\max}(M)$.\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\max}(M) \\;=\\; \\frac{\\mu}{\\beta (1 - S_{\\mathrm{pred}})} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{\\tau (1 - S_{\\mathrm{pred}})}\n$$\nSolving for the predicted outbreak size $S_{\\mathrm{pred}}$:\n$$\n\\tau \\lambda_{\\max}(M) (1 - S_{\\mathrm{pred}}) \\;=\\; 1 \\quad \\implies \\quad 1 - S_{\\mathrm{pred}} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{\\tau \\lambda_{\\max}(M)} \\quad \\implies \\quad S_{\\mathrm{pred}} \\;=\\; 1 - \\frac{1}{\\tau \\lambda_{\\max}(M)}\n$$\nThis is the required analytic expression for the predicted outbreak size, which we denote $S_{\\mathrm{pred}}(\\tau, \\lambda)$, where $\\lambda = \\lambda_{\\max}(M)$.\n\n**2.2. Eigenvalue Calculations**\nFirst, we find the eigenvalues of the intralayer matrix $A$. The matrix $A$ is the adjacency matrix of a complete graph $K_3$ with self-loops removed. $A = J - I_3$, where $J$ is the $3 \\times 3$ all-ones matrix. The eigenvalues of $J$ are $\\{3, 0, 0\\}$. The eigenvalues of $A$ are thus $\\{3-1, 0-1, 0-1\\} = \\{2, -1, -1\\}$. The largest eigenvalue for the single-layer system is:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\max}(A) \\;=\\; 2\n$$\nNext, we find the eigenvalues of the supra-adjacency matrix $A^{\\mathrm{sup}}$. Let $v$ be an eigenvector of $A$ with eigenvalue $\\lambda_A$. We look for eigenvectors of $A^{\\mathrm{sup}}$ of the form $\\begin{pmatrix} v \\\\ \\alpha v \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$$\nA^{\\mathrm{sup}} \\begin{pmatrix} v \\\\ \\alpha v \\end{pmatrix} \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix} A & \\omega I_3 \\\\ \\omega I_3 & A \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v \\\\ \\alpha v \\end{pmatrix} \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix} Av + \\omega (\\alpha v) \\\\ \\omega v + A(\\alpha v) \\end{pmatrix} \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix} (\\lambda_A + \\alpha \\omega)v \\\\ (\\omega + \\alpha \\lambda_A)v \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor this to be an eigenvector with eigenvalue $\\Lambda$, we must have $\\Lambda \\begin{pmatrix} v \\\\ \\alpha v \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\Lambda v \\\\ \\Lambda \\alpha v \\end{pmatrix}$. This gives two equations:\n$$\n\\Lambda \\;=\\; \\lambda_A + \\alpha \\omega\n$$\n$$\n\\Lambda \\alpha \\;=\\; \\omega + \\alpha \\lambda_A \\quad \\implies \\quad \\Lambda \\;=\\; \\frac{\\omega}{\\alpha} + \\lambda_A\n$$\nEquating the expressions for $\\Lambda$ yields $\\alpha \\omega = \\frac{\\omega}{\\alpha}$, which since $\\omega = \\frac{1}{2} \\neq 0$ implies $\\alpha^2 = 1$, so $\\alpha = \\pm 1$.\n- For $\\alpha=1$, the eigenvalues are $\\Lambda_+ = \\lambda_A + \\omega$.\n- For $\\alpha=-1$, the eigenvalues are $\\Lambda_- = \\lambda_A - \\omega$.\nUsing the eigenvalues of $A$, $\\{2, -1, -1\\}$, and $\\omega = \\frac{1}{2}$:\n- From $\\lambda_A = 2$: $\\Lambda = 2 \\pm \\frac{1}{2}$, giving $\\{2.5, 1.5\\}$.\n- From $\\lambda_A = -1$: $\\Lambda = -1 \\pm \\frac{1}{2}$, giving $\\{-0.5, -1.5\\}$. Since $\\lambda_A = -1$ has multiplicity $2$, so do these derived eigenvalues.\nThe set of eigenvalues of $A^{\\mathrm{sup}}$ is $\\{2.5, 1.5, -0.5, -0.5, -1.5, -1.5\\}$. The largest eigenvalue is:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\max}(A^{\\mathrm{sup}}) \\;=\\; 2.5 \\;=\\; \\frac{5}{2}\n$$\n\n**2.3. Outbreak Size and Relative Error Calculation**\nThe infection-to-recovery ratio is $\\tau = \\frac{\\beta}{\\mu} = \\frac{3/5}{1/5} = 3$.\n\n- **Full System (two layers)**:\nThe relevant adjacency operator is $A^{\\mathrm{sup}}$, with $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{full}} = \\lambda_{\\max}(A^{\\mathrm{sup}}) = \\frac{5}{2}$. The threshold parameter is $\\tau \\lambda_{\\mathrm{full}} = 3 \\times \\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{15}{2} = 7.5 > 1$, so an outbreak occurs.\nThe predicted outbreak size is:\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{full}} \\;=\\; 1 - \\frac{1}{\\tau \\lambda_{\\mathrm{full}}} \\;=\\; 1 - \\frac{1}{3 \\times \\frac{5}{2}} \\;=\\; 1 - \\frac{1}{\\frac{15}{2}} \\;=\\; 1 - \\frac{2}{15} \\;=\\; \\frac{13}{15}\n$$\n\n- **Missing Layer System (one layer)**:\nThe relevant adjacency operator is $A$, with $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{miss}} = \\lambda_{\\max}(A) = 2$. The threshold parameter is $\\tau \\lambda_{\\mathrm{miss}} = 3 \\times 2 = 6 > 1$, so an outbreak occurs.\nThe predicted outbreak size is:\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{miss}} \\;=\\; 1 - \\frac{1}{\\tau \\lambda_{\\mathrm{miss}}} \\;=\\; 1 - \\frac{1}{3 \\times 2} \\;=\\; 1 - \\frac{1}{6} \\;=\\; \\frac{5}{6}\n$$\n\n- **Relative Error**:\nWe now compute the relative error $E_{\\mathrm{rel}}$.\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{rel}} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\big|\\,S_{\\mathrm{full}} - S_{\\mathrm{miss}}\\,\\big|}{S_{\\mathrm{full}}} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\left| \\frac{13}{15} - \\frac{5}{6} \\right|}{\\frac{13}{15}}\n$$\nFirst, find the difference in the numerator. The common denominator is $30$.\n$$\n\\frac{13}{15} - \\frac{5}{6} \\;=\\; \\frac{13 \\times 2}{15 \\times 2} - \\frac{5 \\times 5}{6 \\times 5} \\;=\\; \\frac{26}{30} - \\frac{25}{30} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{30}\n$$\nNow, substitute this back into the expression for $E_{\\mathrm{rel}}$:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{rel}} \\;=\\; \\frac{\\frac{1}{30}}{\\frac{13}{15}} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{30} \\times \\frac{15}{13} \\;=\\; \\frac{15}{30 \\times 13} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{2 \\times 13} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{26}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the answer as a decimal or a fraction. The exact fraction is $\\frac{1}{26}$.\nAs a decimal rounded to four significant figures, $\\frac{1}{26} \\approx 0.0384615...$, which is $0.03846$. The fractional form is exact.",
