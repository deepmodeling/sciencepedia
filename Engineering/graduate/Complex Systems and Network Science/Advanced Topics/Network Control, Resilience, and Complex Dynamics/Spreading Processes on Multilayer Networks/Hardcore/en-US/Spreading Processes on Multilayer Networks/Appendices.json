This practice will guide you through deriving this epidemic threshold on a multiplex network using the powerful formalism of multitype branching processes .

            "problem": "Consider a multiplex network with two layers that share the same node set. Each layer is an independent configuration model random graph with Poisson degree distribution: layer $1$ has mean degree $z_{1}$ and layer $2$ has mean degree $z_{2}$. A Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) spreading process (SIR) maps to bond percolation, where the probability that an infection (equivalently, a bond) transmits along an edge depends on the edge’s layer and on whether the contagion switches layers at a node. Specifically, intra-layer transmission along a layer-$i$ edge occurs with probability $T_{i}$, and a layer switch at a node followed by transmission along an edge in the other layer occurs with probability $T_{12}$, assumed symmetric for switching either from layer $1$ to layer $2$ or from layer $2$ to layer $1$. Assume layer degrees are independent across layers.\n\nThe emergence of a giant connected component in bond percolation on this multiplex can be analyzed via a multitype branching process whose types are the layers of the edge used to arrive at a node. The percolation transition occurs when the largest eigenvalue of the $2 \\times 2$ multilayer branching matrix exceeds $1$.\n\nStarting from first principles of the configuration model and excess degree arguments, derive the appropriate multilayer branching matrix for this system. Using the condition that the percolation threshold occurs when the largest eigenvalue equals $1$, obtain a closed-form analytic expression for the critical interlayer transmissibility $T_{12}^{c}$ that triggers a giant component when both layers are individually subcritical, i.e., when $T_{1} z_{1}  1$ and $T_{2} z_{2}  1$. Provide your final answer as a single closed-form expression in terms of $T_{1}$, $T_{2}$, $z_{1}$, and $z_{2}$. No numerical evaluation is required.",

The use of the configuration model, Poisson degree distributions, bond percolation, and multitype branching processes are standard and rigorous formalisms in this field.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary parameters ($z_1$, $z_2$, $T_1$, $T_2$, $T_{12}$) and a clear objective: derive the branching matrix and then find the critical interlayer transmissibility $T_{12}^{c}$. The conditions under which the solution is sought are explicitly stated.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, unambiguous scientific language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It represents a standard, non-trivial problem in statistical physics and network science. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the multilayer branching matrix and the subsequent calculation of the critical interlayer transmissibility, $T_{12}^{c}$.\n\nThe spreading process can be modeled as a multitype branching process, where the \"individuals\" are infected edges and their \"type\" corresponds to the layer they belong to (layer $1$ or layer $2$). The process evolves in discrete generations, tracking the expected number of newly infected edges. The branching matrix, $\\mathbf{M}$, is a $2 \\times 2$ matrix whose element $M_{ij}$ is the average number of new infections spreading along layer-$j$ edges from a node that was just infected via a layer-$i$ edge.\n\nFirst, we derive the elements of the branching matrix $\\mathbf{M} = \\begin{pmatrix} M_{11}  M_{12} \\\\ M_{21}  M_{22} \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**Diagonal elements ($M_{11}$ and $M_{22}$):**\nThe element $M_{11}$ represents the expected number of secondary infections in layer $1$ originating from a node just infected via a layer-$1$ edge. When we trace an infection along a random edge in the configuration model, the node we arrive at does not have the original degree distribution. Its degree distribution is proportional to $k P(k)$, where $P(k)$ is the original degree distribution. The number of other edges connected to this node is its excess degree, $k-1$.\n\nFor a Poisson degree distribution $P(k) = \\exp(-z) z^k / k!$, the mean degree is $\\langle k \\rangle = z$. The excess degree distribution is given by $P_{ex}(k') = \\frac{(k'+1)P(k'+1)}{\\langle k \\rangle} = \\frac{(k'+1) \\exp(-z) z^{k'+1}}{(k'+1)! z} = \\frac{\\exp(-z) z^{k'}}{k'!}$. This is also a Poisson distribution with the same mean $z$.\n\nSo, if we arrive at a node via a layer-$1$ edge, its number of other layer-$1$ edges follows a Poisson distribution with mean $z_{1}$. Each of these edges transmits the infection independently with probability $T_1$. The expected number of new infections in layer 1 is the mean of the excess degree distribution multiplied by the transmission probability:\n$$\nM_{11} = z_{1} T_{1}\n$$\nBy symmetry, for an infection arriving via a layer-$2$ edge, the expected number of new infections within layer 2 is:\n$$\nM_{22} = z_{2} T_{2}\n$$\n\n**Off-diagonal elements ($M_{12}$ and $M_{21}$):**\nThe element $M_{12}$ is the expected number of secondary infections in layer $2$, given the primary infection arrived via a layer-$1$ edge. Because the layer degrees are independent, arriving at a node via a layer-$1$ edge provides no information about its degree in layer $2$. Therefore, the degree of this node in layer $2$, say $k_2$, follows the original layer-$2$ degree distribution, which is Poisson with mean $z_2$.\n\nThe problem states that a layer switch followed by transmission occurs with probability $T_{12}$. This is the probability for each of the $k_2$ edges in layer $2$ to cause a new infection. The expected number of new infections in layer $2$ is the mean degree in layer $2$ multiplied by this transmission probability:\n$$\nM_{12} = \\langle k_2 \\rangle T_{12} = z_{2} T_{12}\n$$\nSymmetrically, for $M_{21}$, we consider an infection arriving via a layer-$2$ edge. The degree of the reached node in layer $1$, $k_1$, follows the original layer-$1$ distribution with mean $z_1$. The expected number of new infections in layer $1$ is:\n$$\nM_{21} = \\langle k_1 \\rangle T_{12} = z_{1} T_{12}\n$$\n\nCombining these elements, the multilayer branching matrix is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{M} = \\begin{pmatrix} z_{1} T_{1}  z_{2} T_{12} \\\\ z_{1} T_{12}  z_{2} T_{2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe percolation transition occurs when the largest eigenvalue, $\\lambda_{\\max}$, of $\\mathbf{M}$ is equal to $1$. The eigenvalues $\\lambda$ are found by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(\\mathbf{M} - \\lambda \\mathbf{I}) = 0$:\n$$\n\\det \\begin{pmatrix} z_{1} T_{1} - \\lambda  z_{2} T_{12} \\\\ z_{1} T_{12}  z_{2} T_{2} - \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0\n$$\n$$\n(z_{1} T_{1} - \\lambda)(z_{2} T_{2} - \\lambda) - (z_{1} T_{12})(z_{2} T_{12}) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda^2 - (z_{1} T_{1} + z_{2} T_{2})\\lambda + (z_{1} T_{1})(z_{2} T_{2}) - z_{1} z_{2} T_{12}^2 = 0\n$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $\\lambda$. The solutions are given by the quadratic formula:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{(z_{1} T_{1} + z_{2} T_{2}) \\pm \\sqrt{(z_{1} T_{1} + z_{2} T_{2})^2 - 4(z_{1} T_{1} z_{2} T_{2} - z_{1} z_{2} T_{12}^2)}}{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{z_{1} T_{1} + z_{2} T_{2} \\pm \\sqrt{(z_{1} T_{1} - z_{2} T_{2})^2 + 4 z_{1} z_{2} T_{12}^2}}{2}\n$$\nThe largest eigenvalue, $\\lambda_{\\max}$, corresponds to the positive root:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\max} = \\frac{z_{1} T_{1} + z_{2} T_{2} + \\sqrt{(z_{1} T_{1} - z_{2} T_{2})^2 + 4 z_{1} z_{2} T_{12}^2}}{2}\n$$\nThe critical condition for the emergence of a giant component is $\\lambda_{\\max} = 1$.

Epidemic Threshold and Outbreak Size Formula**\nThe N-intertwined mean-field approximation (NIMFA) for the SIS model on a network described by an adjacency operator $M$ (which can be $A$ or $A^{\\mathrm{sup}}$) describes the evolution of the probability $p_i$ that node $i$ is infected. The system of differential equations is:\n$$\n\\frac{dp_i}{dt} \\;=\\; -\\mu p_i + \\beta (1 - p_i) \\sum_{j} M_{ij} p_j\n$$\nIn vector form, this is $\\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dt} = -\\mu \\vec{p} + \\beta \\text{diag}(\\vec{1}-\\vec{p}) M \\vec{p}$. The disease-free equilibrium (DFE) is at $\\vec{p} = \\vec{0}$. To find the epidemic threshold, we linearize the system around this equilibrium. For small $\\vec{p}$, $\\text{diag}(\\vec{1}-\\vec{p}) \\approx I$, the identity matrix. The linearized system is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dt} \\;\\approx\\; -\\mu I \\vec{p} + \\beta M \\vec{p} \\;=\\; (\\beta M - \\mu I) \\vec{p}\n$$\nThe DFE becomes unstable, leading to an epidemic outbreak, if the largest eigenvalue of the Jacobian matrix $J = \\beta M - \\mu I$ is positive. Let $\\lambda_{\\max}(M)$ be the largest eigenvalue (spectral radius) of $M$. The eigenvalues of $J$ are $\\beta \\lambda_k(M) - \\mu$, where $\\lambda_k(M)$ are the eigenvalues of $M$. The condition for instability is:\n$$\n\\beta \\lambda_{\\max}(M) - \\mu \\;\\; 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{\\beta}{\\mu} \\lambda_{\\max}(M) \\;\\; 1 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\tau \\lambda_{\\max}(M) \\;\\; 1\n$$\nThis is the epidemic threshold condition. The threshold is at $\\tau_c = 1/\\lambda_{\\max}(M)$.\n\nTo find the steady-state outbreak size, we set $\\frac{dp_i}{dt} = 0$:\n$$\n\\mu p_i \\;=\\; \\beta (1 - p_i) \\sum_{j} M_{ij} p_j\n$$\nThe problem asks for a one-dimensional coarse-graining and a homogeneous closure. This implies two approximations:\n1. The infection profile is proportional to the principal eigenvector $v_1$ of $M$: $\\vec{p} \\approx S \\vec{v_1}$.\n2. The term $(1-p_i)$ is replaced by a global average $(1-S_{\\mathrm{pred}})$, where $S_{\\mathrm{pred}}$ is the average fraction of infected nodes.\n\nApplying the second approximation (homogeneous closure) to the steady-state equation gives:\n$$\n\\mu p_i \\;\\approx\\; \\beta (1 - S_{\\mathrm{pred}}) \\sum_{j} M_{ij} p_j\n$$\nIn vector form: $\\mu \\vec{p} \\approx \\beta (1 - S_{\\mathrm{pred}}) M \\vec{p}$. This can be rewritten as an eigenvalue equation:\n$$\nM \\vec{p} \\;\\approx\\; \\frac{\\mu}{\\beta (1 - S_{\\mathrm{pred}})} \\vec{p}\n$$\nFor a non-trivial steady state ($\\vec{p} \\neq \\vec{0}$), the term on the right must be an eigenvalue of $M$. For an outbreak to emerge from the DFE, $\\vec{p}$ must be the principal eigenvector, and thus the scalar must be the largest eigenvalue, $\\lambda_{\\max}(M)$.\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\max}(M) \\;=\\; \\frac{\\mu}{\\beta (1 - S_{\\mathrm{pred}})} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{\\tau (1 - S_{\\mathrm{pred}})}\n$$\nSolving for the predicted outbreak size $S_{\\mathrm{pred}}$:\n$$\n\\tau \\lambda_{\\max}(M) (1 - S_{\\mathrm{pred}}) \\;=\\; 1 \\quad \\implies \\quad 1 - S_{\\mathrm{pred}} \\;=\\; \\frac{1}{\\tau \\lambda_{\\max}(M)} \\quad \\implies \\quad S_{\\mathrm{pred}} \\;=\\; 1 - \\frac{1}{\\tau \\lambda_{\\max}(M)}\n$$\nThis is the required analytic expression for the predicted outbreak size, which we denote $S_{\\mathrm{pred}}(\\tau, \\lambda)$, where $\\lambda = \\lambda_{\\max}(M)$.\n\n**2.2. Eigenvalue Calculations**\nFirst, we find the eigenvalues of the intralayer matrix $A$. The matrix $A$ is the adjacency matrix of a complete graph $K_3$ with self-loops removed. $A = J - I_3$, where $J$ is the $3 \\times 3$ all-ones matrix. The eigenvalues of $J$ are $\\{3, 0, 0\\}$. The eigenvalues of $A$ are thus $\\{3-1, 0-1, 0-1\\} = \\{2, -1, -1\\}$. The largest eigenvalue for the single-layer system is:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\max}(A) \\;=\\; 2\n$$\nNext, we find the eigenvalues of the supra-adjacency matrix $A^{\\mathrm{sup}}$. Let $v$ be an eigenvector of $A$ with eigenvalue $\\lambda_A$. We look for eigenvectors of $A^{\\mathrm{sup}}$ of the form $\\begin{pmatrix} v \\\\ \\alpha v \\end{pmatrix}$.\n$$\nA^{\\mathrm{sup}} \\begin{pmatrix} v \\\\ \\alpha v \\end{pmatrix} \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix} A  \\omega I_3 \\\\ \\omega I_3  A \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} v \\\\ \\alpha v \\end{pmatrix} \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix} Av + \\omega (\\alpha v) \\\\ \\omega v + A(\\alpha v) \\end{pmatrix} \\;=\\; \\begin{pmatrix} (\\lambda_A + \\alpha \\omega)v \\\\ (\\omega + \\alpha \\lambda_A)v \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor this to be an eigenvector with eigenvalue $\\Lambda$, we must have $\\Lambda \\begin{pmatrix} v \\\\ \\alpha v \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\Lambda v \\\\ \\Lambda \\alpha v \\end{pmatrix}$. This gives two equations:\n$$\n\\Lambda \\;=\\; \\lambda_A + \\alpha \\omega\n$$\n$$\n\\Lambda \\alpha \\;=\\; \\omega + \\alpha \\lambda_A \\quad \\implies \\quad \\Lambda \\;=\\; \\frac{\\omega}{\\alpha} + \\lambda_A\n$$\nEquating the expressions for $\\Lambda$ yields $\\alpha \\omega = \\frac{\\omega}{\\alpha}$, which since $\\omega = \\frac{1}{2} \\neq 0$ implies $\\alpha^2 = 1$, so $\\alpha = \\pm 1$.\n- For $\\alpha=1$, the eigenvalues are $\\Lambda_+ = \\lambda_A + \\omega$.\n- For $\\alpha=-1$, the eigenvalues are $\\Lambda_- = \\lambda_A - \\omega$.\nUsing the eigenvalues of $A$, $\\{2, -1, -1\\}$, and $\\omega = \\frac{1}{2}$:\n- From $\\lambda_A = 2$: $\\Lambda = 2 \\pm \\frac{1}{2}$, giving $\\{2.5, 1.5\\}$.\n- From $\\lambda_A = -1$: $\\Lambda = -1 \\pm \\frac{1}{2}$, giving $\\{-0.5, -1.5\\}$. Since $\\lambda_A = -1$ has multiplicity $2$, so do these derived eigenvalues.\nThe set of eigenvalues of $A^{\\mathrm{sup}}$ is $\\{2.5, 1.5, -0.5, -0.5, -1.5, -1.5\\}$. The largest eigenvalue is:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\max}(A^{\\mathrm{sup}}) \\;=\\; 2.5 \\;=\\; \\frac{5}{2}\n$$\n\n**2.3.

This practice delves into the crucial role of local clustering and its non-trivial impact on multiplex spreading dynamics . You will analyze a scenario where infection requires simultaneous transmission across layers, and demonstrate how high clustering in one layer can create a \"bottleneck\" that impedes the global process. This counterintuitive result highlights how local structural properties can override global ones, such as the presence of high-degree hubs, offering a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between layers.",

            "problem": "Consider a two-layer multiplex network with a shared set of nodes. Layer $\\mathcal{L}_{1}$ is a heterogeneous, sparse network whose degree distribution has finite first and second moments, with $\\langle k \\rangle_{1} = 6$ and $\\langle k^{2} \\rangle_{1} = 90$, representing the presence of high-degree hubs. Layer $\\mathcal{L}_{2}$ is low-degree and highly clustered: assume every node has degree $2$ so that $\\langle k \\rangle_{2} = 2$ and $\\langle k^{2} \\rangle_{2} = 4$, and suppose its average clustering coefficient is either $C_{2}=0$ (tree-like, no triangles) or $C_{2}=0.9$ (strong triadic closure).\n\nA spreading process unfolds under a Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) dynamics with infection rate $\\beta$ along each intralayer edge and recovery rate $\\mu$. The process is multiplex-AND coupled: a susceptible node becomes infected only if it receives at least one successful transmission in each layer (one in $\\mathcal{L}_{1}$ and one in $\\mathcal{L}_{2}$) within the linearized early-time regime where events can be treated as independent and the spread is well approximated by a branching process on each layer.\n\nUsing first-principles branching-process reasoning appropriate for sparse networks, and incorporating standard corrections that account for how clustering reduces the number of non-redundant forward contacts in the low-degree layer, construct a counterexample showing that the global epidemic threshold of the multiplex increases when $\\mathcal{L}_{2}$ is highly clustered, despite the high-degree hubs in $\\mathcal{L}_{1}$. Quantify this by calculating the ratio\n$$\nr \\equiv \\frac{\\beta_{c}(C_{2}=0.9)}{\\beta_{c}(C_{2}=0)} \\, ,\n$$\nwhere $\\beta_{c}$ is the critical infection rate for the onset of sustained spread under the multiplex-AND SIS dynamics. Treat $\\mu$ as a positive constant (it will cancel in the ratio). Round your final answer for $r$ to four significant figures. Express your answer as a pure number with no units.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the ratio of epidemic thresholds for a Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) process on a two-layer multiplex network under two different clustering scenarios for one of the layers. The spreading dynamics are governed by a multiplex-AND condition, meaning infection requires simultaneous transmission pressure from both layers.\n\nThe epidemic threshold, $\\beta_c$, is the critical value of the infection rate $\\beta$ above which a disease can become endemic in a population. In the context of a branching process approximation, which is valid in the early stages of an outbreak where the density of infected individuals is low, the threshold is determined by the condition that the effective reproduction number of the process equals one. For the specified multiplex-AND SIS dynamics, a standard theoretical framework posits that the threshold condition arises from the interplay of the spreading potential within each layer.\n\nLet $B_1$ and $B_2$ be the branching ratios for layer $\\mathcal{L}_1$ and $\\mathcal{L}_2$, respectively. The branching ratio represents the average number of new infection lineages initiated by a single infected node along a transmission path, assuming the network is locally tree-like. For a network with degree distribution $P(k)$, the branching ratio is given by the formula:\n$$\nB = \\frac{\\langle k^2 \\rangle - \\langle k \\rangle}{\\langle k \\rangle}\n$$\nThis quantity represents the average excess degree of a node reached by following a random edge. The transmissibility of the disease on a single layer $\\alpha$ is proportional to the product of the infection probability per unit time, $\\beta/\\mu$, and the branching ratio $B_\\alpha$. For the multiplex-AND process, the onset of an epidemic is contingent on the spreading processes in both layers being sufficiently strong. A common approximation for the threshold condition in uncorrelated multiplex networks is that the product of the individual layer 'super-transmissibilities' equals one. This leads to the condition:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\beta_c}{\\mu} \\right)^2 B_1^{\\text{eff}} B_2^{\\text{eff}} = 1\n$$\nwhere $B_\\alpha^{\\text{eff}}$ is the effective branching ratio for layer $\\alpha$. This allows us to express the critical infection rate $\\beta_c$ as:\n$$\n\\beta_c = \\mu \\left( B_1^{\\text{eff}} B_2^{\\text{eff}} \\right)^{-1/2}\n$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the effective branching ratio for layer $\\mathcal{L}_1$. The problem states that $\\mathcal{L}_1$ is a sparse, heterogeneous network, for which the tree-like approximation is appropriate. No clustering correction is mentioned for this layer.\nGiven $\\langle k \\rangle_1 = 6$ and $\\langle k^2 \\rangle_1 = 90$, the branching ratio $B_1$ is:\n$$\nB_1^{\\text{eff}} = B_1 = \\frac{\\langle k^2 \\rangle_1 - \\langle k \\rangle_1}{\\langle k \\rangle_1} = \\frac{90 - 6}{6} = \\frac{84}{6} = 14\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the effective branching ratio for layer $\\mathcal{L}_2$. Layer $\\mathcal{L}_2$ is a $2$-regular graph, as every node has degree $k=2$. For this layer, we have $\\langle k \\rangle_2 = 2$ and $\\langle k^2 \\rangle_2 = 2^2 = 4$.\nThe uncorrected branching ratio for $\\mathcal{L}_2$ would be:\n$$\nB_2 = \\frac{\\langle k^2 \\rangle_2 - \\langle k \\rangle_2}{\\langle k \\rangle_2} = \\frac{4 - 2}{2} = 1\n$$\nThis result is intuitive: in a $2$-regular graph (which is a collection of disjoint cycles or an infinite line), arriving at a node from one edge leaves exactly one other edge (the excess degree is $k-1=1$) for the process to continue forward.\n\nHowever, the problem specifies that we must incorporate a correction for clustering in $\\mathcal{L}_2$. The average clustering coefficient $C_2$ quantifies the prevalence of triangles in the network. For a node in a $2$-regular graph, its local clustering coefficient is $1$ if its two neighbors are connected (forming a triangle) and $0$ otherwise. The average clustering coefficient $C_2$ is therefore the probability that for a randomly chosen node, its two neighbors are connected.\n\nIn a branching process, we follow a path of infection from one node to the next. Let's say the process moves from node $j$ to node $i$. Node $i$ has one other neighbor, $l$. The process would then continue to $l$. If nodes $j, i, l$ form a triangle, the path $j \\to i \\to l$ leads to a node $l$ that is already a neighbor of $j$. From the perspective of spreading originating from $j$'s neighborhood, this is a redundant path that does not explore new parts of the network and thus hinders the spread. The probability of such a redundant step is equal to the clustering coefficient $C_2$. Consequently, the probability of taking a non-redundant step to a truly \"new\" node is $1 - C_2$. The effective branching ratio is the uncorrected ratio multiplied by this probability factor:\n$$\nB_2^{\\text{eff}} = B_2 (1 - C_2) = 1 \\cdot (1 - C_2) = 1 - C_2\n$$\n\nNow we can calculate the critical threshold $\\beta_c$ for the two scenarios.\n\nCase 1: Tree-like $\\mathcal{L}_2$ with $C_2 = 0$.\nThe effective branching ratio for $\\mathcal{L}_2$ is $B_2^{\\text{eff}}(C_2=0) = 1 - 0 = 1$. The critical threshold is:\n$$\n\\beta_c(C_2=0) = \\mu \\left( B_1 \\cdot B_2^{\\text{eff}}(C_2=0) \\right)^{-1/2} = \\mu (14 \\cdot 1)^{-1/2} = \\frac{\\mu}{\\sqrt{14}}\n$$\n\nCase 2: Highly clustered $\\mathcal{L}_2$ with $C_2 = 0.9$.\nThe effective branching ratio for $\\mathcal{L}_2$ is $B_2^{\\text{eff}}(C_2=0.9) = 1 - 0.9 = 0.1$. The critical threshold is:\n$$\n\\beta_c(C_2=0.9) = \\mu \\left( B_1 \\cdot B_2^{\\text{eff}}(C_2=0.9) \\right)^{-1/2} = \\mu (14 \\cdot 0.1)^{-1/2} = \\frac{\\mu}{\\sqrt{1.4}}\n$$\nAs required by the problem's framing, we observe that $\\beta_c(C_2=0.9)  \\beta_c(C_2=0)$, demonstrating that high clustering in the low-degree layer increases the epidemic threshold, making the spread more difficult. This is because the clustering creates local traps that inhibit the expansion of the infection process on layer $\\mathcal{L}_2$, and since the global process requires success on both layers, this bottleneck in $\\mathcal{L}_2$ dominates.\n\nFinally, we calculate the required ratio $r$:\n$$\nr = \\frac{\\beta_c(C_2=0.9)}{\\beta_c(C_2=0)} = \\frac{\\mu / \\sqrt{1.4}}{\\mu / \\sqrt{14}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{14}}{\\sqrt{1.4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{14}{1.4}} = \\sqrt{10}\n$$\nThe problem requires a numerical answer rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nr = \\sqrt{10} \\approx 3.16227766...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $r \\approx 3.162$.",
