The theorem's power lies in decomposing the problem into two intuitive conditions: ensuring every state is reachable by an input, and ensuring the network has no \"bottlenecks\" known as dilations. This first exercise  provides a direct, hands-on test of your ability to identify these two fundamental properties on a simple three-node network, forming the essential first step in applying the full theorem.",

            "solution": "The problem asks us to analyze a given Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) structured system for two properties related to structural controllability, based on the graph-theoretic conditions of Lin’s theorem.\n\nThe system is defined by a system digraph. Let $V_x = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ be the set of state nodes and $V_u = \\{u\\}$ be the set of input nodes. The total set of vertices in the digraph is $V = V_x \\cup V_u = \\{u, 1, 2, 3\\}$. The directed edges are given as $E = \\{(u, 1), (1, 3), (2, 3)\\}$. This corresponds to a system where input $u$ affects state $1$, state $1$ affects state $3$, and state $2$ affects state $3$.\n\nWe will address the two parts of the problem sequentially.\n\n**1. Accessibility of State Node $2$**\n\nA state node is accessible if there exists a directed path from an input node to that state node in the system digraph. In this system, the only input node is $u$. Therefore, we must determine if there is a directed path from node $u$ to node $2$.\n\nA directed path is a sequence of vertices $(v_0, v_1, \\dots, v_k)$ such that for each $i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, k-1\\}$, the directed edge $(v_i, v_{i+1})$ exists in the graph's edge set $E$. For node $2$ to be accessible, there must be a path with $v_0 = u$ and $v_k = 2$.\n\nLet's examine the structure of the digraph. The edges are $u \\to 1$, $1 \\to 3$, and $2 \\to 3$. The only node that can be reached from the input $u$ is node $1$, via the direct edge $(u, 1)$. From node $1$, we can only reach node $3$ via the edge $(1, 3)$. Thus, the only state nodes reachable from the input $u$ are $1$ and $3$, via the paths $(u, 1)$ and $(u, 1, 3)$, respectively.\n\nNode $2$ has no incoming edges from any other node in the graph; its in-degree is $0$. Therefore, it is impossible for any directed path to terminate at node $2$. Consequently, there is no directed path from the input node $u$ to the state node $2$.\n\nThus, the state node $2$ is not accessible. According to the problem's convention, the first entry of the result matrix is $0$.\n\n**2. Existence of a Dilation**\n\nA dilation is a structural property that obstructs controllability. A dilation exists if there is a non-empty subset of state nodes, $S \\subseteq V_x$, such that the cardinality of its set of in-neighbors, $\\mathcal{N}^{-}(S)$, is strictly less than the cardinality of $S$ itself, i.e., $|\\mathcal{N}^{-}(S)|  |S|$. The set $\\mathcal{N}^{-}(S)$ consists of all nodes (both state and input) that have an edge pointing to at least one node in $S$. We must check all non-empty subsets of the state set $V_x = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ for this condition.\n\n-   Consider the subset $S_1 = \\{1\\}$. The only edge entering $S_1$ is $(u, 1)$. The source node is $u$. Thus, $\\mathcal{N}^{-}(S_1) = \\{u\\}$. We compare the cardinalities: $|\\mathcal{N}^{-}(S_1)| = 1$ and $|S_1| = 1$. The condition $|\\mathcal{N}^{-}(S_1)|  |S_1|$, or $1  1$, is false.\n\n-   Consider the subset $S_2 = \\{2\\}$. There are no edges in the digraph that terminate at node $2$. Therefore, the set of in-neighbors is empty: $\\mathcal{N}^{-}(S_2) = \\emptyset$. We compare the cardinalities: $|\\mathcal{N}^{-}(S_2)| = 0$ and $|S_2| = 1$. The condition $|\\mathcal{N}^{-}(S_2)|  |S_2|$, or $0  1$, is true.\n\nSince we have found a subset $S = \\{2\\}$ for which the condition holds, we can conclude that a dilation exists in the system. The existence of even one such set is sufficient.\n\nFor the sake of completeness, we can check the other subsets:\n-   $S_3 = \\{3\\}$: The in-neighbors are the sources of edges $(1,3)$ and $(2,3)$, so $\\mathcal{N}^{-}(S_3)=\\{1, 2\\}$. $|\\mathcal{N}^{-}(S_3)|=2$, $|S_3|=1$. The condition $2  1$ is false.\n-   $S_4 = \\{1, 2\\}$: The only in-neighbor is $u$ (source of edge $(u,1)$). $\\mathcal{N}^{-}(S_4)=\\{u\\}$. $|\\mathcal{N}^{-}(S_4)|=1$, $|S_4|=2$. The condition $1  2$ is true. This is also a dilation.\n-   $S_5 = \\{1, 3\\}$: The in-neighbors are $u$ (source for $S_1$) and $\\{1, 2\\}$ (sources for $S_3$). The union is $\\mathcal{N}^{-}(S_5)=\\{u, 1, 2\\}$. $|\\mathcal{N}^{-}(S_5)|=3$, $|S_5|=2$. The condition $3  2$ is false.\n-   $S_6 = \\{2, 3\\}$: The in-neighbors are $\\{1, 2\\}$. $\\mathcal{N}^{-}(S_6)=\\{1, 2\\}$. $|\\mathcal{N}^{-}(S_6)|=2$, $|S_6|=2$. The condition $2  2$ is false.\n-   $S_7 = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$: The in-neighbors are $\\{u, 1, 2\\}$. $\\mathcal{N}^{-}(S_7)=\\{u, 1, 2\\}$. $|\\mathcal{N}^{-}(S_7)|=3$, $|S_7|=3$. The condition $3  3$ is false.\n\nThe dilations are the subsets $\\{2\\}$ and $\\{1,2\\}$. Since at least one dilation exists, the second entry of the result matrix is $1$.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n-   Node $2$ is not accessible, so the first entry is $0$.\n-   A dilation exists (e.g., the set $S = \\{2\\}$), so the second entry is $1$.\n\nThe final result is to be reported as a row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} 0  1 \\end{pmatrix}$.",

            "solution": "The analysis of structural controllability for a system pair $(A, B)$ can be performed through two primary, equivalent methods: an algebraic approach based on the rank of the controllability matrix and a graph-theoretic approach based on the structure of the network defined by $A$ and $B$.\n\n**1. Determination of Structural Controllability and the Controllability Index $\\mu$**\n\nA structured LTI system is structurally controllable if and only if the controllability matrix $\\mathcal{C} = [B, AB, A^2B, \\dots, A^{N-1}B]$ has a generic rank equal to the dimension of the state space, $N$. Here, $N=4$. The generic rank is the rank of the matrix for almost all numerical instantiations of its free parameters. This is equivalent to checking if the determinant of at least one $N \\times N$ submatrix of $\\mathcal{C}$ is a non-zero polynomial in the free parameters.\n\nLet us construct the controllability matrix $\\mathcal{C} = [B, AB, A^2B, A^3B]$.\nThe matrices are:\n$A = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  0  0 \\\\ a_{21}  0  0  0 \\\\ 0  a_{32}  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  a_{43}  0 \\end{pmatrix}$, $B = \\begin{pmatrix} b_{1} \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}$\n\nWe compute the columns of $\\mathcal{C}$:\nThe first column is $B$ itself:\n$$ B = \\begin{pmatrix} b_{1} \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe second column is $AB$:\n$$ AB = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  0  0 \\\\ a_{21}  0  0  0 \\\\ 0  a_{32}  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  a_{43}  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} b_{1} \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ a_{21}b_{1} \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe third column is $A^2B = A(AB)$:\n$$ A^2B = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  0  0 \\\\ a_{21}  0  0  0 \\\\ 0  a_{32}  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  a_{43}  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ a_{21}b_{1} \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ a_{32}a_{21}b_{1} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe fourth column is $A^3B = A(A^2B)$:\n$$ A^3B = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  0  0 \\\\ a_{21}  0  0  0 \\\\ 0  a_{32}  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  a_{43}  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ a_{32}a_{21}b_{1} \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ a_{43}a_{32}a_{21}b_{1} \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThe full controllability matrix is:\n$$ \\mathcal{C} = [B, AB, A^2B, A^3B] = \\begin{pmatrix}\nb_1  0  0  0 \\\\\n0  a_{21}b_1  0  0 \\\\\n0  0  a_{32}a_{21}b_1  0 \\\\\n0  0  0  a_{43}a_{32}a_{21}b_1\n\\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe determinant of this matrix is the product of its diagonal entries:\n$$ \\det(\\mathcal{C}) = (b_1) \\cdot (a_{21}b_1) \\cdot (a_{32}a_{21}b_1) \\cdot (a_{43}a_{32}a_{21}b_1) = a_{21}^3 a_{32}^2 a_{43} b_1^4 $$\nSince $a_{21}, a_{32}, a_{43}, b_{1}$ are independent free parameters, their product is a non-zero polynomial. For any generic (non-zero) choice of these parameters, $\\det(\\mathcal{C}) \\neq 0$. Therefore, the generic rank of $\\mathcal{C}$ is $4$.\nAs the generic rank of the controllability matrix is equal to the state-space dimension $N=4$, the system is **structurally controllable** with the single input at node $1$.\n\nNext, we compute the structural controllability index $\\mu$. This is the smallest integer $\\mu$ for which the generic rank of $\\mathcal{C}_{\\mu} = [B, AB, \\dots, A^{\\mu-1}B]$ is $4$.\n- For $\\mu=1$, $\\mathcal{C}_1 = [B]$ has generic rank $1$.\n- For $\\mu=2$, $\\mathcal{C}_2 = [B, AB]$ has generic rank $2$, as its top-left $2 \\times 2$ determinant is $a_{21}b_1^2 \\not\\equiv 0$.\n- For $\\mu=3$, $\\mathcal{C}_3 = [B, AB, A^2B]$ has generic rank $3$, as its top-left $3 \\times 3$ determinant is $a_{21}^2 a_{32} b_1^3 \\not\\equiv 0$.\n- For $\\mu=4$, $\\mathcal{C}_4 = [B, AB, A^2B, A^3B]$ has generic rank $4$.\nThe rank first becomes $4$ for $\\mu=4$. Thus, the structural controllability index is $\\mu=4$.\n\n**2. Determination of the Minimal Number of Inputs $m$**\n\nThe minimal number of inputs $m$ needed to make a network structurally controllable is determined by the topology of the directed graph $G(A)$ associated with the state matrix $A$. The formula is $m = \\max(1, N - |M^*|)$, where $|M^*|$ is the size of the maximum matching in $G(A)$.\n\nThe matrix $A$ has non-zero entries $a_{21}, a_{32}, a_{43}$. An entry $A_{ij}$ corresponds to a directed edge from node $j$ to node $i$.\n- $a_{21} \\neq 0 \\implies$ edge $1 \\to 2$\n- $a_{32} \\neq 0 \\implies$ edge $2 \\to 3$\n- $a_{43} \\neq 0 \\implies$ edge $3 \\to 4$\nThe graph $G(A)$ is a directed chain: $1 \\to 2 \\to 3 \\to 4$.\n\nA matching $M$ in a directed graph is a set of edges such that each vertex has an in-degree of at most one and an out-degree of at most one with respect to the edges in $M$. We seek the matching with the maximum number of edges, $|M^*|$.\nThe set of all edges is $E = \\{(1,2), (2,3), (3,4)\\}$.\nWe can select all three edges for our matching: $M = \\{(1,2), (2,3), (3,4)\\}$. Let's verify if this is a valid matching.\n- Node $1$: in-degree in $M$ is $0$, out-degree is $1$. This is valid.\n- Node $2$: in-degree in $M$ is $1$ (from edge $(1,2)$), out-degree is $1$ (from edge $(2,3)$). This is valid.\n- Node $3$: in-degree in $M$ is $1$ (from edge $(2,3)$), out-degree is $1$ (from edge $(3,4)$). This is valid.\n- Node $4$: in-degree in $M$ is $1$ (from edge $(3,4)$), out-degree is $0$. This is valid.\nSince all vertex degree constraints are satisfied, $M = \\{(1,2), (2,3), (3,4)\\}$ is a valid matching. Its size is $|M|=3$. As it includes all available edges, it is a maximum matching. So, $|M^*|=3$.\n\nThe minimal number of inputs is:\n$$ m = \\max(1, N - |M^*|) = \\max(1, 4-3) = \\max(1,1) = 1 $$\nThis confirms that the network is controllable with a minimum of $m=1$ input. The theory further dictates that the input must be placed on the node(s) that are not matched, i.e., not the target of any edge in the maximum matching. In our matching $M^*$, the target nodes are $\\{2,3,4\\}$. The only unmatched node is node $1$. The given input matrix $B$ places the input at node $1$, which is consistent with the theoretical requirement for achieving controllability with a single input.\n\n**Summary of Results**\n- The minimal number of inputs required for structural controllability is $m=1$.\n- The structural controllability index for the given input configuration is $\\mu=4$.\n\nThe final answer is the row matrix $(m, \\mu)$.",

This identity can be satisfied for non-zero values of all parameters $a, b, c, p, q$. Its satisfaction leads to a loss of controllability due to a precise cancellation of terms, a phenomenon that occurs on an \"algebraic variety of measure zero in parameter space,\" as alluded to in the problem. This is the non-generic realization sought.
