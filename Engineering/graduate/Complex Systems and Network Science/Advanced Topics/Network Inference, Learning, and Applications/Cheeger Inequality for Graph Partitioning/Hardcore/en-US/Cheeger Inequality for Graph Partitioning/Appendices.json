            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of the graph conductance $\\phi(G)$ and the second-smallest eigenvalue $\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L})$ of the normalized Laplacian for the complete graph $K_n$, followed by a verification of the Cheeger inequality using these exact values. The solution proceeds in three parts: first, the calculation of the conductance; second, the calculation of the eigenvalue; and third, the verification of the inequality bounds.\n\n**Part 1: Computation of the Conductance $\\phi(K_n)$**\n\nThe graph $G$ is the complete graph $K_n$ on $n \\geq 2$ vertices. It is an undirected, unweighted, simple graph. In $K_n$, every vertex is connected to every other vertex, so it is a regular graph where every vertex has degree $k = n-1$.\n\nLet $S$ be a proper non-empty subset of the vertex set $V$, with $|S|=s$. The number of vertices in its complement $\\bar{S} = V \\setminus S$ is $|\\bar{S}| = n-s$.\n\nThe volume of the set $S$, $\\operatorname{vol}(S)$, is the sum of the degrees of the vertices in $S$. Since every vertex has degree $n-1$, we have:\n$$ \\operatorname{vol}(S) = \\sum_{v \\in S} \\deg(v) = s(n-1) $$\nThe total volume of the graph is $\\operatorname{vol}(V) = n(n-1)$.\n\nThe cut weight, $w(S, \\bar{S})$, is the number of edges with one endpoint in $S$ and the other in $\\bar{S}$. In a complete graph, every vertex in $S$ is connected to every vertex in $\\bar{S}$. Therefore, the number of edges crossing the cut is:\n$$ w(S, \\bar{S}) = |S| \\cdot |\\bar{S}| = s(n-s) $$\n\nThe conductance of the set $S$, denoted $\\phi(S)$, is defined as the ratio of the cut weight to the volume:\n$$ \\phi(S) = \\frac{w(S, \\bar{S})}{\\operatorname{vol}(S)} = \\frac{s(n-s)}{s(n-1)} = \\frac{n-s}{n-1} $$\n\nThe conductance of the graph, $\\phi(G)$, is defined as the minimum conductance over all sets $S$ such that $0 < \\operatorname{vol}(S) \\leq \\operatorname{vol}(V)/2$:\n$$ \\phi(G) = \\min_{S \\subset V: 0 < \\operatorname{vol}(S) \\leq \\operatorname{vol}(V)/2} \\phi(S) $$\nThe constraint on the volume, $0 < \\operatorname{vol}(S) \\leq \\operatorname{vol}(V)/2$, translates to a constraint on the size $s$ of the set $S$:\n$$ 0 < s(n-1) \\leq \\frac{n(n-1)}{2} $$\nSince $n \\geq 2$, we have $n-1 > 0$, so we can divide by $n-1$ to get:\n$$ 0 < s \\leq \\frac{n}{2} $$\nSince $s$ must be an integer, the possible values for $s$ are $s \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor \\}$.\n\nWe need to find the minimum of $\\phi(S) = \\frac{n-s}{n-1}$ for $s$ in this range. The function $f(s) = \\frac{n-s}{n-1}$ is a linearly decreasing function of $s$. Therefore, its minimum value is achieved when $s$ is maximized. The maximum allowed value for $s$ is $s_{max} = \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$.\n\nSubstituting $s = \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$ into the expression for $\\phi(S)$:\n$$ \\phi(K_n) = \\frac{n - \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor}{n-1} $$\nThis expression can be simplified by noting that $n - \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor = \\lceil n/2 \\rceil$. Thus, the conductance of $K_n$ is:\n$$ \\phi(K_n) = \\frac{\\lceil n/2 \\rceil}{n-1} $$\n\n**Part 2: Computation of the Eigenvalue $\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L}(K_n))$**\n\nThe normalized Laplacian is defined as $\\mathcal{L} = I - D^{-1/2} A D^{-1/2}$. For a $k$-regular graph, the degree matrix is $D = kI$, where $I$ is the identity matrix. Thus, $D^{-1/2} = (1/\\sqrt{k})I$. For $K_n$, the degree is $k=n-1$. The normalized Laplacian simplifies to:\n$$ \\mathcal{L} = I - \\frac{1}{n-1}A $$\nwhere $A$ is the adjacency matrix of $K_n$.\n\nThe eigenvalues of $\\mathcal{L}$ are related to the eigenvalues of $A$. Let $\\mu$ be an eigenvalue of $A$ with corresponding eigenvector $\\mathbf{v}$. Then:\n$$ \\mathcal{L}\\mathbf{v} = \\left(I - \\frac{1}{n-1}A\\right)\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{v} - \\frac{1}{n-1}(A\\mathbf{v}) = \\mathbf{v} - \\frac{1}{n-1}(\\mu\\mathbf{v}) = \\left(1 - \\frac{\\mu}{n-1}\\right)\\mathbf{v} $$\nSo, if $\\mu$ is an eigenvalue of $A$, then $\\lambda = 1 - \\frac{\\mu}{n-1}$ is an eigenvalue of $\\mathcal{L}$.\n\nThe adjacency matrix of $K_n$ is $A = J - I$, where $J$ is the $n \\times n$ all-ones matrix. The eigenvalues of $J$ are $n$ (with multiplicity $1$ and eigenvector $\\mathbf{1}$, the all-ones vector) and $0$ (with multiplicity $n-1$, corresponding to the eigenspace of vectors orthogonal to $\\mathbf{1}$).\nThe eigenvalues of $A=J-I$ are therefore:\n- $\\mu_1 = n-1$ (with multiplicity $1$)\n- $\\mu_2, \\dots, \\mu_n = 0-1 = -1$ (with multiplicity $n-1$)\n\nNow, we can find the eigenvalues of $\\mathcal{L}$:\n- For $\\mu_1 = n-1$: $\\lambda_1 = 1 - \\frac{n-1}{n-1} = 0$. This is the smallest eigenvalue, as expected for any connected graph.\n- For $\\mu_i = -1$ (for $i=2, \\dots, n$): $\\lambda_i = 1 - \\frac{-1}{n-1} = 1 + \\frac{1}{n-1} = \\frac{n-1+1}{n-1} = \\frac{n}{n-1}$.\n\nThe eigenvalues of $\\mathcal{L}$ are $0$ (with multiplicity $1$) and $\\frac{n}{n-1}$ (with multiplicity $n-1$). The eigenvalues in non-decreasing order are $\\lambda_1(\\mathcal{L}) = 0$ and $\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L}) = \\dots = \\lambda_n(\\mathcal{L}) = \\frac{n}{n-1}$.\nThe second-smallest eigenvalue is therefore:\n$$ \\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L}(K_n)) = \\frac{n}{n-1} $$\n\n**Part 3: Verification of the Cheeger Inequality**\n\nThe Cheeger inequality for the normalized Laplacian states that for any graph $G$:\n$$ \\frac{\\phi(G)^2}{2} \\leq \\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L}) \\leq 2 \\phi(G) $$\nWe verify these two bounds for $K_n$ using our exact values:\n$\\phi(K_n) = \\frac{\\lceil n/2 \\rceil}{n-1}$ and $\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L}(K_n)) = \\frac{n}{n-1}$.\n\n**Upper Bound Verification: $\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L}) \\leq 2 \\phi(G)$**\n$$ \\frac{n}{n-1} \\leq 2 \\frac{\\lceil n/2 \\rceil}{n-1} $$\nSince $n-1 > 0$, we can multiply both sides by $n-1$:\n$$ n \\leq 2 \\lceil n/2 \\rceil $$\nWe examine this for even and odd $n$:\n- If $n$ is even, let $n=2k$ for some integer $k \\geq 1$. Then $\\lceil n/2 \\rceil = \\lceil k \\rceil = k = n/2$. The inequality becomes $2k \\leq 2(k)$, which simplifies to $2k \\leq 2k$. This is an equality.\n- If $n$ is odd, let $n=2k+1$ for some integer $k \\geq 1$. Then $\\lceil n/2 \\rceil = \\lceil k+1/2 \\rceil = k+1 = (n+1)/2$. The inequality becomes $2k+1 \\leq 2(k+1)$, which simplifies to $2k+1 \\leq 2k+2$. This is a strict inequality.\n\nThus, the upper bound holds for all $n \\geq 2$, and equality is achieved if and only if $n$ is even. This demonstrates that the constant $2$ in the upper bound is tight.\n\n**Lower Bound Verification: $\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L}) \\geq \\phi(G)^2 / 2$**\n$$ \\frac{n}{n-1} \\geq \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\lceil n/2 \\rceil}{n-1} \\right)^2 $$\n$$ \\frac{n}{n-1} \\geq \\frac{(\\lceil n/2 \\rceil)^2}{2(n-1)^2} $$\nMultiplying by $2(n-1)^2$ (which is positive) gives:\n$$ 2n(n-1) \\geq (\\lceil n/2 \\rceil)^2 $$\nWe examine this for even and odd $n$:\n- If $n$ is even, $n=2k$, so $\\lceil n/2 \\rceil = k$. The inequality is $2(2k)(2k-1) \\geq k^2$. Since $k \\geq 1$, we can divide by $k$: $4(2k-1) \\geq k \\implies 8k-4 \\geq k \\implies 7k \\geq 4$. This is true for all $k \\geq 1$ (i.e., $n \\geq 2$). Equality would require $7k=4$, which is not possible for integer $k$.\n- If $n$ is odd, $n=2k+1$, so $\\lceil n/2 \\rceil = k+1$. The inequality is $2(2k+1)(2k) \\geq (k+1)^2 \\implies 8k^2+4k \\geq k^2+2k+1 \\implies 7k^2+2k-1 \\geq 0$. For $k \\geq 1$, this quadratic is always positive. The roots are $\\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{4 - 4(7)(-1)}}{14} = \\frac{-2 \\pm \\sqrt{32}}{14}$, so the positive root is less than $1$. As $k \\geq 1$, the inequality is strictly satisfied.\n\nThe lower bound holds for all $n \\geq 2$, and equality is never achieved for the family of complete graphs. This implies that for this specific class of graphs, the lower bound $\\lambda_2 \\geq \\phi^2/2$ is not tight.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated as valid. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of spectral graph theory, well-posed with a clear and consistent set of definitions and constraints, and formulated objectively. All terms, such as the symmetric normalized Laplacian, conductance, and the Rayleigh quotient, are standard in the field of network science. The graph construction is a well-known example (a dumbbell graph), and the task is a standard application of these theoretical concepts.\n\nWe proceed with the solution, which is divided into two parts: first, the computation of the exact graph conductance $\\phi(G)$, and second, the estimation of the second-smallest eigenvalue $\\lambda_{2}(\\mathcal{L})$ using the specified test function.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of the Graph Conductance $\\phi(G)$**\n\nThe graph $G$ is composed of two disjoint cliques, each a $K_m$, which we will denote as $V_1$ and $V_2$. Each clique has $m$ vertices. Let $v_b \\in V_1$ and $u_b \\in V_2$ be the designated bridge vertices. A single edge connects $v_b$ and $u_b$. The total number of vertices in the graph is $|V| = 2m$.\n\nFirst, we determine the degrees of the vertices.\n- For any non-bridge vertex $v \\in V_1 \\setminus \\{v_b\\}$, it is connected to the other $m-1$ vertices within its clique $K_m$. Thus, its degree is $d_v = m-1$. There are $m-1$ such vertices in $V_1$.\n- The bridge vertex $v_b \\in V_1$ is connected to the $m-1$ other vertices in $V_1$ and to the bridge vertex $u_b$ in $V_2$. Thus, its degree is $d_{v_b} = (m-1) + 1 = m$.\n- By symmetry, the degrees of the vertices in $V_2$ are identical: $d_u = m-1$ for non-bridge vertices $u \\in V_2 \\setminus \\{u_b\\}$ and $d_{u_b} = m$ for the bridge vertex.\n\nNext, we compute the volume of a set of vertices $S$, defined as $\\mathrm{vol}(S) = \\sum_{i \\in S} d_i$.\n- The volume of the first clique $V_1$ is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{vol}(V_1) = \\sum_{v \\in V_1} d_v = (m-1)(m-1) + 1(m) = m^2 - 2m + 1 + m = m^2 - m + 1\n$$\n- By symmetry, the volume of the second clique $V_2$ is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{vol}(V_2) = m^2 - m + 1\n$$\n- The total volume of the graph is $\\mathrm{vol}(G) = \\mathrm{vol}(V_1) + \\mathrm{vol}(V_2) = 2(m^2 - m + 1)$.\n\nThe graph conductance is $\\phi(G) = \\min_{S \\subset V} \\phi(S)$, where $\\phi(S) = \\frac{w(S, \\bar{S})}{\\min(\\mathrm{vol}(S), \\mathrm{vol}(\\bar{S}))}$.\nThe structure of the graph, with two dense clusters connected by a single edge, suggests that the minimum conductance cut will separate the two cliques. Let's consider the partition where $S = V_1$ and its complement is $\\bar{S} = V_2$.\n- The cut weight, $w(V_1, V_2)$, is the number of edges between $V_1$ and $V_2$. There is only the single bridge edge, so $w(V_1, V_2) = 1$.\n- The volumes are $\\mathrm{vol}(V_1) = m^2 - m + 1$ and $\\mathrm{vol}(V_2) = m^2 - m + 1$.\n- Therefore, $\\min(\\mathrm{vol}(V_1), \\mathrm{vol}(V_2)) = m^2 - m + 1$.\n- The conductance of this partition is:\n$$\n\\phi(V_1) = \\frac{1}{m^2 - m + 1}\n$$\nThis partition represents the natural bottleneck of the graph. Any other cut that, for example, separates a single vertex from the rest, would result in a higher conductance value. For dumbbell graphs of this type, it is a standard result that this partition provides the minimum conductance. Thus, the graph conductance is:\n$$\n\\phi(G) = \\frac{1}{m^2 - m + 1}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Approximation of $\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L})$**\n\nWe need to compute an approximation for $\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L})$ using the Rayleigh quotient $\\mathcal{R}(f)$ of a specifically constructed test function $f$.\nThe test function $f$ must be:\n1.

Orthogonal to the trivial eigenvector $D^{1/2}\\mathbf{1}$, which means $\\sum_{i \\in V} f_i \\sqrt{d_i} = 0$.\n\nLet's apply the orthogonality constraint to our piecewise function:\n$$\n\\sum_{i \\in V} f_i \\sqrt{d_i} = \\sum_{i \\in V_1} (c_1 \\sqrt{d_i})\\sqrt{d_i} + \\sum_{i \\in V_2} (c_2 \\sqrt{d_i})\\sqrt{d_i} = 0\n$$\n$$\nc_1 \\sum_{i \\in V_1} d_i + c_2 \\sum_{i \\in V_2} d_i = 0\n$$\n$$\nc_1 \\, \\mathrm{vol}(V_1) + c_2 \\, \\mathrm{vol}(V_2) = 0\n$$\nSince $\\mathrm{vol}(V_1) = \\mathrm{vol}(V_2) = m^2 - m + 1$, this simplifies to $c_1(m^2 - m + 1) + c_2(m^2 - m + 1) = 0$, which implies $c_1 + c_2 = 0$, or $c_2 = -c_1$.

In a cycle graph, this means selecting a contiguous block of vertices. Let $S_k = \\{v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_k\\}$ be a set of $k$ consecutive vertices. The edges within this block are $(v_i, v_{i+1})$ for $i=1, \\ldots, k-1$. The edges connecting $S_k$ to its complement $V \\setminus S_k$ are the edge between $v_k$ and $v_{k+1}$ and the edge between $v_1$ and $v_n$. Thus, for any such contiguous block $S_k$ (where $1 \\le k \\le n-1$), the cut weight is $w(S_k, V \\setminus S_k) = 2$.\nAny other choice of $S$ with $|S|=k$ which is not a single contiguous block can be seen as a union of at least two disjoint contiguous blocks. Each such block would contribute at least $2$ edges to the cut (unless a block is of size $n-1$), so $w(S, V \\setminus S)$ would be greater than or equal to $4$. Therefore, the minimum value of $w(S, V \\setminus S)$ for any fixed $k$ is $2$, achieved by taking a contiguous block of vertices.\n\nThe problem of computing the conductance reduces to minimizing the following expression over $k \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, n-1\\}$:\n$$\n\\frac{2}{2\\min\\{k, n-k\\}} = \\frac{1}{\\min\\{k, n-k\\}}\n$$\nTo minimize this fraction, we must maximize the denominator $\\min\\{k, n-k\\}$. The function $f(k) = \\min\\{k, n-k\\}$ increases for $k \\le n/2$ and decreases for $k > n/2$. Its maximum value is achieved when $k$ is as close to $n/2$ as possible, i.e., at $k = \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$ or $k = \\lceil n/2 \\rceil$. The maximum value of $\\min\\{k, n-k\\}$ is $\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$.\n\nTherefore, the conductance of $C_n$ is:\n$$\n\\phi(C_n) = \\frac{1}{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor}\n$$\n\n**2. Calculation of the Second Smallest Eigenvalue $\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L})$**\n\nThe normalized Laplacian is $\\mathcal{L} = I - D^{-1/2} A D^{-1/2}$. For the $2$-regular graph $C_n$, the degree matrix is $D=2I$. Thus, $D^{-1/2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}I$.\nThe Laplacian simplifies to $\\mathcal{L} = I - (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}I) A (\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}I) = I - \\frac{1}{2}A$.\nThe eigenvalues of $\\mathcal{L}$, which we denote by $\\lambda_j(\\mathcal{L})$, are related to the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix $A$, which we denote by $\\mu_j(A)$, by the relation $\\lambda_j(\\mathcal{L}) = 1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_j(A)$.\n\nThe adjacency matrix of $C_n$ is a circulant matrix whose first row is $(0, 1, 0, \\ldots, 0, 1)$. The eigenvalues of such a matrix are given by the formula $\\mu_j(A) = 2\\cos(2\\pi j/n)$ for $j=0, 1, \\ldots, n-1$.\nThe eigenvalues of the normalized Laplacian $\\mathcal{L}$ are therefore:\n$$\n\\lambda_j(\\mathcal{L}) = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 2\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi j}{n}\\right) \\right) = 1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi j}{n}\\right) \\quad \\text{for } j=0, 1, \\ldots, n-1\n$$\nWe need to find the second smallest of these eigenvalues. The eigenvalues are sorted in non-decreasing order: $\\lambda_1(\\mathcal{L}) \\le \\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L}) \\le \\ldots \\le \\lambda_n(\\mathcal{L})$.\nThe smallest eigenvalue occurs at $j=0$:\n$\\lambda_1(\\mathcal{L}) = 1 - \\cos(0) = 1 - 1 = 0$. This corresponds to the connected component of the graph.\nThe function $f(x) = 1-\\cos(x)$ is non-negative and increasing for $x \\in [0, \\pi]$. The arguments $\\frac{2\\pi j}{n}$ for $j=1, 2, \\ldots, \\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$ lie in this range. The second smallest eigenvalue, $\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L})$, corresponds to the smallest non-zero argument, which is for $j=1$.\nThus, the second smallest eigenvalue is:\n$$\n\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L}) = 1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{n}\\right)\n$$\nNote that this eigenvalue has multiplicity $2$ (coming from $j=1$ and $j=n-1$) since $\\cos(2\\pi/n) = \\cos(2\\pi(n-1)/n)$. So technically $\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L}) = \\lambda_3(\\mathcal{L})$.\n\n**3. Asymptotic Scaling and the Cheeger Inequality**\n\nThe Cheeger inequality relates the conductance to the second smallest eigenvalue of the normalized Laplacian:\n$$\n\\frac{\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L})}{2} \\le \\phi(G) \\le \\sqrt{2\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L})}\n$$\nLet's analyze the leading-order asymptotic scaling of our derived quantities as $n \\to \\infty$.\n\nFor the conductance:\n$\\phi(C_n) = \\frac{1}{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor}$. As $n \\to \\infty$, $\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor \\approx n/2$.\nSo, $\\phi(C_n) \\sim \\frac{1}{n/2} = \\frac{2}{n}$. The conductance scales as $O(n^{-1})$.\n\nFor the eigenvalue:\n$\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L}) = 1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{n}\\right)$. For large $n$, the argument $\\frac{2\\pi}{n}$ is small. We use the Taylor series expansion of $\\cos(x)$ around $x=0$, which is $\\cos(x) = 1 - \\frac{x^2}{2!} + O(x^4)$.\n$$\n\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L}) = 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{n}\\right)^2 + O(n^{-4})\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{4\\pi^2}{n^2} + O(n^{-4}) = \\frac{2\\pi^2}{n^2} + O(n^{-4})\n$$\nSo, $\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L}) \\sim \\frac{2\\pi^2}{n^2}$. The eigenvalue scales as $O(n^{-2})$.\n\nThese scalings align with the qualitative expectations from the Cheeger inequality. As $n \\to \\infty$, both $\\phi(C_n)$ and $\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L})$ approach $0$. This reflects the fact that a long cycle graph is \"easy to cut\" and is thus a poor expander graph. The Cheeger inequality provides the formal link: a small spectral gap $\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L})$ implies a small conductance $\\phi(G)$.\n\nMore quantitatively, let's check the scaling in the inequality:\n- Lower bound: $\\frac{\\lambda_2}{2} \\sim \\frac{\\pi^2}{n^2}$, which is $O(n^{-2})$.\n- Conductance: $\\phi \\sim \\frac{2}{n}$, which is $O(n^{-1})$.\n- Upper bound: $\\sqrt{2\\lambda_2} \\sim \\sqrt{2 \\cdot \\frac{2\\pi^2}{n^2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4\\pi^2}{n^2}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{n}$, which is $O(n^{-1})$.\n\nThe inequality $O(n^{-2}) \\le O(n^{-1}) \\le O(n^{-1})$ holds for large $n$. Notably, the asymptotic scaling of the conductance $\\phi(C_n)$ matches that of the Cheeger upper bound $\\sqrt{2\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L})}$. This indicates that for the family of cycle graphs, the upper bound of the Cheeger inequality is asymptotically tight up to a constant factor ($\\pi$ in this case). This provides a concrete verification of the deep connection between the geometric property of conductance and the algebraic property of the Laplacian spectrum.\n\nThe required closed-form expressions are $\\phi(C_n) = \\frac{1}{\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor}$ and $\\lambda_2(\\mathcal{L}) = 1 - \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{n}\\right)$.",
