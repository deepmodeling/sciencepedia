            "problem": "Consider the Independent Cascade (IC) diffusion model on a directed graph with node set $V=\\{1,2,3,4\\}$. Each directed edge $(u,v)$ is associated with a transmission probability $p_{uv}\\in[0,1]$, and all edge transmission events are independent. Under the IC dynamics, a node that becomes active at time $t$ gets exactly one chance at time $t+1$ to activate each currently inactive out-neighbor $v$, which succeeds with probability $p_{uv}$; once a node has attempted to activate all its out-neighbors, it becomes inactive permanently and never attempts again. The process starts from the seed set $S=\\{1\\}$ at time $t=0$ and runs until no further activations occur. It is known that the expected size of the final active set under the IC model equals the expected number of nodes reachable from the seed set in the corresponding live-edge representation, where each directed edge $(u,v)$ is independently declared live with probability $p_{uv}$ and blocked otherwise.\n\nThe directed edges and their transmission probabilities are:\n- $(1,2)$ with $p_{12}=0.5$,\n- $(2,3)$ with $p_{23}=0.4$,\n- $(1,3)$ with $p_{13}=0.2$,\n- $(3,4)$ with $p_{34}=0.3$.\n\nUsing the live-edge interpretation and exact enumeration of the outcomes and reachable sets implied by the independent edge realizations, compute the expected influence spread $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{IC}}(\\{1\\})$, defined as the expected number of nodes active at termination, including the seed node.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the expected influence spread, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{IC}}(\\{1\\})$, for the Independent Cascade (IC) model on a given directed graph. The seed set is $S=\\{1\\}$. The problem specifies using the live-edge graph interpretation.\n\nAccording to the provided definition, the expected influence spread $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{IC}}(S)$ is equal to the expected number of nodes reachable from the seed set $S$ in the live-edge graph realization. In a live-edge graph $G'$, each edge $(u,v)$ of the original graph is present (i.e., \"live\") with probability $p_{uv}$, independently of all other edges.\n\nThe expected number of reachable nodes can be calculated using the linearity of expectation. Let $R(S, G')$ be the set of nodes reachable from $S$ in a specific live-edge graph realization $G'$. The expected spread is the expectation of the size of this set over all possible realizations:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{IC}}(S) = E\\left[|R(S, G')|\\right] $$\nBy linearity of expectation, this can be expressed as the sum of the probabilities that each node $v \\in V$ is reachable from $S$:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{IC}}(S) = E\\left[\\sum_{v \\in V} \\mathbf{1}_{v \\in R(S, G')}\\right] = \\sum_{v \\in V} E\\left[\\mathbf{1}_{v \\in R(S, G')}\\right] = \\sum_{v \\in V} P(v \\text{ is reachable from } S) $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{1}_{v \\in R(S, G')}$ is the indicator function that is $1$ if node $v$ is reachable from $S$ and $0$ otherwise.\n\nThe node set is $V=\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ and the seed set is $S=\\{1\\}$. We will compute the probability of each node being reachable from node $1$. The given edge probabilities are:\n$p_{12}=0.5 = \\frac{1}{2}$\n$p_{23}=0.4 = \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5}$\n$p_{13}=0.2 = \\frac{2}{10} = \\frac{1}{5}$\n$p_{34}=0.3 = \\frac{3}{10}$\n\nWe now compute the reachability probability for each node $v \\in V$.\n\n1.  **Node 1:** The seed node $1$ is always considered reachable from itself.\n    $$ P(1 \\text{ is reachable from } \\{1\\}) = 1 $$\n\n2.  **Node 2:** Node $2$ is reachable from $1$ if and only if the direct edge $(1,2)$ is live. There is only one path from $1$ to $2$.\n    $$ P(2 \\text{ is reachable from } \\{1\\}) = p_{12} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n\n3.  **Node 3:** Node $3$ is reachable from $1$ if there is at least one live path from $1$ to $3$. The possible paths are the direct edge $(1,3)$ and the path $1 \\to 2 \\to 3$ via edges $(1,2)$ and $(2,3)$. Let $P_1$ be the event that the direct path $1 \\to 3$ is live, and $P_2$ be the event that the path $1 \\to 2 \\to 3$ is live.\n    -   $P(P_1) = p_{13}$\n    -   $P(P_2) = p_{12} \\times p_{23}$ (due to independence of edges)\n    The reachability of node $3$ is the event $P_1 \\cup P_2$. The probability is most easily calculated using the complement rule: the probability of being reachable is $1$ minus the probability of not being reachable. Node $3$ is not reachable if and only if both path options are blocked. That is, the edge $(1,3)$ must be blocked, AND the path $1 \\to 2 \\to 3$ must be blocked. The path $1 \\to 2 \\to 3$ is blocked if edge $(1,2)$ is blocked OR edge $(2,3)$ is blocked.\n    Let $B_{uv}$ be the event that edge $(u,v)$ is blocked, so $P(B_{uv}) = 1-p_{uv}$.\n    $$ P(3 \\text{ is not reachable from } \\{1\\}) = P(B_{13} \\text{ and } (B_{12} \\text{ or } B_{23})) $$\n    Since the liveness of edge $(1,3)$ is independent of the other edges, we have:\n    $$ P(3 \\text{ is not reachable}) = P(B_{13}) \\times P(B_{12} \\text{ or } B_{23}) $$\n    $$ P(B_{12} \\text{ or } B_{23}) = 1 - P(\\text{not}(B_{12} \\text{ or } B_{23})) = 1 - P(\\text{not } B_{12} \\text{ and not } B_{23}) = 1 - p_{12}p_{23} $$\n    Therefore,\n    $$ P(3 \\text{ is not reachable}) = (1 - p_{13})(1 - p_{12}p_{23}) $$\n    And the probability that node $3$ is reachable is:\n    $$ P(3 \\text{ is reachable}) = 1 - (1 - p_{13})(1 - p_{12}p_{23}) $$\n    Substituting the values:\n    $p_{12}p_{23} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{1}{5}$.\n    $$ P(3 \\text{ is reachable}) = 1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{5}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{5}\\right) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right)\\left(\\frac{4}{5}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{16}{25} = \\frac{9}{25} $$\n\n4.  **Node 4:** Node $4$ is reachable from $1$ if and only if there's a live path from $1$ to $4$. The only edge leading to node $4$ is $(3,4)$. Thus, for node $4$ to be reachable from $1$, node $3$ must be reachable from $1$, AND the edge $(3,4)$ must be live.\n    Let $R_{13}$ be the event that node $3$ is reachable from $1$, and $L_{34}$ be the event that edge $(3,4)$ is live.\n    $$ P(4 \\text{ is reachable from } \\{1\\}) = P(R_{13} \\cap L_{34}) $$\n    The event $R_{13}$ depends on the states of edges $(1,2)$, $(2,3)$, and $(1,3)$. The event $L_{34}$ depends only on the state of edge $(3,4)$. Since these edge sets are disjoint, the events $R_{13}$ and $L_{34}$ are independent.\n    $$ P(4 \\text{ is reachable}) = P(R_{13}) \\times P(L_{34}) = P(3 \\text{ is reachable}) \\times p_{34} $$\n    Substituting the previously calculated probability for node $3$:\n    $$ P(4 \\text{ is reachable}) = \\frac{9}{25} \\times \\frac{3}{10} = \\frac{27}{250} $$\n\nFinally, we sum the probabilities for each node to find the expected total number of active nodes:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{IC}}(\\{1\\}) = \\sum_{v \\in \\{1,2,3,4\\}} P(v \\text{ is reachable from } \\{1\\}) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{IC}}(\\{1\\}) = P(1 \\text{ reachable}) + P(2 \\text{ reachable}) + P(3 \\text{ reachable}) + P(4 \\text{ reachable}) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{IC}}(\\{1\\}) = 1 + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{9}{25} + \\frac{27}{250} $$\nTo sum these fractions, we find a common denominator, which is $250$.\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{IC}}(\\{1\\}) = \\frac{250}{250} + \\frac{125}{250} + \\frac{90}{250} + \\frac{27}{250} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{IC}}(\\{1\\}) = \\frac{250 + 125 + 90 + 27}{250} = \\frac{492}{250} $$\nThis fraction can be simplified by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $2$.\n$$ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{IC}}(\\{1\\}) = \\frac{246}{125} $$\nThe fraction is now in its simplest form, as the prime factorization of the numerator is $2 \\times 3 \\times 41$ and the denominator is $5^3$.",

The term involving the indicator function is also non-negative, because if $\\{y_1, y_2\\} \\subseteq A$, then it must also be that $\\{y_1, y_2\\} \\subseteq A \\cup \\{e\\}$. Thus, the difference of the indicators is either $0$ or $1$. The marginal gain is therefore always greater than $0$, so $F(A \\cup \\{e\\}) > F(A)$. By induction, $F$ is strictly monotone.\n\nTo prove that $F$ is not submodular, we must find a counterexample to the submodularity condition, which states that for any $A \\subseteq B \\subseteq V$ and $e \\in V \\setminus B$, it must be that $F(A \\cup \\{e\\}) - F(A) \\ge F(B \\cup \\{e\\}) - F(B)$. Consider the synergistic elements $y_1$ and $y_2$. Let $e = y_2$. Let $A = \\varnothing$ and $B = \\{y_1\\}$. Clearly $A \\subseteq B$ and $e \\notin B$.\nLet's compute the marginal gain of $e$ with respect to $A$:\n$$\nF(A \\cup \\{e\\}) - F(A) = F(\\{y_2\\}) - F(\\varnothing) = 1 - 0 = 1\n$$\nNow, let's compute the marginal gain of $e$ with respect to $B$:\n$$\nF(B \\cup \\{e\\}) - F(B) = F(\\{y_1, y_2\\}) - F(\\{y_1\\})\n$$\nUsing the definition of $F$, we have $F(\\{y_1\\}) = 1$ and $F(\\{y_1, y_2\\}) = F(\\{y_1\\}) + F(\\{y_2\\}) + 20 = 1 + 1 + 20 = 22$.\nThe marginal gain is $22 - 1 = 21$.\nComparing the two marginal gains, we find that $1 < 21$. This means $F(A \\cup \\{e\\}) - F(A) < F(B \\cup \\{e\\}) - F(B)$, which is a violation of the submodularity condition. Therefore, $F$ is not submodular.\n\nThe third task is to run the greedy algorithm on $F$ with a cardinality constraint $k=2$, find the greedy solution value $G$, find the optimal solution value $O$, and compute the ratio $G/O$.\n\nGreedy Algorithm Run ($k=2$):\nStep 1: Start with $S_0 = \\varnothing$. We need to find the element with the highest marginal gain relative to $\\varnothing$. The gains are simply the singleton values:\n- Gain of $x_1$: $F(\\{x_1\\}) - F(\\varnothing) = 5 - 0 = 5$.\n- Gain of $x_2$: $F(\\{x_2\\}) - F(\\varnothing) = 5 - 0 = 5$.\n- Gain of $y_1$: $F(\\{y_1\\}) - F(\\varnothing) = 1 - 0 = 1$.\n- Gain of $y_2$: $F(\\{y_2\\}) - F(\\varnothing) = 1 - 0 = 1$.\nThe maximum gain is $5$, corresponding to either $x_1$ or $x_2$. Let's select $e_1=x_1$. The greedy set is now $S_1 = \\{x_1\\}$.\n\nStep 2: We need to find the element in $V \\setminus S_1 = \\{x_2, y_1, y_2\\}$ with the highest marginal gain relative to $S_1 = \\{x_1\\}$.\n- Gain of $x_2$: $F(\\{x_1, x_2\\}) - F(\\{x_1\\}) = (F(\\{x_1\\}) + F(\\{x_2\\})) - F(\\{x_1\\}) = (5+5)-5 = 5$.\n- Gain of $y_1$: $F(\\{x_1, y_1\\}) - F(\\{x_1\\}) = (F(\\{x_1\\}) + F(\\{y_1\\})) - F(\\{x_1\\}) = (5+1)-5 = 1$.\n- Gain of $y_2$: $F(\\{x_1, y_2\\}) - F(\\{x_1\\}) = (F(\\{x_1\\}) + F(\\{y_2\\})) - F(\\{x_1\\}) = (5+1)-5 = 1$.\nThe maximum marginal gain is $5$, corresponding to $x_2$. So we select $e_2=x_2$. The final greedy set is $S_2 = \\{x_1, x_2\\}$.\nThe value of the greedy solution is $G = F(S_2) = F(\\{x_1, x_2\\}) = 5 + 5 = 10$.\n\nOptimal Solution ($k=2$):\nWe need to find $O = \\max_{|S|=2} F(S)$. We evaluate $F(S)$ for all $\\binom{4}{2}=6$ possible pairs:\n- $F(\\{x_1, x_2\\}) = 5 + 5 = 10$.\n- $F(\\{x_1, y_1\\}) = 5 + 1 = 6$.\n- $F(\\{x_1, y_2\\}) = 5 + 1 = 6$.\n- $F(\\{x_2, y_1\\}) = 5 + 1 = 6$.\n- $F(\\{x_2, y_2\\}) = 5 + 1 = 6$.\n- $F(\\{y_1, y_2\\}) = 1 + 1 + 20 = 22$.\nThe maximum value among all pairs is $22$. So the optimal value is $O=22$, achieved by the set $S^{\\star} = \\{y_1, y_2\\}$.\n\nApproximation Ratio:\nThe greedy algorithm found a solution with value $G=10$, while the optimal solution has a value of $O=22$. The approximation ratio is:\n$$\n\\frac{G}{O} = \\frac{10}{22} = \\frac{5}{11}\n$$",
            "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{5}{11}}$$"
