            "problem": "Consider the Watts–Strogatz (WS) small-world network model defined as follows. Start with a ring of $N$ vertices, each connected symmetrically to its $2m$ nearest neighbors, so every vertex has degree $2m$. Then, for each edge, with probability $p \\in [0,1]$ independently, rewire one end of the edge to a uniformly random vertex chosen from those that avoid multi-edges and self-loops. Assume $N$ is large and focus on the regime of small $p$.\n\nLet the global clustering coefficient $C(p)$ be the average of the local clustering coefficients, where for a vertex $i$ with degree $k_i$, the local clustering coefficient is defined by $C_i = T_i/\\binom{k_i}{2}$, with $T_i$ the number of edges among the neighbors of $i$. Denote by $C(0)$ the clustering coefficient of the initial regular ring at $p=0$.\n\nUsing only the definitions above and mean-field reasoning grounded in the network construction rules, derive a closed-form leading-order expression for $C(p)$ as a function of $C(0)$ and $p$ in the limit of small $p$. Your derivation must begin from the definition of the clustering coefficient and from the independence of edge rewiring events in the construction, and must include a clear justification of any independence assumptions you invoke regarding the fate of edges that form a triangle at $p=0$. Express your final answer as a single analytic expression in terms of $C(0)$ and $p$. No numerical approximation or rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is a valid, well-posed problem in the field of network science. We may proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe global clustering coefficient, $C(p)$, is defined as the average of the local clustering coefficients, $C_i$, over all $N$ vertices in the network. For a large network ($N \\to \\infty$), we can approximate this average by the expected value of the local clustering coefficient for a single, arbitrary vertex $i$.\n$$\nC(p) = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} C_i(p) \\approx \\mathbb{E}[C_i(p)]\n$$\nThe local clustering coefficient for a vertex $i$ is given by the ratio of the number of triangles connected to vertex $i$, denoted $T_i$, to the maximum possible number of such triangles, which is the number of pairs of neighbors of $i$, $\\binom{k_i}{2}$, where $k_i$ is the degree of vertex $i$.\n$$\nC_i(p) = \\frac{T_i(p)}{\\binom{k_i(p)}{2}}\n$$\nThus, we can write the global clustering coefficient as:\n$$\nC(p) \\approx \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{T_i(p)}{\\binom{k_i(p)}{2}}\\right]\n$$\nIn the mean-field approximation, particularly for small $p$, we assume that the fluctuations in the denominator are small and approximate the expectation of the ratio by the ratio of the expectations:\n$$\nC(p) \\approx \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[T_i(p)]}{\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\binom{k_i(p)}{2}\\right]}\n$$\nLet us first analyze the denominator. In the initial regular lattice at $p=0$, every vertex has a degree of exactly $2m$. When rewiring is introduced, the degree of a vertex $i$, $k_i(p)$, may change. An edge $(i, j)$ incident on vertex $i$ can be rewired. Following the problem's description, \"rewire one end of the edge\", let's assume this means for an edge $(u,v)$, one end (say $v$) is detached and re-attached to a random vertex $w$. In this case, the degree of $u$ is unchanged, the degree of $v$ decreases by $1$, and the degree of $w$ increases by $1$. On average, across the entire network, the degree of any given vertex is not expected to change. The expected number of edges lost by a vertex $i$ is balanced by the expected number of new edges gained from the pool of all rewired edges in the network. Thus, $\\mathbb{E}[k_i(p)] = k_i(0) = 2m$. For small $p$, the degree distribution will be sharply peaked around $2m$. We can therefore approximate the expected value of the denominator by its value at $p=0$:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\binom{k_i(p)}{2}\\right] \\approx \\binom{\\mathbb{E}[k_i(p)]}{2} = \\binom{2m}{2}\n$$\nNow, let us analyze the numerator, $\\mathbb{E}[T_i(p)]$. This is the expected number of triangles incident on vertex $i$. The rewiring process primarily acts to destroy triangles that exist in the original regular lattice. While new triangles can be formed by chance, this is a much rarer event for large $N$. A new triangle is formed if a rewired edge $(u,w)$ connects to a vertex $w$ that happens to be a neighbor of $u$. The probability of picking such a specific vertex $w$ from approximately $N$ choices is of order $k_u/N \\approx 2m/N$. The creation of new triangles is therefore a second-order effect, proportional to $p/N$, which we neglect in this leading-order analysis.\n\nThe dominant effect for small $p$ is the destruction of triangles that existed at $p=0$. Let $T_i(0)$ be the number of triangles connected to vertex $i$ in the initial lattice. A triangle is composed of three edges. For a triangle to survive the rewiring process, all three of its constituent edges must escape being rewired.\n\nThe problem states that \"for each edge, with probability $p$ independently, rewire one end\". This independence is the key to our reasoning. Let us consider a single triangle $(i, j, k)$ from the initial lattice. It consists of the edges $(i,j)$, $(i,k)$, and $(j,k)$.\nThe probability that any given edge is selected for rewiring is $p$.\nThe probability that any given edge is *not* selected for rewiring (i.e., survives) is $1-p$.\n\nFor the entire triangle $(i, j, k)$ to survive, all three of its edges must survive. Since the rewiring events for each edge are independent, the probability of the triangle surviving is the product of the individual survival probabilities of its three edges:\n$$\nP(\\text{triangle survives}) = P(\\text{edge 1 survives}) \\times P(\\text{edge 2 survives}) \\times P(\\text{edge 3 survives}) = (1-p) \\times (1-p) \\times (1-p) = (1-p)^3\n$$\nThe expected number of triangles connected to vertex $i$ at a rewiring probability $p$, $\\mathbb{E}[T_i(p)]$, is the initial number of triangles, $T_i(0)$, multiplied by the probability that any one of them survives.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[T_i(p)] \\approx T_i(0) \\times (1-p)^3\n$$\nWe can now assemble the expression for $C(p)$:\n$$\nC(p) \\approx \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[T_i(p)]}{\\binom{2m}{2}} \\approx \\frac{T_i(0) (1-p)^3}{\\binom{2m}{2}}\n$$\nWe recognize that the clustering coefficient of the initial regular lattice, $C(0)$, is given by:\n$$\nC(0) = \\frac{T_i(0)}{\\binom{k_i(0)}{2}} = \\frac{T_i(0)}{\\binom{2m}{2}}\n$$\nThis is because a regular lattice is vertex-transitive, so the local clustering coefficient is the same for all vertices, $C_i(0) = C(0)$.\n\nSubstituting this into our expression for $C(p)$, we arrive at the final relationship:\n$$\nC(p) \\approx C(0) (1-p)^3\n$$\nThis is the desired closed-form leading-order expression for $C(p)$ as a function of $C(0)$ and $p$ under the specified conditions.",

A network is typically considered small-world if $\\sigma  1$.\n    The normalized clustering coefficient is:\n    $$\\gamma = \\dfrac{C}{C_{\\mathrm{rand}}} \\approx \\dfrac{0.02}{0.01001} \\approx 1.998$$\n    The normalized characteristic path length is:\n    $$\\lambda = \\dfrac{L}{L_{\\mathrm{rand}}} \\approx \\dfrac{2.5}{3} \\approx 0.833$$\n    Substituting these values into the formula for $\\sigma$:\n    $$\\sigma = \\dfrac{\\gamma}{\\lambda} \\approx \\dfrac{1.998}{0.833} \\approx 2.398$$\n    Since $\\sigma \\approx 2.4  1$, the $\\sigma$ metric classifies the network $G$ as a small-world network.\n\n2.  **Interpolative Statistic ($\\omega$):**\n    The definition is $\\omega \\equiv \\dfrac{L_{\\mathrm{rand}}}{L} - \\dfrac{C}{C_{\\mathrm{latt}}}$. The interpretation is given as $\\omega \\approx 0$ for small-world, $\\omega \\approx 1$ for random-like, and $\\omega \\approx -1$ for lattice-like.\n    The first term is the inverse of the normalized path length:\n    $$\\dfrac{L_{\\mathrm{rand}}}{L} \\approx \\dfrac{3}{2.5} = 1.2$$\n    The second term measures clustering relative to the lattice baseline:\n    $$\\dfrac{C}{C_{\\mathrm{latt}}} \\approx \\dfrac{0.02}{2/3} = 0.02 \\times 1.5 = 0.03$$\n    Substituting these values into the formula for $\\omega$:\n    $$\\omega = \\dfrac{L_{\\mathrm{rand}}}{L} - \\dfrac{C}{C_{\\mathrm{latt}}} \\approx 1.2 - 0.03 = 1.17$$\n    Since $\\omega \\approx 1.17$, which is very close to $1$, the $\\omega$ metric classifies the network $G$ as random-like.\n\n**Analysis of Disagreement:**\nThe two metrics provide conflicting classifications: $\\sigma$ indicates \"small-world\", while $\\omega$ indicates \"random-like\". The reason for this disagreement lies in how each metric processes the network's properties relative to the baselines.\n- The network's clustering $C = 0.02$ is about twice that of the random graph ($C_{\\mathrm{rand}} \\approx 0.01$), but it is minuscule compared to the lattice clustering ($C_{\\mathrm{latt}} \\approx 0.67$).\n- The network's path length $L = 2.5$ is not just \"of the same order as\" the random graph's path length ($L_{\\mathrm{rand}} \\approx 3$), but is actually slightly *shorter*.\n\nThe $\\sigma$ metric is a ratio of ratios. The numerator, $C/C_{\\mathrm{rand}} \\approx 2$, is greater than $1$. The denominator, $L/L_{\\mathrm{rand}} \\approx 0.833$, is less than $1$. A denominator less than $1$ inflates the value of the overall fraction. Thus, the condition $L  L_{\\mathrm{rand}}$ significantly contributes to the large value of $\\sigma$, even though the clustering signal ($C/C_{\\mathrm{rand}} \\approx 2$) is modest.\n\nThe $\\omega$ metric is a difference. The term $L_{\\mathrm{rand}}/L \\approx 1.2$ is close to $1$, indicating that the path length is random-like. The term $C/C_{\\mathrm{latt}} \\approx 0.03$ is close to $0$, indicating that the clustering is far from lattice-like and much closer to the random baseline value. The resulting $\\omega \\approx 1.17$ reflects a position on the lattice-random spectrum that is very close to the random endpoint ($\\omega=1$).\n\nThe disagreement is thus caused by the network having a path length at or below the random baseline ($L \\lesssim L_{\\mathrm{rand}}$) and clustering that is only modestly above the random baseline ($C \\approx 2 C_{\\mathrm{rand}}$) while being far from the lattice baseline ($C \\ll C_{\\mathrm{latt}}$). These specific conditions inflate $\\sigma$ while driving $\\omega$ towards the random regime.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n- **A.** This option states that $\\sigma  1$ classifies $G$ as small-world, while $\\omega \\approx 1$ classifies it as random-like. This matches our calculations. It then explains the disagreement by noting that $L$ is below the random baseline, $C$ is modestly above $C_{\\mathrm{rand}}$ but far below $C_{\\mathrm{latt}}$, which inflates $\\sigma$ and pushes $\\omega$ towards the random value. This explanation is entirely consistent with our analysis. **Correct.**\n\n- **B.** This option claims both metrics classify $G$ as small-world. This is false, as $\\omega \\approx 1.17$ indicates a random-like network. It also incorrectly claims $C \\approx C_{\\mathrm{latt}}$, which is grossly inaccurate ($0.02$ vs. $\\approx 0.67$), and that this leads to $\\omega \\approx 0$, which is also false. **Incorrect.**\n\n- **C.** This option claims $\\sigma  1$ and $\\omega \\approx -1$, classifying the network as not small-world or lattice-like. Both calculations are wrong ($\\sigma \\approx 2.4$, $\\omega \\approx 1.17$). The network's short path length is the opposite of a lattice-like feature. **Incorrect.**\n\n- **D.** This option claims both metrics classify $G$ as small-world because they agree ($\\omega \\approx 0$). This is false; the metrics disagree, and our calculation shows $\\omega \\approx 1.17$, not $\\approx 0$. **Incorrect.**",

Through a tangible calculation, you will see how a single new shortcut can cause a much larger relative change in $E$ than in $L$, making it a superior tool for detecting the very onset of the small-world phenomenon .

            "problem": "Consider the Watts–Strogatz (WS) model of a small-world network. In this model, one starts from a ring lattice on $N$ vertices in which each vertex is connected to $k/2$ nearest neighbors on each side (so the degree is $k$ with $k$ even), and then independently rewires each existing edge with probability $p$ by detaching one end and reconnecting it to a uniformly random vertex, avoiding self-loops and multi-edges. The small-world phenomenon refers to the regime of high local clustering while typical distances are comparable to those of a random graph. Two distance-based summaries are often used: the average shortest-path length $L$ and the global efficiency $E$. By definition,\n$$\nL = \\frac{1}{N(N-1)} \\sum_{i \\neq j} d_{ij}, \\qquad E = \\frac{1}{N(N-1)} \\sum_{i \\neq j} \\frac{1}{d_{ij}},\n$$\nwhere $d_{ij}$ is the graph-theoretic shortest-path distance between vertices $i$ and $j$. Global efficiency $E$ is the network-level average of pairwise communication efficiencies $1/d_{ij}$ and is widely used in complex systems as a distance-sensitive alternative to $L$.\n\nUsing only these core definitions and the WS rewiring mechanism, reason qualitatively about how $L$ and $E$ behave as $p$ increases from $0$. Then, construct and analyze a concrete numerical scenario that isolates the earliest detectable impact of a single shortcut on $L$ and $E$. To keep the calculation tractable while faithfully capturing the first-order effect of a single shortcut at very small $p$, consider the cycle graph on $N=100$ vertices and insert one long-range edge connecting antipodal vertices (i.e., add a single edge to the ring between two vertices whose ring distance is $N/2 = 50$). This augmentation approximates the net impact of a single rewiring event at $p \\approx 1/M$ when $k$ is at least moderately large, where $M$ is the number of edges, while avoiding local disruptions that complicate exact counting; it thus provides a conservative lower bound on the immediate distance reductions caused by the shortcut.\n\nCompute the baseline $L$ and $E$ for the cycle $C_{100}$ and then the absolute and relative changes $\\Delta L$ and $\\Delta E$ caused by the added antipodal shortcut, using only the fact that at least the antipodal pair’s distance drops from $50$ to $1$. You may use the exact pair-distance multiplicities on the cycle to obtain the baseline values, but do not invoke any shortcut formulas beyond the definitions and simple summations.\n\nWhich of the following statements are correct?\n\nA. As $p$ increases from $0$ in the WS model, $L$ decreases in expectation and $E$ increases in expectation; for very small $p$ these changes appear first through rare long-range shortcuts that affect a small fraction of pairs with initially large $d_{ij}$, yielding a larger relative change in $E$ than in $L$ because $E$ is a harmonic average that is more sensitive to improvements on large distances.\n\nB. On the $C_{100}$ example with one antipodal shortcut (corresponding to $p \\approx 0.01$ when $k=2$ and $M=100$), $L$ and $E$ change by approximately the same relative amount, so $E$ does not detect small-world behavior earlier than $L$.\n\nC. In WS networks, for any single shortcut created at small $p$, the fractional decrease in $L$ always exceeds the fractional increase in $E$, implying $L$ is the earlier detector of small-world behavior.\n\nD. For $C_{100}$, the baseline values are $L_0 \\approx 25.2525$ and $E_0 \\approx 0.0907$. Adding one antipodal shortcut yields $\\Delta L \\approx -0.0099$ and $\\Delta E \\approx +0.000198$, which correspond to relative changes of approximately $-0.039\\%$ for $L$ and $+0.218\\%$ for $E$, demonstrating that $E$ signals the onset of small-world behavior earlier.\n\nE. In the limit $N \\to \\infty$ at fixed degree $k$, the first derivative $\\frac{dE}{dp}\\big|_{p=0}$ is $0$, while $\\frac{dL}{dp}\\big|_{p=0}  0$, so $L$ is strictly more sensitive than $E$ to infinitesimal rewiring.\n\nSelect all that apply.",

We must evaluate five statements.\n\n**Qualitative Analysis (Statements A and E):**\n\nStatement A is qualitatively correct. When a few long-range shortcuts are introduced into a regular lattice (the regime of small $p$ in the WS model), they drastically reduce the large distances between a few pairs of vertices.\n- The average path length $L$ is an arithmetic mean of distances. A large decrease in a few $d_{ij}$ terms, out of $N(N-1)$ total terms, leads to a small decrease in $L$.\n- The global efficiency $E$ is an arithmetic mean of reciprocal distances ($1/d_{ij}$). The change in efficiency, $1/d_{ij}^{\\text{new}} - 1/d_{ij}^{\\text{old}}$, is largest when a large distance $d_{ij}^{\\text{old}}$ is replaced by a small one (e.g., 1). A change from $d=50$ to $d=1$ changes the efficiency term from $0.02$ to $1$, a 50-fold increase. This large jump in a few terms gives $E$ a strong signal, making its relative change larger than that of $L$. Thus, $E$ is more sensitive to the onset of the small-world transition.\n\nStatement E is incorrect. The expected change in both $L$ and $E$ is proportional to the probability of creating at least one shortcut, which is proportional to $p$ for small $p$. Therefore, both $\\mathbb{E}[L(p)]$ and $\\mathbb{E}[E(p)]$ are expected to change linearly with $p$ near $p=0$. This implies that their first derivatives at $p=0$ are non-zero.

Our calculation is a direct counterexample, as the fractional increase in $E$ is larger than the fractional decrease in $L$.\n- **D**: Correct. All numerical values and the conclusion match our calculation.\n- **E**: Incorrect, as per qualitative analysis.\n\nTherefore, statements A and D are correct.",
