            "problem": "Neuroscientists are developing a simplified probabilistic model for the connectivity of a local brain region. The model consists of $n$ neurons, treated as nodes in a graph. A bidirectional synaptic link, representing a functional connection, is assumed to exist between any pair of distinct neurons with a fixed probability $p$. The formation of a link between any one pair of neurons is statistically independent of the formation of all other links. The total number of such links in the network is a key measure of its overall connectivity.\n\nBased on this model, what is the expected total number of bidirectional synaptic links in the network? Express your answer as a closed-form analytic expression in terms of $n$ and $p$.",

            "problem": "A large-scale decentralized communication network is being designed, comprising $n$ sensor nodes. The connectivity of this network is modeled using the Erdős-Rényi random graph framework, denoted as $G(n,p)$. In this model, the $n$ nodes are represented as vertices, and a direct communication link (an edge) is established between any pair of distinct nodes independently with a probability $p$.\n\nA fundamental requirement for the network's operation is that no node is completely cut off from the system. This property corresponds to the graph having no isolated vertices. An isolated vertex is a vertex with a degree of zero.\n\nThe emergence of this property in the network is known to exhibit a sharp threshold phenomenon. A function $t(n)$ is called a threshold probability function for a given graph property if, for a link probability $p(n)$:\n- if $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{p(n)}{t(n)} = 0$, then the property almost surely does not occur (the probability of it occurring tends to 0 as $n \\to \\infty$).\n- if $\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{p(n)}{t(n)} = \\infty$, then the property almost surely does occur (the probability of it occurring tends to 1 as $n \\to \\infty$).\n\nDetermine the threshold probability function $t(n)$ for the property that the graph $G(n,p)$ has no isolated vertices. Your answer should be an analytical expression in terms of $n$.",
            "solution": "Consider $G(n,p)$ and let $I_{v}$ be the indicator that vertex $v$ is isolated. A vertex is isolated if none of its $n-1$ incident edges are present, so $\\Pr(I_{v}=1)=(1-p)^{n-1}$. Let $X=\\sum_{v=1}^{n} I_{v}$ denote the number of isolated vertices. Then\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[X]=n(1-p)^{n-1}.\n$$\nA threshold function $t(n)$ satisfies: if $p(n)/t(n)\\to 0$ then the property fails almost surely, and if $p(n)/t(n)\\to \\infty$ then the property holds almost surely. Heuristically, the threshold is found by solving $\\mathbb{E}[X]\\approx 1$. Using $(1-p)^{n-1}=\\exp\\big((n-1)\\ln(1-p)\\big)\\approx \\exp(-(n-1)p)$ for small $p$, the equation $n\\exp(-(n-1)p)\\approx 1$ gives $p\\approx \\frac{\\ln n}{n}$, suggesting $t(n)=\\frac{\\ln n}{n}$. We now verify both directions.\n\nFirst, suppose $p(n)\\gg \\frac{\\ln n}{n}$.

Hence $\\Pr(X0)\\to 1$, i.e., the graph has at least one isolated vertex with probability tending to $1$, so the property of having no isolated vertices fails almost surely.\n\nThese two regimes establish that the threshold probability function for having no isolated vertices is $t(n)=\\frac{\\ln n}{n}$.",
