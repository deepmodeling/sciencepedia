            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the ratio of the mean to the median for a Pareto (Type I) distribution, starting from first principles. The problem is well-posed, scientifically sound, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\nFirst, we derive the cumulative distribution function (CDF), $F(x)$, from the given probability density function (PDF), $f(x) = \\alpha x_{\\min}^{\\alpha} x^{-(\\alpha+1)}$ for $x \\ge x_{\\min}$. The CDF is defined as $F(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{x} f(t) dt$. Since the support of the distribution is $[x_{\\min}, \\infty)$, the PDF is zero for $t  x_{\\min}$. Therefore, for any $x \\ge x_{\\min}$, the CDF is given by the integral:\n$$F(x) = \\int_{x_{\\min}}^{x} f(t) dt = \\int_{x_{\\min}}^{x} \\alpha x_{\\min}^{\\alpha} t^{-(\\alpha+1)} dt$$\nWe can factor out the constants with respect to the integration variable $t$:\n$$F(x) = \\alpha x_{\\min}^{\\alpha} \\int_{x_{\\min}}^{x} t^{-(\\alpha+1)} dt$$\nThe integral of $t^n$ is $\\frac{t^{n+1}}{n+1}$. Here, the exponent is $-(\\alpha+1)$, so the integral evaluates to:\n$$F(x) = \\alpha x_{\\min}^{\\alpha} \\left[ \\frac{t^{-(\\alpha+1)+1}}{-(\\alpha+1)+1} \\right]_{x_{\\min}}^{x} = \\alpha x_{\\min}^{\\alpha} \\left[ \\frac{t^{-\\alpha}}{-\\alpha} \\right]_{x_{\\min}}^{x}$$\nEvaluating the expression at the limits of integration:\n$$F(x) = \\alpha x_{\\min}^{\\alpha} \\left( \\frac{x^{-\\alpha}}{-\\alpha} - \\frac{x_{\\min}^{-\\alpha}}{-\\alpha} \\right) = -x_{\\min}^{\\alpha} (x^{-\\alpha} - x_{\\min}^{-\\alpha})$$\n$$F(x) = -x_{\\min}^{\\alpha} x^{-\\alpha} + x_{\\min}^{\\alpha} x_{\\min}^{-\\alpha} = - \\left(\\frac{x_{\\min}}{x}\\right)^{\\alpha} + 1$$\nSo, the cumulative distribution function for $x \\ge x_{\\min}$ is:\n$$F(x) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{x_{\\min}}{x}\\right)^{\\alpha}$$\nFor $x  x_{\\min}$, $F(x) = 0$.\n\nNext, we find the median, $m$. By definition, the median is the value of $x$ for which $F(x) = \\frac{1}{2}$. Since $\\alpha  0$ and $x_{\\min}  0$, the CDF is strictly increasing from $F(x_{\\min}) = 0$ to $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} F(x) = 1$, so a unique median exists and is greater than $x_{\\min}$. We set $F(m) = \\frac{1}{2}$:\n$$1 - \\left(\\frac{x_{\\min}}{m}\\right)^{\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nRearranging the terms to solve for $m$:\n$$\\left(\\frac{x_{\\min}}{m}\\right)^{\\alpha} = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nTaking the $\\alpha$-th root of both sides:\n$$\\frac{x_{\\min}}{m} = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{1/\\alpha} = 2^{-1/\\alpha}$$\nSolving for $m$:\n$$m = \\frac{x_{\\min}}{2^{-1/\\alpha}} = x_{\\min} 2^{1/\\alpha}$$\n\nNow, we compute the mean, $\\mu$, of the distribution. The mean is the expected value of the random variable $X$, defined by $\\mu = E[X] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x f(x) dx$. The problem states that we assume $\\alpha  1$, which is the condition required for the mean to be finite.\n$$\\mu = \\int_{x_{\\min}}^{\\infty} x \\left( \\alpha x_{\\min}^{\\alpha} x^{-(\\alpha+1)} \\right) dx$$\nCombining the terms involving $x$:\n$$\\mu = \\alpha x_{\\min}^{\\alpha} \\int_{x_{\\min}}^{\\infty} x \\cdot x^{-(\\alpha+1)} dx = \\alpha x_{\\min}^{\\alpha} \\int_{x_{\\min}}^{\\infty} x^{-\\alpha} dx$$\nWe integrate $x^{-\\alpha}$:\n$$\\mu = \\alpha x_{\\min}^{\\alpha} \\left[ \\frac{x^{-\\alpha+1}}{-\\alpha+1} \\right]_{x_{\\min}}^{\\infty}$$\nThe upper limit requires evaluating $\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} x^{1-\\alpha}$. Since we assumed $\\alpha  1$, the exponent $(1-\\alpha)$ is negative, so this limit is $0$.\n$$\\mu = \\frac{\\alpha x_{\\min}^{\\alpha}}{1-\\alpha} \\left( 0 - x_{\\min}^{1-\\alpha} \\right) = \\frac{\\alpha x_{\\min}^{\\alpha}}{-(\\alpha-1)} (-x_{\\min}^{1-\\alpha})$$\n$$\\mu = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha-1} x_{\\min}^{\\alpha} x_{\\min}^{1-\\alpha} = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha-1} x_{\\min}^{\\alpha+1-\\alpha}$$\nThis simplifies to the expression for the mean:\n$$\\mu = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha-1} x_{\\min}$$\n\nFinally, we find the ratio of the mean to the median, $\\mu/m$.\n$$\\frac{\\mu}{m} = \\frac{\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha-1} x_{\\min}}{x_{\\min} 2^{1/\\alpha}}$$\nThe parameter $x_{\\min}$ cancels out, yielding the final expression as a function of $\\alpha$ only:\n$$\\frac{\\mu}{m} = \\frac{\\alpha}{(\\alpha-1) 2^{1/\\alpha}}$$\n\nFor $\\alpha  1$, the ratio $\\mu/m$ is always greater than $1$, confirming the right-skewness of the distribution where the mean is pulled above the median by the heavy right tail.",

If you provide more than one expression, list them in a single row as a matrix. Do not include any units in your final expressions.",
            "solution": "### Derivation of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE)\n\nThe derivation proceeds by first finding the probability density function (PDF) from the given survival function, then constructing the log-likelihood function for the sample, and finally maximizing this function with respect to the parameter $\\alpha$.\n\n1.  **Probability Density Function (PDF):**\n    The cumulative distribution function (CDF) is $F(x) = P(X \\leq x) = 1 - P(X  x)$. Since the distribution is continuous, $P(Xx) = P(X\\geq x)$. Thus, for $x \\geq x_{\\min}$, the CDF is:\n    $$F(x; \\alpha) = 1 - S(x) = 1 - \\left(\\frac{x_{\\min}}{x}\\right)^{\\alpha}$$\n    The PDF, $p(x; \\alpha)$, is the derivative of the CDF with respect to $x$:\n    $$p(x; \\alpha) = \\frac{d}{dx} F(x; \\alpha) = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left(1 - x_{\\min}^{\\alpha}x^{-\\alpha}\\right) = -x_{\\min}^{\\alpha} (-\\alpha) x^{-\\alpha-1}$$\n    This simplifies to the PDF for the Pareto Type I distribution:\n    $$p(x; \\alpha) = \\frac{\\alpha x_{\\min}^{\\alpha}}{x^{\\alpha+1}} \\quad \\text{for } x \\geq x_{\\min}$$\n\n2.  **Likelihood and Log-Likelihood Functions:**\n    Given an i.i.d. sample $\\{x_{i}\\}_{i=1}^{n}$, the likelihood function $L(\\alpha; \\{x_i\\})$ is the joint probability of observing the data:\n    $$L(\\alpha; \\{x_i\\}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} p(x_i; \\alpha) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\alpha x_{\\min}^{\\alpha}}{x_i^{\\alpha+1}}$$\n    To simplify maximization, we work with the log-likelihood function, $\\ell(\\alpha) = \\ln(L(\\alpha))$:\n    $$\\ell(\\alpha; \\{x_i\\}) = \\ln\\left( \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{\\alpha x_{\\min}^{\\alpha}}{x_i^{\\alpha+1}} \\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ln\\left( \\frac{\\alpha x_{\\min}^{\\alpha}}{x_i^{\\alpha+1}} \\right)$$\n    $$\\ell(\\alpha) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left[ \\ln(\\alpha) + \\alpha \\ln(x_{\\min}) - (\\alpha+1) \\ln(x_i) \\right]$$\n    $$\\ell(\\alpha) = n \\ln(\\alpha) + n\\alpha \\ln(x_{\\min}) - (\\alpha+1) \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ln(x_i)$$\n\n3.  **Maximization:**\n    To find the MLE, $\\hat{\\alpha}_{ML}$, we differentiate $\\ell(\\alpha)$ with respect to $\\alpha$ and set the result to zero (the first-order condition):\n    $$\\frac{d\\ell}{d\\alpha} = \\frac{n}{\\alpha} + n \\ln(x_{\\min}) - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ln(x_i) = 0$$\n    Solving for $\\alpha$ gives the estimator $\\hat{\\alpha}_{ML}$:\n    $$\\frac{n}{\\hat{\\alpha}_{ML}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ln(x_i) - n \\ln(x_{\\min}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( \\ln(x_i) - \\ln(x_{\\min}) \\right)$$\n    $$\\frac{n}{\\hat{\\alpha}_{ML}} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ln\\left(\\frac{x_i}{x_{\\min}}\\right)$$\n    Thus, the closed-form MLE for $\\alpha$ is:\n    $$\\hat{\\alpha}_{ML} = \\frac{n}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ln\\left(\\frac{x_i}{x_{\\min}}\\right)}$$\n    To confirm this is a maximum, we check the second derivative:\n    $$\\frac{d^2\\ell}{d\\alpha^2} = -\\frac{n}{\\alpha^2}$$\n    Since $n0$ and $\\alpha^20$, the second derivative is always negative, confirming the log-likelihood function is concave and the stationary point is a global maximum.\n\n### Derivation of the Asymptotic Variance\n\nThe asymptotic variance of an MLE is given by the inverse of the Fisher information.\n\n1.  **Fisher Information:**\n    The Fisher information $I(\\alpha)$ for a sample of size $n$ is $n$ times the Fisher information for a single observation, $I_1(\\alpha)$. For a single parameter, $I_1(\\alpha)$ can be calculated as:\n    $$I_1(\\alpha) = -E\\left[ \\frac{d^2}{d\\alpha^2} \\ln(p(x; \\alpha)) \\right]$$\n    From our earlier work, the log-PDF for a single observation is $\\ln(p(x; \\alpha)) = \\ln(\\alpha) + \\alpha \\ln(x_{\\min}) - (\\alpha+1) \\ln(x)$.\n    The second derivative with respect to $\\alpha$ is:\n    $$\\frac{d^2}{d\\alpha^2} \\ln(p(x; \\alpha)) = \\frac{d}{d\\alpha} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\alpha} + \\ln(x_{\\min}) - \\ln(x)\\right) = -\\frac{1}{\\alpha^2}$$\n    Since this expression does not depend on the random variable $x$, its expectation is the expression itself:\n    $$E\\left[ \\frac{d^2}{d\\alpha^2} \\ln(p(x; \\alpha)) \\right] = -\\frac{1}{\\alpha^2}$$\n    Therefore, the Fisher information for a single observation is:\n    $$I_1(\\alpha) = - \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\alpha^2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha^2}$$\n    The total Fisher information for the sample of size $n$ is:\n    $$I(\\alpha) = n I_1(\\alpha) = \\frac{n}{\\alpha^2}$$\n\n2.  **Asymptotic Variance:**\n    Under standard regularity conditions, the MLE $\\hat{\\alpha}_{ML}$ is asymptotically normally distributed with a variance equal to the Cramér-Rao Lower Bound, which is the inverse of the Fisher information.\n    $$\\text{Var}(\\hat{\\alpha}_{ML}) \\approx [I(\\alpha)]^{-1} = \\frac{\\alpha^2}{n}$$\n    This is the theoretical asymptotic variance of the estimator, which depends on the true unknown parameter $\\alpha$. A consistent estimator for the asymptotic variance is obtained by substituting the MLE $\\hat{\\alpha}_{ML}$ for the true parameter $\\alpha$:\n    $$\\widehat{\\text{Var}}(\\hat{\\alpha}_{ML}) = \\frac{\\hat{\\alpha}_{ML}^2}{n} = \\frac{1}{n} \\left( \\frac{n}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ln\\left(\\frac{x_i}{x_{\\min}}\\right)} \\right)^2 = \\frac{n}{\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\ln\\left(\\frac{x_i}{x_{\\min}}\\right) \\right)^2}$$\n    This expression provides the estimated asymptotic variance based on the sample data.\n\nThe two required expressions are the estimator $\\hat{\\alpha}_{ML}$ and its estimated asymptotic variance.",
