The initial lattice connects each node to its $k$ nearest neighbors, with $k$ even, meaning each node connects to $k/2$ neighbors clockwise and $k/2$ neighbors counterclockwise along the ring. The network is undirected. Use the following foundational facts: (i) the handshake lemma in graph theory, which states that the sum of degrees in an undirected graph equals $2M$, where $M$ is the number of undirected edges; and (ii) modular arithmetic on the node index set, where for any integer $a$, the residue $a \\bmod N$ is defined as the unique integer $r \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,N-1\\}$ satisfying $a \\equiv r \\pmod{N}$.\n\nFor the specific parameter values $N=1000$ and $k=10$, do the following:\n\n1.

It is scientifically grounded in network theory, well-posed with all necessary parameters provided, and objectively stated. The problem requires the application of fundamental definitions and the handshake lemma to a specific instance of the Watts-Strogatz model.\n\nThe problem is addressed in two parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Determination of the total number of edges, $M$.\n\nThe initial lattice is a regular ring lattice where each node is connected to its $k$ nearest neighbors. By definition, this means that every node in the graph has the same degree, which is equal to $k$. Such a graph is known as a $k$-regular graph.\n\nWe are given the following parameters:\n- The total number of nodes, $N = 1000$.\n- The degree of each node, $k = 10$.\n\nThe handshake lemma states that for any undirected graph with $M$ edges, the sum of the degrees of all its vertices is equal to twice the number of edges. This is expressed as:\n$$ \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \\text{deg}(v_i) = 2M $$\nwhere $\\text{deg}(v_i)$ is the degree of node $v_i$.\n\nIn our $k$-regular graph of $N$ nodes, the degree of every node is $k$. Therefore, the sum of the degrees is the number of nodes multiplied by the degree of each node:\n$$ \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \\text{deg}(v_i) = N \\times k $$\n\nBy equating the two expressions for the sum of degrees, we obtain:\n$$ Nk = 2M $$\n\nWe can solve for $M$, the total number of edges:\n$$ M = \\frac{Nk}{2} $$\n\nSubstituting the given values $N = 1000$ and $k = 10$ into this equation:\n$$ M = \\frac{1000 \\times 10}{2} = \\frac{10000}{2} = 5000 $$\nThus, the initial lattice has $M = 5000$ undirected edges.\n\nPart 2: Determination of the neighbors of node $i=7$.\n\nThe model specifies that each node $i$ is connected to its $k$ nearest neighbors, with $k/2$ neighbors on each side (clockwise and counterclockwise) on the ring. The node indices are in the set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, N-1\\}$, and connections are defined using modular arithmetic.\n\nA neighbor of node $i$ is any node with an index $j$ such that the ring distance $|i-j| \\pmod{N}$ is between $1$ and $k/2$. More formally, node $i$ is connected to nodes with indices $(i \\pm d) \\bmod N$, where $d \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, k/2\\}$.\n\nWe are given the parameters:\n- The specific node index, $i = 7$.\n- The total number of nodes, $N = 1000$.\n- The degree, $k = 10$, which implies $k/2 = 5$.\n\nThe neighbors of node $i=7$ are the nodes with indices $(7 \\pm d) \\bmod 1000$ for $d \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$.\n\nLet's list the \"counterclockwise\" neighbors (indices $7-d$):\n- For $d=1$: $(7-1) \\bmod 1000 = 6 \\bmod 1000 = 6$\n- For $d=2$: $(7-2) \\bmod 1000 = 5 \\bmod 1000 = 5$\n- For $d=3$: $(7-3) \\bmod 1000 = 4 \\bmod 1000 = 4$\n- For $d=4$: $(7-4) \\bmod 1000 = 3 \\bmod 1000 = 3$\n- For $d=5$: $(7-5) \\bmod 1000 = 2 \\bmod 1000 = 2$\n\nNow let's list the \"clockwise\" neighbors (indices $7+d$):\n- For $d=1$: $(7+1) \\bmod 1000 = 8 \\bmod 1000 = 8$\n- For $d=2$: $(7+2) \\bmod 1000 = 9 \\bmod 1000 = 9$\n- For $d=3$: $(7+3) \\bmod 1000 = 10 \\bmod 1000 = 10$\n- For $d=4$: $(7+4) \\bmod 1000 = 11 \\bmod 1000 = 11$\n- For $d=5$: $(7+5) \\bmod 1000 = 12 \\bmod 1000 = 12$\n\nIn this specific case, for $i=7$, all resulting neighbor indices are positive and less than $N=1000$, so the modulo operation does not alter the values.\n\nCombining and sorting the indices of the $k=10$ neighbors of node $i=7$, we get the set:\n$\\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\\}$.\n\nThe final answer requires both the value of $M$ and this list of indices to be presented as a single row matrix.",

            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in network science, well-posed, and objective. It contains a complete and consistent setup for analyzing the Watts-Strogatz model.\n\nThe solution is presented in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Clustering Coefficient for the Regular Ring, $C(0)$\n\nThe global clustering coefficient $C$ is the average of the local clustering coefficients $C_i$ over all nodes $i$. For the initial regular ring lattice, all nodes are equivalent due to symmetry, so $C(0)$ is equal to $C_i$ for any node $i$. The local clustering coefficient at node $i$ is defined as:\n$$\nC_i = \\frac{\\text{number of connected pairs among the neighbors of } i}{\\binom{k}{2}}\n$$\nLet's choose an arbitrary node, labeled $0$ for convenience. Its neighbors are the nodes at distances $1, 2, \\dots, k/2$ on either side. In a large ring ($N \\gg k$), we can represent the neighbors of node $0$ as the set $N(0) = \\{\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\dots, \\pm k/2\\}$. The degree of node $0$ is $k$. The total number of pairs of neighbors is $\\binom{k}{2}$.\n\nWe need to calculate the number of edges, let's call it $E_0$, in the subgraph induced by $N(0)$. An edge exists between two neighbors $u, v \\in N(0)$ if their distance on the ring is at most $k/2$. Assuming $N \\gg k$, the distance between two nodes $u$ and $v$ is simply $|u-v|$. So, two neighbors $u, v \\in N(0)$ are connected if $|u-v| \\le k/2$.\n\nLet's count the pairs $\\{u, v\\} \\subset N(0)$ that satisfy this condition. We can partition the pairs based on the signs of $u$ and $v$.\n1.  **Both neighbors are on the same side (e.g., positive).**\n    Let $u, v \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, k/2\\}$ with $u \\ne v$. The distance between them is $|u-v|$. Since the maximum possible distance is $(k/2) - 1$, which is less than $k/2$, all such pairs are connected. The number of such pairs is the number of ways to choose $2$ nodes from the $k/2$ neighbors on one side, which is $\\binom{k/2}{2}$. By symmetry, the same applies to the $k/2$ neighbors on the other side, contributing another $\\binom{k/2}{2}$ edges.\n    Total from this case: $2 \\binom{k/2}{2} = 2 \\frac{(k/2)(k/2 - 1)}{2} = \\frac{k}{2} (\\frac{k-2}{2}) = \\frac{k(k-2)}{4}$.\n\n2.  **Neighbors are on opposite sides.**\n    Let $u \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, k/2\\}$ and $v \\in \\{-1, -2, \\dots, -k/2\\}$. The distance is $|u-v| = u-v$. The condition for an edge is $u-v \\le k/2$. Let's write $v = -w$ where $w \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, k/2\\}$. The condition becomes $u+w \\le k/2$.\n    We can count these pairs by summing over one variable. For each $u \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, k/2\\}$, the possible values of $w$ are $1, 2, \\dots, k/2-u$. The number of such values for $w$ is $k/2-u$.\n    The total number of such edges is the sum over all possible values of $u$:\n    $$\n    \\sum_{u=1}^{k/2} (k/2 - u) = (k/2-1) + (k/2-2) + \\dots + (k/2 - (k/2-1)) + (k/2-k/2) = \\sum_{j=0}^{k/2-1} j = \\frac{(k/2-1)k/2}{2} = \\frac{k(k-2)}{8}\n    $$\n    This is correct.\n\nCombining the two cases, the total number of edges $E_0$ is:\n$$\nE_0 = \\frac{k(k-2)}{4} + \\frac{k(k-2)}{8} = \\frac{2k(k-2) + k(k-2)}{8} = \\frac{3k(k-2)}{8}\n$$\nNow we can compute $C(0)$:\n$$\nC(0) = C_0 = \\frac{E_0}{\\binom{k}{2}} = \\frac{3k(k-2)/8}{k(k-1)/2} = \\frac{3k(k-2)}{8} \\cdot \\frac{2}{k(k-1)} = \\frac{3(k-2)}{4(k-1)}\n$$\n\n### Part 2: Derivation of the Expected Clustering Coefficient $C(p)$\n\nThe rewiring process considers each of the $N \\cdot k/2$ edges in the lattice and, with probability $p$, replaces it with an edge to a new, randomly chosen node (avoiding self-loops and duplicates). This means each original edge survives with probability $1-p$.\n\nThe expected clustering coefficient $C(p)$ is the average expected local clustering coefficient, $\\mathbb{E}[C_i(p)]$.\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[C_i(p)] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\frac{\\text{number of triangles at } i}{\\binom{k}{2}} \\right] = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[\\text{number of triangles at } i]}{\\binom{k}{2}}\n$$\nA triangle involving node $i$ consists of three edges $(i,u), (i,v), (u,v)$, where $u,v \\in N(i)$. For such a triangle from the original lattice to survive the rewiring process, all three of its constituent edges must survive. The problem states to assume independence of rewiring events. Therefore, the probability that a specific triangle survives is $(1-p)^3$.\n\nThe initial number of triangles involving node $i$ is $E_0 = \\frac{3k(k-2)}{8}$. The expected number of these triangles that survive is:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[T_{i, \\text{surviving}}] = E_0 (1-p)^3\n$$\nThe problem also states to assume that the number of new triangles formed by rewired \"long-range\" edges is negligible. Thus, we can approximate the expected number of triangles at node $i$ after rewiring as just the expected number of surviving triangles:\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[T_i(p)] \\approx E_0 (1-p)^3\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the expected clustering coefficient:\n$$\nC(p) = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[T_i(p)]}{\\binom{k}{2}} \\approx \\frac{E_0 (1-p)^3}{\\binom{k}{2}} = \\left(\\frac{E_0}{\\binom{k}{2}}\\right) (1-p)^3 = C(0) (1-p)^3\n$$\n\n### Part 3: Derivation of the Clustering Coefficient for a Random Graph, $C_{\\text{rand}}$\n\nFor a baseline comparison, we consider an Erdős–Rényi random graph $G(N,q)$ with the same number of nodes $N$ and the same expected mean degree $k$. In an ER graph, each of the $\\binom{N}{2}$ possible edges exists with an independent probability $q$.\n\nThe expected degree of any node is $(N-1)q$. We equate this to $k$:\n$$\nk = (N-1)q \\implies q = \\frac{k}{N-1}\n$$\nThe problem instructs us to use the fact that for an ER graph, the expected clustering coefficient is equal to the link probability $q$. This is a standard result for sparse graphs, where $C_{ER} \\approx q$. The reasoning is that for any two neighbors of a node $i$, the edge connecting them exists with probability $q$, independently of their connections to $i$. Thus, the fraction of connected pairs among neighbors is, on average, $q$.\nTherefore,\n$$\nC_{\\text{rand}} = q = \\frac{k}{N-1}\n$$\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\n\nWe are given $N=2000$, $k=16$, and $p=0.05$. We round the results to four significant figures.\n\n1.  **$C(0)$**:\n    $$\n    C(0) = \\frac{3(16-2)}{4(16-1)} = \\frac{3 \\times 14}{4 \\times 15} = \\frac{42}{60} = 0.7\n    $$\n    To four significant figures, $C(0) = 0.7000$.\n\n2.  **$C(p)$**:\n    $$\n    C(p) = C(0) (1-p)^3 = 0.7000 \\times (1-0.05)^3 = 0.7000 \\times (0.95)^3 = 0.7000 \\times 0.857375 = 0.6001625\n    $$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, $C(p) \\approx 0.6002$.\n\n3.  **$C_{\\text{rand}}$**:\n    $$\n    C_{\\text{rand}} = \\frac{k}{N-1} = \\frac{16}{2000-1} = \\frac{16}{1999} \\approx 0.008004002...\n    $$\n    Rounding to four significant figures, $C_{\\text{rand}} \\approx 0.008004$.\n\nThe final results are $C(0)=0.7000$, $C(p)=0.6002$, and $C_{\\text{rand}}=0.008004$.",

Let $C(p)$ denote the global clustering coefficient at rewiring probability $p$, and let $C(0)$ denote the clustering coefficient of the initial ring lattice.

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the largest admissible rewiring probability, denoted by $p$, in the Watts-Strogatz small-world model, subject to a constraint on the global clustering coefficient, $C(p)$.\n\nThe given constraint is that the clustering coefficient must be at least a fraction $\\alpha$ of the clustering coefficient of the initial regular lattice, $C(0)$. This is expressed by the inequality:\n$$C(p) \\ge \\alpha C(0)$$\nWe are provided with the conditions $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$ and $C(0) > 0$. The rewiring probability must satisfy $p \\in [0,1]$.\n\nThe problem states that for the purpose of this analysis, we are to use the following well-tested approximation for the clustering coefficient as a function of the rewiring probability:\n$$C(p) \\approx C(0) (1 - p)^{3}$$\nThis approximation is valid under the assumption that the rewiring process predominantly destroys existing triangles from the original lattice, and the formation of new triangles is negligible.\n\nTo find the admissible range for $p$, we substitute the approximation for $C(p)$ into the constraint inequality:\n$$C(0) (1 - p)^{3} \\ge \\alpha C(0)$$\nIt is given that $C(0) > 0$. This condition is physically sound for a Watts-Strogatz initial lattice with degree $k \\ge 4$, which is necessary for triangles to exist. Since $C(0)$ is a positive constant, we can divide both sides of the inequality by $C(0)$ without changing the direction of the inequality sign:\n$$(1 - p)^{3} \\ge \\alpha$$\nOur goal is to solve this inequality for $p$. The cube root function, $x \\mapsto x^{\\frac{1}{3}}$, is a monotonically increasing function over the real numbers. Applying this function to both sides of the inequality preserves the inequality's direction:\n$$\\left( (1 - p)^{3} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}} \\ge \\alpha^{\\frac{1}{3}}$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$1 - p \\ge \\alpha^{\\frac{1}{3}}$$\nTo isolate $p$, we rearrange the terms. Subtracting $1$ from both sides yields:\n$$-p \\ge \\alpha^{\\frac{1}{3}} - 1$$\nNext, we multiply both sides by $-1$. This operation reverses the direction of the inequality sign:\n$$p \\le 1 - \\alpha^{\\frac{1}{3}}$$\nThis inequality gives us the upper bound for the rewiring probability $p$. The problem asks for the largest admissible value of $p$ that guarantees the clustering constraint is met. This value is the upper limit of the derived range, provided it is consistent with the given domain $p \\in [0,1]$.\n\nWe must check the consistency of this result with the given constraints on $\\alpha$. We are given that $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$, which means $0 < \\alpha < 1$.\nSince the cube root function is strictly increasing and $\\sqrt[3]{0} = 0$ and $\\sqrt[3]{1} = 1$, it follows that if $0 < \\alpha < 1$, then $0 < \\alpha^{\\frac{1}{3}} < 1$.\nLet's analyze the expression for the upper bound on $p$: $1 - \\alpha^{\\frac{1}{3}}$.\nSince $0 < \\alpha^{\\frac{1}{3}} < 1$, multiplying by $-1$ gives $-1 < -\\alpha^{\\frac{1}{3}} < 0$.\nAdding $1$ to all parts of this inequality, we obtain $1 - 1 < 1 - \\alpha^{\\frac{1}{3}} < 1 - 0$, which simplifies to $0 < 1 - \\alpha^{\\frac{1}{3}} < 1$.\nThis confirms that the calculated upper bound for $p$ is a value between $0$ and $1$. The full interval of admissible probabilities is thus $0 \\le p \\le 1 - \\alpha^{\\frac{1}{3}}$. The function $C(p)$ is a decreasing function of $p$, so any $p$ in this interval will satisfy the constraint.\n\nThe largest admissible rewiring probability is therefore the maximum value in this interval, which is precisely the upper bound.\n$$p_{\\text{max}} = 1 - \\alpha^{\\frac{1}{3}}$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the largest admissible rewiring probability as a function of $\\alpha$.",
