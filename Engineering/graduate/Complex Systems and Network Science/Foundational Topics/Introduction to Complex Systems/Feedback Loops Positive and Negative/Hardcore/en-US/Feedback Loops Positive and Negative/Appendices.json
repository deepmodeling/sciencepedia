            "solution": "The problem asks for the e-folding time constant for the globally averaged surface temperature anomaly $T(t)$ in a zero-dimensional energy balance model.\n\nThe governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) is given as:\n$$\nC \\, \\frac{dT}{dt} = f(T) + H \\, T\n$$\nwhere $C$ is the effective heat capacity, $f(T)$ represents intrinsic climate feedbacks, and $H \\, T$ is an externally imposed linear feedback. The temperature anomaly $T$ is considered to be small, allowing for a linearization of the system around the equilibrium point $T=0$.\n\nFirst, we verify that $T=0$ is indeed an equilibrium (or fixed) point of the system. A fixed point $T^*$ satisfies $\\frac{dT}{dt} = 0$. Substituting $T=0$ into the right-hand side of the ODE, we get:\n$$\nf(0) + H \\cdot 0 = 0 + 0 = 0\n$$\nThis is because the problem states $f(0)=0$. Since the right-hand side is zero, $\\frac{dT}{dt}=0$, confirming that $T=0$ is a fixed point.\n\nThe problem states that a linearization about $T=0$ is appropriate. This involves approximating the function $f(T)$ with its first-order Taylor expansion around $T=0$:\n$$\nf(T) \\approx f(0) + f'(0)(T - 0)\n$$\nUsing the provided information that $f(0)=0$ and the definition of the baseline climate feedback parameter $f'(0) = -\\lambda_0$, the expansion becomes:\n$$\nf(T) \\approx 0 + (-\\lambda_0)T = -\\lambda_0 T\n$$\nSubstituting this linear approximation of $f(T)$ back into the governing ODE, we obtain the linearized equation for small $T$:\n$$\nC \\, \\frac{dT}{dt} = -\\lambda_0 T + H T\n$$\nThis can be rearranged by factoring out $T$ on the right-hand side:\n$$\nC \\, \\frac{dT}{dt} = (H - \\lambda_0) T\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{dt} = -\\frac{\\lambda_0 - H}{C} T\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation.
