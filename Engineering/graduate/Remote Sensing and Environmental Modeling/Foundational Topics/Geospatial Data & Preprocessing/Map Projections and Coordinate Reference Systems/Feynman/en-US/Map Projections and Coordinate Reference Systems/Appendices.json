            "solution": "The problem as stated is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of geodesy and cartography, specifically the definition of the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to derive a unique solution by applying the standard conventions of the UTM system, which are implicitly invoked by name.\n\nThe task is to determine the UTM zone number $Z$, the central meridian $\\lambda_{0}$, the false easting $\\mathrm{FE}$, and the false northing $\\mathrm{FN}$ for a point with geodetic coordinates longitude $\\lambda = -123.5^\\circ$ and latitude $\\phi = 49^\\circ$ on the WGS 84 ellipsoid.\n\nFirst, we determine the UTM zone number $Z$. The problem states that the globe is divided into $60$ zones, each spanning $6^\\circ$ of longitude, numbered $1$ to $60$ eastward from the anti-meridian ($\\lambda = -180^\\circ$). The zone number for a given longitude $\\lambda$ can be calculated by shifting the longitude origin from the Prime Meridian ($0^\\circ$) to the anti-meridian ($-180^\\circ$), dividing by the zone width ($6^\\circ$), and taking the ceiling of the result. This mathematical relationship is expressed as:\n$$Z = \\left\\lceil \\frac{\\lambda - (-180^\\circ)}{6^\\circ} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil \\frac{\\lambda + 180^\\circ}{6^\\circ} \\right\\rceil$$\nSubstituting the given longitude $\\lambda = -123.5^\\circ$:\n$$Z = \\left\\lceil \\frac{-123.5 + 180}{6} \\right\\rceil = \\left\\lceil \\frac{56.5}{6} \\right\\rceil = \\lceil 9.4166\\ldots \\rceil = 10$$\nThus, the point lies within UTM Zone $10$.\n\nSecond, we determine the central meridian $\\lambda_{0}$ for Zone $10$. The problem states that the central meridian is the midpoint of its zone's $6^\\circ$ longitudinal span. The longitudinal span for any zone $Z$ is from longitude $-180^\\circ + (Z-1) \\times 6^\\circ$ to $-180^\\circ + Z \\times 6^\\circ$. For Zone $10$, the western boundary is $-180^\\circ + (10-1) \\times 6^\\circ = -126^\\circ$ and the eastern boundary is $-180^\\circ + 10 \\times 6^\\circ = -120^\\circ$. The central meridian is the average of these boundaries:\n$$\\lambda_{0} = \\frac{-126^\\circ + (-120^\\circ)}{2} = \\frac{-246^\\circ}{2} = -123^\\circ$$\nAlternatively, the central meridian for zone $Z$ can be calculated directly using the formula:\n$$\\lambda_{0} = (Z \\times 6^\\circ) - 183^\\circ$$\nFor $Z=10$:\n$$\\lambda_{0} = (10 \\times 6^\\circ) - 183^\\circ = 60^\\circ - 183^\\circ = -123^\\circ$$\nThe central meridian for Zone $10$ is $\\lambda_{0} = -123^\\circ$.\n\nThird, we determine the false easting $\\mathrm{FE}$ and false northing $\\mathrm{FN}$. These are conventional offsets used in the UTM system to ensure all projected coordinates are positive.\nThe false easting, $\\mathrm{FE}$, is a constant value applied to the easting coordinate relative to the central meridian. The central meridian of any UTM zone is assigned a false easting of $500,000$ meters to prevent negative easting values within the zone. Therefore:\n$$\\mathrm{FE} = 500,000 \\, \\text{meters}$$\nThe false northing, $\\mathrm{FN}$, is dependent on the hemisphere. For locations in the Northern Hemisphere (latitude $\\phi > 0^\\circ$), the equator is the origin for northing, with a value of $0$ meters. Since all northings are positive, no offset is needed. For locations in the Southern Hemisphere (latitude $\\phi < 0^\\circ$), the equator is assigned a value of $10,000,000$ meters to prevent negative northing values. The given point has a latitude of $\\phi = 49^\\circ$, which is in the Northern Hemisphere. Therefore, the false northing is:\n$$\\mathrm{FN} = 0 \\, \\text{meters}$$\n\nIn summary, the determined parameters for the given point are:\n- UTM Zone Number $Z = 10$\n- Central Meridian $\\lambda_{0} = -123^\\circ$\n- False Easting $\\mathrm{FE} = 500,000$ meters\n- False Northing $\\mathrm{FN} = 0$ meters\n\nThese four values constitute the final answer, which is to be presented as a row matrix.",

It is well-posed, providing sufficient conditions (spherical metric, cylindrical mapping form, conformality, and a normalization condition) to uniquely determine the scale factor. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. The inclusion of the radius $R$ is noted, but its eventual irrelevance to the dimensionless scale factor does not invalidate the problem.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe objective is to derive the point scale factor $k(\\phi)$ for a cylindrical conformal projection with true scale at the equator, using a spherical Earth model.\n\nThe infinitesimal element of length on the surface of the sphere, $ds$, is given by the first fundamental form:\n$$ds^{2}=R^{2}d\\phi^{2} + R^{2}\\cos^{2}\\!\\phi\\,d\\lambda^{2}$$\nwhere $R$ is the radius of the sphere, $\\phi$ is the latitude, and $\\lambda$ is the longitude.\n\nThe projection maps the spherical surface onto a planar map with Cartesian coordinates $(x, y)$. For a cylindrical projection, the mapping functions have the form $x=f(\\lambda)$ and $y=g(\\phi)$. The infinitesimal element of length on the map, $ds_{map}$, is given by the Euclidean metric in the plane:\n$$ds_{map}^{2} = dx^{2} + dy^{2}$$\n\nUsing the chain rule, we can express $dx$ and $dy$ in terms of $d\\lambda$ and $d\\phi$:\n$$dx = \\frac{df}{d\\lambda}d\\lambda = f'(\\lambda)d\\lambda$$\n$$dy = \\frac{dg}{d\\phi}d\\phi = g'(\\phi)d\\phi$$\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the map metric gives:\n$$ds_{map}^{2} = (g'(\\phi))^{2}d\\phi^{2} + (f'(\\lambda))^{2}d\\lambda^{2}$$\n\nThe point scale factor, $k$, is defined by the relation $ds_{map} = k \\cdot ds$, which implies $ds_{map}^{2} = k^{2}ds^{2}$. The problem states the projection is conformal, which means the scale at any given point is the same in all directions. Thus, the scale factor $k$ can be a function of position, i.e., $k=k(\\phi, \\lambda)$, but not of direction.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $ds^{2}$ and $ds_{map}^{2}$ into the scaled relationship:\n$$(g'(\\phi))^{2}d\\phi^{2} + (f'(\\lambda))^{2}d\\lambda^{2} = k^{2} \\left(R^{2}d\\phi^{2} + R^{2}\\cos^{2}\\!\\phi\\,d\\lambda^{2}\\right)$$\n$$(g'(\\phi))^{2}d\\phi^{2} + (f'(\\lambda))^{2}d\\lambda^{2} = k^{2}R^{2}d\\phi^{2} + k^{2}R^{2}\\cos^{2}\\!\\phi\\,d\\lambda^{2}$$\n\nFor this equality to hold for any independent infinitesimal displacements $d\\phi$ and $d\\lambda$, the coefficients of $d\\phi^{2}$ and $d\\lambda^{2}$ on both sides must be equal.\n\nEquating coefficients of $d\\phi^{2}$:\n$$(g'(\\phi))^{2} = k^{2}R^{2} \\implies |g'(\\phi)| = kR$$\nLet's assume latitude increases from south to north, so $g'(\\phi) > 0$. Thus, $g'(\\phi) = kR$. (Equation 1)\n\nEquating coefficients of $d\\lambda^{2}$:\n$$(f'(\\lambda))^{2} = k^{2}R^{2}\\cos^{2}\\!\\phi \\implies |f'(\\lambda)| = kR\\cos\\phi$$\nLet's assume longitude increases from west to east, so $f'(\\lambda) > 0$. Thus, $f'(\\lambda) = kR\\cos\\phi$. (Equation 2)\n\nFrom Equation 1, the left side, $g'(\\phi)$, depends only on $\\phi$. Therefore, the right side, $kR$, must also depend only on $\\phi$. As $R$ is a constant, this implies that the scale factor $k$ must be a function of latitude $\\phi$ only, i.e., $k=k(\\phi)$. This is consistent with the problem statement's notation $k(\\phi)$.\n\nNow consider Equation 2: $f'(\\lambda) = k(\\phi)R\\cos\\phi$. The left side of this equation, $f'(\\lambda)$, is a function of $\\lambda$ only, while the right side is a function of $\\phi$ only. The only way a function of $\\lambda$ can be equal to a function of $\\phi$ for all $\\lambda$ and $\\phi$ is if both are equal to a constant. Let this constant be $C_1$.\n$$f'(\\lambda) = C_1$$\n$$k(\\phi)R\\cos\\phi = C_1$$\n\nFrom the second relation, we can express the scale factor $k(\\phi)$:\n$$k(\\phi) = \\frac{C_1}{R\\cos\\phi}$$\nThis gives the functional form of the scale factor, up to a constant.\n\nTo determine the constant $C_1$, we use the condition that scale is true at the equator. This means that at $\\phi=0$, the scale factor $k(0)$ must be equal to $1$.\n$$k(0) = \\frac{C_1}{R\\cos(0)} = \\frac{C_1}{R \\cdot 1} = 1$$\nThis implies $C_1 = R$.\n\nSubstituting $C_1=R$ back into the expression for $k(\\phi)$:\n$$k(\\phi) = \\frac{R}{R\\cos\\phi} = \\frac{1}{\\cos\\phi} = \\sec\\phi$$\nThis is the derived expression for the point scale factor of the spherical Mercator projection with true scale at the equator. Note that the scale factor is dimensionless and independent of the Earth's radius $R$, as expected.\n\nWe can also determine the full projection equations. From $f'(\\lambda)=C_1=R$, we integrate to get $x = f(\\lambda) = R\\lambda + C_2$. Setting $x=0$ at $\\lambda=0$ gives $C_2=0$, so $x=R\\lambda$.\nFrom Equation 1, $g'(\\phi) = k(\\phi)R = (\\sec\\phi)R$. Integrating with respect to $\\phi$:\n$$y = g(\\phi) = \\int R\\sec\\phi \\,d\\phi = R \\ln|\\sec\\phi + \\tan\\phi| + C_3$$\nSetting $y=0$ at $\\phi=0$ gives $C_3=-R\\ln|\\sec(0)+\\tan(0)| = -R\\ln|1+0|=0$. So, $y=R\\ln(\\sec\\phi + \\tan\\phi)$. These are the standard equations for the spherical Mercator projection.\n\nThe final step is to evaluate $k(\\phi)=\\sec\\phi$ for the given latitudes.\n\n1.  Evaluation at $\\phi=45^{\\circ}$:\n    The cosine of $45^{\\circ}$ is $\\cos(45^{\\circ}) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$.\n    $$k(45^{\\circ}) = \\sec(45^{\\circ}) = \\frac{1}{\\cos(45^{\\circ})} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2}$$\n    The numerical value is $\\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.41421356...$.\n    Rounding to seven significant figures, we get $1.414214$.\n\n2.  Evaluation at $\\phi=60^{\\circ}$:\n    The cosine of $60^{\\circ}$ is $\\cos(60^{\\circ}) = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n    $$k(60^{\\circ}) = \\sec(60^{\\circ}) = \\frac{1}{\\cos(60^{\\circ})} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{2}} = 2$$\n    The value is exactly $2$. To express this to seven significant figures, we write $2.000000$.\n\nThe scale factor at $\\phi=45^{\\circ}$ is approximately $1.414214$, and at $\\phi=60^{\\circ}$ it is exactly $2.000000$.",

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed, resting on fundamental principles of geodesy and cartography, specifically the definition and application of the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem requires us to determine the UTM zone, the central meridian $\\lambda_0$, and the meridian convergence $\\gamma$ for a point with geodetic coordinates $(\\phi, \\lambda) = (60^{\\circ}, 3^{\\circ})$ on the WGS84 ellipsoid.\n\nFirst, we determine the UTM zone for the given longitude $\\lambda = 3^{\\circ}$. The UTM system divides the Earth into $60$ zones, each spanning $6^{\\circ}$ of longitude. The zone number, $Z$, for a given longitude $\\lambda$ (expressed in degrees, with east longitudes being positive) can be calculated using the formula:\n$$Z = \\lfloor \\frac{\\lambda}{6^{\\circ}} + 31 \\rfloor$$\nSubstituting the given longitude $\\lambda = 3^{\\circ}$:\n$$Z = \\lfloor \\frac{3}{6} + 31 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 0.5 + 31 \\rfloor = \\lfloor 31.5 \\rfloor = 31$$\nThus, the point is located in UTM Zone $31$.\n\nNext, we identify the central meridian, $\\lambda_0$, for this zone. The central meridian of any UTM zone $Z$ is defined by the formula:\n$$\\lambda_0 = (Z - 31) \\times 6^{\\circ} + 3^{\\circ}$$\nSubstituting $Z = 31$:\n$$\\lambda_0 = (31 - 31) \\times 6^{\\circ} + 3^{\\circ} = 0 \\times 6^{\\circ} + 3^{\\circ} = 3^{\\circ}$$\nThe central meridian for UTM Zone $31$ is longitude $3^{\\circ}$ East.\n\nNow, we compute the meridian convergence, $\\gamma$. Meridian convergence is the angle at a specific point between the direction of true north (along the geodetic meridian) and grid north (the direction parallel to the central meridian of the map projection). For the Transverse Mercator projection, a very good approximation for $\\gamma$ is given by:\n$$\\gamma \\approx (\\lambda - \\lambda_0) \\sin(\\phi)$$\nwhere $(\\lambda - \\lambda_0)$ must be expressed in radians for the result $\\gamma$ to be in radians. More complex series expansions exist for higher accuracy, but all terms in these expansions contain powers of $(\\lambda - \\lambda_0)$.\n\nIn this specific case, the longitude of the point is $\\lambda = 3^{\\circ}$ and the longitude of the central meridian is $\\lambda_0 = 3^{\\circ}$. Therefore, the difference in longitude is:\n$$\\Delta\\lambda = \\lambda - \\lambda_0 = 3^{\\circ} - 3^{\\circ} = 0^{\\circ}$$\nSince the point lies exactly on the central meridian of its UTM zone, the longitude difference $\\Delta\\lambda$ is zero. Substituting this into the formula for convergence:\n$$\\gamma \\approx (0) \\sin(60^{\\circ}) = 0$$\nBecause the longitude difference is exactly zero, all terms in any series expansion for $\\gamma$ become zero. Thus, the meridian convergence is not an approximation but is exactly zero.\n$$\\gamma = 0 \\text{ radians}$$\nThis result is geometrically intuitive: on the central meridian of a Transverse Mercator projection, the meridian itself is the line that defines the \"up\" direction (grid north) for the entire projection grid. Therefore, true north and grid north are perfectly aligned, and the angle between them is zero.\n\nFinally, we are asked to explain the relationship between a geodetic azimuth $\\alpha$ (referenced to true north) and a UTM grid bearing $\\beta_{\\mathrm{grid}}$ (referenced to grid north). The meridian convergence $\\gamma$ is defined as the signed angle from true north to grid north, with $\\gamma > 0$ when grid north is east of true north.\n\nThe relationship is:\n$$\\text{Geodetic Azimuth} = \\text{Grid Bearing} + \\text{Meridian Convergence}$$\n$$\\alpha = \\beta_{\\mathrm{grid}} + \\gamma$$\nTo convert a known geodetic azimuth to a grid bearing, we rearrange the formula:\n$$\\beta_{\\mathrm{grid}} = \\alpha - \\gamma$$\nThis is the general rule. For a point east of the central meridian in the Northern Hemisphere, $\\lambda > \\lambda_0$, so $\\gamma > 0$, and the grid bearing is less than the geodetic azimuth. For a point west of the central meridian, $\\lambda < \\lambda_0$, so $\\gamma < 0$, and the grid bearing is greater than the geodetic azimuth.\n\nAt the specific location $(\\phi, \\lambda) = (60^{\\circ}, 3^{\\circ})$, we found that $\\gamma = 0$. Therefore, the specific rule that applies at this location is:\n$$\\beta_{\\mathrm{grid}} = \\alpha - 0 = \\alpha$$\nAt this point on the central meridian, the grid bearing is identical to the geodetic azimuth.",
