It invokes the Rayleigh criterion for diffraction-limited resolution, a standard concept in physics and engineering. The provided values for altitude ($H$), wavelength ($\\lambda$), and ground resolution ($\\rho$) are realistic and representative of modern high-resolution Earth observation systems.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a complete set of parameters and a clear physical model (diffraction-limited optics) to uniquely determine the required aperture diameter $D$.

The feasibility constraint $D_{\\max} = 0.85$ m is a realistic limitation for a non-deployable primary mirror on a contemporary satellite bus.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and internally consistent. It represents a standard, valid calculation in the field of optical system design for remote sensing. Therefore, the problem is **valid**, and a solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the derivation of the minimum aperture diameter $D$ that can achieve a specified ground resolvable distance $\\rho$. This involves two steps: relating the angular resolution to the aperture diameter via diffraction theory, and then relating the angular resolution to the ground resolvable distance via geometry.\n\nFirst, we consider the fundamental limit on resolution imposed by the wave nature of light, known as diffraction. For a circular, unobscured aperture of diameter $D$, scalar diffraction theory gives the minimum resolvable angular separation, $\\theta_{res}$, according to the Rayleigh criterion. This criterion states that two point sources are just resolvable when the center of the Airy disk (the diffraction pattern of a point source) of one source is directly over the first minimum of the Airy disk of the other. This angular separation is given by:\n$$\n\\theta_{res} = 1.22 \\frac{\\lambda}{D}\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of light and the angle $\\theta_{res}$ is in radians. The factor of $1.22$ arises from the first zero of the first-order Bessel function of the first kind, $J_1(x)$, which describes the amplitude of the diffraction pattern.\n\nSecond, we project this angular resolution onto the ground. The satellite is at an altitude $H$ and is viewing at nadir (directly below). The ground resolvable distance $\\rho$ is the physical separation on the Earth's surface corresponding to the angular separation $\\theta_{res}$. Using trigonometry for a right triangle formed by the satellite, the sub-satellite point, and a resolved point on the ground, we have:\n$$\n\\tan(\\theta_{res}) = \\frac{\\rho}{H}\n$$\nThe problem states to use the small-angle approximation. Since the altitude $H$ is many orders of magnitude larger than the ground resolution $\\rho$ ($700 \\text{ km} \\gg 0.5 \\text{ m}$), the angle $\\theta_{res}$ is extremely small. For small angles expressed in radians, $\\tan(\\theta_{res}) \\approx \\theta_{res}$. Thus, we can write:\n$$\n\\theta_{res} \\approx \\frac{\\rho}{H}\n$$\nNow, we equate the two expressions for $\\theta_{res}$ to connect the system's physical parameters to the required performance:\n$$\n1.22 \\frac{\\lambda}{D} = \\frac{\\rho}{H}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the minimum clear-aperture diameter $D$ required to meet the specification. We rearrange the equation to solve for $D$:\n$$\nD = 1.22 \\frac{H \\lambda}{\\rho}\n$$\nThis is the symbolic expression for the required aperture diameter.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $D$ using the provided data. It is critical to ensure all units are consistent. We will convert all length measurements to meters.\n- $H = 700 \\text{ km} = 700 \\times 10^3 \\text{ m} = 7 \\times 10^5 \\text{ m}$\n- $\\lambda = 550 \\text{ nm} = 550 \\times 10^{-9} \\text{ m} = 5.5 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}$\n- $\\rho = 0.5 \\text{ m}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $D$:\n$$\nD = 1.22 \\times \\frac{(7 \\times 10^5 \\text{ m}) \\times (5.5 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m})}{0.5 \\text{ m}}\n$$\n$$\nD = 1.22 \\times \\frac{7 \\times 5.5 \\times 10^{-2}}{0.5} \\text{ m}\n$$\n$$\nD = 1.22 \\times \\frac{38.5 \\times 10^{-2}}{0.5} \\text{ m}\n$$\n$$\nD = 1.22 \\times (77 \\times 10^{-2}) \\text{ m}\n$$\n$$\nD = 0.9394 \\text{ m}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\nD \\approx 0.939 \\text{ m}\n$$\n\nFinally, a brief discussion on feasibility. The calculated required minimum diameter is $D \\approx 0.939$ m. The spacecraft bus can accommodate a monolithic primary mirror of at most $D_{\\max} = 0.85$ m. Since $D > D_{\\max}$ ($0.939 \\text{ m} > 0.85 \\text{ m}$), the stated imaging performance goal is **not feasible** under the given platform constraint for a monolithic mirror.\n\nTo achieve feasibility, the required diameter $D$ would need to be reduced. Based on the formula $D = 1.22 \\frac{H \\lambda}{\\rho}$, this could be accomplished by:\n1.  Lowering the altitude $H$.\n2.  Observing at a shorter wavelength $\\lambda$.\n3.  Accepting a larger, coarser ground resolvable distance $\\rho$.\n\nThis calculation represents an idealized best case. The Rayleigh criterion defines the absolute diffraction limit. A real-world system's performance is described by its Modulation Transfer Function (MTF), which is degraded by factors such as optical aberrations, atmospheric turbulence, platform jitter, and detector limitations, all of which were assumed to be negligible. These factors effectively lower the contrast at high spatial frequencies, meaning that to achieve a true, robust resolution of $0.5$ m, an even larger aperture would be required than the one calculated. Furthermore, the Ground Sample Distance (GSD), the projection of a single detector pixel on the ground, must be fine enough (typically $GSD \\le \\rho/2$) to properly sample the detail resolved by the optics, posing additional constraints on the focal length and detector design. Thus, the infeasibility is even more pronounced than this simple calculation suggests. The only way to meet the goal with the bus constraint would be to use a deployable or segmented-mirror telescope, which adds significant complexity and cost.",

This practice shifts our focus from the physical resolution limit to the principles of digital sampling, governed by the Nyquist-Shannon theorem.

The along-track imaging chain is well-characterized by its end-to-end Modulation Transfer Function (MTF), which, after stabilization and motion-compensation, is empirically found to be effectively band-limited with a cutoff spatial frequency on the ground of $f_{c} = 1.1$ cycles per meter.

Your final numerical answer should be the single value of $s_{\\max}$, expressed in meters, rounded to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of signal processing and remote sensing, well-posed with a clear objective and sufficient information, and uses precise, objective language. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies.\n\nThe solution is developed in three parts as requested: derivation of the sampling condition, computation of the maximum ground sampling distance, and an explanation of the physical consequences of violating the sampling condition.\n\nFirst, we derive the condition on the ground sampling distance, $s$, that guarantees alias-free sampling. The derivation begins with the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem for a one-dimensional, real-valued, band-limited signal. The theorem states that for a signal whose Fourier transform is zero for all frequencies greater than or equal to a maximum frequency, $f_{\\max}$, it can be perfectly reconstructed from its samples if the sampling frequency, $f_s$, satisfies the condition:\n$$f_s > 2 f_{\\max}$$\nThe frequency $2 f_{\\max}$ is known as the Nyquist rate. In the context of this problem, the signal is the spatial variation of radiance along the ground in the along-track direction. The imaging system's end-to-end Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) acts as a low-pass filter on this spatial signal. The problem states that this system is effectively band-limited with a cutoff spatial frequency $f_c$. This cutoff frequency corresponds to the maximum frequency present in the image formed by the system. Therefore, we identify $f_{\\max}$ with $f_c$:\n$$f_{\\max} = f_c = 1.1 \\text{ cycles per meter}$$\nThe problem defines the ground sampling distance (GSD) as $s$ meters. This is the spacing between consecutive samples on the ground. The spatial sampling frequency, $f_s$, is the reciprocal of this sampling distance:\n$$f_s = \\frac{1}{s}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $f_{\\max}$ and $f_s$ into the Nyquist–Shannon condition, we obtain the condition for alias-free sampling in terms of the system parameters:\n$$\\frac{1}{s} > 2 f_c$$\nTo express this condition as a constraint on the ground sampling distance $s$, we rearrange the inequality. Since $s$ must be a positive distance, we can multiply both sides by $s$ and divide by $2 f_c$ without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$s  \\frac{1}{2 f_c}$$\nThis is the derived condition on $s$ that guarantees alias-free sampling of the band-limited image.\n\nSecond, we compute the maximum allowable GSD, denoted as $s_{\\max}$. This value represents the theoretical upper bound on $s$ for which the alias-free condition holds. It corresponds to the sampling rate exactly at the Nyquist rate, $f_s = 2f_c$. Thus, $s_{\\max}$ is the value that makes the previous inequality an equality:\n$$s_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{2 f_c}$$\nWe are given the cutoff spatial frequency $f_c = 1.1$ cycles per meter. Substituting this value into the expression for $s_{\\max}$:\n$$s_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 1.1} = \\frac{1}{2.2} \\text{ meters}$$\nPerforming the division yields:\n$$s_{\\max} \\approx 0.454545... \\text{ meters}$$\nThe problem requires this value to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$s_{\\max} \\approx 0.4545 \\text{ meters}$$\n\nThird, we explain the physical consequence of violating this bound (i.e., choosing a GSD $s > s_{\\max}$) for the detection of narrow linear features. This violation corresponds to undersampling ($f_s  2 f_c$). When a signal is undersampled, the phenomenon of aliasing occurs. Aliasing causes high-frequency components of the signal (frequencies above the Nyquist frequency, $f_s/2$) to be \"folded\" into the lower frequency range of the sampled spectrum, where they masquerade as lower-frequency signals that were not present in the original scene.\n\nNarrow linear features, such as levees and small bridges, are characterized by sharp edges, which contain significant high spatial frequency energy. When a GSD $s > s_{\\max}$ is used, the sampling frequency $f_s = 1/s$ is too low to capture these high frequencies faithfully. The aliased high-frequency energy corrupts the sampled data, leading to a loss of geometric fidelity. Specifically, for a linear feature observed in the along-track direction:\n1.  **Stair-stepping or Jaggedness:** A continuous, straight line can appear as a jagged, \"stair-stepped,\" or discontinuous line in the sampled image. The aliasing process introduces spurious low-frequency patterns that break the visual continuity of the feature.\n2.  **Disappearance and Reappearance (Intermittency):** Depending on the feature's orientation and width relative to the sampling grid, it may seem to break up into a series of dashes or even disappear entirely over short segments. This occurs because the aliasing can cause destructive interference with the feature's actual signal.\n3.  **Width Distortion:** The apparent width of the linear feature can be distorted, either appearing wider or narrower than it actually is.\nIn summary, violating the GSD bound by choosing $s > s_{\\max}$ makes it impossible to distinguish between a genuinely broken or jagged feature and a continuous straight feature that has been corrupted by aliasing. The geometric information is fundamentally altered, undermining the primary goal of faithfully detecting the geometry of these critical structures.",
