It is based on the fundamental relationship between frequency and wavelength ($c = f\\lambda$) and established principles of microwave remote sensing concerning wave interaction with natural media. The specified frequencies ($1.25\\ \\text{GHz}$ and $9.6\\ \\text{GHz}$) correspond to the widely used L-band and X-band, respectively, in SAR remote sensing.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed.

The qualitative part asks for an explanation based on established physical theory, not subjective opinion.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, objective language.\n- **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup:** The problem is self-contained. The calculation requires the speed of light in vacuum, $c$, a fundamental physical constant, which is standard to assume in such problems. There are no contradictions.\n- **Unrealistic or Infeasible:** The given frequencies and the described remote sensing scenario are entirely realistic and common in environmental science applications.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution is provided below.\n\nThe relationship between the frequency $f$ of an electromagnetic wave, its wavelength $\\lambda$, and its propagation speed in a given medium is a fundamental principle of physics. In free space (a vacuum), the propagation speed is the speed of light, denoted by the constant $c$. The relationship is given by:\n$$c = f\\lambda$$\nThe value of the speed of light in a vacuum is a defined constant, $c = 299,792,458 \\text{ m/s}$. To find the wavelength $\\lambda$ corresponding to a given frequency $f$, we rearrange the equation:\n$$\\lambda = \\frac{c}{f}$$\n\nFirst, we calculate the wavelength $\\lambda_1$ corresponding to the frequency $f_1 = 1.25\\ \\text{GHz} = 1.25 \\times 10^9\\ \\text{Hz}$.\n$$\\lambda_1 = \\frac{299,792,458\\ \\text{m/s}}{1.25 \\times 10^9\\ \\text{s}^{-1}} = 0.2398339664\\ \\text{m}$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, we get:\n$$\\lambda_1 \\approx 0.2398\\ \\text{m}$$\n\nNext, we calculate the wavelength $\\lambda_2$ corresponding to the frequency $f_2 = 9.6\\ \\text{GHz} = 9.6 \\times 10^9\\ \\text{Hz}$.\n$$\\lambda_2 = \\frac{299,792,458\\ \\text{m/s}}{9.6 \\times 10^9\\ \\text{s}^{-1}} = 0.03122838104\\ \\text{m}$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, we get:\n$$\\lambda_2 \\approx 0.03123\\ \\text{m}$$\n\nThe first wavelength, $\\lambda_1 \\approx 0.24\\ \\text{m}$, is in the L-band of the microwave spectrum, while the second, $\\lambda_2 \\approx 0.03\\ \\text{m}$, is in the X-band. Their significant difference in length, by a factor of approximately $8$, leads to markedly different interactions with the Earth's surface.\n\n**(i) Influence on Penetration into Vegetation and Moist Soils**\nThe penetration of an electromagnetic wave into a lossy medium is governed by attenuation, which is the absorption and scattering of the wave's energy. This is fundamentally related to the frequency of the wave and the complex dielectric constant of the medium, $\\epsilon = \\epsilon' - j\\epsilon''$. The imaginary part, $\\epsilon''$, is the loss factor and generally increases with frequency for natural media like water and vegetation. The penetration depth, $\\delta_p$, is the depth at which the power density of the wave has fallen to $1/e$ of its value at the surface. A greater attenuation implies a smaller penetration depth.\n\nFor vegetation canopies, which are a mixture of air and discrete dielectric elements (leaves, twigs, branches, trunks), the interaction mechanism is a combination of volume scattering and absorption.\n- The longer wavelength L-band wave ($\\lambda_1 \\approx 24\\ \\text{cm}$) is much larger than small vegetation elements like leaves and needles. It therefore experiences less volume scattering from the top of the canopy and can penetrate deeper, interacting with larger structural elements like branches and trunks, and often reaching the underlying soil surface.\n- The shorter wavelength X-band wave ($\\lambda_2 \\approx 3\\ \\text{cm}$) is comparable in size to many canopy elements such as leaves and small twigs. This leads to strong volume scattering in the upper layers of the canopy. The wave's energy is rapidly attenuated, and penetration to the ground is severely limited, especially in dense canopies. The backscattered signal is dominated by the crown of the vegetation.\n\nFor variably moist loamy soils, the dominant factor controlling dielectric properties is the volumetric water content. Liquid water has a high dielectric constant and significant dielectric loss that increases with frequency.\n- The L-band wave ($\\lambda_1$) experiences lower attenuation in moist soil compared to higher frequencies. It can therefore penetrate several centimeters into the soil, making it sensitive to soil moisture in the root zone. This makes L-band SAR a primary tool for soil moisture estimation.\n- The X-band wave ($\\lambda_2$) is much more strongly absorbed by water. Its penetration into moist soil is limited to the top few millimeters to a centimeter. Consequently, X-band SAR is only sensitive to the moisture content of the immediate soil surface and is heavily influenced by transient conditions like recent rainfall or dew.\n\n**(ii) Influence on Sensitivity to Surface Roughness**\nThe classification of a surface as electromagnetically \"smooth\" or \"rough\" depends on the ratio of the surface height variations to the incident wavelength. A key dimensionless parameter is derived from the Rayleigh criterion, which defines a surface as smooth if its standard deviation of height, $h$, satisfies $h < \\frac{\\lambda}{8 \\cos\\theta_i}$, where $\\theta_i$ is the incidence angle. The scattering regime is more formally controlled by the dimensionless parameter $k \\cdot s$, where $s$ is the root-mean-square (RMS) surface height and $k = 2\\pi/\\lambda$ is the electromagnetic wavenumber.\n- For a small $k \\cdot s$ (smooth surface), scattering is predominantly specular (mirror-like).\n- For a large $k \\cdot s$ (rough surface), scattering is predominantly diffuse (scattering in all directions).\n\n- For the long L-band wavelength ($\\lambda_1$), a surface must have relatively large height variations (many centimeters) to be considered rough ($k_1 \\cdot s$ is large). Surfaces with only millimeter-to-centimeter scale roughness appear electromagnetically smooth, producing primarily specular reflection. L-band is therefore less sensitive to small-scale roughness and more sensitive to larger-scale features such as tillage furrows or topography.\n- For the short X-band wavelength ($\\lambda_2$), the same surface appears much rougher because the ratio $\\frac{s}{\\lambda_2}$ is much larger than $\\frac{s}{\\lambda_1}$. Even small-scale roughness on the order of millimeters can make a surface appear very rough at X-band, leading to strong diffuse scattering. Thus, X-band is highly sensitive to fine-scale surface texture, micro-topography, and rock fragments. This sensitivity to roughness is a major confounding factor in retrieving other surface parameters (like soil moisture) from X-band data.",

The interface is locally planar at the scale of the wavelength. The wave is vertically polarized, meaning its electric field is parallel to the plane of incidence (parallel or $p$-polarization in classical optics terminology).

The plane of incidence is the $xz$-plane. A vertically polarized plane wave is incident from medium 1 onto the interface.

The wavenumbers are $k_1 = \\omega\\sqrt{\\mu_1\\epsilon_1}$ and $k_2 = \\omega\\sqrt{\\mu_2\\epsilon_2}$.\n\nThe boundary conditions at the interface $z=0$ require the tangential components of $\\vec{E}$ and $\\vec{H}$ to be continuous.\n1.

Under the small-perturbation model (SPM), which is valid for surfaces with roughness height variations small compared to the incident wavelength, the co-polarized backscatter coefficient $\\sigma^0_{vv}$ is given by:\n$$ \\sigma^0_{vv}(\\theta_i) \\propto |\\alpha_{vv}|^2 W(2k_1\\sin\\theta_i, 0) $$\nHere, $W$ is the power spectral density of the surface roughness, evaluated at the Bragg resonant spatial frequency $2k_1\\sin\\theta_i$. The term $\\alpha_{vv}$ is a polarization-dependent coefficient that incorporates the influence of the dielectric properties of the surface. This term is a function of the Fresnel reflection coefficient $r_v$ and the dielectric constant $\\epsilon'$.\n\nFrom first principles, the backscattered signal originates from the re-radiation of energy by electric currents induced on and within the surface by the incident electromagnetic field. The magnitude of these currents is proportional to the local electric field strength at the surface. This field is determined by the superposition of incident and reflected waves and is thus fundamentally governed by the dielectric contrast between the air and the soil. The Fresnel reflectivity $R_v$ is a direct measure of the power reflected due to this contrast.\n\nAs soil moisture increases, the real part of its relative permittivity, $\\epsilon'$, increases significantly (from $\\epsilon'=3$ to $\\epsilon'=15$ in this example). This results in a much larger dielectric contrast with air. As shown by the calculations, this increased contrast causes the Fresnel reflectivity $R_v$ to increase substantially. The term $|\\alpha_{vv}|^2$ in the SPM formulation for $\\sigma^0_{vv}$, while not identical to $R_v$, is strongly and positively correlated with it, as both are driven by the same dielectric contrast.\n\nTherefore, holding all other factors constant (surface roughness represented by $W$, and geometry represented by $\\theta_i$), an increase in Fresnel reflectivity $R_v$ due to higher soil moisture leads to a stronger interaction between the wave and the surface, inducing larger surface currents, which in turn produce a stronger backscattered signal. The large calculated ratio $R_{v,\\text{wet}}/R_{v,\\text{dry}} \\approx 8$ indicates a dramatic increase in reflected power and suggests a correspondingly significant increase in the backscattered radar cross section $\\sigma^0_{vv}$ when the soil transitions from dry to wet.",

Multiplying the RTE by the integrating factor gives:\n$$\n\\exp(\\tau') \\frac{d T_{b}}{d \\tau'} + \\exp(\\tau') T_{b} = T_{\\mathrm{atm}} \\exp(\\tau')\n$$\nThe left side is the derivative of a product:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{d \\tau'} \\left( T_{b} \\exp(\\tau') \\right) = T_{\\mathrm{atm}} \\exp(\\tau')\n$$\nIntegrating with respect to $\\tau'$ (since $T_{\\mathrm{atm}}$ is constant):\n$$\nT_{b}(\\tau') \\exp(\\tau') = T_{\\mathrmatm} \\exp(\\tau') + C\n$$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration. The general solution for the upwelling brightness temperature $T_b$ at any level $\\tau'$ is:\n$$\nT_{b}(\\tau') = T_{\\mathrmatm} + C \\exp(-\\tau')\n$$\nTo find the constant $C$, we must apply a boundary condition. The natural boundary is at the surface, $\\tau'=0$. The upwelling brightness temperature at the surface, $T_b(0)$, is the sum of the emission from the soil and the reflection of downwelling sky radiation.\n$$\nT_{b}(0) = \\epsilon T_{s} + (1-\\epsilon) T_{\\mathrm{sky,down}}(0)\n$$\nHere, $\\epsilon$ is the soil emissivity, $T_s$ is the soil physical temperature, and $T_{\\mathrm{sky,down}}(0)$ is the downwelling brightness temperature from the sky incident on the surface.\n\nTo find $T_{\\mathrm{sky,down}}(0)$, we must solve the RTE for downwelling radiation. Let's use an optical depth coordinate $\\tilde{\\tau}$ measured downwards from the top of the atmosphere, so $\\tilde{\\tau} = \\tau - \\tau'$. The RTE for downwelling brightness temperature $T_{b, \\text{down}}$ is $\\frac{d T_{b, \\text{down}}}{d \\tilde{\\tau}} = -T_{b, \\text{down}} + T_{\\mathrm{atm}}$. The general solution is $T_{b, \\text{down}}(\\tilde{\\tau}) = T_{\\mathrm{atm}} + K \\exp(-\\tilde{\\tau})$. The boundary condition is at the top of the atmosphere ($\\tilde{\\tau}=0$), where the downwelling radiation is the cosmic microwave background, $T_{\\mathrm{down}}$.\n$$\nT_{b, \\text{down}}(0) = T_{\\mathrm{down}} = T_{\\mathrm{atm}} + K \\exp(0) \\implies K = T_{\\mathrm{down}} - T_{\\mathrm{atm}}\n$$\nSo, the downwelling brightness temperature at any level $\\tilde{\\tau}$ is $T_{b, \\text{down}}(\\tilde{\\tau}) = T_{\\mathrm{atm}} + (T_{\\mathrm{down}} - T_{\\mathrm{atm}})\\exp(-\\tilde{\\tau})$. We need this at the surface, where $\\tilde{\\tau}=\\tau$.\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{sky,down}}(0) = T_{b, \\text{down}}(\\tau) = T_{\\mathrm{atm}} + (T_{\\mathrm{down}} - T_{\\mathrm{atm}})\\exp(-\\tau) = T_{\\mathrm{atm}}(1-\\exp(-\\tau)) + T_{\\mathrm{down}}\\exp(-\\tau)\n$$\nNow, substitute this into the expression for $T_b(0)$:\n$$\nT_{b}(0) = \\epsilon T_{s} + (1-\\epsilon) \\left[ T_{\\mathrm{atm}}(1-\\exp(-\\tau)) + T_{\\mathrm{down}}\\exp(-\\tau) \\right]\n$$\nWe can now determine the constant $C$ for the upwelling solution. At $\\tau'=0$:\n$$\nT_{b}(0) = T_{\\mathrmatm} + C \\exp(0) \\implies C = T_{b}(0) - T_{\\mathrm{atm}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $T_b(0)$:\n$$\nC = \\epsilon T_{s} + (1-\\epsilon) \\left[ T_{\\mathrm{atm}}(1-\\exp(-\\tau)) + T_{\\mathrm{down}}\\exp(-\\tau) \\right] - T_{\\mathrm{atm}}\n$$\n$$\nC = \\epsilon T_s + T_{\\mathrm{atm}} - \\epsilon T_{\\mathrm{atm}} - T_{\\mathrm{atm}}\\exp(-\\tau) + \\epsilon T_{\\mathrm{atm}}\\exp(-\\tau) + (1-\\epsilon)T_{\\mathrm{down}}\\exp(-\\tau) - T_{\\mathrm{atm}}\n$$\n$$\nC = \\epsilon(T_s - T_{\\mathrm{atm}}) - (1-\\epsilon)T_{\\mathrm{atm}}\\exp(-\\tau) + (1-\\epsilon)T_{\\mathrm{down}}\\exp(-\\tau)\n$$\n$$\nC = \\epsilon(T_s - T_{\\mathrm{atm}}) + (1-\\epsilon)(T_{\\mathrm{down}} - T_{\\mathrm{atm}})\\exp(-\\tau)\n$$\nThe specific solution for the upwelling brightness temperature at any level $\\tau'$ is:\n$$\nT_{b}(\\tau') = T_{\\mathrmatm} + \\left[ \\epsilon(T_s - T_{\\mathrm{atm}}) + (1-\\epsilon)(T_{\\mathrm{down}} - T_{\\mathrm{atm}})\\exp(-\\tau) \\right] \\exp(-\\tau')\n$$\nThe problem asks for the brightness temperature at the top of the atmosphere, which is at $\\tau'=\\tau$.\n$$\nT_{b}(\\tau) = T_{\\mathrmatm} + \\left[ \\epsilon(T_s - T_{\\mathrm{atm}}) + (1-\\epsilon)(T_{\\mathrm{down}} - T_{\\mathrm{atm}})\\exp(-\\tau) \\right] \\exp(-\\tau)\n$$\nExpanding this gives the final closed-form expression:\n$$\nT_{b}(\\tau) = T_{\\mathrmatm} + \\epsilon(T_s - T_{\\mathrm{atm}})\\exp(-\\tau) + (1-\\epsilon)(T_{\\mathrm{down}} - T_{\\mathrm{atm}})\\exp(-2\\tau)\n$$\nThis expression encapsulates the three main contributions to the TOA brightness temperature: direct atmospheric upwelling (embedded in the $T_{\\mathrm{atm}}$ term and modifications), surface emission attenuated by the atmosphere (second term), and reflected downwelling sky radiation attenuated by the atmosphere (third term). The $\\exp(-2\\tau)$ factor in the third term signifies a two-way path through the atmosphere.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically with the given values:\n$\\epsilon=0.85$\n$T_{s}=300\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n$\\tau=0.02$\n$T_{\\mathrm{down}}=2.7\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n$T_{\\mathrm{atm}}=280\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n\nWe calculate the components of the expression:\n$1 - \\epsilon = 1 - 0.85 = 0.15$\n$T_s - T_{\\mathrm{atm}} = 300 - 280 = 20\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n$T_{\\mathrm{down}} - T_{\\mathrm{atm}} = 2.7 - 280 = -277.3\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n\nSubstituting these into the equation for $T_b(\\tau)$:\n$$\nT_{b}(0.02) = 280 + (0.85)(20)\\exp(-0.02) + (0.15)(-277.3)\\exp(-2 \\times 0.02)\n$$\n$$\nT_{b}(0.02) = 280 + 17\\exp(-0.02) - 41.595\\exp(-0.04)\n$$\nUsing a calculator for the exponential terms:\n$\\exp(-0.02) \\approx 0.98019867$\n$\\exp(-0.04) \\approx 0.96078944$\n$$\nT_{b}(0.02) \\approx 280 + 17(0.98019867) - 41.595(0.96078944)\n$$\n$$\nT_{b}(0.02) \\approx 280 + 16.663377 - 39.968832\n$$\n$$\nT_{b}(0.02) \\approx 280 - 23.305455\n$$\n$$\nT_{b}(0.02) \\approx 256.694545\\ \\mathrm{K}\n$$\nRounding the final answer to four significant figures, we get $256.7\\ \\mathrm{K}$.",
