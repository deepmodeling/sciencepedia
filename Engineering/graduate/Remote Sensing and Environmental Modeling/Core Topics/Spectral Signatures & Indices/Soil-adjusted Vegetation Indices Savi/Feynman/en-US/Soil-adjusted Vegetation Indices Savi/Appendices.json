            "problem": "A multispectral sensor records surface reflectances in the red and near-infrared spectral bands, denoted by $R_{\\text{Red}}$ and $R_{\\text{NIR}}$, respectively, where $0 \\leq R_{\\text{Red}}, R_{\\text{NIR}} \\leq 1$. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is defined as the normalized contrast between $R_{\\text{NIR}}$ and $R_{\\text{Red}}$, and is widely used as a proxy for green vegetation presence. In sparsely vegetated areas, variations in soil brightness bias vegetation indices; to mitigate this, the Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) introduces a unitless soil adjustment parameter $L$ that adds to the brightness term and applies a compensatory gain to preserve dynamic range.\n\nStarting from the normalized difference structure of indices and the soil-brightness adjustment concept above (without assuming any specific numerical value of $L$), perform the following:\n\n1.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a condition under which the Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) equals the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and the subsequent calculation of the soil adjustment parameter $L$ for a specific case.\n\nFirst, we must formalize the definitions of the indices based on the provided descriptions.\n\nThe Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is described as the \"normalized contrast between $R_{\\text{NIR}}$ and $R_{\\text{Red}}$\". The standard mathematical representation of a normalized difference between two quantities $A$ and $B$ is $\\frac{A-B}{A+B}$. Applying this to the given reflectances, $R_{\\text{NIR}}$ and $R_{\\text{Red}}$, we have:\n$$ \\text{NDVI} = \\frac{R_{\\text{NIR}} - R_{\\text{Red}}}{R_{\\text{NIR}} + R_{\\text{Red}}} $$\nThe numerator represents the contrast, and the denominator represents the brightness, which normalizes the index.\n\nThe Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) is constructed starting from this structure. According to the problem statement:\n1. A soil adjustment parameter $L$ \"adds to the brightness term\". The brightness term in NDVI is the denominator, $R_{\\text{NIR}} + R_{\\text{Red}}$. Thus, the new denominator for SAVI is $R_{\\text{NIR}} + R_{\\text{Red}} + L$.\n2. A \"compensatory gain\" is applied to \"preserve dynamic range\". This is a multiplicative factor. The standard formulation of SAVI, consistent with this description, uses a gain factor of $(1+L)$. This factor ensures that for a given change in vegetation, the change in SAVI is of a similar magnitude to the change in NDVI.\n\nCombining these elements, the formula for SAVI is:\n$$ \\text{SAVI} = (1+L) \\frac{R_{\\text{NIR}} - R_{\\text{Red}}}{R_{\\text{NIR}} + R_{\\text{Red}} + L} $$\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the algebraic condition for SAVI = NDVI**\n\nWe are asked to find the condition relating $R_{\\text{NIR}}$, $R_{\\text{Red}}$, and $L$ under which $\\text{SAVI} = \\text{NDVI}$. We set the two expressions equal to each other:\n$$ (1+L) \\frac{R_{\\text{NIR}} - R_{\\text{Red}}}{R_{\\text{NIR}} + R_{\\text{Red}} + L} = \\frac{R_{\\text{NIR}} - R_{\\text{Red}}}{R_{\\text{NIR}} + R_{\\text{Red}}} $$\nTo solve this equation, we can rearrange it as follows:\n$$ (R_{\\text{NIR}} - R_{\\text{Red}}) \\left( \\frac{1+L}{R_{\\text{NIR}} + R_{\\text{Red}} + L} - \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{NIR}} + R_{\\text{Red}}} \\right) = 0 $$\nThis equation holds true if either of the two factors is equal to zero.\n\nCase 1: The first factor is zero.\n$$ R_{\\text{NIR}} - R_{\\text{Red}} = 0 \\implies R_{\\text{NIR}} = R_{\\text{Red}} $$\nIn this situation, representing surfaces with no green vegetation (like bare soil or water), both NDVI and SAVI are equal to $0$. This is a valid condition for equality.\n\nCase 2: The second factor is zero.\n$$ \\frac{1+L}{R_{\\text{NIR}} + R_{\\text{Red}} + L} - \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{NIR}} + R_{\\text{Red}}} = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{1+L}{R_{\\text{NIR}} + R_{\\text{Red}} + L} = \\frac{1}{R_{\\text{NIR}} + R_{\\text{Red}}} $$\nAssuming the denominators are non-zero (which is true for physical reflectances, as $R_{\\text{Red}}, R_{\\text{NIR}} \\ge 0$ and they are not simultaneously zero for land surfaces, and $L$ is typically non-negative), we can cross-multiply:\n$$ (1+L)(R_{\\text{NIR}} + R_{\\text{Red}}) = 1 \\cdot (R_{\\text{NIR}} + R_{\\text{Red}} + L) $$\n$$ R_{\\text{NIR}} + R_{\\text{Red}} + L(R_{\\text{NIR}} + R_{\\text{Red}}) = R_{\\text{NIR}} + R_{\\text{Red}} + L $$\nSubtracting $(R_{\\text{NIR}} + R_{\\text{Red}})$ from both sides gives:\n$$ L(R_{\\text{NIR}} + R_{\\text{Red}}) = L $$\nRearranging the terms to one side:\n$$ L(R_{\\text{NIR}} + R_{\\text{Red}}) - L = 0 $$\n$$ L(R_{\\text{NIR}} + R_{\\text{Red}} - 1) = 0 $$\nThis product is zero if and only if $L=0$ or $(R_{\\text{NIR}} + R_{\\text{Red}} - 1)=0$.\n\nSub-case 2a: $L=0$. If the soil adjustment parameter is zero, the SAVI formula reduces directly to the NDVI formula.\n$$ \\text{SAVI} = (1+0) \\frac{R_{\\text{NIR}} - R_{\\text{Red}}}{R_{\\text{NIR}} + R_{\\text{Red}} + 0} = \\text{NDVI} $$\nThis is a trivial but valid condition for equality.\n\nSub-case 2b: $R_{\\text{NIR}} + R_{\\text{Red}} - 1 = 0 \\implies R_{\\text{NIR}} + R_{\\text{Red}} = 1$.\nThis condition on the reflectances also ensures equality, regardless of the value of $L$ (provided $R_{\\text{NIR}} \\neq R_{\\text{Red}}$).\n\nTherefore, the complete algebraic condition for $\\text{SAVI} = \\text{NDVI}$ is a logical disjunction of the three derived conditions:\n$$ (R_{\\text{NIR}} = R_{\\text{Red}}) \\lor (L=0) \\lor (R_{\\text{NIR}} + R_{\\text{Red}} = 1) $$\n\n**Part 2: Determination of the value of L for a specific pixel**\n\nWe are given a pixel with reflectances $R_{\\text{NIR}} = 0.42$ and $R_{\\text{Red}} = 0.18$. We must find the unique value of $L$ for which $\\text{SAVI} = \\text{NDVI}$ for this pixel. This means we must find the value of $L$ that satisfies the condition derived in Part 1 for these specific reflectance values.\n\nLet's evaluate the three components of the disjunctive condition for the given pixel:\n1. Is $R_{\\text{NIR}} = R_{\\text{Red}}$? We have $0.42 \\neq 0.18$. This condition is false.\n2. Is $R_{\\text{NIR}} + R_{\\text{Red}} = 1$? We have $R_{\\text{NIR}} + R_{\\text{Red}} = 0.42 + 0.18 = 0.60$. This is not equal to $1$. This condition is also false.\n\nSince the overall condition for equality, $(R_{\\text{NIR}} = R_{\\text{Red}}) \\lor (L=0) \\lor (R_{\\text{NIR}} + R_{\\text{Red}} = 1)$, must hold, and the first and third parts are false for this specific pixel, the second part must be true.\nTherefore, for this pixel, the only way for SAVI to equal NDVI is if $L=0$.\n\nAlternatively, we can substitute the given reflectance values directly into the equation derived in Case 2:\n$$ L(R_{\\text{NIR}} + R_{\\text{Red}} - 1) = 0 $$\n$$ L(0.42 + 0.18 - 1) = 0 $$\n$$ L(0.60 - 1) = 0 $$\n$$ L(-0.40) = 0 $$\nThe unique solution to this equation for the variable $L$ is $L=0$.\n\nThe result is an exact value, $L=0$. The problem requires the answer to be expressed as a real number rounded to four significant figures. While the concept of significant figures is ambiguous for the exact number zero, a representation consistent with formats like $4.000$ for the number $4$ would be $0.0000$.\nThe unique value of the soil adjustment parameter $L$ for this pixel is exactly $0$.",

Both NDVI and SAVI decrease from dry to wet, but the magnitude of the decrease is smaller for SAVI than for NDVI, reflecting reduced sensitivity to soil background.\n\nB.

            "solution": "We begin from the definitions of reflectance and the indices. Let $R_{\\mathrm{Red}}$ and $R_{\\mathrm{NIR}}$ denote the top-of-canopy surface reflectances in the red and near-infrared bands, respectively.

It is well-posed, providing sufficient constraints to derive a unique solution. The language is objective and the setup is consistent. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and we may proceed with the solution.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the SAVI formula**\n\nWe start by proposing a general form for the new index that incorporates the given structural modifications. The problem states that the index generalizes the normalized difference by adding $L$ to the denominator and includes a scalar normalization factor, which we denote as $K(L)$. A plausible general form is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{SAVI} = K(L) \\frac{N - R}{N + R + L}\n$$\nNow, we apply the three design requirements to determine the function $K(L)$.\n\nRequirement 3 states that the index must be $0$ when $N = R$. Substituting $N=R$ into our proposed form gives:\n$$\n\\mathrm{SAVI} = K(L) \\frac{R - R}{R + R + L} = K(L) \\frac{0}{2R + L} = 0\n$$\nThis condition is satisfied for any function $K(L)$, provided the denominator $2R+L$ is not zero. Since $R \\ge 0$ and $L \\ge 0$, the denominator is only zero if $R=0$ and $L=0$. In this special case ($N=R=L=0$), the expression is an indeterminate form $0/0$, which we define as $0$ to satisfy the requirement universally. Thus, the factor $(N-R)$ in the numerator correctly implements this requirement.\n\nRequirement 2 states that the index must attain a value of $1$ for the ideal vegetation endmember, where $N=1$ and $R=0$. This must hold for any $L \\geq 0$. We substitute these values into the expression for SAVI:\n$$\n1 = K(L) \\frac{1 - 0}{1 + 0 + L} = K(L) \\frac{1}{1 + L}\n$$\nSolving for $K(L)$, we find the explicit form of the normalization factor:\n$$\nK(L) = 1 + L\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $K(L)$ back into our general form, we obtain the analytical form of the Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index:\n$$\n\\mathrm{SAVI} = (1 + L) \\frac{N - R}{N + R + L}\n$$\nFinally, we check Requirement 1, which states that the index should reduce to the NDVI structure when $L=0$. Setting $L=0$ in our derived formula:\n$$\n\\mathrm{SAVI}|_{L=0} = (1 + 0) \\frac{N - R}{N + R + 0} = \\frac{N - R}{N + R} = \\mathrm{NDVI}\n$$\nThis confirms that our derived expression for SAVI satisfies all three design requirements.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial \\mathrm{SAVI}}{\\partial L}$**\n\nWe now compute the partial derivative of SAVI with respect to $L$, treating $N$ and $R$ as constants. The expression for SAVI is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{SAVI}(L) = (N - R) \\left( \\frac{1 + L}{N + R + L} \\right)\n$$\nWe can use the quotient rule for differentiation, $\\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{u(x)}{v(x)}\\right) = \\frac{u'(x)v(x) - u(x)v'(x)}{[v(x)]^2}$, on the term in the parenthesis.\nLet $u(L) = 1 + L$ and $v(L) = N + R + L$.\nThe derivatives with respect to $L$ are $u'(L) = 1$ and $v'(L) = 1$.\n\nApplying the quotient rule:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial L} \\left( \\frac{1 + L}{N + R + L} \\right) = \\frac{(1)(N + R + L) - (1 + L)(1)}{(N + R + L)^2}\n$$\nSimplifying the numerator:\n$$\n(N + R + L) - (1 + L) = N + R + L - 1 - L = N + R - 1\n$$\nSo, the derivative of the fractional term is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial L} \\left( \\frac{1 + L}{N + R + L} \\right) = \\frac{N + R - 1}{(N + R + L)^2}\n$$\nMultiplying by the constant factor $(N-R)$ gives the final partial derivative of SAVI:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathrm{SAVI}}{\\partial L} = (N - R) \\frac{N + R - 1}{(N + R + L)^2}\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Discussion of insensitivity to $L$**\n\nThe index SAVI becomes insensitive to the choice of the parameter $L$ when its partial derivative $\\frac{\\partial \\mathrm{SAVI}}{\\partial L}$ is zero or close to zero. We analyze the expression for the derivative to identify such regimes.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathrm{SAVI}}{\\partial L} = \\frac{(N - R)(N + R - 1)}{(N + R + L)^2}\n$$\nThe derivative is exactly zero when its numerator is zero. This occurs under two distinct conditions:\n1.  $N - R = 0$, which means $N = R$. This corresponds to the \"grey line\" in the $N-R$ spectral space, representing surfaces with no dominant spectral difference between the red and near-infrared bands. Physically, this includes non-vegetated surfaces like bare soil, rocks, and man-made structures. For these surfaces, $\\mathrm{SAVI} = 0$ regardless of $L$, so the index is perfectly insensitive to the soil adjustment parameter, which is a desirable property.\n\n2.  $N + R - 1 = 0$, which means $N + R = 1$. This defines a line in the $N-R$ spectral space. For any pixel whose reflectances satisfy this condition, the SAVI becomes insensitive to $L$. To see this, substituting $N+R=1$ into the SAVI formula gives $\\mathrm{SAVI} = (1+L)\\frac{N-R}{1+L} = N-R$, which is independent of $L$.\n\nThe magnitude of the derivative, $|\\frac{\\partial \\mathrm{SAVI}}{\\partial L}|$, is small in the following physically meaningful regimes:\n-   **Low vegetation cover or non-vegetated surfaces**: Here, $N \\approx R$, so the term $(N-R)$ is close to zero, making the derivative small.\n-   **Dense vegetation canopies**: For dense, healthy vegetation, reflectance in the red band is very low ($R \\to 0$) and reflectance in the near-infrared is very high ($N \\to 1$). As this ideal condition is approached, the sum $N+R$ approaches $1$. Therefore, the term $(N+R-1)$ approaches $0$, causing the derivative $\\frac{\\partial \\mathrm{SAVI}}{\\partial L}$ to approach $0$. This is also a desirable property, as the influence of the soil background diminishes to zero under a full canopy, and thus the soil adjustment parameter should have a negligible effect.\n\nIn summary, the SAVI is insensitive to the soil parameter $L$ for non-vegetated surfaces and for very dense vegetation canopies, which are the two extremes of vegetation cover.",
