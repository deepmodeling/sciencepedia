A crucial aspect of this spectrum is the wavelength at which emission is strongest. This practice challenges you to derive this peak emission wavelength from first principles, leading to Wien's displacement law, and to connect it to the atmospheric windows used in thermal remote sensing . Mastering this derivation provides a fundamental link between an object's physical temperature and its observable radiative signature.",

            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on the fundamental principles of blackbody radiation as described by Planck's law and the Stefan-Boltzmann law. All required data, definitions, and conditions are explicitly provided, forming a self-contained and consistent problem statement. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or physically implausible conditions. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we may proceed with its solution.\n\nThe objective is to compute the fraction $f(T, \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2)$ of the total radiant exitance from a blackbody at absolute temperature $T$ that is contained within the spectral wavelength interval $[\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2]$. This fraction is defined by the ratio of the integrated spectral radiant exitance over the interval to the total radiant exitance over all wavelengths:\n$$\nf(T, \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2) = \\frac{\\int_{\\lambda_1}^{\\lambda_2} M_\\lambda(T)\\, d\\lambda}{M(T)}\n$$\nThe solution requires the numerical evaluation of this expression for several test cases.\n\nFirst, we establish the necessary physical formulas provided in the problem statement. The spectral radiant exitance for a Lambertian surface, $M_\\lambda(T)$, is given by:\n$$\nM_\\lambda(T) = \\pi B_\\lambda(T)\n$$\nwhere $B_\\lambda(T)$ is Planck's law for spectral radiance:\n$$\nB_\\lambda(T) = \\frac{2 h c^2}{\\lambda^5} \\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{h c}{\\lambda k_B T}\\right) - 1\\right)^{-1}\n$$\nHere, $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum, $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant, $\\lambda$ is the wavelength, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nCombining these gives the explicit form of the integrand:\n$$\nM_\\lambda(T) = \\frac{2 \\pi h c^2}{\\lambda^5} \\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{h c}{\\lambda k_B T}\\right) - 1\\right)^{-1}\n$$\nThis function represents the power emitted per unit area per unit wavelength interval. Its integral over the specified wavelength range $[\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2]$ gives the radiant exitance within that band.\n\nThe denominator in the fraction is the total radiant exitance, $M(T)$, given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law:\n$$\nM(T) = \\sigma T^4\n$$\nThe Stefan-Boltzmann constant, $\\sigma$, is defined in terms of the fundamental constants as:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{2 \\pi^5 k_B^4}{15 h^3 c^2}\n$$\nThis definition ensures consistency, as $M(T)$ is precisely the result of integrating $M_\\lambda(T)$ over the entire spectrum from $\\lambda=0$ to $\\lambda=\\infty$.\n\nThe computational procedure is as follows:\n1.  Define the high-precision values for the fundamental physical constants $h$, $c$, and $k_B$. The value of $\\pi$ is also required.\n2.  Using these constants, calculate the value of the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, $\\sigma$.\n3.  For each test case, specified by a triplet $(T, \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2)$:\n    a. If $\\lambda_1 = \\lambda_2$, the interval has zero width, so the integral is zero, and thus the fraction $f$ is $0$.\n    b. The input wavelengths $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$ are given in micrometers ($\\mu$m). They must be converted to the base SI unit of meters (m) for consistency with the physical constants by multiplying by $10^{-6}$.\n    c. The numerator, $\\int_{\\lambda_1}^{\\lambda_2} M_\\lambda(T)\\, d\\lambda$, must be computed using a robust numerical integration method. We will employ an adaptive quadrature routine, which is well-suited for integrating smooth but potentially rapidly varying functions like the Planck function. The integrand $M_\\lambda(T)$ will be evaluated at points selected by the integration algorithm between the meter-converted limits $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$.\n    d. The denominator, $M(T) = \\sigma T^4$, is calculated directly using the temperature $T$ for the specific test case.\n    e. The final fraction is computed by dividing the result of the numerical integration by the calculated total radiant exitance.\n\nThis direct approach, integrating the dimensionful function $M_\\lambda(T)$ and normalizing by the total exitance $M(T)$, adheres strictly to the problem's formulation. It avoids analytical simplifications that, while elegant, are proscribed by the instruction to perform an \"explicit numerical integration of $M_\\lambda(T)$\". The algorithm will be implemented in a function that processes the provided test cases and formats the output as specified.",
