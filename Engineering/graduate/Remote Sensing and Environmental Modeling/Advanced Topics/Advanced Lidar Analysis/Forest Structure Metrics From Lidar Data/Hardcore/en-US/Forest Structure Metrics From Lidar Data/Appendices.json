A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem states that for a given height threshold $h_t$, the event that a return has a normalized height $z_n \\ge h_t$ is a Bernoulli trial. Let $p = C(h_t)$ be the probability of this event, which we wish to estimate. For each of the $N$ returns, we can define an indicator random variable $X_i$ for $i=1, \\dots, N$:\n$$\nX_i = \n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{if } z_{n,i} \\ge h_t \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } z_{n,i} < h_t\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nUnder the given model, each $X_i$ follows a Bernoulli distribution with parameter $p$, i.e., $X_i \\sim \\mathrm{Bernoulli}(p)$. The probability mass function for a single observation $x_i$ is $P(X_i = x_i) = p^{x_i}(1-p)^{1-x_i}$.\n\nThe problem assumes the returns are independent samples. Therefore, the joint probability of observing a specific sequence of outcomes $\\{x_1, \\dots, x_N\\}$ is the product of their individual probabilities. This function, viewed as a function of the parameter $p$ for a fixed set of observations, is the likelihood function $L(p)$.\n$$\nL(p \\mid x_1, \\dots, x_N) = \\prod_{i=1}^{N} P(X_i = x_i) = \\prod_{i=1}^{N} p^{x_i}(1-p)^{1-x_i}\n$$\nThis expression can be simplified by grouping the terms:\n$$\nL(p) = p^{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i} (1-p)^{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (1-x_i)} = p^{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i} (1-p)^{N - \\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i}\n$$\nThe sum $\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i$ is the total number of returns with $z_n \\ge h_t$, which is given as $k$. Substituting this into the likelihood function gives:\n$$\nL(p) = p^k (1-p)^{N-k}\n$$\nTo find the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of $p$, we find the value of $p$ that maximizes $L(p)$. It is analytically more convenient to maximize the log-likelihood function, $\\ell(p) = \\ln(L(p))$, since the logarithm is a strictly increasing function.\n$$\n\\ell(p) = \\ln\\left(p^k (1-p)^{N-k}\\right) = k \\ln(p) + (N-k) \\ln(1-p)\n$$\nTo find the maximum, we take the derivative of $\\ell(p)$ with respect to $p$ and set it to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\ell}{dp} = \\frac{k}{p} - \\frac{N-k}{1-p} = 0\n$$\nSolving for $p$:\n$$\n\\frac{k}{p} = \\frac{N-k}{1-p}\n$$\n$$\nk(1-p) = p(N-k)\n$$\n$$\nk - kp = Np - kp\n$$\n$$\nk = Np\n$$\nThis gives the estimator $\\hat{p}$:\n$$\n\\hat{p} = \\frac{k}{N}\n$$\nTo confirm this corresponds to a maximum, we examine the second derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\ell}{dp^2} = -\\frac{k}{p^2} - \\frac{N-k}{(1-p)^2}\n$$\nFor the given data, $N=1200$ and $k=840$, so $k > 0$ and $N-k = 360 > 0$. For any $p \\in (0,1)$, both terms in the second derivative are negative. Therefore, $\\frac{d^2\\ell}{dp^2} < 0$, which confirms that $\\hat{p} = k/N$ is indeed the maximum likelihood estimator.\nThe MLE for the canopy cover $C(h_t)$ is thus:\n$$\n\\hat{C}(h_t) = \\frac{k}{N}\n$$\n\n### Numerical Computation\nFor the given plot data at $h_t = 2 \\ \\mathrm{m}$, we have $N=1200$ and $k=840$. The numerical value of the estimator is:\n$$\n\\hat{C}(2) = \\frac{840}{1200} = \\frac{84}{120} = \\frac{7 \\times 12}{10 \\times 12} = \\frac{7}{10} = 0.7\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Thus, the value is $0.7000$.\n\n### Effect of the Threshold $h_t$\nFrom first principles, the canopy cover $C(h_t)$ is defined as the probability that the normalized height $z_n$ of a random return is greater than or equal to the threshold $h_t$:\n$$\nC(h_t) = P(z_n \\ge h_t)\n$$\nLet $F(z)$ be the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the random variable $z_n$, defined as $F(z) = P(z_n \\le z)$. The probability $P(z_n \\ge h_t)$ can be expressed in terms of the CDF as $1 - P(z_n < h_t)$. Assuming $z_n$ is a continuous variable, $P(z_n < h_t) = P(z_n \\le h_t) = F(h_t)$. Thus,\n$$\nC(h_t) = 1 - F(h_t)\n$$\nThis expression is the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF), also known as the survival function. A fundamental property of any CDF $F(z)$ is that it is a non-decreasing function of its argument $z$. That is, for any two thresholds $h_{t1}$ and $h_{t2}$ such that $h_{t1} \\le h_{t2}$, it must be true that $F(h_{t1}) \\le F(h_{t2})$.\nFrom this property, it follows that:\n$$\n-F(h_{t1}) \\ge -F(h_{t2})\n$$\n$$\n1 - F(h_{t1}) \\ge 1 - F(h_{t2})\n$$\n$$\nC(h_{t1}) \\ge C(h_{t2})\n$$\nTherefore, $C(h_t)$ is a non-increasing function of the height threshold $h_t$. As one increases the threshold $h_t$, the set of returns satisfying $z_n \\ge h_t$ becomes a subset of (or equal to) the set for any lower threshold. Consequently, the fraction of returns meeting this stricter criterion, and thus the estimated canopy cover, must either decrease or remain the same.",

The formula simplifies to the sum of variances (addition in quadrature for standard deviations):\n$$ \\sigma_{H_n}^2 = \\sigma_z^2 + \\sigma_{DTM}^2 \\quad (\\text{for } \\rho=0) $$\n\nWe will now evaluate each option using these principles.\n\n**A. At Site A, the standard deviation of normalized heights is approximately $0.224\\,\\mathrm{m}$, and the LiDAR elevation measurement contributes a larger share of the variance than the DTM.**\n\nFor Site A, we have $\\sigma_z = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\sigma_{DTM} = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{m}$, and the errors are independent, so $\\rho = 0$.

Since $0.36\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$ is nearly $6$ times larger than $0.0625\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$, it is clear that the DTM uncertainty is the dominant contributor to the total uncertainty. The second part of the statement is correct.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. At Site C, the positive correlation between the LiDAR elevation error and terrain error leads to a normalized height variance that exceeds what it would be under independence.**\n\nFor Site C, we have $\\sigma_z = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{m}$, $\\sigma_{DTM} = 0.40\\,\\mathrm{m}$, and $\\rho = 0.60$.\nThe variance of the normalized height is given by the general formula:\n$$ \\sigma_{H_n}^2 = \\sigma_z^2 + \\sigma_{DTM}^2 - 2 \\rho \\sigma_z \\sigma_{DTM} $$\nUnder independence ($\\rho = 0$), the variance would be $\\sigma_{H_n, \\text{indep}}^2 = \\sigma_z^2 + \\sigma_{DTM}^2$.\nComparing the two, the variance with positive correlation is:\n$$ \\sigma_{H_n, \\text{corr}}^2 = \\sigma_{H_n, \\text{indep}}^2 - 2 \\rho \\sigma_z \\sigma_{DTM} $$\nSince $\\rho = 0.60 > 0$, $\\sigma_z > 0$, and $\\sigma_{DTM} > 0$, the term $2 \\rho \\sigma_z \\sigma_{DTM}$ is positive. Therefore, the variance of the difference is *reduced* by the positive correlation. Intuitively, if both the LiDAR point and the terrain model underneath it are biased high by a similar amount, their difference ($H_n$) will have less error than if their errors were independent.\nThe statement claims the variance *exceeds* what it would be under independence, which is the opposite of what the error propagation formula indicates.\nNumerically:\nVariance under independence: $\\sigma_{H_n, \\text{indep}}^2 = (0.20)^2 + (0.40)^2 = 0.04 + 0.16 = 0.20\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$.\nVariance with correlation: $\\sigma_{H_n, \\text{corr}}^2 = 0.20 - 2(0.60)(0.20)(0.40) = 0.20 - 0.096 = 0.104\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$.\nAs expected, $0.104\\,\\mathrm{m}^2 < 0.20\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$. The statement is false.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. In steep, vegetated areas with low ground point density, DTM uncertainty typically dominates normalized height error because terrain interpolation error and occlusion-driven ground misclassification can surpass LiDAR ranging and georeferencing noise.**\n\nThis is a qualitative statement about the sources of error in LiDAR analysis.\n-   **\"Steep, vegetated areas with low ground point density\"**: These conditions are the primary drivers for high DTM uncertainty. Vegetation occludes the ground, reducing the number of laser pulses that reach it, leading to low ground point density. Interpolating a surface (the DTM) from a sparse set of points, especially over complex, steep terrain, is inherently prone to large errors.\n-   **\"Terrain interpolation error and occlusion-driven ground misclassification\"**: These are the specific mechanisms of DTM error. Ground filtering algorithms may fail to correctly classify the few true ground returns or may misclassify low vegetation as ground, biasing the DTM.\n-   **\"LiDAR ranging and georeferencing noise\"**: This refers to the intrinsic precision of the LiDAR measurement for a single point, i.e., $\\sigma_z$. These values are typically in the range of $0.15-0.30\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n-   The statement posits that the DTM uncertainty ($\\sigma_{DTM}$) arising from interpolation and misclassification in challenging environments can be much larger than the intrinsic LiDAR point uncertainty ($\\sigma_z$). This is a well-established principle in LiDAR remote sensing and is empirically supported by numerous studies. The data from Site B ($\\sigma_{DTM} = 0.60\\,\\mathrm{m}$ vs. $\\sigma_z = 0.25\\,\\mathrm{m}$) provides a quantitative example of this exact principle. The reasoning provided is entirely correct.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. When DTM uncertainty dominates normalized height error, filtering out canopy returns with high incidence angle will substantially reduce the normalized height standard deviation across the scene.**\n\nThe premise is that DTM uncertainty dominates, i.e., $\\sigma_{DTM}^2 \\gg \\sigma_z^2$. We can use Site B as our model, where this condition holds. The total variance is $\\sigma_{H_n}^2 = \\sigma_z^2 + \\sigma_{DTM}^2$.\nThe proposed action is \"filtering out canopy returns with high incidence angle\". This action primarily affects the uncertainty of the canopy returns themselves, i.e., it is a strategy to reduce $\\sigma_z$. High-angle returns can have slightly larger ranging and positional errors.\nHowever, this filter does not affect the DTM or its uncertainty, $\\sigma_{DTM}$, which is the dominant error source.\nLet's analyze the impact. At Site B, $\\sigma_{H_n} = 0.650\\,\\mathrm{m}$, with variance components $\\sigma_z^2 = 0.0625\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$ and $\\sigma_{DTM}^2 = 0.36\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$.\nSuppose the filtering is very effective and reduces $\\sigma_z$ by $20\\%$, from $0.25\\,\\mathrm{m}$ to $0.20\\,\\mathrm{m}$. The new LiDAR variance would be $(0.20)^2 = 0.04\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$.\nThe new total variance would be $\\sigma_{H_n, \\text{new}}^2 = 0.04\\,\\mathrm{m}^2 + 0.36\\,\\mathrm{m}^2 = 0.40\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$.\nThe new standard deviation would be $\\sigma_{H_n, \\text{new}} = \\sqrt{0.40\\,\\mathrm{m}^2} \\approx 0.632\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\nThe reduction in standard deviation is $0.650\\,\\mathrm{m} - 0.632\\,\\mathrm{m} = 0.018\\,\\mathrm{m}$. This is a mere $2.8\\%$ reduction in the total uncertainty. This cannot be considered a \"substantial\" reduction. To achieve a substantial reduction, one must target the dominant error source, which in this case is the DTM. The statement proposes an action that targets the non-dominant error source, resulting in a minimal overall improvement.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.",
