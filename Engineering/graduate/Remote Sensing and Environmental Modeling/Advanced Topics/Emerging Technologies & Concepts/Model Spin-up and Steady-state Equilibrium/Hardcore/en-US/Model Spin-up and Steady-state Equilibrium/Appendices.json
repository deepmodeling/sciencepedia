During the model spin-up period, data assimilation is withheld to allow the model to approach a steady-state equilibrium under prescribed atmospheric forcing. The prescribed precipitation forcing is taken from Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) and, for the spin-up design, is treated as temporally constant. Assume the root-zone soil water storage, denoted by $S(t)$ and measured in millimeters, follows conservation of mass for soil water at the daily time scale:\n$$\\frac{dS}{dt} = I - E(S) - R(S),$$\nwhere $I$ is the infiltration flux from precipitation, $E(S)$ is evapotranspiration, and $R(S)$ is runoff. For the spin-up design, assume the following scientifically defensible simplifications consistent with unsaturated conditions below the threshold for surface runoff generation:\n- The entire precipitation infiltrates so that $I = P$, where $P$ is a constant daily mean precipitation rate.\n- Runoff is negligible, $R(S) = 0$, for the storage range of interest.\n- Evapotranspiration can be approximated by a linear function of storage, $E(S) = \\alpha S$, arising from a first-order linearization of the Penman–Monteith surface conductance around the operating point; here $\\alpha$ is a constant with units of day$^{-1}$.\n\nLet the initial storage be $S(0) = S_0$.

            "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\nThe following information is explicitly provided in the problem statement:\n- The conservation of mass for soil water storage, $S(t)$, is given by the differential equation: $$\\frac{dS}{dt} = I - E(S) - R(S)$$\n- $S(t)$ is the root-zone soil water storage in millimeters.\n- $t$ is time in days.\n- $I$ is the infiltration flux.\n- $E(S)$ is the evapotranspiration flux.\n- $R(S)$ is the runoff flux.\n- For the spin-up period, the following simplifying assumptions are made:\n  1.

The model, $\\frac{dS}{dt} = P - \\alpha S$, is a standard, albeit simplified, representation of a land surface water balance, known as a linear reservoir model. Such models are widely used in hydrology for analytical studies and are physically justifiable as a first-order approximation. The parameters are stated to be physically plausible, and their values are consistent with a semiarid environment. The context of model spin-up for data assimilation with SMAP and GPM data is highly relevant to the fields of hydrology and remote sensing. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a first-order linear ordinary differential equation with a constant coefficient and a constant forcing term, along with an initial condition. This constitutes a well-posed initial value problem, which is guaranteed to have a unique and stable solution. The condition defining the spin-up time $T$ is also mathematically precise.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. There are no subjective or opinion-based elements.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, complete, and objective. A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nFirst, we substitute the given assumptions into the general conservation equation:\n$$\\frac{dS}{dt} = P - \\alpha S - 0$$\nThis gives the specific ordinary differential equation (ODE) governing the system:\n$$\\frac{dS}{dt} = P - \\alpha S$$\n\nNext, we determine the steady-state equilibrium storage, $S_{\\infty}$. By definition, this is the state where the storage no longer changes, i.e., $\\frac{dS}{dt} = 0$.\n$$0 = P - \\alpha S_{\\infty}$$\nSolving for $S_{\\infty}$ gives:\n$$S_{\\infty} = \\frac{P}{\\alpha}$$\n\nNow, we solve the ODE for $S(t)$. The ODE can be rewritten as:\n$$\\frac{dS}{dt} + \\alpha S = P$$\nThis is a first-order linear inhomogeneous ODE. We can solve it using the method of integrating factors. The integrating factor, $\\mu(t)$, is given by:\n$$\\mu(t) = \\exp\\left(\\int \\alpha \\, dt\\right) = \\exp(\\alpha t)$$\nMultiplying the ODE by $\\mu(t)$:\n$$\\exp(\\alpha t)\\frac{dS}{dt} + \\alpha \\exp(\\alpha t) S = P \\exp(\\alpha t)$$\nThe left-hand side is the derivative of the product $S(t)\\exp(\\alpha t)$ with respect to $t$:\n$$\\frac{d}{dt}\\left(S(t)\\exp(\\alpha t)\\right) = P \\exp(\\alpha t)$$\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $t$:\n$$\\int \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(S(t)\\exp(\\alpha t)\\right) dt = \\int P \\exp(\\alpha t) dt$$\n$$S(t)\\exp(\\alpha t) = \\frac{P}{\\alpha}\\exp(\\alpha t) + C$$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration. Dividing by $\\exp(\\alpha t)$ to solve for $S(t)$:\n$$S(t) = \\frac{P}{\\alpha} + C \\exp(-\\alpha t)$$\nWe recognize that $\\frac{P}{\\alpha} = S_{\\infty}$, so the solution is:\n$$S(t) = S_{\\infty} + C \\exp(-\\alpha t)$$\nTo find the constant $C$, we apply the initial condition $S(0) = S_0$:\n$$S(0) = S_{\\infty} + C \\exp(-\\alpha \\cdot 0) = S_{\\infty} + C$$\n$$S_0 = S_{\\infty} + C \\implies C = S_0 - S_{\\infty}$$\nSubstituting this back into the solution for $S(t)$, we obtain the complete solution for the storage dynamics:\n$$S(t) = S_{\\infty} + (S_0 - S_{\\infty})\\exp(-\\alpha t)$$\n\nThe spin-up duration $T$ is defined as the minimal time such that the condition $\\frac{|S(T) - S_{\\infty}|}{S_{\\infty}} \\le \\varepsilon$ is met. To find this minimal time, we solve for the case of equality:\n$$\\frac{|S(T) - S_{\\infty}|}{S_{\\infty}} = \\varepsilon$$\nFrom the solution for $S(t)$, we can write:\n$$S(T) - S_{\\infty} = (S_0 - S_{\\infty})\\exp(-\\alpha T)$$\nTaking the absolute value:\n$$|S(T) - S_{\\infty}| = |(S_0 - S_{\\infty})\\exp(-\\alpha T)| = |S_0 - S_{\\infty}|\\exp(-\\alpha T)$$\nsince $\\exp(-\\alpha T)$ is always positive. Substituting this into the condition for $T$:\n$$\\frac{|S_0 - S_{\\infty}|\\exp(-\\alpha T)}{S_{\\infty}} = \\varepsilon$$\nNow, we solve for $T$. First, isolate the exponential term:\n$$\\exp(-\\alpha T) = \\frac{\\varepsilon S_{\\infty}}{|S_0 - S_{\\infty}|}$$\nTake the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$-\\alpha T = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon S_{\\infty}}{|S_0 - S_{\\infty}|}\\right)$$\nFinally, solve for $T$:\n$$T = -\\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\varepsilon S_{\\infty}}{|S_0 - S_{\\infty}|}\\right)$$\nUsing the property $\\ln(a/b) = -\\ln(b/a)$, we can write this in a more convenient form:\n$$T = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\ln\\left(\\frac{|S_0 - S_{\\infty}|}{\\varepsilon S_{\\infty}}\\right)$$\nThis is the analytical expression for $T$. To express it solely in terms of the given parameters $P$, $\\alpha$, $S_0$, and $\\varepsilon$, we substitute $S_{\\infty} = P/\\alpha$:\n$$T = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\ln\\left(\\frac{|S_0 - P/\\alpha|}{\\varepsilon (P/\\alpha)}\\right)$$\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\n\nWe now evaluate $T$ using the provided numerical values:\n- $P = 5$ mm day$^{-1}$\n- $\\alpha = 0.1$ day$^{-1}$\n- $S_0 = 10$ mm\n- $\\varepsilon = 0.02$\n\nFirst, calculate the steady-state storage $S_{\\infty}$:\n$$S_{\\infty} = \\frac{P}{\\alpha} = \\frac{5}{0.1} = 50 \\text{ mm}$$\nNext, substitute this and the other values into the expression for $T$:\n$$T = \\frac{1}{0.1} \\ln\\left(\\frac{|10 - 50|}{0.02 \\times 50}\\right)$$\n$$T = 10 \\ln\\left(\\frac{|-40|}{1}\\right)$$\n$$T = 10 \\ln(40)$$\nNow we calculate the numerical value:\n$$T \\approx 10 \\times 3.688879... \\text{ days}$$\n$$T \\approx 36.88879... \\text{ days}$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as required:\n$$T \\approx 36.89 \\text{ days}$$",

Since the soil pool has a much slower turnover rate ($\\mu < \\lambda$), it will take longer to approach its steady state. Therefore, we expect $T_S > T_V$, and the overall spin-up time will be determined by the soil pool, so $T = T_S$.\n\nWe must find the smallest $T$ that satisfies the equality for the soil condition:\n$$\n1.25\\exp(-0.1 T) - 0.25\\exp(-0.5 T) = 0.01\n$$\nFor large $T$, the term $\\exp(-0.5 T)$ decays much faster than $\\exp(-0.1 T)$.

The approximation of neglecting the $\\exp(-0.5 T)$ term in the soil equation is also highly accurate, as its coefficient is already smaller and its exponential decay is much faster.\nThe minimal spin-up time $T$ is the solution to the transcendental equation for the soil pool. Our approximation $T \\approx 30 \\ln(5)$ is an excellent estimate.\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures:\n$$\nT \\approx 48.28 \\text{ years}\n$$",

            "solution": "The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and internally consistent. The Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process is a standard model for mean-reverting systems, and the Fokker-Planck equation is the correct framework for analyzing the evolution of its probability density. All provided parameters and conditions are sufficient for a unique solution. We may proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe stochastic differential equation (SDE) for the soil-moisture anomaly $x(t)$ is given as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}x(t) = -k\\,x(t)\\,\\mathrm{d}t + \\sqrt{2D}\\,\\mathrm{d}W_t\n$$\nThis corresponds to a drift term $a(x) = -kx$ and a constant diffusion coefficient. The Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) provided is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p(x,t)}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\big[a(x)\\,p(x,t)\\big] + D\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2}p(x,t)}{\\partial x^{2}}\n$$\nSubstituting $a(x) = -kx$ into the FPE yields the specific equation for this process:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p(x,t)}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\big[(-kx)p(x,t)\\big] + D\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2}p(x,t)}{\\partial x^{2}} = k\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\big[x\\,p(x,t)\\big] + D\\,\\frac{\\partial^{2}p(x,t)}{\\partial x^{2}}\n$$\nThis equation governs the time evolution of the probability density function $p(x,t)$ of the anomaly $x(t)$.\n\n**1. Stationary Probability Density Function and Variance**\n\nThe stationary probability density function, $p_{\\infty}(x)$, is defined as the solution to the FPE in the limit $t \\to \\infty$, where the density no longer changes with time. Thus, we set $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = 0$:\n$$\n0 = k\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\big[x\\,p_{\\infty}(x)\\big] + D\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^{2}p_{\\infty}(x)}{\\mathrm{d}x^{2}}\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as the divergence of the probability current, $J(x)$, being zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x} \\left( kx p_{\\infty}(x) + D \\frac{\\mathrm{d}p_{\\infty}(x)}{\\mathrm{d}x} \\right) = 0\n$$\nThe term inside the parenthesis is the negative of the probability current. Integrating with respect to $x$ shows that this term must be a constant. The physical boundary condition of vanishing probability flux at $|x| \\to \\infty$ requires this constant to be zero. Therefore:\n$$\nkx p_{\\infty}(x) + D \\frac{\\mathrm{d}p_{\\infty}(x)}{\\mathrm{d}x} = 0\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation for $p_{\\infty}(x)$. Rearranging and separating variables gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}p_{\\infty}}{p_{\\infty}} = -\\frac{k}{D} x \\,\\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nIntegrating both sides yields:\n$$\n\\ln(p_{\\infty}(x)) = -\\frac{k}{2D}x^{2} + C'\n$$\nwhere $C'$ is the constant of integration. Exponentiating gives the form of the stationary PDF:\n$$\np_{\\infty}(x) = C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k x^{2}}{2D}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $C=\\exp(C')$. This is the functional form of a Gaussian distribution with mean $0$. A general Gaussian PDF is $p(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\sigma^2}}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)$. By comparing the exponents, we identify the stationary variance $V_{\\infty} = \\sigma^2$:\n$$\n\\frac{x^2}{2\\sigma^2} = \\frac{k x^2}{2D} \\implies V_{\\infty} = \\sigma^2 = \\frac{D}{k}\n$$\nThe constant $C$ is found by the normalization condition $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} p_{\\infty}(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x = 1$. Using the standard Gaussian integral, $C = 1/\\sqrt{2\\pi V_{\\infty}} = 1/\\sqrt{2\\pi D/k}$. Thus, the stationary PDF is a Gaussian distribution with mean $0$ and variance $V_{\\infty} = D/k$.\n\n**2. Time Evolution of the Variance $V(t)$**\n\nThe variance of the process at time $t$ is $V(t) = \\mathbb{E}[x(t)^{2}]$. We can derive its governing equation from the FPE. The time derivative of $V(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^{2} p(x,t) \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^{2} \\frac{\\partial p(x,t)}{\\partial t} \\,\\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\partial p/\\partial t$ from the FPE:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^{2} \\left( k\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\big[x p\\big] + D\\frac{\\partial^{2}p}{\\partial x^{2}} \\right) \\mathrm{d}x\n$$\nWe evaluate the two terms using integration by parts, assuming boundary terms at $\\pm\\infty$ vanish.\nFor the first term:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} kx^{2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}[xp] \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\big[kx^{3}p\\big]_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} - \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (2kx)(xp) \\,\\mathrm{d}x = 0 - 2k\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x^{2}p\\,\\mathrm{d}x = -2k V(t)\n$$\nFor the second term:\n$$\n\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} Dx^{2} \\frac{\\partial^{2}p}{\\partial x^{2}} \\,\\mathrm{d}x = \\big[Dx^{2} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x}\\big]_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} - \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (2Dx) \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} \\,\\mathrm{d}x = 0 - \\left(\\big[2Dxp\\big]_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} - \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} (2D)p \\,\\mathrm{d}x \\right) = 2D \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} p\\,\\mathrm{d}x = 2D\n$$\nCombining these results gives the ordinary differential equation for the variance $V(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -2k V(t) + 2D\n$$\nTo solve this ODE, we use the initial condition $x(0) = 0$, which implies $V(0) = \\mathbb{E}[x(0)^{2}] = 0$. The ODE is a first-order linear equation, which can be rearranged as $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V}{\\mathrm{d}t} + 2kV = 2D$. The solution is of the form $V(t) = V_{\\text{homogeneous}} + V_{\\text{particular}}$. The particular solution is a constant, $V_p = 2D/(2k) = D/k$. The homogeneous solution is $C\\exp(-2kt)$.\nThus, $V(t) = \\frac{D}{k} + C\\exp(-2kt)$. Applying the initial condition $V(0)=0$:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{D}{k} + C\\exp(0) \\implies C = -\\frac{D}{k}\n$$\nThe solution for the time-dependent variance is:\n$$\nV(t) = \\frac{D}{k} - \\frac{D}{k}\\exp(-2kt) = \\frac{D}{k}(1 - \\exp(-2kt))\n$$\nRecognizing that $V_{\\infty} = D/k$, we can write this as $V(t) = V_{\\infty}(1 - \\exp(-2kt))$.\n\n**3. Spin-up Time $t_{0.95}$**\n\nThe spin-up time $t_{0.95}$ is defined as the smallest time $t$ for which the ratio $V(t)/V_{\\infty}$ is at least $0.95$.\n$$\n\\frac{V(t_{0.95})}{V_{\\infty}} = \\frac{V_{\\infty}(1 - \\exp(-2kt_{0.95}))}{V_{\\infty}} = 1 - \\exp(-2kt_{0.95}) = 0.95\n$$\nSolving for $t_{0.95}$:\n$$\n\\exp(-2kt_{0.95}) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05\n$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n-2kt_{0.95} = \\ln(0.05)\n$$\nIsolating $t_{0.95}$ gives the required closed-form expression in terms of $k$ and the fraction $0.95$:\n$$\nt_{0.95} = -\\frac{\\ln(1-0.95)}{2k} = -\\frac{\\ln(0.05)}{2k}\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the provided constants. The value of $D$ is not required for this final calculation. We are given $k = 0.18\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}$.\n$$\nt_{0.95} = -\\frac{\\ln(0.05)}{2 \\times 0.18\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}} = -\\frac{-2.99573227...}{0.36\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}} \\approx 8.3214785...\\,\\mathrm{days}\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get $8.321$ days.",
