            "problem": "A passive optical remote sensing pixel located on a sloped terrain facet is observed under clear-sky conditions. The remotely sensed reflectance $R$ is defined as the ratio of exitant radiance to incident irradiance under the assumption that the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) is approximately isotropic, that is, the surface behaves Lambertian over the relevant angular range. For a direct solar beam with extraterrestrial irradiance $E_{0}$, the irradiance incident on a surface element is given by the projection of the beam onto the surface’s normal direction. On a horizontal surface, the incident irradiance is proportional to $\\cos \\theta_{s}$, where $\\theta_{s}$ is the solar zenith angle. On a tilted surface, the incident irradiance is proportional to $\\cos i$, where $i$ is the local incidence angle between the solar beam and the surface normal determined by the terrain geometry and solar position.\n\nStarting from these geometric and radiative definitions, derive an expression for the terrain-normalized reflectance $R_{corr}$ that would be observed if the same facet were horizontal under the same atmospheric and sensor conditions. Then, using this expression, compute $R_{corr}$ for a pixel with observed reflectance $R_{obs} = 0.12$, solar zenith angle $\\theta_{s} = 35^{\\circ}$, and local illumination factor $\\cos i = 0.6$. Treat trigonometric functions with arguments in degrees by converting $\\theta_{s}$ to radians before evaluation.\n\nAssume the measured $R_{obs}$ is corrupted by additive, zero-mean Gaussian noise with standard deviation $\\sigma_{R} = 0.05$ (reflectance units). Treat $R_{obs}$ as the best estimate of the true mean reflectance and model the corrected reflectance as a linear transformation of the noisy measurement. Under the physical constraint that reflectance for passive optical remote sensing is bounded between $0$ and $1$, compute the probability (as a decimal) that the corrected reflectance lies within the interval $[0, 1]$. Round all numerical results to four significant figures. The final answers should be expressed in dimensionless reflectance units and the probability as a decimal (no percentage sign).",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a terrain-normalized reflectance, a subsequent numerical calculation, and a probabilistic analysis based on a noise model.

The assumptions (Lambertian surface, direct illumination) are common simplifications used to establish a first-order model. The problem is well-posed, as it provides a clear set of objectives and all necessary data ($R_{obs}$, $\\theta_s$, $\\cos i$, $\\sigma_R$) to achieve them. The language is objective and the values are physically realistic. The problem is not trivial, as it requires derivation, numerical computation, and application of probability theory to an error model. No scientific laws are violated, and the setup is internally consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. We proceed with the solution.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Terrain-Normalized Reflectance\nLet $\\rho_{\\text{true}}$ be the intrinsic, terrain-independent Lambertian reflectance of the surface material. This is the quantity the problem names \"terrain-normalized reflectance\", $R_{\\text{corr}}$.\nFor a Lambertian surface, the exitant radiance $L$ is related to the incident irradiance $E_{\\text{inc}}$ and the intrinsic reflectance $\\rho_{\\text{true}}$ by the formula:\n$$L = \\frac{\\rho_{\\text{true}}}{\\pi} E_{\\text{inc}}$$\nThe incident irradiance on the tilted surface, $E_{\\text{tilted}}$, is proportional to the cosine of the local solar incidence angle $i$. Let $E_{\\text{direct}}$ be the direct solar irradiance at the surface after atmospheric attenuation. Then:\n$$E_{\\text{tilted}} = E_{\\text{direct}} \\cos i$$\nThus, the radiance leaving the tilted surface is:\n$$L = \\frac{\\rho_{\\text{true}}}{\\pi} (E_{\\text{direct}} \\cos i)$$\nIn remote sensing, the observed or apparent reflectance, $R_{\\text{obs}}$, is often calculated by normalizing the measured radiance $L$ by the solar irradiance that would be incident on a horizontal surface, $E_{\\text{horiz}}$. This is because the terrain is often assumed to be flat by default during initial data processing.\nThe irradiance on a hypothetical horizontal surface at the same location is:\n$$E_{\\text{horiz}} = E_{\\text{direct}} \\cos \\theta_s$$\nThe apparent reflectance $R_{\\text{obs}}$ is then defined as:\n$$R_{\\text{obs}} = \\frac{\\pi L}{E_{\\text{horiz}}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $L$ and $E_{\\text{horiz}}$ into this equation gives:\n$$R_{\\text{obs}} = \\frac{\\pi}{E_{\\text{direct}} \\cos \\theta_s} \\left( \\frac{\\rho_{\\text{true}}}{\\pi} E_{\\text{direct}} \\cos i \\right)$$\nThe terms $\\pi$ and $E_{\\text{direct}}$ cancel, yielding the relationship between the apparent reflectance and the intrinsic reflectance:\n$$R_{\\text{obs}} = \\rho_{\\text{true}} \\frac{\\cos i}{\\cos \\theta_s}$$\nThe problem defines the terrain-normalized reflectance as $R_{\\text{corr}}$, which is our $\\rho_{\\text{true}}$. Therefore, we solve for $R_{\\text{corr}}$:\n$$R_{\\text{corr}} = R_{\\text{obs}} \\frac{\\cos \\theta_s}{\\cos i}$$\nThis is the required expression for the terrain-normalized reflectance.\n\n### Part 2: Numerical Calculation of $R_{\\text{corr}}$\nWe are given $R_{obs} = 0.12$, $\\theta_s = 35^{\\circ}$, and $\\cos i = 0.6$. The value $R_{obs} = 0.12$ is the mean of the noisy measurement. We first calculate the mean of the corrected reflectance, $\\mu_{\\text{corr}}$.\nFirst, we find the value of $\\cos \\theta_s$:\n$$\\cos(35^{\\circ}) \\approx 0.819152$$\nNow, we substitute the given values into the derived expression:\n$$\\mu_{\\text{corr}} = 0.12 \\times \\frac{\\cos(35^{\\circ})}{0.6} \\approx 0.12 \\times \\frac{0.819152}{0.6} \\approx 0.1638304$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the estimated terrain-normalized reflectance is $0.1638$.\n\n### Part 3: Probabilistic Analysis\nThe observed reflectance $R_{obs}$ is modeled as a Gaussian random variable, which we denote $\\mathcal{R}_{\\text{obs}}$, with mean $\\mu_{R} = 0.12$ and standard deviation $\\sigma_{R} = 0.05$.\n$$\\mathcal{R}_{\\text{obs}} \\sim N(\\mu_{R}, \\sigma_{R}^2)$$\nThe corrected reflectance, $\\mathcal{R}_{\\text{corr}}$, is a linear transformation of $\\mathcal{R}_{\\text{obs}}$:\n$$\\mathcal{R}_{\\text{corr}} = \\mathcal{R}_{\\text{obs}} \\left( \\frac{\\cos \\theta_s}{\\cos i} \\right)$$\nLet the correction coefficient be $C = \\frac{\\cos \\theta_s}{\\cos i}$.\n$$C = \\frac{\\cos(35^{\\circ})}{0.6} \\approx \\frac{0.819152}{0.6} \\approx 1.36525$$\nSince $\\mathcal{R}_{\\text{corr}}$ is a linear transformation of a Gaussian random variable, it is also a Gaussian random variable. Its mean, $\\mu_{\\text{corr}}$, and standard deviation, $\\sigma_{\\text{corr}}$, are given by:\n$$\\mu_{\\text{corr}} = C \\mu_{R} \\approx 1.36525 \\times 0.12 \\approx 0.16383$$\n$$\\sigma_{\\text{corr}} = |C| \\sigma_{R} \\approx 1.36525 \\times 0.05 \\approx 0.0682625$$\nSo, the corrected reflectance is distributed as $\\mathcal{R}_{\\text{corr}} \\sim N(\\mu_{\\text{corr}} = 0.16383, \\sigma_{\\text{corr}}^2 = 0.0682625^2)$.\n\nWe need to compute the probability that $\\mathcal{R}_{\\text{corr}}$ lies within the physically meaningful interval $[0, 1]$:\n$$P(0 \\le \\mathcal{R}_{\\text{corr}} \\le 1)$$\nTo do this, we standardize the variable $\\mathcal{R}_{\\text{corr}}$ to a standard normal variable $Z \\sim N(0, 1)$, where $Z = (\\mathcal{R}_{\\text{corr}} - \\mu_{\\text{corr}}) / \\sigma_{\\text{corr}}$.\nThe probability becomes:\n$$P\\left( \\frac{0 - \\mu_{\\text{corr}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{corr}}} \\le Z \\le \\frac{1 - \\mu_{\\text{corr}}}{\\sigma_{\\text{corr}}} \\right)$$\nLet's calculate the standardized lower and upper bounds, $z_1$ and $z_2$:\n$$z_1 = \\frac{0 - 0.16383}{0.0682625} \\approx -2.3999$$\n$$z_2 = \\frac{1 - 0.16383}{0.0682625} = \\frac{0.83617}{0.0682625} \\approx 12.249$$\nThe probability is given by $\\Phi(z_2) - \\Phi(z_1)$, where $\\Phi$ is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution.\n$$P(-2.3999 \\le Z \\le 12.249) = \\Phi(12.249) - \\Phi(-2.3999)$$\nThe value of $\\Phi(12.249)$ is extremely close to $1$. The value of $\\Phi(-2.3999)$ can be found using standard normal tables or a computational function.\n$$\\Phi(-2.3999) \\approx 0.008198$$\nTherefore, the probability is:\n$$P \\approx 1 - 0.008198 = 0.991802$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the probability is $0.9918$.\n\nThe final results, rounded to four significant figures, are:\n- Terrain-normalized reflectance $R_{corr}$: $0.1638$.\n- Probability $P(0 \\le R_{corr} \\le 1)$: $0.9918$.",

            "problem": "In mountainous terrain, variation in local illumination due to slope and aspect modifies the apparent surface reflectance recorded by a nadir-viewing optical sensor. Consider a single spectral band of a sensor calibrated to surface reflectance. Let the Sun be characterized by the solar zenith angle $\\theta_{s}$, and let a pixel’s local incidence angle $i$ be the angle between the surface normal and the illumination direction. Angles are measured in radians, and their cosines are dimensionless.

A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Terrain Normalization**\n\nThe objective is to find a normalized reflectance, $R_{N}$, that represents the reflectance of the observed surface as if it were horizontal (flat).

A specific pixel's observed reflectance, $R_{\\text{obs}}$, may deviate from this model due to intrinsic variations in surface properties (e.g., moisture, density) that are unrelated to topography.\n\nWe can model this intrinsic variability as a multiplicative factor, $f_{\\text{int}}$, which scales the model reflectance:\n$$R_{\\text{obs}} = f_{\\text{int}} \\cdot (a \\cos i + b)$$\nThis factor $f_{\\text{int}} = \\frac{R_{\\text{obs}}}{a \\cos i + b}$ represents how much brighter or darker the specific pixel is compared to the 'average' or 'ideal' pixel described by the regression line.\n\nThe goal of terrain normalization is to remove the topographic effect (related to $\\cos i$) while preserving this intrinsic variability. The normalized reflectance $R_N$ should correspond to the reflectance the same pixel would have if it were on a flat surface, i.e., where the incidence angle is $\\theta_s$. We achieve this by applying the intrinsic factor $f_{\\text{int}}$ to the model reflectance for a flat surface:\n$$R_N = f_{\\text{int}} \\cdot R_{\\text{model}}(\\cos \\theta_s)$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $f_{\\text{int}}$ and $R_{\\text{model}}(\\cos \\theta_s)$:\n$$R_N = \\left( \\frac{R_{\\text{obs}}}{a \\cos i + b} \\right) \\cdot (a \\cos \\theta_s + b)$$\nRearranging this equation gives a multiplicative correction on $R_{\\text{obs}}$:\n$$R_N = R_{\\text{obs}} \\left( \\frac{a \\cos \\theta_s + b}{a \\cos i + b} \\right)$$\nThis is the desired terrain normalization formula. Let's verify it against the problem's constraints:\n1.  It is multiplicative on $R_{\\text{obs}}$, with the correction factor $K = \\frac{a \\cos \\theta_s + b}{a \\cos i + b}$.\n2.

The thresholding rule is to mask pixels that do not satisfy this condition, i.e., where $c  1/\\sqrt{\\alpha}$. Therefore, the minimum acceptable cosine factor is:\n$$ c_{\\min} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of $c_{\\min}$ for a user-specified tolerance of $\\alpha = 3.2$.\n$$ c_{\\min} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3.2}} $$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$ c_{\\min} \\approx \\frac{1}{1.78885438} \\approx 0.55901699 $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested gives $0.5590$. This means that to ensure the variance of the corrected reflectance is no more than $3.2$ times its ideal value, all pixels with an illumination factor less than $0.5590$ (corresponding to a solar incidence angle $i  \\arccos(0.5590) \\approx 56.0^{\\circ}$) must be masked.",
