            "solution": "The problem has been validated and is deemed sound. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution. The provided parameters are physically realistic for InSAR observations of coseismic deformation. The tasks require deriving fundamental relationships from first principles, which is a valid and instructive exercise.\n\nThe solution is presented in two parts, corresponding to the two tasks requested for each test case. All derivations are based on the principles provided in the problem statement.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Number of Fringes ($N$)\n\nThe relationship between the phase $\\phi$ of an electromagnetic wave, its travel path length $r$, and its wavelength $\\lambda$ is given as proportional. The standard physical relation for a full cycle of $2\\pi$ radians is:\n$$ \\phi = 2\\pi \\frac{r}{\\lambda} $$\nIn repeat-pass Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), the sensor measures the phase difference $\\Delta\\phi$ between two acquisitions. This phase difference is caused by a change in the line-of-sight (LOS) distance between the satellite and a point on the ground. A change in the LOS distance, let's call it $d_{los}$, alters the round-trip path length of the radar signal. The signal travels from the satellite to the ground and back, so the total path length change is twice the LOS displacement, i.e., $2d_{los}$.\n\nThe interferometric phase difference $\\Delta\\phi$ is therefore related to the LOS displacement $d_{los}$ by:\n$$ \\Delta\\phi = 2\\pi \\frac{2d_{los}}{\\lambda} = \\frac{4\\pi d_{los}}{\\lambda} $$\nThe problem defines a fringe as a $2\\pi$ phase cycle. The total number of fringes, $N$, across a deforming area is the total accumulated phase change, $\\Delta\\phi_{total}$, divided by $2\\pi$. The problem specifies a maximum LOS displacement magnitude of $s$, which represents the total displacement across the fault shear zone. The total phase change associated with this displacement $s$ is:\n$$ \\Delta\\phi_{max} = \\frac{4\\pi s}{\\lambda} $$\nThus, the total number of fringes $N$ is calculated as:\n$$ N = \\frac{\\Delta\\phi_{max}}{2\\pi} = \\frac{4\\pi s / \\lambda}{2\\pi} $$\nThis simplifies to the final expression for the number of fringes:\n$$ N = \\frac{2s}{\\lambda} $$\nThis value is dimensionless. For each test case, we will compute $N$ using the provided values of $s$ and $\\lambda$ and round the result to six decimal places.\n\n### Part 2: Derivation of the Unwrapping Feasibility Criterion\n\nPhase unwrapping aims to reconstruct the original, continuous phase field from its wrapped representation, which is confined to the interval $(-\\pi, \\pi]$. Aliasing occurs when the phase gradient is too steep, causing the phase difference between adjacent samples to exceed half a cycle ($\\pi$ radians). This leads to an ambiguity in the number of $2\\pi$ cycles to add or subtract.\n\nThe problem provides a sufficient condition to avoid aliasing: the maximum magnitude of the interferometric phase difference between adjacent pixels, $\\Delta\\phi_{adj}$, must be strictly less than $\\pi$ radians.\n$$ |\\Delta\\phi_{adj}|_{max} < \\pi $$\nWe need to find an expression for $|\\Delta\\phi_{adj}|_{max}$. The problem assumes an idealized deformation model where the LOS displacement $d_{los}$ varies linearly from $0$ to $s$ over a shear zone of width $W$. Within this zone, the displacement gradient is constant and at its maximum value. Let $x$ be the coordinate perpendicular to the fault trace. The displacement gradient is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial d_{los}}{\\partial x} = \\frac{s}{W} $$\nOutside the shear zone, the displacement is constant, and the gradient is $0$.\n\nThe phase gradient is related to the displacement gradient:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( \\frac{4\\pi d_{los}(x)}{\\lambda} \\right) = \\frac{4\\pi}{\\lambda} \\frac{\\partial d_{los}}{\\partial x} $$\nThe maximum phase gradient occurs within the shear zone:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial x} \\right)_{max} = \\frac{4\\pi}{\\lambda} \\frac{s}{W} = \\frac{4\\pi s}{\\lambda W} $$\nThe phase difference between two adjacent pixels separated by a spacing $p$ can be approximated using a first-order Taylor expansion (or finite difference), assuming the gradient is constant over the distance $p$:\n$$ \\Delta\\phi_{adj} \\approx \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial x} \\cdot p $$\nThe maximum phase difference between adjacent pixels, $|\\Delta\\phi_{adj}|_{max}$, will occur where the phase gradient is maximum:\n$$ |\\Delta\\phi_{adj}|_{max} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial x} \\right)_{max} \\cdot p = \\left( \\frac{4\\pi s}{\\lambda W} \\right) p $$\nApplying the aliasing condition:\n$$ \\frac{4\\pi s p}{\\lambda W} < \\pi $$\nDividing by $\\pi$ (since $\\pi > 0$), we arrive at the criterion for aliasing-free unwrapping:\n$$ \\frac{4sp}{\\lambda W} < 1 $$\nFor each test case, we will evaluate this inequality using the provided values of $s$, $p$, $\\lambda$, and $W$. The result is a boolean value indicating whether unwrapping is feasible without aliasing under the given model and sampling.\n\n### Summary of Formulas for Computation\n\nFor each test case $(\\lambda, s, W, p)$:\n1.  Number of fringes: $N = \\frac{2s}{\\lambda}$\n2.  Unwrapping feasibility: `True` if $\\frac{4sp}{\\lambda W} < 1$, `False` otherwise.",

            "problem": "An Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) observation of a tropical rainforest is conducted in repeat-pass mode at L-band. The two Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) acquisitions are separated by a time interval of $\\Delta t = 3$ days with a short perpendicular baseline such that geometric decorrelation is negligible. Atmospheric phase and thermal noise contributions are negligible and identical across polarizations. The total backscattered complex field at a given polarization is the sum of mutually uncorrelated scattering components: surface, double-bounce, and vegetation volume. Each component undergoes temporal decorrelation that can be modeled as a stationary first-order process with a characteristic time constant, leading to a coherence magnitude that depends on $\\Delta t$ and the component’s time constant. The forest canopy is old-growth and structurally complex, with the following physically plausible polarization-dependent fractional power contributions (normalized to sum to $1$):\n\n- For horizontal transmit, horizontal receive ($\\mathrm{HH}$): $f_{\\mathrm{vol}} = 0.50$, $f_{\\mathrm{db}} = 0.40$, $f_{\\mathrm{s}} = 0.10$.\n- For horizontal transmit, vertical receive ($\\mathrm{HV}$): $f_{\\mathrm{vol}} = 0.90$, $f_{\\mathrm{db}} = 0.05$, $f_{\\mathrm{s}} = 0.05$.\n- For vertical transmit, vertical receive ($\\mathrm{VV}$): $f_{\\mathrm{vol}} = 0.70$, $f_{\\mathrm{db}} = 0.10$, $f_{\\mathrm{s}} = 0.20$.\n\nHere, $f_{\\mathrm{vol}}$ denotes the vegetation volume fraction, $f_{\\mathrm{db}}$ the double-bounce (ground–trunk) fraction, and $f_{\\mathrm{s}}$ the surface (ground) fraction. The component-specific temporal coherences are governed by exponential decay with characteristic time constants representative of rainforest dynamics: $\\tau_{\\mathrm{vol}} = 1.5$ days, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{db}} = 7$ days, and $\\tau_{\\mathrm{s}} = 10$ days. Assume the total intensity is unchanged between the two dates for each polarization.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definition of complex interferometric coherence and basic scattering physics, derive an expression for the expected interferometric coherence magnitude for each polarization in terms of $\\Delta t$, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{vol}}$, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{db}}$, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{s}}$, and the fractional power contributions.

            "solution": "The problem is subjected to validation and is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a complete and consistent setup for a standard problem in radar remote sensing.\n\nThe solution proceeds by first deriving a general expression for the interferometric coherence magnitude under the given scattering model and then applying it to compute the specific numerical values for each polarization.\n\nThe fundamental definition of the complex interferometric coherence, $\\gamma$, between two complex synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, $E_1$ and $E_2$, acquired at two different times is given by:\n$$\n\\gamma = \\frac{\\langle E_1 E_2^* \\rangle}{\\sqrt{\\langle |E_1|^2 \\rangle \\langle |E_2|^2 \\rangle}}\n$$\nwhere $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle$ denotes the spatial ensemble average over a processing window, and $E^*$ is the complex conjugate of $E$.\n\nThe problem states that the total backscattered complex field, $E$, for any given polarization is the sum of three mutually uncorrelated scattering components: volume ($E_{\\mathrm{vol}}$), double-bounce ($E_{\\mathrm{db}}$), and surface ($E_{\\mathrm{s}}$). Thus, for the two acquisitions, we have:\n$$\nE_1 = E_{\\mathrm{vol},1} + E_{\\mathrm{db},1} + E_{\\mathrm{s},1}\n$$\n$$\nE_2 = E_{\\mathrm{vol},2} + E_{\\mathrm{db},2} + E_{\\mathrm{s},2}\n$$\nThe property of mutual uncorrelation implies that the cross-correlation of different components is zero, i.e., $\\langle E_{i,m} E_{j,n}^* \\rangle = 0$ for $i \\neq j$, where $i, j \\in \\{\\mathrm{vol}, \\mathrm{db}, \\mathrm{s}\\}$ and $m, n \\in \\{1, 2\\}$.\n\nLet us expand the numerator of the coherence expression:\n$$\n\\langle E_1 E_2^* \\rangle = \\langle (E_{\\mathrm{vol},1} + E_{\\mathrm{db},1} + E_{\\mathrm{s},1}) (E_{\\mathrm{vol},2}^* + E_{\\mathrm{db},2}^* + E_{\\mathrm{s},2}^*) \\rangle\n$$\nDue to the uncorrelation of the components, all cross-terms vanish upon averaging. The expression simplifies to the sum of the autocorrelations of the individual components:\n$$\n\\langle E_1 E_2^* \\rangle = \\langle E_{\\mathrm{vol},1} E_{\\mathrm{vol},2}^* \\rangle + \\langle E_{\\mathrm{db},1} E_{\\mathrm{db},2}^* \\rangle + \\langle E_{\\mathrm{s},1} E_{\\mathrm{s},2}^* \\rangle\n$$\nNow, we analyze the denominator. It contains the total power (intensity) from each acquisition. The problem states that the total intensity is unchanged, so $\\langle |E_1|^2 \\rangle = \\langle |E_2|^2 \\rangle$. Let's denote the total power as $\\sigma^0_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\langle |E|^2 \\rangle$.\n$$\n\\sigma^0_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\langle |E_1|^2 \\rangle = \\langle |E_{\\mathrm{vol},1} + E_{\\mathrm{db},1} + E_{\\mathrm{s},1}|^2 \\rangle\n$$\nExpanding this and using the uncorrelation property again, we find that the total power is the sum of the powers of the individual components:\n$$\n\\sigma^0_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\langle |E_{\\mathrm{vol},1}|^2 \\rangle + \\langle |E_{\\mathrm{db},1}|^2 \\rangle + \\langle |E_{\\mathrm{s},1}|^2 \\rangle = \\sigma^0_{\\mathrm{vol}} + \\sigma^0_{\\mathrm{db}} + \\sigma^0_{\\mathrm{s}}\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma^0_i$ is the backscattered power of component $i$. The denominator of the coherence expression thus becomes $\\sqrt{(\\sigma^0_{\\mathrm{total}})^2} = \\sigma^0_{\\mathrm{total}}$.\n\nSubstituting these expanded forms for the numerator and denominator, we get:\n$$\n\\gamma = \\frac{\\langle E_{\\mathrm{vol},1} E_{\\mathrm{vol},2}^* \\rangle + \\langle E_{\\mathrm{db},1} E_{\\mathrm{db},2}^* \\rangle + \\langle E_{\\mathrm{s},1} E_{\\mathrm{s},2}^* \\rangle}{\\sigma^0_{\\mathrm{vol}} + \\sigma^0_{\\mathrm{db}} + \\sigma^0_{\\mathrm{s}}}\n$$\nThe complex coherence of an individual component $i$ is defined as $\\gamma_i = \\frac{\\langle E_{i,1} E_{i,2}^* \\rangle}{\\sqrt{\\langle |E_{i,1}|^2 \\rangle \\langle |E_{i,2}|^2 \\rangle}}$. Since the process is stationary, $\\langle |E_{i,1}|^2 \\rangle = \\langle |E_{i,2}|^2 \\rangle = \\sigma^0_i$. Therefore, we can write the interferometric cross-correlation for each component as $\\langle E_{i,1} E_{i,2}^* \\rangle = \\gamma_i \\sigma^0_i$. Substituting this into our expression for the total coherence $\\gamma$:\n$$\n\\gamma = \\frac{\\gamma_{\\mathrm{vol}}\\sigma^0_{\\mathrm{vol}} + \\gamma_{\\mathrm{db}}\\sigma^0_{\\mathrm{db}} + \\gamma_{\\mathrm{s}}\\sigma^0_{\\mathrm{s}}}{\\sigma^0_{\\mathrm{total}}}\n$$\nThe problem provides fractional power contributions, $f_i = \\sigma^0_i / \\sigma^0_{\\mathrm{total}}$. Using this definition, the total complex coherence becomes a weighted sum of the component complex coherences:\n$$\n\\gamma = f_{\\mathrm{vol}}\\gamma_{\\mathrm{vol}} + f_{\\mathrm{db}}\\gamma_{\\mathrm{db}} + f_{\\mathrm{s}}\\gamma_{\\mathrm{s}}\n$$\nEach component complex coherence $\\gamma_i$ includes effects of temporal decorrelation and a phase term related to the vertical location of the scatterer. However, the problem focuses on temporal decorrelation and provides no information to determine the phase differences between scattering components (which depend on forest height and baseline). A common and justified simplification in such models, when not explicitly solving for vertical structure, is to assume that the phase contributions are either negligible or aligned, allowing the total coherence *magnitude* to be approximated by the weighted sum of the component temporal coherence magnitudes. This is the model we will adopt.\n$$\n|\\gamma| \\approx f_{\\mathrm{vol}}|\\gamma_{\\mathrm{vol}}| + f_{\\mathrm{db}}|\\gamma_{\\mathrm{db}}| + f_{\\mathrm{s}}|\\gamma_{\\mathrm{s}}|\n$$\nThe problem states that temporal decorrelation for each component follows a stationary first-order process, which corresponds to an exponential decay model for the coherence magnitude, $|\\gamma_i|$. With negligible geometric, thermal, and atmospheric decorrelation, the coherence of each component is dominated by temporal decorrelation:\n$$\n|\\gamma_i| = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_i}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta t$ is the repeat-pass time interval and $\\tau_i$ is the characteristic decorrelation time constant for component $i$.\n\nThus, the final expression for the expected interferometric coherence magnitude is:\n$$\n|\\gamma| = f_{\\mathrm{vol}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{vol}}}\\right) + f_{\\mathrm{db}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{db}}}\\right) + f_{\\mathrm{s}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{s}}}\\right)\n$$\nWe now compute the numerical values using the given data: $\\Delta t = 3$ days, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{vol}} = 1.5$ days, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{db}} = 7$ days, and $\\tau_{\\mathrm{s}} = 10$ days.\n\nFirst, we calculate the component coherence magnitudes:\n$|\\gamma_{\\mathrm{vol}}| = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{3}{1.5}\\right) = \\exp(-2) \\approx 0.135335$\n$|\\gamma_{\\mathrm{db}}| = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{3}{7}\\right) \\approx 0.651430$\n$|\\gamma_{\\mathrm{s}}| = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{3}{10}\\right) = \\exp(-0.3) \\approx 0.740818$\n\nNext, we compute the total coherence magnitude for each polarization using its specific fractional power contributions.\n\nFor HH polarization ($f_{\\mathrm{vol}} = 0.50$, $f_{\\mathrm{db}} = 0.40$, $f_{\\mathrm{s}} = 0.10$):\n$|\\gamma_{\\mathrm{HH}}| = 0.50 \\times |\\gamma_{\\mathrm{vol}}| + 0.40 \\times |\\gamma_{\\mathrm{db}}| + 0.10 \\times |\\gamma_{\\mathrm{s}}|$\n$|\\gamma_{\\mathrm{HH}}| \\approx 0.50(0.135335) + 0.40(0.651430) + 0.10(0.740818)$\n$|\\gamma_{\\mathrm{HH}}| \\approx 0.067668 + 0.260572 + 0.074082 = 0.402322$\nRounded to three significant figures, $|\\gamma_{\\mathrm{HH}}| \\approx 0.402$.\n\nFor HV polarization ($f_{\\mathrm{vol}} = 0.90$, $f_{\\mathrm{db}} = 0.05$, $f_{\\mathrm{s}} = 0.05$):\n$|\\gamma_{\\mathrm{HV}}| = 0.90 \\times |\\gamma_{\\mathrm{vol}}| + 0.05 \\times |\\gamma_{\\mathrm{db}}| + 0.05 \\times |\\gamma_{\\mathrm{s}}|$\n$|\\gamma_{\\mathrm{HV}}| \\approx 0.90(0.135335) + 0.05(0.651430) + 0.05(0.740818)$\n$|\\gamma_{\\mathrm{HV}}| \\approx 0.121802 + 0.032572 + 0.037041 = 0.191415$\nRounded to three significant figures, $|\\gamma_{\\mathrm{HV}}| \\approx 0.191$.\n\nFor VV polarization ($f_{\\mathrm{vol}} = 0.70$, $f_{\\mathrm{db}} = 0.10$, $f_{\\mathrm{s}} = 0.20$):\n$|\\gamma_{\\mathrm{VV}}| = 0.70 \\times |\\gamma_{\\mathrm{vol}}| + 0.10 \\times |\\gamma_{\\mathrm{db}}| + 0.20 \\times |\\gamma_{\\mathrm{s}}|$\n$|\\gamma_{\\mathrm{VV}}| \\approx 0.70(0.135335) + 0.10(0.651430) + 0.20(0.740818)$\n$|\\gamma_{\\mathrm{VV}}| \\approx 0.094735 + 0.065143 + 0.148164 = 0.308042$\nRounded to three significant figures, $|\\gamma_{\\mathrm{VV}}| \\approx 0.308$.\n\nFinally, we justify which polarization has the highest coherence. The calculated values are $|\\gamma_{\\mathrm{HH}}| \\approx 0.402$, $|\\gamma_{\\mathrm{HV}}| \\approx 0.191$, and $|\\gamma_{\\mathrm{VV}}| \\approx 0.308$. The HH polarization yields the highest coherence.\n\nThis result is physically justified. The temporal coherence of the scattering components is ordered as follows, based on their time constants: $|\\gamma_{\\mathrm{vol}}|  |\\gamma_{\\mathrm{db}}|  |\\gamma_{\\mathrm{s}}|$. The volume component (canopy leaves and small branches) is the most dynamic and decorrelates fastest, while the surface and double-bounce components (involving the ground and tree trunks) are more stable. The total coherence is a weighted average of these component coherences.\n- The HV channel is dominated by volume scattering ($f_{\\mathrm{vol, HV}} = 0.90$), which is the least stable component, resulting in the lowest overall coherence. This is characteristic of cross-polarization in vegetated areas.\n- The VV channel has a large but smaller volume contribution ($f_{\\mathrm{vol, VV}} = 0.70$) and a more significant contribution from the stable surface component ($f_{\\mathrm{s, VV}} = 0.20$).\n- The HH channel has the smallest contribution from the unstable volume component ($f_{\\mathrm{vol, HH}} = 0.50$) and the largest contribution from the moderately stable double-bounce component ($f_{\\mathrm{db, HH}} = 0.40$).\nThe HH polarization's sensitivity to the relatively stable dihedral scattering from ground-trunk interactions, which is significant in forests, especially at L-band, allows it to maintain higher coherence compared to VV and HV. Therefore, the HH polarization is expected to have the highest coherence, a conclusion that is borne out by the calculation.",

            "introduction": "In practical applications, the subtle phase signature of ground deformation is often buried under much larger, spatially-correlated noise from the atmosphere. This advanced practice simulates a common and critical task: designing an observation strategy to reliably separate a deterministic tectonic signal from random atmospheric effects. By leveraging the statistical properties of stacking, you will determine the number of measurements needed to achieve a confident detection, a core skill in modern time-series InSAR analysis.",

            "problem": "A coastal lowland dominated by evergreen forest shows a quasi-linear line-of-sight phase gradient in Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) products. To test whether this gradient is caused by atmospheric delay structure or tectonic deformation, you will design an experiment that manipulates acquisition timing and stacking strategy. Work from first principles of the InSAR phase observable and basic statistical properties of correlated random fields.\n\nAssume the interferometric phase at position $x$ and time $t$ can be modeled as\n$$\n\\phi(x,t) = \\frac{4\\pi}{\\lambda}\\,u_{\\mathrm{LOS}}(x,t) + \\phi_{\\mathrm{atm}}(x,t) + \\phi_{\\mathrm{noise}}(x,t),\n$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the radar wavelength, $u_{\\mathrm{LOS}}$ is the line-of-sight displacement, $\\phi_{\\mathrm{atm}}$ is the tropospheric delay phase, and $\\phi_{\\mathrm{noise}}$ includes instrument and residual volume decorrelation effects. Consider the spatial phase gradient $g(x,t) = \\partial \\phi(x,t)/\\partial x$ measured over gently varying topography where residual topographic phase has been removed.\n\nYou will implement two stacks of interferograms over the same area:\n\n- A “matched-time” stack constructed from interferograms whose acquisitions are aligned to within $\\pm 10$ minutes of the same local time and within the same season window; this stack is designed to preserve atmospheric correlation.\n- A “random-time” stack constructed from interferograms whose acquisitions span the diurnal cycle broadly and multiple seasons; this stack is designed to minimize atmospheric correlation across interferograms.\n\nAssume the following physically plausible parameters:\n\n- Radar wavelength $\\lambda = 0.056\\,\\mathrm{m}$ (C-band).\n- Line-of-sight projection coefficient $c_{\\mathrm{LOS}} = 0.8$ for the regional strain geometry.\n- Uniform horizontal strain rate $\\epsilon = 5.0\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ producing a constant displacement gradient $\\partial u/\\partial x = \\epsilon\\,\\Delta t$ over an interferometric time separation $\\Delta t$.\n- Interferometric time separation $\\Delta t = 24$ days $= \\frac{24}{365.25}\\,\\mathrm{yr}$ for each interferogram in the stacks.\n- Atmospheric phase gradient per interferogram modeled as a zero-mean Gaussian random variable $a_i$ with variance $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{atm}}^{2}$ and equicorrelation $\\rho$ between distinct interferograms in a stack; take $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{atm}} = 0.08\\,\\mathrm{rad/km}$ and, for the random-time stack, $\\rho = 0.005$.\n- Instrumental plus residual volume decorrelation gradient per interferogram modeled as a zero-mean Gaussian random variable $n_i$ independent across interferograms with variance $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{instr}}^{2}$; take $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{instr}} = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{rad/km}$.\n\nLet $g_i$ denote the measured gradient for the $i$-th interferogram in the random-time stack, with $g_i = g_{\\mathrm{def}} + a_i + n_i$ and $g_{\\mathrm{def}}$ the deterministic deformation-induced phase gradient. Using the random-time stack mean $\\bar{g} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} g_i$, you will set a detection criterion based on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), requiring\n$$\n\\mathrm{SNR} = \\frac{|g_{\\mathrm{def}}|}{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{g})}} \\geq 4.\n$$\n\nStarting from the definitions above and using only well-tested facts about phase-to-displacement conversion and the variance of a mean under equicorrelation, derive $g_{\\mathrm{def}}$ for the given $\\epsilon$, $\\Delta t$, $c_{\\mathrm{LOS}}$, and $\\lambda$, and derive $\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{g})$ for the random-time stack in terms of $N$, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{atm}}$, $\\rho$, and $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{instr}}$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a complete and consistent set of parameters to solve a formal problem in InSAR time-series analysis, which is directly relevant to the specified topic. All given values are physically plausible. The problem is a standard signal-detection exercise rooted in the fundamental principles of interferometry and statistical signal processing. Therefore, a solution will be derived.\n\nThe objective is to find the minimum number of interferograms, $N_{\\min}$, for the random-time stack such that the signal-to-noise ratio ($\\mathrm{SNR}$) for the mean phase gradient, $\\bar{g}$, is at least $4$. The $\\mathrm{SNR}$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{SNR} = \\frac{|g_{\\mathrm{def}}|}{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{g})}} \\geq 4\n$$\nThis requires deriving expressions for the deterministic deformation gradient, $g_{\\mathrm{def}}$, and the variance of the mean gradient, $\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{g})$.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the deformation-induced phase gradient, $g_{\\mathrm{def}}$. The phase component due to deformation is given by the first term in the provided model:\n$$\n\\phi_{\\mathrm{def}}(x,t) = \\frac{4\\pi}{\\lambda}\\,u_{\\mathrm{LOS}}(x,t)\n$$\nThe corresponding phase gradient, $g_{\\mathrm{def}}$, is the spatial derivative of this term:\n$$\ng_{\\mathrm{def}} = \\frac{\\partial \\phi_{\\mathrm{def}}}{\\partial x} = \\frac{4\\pi}{\\lambda}\\,\\frac{\\partial u_{\\mathrm{LOS}}}{\\partial x}\n$$\nThe problem states that a uniform horizontal strain rate, $\\epsilon$, produces a horizontal displacement gradient $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = \\epsilon\\,\\Delta t$ over the interferometric time baseline $\\Delta t$. The line-of-sight projection coefficient, $c_{\\mathrm{LOS}}$, relates the horizontal displacement gradient to the line-of-sight displacement gradient. Thus, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u_{\\mathrm{LOS}}}{\\partial x} = c_{\\mathrm{LOS}}\\,\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = c_{\\mathrm{LOS}}\\,\\epsilon\\,\\Delta t\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $g_{\\mathrm{def}}$ yields:\n$$\ng_{\\mathrm{def}} = \\frac{4\\pi}{\\lambda}\\,c_{\\mathrm{LOS}}\\,\\epsilon\\,\\Delta t\n$$\n\nNext, we derive the variance of the mean gradient, $\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{g})$. The measured gradient for the $i$-th interferogram is $g_i = g_{\\mathrm{def}} + a_i + n_i$, where $g_{\\mathrm{def}}$ is a constant, $a_i$ is the atmospheric phase gradient, and $n_i$ is the instrumental and decorrelation noise gradient. The mean gradient over $N$ interferograms is:\n$$\n\\bar{g} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} g_i = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (g_{\\mathrm{def}} + a_i + n_i) = g_{\\mathrm{def}} + \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} a_i + \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} n_i\n$$\nThe variance of $\\bar{g}$ is the variance of the stochastic part:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{g}) = \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} a_i + \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} n_i\\right)\n$$\nSince the atmospheric noise terms ($a_i$) and the instrumental noise terms ($n_i$) are independent, the variance of their sum is the sum of their variances:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{g}) = \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} a_i\\right) + \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} n_i\\right) = \\frac{1}{N^2}\\left[\\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} a_i\\right) + \\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} n_i\\right)\\right]\n$$\nThe instrumental noise terms $n_i$ are independent with variance $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{instr}}^2$. Thus, the variance of their sum is the sum of their variances:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} n_i\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathrm{Var}(n_i) = N\\,\\sigma_{\\mathrm{instr}}^2\n$$\nThe atmospheric noise terms $a_i$ are zero-mean Gaussian random variables with variance $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{atm}}^2$ and equicorrelation $\\rho$ for any pair of distinct interferograms ($i \\neq j$). The variance of their sum is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} a_i\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\mathrm{Cov}(a_i, a_j) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathrm{Var}(a_i) + \\sum_{i \\neq j} \\mathrm{Cov}(a_i, a_j)\n$$\nThere are $N$ variance terms ($\\mathrm{Var}(a_i) = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{atm}}^2$) and $N(N-1)$ covariance terms. For $i \\neq j$, $\\mathrm{Cov}(a_i, a_j) = \\rho\\,\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(a_i)\\mathrm{Var}(a_j)} = \\rho\\,\\sigma_{\\mathrm{atm}}^2$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} a_i\\right) = N\\,\\sigma_{\\mathrm{atm}}^2 + N(N-1)\\,\\rho\\,\\sigma_{\\mathrm{atm}}^2 = N\\,\\sigma_{\\mathrm{atm}}^2\\,[1+(N-1)\\rho]\n$$\nSubstituting these back into the expression for $\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{g})$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{g}) = \\frac{1}{N^2} \\left[ N\\,\\sigma_{\\mathrm{atm}}^2\\,(1+(N-1)\\rho) + N\\,\\sigma_{\\mathrm{instr}}^2 \\right] = \\frac{1}{N} \\left[ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{atm}}^2\\,(1+(N-1)\\rho) + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{instr}}^2 \\right]\n$$\nThis expression can be rearranged to isolate the terms dependent on and independent of $N$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{g}) = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{atm}}^2(1-\\rho) + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{instr}}^2}{N} + \\rho\\,\\sigma_{\\mathrm{atm}}^2\n$$\nNow we use the $\\mathrm{SNR}$ condition:\n$$\n\\frac{g_{\\mathrm{def}}^2}{\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{g})} \\geq 16 \\implies g_{\\mathrm{def}}^2 \\geq 16\\,\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{g})\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\mathrm{Var}(\\bar{g})$:\n$$\ng_{\\mathrm{def}}^2 \\geq 16 \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{atm}}^2(1-\\rho) + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{instr}}^2}{N} + \\rho\\,\\sigma_{\\mathrm{atm}}^2 \\right)\n$$\nWe solve for $N$:\n$$\ng_{\\mathrm{def}}^2 - 16\\,\\rho\\,\\sigma_{\\mathrm{atm}}^2 \\geq \\frac{16}{N} \\left( \\sigma_{\\mathrm{atm}}^2(1-\\rho) + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{instr}}^2 \\right)\n$$\n$$\nN \\geq \\frac{16 \\left( \\sigma_{\\mathrm{atm}}^2(1-\\rho) + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{instr}}^2 \\right)}{g_{\\mathrm{def}}^2 - 16\\,\\rho\\,\\sigma_{\\mathrm{atm}}^2}\n$$\nThe minimum number of interferograms, $N_{\\min}$, is the smallest integer satisfying this inequality.\n\nFinally, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$\\lambda = 0.056\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$c_{\\mathrm{LOS}} = 0.8$\n$\\epsilon = 5.0\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$\n$\\Delta t = \\frac{24}{365.25}\\,\\mathrm{yr}$\n$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{atm}} = 0.08\\,\\mathrm{rad/km}$, so $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{atm}}^2 = 0.0064\\,\\mathrm{rad}^2/\\mathrm{km}^2$\n$\\sigma_{\\mathrm{instr}} = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{rad/km}$, so $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{instr}}^2 = 0.0004\\,\\mathrm{rad}^2/\\mathrm{km}^2$\n$\\rho = 0.005$\n\nFirst, compute $g_{\\mathrm{def}}$.
