The goal is to parameterize monthly Soil Conservation Service (SCS; now Natural Resources Conservation Service) curve number values from land cover and compute event runoff for a prescribed two-year sequence of design storm depths, then assess seasonality in runoff ratios. Build a program that performs these steps for multiple parameter sets and aggregates the results in a single-line output format.\n\nStart from fundamental base relationships and well-tested facts, and do not assume or use shortcut formulas as given. Use the following foundational bases:\n- Remote sensing reflectance-based vegetation index definition: the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is defined from spectral reflectance as $$\\mathrm{NDVI} = \\frac{\\rho_{\\mathrm{NIR}} - \\rho_{\\mathrm{R}}}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{NIR}} + \\rho_{\\mathrm{R}}}$$ where $\\rho_{\\mathrm{NIR}}$ is near-infrared reflectance and $\\rho_{\\mathrm{R}}$ is red reflectance. NDVI is a monotonic indicator of green vegetation amount and fractional vegetative cover under typical cropland conditions.\n- Hydrologic abstraction framework: the event water balance can be conceptualized as $$P = I_{\\mathrm{a}} + F + Q$$ where $P$ is precipitation depth, $I_{\\mathrm{a}}$ is initial abstraction, $F$ is actual infiltration plus other abstractions, and $Q$ is direct runoff depth. Under the SCS curve number method, the potential maximum retention and initial abstraction are related to land cover and soil properties. Adopt a standard initial abstraction coefficient $\\lambda$ equal to $0.2$.\n- Parameterization principle from land cover: fractional vegetative cover can be estimated from NDVI via a physically consistent linear mapping bounded by representative minimum and maximum NDVI for cropland. Use $\\mathrm{NDVI}_{\\min} = 0.15$ and $\\mathrm{NDVI}_{\\max} = 0.85$. Map NDVI to a fractional vegetation cover that is constrained to the interval $[0,1]$, and use this fractional vegetation cover to linearly interpolate monthly curve numbers between dormant-season and growing-season reference curve numbers for cropland on HSG C.\n- Reference curve numbers for cropland on HSG C under Antecedent Moisture Condition II (AMC II): use a dormant-season curve number $CN_{\\mathrm{d}} = 82$ and a growing-season curve number $CN_{\\mathrm{g}} = 74$.\n\nFor each parameter set, complete the following tasks:\n1. Convert the monthly NDVI climatology to monthly fractional vegetation cover using the specified bounds, then parameterize monthly curve numbers for cropland on HSG C via linear interpolation between $CN_{\\mathrm{d}}$ and $CN_{\\mathrm{g}}$ using the fractional vegetation cover. Ensure the resulting monthly curve numbers are bounded within physically plausible limits for HSG C cropland.\n2.

If an event yields no runoff consistent with the method’s conditions, return zero runoff for that event. Express all event runoff depths in $\\mathrm{mm}$, rounded to three decimal places.\n3. Compute the runoff ratio for each event as $Q/P$ (dimensionless) and assess seasonality via a threshold on NDVI. Classify months into growing-season if the monthly NDVI is greater than or equal to $0.5$, and dormant-season otherwise.

This is achieved through a two-step process: converting NDVI to fractional vegetation cover ($f_v$), and then interpolating the curve number based on $f_v$.\n\n1.  **From NDVI to Fractional Vegetation Cover ($f_v$)**: The problem posits a linear relationship between NDVI and $f_v$. Given a minimum NDVI value corresponding to bare soil ($\\mathrm{NDVI}_{\\min} = 0.15$) and a maximum NDVI value for full vegetation cover ($\\mathrm{NDVI}_{\\max} = 0.85$), the fractional cover $f_{v,i}$ for a given month $i$ is calculated as:\n    $$f_{v,i} = \\frac{\\mathrm{NDVI}_i - \\mathrm{NDVI}_{\\min}}{\\mathrm{NDVI}_{\\max} - \\mathrm{NDVI}_{\\min}}$$\n    Substituting the given constants, the equation becomes:\n    $$f_{v,i} = \\frac{\\mathrm{NDVI}_i - 0.15}{0.85 - 0.15} = \\frac{\\mathrm{NDVI}_i - 0.15}{0.70}$$\n    The problem specifies that $f_{v,i}$ must be constrained to the interval $[0, 1]$. The provided NDVI data for all test cases fall within the $[\\mathrm{NDVI}_{\\min}, \\mathrm{NDVI}_{\\max}]$ range, so the calculated $f_v$ will naturally be within $[0, 1]$ without explicit clamping.\n\n2.  **From Fractional Cover to Curve Number ($CN$)**: The monthly curve number, $CN_i$, is determined by linearly interpolating between a reference dormant-season curve number ($CN_{\\mathrm{d}} = 82$) and a growing-season curve number ($CN_{\\mathrm{g}} = 74$). The fractional cover, $f_{v,i}$, serves as the interpolation weight. The dormant season corresponds to $f_v = 0$ and the peak growing season to $f_v = 1$. The interpolation formula is:\n    $$CN_i = CN_{\\mathrm{d}} (1 - f_{v,i}) + CN_{\\mathrm{g}} f_{v,i} = CN_{\\mathrm{d}} + f_{v,i} (CN_{\\mathrm{g}} - CN_{\\mathrm{d}})$$\n    Substituting the reference values for cropland on Hydrologic Soil Group (HSG) C:\n    $$CN_i = 82 + f_{v,i} (74 - 82) = 82 - 8 f_{v,i}$$\n    This equation reflects the fact that for the specified cropland, increased vegetation cover (higher $f_v$) leads to a lower curve number, implying higher infiltration and lower runoff potential. The resulting $12$ monthly $CN_i$ values are rounded to one decimal place for the final output.\n\n**Part 2: Computation of Event Runoff Depth ($Q$)**\n\nWith a monthly $CN_i$ climatology, event runoff depth ($Q_j$) can be computed for a given sequence of $24$ monthly precipitation events ($P_j$) using the SCS-CN method.\n\n1.  **Potential Maximum Retention ($S$)**: The curve number is an index that is functionally related to the potential maximum soil moisture retention, $S$. The standard formula, with $S$ in inches, is $S = \\frac{1000}{CN} - 10$. Since precipitation is given in millimeters, we must convert $S$ to millimeters using the conversion factor $1 \\text{ inch} = 25.4 \\text{ mm}$.\n    $$S_i \\text{ [mm]} = 25.4 \\left( \\frac{1000}{CN_i} - 10 \\right)$$\n    This calculation is performed for each of the $12$ monthly curve numbers, using the unrounded $CN_i$ values to maintain precision. The 12-month climatology of $S_i$ is used for both years of the precipitation sequence.\n\n2.  **Initial Abstraction ($I_a$)**: Before runoff can occur, initial abstractions ($I_a$), which include interception, surface storage, and initial infiltration, must be satisfied. $I_a$ is modeled as a fraction of $S$.\n    $$I_{a,i} = \\lambda S_i$$\n    The problem specifies a standard initial abstraction coefficient $\\lambda = 0.2$.\n\n3.  **Runoff Depth ($Q$)**: The SCS-CN equation calculates the direct runoff depth $Q$ from precipitation $P$. Runoff is generated only when precipitation exceeds the initial abstraction, $P > I_a$.\n    $$Q_j = \\begin{cases} \\frac{(P_j - I_{a,i})^2}{P_j - I_{a,i} + S_i}  \\text{if } P_j > I_{a,i} \\\\ 0  \\text{if } P_j \\le I_{a,i} \\end{cases}$$\n    where $i = (j-1) \\pmod{12}$ for a 1-indexed event $j \\in \\{1, ..., 24\\}$. Substituting $I_{a,i} = 0.2 S_i$:\n    $$Q_j = \\frac{(P_j - 0.2 S_i)^2}{P_j + 0.8 S_i} \\quad \\text{for } P_j > 0.2 S_i$$\n    This calculation is performed for each of the $24$ precipitation events, using the $S_i$ value corresponding to the event's month. The resulting $24$ runoff depths $Q_j$ are rounded to three decimal places.\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of the Seasonality Index ($SI$)**\n\nThe final task is to quantify the seasonal difference in runoff response.\n\n1.  **Runoff Ratio ($R$)**: For each event, the runoff ratio $R_j$ is the dimensionless fraction of precipitation that becomes runoff:\n    $$R_j = \\frac{Q_j}{P_j}$$\n    This calculation is performed for all $24$ events.\n\n2.  **Seasonal Classification**: Months are classified based on their NDVI values.\n    -   Growing Season: if $\\mathrm{NDVI}_i \\ge 0.5$\n    -   Dormant Season: if $\\mathrm{NDVI}_i  0.5$\n\n3.  **Seasonality Index ($SI$)**: The $SI$ is the difference between the mean runoff-ratio of all growing-season events and the mean runoff-ratio of all dormant-season events.\n    Let $G_E$ be the set of runoff ratios for events occurring in growing-season months and $D_E$ be the set for events in dormant-season months.\n    $$\\overline{R}_{\\text{growing}} = \\frac{1}{|G_E|} \\sum_{R_j \\in G_E} R_j$$\n    $$\\overline{R}_{\\text{dormant}} = \\frac{1}{|D_E|} \\sum_{R_j \\in D_E} R_j$$\n    The seasonality index is then:\n    $$SI = \\overline{R}_{\\text{growing}} - \\overline{R}_{\\text{dormant}}$$\n    This final value is rounded to three decimal places.\n\nThis comprehensive procedure is applied to each of the three parameter sets provided, and the results are compiled into the specified output format.",
