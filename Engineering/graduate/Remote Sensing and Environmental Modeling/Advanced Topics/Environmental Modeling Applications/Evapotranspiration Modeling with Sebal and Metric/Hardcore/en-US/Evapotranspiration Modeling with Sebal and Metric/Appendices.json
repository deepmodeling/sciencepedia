Round your final evapotranspiration rate to four significant figures and express it in $\\mathrm{mm\\,h^{-1}}$.",
            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on the fundamental principle of surface energy conservation, a cornerstone of micrometeorology and remote sensing applications like SEBAL and METRIC. All required constants and data are provided, the values are physically realistic, and there are no ambiguities or contradictions. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe derivation begins with the principle of conservation of energy at the land surface. The surface energy balance equation states that the net radiation ($R_n$), which is the primary energy source at the surface, is partitioned into several components. For a typical land surface, this balance is expressed as:\n$$\nR_n = G + H + LE\n$$\nwhere:\n- $R_n$ is the net radiation flux, representing the balance between incoming and outgoing shortwave and longwave radiation. Its units are energy per unit time per unit area, expressed as Watts per square meter ($\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$).\n- $G$ is the soil heat flux, representing the energy transferred into or out of the soil via conduction. Its units are also $\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$.\n- $H$ is the sensible heat flux, representing the energy transferred to or from the atmosphere by convection and conduction, causing a change in air temperature. Its units are also $\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$.\n- $LE$ is the latent heat flux, representing the energy consumed during the phase change of water from liquid to vapor (evapotranspiration). Its units are also $\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$.\n\nIn this formulation, energy storage within the canopy and energy used for photosynthesis are considered negligible, which is a standard assumption in the SEBAL and METRIC models.\n\nOur first objective is to derive an expression for the latent heat flux, $LE$. By algebraically rearranging the surface energy balance equation, we can isolate $LE$:\n$$\nLE = R_n - G - H\n$$\nThis equation establishes that the latent heat flux is the residual energy available at the surface after accounting for heat conduction into the ground and convective heating of the air.\n\nThe second objective is to derive an expression for the instantaneous actual evapotranspiration rate, which we denote as $ET_{inst}$, as an equivalent depth of water. The latent heat flux, $LE$, is by definition the energy flux associated with the mass flux of evapotranspired water, $\\dot{m}_{ET}$. This relationship is mediated by the latent heat of vaporization, $\\lambda$, which is the energy required to vaporize a unit mass of water (in Joules per kilogram, $\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}}$). The thermodynamic definition is:\n$$\nLE = \\lambda \\cdot \\dot{m}_{ET}\n$$\nHere, $\\dot{m}_{ET}$ has units of mass per unit time per unit area, such as $\\mathrm{kg\\,s^{-1}\\,m^{-2}}$. We can solve for this mass flux rate:\n$$\n\\dot{m}_{ET} = \\frac{LE}{\\lambda}\n$$\nThe problem requires the evapotranspiration rate to be expressed as an equivalent water depth per unit time (e.g., in $\\mathrm{mm\\,h^{-1}}$). The mass of a volume of water is given by $m = \\rho_w V$, where $\\rho_w$ is the density of water and $V$ is the volume. Over a unit area $A = 1\\ \\mathrm{m^2}$, a water depth $d$ corresponds to a volume $V = A \\cdot d = d \\cdot (1\\ \\mathrm{m^2})$. The corresponding mass per unit area is $m/A = \\rho_w d$. The problem provides the hydrostatic identity that a depth of $1\\ \\mathrm{mm}$ of water over $1\\ \\mathrm{m^2}$ corresponds to a mass of $1\\ \\mathrm{kg}$. This simplifies the conversion, as it implicitly uses a water density $\\rho_w = 1000\\ \\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$.\nLet $ET_{inst}$ be the evapotranspiration rate in terms of water depth per unit time. The mass flux $\\dot{m}_{ET}$ is then equivalent to the volumetric flux rate multiplied by the density of water, which translates directly to the rate of change of water depth. Based on the provided identity, a mass flux of $1\\ \\mathrm{kg\\,s^{-1}\\,m^{-2}}$ corresponds to an equivalent water depth rate of $1\\ \\mathrm{mm\\,s^{-1}}$. Therefore, we can write:\n$$\nET_{inst} [\\mathrm{mm\\,s^{-1}}] = \\dot{m}_{ET} [\\mathrm{kg\\,s^{-1}\\,m^{-2}}]\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\dot{m}_{ET}$ and subsequently for $LE$, we obtain the expression for the instantaneous evapotranspiration rate:\n$$\nET_{inst} = \\frac{LE}{\\lambda} = \\frac{R_n - G - H}{\\lambda}\n$$\nThe units of this expression must be carefully tracked. Given $R_n$, $G$, and $H$ in $\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$ (or $\\mathrm{J\\,s^{-1}\\,m^{-2}}$) and $\\lambda$ in $\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}}$, the resulting unit for $ET_{inst}$ is $\\mathrm{kg\\,s^{-1}\\,m^{-2}}$, which is numerically equivalent to $\\mathrm{mm\\,s^{-1}}$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value for the given pixel. The provided values are:\n$R_n = 600\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$\n$G = 60\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$\n$H = 200\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$\n$\\lambda = 2.45 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the latent heat flux, $LE$:\n$$\nLE = 600\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}} - 60\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}} - 200\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}} = 340\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the instantaneous evapotranspiration rate. The unit $\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$ is equivalent to $\\mathrm{J\\,s^{-1}\\,m^{-2}}$.\n$$\nET_{inst} = \\frac{340\\ \\mathrm{J\\,s^{-1}\\,m^{-2}}}{2.45 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}}} \\approx 1.387755 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{kg\\,s^{-1}\\,m^{-2}}\n$$\nBased on the hydrostatic identity, this is numerically equivalent to $1.387755 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{mm\\,s^{-1}}$. The problem requires the final answer in units of millimeters per hour ($\\mathrm{mm\\,h^{-1}}$). There are $3600$ seconds in one hour ($1\\ \\mathrm{h} = 3600\\ \\mathrm{s}$). Therefore, we must multiply our result by this conversion factor:\n$$\nET_{inst} [\\mathrm{mm\\,h^{-1}}] = ET_{inst} [\\mathrm{mm\\,s^{-1}}] \\times 3600\\ \\mathrm{s\\,h^{-1}}\n$$\n$$\nET_{inst} = \\left(\\frac{340}{2.45 \\times 10^{6}}\\right) \\times 3600\\ \\mathrm{mm\\,h^{-1}}\n$$\n$$\nET_{inst} \\approx (1.387755 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times 3600\\ \\mathrm{mm\\,h^{-1}} \\approx 0.4995918\\ \\mathrm{mm\\,h^{-1}}\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested, we obtain:\n$$\nET_{inst} \\approx 0.4996\\ \\mathrm{mm\\,h^{-1}}\n$$",

The ground heat flux, $G$, represents the energy conducted from the surface into the soil. This process is primarily driven by the amount of net radiation reaching the soil surface.\n\nThe vegetation canopy plays a critical role by intercepting a significant portion of the incoming shortwave radiation and outgoing longwave radiation, thereby reducing the net radiation available at the soil surface beneath the canopy. Consequently, as the density and greenness of the vegetation canopy increase (higher NDVI), the fraction of the total pixel's net radiation that is partitioned into ground heat flux, $f_G = G/R_n$, should decrease.\n\n- **Case (i) Assumption ($f_{G}=c_{1}=0.05$):** This model assumes a constant partitioning fraction, completely neglecting the state of the vegetation. The value $c_{1}=0.05$ is a low fraction typically associated with a very dense, fully closed canopy that effectively shades the ground almost completely. By using this fixed value, the analyst is implicitly assuming that the pixel behaves as if it were under full vegetation cover, irrespective of the actual $\\mathrm{NDVI}$ value. This is a significant oversimplification.\n\n- **Case (ii) Assumption ($f_{G}=c_{1}+c_{2}\\exp(-k\\,\\mathrm{NDVI})$):** This model provides a more physically realistic representation. The fraction $f_G$ is a decaying function of NDVI. For bare soil ($\\mathrm{NDVI} \\approx 0$), the exponential term is close to $1$, and $f_G$ is at its maximum value of $c_1+c_2 = 0.05+0.18=0.23$, meaning $23\\%$ of $R_n$ goes into the soil. As the canopy develops and NDVI increases, the exponential term decreases, causing $f_G$ to diminish. The parameter $c_1=0.05$ represents the asymptotic limit for an infinitely dense canopy ($\\mathrm{NDVI} \\to \\infty$). With a measured $\\mathrm{NDVI}=0.7$, which represents a dense but not perfectly closed canopy, this model calculates a fraction $f_{G, \\text{(ii)}} \\approx 0.177$. This value correctly reflects that while the canopy is dense, it is not a perfect insulator, and a non-trivial amount of energy still reaches and heats the soil.\n\nThe large discrepancy, $\\Delta G \\approx 76.11\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$, highlights the importance of accurately parameterizing $G$. Model (i) significantly underestimates the ground heat flux for this pixel by assuming an idealized, full-canopy condition. Model (ii) provides a more nuanced and accurate estimate by accounting for the actual vegetation density. This difference is critical for the overall energy balance: since $H+\\lambda E = R_{n} - G$, the underestimation of $G$ in Case (i) would lead to an overestimation of the energy available for the turbulent fluxes ($H$ and $\\lambda E$) by $76.11\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$, which would in turn propagate into a substantial error in the final evapotranspiration estimate.",
