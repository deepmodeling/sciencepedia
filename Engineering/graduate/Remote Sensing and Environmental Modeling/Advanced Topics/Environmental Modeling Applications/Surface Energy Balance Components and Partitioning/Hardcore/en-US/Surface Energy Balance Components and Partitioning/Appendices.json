In practice, however, when we measure each component—net radiation ($R_n$), sensible heat flux ($H$), latent heat flux ($LE$), and ground heat flux ($G$)—they often fail to sum to zero, a persistent issue known as the energy balance closure problem. This exercise  challenges you to step into the role of a data analyst at a flux tower site, calculating the energy residual from a real-world data scenario and critically evaluating whether this 'missing' energy represents a physical storage term or the unavoidable accumulation of measurement errors.",

            "problem": "A micrometeorological tower in a dense, well-watered maize canopy (mean height $1.5$ m) reports midday fluxes for a clear summer afternoon over a $15$-minute averaging period centered at local solar time $14{:}00$. The net radiation $R_n$ has been retrieved from hyperspectral and thermal infrared remote sensing using co-located downwelling and upwelling radiometers, and the turbulent fluxes have been measured by eddy covariance (EC) instrumentation. The soil heat flux $G$ is measured with heat flux plates at $0.05$ m depth and corrected to the surface with soil thermal storage. The best-estimate values are: $R_n = 650$ W m$^{-2}$, $H = 220$ W m$^{-2}$, $LE = 360$ W m$^{-2}$, and $G = 40$ W m$^{-2}$. The reported one-standard-deviation uncertainties are: $R_n$ $\\pm 5\\%$, $H$ $\\pm 12$ W m$^{-2}$, $LE$ $\\pm 20$ W m$^{-2}$, and $G$ $\\pm 5$ W m$^{-2}$.\n\nUsing conservation of energy for a land-surface control volume comprising the canopy air space, vegetation biomass, and the upper soil layer, determine the residual term $S$ that closes the surface energy balance over the averaging period employing the reported best-estimate fluxes. Then, reason from first principles whether the sign and magnitude of $S$ are more consistent with transient canopy heat storage or with cumulative measurement error during this afternoon period, explicitly considering the physical pathways through which energy can be stored or missed by the measurement system. Do not assume any shortcut formulas other than those implied by conservation laws and core definitions; clearly articulate the control-volume accounting you use.\n\nRound your computed residual to three significant figures. Express the final residual in W m$^{-2}$.",
            "solution": "The fundamental basis is conservation of energy applied to a land-surface control volume that includes the vegetation canopy (air plus biomass) and the upper soil layer. Over an averaging period sufficiently long compared to turbulent eddy timescales but short compared to diurnal variations, the vertically integrated energy budget for the control volume can be written as\n$$\n\\frac{dU}{dt} = R_n - H - LE - G - \\Phi_{\\text{other}},\n$$\nwhere $U$ is the internal energy stored in the control volume, $R_n$ is the net radiation (net shortwave plus net longwave) at the surface, $H$ is the turbulent sensible heat flux to the atmosphere, $LE$ is the turbulent latent heat flux (latent heat of vaporization times evapotranspiration), $G$ is the conductive heat flux into the ground from the surface, and $\\Phi_{\\text{other}}$ groups additional energy pathways such as biochemical energy storage in photosynthesis, advective energy flux divergence, and terms accounting for phase change or redistribution not captured in $LE$ or $G$. Over short afternoon periods in dense canopies with horizontally homogeneous conditions and negligible advection, $\\Phi_{\\text{other}}$ is commonly small relative to the dominant terms.\n\nBy definition, the residual term $S$ that closes the balance using the measured fluxes is the difference between the net input and the sum of the measured sinks:\n$$\nS \\equiv R_n - \\left(H + LE + G\\right).\n$$\nThis $S$ represents the aggregate of unmeasured storage and any systematic or random measurement errors. A positive $S$ indicates net energy remaining within the control volume (storage), while a negative $S$ indicates apparent depletion.\n\nUsing the provided best-estimate values, substitute:\n$$\nR_n = 650 \\ \\text{W m}^{-2}, \\quad H = 220 \\ \\text{W m}^{-2}, \\quad LE = 360 \\ \\text{W m}^{-2}, \\quad G = 40 \\ \\text{W m}^{-2}.\n$$\nCompute the sum of turbulent and ground fluxes:\n$$\nH + LE + G = 220 + 360 + 40 = 620 \\ \\text{W m}^{-2}.\n$$\nThen the residual is\n$$\nS = 650 - 620 = 30 \\ \\text{W m}^{-2}.\n$$\nRounded to three significant figures, $S = 30.0$ W m$^{-2}$; in standard scientific notation, this is $3.00 \\times 10^{1}$ W m$^{-2}$.\n\nTo interpret whether this $S$ is more consistent with canopy heat storage or measurement error, consider first principles for storage pathways:\n\n- Canopy air and biomass heat storage arises from warming of the canopy air space and vegetation tissues during the early-to-mid afternoon. The storage rate can be approximated as\n$$\nS_{\\text{canopy}} \\approx \\int_{0}^{h} \\left( \\rho c_p \\frac{\\partial T_a}{\\partial t} + C_v \\frac{\\partial T_v}{\\partial t} \\right) \\, dz,\n$$\nwhere $h$ is canopy height, $\\rho$ is air density, $c_p$ is specific heat of air, $T_a$ is canopy air temperature, $C_v$ is volumetric heat capacity of vegetation elements, and $T_v$ is vegetation temperature. For a dense $1.5$ m canopy under strong insolation, midday warming rates on the order of a few tenths of K per $10$ minutes can generate storage on the order of tens of W m$^{-2}$.\n\n- Soil near-surface thermal storage between the heat-flux plates and the surface is already corrected into $G$ per the problem statement, so its contribution is unlikely to be a large missing term.\n\n- Biochemical energy storage in photosynthesis is typically $\\ll 10$ W m$^{-2}$ even at high productivity and thus generally negligible relative to tens of W m$^{-2}$.\n\n- Measurement uncertainties: $R_n$ $\\pm 5\\%$ implies $\\pm 0.05 \\times 650 = \\pm 32.5$ W m$^{-2}$; $H$ $\\pm 12$ W m$^{-2}$; $LE$ $\\pm 20$ W m$^{-2}$; $G$ $\\pm 5$ W m$^{-2}$. The combined uncertainty in $S$ from independent errors can be estimated by root-sum-square (RSS):\n$$\n\\sigma_S \\approx \\sqrt{(32.5)^{2} + (12)^{2} + (20)^{2} + (5)^{2}} \\approx \\sqrt{1056.25 + 144 + 400 + 25} \\approx \\sqrt{1625.25} \\approx 40.3 \\ \\text{W m}^{-2}.\n$$\nThis suggests that the instantaneous residual of $30$ W m$^{-2}$ lies within the expected combined measurement uncertainty.\n\nWe can now assess plausibility: a positive $S$ of approximately $30$ W m$^{-2}$ during a sunlit afternoon is physically consistent with transient warming of the canopy air and biomass, which commonly contributes on the order of $10$–$50$ W m$^{-2}$ depending on canopy structure and diurnal phase. Simultaneously, the magnitude is also comparable to the combined measurement uncertainty, indicating that a portion of $S$ could be attributable to errors in $R_n$, $H$, $LE$, and $G$. The sign (positive) aligns with expected midday storage rather than depletion. Therefore, from first principles, the sign and magnitude are consistent with a physically plausible canopy storage signal, but they are not distinguishable from measurement uncertainty without additional independent storage measurements.\n\nThe computed residual requested for reporting is $S = 3.00 \\times 10^{1}$ W m$^{-2}$, rounded to three significant figures.",

            "solution": "This problem involves calculating the surface sensible heat flux using two different methods and then finding the ratio of the results.\n\n### Step 1: Calculation of Sensible Heat Flux using MOST\n\nThe first task is to compute the sensible heat flux, designated here as $H_{\\mathrm{MOST}}$, using the flux-gradient relationship derived from Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory. The sensible heat flux $H$ is defined as $H = \\rho c_p \\overline{w'T'}$, where $\\overline{w'T'}$ is the kinematic heat flux. In MOST, the kinematic heat flux is parameterized as $\\overline{w'T'} = -u_* T_*$, where $T_*$ is the characteristic temperature scale. Thus, the sensible heat flux is given by:\n$$H_{\\mathrm{MOST}} = -\\rho c_p u_* T_*$$\nThe temperature scale $T_*$ is related to the temperature profile in the surface layer. The integrated form of the temperature profile under MOST is:\n$$T_a(z) - T_s = \\frac{T_*}{\\kappa} \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{z-d}{z_{0h}}\\right) - \\psi_h\\left(\\frac{z-d}{L}\\right) \\right]$$\nHere, $T_a(z)$ is the air temperature at height $z$, $T_s$ is the surface aerodynamic temperature, $\\kappa$ is the von Kármán constant, $d$ is the displacement height, $z_{0h}$ is the roughness length for heat, and $\\psi_h$ is the integrated stability correction function for heat.\n\nWe can solve for $T_*$:\n$$T_* = \\frac{\\kappa (T_a(z) - T_s)}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{z-d}{z_{0h}}\\right) - \\psi_h}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $T_*$ into the equation for $H_{\\mathrm{MOST}}$:\n$$H_{\\mathrm{MOST}} = -\\rho c_p u_* \\left( \\frac{\\kappa (T_a(z) - T_s)}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{z-d}{z_{0h}}\\right) - \\psi_h} \\right) = \\frac{\\rho c_p u_* \\kappa (T_s - T_a(z))}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{z-d}{z_{0h}}\\right) - \\psi_h}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression.\nGiven:\n$\\rho = 1.18\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n$c_p = 1005\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n$u_* = 0.45\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$\\kappa = 0.4$\n$T_s = 312\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n$T_a(z) = 304\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n$z = 10\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$d = 0\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$z_{0h} = 0.015\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$\\psi_h = -1.8$\n\nThe temperature difference is $T_s - T_a(z) = 312\\,\\mathrm{K} - 304\\,\\mathrm{K} = 8\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\nThe argument of the logarithm is $\\frac{z-d}{z_{0h}} = \\frac{10 - 0}{0.015} = \\frac{10000}{15} \\approx 666.67$.\n$\\ln(666.67) \\approx 6.502$.\n\nNow, we calculate $H_{\\mathrm{MOST}}$:\n$$H_{\\mathrm{MOST}} = \\frac{(1.18) \\times (1005) \\times (0.45) \\times (0.4) \\times (8)}{6.502 - (-1.8)}$$\n$$H_{\\mathrm{MOST}} = \\frac{1707.84}{8.302} \\approx 205.71\\,\\mathrm{W}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$$\n\n### Step 2: Calculation of Sensible Heat Flux using the Bulk Aerodynamic Method\n\nThe second task is to compute the sensible heat flux, designated as $H_{\\mathrm{bulk}}$, using the bulk aerodynamic formula. This formula relates the flux to the mean wind speed and temperature difference between the surface and the air at a reference height, using a bulk transfer coefficient.\n$$H_{\\mathrm{bulk}} = \\rho c_p C_H U(z) (T_s - T_a(z))$$\nThe problem specifies using a constant scalar transfer coefficient $C_{H}^{(0)} = 1.3 \\times 10^{-3}$.

The MOST approach incorporates stability effects in a physically detailed manner, whereas the bulk method with a constant (likely neutral) transfer coefficient does not, leading to a significant underestimation of the flux in this unstable case.",
