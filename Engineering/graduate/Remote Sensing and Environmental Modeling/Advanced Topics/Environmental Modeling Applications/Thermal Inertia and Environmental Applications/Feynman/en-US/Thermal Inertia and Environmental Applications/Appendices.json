Starting from the fundamental heat conduction equation, you will derive how a material's intrinsic properties—its thermal conductivity ($k$), density ($\\rho$), and specific heat capacity ($c$)—combine into a single parameter that governs its resistance to temperature change under diurnal heating. This practice  is essential for grasping why thermal inertia, $I = \\sqrt{k\\rho c}$, is the key property we seek to measure with thermal remote sensing.",

            "problem": "A homogeneous, dry loamy soil is observed by a Thermal Infrared (TIR) remote sensing instrument over a clear-sky day. Assume the upper boundary at the land surface is subject to a diurnally varying net heat-flux forcing that can be approximated as a single-frequency sinusoid and that the subsurface can be treated as a semi-infinite medium. The soil is characterized by thermal conductivity $k$, bulk density $\\rho$, and specific heat capacity $c$. Using first-principles heat transport, derive an appropriate expression for the material property commonly used to quantify resistance to surface temperature change over the diurnal cycle, then compute its value for the given soil.\n\nGiven $k=1.5\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$, $\\rho=1600\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$, and $c=800\\,\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$:\n- Derive the quantity that aggregates $k$, $\\rho$, and $c$ to characterize the soil’s tendency to resist diurnal temperature swings, and then compute its numerical value.

Base your reasoning on physically transparent steps (energy storage and diffusion), not on memorized end formulas.\n\nYour final numerical answer should be the computed value of the aggregated property indicated above. Round to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of a material property that quantifies a soil's resistance to diurnal temperature change, based on first principles of heat transfer. It also requires a physical explanation of how thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity individually affect this temperature response.\n\nThe physical system is modeled as a one-dimensional, semi-infinite, homogeneous medium (the soil), with heat transport governed by the heat conduction equation. Assuming no internal heat generation, the equation is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial T(z, t)}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 T(z, t)}{\\partial z^2} $$\nwhere $T$ is the temperature at depth $z$ (positive downwards from the surface at $z=0$) and time $t$. The parameter $\\alpha$ is the thermal diffusivity, defined as:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{k}{\\rho c} $$\nwith $k$ being the thermal conductivity, $\\rho$ the bulk density, and $c$ the specific heat capacity.\n\nThe upper boundary at the surface ($z=0$) is subjected to a sinusoidal net heat flux, representing the diurnal cycle of solar heating and nighttime cooling. We can represent this forcing using complex notation for mathematical convenience, where the physical flux is the real part:\n$$ q(0, t) = q_0 \\cos(\\omega t) = \\text{Re}\\{q_0 \\exp(i\\omega t)\\} $$\nHere, $q_0$ is the amplitude of the net heat flux and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of the diurnal cycle, where $\\omega=2\\pi/P$ and $P$ is the period (e.g., $24$ hours).\n\nWe seek a periodic solution for the temperature perturbation, $T'(z,t)$, that is driven by this flux. By solving the heat equation with the flux boundary condition, one finds that the amplitude of the surface temperature swing, $T_{amp}$, is related to the amplitude of the heat flux, $q_0$, by:\n$$ T_{amp} = \\frac{q_0}{\\sqrt{k \\rho c \\omega}} $$\nThis equation shows that for a given heat flux forcing (fixed $q_0$ and $\\omega$), the resulting surface temperature amplitude is inversely proportional to the term $\\sqrt{k \\rho c}$. Therefore, the material's resistance to temperature change is directly proportional to this term. The aggregated property that quantifies this resistance is the **thermal inertia**, $I$:\n$$ I = \\sqrt{k \\rho c} $$\nA higher thermal inertia signifies greater resistance to temperature change.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of the thermal inertia for the given soil properties:\n$k=1.5\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n$\\rho=1600\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$\n$c=800\\,\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n\nThe product $k \\rho c$ is:\n$$ k \\rho c = (1.5) \\times (1600) \\times (800) = 1,920,000 $$\nThe units are $(\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}) \\times (\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) = (\\mathrm{J\\,s^{-1}\\,m^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}) \\times (\\mathrm{J\\,kg^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) = \\mathrm{J^2\\,s^{-1}\\,m^{-4}\\,K^{-2}}$.\nThe thermal inertia $I$ is the square root:\n$$ I = \\sqrt{1,920,000} \\approx 1385.6406... \\,\\, \\mathrm{J\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-1}\\,s^{-1/2}} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$ I = 1386 \\,\\, \\mathrm{J\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-1}\\,s^{-1/2}} $$\n\nFinally, we analyze the effect of changing $k$ and $c$ on the surface temperature amplitude, $T_{amp}$, from physical principles. The surface temperature at any moment is the result of a dynamic balance between the energy flux at the surface and the subsurface's ability to store this energy (governed by volumetric heat capacity $\\rho c$) and transport it away from the surface (governed by thermal conductivity $k$).\n\nCase 1: Doubling thermal conductivity ($k \\to 2k$)\nWhen $k$ is doubled, the soil's ability to conduct heat is enhanced. During the day, as the surface absorbs net radiation, this energy is more rapidly and efficiently transported (diffused) into the cooler subsurface. This rapid removal of energy from the immediate surface layer means that less energy accumulates at the very top, resulting in a smaller temperature increase. At night, as the surface cools by radiating heat away, a higher $k$ allows heat from the warmer subsurface to be conducted back to the surface more effectively, which slows the rate of cooling. Both effects lead to a moderation of the temperature extremes. Consequently, the diurnal surface temperature amplitude **decreases**.\n\nCase 2: Doubling specific heat capacity ($c \\to 2c$)\nWhen $c$ is doubled, the volumetric heat capacity $\\rho c$ also doubles. This means that twice the amount of thermal energy is required to raise the temperature of a unit volume of soil by one degree. During the day, as the surface absorbs a given amount of net heat flux, this increased capacity for energy storage means the temperature of the surface layer rises more slowly and to a lesser extent. The material acts as a larger thermal reservoir. At night, the soil has stored more heat and must lose more of it to cool down by a given amount, thus slowing the cooling process. This buffering effect also moderates temperature extremes. Consequently, the diurnal surface temperature amplitude **decreases**.\n\nTo determine the multiplicative factor of change, we use the derived relationship $T_{amp} \\propto 1/\\sqrt{k \\rho c}$. Let the initial amplitude be $T_{amp, i}$.\nIf $k \\to 2k$, the new amplitude $T_{amp, k}$ is:\n$$ T_{amp, k} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(2k)\\rho c}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k\\rho c}} \\implies T_{amp, k} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} T_{amp, i} $$\nIf $c \\to 2c$, the new amplitude $T_{amp, c}$ is:\n$$ T_{amp, c} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k\\rho(2c)}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k\\rho c}} \\implies T_{amp, c} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} T_{amp, i} $$\nIn both cases, the amplitude decreases by a multiplicative factor of $1/\\sqrt{2}$.",

Assume the single-layer energy closure appropriate for midday conditions: neglect within-canopy and air-column storage terms, horizontal advection, and photosynthetic heat storage, so that the dominant pathways are radiative exchange, turbulent exchange, and conductive exchange into the substrate.
