The ratio $\\lambda_D / L \\ll 1$ indicates that the thickness of this space-charge layer is thousands of times smaller than the characteristic dimension of the pore. Consequently, the EDL occupies a negligible fraction of the pore volume. The vast majority of the electrolyte within the pore is outside the EDL and can be considered electrically neutral, just like the bulk electrolyte. This justifies neglecting bulk space-charge effects and using the simplifying assumption of electroneutrality when modeling macroscopic ion transport within such porous electrodes, as any deviation from neutrality is confined to extremely thin regions near the solid-liquid interfaces.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the composition-dependent chemical diffusivity, $D_{\\mathrm{chem}}(x)$, for a single-phase intercalation electrode. The derivation must start from the provided fundamental relations of nonequilibrium thermodynamics and the specific regular solution model for activity.\n\nThe starting point is the equation for mass conservation (continuity equation) and the expression for the diffusive flux, $\\mathbf{J}$.\nThe conservation of species is given by:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} $$\nThe diffusive flux, $\\mathbf{J}$, is driven by the gradient of the chemical potential, $\\mu$:\n$$ \\mathbf{J} = - M\\,c\\,\\nabla \\mu $$\nwhere $M$ is the mobility and $c$ is the molar concentration.\n\nSubstituting the expression for the flux into the conservation equation yields:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla \\cdot (-M\\,c\\,\\nabla \\mu) = \\nabla \\cdot (M\\,c\\,\\nabla \\mu) $$\nThe chemical potential $\\mu$ is a function of concentration $c$.

The term $D^* \\left( \\frac{\\Omega}{R\\,T} x(1-2x) \\right)$ represents the deviation from ideal behavior ($D_{chem} = D^*$). The sign of the interaction parameter $\\Omega$ determines the nature of this deviation.\nIf $\\Omega > 0$, interactions are repulsive. For low concentrations ($x < 1/2$), the term $x(1-2x)$ is positive, leading to $D_{\\mathrm{chem}} > D^*$. This indicates that repulsive forces enhance diffusion by \"pushing\" particles away from each other. For high concentrations ($x > 1/2$), the term $x(1-2x)$ is negative, leading to $D_{\\mathrm{chem}} < D^*$, where diffusion is slowed. If $\\Omega$ is sufficiently large, $D_{\\mathrm{chem}}$ can become negative, signaling an instability that leads to phase separation (spinodal decomposition).\nIf $\\Omega < 0$, interactions are attractive. The behavior is reversed. For $x < 1/2$, diffusion is hindered ($D_{\\mathrm{chem}} < D^*$) as particles prefer to cluster. For $x > 1/2$, diffusion is enhanced ($D_{\\mathrm{chem}} > D^*$). Again, a sufficiently negative $\\Omega$ can result in a negative diffusivity and phase separation, this time driven by attractive clustering.\nIf $\\Omega = 0$, we recover the ideal case where $D_{\\mathrm{chem}} = D^*$, meaning the chemical diffusivity is constant and equal to the tracer diffusivity, independent of composition.",

The condition $G \\ge -1$ implies $1 - 4\\alpha\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}\\right) \\ge -1$, which gives $2 \\ge 4\\alpha\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}\\right)$, or $\\alpha \\le \\frac{1}{2\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}\\right)}$.\nThis must hold for all $k$. The most restrictive condition occurs when the denominator is minimized, which corresponds to the maximum value of $\\sin^2\\left(\\frac{k \\Delta x}{2}\\right)$. The maximum value is $1$.\nThus, the stability requirement is:\n$$\n\\alpha \\le \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nSubstituting back the definition of $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\frac{D \\Delta t}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\le \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThis gives the stability restriction on the time step:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\le \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{2D}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the Maximum Stable Time Step**\n\nThe maximum stable time step, $\\Delta t_{\\max}$, is found by taking the equality in the stability criterion. To ensure stability across all operating conditions where the diffusion coefficient $D$ may vary, we must use the maximum possible value of the diffusion coefficient, $D_{\\max}$. This provides the most restrictive (smallest) stable time step.\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{2D_{\\max}}\n$$\nWe are given the following values:\n- $\\Delta x = 0.5 \\,\\mu\\text{m} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\text{m}$\n- $D_{\\max} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-10} \\,\\text{m}^2 \\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n\nWe compute the values for the numerator and denominator:\n- $(\\Delta x)^2 = (0.5 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\text{m})^2 = 0.25 \\times 10^{-12} \\,\\text{m}^2$\n- $2D_{\\max} = 2 \\times (2.0 \\times 10^{-10} \\,\\text{m}^2 \\,\\text{s}^{-1}) = 4.0 \\times 10^{-10} \\,\\text{m}^2 \\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n\nNow, we calculate $\\Delta t_{\\max}$:\n$$\n\\Delta t_{\\max} = \\frac{0.25 \\times 10^{-12} \\,\\text{m}^2}{4.0 \\times 10^{-10} \\,\\text{m}^2 \\,\\text{s}^{-1}} = 0.0625 \\times 10^{-2} \\,\\text{s} = 6.25 \\times 10^{-4} \\,\\text{s}\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding to three significant figures. The result $6.25 \\times 10^{-4}$ is already in three significant figures.\n\n**Part 3: Inadequacy of the Diffusion-Only Bound**\n\nRelying solely on the diffusion-based time-step bound is inadequate because it completely neglects the contribution of the migration term, which fundamentally alters the mathematical character of the partial differential equation and its stability properties.\n\nThe full conservation equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} \\right) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( \\frac{D z F}{R T} c \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x} \\right)\n$$\nThe second term on the right-hand side is the migration term. Let us define an effective migration velocity $v = \\frac{D z F}{R T} \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial x}$. The equation contains a term of the form $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}(vc)$. This is an advection (or convection) term. The full equation is an advection-diffusion equation.\n\nDiscretizing the first-order spatial derivative of the advection term using a second-order central difference (consistent with the problem statement's approach) yields a scheme known as Forward-Time Central-Space (FTCS). Applying FTCS to the pure advection equation $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + v \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} = 0$ (assuming constant $v$ for analysis) results in an update rule whose amplification factor magnitude is $|G|^2 = 1 + \\left(\\frac{v \\Delta t}{\\Delta x}\\sin(k \\Delta x)\\right)^2$. Since $|G| > 1$ for any non-trivial choice of parameters, the FTCS scheme for advection is unconditionally unstable. Consequently, when the migration term is significant, the overall explicit scheme will be unstable regardless of how small a time step is chosen to satisfy the diffusion criterion.\n\nTo achieve stability, the advection term must be handled differently, for example by using an upwind differencing scheme. The stability of such a scheme for the advection part is governed by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition. The mathematical structure of this additional stability restriction is of the form:\n$$\n\\Delta t \\le C_{\\text{max}} \\frac{\\Delta x}{|v|}\n$$\nwhere $|v|$ is the magnitude of the migration velocity, and $C_{\\text{max}}$ is a constant of order $1$ (e.g., $C_{\\text{max}}=1$ for a first-order upwind scheme). This CFL condition introduces a new constraint on $\\Delta t$ that is proportional to $\\Delta x$, contrasting with the diffusion constraint where $\\Delta t$ is proportional to $(\\Delta x)^2$. The final stable time step for the full advection-diffusion equation must satisfy *both* the diffusive and the advective constraints, meaning $\\Delta t$ must be less than the minimum of the time steps dictated by each phenomenon. Ignoring the advection constraint can lead to catastrophic numerical instability.",
