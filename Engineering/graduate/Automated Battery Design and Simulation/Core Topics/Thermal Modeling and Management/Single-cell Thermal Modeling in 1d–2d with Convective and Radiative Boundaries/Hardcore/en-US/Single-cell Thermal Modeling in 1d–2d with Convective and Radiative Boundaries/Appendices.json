Thus, this information is contextual rather than contradictory.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe derivation of the local volumetric ohmic heat generation term, $q'''_{\\text{ohm}}$, starts from the first principles of electromagnetism. The rate of energy dissipation per unit volume due to an electric current flowing through a resistive medium is given by the dot product of the electric current density vector, $\\mathbf{J}$, and the electric field vector, $\\mathbf{E}$. This is the differential form of Joule's first law.\n\n$$\nq'''_{\\text{ohm}} = \\mathbf{J} \\cdot \\mathbf{E}\n$$\n\nThe problem states that the electrolyte is treated as a homogeneous, isotropic conductor. For such a medium, the relationship between current density, electric field, and conductivity is given by Ohm's law in its vector form:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{J} = \\sigma_e \\mathbf{E}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sigma_e$ is the electrical conductivity of the electrolyte.\n\nThe electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ is defined as the negative gradient of the electric potential, $\\phi$:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla \\phi\n$$\n\nWe can express $q'''_{\\text{ohm}}$ in terms of the potential gradient $\\nabla \\phi$ by substituting the expressions for $\\mathbf{J}$ and $\\mathbf{E}$. First, substitute the expression for $\\mathbf{E}$ into Ohm's law:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{J} = \\sigma_e (-\\nabla\\phi) = -\\sigma_e \\nabla\\phi\n$$\n\nNow, substitute the expressions for both $\\mathbf{J}$ and $\\mathbf{E}$ into the equation for Joule heating:\n\n$$\nq'''_{\\text{ohm}} = (-\\sigma_e \\nabla\\phi) \\cdot (-\\nabla \\phi)\n$$\n\nThe dot product of a vector with itself is the square of its magnitude. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:\n\n$$\nq'''_{\\text{ohm}} = \\sigma_e (\\nabla\\phi \\cdot \\nabla\\phi) = \\sigma_e |\\nabla\\phi|^2\n$$\n\nThis equation correctly identifies the local volumetric ohmic heat generation term based on the electrolyte conductivity and the local potential gradient.\n\nWe are asked to evaluate this term for a specific operating point where the electrolyte conductivity is $\\sigma_e = 2\\ \\mathrm{S\\,m^{-1}}$ and the magnitude of the electrolyte potential gradient is $|\\nabla \\phi| = 20\\ \\mathrm{V\\,m^{-1}}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n\n$$\nq'''_{\\text{ohm}} = (2\\ \\mathrm{S\\,m^{-1}}) \\times (20\\ \\mathrm{V\\,m^{-1}})^2\n$$\n$$\nq'''_{\\text{ohm}} = (2\\ \\mathrm{S\\,m^{-1}}) \\times (400\\ \\mathrm{V^2\\,m^{-2}})\n$$\n$$\nq'''_{\\text{ohm}} = 800\\ \\mathrm{S\\,V^2\\,m^{-3}}\n$$\n\nTo verify the units, we recall that a Siemens ($\\mathrm{S}$) is an inverse Ohm ($\\Omega^{-1}$), which is also Amperes per Volt ($\\mathrm{A\\,V^{-1}}$). The unit of power, the Watt ($\\mathrm{W}$), is Volts times Amperes ($\\mathrm{V \\cdot A}$).\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{S \\cdot V^2 \\cdot m^{-3}} = (\\mathrm{A\\,V^{-1}}) \\cdot \\mathrm{V^2} \\cdot \\mathrm{m^{-3}} = \\mathrm{A \\cdot V \\cdot m^{-3}} = \\mathrm{W \\cdot m^{-3}}\n$$\n\nThe resulting unit is Watts per cubic meter, which is correct for volumetric heat generation.\nThe numerical value is $800\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-3}}$. The problem requires rounding to three significant figures. In scientific notation, this is $8.00 \\times 10^2\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-3}}$.\n\nFinally, we comment on the spatial uniformity of $q'''_{\\text{ohm}}$. The expression is $q'''_{\\text{ohm}} = \\sigma_e |\\nabla\\phi|^2$. The problem states that material parameters, including $\\sigma_e$, are spatially uniform. Therefore, the spatial distribution of $q'''_{\\text{ohm}}$ is determined entirely by the spatial distribution of $|\\nabla\\phi|^2$.\n\n1.  **One-dimensional potential distribution ($\\phi = \\phi(x)$):** In a region free of charge sources, the potential satisfies Laplace's equation, $\\nabla^2 \\phi = 0$. In one dimension, this becomes $\\frac{d^2\\phi}{dx^2} = 0$. The general solution is a linear function $\\phi(x) = Ax + B$. The gradient is $\\nabla\\phi = \\frac{d\\phi}{dx}\\mathbf{i} = A\\mathbf{i}$, and its magnitude is $|\\nabla\\phi| = |A|$, which is a constant. Consequently, for a 1D potential field, $q'''_{\\text{ohm}}$ is expected to be **spatially uniform**.\n\n2.  **Two-dimensional potential distribution ($\\phi = \\phi(x, y)$):** The potential satisfies the 2D Laplace equation, $\\frac{\\partial^2\\phi}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2\\phi}{\\partial y^2} = 0$. For a general 2D domain with boundary conditions typical of a prismatic cell (e.g., current collection tabs), the solution $\\phi(x, y)$ will not be a simple linear function. The potential field lines will curve, and their density will vary across the domain, leading to a non-uniform potential gradient magnitude, $|\\nabla\\phi| = \\sqrt{(\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial x})^2 + (\\frac{\\partial\\phi}{\\partial y})^2}$. The gradient is typically largest near current collectors or geometric singularities. As a result, for a 2D potential field, $q'''_{\\text{ohm}}$ is expected to be **spatially non-uniform**.\n\nThe nature of the thermal boundary conditions (convection and radiation) influences the resulting temperature distribution $T(\\mathbf{r})$, but it does not affect the distribution of the heat source $q'''_{\\text{ohm}}$ under the problem's explicit assumption that material properties like $\\sigma_e$ are constant (i.e., the electrical and thermal models are decoupled). If $\\sigma_e$ were a function of temperature, $\\sigma_e(T)$, then the non-uniform temperature field would induce non-uniformity in $\\sigma_e$, which would in turn affect the potential distribution and the heat generation, creating a coupled electro-thermal feedback loop.",

At $x=0$, there is an adiabatic plane of symmetry. This implies that the heat flux across this plane is zero. According to Fourier's law of conduction, the heat flux is $q''_x = -k \\frac{dT}{dx}$. Therefore, the boundary condition is:\n    $$ \\frac{dT}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=0} = 0 $$\n2.  At $x=L$, the surface is cooled by convection to an ambient fluid at temperature $T_{\\infty}$ with a heat transfer coefficient $h$. The heat conducted to the surface from the interior must balance the heat convected away to the ambient. This gives the Robin boundary condition:\n    $$ -k \\frac{dT}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=L} = h[T(L) - T_{\\infty}] $$\n\nWe solve the governing ODE by integrating twice with respect to $x$.\nIntegrating once gives the temperature gradient:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dx} = -\\frac{q'''}{k}x + C_1 $$\nwhere $C_1$ is the first constant of integration.\nApplying the first boundary condition at $x=0$:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dx}\\bigg|_{x=0} = -\\frac{q'''}{k}(0) + C_1 = 0 \\implies C_1 = 0 $$\nSo, the temperature gradient is $\\frac{dT}{dx} = -\\frac{q'''}{k}x$.\n\nIntegrating a second time gives the temperature profile:\n$$ T(x) = -\\frac{q'''}{2k}x^2 + C_2 $$\nwhere $C_2$ is the second constant of integration.\n\nNow, we apply the second boundary condition at $x=L$.

With $f'(T) = 4T^3$, we have:\n$$\nT_0^4 \\approx (T_0^{(m)})^4 + 4(T_0^{(m)})^3(T_0 - T_0^{(m)}) = 4(T_0^{(m)})^3 T_0 - 3(T_0^{(m)})^4\n$$\nSubstituting this linearized expression for $T_0^4$ back into the discretized boundary condition:\n$$\n-k\\left(\\frac{T_1 - T_{-1}}{2\\Delta x}\\right) = h(T_0 - T_{\\infty}) + \\epsilon\\sigma_{\\text{SB}}\\left[\\left(4(T_0^{(m)})^3 T_0 - 3(T_0^{(m)})^4\\right) - T_{\\infty}^4\\right]\n$$\nNow, we must perform algebraic manipulation to solve for $T_{-1}$. Multiply both sides by $-\\frac{2\\Delta x}{k}$:\n$$\nT_1 - T_{-1} = -\\frac{2\\Delta x}{k} \\left[ h(T_0 - T_{\\infty}) + \\epsilon\\sigma_{\\text{SB}}\\left(4(T_0^{(m)})^3 T_0 - 3(T_0^{(m)})^4 - T_{\\infty}^4\\right) \\right]\n$$\nIsolate $T_{-1}$:\n$$\nT_{-1} = T_1 + \\frac{2\\Delta x}{k} \\left[ h(T_0 - T_{\\infty}) + \\epsilon\\sigma_{\\text{SB}}\\left(4(T_0^{(m)})^3 T_0 - 3(T_0^{(m)})^4 - T_{\\infty}^4\\right) \\right]\n$$\nTo obtain the final expression, we expand the terms within the brackets and group them:\n$$\nT_{-1} = T_1 + \\frac{2\\Delta x}{k} \\left[ hT_0 - hT_{\\infty} + 4\\epsilon\\sigma_{\\text{SB}}(T_0^{(m)})^3 T_0 - 3\\epsilon\\sigma_{\\text{SB}}(T_0^{(m)})^4 - \\epsilon\\sigma_{\\text{SB}} T_{\\infty}^4 \\right]\n$$\nFinally, we collect coefficients of $T_0$ and the constant terms:\n$$\nT_{-1} = T_1 + \\frac{2\\Delta x}{k} \\left[ (h + 4\\epsilon\\sigma_{\\text{SB}}(T_0^{(m)})^3)T_0 - hT_{\\infty} - \\epsilon\\sigma_{\\text{SB}}\\left(3(T_0^{(m)})^4 + T_{\\infty}^4\\right) \\right]\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression for the ghost node temperature $T_{-1}$.",
