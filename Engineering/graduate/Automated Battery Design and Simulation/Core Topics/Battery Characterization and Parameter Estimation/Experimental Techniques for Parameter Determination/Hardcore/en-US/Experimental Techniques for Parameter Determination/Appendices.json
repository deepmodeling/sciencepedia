The platform applies a single-frequency small sinusoidal voltage perturbation and measures the resulting current. For reliable parameter determination, two experimental constraints must be simultaneously satisfied:\n\n1. Small-signal linearity: In the neighborhood of equilibrium, the Butler–Volmer relation linearizes when the instantaneous overpotential amplitude remains sufficiently small relative to the thermal voltage. The experiment owner specifies that the peak overpotential amplitude must not exceed a dimensionless fraction $\\beta$ of the thermal voltage $RT/F$, with $\\beta = 0.10$, where $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $F$ is the Faraday constant.\n\n2. Measurement fidelity: The Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of the measured current at the excitation frequency must be at least a specified target. The instrument reports its current noise floor as a root-mean-square (RMS) value $I_{\\mathrm{noise,rms}}$, and SNR is defined as the ratio of the measured current RMS amplitude to $I_{\\mathrm{noise,rms}}$. The required minimum SNR is $\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\min} = 25$.\n\nThe platform uses RMS notation for the applied sinusoidal voltage amplitude, while the linearity constraint is specified in terms of the instantaneous (peak) overpotential amplitude. A preliminary sweep at the target frequency yielded a magnitude of the cell impedance $\\lvert Z \\rvert = 0.200\\ \\Omega$, and the instrument’s current noise floor at that frequency was measured to be $I_{\\mathrm{noise,rms}} = 0.30\\ \\mathrm{mA}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the largest acceptable root-mean-square (RMS) sinusoidal voltage amplitude for an electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiment, subject to two simultaneous constraints: one for small-signal linearity and another for measurement signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Let the RMS voltage amplitude be denoted by $V_{\\mathrm{rms}}$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the small-signal linearity constraint. The Butler-Volmer relation, which describes electrode kinetics, linearizes for small overpotentials, $\\eta$. The problem specifies that the peak overpotential amplitude, $\\eta_{\\mathrm{peak}}$, must not exceed a dimensionless fraction $\\beta$ of the thermal voltage, $V_T = \\frac{RT}{F}$. The value of $\\beta$ is given as $0.10$. This constraint is expressed as:\n$$ \\eta_{\\mathrm{peak}} \\le \\beta \\frac{RT}{F} $$\nIn potentiostatic EIS, the applied sinusoidal voltage perturbation is the overpotential. Therefore, the peak overpotential amplitude $\\eta_{\\mathrm{peak}}$ is identical to the peak amplitude of the applied voltage, $V_{\\mathrm{peak}}$. For a sinusoidal waveform, the peak amplitude $V_{\\mathrm{peak}}$ is related to the RMS amplitude $V_{\\mathrm{rms}}$ by the relation $V_{\\mathrm{peak}} = \\sqrt{2} V_{\\mathrm{rms}}$. Substituting these relationships into the linearity constraint inequality gives:\n$$ \\sqrt{2} V_{\\mathrm{rms}} \\le \\beta \\frac{RT}{F} $$\nThis inequality establishes an upper bound for the permissible RMS voltage amplitude:\n$$ V_{\\mathrm{rms}} \\le \\frac{\\beta}{\\sqrt{2}} \\frac{RT}{F} $$\nThis is the maximum voltage allowed by the linearity requirement, which we denote as $V_{\\mathrm{upper}}$.\n\nSecond, we analyze the measurement fidelity constraint, which requires the SNR of the measured current to be at least a specified minimum, $\\mathrm{SNR}_{\\min} = 25$. The SNR is defined as the ratio of the measured RMS current amplitude, $I_{\\mathrm{rms}}$, to the instrument's RMS current noise floor, $I_{\\mathrm{noise,rms}}$. This constraint is written as:\n$$ \\mathrm{SNR} = \\frac{I_{\\mathrm{rms}}}{I_{\\mathrm{noise,rms}}} \\ge \\mathrm{SNR}_{\\min} $$\nFrom this, we can derive the minimum required RMS current for a valid measurement:\n$$ I_{\\mathrm{rms}} \\ge \\mathrm{SNR}_{\\min} \\cdot I_{\\mathrm{noise,rms}} $$\nThe relationship between the RMS voltage across the cell, $V_{\\mathrm{rms}}$, and the RMS current through it, $I_{\\mathrm{rms}}$, is governed by the magnitude of the cell's impedance, $\\lvert Z \\rvert$, at the given frequency, according to Ohm's law: $V_{\\mathrm{rms}} = \\lvert Z \\rvert I_{\\mathrm{rms}}$. We can express $I_{\\mathrm{rms}}$ in terms of $V_{\\mathrm{rms}}$ as $I_{\\mathrm{rms}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{rms}}}{\\lvert Z \\rvert}$.

            "solution": "The problem statement describes a realistic scenario in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. There are no contradictions or missing information that would prevent a rigorous analysis. Therefore, the problem is valid. We proceed to derive the solution from first principles.\n\n### 1. Fundamental Principles\n\n**a. The Electrode Interface Impedance (Ideal Case)**\nThe total current density $j$ at the electrode interface is the sum of the faradaic current density $j_f$ (due to the charge-transfer reaction) and the capacitive current density $j_c$ (due to charging/discharging the double layer).\n$$ j = j_f + j_c $$\nThe capacitive current density is related to the rate of change of the overpotential $\\eta$ (the potential difference across the interface relative to its equilibrium value) and the double-layer capacitance per unit area, $C'_{\\mathrm{dl}}$, by $j_c = C'_{\\mathrm{dl}} \\frac{d\\eta}{dt}$.\nFor small sinusoidal perturbations, the Butler-Volmer equation can be linearized around the equilibrium potential ($\\eta=0$). The relationship between the faradaic current density and the overpotential becomes approximately linear:\n$$ j_f \\approx j_0 \\frac{nF}{RT} \\eta $$\nwhere $j_0$ is the exchange current density, $n$ is the number of electrons transferred, $F$ is the Faraday constant, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe charge-transfer resistance per unit area, $R'_{\\mathrm{ct}}$, is defined as the proportionality constant between $\\eta$ and $j_f$:\n$$ R'_{\\mathrm{ct}} = \\frac{\\eta}{j_f} = \\frac{RT}{nFj_0} $$\nThe total charge-transfer resistance for an electrode of area $A$ is $R_{\\mathrm{ct}} = R'_{\\mathrm{ct}}/A$, and the total double-layer capacitance is $C_{\\mathrm{dl}} = C'_{\\mathrm{dl}}A$. The total current $I=jA$ is then:\n$$ I = \\frac{\\eta}{R_{\\mathrm{ct}}} + C_{\\mathrm{dl}}\\frac{d\\eta}{dt} $$\nIn the frequency domain, with a sinusoidal perturbation of angular frequency $\\omega$ (i.e., $\\eta(t) = \\tilde{\\eta}e^{i\\omega t}$ and $I(t) = \\tilde{I}e^{i\\omega t}$), this equation becomes:\n$$ \\tilde{I} = \\frac{\\tilde{\\eta}}{R_{\\mathrm{ct}}} + i\\omega C_{\\mathrm{dl}}\\tilde{\\eta} = \\tilde{\\eta} \\left( \\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{ct}}} + i\\omega C_{\\mathrm{dl}} \\right) $$\nThe impedance of the interface, $Z_{int}$, is the ratio of the potential phasor to the current phasor:\n$$ Z_{int}(\\omega) = \\frac{\\tilde{\\eta}}{\\tilde{I}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{R_{\\mathrm{ct}}} + i\\omega C_{\\mathrm{dl}}} $$\nThis is the impedance of a parallel combination of $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{dl}}$. In a Nyquist plot ($-Im(Z)$ vs $Re(Z)$), this expression describes a perfect semicircle with its diameter on the real axis, starting at the origin for $\\omega \\to \\infty$ and ending at $(R_{\\mathrm{ct}}, 0)$ for $\\omega \\to 0$. The diameter of this semicircle is exactly $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$. The fitting algorithm described in the problem assumes this ideal model and identifies the semicircle diameter as the estimated $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$.\n\n**b. Exchange Current Density Dependence**\nThe problem states that the exchange current density depends on the interfacial lithium-ion concentration $c$ as $j_0(c) = k c^{\\alpha}$, where $k$ and $\\alpha$ are positive constants. Consequently, the charge-transfer resistance is also a function of concentration:\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{ct}}(c) = \\frac{RT}{nFAj_0(c)} = \\frac{RT}{nFAkc^{\\alpha}} $$\n\n### 2. Analysis of Non-Ideal Effects and Bias\n\n**a. Effect of Uncompensated Resistance ($R_u$)**\nThe reference electrode is at a finite distance $\\ell > 0$ from the working electrode, resulting in an uncompensated electrolyte resistance $R_u > 0$. According to Ohm's law, the AC current $\\tilde{I}$ flowing through this portion of the electrolyte creates a potential drop $\\tilde{I}R_u$. The total potential difference measured by the potentiostat between the working and reference electrodes is the sum of the interfacial overpotential $\\tilde{\\eta}$ and this ohmic drop:\n$$ \\tilde{E}_{meas} = \\tilde{\\eta} + \\tilde{I}R_u $$\nThe measured impedance $Z_{meas}$ is therefore:\n$$ Z_{meas} = \\frac{\\tilde{E}_{meas}}{\\tilde{I}} = \\frac{\\tilde{\\eta}}{\\tilde{I}} + R_u = Z_{int} + R_u $$\nIn the Nyquist plot, this corresponds to the ideal semicircle of $Z_{int}$ being shifted to the right along the real axis by the value $R_u$. The high-frequency intercept (where $\\omega \\to \\infty$ and $Z_{int} \\to 0$) is at $(R_u, 0)$, and the low-frequency intercept (where $\\omega \\to 0$ and $Z_{int} \\to R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$) is at $(R_u + R_{\\mathrm{ct}}, 0)$. The diameter of the semicircle is $(R_u + R_{\\mathrm{ct}}) - R_u = R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$.\nThe problem states that the algorithm \"assum[es] an ideally placed reference electrode ($R_u=0$)\". An algorithm that makes this assumption but is fitted to data where $R_u > 0$ may misinterpret the data. If the algorithm is simplistic and does not have a separate parameter for series resistance, it might attempt to fit a model like $Z_{model} = \\frac{R'_{\\mathrm{ct}}}{1+i\\omega C'_{\\mathrm{dl}}}$ to the measured data $Z_{meas} = R_u + Z_{int}$. In such a fit, the constant offset $R_u$ would be absorbed into the fitted parameters, typically by increasing the fitted charge-transfer resistance to account for the larger span of the data on the real axis. This would cause the reported $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$ to be biased high.\n\n**b. Effect of $iR$ Compensation**\nThe problem describes partial or erroneous $iR$ compensation. The logic of compensation is to subtract a voltage term proportional to the current to account for ohmic drops. Let the total resistance to be compensated be $R_u$, and the amount compensated be $R_{comp} = f_c R_{est}$. The net effect on the measured impedance spectrum is a shift of the real axis component. The effective series resistance becomes $R_{s,eff} = R_u - R_{comp}$.\n*   **Undercompensation ($R_{comp}  R_u$)**: A residual positive resistance $R_{s,eff} > 0$ remains. This is the scenario discussed in part (a).\n*   **Overcompensation ($R_{comp} > R_u$)**: The effective series resistance $R_{s,eff} = R_u - R_{comp}$ becomes negative. The measured impedance is $Z_{meas} = R_{s,eff} + Z_{int}$. This shifts the entire Nyquist plot to the left, potentially into the negative real half-plane. This condition often leads to instability in the potentiostat's control loop, which manifests as high-frequency artifacts, most commonly an \"inductive loop\" where the impedance trace crosses the real axis and enters the $Im(Z)>0$ quadrant. When a simple Randles model (which is purely capacitive and cannot produce an inductive loop) is force-fit to such distorted data, the algorithm struggles. The inductive distortion effectively \"cuts short\" the capacitive semicircle. The fitting procedure, trying to match the distorted arc, will typically converge on a semicircle with a smaller diameter than the true $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$. This results in a downward bias in the reported $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$.\n\n**c. Effect of Concentration Gradient**\nAfter a polarization pulse, a concentration gradient exists, such that the interfacial concentration $c_{\\mathrm{WE}}$ is lower than the bulk concentration $c_b$. Specifically, $c_{\\mathrm{WE}} = c_b - \\Delta c$ with $\\Delta c > 0$. The charge-transfer resistance is measured at this depleted interfacial concentration. The true $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$ of the interface is therefore:\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{ct},true} = R_{\\mathrm{ct}}(c_{\\mathrm{WE}}) = \\frac{RT}{nFAk(c_{\\mathrm{WE}})^{\\alpha}} $$\nThe algorithm, however, assumes a uniform concentration $c=c_b$. The \"ideal\" charge-transfer resistance corresponding to this assumption would be:\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{ct},ideal} = R_{\\mathrm{ct}}(c_b) = \\frac{RT}{nFAk(c_b)^{\\alpha}} $$\nSince $c_{\\mathrm{WE}}  c_b$ and $\\alpha > 0$, it follows that $(c_{\\mathrm{WE}})^{\\alpha}  (c_b)^{\\alpha}$. Because $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$ is inversely proportional to this term, we have:\n$$ R_{\\mathrm{ct},true} > R_{\\mathrm{ct},ideal} $$\nThe algorithm measures the semicircle diameter, which physically corresponds to $R_{\\mathrm{ct},true}$. It then reports this value. Therefore, the estimated $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$ is biased high relative to the value that would be obtained in the absence of a concentration gradient (i.e., at the bulk concentration).\n\n### 3. Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. If the reference electrode is within the current field at a distance $\\ell0$ from the working electrode, the measured impedance contains a series $R_{u}0$. If the fit does not explicitly include $R_{u}$, part of the real-axis shift is misattributed to the semicircle, biasing the reported $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$ upward.**\nThis statement is consistent with our analysis in 2.a. A fitting algorithm that assumes $R_u=0$ but is applied to data with $R_u0$ will incorporate the un-modeled real-axis shift into the parameters it can adjust. For a simple Randles model, this will lead to an overestimation of the semicircle diameter ($R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$).\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Applying partial $iR$ compensation with a fraction $0f_{c}1$ always removes the impact of $R_{u}$ on the measured impedance, ensuring the reported $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$ is unbiased.**\nThis is incorrect. Partial compensation, by definition, does not fully remove the uncompensated resistance. If $R_{est} \\approx R_u$, the residual resistance is $(1-f_c)R_u$, which is greater than zero for $f_c  1$. The word \"always\" makes the statement definitively false, as it fails even in the best-case scenario where $R_{est}=R_u$. The impact is reduced, but not eliminated.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. If $c_{\\mathrm{WE}}=c_{b}-\\Delta c$ with $\\Delta c0$ and $j_{0}(c)=k c^{\\alpha}$, then using $c=c_{b}$ to interpret the semicircle diameter underestimates the true $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$, because the actual $j_{0}$ is lower at the interface.**\nThis statement describes a comparison. The \"true $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$\" is the actual resistance of the interface during the experiment, which is $R_{\\mathrm{ct},true} = R_{\\mathrm{ct}}(c_{\\mathrm{WE}})$. \"Using $c=c_b$ to interpret\" means calculating a theoretical resistance based on the bulk concentration, which is $R_{\\mathrm{ct},ideal} = R_{\\mathrm{ct}}(c_b)$. As derived in 2.c, because $c_{\\mathrm{WE}}  c_b$, the actual exchange current density $j_0(c_{\\mathrm{WE}})$ is lower than $j_0(c_b)$. Since $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$ is inversely proportional to $j_0$, we have $R_{\\mathrm{ct},true} > R_{\\mathrm{ct},ideal}$. Therefore, the value calculated based on the bulk concentration ($R_{\\mathrm{ct},ideal}$) is indeed an underestimation of the true, physically present resistance ($R_{\\mathrm{ct},true}$). The reasoning provided (\"because the actual $j_0$ is lower at the interface\") is also correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Electrolyte concentration gradients influence only mass-transport impedance and have no effect on $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$ in the linear small-signal limit, so the reported $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$ remains unbiased by c-variations.**\nThis is incorrect. As shown in the analysis for C, the steady-state concentration at the interface, $c_{\\mathrm{WE}}$, directly sets the exchange current density $j_0$, which in turn determines the value of $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$. Concentration gradients establish the value of $c_{\\mathrm{WE}}$ and therefore have a direct effect on $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$. While concentration *fluctuations* in response to the AC signal give rise to mass-transport impedance (like the Warburg element, often seen at lower frequencies), the background concentration *level* itself sets the kinetic parameters like $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. If the potentiostat overcompensates the electrolyte resistance (effectively $f_{c}1$ relative to the true $R_{u}$), the net real-axis shift can be subtracted excessively, shrinking the semicircle and biasing the reported $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$ downward.**\nThis statement describes the practical consequence of overcompensation, as analyzed in 2.b. Overcompensation leads to a negative effective series resistance, causing artifacts in the measured impedance, typically a high-frequency inductive loop. This distortion \"shrinks\" the apparent shape of the capacitive semicircle. A simple Randles fitting algorithm, when applied to this distorted data, will underestimate the true diameter ($R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$) in an attempt to fit the malformed arc. This results in a downward bias for the reported $R_{\\mathrm{ct}}$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**",

In Galvanostatic Intermittent Titration Technique (GITT), the parameter $dU/dc_{s}$ appears in the analysis linking small changes in surface stoichiometry to small changes in equilibrium voltage; under hysteresis, the appropriate $dU/dc_{s}$ used in GITT must be adjusted to reflect the underlying equilibrium response rather than a single-path branch.\n\nYou are provided with polynomial fits (obtained after sufficiently long rest times to remove diffusion gradients and ohmic drops) to the measured charge and discharge OCV curves of a layered oxide positive electrode at $T = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$:\n$$U_{\\mathrm{ch}}(c_{s}) = 3.88 - 0.315\\,c_{s} + 0.058\\,c_{s}^{2} - 0.010\\,c_{s}^{3},$$\n$$U_{\\mathrm{dis}}(c_{s}) = 3.82 - 0.285\\,c_{s} + 0.042\\,c_{s}^{2} - 0.010\\,c_{s}^{3}.$$\n\nAssume these functions are valid locally near $c_{s} = 0.55$, the hysteresis arises from an additive path-dependent term that changes sign between charge and discharge, and the GITT pulse is small enough that linearization about $c_{s} = 0.55$ is justified. Using first principles, compute the hysteresis offset at $c_{s} = 0.55$ from the provided OCV curves, and then determine the adjusted derivative $dU_{\\mathrm{eq}}/dc_{s}$ at $c_{s} = 0.55$ suitable for use in GITT analysis.\n\nExpress the final reported quantity as the adjusted derivative $dU_{\\mathrm{eq}}/dc_{s}$ at $c_{s} = 0.55$ in units of volts per stoichiometry.

OCV hysteresis is a known phenomenon in battery materials, and its representation as a deviation from a true equilibrium potential is a standard modeling approach. GITT is a common characterization technique where the thermodynamic factor $dU/dc_{s}$ is a key parameter. The provided voltage functions are realistic for layered oxide cathodes.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is clearly defined. The assumption of an additive, sign-changing hysteresis term provides a direct method to calculate the underlying equilibrium potential and its derivative. All necessary information is provided.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative terms, free of subjective or ambiguous language.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\n-   The problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe problem describes voltage hysteresis, where the measured charge and discharge open-circuit voltages, $U_{\\mathrm{ch}}(c_{s})$ and $U_{\\mathrm{dis}}(c_{s})$, deviate from a true, path-independent equilibrium voltage, $U_{\\mathrm{eq}}(c_{s})$. Based on the provided physical description, this behavior can be modeled by introducing a hysteresis energy term. The measured voltages are represented as:\n$$U_{\\mathrm{ch}}(c_{s}) = U_{\\mathrm{eq}}(c_{s}) + U_{\\mathrm{hys}}(c_{s})$$\n$$U_{\\mathrm{dis}}(c_{s}) = U_{\\mathrm{eq}}(c_{s}) - U_{\\mathrm{hys}}(c_{s})$$\nwhere $U_{\\mathrm{hys}}(c_{s})$ is the magnitude of the voltage deviation from equilibrium, assumed to be positive. The total hysteresis offset at a given stoichiometry is the difference between the charge and discharge curves, which is $2U_{\\mathrm{hys}}(c_{s})$.\n\nFirst, as requested, we compute the hysteresis offset at $c_{s} = 0.55$. This is given by the difference $U_{\\mathrm{ch}}(0.55) - U_{\\mathrm{dis}}(0.55)$.\nUsing the provided polynomials:\n$$U_{\\mathrm{ch}}(c_{s}) - U_{\\mathrm{dis}}(c_{s}) = (3.88 - 3.82) - (0.315 - 0.285)c_{s} + (0.058 - 0.042)c_{s}^{2} - (0.010 - 0.010)c_{s}^{3}$$\n$$U_{\\mathrm{ch}}(c_{s}) - U_{\\mathrm{dis}}(c_{s}) = 0.06 - 0.030\\,c_{s} + 0.016\\,c_{s}^{2}$$\nEvaluating at $c_{s} = 0.55$:\n$$U_{\\mathrm{ch}}(0.55) - U_{\\mathrm{dis}}(0.55) = 0.06 - 0.030(0.55) + 0.016(0.55)^{2}$$\n$$= 0.06 - 0.0165 + 0.016(0.3025)$$\n$$= 0.0435 + 0.00484 = 0.04834\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nThis is the hysteresis offset value.\n\nFor GITT analysis, the relevant quantity is the derivative of the true equilibrium potential, $dU_{\\mathrm{eq}}/dc_{s}$. We can find the expression for $U_{\\mathrm{eq}}(c_{s})$ by averaging the charge and discharge voltage equations:\n$$U_{\\mathrm{eq}}(c_{s}) = \\frac{U_{\\mathrm{ch}}(c_{s}) + U_{\\mathrm{dis}}(c_{s})}{2}$$\nSubstituting the given polynomials:\n$$U_{\\mathrm{eq}}(c_{s}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (3.88 + 3.82) - (0.315 + 0.285)c_{s} + (0.058 + 0.042)c_{s}^{2} - (0.010 + 0.010)c_{s}^{3} \\right]$$\n$$U_{\\mathrm{eq}}(c_{s}) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ 7.70 - 0.600\\,c_{s} + 0.100\\,c_{s}^{2} - 0.020\\,c_{s}^{3} \\right]$$\n$$U_{\\mathrm{eq}}(c_{s}) = 3.85 - 0.300\\,c_{s} + 0.050\\,c_{s}^{2} - 0.010\\,c_{s}^{3}$$\nThis polynomial represents the underlying equilibrium OCV curve, free from path-dependent hysteresis effects.\n\nThe adjusted derivative required for GITT analysis is the derivative of this equilibrium potential with respect to the lithium site fraction, $c_{s}$:\n$$\\frac{dU_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{dc_{s}} = \\frac{d}{dc_{s}} \\left( 3.85 - 0.300\\,c_{s} + 0.050\\,c_{s}^{2} - 0.010\\,c_{s}^{3} \\right)$$\n$$\\frac{dU_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{dc_{s}} = -0.300 + 2(0.050)c_{s} - 3(0.010)c_{s}^{2}$$\n$$\\frac{dU_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{dc_{s}} = -0.300 + 0.100\\,c_{s} - 0.030\\,c_{s}^{2}$$\nNow, we evaluate this derivative at the specified point, $c_{s} = 0.55$:\n$$\\left. \\frac{dU_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{dc_{s}} \\right|_{c_{s}=0.55} = -0.300 + 0.100(0.55) - 0.030(0.55)^{2}$$\nFirst, we calculate $(0.55)^2 = 0.3025$.\n$$\\left. \\frac{dU_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{dc_{s}} \\right|_{c_{s}=0.55} = -0.300 + 0.055 - 0.030(0.3025)$$\n$$\\left. \\frac{dU_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{dc_{s}} \\right|_{c_{s}=0.55} = -0.300 + 0.055 - 0.009075$$\n$$\\left. \\frac{dU_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{dc_{s}} \\right|_{c_{s}=0.55} = -0.245 - 0.009075 = -0.254075$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\nThe calculated value is $-0.254075$. Rounding to four significant figures gives $-0.2541$. The units are volts per stoichiometry, as it is a derivative of voltage with respect to a dimensionless fraction.",
