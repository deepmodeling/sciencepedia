A full solution will be provided.\n\n### **Solution Derivation and Calculation**\n\nThe problem requires deriving the expression for the net interfacial current density, $i$, based on first principles of electrochemical kinetics. The rates of the forward (anodic) and backward (cathodic) reactions are described by an Arrhenius-type dependence on the activation energy, which is modulated by the interfacial overpotential, $\\eta$.\n\nLet us consider a single elementary electron-transfer step. The reaction rate is proportional to $\\exp(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger}{RT})$, where $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$ is the Gibbs free energy of activation. In an electrochemical system, this activation barrier is an electrochemical potential energy barrier. The overpotential $\\eta$ is the deviation of the electrode potential from its equilibrium value. A positive overpotential (anodic polarization) drives oxidation, while a negative overpotential (cathodic polarization) drives reduction.\n\nThe electrical component of the Gibbs free energy of activation is partitioned between the anodic and cathodic processes by the transfer coefficients, $\\alpha_a$ and $\\alpha_c$. For a single-electron transfer process ($z=1$), the activation barrier for the anodic reaction is lowered by an amount $\\alpha_a F \\eta$, and the barrier for the cathodic reaction is raised by $\\alpha_c F \\eta$.\n\nThe anodic current density, $i_a$, and the cathodic current density, $i_c$, can be expressed in terms of the exchange current density, $i_0$. The exchange current density represents the magnitude of the equal and opposite anodic and cathodic currents at equilibrium ($\\eta = 0$).\n\nBased on the Arrhenius dependence, the anodic and cathodic current densities are:\n$$ i_a = i_0 \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_a F \\eta}{RT}\\right) $$\n$$ i_c = i_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha_c F \\eta}{RT}\\right) $$\nHere, the exponential term $\\exp(\\frac{\\alpha_a F \\eta}{RT})$ represents the acceleration of the anodic reaction due to the overpotential, and $\\exp(-\\frac{\\alpha_c F \\eta}{RT})$ represents the deceleration of the cathodic reaction.\n\nThe net interfacial current density, $i$, is the difference between the anodic and cathodic current densities:\n$$ i = i_a - i_c $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $i_a$ and $i_c$ yields the Butler-Volmer equation, which is the thermodynamically consistent expression requested:\n$$ i = i_0 \\left[ \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_a F \\eta}{RT}\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha_c F \\eta}{RT}\\right) \\right] $$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $i$ using the provided parameters:\n- $i_0 = 2\\,\\text{A/m}^2$\n- $\\alpha_a = 0.5$\n- $\\alpha_c = 0.5$\n- $T = 298\\,\\text{K}$\n- $\\eta = 25\\,\\text{mV} = 0.025\\,\\text{V}$\n- $R = 8.314\\,\\text{J/(mol·K)}$\n- $F = 96485\\,\\text{C/mol}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the dimensionless group $\\frac{F\\eta}{RT}$:\n$$ \\frac{F\\eta}{RT} = \\frac{(96485\\,\\text{C/mol}) \\times (0.025\\,\\text{V})}{(8.314\\,\\text{J/(mol·K)}) \\times (298\\,\\text{K})} = \\frac{2412.125}{2477.572} \\approx 0.973584 $$\n\nSince $\\alpha_a = \\alpha_c = 0.5$, the arguments for the exponential functions are:\n$$ \\frac{\\alpha_a F \\eta}{RT} = 0.5 \\times 0.973584 = 0.486792 $$\n$$ -\\frac{\\alpha_c F \\eta}{RT} = -0.5 \\times 0.973584 = -0.486792 $$\n\nNow, substitute these into the Butler-Volmer equation:\n$$ i = 2 \\left[ \\exp(0.486792) - \\exp(-0.486792) \\right] $$\nCalculating the exponential terms:\n$$ \\exp(0.486792) \\approx 1.627054 $$\n$$ \\exp(-0.486792) \\approx 0.614604 $$\nSubstituting these values back into the equation for $i$:\n$$ i = 2 \\times (1.627054 - 0.614604) = 2 \\times 1.01245 = 2.0249\\,\\text{A/m}^2 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ i \\approx 2.025\\,\\text{A/m}^2 $$\nThis expression can also be written using the hyperbolic sine function, $\\sinh(x) = \\frac{\\exp(x) - \\exp(-x)}{2}$:\n$$ i = i_0 \\left[2 \\sinh\\left(\\frac{\\alpha F \\eta}{RT}\\right)\\right] = 2i_0 \\sinh\\left(\\frac{F \\eta}{2RT}\\right) \\quad (\\text{for } \\alpha_a=\\alpha_c=0.5=\\alpha) $$\n$$ i = 2 \\times 2 \\times \\sinh(0.486792) = 4 \\times 0.506225 = 2.0249\\,\\text{A/m}^2 $$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $2.025\\,\\text{A/m}^2$.\n\nNext, we determine the dominant branch.

The derivation will be based on Fick's first law and geometric projection arguments as instructed.\n\nLet the macroscopic transport direction be along the $x$-axis. The macroscopic flux $J_{x}$ is related to the macroscopic concentration gradient, $\\frac{dC}{dx}$, by Fick's first law for the homogenized medium:\n$$\nJ_{x} = -D_{\\text{eff}} \\frac{dC}{dx}\n$$\nFor a sample of thickness $L$ with a concentration difference $\\Delta C$ across it, the gradient is $\\frac{\\Delta C}{L}$ (assuming a linear profile), so:\n$$\nJ_{x} = -D_{\\text{eff}} \\frac{\\Delta C}{L}\n$$\nNow, we consider the process at the microscopic level of a single, representative tortuous path. The local flux vector, $\\mathbf{j}$, within the pore phase is given by Fick's law:\n$$\n\\mathbf{j} = -D_{0} \\nabla c\n$$\nwhere $c$ is the local concentration and $D_0$ is the intrinsic diffusivity in the bulk electrolyte.\n\nThe problem asks for a geometric projection argument. Let us consider the flux along a tortuous path. Let $s$ be the coordinate along the path, and $\\mathbf{s}$ be the unit tangent vector to the path. The component of the flux along the path is $j_s = \\mathbf{j} \\cdot \\mathbf{s}$.\n$$\nj_s = (-D_{0} \\nabla c) \\cdot \\mathbf{s} = -D_{0} \\frac{dc}{ds}\n$$\nBecause the diffusion is at steady-state and we neglect constriction effects (i.e., the channel's cross-sectional area is constant), the flux magnitude $j_s$ must be constant along the entire length of a given path to ensure mass conservation. We can integrate the expression for $j_s$ along the average path length, $L_{\\text{eff}}$, from one face of the RVE to the other. The total concentration drop along this path is the macroscopic concentration drop, $\\Delta C$.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\Delta C} dc = \\int_{0}^{L_{\\text{eff}}} -\\frac{j_s}{D_{0}} ds\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta C = -\\frac{j_s L_{\\text{eff}}}{D_{0}} \\implies j_s = -D_{0} \\frac{\\Delta C}{L_{\\text{eff}}}\n$$\nThis expression gives the magnitude of the flux along the winding microscopic path. The macroscopic flux, $J_x$, is the average of the $x$-component of the microscopic flux vector, $\\mathbf{j}$. The vector $\\mathbf{j}$ has magnitude $j_s$ and direction $\\mathbf{s}$, so $\\mathbf{j} = j_s \\mathbf{s}$.\nLet $\\theta$ be the angle between the local path direction $\\mathbf{s}$ and the macroscopic transport direction $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$. The $x$-component of the local flux is $j_x = \\mathbf{j} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{x}} = j_s \\cos(\\theta)$.\n\nThe macroscopic flux $J_x$ is the average of $j_x$ over the ensemble of paths.\n$$\nJ_x = \\langle j_x \\rangle = \\langle j_s \\cos(\\theta) \\rangle\n$$\nAssuming the flux magnitude $j_s$ is uniform for the ensemble of representative paths (a consequence of the averaging process), we can write:\n$$\nJ_x = j_s \\langle \\cos(\\theta) \\rangle\n$$\nNext, we need to find $\\langle \\cos(\\theta) \\rangle$. This term relates the average geometry of the paths to the macroscopic dimension. The differential length along a path is $dl$, and its projection onto the $x$-axis is $dx = dl \\cos(\\theta)$. Integrating over a single path from one end to the other gives the macroscopic thickness $L$:\n$$\nL = \\int_{0}^{L_{\\text{path}}} \\cos(\\theta) dl\n$$\nAveraging over the ensemble of paths, and noting that the average path length is $L_{\\text{eff}}$:\n$$\nL = \\left\\langle \\int_{0}^{L_{\\text{path}}} \\cos(\\theta) dl \\right\\rangle\n$$\nBy assuming that $\\langle \\cos(\\theta) \\rangle$ represents a stationary average property of the statistically isotropic medium, we can approximate the average of the integral as the integral of the average, over the average length:\n$$\nL \\approx \\int_{0}^{L_{\\text{eff}}} \\langle \\cos(\\theta) \\rangle dl = \\langle \\cos(\\theta) \\rangle L_{\\text{eff}}\n$$\nThis gives a key geometric relationship:\n$$\n\\langle \\cos(\\theta) \\rangle = \\frac{L}{L_{\\text{eff}}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $j_s$ and $\\langle \\cos(\\theta) \\rangle$ back into the equation for $J_x$:\n$$\nJ_x = \\left(-D_{0} \\frac{\\Delta C}{L_{\\text{eff}}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{L}{L_{\\text{eff}}}\\right) = -D_{0} \\frac{\\Delta C}{L} \\left(\\frac{L}{L_{\\text{eff}}}\\right)^2\n$$\nComparing this result with the macroscopic Fick's law, $J_{x} = -D_{\\text{eff}} \\frac{\\Delta C}{L}$, we can identify the effective diffusivity:\n$$\nD_{\\text{eff}} = D_{0} \\left(\\frac{L}{L_{\\text{eff}}}\\right)^2\n$$\nThis completes the required derivation.\n\nNow, we perform the numerical calculations.\n\n1) Compute the geometric tortuosity, $\\tau_{g}$.\nThe problem defines $\\tau_g$ as the ratio of average geodesic length to straight-line thickness. This is precisely the given path elongation ratio.\n$$\n\\tau_{g} = \\frac{L_{\\text{eff}}}{L}\n$$\nGiven $L_{\\text{eff}}/L = 2.1$, we have:\n$$\n\\tau_{g} = 2.1\n$$\nReporting to four significant figures, $\\tau_{g} = 2.100$.\n\n2) Compute the tortuosity-only diffusivity reduction factor, $f_{D}$.\nThe problem defines this factor as $f_{D} = D_{\\text{eff}}/D_{0}$. From our derivation:\n$$\n\\frac{D_{\\text{eff}}}{D_{0}} = \\left(\\frac{L}{L_{\\text{eff}}}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{L_{\\text{eff}}/L}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\tau_{g}^2}\n$$\nSo, the reduction factor is:\n$$\nf_{D} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_{g}^2}\n$$\nSubstituting the value of $\\tau_g$:\n$$\nf_{D} = \\frac{1}{(2.1)^2} = \\frac{1}{4.41} \\approx 0.226757369...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\nf_{D} = 0.2268\n$$\nThe problem asks for the final numerical results for the pair $[\\tau_{g}, f_{D}]$ as a row vector.\nThe pair is $[2.100, 0.2268]$.",
