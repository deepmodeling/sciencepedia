            "introduction": "To understand whether an electrode material will intercalate ions uniformly (solid-solution) or separate into ion-rich and ion-poor regions (phase separation), we must start with its thermodynamics. The regular solution model provides a simple but powerful framework for this, capturing the essential competition between the entropy of mixing and the enthalpy of interaction. This first practice guides you through a foundational derivation to determine the critical temperature, $T_c$, which is the threshold that separates purely solid-solution behavior from the possibility of phase separation, based on the curvature of the Helmholtz free energy curve.",

            "problem": "An automated materials design workflow for intercalation electrodes must decide whether to activate phase-field simulation for phase separation or a simpler homogeneous model. The decision is based on the convexity of the homogeneous Helmholtz free energy per intercalation site as a function of the lithium filling fraction. Consider a host lattice with one intercalation site per lattice position, where the lithium filling fraction is $c \\in (0,1)$, the temperature is $T$, and the mean-field interaction parameter is $\\Omega  0$ (energy per site). The per-site Helmholtz free energy is modeled by the widely used regular solution form\n$$\ng(c,T) = k_{B} T \\left[c \\ln c + (1-c) \\ln (1-c)\\right] + \\Omega\\, c(1-c),\n$$\nwhere $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant. In this workflow, a miscibility gap is flagged when the free energy becomes non-convex in composition, namely when there exists $c \\in (0,1)$ such that the second derivative $g''(c)  0$. Using the definition of convexity and the free energy model above, derive from first principles the closed-form expression for the highest temperature at which the free energy can be non-convex for some $c \\in (0,1)$, that is, the minimal temperature threshold separating solid-solution behavior from the possibility of phase separation. Provide this temperature as a single analytical expression in terms of $\\Omega$ and $k_{B}$. Express your final answer in Kelvin. Do not introduce any empirical fitting parameters beyond those specified. The final result must be a single closed-form analytic expression.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the critical temperature, $T_c$, which marks the boundary between solid-solution behavior and the onset of phase separation in a host lattice for intercalation. This boundary is defined by the convexity of the Helmholtz free energy per site, $g(c,T)$, as a function of the lithium filling fraction, $c$.\n\nThe provided model for the Helmholtz free energy per site is the regular solution model:\n$$\ng(c,T) = k_{B} T \\left[c \\ln c + (1-c) \\ln (1-c)\\right] + \\Omega\\, c(1-c)\n$$\nwhere $c$ is the filling fraction, $c \\in (0,1)$, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $\\Omega  0$ is the mean-field interaction parameter. The first term represents the entropy of mixing, and the second term represents the enthalpy of mixing.\n\nPhase separation is thermodynamically favored when the free energy curve $g(c)$ is non-convex for some range of compositions. A function is non-convex where its second derivative is negative. The problem statement defines this condition for a miscibility gap as the existence of a composition $c \\in (0,1)$ such that the second derivative with respect to composition is negative:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial c^2}  0\n$$\n\nTo find the temperature threshold, we must first compute this second derivative. We begin with the first derivative of $g(c,T)$ with respect to $c$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial c} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial c} \\left( k_{B} T \\left[c \\ln c + (1-c) \\ln (1-c)\\right] + \\Omega c - \\Omega c^2 \\right)\n$$\nUsing the product rule for differentiation on the logarithmic terms:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial c} = k_{B} T \\left[ \\left(1 \\cdot \\ln c + c \\cdot \\frac{1}{c}\\right) + \\left(-1 \\cdot \\ln(1-c) + (1-c) \\cdot \\frac{-1}{1-c}\\right) \\right] + \\Omega(1 - 2c)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial c} = k_{B} T \\left[ (\\ln c + 1) - (\\ln(1-c) + 1) \\right] + \\Omega(1 - 2c)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial c} = k_{B} T \\left[ \\ln c - \\ln(1-c) \\right] + \\Omega(1 - 2c) = k_{B} T \\ln\\left(\\frac{c}{1-c}\\right) + \\Omega(1 - 2c)\n$$\nThis expression is proportional to the difference between the chemical potential of the intercalated species and the chemical potential of a vacancy.\n\nNext, we compute the second derivative, $\\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial c^2}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial c^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial c} \\left( k_{B} T \\left[ \\ln c - \\ln(1-c) \\right] + \\Omega(1 - 2c) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial c^2} = k_{B} T \\left( \\frac{1}{c} - \\frac{-1}{1-c} \\right) - 2\\Omega\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial c^2} = k_{B} T \\left( \\frac{1}{c} + \\frac{1}{1-c} \\right) - 2\\Omega\n$$\nCombining the terms in the parenthesis:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial c^2} = k_{B} T \\left( \\frac{1-c+c}{c(1-c)} \\right) - 2\\Omega = \\frac{k_{B} T}{c(1-c)} - 2\\Omega\n$$\nThe condition for non-convexity (and thus, for the possibility of phase separation) is $\\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial c^2}  0$:\n$$\n\\frac{k_{B} T}{c(1-c)} - 2\\Omega  0\n$$\nRearranging this inequality to solve for the temperature $T$:\n$$\nT  \\frac{2\\Omega}{k_B} c(1-c)\n$$\nThis inequality shows that for a given temperature $T$, non-convexity occurs if there exists a composition $c \\in (0,1)$ that satisfies this condition. The problem asks for the highest temperature at which non-convexity is possible. This corresponds to the critical temperature, $T_c$. Above $T_c$, the free energy is convex for all compositions (i.e., $\\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial c^2}  0$ for all $c \\in (0,1)$), meaning the material forms a solid solution at all filling fractions. Below $T_c$, there is a range of compositions where phase separation can occur.\n\nThe critical temperature $T_c$ is the boundary case. It is the highest temperature for which the inequality $T  \\frac{2\\Omega}{k_B} c(1-c)$ can be satisfied for some $c$. This requires finding the maximum value of the function $f(c) = c(1-c)$ on the interval $c \\in (0,1)$.\nLet's find the maximum of $f(c) = c - c^2$ by finding its critical points:\n$$\n\\frac{df}{dc} = 1 - 2c\n$$\nSetting the derivative to zero:\n$$\n1 - 2c = 0 \\implies c = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nTo confirm this is a maximum, we check the second derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2f}{dc^2} = -2\n$$\nSince the second derivative is negative, $c = \\frac{1}{2}$ corresponds to a local maximum. As $f(c)$ is a downward-opening parabola, this is the global maximum on the domain $(0,1)$.\nThe maximum value of $c(1-c)$ is therefore:\n$$\nf\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\nThe condition for non-convexity to be possible at any composition is that the temperature $T$ must be less than the maximum value of the right-hand side of the inequality. The critical temperature $T_c$ is exactly this maximum value.\n$$\nT_c = \\frac{2\\Omega}{k_B} \\cdot \\max_{c \\in (0,1)}[c(1-c)]\n$$\nSubstituting the maximum value of $\\frac{1}{4}$:\n$$\nT_c = \\frac{2\\Omega}{k_B} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\n$$\nT_c = \\frac{\\Omega}{2k_B}\n$$\nThis is the highest temperature at which the free energy can be non-convex for some composition $c$. For any temperature $T  T_c$, the condition $T  \\frac{2\\Omega}{k_B} c(1-c)$ holds for all $c \\in (0,1)$, implying $\\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial c^2}  0$ everywhere, and the system is a stable solid solution. For $T  T_c$, there is a continuous range of compositions around $c=\\frac{1}{2}$ for which $\\frac{\\partial^2 g}{\\partial c^2}  0$, defining the spinodal region where phase separation is spontaneous. The derived expression provides the required analytical form in terms of $\\Omega$ and $k_B$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the development of a numerical algorithm to detect two-phase coexistence in a one-component intercalation system. This is achieved by analyzing the dimensionless Gibbs free energy per site, $g(c)$, as a function of the dimensionless composition, $c \\in (0,1)$. The fundamental thermodynamic principle guiding this analysis is that an equilibrium system at constant temperature and pressure minimizes its total Gibbs free energy.\n\nWhen the free energy function $g(c)$ is convex, i.e., $g''(c)  0$ for all $c$, the system exists as a single, homogeneous solid solution at any average composition. However, if $g(c)$ has a region of non-convexity, i.e., $g''(c)  0$, it is energetically favorable for the system to phase-separate into two distinct phases with compositions $c_{\\alpha}$ and $c_{\\beta}$. These compositions are determined by the common tangent construction. The total free energy of this heterogeneous mixture lies on the straight line segment connecting the points $(c_{\\alpha}, g(c_{\\alpha}))$ and $(c_{\\beta}, g(c_{\\beta}))$ on the free energy curve. For this state to be the minimum energy state, this line segment, known as a tie-line, must be a supporting line for the function $g(c)$, meaning the function $g(c)$ must lie on or above this line for all $c \\in [c_{\\alpha}, c_{\\beta}]$.\n\nThis geometric condition is equivalent to the thermodynamic condition for phase equilibrium: the chemical potential, $\\mu(c)$, which is the derivative of the Gibbs free energy per site, $\\mu(c) = g'(c)$, must be equal in the two coexisting phases.\n$$\n\\mu(c_{\\alpha}) = \\mu(c_{\\beta})\n$$\nThe common value of the chemical potential is equal to the slope, $m$, of the common tangent line.\n$$\nm = g'(c_{\\alpha}) = g'(c_{\\beta}) = \\frac{g(c_{\\beta}) - g(c_{\\alpha})}{c_{\\beta} - c_{\\alpha}}\n$$\nThe set of all such tie-lines for a given function $g(c)$ forms the lower convex envelope of the graph of $g(c)$. If the lower convex envelope of $g(c)$ is identical to $g(c)$ itself, no phase separation occurs. If they differ over some interval $[c_{\\alpha}, c_{\\beta}]$, then phase separation occurs, and the compositions of the coexisting phases are precisely $c_{\\alpha}$ and $c_{\\beta}$.\n\nThe algorithmic approach to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1.  **Discretization and Function Evaluation**: The continuous free-energy function $g(c)$ is sampled on a discrete, uniform grid of $N$ points, $\\{c_i\\}_{i=0}^{N-1}$, over the interval $(\\epsilon, 1-\\epsilon)$, where $c_i = \\epsilon + \\frac{i}{N-1} (1 - 2\\epsilon)$. This generates a set of discrete points $\\{(c_i, g_i)\\}_{i=0}^{N-1}$, where $g_i = g(c_i)$.\n\n2.  **Lower Convex Hull Computation**: The lower convex envelope of the continuous function is approximated by the lower convex hull of the set of sampled points. A numerically stable and efficient method for this is the monotone chain algorithm (a variant of Andrew's algorithm). This algorithm processes the points, which are already sorted by their $c$-coordinate, and builds the lower hull by maintaining a chain of vertices that always exhibits a \"left turn\" or remains collinear. For three consecutive points $p_1, p_2, p_3$ sorted by their $c$-coordinate, a left turn is identified if the $z$-component of the cross product of the vectors $\\vec{p_1 p_2}$ and $\\vec{p_1 p_3}$ is non-negative. If adding a new point $p_3$ to a chain ending in $p_1, p_2$ results in a right turn, the point $p_2$ is not part of the lower hull and is removed from the chain. This process is repeated until the chain property is restored, after which $p_3$ is added.\n\n3.  **Tie-Line Identification and Verification**: The vertices of the computed lower convex hull provide candidate tie-lines. A tie-line corresponding to phase separation exists if two non-consecutive grid points $(c_i, g_i)$ and $(c_j, g_j)$ (where the indices satisfy $j - i  1$) become consecutive vertices on the lower convex hull. Each such segment is a candidate that must be rigorously verified against the thermodynamic conditions using the provided numerical tolerances.\n\n    a.  **Numerical Derivative**: The derivative $g'(c)$ is approximated at each grid point $c_i$ using finite differences. A central difference scheme, $g'(c_i) \\approx \\frac{g_{i+1} - g_{i-1}}{c_{i+1} - c_{i-1}}$, is used for interior points ($0  i  N-1$), while one-sided forward and backward differences are used at the grid boundaries $c_0$ and $c_{N-1}$, respectively.\n\n    b.  **Slope Condition**: The slope of the candidate tie-line, $m = \\frac{g_j - g_i}{c_j - c_i}$, must match the numerical derivatives at the endpoints within a tolerance $\\tau_s = 5 \\times 10^{-3}$. That is, $|g'(c_i) - m| \\le \\tau_s$ and $|g'(c_j) - m| \\le \\tau_s$.\n\n    c.  **Supporting Line Condition**: The line segment must lie below or on the free energy curve for all intermediate grid points. This is checked by ensuring that the vertical distance from each point $(c_k, g_k)$ with $i  k  j$ to the line is non-negative, within a tolerance $\\tau_{\\ell} = 1 \\times 10^{-5}$. Formally, $\\min_{ikj} \\left[ g_k - (g_i + m(c_k - c_i)) \\right] \\ge -\\tau_{\\ell}$. To exclude trivial cases of a flat curve segment, it is also required that at least one intermediate point lies strictly above the line: $\\max_{ikj} \\left[ g_k - (g_i + m(c_k - c_i)) \\right]  \\tau_{\\ell}$.\n\n4.  **Result Selection**: The problem specifies that if multiple tie-lines satisfy these conditions, the first one encountered while scanning the hull edges from lower to higher composition $c$ is to be selected. If no segment satisfies all conditions, the system is a single-phase solid solution across the entire composition range, and the result is an empty list. Otherwise, the result is the list $[c_i, c_j]$ corresponding to the identified coexisting phase compositions.",
