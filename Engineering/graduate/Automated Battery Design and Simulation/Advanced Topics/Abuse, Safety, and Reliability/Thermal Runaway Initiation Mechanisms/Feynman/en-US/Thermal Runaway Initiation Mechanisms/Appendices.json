We define a dimensionless temperature, $\\phi$, and a dimensionless spatial coordinate, $\\xi$:\n$$\\phi = \\frac{E(T - T_{\\infty})}{RT_{\\infty}^2} = \\frac{E\\theta}{RT_{\\infty}^2}$$\n$$\\xi = \\frac{x}{L}$$\nFrom these definitions, we can express the derivatives of temperature with respect to $x$ in terms of the dimensionless variables:\n$$T = T_{\\infty} + \\frac{RT_{\\infty}^2}{E}\\phi$$\n$$\\frac{dT}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(T_{\\infty} + \\frac{RT_{\\infty}^2}{E}\\phi\\right) = \\frac{RT_{\\infty}^2}{E} \\frac{d\\phi}{d\\xi} \\frac{d\\xi}{dx} = \\frac{RT_{\\infty}^2}{EL} \\frac{d\\phi}{d\\xi}$$\n$$\\frac{d^2T}{dx^2} = \\frac{RT_{\\infty}^2}{EL} \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{d\\phi}{d\\xi}\\right) = \\frac{RT_{\\infty}^2}{EL^2} \\frac{d^2\\phi}{d\\xi^2}$$\nSubstituting the non-dimensional terms and the Frank-Kamenetskii approximation into the original heat equation:\n$$k\\left(\\frac{RT_{\\infty}^2}{EL^2} \\frac{d^2\\phi}{d\\xi^2}\\right) + Q A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{RT_{\\infty}}\\right) \\exp(\\phi) = 0$$\nRearranging this equation gives the dimensionless form:\n$$\\frac{d^2\\phi}{d\\xi^2} + \\left[ \\frac{L^2 E Q A}{k R T_{\\infty}^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{RT_{\\infty}}\\right) \\right] \\exp(\\phi) = 0$$\nThis equation is of the form $\\frac{d^2\\phi}{d\\xi^2} + \\delta \\exp(\\phi) = 0$, where $\\delta$ is the Frank-Kamenetskii parameter, defined as:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{L^2 E Q A}{k R T_{\\infty}^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{RT_{\\infty}}\\right)$$\nThe dimensionless boundary conditions are:\nAt $x=0$, $\\xi=0$: $\\left.\\frac{dT}{dx}\\right|_{x=0}=0 \\implies \\left.\\frac{d\\phi}{d\\xi}\\right|_{\\xi=0}=0$\nAt $x=L$, $\\xi=1$: $T(L)=T_{\\infty} \\implies \\phi(1)=0$\n\nThe problem states that distributed ignition initiates when the Frank-Kamenetskii parameter, $\\delta$, exceeds a critical value, $\\delta_c$, which is a known constant for the given geometry and boundary conditions. The critical condition is therefore $\\delta = \\delta_c$. Setting our derived expression for $\\delta$ to this critical value allows us to solve for the critical half-thickness, $L$:\n$$\\delta_c = \\frac{L^2 E Q A}{k R T_{\\infty}^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{RT_{\\infty}}\\right)$$\nSolving for $L^2$:\n$$L^2 = \\delta_c \\frac{k R T_{\\infty}^2}{E Q A} \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E}{RT_{\\infty}}\\right)} = \\delta_c \\frac{k R T_{\\infty}^2}{E Q A} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E}{RT_{\\infty}}\\right)$$\nTaking the square root gives the final expression for the critical half-thickness $L$:\n$$L = \\sqrt{\\delta_c \\frac{k R T_{\\infty}^2}{E Q A} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E}{RT_{\\infty}}\\right)}$$\nThe unit of this expression is meters, as confirmed by dimensional analysis.\n\nRegarding the role of the heat transfer coefficient $h$: The general boundary condition at $x=L$ is the Robin (convection) condition, $-k\\frac{dT}{dx}|_{x=L} = h(T(L)-T_{\\infty})$. In dimensionless form, this becomes $\\frac{d\\phi}{d\\xi}|_{\\xi=1} = -\\frac{hL}{k}\\phi(1) = -Bi \\cdot \\phi(1)$, where $Bi$ is the Biot number. The problem specifies the \"high-convective limit\", which corresponds to $h \\to \\infty$. In this limit, the Biot number $Bi \\to \\infty$. For the product $-Bi \\cdot \\phi(1)$ to remain finite (equal to the temperature gradient), the dimensionless surface temperature $\\phi(1)$ must approach zero. This limit, $\\phi(1) \\to 0$, recovers the Dirichlet boundary condition $T(L)=T_{\\infty}$ used in this derivation. Thus, while $h$ provides the physical justification for the simplified boundary condition, it formally drops out of the problem formulation under this assumption and does not appear in the final expression for $L$.",
