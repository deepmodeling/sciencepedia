            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a set of simplifying assumptions common in introductory-level battery modeling to pose a solvable problem in sensitivity analysis. All necessary parameters are provided.\n\nThe objective is to derive the local sensitivity measure $S_{\\varepsilon} = \\partial V/\\partial \\varepsilon$, which quantifies the change in terminal voltage $V$ with respect to a change in electrolyte-filled porosity $\\varepsilon$.\n\nThe terminal voltage $V$ of the cell is the sum of various contributions, including the equilibrium potential, activation overpotentials, and ohmic losses. The problem states that all contributions to the terminal voltage, except for the electrolyte-phase ohmic drop, are to be treated as independent of porosity $\\varepsilon$. We can thus write the terminal voltage as:\n$$V(\\varepsilon) = V_{\\text{other}} - V_{\\Omega,e}(\\varepsilon)$$\nwhere $V_{\\Omega,e}$ is the voltage loss due to ohmic resistance in the electrolyte, and $V_{\\text{other}}$ encapsulates all other voltage contributions, which are constant with respect to $\\varepsilon$.\n\nThe sensitivity $S_{\\varepsilon}$ is the partial derivative of $V$ with respect to $\\varepsilon$:\n$$S_{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial \\varepsilon} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\varepsilon} \\left( V_{\\text{other}} - V_{\\Omega,e}(\\varepsilon) \\right)$$\nSince $V_{\\text{other}}$ is independent of $\\varepsilon$, its derivative is zero.\n$$S_{\\varepsilon} = - \\frac{\\partial V_{\\Omega,e}}{\\partial \\varepsilon}$$\nOur first task is to find an expression for the ohmic voltage loss, $V_{\\Omega,e}$. The problem directs us to use electrolyte charge conservation and Ohm's law. In a one-dimensional system, Ohm's law relates the electrolyte current density $j_e$ to the gradient of the electrolyte potential $\\phi_e$:\n$$j_e(x) = -\\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\frac{d\\phi_e}{dx}$$\nwhere $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is the effective electrolyte conductivity.\n\nThe problem specifies to assume that the macroscopic electrolyte current density is uniform across the effective electrolyte path of length $L_e$. This means $j_e(x)$ is constant and equal to the total applied current density $j = I/A$.\n$$j_e = j = \\frac{I}{A}$$\nWith $j_e$ and $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ constant along the path, the potential gradient $d\\phi_e/dx$ is also constant.

The sensitivity $S_{\\varepsilon} = \\partial V/\\partial \\varepsilon \\approx 1.482\\,$ V has units of volts (as porosity is dimensionless), representing the change in terminal voltage per unit change in porosity. The positive sign indicates that an increase in porosity $\\varepsilon$ leads to an increase in terminal voltage $V$. This is physically consistent: higher porosity increases the effective electrolyte conductivity $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, which reduces the ohmic voltage loss $V_{\\Omega,e}$. Since the terminal voltage is given by $V = V_{\\text{other}} - V_{\\Omega,e}$, a smaller ohmic loss results in a higher terminal voltage. In the context of stochastic modeling, this sensitivity value is a crucial parameter. For small, zero-mean porosity variations $\\delta\\varepsilon$ with variance $\\sigma_{\\varepsilon}^{2}$ across a population of cells, the resulting first-order variation in terminal voltage is $\\delta V \\approx S_{\\varepsilon} \\delta\\varepsilon$. The variance of the voltage can be approximated as $\\sigma_{V}^{2} \\approx S_{\\varepsilon}^{2} \\sigma_{\\varepsilon}^{2}$. Therefore, $S_{\\varepsilon}$ directly relates manufacturing variability in porosity to performance variability in terminal voltage.",

The \"early-time\" condition, $t_{0} \\ll r^{2}/D$, is verifiable with the given mean parameters: $(\\mu_r)^2/\\mu_D = (5.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m})^2 / (1.0 \\times 10^{-14}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) = 2500\\ \\mathrm{s}$, which is much larger than $t_0 = 1.0\\ \\mathrm{s}$, justifying the use of the semi-infinite diffusion approximation.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three main steps: first, we determine the solid-phase concentration at the particle surface as a function of the random variables $r$ and $D$; second, we express the terminal voltage as a function of these variables; and third, we apply the first-order delta method to approximate the variance of this voltage.\n\nStep 1: Surface Concentration in the Early-Time Regime\n\nWe begin with Fick's second law for diffusion in the spherical particle. Under the early-time condition $t \\ll r^2/D$, the diffusion depth is small compared to the particle radius, allowing us to approximate the spherical shell near the surface as a semi-infinite planar medium. The diffusion equation is thus:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c_s}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 c_s}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nwhere $x$ is the spatial coordinate pointing into the particle from its surface. The initial condition is a uniform concentration, $c_s(x, t=0) = c_0$. The boundary condition at the surface ($x=0$) is a constant flux $J$ into the particle, given by:\n$$\n-D \\frac{\\partial c_s}{\\partial x}\\bigg|_{x=0} = J\n$$\nThe solution to this standard transport problem for the concentration at the surface is:\n$$\nc_s^{\\mathrm{surf}}(t) - c_0 = c_s(x=0, t) - c_0 = 2J \\sqrt{\\frac{t}{\\pi D}}\n$$\nThe molar flux $J$ is related to the volumetric current density $i_n$ through Faraday's law and the specific surface area $a_s$. The current per unit active surface area is $i_n/a_s$, so the molar flux is $J = i_n / (F a_s)$. The specific surface area for spherical particles of radius $r$ is given by $a_s = 3\\epsilon_s/r$. Substituting this into the flux expression yields:\n$$\nJ = \\frac{i_n}{F(3\\epsilon_s/r)} = \\frac{i_n r}{3 F \\epsilon_s}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $J$ into the surface concentration equation at time $t_0$, we find the dependence of the surface concentration on the random variables $r$ and $D$:\n$$\nc_s^{\\mathrm{surf}}(t_0) - c_0 = 2 \\left(\\frac{i_n r}{3 F \\epsilon_s}\\right) \\sqrt{\\frac{t_0}{\\pi D}} = \\left( \\frac{2 i_n \\sqrt{t_0}}{3 F \\epsilon_s \\sqrt{\\pi}} \\right) \\frac{r}{\\sqrt{D}}\n$$\n\nStep 2: Terminal Voltage as a Function of $(r,D)$\n\nThe terminal voltage $V(t)$ is approximated by the open-circuit potential $U(c_s^{\\mathrm{surf}}(t))$, which is linearized around the initial concentration $c_0$:\n$$\nV(t_0) \\approx U(c_0) + U'(c_0)(c_s^{\\mathrm{surf}}(t_0) - c_0)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the surface concentration change, we obtain the voltage as a function of $r$ and $D$:\n$$\nV(t_0) \\approx U(c_0) + U'(c_0) \\left( \\frac{2 i_n \\sqrt{t_0}}{3 F \\epsilon_s \\sqrt{\\pi}} \\right) r D^{-1/2}\n$$\nSince $U(c_0)$ is a constant, it does not contribute to the variance. Let us define a function $h(r,D)$ representing the variable part of the voltage:\n$$\nh(r, D) = C_0 r D^{-1/2} \\quad \\text{where} \\quad C_0 = U'(c_0) \\frac{2 i_n \\sqrt{t_0}}{3 F \\epsilon_s \\sqrt{\\pi}}\n$$\nThus, $\\mathrm{Var}[V(t_0)] \\approx \\mathrm{Var}[h(r, D)]$.\n\nStep 3: Variance Calculation using the Delta Method\n\nThe first-order delta method approximates the variance of a function $h(r,D)$ of two correlated random variables $r$ and $D$ as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}[h(r,D)] \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial r}\\right)^2 \\mathrm{Var}[r] + \\left(\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial D}\\right)^2 \\mathrm{Var}[D] + 2\\left(\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial r}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial D}\\right)\\mathrm{Cov}[r,D]\n$$\nwhere the partial derivatives are evaluated at the mean values $(\\mu_r, \\mu_D)$. The variances are $\\mathrm{Var}[r]=\\sigma_r^2$ and $\\mathrm{Var}[D]=\\sigma_D^2$, and the covariance is $\\mathrm{Cov}[r,D] = \\rho \\sigma_r \\sigma_D$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the partial derivatives of $h(r,D) = C_0 r D^{-1/2}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial r} = C_0 D^{-1/2} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\left.\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial r}\\right|_{(\\mu_r, \\mu_D)} = C_0 \\mu_D^{-1/2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial D} = C_0 r \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} D^{-3/2}\\right) \\quad \\implies \\quad \\left.\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial D}\\right|_{(\\mu_r, \\mu_D)} = -\\frac{1}{2} C_0 \\mu_r \\mu_D^{-3/2}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the variance formula:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}[V(t_0)] \\approx (C_0 \\mu_D^{-1/2})^2 \\sigma_r^2 + \\left(-\\frac{1}{2} C_0 \\mu_r \\mu_D^{-3/2}\\right)^2 \\sigma_D^2 + 2(C_0 \\mu_D^{-1/2})\\left(-\\frac{1}{2} C_0 \\mu_r \\mu_D^{-3/2}\\right)\\rho\\sigma_r\\sigma_D\n$$\nSimplifying the expression:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}[V(t_0)] \\approx C_0^2 \\mu_D^{-1}\\sigma_r^2 + \\frac{1}{4} C_0^2 \\mu_r^2 \\mu_D^{-3}\\sigma_D^2 - C_0^2 \\mu_r \\mu_D^{-2}\\rho\\sigma_r\\sigma_D\n$$\nLet $\\mu_h = h(\\mu_r,\\mu_D) = C_0 \\mu_r \\mu_D^{-1/2}$ be the first-order approximation of the mean of $h$. Then $\\mu_h^2 = C_0^2 \\mu_r^2 \\mu_D^{-1}$. We can factor this term out:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}[V(t_0)] \\approx C_0^2 \\mu_r^2 \\mu_D^{-1} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_r}{\\mu_r}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_D}{\\mu_D}\\right)^2 - \\rho\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_r}{\\mu_r}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_D}{\\mu_D}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nThis gives the compact form:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}[V(t_0)] \\approx \\mu_h^2 \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_r}{\\mu_r}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_D}{\\mu_D}\\right)^2 - \\rho\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_r}{\\mu_r}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_D}{\\mu_D}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$i_{n} = 1.0 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{A}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, $t_{0} = 1.0\\ \\mathrm{s}$, $F = 96485\\ \\mathrm{C}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, $\\epsilon_{s} = 0.50$, $U'(c_{0}) = 3.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{V}\\,(\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3})^{-1}$, $\\mu_{r} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$, $\\sigma_{r} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{m}$, $\\mu_{D} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-14}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $\\sigma_{D} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-15}\\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, and $\\rho = 0.40$.\n\nFirst, calculate the mean voltage change, $\\mu_h$:\n$$\n\\mu_h = \\left( (3.0 \\times 10^{-6}) \\frac{2 (1.0 \\times 10^6) \\sqrt{1.0}}{3(96485)(0.50)\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\right) (5.0 \\times 10^{-6}) (1.0 \\times 10^{-14})^{-1/2}\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_h \\approx \\left( \\frac{6.0}{256561.4} \\right) (5.0 \\times 10^{-6})(1.0 \\times 10^7) \\approx (2.33865 \\times 10^{-5})(50) \\approx 1.16933 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{V}\n$$\nSo, $\\mu_h^2 \\approx (1.16933 \\times 10^{-3})^2 \\approx 1.36733 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{V}^2$.\n\nNext, calculate the coefficients of variation (CV):\n$$\nCV_r = \\frac{\\sigma_r}{\\mu_r} = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-7}}{5.0 \\times 10^{-6}} = 0.04\n$$\n$$\nCV_D = \\frac{\\sigma_D}{\\mu_D} = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^{-15}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-14}} = 0.20\n$$\nNow, calculate the term in the square brackets:\n$$\n\\text{Bracket Term} = (CV_r)^2 + \\frac{1}{4}(CV_D)^2 - \\rho(CV_r)(CV_D)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Bracket Term} = (0.04)^2 + \\frac{1}{4}(0.20)^2 - (0.40)(0.04)(0.20)\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Bracket Term} = 0.0016 + 0.25(0.04) - 0.0032 = 0.0016 + 0.01 - 0.0032 = 0.0084\n$$\nFinally, compute the variance:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}[V(t_0)] \\approx \\mu_h^2 \\times (\\text{Bracket Term}) \\approx (1.36733 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times (0.0084) \\approx 1.14856 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{V}^2\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $1.149 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{V}^2$.",
