In automated battery design and simulation, the early-time electric-field distribution in the electrolyte is a key driver for dendrite nucleation. Consider a one-dimensional, isothermal, steady-state situation with negligible solute concentration gradients and no convection so that ionic migration dominates electrolyte charge transport. The local ionic fluxes obey the Nernst–Planck equation, the electrolyte is electroneutral, and charge conservation holds in the pore space.\n\nStarting from the fundamental base that the bulk electrolyte current density obeys Ohm’s law $\\mathbf{i}=-\\kappa\\,\\nabla\\phi$, and using volume averaging over the pore space together with the definitions of porosity $\\epsilon$ and tortuosity $\\tau$ (where tortuosity quantifies the increase in the effective path length of conduction through the pore network), derive an expression for the effective ionic conductivity $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ of the porous medium in terms of the bulk conductivity $\\kappa$, the porosity $\\epsilon$, and the tortuosity $\\tau$.

The critical shear modulus $G_{\\text{crit}}$ is the value of $G$ for which $A = 0$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Omega J}{F} = \\frac{2 j_0 \\alpha \\Omega^2 G_{\\text{crit}}}{F RT} \\implies G_{\\text{crit}} = \\frac{J R T}{2 j_0 \\alpha \\Omega}\n$$\nWhen unstable ($G  G_{\\text{crit}}$), the wavenumber $k^\\star$ with the maximum growth rate $\\omega_{\\text{max}}$ is found by setting $d\\omega/dk = 0$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\omega}{dk} = A - 2Bk = 0 \\implies k^\\star = \\frac{A}{2B} = \\frac{G_{\\text{crit}} - G}{\\gamma}\n$$\nIf $A \\le 0$, the system is stable, so we set $\\omega_{\\text{max}}=0$ and $k^\\star=0$. If $A>0$, the maximum growth rate is $\\omega_{\\text{max}} = \\omega(k^\\star) = \\frac{A^2}{4B}$:\n$$\n\\omega_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{RT}{4 j_0 \\alpha \\gamma F} \\left( J - \\frac{2 j_0 \\alpha \\Omega G}{RT} \\right)^2 = \\frac{RT J^2}{4 j_0 \\alpha \\gamma F} \\left(1 - \\frac{G}{G_{\\text{crit}}}\\right)^2\n$$\nThese formulae are implemented in the accompanying Python code to solve the test cases.",
