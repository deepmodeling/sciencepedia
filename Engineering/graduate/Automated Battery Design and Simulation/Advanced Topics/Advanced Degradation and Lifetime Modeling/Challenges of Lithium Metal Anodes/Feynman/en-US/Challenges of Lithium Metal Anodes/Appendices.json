It is deemed **valid**. The solution will now be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of two quantities: the Coulombic Efficiency ($CE$) for a single cycle and the cumulative irreversible lithium loss over $N=200$ cycles.\n\n**Part 1: Calculation of Coulombic Efficiency (CE)**\n\nThe Coulombic Efficiency is defined as the ratio of the charge stripped from the electrode to the charge plated onto it during a single cycle. Using the provided areal capacity values, which are direct measures of charge per unit area:\n\n$CE = \\frac{Q_{\\mathrm{strip}}}{Q_{\\mathrm{plate}}}$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n$Q_{\\mathrm{plate}} = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{mAh\\,cm^{-2}}$\n$Q_{\\mathrm{strip}} = 1.98\\,\\mathrm{mAh\\,cm^{-2}}$\n\nThe calculation for $CE$ is:\n\n$CE = \\frac{1.98\\,\\mathrm{mAh\\,cm^{-2}}}{2.0\\,\\mathrm{mAh\\,cm^{-2}}} = 0.99$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. To express $0.99$ with four significant figures, we add trailing zeros:\n\n$CE = 0.9900$\n\nThis a dimensionless quantity as the units of $\\mathrm{mAh\\,cm^{-2}}$ cancel out.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Cumulative Irreversible Lithium Loss**\n\nThe irreversible lithium loss in a single cycle, denoted as $Q_{\\mathrm{loss, cycle}}$, is the difference between the amount of lithium plated and the amount stripped. This represents the capacity corresponding to lithium that becomes electrochemically inactive during the cycle (e.g., due to side reactions or formation of isolated \"dead\" lithium).\n\n$Q_{\\mathrm{loss, cycle}} = Q_{\\mathrm{plate}} - Q_{\\mathrm{strip}}$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n$Q_{\\mathrm{loss, cycle}} = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{mAh\\,cm^{-2}} - 1.98\\,\\mathrm{mAh\\,cm^{-2}} = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{mAh\\,cm^{-2}}$\n\nAlternatively, the loss per cycle can be expressed in terms of the Coulombic Efficiency:\n\n$Q_{\\mathrm{loss, cycle}} = Q_{\\mathrm{plate}} \\times (1 - CE) = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{mAh\\,cm^{-2}} \\times (1 - 0.99) = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{mAh\\,cm^{-2}} \\times 0.01 = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{mAh\\,cm^{-2}}$\n\nThe problem states that the CE is constant for all cycles. This implies that the irreversible loss per cycle is also constant. The cumulative irreversible loss, $Q_{\\mathrm{loss, cumulative}}$, over $N$ cycles is the sum of the losses in each cycle.\n\n$Q_{\\mathrm{loss, cumulative}} = N \\times Q_{\\mathrm{loss, cycle}}$\n\nGiven the number of cycles is $N = 200$:\n\n$Q_{\\mathrm{loss, cumulative}} = 200 \\times 0.02\\,\\mathrm{mAh\\,cm^{-2}} = 4.0\\,\\mathrm{mAh\\,cm^{-2}}$\n\nThis result must also be reported to four significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $4$. To express this with the required precision, we write it as:\n\n$Q_{\\mathrm{loss, cumulative}} = 4.000\\,\\mathrm{mAh\\,cm^{-2}}$\n\nThe final answer is presented as a two-entry row matrix containing the dimensionless CE and the cumulative loss in $\\mathrm{mAh\\,cm^{-2}}$.",

It dominates at large $k$ (short wavelengths), penalizing sharp interfaces and stabilizing the system against microscopic fluctuations.\n\nThe newly introduced term is the hydrostatic pressure contribution, $-M\\,k^2\\,\\beta\\,p$. Since $M$, $k^2$, $\\beta$, and $p$ are all non-negative, this term is always negative or zero. It acts as an additional stabilizing force.\n\nCrucially, the pressure term modifies the chemical driving force. The condition for instability ($\\lambda(k) > 0$) becomes:\n$$\n-M\\,k^2 \\left[ (f_0''(\\phi_0) + \\beta\\,p) + \\kappa\\,k^2 \\right] > 0\n$$\nSince $-M\\,k^2 < 0$, instability requires the term in brackets to be negative:\n$$\n(f_0''(\\phi_0) + \\beta\\,p) + \\kappa\\,k^2 < 0\n$$\nThe term $f_0''(\\phi_0)$ is intrinsically negative in the unstable regime, promoting growth of protrusions (dendrites). The applied pressure $p$ contributes a positive term $\\beta\\,p$. If the pressure is sufficiently high such that $(f_0''(\\phi_0) + \\beta\\,p) \\ge 0$, then the entire bracketed expression $[(f_0''(\\phi_0) + \\beta\\,p) + \\kappa\\,k^2]$ will be positive for all $k > 0$. In this scenario, $\\lambda(k)$ will be negative for all $k > 0$, and the system becomes stable against perturbations of all wavelengths.\n\nTherefore, the externally applied hydrostatic pressure provides a mechanism to suppress the intrinsic thermodynamic instability of the phase-separating system, effectively stabilizing the planar interface and mitigating the growth of protrusions like lithium dendrites.\n\n**Step 5: Algorithmic Implementation**\n\nThe numerical routine will implement the derived dispersion relation:\n$$\n\\lambda(k) = -M\\,k^2 (f_0''(\\phi_0) + \\beta\\,p + \\kappa\\,k^2)\n$$\nThis formula directly computes the growth rate $\\lambda$ for a given set of parameters $\\{M, \\kappa, f_0''(\\phi_0), \\beta, p, k\\}$, which corresponds to the problem's requirement of evaluating $\\lambda(k)$ without simulating the full PDE. The program will iterate through the four specified test cases, calculate $\\lambda$ for each, and output the results in the specified format. The units provided in the problem statement are dimensionally consistent, as verified during the derivation, ensuring the final result for $\\lambda$ is in $\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.",
