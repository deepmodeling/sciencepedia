The final goal is to report the cardinality of this non-dominated set.\n\nThe optimization problem involves maximizing energy density, $\\rho_{E}$, and cycle life, $L$. Within the NSGA-II framework, which is formulated for minimization, this is correctly transformed by defining the objective functions as $f_{1}=-\\rho_{E}$ and $f_{2}=-L$. Minimizing $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$ is equivalent to maximizing $\\rho_{E}$ and $L$.\n\nThe core of the analysis rests on the concept of Pareto dominance for minimization.

The condition $f_{2}^{(1)} \\le f_{2}^{(5)}$ is $-1500 \\le -2100$, which is false.\n    - Comparing with $x^{(3)}$: $f^{(3)} = (-260, -1200)$. The condition $f_{2}^{(3)} \\le f_{2}^{(5)}$ is $-1200 \\le -2100$, which is false.\n    - Since no other solution $x^{(i)}$ satisfies both components of the dominance condition, $x^{(5)}$ is not dominated. Therefore, $x^{(5)}$ is a non-dominated solution.\n\nSummary of pairwise dominance relations:\n- $x^{(5)} \\prec x^{(1)}$\n- $x^{(5)} \\prec x^{(2)}$\n- $x^{(5)} \\prec x^{(4)}$\nNo other dominance relations exist among the pairs.\n\nThe non-dominated set, also known as the first Pareto front, consists of all solutions that are not dominated by any other solution. Based on the analysis above, the dominated solutions are $\\{x^{(1)}, x^{(2)}, x^{(4)}\\}$ and the non-dominated solutions are $\\{x^{(3)}, x^{(5)}\\}$.\n\nThe non-dominated set is $\\{x^{(3)}, x^{(5)}\\}$.\n\nThe cardinality of a set is the number of elements in the set.

In a maximization context, a solution $s_i$ weakly dominates a point $x$ if $s_{i,j} \\ge x_j$ for all objectives $j=1,2$. The reference point is given as $r$.
