Consider a quasi-electroneutral bulk region adjacent to an interface in a homogeneous isotropic solid electrolyte where mobile charge carriers are monovalent lithium ions. The screening of electrostatic potential perturbations into the solid is characterized by a length scale commonly referred to as the Debye length. Your task is to derive, from fundamental principles, the characteristic screening length for a solid with mobile point-charge carriers and then implement a program to compute it for a set of physically meaningful parameters.\n\nStarting only from fundamental laws and core definitions applicable to this context, derive the characteristic screening length for a small electrostatic perturbation in an ionic solid with mobile monovalent carriers. Use the following bases:\n- Gauss's law in matter and the definition of the electric displacement field: $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{D} = \\rho_{\\mathrm{free}}$ with $\\mathbf{D} = \\epsilon \\mathbf{E}$, where $\\epsilon$ is the absolute permittivity (in $\\mathrm{F}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$), and $\\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla \\phi$ is the electric field derived from the electrostatic potential $\\phi$.\n- The definition of charge density from mobile ionic species: $\\rho = \\sum_i z_i e n_i$, where $z_i$ is the valence (dimensionless), $e$ is the elementary charge (in $\\mathrm{C}$), and $n_i$ is the number density (in $\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$).\n- Thermal equilibrium and the Boltzmann distribution for the number density under a small perturbation of electrostatic potential: $n_i(\\phi) = n_{i,0} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{z_i e \\phi}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right)$, where $n_{i,0}$ is the unperturbed number density, $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant (in $\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$), and $T$ is the absolute temperature (in $\\mathrm{K}$).\nAssume a linear dielectric, small potential perturbations so linearization is valid, and that all mobile carriers are monovalent with $z_i = +1$. Show how the characteristic screening length emerges and how it depends on the mobile number density $c_i$ (in $\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$), the absolute permittivity $\\epsilon$ (in $\\mathrm{F}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$), and the temperature $T$ (in $\\mathrm{K}$).\n\nAfter the derivation, implement a program that, given $c_i$, $\\epsilon$, and $T$, computes the Debye screening length for LLZO and reports it in nanometers. For numerical constants, use the International System of Units (SI) values $e = 1.602176634\\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$, $k_{\\mathrm{B}} = 1.380649\\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$, and the vacuum permittivity $\\epsilon_0 = 8.854187817\\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$ if needed.\n\nExpress the final answers in nanometers, rounded to three decimal places.\n\nDesign a parameter study that demonstrates the effect of doping concentration and temperature on the Debye screening length by computing it for the following test suite. Each test case provides the mobile monovalent carrier number density $c_i$ (in $\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$), the absolute permittivity $\\epsilon$ (in $\\mathrm{F}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$), and the temperature $T$ (in $\\mathrm{K}$):\n- Test case 1 (typical LLZO at ambient conditions, happy path): $c_i = 1.0\\times 10^{24}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, $\\epsilon = 9.7396065987\\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{F}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$, $T = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n- Test case 2 (low doping limit, large screening length): $c_i = 1.0\\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, $\\epsilon = 9.7396065987\\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{F}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$, $T = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n- Test case 3 (high doping limit, short screening length): $c_i = 1.0\\times 10^{27}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, $\\epsilon = 9.7396065987\\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{F}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$, $T = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n- Test case 4 (elevated temperature and slightly higher permittivity): $c_i = 5.0\\times 10^{24}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, $\\epsilon = 1.15104441621\\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{F}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$, $T = 600\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n- Test case 5 (lower temperature and lower permittivity): $c_i = 5.0\\times 10^{24}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, $\\epsilon = 7.9687690313\\times 10^{-11}\\,\\mathrm{F}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$, $T = 200\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (for example, $[x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5]$), where each $x_j$ is the Debye screening length in nanometers for the corresponding test case, rounded to three decimal places.

The solution process will proceed.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe objective is to derive the characteristic screening length, known as the Debye length ($\\lambda_D$), for an ionic solid with mobile monovalent carriers. We begin with the fundamental electrostatic equations in a dielectric medium.\n\n1.  **Poisson's Equation in a Medium:**\n    We start with Gauss's law for the electric displacement field $\\mathbf{D}$:\n    $$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{D} = \\rho_{\\mathrm{free}} $$\n    where $\\rho_{\\mathrm{free}}$ is the density of free charges. For a linear, homogeneous, and isotropic dielectric medium, the displacement field is related to the electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ by $\\mathbf{D} = \\epsilon \\mathbf{E}$, where $\\epsilon$ is the absolute permittivity of the material. The electric field is the negative gradient of the electrostatic potential $\\phi$, i.e., $\\mathbf{E} = -\\nabla \\phi$.\n    Substituting these relations into Gauss's law gives:\n    $$ \\nabla \\cdot (\\epsilon (-\\nabla \\phi)) = \\rho_{\\mathrm{free}} $$\n    Since $\\epsilon$ is assumed to be a constant scalar (homogeneous medium), it can be pulled out of the divergence operator:\n    $$ -\\epsilon \\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla \\phi) = \\rho_{\\mathrm{free}} \\implies \\nabla^2 \\phi = -\\frac{\\rho_{\\mathrm{free}}}{\\epsilon} $$\n    This is the Poisson equation relating the potential to the charge density.\n\n2.  **Charge Density of Mobile Ions:**\n    The free charge density $\\rho_{\\mathrm{free}}$ arises from the deviation of the mobile ion concentration from its bulk equilibrium value. The solid electrolyte is overall charge neutral in the bulk. This neutrality is maintained by a balance between the positive mobile carriers (Li$^+$ ions) and a fixed negative background charge from the static lattice. Let the bulk equilibrium number density of the mobile carriers be $c_i$. The background charge density must be $\\rho_{\\mathrm{bg}} = -z_i e c_i$ to ensure neutrality.\n    The problem specifies monovalent carriers, so their charge is $z_i=+1$. The local number density of these carriers, $n(\\phi)$, is a function of the local potential $\\phi$. The total free charge density at a point is the sum of the mobile charge density and the fixed background charge density:\n    $$ \\rho_{\\mathrm{free}}(\\phi) = (+1) e n(\\phi) + \\rho_{\\mathrm{bg}} = e n(\\phi) - e c_i = e (n(\\phi) - c_i) $$\n\n3.  **Boltzmann Distribution and Linearization:**\n    At thermal equilibrium, the local number density $n(\\phi)$ is related to the bulk density $c_i$ (where $\\phi$ is taken to be zero) by the Boltzmann distribution:\n    $$ n(\\phi) = c_i \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(+1) e \\phi}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right) $$\n    Substituting this into the expression for $\\rho_{\\mathrm{free}}$:\n    $$ \\rho_{\\mathrm{free}}(\\phi) = e c_i \\left[ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{e \\phi}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right) - 1 \\right] $$\n    We now combine this with the Poisson equation to obtain the Poisson-Boltzmann equation:\n    $$ \\nabla^2 \\phi = -\\frac{e c_i}{\\epsilon} \\left[ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{e \\phi}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right) - 1 \\right] $$\n    The problem specifies that we should consider small potential perturbations, which means $|e\\phi| \\ll k_{\\mathrm{B}} T$. This allows for a Taylor series expansion of the exponential term, keeping only the first two terms: $\\exp(x) \\approx 1 + x$ for small $x$. Let $x = -e\\phi/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)$.\n    $$ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{e \\phi}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right) \\approx 1 - \\frac{e \\phi}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} $$\n    Substituting this linear approximation into the Poisson-Boltzmann equation:\n    $$ \\nabla^2 \\phi \\approx -\\frac{e c_i}{\\epsilon} \\left[ \\left(1 - \\frac{e \\phi}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right) - 1 \\right] = -\\frac{e c_i}{\\epsilon} \\left( -\\frac{e \\phi}{k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} \\right) $$\n    $$ \\nabla^2 \\phi = \\left(\\frac{e^2 c_i}{\\epsilon k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}\\right) \\phi $$\n\n4.  **Identifying the Debye Screening Length:**\n    This result is a form of the screened Poisson equation. It is typically written as:\n    $$ \\nabla^2 \\phi - \\kappa^2 \\phi = 0 $$\n    or\n    $$ \\nabla^2 \\phi - \\frac{1}{\\lambda_D^2} \\phi = 0 $$\n    where $\\lambda_D = 1/\\kappa$ is the characteristic screening length. For a one-dimensional system, this equation is $\\frac{d^2\\phi}{dx^2} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_D^2}\\phi$, which has solutions of the form $\\phi(x) = A e^{-x/\\lambda_D} + B e^{x/\\lambda_D}$. For a potential perturbation at an interface (e.g., at $x=0$) that decays into the bulk (for $x > 0$), the solution is $\\phi(x) = \\phi_0 e^{-x/\\lambda_D}$. The potential perturbation decays exponentially with a characteristic length $\\lambda_D$.\n\n    By comparing our derived equation with the standard form, we can identify the term representing $1/\\lambda_D^2$:\n    $$ \\frac{1}{\\lambda_D^2} = \\frac{e^2 c_i}{\\epsilon k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} $$\n    Solving for the Debye length, $\\lambda_D$, we get the final expression:\n    $$ \\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{e^2 c_i}} $$\n    This equation shows that the screening length increases with permittivity and temperature, and decreases with increasing mobile carrier concentration. This is the formula that will be implemented to solve the numerical part of the problem.\n\n### Computational Implementation\n\nThe derived formula will now be used to compute the Debye length for the given test cases. The calculation will be performed using SI units, and the final result will be converted to nanometers ($1\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$) and rounded to three decimal places.\n\n- $c_i$: in $\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n- $\\epsilon$: in $\\mathrm{F}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$\n- $T$: in $\\mathrm{K}$\n- $e$: $1.602176634\\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n- $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$: $1.380649\\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n\nThe calculation for each test case is a direct application of the formula $\\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\epsilon k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{e^2 c_i}}$.",

            "problem": "You are tasked with constructing a physically justified, algorithmic protocol to simulate current transients in a one-dimensional, planar, solid electrolyte system with a blocking solid-solid interface after an applied voltage step, and to predict the initial capacitive spike associated with space-charge charging. The system represents an idealized section of a battery cell where mobile ionic carriers in the solid electrolyte form a space-charge layer at a blocking electronic conductor interface. The program must be a complete, runnable implementation.\n\nBegin from a fundamental base using Ampère–Maxwell law, Gauss’s law, and Ohm’s law. The system is approximated by a lumped series combination of a bulk resistive path and an interfacial space-charge layer capacitance. The space-charge layer thickness is taken as the Debye length under the assumption of a monovalent ionic species with number density. Use the following foundations without introducing any target transient formula:\n- The Ampère–Maxwell law in one dimension states that the total current density is the sum of conduction and displacement contributions: $J_{\\mathrm{tot}} = \\sigma E + \\varepsilon \\,\\partial E/\\partial t$, where $\\sigma$ is the bulk electrical conductivity, $\\varepsilon$ is the permittivity, and $E$ is the electric field.\n- Gauss’s law for a parallel-plate configuration relates surface charge and field, implying a capacitance per area proportional to $\\varepsilon$ and inversely proportional to thickness. For a characteristic length equal to the Debye length $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{D}}$, the interfacial capacitance can be represented as $C = \\varepsilon A/\\lambda_{\\mathrm{D}}$ for area $A$.\n- Ohm’s law in one dimension for the bulk path of thickness $L$ yields $R = L/(\\sigma A)$.\n- The Debye length for a monovalent carrier concentration $c_0$ at temperature $T$ is defined by $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{D}} = \\sqrt{\\varepsilon k_{\\mathrm{B}} T / (e^2 c_0)}$, where $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant and $e$ is the elementary charge.\n\nUsing these foundations, derive a first-order state equation for the series resistor-capacitor representation driven by a time-dependent input voltage $V_{\\mathrm{in}}(t)$, then discretize and simulate the transient current $I(t)$ following the application of a voltage step with a finite, linear rise time $t_{\\mathrm{r}}$:\n- Use $V_{\\mathrm{in}}(t) = \\Delta V \\cdot \\min(t/t_{\\mathrm{r}},1)$, where $\\Delta V$ is the step amplitude. This definition removes the mathematical singularity of an ideal instantaneous step while preserving the physical behavior during charging.\n- Adopt a backward Euler time-discretization to ensure numerical stability for stiff conditions arising from large ratios of $\\varepsilon/\\sigma$.\n\nFrom the simulated transient, compute the total transferred charge $Q_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\int_0^{t_{\\mathrm{end}}} I(t)\\,dt$ in coulombs.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. The model is a standard and physically justified representation of an electrochemical interface, and the requested simulation protocol is algorithmically sound.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three main steps: 1) derivation of the governing electrodynamic model based on the provided physical principles; 2) formulation of a numerical algorithm to solve the model's equations; and 3) calculation of the specific physical quantities requested.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Lumped-Element Circuit Model**\nThe problem describes a physical system composed of a bulk solid electrolyte and a blocking interface. This system is justifiably approximated by a lumped-element circuit.\n\n-   **Bulk Resistance**: The bulk electrolyte path of thickness $L$, conductivity $\\sigma$, and cross-sectional area $A$ functions as a resistor. Its resistance, $R$, is determined by the geometric form of Ohm's law:\n    $$R = \\frac{L}{\\sigma A}$$\n\n-   **Interfacial Capacitance**: At the blocking interface, mobile ionic carriers accumulate, forming a space-charge layer. This layer stores electrical energy and thus acts as a capacitor. The problem specifies that the characteristic thickness of this capacitor is the Debye length, $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{D}}$. Using the formula for a parallel-plate capacitor, the interfacial capacitance $C$ is:\n    $$C = \\frac{\\varepsilon A}{\\lambda_{\\mathrm{D}}}$$\n    Here, $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{r}} \\varepsilon_0$ is the absolute permittivity of the electrolyte, with $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{r}}$ being the given relative permittivity and $\\varepsilon_0$ the permittivity of free space. The Debye length, $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{D}}$, is defined for a monovalent ionic species with number density $c_0$ at temperature $T$ as:\n    $$\\lambda_{\\mathrm{D}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\varepsilon k_{\\mathrm{B}} T}{e^2 c_0}}$$\n    where $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant and $e$ is the elementary charge.\n\nThe bulk region and the interfacial layer are physically in series. Therefore, the complete model is a series Resistor-Capacitor ($RC$) circuit.\n\n**2. State-Space Formulation and Numerical Solution**\nFor a series $RC$ circuit subjected to an external voltage $V_{\\mathrm{in}}(t)$, Kirchhoff's voltage law states that the applied voltage is the sum of the voltage drops across the resistor ($V_R$) and the capacitor ($V_C$):\n$$V_{\\mathrm{in}}(t) = V_R(t) + V_C(t)$$\nThe current $I(t)$ is common to both elements. From Ohm's law, $V_R(t) = I(t)R$. The fundamental capacitor relationship is $I(t) = C \\frac{dV_C(t)}{dt}$. Substituting these into the voltage balance equation yields the governing first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the capacitor voltage $V_C(t)$, which serves as the state variable:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{in}}(t) = R \\left( C \\frac{dV_C}{dt} \\right) + V_C(t)$$\nRearranging defines the state equation:\n$$RC \\frac{dV_C}{dt} + V_C(t) = V_{\\mathrm{in}}(t)$$\nThe system is assumed to be at rest initially, so the initial condition is $V_C(0) = 0$.\n\nTo solve this ODE numerically, we use the backward Euler method as specified. Let $\\Delta t$ be the time step and $V_{C,n}$ denote the capacitor voltage at time $t_n = n \\Delta t$. The derivative at the next time step, $t_{n+1}$, is approximated as $\\frac{dV_C}{dt} \\approx \\frac{V_{C,n+1} - V_{C,n}}{\\Delta t}$. Applying this to the state equation at $t_{n+1}$ gives:\n$$RC \\left( \\frac{V_{C,n+1} - V_{C,n}}{\\Delta t} \\right) + V_{C,n+1} = V_{\\mathrm{in}}(t_{n+1})$$\nSolving for the next state $V_{C,n+1}$ provides the iterative update rule. Defining the characteristic time constant $\\tau = RC$, the rule is:\n$$V_{C,n+1} = \\frac{\\tau V_{C,n} + \\Delta t \\cdot V_{\\mathrm{in}}(t_{n+1})}{\\tau + \\Delta t}$$\nThe input voltage $V_{\\mathrm{in}}(t)$ is a linear ramp of duration $t_{\\mathrm{r}}$ to an amplitude of $\\Delta V$:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{in}}(t) = \\Delta V \\cdot \\min(t/t_{\\mathrm{r}}, 1)$$\nOnce $V_{C,n+1}$ is computed, the current at that time step is found via Ohm's law for the resistor:\n$$I_{n+1} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{in}}(t_{n+1}) - V_{C,n+1}}{R}$$\n\n**3. Calculation of Outputs**\n\n-   **Initial Spike Amplitude ($I_{\\mathrm{spike}}$)**: This quantity is requested for the ideal limit of an instantaneous voltage step, where $t_{\\mathrm{r}} \\to 0^+$. In this limit, $V_{\\mathrm{in}}(t)$ becomes a Heaviside step function, jumping to $\\Delta V$ at $t=0^+$. Because the voltage across a capacitor cannot change instantaneously, the capacitor acts as a short circuit at the initial moment, i.e., $V_C(0^+) = V_C(0) = 0$. Consequently, the full applied voltage $\\Delta V$ appears across the resistor, and the initial current is:\n    $$I_{\\mathrm{spike}} = I(0^+) = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{in}}(0^+) - V_C(0^+)}{R} = \\frac{\\Delta V}{R}$$\n\n-   **Total Transferred Charge ($Q_{\\mathrm{total}}$)**: This is the time integral of the simulated current from $t=0$ to the end of the simulation, $t_{\\mathrm{end}}$:\n    $$Q_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\int_0^{t_{\\mathrm{end}}} I(t) dt$$\n    The integral is computed numerically by summing the charge transferred in each discrete time step: $Q_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\sum_{n=1}^{N} I_{n} \\Delta t$, where $N$ is the total number of steps. The simulation horizon, $t_{\\mathrm{end}} = \\max(10\\tau, 5t_{\\mathrm{r}})$, ensures that the system has reached a near-steady state where the capacitor is almost fully charged to $\\Delta V$. The total transferred charge should thus be very close to the final charge stored on the capacitor, $Q_C = C\\Delta V$.\n\nA two-regime time-stepping strategy is implemented for the simulation to ensure both accuracy and efficiency, given that the characteristic times $\\tau$ and $t_{\\mathrm{r}}$ can vary by orders of magnitude. The first regime, from $t=0$ to $t=t_{\\mathrm{r}}$, uses a small time step to resolve the voltage ramp. The second regime, from $t=t_{\\mathrm{r}}$ to $t_{\\mathrm{end}}$, uses a time step appropriate for the exponential decay governed by $\\tau$.",
