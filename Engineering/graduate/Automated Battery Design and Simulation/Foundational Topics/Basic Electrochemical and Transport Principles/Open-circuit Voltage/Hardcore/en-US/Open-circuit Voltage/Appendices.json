            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a general expression for the open-circuit voltage (OCV) of an electrochemical cell and its subsequent evaluation for two specific states: the standard state and a given nonstandard state. The analysis is based on fundamental principles of thermodynamics and electrochemistry.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the Gibbs free energy change, $\\Delta G$, and the maximum reversible electrical work, $w_{\\text{elec}}$, that can be performed by an electrochemical cell. For a spontaneous process, the decrease in Gibbs energy is equal to the maximum non-expansion work, so $\\Delta G = -w_{\\text{elec}}$. The electrical work is the product of the total charge transferred ($nF$) and the cell potential (OCV), denoted as $E_{\\text{cell}}$. Thus, $w_{\\text{elec}} = nFE_{\\text{cell}}$. This leads to the fundamental equation relating Gibbs energy and cell potential:\n$$\n\\Delta G = -nFE_{\\text{cell}}\n$$\nThis equation holds under any conditions, standard or nonstandard.\n\nNext, we introduce the thermodynamic relationship that connects the Gibbs free energy change under nonstandard conditions, $\\Delta G$, to the standard Gibbs free energy change, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$. This relationship is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta G = \\Delta G^{\\circ} + RT \\ln Q\n$$\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $Q$ is the reaction quotient.\n\nBy equating the two expressions for $\\Delta G$, we can derive the general expression for the OCV, $E_{\\text{cell}}$:\n$$\n-nFE_{\\text{cell}} = \\Delta G^{\\circ} + RT \\ln Q\n$$\nSolving for $E_{\\text{cell}}$ yields the desired general expression, which is a form of the Nernst equation:\n$$\nE_{\\text{cell}} = -\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\circ}}{nF} - \\frac{RT}{nF} \\ln Q\n$$\nThis expression provides the OCV as a function of the standard Gibbs energy change $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$, the gas constant $R$, the temperature $T$, the reaction quotient $Q$, the stoichiometric electron transfer number $n$, and the Faraday constant $F$. This completes the first part of the problem.\n\nNow, we evaluate the standard OCV, $E_{\\text{cell}}^{\\circ}$. The standard state is defined by the condition that $Q=1$, which means $\\ln Q = \\ln(1) = 0$.
