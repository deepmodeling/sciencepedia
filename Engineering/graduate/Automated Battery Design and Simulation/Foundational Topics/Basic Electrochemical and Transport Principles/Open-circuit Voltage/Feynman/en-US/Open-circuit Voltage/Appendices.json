            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a general expression for the open-circuit voltage (OCV) of an electrochemical cell and its subsequent evaluation for two specific states: the standard state and a given nonstandard state. The analysis is based on fundamental principles of thermodynamics and electrochemistry.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the Gibbs free energy change, $\\Delta G$, and the maximum reversible electrical work, $w_{\\text{elec}}$, that can be performed by an electrochemical cell. For a spontaneous process, the decrease in Gibbs energy is equal to the maximum non-expansion work, so $\\Delta G = -w_{\\text{elec}}$. The electrical work is the product of the total charge transferred and the cell potential (OCV), denoted as $E_{\\text{cell}}$. The total charge transferred is given by the product of the number of moles of electrons transferred in the balanced redox reaction, $n$, and the Faraday constant, $F$, which is the charge per mole of electrons. Thus, $w_{\\text{cell}} = nFE_{\\text{cell}}$. This leads to the fundamental equation relating Gibbs energy and cell potential:\n$$\n\\Delta G = -nFE_{\\text{cell}}\n$$\nThis equation holds under any conditions, standard or nonstandard.\n\nNext, we introduce the thermodynamic relationship that connects the Gibbs free energy change under nonstandard conditions, $\\Delta G$, to the standard Gibbs free energy change, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$. This relationship is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta G = \\Delta G^{\\circ} + RT \\ln Q\n$$\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $Q$ is the reaction quotient, which accounts for the activities (or concentrations/pressures) of the reactants and products at the nonstandard state.\n\nBy equating the two expressions for $\\Delta G$, we can derive the general expression for the OCV, $E_{\\text{cell}}$:\n$$\n-nFE_{\\text{cell}} = \\Delta G^{\\circ} + RT \\ln Q\n$$\nSolving for $E_{\\text{cell}}$ yields the desired general expression, which is a form of the Nernst equation:\n$$\nE_{\\text{cell}} = -\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\circ}}{nF} - \\frac{RT}{nF} \\ln Q\n$$\nThis expression provides the OCV as a function of the standard Gibbs energy change $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$, the gas constant $R$, the temperature $T$, the reaction quotient $Q$, the stoichiometric electron transfer number $n$, and the Faraday constant $F$. This completes the first part of the problem.\n\nNow, we evaluate the standard OCV, $E_{\\text{cell}}^{\\circ}$. The standard state is defined by the condition that all reactants and products have unit activity, which means the reaction quotient is $Q=1$. Consequently, $\\ln Q = \\ln(1) = 0$. Substituting this into the general expression for $E_{\\text{cell}}$ gives:\n$$\nE_{\\text{cell}}^{\\circ} = -\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\circ}}{nF} - \\frac{RT}{nF} \\ln(1) = -\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\circ}}{nF}\n$$\nWe are given the following values:\n$\\Delta G^{\\circ} = -20\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} = -20 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$\n$n = 1$\n$F = 96485.33212\\,\\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $E_{\\text{cell}}^{\\circ}$:\n$$\nE_{\\text{cell}}^{\\circ} = - \\frac{-20000\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}}{1 \\times 96485.33212\\,\\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}}} = \\frac{20000}{96485.33212}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,C^{-1}}\n$$\nSince $1\\,\\mathrm{Volt} = 1\\,\\mathrm{Joule\\,per\\,Coulomb}$ ($1\\,\\mathrm{V} = 1\\,\\mathrm{J\\,C^{-1}}$), the voltage is:\n$$\nE_{\\text{cell}}^{\\circ} \\approx 0.2072836\\,\\mathrm{V}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the standard OCV is $0.2073\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n\nFinally, we evaluate the OCV at the given nonstandard state, where $\\ln Q = 2$.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Average Open-Circuit Voltage**\n\nThe open-circuit voltage ($V_{\\text{OCV}}$) of an electrochemical cell is fundamentally related to the change in the Gibbs free energy, $\\Delta G_{\\text{rxn}}$, of the spontaneous cell reaction. The relationship is given by:\n$$V_{\\text{OCV}} = -\\frac{\\Delta G_{\\text{rxn}}}{nF}$$\nwhere $n$ is the number of moles of electrons transferred and $F$ is the Faraday constant. On a per-particle basis, this is equivalent to:\n$$V_{\\text{OCV}} = -\\frac{\\Delta E_{\\text{rxn}}}{ze}$$\nwhere $\\Delta E_{\\text{rxn}}$ is the energy change of the reaction, $z$ is the number of elementary charges $e$ transferred per formula unit of reaction.\n\nIn this problem, the cell consists of a lithium metal anode (Li/Li$^{+}$) and a $\\mathrm{Li}_{x}\\mathrm{Host}$ cathode. The reaction for the insertion of a finite amount of lithium, changing the composition from $x_1$ to $x_2$, is:\n$$(x_2 - x_1)\\,\\mathrm{Li}_{\\text{(metal)}} + \\mathrm{Li}_{x_1}\\mathrm{Host} \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{Li}_{x_2}\\mathrm{Host}$$\nThe change in energy for this reaction, $\\Delta E_{\\text{rxn}}$, at $T=0\\,\\mathrm{K}$ (where $G \\approx E$) is the energy of the products minus the energy of the reactants:\n$$\\Delta E_{\\text{rxn}} = E(\\mathrm{Li}_{x_2}\\mathrm{Host}) - \\left[ E(\\mathrm{Li}_{x_1}\\mathrm{Host}) + (x_2 - x_1)E(\\mathrm{Li}_{\\text{(metal)}}) \\right]$$\nHere, $E(\\mathrm{Li}_x\\mathrm{Host})$ is the DFT energy per formula unit of the cathode at composition $x$, and $E(\\mathrm{Li}_{\\text{(metal)}})$ is the energy per atom of lithium metal, which is its chemical potential, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}}^{\\text{metal}}$.\n$$\\Delta E_{\\text{rxn}} = E(x_2) - E(x_1) - (x_2 - x_1)\\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}}^{\\text{metal}}$$\nThe problem provides the grand potential, $\\Omega(x)$, defined with respect to a lithium reservoir. The general definition is $\\Omega(x) = E(x) - x\\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}}$, where $\\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}}$ is the chemical potential of the reservoir. Since the reference is lithium metal, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}}^{\\text{metal}}$.

Since each lithium atom transfers $z=1$ electron:\n$$Q = z e (x_2 - x_1)$$\nThe average voltage, $\\bar{V}_{[x_1, x_2]}$, over this interval is the total work done (negative of the energy change) divided by the total charge transferred:\n$$\\bar{V}_{[x_1, x_2]} = -\\frac{\\Delta E_{\\text{rxn}}}{Q} = -\\frac{\\Omega(x_2) - \\Omega(x_1)}{ze(x_2 - x_1)}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the average voltage.\n\n**Calculation of Average Voltages**\n\nGiven data:\n- $\\Omega(0) = -1000\\,\\mathrm{meV} = -1.000\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n- $\\Omega(0.5) = -1010\\,\\mathrm{meV} = -1.010\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n- $\\Omega(1) = -1020\\,\\mathrm{meV} = -1.020\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n- $z=1$\n\nThe problem states that an energy of $1\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ per electron corresponds to $1\\,\\mathrm{V}$.
