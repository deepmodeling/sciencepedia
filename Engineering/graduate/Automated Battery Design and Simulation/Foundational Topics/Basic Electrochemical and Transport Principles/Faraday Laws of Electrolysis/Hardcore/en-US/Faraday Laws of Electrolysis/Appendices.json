            "solution": "The solution requires implementing a numerical simulation and comparing its result to an exact analytical solution, based on the principles provided. The core steps are: 1) deriving an analytical expression for the exact charge $Q(T)$, 2) implementing the discrete numerical scheme to find the approximate charge $Q^N$, and 3) calculating the mass error using the electrochemical proportionality constant $\\nu$.\n\n**1. Analytical Solution for Exact Charge $Q(T)$**\n\nThe exact charge $Q(T)$ is the time integral of the current $I(t)$ from $0$ to $T$. Given the initial condition $Q(0)=0$:\n$$ Q(T) = \\int_0^T I(t) \\,dt = \\int_0^T \\left( I_0 + \\sum_{k=1}^{K} A_k \\sin(\\omega_k t + \\phi_k) \\right) dt $$\nBy integrating term-by-term:\n$$ Q(T) = \\int_0^T I_0 \\,dt + \\sum_{k=1}^{K} A_k \\int_0^T \\sin(\\omega_k t + \\phi_k) \\,dt $$\nThe integrals evaluate to:\n$$ Q(T) = I_0 T + \\sum_{k=1}^{K} A_k \\left[ -\\frac{\\cos(\\omega_k t + \\phi_k)}{\\omega_k} \\right]_0^T $$\n$$ Q(T) = I_0 T + \\sum_{k=1}^{K} \\frac{A_k}{\\omega_k} \\left( \\cos(\\phi_k) - \\cos(\\omega_k T + \\phi_k) \\right) $$\nThis formula gives the exact total charge passed. The exact mass is $m(T) = \\nu Q(T)$.\n\n**2. Numerical Solution for Discrete Charge $Q^N$**\n\nThe simulation uses an explicit (forward Euler) scheme to approximate the charge accumulation. The time interval $[0, T]$ is divided into $N=T/\\Delta t$ steps. The charge at step $n+1$ is updated from the charge at step $n$ as:\n$$ Q^{n+1} = Q^n + I(t_n) \\Delta t $$\nwhere $t_n = n \\Delta t$. Starting with $Q^0 = 0$, the total charge after $N$ steps is the sum of all charge increments, which forms a left Riemann sum:\n$$ Q^N = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} I(t_n) \\Delta t $$\nThe approximate mass is $m^N = \\nu Q^N$. The Python code implements this summation using vectorized `numpy` operations.\n\n**3. Mass Error Calculation**\n\nThe absolute mass error $E_m$ is the difference between the exact and approximate mass calculations:\n$$ E_m = |m(T) - m^N| = |\\nu Q(T) - \\nu Q^N| = \\nu |Q(T) - Q^N| $$\nThe electrochemical proportionality constant $\\nu$ is first calculated from the given material properties:\n$$ \\nu = \\frac{M \\eta}{z F} = \\frac{(6.94 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\text{kg/mol}) \\times 1.0}{(1) \\times (96485 \\, \\text{C/mol})} $$\nThe Python script calculates $Q(T)$ and $Q^N$ for each test case using the formulas above, computes their difference, and multiplies by $\\nu$ to find the mass error $E_m$.",
