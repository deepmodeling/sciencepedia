            "problem": "A lithium-ion cell in an automated design and simulation workflow is operated at steady discharge under isothermal conditions. The cell exhibits a measurable voltage drop relative to its equilibrium open-circuit voltage (OCV) due to three contributions: an ohmic drop across internal resistances, a concentration (mass transport) polarization at the cathode quantified by a known limiting current density, and a cathodic activation overpotential associated with charge-transfer kinetics. Assume a single-electron reaction ($n=1$) at the cathode and a symmetric kinetic barrier (symmetry factor equal to $0.5$). The measured quantities are: equilibrium open-circuit voltage $U_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 3.80~\\mathrm{V}$, operating cell voltage $U_{\\mathrm{cell}} = 3.62~\\mathrm{V}$ at current density $j = 4000~\\mathrm{A\\,m^{-2}}$, area-specific ohmic resistance $R_{\\mathrm{ohm}} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-5}~\\Omega\\,\\mathrm{m^2}$, and limiting current density $j_{\\mathrm{L}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{4}~\\mathrm{A\\,m^{-2}}$.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a self-contained set of parameters to calculate the cathodic activation overpotential based on fundamental electrochemical principles.\n\nThe core principle for solving this problem is the decomposition of the total voltage drop in an electrochemical cell. The operating voltage of the cell, $U_{\\mathrm{cell}}$, is lower than its equilibrium open-circuit voltage, $U_{\\mathrm{eq}}$, due to various irreversible losses, collectively known as overpotentials. For the system described, the total overpotential, $\\eta_{\\mathrm{total}}$, is the sum of three distinct contributions: the ohmic overpotential, $\\eta_{\\mathrm{ohm}}$; the concentration overpotential, $\\eta_{\\mathrm{conc}}$; and the activation overpotential, $\\eta_{\\mathrm{act}}$.\n\nThe relationship can be expressed as:\n$$ U_{\\mathrm{cell}} = U_{\\mathrm{eq}} - (\\eta_{\\mathrm{ohm}} + \\eta_{\\mathrm{conc}} + \\eta_{\\mathrm{act}}) $$\nThe total overpotential is the difference between the equilibrium and operating voltages:\n$$ \\eta_{\\mathrm{total}} = U_{\\mathrm{eq}} - U_{\\mathrm{cell}} $$\nOur goal is to find the cathodic activation overpotential, $\\eta_{\\mathrm{act}}$. We can rearrange the sum of overpotentials to isolate this term:\n$$ \\eta_{\\mathrm{act}} = \\eta_{\\mathrm{total}} - \\eta_{\\mathrm{ohm}} - \\eta_{\\mathrm{conc}} $$\n\nWe will now calculate each term on the right-hand side using the provided data.\n\n1.  **Total Overpotential ($\\eta_{\\mathrm{total}}$)**\n    Using the given equilibrium and operating voltages:\n    $U_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 3.80~\\mathrm{V}$\n    $U_{\\mathrm{cell}} = 3.62~\\mathrm{V}$\n    $$ \\eta_{\\mathrm{total}} = 3.80~\\mathrm{V} - 3.62~\\mathrm{V} = 0.18~\\mathrm{V} $$\n\n2.  **Ohmic Overpotential ($\\eta_{\\mathrm{ohm}}$)**\n    The ohmic overpotential is the voltage drop due to the internal resistance of the cell, described by Ohm's law. The problem provides the area-specific ohmic resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{ohm}}$, and the operating current density, $j$.\n    $j = 4000~\\mathrm{A\\,m^{-2}}$\n    $R_{\\mathrm{ohm}} = 1.5 \\times 10^{-5}~\\Omega\\,\\mathrm{m^2}$\n    $$ \\eta_{\\mathrm{ohm}} = j \\times R_{\\mathrm{ohm}} = (4000~\\mathrm{A\\,m^{-2}}) \\times (1.5 \\times 10^{-5}~\\Omega\\,\\mathrm{m^2}) = 0.06~\\mathrm{V} $$\n\n3.  **Concentration Overpotential ($\\eta_{\\mathrm{conc}}$)**\n    The concentration overpotential arises from the difference in the concentration of the electroactive species at the electrode surface compared to the bulk. This is a Nernstian-type potential shift. For a cathodic (reduction) process, it is given by:\n    $$ \\eta_{\\mathrm{conc}} = \\frac{RT}{nF} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{bulk}}}{C_{\\mathrm{surface}}}\\right) $$\n    where $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $n$ is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction, and $F$ is the Faraday constant. $C_{\\mathrm{bulk}}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{surface}}$ are the bulk and surface concentrations of the reactant, respectively. The problem specifies a single-electron reaction, so $n=1$.\n\n    The ratio of concentrations can be related to the operating current density, $j$, and the limiting current density, $j_{\\mathrm{L}}$. The limiting current density corresponds to the condition where the surface concentration of the reactant drops to zero. Based on a simple diffusion model:\n    $$ \\frac{j}{j_{\\mathrm{L}}} = 1 - \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{surface}}}{C_{\\mathrm{bulk}}} $$\n    Rearranging this gives the required concentration ratio:\n    $$ \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{bulk}}}{C_{\\mathrm{surface}}} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{j}{j_{\\mathrm{L}}}} = \\frac{j_{\\mathrm{L}}}{j_{\\mathrm{L}} - j} $$\n    Substituting this into the expression for $\\eta_{\\mathrm{conc}}$:\n    $$ \\eta_{\\mathrm{conc}} = \\frac{RT}{nF} \\ln\\left(\\frac{j_{\\mathrm{L}}}{j_{\\mathrm{L}} - j}\\right) $$\n    Now, we substitute the given values:\n    $T = 298.15~\\mathrm{K}$\n    $R = 8.314462618~\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n    $F = 96485~\\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}}$\n    $n = 1$\n    $j = 4000~\\mathrm{A\\,m^{-2}}$\n    $j_{\\mathrm{L}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{4}~\\mathrm{A\\,m^{-2}}$\n    $$ \\eta_{\\mathrm{conc}} = \\frac{(8.314462618~\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (298.15~\\mathrm{K})}{1 \\times (96485~\\mathrm{C\\,mol^{-1}})} \\ln\\left(\\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{4}~\\mathrm{A\\,m^{-2}}}{5.0 \\times 10^{4}~\\mathrm{A\\,m^{-2}} - 4000~\\mathrm{A\\,m^{-2}}}\\right) $$\n    $$ \\eta_{\\mathrm{conc}} \\approx (0.0256926~\\mathrm{V}) \\times \\ln\\left(\\frac{50000}{46000}\\right) \\approx (0.0256926~\\mathrm{V}) \\times \\ln(1.0869565...) $$\n    $$ \\eta_{\\mathrm{conc}} \\approx (0.0256926~\\mathrm{V}) \\times (0.0833816) \\approx 0.0021422~\\mathrm{V} $$\n\n4.  **Activation Overpotential ($\\eta_{\\mathrm{act}}$)**\n    Finally, we can calculate the activation overpotential by subtracting the ohmic and concentration overpotentials from the total overpotential.\n    $$ \\eta_{\\mathrm{act}} = \\eta_{\\mathrm{total}} - \\eta_{\\mathrm{ohm}} - \\eta_{\\mathrm{conc}} $$\n    $$ \\eta_{\\mathrm{act}} \\approx 0.18~\\mathrm{V} - 0.06~\\mathrm{V} - 0.0021422~\\mathrm{V} $$\n    $$ \\eta_{\\mathrm{act}} \\approx 0.12~\\mathrm{V} - 0.0021422~\\mathrm{V} \\approx 0.1178578~\\mathrm{V} $$\n\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\eta_{\\mathrm{act}} \\approx 0.1179~\\mathrm{V} $$\nThe information about the symmetry factor being $0.5$ is consistent with a symmetric energy barrier for the charge transfer reaction but is not required for this calculation, which relies on the macroscopic decomposition of voltage losses rather than a direct application of the Butler-Volmer equation.",

            "solution": "The problem has been validated and is determined to be a valid, well-posed scientific problem. It is scientifically grounded in established electrochemical principles, is self-contained with all necessary data and definitions, and is expressed objectively. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or unsound premises.\n\nThe objective is to deconstruct a measured total overpotential, $\\eta_{\\mathrm{meas}}$, into its three primary components: activation overpotential ($\\eta_{\\mathrm{act}}$), concentration overpotential ($\\eta_{\\mathrm{conc}}$), and ohmic overpotential ($\\eta_{\\Omega}$). This is achieved by applying fundamental electrochemical equations. The problem assumes these contributions are additive, such that $\\eta_{\\mathrm{meas}} = \\eta_{\\mathrm{act}} + \\eta_{\\mathrm{conc}} + \\eta_{\\Omega}$. After separating the components, the exchange current density, $j_0$, is inferred.

This change in concentration alters the equilibrium potential as described by the Nernst relation. The problem provides a linear mass-transfer relation, $c_{s} = c_{b} (1 - \\frac{j}{j_{L}})$, where $c_s$ is the surface concentration, $c_b$ is the bulk concentration, and $j_L$ is the limiting current density.

With $\\eta_{\\Omega}$ and $\\eta_{\\mathrm{conc}}$ determined, $\\eta_{\\mathrm{act}}$ is found by subtracting these from the total measured overpotential, based on the additivity assumption:\n$$ \\eta_{\\mathrm{act}} = \\eta_{\\mathrm{meas}} - \\eta_{\\Omega} - \\eta_{\\mathrm{conc}} $$\n\nStep $4$: Inference of Exchange Current Density ($j_0$)\nThe exchange current density, $j_0$, is a measure of the intrinsic reactivity of the electrode process at equilibrium. It is inferred by solving the Butler–Volmer equation for $j_0$. The problem specifies a symmetric charge transfer process where the anodic and cathodic transfer coefficients are equal ($\\alpha_a = \\alpha_c = \\alpha$). The symmetric Butler–Volmer equation relates the net current density $j$ to the activation overpotential $\\eta_{\\mathrm{act}}$:\n$$ j = j_{0} \\left[ \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha n F \\eta_{\\mathrm{act}}}{RT}\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha n F \\eta_{\\mathrm{act}}}{RT}\\right) \\right] $$\nThis can be expressed using the hyperbolic sine function:\n$$ j = 2 j_{0} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{\\alpha n F \\eta_{\\mathrm{act}}}{RT}\\right) $$\nSolving for $j_0$ yields:\n$$ j_{0} = \\frac{j}{2 \\sinh\\left(\\frac{\\alpha n F \\eta_{\\mathrm{act}}}{RT}\\right)} $$\nThis equation allows for the calculation of $j_0$ once $\\eta_{\\mathrm{act}}$ is known.\n\nThe program will implement these four steps for each set of input parameters provided in the test suite.

Your identification must recover these parameters from the synthetic DC polarization and EIS data that your program generates from first principles.\n\nCase A (typical regime):\n- Temperature: $T=298\\,\\mathrm{K}$, electrons: $n=1$, DC bias: $j_{\\mathrm{dc}}=200\\,\\mathrm{A}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$, diffusion time: $\\tau_D=0.5\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n- Ground-truth parameters: $j_0=10\\,\\mathrm{A}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$, $\\alpha=0.5$, $R_s=1.0\\times 10^{-4}\\,\\Omega\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}$, $C_{\\mathrm{dl}}=0.5\\,\\mathrm{F}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$, $j_L=1500\\,\\mathrm{A}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$.\n- DC currents: $\\{50,100,200,400\\}\\,\\mathrm{A}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$.\n- EIS frequencies: $\\{0.2,1,5,10,50,200\\}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\nCase B (low exchange current, higher resistance):\n- Temperature: $T=298\\,\\mathrm{K}$, electrons: $n=1$, DC bias: $j_{\\mathrm{dc}}=200\\,\\mathrm{A}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$, diffusion time: $\\tau_D=2.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n- Ground-truth parameters: $j_0=0.5\\,\\mathrm{A}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$, $\\alpha=0.35$, $R_s=3.0\\times 10^{-4}\\,\\Omega\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}$, $C_{\\mathrm{dl}}=1.2\\,\\mathrm{F}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$, $j_L=800\\,\\mathrm{A}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$.\n- DC currents: $\\{20,50,100,200,300\\}\\,\\mathrm{A}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$.\n- EIS frequencies: $\\{0.1,0.5,2,10,30,100\\}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\nCase C (near limiting current):\n- Temperature: $T=298\\,\\mathrm{K}$, electrons: $n=1$, DC bias: $j_{\\mathrm{dc}}=200\\,\\mathrm{A}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$, diffusion time: $\\tau_D=1.0\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n- Ground-truth parameters: $j_0=50\\,\\mathrm{A}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$, $\\alpha=0.6$, $R_s=8.0\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\Omega\\,\\mathrm{m}^{2}$, $C_{\\mathrm{dl}}=0.3\\,\\mathrm{F}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$, $j_L=500\\,\\mathrm{A}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$.\n- DC currents: $\\{50,100,200,300,450\\}\\,\\mathrm{A}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$.\n- EIS frequencies: $\\{0.1,0.3,1,3,10,30\\}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\nFor each case, synthesize the DC polarization overpotentials and EIS impedances by correctly combining activation, concentration, and ohmic effects for DC, and by correctly forming the linearized small-signal impedance around $j_{\\mathrm{dc}}$, consistent with the finite diffusion boundary layer and double-layer storage. Then, identify the parameters $\\{j_0,\\alpha,R_s,C_{\\mathrm{dl}},j_L\\}$.\n\nFinal output format:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. Represent each test case’s identified parameter vector as a five-element list ordered as $[j_0,\\alpha,R_s,C_{\\mathrm{dl}},j_L]$, in SI units. Aggregate the three lists into one list, with no spaces anywhere, for example: $[[x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5],[y_1,y_2,y_3,y_4,y_5],[z_1,z_2,z_3,z_4,z_5]]$. All parameter values must be printed as decimal floating-point numbers in their SI units, and angles, if any, would be in radians; however, no angle appears in this task. Percentages, if any, must be expressed as decimals; however, no percentages appear in this task.",
            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in established electrochemical principles, well-posed, and provides a complete and consistent set of information for solving a non-trivial parameter identification task. The workflow will proceed by first deriving the necessary mathematical models from the provided physical assumptions, then implementing these models to generate synthetic data, and finally using a numerical optimization routine to recover the model parameters from this synthetic data.\n\n### Theoretical Formulation\n\nThe total measured overpotential, $\\eta_{\\text{total}}$, at a given current density $j$ is the sum of three contributions: ohmic overpotential ($\\eta_{\\text{ohmic}}$), activation overpotential ($\\eta_{\\text{act}}$), and concentration overpotential ($\\eta_{\\text{conc}}$).\n\n$$\n\\eta_{\\text{total}}(j) = \\eta_{\\text{ohmic}}(j) + \\eta_{\\text{act}}(j) + \\eta_{\\text{conc}}(j)\n$$\n\nThe impedance $Z(\\omega)$ is modeled using an equivalent circuit that reflects the underlying physical processes at a specific DC bias current $j_{\\text{dc}}$.\n\n#### 1. DC Polarization Model ($j$-$\\eta$ relationship)\n\n**Ohmic Overpotential ($\\eta_{\\text{ohmic}}$)**\nThis contribution arises from the resistance of the electrolyte and other components, modeled as a single area-specific resistance $R_s$ in units of $\\Omega\\,\\mathrm{m}^2$. According to Ohm's law:\n$$\n\\eta_{\\text{ohmic}}(j) = j \\cdot R_s\n$$\n\n**Activation Overpotential ($\\eta_{\\text{act}}$)**\nThe relationship between the current density $j$ and the activation overpotential $\\eta_{\\text{act}}$ is described by the Butler-Volmer equation, which is derived from the principles of transition state theory applied to electron transfer.\n$$\nj = j_0 \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha n F}{R T} \\eta_{\\text{act}}\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(1-\\alpha) n F}{R T} \\eta_{\\text{act}}\\right) \\right)\n$$\nHere, $j_0$ is the exchange current density, $\\alpha$ is the charge transfer coefficient, $n$ is the number of electrons transferred (given as $n=1$), $F$ is the Faraday constant ($96485\\,\\mathrm{C}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$), $R$ is the universal gas constant ($8.314\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$), and $T$ is the absolute temperature. To find $\\eta_{\\text{act}}$ for a given $j$, this transcendental equation must be solved numerically.\n\n**Concentration Overpotential ($\\eta_{\\text{conc}}$)**\nThis overpotential results from mass transport limitations. For a steady-state current $j$, the reactant concentration at the electrode surface, $C_s$, is depleted relative to the bulk concentration, $C_b$. The relationship is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{C_s}{C_b} = 1 - \\frac{j}{j_L}\n$$\nwhere $j_L$ is the mass-transport-limited current density. The resulting potential difference, as given by the Nernst equation, is:\n$$\n\\eta_{\\text{conc}}(j) = \\frac{R T}{n F} \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_b}{C_s}\\right) = -\\frac{R T}{n F} \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{j}{j_L}\\right)\n$$\nThis term becomes significant as $j$ approaches $j_L$.\n\n#### 2. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) Model\n\nThe impedance is measured as a small-signal response around a DC operating point $j_{\\mathrm{dc}}$. The total impedance $Z(\\omega)$ at an angular frequency $\\omega = 2\\pi f$ is modeled by a standard equivalent circuit:\n$$\nZ(\\omega) = R_s + Z_{\\text{interface}}(\\omega)\n$$\nThe term $Z_{\\text{interface}}(\\omega)$ represents the impedance of the electrode-electrolyte interface. It consists of the double-layer capacitance $C_{\\text{dl}}$ in parallel with the Faradaic impedance $Z_F(\\omega)$:\n$$\nZ_{\\text{interface}}(\\omega) = \\left( \\frac{1}{Z_F(\\omega)} + j\\omega C_{\\text{dl}} \\right)^{-1}\n$$\nwhere $j = \\sqrt{-1}$. The Faradaic impedance accounts for the charge transfer reaction and mass transport:\n$$\nZ_F(\\omega) = R_{\\text{ct}} + Z_W(\\omega)\n$$\n\n**Charge Transfer Resistance ($R_{\\text{ct}}$)**\nThis is the differential resistance of the activation process, obtained by linearizing the Butler-Volmer equation around the DC operating point ($j_{\\mathrm{dc}}$, $\\eta_{\\text{act,dc}}$):\n$$\nR_{\\text{ct}} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial j}{\\partial \\eta_{\\text{act}}} \\right)^{-1}_{\\eta_{\\text{act,dc}}} = \\left[ j_0 \\left( \\frac{\\alpha n F}{R T} e^{\\frac{\\alpha n F \\eta_{\\text{act,dc}}}{R T}} + \\frac{(1-\\alpha) n F}{R T} e^{-\\frac{(1-\\alpha) n F \\eta_{\\text{act,dc}}}{R T}} \\right) \\right]^{-1}\n$$\nwhere $\\eta_{\\text{act,dc}}$ is the activation overpotential corresponding to $j_{\\mathrm{dc}}$.\n\n**Finite-Length Warburg Diffusion Impedance ($Z_W$)**\nThis element models one-dimensional diffusion in a layer of finite thickness, consistent with the characteristic diffusion time $\\tau_D$. Its impedance is given by:\n$$\nZ_W(\\omega) = R_D \\frac{\\tanh\\left(\\sqrt{j\\omega\\tau_D}\\right)}{\\sqrt{j\\omega\\tau_D}}\n$$\nwhere $R_D$ is the limiting diffusion resistance, derived by differentiating the steady-state concentration overpotential with respect to current at the DC bias point $j_{\\mathrm{dc}}$:\n$$\nR_D = \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\eta_{\\text{conc}}}{\\partial j} \\right)_{j_{\\mathrm{dc}}} = \\frac{R T}{n F} \\frac{1}{j_L - j_{\\mathrm{dc}}}\n$$\n\n### Parameter Identification Algorithm\n\nThe five unknown parameters, forming the vector $\\mathbf{p} = [j_0, \\alpha, R_s, C_{\\text{dl}}, j_L]$, are determined by minimizing the sum of squared errors between the model predictions and the synthetic measurement data. The synthetic data consists of DC overpotentials $\\{\\eta_k^{\\text{meas}}\\}$ and complex EIS impedances $\\{Z_k^{\\text{meas}}\\}$.\n\nA composite residual vector, $\\mathbf{r}(\\mathbf{p})$, is constructed. To balance the contributions from DC (potential) and EIS (impedance) data, which have different units and magnitudes, a normalized (relative) error metric is used.\n$$\n\\mathbf{r}(\\mathbf{p}) = \\left[ \\dots, \\frac{\\eta_k^{\\text{meas}} - \\eta^{\\text{model}}_k(\\mathbf{p})}{\\eta_k^{\\text{meas}}}, \\dots, \\frac{\\Re(Z_k^{\\text{meas}}) - \\Re(Z_k^{\\text{model}}(\\mathbf{p}))}{|Z_k^{\\text{meas}}|}, \\dots, \\frac{\\Im(Z_k^{\\text{meas}}) - \\Im(Z_k^{\\text{model}}(\\mathbf{p}))}{|Z_k^{\\text{meas}}|}, \\dots \\right]^T\n$$\nThe optimization problem is to find $\\mathbf{p}$ that minimizes the squared norm of this vector, $\\|\\mathbf{r}(\\mathbf{p})\\|^2$.\n\nThis non-linear least-squares problem is solved using the `scipy.optimize.least_squares` function, which is well-suited for such tasks. The optimization is constrained by physically meaningful bounds:\n- $j_0 > 0$\n- $0 < \\alpha < 1$\n- $R_s > 0$\n- $C_{\\text{dl}} > 0$\n- $j_L > \\max(\\{j_k\\}, j_{\\text{dc}})$\n\n### Implementation Summary\n\nThe solution is implemented in Python. A core function, `get_model_outputs`, takes a set of parameters $\\mathbf{p}$ and the experimental conditions, and computes the corresponding DC overpotentials and EIS spectra based on the derived theoretical models. This involves numerical root-finding with `scipy.optimize.fsolve` to invert the Butler-Volmer equation. An objective function, `objective_function`, calculates the residual vector $\\mathbf{r}(\\mathbf{p})$ for a given parameter set. The main `solve` procedure iterates through each test case. For each case, it first generates the synthetic \"measurement\" data using the ground-truth parameters. Then, it calls `scipy.optimize.least_squares` with the objective function, an initial parameter guess, and the specified bounds to find the optimal parameter values. The identified parameters for each case are then collected and formatted for the final output.",
