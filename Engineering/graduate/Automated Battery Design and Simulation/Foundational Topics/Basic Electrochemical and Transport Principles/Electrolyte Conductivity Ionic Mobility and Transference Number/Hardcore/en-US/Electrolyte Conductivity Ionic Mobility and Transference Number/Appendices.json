The problem specifies a Bruggeman-type morphology factor with an exponent of $3/2$ applied to transport. This is interpreted as a direct scaling of the bulk conductivity by the porosity raised to this power.\n    $$\\kappa_{\\text{B}} = \\kappa_{\\text{bulk}} \\cdot \\varepsilon^{3/2}$$\n    This model is a common heuristic for estimating the effective properties of random isotropic media.\n\n2.  **Direct Simulation Surrogate Model ($\\kappa_{\\text{sim}}$):**\n    This model is based on a first-principles homogenization that accounts for the tortuous path ions must travel through the porous structure. It begins by calculating the effective diffusivity of each species, $D_{i,\\text{eff}}$, which is reduced from the bulk value $D_i$ by the geometric constraints of the porous medium, characterized by porosity $\\varepsilon$ and tortuosity $\\tau$.\n    $$D_{i,\\text{eff}} = D_i \\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\tau}$$\n    The effective conductivity, $\\kappa_{\\text{sim}}$, is then assembled using these effective diffusivities. This is equivalent to applying the geometric correction factor $\\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\tau}$ to the transport term (mobility) for each species in the fundamental conductivity equation:\n    $$\\kappa_{\\text{sim}} = \\frac{F^2}{RT} (z_+^2 D_{+,\\text{eff}} c_+ + z_-^2 D_{-,\\text{eff}} c_-)$$\n    Substituting the expression for $D_{i,\\text{eff}}$:\n    $$\\kappa_{\\text{sim}} = \\frac{F^2}{RT} \\left( z_+^2 \\left(D_+ \\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\tau}\\right) c_+ + z_-^2 \\left(D_- \\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\tau}\\right) c_- \\right) = \\left( \\frac{F^2}{RT} (z_+^2 D_+ c_+ + z_-^2 D_- c_-) \\right) \\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\tau}$$\n    This simplifies to:\n    $$\\kappa_{\\text{sim}} = \\kappa_{\\text{bulk}} \\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\tau}$$\n\nOnce both effective conductivities, $\\kappa_{\\text{B}}$ and $\\kappa_{\\text{sim}}$, are computed, their relative difference is calculated as:\n$$\\text{Relative Difference} = \\frac{\\kappa_{\\text{B}} - \\kappa_{\\text{sim}}}{\\kappa_{\\text{sim}}}$$\n\nThe final quantity to calculate is the cation transference number, $t_+$. It is defined as the fraction of the total ionic current carried by the cations. In terms of mobilities:\n$$t_+ = \\frac{|z_+| u_+ c_+}{|z_+| u_+ c_+ + |z_-| u_- c_-}$$\nSince $u_i$ is directly proportional to $D_i$ at a constant temperature $T$, we can express $t_+$ using diffusion coefficients, which is computationally more direct:\n$$t_+ = \\frac{|z_+| D_+ c_+}{|z_+| D_+ c_+ + |z_-| D_- c_-}$$\nFor all test cases provided, the electrolyte is a symmetric $1:1$ system where $|z_+|=|z_-|=1$ and $c_+=c_-$, satisfying electroneutrality. This simplifies the expression to $t_+ = D_+ / (D_+ + D_-)$. However, the general form will be used for correctness.\n\nAn important part of the analysis is to determine if $t_+$ is invariant under the two morphology-integration strategies.\nFor the simulation-based model, the effective transference number $t_{+,\\text{sim}}$ is based on effective diffusivities $D_{i,\\text{eff}}$:\n$$t_{+, \\text{sim}} = \\frac{|z_+| D_{+,\\text{eff}} c_+}{|z_+| D_{+,\\text{eff}} c_+ + |z_-| D_{-,\\text{eff}} c_-} = \\frac{|z_+| (D_+ \\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\tau}) c_+}{|z_+| (D_+ \\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\tau}) c_+ + |z_-| (D_- \\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\tau}) c_-}$$\nThe common geometric factor $\\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\tau}$ cancels from the numerator and denominator, proving that $t_{+,\\text{sim}} = t_+$.\nA similar analysis applies to the Bruggeman model. If we interpret the scaling as being applied to the transport term for each species (i.e., $D_{i,\\text{B}} = D_i \\varepsilon^{3/2}$), the scaling factor $\\varepsilon^{3/2}$ also cancels, showing that $t_{+,\\text{B}} = t_+$. Therefore, the transference number is theoretically invariant for both models because they apply a uniform scalar correction to the transport properties of all ionic species. The boolean check for invariance will compare the transference numbers calculated using bulk and effective properties to confirm this within a numerical tolerance of $10^{-12}$.\nThe computed values for $\\kappa_{\\text{B}}$, $\\kappa_{\\text{sim}}$, their relative difference, and $t_+$ will be rounded to six decimal places as required.",
