            "problem": "A binary liquid electrolyte fills a one-dimensional slab separator of thickness $L$ between two ideally blocking, nonreactive, planar electrodes.

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the steady-state molar flux of a neutral salt pair in a binary liquid electrolyte under specific conditions. To solve this, we begin with the general Nernst-Planck equation, which describes the flux of an ionic species $i$ in an electrolyte. The total flux $\\vec{J}_i$ is the sum of contributions from diffusion, migration (due to an electric field), and convection (due to bulk fluid motion).\n\nThe Nernst-Planck equation for an ionic species $i$ is:\n$$ \\vec{J}_i = -D_i \\nabla c_i - \\frac{z_i F}{RT} D_i c_i \\nabla \\phi + c_i \\vec{v} $$\nwhere $D_i$ is the diffusivity of species $i$, $c_i$ is its molar concentration, $z_i$ is its charge number, $F$ is the Faraday constant, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $\\phi$ is the electrostatic potential, and $\\vec{v}$ is the mass-averaged fluid velocity. The problem specifies a one-dimensional system along the $x$-axis, from $x=0$ to $x=L$.\n\nWe apply the conditions stated in the problem:\n1.  **No convection**: The mass-averaged fluid velocity is zero, so $\\vec{v} = 0$. The convective term $c_i \\vec{v}$ vanishes.\n2.  **Isothermal system**: The temperature $T$ is constant.\n3.  **Ideal electrolyte**: Activity coefficients are unity, so concentration can be used directly.\n4.  **One-dimensional slab**: The gradient operator $\\nabla$ becomes the derivative $\\frac{d}{dx}$.\n\nThe Nernst-Planck equations for the cation (subscript $+$) and anion (subscript $-$) simplify to:\n$$ J_+(x) = -D_+ \\frac{dc_+(x)}{dx} - \\frac{z_+ F}{RT} D_+ c_+(x) \\frac{d\\phi(x)}{dx} $$\n$$ J_-(x) = -D_- \\frac{dc_-(x)}{dx} - \\frac{z_- F}{RT} D_- c_-(x) \\frac{d\\phi(x)}{dx} $$\n\nThe electrolyte is a binary salt, which we assume to be of the form $A_{\\nu_+} B_{\\nu_-}$. For simplicity and without loss of generality for the given conditions, let's consider a symmetric $1:1$ salt (e.g., LiCl), so $z_+ = 1$ and $z_- = -1$. The principle of electroneutrality in the electrolyte bulk requires that the local concentrations of positive and negative charges balance. Therefore, $z_+ c_+ + z_- c_- = 0$, which for a $1:1$ salt implies $c_+ = c_-$. We denote this common concentration as the salt concentration, $c(x)$. Consequently, their concentration gradients are also equal: $\\frac{dc_+}{dx} = \\frac{dc_-}{dx} = \\frac{dc}{dx}$.\n\nThe problem states there is no externally applied current. The total electric current density, $i$, is related to the ionic fluxes by $i = F \\sum_i z_i J_i$. For our binary system, this is:\n$$ i = F(z_+ J_+ + z_- J_-) = F(J_+ - J_-) = 0 $$\nThis implies that the molar fluxes of the cation and anion must be equal at every point in the slab: $J_+(x) = J_-(x)$.\n\nThe problem also states that the cation and anion have identical diffusivities, so $D_+ = D_-$. We denote this common ionic diffusivity by $D_{ion}$. Under these symmetric conditions, let's examine the fluxes:\n$$ J_+ = -D_{ion} \\frac{dc}{dx} - \\frac{z_+ F}{RT} D_{ion} c \\frac{d\\phi}{dx} $$\n$$ J_- = -D_{ion} \\frac{dc}{dx} - \\frac{z_- F}{RT} D_{ion} c \\frac{d\\phi}{dx} $$\nSetting $J_+ = J_-$ and substituting $z_+ = -z_-$, we obtain:\n$$ -D_{ion} \\frac{dc}{dx} - \\frac{z_+ F}{RT} D_{ion} c \\frac{d\\phi}{dx} = -D_{ion} \\frac{dc}{dx} + \\frac{z_+ F}{RT} D_{ion} c \\frac{d\\phi}{dx} $$\n$$ -2 \\frac{z_+ F}{RT} D_{ion} c \\frac{d\\phi}{dx} = 0 $$\nSince $z_+$, $F$, $R$, $T$, $D_{ion}$, and $c$ are all non-zero, this equation requires that the electric field must be zero everywhere within the slab:\n$$ \\frac{d\\phi}{dx} = 0 $$\nThis confirms the problem's statement that the diffusion potential vanishes under these symmetry conditions. With a zero electric field, the migration term in the Nernst-Planck equation disappears. The flux is purely diffusive.\n\nThe flux of each ion is now given by:\n$$ J_+ = J_- = -D_{ion} \\frac{dc}{dx} $$\nThe flux of the neutral salt pair, $J$, is equal to the flux of the individual ions, $J = J_+ = J_-$. The problem provides the \"ambipolar salt diffusivity\", $D$. In the specific case where ionic diffusivities are equal ($D_+ = D_- = D_{ion}$), the ambipolar diffusivity is simply the ionic diffusivity, so $D = D_{ion}$. Thus, the governing equation for the salt flux is:\n$$ J = -D \\frac{dc}{dx} $$\n\nThe system is at steady state, which means that all time derivatives are zero ($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 0$). The foundational statement of species conservation (the continuity equation) is $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\vec{J} = 0$. In one dimension and at steady state, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{dJ}{dx} = 0 $$\nThis implies that the molar flux $J$ is constant throughout the slab, from $x=0$ to $x=L$.\n\nSince both $J$ and $D$ are constants, we can integrate the flux equation with respect to position across the slab:\n$$ \\int_{c(0)}^{c(L)} dc = \\int_{0}^{L} -\\frac{J}{D} dx $$\nUsing the given boundary conditions, $c(0) = c_0$ and $c(L) = c_L$:\n$$ c(L) - c(0) = -\\frac{J}{D} (L - 0) $$\n$$ c_L - c_0 = -\\frac{J L}{D} $$\nWe can now solve for the steady-state molar flux, $J$:\n$$ J = -D \\frac{c_L - c_0}{L} = D \\frac{c_0 - c_L}{L} $$\nThis expression is Fick's first law of diffusion for a steady-state process.\n\nNow we substitute the provided numerical values:\n-   Slab thickness: $L = 1.00 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n-   Ambipolar salt diffusivity: $D = 1.80 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}\\ s^{-1}}$.\n-   Left boundary concentration: $c_{0} = 1.20 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-3}}$.\n-   Right boundary concentration: $c_{L} = 9.00 \\times 10^{2}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-3}}$.\n\nThe concentration difference is:\n$$ c_0 - c_L = (1.20 \\times 10^{3}) - (9.00 \\times 10^{2}) = 1200 - 900 = 300\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-3}} $$\nThis can be written as $3.00 \\times 10^2 \\ \\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-3}}$.\n\nSubstituting the values into the expression for the flux $J$:\n$$ J = (1.80 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}\\ s^{-1}}) \\times \\frac{3.00 \\times 10^{2}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-3}}}{1.00 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}} $$\nFirst, we calculate the term $\\frac{c_0 - c_L}{L}$:\n$$ \\frac{3.00 \\times 10^{2}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-3}}}{1.00 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}} = 3.00 \\times 10^{(2 - (-4))}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-4}} = 3.00 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-4}} $$\nNow, we multiply by the diffusivity $D$:\n$$ J = (1.80 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{m^{2}\\ s^{-1}}) \\times (3.00 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-4}}) $$\n$$ J = (1.80 \\times 3.00) \\times 10^{(-10 + 6)}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-2}\\ s^{-1}} $$\n$$ J = 5.40 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ m^{-2}\\ s^{-1}} $$\nThe problem requires rounding the answer to three significant figures.

The concept of a thin boundary layer and a neutral bulk is no longer applicable. Consequently, the full PNP model, which solves the coupled Nernst-Planck and Poisson equations, is necessary. For Case $2$: $L = 10\\,\\text{nm}$, $c_0 = 10\\,\\text{mM} = 10 \\text{ mol/m}^3$, we calculate $\\lambda_D \\approx 1.45 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{m} = 1.45\\,\\text{nm}$. This gives $\\delta = \\lambda_D / L = 1.45\\,\\text{nm} / 10\\,\\text{nm} = 0.145$, which is not orders of magnitude smaller than $1$ and can be considered to be approaching the $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ regime, where double layer overlap is significant.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Even if $\\delta \\ll 1$, when $i$ approaches or exceeds $i_{\\lim}$, an extended space-charge region forms whose thickness can become $\\mathcal{O}(L)$; therefore solving Gauss’s law in a Poisson–Nernst–Planck model is required in that regime.**\nThis statement describes a well-known failure of the electroneutral model. The limiting current regime is characterized by the depletion of ions at an electrode surface. For example, if cations are consumed at a cathode at $x=L$, their concentration $c_+(L)$ approaches zero. For an EN model to hold, one would also need $c_-(L) \\to 0$. This salt depletion creates a zone of very high electrical resistance. To drive current through this zone, a large electric field is required. According to Poisson's equation, a large field gradient implies a significant space charge. A more rigorous analysis shows that as $i \\to i_{\\lim}$, a space charge layer develops that is much wider than the equilibrium Debye length $\\lambda_D$. Its thickness can become a significant fraction of the system size $L$. This happens because the local Debye length, which scales as $1/\\sqrt{\\sum_i z_i^2 c_i}$, becomes very large in the ion-depleted zone. Therefore, even if the bulk parameter $\\delta$ is small, the EN assumption breaks down locally, but over a macroscopic region. A PNP model is required to capture this phenomenon.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. In highly concentrated electrolytes with large ionic strength, the smallness of $\\lambda_D$ guarantees exact electroneutrality in the bulk under all conditions, including near and beyond the diffusion-limited current; therefore a Poisson–Nernst–Planck model is never necessary.**\nThis statement makes an absolute claim that is demonstrably false. While higher concentration leads to a smaller $\\lambda_D$ and smaller $\\delta$, which strengthens the EN approximation under low-current conditions (as per statement A), it does not hold \"under all conditions\". Statement C provides a direct counterexample: the limiting current regime. The formation of an extended space-charge layer near $i_{\\lim}$ occurs regardless of how small the bulk $\\delta$ is. The claim that a PNP model is \"never necessary\" is far too strong. Furthermore, the dilute-solution theory itself, including the Nernst-Planck equation, becomes inaccurate at very high concentrations, but within the context of the model presented, this statement is flawed due to the limiting current issue.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E. At high Péclet number $\\mathrm{Pe} \\gg 1$, convection dominates and obviates the need to solve Gauss’s law for $\\Phi$ even when $\\delta = \\mathcal{O}(1)$; thus an electroneutral model remains accurate regardless of $\\delta$ at sufficiently large $\\mathrm{Pe}$.**\nThis statement incorrectly assesses the role of convection. The Péclet number, $\\mathrm{Pe}=UL/D$, compares the rates of convective and diffusive transport. High $\\mathrm{Pe}$ means convection is the dominant mechanism for species transport over diffusion. However, the need to solve Gauss's law is dictated by the parameter $\\delta$, which compares the electrostatic screening length $\\lambda_D$ to the system length $L$. If $\\delta=\\mathcal{O}(1)$, significant space charge exists throughout the domain. Convection, represented by the term $c_i\\mathbf{v}$, transports all species, and thus transports the net charge $\\rho_e = F \\sum_i z_i c_i$ with the fluid velocity $\\mathbf{v}$. It does not screen or neutralize this charge. The fundamental electrostatic problem remains. Therefore, strong convection does not justify the electroneutrality assumption when it is already invalid due to $\\delta = \\mathcal{O}(1)$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.",
