            "solution": "The problem statement is analyzed and found to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of solid-state physics, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. The provided physical parameters are plausible for the specified material class, and the simplifying assumptions (rigid-band, constant DOS, zero-temperature) are explicitly stated and justified. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into three parts, which will be addressed in sequence.\n\n**1. Hole Concentration $p(x)$**\n\nThe hole concentration $p(x)$ is the number of holes per unit volume. This can be determined by first calculating the number of formula units (f.u.) per unit volume, $N_{\\mathrm{f.u.}}$, and then multiplying by the number of holes per formula unit.\n\nThe number of formula units per unit volume is derived from the material's bulk density $\\rho$, molar mass $M$, and Avogadro's number $N_{A}$. The volume of one mole of the substance is $V_{\\mathrm{mol}} = M/\\rho$. Since one mole contains $N_{A}$ formula units, the concentration of formula units is:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{f.u.}} = \\frac{N_{A}}{V_{\\mathrm{mol}}} = \\frac{N_{A} \\rho}{M}\n$$\nThe problem states that for every lithium ion $\\mathrm{Li}^{+}$removed, one electron is removed from the relevant band, creating one hole. At full lithiation, the material is $\\text{Li}_{1.00}\\text{(...)}\\text{O}_{2}$. For a general lithium content $x$, the number of removed lithium ions per formula unit, relative to the fully lithiated state, is $(1-x)$. Therefore, the number of holes per formula unit, $n_{h}(x)$, is:\n$$\nn_{h}(x) = 1-x\n$$\nThe hole concentration per unit volume, $p(x)$, is the product of the number of holes per formula unit and the number of formula units per unit volume:\n$$\np(x) = n_{h}(x) \\cdot N_{\\mathrm{f.u.}} = (1-x) \\frac{N_{A} \\rho}{M}\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the hole concentration $p(x)$.\n\nNow, we evaluate this for the specific compositions $x_{1} = 0.92$ and $x_{2} = 0.78$. First, we calculate the constant factor $N_{\\mathrm{f.u.}}$:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{f.u.}} = \\frac{(6.022 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}) (4.80\\,\\mathrm{g\\,cm}^{-3})}{96.93\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol}^{-1}} \\approx 2.9803 \\times 10^{22}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\n$$\nFor $x_{1} = 0.92$:\n$$\np(x_{1}) = (1 - 0.92) \\times (2.9803 \\times 10^{22}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}) = 0.08 \\times (2.9803 \\times 10^{22}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}) \\approx 2.384 \\times 10^{21}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\n$$\nFor $x_{2} = 0.78$:\n$$\np(x_{2}) = (1 - 0.78) \\times (2.9803 \\times 10^{22}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}) = 0.22 \\times (2.9803 \\times 10^{22}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}) \\approx 6.557 \\times 10^{21}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\n$$\n\n**2. Fermi Level $E_{F}(x)$**\n\nThe position of the Fermi level $E_{F}(x)$ is determined using the rigid-band and constant density of states (DOS) assumptions at zero temperature. Let the energy $E$ be measured from the bottom of the band, which spans from $E=0$ to $E=W$. The DOS per formula unit is given as a constant, $g(E) = g_{0}$.\n\nAt $x=1.00$, the band is fully occupied, meaning the Fermi level is at the top of the band, $E_{F}(1.00) = W$. When lithium is removed (i.e., $x < 1.00$), holes are created at the top of the band. In the zero-temperature approximation, the states between the new Fermi level $E_{F}(x)$ and the top of the band $W$ are empty (i.e., occupied by holes). The total number of holes per formula unit, $n_{h}(x)$, is given by integrating the DOS over this energy range:\n$$\nn_{h}(x) = \\int_{E_{F}(x)}^{W} g(E) \\, dE\n$$\nUsing $g(E) = g_{0}$ and $n_{h}(x) = 1-x$, we have:\n$$\n1-x = \\int_{E_{F}(x)}^{W} g_{0} \\, dE = g_{0} [E]_{E_{F}(x)}^{W} = g_{0} (W - E_{F}(x))\n$$\nSolving for $E_{F}(x)$:\n$$\nW - E_{F}(x) = \\frac{1-x}{g_{0}} \\implies E_{F}(x) = W - \\frac{1-x}{g_{0}}\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the Fermi level relative to the band bottom.\n\nWe can now compute the required values using $W=1.50\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and $g_{0} = 1.20\\,\\mathrm{states\\,eV^{-1}\\,f.u.^{-1}}$.\nFor $x_{1} = 0.92$:\n$$\nE_{F}(x_{1}) = 1.50\\,\\mathrm{eV} - \\frac{1 - 0.92}{1.20\\,\\mathrm{eV}^{-1}} = 1.50\\,\\mathrm{eV} - \\frac{0.08}{1.20}\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 1.50\\,\\mathrm{eV} - 0.0666... \\,\\mathrm{eV} \\approx 1.433\\,\\mathrm{eV}\n$$\nFor $x_{2} = 0.78$:\n$$\nE_{F}(x_{2}) = 1.50\\,\\mathrm{eV} - \\frac{1 - 0.78}{1.20\\,\\mathrm{eV}^{-1}} = 1.50\\,\\mathrm{eV} - \\frac{0.22}{1.20}\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 1.50\\,\\mathrm{eV} - 0.1833... \\,\\mathrm{eV} \\approx 1.317\\,\\mathrm{eV}\n$$\nThe change in the Fermi level is:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{F} = E_{F}(x_{2}) - E_{F}(x_{1}) = \\left(W - \\frac{1-x_{2}}{g_{0}}\\right) - \\left(W - \\frac{1-x_{1}}{g_{0}}\\right) = \\frac{1-x_{1}}{g_{0}} - \\frac{1-x_{2}}{g_{0}} = \\frac{x_{2}-x_{1}}{g_{0}}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta E_{F} = \\frac{0.78 - 0.92}{1.20\\,\\mathrm{eV}^{-1}} = \\frac{-0.14}{1.20}\\,\\mathrm{eV} = -0.1166... \\,\\mathrm{eV} \\approx -0.117\\,\\mathrm{eV}\n$$\n\n**3. Ratio of Electronic Conductivities $\\sigma(x_{2})/\\sigma(x_{1})$**\n\nThe electronic conductivity $\\sigma$ is given by the Drude model expression $\\sigma = e \\mu p$, where $e$ is the elementary charge, $\\mu$ is the hole mobility, and $p$ is the hole concentration. The problem states that the mobility $\\mu$ can be considered composition-independent. The elementary charge $e$ is a fundamental constant.\n\nWe wish to find the ratio $\\sigma(x_{2})/\\sigma(x_{1})$. Using the Drude model:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sigma(x_{2})}{\\sigma(x_{1})} = \\frac{e \\mu p(x_{2})}{e \\mu p(x_{1})}\n$$\nSince $e$ and $\\mu$ are constants, they cancel out, leaving:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sigma(x_{2})}{\\sigma(x_{1})} = \\frac{p(x_{2})}{p(x_{1})}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $p(x)$ derived in the first part, $p(x) = (1-x) \\frac{N_{A} \\rho}{M}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sigma(x_{2})}{\\sigma(x_{1})} = \\frac{(1-x_{2}) \\frac{N_{A} \\rho}{M}}{(1-x_{1}) \\frac{N_{A} \\rho}{M}}\n$$\nThe constant factor $\\frac{N_{A} \\rho}{M}$ also cancels, yielding a simple relationship dependent only on the lithium contents $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sigma(x_{2})}{\\sigma(x_{1})} = \\frac{1-x_{2}}{1-x_{1}}\n$$\nWe can now substitute the given values $x_{1} = 0.92$ and $x_{2} = 0.78$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sigma(x_{2})}{\\sigma(x_{1})} = \\frac{1 - 0.78}{1 - 0.92} = \\frac{0.22}{0.08} = \\frac{22}{8} = \\frac{11}{4} = 2.75\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Thus, $2.75$ is written as $2.750$.",

The anti-site pair formation energies are $E_{f}^{\\mathrm{LFP}} = 1.250\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and $E_{f}^{\\mathrm{NCA}} = 0.350\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, obtained as the difference in total energies between the anti-site and bulk supercells under charge neutrality and conserved stoichiometry. The larger value in $\\text{LiFePO}_4$ arises because the olivine polyanion framework $\\text{PO}_4^{3-}$ is stiffer and the lithium diffusion channels are one-dimensional; placing $\\mathrm{Fe^{2+}}$ on the lithium site severely distorts corner-sharing $\\text{FeO}_6$/$\\text{LiO}_6$ polyhedra and constricts the percolation pathway, incurring higher elastic and electrostatic penalties. In layered oxides, both lithium and transition metals occupy similar octahedra and the $\\mathrm{Ni/Li}$ swap preserves comparable metal–oxygen bond lengths and layer topology, yielding a smaller energetic penalty.\n\nB. The formation energies in both materials can be made equal by tuning the chemical potentials $\\mu_{\\mathrm{Fe}}$ and $\\mu_{\\mathrm{Ni}}$ such that $\\mu_{\\mathrm{Fe}} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}}$ and $\\mu_{\\mathrm{Ni}} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}}$, because for anti-site defects the dominant term is the reservoir chemical potential rather than the crystal total energy difference; therefore, the observed differences are not intrinsic to structure.\n\nC. The Fe/Li anti-site in $\\text{LiFePO}_4$ is lower in energy than the Ni/Li anti-site in the layered oxide because $\\mathrm{Fe^{2+}}$ and $\\mathrm{Li^+}$ have nearly equal Shannon radii in octahedral coordination ($0.78\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$ versus $0.76\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$), whereas $\\mathrm{Ni^{2+}}$ ($0.69\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$) is significantly smaller than $\\mathrm{Li^+}$, leading to larger mismatch and higher energy in the layered oxide.\n\nD. The difference in computed formation energies is an artifact of supercell size: the layered oxide supercell contains fewer atoms and therefore exhibits lower numerical noise, which reduces the apparent anti-site formation energy; with identical atom counts, the Fe/Li and Ni/Li anti-site formation energies would be comparable irrespective of structure.",

A solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe primary task is to compute the formation energy, $E_f$, of the neutral anti-site pair in both LFP and NCA and to provide a physical explanation for the difference.\n\nThe formation energy of a defect in a crystal is generally given by:\n$$E_f[X^q] = E_{\\mathrm{tot}}[X^q] - E_{\\mathrm{tot}}[\\text{bulk}] - \\sum_i \\Delta n_i \\mu_i + q E_F$$\nwhere $E_{\\mathrm{tot}}[X^q]$ is the total energy of the supercell containing the defect $X$ with charge $q$, $E_{\\mathrm{tot}}[\\text{bulk}]$ is the total energy of the equivalent pristine supercell, $\\Delta n_i$ is the number of atoms of species $i$ added to or removed from the supercell, $\\mu_i$ are the corresponding atomic chemical potentials, and $E_F$ is the Fermi level.\n\nThe problem specifies a very particular type of defect: a neutral anti-site pair created by swapping two atoms within the supercell. For this case, the formula simplifies significantly:\n1.  The defect is neutral, so the charge $q=0$, and the term $q E_F$ is zero.\n2.  The defect is created by swapping one atom of type A with one atom of type B. This means the total number of atoms of each species in the supercell is conserved ($\\Delta n_i = 0$ for all $i$). Thus, the chemical potential term $\\sum_i \\Delta n_i \\mu_i$ is also zero.\n\nTherefore, for a neutral, stoichiometric anti-site pair, the formation energy is simply the difference between the total energy of the supercell containing the defect and that of the pristine bulk supercell:\n$$E_f = E_{\\text{anti-site supercell}} - E_{\\text{bulk supercell}}$$\n\nUsing the provided DFT total energies:\n\nFor $\\mathrm{LiFePO_4}$ (LFP):\n$$E_{f}^{\\mathrm{LFP}} = E_{\\mathrm{anti}}^{\\mathrm{LFP}} - E_{\\mathrm{bulk}}^{\\mathrm{LFP}} = (-4561.878\\,\\mathrm{eV}) - (-4563.128\\,\\mathrm{eV}) = 1.250\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\n\nFor $\\mathrm{LiNi_{0.8}Co_{0.15}Al_{0.05}O_2}$ (NCA):\n$$E_{f}^{\\mathrm{NCA}} = E_{\\mathrm{anti}}^{\\mathrm{NCA}} - E_{\\mathrm{bulk}}^{\\mathrm{NCA}} = (-7891.102\\,\\mathrm{eV}) - (-7891.452\\,\\mathrm{eV}) = 0.350\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\n\nThe calculations show that the formation energy of the Fe/Li anti-site pair in LFP ($1.250\\,\\mathrm{eV}$) is substantially higher than that of the Ni/Li anti-site pair in NCA ($0.350\\,\\mathrm{eV}$). This indicates that cation mixing is energetically much more difficult in LFP than in the layered oxide.\n\nThe physical explanation for this large difference lies in the distinct crystal structures:\n- **LFP:** The olivine structure is built upon a rigid, three-dimensional framework of corner- and edge-sharing $\\mathrm{FeO_6}$ octahedra and $\\mathrm{PO_4}$ tetrahedra. The strong, covalent P-O bonds make the phosphate polyanion $\\mathrm{PO_4}^{3-}$ a very stiff unit. Lithium ions reside in distinct, one-dimensional channels. Swapping a $\\mathrm{Li^+}$ ion with an $\\mathrm{Fe^{2+}}$ ion disrupts this ordered structure significantly. The Fe ion is forced into a site topologically and energetically unsuited for it, causing large local strain. This is confirmed by the problem's data showing large oxygen displacements ($\\sim 0.08\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$) and a significant constriction of the Li diffusion channel. This large structural deformation against a stiff lattice results in a high elastic energy penalty, leading to a high defect formation energy.\n- **NCA:** This layered oxide adopts a structure where both Li and transition metals (TM) occupy octahedral sites within a close-packed oxygen sublattice. The structure consists of alternating planes of $\\mathrm{LiO_6}$ octahedra and $\\mathrm{TMO_6}$ octahedra. Although the layers are distinct, the fundamental coordination environment (octahedral) is the same. Swapping a $\\mathrm{Ni^{2+}}$ ion into the Li layer, while energetically unfavorable, is less disruptive. The local environment is more accommodating, as confirmed by the smaller oxygen displacements ($\\sim 0.03\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$). The oxide lattice is generally more flexible than the phosphate polyanion framework. This results in a much smaller strain penalty and a lower defect formation energy.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A. The anti-site pair formation energies are $E_{f}^{\\mathrm{LFP}} = 1.250\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and $E_{f}^{\\mathrm{NCA}} = 0.350\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, obtained as the difference in total energies between the anti-site and bulk supercells under charge neutrality and conserved stoichiometry. The larger value in $\\text{LiFePO}_4$ arises because the olivine polyanion framework $\\text{PO}_4^{3-}$ is stiffer and the lithium diffusion channels are one-dimensional; placing $\\mathrm{Fe^{2+}}$ on the lithium site severely distorts corner-sharing $\\text{FeO}_6$/$\\text{LiO}_6$ polyhedra and constricts the percolation pathway, incurring higher elastic and electrostatic penalties. In layered oxides, both lithium and transition metals occupy similar octahedra and the $\\mathrm{Ni/Li}$ swap preserves comparable metal–oxygen bond lengths and layer topology, yielding a smaller energetic penalty.**\n- The calculated formation energies, $1.250\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and $0.350\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, are correct.\n- The method described for the calculation is correct for this specific defect type.\n- The physical explanation provided is accurate and detailed. It correctly attributes the high energy in LFP to the stiffness of the $\\text{PO}_4^{3-}$ framework and the distinctiveness of the cation sites, leading to high strain. It also correctly describes the layered oxide structure as more accommodating to cation mixing due to the similar octahedral coordination for both Li and TM sites. This explanation aligns perfectly with the provided structural data and known principles of crystal chemistry.\n- Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. The formation energies in both materials can be made equal by tuning the chemical potentials $\\mu_{\\mathrm{Fe}}$ and $\\mu_{\\mathrm{Ni}}$ such that $\\mu_{\\mathrm{Fe}} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}}$ and $\\mu_{\\mathrm{Ni}} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}}$, because for anti-site defects the dominant term is the reservoir chemical potential rather than the crystal total energy difference; therefore, the observed differences are not intrinsic to structure.**\n- This statement fundamentally misunderstands the calculation of formation energy for a stoichiometric defect. As derived above, chemical potentials do not enter the calculation for an internal atom swap. The energy difference is an intrinsic property.\n- The claim that the energy difference is not intrinsic to the structure is false. The structural and chemical differences between LFP and NCA are precisely the reason for the different formation energies.\n- The conditions $\\mu_{\\mathrm{Fe}} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}}$ and $\\mu_{\\mathrm{Ni}} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}}$ are arbitrary and generally unphysical.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The Fe/Li anti-site in $\\text{LiFePO}_4$ is lower in energy than the Ni/Li anti-site in the layered oxide because $\\mathrm{Fe^{2+}}$ and $\\mathrm{Li^+}$ have nearly equal Shannon radii in octahedral coordination ($0.78\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$ versus $0.76\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$), whereas $\\mathrm{Ni^{2+}}$ ($0.69\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$) is significantly smaller than $\\mathrm{Li^+}$, leading to larger mismatch and higher energy in the layered oxide.**\n- The primary claim that the Fe/Li anti-site is lower in energy ($E_{f}^{\\mathrm{LFP}} < E_{f}^{\\mathrm{NCA}}$) is factually incorrect based on the provided data and our calculation ($1.250\\,\\mathrm{eV} > 0.350\\,\\mathrm{eV}$).\n- While the ionic radii values cited are correct and the size mismatch argument is a valid, albeit simplistic, line of reasoning, it leads to a conclusion that is directly contradicted by the more accurate DFT results. This demonstrates the limitations of using only ionic radii to predict defect energetics, as it ignores lattice stiffness and bonding characteristics.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The difference in computed formation energies is an artifact of supercell size: the layered oxide supercell contains fewer atoms and therefore exhibits lower numerical noise, which reduces the apparent anti-site formation energy; with identical atom counts, the Fe/Li and Ni/Li anti-site formation energies would be comparable irrespective of structure.**\n- This option incorrectly dismisses a real physical effect as a computational artifact. The large difference in formation energies ($0.900\\,\\mathrm{eV}$) is primarily due to the profound differences in crystal structure, not finite-size effects from the supercells, which are of reasonable size ($112$ and $108$ atoms).\n- The argument that a smaller supercell has \"lower numerical noise\" and thus a lower formation energy is baseless. Finite-size errors do not scale in this simplistic manner.\n- The assertion that the energies would be comparable \"irrespective of structure\" is fundamentally wrong. Defect formation energy is an intrinsic property that is highly sensitive to the host material's structure and chemistry.\n- Verdict: **Incorrect**.",
