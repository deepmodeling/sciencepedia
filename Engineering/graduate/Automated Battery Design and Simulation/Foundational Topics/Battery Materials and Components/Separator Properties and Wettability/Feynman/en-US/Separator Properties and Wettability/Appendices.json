            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It describes a classic physical scenario of capillary-driven flow in a porous medium, modeled by the Lucas-Washburn equation. The provided parameters are physically realistic for battery components, and sufficient information is given to derive a unique, meaningful solution. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe solution is derived by balancing the driving capillary pressure with the resisting viscous pressure drop within a single cylindrical pore.\n\nThe fundamental assumptions for this model are:\n1.  The porous separator is idealized as a bundle of parallel, non-interconnected, straight cylindrical capillaries of uniform radius $r$.\n2.  The flow of the electrolyte is laminar and incompressible, allowing the use of the Hagen-Poiseuille equation. The fluid is assumed to be Newtonian, with a constant dynamic viscosity $\\mu$.\n3.  The imbibition process is quasi-steady, meaning that at any instant, the pressure drop relationship is assumed to be the same as for a steady flow over the already filled length $x$. This neglects inertial effects (the acceleration of the fluid).\n4.  The driving pressure is solely due to capillarity and is constant throughout the process. It is described by the Young-Laplace equation using a static contact angle $\\theta$. This implies the contact angle is independent of the speed of the advancing liquid front.\n5.  Gravitational forces are negligible, which is a valid assumption for horizontally oriented capillaries or for sufficiently small pore sizes where capillary forces dominate.\n6.  The gas ahead of the liquid front is at a constant pressure, and the pressure at the liquid inlet (at $x=0$) is also constant. The difference between these two pressures is assumed to be zero.\n\nLet $x(t)$ be the distance the liquid front has advanced into the capillary at time $t$. The velocity of the front is $v(t) = \\frac{dx}{dt}$.\n\nStep 1: Capillary Driving Pressure ($\\Delta P_{cap}$)\nThe pressure difference across the curved liquid-vapor interface (meniscus) in a cylindrical tube is given by the Young-Laplace equation:\n$$ \\Delta P_{cap} = \\frac{2\\gamma_{LV}\\cos\\theta}{r} $$\nwhere $\\gamma_{LV}$ is the liquid-vapor surface tension, $\\theta$ is the contact angle between the liquid and the capillary wall, and $r$ is the pore radius. For imbibition to occur, the pressure behind the meniscus must be lower than the pressure ahead, which requires $\\cos\\theta  0$, or $\\theta  90^\\circ$. This pressure difference is the driving force for the flow.\n\nStep 2: Viscous Resisting Pressure ($\\Delta P_{visc}$)\nThe pressure drop required to drive a laminar flow through a cylindrical tube of length $x$ is given by the Hagen-Poiseuille equation:\n$$ \\Delta P_{visc} = \\frac{8\\mu Qx}{\\pi r^4} $$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity and $Q$ is the volumetric flow rate.\n\nThe volumetric flow rate $Q$ is related to the velocity of the liquid front, $v$, by the cross-sectional area of the pore, $A = \\pi r^2$:\n$$ Q = A v = (\\pi r^2) \\frac{dx}{dt} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $Q$ into the Hagen-Poiseuille equation gives the instantaneous viscous pressure drop as a function of the filled length $x$ and the front velocity $\\frac{dx}{dt}$:\n$$ \\Delta P_{visc} = \\frac{8\\mu (\\pi r^2 \\frac{dx}{dt}) x}{\\pi r^4} = \\frac{8\\mu x}{r^2} \\frac{dx}{dt} $$\n\nStep 3: Formulation and Solution of the Governing Equation\nBy balancing the driving capillary pressure with the resisting viscous pressure, $\\Delta P_{cap} = \\Delta P_{visc}$, we obtain the governing differential equation for the motion of the liquid front:\n$$ \\frac{2\\gamma_{LV}\\cos\\theta}{r} = \\frac{8\\mu x}{r^2} \\frac{dx}{dt} $$\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation. We can solve it by separating variables. Rearranging the terms to isolate $\\frac{dx}{dt}$:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{2\\gamma_{LV}\\cos\\theta}{r} \\cdot \\frac{r^2}{8\\mu x} = \\frac{r\\gamma_{LV}\\cos\\theta}{4\\mu x} $$\nNow, separate variables by moving terms involving $x$ to the left side and terms involving $t$ to the right side:\n$$ x \\, dx = \\left( \\frac{r\\gamma_{LV}\\cos\\theta}{4\\mu} \\right) dt $$\nWe integrate this equation from the initial condition, where the front is at $x'=0$ at time $t'=0$, to a final state with position $x$ at time $t$:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{x} x' \\, dx' = \\int_{0}^{t} \\left( \\frac{r\\gamma_{LV}\\cos\\theta}{4\\mu} \\right) dt' $$\nPerforming the integration yields:\n$$ \\left[ \\frac{x'^2}{2} \\right]_{0}^{x} = \\left( \\frac{r\\gamma_{LV}\\cos\\theta}{4\\mu} \\right) [t']_{0}^{t} $$\n$$ \\frac{x^2}{2} = \\left( \\frac{r\\gamma_{LV}\\cos\\theta}{4\\mu} \\right) t $$\nThis result, known as the Lucas-Washburn equation, shows that the square of the imbibition distance is proportional to time.\n\nFinally, we solve for the time $t$ required to reach a specific distance $x$:\n$$ t = \\frac{x^2}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4\\mu}{r\\gamma_{LV}\\cos\\theta} = \\frac{2\\mu x^2}{r\\gamma_{LV}\\cos\\theta} $$\n\nStep 4: Numerical Evaluation\nThe given parameters must first be converted to base SI units:\n- Mean pore radius: $r = 0.2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 0.2 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- Liquid–vapor surface tension: $\\gamma_{LV} = 0.035\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$\n- Static contact angle: $\\theta = 60^\\circ$, so $\\cos\\theta = \\cos(60^\\circ) = 0.5$\n- Dynamic viscosity: $\\mu = 2\\,\\mathrm{mPa\\,s} = 2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\,s}$\n- Target imbibition distance: $x = 50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 50 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n\nSubstitute these values into the expression for $t$:\n$$ t = \\frac{2(2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa\\,s})(50 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2}{(0.2 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m})(0.035\\,\\mathrm{N/m})(0.5)} $$\n$$ t = \\frac{2(2 \\times 10^{-3})(2500 \\times 10^{-12})}{(0.2 \\times 10^{-6})(0.035)(0.5)}\\,\\mathrm{s} $$\n$$ t = \\frac{1 \\times 10^{-11}}{3.5 \\times 10^{-9}}\\,\\mathrm{s} $$\n$$ t \\approx 0.00285714\\,\\mathrm{s} $$\nThe problem requires the answer in milliseconds (ms) and rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ t \\approx 2.85714\\,\\mathrm{ms} $$\nRounding to three significant figures gives:\n$$ t \\approx 2.86\\,\\mathrm{ms} $$",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an expression for intrinsic permeability and its subsequent numerical evaluation, along with the calculation of the Darcy velocity for a given pressure gradient in a porous battery separator. The analysis is based on established principles of transport phenomena in porous media.\n\nThe governing physics for steady, incompressible, creeping flow (low Reynolds number) of a Newtonian fluid through a porous medium is described by the Stokes equations at the pore scale. The macroscopic (volume-averaged) behavior is described by Darcy's law, which serves as a homogenized momentum closure. Darcy's law relates the superficial velocity vector $\\boldsymbol{u}$ (also known as the Darcy flux) to the macroscopic pressure gradient $\\nabla p$ and the fluid's dynamic viscosity $\\mu$ via the intrinsic permeability $k$ of the medium.

This is achieved through the Kozeny-Carman model, which provides a microstructure-based closure for permeability.\n\nThe Kozeny-Carman equation models the porous medium as a bundle of tortuous capillaries. The permeability is related to the porosity and the specific surface area of the pore walls. The standard form of the Kozeny-Carman equation is:\n$$\nk = \\frac{\\varepsilon^3}{K S_v^2}\n$$\nwhere $S_v$ is the specific surface area defined with respect to the *total volume* of the porous medium, and $K$ is the dimensionless Kozeny constant that accounts for tortuosity and pore shape factors.\n\nThe problem provides the specific surface area $S$ defined with respect to the *solid volume*.

Let the pore have a radius $r$. The electrolyte, with surface tension $\\gamma$, is pushed into the pore by an external pressure $p_{\\text{ext}}$. The pore is initially filled with gas at pressure $p_{g}$. The contact angle between the electrolyte and the pore wall is $\\theta$. We are interested in the non-wetting case, where $\\theta  90^{\\circ}$.\n\nInfiltration requires that the total force pushing the electrolyte into the pore exceeds the total force resisting its entry. We consider a thin slug of liquid at the meniscus. The forces are acting on the circular cross-section of area $A = \\pi r^2$.\n\nThe force driving the electrolyte into the pore is due to the external pressure:\n$$F_{\\text{driving}} = p_{\\text{ext}} A = p_{\\text{ext}} (\\pi r^2)$$\n\nThe forces resisting entry are the pressure of the trapped gas and the capillary force arising from surface tension. The force from the gas pressure is:\n$$F_{\\text{gas}} = p_{g} A = p_{g} (\\pi r^2)$$\n\nThe capillary force acts along the three-phase contact line (liquid-gas-solid), which has a circumference of $L = 2\\pi r$. The surface tension $\\gamma$ is a force per unit length. The component of this force acting parallel to the pore axis opposes the infiltration. This axial force component per unit length is $\\gamma \\cos(\\theta)$. Thus, the total axial force due to surface tension is:\n$$F_{\\text{capillary}} = L (\\gamma \\cos(\\theta)) = (2\\pi r) \\gamma \\cos(\\theta)$$\nSince we consider a non-wetting system with $\\theta  90^{\\circ}$, the value of $\\cos(\\theta)$ is negative. This means $F_{\\text{capillary}}$ is a negative force, indicating that it acts in the direction opposite to infiltration, i.e., it is a resisting force. The magnitude of this resistive force is $|F_{\\text{capillary}}| = - (2\\pi r) \\gamma \\cos(\\theta)$.\n\nThe total resisting force is the sum of the gas pressure force and the capillary resisting force:\n$$F_{\\text{resisting}} = F_{\\text{gas}} + |F_{\\text{capillary}}| = p_{g}(\\pi r^2) - (2\\pi r) \\gamma \\cos(\\theta)$$\n\nFor the electrolyte to infiltrate the pore, the driving force must be greater than the total resisting force:\n$$F_{\\text{driving}}  F_{\\text{resisting}}$$\n$$p_{\\text{ext}}(\\pi r^2)  p_{g}(\\pi r^2) - (2\\pi r) \\gamma \\cos(\\theta)$$\n\nDividing the entire inequality by the area $A = \\pi r^2$:\n$$p_{\\text{ext}}  p_{g} - \\frac{(2\\pi r) \\gamma \\cos(\\theta)}{\\pi r^2}$$\n$$p_{\\text{ext}}  p_{g} - \\frac{2\\gamma \\cos(\\theta)}{r}$$\n\nRearranging gives the condition for forced infiltration in terms of the external overpressure, $\\Delta p = p_{\\text{ext}} - p_{g}$:\n$$\\Delta p  -\\frac{2\\gamma \\cos(\\theta)}{r}$$\nSince $\\theta  90^{\\circ}$, $\\cos(\\theta)$ is negative, and the right-hand side of the inequality is a positive quantity, representing the capillary pressure barrier that must be overcome.\n\nArrested imbibition occurs when the driving overpressure is insufficient to overcome this capillary barrier, i.e., when the inequality is not satisfied:\n$$\\Delta p \\le -\\frac{2\\gamma \\cos(\\theta)}{r}$$\nThis inequality distinguishes arrested imbibition from forced infiltration for $\\theta  90^{\\circ}$.\n\nPart 2: Calculation of the Largest Non-wetting Contact Angle\n\nWe are asked to find the largest non-wetting contact angle $\\theta$ for which infiltration is possible. This corresponds to the threshold condition where the applied overpressure is just equal to the capillary barrier. This is the boundary of the inequality derived above:\n$$p_{\\text{ext}} - p_{g} = -\\frac{2\\gamma \\cos(\\theta)}{r}$$\n\nWe can solve this equation for $\\cos(\\theta)$:\n$$\\cos(\\theta) = -\\frac{(p_{\\text{ext}} - p_{g}) r}{2\\gamma}$$\n\nThe question asks for the *largest* non-wetting angle $\\theta$ (where $90^{\\circ}  \\theta \\le 180^{\\circ}$). In this angular range, the cosine function is monotonically decreasing. This means that a larger value of $\\theta$ corresponds to a smaller (more negative) value of $\\cos(\\theta)$. The equality we have derived defines the minimum possible value for $\\cos(\\theta)$ for infiltration to occur. Any angle $\\theta'$ larger than the one found from the equality would yield $\\cos(\\theta')  \\cos(\\theta)$, which would violate the infiltration condition $\\cos(\\theta')  -\\frac{(p_{\\text{ext}} - p_{g}) r}{2\\gamma}$. Therefore, the angle derived from the equality is the maximum possible angle for infiltration.\n\nLet's denote this maximum angle as $\\theta_{\\text{max}}$. We can calculate it using the arccosine function:\n$$\\theta_{\\text{max}} = \\arccos\\left(-\\frac{(p_{\\text{ext}} - p_{g}) r}{2\\gamma}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n- Overpressure, $p_{\\text{ext}} - p_{g} = 2.0 \\times 10^{5}~\\text{Pa}$\n- Pore radius, $r = 1.5 \\times 10^{-7}~\\text{m}$\n- Surface tension, $\\gamma = 3.5 \\times 10^{-2}~\\text{N}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we compute the argument of the arccosine function. We verify that all units are in the SI system, ensuring a dimensionless result for the argument.\n$$-\\frac{(p_{\\text{ext}} - p_{g}) r}{2\\gamma} = -\\frac{(2.0 \\times 10^{5}~\\text{Pa}) \\times (1.5 \\times 10^{-7}~\\text{m})}{2 \\times (3.5 \\times 10^{-2}~\\text{N}\\,\\text{m}^{-1})}$$\n$$= -\\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{-2}~\\text{N}\\,\\text{m}^{-2} \\cdot \\text{m}}{7.0 \\times 10^{-2}~\\text{N}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}}$$\n$$= -\\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{-2}}{7.0 \\times 10^{-2}} = -\\frac{3}{7}$$\n\nThe value of the argument is approximately $-0.42857$. This value is within the domain of the arccosine function, $[-1, 1]$.\n\nNow, we compute the angle $\\theta_{\\text{max}}$:\n$$\\theta_{\\text{max}} = \\arccos\\left(-\\frac{3}{7}\\right)$$\nThe result must be expressed in degrees.\n$$\\theta_{\\text{max}} \\approx \\arccos(-0.4285714...) \\approx 115.3769...^{\\circ}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\theta_{\\text{max}} \\approx 115.4^{\\circ}$$\n\nThis is the largest non-wetting contact angle for which the given external overpressure is sufficient to force the electrolyte into the separator pores.",
