A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis begins with the grand potential, $\\Phi$, defined as:\n$$ \\Phi = E - \\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}} N_{\\mathrm{Li}} $$\nwhere $E$ is the total energy of a given phase, $N_{\\mathrm{Li}}$ is the number of lithium atoms in that phase's formula unit, and $\\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}}$ is the chemical potential of lithium, which is set by an external reservoir.\n\nWe apply this definition to the two cathode phases: the delithiated phase ($\\mathrm{CoO_2}$) and the lithiated phase ($\\mathrm{LiCoO_2}$).\n\nFor the delithiated phase, $\\mathrm{CoO_2}$:\nThe number of lithium atoms per formula unit is $N_{\\mathrm{Li}} = 0$. The total energy is $E_{\\mathrm{CoO_2}}$. Therefore, its grand potential is:\n$$ \\Phi_{\\mathrm{CoO_2}} = E_{\\mathrm{CoO_2}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}} (0) = E_{\\mathrm{CoO_2}} $$\n\nFor the lithiated phase, $\\mathrm{LiCoO_2}$:\nThe number of lithium atoms per formula unit is $N_{\\mathrm{Li}} = 1$. The total energy is $E_{\\mathrm{LiCoO_2}}$. Therefore, its grand potential is:\n$$ \\Phi_{\\mathrm{LiCoO_2}} = E_{\\mathrm{LiCoO_2}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}} (1) = E_{\\mathrm{LiCoO_2}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}} $$\n\nTwo-phase equilibrium between $\\mathrm{CoO_2}$ and $\\mathrm{LiCoO_2}$ occurs at the specific lithium chemical potential, denoted $\\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}}^{\\ast}$, where their grand potentials are equal.\n$$ \\Phi_{\\mathrm{CoO_2}} = \\Phi_{\\mathrm{LiCoO_2}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the grand potentials:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{CoO_2}} = E_{\\mathrm{LiCoO_2}} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}}^{\\ast} $$\nSolving for the equilibrium chemical potential $\\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}}^{\\ast}$:\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}}^{\\ast} = E_{\\mathrm{LiCoO_2}} - E_{\\mathrm{CoO_2}} $$\nThis value, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}}^{\\ast}$, represents the chemical potential of lithium within the cathode material during the two-phase reaction.\n\nThe open-circuit voltage, $V$, is measured against a lithium metal reference electrode (anode). The voltage arises from the difference in the chemical potential of lithium between the cathode and the anode. The chemical potential of lithium in the anode is that of bulk metallic lithium, which at zero temperature is simply its total energy per atom:\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}}^{\\mathrm{ref}} = E_{\\mathrm{Li}}^{\\mathrm{metal}} $$\nThe overall cell reaction is $\\mathrm{CoO_2} + \\mathrm{Li(metal)} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{LiCoO_2}$. The change in Gibbs free energy for this reaction, $\\Delta G$, determines the cell voltage. At $T=0$, the Gibbs free energy change equals the total energy change, $\\Delta E$. For one formula unit of reaction:\n$$ \\Delta E = E_{\\mathrm{products}} - E_{\\mathrm{reactants}} = E_{\\mathrm{LiCoO_2}} - (E_{\\mathrm{CoO_2}} + E_{\\mathrm{Li}}^{\\mathrm{metal}}) $$\nThis energy change is related to the cell voltage $V$ by the fundamental thermodynamic relation $\\Delta G = -zeV$, where $z$ is the number of elementary charges $e$ transferred per reaction unit. For this reaction, $z=1$. Thus:\n$$ \\Delta E = -eV $$\nSolving for the voltage $V$:\n$$ V = -\\frac{\\Delta E}{e} = -\\frac{E_{\\mathrm{LiCoO_2}} - E_{\\mathrm{CoO_2}} - E_{\\mathrm{Li}}^{\\mathrm{metal}}}{e} $$\nWe can express this voltage in terms of the previously derived chemical potentials. By rearranging the terms:\n$$ V = - \\frac{(E_{\\mathrm{LiCoO_2}} - E_{\\mathrm{CoO_2}}) - E_{\\mathrm{Li}}^{\\mathrm{metal}}}{e} $$\nRecognizing that $\\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}}^{\\ast} = E_{\\mathrm{LiCoO_2}} - E_{\\mathrm{CoO_2}}$ and $\\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}}^{\\mathrm{ref}} = E_{\\mathrm{Li}}^{\\mathrm{metal}}$, we obtain the voltage in the desired form:\n$$ V = - \\frac{\\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}}^{\\ast} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}}^{\\mathrm{ref}}}{e} $$\nSince the energies are given in units of electronvolts ($\\mathrm{eV}$), the numerical value of the voltage in volts ($\\mathrm{V}$) is simply the negative of the chemical potential difference expressed in $\\mathrm{eV}$.\n$$ V (\\text{in Volts}) = -(\\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}}^{\\ast} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}}^{\\mathrm{ref}}) (\\text{in eV}) $$\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{LiCoO_2}} = -531.826~\\mathrm{eV} $$\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{CoO_2}} = -526.137~\\mathrm{eV} $$\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{Li}}^{\\mathrm{metal}} = -1.897~\\mathrm{eV} $$\nFirst, calculate the equilibrium chemical potential in the cathode:\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}}^{\\ast} = E_{\\mathrm{LiCoO_2}} - E_{\\mathrm{CoO_2}} = (-531.826) - (-526.137) = -5.689~\\mathrm{eV} $$\nThe reference chemical potential is:\n$$ \\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}}^{\\mathrm{ref}} = E_{\\mathrm{Li}}^{\\mathrm{metal}} = -1.897~\\mathrm{eV} $$\nFinally, calculate the voltage:\n$$ V = -(\\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}}^{\\ast} - \\mu_{\\mathrm{Li}}^{\\mathrm{ref}}) = -(-5.689 - (-1.897)) $$\n$$ V = -(-5.689 + 1.897) = -(-3.792) $$\n$$ V = 3.792~\\mathrm{V} $$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $3.792$ already has four significant figures.",

            "problem": "In automated high-throughput screening of cathode candidates, a first-principles-informed percolation model is used to predict whether lithium-ion diffusion will exhibit macroscopic connectivity in the presence of transition-metal antisite defects. Consider three canonical crystal families: layered oxide ($\\mathrm{LiMO_{2}}$), spinel ($\\mathrm{LiM_{2}O_{4}}$), and olivine ($\\mathrm{LiMPO_{4}}$), where $M$ is a transition metal. Assume the following physical idealizations grounded in well-tested models of ionic transport and percolation:\n\n1. Lithium diffusion proceeds via nearest-neighbor hops on the sublattice of lithium sites that form the diffusion network appropriate to each structure type:\n   - Layered: two-dimensional triangular network within lithium planes.\n   - Spinel: three-dimensional diamond network of $\\mathrm{A}$-sites (Wyckoff $8a$).\n   - Olivine: effectively one-dimensional chains along the fast-migration axis with negligible interchain coupling.\n\n2. Transition-metal antisite defects are randomly and independently distributed over lithium sites with concentration $c \\in [0,1]$, where $c$ is the fraction of lithium sites substituted by transition metal. A site occupied by an antisite is completely inaccessible to lithium diffusion.\n\n3. Macroscopic transport requires the existence of an infinite percolating cluster of accessible sites in the thermodynamic limit. The onset of percolation is governed by the site percolation threshold $p_{c}$ of the underlying network.\n\nUse the site percolation thresholds below, which are well-established for the corresponding idealized networks:\n- Triangular lattice: $p_{c}^{\\mathrm{tri}} = 0.5000$.\n- Diamond lattice: $p_{c}^{\\mathrm{dia}} = 0.4300$.\n- One-dimensional chain: $p_{c}^{\\mathrm{1D}} = 1.0000$.\n\nStarting from the definitions above and without invoking any additional empirical transport formulas, derive an expression for the critical antisite concentration $c^{\\ast}$ that marks the loss of macroscopic lithium transport for a given network.

Express your final answers as decimal fractions (dimensionless) and round each to four significant figures. Your final answer must be a single row vector with the three values in the order (layered, spinel, olivine).",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the critical antisite concentration, $c^{\\ast}$, at which macroscopic lithium transport ceases in $3$ different cathode crystal structures. The model provided is based on site percolation theory.\n\nLet $p_{acc}$ be the probability that a generic site on the lithium diffusion network is accessible to a lithium ion. The problem states that a site is rendered inaccessible if it is occupied by a transition-metal antisite defect. The concentration of these defects, defined as the fraction of lithium sites they occupy, is given as $c$, where $c \\in [0,1]$. As the defects are stipulated to be randomly and independently distributed, the probability that any given site is an antisite is $c$. Consequently, the probability that a site is *not* an antisite, and is therefore accessible for diffusion, is given by the complementary probability:\n$$p_{acc} = 1 - c$$\n\nMacroscopic transport is possible if and only if the network of accessible sites percolates through the crystal structure. In site percolation theory, an infinite cluster of connected sites forms if the probability of a site being \"occupied\" (in this context, accessible) is greater than or equal to the site percolation threshold, $p_c$, which is a characteristic property of the underlying network's topology. The condition for the existence of macroscopic transport is therefore:\n$$p_{acc} \\ge p_c$$\n\nSubstituting the expression for $p_{acc}$ in terms of the defect concentration $c$, we obtain the condition for transport:\n$$1 - c \\ge p_c$$\n\nThe critical antisite concentration, denoted as $c^{\\ast}$, represents the threshold value of $c$ at which this inequality is saturated. This is the point where macroscopic transport is lost. For defect concentrations $c < c^{\\ast}$, a percolating path exists and transport occurs. At or above this concentration, $c \\ge c^{\\ast}$, the network of accessible sites becomes fragmented, and macroscopic transport ceases. The critical condition is thus defined by the equality:\n$$1 - c^{\\ast} = p_c$$\n\nSolving for $c^{\\ast}$ gives the general expression for the critical antisite concentration:\n$$c^{\\ast} = 1 - p_c$$\n\nThis expression can now be used to compute the specific critical concentrations for the $3$ crystal families by substituting the appropriate percolation thresholds.\n\n1.  **Layered Oxides ($\\mathrm{LiMO_{2}}$)**: The diffusion network is modeled as a $2$-dimensional triangular lattice.

The given site percolation threshold is $p_{c}^{\\mathrm{dia}} = 0.4300$. The critical antisite concentration is:\n    $$c^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{spinel}} = 1 - p_{c}^{\\mathrm{dia}} = 1 - 0.4300 = 0.5700$$\n\n3.  **Olivine Phosphates ($\\mathrm{LiMPO_{4}}$)**: The diffusion network is modeled as effectively $1$-dimensional chains. The site percolation threshold for a $1$-dimensional lattice is exactly $1$, given here as $p_{c}^{\\mathrm{1D}} = 1.0000$. The critical antisite concentration is:\n    $$c^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{olivine}} = 1 - p_{c}^{\\mathrm{1D}} = 1 - 1.0000 = 0.0000$$\n\nThe problem requires the results to be expressed as decimal fractions rounded to $4$ significant figures. The calculated values, $0.5000$, $0.5700$, and $0.0000$, adhere to this requirement. The result $c^{\\ast}_{\\mathrm{olivine}} = 0.0000$ correctly reflects the fact that in a $1$-dimensional system, any single defect is sufficient to break the chain and halt long-range transport.\n\nThe final values for the critical antisite concentration for the layered, spinel, and olivine structures are $0.5000$, $0.5700$, and $0.0000$, respectively.",

A negative $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{release}}$ indicates an exothermic, spontaneous process, while a positive value indicates an endothermic, non-spontaneous process.\n\nThis overall reaction can be conceptually broken down into two steps:\n1.  The removal of two oxygen atoms from the lattice to a state of isolated atoms in a vacuum. The energy cost for this step is given as $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{remove}}$ per atom. For two atoms, the cost is $2 \\times \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{remove}}$.\n2.  The formation of one gas-phase $\\mathrm{O}_2$ molecule from these two isolated oxygen atoms. The energy change for this step is given as $E(\\mathrm{O}_2)$.\n\nTherefore, the total energy for the oxygen release reaction is the sum of the energies of these two steps:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{release}} = 2 \\times \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{remove}} + E(\\mathrm{O}_2)\n$$\nWe are given the following values:\n-   $E(\\mathrm{O}_2) = -5.20~\\mathrm{eV}$\n-   $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{remove}}^{\\mathrm{layer}} = +2.00~\\mathrm{eV}$ for the layered oxide $\\mathrm{Ni}_{0.5}\\mathrm{Mn}_{0.5}\\mathrm{O}_2$.\n-   $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{remove}}^{\\mathrm{olivine}} = +4.00~\\mathrm{eV}$ for the olivine compound $\\mathrm{FePO}_4$.\n\nUsing these values, we can calculate the oxygen release energy for each structure.\n\nFor the layered oxide:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{release}}^{\\mathrm{layer}} = 2 \\times (+2.00~\\mathrm{eV}) + (-5.20~\\mathrm{eV}) = +4.00~\\mathrm{eV} - 5.20~\\mathrm{eV} = -1.20~\\mathrm{eV}\n$$\nFor the olivine structure:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{release}}^{\\mathrm{olivine}} = 2 \\times (+4.00~\\mathrm{eV}) + (-5.20~\\mathrm{eV}) = +8.00~\\mathrm{eV} - 5.20~\\mathrm{eV} = +2.80~\\mathrm{eV}\n$$\nThe negative value for $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{release}}^{\\mathrm{layer}}$ indicates that the oxygen release process is exothermic for the fully delithiated layered oxide. In contrast, the large positive value for $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{release}}^{\\mathrm{olivine}}$ indicates the process is strongly endothermic for the delithiated olivine. This quantitatively demonstrates why layered oxides are significantly more prone to oxygen release at high states of charge.\n\nThe fundamental reason for this difference lies in the bonding and electronic structure of the two materials.\n\nIn the olivine structure, represented by $\\mathrm{FePO}_4$, the oxygen atoms are part of a phosphate polyanion, $(\\mathrm{PO}_4)^{3-}$. Within this tetrahedral unit, the phosphorus and oxygen atoms are linked by strong, highly stable covalent P-O bonds. The oxidation state of phosphorus is P$^{5+}$ and oxygen is O$^{2-}$. Removing an oxygen atom from this immensely stable covalent framework is energetically very costly, as it requires breaking these strong P-O bonds. This is reflected in the high energy cost $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{remove}}^{\\mathrm{olivine}} = +4.00~\\mathrm{eV}$.\n\nIn the layered transition-metal oxide, $\\mathrm{Ni}_{0.5}\\mathrm{Mn}_{0.5}\\mathrm{O}_2$, the bonding is primarily between the transition-metal cations and the oxygen anions. In the fully charged (delithiated) state, the transition metals are forced into very high oxidation states. For instance, in the parent $\\mathrm{LiNiO}_2$, Ni is initially Ni$^{3+}$; upon charging to $\\mathrm{NiO}_2$, it approaches Ni$^{4+}$. In $\\mathrm{Ni}_{0.5}\\mathrm{Mn}_{0.5}\\mathrm{O}_2$, the Mn is stable as Mn$^{4+}$, while the Ni is oxidized towards Ni$^{4+}$ upon delithiation. These high oxidation states are electronically unstable. The system can lower its total energy by reducing the transition-metal cations to more stable, lower oxidation states (e.g., Ni$^{4+} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}$). This reduction is achieved by an internal redox reaction where lattice oxygen anions (O$^{2-}$) are oxidized, providing the necessary electrons. This oxidation of oxygen can lead to the formation of peroxo-like species or, ultimately, the release of $\\mathrm{O}_2$ gas. The energy released by the reduction of the unstable high-valent transition metals partially compensates for the energy required to remove the oxygen atom from the lattice. Consequently, the net energy cost, $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{remove}}^{\\mathrm{layer}}$, is much lower at $+2.00~\\mathrm{eV}$.\n\nIn summary, the stability of the olivine stems from its strong, covalent $(\\mathrm{PO}_4)^{3-}$ polyanion framework, while the instability of the layered oxide arises from the electronically unstable high-oxidation-state transition metals in the charged state, which can be stabilized via reduction coupled with oxygen release.\n\nFinally, we compute the exothermicity of the oxygen release process for the layered oxide per mole of $\\mathrm{O}_2$ in units of $\\mathrm{kJ/mol}$. The energy change per molecule of $\\mathrm{O}_2$ released is $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{release}}^{\\mathrm{layer}} = -1.20~\\mathrm{eV}$. To convert this to $\\mathrm{kJ/mol}$, we use Avogadro's number, $N_A \\approx 6.02214 \\times 10^{23}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, and the elementary charge, $e \\approx 1.60218 \\times 10^{-19}\\ \\mathrm{C}$. The conversion factor from $\\mathrm{eV}$ per particle to $\\mathrm{J/mol}$ is the product $e \\times N_A$, which is the Faraday constant $F \\approx 96485\\ \\mathrm{J/(mol \\cdot V)}$.
