By working through a simple single-state scenario with entropy regularization, you will derive the optimal policy parameterization from first principles . This exercise illuminates how an agent's choices directly reflect the balance between exploitation of known rewards and the intrinsic drive to explore, a cornerstone of advanced reinforcement learning.",

            "problem": "Consider a single-state Markov Decision Process (MDP) with state $s$, action set $\\mathcal{A} = \\{0,1\\}$, and deterministic rewards $r(s,1) = r_{1}$ and $r(s,0) = r_{0}$, where $r_{1}$ and $r_{0}$ are real numbers. The environment transitions deterministically back to $s$ regardless of the chosen action. The agent employs a stationary stochastic policy $\\pi_{\\theta}(a \\mid s)$ parameterized by a scalar parameter $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}$ via a Boltzmann (softmax) parameterization over action logits, with logits defined by $\\ell(1) = \\theta$ and $\\ell(0) = 0$. The temperature is implicitly absorbed into the parameterization. Thus, the policy satisfies\n$$\n\\pi_{\\theta}(1 \\mid s) = \\frac{\\exp(\\theta)}{\\exp(\\theta) + \\exp(0)}, \\quad \\pi_{\\theta}(0 \\mid s) = \\frac{\\exp(0)}{\\exp(\\theta) + \\exp(0)}.\n$$\nThe agent aims to maximize a discounted entropy-regularized objective with discount factor $\\gamma \\in (0,1)$ and entropy coefficient $\\lambda > 0$. Specifically, the agent maximizes the expected discounted sum of per-step immediate rewards plus a Shannon entropy bonus weighted by $\\lambda$, where the per-step Shannon entropy of the policy at state $s$ is given by\n$$\nH(\\pi_{\\theta}(\\cdot \\mid s)) = - \\sum_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}} \\pi_{\\theta}(a \\mid s) \\ln \\big(\\pi_{\\theta}(a \\mid s)\\big).\n$$\nStarting strictly from the foundational definitions of expected discounted return, stationary policies, and Shannon entropy, derive the exact closed-form expression for the unique optimal parameter $\\theta^{\\star}$ that maximizes the objective. Express your final answer as a single analytic expression in terms of $r_{1}$, $r_{0}$, and $\\lambda$. No numerical evaluation is required, and no rounding is necessary. The answer must be a single closed-form expression.",

Since the state is always $s$, the value function at state $s$ for a policy $\\pi_{\\theta}$ is the objective we want to maximize. Let's call it $J(\\theta)$.\n        *   The agent is always in state $s$. At each time step $t=0, 1, 2, ...$, the agent takes an action $a_t \\sim \\pi_{\\theta}(\\cdot|s)$.\n        *   The immediate reward at step $t$ is a random variable $R_{t+1}$ which depends on the action $a_t$. The expectation of the immediate reward is:\n            $E_{\\pi_{\\theta}}[R_{t+1}] = \\sum_{a \\in \\mathcal{A}} \\pi_{\\theta}(a|s) r(s, a) = \\pi_{\\theta}(1|s) r_1 + \\pi_{\\theta}(0|s) r_0$.\n        *   The entropy bonus at each step is also constant since the policy is stationary and there's only one state: $\\lambda H(\\pi_{\\theta}(\\cdot|s))$.\n        *   The total per-step augmented reward is $E[R_{t+1}] + \\lambda H(\\pi_{\\theta}(\\cdot|s))$.\n        *   The objective function is the expected discounted sum of these augmented rewards:\n            $J(\\theta) = E_{\\pi_{\\theta}} \\left[ \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\gamma^t (R_{t+1} + \\lambda H(\\pi_{\\theta}(\\cdot|s))) \\right]$.\n        *   Since the per-step augmented reward is constant in expectation, we can pull it out of the sum:\n            $J(\\theta) = \\left( E[R_{t+1}] + \\lambda H(\\pi_{\\theta}(\\cdot|s)) \\right) \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\gamma^t$.\n        *   The geometric series sums to $\\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\gamma^t = \\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}$.\n        *   So, $J(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{1-\\gamma} \\left( \\pi_{\\theta}(1|s) r_1 + \\pi_{\\theta}(0|s) r_0 + \\lambda H(\\pi_{\\theta}(\\cdot|s)) \\right)$.\n        *   To maximize $J(\\theta)$, we can ignore the constant positive factor $\\frac{1}{1-\\gamma}$ and just maximize the term inside the parenthesis. Let's define the simplified objective function $L(\\theta)$:\n            $L(\\theta) = \\pi_{\\theta}(1|s) r_1 + \\pi_{\\theta}(0|s) r_0 + \\lambda H(\\pi_{\\theta}(\\cdot|s))$.\n\n    *   **Substitute Policy and Entropy Expressions:**\n        *   Let $p_1 = \\pi_{\\theta}(1|s) = \\frac{\\exp(\\theta)}{\\exp(\\theta) + 1}$ and $p_0 = \\pi_{\\theta}(0|s) = \\frac{1}{\\exp(\\theta) + 1}$.\n        *   Also note that $p_1$ is the sigmoid function of $\\theta$, often written as $\\sigma(\\theta)$. So $p_0 = 1 - p_1 = 1 - \\sigma(\\theta) = \\sigma(-\\theta)$.\n        *   The entropy term is:\n            $H(\\pi_{\\theta}(\\cdot|s)) = -(p_1 \\ln(p_1) + p_0 \\ln(p_0))$.\n        *   Substitute these into $L(\\theta)$:\n            $L(\\theta) = p_1 r_1 + p_0 r_0 - \\lambda (p_1 \\ln(p_1) + p_0 \\ln(p_0))$.\n        *   Now substitute the expressions for $p_1$ and $p_0$ in terms of $\\theta$:\n            $p_1 = \\frac{\\exp(\\theta)}{\\exp(\\theta)+1}$\n            $p_0 = \\frac{1}{\\exp(\\theta)+1}$\n            $\\ln(p_1) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\exp(\\theta)}{\\exp(\\theta) + 1}\\right) = \\theta - \\ln(\\exp(\\theta) + 1)$\n            $\\ln(p_0) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{\\exp(\\theta) + 1}\\right) = - \\ln(\\exp(\\theta) + 1)$\n        *   Let's plug these into the entropy term:\n            $H = -[ p_1(\\theta - \\ln(\\exp(\\theta)+1)) + p_0(-\\ln(\\exp(\\theta)+1)) ]$\n            $H = -[ p_1 \\theta - (p_1+p_0)\\ln(\\exp(\\theta)+1) ]$\n            Since $p_1+p_0 = 1$:\n            $H = -[ p_1 \\theta - \\ln(\\exp(\\theta)+1) ]$\n            $H = \\ln(\\exp(\\theta)+1) - p_1 \\theta$\n        *   Now substitute this entropy expression back into $L(\\theta)$:\n            $L(\\theta) = p_1 r_1 + p_0 r_0 + \\lambda (\\ln(\\exp(\\theta)+1) - p_1 \\theta)$\n        *   Use $p_0 = 1-p_1$:\n            $L(\\theta) = p_1 r_1 + (1-p_1)r_0 + \\lambda (\\ln(\\exp(\\theta)+1) - p_1 \\theta)$\n            $L(\\theta) = p_1(r_1 - r_0) + r_0 + \\lambda \\ln(\\exp(\\theta)+1) - \\lambda p_1 \\theta$\n            $L(\\theta) = p_1 (r_1 - r_0 - \\lambda \\theta) + r_0 + \\lambda \\ln(\\exp(\\theta)+1)$\n        *   Substitute $p_1 = \\frac{\\exp(\\theta)}{\\exp(\\theta)+1}$:\n            $L(\\theta) = \\frac{\\exp(\\theta)}{\\exp(\\theta)+1} (r_1 - r_0 - \\lambda \\theta) + r_0 + \\lambda \\ln(\\exp(\\theta)+1)$\n            This form looks a bit complex to differentiate.

The logic is that the optimal logit difference should be proportional to the reward difference, scaled by the entropy coefficient (which acts like a temperature). If $\\lambda$ is large (high temperature), the agent becomes more random and the logits are pushed towards zero, so $\\theta^{\\star}$ is small. If $\\lambda$ is small (low temperature), the agent is more exploitative and the optimal logit $\\theta^{\\star}$ is large, reflecting the reward difference more strongly. If $r_1  r_0$, $\\theta^{\\star}  0$, favoring action 1. If $r_1  r_0$, $\\theta^{\\star}  0$, favoring action 0. If $r_1 = r_0$, $\\theta^{\\star} = 0$, leading to a uniform policy $\\pi(1|s) = \\pi(0|s) = 0.5$, which makes sense as there's no reward incentive to prefer one action, so the agent maximizes entropy. The result is physically and intuitively consistent with the principles of entropy-regularized RL.\n\n    *   The steps are:\n        1.  Formulate the objective function $J(\\theta)$ which is the value function $V^{\\pi_\\theta}(s)$.\n        2.  Show that maximizing $J(\\theta)$ is equivalent to maximizing a simpler term $L(\\theta)$.\n        3.  Express $L(\\theta)$ in terms of the parameter $\\theta$.\n        4.

            "solution": "The problem is well-posed and scientifically grounded within the theory of Markov Decision Processes. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe discounted value function for a state $s$ under a fixed policy is given by the expectation of the sum of discounted future rewards:\n$$\nV_{\\gamma}(s) = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\gamma^{t} \\, r(s_{t}) \\,\\bigg|\\, s_{0} = s \\right]\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma \\in (0,1)$ is the discount factor, $s_t$ is the state at time $t$, and $r(s_t)$ is the reward received in state $s_t$.\n\nWe can express this using the Bellman equation for a fixed policy.

Let $V_{\\gamma}$ be the column vector of value functions, $V_{\\gamma} = \\begin{pmatrix} V_{\\gamma}(s_1) \\\\ V_{\\gamma}(s_2) \\end{pmatrix}$, and $r$ be the column vector of rewards, $r = \\begin{pmatrix} r(s_1) \\\\ r(s_2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}$. The transition matrix is $P = \\begin{pmatrix} P(s_1|s_1)  P(s_2|s_1) \\\\ P(s_1|s_2)  P(s_2|s_2) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.7  0.3 \\\\ 0.4  0.6 \\end{pmatrix}$. The Bellman equation becomes:\n$$\nV_{\\gamma} = r + \\gamma P V_{\\gamma}\n$$\nThis is a system of linear equations for the vector $V_{\\gamma}$. We can solve for $V_{\\gamma}$:\n$$\n(I - \\gamma P) V_{\\gamma} = r\n$$\nwhere $I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix. For $\\gamma \\in (0,1)$, the matrix $(I-\\gamma P)$ is guaranteed to be invertible. The eigenvalues of a stochastic matrix $P$ have magnitude less than or equal to $1$. Thus, the eigenvalues of $\\gamma P$ have magnitude strictly less than $1$, which means $1$ is not an eigenvalue of $\\gamma P$, so $I - \\gamma P$ is non-singular. The solution is:\n$$\nV_{\\gamma} = (I - \\gamma P)^{-1} r\n$$\nThis gives the explicit expression for the value function vector in terms of $P$ and $r$.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the limit:\n$$\nL = \\lim_{\\gamma \\uparrow 1} \\, (1 - \\gamma)\\, V_{\\gamma}(s_{1})\n$$\nThis corresponds to the first component of the vector limit $\\lim_{\\gamma \\uparrow 1} (1 - \\gamma) V_{\\gamma}$.

The factor $(1 - \\gamma)$ resolves this singularity. A fundamental result in the theory of finite Markov chains states that the resolvent $(I - \\gamma P)^{-1}$ has a simple pole at $\\gamma = 1$. The residue at this pole is related to the stationary distribution. Specifically, one can show that:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\gamma \\uparrow 1} (1 - \\gamma) (I - \\gamma P)^{-1} = P^*\n$$\nwhere $P^* = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} P^n$.

Substituting $\\pi_1 = 1 - \\pi_2$ from the normalization condition into this equation gives:\n$$\n4 \\pi_2 = 3(1 - \\pi_2) \\implies 4 \\pi_2 = 3 - 3 \\pi_2 \\implies 7 \\pi_2 = 3 \\implies \\pi_2 = \\frac{3}{7}\n$$\nThen, $\\pi_1 = 1 - \\pi_2 = 1 - \\frac{3}{7} = \\frac{4}{7}$.

This constant value is the average reward $\\rho$, which is independent of the initial state for an ergodic chain. We can verify this:\n$$\n\\rho = \\sum_s \\pi(s) r(s) = \\pi r = (\\frac{4}{7}, \\frac{3}{7}) \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{8}{7} + \\frac{3}{7} = \\frac{11}{7}\n$$\nThe problem asks for $L$, which is the limit of the value function starting in state $s_1$:\n$$\nL = \\lim_{\\gamma \\uparrow 1} \\, (1 - \\gamma)\\, V_{\\gamma}(s_{1})\n$$\nThis is the first component of the limit vector we calculated.
