            "problem": "Consider a single-armed Bayesian Bernoulli bandit that is activated at discrete times $t \\in \\{0,1,2,\\dots\\}$. When activated at time $t$, the arm yields a random reward $X_t \\in \\{0,1\\}$ distributed as $\\mathrm{Bernoulli}(\\theta)$, where the unknown success probability $\\theta \\in [0,1]$ has prior distribution $\\mathrm{Beta}(\\alpha,\\beta)$ with parameters $\\alpha>0$ and $\\beta>0$. The posterior over $\\theta$ after observing a success at time $t$ updates to $\\mathrm{Beta}(\\alpha+1,\\beta)$, and after a failure updates to $\\mathrm{Beta}(\\alpha,\\beta+1)$. Future rewards are geometrically discounted with a known factor $\\gamma \\in (0,1)$.

You may assume the validity of the Gittins index theorem for geometrically discounted multi-armed bandits.\n\nStart from first principles consisting of Bayesian belief updating for the Beta-Bernoulli model and the definition of optimal stopping, and derive a rigorous expression for the Gittins index (GI) of this arm at belief state $\\mathrm{Beta}(\\alpha,\\beta)$ with discount factor $\\gamma$. Your derivation should proceed by formulating the optimal stopping problem that compares continuing to sample the arm versus stopping, transforming it into a dynamic program on belief states. Then, using a subsidy-for-continuation formulation, derive the Bellman recursion that defines the value function of the single arm under a per-step subsidy $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$, and characterize the Gittins index as the threshold subsidy that makes the arm just indifferent between continuing and stopping. Clearly state and justify any monotonicity or contraction properties you use to ensure existence and uniqueness of the index.\n\nFinally, as your answer, provide a single analytical expression that defines the Gittins index at belief state $\\mathrm{Beta}(\\alpha,\\beta)$ with discount factor $\\gamma$ as a supremum over stopping times of a ratio of two discounted expectations.

            "solution": "We begin by formalizing the single-arm problem with Bayesian learning and geometric discounting. The state is the belief $(\\alpha,\\beta)$ over the unknown success probability $\\theta$, with prior and posterior distributions in the conjugate family $\\mathrm{Beta}(\\alpha,\\beta)$. The arm, when activated, yields reward $X_t \\in \\{0,1\\}$ with conditional distribution $X_t \\mid \\theta \\sim \\mathrm{Bernoulli}(\\theta)$. The posterior updating rule is a well-known fact for the Beta-Bernoulli model: if the current belief is $\\mathrm{Beta}(\\alpha,\\beta)$, observing a success updates the belief to $\\mathrm{Beta}(\\alpha+1,\\beta)$ and a failure updates it to $\\mathrm{Beta}(\\alpha,\\beta+1)$. The posterior mean at belief $(\\alpha,\\beta)$ is $\\mu(\\alpha,\\beta) = \\alpha/(\\alpha+\\beta)$.\n\nThe Gittins index provides, for geometrically discounted multi-armed bandits, a decomposition of the optimal allocation policy into a per-arm index maximization policy. For a single arm, the Gittins index at a belief state is the value of an associated one-dimensional optimal stopping problem, which we now construct from first principles.\n\nDefine a stopping time $\\tau$ (with respect to the filtration $\\{\\mathcal{F}_t\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ generated by the observed rewards) as the time at which we stop sampling the arm. Under geometric discounting with factor $\\gamma \\in (0,1)$, and starting from belief $(\\alpha,\\beta)$, the expected discounted reward obtained by sampling the arm up to (but not including) time $\\tau$ is\n$$\nR(\\alpha,\\beta;\\tau) \\equiv \\mathbb{E}_{\\alpha,\\beta}\\!\\left[ \\sum_{t=0}^{\\tau-1} \\gamma^{t} X_t \\right],\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbb{E}_{\\alpha,\\beta}[\\cdot]$ denotes expectation with respect to the joint law induced by the prior $\\theta \\sim \\mathrm{Beta}(\\alpha,\\beta)$ and the conditional draws $X_t \\mid \\theta$ under the stopping rule $\\tau$. The discounted time accumulated up to $\\tau$ is\n$$\nT(\\tau) \\equiv \\mathbb{E}_{\\alpha,\\beta}\\!\\left[ \\sum_{t=0}^{\\tau-1} \\gamma^{t} \\right].\n$$\nBoth $R(\\alpha,\\beta;\\tau)$ and $T(\\tau)$ are finite because $\\gamma \\in (0,1)$ implies $\\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\gamma^t < \\infty$ and the rewards are bounded in $[0,1]$.\n\nThe optimal stopping problem underlying the Gittins index takes the form of maximizing the ratio of expected discounted reward to expected discounted time over all admissible stopping times:\n$$\n\\mathcal{G}(\\alpha,\\beta;\\gamma) \\equiv \\sup_{\\tau \\in \\mathcal{T}} \\frac{R(\\alpha,\\beta;\\tau)}{T(\\tau)},\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{T}$ is the set of all stopping times with respect to $\\{\\mathcal{F}_t\\}$ taking values in $\\{1,2,\\dots\\}$. This ratio interpretation can be obtained by considering the Lagrangian or subsidy formulation, which we now derive to produce the dynamic programming recursion.\n\nIntroduce a per-period subsidy $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}$ for continuing to sample the arm, and define the value function under subsidy $\\lambda$ as the maximal expected discounted net reward:\n$$\nV^{\\lambda}(\\alpha,\\beta) \\equiv \\sup_{\\tau \\in \\mathcal{T}} \\mathbb{E}_{\\alpha,\\beta}\\!\\left[ \\sum_{t=0}^{\\tau-1} \\gamma^{t} \\big( X_t - \\lambda \\big) \\right].\n$$\nThis is the value of an optimal stopping problem on the belief-state Markov chain induced by Beta-Bernoulli updating. The process on beliefs is a time-homogeneous Markov chain on the countable state space $\\{(\\alpha+i,\\beta+j): i,j \\in \\mathbb{N}_0\\}$, and geometric discounting with $\\gamma \\in (0,1)$ ensures that the Bellman equation for $V^{\\lambda}$ is a contraction mapping.\n\nBy the principle of optimality, at belief $(\\alpha,\\beta)$, the Bellman recursion is\n$$\nV^{\\lambda}(\\alpha,\\beta)\n=\n\\max \\Big\\{ 0,\\, \\underbrace{\\mu(\\alpha,\\beta) - \\lambda}_{\\text{net immediate reward}} + \\gamma \\Big[ \\mu(\\alpha,\\beta)\\, V^{\\lambda}(\\alpha+1,\\beta) + \\big(1-\\mu(\\alpha,\\beta)\\big)\\, V^{\\lambda}(\\alpha,\\beta+1) \\Big] \\Big\\},\n$$\nwith $\\mu(\\alpha,\\beta) = \\alpha/(\\alpha+\\beta)$. The two terms inside the maximum correspond to stopping immediately (yielding $0$ continuation value because we define the post-stop value to be $0$) and continuing for one more play (collecting the expected immediate net reward $\\mu(\\alpha,\\beta)-\\lambda$ plus the discounted expected continuation value, where the next belief is $(\\alpha+1,\\beta)$ with probability $\\mu(\\alpha,\\beta)$ and $(\\alpha,\\beta+1)$ with probability $1-\\mu(\\alpha,\\beta)$).\n\nStandard arguments for discounted optimal stopping in a bounded-reward, time-homogeneous Markov decision process (MDP) imply that for each fixed $\\lambda$, the operator\n$$\n\\mathcal{T}^{\\lambda}[f](\\alpha,\\beta)\n=\n\\max \\Big\\{ 0,\\, \\mu(\\alpha,\\beta) - \\lambda + \\gamma \\big[ \\mu(\\alpha,\\beta)\\, f(\\alpha+1,\\beta) + \\big(1-\\mu(\\alpha,\\beta)\\big)\\, f(\\alpha,\\beta+1) \\big] \\Big\\}\n$$\nis a $\\gamma$-contraction on the space of bounded functions equipped with the sup norm. Hence, the Bellman equation has a unique bounded fixed point $V^{\\lambda}$, and value iteration converges to it.\n\nWe now connect $V^{\\lambda}$ to the ratio characterization. For any stopping time $\\tau$,\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}_{\\alpha,\\beta}\\!\\left[ \\sum_{t=0}^{\\tau-1} \\gamma^{t} \\big( X_t - \\lambda \\big) \\right]\n=\nR(\\alpha,\\beta;\\tau) - \\lambda\\, T(\\tau).\n$$\nBy definition of $V^{\\lambda}$, we have $V^{\\lambda}(\\alpha,\\beta) \\ge R(\\alpha,\\beta;\\tau) - \\lambda\\, T(\\tau)$ for all $\\tau$, hence\n$$\n\\lambda \\ge \\frac{R(\\alpha,\\beta;\\tau) - V^{\\lambda}(\\alpha,\\beta)}{T(\\tau)}.\n$$\nWhen $V^{\\lambda}(\\alpha,\\beta) = 0$, this yields\n$$\n\\lambda \\ge \\frac{R(\\alpha,\\beta;\\tau)}{T(\\tau)} \\quad \\text{for all } \\tau \\in \\mathcal{T}.\n$$\nIt follows that if $V^{\\lambda}(\\alpha,\\beta) = 0$, then $\\lambda$ is an upper bound on the ratio $R(\\alpha,\\beta;\\tau)/T(\\tau)$ over all stopping times, so $\\lambda \\ge \\sup_{\\tau \\in \\mathcal{T}} R(\\alpha,\\beta;\\tau)/T(\\tau)$. Conversely, suppose $\\lambda < \\sup_{\\tau \\in \\mathcal{T}} R(\\alpha,\\beta;\\tau)/T(\\tau)$. Then there exists a stopping time $\\tau^{\\star}$ such that $R(\\alpha,\\beta;\\tau^{\\star}) - \\lambda\\, T(\\tau^{\\star}) > 0$, and hence $V^{\\lambda}(\\alpha,\\beta) \\ge R(\\alpha,\\beta;\\tau^{\\star}) - \\lambda\\, T(\\tau^{\\star}) > 0$. Therefore, the set $\\{\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R} : V^{\\lambda}(\\alpha,\\beta) > 0\\}$ is the open interval $(-\\infty, \\mathcal{G}(\\alpha,\\beta;\\gamma))$, and $V^{\\lambda}(\\alpha,\\beta) = 0$ for all $\\lambda \\ge \\mathcal{G}(\\alpha,\\beta;\\gamma)$.\n\nMonotonicity of $V^{\\lambda}$ in $\\lambda$ follows from the Bellman operator: if $\\lambda_1 < \\lambda_2$, then $\\mathcal{T}^{\\lambda_1}[f](\\alpha,\\beta) \\ge \\mathcal{T}^{\\lambda_2}[f](\\alpha,\\beta)$ pointwise for any $f$, and the unique fixed points satisfy $V^{\\lambda_1}(\\alpha,\\beta) \\ge V^{\\lambda_2}(\\alpha,\\beta)$. Together with boundedness and continuity in $\\lambda$, these facts imply the existence and uniqueness of a threshold $\\lambda^{\\star}$ such that $V^{\\lambda}(\\alpha,\\beta) > 0$ for $\\lambda < \\lambda^{\\star}$ and $V^{\\lambda}(\\alpha,\\beta) = 0$ for $\\lambda \\ge \\lambda^{\\star}$. This threshold is precisely the Gittins index, and it coincides with the ratio supremum:\n$$\n\\mathcal{G}(\\alpha,\\beta;\\gamma) = \\sup_{\\tau \\in \\mathcal{T}} \\frac{R(\\alpha,\\beta;\\tau)}{T(\\tau)}.\n$$\n\nFor computation via dynamic programming on belief states, one can fix a candidate subsidy $\\lambda$ and compute $V^{\\lambda}$ by value iteration:\n$$\nV^{\\lambda}_{k+1}(\\alpha,\\beta) \\leftarrow \\max \\Big\\{ 0,\\, \\mu(\\alpha,\\beta) - \\lambda + \\gamma \\big[ \\mu(\\alpha,\\beta)\\, V^{\\lambda}_{k}(\\alpha+1,\\beta) + \\big(1-\\mu(\\alpha,\\beta)\\big)\\, V^{\\lambda}_{k}(\\alpha,\\beta+1) \\big] \\Big\\},\n$$\ninitialized with $V^{\\lambda}_{0}(\\alpha,\\beta) \\equiv 0$ for all $(\\alpha,\\beta)$, which converges uniformly to $V^{\\lambda}$. By monotonicity in $\\lambda$ and the bounds $0 \\le \\mathcal{G}(\\alpha,\\beta;\\gamma) \\le 1$ (since rewards lie in $[0,1]$), a simple bisection search on $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$ yields the unique $\\lambda^{\\star}$ satisfying $V^{\\lambda^{\\star}}(\\alpha,\\beta) = 0$, which is the Gittins index at belief $(\\alpha,\\beta)$.\n\nSummarizing, the Gittins index at belief $\\mathrm{Beta}(\\alpha,\\beta)$ with discount factor $\\gamma$ is the supremum, over all stopping times adapted to the observed rewards, of the ratio of expected discounted reward to expected discounted time:\n$$\n\\mathcal{G}(\\alpha,\\beta;\\gamma) = \\sup_{\\tau \\in \\mathcal{T}} \\frac{ \\mathbb{E}_{\\alpha,\\beta}\\!\\left[ \\sum_{t=0}^{\\tau-1} \\gamma^{t} X_t \\right] }{ \\mathbb{E}_{\\alpha,\\beta}\\!\\left[ \\sum_{t=0}^{\\tau-1} \\gamma^{t} \\right] }.\n$$\nThe dynamic programming recursion that enables computation is given by the subsidy-form Bellman equation\n$$\nV^{\\lambda}(\\alpha,\\beta) = \\max \\Big\\{ 0,\\, \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta} - \\lambda + \\gamma \\Big[ \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}\\, V^{\\lambda}(\\alpha+1,\\beta) + \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta}\\, V^{\\lambda}(\\alpha,\\beta+1) \\Big] \\Big\\},\n$$\nand the Gittins index is\n$$\n\\mathcal{G}(\\alpha,\\beta;\\gamma) = \\inf \\big\\{ \\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R} : V^{\\lambda}(\\alpha,\\beta) = 0 \\big\\} = \\sup \\big\\{ \\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R} : V^{\\lambda}(\\alpha,\\beta) > 0 \\big\\}.\n$$\nAny of these equivalent characterizations defines the same unique real value $\\mathcal{G}(\\alpha,\\beta;\\gamma)$.",

A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Gittins Index for Arm $A$**\n\nThe Gittins index, $c^{\\ast}$, for arm $A$ is defined as the constant reward value of a hypothetical alternative arm that makes the agent indifferent between two initial choices:\n1. Choose the hypothetical arm, receiving reward $c^{\\ast}$ forever. The total discounted value is $V_{C} = \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\gamma^t c^{\\ast} = \\frac{c^{\\ast}}{1-\\gamma}$.\n2. Choose arm $A$ for one time step, observe the outcome, and then proceed optimally. The optimal subsequent action is to choose the arm with the higher perpetual reward stream: the revealed value of arm $A$ or the reservation value $c^{\\ast}$.\n\nThe value of choosing arm $A$ for one step, $V_{A}$, is the sum of the expected immediate reward and the discounted expected future value.\nThe expected immediate reward from pulling arm $A$ at time $t=0$ is $E[R_0] = ph + (1-p)\\ell$.\n\nAfter this pull, the type of arm $A$ is known.\n- With probability $p$, arm $A$ is High-type (reward $h$). The agent will then compare $h$ and $c^{\\ast}$. The optimal choice yields a reward of $\\max(h, c^{\\ast})$ forever. The discounted value of this future stream, as of time $t=1$, is $\\frac{\\max(h, c^{\\ast})}{1-\\gamma}$.\n- With probability $1-p$, arm $A$ is Low-type (reward $\\ell$). The agent will then compare $\\ell$ and $c^{\\ast}$. The optimal choice yields a reward of $\\max(\\ell, c^{\\ast})$ forever. The discounted value of this future stream, as of time $t=1$, is $\\frac{\\max(\\ell, c^{\\ast})}{1-\\gamma}$.\n\nThe total expected discounted value of strategy 2 is:\n$$V_{A} = (ph + (1-p)\\ell) + \\gamma \\left[ p \\frac{\\max(h, c^{\\ast})}{1-\\gamma} + (1-p) \\frac{\\max(\\ell, c^{\\ast})}{1-\\gamma} \\right]$$\nAt the point of indifference, $V_{A} = V_{C}$:\n$$\\frac{c^{\\ast}}{1-\\gamma} = (ph + (1-p)\\ell) + \\frac{\\gamma}{1-\\gamma} \\left[ p \\max(h, c^{\\ast}) + (1-p) \\max(\\ell, c^{\\ast}) \\right]$$\nMultiplying by $(1-\\gamma)$ gives the fundamental equation for the Gittins index:\n$$c^{\\ast} = (1-\\gamma)(ph + (1-p)\\ell) + \\gamma \\left[ p \\max(h, c^{\\ast}) + (1-p) \\max(\\ell, c^{\\ast}) \\right]$$\nTo solve for $c^{\\ast}$, we assume a non-trivial case where $\\ell < c^{\\ast} < h$. This is reasonable because if $c^{\\ast}$ were outside this range, the decision to switch after learning would be foregone (e.g., if $c^{\\ast} \\le \\ell$, one would never switch to the alternative). With this assumption, $\\max(h, c^{\\ast}) = h$ and $\\max(\\ell, c^{\\ast}) = c^{\\ast}$.\nSubstituting these into the equation:\n$$c^{\\ast} = (1-\\gamma)(ph + (1-p)\\ell) + \\gamma \\left[ ph + (1-p)c^{\\ast} \\right]$$\nNow, we solve for $c^{\\ast}$:\n$$c^{\\ast} = ph + (1-p)\\ell - \\gamma ph - \\gamma(1-p)\\ell + \\gamma ph + \\gamma(1-p)c^{\\ast}$$\n$$c^{\\ast} = ph + (1-p)\\ell - \\gamma(1-p)\\ell + \\gamma(1-p)c^{\\ast}$$\n$$c^{\\ast} - \\gamma(1-p)c^{\\ast} = ph + (1-p)(1-\\gamma)\\ell$$\n$$c^{\\ast}(1 - \\gamma(1-p)) = ph + (1-p)(1-\\gamma)\\ell$$\n$$c^{\\ast} = \\frac{ph + (1-p)(1-\\gamma)\\ell}{1 - \\gamma + p\\gamma}$$\nThis is the reservation-value expression for the Gittins index of arm $A$.\n\n**Computations for Specific Parameter Values**\n\nThe given parameters are $\\gamma = 0.9$, $p = 0.3$, $h = 10$, $\\ell = 0$, and $b = 4$.\n\n1. **Gittins Index and Myopic Reward Comparison**\nFirst, we compute the Gittins index $c^{\\ast}$ for arm $A$:\n$$c^{\\ast} = \\frac{(0.3)(10) + (1-0.3)(1-0.9)(0)}{1 - 0.9 + (0.3)(0.9)} = \\frac{3 + 0}{1 - 0.9 + 0.27} = \\frac{3}{0.1 + 0.27} = \\frac{3}{0.37} = \\frac{300}{37}$$\nThe value of the Gittins index is $c^{\\ast} = \\frac{300}{37} \\approx 8.108$.\nThe myopic expected immediate reward is:\n$$E_{myopic} = ph + (1-p)\\ell = (0.3)(10) + (0.7)(0) = 3$$\nComparing the two, $c^{\\ast} = \\frac{300}{37} > 3$. The difference, $c^{\\ast} - E_{myopic}$, represents the \"value of information\" or the option value inherent in being able to switch away from arm $A$ if it turns out to be a Low-type.\n\n2. **Expected Discounted Loss of Myopic Policy**\nThe optimal policy is dictated by the Gittins index rule: at any stage, play the arm with the highest index.\nThe index for arm $A$ is $c^{\\ast} = \\frac{300}{37}$.\nThe index for arm $B$ is its constant reward, $b = 4$.\nSince $c^{\\ast} = \\frac{300}{37} \\approx 8.108 > 4 = b$, the optimal policy is to explore arm $A$ first.\n\nThe problem defines the \"myopic exploitation policy\" as choosing arm $B$ immediately and forever.

This policy starts with pulling arm $A$.\n- The immediate reward is $ph + (1-p)\\ell = 3$.\n- After the pull, we re-evaluate.\n  - With probability $p=0.3$, arm $A$ is High-type ($h=10$). Since $h > b$, we continue with arm $A$. The future discounted value from $t=1$ is $\\frac{h}{1-\\gamma} = \\frac{10}{0.1} = 100$.\n  - With probability $1-p=0.7$, arm $A$ is Low-type ($\\ell=0$). Since $\\ell < b$, we switch to arm $B$. The future discounted value from $t=1$ is $\\frac{b}{1-\\gamma} = \\frac{4}{0.1} = 40$.\n\nThe total expected value for the optimal policy is:\n$$V_{optimal} = (ph + (1-p)\\ell) + \\gamma \\left[ p \\left( \\frac{h}{1-\\gamma} \\right) + (1-p) \\left( \\frac{b}{1-\\gamma} \\right) \\right]$$\n$$V_{optimal} = 3 + 0.9 \\left[ (0.3)(100) + (0.7)(40) \\right]$$\n$$V_{optimal} = 3 + 0.9 \\left[ 30 + 28 \\right]$$\n$$V_{optimal} = 3 + 0.9(58)$$\n$$V_{optimal} = 3 + 52.2 = 55.2$$\n\nThe expected discounted loss incurred by the myopic policy is the difference in value between the optimal policy and the myopic policy.\n$$\\text{Loss} = V_{optimal} - V_{myopic} = 55.2 - 40 = 15.2$$\nThis loss represents the expected value forgone by failing to explore the potentially very rewarding arm $A$.

The optimal arm is the one with the highest true expected reward. Thus, the optimal reward is $\\mu^\\star = \\max\\{\\mu_1, \\mu_2\\} = \\max\\{0.9, 0.5\\} = 0.9$. Arm $1$ is the optimal arm.\n\nThe one-step expected regret of choosing an arm $i$ is defined as $r_i = \\mu^\\star - \\mu_i$.\nFor arm $1$, the regret is $r_1 = \\mu^\\star - \\mu_1 = 0.9 - 0.9 = 0$.\nFor arm $2$, the regret is $r_2 = \\mu^\\star - \\mu_2 = 0.9 - 0.5 = 0.4$.\n\nNext, we determine the arm selected by the entropy-seeking policy, $i_{\\mathrm{E}}$. This policy selects the arm $i$ that maximizes the predictive outcome entropy $H_i = - \\hat{p}_i \\ln \\hat{p}_i - (1 - \\hat{p}_i) \\ln(1 - \\hat{p}_i)$. The sample means are given as $\\hat{p}_1 = 0.9$ and $\\hat{p}_2 = 0.5$.\n\nFor arm $1$, the entropy is:\n$$ H_1 = -0.9 \\ln(0.9) - (1-0.9) \\ln(1-0.9) = -0.9 \\ln(0.9) - 0.1 \\ln(0.1) $$\nFor arm $2$, the entropy is:\n$$ H_2 = -0.5 \\ln(0.5) - (1-0.5) \\ln(1-0.5) = -0.5 \\ln(0.5) - 0.5 \\ln(0.5) = -\\ln(0.5) = \\ln(2) $$\nThe function $f(p) = -p\\ln p - (1-p)\\ln p$ represents the entropy of a Bernoulli trial. This function is maximized at $p=0.5$. Since $\\hat{p}_2 = 0.5$, $H_2$ has the maximum possible value for a Bernoulli random variable. Since $\\hat{p}_1 = 0.9 \\neq 0.5$, we must have $H_1 < H_2$.\nNumerically, $H_2 = \\ln(2) \\approx 0.6931$ nats, and $H_1 \\approx -0.9(-0.1054) - 0.1(-2.3026) = 0.0949 + 0.2303 = 0.3252$ nats.\nSince $H_2 > H_1$, the entropy-seeking policy chooses arm $2$. Therefore, $i_{\\mathrm{E}} = 2$.\n\nNow, we determine the arm selected by the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) policy, $i_{\\mathrm{U}}$. This policy selects the arm maximizing the index $\\mathrm{UCB}_i(t) = \\hat{p}_i + \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\ln t}{n_i}}$. The decision is made at time $t = 200$. The number of pulls for each arm is $n_1 = 100$ and $n_2 = 100$.\n\nFor arm $1$:\n$$ \\mathrm{UCB}_1(200) = \\hat{p}_1 + \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\ln(200)}{n_1}} = 0.9 + \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\ln(200)}{100}} = 0.9 + \\sqrt{\\frac{\\ln(200)}{50}} $$\nFor arm $2$:\n$$ \\mathrm{UCB}_2(200) = \\hat{p}_2 + \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\ln(200)}{n_2}} = 0.5 + \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\ln(200)}{100}} = 0.5 + \\sqrt{\\frac{\\ln(200)}{50}} $$\nThe exploration term, $\\sqrt{\\frac{\\ln(200)}{50}}$, is identical for both arms since $n_1 = n_2$. The decision is therefore determined by the exploitation term, $\\hat{p}_i$. Since $\\hat{p}_1 = 0.9 > \\hat{p}_2 = 0.5$, it follows that $\\mathrm{UCB}_1(200) > \\mathrm{UCB}_2(200)$.\nThe UCB policy chooses arm $1$. Therefore, $i_{\\mathrm{U}} = 1$.\n\nFinally, we compute the regret-information tradeoff ratio, $\\mathcal{T}$. The definition is:\n$$ \\mathcal{T} = \\frac{r_{i_{\\mathrm{E}}} - r_{i_{\\mathrm{U}}}}{H_{i_{\\mathrm{E}}} - H_{i_{\\mathrm{U}}}} $$\nWe substitute the values we have found:\n$i_{\\mathrm{E}} = 2$, so $r_{i_{\\mathrm{E}}} = r_2 = 0.4$ and $H_{i_{\\mathrm{E}}} = H_2 = \\ln(2)$.\n$i_{\\mathrm{U}} = 1$, so $r_{i_{\\mathrm{U}}} = r_1 = 0$ and $H_{i_{\\mathrm{U}}} = H_1 = -0.9 \\ln(0.9) - 0.1 \\ln(0.1)$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\mathcal{T}$:\n$$ \\mathcal{T} = \\frac{0.4 - 0}{\\ln(2) - (-0.9 \\ln(0.9) - 0.1 \\ln(0.1))} = \\frac{0.4}{\\ln(2) + 0.9 \\ln(0.9) + 0.1 \\ln(0.1)} $$\nWe now compute the numerical value.\nUsing the natural logarithm values:\n$\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693147$\n$\\ln(0.9) \\approx -0.105361$\n$\\ln(0.1) \\approx -2.302585$\n\nThe denominator is:\n$H_2 - H_1 \\approx 0.693147 + 0.9(-0.105361) + 0.1(-2.302585)$\n$H_2 - H_1 \\approx 0.693147 - 0.094825 - 0.230259 = 0.368063$\n\nSo, the ratio is:\n$$ \\mathcal{T} \\approx \\frac{0.4}{0.368063} \\approx 1.086766 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $1.087$.\nThe quantity $\\mathcal{T}$ represents the \"price\" of information, measured in units of expected regret per unit of entropy (in nats). In this specific instance, the entropy-seeking (exploration) policy incurs an excess regret of $0.4$ relative to the UCB policy, in order to gain an excess of approximately $0.368$ nats of information, resulting in the calculated ratio.",
