            "problem": "Consider the Abelian sandpile model (ASM) on a two-dimensional square lattice with open boundaries. Let the lattice be the $3 \\times 3$ grid with sites indexed by coordinates $(i,j) \\in \\{-1,0,1\\} \\times \\{-1,0,1\\}$, and let the origin be $(0,0)$. Each site $(i,j)$ carries an integer height $h(i,j) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}$. A site is unstable if its height is at least $4$. A toppling at site $(i,j)$ reduces $h(i,j)$ by $4$ and increases the height of each of its nearest neighbors (up to four of them in the interior, fewer on the boundary) by $1$. With open boundary conditions, any grains that would be sent to a neighbor outside the $3 \\times 3$ grid are dissipated and leave the system permanently.\n\nStart from the maximally stable initial configuration $h(i,j) = 3$ at all nine sites.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem within the domain of complex adaptive systems modeling, specifically the Abelian sandpile model (ASM).\n\nThe system is a $3 \\times 3$ grid of sites, indexed by coordinates $(i,j)$ where $i, j \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$. Each site $(i,j)$ has an integer height $h(i,j)$. A site is unstable if its height $h(i,j) \\ge 4$. A toppling at site $(i,j)$ results in the height changes:\n$h(i,j) \\to h(i,j) - 4$\n$h(\\text{neighbor}) \\to h(\\text{neighbor}) + 1$ for each neighbor inside the grid.\nThe system has open boundaries, so any grains that would go to a site outside the grid are lost.\n\nThe initial state is the maximally stable configuration, where all sites have a height of $3$. We can represent the height configuration as a matrix $H$, where the matrix indices $(r,c)$ with $r,c \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$ correspond to the grid coordinates $(c-2, 2-r)$.\nThe initial configuration $H_{init}$ is:\n$$ H_{init} = \\begin{pmatrix} 3  3  3 \\\\ 3  3  3 \\\\ 3  3  3 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThe process begins by adding a single grain to the origin, site $(0,0)$. This corresponds to the center of the grid. The height at $(0,0)$ becomes $3+1=4$. The configuration is now:\n$$ H_0 = \\begin{pmatrix} 3  3  3 \\\\ 3  4  3 \\\\ 3  3  3 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe site $(0,0)$ is now unstable. The stabilization process proceeds as a sequence of topplings. A key property of the ASM is that the final configuration and the total number of topplings are independent of the order in which unstable sites are toppled.\n\n**Step 1: First Toppling**\nThe only unstable site is $(0,0)$ with $h(0,0)=4$. We topple this site.\n- The height at $(0,0)$ decreases by $4$: $h(0,0) \\to 4-4=0$.\n- The heights of its four nearest neighbors, $(0,-1)$, $(0,1)$, $(-1,0)$, and $(1,0)$, each increase by $1$. Their heights become $3+1=4$.\nThe resulting configuration, $H_1$, is:\n$$ H_1 = \\begin{pmatrix} 3  4  3 \\\\ 4  0  4 \\\\ 3  4  3 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe number of topplings thus far is $1$.\n\n**Step 2: Second Round of Topplings**\nThe configuration $H_1$ has four unstable sites: the four edge sites $(0,-1)$, $(0,1)$, $(-1,0)$, and $(1,0)$, all with height $4$. We topple these four sites. The order does not matter. Let's analyze the collective effect of these four topplings.\n- Each of the four sites topples once. Their heights decrease by $4$: $h \\to 4-4=0$.\n- Site $(0,0)$: It is a neighbor to all four toppling sites. Its height increases by $4$: $h(0,0) \\to 0+4=4$.\n- The corner sites, $(\\pm 1, \\pm 1)$: Each corner site is a neighbor to two of the toppling edge sites. For instance, site $(-1,-1)$ is a neighbor to $(-1,0)$ and $(0,-1)$. Therefore, the height of each corner site increases by $2$: $h \\to 3+2=5$.\nThe resulting configuration, $H_2$, is:\n$$ H_2 = \\begin{pmatrix} 5  0  5 \\\\ 0  4  0 \\\\ 5  0  5 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe number of topplings in this round is $4$. The total number of topplings is now $1+4=5$.\n\n**Step 3: Final Round of Topplings**\nThe configuration $H_2$ has five unstable sites: the four corners with height $5$ and the center with height $4$. We proceed to topple these sites.\n1.  First, let's topple the center site $(0,0)$, which has $h(0,0)=4$.\n    - Its height becomes $h(0,0) \\to 4-4=0$.\n    - Its four neighbors, the edge sites, currently have height $0$. Their heights increase by $1$: $h \\to 0+1=1$.\n    This toppling is the $6^{th}$ total toppling. The configuration becomes:\n    $$ H_{2a} = \\begin{pmatrix} 5  1  5 \\\\ 1  0  1 \\\\ 5  1  5 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n2.  Now, the four corner sites $(\\pm 1, \\pm 1)$ are unstable with height $5$. We topple these four sites.\n    - Their heights decrease by $4$: $h \\to 5-4=1$.\n    - Each corner site has two neighbors on the grid. For example, toppling $(-1,-1)$ adds one grain to $(-1,0)$ and one to $(0,-1)$.\n    - Let's look at the effect on an edge site, say $(-1,0)$. Its current height is $1$. It receives one grain from the toppling of $(-1,-1)$ and one from $(-1,1)$. Its height becomes $1+2=3$.\n    - By symmetry, all four edge sites will have their heights change from $1$ to $3$.\nThis round involves $4$ more topplings, one for each corner. The final stabilized configuration, $H_f$, is:\n$$ H_f = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  3  1 \\\\ 3  0  3 \\\\ 1  3  1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nAll heights are now less than $4$, so the configuration is stable.\n\n**Summary of Topplings**\nTo find the total number of topplings, we sum the topplings from each stage:\n- Step 1: $1$ toppling at site $(0,0)$.\n- Step 2: $4$ topplings, one at each of the four edge sites.\n- Step 3: $1$ toppling at site $(0,0)$ and $4$ topplings, one at each of the four corner sites. This is a total of $5$ topplings.\n\nTotal number of topplings = $1 + 4 + 5 = 10$.\n\nThe final stabilized heights at all sites $(i,j)$ are:\n- $h(0,0) = 0$\n- $h(\\pm 1, 0) = h(0, \\pm 1) = 3$\n- $h(\\pm 1, \\pm 1) = 1$\n\nThe total number of topplings that occurred during the stabilization process is $10$.",

            "problem": "Consider a chip-firing model on a finite directed graph with a distinguished absorbing node (the sink) and deterministic local toppling rules. The Abelian Sandpile Model (ASM) on undirected graphs with fixed, configuration-independent redistribution vectors is known to have the Abelian property: addition-and-stabilization operators commute, i.e., for all sites $i$ and $j$, $a_i a_j = a_j a_i$, where $a_i$ denotes “add $1$ grain at site $i$ and then fully stabilize”. This commutativity arises from the linearity of the toppling operators and the least-action principle for stabilization.\n\nIn this problem, you are asked to constructively evaluate a specific counterexample in the class of directed, asymmetric, state-dependent toppling rules. The system consists of sites $\\{1,2\\}$ and a sink $s$. Heights are denoted by $h_1$ and $h_2$, and the sink never accumulates height in the state space (it only records absorbed grains). The system evolves under the following rules:\n\n- Thresholds: $\\theta_1 = 2$, $\\theta_2 = 2$. A site $i \\in \\{1,2\\}$ is unstable if $h_i \\ge \\theta_i$.\n- Toppling at site $2$: Whenever site $2$ topples, it sends $2$ grains directly to the sink $s$; equivalently, a toppling at site $2$ reduces $h_2$ by $2$ and increases the absorbed mass at $s$ by $2$.\n- Toppling at site $1$: Whenever site $1$ topples, it sends grains along outgoing directed edges according to a state-dependent, asymmetric rule:\n  - If, at the instant of toppling, $h_2$ is even, then site $1$ sends $2$ grains to site $2$ (and thus $h_1$ decreases by $2$, $h_2$ increases by $2$).\n  - If, at the instant of toppling, $h_2$ is odd, then site $1$ sends $1$ grain to site $2$ and $1$ grain to the sink $s$ (and thus $h_1$ decreases by $2$, $h_2$ increases by $1$, with $1$ grain absorbed at $s$).\n\nAssume the initial stable configuration is $(h_1,h_2)=(1,1)$, which is stable since $h_1  \\theta_1$ and $h_2  \\theta_2$. Define the addition-and-stabilization operator $a_i$ precisely as: add $1$ grain at site $i$ and then perform any legal sequence of topplings until all sites are stable, with each individual toppling obeying the rules above.\n\nWhich statement below is correct about the outcomes of $a_1 a_2$ versus $a_2 a_1$ applied to the initial configuration $(1,1)$, and why the Abelian property fails in this model?\n\nA. $a_1 a_2$ yields the final stable configuration $(0,1)$ while $a_2 a_1$ yields $(0,0)$; the Abelian property fails because the redistribution at site $1$ depends on the parity of $h_2$, making the local toppling operator nonlinear and order-dependent.\n\nB. Both $a_1 a_2$ and $a_2 a_1$ yield the same final stable configuration $(0,0)$; the Abelian property holds due to the presence of the sink ensuring uniqueness of stabilization.\n\nC. $a_1 a_2$ yields $(1,0)$ whereas $a_2 a_1$ yields $(0,1)$; the Abelian property fails solely because the graph is directed, even with configuration-independent linear toppling rules.\n\nD. Both $a_1 a_2$ and $a_2 a_1$ yield the same final stable configuration $(0,1)$; any differences arise only in transient toppling sequences, but final stabilized states are identical, so the Abelian property holds.",
