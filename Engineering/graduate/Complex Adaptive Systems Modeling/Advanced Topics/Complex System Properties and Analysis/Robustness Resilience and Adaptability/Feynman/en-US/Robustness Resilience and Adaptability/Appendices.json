Substituting this ansatz into the DDE yields:\n$$\n\\lambda C e^{\\lambda t} = a C e^{\\lambda t} + b C e^{\\lambda(t - \\tau)}\n$$\nDividing by $C e^{\\lambda t}$ (assuming $C \\neq 0$), we obtain the characteristic equation:\n$$\n\\lambda = a + b e^{-\\lambda \\tau}\n$$\nor\n$$\n\\lambda - a - b e^{-\\lambda \\tau} = 0\n$$\nThe equilibrium $x(t) \\equiv 0$ is asymptotically stable if and only if all roots $\\lambda$ of this transcendental equation have negative real parts, i.e., $\\text{Re}(\\lambda) < 0$. A loss of resilience (stability) occurs when at least one root or a pair of complex conjugate roots crosses the imaginary axis into the right half-plane as the delay parameter $\\tau$ is varied. The boundary of stability is therefore defined by roots with zero real part.\n\nWe investigate the existence of purely imaginary roots by setting $\\lambda = i\\omega$, where $\\omega$ is a real-valued frequency. Since the coefficients of the characteristic equation are real, if $i\\omega$ is a root, its complex conjugate $-i\\omega$ must also be a root. We can assume $\\omega \\ge 0$ without loss of generality.

Our condition $\\sin(\\omega\\tau) = -\\omega/b$ with $\\omega>0$ and $b<0$ also dictates a positive sine.

With these choices, the ODE becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{d\\tau} = r + \\text{sign}(a) y^2\n$$\nBy possibly redefining $y \\to -y$, we can absorb the sign of the quadratic term. A more common convention is to absorb signs into the parameter $r$ and variable $y$. For instance, picking scaling factors such that $a c_1 c_3 = 1$ and $\\frac{b c_2 c_3}{c_1} = \\text{sign}(b)$ leads to $\\dot{y} = \\text{sign}(b)r+y^2$. All these forms are qualitatively identical and differ only by trivial transformations. The most general statement is that the dynamics are locally equivalent to\n$$\n\\dot{y} = r \\pm y^2\n$$\nThis is the normal form of the saddle-node bifurcation.\n\n**Part (ii): Analysis of a Concrete System**\n\nWe are given the specific adaptive dynamics:\n$$\n\\dot{x} = \\mu - x + x^2\n$$\nIn this case, the function is $f(x, \\mu) = x^2 - x + \\mu$.\n\nFirst, we find the equilibrium points by setting $\\dot{x} = 0$:\n$$\nx^2 - x + \\mu = 0\n$$\nUsing the quadratic formula, the equilibrium solutions $x_{eq}$ are:\n$$\nx_{eq} = \\frac{-(-1) \\pm \\sqrt{(-1)^2 - 4(1)(\\mu)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 - 4\\mu}}{2}\n$$\nThe nature of the equilibria depends on the discriminant, $\\Delta = 1 - 4\\mu$:\n- If $\\Delta > 0$ (i.e., $\\mu < \\frac{1}{4}$), there are two distinct real equilibria.\n- If $\\Delta = 0$ (i.e., $\\mu = \\frac{1}{4}$), there is one real equilibrium where the two have coalesced.\n- If $\\Delta < 0$ (i.e., $\\mu > \\frac{1}{4}$), there are no real equilibria.\n\nThe coalescence of equilibria is the signature of a saddle-node bifurcation. This occurs at the parameter value $\\mu^{\\ast}$ where the discriminant is zero.\n$$\n1 - 4\\mu^{\\ast} = 0 \\implies \\mu^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\nAt this parameter value, the single equilibrium is:\n$$\nx^{\\ast} = \\frac{1 \\pm 0}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThe bifurcation point is therefore $(x^{\\ast}, \\mu^{\\ast}) = (\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{4})$.\n\nWe must now verify that the four conditions for a saddle-node bifurcation hold at this point.\n1. $f(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{4}) = (\\frac{1}{2})^2 - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = 0$. The condition is met.\n2. The partial derivative with respect to $x$ is $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2x - 1$. At the point, $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{4}) = 2(\\frac{1}{2}) - 1 = 0$. The condition is met.\n3. The second partial derivative is $\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2} = 2$. At the point, $\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial x^2}(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{4}) = 2 \\neq 0$. The condition is met.\n4. The partial derivative with respect to $\\mu$ is $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\mu} = 1$. At the point, $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\mu}(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{4}) = 1 \\neq 0$. The condition is met.\nSince all four conditions are satisfied, a saddle-node bifurcation occurs at $(x^{\\ast}, \\mu^{\\ast}) = (\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{4})$.\n\nFinally, we need to determine where resilience collapses. Resilience is associated with the stable equilibrium. The stability of an equilibrium $x_{eq}$ is determined by the sign of $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}(x_{eq})$. An equilibrium is stable if $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} < 0$ and unstable if $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} > 0$.\nThe two equilibria for $\\mu < \\frac{1}{4}$ are $x_1 = \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{1 - 4\\mu}}{2}$ and $x_2 = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{1 - 4\\mu}}{2}$.\nLet's evaluate the stability derivative, $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 2x - 1$, at each equilibrium.\n- For $x_1$: $2x_1 - 1 = 2(\\frac{1 - \\sqrt{1 - 4\\mu}}{2}) - 1 = 1 - \\sqrt{1 - 4\\mu} - 1 = -\\sqrt{1 - 4\\mu}$. For $\\mu < \\frac{1}{4}$, this value is negative, so $x_1$ is a stable equilibrium.\n- For $x_2$: $2x_2 - 1 = 2(\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{1 - 4\\mu}}{2}) - 1 = 1 + \\sqrt{1 - 4\\mu} - 1 = \\sqrt{1 - 4\\mu}$. For $\\mu < \\frac{1}{4}$, this value is positive, so $x_2$ is an unstable equilibrium.\n\nThe system's resilience is embodied by the stable equilibrium $x_1$. As the stress parameter $\\mu$ increases towards $\\frac{1}{4}$, this stable equilibrium and the unstable equilibrium $x_2$ approach each other, finally colliding and annihilating at $\\mu = \\frac{1}{4}$. For any $\\mu > \\frac{1}{4}$, no equilibria exist, and trajectories grow unbounded (in this model, to $+\\infty$). The collapse of resilience, defined as the disappearance of the stable attracting equilibrium, therefore occurs precisely at the bifurcation point.\n\nThe critical parameter value $\\mu_c$ is the value of $\\mu$ at which the stable equilibrium disappears. This is the bifurcation value.\nTherefore, $\\mu_c = \\mu^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{4}$.",
