            "problem": "Consider a single-agent decision process governed by Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) on a directed graph with nodes $S$ (start), $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$, and $G$ (goal). At each time step, an agent located at node $i$ chooses one outgoing edge $(i,j)$ with probability proportional to the product of pheromone intensity and heuristic desirability. Specifically, the selection propensity for edge $(i,j)$ is proportional to $\\tau_{ij}^{\\alpha}\\eta_{ij}^{\\beta}$, where $\\tau_{ij} \\gt 0$ is the pheromone intensity, $\\eta_{ij} \\gt 0$ is the heuristic desirability, $\\alpha \\gt 0$ modulates pheromone influence, and $\\beta \\gt 0$ modulates heuristic influence. The decision rule is normalized over all feasible outgoing edges at each node.\n\nThe directed edges and their parameters are as follows:\n- From $S$: $(S,A)$ with $\\tau_{SA}=2$, $\\eta_{SA}=4$; $(S,B)$ with $\\tau_{SB}=1$, $\\eta_{SB}=9$; $(S,C)$ with $\\tau_{SC}=3$, $\\eta_{SC}=1$.\n- From $A$: $(A,G)$ with $\\tau_{AG}=3$, $\\eta_{AG}=2$; $(A,D)$ with $\\tau_{AD}=2$, $\\eta_{AD}=1$.\n- From $B$: $(B,G)$ with $\\tau_{BG}=4$, $\\eta_{BG}=1$; $(B,E)$ with $\\tau_{BE}=1$, $\\eta_{BE}=5$.\n\nAssume the agent starts at $S$, makes exactly $2$ moves, and there is no pheromone update during these moves (parameters remain static).

All necessary parameters and definitions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions.\n\nThe core of the ACO decision-making process is the probabilistic selection of a path. The probability $P_{ij}$ for an agent at node $i$ to choose the next node $j$ from the set of feasible neighbors $N(i)$ is given by:\n$$\nP_{ij} = \\frac{\\tau_{ij}^{\\alpha} \\eta_{ij}^{\\beta}}{\\sum_{k \\in N(i)} \\tau_{ik}^{\\alpha} \\eta_{ik}^{\\beta}}\n$$\nwhere $\\tau_{ij}$ is the pheromone intensity on edge $(i,j)$, $\\eta_{ij}$ is the heuristic desirability of that edge, and $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are parameters that control the relative influence of pheromone and heuristic information, respectively.\n\nLet's define the selection propensity, or unnormalized probability, for moving along edge $(i,j)$ as $v_{ij} = \\tau_{ij}^{\\alpha} \\eta_{ij}^{\\beta}$. The problem specifies $\\alpha=2$ and $\\beta=1$. Therefore, the propensity is $v_{ij} = \\tau_{ij}^{2} \\eta_{ij}$.\n\nThe first task is to compute the one-step transition probabilities. This requires calculating the propensities for all relevant edges.\n\nFor outgoing edges from the start node $S$:\nThe neighbors of $S$ are $A$, $B$, and $C$.\nThe propensity for edge $(S,A)$ is $v_{SA} = \\tau_{SA}^{2} \\eta_{SA} = 2^{2} \\times 4 = 4 \\times 4 = 16$.\nThe propensity for edge $(S,B)$ is $v_{SB} = \\tau_{SB}^{2} \\eta_{SB} = 1^{2} \\times 9 = 1 \\times 9 = 9$.\nThe propensity for edge $(S,C)$ is $v_{SC} = \\tau_{SC}^{2} \\eta_{SC} = 3^{2} \\times 1 = 9 \\times 1 = 9$.\nThe sum of propensities for all outgoing edges from $S$ is $\\sum_{k \\in \\{A,B,C\\}} v_{Sk} = v_{SA} + v_{SB} + v_{SC} = 16 + 9 + 9 = 34$.\nThe normalized transition probabilities from $S$ are:\n$P(A|S) = \\frac{v_{SA}}{\\sum v_{Sk}} = \\frac{16}{34} = \\frac{8}{17}$.\n$P(B|S) = \\frac{v_{SB}}{\\sum v_{Sk}} = \\frac{9}{34}$.\n\nFor outgoing edges from node $A$:\nThe neighbors of $A$ are $G$ and $D$.\nThe propensity for edge $(A,G)$ is $v_{AG} = \\tau_{AG}^{2} \\eta_{AG} = 3^{2} \\times 2 = 9 \\times 2 = 18$.\nThe propensity for edge $(A,D)$ is $v_{AD} = \\tau_{AD}^{2} \\eta_{AD} = 2^{2} \\times 1 = 4 \\times 1 = 4$.\nThe sum of propensities for all outgoing edges from $A$ is $\\sum_{k \\in \\{G,D\\}} v_{Ak} = v_{AG} + v_{AD} = 18 + 4 = 22$.\nThe normalized transition probability from $A$ to $G$ is:\n$P(G|A) = \\frac{v_{AG}}{\\sum v_{Ak}} = \\frac{18}{22} = \\frac{9}{11}$.\n\nFor outgoing edges from node $B$:\nThe neighbors of $B$ are $G$ and $E$.\nThe propensity for edge $(B,G)$ is $v_{BG} = \\tau_{BG}^{2} \\eta_{BG} = 4^{2} \\times 1 = 16 \\times 1 = 16$.\nThe propensity for edge $(B,E)$ is $v_{BE} = \\tau_{BE}^{2} \\eta_{BE} = 1^{2} \\times 5 = 1 \\times 5 = 5$.\nThe sum of propensities for all outgoing edges from $B$ is $\\sum_{k \\in \\{G,E\\}} v_{Bk} = v_{BG} + v_{BE} = 16 + 5 = 21$.\nThe normalized transition probability from $B$ to $G$ is:\n$P(G|B) = \\frac{v_{BG}}{\\sum v_{Bk}} = \\frac{16}{21}$.\n\nThe next task is to compute the two-step path probabilities for reaching the goal node $G$. Since the problem states that pheromone levels are static, the decision at each step is independent of the previous one, conditioned on the current node. The probability of traversing a path is the product of the transition probabilities of its constituent edges.\n\nThe probability of the path $S \\to A \\to G$ is:\n$P(S \\to A \\to G) = P(A|S) \\times P(G|A) = \\frac{8}{17} \\times \\frac{9}{11} = \\frac{72}{187}$.\n\nThe probability of the path $S \\to B \\to G$ is:\n$P(S \\to B \\to G) = P(B|S) \\times P(G|B) = \\frac{9}{34} \\times \\frac{16}{21}$.\nTo simplify this fraction:\n$P(S \\to B \\to G) = \\frac{9 \\times 16}{34 \\times 21} = \\frac{(3 \\times 3) \\times 16}{(2 \\times 17) \\times (3 \\times 7)} = \\frac{3 \\times 16}{2 \\times 17 \\times 7} = \\frac{3 \\times 8}{17 \\times 7} = \\frac{24}{119}$.\n\nFinally, the problem defines the expected path bias as the natural logarithm of the ratio of these two path probabilities. Let this bias be denoted by $\\mathcal{B}$.\n$$\n\\mathcal{B} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{P(S \\to A \\to G)}{P(S \\to B \\to G)}\\right)\n$$\nWe compute the ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{P(S \\to A \\to G)}{P(S \\to B \\to G)} = \\frac{\\frac{72}{187}}{\\frac{24}{119}} = \\frac{72}{187} \\times \\frac{119}{24}\n$$\nWe can simplify this expression.

Eigenvalues and Spectral Radius**\n\nThe Jacobian matrix has the symmetric form $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ b & a \\end{pmatrix}$, with $a = 1-\\rho + \\frac{\\alpha\\rho}{2}$ and $b = -\\frac{\\alpha\\rho}{2}$. The eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of such a matrix are $\\lambda_1 = a+b$ and $\\lambda_2 = a-b$.\n\nWe compute these eigenvalues:\n$$\n\\lambda_1 = a+b = \\left(1-\\rho + \\frac{\\alpha\\rho}{2}\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{\\alpha\\rho}{2}\\right) = 1-\\rho\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda_2 = a-b = \\left(1-\\rho + \\frac{\\alpha\\rho}{2}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{\\alpha\\rho}{2}\\right) = 1-\\rho + \\alpha\\rho\n$$\nThe eigenvalues of the Jacobian at the symmetric fixed point are $\\lambda_1 = 1-\\rho$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1-\\rho + \\alpha\\rho$.\n\nThe spectral radius, $\\rho(J)$, is the maximum of the absolute values of the eigenvalues:\n$$\n\\rho(J) = \\max(|\\lambda_1|, |\\lambda_2|) = \\max(|1-\\rho|, |1-\\rho + \\alpha\\rho|)\n$$\nWe analyze these values under the given constraints $\\rho \\in (0,1)$ and $\\alpha > 0$.\nSince $\\rho \\in (0,1)$, it follows that $0 < 1-\\rho < 1$, so $|1-\\rho| = 1-\\rho$.\nSince $\\alpha > 0$ and $\\rho > 0$, the product $\\alpha\\rho$ is strictly positive. Therefore, $1-\\rho + \\alpha\\rho > 1-\\rho$.\nGiven that $1-\\rho$ is positive, $1-\\rho + \\alpha\\rho$ must also be positive. Thus, $|1-\\rho + \\alpha\\rho| = 1-\\rho + \\alpha\\rho$.\nComparing the two positive eigenvalues, we have:\n$$\n1-\\rho + \\alpha\\rho > 1-\\rho\n$$\nThe maximum of their absolute values is therefore $|1-\\rho + \\alpha\\rho|$.\n$$\n\\rho(J) = 1-\\rho + \\alpha\\rho\n$$\nThis expression provides the spectral radius as a function of only $\\rho$ and $\\alpha$. The symmetric fixed point becomes unstable when $\\rho(J) > 1$, which occurs if $1-\\rho + \\alpha\\rho > 1$, simplifying to $\\alpha\\rho > \\rho$, or $\\alpha > 1$. This is a classic result in the analysis of ACO dynamics concerning symmetry breaking.",
