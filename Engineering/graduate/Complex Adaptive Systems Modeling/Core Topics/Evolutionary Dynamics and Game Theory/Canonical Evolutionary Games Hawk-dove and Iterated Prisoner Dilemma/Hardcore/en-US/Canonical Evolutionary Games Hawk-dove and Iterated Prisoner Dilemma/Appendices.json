            "problem": "Consider a symmetric two-strategy evolutionary game representing the canonical Hawk–Dove interaction over a shared resource of value $V$ with a costly conflict of cost $C$. The strategies are Hawk ($H$) and Dove ($D$). The payoffs per encounter are specified as follows: when two Hawks meet, each receives $\\frac{V - C}{2}$; when a Hawk meets a Dove, the Hawk receives $V$ and the Dove receives $0$; when two Doves meet, each receives $\\frac{V}{2}$. Let $p \\in [0,1]$ denote the fraction of Hawks in a large, well-mixed population under random matching.\n\nStarting from the standard definition of expected payoff and the definition of an Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS), derive the mixed ESS frequency $p^{\\ast}$ of Hawks for $V = 1$ and $C = 2$ and verify its local stability under the replicator dynamics $\\,\\dot{p} = p(1 - p)\\big(\\pi_{H}(p) - \\pi_{D}(p)\\big)$, where $\\pi_{H}(p)$ and $\\pi_{D}(p)$ are the expected payoffs to Hawks and Doves when the population has Hawk frequency $p$.

No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is a standard, well-posed problem in evolutionary game theory, based on established scientific principles. All necessary information is provided, and the terms are defined unambiguously.\n\nFirst, we formalize the problem by constructing the payoff matrix. Let the player choosing the strategy in the row be the focal individual, and the player choosing the strategy in the column be the opponent. The strategies are Hawk ($H$) and Dove ($D$). The payoff matrix $A$ is given by:\n$$ A = \\begin{pmatrix} \\pi(H,H)  \\pi(H,D) \\\\ \\pi(D,H)  \\pi(D,D) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{V - C}{2}  V \\\\ 0  \\frac{V}{2} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nHere, $\\pi(i,j)$ is the payoff to an individual playing strategy $i$ against an opponent playing strategy $j$. The value of the resource is $V$ and the cost of conflict is $C$.\n\nLet $p$ be the frequency of the Hawk strategy in the population. The frequency of the Dove strategy is then $1-p$. In a large, well-mixed population with random matching, the expected payoff for a Hawk, $\\pi_{H}(p)$, and for a Dove, $\\pi_{D}(p)$, can be calculated as follows:\n$$ \\pi_{H}(p) = p \\cdot \\pi(H,H) + (1-p) \\cdot \\pi(H,D) = p\\left(\\frac{V - C}{2}\\right) + (1-p)V $$\n$$ \\pi_{D}(p) = p \\cdot \\pi(D,H) + (1-p) \\cdot \\pi(D,D) = p(0) + (1-p)\\frac{V}{2} $$\n\nAn Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS) is a strategy that, if adopted by a population, cannot be invaded by any alternative strategy that is initially rare. A mixed ESS, denoted by a frequency $p^{\\ast} \\in (0,1)$, occurs when the expected payoffs of the pure strategies are equal. This equality means that there is no selective advantage for either strategy at this specific frequency.\n$$ \\pi_{H}(p^{\\ast}) = \\pi_{D}(p^{\\ast}) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the expected payoffs:\n$$ p^{\\ast}\\left(\\frac{V - C}{2}\\right) + (1-p^{\\ast})V = (1-p^{\\ast})\\frac{V}{2} $$\nWe solve for $p^{\\ast}$:\n$$ \\frac{p^{\\ast}V}{2} - \\frac{p^{\\ast}C}{2} + V - p^{\\ast}V = \\frac{V}{2} - \\frac{p^{\\ast}V}{2} $$\nTo isolate terms with $p^{\\ast}$, we move them to one side of the equation:\n$$ \\frac{p^{\\ast}V}{2} - \\frac{p^{\\ast}C}{2} - p^{\\ast}V + \\frac{p^{\\ast}V}{2} = \\frac{V}{2} - V $$\n$$ p^{\\ast}\\left(\\frac{V}{2} - \\frac{C}{2} - V + \\frac{V}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{V}{2} $$\n$$ p^{\\ast}\\left(-\\frac{C}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{V}{2} $$\n$$ p^{\\ast} = \\frac{V}{C} $$\nThis mixed equilibrium exists only if $0  p^{\\ast}  1$, which requires $V  C$ (assuming $V  0$ and $C  0$). The problem provides the values $V=1$ and $C=2$. Since $1  2$, a mixed ESS exists.\nFor $V=1$ and $C=2$, the mixed ESS frequency of Hawks is:\n$$ p^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\n\nNext, we verify the local stability of this equilibrium under the replicator dynamics, given by $\\dot{p} = p(1 - p)\\big(\\pi_{H}(p) - \\pi_{D}(p)\\big)$. Let $f(p) = \\pi_{H}(p) - \\pi_{D}(p)$. The local stability of an interior fixed point $p^{\\ast}$ is determined by the derivative of the growth rate function $\\frac{\\dot{p}}{p}$ or more simply, the derivative of the payoff difference function $f(p)$. An interior fixed point $p^{\\ast}$ is stable if $f'(p^{\\ast})  0$.\nLet's compute $f(p)$:\n$$ f(p) = \\left[ p\\left(\\frac{V - C}{2}\\right) + (1-p)V \\right] - \\left[ (1-p)\\frac{V}{2} \\right] $$\n$$ f(p) = p\\left(\\frac{V-C}{2} - V + \\frac{V}{2}\\right) + V - \\frac{V}{2} $$\n$$ f(p) = p\\left(-\\frac{C}{2}\\right) + \\frac{V}{2} $$\nThe derivative of $f(p)$ with respect to $p$ is:\n$$ f'(p) = \\frac{d}{dp}\\left(\\frac{V}{2} - \\frac{C}{2}p\\right) = -\\frac{C}{2} $$\nFor stability, we require $f'(p^{\\ast})  0$. Since $f'(p)$ is the constant $-\\frac{C}{2}$, and the cost of conflict $C=2$ is positive, we have:\n$$ f'(p^{\\ast}) = -\\frac{2}{2} = -1  0 $$\nThe condition is satisfied, so the mixed equilibrium $p^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}$ is locally stable.\n\nNow, we compute the average population payoff, $\\bar{\\pi}(p^{\\ast})$, at this equilibrium. The average payoff is the weighted average of the payoffs of a Hawk and a Dove:\n$$ \\bar{\\pi}(p) = p \\cdot \\pi_{H}(p) + (1-p) \\cdot \\pi_{D}(p) $$\nAt the mixed equilibrium $p^{\\ast}$, by definition, $\\pi_{H}(p^{\\ast}) = \\pi_{D}(p^{\\ast})$. Therefore, the average payoff simplifies to the payoff of either strategy at this frequency:\n$$ \\bar{\\pi}(p^{\\ast}) = \\pi_{D}(p^{\\ast}) = (1-p^{\\ast})\\frac{V}{2} $$\nSubstituting $p^{\\ast} = V/C$:\n$$ \\bar{\\pi}(p^{\\ast}) = \\left(1 - \\frac{V}{C}\\right)\\frac{V}{2} = \\frac{C-V}{C}\\frac{V}{2} = \\frac{V(C-V)}{2C} $$\nUsing the given values $V=1$ and $C=2$:\n$$ \\bar{\\pi}(p^{\\ast}) = \\frac{1(2-1)}{2(2)} = \\frac{1}{4} $$\nThe requested numerical outputs are $p^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\bar{\\pi}(p^{\\ast}) = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n\nFinally, a brief biological interpretation. The equilibrium frequency of aggressive individuals (Hawks), $p^{\\ast} = V/C$, is determined by the ratio of the resource value to the conflict cost. This signifies that evolution selects for a balance between aggression and passivity, where the proportion of aggressive behavior is tuned by the environment's specific costs and benefits. When the resource is more valuable ($V$ increases) or conflict is less costly ($C$ decreases), aggression becomes more prevalent.\nThe average population payoff at this equilibrium, $\\bar{\\pi}(p^{\\ast}) = \\frac{V(C-V)}{2C}$, represents the average fitness of an individual. It is noteworthy that this payoff is less than the payoff a population of all Doves would achieve, which is $\\frac{V}{2}$. For our values, $\\bar{\\pi}(p^{\\ast}) = \\frac{1}{4}$ while the all-Dove payoff would be $\\frac{1}{2}$. This illustrates a tragedy of the commons: individually advantageous strategies (being a Hawk when Doves are common) lead to a collectively suboptimal outcome. The pure-Dove state is not evolutionarily stable because it is vulnerable to invasion by Hawks. Selection, acting at the individual level, drives the population to a state where costly conflicts are unavoidable, reducing the overall \"efficiency\" or average fitness of the population compared to a hypothetical cooperative ideal.",

            "problem": "Consider the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma (IPD) played between members of a well-mixed population. Each round is repeated with continuation probability $w \\in (0,1)$ and per-round payoffs are given by $(T,R,P,S)$, where $TRPS$ and actions are observed perfectly. Use the normalized discounted payoff definition $(1-w)\\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} w^{t} \\pi_{t}$, where $\\pi_{t}$ is the stage payoff at round $t$. Two strategies are present: Win-Stay Lose-Shift (WSLS) and Always Defect (ALLD). Win-Stay Lose-Shift (WSLS) cooperates after an outcome it evaluates as a “win” (receiving either $R$ or $T$) and defects after an outcome it evaluates as a “loss” (receiving either $P$ or $S$).

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem within the domain of evolutionary game theory. It provides a complete and consistent set of definitions and conditions to derive the requested quantity.\n\nWe are tasked with finding the minimal continuation probability $w$ for which a monomorphic population of Win-Stay Lose-Shift (WSLS) players is evolutionarily stable against invasion by rare Always Defect (ALLD) mutants. Stability requires that the payoff of a typical resident player strictly exceeds the payoff of a rare mutant. The normalized discounted payoff is defined as $U = (1-w)\\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} w^{t} \\pi_{t}$, where $\\pi_t$ is the payoff in round $t$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the payoff of a resident WSLS player interacting with another WSLS player, denoted as $U_{WSLS, WSLS}$. The problem states that the resident population starts in mutual cooperation.\nIn round $t=0$, both WSLS players cooperate (C). The outcome is (C, C), and both receive the reward payoff $R$.\nThe WSLS strategy is to cooperate after receiving a \"win\" (payoff $R$ or $T$) and defect after receiving a \"loss\" (payoff $P$ or $S$).\nSince both players received $R$ in round $t=0$, which is a \"win\", they will both \"stay\" with their previous action (C) in round $t=1$.\nThis leads to a perpetual sequence of mutual cooperation (C, C) in every round. The payoff stream for a WSLS player in this interaction is thus $(R, R, R, \\dots)$.\nThe normalized discounted payoff is:\n$$U_{WSLS, WSLS} = (1-w) \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} w^{t} R = (1-w) R \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} w^{t}$$\nThe sum of the infinite geometric series is $\\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} w^t = \\frac{1}{1-w}$ for $w \\in (0,1)$.\n$$U_{WSLS, WSLS} = (1-w) R \\left( \\frac{1}{1-w} \\right) = R$$\n\nNext, we calculate the payoff of a rare ALLD mutant interacting with a resident WSLS player, denoted as $U_{ALLD, WSLS}$. Let the ALLD player be Player 1 and the WSLS player be Player 2.\nIn round $t=0$:\n-   Player 1 (ALLD) defects (D) by definition.\n-   Player 2 (WSLS), being a resident from a cooperating population, starts by cooperating (C).\n-   The actions are (D, C). The payoffs are $(T, S)$. The ALLD mutant receives $T$.\n\nIn round $t=1$:\n-   Player 1 (ALLD) defects (D).\n-   Player 2 (WSLS) received payoff $S$ in the previous round. This is a \"loss\", so it follows the \"Lose-Shift\" rule. Its previous action was C, so it shifts to D.\n-   The actions are (D, D). The payoffs are $(P, P)$. The ALLD mutant receives $P$.\n\nIn round $t=2$:\n-   Player 1 (ALLD) defects (D).\n-   Player 2 (WSLS) received payoff $P$ in the previous round. This is a \"loss\", so it shifts again. Its previous action was D, so it shifts to C.\n-   The actions are (D, C). The payoffs are $(T, S)$. The ALLD mutant receives $T$.\n\nIn round $t=3$:\n-   Player 1 (ALLD) defects (D).\n-   Player 2 (WSLS) received payoff $S$ in the previous round (\"loss\"), so it shifts from C to D.\n-   The actions are (D, D). The payoffs are $(P, P)$. The ALLD mutant receives $P$.\n\nThe sequence of payoffs for the ALLD mutant is $(T, P, T, P, \\dots)$. We can now compute its normalized discounted payoff:\n$$U_{ALLD, WSLS} = (1-w) \\left( T \\cdot w^0 + P \\cdot w^1 + T \\cdot w^2 + P \\cdot w^3 + \\dots \\right)$$\n$$U_{ALLD, WSLS} = (1-w) \\left( (T + T w^2 + T w^4 + \\dots) + (P w + P w^3 + P w^5 + \\dots) \\right)$$\n$$U_{ALLD, WSLS} = (1-w) \\left( T \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (w^2)^k + wP \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (w^2)^k \\right)$$\nThe geometric series sum is $\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} (w^2)^k = \\frac{1}{1-w^2}$.\n$$U_{ALLD, WSLS} = (1-w) \\left( \\frac{T}{1-w^2} + \\frac{wP}{1-w^2} \\right) = (1-w) \\frac{T+wP}{1-w^2}$$\nUsing the identity $1-w^2 = (1-w)(1+w)$, we simplify the expression:\n$$U_{ALLD, WSLS} = \\frac{(1-w)(T+wP)}{(1-w)(1+w)} = \\frac{T+wP}{1+w}$$\n\nThe condition for the WSLS population to be stable against invasion by ALLD is that the resident's payoff is strictly greater than the mutant's payoff:\n$$U_{WSLS, WSLS}  U_{ALLD, WSLS}$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions:\n$$R  \\frac{T+wP}{1+w}$$\nSince $w \\in (0,1)$, the term $(1+w)$ is positive. We can multiply both sides by it without changing the direction of the inequality:\n$$R(1+w)  T+wP$$\n$$R + wR  T + wP$$\nTo solve for $w$, we gather terms containing $w$:\n$$wR - wP  T - R$$\n$$w(R-P)  T-R$$\nThe problem specifies the payoff ordering $TRPS$, which implies that both $(R-P)$ and $(T-R)$ are positive quantities. Therefore, we can divide by $(R-P)$ without changing the inequality's direction:\n$$w  \\frac{T-R}{R-P}$$\nThis inequality defines the condition on the continuation probability $w$ for the WSLS strategy to be robust against invasion by ALLD. The minimal value of $w$ that satisfies this strict inequality is the threshold value itself. Thus, the minimal continuation probability is the expression on the right-hand side.\n\nRegarding the qualitative effect of implementation errors, the error-correction property of WSLS is crucial. When two WSLS players interact, a single-shot error (e.g., an intended C becomes a D) disrupts cooperation for only two rounds before mutual cooperation is restored. This means the resident-resident payoff, $U_{WSLS, WSLS}$, degrades gracefully and remains high for small error rates $\\epsilon$. In contrast, strategies without this feature (e.g., Grim Trigger) would suffer a catastrophic collapse to permanent mutual defection from a single error, causing their resident-resident payoff to plummet. While the introduction of noise may slightly increase the minimal $w$ required to maintain stability for WSLS (as the resident payoff is slightly reduced), its inherent robustness ensures this threshold remains low. For less forgiving strategies, the threshold would increase dramatically, making them non-viable in noisy environments. Therefore, the error-correction property makes WSLS a far more robust strategy by keeping the minimal continuation probability required for stability low, relative to strategies that do not correct errors quickly.",

Interactions are pairwise and random among distinct individuals, and the average payoff to each type is computed by averaging over the distribution of opponents in the current population state. Let the benefit of the resource be $V$ and the cost of conflict be $C$. The Hawk–Dove payoff matrix is defined as follows: when two Hawks interact, each receives $(V-C)/2$; when a Hawk meets a Dove, the Hawk receives $V$ and the Dove receives $0$; when two Doves interact, each receives $V/2$.

So, $\\rho_k - \\rho_{k-1} = \\rho_1 \\prod_{j=1}^{k-1} \\gamma_j$.\nTo find $\\rho_i$, we sum the differences:\n$$ \\rho_i = \\sum_{k=1}^{i} (\\rho_k - \\rho_{k-1}) = \\rho_1 \\sum_{k=1}^{i} \\prod_{j=1}^{k-1} \\gamma_j $$\nUsing the convention that an empty product $\\prod_{j=1}^0$ is $1$.\nTo find $\\rho_1$, we apply the boundary condition $\\rho_N=1$:\n$$ 1 = \\rho_N = \\rho_1 \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\prod_{j=1}^{k-1} \\gamma_j $$\nSolving for $\\rho_1$, the fixation probability of a single Hawk mutant, we get:\n$$ \\rho = \\rho_1 = \\frac{1}{\\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\prod_{j=1}^{k-1} \\gamma_j} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\sum_{k=2}^{N} \\prod_{j=1}^{k-1} \\gamma_j} $$\nA more standard form is:\n$$ \\rho = \\frac{1}{1 + \\sum_{k=1}^{N-1} \\prod_{j=1}^{k} \\gamma_j} $$\nTo implement this, we need the expression for $\\gamma_j$:\n$$ \\pi_D(j) - \\pi_H(j) = \\frac{1}{N-1} \\left[ \\frac{V(N-j-1)}{2} - \\left( \\frac{V-C}{2}(j-1) + V(N-j) \\right) \\right] $$\n$$ = \\frac{1}{2(N-1)} [V(N-j-1) - (V-C)(j-1) - 2V(N-j)] $$\n$$ = \\frac{1}{2(N-1)} [VN-Vj-V - (Vj-V-Cj+C) - 2VN+2Vj] = \\frac{C(j-1) - VN}{2(N-1)} $$\nThus,\n$$ \\gamma_j = \\exp\\left( \\beta \\frac{C(j-1) - VN}{2(N-1)} \\right) $$\nThis expression for $\\gamma_j$ will be used in the summation to calculate $\\rho$.\n\nFor the neutral case, $\\beta=0$, which implies $\\gamma_j = \\exp(0) = 1$ for all $j$. The fixation probability becomes:\n$$ \\rho = \\frac{1}{1 + \\sum_{k=1}^{N-1} \\prod_{j=1}^{k} 1} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\sum_{k=1}^{N-1} 1} = \\frac{1}{1 + (N-1)} = \\frac{1}{N} $$\nThis confirms the result for neutral drift.\n\nThe computational procedure is to calculate $\\rho$ using the derived formula for each set of parameters $(N, V, C, \\beta)$. Then, compare the calculated $\\rho$ with the neutral probability $1/N$ to determine $\\Delta \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ based on the specified tolerance of $10^{-12}$.",
