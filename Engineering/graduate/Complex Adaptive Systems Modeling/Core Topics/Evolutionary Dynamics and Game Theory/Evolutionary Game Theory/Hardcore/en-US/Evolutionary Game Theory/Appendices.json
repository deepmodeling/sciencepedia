This exercise provides fundamental practice in translating a descriptive biological scenario into a formal payoff matrix. By calculating the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS), you will determine the precise conditions under which both aggressive (Hawk) and passive (Dove) strategies can coexist in a stable equilibrium, a key insight into the evolution of behavior .",

            "problem": "Consider a large, well-mixed population in which individuals engage in pairwise contests over a single resource of value $V0$. Each individual expresses one of two heritable strategies: Hawk or Dove. The contest proceeds according to the following biologically grounded rules:\n- When two Hawks meet, they fight; each individual has probability $1/2$ of winning the resource and probability $1/2$ of losing and incurring an injury cost $C0$ associated with the contest.\n- When a Hawk meets a Dove, the Hawk immediately claims the resource and the Dove retreats without injury.\n- When two Doves meet, they engage in a low-cost display and share the resource without fighting.\n\nAssume payoffs are additive over encounters and proportional to expected reproductive success. Let $p\\in[0,1]$ denote the frequency of Hawks in the population, and suppose individuals are randomly matched. Use the formal definition of an Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS): for a symmetric game, a resident strategy $p^{*}$ is evolutionarily stable if it cannot be invaded by any sufficiently rare mutant strategy, meaning that when the population is mostly at $p^{*}$, any mutant obtains no higher expected payoff than the resident mixture, with strict inequality when equalities hold at leading order.\n\nWorking from these contest rules and the ESS definition alone, and assuming the parameter regime $0VC$ in which neither pure strategy is stable, derive the mixed evolutionarily stable strategy fraction of Hawks, denoted $p^{*}$, as a closed-form expression in terms of $V$ and $C$. Provide only the final simplified analytic expression for $p^{*}$. No numerical approximation is required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the mixed evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) for the classic Hawk-Dove game under the parameter regime $0  V  C$. An ESS is a strategy such that, if all members of a population adopt it, no mutant strategy can invade under the influence of natural selection.\n\nFirst, we must construct the payoff matrix for this symmetric game. Let $E(S_1, S_2)$ denote the payoff to an individual playing strategy $S_1$ against an opponent playing strategy $S_2$. The resource has value $V0$ and the cost of injury is $C0$.\n\n1.  **Hawk versus Hawk**: The individuals fight. Each has a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$ of winning (payoff $V$) and a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$ of losing and incurring an injury (payoff $-C$). The expected payoff is:\n    $$E(H, H) = \\frac{1}{2}V + \\frac{1}{2}(-C) = \\frac{V-C}{2}$$\n2.  **Hawk versus Dove**: The Hawk is aggressive and takes the entire resource, while the Dove retreats. The Hawk's payoff is $V$.\n    $$E(H, D) = V$$\n3.  **Dove versus Hawk**: The Dove retreats and receives nothing. The Dove's payoff is $0$.\n    $$E(D, H) = 0$$\n4.  **Dove versus Dove**: The individuals engage in a display and share the resource. Each receives half the value.\n    $$E(D, D) = \\frac{V}{2}$$\n\nThe payoff matrix is therefore:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cc}\n  \\text{Hawk}  \\text{Dove} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Hawk}  \\frac{V-C}{2}  V \\\\\n\\text{Dove}  0  \\frac{V}{2}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the expected fitness (payoff) for a Hawk and a Dove in a large population where the frequency of Hawks is $p$ and the frequency of Doves is $1-p$. Individuals are matched randomly.\n\nThe expected fitness of a Hawk, $W(H, p)$, is its payoff against a Hawk multiplied by the probability of meeting a Hawk ($p$), plus its payoff against a Dove multiplied by the probability of meeting a Dove ($1-p$):\n$$W(H, p) = p \\cdot E(H, H) + (1-p) \\cdot E(H, D)$$\n$$W(H, p) = p\\left(\\frac{V-C}{2}\\right) + (1-p)V$$\n\nThe expected fitness of a Dove, $W(D, p)$, is its payoff against a Hawk ($p$) plus its payoff against a Dove ($1-p$):\n$$W(D, p) = p \\cdot E(D, H) + (1-p) \\cdot E(D, D)$$\n$$W(D, p) = p(0) + (1-p)\\frac{V}{2} = (1-p)\\frac{V}{2}$$\n\nA mixed strategy $p^*$ is an ESS if it is an equilibrium point where the fitnesses of the pure strategies are equal. At this frequency, neither strategy has a selective advantage over the other, preventing either type from increasing in frequency. This is the necessary condition for a mixed ESS. We set $W(H, p^*) = W(D, p^*)$ and solve for $p^*$.\n\n$$p^*\\left(\\frac{V-C}{2}\\right) + (1-p^*)V = (1-p^*)\\frac{V}{2}$$\n\nWe expand and rearrange the terms to solve for $p^*$:\n$$p^*\\frac{V}{2} - p^*\\frac{C}{2} + V - p^*V = \\frac{V}{2} - p^*\\frac{V}{2}$$\nGathering terms with $p^*$ to the left and constant terms to the right, we get:\n$$p^*\\frac{V}{2} - p^*\\frac{C}{2} - p^*V + p^*\\frac{V}{2} = \\frac{V}{2} - V$$\n$$p^*\\left(-\\frac{C}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{V}{2}$$\n\nMultiplying both sides by $-2$ yields:\n$$p^*C = V$$\n\nFinally, we isolate $p^*$:\n$$p^* = \\frac{V}{C}$$\n\nThe problem states that $0  V  C$. This condition ensures that $0  p^*  1$, which is required for a a non-trivial mixed strategy frequency. If $p^*=0$ or $p^*=1$, the ESS would be a pure strategy. The condition $V  C$ ensures that the pure Hawk strategy is not an ESS, because in a population of Hawks, a mutant Dove would receive a payoff of $0$, which is greater than the Hawk payoff of $\\frac{V-C}{2}  0$. The condition $V  0$ ensures that the pure Dove strategy is not an ESS, because in a population of Doves, a mutant Hawk would receive a payoff of $V$, which is greater than the Dove payoff of $\\frac{V}{2}$. Thus, for $0  V  C$, the only ESS is the mixed strategy where the fraction of Hawks is $p^* = \\frac{V}{C}$.

The symmetric payoff to a rare mutant using strategy $j$ invading a resident using strategy $i$ is given by the entry $A_{ij}$ of the payoff matrix\n$$\nA=\\begin{pmatrix}\n0  -1  1\\\\\n1  0  -1\\\\\n-1  1  0\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nAssume payoffs translate linearly into fitness and that interactions are random and pairwise.

Do not include any units. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem presented is a standard inquiry in evolutionary game theory and is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains all necessary information to proceed. It requires the determination of an interior symmetric Nash equilibrium for a given payoff matrix and an assessment of its evolutionary stability.\n\nFirst, we determine the interior symmetric Nash equilibrium, denoted by $x^{\\ast} = (x_1, x_2, x_3)^T$. A strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium if no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing their strategy. For an interior mixed strategy Nash equilibrium in a symmetric game, the payoffs for all pure strategies that are played with non-zero probability must be equal. The strategy vector $x^{\\ast}$ must lie in the simplex $\\Delta_{3}$, meaning $x_i \\ge 0$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ and $\\sum_{i=1}^{3} x_i = 1$. For an interior equilibrium, we have $x_i  0$ for all $i$.\n\nThe expected payoff to an individual using pure strategy $i$ in a population playing mixed strategy $x$ is given by the $i$-th component of the vector $Ax$.\n$$\nA x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -1  1 \\\\ 1  0  -1 \\\\ -1  1  0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -x_2 + x_3 \\\\ x_1 - x_3 \\\\ -x_1 + x_2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor an interior equilibrium $x^{\\ast}$, the payoffs must be equal:\n$$\n(A x^{\\ast})_1 = (A x^{\\ast})_2 = (A x^{\\ast})_3\n$$\nThis yields the system of equations:\n$$-x_2^{\\ast} + x_3^{\\ast} = x_1^{\\ast} - x_3^{\\ast}$$\n$$x_1^{\\ast} - x_3^{\\ast} = -x_1^{\\ast} + x_2^{\\ast}$$\nAnd the constraint from the simplex:\n$$x_1^{\\ast} + x_2^{\\ast} + x_3^{\\ast} = 1$$\n\nFrom the first equation, we get $2x_3^{\\ast} = x_1^{\\ast} + x_2^{\\ast}$.\nSubstituting the simplex constraint $x_1^{\\ast} + x_2^{\\ast} = 1 - x_3^{\\ast}$, we find $2x_3^{\\ast} = 1 - x_3^{\\ast}$, which gives $3x_3^{\\ast} = 1$, or $x_3^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nBy symmetry of the equations, or by substitution, we can deduce that all components are equal. For example, substituting $x_3^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{3}$ into the second equation gives $x_1^{\\ast} - \\frac{1}{3} = -x_1^{\\ast} + x_2^{\\ast}$, so $2x_1^{\\ast} = x_2^{\\ast} + \\frac{1}{3}$. Using the simplex constraint again, $x_2^{\\ast} = 1 - x_1^{\\ast} - x_3^{\\ast} = 1 - x_1^{\\ast} - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{2}{3} - x_1^{\\ast}$. Substituting this into the previous expression, we get $2x_1^{\\ast} = (\\frac{2}{3} - x_1^{\\ast}) + \\frac{1}{3}$, which simplifies to $2x_1^{\\ast} = 1 - x_1^{\\ast}$, so $3x_1^{\\ast}=1$, and $x_1^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{3}$. Consequently, $x_2^{\\ast} = 1 - \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}$.\nThe unique interior symmetric Nash equilibrium is therefore $x^{\\ast} = (\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3})^T$.\n\nNext, we assess whether $x^{\\ast}$ is an Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS). According to the definition by Maynard Smith, a strategy $x^{\\ast}$ is an ESS if for any other strategy $y \\neq x^{\\ast}$, the following two conditions hold:\n1. $y^T A x^{\\ast} \\le (x^{\\ast})^T A x^{\\ast}$ (Equilibrium condition)\n2. If $y^T A x^{\\ast} = (x^{\\ast})^T A x^{\\ast}$, then $y^T A y  (x^{\\ast})^T A y$ (Stability condition)\n\nLet us evaluate the terms for our equilibrium $x^{\\ast}$.\nThe expected payoff in the equilibrium population is $(x^{\\ast})^T A x^{\\ast}$. First, we compute $A x^{\\ast}$:\n$$\nA x^{\\ast} = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} \\\\ \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{1}{3} \\\\ -\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSo, the expected payoff is $(x^{\\ast})^T A x^{\\ast} = (\\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}, \\frac{1}{3}) \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = 0$.\nThe payoff for a mutant strategy $y$ in this population is $y^T A x^{\\ast} = (y_1, y_2, y_3) \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = 0$.\n\nThe first condition for an ESS is $0 \\le 0$, which is true. However, the equality $y^T A x^{\\ast} = (x^{\\ast})^T A x^{\\ast}$ holds for *every* strategy $y \\in \\Delta_3$. This means the equilibrium is neutrally stable with respect to invasion by any mutant under the first-order condition, and we must check the second condition for all $y \\neq x^{\\ast}$.\n\nThe second condition is $y^T A y  (x^{\\ast})^T A y$. Let us evaluate both sides of the inequality.\nThe left side is the quadratic form $y^T A y$. The payoff matrix $A$ is anti-symmetric, meaning $A^T = -A$. For any anti-symmetric matrix and any vector $y$, the quadratic form $y^T A y$ is identically zero. This is because $y^T A y$ is a scalar, so it is equal to its transpose: $y^T A y = (y^T A y)^T = y^T A^T y = y^T(-A)y = -y^T A y$. This implies $2 y^T A y = 0$, so $y^T A y = 0$.\n\nThe right side is $(x^{\\ast})^T A y$. Let us compute the vector $(x^{\\ast})^T A$:\n$$\n(x^{\\ast})^T A = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{1}{3}  \\frac{1}{3}  \\frac{1}{3} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -1  1 \\\\ 1  0  -1 \\\\ -1  1  0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nTherefore, $(x^{\\ast})^T A y = 0$ for any strategy $y$.\n\nSubstituting these results into the stability condition, we must check if $0  0$. This is a strict inequality that is false. The condition for evolutionary stability is not met. The \"curvature of payoffs\" mentioned in the problem is zero, as the payoff landscape $E(y, x^{\\ast}) = y^T A x^{\\ast}$ is flat, and the invasion exponent $y^T A y - (x^{\\ast})^T A y$ is zero, not strictly negative. Consequently, the Nash equilibrium $x^{\\ast}$ is not an ESS. It is merely neutrally stable, which in the context of replicator dynamics leads to persistent oscillations (cycles) around the equilibrium point rather than convergence to it.\n\nThe problem asks for the row vector of the equilibrium strategy as the final answer.",
