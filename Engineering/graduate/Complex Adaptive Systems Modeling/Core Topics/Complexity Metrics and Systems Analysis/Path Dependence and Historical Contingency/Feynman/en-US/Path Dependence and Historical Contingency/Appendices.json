This exercise  addresses a fundamental task in stochastic modeling: transforming an apparently non-Markovian process into a Markovian one by defining an \"augmented state\" that fully encapsulates the relevant history. By identifying this minimal sufficient state, you will make the system's future conditionally independent of its deep past, a crucial technique for analyzing path-dependent systems.",

            "problem": "Consider a classical Pólya urn with two colors, red and blue. At time $t=0$, the urn contains $r_{0} \\in \\mathbb{N}$ red balls and $b_{0} \\in \\mathbb{N}$ blue balls. At each discrete time step $t \\mapsto t+1$, one ball is drawn uniformly at random from the urn, its color is observed, the ball is returned to the urn, and one additional ball of the same color is added. Let $X_{t} \\in \\{\\text{red}, \\text{blue}\\}$ denote the color drawn at time $t$, and let $R_{t}$ and $B_{t}$ denote the number of red and blue balls in the urn immediately before the draw at time $t$, respectively.\n\nYou are to formalize the path dependence and historical contingency of this process using the Markov property. Starting from the standard definition of the Markov property and the sampling rule of the urn, determine a minimal sufficient augmented state process $S_{t} = \\varphi\\!\\left(X_{0}, X_{1}, \\dots, X_{t}\\right)$ such that $\\{S_{t}\\}_{t \\ge 0}$ is a time-homogeneous Markov chain whose one-step transition probabilities do not depend explicitly on $t$. Justify minimality in terms of the smallest information from the history that renders the dynamics time-homogeneous and Markov.\n\nThen, derive the exact one-step transition probabilities on this augmented state: for a generic state $(r,b)$ with $r \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $b \\in \\mathbb{N}$, write the transition probabilities to the two possible next states, namely $(r+1,b)$ and $(r,b+1)$, as exact algebraic expressions in $r$ and $b$.\n\nYour final answer must be a single row matrix with two entries corresponding to these two transition probabilities, in this order. Do not approximate any quantities.",
            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It describes the classical Pólya urn model, a fundamental stochastic process used to illustrate concepts of reinforcement and path dependence. All necessary information is provided to formalize the process and derive its transition probabilities. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\nThe core of the problem is to formalize the path-dependent nature of the Pólya urn process within the framework of Markov chains. Path dependence implies that the history of events influences future outcomes. A Markov process, by contrast, is memoryless: its future evolution depends only on its current state, not the path taken to reach it. The resolution lies in defining a state variable that completely encapsulates all relevant information from the past.\n\nLet the state of the system at time $t \\geq 0$ be defined by the pair $S_t = (R_t, B_t)$, where $R_t$ and $B_t$ are the number of red and blue balls, respectively, in the urn immediately before the draw at time $t$. The initial state is $S_0 = (r_0, b_0)$.\n\nThe state $S_t$ is a function of the history of draws, $\\{X_0, X_1, \\dots, X_{t-1}\\}$. Specifically, for $t \\ge 1$, the number of red balls $R_t$ is the initial count $r_0$ plus the number of times a red ball was drawn in the preceding $t$ steps. A similar logic applies to the blue balls. Formally:\n$$R_t = r_0 + \\sum_{i=0}^{t-1} \\mathbb{I}(X_i = \\text{red})$$\n$$B_t = b_0 + \\sum_{i=0}^{t-1} \\mathbb{I}(X_i = \\text{blue})$$\nwhere $\\mathbb{I}(\\cdot)$ is the indicator function. The state $S_t=(R_t, B_t)$ is the \"augmented state\" that accumulates historical information. The fact that different sequences of draws (paths) can lead to different states $(R_t, B_t)$ is the essence of historical contingency in this model. The total number of balls at time $t$ is $N_t = R_t + B_t = r_0 + b_0 + t$.\n\nWe must now show that the process $\\{S_t\\}_{t \\geq 0}$ is a time-homogeneous Markov chain and that $S_t$ is a minimal sufficient state.\n\n**1. Markov Property and Time-Homogeneity**\n\nTo demonstrate the Markov property, we must show that the conditional probability of the next state $S_{t+1}$ depends only on the current state $S_t$, not on any past states $S_{t-1}, \\dots, S_0$.\nThe state transition from $S_t$ to $S_{t+1}$ occurs via the draw at time $t$. Let the current state be $S_t = (R_t, B_t) = (r, b)$. The total number of balls is $r+b$.\nThe probability of drawing a red ball at time $t$ is:\n$$P(X_t = \\text{red} | S_t=(r,b), S_{t-1}, \\dots, S_0) = \\frac{r}{r+b}$$\nThis probability depends only on the components of the current state $S_t=(r,b)$. If a red ball is drawn, the urn's composition for the next step becomes $(r+1, b)$. Therefore, the next state is $S_{t+1}=(r+1, b)$.\nThe probability of drawing a blue ball is:\n$$P(X_t = \\text{blue} | S_t=(r,b), S_{t-1}, \\dots, S_0) = \\frac{b}{r+b}$$\nwhich also depends only on $S_t$. If a blue ball is drawn, the next state is $S_{t+1}=(r, b+1)$.\n\nThe one-step transition probabilities from a state $(r,b)$ are:\n$$P(S_{t+1}=(r+1, b) | S_t=(r,b)) = \\frac{r}{r+b}$$\n$$P(S_{t+1}=(r, b+1) | S_t=(r,b)) = \\frac{b}{r+b}$$\nSince these probabilities depend only on the current state $(r,b)$ and not on the time index $t$, the process $\\{S_t\\}_{t \\geq 0}$ is a time-homogeneous Markov chain.\n\n**2. Minimality**\n\nTo justify that $S_t=(R_t, B_t)$ is a minimal sufficient state, we must show that no smaller set of information can define a time-homogeneous Markov process. The transition probabilities fundamentally depend on the ratio of red to total balls, $R_t/(R_t+B_t)$, and blue to total balls, $B_t/(R_t+B_t)$. To compute these ratios, one needs to know both $R_t$ and $B_t$.\n- If the state were defined only by $R_t$, we could not compute the denominator $R_t+B_t$ without knowing $t$ or $B_t$.\n- If the state were defined only by the total number of balls $N_t = R_t+B_t = r_0+b_0+t$, which is equivalent to knowing time $t$, we could not compute the numerators $R_t$ or $B_t$.\n- If the state were the proportion of red balls, $P_t=R_t/(R_t+B_t)$, a transition to the next proportion would depend on the total number of balls $N_t$, making the process time-inhomogeneous since $N_t$ changes deterministically with time.\nThus, the pair $(R_t, B_t)$ is the minimal representation of the history necessary to specify the transition probabilities without explicit reference to time $t$.\n\n**3. Derivation of Transition Probabilities**\n\nNow, we derive the requested transition probabilities for a generic state $(r,b)$, where $r \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and $b \\in \\mathbb{N}$. The urn contains $r$ red balls and $b$ blue balls, for a total of $r+b$ balls.\n\nThe first possible next state is $(r+1, b)$. This state is reached if and only if a red ball is drawn. The probability of this event is the number of red balls divided by the total number of balls.\n$$P((r,b) \\to (r+1,b)) = \\frac{r}{r+b}$$\n\nThe second possible next state is $(r, b+1)$. This state is reached if and only if a blue ball is drawn. The probability of this event is the number of blue balls divided by the total number of balls.\n$$P((r,b) \\to (r,b+1)) = \\frac{b}{r+b}$$\n\nThese are the only two possible one-step transitions from state $(r,b)$. Their sum is $\\frac{r}{r+b} + \\frac{b}{r+b} = \\frac{r+b}{r+b} = 1$, as required for a complete probability distribution over successor states.\n\nThe final answer requires these two probabilities in a row matrix.",

It satisfies all criteria for being scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. There are no identifiable flaws. A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\n\nThe dynamics of the system are governed by the gradient flow on the potential energy landscape $V(x)$, perturbed by a stochastic term. The potential is given by:\n$$\nV(x) = \\frac{\\alpha}{4}x^{4} - \\frac{\\beta}{2}x^{2}\n$$\nThe deterministic part of the dynamics is driven by the force $F(x) = -V'(x)$. The equilibrium points of the system correspond to the locations where this force is zero, i.e., where the potential gradient is zero:\n$$\nV'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{4}x^{4} - \\frac{\\beta}{2}x^{2}\\right) = \\alpha x^{3} - \\beta x = 0\n$$\nFactoring the expression gives $x(\\alpha x^2 - \\beta) = 0$, which yields three equilibrium points:\n$x_1 = 0$\n$x_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}}$\n$x_3 = -\\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}}$\n\nTo determine the stability of these points, we examine the second derivative of the potential, $V''(x)$:\n$$\nV''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}(\\alpha x^{3} - \\beta x) = 3\\alpha x^{2} - \\beta\n$$\n- At $x_1 = 0$: $V''(0) = -\\beta$. Since $\\beta = 3 > 0$, $V''(0)  0$. This indicates that $x=0$ is a local maximum, corresponding to an unstable equilibrium (a saddle point or potential barrier peak).\n- At $x_{2,3} = \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}}$: $V''\\left(\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}}\\right) = 3\\alpha\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}\\right) - \\beta = 3\\beta - \\beta = 2\\beta$. Since $\\beta=3>0$, $V''(\\pm\\sqrt{\\beta/\\alpha}) > 0$. This indicates that these two points are local minima, corresponding to stable equilibrium states (the bottoms of the potential wells).\n\nThe problem states the system starts in the left well, which is the basin of attraction for the stable minimum at $x_{\\text{min}} = -\\sqrt{\\beta/\\alpha}$. For the system to escape to the right well (around $x=+\\sqrt{\\beta/\\alpha}$), it must pass over the potential barrier located at the saddle point $x_{\\text{saddle}} = 0$.\n\nThe energy barrier, $\\Delta V$, is the difference in potential energy between the saddle point and the initial well's minimum:\n$$\n\\Delta V = V(x_{\\text{saddle}}) - V(x_{\\text{min}}) = V(0) - V\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}}\\right)\n$$\nWe calculate the potential at these points:\n$V(0) = \\frac{\\alpha}{4}(0)^{4} - \\frac{\\beta}{2}(0)^{2} = 0$\n$V\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}}\\right) = \\frac{\\alpha}{4}\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}}\\right)^4 - \\frac{\\beta}{2}\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\alpha}{4}\\left(\\frac{\\beta^2}{\\alpha^2}\\right) - \\frac{\\beta}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha}\\right) = \\frac{\\beta^2}{4\\alpha} - \\frac{\\beta^2}{2\\alpha} = -\\frac{\\beta^2}{4\\alpha}$\nTherefore, the energy barrier is:\n$$\n\\Delta V = 0 - \\left(-\\frac{\\beta^2}{4\\alpha}\\right) = \\frac{\\beta^2}{4\\alpha}\n$$\nThe expected escape time $\\tau$ can be estimated using Kramers' rate formula for the overdamped limit. The escape rate $k$ (the probability per unit time of an escape event) is given by:\n$$\nk = \\frac{\\sqrt{V''(x_{\\text{min}}) |V''(x_{\\text{saddle}})|}}{2\\pi} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta V}{\\varepsilon}\\right)\n$$\nHere, we have identified the noise term $\\varepsilon$ in the given SDE with the thermal energy scale $k_B T$ in the standard physics formulation, and the friction coefficient is implicitly $\\gamma=1$.\nWe have:\n$V''(x_{\\text{min}}) = V''(-\\sqrt{\\beta/\\alpha}) = 2\\beta$\n$V''(x_{\\text{saddle}}) = V''(0) = -\\beta$, so $|V''(x_{\\text{saddle}})| = \\beta$.\n\nSubstituting these into the rate formula:\n$$\nk = \\frac{\\sqrt{(2\\beta)(\\beta)}}{2\\pi} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta^2}{4\\alpha\\varepsilon}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2\\beta^2}}{2\\pi} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta^2}{4\\alpha\\varepsilon}\\right) = \\frac{\\beta\\sqrt{2}}{2\\pi} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta^2}{4\\alpha\\varepsilon}\\right)\n$$\nThe expected escape time $\\tau$ is the reciprocal of the rate $k$:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{1}{k} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\beta\\sqrt{2}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta^2}{4\\alpha\\varepsilon}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi\\sqrt{2}}{\\beta} \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\beta^2}{4\\alpha\\varepsilon}\\right)\n$$\nThis expression provides the mean first passage time from the left well to the right well.\n\n**Connection to Path Dependence and Historical Contingency**\nThis model provides a clear illustration of path dependence and historical contingency.\n1.  **Path Dependence:** The long-term state of the system is dependent on its history. The initial condition places the system in the left well. Due to the energy barrier $\\Delta V$ and the small noise intensity $\\varepsilon$, the system will remain trapped in this well for a long time, on average for a duration of $\\tau$. The system's state at any time $t \\ll \\tau$ is overwhelmingly likely to be in the left well. Thus, the future state exhibits a strong dependence on its past trajectory.\n2.  **Historical Contingency:** The transition from the left well to the right well is a rare, stochastic event. The exact moment of escape is unpredictable; it is a \"contingent\" event. If, by chance, a sufficiently large series of noise fluctuations compounds to push the system over the barrier at an early time (a \"historical accident\"), the system's fate is dramatically altered. It becomes \"locked-in\" to the basin of attraction of the right well, where it will again remain for a long time (on average, another period of $\\tau$). The long-term history of the system is therefore not pre-ordained but is contingent upon the random occurrence of this rare escape event. An observer encountering the system long after such a switch might be unable to infer its original state, as the system now appears to naturally belong to the right well.\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\nWe substitute the given values $\\alpha = 1$, $\\beta = 3$, and $\\varepsilon = 0.2$ into the expression for $\\tau$.\nFirst, we compute the argument of the exponential:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta V}{\\varepsilon} = \\frac{\\beta^2}{4\\alpha\\varepsilon} = \\frac{3^2}{4(1)(0.2)} = \\frac{9}{0.8} = 11.25\n$$\nNow, we compute the pre-factor:\n$$\n\\frac{\\pi\\sqrt{2}}{\\beta} = \\frac{\\pi\\sqrt{2}}{3}\n$$\nPutting it all together:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{\\pi\\sqrt{2}}{3} \\exp(11.25)\n$$\nWe now compute the numerical value:\n$$\n\\tau \\approx \\frac{3.14159 \\times 1.41421}{3} \\times \\exp(11.25) \\approx \\frac{4.44288}{3} \\times 76878.56 \\approx 1.48096 \\times 76878.56\n$$\n$$\n\\tau \\approx 113851.34\n$$\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\tau \\approx 113900 \\text{ s}\n$$\nThis can be expressed in scientific notation as $1.139 \\times 10^5$ seconds.",

The expectation over genotypes and landscapes is\n$$\n\\mathbb{E}[f_i(X)f_i(Y_h)] = \\sigma^2 P(X_{\\mathcal{N}_i} = (Y_h)_{\\mathcal{N}_i})\n$$\nThe inputs $X_{\\mathcal{N}_i}$ and $(Y_h)_{\\mathcal{N}_i}$ are identical if and only if none of the $h$ loci that differ between $X$ and $Y_h$ fall into the neighborhood $\\mathcal{N}_i$. The set of differing loci, $S_h$, is a uniformly random subset of size $h$ from $\\{1, \\dots, N\\}$. The neighborhood $\\mathcal{N}_i$ is a set of $K+1$ loci. The probability that a random draw of $h$ loci is disjoint from a fixed set of $K+1$ loci is given by the hypergeometric distribution. We are choosing $h$ loci out of $N$, and we want to choose $0$ from the $K+1$ in $\\mathcal{N}_i$ and $h$ from the $N-(K+1)$ outside $\\mathcal{N}_i$.\n$$\nP(X_{\\mathcal{N}_i} = (Y_h)_{\\mathcal{N}_i}) = P(S_h \\cap \\mathcal{N}_i = \\emptyset) = \\frac{\\binom{K+1}{0} \\binom{N-(K+1)}{h}}{\\binom{N}{h}} = \\frac{\\binom{N-K-1}{h}}{\\binom{N}{h}}\n$$\nThis probability is the same for all $i$. Substituting this back into the covariance expression:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cov}(W(X), W(Y_h)) = \\frac{1}{N^2} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sigma^2 \\frac{\\binom{N-K-1}{h}}{\\binom{N}{h}} = \\frac{N\\sigma^2}{N^2} \\frac{\\binom{N-K-1}{h}}{\\binom{N}{h}} = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{N} \\frac{\\binom{N-K-1}{h}}{\\binom{N}{h}}\n$$\nNow we can compute $\\rho(h)$:\n$$\n\\rho(h) = \\frac{\\frac{\\sigma^2}{N} \\frac{\\binom{N-K-1}{h}}{\\binom{N}{h}}}{\\frac{\\sigma^2}{N}} = \\frac{\\binom{N-K-1}{h}}{\\binom{N}{h}}\n$$\nThis is the exact expression for the autocorrelation function. This is valid for $h \\le N-K-1$; for $h > N-K-1$, $\\rho(h)=0$.\n\nNext, we derive the autocorrelation length $\\ell$, defined by $\\rho(1) = \\exp(-1/\\ell)$. We evaluate $\\rho(h)$ at $h=1$:\n$$\n\\rho(1) = \\frac{\\binom{N-K-1}{1}}{\\binom{N}{1}} = \\frac{N-K-1}{N} = 1 - \\frac{K+1}{N}\n$$\nUsing the definition of $\\ell$:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\ell}\\right) = 1 - \\frac{K+1}{N}\n$$\nSolving for $\\ell$ by taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{\\ell} = \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{K+1}{N}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\ell = -\\frac{1}{\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{K+1}{N}\\right)}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for $\\ell$ in terms of $N$ and $K$.\n\nFinally, we must show that $\\ell$ is a strictly decreasing function of $K$, treating $K$ as a real parameter in $[0, N-1)$. We compute the derivative $\\frac{d\\ell}{dK}$:\nLet $u(K) = 1 - \\frac{K+1}{N}$. Then $\\frac{du}{dK} = -\\frac{1}{N}$.\nThe expression for $\\ell$ is $\\ell(K) = -(\\ln(u(K)))^{-1}$. Using the chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\ell}{dK} = -(-1)(\\ln(u(K)))^{-2} \\cdot \\frac{d}{dK}(\\ln(u(K))) = (\\ln(u(K)))^{-2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{u(K)} \\cdot \\frac{du}{dK}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $u(K)$ and its derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\ell}{dK} = \\frac{1}{\\left(\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{K+1}{N}\\right)\\right)^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{K+1}{N}} \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{N}\\right)\n$$\nWe analyze the sign of each term for $K \\in [0, N-1)$:\n1. For $K \\in [0, N-1)$, we have $1 \\le K+1  N$, so $0  \\frac{K+1}{N}  1$.\n2. This implies $0  1 - \\frac{K+1}{N}  1$.\n3. The logarithm of a number between $0$ and $1$ is negative, so $\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{K+1}{N}\\right)  0$. Its square is positive: $\\left(\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{K+1}{N}\\right)\\right)^2 > 0$.\n4. The term $1 - \\frac{K+1}{N}$ is positive. Its reciprocal is also positive.\n5. The final term, $-\\frac{1}{N}$, is negative since $N \\ge 1$.\nCombining these, $\\frac{d\\ell}{dK}  0$ for all $K \\in [0, N-1)$. This proves that $\\ell$ is a strictly decreasing function of $K$.\n\nThe decrease in correlation length $\\ell$ with increasing epistasis $K$ signifies that the fitness landscape becomes more \"rugged\". A smaller $\\ell$ means that fitness values of genotypes decorrelate more quickly with Hamming distance. On a rugged landscape, an adaptive walk (e.g., local hill-climbing) is more likely to become trapped on a suboptimal local fitness peak. The specific peak reached is highly sensitive to the starting genotype and the sequence of mutations. This strong dependence of the final state on the historical trajectory is the essence of path dependence. Therefore, increasing $K$ increases the ruggedness of the landscape, which in turn leads to greater path dependence in evolutionary dynamics.",
