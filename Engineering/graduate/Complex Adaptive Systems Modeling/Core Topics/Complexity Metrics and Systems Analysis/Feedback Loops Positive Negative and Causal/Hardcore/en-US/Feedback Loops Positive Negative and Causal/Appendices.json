            "problem": "Consider a causal loop diagram with two stocks: $P(t)$ representing an adaptive agent population and $K(t)$ representing accumulated knowledge capital. The diagram contains two closed loops:\n\n- A reinforcing loop $R$: knowledge increases adoption, and adoption increases knowledge.

Compute the dominant eigenvalue of the Jacobian at $(P^{*}, K^{*})$.\n\n**Validation Verdict:**\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem uses a standard stock-and-flow modeling approach combined with mass-action kinetics (similar to Lotka-Volterra models), which are fundamental and well-established frameworks in systems dynamics, theoretical ecology, and complex adaptive systems modeling.

I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Solution Derivation\n\n**1. Formulation of the ODE System**\n\nBased on the fundamental definition that the rate of change of a stock is its total inflows minus its total outflows, we construct the differential equations for $P(t)$ and $K(t)$.\n\nFor the population stock $P(t)$:\n- Inflow (Adoption): $a K P$\n- Outflow (Abandonment): $b P$\nThe rate of change is:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{dt} = a K P - b P = P(aK - b) $$\n\nFor the knowledge stock $K(t)$:\n- Inflow (Production): $u P$\n- Outflow (Obsolescence): $v K$\nThe rate of change is:\n$$ \\frac{dK}{dt} = u P - v K $$\n\nThe system of ODEs is:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{dt} = P(t)(aK(t) - b) $$\n$$ \\frac{dK}{dt} = uP(t) - vK(t) $$\n\n**2. Nontrivial Equilibrium Point**\n\nThe equilibrium points $(P^{*}, K^{*})$ are found by setting the time derivatives to zero:\n$$ \\frac{dP}{dt} = P^{*}(aK^{*} - b) = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{dK}{dt} = uP^{*} - vK^{*} = 0 $$\n\nFrom the first equation, we have two possibilities: $P^{*} = 0$ or $aK^{*} - b = 0$.\nIf $P^{*} = 0$, the second equation gives $u(0) - vK^{*} = 0$, which implies $K^{*} = 0$. This yields the trivial equilibrium point $(0, 0)$.\n\nThe problem asks for the nontrivial interior equilibrium, where $P^{*} > 0$ and $K^{*} > 0$. For this, we must have $P^{*} \\ne 0$, so the first equation requires:\n$$ aK^{*} - b = 0 \\implies K^{*} = \\frac{b}{a} $$\nSince $a > 0$ and $b > 0$, we have $K^{*} > 0$.\n\nSubstituting this result for $K^{*}$ into the second equilibrium equation:\n$$ uP^{*} - v\\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right) = 0 $$\n$$ uP^{*} = \\frac{vb}{a} $$\n$$ P^{*} = \\frac{vb}{ua} $$\nSince $u > 0$, $v > 0$, $b > 0$, and $a > 0$, we have $P^{*} > 0$.\n\nThus, the unique nontrivial equilibrium point is $(P^{*}, K^{*}) = \\left(\\frac{vb}{ua}, \\frac{b}{a}\\right)$.\n\n**3. Jacobian Matrix at the Equilibrium**\n\nThe Jacobian matrix $J$ of the system is a matrix of partial derivatives of the rate functions. Let $f(P, K) = P(aK - b) = aPK - bP$ and $g(P, K) = uP - vK$.\n$$ J(P, K) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial P}  \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial K} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial P}  \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial K} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} aK - b  aP \\\\ u  -v \\end{pmatrix} $$\nNow, we evaluate this matrix at the nontrivial equilibrium point $(P^{*}, K^{*}) = \\left(\\frac{vb}{ua}, \\frac{b}{a}\\right)$:\n$$ J^{*} = J(P^{*}, K^{*}) = \\begin{pmatrix} a\\left(\\frac{b}{a}\\right) - b  a\\left(\\frac{vb}{ua}\\right) \\\\ u  -v \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} b - b  \\frac{vb}{u} \\\\ u  -v \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  \\frac{vb}{u} \\\\ u  -v \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n**4. Loop Polarity Verification and Connection to the Jacobian**\n\nA causal link from a variable $X$ to a variable $Y$ is positive if an increase in $X$ causes an increase in the rate of change of $Y$ ($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X} (\\frac{dY}{dt}) > 0$), and negative otherwise. The polarity of a loop is the product of the signs of its constituent links.\n\n- **Reinforcing Loop R ($K \\to P \\to K$):**\n  - Link $K \\to P$: The effect of $K$ on the rate of change of $P$ is $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial K}(\\frac{dP}{dt}) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial K}(aPK - bP) = aP$. Since $P > 0$ in the region of interest, this link is positive ($+$).\n  - Link $P \\to K$: The effect of $P$ on the rate of change of $K$ is $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial P}(\\frac{dK}{dt}) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial P}(uP - vK) = u$. Since $u > 0$, this link is positive ($+$).\n  - Loop Polarity of R: $(+) \\times (+) = (+)$. This confirms $R$ is a reinforcing loop.\n\n- **Balancing Loop B ($P \\to P$):**\n  - This loop represents the effect of the population $P$ on its own change via the abandonment outflow. The outflow is $bP$. The effect of this term on the rate of change of $P$ is $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial P}(-bP) = -b$. Since $b > 0$, this effect is negative ($-$), confirming $B$ is a balancing loop.\n\nThe elements of the Jacobian matrix $J^{*}$ represent these linearized causal effects at the equilibrium:\n- $J^{*}_{12} = aP^{*} = \\frac{vb}{u} > 0$: This is the positive effect of $K$ on $P$'s growth rate (link $K \\to P$).\n- $J^{*}_{21} = u > 0$: This is the positive effect of $P$ on $K$'s growth rate (link $P \\to K$).\nThe product of the off-diagonal elements, $J^{*}_{12}J^{*}_{21} = (\\frac{vb}{u})(u) = vb > 0$, represents the positive gain of the reinforcing feedback loop $R$.\n- $J^{*}_{11} = aK^{*} - b = 0$: This term represents the net self-effect on $P$. At equilibrium, the reinforcing effect of knowledge ($aK^{*}$) perfectly cancels the self-limiting balancing effect of abandonment ($-b$).\n- $J^{*}_{22} = -v  0$: This represents the self-damping effect on knowledge due to obsolescence.\n\n**5. Dominant Eigenvalue of the Jacobian**\n\nThe eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of the Jacobian matrix $J^{*}$ are the roots of the characteristic equation $\\det(J^{*} - \\lambda I) = 0$, where $I$ is the identity matrix.\n$$ \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 0 - \\lambda  \\frac{vb}{u} \\\\ u  -v - \\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = 0 $$\n$$ (-\\lambda)(-v - \\lambda) - \\left(\\frac{vb}{u}\\right)(u) = 0 $$\n$$ \\lambda(v + \\lambda) - vb = 0 $$\n$$ \\lambda^2 + v\\lambda - vb = 0 $$\n\nWe solve this quadratic equation for $\\lambda$ using the quadratic formula, $\\lambda = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A}$, with $A=1$, $B=v$, and $C=-vb$.\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{-v \\pm \\sqrt{v^2 - 4(1)(-vb)}}{2(1)} $$\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{-v \\pm \\sqrt{v^2 + 4vb}}{2} $$\n\nThe two eigenvalues are:\n$$ \\lambda_1 = \\frac{-v + \\sqrt{v^2 + 4vb}}{2} $$\n$$ \\lambda_2 = \\frac{-v - \\sqrt{v^2 + 4vb}}{2} $$\n\nThe dominant eigenvalue is the one with the largest real part. Since $v > 0$ and $b > 0$, the term $v^2 + 4vb$ is positive, so the square root is real.\nFurthermore, $v^2 + 4vb > v^2$, which implies $\\sqrt{v^2 + 4vb} > \\sqrt{v^2} = v$.\nTherefore:\n- $\\lambda_1 = \\frac{1}{2}(-v + (\\text{a value greater than } v)) > 0$.\n- $\\lambda_2 = \\frac{1}{2}(-v - (\\text{a value greater than } v))  0$.\n\nThe dominant eigenvalue is $\\lambda_1$, which is positive. This indicates that the nontrivial equilibrium point is unstable (specifically, a saddle point), and the system will typically grow away from this point, driven by the reinforcing loop's dynamics.\n\nThe final expression for the dominant eigenvalue is $\\lambda_1$.",

Under the standard interpretation, an edge from variable $U$ to the net rate of change of variable $V$ with positive polarity means that, holding all other variables fixed, increasing $U$ increases the net rate of change of $V$; formally, for a stock-flow system with ordinary differential equations (ODEs) $\\dot V = F_V(\\cdot)$, the polarity from $U$ to $V$ is positive if and only if $\\partial F_V / \\partial U > 0$, and negative if and only if $\\partial F_V / \\partial U  0$, evaluated on the relevant domain.

The phrase \"on the relevant domain\" is a standard qualifier in system dynamics, acknowledging that causal polarities may not hold globally but are characteristic of the system's behavior in a region of interest (e.g., during growth, away from equilibrium).\n4.  **Unrealistic or Infeasible**: The models presented are standard, simple forms used in population dynamics and other fields (e.g., forms of logistic and Lotka-Volterra equations).\n5.  **Ill-Posed or Poorly Structured**: A unique and meaningful solution can be found by systematically analyzing the options.\n6.  **Pseudo-Profound, Trivial, or Tautological**: The problem requires non-trivial analysis of both the static structure (correspondence to CLD) and dynamic behavior (stability analysis, dimensionality) of several differential equation systems. It highlights a genuine and important ambiguity in qualitative modeling.\n7.  **Outside Scientific Verifiability**: All claims and analyses are mathematically verifiable.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nTo be consistent with the specified causal loop diagram (CLD), a stock-flow model for the net rate of change of stock $X$, denoted $\\dot{X} = F_X(X, Y, ...)$, must satisfy the following three conditions based on the provided partial derivative definitions:\n\n1.  **Reinforcing loop $X \\to \\dot{X}$**: The partial derivative of the net rate of change of $X$ with respect to $X$ must be positive: $\\partial F_X / \\partial X > 0$.\n2.  **Balancing loop link $Y \\to \\dot{X}$**: The partial derivative of the net rate of change of $X$ with respect to the regulator $Y$ must be negative: $\\partial F_X / \\partial Y  0$.\n3.  **Balancing loop link $X \\to Y$**: The influence of $X$ on $Y$ must be positive. If $Y$ is a stock with rate equation $\\dot{Y} = F_Y(X, Y, ...)$, this means $\\partial F_Y / \\partial X > 0$. If $Y$ is an auxiliary variable defined as $Y = f(X)$, this means $dY/dX > 0$.\n\nWe will now evaluate each option against these conditions and the inequivalence requirement.\n\n**Analysis of Option A**\n\n*   **Model I**: A two-stock system with $X$ and $Y$.\n    *   Equations: $\\dot X = \\alpha X - \\beta X Y$, $\\dot Y = \\kappa (X - Y)$.\n    *   **CLD Consistency Check**:\n        1.  $F_X(X, Y) = \\alpha X - \\beta X Y$. We have $\\partial F_X / \\partial X = \\alpha - \\beta Y$. This is positive only on the domain where $Y  \\alpha / \\beta$. This is a common feature in models with competing feedback loops; the CLD reflects the dynamics in a specific regime, typically the initial growth phase before the balancing loop dominates. We accept this as consistent with the problem's qualifier \"on the relevant domain\".\n        2.  $\\partial F_X / \\partial Y = -\\beta X$. Since $\\beta > 0$ and we consider the non-negative state space where $X > 0$, this is negative. This condition is met.\n        3.  $F_Y(X, Y) = \\kappa X - \\kappa Y$. We have $\\partial F_Y / \\partial X = \\kappa$. Since $\\kappa > 0$, this condition is met.\n        *   Conclusion: Model I is consistent with the CLD.\n    *   **Dynamical Behavior**: This is a $2$-dimensional system of ODEs similar to a predator-prey model. The non-trivial fixed point is at $(\\alpha/\\beta, \\alpha/\\beta)$. The Jacobian matrix at this point is $J = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -\\alpha \\\\ \\kappa  -\\kappa \\end{pmatrix}$. The characteristic equation is $\\lambda^2 + \\kappa\\lambda + \\alpha\\kappa = 0$. The eigenvalues are $\\lambda = \\frac{-\\kappa \\pm \\sqrt{\\kappa^2 - 4\\alpha\\kappa}}{2}$. If $\\kappa  4\\alpha$, the eigenvalues are complex with a negative real part, indicating that the system exhibits damped oscillations as it approaches the equilibrium (a stable spiral).\n*   **Model II**: A one-stock system with stock $X$ and auxiliary $Y = \\eta X$.\n    *   Equation: $\\dot X = \\alpha X - \\beta X Y = \\alpha X - \\beta X (\\eta X) = \\alpha X - \\beta \\eta X^2$.\n    *   **CLD Consistency Check**: The CLD reflects the causal structure of the underlying rate equation formulation, $F_X(X, Y) = \\alpha X - \\beta X Y$.\n        1.  $\\partial F_X / \\partial X = \\alpha - \\beta Y$. Substituting $Y = \\eta X$, the condition becomes $\\alpha - \\beta \\eta X > 0$, which holds on the domain $X  \\alpha / (\\beta \\eta)$. This is consistent with the CLD in the growth phase.\n        2.  $\\partial F_X / \\partial Y = -\\beta X  0$. This condition is met.\n        3.  $Y = \\eta X$, so $dY/dX = \\eta > 0$. This condition is met.\n        *   Conclusion: Model II is consistent with the CLD.\n    *   **Dynamical Behavior**: This is the standard $1$-dimensional logistic growth equation, $\\dot X = X(\\alpha - \\beta \\eta X)$. For any positive initial condition, $X(t)$ will approach the stable equilibrium (carrying capacity) $K = \\alpha / (\\beta \\eta)$ monotonically. The system cannot exhibit oscillations.\n*   **Inequivalence Check**: Model I is a $2$D system that can exhibit transient oscillations. Model II is a $1$D system that cannot. Their phase portraits have different dimensionality, and their qualitative behaviors are distinct. Thus, they are inequivalent.\n\n**Verdict for Option A**: This option presents two models that are both consistent with the given CLD but are dynamically inequivalent. This is a correct choice.\n\n**Analysis of Option B**\n\n*   **Model I**: $\\dot X = \\alpha X - \\beta X Y$, $\\dot Y = \\gamma X + \\delta Y$.\n    *   **CLD Consistency Check**: The equation for $\\dot{Y}$ yields $\\partial \\dot{Y} / \\partial Y = \\delta$. Since $\\delta > 0$, this implies a positive causal link from $Y$ to its own rate of change ($\\dot{Y}$). This is a self-reinforcing loop for $Y$, which is an additional edge not specified in the problem's CLD description (\"no other edges present\").\n    *   Conclusion: Model I is inconsistent with the CLD.\n*   **Model II**: $\\dot X = \\alpha X + \\beta X Y$.\n    *   **CLD Consistency Check**: Here $F_X(X, Y) = \\alpha X + \\beta XY$. The partial derivative with respect to $Y$ is $\\partial F_X / \\partial Y = \\beta X$. Since $\\beta > 0$ and $X > 0$, this is positive. This violates the required condition $\\partial \\dot{X} / \\partial Y  0$ for the balancing loop.\n    *   Conclusion: Model II is inconsistent with the CLD.\n\n**Verdict for Option B**: Incorrect. Neither model is consistent with the specified CLD.\n\n**Analysis of Option C**\n\n*   **Model I**: $\\dot X = \\alpha X + \\beta X Y, \\quad \\dot Y = \\kappa (X - Y)$.\n    *   **CLD Consistency Check**: $F_X(X, Y) = \\alpha X + \\beta X Y$. The partial derivative is $\\partial F_X / \\partial Y = \\beta X > 0$. This violates the condition $\\partial \\dot{X} / \\partial Y  0$. The loop through $Y$ is reinforcing, not balancing.\n    *   Conclusion: Model I is inconsistent with the CLD.\n*   **Model II**: Similarly, $\\dot X = \\alpha X + \\beta X Y$ is inconsistent for the same reason.\n\n**Verdict for Option C**: Incorrect. Neither model is consistent with the specified CLD.\n\n**Analysis of Option D**\n\n*   **Model I**: Stock $X$ with auxiliary $Y = \\eta X$, and $\\dot X = \\alpha X - \\beta X^2$.\n    *   This is mathematically identical to Model II in Option A, just with a substitution of parameters ($\\beta\\eta$ from Option A is equivalent to $\\beta$ here). As analyzed before, this model is consistent with the CLD.\n*   **Model II**: Stock $X$ with auxiliary $Y = K X$, and $\\dot X = \\alpha X - \\frac{\\beta}{K} X Y$.\n    *   **CLD Consistency Check**: This model appears different, but upon substituting the auxiliary variable, we get:\n    $$ \\dot X = \\alpha X - \\frac{\\beta}{K} X (KX) = \\alpha X - \\beta X^2 $$\n    *   This equation is mathematically identical to the equation for Model I.\n*   **Inequivalence Check**: Since both Model I and Model II reduce to the exact same differential equation $\\dot X = \\alpha X - \\beta X^2$, they are mathematically equivalent. They will produce identical dynamics and are therefore not inequivalent.\n\n**Verdict for Option D**: Incorrect. The two models presented are equivalent, not inequivalent.\n\n**Final Conclusion**\n\nOnly Option A provides a pair of models where both are consistent with the specified CLD, and they exhibit qualitatively distinct dynamical behaviors, thus fulfilling the \"inequivalent\" criterion. This option correctly illustrates how a single CLD can represent multiple, dynamically different, underlying quantitative models, a key concept in system dynamics.",

            "introduction": "Many complex adaptive systems, from ecosystems to social networks, exhibit tipping points where a small change can trigger a large, often irreversible shift in system state. This practice provides a hands-on opportunity to model this critical phenomenon from first principles, combining reinforcing and balancing feedbacks to create a bistable system . By deriving the model and implementing an algorithm to analyze its behavior, you will gain a concrete understanding of how feedback structures generate the nonlinear dynamics that define complex systems.",

            "problem": "Consider a well-mixed population in which a fraction $x(t) \\in [0,1]$ has adopted a new behavior at time $t$. A positive social influence (reinforcing feedback) implies that the net adoption drift is increasing in $x$, while saturation (balancing feedback) implies that $x=0$ and $x=1$ are absorbing states. Assume a deterministic mean-field description with the following core structural constraints derived from fundamental modeling definitions:\n- Absorbing boundaries: the expected rate of change satisfies $f(0)=0$ and $f(1)=0$.\n- A single interior critical adoption threshold $x=\\theta$ with $\\theta \\in (0,1)$ exists such that $f(\\theta)=0$, $f(x)0$ for $x \\in (0,\\theta)$, and $f(x)0$ for $x \\in (\\theta,1)$, embodying reinforcing social influence around the interior threshold and balancing saturation at the boundaries.\n- Time-scale separability: there is a positive scalar rate parameter $r0$ controlling the overall time scale of the drift $f(x)$, without changing its sign structure.\n- Minimal smoothness and simplicity: among smooth functions satisfying the above sign and zero constraints, select the polynomial of minimal degree.\n\nTasks:\n1. From the above structural constraints alone, derive the minimal-degree polynomial drift $f(x)$ consistent with the sign pattern and zero locations, and identify all equilibria. Using linearization, determine the local stability of each equilibrium via the sign of $f'(x^\\star)$.\n2. Define tipping in this model as the existence of a critical fraction $x=\\theta$ that separates basins of attraction of the two stable equilibria. Characterize the tipping threshold and explain how infinitesimal perturbations around $x=\\theta$ determine long-run outcomes.\n3. Design an algorithm that, given $(r,\\theta,x_0)$ with $r0$, $\\theta \\in (0,1)$, and initial condition $x_0 \\in [0,1]$, returns two quantities: \n   - the asymptotic adoption level $x_\\infty$ attained as $t \\to \\infty$ under the deterministic dynamics, and \n   - the sign of the local Jacobian at that equilibrium, $\\operatorname{sign}(f'(x_\\infty)) \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$, where $-1$ indicates locally balancing (stable), $+1$ indicates locally reinforcing (unstable), and $0$ indicates neutral (marginal).\n4. Implement this algorithm as a complete, runnable program. Use the following test suite of parameter values to exercise general behavior, an edge case, and near-boundary thresholds:\n   - $(r,\\theta,x_0)=(1.5,0.3,0.1)$,\n   - $(r,\\theta,x_0)=(1.5,0.3,0.8)$,\n   - $(r,\\theta,x_0)=(0.8,0.5,0.5)$,\n   - $(r,\\theta,x_0)=(2.0,0.99,0.98)$,\n   - $(r,\\theta,x_0)=(2.0,0.99,0.991)$.\n   All numbers above are dimensionless.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results for all test cases as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each element is itself a two-element list of the form [x_infty, s], with x_infty a float and s an integer in {-1,0,1}. For example, a valid output structure looks like [[0.0,-1],[1.0,-1],[$\\dots$,$\\dots$],[$\\dots$,$\\dots$],[$\\dots$,$\\dots$]].",
            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of dynamical systems theory, well-posed, and objective. The constraints provided are self-contained and sufficient to derive a unique solution without contradiction.\n\nThe problem asks for the analysis of a deterministic mean-field model for the adoption of a new behavior, described by the fraction of adopters $x(t) \\in [0,1]$. The rate of change, or drift, is given by $\\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x)$.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Drift Function and Stability Analysis**\n\nThe problem imposes several structural constraints on the drift function $f(x)$.\n\nFirst, we are given that $x=0$ and $x=1$ are absorbing boundaries, which translates to the mathematical conditions $f(0)=0$ and $f(1)=0$.\n\nSecond, there is a single interior critical adoption threshold $x=\\theta \\in (0,1)$ which is also an equilibrium point, so $f(\\theta)=0$. These three conditions, $f(0)=0$, $f(\\theta)=0$, and $f(1)=0$, imply that the function $f(x)$ has roots at $x=0$, $x=\\theta$, and $x=1$. The constraint that we must select the polynomial of minimal degree satisfying these conditions leads us to a cubic polynomial, as a polynomial with three distinct roots must be of at least degree $3$. We can express this polynomial in its factored form:\n$$f(x) = K \\cdot x(x-\\theta)(x-1)$$\nwhere $K$ is a constant of proportionality.\n\nThird, we use the sign constraints to determine the sign of $K$. We are given that $f(x)  0$ for $x \\in (0,\\theta)$ and $f(x)  0$ for $x \\in (\\theta,1)$. Let's analyze the product $x(x-\\theta)(x-1)$:\n- For $x \\in (0, \\theta)$: $x$ is positive, $(x-\\theta)$ is negative, and $(x-1)$ is negative. The product $x(x-\\theta)(x-1)$ is positive. To make $f(x)$ negative, $K$ must be negative.\n- For $x \\in (\\theta, 1)$: $x$ is positive, $(x-\\theta)$ is positive, and $(x-1)$ is negative. The product $x(x-\\theta)(x-1)$ is negative. To make $f(x)$ positive, $K$ must be negative.\n\nBoth conditions require $K  0$. We can rewrite the function by letting $K = -r$, where $r  0$ is a positive scalar. This aligns with the fourth constraint of time-scale separability, where $r$ is a positive rate parameter. This gives:\n$$f(x) = -r \\cdot x(x-\\theta)(x-1) = r \\cdot x(1-x)(x-\\theta)$$\nThis is the minimal-degree polynomial drift function consistent with all given constraints.\n\nThe equilibria, or fixed points $x^\\star$, are the solutions to $f(x^\\star) = 0$. From the construction, these are:\n$$x_1^\\star = 0, \\quad x_2^\\star = \\theta, \\quad x_3^\\star = 1$$\n\nTo determine the local stability of each equilibrium, we analyze the sign of the Jacobian, which in this one-dimensional system is the first derivative $f'(x^\\star)$. A negative sign ($f'(x^\\star)0$) indicates a stable equilibrium (balancing feedback), while a positive sign ($f'(x^\\star)0$) indicates an unstable equilibrium (reinforcing feedback).\n\nFirst, we find the derivative of $f(x)$:\n$$f(x) = r(x - x^2)(x-\\theta) = r(x^2 - \\theta x - x^3 + \\theta x^2) = r(-x^3 + (1+\\theta)x^2 - \\theta x)$$\n$$f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}f(x) = r(-3x^2 + 2(1+\\theta)x - \\theta)$$\n\nNow, we evaluate $f'(x)$ at each equilibrium point:\n- At $x_1^\\star = 0$:\n  $f'(0) = r(-3(0)^2 + 2(1+\\theta)(0) - \\theta) = -r\\theta$.\n  Since $r0$ and $\\theta \\in (0,1)$, $f'(0)  0$. Thus, $x^\\star=0$ is a **stable** equilibrium.\n\n- At $x_3^\\star = 1$:\n  $f'(1) = r(-3(1)^2 + 2(1+\\theta)(1) - \\theta) = r(-3 + 2 + 2\\theta - \\theta) = r(\\theta - 1)$.\n  Since $r0$ and $\\theta \\in (0,1)$, $(\\theta-1)  0$, so $f'(1)  0$. Thus, $x^\\star=1$ is a **stable** equilibrium.\n\n- At $x_2^\\star = \\theta$:\n  $f'(\\theta) = r(-3\\theta^2 + 2(1+\\theta)\\theta - \\theta) = r(-3\\theta^2 + 2\\theta + 2\\theta^2 - \\theta) = r(-\\theta^2 + \\theta) = r\\theta(1-\\theta)$.\n  Since $r0$ and $\\theta \\in (0,1)$, both $\\theta$ and $(1-\\theta)$ are positive. Thus, $f'(\\theta)  0$. So, $x^\\star=\\theta$ is an **unstable** equilibrium.\n\n**2. Characterization of Tipping**\n\nThis system is bistable, possessing two stable equilibria ($x=0$ and $x=1$) and one unstable equilibrium ($x=\\theta$). The unstable equilibrium $x=\\theta$ functions as a tipping point, or separatrix. It divides the state space $[0,1]$ into two basins of attraction.\n\n- The basin of attraction for the $x^\\star=0$ equilibrium (extinction of the behavior) is the interval $[0, \\theta)$. For any initial condition $x_0 \\in [0, \\theta)$, the dynamics dictate $\\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x)  0$, causing $x(t)$ to decrease and asymptotically approach $x_\\infty = 0$.\n\n- The basin of attraction for the $x^\\star=1$ equilibrium (full adoption) is the interval $(\\theta, 1]$. For any initial condition $x_0 \\in (\\theta, 1]$, the dynamics dictate $\\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x)  0$, causing $x(t)$ to increase and asymptotically approach $x_\\infty = 1$.\n\n- If the system starts exactly at the tipping point, $x_0 = \\theta$, it will theoretically remain there for all time, as $\\frac{dx}{dt}=f(\\theta)=0$.\n\nTipping is characterized by this acute sensitivity to the initial condition relative to the threshold $\\theta$. An infinitesimal perturbation that pushes the system off the threshold determines its long-term fate. If $x(0) = \\theta + \\epsilon$ for an infinitesimally small $\\epsilon  0$, the system will move towards $x=1$. If $x(0) = \\theta - \\epsilon$, it will move towards $x=0$.\n\n**3. Algorithm Design**\n\nThe task is to design an algorithm that takes $(r, \\theta, x_0)$ and returns the asymptotic state $x_\\infty$ and the sign of the Jacobian at that state, $\\operatorname{sign}(f'(x_\\infty))$. The analysis above directly yields the following algorithm:\n\n1.  Compare the initial adoption fraction $x_0$ with the tipping threshold $\\theta$.\n\n2.  If $x_0  \\theta$:\n    The system is in the basin of attraction of the stable equilibrium $x^\\star = 0$.\n    - The asymptotic level is $x_\\infty = 0.0$.\n    - The Jacobian at this equilibrium is $f'(0) = -r\\theta  0$. Its sign is $-1$.\n    - The output is $[0.0, -1]$.\n\n3.  If $x_0  \\theta$:\n    The system is in the basin of attraction of the stable equilibrium $x^\\star = 1$.\n    - The asymptotic level is $x_\\infty = 1.0$.\n    - The Jacobian at this equilibrium is $f'(1) = r(\\theta-1)  0$. Its sign is $-1$.\n    - The output is $[1.0, -1]$.\n\n4.  If $x_0 = \\theta$:\n    The system starts at and remains on the unstable equilibrium $x^\\star = \\theta$.\n    - The asymptotic level is $x_\\infty = \\theta$.\n    - The Jacobian at this equilibrium is $f'(\\theta) = r\\theta(1-\\theta)  0$. Its sign is $+1$.\n    - The output is $[\\theta, 1]$.\n\nThe parameter $r$ influences the speed of convergence to the equilibria but, as long as $r0$, it does not alter the locations of the equilibria, their stability, or the basins of attraction. The algorithm's logic is therefore independent of the value of $r$. The inclusion of the value $0$ in the specified set $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ for the sign of the Jacobian would correspond to a marginally stable equilibrium where $f'(x^\\star)=0$. However, given the problem's constraints $r0$ and $\\theta \\in (0,1)$, none of the three equilibria can be marginal.\n\n**4. Implementation**\n\nThe algorithm is implemented in Python as requested.
