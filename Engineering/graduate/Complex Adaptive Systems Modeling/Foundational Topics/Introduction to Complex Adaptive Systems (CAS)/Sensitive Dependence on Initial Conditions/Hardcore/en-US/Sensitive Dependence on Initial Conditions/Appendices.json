Your final answer must be the symbolic value of the LLE. No rounding is required. Express logarithms using the natural logarithm.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the Largest Lyapunov Exponent (LLE) for the doubling map and a deduction of Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions (SDIC) from this result.\n\nFirst, we calculate the LLE. The system's evolution is governed by the discrete-time map $f:[0,1) \\to [0,1)$ defined as the doubling map, $f(x) = 2x \\pmod 1$. This function can be expressed in a piecewise linear form:\n$$\nf(x) =\n\\begin{cases}\n2x  \\text{if } 0 \\le x  \\frac{1}{2} \\\\\n2x-1  \\text{if } \\frac{1}{2} \\le x  1\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe LLE, $\\lambda(x_0)$, for a trajectory $\\{x_k\\}_{k\\geq0}$ originating from an initial condition $x_0$ is defined by the formula:\n$$\n\\lambda(x_0) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\ln\\big|f'(x_k)\\big| \\quad \\text{where } x_k = f^k(x_0)\n$$\nTo evaluate this expression, we first need the derivative of the map, $f'(x)$. By differentiating the piecewise components of $f(x)$, we obtain:\n$$\nf'(x) = 2, \\quad \\text{for } x \\in [0,1) \\setminus \\{\\tfrac{1}{2}\\}\n$$\nThe derivative is undefined at the point $x=\\frac{1}{2}$, where the function $f(x)$ has a jump discontinuity in its representation on the interval $[0,1)$. For any point $x_k$ in a trajectory where the derivative is defined, its absolute value is $|f'(x_k)|=2$.\n\nThe LLE formula involves an average over the entire trajectory. For this average to be well-defined, the trajectory must avoid the point of non-differentiability, $x=\\frac{1}{2}$. The set of initial conditions $x_0$ for which the orbit $\\{x_k\\}$ eventually includes the point $\\frac{1}{2}$ is precisely the set of dyadic rationals (numbers of the form $\\frac{p}{2^q}$ for integers $p, q$). This set is countable and has a Lebesgue measure of zero. For almost all initial conditions $x_0 \\in [0,1)$, including all irrational numbers, the trajectory $x_k = f^k(x_0)$ will never land on the point $x=\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nConsequently, for a typical trajectory, the term $|f'(x_k)|$ in the sum is equal to $2$ for all $k \\ge 0$. We can now substitute this into the definition of the LLE:\n$$\n\\lambda(x_0) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\ln(2)\n$$\nThe summation term is a sum of $n$ identical constants:\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\ln(2) = n \\ln(2)\n$$\nPlacing this result back into the limit expression gives the value of the LLE:\n$$\n\\lambda(x_0) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{n} (n \\ln(2)) = \\ln(2)\n$$\nThus, the LLE for the doubling map is $\\lambda = \\ln(2)$ for almost all initial conditions $x_0$.\n\nNext, we deduce SDIC from the calculated LLE. SDIC is the property that initially close trajectories diverge over time. The LLE quantifies the average exponential rate of this divergence. Consider two nearby initial conditions, $x_0$ and $y_0 = x_0 + \\delta_0$, where $\\delta_0$ represents a very small initial separation. The separation after one iteration is $\\delta_1 = f(y_0) - f(x_0)$. Using a first-order Taylor expansion (linearization) for small $\\delta_0$, we have $f(x_0 + \\delta_0) \\approx f(x_0) + f'(x_0)\\delta_0$. This leads to the linearized separation dynamics $\\delta_1 \\approx f'(x_0)\\delta_0$.\n\nAfter $n$ iterations, the separation $\\delta_n = y_n - x_n$ is approximately:\n$$\n\\delta_n \\approx \\left(\\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} f'(x_k)\\right) \\delta_0\n$$\nTaking the absolute value, we get the magnitude of the separation:\n$$\n|\\delta_n| \\approx |\\delta_0| \\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} |f'(x_k)|\n$$\nBy taking the natural logarithm, dividing by $n$, and considering the limit as $n \\to \\infty$, we recover the definition of the LLE:\n$$\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{n} \\ln\\left(\\frac{|\\delta_n|}{|\\delta_0|}\\right) = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \\ln|f'(x_k)| = \\lambda\n$$\nThis limiting relationship implies that for large $n$, the separation magnitude evolves according to $|\\delta_n| \\approx |\\delta_0| \\exp(\\lambda n)$. Since we found $\\lambda = \\ln(2)  0$, the separation grows exponentially:\n$$\n|\\delta_n| \\approx |\\delta_0| \\exp(n \\ln(2)) = |\\delta_0| 2^n\n$$\nA positive LLE indicates exponential divergence of nearby trajectories, which is the defining characteristic of SDIC. The problem defines SDIC as: for any sufficiently small initial separation $d_0 = d(x_0, y_0)  0$ and any tolerance $\\varepsilon \\in (0, \\frac{1}{2})$, there exists a finite time $n$ such that $d(x_n, y_n) \\ge \\varepsilon$.\n\nThe exponential growth $|\\delta_n| \\approx d_0 2^n$ (where $d_0$ is the initial distance) ensures that any microscopic separation $d_0$ is amplified to a macroscopic scale $\\varepsilon$ in a finite time. We can estimate this time $n$ by solving for when the linearized separation reaches $\\varepsilon$: $d_0 2^n = \\varepsilon$, which yields $n = \\log_2(\\varepsilon/d_0)$. As $d_0$ is small, $\\varepsilon/d_0  1$, and $n$ is a finite positive number. While the linear approximation is only valid for small separations, the exponential tendency ensures that the separation will grow until it is no longer small and becomes a significant fraction of the state space diameter. Therefore, the positive LLE of $\\lambda = \\ln(2)$ directly implies SDIC.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the largest Lyapunov exponent for the logistic map $f_{4}(x) = 4x(1-x)$ on the interval $[0,1]$. We are instructed to solve this by first establishing a conjugacy with the angle-doubling map, then deriving the invariant measure, and finally evaluating the integral for the Lyapunov exponent expressed as a space average. The problem statement provides the crucial assumptions that the Sinai–Ruelle–Bowen (SRB) measure exists and that the Birkhoff Ergodic Theorem holds, which justifies equating the time-average definition of the Lyapunov exponent with its space average over the invariant measure.\n\nFirst, we establish the conjugacy between the logistic map $f_4(x)=4x(1-x)$ and the angle-doubling map $T(\\theta)=2\\theta \\pmod 1$ on the circle represented by the interval $[0,1)$. The problem suggests a change of variables $x=\\varphi(\\theta)$ built from trigonometric identities. Consider the substitution $x = \\varphi(\\theta) = \\sin^2(\\pi\\theta)$ for $\\theta\\in[0,1]$. This map correctly maps the interval $[0,1]$ to $[0,1]$. We verify the conjugacy relation $f_4(\\varphi(\\theta)) = \\varphi(T(\\theta))$.\nThe left side is:\n$$\nf_4(\\varphi(\\theta)) = f_4(\\sin^2(\\pi\\theta)) = 4\\sin^2(\\pi\\theta)(1-\\sin^2(\\pi\\theta)) = 4\\sin^2(\\pi\\theta)\\cos^2(\\pi\\theta) = (2\\sin(\\pi\\theta)\\cos(\\pi\\theta))^2 = (\\sin(2\\pi\\theta))^2\n$$\nThe right side is $\\varphi(T(\\theta)) = \\sin^2(\\pi T(\\theta)) = \\sin^2(\\pi(2\\theta \\pmod 1))$.\nIf $\\theta \\in [0, 1/2)$, then $T(\\theta)=2\\theta$, so $\\varphi(T(\\theta)) = \\sin^2(2\\pi\\theta)$.\nIf $\\theta \\in [1/2, 1)$, then $T(\\theta)=2\\theta-1$, so $\\varphi(T(\\theta)) = \\sin^2(\\pi(2\\theta-1)) = \\sin^2(2\\pi\\theta-\\pi)$. Using the trigonometric identity $\\sin(\\alpha-\\pi)=-\\sin(\\alpha)$, we have $\\sin^2(2\\pi\\theta-\\pi) = (-\\sin(2\\pi\\theta))^2 = \\sin^2(2\\pi\\theta)$.\nIn both cases, the right side evaluates to $\\sin^2(2\\pi\\theta) = (\\sin(2\\pi\\theta))^2$. Thus, the conjugacy is established.\n\nNext, we justify that the Lebesgue measure $d\\theta$ on $[0,1)$ is invariant and ergodic for $T(\\theta)$. A measure $\\mu$ is invariant if for any measurable set $A$, $\\mu(T^{-1}(A))=\\mu(A)$. Let $A=[a,b) \\subset [0,1)$. The preimages of $A$ under $T$ are the set of $\\theta$ such that $2\\theta \\pmod 1 \\in [a,b)$. This implies $2\\theta \\in [a,b)$ or $2\\theta-1 \\in [a,b)$, which in turn gives $\\theta \\in [a/2, b/2)$ or $\\theta \\in [(a+1)/2, (b+1)/2)$. The total length of the preimage set is $(b/2-a/2) + ((b+1)/2 - (a+1)/2) = (b-a)/2 + (b-a)/2 = b-a$. Thus, the Lebesgue measure is invariant. For ergodicity, we show that any $T$-invariant function $g(\\theta)$ is constant almost everywhere. Let $g(\\theta) = \\sum_{k\\in\\mathbb{Z}} c_k \\exp(2\\pi i k \\theta)$ be the Fourier series of an $L^1$ function. The invariance condition $g(T(\\theta))=g(\\theta)$ implies $\\sum_{k\\in\\mathbb{Z}} c_k \\exp(2\\pi i k (2\\theta)) = \\sum_{k\\in\\mathbb{Z}} c_k \\exp(2\\pi i k \\theta)$. By uniqueness of Fourier coefficients, we must have $c_{2k}=c_k$ for all $k\\in\\mathbb{Z}$. Iterating this relation implies $c_k = c_{k/2} = c_{k/4}=\\dots$. For this sequence to converge (as required for $L^1$ functions), $c_k$ must be $0$ for all $k \\neq 0$. Thus, $g(\\theta)=c_0$, a constant, proving ergodicity.\n\nThe invariant probability measure for $f_4$ on $[0,1]$, denoted by $\\rho(x)dx$, can be derived from the invariant measure for $T$, which is the uniform measure $d\\theta$ on $[0,1)$. The density $\\rho(x)$ is related to the uniform density $\\rho_\\theta(\\theta)=1$ via the change of variables formula for densities. For a given $x\\in(0,1)$, there are two preimages under $\\varphi(\\theta)=\\sin^2(\\pi\\theta)$, so the conservation of probability requires $\\rho(x)|dx| = \\rho_\\theta(\\theta_1)|d\\theta_1| + \\rho_\\theta(\\theta_2)|d\\theta_2|$. Formally, $\\rho(x) = \\sum_{y \\in \\varphi^{-1}(x)} \\frac{\\rho_\\theta(y)}{|\\varphi'(y)|}$.\nThe derivative is $\\varphi'(\\theta) = \\frac{d}{d\\theta}\\sin^2(\\pi\\theta) = 2\\sin(\\pi\\theta)\\cos(\\pi\\theta)\\pi = \\pi\\sin(2\\pi\\theta)$.\nIn terms of $x$, $|\\varphi'(\\theta)| = \\pi|2\\sin(\\pi\\theta)\\cos(\\pi\\theta)| = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\sin^2(\\pi\\theta)}\\sqrt{1-\\sin^2(\\pi\\theta)} = 2\\pi\\sqrt{x(1-x)}$.\nFor any $x \\in (0,1)$, there are two preimages $\\theta_1, \\theta_2 \\in (0,1)$, and since $\\rho_\\theta(\\theta)=1$ and $|\\varphi'(\\theta)|$ depends only on $x$, we have:\n$$\n\\rho(x) = \\frac{1}{|\\varphi'(\\theta_1)|} + \\frac{1}{|\\varphi'(\\theta_2)|} = \\frac{2}{2\\pi\\sqrt{x(1-x)}} = \\frac{1}{\\pi\\sqrt{x(1-x)}}.\n$$\nThis is the density of the arcsine distribution. Its integral over $[0,1]$ is $\\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{\\pi\\sqrt{x(1-x)}}dx = 1$, confirming it as a valid probability density.\n\nFinally, we evaluate the Lyapunov exponent $\\lambda$ using the provided space-average integral:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\int_{0}^{1}\\rho(x)\\,\\ln\\big|f_{4}'(x)\\big|\\,dx.\n$$\nThe derivative of $f_4(x)$ is $f_4'(x)=4(1-2x)$. Substituting $\\rho(x)$ and $f_4'(x)$:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\ln|4(1-2x)|}{\\pi\\sqrt{x(1-x)}}dx.\n$$\nWe can split the logarithm: $\\ln|4(1-2x)| = \\ln(4) + \\ln|1-2x|$. The integral becomes the sum of two parts:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{\\ln(4)}{\\pi}\\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x(1-x)}}dx + \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\ln|1-2x|}{\\sqrt{x(1-x)}}dx.\n$$\nThe first integral is related to the normalization of our density $\\rho(x)$: $\\int_0^1 \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x(1-x)}}dx = \\pi$. So the first term is $\\frac{\\ln(4)}{\\pi}\\cdot\\pi = \\ln(4) = 2\\ln(2)$.\n\nFor the second integral, let $I_2 = \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\int_0^1 \\frac{\\ln|1-2x|}{\\sqrt{x(1-x)}}dx$. The integrand is symmetric about $x=1/2$, so we can write the integral as $I_2 = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\int_0^{1/2} \\frac{\\ln(1-2x)}{\\sqrt{x(1-x)}}dx$, where we have also removed the absolute value since $1-2x0$ for $x \\in [0, 1/2)$.\nWe use the substitution $x=\\sin^2(u)$, for which $dx=2\\sin(u)\\cos(u)du$. The limits change from $x=0, 1/2$ to $u=0, \\pi/4$.\nThe integrand transforms as: $1-2x = 1-2\\sin^2(u) = \\cos(2u)$ and $\\sqrt{x(1-x)} = \\sin(u)\\cos(u)$ for $u\\in[0,\\pi/2]$.\n$$\nI_2 = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\int_0^{\\pi/4} \\frac{\\ln(\\cos(2u))}{\\sin(u)\\cos(u)} (2\\sin(u)\\cos(u))du = \\frac{4}{\\pi}\\int_0^{\\pi/4} \\ln(\\cos(2u))du.\n$$\nLet $v=2u$, so $dv=2du$. The limits change to $v=0, \\pi/2$.\n$$\nI_2 = \\frac{4}{\\pi}\\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\ln(\\cos(v)) \\frac{dv}{2} = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\ln(\\cos(v))dv.\n$$\nThis is a standard definite integral. Let $J = \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\ln(\\cos(v))dv$. Using the property $\\int_0^a f(x)dx = \\int_0^a f(a-x)dx$, we also have $J = \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\ln(\\sin(v))dv$.\nAdding these two forms gives:\n$$\n2J = \\int_0^{\\pi/2} (\\ln(\\sin(v)) + \\ln(\\cos(v)))dv = \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\ln(\\sin(v)\\cos(v))dv = \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\sin(2v)}{2}\\right)dv\n$$\n$$\n2J = \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\ln(\\sin(2v))dv - \\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\ln(2)dv\n$$\nThe first term on the right, with substitution $w=2v$, becomes $\\frac{1}{2}\\int_0^\\pi \\ln(\\sin(w))dw$. Due to the symmetry of $\\sin(w)$ about $w=\\pi/2$, this is $\\frac{1}{2}(2\\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\ln(\\sin(w))dw) = J$. The second term is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\ln(2)$.\nSo, $2J = J - \\frac{\\pi}{2}\\ln(2)$, which implies $J = -\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\ln(2)$.\nSubstituting this value back into the expression for $I_2$:\n$$\nI_2 = \\frac{2}{\\pi} J = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\ln(2)\\right) = -\\ln(2).\n$$\nFinally, we combine the two parts to find the Lyapunov exponent:\n$$\n\\lambda = 2\\ln(2) + (-\\ln(2)) = \\ln(2).\n$$\nThis result is consistent with the general theorem that conjugate maps possess the same Lyapunov exponents, as the exponent for the angle-doubling map $T(\\theta)$ is $\\ln|T'(\\theta)|=\\ln(2)$ everywhere except a set of measure zero.",

Let us divide the total integration time $T$ into $k$ small, equal intervals of duration $\\Delta t$, such that $T = k\\Delta t$. The ratio of the norms can be expressed as a product of growth factors over each small interval:\n$$\n\\frac{\\|\\delta x(T)\\|}{\\|\\delta x(0)\\|} = \\frac{\\|\\delta x(k\\Delta t)\\|}{\\|\\delta x(0)\\|} = \\left(\\frac{\\|\\delta x(k\\Delta t)\\|}{\\|\\delta x((k-1)\\Delta t)\\|}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\|\\delta x((k-1)\\Delta t)\\|}{\\|\\delta x((k-2)\\Delta t)\\|}\\right) \\dots \\left(\\frac{\\|\\delta x(\\Delta t)\\|}{\\|\\delta x(0)\\|}\\right)\n$$\nLet us define $t_i = i\\Delta t$. If we denote the perturbation vector at time $t_{i-1}$ as $\\delta x(t_{i-1})$ and the vector it evolves into at time $t_i$ as $\\delta x(t_i)$, then we could write this as a product of local growth factors. However, the magnitude of the vector would still grow or shrink uncontrollably.\n\nThe standard and correct procedure introduces a **renormalization** step. Let $\\delta\\hat{x}_{i-1}$ be a unit vector representing the direction of the perturbation at the beginning of the $i$-th interval (at time $t_{i-1}$).\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n$1$. Initialize the main system with $x(0)$ and the tangent vector with a random unit vector $\\delta\\hat{x}_0$ (i.e., $\\|\\delta\\hat{x}_0\\| = 1$). Initialize an accumulator for the logarithmic growth, $S=0$.\n$2$. For each step $i = 1, 2, \\dots, k$:\n    a. Simultaneously integrate the system equation $\\dot{x} = f(x)$ and the variational equation $\\dot{\\delta x} = Df(x(t))\\,\\delta x$ over the time interval $[t_{i-1}, t_i]$. The initial condition for the variational equation is $\\delta x(t_{i-1}) = \\delta\\hat{x}_{i-1}$. Let the solution at the end of the interval be $\\delta x'$.\n    b. Calculate the norm of this evolved vector, $s_i = \\|\\delta x'\\|$. This value $s_i$ represents the factor by which the length of the perturbation vector was stretched during the interval $\\Delta t$.\n    c. Add the logarithm of this stretch factor to the accumulator: $S \\leftarrow S + \\ln(s_i)$.\n    d. Renormalize the vector to have unit length for the next iteration: $\\delta\\hat{x}_i = \\delta x' / s_i$. This step is crucial. It resets the magnitude to $1$ while preserving the vector's direction, thus preventing overflow/underflow.\n$3$. After $k$ steps, the total time elapsed is $T = k\\Delta t$. The maximal Lyapunov exponent is estimated by the average logarithmic growth rate:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\max} \\approx \\frac{S}{T} = \\frac{1}{k\\Delta t} \\sum_{i=1}^k \\ln(s_i)\n$$\nThis procedure is numerically stable. Furthermore, according to Oseledec's Multiplicative Ergodic Theorem, for a typical starting vector $\\delta\\hat{x}_0$, repeated application of the linearized flow and renormalization will cause the direction of the vector $\\delta\\hat{x}_i$ to align with the most unstable direction in the tangent space, known as the first Oseledec subspace. Therefore, the measured growth factors $s_i$ correspond to stretching along this dominant direction, and their geometric mean (which corresponds to the arithmetic mean of their logarithms) correctly yields the maximal Lyapunov exponent.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A.** This option describes the procedure derived above.\n- It correctly specifies initializing a unit vector, integrating over intervals $\\Delta t$, and calculating the stretch factor $s_i = \\|\\delta x(i\\Delta t)\\|$.\n- It correctly describes the renormalization step $\\delta x(i\\Delta t) \\leftarrow \\delta x(i\\Delta t)/s_i$.\n- It correctly specifies accumulating the sum of logarithms, $S \\leftarrow S + \\ln(s_i)$.\n- It correctly gives the final estimator $\\lambda_{\\max} \\approx S/T$.\n- The explanation is also flawless: renormalization prevents overflow/underflow, repeated application aligns the vector with the most expanding Oseledec subspace, and the procedure correctly sums the local logarithmic growth rates along this dominant direction to find the correct asymptotic average.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B.** This option proposes estimating $\\lambda_{\\max}$ using the arithmetic mean of rates like $\\frac{\\|\\delta x(i\\Delta t)\\| - \\|\\delta x((i-1)\\Delta t)\\|}{\\Delta t}$. This is incorrect. The growth of a perturbation in a chaotic system is exponential, so its rate of growth must be characterized logarithmically. The expression given is an approximation of a linear rate of change, not an exponential growth rate. The correct quantity to average is the logarithmic growth rate, $\\frac{1}{\\Delta t}\\ln(\\|\\delta x(i\\Delta t)\\|/\\|\\delta x((i-1)\\Delta t)\\|)$. The explanation that renormalization \"reduces measurement noise\" is also vague and misses the primary point of preventing catastrophic numerical failure.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C.** This option suggests using the definitional formula directly, without renormalization. As explained in the derivation, this approach is numerically infeasible for any system with a non-zero Lyapunov exponent due to overflow or underflow. The justification provided is also fundamentally incorrect. The trace of the Jacobian, $\\text{tr}(Df(x(t)))$, relates to the rate of change of phase-space volume elements. By Liouville's theorem extended to nonlinear flows, the sum of all Lyapunov exponents is equal to the time-average of the trace of the Jacobian: $\\sum_{j=1}^n \\lambda_j = \\lim_{T\\to\\infty} \\frac{1}{T}\\int_0^T \\text{tr}(Df(x(\\tau))) d\\tau$. This governs volume evolution, not the stretching of a single vector, which is determined by $\\lambda_{\\max}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D.** This option suggests that $\\lambda_{\\max}$ can be estimated by averaging the largest instantaneous eigenvalue (or more precisely, the largest real part of any eigenvalue, the spectral abscissa) of the Jacobian matrix $Df(x(t))$ along the trajectory. This is a common misconception. The maximal Lyapunov exponent is a property of the non-autonomous linear system $\\dot{\\delta x} = A(t)\\delta x$ where $A(t) = Df(x(t))$. The asymptotic growth rate of solutions to such a system is not, in general, the time-average of the largest eigenvalue of $A(t)$. The reason is that the eigenvectors of $A(t)$ rotate as the system evolves along the trajectory. The perturbation vector $\\delta x$ does not have sufficient time to align with the instantaneous most expanding direction before that direction itself changes. The long-term growth is a result of the cumulative, multiplicative action of the flow, which is correctly captured by the procedure in option A, not by averaging local eigenvalues.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",
