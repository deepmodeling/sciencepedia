            "solution": "This problem consists of two parts. The first is an explanatory task concerning fundamental concepts in graph theory, and the second is a computational task in enumerative combinatorics. I will address each in turn after validating the problem statement.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **Context**: Erdős–Rényi (ER) model $G(n,p)$.\n- **Concepts to Explain**:\n    1. The distinction between labeled graphs (on a vertex set $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$) and unlabeled graphs (isomorphism classes).\n    2. The role of automorphisms in relating these two concepts.\n- **Computational Task**:\n    - **Unlabeled Graph $H$**: A graph on $n=12$ vertices.\n    - **Structure of $H$**: The disjoint union of:\n        - $3$ copies of the path on three vertices ($P_3$).\n        - $1$ copy of the complete graph on two vertices ($K_2$).\n        - $1$ copy of an isolated vertex ($K_1$).\n    - **Objective**: Compute the number of distinct labeled graphs on the vertex set $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 12\\}$ that are isomorphic to $H$.\n    - **Output Format**: An exact integer.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, resting on established principles of graph theory and enumerative combinatorics. The mention of the $G(n,p)$ model provides a relevant context for the importance of distinguishing between labeled and unlabeled graph spaces, but the problem itself is a standard exercise in graph enumeration. The definition of the graph $H$ is precise and self-consistent; the sum of the vertices of its components ($3 \\times 3 + 1 \\times 2 + 1 \\times 1$) correctly equals the total number of vertices specified ($n=12$). The problem is well-posed, with all necessary information provided to arrive at a unique, verifiable solution. The terminology is standard and unambiguous. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Part 1: Conceptual Explanation\n\nA **labeled graph** $G=(V, E)$ is formally defined by a fixed, distinguishable set of vertices $V$, typically taken as the set of integers $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$, and a set $E$ of $2$-element subsets of $V$, representing the edges. Two labeled graphs on the same vertex set $V$, say $G_1=(V, E_1)$ and $G_2=(V, E_2)$, are considered distinct if and only if their edge sets are not identical, i.e., $E_1 \\neq E_2$. For a set of $n$ vertices, there are $\\binom{n}{2}$ possible edges, and since each can either be included or not, there are $2^{\\binom{n}{2}}$ distinct labeled graphs on $n$ vertices.\n\nAn **unlabeled graph**, by contrast, is an abstraction that captures only the topological structure, disregarding the specific identities of the vertices. Its formal definition relies on the concept of graph isomorphism. Two labeled graphs, $G_1=(V_1, E_1)$ and $G_2=(V_2, E_2)$, are **isomorphic** if there exists a bijective function $\\phi: V_1 \\to V_2$, called an isomorphism, that preserves adjacency. That is, for any pair of vertices $u, v \\in V_1$, the edge $\\{u, v\\}$ is in $E_1$ if and only if the edge $\\{\\phi(u), \\phi(v)\\}$ is in $E_2$. Isomorphism defines an equivalence relation on the set of all labeled graphs. An unlabeled graph is precisely an equivalence class under this relation. All graphs within an isomorphism class share the same abstract structure.\n\nThe bridge between the world of labeled graphs and unlabeled graphs is provided by **automorphisms**. An automorphism of a graph $G=(V, E)$ is an isomorphism from $G$ to itself—a permutation $\\sigma$ of the vertex set $V$ that preserves the edge set. The set of all such automorphisms for a graph $G$ forms a group under the operation of function composition, called the **automorphism group** of $G$, denoted $\\text{Aut}(G)$. The size of this group, $|\\text{Aut}(G)|$, quantifies the structural symmetry of the graph. A completely asymmetric graph has only the identity automorphism ($|\\text{Aut}(G)|=1$), while highly symmetric graphs like the complete graph $K_n$ have a large automorphism group ($|\\text{Aut}(K_n)| = n!$).\n\nTo find the number of distinct labeled graphs on $n$ vertices that correspond to a single unlabeled graph $H$, we can reason as follows. Start with one specific labeled realization of $H$, say $G_0$, on the vertex set $\\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$. We can generate other labeled graphs by permuting the vertex labels. There are $n!$ such permutations. However, if a permutation $\\sigma$ is an automorphism of $G_0$, applying it to the vertices of $G_0$ results in the very same labeled graph. More generally, two permutations $\\pi_1$ and $\\pi_2$ yield the same labeled graph if and only if $\\pi_1(G_0) = \\pi_2(G_0)$, which is equivalent to $\\pi_2^{-1}\\pi_1$ being an automorphism of $G_0$. This implies that for any given labeled realization, there are exactly $|\\text{Aut}(G_0)|$ permutations that will produce it. By the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem, the total number of permutations ($n!$) is the product of the number of distinct labeled graphs (the size of the orbit) and the number of symmetries of any one of these graphs (the size of the stabilizer, $|\\text{Aut}(H)|$). Thus, the number of distinct labeled graphs on $n$ vertices that are isomorphic to an unlabeled graph $H$ is given by the formula:\n$$ \\text{Number of labeled realizations} = \\frac{n!}{|\\text{Aut}(H)|} $$\n\n### Part 2: Calculation\n\nThe problem asks for the number of labeled graphs on the vertex set $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 12\\}$ that are isomorphic to the unlabeled graph $H$, which is the disjoint union $3P_3 \\cup K_2 \\cup K_1$. Here $n=12$. Following the formula derived above, we must first compute the size of the automorphism group of $H$, $|\\text{Aut}(H)|$.\n\nAn automorphism of a disjoint union of graphs must map connected components to isomorphic connected components. The structure of $H$ consists of three non-isomorphic component types: $P_3$, $K_2$, and $K_1$. There are $m_1 = 3$ identical copies of $C_1 = P_3$, $m_2 = 1$ copy of $C_2 = K_2$, and $m_3 = 1$ copy of $C_3 = K_1$.\n\nThe size of the automorphism group of such a disjoint union is given by the product of the sizes of the automorphism groups for each class of isomorphic components. For a class of $m$ identical components $C$, the contribution to the group size is $|\\text{Aut}(C)|^m \\cdot m!$. The first term accounts for internal symmetries within each of the $m$ components, and the $m!$ term accounts for the permutations of the $m$ identical components themselves.\nTherefore, the size of the automorphism group of $H$ is:\n$$|\\text{Aut}(H)| = \\left(|\\text{Aut}(P_3)|^{3} \\cdot 3!\\right) \\cdot \\left(|\\text{Aut}(K_2)|^{1} \\cdot 1!\\right) \\cdot \\left(|\\text{Aut}(K_1)|^{1} \\cdot 1!\\right)$$\n\nNext, we determine the size of the automorphism group for each individual component type:\n1.  **$|\\text{Aut}(P_3)|$**: The path on three vertices has a central vertex of degree $2$ and two end vertices of degree $1$. Any automorphism must fix the central vertex and can only permute the two end vertices. Thus, there are $2$ automorphisms (the identity and the swap of the ends). $|\\text{Aut}(P_3)|=2$.\n2.  **$|\\text{Aut}(K_2)|$**: The complete graph on two vertices consists of two vertices of degree $1$. They are structurally indistinguishable and can be swapped. So, $|\\text{Aut}(K_2)|=2$.\n3.  **$|\\text{Aut}(K_1)|$**: The graph with a single vertex has only the trivial (identity) automorphism. So, $|\\text{Aut}(K_1)|=1$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the formula for $|\\text{Aut}(H)|$:\n$$|\\text{Aut}(H)| = (2^3 \\cdot 3!) \\cdot (2^1 \\cdot 1!) \\cdot (1^1 \\cdot 1!) = (8 \\cdot 6) \\cdot (2 \\cdot 1) \\cdot (1 \\cdot 1) = 48 \\cdot 2 = 96$$\n\nThe size of the automorphism group of $H$ is $96$.\nNow, we can compute the number of distinct labeled realizations of $H$ on $12$ vertices:\n$$ \\text{Number of labeled graphs} = \\frac{n!}{|\\text{Aut}(H)|} = \\frac{12!}{96} $$\nThe value of $12!$ is $479,001,600$.\n$$ \\frac{12!}{96} = \\frac{479,001,600}{96} $$\nTo simplify the calculation:\n$$ \\frac{12!}{96} = \\frac{12!}{12 \\cdot 8} = \\frac{11! \\cdot 12}{12 \\cdot 8} = \\frac{11!}{8} $$\nSince $11! = 39,916,800$, we have:\n$$ \\frac{39,916,800}{8} = 4,989,600 $$\nThus, there are $4,989,600$ distinct labeled graphs on the vertex set $\\{1, 2, \\dots, 12\\}$ that are isomorphic to $H$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the degree distributions for a fixed vertex $v$ in the $G(n,p)$ and $G(n,M)$ random graph models, followed by a comparison of their variances.\n\nFirst, we analyze the distribution of the degree $D_p$ of a fixed vertex $v$ in the $G(n,p)$ model. In this model, the graph has $n$ vertices, and each of the $\\binom{n}{2}$ possible edges is included independently with a probability $p$. For a specific vertex $v$, there are $n-1$ potential edges connecting it to the other $n-1$ vertices. The existence of each of these $n-1$ edges is an independent Bernoulli trial with success probability $p$. The degree $D_p$ is the total number of successful trials. Therefore, the distribution of $D_p$ is a binomial distribution with parameters $n-1$ and $p$.\n\n$D_p \\sim \\mathrm{Binomial}(n-1, p)$\n\nThe probability mass function (PMF) for $D_p$ is given by:\n$$P(D_p = k) = \\binom{n-1}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-1-k}$$\nfor $k \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$.

Thus, the variance of $D_p$ is:\n$$\\mathrm{Var}(D_p) = (n-1)p(1-p)$$\n\nNext, we analyze the distribution of the degree $D_M$ of a fixed vertex $v$ in the $G(n,M)$ model. In this model, exactly $M$ edges are chosen uniformly at random without replacement from the total set of $N_{\\text{total}} = \\binom{n}{2}$ possible edges. This is a classic sampling without replacement scenario. To find the distribution of $D_M$, we can model it using a hypergeometric distribution.\n\nThe population consists of all $N_{\\text{total}} = \\binom{n}{2}$ possible edges. We can partition this population into two groups:\n1.  The $K = n-1$ edges that are incident to vertex $v$.\n2.  The $N_{\\text{total}} - K = \\binom{n}{2} - (n-1)$ edges that are not incident to vertex $v$.\n\nWe draw a sample of size $M$ (the total number of edges in the graph) from this population. The degree $D_M$ of vertex $v$ is the number of edges from the first group (successes) that are included in our sample.\nTherefore, the distribution of $D_M$ is a hypergeometric distribution with population size $N_{\\text{total}} = \\binom{n}{2}$, number of successes in the population $K = n-1$, and sample size $m = M$.\n\nThe PMF for $D_M$ is given by:\n$$P(D_M = k) = \\frac{\\binom{K}{k}\\binom{N_{\\text{total}}-K}{m-k}}{\\binom{N_{\\text{total}}}{m}} = \\frac{\\binom{n-1}{k}\\binom{\\binom{n}{2}-(n-1)}{M-k}}{\\binom{\\binom{n}{2}}{M}}$$\nfor $k \\in \\{\\max(0, M-(\\binom{n}{2}-(n-1))), \\dots, \\min(n-1, M)\\}$.

The expected number of edges in $G(n,p)$ is $\\binom{n}{2}p$. The number of edges in $G(n,M)$ is fixed at $M$. Setting these equal gives $M = \\binom{n}{2}p$, which leads to the definition $p^{\\star} \\equiv \\frac{M}{\\binom{n}{2}}$.

            "solution": "The problem is scientifically sound and well-posed, representing a standard, albeit non-trivial, calculation in the theory of random graphs.\n\n### Part 1: Conditional Distribution of $T_v$\n\nFirst, we derive the distribution of $T_v$ conditional on the degree of vertex $v$, $D_v$. Let $v$ be a fixed vertex in the graph $G(n,p)$. The degree of $v$, $D_v$, follows a binomial distribution, $D_v \\sim \\text{Bin}(n-1, p)$, as it is the sum of $n-1$ independent Bernoulli trials.\n\nWe condition on the event that $D_v=k$. This means $v$ has exactly $k$ neighbors. Let $N(v)$ be this set of $k$ neighbors. A triangle containing $v$ is formed by $v$ and two of its neighbors, say $i$ and $j$, if the edge $(i,j)$ is present. The number of distinct pairs of vertices $\\{i,j\\}$ in $N(v)$ is $\\binom{k}{2}$. For each such pair, the edge $(i,j)$ exists with probability $p$, independently of all other edges not incident to $v$. The number of triangles $T_v$ is the number of these $\\binom{k}{2}$ potential edges that are present. Therefore, conditional on $D_v=k$, $T_v$ follows a binomial distribution:\n$$T_v | (D_v = k) \\sim \\text{Bin}\\left(\\binom{k}{2}, p\\right)$$\n\n### Part 2: Asymptotic Probability $P(T_v \\ge 2)$\n\nNext, we calculate the asymptotic probability that $v$ participates in at least $2$ triangles, $P(T_v \\ge 2)$. We use the principle of inclusion-exclusion (also known as the method of moments). Let $S_k = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\binom{T_v}{k}\\right]$ be the expected number of unordered $k$-tuples of triangles containing $v$. The probability is given by:\n$$P(T_v \\ge 2) = S_2 - 2S_3 + 3S_4 - \\dots$$\nWe need to compute this probability up to and including terms of order $n^{-2}$.\n\n$S_2 = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\binom{T_v}{2}\\right]$ is the expected number of pairs of triangles containing $v$. We calculate this by enumerating the minimal configurations. A pair of triangles containing $v$ can be formed in two minimal ways.\n\n**Case 1: The two triangles share an edge incident to $v$.**\nThis configuration involves $3$ vertices from $V \\setminus \\{v\\}$, say $\\{i,j,k\\}$, and forms a \"diamond\" graph where the triangles are $\\{v,i,j\\}$ and $\\{v,i,k\\}$. It requires $5$ distinct edges: $\\{(v,i), (v,j), (v,k), (i,j), (i,k)\\}$. The probability for one such specific configuration to exist is $p^5$. The number of such configurations is found by choosing the $3$ vertices in $\\binom{n-1}{3}$ ways, and for each set, choosing the central vertex (like $i$) in $3$ ways. Thus, the contribution to $S_2$ is $3\\binom{n-1}{3}p^5$.\n\n**Case 2: The two triangles share only the vertex $v$.**\nThe triangles are $\\{v,i,j\\}$ and $\\{v,k,l\\}$, where $\\{i,j,k,l\\}$ are $4$ distinct vertices from $V \\setminus \\{v\\}$. This configuration requires $6$ distinct edges, and its probability is $p^6$. The number of ways to choose the $4$ vertices is $\\binom{n-1}{4}$. For each set, there are $3$ ways to partition them into two pairs to form the triangles. The contribution to $S_2$ is $3\\binom{n-1}{4}p^6$.\n\nCombining these cases, $S_2 = 3\\binom{n-1}{3}p^5 + 3\\binom{n-1}{4}p^6$. We substitute $p=c/n$ and expand asymptotically:\nFor the first term:\n$$3\\binom{n-1}{3}p^5 = 3 \\frac{(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)}{6} \\left(\\frac{c}{n}\\right)^5 = \\frac{1}{2}(n^3 - 6n^2 + O(n)) \\frac{c^5}{n^5} = \\frac{c^5}{2n^2} + O(n^{-3})$$\nFor the second term:\n$$3\\binom{n-1}{4}p^6 = 3 \\frac{(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)(n-4)}{24} \\left(\\frac{c}{n}\\right)^6 = \\frac{1}{8}(n^4 - 10n^3 + O(n^2)) \\frac{c^6}{n^6} = \\frac{c^6}{8n^2} + O(n^{-3})$$\nSo, the expansion for $S_2$ is:\n$$S_2 = \\frac{c^5}{2n^2} + \\frac{c^6}{8n^2} + O(n^{-3})$$\nNow we must consider the higher-order terms in the inclusion-exclusion series. The next term involves $S_3 = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\binom{T_v}{3}\\right]$. The leading contribution to $S_3$ comes from the configuration with the fewest edges, which is a $K_4$ subgraph on $\\{v,i,j,k\\}$. This configuration has $6$ edges and contains $3$ triangles involving $v$. The number of ways to choose the $3$ vertices $\\{i,j,k\\}$ is $\\binom{n-1}{3}$. The probability is $p^6$. Thus, the leading contribution to $S_3$ is $\\binom{n-1}{3}p^6 \\approx \\frac{n^3}{6} (\\frac{c}{n})^6 = \\frac{c^6}{6n^3}$.\nSince all contributions to $S_3$ are of order $O(n^{-3})$ or smaller, $S_k = O(n^{-3})$ for all $k \\ge 3$.\nThe full expression for the probability is $P(T_v \\ge 2) = S_2 - 2S_3 + \\dots = S_2 + O(n^{-3})$. The error in approximating $P(T_v \\ge 2)$ by $S_2$ is $O(n^{-3})$, which is $o(n^{-2})$. Therefore, to find the desired expression correct up to and including terms of order $n^{-2}$, we only need the terms of order $n^{-2}$ from $S_2$.\n$$P(T_v \\ge 2) = \\frac{c^5}{2n^2} + \\frac{c^6}{8n^2} + o(n^{-2})$$\nCombining these terms gives the final asymptotic expression.\n$$P(T_v \\ge 2) = \\frac{4c^5 + c^6}{8n^2} + o(n^{-2}) = \\frac{c^5(4+c)}{8n^2} + o(n^{-2})$$\nThe expression that is asymptotically correct up to and including terms of order $n^{-2}$ is this leading part.",
