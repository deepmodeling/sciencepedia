            "problem": "A Sense-Amplifier Based Flip-Flop (SAFF) employs a differential precharge phase that connects each internal dynamic node to the supply. Consider one internal node of such a SAFF that is precharged high by a p-channel Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (pMOS) precharge transistor during a precharge window of duration $T_{\\mathrm{pc}}$. In the worst case at the start of precharge, the node is completely discharged to $0$ V after the preceding evaluate phase. During precharge, the pMOS device is driven strongly on; its source is at the supply voltage $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$, and its drain is at the dynamic node. The node has a total effective capacitance $C_{\\mathrm{int}}$ that lumps the device and interconnect capacitances connected to it. You may model the precharge path as a first-order network consisting of an effective on-resistance in series with the node capacitance, where the effective on-resistance scales inversely with device width. Specifically, the effective on-resistance per unit width of the pMOS device is characterized by the constant $r_{p}^{\\prime}$ (in units of $\\Omega\\cdot\\mu\\mathrm{m}$), so that the on-resistance is $R_{\\mathrm{on}} = r_{p}^{\\prime}/W$, where $W$ is the device width.\n\nThe design requirement is that the node must be fully reset by the end of the precharge window in the sense that its voltage at $t = T_{\\mathrm{pc}}$ satisfies $V_{\\mathrm{node}}(T_{\\mathrm{pc}}) \\ge V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - \\varepsilon$.\n\nGiven the following process and design parameters:\n- Supply voltage $V_{\\mathrm{DD}} = 0.8$ V,\n- Precharge window $T_{\\mathrm{pc}} = 60$ ps,\n- Node capacitance $C_{\\mathrm{int}} = 12$ fF,\n- Effective pMOS on-resistance per unit width $r_{p}^{\\prime} = 8.0 \\times 10^{3}$ $\\Omega\\cdot\\mu\\mathrm{m}$,\n- Allowable residual error $\\varepsilon = 5.0$ mV,\n\nderive from first principles the minimum width $W_{\\min}$ of the pMOS precharge device that guarantees the reset requirement. Then compute its numerical value. Express the final answer for $W_{\\min}$ in micrometers, and round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the minimum width $W_{\\min}$ for a pMOS precharge transistor in a Sense-Amplifier Based Flip-Flop (SAFF). The precharge process is modeled as a first-order RC network, where the internal node capacitance $C_{\\mathrm{int}}$ is charged towards the supply voltage $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$ through the pMOS transistor's effective on-resistance $R_{\\mathrm{on}}$.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- Supply voltage: $V_{\\mathrm{DD}} = 0.8$ V\n- Precharge window duration: $T_{\\mathrm{pc}} = 60$ ps $= 60 \\times 10^{-12}$ s\n- Internal node capacitance: $C_{\\mathrm{int}} = 12$ fF $= 12 \\times 10^{-15}$ F\n- Effective pMOS on-resistance per unit width: $r_{p}^{\\prime} = 8.0 \\times 10^{3}$ $\\Omega\\cdot\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n- Allowable residual voltage error: $\\varepsilon = 5.0$ mV $= 5.0 \\times 10^{-3}$ V\n\nThe on-resistance $R_{\\mathrm{on}}$ is related to the transistor width $W$ by the expression $R_{\\mathrm{on}} = r_{p}^{\\prime}/W$.\n\nThe charging of the capacitor $C_{\\mathrm{int}}$ is described by the differential equation for an RC circuit. Let $V_{\\mathrm{node}}(t)$ be the voltage at the internal node at time $t$. The current charging the capacitor is given by $I(t) = C_{\\mathrm{int}} \\frac{dV_{\\mathrm{node}}(t)}{dt}$. This current is supplied through the resistor $R_{\\mathrm{on}}$ from the supply $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$, so $I(t) = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{node}}(t)}{R_{\\mathrm{on}}}$.\n\nEquating the two expressions for the current gives the first-order linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{on}}C_{\\mathrm{int}} \\frac{dV_{\\mathrm{node}}(t)}{dt} + V_{\\mathrm{node}}(t) = V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$$\nThe time constant of the circuit is $\\tau = R_{\\mathrm{on}}C_{\\mathrm{int}}$. The equation becomes $\\tau \\frac{dV_{\\mathrm{node}}(t)}{dt} + V_{\\mathrm{node}}(t) = V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$.\n\nThe general solution to this differential equation is of the form:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{node}}(t) = V_{\\mathrm{final}} + (V_{\\mathrm{initial}} - V_{\\mathrm{final}})\\exp(-t/\\tau)$$\nIn this problem, the final voltage is $V_{\\mathrm{final}} = V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$. The worst-case initial condition is that the node is fully discharged, so $V_{\\mathrm{initial}} = V_{\\mathrm{node}}(0) = 0$ V.

To achieve a fast precharge (i.e., small $R_{\\mathrm{on}}$), the pMOS device width $W$ must be sufficiently large, since $R_{\\mathrm{on}} = r_{p}^{\\prime}/W$. Substituting this relationship into the inequality:\n$$\\frac{r_{p}^{\\prime}}{W} \\le \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{pc}}}{C_{\\mathrm{int}}\\ln(V_{\\mathrm{DD}}/\\varepsilon)}$$\nSolving for $W$ gives the condition for the required device width:\n$$W \\ge \\frac{r_{p}^{\\prime} C_{\\mathrm{int}} \\ln(V_{\\mathrm{DD}}/\\varepsilon)}{T_{\\mathrm{pc}}}$$\nThe minimum width $W_{\\min}$ is therefore:\n$$W_{\\min} = \\frac{r_{p}^{\\prime} C_{\\mathrm{int}} \\ln(V_{\\mathrm{DD}}/\\varepsilon)}{T_{\\mathrm{pc}}}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression.

Consider the early regeneration phase immediately after the sampling edge in a single-ended clocking scheme.

            "solution": "The first step is to establish the differential equation governing the differential-mode voltage $v_d(t)$ during the early regeneration phase. This phase is modeled as a linear system. We apply Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) to the differential node, which has an effective capacitance $C$. The total current flowing into this capacitance, $i_C(t)$, is the sum of the input current from the differential pair, $i_{\\text{in}}$, and the regeneration current from the cross-coupled inverters, $i_{\\text{reg}}(t)$.\n\nThe current into the capacitor is defined as:\n$$i_C(t) = C \\frac{d v_d(t)}{dt}$$\nThe input current is provided as a constant value dependent on the input transconductance $g_m$ and the static input differential voltage $V_{\\text{in}}$:\n$$i_{\\text{in}} = g_m V_{\\text{in}}$$\nThe regeneration current is a result of positive feedback from the cross-coupled inverter pair. This current acts to amplify the existing differential voltage $v_d(t)$ and is given by:\n$$i_{\\text{reg}}(t) = g_c v_d(t)$$\nwhere $g_c$ is the effective differential-mode transconductance of the regenerative latch.\n\nAccording to KCL, the sum of currents flowing into the node must equal the current flowing out of the node, which is the current charging the capacitor. Therefore:\n$$i_C(t) = i_{\\text{in}} + i_{\\text{reg}}(t)$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the currents, we get the time-domain differential equation:\n$$C \\frac{d v_d(t)}{dt} = g_m V_{\\text{in}} + g_c v_d(t)$$\nTo solve this equation, we rearrange it into the standard form for a first-order linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$\\frac{d v_d(t)}{dt} - \\frac{g_c}{C} v_d(t) = \\frac{g_m V_{\\text{in}}}{C}$$\nThis equation has a general solution that is the sum of a homogeneous solution, $v_{d,h}(t)$, and a particular solution, $v_{d,p}(t)$.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is $\\frac{d v_{d,h}(t)}{dt} - \\frac{g_c}{C} v_{d,h}(t) = 0$. Its solution describes the natural response of the system and is an exponential function:\n$$v_{d,h}(t) = A \\exp\\left(\\frac{g_c}{C}t\\right)$$\nwhere $A$ is a constant of integration. The positive exponent indicates unstable behavior, which is the desired regeneration.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the forcing term $\\frac{g_m V_{\\text{in}}}{C}$ is a constant, we assume a constant particular solution $v_{d,p}(t) = K$. Substituting this into the differential equation gives:\n$$0 - \\frac{g_c}{C} K = \\frac{g_m V_{\\text{in}}}{C} \\implies K = -\\frac{g_m V_{\\text{in}}}{g_c}$$\nThe full general solution is the sum of the homogeneous and particular solutions:\n$$v_d(t) = v_{d,h}(t) + v_{d,p}(t) = A \\exp\\left(\\frac{g_c}{C}t\\right) - \\frac{g_m V_{\\text{in}}}{g_c}$$\nTo find the constant $A$, we apply the initial condition. The regeneration phase starts at $t=0$, \"immediately after the sampling edge.\" At this instant, the differential voltage across the internal latch nodes is assumed to be zero, as no charge has yet been integrated. Thus, $v_d(0) = 0$.\n$$v_d(0) = A \\exp(0) - \\frac{g_m V_{\\text{in}}}{g_c} = A - \\frac{g_m V_{\\text{in}}}{g_c} = 0$$\nThis implies that $A = \\frac{g_m V_{\\text{in}}}{g_c}$. Substituting this back into the general solution, we obtain the specific solution for $v_d(t)$:\n$$v_d(t) = \\frac{g_m V_{\\text{in}}}{g_c} \\exp\\left(\\frac{g_c}{C}t\\right) - \\frac{g_m V_{\\text{in}}}{g_c} = \\frac{g_m V_{\\text{in}}}{g_c} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{g_c}{C}t\\right) - 1 \\right)$$\nThis equation describes the growth of the differential voltage over time.\n\nAs part of the derivation, we discuss the role of $g_m$. The term $g_c/C$ in the exponent represents the inverse of the regeneration time constant, $\\tau_{\\text{reg}} = C/g_c$. This rate is intrinsic to the latch itself and is not affected by the input stage transconductance $g_m$. The role of $g_m$ is to provide, via the input current $i_{\\text{in}} = g_m V_{\\text{in}}$, the initial \"kick\" that starts the regeneration process. This is evident in the solution, where the pre-exponential factor is directly proportional to $g_m V_{\\text{in}}$. A larger $g_m$ leads to a faster initial rise in $v_d$, allowing the exponential term to take effect sooner and enabling the latch to reach a decision more quickly. Thus, $g_m$ affects the time to resolution but not the fundamental exponential growth rate of the positive feedback loop.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the minimum input-pair transconductance, $g_{m,\\min}$. The condition is that the differential voltage $v_d(t)$ must reach the resolvable level $V_{\\text{res}}$ by the time $T_{\\text{reg}}$. For the minimum $g_m$, this condition is met exactly at $t = T_{\\text{reg}}$:\n$$v_d(T_{\\text{reg}}) = V_{\\text{res}}$$\nSubstituting this into our solution for $v_d(t)$ and using $g_{m,\\min}$:\n$$V_{\\text{res}} = \\frac{g_{m,\\min} V_{\\text{in}}}{g_c} \\left( \\exp\\left(\\frac{g_c T_{\\text{reg}}}{C}\\right) - 1 \\right)$$\nSolving for $g_{m,\\min}$ gives the closed-form expression:\n$$g_{m,\\min} = \\frac{g_c V_{\\text{res}}}{V_{\\text{in}}} \\frac{1}{\\exp\\left(\\frac{g_c T_{\\text{reg}}}{C}\\right) - 1}$$\nFinally, we evaluate this expression numerically using the provided design targets:\n$g_c = 5\\,\\mathrm{mS} = 5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{S}$\n$C = 250\\,\\mathrm{fF} = 250 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{F}$\n$T_{\\text{reg}} = 200\\,\\mathrm{ps} = 200 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n$V_{\\text{in}} = 0.10\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n$V_{\\text{res}} = 0.050\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the dimensionless term in the exponent:\n$$\\frac{g_c T_{\\text{reg}}}{C} = \\frac{(5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{S})(200 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{s})}{250 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{F}} = \\frac{1000 \\times 10^{-15}}{250 \\times 10^{-15}} = 4$$\nNow, substitute this into the expression for $g_{m,\\min}$:\n$$g_{m,\\min} = \\frac{(5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{S}) (0.050\\,\\mathrm{V})}{0.10\\,\\mathrm{V}} \\frac{1}{\\exp(4) - 1}$$\n$$g_{m,\\min} = \\frac{0.25 \\times 10^{-3}}{0.10} \\frac{1}{\\exp(4) - 1} = (2.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{S}) \\frac{1}{\\exp(4) - 1}$$\nUsing the value $\\exp(4) \\approx 54.59815$:\n$$g_{m,\\min} \\approx (2.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{S}) \\frac{1}{54.59815 - 1} = (2.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{S}) \\frac{1}{53.59815}$$\n$$g_{m,\\min} \\approx 0.0466433 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{S} = 0.0466433\\,\\mathrm{mS}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, as requested:\n$$g_{m,\\min} \\approx 0.0466\\,\\mathrm{mS}$$\nThe final answer is requested in $\\mathrm{mS}$.",

We use the standard normal cumulative distribution function (CDF), $\\Phi(z)$, which is the probability that a standard normal random variable takes a value less than or equal to $z$:\n$$\\Phi(z) = P(Z \\le z) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{z} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t^2}{2}\\right) dt$$\nThe error probability $P_{E1}$ can be written as:\n$$P_{E1} = P\\left(\\frac{X - \\mu_X}{\\sigma_X} > \\frac{D - \\mu_X}{\\sigma_X}\\right) = P\\left(Z > \\frac{D - \\mu_X}{\\sigma_X}\\right) = 1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{D - \\mu_X}{\\sigma_X}\\right)$$\nThe error probability $P_{E0}$ can be written as:\n$$P_{E0} = P\\left(\\frac{X - \\mu_X}{\\sigma_X}  \\frac{-D - \\mu_X}{\\sigma_X}\\right) = P\\left(Z  \\frac{-D - \\mu_X}{\\sigma_X}\\right) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{-D - \\mu_X}{\\sigma_X}\\right)$$\n\nNow we apply the constraints $P_{E1} \\le P_t$ and $P_{E0} \\le P_t$.\nFrom the constraint on $P_{E1}$:\n$$1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{D - \\mu_X}{\\sigma_X}\\right) \\le P_t \\implies \\Phi\\left(\\frac{D - \\mu_X}{\\sigma_X}\\right) \\ge 1 - P_t$$\nApplying the inverse CDF, $\\Phi^{-1}(\\cdot)$, which is a monotonically increasing function:\n$$\\frac{D - \\mu_X}{\\sigma_X} \\ge \\Phi^{-1}(1 - P_t)$$\nUsing the identity $\\Phi^{-1}(1-p) = -\\Phi^{-1}(p)$, we have:\n$$\\frac{D - \\mu_X}{\\sigma_X} \\ge -\\Phi^{-1}(P_t) \\implies D \\ge \\mu_X - \\sigma_X \\Phi^{-1}(P_t)$$\n\nFrom the constraint on $P_{E0}$:\n$$\\Phi\\left(\\frac{-D - \\mu_X}{\\sigma_X}\\right) \\le P_t$$\nApplying the inverse CDF:\n$$\\frac{-D - \\mu_X}{\\sigma_X} \\le \\Phi^{-1}(P_t)$$\n$$-D - \\mu_X \\le \\sigma_X \\Phi^{-1}(P_t) \\implies -D \\le \\mu_X + \\sigma_X \\Phi^{-1}(P_t)$$\n$$D \\ge -\\mu_X - \\sigma_X \\Phi^{-1}(P_t)$$\n\nTo satisfy both conditions, $D$ must be greater than or equal to the maximum of the two lower bounds:\n$$D \\ge \\max\\left(\\mu_X - \\sigma_X \\Phi^{-1}(P_t), -\\mu_X - \\sigma_X \\Phi^{-1}(P_t)\\right)$$\nLet $z_t = \\Phi^{-1}(P_t)$. Since $P_t = 1 \\times 10^{-6}  0.5$, $z_t$ is negative, and thus $-z_t$ is positive. The mean $\\mu_X = \\mu_{os} = 0.6~\\text{mV}$ is positive.\nThe two bounds are $\\mu_X - z_t \\sigma_X$ and $-\\mu_X - z_t \\sigma_X$. Since $\\mu_X > 0$, the first term is larger:\n$$\\mu_X - z_t \\sigma_X > -\\mu_X - z_t \\sigma_X$$\nThe more stringent condition is the one that sets the minimum required differential, $D_{\\min}$:\n$$D_{\\min} = \\mu_X - \\sigma_X \\Phi^{-1}(P_t) = \\mu_{os} - (\\sqrt{\\sigma_{os}^2 + \\sigma_{n}^2}) \\Phi^{-1}(P_t)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values provided.\nThe mean of the effective offset is $\\mu_X = \\mu_{os} = 0.6~\\text{mV}$.\nThe standard deviation of the effective offset is:\n$$\\sigma_X = \\sqrt{\\sigma_{os}^2 + \\sigma_{n}^2} = \\sqrt{(2.4~\\text{mV})^2 + (0.8~\\text{mV})^2} = \\sqrt{5.76 + 0.64}~\\text{mV} = \\sqrt{6.4}~\\text{mV}$$\nThe target error probability is $P_t = 1 \\times 10^{-6}$. The corresponding inverse CDF value is:\n$$\\Phi^{-1}(1 \\times 10^{-6}) \\approx -4.75342$$\nNow, we calculate $D_{\\min}$:\n$$D_{\\min} = 0.6~\\text{mV} - (\\sqrt{6.4}~\\text{mV}) \\times (-4.75342)$$\n$$D_{\\min} \\approx 0.6~\\text{mV} + (2.529822~\\text{mV}) \\times (4.75342)$$\n$$D_{\\min} \\approx 0.6~\\text{mV} + 12.0253~\\text{mV}$$\n$$D_{\\min} \\approx 12.6253~\\text{mV}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$D_{\\min} \\approx 12.63~\\text{mV}$$\nThis value represents the minimum input differential required to ensure the error probability for the more vulnerable input case (which is input \"$1$\" due to the positive offset mean) does not exceed the target of $1 \\times 10^{-6}$.",
