            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the minimum precharge time, $t_{pre}$, for a dynamic logic node to reach a voltage strictly greater than $0.95\\,V_{DD}$. We are to start from fundamental principles and then evaluate the derived expression for given component values.\n\nThe system described during the precharge phase can be modeled as a simple series RC circuit. A constant voltage source $V_{DD}$ is connected to a resistor with constant resistance $R_{pre}$, which in turn is connected to a capacitor with capacitance $C_{dyn}$. The other terminal of the capacitor is connected to ground. Let $v(t)$ denote the voltage across the capacitor at time $t$, which is the voltage of the dynamic node.\n\nAccording to Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL), the current flowing out of the voltage source through the resistor must be equal to the current flowing into the capacitor, as the circuit is otherwise open. Let this current be $i(t)$.\n\nUsing Ohm's law, the current through the resistor $R_{pre}$ is the voltage drop across it divided by its resistance:\n$$i(t) = \\frac{V_{DD} - v(t)}{R_{pre}}$$\n\nThe problem requires us to use the capacitor constitutive relation, which defines the current flowing into the capacitor in terms of the rate of change of its voltage:\n$$i(t) = C_{dyn} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}$$\n\nEquating these two expressions for the current $i(t)$ gives the governing first-order linear ordinary differential equation for the circuit:\n$$\\frac{V_{DD} - v(t)}{R_{pre}} = C_{dyn} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}$$\n\nThis equation can be rearranged into the standard form:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}v(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{1}{R_{pre} C_{dyn}} v(t) = \\frac{V_{DD}}{R_{pre} C_{dyn}}$$\n\nLet us define the time constant of the circuit as $\\tau = R_{pre} C_{dyn}$. The differential equation becomes:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}v(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{1}{\\tau} v(t) = \\frac{V_{DD}}{\\tau}$$\n\nThe general solution to this differential equation is the sum of the homogeneous solution and a particular solution. The homogeneous equation is $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_h}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{1}{\\tau} v_h = 0$, which has the solution $v_h(t) = A \\exp(-t/\\tau)$ for some constant $A$. For the particular solution, since the right-hand side is constant, we assume a constant solution $v_p(t) = K$. Substituting this into the full equation gives $\\frac{1}{\\tau} K = \\frac{V_{DD}}{\\tau}$, which implies $K = V_{DD}$.\n\nThus, the general solution for $v(t)$ is:\n$$v(t) = v_h(t) + v_p(t) = A \\exp(-t/\\tau) + V_{DD}$$\n\nTo find the specific solution, we apply the initial condition given in the problem statement: at the start of the precharge phase ($t=0$), the dynamic node voltage is $0$.\n$$v(0) = 0$$\nSubstituting this into the general solution:\n$$v(0) = A \\exp(-0/\\tau) + V_{DD} = A \\cdot 1 + V_{DD} = 0$$\nSolving for $A$, we find $A = -V_{DD}$.\n\nThe specific solution for the voltage on the dynamic node as a function of time is therefore:\n$$v(t) = V_{DD} - V_{DD} \\exp(-t/\\tau) = V_{DD} (1 - \\exp(-t/\\tau))$$\n\nThe problem requires finding the minimum precharge time $t_{pre}$ to ensure the node voltage is strictly greater than $0.95\\,V_{DD}$.

The circuit can be represented as a capacitor $C_{dyn}$ in parallel with a resistor $R_{pd}$, both connected between the dynamic node and ground. The voltage at this node is $v_{dyn}(t)$.\n\nAccording to Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL), the sum of currents leaving the dynamic node must be zero. The current flowing out of the capacitor is $i_C$, and the current flowing through the resistor is $i_R$. Both currents flow from the dynamic node toward ground.\n$$\ni_C(t) + i_R(t) = 0\n$$\nThe problem specifies the constitutive relations to be used. The capacitor current is given by $i_C = C_{dyn} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{dyn}}{\\mathrm{d}t}$. The resistor current is given by Ohm's law, $i_R = \\frac{v_{dyn}(t)}{R_{pd}}$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the KCL equation yields the governing differential equation for the circuit:\n$$\nC_{dyn} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}v_{dyn}(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} + \\frac{v_{dyn}(t)}{R_{pd}} = 0\n$$\nThis is a first-order homogeneous linear ordinary differential equation.

Therefore, the initial condition is $v_{dyn}(0) = V_{DD}$.\n$$\nv_{dyn}(0) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{0}{R_{pd}C_{dyn}}\\right) = A \\exp(0) = A\n$$\nThus, $A = V_{DD}$.

These capacitances are now connected in parallel, forming a single electrical node.\n    - The total capacitance of this combined node is $C_{\\mathrm{total}} = C_{\\mathrm{dyn}} + \\sum C_s$.\n    - After charge redistribution, this entire node settles to a final, common voltage, which we denote as $V_f$.\n    - The total charge stored in the system at this final state is:\n    $$Q_{\\mathrm{total, final}} = C_{\\mathrm{total}} V_f = (C_{\\mathrm{dyn}} + \\sum C_s) V_f$$\n\n3.  **Application of Charge Conservation:**\n    - Since the network is electrically floating (no path to $V_{DD}$ or ground), the total charge must be conserved: $Q_{\\mathrm{total, initial}} = Q_{\\mathrm{total, final}}$.\n    $$C_{\\mathrm{dyn}} V_{DD} = (C_{\\mathrm{dyn}} + \\sum C_s) V_f$$\n    - We can solve for the final voltage $V_f$ as a function of the capacitances and initial voltage:\n    $$V_f = V_{DD} \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{dyn}}}{C_{\\mathrm{dyn}} + \\sum C_s}$$\n\n4.  **Imposing the Design Constraint:**\n    - For the subsequent inverter to correctly interpret the dynamic node's state as a logic 'high', its voltage must remain above the inverter's switching threshold, $V_M$.\n    - Therefore, the constraint is $V_f \\ge V_M$.\n    - To find the minimum required capacitance $C_{\\mathrm{dyn}}$, we consider the boundary condition where the final voltage is exactly at the switching threshold: $V_f = V_M$.
