Model the pass device as a Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) whose conduction during the precharge interval can be approximated by a time-invariant linear on-resistance $R_{on}$. The node has a total capacitance $C_{node}$, and at the beginning of the precharge interval $t = 0$ the node voltage is $V_{i}$. When the clock activates the pass device, the node is connected to an ideal supply at $V_{DD}$ through $R_{on}$ for a duration $T_{chg}$, after which the pass device is turned off and the node is left floating.

A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation\nThe problem requires deriving the node voltage $V_{node}$ at the end of the precharge interval $T_{chg}$. The circuit during this interval consists of a voltage source $V_{DD}$ in series with a resistor $R_{on}$ and a capacitor $C_{node}$. The voltage across the capacitor is $V_{node}(t)$.\n\nPer the principle of charge conservation, the current flowing through the resistor is equal to the current flowing into the capacitor. Let this current be $i(t)$.\n\nAccording to Ohm's law, the current flowing through the resistor $R_{on}$ is given by the voltage drop across it divided by its resistance. The voltage at one end of the resistor is a constant $V_{DD}$, and the voltage at the other end (the capacitor node) is $V_{node}(t)$. Therefore,\n$$i(t) = \\frac{V_{DD} - V_{node}(t)}{R_{on}}$$\n\nThe relationship between charge $Q(t)$ stored on a capacitor and the voltage $V_{node}(t)$ across it is given by the definition of capacitance:\n$$Q(t) = C_{node} V_{node}(t)$$\nThe current into the capacitor is the time rate of change of the stored charge:\n$$i(t) = \\frac{dQ(t)}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}(C_{node} V_{node}(t))$$\nSince $C_{node}$ is a constant, this becomes:\n$$i(t) = C_{node} \\frac{dV_{node}(t)}{dt}$$\n\nEquating the two expressions for the current $i(t)$ yields a first-order linear ordinary differential equation for $V_{node}(t)$:\n$$C_{node} \\frac{d V_{node}(t)}{dt} = \\frac{V_{DD} - V_{node}(t)}{R_{on}}$$\n\nTo solve this differential equation, we can separate the variables. Let $\\tau = R_{on}C_{node}$ be the time constant of the RC circuit.\n$$\\frac{dV_{node}}{V_{DD} - V_{node}} = \\frac{dt}{R_{on}C_{node}}$$\nWe integrate both sides of the equation. The integration for time $t$ is from $0$ to a general time $t$, and the corresponding integration for voltage $V_{node}$ is from the initial voltage $V_{node}(0) = V_i$ to $V_{node}(t)$.\n$$\\int_{V_i}^{V_{node}(t)} \\frac{dV'_{node}}{V_{DD} - V'_{node}} = \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{dt'}{R_{on}C_{node}}$$\nThe left-hand side integral evaluates to:\n$$\\left[ -\\ln(V_{DD} - V'_{node}) \\right]_{V_i}^{V_{node}(t)} = -\\ln(V_{DD} - V_{node}(t)) - (-\\ln(V_{DD} - V_i)) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{DD} - V_i}{V_{DD} - V_{node}(t)}\\right)$$\n(Since the node is charging towards $V_{DD}$ from a lower or equal voltage $V_i$, the term $V_{DD} - V'_{node}$ is non-negative, so absolute values are not required).\n\nThe right-hand side integral evaluates to:\n$$\\frac{1}{R_{on}C_{node}} \\int_{0}^{t} dt' = \\frac{t}{R_{on}C_{node}}$$\n\nEquating the results of the integrations:\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{DD} - V_i}{V_{DD} - V_{node}(t)}\\right) = \\frac{t}{R_{on}C_{node}}$$\n\nTo solve for $V_{node}(t)$, we first exponentiate both sides:\n$$\\frac{V_{DD} - V_i}{V_{DD} - V_{node}(t)} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{t}{R_{on}C_{node}}\\right)$$\nNow, we rearrange the equation to isolate $V_{node}(t)$:\n$$V_{DD} - V_{node}(t) = (V_{DD} - V_i) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{R_{on}C_{node}}\\right)$$\n$$V_{node}(t) = V_{DD} - (V_{DD} - V_i) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{R_{on}C_{node}}\\right)$$\n\nThis expression gives the node voltage at any time $t$ during the precharge phase. The problem specifically asks for the voltage at the end of the precharge interval, i.e., at time $t = T_{chg}$. Substituting $t = T_{chg}$ into the expression gives the final answer:\n$$V_{node}(T_{chg}) = V_{DD} - (V_{DD} - V_i) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T_{chg}}{R_{on}C_{node}}\\right)$$\nThis expression can be rewritten to highlight the contributions of the final steady-state voltage and the decaying initial condition:\n$$V_{node}(T_{chg}) = V_{DD}\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T_{chg}}{R_{on}C_{node}}\\right)\\right) + V_i \\exp\\left(-\\frac{T_{chg}}{R_{on}C_{node}}\\right)$$\nThe first form is more compact and is the standard representation for the transient response.",

It describes a standard scenario in CMOS dynamic logic design and provides plausible physical parameters. The problem is therefore valid, and a solution will be derived.\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum retention time, $T_{\\mathrm{ret}}$, of a dynamic storage node. This time is defined as the duration over which the node voltage $V(t)$ can remain above a specified logic threshold $V_{\\mathrm{th,logic}}$, starting from an initial voltage $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$ at time $t=0$. The node is modeled as a capacitor $C_{\\mathrm{node}}$ discharging through a constant leakage current $I_{\\mathrm{leak}}$.\n\nWe begin by applying the fundamental principles of circuit theory as requested.\n\nFirst, the constitutive relation for a capacitor states that the charge $Q(t)$ stored on the capacitor is proportional to the voltage $V(t)$ across it:\n$$Q(t) = C_{\\mathrm{node}} V(t)$$\nHere, $C_{\\mathrm{node}}$ is the capacitance of the storage node.\n\nSecond, Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) applied to the storage node states that the net current flowing out of the node must be zero. During the evaluate phase, the node is isolated, and the only path for current to flow is to ground through leakage mechanisms. Thus, the current leaving the capacitor, which is the time rate of change of charge, must be equal to the total leakage current $I_{\\mathrm{leak}}$. Since the capacitor is discharging, its stored charge is decreasing. The current is defined as $I(t) = \\frac{dQ(t)}{dt}$. The leakage current $I_{\\mathrm{leak}}$ flows out of the capacitor's positive terminal, so we write:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{leak}} = -\\frac{dQ(t)}{dt}$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the charge stored on the capacitor is decreasing over time.\n\nBy combining these two relations, we can express the leakage current in terms of the node voltage. We differentiate the first equation with respect to time:\n$$\\frac{dQ(t)}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} [C_{\\mathrm{node}} V(t)]$$\nSince $C_{\\mathrm{node}}$ is a constant, we have:\n$$\\frac{dQ(t)}{dt} = C_{\\mathrm{node}} \\frac{dV(t)}{dt}$$\nSubstituting this into the KCL equation yields:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{leak}} = -C_{\\mathrm{node}} \\frac{dV(t)}{dt}$$\n\nThe problem states that $I_{\\mathrm{leak}}$ can be treated as approximately constant. This simplifies the equation into a first-order linear ordinary differential equation for the voltage $V(t)$:\n$$\\frac{dV(t)}{dt} = -\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{leak}}}{C_{\\mathrm{node}}}$$\nTo find the voltage as a function of time, we can integrate this equation. We separate variables, placing voltage terms on one side and time terms on the other:\n$$dV = -\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{leak}}}{C_{\\mathrm{node}}} dt$$\nWe integrate both sides from the initial state at $t=0$ to the final state at $t=T_{\\mathrm{ret}}$. The voltage changes from its initial value $V(0) = V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$ to its final value at the threshold, $V(T_{\\mathrm{ret}}) = V_{\\mathrm{th,logic}}$.\n$$\\int_{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}^{V_{\\mathrm{th,logic}}} dV = \\int_{0}^{T_{\\mathrm{ret}}} -\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{leak}}}{C_{\\mathrm{node}}} dt$$\nSince $I_{\\mathrm{leak}}$ and $C_{\\mathrm{node}}$ are constants, the right-hand side integral is straightforward:\n$$[V]_{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}^{V_{\\mathrm{th,logic}}} = -\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{leak}}}{C_{\\mathrm{node}}} [t]_{0}^{T_{\\mathrm{ret}}}$$\nEvaluating the definite integrals gives:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{th,logic}} - V_{\\mathrm{DD}} = -\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{leak}}}{C_{\\mathrm{node}}} (T_{\\mathrm{ret}} - 0)$$\nThis equation relates the change in voltage to the retention time. We can now solve for $T_{\\mathrm{ret}}$:\n$$-(V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{th,logic}}) = -\\frac{I_{\\mathrm{leak}}}{C_{\\mathrm{node}}} T_{\\mathrm{ret}}$$\n$$T_{\\mathrm{ret}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{node}} (V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{th,logic}})}{I_{\\mathrm{leak}}}$$\nThis is the derived expression for the minimum retention time. It shows that $T_{\\mathrm{ret}}$ is directly proportional to the node capacitance and the allowable voltage drop, and inversely proportional to the leakage current, which is physically consistent.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression using the given numerical parameters:\n-   $C_{\\mathrm{node}} = 3.9 \\times 10^{-15}\\ \\mathrm{F}$\n-   $V_{\\mathrm{DD}} = 0.8\\ \\mathrm{V}$\n-   $V_{\\mathrm{th,logic}} = 0.45\\ \\mathrm{V}$\n-   $I_{\\mathrm{leak}} = 13 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{A}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the allowed voltage drop, $\\Delta V = V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{th,logic}}$:\n$$\\Delta V = 0.8\\ \\mathrm{V} - 0.45\\ \\mathrm{V} = 0.35\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\nNow, we substitute all values into the expression for $T_{\\mathrm{ret}}$:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{ret}} = \\frac{(3.9 \\times 10^{-15}\\ \\mathrm{F}) \\times (0.35\\ \\mathrm{V})}{13 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{A}}$$\nThe units are $(\\mathrm{F} \\cdot \\mathrm{V}) / \\mathrm{A} = (\\mathrm{C}/\\mathrm{V} \\cdot \\mathrm{V}) / (\\mathrm{C}/\\mathrm{s}) = \\mathrm{C} / (\\mathrm{C}/\\mathrm{s}) = \\mathrm{s}$, which is correct for time.\n$$T_{\\mathrm{ret}} = \\frac{1.365 \\times 10^{-15}}{13 \\times 10^{-9}}\\ \\mathrm{s}$$\n$$T_{\\mathrm{ret}} = \\frac{1.365}{13} \\times 10^{-15 - (-9)}\\ \\mathrm{s}$$\n$$T_{\\mathrm{ret}} = 0.105 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{s}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in nanoseconds ($1\\ \\mathrm{ns} = 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{s}$).\n$$T_{\\mathrm{ret}} = 0.105 \\times 10^{3} \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{s} = 105 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{s} = 105\\ \\mathrm{ns}$$\nFinally, we must round the result to four significant figures.\n$$T_{\\mathrm{ret}} = 105.0\\ \\mathrm{ns}$$",
