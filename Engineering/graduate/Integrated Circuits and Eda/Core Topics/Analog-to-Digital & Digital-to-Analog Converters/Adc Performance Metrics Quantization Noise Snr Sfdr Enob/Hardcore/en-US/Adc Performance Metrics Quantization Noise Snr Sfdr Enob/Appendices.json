            "introduction": "Before analyzing the complexities of real-world Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs), it is crucial to first establish a theoretical baseline. This foundational exercise guides you through deriving the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for an ideal ADC from first principles, where performance is limited solely by quantization noise. By working through this problem (), you will solidify your understanding of how an ADC's resolution and full-scale range fundamentally determine its best-case noise performance.",

            "problem": "An ideal mid-tread uniform quantizer within an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) with $N$ bits maps a zero-mean input to one of $2^{N}$ equally spaced codes across its full-scale peak-to-peak range $V_{\\mathrm{pp,FS}}$. The least significant bit (LSB) step size is defined as the code spacing implied by this uniform partition. Consider a single-tone, zero-mean sinusoidal input $x(t) = A \\sin(2 \\pi f_{0} t)$ with peak amplitude $A$ that is strictly within the no-overload region of the quantizer so that clipping never occurs. Assume the quantization error is defined as $e(t) = x(t) - \\hat{x}(t)$, where $\\hat{x}(t)$ is the quantized output, and that $e(t)$ is independent of $x(t)$ and is distributed uniformly over its support determined by the step size of the uniform quantizer.\n\nLet $N = 13$, $V_{\\mathrm{pp,FS}} = 2.56~\\mathrm{V}$, and $A = 0.80~\\mathrm{V}$. Treat all powers as time averages over many periods. Work entirely from first principles, starting from the definitions above, including the definition of power for a sinusoid, the definition of LSB from the full-scale range and bit resolution, and the uniform probability density function for the quantization error induced by the ideal uniform quantizer. Do not invoke any formula without derivation from these bases.\n\nTasks:\n- Derive the input’s peak amplitude represented in LSB units.\n- Derive the expected quantization noise power in $\\mathrm{LSB}^{2}$.\n- Derive the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), defined as the ratio of the sinusoidal signal power to the quantization noise power, expressed in decibels.\n\nReport your final numerical results in the following ordered triple: $\\big[$peak amplitude in LSB, quantization noise power in $\\mathrm{LSB}^{2}$, SNR in $\\mathrm{dB}\\big]$. Express the SNR in decibels and round the SNR to four significant figures. Do not include any units in your final reported triple; units are specified here only for interpretation.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and calculation of three key performance metrics for an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) based on first principles: the peak input amplitude in units of the least significant bit (LSB), the quantization noise power in units of $\\mathrm{LSB}^2$, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in decibels. The problem is well-posed and scientifically sound, providing all necessary parameters for a unique solution.\n\nThe given parameters are:\n- ADC resolution: $N = 13$ bits\n- Full-scale peak-to-peak range: $V_{\\mathrm{pp,FS}} = 2.56~\\mathrm{V}$\n- Input signal: $x(t) = A \\sin(2 \\pi f_{0} t)$ with peak amplitude $A = 0.80~\\mathrm{V}$\n\nWe will address each of the three tasks sequentially.\n\nFirst, we derive the peak amplitude of the input signal in LSB units.\nThe fundamental step size of the quantizer, known as the Least Significant Bit (LSB), is defined by uniformly partitioning the full-scale peak-to-peak range $V_{\\mathrm{pp,FS}}$ into $2^N$ levels. The voltage corresponding to one LSB, denoted by $\\Delta$, is therefore:\n$$ \\Delta = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{pp,FS}}}{2^N} $$\nSubstituting the given values $V_{\\mathrm{pp,FS}} = 2.56~\\mathrm{V}$ and $N = 13$:\n$$ \\Delta = \\frac{2.56}{2^{13}} = \\frac{2.56}{8192}~\\mathrm{V} $$\nThe input signal's peak amplitude is given as $A = 0.80~\\mathrm{V}$. To express this amplitude in LSB units, which we denote as $A_{\\mathrm{LSB}}$, we compute the ratio of $A$ to $\\Delta$:\n$$ A_{\\mathrm{LSB}} = \\frac{A}{\\Delta} = \\frac{0.80~\\mathrm{V}}{\\frac{2.56}{8192}~\\mathrm{V}} = \\frac{0.80 \\times 8192}{2.56} $$\nWe can simplify the ratio $\\frac{0.80}{2.56}$ as $\\frac{80}{256} = \\frac{5 \\times 16}{16 \\times 16} = \\frac{5}{16}$.\n$$ A_{\\mathrm{LSB}} = \\frac{5}{16} \\times 8192 = 5 \\times \\frac{8192}{16} = 5 \\times 512 = 2560 $$\nThus, the peak amplitude of the input sinusoid is $2560$ LSBs. The condition that clipping does not occur is satisfied, as the full-scale peak amplitude is $\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{pp,FS}}}{2} = \\frac{2.56}{2} = 1.28~\\mathrm{V}$, and $A = 0.80~\\mathrm{V} < 1.28~\\mathrm{V}$. Also, in LSB units, the full scale peak amplitude is $\\frac{A_{FS}}{ \\Delta} = \\frac{1.28}{\\Delta} = \\frac{1.28 \\times 8192}{2.56} = \\frac{1}{2}\\times 8192 = 4096$ LSBs. $A_{\\mathrm{LSB}} = 2560 < 4096$.\n\nSecond, we derive the expected quantization noise power in units of $\\mathrm{LSB}^2$.\nThe problem states that the quantization error, $e(t) = x(t) - \\hat{x}(t)$, is uniformly distributed over its support. For an ideal uniform mid-tread quantizer with step size $\\Delta$, the error for any input value is confined to the interval $[-\\frac{\\Delta}{2}, +\\frac{\\Delta}{2}]$. The probability density function (PDF) of the error, $p(e)$, is therefore:\n$$ p(e) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{\\Delta} & \\text{for } -\\frac{\\Delta}{2} \\le e \\le \\frac{\\Delta}{2} \\\\ 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} $$\nThe quantization noise power, $P_n$, is the mean-square value of the error, $E[e^2]$. For a zero-mean process, this is equal to its variance. The mean of the error is indeed zero due to the symmetric distribution around zero: $E[e] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e \\, p(e) \\, de = \\int_{-\\Delta/2}^{\\Delta/2} e \\, \\frac{1}{\\Delta} \\, de = 0$.\nThe noise power is calculated as:\n$$ P_n = E[e^2] = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^2 p(e) \\, de = \\int_{-\\Delta/2}^{\\Delta/2} e^2 \\frac{1}{\\Delta} \\, de $$\n$$ P_n = \\frac{1}{\\Delta} \\left[ \\frac{e^3}{3} \\right]_{-\\Delta/2}^{\\Delta/2} = \\frac{1}{3\\Delta} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{2}\\right)^3 - \\left(-\\frac{\\Delta}{2}\\right)^3 \\right] $$\n$$ P_n = \\frac{1}{3\\Delta} \\left[ \\frac{\\Delta^3}{8} - \\left(-\\frac{\\Delta^3}{8}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{1}{3\\Delta} \\left( \\frac{2\\Delta^3}{8} \\right) = \\frac{\\Delta^2}{12} $$\nThis is the noise power in units of $\\mathrm{V}^2$. The problem asks for the power in units of $\\mathrm{LSB}^2$. Since $1~\\mathrm{LSB}$ corresponds to a voltage of $\\Delta$, $1~\\mathrm{LSB}^2$ corresponds to a power of $\\Delta^2~\\mathrm{V}^2$. To convert $P_n$ to units of $\\mathrm{LSB}^2$, we divide by $\\Delta^2$:\n$$ P_{n, \\mathrm{LSB}^2} = \\frac{P_n}{\\Delta^2} = \\frac{\\Delta^2/12}{\\Delta^2} = \\frac{1}{12} $$\nThe quantization noise power is $\\frac{1}{12}~\\mathrm{LSB}^2$, a result that is independent of the specific ADC parameters, given the model.\n\nThird, we derive the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) in decibels.\nThe power of the sinusoidal input signal $x(t) = A \\sin(2 \\pi f_0 t)$ is its mean-square value, computed by averaging over one period $T = 1/f_0$:\n$$ P_s = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_0^T x(t)^2 \\, dt = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_0^T \\left( A \\sin(2 \\pi f_0 t) \\right)^2 \\, dt = \\frac{A^2}{T} \\int_0^T \\sin^2(2 \\pi f_0 t) \\, dt $$\nUsing the trigonometric identity $\\sin^2(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\cos(2\\theta))$, the integral becomes:\n$$ P_s = \\frac{A^2}{T} \\int_0^T \\frac{1}{2}(1 - \\cos(4 \\pi f_0 t)) \\, dt = \\frac{A^2}{2T} \\left[ t - \\frac{\\sin(4 \\pi f_0 t)}{4 \\pi f_0} \\right]_0^T $$\n$$ P_s = \\frac{A^2}{2T} \\left[ (T - 0) - (0 - 0) \\right] = \\frac{A^2}{2} $$\nThe SNR is the ratio of the signal power $P_s$ to the quantization noise power $P_n$. It is essential to use powers in the same units (e.g., $\\mathrm{V}^2$).\n$$ \\mathrm{SNR} = \\frac{P_s}{P_n} = \\frac{A^2/2}{\\Delta^2/12} = \\frac{6A^2}{\\Delta^2} = 6 \\left(\\frac{A}{\\Delta}\\right)^2 $$\nFrom our first task, we found that $\\frac{A}{\\Delta} = A_{\\mathrm{LSB}} = 2560$. Substituting this value:\n$$ \\mathrm{SNR} = 6 \\times (2560)^2 = 6 \\times 6553600 = 39321600 $$\nThe SNR in decibels ($\\mathrm{dB}$) is defined as $10$ times the base-$10$ logarithm of the power ratio:\n$$ \\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{dB}} = 10 \\log_{10}(\\mathrm{SNR}) = 10 \\log_{10}(39321600) $$\n$$ \\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{dB}} = 10 \\log_{10}(3.93216 \\times 10^7) = 10 \\left( \\log_{10}(3.93216) + \\log_{10}(10^7) \\right) $$\n$$ \\mathrm{SNR}_{\\mathrm{dB}} = 10 \\left( \\log_{10}(3.93216) + 7 \\right) \\approx 10(0.5946268 + 7) = 10(7.5946268) \\approx 75.946268 $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested gives $75.95$.\n\nThe final results for the three tasks are: a peak amplitude of $2560$ LSBs, a quantization noise power of $\\frac{1}{12}~\\mathrm{LSB}^2$, and an SNR of $75.95~\\mathrm{dB}$.",

It describes a standard scenario in the characterization of Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) and provides all necessary data to calculate the requested performance metric. Therefore, a solution can be derived.\n\nThe Spurious-Free Dynamic Range (SFDR) is a crucial metric that quantifies the dynamic range of an ADC before spurious signals interfere with or are mistaken for the desired signal. It is defined as the ratio of the power of the fundamental (or carrier) signal to the power of the largest spurious component in the output spectrum.\n\nLet $P_1$ be the power of the fundamental tone and $P_{spur,max}$ be the power of the largest spurious component. The SFDR, as a power ratio, is:\n$$ \\mathrm{SFDR}_{\\mathrm{ratio}} = \\frac{P_1}{P_{spur,max}} $$\nWhen expressed in decibels, this becomes:\n$$ \\mathrm{SFDR}_{\\mathrm{dB}} = 10\\log_{10}(\\mathrm{SFDR}_{\\mathrm{ratio}}) = 10\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_{spur,max}}\\right) $$\nThis expression can be rewritten using the properties of logarithms as the difference between the power of the fundamental in decibels ($P_{1,\\mathrm{dB}}$) and the power of the largest spur in decibels ($P_{spur,max,\\mathrm{dB}}$):\n$$ \\mathrm{SFDR}_{\\mathrm{dB}} = P_{1,\\mathrm{dB}} - P_{spur,max,\\mathrm{dB}} $$\nThe problem provides power levels in decibels relative to the carrier ($\\mathrm{dBc}$).

Whether the limiting spur is a harmonic generated by the nonlinearity of the ADC or a non-harmonically related tone (e.g., from clock feedthrough or other interference) is irrelevant to the value of SFDR itself, as either type of spur can corrupt the signal.
