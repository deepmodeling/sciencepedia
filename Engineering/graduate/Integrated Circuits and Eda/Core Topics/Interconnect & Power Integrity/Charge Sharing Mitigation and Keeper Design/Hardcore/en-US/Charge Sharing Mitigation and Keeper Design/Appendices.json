            "problem": "Consider a dynamic pass-transistor logic stage used in Electronic Design Automation (EDA) circuits for low-power multiplexing. A dynamic storage node at voltage $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$ and capacitance $C_{X}$ is connected, at time $t=0$, to a victim floating node initially at $0$ and capacitance $C_{Y}$ through a single long-channel $n$-channel metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (NMOS) pass transistor whose gate is held at $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$. Assume the pass device conducts until its source-gate overdrive falls to the threshold and then effectively cuts off, and neglect short-channel effects, body effect, and channel charge sharing. Immediately after the connection is made, the two capacitors share charge subject to the NMOS high-level pass constraint. After this instantaneous charge-sharing event, a weak keeper $p$-channel metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (PMOS) connected as a pull-up from $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$ to the dynamic node is used to restore the dynamic node voltage toward $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$. The keeper’s gate is driven low by an inverter sensing the dynamic node being high, so its source-gate voltage remains approximately constant during the restoration. Model the PMOS as a long-channel device with the standard drift-diffusion current in the linear region, neglecting channel-length modulation and velocity saturation. The PMOS drain is at the dynamic node and the source at $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$.\n\nUse the following physically realistic parameters:\n- Supply voltage $V_{\\mathrm{DD}} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n- NMOS threshold voltage $V_{\\mathrm{th,n}} = 0.30\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n- PMOS magnitude of threshold voltage $|V_{\\mathrm{th,p}}| = 0.30\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n- Dynamic node capacitance $C_{X} = 20\\,\\mathrm{fF}$.\n- Victim node capacitance $C_{Y} = 8\\,\\mathrm{fF}$.\n- PMOS process transconductance parameter $k_{p}' = \\mu_{p} C_{\\mathrm{ox}} = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{V}^{2}$.\n- PMOS channel length $L = 60\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n- Neglect any additional leakage or discharge paths during restoration.\n\nTasks:\n1.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\n#### Task 1: Post-charge-sharing voltage $V_{X,0}$\n\nAt time $t=0$, the dynamic node `X` at voltage $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$ is connected to the victim node `Y` at $0\\,\\mathrm{V}$ through an NMOS pass transistor. The gate of the NMOS is at $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$. Charge flows from node `X` to node `Y`, causing $V_X$ to drop and $V_Y$ to rise. The NMOS device conducts as long as its gate-to-source voltage $V_{GS}$ exceeds its threshold voltage $V_{\\mathrm{th,n}}$.\n\nThe source of the NMOS is the terminal at the lower potential, which is node `Y`. Thus, $V_S = V_Y$. The gate voltage is $V_G = V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$. The condition for the transistor to be on is $V_G - V_S  V_{\\mathrm{th,n}}$. Conduction effectively ceases when $V_Y$ rises to a level where this condition is no longer met, i.e., when $V_Y$ reaches the \"high-level pass limit\". The pass transistor turns off when:\n$$V_{Y,f} = V_G - V_{\\mathrm{th,n}} = V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{th,n}}$$\nwhere $V_{Y,f}$ is the final voltage on node `Y`.\n\nThe process of charge sharing between the two capacitors conserves total charge. The initial charge on the isolated system of two capacitors is:\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{initial}} = C_X V_X(0^{-}) + C_Y V_Y(0^{-}) = C_X V_{\\mathrm{DD}} + C_Y (0) = C_X V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$$\nAfter the charge sharing event, the voltage on node `Y` is $V_{Y,f}$, and the voltage on node `X` has dropped to a new value, which we call $V_{X,0}$. The final charge is:\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{final}} = C_X V_{X,0} + C_Y V_{Y,f} = C_X V_{X,0} + C_Y (V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{th,n}})$$\nBy the principle of charge conservation, $Q_{\\mathrm{initial}} = Q_{\\mathrm{final}}$:\n$$C_X V_{\\mathrm{DD}} = C_X V_{X,0} + C_Y (V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{th,n}})$$\nSolving for $V_{X,0}$:\n$$C_X V_{X,0} = C_X V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - C_Y (V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{th,n}})$$\n$$V_{X,0} = V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - \\frac{C_Y}{C_X} (V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{th,n}})$$\nThis is the expression for the voltage on the dynamic node immediately after the pass transistor turns off.\n\n#### Task 2: Restoration time $t$\n\nAfter the charge sharing, the dynamic node at voltage $V_{X,0}$ is pulled up toward $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$ by a PMOS keeper transistor. The PMOS has its source at $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$, drain at node `X` (voltage $V_X(t)$), and gate at $0\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\nThe PMOS voltages are:\n- Source-gate voltage: $V_{SG} = V_S - V_G = V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - 0 = V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$\n- Source-drain voltage: $V_{SD} = V_S - V_D = V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_X(t)$\n\nThe PMOS is in the linear region if $V_{SD} \\le V_{SG} - |V_{\\mathrm{th,p}}|$. Substituting the expressions for the voltages:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_X(t) \\le V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - |V_{\\mathrm{th,p}}| \\implies V_X(t) \\ge |V_{\\mathrm{th,p}}|$$\nFirst, we calculate the numerical value of $V_{X,0}$:\n$$V_{X,0} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{V} - \\frac{8\\,\\mathrm{fF}}{20\\,\\mathrm{fF}} (1.0\\,\\mathrm{V} - 0.30\\,\\mathrm{V}) = 1.0 - 0.4(0.7) = 1.0 - 0.28 = 0.72\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nSince $|V_{\\mathrm{th,p}}| = 0.30\\,\\mathrm{V}$, and the restoration process starts at $V_X(t=0) = V_{X,0} = 0.72\\,\\mathrm{V}$ and increases from there, the condition $V_X(t) \\ge |V_{\\mathrm{th,p}}|$ is always satisfied. Thus, the PMOS operates entirely in the linear region.\n\nThe current from the PMOS keeper charges the capacitor $C_X$. The current-voltage relationship for a long-channel PMOS in the linear region is:\n$$I_D = k_p' \\frac{W}{L} \\left[ (V_{SG} - |V_{\\mathrm{th,p}}|)V_{SD} - \\frac{1}{2}V_{SD}^2 \\right]$$\nThis current is equal to $I_{C_X} = C_X \\frac{dV_X}{dt}$.\n$$C_X \\frac{dV_X}{dt} = k_p' \\frac{W}{L} \\left[ (V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - |V_{\\mathrm{th,p}}|)(V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_X) - \\frac{1}{2}(V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_X)^2 \\right]$$\nTo solve this differential equation for time $t$, we separate variables:\n$$dt = \\frac{C_X L}{k_p' W} \\frac{dV_X}{(V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - |V_{\\mathrm{th,p}}|)(V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_X) - \\frac{1}{2}(V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_X)^2}$$\nLet $u = V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_X$, so $du = -dV_X$. The voltage $V_X$ goes from $V_{X,0}$ to $V_{\\mathrm{tgt}}$. Correspondingly, $u$ goes from $u_0 = V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{X,0}$ to $u_f = V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{tgt}}$.\n$$t = \\int_0^t dt' = \\frac{C_X L}{k_p' W} \\int_{V_{X,0}}^{V_{\\mathrm{tgt}}} \\frac{dV_X}{\\dots} = \\frac{C_X L}{k_p' W} \\int_{u_0}^{u_f} \\frac{-du}{(V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - |V_{\\mathrm{th,p}}|)u - \\frac{1}{2}u^2}$$\nReversing the limits of integration to remove the minus sign:\n$$t = \\frac{C_X L}{k_p' W} \\int_{u_f}^{u_0} \\frac{du}{u(V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - |V_{\\mathrm{th,p}}| - \\frac{1}{2}u)}$$\nLet $A = V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - |V_{\\mathrm{th,p}}|$. The integrand is $\\frac{1}{u(A - u/2)}$. Using partial fraction expansion $\\frac{1}{u(A - u/2)} = \\frac{1}{A}\\left(\\frac{1}{u} + \\frac{1}{2A-u}\\right)$.\nThe integral becomes:\n$$\\int \\frac{1}{A}\\left(\\frac{1}{u} + \\frac{1}{2A-u}\\right)du = \\frac{1}{A} \\left[ \\ln|u| - \\ln|2A-u| \\right] = \\frac{1}{A} \\ln\\left|\\frac{u}{2A-u}\\right|$$\nEvaluating the definite integral from $u_f$ to $u_0$:\n$$t = \\frac{C_X L}{k_p' W A} \\left[ \\ln\\left|\\frac{u}{2A-u}\\right| \\right]_{u_f}^{u_0} = \\frac{C_X L}{k_p' W A} \\left( \\ln\\left|\\frac{u_0}{2A-u_0}\\right| - \\ln\\left|\\frac{u_f}{2A-u_f}\\right| \\right)$$\n$$t = \\frac{C_X L}{k_p' W A} \\ln\\left| \\frac{u_0(2A-u_f)}{u_f(2A-u_0)} \\right|$$\nSubstituting back $A = V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - |V_{\\mathrm{th,p}}|$, $u_0 = V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{X,0}$, and $u_f = V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{tgt}}$:\n$$t = \\frac{C_X L}{k_p' W (V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - |V_{\\mathrm{th,p}}|)} \\ln\\left( \\frac{(V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{X,0})(2(V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - |V_{\\mathrm{th,p}}|) - (V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{tgt}}))}{(V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{tgt}})(2(V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - |V_{\\mathrm{th,p}}|) - (V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{X,0}))} \\right)$$\nThis is the required expression for the restoration time $t$ as a function of the keeper width $W$.\n\n#### Task 3: Minimum keeper width $W_{\\min}$\n\nWe need to find the minimum width $W_{\\min}$ such that the restoration occurs within $t_{\\max} = 50\\,\\mathrm{ps}$. Since $t$ is inversely proportional to $W$, the minimum width corresponds to the maximum allowed time. We solve the expression from Task 2 for $W$ and set $t = t_{\\max}$:\n$$W_{\\min} = \\frac{C_X L}{k_p' t_{\\max} (V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - |V_{\\mathrm{th,p}}|)} \\ln\\left( \\frac{(V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{X,0})(V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - 2|V_{\\mathrm{th,p}}| + V_{\\mathrm{tgt}})}{(V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{tgt}})(V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - 2|V_{\\mathrm{th,p}}| + V_{X,0})} \\right)$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $C_X = 20\\,\\mathrm{fF} = 20 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{F}$\n- $L = 60\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 60 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $k_p' = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{V}^2 = 100 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{V}^2$\n- $t_{\\max} = 50\\,\\mathrm{ps} = 50 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n- $V_{\\mathrm{DD}} = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n- $|V_{\\mathrm{th,p}}| = 0.30\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n- $V_{X,0} = 0.72\\,\\mathrm{V}$ (calculated in Task 2)\n- $V_{\\mathrm{tgt}} = V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - \\delta = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{V} - 0.010\\,\\mathrm{V} = 0.99\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n\nFirst, calculate the argument of the natural logarithm:\n- $V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{X,0} = 1.0 - 0.72 = 0.28\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n- $V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{tgt}} = 1.0 - 0.99 = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n- $V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - 2|V_{\\mathrm{th,p}}| + V_{\\mathrm{tgt}} = 1.0 - 2(0.30) + 0.99 = 1.0 - 0.6 + 0.99 = 1.39\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n- $V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - 2|V_{\\mathrm{th,p}}| + V_{X,0} = 1.0 - 2(0.30) + 0.72 = 1.0 - 0.6 + 0.72 = 1.12\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n\nLogarithm argument = $\\frac{0.28 \\times 1.39}{0.01 \\times 1.12} = \\frac{0.3892}{0.0112} = 34.75$.\n$\\ln(34.75) \\approx 3.54819$.\n\nNext, calculate the coefficient term:\n- $C_X L = (20 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{F}) \\times (60 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}) = 1.2 \\times 10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{F\\cdot m}$\n- $k_p' t_{\\max} (V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - |V_{\\mathrm{th,p}}|) = (100 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{A/V^2}) \\times (50 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{s}) \\times (1.0 - 0.30\\,\\mathrm{V})$\n$= (5 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{A\\cdot s/V^2}) \\times (0.7\\,\\mathrm{V}) = 3.5 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{C/V}$\n\nNow, calculate $W_{\\min}$:\n$$W_{\\min} = \\frac{1.2 \\times 10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{F\\cdot m}}{3.5 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{C/V}} \\times 3.54819$$\nThe units are $(\\mathrm{F\\cdot m}) / (\\mathrm{C/V}) = ((\\mathrm{C/V})\\cdot \\mathrm{m}) / (\\mathrm{C/V}) = \\mathrm{m}$, which is correct for width.\n$$W_{\\min} = (\\frac{1.2}{3.5} \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}) \\times 3.54819 = (0.342857\\dots \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}) \\times 3.54819$$\n$$W_{\\min} = 1.21664\\dots \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 1.21664\\dots \\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $W_{\\min} = 1.22\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires determining the minimum width $W$ of a PMOS keeper transistor to restore the voltage on a dynamic node after a charge-sharing event within a specified time. The solution is partitioned into two main stages: first, calculating the voltage drop on the dynamic node due to charge sharing, and second, modeling the recovery process driven by the keeper to derive an expression for its width.\n\n**Step 1: Analysis of the Charge-Sharing Event**\n\nInitially, the dynamic node, with capacitance $C_{\\mathrm{D}}$, is charged to the supply voltage $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$. The total charge stored on this node is:\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{initial}} = C_{\\mathrm{D}} V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$$\nThe two internal diffusion nodes, with capacitances $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$, are initially at $0\\ \\mathrm{V}$, so they store no charge. The total initial charge in the isolated system of three capacitors is $Q_{\\mathrm{initial}}$.\n\nDuring the benign glitch, these three nodes are momentarily connected. Charge redistributes among the capacitors until they reach a common voltage, which we will call the post-charge-sharing voltage, $V_{\\mathrm{droop}}$. The total capacitance of the combined network is the sum of the individual capacitances, $C_{\\mathrm{total}} = C_{\\mathrm{D}} + C_{1} + C_{2}$. The total charge after redistribution is:\n$$Q_{\\mathrm{final}} = C_{\\mathrm{total}} V_{\\mathrm{droop}} = (C_{\\mathrm{D}} + C_{1} + C_{2}) V_{\\mathrm{droop}}$$\nBy the principle of charge conservation, the initial charge must equal the final charge, $Q_{\\mathrm{initial}} = Q_{\\mathrm{final}}$.\n$$C_{\\mathrm{D}} V_{\\mathrm{DD}} = (C_{\\mathrm{D}} + C_{1} + C_{2}) V_{\\mathrm{droop}}$$\nSolving for $V_{\\mathrm{droop}}$ gives:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{droop}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{D}}}{C_{\\mathrm{D}} + C_{1} + C_{2}} V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$$\nSubstituting the given values: $V_{\\mathrm{DD}} = 1\\ \\mathrm{V}$, $C_{\\mathrm{D}} = 12\\ \\mathrm{fF}$, $C_{1} = 3\\ \\mathrm{fF}$, and $C_{2} = 5\\ \\mathrm{fF}$:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{droop}} = \\frac{12\\ \\mathrm{fF}}{12\\ \\mathrm{fF} + 3\\ \\mathrm{fF} + 5\\ \\mathrm{fF}} \\times 1\\ \\mathrm{V} = \\frac{12}{20} \\times 1\\ \\mathrm{V} = 0.6\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\nThis is the initial voltage of the dynamic node, $V_{\\mathrm{D}}(t=0)$, at the beginning of the recovery phase.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of the Keeper-Driven Recovery**\n\nAfter the glitch, the keeper transistor turns on to restore the voltage on the dynamic node. The keeper is a PMOS device with its source connected to $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$, gate to ground ($0\\ \\mathrm{V}$), and drain to the dynamic node (at voltage $V_{\\mathrm{D}}(t)$).\nThe gate-source voltage is $V_{\\mathrm{GS}} = V_{\\mathrm{G}} - V_{\\mathrm{S}} = 0 - V_{\\mathrm{DD}} = -V_{\\mathrm{DD}} = -1\\ \\mathrm{V}$.\nThe threshold voltage is $V_{\\mathrm{TP}} = -0.25\\ \\mathrm{V}$. Since $V_{\\mathrm{GS}} (-1\\ \\mathrm{V})  V_{\\mathrm{TP}} (-0.25\\ \\mathrm{V})$, the PMOS is in strong inversion (ON).\n\nTo determine the region of operation (triode vs. saturation), we examine the drain-source voltage, $V_{\\mathrm{DS}} = V_{\\mathrm{D}}(t) - V_{\\mathrm{S}} = V_{\\mathrm{D}}(t) - V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$. The boundary is given by $V_{\\mathrm{DS}} = V_{\\mathrm{GS}} - V_{\\mathrm{TP}}$. In terms of source-referred voltages, saturation occurs for $V_{\\mathrm{SD}} \\ge V_{\\mathrm{SG}} - |V_{\\mathrm{TP}}|$. Triode region occurs for $V_{\\mathrm{SD}}  V_{\\mathrm{SG}} - |V_{\\mathrm{TP}}|$.\nHere, $V_{\\mathrm{SG}} = V_{\\mathrm{S}} - V_{\\mathrm{G}} = V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - 0 = V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$ and $V_{\\mathrm{SD}} = V_{\\mathrm{S}} - V_{\\mathrm{D}} = V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{D}}(t)$.\nThe triode condition is $V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{D}}(t)  V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - |V_{\\mathrm{TP}}|$, which simplifies to $V_{\\mathrm{D}}(t)  |V_{\\mathrm{TP}}|$.\nThe recovery process starts at $V_{\\mathrm{droop}}=0.6\\ \\mathrm{V}$ and aims for $V_{\\mathrm{target}}=0.9\\ \\mathrm{V}$. Since $|V_{\\mathrm{TP}}| = 0.25\\ \\mathrm{V}$, the condition $V_{\\mathrm{D}}(t)  0.25\\ \\mathrm{V}$ is satisfied throughout the entire recovery interval. Thus, the keeper operates in the triode region.\n\nThe problem specifies to linearize the triode current equation for a small source-drain voltage $V_{\\mathrm{SD}}$. The full triode equation for the source-to-drain current $I_{\\mathrm{SD}}$ is:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{SD}} = \\mu_p C_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\frac{W}{L} \\left[ (V_{\\mathrm{SG}} - |V_{\\mathrm{TP}}|)V_{\\mathrm{SD}} - \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{SD}}^2}{2} \\right]$$\nFor small $V_{\\mathrm{SD}}$, the $V_{\\mathrm{SD}}^2$ term is negligible. Substituting $V_{\\mathrm{SG}} = V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$ and $V_{\\mathrm{SD}} = V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{D}}(t)$, the linearized current is:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{SD}} \\approx \\mu_p C_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\frac{W}{L} (V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - |V_{\\mathrm{TP}}|) (V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{D}}(t))$$\nThis shows the keeper acts as a conductor with conductance $G_{\\mathrm{k}}$:\n$$G_{\\mathrm{k}} = \\mu_p C_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\frac{W}{L} (V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - |V_{\\mathrm{TP}}|)$$\nThe current $I_{\\mathrm{SD}}$ from the keeper charges the dynamic node capacitance $C_{\\mathrm{D}}$. The differential equation governing the node voltage $V_{\\mathrm{D}}(t)$ is:\n$$C_{\\mathrm{D}} \\frac{dV_{\\mathrm{D}}}{dt} = I_{\\mathrm{SD}} = G_{\\mathrm{k}} (V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{D}}(t))$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can solve it by letting $v(t) = V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{D}}(t)$, which implies $\\frac{dv}{dt} = -\\frac{dV_{\\mathrm{D}}}{dt}$. The equation becomes:\n$$-C_{\\mathrm{D}} \\frac{dv}{dt} = G_{\\mathrm{k}} v(t) \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{dv}{dt} = -\\frac{G_{\\mathrm{k}}}{C_{\\mathrm{D}}} v(t)$$\nThe solution is $v(t) = v(0) \\exp(-t/\\tau)$, where the time constant is $\\tau = C_{\\mathrm{D}}/G_{\\mathrm{k}}$.\nSubstituting back for $V_{\\mathrm{D}}(t)$:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{D}}(t) = (V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{D}}(0)) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{G_{\\mathrm{k}}}{C_{\\mathrm{D}}} t\\right)$$\nThe initial condition is $V_{\\mathrm{D}}(0) = V_{\\mathrm{droop}}$. The voltage at time $t$ is:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{D}}(t) = V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - (V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{droop}}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{G_{\\mathrm{k}}}{C_{\\mathrm{D}}} t\\right)$$\n\n**Step 3: Derivation of the Keeper Width $W$**\n\nWe require the voltage to recover to $V_{\\mathrm{target}} = 0.9\\,V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$ within time $T = 50\\ \\mathrm{ps}$. Setting $V_{\\mathrm{D}}(T) = V_{\\mathrm{target}}$:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{target}} = V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - (V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{droop}}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{G_{\\mathrm{k}}}{C_{\\mathrm{D}}} T\\right)$$\nRearranging to solve for the exponential term:\n$$\\exp\\left(-\\frac{G_{\\mathrm{k}}}{C_{\\mathrm{D}}} T\\right) = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{target}}}{V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{droop}}}$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$-\\frac{G_{\\mathrm{k}}}{C_{\\mathrm{D}}} T = \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{target}}}{V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{droop}}}\\right)$$\nSolving for $G_{\\mathrm{k}}$:\n$$G_{\\mathrm{k}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{D}}}{T} \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{droop}}}{V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{target}}}\\right)$$\nNow we equate the two expressions for $G_{\\mathrm{k}}$:\n$$\\mu_p C_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\frac{W}{L} (V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - |V_{\\mathrm{TP}}|) = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{D}}}{T} \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{droop}}}{V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{target}}}\\right)$$\nFinally, we solve for the minimum required keeper width $W$:\n$$W = \\frac{L}{\\mu_p C_{\\mathrm{ox}} (V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - |V_{\\mathrm{TP}}|)} \\cdot \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{D}}}{T} \\cdot \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{droop}}}{V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{target}}}\\right)$$\n\n**Step 4: Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe substitute the given numerical values into the expression for $W$:\n- $L = 30\\ \\mathrm{nm} = 30 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- $\\mu_p C_{\\mathrm{ox}} = 100\\ \\mu\\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{V}^{2} = 100 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{V}^{2}$\n- $V_{\\mathrm{DD}} = 1\\ \\mathrm{V}$\n- $|V_{\\mathrm{TP}}| = 0.25\\ \\mathrm{V}$\n- $C_{\\mathrm{D}} = 12\\ \\mathrm{fF} = 12 \\times 10^{-15}\\ \\mathrm{F}$\n- $T = 50\\ \\mathrm{ps} = 50 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{s}$\n- $V_{\\mathrm{droop}} = 0.6\\ \\mathrm{V}$\n- $V_{\\mathrm{target}} = 0.9\\,V_{\\mathrm{DD}} = 0.9\\ \\mathrm{V}$\n\nFirst, calculate the individual terms in the expression for $W$:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - |V_{\\mathrm{TP}}| = 1\\ \\mathrm{V} - 0.25\\ \\mathrm{V} = 0.75\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\n$$\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{D}}}{T} = \\frac{12 \\times 10^{-15}\\ \\mathrm{F}}{50 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{s}} = 0.24 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{V}$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{droop}}}{V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{target}}}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1\\ \\mathrm{V} - 0.6\\ \\mathrm{V}}{1\\ \\mathrm{V} - 0.9\\ \\mathrm{V}}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.4}{0.1}\\right) = \\ln(4)$$\nNow, substitute these into the equation for $W$:\n$$W = \\frac{30 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}}{(100 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{V}^{2}) \\times (0.75\\ \\mathrm{V})} \\times (0.24 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{V}) \\times \\ln(4)$$\n$$W = \\frac{30 \\times 10^{-9}}{75 \\times 10^{-6}} \\times (0.24 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times \\ln(4)\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\n$$W = (0.4 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times (0.24 \\times 10^{-3}) \\times \\ln(4)\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\n$$W = 0.096 \\times 10^{-6} \\times \\ln(4)\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\nUsing $\\ln(4) \\approx 1.38629$:\n$$W \\approx 0.096 \\times 10^{-6} \\times 1.38629\\ \\mathrm{m} \\approx 0.133084 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$$\nThe result is in meters.

This final practice challenges you to derive a purely symbolic, closed-form expression for the minimum required keeper width, $W_{k}^{\\star}$, in a domino logic gate.

            "problem": "Consider a dynamic domino gate in the context of Integrated Circuits and Electronic Design Automation (EDA). The gate uses a precharge-evaluate clocking scheme. During the precharge phase, the dynamic output node is charged to the supply voltage $V_{DD}$ through a precharge transistor. At the beginning of the evaluation phase at time $t=0$, the precharge transistor turns off, and an internal floating diffusion node is connected to the dynamic node through a single $n$-type Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor ($n$-MOSFET) that turns on, enabling charge sharing. The floating internal node has capacitance $C_{X}$ and is initially at $0$ before $t=0$. The dynamic node has capacitance $C_{D}$.\n\nTo mitigate charge sharing and subsequent droop, a keeper is implemented as a weak $p$-type Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor ($p$-MOSFET) whose gate and drain are both connected to the dynamic node and whose source is connected to $V_{DD}$. The keeper has channel length $L_{k}$ and width $W_{k}$. Assume the $p$-MOSFET is always in saturation while it is on, and its drain current for $V_{SG} \\ge |V_{TP}|$ follows the well-tested square-law model $I_{k} = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_{p} C_{ox}\\frac{W_{k}}{L_{k}}(V_{SG}-|V_{TP}|)^{2}$, where $\\mu_{p}$ is the hole mobility, $C_{ox}$ is the oxide capacitance per unit area, and $|V_{TP}|$ is the magnitude of the keeper threshold voltage. Neglect all other leakage currents during evaluation.\n\nAssume the charge sharing between $C_{D}$ and $C_{X}$ is much faster than the keeper response, so the dynamic node voltage experiences an instantaneous drop at $t=0^{+}$ to $V_{0}$ due to charge conservation. For $t0$, the keeper current charges the combined capacitance $C_{D}+C_{X}$, increasing the dynamic node voltage. Let the evaluation time window be $T_{eval}$, and require that by time $T_{eval}$ the dynamic node recovers to at least a minimum voltage $V_{min}$, with the constraint that $V_{DD}-V_{min} \\ge |V_{TP}|$ and $V_{DD}-V_{0} \\ge |V_{TP}|$ so the keeper is active throughout the relevant trajectory.\n\nStarting from first principles (charge conservation and the capacitor current relation $i = C\\, dv/dt$), and using only the square-law saturation model stated above for the keeper, derive a closed-form analytic expression for the minimum keeper width $W_{k}^{\\star}$ that guarantees $V_{D}(T_{eval}) = V_{min}$. Your final expression must be a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of $V_{DD}$, $V_{min}$, $|V_{TP}|$, $C_{D}$, $C_{X}$, $\\mu_{p}$, $C_{ox}$, $L_{k}$, and $T_{eval}$. You do not need to compute a numerical value. No rounding is required. Do not include units in your final answer.",
            "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and internally consistent. It describes a standard scenario in digital integrated circuit design involving charge sharing in dynamic logic and its mitigation using a keeper device. The problem provides all necessary physical models, constraints, and parameters to derive a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution can be derived.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in four principal steps:\n1.  Calculate the initial voltage on the dynamic node immediately after charge sharing.\n2.  Formulate the differential equation governing the voltage recovery of the dynamic node due to the keeper transistor.\n3.  Solve the differential equation for the given boundary conditions.\n4.  Isolate the parameter of interest, the minimum keeper width $W_{k}^{\\star}$.\n\nStep 1: Initial Voltage from Charge Sharing\nAt time $t=0^{-}$, just before the evaluation phase begins, the dynamic node, with capacitance $C_{D}$, is precharged to the supply voltage $V_{DD}$. The internal floating node, with capacitance $C_{X}$, is at a potential of $0$. The total charge stored on these two nodes is given by:\n$$Q_{initial} = C_{D}V_{DD} + C_{X}(0) = C_{D}V_{DD}$$\nAt time $t=0^{+}$, an access transistor turns on, connecting the two nodes. This is modeled as an instantaneous event where charge is conserved. The two capacitances $C_{D}$ and $C_{X}$ are now in parallel, sharing a common voltage which we denote as $V_{0}$. The total charge after sharing is:\n$$Q_{final} = (C_{D} + C_{X})V_{0}$$\nBy the principle of charge conservation, $Q_{initial} = Q_{final}$:\n$$C_{D}V_{DD} = (C_{D} + C_{X})V_{0}$$\nSolving for $V_{0}$, we find the initial condition for the subsequent recovery phase:\n$$V_{0} = V_{DD} \\frac{C_{D}}{C_{D} + C_{X}}$$\nThis represents the voltage on the dynamic node at $t=0^{+}$.\n\nStep 2: Differential Equation for Voltage Recovery\nFor $t  0$, the keeper $p$-MOSFET begins to counteract the voltage droop by sourcing current to the dynamic node. The keeper is a diode-connected $p$-MOSFET with its source at $V_{DD}$ and its gate and drain connected to the dynamic node at voltage $V_{D}(t)$.\nThe source-to-gate voltage is $V_{SG}(t) = V_{S} - V_{G}(t) = V_{DD} - V_{D}(t)$.\nThe problem states that the keeper remains in its saturation region for the entire recovery trajectory, which is ensured by the constraints $V_{DD}-V_{min} \\ge |V_{TP}|$ and $V_{DD}-V_{0} \\ge |V_{TP}|$. The saturation current $I_{k}$ for the $p$-MOSFET is given by the provided square-law model:\n$$I_{k} = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_{p} C_{ox}\\frac{W_{k}}{L_{k}}(V_{SG} - |V_{TP}|)^{2}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $V_{SG}(t)$:\n$$I_{k} = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_{p} C_{ox}\\frac{W_{k}}{L_{k}}(V_{DD} - V_{D}(t) - |V_{TP}|)^{2}$$\nThis current $I_{k}$ charges the total capacitance of the dynamic and internal nodes, $C_{total} = C_{D} + C_{X}$. Using the fundamental capacitor current-voltage relationship, $I = C \\frac{dV}{dt}$:\n$$I_{k} = (C_{D} + C_{X}) \\frac{dV_{D}(t)}{dt}$$\nEquating the two expressions for $I_{k}$ yields the first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation for the dynamic node voltage:\n$$(C_{D} + C_{X}) \\frac{dV_{D}}{dt} = \\frac{1}{2}\\mu_{p} C_{ox}\\frac{W_{k}}{L_{k}}(V_{DD} - V_{D} - |V_{TP}|)^{2}$$\n\nStep 3: Solving the Differential Equation\nThis is a separable differential equation. We can rearrange the terms to separate the variables $V_{D}$ and $t$:\n$$\\frac{dV_{D}}{(V_{DD} - V_{D} - |V_{TP}|)^{2}} = \\frac{\\mu_{p} C_{ox} W_{k}}{2 L_{k} (C_{D} + C_{X})} dt$$\nTo find the relationship between the final voltage and the evaluation time, we integrate both sides over the specified interval. The time $t$ ranges from $0$ to $T_{eval}$, and the dynamic node voltage $V_{D}$ ranges from its initial value $V_{0}$ to the target minimum voltage $V_{min}$. For the minimum width $W_{k}^{\\star}$, the voltage at time $T_{eval}$ will be exactly $V_{min}$.\n$$\\int_{V_{0}}^{V_{min}} \\frac{dV_{D}}{(V_{DD} - V_{D} - |V_{TP}|)^{2}} = \\int_{0}^{T_{eval}} \\frac{\\mu_{p} C_{ox} W_{k}}{2 L_{k} (C_{D} + C_{X})} dt$$\nThe integral of the left side is:\n$$\\int_{V_{0}}^{V_{min}} \\frac{dV_{D}}{(V_{DD} - V_{D} - |V_{TP}|)^{2}} = \\left[ \\frac{1}{V_{DD} - V_{D} - |V_{TP}|} \\right]_{V_{0}}^{V_{min}} = \\frac{1}{V_{DD} - V_{min} - |V_{TP}|} - \\frac{1}{V_{DD} - V_{0} - |V_{TP}|}$$\nThe integral of the right side is:\n$$\\int_{0}^{T_{eval}} \\frac{\\mu_{p} C_{ox} W_{k}}{2 L_{k} (C_{D} + C_{X})} dt = \\frac{\\mu_{p} C_{ox} W_{k} T_{eval}}{2 L_{k} (C_{D} + C_{X})}$$\nEquating the results gives the integrated relationship:\n$$\\frac{1}{V_{DD} - V_{min} - |V_{TP}|} - \\frac{1}{V_{DD} - V_{0} - |V_{TP}|} = \\frac{\\mu_{p} C_{ox} W_{k} T_{eval}}{2 L_{k} (C_{D} + C_{X})}$$\n\nStep 4: Deriving the Expression for Minimum Keeper Width $W_{k}^{\\star}$\nWe now solve for $W_{k}$ to find the minimum width $W_{k}^{\\star}$ required to meet the condition $V_{D}(T_{eval}) = V_{min}$.\n$$W_{k}^{\\star} = \\frac{2 L_{k} (C_{D} + C_{X})}{\\mu_{p} C_{ox} T_{eval}} \\left( \\frac{1}{V_{DD} - V_{min} - |V_{TP}|} - \\frac{1}{V_{DD} - V_{0} - |V_{TP}|} \\right)$$\nTo provide the answer solely in terms of the initial problem parameters, we substitute the expression for $V_{0}$ from Step 1. The denominator of the second term within the parentheses becomes:\n$$V_{DD} - V_{0} - |V_{TP}| = V_{DD} - V_{DD} \\frac{C_{D}}{C_{D} + C_{X}} - |V_{TP}| = V_{DD}\\left(1 - \\frac{C_{D}}{C_{D} + C_{X}}\\right) - |V_{TP}| = V_{DD}\\frac{C_{X}}{C_{D} + C_{X}} - |V_{TP}|$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $W_{k}^{\\star}$ yields the final closed-form analytical expression:\n$$W_{k}^{\\star} = \\frac{2 L_{k} (C_{D} + C_{X})}{\\mu_{p} C_{ox} T_{eval}} \\left( \\frac{1}{V_{DD} - V_{min} - |V_{TP}|} - \\frac{1}{V_{DD}\\frac{C_{X}}{C_{D}+C_{X}} - |V_{TP}|} \\right)$$\nThis expression represents the minimum width of the keeper transistor that ensures the dynamic node voltage recovers to at least $V_{min}$ within the evaluation time $T_{eval}$.",
