            "solution": "**Derivation of the Miller Factor**\n\nThe problem models an aggressor line capacitively coupled to the far-end node of a victim line. The current that flows through the coupling capacitor, $C_c$, from the victim node at voltage $V_v$ to the aggressor node at voltage $V_a$ is given by the fundamental capacitor current-voltage relationship:\n$$i_c = C_c \\frac{d}{dt}(V_v - V_a)$$\nThis current represents an additional load that the victim line's driver must supply. To analyze its effect on the victim's delay, we replace the floating capacitor $C_c$ with an equivalent grounded capacitance, $C_{\\text{eff}}$, at the victim node. This effective capacitance must draw the same amount of current from the victim node as the original coupling capacitor. Therefore, the current $i_c$ must be equal to the current drawn by $C_{\\text{eff}}$:\n$$i_c = C_{\\text{eff}} \\frac{dV_v}{dt}$$\nEquating the two expressions for $i_c$ gives:\n$$C_{\\text{eff}} \\frac{dV_v}{dt} = C_c \\frac{d}{dt}(V_v - V_a) = C_c \\left( \\frac{dV_v}{dt} - \\frac{dV_a}{dt} \\right)$$\nAssuming the victim's voltage is changing, i.e., $\\frac{dV_v}{dt} \\neq 0$, we can divide by $\\frac{dV_v}{dt}$:\n$$C_{\\text{eff}} = C_c \\left( 1 - \\frac{dV_a/dt}{dV_v/dt} \\right)$$\nThe problem defines the slope ratio as $\\alpha = \\frac{dV_a/dt}{dV_v/dt}$. Substituting this definition yields the expression for the effective capacitance:\n$$C_{\\text{eff}} = C_c (1 - \\alpha)$$\nThe Miller factor, $m(\\alpha)$, is the scaling factor that relates $C_c$ to $C_{\\text{eff}}$. From the problem definition, $C_{\\text{eff}} = m(\\alpha) C_c$. By comparison, we find:\n$$m(\\alpha) = 1 - \\alpha$$\nFor the specific case of an aggressor switching opposite to the victim with an equal-magnitude slope, $\\alpha = -1$. The Miller factor becomes:\n$$m(-1) = 1 - (-1) = 2$$\nThis result is consistent with the well-known Miller effect, where a floating impedance is amplified when connected between the input and an inverting output of a gain stage.\n\n**Elmore Delay Formulation**\n\nThe victim interconnect is modeled as a lumped $\\pi$-model RC network. The circuit consists of a source resistance $R_s$ connected to a near-end node (node $1$), which has a capacitance to ground $C_{\\text{near}}$. This node is connected via a wire resistance $R_w$ to a far-end node (node $2$). The far-end node has a capacitance to ground $C_{\\text{far}}$ and the coupling capacitance $C_c$.\n\nUsing the Miller factor derived above, the total effective capacitance to ground at the far-end node, $C_{\\text{total},2}$, is the sum of its intrinsic ground capacitance and the effective capacitance from the coupling effect:\n$$C_{\\text{total},2}(\\alpha) = C_{\\text{far}} + C_{\\text{eff}} = C_{\\text{far}} + m(\\alpha)C_c = C_{\\text{far}} + (1 - \\alpha)C_c$$\nThe Elmore delay at a node $i$ in an RC tree is given by $\\tau_i = \\sum_k R_{ik} C_k$, where $C_k$ is the capacitance at node $k$, and $R_{ik}$ is the resistance of the path from the voltage source to node $i$ that is common with the path from the source to node $k$.\n\nWe are calculating the delay at the far-end node (node $2$), so $\\tau_{\\text{far}} = \\tau_2$. The capacitors in the tree are $C_1 = C_{\\text{near}}$ at node $1$ and $C_2 = C_{\\text{total},2}$ at node $2$.\n- The resistance path from the source to node $2$ is $R_s + R_w$.\n- For the term involving $C_1 = C_{\\text{near}}$ at node $1$: the path from the source to node $1$ has resistance $R_s$. This path is fully contained within the path to node $2$. Thus, the common path resistance is $R_{21} = R_s$.\n- For the term involving $C_2 = C_{\\text{total},2}(\\alpha)$ at node $2$: the path from the source to node $2$ is common with itself. Thus, the common path resistance is $R_{22} = R_s + R_w$.\n\nThe Elmore delay at the far-end node is therefore:\n$$\\tau_{\\text{far}}(\\alpha) = R_{21}C_1 + R_{22}C_2 = R_s C_{\\text{near}} + (R_s + R_w) C_{\\text{total},2}(\\alpha)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C_{\\text{total},2}(\\alpha)$:\n$$\\tau_{\\text{far}}(\\alpha) = R_s C_{\\text{near}} + (R_s + R_w) [C_{\\text{far}} + (1 - \\alpha)C_c]$$\n\n**Calculation of Change in Delay**\n\nWe need to compute the change in the victim's far-end delay, $\\Delta\\tau$, when the aggressor switches opposite with $\\alpha = -1$ relative to the case of a quiet aggressor, for which $\\alpha = 0$.\n$$\\Delta\\tau = \\tau_{\\text{far}}(\\alpha = -1) - \\tau_{\\text{far}}(\\alpha = 0)$$\nFirst, we evaluate the delay for each case.\nFor $\\alpha = -1$:\n$$\\tau_{\\text{far}}(-1) = R_s C_{\\text{near}} + (R_s + R_w) [C_{\\text{far}} + (1 - (-1))C_c] = R_s C_{\\text{near}} + (R_s + R_w) (C_{\\text{far}} + 2C_c)$$\nFor $\\alpha = 0$:\n$$\\tau_{\\text{far}}(0) = R_s C_{\\text{near}} + (R_s + R_w) [C_{\\text{far}} + (1 - 0)C_c] = R_s C_{\\text{near}} + (R_s + R_w) (C_{\\text{far}} + C_c)$$\nNow, we compute the difference:\n$$\\Delta\\tau = [R_s C_{\\text{near}} + (R_s + R_w) (C_{\\text{far}} + 2C_c)] - [R_s C_{\\text{near}} + (R_s + R_w) (C_{\\text{far}} + C_c)]$$\nSimplifying the expression, the terms $R_s C_{\\text{near}}$ and $(R_s + R_w)C_{\\text{far}}$ cancel out:\n$$\\Delta\\tau = (R_s + R_w)(2C_c) - (R_s + R_w)(C_c)$$\n$$\\Delta\\tau = (R_s + R_w)C_c$$\nThis elegant result shows that the change in delay is determined solely by the total upstream resistance to the coupled node and the coupling capacitance itself.\n\nFinally, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$R_s = 600~\\Omega$\n$R_w = 400~\\Omega$\n$C_c = 30~\\mathrm{fF} = 30 \\times 10^{-15}~\\mathrm{F}$\n\n$$\\Delta\\tau = (600~\\Omega + 400~\\Omega) \\times (30 \\times 10^{-15}~\\mathrm{F})$$\n$$\\Delta\\tau = (1000~\\Omega) \\times (30 \\times 10^{-15}~\\mathrm{F})$$\n$$\\Delta\\tau = 10^3 \\times 30 \\times 10^{-15}~\\mathrm{s}$$\n$$\\Delta\\tau = 30 \\times 10^{-12}~\\mathrm{s}$$\n$$\\Delta\\tau = 30~\\mathrm{ps}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

The limits of integration become $u=t$ for $z'=0$ and $u=t-2\\ell/v = t-2\\tau$ for $z'=\\ell$.\n$$ V_{NE}(t) = \\frac{Z_0 C_m'}{2} \\int_{t}^{t-2\\tau} v_f'(u) \\left(-\\frac{v}{2} du\\right) = \\frac{Z_0 C_m' v}{4} \\int_{t-2\\tau}^{t} v_f'(u) du $$\n$$ V_{NE}(t) = \\frac{Z_0 C_m' v}{4} [v_f(t) - v_f(t - 2\\tau)] $$\n\n**Far-End Crosstalk (FECT) Voltage, $V_{FE}(t)$:**\nThe FECT voltage at $z=\\ell$ is the superposition of all forward-traveling waves. A wave generated at $z'$ at time $t'$ arrives at $z=\\ell$ at time $t = t' + (\\ell-z')/v$. Thus, we evaluate the source at $t' = t - (\\ell-z')/v$.\n$$ V_{FE}(t) = \\int_0^{\\ell} \\frac{1}{2} Z_0 i_s(z', t - (\\ell-z')/v) dz' $$\nThe argument of the derivative becomes:\n$$ (t - (\\ell-z')/v) - z'/v = t - \\ell/v + z'/v - z'/v = t - \\ell/v = t - \\tau $$\nThe argument is independent of $z'$, so the integrand is constant over the length of the line.\n$$ V_{FE}(t) = \\int_0^{\\ell} \\frac{1}{2} Z_0 C_m' v_f'(t - \\tau) dz' = \\frac{Z_0 C_m' \\ell}{2} v_f'(t - \\tau) $$\n\n**Peak NECT Amplitudes (TL and RC models)**\n\nFirst, we calculate the relevant propagation characteristics:\n- $Z_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{L'}{C'}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{250 \\times 10^{-9}}{100 \\times 10^{-12}}} = \\sqrt{2500} = 50 \\ \\Omega$\n- $v = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{L'C'}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{(250 \\times 10^{-9})(100 \\times 10^{-12})}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{25 \\times 10^{-18}}} = 2.0 \\times 10^8 \\ \\text{m/s}$\n- $\\tau = \\frac{\\ell}{v} = \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{-2}}{2.0 \\times 10^8} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\text{s}$\n\nThe aggressor forward wave $v_f(t) = v_s(t)/2$ is:\n- $v_f(t) = \\frac{V_0}{2t_r} t$ for $0 \\leq t \\leq t_r$\n- $v_f(t) = \\frac{V_0}{2}$ for $t > t_r$\n\nThe given rise time is $t_r = 5.0 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\text{s}$. We note that $t_r = 2\\tau$. This is a critical condition for determining the pulse shape.\n\n**Peak NECT from Transmission Line (TL) Model:**\nThe NECT waveform is $V_{NE}(t) = K_{NE} [v_f(t) - v_f(t - 2\\tau)]$, where $K_{NE} = \\frac{Z_0 C_m' v}{4}$.\nSince $t_r = 2\\tau$, we analyze the waveform in intervals:\n- For $0 \\leq t < 2\\tau$: $v_f(t-2\\tau) = 0$. Thus, $V_{NE}(t) = K_{NE} v_f(t) = K_{NE} \\frac{V_0}{2t_r} t$. The voltage ramps up.\n- At $t=2\\tau=t_r$, the ramp reaches its peak: $V_{NE}(2\\tau) = K_{NE} v_f(2\\tau) = K_{NE} v_f(t_r) = K_{NE} \\frac{V_0}{2}$.\n- For $t > 2\\tau=t_r$, $v_f(t)$ has saturated to $V_0/2$, while $v_f(t-2\\tau)$ is ramping up. The difference, and thus $V_{NE}(t)$, decreases.\n\nThe peak amplitude is reached at $t = 2\\tau = t_r$:\n$$ V_{\\text{NE,TL,peak}} = K_{NE} \\frac{V_0}{2} = \\left(\\frac{Z_0 C_m' v}{4}\\right) \\frac{V_0}{2} = \\frac{Z_0 C_m' v V_0}{8} $$\nThis expression is valid for $t_r \\ge 2\\tau$. Since $t_r = 2\\tau$, it applies here.\nNumerically:\n$$ V_{\\text{NE,TL,peak}} = \\frac{(50) \\cdot (5 \\times 10^{-12}) \\cdot (2 \\times 10^8) \\cdot (1.0)}{8} = \\frac{50 \\times 10^{-4}}{8} = 6.25 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\text{V} $$\n\n**Peak NECT from Lumped Resistive-Capacitive (RC) Model:**\nThe problem specifies modeling the coupling as a single capacitor $C_m = C_m' \\ell$ injecting a current into the near-end termination $Z_0$. The current is driven by the change in the aggressor's near-end voltage, $v_1(0,t) = v_f(t)$.\nThe injected current is $i_{RC}(t) = C_m \\frac{d v_f(t)}{dt}$.\nThe resulting voltage is $V_{\\text{NE,RC}}(t) = i_{RC}(t) \\cdot Z_0 = (C_m' \\ell) Z_0 \\frac{d v_f(t)}{dt}$.\n\nDuring the ramp, for $0 < t < t_r$, the derivative is constant:\n$$ \\frac{d v_f(t)}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left(\\frac{V_0}{2t_r}t\\right) = \\frac{V_0}{2t_r} $$\nThe RC model predicts a rectangular voltage pulse of duration $t_r$ and amplitude:\n$$ V_{\\text{NE,RC,peak}} = \\frac{C_m' \\ell Z_0 V_0}{2t_r} $$\nNumerically:\n$$ V_{\\text{NE,RC,peak}} = \\frac{(5 \\times 10^{-12}) \\cdot (5.0 \\times 10^{-2}) \\cdot (50) \\cdot (1.0)}{2 \\cdot (5.0 \\times 10^{-10})} = \\frac{1.25 \\times 10^{-11}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-9}} = 1.25 \\times 10^{-2} \\ \\text{V} $$\n\n**Ratio of Peak Amplitudes**\n\nWe compute the ratio $R = \\frac{V_{\\text{NE,TL,peak}}}{V_{\\text{NE,RC,peak}}}$.\nAnalytically:\n$$ R = \\frac{\\frac{Z_0 C_m' v V_0}{8}}{\\frac{C_m' \\ell Z_0 V_0}{2t_r}} = \\frac{Z_0 C_m' v V_0}{8} \\cdot \\frac{2t_r}{C_m' \\ell Z_0 V_0} = \\frac{2vt_r}{8\\ell} = \\frac{vt_r}{4\\ell} $$\nUsing the relation $\\ell = v\\tau$, this simplifies to:\n$$ R = \\frac{vt_r}{4v\\tau} = \\frac{t_r}{4\\tau} $$\nFor the specific case given, $t_r = 2\\tau$:\n$$ R = \\frac{2\\tau}{4\\tau} = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5 $$\nUsing the calculated numerical peak values:\n$$ R = \\frac{6.25 \\times 10^{-3}}{1.25 \\times 10^{-2}} = \\frac{0.00625}{0.0125} = 0.5 $$\nThe problem asks for the ratio to be expressed as a decimal number rounded to four significant figures.\n\n$$ R = 0.5000 $$",
