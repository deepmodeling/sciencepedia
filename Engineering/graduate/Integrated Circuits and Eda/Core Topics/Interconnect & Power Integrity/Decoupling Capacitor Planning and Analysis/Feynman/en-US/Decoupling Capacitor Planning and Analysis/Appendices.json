Let this maximum value be $|Z_{1, \\text{max}}|$. The condition on $N$ becomes:\n$$N \\ge \\frac{|Z_{1, \\text{max}}|}{Z_{\\text{target}}}$$\nwhere $|Z_{1, \\text{max}}| = \\max_{\\omega \\in [\\omega_{\\text{min}}, \\omega_{\\text{max}}]} |Z_1(\\omega)|$.\n\nThe magnitude of the impedance of a single capacitor is:\n$$|Z_1(\\omega)| = \\sqrt{R^2 + \\left(\\omega L - \\frac{1}{\\omega C}\\right)^2}$$\nTo find the maximum of $|Z_1(\\omega)|$, we analyze its behavior as a function of $\\omega$.

At $\\omega_{\\mathrm{ar}}$, the reactance is $X_{C_d} = -1/(\\omega_{\\mathrm{ar}} C_d) \\approx -0.047\\,\\Omega$. This is close to $R_d$, providing effective damping. The added conductance is $G_d = R_d/(R_d^2 + X_{C_d}^2) \\approx 10.6\\,\\mathrm{S}$. The new total conductance is $G'_{\\mathrm{total}} \\approx 1.009\\,\\mathrm{S} + 10.6\\,\\mathrm{S} = 11.61\\,\\mathrm{S}$. The new peak impedance is $Z'_{\\mathrm{peak}} \\approx 1/11.61 \\approx 0.086\\,\\Omega$. This is below the target $Z_t = 0.1\\,\\Omega$. This is an effective and standard solution.\n\n**B. Increase ESR of capacitor 1.**\nIf $R_1$ is increased to $0.17\\,\\Omega$, the new peak impedance is calculated to be approximately $0.308\\,\\Omega$. This is still well above the $0.1\\,\\Omega$ target.\n\n**C. Add an additional identical capacitor.**\nAdding another identical low-ESR capacitor in parallel does not add significant damping (resistance). It will shift the anti-resonance frequency but will not suppress the high-Q peak sufficiently.\n\n**D. Insert a ferrite bead in series.**\nA ferrite bead is a series impedance element. Adding it in series with the parallel capacitor network would increase the total impedance at the anti-resonance peak ($Z'_{\\mathrm{total}} = Z_{\\mathrm{bead}} + Z_{\\mathrm{PDN}}$), making the problem worse.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\nThe analysis shows that only option A provides sufficient damping to reduce the anti-resonance peak impedance below the target value. It is a physically sound and quantitatively correct strategy.",
