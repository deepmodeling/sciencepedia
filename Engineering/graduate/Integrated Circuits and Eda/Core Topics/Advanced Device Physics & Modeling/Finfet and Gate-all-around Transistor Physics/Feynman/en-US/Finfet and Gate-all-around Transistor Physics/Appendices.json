            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and comparison of the input gate capacitance for a planar MOSFET and a tri-gate FinFET under a set of idealizing assumptions. The core of the analysis rests on modeling the gate capacitance using the parallel-plate capacitor formula, derived from Gauss's law, and applying it to the specific geometries of the two devices.\n\nFirst, we establish the fundamental formula for the capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor, which is applicable here due to the assumption of a perfect conductor gate, localized inversion charge, and the neglect of fringing fields. The capacitance $C$ is given by:\n$$\nC = \\frac{\\epsilon A}{d}\n$$\nwhere $\\epsilon$ is the permittivity of the dielectric material, $A$ is the area of the plates, and $d$ is the separation between them. In this problem, the dielectric is specified by its relative permittivity $\\kappa_{\\text{ox}}$, so $\\epsilon = \\kappa_{\\text{ox}} \\epsilon_0$, where $\\epsilon_0$ is the vacuum permittivity. The separation is the gate dielectric thickness, $t_{\\text{ox}}$.\n\nLet us derive the \"input capacitance per unit width\" for the planar MOSFET, which we denote as $C''_{\\text{p}}$.\nThe planar MOSFET has a gate of length $L$ and width $W_{\\text{p}}$. The gate area is $A_{\\text{p}} = L W_{\\text{p}}$. The total gate capacitance is therefore:\n$$\nC_{\\text{p}} = \\frac{\\kappa_{\\text{ox}} \\epsilon_0 A_{\\text{p}}}{t_{\\text{ox}}} = \\frac{\\kappa_{\\text{ox}} \\epsilon_0 L W_{\\text{p}}}{t_{\\text{ox}}}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the input capacitance per unit gate length, $C'_{\\text{p}}$, which is obtained by dividing $C_{\\text{p}}$ by the channel length $L$:\n$$\nC'_{\\text{p}} = \\frac{C_{\\text{p}}}{L} = \\frac{\\kappa_{\\text{ox}} \\epsilon_0 W_{\\text{p}}}{t_{\\text{ox}}}\n$$\nNext, we find the input capacitance per unit width, $C''_{\\text{p}}$, by normalizing $C'_{\\text{p}}$ to the planar device width $W_{\\text{p}}$:\n$$\nC''_{\\text{p}} = \\frac{C'_{\\text{p}}}{W_{\\text{p}}} = \\frac{1}{W_{\\text{p}}} \\left( \\frac{\\kappa_{\\text{ox}} \\epsilon_0 W_{\\text{p}}}{t_{\\text{ox}}} \\right) = \\frac{\\kappa_{\\text{ox}} \\epsilon_0}{t_{\\text{ox}}}\n$$\nThis quantity is the well-known oxide capacitance per unit area, often denoted $C_{\\text{ox}}$.\n\nNow, we perform the same derivation for the tri-gate FinFET. The gate wraps around the top and two sidewalls of a rectangular fin of height $H_{\\text{f}}$ and thickness $W_{\\text{f}}$. The total gate capacitance is the sum of the capacitances from these three surfaces, as they are in parallel.\n1.  The top gate capacitance, $C_{\\text{top}}$, corresponds to an area $A_{\\text{top}} = L W_{\\text{f}}$.\n    $$\n    C_{\\text{top}} = \\frac{\\kappa_{\\text{ox}} \\epsilon_0 L W_{\\text{f}}}{t_{\\text{ox}}}\n    $$\n2.

Substituting the derived expressions:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\frac{\\kappa_{\\text{ox}} \\epsilon_0}{t_{\\text{ox}}} \\left( 1 + \\frac{2H_{\\text{f}}}{W_{\\text{f}}} \\right)}{\\frac{\\kappa_{\\text{ox}} \\epsilon_0}{t_{\\text{ox}}}}\n$$\nThe term $\\frac{\\kappa_{\\text{ox}} \\epsilon_0}{t_{\\text{ox}}}$ cancels, yielding a simple geometric ratio:\n$$\nR = 1 + \\frac{2H_{\\text{f}}}{W_{\\text{f}}}\n$$\nUsing the provided numerical values: $H_{\\text{f}} = 27\\ \\text{nm}$ and $W_{\\text{f}} = 7.5\\ \\text{nm}$.\n$$\nR = 1 + \\frac{2 \\times 27}{7.5} = 1 + \\frac{54}{7.5} = 1 + 7.2 = 8.2\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nR = 8.200\n$$\n\nFinally, the problem asks what happens to this ratio if the FinFET input capacitance is normalized to the electrically active perimeter rather than the drawn fin width $W_{\\text{f}}$. The electrically active perimeter is the total width of the channel controlled by the gate, which is $W_{\\text{eff}} = W_{\\text{f}} + 2H_{\\text{f}}$.\nLet's define a new normalized capacitance for the FinFET, $C'''_{\\text{f}}$, using this perimeter:\n$$\nC'''_{\\text{f}} = \\frac{C'_{\\text{f}}}{W_{\\text{eff}}} = \\frac{1}{W_{\\text{f}} + 2H_{\\text{f}}} \\left( \\frac{\\kappa_{\\text{ox}} \\epsilon_0 (W_{\\text{f}} + 2H_{\\text{f}})}{t_{\\text{ox}}} \\right) = \\frac{\\kappa_{\\text{ox}} \\epsilon_0}{t_{\\text{ox}}}\n$$\nThis new FinFET capacitance per unit of active width, $C'''_{\\text{f}}$, is identical to the planar MOSFET capacitance per unit width, $C''_{\\text{p}}$.\nTherefore, the new ratio $R' = \\frac{C'''_{\\text{f}}}{C''_{\\text{p}}}$ would be:\n$$\nR' = \\frac{\\frac{\\kappa_{\\text{ox}} \\epsilon_0}{t_{\\text{ox}}}}{\\frac{\\kappa_{\\text{ox}} \\epsilon_0}{t_{\\text{ox}}}} = 1\n$$\nThus, if the FinFET input capacitance is normalized to its full electrically active perimeter, the resulting capacitance per unit width becomes identical to that of the planar device, and the ratio becomes exactly $1$. This is because this normalization effectively compares the fundamental gate oxide capacitance per unit area, which is the same for both devices by problem definition.",

            "problem": "Consider a Fin Field-Effect Transistor (FinFET) or a Gate-All-Around (GAA) transistor fabricated on Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI), modeled electrostatically by a single effective channel potential node with capacitive couplings. Let the gate node be driven at voltage $V_{G}$, the back-gate (handle wafer) node at voltage $V_{B}$, and the intermediate silicon body node be denoted by $V_{\\text{body}}$. Assume the channel potential is $ \\varphi_{c} $, and the threshold voltage $V_{T}$ is defined by the gate voltage $V_{G}$ required to establish a fixed target channel potential $ \\varphi_{c} = \\varphi_{\\text{th}} $, where $ \\varphi_{\\text{th}} $ is a constant band-bending criterion (for example, twice the Fermi potential), independent of $V_{G}$ and $V_{B}$. \n\nUse the following quasi-electrostatic, small-signal, low-frequency capacitive model based on Gauss’s law and the definition of capacitance $Q = C \\Delta V$:\n- A gate-to-channel effective oxide capacitance $C_{g}$.\n- A channel-to-body capacitance $C_{cb}$ that captures electric field coupling from the channel into the silicon body through isolation dielectrics.\n- A body-to-back-gate (through buried oxide) capacitance $C_{box}$.\n\nAll other nodes (source and drain) are held at fixed potentials and may be neglected for the purpose of the ratio you will derive. You may assume that inversion charge is negligible at threshold so that quantum capacitance does not alter the coupling ratio. Work within the quasi-static approximation where displacement currents through these capacitors enforce charge neutrality on the channel node.\n\nStarting from the fundamental statements of Gauss’s law and the capacitance definition, derive closed-form analytical expressions for the sensitivity of threshold voltage to back-gate voltage, $ \\partial V_{T} / \\partial V_{B} $, under the condition $ d\\varphi_{c} = 0 $.

            "solution": "The problem is well-posed and grounded in the fundamental principles of electrostatics as applied to Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) device physics. We can proceed with a formal derivation.\n\nThe analysis begins from the principle of charge conservation for any electrically floating node within the transistor structure under the quasi-static approximation. The channel and, in one case, the silicon body are treated as such floating nodes. The net charge on a floating node is determined by the potentials of the surrounding electrodes through capacitive coupling. For a small perturbation in these external potentials, the floating node potentials adjust to maintain charge neutrality.\n\nLet the total charge on the channel node be $Q_{\\text{channel}}$. This charge is the sum of charges induced through the gate capacitor $C_{g}$ and the channel-to-body capacitor $C_{cb}$. Using the definition of capacitance $Q=C\\Delta V$, we can write the charge on the capacitor plates connected to the channel as $C_{g}(V_{G} - \\varphi_{c})$ and $C_{cb}(V_{\\text{body}} - \\varphi_{c})$. The charge neutrality condition for the channel node, which is at potential $\\varphi_c$, dictates that the sum of displacement currents into the node is zero. In the quasi-static limit, this implies that the total differential of the net charge on the node is zero.\n\nThe total charge on the channel node can be expressed as:\n$$Q_{\\text{channel}} = C_g(\\varphi_c - V_G) + C_{cb}(\\varphi_c - V_{\\text{body}}) + Q_{\\text{offset}}$$\nwhere $Q_{\\text{offset}}$ represents fixed charges and an assumed constant depletion charge at the threshold condition. Taking the total differential and setting it to zero ($dQ_{\\text{channel}} = 0$) gives:\n$$C_g(d\\varphi_c - dV_G) + C_{cb}(d\\varphi_c - dV_{\\text{body}}) = 0$$\nThis can be rearranged as:\n$$(C_g + C_{cb})d\\varphi_c = C_g dV_G + C_{cb} dV_{\\text{body}}$$\n\nThe problem defines the threshold voltage $V_T$ as the gate voltage $V_G$ that results in a fixed channel potential $\\varphi_c = \\varphi_{\\text{th}}$. To find the sensitivity of $V_T$ to the back-gate voltage $V_B$, we evaluate the relationship between their differentials, $dV_G$ and $dV_B$, under the specific condition that the channel potential is held constant at the threshold value. This means we impose the constraint $d\\varphi_c = 0$. In this context, any change in the required gate voltage is a change in the threshold voltage, so we can set $dV_G = dV_T$.\n\nSubstituting $d\\varphi_c = 0$ and $dV_G = dV_T$ into our general equation yields:\n$$0 = C_g dV_T + C_{cb} dV_{\\text{body}}$$\n$$-C_g dV_T = C_{cb} dV_{\\text{body}}$$\nThis equation forms the basis for both required derivations. We now analyze the two specified configurations.\n\n**1. Tied Substrate Configuration**\n\nIn this configuration, the silicon body node is ohmically connected to the back-gate, such that their potentials are identical: $V_{\\text{body}} = V_B$. Consequently, any small-signal variation in the back-gate voltage results in an identical variation in the body voltage:\n$$dV_{\\text{body}} = dV_B$$\nSubstituting this into our derived relationship:\n$$-C_g dV_T = C_{cb} dV_B$$\nSolving for the sensitivity of threshold voltage to back-gate voltage, $\\frac{\\partial V_T}{\\partial V_B}$, we get:\n$$\\frac{\\partial V_T}{\\partial V_B} = -\\frac{C_{cb}}{C_g}$$\n\n**2. Floating Substrate Configuration**\n\nIn this case, the silicon body is electrically floating. It is capacitively coupled to the channel via $C_{cb}$ and to the back-gate via $C_{box}$. As a floating node, the body must also satisfy the charge neutrality condition. The total charge on the body node, $Q_{\\text{body}}$, is:\n$$Q_{\\text{body}} = C_{cb}(V_{\\text{body}} - \\varphi_c) + C_{box}(V_{\\text{body}} - V_B) + Q'_{\\text{offset}}$$\nSetting the total differential $dQ_{\\text{body}}$ to zero gives:\n$$C_{cb}(dV_{\\text{body}} - d\\varphi_c) + C_{box}(dV_{\\text{body}} - dV_B) = 0$$\nWe now have a system of two linear differential equations:\n(i) For the channel node: $-C_g dV_T = C_{cb} dV_{\\text{body}}$ (since $d\\varphi_c=0$)\n(ii) For the body node: $C_{cb}(dV_{\\text{body}} - d\\varphi_c) + C_{box}(dV_{\\text{body}} - dV_B) = 0$\n\nAgain, we apply the condition $d\\varphi_c = 0$ to the second equation:\n$$C_{cb}dV_{\\text{body}} + C_{box}(dV_{\\text{body}} - dV_B) = 0$$\n$$(C_{cb} + C_{box})dV_{\\text{body}} = C_{box} dV_B$$\nFrom this, we can express the change in body voltage as a function of the change in back-gate voltage. This is a capacitive voltage divider:\n$$dV_{\\text{body}} = \\frac{C_{box}}{C_{cb} + C_{box}} dV_B$$\nNow, substitute this expression for $dV_{\\text{body}}$ into equation (i):\n$$-C_g dV_T = C_{cb} \\left( \\frac{C_{box}}{C_{cb} + C_{box}} \\right) dV_B$$\nFinally, we solve for the sensitivity $\\frac{\\partial V_T}{\\partial V_B}$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial V_T}{\\partial V_B} = - \\frac{C_{cb} C_{box}}{C_g (C_{cb} + C_{box})}$$\n\n**Electrostatic Explanation for Reduced Body Coupling in FinFETs and GAAFETs**\n\nThe sensitivity $\\frac{\\partial V_T}{\\partial V_B}$ is a direct measure of the \"body effect,\" which quantifies how much the threshold voltage is modulated by the substrate potential. A smaller magnitude of this sensitivity indicates better immunity to substrate voltage variations and improved device performance, particularly in terms of short-channel effects.\n\nThe derived sensitivities for both tied and floating substrates are proportional to the ratio $\\frac{C_{cb}}{C_g}$ or a related effective capacitance ratio. The reduction in body coupling in FinFETs and Gate-All-Around (GAA) FETs compared to traditional planar MOSFETs can be explained by examining how their geometry affects this capacitance ratio, as interpreted through electrostatic field lines and Gauss's law.\n\nIn a planar MOSFET, the gate electrode is situated on top of the channel, covering a solid angle of approximately $2\\pi$ steradians as seen from the channel. The substrate (body) occupies the other half-space below the channel. Consequently, there is a significant area for electric field lines to extend from the substrate to the channel, resulting in a non-negligible channel-to-body capacitance, $C_{cb}$.\n\nIn a FinFET, the gate is wrapped around the channel on three sides. In a GAA FET, the gate completely surrounds the channel (a solid angle of $4\\pi$ steradians). This multi-gate geometry drastically enhances the electrostatic control of the gate over the channel. According to Gauss's law, the electric field lines originating from the charge in the channel must terminate on surrounding conductors. Because the gate electrode in a FinFET/GAA is much closer and covers a far greater portion of the surface surrounding the channel, it terminates the vast majority of these field lines. This leads to a very large gate-to-channel capacitance, $C_g$.\n\nConversely, the substrate/back-gate is electrostatically \"screened\" from the channel by this enveloping gate. Field lines originating from the back-gate have very few paths to reach the channel directly; most will terminate on the gate electrode itself. This screening effect severely diminishes the influence of the back-gate potential on the channel potential, which manifests as a significantly reduced channel-to-body capacitance, $C_{cb}$.\n\nTherefore, for FinFET and GAA structures, the ratio $\\frac{C_{cb}}{C_g}$ is substantially smaller than in a planar device of comparable scale. As both derived expressions for $\\frac{\\partial V_T}{\\partial V_B}$ are proportional to this ratio (or a term containing it), the body effect is inherently and significantly suppressed in these advanced multi-gate architectures. This improved electrostatic integrity is a primary reason for their superior performance, including higher transconductance and near-ideal subthreshold swing.",

Therefore, the capacitance per unit length is\n$$\nC'_{\\mathrm{g}} = \\frac{\\lambda}{V} = \\frac{2 \\pi \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}}}{\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{r_{\\mathrm{g}}}{r_{\\mathrm{c}}}\\right)}.\n$$\nFor a finite gate length $L$, the total gate capacitance is\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{g}} = C'_{\\mathrm{g}} L = \\frac{2 \\pi \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}} L}{\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{r_{\\mathrm{g}}}{r_{\\mathrm{c}}}\\right)}.\n$$\n\nMutual electrostatic coupling between neighboring fins: Each fin’s gate shell can be treated as an isolated cylindrical conductor of radius $r_{\\mathrm{g}}$ embedded in a homogeneous medium of permittivity $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{sp}}$. The two-conductor solution in bipolar coordinates for two identical, parallel cylinders separated by center distance $p$ gives the per-unit-length capacitance (for opposite charges and potential difference $V$) as\n$$\nC'_{\\mathrm{c}} = \\frac{\\pi \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{sp}}}{\\operatorname{arccosh}\\!\\left(\\frac{p}{2 r_{\\mathrm{g}}}\\right)},\n$$\nvalid for $p > 2 r_{\\mathrm{g}}$. The total cross-capacitance is\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{c}} = C'_{\\mathrm{c}} L = \\frac{\\pi \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{sp}} L}{\\operatorname{arccosh}\\!\\left(\\frac{p}{2 r_{\\mathrm{g}}}\\right)}.\n$$\n\nInduced threshold shift by capacitive coupling: To determine the threshold shift $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{T}}$ on a victim fin due to a fixed neighbor gate bias $V_{\\mathrm{n}}$, consider the small-signal electrostatic node equation at the victim channel surface potential $\\phi_{\\mathrm{s}}$. Let the victim gate-to-channel capacitance be $C_{\\mathrm{g}}$ and the neighbor gate-to-victim channel cross-capacitance be $C_{\\mathrm{c}}$. Neglecting other capacitive paths for clarity (e.g., deep substrate), the incremental charge conservation at the channel node gives\n$$\n\\delta Q = C_{\\mathrm{g}} \\left( \\delta V_{\\mathrm{g}} - \\delta \\phi_{\\mathrm{s}} \\right) + C_{\\mathrm{c}} \\left( \\delta V_{\\mathrm{n}} - \\delta \\phi_{\\mathrm{s}} \\right).\n$$\nAt threshold, we hold $\\phi_{\\mathrm{s}}$ at its target value, so $\\delta \\phi_{\\mathrm{s}} = 0$ by definition of the threshold condition. Then a change in neighbor gate bias $\\delta V_{\\mathrm{n}}$ must be compensated by an adjustment of the victim gate bias $\\delta V_{\\mathrm{g}}$ to maintain the same $\\phi_{\\mathrm{s}}$. Setting $\\delta Q = 0$ at the threshold boundary,\n$$\n0 = C_{\\mathrm{g}} \\delta V_{\\mathrm{g}} + C_{\\mathrm{c}} \\delta V_{\\mathrm{n}}.\n$$\nThus the induced threshold shift on the victim gate is\n$$\n\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{T}} \\equiv \\delta V_{\\mathrm{g}} = - \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{c}}}{C_{\\mathrm{g}}} \\delta V_{\\mathrm{n}}.\n$$\nIf the neighbor bias is held at a static $V_{\\mathrm{n}}$ while the victim threshold is measured, the threshold is shifted by\n$$\n\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{T}} = - \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{c}}}{C_{\\mathrm{g}}} V_{\\mathrm{n}}.\n$$\nThe sign indicates that a positive neighbor gate bias reduces the victim gate voltage required to reach threshold; the magnitude is given by $| \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{T}} | = (C_{\\mathrm{c}}/C_{\\mathrm{g}}) |V_{\\mathrm{n}}|$.\n\nAlgorithmic steps for computation:\n- Compute $r_{\\mathrm{g}} = r_{\\mathrm{c}} + t_{\\mathrm{ox}}$.\n- Compute $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}} = \\kappa_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\varepsilon_{0}$ and $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{sp}} = \\kappa_{\\mathrm{sp}} \\varepsilon_{0}$.\n- Compute $C_{\\mathrm{g}} = \\frac{2 \\pi \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ox}} L}{\\ln\\!\\left(\\frac{r_{\\mathrm{g}}}{r_{\\mathrm{c}}}\\right)}$.\n- Ensure the geometric validity $p > 2 r_{\\mathrm{g}}$ and then compute $C_{\\mathrm{c}} = \\frac{\\pi \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{sp}} L}{\\operatorname{arccosh}\\!\\left(\\frac{p}{2 r_{\\mathrm{g}}}\\right)}$.\n- Compute $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{T}} = - \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{c}}}{C_{\\mathrm{g}}} V_{\\mathrm{n}}$.\n\nThe output per test case is the pair $[C_{\\mathrm{c}}, \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{T}}]$ in $\\mathrm{F}$ and $\\mathrm{V}$, respectively, printed as a single list over all cases with no spaces.",
