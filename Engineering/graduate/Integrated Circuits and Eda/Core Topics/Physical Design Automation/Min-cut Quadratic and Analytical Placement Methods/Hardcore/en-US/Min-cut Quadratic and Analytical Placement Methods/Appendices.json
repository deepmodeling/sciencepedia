In one spatial dimension, let there be three movable standard cells with unknown horizontal coordinates $x_{1}$, $x_{2}$, and $x_{3}$ (in micrometers), and two fixed terminals with known coordinates. The interconnect topology is given by two nets:\n- Net $\\mathcal{N}_{1}$ connects the pins of movable cells $1$ and $2$ and a fixed terminal $f_{1}$ located at $x_{f_{1}}=0$.\n- Net $\\mathcal{N}_{2}$ connects the pins of movable cells $2$ and $3$ and a fixed terminal $f_{2}$ located at $x_{f_{2}}=12$.\n\nAssume a one-dimensional placement model along the $x$-axis. Use the following fundamental base:\n- Springs model: Each pair of pins connected within a net contributes a spring with Hookean energy proportional to the squared difference of their $x$-coordinates. Specifically, under the clique expansion model for hyperedges, each net of cardinality $k$ is replaced by a complete graph on its $k$ pins, with unit spring constant $w=1$ on each pair.\n- The total quadratic energy is the sum of spring energies over all pairs. Minimization of this convex quadratic energy subject to fixed terminal positions yields linear normal equations of the form $L \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$, where $L$ is a symmetric positive definite matrix when the netlist includes fixed terminals that connect to the movable cells.\n\nTasks:\n1.

            "solution": "The problem is a valid instance of one-dimensional analytical placement, a standard topic in Electronic Design Automation (EDA). It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all necessary information is provided for a unique solution. We can proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem involves three movable cells with coordinates $x_1, x_2, x_3$ and two fixed terminals at $x_{f_1}=0$ and $x_{f_2}=12$. The connectivity is defined by two nets: $\\mathcal{N}_1 = \\{1, 2, f_1\\}$ and $\\mathcal{N}_2 = \\{2, 3, f_2\\}$.\n\n**1. Total Quadratic Energy $Q(\\mathbf{x})$**\n\nThe energy is modeled using the clique expansion model, where each net of cardinality $k$ is decomposed into a complete graph of $\\binom{k}{2}$ edges. Each edge corresponds to a spring with energy $w(x_i-x_j)^2$, where the spring constant is given as $w=1$.\n\nFor net $\\mathcal{N}_1 = \\{1, 2, f_1\\}$, the cardinality is $k=3$. The clique expansion results in $\\binom{3}{2}=3$ pairs: $(1, 2)$, $(1, f_1)$, and $(2, f_1)$. The energy contribution from $\\mathcal{N}_1$, denoted $Q_1$, is the sum of the energies of these three springs:\n$$Q_1 = (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_1 - x_{f_1})^2 + (x_2 - x_{f_1})^2$$\n\nFor net $\\mathcal{N}_2 = \\{2, 3, f_2\\}$, the cardinality is also $k=3$. The clique expansion results in $\\binom{3}{2}=3$ pairs: $(2, 3)$, $(2, f_2)$, and $(3, f_2)$. The energy contribution from $\\mathcal{N}_2$, denoted $Q_2$, is:\n$$Q_2 = (x_2 - x_3)^2 + (x_2 - x_{f_2})^2 + (x_3 - x_{f_2})^2$$\n\nThe total quadratic energy $Q(\\mathbf{x})$ is the sum of the energies from all nets, $Q(\\mathbf{x}) = Q_1 + Q_2$.\n$$Q(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_1 - x_{f_1})^2 + (x_2 - x_{f_1})^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + (x_2 - x_{f_2})^2 + (x_3 - x_{f_2})^2$$\n\nSubstituting the given fixed terminal positions, $x_{f_1}=0$ and $x_{f_2}=12$:\n$$Q(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (x_1 - x_2)^2 + (x_1 - 0)^2 + (x_2 - 0)^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + (x_2 - 12)^2 + (x_3 - 12)^2$$\n$$Q(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (x_1 - x_2)^2 + x_1^2 + x_2^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + (x_2 - 12)^2 + (x_3 - 12)^2$$\n\n**2. Derivation of the Linear System $L\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$**\n\nTo find the optimal coordinates that minimize the energy $Q(\\mathbf{x})$, we must find the stationary point where the gradient of $Q$ with respect to the vector of movable coordinates $\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, x_2, x_3)^T$ is zero. That is, $\\nabla Q = \\left(\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x_1}, \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x_2}, \\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x_3}\\right) = (0, 0, 0)$.\n\nWe compute the partial derivatives:\n\nFor $x_1$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x_1} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_1} \\left[ (x_1 - x_2)^2 + x_1^2 \\right] = 2(x_1 - x_2)(1) + 2x_1 = 4x_1 - 2x_2$$\n\nFor $x_2$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x_2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_2} \\left[ (x_1 - x_2)^2 + x_2^2 + (x_2 - x_3)^2 + (x_2 - 12)^2 \\right]$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x_2} = 2(x_1 - x_2)(-1) + 2x_2 + 2(x_2 - x_3)(1) + 2(x_2 - 12)(1)$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x_2} = -2x_1 + 2x_2 + 2x_2 + 2x_2 - 2x_3 + 2x_2 - 24 = -2x_1 + 8x_2 - 2x_3 - 24$$\n\nFor $x_3$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x_3} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x_3} \\left[ (x_2 - x_3)^2 + (x_3 - 12)^2 \\right] = 2(x_2 - x_3)(-1) + 2(x_3 - 12)(1)$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial Q}{\\partial x_3} = -2x_2 + 2x_3 + 2x_3 - 24 = -2x_2 + 4x_3 - 24$$\n\nSetting these derivatives to zero gives the system of linear equations:\n$$4x_1 - 2x_2 = 0$$\n$$-2x_1 + 8x_2 - 2x_3 = 24$$\n$$-2x_2 + 4x_3 = 24$$\n\nThis system is of the form $L \\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}$, where $\\mathbf{x} = \\begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{pmatrix}$. The coefficient matrix $L$ and the right-hand side vector $\\mathbf{b}$ are:\n$$L = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & -2 & 0 \\\\ -2 & 8 & -2 \\\\ 0 & -2 & 4 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\mathbf{b} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 24 \\\\ 24 \\end{pmatrix}$$\n\n**3. Solving the Linear System**\n\nWe solve the system of equations:\n1. $4x_1 - 2x_2 = 0$\n2. $-2x_1 + 8x_2 - 2x_3 = 24$\n3. $-2x_2 + 4x_3 = 24$\n\nFrom equation (1), we have $4x_1 = 2x_2$, which simplifies to $x_2 = 2x_1$.\n\nFrom equation (3), we can simplify by dividing by $2$ to get $-x_2 + 2x_3 = 12$, which gives $2x_3 = x_2 + 12$.\n\nNow, substitute $x_2 = 2x_1$ into the expression for $2x_3$:\n$2x_3 = (2x_1) + 12$, which implies $x_3 = x_1 + 6$.\n\nNext, we substitute both $x_2 = 2x_1$ and $x_3 = x_1 + 6$ into equation (2):\n$$-2x_1 + 8(2x_1) - 2(x_1 + 6) = 24$$\n$$-2x_1 + 16x_1 - 2x_1 - 12 = 24$$\n$$12x_1 = 36$$\n$$x_1 = 3$$\n\nNow we find $x_2$ and $x_3$ by back-substitution:\n$$x_2 = 2x_1 = 2(3) = 6$$\n$$x_3 = x_1 + 6 = 3 + 6 = 9$$\n\nThe optimal coordinates are $(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (3, 6, 9)$.\n\n**4. Physical Interpretation**\n\nThe stationary point equations can be interpreted as force-balance equations. For a given movable cell $i$, its optimal position $x_i$ is the weighted average of the positions of all other pins (movable or fixed) connected to it via clique-decomposed springs. The force-balance equation for cell $i$ is:\n$$(\\sum_{j \\neq i, \\text{connected}} w_{ij}) x_i = \\sum_{j \\neq i, \\text{connected}} w_{ij} x_j$$\nSince all weights $w_{ij}=1$, this simplifies to $x_i$ being the average position of its neighbors in the clique graph.\n- **Cell 1**: is connected to cell $2$ and terminal $f_1$. Its degree is $2$. Thus, $2x_1 = x_2 + x_{f_1}$. Using the calculated values: $2(3) = 6+0$. This holds.\n- **Cell 2**: is connected to cells $1, 3$ and terminals $f_1, f_2$. Its degree is $4$. Thus, $4x_2 = x_1 + x_3 + x_{f_1} + x_{f_2}$. Using the calculated values: $4(6) = 3+9+0+12 = 24$. This holds.\n- **Cell 3**: is connected to cell $2$ and terminal $f_2$. Its degree is $2$. Thus, $2x_3 = x_2 + x_{f_2}$. Using the calculated values: $2(9) = 6+12 = 18$. This holds.\n\nPhysically, each movable cell settles at the \"center of gravity\" of the components to which it is connected by springs. The solution $(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (3, 6, 9)$ places the movable cells at evenly spaced intervals between the fixed terminals at $0$ and $12$. The full arrangement is $x_{f_1}=0, x_1=3, x_2=6, x_3=9, x_{f_2}=12$. This perfect arithmetic progression arises from the symmetry in the connectivity.",

The netlist consists of two two-pin nets $N_1 = \\{1,2\\}$ and $N_2 = \\{2,3\\}$. The continuous wirelength objective is built from the log-sum-exp (LSE) approximation of the half-perimeter wirelength for each net in both $x$ and $y$ dimensions. Let the LSE smoothing parameter be $\\gamma = 0.5$. Define the LSE wirelength of a net $N$ as the sum of its $x$-component and $y$-component:\n$$\n\\mathrm{WL}_{\\mathrm{LSE}}(N) \\triangleq \\gamma \\ln\\!\\Bigg(\\sum_{i \\in N} \\exp\\!\\Big(\\frac{x_i}{\\gamma}\\Big)\\Bigg) + \\gamma \\ln\\!\\Bigg(\\sum_{i \\in N} \\exp\\!\\Big(-\\frac{x_i}{\\gamma}\\Big)\\Bigg) + \\gamma \\ln\\!\\Bigg(\\sum_{i \\in N} \\exp\\!\\Big(\\frac{y_i}{\\gamma}\\Big)\\Bigg) + \\gamma \\ln\\!\\Bigg(\\sum_{i \\in N} \\exp\\!\\Big(-\\frac{y_i}{\\gamma}\\Big)\\Bigg).\n$$\nThe total wirelength objective is $\\mathrm{WL}_{\\mathrm{LSE}}^{\\mathrm{tot}} \\triangleq \\sum_{N \\in \\{N_1, N_2\\}} \\mathrm{WL}_{\\mathrm{LSE}}(N)$.\n\nTo model spreading, use a single-bin density penalty centered at $(x_b, y_b) = (1.0, 1.0)$ with a separable isotropic Gaussian kernel of variance $\\sigma^2 = 1.0$. Let the cell areas be $a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = 1.0$ and the bin capacity be $C = 1.8$. Define the smooth density field contribution of cell $i$ as\n$$\nK_i \\triangleq \\exp\\!\\Bigg(-\\frac{(x_i - x_b)^{2} + (y_i - y_b)^{2}}{\\sigma^{2}}\\Bigg),\n$$\nand define the scalar density penalty energy\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{dens}} \\triangleq \\frac{1}{2}\\Bigg(\\sum_{i=1}^{3} a_i K_i - C\\Bigg)^{2}.\n$$\nThe objective to be minimized is\n$$\nf(\\mathbf{x}) \\triangleq \\mathrm{WL}_{\\mathrm{LSE}}^{\\mathrm{tot}}(\\mathbf{x}) + \\eta\\, E_{\\mathrm{dens}}(\\mathbf{x}),\n$$\nwith density weight $\\eta = 0.3$ and placement vector $\\mathbf{x} \\triangleq (x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, x_3, y_3)^{\\mathsf{T}}$.\n\nPerform one Nesterov accelerated gradient step with momentum $\\beta = 0.3$ and step size $\\alpha = 0.1$, using the standard two-sequence update\n$$\n\\mathbf{y}^{(k)} = \\mathbf{x}^{(k)} + \\beta\\big(\\mathbf{x}^{(k)} - \\mathbf{x}^{(k-1)}\\big), \\quad \\mathbf{x}^{(k+1)} = \\mathbf{y}^{(k)} - \\alpha\\, \\nabla f\\big(\\mathbf{y}^{(k)}\\big).\n$$\nThe current and previous placement vectors are\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}^{(k)} = \\big(1.2,\\, 0.8,\\, 0.0,\\, 1.5,\\, 2.0,\\, 0.2\\big)^{\\mathsf{T}}, \\quad \\mathbf{x}^{(k-1)} = \\big(1.0,\\, 1.0,\\, -0.2,\\, 1.3,\\, 1.8,\\, 0.0\\big)^{\\mathsf{T}}.\n$$\nStarting from the above definitions and fundamental calculus rules, compute $\\mathbf{y}^{(k)}$, derive the gradient $\\nabla f(\\mathbf{y}^{(k)})$ by combining the contributions from the LSE wirelength and the density penalty, and then compute $\\mathbf{x}^{(k+1)}$. Express your final answer as the ordered row vector of updated coordinates $(x_1^{(k+1)}, y_1^{(k+1)}, x_2^{(k+1)}, y_2^{(k+1)}, x_3^{(k+1)}, y_3^{(k+1)})$ and round each coordinate to four significant figures.
