This exercise demonstrates a crucial concept in algorithm design: the potential failure of a greedy, bottom-up approach to achieve a globally optimal solution.

            "problem": "Consider a technology mapping instance in Electronic Design Automation (EDA) for a Boolean tree with root computing the function $y = \\overline{(a \\cdot b) + (c \\cdot d)}$, where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are primary inputs, and $\\overline{(\\cdot)}$ denotes Boolean complement, $\\cdot$ denotes Boolean conjunction, and $+$ denotes Boolean disjunction. The tree has the structure of two binary conjunction nodes feeding a binary disjunction node, which then feeds a unary complement at the root.\n\nAssume an additive area cost model: the total area of a mapped tree is the sum of the areas of the selected standard cells that cover its nodes, with patterns not allowed to overlap. The standard-cell library $\\mathcal{L}$ contains the following cells and areas:\n- $AND2(x,y) = x \\cdot y$ with area $\\alpha_{\\text{AND2}} = 4$,\n- $OR2(x,y) = x + y$ with area $\\alpha_{\\text{OR2}} = 3$,\n- $INV(x) = \\overline{x}$ with area $\\alpha_{\\text{INV}} = 1$,\n- $NAND2(x,y) = \\overline{x \\cdot y}$ with area $\\alpha_{\\text{NAND2}} = 2$,\n- $AOI22(x,y,u,v) = \\overline{(x \\cdot y) + (u \\cdot v)}$ with area $\\alpha_{\\text{AOI22}} = 6$.\n\nA greedy bottom-up mapper operates as follows: at each internal node, it selects a locally area-minimizing cover for the subtree rooted at that node, committing to that choice and forbidding any subsequent overlapping cover by an ancestor.\n\nConstruct, within this concrete instance, a counterexample demonstrating that the greedy area-minimizing choice at the two conjunction subtrees leads to a suboptimal total area on the full tree. Specifically, compute the area gap $\\Delta A$ between:\n- the greedy mapping that minimizes each conjunction subtree independently, and\n- the globally optimal mapping of the entire tree.\n\nYour final answer must be the single real-valued number $\\Delta A$. No units are required.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the area gap, $\\Delta A$, between a mapping produced by a specific greedy algorithm and a globally optimal mapping for a given Boolean function and standard-cell library. The function is $y = \\overline{(a \\cdot b) + (c \\cdot d)}$.\n\nFirst, we represent the function as a subject tree, as specified. Let $n_1$ be the node computing $a \\cdot b$, $n_2$ be the node computing $c \\cdot d$, $n_3$ be the node computing the disjunction of the outputs of $n_1$ and $n_2$, and $n_4$ be the root node computing the complement of the output of $n_3$.\n\nNext, we analyze the greedy mapping procedure. The algorithm is defined as a bottom-up process where, at each internal node, a locally area-minimizing cover for the subtree rooted at that node is chosen and committed. This commitment forbids any ancestor node from creating an overlapping cover.\n\n1.  **Greedy mapping of the conjunction subtrees:**\n    The process begins at the lowest internal nodes, which are the conjunctions $n_1$ and $n_2$.\n    Consider the subtree rooted at $n_1$, which computes $a \\cdot b$. We need to find its minimum-area cover using the provided library $\\mathcal{L}$.\n    -   **Option 1:** Cover the subtree with a single $AND2$ cell. The area is $\\alpha_{\\text{AND2}} = 4$.\n    -   **Option 2:** Cover the subtree by implementing $a \\cdot b$ as $\\overline{\\overline{a \\cdot b}}$. This composition uses one $NAND2$ cell followed by one $INV$ cell. The total area is $\\alpha_{\\text{NAND2}} + \\alpha_{\\text{INV}} = 2 + 1 = 3$.\n\n    The locally area-minimizing choice is Option 2, with an area of $3$. The greedy algorithm commits to this choice. The same logic applies to the symmetric subtree rooted at node $n_2$, which computes $c \\cdot d$. Its minimal local cover also costs $3$.\n    After this step, the lower portion of the tree is covered by two instances of the ($NAND2+INV$) circuit, with a combined area of $3 + 3 = 6$. The outputs of these committed blocks are the signals $s_1 = a \\cdot b$ and $s_2 = c \\cdot d$.\n\n2.  **Greedy mapping of the remaining tree:**\n    The remaining part of the computation is $y = \\overline{s_1 + s_2}$. This corresponds to nodes $n_3$ (OR) and $n_4$ (INV). Since the subtrees for $s_1$ and $s_2$ are already covered and committed, the mapper can only cover the remaining nodes.\n    -   The disjunction $s_1 + s_2$ (node $n_3$) is covered by an $OR2$ cell, with area $\\alpha_{\\text{OR2}} = 3$.\n    -   The final inversion (node $n_4$) is covered by an $INV$ cell, with area $\\alpha_{\\text{INV}} = 1$.\n    The cost for covering the upper part of the tree is $\\alpha_{\\text{OR2}} + \\alpha_{\\text{INV}} = 3 + 1 = 4$.\n\n3.  **Total Area of the Greedy Mapping ($A_{\\text{greedy}}$):**\n    The total area is the sum of the costs of the committed, non-overlapping covers.\n    $$A_{\\text{greedy}} = (\\alpha_{\\text{NAND2}} + \\alpha_{\\text{INV}}) + (\\alpha_{\\text{NAND2}} + \\alpha_{\\text{INV}}) + \\alpha_{\\text{OR2}} + \\alpha_{\\text{INV}}$$\n    $$A_{\\text{greedy}} = (2 + 1) + (2 + 1) + 3 + 1 = 3 + 3 + 4 = 10$$\n    This demonstrates the suboptimal nature of the greedy choices. The local optimization at the $AND$ nodes (choosing a cover of area $3$ over $4$) leads to a higher total cost.\n\nNext, we determine the globally optimal mapping by finding the cover with the minimum possible total area for the entire tree. We must consider all valid non-overlapping tilings.\n\n1.  **Covering with a complex gate:**\n    The library contains the cell $AOI22(x,y,u,v) = \\overline{(x \\cdot y) + (u \\cdot v)}$. This cell perfectly matches the entire function $y = \\overline{(a \\cdot b) + (c \\cdot d)}$ with the substitution $x=a, y=b, u=c, v=d$.\n    The area for this cover is $\\alpha_{\\text{AOI22}} = 6$.\n\n2.  **Covering with other combinations:**\n    We must ensure no other combination of cells yields a smaller area.\n    -   The greedy solution has an area of $10$.\n    -   An alternative using $AND2$ gates for the subtrees: $A = \\alpha_{\\text{AND2}} + \\alpha_{\\text{AND2}} + \\alpha_{\\text{OR2}} + \\alpha_{\\text{INV}} = 4 + 4 + 3 + 1 = 12$.\n    -   Using De Morgan's law: $y = \\overline{(a \\cdot b) + (c \\cdot d)} = (\\overline{a \\cdot b}) \\cdot (\\overline{c \\cdot d})$. This can be implemented with two $NAND2$ gates feeding into an $AND2$ gate. The total area is $\\alpha_{\\text{NAND2}} + \\alpha_{\\text{NAND2}} + \\alpha_{\\text{AND2}} = 2 + 2 + 4 = 8$.\n    -   A variation on the De Morgan's law implementation, where the final $AND2$ is implemented as a $NAND2$ followed by an $INV$: $A = \\alpha_{\\text{NAND2}} + \\alpha_{\\text{NAND2}} + (\\alpha_{\\text{NAND2}} + \\alpha_{\\text{INV}}) = 2 + 2 + (2 + 1) = 7$.\n\n3.  **Total Area of the Optimal Mapping ($A_{\\text{opt}}$):**\n    Comparing the total areas of all valid covers found: $6$, $7$, $8$, $10$, and $12$. The minimum area is $6$.\n    Therefore, the globally optimal area is $A_{\\text{opt}} = 6$. This is achieved by using the single $AOI22$ cell.\n\nFinally, we compute the area gap $\\Delta A$ as requested.\n$$\\Delta A = A_{\\text{greedy}} - A_{\\text{opt}}$$\n$$\\Delta A = 10 - 6 = 4$$\nThe greedy strategy, by making locally optimal choices at the conjunction nodes, leads to a solution that is suboptimal by an area of $4$ compared to the true global optimum.",

            "problem": "In Electronic Design Automation (EDA) for integrated circuits, technology mapping to a standard-cell library frequently employs equivalence under Negation-Permutation-Negation (NPN) transformations for Boolean matching. Consider a Boolean function $f(x,y,z)$ of three binary inputs, represented by its truth table in the fixed row order $(x,y,z)$ taking values $(0,0,0)$, $(0,0,1)$, $(0,1,0)$, $(0,1,1)$, $(1,0,0)$, $(1,0,1)$, $(1,1,0)$, $(1,1,1)$. The truth table entries are given as:\n- $f(0,0,0) = 0$,\n- $f(0,0,1) = 0$,\n- $f(0,1,0) = 0$,\n- $f(0,1,1) = 0$,\n- $f(1,0,0) = 0$,\n- $f(1,0,1) = 1$,\n- $f(1,1,0) = 0$,\n- $f(1,1,1) = 0$.\n\nUnder NPN transformations, one may arbitrarily permute the inputs (element of the symmetric group $S_3$), independently complement any subset of inputs, and optionally complement the output. The NPN canonical form of $f$ is defined as the lexicographically minimal truth table (equivalently, the minimal binary integer value when the table is read in the specified row order) among all functions obtained from $f$ by such NPN transformations.\n\nStarting from the above $f$, construct its NPN canonical form by determining a specific input permutation, input polarity assignment, and output polarity that yield the minimal binary integer value of the transformed truth table. Then, express the canonical form as the base-$10$ value of the $8$-bit binary number that results from reading the transformed truth table in the fixed row order above, with the least significant bit corresponding to $(x,y,z)=(0,0,0)$ and the most significant bit corresponding to $(x,y,z)=(1,1,1)$. Provide the final canonical integer value. No rounding is required. In addition, within your solution, explicitly state the chosen input permutation (as a permutation of indices of $(x,y,z)$), the input polarity vector (indicating which inputs are complemented), and the output polarity (complemented or not), and justify why the obtained truth table is minimal under NPN transformations. The final reported answer must be a single base-$10$ integer.",
            "solution": "The problem requires finding the NPN (Negation-Permutation-Negation) canonical form of a given three-input Boolean function, $f(x,y,z)$. The canonical form is defined as the function corresponding to the lexicographically minimal truth table among all functions reachable from $f$ via NPN transformations. The final answer is the base-$10$ integer representation of this canonical truth table.\n\nFirst, we represent the given function $f(x,y,z)$ by its truth table. The inputs $(x,y,z)$ are ordered from $(0,0,0)$ to $(1,1,1)$. The given values are:\n$f(0,0,0) = 0$\n$f(0,0,1) = 0$\n$f(0,1,0) = 0$\n$f(0,1,1) = 0$\n$f(1,0,0) = 0$\n$f(1,0,1) = 1$\n$f(1,1,0) = 0$\n$f(1,1,1) = 0$\n\nThe truth vector $V_f$ is the sequence of function values in the specified order:\n$$V_f = (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0)$$\nThis function is non-zero only for the input vector $(x,y,z) = (1,0,1)$. Therefore, the function can be expressed in disjunctive normal form as a single minterm:\n$$f(x,y,z) = x \\land \\neg y \\land z$$\nThe problem specifies that the truth vector is to be interpreted as an $8$-bit binary number where the LSB corresponds to input $(0,0,0)$ and the MSB to input $(1,1,1)$. Let the truth vector be $(b_0, b_1, \\dots, b_7)$, where $b_i$ is the function value for the input combination corresponding to the integer $i$. The binary number is $b_7 b_6 b_5 b_4 b_3 b_2 b_1 b_0$.\nFor the given function $f$, the truth vector is $V_f=(b_0, \\dots, b_7)=(0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0)$. The corresponding binary number is $00100000_2$, which has a base-$10$ value of $2^5 = 32$.\n\nAn NPN transformation creates a new function $g(x,y,z)$ from $f(x,y,z)$ according to the relation:\n$$g(x,y,z) = c_{out} \\oplus f(\\pi(x,y,z) \\oplus C)$$\nwhere:\n1.  $\\pi$ is a permutation of the input variables $(x,y,z)$. There are $3! = 6$ such permutations.\n2.  $C = (c_x, c_y, c_z)$ is an input negation vector, where each $c_i \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. A value of $1$ indicates negation of the corresponding variable. There are $2^3 = 8$ such vectors.\n3.  $c_{out} \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ is the output negation. A value of $1$ indicates the output is complemented. There are $2$ choices for output polarity.\n\nThe total number of NPN transformations is $6 \\times 8 \\times 2 = 96$. The set of all functions NPN-equivalent to $f$ is called its NPN class. The NPN canonical form is the member of this class with the lexicographically smallest truth vector, which corresponds to the smallest integer value.\n\nThe Hamming weight of a truth vector is the number of '$1$'s it contains. For $f$, the weight is $w(f) = 1$. The permutation of inputs and the negation of inputs are bijections on the input space, so they merely reorder the entries of the truth table. Thus, they preserve the Hamming weight. The only transformation that changes the weight is output negation. If $w(f) = k$ and $n$ is the number of inputs, complementing the output yields a function $f'$ with weight $w(f') = 2^n - k$.\nFor our function $f$ with $n=3$ and $w(f)=1$, any NPN-equivalent function $g$ must have a weight of either $w(g)=1$ or $w(g) = 2^3 - 1 = 7$.\n\nTo find the minimal integer value, we analyze these two cases:\nCase 1: $w(g) = 1$.\nA function with weight $1$ has a single '$1$' in its $8$-bit truth vector. To minimize the integer value $b_7 b_6 b_5 b_4 b_3 b_2 b_1 b_0$, this single '$1$' must be placed in the lowest possible bit position, which is the LSB ($b_0$). This corresponds to the truth vector:\n$$V_{min,1} = (1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)$$\nThe corresponding binary number is $00000001_2$, and its base-$10$ value is $1$. The function for this truth vector is $g_1(x,y,z) = \\neg x \\land \\neg y \\land \\neg z$, which is true only for $(x,y,z)=(0,0,0)$.\n\nCase 2: $w(g) = 7$.\nA function with weight $7$ has a single '$0$' in its $8$-bit truth vector. To minimize the integer value, the '$0$' should be placed in the highest possible bit position, which is the MSB ($b_7$). This corresponds to the truth vector:\n$$V_{min,7} = (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0)$$\nThe corresponding binary number is $01111111_2$, and its base-$10$ value is $2^7 - 1 = 127$. The function for this truth vector is $g_7(x,y,z) = \\neg(x \\land y \\land z)$.\n\nComparing the minimal values achievable in each case, we have $\\min(1, 127) = 1$. Therefore, the NPN canonical form must correspond to the integer value $1$, provided that the function $g_1(x,y,z) = \\neg x \\land \\neg y \\land \\neg z$ is indeed in the NPN class of $f$.\n\nWe now demonstrate that $f$ can be transformed into $g_1$. We need to find a permutation $\\pi$, an input negation vector $C$, and an output negation $c_{out}$ such that $g_1(x,y,z) = c_{out} \\oplus f(\\pi(x,y,z) \\oplus C)$.\nAs established, we must use $c_{out}=0$ to preserve the weight of $1$. So, we need to solve:\n$$\\neg x \\land \\neg y \\land \\neg z = f(\\pi(x \\oplus c_x, y \\oplus c_y, z \\oplus c_z))$$\nThe left-hand side is $1$ only when $(x,y,z)=(0,0,0)$. The original function $f(a,b,c)=a \\land \\neg b \\land c$ is $1$ only when its arguments are $(a,b,c)=(1,0,1)$.\nLet's try the identity permutation $\\pi(x,y,z) = (x,y,z)$. The equation becomes:\n$$\\neg x \\land \\neg y \\land \\neg z = f(x \\oplus c_x, y \\oplus c_y, z \\oplus c_z)$$\n$$\\neg x \\land \\neg y \\land \\neg z = (x \\oplus c_x) \\land \\neg(y \\oplus c_y) \\land (z \\oplus c_z)$$\nFor this equality to hold for all $(x,y,z)$, the expressions must be logically equivalent. Let's expand the right side:\nRHS $= (x \\oplus c_x) \\land (y \\oplus \\neg c_y) \\land (z \\oplus c_z)$\nTo match the LHS $\\neg x \\land \\neg y \\land \\neg z$, which is $(x \\oplus 1) \\land (y \\oplus 1) \\land (z \\oplus 1)$, we can equate the terms:\n$x \\oplus c_x = x \\oplus 1 \\implies c_x = 1$\n$y \\oplus \\neg c_y = y \\oplus 1 \\implies \\neg c_y = 1 \\implies c_y = 0$\n$z \\oplus c_z = z \\oplus 1 \\implies c_z = 1$\nThis gives the input negation vector $C=(1,0,1)$. Let's verify this transformation:\n$$f(x \\oplus 1, y \\oplus 0, z \\oplus 1) = f(\\neg x, y, \\neg z)$$\nSubstituting into the formula for $f(a,b,c)=a \\land \\neg b \\land c$:\n$$f(\\neg x, y, \\neg z) = (\\neg x) \\land (\\neg y) \\land (\\neg z)$$\nThis is exactly the target function $g_1(x,y,z)$. Thus, we have found a valid NPN transformation:\n-   **Input Permutation:** Identity. The variables $(x,y,z)$ are mapped to $(x,y,z)$. The permutation of indices $\\{1,2,3\\}$ is the identity permutation.\n-   **Input Polarity Vector:** $(1,0,1)$. This signifies that input $x$ is complemented, $y$ is not, and $z$ is complemented.\n-   **Output Polarity:** Not complemented ($c_{out}=0$).\n\nThis transformation yields the function $g_1(x,y,z)=\\neg x \\land \\neg y \\land \\neg z$, whose truth vector is $(1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0)$. Interpreted as a binary number $b_7...b_0$, this is $00000001_2$. The base-$10$ value is $1$. This is the minimal possible integer value for a non-constant function, and therefore it represents the NPN canonical form.\n\nThe canonical form is thus represented by the base-$10$ integer $1$.",

Rounding to four significant figures gives $26.33 \\text{ ps}$.\n\n**Part 2: Verification of Continuity at $s_{\\text{in}} = 50 \\text{ ps}$ and $C_{\\text{L}} = 8 \\text{ fF}$**\n\nHere, the input slew $s = 50 \\text{ ps}$ coincides with a breakpoint, $s = s_{hi}$. The general bilinear interpolation formula for a point $(s, C)$ in the cell $[s_{lo}, s_{hi}] \\times [C_{lo}, C_{hi}]$ is:\n$$t_{\\text{pd}}(s, C) = t_{11}(1-s_{norm})(1-C_{norm}) + t_{12}(1-s_{norm})C_{norm} + t_{21}s_{norm}(1-C_{norm}) + t_{22}s_{norm}C_{norm}$$\nwhere $s_{norm} = \\frac{s - s_{lo}}{s_{hi} - s_{lo}}$ and $C_{norm} = \\frac{C - C_{lo}}{C_{hi} - C_{lo}}$.\n\nWhen $s = s_{hi} = 50 \\text{ ps}$, the normalized slew coordinate is $s_{norm} = \\frac{50 - 20}{50 - 20} = 1$. The term $(1-s_{norm})$ becomes $0$.\nThe general formula simplifies as follows:\n$$t_{\\text{pd}}(s_{hi}, C) = t_{11}(0)(1-C_{norm}) + t_{12}(0)C_{norm} + t_{21}(1)(1-C_{norm}) + t_{22}(1)C_{norm}$$\n$$t_{\\text{pd}}(s_{hi}, C) = t_{21}(1-C_{norm}) + t_{22}C_{norm} = t_{21} + (t_{22} - t_{21})C_{norm}$$\nSubstituting the definition of $C_{norm}$:\n$$t_{\\text{pd}}(s_{hi}, C) = t_{\\text{pd}}(s_{hi}, C_{lo}) + (t_{\\text{pd}}(s_{hi}, C_{hi}) - t_{\\text{pd}}(s_{hi}, C_{lo})) \\frac{C - C_{lo}}{C_{hi} - C_{lo}}$$\nThis is precisely the formula for one-dimensional linear interpolation along the line of constant slew $s=s_{hi}$. As calculated in Step 1.2, for $C=8 \\text{ fF}$, this gives $t_{\\text{pd}}(50, 8) = \\frac{92}{3} \\text{ ps}$. This confirms that the bilinear interpolation is continuous and reduces to a 1D linear interpolation at the boundary.\n\n**Part 3: Verification of Continuity at $C_{\\text{L}} = 6 \\text{ fF}$ and $s_{\\text{in}} = 35 \\text{ ps}$**\n\nHere, the output load $C = 6 \\text{ fF}$ coincides with a breakpoint, $C = C_{lo}$.\nUsing the same interpolation cell and general formula as before, when $C = C_{lo} = 6 \\text{ fF}$, the normalized load coordinate is $C_{norm} = \\frac{6 - 6}{12 - 6} = 0$. The term $(1-C_{norm})$ becomes $1$.\nThe general formula simplifies as follows:\n$$t_{\\text{pd}}(s, C_{lo}) = t_{11}(1-s_{norm})(1) + t_{12}(1-s_{norm})(0) + t_{21}s_{norm}(1) + t_{22}s_{norm}(0)$$\n$$t_{\\text{pd}}(s, C_{lo}) = t_{11}(1-s_{norm}) + t_{21}s_{norm} = t_{11} + (t_{21} - t_{11})s_{norm}$$\nSubstituting the definition of $s_{norm}$:\n$$t_{\\text{pd}}(s, C_{lo}) = t_{\\text{pd}}(s_{lo}, C_{lo}) + (t_{\\text{pd}}(s_{hi}, C_{lo}) - t_{\\text{pd}}(s_{lo}, C_{lo})) \\frac{s - s_{lo}}{s_{hi} - s_{lo}}$$\nThis is the formula for one-dimensional linear interpolation along the line of constant load $C=C_{lo}$.\nFor $s = 35 \\text{ ps}$:\n$$t_{\\text{pd}}(35, 6) = 18 \\text{ ps} + (26 \\text{ ps} - 18 \\text{ ps}) \\frac{35 \\text{ ps} - 20 \\text{ ps}}{50 \\text{ ps} - 20 \\text{ ps}} = 18 + 8 \\left(\\frac{15}{30}\\right) = 18 + 4 = 22 \\text{ ps}$$\nThis result confirms that the bilinear interpolation also reduces to a 1D linear interpolation along the other boundary of the cell, demonstrating continuity.\n\nThe interpolated propagation delay for $s_{\\text{in}} = 35 \\text{ ps}$ and $C_{\\text{L}} = 8 \\text{ fF}$ is $\\frac{79}{3} \\text{ ps}$. Rounding to four significant figures yields $26.33 \\text{ ps}$.",
