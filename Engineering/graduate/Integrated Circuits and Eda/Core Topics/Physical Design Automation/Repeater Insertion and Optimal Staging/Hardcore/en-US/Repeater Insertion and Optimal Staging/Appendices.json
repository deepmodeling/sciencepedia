The premises are physically and mathematically sound, the question is well-defined, and all necessary information for a solution is provided. I will now proceed with a full derivation and calculation.\n\n**Derivation of Elmore Delay**\n\nThe Elmore delay is a first-order approximation for the propagation delay in an $RC$ circuit. For a general $RC$ tree, the Elmore delay at a specific node $i$ is defined as the first moment of the impulse response at that node. It can be calculated as:\n$$T_{Di} = \\sum_k R_{ki} C_k$$\nwhere the summation is over all capacitors $C_k$ in the circuit, and $R_{ki}$ is the resistance of the path from the voltage source to capacitor $C_k$ that is *common* to the path from the source to the node of interest $i$.\n\nTo apply this to a continuous, uniform distributed $RC$ line of length $L$, we transition from a discrete sum to an integral. We model the wire as extending from position $x=0$ (the input source) to $x=L$ (the open-circuited far end).\n\nConsider an infinitesimal segment of the wire of length $dx$ at a position $x$. This segment has an infinitesimal capacitance $dC = c \\cdot dx$, where $c$ is the capacitance per unit length.\n\nWe wish to find the Elmore delay at the far end of the wire, i.e., at the node located at $x=L$. According to the Elmore delay definition, we must integrate over all infinitesimal capacitors along the wire. The delay is:\n$$T_D(L) = \\int_{\\text{wire}} R_{\\text{path}}(x, L) \\, dC(x)$$\nHere, $dC(x) = c \\, dx$ is the infinitesimal capacitance at position $x$. The term $R_{\\text{path}}(x, L)$ represents the resistance of the path from the source (at $x=0$) to the location of $dC$ (at $x$) that is common to the path from the source to the far-end node (at $L$).\n\nFor a simple linear wire, the path from the source to any point $x$ is a subset of the path from the source to the end $L$. Therefore, this common path resistance is simply the resistance from the source at $x=0$ to the point $x$. Let's call this resistance $R(x)$.\n\nThe resistance $R(x)$ is calculated by integrating the resistance-per-unit-length, $r$, from the source up to position $x$:\n$$R(x) = \\int_0^x r \\, d\\xi = r \\int_0^x d\\xi = rx$$\nThis expression is the \"path resistance seen by each infinitesimal capacitance element\" located at position $x$.\n\nNow, we can substitute $dC(x) = c \\, dx$ and $R(x) = rx$ into the integral for the Elmore delay. The integral is evaluated over the entire length of the wire, from $x=0$ to $x=L$. This integral is the continuum limit of the discrete summation and is justified by considering the wire as an infinite series of infinitesimal $RC$ segments.\n$$T_D(L) = \\int_0^L R(x) \\, dC(x) = \\int_0^L (rx)(c \\, dx)$$\nWe can pull the constants $r$ and $c$ out of the integral:\n$$T_D(L) = rc \\int_0^L x \\, dx$$\nEvaluating the integral gives:\n$$T_D(L) = rc \\left[ \\frac{x^2}{2} \\right]_0^L = rc \\left( \\frac{L^2}{2} - \\frac{0^2}{2} \\right)$$\n$$T_D(L) = \\frac{1}{2} rc L^2$$\nThis is the final expression for the Elmore delay to the far end of a uniform distributed $RC$ wire. This result explicitly demonstrates that the delay scales quadratically with the length of the wire, i.e., $T_D(L) \\propto L^2$.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe are given the following parameters:\n- $L = 10\\ \\mathrm{mm}$\n- $r = 0.1\\ \\Omega/\\mathrm{\\mu m}$\n- $c = 0.2\\ \\mathrm{fF}/\\mathrm{\\mu m}$\n\nTo perform the calculation, we must convert all values to a consistent set of units. We will use the base SI units (meters, ohms, farads, seconds).\n- Length: $L = 10\\ \\mathrm{mm} = 10 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m} = 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m}$.\n- Resistance per unit length: $r = 0.1\\ \\frac{\\Omega}{\\mu\\mathrm{m}} = 0.1\\ \\frac{\\Omega}{10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}} = 0.1 \\times 10^6\\ \\Omega/\\mathrm{m} = 10^5\\ \\Omega/\\mathrm{m}$.\n- Capacitance per unit length: $c = 0.2\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{fF}}{\\mu\\mathrm{m}} = 0.2 \\times 10^{-15}\\ \\frac{\\mathrm{F}}{10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}} = 0.2 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{F}/\\mathrm{m} = 2 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{F}/\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the derived formula:\n$$T_D = \\frac{1}{2} rc L^2$$\n$$T_D = \\frac{1}{2} (10^5\\ \\Omega/\\mathrm{m}) (2 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{F}/\\mathrm{m}) (10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m})^2$$\n$$T_D = \\frac{1}{2} (10^5) (2 \\times 10^{-10}) (10^{-4})\\ \\mathrm{s}$$\nThe units combine as $(\\Omega/\\mathrm{m}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{F}/\\mathrm{m}) \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^2 = \\Omega \\cdot \\mathrm{F} = \\mathrm{s}$, which is correct.\n$$T_D = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 2 \\times 10^{5 - 10 - 4}\\ \\mathrm{s}$$\n$$T_D = 1 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{s}$$\nThis result is equal to $1$ nanosecond ($ns$). The problem requires the answer in picoseconds ($ps$). Since $1\\ \\mathrm{ns} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{ps}$, the delay is:\n$$T_D = 1000\\ \\mathrm{ps}$$\nThe problem asks for the result to be rounded to four significant figures. The exact answer is $1000$. To express this unambiguously with four significant figures, we write it in scientific notation.\n$$T_D = 1.000 \\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{ps}$$",

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded optimization problem within the field of electronic design automation for integrated circuits. All necessary parameters and models are provided and are consistent with standard first-order approximations.\n\nThe goal is to find the optimal number of repeaters, $N^*$, and the optimal segment length, $l^*$, that minimize the total propagation delay of a signal along a wire of total length $L$.\n\nFirst, we establish the Elmore delay model for a single segment of the repeated interconnect. A segment consists of a driver buffer, a length of wire $l$, and the input of the next buffer. The total number of segments is $N$, where $l = L/N$.\n\nThe components of delay for a single segment driven by a buffer are:\n1.  The delay caused by the driver's output resistance, $R_{\\mathrm{drv}}$. This resistance drives its own output parasitic capacitance, the capacitance of the wire segment, and the input capacitance of the next buffer.\n2.  The delay inherent to the distributed RC nature of the wire segment itself.\n\nLet us formalize the total capacitance load on the driver.

This configuration effectively balances the delays to the two sinks.\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The minimal delay is exactly $483\\,\\text{ps}$. To express this with four significant figures, we write it as $483.0\\,\\text{ps}$.",
