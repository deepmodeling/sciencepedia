            "problem": "Consider a two-layer channel routing instance from Electronic Design Automation (EDA) in which horizontal tracks are assigned to route nets between a top row and a bottom row across a set of uniformly spaced columns indexed by $c \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 17\\}$. Let the set of nets be $\\{n_1, n_2, n_3, n_4, n_5, n_6, n_7, n_8\\}$. A net may have multiple pins on either the top or bottom row. For each column $c$, the top-row pin assignment is denoted $T(c)$ and the bottom-row pin assignment is denoted $B(c)$, with the convention that if a row has no pin at column $c$, the assignment is empty.\n\nThe pin assignments are as follows:\n- Top row: $T(1)=n_1$, $T(2)=n_2$, $T(3)=n_3$, $T(4)$ empty, $T(5)=n_4$, $T(6)=n_2$, $T(7)=n_5$, $T(8)=n_6$, $T(9)$ empty, $T(10)=n_7$, $T(11)=n_3$, $T(12)=n_8$, $T(13)$ empty, $T(14)=n_5$, $T(15)=n_1$, $T(16)=n_4$, $T(17)$ empty.\n- Bottom row: $B(1)$ empty, $B(2)=n_5$, $B(3)=n_1$, $B(4)=n_6$, $B(5)$ empty, $B(6)=n_7$, $B(7)$ empty, $B(8)=n_2$, $B(9)=n_4$, $B(10)$ empty, $B(11)=n_8$, $B(12)=n_3$, $B(13)=n_5$, $B(14)$ empty, $B(15)=n_6$, $B(16)=n_2$, $B(17)=n_7$.\n\nFundamental definitions to be used:\n- For each net $n_i$, define its horizontal interval as $[l_i, r_i]$, where $l_i$ is the minimum column index at which any pin of $n_i$ appears (top or bottom row) and $r_i$ is the maximum such column index.\n- Two intervals $[l_i, r_i]$ and $[l_j, r_j]$ are nested if $l_j \\leq l_i$ and $r_i \\leq r_j$, meaning $[l_i, r_i]$ is completely contained in $[l_j, r_j]$. They are disjoint if $r_i  l_j$ or $r_j  l_i$.\n- The channel density $D$ is defined as $D = \\max_{c \\in \\{1, \\dots, 17\\}} \\delta(c)$, where $\\delta(c)$ is the number of nets $n_i$ whose intervals satisfy $l_i \\leq c \\leq r_i$.\n\nTask:\n1.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem from the field of Electronic Design Automation (EDA), with all necessary information and definitions provided for its solution.\n\nThe solution proceeds by following the three tasks outlined in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we compute the horizontal interval $[l_i, r_i]$ for each net $n_i$. The interval is defined by the minimum column index, $l_i$, and the maximum column index, $r_i$, where the net has a pin. The pin assignments are given for the top row, $T(c)$, and bottom row, $B(c)$, for columns $c \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, 17\\}$.\n\nFor net $n_1$: Pins are at $T(1)$, $B(3)$, and $T(15)$. The set of column indices is $\\{1, 3, 15\\}$. Thus, $l_1 = \\min\\{1, 3, 15\\} = 1$ and $r_1 = \\max\\{1, 3, 15\\} = 15$. The interval is $[1, 15]$.\n\nFor net $n_2$: Pins are at $T(2)$, $T(6)$, $B(8)$, and $B(16)$. The set of column indices is $\\{2, 6, 8, 16\\}$. Thus, $l_2 = \\min\\{2, 6, 8, 16\\} = 2$ and $r_2 = \\max\\{2, 6, 8, 16\\} = 16$. The interval is $[2, 16]$.\n\nFor net $n_3$: Pins are at $T(3)$, $T(11)$, and $B(12)$. The set of column indices is $\\{3, 11, 12\\}$. Thus, $l_3 = \\min\\{3, 11, 12\\} = 3$ and $r_3 = \\max\\{3, 11, 12\\} = 12$. The interval is $[3, 12]$.\n\nFor net $n_4$: Pins are at $T(5)$, $B(9)$, and $T(16)$. The set of column indices is $\\{5, 9, 16\\}$. Thus, $l_4 = \\min\\{5, 9, 16\\} = 5$ and $r_4 = \\max\\{5, 9, 16\\} = 16$. The interval is $[5, 16]$.\n\nFor net $n_5$: Pins are at $B(2)$, $T(7)$, $B(13)$, and $T(14)$. The set of column indices is $\\{2, 7, 13, 14\\}$. Thus, $l_5 = \\min\\{2, 7, 13, 14\\} = 2$ and $r_5 = \\max\\{2, 7, 13, 14\\} = 14$. The interval is $[2, 14]$.\n\nFor net $n_6$: Pins are at $B(4)$, $T(8)$, and $B(15)$. The set of column indices is $\\{4, 8, 15\\}$. Thus, $l_6 = \\min\\{4, 8, 15\\} = 4$ and $r_6 = \\max\\{4, 8, 15\\} = 15$. The interval is $[4, 15]$.\n\nFor net $n_7$: Pins are at $B(6)$, $T(10)$, and $B(17)$. The set of column indices is $\\{6, 10, 17\\}$. Thus, $l_7 = \\min\\{6, 10, 17\\} = 6$ and $r_7 = \\max\\{6, 10, 17\\} = 17$. The interval is $[6, 17]$.\n\nFor net $n_8$: Pins are at $B(11)$ and $T(12)$. The set of column indices is $\\{11, 12\\}$. Thus, $l_8 = \\min\\{11, 12\\} = 11$ and $r_8 = \\max\\{11, 12\\} = 12$. The interval is $[11, 12]$.\n\nSummary of intervals:\n$n_1: [1, 15]$\n$n_2: [2, 16]$\n$n_3: [3, 12]$\n$n_4: [5, 16]$\n$n_5: [2, 14]$\n$n_6: [4, 15]$\n$n_7: [6, 17]$\n$n_8: [11, 12]$\n\nSecond, we analyze the relationships between these intervals.\nTwo intervals $[l_i, r_i]$ and $[l_j, r_j]$ are disjoint if their intersection is empty, i.e., $r_i  l_j$ or $r_j  l_i$. We observe that for every interval $[l_i, r_i]$, the range $[11, 12]$ is a subset of it (or the interval itself in the case of $n_8$). Since all intervals contain the columns $11$ and $12$, no two intervals are disjoint.\n\nTwo intervals are nested if one is completely contained within the other. We can identify several nested relationships. For example, the interval for $n_8$, which is $[11, 12]$, is nested within the interval for $n_3$, which is $[3, 12]$, because $l_3 = 3 \\leq l_8 = 11$ and $r_8 = 12 \\leq r_3 = 12$. In turn, the interval for $n_3$, $[3, 12]$, is nested within the interval for $n_5$, $[2, 14]$, since $l_5=2 \\leq l_3=3$ and $r_3=12 \\leq r_5=14$. Many other pairs of intervals simply overlap without being nested, such as $[1, 15]$ and $[2, 16]$.\n\nThird, we compute the channel density $D$. The channel density is defined as $D = \\max_{c \\in \\{1, \\dots, 17\\}} \\delta(c)$, where $\\delta(c)$ is the local density at column $c$. The value $\\delta(c)$ is the number of nets whose horizontal interval $[l_i, r_i]$ contains the column $c$, i.e., $l_i \\leq c \\leq r_i$. We can compute $\\delta(c)$ for each column $c$ from $1$ to $17$.\n\n$\\delta(1) = 1$ (net $n_1$)\n$\\delta(2) = 3$ (nets $n_1, n_2, n_5$)\n$\\delta(3) = 4$ (nets $n_1, n_2, n_3, n_5$)\n$\\delta(4) = 5$ (nets $n_1, n_2, n_3, n_5, n_6$)\n$\\delta(5) = 6$ (nets $n_1, n_2, n_3, n_4, n_5, n_6$)\n$\\delta(6) = 7$ (nets $n_1, n_2, n_3, n_4, n_5, n_6, n_7$)\n$\\delta(7) = 7$ (same as at $c=6$)\n$\\delta(8) = 7$ (same as at $c=6$)\n$\\delta(9) = 7$ (same as at $c=6$)\n$\\delta(10) = 7$ (same as at $c=6$)\n$\\delta(11) = 8$ (nets $n_1, n_2, n_3, n_4, n_5, n_6, n_7, n_8$)\n$\\delta(12) = 8$ (same as at $c=11$; $n_3$ and $n_8$ end here)\n$\\delta(13) = 6$ (nets $n_1, n_2, n_4, n_5, n_6, n_7$)\n$\\delta(14) = 6$ (same as at $c=13$; $n_5$ ends here)\n$\\delta(15) = 5$ (nets $n_1, n_2, n_4, n_6, n_7$; $n_1$ and $n_6$ end here)\n$\\delta(16) = 3$ (nets $n_2, n_4, n_7$; $n_2$ and $n_4$ end here)\n$\\delta(17) = 1$ (net $n_7$; $n_7$ ends here)\n\nThe local densities $\\delta(c)$ are $\\{1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 6, 6, 5, 3, 1\\}$.\nThe channel density $D$ is the maximum of these values.\n$$D = \\max\\{1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 8, 6, 6, 5, 3, 1\\} = 8$$\nThe maximum density occurs at columns $c=11$ and $c=12$.\nThe channel density $D$ is therefore $8$. This value represents the theoretical lower bound on the number of horizontal tracks required to route this channel instance without vertical constraints.",

            "problem": "In a two-layer Manhattan channel routing model used in Electronic Design Automation (EDA), consider the constrained left-edge setting without doglegs, meaning each net must occupy exactly one horizontal track across the span between its leftmost and rightmost pin columns. Let there be $W=8$ columns, indexed by integers $1$ through $8$, and three multi-terminal nets $A$, $B$, and $C$ with the following top-row and bottom-row pin placements (no other pins exist):\n\n- Top-row pins: column $1$ carries $A$, column $2$ carries $B$, column $3$ carries $A$, and column $7$ carries $C$.\n- Bottom-row pins: column $3$ carries $B$, column $6$ carries $C$, column $7$ carries $A$, and column $8$ carries $A$.\n\nUse the following fundamental definitions to analyze this instance:\n\n- The span of a net $n$, denoted $[\\ell(n), r(n)]$, is the interval from its leftmost to its rightmost pin column.\n- The channel density $D$ is the maximum, over all vertical cuts $x$ strictly between integer columns, of the number of distinct net spans that strictly cover $x$.\n- A vertical constraint arises at column $j$ whenever a top-row pin of net $X$ and a bottom-row pin of net $Y$ appear in the same column $j$, requiring $X$ to be placed on a track strictly above $Y$ at that column.

            "solution": "The problem is a well-defined instance of constrained channel routing in Electronic Design Automation (EDA). The validation process confirms that the problem is self-contained, scientifically grounded in the principles of VLSI design, and uses standard, objective definitions. All necessary data is provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe solution is derived in three steps as requested by the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we determine the span of each net and the channel density. The span of a net $n$, denoted as $[\\ell(n), r(n)]$, is the closed interval defined by its leftmost and rightmost pin column indices.\n\nThe pin locations for the three nets $A$, $B$, and $C$ are given as:\n- Net $A$: pins at columns $1$, $3$, $7$, and $8$. The leftmost pin is at column $1$ and the rightmost is at column $8$. Thus, the span of net $A$ is $[\\ell(A), r(A)] = [1, 8]$.\n- Net $B$: pins at columns $2$ and $3$. The leftmost pin is at column $2$ and the rightmost is at column $3$. Thus, the span of net $B$ is $[\\ell(B), r(B)] = [2, 3]$.\n- Net $C$: pins at columns $6$ and $7$. The leftmost pin is at column $6$ and the rightmost is at column $7$. Thus, the span of net $C$ is $[\\ell(C), r(C)] = [6, 7]$.\n\nNext, we compute the channel density $D$. The channel density is the maximum number of net spans that strictly cover any vertical cut $x$ between adjacent integer columns. A span $[\\ell(n), r(n)]$ strictly covers $x$ if $\\ell(n)  x  r(n)$. The vertical cuts are at locations $x \\in \\{1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 7.5\\}$. We calculate the local density at each cut:\n- Cut at $x=1.5$: Only net $A$ has a span $[1, 8]$ that satisfies $1  1.5  8$. The local density is $1$.\n- Cut at $x=2.5$: Net $A$ ($1  2.5  8$) and net $B$ ($2  2.5  3$) cover this cut. The local density is $2$.\n- Cut at $x=3.5$: Only net $A$ ($1  3.5  8$) covers this cut. The span for net $B$ is $[2, 3]$, and $r(B)=3$ is not greater than $3.5$. The local density is $1$.\n- Cut at $x=4.5$: Only net $A$ ($1  4.5  8$) covers this cut. The local density is $1$.\n- Cut at $x=5.5$: Only net $A$ ($1  5.5  8$) covers this cut. The local density is $1$.\n- Cut at $x=6.5$: Net $A$ ($1  6.5  8$) and net $C$ ($6  6.5  7$) cover this cut. The local density is $2$.\n- Cut at $x=7.5$: Only net $A$ ($1  7.5  8$) covers this cut. The span for net $C$ is $[6, 7]$, and $r(C)=7$ is not greater than $7.5$. The local density is $1$.\n\nThe maximum of these local densities is $2$. Therefore, the channel density is $D=2$.\n\nSecond, we determine the minimum number of tracks $H$ required for a legal routing. This number is determined by two lower bounds: the channel density $D$ and the length of the longest path $L$ in the vertical constraint graph (VCG). The minimum number of tracks is $H = \\max(D, L)$.\n\nA vertical constraint from net $X$ to net $Y$ (denoted $X \\rightarrow Y$) exists if there is a column $j$ where net $X$ has a top-row pin and net $Y$ has a bottom-row pin. This requires net $X$ to be placed on a track physically above the track for net $Y$.\n- At column $j=3$: Net $A$ has a top-row pin and net $B$ has a bottom-row pin. This establishes the constraint that $A$ must be above $B$, which we represent as a directed edge $A \\rightarrow B$ in the VCG.\n- At column $j=7$: Net $C$ has a top-row pin and net $A$ has a bottom-row pin. This establishes the constraint that $C$ must be above $A$, represented by the edge $C \\rightarrow A$.\n\nNo other columns impose vertical constraints. The VCG consists of nodes $\\{A, B, C\\}$ and directed edges $\\{(A, B), (C, A)\\}$. These constraints must be transitively satisfied. The edges form a chain: $C \\rightarrow A \\rightarrow B$. This represents the requirement that net $C$ must be above net $A$, which in turn must be above net $B$.\n\nThe longest path in the VCG is $C \\rightarrow A \\rightarrow B$. The length of this path, defined as the number of distinct nets (nodes) it contains, is $L=3$. This implies that at least $3$ distinct tracks are necessary to satisfy the vertical ordering requirements.\n\nThe minimum number of tracks $H$ must be sufficient to satisfy both the horizontal (density) and vertical (constraint graph) requirements. Thus, $H$ is the maximum of the two lower bounds:\n$$H = \\max(D, L) = \\max(2, 3) = 3$$\nThe optimality of $H=3$ is justified because $D$ and $L$ represent fundamental lower bounds on track usage. Since the VCG is acyclic, a routing that achieves this bound is always possible. Therefore, the minimum number of tracks required is $H=3$.\n\nThird, we compute the multiplicative ratio $G = H/D$. Using the values derived above, we have $H = 3$ and $D = 2$. The ratio is:\n$$G = \\frac{H}{D} = \\frac{3}{2}$$\nThis value quantifies the gap between the density-based lower bound and the true minimum number of tracks, which in this case is dictated by the length of a vertical constraint chain.",

            "problem": "Consider a two-layer channel routing problem in the context of Electronic Design Automation (EDA), where horizontal wires are assigned to discrete tracks between two rows of fixed terminals (one row on top of the channel and one row on bottom). A net is specified by its terminals; each net must realize vertical connections (vias) from its terminals to a single horizontal segment placed on some track. The horizontal segment of a net spans from its leftmost terminal column to its rightmost terminal column, defining an interval. Two horizontal segments cannot occupy the same track if their intervals overlap in any column. A vertical constraint arises when, in a given column, there is a top terminal for net $i$ and a bottom terminal for net $j$; in that case, the horizontal segment of net $i$ must be assigned to a physically higher track than that of net $j$. Assume track indices increase downward, so “higher track” means a smaller track index.\n\nThe left-edge algorithm (and its constrained variant) is a greedy track assignment procedure that, on each pass, selects nets available to be placed (respecting vertical constraints), orders them by left edge, and assigns them to the lowest track where they can be placed without overlapping already assigned intervals in that track. The algorithm repeats until all nets are assigned.\n\nConstructed instance: The channel has columns $1$ through $10$. The top-row terminals are at columns $1$, $2$, $3$, $4$, $5$, $6$, $7$, $8$, and $9$, respectively for nets $N_1$, $N_2$, $N_3$, $N_4$, $N_5$, $N_4$, $N_3$, $N_2$, and $N_1$.

Identification of Net Intervals\nThe horizontal interval for each net $N_k$, denoted $I(N_k)$, spans from its minimum column coordinate to its maximum column coordinate.\n\n- **Net $N_1$**: Has terminals at columns $1, 9$ (top) and $10$ (bottom). The leftmost is $1$ and the rightmost is $10$. So, $I(N_1) = [1, 10]$.\n- **Net $N_2$**: Has terminals at columns $2, 8$ (top) and $9$ (bottom). The leftmost is $2$ and the rightmost is $9$. So, $I(N_2) = [2, 9]$.\n- **Net $N_3$**: Has terminals at columns $3, 7$ (top) and $8$ (bottom). The leftmost is $3$ and the rightmost is $8$. So, $I(N_3) = [3, 8]$.\n- **Net $N_4$**: Has terminals at columns $4, 6$ (top) and $7$ (bottom). The leftmost is $4$ and the rightmost is $7$. So, $I(N_4) = [4, 7]$.\n- **Net $N_5$**: Has terminals at column $5$ (top) and $6$ (bottom). The leftmost is $5$ and the rightmost is $6$. So, $I(N_5) = [5, 6]$.\n\n#### 2. Derivation of Vertical Constraints\nA vertical constraint $N_i \\to N_j$ exists if there is a column where $N_i$ has a top terminal and $N_j$ has a bottom terminal. This implies that the track index for $N_i$ must be smaller than that for $N_j$, i.e., $T(N_i)  T(N_j)$. We examine columns with both top and bottom terminals.\n\n- **Column 6**: Top terminal for $N_4$, bottom terminal for $N_5$. This imposes the constraint $T(N_4)  T(N_5)$.\n- **Column 7**: Top terminal for $N_3$, bottom terminal for $N_4$. This imposes the constraint $T(N_3)  T(N_4)$.\n- **Column 8**: Top terminal for $N_2$, bottom terminal for $N_3$. This imposes the constraint $T(N_2)  T(N_3)$.\n- **Column 9**: Top terminal for $N_1$, bottom terminal for $N_2$. This imposes the constraint $T(N_1)  T(N_2)$.\n\nThe vertical constraint graph (VCG) consists of the directed edges $N_1 \\to N_2$, $N_2 \\to N_3$, $N_3 \\to N_4$, and $N_4 \\to N_5$. These constraints form a single chain:\n$$N_1 \\to N_2 \\to N_3 \\to N_4 \\to N_5$$\nThis implies a total ordering on the track assignments:\n$$T(N_1)  T(N_2)  T(N_3)  T(N_4)  T(N_5)$$\n\n#### 3. Application of the Constrained Left-Edge Algorithm\n\nThe algorithm proceeds in passes. In each pass, it considers all \"available\" nets, which are unassigned nets whose predecessors in the VCG have all been assigned.\n\n**Horizontal Overlap Analysis**:\nThe intervals are $I(N_1) = [1, 10]$, $I(N_2) = [2, 9]$, $I(N_3) = [3, 8]$, $I(N_4) = [4, 7]$, and $I(N_5) = [5, 6]$.\nNotice that these intervals are nested:\n$$I(N_5) \\subset I(N_4) \\subset I(N_3) \\subset I(N_2) \\subset I(N_1)$$\nBecause every interval is a subset of the next larger one, any two distinct intervals $I(N_i)$ and $I(N_j)$ have a non-empty intersection. For example, $I(N_1) \\cap I(N_2) = [2, 9] \\neq \\emptyset$. Therefore, no two nets from this set can be placed on the same track. This set of 5 nets forms a 5-clique in the horizontal constraint graph, which establishes a lower bound of $5$ tracks for the channel width.\n\n**Algorithm Execution**:\n\n- **Pass 1**:\n    - **Available Nets**: Initially, only net $N_1$ is available as it has no predecessors in the VCG.\n    - **Assignment**: The algorithm places $N_1$ on the first available track.\n        - Track $1$: Empty. Assign $N_1$ (interval $[1, 10]$) to Track $1$.\n    - **Status**: Placed: $\\{N_1\\}$. Tracks used: $1$.\n\n- **Pass 2**:\n    - **Available Nets**: Now that $N_1$ is placed, its successor $N_2$ becomes available.\n    - **Assignment**: The algorithm attempts to place $N_2$ (interval $[2, 9]$).\n        - Track $1$: Occupied by $N_1$ ($[1, 10]$). The intervals $[2, 9]$ and $[1, 10]$ overlap. Cannot place here.\n        - Track $2$: Empty. Assign $N_2$ to Track $2$.\n    - **Status**: Placed: $\\{N_1, N_2\\}$. Tracks used: $2$.\n\n- **Pass 3**:\n    - **Available Nets**: With $N_2$ placed, its successor $N_3$ becomes available.\n    - **Assignment**: The algorithm attempts to place $N_3$ (interval $[3, 8]$).\n        - Track $1$: Occupied by $N_1$ ($[1, 10]$). Overlap.\n        - Track $2$: Occupied by $N_2$ ($[2, 9]$). Overlap.\n        - Track $3$: Empty. Assign $N_3$ to Track $3$.\n    - **Status**: Placed: $\\{N_1, N_2, N_3\\}$. Tracks used: $3$.\n\n- **Pass 4**:\n    - **Available Nets**: With $N_3$ placed, its successor $N_4$ becomes available.\n    - **Assignment**: The algorithm attempts to place $N_4$ (interval $[4, 7]$).\n        - Track $1$: Occupied by $N_1$ ($[1, 10]$). Overlap.\n        - Track $2$: Occupied by $N_2$ ($[2, 9]$). Overlap.\n        - Track $3$: Occupied by $N_3$ ($[3, 8]$). Overlap.\n        - Track $4$: Empty. Assign $N_4$ to Track $4$.\n    - **Status**: Placed: $\\{N_1, N_2, N_3, N_4\\}$. Tracks used: $4$.\n\n- **Pass 5**:\n    - **Available Nets**: With $N_4$ placed, its successor $N_5$ becomes available.\n    - **Assignment**: The algorithm attempts to place $N_5$ (interval $[5, 6]$).\n        - Track $1$: Occupied by $N_1$ ($[1, 10]$). Overlap.\n        - Track $2$: Occupied by $N_2$ ($[2, 9]$). Overlap.\n        - Track $3$: Occupied by $N_3$ ($[3, 8]$). Overlap.\n        - Track $4$: Occupied by $N_4$ ($[4, 7]$). Overlap.\n        - Track $5$: Empty. Assign $N_5$ to Track $5$.\n    - **Status**: Placed: $\\{N_1, N_2, N_3, N_4, N_5\\}$. Tracks used: $5$.\n\nAll nets have been assigned. The final assignment is:\n- Track $1$: $N_1$\n- Track $2$: $N_2$\n- Track $3$: $N_3$\n- Track $4$: $N_4$\n- Track $5$: $N_5$\n\nThis assignment respects the total vertical constraint ordering $T(N_1)=1  T(N_2)=2  T(N_3)=3  T(N_4)=4  T(N_5)=5$. The total number of tracks used is $5$.\n\nThis specific instance is a classic example in channel routing known as \"Deutsch's Difficult Example\", designed to demonstrate a worst-case scenario where the left-edge algorithm is forced to use a number of tracks equal to the longest path in the VCG plus the maximum density, minus one. Here, the longest path in the VCG is $5$ and the maximum density (maximum number of nets crossing any column) is also $5$ (at column $6$). The algorithm requires $5$ tracks, which is the sum of the longest path in the VCG and the clique size of the interval graph, minus one, but more simply, it matches the size of the clique and the length of the VCG path.\n\n#### 4. Total Number of Tracks\nAs determined by the execution of the constrained left-edge algorithm, a total of $5$ tracks are required to route all the nets according to the specified constraints.",
