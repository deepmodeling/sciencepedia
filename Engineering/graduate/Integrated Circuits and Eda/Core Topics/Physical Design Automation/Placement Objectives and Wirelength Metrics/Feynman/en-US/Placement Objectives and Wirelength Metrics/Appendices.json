            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation and comparison of three standard wirelength metrics for a single net with three pins. The pin coordinates are given as $p_1=(2,1)$, $p_2=(2,5)$, and $p_3=(9,3)$ in micrometers. The routing is rectilinear, meaning all interconnects are composed of horizontal and vertical segments. The distance metric is the Manhattan distance, defined for two points $p_i=(x_i, y_i)$ and $p_j=(x_j, y_j)$ as $d(p_i, p_j) = |x_i - x_j| + |y_i - y_j|$.\n\n**1. Half-Perimeter Wirelength (HPWL)**\n\nThe Half-Perimeter Wirelength (HPWL) is a widely used estimate of wirelength, calculated as the half-perimeter of the smallest axis-aligned bounding box enclosing all pins of the net.\n\nFirst, we identify the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates from the set of pins $P = \\{p_1, p_2, p_3\\}$.\nThe x-coordinates of the pins are $\\{2, 2, 9\\}$.\nThe y-coordinates of the pins are $\\{1, 5, 3\\}$.\n\nThe extremal coordinates are:\n$x_{\\min} = \\min(2, 2, 9) = 2$\n$x_{\\max} = \\max(2, 2, 9) = 9$\n$y_{\\min} = \\min(1, 5, 3) = 1$\n$y_{\\max} = \\max(1, 5, 3) = 5$\n\nThe width of the bounding box is the span of the x-coordinates, $W = x_{\\max} - x_{\\min} = 9 - 2 = 7 \\, \\mu m$.\nThe height of the bounding box is the span of the y-coordinates, $H = y_{\\max} - y_{\\min} = 5 - 1 = 4 \\, \\mu m$.\n\nThe HPWL is the sum of the width and height:\n$$\\text{HPWL} = W + H = (x_{\\max} - x_{\\min}) + (y_{\\max} - y_{\\min})$$\n$$\\text{HPWL} = 7 + 4 = 11 \\, \\mu m$$\n\n**2. Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Length**\n\nThe Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) connects all pins with the minimum possible total wirelength, using only edges between the pins themselves and without adding any new intermediate points. The problem is equivalent to finding the MST of a complete graph with the pins as vertices and the Manhattan distances as edge weights.\n\nWe calculate the Manhattan distance between each pair of pins:\n-   Distance between $p_1=(2,1)$ and $p_2=(2,5)$:\n    $d(p_1, p_2) = |2-2| + |1-5| = 0 + 4 = 4$\n-   Distance between $p_1=(2,1)$ and $p_3=(9,3)$:\n    $d(p_1, p_3) = |2-9| + |1-3| = 7 + 2 = 9$\n-   Distance between $p_2=(2,5)$ and $p_3=(9,3)$:\n    $d(p_2, p_3) = |2-9| + |5-3| = 7 + 2 = 9$\n\nThe set of edge weights is $\\{4, 9, 9\\}$. To form an MST on $3$ vertices, we must select the $3-1=2$ edges with the smallest weights that do not form a cycle. Applying Kruskal's algorithm:\n1.  Select the edge with the minimum weight, which is $(p_1, p_2)$ with length $4$.\n2.  Select the edge with the next-smallest weight. There is a tie between $(p_1, p_3)$ and $(p_2, p_3)$, both of length $9$. Selecting either one connects the final pin $p_3$ to the existing network. For instance, selecting $(p_1, p_3)$ results in the tree edges $(p_1, p_2)$ and $(p_1, p_3)$.\n\nThe total length of the MST is the sum of the weights of the chosen edges:\n$$\\text{MST} = d(p_1, p_2) + d(p_1, p_3) = 4 + 9 = 13 \\, \\mu m$$\n\n**3. Rectilinear Steiner Minimal Tree (RSMT) Length**\n\nThe Rectilinear Steiner Minimal Tree (RSMT) is the shortest possible rectilinear network connecting all pins. It may introduce new junction points, called Steiner points, to reduce the total length. For a set of pins, the optimal Steiner points for an RSMT lie on the Hanan grid, which is formed by passing horizontal and vertical lines through each pin.\n\nFor a net with $n=3$ pins, the RSMT has at most one optimal Steiner point $s = (x_s, y_s)$, whose coordinates are the medians of the pin coordinates.\nThe set of x-coordinates is $\\{2, 2, 9\\}$. The median is $x_s = 2$.\nThe set of y-coordinates is $\\{1, 3, 5\\}$ (when sorted). The median is $y_s = 3$.\nThe optimal Steiner point is therefore $s=(2,3)$.\n\nThe geometry of the resulting Steiner tree is formed by connecting the three pins to this Steiner point. The union of the rectilinear paths from $s$ to each pin forms the tree.\n-   The path from $p_1=(2,1)$ to $s=(2,3)$ and the path from $p_2=(2,5)$ to $s=(2,3)$ combine to form a single vertical trunk on the line $x=2$ that spans from $y=1$ to $y=5$. The length of this trunk is $|5-1|=4$.\n-   The path from $p_3=(9,3)$ to $s=(2,3)$ is a horizontal branch on the line $y=3$ that spans from $x=2$ to $x=9$. The length of this branch is $|9-2|=7$.\nThe total length of the RSMT is the sum of the lengths of these two orthogonal segments:\n$$\\text{RSMT} = 4 + 7 = 11 \\, \\mu m$$\n\nIt is a known theorem that for nets with $n \\le 3$ pins, the HPWL is an exact calculation for the RSMT length. Our results, $\\text{HPWL}=11$ and $\\text{RSMT}=11$, are consistent with this theorem.\n\n**4. Summary and Quantitative Comparison**\n\nThe computed wirelengths are:\n-   $\\text{HPWL} = 11 \\, \\mu m$\n-   $\\text{MST} = 13 \\, \\mu m$\n-   $\\text{RSMT} = 11 \\, \\mu m$\n\nThe ordered triple $(\\text{HPWL}, \\text{MST}, \\text{RSMT})$ is $(11, 13, 11)$.\n\nA key relationship in wirelength estimation is $\\text{RSMT} \\le \\text{MST}$. The RSMT represents the true minimum wirelength, while the MST provides a computationally simple upper bound. In our case, $\\text{RSMT} = 11 \\, \\mu m$ and $\\text{MST} = 13 \\, \\mu m$. The introduction of a Steiner point yields a length reduction of $2 \\, \\mu m$, which is a $15.4\\%$ improvement over the MST length $(\\frac{13-11}{13} \\approx 0.154)$. The ratio $\\frac{\\text{MST}}{\\text{RSMT}} = \\frac{13}{11} \\approx 1.1818$, which is well within the theoretical maximum for the rectilinear Steiner ratio of $\\frac{3}{2}=1.5$. The HPWL metric, which is computationally the simplest, provides an exact value for the RSMT in the case of $n=3$ pins.",
