            "solution": "The problem asks for the minimum precharge duration, $t_p$, required for the voltage of a dynamic node, $V_N$, to rise from $0$ to at least $V_{DD} - \\Delta V$. The charging circuit is modeled as a series resistor-capacitor (RC) circuit, where the precharge transistor is represented by a resistor $R_p$, the dynamic node has a capacitance $C_N$, and the supply voltage is $V_{DD}$.\n\nWe begin by modeling the circuit using first principles. According to Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL), the sum of voltages around the closed loop containing the supply, the resistor, and the capacitor must be zero. Let $t=0$ be the start of the precharge phase. The KVL equation is:\n$$V_{DD} = V_R(t) + V_N(t)$$\nwhere $V_R(t)$ is the voltage across the resistor $R_p$ and $V_N(t)$ is the voltage across the capacitor $C_N$ at time $t$.\n\nThe current $I(t)$ flowing through the resistor is given by Ohm's Law:\n$$I(t) = \\frac{V_R(t)}{R_p}$$\nSubstituting $V_R(t) = V_{DD} - V_N(t)$ from the KVL equation, we get:\n$$I(t) = \\frac{V_{DD} - V_N(t)}{R_p}$$\nThis same current is responsible for charging the capacitor. The relationship between current and the rate of change of capacitor voltage is:\n$$I(t) = C_N \\frac{dV_N(t)}{dt}$$\nEquating the two expressions for the current $I(t)$ yields the first-order linear ordinary differential equation that governs the behavior of the node voltage $V_N(t)$:\n$$C_N \\frac{dV_N}{dt} = \\frac{V_{DD} - V_N}{R_p}$$\nTo solve this differential equation, we can rearrange it for the method of separation of variables:\n$$\\frac{dV_N}{V_{DD} - V_N} = \\frac{dt}{R_p C_N}$$\nWe integrate both sides. Let the integration run from the initial state at time $t=0$ to an arbitrary state at time $t$:\n$$\\int_{V_N(0)}^{V_N(t)} \\frac{dV'_N}{V_{DD} - V'_N} = \\int_0^t \\frac{dt'}{R_p C_N}$$\nThe problem states a worst-case initial condition, $V_N(0) = 0$.

            "problem": "A domino dynamic logic gate is implemented in a modern complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) process and is analyzed within the context of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) clocking strategies. The dynamic precharge node, with total capacitance dominated by parasitics, is held high at the end of the precharge phase. At the beginning of the evaluation phase, the clock voltage waveform $V_{clk}(t)$ transitions monotonically from $0$ to $V_{DD}$ with finite slew rate $\\frac{dV_{clk}}{dt}$. Due to the gate–drain capacitance of the evaluation network’s first Metal–Oxide–Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET), the clock couples to the dynamic node through an effective coupling capacitance $C_{gc}$, producing a displacement current that tends to discharge the dynamic node when $V_{clk}(t)$ rises. A keeper p-channel MOSFET sources a nearly constant current $I_{k}$ during this transition. For robust node stability, the residual net discharge current at the dynamic node that is not balanced by the keeper must not exceed a specified bound $I_{max}$, which is derived from the allowable voltage droop budget and the clock edge duration in the system timing analysis.\n\nUsing only Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL) and the capacitor current relation $i = C \\frac{dV}{dt}$ as fundamental bases, derive an expression for the maximum allowable positive clock slew $\\frac{dV_{clk}}{dt}$ that guarantees the net discharge current at the dynamic node does not exceed $I_{max}$.

The final answer must be a single expression only, with no inequalities or additional commentary.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of an expression for the maximum allowable positive clock slew rate, denoted as $\\frac{dV_{clk}}{dt}$, for a domino dynamic logic gate. The derivation must adhere to the constraint that the net discharge current at the dynamic node does not exceed a specified maximum value, $I_{max}$. The derivation will be based solely on Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL) and the fundamental capacitor current relationship.\n\nLet us analyze the currents at the dynamic precharge node during the evaluation phase, specifically during the rising edge of the clock signal $V_{clk}(t)$. According to KCL, the algebraic sum of currents entering and leaving a node must be zero. We define currents leaving the node as positive and currents entering the node as negative.\n\nThere are two primary currents affecting the charge on the dynamic node as described in the problem statement:\n$1$. The current sourced by the keeper p-channel MOSFET, which we denote as $I_k$. This current flows into the dynamic node to counteract leakage and noise effects. Therefore, in our sign convention, it is represented as $-I_k$.\n$2$. The displacement current through the gate–drain coupling capacitance, $C_{gc}$, caused by the rising clock voltage. This current acts to discharge the dynamic node. The current through a capacitor is given by the relation $i = C \\frac{dV}{dt}$, where $V$ is the voltage across the capacitor. The voltage across $C_{gc}$ is the difference between the dynamic node voltage, $V_{dyn}$, and the clock voltage, $V_{clk}$. The current flowing *from* the dynamic node *to* the clock line through this capacitor is $I_{coup} = C_{gc} \\frac{d(V_{dyn} - V_{clk})}{dt}$. The problem states that this coupling produces a current that \"tends to discharge the dynamic node when $V_{clk}(t)$ rises\". This discharge component is driven by the change in the clock voltage. In the context of this simplified analysis, which is standard for assessing clock feedthrough, the discharge current component of interest is $I_{discharge} = C_{gc} \\frac{dV_{clk}}{dt}$. This term represents a current flowing out of the dynamic node, hence it is positive in our sign convention. This is because a positive $\\frac{dV_{clk}}{dt}$ induces a current that removes charge from the dynamic node.\n\nThe problem defines a \"residual net discharge current at the dynamic node that is not balanced by the keeper\". This is the net current flowing out of the node, which is the sum of the discharge current due to clock coupling and the keeper current. Let us call this $I_{net\\_discharge}$.\n\nApplying KCL to the dynamic node:\n$$I_{net\\_discharge} = I_{discharge} + (-I_k)$$\nSubstituting the expression for the discharge current:\n$$I_{net\\_discharge} = C_{gc} \\frac{dV_{clk}}{dt} - I_k$$\n\nThe problem imposes a robustness constraint: the net discharge current must not exceed a specified bound $I_{max}$. This can be written as an inequality:\n$$I_{net\\_discharge} \\le I_{max}$$\n\nSubstituting our expression for $I_{net\\_discharge}$ into the inequality gives:\n$$C_{gc} \\frac{dV_{clk}}{dt} - I_k \\le I_{max}$$\n\nTo find the maximum allowable clock slew rate, we must solve this inequality for $\\frac{dV_{clk}}{dt}$. We can rearrange the terms by adding $I_k$ to both sides:\n$$C_{gc} \\frac{dV_{clk}}{dt} \\le I_{max} + I_k$$\n\nSince the capacitance $C_{gc}$ is a physical parameter, its value is strictly positive ($C_{gc} > 0$). Therefore, we can divide both sides of the inequality by $C_{gc}$ without changing the direction of the inequality sign:\n$$\\frac{dV_{clk}}{dt} \\le \\frac{I_{max} + I_k}{C_{gc}}$$\n\nThis inequality provides the upper bound for the clock slew rate. The maximum allowable positive clock slew rate is the value at which the equality holds. Let's denote this maximum rate as $(\\frac{dV_{clk}}{dt})_{max}$.\n$$ \\left(\\frac{dV_{clk}}{dt}\\right)_{max} = \\frac{I_{max} + I_k}{C_{gc}} $$\nThis expression represents the highest clock slew rate the circuit can tolerate without violating the specified voltage droop budget, which is encapsulated in the parameter $I_{max}$. The result is expressed solely in terms of the given parameters $I_{max}$, $I_k$, and $C_{gc}$. A check of the physical units confirms the validity of the expression: Current (Amperes) divided by Capacitance (Farads) yields $\\frac{C/s}{C/V} = V/s$, which are the correct units for a slew rate.",

A false evaluation occurs if the dynamic node voltage, $V_{D}(t)$, drops below the switching threshold $V_{M}$ of the subsequent static inverter.\n\nThe core of the problem is a race condition between the evaluation clock $\\phi_{eval}$ turning on the pull-down path and the late input $X$ turning it off. A discharge path to ground through the pull-down network exists only when both the footer transistor (controlled by $\\phi_{eval}$) and the input transistors (controlled by $X$ and $Y$) are conducting. Since input $Y$ is held high at $V_{DD}$, its corresponding NMOS transistor is always on for evaluation.

Determine the time interval during which the pull-down path is active.\n2.  Model the discharge of the dynamic node capacitance $C_{D}$ during this interval.\n3.  Apply the constraint that the node voltage must not fall below $V_{M}$ to find the maximum allowed discharge duration.\n4.

The time at which this occurs, $t_{X,off}$, is found by setting $X(t_{X,off}) = V_{Tx}$:\n$$ V_{Tx} = V_{DD} - \\frac{V_{DD}}{T_f}(t_{X,off} - t_a) $$\n$$ \\frac{V_{DD}}{T_f}(t_{X,off} - t_a) = V_{DD} - V_{Tx} $$\n$$ t_{X,off} - t_a = \\frac{T_f}{V_{DD}}(V_{DD} - V_{Tx}) = T_f \\left(1 - \\frac{V_{Tx}}{V_{DD}}\\right) $$\n$$ t_{X,off} = t_a + T_f \\left(1 - \\frac{V_{Tx}}{V_{DD}}\\right) $$\nThe transistor for input $X$ is conducting for $t < t_{X,off}$.\n\nA conducting path to ground, with resistance $R_{pd}$, exists only when both transistors are on. This condition defines the discharge interval. The discharge begins when the later of the two transistors turns on and ends when the earlier of the two turns off. Since input $X$ is initially high and the clock $\\phi_{eval}$ is initially low, the path is enabled when the footer turns on and disabled when the input $X$ turns off.
