            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated and found to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the fundamental principles of synchronous digital circuit timing, is well-posed with a unique and meaningful solution, and is expressed in objective, unambiguous language. All necessary parameters are provided, and the stated assumptions (zero clock skew and jitter) create a self-contained, solvable problem.\n\nWe begin by establishing a timing reference. Let us consider the operation of the circuit over one clock cycle. Let the clock period be denoted by $T$. We can set the time of an active clock edge at the launching register to be $t=0$.\n\nThe data stored in the launching register is launched onto the combinational path after the clock-to-output delay of the register. Therefore, the time at which the new data signal begins to propagate from the output of the launching register, which we define as the launch time, is:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{launch}} = 0 + t_{cq} = t_{cq}$$\n\nThis signal then propagates through the combinational logic block. To ensure correct operation under all conditions, we must consider the worst-case scenario, which corresponds to the longest possible delay through this logic. The maximum propagation delay is given as $D_{\\max}$. The data signal will therefore arrive at the input of the capturing register no later than the sum of the launch time and this maximum logic delay. We define this as the arrival time, $t_{\\mathrm{arrival}}$:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{arrival}} = t_{\\mathrm{launch}} + D_{\\max} = t_{cq} + D_{\\max}$$\n\nFor the capturing register to correctly sample this arriving data, the data signal must be stable at its input for a certain duration *before* the next active clock edge arrives. This duration is the setup time, $t_{\\mathrm{setup}}$. The next active clock edge at the capturing register occurs at time $t=T$ (since clock skew is assumed to be zero). Therefore, the data must be stable and valid at the input of the capturing register by a time $t_{\\mathrm{setup}}$ prior to $T$. This defines the required time, $t_{\\mathrm{required}}$:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{required}} = T - t_{\\mathrm{setup}}$$\n\nThe fundamental constraint for avoiding a setup time violation is that the data must arrive at the capturing register on or before the time it is required. This can be expressed as the following inequality:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{arrival}} \\le t_{\\mathrm{required}}$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $t_{\\mathrm{arrival}}$ and $t_{\\mathrm{required}}$ into this inequality yields the setup time constraint for the path:\n$$t_{cq} + D_{\\max} \\le T - t_{\\mathrm{setup}}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum feasible clock period, which we denote as $T_{\\min}$. This minimum period is found by rearranging the inequality to solve for $T$:\n$$T \\ge t_{cq} + D_{\\max} + t_{\\mathrm{setup}}$$\nThe minimum value of $T$ that satisfies this condition is the lower bound of the inequality. Thus,\n$$T_{\\min} = t_{cq} + D_{\\max} + t_{\\mathrm{setup}}$$\n\nWe are given the following numerical values for the timing parameters:\n- Clock-to-output time, $t_{cq} = 80\\ \\mathrm{ps}$\n- Maximum combinational delay, $D_{\\max} = 420\\ \\mathrm{ps}$\n- Setup time, $t_{\\mathrm{setup}} = 60\\ \\mathrm{ps}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $T_{\\min}$:\n$$T_{\\min} = 80\\ \\mathrm{ps} + 420\\ \\mathrm{ps} + 60\\ \\mathrm{ps}$$\n$$T_{\\min} = 500\\ \\mathrm{ps} + 60\\ \\mathrm{ps}$$\n$$T_{\\min} = 560\\ \\mathrm{ps}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $560$ can be written as $560.0$ to explicitly represent four significant figures.\n\nTherefore, the minimum feasible clock period that guarantees no setup-time violation is $560.0\\ \\mathrm{ps}$.",

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis of hold time violation focuses on the earliest possible arrival of new data at the capturing flip-flop's input and ensures it does not occur before the hold time window for the previous data has passed. Let's establish a time reference. We can set the time of the clock edge at the launching flip-flop to $t_{\\text{clk,launch}} = 0$.\n\n**1. Derivation of Symbolic Expression for Hold Slack**\n\nFirst, we determine the earliest possible time that data launched from the source flip-flop arrives at the input of the destination flip-flop. This is known as the **earliest data arrival time**, let's denote it as $t_{\\text{DA,early}}$. This time is determined by the fastest path from the clock pin of the launch flip-flop to the data input pin of the capture flip-flop.\nThe data is launched by the clock edge at $t_{\\text{clk,launch}}$. The earliest it appears at the output of the launch flip-flop is after the minimum clock-to-output delay, $t_{cq,\\min}$. It then travels through the combinational logic, taking at least the minimum path delay, $D_{\\min}$.\nTherefore, the earliest data arrival time at the D-input of the capturing flip-flop is:\n$$t_{\\text{DA,early}} = t_{\\text{clk,launch}} + t_{cq,\\min} + D_{\\min}$$\n\nNext, we determine the time until which the input data at the capturing flip-flop must remain stable to satisfy its hold requirement. This is the **latest data required time for hold**, which we can denote as $t_{\\text{DR,hold}}$. The hold constraint, $t_{hold}$, is specified relative to the clock edge at the capturing flip-flop. The clock edge arrives at the capturing flip-flop at time $t_{\\text{clk,capture}}$. The data must remain stable for a duration of $t_{hold}$ *after* this edge.\nThus, the time window for the hold requirement ends at:\n$$t_{\\text{DR,hold}} = t_{\\text{clk,capture}} + t_{hold}$$\n\nHold slack, often denoted as $S_{hold}$, is defined as the margin by which the hold timing requirement is met. It is the difference between the earliest arrival time of the new data and the latest time the old data is required to be stable. A positive slack indicates that the new data arrives after the hold window, thus satisfying the constraint. A negative slack indicates a hold violation.\n\n$$S_{hold} = t_{\\text{DA,early}} - t_{\\text{DR,hold}}$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $t_{\\text{DA,early}}$ and $t_{\\text{DR,hold}}$:\n$$S_{hold} = (t_{\\text{clk,launch}} + t_{cq,\\min} + D_{\\min}) - (t_{\\text{clk,capture}} + t_{hold})$$\n\nThe problem defines the clock skew as $s = t_{\\text{clk,capture}} - t_{\\text{clk,launch}}$. We can rearrange the terms in the slack equation to use this definition:\n$$S_{hold} = t_{cq,\\min} + D_{\\min} - t_{hold} - (t_{\\text{clk,capture}} - t_{\\text{clk,launch}})$$\nSubstituting $s$ into the equation gives the final symbolic expression for hold slack:\n$$S_{hold} = t_{cq,\\min} + D_{\\min} - t_{hold} - s$$\n\nThis is the derived symbolic expression for hold slack in terms of the given variables.\n\n**2. Numerical Calculation of Hold Slack**\n\nWe are given the following numerical values:\n- $t_{cq,\\min} = 60\\ \\mathrm{ps}$\n- $D_{\\min} = 90\\ \\mathrm{ps}$\n- $t_{hold} = 50\\ \\mathrm{ps}$\n- $s = 0\\ \\mathrm{ps}$ (zero skew)\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $S_{hold}$:\n$$S_{hold} = 60\\ \\mathrm{ps} + 90\\ \\mathrm{ps} - 50\\ \\mathrm{ps} - 0\\ \\mathrm{ps}$$\n$$S_{hold} = 150\\ \\mathrm{ps} - 50\\ \\mathrm{ps}$$\n$$S_{hold} = 100\\ \\mathrm{ps}$$\n\nThe hold slack is $100\\ \\mathrm{ps}$. Since the sign of the computed slack is positive ($S_{hold} > 0$), no hold violation occurs. The timing constraint is met with a margin of $100\\ \\mathrm{ps}$.",

The validation of the problem statement has determined it to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and free of contradictions or ambiguities. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nLet us define the timeline of events, using the active clock edge at the launching flip-flop as our reference time, $t = 0$.\nThe clock signal arrives at the launching flip-flop at times $0, T, 2T, \\ldots$.\nDue to clock skew, $t_{\\text{skew}}$, the clock signal arrives at the capturing flip-flop at times $t_{\\text{skew}}, T+t_{\\text{skew}}, 2T+t_{\\text{skew}}, \\ldots$. The skew is defined as the arrival time at the capture clock pin minus the arrival time at the launch clock pin.\n\nThe setup-time constraint dictates that the data signal must arrive at the input of the capturing flip-flop and be stable for a duration of at least the setup time, $t_{\\text{setup}}$, *before* the next active clock edge arrives at that same flip-flop.

So, the latest time the data leaves the launching flip-flop is $0 + t_{cq,\\max}$.\nThis signal then propagates through the combinational logic block, which has a maximum delay of $D_{\\max}$.\nTherefore, the latest arrival time of the data at the 'D' input of the capturing flip-flop, denoted as $t_{\\text{data\\_arrival}}$, is:\n$$t_{\\text{data\\_arrival}} = t_{cq,\\max} + D_{\\max}$$\n\n$2$. **Required Data Arrival Time at the Capturing Flip-Flop:**\nThe data launched at $t=0$ must be captured by the *next* clock edge. The next active clock edge at the launching flip-flop occurs at time $T$.\nThis next edge arrives at the capturing flip-flop at time $T + t_{\\text{skew}}$.\nFor the setup constraint to be satisfied, the data must be stable at the capturing flip-flop's input no later than $t_{\\text{setup}}$ before this capturing edge. The deadline for data arrival is therefore:\n$$t_{\\text{deadline}} = (T + t_{\\text{skew}}) - t_{\\text{setup}}$$\n\n$3$. **The Setup-Time Inequality:**\nTo prevent a setup-time violation, the actual data arrival time must be less than or equal to the required deadline.
