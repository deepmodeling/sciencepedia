            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated and found to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the fundamental principles of synchronous digital circuit timing, is well-posed with a unique and meaningful solution, and is expressed in objective, unambiguous language. All necessary parameters are provided, and the stated assumptions (zero clock skew and jitter) create a self-contained, solvable problem.\n\nWe begin by establishing a timing reference. Let us consider the operation of the circuit over one clock cycle. Let the clock period be denoted by $T$. We can set the time of an active clock edge at the launching register to be $t=0$.\n\nThe data stored in the launching register is launched onto the combinational path after the clock-to-output delay of the register. Therefore, the time at which the new data signal begins to propagate from the output of the launching register, which we define as the launch time, is:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{launch}} = 0 + t_{cq} = t_{cq}$$\n\nThis signal then propagates through the combinational logic block. To ensure correct operation under all conditions, we must consider the worst-case scenario, which corresponds to the longest possible delay through this logic. The maximum propagation delay is given as $D_{\\max}$. The data signal will therefore arrive at the input of the capturing register no later than the sum of the launch time and this maximum logic delay. We define this as the arrival time, $t_{\\mathrm{arrival}}$:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{arrival}} = t_{\\mathrm{launch}} + D_{\\max} = t_{cq} + D_{\\max}$$\n\nFor the capturing register to correctly sample this arriving data, the data signal must be stable at its input for a certain duration *before* the next active clock edge arrives. This duration is the setup time, $t_{\\mathrm{setup}}$. The next active clock edge at the capturing register occurs at time $t=T$ (since clock skew is assumed to be zero). Therefore, the data must be stable and valid at the input of the capturing register by a time $t_{\\mathrm{setup}}$ prior to $T$. This defines the required time, $t_{\\mathrm{required}}$:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{required}} = T - t_{\\mathrm{setup}}$$\n\nThe fundamental constraint for avoiding a setup time violation is that the data must arrive at the capturing register on or before the time it is required. This can be expressed as the following inequality:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{arrival}} \\le t_{\\mathrm{required}}$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $t_{\\mathrm{arrival}}$ and $t_{\\mathrm{required}}$ into this inequality yields the setup time constraint for the path:\n$$t_{cq} + D_{\\max} \\le T - t_{\\mathrm{setup}}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum feasible clock period, which we denote as $T_{\\min}$. This minimum period is found by rearranging the inequality to solve for $T$:\n$$T \\ge t_{cq} + D_{\\max} + t_{\\mathrm{setup}}$$\nThe minimum value of $T$ that satisfies this condition is the lower bound of the inequality. Thus,\n$$T_{\\min} = t_{cq} + D_{\\max} + t_{\\mathrm{setup}}$$\n\nWe are given the following numerical values for the timing parameters:\n- Clock-to-output time, $t_{cq} = 80\\ \\mathrm{ps}$\n- Maximum combinational delay, $D_{\\max} = 420\\ \\mathrm{ps}$\n- Setup time, $t_{\\mathrm{setup}} = 60\\ \\mathrm{ps}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $T_{\\min}$:\n$$T_{\\min} = 80\\ \\mathrm{ps} + 420\\ \\mathrm{ps} + 60\\ \\mathrm{ps}$$\n$$T_{\\min} = 500\\ \\mathrm{ps} + 60\\ \\mathrm{ps}$$\n$$T_{\\min} = 560\\ \\mathrm{ps}$$\n\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.

The clock is nominally periodic with period $T$, and the clock arrival time at the capturing flip-flop for the next cycle is offset relative to the clock arrival at the launching flip-flop by a clock skew $t_{\\text{skew}}$, defined as the capturing clock arrival time minus the launching clock arrival time. Assume a single clock domain and that the setup requirement must hold for the next clock cycle.\n\nYou are given the following worst-case parameters for the path:\n- Maximum clock-to-$Q$ delay of the launching flip-flop: $t_{cq,\\max} = 90\\ \\mathrm{ps}$.\n- Maximum combinational path delay between the two flip-flops: $D_{\\max} = 600\\ \\mathrm{ps}$.\n- Setup time of the capturing flip-flop: $t_{\\text{setup}} = 70\\ \\mathrm{ps}$.\n- Clock skew (capture minus launch): $t_{\\text{skew}} = -30\\ \\mathrm{ps}$, corresponding to a useful negative skew for hold but potentially detrimental for setup.\n\nStarting from the fundamental timing definitions for synchronous sequential circuits—namely, that the data launched at the launching flip-flop at the current active clock edge must arrive at the input of the capturing flip-flop and remain stable at least $t_{\\text{setup}}$ before the next active capturing clock edge—derive the inequality that enforces no setup-time violation in the presence of nonzero $t_{\\text{skew}}$. Then, use the provided parameter values to compute the minimum feasible clock period $T$ that satisfies the setup-time requirement under worst-case (maximum) delay conditions.\n\nExpress the final clock period in $\\mathrm{ns}$ and round your answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the minimum clock period $T$ for a synchronous digital circuit path, subject to a setup-time constraint. The validation of the problem statement has determined it to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and free of contradictions or ambiguities. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nLet us define the timeline of events, using the active clock edge at the launching flip-flop as our reference time, $t = 0$.\nThe clock signal arrives at the launching flip-flop at times $0, T, 2T, \\ldots$.\nDue to clock skew, $t_{\\text{skew}}$, the clock signal arrives at the capturing flip-flop at times $t_{\\text{skew}}, T+t_{\\text{skew}}, 2T+t_{\\text{skew}}, \\ldots$. The skew is defined as the arrival time at the capture clock pin minus the arrival time at the launch clock pin.\n\nThe setup-time constraint dictates that the data signal must arrive at the input of the capturing flip-flop and be stable for a duration of at least the setup time, $t_{\\text{setup}}$, *before* the next active clock edge arrives at that same flip-flop. We will analyze this using worst-case (maximum) delay values to ensure the constraint is met under all operational conditions.\n\n$1$. **Data Signal Propagation Time (Worst Case):**\nThe data is launched by the active clock edge at $t=0$ at the launching flip-flop.\nThe signal appears at the output 'Q' of the launching flip-flop after the clock-to-Q delay. The latest this can happen is given by $t_{cq,\\max}$. So, the latest time the data leaves the launching flip-flop is $0 + t_{cq,\\max}$.\nThis signal then propagates through the combinational logic block, which has a maximum delay of $D_{\\max}$.\nTherefore, the latest arrival time of the data at the 'D' input of the capturing flip-flop, denoted as $t_{\\text{data\\_arrival}}$, is:\n$$t_{\\text{data\\_arrival}} = t_{cq,\\max} + D_{\\max}$$\n\n$2$. **Required Data Arrival Time at the Capturing Flip-Flop:**\nThe data launched at $t=0$ must be captured by the *next* clock edge. The next active clock edge at the launching flip-flop occurs at time $T$.\nThis next edge arrives at the capturing flip-flop at time $T + t_{\\text{skew}}$.\nFor the setup constraint to be satisfied, the data must be stable at the capturing flip-flop's input no later than $t_{\\text{setup}}$ before this capturing edge. The deadline for data arrival is therefore:\n$$t_{\\text{deadline}} = (T + t_{\\text{skew}}) - t_{\\text{setup}}$$\n\n$3$. **The Setup-Time Inequality:**\nTo prevent a setup-time violation, the actual data arrival time must be less than or equal to the required deadline. This gives us the fundamental inequality for setup analysis:\n$$t_{\\text{data\\_arrival}} \\leq t_{\\text{deadline}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above, we obtain the inequality that must be satisfied:\n$$t_{cq,\\max} + D_{\\max} \\leq T + t_{\\text{skew}} - t_{\\text{setup}}$$\nThis is the formal inequality that enforces the setup-time requirement in the presence of clock skew.\n\n$4$. **Calculation of the Minimum Clock Period ($T_{\\min}$):**\nThe problem asks for the minimum feasible clock period, $T$. This occurs when the inequality is at its limit, i.e., when it becomes an equality. We can rearrange the inequality to solve for $T$:\n$$T \\geq t_{cq,\\max} + D_{\\max} + t_{\\text{setup}} - t_{\\text{skew}}$$\nThe minimum clock period, $T_{\\min}$, is thus given by:\n$$T_{\\min} = t_{cq,\\max} + D_{\\max} + t_{\\text{setup}} - t_{\\text{skew}}$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given parameter values into this equation:\n- Maximum clock-to-Q delay: $t_{cq,\\max} = 90\\ \\mathrm{ps}$\n- Maximum combinational path delay: $D_{\\max} = 600\\ \\mathrm{ps}$\n- Setup time: $t_{\\text{setup}} = 70\\ \\mathrm{ps}$\n- Clock skew: $t_{\\text{skew}} = -30\\ \\mathrm{ps}$\n\n$$T_{\\min} = 90\\ \\mathrm{ps} + 600\\ \\mathrm{ps} + 70\\ \\mathrm{ps} - (-30\\ \\mathrm{ps})$$\n$$T_{\\min} = 90 + 600 + 70 + 30\\ \\mathrm{ps}$$\n$$T_{\\min} = 790\\ \\mathrm{ps}$$\nThe negative skew shortens the effective time available for data propagation, thus increasing the minimum required clock period, which is correctly captured by the subtraction of a negative value.\n\nFinally, we must express the answer in nanoseconds ($\\mathrm{ns}$) and round to three significant figures.\nSince $1\\ \\mathrm{ns} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{ps}$, we have:\n$$T_{\\min} = 790 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{ns} = 0.790\\ \\mathrm{ns}$$\nThe value $0.790$ has three significant figures ($7$, $9$, and the trailing $0$), so no further rounding is needed.",

The pipeline input is registered, and the pipeline output is also registered. The pipeline thus has three stages: from input register to the register after $B_{1}$ (stage $S_{1}$), from the register after $B_{1}$ to the register after $B_{3}$ (stage $S_{2}$), and from the register after $B_{3}$ to the output register (stage $S_{3}$).

For a pipeline stage, the clock period must satisfy the setup time constraint:\n$$ T \\ge t_{cq}^{\\max} + d_{\\text{logic}}^{\\max} + t_{setup} + \\Delta t_{\\text{skew}}^{\\text{setup}} $$\nwhere $d_{\\text{logic}}^{\\max}$ is the maximum combinational logic delay of that stage. The clock skew term $\\Delta t_{\\text{skew}}^{\\text{setup}}$ is added because the problem states it adversely impacts setup, meaning the capture clock arrives later than the launch clock.\n\nThe hold time constraint must also be satisfied for correct operation:\n$$ t_{cq}^{\\min} + d_{\\text{logic}}^{\\min} \\ge t_{hold} + \\Delta t_{\\text{skew}}^{\\text{hold}} $$\nwhere $d_{\\text{logic}}^{\\min}$ is the minimum combinational logic delay of the stage. The clock skew term $\\Delta t_{\\text{skew}}^{\\text{hold}}$ is added to the right side because it adversely impacts hold, meaning the capture clock arrives earlier than the launch clock, making the hold condition harder to meet.\n\nLet's first analyze the initial pipeline configuration.\nThe combinational delays for each stage are:\n- Stage $S_{1}$: The logic is $B_{1}$. So, $d_{S_{1}}^{\\max} = d_{1}^{\\max} = 0.72~\\text{ns}$.\n- Stage $S_{2}$: The logic is $B_{2}$ followed by $B_{3}$. So, $d_{S_{2}}^{\\max} = d_{2}^{\\max} + d_{3}^{\\max} = 1.55~\\text{ns} + 1.26~\\text{ns} = 2.81~\\text{ns}$.\n- Stage $S_{3}$: The logic is $B_{4}$. So, $d_{S_{3}}^{\\max} = d_{4}^{\\max} = 0.62~\\text{ns}$.\n\nThe minimum required clock periods for each stage are:\n- $T_{S_{1}} \\ge 0.11 + 0.72 + 0.08 + 0.02 = 0.93~\\text{ns}$.\n- $T_{S_{2}} \\ge 0.11 + 2.81 + 0.08 + 0.02 = 3.02~\\text{ns}$.\n- $T_{S_{3}} \\ge 0.11 + 0.62 + 0.08 + 0.02 = 0.83~\\text{ns}$.\n\nThe initial clock period is the maximum of these: $T_{\\text{initial}} = \\max(0.93, 3.02, 0.83) = 3.02~\\text{ns}$. The critical path is in stage $S_{2}$.\n\nNow, we evaluate the two possible retiming options to minimize $T$.\n\n**Option 1: Move the register after $B_{3}$ backward to be between $B_{2}$ and $B_{3}$.**\nThe new pipeline stages are:\n- Stage $S'_{1}$: Logic is $B_{1}$. $d_{S'_{1}}^{\\max} = d_{1}^{\\max} = 0.72~\\text{ns}$.\n- Stage $S'_{2}$: Logic is $B_{2}$. $d_{S'_{2}}^{\\max} = d_{2}^{\\max} = 1.55~\\text{ns}$.\n- Stage $S'_{3}$: Logic is $B_{3}$ followed by $B_{4}$. $d_{S'_{3}}^{\\max} = d_{3}^{\\max} + d_{4}^{\\max} = 1.26~\\text{ns} + 0.62~\\text{ns} = 1.88~\\text{ns}$.\n\nThe minimum required clock periods for this configuration are:\n- $T_{S'_{1}} \\ge 0.11 + 0.72 + 0.08 + 0.02 = 0.93~\\text{ns}$.\n- $T_{S'_{2}} \\ge 0.11 + 1.55 + 0.08 + 0.02 = 1.76~\\text{ns}$.\n- $T_{S'_{3}} \\ge 0.11 + 1.88 + 0.08 + 0.02 = 2.09~\\text{ns}$.\n\nThe clock period for this option is $T_{\\text{opt1}} = \\max(0.93, 1.76, 2.09) = 2.09~\\text{ns}$.\n\n**Option 2: Move the register after $B_{1}$ forward to be between $B_{2}$ and $B_{3}$.**\nThe new pipeline stages are:\n- Stage $S''_{1}$: Logic is $B_{1}$ followed by $B_{2}$. $d_{S''_{1}}^{\\max} = d_{1}^{\\max} + d_{2}^{\\max} = 0.72~\\text{ns} + 1.55~\\text{ns} = 2.27~\\text{ns}$.\n- Stage $S''_{2}$: Logic is $B_{3}$. $d_{S''_{2}}^{\\max} = d_{3}^{\\max} = 1.26~\\text{ns}$.\n- Stage $S''_{3}$: Logic is $B_{4}$. $d_{S''_{3}}^{\\max} = d_{4}^{\\max} = 0.62~\\text{ns}$.\n\nThe minimum required clock periods for this configuration are:\n- $T_{S''_{1}} \\ge 0.11 + 2.27 + 0.08 + 0.02 = 2.48~\\text{ns}$.\n- $T_{S''_{2}} \\ge 0.11 + 1.26 + 0.08 + 0.02 = 1.47~\\text{ns}$.\n- $T_{S''_{3}} \\ge 0.11 + 0.62 + 0.08 + 0.02 = 0.83~\\text{ns}$.\n\nThe clock period for this option is $T_{\\text{opt2}} = \\max(2.48, 1.47, 0.83) = 2.48~\\text{ns}$.\n\nComparing the two options, $T_{\\text{opt1}} = 2.09~\\text{ns}$ is less than $T_{\\text{opt2}} = 2.48~\\text{ns}$. Thus, the optimal relocation is Option 1, which yields a minimized clock period of $T = 2.09~\\text{ns}$.\n\nFinally, we must verify that the hold constraints are met for the optimal configuration (Option 1).\nThe condition to check is $t_{cq}^{\\min} + d_{\\text{logic}}^{\\min} \\ge t_{hold} + \\Delta t_{\\text{skew}}^{\\text{hold}}$.\nThe right-hand side of the inequality is constant for all stages: $0.07~\\text{ns} + 0.03~\\text{ns} = 0.10~\\text{ns}$.\n\nWe need to calculate the minimum logic delays for each stage in Option 1:\n- Stage $S'_{1}$ (logic $B_{1}$): $d_{S'_{1}}^{\\min} = d_{1}^{\\min} = 0.21~\\text{ns}$.\n- Stage $S'_{2}$ (logic $B_{2}$): $d_{S'_{2}}^{\\min} = d_{2}^{\\min} = 0.48~\\text{ns}$.\n- Stage $S'_{3}$ (logic $B_{3} + B_{4}$): $d_{S'_{3}}^{\\min} = d_{3}^{\\min} + d_{4}^{\\min} = 0.41~\\text{ns} + 0.19~\\text{ns} = 0.60~\\text{ns}$.\n\nNow, we check the hold constraint for each stage:\n- Stage $S'_{1}$: $t_{cq}^{\\min} + d_{S'_{1}}^{\\min} = 0.06~\\text{ns} + 0.21~\\text{ns} = 0.27~\\text{ns}$. Since $0.27~\\text{ns} \\ge 0.10~\\text{ns}$, the constraint is met.\n- Stage $S'_{2}$: $t_{cq}^{\\min} + d_{S'_{2}}^{\\min} = 0.06~\\text{ns} + 0.48~\\text{ns} = 0.54~\\text{ns}$. Since $0.54~\\text{ns} \\ge 0.10~\\text{ns}$, the constraint is met.\n- Stage $S'_{3}$: $t_{cq}^{\\min} + d_{S'_{3}}^{\\min} = 0.06~\\text{ns} + 0.60~\\text{ns} = 0.66~\\text{ns}$. Since $0.66~\\text{ns} \\ge 0.10~\\text{ns}$, the constraint is met.\n\nAll hold constraints are satisfied for the optimized pipeline. The minimized clock period is $T = 2.09~\\text{ns}$. Rounding to four significant figures gives $2.090~\\text{ns}$.",
