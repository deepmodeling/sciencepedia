            "problem": "A Voltage-Controlled Delay Line (VCDL) composed of $M$ identical, cascaded tunable delay stages is embedded in a Delay-Locked Loop (DLL) for clock phase alignment in an Electronic Design Automation (EDA) flow. Each stage has an instantaneous propagation delay $\\tau(v_{c})$ that is strictly monotone with respect to a global control variable $v_{c}$, and is bounded between a minimum and maximum achievable delay, $\\tau_{\\min}$ and $\\tau_{\\max}$, at the control range endpoints. Assume all stages are identically controlled by the same $v_{c}$, and neglect noise and mismatch so that all stages share the same instantaneous delay at a given $v_{c}$. The DLL operates in the fundamental (one-period) lock mode, meaning the loop can lock only if the total VCDL delay equals the input reference period.\n\nFrom first principles, determine the total tuning range of the cascaded VCDL as a function of $M$, $\\tau_{\\min}$, and $\\tau_{\\max}$, and then determine the minimum integer $M$ that guarantees the DLL can lock to a given reference period $T_{\\text{ref}}$.

            "solution": "The Voltage-Controlled Delay Line (VCDL) consists of $M$ identical delay stages connected in series. The propagation delay of each individual stage, $\\tau(v_c)$, is a function of a global control variable $v_c$. Since all stages are identical and controlled by the same $v_c$, they all exhibit the same delay $\\tau(v_c)$ at any given instant.\n\nThe total propagation delay of the VCDL, $\\tau_{\\text{tot}}$, is the sum of the delays of the $M$ cascaded stages.\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{tot}}(v_c) = \\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\tau_i(v_c) = M \\cdot \\tau(v_c) $$\nThe problem states that the delay of each stage is bounded by a minimum value, $\\tau_{\\min}$, and a maximum value, $\\tau_{\\max}$.\n$$ \\tau_{\\min} \\le \\tau(v_c) \\le \\tau_{\\max} $$\nConsequently, the total delay of the VCDL is also bounded. The minimum total delay, $\\tau_{\\text{tot,min}}$, occurs when each stage is at its minimum delay $\\tau_{\\min}$.\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{tot,min}}(M) = M \\tau_{\\min} $$\nThe maximum total delay, $\\tau_{\\text{tot,max}}$, occurs when each stage is at its maximum delay $\\tau_{\\max}$.\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{tot,max}}(M) = M \\tau_{\\max} $$\nThe problem states that the stage delay $\\tau(v_c)$ is a strictly monotone function of $v_c$. By the Intermediate Value Theorem, as $v_c$ is varied across its control range, the stage delay $\\tau(v_c)$ takes on every value in the continuous interval $[\\tau_{\\min}, \\tau_{\\max}]$. Correspondingly, the total VCDL delay $\\tau_{\\text{tot}}(v_c)$ continuously covers the entire range $[\\tau_{\\text{tot,min}}(M), \\tau_{\\text{tot,max}}(M)]$.\nThe total tuning range of the VCDL is this interval, which can be represented by the ordered pair of its endpoints $(\\tau_{\\text{tot,min}}(M), \\tau_{\\text{tot,max}}(M))$. As functions of $M$, $\\tau_{\\min}$, and $\\tau_{\\max}$, these are $(M \\tau_{\\min}, M \\tau_{\\max})$.\n\nNext, we determine the minimum number of stages, $M_{\\min}$, required for the DLL to achieve lock. The problem specifies a \"fundamental (one-period) lock mode,\" where the lock condition is that the total delay of the VCDL must equal the period of the input reference clock, $T_{\\text{ref}}$.\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{tot}}(v_c) = T_{\\text{ref}} $$\nFor the DLL to be able to satisfy this condition, the value $T_{\\text{ref}}$ must lie within the achievable tuning range of the VCDL. This gives the following necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a lock point:\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{tot,min}}(M) \\le T_{\\text{ref}} \\le \\tau_{\\text{tot,max}}(M) $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the total delay bounds, we get a pair of inequalities for $M$:\n$$ M \\tau_{\\min} \\le T_{\\text{ref}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad M \\tau_{\\max} \\ge T_{\\text{ref}} $$\nThese can be rearranged to bound $M$:\n$$ \\frac{T_{\\text{ref}}}{\\tau_{\\max}} \\le M \\le \\frac{T_{\\text{ref}}}{\\tau_{\\min}} $$\nThe problem asks for the minimum integer $M$ that guarantees lock is possible. This corresponds to the smallest integer $M$ that satisfies the above compound inequality. The most restrictive condition for finding the *minimum* $M$ is the lower bound:\n$$ M \\ge \\frac{T_{\\text{ref}}}{\\tau_{\\max}} $$\nSince $M$ must be an integer, the minimum value for $M$, which we denote as $M_{\\min}$, is the smallest integer greater than or equal to $\\frac{T_{\\text{ref}}}{\\tau_{\\max}}$. This is given by the ceiling function:\n$$ M_{\\min} = \\left\\lceil \\frac{T_{\\text{ref}}}{\\tau_{\\max}} \\right\\rceil $$\nWe must verify that this minimum $M$ also satisfies the second inequality, $M_{\\min} \\le \\frac{T_{\\text{ref}}}{\\tau_{\\min}}$. This is guaranteed if the interval $[\\frac{T_{\\text{ref}}}{\\tau_{\\max}}, \\frac{T_{\\text{ref}}}{\\tau_{\\min}}]$ contains at least one integer, which is generally true for practical DLL designs where $\\tau_{\\max}$ is significantly larger than $\\tau_{\\min}$.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$$ \\tau_{\\min} = 20\\,\\text{ps} $$\n$$ \\tau_{\\max} = 60\\,\\text{ps} $$\n$$ T_{\\text{ref}} = 1\\,\\text{ns} = 1000\\,\\text{ps} $$\nUsing these values, we calculate the bounds for $M$:\n$$ \\frac{1000\\,\\text{ps}}{60\\,\\text{ps}} \\le M \\le \\frac{1000\\,\\text{ps}}{20\\,\\text{ps}} $$\n$$ \\frac{50}{3} \\le M \\le 50 $$\n$$ 16.66\\overline{6} \\le M \\le 50 $$\nThe minimum integer $M$ must satisfy $M \\ge 16.66\\overline{6}$. The smallest integer that meets this condition is $17$.\n$$ M_{\\min} = \\lceil 16.66\\overline{6} \\rceil = 17 $$\nFor $M=17$, the VCDL tuning range is $[17 \\times 20\\,\\text{ps}, 17 \\times 60\\,\\text{ps}] = [340\\,\\text{ps}, 1020\\,\\text{ps}]$. Since $T_{\\text{ref}} = 1000\\,\\text{ps}$ is within this range, a lock is achievable. For $M=16$, the maximum delay would be $16 \\times 60\\,\\text{ps} = 960\\,\\text{ps}$, which is less than $T_{\\text{ref}}$, so lock would be impossible. Thus, $M_{\\min} = 17$ is correct.\n\nThe final answer requires a row matrix containing the symbolic expressions for the tuning range endpoints and the calculated numerical value for $M_{\\min}$.\nThe components are:\n1.  $\\tau_{\\text{tot,min}}(M) = M \\tau_{\\min}$\n2.  $\\tau_{\\text{tot,max}}(M) = M \\tau_{\\max}$\n3.  $M_{\\min} = 17$",

Second, this general result is used with the specific parameters provided to calculate the root-mean-square (RMS) timing error.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Timing Error PSD**\n\nThe problem states that the VCDL delay perturbation, which we denote as the timing error $\\tau(t)$, is linearly sensitive to small perturbations in the local power supply voltage. Let the supply voltage at the VCDL be $V_{DD,VCDL}(t)$, which consists of a DC bias $V_{DD,bias}$ and a zero-mean noise component $v_{dd,VCDL}(t)$. The total delay is $T_D(V_{DD,VCDL}(t))$. The timing error is the perturbation around the nominal delay $T_{D,bias} = T_D(V_{DD,bias})$:\n$$ \\tau(t) = T_D(V_{DD,bias} + v_{dd,VCDL}(t)) - T_{D,bias} $$\nFor small-signal perturbations, we can linearize this relationship using the given supply sensitivity $K_{dd}$:\n$$ \\tau(t) \\approx \\left.\\frac{\\partial T_D}{\\partial V_{DD}}\\right|_{V_{DD,bias}} \\cdot v_{dd,VCDL}(t) = K_{dd} \\cdot v_{dd,VCDL}(t) $$\nThe supply noise at its source is $v_{dd}(t)$. This noise propagates to the VCDL through a Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) network characterized by the impulse response $h_s(t)$. The output of this LTI system, $v_{dd,VCDL}(t)$, is the convolution of the input $v_{dd}(t)$ with the impulse response $h_s(t)$:\n$$ v_{dd,VCDL}(t) = v_{dd}(t) * h_s(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} v_{dd}(\\xi) h_s(t-\\xi) \\, d\\xi $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\tau(t)$, we obtain the time-domain mapping from the source supply noise to the timing error:\n$$ \\tau(t) = K_{dd} \\left( v_{dd}(t) * h_s(t) \\right) $$\nTo find the PSD of the timing error, $S_\\tau(f)$, we move to the frequency domain. Let $\\mathcal{F}$ denote the Fourier transform.

The overall transformation from the input noise $v_{dd}(t)$ to the output timing error $\\tau(t)$ is an LTI system with a frequency response of $K_{dd} H_s(f)$.\n\nFor a WSS random process passing through an LTI system, the output PSD, $S_{out}(f)$, is related to the input PSD, $S_{in}(f)$, and the system's frequency response, $H(f)$, by $S_{out}(f) = S_{in}(f) |H(f)|^2$. Applying this rule to our system:\n$$ S_{\\tau}(f) = S_{v_{dd}}(f) \\cdot |K_{dd} H_s(f)|^2 $$\nSince $K_{dd}$ is a real constant, this simplifies to:\n$$ S_{\\tau}(f) = K_{dd}^2 \\cdot |H_s(f)|^2 \\cdot S_{v_{dd}}(f) $$\nThis equation gives the one-sided PSD of the timing error for $f \\ge 0$ in terms of the VCDL supply sensitivity, the supply network frequency response, and the supply noise PSD, as requested.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of RMS Timing Error**\n\nThe variance of the timing error, $\\sigma_\\tau^2$, is found by integrating its one-sided PSD, $S_\\tau(f)$, over the specified measurement bandwidth $[f_1, f_2]$. The RMS timing error is the square root of the variance.\n$$ \\sigma_{\\tau}^2 = \\int_{f_1}^{f_2} S_{\\tau}(f) \\, df $$\nWe are given the following specific forms for the terms in the integrand:\n- $K_{dd} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-10} \\,\\text{s/V}$\n- $|H_{s}(f)| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1 + (f/f_{c})^{2}}}$, so $|H_s(f)|^2 = \\frac{1}{1 + (f/f_{c})^2}$ with $f_c = 1.0 \\times 10^6 \\,\\text{Hz}$.\n- $S_{v_{dd}}(f) = S_w + \\frac{K_1}{f}$, with $S_w = 1.0 \\times 10^{-12} \\,\\text{V}^2/\\text{Hz}$ and $K_1 = 1.0 \\times 10^{-12} \\,\\text{V}^2$.\n- The integration limits are $f_1 = 1.0 \\times 10^3 \\,\\text{Hz}$ and $f_2 = 1.0 \\times 10^8 \\,\\text{Hz}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the variance integral:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\tau}^2 = \\int_{f_1}^{f_2} K_{dd}^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + (f/f_c)^2} \\right) \\left( S_w + \\frac{K_1}{f} \\right) \\, df $$\nWe can separate the integral into two parts, corresponding to the white noise and $1/f$ noise contributions:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\tau}^2 = K_{dd}^2 \\left( \\int_{f_1}^{f_2} \\frac{S_w}{1+(f/f_c)^2} \\, df + \\int_{f_1}^{f_2} \\frac{K_1}{f(1+(f/f_c)^2)} \\, df \\right) $$\nLet's evaluate each integral.\nThe first integral, $I_w$, is from the white noise:\n$$ I_w = S_w \\int_{f_1}^{f_2} \\frac{1}{1+(f/f_c)^2} \\, df $$\nUsing the substitution $u = f/f_c$, $df = f_c du$:\n$$ I_w = S_w f_c \\int_{f_1/f_c}^{f_2/f_c} \\frac{1}{1+u^2} \\, du = S_w f_c [\\arctan(u)]_{f_1/f_c}^{f_2/f_c} = S_w f_c \\left( \\arctan\\left(\\frac{f_2}{f_c}\\right) - \\arctan\\left(\\frac{f_1}{f_c}\\right) \\right) $$\nThe second integral, $I_{1/f}$, is from the $1/f$ noise:\n$$ I_{1/f} = K_1 \\int_{f_1}^{f_2} \\frac{1}{f(1+(f/f_c)^2)} \\, df = K_1 \\int_{f_1}^{f_2} \\frac{f_c^2}{f(f_c^2+f^2)} \\, df $$\nUsing partial fraction decomposition, $\\frac{f_c^2}{f(f_c^2+f^2)} = \\frac{1}{f} - \\frac{f}{f_c^2+f^2}$:\n$$ I_{1/f} = K_1 \\int_{f_1}^{f_2} \\left( \\frac{1}{f} - \\frac{f}{f_c^2+f^2} \\right) df = K_1 \\left[ \\ln(f) - \\frac{1}{2}\\ln(f_c^2+f^2) \\right]_{f_1}^{f_2} $$\n$$ I_{1/f} = K_1 \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{f}{\\sqrt{f_c^2+f^2}}\\right) \\right]_{f_1}^{f_2} = K_1 \\left( \\ln\\left(\\frac{f_2}{\\sqrt{f_c^2+f_2^2}}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{f_1}{\\sqrt{f_c^2+f_1^2}}\\right) \\right) = K_1 \\ln\\left( \\frac{f_2 \\sqrt{f_c^2+f_1^2}}{f_1 \\sqrt{f_c^2+f_2^2}} \\right) $$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values.\nThe ratios for the arctan arguments are $\\frac{f_2}{f_c} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^8}{1.0 \\times 10^6} = 100$ and $\\frac{f_1}{f_c} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^3}{1.0 \\times 10^6} = 0.001$.\n$$ I_w = (1.0 \\times 10^{-12}) (1.0 \\times 10^6) (\\arctan(100) - \\arctan(0.001)) $$\n$$ I_w \\approx (1.0 \\times 10^{-6}) (1.56079666 - 0.00099999967) = 1.55979666 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\text{V}^2 $$\nFor the $1/f$ integral's argument:\n$$ \\frac{f_2 \\sqrt{f_c^2+f_1^2}}{f_1 \\sqrt{f_c^2+f_2^2}} = \\frac{10^8 \\sqrt{(10^6)^2+(10^3)^2}}{10^3 \\sqrt{(10^6)^2+(10^8)^2}} = 10^5 \\frac{\\sqrt{10^{12}+10^6}}{\\sqrt{10^{12}+10^{16}}} = 10^5 \\frac{10^6 \\sqrt{1+10^{-6}}}{10^8 \\sqrt{1+10^{-4}}} = 1000 \\frac{\\sqrt{1.000001}}{\\sqrt{1.0001}} \\approx 999.9505 $$\n$$ I_{1/f} = (1.0 \\times 10^{-12}) \\ln(999.9505) \\approx (1.0 \\times 10^{-12}) (6.907705) = 6.907705 \\times 10^{-12} \\,\\text{V}^2 $$\nThe total integrated noise voltage variance is:\n$$ \\sigma_v^2 = I_w + I_{1/f} = 1.55979666 \\times 10^{-6} + 6.907705 \\times 10^{-12} = 1.55980357 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\text{V}^2 $$\nThe variance of the timing error is:\n$$ \\sigma_\\tau^2 = K_{dd}^2 \\cdot \\sigma_v^2 = (1.0 \\times 10^{-10})^2 \\cdot (1.55980357 \\times 10^{-6}) $$\n$$ \\sigma_\\tau^2 = (1.0 \\times 10^{-20}) \\cdot (1.55980357 \\times 10^{-6}) = 1.55980357 \\times 10^{-26} \\,\\text{s}^2 $$\nFinally, the RMS timing error is the square root of the variance:\n$$ \\sigma_\\tau = \\sqrt{1.55980357 \\times 10^{-26}} = 1.24892096 \\times 10^{-13} \\,\\text{s} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$ \\sigma_\\tau \\approx 1.249 \\times 10^{-13} \\,\\text{s} $$",
