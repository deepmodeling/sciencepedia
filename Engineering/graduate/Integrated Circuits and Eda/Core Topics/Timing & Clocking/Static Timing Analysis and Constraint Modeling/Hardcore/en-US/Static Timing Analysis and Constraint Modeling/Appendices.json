The problem is self-contained, with all necessary data provided to calculate the requested quantities. The setup is logically consistent and well-posed, leading to a unique and meaningful solution. The problem's structure is clear and its language is precise and objective.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### SOLUTION\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the data arrival time ($DAT$) at the capturing register's input $D$ and the setup slack for the timing path. This analysis is based on the fundamental principles of static timing analysis for a single-clock synchronous design. We will first convert all time units to a consistent base, picoseconds ($\\text{ps}$).\n\n$T_{\\text{clk}} = 1\\ \\text{ns} = 1000\\ \\text{ps}$.\nAll other delay values are already provided in picoseconds.\n\n**1. Data Arrival Time ($DAT$)**\n\nThe Data Arrival Time at a point in a circuit is the time, measured from the start of the clock cycle (time $0$), at which a signal transition arrives at that point. For the input $D$ of the capturing register, the $DAT$ is the sum of the time of the launch clock edge, the clock-to-$Q$ delay ($t_{\\text{cq}}$) of the launching register, and the total propagation delay of the combinational logic and nets ($t_{\\text{path}}$) between the launching register's output $Q$ and the capturing register's input $D$.\n\nThe problem states the launch clock edge occurs at time $t_{\\text{launch\\_abs}} = 0\\ \\text{s}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total path delay, $t_{\\text{path}}$, which is the sum of all specified gate and net delays:\n$$\nt_{\\text{path}} = t_{\\text{net}(Q \\to G_1)} + t_{\\text{gate}(G_1)} + t_{\\text{net}(G_1 \\to G_2)} + t_{\\text{gate}(G_2)} + t_{\\text{net}(G_2 \\to G_3)} + t_{\\text{gate}(G_3)} + t_{\\text{net}(G_3 \\to D)}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nt_{\\text{path}} = 10\\ \\text{ps} + 50\\ \\text{ps} + 20\\ \\text{ps} + 30\\ \\text{ps} + 15\\ \\text{ps} + 40\\ \\text{ps} + 20\\ \\text{ps} = 185\\ \\text{ps}\n$$\nThe Data Arrival Time at the input $D$ of the capturing register, denoted as $DAT_D$, is:\n$$\nDAT_D = t_{\\text{launch\\_abs}} + t_{\\text{cq}} + t_{\\text{path}}\n$$\n$$\nDAT_D = 0\\ \\text{ps} + 35\\ \\text{ps} + 185\\ \\text{ps} = 220\\ \\text{ps}\n$$\n\n**2. Required Arrival Time ($RAT$) and Setup Slack**\n\nThe Required Arrival Time ($RAT$) for a setup check is the latest possible time the data signal can arrive at the register's input $D$ without violating the setup-time constraint. This time is determined by the arrival time of the capturing clock edge and the register's setup time ($t_{\\text{setup}}$).\n\nThe setup constraint dictates that the data launched in one clock cycle must arrive and be stable at the capture register's input at least $t_{\\text{setup}}$ before the clock edge that captures it, which is one clock period later.\n\nThe arrival time of the launch clock at the launching register's clock pin is given as $t_{\\text{launch\\_clk}} = 0$. The skew is $s = t_{\\text{launch\\_clk}} - t_{\\text{capture\\_clk}} = -20\\ \\text{ps}$. We can find the arrival time of the clock at the capturing register's clock pin:\n$$\n-20\\ \\text{ps} = 0 - t_{\\text{capture\\_clk}} \\implies t_{\\text{capture\\_clk}} = 20\\ \\text{ps}\n$$\nThe clock edge that captures the data launched at time $0$ occurs one clock period later. The absolute time of this capturing clock edge at the capture register is:\n$$\nt_{\\text{capture\\_edge}} = T_{\\text{clk}} + t_{\\text{capture\\_clk}} = 1000\\ \\text{ps} + 20\\ \\text{ps} = 1020\\ \\text{ps}\n$$\nThe data must be stable at input $D$ at least $t_{\\text{setup}}$ before this edge. Thus, the Required Arrival Time at $D$ is:\n$$\nRAT_D = t_{\\text{capture\\_edge}} - t_{\\text{setup}} = 1020\\ \\text{ps} - 50\\ \\text{ps} = 970\\ \\text{ps}\n$$\nSetup slack ($Slack_{\\text{setup}}$) is the margin by which the timing is met. It is defined as the difference between the Required Arrival Time and the Data Arrival Time:\n$$\nSlack_{\\text{setup}} = RAT_D - DAT_D\n$$\n$$\nSlack_{\\text{setup}} = 970\\ \\text{ps} - 220\\ \\text{ps} = 750\\ \\text{ps}\n$$\nA positive slack indicates that the setup timing constraint is met.\n\nAlternatively, the setup slack can be calculated directly from the standard STA setup equation:\n$$\nSlack_{\\text{setup}} = T_{\\text{clk}} - s - (t_{\\text{cq}} + t_{\\text{path}}) - t_{\\text{setup}}\n$$\nPlugging in the values:\n$$\nSlack_{\\text{setup}} = 1000\\ \\text{ps} - (-20\\ \\text{ps}) - (35\\ \\text{ps} + 185\\ \\text{ps}) - 50\\ \\text{ps}\n$$\n$$\nSlack_{\\text{setup}} = 1000\\ \\text{ps} + 20\\ \\text{ps} - 220\\ \\text{ps} - 50\\ \\text{ps}\n$$\n$$\nSlack_{\\text{setup}} = 1020\\ \\text{ps} - 270\\ \\text{ps} = 750\\ \\text{ps}\n$$\nBoth methods yield the same result, confirming the calculation.\n\n**3. Final Answer Formatting**\n\nThe problem asks for the Data Arrival Time and the setup slack to be expressed in nanoseconds ($\\text{ns}$) and rounded to four significant figures.\n\nData Arrival Time:\n$$\nDAT_D = 220\\ \\text{ps} = 0.220\\ \\text{ns}\n$$\nTo four significant figures, this is $0.2200\\ \\text{ns}$.\n\nSetup Slack:\n$$\nSlack_{\\text{setup}} = 750\\ \\text{ps} = 0.750\\ \\text{ns}\n$$\nTo four significant figures, this is $0.7500\\ \\text{ns}$.\n\nThe final answer is a pair of values: the data arrival time and the setup slack.",

            "problem": "A synchronous pipeline stage in a complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuit is analyzed using Static Timing Analysis (STA) within the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) flow. Both the launch and capture flip-flops are driven by a single clock domain that traverses a clock distribution network. The clock network contains a common portion of buffers and interconnect shared by both the launch and capture paths with a nominal summed delay of $D_{\\mathrm{sh}} = 200\\ \\mathrm{ps}$. The clock period is $T_{\\mathrm{clk}} = 1\\ \\mathrm{ns}$. The data path from the launch flip-flop output to the capture flip-flop input has a worst-case delay of $D_{\\mathrm{data}} = 900\\ \\mathrm{ps}$, where this value reflects late (maximum) derating already applied to the data path under On-Chip Variation (OCV).\n\nAssume On-Chip Variation (OCV) is modeled by multiplicative derates of the form $1 \\pm \\alpha$, with $\\alpha = 0.1$.

The concepts of OCV, derating, setup slack, and CPPR are standard and well-defined. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters to compute a unique solution. The given numerical values ($T_{\\mathrm{clk}} = 1\\ \\mathrm{ns}$ for a $1\\ \\mathrm{GHz}$ clock, path delays in hundreds of picoseconds, and a $10\\%$ variation factor) are physically realistic for modern CMOS technologies. The language is objective and precise. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n**Derivation of Setup Slack**\n\nThe setup slack, $S_{\\mathrm{setup}}$, is defined as the difference between the required time for data to be stable at the capture flip-flop's input and the actual arrival time of the data.\n$$S_{\\mathrm{setup}} = \\text{Required Time} - \\text{Arrival Time}$$\n\n**1. Arrival Time (AT)**\nThe arrival time, $T_{\\mathrm{AT}}$, is the time at which the data signal, launched from the source flip-flop, arrives at the data input of the destination (capture) flip-flop. This is the sum of the clock path delay to the launch flip-flop and the data path delay.\n\nFor a worst-case setup analysis, we must consider the latest possible data arrival. This occurs when the launch clock edge is late and the data path is slow. The clock path to the launch flip-flop consists solely of the shared path with nominal delay $D_{\\mathrm{sh}}$. A late path is derated by a factor of $1 + \\alpha$. The data path delay, $D_{\\mathrm{data}}$, is already given as the worst-case (late-derated) value.\n\nThe clock arrival time at the launch flip-flop, $T_{\\mathrm{clk, launch}}$, is:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{clk, launch}} = D_{\\mathrm{sh}} (1 + \\alpha)$$\n\nThe total arrival time at the capture flip-flop's data input is:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{AT}} = T_{\\mathrm{clk, launch}} + D_{\\mathrm{data}} = D_{\\mathrm{sh}} (1 + \\alpha) + D_{\\mathrm{data}}$$\n\n**2. Required Time (RT)**\nThe required time, $T_{\\mathrm{RT}}$, is the latest time the data signal can arrive at the capture flip-flop's input without violating the setup constraint. This is determined by the arrival of the *next* clock edge at the capture flip-flop.\n\nFor a worst-case setup analysis, the timing window is tightened by assuming the capture clock edge arrives as early as possible. An early path is derated by a factor of $1 - \\alpha$. The capture clock edge occurs one clock period, $T_{\\mathrm{clk}}$, after the launch edge. The clock path to the capture flip-flop is also the shared path $D_{\\mathrm{sh}}$. The setup time requirement ($T_{\\mathrm{setup}}$) and clock uncertainty ($T_{\\mathrm{unc}}$) are given as negligible, so we take them to be $0$.\n\nThe clock arrival time at the capture flip-flop, $T_{\\mathrm{clk, capture}}$, is:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{clk, capture}} = T_{\\mathrm{clk}} + D_{\\mathrm{sh}} (1 - \\alpha)$$\n\nThe total required time is therefore:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{RT}} = T_{\\mathrm{clk, capture}} - T_{\\mathrm{setup}} - T_{\\mathrm{unc}} = T_{\\mathrm{clk}} + D_{\\mathrm{sh}} (1 - \\alpha) - 0 - 0 = T_{\\mathrm{clk}} + D_{\\mathrm{sh}} (1 - \\alpha)$$\n\n**3. Setup Slack before CPPR**\nWithout CPPR, the setup slack is calculated directly from $T_{\\mathrm{RT}}$ and $T_{\\mathrm{AT}}$:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{setup, uncorrected}} = T_{\\mathrm{RT}} - T_{\\mathrm{AT}}$$\n$$S_{\\mathrm{setup, uncorrected}} = \\left( T_{\\mathrm{clk}} + D_{\\mathrm{sh}}(1 - \\alpha) \\right) - \\left( D_{\\mathrm{sh}}(1 + \\alpha) + D_{\\mathrm{data}} \\right)$$\n$$S_{\\mathrm{setup, uncorrected}} = T_{\\mathrm{clk}} + D_{\\mathrm{sh}} - \\alpha D_{\\mathrm{sh}} - D_{\\mathrm{sh}} - \\alpha D_{\\mathrm{sh}} - D_{\\mathrm{data}}$$\n$$S_{\\mathrm{setup, uncorrected}} = T_{\\mathrm{clk}} - D_{\\mathrm{data}} - 2 \\alpha D_{\\mathrm{sh}}$$\nThe term $-2 \\alpha D_{\\mathrm{sh}}$ represents artificial pessimism. It arises because the analysis assumes the single common clock path $D_{\\mathrm{sh}}$ is simultaneously slow (for the launch path) and fast (for the capture path), which is physically impossible.\n\n**4. Common Path Pessimism Removal (CPPR)**\nCPPR corrects this by calculating the amount of artificial pessimism on the common path and adding it back to the slack as a credit. The pessimism credit, $C_{\\mathrm{CPPR}}$, is the difference between the late and early derated delays of the common path.\n$$C_{\\mathrm{CPPR}} = (\\text{Late derated common path delay}) - (\\text{Early derated common path delay})$$\n$$C_{\\mathrm{CPPR}} = \\left( D_{\\mathrm{sh}}(1 + \\alpha) \\right) - \\left( D_{\\mathrm{sh}}(1 - \\alpha) \\right)$$\n$$C_{\\mathrm{CPPR}} = D_{\\mathrm{sh}} + \\alpha D_{\\mathrm{sh}} - D_{\\mathrm{sh}} + \\alpha D_{\\mathrm{sh}} = 2 \\alpha D_{\\mathrm{sh}}$$\n\n**5. Final CPPR-Corrected Slack**\nThe final, corrected setup slack, $S_{\\mathrm{setup, final}}$, is the uncorrected slack plus the CPPR credit.\n$$S_{\\mathrm{setup, final}} = S_{\\mathrm{setup, uncorrected}} + C_{\\mathrm{CPPR}}$$\n$$S_{\\mathrm{setup, final}} = \\left( T_{\\mathrm{clk}} - D_{\\mathrm{data}} - 2 \\alpha D_{\\mathrm{sh}} \\right) + \\left( 2 \\alpha D_{\\mathrm{sh}} \\right)$$\n$$S_{\\mathrm{setup, final}} = T_{\\mathrm{clk}} - D_{\\mathrm{data}}$$\nThis result is intuitive: for a path with a fully common clock network, the clock skew is zero, and the setup check simplifies to ensuring the data path delay is less than the clock period.\n\n**6. Numerical Calculation**\nWe are given the following values:\n- $T_{\\mathrm{clk}} = 1\\ \\mathrm{ns} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{ps}$\n- $D_{\\mathrm{data}} = 900\\ \\mathrm{ps}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the final expression for setup slack:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{setup, final}} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{ps} - 900\\ \\mathrm{ps} = 100\\ \\mathrm{ps}$$\nThe final corrected setup slack is $100\\ \\mathrm{ps}$. The values of $D_{\\mathrm{sh}}$ and $\\alpha$ are not needed for the final calculation after the CPPR logic is applied, as they only contribute to the pessimistic term that is subsequently removed.",
