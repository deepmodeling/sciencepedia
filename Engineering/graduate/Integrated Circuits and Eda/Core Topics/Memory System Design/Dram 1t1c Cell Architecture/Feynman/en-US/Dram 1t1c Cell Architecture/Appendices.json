            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the minimum storage capacitance, denoted as $C_{C}$, for a one-transistor/one-capacitor ($1$T$1$C$) DRAM cell, given a set of worst-case operating conditions. The derivation must start from the fundamental definitions of charge and current, and the constitutive relation for a capacitor.\n\nFirst, we state the definition of electric current, $I$, as the rate of change of electric charge, $Q$, with respect to time, $t$. This is expressed differentially as:\n$$I = \\frac{dQ}{dt}$$\nThe problem specifies a constant leakage current magnitude, $I_{\\text{leak}}$, over the refresh interval $t_{\\text{REF}}$. For a constant current, the total charge $\\Delta Q$ that flows during a time interval $\\Delta t$ is given by $\\Delta Q = I \\cdot \\Delta t$. In our case, the magnitude of the total charge lost from the storage node, $|\\Delta Q_{\\text{lost}}|$, over the time $t_{\\text{REF}}$ is:\n$$|\\Delta Q_{\\text{lost}}| = I_{\\text{leak}} \\cdot t_{\\text{REF}}$$\n\nSecond, we state the constitutive relation for a linear capacitor, which relates the charge stored, $Q_C$, to the voltage across the capacitor, $V_C$, through the capacitance, $C_C$:\n$$Q_C = C_C V_C$$\nAssuming that $C_C$ is a constant value, a change in the stored charge, $\\Delta Q_C$, will result in a proportional change in the voltage, $\\Delta V_C$:\n$$\\Delta Q_C = C_C \\Delta V_C$$\nThe magnitude of this relationship is $|\\Delta Q_C| = |C_C \\Delta V_C|$. Since $C_C$ is a positive physical quantity, this simplifies to:\n$$|\\Delta Q_C| = C_C |\\Delta V_C|$$\n\nThe charge lost due to leakage, $\\Delta Q_{\\text{lost}}$, is precisely the change in charge on the capacitor, $\\Delta Q_C$. Therefore, we can equate the magnitudes:\n$$|\\Delta Q_C| = |\\Delta Q_{\\text{lost}}|$$\nSubstituting the expressions from the principles above yields:\n$$C_C |\\Delta V_C| = I_{\\text{leak}} \\cdot t_{\\text{REF}}$$\nThis equation provides the core relationship between the voltage droop $|\\Delta V_C|$ and the physical parameters of the system.\n\nThe problem imposes a constraint on the maximum permissible voltage droop to ensure reliable sensing. The magnitude of the storage-node voltage change, $|\\Delta V_C|$, must not exceed the specified budget $\\Delta V_{\\text{max}}$:\n$$|\\Delta V_C| \\le \\Delta V_{\\text{max}}$$\nTo find the minimum capacitance, $C_{C, \\text{min}}$, that satisfies this condition, we consider the worst-case scenario where the voltage droop reaches its maximum allowed value, i.e., $|\\Delta V_C| = \\Delta V_{\\text{max}}$. Substituting this into our derived relationship gives:\n$$C_C \\cdot \\Delta V_{\\text{max}} \\ge I_{\\text{leak}} \\cdot t_{\\text{REF}}$$\nSolving for the capacitance $C_C$, we get:\n$$C_C \\ge \\frac{I_{\\text{leak}} \\cdot t_{\\text{REF}}}{\\Delta V_{\\text{max}}}$$\nThe minimum required capacitance is thus given by the equality:\n$$C_{C, \\text{min}} = \\frac{I_{\\text{leak}} \\cdot t_{\\text{REF}}}{\\Delta V_{\\text{max}}}$$\n\nWe are provided with the following numerical values for the worst-case conditions:\n- $I_{\\text{leak}} = 37\\,\\text{fA} = 37 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\text{A}$\n- $t_{\\text{REF}} = 64\\,\\text{ms} = 64 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{s}$\n- $\\Delta V_{\\text{max}} = 80\\,\\text{mV} = 80 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{V}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $C_{C, \\text{min}}$:\n$$C_{C, \\text{min}} = \\frac{(37 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\text{A}) \\cdot (64 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{s})}{80 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{V}}$$\nThe unit of the result is $\\text{A} \\cdot \\text{s} / \\text{V}$, which is the Farad ($\\text{F}$).

There are no subjective or opinion-based statements.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A detailed solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem asks for the minimum wordline voltage, $V_{\\text{WL}}$, required to write a full logic high ($V_{\\text{DD}}$) into a 1T1C DRAM cell.\n\nIn a write-high operation, the bitline is pre-charged and held at $V_{\\text{DD}}$. The wordline is asserted, turning on the nMOSFET access transistor. This allows current to flow from the bitline to the storage capacitor, charging it. In this configuration, the bitline acts as the drain and the storage capacitor node acts as the source of the nMOSFET.\n\nLet's define the voltages at the transistor terminals:\n- Gate voltage: $V_G = V_{\\text{WL}}$\n- Drain voltage: $V_D = V_{\\text{BL}} = V_{\\text{DD}}$\n- Source voltage: $V_S = V_{\\text{cell}}$, where $V_{\\text{cell}}$ is the voltage on the storage capacitor.\n- Body voltage: $V_B = 0$ (as it is tied to ground).\n\nAs the capacitor charges, $V_{\\text{cell}}$ increases. The transistor conducts as long as its gate-to-source voltage, $V_{\\text{GS}}$, is greater than its threshold voltage, $V_{\\text{TH}}$.\nThe gate-to-source voltage is $V_{\\text{GS}} = V_G - V_S = V_{\\text{WL}} - V_{\\text{cell}}$.\n\nThe threshold voltage $V_{\\text{TH}}$ is not constant; it increases as $V_S$ increases due to the body effect. The source-to-body voltage is $V_{\\text{SB}} = V_S - V_B = V_{\\text{cell}} - 0 = V_{\\text{cell}}$.\nSubstituting $V_{\\text{SB}} = V_{\\text{cell}}$ into the given equation for $V_{\\text{TH}}$:\n$$V_{\\text{TH}}(V_{\\text{cell}}) = V_{\\text{TH}0} + \\gamma\\left(\\sqrt{2\\phi_{F} + V_{\\text{cell}}} - \\sqrt{2\\phi_{F}}\\right)$$\n\nAccording to the problem statement, conduction stops when $V_{\\text{GS}} = V_{\\text{TH}}$. At this point, the capacitor can no longer charge, and $V_{\\text{cell}}$ reaches its maximum possible value for a given $V_{\\text{WL}}$. The condition is:\n$$V_{\\text{WL}} - V_{\\text{cell}} = V_{\\text{TH}}(V_{\\text{cell}})$$\n\nFor a full-level write, the capacitor must charge all the way to $V_{\\text{DD}}$. This means the transistor must remain conductive until $V_{\\text{cell}}$ reaches $V_{\\text{DD}}$. The minimum wordline voltage, $V_{\\text{WL}}$, is the voltage at which the transistor just ceases to conduct as $V_{\\text{cell}}$ equals $V_{\\text{DD}}$.\nWe set $V_{\\text{cell}} = V_{\\text{DD}}$ in the stopping condition:\n$$V_{\\text{WL}} - V_{\\text{DD}} = V_{\\text{TH}}(V_{\\text{DD}})$$\n\nNow, we evaluate $V_{\\text{TH}}$ at $V_{\\text{SB}} = V_{\\text{cell}} = V_{\\text{DD}}$:\n$$V_{\\text{TH}}(V_{\\text{DD}}) = V_{\\text{TH}0} + \\gamma\\left(\\sqrt{2\\phi_{F} + V_{\\text{DD}}} - \\sqrt{2\\phi_{F}}\\right)$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $V_{\\text{TH}}(V_{\\text{DD}})$ into the equation for $V_{\\text{WL}}$:\n$$V_{\\text{WL}} - V_{\\text{DD}} = V_{\\text{TH}0} + \\gamma\\left(\\sqrt{2\\phi_{F} + V_{\\text{DD}}} - \\sqrt{2\\phi_{F}}\\right)$$\n\nSolving for the minimum required wordline voltage, $V_{\\text{WL}}$:\n$$V_{\\text{WL}} = V_{\\text{DD}} + V_{\\text{TH}0} + \\gamma\\left(\\sqrt{2\\phi_{F} + V_{\\text{DD}}} - \\sqrt{2\\phi_{F}}\\right)$$\nThis is the derived expression for the minimum wordline voltage. If $V_{\\text{WL}}$ were any lower, the transistor would turn off before $V_{\\text{cell}}$ could reach $V_{\\text{DD}}$.\n\nThe problem then asks for the wordline boost, defined as $V_{\\text{boost}} = V_{\\text{WL}} - V_{\\text{DD}}$. From our derivation, we can see directly that:\n$$V_{\\text{boost}} = V_{\\text{TH}0} + \\gamma\\left(\\sqrt{2\\phi_{F} + V_{\\text{DD}}} - \\sqrt{2\\phi_{F}}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression:\n$V_{\\text{DD}} = 0.6$\n$V_{\\text{TH}0} = 0.35$\n$\\gamma = 0.4$\n$\\phi_{F} = 0.35$\n\nAll values are in SI units (Volts), so we can proceed with the calculation.\n$$V_{\\text{boost}} = 0.35 + 0.4\\left(\\sqrt{2(0.35) + 0.6} - \\sqrt{2(0.35)}\\right)$$\n$$V_{\\text{boost}} = 0.35 + 0.4\\left(\\sqrt{0.7 + 0.6} - \\sqrt{0.7}\\right)$$\n$$V_{\\text{boost}} = 0.35 + 0.4\\left(\\sqrt{1.3} - \\sqrt{0.7}\\right)$$\n\nWe compute the values of the square roots:\n$\\sqrt{1.3} \\approx 1.140175$\n$\\sqrt{0.7} \\approx 0.836660$\n\nSubstituting these back into the expression for $V_{\\text{boost}}$:\n$$V_{\\text{boost}} \\approx 0.35 + 0.4(1.140175 - 0.836660)$$\n$$V_{\\text{boost}} \\approx 0.35 + 0.4(0.303515)$$\n$$V_{\\text{boost}} \\approx 0.35 + 0.121406$$\n$$V_{\\text{boost}} \\approx 0.471406$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the result to three significant figures.\n$$V_{\\text{boost}} \\approx 0.471$$\nThe required wordline boost is approximately $0.471$ volts.\nThis means the minimum wordline voltage must be $V_{\\text{WL}} = V_{\\text{DD}} + V_{\\text{boost}} \\approx 0.6 + 0.471 = 1.071$ volts to ensure a full-level write.\nThe final answer is the value of $V_{\\text{boost}}$.",

The total charge $Q_{\\text{total}}$ is constant for $t \\ge 0$.\n$$Q_{\\text{total}} = C_{\\text{BL}} v_{\\text{BL}}(t) + C_C v_C(t) = C_{\\text{BL}} v_{\\text{BL}}(0) + C_C v_C(0) = C_{\\text{BL}} V_{\\text{BL0}} + C_C V_{\\text{cell0}}$$\nWe now have a system of two algebraic equations for $v_{\\text{BL}}(t)$ and $v_C(t)$:\n1. $v_C(t) = v_{\\text{BL}}(t) - (V_{\\text{BL0}} - V_{\\text{cell0}}) e^{-t/\\tau}$\n2. $C_{\\text{BL}} v_{\\text{BL}}(t) + C_C v_C(t) = C_{\\text{BL}} V_{\\text{BL0}} + C_C V_{\\text{cell0}}$\n\nSubstituting (1) into (2):\n$$C_{\\text{BL}} v_{\\text{BL}}(t) + C_C \\left[v_{\\text{BL}}(t) - (V_{\\text{BL0}} - V_{\\text{cell0}}) e^{-t/\\tau}\\right] = C_{\\text{BL}} V_{\\text{BL0}} + C_C V_{\\text{cell0}}$$\n$$(C_{\\text{BL}} + C_C) v_{\\text{BL}}(t) = C_{\\text{BL}} V_{\\text{BL0}} + C_C V_{\\text{cell0}} + C_C (V_{\\text{BL0}} - V_{\\text{cell0}}) e^{-t/\\tau}$$\nSolving for $v_{\\text{BL}}(t)$:\n$$v_{\\text{BL}}(t) = \\frac{C_{\\text{BL}} V_{\\text{BL0}} + C_C V_{\\text{cell0}}}{C_{\\text{BL}} + C_C} + \\frac{C_C(V_{\\text{BL0}} - V_{\\text{cell0}})}{C_{\\text{BL}} + C_C} e^{-t/\\tau}$$\nThis completes the derivation of $v_{\\text{BL}}(t)$.\n\nNext, we derive the bitline differential voltage $\\Delta V_{\\text{BL}}(t) = v_{\\text{BL}}(t) - V_{\\text{BL0}}$:\n$$\\Delta V_{\\text{BL}}(t) = \\left( \\frac{C_{\\text{BL}} V_{\\text{BL0}} + C_C V_{\\text{cell0}}}{C_{\\text{BL}} + C_C} - V_{\\text{BL0}} \\right) + \\frac{C_C(V_{\\text{BL0}} - V_{\\text{cell0}})}{C_{\\text{BL}} + C_C} e^{-t/\\tau}$$\nThe first term is the asymptotic voltage shift, $\\Delta V_{\\text{BL,}\\infty}$, as $t \\to \\infty$:\n$$\\Delta V_{\\text{BL,}\\infty} = \\frac{C_{\\text{BL}} V_{\\text{BL0}} + C_C V_{\\text{cell0}} - V_{\\text{BL0}}(C_{\\text{BL}} + C_C)}{C_{\\text{BL}} + C_C} = \\frac{C_C(V_{\\text{cell0}} - V_{\\text{BL0}})}{C_{\\text{BL}} + C_C}$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\Delta V_{\\text{BL}}(t)$:\n$$\\Delta V_{\\text{BL}}(t) = \\Delta V_{\\text{BL,}\\infty} - \\Delta V_{\\text{BL,}\\infty} e^{-t/\\tau} = \\Delta V_{\\text{BL,}\\infty} (1 - e^{-t/\\tau})$$\nThe initial cell voltage is $V_{\\text{cell0}} \\in \\{0, V_{\\text{DD}}\\}$ and $V_{\\text{BL0}} = V_{\\text{DD}}/2$.\n- If $V_{\\text{cell0}} = V_{\\text{DD}}$ (stored '$1$'), $\\Delta V_{\\text{BL,}\\infty} = \\frac{C_C}{C_{\\text{BL}} + C_C}(V_{\\text{DD}} - \\frac{V_{\\text{DD}}}{2}) = \\frac{C_C}{C_{\\text{BL}} + C_C} \\frac{V_{\\text{DD}}}{2}$.\n- If $V_{\\text{cell0}} = 0$ (stored '$0$'), $\\Delta V_{\\text{BL,}\\infty} = \\frac{C_C}{C_{\\text{BL}} + C_C}(0 - \\frac{V_{\\text{DD}}}{2}) = -\\frac{C_C}{C_{\\text{BL}} + C_C} \\frac{V_{\\text{DD}}}{2}$.\nThe magnitude of the asymptotic shift is the same in both cases:\n$$|\\Delta V_{\\text{BL,}\\infty}| = \\frac{C_C}{C_{\\text{BL}} + C_C} \\frac{V_{\\text{DD}}}{2}$$\n\nThe sense amplifier requires a minimum voltage magnitude $|\\Delta V_{\\text{BL}}(t_{\\text{SA}})| \\ge \\Delta V_{\\text{th}}$ at the enable time $t_{\\text{SA}}$. This implies:\n$$|\\Delta V_{\\text{BL,}\\infty}| (1 - e^{-t_{\\text{SA}}/\\tau}) \\ge \\Delta V_{\\text{th}}$$\nFor a solution to exist for any finite time, the maximum possible voltage swing must be at least $\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}$. This leads to the physical feasibility condition:\n$$|\\Delta V_{\\text{BL,}\\infty}| \\ge \\Delta V_{\\text{th}}$$\nIf $|\\Delta V_{\\text{BL,}\\infty}| < \\Delta V_{\\text{th}}$, it is impossible to satisfy the condition, and the read will fail regardless of timing. If $|\\Delta V_{\\text{BL,}\\infty}| = \\Delta V_{\\text{th}}$, it would take infinite time to reach the threshold, so any finite $t_{\\text{SA}}$ is insufficient. Thus, for a successful read, we must have $|\\Delta V_{\\text{BL,}\\infty}| > \\Delta V_{\\text{th}}$.\n\nAssuming the feasibility condition holds, we can find the minimum required time, $t_{\\text{req}}$, by setting the inequality to an equality:\n$$|\\Delta V_{\\text{BL,}\\infty}| (1 - e^{-t_{\\text{req}}/\\tau}) = \\Delta V_{\\text{th}}$$\n$$1 - e^{-t_{\\text{req}}/\\tau} = \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}}{|\\Delta V_{\\text{BL,}\\infty}|}$$\n$$e^{-t_{\\text{req}}/\\tau} = 1 - \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}}{|\\Delta V_{\\text{BL,}\\infty}|}$$\n$$-t_{\\text{req}}/\\tau = \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}}{|\\Delta V_{\\text{BL,}\\infty}|}\\right)$$\n$$t_{\\text{req}} = -\\tau \\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}}{|\\Delta V_{\\text{BL,}\\infty}|}\\right) = \\tau \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}}{|\\Delta V_{\\text{BL,}\\infty}|}}\\right) = \\tau \\ln\\left(\\frac{|\\Delta V_{\\text{BL,}\\infty}|}{|\\Delta V_{\\text{BL,}\\infty}| - \\Delta V_{\\text{th}}}\\right)$$\nA given sense time $t_{\\text{SA}}$ is valid if and only if it is both physically feasible and $t_{\\text{SA}} \\ge t_{\\text{req}}$. This single check covers both aspects.\n\nThe algorithm for the program is as follows for each test case:\n1. Convert all input values to base SI units.\n2. Calculate the magnitude of the asymptotic bitline voltage swing: $|\\Delta V_{\\text{BL,}\\infty}| = \\frac{C_C}{C_C + C_{\\text{BL}}} \\frac{V_{\\text{DD}}}{2}$.\n3. Check for feasibility: If $|\\Delta V_{\\text{BL,}\\infty}| \\le \\Delta V_{\\text{th}}$, the read is not possible. The result is `False`.\n4. If feasible, calculate the time constant $\\tau = R_{\\text{on}} \\frac{C_C C_{\\text{BL}}}{C_C + C_{\\text{BL}}}$.\n5. Calculate the required minimum time $t_{\\text{req}} = \\tau \\ln\\left(\\frac{|\\Delta V_{\\text{BL,}\\infty}|}{|\\Delta V_{\\text{BL,}\\infty}| - \\Delta V_{\\text{th}}}\\right)$.\n6. Compare the given sense time to the required time. The result is `True` if $t_{\\text{SA}} \\ge t_{\\text{req}}$, and `False` otherwise.\nThis procedure is valid for both stored data states '$0$' and '$1$', as the voltage magnitude and timing are symmetric.",
