            "problem": "Consider a six-transistor Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM) cell implemented in a planar Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) technology. The cell comprises two cross-coupled inverters and two access transistors.

These widths must satisfy three primary conditions: a specific read current performance, a read static noise margin (SNM) constraint, and a total-width area constraint.\n\nFirst, we determine the key operating voltages and the required read current from the given constraints.\nThe supply voltage is $V_{DD} = 0.9\\,\\text{V}$.\nThe symmetric design target for the inverter switching threshold is $V_{M} = \\dfrac{V_{DD}}{2}$.\n$$V_{M} = \\frac{0.9\\,\\text{V}}{2} = 0.45\\,\\text{V}$$\nThe problem enforces the read-disturb constraint at its boundary: $V_{x} = V_{M} - V_{\\text{SNM}}$, where $V_x$ is the disturbed voltage on the zero-storing internal node and $V_{\\text{SNM}} = 0.18\\,\\text{V}$ is the required read SNM.\n$$V_{x} = 0.45\\,\\text{V} - 0.18\\,\\text{V} = 0.27\\,\\text{V}$$\nThe target average read current, $I_{\\text{read}}$, required to discharge the bitline capacitance $C_{BL} = 100\\,\\text{fF}$ by $\\Delta V_{BL} = 0.1\\,\\text{V}$ within the sensing time $t_{\\text{sense}} = 0.5\\,\\text{ns}$ is calculated as:\n$$I_{\\text{read}} = C_{BL} \\frac{\\Delta V_{BL}}{t_{\\text{sense}}} = (100 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\text{F}) \\frac{0.1\\,\\text{V}}{0.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\text{s}} = 20 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{A} = 20\\,\\mu\\text{A}$$\n\nNext, we determine the required sizing ratio of the inverter transistors to achieve the symmetric switching threshold $V_{M} = V_{DD}/2$.

The access and pull-down transistors are modeled in the read operation as linear conductances proportional to their widths, with a unit conductance-per-width of $g_{u} = 2$ mS per micrometer of effective width.

Formulation of Read Delay ($T$)**\n\nThe problem describes a read operation for a stored logical zero. The bitline (BL), precharged to $V_{DD}$, is discharged through the series combination of the access transistor (NMOS) and the pull-down transistor (NMOS). The problem states to model these transistors as linear conductances, $g_{ax}$ and $g_{pd}$, respectively.

Formulation of Read Energy ($E$)**\n\nFor a small-swing read operation followed by a precharge, the energy consumed per operation is dominated by the energy drawn from the supply $V_{DD}$ to restore the charge on the bitline capacitor $C_{BL}$. The charge removed is $Q = C_{BL} \\Delta V_{BL}$. The energy supplied to replenish this charge is $E = Q \\cdot V_{DD}$.\n$$E(\\Delta V_{BL}) = V_{DD} C_{BL} \\Delta V_{BL}$$\nThis is a standard and appropriate model for energy consumption in this context.\n\n**3. Formulation of the Energy–Delay Product (EDP)**\n\nThe energy-delay product is the product of $E$ and $T$:\n$$P_{ED}(\\beta, \\Delta V_{BL}) = \\left( V_{DD} C_{BL} \\Delta V_{BL} \\right) \\left( \\frac{C_{BL} (1+\\beta)^2}{\\beta g_u W_{\\mathrm{tot}}} \\ln\\left( \\frac{V_{DD}}{V_{DD}-\\Delta V_{BL}} \\right) \\right)$$\n$$P_{ED}(\\beta, \\Delta V_{BL}) = \\frac{V_{DD} C_{BL}^2}{g_u W_{\\mathrm{tot}}} \\left( \\frac{(1+\\beta)^2}{\\beta} \\right) \\left( \\Delta V_{BL} \\ln\\left( \\frac{V_{DD}}{V_{DD}-\\Delta V_{BL}} \\right) \\right)$$\nTo minimize $P_{ED}$, we can minimize the variable-dependent parts of the expression. Let $K = \\frac{V_{DD} C_{BL}^2}{g_u W_{\\mathrm{tot}}}$ be a constant. We need to minimize the function $f(\\beta, \\Delta V_{BL}) = f_1(\\beta) \\cdot f_2(\\Delta V_{BL})$, where:\n$$f_1(\\beta) = \\frac{(1+\\beta)^2}{\\beta} = \\beta + 2 + \\frac{1}{\\beta}$$\n$$f_2(\\Delta V_{BL}) = \\Delta V_{BL} \\ln\\left( \\frac{V_{DD}}{V_{DD}-\\Delta V_{BL}} \\right) = - \\Delta V_{BL} \\ln\\left( 1 - \\frac{\\Delta V_{BL}}{V_{DD}} \\right)$$\nSince $f_1(\\beta) > 0$ and $f_2(\\Delta V_{BL}) > 0$ in the feasible domain, minimizing the product is equivalent to minimizing each function independently over its respective constraint domain.\n\n**4. Analysis of Constraints**\n\nThe first constraint is on the static noise margin, $V_{SNM} \\geq V_{SNM,\\min}$.\n$V_{SNM} = V_{\\mathrm{trip}} - V_{\\mathrm{int}} = \\eta V_{DD} - \\frac{V_{DD}}{1+\\beta}$.\nThe constraint becomes:\n$$\\eta V_{DD} - \\frac{V_{DD}}{1+\\beta} \\geq V_{SNM,\\min}$$\nSubstituting the given values, $V_{DD} = 0.8 \\, \\mathrm{V}$, $\\eta = 0.48$, and $V_{SNM,\\min} = 0.15 \\, \\mathrm{V}$:\n$$0.48 \\times 0.8 - \\frac{0.8}{1+\\beta} \\geq 0.15$$\n$$0.384 - \\frac{0.8}{1+\\beta} \\geq 0.15$$\n$$0.234 \\geq \\frac{0.8}{1+\\beta}$$\nSince $1+\\beta > 0$, we can multiply:\n$$1+\\beta \\geq \\frac{0.8}{0.234}$$\n$$\\beta \\geq \\frac{0.8}{0.234} - 1 \\approx 3.418803 - 1 = 2.418803$$\nLet $\\beta_{\\min} = \\frac{0.8}{0.234} - 1$. The feasible domain for $\\beta$ is $[\\beta_{\\min}, \\infty)$.\n\nThe second constraint is on the bitline swing, $\\Delta V_{BL,\\min} \\leq \\Delta V_{BL} \\leq \\Delta V_{BL,\\max}$.\nWith the given values, $0.08 \\, \\mathrm{V} \\leq \\Delta V_{BL} \\leq 0.15 \\, \\mathrm{V}$.\n\n**5. Optimization**\n\nFirst, we optimize for $\\beta$. We analyze the function $f_1(\\beta) = \\beta + 2 + \\frac{1}{\\beta}$.\nIts derivative is $\\frac{df_1}{d\\beta} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\beta^2}$.\nThe derivative is zero at $\\beta=1$. For $\\beta > 1$, the derivative is positive, meaning $f_1(\\beta)$ is strictly increasing.\nThe feasible region for $\\beta$ is $[\\beta_{\\min}, \\infty)$, where $\\beta_{\\min} \\approx 2.4188$. Since this region lies entirely where $\\beta > 1$, the function $f_1(\\beta)$ is minimized at the smallest possible value of $\\beta$.\nTherefore, the optimal $\\beta$ is $\\beta^{\\star} = \\beta_{\\min}$.\n$$\\beta^{\\star} = \\frac{0.8}{0.234} - 1 \\approx 2.4188034$$\n\nNext, we optimize for $\\Delta V_{BL}$. We analyze the function $f_2(\\Delta V_{BL})$.\nLet $x = \\Delta V_{BL}$. The function is $f_2(x) = x \\ln\\left( \\frac{V_{DD}}{V_{DD}-x} \\right)$.\nIts derivative with respect to $x$ is:\n$$\\frac{df_2}{dx} = \\ln\\left( \\frac{V_{DD}}{V_{DD}-x} \\right) + x \\left( \\frac{V_{DD}-x}{V_{DD}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{V_{DD}}{(V_{DD}-x)^2} \\right) = \\ln\\left( \\frac{V_{DD}}{V_{DD}-x} \\right) + \\frac{x}{V_{DD}-x}$$\nLet $y = \\frac{x}{V_{DD}}$. The derivative can be written as $g(y) = -\\ln(1-y) + \\frac{y}{1-y}$.\nFor $y \\in (0,1)$, we can use the Taylor series expansion $\\ln(1-y) = -y - \\frac{y^2}{2} - \\dots$.\n$g(y) = (y + \\frac{y^2}{2} + \\dots) + y(1+y+y^2+\\dots) = (y+y+y^2+\\dots) + (\\frac{y^2}{2} + \\dots) > 0$.\nMore formally, let's analyze the derivative of $g(y)$:\n$g'(y) = \\frac{1}{1-y} + \\frac{1(1-y)-y(-1)}{(1-y)^2} = \\frac{1}{1-y} + \\frac{1}{(1-y)^2}$.\nFor $y<1$, $1-y>0$, so $g'(y)>0$. This means $g(y)$ is strictly increasing. Since $g(0) = 0$, for any $y>0$, $g(y)>0$.\nThe range of $\\Delta V_{BL}$ is $[0.08, 0.15]$, and $V_{DD}=0.8$.

            "problem": "You are asked to design and implement a program that, for a six-transistor Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM) cell, analyzes how process corners alter effective device strength ratios and identifies the worst-case process corner for read stability and write-ability. The objective is to compute, for each provided test case, which corner produces the smallest read margin and which produces the smallest write margin according to a simplified but principled model grounded in Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) square-law behavior. The problem is situated in the context of integrated circuits and Electronic Design Automation (EDA).\n\nFundamental base and model assumptions to be used:\n- Use the first-order MOSFET square-law current model for saturation, namely that the saturation current magnitude scales with the transconductance parameter $\\beta$, where $\\beta \\propto \\mu C_{\\mathrm{ox}} W/L$; here $\\mu$ is the carrier mobility, $C_{\\mathrm{ox}}$ is the oxide capacitance per unit area, and $W/L$ is the transistor geometry ratio. Since absolute current is not required, you may treat $C_{\\mathrm{ox}}$ as a constant and absorb it into $\\beta$ scaling.\n- Let the effective conduction “strength” for a device be approximated by $S = \\beta \\cdot \\max(V_{\\mathrm{eff}},0)^2$, where $V_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is the gate overdrive in saturation. For simplification at the supply voltage $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$, approximate the overdrives by $V_{\\mathrm{eff},n} = V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{tn}$ for an n-channel device and $V_{\\mathrm{eff},p} = V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - |V_{tp}|$ for a p-channel device.\n- The SRAM inverter pair trip point $V_M$ is to be computed under the square-law balance condition for the cross-coupled inverters by equating the saturated n-channel and p-channel currents. With $a = \\sqrt{\\beta_n}$ and $b = \\sqrt{\\beta_p}$, the switching threshold should be taken as\n$$\nV_M = \\frac{b\\,(V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - |V_{tp}|) + a\\, V_{tn}}{a + b}.\n$$\n- Define read disturb during a read access on the node storing a logical zero as a static divider between the access transistor pulling up from $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$ and the pull-down transistor pulling down to ground. Using the strength abstraction, approximate the disturbed node voltage as\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{read\\_rise}} = V_{\\mathrm{DD}} \\cdot \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{ax}}}{S_{\\mathrm{ax}} + S_{\\mathrm{pd}}},\n$$\nwhere $S_{\\mathrm{ax}}$ is the access transistor strength and $S_{\\mathrm{pd}}$ is the pull-down strength. Define the read margin proxy in volts as\n$$\nM_{\\mathrm{read}} = V_M - V_{\\mathrm{read\\_rise}}.\n$$\n- Define write-ability for writing a logical zero by the competition between the pull-up p-channel device (pulling up from $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$) and the access transistor (pulling down to ground). Using the same strength abstraction, approximate the quasi-static settle point as\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{write\\_settle}} = V_{\\mathrm{DD}} \\cdot \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{pu}}}{S_{\\mathrm{pu}} + S_{\\mathrm{ax}}},\n$$\nwhere $S_{\\mathrm{pu}}$ is the pull-up strength. Define the write margin proxy in volts as\n$$\nM_{\\mathrm{write}} = V_M - V_{\\mathrm{write\\_settle}}.\n$$\n- For the cross-coupled inverter strengths used to compute $V_M$, use the pull-down $\\beta_n$ of the memory cell n-channel and the pull-up $\\beta_p$ of the memory cell p-channel. For the access transistor strength, use its n-channel $\\beta_n$.\n\nProcess corners and parameter variation model:\n- Consider five process corners with independent mobility and threshold voltage variations for n-channel and p-channel devices:\n    - Typical–Typical (TT): $s_N = 1$, $s_P = 1$, $\\Delta V_{tn} = 0$, $\\Delta |V_{tp}| = 0$.\n    - Fast–Fast (FF): $s_N = 1 + \\alpha$, $s_P = 1 + \\alpha$, $\\Delta V_{tn} = -\\Delta V_t$, $\\Delta |V_{tp}| = -\\Delta V_t$.\n    - Slow–Slow (SS): $s_N = 1 - \\alpha$, $s_P = 1 - \\alpha$, $\\Delta V_{tn} = +\\Delta V_t$, $\\Delta |V_{tp}| = +\\Delta V_t$.\n    - Fast–N / Slow–P (FS): $s_N = 1 + \\alpha$, $s_P = 1 - \\alpha$, $\\Delta V_{tn} = -\\Delta V_t$, $\\Delta |V_{tp}| = +\\Delta V_t$.\n    - Slow–N / Fast–P (SF): $s_N = 1 - \\alpha$, $s_P = 1 + \\alpha$, $\\Delta V_{tn} = +\\Delta V_t$, $\\Delta |V_{tp}| = -\\Delta V_t$.\n- Here $s_N$ and $s_P$ scale the effective transconductance parameters $\\beta_n$ and $\\beta_p$ respectively via mobility changes, and the threshold variations are additive to the baseline magnitudes. Use fixed, globally applied numerical values $\\alpha = 0.25$ and $\\Delta V_t = 0.03$ in volts for all test cases.\n\nDevice strength formation:\n- The effective transconductance parameters for each device are given by\n$$\n\\beta_n = s_N \\cdot \\rho \\cdot \\frac{W}{L}, \\quad \\beta_p = s_P \\cdot \\frac{W}{L},\n$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the baseline mobility ratio $\\mu_n/\\mu_p$ provided per test case, and $W/L$ are the geometry ratios provided per device in each test case.\n\nAlgorithmic tasks to implement:\n- For each test case, and for each of the five corners, compute\n    - Effective thresholds: $V_{tn,\\mathrm{eff}} = V_{tn,0} + \\Delta V_{tn}$, $|V_{tp,\\mathrm{eff}}| = |V_{tp,0}| + \\Delta |V_{tp}|$, with the base magnitudes given in each test case.\n    - Inverter trip point $V_M$ using the $\\beta$ values of the pull-down n-channel and pull-up p-channel devices and the effective thresholds.\n    - Strengths $S_{\\mathrm{pd}}$, $S_{\\mathrm{ax}}$, and $S_{\\mathrm{pu}}$ using the strength model $S = \\beta \\cdot \\max(V_{\\mathrm{eff}},0)^2$ with the appropriate effective thresholds.\n    - Read margin proxy $M_{\\mathrm{read}}$ and write margin proxy $M_{\\mathrm{write}}$ in volts.\n- Identify, for each test case, the corner that minimizes $M_{\\mathrm{read}}$ (worst read stability) and the corner that minimizes $M_{\\mathrm{write}}$ (worst write-ability). In case of exact ties, choose the smallest corner index.\n\nCorner index mapping that must be used in the output:\n- TT $\\to 0$, FF $\\to 1$, SS $\\to 2$, FS $\\to 3$, SF $\\to 4$.\n\nUnits:\n- All voltages must be treated in volts. Geometry ratios $W/L$ and mobility ratio $\\rho$ are dimensionless.\n\nTest suite:\nEach test case is a tuple containing the parameters $(W/L)_{\\mathrm{pd}}$, $(W/L)_{\\mathrm{pu}}$, $(W/L)_{\\mathrm{ax}}$, $\\rho$, $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$, $V_{tn,0}$, $|V_{tp,0}|$, each of which is dimensionless except for voltages that are in volts. Use exactly the following four test cases:\n1. $\\left( 2.0, 1.0, 1.0, 2.5, 1.0, 0.35, 0.35 \\right)$.\n2. $\\left( 1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0, 0.8, 0.35, 0.35 \\right)$.\n3. $\\left( 3.0, 0.8, 1.0, 2.5, 1.0, 0.32, 0.34 \\right)$.\n4. $\\left( 2.0, 1.2, 1.2, 2.5, 0.6, 0.38, 0.42 \\right)$.\n\nOutput specification:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each element is a two-integer list $[i_{\\mathrm{read}}, i_{\\mathrm{write}}]$ corresponding to the identified worst-case corner indices for read and write respectively for each test case. For example, a valid output format is\n\"[ [0,4],[3,4],[2,2],[4,3] ]\"\nbut with the actual computed indices for the provided test suite.\n\nScientific realism and constraints:\n- The model must be implemented exactly as described and must not rely on any unmentioned empirical shortcuts. No user input is required; use the provided constants $\\alpha = 0.25$ and $\\Delta V_t = 0.03$ volts for all test cases and perform the computations deterministically as specified.",
            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of a six-transistor (6T) Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM) cell's read stability and write-ability under various manufacturing process corners. The analysis is to be performed using a simplified, first-order model based on the Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) square-law behavior. For each of the provided test cases, we must identify the process corner that results in the minimum read margin and the minimum write margin.\n\nThe methodology involves a systematic calculation for each test case across five defined process corners: Typical-Typical (TT), Fast-Fast (FF), Slow-Slow (SS), Fast-N/Slow-P (FS), and Slow-N/Fast-P (SF). The corner indices are mapped as follows: TT $\\to 0$, FF $\\to 1$, SS $\\to 2$, FS $\\to 3$, SF $\\to 4$.\n\nFor a given test case, specified by the parameters $((W/L)_{\\mathrm{pd}}, (W/L)_{\\mathrm{pu}}, (W/L)_{\\mathrm{ax}}, \\rho, V_{\\mathrm{DD}}, V_{tn,0}, |V_{tp,0}|)$, and for each process corner, the following sequence of calculations is performed.\n\nFirst, the process corner variations are applied. Each corner is defined by a set of scaling factors, $s_N$ for n-channel mobility and $s_P$ for p-channel mobility, and threshold voltage shifts, $\\Delta V_{tn}$ and $\\Delta |V_{tp}|$. The global variation parameters are given as $\\alpha = 0.25$ and $\\Delta V_t = 0.03$ V. For instance, the FS corner corresponds to $s_N = 1 + \\alpha$, $s_P = 1 - \\alpha$, $\\Delta V_{tn} = -\\Delta V_t$, and $\\Delta |V_{tp}| = +\\Delta V_t$.\n\nThe effective threshold voltages for the n-channel and p-channel MOSFETs are calculated by adding the variations to the baseline values:\n$$V_{tn,\\mathrm{eff}} = V_{tn,0} + \\Delta V_{tn}$$\n$$|V_{tp,\\mathrm{eff}}| = |V_{tp,0}| + \\Delta |V_{tp}|$$\n\nNext, the effective transconductance parameters ($\\beta$) for the three critical transistors—pull-down (pd), pull-up (pu), and access (ax)—are determined. These parameters scale with the mobility factor $s$ and the device geometry $W/L$. The n-channel devices also include the baseline mobility ratio $\\rho = \\mu_n/\\mu_p$.\n$$\\beta_{\\mathrm{pd}} = s_N \\cdot \\rho \\cdot (W/L)_{\\mathrm{pd}}$$\n$$\\beta_{\\mathrm{pu}} = s_P \\cdot (W/L)_{\\mathrm{pu}}$$\n$$\\beta_{\\mathrm{ax}} = s_N \\cdot \\rho \\cdot (W/L)_{\\mathrm{ax}}$$\n\nWith these parameters, we can determine the trip point, $V_M$, of the cross-coupled inverters that form the SRAM latch. This is the voltage at which the inverter switches, and it is found by equating the saturation currents of the pull-up p-channel and pull-down n-channel transistors. Using the provided formula with $a = \\sqrt{\\beta_{\\mathrm{pd}}}$ and $b = \\sqrt{\\beta_{\\mathrm{pu}}}$:\n$$V_M = \\frac{b\\,(V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - |V_{tp,\\mathrm{eff}}|) + a\\, V_{tn,\\mathrm{eff}}}{a + b}$$\n\nThe next step is to compute the effective \"strength\" of each transistor, which is a proxy for its current-driving capability. The strength $S$ is modeled as $S = \\beta \\cdot \\max(V_{\\mathrm{eff}}, 0)^2$. The gate overdrive voltage $V_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is approximated for a device whose gate is driven to a supply rail, which is the case during read and write operations. For an n-channel transistor with its gate at $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$, the overdrive is $V_{\\mathrm{eff},n} = V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{tn,\\mathrm{eff}}$. For a p-channel transistor with its gate at ground (and source at $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$), the overdrive is $V_{\\mathrm{eff},p} = V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - |V_{tp,\\mathrm{eff}}|$. The strengths for the pull-down, pull-up, and access transistors are thus:\n$$S_{\\mathrm{pd}} = \\beta_{\\mathrm{pd}} \\cdot \\max(0, V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{tn,\\mathrm{eff}})^2$$\n$$S_{\\mathrm{pu}} = \\beta_{\\mathrm{pu}} \\cdot \\max(0, V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - |V_{tp,\\mathrm{eff}}|)^2$$\n$$S_{\\mathrm{ax}} = \\beta_{\\mathrm{ax}} \\cdot \\max(0, V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{tn,\\mathrm{eff}})^2$$\n\nNow, we evaluate the two key metrics: read margin and write margin.\n\nThe read margin, $M_{\\mathrm{read}}$, is a measure of the cell's stability during a read operation. When reading a stored '0', the access transistor and the pull-down transistor form a voltage divider that can cause the voltage on the storage node to rise. This voltage rise, $V_{\\mathrm{read\\_rise}}$, must not exceed the inverter's trip point $V_M$, otherwise the cell may flip. The voltage rise is modeled as:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{read\\_rise}} = V_{\\mathrm{DD}} \\cdot \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{ax}}}{S_{\\mathrm{ax}} + S_{\\mathrm{pd}}}$$\nThe read margin is then the difference:\n$$M_{\\mathrm{read}} = V_M - V_{\\mathrm{read\\_rise}}$$\nA smaller, or negative, $M_{\\mathrm{read}}$ indicates worse read stability.\n\nThe write margin, $M_{\\mathrm{write}}$, assesses the cell's write-ability. When writing a '0' into a cell storing a '1', the access transistor must overcome the pull-up transistor to pull the storage node voltage below the inverter's trip point. The quasi-static voltage to which the node settles in this contention is modeled as:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{write\\_settle}} = V_{\\mathrm{DD}} \\cdot \\frac{S_{\\mathrm{pu}}}{S_{\\mathrm{pu}} + S_{\\mathrm{ax}}}$$\nThe write margin is defined as:\n$$M_{\\mathrm{write}} = V_M - V_{\\mathrm{write\\_settle}}$$\nA smaller, or negative, $M_{\\mathrm{write}}$ indicates a more difficult or failed write operation.\n\nBy executing these calculations for all five process corners for a single test case, we obtain five values for $M_{\\mathrm{read}}$ and five for $M_{\\mathrm{write}}$. We then identify the corner index corresponding to the minimum value in each set. In case of a tie, the problem specifies selecting the smallest corner index. This procedure is repeated for all four test cases. The final output aggregates these worst-case corner indices into the specified list format.",
