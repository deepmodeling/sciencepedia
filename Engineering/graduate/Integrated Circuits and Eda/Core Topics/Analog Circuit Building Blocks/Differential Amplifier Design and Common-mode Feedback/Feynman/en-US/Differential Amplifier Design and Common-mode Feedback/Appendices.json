The problem is well-posed and objective, conforming to the principles of MOSFET device physics and analog circuit theory. We may therefore proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe starting point is the standard square-law model for an $n$-channel MOSFET operating in the saturation region. The problem specifies to neglect channel-length modulation and the body effect. Under these simplifying assumptions, the drain current $I_D$ is given by:\n$$I_{D} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} (V_{GS} - V_{TH})^2$$\nwhere $\\mu_{n}$ is the electron mobility, $C_{ox}$ is the gate oxide capacitance per unit area, $W$ and $L$ are the channel width and length, respectively, $V_{GS}$ is the gate-to-source voltage, and $V_{TH}$ is the constant threshold voltage.\n\nThe small-signal transconductance, $g_m$, is defined as the partial derivative of the drain current $I_D$ with respect to the gate-to-source voltage $V_{GS}$, evaluated at the DC operating point.\n$$g_{m} = \\frac{\\partial I_{D}}{\\partial V_{GS}}$$\nTo find $g_m$, we differentiate the expression for $I_D$ with respect to $V_{GS}$, treating all other parameters ($\\mu_{n}$, $C_{ox}$, $W$, $L$, $V_{TH}$) as constants:\n$$g_{m} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_{GS}} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} (V_{GS} - V_{TH})^2 \\right]$$\nApplying the chain rule for differentiation, we obtain:\n$$g_{m} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} \\cdot 2 (V_{GS} - V_{TH}) \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_{GS}}(V_{GS} - V_{TH})$$\n$$g_{m} = \\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} (V_{GS} - V_{TH})$$\nThis expression gives $g_m$ in terms of the overdrive voltage, $(V_{GS} - V_{TH})$. The problem requires an expression in terms of the drain current and device parameters. To achieve this, we first rearrange the saturation current equation to solve for the overdrive voltage:\n$$(V_{GS} - V_{TH})^2 = \\frac{2 I_{D}}{\\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L}}$$\nTaking the square root of both sides (the overdrive voltage is positive for an active device) yields:\n$$V_{GS} - V_{TH} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 I_{D}}{\\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L}}}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $(V_{GS} - V_{TH})$ back into our equation for $g_m$:\n$$g_{m} = \\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{2 I_{D}}{\\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L}}} \\right)$$\nTo simplify, we can bring the term $\\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L}$ inside the square root by squaring it:\n$$g_{m} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{2 I_{D}}{\\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L}}\\right)}$$\n$$g_{m} = \\sqrt{2 I_{D} \\left(\\mu_{n} C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L}\\right)}$$\nThis is the transconductance expressed in terms of the branch current $I_D$ and the process/geometry parameters. This is a general result for a MOSFET in saturation under the given assumptions.\n\nThe final step is to relate this to the tail current $I_{tail}$ of the differential pair. The problem states that the amplifier is a symmetric long-tailed pair and that a common-mode feedback (CMFB) loop enforces a constant tail current $I_{tail}$. Under zero differential input, this tail current is split equally between the two identical MOSFETs.

            "solution": "The problem is evaluated to be valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It relies on standard and well-established principles of analog integrated circuit design, namely the square-law model for MOSFETs and Pelgrom's model for statistical mismatch. All necessary parameters and assumptions are provided, allowing for the derivation of a unique and meaningful solution.\n\nThe problem asks for two main deliverables: first, a quantitative derivation and calculation of the input-referred offset voltage due to threshold-voltage mismatch, and second, a qualitative discussion of layout techniques for offset mitigation.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation and Calculation of Input-Referred Offset Voltage**\n\nThe input stage is a matched MOSFET differential pair ($M_1$, $M_2$) operating in the saturation region. The drain current $I_D$ for a long-channel MOSFET in saturation is described by the square-law model:\n$$I_D = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} (V_{GS} - V_t)^2$$\nwhere $\\mu_n C_{ox}$ is the process transconductance parameter, $W$ is the gate width, $L$ is the gate length, $V_{GS}$ is the gate-to-source voltage, and $V_t$ is the threshold voltage. For the two transistors in the differential pair, we have:\n$$I_{D1} = \\frac{1}{2} (\\mu_n C_{ox})_1 \\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)_1 (V_{GS1} - V_{t1})^2$$\n$$I_{D2} = \\frac{1}{2} (\\mu_n C_{ox})_2 \\left(\\frac{W}{L}\\right)_2 (V_{GS2} - V_{t2})^2$$\n\nThe problem states the pair is matched, so we can assume ideal matching for all parameters except for the threshold voltage $V_t$, as specified. Thus, $(\\mu_n C_{ox})_1 = (\\mu_n C_{ox})_2$ and $(W/L)_1 = (W/L)_2$.\n\nThe input-referred offset voltage, $V_{OS}$, is defined as the differential input voltage, $V_{id} = V_{in+} - V_{in-}$, required to balance the differential pair, which means the drain currents must be equal: $I_{D1} = I_{D2}$. The input voltages are applied to the gates, $V_{G1} = V_{in+}$ and $V_{G2} = V_{in-}$, and the sources are tied together, $V_{S1} = V_{S2}$. Therefore, $V_{GS1} - V_{GS2} = V_{G1} - V_{G2} = V_{id}$.\n\nSetting $I_{D1}=I_{D2}$ gives:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} (V_{GS1} - V_{t1})^2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} (V_{GS2} - V_{t2})^2$$\n$$(V_{GS1} - V_{t1})^2 = (V_{GS2} - V_{t2})^2$$\nSince the transistors are in strong inversion and saturation, their overdrive voltages $(V_{GS} - V_t)$ are positive. We can take the positive square root of both sides:\n$$V_{GS1} - V_{t1} = V_{GS2} - V_{t2}$$\nRearranging the terms, we find the input voltage difference required for balanced currents:\n$$V_{GS1} - V_{GS2} = V_{t1} - V_{t2}$$\nThe input-referred offset voltage is thus the difference between the threshold voltages:\n$$V_{OS} = V_{id}|_{I_{D1}=I_{D2}} = V_{t1} - V_{t2} = \\Delta V_t$$\n\nThe mismatch in threshold voltage is a random variable. The problem states it follows Pelgrom's model, which relates the standard deviation of the mismatch, $\\sigma(\\Delta V_t)$, to the device area $A = W \\cdot L$ and a process-specific parameter $A_{V_t}$:\n$$\\sigma(\\Delta V_t) = \\frac{A_{V_t}}{\\sqrt{W \\cdot L}}$$\nSince $V_{OS} = \\Delta V_t$, the standard deviation of the input-referred offset voltage, $\\sigma(V_{OS})$, is equal to the standard deviation of the threshold voltage mismatch:\n$$\\sigma(V_{OS}) = \\sigma(\\Delta V_t) = \\frac{A_{V_t}}{\\sqrt{W \\cdot L}}$$\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- Width $W = 16\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n- Length $L = 0.24\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n- Pelgrom's parameter $A_{V_t} = 3.0\\,\\mathrm{mV}\\cdot\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the area of the transistor gate:\n$$A = W \\cdot L = (16\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}) \\cdot (0.24\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}) = 3.84\\,(\\mu\\mathrm{m})^2$$\nNext, we substitute the values into the equation for the standard deviation of the offset:\n$$\\sigma(V_{OS}) = \\frac{3.0\\,\\mathrm{mV}\\cdot\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{\\sqrt{3.84\\,(\\mu\\mathrm{m})^2}} = \\frac{3.0}{\\sqrt{3.84}}\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\\sqrt{3.84} \\approx 1.95959179$$\n$$\\sigma(V_{OS}) \\approx \\frac{3.0}{1.95959179}\\,\\mathrm{mV} \\approx 1.5309347\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, we obtain:\n$$\\sigma(V_{OS}) \\approx 1.531\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\n\n**Part 2: Common-Centroid Layout Strategies**\n\nThe calculated offset is due to purely random local mismatch. In a real integrated circuit, device parameter variations have two components: a systematic component (e.g., a smooth gradient across the die) and a random component (local stochastic fluctuations). Common-centroid layout is a powerful technique to mitigate both effects. Appropriate strategies include interdigitation and cross-coupling.\n\nJustification:\n1.  **Mitigation of Systematic Gradients**: Process parameters such as oxide thickness, implantation doses, and film stresses often exhibit smooth, low-order spatial gradients across the silicon die. If two \"matched\" transistors are simply placed side-by-side, one will systematically have, for example, a higher threshold voltage than the other due to the gradient, leading to a large, predictable offset. A common-centroid layout arranges the matched devices (often by splitting them into smaller segments) such that their geometric centroids coincide. For any linear gradient, the average value of a parameter over the device area is equal to the value at the centroid. By forcing the centroids to be the same, the first-order effects of these gradients are cancelled, ensuring that both composite devices experience the same average parameter values. A common example is the quad or cross-coupled structure, where a pair of devices ($M_1, M_2$) are each split in two ($M_{1A}, M_{1B}$ and $M_{2A}, M_{2B}$) and placed in a $2 \\times 2$ matrix, e.g., $M_{1A}$ and $M_{1B}$ on one diagonal and $M_{2A}$ and $M_{2B}$ on the other.\n\n2.  **Reduction of Random Mismatch Effects**: Pelgrom's law describes random mismatch, which is not cancelled by averaging in the same way as a deterministic gradient. However, its effect can be reduced. Random parameter fluctuations can be modeled as a spatial random field. By using common-centroid techniques like interdigitation (e.g., laying out fingers as $M_1, M_2, M_1, M_2, \\dots$) or cross-coupling, the segments of the two matched transistors are forced to sample the same local neighborhood of this random field. This increases the spatial correlation between the random variations of the two devices' parameters. The variance of the difference between two correlated random variables $V_{t1}$ and $V_{t2}$ is given by $\\mathrm{Var}(V_{t1} - V_{t2}) = \\mathrm{Var}(V_{t1}) + \\mathrm{Var}(V_{t2}) - 2 \\mathrm{Cov}(V_{t1}, V_{t2})$. By increasing the covariance term $\\mathrm{Cov}(V_{t1}, V_{t2})$, the variance of the difference is reduced. Therefore, common-centroid layouts minimize the effective random mismatch, leading to a lower input-referred offset in practice. This is sometimes referred to as an \"averaging\" effect, but it is more accurately described as an increase in correlation.",

This involves modeling the closed-loop behavior of both the differential signal path and the common-mode feedback (CMFB) loop as first-order systems, deriving their respective time constants, and then determining the settling times.\n\nFirst, we analyze the differential-mode path. The Fully Differential Operational Transconductance Amplifier (FD-OTA) is configured as a unity-gain differential buffer, which implies the feedback factor for the differential signal, $\\beta_{\\text{dm}}$, is equal to $1$. The problem states that the differential small-signal response is well-approximated by a dominant-pole system.

The closed-loop pole is located at $\\omega_{\\text{cl,dm}} = \\omega_{p,\\text{dm}}(1+A_{\\text{dm0}})$. For a typical high-gain amplifier, $A_{\\text{dm0}} \\gg 1$, so $1+A_{\\text{dm0}} \\approx A_{\\text{dm0}}$. The closed-loop pole frequency becomes $\\omega_{\\text{cl,dm}} \\approx \\omega_{p,\\text{dm}}A_{\\text{dm0}}$. This product is a fundamental parameter of the amplifier: the gain-bandwidth product ($GBW$). The problem provides $\\text{GBW}_{\\text{dm}} = 200\\,\\text{MHz}$. In radians per second, this is $\\omega_{\\text{GBW,dm}} = 2\\pi \\cdot \\text{GBW}_{\\text{dm}}$.\nThus, the closed-loop pole is $\\omega_{\\text{cl,dm}} = 2\\pi \\cdot \\text{GBW}_{\\text{dm}}$.\nThe dominant closed-loop time constant for the differential path, $\\tau_{\\text{dm}}$, is the reciprocal of this pole frequency:\n$$\\tau_{\\text{dm}} = \\frac{1}{\\omega_{\\text{cl,dm}}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi \\cdot \\text{GBW}_{\\text{dm}}}$$\n\nNext, we analyze the common-mode feedback path.
