            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of digital circuit design, specifically CMOS dynamic power consumption. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions, variables, and numerical values to derive a unique solution. The language is objective and the parameters are physically realistic.\n\nThe first step is to derive the expression for dynamic power, $P$, from the fundamental principles provided.\nDynamic power in a CMOS circuit is the power consumed due to the charging and discharging of load capacitances during logic state transitions. Let us consider a single $0 \\rightarrow 1$ transition at the output of a CMOS gate. This transition requires charging the effective load capacitance, $C_{\\text{eff}}$, from a voltage of $0$ to the supply voltage, $V$.\n\nThe total charge, $Q$, that must be transferred from the power supply to the capacitor to achieve this is given by $Q = C_{\\text{eff}} V$.\nThe energy, $E_{\\text{supply}}$, drawn from the constant voltage supply $V$ to deliver this charge is $E_{\\text{supply}} = V Q = V(C_{\\text{eff}} V) = C_{\\text{eff}} V^2$.\nIt is a fundamental result of circuit theory that during this charging process through the resistive PMOS network, half of the energy drawn from the supply is stored in the capacitor, and the other half is dissipated as heat in the transistors. The energy stored in the capacitor is indeed $E_{\\text{cap}} = \\frac{1}{2} C_{\\text{eff}} V^2$, as stated in the problem's premises. During the subsequent $1 \\rightarrow 0$ transition, this stored energy is dissipated as heat through the NMOS network as the capacitor discharges to ground. No energy is drawn from the supply during discharge.\nTherefore, the total energy consumed from the power supply for one full switching event (a $0 \\rightarrow 1$ transition followed by a $1 \\rightarrow 0$ transition) is exclusively the energy drawn during the charging phase, which is $E_{\\text{cycle}} = C_{\\text{eff}} V^2$.\n\nThe problem defines the switching activity factor, $\\alpha$, as the expected number of $0 \\rightarrow 1$ transitions per clock cycle. The clock frequency, $f$, is the number of clock cycles per second.\nThe rate of charging events (the number of $0 \\rightarrow 1$ transitions per second) is the product of these two quantities:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of charging} = \\alpha f\n$$\nDynamic power, $P$, is the rate of energy consumption.

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe dynamic power consumption in a CMOS circuit is dominated by the energy required to charge and discharge parasitic and load capacitances. The problem asks us to consider only the power associated with charging the input capacitance of the flip-flop clock pins.\n\nThe energy dissipated from the power supply during a single charging event (a $0 \\rightarrow V$ transition) of a capacitance $C$ is given as $E = C V^{2}$. Power is the rate of energy consumption, so $P = E/T$, where $T$ is the time interval over which this energy is averaged.\n\nFirst, we determine the total ungated sink dynamic power, $P_{\\text{ungated}}$.\nThe total capacitance being switched in the entire block is the sum of the individual flip-flop clock pin capacitances:\n$$ C_{\\text{total}} = N \\cdot C_{\\text{clk,eff}} $$\nIn the ungated case ($g=0$), each flip-flop's clock input experiences one $0 \\rightarrow 1$ transition per clock cycle. The clock frequency is $f$, so the number of transitions per second is $f$. The total energy dissipated per second (which is power) for all flip-flops is:\n$$ P_{\\text{ungated}} = N \\cdot (\\text{Energy per FF per transition}) \\cdot (\\text{Transitions per second}) $$\nThe energy per FF per transition is $C_{\\text{clk,eff}} V^{2}$. The number of transitions per second is $f$.\nTherefore, the total ungated dynamic power is:\n$$ P_{\\text{ungated}} = N \\cdot C_{\\text{clk,eff}} \\cdot V^{2} \\cdot f $$\nNext, we introduce clock gating with an efficiency $g$. The gating efficiency $g$ is defined as the fraction of cycles where the clock transition is suppressed. This reduces the average number of $0 \\rightarrow 1$ transitions per cycle from $1$ to $(1-g)$. The activity factor, which is the average number of charging transitions per clock cycle, is thus reduced to $\\alpha = (1-g)$.\nThe dynamic power with clock gating, $P_{\\text{gated}}$, is then:\n$$ P_{\\text{gated}} = (1-g) \\cdot N \\cdot C_{\\text{clk,eff}} \\cdot V^{2} \\cdot f $$\nThis can be expressed in terms of the ungated power:\n$$ P_{\\text{gated}} = (1-g) \\cdot P_{\\text{ungated}} $$\nThe power reduction attributable to clock gating, $\\Delta P_{\\text{gating}}$, is the difference between the ungated and gated power:\n$$ \\Delta P_{\\text{gating}} = P_{\\text{ungated}} - P_{\\text{gated}} $$\n$$ \\Delta P_{\\text{gating}} = P_{\\text{ungated}} - (1-g) \\cdot P_{\\text{ungated}} $$\n$$ \\Delta P_{\\text{gating}} = (1 - (1-g)) \\cdot P_{\\text{ungated}} = g \\cdot P_{\\text{ungated}} $$\nThis result is intuitive: the power saving is the fraction of suppressed clock cycles multiplied by the original power.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n- $N = 5.0 \\times 10^{4}$\n- $C_{\\text{clk,eff}} = 6\\,\\mathrm{fF} = 6 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{F}$\n- $V = 0.7\\,\\mathrm{V}$\n- $f = 800\\,\\mathrm{MHz} = 800 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{Hz} = 8 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $g = 0.60$\n\nFirst, we calculate $P_{\\text{ungated}}$:\n$$ P_{\\text{ungated}} = (5.0 \\times 10^{4}) \\cdot (6 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{F}) \\cdot (0.7\\,\\mathrm{V})^{2} \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) $$\n$$ P_{\\text{ungated}} = (5.0 \\times 10^{4}) \\cdot (6 \\times 10^{-15}) \\cdot (0.49) \\cdot (8 \\times 10^{8}) \\, \\mathrm{W} $$\n$$ P_{\\text{ungated}} = (5.0 \\cdot 6 \\cdot 0.49 \\cdot 8) \\times 10^{4 - 15 + 8} \\, \\mathrm{W} $$\n$$ P_{\\text{ungated}} = 117.6 \\times 10^{-3} \\, \\mathrm{W} $$\nThe problem requires the answer in milliwatts ($\\mathrm{mW}$), where $1\\,\\mathrm{mW} = 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{W}$.\n$$ P_{\\text{ungated}} = 117.6 \\, \\mathrm{mW} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the value is $117.6\\,\\mathrm{mW}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the power reduction, $\\Delta P_{\\text{gating}}$:\n$$ \\Delta P_{\\text{gating}} = g \\cdot P_{\\text{ungated}} $$\n$$ \\Delta P_{\\text{gating}} = 0.60 \\cdot 117.6 \\, \\mathrm{mW} $$\n$$ \\Delta P_{\\text{gating}} = 70.56 \\, \\mathrm{mW} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, the value is $70.56\\,\\mathrm{mW}$.\n\nThe two requested values are the total ungated sink dynamic power ($117.6\\,\\mathrm{mW}$) and the power reduction due to gating ($70.56\\,\\mathrm{mW}$).",

This occurs at $t_{A,\\text{cross}}$.\n$$\nt_{\\text{out,rise}} = t_{A,\\text{cross}} + t_{\\mathrm{pd,r}} = t_{rA} \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{T}}}{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}} + t_{\\mathrm{pd,r}}\n$$\n\nThe output begins to fall at a time $t_{\\text{out,fall}}$, which is $t_{\\mathrm{pd,f}}$ after the condition $A(t)>V_{\\mathrm{T}} \\text{ and } B(t)>V_{\\mathrm{T}}$ is no longer met. This occurs at $t_{B,\\text{cross}}$.\n$$\nt_{\\text{out,fall}} = t_{B,\\text{cross}} + t_{\\mathrm{pd,f}} = \\left( \\Delta + t_{fB}\\left(1 - \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{T}}}{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}\\right) \\right) + t_{\\mathrm{pd,f}}\n$$\n\nThe width of the output high pulse, $W_{\\text{pulse}}$, is the time difference between the falling edge and the rising edge of the output signal.\n$$\nW_{\\text{pulse}} = t_{\\text{out,fall}} - t_{\\text{out,rise}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $t_{\\text{out,fall}}$ and $t_{\\text{out,rise}}$:\n$$\nW_{\\text{pulse}} = \\left[ \\Delta + t_{fB}\\left(1 - \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{T}}}{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}}\\right) + t_{\\mathrm{pd,f}} \\right] - \\left[ t_{rA} \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{T}}}{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}} + t_{\\mathrm{pd,r}} \\right]\n$$\nRearranging the terms gives the closed-form expression for the output pulse width:\n$$\nW_{\\text{pulse}} = \\Delta + t_{fB} - (t_{rA} + t_{fB})\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{T}}}{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}} + t_{\\mathrm{pd,f}} - t_{\\mathrm{pd,r}}\n$$\n\n### Part 3: Numerical Computation\n\nWe are given the following parameters:\n- $V_{\\mathrm{DD}} = 0.8$\n- $V_{\\mathrm{T}} = 0.4$\n- $t_{rA} = 20\\,\\mathrm{ps}$\n- $t_{fB} = 30\\,\\mathrm{ps}$\n- $\\Delta = 5\\,\\mathrm{ps}$\n- $t_{\\mathrm{pd,r}} = 12\\,\\mathrm{ps}$\n- $t_{\\mathrm{pd,f}} = 9\\,\\mathrm{ps}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the threshold ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{T}}}{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}} = \\frac{0.4}{0.8} = 0.5\n$$\n\nNow, we can use the derived formula for $W_{\\text{pulse}}$ to compute its value.\n$$\nW_{\\text{pulse}} = \\Delta + t_{fB} - (t_{rA} + t_{fB})\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{T}}}{V_{\\mathrm{DD}}} + t_{\\mathrm{pd,f}} - t_{\\mathrm{pd,r}}\n$$\nSubstitute the numerical values (timings in picoseconds):\n$$\nW_{\\text{pulse}} = 5 + 30 - (20 + 30)(0.5) + 9 - 12\n$$\n$$\nW_{\\text{pulse}} = 35 - (50)(0.5) - 3\n$$\n$$\nW_{\\text{pulse}} = 35 - 25 - 3\n$$\n$$\nW_{\\text{pulse}} = 10 - 3\n$$\n$$\nW_{\\text{pulse}} = 7\\,\\mathrm{ps}\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for the result to be rounded to four significant figures. The exact answer is $7$. To express this with four significant figures, we write $7.000$.\n\nThe width of the high pulse at the output is $7.000\\,\\mathrm{ps}$.\nLet's verify the condition from Part 1 is met with these parameters:\n$t_{A,\\text{cross}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{ps} \\times 0.5 = 10\\,\\mathrm{ps}$\n$t_{B,\\text{cross}} = 5\\,\\mathrm{ps} + 30\\,\\mathrm{ps} \\times (1 - 0.5) = 5\\,\\mathrm{ps} + 15\\,\\mathrm{ps} = 20\\,\\mathrm{ps}$\nSince $10\\,\\mathrm{ps} < 20\\,\\mathrm{ps}$, the condition $t_{A,\\text{cross}} < t_{B,\\text{cross}}$ holds, and a pulse is indeed generated.\nThe resulting pulse width calculation is correct.",
