            "problem": "A gate-driven Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) clamp is used in Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) protection to shunt surge current and limit pad voltage during an ESD event. Consider an $n$-channel MOSFET operating in strong inversion and the linear (ohmic) region during the clamp action, with drain-to-source voltage $V_{ds}$ sufficiently small compared to the gate overdrive $V_{ov} = V_{gs} - V_{th}$. Assume drift-diffusion transport, the charge-sheet approximation, and neglect velocity saturation, channel-length modulation, Drain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL), and source/drain series resistance. The channel current for small $V_{ds}$ can be modeled by the leading-order term arising from mobile charge density and drift velocity, where the mobile inversion charge per unit area is proportional to the oxide capacitance per unit area times the overdrive voltage.

A unique, stable, and meaningful solution exists.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, formal, and unbiased technical language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe drain current $I_d$ in a MOSFET is due to the drift of mobile charge carriers in the inversion layer under the influence of the lateral electric field. The current can be expressed as the product of the channel width $W$, the mobile inversion charge per unit area $|Q_n(y)|$, and the electron drift velocity $v_d(y)$, where $y$ is the position along the channel from the source ($y=0$) to the drain ($y=L$).\n$$ I_d = W |Q_n(y)| v_d(y) $$\nWithin the gradual channel and charge-sheet approximations, the mobile charge per unit area at a position $y$ with channel potential $V(y)$ is given by:\n$$ |Q_n(y)| = C_{ox} (V_{gs} - V_{th} - V(y)) = C_{ox} (V_{ov} - V(y)) $$\nwhere $C_{ox}$ is the gate oxide capacitance per unit area, $V_{gs}$ is the gate-to-source voltage, and $V_{th}$ is the threshold voltage. The drift velocity is proportional to the local electric field $E(y)$:\n$$ v_d(y) = \\mu_n E(y) = \\mu_n \\frac{dV(y)}{dy} $$\nwhere $\\mu_n$ is the electron mobility.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the current equation gives:\n$$ I_d = W \\mu_n C_{ox} (V_{ov} - V(y)) \\frac{dV(y)}{dy} $$\nTo find the total current, we integrate this expression along the length of the channel, from $y=0$ (where $V(0)=0$) to $y=L$ (where $V(L)=V_{ds}$).\n$$ I_d \\int_0^L dy = W \\mu_n C_{ox} \\int_0^{V_{ds}} (V_{ov} - V) dV $$\nEvaluating the integrals yields the general current-voltage relationship for the MOSFET:\n$$ I_d L = W \\mu_n C_{ox} \\left[ V_{ov}V - \\frac{V^2}{2} \\right]_0^{V_{ds}} $$\n$$ I_d = \\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} \\left( V_{ov}V_{ds} - \\frac{V_{ds}^2}{2} \\right) $$\nThe problem specifies that the device operates in the linear region with a small $V_{ds}$ compared to $V_{ov}$. In this regime, the quadratic term $V_{ds}^2/2$ is negligible compared to the linear term $V_{ov}V_{ds}$. The current-voltage relationship simplifies to:\n$$ I_d \\approx \\left( \\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} V_{ov} \\right) V_{ds} $$\nThe on-resistance $R_{on}$ is defined as the ratio $V_{ds}/I_d$ in this small-$V_{ds}$ limit. From the simplified expression above, we derive the formula for $R_{on}$:\n$$ R_{on} = \\frac{V_{ds}}{I_d} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} V_{ov}} $$\nThis is the required expression for the on-resistance.\n\nNow, we use this expression to solve for the required width scaling ratio $W/W_0$. Let the initial device have width $W_0$ and on-resistance $R_{on,0}$, and the new device have width $W$ and on-resistance $R_{on}$. The parameters $\\mu_n$, $C_{ox}$, $L$, and $V_{ov}$ are the same for both devices.\nThe on-resistance for the initial device is:\n$$ R_{on,0} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W_0}{L} V_{ov}} $$\nThe on-resistance for the new device is:\n$$ R_{on} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} V_{ov}} $$\nTo find the relationship between the widths and resistances, we can take the ratio of the two expressions:\n$$ \\frac{R_{on,0}}{R_{on}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W_0}{L} V_{ov}}}{\\frac{1}{\\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} V_{ov}}} = \\frac{W}{W_0} $$\nThus, the required width scaling ratio is equal to the ratio of the initial on-resistance to the target on-resistance:\n$$ \\frac{W}{W_0} = \\frac{R_{on,0}}{R_{on}} $$\nWe are given the target resistance $R_{on} = 1\\ \\Omega$. We must first calculate the initial resistance $R_{on,0}$. The problem provides the combined parameter $\\mu_n C_{ox} (W_0/L) = 1\\ \\mathrm{mA/V} = 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{A/V}$ and $V_{ov} = 3\\ \\mathrm{V}$.\n$$ R_{on,0} = \\frac{1}{\\left(\\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W_0}{L}\\right) V_{ov}} = \\frac{1}{(10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{A/V}) \\cdot (3\\ \\mathrm{V})} = \\frac{1}{3 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{A}} = \\frac{1000}{3}\\ \\Omega $$\nNow we can compute the width scaling ratio:\n$$ \\frac{W}{W_0} = \\frac{R_{on,0}}{R_{on}} = \\frac{\\frac{1000}{3}\\ \\Omega}{1\\ \\Omega} = \\frac{1000}{3} $$\nThis is the required dimensionless ratio of the new width to the original width.",

It is a standard circuit analysis problem grounded in the principles of electronics and ESD protection design.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe problem asks for the condition on the clamp voltage $V_{\\mathrm{clamp}}$ to ensure the pad voltage $V_{\\mathrm{pad}}$ remains below a safe level $V_{\\mathrm{safe}}$ during a positive HBM event. We will model the specified current path and apply fundamental circuit laws.\n\nLet the ground rail potential be the reference potential, so $V_{\\mathrm{SS}} = 0\\ \\mathrm{V}$. The pad voltage, $V_{\\mathrm{pad}}$, and the positive supply rail voltage, $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$, are measured with respect to this ground reference.\n\nAccording to the problem description:\n1. A peak current of $I_{\\mathrm{HBM}} = 2\\ \\mathrm{A}$ is injected into the I/O pad.\n2. During this positive discharge, the current is steered from the pad, through the forward-biased diode connected to the positive supply rail $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$. This diode is modeled as a resistor with on-resistance $R_{\\mathrm{on}} = 1\\ \\Omega$.\n3. The rail clamp maintains the potential difference between the positive and ground rails at a fixed value, $V_{\\mathrm{clamp}}$. Since $V_{\\mathrm{SS}} = 0\\ \\mathrm{V}$, the voltage of the positive supply rail is fixed at $V_{\\mathrm{DD}} = V_{\\mathrm{clamp}}$.\n\nWe can construct a simple circuit model for the peak of the discharge event. The current $I_{\\mathrm{HBM}}$ flows from the pad node (at potential $V_{\\mathrm{pad}}$) through the resistor $R_{\\mathrm{on}}$ to the $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$ node (at potential $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$). The voltage drop across this resistor is governed by Ohm's Law. For current to flow from the pad to the $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$ rail, the potential of the pad must be higher than the potential of the $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$ rail. Thus, we can write:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{pad}} - V_{\\mathrm{DD}} = I_{\\mathrm{HBM}} R_{\\mathrm{on}}$$\nThis is an application of Kirchhoff's Voltage Law along the discharge path.\n\nWe are given that the rail clamp sets the voltage of the positive supply rail to $V_{\\mathrm{clamp}}$ above ground. Therefore:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{DD}} = V_{\\mathrm{clamp}}$$\nSubstituting this into our previous equation gives:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{pad}} - V_{\\mathrm{clamp}} = I_{\\mathrm{HBM}} R_{\\mathrm{on}}$$\nWe can solve for the pad voltage, $V_{\\mathrm{pad}}$, as a function of the clamp voltage and the discharge parameters:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{pad}} = V_{\\mathrm{clamp}} + I_{\\mathrm{HBM}} R_{\\mathrm{on}}$$\nThe problem specifies a safety constraint: the pad voltage must not exceed $V_{\\mathrm{safe}}$. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{pad}} \\le V_{\\mathrm{safe}}$$\nSubstituting our derived expression for $V_{\\mathrm{pad}}$ into this inequality yields the condition that $V_{\\mathrm{clamp}}$ must satisfy:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{clamp}} + I_{\\mathrm{HBM}} R_{\\mathrm{on}} \\le V_{\\mathrm{safe}}$$\nTo find the maximum allowable value of $V_{\\mathrm{clamp}}$, denoted $V_{\\mathrm{clamp,max}}$, we consider the limiting case of this inequality:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{clamp,max}} + I_{\\mathrm{HBM}} R_{\\mathrm{on}} = V_{\\mathrm{safe}}$$\nSolving for $V_{\\mathrm{clamp,max}}$:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{clamp,max}} = V_{\\mathrm{safe}} - I_{\\mathrm{HBM}} R_{\\mathrm{on}}$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values provided in the problem statement:\n- $V_{\\mathrm{safe}} = 5\\ \\mathrm{V}$\n- $I_{\\mathrm{HBM}} = 2\\ \\mathrm{A}$\n- $R_{\\mathrm{on}} = 1\\ \\Omega$\n\nThe calculation is as follows:\n$$V_{\\mathrm{clamp,max}} = 5\\ \\mathrm{V} - (2\\ \\mathrm{A}) \\times (1\\ \\Omega)$$\n$$V_{\\mathrm{clamp,max}} = 5\\ \\mathrm{V} - 2\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\n$$V_{\\mathrm{clamp,max}} = 3\\ \\mathrm{V}$$\nTherefore, the maximum allowable value for the clamp voltage is $3\\ \\mathrm{V}$.",
