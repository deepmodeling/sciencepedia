            "problem": "A complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) critical timing path in an Electronic Design Automation (EDA) flow is approximated as an effective single-stage discharge of an equivalent load capacitance. The discharge-limited propagation delay is modeled from first principles as follows. When a node transitions low, the output network must remove charge $Q$ from the load where $Q = C_{\\mathrm{L}} V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$. If the average discharge current is $I_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, the time to remove $Q$ is $t_{\\mathrm{pd}} \\approx Q / I_{\\mathrm{eff}} = C_{\\mathrm{L}} V_{\\mathrm{DD}} / I_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. For short-channel devices, the effective on-current during a rail-to-rail transition can be modeled by the widely used $\\alpha$-power law abstraction rooted in the classical drift-diffusion saturation relationship: $I_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\propto \\mu \\left(V_{\\mathrm{DD}} - V_{\\mathrm{TH}}\\right)^{\\alpha}$, where $\\mu$ is the carrier mobility, $V_{\\mathrm{TH}}$ is the threshold voltage, and $\\alpha \\in (1,2)$ is a velocity-saturation-dependent exponent.\n\nUse the following scientifically grounded dependencies and corner characterizations:\n- Temperature dependence of mobility: $\\mu(T) = \\mu_{0} \\left(\\frac{T}{T_{0}}\\right)^{-m}$, with $m = 1.5$ and $T_{0} = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$ (which corresponds to $25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$).\n- Temperature dependence of threshold voltage: $V_{\\mathrm{TH}}(T) = V_{\\mathrm{TH},0} + \\kappa \\left(T - T_{0}\\right)$, with $V_{\\mathrm{TH},0} = 0.35\\,\\mathrm{V}$ and $\\kappa = -1.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{V/K}$.\n- Typical–Typical (TT) process corner: $\\mu$ scaling factor $s_{\\mu}^{\\mathrm{TT}} = 1$ and process-induced threshold shift $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{TH}}^{\\mathrm{TT}} = 0$.\n- Slow–Slow (SS) process corner: $\\mu$ scaling factor $s_{\\mu}^{\\mathrm{SS}} = 0.85$ and process-induced threshold shift $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{TH}}^{\\mathrm{SS}} = +0.05\\,\\mathrm{V}$.\n\nAssume the path delay is discharge-limited by the n-channel metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (nMOS) network and that the effective load $C_{\\mathrm{L}}$ and geometric/oxide constants cancel when forming ratios.

            "problem": "A synchronous path in a digital integrated circuit is modeled for variability using a first-order linearization of delay with respect to normalized global process parameters, consistent with standard corner-based signoff practice in Electronic Design Automation (EDA).

            "solution": "The analysis begins with the provided first-order linear model for the total path delay $D$:\n$$\nD = D_{0} + c_{g} X_{g} + c_{w} X_{w}\n$$\nHere, $X_g$ and $X_w$ are normalized, zero-mean, unit-variance Gaussian random variables representing global process variations for transistors and interconnects, respectively. The coefficients $D_0$, $c_g$, and $c_w$ are determined by the nominal circuit parameters.\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerical values for these coefficients using the provided data:\n- Number of stages $N = 10$.\n- Nominal gate delay $t_{g0} = 15$ ps.\n- Nominal wire delay $t_{w0} = 25$ ps.\n- Gate delay sensitivity $a = 0.08$.\n- Wire delay sensitivity $b = 0.16$.\n\nThe nominal total path delay $D_0$ is:\n$$\nD_{0} = N(t_{g0} + t_{w0}) = 10 \\times (15 \\text{ ps} + 25 \\text{ ps}) = 10 \\times 40 \\text{ ps} = 400 \\text{ ps}\n$$\nThe sensitivity coefficients $c_g$ and $c_w$ are:\n$$\nc_{g} = N t_{g0} a = 10 \\times 15 \\text{ ps} \\times 0.08 = 150 \\text{ ps} \\times 0.08 = 12 \\text{ ps}\n$$\n$$\nc_{w} = N t_{w0} b = 10 \\times 25 \\text{ ps} \\times 0.16 = 250 \\text{ ps} \\times 0.16 = 40 \\text{ ps}\n$$\nThus, the specific delay model for this problem is:\n$$\nD = (400 + 12 X_{g} + 40 X_{w}) \\text{ ps}\n$$\nSince both sensitivity coefficients $c_g = 12$ and $c_w = 40$ are positive, an increase in either $X_g$ or $X_w$ results in an increase in the total path delay $D$. This path is considered a \"max-path\" or \"late-path\", and we are interested in its maximum delay.\n\nNext, we analyze the two different corner-combination interpretations. The problem specifies a corner level of $k=3$.\n\n**Independent-Corners Maximum Delay ($D_{\\text{max, independent}}$)**\n\nUnder this assumption, the process parameters $X_g$ and $X_w$ are set to their worst-case marginal values independently. The problem states that the interconnect is fixed at its worst-case marginal corner, $RC_{\\max}$, which corresponds to $X_w = +k = +3$. For the transistor speed, we must choose between the Slow-Slow (SS) corner, $X_g = +k = +3$, and the Fast-Fast (FF) corner, $X_g = -k = -3$. To find the maximum delay, we must select the value of $X_g$ that maximizes the expression $D = 400 + 12 X_g + 40(3)$. Since the coefficient $c_g = 12$ is positive, we must select the largest available value for $X_g$, which is $X_g = +3$ from the SS corner.\nTherefore, the worst-case corner under this scheme is $(X_g, X_w) = (+k, +k) = (+3, +3)$. The maximum delay is:\n$$\nD_{\\text{max, independent}} = 400 + 12(+3) + 40(+3) = 400 + 36 + 120 = 556 \\text{ ps}\n$$\n\n**Correlated-Corners Maximum Delay ($D_{\\text{max, correlated}}$)**\n\nThis approach accounts for the statistical correlation $\\rho = -0.5$ between $X_g$ and $X_w$. The joint $k$-sigma worst case is defined by the set of points $(X_g, X_w)$ on the Mahalanobis ellipse:\n$$\n\\frac{X_{g}^{2} - 2 \\rho X_{g} X_{w} + X_{w}^{2}}{1 - \\rho^{2}} = k^{2}\n$$\nThe first task is to derive the transistor corner $X_g$ that is consistent with this ellipse, given the fixed worst-case interconnect corner $X_w = +k$. We substitute $X_w = k$ into the ellipse equation:\n$$\n\\frac{X_{g}^{2} - 2 \\rho X_{g} k + k^{2}}{1 - \\rho^{2}} = k^{2}\n$$\nRearranging the equation to solve for $X_g$:\n$$\nX_{g}^{2} - 2 \\rho k X_{g} + k^{2} = k^{2}(1 - \\rho^{2})\n$$\n$$\nX_{g}^{2} - 2 \\rho k X_{g} + k^{2} = k^{2} - k^{2} \\rho^{2}\n$$\n$$\nX_{g}^{2} - (2 \\rho k) X_{g} + (k^{2} \\rho^{2}) = 0\n$$\nThis is a quadratic equation in $X_g$. We recognize it as a perfect square:\n$$\n(X_g - \\rho k)^{2} = 0\n$$\nThis equation has a single, unique solution:\n$$\nX_g = \\rho k\n$$\nThis is the derived value for the transistor corner parameter under the correlated assumption, when $X_w$ is fixed to $+k$.\n\nUsing the given numerical values, $k=3$ and $\\rho = -0.5$, we find the specific transistor corner:\n$$\nX_g = (-0.5)(3) = -1.5\n$$\nThus, the correlated worst-case corner, subject to the condition $X_w = +k$, is $(X_g, X_w) = (-1.5, +3)$. The maximum delay under this correlated-corners assumption is calculated at this point:\n$$\nD_{\\text{max, correlated}} = 400 + 12(-1.5) + 40(+3) = 400 - 18 + 120 = 502 \\text{ ps}\n$$\nThis result is physically meaningful: because of the negative correlation ($\\rho  0$), when the interconnect is slow ($X_w$ is large and positive), the transistors are statistically more likely to be fast ($X_g$ is negative). The correlated corner model captures this effect, resulting in a less pessimistic (smaller) maximum delay compared to the independent-corners approach, which considers the unlikely combination of both parameters being at their slow extremes simultaneously.\n\n**Final Ratio Calculation**\n\nThe final step is to compute the dimensionless ratio $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{D_{\\text{max, correlated}}}{D_{\\text{max, independent}}} = \\frac{502 \\text{ ps}}{556 \\text{ ps}}\n$$\n$$\nR \\approx 0.902877...\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested, we get:\n$$\nR \\approx 0.9029\n$$",

            "solution": "We begin from the established statistical scaling for mismatch in integrated circuits. Random dopant fluctuations in a device active area contribute to threshold-voltage mismatch. Under conditions where local fluctuations dominate and are uncorrelated over the area, the count variations are approximately Poisson and the aggregate effect on an extensive property averaged over the device area scales inversely with the square root of the area. Consequently, the spread of a mismatch observable decreases as the active area increases.\n\nLet $W$ and $L$ denote device width and length in micrometers for a matched pair with effective active area $A = WL$ in $\\mu\\mathrm{m}^2$. Consider the mismatch $\\Delta V_t$ between a pair of nominally identical devices at a fixed geometry. The central assumption is that the standard deviation of the mismatch at that geometry is proportional to the inverse square root of area, up to other independent contributions. If the random-local component dominates, then there exists a constant $A_{V_t}$ with units $\\mathrm{V}\\cdot\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ such that the dispersion of $\\Delta V_t$ satisfies an approximately linear scaling with $x = 1/\\sqrt{WL}$.\n\nWe are given, for each geometry $i$, a set $\\{\\Delta V_{t,ij}\\}_{j=1}^{m_i}$ of mismatch measurements in volts. We compute the unbiased sample standard deviation\n$$\ns_i = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{m_i - 1} \\sum_{j=1}^{m_i} \\left(\\Delta V_{t,ij} - \\bar{\\Delta V}_{t,i}\\right)^2},\n$$\nwhich estimates the true standard deviation $\\sigma_i$ of the mismatch distribution at geometry $i$. We also compute\n$$\nx_i = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{W_i L_i}},\n$$\nwith $x_i$ in $\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$ if $W_i$ and $L_i$ are in micrometers. The working linear model for regression through the origin is\n$$\ny_i = s_i = A_{V_t} \\, x_i + \\varepsilon_i,\n$$\nwhere $\\varepsilon_i$ captures deviations from the linear scaling and sampling variability.\n\nBecause $s_i$ is itself estimated from a finite sample, its uncertainty depends on $m_i$. For data drawn from a Gaussian distribution with true standard deviation $\\sigma_i$, the statistic $(m_i - 1)s_i^2/\\sigma_i^2$ follows a chi-square distribution with $m_i - 1$ degrees of freedom. Using a delta-method approximation for the standard deviation (or exploiting known moments), one obtains\n$$\n\\mathrm{Var}[s_i] \\approx \\frac{\\sigma_i^2}{2(m_i - 1)}.\n$$\nWe substitute $\\sigma_i \\approx s_i$ to get a practical estimator of the variance:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}[y_i] \\approx \\frac{s_i^2}{2(m_i - 1)}.\n$$\nThis yields weights inversely proportional to the error variances,\n$$\nw_i = \\frac{1}{\\widehat{\\mathrm{Var}}[y_i]} \\approx \\frac{2(m_i - 1)}{s_i^2}.\n$$\n\nWith weights $w_i$ and a regression constrained through the origin, the weighted least squares estimator of the slope $A_{V_t}$ is\n$$\n\\hat{A}_{V_t} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i x_i y_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i x_i^2}.\n$$\nThe residuals are $r_i = y_i - \\hat{A}_{V_t} x_i$. An unbiased estimator of the residual variance for this one-parameter fit is\n$$\n\\hat{\\sigma}_w^2 = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i r_i^2}{\\nu}, \\quad \\nu = n - 1,\n$$\nwhere $n$ is the number of geometries. The standard error of the slope is\n$$\n\\mathrm{SE}(\\hat{A}_{V_t}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat{\\sigma}_w^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i x_i^2}}.\n$$\nAssuming approximate normality of the estimator (supported by large-sample arguments or the central limit theorem applied to regression estimators), a two-sided $95\\%$ confidence interval for $A_{V_t}$ is\n$$\n\\hat{A}_{V_t} \\pm t_{0.975,\\nu} \\, \\mathrm{SE}(\\hat{A}_{V_t}),\n$$\nwhere $t_{0.975,\\nu}$ is the $97.5$th percentile of the Student $t$-distribution with $\\nu$ degrees of freedom.\n\nAlgorithmic design:\n1. Parse each dataset, and for each geometry compute $s_i$ with degrees of freedom $1$ from the raw $\\Delta V_t$ list to obtain $y_i$ in volts.\n2. Compute $x_i = 1/\\sqrt{W_i L_i}$ using micrometers for $W_i$ and $L_i$.\n3. Compute $w_i = 2(m_i - 1)/s_i^2$ for $m_i \\ge 3$.\n4. Evaluate $\\hat{A}_{V_t}$ by the weighted through-origin formula, and then compute $\\hat{\\sigma}_w^2$, $\\mathrm{SE}(\\hat{A}_{V_t})$, and the confidence bounds using the Student $t$-distribution with $\\nu = n - 1$.\n5. The units for the coefficient $\\hat{A}_{V_t}$ are derived from the regression model $y_i = A_{V_t} x_i$. With $y_i$ in volts (V) and $x_i$ in inverse micrometers ($\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$), the units for $A_{V_t}$ must be V/($\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$) or V·μm. The final results are reported in V·μm.\n6. Output the flattened list $[\\hat{A}_{V_t}^{(1)}, \\mathrm{CI}_{\\mathrm{low}}^{(1)}, \\mathrm{CI}_{\\mathrm{high}}^{(1)}, \\hat{A}_{V_t}^{(2)}, \\mathrm{CI}_{\\mathrm{low}}^{(2)}, \\mathrm{CI}_{\\mathrm{high}}^{(2)}, \\hat{A}_{V_t}^{(3)}, \\mathrm{CI}_{\\mathrm{low}}^{(3)}, \\mathrm{CI}_{\\mathrm{high}}^{(3)}]$ in a single line, optionally rounded for display.\n\nEdge cases and justification:\n- The weighting corrects for heteroscedasticity due to differing $m_i$, which otherwise biases the regression toward geometries with larger sampling noise in $s_i$.\n- Degrees of freedom $\\nu = n - 1$ reflect one fitted parameter (the slope) in the through-origin model.\n- The use of the Student $t$-distribution is appropriate for small $n$ to account for the uncertainty in the residual variance estimate.",
