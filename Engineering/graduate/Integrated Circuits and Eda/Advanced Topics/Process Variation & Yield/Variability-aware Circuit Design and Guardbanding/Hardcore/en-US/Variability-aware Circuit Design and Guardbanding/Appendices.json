This exercise explores the fundamental question of how large this margin must be.

            "problem": "A single critical path delay in a synchronous integrated circuit is modeled as a real-valued random variable $D$ due to Process, Voltage, and Temperature (PVT) variability. The design adopts guardbanding: the clock period is set to $T_{\\text{clk}} = \\mu + g$, where $\\mu$ is the mean of $D$ and $g$ is the guardband. The target failure probability (timing violation) per path is specified as $\\alpha$, so the yield requirement is $P(D \\leq \\mu + g) \\geq 1 - \\alpha$. Only the mean and variance of $D$ are known: $\\mathbb{E}[D] = \\mu$ and $\\operatorname{Var}(D) = \\sigma^{2}$. \n\nStarting from the definition of yield and the foundational tail-probability bounding principles given by Chebyshev’s inequality and Cantelli’s inequality (one-sided Chebyshev), derive from first principles the minimum guardband $g$ that guarantees the yield requirement when only $\\mu$ and $\\sigma^{2}$ are known.

Round your numerical answers to four significant figures. The final answer must be a single row matrix and must contain only numbers (no units), while the problem statement specifies that the unit is nanoseconds (ns).",
            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of statistical circuit analysis and probability theory, well-posed with a clear objective and sufficient data, and free from ambiguity or contradiction. It poses a standard, formalizable problem in variability-aware integrated circuit design. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the minimum guardband $g$ under three different sets of assumptions to satisfy a yield requirement. The yield requirement is given by $P(D \\leq \\mu + g) \\geq 1 - \\alpha$, where $D$ is the random variable representing the path delay, $\\mu$ is its mean, and $\\alpha$ is the target failure probability. This is equivalent to constraining the probability of a timing failure, $P(D > \\mu + g)$, to be no more than $\\alpha$:\n$$P(D > \\mu + g) \\leq \\alpha$$\n\nLet $\\mathbb{E}[D] = \\mu$ and $\\operatorname{Var}(D) = \\sigma^{2}$. The guardband $g$ is added to the mean delay, so the clock period is $T_{\\text{clk}} = \\mu + g$. We will derive the expression for $g$ and then evaluate it for the given parameters.\n\n**1. Guardband Derivation using Chebyshev’s Inequality**\n\nChebyshev's inequality provides a bound on the probability that a random variable deviates from its mean. For any random variable $X$ with finite mean $\\mu_X$ and finite non-zero variance $\\sigma_X^2$, and for any real number $k > 0$, the inequality states:\n$$P(|X - \\mu_X| \\geq k) \\leq \\frac{\\sigma_X^2}{k^2}$$\nWe apply this to the delay $D$, where $X=D$, $\\mu_X=\\mu$, and $\\sigma_X^2=\\sigma^2$. We are interested in the event $D > \\mu + g$, which is equivalent to $D - \\mu > g$. This one-sided event is a subset of the two-sided event $|D - \\mu| > g$. Therefore, the probability of our event of interest is bounded by the probability of the two-sided event:\n$$P(D > \\mu + g) \\leq P(|D - \\mu| > g)$$\nFor a continuous random variable, the use of $>$ versus $\\geq$ does not change the probability. Let's set $k=g$ in Chebyshev's inequality ($g$ must be positive, which is physically required for a guardband).\n$$P(|D - \\mu| \\geq g) \\leq \\frac{\\sigma^2}{g^2}$$\nTo satisfy the yield requirement $P(D > \\mu + g) \\leq \\alpha$, it is sufficient to enforce the condition that the upper bound provided by Chebyshev's inequality is equal to $\\alpha$. This guarantees that the failure probability will be no more than $\\alpha$.\n$$\\frac{\\sigma^2}{g^2} = \\alpha$$\nSolving for the minimum guardband $g$ that this inequality can guarantee, we get:\n$$g^2 = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\alpha} \\implies g = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}}$$\nThis is the Chebyshev-based guardband, which we denote as $g_{\\text{Cheby}}$.\n$$g_{\\text{Cheby}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{\\alpha}}$$\n\n**2. Guardband Derivation using Cantelli’s Inequality (One-Sided Chebyshev)**\n\nCantelli's inequality provides a tighter, one-sided bound. For a random variable $X$ with mean $\\mu_X$ and variance $\\sigma_X^2$, and for any $\\lambda > 0$, it states:\n$$P(X - \\mu_X \\geq \\lambda) \\leq \\frac{\\sigma_X^2}{\\sigma_X^2 + \\lambda^2}$$\nWe are interested in bounding $P(D > \\mu + g)$, which is $P(D - \\mu > g)$. Again assuming $D$ is continuous, this is the same as $P(D - \\mu \\geq g)$. We apply Cantelli's inequality with $X=D$ and $\\lambda=g$.\n$$P(D - \\mu \\geq g) \\leq \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\sigma^2 + g^2}$$\nTo guarantee the yield requirement, we set this bound to be equal to $\\alpha$:\n$$\\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\sigma^2 + g^2} = \\alpha$$\nNow, we solve for the minimum guardband $g$ guaranteed by this inequality, which we denote $g_{\\text{Cantelli}}$:\n$$\\sigma^2 = \\alpha (\\sigma^2 + g^2)$$\n$$\\sigma^2 = \\alpha\\sigma^2 + \\alpha g^2$$\n$$\\sigma^2(1 - \\alpha) = \\alpha g^2$$\n$$g^2 = \\frac{\\sigma^2(1 - \\alpha)}{\\alpha}$$\n$$g_{\\text{Cantelli}} = \\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - \\alpha}{\\alpha}}$$\nAs $1-\\alpha  1$, this guardband is strictly smaller (tighter) than the one derived from the two-sided Chebyshev inequality, which is expected.\n\n**3. Guardband Derivation assuming a Gaussian Distribution**\n\nUnder the assumption that the delay $D$ follows a Gaussian (Normal) distribution, $D \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$, we can calculate the failure probability exactly. The requirement is to find the minimum $g$ such that:\n$$P(D > \\mu + g) = \\alpha$$\nTo evaluate this probability, we standardize the random variable $D$. Let $Z = \\frac{D-\\mu}{\\sigma}$. The variable $Z$ follows the standard normal distribution, $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$. The inequality $D > \\mu + g$ is transformed as follows:\n$$\\frac{D - \\mu}{\\sigma} > \\frac{(\\mu + g) - \\mu}{\\sigma}$$\n$$Z > \\frac{g}{\\sigma}$$\nThe probability requirement becomes:\n$$P\\left(Z > \\frac{g}{\\sigma}\\right) = \\alpha$$\nLet $\\Phi(z)$ be the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution, i.e., $\\Phi(z) = P(Z \\leq z)$. The tail probability is $P(Z > z) = 1 - \\Phi(z)$. Thus, we have:\n$$1 - \\Phi\\left(\\frac{g}{\\sigma}\\right) = \\alpha \\implies \\Phi\\left(\\frac{g}{\\sigma}\\right) = 1 - \\alpha$$\nTo find the argument of $\\Phi$, we use the inverse CDF, or the quantile function, $\\Phi^{-1}$:\n$$\\frac{g}{\\sigma} = \\Phi^{-1}(1 - \\alpha)$$\nSolving for the Gaussian-based guardband, $g_{\\text{Gauss}}$:\n$$g_{\\text{Gauss}} = \\sigma \\, \\Phi^{-1}(1 - \\alpha)$$\nThe term $\\Phi^{-1}(1 - \\alpha)$ represents the $(1-\\alpha)$-quantile of the standard normal distribution.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe are given the following parameter values:\n$\\mu = 1.0\\,\\text{ns}$\n$\\sigma = 0.05\\,\\text{ns}$\n$\\alpha = 0.01$\n\nWe now calculate the three guardbands and round the results to four significant figures.\n\n1.  **Chebyshev-based guardband:**\n    $g_{\\text{Cheby}} = \\frac{0.05}{\\sqrt{0.01}} = \\frac{0.05}{0.1} = 0.5\\,\\text{ns}$.\n    To four significant figures, this is $0.5000\\,\\text{ns}$.\n\n2.  **Cantelli-based guardband:**\n    $g_{\\text{Cantelli}} = 0.05 \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - 0.01}{0.01}} = 0.05 \\sqrt{\\frac{0.99}{0.01}} = 0.05 \\sqrt{99}$.\n    Using a calculator, $\\sqrt{99} \\approx 9.949874$.\n    $g_{\\text{Cantelli}} \\approx 0.05 \\times 9.949874 \\approx 0.4974937\\,\\text{ns}$.\n    Rounding to four significant figures gives $0.4975\\,\\text{ns}$.\n\n3.  **Gaussian-based guardband:**\n    $g_{\\text{Gauss}} = 0.05 \\times \\Phi^{-1}(1 - 0.01) = 0.05 \\times \\Phi^{-1}(0.99)$.\n    The value $\\Phi^{-1}(0.99)$ is the z-score that corresponds to a cumulative probability of $0.99$. From standard statistical tables or a calculator, $\\Phi^{-1}(0.99) \\approx 2.326348$.\n    $g_{\\text{Gauss}} \\approx 0.05 \\times 2.326348 \\approx 0.1163174\\,\\text{ns}$.\n    Rounding to four significant figures gives $0.1163\\,\\text{ns}$.\n\nThe three guardbands, in the specified order (Chebyshev, Cantelli, Gaussian), are $0.5000\\,\\text{ns}$, $0.4975\\,\\text{ns}$, and $0.1163\\,\\text{ns}$. The non-parametric bounds are significantly more pessimistic (larger guardband) than the bound derived assuming a specific distribution, which is a well-known result. The Gaussian assumption leverages more information about the underlying process, resulting in a much more optimistic and efficient guardband.",

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of statistical circuit analysis, well-posed with a clear objective and sufficient data, and free from any factual or logical inconsistencies. We may therefore proceed with a full solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into three parts. We will address them sequentially.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Decorrelating and Normalizing Transformation**\n\nWe are given a zero-mean Gaussian random vector $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{3}$ with a covariance matrix $\\Sigma = E[xx^{\\top}]$. We seek a linear transformation $x \\to z$ such that the components of $z$ are uncorrelated and have unit variance. This means the covariance matrix of $z$ must be the identity matrix, i.e., $\\text{Cov}(z) = I$.\n\nLet the transformation be $z = A x$ for some matrix $A$. The covariance of $z$ is given by:\n$$\n\\text{Cov}(z) = E[zz^{\\top}] = E[(Ax)(Ax)^{\\top}] = E[A x x^{\\top} A^{\\top}] = A E[x x^{\\top}] A^{\\top} = A \\Sigma A^{\\top}\n$$\nSo we must find a matrix $A$ such that $A \\Sigma A^{\\top} = I$.\n\nThe covariance matrix $\\Sigma$ is real and symmetric. By the spectral theorem, it can be orthogonally diagonalized as:\n$$\n\\Sigma = V \\Lambda V^{\\top}\n$$\nwhere $V$ is an orthogonal matrix whose columns are the eigenvectors of $\\Sigma$ (satisfying $V^{\\top}V = VV^{\\top} = I$), and $\\Lambda$ is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries $\\lambda_i$ are the corresponding eigenvalues of $\\Sigma$. Since $\\Sigma$ is a covariance matrix, it is positive semidefinite, and thus its eigenvalues are non-negative, $\\lambda_i \\geq 0$. We already verified in the validation step that $\\Sigma$ is positive definite, so all $\\lambda_i > 0$.\n\nLet's substitute the eigendecomposition into our target equation:\n$$\nA (V \\Lambda V^{\\top}) A^{\\top} = I\n$$\nThis suggests choosing $A$ in a way that simplifies this expression. A two-step process is intuitive: first decorrelate, then normalize.\n\nStep (i): Decorrelation (Principal Component Analysis). Let's define an intermediate variable $y = V^{\\top}x$. This transformation projects the data $x$ onto the basis of eigenvectors of $\\Sigma$. The covariance of $y$ is:\n$$\n\\text{Cov}(y) = V^{\\top} \\Sigma V = V^{\\top} (V \\Lambda V^{\\top}) V = (V^{\\top}V) \\Lambda (V^{\\top}V) = I \\Lambda I = \\Lambda\n$$\nSince $\\Lambda$ is a diagonal matrix, the components of $y$ are uncorrelated. The variance of the $i$-th component, $y_i$, is $\\text{Var}(y_i) = \\lambda_i$.\n\nStep (ii): Normalization (Whitening). To make the variances equal to one, we must scale each component $y_i$ by $1/\\sqrt{\\lambda_i}$. Let $\\Lambda^{-1/2}$ be the diagonal matrix with entries $1/\\sqrt{\\lambda_i}$. We define $z = \\Lambda^{-1/2} y$. The covariance of $z$ is:\n$$\n\\text{Cov}(z) = \\Lambda^{-1/2} \\text{Cov}(y) (\\Lambda^{-1/2})^{\\top} = \\Lambda^{-1/2} \\Lambda \\Lambda^{-1/2} = I\n$$\nThis is the desired result. Combining the two steps, the complete transformation is:\n$$\nz = \\Lambda^{-1/2} y = \\Lambda^{-1/2} (V^{\\top} x) = (\\Lambda^{-1/2} V^{\\top}) x\n$$\nThus, the required transformation matrix is $A = \\Lambda^{-1/2} V^{\\top}$. The transformation that maps $x$ to $z$ is $z = \\Lambda^{-1/2} V^{\\top} x$.\n\n**Part 2: Expressing Delay in Terms of the Transformed Variable**\n\nThe path delay is given by $t = t_{\\text{nom}} + g^{\\top} x$. We need to express this in the form $t = t_{\\text{nom}} + c^{\\top} z$. To do this, we first express $x$ in terms of $z$ by inverting the transformation from Part 1.\nStarting from $z = \\Lambda^{-1/2} V^{\\top} x$:\n$$\n\\Lambda^{1/2} z = V^{\\top} x\n$$\nMultiplying by $V$ on the left and using $VV^{\\top}=I$:\n$$\nV \\Lambda^{1/2} z = V V^{\\top} x = I x = x\n$$\nSo, $x = V \\Lambda^{1/2} z$.\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $x$ into the delay equation:\n$$\nt = t_{\\text{nom}} + g^{\\top} (V \\Lambda^{1/2} z)\n$$\nBy the associative property of matrix multiplication, this can be written as:\n$$\nt = t_{\\text{nom}} + (g^{\\top} V \\Lambda^{1/2}) z\n$$\nThis is in the form $t = t_{\\text{nom}} + c^{\\top} z$, where the row vector $c^{\\top}$ is given by $c^{\\top} = g^{\\top} V \\Lambda^{1/2}$. The corresponding column vector $c$ is the transpose of this expression:\n$$\nc = (g^{\\top} V \\Lambda^{1/2})^{\\top} = (\\Lambda^{1/2})^{\\top} V^{\\top} (g^{\\top})^{\\top} = \\Lambda^{1/2} V^{\\top} g\n$$\nsince $\\Lambda^{1/2}$ is diagonal and thus symmetric. The vector $c$ is therefore $c = \\Lambda^{1/2} V^{\\top} g$.\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of Guardband**\n\nFirst, we must compute the variance of the delay, $\\sigma_t^2 = \\text{Var}(t)$. The delay is $t = t_{\\text{nom}} + g^{\\top} x$. Since $t_{\\text{nom}}$ is a deterministic constant, it does not contribute to the variance.\n$$\n\\sigma_t^2 = \\text{Var}(t) = \\text{Var}(t_{\\text{nom}} + g^{\\top} x) = \\text{Var}(g^{\\top} x)\n$$\nFor a random vector $x$ with covariance matrix $\\Sigma$ and a constant vector $g$, the variance of the scalar random variable $g^{\\top}x$ is given by the quadratic form:\n$$\n\\sigma_t^2 = g^{\\top} \\Sigma g\n$$\nUsing the provided numerical values for $g$ and $\\Sigma$:\n$$\ng = \\begin{pmatrix} 10 \\\\ 5 \\\\ 7 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad \\Sigma = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.04  0.018  -0.012 \\\\ 0.018  0.09  -0.015 \\\\ -0.012  -0.015  0.025 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe compute the product $\\Sigma g$:\n$$\n\\Sigma g = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.04(10) + 0.018(5) - 0.012(7) \\\\ 0.018(10) + 0.09(5) - 0.015(7) \\\\ -0.012(10) - 0.015(5) + 0.025(7) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.4 + 0.09 - 0.084 \\\\ 0.18 + 0.45 - 0.105 \\\\ -0.12 - 0.075 + 0.175 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.406 \\\\ 0.525 \\\\ -0.02 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we compute the dot product $g^{\\top}(\\Sigma g)$:\n$$\n\\sigma_t^2 = g^{\\top} (\\Sigma g) = \\begin{pmatrix} 10  5  7 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.406 \\\\ 0.525 \\\\ -0.02 \\end{pmatrix} = 10(0.406) + 5(0.525) + 7(-0.02)\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_t^2 = 4.06 + 2.625 - 0.14 = 6.545\n$$\nThe variance of the delay is $\\sigma_t^2 = 6.545$ ps$^2$. The standard deviation is $\\sigma_t = \\sqrt{6.545}$ ps.\n\nThe delay $t$ is a linear transformation of a jointly Gaussian random vector $x$. Therefore, $t$ is itself a Gaussian random variable. Its mean is $E[t] = E[t_{\\text{nom}} + g^{\\top}x] = t_{\\text{nom}} + g^{\\top}E[x] = t_{\\text{nom}}$, since $x$ is zero-mean. So, $t \\sim \\mathcal{N}(t_{\\text{nom}}, \\sigma_t^2)$.\n\nWe need to find the guardband $\\Delta t$ such that $\\mathbb{P}( t \\leq t_{\\text{nom}} + \\Delta t ) = 0.99865$. We standardize the random variable $t$ by defining $Z = (t - E[t]) / \\sigma_t = (t - t_{\\text{nom}}) / \\sigma_t$. $Z$ follows a standard normal distribution, $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$.\nThe condition becomes:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}\\left( \\frac{t - t_{\\text{nom}}}{\\sigma_t} \\leq \\frac{(t_{\\text{nom}} + \\Delta t) - t_{\\text{nom}}}{\\sigma_t} \\right) = \\mathbb{P}\\left( Z \\leq \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\sigma_t} \\right) = 0.99865\n$$\nLet $k = \\Delta t / \\sigma_t$. We need to find the value $k$ such that $\\Phi(k) = 0.99865$, where $\\Phi$ is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution. This is a well-known value corresponding to three standard deviations from the mean. Specifically, $\\Phi(3) \\approx 0.99865$.\nTherefore, we set $k = 3$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\sigma_t} = 3 \\implies \\Delta t = 3\\sigma_t\n$$\nSubstituting the value of $\\sigma_t$:\n$$\n\\Delta t = 3 \\sqrt{6.545} \\approx 3 \\times 2.5583197... \\approx 7.674959...\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\Delta t \\approx 7.675 \\text{ ps}\n$$",

Standardizing the variable $\\delta$ by letting $Z = \\delta/\\sigma_D$, where $Z \\sim N(0,1)$, this condition becomes $P(-k \\le Z \\le k) = y$.\n\nWe can express this probability using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution, $\\Phi(z)$:\n$$P(-k \\le Z \\le k) = \\Phi(k) - \\Phi(-k)$$\nUsing the symmetry property $\\Phi(-k) = 1 - \\Phi(k)$, we have:\n$$2\\Phi(k) - 1 = y$$\nSubstituting $y = 0.999$:\n$$2\\Phi(k) - 1 = 0.999 \\implies 2\\Phi(k) = 1.999 \\implies \\Phi(k) = 0.9995$$\nThe value of $k$ is the quantile of the standard normal distribution corresponding to a cumulative probability of $0.9995$. From statistical tables or an inverse CDF calculator, we find:\n$$k = \\Phi^{-1}(0.9995) \\approx 3.290527$$\nThe range of duty-cycle distortion we must guardband against is therefore $\\delta \\in [-k\\sigma_D, k\\sigma_D]$.\n\nNext, we establish the timing constraints. A positive slack indicates that the timing constraint is met. The yield requirement translates to satisfying the following two conditions for all $\\delta$ in the interval $[-k\\sigma_D, k\\sigma_D]$:\n1.  Setup constraint: The setup slack, including the guardband $g_T$, must be non-negative.\n    $$S(\\delta) + g_T \\ge 0 \\implies (S_0 + \\alpha \\delta) + g_T \\ge 0$$\n2.  Hold constraint: The hold slack must be non-negative. The guardband $g_T$ does not affect hold slack.\n    $$H(\\delta) \\ge 0 \\implies H_0 + \\beta \\delta \\ge 0$$\n\nThese constraints must hold for the entire interval of $\\delta$, so we must check them at their respective worst-case points. Since the slack functions are linear in $\\delta$, the minimum values will occur at the endpoints of the interval, $\\delta = \\pm k\\sigma_D$.\n\nFor the hold constraint, the slack is $H(\\delta) = H_0 + \\beta \\delta$. We are given $\\beta = +150\\ \\mathrm{ps}$, which is positive. Therefore, the hold slack is minimized when $\\delta$ is minimized, i.e., at $\\delta = -k\\sigma_D$. The worst-case hold constraint is:\n$$H_0 + \\beta(-k\\sigma_D) \\ge 0 \\implies H_0 \\ge k\\beta\\sigma_D$$\nLet's verify this condition using the given parameters, as the problem states hold is feasible.\n$$k\\beta\\sigma_D \\approx (3.290527)(150)(0.02)\\ \\mathrm{ps} = 9.871581\\ \\mathrm{ps}$$\nSince $H_0 = 20\\ \\mathrm{ps}$, the condition $20\\ \\mathrm{ps} \\ge 9.871581\\ \\mathrm{ps}$ is satisfied. This confirms the problem's assumption.\n\nFor the setup constraint, the slack is $S(\\delta) + g_T = S_0 + \\alpha\\delta + g_T$. We are given $\\alpha = -300\\ \\mathrm{ps}$, which is negative. Therefore, the setup slack is minimized when $\\delta$ is maximized, i.e., at $\\delta = +k\\sigma_D$. The worst-case setup constraint is:\n$$S_0 + \\alpha(k\\sigma_D) + g_T \\ge 0$$\nWe need to find the minimum value of $g_T$ that satisfies this inequality. The minimum value is achieved when the equality holds:\n$$g_{T, \\text{min}} = -S_0 - \\alpha k \\sigma_D$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values into this expression:\n- $S_0 = 10\\ \\mathrm{ps}$\n- $\\alpha = -300\\ \\mathrm{ps}$\n- $k \\approx 3.290527$\n- $\\sigma_D = 0.02$\n\n$$g_{T, \\text{min}} = -10 - (-300) \\times (3.290527) \\times (0.02)$$\n$$g_{T, \\text{min}} = -10 + 300 \\times (0.06581054)$$\n$$g_{T, \\text{min}} = -10 + 19.743162$$\n$$g_{T, \\text{min}} = 9.743162\\ \\mathrm{ps}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$g_{T, \\text{min}} \\approx 9.743\\ \\mathrm{ps}$$\nThis is the minimum period guardband required to ensure both setup and hold timing yield targets are met under the specified duty-cycle variation model.",
