            "problem": "Consider a two-dimensional $k \\times k$ mesh Network-on-Chip (NoC), where each tile at coordinates $(i,j)$, with $i,j \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,k-1\\}$, contains a router. The mesh uses deterministic dimension-order $X$-$Y$ routing, and every physical link is bidirectional with an independent per-direction capacity of $b$ flits per cycle. Assume single-flit packets and uniform steady-state injection: each node injects at rate $\\lambda$ flits per cycle, destined according to the synthetic transpose traffic pattern, that is, a packet sourced at $(i,j)$ is destined to $(j,i)$. Self-traffic along the diagonal $(i=j)$ does not consume any links.

Derive the offered load, in flits per cycle, on an arbitrary directed horizontal link between $(x,y)$ and $(x+1,y)$ and on an arbitrary directed vertical link between $(c,r)$ and $(c,r+1)$, as functions of $k$, $x$, $y$, $c$, $r$, and the injection rate $\\lambda$.\n\n2.

No rounding is required. In your derivation, clearly identify the saturated links you found, but provide only $\\lambda^{\\star}$ as your final numeric expression.",
            "solution": "### Derivation\n\nThe problem requires a derivation of the offered load on network links under transpose traffic, identification of the bottleneck links, and calculation of the maximum sustainable injection rate. We proceed by analyzing the paths taken by packets.\n\nUnder deterministic $X-Y$ routing, a packet from a source node $S = (i_s, j_s)$ to a destination node $D = (i_d, j_d)$ first travels horizontally along row $j_s$ until it reaches column $i_d$, and then travels vertically along column $i_d$ to reach row $j_d$. The turn from horizontal to vertical movement occurs at node $(i_d, j_s)$.\n\nFor the specified transpose traffic pattern, the destination for a packet from $S=(i_s, j_s)$ is $D=(j_s, i_s)$. Therefore, the path is composed of a horizontal segment from $(i_s, j_s)$ to $(j_s, j_s)$, followed by a vertical segment from $(j_s, j_s)$ to $(j_s, i_s)$. Note that for diagonal nodes where $i_s=j_s$, the source and destination are the same, and the problem states this self-traffic consumes no links. We only consider $i_s \\neq j_s$.\n\n**1. Offered Load on Directed Links**\n\nWe are asked to derive the load for a rightward horizontal link and an upward vertical link.\n\n**Load on a horizontal link $(x,y) \\rightarrow (x+1,y)$:**\nLet $L_h(x,y \\rightarrow x+1,y)$ be the traffic load on the directed horizontal link from node $(x,y)$ to $(x+1,y)$. For a packet from source $(i_s, j_s)$ to traverse this link, its path must include this segment. According to $X-Y$ routing for a transpose destination $(j_s, i_s)$, this requires:\n- The packet must travel along row $y$, so $j_s = y$.\n- The horizontal travel must be rightward, which implies the destination column $j_s$ is to the right of the source column $i_s$. Thus, $i_s < j_s$.\n- The specific link from column $x$ to $x+1$ must be part of the horizontal path from column $i_s$ to $j_s$. This means $i_s \\le x < j_s$.\n\nCombining these conditions for a given link $(x,y) \\rightarrow (x+1,y)$: the contributing source nodes $(i_s, j_s)$ must satisfy $j_s = y$ and $i_s \\le x < y$.\nThe condition $x < y$ is a necessary prerequisite for the link to carry any transpose traffic. If $x \\ge y$, no source $(i_s, y)$ with $i_s < y$ can exist that also satisfies $i_s \\le x$, so the load is $0$.\nIf $x < y$, the contributing sources are the set of nodes $\\{(i_s, y) | 0 \\le i_s \\le x\\}$. The number of such source nodes is $x+1$.\nSince each node injects at a rate of $\\lambda$ flits per cycle, the total load on this link is the sum of the injection rates from all contributing sources.\n$$\nL_{h}(x,y \\rightarrow x+1,y) = \n\\begin{cases} \n\\lambda (x+1) & \\text{if } y > x \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } y \\le x \n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwhere $x \\in \\{0, \\dots, k-2\\}$ and $y \\in \\{0, \\dots, k-1\\}$.\n\n**Load on a vertical link $(c,r) \\rightarrow (c,r+1)$:**\nLet $L_v(c,r \\rightarrow c,r+1)$ be the traffic load on the directed vertical link from node $(c,r)$ to $(c,r+1)$. A packet from source $(i_s, j_s)$ to destination $(j_s, i_s)$ traverses this link if:\n- The vertical leg of its journey occurs on column $c$. The vertical path is entirely on the destination column, so $j_s = c$.\n- The vertical travel must be upward (row index increasing), which implies the destination row $i_s$ is greater than the source row $j_s$. Thus, $i_s > j_s$.\n- The specific link from row $r$ to $r+1$ must be part of the vertical path from row $j_s$ to row $i_s$. This means $j_s \\le r < i_s$.\n\nCombining these conditions for a given link $(c,r) \\rightarrow (c,r+1)$: the contributing source nodes $(i_s, j_s)$ must satisfy $j_s = c$, $i_s > c$, and $c \\le r < i_s$.\nThe condition $c \\le r$ is necessary. If $c > r$, the condition $j_s \\le r$ (with $j_s=c$) cannot be met, so the load is $0$.\nIf $c \\le r$, the conditions on the source node's coordinates $(i_s, j_s)$ become: $j_s=c$ and $i_s > r$ (since $i_s > c$ is implied by $i_s > r$ and $r \\ge c$).\nThe contributing sources are the set of nodes $\\{(i_s, c) | r < i_s \\le k-1\\}$. The number of such source nodes is $(k-1) - (r+1) + 1 = k-1-r$.\nThe total load on this link is:\n$$\nL_{v}(c,r \\rightarrow c,r+1) = \n\\begin{cases} \n\\lambda (k-1-r) & \\text{if } c \\le r \\\\\n0 & \\text{if } c > r \n\\end{cases}\n$$\nwhere $c \\in \\{0, \\dots, k-1\\}$ and $r \\in \\{0, \\dots, k-2\\}$.\n\n**2. Identification of Saturated Links**\n\nSaturation occurs on the link(s) with the maximum offered load. We must find the maximum load by maximizing the expressions derived above over their respective domains.\n\nFor horizontal links (rightward): $L_{h}(x,y \\rightarrow x+1,y) = \\lambda (x+1)$ for $y > x$. To maximize this, we must maximize $x$. The domain for $x$ is $\\{0, \\dots, k-2\\}$. The maximum value is $x = k-2$. This gives a load of $\\lambda(k-2+1) = \\lambda(k-1)$. This maximum is achieved when $x=k-2$ and the condition $y > x$ is met. This means $y > k-2$, which, given $y \\le k-1$, implies $y=k-1$.\nThus, the maximum rightward horizontal load is $L_{h,max} = \\lambda(k-1)$, occurring uniquely on the link $((k-2, k-1), (k-1, k-1))$.\n\nFor vertical links (upward): $L_{v}(c,r \\rightarrow c,r+1) = \\lambda (k-1-r)$ for $c \\le r$. To maximize this, we must minimize $r$. The domain for $r$ is $\\{0, \\dots, k-2\\}$. The minimum value is $r=0$. This gives a load of $\\lambda(k-1-0) = \\lambda(k-1)$. This maximum is achieved when $r=0$ and the condition $c \\le r$ is met. This means $c \\le 0$, which implies $c=0$.\nThus, the maximum upward vertical load is $L_{v,max} = \\lambda(k-1)$, occurring uniquely on the link $((0, 0), (0, 1))$.\n\nThe maximum load found from these expressions is $L_{max} = \\lambda(k-1)$.\nA complete analysis requires checking all four directions. A similar derivation for leftward and downward links reveals that the same maximum load $\\lambda(k-1)$ is also reached on link $((1,0),(0,0))$ (leftward) and link $((k-1,k-1),(k-1,k-2))$ (downward).\nTherefore, the set of directed links that become saturated consists of these four links:\n- $((k-2, k-1), (k-1, k-1))$\n- $((0, 0), (0, 1))$\n- $((1, 0), (0, 0))$\n- $((k-1, k-1), (k-1, k-2))$\n\n**3. Critical Injection Rate $\\lambda^{\\star}$**\n\nThe system saturates when the load on the most heavily utilized link equals the link capacity $b$. We found the maximum load on any link to be $L_{max} = \\lambda(k-1)$.\nLet $\\lambda^{\\star}$ be the critical injection rate at which saturation first occurs. At this point:\n$$L_{max} = b$$\n$$\\lambda^{\\star} (k-1) = b$$\nSolving for $\\lambda^{\\star}$, we get:\n$$\\lambda^{\\star} = \\frac{b}{k-1}$$\nThis expression is valid for $k \\ge 2$. For $k=1$, a single-node mesh, there are no links and no traffic, so saturation is not a meaningful concept and the formula is undefined, which is consistent.",

            "problem": "Consider a Network-on-Chip (NoC) constructed as a flattened butterfly topology over $n$ dimensions with dimension sizes $\\{k_{0},k_{1},\\dots,k_{n-1}\\}$, where each router is identified by an $n$-tuple coordinate $\\mathbf{x}=(x_{0},x_{1},\\dots,x_{n-1})$ with $0 \\leq x_{i} \\leq k_{i}-1$ for each $i$. In a flattened butterfly, routers connect directly to all other routers that differ in exactly one coordinate. Thus, at each router, the inter-router ports are organized into $n$ dimension groups, with group $i$ containing $k_{i}-1$ ports to the routers whose coordinates equal $\\mathbf{x}$ on all coordinates except coordinate $i$, which is any one of the remaining $k_{i}-1$ values.\n\nAssume deterministic minimal routing that always selects an outgoing inter-router port that reduces the Hamming distance between the current router’s coordinate $\\mathbf{x}$ and the destination coordinate $\\mathbf{y}=(y_{0},y_{1},\\dots,y_{n-1})$. A baseline destination-indexed routing table stores, for every destination coordinate $\\mathbf{y}\\neq\\mathbf{x}$, the encoded index of the inter-router output port to be used on the first hop. Each table entry encodes one of the inter-router ports available at the router. Let the number of inter-router ports at a router be denoted by $r_{\\mathrm{net}}$.\n\nStarting only from the core definitions of the flattened butterfly topology and the deterministic minimal routing rule, derive a closed-form expression for the total number of bits of storage required per router by such a baseline destination-indexed routing table. Then, explain how embedded coordinate routing—where the router computes the output port index directly from the source and destination coordinates at run time—can reduce table storage to $O(1)$ per port. Express your final answer in bits as a single analytic expression, and do not round or approximate.",
            "solution": "The solution is developed in two parts as requested. First, we derive the storage cost for the destination-indexed routing table. Second, we explain the principle of embedded coordinate routing and its storage benefits.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Routing Table Storage**\n\nThe total storage for a routing table at a single router is the product of the number of entries in the table and the number of bits required for each entry.\n\n1.  **Total Number of Routers:** The NoC is structured as an $n$-dimensional grid where the size of dimension $i$ is $k_i$. The total number of routers, $N$, is the total number of unique coordinates in the system. This is the product of the sizes of all dimensions:\n    $$N = \\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} k_i$$\n\n2.  **Number of Table Entries per Router:** The problem states that the destination-indexed routing table at a given router $\\mathbf{x}$ stores an entry for every possible destination coordinate $\\mathbf{y}$ *except* for itself. Therefore, the number of entries in the table is $N - 1$.\n    $$\\text{Number of entries} = \\left(\\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} k_i\\right) - 1$$\n\n3.  **Number of Inter-Router Ports per Router:** The total number of inter-router output ports at a router, denoted $r_{\\mathrm{net}}$, determines the number of possible outcomes for a routing decision. The problem specifies that for each dimension $i$, there are $k_i-1$ ports connecting to other routers that differ only in the $i$-th coordinate. The total number of ports is the sum of the ports across all $n$ dimensions:\n    $$r_{\\mathrm{net}} = \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (k_i - 1)$$\n\n4.  **Bits per Table Entry:** Each entry in the routing table must uniquely identify one of the $r_{\\mathrm{net}}$ output ports. To encode $r_{\\mathrm{net}}$ distinct values, we need a minimum number of bits given by the base-$2$ logarithm. Since the number of bits must be an integer, we take the ceiling of this value.\n    $$\\text{Bits per entry} = \\lceil \\log_{2}(r_{\\mathrm{net}}) \\rceil = \\left\\lceil \\log_{2}\\left(\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (k_i - 1)\\right) \\right\\rceil$$\n\n5.  **Total Storage per Router:** The total required storage in bits, $S$, is the number of entries multiplied by the bits per entry.\n    $$S = (\\text{Number of entries}) \\times (\\text{Bits per entry})$$\n    Substituting the expressions from the steps above, we arrive at the closed-form expression for the total storage:\n    $$S = \\left(\\left(\\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} k_i\\right) - 1\\right) \\times \\left\\lceil \\log_{2}\\left(\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (k_i - 1)\\right) \\right\\rceil$$\n\n**Part 2: Explanation of Embedded Coordinate Routing**\n\nEmbedded coordinate routing, also known as algorithmic or source routing, fundamentally changes the routing paradigm from table lookup to on-the-fly computation. This dramatically reduces storage requirements.\n\nInstead of pre-computing and storing the next hop for all possible destinations, a router with embedded coordinate routing capability performs a simple computation upon packet arrival. The process is as follows:\n1.  A packet arrives at an intermediate router, carrying the destination coordinate $\\mathbf{y}=(y_{0}, y_{1}, \\dots, y_{n-1})$ in its header.\n2.  The router has its own coordinate, $\\mathbf{x}=(x_{0}, x_{1}, \\dots, x_{n-1})$, stored locally in a register.\n3.  The routing logic compares $\\mathbf{x}$ and $\\mathbf{y}$ coordinate by coordinate to find the set of dimensions $D = \\{i \\mid x_{i} \\neq y_{i}\\}$. These are the dimensions along which the packet still needs to travel.\n4.  The deterministic minimal routing rule is implemented as a simple selection algorithm on the set $D$. For example, a common implementation is dimension-order routing (DOR), which selects the dimension $j = \\min(D)$.\n5.  Once the dimension $j$ is chosen, the router directs the packet to the output port corresponding to the destination's coordinate value $y_j$ within dimension group $j$. Since there is a direct link to every other node in that dimension, this selection is unambiguous.\n\nThe storage requirement for this scheme is drastically reduced. The enormous table of size $O(N)$, where $N$ is the total number of nodes in the network, is completely eliminated. The only routing-related information that needs to be stored at the router is its own coordinate $\\mathbf{x}$. The storage for this coordinate is $\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \\lceil \\log_{2}(k_i) \\rceil$ bits. This storage cost is independent of the total network size $N$ and depends only on the local parameters $n$ and $k_i$.\n\nThe phrase \"reduce table storage to $O(1)$ per port\" is a way to express this efficiency. The table storage, which is the dominant cost in the baseline scheme, becomes zero. The residual storage (the router's coordinate) is a fixed overhead for the router. When this small, constant cost is amortized over the $r_{\\mathrm{net}}$ ports of the router, the storage cost \"per port\" becomes very small and, crucially, does not scale with the total network size $N$. It is constant with respect to $N$, hence the $O(1)$ characterization in that context. This trade-off of a very large memory (the table) for a small amount of computational logic is a cornerstone of scalable NoC design.",

Links connect nearest neighbors bidirectionally, and deterministic dimension-order (also called $XY$) routing is used: packets first traverse the $x$-dimension to reach the correct column, then traverse the $y$-dimension to reach the correct row. Each link is modeled as an independent $M/M/1$ queue with service rate $\\mu$ (in flits per cycle). Packets are wormhole routed, and for this problem the expected end-to-end latency of a packet is the sum of the expected sojourn times over the links along its path.\n\nYou are given a constructed traffic matrix that induces a single congested horizontal link on row $y=0$ between columns $x=1$ and $x=2$, denoted $(0,1)\\leftrightarrow(0,2)$, while keeping all other links at a uniform base load. Specifically:\n- There is a uniform, low-intensity background all-to-all traffic such that, after $XY$ routing, every link in the network receives an average exogenous arrival rate equal to $\\lambda_{0}$ (in flits per cycle). Assume $0 \\le \\lambda_{0} < \\mu$.\n- In addition, there are two high-rate entries in the traffic matrix:\n  - From source $(0,1)$ to destination $(0,2)$ with offered rate $a$ (in flits per cycle).\n  - From source $(0,1)$ to destination $(0,3)$ with offered rate $b$ (in flits per cycle).\n  Under $XY$ routing, both of these flows traverse the link $(0,1)\\rightarrow(0,2)$, so the total arrival rate on that directed link is $\\lambda_{c}=\\lambda_{0}+a+b$. Assume $0 \\le \\lambda_{c} < \\mu$. All other links remain at arrival rate $\\lambda_{0}$ due to the background traffic alone. The bidirectional nature of links is irrelevant here; consider the direction $(0,1)\\rightarrow(0,2)$ as the congested direction.\n\nConsider a test flow with infinitesimal injection rate (so it does not perturb the queueing loads) from source $(0,0)$ to destination $(0,3)$. Under $XY$ routing, the minimal path (three hops along row $y=0$) is $(0,0)\\rightarrow(0,1)\\rightarrow(0,2)\\rightarrow(0,3)$, which includes the congested link $(0,1)\\rightarrow(0,2)$. A particular non-minimal path that avoids this congested link is to detour one row down and come back up: $(0,0)\\rightarrow(0,1)\\rightarrow(1,1)\\rightarrow(1,2)\\rightarrow(0,2)\\rightarrow(0,3)$, which has two extra hops compared to the minimal path and, by construction, places the packet only on links with arrival rate $\\lambda_{0}$.\n\nUsing only well-tested queueing results for $M/M/1$ queues and linearity of expected values over a fixed path, do the following:\n1.

This is a direct application of the linearity of expectation.\n\nWe will analyze the two paths for the test flow from source $S=(0,0)$ to destination $D=(0,3)$.\n\nFirst, consider the minimal path dictated by deterministic $XY$ routing, which we shall denote as Path $1$.\nPath $1$: $(0,0) \\rightarrow (0,1) \\rightarrow (0,2) \\rightarrow (0,3)$.\nThis path is composed of $3$ hops. We must determine the arrival rate for each of the $3$ links traversed:\n1.  Link $(0,0) \\rightarrow (0,1)$: This link is not the specified congested link.

Link $(0,2) \\rightarrow (0,3)$: This is another uncongested link, with an arrival rate of $\\lambda_{0}$.\n\nThe total expected latency for Path $1$, denoted $L_1$, is the sum of the expected sojourn times on these three links:\n$$L_1 = E[T_{(0,0) \\rightarrow (0,1)}] + E[T_{(0,1) \\rightarrow (0,2)}] + E[T_{(0,2) \\rightarrow (0,3)}]$$\n$$L_1 = \\frac{1}{\\mu - \\lambda_{0}} + \\frac{1}{\\mu - \\lambda_{c}} + \\frac{1}{\\mu - \\lambda_{0}}$$\n$$L_1 = \\frac{2}{\\mu - \\lambda_{0}} + \\frac{1}{\\mu - \\lambda_{c}}$$\n\nNext, consider the non-minimal detour path, which we shall denote as Path $2$.\nPath $2$: $(0,0) \\rightarrow (0,1) \\rightarrow (1,1) \\rightarrow (1,2) \\rightarrow (0,2) \\rightarrow (0,3)$.\nThis path is composed of $5$ hops.

Show that there exists a congestion level on the congested link above which the non-minimal detour is faster.\nThe non-minimal path (Path $2$) has a lower expected delay than the minimal path (Path $1$) if $L_2 < L_1$.\n$$\\frac{5}{\\mu - \\lambda_{0}} < \\frac{2}{\\mu - \\lambda_{0}} + \\frac{1}{\\mu - \\lambda_{c}}$$\nThis inequality depends on the value of $\\lambda_{c}$. Let's analyze the behavior of the two latencies. $L_2$ is a constant value with respect to $\\lambda_{c}$, as it only depends on $\\mu$ and $\\lambda_{0}$. In contrast, $L_1$ is a strictly increasing function of $\\lambda_{c}$ over the valid domain $[0, \\mu)$. As the congestion level $\\lambda_{c}$ increases and approaches the service rate $\\mu$, the term $\\mu - \\lambda_{c}$ approaches $0$ from the positive side, causing the term $\\frac{1}{\\mu - \\lambda_{c}}$ to increase without bound. Consequently, $L_1$ also increases without bound.\nAt the lowest possible congestion level for the specified link, where $\\lambda_c = \\lambda_0$ (corresponding to $a+b=0$), the latency of the minimal path is:\n$$L_1(\\lambda_c = \\lambda_0) = \\frac{2}{\\mu - \\lambda_{0}} + \\frac{1}{\\mu - \\lambda_{0}} = \\frac{3}{\\mu - \\lambda_{0}}$$\nIn this case, $L_1 = \\frac{3}{\\mu - \\lambda_{0}} < \\frac{5}{\\mu - \\lambda_{0}} = L_2$, so the minimal path is faster, as expected.\nHowever, since $L_1$ grows monotonically and unboundedly with $\\lambda_{c}$ while $L_2$ remains constant, there must exist a value of $\\lambda_{c}$ where $L_1$ surpasses $L_2$. This confirms that for sufficiently high congestion levels, the non-minimal path will indeed yield a strictly lower expected delay.\n\n2.  Compute the exact threshold value $\\lambda_{c}^{\\star}$.\nThe threshold $\\lambda_{c}^{\\star}$ is the specific value of the congested link's arrival rate at which the expected latencies of the two paths are equal, i.e., $L_1 = L_2$. For any $\\lambda_c > \\lambda_c^{\\star}$, we will have $L_1 > L_2$.\nSetting the two latency expressions equal:\n$$\\frac{2}{\\mu - \\lambda_{0}} + \\frac{1}{\\mu - \\lambda_{c}^{\\star}} = \\frac{5}{\\mu - \\lambda_{0}}$$\nTo solve for $\\lambda_{c}^{\\star}$, we first isolate the term containing it:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\mu - \\lambda_{c}^{\\star}} = \\frac{5}{\\mu - \\lambda_{0}} - \\frac{2}{\\mu - \\lambda_{0}}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{\\mu - \\lambda_{c}^{\\star}} = \\frac{3}{\\mu - \\lambda_{0}}$$\nNow, we take the reciprocal of both sides of the equation:\n$$\\mu - \\lambda_{c}^{\\star} = \\frac{\\mu - \\lambda_{0}}{3}$$\nFinally, we solve for $\\lambda_{c}^{\\star}$:\n$$\\lambda_{c}^{\\star} = \\mu - \\frac{\\mu - \\lambda_{0}}{3}$$\nCombining the terms on the right-hand side gives the final closed-form expression:\n$$\\lambda_{c}^{\\star} = \\frac{3\\mu - (\\mu - \\lambda_{0})}{3} = \\frac{3\\mu - \\mu + \\lambda_{0}}{3}$$\n$$\\lambda_{c}^{\\star} = \\frac{2\\mu + \\lambda_{0}}{3}$$\nThis is the threshold arrival rate on the congested link. For any $\\lambda_c > \\lambda_{c}^{\\star}$, the non-minimal path becomes the preferable choice in terms of expected latency. The condition $\\lambda_c < \\lambda_c^{\\star}$ implies the minimal path is faster, and at $\\lambda_c = \\lambda_c^{\\star}$ both paths have identical expected latency.",
