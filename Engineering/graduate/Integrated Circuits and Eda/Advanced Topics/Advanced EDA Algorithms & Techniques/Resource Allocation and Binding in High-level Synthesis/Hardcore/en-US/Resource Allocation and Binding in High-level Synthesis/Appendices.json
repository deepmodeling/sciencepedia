The operation's result is available at time $S_i + L_i$. For an operation $v_j$ that depends on the output of $v_i$, its start time must satisfy the constraint $S_j \\ge S_i + L_i$.\n\nThe latencies for the operations are:\n$L_1=2$, $L_2=2$, $L_3=1$, $L_4=1$, $L_5=1$, $L_6=2$, $L_7=1$, $L_8=1$, $L_9=1$.\n\n**1. As Soon As Possible (ASAP) Scheduling**\n\nThe ASAP start time, $S_{A,i}$, is the earliest possible time an operation $v_i$ can begin. For an operation with no predecessors, the start time is $0$. For others, it is determined by the completion times of its predecessors.\nThe governing equation is:\n$$S_{A,i} = \\max_{v_j \\in \\text{Pred}(v_i)} \\{ S_{A,j} + L_j \\}$$\nIf $\\text{Pred}(v_i)$ is empty, $S_{A,i} = 0$.\n\n-   $S_{A,1} = 0$\n-   $S_{A,2} = 0$\n-   $S_{A,3} = \\max(S_{A,1} + L_1, S_{A,2} + L_2) = \\max(0+2, 0+2) = 2$\n-   $S_{A,4} = S_{A,2} + L_2 = 0 + 2 = 2$\n-   $S_{A,5} = \\max(S_{A,3} + L_3, S_{A,4} + L_4) = \\max(2+1, 2+1) = 3$\n-   $S_{A,6} = S_{A,5} + L_5 = 3 + 1 = 4$\n-   $S_{A,7} = S_{A,3} + L_3 = 2 + 1 = 3$\n-   $S_{A,8} = S_{A,7} + L_7 = 3 + 1 = 4$\n-   $S_{A,9} = \\max(S_{A,6} + L_6, S_{A,8} + L_8) = \\max(4+2, 4+1) = \\max(6, 5) = 6$\n\nThe critical path length is the completion time of the final operation in the ASAP schedule, which is $T_{crit} = S_{A,9} + L_9 = 6 + 1 = 7$ cycles.\n\n**2. As Late As Possible (ALAP) Scheduling**\n\nThe ALAP start time, $S_{L,i}$, is the latest possible time an operation $v_i$ can begin without violating the total required time, $T_{\\text{req}}$. We work backward from the sink node(s). The completion time of the final operation $v_9$ must be no later than $T_{\\text{req}}$. Thus, $S_{L,9} + L_9 \\le T_{\\text{req}}$. For the latest schedule, we set $S_{L,9} + L_9 = T_{\\text{req}}$.\nThe governing equation is:\n$$S_{L,i} = \\min_{v_j \\in \\text{Succ}(v_i)} \\{ S_{L,j} \\} - L_i$$\n-   For $v_9$, $S_{L,9} = T_{\\text{req}} - L_9 = 9 - 1 = 8$.\n-   $v_8$ is a predecessor to $v_9$: $S_{L,8} = S_{L,9} - L_8 = 8 - 1 = 7$.\n-   $v_7$ is a predecessor to $v_8$: $S_{L,7} = S_{L,8} - L_7 = 7 - 1 = 6$.\n-   $v_6$ is a predecessor to $v_9$: $S_{L,6} = S_{L,9} - L_6 = 8 - 2 = 6$.\n-   $v_5$ is a predecessor to $v_6$: $S_{L,5} = S_{L,6} - L_5 = 6 - 1 = 5$.\n-   $v_4$ is a predecessor to $v_5$: $S_{L,4} = S_{L,5} - L_4 = 5 - 1 = 4$.\n-   $v_3$ has successors $\\{v_5, v_7\\}$: $S_{L,3} = \\min(S_{L,5}, S_{L,7}) - L_3 = \\min(5, 6) - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4$.\n-   $v_2$ has successors $\\{v_3, v_4\\}$: $S_{L,2} = \\min(S_{L,3}, S_{L,4}) - L_2 = \\min(4, 4) - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2$.\n-   $v_1$ is a predecessor to $v_3$: $S_{L,1} = S_{L,3} - L_1 = 4 - 2 = 2$.\n\n**3. Mobility Calculation**\n\nThe mobility of an operation $v_i$, denoted $m_i$, is the range of cycles in which it can be scheduled. It is calculated as the difference between its ALAP and ASAP start times: $m_i = S_{L,i} - S_{A,i}$.\n\n-   $m_1 = S_{L,1} - S_{A,1} = 2 - 0 = 2$\n-   $m_2 = S_{L,2} - S_{A,2} = 2 - 0 = 2$\n-   $m_3 = S_{L,3} - S_{A,3} = 4 - 2 = 2$\n-   $m_4 = S_{L,4} - S_{A,4} = 4 - 2 = 2$\n-   $m_5 = S_{L,5} - S_{A,5} = 5 - 3 = 2$\n-   $m_6 = S_{L,6} - S_{A,6} = 6 - 4 = 2$\n-   $m_7 = S_{L,7} - S_{A,7} = 6 - 3 = 3$\n-   $m_8 = S_{L,8} - S_{A,8} = 7 - 4 = 3$\n-   $m_9 = S_{L,9} - S_{A,9} = 8 - 6 = 2$\n\n**4. Total Mobility Calculation**\n\nThe total mobility $M$ is the sum of the individual mobilities for all operations in the DFG.\n$$M = \\sum_{i=1}^{9} m_i$$\n$$M = m_1 + m_2 + m_3 + m_4 + m_5 + m_6 + m_7 + m_8 + m_9$$\n$$M = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 2$$\n$$M = (7 \\times 2) + (2 \\times 3) = 14 + 6 = 20$$\nThe total mobility for the given DFG is $20$ cycles.",

As part of your derivation, justify how at least one pair of operations from the given set can share a single adder without overlap. Express the final answer as the minimum integer number of adders required. No rounding is needed, and all times are expressed in cycles.",
            "solution": "The core of the problem is to determine the minimum number of functional units (adders) required to implement a given set of operations with a fixed schedule. This is a classic resource allocation problem. The minimum number of resources is dictated by the maximum number of operations that must be executed concurrently.\n\nFirst, we must define the resource occupancy for each operation. The problem states that each addition is performed on a non-pipelined adder with a latency of $L = 3$ clock cycles. For an operation with a start time $t_{start}$, a non-pipelined resource is occupied for the entire duration of the operation. This means the resource is busy for $L$ consecutive clock cycles, starting from cycle $t_{start}$. The resource occupancy can be represented by a time interval. If an operation starts at clock cycle $t_i$, it occupies an adder for cycles $t_i$, $t_i+1$, and $t_i+2$. This corresponds to the continuous time interval $[t_i, t_i+L)$, which for this problem is $[t_i, t_i+3)$.\n\nThe given set of start times for the $9$ addition operations is $T = \\{\\,0,\\,2,\\,3,\\,5,\\,6,\\,7,\\,9,\\,10,\\,12\\,\\}$. We can list the occupancy interval for each operation:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Operation 1: start time $t_1 = 0$, occupancy interval $I_1 = [0, 0+3) = [0, 3)$.\n    \\item Operation 2: start time $t_2 = 2$, occupancy interval $I_2 = [2, 2+3) = [2, 5)$.\n    \\item Operation 3: start time $t_3 = 3$, occupancy interval $I_3 = [3, 3+3) = [3, 6)$.\n    \\item Operation 4: start time $t_4 = 5$, occupancy interval $I_4 = [5, 5+3) = [5, 8)$.\n    \\item Operation 5: start time $t_5 = 6$, occupancy interval $I_5 = [6, 6+3) = [6, 9)$.\n    \\item Operation 6: start time $t_6 = 7$, occupancy interval $I_6 = [7, 7+3) = [7, 10)$.\n    \\item Operation 7: start time $t_7 = 9$, occupancy interval $I_7 = [9, 9+3) = [9, 12)$.\n    \\item Operation 8: start time $t_8 = 10$, occupancy interval $I_8 = [10, 10+3) = [10, 13)$.\n    \\item Operation 9: start time $t_9 = 12$, occupancy interval $I_9 = [12, 12+3) = [12, 15)$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nTwo operations create a resource conflict if their occupancy intervals overlap. The minimum number of adders required is equal to the maximum number of overlapping intervals at any single point in time. This is also known as the size of the maximum clique in the interval graph corresponding to these operations.\n\nTo find this maximum overlap, we can analyze the number of active operations over time. Let $N(t)$ be the number of active operations at time $t$. We need to find $\\max_{t} N(t)$. The value of $N(t)$ changes only at the start or end times of the intervals. We can check the number of active operations in the time slots defined by these start and end points.\n\nA more direct approach is to identify the point of maximum concurrency. Let's examine the intervals:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item At $t = 2.5$: Intervals $I_1 = [0, 3)$ and $I_2 = [2, 5)$ overlap. $N(2.5) = 2$.\n    \\item At $t = 3.5$: Intervals $I_2 = [2, 5)$ and $I_3 = [3, 6)$ overlap. $N(3.5) = 2$.\n    \\item At $t = 5.5$: Intervals $I_3 = [3, 6)$ and $I_4 = [5, 8)$ overlap. $N(5.5) = 2$.\n    \\item At $t = 6.5$: Intervals $I_4 = [5, 8)$ and $I_5 = [6, 9)$ overlap. $N(6.5) = 2$.\n    \\item At $t = 7.5$: Intervals $I_4 = [5, 8)$, $I_5 = [6, 9)$, and $I_6 = [7, 10)$ all overlap. For any time $t$ in the interval $[7, 8)$, all three of these operations are concurrently active. For example, at $t=7$, operation $4$ is in its third cycle, operation $5$ is in its second cycle, and operation $6$ is in its first cycle. Thus, $N(7.5) = 3$.\n    \\item At $t = 8.5$: Intervals $I_5 = [6, 9)$ and $I_6 = [7, 10)$ overlap. $N(8.5) = 2$.\n    \\item At $t = 9.5$: Intervals $I_6 = [7, 10)$ and $I_7 = [9, 12)$ overlap. $N(9.5) = 2$.\n    \\item At $t = 10.5$: Intervals $I_7 = [9, 12)$ and $I_8 = [10, 13)$ overlap. $N(10.5) = 2$.\n    \\item At $t = 12.5$: Intervals $I_8 = [10, 13)$ and $I_9 = [12, 15)$ overlap. $N(12.5) = 2$.\n\\end{itemize}\nThe maximum number of concurrent operations observed is $3$, occurring in the time interval $[7, 8)$. This peak concurrency requires three distinct adder units to be available simultaneously. Therefore, the minimum number of adders required is $3$.\n\nThe problem also requires justification that at least one pair of operations can share a single adder. According to the binding constraint, this is possible if their resource occupancy intervals do not overlap. Let's consider Operation 1 (start time $t_1=0$) and Operation 3 (start time $t_3=3$).\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item The occupancy interval for Operation 1 is $I_1 = [0, 3)$. The adder is occupied during cycles $0$, $1$, and $2$. It becomes free at the beginning of cycle $3$.\n    \\item The occupancy interval for Operation 3 is $I_3 = [3, 6)$. The operation requires an adder starting from cycle $3$.\n\\end{itemize}\nSince the interval $I_1$ ends at time $t=3$ and the interval $I_3$ begins at time $t=3$, their intervals $[0, 3)$ and $[3, 6)$ are disjoint (they only touch at a boundary point, which does not constitute an overlap in this context of discrete clock cycles and occupancy intervals defined as $[start, end)$). Thus, a single adder can execute Operation 1 and then, immediately upon its completion, execute Operation 3. This demonstrates valid resource sharing.\n\nBased on the analysis of maximum concurrency, the minimum number of adders is determined by the peak requirement. The peak requirement is 3 adders.",
