            "problem": "Consider a clock distribution net synthesized by Deferred-Merge Embedding (DME) in Electronic Design Automation (EDA). The interconnect is modeled as a resistive-capacitive tree: each wire segment of length $L$ has per-unit resistance $r$ and per-unit capacitance $c$, so its lumped resistance is $rL$ and its lumped capacitance is $cL$. Each sink is modeled by a lumped load capacitance at its pin. The source is an ideal step with negligible output resistance. This net has two sinks, labeled $A$ and $B$, that diverge from a single merge point. The path from the source to the merge point (the trunk) is rectilinear and consists of $m$ contiguous segments with lengths $\\{T_{1}, T_{2}, \\dots, T_{m}\\}$. From the merge point, the branch to sink $A$ consists of $n$ contiguous segments with lengths $\\{A_{1}, A_{2}, \\dots, A_{n}\\}$ terminating at a lumped sink capacitance $C_{A}$. Similarly, the branch to sink $B$ consists of $p$ contiguous segments with lengths $\\{B_{1}, B_{2}, \\dots, B_{p}\\}$ terminating at a lumped sink capacitance $C_{B}$.\n\nStarting from the first principles of linear time-invariant resistive-capacitive networks and the definition of Elmore delay as the first moment of the impulse response for a tree network, do the following:\n\n- Formalize the clock skew between sinks $A$ and $B$ as the difference of their arrival times under the Elmore delay model.\n- Derive a general analytic expression for the Elmore arrival time at the end of a single path composed of contiguous segments with lengths $\\{L_{1}, L_{2}, \\dots, L_{N}\\}$ and a lumped load capacitance $C_{\\text{sink}}$ at its end, in terms of $r$, $c$, and the segment lengths.\n\nAssume that there is no coupling between branches except at the merge point, and that wire parameters $r$ and $c$ are spatially uniform. Express your final answer as two closed-form expressions: the path-arrival time for the sequence $\\{L_{i}\\}$ and the skew between sinks $A$ and $B$ constructed from their branch sequences $\\{A_{i}\\}$ and $\\{B_{i}\\}$ and loads $C_{A}$ and $C_{B}$. No numerical evaluation is required. If you choose to include the trunk in intermediate reasoning, ensure any common-mode contributions that do not affect skew are treated correctly in the final expression. The final answer must be a single analytic expression or a single row matrix of analytic expressions, with no units attached.",
            "solution": "The Elmore delay, $\\tau_D$, at a particular node $i$ in a resistive-capacitive (RC) tree is the first moment of the impulse response at that node. For a tree network driven by a step voltage source at the root (node $0$), the Elmore delay at node $i$ is given by the expression:\n$$ \\tau_i = \\sum_{k} R_k C_{downstream(k)} $$\nwhere the sum is taken over all resistors $R_k$ on the unique path from the source to node $i$, and $C_{downstream(k)}$ is the total capacitance of the subtree connected downstream of resistor $R_k$.\n\nFirst, we derive the general expression for the Elmore arrival time at the end of a single path.\nConsider a single path composed of $N$ contiguous segments with lengths $\\{L_{1}, L_{2}, \\dots, L_{N}\\}$, per-unit resistance $r$, per-unit capacitance $c$, and a lumped load capacitance $C_{\\text{sink}}$ at its terminus. We model each segment $k$ (for $k=1, \\dots, N$) as an L-model, which consists of a series resistor $R_k = rL_k$ followed by a shunt capacitor $C_k = cL_k$ to ground. The path is a ladder network of these L-sections. Let the nodes be numbered $v_0, v_1, \\dots, v_N$, where $v_0$ is the source and $v_N$ is the sink. Resistor $R_k$ connects node $v_{k-1}$ to node $v_k$, and capacitor $C_k$ is connected at node $v_k$. The load $C_{\\text{sink}}$ is also at node $v_N$.\n\nThe unique path from the source $v_0$ to the sink $v_N$ comprises the resistors $R_1, R_2, \\dots, R_N$. The Elmore arrival time at the sink, which we denote $T_{\\text{path}}$, is:\n$$ T_{\\text{path}} = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} R_k C_{downstream(k)} $$\nThe resistor $R_k$ is on the segment connecting $v_{k-1}$ to $v_k$. The downstream capacitance $C_{downstream(k)}$ is the sum of all capacitances connected at or after node $v_k$. This includes the wire capacitances of segments $k, k+1, \\dots, N$ and the final load capacitance $C_{\\text{sink}}$.\n$$ C_{downstream(k)} = \\left(\\sum_{j=k}^{N} C_j\\right) + C_{\\text{sink}} = \\left(\\sum_{j=k}^{N} cL_j\\right) + C_{\\text{sink}} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $R_k$ and $C_{downstream(k)}$ into the delay formula:\n$$ T_{\\text{path}} = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} (rL_k) \\left( c\\sum_{j=k}^{N} L_j + C_{\\text{sink}} \\right) $$\nWe can separate this into two terms:\n$$ T_{\\text{path}} = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} rcL_k \\left(\\sum_{j=k}^{N} L_j\\right) + \\sum_{k=1}^{N} rL_k C_{\\text{sink}} $$\nFactoring out the constants $r$, $c$, and $C_{\\text{sink}}$ gives the final expression for the path-arrival time:\n$$ T_{\\text{path}}(\\{L_k\\}_{k=1}^N, C_{\\text{sink}}) = r C_{\\text{sink}} \\sum_{k=1}^{N} L_k + rc \\sum_{k=1}^{N} L_k \\sum_{j=k}^{N} L_j $$\nThis is the first required expression.\n\nNext, we derive the clock skew between sinks $A$ and $B$. The skew, $S_{AB}$, is the difference in their arrival times, $\\tau_A - \\tau_B$.\nThe path to sink $A$ consists of the trunk segments $\\{T_1, \\dots, T_m\\}$ followed by branch $A$ segments $\\{A_1, \\dots, A_n\\}$. Similarly, the path to sink $B$ consists of the same trunk segments followed by branch $B$ segments $\\{B_1, \\dots, B_p\\}$. The merge point is the common node where branches $A$ and $B$ diverge.\n\nThe arrival time at sink $A$, $\\tau_A$, is the sum of delay contributions from all resistors on its path from the source:\n$$ \\tau_A = \\sum_{k=1}^{m} R_{T,k} C_{downstream(T,k)} + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} R_{A,i} C_{downstream(A,i)} $$\nSimilarly, for sink $B$:\n$$ \\tau_B = \\sum_{k=1}^{m} R_{T,k} C_{downstream(T,k)} + \\sum_{j=1}^{p} R_{B,j} C_{downstream(B,j)} $$\nThe first term, $\\tau_{\\text{Trunk}} = \\sum_{k=1}^{m} R_{T,k} C_{downstream(T,k)}$, is the delay contribution from the trunk resistors. For any resistor $R_{T,k}$ on the trunk path, its downstream capacitance includes the capacitances of the rest of the trunk, plus the entire capacitance of branch $A$ (wires and sink load $C_A$), plus the entire capacitance of branch $B$ (wires and sink load $C_B$). This downstream capacitance is identical whether we are calculating the delay to sink $A$ or sink $B$. Therefore, the trunk contribution $\\tau_{\\text{Trunk}}$ is common to both $\\tau_A$ and $\\tau_B$.\n\nThe skew is then:\n$$ S_{AB} = \\tau_A - \\tau_B = \\left(\\tau_{\\text{Trunk}} + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} R_{A,i} C_{downstream(A,i)}\\right) - \\left(\\tau_{\\text{Trunk}} + \\sum_{j=1}^{p} R_{B,j} C_{downstream(B,j)}\\right) $$\n$$ S_{AB} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} R_{A,i} C_{downstream(A,i)} - \\sum_{j=1}^{p} R_{B,j} C_{downstream(B,j)} $$\nThe term $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} R_{A,i} C_{downstream(A,i)}$ represents the Elmore delay from the merge point to sink $A$. For a resistor $R_{A,i}$ on branch $A$, its downstream capacitance consists only of the subsequent parts of branch $A$ and the load $C_A$. This is equivalent to calculating the delay of branch $A$ as an isolated path, with the merge point acting as the source.\n\nThus, we can use the path-arrival time expression derived earlier for each branch. Let $\\tau_{\\text{branchA}}$ be the delay of branch A and $\\tau_{\\text{branchB}}$ be the delay of branch B, both calculated from the merge point.\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{branchA}} = T_{\\text{path}}(\\{A_k\\}_{k=1}^n, C_A) = r C_A \\sum_{k=1}^{n} A_k + rc \\sum_{k=1}^{n} A_k \\sum_{j=k}^{n} A_j $$\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{branchB}} = T_{\\text{path}}(\\{B_k\\}_{k=1}^p, C_B) = r C_B \\sum_{k=1}^{p} B_k + rc \\sum_{k=1}^{p} B_k \\sum_{j=k}^{p} B_j $$\nThe skew is the difference between these two branch delays:\n$$ S_{AB} = \\tau_{\\text{branchA}} - \\tau_{\\text{branchB}} $$\n$$ S_{AB} = \\left(r C_A \\sum_{k=1}^{n} A_k + rc \\sum_{k=1}^{n} A_k \\sum_{j=k}^{n} A_j\\right) - \\left(r C_B \\sum_{k=1}^{p} B_k + rc \\sum_{k=1}^{p} B_k \\sum_{j=k}^{p} B_j\\right) $$\nThis is the second required expression.",

A zero-skew tree requires equal path lengths from the root to all sinks. The DME method constructs feasible regions (merging segments) for Steiner points that equalize path lengths from a parent to two children while deferring the exact embedding to optimize total wirelength.\n\nDefinition of rectilinear distance: for two points $(x_{a}, y_{a})$ and $(x_{b}, y_{b})$, the Manhattan distance is $|x_{a} - x_{b}| + |y_{a} - y_{b}|$.\n\nStep 1: Geometric matching to determine the merge order.\nWe compute pairwise rectilinear distances and select nearest-neighbor pairs to form the first level of merges.\n\n- Distance between $s_{1} = (0, 0)$ and $s_{2} = (4, 0)$:\n$$d_{12} = |0 - 4| + |0 - 0| = 4.$$\n\n- Distance between $s_{3} = (9, 1)$ and $s_{4} = (9, 5)$:\n$$d_{34} = |9 - 9| + |1 - 5| = 4.$$\n\nWe briefly check cross-pair distances to confirm that these are indeed nearest neighbor matches:\n- $d(s_{1}, s_{3}) = |0 - 9| + |0 - 1| = 10.$\n- $d(s_{1}, s_{4}) = |0 - 9| + |0 - 5| = 14.$\n- $d(s_{2}, s_{3}) = |4 - 9| + |0 - 1| = 6.$\n- $d(s_{2}, s_{4}) = |4 - 9| + |0 - 5| = 10.$\n\nThus, geometric matching yields first-level pairs $(s_{1}, s_{2})$ and $(s_{3}, s_{4})$.\n\nStep 2: Compute the merging segments for each first-level pair.\nFor two children at $(x_{1}, y_{1})$ and $(x_{2}, y_{2})$, the zero-skew locus in the interior of their axis-aligned bounding box is the set of points $(x, y)$ satisfying\n$$|x - x_{1}| + |y - y_{1}| = |x - x_{2}| + |y - y_{2}|.$$\nWhen $(x, y)$ lies within the bounding box $[ \\min(x_{1}, x_{2}), \\max(x_{1}, x_{2}) ] \\times [ \\min(y_{1}, y_{2}), \\max(y_{1}, y_{2}) ]$, the absolute values resolve linearly and the equality reduces to\n$$x + y = \\frac{x_{1} + y_{1} + x_{2} + y_{2}}{2}.$$\nThe merging segment is the portion of this line inside the bounding box, which may degenerate to a point when the box dimension in either axis is zero.\n\n- Pair $(s_{1}, s_{2})$: $(x_{1}, y_{1}) = (0, 0)$ and $(x_{2}, y_{2}) = (4, 0)$.
