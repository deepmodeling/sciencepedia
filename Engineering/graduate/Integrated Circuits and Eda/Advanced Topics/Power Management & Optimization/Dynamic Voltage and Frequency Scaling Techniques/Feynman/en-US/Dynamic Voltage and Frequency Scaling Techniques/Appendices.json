            "problem": "Consider a digital core implemented in Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) and controlled through Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS), which is widely used in Electronic Design Automation (EDA) flows. Assume the dynamic (switching) power is given by $P_{\\mathrm{dyn}}=\\alpha_{\\mathrm{sw}}\\,C\\,V^{2}\\,f$, where $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{sw}}$ is the switching activity factor, $C$ is the effective switched capacitance, $V$ is the supply voltage, and $f$ is the clock frequency. Further assume a standard voltage–frequency relation $f=k\\,(V-V_{T})^{m}$ for $V>V_{T}$, where $V_{T}$ is the effective threshold voltage, $k>0$ is a technology-dependent constant, and $m>0$ is an empirically observed exponent parameterizing how delay scales with supply voltage above threshold. Neglect leakage and short-circuit power. \n\nOver a fixed time horizon $T>0$, the system must complete a fixed work amount $W>0$ measured in required clock cycles, which imposes the constraint $\\int_{0}^{T}f\\!\\left(t\\right)\\,dt=W$. DVFS sets $V\\!\\left(t\\right)$ and thus $f\\!\\left(t\\right)$ over time, with the energy $E=\\int_{0}^{T}P_{\\mathrm{dyn}}\\!\\left(t\\right)\\,dt$. Assume feasibility, i.e., there exists $V\\!\\left(t\\right)\\geq V_{T}$ for which the constraint can be satisfied over $[0,T]$.\n\nStarting only from the definitions above, derive the optimal stationary operating point that minimizes the energy subject to the fixed-work, fixed-horizon constraint.

No numerical rounding is required and no units need to be provided in the final pair.",
            "solution": "The problem is to find the optimal stationary operating point, characterized by a constant frequency $f^{*}$ and a constant voltage $V^{*}$, that minimizes the total energy $E$ required to complete a fixed amount of work $W$ within a fixed time horizon $T$. The solution proceeds in three steps as prompted: first, we establish the convexity of the power-frequency relationship; second, we use this convexity to prove that a constant frequency schedule is optimal; and third, we compute the specific values for the optimal frequency and voltage.\n\nFirst, we must express the dynamic power $P_{\\mathrm{dyn}}$ as a function of frequency $f$. The given relations are:\n$P_{\\mathrm{dyn}} = \\alpha_{\\mathrm{sw}}\\,C\\,V^{2}\\,f$\n$f = k\\,(V-V_{T})^{m}$ for $V > V_{T}$\n\nFrom the second equation, we solve for the voltage $V$ as a function of frequency $f$. Since $f > 0$ (as $V > V_T$) and $k>0$, we can write:\n$\\frac{f}{k} = (V-V_{T})^{m}$\n$\\left(\\frac{f}{k}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{m}} = V-V_{T}$\n$V(f) = V_{T} + \\left(\\frac{f}{k}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{m}}$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $V(f)$ into the equation for dynamic power gives $P_{\\mathrm{dyn}}$ as a function of $f$:\n$P_{\\mathrm{dyn}}(f) = \\alpha_{\\mathrm{sw}}\\,C\\,f\\,\\left(V_{T} + \\left(\\frac{f}{k}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{m}}\\right)^{2}$\n\nTo demonstrate that $P_{\\mathrm{dyn}}(f)$ is a convex function for $f \\ge 0$, we must show that its second derivative, $\\frac{d^{2}P_{\\mathrm{dyn}}}{df^{2}}$, is non-negative for $f \\ge 0$. Let's expand the expression for $P_{\\mathrm{dyn}}(f)$:\n$P_{\\mathrm{dyn}}(f) = \\alpha_{\\mathrm{sw}}\\,C\\,f\\,\\left(V_{T}^{2} + 2\\,V_{T}\\left(\\frac{f}{k}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{m}} + \\left(\\frac{f}{k}\\right)^{\\frac{2}{m}}\\right)$\n$P_{\\mathrm{dyn}}(f) = \\alpha_{\\mathrm{sw}}\\,C\\,\\left(V_{T}^{2}\\,f + 2\\,V_{T}\\,k^{-\\frac{1}{m}}\\,f^{1+\\frac{1}{m}} + k^{-\\frac{2}{m}}\\,f^{1+\\frac{2}{m}}\\right)$\n\nNow, we compute the first derivative with respect to $f$:\n$\\frac{dP_{\\mathrm{dyn}}}{df} = \\alpha_{\\mathrm{sw}}\\,C\\,\\left(V_{T}^{2} + 2\\,V_{T}\\,k^{-\\frac{1}{m}}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{m}\\right)f^{\\frac{1}{m}} + k^{-\\frac{2}{m}}\\left(1+\\frac{2}{m}\\right)f^{\\frac{2}{m}}\\right)$\n\nNext, we compute the second derivative:\n$\\frac{d^{2}P_{\\mathrm{dyn}}}{df^{2}} = \\alpha_{\\mathrm{sw}}\\,C\\,\\left(0 + 2\\,V_{T}\\,k^{-\\frac{1}{m}}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{m}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1}{m}\\right)f^{\\frac{1}{m}-1} + k^{-\\frac{2}{m}}\\left(1+\\frac{2}{m}\\right)\\left(\\frac{2}{m}\\right)f^{\\frac{2}{m}-1}\\right)$\n$\\frac{d^{2}P_{\\mathrm{dyn}}}{df^{2}} = \\alpha_{\\mathrm{sw}}\\,C\\,\\left( \\frac{2\\,V_{T}}{m\\,k^{\\frac{1}{m}}}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{m}\\right)f^{\\frac{1-m}{m}} + \\frac{2}{m\\,k^{\\frac{2}{m}}}\\left(1+\\frac{2}{m}\\right)f^{\\frac{2-m}{m}} \\right)$\n\nWe analyze the sign of this expression for $f>0$. The problem states that $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{sw}}>0$, $C>0$, $k>0$, $m>0$, and $V_{T}$ is the threshold voltage, which for physical CMOS devices is positive ($V_{T}>0$). Therefore, every factor in both terms of the sum is positive: $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{sw}}$, $C$, $2$, $m$, $k$, $V_{T}$, $(1+\\frac{1}{m})$, $(1+\\frac{2}{m})$. Since $f>0$, the terms $f^{\\frac{1-m}{m}}$ and $f^{\\frac{2-m}{m}}$ are also positive. Consequently, the entire expression for $\\frac{d^{2}P_{\\mathrm{dyn}}}{df^{2}}$ is positive for $f > 0$. This proves that $P_{\\mathrm{dyn}}(f)$ is a strictly convex function for $f>0$. As the function and its derivatives are continuous down to $f=0$, it is convex for $f \\ge 0$.\n\nSecond, we use this convexity to show that the optimal schedule is time-invariant. The total energy is $E = \\int_{0}^{T}P_{\\mathrm{dyn}}(f(t))\\,dt$, and the constraint is $\\int_{0}^{T}f(t)\\,dt=W$. We wish to minimize $E$ subject to this constraint.\nLet us define the average frequency over the time horizon $T$ as $\\bar{f} = \\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T}f(t)\\,dt$. From the constraint, we have $\\bar{f} = \\frac{W}{T}$.\nSince $P_{\\mathrm{dyn}}(f)$ is a convex function, we can apply Jensen's inequality for integrals, which states that for a convex function $\\phi$ and an integrable function $g(t)$ on $[a, b]$:\n$\\phi\\left(\\frac{1}{b-a}\\int_{a}^{b}g(t)\\,dt\\right) \\le \\frac{1}{b-a}\\int_{a}^{b}\\phi(g(t))\\,dt$\nApplying this to our problem with $\\phi=P_{\\mathrm{dyn}}$, $g(t)=f(t)$, and the interval $[0, T]$:\n$P_{\\mathrm{dyn}}\\left(\\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T}f(t)\\,dt\\right) \\le \\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T}P_{\\mathrm{dyn}}(f(t))\\,dt$\nSubstituting $\\bar{f} = \\frac{W}{T}$ and $E = \\int_{0}^{T}P_{\\mathrm{dyn}}(f(t))\\,dt$:\n$P_{\\mathrm{dyn}}\\left(\\frac{W}{T}\\right) \\le \\frac{E}{T}$\nThis can be rearranged to give a lower bound on the energy:\n$E \\ge T \\cdot P_{\\mathrm{dyn}}\\left(\\frac{W}{T}\\right)$\nThe term on the right, $T \\cdot P_{\\mathrm{dyn}}(\\frac{W}{T})$, represents the energy consumed if the frequency were held constant at the average value $\\frac{W}{T}$. The inequality shows that any time-varying frequency profile $f(t)$ will result in an energy consumption greater than or equal to this constant-frequency case. The minimum energy is achieved when the equality in Jensen's inequality holds, which occurs if and only if $f(t)$ is constant for all $t \\in [0, T]$. Therefore, the optimal frequency schedule is a constant frequency.\n\nThird, we compute the optimal constant frequency $f^{*}$ and its corresponding voltage $V^{*}$. From the reasoning above, the optimal strategy is to maintain a constant frequency $f(t) = f^{*}$ such that the work constraint is met.\n$\\int_{0}^{T} f^{*} \\,dt = f^{*} \\int_{0}^{T} dt = f^{*} T = W$\nSolving for $f^{*}$ gives:\n$f^{*} = \\frac{W}{T}$\n\nThis is the optimal constant frequency. To find the corresponding optimal constant voltage $V^{*}$, we use the voltage-frequency relationship $V(f) = V_{T} + (f/k)^{1/m}$ evaluated at $f=f^{*}$:\n$V^{*} = V_{T} + \\left(\\frac{f^{*}}{k}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{m}}$\nSubstituting the expression for $f^{*}$:\n$V^{*} = V_{T} + \\left(\\frac{W/T}{k}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{m}} = V_{T} + \\left(\\frac{W}{kT}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{m}}$\n\nThe resulting optimal stationary operating point is the pair $(f^{*}, V^{*})$. The condition $V^{*} > V_{T}$ is satisfied since $W, k, T, m$ are all positive, making the second term positive. This is consistent with the feasibility assumption.\nThe final analytical expressions are:\n$f^{*} = \\frac{W}{T}$\n$V^{*} = V_{T} + \\left(\\frac{W}{kT}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{m}}$",

There is no idle time.\nThus, the total energy consumed over the hyperperiod $H$ is the power at frequency $f_{\\text{opt}}$ multiplied by the duration $H$.\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = P(f_{\\text{opt}}) \\cdot H = (C_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\beta^{2} f_{\\text{opt}}^{3}) \\cdot H$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$C_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{F}$\n$\\beta = 2.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{V \\cdot s}$\n$f_{\\text{opt}} = 6.25 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$H = 60 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = (1.0 \\times 10^{-9}) \\cdot (2.0 \\times 10^{-9})^{2} \\cdot (6.25 \\times 10^{8})^{3} \\cdot (60 \\times 10^{-3})$$\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = (1.0 \\times 10^{-9}) \\cdot (4.0 \\times 10^{-18}) \\cdot (6.25^{3} \\times 10^{24}) \\cdot (60 \\times 10^{-3})$$\n$$6.25^{3} = 244.140625$$\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = (1.0 \\times 4.0 \\times 244.140625 \\times 60) \\times 10^{(-9 - 18 + 24 - 3)}$$\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = (976.5625 \\times 60) \\times 10^{-6}$$\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = 58593.75 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{J} = 0.05859375\\,\\mathrm{J}$$\nThe problem requires the answer in millijoules ($\\mathrm{mJ}$).\n$$1\\,\\mathrm{J} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{mJ}$$\n$$E_{\\text{total}} = 0.05859375 \\times 1000\\,\\mathrm{mJ} = 58.59375\\,\\mathrm{mJ}$$\nFinally, we round the result to four significant figures.\n$$E_{\\text{total}} \\approx 58.59\\,\\mathrm{mJ}$$\nThe DVFS schedule consists of maintaining a constant frequency of $6.25 \\times 10^8$ Hz and serving tasks as they are scheduled by EDF. The minimal dynamic energy is the value calculated above.",
