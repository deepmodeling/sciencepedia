            "problem": "A Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) structure consists of a thin gate oxide above the silicon film and a Buried Oxide (BOX) layer below the silicon film.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the capacitance per unit area for a parallel-plate capacitor structure and its application to a Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) device to find the ratio of the buried oxide capacitance to the gate oxide capacitance.\n\nFirst, we derive the general formula for the capacitance per unit area of a dielectric slab of thickness $t$ and permittivity $\\epsilon$ situated between two parallel conducting plates. The problem specifies a large-area region, which justifies modeling this as a parallel-plate capacitor and neglecting fringing fields.\n\nLet the two conducting plates be located at positions $z=0$ and $z=t$. A potential difference $V$ is applied across the plates, inducing a uniform surface charge density $+\\sigma$ on one plate and $-\\sigma$ on the other. By convention, let the plate at $z=t$ have charge density $+\\sigma$ and the plate at $z=0$ have charge density $-\\sigma$. The total free charge on an area $A$ of a plate is $Q = \\sigma A$.\n\nWe apply Gauss's law for the electric displacement field $\\mathbf{D}$, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{D} = \\rho_{f}$, where $\\rho_{f}$ is the free charge density. In its integral form, $\\oint_S \\mathbf{D} \\cdot d\\mathbf{a} = Q_{f, \\text{enc}}$, where $S$ is a closed surface and $Q_{f, \\text{enc}}$ is the total free charge enclosed. We consider a cylindrical or box-shaped Gaussian surface (a pillbox) enclosing an area $A$ of the plate at $z=t$, with one face inside the conductor (where $\\mathbf{D}=0$) and the other face inside the dielectric.\n\nDue to the symmetry of the infinite parallel plates, the field $\\mathbf{D}$ must be perpendicular to the plates. Let's define the z-axis to be normal to the plates. The field is $\\mathbf{D} = D_z \\hat{z}$. The flux through the side walls of the pillbox is zero. The flux through the face inside the conductor is zero. The only non-zero contribution to the flux integral is from the face inside the dielectric, which is $\\int \\mathbf{D} \\cdot d\\mathbf{a} = D_z A$. The enclosed free charge is $Q_{f, \\text{enc}} = \\sigma A$.\nThus, from Gauss's law, $D_z A = \\sigma A$, which simplifies to $D_z = \\sigma$. The magnitude of the displacement field is equal to the magnitude of the surface charge density.\n\nNext, we use the constitutive relation for a linear, isotropic dielectric, $\\mathbf{D} = \\epsilon \\mathbf{E}$. This implies that the electric field $\\mathbf{E}$ is also uniform and directed along the z-axis. The magnitude of the electric field is $E = \\frac{D_z}{\\epsilon} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon}$. The direction of $\\mathbf{E}$ is from the positive plate to the negative plate. If the plate at $z=t$ is at a higher potential, then $\\mathbf{E} = -E \\hat{z} = -\\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon} \\hat{z}$.\n\nThe potential difference $V$ between the plates is the line integral of the electric field from the negative plate to the positive plate:\n$$V = V(t) - V(0) = -\\int_{0}^{t} \\mathbf{E} \\cdot d\\mathbf{l}$$\nWith $d\\mathbf{l} = dz \\hat{z}$, we have:\n$$V = -\\int_{0}^{t} \\left(-\\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon}\\hat{z}\\right) \\cdot (dz \\hat{z}) = \\int_{0}^{t} \\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon} dz = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon} t$$\n\nThe capacitance $C$ is defined as the ratio of the magnitude of the charge on one plate to the potential difference between the plates, $C \\equiv Q/V$. The charge on area $A$ is $Q = \\sigma A$.\n$$C = \\frac{\\sigma A}{\\frac{\\sigma t}{\\epsilon}} = \\frac{\\epsilon A}{t}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the capacitance per unit area, which we will denote as $C_{\\text{area}}$. Dividing the capacitance $C$ by the area $A$:\n$$C_{\\text{area}} = \\frac{C}{A} = \\frac{\\epsilon}{t}$$\nThis is the general formula for the capacitance per unit area of a parallel-plate capacitor.\n\nNow, we apply this formula to the two specified oxide layers in the SOI structure.\nThe areal capacitance of the gate oxide, $C_{\\text{ox}}$, is given by:\n$$C_{\\text{ox}} = \\frac{\\epsilon_{\\text{ox}}}{t_{\\text{ox}}}$$\nwhere $t_{\\text{ox}} = 1.2\\ \\text{nm}$ and $\\epsilon_{\\text{ox}} = 3.9\\,\\epsilon_{0}$.\n\nThe areal capacitance of the Buried Oxide, $C_{\\text{BOX}}$, is given by:\n$$C_{\\text{BOX}} = \\frac{\\epsilon_{\\text{BOX}}}{t_{\\text{BOX}}}$$\nwhere $t_{\\text{BOX}} = 100\\ \\text{nm}$ and $\\epsilon_{\\text{BOX}} = 3.9\\,\\epsilon_{0}$.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the dimensionless ratio $\\frac{C_{\\text{BOX}}}{C_{\\text{ox}}}$.\n$$\\frac{C_{\\text{BOX}}}{C_{\\text{ox}}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon_{\\text{BOX}}}{t_{\\text{BOX}}}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{\\epsilon_{\\text{ox}}}{t_{\\text{ox}}}\\right)}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the permittivities:\n$$\\frac{C_{\\text{BOX}}}{C_{\\text{ox}}} = \\frac{\\frac{3.9\\,\\epsilon_{0}}{t_{\\text{BOX}}}}{\\frac{3.9\\,\\epsilon_{0}}{t_{\\text{ox}}}}$$\nThe term $3.9\\,\\epsilon_{0}$ is common to both the numerator and the denominator, so it cancels out. The ratio simplifies to the inverse ratio of the thicknesses:\n$$\\frac{C_{\\text{BOX}}}{C_{\\text{ox}}} = \\frac{t_{\\text{ox}}}{t_{\\text{BOX}}}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values for the thicknesses: $t_{\\text{ox}} = 1.2\\ \\text{nm}$ and $t_{\\text{BOX}} = 100\\ \\text{nm}$.\n$$\\frac{C_{\\text{BOX}}}{C_{\\text{ox}}} = \\frac{1.2\\ \\text{nm}}{100\\ \\text{nm}} = \\frac{1.2}{100} = 0.012$$\nThe problem requires the final ratio to be rounded to four significant figures.

The lowest possible energy for an electron in the conduction band is no longer the bulk conduction band minimum, $E_{c, \\text{bulk}}$, but is elevated by the ground-state confinement energy, $E_1$. The effective conduction band edge is therefore $E_{c, \\text{eff}} = E_{c, \\text{bulk}} + E_1$.\n\nTo achieve threshold (inversion), the gate must apply a potential sufficient to populate this lowest subband. The gate potential must do additional work to overcome the energy elevation $E_1$. The relationship between this additional potential energy and the required shift in gate voltage, $\\Delta V_T$, is $E_1 = q\\Delta V_T$. Therefore, the threshold voltage shift due to quantum confinement can be approximated as:\n$$\n\\Delta V_T \\approx \\frac{E_1}{q}\n$$\nThis approximation is valid as it captures the dominant physical effect.\n\nTo explain the scaling, we substitute the derived expression for $E_1$ into the equation for $\\Delta V_T$:\n$$\n\\Delta V_T \\approx \\frac{1}{q} \\left( \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2m^{\\star} t_{\\text{si}}^2} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{\\pi^2 \\hbar^2}{2 q m^{\\star}} \\right) t_{\\text{si}}^{-2}\n$$\nSince $\\hbar$, $q$, and $m^{\\star}$ are constants for a given material system, the entire term in the parenthesis is a constant. This explicitly shows that the threshold voltage shift $\\Delta V_T$ is inversely proportional to the square of the silicon film thickness, $t_{\\text{si}}$. As the film becomes thinner, confinement becomes stronger, $E_1$ increases, and $\\Delta V_T$ increases as $t_{\\text{si}}^{-2}$.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation of $\\Delta V_T$**\n\nWe use the derived formula for $\\Delta V_T$ and the given values.
