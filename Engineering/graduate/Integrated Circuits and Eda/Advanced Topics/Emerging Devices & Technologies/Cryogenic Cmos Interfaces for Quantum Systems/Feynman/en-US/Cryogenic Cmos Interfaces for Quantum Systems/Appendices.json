            "solution": "The problem is first validated against the required criteria.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Length of the wire: $L=0.5\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- Cross-sectional area: $A=0.1\\,\\mathrm{mm^2}$\n- Hot stage temperature: $T_{\\mathrm{hot}}=300\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- Cold stage temperature: $T_{\\mathrm{cold}}=4\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- Assumption: One-dimensional, steady-state heat conduction.\n- Assumption: Negligible radiation and convection.\n- Assumption: Approximate constant thermal conductivity $\\kappa(T)=\\kappa_{0}$.\n- Constant thermal conductivity value: $\\kappa_{0}=400\\,\\mathrm{W/(m\\cdot K)}$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on Fourier's law of heat conduction, a fundamental principle of physics. The context of heat load in a cryostat for quantum systems is realistic and relevant. The material (oxygen-free copper) and temperatures ($300\\,\\mathrm{K}$ and $4\\,\\mathrm{K}$) are standard in this field. The assumption of constant thermal conductivity is a common and explicitly stated simplification for introductory analysis.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary parameters ($L$, $A$, $T_{\\mathrm{hot}}$, $T_{\\mathrm{cold}}$, $\\kappa_0$) and boundary conditions to determine a unique, stable solution for the steady-state heat flow rate.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, technical language, free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of an expression for the steady-state heat flow rate, $\\dot{Q}$, and its numerical calculation. The physical process is governed by Fourier's law of heat conduction. In one dimension, the law is expressed as:\n$$\n\\dot{Q} = - \\kappa(T) A \\frac{dT}{dx}\n$$\nwhere $\\dot{Q}$ is the heat flow rate (in Watts), $\\kappa(T)$ is the temperature-dependent thermal conductivity, $A$ is the cross-sectional area, and $\\frac{dT}{dx}$ is the temperature gradient along the direction of heat flow, $x$.\n\nThe problem states to assume steady-state conduction, which implies that the heat flow rate $\\dot{Q}$ is constant at every point along the wire. It also specifies that the thermal conductivity can be treated as a constant, $\\kappa(T) = \\kappa_{0}$. With these assumptions, Fourier's law simplifies to:\n$$\n\\dot{Q} = - \\kappa_0 A \\frac{dT}{dx}\n$$\nTo find the total heat flow over the length of the wire, we can rearrange this differential equation to separate the variables $x$ and $T$:\n$$\n\\dot{Q} dx = - \\kappa_0 A dT\n$$\nWe integrate both sides. The position $x$ ranges from $0$ (at the hot end) to $L$ (at the cold end). Correspondingly, the temperature $T$ ranges from $T_{\\mathrm{hot}}$ at $x=0$ to $T_{\\mathrm{cold}}$ at $x=L$.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{L} \\dot{Q} dx = \\int_{T_{\\mathrm{hot}}}^{T_{\\mathrm{cold}}} - \\kappa_0 A dT\n$$\nSince $\\dot{Q}$, $\\kappa_0$, and $A$ are all constants, they can be moved outside the integrals:\n$$\n\\dot{Q} \\int_{0}^{L} dx = - \\kappa_0 A \\int_{T_{\\mathrm{hot}}}^{T_{\\mathrm{cold}}} dT\n$$\nPerforming the integration yields:\n$$\n\\dot{Q} [x]_{0}^{L} = - \\kappa_0 A [T]_{T_{\\mathrm{hot}}}^{T_{\\mathrm{cold}}}\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{Q} (L-0) = - \\kappa_0 A (T_{\\mathrm{cold}} - T_{\\mathrm{hot}})\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\n\\dot{Q} L = \\kappa_0 A (T_{\\mathrm{hot}} - T_{\\mathrm{cold}})\n$$\nSolving for the heat flow rate $\\dot{Q}$ gives the derived expression:\n$$\n\\dot{Q} = \\frac{\\kappa_0 A (T_{\\mathrm{hot}} - T_{\\mathrm{cold}})}{L}\n$$\nThis expression represents the steady-state heat flow into the cold stage.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of $\\dot{Q}$ using the given data. First, all values must be in consistent SI units. The cross-sectional area $A$ is given in $\\mathrm{mm^2}$ and must be converted to $\\mathrm{m^2}$:\n$$\nA = 0.1\\,\\mathrm{mm^2} = 0.1 \\times (10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m})^2 = 0.1 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m^2} = 1 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m^2}\n$$\nThe other parameters are already in SI units:\n- $\\kappa_{0}=400\\,\\mathrm{W/(m\\cdot K)}$\n- $T_{\\mathrm{hot}}=300\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- $T_{\\mathrm{cold}}=4\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- $L=0.5\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression for $\\dot{Q}$:\n$$\n\\dot{Q} = \\frac{(400\\,\\mathrm{W/(m\\cdot K)}) \\times (1 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m^2}) \\times (300\\,\\mathrm{K} - 4\\,\\mathrm{K})}{0.5\\,\\mathrm{m}}\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{Q} = \\frac{400 \\times 10^{-7} \\times 296}{0.5} \\,\\mathrm{W}\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{Q} = \\frac{0.01184}{0.5} \\,\\mathrm{W}\n$$\n$$\n\\dot{Q} = 0.02368\\,\\mathrm{W}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The first three significant figures are $2$, $3$, and $6$. The fourth digit is $8$, which is greater than or equal to $5$, so we round up the third significant figure.\n$$\n\\dot{Q} \\approx 0.0237\\,\\mathrm{W}\n$$\nThis is the final computed heat flow rate into the $4\\,\\mathrm{K}$ stage.",

Numerically, this is most robustly achieved by using a linear algebra solver.\n\nThe computational procedure for each test case is as follows:\n$1$. For the given parameters ($T_{\\mathrm{hot}}$, $T_{4,\\mathrm{bath}}$, $T_{20,\\mathrm{bath}}$, $G_{300\\rightarrow 4}$, $G_{4\\rightarrow \\mathrm{bath}}$, $G_{4\\rightarrow 20}$, $G_{20\\rightarrow \\mathrm{bath}}$, $P_{\\mathrm{in}}$, $A_4$, $A_{20}$), first compute the dissipated powers $P_{4,\\mathrm{diss}}$ and $P_{20,\\mathrm{diss}}$.\n$2$. Construct the matrix $M$ and the vector $\\mathbf{b}$ using the parameter values and the calculated dissipated powers.\n$3$. Solve the linear system $M \\cdot \\mathbf{T} = \\mathbf{b}$ for the temperature vector $\\mathbf{T}$ to find $T_4$ and $T_{20}$.\nThis procedure will be implemented for all provided test cases.",
