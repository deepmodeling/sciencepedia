This exercise provides hands-on practice in connecting the internal state dynamics of a memristor to this observable electrical characteristic. By analyzing a simplified linear drift model under a sinusoidal voltage, you will use a perturbative approach to derive how the area of the hysteresis lobe, which represents energy dissipated per cycle, depends on frequency . This skill is vital for understanding device behavior and for high-frequency applications.",
