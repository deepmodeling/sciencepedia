The solution process will now proceed.\n\n---\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of an expression for the areal density of interface traps, $\\Delta D_{\\text{it}}$, from the measured threshold voltage shift, $|\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}|$. The derivation begins from fundamental electrostatic principles applied to the MOS structure.\n\nThe change in the threshold voltage, $\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}$, due to a change in the charge density at the silicon-oxide interface, $\\Delta Q_{\\text{it}}$, is given by the relation:\n$$\n\\Delta V_{\\text{th}} = - \\frac{\\Delta Q_{\\text{it}}}{C_{\\text{ox}}}\n$$\nHere, $C_{\\text{ox}}$ is the gate oxide capacitance per unit area. The negative sign indicates that a positive interface charge ($\\Delta Q_{\\text{it}} > 0$), which is characteristic of NBTI in PMOSFETs, causes the threshold voltage to become more negative ($\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}  0$). The problem provides the magnitude of the threshold voltage shift, $|\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}|$. Since $\\Delta Q_{\\text{it}}$ and $C_{\\text{ox}}$ are both positive quantities, we can write:\n$$\n|\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}| = \\frac{\\Delta Q_{\\text{it}}}{C_{\\text{ox}}}\n$$\nThe gate oxide capacitance per unit area, $C_{\\text{ox}}$, is modeled as a parallel-plate capacitor:\n$$\nC_{\\text{ox}} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_{\\text{ox}}}{t_{\\text{ox}}}\n$$\nwhere $t_{\\text{ox}}$ is the oxide thickness and $\\varepsilon_{\\text{ox}}$ is the permittivity of the gate dielectric (silicon dioxide). The permittivity $\\varepsilon_{\\text{ox}}$ is related to the vacuum permittivity $\\varepsilon_{0}$ and the relative permittivity $\\kappa_{\\text{ox}}$ by:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{\\text{ox}} = \\kappa_{\\text{ox}} \\varepsilon_{0}\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions for $C_{\\text{ox}}$ and $\\varepsilon_{\\text{ox}}$ into the equation for $|\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}|$ yields:\n$$\n|\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}| = \\frac{\\Delta Q_{\\text{it}}}{\\left(\\frac{\\kappa_{\\text{ox}} \\varepsilon_{0}}{t_{\\text{ox}}}\\right)} = \\frac{\\Delta Q_{\\text{it}} \\cdot t_{\\text{ox}}}{\\kappa_{\\text{ox}} \\varepsilon_{0}}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the areal density of charged interface traps, $\\Delta D_{\\text{it}}$, which has units of traps per unit area (e.g., $\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$). The problem states that the newly created traps are fully charged. Assuming each trap contributes a single elementary charge, $q$, the total interface charge density $\\Delta Q_{\\text{it}}$ is related to the trap density $\\Delta D_{\\text{it}}$ by:\n$$\n\\Delta Q_{\\text{it}} = q \\cdot \\Delta D_{\\text{it}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into our equation for $|\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}|$ gives:\n$$\n|\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}| = \\frac{(q \\cdot \\Delta D_{\\text{it}}) \\cdot t_{\\text{ox}}}{\\kappa_{\\text{ox}} \\varepsilon_{0}}\n$$\nWe now solve for $\\Delta D_{\\text{it}}$, which is the desired expression:\n$$\n\\Delta D_{\\text{it}} = \\frac{|\\Delta V_{\\text{th}}| \\cdot \\kappa_{\\text{ox}} \\varepsilon_{0}}{q \\cdot t_{\\text{ox}}}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation.

The rising delay of a CMOS gate is determined by how quickly the pull-up PMOS transistor can charge the load capacitance. The strength of the PMOS transistor, and thus its ability to supply charging current, is principally governed by its gate overdrive voltage, which is the difference between the supply voltage and its threshold voltage magnitude. When NBTI causes the threshold voltage magnitude to increase, the gate overdrive voltage for the PMOS transistor decreases. According to the current model, this reduced overdrive leads to a weaker, or smaller, pull-up current. Since the load capacitance remains constant, this weaker current takes a longer time to charge the output node to the required logic-high voltage level, thereby directly increasing the rising propagation delay.",

For a trap with a time constant $\\tau$, its charge occupancy $p(t)$ at a time $t$ into the recovery phase is given by:\n$$ \\frac{dp}{dt} = -\\frac{p}{\\tau} $$\nWith the initial condition that the occupancy is $p(0)$ at the beginning of the readout phase (which starts at $t=0$), the solution to this differential equation is:\n$$ p(t) = p(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right) $$\nThe threshold voltage shift, $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{th}}$, is stated to be proportional to the occupancy. For a single trap or a sub-ensemble of identical traps with time constant $\\tau$, we can write $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{th},\\tau}(t) = k \\cdot p(t)$, where $k$ is a constant of proportionality.\n\nThe fractional loss in $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{th}}$ for this specific trap type during a readout window of duration $t_{\\mathrm{m}}$ is defined as the change in $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{th}}$ divided by its initial value:\n$$ \\text{Fractional Loss} = \\frac{\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{th},\\tau}(0) - \\Delta V_{\\mathrm{th},\\tau}(t_{\\mathrm{m}})}{\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{th},\\tau}(0)} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{th},\\tau}$ and $p(t)$:\n$$ \\text{Fractional Loss} = \\frac{k \\cdot p(0) - k \\cdot p(t_{\\mathrm{m}})}{k \\cdot p(0)} = \\frac{p(0) - p(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{\\mathrm{m}}}{\\tau}\\right)}{p(0)} = 1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{\\mathrm{m}}}{\\tau}\\right) $$\nThe engineering requirement is that this fractional loss must not exceed a tolerance $\\varepsilon$ for *any* trap with a recovery time constant $\\tau \\ge \\tau_{\\mathrm{c}}$.

We analyze the derivative of $f(\\tau)$ with respect to $\\tau$:\n$$ \\frac{df}{d\\tau} = \\frac{d}{d\\tau}\\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{\\mathrm{m}}}{\\tau}\\right)\\right) = - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{\\mathrm{m}}}{\\tau}\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{t_{\\mathrm{m}}}{\\tau^2}\\right) $$\nSince $t_{\\mathrm{m}} > 0$ and $\\tau > 0$, the exponential term is positive and the term in parentheses is positive.

Recovery is an inherently time-dependent process where trapped charge is released, causing $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{th}}$ to decay back toward its pre-stress value. Accurate measurement of the post-stress $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{th}}$ requires capturing its state *before* significant recovery occurs. The total measurement time, $t_{\\mathrm{m}}$, must therefore be much smaller than the characteristic time constants of the recovery process, i.e., $t_{\\mathrm{m}} \\ll \\tau$.\n\nThe \"single-shot\" nature avoids time-averaging over a long interval, which would obscure the initial $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{th}}$ value. The \"on-the-fly\" method further enhances speed by avoiding slow voltage sweeps. Instead of sweeping the gate voltage to find $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$, the gate is stepped to a fixed overdrive voltage, and the drain current is sampled once. Using a pre-calibrated transconductance value, this single current sample is sufficient to extrapolate the instantaneous $V_{\\mathrm{th}}$ without further delay. The decomposition of the total latency into $t_{\\mathrm{m}} = t_{\\mathrm{set}} + t_{\\mathrm{sense}} + t_{\\mathrm{ADC}}$ identifies the specific hardware-limited bottlenecks (gate-voltage settling time, sense-amplifier acquisition time, and analog-to-digital conversion time). Engineering efforts to minimize NBTI measurement error focus on reducing each of these constituent latencies. The cutoff $\\tau_{\\mathrm{c}}$ provides a practical target; the measurement must be fast enough to accurately capture the contributions of all traps slower than this cutoff.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculation of Margin Time**\n\nFirst, we calculate the intrinsic duration of the readout window, $t_{\\mathrm{m}}$, using the provided latencies:\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{m}} = t_{\\mathrm{set}} + t_{\\mathrm{sense}} + t_{\\mathrm{ADC}} = 2 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{s} + 1 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{s} + 3 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{s} = 6 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{s} $$\nNext, we calculate the maximum permissible total time, $t_{\\mathrm{total, max}}$, using the derived bound with the given parameters $\\varepsilon = 0.02$ and $\\tau_{\\mathrm{c}} = 5 \\times 10^{-4} \\, \\text{s}$:\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{total, max}} = -\\tau_{\\mathrm{c}} \\ln(1 - \\varepsilon) = -(5 \\times 10^{-4}) \\ln(1 - 0.02) = -(5 \\times 10^{-4}) \\ln(0.98) $$\nUsing a calculator for the natural logarithm:\n$$ \\ln(0.98) \\approx -0.0202027... $$\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{total, max}} \\approx -(5 \\times 10^{-4})(-0.0202027) \\, \\text{s} \\approx 1.010135 \\times 10^{-5} \\, \\text{s} $$\nThe total measurement time including the additional margin time $t_{\\mathrm{extra}}$ is $t_{\\mathrm{m}} + t_{\\mathrm{extra}}$. This must not exceed the maximum permissible time:\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{m}} + t_{\\mathrm{extra}} \\le t_{\\mathrm{total, max}} $$\nThe maximum allowable additional margin time, $t_{\\mathrm{extra, max}}$, is therefore:\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{extra, max}} = t_{\\mathrm{total, max}} - t_{\\mathrm{m}} $$\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{extra, max}} \\approx (1.010135 \\times 10^{-5} - 6 \\times 10^{-6}) \\, \\text{s} $$\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{extra, max}} \\approx (10.10135 \\times 10^{-6} - 6 \\times 10^{-6}) \\, \\text{s} \\approx 4.10135 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{s} $$\nRounding the final answer to four significant figures as requested:\n$$ t_{\\mathrm{extra, max}} \\approx 4.101 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\text{s} $$",
            "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.101 \\times 10^{-6}}$$"
