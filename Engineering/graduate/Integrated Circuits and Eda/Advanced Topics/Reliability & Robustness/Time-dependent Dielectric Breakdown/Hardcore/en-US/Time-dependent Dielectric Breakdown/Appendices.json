We can combine this with the proportionality constant into a single pre-factor, $A_0$. This leads to the exponential field dependence known as the $E$-model:\n$$\\mathrm{TTF}(E) = A_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha}{k_B T} E\\right)$$\nThis model is conventionally written in the form:\n$$\\mathrm{TTF}(E) = A_0 \\exp(-\\gamma E)$$\nBy comparing the derived expression with the conventional form, we identify the field acceleration factor, $\\gamma$, as:\n$$\\gamma = \\frac{\\alpha}{k_B T}$$\nThis confirms that $\\gamma$ encapsulates the sensitivity of the failure time to the electric field, which is determined by the material's barrier-lowering parameter $\\alpha$ relative to the available thermal energy $k_B T$.\n\nTo compute the numerical value of $\\gamma$ from the experimental data, we use the model equation for the two given data points:\n$$ \\mathrm{TTF}_1 = A_0 \\exp(-\\gamma E_1) $$\n$$ \\mathrm{TTF}_2 = A_0 \\exp(-\\gamma E_2) $$\nTo eliminate the unknown pre-factor $A_0$, we take the ratio of these two equations:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{TTF}_1}{\\mathrm{TTF}_2} = \\frac{A_0 \\exp(-\\gamma E_1)}{A_0 \\exp(-\\gamma E_2)} = \\exp(-\\gamma E_1 - (-\\gamma E_2)) = \\exp(\\gamma(E_2 - E_1)) $$\nTo solve for $\\gamma$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{TTF}_1}{\\mathrm{TTF}_2}\\right) = \\gamma(E_2 - E_1) $$\nIsolating $\\gamma$ yields the final expression for its calculation:\n$$ \\gamma = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{TTF}_1}{\\mathrm{TTF}_2}\\right)}{E_2 - E_1} $$\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values into this expression. The units of time for $\\mathrm{TTF}$ will cancel. The units for $E$ are given in $\\mathrm{MV/cm}$, so the resulting units for $\\gamma$ will be $\\mathrm{cm/MV}$.\nGiven:\n$E_1 = 6.5\\,\\mathrm{MV/cm}$\n$\\mathrm{TTF}_1 = 5000\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n$E_2 = 8.0\\,\\mathrm{MV/cm}$\n$\\mathrm{TTF}_2 = 800\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n\n$$ \\gamma = \\frac{\\ln\\left(\\frac{5000}{800}\\right)}{8.0 - 6.5} $$\nFirst, simplify the terms inside the expression:\n$$ \\frac{5000}{800} = \\frac{50}{8} = 6.25 $$\n$$ 8.0 - 6.5 = 1.5 $$\nNow, substitute these simplified values back into the equation for $\\gamma$:\n$$ \\gamma = \\frac{\\ln(6.25)}{1.5} $$\nWe compute the numerical value of the natural logarithm:\n$$ \\ln(6.25) \\approx 1.83258146 $$\nFinally, we compute $\\gamma$:\n$$ \\gamma \\approx \\frac{1.83258146}{1.5} \\approx 1.22172097 $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\gamma \\approx 1.222 $$\nThe units are $\\mathrm{cm}/\\mathrm{MV}$.",

            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically evaluated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information and conditions to compute the activation energies and subsequently provide a physical explanation based on established models of dielectric breakdown.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the activation energy, $E_a$, for Time-Dependent Dielectric Breakdown (TDDB) in two different dielectrics, amorphous silicon dioxide ($\\mathrm{SiO}_2$) and amorphous hafnium dioxide ($\\mathrm{HfO}_2$), from experimental data. It is assumed that the failure process is governed by a single thermally activated mechanism.\n\nA thermally activated process is one whose rate, $R$, is described by the Arrhenius equation:\n$$R(T) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nwhere $A$ is a pre-exponential factor related to the attempt frequency, $E_a$ is the activation energy representing the energy barrier for the process, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.\n\nThe problem states that the median time-to-failure, $\\mathrm{TTF}$, is inversely proportional to the underlying defect-generation rate, which we identify with the rate $R$.

The activation energy $E_a$ represents the effective energy barrier for the rate-limiting step in the physical degradation process that culminates in breakdown. Breakdown itself occurs when a critical density of defects (electronic traps) is generated within the dielectric, forming a conductive percolation path. Therefore, $E_a$ is fundamentally linked to the energy required to create these defects.\n\nThe primary defect creation event is the rupture of chemical bonds within the dielectric matrix, assisted by the high electric field and thermal energy. The factors controlling $E_a$ include:\n\n1.  **Intrinsic Bond Strength**: The energy required to break a chemical bond is a dominant contributor to $E_a$. The $\\mathrm{Si-O}$ bond in amorphous $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$ is a strong, highly covalent bond with a dissociation energy of approximately $8.3 \\, \\mathrm{eV}$. In contrast, the $\\mathrm{Hf-O}$ bond in amorphous $\\mathrm{HfO}_2$ is weaker and has a more ionic character, with a bond energy of approximately $8.0 \\, \\mathrm{eV}$. While $E_a$ is not identical to the bond dissociation energy (it is the energy of a field-distorted transition state), a stronger intrinsic bond naturally leads to a higher activation energy for rupture. This is consistent with our finding that $E_{a, \\mathrm{SiO}_2} > E_{a, \\mathrm{HfO}_2}$.\n\n2.  **Material Structure and Intrinsic Defects**: High-quality, thermally grown $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$ is a nearly ideal amorphous network with a very low density of pre-existing defects. In contrast, high-$k$ dielectrics like $\\mathrm{HfO}_2$, typically deposited by methods like atomic layer deposition (ALD), possess a significantly higher concentration of intrinsic defects. The most prominent among these in $\\mathrm{HfO}_2$ are oxygen vacancies. These vacancies act as electronic traps and can serve as precursors for further defect generation under electrical and thermal stress. The energy barrier to create additional defects starting from these pre-existing weak spots, or to cause defect migration (like vacancy hopping), is lower than the barrier for rupturing a strong $\\mathrm{Si-O}$ bond in a pristine network. This lowers the overall effective activation energy for failure in $\\mathrm{HfO}_2$.\n\n3.  **Dielectric Properties and Local Field Enhancement**: $\\mathrm{HfO}_2$ is a high-$k$ dielectric (dielectric constant $k \\approx 20-25$), whereas $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$ is a low-$k$ dielectric ($k \\approx 3.9$). The high polarizability of $\\mathrm{HfO}_2$ (both electronic and ionic), which is the source of its high $k$-value, means that its constituent atoms respond more strongly to an applied electric field. The $\\mathrm{Hf-O}$ bonds, being more polar, are more susceptible to field-induced stretching and weakening. This can lead to a greater reduction of the bond-rupture energy barrier by the electric field compared to the less polar $\\mathrm{Si-O}$ bonds. Even under identical macroscopic fields, local field enhancements at the atomic scale can be more pronounced in the more polarizable $\\mathrm{HfO}_2$ lattice, further lowering the effective $E_a$.\n\nIn summary, the significantly higher activation energy for TDDB in $\\mathrm{SiO}_2$ ($0.806 \\, \\mathrm{eV}$) compared to $\\mathrm{HfO}_2$ ($0.349 \\, \\mathrm{eV}$) is a direct consequence of fundamental material differences. It is primarily attributed to the greater strength and covalent nature of the $\\mathrm{Si-O}$ bond, the lower density of intrinsic defects in the $\\mathrm{SiO}_2}$ network, and the lower polarizability of the material, all of which contribute to a higher energy barrier for defect generation under stress.",

The engineering context is Electronic Design Automation (EDA) reliability analysis, and the task is to determine which field-acceleration model better explains the data among two canonical hypotheses used in time-dependent dielectric breakdown. The analysis must be formulated purely as a mathematical and statistical modeling challenge, suitable for implementation in a program.\n\nAssume the following modeling base: In accelerated stress testing, it is widely observed that the logarithm of failure time responds approximately linearly to a chosen function of the stress variable when the acceleration mechanism is exponential in that stress variable. Specifically, if a response variable $y$ depends exponentially on a predictor $u$ as $y = \\exp(\\alpha + \\beta u)$ for constants $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, then the transformed variable $\\ln(y)$ is linearly related to $u$, i.e., $\\ln(y) = \\alpha + \\beta u$. This property is foundational in log-linear regression modeling and does not presuppose which specific $u$ is correct for a given data, but allows model fitting once $u$ is hypothesized.\n\nIn time-dependent dielectric breakdown analysis, two competing hypotheses are often considered for the functional dependence of the logarithm of time-to-failure on the electric field $E$:\n- the hypothesis that the appropriate predictor is the field itself $u = E$ (denote this as the E-model), and\n- the hypothesis that the appropriate predictor is the reciprocal field $u = 1/E$ (denote this as the 1/E-model).\n\nYour task is to:\n1.

            "solution": "The problem requires a statistical comparison of two competing physical models for time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) using experimental data. The analysis will be conducted by fitting linear regression models, computing goodness-of-fit statistics, and performing hypothesis tests to select the more appropriate model for each given dataset. The entire procedure is based on the principles of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and the general linear hypothesis test (specifically, the partial F-test).\n\n### 1. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression\n\nA linear regression model is expressed in matrix form as $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$, where $\\mathbf{y}$ is the $n \\times 1$ vector of observed responses, $\\mathbf{X}$ is the $n \\times p$ design matrix of predictors (including an intercept term), $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ is the $p \\times 1$ vector of model coefficients, and $\\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$ is the $n \\times 1$ vector of random errors.\n\nThe OLS method finds the coefficient vector $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$ that minimizes the residual sum of squares ($RSS$), which is the sum of the squared differences between the observed and predicted responses. The solution is given by the normal equations:\n$$\n(\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X}) \\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{y}\n$$\nSolving for $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$ gives the OLS estimator:\n$$\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = (\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X})^{-1} \\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{y}\n$$\nOnce $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$ is determined, key statistics are calculated:\n- **Predicted Responses**: $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}} = \\mathbf{X}\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$\n- **Residuals**: $\\mathbf{e} = \\mathbf{y} - \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$\n- **Residual Sum of Squares ($RSS$)**: $RSS = \\mathbf{e}^T \\mathbf{e} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2$\n- **Total Sum of Squares ($TSS$)**: $TSS = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\bar{y})^2$, where $\\bar{y}$ is the mean of the observed responses.\n- **Coefficient of Determination ($R^2$)**: $R^2 = 1 - \\frac{RSS}{TSS}$. This metric represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).\n\n### 2. Model Specification\n\nFor each dataset of size $n$, the dependent variable is $y_i = \\ln(TTF_i)$. We construct three models.\n\n- **Model A (E-model)**: $\\ln(\\mathrm{TTF}) = a_0 + a_1 E + \\varepsilon$. This is a simple linear regression model with $p_A=2$ parameters $(\\beta_0=a_0, \\beta_1=a_1)$. The design matrix is:\n$$ \\mathbf{X}_A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & E_1 \\\\ 1 & E_2 \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\ 1 & E_n \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n- **Model B (1/E-model)**: $\\ln(\\mathrm{TTF}) = b_0 + b_1 \\left(\\frac{1}{E}\\right) + \\varepsilon$. This is also a simple linear regression model with $p_B=2$ parameters $(\\beta_0=b_0, \\beta_1=b_1)$. The design matrix is:\n$$ \\mathbf{X}_B = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1/E_1 \\\\ 1 & 1/E_2 \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\ 1 & 1/E_n \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n- **Model C (Combined model)**: $\\ln(\\mathrm{TTF}) = c_0 + c_1 E + c_2 \\left(\\frac{1}{E}\\right) + \\varepsilon$. This is a multiple regression model with $p_C=3$ parameters $(c_0, c_1, c_2)$. It serves as the \"unrestricted\" model for hypothesis testing. The design matrix is:\n$$ \\mathbf{X}_C = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & E_1 & 1/E_1 \\\\ 1 & E_2 & 1/E_2 \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\ 1 & E_n & 1/E_n \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n### 3. Hypothesis Testing via Partial F-test\n\nTo assess whether a predictor adds significant explanatory power to a model that already contains other predictors, we use a partial F-test. This test compares a \"restricted\" model (where some coefficients are forced to be zero) with an \"unrestricted\" model.\n\n- **Testing the significance of $E$ in the presence of $1/E$**: We test the null hypothesis $H_0: c_1 = 0$ in Model C. This makes Model B the restricted model and Model C the unrestricted model. The F-statistic is:\n$$ F_E = \\frac{(RSS_B - RSS_C) / q}{RSS_C / (n - p_C)} $$\nwhere $RSS_B$ and $RSS_C$ are the residual sums of squares for Models B and C, respectively. Here, $q=1$ is the number of restrictions, $n$ is the number of data points, and $p_C=3$ is the number of parameters in the unrestricted model (Model C). The statistic follows an F-distribution with $(q, n - p_C)$ degrees of freedom. We compute a $p$-value, $p_E$, which is the probability of observing an F-statistic as large as or larger than $F_E$ under the null hypothesis.\n\n- **Testing the significance of $1/E$ in the presence of $E$**: We test the null hypothesis $H_0: c_2 = 0$ in Model C. This makes Model A the restricted model. The F-statistic is:\n$$ F_{1/E} = \\frac{(RSS_A - RSS_C) / q}{RSS_C / (n - p_C)} $$\nThis also follows an F-distribution with $(q, n - p_C)$ degrees of freedom. From this, we compute the corresponding $p$-value, $p_{1/E}$.\n\n### 4. Decision Rule for Model Selection\n\nA decision rule with a significance level $\\alpha = 0.05$ is used to select between Model A and Model B.\n\n1.  If $p_E < \\alpha$ and $p_{1/E} \\ge \\alpha$: The $E$ term is significant while the $1/E$ term is not. Choose Model A.\n2.  If $p_{1/E} < \\alpha$ and $p_E \\ge \\alpha$: The $1/E$ term is significant while the $E$ term is not. Choose Model B.\n3.  If $p_E < \\alpha$ and $p_{1/E} < \\alpha$: Both terms are significant. Choose the simpler model (A or B) that provides a better fit, judged by the smaller $RSS$. The tie-breaker is to choose Model A.\n4.  If $p_E \\ge \\alpha$ and $p_{1/E} \\ge \\alpha$: Neither term adds significant value over the other in the combined model. Choose the simpler model with better goodness-of-fit, judged by the larger coefficient of determination ($R^2$). The tie-breaker is to choose Model A.\n\nThis comprehensive procedure allows for a rigorous, data-driven comparison of the two competing TDDB acceleration models. The implementation involves applying these matrix algebra and statistical formulas to each provided dataset.",
