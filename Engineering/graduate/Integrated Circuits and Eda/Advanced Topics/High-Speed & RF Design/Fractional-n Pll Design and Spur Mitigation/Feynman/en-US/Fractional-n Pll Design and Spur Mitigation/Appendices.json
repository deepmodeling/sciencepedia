            "problem": "A fractional-N Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) employs a Multi-Stage Noise-Shaping (MASH) digital sigma-delta modulator (DSM) to control the instantaneous integer division between $N$ and $N+1$ such that the time-average division ratio equals $N+\\alpha$. The reference frequency is $f_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 40\\,\\mathrm{MHz}$. The target fractional component of the division ratio is $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{tar}} = 0.2718281828$. The DSM input is a $B$-bit fixed-point number, so the realizable fractional division ratios are $\\alpha' = m/2^{B}$ with integer $m \\in \\{0,1,\\dots,2^{B}-1\\}$. The synthesizer must satisfy both of the following specifications:\n\n1) The smallest programmable output frequency increment must not exceed $50\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\n2) To suppress deterministic fractional spurs within the loop bandwidth by ensuring that only the finite input word resolution contributes to any residual deterministic error, the design uses nearest-neighbor rounding of the DSM input and proper dithering. Under this assumption, the worst-case absolute output frequency error due to quantization of $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{tar}}$ must not exceed $5\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\n\nAssume that the output frequency is $f_{\\mathrm{out}} = (N+\\alpha) f_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ and that only the fractional resolution limits the output frequency grid. Also assume that the spur mitigation by dithering is ideal so that limit-cycle tones are eliminated and the only deterministic component is the rounding error of $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{tar}}$ to $\\alpha'$. The modulus must be a power of two, $M = 2^{B}$.\n\nCompute the minimal modulus $M$ that simultaneously satisfies both specifications. Express your final result as an integer with no units. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem requires finding the minimal modulus $M$ of a sigma-delta modulator in a fractional-N Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) that simultaneously satisfies two performance specifications. The modulus $M$ is constrained to be a power of two, i.e., $M = 2^{B}$ for some integer $B$. We will analyze each specification to derive a lower bound on $M$, and then find the smallest power of two that satisfies the most stringent of these bounds.\n\nThe fundamental relationship governing the PLL's output frequency is given as $f_{\\mathrm{out}} = (N+\\alpha) f_{\\mathrm{ref}}$. The fractional part of the division ratio, $\\alpha$, is approximated by a quantized value $\\alpha' = m/M$, where $m$ is an integer and $M=2^B$ is the modulus of the digital sigma-delta modulator.\n\nFirst, let's analyze Specification 1: \"The smallest programmable output frequency increment must not exceed $50\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\"\n\nThe output frequency is a function of the realizable fractional division ratio $\\alpha'$. The smallest programmable frequency step, $\\Delta f_{\\mathrm{out,min}}$, is determined by the smallest possible change in $\\alpha'$. The values of $\\alpha'$ are given by the discrete set $\\{0, 1/M, 2/M, \\dots, (M-1)/M\\}$. The smallest non-zero change in $\\alpha'$ is $\\Delta \\alpha'_{\\mathrm{min}} = 1/M$.\n\nThe corresponding change in the output frequency is:\n$$\n\\Delta f_{\\mathrm{out,min}} = \\Delta \\alpha'_{\\mathrm{min}} \\cdot f_{\\mathrm{ref}} = \\frac{1}{M} f_{\\mathrm{ref}}\n$$\nThe specification requires this step to be no more than $50\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$:\n$$\n\\frac{f_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{M} \\le 50\\,\\mathrm{Hz}\n$$\nWe can rearrange this inequality to find a lower bound on $M$:\n$$\nM \\ge \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{50\\,\\mathrm{Hz}}\n$$\nSubstituting the given reference frequency $f_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 40\\,\\mathrm{MHz} = 40 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$:\n$$\nM \\ge \\frac{40 \\times 10^{6}}{50} = \\frac{4 \\times 10^{7}}{5 \\times 10^{1}} = 0.8 \\times 10^{6} = 800,000\n$$\nThus, the first specification imposes the constraint $M \\ge 800,000$.\n\nNext, let's analyze Specification 2: \"The worst-case absolute output frequency error due to quantization of $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{tar}}$ must not exceed $5\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$.\"\n\nThe target fractional part is $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{tar}} = 0.2718281828$. This continuous value is quantized to the nearest realizable value $\\alpha' = m/M$. The quantization error in the fractional ratio is $\\epsilon_{\\alpha} = \\alpha' - \\alpha_{\\mathrm{tar}}$. For nearest-neighbor rounding, the magnitude of the quantization error is bounded by half the quantization step size:\n$$\n|\\epsilon_{\\alpha}|_{\\mathrm{max}} = \\left| \\alpha' - \\alpha_{\\mathrm{tar}} \\right|_{\\mathrm{max}} \\le \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{1}{M}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2M}\n$$\nThe problem states that this quantization error is the only remaining deterministic error source. The resulting absolute output frequency error is $\\Delta f_{\\mathrm{err}} = \\epsilon_{\\alpha} f_{\\mathrm{ref}}$. The worst-case absolute output frequency error is therefore:\n$$\n|\\Delta f_{\\mathrm{err}}|_{\\mathrm{max}} = |\\epsilon_{\\alpha}|_{\\mathrm{max}} f_{\\mathrm{ref}} = \\frac{1}{2M} f_{\\mathrm{ref}}\n$$\nSpecification 2 requires this error to be no more than $5\\,\\mathrm{Hz}$:\n$$\n\\frac{f_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{2M} \\le 5\\,\\mathrm{Hz}\n$$\nAgain, we rearrange to find a lower bound on $M$:\n$$\nM \\ge \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{2 \\cdot 5\\,\\mathrm{Hz}} = \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{10\\,\\mathrm{Hz}}\n$$\nSubstituting the value of $f_{\\mathrm{ref}}$:\n$$\nM \\ge \\frac{40 \\times 10^{6}}{10} = 4 \\times 10^{6} = 4,000,000\n$$\nThus, the second specification imposes the constraint $M \\ge 4,000,000$.\n\nTo satisfy both specifications simultaneously, the modulus $M$ must satisfy the more restrictive condition. Comparing the two lower bounds:\n$$\nM \\ge 800,000 \\quad (\\text{from Spec 1})\n$$\n$$\nM \\ge 4,000,000 \\quad (\\text{from Spec 2})\n$$\nThe more stringent requirement is $M \\ge 4,000,000$.\n\nFinally, the problem states that the modulus $M$ must be a power of two, i.e., $M=2^{B}$ for some integer $B$. We need to find the smallest integer $B$ such that $2^{B} \\ge 4,000,000$.\n\nWe can solve for $B$ by taking the base-2 logarithm:\n$$\nB \\ge \\log_{2}(4,000,000)\n$$\n$$\nB \\ge \\frac{\\ln(4,000,000)}{\\ln(2)}\n$$\nCalculating the value:\n$$\n\\log_{2}(4,000,000) = \\log_{2}(4 \\times 10^{6}) = \\log_{2}(2^2 \\times 10^6) = 2 + \\log_{2}(10^6) = 2 + 6 \\log_{2}(10)\n$$\nSince $\\log_{2}(10) = \\frac{\\ln(10)}{\\ln(2)} \\approx \\frac{2.302585}{0.693147} \\approx 3.321928$,\n$$\nB \\ge 2 + 6 \\times 3.321928 \\approx 2 + 19.931568 = 21.931568\n$$\nSince $B$ must be an integer, the smallest integer value for $B$ that satisfies this condition is $B = 22$.\n\nThe minimal required modulus is therefore:\n$$\nM = 2^{22} = (2^{10})^2 \\cdot 2^2 = (1024)^2 \\cdot 4 = 1,048,576 \\cdot 4 = 4,194,304\n$$\nThis value $M = 4,194,304$ satisfies both $M \\ge 800,000$ and $M \\ge 4,000,000$. The next smaller power of two, $2^{21} = 2,097,152$, fails to meet the second condition. Hence, the minimal modulus is $2^{22}$.",

The divider command sequence $N[n]$ is produced by a Delta-Sigma Modulator (DSM), which shapes the quantization error with a noise transfer function that depends on its order. When the fractional sequence $\\alpha[n]$ is periodic with period $q$ reference cycles, the modulation of $N[n]$ is periodic at a base frequency $f_{\\text{ref}}/q$, which produces discrete spectral lines at offsets $f_{\\text{out}} \\pm k f_{\\text{ref}}/q$ for integer $k \\geq 1$ around the output frequency $f_{\\text{out}}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires us to determine two parameters of a fractional-N PLL from its output spectrum: the period $q$ of the fractional sequence and the order $m$ of the Delta-Sigma Modulator (DSM). We can determine these two parameters independently from the given observations.\n\nFirst, we determine the period $q$. The problem states that a periodic fractional sequence with a period of $q$ reference clock cycles produces discrete spurs at frequency offsets of $\\pm k \\frac{f_{\\text{ref}}}{q}$ from the carrier, where $k$ is a positive integer. The fundamental frequency of this periodic pattern is therefore $f_{\\text{base\\_spur}} = \\frac{f_{\\text{ref}}}{q}$.\n\nThe measured spectrum shows a dominant spur at an offset of $\\pm 300\\,\\text{kHz}$, with its harmonics appearing at integer multiples of this frequency: $\\pm 600\\,\\text{kHz}$ (which is $2 \\times 300\\,\\text{kHz}$) and $\\pm 900\\,\\text{kHz}$ (which is $3 \\times 300\\,\\text{kHz}$).

The problem states that for a DSM of order $m$, the in-band rise of the quantization noise power spectral density (PSD) scales as $20m$ decibels per decade (dB/dec). This is a standard result derived from the DSM's noise transfer function (NTF). At low frequencies, the NTF magnitude is approximately $|\\text{NTF}(f)| \\propto f^m$. The noise PSD is proportional to the square of the magnitude, so the PSD, $S_{\\text{noise}}(f)$, is proportional to $(f^m)^2 = f^{2m}$.\n\nTo find the slope in dB/dec, we evaluate the change in the PSD level (in dB) over one decade of frequency. Let the PSD at frequency $f_1$ be $S_1$ and at frequency $f_2 = 10f_1$ be $S_2$. The slope is:\n$$\n\\text{Slope} = 10\\log_{10}(S_2) - 10\\log_{10}(S_1) = 10\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{S_2}{S_1}\\right)\n$$\nSince $S_{\\text{noise}}(f) \\propto f^{2m}$, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{S_2}{S_1} = \\frac{(10f_1)^{2m}}{(f_1)^{2m}} = 10^{2m}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the slope equation:\n$$\n\\text{Slope} = 10\\log_{10}(10^{2m}) = 10 \\cdot (2m) = 20m \\;\\text{dB/dec}\n$$\nThis confirms the relationship provided in the problem statement.
