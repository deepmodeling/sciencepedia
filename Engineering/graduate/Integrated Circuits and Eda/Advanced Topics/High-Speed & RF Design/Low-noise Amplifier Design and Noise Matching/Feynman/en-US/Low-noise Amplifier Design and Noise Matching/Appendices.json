The result is calculable and, in principle, experimentally verifiable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\nThe fundamental principle governing this problem is the Johnson-Nyquist noise in a resistor. A physical resistor with resistance $R$ at an absolute temperature $T$ can be modeled as an ideal, noiseless resistor in series with a noise voltage source, $v_n$. The one-sided power spectral density of this voltage source, for frequencies much less than $k_B T/h$ (where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $h$ is Planck's constant), is given by:\n$$\nS_v(f) = 4k_B T R\n$$\nThis spectral density is independent of frequency, representing white noise. When multiple noise sources are uncorrelated, as is the case for thermal noise from distinct resistors, their power spectral densities add.\n\n**Option A: Series Configuration**\n\nIn the series configuration, the two resistors $R_1$ and $R_2$ are connected in series. Each resistor is modeled with its associated series noise voltage source, $v_{n1}$ and $v_{n2}$ respectively. The total open-circuit voltage $v_{n,s}$ across the two-terminal network is the sum of the individual noise voltages:\n$$\nv_{n,s}(t) = v_{n1}(t) + v_{n2}(t)\n$$\nSince the noise sources are uncorrelated, the total voltage noise spectral density, $S_{v,s}$, is the sum of the individual spectral densities:\n$$\nS_{v,s} = S_{v1} + S_{v2} = 4k_B T R_1 + 4k_B T R_2\n$$\nFactoring out the common terms, we get:\n$$\nS_{v,s} = 4k_B T (R_1 + R_2)\n$$\nThe equivalent resistance of the series network is $R_s = R_1 + R_2$. Therefore, the noise spectral density is $S_{v,s} = 4k_B T R_s$, which is consistent with the noise of the equivalent resistor.\n\n**Option B: Parallel Configuration**\n\nIn the parallel configuration, the analysis is more conveniently performed using the Norton equivalent noise model. A resistor $R$ at temperature $T$ can be modeled as an ideal noiseless resistor in parallel with a noise current source, $i_n$. The spectral density of this current source, $S_i$, is related to the voltage spectral density by $S_i = S_v / R^2$.\n$$\nS_i(f) = \\frac{4k_B T R}{R^2} = 4k_B T \\frac{1}{R} = 4k_B T G\n$$\nwhere $G = 1/R$ is the conductance.\n\nFor the parallel combination of $R_1$ and $R_2$, the total noise current $i_{n,p}$ is the sum of the individual uncorrelated noise currents, $i_{n1}$ and $i_{n2}$. The total current noise spectral density, $S_{i,p}$, is the sum of the individual densities:\n$$\nS_{i,p} = S_{i1} + S_{i2} = 4k_B T G_1 + 4k_B T G_2 = 4k_B T \\left(\\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2}\\right)\n$$\nThis total noise current source is in parallel with the equivalent resistance of the parallel network, $R_p$.\n$$\nR_p = \\left(\\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2}\\right)^{-1} = \\frac{R_1 R_2}{R_1 + R_2}\n$$\nTo find the open-circuit voltage noise spectral density, $S_{v,p}$, we use the relationship between the Norton and Thévenin equivalents. The open-circuit voltage is $v_{n,p} = i_{n,p} R_p$. The corresponding relationship for the spectral densities is $S_{v,p} = S_{i,p} R_p^2$.\n$$\nS_{v,p} = \\left[ 4k_B T \\left(\\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2}\\right) \\right] \\left( \\frac{R_1 R_2}{R_1 + R_2} \\right)^2\n$$\nSubstituting $\\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2} = \\frac{R_1 + R_2}{R_1 R_2}$:\n$$\nS_{v,p} = 4k_B T \\left( \\frac{R_1 + R_2}{R_1 R_2} \\right) \\frac{(R_1 R_2)^2}{(R_1 + R_2)^2} = 4k_B T \\frac{R_1 R_2}{R_1 + R_2}\n$$\nThis is $S_{v,p} = 4k_B T R_p$, which is again consistent with the noise of the equivalent resistor.\n\n**Calculation of the Ratio**\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio of the series-case open-circuit voltage noise spectral density to the parallel-case open-circuit voltage noise spectral density. Let this ratio be $\\mathcal{R}$.\n$$\n\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{S_{v,s}}{S_{v,p}} = \\frac{4k_B T (R_1 + R_2)}{4k_B T \\frac{R_1 R_2}{R_1 + R_2}}\n$$\nThe term $4k_B T$ cancels, indicating the ratio is independent of temperature.\n$$\n\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{R_1 + R_2}{\\frac{R_1 R_2}{R_1 + R_2}} = \\frac{(R_1 + R_2)^2}{R_1 R_2}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $R_1 = 80\\,\\Omega$ and $R_2 = 20\\,\\Omega$.\n$$\nR_1 + R_2 = 80 + 20 = 100\\,\\Omega\n$$\n$$\nR_1 R_2 = 80 \\times 20 = 1600\\,\\Omega^2\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for the ratio $\\mathcal{R}$:\n$$\n\\mathcal{R} = \\frac{(100)^2}{1600} = \\frac{10000}{1600} = \\frac{100}{16} = \\frac{25}{4} = 6.25\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\mathcal{R} = 6.250\n$$",

            "solution": "The problem requires determining the device width that achieves an input match and then computing the transconductance and noise figure from first principles. The base facts are the square-law strong-inversion model, the small-signal transconductance definition, and the thermal noise spectral density model for MOSFET channel noise.\n\nWe first justify the input impedance approximation for the common-gate Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET). With the gate at radio-frequency (RF) ground, the small-signal drain current is $i_{d} = g_{m} v_{gs}$ where $v_{gs}$ is the gate-to-source voltage. For a small input voltage applied at the source, $v_{in} = v_{s}$, and with the gate grounded, $v_{gs} = -v_{s}$. If the drain is also RF-grounded by an ideal load network (cascode or tuned load), the small-signal input current at the source is approximately equal to the drain current, so $i_{in} \\approx i_{d} = g_{m} v_{s} = g_{m} v_{in}$. Therefore, the input admittance is $Y_{in} \\approx g_{m}$ and the input impedance is\n$$\nZ_{in} \\approx \\frac{1}{g_{m}}.\n$$\nThis relies on the assumptions in the problem that reactive effects are negligible compared with the transconductance at $f = 3\\,\\mathrm{GHz}$, i.e., $\\omega C_{gd} \\ll g_{m}$ and $\\omega C_{gs} \\ll g_{m}$, so that the input conductance dominates, and that the drain is effectively at RF ground over the narrowband of interest.\n\nTo meet the target input match $Z_{in} \\approx 50\\,\\Omega$ with the source resistance $R_{s} = 50\\,\\Omega$, we set\n$$\n\\frac{1}{g_{m}} \\approx R_{s} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad g_{m} \\approx \\frac{1}{R_{s}}.\n$$\nHence, the required transconductance is\n$$\ng_{m,\\mathrm{req}} = \\frac{1}{50\\,\\Omega} = 0.02\\,\\mathrm{S}.\n$$\n\nNext, we relate $g_{m}$ to the device dimensions and bias current from the square-law model.

The output signal power is $S_{\\text{out}} = G S_{\\text{in}}$, where $G$ is the available power gain of the network. The total output noise power, $N_{\\text{out}}$, is the sum of the amplified input noise and the noise added by the network itself, $N_{\\text{add}}$: $N_{\\text{out}} = G N_{\\textin} + N_{\\text{add}}$.\n\nSubstituting these into the definition of $F$:\n$$ F = \\frac{S_{\\text{in}} / (k_B T_0 B)}{(G S_{\\text{in}}) / (G k_B T_0 B + N_{\\text{add}})} = \\frac{G k_B T_0 B + N_{\\text{add}}}{G k_B T_0 B} = 1 + \\frac{N_{\\text{add}}}{G k_B T_0 B} $$\nThis expression shows that the noise factor quantifies the excess noise, $N_{\\text{add}}$, contributed by the network, normalized to the amplified input noise.\n\nThe measurement setup can be modeled as a cascade of two networks:\n1.  The pre-DUT path (cable and attenuator), which is a passive network with insertion loss $L$ and is at a physical temperature $T_p = T_0$.\n2.  The Device Under Test (DUT), the LNA, with its intrinsic noise factor $F_{\\text{DUT}}$ and gain $G_{\\text{DUT}}$.\n\nFor the first network (the pre-DUT path), being a passive attenuator, its available power gain $G_1$ is the reciprocal of its loss $L$:\n$$ G_1 = \\frac{1}{L} $$\nA fundamental result of thermodynamics and noise theory states that a passive network with loss $L$ at a physical temperature $T_p$ adds noise power equivalent to that of a resistor of the same value. Its noise factor, $F_1$, when referenced to the standard temperature $T_0$, is given by:\n$$ F_1 = 1 + (L-1)\\frac{T_p}{T_0} $$\nIn this problem, it is given that the pre-DUT path is at $T_p = T_0 = 290\\,\\mathrm{K}$. Therefore, the noise factor of the pre-DUT path simplifies to:\n$$ F_1 = 1 + (L-1)\\frac{T_0}{T_0} = 1 + L - 1 = L $$\nSo, for the first stage, we have $F_1 = L$ and $G_1 = 1/L$. The second stage is the DUT, with noise factor $F_2 = F_{\\text{DUT}}$.\n\nThe overall noise factor of a cascade of networks is given by the Friis formula:\n$$ F_{\\text{cascade}} = F_1 + \\frac{F_2 - 1}{G_1} + \\frac{F_3 - 1}{G_1 G_2} + \\dots $$\nFor our two-stage system, the measured cascade noise factor, $F_{\\text{meas}}$, is:\n$$ F_{\\text{meas}} = F_1 + \\frac{F_2 - 1}{G_1} $$\nHere, $F_2 = F_{\\text{DUT}}$. Substituting the expressions for $F_1$ and $G_1$:\n$$ F_{\\text{meas}} = L + \\frac{F_{\\text{DUT}} - 1}{1/L} $$\n\nThis equation explains the corruption of the measurement. The pre-DUT path contributes noise in two ways:\n1.  It adds its own thermal noise, represented by the term $F_1 = L$. Since $L  1$ for a lossy network, this term is greater than unity, directly increasing the total noise factor.\n2.  It attenuates the signal and the source noise passing through it. The gain $G_1 = 1/L$ is less than unity. The Friis formula shows that the noise contribution of the second stage, $(F_{\\text{DUT}} - 1)$, is divided by the gain of the first stage. Since $G_1  1$, the contribution of the DUT's noise to the total cascade noise is effectively amplified by a factor of $L$. The term becomes $L(F_{\\text{DUT}} - 1)$.\n\nTo find the intrinsic noise factor of the DUT, $F_{\\text{DUT}}$, we must rearrange the cascade equation.\n$$ F_{\\text{meas}} = L + L(F_{\\text{DUT}} - 1) $$\n$$ F_{\\text{meas}} = L + L \\cdot F_{\\text{DUT}} - L $$\n$$ F_{\\text{meas}} = L \\cdot F_{\\text{DUT}} $$\nThis remarkably simple relationship holds because the lossy network is at the standard reference temperature $T_0$. From this, we derive the de-embedding expression for $F_{\\text{DUT}}$:\n$$ F_{\\text{DUT}} = \\frac{F_{\\text{meas}}}{L} $$\n\nNow we can evaluate this expression numerically. The given measured noise figure is in decibels: $\\mathrm{NF}_{\\text{meas}} = 2.8\\,\\mathrm{dB}$. We must convert this to a linear noise factor $F_{\\text{meas}}$ using the relation $F = 10^{\\mathrm{NF}/10}$.\n$$ F_{\\text{meas}} = 10^{2.8/10} = 10^{0.28} $$\nThe insertion loss is given as a linear factor $L = 1.3$.\nPlugging these values into our derived expression:\n$$ F_{\\text{DUT}} = \\frac{10^{0.28}}{1.3} $$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$ F_{\\text{DUT}} \\approx \\frac{1.90546}{1.3} \\approx 1.465739... $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get:\n$$ F_{\\text{DUT}} \\approx 1.466 $$\nThis is the true, intrinsic noise factor of the LNA, corrected for the effects of the preceding losses. As expected, the intrinsic noise factor $F_{\\text{DUT}} \\approx 1.466$ (which corresponds to an NF of $1.66\\,\\mathrm{dB}$) is lower than the measured cascade noise factor $F_{\\text{meas}} \\approx 1.905$ (or $\\mathrm{NF}_{\\text{meas}} = 2.8\\,\\mathrm{dB}$).",
