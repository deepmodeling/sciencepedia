The provided values are physically realistic for a silicon-based device. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information for a unique solution without any internal contradictions. The language is objective and precise. The problem is directly relevant to the specified topic of long-channel MOSFET modeling.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. We proceed with the solution.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Ideal Threshold Voltage $V_{T,\\mathrm{ideal}}$\n\nThe threshold voltage is the gate-to-source voltage $V_{GS}$ required to create a conducting channel. With the source and substrate connected to ground, $V_{GS} = V_{G}$. The applied gate voltage $V_G$ is balanced by the potential drops across the MOS structure. For an ideal device (no fixed or trapped charges), the voltage balance is established by considering the flat-band voltage, $V_{FB,\\mathrm{ideal}}$, which is the voltage needed to counteract the work function difference between the metal gate and the semiconductor, $\\phi_{ms} = \\phi_m - \\phi_{Si}$.\n$$V_{FB,\\mathrm{ideal}} = \\phi_{ms} = \\phi_m - \\phi_{Si}$$\nAny additional applied voltage beyond $V_{FB,\\mathrm{ideal}}$ creates a potential drop across the oxide, $V_{ox}$, and band bending in the semiconductor, represented by the surface potential $\\psi_s$.\n$$V_G - V_{FB,\\mathrm{ideal}} = V_{ox} + \\psi_s$$\nThe voltage across the oxide is related to the total charge per unit area in the silicon, $Q_{Si}$, by the oxide capacitance per unit area, $C_{ox}$. By Gauss's law, $V_{ox} = -Q_{Si}/C_{ox}$. The negative sign arises because a positive gate voltage for an n-channel device induces negative charge ($Q_{Si}  0$) in the p-type silicon substrate. Substituting this into the voltage balance equation gives:\n$$V_G = V_{FB,\\mathrm{ideal}} + \\psi_s - \\frac{Q_{Si}}{C_{ox}}$$\nThe threshold condition is defined by the onset of strong inversion, where the surface is as strongly n-type as the bulk is p-type, which corresponds to a surface potential of $\\psi_s = 2\\phi_F$. At this point, the inversion layer charge is still negligible, so the total silicon charge is approximated by the depletion charge, $Q_{Si} \\approx Q_{d}$. Therefore, at threshold, $V_G = V_{T,\\mathrm{ideal}}$.\n$$V_{T,\\mathrm{ideal}} = V_{FB,\\mathrm{ideal}} + 2\\phi_F - \\frac{Q_{d}(2\\phi_F)}{C_{ox}}$$\nThe depletion charge $Q_{d}(2\\phi_F)$ is the charge of the ionized acceptors in the depletion region of width $W_{d,max}$ under a surface potential $\\psi_s = 2\\phi_F$. From the one-dimensional Poisson equation under the depletion approximation, the depletion width $W_d$ is related to the surface potential by $W_d = \\sqrt{2\\epsilon_{Si}\\psi_s / (qN_A)}$. The depletion charge is $Q_d = -qN_A W_d$.\nAt threshold, the depletion charge reaches its maximum value for inversion:\n$$Q_{d}(2\\phi_F) = -qN_A \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\epsilon_{Si}(2\\phi_F)}{qN_A}} = -\\sqrt{2q\\epsilon_{Si}N_A(2\\phi_F)}$$\nThis charge is negative. We are asked to express the formula in terms of its magnitude, $|Q_d(2\\phi_F)| = \\sqrt{2q\\epsilon_{Si}N_A(2\\phi_F)}$. Substituting $Q_d(2\\phi_F) = -|Q_d(2\\phi_F)|$ into the expression for $V_{T,\\mathrm{ideal}}$:\n$$V_{T,\\mathrm{ideal}} = V_{FB,\\mathrm{ideal}} + 2\\phi_F - \\frac{-|Q_d(2\\phi_F)|}{C_{ox}} = V_{FB,\\mathrm{ideal}} + 2\\phi_F + \\frac{|Q_d(2\\phi_F)|}{C_{ox}}$$\nSubstituting $V_{FB, \\mathrm{ideal}}=\\phi_m-\\phi_{Si}$, we arrive at the desired expression:\n$$V_{T,\\mathrm{ideal}} = (\\phi_m - \\phi_{Si}) + 2\\phi_F + \\frac{|Q_d(2\\phi_F)|}{C_{ox}}$$\nThis completes the derivation as requested.\n\n### Part 2: Calculation of the Effective Fixed Oxide Charge Density $Q_{eff}$\n\nTo calculate $V_{T,\\mathrm{ideal}}$, we first need to determine the values of $\\phi_F$ and $\\phi_{Si}$. The thermal voltage at $T=300$ K is $\\phi_T = kT/q$. Using $k \\approx 1.3806 \\times 10^{-23}$ J/K:\n$$\\phi_T = \\frac{k T}{q} = \\frac{(1.3806 \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J/K})(300 \\text{ K})}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ C}} \\approx 0.02585 \\text{ V}$$\nThe Fermi potential $\\phi_F$ for the p-type substrate is given by:\n$$\\phi_F = \\phi_T \\ln\\left(\\frac{N_A}{n_i}\\right) = (0.02585 \\text{ V}) \\ln\\left(\\frac{1.00 \\times 10^{16}}{1.00 \\times 10^{10}}\\right) = (0.02585 \\text{ V}) \\ln(10^6) \\approx 0.3571 \\text{ V}$$\nThe silicon work function $\\phi_{Si}$ is the energy required to move an electron from the Fermi level to vacuum. For a p-type semiconductor, using the convention where energies in eV are numerically treated as voltages, it is given by:\n$$\\phi_{Si} = \\chi + \\frac{E_g}{2} + \\phi_F$$\n$$\\phi_{Si} = 4.05 \\text{ V} + \\frac{1.12}{2} \\text{ V} + 0.3571 \\text{ V} = 4.05 + 0.56 + 0.3571 = 4.9671 \\text{ V}$$\nThe ideal flat-band voltage is the work function difference:\n$$V_{FB,\\mathrm{ideal}} = \\phi_m - \\phi_{Si} = 4.70 \\text{ V} - 4.9671 \\text{ V} = -0.2671 \\text{ V}$$\nNext, we calculate the magnitude of the depletion charge at threshold. The silicon permittivity is $\\epsilon_{Si} = 11.7 \\times 8.854 \\times 10^{-14} \\text{ F/cm} = 1.036 \\times 10^{-12}$ F/cm.\n$$|Q_d(2\\phi_F)| = \\sqrt{2q\\epsilon_{Si}N_A(2\\phi_F)} = \\sqrt{2(1.602 \\times 10^{-19})(1.036 \\times 10^{-12})(1.00 \\times 10^{16})(2 \\times 0.3571)}$$\n$$|Q_d(2\\phi_F)| = \\sqrt{2.373 \\times 10^{-15}} \\approx 4.871 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ C/cm}^2$$\nNow, we can compute the ideal threshold voltage:\n$$V_{T,\\mathrm{ideal}} = V_{FB,\\mathrm{ideal}} + 2\\phi_F + \\frac{|Q_d(2\\phi_F)|}{C_{ox}}$$\n$$V_{T,\\mathrm{ideal}} = -0.2671 \\text{ V} + 2(0.3571 \\text{ V}) + \\frac{4.871 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ C/cm}^2}{7.00 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ F/cm}^2}$$\n$$V_{T,\\mathrm{ideal}} = -0.2671 + 0.7142 + 0.06959 \\approx 0.5167 \\text{ V}$$\nThe presence of a fixed oxide charge $Q_{eff}$ at the interface modifies the threshold voltage. The charge $Q_{eff}$ contributes to the electric field in the oxide, introducing a voltage shift. The measured threshold voltage $V_{T,\\mathrm{meas}}$ is related to the ideal one by:\n$$V_{T,\\mathrm{meas}} = V_{T,\\mathrm{ideal}} - \\frac{Q_{eff}}{C_{ox}}$$\nThe voltage shift $\\Delta V_T$ is $\\Delta V_T = V_{T,\\mathrm{meas}} - V_{T,\\mathrm{ideal}} = -Q_{eff}/C_{ox}$. We can solve for $Q_{eff}$:\n$$Q_{eff} = -C_{ox}(V_{T,\\mathrm{meas}} - V_{T,\\mathrm{ideal}})$$\nUsing the given $V_{T,\\mathrm{meas}} = 0.450$ V and our calculated $V_{T,\\mathrm{ideal}}$:\n$$Q_{eff} = -(7.00 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ F/cm}^2)(0.450 \\text{ V} - 0.5167 \\text{ V})$$\n$$Q_{eff} = -(7.00 \\times 10^{-7})(-0.0667) = 4.669 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ C/cm}^2$$\nRounding to three significant figures, we get $Q_{eff} = 4.67 \\times 10^{-8}$ C/cm$^{2}$.\n\n### Part 3: Plausibility Assessment\n\nThe calculated effective fixed oxide charge density $Q_{eff}$ is positive. This is physically consistent with the properties of the Si-SiO$_2$ interface, where $Q_{eff}$ is typically positive due to structural defects related to incompletely oxidized silicon ions near the interface. A positive $Q_{eff}$ helps to attract electrons to the silicon surface, which lowers the gate voltage required to achieve inversion, thus reducing the threshold voltage. Our result, where $V_{T,\\mathrm{meas}}  V_{T,\\mathrm{ideal}}$, is consistent with a positive $Q_{eff}$.\n\nTo assess the magnitude, we can convert $Q_{eff}$ to the number of elementary charges per unit area, $N_{eff}$:\n$$N_{eff} = \\frac{|Q_{eff}|}{q} = \\frac{4.67 \\times 10^{-8} \\text{ C/cm}^2}{1.602 \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ C}} \\approx 2.91 \\times 10^{11} \\text{ cm}^{-2}$$\nFor high-quality, modern silicon manufacturing processes, the fixed oxide charge density is typically in the range of $10^{10}$ to a few times $10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$. The calculated value of $2.91 \\times 10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ falls within this physically plausible range. While it is on the higher side for a state-of-the-art logic process, it is a very reasonable value for many contemporary silicon processes. Therefore, the magnitude and sign of the extracted $Q_{eff}$ are physically plausible.",

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of Drain Current Equations**\n\nWe begin from fundamental principles. Let $y$ be the position along the channel from the source ($y=0$) to the drain ($y=L$). The channel potential at position $y$ is $V(y)$, with boundary conditions $V(0)=0$ and $V(L)=V_{DS}$. Under the charge-sheet approximation in strong inversion, the mobile electron charge density per unit area in the channel is given by:\n$$Q_n(y) = -C_{ox}[V_{GS} - V_T - V(y)]$$\nThe drift current $I_D$ is constant along the channel. It is given by the product of the channel width $W$, the magnitude of the charge density per unit length $|Q_n(y)|$, and the electron drift velocity $v_n(y)$.\n$$I_D = W |Q_n(y)| v_n(y)$$\nThe electron drift velocity is proportional to the electric field along the channel, $E_y = -dV(y)/dy$. The velocity is $v_n(y) = -\\mu_n E_y = \\mu_n \\frac{dV(y)}{dy}$. Substituting the expressions for $|Q_n(y)|$ and $v_n(y)$:\n$$I_D = W \\left(C_{ox}[V_{GS} - V_T - V(y)]\\right) \\left(\\mu_n \\frac{dV(y)}{dy}\\right)$$\nWe rearrange and integrate along the channel length:\n$$\\int_0^L I_D dy = \\int_0^{V_{DS}} W \\mu_n C_{ox} [V_{GS} - V_T - V(y)] dV(y)$$\nSince $I_D$ is constant with $y$, we perform the integration:\n$$I_D L = W \\mu_n C_{ox} \\left[ (V_{GS} - V_T)V - \\frac{1}{2}V^2 \\right]_0^{V_{DS}}$$\n$$I_D L = W \\mu_n C_{ox} \\left[ (V_{GS} - V_T)V_{DS} - \\frac{1}{2}V_{DS}^2 \\right]$$\nThis gives the drain current in the **linear (or triode) region**, valid for $0 \\le V_{DS} \\le V_{GS} - V_T$:\n$$I_{D,lin} = \\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} \\left[ (V_{GS} - V_T)V_{DS} - \\frac{1}{2}V_{DS}^2 \\right]$$\nThe **saturation region** begins when $V_{DS}$ reaches the pinch-off voltage, $V_{DS,sat} = V_{GS} - V_T$. For $V_{DS} \\ge V_{DS,sat}$, the long-channel model assumes the current saturates at the value $I_{D,sat}$, which is found by substituting $V_{DS} = V_{GS} - V_T$ into the linear-region equation:\n$$I_{D,sat} = \\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} \\left[ (V_{GS} - V_T)(V_{GS} - V_T) - \\frac{1}{2}(V_{GS} - V_T)^2 \\right]$$\n$$I_{D,sat} = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} (V_{GS} - V_T)^2$$\n\n**Numerical Evaluation of Drain Current**\n\nFirst, we calculate the device transconductance parameter, $k_n = \\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L}$:\n$$k_n = (0.05~\\mathrm{m}^{2}/\\mathrm{V}\\cdot\\mathrm{s})(3.5 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{F/m}^{2})\\left(\\frac{10~\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{1~\\mu\\mathrm{m}}\\right) = 1.75 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{A/V}^2$$\nThe overdrive voltage is $V_{OV} = V_{GS} - V_T = 0.75~\\mathrm{V} - 0.45~\\mathrm{V} = 0.30~\\mathrm{V}$. The saturation drain voltage is $V_{DS,sat} = V_{OV} = 0.30~\\mathrm{V}$.\n\n- **At Bias Point 1 ($V_{DS} = 0.10~\\mathrm{V}$)**:\nSince $V_{DS}  V_{DS,sat}$, the device is in the linear region.\n$$I_{D,1} = k_n \\left[ V_{OV}V_{DS} - \\frac{1}{2}V_{DS}^2 \\right]$$\n$$I_{D,1} = (1.75 \\times 10^{-3}) \\left[ (0.30)(0.10) - \\frac{1}{2}(0.10)^2 \\right] = (1.75 \\times 10^{-3}) [0.03 - 0.005]$$\n$$I_{D,1} = (1.75 \\times 10^{-3})(0.025) = 4.375 \\times 10^{-5}~\\mathrm{A} = 43.75~\\mu\\mathrm{A}$$\n\n- **At Bias Point 2 ($V_{DS} = 0.35~\\mathrm{V}$)**:\nSince $V_{DS}  V_{DS,sat}$, the device is in the saturation region.\n$$I_{D,2} = \\frac{1}{2} k_n V_{OV}^2 = \\frac{1}{2} (1.75 \\times 10^{-3}) (0.30)^2$$\n$$I_{D,2} = (0.5)(1.75 \\times 10^{-3})(0.09) = 7.875 \\times 10^{-5}~\\mathrm{A} = 78.75~\\mu\\mathrm{A}$$\n\n**First-Order Model and Evaluation**\n\nThe first-order model $I_{D}^{(1)}$ is obtained by linearizing the current equation about $V_{DS}=0$. We use a first-order Taylor expansion of the linear region equation for $I_D(V_{DS})$:\n$$I_{D}^{(1)}(V_{DS}) = I_D(0) + \\left. \\frac{dI_D}{dV_{DS}} \\right|_{V_{DS}=0} \\cdot V_{DS}$$\nFrom the linear region equation, $I_D(0)=0$. The derivative is:\n$$\\frac{dI_D}{dV_{DS}} = \\frac{d}{dV_{DS}} \\left( k_n \\left[ V_{OV}V_{DS} - \\frac{1}{2}V_{DS}^2 \\right] \\right) = k_n [V_{OV} - V_{DS}]$$\nEvaluating at $V_{DS}=0$:\n$$\\left. \\frac{dI_D}{dV_{DS}} \\right|_{V_{DS}=0} = k_n V_{OV}$$\nThus, the first-order model is:\n$$I_{D}^{(1)}(V_{DS}) = (k_n V_{OV}) V_{DS}$$\nWe calculate the coefficient $k_n V_{OV}$:\n$$k_n V_{OV} = (1.75 \\times 10^{-3}~\\mathrm{A/V}^2)(0.30~\\mathrm{V}) = 5.25 \\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{A/V}$$\nNow, we evaluate $I_{D}^{(1)}$ at the two bias points.

Rounding this decimal value to four significant figures gives $1.333$.\nThe large deviation at the saturation point is expected, as the first-order linear model is only accurate for $V_{DS} \\ll V_{OV}$ and completely fails to capture the current saturation phenomenon.",

Assume the gradual channel approximation and neglect body depletion charge modulation, overlap capacitances, channel length modulation, and velocity saturation.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the established theory of MOSFET operation, well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and expressed in objective, formal language. While the problem provides information about the Ward-Dutton charge partitioning scheme, the quantities to be calculated, $C_{gs}$ and $C_{gd}$, are defined based on derivatives of the total gate charge $Q_g$, which is independent of the charge partitioning. This makes the inclusion of the Ward-Dutton scheme superfluous for the calculation as defined. However, the problem is not rendered invalid, as a rigorous solution can be constructed that formally utilizes all given information. We will proceed to derive the solution, explicitly showing the role of each given component.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. First, we derive the small-signal capacitances in the linear region. Second, we analyze the gate-to-drain capacitance in the saturation region.\n\n**Part 1: Linear Region Capacitances ($C_{gs}$, $C_{gd}$)**\n\nThe source is at the reference potential, so $V_S=0$. The gate-to-source voltage is $V_{GS}$ and the drain-to-source voltage is $V_{DS}$. The device operates in the linear region, where $V_{DS}  V_{GS} - V_{T}$.\n\nThe channel potential $V(x)$ at a position $x$ from the source ($x=0$) to the drain ($x=L$) is approximated as a linear function:\n$$V(x) = \\frac{V_{DS}}{L} x$$\nThe inversion charge per unit area, $q_i(x)$, under the charge-sheet approximation is given by:\n$$q_i(x) = -C_{ox}\\big(V_{GS} - V_{T} - V(x)\\big)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $V(x)$:\n$$q_i(x) = -C_{ox}\\left(V_{GS} - V_{T} - \\frac{V_{DS}}{L}x\\right)$$\nThe total inversion charge in the channel, $Q_I$, is the integral of $q_i(x)$ over the gate area ($W \\times L$):\n$$Q_I = \\int_{0}^{L} W q_i(x) \\,dx = -W C_{ox} \\int_{0}^{L} \\left(V_{GS} - V_{T} - \\frac{V_{DS}}{L}x\\right) \\,dx$$\n$$Q_I = -W C_{ox} \\left[ (V_{GS} - V_{T})x - \\frac{V_{DS}}{2L}x^2 \\right]_0^L = -WLC_{ox}\\left(V_{GS} - V_{T} - \\frac{V_{DS}}{2}\\right)$$\nThe problem defines the total gate charge (associated with the inversion layer) as $Q_g = -\\int_0^L W q_i(x) \\,dx = -Q_I$. Therefore:\n$$Q_g = WLC_{ox}\\left(V_{GS} - V_{T} - \\frac{V_{DS}}{2}\\right)$$\nThe problem explicitly instructs to use the Ward-Dutton (WD) charge partition scheme. This scheme divides the total inversion charge $Q_I$ between the source and drain terminals. Let $Q_S$ and $Q_D$ be the portions of the channel charge attributed to the source and drain, respectively.\n$$Q_S = \\int_0^L W q_i(x) w_s(x) \\,dx$$\n$$Q_D = \\int_0^L W q_i(x) w_d(x) \\,dx$$\nwhere the weighting functions are given as $w_s(x) = 1 - \\frac{x}{L}$ and $w_d(x) = \\frac{x}{L}$.\n\nLet's calculate $Q_S$:\n$$Q_S = \\int_0^L W \\left[-C_{ox}\\left(V_{GS} - V_{T} - \\frac{V_{DS}}{L}x\\right)\\right] \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{L}\\right) \\,dx$$\n$$Q_S = -WC_{ox} \\int_0^L \\left( (V_{GS}-V_{T}) - \\left(\\frac{V_{DS}}{L} + \\frac{V_{GS}-V_{T}}{L}\\right)x + \\frac{V_{DS}}{L^2}x^2 \\right) \\,dx$$\n$$Q_S = -WC_{ox} \\left[ (V_{GS}-V_{T})x - \\frac{1}{2L}\\left(V_{DS} + V_{GS}-V_{T}\\right)x^2 + \\frac{V_{DS}}{3L^2}x^3 \\right]_0^L$$\n$$Q_S = -WC_{ox} \\left( (V_{GS}-V_{T})L - \\frac{L}{2}(V_{DS} + V_{GS}-V_{T}) + \\frac{V_{DS}L}{3} \\right)$$\n$$Q_S = -WLC_{ox} \\left( (V_{GS}-V_{T}) - \\frac{1}{2}(V_{GS}-V_{T}) - \\frac{V_{DS}}{2} + \\frac{V_{DS}}{3} \\right)$$\n$$Q_S = -WLC_{ox} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}(V_{GS}-V_{T}) - \\frac{1}{6}V_{DS} \\right)$$\nSimilarly, for $Q_D$:\n$$Q_D = \\int_0^L W \\left[-C_{ox}\\left(V_{GS} - V_{T} - \\frac{V_{DS}}{L}x\\right)\\right] \\left(\\frac{x}{L}\\right) \\,dx$$\n$$Q_D = -\\frac{WC_{ox}}{L} \\int_0^L \\left( (V_{GS}-V_{T})x - \\frac{V_{DS}}{L}x^2 \\right) \\,dx$$\n$$Q_D = -\\frac{WC_{ox}}{L} \\left[ \\frac{1}{2}(V_{GS}-V_{T})x^2 - \\frac{V_{DS}}{3L}x^3 \\right]_0^L$$\n$$Q_D = -\\frac{WC_{ox}}{L} \\left( \\frac{L^2}{2}(V_{GS}-V_{T}) - \\frac{L^2}{3}V_{DS} \\right)$$\n$$Q_D = -WLC_{ox} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}(V_{GS}-V_{T}) - \\frac{1}{3}V_{DS} \\right)$$\nWe can verify that $Q_S+Q_D = -WLC_{ox}(V_{GS}-V_{T} - \\frac{V_{DS}}{2}) = Q_I$, confirming the charge conservation of the partitioning scheme. Since $Q_g = -Q_I$, we have $Q_g = -(Q_S+Q_D)$.\n\nThe capacitances are defined as $C_{gs} \\equiv -\\frac{\\partial Q_{g}}{\\partial V_{s}}$ and $C_{gd} \\equiv -\\frac{\\partial Q_{g}}{\\partial V_{d}}$. The derivatives are taken with all other terminal voltages held constant. We treat $V_G, V_D, V_S, V_B$ as independent terminal voltages. The charge $Q_g$ is a function of the voltage differences $V_{GS}=V_G-V_S$ and $V_{DS}=V_D-V_S$.\nUsing the chain rule, we find the derivative with respect to $V_S$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial Q_g}{\\partial V_S}\\bigg|_{V_G, V_D, V_B} = \\frac{\\partial Q_g}{\\partial V_{GS}}\\frac{\\partial V_{GS}}{\\partial V_S} + \\frac{\\partial Q_g}{\\partial V_{DS}}\\frac{\\partial V_{DS}}{\\partial V_S} = \\frac{\\partial Q_g}{\\partial V_{GS}}(-1) + \\frac{\\partial Q_g}{\\partial V_{DS}}(-1) = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial Q_g}{\\partial V_{GS}} + \\frac{\\partial Q_g}{\\partial V_{DS}}\\right)$$\nThus, the gate-to-source capacitance is:\n$$C_{gs} = -\\frac{\\partial Q_g}{\\partial V_S} = \\frac{\\partial Q_g}{\\partial V_{GS}} + \\frac{\\partial Q_g}{\\partial V_{DS}}$$\nFor the derivative with respect to $V_D$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial Q_g}{\\partial V_D}\\bigg|_{V_G, V_S, V_B} = \\frac{\\partial Q_g}{\\partial V_{GS}}\\frac{\\partial V_{GS}}{\\partial V_D} + \\frac{\\partial Q_g}{\\partial V_{DS}}\\frac{\\partial V_{DS}}{\\partial V_D} = \\frac{\\partial Q_g}{\\partial V_{GS}}(0) + \\frac{\\partial Q_g}{\\partial V_{DS}}(1) = \\frac{\\partial Q_g}{\\partial V_{DS}}$$\nThus, the gate-to-drain capacitance is:\n$$C_{gd} = -\\frac{\\partial Q_g}{\\partial V_D} = -\\frac{\\partial Q_g}{\\partial V_{DS}}$$\nWe now compute the partial derivatives of $Q_g(V_{GS}, V_{DS}) = WLC_{ox}\\left(V_{GS} - V_{T} - \\frac{V_{DS}}{2}\\right)$.\n$$\\frac{\\partial Q_g}{\\partial V_{GS}} = WLC_{ox}$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial Q_g}{\\partial V_{DS}} = -\\frac{WLC_{ox}}{2}$$\nSubstituting these into the expressions for the capacitances:\n$$C_{gd} = -\\left(-\\frac{WLC_{ox}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}WLC_{ox}$$\n$$C_{gs} = WLC_{ox} + \\left(-\\frac{WLC_{ox}}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}WLC_{ox}$$\nThe total gate capacitance is $C_{ox}^{total} = WLC_{ox}$. Thus, in the linear region, we have:\n$$C_{gs} = \\frac{1}{2}C_{ox}^{total} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad C_{gd} = \\frac{1}{2}C_{ox}^{total}$$\nNote that these results for derivatives of the *total gate charge* are independent of the charge partitioning scheme. The same result would be obtained by directly differentiating the expression for $Q_g$ without first calculating $Q_S$ and $Q_D$.\n\n**Part 2: Saturation Region Analysis of $C_{gd}$**\n\nIn saturation, $V_{DS} \\ge V_{GS} - V_{T}$. The problem models this by defining an effective channel length $x_e$ where the channel pinches off. This point is defined by $V(x_e) = V_{GS} - V_{T}$. Using the same linear potential model $V(x) = \\frac{V_{DS}}{L}x$:\n$$\\frac{V_{DS}}{L}x_e = V_{GS} - V_{T} \\implies x_e = L \\frac{V_{GS}-V_{T}}{V_{DS}}$$\nFor $x  x_e$, the inversion charge is assumed to be negligible ($q_i(x) \\approx 0$). The total gate charge is now found by integrating only up to $x_e$:\n$$Q_g^{sat} = \\int_{0}^{x_e} W q_i(x) \\,dx = -\\int_{0}^{x_e} WC_{ox}\\left(V_{GS} - V_{T} - \\frac{V_{DS}}{L}x\\right) \\,dx$$\n$$Q_g^{sat} = WC_{ox} \\left[ (V_{GS}-V_{T})x - \\frac{V_{DS}}{2L}x^2 \\right]_0^{x_e} = WC_{ox}\\left( (V_{GS}-V_{T})x_e - \\frac{V_{DS}}{2L}x_e^2 \\right)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $x_e$:\n$$Q_g^{sat} = WC_{ox}\\left( (V_{GS}-V_{T})\\left(L\\frac{V_{GS}-V_{T}}{V_{DS}}\\right) - \\frac{V_{DS}}{2L}\\left(L\\frac{V_{GS}-V_{T}}{V_{DS}}\\right)^2 \\right)$$\n$$Q_g^{sat} = WC_{ox}\\left( L\\frac{(V_{GS}-V_{T})^2}{V_{DS}} - \\frac{V_{DS}L^2}{2L}\\frac{(V_{GS}-V_{T})^2}{V_{DS}^2} \\right)$$\n$$Q_g^{sat} = WC_{ox}\\left( L\\frac{(V_{GS}-V_{T})^2}{V_{DS}} - \\frac{L}{2}\\frac{(V_{GS}-V_{T})^2}{V_{DS}} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}WLC_{ox} \\frac{(V_{GS} - V_{T})^2}{V_{DS}}$$\nThe gate-to-drain capacitance in saturation is found using the same definition as before:\n$$C_{gd} = -\\frac{\\partial Q_g^{sat}}{\\partial V_{DS}}$$\n$$C_{gd} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_{DS}} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}WLC_{ox} (V_{GS} - V_{T})^2 V_{DS}^{-1} \\right)$$\n$$C_{gd} = - \\frac{1}{2}WLC_{ox} (V_{GS} - V_{T})^2 (-1)V_{DS}^{-2}$$\n$$C_{gd}(V_{DS}) = \\frac{1}{2}WLC_{ox} \\frac{(V_{GS} - V_{T})^2}{V_{DS}^2}$$\nThis expression for $C_{gd}$ is valid for $V_{DS} \\ge V_{GS} - V_{T}$.\nAt the onset of saturation, $V_{DS} = V_{GS} - V_{T}$, which gives $C_{gd} = \\frac{1}{2}WLC_{ox}$. This matches the value from the linear region, ensuring continuity of the model. As $V_{DS}$ increases further into saturation, the term $V_{DS}^2$ in the denominator causes $C_{gd}$ to decrease rapidly towards zero. This models the decoupling of the gate from the drain terminal once the channel is pinched off near the drain, which is a key feature of MOSFET operation in saturation.\n\nThe problem asks for the final answer to be the expressions for the linear-region capacitances only.",
