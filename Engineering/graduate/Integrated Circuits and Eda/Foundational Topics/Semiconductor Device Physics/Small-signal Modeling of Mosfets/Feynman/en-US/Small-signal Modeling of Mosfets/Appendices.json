The model is a standard, correct approximation.\n2. **Non-Formalizable or Irrelevant**: No flaws. The problem is a core topic in the specified field.\n3. **Incomplete or Contradictory Setup**: The problem is complete and self-consistent. Note: The combination of the given relations $I_{D}=W\\,q(x)\\,v(x)$, $v(x)=\\mu_{n}E(x)$, and $E(x)=-\\frac{dV(x)}{dx}$ leads to $I_D = -W \\mu_n C_{ox} (V_{GS}-V_{TH}-V(x)) \\frac{dV}{dx}$. Since all terms on the right except for the leading negative sign are positive, this would imply a negative current $I_D$ for a positive $V_{DS}$, which contradicts convention. The standard physical derivation for an n-channel device is based on electron current, $I_D = W Q_{inv}(x) v_{drift}(x)$, where $Q_{inv}(x) = C_{ox}(V_{GS}-V_{TH}-V(x))$ is the magnitude of the inversion charge and $v_{drift}(x) = \\mu_n |\\vec{E}| = \\mu_n \\frac{dV}{dx}$ is the electron drift speed. This leads to $I_D = W \\mu_n C_{ox} (V_{GS}-V_{TH}-V(x)) \\frac{dV}{dx}$.

The solution process will proceed.\n\n## Solution\n\nThe objective is to derive the drain-to-source resistance $r_{sd}$ of an n-channel MOSFET in the triode region. The derivation begins by formulating an expression for the drain current $I_D$.\n\nThe drain current $I_D$ is the total charge flowing per unit time. At a position $x$ along the channel, the differential current $dI_D$ is due to the drift of mobile inversion charge $dQ_{inv}$ in a channel segment of length $dx$. The magnitude of the inversion charge density per unit area is given as $q(x) = C_{ox}\\left(V_{GS}-V_{TH}-V(x)\\right)$. The total mobile charge in a segment of length $dx$ and width $W$ is $dQ_{inv} = q(x) \\, W \\, dx$.\n\nThe drift velocity of electrons is $v_n = \\mu_n |\\vec{E}|$. The electric field $\\vec{E}$ points from higher potential (drain) to lower potential (source), so its component along the channel is $E_x = -\\frac{dV}{dx}$. Since $V(x)$ increases from $0$ at the source to $V_{DS}$ at the drain, $\\frac{dV}{dx}$ is positive, and thus $E_x$ is negative. The drift speed is $v_n = \\mu_n |E_x| = \\mu_n \\frac{dV}{dx}$.\n\nThe current is the product of the charge per unit length, $Wq(x)$, and the carrier drift speed, $v_n$.\n$$I_D = W q(x) v_n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $q(x)$ and $v_n$:\n$$I_D = W \\left[ C_{ox}\\left(V_{GS}-V_{TH}-V(x)\\right) \\right] \\left( \\mu_n \\frac{dV(x)}{dx} \\right)$$\nIn steady-state, the current $I_D$ must be constant at any point $x$ along the channel. We can rearrange this differential equation to separate the variables $x$ and $V$.\n$$I_D \\, dx = W \\mu_n C_{ox} \\left(V_{GS}-V_{TH}-V\\right) dV$$\nTo find the total current, we integrate this expression along the entire channel length. The position $x$ ranges from $0$ to $L$, while the channel potential $V(x)$ ranges from $V(0)=0$ to $V(L)=V_{DS}$.\n$$\\int_0^L I_D \\, dx = \\int_0^{V_{DS}} W \\mu_n C_{ox} \\left(V_{GS}-V_{TH}-V\\right) dV$$\nSince $I_D$, $W$, $\\mu_n$, and $C_{ox}$ are constants with respect to the integration variables:\n$$I_D \\int_0^L dx = W \\mu_n C_{ox} \\int_0^{V_{DS}} \\left(V_{GS}-V_{TH}-V\\right) dV$$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$I_D [x]_0^L = W \\mu_n C_{ox} \\left[ (V_{GS}-V_{TH})V - \\frac{V^2}{2} \\right]_0^{V_{DS}}$$\n$$I_D (L-0) = W \\mu_n C_{ox} \\left( \\left( (V_{GS}-V_{TH})V_{DS} - \\frac{V_{DS}^2}{2} \\right) - (0) \\right)$$\nSolving for $I_D$:\n$$I_D = \\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} \\left[ (V_{GS}-V_{TH})V_{DS} - \\frac{V_{DS}^2}{2} \\right]$$\nThis is the standard expression for the drain current in the triode region, which is valid for $0 \\le V_{DS} \\le V_{GS}-V_{TH}$.\n\nNext, we find the small-signal source–drain conductance, $g_{sd}$, by taking the partial derivative of $I_D$ with respect to $V_{DS}$, holding all other parameters constant.\n$$g_{sd} = \\frac{\\partial I_{D}}{\\partial V_{DS}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_{DS}} \\left\\{ \\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} \\left[ (V_{GS}-V_{TH})V_{DS} - \\frac{V_{DS}^2}{2} \\right] \\right\\}$$\nThe term $\\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L}$ is a constant factor.\n$$g_{sd} = \\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_{DS}} \\left[ (V_{GS}-V_{TH})V_{DS} - \\frac{V_{DS}^2}{2} \\right]$$\n$$g_{sd} = \\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} \\left[ (V_{GS}-V_{TH}) \\cdot 1 - \\frac{1}{2}(2V_{DS}) \\right]$$\n$$g_{sd} = \\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} \\left( V_{GS}-V_{TH}-V_{DS} \\right)$$\nThe incremental source–drain resistance, $r_{sd}$, is the reciprocal of the conductance $g_{sd}$.\n$$r_{sd} = \\frac{1}{g_{sd}} = \\frac{1}{\\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} \\left( V_{GS}-V_{TH}-V_{DS} \\right)}$$\nThis is the final closed-form analytic expression for the small-signal resistance.\n\nDiscussion of dependencies:\n1.  **Dependence on $V_{GS}$**: The resistance $r_{sd}$ is inversely proportional to the term $V_{GS}-V_{TH}-V_{DS}$. As the gate-to-source voltage $V_{GS}$ increases, the overdrive voltage $V_{GS}-V_{TH}$ increases. This induces a stronger inversion layer (more free carriers) in the channel, making the channel more conductive. Consequently, the resistance $r_{sd}$ decreases as $V_{GS}$ increases.\n\n2.  **Dependence on $V_{DS}$**: As the drain-to-source voltage $V_{DS}$ increases, the term $V_{GS}-V_{TH}-V_{DS}$ decreases. This causes the denominator to shrink, and thus the resistance $r_{sd}$ increases. This is because a larger $V_{DS}$ reduces the gate-to-channel voltage drop near the drain end, tapering the inversion layer and \"pinching\" the channel. This reduction in charge density near the drain increases the overall channel resistance.\n\n3.  **Dependence on $W/L$**: The resistance $r_{sd}$ is inversely proportional to the geometric aspect ratio $W/L$. Increasing the channel width $W$ provides more parallel paths for current flow, thus decreasing resistance. Increasing the channel length $L$ forces the carriers to travel a longer distance, thus increasing resistance. This behavior is analogous to a classical resistor whose resistance is $R = \\rho \\frac{L}{A}$, where $W$ is related to the cross-sectional area $A$.",

            "problem": "You are given a Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) operated in saturation and asked to compare the small-signal output resistance derived from a traditional long-channel model against that derived from a short-channel model that captures Drain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL), both at the same direct-current bias. You must derive from first principles the expressions needed to compute the small-signal output resistance, then implement a program to evaluate a set of test cases. The focus is to elucidate what is being computed, why it is valid, and how it is derived from a fundamental base, without relying on shortcut formulas for small-signal parameters.\n\nFundamental base and definitions:\n- In strong inversion and saturation, under the charge-sheet approximation and drift-diffusion transport, the drain current for a long-channel MOSFET can be expressed in terms of geometry and bias. The gate overdrive is defined as $V_{\\mathrm{ov}} = V_{\\mathrm{GS}} - V_{\\mathrm{TH}}$, where $V_{\\mathrm{GS}}$ is the gate-to-source voltage and $V_{\\mathrm{TH}}$ is the threshold voltage. Channel-length modulation is represented by a coefficient $\\lambda$ that accounts for effective channel-length reduction with increasing drain-to-source voltage $V_{\\mathrm{DS}}$.\n- Short-channel effects modify the threshold voltage via DIBL, captured to first order by a linear lowering with $V_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ using a coefficient $\\eta$. The effective threshold voltage becomes $V_{\\mathrm{TH,eff}} = V_{\\mathrm{TH0}} - \\eta V_{\\mathrm{DS}}$, where $V_{\\mathrm{TH0}}$ is the zero-$V_{\\mathrm{DS}}$ threshold voltage. This increases the effective gate overdrive to $V_{\\mathrm{ov,eff}} = V_{\\mathrm{GS}} - V_{\\mathrm{TH,eff}} = V_{\\mathrm{GS}} - V_{\\mathrm{TH0}} + \\eta V_{\\mathrm{DS}}$.\n- The small-signal output resistance is defined as $r_o = \\left( \\frac{\\partial I_D}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{DS}}} \\big\\rvert_{\\text{bias}} \\right)^{-1}$, where $I_D$ is the drain current and the partial derivative is evaluated at the specified operating point. This definition follows from the general small-signal linearization of a current-voltage characteristic.\n\nStarting from these bases, the program you write must:\n1. Use the saturation-region functional form of the drain current under the long-channel assumption of fixed threshold voltage and channel-length modulation, with mobility $\\mu$, oxide capacitance per unit area $C_{\\mathrm{ox}}$, device width $W$, and device length $L$. In this context, let $K = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu C_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\frac{W}{L}$ and form $I_D(V_{\\mathrm{DS}})$ using $V_{\\mathrm{ov}}$ and $\\lambda$.\n2. Use the same functional form but replace the fixed threshold voltage by the DIBL-shifted threshold $V_{\\mathrm{TH,eff}}$ in the short-channel case, keeping the same $\\lambda$ to isolate the DIBL effect. Derive $I_D(V_{\\mathrm{DS}})$ using $V_{\\mathrm{ov,eff}}$ and $\\lambda$.\n3. Compute $g_{ds,\\text{long}} = \\frac{\\partial I_{D,\\text{long}}}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{DS}}}$ and $g_{ds,\\text{short}} = \\frac{\\partial I_{D,\\text{short}}}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{DS}}}$ using the product and chain rules directly from the functional forms in items $1$ and $2$, and then compute $r_{o,\\text{long}} = \\frac{1}{g_{ds,\\text{long}}}$ and $r_{o,\\text{short}} = \\frac{1}{g_{ds,\\text{short}}}$.\n4. Quantify the discrepancy attributable to DIBL as the fractional difference $\\Delta = \\frac{r_{o,\\text{short}} - r_{o,\\text{long}}}{r_{o,\\text{long}}}$ (a dimensionless decimal). This isolates the contribution of DIBL to output resistance reduction because the channel-length modulation parameter $\\lambda$ is held the same in both models.\n\nYour program must compute these quantities for the following test suite, ensuring saturation holds, that is $V_{\\mathrm{DS}} \\ge V_{\\mathrm{ov,eff}}$ in the short-channel case and $V_{\\mathrm{DS}} \\ge V_{\\mathrm{ov}}$ in the long-channel case:\n\n- Test case $1$ (short-channel, typical strong inversion): $\\mu = 0.045 \\ \\mathrm{m^2/(V \\cdot s)}$, $C_{\\mathrm{ox}} = 0.010 \\ \\mathrm{F/m^2}$, $W = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $L = 1.0 \\times 10^{-7} \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $V_{\\mathrm{GS}} = 0.8 \\ \\mathrm{V}$, $V_{\\mathrm{DS}} = 0.6 \\ \\mathrm{V}$, $V_{\\mathrm{TH0}} = 0.35 \\ \\mathrm{V}$, $\\lambda = 0.10 \\ \\mathrm{V^{-1}}$, $\\eta = 0.08 \\ \\mathrm{V/V}$.\n- Test case $2$ (near-threshold operation): $\\mu = 0.050 \\ \\mathrm{m^2/(V \\cdot s)}$, $C_{\\mathrm{ox}} = 0.008 \\ \\mathrm{F/m^2}$, $W = 0.5 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $L = 0.16 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $V_{\\mathrm{GS}} = 0.45 \\ \\mathrm{V}$, $V_{\\mathrm{DS}} = 0.30 \\ \\mathrm{V}$, $V_{\\mathrm{TH0}} = 0.40 \\ \\mathrm{V}$, $\\lambda = 0.06 \\ \\mathrm{V^{-1}}$, $\\eta = 0.05 \\ \\mathrm{V/V}$.\n- Test case $3$ (extreme short-channel, minimal channel-length modulation): $\\mu = 0.045 \\ \\mathrm{m^2/(V \\cdot s)}$, $C_{\\mathrm{ox}} = 0.010 \\ \\mathrm{F/m^2}$, $W = 2.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $L = 60 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $V_{\\mathrm{GS}} = 0.90 \\ \\mathrm{V}$, $V_{\\mathrm{DS}} = 0.70 \\ \\mathrm{V}$, $V_{\\mathrm{TH0}} = 0.35 \\ \\mathrm{V}$, $\\lambda = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{V^{-1}}$, $\\eta = 0.12 \\ \\mathrm{V/V}$.\n- Test case $4$ (no DIBL baseline): $\\mu = 0.050 \\ \\mathrm{m^2/(V \\cdot s)}$, $C_{\\mathrm{ox}} = 0.004 \\ \\mathrm{F/m^2}$, $W = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $L = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m}$, $V_{\\mathrm{GS}} = 0.70 \\ \\mathrm{V}$, $V_{\\mathrm{DS}} = 0.50 \\ \\mathrm{V}$, $V_{\\mathrm{TH0}} = 0.40 \\ \\mathrm{V}$, $\\lambda = 0.08 \\ \\mathrm{V^{-1}}$, $\\eta = 0.00 \\ \\mathrm{V/V}$.\n\nPhysical units:\n- Report $r_{o,\\text{long}}$ and $r_{o,\\text{short}}$ internally in $\\mathrm{\\Omega}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires a comparative analysis of the small-signal output resistance of a Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) under two different models: a traditional long-channel model and a short-channel model that incorporates Drain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL). The goal is to derive the necessary expressions from first principles and compute the fractional difference in output resistance attributable to DIBL for a given set of test cases. All devices are biased in the saturation region.\n\nThe fundamental relationship for the drain current $I_D$ of an n-channel MOSFET in the saturation region, assuming a square-law behavior, is given by:\n$$I_D = \\frac{1}{2} \\mu C_{\\mathrm{ox}} \\frac{W}{L} (V_{\\mathrm{GS}} - V_{\\mathrm{TH}})^2$$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the electron mobility, $C_{\\mathrm{ox}}$ is the gate oxide capacitance per unit area, $W$ and $L$ are the channel width and length, $V_{\\mathrm{GS}}$ is the gate-to-source voltage, and $V_{\\mathrm{TH}}$ is the threshold voltage.

Long-Channel Model Derivation**\n\nIn the long-channel model, the threshold voltage $V_{\\mathrm{TH}}$ is assumed to be constant and equal to its zero-bias value, $V_{\\mathrm{TH0}}$. The gate overdrive is $V_{\\mathrm{ov}} = V_{\\mathrm{GS}} - V_{\\mathrm{TH0}}$.

This is modeled to first order as $V_{\\mathrm{TH,eff}} = V_{\\mathrm{TH0}} - \\eta V_{\\mathrm{DS}}$, where $\\eta$ is the DIBL coefficient. The effective gate overdrive becomes a function of $V_{\\mathrm{DS}}$: $V_{\\mathrm{ov,eff}} = V_{\\mathrm{GS}} - V_{\\mathrm{TH,eff}} = V_{\\mathrm{GS}} - V_{\\mathrm{TH0}} + \\eta V_{\\mathrm{DS}}$.\n\nThe drain current expression is:\n$$I_{D,\\text{short}}(V_{\\mathrm{DS}}) = K (V_{\\mathrm{GS}} - V_{\\mathrm{TH,eff}})^2 (1 + \\lambda V_{\\mathrm{DS}}) = K (V_{\\mathrm{GS}} - V_{\\mathrm{TH0}} + \\eta V_{\\mathrm{DS}})^2 (1 + \\lambda V_{\\mathrm{DS}})$$\nTo find the output conductance, $g_{ds,\\text{short}}$, we differentiate $I_{D,\\text{short}}$ with respect to $V_{\\mathrm{DS}}$. Here, both the squared overdrive term and the CLM term depend on $V_{\\mathrm{DS}}$, so we must apply the product rule for differentiation, $\\frac{d(uv)}{dx} = u\\frac{dv}{dx} + v\\frac{du}{dx}$.\nLet $u(V_{\\mathrm{DS}}) = (V_{\\mathrm{GS}} - V_{\\mathrm{TH0}} + \\eta V_{\\mathrm{DS}})^2$ and $v(V_{\\mathrm{DS}}) = (1 + \\lambda V_{\\mathrm{DS}})$.\n$$g_{ds,\\text{short}} = \\frac{\\partial I_{D,\\text{short}}}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{DS}}} = K \\left[ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{DS}}} v + u \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{DS}}} \\right]$$\nThe individual derivatives are:\n$$\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{DS}}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{DS}}}(1 + \\lambda V_{\\mathrm{DS}}) = \\lambda$$\n$$\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{DS}}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{DS}}}(V_{\\mathrm{GS}} - V_{\\mathrm{TH0}} + \\eta V_{\\mathrm{DS}})^2 = 2(V_{\\mathrm{GS}} - V_{\\mathrm{TH0}} + \\eta V_{\\mathrm{DS}}) \\cdot \\eta$$\nSubstituting these back into the product rule expression:\n$$g_{ds,\\text{short}} = K \\left[ 2\\eta(V_{\\mathrm{GS}} - V_{\\mathrm{TH0}} + \\eta V_{\\mathrm{DS}})(1 + \\lambda V_{\\mathrm{DS}}) + (V_{\\mathrm{GS}} - V_{\\mathrm{TH0}} + \\eta V_{\\mathrm{DS}})^2 \\lambda \\right]$$\nWe can factor out the term $(V_{\\mathrm{GS}} - V_{\\mathrm{TH0}} + \\eta V_{\\mathrm{DS}})$:\n$$g_{ds,\\text{short}} = K (V_{\\mathrm{GS}} - V_{\\mathrm{TH0}} + \\eta V_{\\mathrm{DS}}) \\left[ 2\\eta(1 + \\lambda V_{\\mathrm{DS}}) + \\lambda(V_{\\mathrm{GS}} - V_{\\mathrm{TH0}} + \\eta V_{\\mathrm{DS}}) \\right]$$\nThis expression reveals two contributions to the output conductance: one from the DIBL effect (the $2\\eta$ term) and one from the traditional channel-length modulation (the $\\lambda$ term), which is now also modulated by DIBL through the effective overdrive. The output resistance is $r_{o,\\text{short}} = 1/g_{ds,\\text{short}}$.\n\n**3. Fractional Discrepancy**\n\nThe fractional discrepancy $\\Delta$ quantifies the relative change in output resistance due to the inclusion of the DIBL effect:\n$$\\Delta = \\frac{r_{o,\\text{short}} - r_{o,\\text{long}}}{r_{o,\\text{long}}} = \\frac{r_{o,\\text{short}}}{r_{o,\\text{long}}} - 1 = \\frac{g_{ds,\\text{long}}}{g_{ds,\\text{short}}} - 1$$\nThis metric isolates the impact of DIBL since $\\lambda$ is held constant between the two models. The following program implements these derived formulas to compute $\\Delta$ for the specified test cases. For each case, the saturation condition ($V_{\\mathrm{DS}} \\ge V_{\\mathrm{ov}}$) is verified to ensure the validity of the models used.",

The assumptions are standard idealizations. The provided definitions and constraints are not contradictory.\n\nThe problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 2: Solution\n\nThe problem requires us to find the value of the coupling factor $\\alpha$ that minimizes the signal dependence of the instantaneous drain-to-source conductance $g_{ds}(t)$. We begin with the specified model for the drain current.\n\nThe standard long-channel, square-law model for the drain current $I_D$ of an n-channel MOSFET operating in the triode (linear) region is given by:\n$$\nI_D = \\mu_n C_{ox} \\frac{W}{L} \\left[ (V_{GS} - V_{TH}) V_{DS} - \\frac{1}{2} V_{DS}^2 \\right]\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_n$ is the electron mobility, $C_{ox}$ is the gate oxide capacitance per unit area, $W/L$ is the aspect ratio of the transistor, $V_{GS}$ is the gate-to-source voltage, $V_{DS}$ is the drain-to-source voltage, and $V_{TH}$ is the threshold voltage. We can group the process and geometry-dependent constants into a single parameter $k = \\mu_n C_{ox} (W/L)$. The expression for the drain current becomes:\n$$\nI_D(V_{GS}, V_{DS}) = k \\left[ (V_{GS} - V_{TH}) V_{DS} - \\frac{1}{2} V_{DS}^2 \\right]\n$$\nThis equation is valid as long as the device remains in the triode region, which requires $V_{DS} < V_{GS} - V_{TH}$.\n\nThe problem defines the instantaneous small-signal conductance $g_{ds}(t)$ as the partial derivative of the drain current $I_D$ with respect to the drain-to-source voltage $V_{DS}$, evaluated at the instantaneous voltages. First, we find the general expression for this conductance by differentiating the drain current equation with respect to $V_{DS}$:\n$$\ng_{ds}(V_{GS}, V_{DS}) = \\frac{\\partial I_D}{\\partial V_{DS}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial V_{DS}} \\left( k \\left[ (V_{GS} - V_{TH}) V_{DS} - \\frac{1}{2} V_{DS}^2 \\right] \\right)\n$$\nPerforming the differentiation, we get:\n$$\ng_{ds}(V_{GS}, V_{DS}) = k [ (V_{GS} - V_{TH}) - V_{DS} ]\n$$\nThis expression gives the conductance for any pair of bias voltages $(V_{GS}, V_{DS})$ in the triode region.\n\nNext, we evaluate this conductance at the instantaneous, time-varying voltages given in the problem statement:\n-   $V_{GS}(t) = V_{GS0} + \\alpha\\,v(t)$\n-   $V_{DS}(t) = V_{DS0} + v(t)$\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the formula for $g_{ds}$:\n$$\ng_{ds}(t) = k \\left[ (V_{GS0} + \\alpha\\,v(t) - V_{TH}) - (V_{DS0} + v(t)) \\right]\n$$\nTo find the dependence of $g_{ds}(t)$ on the signal $v(t)$, we rearrange the terms:\n$$\ng_{ds}(t) = k \\left[ (V_{GS0} - V_{TH} - V_{DS0}) + (\\alpha\\,v(t) - v(t)) \\right]\n$$\n$$\ng_{ds}(t) = k (V_{GS0} - V_{TH} - V_{DS0}) + k (\\alpha - 1) v(t)\n$$\nThis equation represents the first-order (and, in this model, exact) dependence of $g_{ds}(t)$ on $v(t)$. The first term, $g_{ds,Q} = k (V_{GS0} - V_{TH} - V_{DS0})$, is the conductance at the DC quiescent bias point (where $v(t)=0$). The second term, $k(\\alpha - 1)v(t)$, describes how the conductance varies linearly with the signal $v(t)$.\n\nThe problem's objective is to \"minimize the first-order nonlinearity of $g_{ds}(t)$ with respect to the signal $v(t)$\". This is synonymous with the stated goal \"to reduce the dependence of the instantaneous small-signal drain-to-source conductance on the signal amplitude\". A perfectly linear resistor would have a constant conductance, independent of the signal voltage across it. Therefore, minimizing the dependence of $g_{ds}(t)$ on $v(t)$ means making $g_{ds}(t)$ as constant as possible. In our derived expression, the entire dependence of $g_{ds}(t)$ on $v(t)$ is captured by the term $k (\\alpha - 1) v(t)$. To eliminate this dependence, the coefficient of $v(t)$ must be set to zero.\n$$\nk (\\alpha - 1) = 0\n$$\nSince $k = \\mu_n C_{ox} (W/L)$ represents the physical parameters of a functioning transistor, it is a non-zero constant ($k > 0$). Thus, for the equation to hold, the other factor must be zero:\n$$\n\\alpha - 1 = 0\n$$\nSolving for $\\alpha$ gives the unique value that makes the instantaneous conductance independent of the signal:\n$$\n\\alpha = 1\n$$\nWith this value of $\\alpha$, the instantaneous conductance becomes constant: $g_{ds}(t) = k (V_{GS0} - V_{TH} - V_{DS0}) = g_{ds,Q}$. This makes the MOSFET behave as an ideal linear resistor for the signal $v(t)$ *in terms of its instantaneous conductance*, as per the strict interpretation of the problem statement.",
