            "solution": "The problem statement has been validated and is found to be self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. It presents a standard exercise in the analysis of a fundamental integrated circuit building block, using first-order metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) models. All provided parameters are physically realistic and mutually consistent. We may therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nThe problem asks for two quantities: the required gate bias voltage for the n-channel MOSFET (NMOS), $V_G$, and the saturation headroom for the p-channel MOSFET (PMOS) active load, $\\Delta V_{\\text{sat}}$.\n\nFirst, we shall determine the NMOS gate bias voltage, $V_G$. The analysis is based on the fundamental definition of the overdrive voltage, $V_{OV}$, for a MOSFET. For an NMOS transistor, the overdrive voltage is defined as the amount by which the gate-source voltage, $V_{GS,n}$, exceeds the threshold voltage, $V_{TN}$.\n$$V_{OV,n} = V_{GS,n} - V_{TN}$$\nFrom the problem description, the source of the NMOS transistor is connected to ground, which means its potential is $V_{S,n} = 0\\,\\text{V}$. The gate-source voltage is therefore equal to the gate voltage itself:\n$$V_{GS,n} = V_G - V_{S,n} = V_G - 0\\,\\text{V} = V_G$$\nSubstituting this into the definition of the overdrive voltage gives:\n$$V_{OV,n} = V_G - V_{TN}$$\nThe problem requires finding the value of $V_G$ that achieves the specified overdrive of $V_{OV,n} = 0.15\\,\\text{V}$. We are also given the NMOS threshold voltage $V_{TN} = 0.35\\,\\text{V}$. We can rearrange the equation to solve for $V_G$:\n$$V_G = V_{OV,n} + V_{TN}$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$V_G = 0.15\\,\\text{V} + 0.35\\,\\text{V} = 0.50\\,\\text{V}$$\nThe drain current $I_D = 100 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{A}$ is a design target that is realized by this choice of overdrive voltage, assuming an appropriate aspect ratio $(W/L)_n$ for the NMOS device. The calculation of $V_G$ from $V_{OV,n}$ and $V_{TN}$ is definitional and does not require knowledge of $I_D$ or the transistor's transconductance parameter.\n\nSecond, we shall compute the saturation headroom for the PMOS active load, $\\Delta V_{\\text{sat}}$, at the specified DC output voltage $V_O = 0.80\\,\\text{V}$. The problem defines the saturation headroom as:\n$$\\Delta V_{\\text{sat}} = V_{SD} - \\left(V_{SG} - \\lvert V_{TP} \\rvert\\right)$$\nThis quantity represents the margin by which the PMOS transistor is operating in the saturation region. For a PMOS device to be saturated, its source-to-drain voltage $V_{SD}$ must be greater than or equal to its overdrive voltage magnitude, $|V_{OV,p}| = V_{SG} - |V_{TP}|$. Thus, a positive $\\Delta V_{\\text{sat}}$ indicates operation in saturation.\n\nWe must first determine the terminal voltages for the PMOS device.\nThe PMOS source is connected to the supply voltage:\n$$V_{S,p} = V_{DD} = 1.2\\,\\text{V}$$\nThe PMOS gate is held at a fixed bias:\n$$V_{G,p} = V_{Gp} = 0.60\\,\\text{V}$$\nThe PMOS drain is connected to the output node, which is at the target voltage:\n$$V_{D,p} = V_O = 0.80\\,\\text{V}$$\nFrom these terminal voltages, we can calculate the source-to-drain voltage, $V_{SD}$, and the source-to-gate voltage, $V_{SG}$:\n$$V_{SD} = V_{S,p} - V_{D,p} = 1.2\\,\\text{V} - 0.80\\,\\text{V} = 0.40\\,\\text{V}$$\n$$V_{SG} = V_{S,p} - V_{G,p} = 1.2\\,\\text{V} - 0.60\\,\\text{V} = 0.60\\,\\text{V}$$\nThe magnitude of the PMOS threshold voltage is given as $|V_{TP}| = 0.35\\,\\text{V}$.\nNow we substitute these values into the formula for the saturation headroom:\n$$\\Delta V_{\\text{sat}} = 0.40\\,\\text{V} - (0.60\\,\\text{V} - 0.35\\,\\text{V})$$\nFirst, calculate the term in the parentheses, which is the PMOS overdrive voltage magnitude:\n$$V_{SG} - |V_{TP}| = 0.60\\,\\text{V} - 0.35\\,\\text{V} = 0.25\\,\\text{V}$$\nThen, complete the calculation for $\\Delta V_{\\text{sat}}$:\n$$\\Delta V_{\\text{sat}} = 0.40\\,\\text{V} - 0.25\\,\\text{V} = 0.15\\,\\text{V}$$\nThe problem requires the answers to be rounded to four significant figures.\nThus, $V_G = 0.5000\\,\\text{V}$ and $\\Delta V_{\\text{sat}} = 0.1500\\,\\text{V}$.",

It is scientifically grounded in established MOSFET theory, well-posed with all necessary parameters provided, and objectively stated.

The transconductance, $g_m$, can be calculated using several equivalent formulas. Given the drain current $I_D$, the process transconductance parameter $k_n'$, and the device geometry $(W/L)$, the most direct formula is:\n$$g_{m1} = \\sqrt{2 k_n' \\left(\\frac{W_1}{L_1}\\right) I_D}$$\nThe given parameters for $M_1$ are:\n- Drain current: $I_D = 100\\,\\mu\\mathrm{A} = 1 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{A}$\n- Process transconductance parameter: $k_n' = 350\\,\\mu\\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{V}^2 = 3.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{A}/\\mathrm{V}^2$\n- Device geometry: $W_1 = 20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, $L_1 = 0.18\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, so the aspect ratio is $\\frac{W_1}{L_1} = \\frac{20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{0.18\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{20}{0.18}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation for $g_{m1}$:\n$$g_{m1} = \\sqrt{2 \\left(3.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{A}}{\\mathrm{V}^2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{20}{0.18}\\right) \\left(1 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{A}\\right)}$$\n$$g_{m1} = \\sqrt{2 \\times 3.5 \\times \\frac{20}{0.18} \\times 10^{-8}}\\,\\mathrm{S} = \\sqrt{\\frac{140}{0.18} \\times 10^{-8}}\\,\\mathrm{S} \\approx \\sqrt{777.77... \\times 10^{-8}}\\,\\mathrm{S}$$\n$$g_{m1} \\approx 2.788866 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{S}$$\nThe problem requests the value in millisiemens ($\\mathrm{mS}$) rounded to four significant figures.\n$$g_m \\approx 2.789\\,\\mathrm{mS}$$\n\n2.  **Calculation of the Small-Signal Output Resistance $r_o$**\n\nThe total output resistance $r_o$ is the parallel combination of the output resistance of the NMOS driver transistor $M_1$ ($r_{o1}$) and the PMOS active load transistor $M_2$ ($r_{o2}$):\n$$r_o = r_{o1} \\parallel r_{o2} = \\frac{r_{o1} r_{o2}}{r_{o1} + r_{o2}}$$\nThe output resistance of a MOSFET in saturation is given by the formula $r_o = \\frac{V_A}{I_D}$, where $V_A$ is the Early voltage.

Note that the actual voltage gain is $A_v = -g_m r_o$ due to the inverting nature of the common-source stage, but the question asks for the magnitude, which is a common convention for intrinsic gain.\nUsing the unrounded values for better accuracy before the final rounding:\n$$A_v = g_{m1} r_o = (2.788866 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{S}) \\times (24324.324\\,\\Omega)$$\n$$A_v \\approx 67.8422$$\nThis is a dimensionless quantity (V/V). Rounding to four significant figures:\n$$A_v \\approx 67.84$$\n\nThe problem also asks to conclude whether the target intrinsic gain of at least $60$ is met. Since our calculated gain is $67.84$, which is greater than $60$, the target is met.\n\nThe final numerical answers requested are $g_m$ in $\\mathrm{mS}$, $r_o$ in $\\mathrm{k}\\Omega$, and $A_v$ as a dimensionless ratio, all rounded to four significant figures.\n- $g_m = 2.789$\n- $r_o = 24.32$\n- $A_v = 67.84$",

There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. There are no inconsistencies, missing data, or logical flaws. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Derivation\nThe objective is to find the maximum peak-to-peak symmetric output voltage swing, denoted $V_{pp,symm}$, for which both the n-channel driver transistor $M_{N}$ and the p-channel load transistor $M_{P}$ remain in the saturation region of operation.\n\nThe analysis begins by establishing the conditions for saturation for each transistor based on the long-channel model.\n\nFor the n-channel MOSFET, $M_{N}$, to be in saturation, its drain-to-source voltage, $V_{DS,N}$, must be greater than or equal to its gate-to-source voltage minus the threshold voltage. This difference is defined as the overdrive voltage $V_{OVN}$.\n$$V_{DS,N} \\geq V_{GS,N} - V_{TN}$$\nUsing the provided definition, this condition is:\n$$V_{DS,N} \\geq V_{OVN}$$\nIn the given circuit configuration, the source of $M_{N}$ is connected to ground ($V_{S,N} = 0$), and its drain is connected to the output node, $v_{o}$. Therefore, the instantaneous drain-to-source voltage is $V_{DS,N} = v_{o} - V_{S,N} = v_{o}$. The condition for $M_{N}$ to remain in saturation sets the lower limit on the output voltage:\n$$v_{o} \\geq V_{OVN}$$\nThis defines the minimum permissible output voltage, $v_{o,min}$:\n$$v_{o,min} = V_{OVN}$$\n\nFor the p-channel MOSFET, $M_{P}$, to be in saturation, its source-to-drain voltage, $V_{SD,P}$, must be greater than or equal to its source-to-gate voltage minus the magnitude of its threshold voltage. This difference is defined as the overdrive voltage $V_{OVP}$.\n$$V_{SD,P} \\geq V_{SG,P} - |V_{TP}|$$\nUsing the provided definition, this condition is:\n$$V_{SD,P} \\geq V_{OVP}$$\nIn the given circuit configuration, the source of $M_{P}$ is connected to the positive supply voltage $V_{DD}$ ($V_{S,P} = V_{DD}$), and its drain is connected to the output node, $v_{o}$. Therefore, the instantaneous source-to-drain voltage is $V_{SD,P} = V_{S,P} - v_{o} = V_{DD} - v_{o}$. The condition for $M_{P}$ to remain in saturation sets the upper limit on the output voltage:\n$$V_{DD} - v_{o} \\geq V_{OVP}$$\nRearranging this inequality to solve for $v_{o}$:\n$$v_{o} \\leq V_{DD} - V_{OVP}$$\nThis defines the maximum permissible output voltage, $v_{o,max}$:\n$$v_{o,max} = V_{DD} - V_{OVP}$$\n\nThe total range of output voltage over which both transistors remain in saturation is the interval $[v_{o,min}, v_{o,max}]$. The total available voltage swing is the difference between these limits:\n$$\\text{Total Swing} = v_{o,max} - v_{o,min} = (V_{DD} - V_{OVP}) - V_{OVN}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the maximum *symmetric* peak-to-peak swing. A symmetric swing implies that the output voltage $v_{o}(t)$ varies equally above and below a quiescent point $V_{OQ}$. To maximize this symmetric swing, $V_{OQ}$ must be chosen to be the midpoint of the valid voltage range:\n$$V_{OQ} = \\frac{v_{o,max} + v_{o,min}}{2} = \\frac{(V_{DD} - V_{OVP}) + V_{OVN}}{2}$$\nWith this optimal choice of $V_{OQ}$, the output can swing from $v_{o,min}$ to $v_{o,max}$. The maximum peak-to-peak symmetric swing, $V_{pp,symm}$, is therefore equal to the total available swing.\n$$V_{pp,symm} = v_{o,max} - v_{o,min}$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for $v_{o,max}$ and $v_{o,min}$:\n$$V_{pp,symm} = (V_{DD} - V_{OVP}) - V_{OVN}$$\n$$V_{pp,symm} = V_{DD} - V_{OVN} - V_{OVP}$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the maximum peak-to-peak symmetric output swing in terms of the given parameters. This swing ensures that for all time $t$, the output voltage $v_{o}(t)$ satisfies $V_{OVN} \\leq v_{o}(t) \\leq V_{DD} - V_{OVP}$, guaranteeing that both $M_{N}$ and $M_{P}$ remain in saturation.",
