The Open-Circuit Time Constant (OCTC) method offers a powerful shortcut for this task, allowing designers to approximate the dominant pole's location by inspecting the resistance seen by each capacitor individually.

            "problem": "A linear time-invariant two-node small-signal amplifier is modeled for high-frequency analysis in the following way. The input node is referenced to ground through a resistance $R_{in}$, and the output node is referenced to ground through a resistance $R_{out}$. A controlled current source from the output node to ground delivers current $i_{d} = g_{mv}\\,v_{in}$, where $v_{in}$ is the small-signal voltage at the input node and $g_{mv}$ is a constant transconductance-like parameter. There is no reverse dependence of the input node on the output node. Parasitic shunt capacitances to ground are present at each node: $C_{in}$ at the input node and $C_{out}$ at the output node. Assume all independent sources are set to zero for small-signal analysis and that no other energy storage elements are present. \n\nUsing the Open-Circuit Time Constant (OCTC) construction, proceed as follows:\n- For each capacitor, with all other capacitors opened, compute the effective resistance $R_{\\text{eff}}$ seen by that capacitor using a test-source definition of small-signal driving-point resistance.\n- Under the assumption that a single pole dominates the high-frequency roll-off, use the OCTC framework to obtain a symbolic expression for the dominant pole location $p_{1}$ (with sign) in radians per second.\n\nExpress the final answer as a single closed-form analytic expression in terms of $R_{in}$, $R_{out}$, $C_{in}$, and $C_{out}$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the dominant pole location, $p_{1}$, for a given two-node small-signal amplifier model. The specified method is the Open-Circuit Time Constant (OCTC) technique.\n\nFirst, we must validate the problem statement.\nThe givens are:\n- A linear time-invariant two-node small-signal amplifier.\n- An input node connected to ground via a resistance $R_{in}$ and a shunt capacitance $C_{in}$. The voltage at this node is $v_{in}$.\n- An output node connected to ground via a resistance $R_{out}$ and a shunt capacitance $C_{out}$.\n- A controlled current source from the output node to ground, with current $i_{d} = g_{mv}\\,v_{in}$, where $g_{mv}$ is a constant transconductance.\n- The model is unilateral: there is no reverse dependence of the input node on the output node.\n- All independent sources are set to zero.\n- The task is to find the dominant pole $p_1$ using the OCTC method, assuming a single pole dominates.\n- The final expression should be in terms of $R_{in}$, $R_{out}$, $C_{in}$, and $C_{out}$.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, describing a standard simplified model of an amplifier. It is well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to apply the specified analysis method (OCTC). The exclusion of $g_{mv}$ from the final answer list is not a contradiction but a consequence of the OCTC method applied to this specific circuit topology, as will be shown. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe OCTC method approximates the frequency of the dominant pole, $\\omega_{H}$, as the reciprocal of the sum of the first-order time constants of the circuit. The pole location $p_{1}$ is then given by $p_{1} = -\\omega_{H}$. The formula is:\n$$p_{1} \\approx -\\frac{1}{\\sum_{i} R_{i0} C_{i}}$$\nwhere $C_{i}$ are the capacitors in the circuit and $R_{i0}$ is the effective resistance seen by the $i$-th capacitor with all other capacitors open-circuited and all independent sources set to zero.\n\nThe circuit contains two capacitors, $C_{in}$ and $C_{out}$. We will compute the effective resistance seen by each.\n\nStep 1: Compute the effective resistance seen by $C_{in}$.\nLet this resistance be $R_{in,\\text{eff}}$. To find it, we open-circuit the other capacitor, $C_{out}$, and set all independent sources to zero (which is already a condition of the problem). We then find the driving-point resistance across the terminals of $C_{in}$.\nThe input node, with voltage $v_{in}$, is connected to ground through the resistor $R_{in}$. The circuit elements at the output node ($R_{out}$, $C_{out}$, and the controlled source) do not affect the input impedance because the problem states there is \"no reverse dependence of the input node on the output node\". Therefore, looking into the terminals where $C_{in}$ is connected, the only path to ground is through the resistor $R_{in}$.\n$$R_{in,\\text{eff}} = R_{in}$$\nThe corresponding open-circuit time constant is:\n$$\\tau_{in} = R_{in,\\text{eff}} \\cdot C_{in} = R_{in} C_{in}$$\n\nStep 2: Compute the effective resistance seen by $C_{out}$.\nLet this resistance be $R_{out,\\text{eff}}$. To find it, we open-circuit the other capacitor, $C_{in}$, and set all independent sources to zero. We find the driving-point resistance across the terminals of $C_{out}$. To do this, we can apply a test voltage source $v_{x}$ across the terminals of $C_{out}$ and compute the current $i_{x}$ that it delivers. The resistance is then $R_{out,\\text{eff}} = v_{x} / i_{x}$.\nThe output node is connected to ground through the resistor $R_{out}$ and the controlled current source $i_{d} = g_{mv} v_{in}$. Applying Kirchhoff's Current Law at the output node, the current from the test source is:\n$$i_{x} = \\frac{v_{x}}{R_{out}} + i_{d} = \\frac{v_{x}}{R_{out}} + g_{mv} v_{in}$$\nNow we must determine the value of the controlling voltage, $v_{in}$. At the input node, the capacitor $C_{in}$ is open-circuited. The node is connected to ground only via $R_{in}$. Since all independent sources in the circuit are set to zero, there is no source to generate a non-zero voltage at the input node. Consequently, the voltage at the input node must be zero.\n$$v_{in} = 0$$\nSubstituting $v_{in}=0$ into the expression for the controlled current source $i_{d}$:\n$$i_{d} = g_{mv} \\cdot 0 = 0$$\nThe controlled source provides zero current and thus behaves as an open circuit. The expression for the test current $i_{x}$ simplifies to:\n$$i_{x} = \\frac{v_{x}}{R_{out}}$$\nThe effective resistance seen by $C_{out}$ is therefore:\n$$R_{out,\\text{eff}} = \\frac{v_{x}}{i_{x}} = \\frac{v_{x}}{v_{x} / R_{out}} = R_{out}$$\nThe corresponding open-circuit time constant is:\n$$\\tau_{out} = R_{out,\\text{eff}} \\cdot C_{out} = R_{out} C_{out}$$\n\nStep 3: Calculate the dominant pole location.\nThe sum of the open-circuit time constants is:\n$$\\sum_{i} \\tau_{i} = \\tau_{in} + \\tau_{out} = R_{in} C_{in} + R_{out} C_{out}$$\nUnder the assumption that a single pole dominates, its location $p_{1}$ is given by the OCTC approximation:\n$$p_{1} = -\\frac{1}{\\sum_{i} \\tau_{i}} = -\\frac{1}{R_{in} C_{in} + R_{out} C_{out}}$$\nThis expression is in terms of the required variables $R_{in}$, $R_{out}$, $C_{in}$, and $C_{out}$. The parameter $g_{mv}$ does not appear in the final result, as it has no effect on the calculation of the open-circuit resistances in this specific circuit configuration. The units of the expression are $1/(\\text{resistance} \\times \\text{capacitance}) = 1/\\text{seconds}$, which corresponds to radians per second, as required.",

            "introduction": "While poles typically dominate the discussion of frequency limitations, zeros play an equally critical role in shaping a circuit's response. This exercise shifts focus to a particularly problematic feature: the Right-Half-Plane (RHP) zero, which introduces signal inversion at high frequencies and can severely degrade stability. By deriving the conditions for its existence and its precise location from fundamental circuit laws, you will uncover how parasitic feedforward paths create non-minimum phase behavior in common amplifier stages .",

            "problem": "Consider an inverting single-transistor stage implemented with an N-channel Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET). The transistor is biased such that its small-signal transconductance is $g_m$. The source node is connected to ground through a resistor $R_s$ (source degeneration), and the drain node is the high-impedance output $v_o(t)$, loaded only by a parasitic capacitance $C_L$ to ground. The gate is driven by an ideal voltage source $v_i(t)$ of zero output impedance, and gate leakage is negligible. The only intrinsic capacitance that couples the input and output is the gate-to-drain capacitance $C_{gd}$; the gate-to-source capacitance may be neglected for this analysis. Channel-length modulation may be neglected so that the output resistance is effectively infinite.\n\nStarting from fundamental definitions and laws for small-signal models:\n- The small-signal transconductance produces a drain current $i_{d}(t)=g_{m} v_{gs}(t)$, where $v_{gs}(t)$ is the gate-to-source voltage.\n- The capacitor current is $i_{C}(t)=C \\frac{d}{dt} v(t)$.\n\n1.

From this transfer function, determine the condition under which the feedforward path through $C_{gd}$ introduces a right-half-plane (RHP) zero in the input-to-output transfer function.\n\n2. Under the same assumptions, derive the zero angular frequency $\\omega_{z}$ as an explicit function of $R_{s}$, $g_{m}$, and $C_{gd}$.\n\nExpress your final answer for the zero angular frequency as a closed-form analytic expression in radians per second. No numerical evaluation is required and no rounding is permitted.",
            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in established circuit theory, self-contained, and objectively phrased. We can proceed with a formal derivation.\n\nThe first step is to construct the small-signal equivalent circuit in the Laplace domain (s-domain). The input voltage is $V_i(s)$ and the output voltage is $V_o(s)$. The voltage at the source node is $V_s(s)$. The circuit consists of the following elements:\n- An ideal voltage source $V_i(s)$ connected to the gate.\n- A capacitor $C_{gd}$ connected between the gate and drain nodes.\n- A capacitor $C_{L}$ connected between the drain node and ground.\n- A voltage-controlled current source with current $g_m V_{gs}(s)$ flowing from the drain to the source node.\n- A resistor $R_s$ connected between the source node and ground.\n\nThe gate-to-source voltage is given by the difference between the gate and source node voltages:\n$$V_{gs}(s) = V_g(s) - V_s(s)$$\nSince the gate is driven by an ideal voltage source, $V_g(s) = V_i(s)$. Therefore:\n$$V_{gs}(s) = V_i(s) - V_s(s)$$\n\nTo find the transfer function $H(s) = \\frac{V_o(s)}{V_i(s)}$, we apply Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) at the source and drain nodes.\n\nKCL at the source node ($V_s$):\nThe current flowing out of the source node through resistor $R_s$ must be equal to the current entering the source node from the controlled current source.\n$$ \\frac{V_s(s)}{R_s} = g_m V_{gs}(s) $$\nSubstituting $V_{gs}(s) = V_i(s) - V_s(s)$:\n$$ \\frac{V_s(s)}{R_s} = g_m (V_i(s) - V_s(s)) $$\nWe can now solve for $V_s(s)$ in terms of $V_i(s)$:\n$$ V_s(s) \\left( \\frac{1}{R_s} + g_m \\right) = g_m V_i(s) \\\\ V_s(s) \\left( \\frac{1 + g_m R_s}{R_s} \\right) = g_m V_i(s) \\\\ V_s(s) = \\frac{g_m R_s}{1 + g_m R_s} V_i(s) $$\nNext, we express $V_{gs}(s)$ solely in terms of $V_i(s)$:\n$$ V_{gs}(s) = V_i(s) - V_s(s) = V_i(s) - \\frac{g_m R_s}{1 + g_m R_s} V_i(s) \\\\ V_{gs}(s) = \\left( 1 - \\frac{g_m R_s}{1 + g_m R_s} \\right) V_i(s) = \\left( \\frac{1 + g_m R_s - g_m R_s}{1 + g_m R_s} \\right) V_i(s) \\\\ V_{gs}(s) = \\frac{1}{1 + g_m R_s} V_i(s) $$\nThis expression represents the well-known effect of source degeneration, which reduces the effective transconductance of the input voltage.\n\nKCL at the drain node ($V_o$):\nThe sum of currents leaving the drain node is zero. These currents are:\n1. Current through the load capacitor $C_L$: $I_{C_L} = s C_L V_o(s)$\n2. Current through the gate-to-drain capacitor $C_{gd}$: $I_{C_{gd}} = s C_{gd} (V_o(s) - V_i(s))$\n3. Current from the controlled current source (flowing into the drain): $I_d = g_m V_{gs}(s)$\n\nSumming currents leaving the node:\n$$ s C_L V_o(s) + s C_{gd} (V_o(s) - V_i(s)) + g_m V_{gs}(s) = 0 $$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $V_{gs}(s)$:\n$$ s V_o(s) (C_L + C_{gd}) - s C_{gd} V_i(s) + g_m \\left( \\frac{1}{1 + g_m R_s} \\right) V_i(s) = 0 $$\nTo find the transfer function, we rearrange the equation to group terms with $V_o(s)$ and $V_i(s)$:\n$$ V_o(s) [s(C_L + C_{gd})] = V_i(s) \\left[ s C_{gd} - \\frac{g_m}{1 + g_m R_s} \\right] $$\nThe transfer function $H(s)$ is the ratio $\\frac{V_o(s)}{V_i(s)}$:\n$$ H(s) = \\frac{s C_{gd} - \\frac{g_m}{1 + g_m R_s}}{s(C_L + C_{gd})} $$\n\n**1. Condition for the Right-Half-Plane (RHP) Zero**\n\nThe zeros of the transfer function are the values of $s$ for which the numerator is zero:\n$$ N(s) = s C_{gd} - \\frac{g_m}{1 + g_m R_s} = 0 $$\nSolving for the zero, $s_z$:\n$$ s_z C_{gd} = \\frac{g_m}{1 + g_m R_s} \\\\ s_z = \\frac{g_m}{C_{gd}(1 + g_m R_s)} $$\nA zero is in the right-half-plane (RHP) if its real part is positive. In this problem, the transistor transconductance $g_m$, the degeneration resistance $R_s$, and the gate-to-drain capacitance $C_{gd}$ are all physical quantities and thus have positive values. Consequently, $g_m > 0$, $R_s \\ge 0$, and $C_{gd} > 0$. The denominator term $C_{gd}(1 + g_m R_s)$ is therefore always positive. This makes $s_z$ a positive, real number. A positive, real root lies on the positive real axis in the s-plane, which is part of the RHP.\n\nThe physical condition that introduces this RHP zero lies in the interaction of two parallel signal paths from the input $V_i(s)$ to the output node $V_o(s)$:\n- **The Main Amplifier Path:** The input voltage creates a gate-to-source voltage $V_{gs}(s)$ which generates a drain current. The current injected into the drain node from this path is $-g_m V_{gs}(s) = -\\frac{g_m}{1+g_m R_s} V_i(s)$. This path is inverting.\n- **The Feedforward Path:** The input voltage couples directly to the output node through the capacitor $C_{gd}$. The current injected into the drain node from this path is $s C_{gd} (V_i(s) - V_o(s))$. A zero occurs when $V_o(s) = 0$, so at the zero frequency $s_z$, this feedforward current is simply $s_z C_{gd} V_i(s)$. This path is non-inverting.\n\nThe RHP zero occurs at the frequency where these two currents perfectly cancel each other out at the output node, resulting in zero output voltage. The condition for its existence is the presence of these two paths with opposing signs. The inverting nature of the common-source amplifier path and the non-inverting nature of the capacitive feedforward path are the fundamental reason for the subtraction in the numerator of the transfer function ($s C_{gd} - \\text{constant}$), which mathematically guarantees a positive (RHP) real zero as long as $g_m > 0$ and $C_{gd} > 0$.\n\n**2. Zero Angular Frequency $\\omega_z$**\n\nThe zero is located at $s_z = \\frac{g_m}{C_{gd}(1 + g_m R_s)}$. For a zero on the real axis of the s-plane, the angular frequency $\\omega_z$ is equal to the value of its location.\nTherefore, the zero angular frequency is:\n$$ \\omega_z = \\frac{g_m}{C_{gd}(1 + g_m R_s)} $$\nThis expression is a function of the given parameters $R_s$, $g_m$, and $C_{gd}$.",
