The rows are the PIs and the columns are the minterms in the on-set $\\mathcal{M}$. An 'X' marks that a PI covers a minterm.\n\n| PI      | Cost | 3 | 7 | 11 | 15 | 19 | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23 | 27 | 28 | 29 | 30 | 31 |\n|---------|:----:|:-:|:-:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|\n| $AC$    | 2    |   |   |    |    |    | X  | X  | X  | X  |    | X  | X  | X  | X  |\n| $DE$    | 2    | X | X | X  | X  | X  |    |    |    | X  | X  |    |    |    | X  |\n\nAn essential prime implicant (EPI) is a PI that provides the only cover for at least one minterm. We identify EPIs by finding columns with only one 'X'.\n-   Minterm $3$ is only covered by $DE$. Thus, $DE$ is an EPI.\n-   Minterm $20$ is only covered by $AC$. Thus, $AC$ is an EPI.\n\nSince both $AC$ and $DE$ are essential, they must be included in the minimal cover. The set of EPIs is $\\{AC, DE\\}$. Let's check if this set covers the entire on-set $\\mathcal{M}$.\n\n-   Minterms covered by $AC$: $\\{20,21,22,23,28,29,30,31\\}$\n-   Minterms covered by $DE$: $\\{3,7,11,15,19,23,27,31\\}$\n\nThe union of these two sets is $\\{3,7,11,15,19,20,21,22,23,27,28,29,30,31\\}$, which is exactly the on-set $\\mathcal{M}$. Therefore, the set of EPIs forms a complete and minimal cover.\n\n### Part 3: Minimal Cost Calculation\n\nThe unique minimal SOP expression is $f(A,B,C,D,E) = AC + DE$.\nThe cost is the total literal count:\n-   The term $AC$ contains $2$ literals.\n-   The term $DE$ contains $2$ literals.\n\nThe minimal literal count is $L_{\\min}(f) = 2 + 2 = 4$.",

An implicant must not cover any minterms in the off-set $\\mathcal{Z}$.\n\nA **prime implicant (PI)** is an implicant that cannot be expanded (by removing a literal) without covering a minterm in the off-set.

Identification of Prime Implicants\n\nWe search for the largest possible rectangular groups of $1$s and Xs, where the group size is a power of $2$.\n\n-   **Group 1**: A block of $8$ minterms is visible in the $a=1$ map, covering the top two rows. This group corresponds to minterms $\\{16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23\\}$. For this group, $a=1$ and $b=0$. The variables $c, d, e$ change within the block and are thus eliminated. The resulting product term is $a\\bar{b}$. This is a prime implicant because it cannot be expanded further. Let's call this $P_1 = a\\bar{b}$.\n\n-   **Group 2**: A second group of $8$ can be formed by looking for adjacencies across both maps. The cells where $c=1$ and $d=1$ are covered by $1$s or Xs. These $8$ minterms are $\\{6, 7, 14, 15, 22, 23, 30, 31\\}$. In this group, $c=1$ and $d=1$, while $a, b, e$ change. The resulting product term is $cd$. This is a prime implicant because expanding it would require including minterms from the off-set. Let's call this $P_2 = cd$.\n\nFurther search reveals no other prime implicants. Any smaller group of $1$s and Xs is fully contained within either $P_1$ or $P_2$.\n\nThe set of all prime implicants for $F$ is $\\{a\\bar{b}, cd\\}$.\n\n### 4. Prime Implicant Chart and Solution Derivation\n\nWe construct a prime implicant chart to select the PIs needed to cover the on-set $\\mathcal{O}=\\{6, 7, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 30\\}$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n & m_6 & m_7 & m_{14} & m_{16} & m_{18} & m_{20} & m_{22} & m_{30} \\\\\n\\hline\nP_1=a\\bar{b} & & & & \\mathbf{X} & \\mathbf{X} & \\mathbf{X} & \\text{X} & \\\\\n\\hline\nP_2=cd & \\mathbf{X} & \\mathbf{X} & \\mathbf{X} & & & & \\text{X} & \\mathbf{X} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n-   Minterm $m_{16}$ is covered only by $P_1$. Therefore, $P_1 = a\\bar{b}$ is an essential prime implicant.\n-   Minterm $m_6$ is covered only by $P_2$. Therefore, $P_2 = cd$ is an essential prime implicant.\n\nSince both prime implicants $P_1$ and $P_2$ are essential, they must both be part of any minimal solution. Their sum covers the entire on-set:\n-   $P_1$ covers on-set minterms $\\{16, 18, 20, 22\\}$.\n-   $P_2$ covers on-set minterms $\\{6, 7, 14, 22, 30\\}$.\n-   The union of these two sets is $\\{6, 7, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 30\\}$, which is precisely the on-set $\\mathcal{O}$.\n\n### 5. Final Minimal Expression\n\nSince the two essential prime implicants provide a full cover for the on-set, the minimal SOP expression is their sum. The cost is 2 product terms and 4 literals, which is minimal.\n\nThe minimal SOP expression is $F(a,b,c,d,e) = a\\bar{b} + cd$.",

The process involves identifying all useful prime implicants (PIs) for the individual functions and for products of functions, then selecting a minimal-cost set of these PIs.\n\n### Step 1: Identify Prime Implicants\n\nWe first find the prime implicants for each function individually, typically using Karnaugh maps. All specified minterms are in the range $8-15$, so they all have $A=1$.\n\n*   **For $f_1 = \\sum m(10, 11, 14, 15)$:** The four minterms form a single group on the K-map, yielding one prime implicant: $p_1 = AC$.\n*   **For $f_2 = \\sum m(10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15)$:** This function can be covered by two prime implicants: $p_1 = AC$ (covering $\\{10,11,14,15\\}$) and $p_2 = AB$ (covering $\\{12,13,14,15\\}$).\n*   **For $f_3 = \\sum m(9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15)$:** This function has two prime implicants: $p_1 = AC$ (covering $\\{10,11,14,15\\}$) and $p_3 = AD$ (covering $\\{9,11,13,15\\}$).\n\nThe set of candidate product terms for our shared library consists of all prime implicants of the individual functions: $\\{AC, AB, AD\\}$.\n\n### Step 2: Select a Minimal Cost Cover (System-level Essentials)\n\nWe now determine which product terms must be included in our implementation. A product term is essential to the system if it's the only one that can cover a specific minterm for one of the output functions.\n\n*   For function $f_2$, minterm $m_{12}$ is covered only by the prime implicant $AB$. Therefore, $AB$ is an **essential product term** for the system and must be included in our library and connected to output $f_2$.\n*   For function $f_3$, minterm $m_9$ is covered only by the prime implicant $AD$. Therefore, $AD$ is also an **essential product term** for the system and must be included in our library and connected to output $f_3$.\n\nWith these essential terms selected, let's assess what is covered and what remains:\n*   **Library so far**: $\\{AB, AD\\}$.\n*   **Functions implemented so far**:\n    *   $f_1 = 0$\n    *   $f_2 = AB$ (covers $\\{12,13,14,15\\}$)\n    *   $f_3 = AD$ (covers $\\{9,11,13,15\\}$)\n*   **Remaining minterms to cover**:\n    *   For $f_1$: $\\{10, 11, 14, 15\\}$\n    *   For $f_2$: $\\{10, 11\\}$\n    *   For $f_3$: $\\{10, 14\\}$\n\nAll remaining minterms for all three functions ($\\{10, 11, 14, 15\\}$) can be covered by the single product term $AC$. Since this term is a prime implicant for all three functions, it is the most efficient choice to add to our library and share.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Total Cost\n\nThe final implementation uses the following:\n*   **Shared Product Term Library**: $\\{AC, AB, AD\\}$\n*   **Output Functions**:\n    *   $f_1 = AC$\n    *   $f_2 = AB + AC$\n    *   $f_3 = AD + AC$\n\nNow, we calculate the total cost $J = J_{\\mathrm{AND}} + J_{\\mathrm{OR}}$.\n*   **AND-plane cost ($J_{\\mathrm{AND}}$)**: This is the sum of literals for all unique product terms in the library.\n    *   Literals in $AC$: 2\n    *   Literals in $AB$: 2\n    *   Literals in $AD$: 2\n    *   $J_{\\mathrm{AND}} = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6$.\n*   **OR-plane cost ($J_{\\mathrm{OR}}$)**: This is the total number of connections from the product terms to the output OR gates.\n    *   Connections for $f_1$: 1 (from $AC$)\n    *   Connections for $f_2$: 2 (from $AB$ and $AC$)\n    *   Connections for $f_3$: 2 (from $AD$ and $AC$)\n    *   $J_{\\mathrm{OR}} = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n\nThe total minimum cost is $J = J_{\\mathrm{AND}} + J_{\\mathrm{OR}} = 6 + 5 = 11$.",
