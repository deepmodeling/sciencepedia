            "problem": "Consider the task of synthesizing a $2$-level Sum-of-Products (SOP) realization for an incompletely specified Boolean function $F(a,b,c,d,e)$ arising in Integrated Circuit design automation, also known as Electronic Design Automation (EDA). The function $F$ maps $\\{0,1\\}^5$ to $\\{0,1\\}$ and is specified by its on-set $\\mathcal{O}$ and don't-care set $\\mathcal{D}$, with the off-set $\\mathcal{Z}$ defined as the complement of $\\mathcal{O} \\cup \\mathcal{D}$ in $\\{0,1\\}^5$. Let the minterm indexing be $m = 16a + 8b + 4c + 2d + e$ with $a$ as the most significant bit.\n\nThe on-set and don't-care set are given by\n$$\n\\mathcal{O} = \\{6,7,14,16,18,20,22,30\\}, \\quad \\mathcal{D} = \\{15,17,19,21,23,31\\}.\n$$\nThe off-set is $\\mathcal{Z} = \\{0,1,\\dots,31\\} \\setminus (\\mathcal{O} \\cup \\mathcal{D})$.\n\nStarting from the fundamental definitions of implicants and prime implicants in Boolean algebra, and using the principle that a product term may be expanded to include don't-care minterms without violating correctness on $\\mathcal{O}$ and $\\mathcal{Z}$, derive a minimum-cost $2$-level SOP expression for $F$ that covers all minterms in $\\mathcal{O}$ and none in $\\mathcal{Z}$. Use the following cost metric: primary objective is to minimize the number of product terms; in case of ties, minimize the total literal count.\n\nExpress the final SOP using $+$ for logical OR, juxtaposition for logical AND, and an overbar to denote logical negation of a literal. The final answer must be a single closed-form Boolean expression.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a minimum-cost $2$-level Sum-of-Products (SOP) expression for a $5$-variable incompletely specified Boolean function $F(a,b,c,d,e)$. The function is defined by its on-set $\\mathcal{O}$ and don't-care set $\\mathcal{D}$.\n\n**1. Problem Validation**\n\nThe givens are:\n-   Function variables: $a,b,c,d,e$.\n-   Minterm indexing: $m = 16a + 8b + 4c + 2d + e$.\n-   On-set: $\\mathcal{O} = \\{6, 7, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 30\\}$.\n-   Don't-care set: $\\mathcal{D} = \\{15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 31\\}$.\n-   Cost metric: Primary objective is to minimize the number of product terms. Secondary objective is to minimize the total literal count.\n\nThe problem is a standard, well-defined exercise in digital logic minimization. It is scientifically grounded, free of contradictions, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is valid.\n\n**2. Theoretical Framework**\n\nA product term is an **implicant** of a function $F$ if, for any input combination for which the product term evaluates to $1$, the function $F$ also evaluates to $1$ or is a don't-care. An implicant must not cover any minterms in the off-set $\\mathcal{Z}$.\n\nA **prime implicant (PI)** is an implicant that is not \"subsumed\" by any other single implicant with fewer literals. Maximizing the use of don't-cares allows for the creation of larger implicants (with fewer literals), which is key to finding a minimal SOP expression.\n\nA **minimal SOP expression** is a sum of prime implicants that covers all minterms in the on-set $\\mathcal{O}$ and none in the off-set $\\mathcal{Z}$, while satisfying the given cost metric.\n\nAn **essential prime implicant (EPI)** is a prime implicant that covers at least one on-set minterm not covered by any other prime implicant. All EPIs must be included in any minimal SOP solution.\n\n**3. Karnaugh Map Representation**\n\nTo systematically find all prime implicants, we use a $5$-variable Karnaugh map (K-map). It consists of two $4 \\times 4$ grids, one for $a=0$ (minterms $0-15$) and one for $a=1$ (minterms $16-31$). The rows are indexed by $bc$ and columns by $de$ in Gray code order ($00, 01, 11, 10$).\n\nThe function's on-set $\\mathcal{O}$ minterms are marked with '$1$' and don't-care $\\mathcal{D}$ minterms are marked with 'X'. Unspecified cells are part of the off-set $\\mathcal{Z}$ and are implicitly '$0$'.\n\nThe populated K-maps are:\n\n**Map for $a=0$**\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \\multicolumn{4}{c}{de} \\\\\n\\cline{2-5}\n\\textit{bc} & 00 & 01 & 11 & 10 \\\\\n\\cline{2-5}\n00 & m_0=0 & m_1=0 & m_3=0 & m_2=0 \\\\\n\\cline{2-5}\n01 & m_4=0 & m_5=0 & m_7=1 & m_6=1 \\\\\n\\cline{2-5}\n11 & m_{12}=0 & m_{13}=0 & m_{15}=\\text{X} & m_{14}=1 \\\\\n\\cline{2-5}\n10 & m_8=0 & m_9=0 & m_{11}=0 & m_{10}=0 \\\\\n\\cline{2-5}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n**Map for $a=1$**\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \\multicolumn{4}{c}{de} \\\\\n\\cline{2-5}\n\\textit{bc} & 00 & 01 & 11 & 10 \\\\\n\\cline{2-5}\n00 & m_{16}=1 & m_{17}=\\text{X} & m_{19}=\\text{X} & m_{18}=1 \\\\\n\\cline{2-5}\n01 & m_{20}=1 & m_{21}=\\text{X} & m_{23}=\\text{X} & m_{22}=1 \\\\\n\\cline{2-5}\n11 & m_{28}=0 & m_{29}=0 & m_{31}=\\text{X} & m_{30}=1 \\\\\n\\cline{2-5}\n10 & m_{24}=0 & m_{25}=0 & m_{27}=0 & m_{26}=0 \\\\\n\\cline{2-5}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n**4. Identification of Prime Implicants**\n\nWe search for the largest possible rectangular groups of $1$s and Xs, where the group size is a power of $2$.\n\n-   **Group 1**: A block of $8$ minterms is visible in the $a=1$ map, covering the top two rows. This group corresponds to minterms $\\{16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23\\}$. For this group, $a=1$ and $b=0$. The variables $c, d, e$ change within the block and are thus eliminated. The resulting product term is $a\\bar{b}$. This is a prime implicant because it cannot be expanded further into a group of $16$ (e.g., dropping $a$ would include minterm $m_8=0$, and dropping $\\bar{b}$ would include minterm $m_{28}=0$). Let's call this $P_1 = a\\bar{b}$.\n\n-   **Group 2**: A second group of $8$ can be formed by looking for adjacencies across both maps. The cells where $c=1$ and $d=1$ are covered by $1$s or Xs. These cells correspond to rows $bc \\in \\{01, 11\\}$ and columns $de \\in \\{11, 10\\}$ (due to Gray coding).\n    -   On the $a=0$ map: $\\{m_6, m_7, m_{14}, m_{15}\\}$.\n    -   On the $a=1$ map: $\\{m_{22}, m_{23}, m_{30}, m_{31}\\}$.\n    These $8$ minterms $\\{6, 7, 14, 15, 22, 23, 30, 31\\}$ form a valid implicant. In this group, $c=1$ and $d=1$, while $a, b, e$ change. The resulting product term is $cd$. This is a prime implicant because expanding it by dropping either $c$ or $d$ would require including minterms from the off-set (e.g., dropping $c$ would include $m_4=0$, dropping $d$ would include $m_2=0$). Let's call this $P_2 = cd$.\n\n-   Further search reveals no other prime implicants. Any smaller group of $1$s and Xs is fully contained within either $P_1$ or $P_2$. For instance, the group $\\{6, 7, 14, 15\\}$ gives $\\bar{a}cd$, which is subsumed by $cd$.\n\nThe set of all prime implicants for $F$ is $\\{a\\bar{b}, cd\\}$.\n\n**5. Prime Implicant Chart and Solution Derivation**\n\nWe construct a prime implicant chart to select the PIs needed to cover the on-set $\\mathcal{O}=\\{6, 7, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 30\\}$.\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n & m_6 & m_7 & m_{14} & m_{16} & m_{18} & m_{20} & m_{22} & m_{30} \\\\\n\\hline\nP_1=a\\bar{b} & & & & \\mathbf{X} & \\mathbf{X} & \\mathbf{X} & \\text{X} & \\\\\n\\hline\nP_2=cd & \\mathbf{X} & \\mathbf{X} & \\mathbf{X} & & & & \\text{X} & \\mathbf{X} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n-   Minterm $m_{16}$ is covered only by $P_1$. Therefore, $P_1 = a\\bar{b}$ is an essential prime implicant. The same applies to $m_{18}$ and $m_{20}$.\n-   Minterm $m_6$ is covered only by $P_2$. Therefore, $P_2 = cd$ is an essential prime implicant. The same applies to $m_7$, $m_{14}$, and $m_{30}$.\n\nSince both prime implicants $P_1$ and $P_2$ are essential, they must both be part of any minimal solution. Let's verify if their sum covers the entire on-set:\n-   $P_1$ covers on-set minterms $\\{16, 18, 20, 22\\}$.\n-   $P_2$ covers on-set minterms $\\{6, 7, 14, 22, 30\\}$.\n-   The union of these two sets is $\\{6, 7, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 30\\}$, which is precisely the on-set $\\mathcal{O}$.\n\nSince the two essential prime implicants provide a full cover for the on-set, the minimal SOP expression is their sum.\n\n**6. Final Minimal Expression**\n\nThe minimal SOP expression is $F(a,b,c,d,e) = a\\bar{b} + cd$.\n\nLet's check the cost:\n-   Number of product terms: $2$. This is the minimum possible, as we have two EPIs.\n-   Total literal count: $2 (\\text{from } a\\bar{b}) + 2 (\\text{from } cd) = 4$.\n\nThis solution is unique and minimal according to the specified cost metric.",

Problem Validation**\n\nThe givens are:\n-   Input variables: $A, B, C, D$.\n-   Minterm indexing: $i = 8A + 4B + 2C + D$.\n-   On-sets:\n    -   $f_1: \\{10, 11, 14, 15\\}$\n    -   $f_2: \\{10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15\\}$\n    -   $f_3: \\{9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15\\}$\n-   No don't-cares.\nThe problem is a well-defined, standard multi-output logic minimization task grounded in digital logic theory. It is valid and solvable.\n\n**2. Theoretical Framework & Derivation**\n\nThe core principle of multi-output minimization is to identify product terms that can be shared among multiple functions to reduce the overall implementation cost. We first find the prime implicants (PIs) for each individual function.\n\nUsing 4-variable Karnaugh maps for each function:\n\n-   **For $f_1(A,B,C,D)$**: The on-set $\\{10, 11, 14, 15\\}$ corresponds to minterms $\\{1010, 1011, 1110, 1111\\}$. These four minterms form a single rectangular group on the K-map where $A=1$ and $C=1$. This gives a single prime implicant, $AC$. Thus, the only possible implementation for $f_1$ is $f_1 = AC$.\n\n-   **For $f_2(A,B,C,D)$**: The on-set $\\{10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15\\}$ can be covered by two prime implicants:\n    -   $p_1 = AC$, which covers the on-set minterms $\\{10, 11, 14, 15\\}$.\n    -   $p_2 = AB$, which covers the on-set minterms $\\{12, 13, 14, 15\\}$.\n    To cover the entire on-set for $f_2$, both PIs are required. Minterm $12 (1100)$ is only covered by $AB$, and minterm $10 (1010)$ is only covered by $AC$. Both are essential for $f_2$. So, if minimized alone, $f_2 = AB + AC$.\n\n-   **For $f_3(A,B,C,D)$**: The on-set $\\{9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15\\}$ is covered by two prime implicants:\n    -   $p_1 = AC$, which covers $\\{10, 11, 14, 15\\}$.\n    -   $p_3 = AD$, which covers $\\{9, 11, 13, 15\\}$.\n    Minterm $9 (1001)$ is only covered by $AD$, and minterm $10 (1010)$ is only covered by $AC$. Both are essential for $f_3$. So, if minimized alone, $f_3 = AC + AD$.\n\n**3. Multi-Output Covering and Cost Calculation**\n\nThe set of all candidate product terms for the shared library is the union of all PIs found: $\\{AC, AB, AD\\}$. We now select a minimum-cost subset of these to realize all three functions.\n\n1.  **Selection of Product Terms:**\n    -   To realize $f_1$, we must use the term $AC$.\n    -   To realize $f_2$, we must cover minterm $12$, which requires the term $AB$.\n    -   To realize $f_3$, we must cover minterm $9$, which requires the term $AD$.\n    Therefore, all three product terms, $AC, AB, AD$, are essential for the system as a whole and must be included in our shared product-term library.\n\n2.  **Implementation:**\n    -   Library of product terms: $\\{AC, AB, AD\\}$.\n    -   $f_1$ needs to cover $\\{10,11,14,15\\}$. The term $AC$ does this. So, $f_1 = AC$.\n    -   $f_2$ needs to cover $\\{10,11,12,13,14,15\\}$. We must use $AB$ (for $m_{12}$) and $AC$ (for $m_{10}$). So, $f_2 = AB + AC$.\n    -   $f_3$ needs to cover $\\{9,10,11,13,14,15\\}$. We must use $AD$ (for $m_9$) and $AC$ (for $m_{10}$). So, $f_3 = AD + AC$.\n\n3.  **Cost Calculation:**\n    -   **$J_{\\mathrm{AND}}$ (Literal Cost):** The total number of literals in the unique product terms in our library.\n        -   Cost of $AC$: 2 literals.\n        -   Cost of $AB$: 2 literals.\n        -   Cost of $AD$: 2 literals.\n        -   $J_{\\mathrm{AND}} = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6$.\n    -   **$J_{\\mathrm{OR}}$ (Connection Cost):** The total number of connections from the library to the output OR gates.\n        -   $f_1$ uses 1 term ($AC$). Cost = 1.\n        -   $f_2$ uses 2 terms ($AB, AC$). Cost = 2.\n        -   $f_3$ uses 2 terms ($AD, AC$). Cost = 2.\n        -   $J_{\\mathrm{OR}} = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5$.\n    -   **Total Cost ($J$):**\n        -   $J = J_{\\mathrm{AND}} + J_{\\mathrm{OR}} = 6 + 5 = 11$.\n\nThis solution is minimal because it is built from product terms that are essential to cover specific minterms for individual outputs. The heavy sharing of the term $AC$ across all three functions is key to the optimization.\n\n**4. Final Answer**\n\nThe minimum possible value of the cost $J$ is $11$.",
