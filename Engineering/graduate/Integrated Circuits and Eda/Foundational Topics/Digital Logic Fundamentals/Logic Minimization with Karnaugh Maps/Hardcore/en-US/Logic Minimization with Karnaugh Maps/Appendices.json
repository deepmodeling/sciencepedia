            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. It is a standard problem in digital logic design that can be solved using established principles of Boolean algebra and Karnaugh maps.\n\nThe solution will be developed in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n### Part 1: A Principled Method for Redundant Prime Implicant Detection\n\nA method for identifying redundant prime implicants in the presence of don't-cares, based on first principles, can be formulated as follows:\n\n1.  **Fundamental Definitions**:\n    *   An **implicant** of a Boolean function $F$ is a product term $P$ which implies $F$; that is, whenever $P=1$, $F=1$. For functions with don't-cares ($d$), an implicant of the function $F$ with don't-care set $d$ is a product term $P$ such that for any minterm $m$ covered by $P$, the value of the function at $m$ is either $1$ (on-set) or $X$ (don't-care). The implicant must not cover any minterms where the function's value is $0$ (off-set). Furthermore, an implicant of $F$ must cover at least one minterm from the on-set of $F$.\n    *   A **Prime Implicant (PI)** is an implicant that is no longer a valid implicant if any of its literals are removed. On a Karnaugh map, this corresponds to a rectangular grouping of $1$s and $X$s (of size $2^k$) that is not fully contained within any larger rectangular grouping of $1$s and $X$s.\n    *   An **Essential Prime Implicant (EPI)** is a prime implicant that covers at least one on-set minterm that no other prime implicant covers.\n    *   A **Redundant Prime Implicant** is a prime implicant $P_{red}$ in the context of a chosen cover. If a set of PIs $\\{P_1, ..., P_k\\}$ forms a valid and minimal cover for the function, any PI not in this set is redundant. A more specific definition, useful for the minimization process, is that a PI is redundant with respect to the set of EPIs if all the on-set minterms it covers are also covered by the EPIs.\n\n2.  **Proposed Method**:\n    1.  Construct the Karnaugh map for the given function $F$ with variables $A, B, C$. Populate the map cells with $1$ for on-set minterms, $X$ for don't-care minterms, and $0$ (or leave blank) for off-set minterms.\n    2.  Identify all Prime Implicants (PIs) by finding all maximal rectangular groupings of $1$s and $X$s.\n    3.  Identify all Essential Prime Implicants (EPIs). This is done by inspecting each on-set minterm ($1$). If a minterm is covered by only a single PI, that PI is an EPI.\n    4.  Form an initial sum-of-products expression consisting of all EPIs.\n    5.  Determine the set of on-set minterms covered by the EPIs.\n    6.  If this set constitutes the entire on-set of $F$, then the minimal sum is the sum of the EPIs. Any PI that is not an EPI is, in this case, redundant. Its removal from a potential cover containing all PIs does not affect the function's value on the care set, as its contribution to covering the on-set is already handled by the necessary EPIs.\n    7.  If the EPIs do not cover the entire on-set, the problem reduces to a covering problem for the remaining minterms, which requires selecting a minimal set of non-essential PIs. A non-essential PI is then deemed redundant if it is not selected in the final minimal cover.\n\n### Part 2: Application of the Method to $F(A,B,C)$\n\nThe function is $F(A,B,C)$ with on-set $\\sum m(1,2,3,6,7)$ and don't-care set $d=\\sum m(0,4)$. The off-set is implicitly $\\sum m(5)$.\n\n1.  **Karnaugh Map Construction**: The $3$-variable K-map for $F(A,B,C)$ is constructed. The variable $A$ corresponds to the rows, and the Gray-coded pair $BC$ corresponds to the columns.\n\n    $$\n    \\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}\n    \\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \\multicolumn{4}{c}{BC} \\\\\n    \\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{00} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{01} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{11} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{10} \\\\\n    \\cline{2-5}\n    A=0 & X_{m0} & 1_{m1} & 1_{m3} & 1_{m2} \\\\\n    \\cline{2-5}\n    A=1 & X_{m4} & 0_{m5} & 1_{m7} & 1_{m6} \\\\\n    \\cline{2-5}\n    \\end{array}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Enumeration of all Prime Implicants (PIs)**: We identify all maximal rectangular groupings of $1$s and $X$s.\n    *   A group of four covering the entire top row ($m_0, m_1, m_2, m_3$) corresponds to the term where $A=0$. This is the term $\\overline{A}$. This is a PI as it cannot be expanded. It covers on-set minterms $\\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\n    *   A group of four forming a $2 \\times 2$ square in the center two columns ($m_2, m_3, m_6, m_7$) corresponds to the term where $B=1$. This is the term $B$. This is a PI. It covers on-set minterms $\\{2, 3, 6, 7\\}$.\n    *   A group of four covering the four corners ($m_0, m_2, m_4, m_6$) corresponds to the term where $C=0$. This is the term $\\overline{C}$. This is a PI. It covers on-set minterms $\\{2, 6\\}$.\n    *   Any smaller group (e.g., of two cells) is contained within one of these larger groups. For instance, the implicant $AB$ (covering $m_6, m_7$) is fully contained within the implicant $B$. Thus, $AB$ is not a prime implicant. The same applies to all other possible smaller groupings.\n\n    The complete set of prime implicants is $\\{ \\overline{A}, B, \\overline{C} \\}$.\n\n3.  **Identification of Essential and Redundant Prime Implicants**:\n    *   To find EPIs, we check which on-set minterms are covered by only one PI.\n        *   Minterm $m_1$: Is covered only by the PI $\\overline{A}$. Therefore, **$\\overline{A}$ is an Essential Prime Implicant**.\n        *   Minterm $m_2$: Is covered by $\\overline{A}$, $B$, and $\\overline{C}$.\n        *   Minterm $m_3$: Is covered by $\\overline{A}$ and $B$.\n        *   Minterm $m_6$: Is covered by $B$ and $\\overline{C}$.\n        *   Minterm $m_7$: Is covered only by the PI $B$. Therefore, **$B$ is an Essential Prime Implicant**.\n\n    *   The set of EPIs is $\\{\\overline{A}, B\\}$.\n    *   Next, we check the coverage provided by the EPIs. $\\overline{A}$ covers $\\{m_1, m_2, m_3\\}$ and $B$ covers $\\{m_2, m_3, m_6, m_7\\}$. The union of minterms covered by the EPIs is $\\{1, 2, 3\\} \\cup \\{2, 3, 6, 7\\} = \\{1, 2, 3, 6, 7\\}$.\n    *   This set is identical to the function's on-set. Therefore, the EPIs alone are sufficient to realize the function.\n    *   The only remaining PI is $\\overline{C}$. We check if it is redundant. $\\overline{C}$ covers the on-set minterms $\\{m_2, m_6\\}$. Minterm $m_2$ is covered by the EPIs $\\overline{A}$ and $B$. Minterm $m_6$ is covered by the EPI $B$. Since all on-set minterms covered by $\\overline{C}$ are also covered by the set of EPIs, **$\\overline{C}$ is a redundant prime implicant**. Removing it does not change the function on the care set.\n\n### Part 3: Derivation of the Minimum-Cost Sum-of-Products Realization\n\nThe minimum-cost sum-of-products (SOP) expression must include all essential prime implicants. As established in Part 2, the set of EPIs $\\{\\overline{A}, B\\}$ is not only necessary but also sufficient to cover all on-set minterms of the function $F$.\n\nThe minimal cover is therefore the sum of the essential prime implicants:\n$$F(A,B,C) = \\overline{A} + B$$\nThis expression is derived by taking the PIs from the minimal cover identified, which are $\\{\\overline{A}, B\\}$. No further Boolean algebraic simplification (like absorption) can be applied to $\\overline{A} + B$.\n\nThe cost of this realization is:\n*   Number of product terms: $2$.\n*   Total literal count: $1$ (for $\\overline{A}$) + $1$ (for $B$) = $2$.\n\nSince this solution is constructed from only the essential components, it is guaranteed to be a minimal SOP solution according to the specified cost criteria (first number of terms, then number of literals).",

Use the conventional canonical minterm indexing with $A$ as the most-significant bit and $D$ as the least-significant bit, i.e., the index $m$ corresponding to $(A,B,C,D)$ is given by $m = 8A + 4B + 2C + D$.

            "solution": "The problem requires the development and application of a systematic procedure for detecting and correcting errors in a proposed sum-of-products (SOP) expression for a given Boolean function. The function $F(A,B,C,D)$ is defined by its on-set $S$ and do-not-care set $X$, and an incorrect implementation $\\widehat{F}$ is provided.\n\nFirst, we formalize the foundational principles. A Boolean function of $n$ variables, here $n=4$, is defined over a universe of $2^n=16$ minterms, $U = \\{m_0, m_1, \\ldots, m_{15}\\}$. The function is specified by partitioning $U$ into three disjoint sets:\n1.  The on-set $S$, containing minterms for which the function must evaluate to $1$.\n2.  The do-not-care set $X$, for which the function's output can be either $0$ or $1$.\n3.  The off-set $Z$, for which the function must evaluate to $0$. We have $Z = U \\setminus (S \\cup X)$.\n\nAn SOP expression $G = P_1 + P_2 + \\dots + P_k$, where each $P_i$ is a product term (an implicant), is a valid implementation of the function $F$ if and only if the set of minterms it covers, denoted $M(G)$, satisfies the condition $S \\subseteq M(G) \\subseteq S \\cup X$. This condition ensures two properties:\n-   **Completeness:** All on-set minterms are covered ($S \\subseteq M(G)$).\n-   **Correctness:** No off-set minterms are covered ($M(G) \\cap Z = \\varnothing$).\n\nA systematic procedure for error detection in a proposed expression $\\widehat{F}$ is as follows:\n1.  **Formal Representation:** Identify the on-set $S$, do-not-care set $X$, and off-set $Z$ from the problem specification.\n2.  **Coverage Analysis:** For the proposed expression $\\widehat{F}$, determine the set of minterms it covers, $M(\\widehat{F})$. This is done by finding the set of minterms covered by each product term in $\\widehat{F}$ and taking their union.\n3.  **Error Detection:**\n    a.  **Omission Errors:** These are on-set minterms that are not covered by $\\widehat{F}$. The set of such errors is $E_{\\text{omission}} = S \\setminus M(\\widehat{F})$. If $E_{\\text{omission}}$ is non-empty, $\\widehat{F}$ is incomplete.\n    b.  **Commission Errors:** These are off-set minterms that are incorrectly covered by $\\widehat{F}$. The set of such errors is $E_{\\text{commission}} = M(\\widehat{F}) \\cap Z$. If $E_{\\text{commission}}$ is non-empty, $\\widehat{F}$ is incorrect.\n\nTo correct the errors and find a minimal SOP expression, one must discard the incorrect expression and perform a de novo minimization using a standard method like the Karnaugh map (K-map) technique.\n\nNow, we apply this procedure to the specific problem.\n\n**Step 1: Formal Representation**\nThe givens are:\n-   Variables: $A$ (MSB), $B$, $C$, $D$ (LSB).\n-   On-set: $S = \\{0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13\\}$.\n-   Do-not-care set: $X = \\varnothing$.\n-   The universe of minterms is $U = \\{0, 1, \\dots, 15\\}$.\n-   The off-set is $Z = U \\setminus (S \\cup X) = U \\setminus S = \\{3, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15\\}$.\n-   The faulty expression is $\\widehat{F}(A,B,C,D) = \\overline{C} + \\overline{A}\\,\\overline{B}$.\n\n**Step 2: Coverage Analysis of $\\widehat{F}$**\nWe determine the minterms covered by each term in $\\widehat{F}$. A minterm $m_{8A+4B+2C+D}$ is represented by the binary tuple $(A,B,C,D)$.\n-   The term $P_1 = \\overline{C}$ corresponds to the subcube $(A,B,C,D) = (-, -, 0, -)$, where '$-$' indicates the variable can be $0$ or $1$. This covers all minterms where $C=0$.\n    $M(P_1) = M(\\overline{C}) = \\{0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13\\}$.\n-   The term $P_2 = \\overline{A}\\,\\overline{B}$ corresponds to the subcube $(A,B,C,D) = (0, 0, -, -)$. This covers all minterms where $A=0$ and $B=0$.\n    $M(P_2) = M(\\overline{A}\\,\\overline{B}) = \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$.\n-   The total set of minterms covered by $\\widehat{F}$ is the union:\n    $M(\\widehat{F}) = M(P_1) \\cup M(P_2) = \\{0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13\\} \\cup \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\} = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13\\}$.\n\n**Step 3: Error Detection**\n-   **Omission Errors:** We find the on-set minterms not covered by $\\widehat{F}$.\n    $E_{\\text{omission}} = S \\setminus M(\\widehat{F}) = \\{0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13\\} \\setminus \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13\\} = \\{6\\}$.\n    The minterm $m_6$ is required but is not covered. This is an omission error.\n-   **Commission Errors:** We find the off-set minterms covered by $\\widehat{F}$.\n    $E_{\\text{commission}} = M(\\widehat{F}) \\cap Z = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13\\} \\cap \\{3, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15\\} = \\{3\\}$.\n    The minterm $m_3$ is part of the off-set but is covered by $\\widehat{F}$. This is a commission error. The fault lies with the term $P_2 = \\overline{A}\\,\\overline{B}$, since $m_3 \\in M(P_2)$ but $m_3 \\notin M(P_1)$. Thus, the grouping corresponding to $\\overline{A}\\,\\overline{B}$ is invalid.\n\n**Step 4: Derivation of the Corrected Minimal SOP**\nWe construct a 4-variable K-map for $F(A,B,C,D)$ and populate it with $1$s for the minterms in $S$. All other cells corresponding to $Z$ contain $0$s.\n\nThe K-map is as follows, with rows indexed by $AB$ and columns by $CD$ in Gray code:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\multicolumn{1}{r}{CD} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{00} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{01} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{11} & \\multicolumn{1}{c}{10} \\\\ \\cline{2-5}\nAB=00 & 1_{0} & 1_{1} & 0_{3} & 1_{2} \\\\ \\cline{2-5}\nAB=01 & 1_{4} & 1_{5} & 0_{7} & 1_{6} \\\\ \\cline{2-5}\nAB=11 & 1_{12} & 1_{13} & 0_{15} & 0_{14} \\\\ \\cline{2-5}\nAB=10 & 1_{8} & 1_{9} & 0_{11} & 0_{10} \\\\ \\cline{2-5}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nNext, we identify all prime implicants (PIs) by finding the largest possible rectangular groups of $1$s.\n-   A group of eight $1$s covers minterms $\\{0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13\\}$. The variable that remains constant in this group is $C=0$. This corresponds to the prime implicant $P_1 = \\overline{C}$. This is a prime implicant as it cannot be made larger.\n-   A group of four $1$s covers minterms $\\{0, 2, 4, 6\\}$. The variables that remain constant are $A=0$ and $D=0$. This corresponds to the prime implicant $P_2 = \\overline{A}\\,\\overline{D}$. This is also a prime implicant.\n-   Other potential groupings, such as the one covering $\\{2, 6\\}$ (term $\\overline{A}C\\overline{D}$), are not prime because they are fully contained within a larger implicant (in this case, $P_2$).\n\nThe set of all prime implicants is $\\{ \\overline{C}, \\overline{A}\\,\\overline{D} \\}$.\n\nNow we must select a minimal set of PIs to cover all minterms in $S$.\n-   **Essential Prime Implicants:** An essential prime implicant (EPI) is one that covers an on-set minterm that no other prime implicant can cover.\n  - The minterms $m_1, m_5, m_9, m_{13}$ (among others) are covered only by the prime implicant $\\overline{C}$. Therefore, $\\overline{C}$ is an essential prime implicant.\n  - After selecting $\\overline{C}$, the remaining uncovered on-set minterms are $\\{2, 6\\}$.\n  - The prime implicant $\\overline{A}\\,\\overline{D}$ covers both $m_2$ and $m_6$. Since it is the only PI that covers these remaining minterms, it is also essential for the cover.\n\nSince both prime implicants are essential, the minimal cover must contain both of them. The minimal set of PIs is $\\{\\overline{C}, \\overline{A}\\,\\overline{D}\\}$. The corrected minimal sum-of-products expression is the sum of these PIs.\n\nFinal Corrected Expression: $F(A,B,C,D) = \\overline{C} + \\overline{A}\\,\\overline{D}$.\nThis expression covers the set of minterms $M(\\overline{C}) \\cup M(\\overline{A}\\,\\overline{D}) = \\{0, 1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 12, 13\\} \\cup \\{0, 2, 4, 6\\} = \\{0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13\\}$, which is exactly the on-set $S$.

Based on these, select the statement that correctly explains why parity functions do not minimize well in two-level SOP via Karnaugh maps and justifies, in terms of realistic implementation cost and depth for complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) logic within Electronic Design Automation (EDA), why a multi-level exclusive-or network is typically preferred.\n\nA. In a Gray-coded $4$-variable Karnaugh map, any two adjacent cells differ by exactly one variable, and since flipping one variable changes parity, no two odd-parity minterms are adjacent.

            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of the 4-variable parity function $P(A,B,C,D)=A\\oplus B\\oplus C\\oplus D$ based on first principles to determine why it does not simplify well with two-level logic and why a multi-level implementation is preferred.\n\nThe function $P$ evaluates to $1$ if and only if an odd number of its input variables ($A, B, C, D$) are $1$.\n\nFirst, let us identify the minterms for which $P=1$. These are the input combinations with an odd number of $1$s:\n*   One input is $1$: $0001$ ($m_1$), $0010$ ($m_2$), $0100$ ($m_4$), $1000$ ($m_8$).\n*   Three inputs are $1$: $0111$ ($m_7$), $1011$ ($m_{11}$), $1101$ ($m_{13}$), $1110$ ($m_{14}$).\nThus, the function in sum-of-minterms form is $P = \\Sigma m(1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 11, 13, 14)$. This function has $8$ minterms out of a possible $16$.\n\nNext, we analyze the structure of these minterms on a 4-variable Karnaugh map. The problem states two key principles:\n1.  Adjacent cells in a Karnaugh map correspond to input combinations that differ in exactly one variable.\n2.  The parity of a binary string changes whenever any single bit is flipped.\n\nLet's combine these principles. A cell in the K-map represents an input combination, say $v$. The value of the function in this cell is $P(v)$. Any adjacent cell represents an input combination $v'$ that differs from $v$ in exactly one bit. According to the stated property of parity, the parity of $v$ and $v'$ must be different.\n\nOur function $P$ is designed to be $1$ for odd-parity inputs and $0$ for even-parity inputs. Therefore, if a cell corresponding to minterm $m_i$ contains a $1$ (meaning $m_i$ has odd parity), any adjacent cell must correspond to an input combination with even parity. The function value in any adjacent cell must therefore be $0$.\n\nThis proves that no two cells containing a $1$ can be adjacent on the Karnaugh map. The resulting pattern of $1$s and $0$s is a \"checkerboard\" pattern, where every $1$ is surrounded exclusively by $0$s (in terms of K-map adjacency).\n\nFor two-level sum-of-products (SOP) minimization using a K-map, we group adjacent $1$s to form larger implicants, which correspond to product terms with fewer literals. Since no two $1$s are adjacent for the parity function, no grouping is possible. Each of the $8$ minterms must be covered individually. A single minterm on a 4-variable map corresponds to a product term containing all $4$ variables (literals). Therefore, the minimal SOP expression for $P(A,B,C,D)$ consists of the logical OR of $8$ product terms, each having $4$ literals. This is a very complex expression:\n$P = \\overline{A}\\overline{B}\\overline{C}D + \\overline{A}\\overline{B}C\\overline{D} + \\overline{A}B\\overline{C}\\overline{D} + A\\overline{B}\\overline{C}\\overline{D} + \\overline{A}BCD + A\\overline{B}CD + AB\\overline{C}D + ABC\\overline{D}$.\n\nNow, consider the alternative implementation as a multi-level network of exclusive-or gates. The function $P = A \\oplus B \\oplus C \\oplus D$ can be implemented directly using its definition. A common way is a balanced tree structure: $P = (A \\oplus B) \\oplus (C \\oplus D)$. This requires two 2-input XOR gates in the first level and one 2-input XOR gate in the second level, for a total of $3$ gates. The logic depth is two gate delays.\n\nComparing the two implementations in a practical CMOS EDA context:\n*   **SOP Implementation:** This requires $8$ 4-input AND gates and one $8$-input OR gate. In CMOS technology, gates with high fan-in (more than $3$ or $4$ inputs) are slow and large. An $8$-input OR gate would be synthesized as a tree of smaller, faster gates, increasing the actual logic depth and transistor count significantly. The literal count is $8 \\times 4 = 32$, indicating high routing complexity and area.\n*   **XOR Network:** This requires just $3$ 2-input XOR gates. Standard 2-input XOR gates are efficient library cells in CMOS. The total gate count is low, the fan-in is low, and the logic depth is small ($2$). This results in a much smaller, faster, and lower-power circuit.\n\nTherefore, the multi-level XOR network is vastly superior for implementing parity functions compared to the minimal SOP form.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. In a Gray-coded $4$-variable Karnaugh map, any two adjacent cells differ by exactly one variable, and since flipping one variable changes parity, no two odd-parity minterms are adjacent. Therefore the minimal two-level SOP has $8$ isolated minterms, each a $4$-literal product, while a multi-level cascade of $3$ two-input exclusive-or gates implements the same function with fewer gates and smaller logic depth.**\nThis statement is perfectly aligned with the derivation above. It correctly states the K-map adjacency rule, correctly deduces that no two odd-parity minterms (the '$1$s' of the function) are adjacent, correctly concludes that the minimal SOP consists of $8$ terms with $4$ literals each, and correctly justifies the preference for the XOR network based on gate count and logic depth, which are proxies for implementation cost (area) and performance (delay).\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. Parity functions are unate in all variables, which prevents grouping in Karnaugh maps; however, by complementing variables appropriately, a two-level SOP with $4$ product terms of $2$ literals each is achievable, so multi-level exclusive-or offers no substantial advantage.**\nThis statement is incorrect on multiple counts. A function is unate in a variable if it is monotonic with respect to that variable. The parity function is the canonical example of a **binate** function, as its output can both increase and decrease as a single input is changed (e.g., $P(0,0,0,0)=0$, $P(1,0,0,0)=1$; but $P(0,0,0,1)=1$, $P(1,0,0,1)=0$). The claim that a simpler SOP is achievable is also false, as shown in the derivation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. Diagonal adjacency in Karnaugh maps allows grouping of odd-parity minterms into $2$-cell implicants, yielding a minimal two-level SOP with $4$ product terms of $3$ literals each, making a multi-level exclusive-or implementation unnecessary.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Standard Karnaugh map minimization does not allow for grouping of diagonally adjacent cells. Grouping is only permitted for cells whose binary representations differ by exactly one bit, which corresponds to horizontal or vertical adjacency (with wraparound). Diagonally adjacent cells differ in two bits. The premise of the argument is invalid.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. By wrapping around edges in a Karnaugh map, odd-parity minterms can be grouped into $4$-cell implicants, giving a minimal two-level SOP with $2$ product terms of $2$ literals; exclusive-or networks are only preferred to reduce hazards, not area or delay.**\nThis statement is incorrect. While edge-wrapping is a valid K-map technique, it does not help in this case. As established, no two $1$s are adjacent, even with wraparound. The checkerboard pattern of the parity function makes any form of grouping impossible. Furthermore, the claim that XOR networks are preferred only to reduce hazards is false; their primary advantage here is a dramatic reduction in area and delay (i.e., implementation cost) compared to the unminimized SOP form.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",
