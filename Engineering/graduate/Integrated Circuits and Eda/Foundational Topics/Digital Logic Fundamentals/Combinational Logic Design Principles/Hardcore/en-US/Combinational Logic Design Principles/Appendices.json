            "problem": "In the context of Electronic Design Automation (EDA) for integrated circuits, consider an incompletely specified Boolean function $f:\\{0,1\\}^4 \\to \\{0,1\\}$ of variables $x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4$. The function is specified by its on-set $\\mathcal{F}$, off-set $\\mathcal{R}$, and do not care set $\\mathcal{D}$ over minterms indexed by the conventional binary-to-integer mapping $m = 8x_1 + 4x_2 + 2x_3 + x_4$. The sets are:\n$\\mathcal{F} = \\{m_0, m_1, m_2, m_5, m_8, m_9, m_{10}, m_{13}\\}$,\n$\\mathcal{D} = \\{m_3, m_{11}, m_{15}\\}$,\n$\\mathcal{R} = \\{m_4, m_6, m_7, m_{12}, m_{14}\\}$.\nStarting from the foundational definitions of incompletely specified Boolean functions, implicants, prime implicants, and the duality between sum of products (SOP) and product of sums (POS), derive a minimal SOP and a minimal POS for $f$ by strategically using the set $\\mathcal{D}$ to minimize the forms without covering any elements of $\\mathcal{R}$. For literal counting, define the SOP literal count $L_{\\mathrm{SOP}}$ as the total number of literal occurrences across all product terms in the SOP, and the POS literal count $L_{\\mathrm{POS}}$ as the total number of literal occurrences across all sum clauses in the POS. Here, each occurrence of a variable in complemented or uncomplemented form contributes one literal. Compute the difference $\\Delta = L_{\\mathrm{POS}} - L_{\\mathrm{SOP}}$. Express the final answer as a single real-valued number. No rounding is required and no units are involved.",
            "solution": "We begin from the definitions: an incompletely specified Boolean function assigns output $1$ to minterms in the on-set $\\mathcal{F}$, output $0$ to minterms in the off-set $\\mathcal{R}$, and allows arbitrary assignment (either $0$ or $1$) to minterms in the do not care set $\\mathcal{D}$. In minimization, an implicant for the SOP of $f$ may cover minterms in $\\mathcal{F}$ and $\\mathcal{D}$ but must not cover any minterm in $\\mathcal{R}$; for the SOP of $\\overline{f}$, an implicant may cover minterms in $\\mathcal{R}$ and $\\mathcal{D}$ but must not cover any minterm in $\\mathcal{F}$. A prime implicant is an implicant that cannot be enlarged (by dropping literals) without covering a minterm outside the permissible sets. The duality between SOP and POS is given by De Morgan’s laws and distributivity in Boolean algebra.\n\nStep $1$: Identify structural regularities in $\\mathcal{F}$ enabling large implicants in SOP for $f$. Enumerate the minterms in $\\mathcal{F}$ and $\\mathcal{D}$ with their bit patterns $(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)$:\n$m_0=(0,0,0,0)$, $m_1=(0,0,0,1)$, $m_2=(0,0,1,0)$, $m_5=(0,1,0,1)$, $m_8=(1,0,0,0)$, $m_9=(1,0,0,1)$, $m_{10}=(1,0,1,0)$, $m_{13}=(1,1,0,1)$, and $\\mathcal{D}$ has $m_3=(0,0,1,1)$, $m_{11}=(1,0,1,1)$, $m_{15}=(1,1,1,1)$.\n\nObserve that all minterms with $x_2=0$ are either in $\\mathcal{F}$ or $\\mathcal{D}$: the set $\\{m_0,m_1,m_2,m_3,m_8,m_9,m_{10},m_{11}\\}$ corresponds to $x_2=0$ for all $(x_1,x_3,x_4)$ combinations. None of these is in $\\mathcal{R}$ because every $m \\in \\mathcal{R}$ listed has $x_2=1$. Therefore, the implicant $\\overline{x_2}$ (a single-literal implicant fixing $x_2 = 0$) is valid, covers $m_0,m_1,m_2,m_8,m_9,m_{10}$ in $\\mathcal{F}$ and uses $m_3,m_{11}$ from $\\mathcal{D}$ to expand the implicant to its maximal extent as a prime implicant.\n\nStep $2$: Cover the remaining on-set minterms $m_5=(0,1,0,1)$ and $m_{13}=(1,1,0,1)$, which are not covered by $\\overline{x_2}$. These two differ only in $x_1$, and share $x_2=1$, $x_3=0$, $x_4=1$, so they form an implicant $x_2 \\overline{x_3} x_4$. This implicant does not cover any minterm in $\\mathcal{R}$ because fixing $(x_2,x_3,x_4)=(1,0,1)$ yields the set $\\{m_5,m_{13}\\}$ (and potentially $\\{m_7,m_{15}\\}$ if $x_3$ were $1$, but here $x_3=0$ fixes away that possibility). Both $m_5$ and $m_{13}$ are in $\\mathcal{F}$.\n\nStep $3$: Reduce the SOP via absorption. Using Boolean algebra, $(\\overline{x_2} + x_2 T) = \\overline{x_2} + T$ for any term $T$ because\n$\\overline{x_2} + x_2 T = (\\overline{x_2} + T)(\\overline{x_2} + x_2) = (\\overline{x_2} + T)\\cdot 1 = \\overline{x_2} + T$.\nTaking $T = \\overline{x_3} x_4$, we have\n$\\overline{x_2} + x_2 \\overline{x_3} x_4 = \\overline{x_2} + \\overline{x_3} x_4$.\nTherefore, a minimal SOP is\n$f_{\\mathrm{SOP}} = \\overline{x_2} + \\overline{x_3} x_4$.\nTo confirm minimality, note that $\\overline{x_2}$ is a prime implicant spanning all allowable minterms with $x_2=0$, and $\\overline{x_3} x_4$ is needed to cover $m_5,m_{13}$ which are not covered by $\\overline{x_2}$. No single implicant can cover $m_5$ while avoiding $m_7 \\in \\mathcal{R}$ unless it fixes $\\overline{x_3}=1$ and $x_4=1$, and $x_2$ either fixed to $1$ or left free; leaving $x_2$ free would include $m_1 \\in \\mathcal{F}$ (acceptable) and $m_9 \\in \\mathcal{F}$ (acceptable), but still not cover $m_{13}$ unless $x_2=1$ is included, yielding the chosen $\\overline{x_3} x_4$ implicant as the minimal enlargement consistent with avoiding $\\mathcal{R}$.\n\nStep $4$: Derive a minimal POS via duality. Minimize the SOP of the complement $\\overline{f}$ over $\\mathcal{R} \\cup \\mathcal{D}$ while avoiding $\\mathcal{F}$. The off-set minterms are $m_4=(0,1,0,0)$, $m_6=(0,1,1,0)$, $m_7=(0,1,1,1)$, $m_{12}=(1,1,0,0)$, $m_{14}=(1,1,1,0)$ and the do not cares are $m_3=(0,0,1,1)$, $m_{11}=(1,0,1,1)$, $m_{15}=(1,1,1,1)$. We identify two large implicants for $\\overline{f}$:\n- $x_2 \\overline{x_4}$ covers $\\{m_4,m_6,m_{12},m_{14}\\}$, all in $\\mathcal{R}$, and does not intersect $\\mathcal{F}$.\n- $x_2 x_3$ covers $\\{m_6,m_7,m_{14},m_{15}\\}$, with $\\{m_6,m_7,m_{14}\\} \\subset \\mathcal{R}$ and $m_{15} \\in \\mathcal{D}$, and does not intersect $\\mathcal{F}$.\nThese two implicants cover all of $\\mathcal{R}$. Hence a minimal SOP for $\\overline{f}$ is\n$\\overline{f}_{\\mathrm{SOP}} = x_2 \\overline{x_4} + x_2 x_3$.\nBy De Morgan’s laws,\n$f = (\\overline{f})' = (x_2 \\overline{x_4} + x_2 x_3)' = (x_2 \\overline{x_4})' \\cdot (x_2 x_3)' = (\\overline{x_2} + x_4)\\cdot(\\overline{x_2} + \\overline{x_3})$,\ngiving a POS\n$f_{\\mathrm{POS}} = (\\overline{x_2} + x_4)(\\overline{x_2} + \\overline{x_3})$.\nOptionally, we can verify the equivalence using distributivity $x + yz = (x + y)(x + z)$ by taking $x = \\overline{x_2}$, $y = \\overline{x_3}$, $z = x_4$, which transforms $\\overline{x_2} + \\overline{x_3} x_4$ into $(\\overline{x_2} + \\overline{x_3})(\\overline{x_2} + x_4)$, matching the derived POS.\n\nStep $5$: Compute literal counts. For SOP, $f_{\\mathrm{SOP}} = \\overline{x_2} + \\overline{x_3} x_4$ comprises one term with $1$ literal and one term with $2$ literals, so\n$L_{\\mathrm{SOP}} = 1 + 2 = 3$.\nFor POS, $f_{\\mathrm{POS}} = (\\overline{x_2} + x_4)(\\overline{x_2} + \\overline{x_3})$ comprises two clauses each with $2$ literals, so\n$L_{\\mathrm{POS}} = 2 + 2 = 4$.\nTherefore, the requested difference is\n$\\Delta = L_{\\mathrm{POS}} - L_{\\mathrm{SOP}} = 4 - 3 = 1$.\n\nNo rounding or units are required, and the result is a single real-valued number.",

            "solution": "The critical path for the SOP realization is the sum of the maximum delay through the AND plane (to form a minterm) and the maximum delay through the OR plane (to sum all the minterms).\n\n1.  **AND Plane Delay:** Each minterm is a conjunction of $64$ literals. To implement a $64$-input AND function using a balanced binary tree of $2$-input $\\land$ gates, the number of gate levels in the tree determines the delay. The depth of a balanced binary tree with $N$ inputs is $\\lceil \\log_2(N) \\rceil$.\n    For the AND plane, we have $N = 64$ literals as inputs to form each minterm.\n    The depth of each AND tree is $d_{\\land} = \\lceil \\log_2(64) \\rceil$.\n    Since $64 = 2^6$, we have $d_{\\land} = \\log_2(2^6) = 6$.\n    The delay through the AND plane is $d_{\\land} \\times 1 = 6$ time units.\n\n2.  **OR Plane Delay:** The function $P_{64}$ is the exclusive-or of $64$ variables. This is an odd parity function. The on-set of an $n$-variable parity function (odd or even) consists of $2^{n-1}$ minterms. The prime implicants of the parity function are the minterms themselves, so the minimal SOP form is the disjunction of all minterms in the on-set.\n    For $n=64$, the number of minterms, $M$, is $M = 2^{64-1} = 2^{63}$.\n    These $M$ terms must be combined using a balanced binary tree of $2$-input $\\lor$ gates. The depth of this tree is:\n    $d_{\\lor} = \\lceil \\log_2(M) \\rceil = \\lceil \\log_2(2^{63}) \\rceil = 63$.\n    The delay through the OR plane is $d_{\\lor} \\times 1 = 63$ time units.\n\n3.  **Total SOP Delay:** The total critical-path delay $D_{\\mathrm{SOP}}$ is the sum of the AND plane delay and the OR plane delay.\n    $$D_{\\mathrm{SOP}} = d_{\\land} + d_{\\lor} = 6 + 63 = 69$$\n\nThe second realization uses a multi-level structure based on a balanced binary tree of $2$-input $\\oplus$ modules.\n\n1.  **XOR Module Delay ($d_{\\oplus}$):** First, we must find the delay of a single $2$-input $\\oplus$ module, implemented as $x \\oplus y = (x \\lor y) \\land \\neg(x \\land y)$.

Total cost is $c_2 + c_3 + c_4 = 5 + 2 + 2 = 9$.\n\nComparing the costs of all valid covers found: $\\{\\text{PI}_{1}, \\text{PI}_{2}\\}$ has cost $10$, while both $\\{\\text{PI}_{1}, \\text{PI}_{3}, \\text{PI}_{4}\\}$ and $\\{\\text{PI}_{2}, \\text{PI}_{3}, \\text{PI}_{4}\\}$ have cost $9$.\nThe minimum cost is the lesser of these values.\nThus, the exact minimum cost is $C^{\\star} = 9$.\n\nThis problem structure exemplifies a scenario where the greedy heuristic fails to find the optimal solution. The heuristic is drawn to the large implicants $\\text{PI}_{1}$ and $\\text{PI}_{2}$ because they cover many minterms. However, the optimal solution involves combining one large implicant with two smaller, cheaper ones ($\\text{PI}_{3}$ and $\\text{PI}_{4}$) that efficiently cover the remaining minterms. The cost of the two small PIs ($2+2=4$) is less than the cost of the second large PI ($5$).\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical cost gap $\\Delta$.\n$\\Delta = C(H) - C^{\\star}$\n$\\Delta = 10 - 9 = 1$.\n\nThe cost gap between the heuristic solution and the exact minimum cost solution is $1$.",
