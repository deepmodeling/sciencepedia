It is scientifically grounded in the principles of Boolean algebra and the procedural application of the Quine-McCluskey algorithm.

The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe task is to find the minimal sum-of-products (SOP) expression for the Boolean function $f(x_{4},x_{3},x_{2},x_{1},x_{0})$ defined by the set of on-set minterms $M = \\{0, 8, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24\\}$.

Therefore, **$P_5$ is an EPI**.\n- Minterm $m_{21}$ is only covered by $P_7$. Therefore, **$P_7$ is an EPI**.\n- Minterm $m_{22}$ is only covered by $P_7$.\n- Minterm $m_{23}$ is only covered by $P_7$.\n- Minterm $m_{24}$ is only covered by $P_5$.\n\nWe must include $P_5$ and $P_7$ in our minimal cover. These EPIs cover the following minterms:\n- $P_5$ covers $\\{0, 8, 16, 24\\}$.\n- $P_7$ covers $\\{20, 21, 22, 23\\}$.\n\nThe set of remaining uncovered minterms is $M_{rem} = M - (\\{0, 8, 16, 24\\} \\cup \\{20, 21, 22, 23\\}) = \\{10, 11, 14, 15\\}$.\n\n**Step 2b: Solve the Reduced Covering Problem**\nWe need to find a minimal set of PIs to cover $M_{rem} = \\{10, 11, 14, 15\\}$. The relevant PIs from the original chart are those that cover at least one of these minterms: $P_1, P_3, P_4, P_6$.\n\n| PI | 10 | 11 | 14 | 15 |\n|:---|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|\n| $P_1$ | X | | | |\n| $P_3$ | X | X | | |\n| $P_4$ | | | X | X |\n| $P_6$ | X | X | X | X |\n\nIn this reduced chart, we can see by row dominance that PI $P_6$ covers all the minterms that $P_1$, $P_3$, and $P_4$ cover. Selecting the single term $P_6$ is the most efficient choice. Any other selection would require at least two terms (specifically, $P_3$ and $P_4$). Therefore, we select $P_6$.\n\nThis can be proven formally using Petrick's Method. The covering requirement is expressed as a Boolean product of sums:\n$C = (P_1 + P_3 + P_6) \\cdot (P_3 + P_6) \\cdot (P_4 + P_6) \\cdot (P_4 + P_6)$\nUsing the absorption law $A (A+B) = A$:\n$C = (P_3 + P_6) \\cdot (P_4 + P_6)$\nExpanding using the distributive law:\n$C = P_3 P_4 + P_3 P_6 + P_6 P_4 + P_6 P_6$\nUsing idempotence ($A A = A$) and absorption ($A + AB = A$):\n$C = P_3 P_4 + P_6$\nThis expression indicates two possible covers for the remaining minterms: $\\{P_3, P_4\\}$ or $\\{P_6\\}$. The minimal cover is the one with the fewest terms. $\\{P_6\\}$ is a cover with one term, whereas $\\{P_3, P_4\\}$ requires two. Thus, the minimal choice is $P_6$.\n\n**Part 3: Final Minimal SOP Expression**\n\nThe minimal set of PIs that covers the entire function is $\\{P_5, P_6, P_7\\}$. The resulting minimal SOP expression is the sum of these three prime implicants:\n$f(x_4,x_3,x_2,x_1,x_0) = P_5 + P_6 + P_7$\n\nSubstituting their algebraic forms:\n$f(x_4,x_3,x_2,x_1,x_0) = \\bar{x_2} \\bar{x_1} \\bar{x_0} + \\bar{x_4} x_3 x_1 + x_4 \\bar{x_3} x_2$\n\nThis cover is minimal. The procedure guarantees that all PIs were found. The choice of EPIs is mandatory. The subsequent choice of $P_6$ was proven to be minimal for the remaining subproblem. Therefore, the resulting three-term expression is a minimal SOP form. The number of literals is $3+3+3=9$. The alternative cover $\\{P_5, P_7, P_3, P_4\\}$ would have four terms and $3+3+4+4=14$ literals, which is not minimal.",

By definition, $f(x_{3},x_{2},x_{1},x_{0})=1$ if and only if an odd number of inputs are $1$. This is the exclusive OR (XOR) function.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the PPRM Expansion\n\nThe problem specifies the use of Boolean algebra over the Galois Field $\\mathbb{F}_{2}$, where addition is XOR ($\\oplus$) and multiplication is logical AND. The PPRM expansion is a polynomial in this algebra using only uncomplemented variables. The general form is:\n$$\nf(x_{3},x_{2},x_{1},x_{0})=\\bigoplus_{S\\subseteq\\{0,1,2,3\\}} c_{S}\\,\\prod_{i\\in S} x_{i}\n$$\nwhere the coefficients $c_{S} \\in \\{0,1\\}$ are constants. The term $\\prod_{i\\in S} x_{i}$ represents the logical AND of variables whose indices are in the set $S$, and the empty product (for $S=\\emptyset$) is defined as $1$.\n\nThe coefficients $c_S$ can be derived from first principles using the relation:\n$$\nc_S = \\bigoplus_{T \\subseteq S} f(v_T)\n$$\nwhere $v_T$ is the input vector $(x_3, x_2, x_1, x_0)$ such that $x_i=1$ if $i \\in T$ and $x_i=0$ if $i \\notin T$.\nThe function $f(v_T)$ is $1$ if the number of ones in $v_T$, which is $|T|$, is odd. Otherwise, $f(v_T)=0$.\nThus, the expression for the coefficients simplifies to:\n$$\nc_S = \\bigoplus_{T \\subseteq S, |T|\\text{ is odd}} 1\n$$\nThis sum is equivalent to counting the number of odd-cardinality subsets of $S$, modulo $2$. Let $|S|=k$. The number of subsets of $S$ of size $j$ is $\\binom{k}{j}$. The total number of odd-cardinality subsets is $\\sum_{j \\text{ odd}} \\binom{k}{j}$. From the binomial theorem, we know that for $k \\ge 1$:\n$$\n\\sum_{j \\text{ odd}} \\binom{k}{j} = \\binom{k}{1} + \\binom{k}{3} + \\dots = 2^{k-1}\n$$\nSo, $c_S = (2^{k-1}) \\pmod 2$.\n\nWe evaluate this for different values of $k=|S|$:\n- For $S = \\emptyset$, $k=0$. The set of odd-cardinality subsets is empty, so the sum is $0$. Thus, $c_{\\emptyset}=0$.\n- For $|S|=1$ (i.e., $S=\\{0\\}, \\{1\\}, \\{2\\}, \\{3\\}$), $k=1$. $c_S = (2^{1-1}) \\pmod 2 = 2^0 \\pmod 2 = 1 \\pmod 2 = 1$. So, $c_{\\{0\\}}=c_{\\{1\\}}=c_{\\{2\\}}=c_{\\{3\\}}=1$.\n- For $|S| \\geq 2$ (e.g., $S=\\{0,1\\}$), $k \\geq 2$. Then $k-1 \\geq 1$, so $2^{k-1}$ is an even number. Thus, $c_S = (2^{k-1}) \\pmod 2 = 0$.\n\nThe only non-zero coefficients are for the singleton sets. Substituting these coefficients back into the general PPRM form gives:\n$$\nf(x_{3},x_{2},x_{1},x_{0}) = c_{\\{0\\}}x_0 \\oplus c_{\\{1\\}}x_1 \\oplus c_{\\{2\\}}x_2 \\oplus c_{\\{3\\}}x_3 = 1 \\cdot x_0 \\oplus 1 \\cdot x_1 \\oplus 1 \\cdot x_2 \\oplus 1 \\cdot x_3\n$$\nThe derived PPRM expansion for the $4$-input odd-parity function is:\n$$\nf(x_{3},x_{2},x_{1},x_{0}) = x_3 \\oplus x_2 \\oplus x_1 \\oplus x_0\n$$\n\n### Part 2: Area of the PPRM Implementation\n\nThe PPRM expression $x_3 \\oplus x_2 \\oplus x_1 \\oplus x_0$ is a $4$-input XOR function. It contains no AND terms (of degree greater than $1$) and no complemented variables, so no AND2 or INV gates are required for its direct implementation. We must implement the $4$-input XOR using a tree of $2$-input XOR (XOR2) gates. A balanced tree structure is efficient:\n- One XOR2 gate computes $y_1 = x_1 \\oplus x_0$.\n- A second XOR2 gate computes $y_2 = x_3 \\oplus x_2$.\n- A third XOR2 gate computes the final output $f = y_1 \\oplus y_2$.\nThis requires a total of $3$ XOR2 gates.\nThe area cost of an XOR2 gate is given as $5$ area units.\nArea(PPRM) = $3 \\times \\text{Area(XOR2)} = 3 \\times 5 = 15$ area units.\n\n### Part 3: Area of the Minimal SOP Implementation\n\nTo find the minimal two-level sum-of-products (SOP) implementation, we use a Karnaugh map for the variables $(x_3, x_2, x_1, x_0)$. The function is $1$ for all input combinations with an odd number of $1$s. These correspond to minterms $m_1, m_2, m_4, m_7, m_8, m_{11}, m_{13}, m_{14}$.\nThe $4$-variable K-map is:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cccc}\n\\large{x_3x_2 \\backslash x_1x_0} & \\bf{00} & \\bf{01} & \\bf{11} & \\bf{10} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\bf{00} & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n\\bf{01} & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n\\bf{11} & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n\\bf{10} & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThis K-map exhibits a \"checkerboard\" pattern. No two $1$s are adjacent, which means no minterms can be grouped to simplify the expression. Therefore, the minimal SOP form is simply the disjunctive normal form (DNF), which is the sum (logical OR) of all $8$ minterms where the function is true.\nThe expression is:\n$f = \\bar{x}_3\\bar{x}_2\\bar{x}_1x_0 + \\bar{x}_3\\bar{x}_2x_1\\bar{x}_0 + \\bar{x}_3x_2\\bar{x}_1\\bar{x}_0 + x_3\\bar{x}_2\\bar{x}_1\\bar{x}_0 + \\bar{x}_3x_2x_1x_0 + x_3\\bar{x}_2x_1x_0 + x_3x_2\\bar{x}_1x_0 + x_3x_2x_1\\bar{x}_0$.\n\nThe area calculation for this network is as follows:\n1.  **Inverters (INV)**: The expression requires all four variables and their complements ($\\bar{x}_3, \\bar{x}_2, \\bar{x}_1, \\bar{x}_0$). Since the primary inputs are uncomplemented, we need $4$ inverters. These can be shared among all product terms.\n    Area(INV) = $4 \\times \\text{Area(INV)} = 4 \\times 1 = 4$ area units.\n\n2.  **AND gates (AND2)**: There are $8$ product terms. Each term is an AND of $4$ literals. A $4$-input AND function requires a tree of $4-1=3$ two-input AND2 gates.\n    Total AND2 gates = $8 \\text{ terms} \\times 3 \\text{ gates/term} = 24$ gates.\n    Area(AND) = $24 \\times \\text{Area(AND2)} = 24 \\times 2 = 48$ area units.\n\n3.  **OR gates (OR2)**: The final expression is a sum of $8$ product terms. This requires an $8$-input OR function, which is implemented as a tree of $8-1=7$ two-input OR2 gates.\n    Total OR2 gates = $7$ gates.\n    Area(OR) = $7 \\times \\text{Area(OR2)} = 7 \\times 2 = 14$ area units.\n\nTotal SOP area is the sum of these costs:\nArea(SOP) = Area(INV) + Area(AND) + Area(OR) = $4 + 48 + 14 = 66$ area units.\n\n### Part 4: Ratio of Areas\n\nThe final step is to compute the ratio of the SOP area to the PPRM area.\n$$\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Area(SOP)}}{\\text{Area(PPRM)}} = \\frac{66}{15}\n$$\nThis fraction simplifies by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $3$:\n$$\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{66 \\div 3}{15 \\div 3} = \\frac{22}{5}\n$$\nAs a single exact number, this is $\\frac{22}{5}$.",

The body connections are conventional: all $p$-channel metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (PMOS) bodies are tied to $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$, and all $n$-channel metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (NMOS) bodies are tied to $G$.\n\nThe pull-down network (PDN) consists of:\n- One NMOS $N_{A}$ with its source tied to $Y$, its drain tied to an internal node $N_{X}$, and gate driven by $A$.\n- One NMOS $N_{B}$ with its source tied to $N_{X}$, its drain tied to $G$, and gate driven by $B$.\n\nThe pull-up network (PUN) consists of three PMOS devices in parallel between $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$ and $Y$:\n- One PMOS $P_{A}$ with source at $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$, drain at $Y$, and gate driven by $A$.\n- One PMOS $P_{B}$ with source at $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$, drain at $Y$, and gate driven by $B$.\n- One PMOS $P_{C}$ with source at $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$, drain at $Y$, and gate driven by $C$.\n\nAssume the following idealized static interpretation for logic evaluation, suitable for first-principles reasoning:\n- An NMOS channel conducts if and only if its gate input equals logic $1$; a PMOS channel conducts if and only if its gate input equals logic $0$.\n- A series chain conducts if and only if all series devices in the chain conduct; parallel branches conduct if and only if at least one branch conducts.\n- The logic value at $Y$ is interpreted as $0$ if there exists any conducting path from $Y$ to $G$ through the PDN. If no such path exists but at least one conducting path from $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$ to $Y$ exists through the PUN, the logic value at $Y$ is interpreted as $1$. You may assume device sizing and thresholding are such that any simultaneous PUN and PDN conduction resolves to a valid logic $0$ at $Y$, and cases with both PUN and PDN non-conducting do not occur for the topology given.\n\nTasks:\n- Using only the fundamental device conduction rules above and series–parallel abstraction, identify the topological errors in this “supposed NOR” relative to a correct two-input NOR realization. In particular, address whether complementary symmetry between the PDN and PUN appropriate for a two-input NOR is satisfied or violated, and whether any unmatched devices exist across the PDN and PUN.\n- From these principles, derive the exact Boolean function $Y(A,B,C)$ realized by the given topology and simplify it to a minimal closed-form Boolean expression in terms of $A$, $B$, and $C$.\n- Your final answer must be a single closed-form Boolean expression. Do not provide a truth table or an equation. No numerical rounding is required. Express Boolean OR as $+$, Boolean AND as $\\cdot$, and Boolean complementation as an overbar.\n\nProvide only the final simplified Boolean expression as your final answer.",
            "solution": "The problem provides a description of a static CMOS logic cell and asks for a verification of its claimed function as a \"two-input NOR,\" an identification of any topological errors, and a derivation of the correct Boolean function it realizes. The validation of the problem statement must precede any attempt at a solution.\n\n### Problem Validation\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- **Cell Inputs:** $A$, $B$, $C$.\n- **Cell Output:** $Y$.\n- **Power Rails:** $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$ (power), $G$ (ground).\n- **Body Connections:** All PMOS bodies to $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$, all NMOS bodies to $G$.\n- **Pull-Down Network (PDN):**\n    - NMOS $N_{A}$: source at $Y$, drain at internal node $N_{X}$, gate driven by $A$.\n    - NMOS $N_{B}$: source at $N_{X}$, drain at $G$, gate driven by $B$.\n    This describes a series connection of $N_A$ and $N_B$ between $Y$ and $G$. Note that the source/drain labels for $N_A$ are unconventional for a pull-down action, where current flows from $Y$ to $G$; standard convention would label the terminal at $Y$ as the drain and the terminal at $N_X$ as the source. However, the topological description of a series chain is unambiguous.\n- **Pull-Up Network (PUN):**\n    - PMOS $P_{A}$: source at $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$, drain at $Y$, gate driven by $A$.\n    - PMOS $P_{B}$: source at $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$, drain at $Y$, gate driven by $B$.\n    - PMOS $P_{C}$: source at $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$, drain at $Y$, gate driven by $C$.\n    This is a parallel connection of three PMOS transistors between $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$ and $Y$.\n- **Idealized Logic Evaluation Rules:**\n    - An NMOS conducts if its gate is logic $1$.\n    - A PMOS conducts if its gate is logic $0$.\n    - A series chain conducts if all devices conduct.\n    - A parallel network conducts if at least one device conducts.\n    - Output $Y$ is logic $0$ if a conducting path exists from $Y$ to $G$ (PDN conducts).\n    - Output $Y$ is logic $1$ if no path to $G$ exists but a path from $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$ to $Y$ exists (PUN conducts).\n    - Simultaneous conduction of PUN and PDN results in $Y=0$.\n    - The case where both PUN and PDN are non-conducting is assumed not to occur.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly rooted in the principles of digital integrated circuit design, specifically static CMOS logic. The transistor models are idealized but standard for first-principles Boolean analysis. All concepts (PUN, PDN, series/parallel networks, complementary logic) are fundamental to the field.\n- **Well-Posed:** The circuit topology is fully described. The rules for determining the output logic level are explicit and sufficient to derive a unique Boolean function. The task is clear and leads to a single, verifiable answer.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, technical language, free from subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe analysis proceeds by first determining the Boolean conditions under which the PDN and PUN conduct, then identifying the structural flaws relative to a correct two-input NOR gate, and finally deriving the actual logic function implemented by the cell.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Pull-Down Network (PDN)**\nThe PDN consists of two NMOS transistors, $N_A$ and $N_B$, connected in series between the output node $Y$ and ground $G$. According to the provided rules, a series chain conducts if and only if all devices in the chain conduct.\n- $N_A$ conducts if its gate input $A$ is logic $1$.\n- $N_B$ conducts if its gate input $B$ is logic $1$.\nTherefore, the PDN establishes a conducting path from $Y$ to $G$ if and only if both $N_A$ and $N_B$ are conducting. The Boolean expression for the PDN's conduction, let's denote it as $F_{PDN}$, is the logical AND of its inputs.\n$$F_{PDN} = A \\cdot B$$\nAccording to the evaluation rules, if the PDN conducts, the output $Y$ is pulled to logic $0$. Thus, $Y=0$ when $A \\cdot B = 1$.\n\n**2. Analysis of the Pull-Up Network (PUN)**\nThe PUN consists of three PMOS transistors, $P_A$, $P_B$, and $P_C$, connected in parallel between the power rail $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$ and the output node $Y$. A parallel network conducts if at least one of its branches conducts.\n- $P_A$ conducts if its gate input $A$ is logic $0$, which corresponds to the Boolean condition $\\bar{A}$.\n- $P_B$ conducts if its gate input $B$ is logic $0$, which corresponds to the Boolean condition $\\bar{B}$.\n- $P_C$ conducts if its gate input $C$ is logic $0$, which corresponds to the Boolean condition $\\bar{C}$.\nThe PUN establishes a conducting path from $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$ to $Y$ if $P_A$ conducts OR $P_B$ conducts OR $P_C$ conducts. The Boolean expression for the PUN's conduction, $F_{PUN}$, is the logical OR of these conditions.\n$$F_{PUN} = \\bar{A} + \\bar{B} + \\bar{C}$$\n\n**3. Topological Error Analysis vs. Correct Two-Input NOR**\nThe claim is that the cell is a \"two-input NOR.\" A standard static complementary CMOS two-input NOR gate realizes the function $Y = \\overline{A+B}$. Its structure is dictated by De Morgan's duality principle.\n- **Correct NOR2 PDN:** To implement the function $Y = \\overline{A+B}$, the PDN must implement the function $A+B$. This requires two NMOS transistors in **parallel**, controlled by inputs $A$ and $B$.\n- **Correct NOR2 PUN:** The PUN must be the topological dual of the PDN. This requires two PMOS transistors in **series**, controlled by inputs $A$ and $B$.\n\nComparing the given cell to this correct structure reveals several critical violations:\n- **PDN Topology Violation:** The given PDN has its NMOS devices in series, implementing $A \\cdot B$. A NOR gate requires them to be in parallel to implement $A+B$. The PDN topology is that of a NAND gate, not a NOR gate.\n- **PUN Topology Violation:** The given PUN has its PMOS devices in parallel. While a standard NAND gate would have its PMOS devices in parallel, a NOR gate requires them to be in series.\n- **Violation of Complementary Symmetry:** For a gate to be fully complementary, its PUN must be the topological dual of its PDN, and there must be a one-to-one correspondence of transistors for each input.\n    - The dual of the given PDN (series NMOS $N_A$, $N_B$) would be a parallel PUN with two PMOS transistors, $P_A$ and $P_B$.\n    - The given PUN has three parallel PMOS transistors ($P_A$, $P_B$, $P_C$).\n    - The presence of the transistor $P_C$ controlled by input $C$ in the PUN, with no corresponding transistor in the PDN, is a direct violation of complementary symmetry. $P_C$ is an **unmatched device**.\n- **Incorrect Input Count:** The cell is described as a \"two-input\" gate but has three inputs: $A$, $B$, and $C$.\n\n**4. Derivation of the Actual Boolean Function $Y(A,B,C)$**\nThe output logic level is determined by the state of the PDN and PUN.\n- **Condition for $Y=0$:** The output $Y$ is logic $0$ if the PDN conducts, regardless of the PUN's state (as contention is resolved to $0$). The PDN conducts when $F_{PDN} = A \\cdot B = 1$.\n- **Condition for $Y=1$:** The output $Y$ is logic $1$ if the PDN does not conduct AND the PUN conducts.\n    - The PDN does not conduct if $F_{PDN} = 0$, which means $\\overline{A \\cdot B} = 1$, or $\\bar{A} + \\bar{B} = 1$.\n    - The PUN conducts if $F_{PUN} = \\bar{A} + \\bar{B} + \\bar{C} = 1$.\n    - We must check if the condition for the PDN being off ($\\bar{A} + \\bar{B} = 1$) implies that the PUN is on ($\\bar{A} + \\bar{B} + \\bar{C} = 1$). If $\\bar{A} + \\bar{B} = 1$, then adding any term $\\bar{C}$ in an OR operation, as in $(\\bar{A} + \\bar{B}) + \\bar{C}$, will result in $1$. Therefore, whenever the PDN is off, the PUN is guaranteed to be on.\n- **Conclusion:**\n    - If $A \\cdot B = 1$, then $Y = 0$.\n    - If $\\overline{A \\cdot B} = 1$, then $Y = 1$.\nThese two conditions completely define the output function. The function is $1$ if and only if the condition $A \\cdot B$ is false. This is, by definition, the NAND function.\n$$Y(A,B,C) = \\overline{A \\cdot B}$$\nThe input $C$ has no effect on the steady-state logic function at the output $Y$. Its only effect is to create a direct path from $V_{\\mathrm{DD}}$ to $G$ (through $P_C$, $N_A$, and $N_B$) when $A=1$, $B=1$, and $C=0$, leading to static power dissipation, which is undesirable but does not alter the logical output value due to the stated contention resolution rule. The minimal closed-form Boolean expression for the realized function is thus independent of $C$.\n\nFinal Answer: The simplified Boolean expression for the output $Y$ is $\\overline{A \\cdot B}$.",
