It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to determine a unique solution. The problem describes the thermal oxidation of silicon, a fundamental process in microfabrication, and asks for a quantitative comparison of process times under different oxidant conditions. The model described, based on steady-state diffusion and a first-order surface reaction, is the well-established Deal-Grove model.\n\nThe Deal-Grove model for planar oxidation describes the growth of an oxide layer of thickness $x$ as a function of time $t$. The model's integrated form is given by the quadratic equation:\n$$x^2(t) + A \\cdot x(t) = B (t + \\tau)$$\nwhere $B$ is the parabolic rate constant, related to the diffusion of oxidant species through the oxide, and $A$ is a constant related to the linear rate constant $B/A$, which is related to the reaction rate at the silicon-oxide interface. Both $B$ and $A$ are functions of temperature $T$. The term $\\tau$ is a time constant that accounts for any initial oxide layer, $x_0$, present at the start of the process ($t=0$).\n\nThe time constant $\\tau$ is determined by the initial condition $x(t=0) = x_0$:\n$$x_0^2 + A \\cdot x_0 = B \\tau \\implies \\tau = \\frac{x_0^2 + A \\cdot x_0}{B}$$\nThe time $t_f$ required to reach a final thickness $x_f$ is given by:\n$$x_f^2 + A \\cdot x_f = B (t_f + \\tau)$$\nSolving for the process duration $t_f$:\n$$t_f = \\frac{x_f^2 + A \\cdot x_f}{B} - \\tau$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\tau$:\n$$t_f = \\frac{x_f^2 + A \\cdot x_f}{B} - \\frac{x_0^2 + A \\cdot x_0}{B}$$\nThis simplifies to the expression for the time interval to grow the oxide from thickness $x_0$ to $x_f$:\n$$t_f = \\frac{(x_f^2 - x_0^2) + A \\cdot (x_f - x_0)}{B}$$\nWe are given the rate constants $B$ and $B/A$.

A full solution is warranted.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution will be derived from first principles for both the target erosion rate and the wafer deposition rate. A critical step is interpreting the sputter yield. The yield $Y$ is given in \"atoms per incident ion\". For a compound target like silicon dioxide ($SiO_2$), this refers to the total number of ejected atoms (silicon and oxygen). Since stoichiometry is preserved, for every one silicon atom sputtered, two oxygen atoms are sputtered. Thus, a single sputtered $SiO_2$ formula unit corresponds to the ejection of $3$ atoms.\n\n**1. Target Erosion Rate ($\\dot{T}_{\\mathrm{erosion}}$)**\n\nFirst, we determine the rate at which ions bombard the target. The current $I$ is the flow of charge per unit time. Since the argon ions are singly ionized, each carries a charge of $e$. The rate of ions incident on the target, $\\dot{N}_{\\mathrm{ion}}$, is:\n$$ \\dot{N}_{\\mathrm{ion}} = \\frac{I}{e} $$\nThe sputter yield $Y$ is the number of atoms ejected per incident ion. The total rate of atom ejection from the target, $\\dot{N}_{\\mathrm{atom,sput}}$, is:\n$$ \\dot{N}_{\\mathrm{atom,sput}} = Y \\cdot \\dot{N}_{\\mathrm{ion}} = \\frac{YI}{e} $$\nAs established, each sputtered $SiO_2$ formula unit consists of $3$ atoms. Therefore, the rate of $SiO_2$ formula units sputtered from the target, $\\dot{N}_{\\mathrm{SiO_2,sput}}$, is:\n$$ \\dot{N}_{\\mathrm{SiO_2,sput}} = \\frac{\\dot{N}_{\\mathrm{atom,sput}}}{3} = \\frac{YI}{3e} $$\nNext, we find the volume occupied by a single $SiO_2$ formula unit. The number density $n_{\\mathrm{SiO_2}}$ (formula units per unit volume) in the solid target is given by:\n$$ n_{\\mathrm{SiO_2}} = \\frac{\\rho N_{A}}{M_{\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}}} $$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the density, $N_A$ is the Avogadro constant, and $M_{\\mathrm{SiO_{2}}}$ is the molar mass.\nThe total volume of material eroded from the target per unit time, $\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{erosion}}$, is the rate of sputtered formula units divided by the number density:\n$$ \\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{erosion}} = \\frac{\\dot{N}_{\\mathrm{SiO_2,sput}}}{n_{\\mathrm{SiO_2}}} = \\left(\\frac{YI}{3e}\\right) \\left(\\frac{M_{\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}}}{\\rho N_{A}}\\right) = \\frac{Y I M_{\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}}}{3 e \\rho N_{A}} $$\nThe target erosion rate, $\\dot{T}_{\\mathrm{erosion}}$, is the volume erosion rate divided by the area over which erosion occurs, $A_t$.\n$$ \\dot{T}_{\\mathrm{erosion}} = \\frac{\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{erosion}}}{A_{t}} = \\frac{Y I M_{\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}}}{3 e \\rho N_{A} A_{t}} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$Y = 1.10$, $I = 0.350\\,\\mathrm{A}$, $M_{\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}} = 60.0843\\,\\mathrm{g/mol}$, $e = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$, $\\rho = 2.20\\,\\mathrm{g/cm}^{3}$, $N_{A} = 6.02214076 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, and $A_{t} = 120\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2}$.\n$$ \\dot{T}_{\\mathrm{erosion}} = \\frac{(1.10)(0.350\\,\\mathrm{C/s})(60.0843\\,\\mathrm{g/mol})}{3(1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C})(2.20\\,\\mathrm{g/cm}^{3})(6.02214076 \\times 10^{23}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1})(120\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{2})} $$\n$$ \\dot{T}_{\\mathrm{erosion}} \\approx 3.03448 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{cm/s} $$\nTo express the rate in $\\mathrm{nm/s}$, we use the conversion $1\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 10^7\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n$$ \\dot{T}_{\\mathrm{erosion}} \\approx 3.03448 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{cm/s} \\times \\frac{10^7\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{1\\,\\mathrm{cm}} \\approx 3.03448\\,\\mathrm{nm/s} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the erosion rate is $3.03\\,\\mathrm{nm/s}$.\n\n**2. Wafer Deposition Rate ($\\dot{T}_{\\mathrm{deposit}}$)**\n\nThe rate of $SiO_2$ formula units sputtered from the target is $\\dot{N}_{\\mathrm{SiO_2,sput}} = \\frac{YI}{3e}$.\nNot all sputtered material reaches the wafer. The geometric collection efficiency, $f_{\\mathrm{geo}}$, accounts for the fraction of sputtered flux that is intercepted by the wafer. The rate of formula units arriving at the wafer is:\n$$ \\dot{N}_{\\mathrm{arrive}} = \\dot{N}_{\\mathrm{SiO_2,sput}} \\cdot f_{\\mathrm{geo}} = \\frac{Y I f_{\\mathrm{geo}}}{3e} $$\nOf the material that arrives, not all of it adheres. The sticking coefficient, $s$, gives the fraction that deposits. The rate of formula units depositing on the wafer, $\\dot{N}_{\\mathrm{deposit}}$, is:\n$$ \\dot{N}_{\\mathrm{deposit}} = \\dot{N}_{\\mathrm{arrive}} \\cdot s = \\frac{Y I f_{\\mathrm{geo}} s}{3e} $$\nThe volume of film deposited on the wafer per unit time, $\\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{deposit}}$, is found by dividing the deposition rate of formula units by the number density of the film (which is the same as the target):\n$$ \\dot{V}_{\\mathrm{deposit}} = \\frac{\\dot{N}_{\\mathrm{deposit}}}{n_{\\mathrm{SiO_2}}} = \\left(\\frac{Y I f_{\\mathrm{geo}} s}{3e}\\right) \\left(\\frac{M_{\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}}}{\\rho N_{A}}\\right) = \\frac{Y I f_{\\mathrm{geo}} s M_{\\mathrm{SiO}_{2}}}{3 e \\rho N_{A}} $$\nThe deposition is assumed to be uniform over the wafer's circular area, $A_{w}$.

The incremental sidewall area within this CV is $dA_{side} = 2 \\times 1 \\times dz = 2\\,dz$.\n\nAt steady state, the principle of mass conservation states that the rate of moles diffusing into the CV must equal the sum of the rate of moles diffusing out of the CV and the rate of moles consumed by surface reaction within the CV.\n$$\n(\\text{Molar flow in at } z) - (\\text{Molar flow out at } z+dz) - (\\text{Molar consumption on sidewalls}) = 0\n$$\n\nThe molar flow rate is the product of molar flux, $J_z$, and the cross-sectional area, $w$. The molar consumption rate is the product of the surface reaction flux, $j_{\\mathrm{surf}}$, and the sidewall surface area, $2\\,dz$.\n$$\n[w \\cdot J_z(z)] - [w \\cdot J_z(z+dz)] - [j_{\\mathrm{surf}}(z) \\cdot (2\\,dz)] = 0\n$$\n\nThe problem states a first-order surface reaction, so the reaction flux is $j_{\\mathrm{surf}}(z) = k_s C(z)$, where $k_s$ is the surface reaction coefficient and $C(z)$ is the local precursor concentration. Fick's first law gives the diffusive flux as $J_z(z) = -D \\frac{dC}{dz}$, where $D$ is the effective diffusivity.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the mass balance:\n$$\nw \\left(-D \\frac{dC}{dz}\\right)\\bigg|_z - w \\left(-D \\frac{dC}{dz}\\right)\\bigg|_{z+dz} - k_s C(z) (2\\,dz) = 0\n$$\nRearranging the terms:\n$$\nwD \\left[ \\left(\\frac{dC}{dz}\\right)\\bigg|_{z+dz} - \\left(\\frac{dC}{dz}\\right)\\bigg|_z \\right] - 2 k_s C(z) dz = 0\n$$\nDividing the entire equation by the volume of the element, $w \\cdot dz$:\n$$\nD \\frac{\\left(\\frac{dC}{dz}\\right)\\big|_{z+dz} - \\left(\\frac{dC}{dz}\\right)\\big|_z}{dz} - \\frac{2k_s}{w} C(z) = 0\n$$\nTaking the limit as $dz \\to 0$, the first term becomes the definition of the second derivative:\n$$\nD \\frac{d^2C}{dz^2} - \\frac{2k_s}{w} C(z) = 0\n$$\nThis can be rewritten in the standard form for a second-order linear homogeneous ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2C}{dz^2} - \\lambda^2 C(z) = 0, \\quad \\text{where} \\quad \\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{2k_s}{wD}}\n$$\nThe parameter $\\lambda$ has units of inverse length ($\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$) and characterizes the length scale over which the concentration depletes.\n\n**2. Derivation of Boundary Conditions**\n\nTo solve this second-order ODE, two boundary conditions are required.\n1.  At the trench opening ($z=0$): The precursor concentration is given as a constant value, $C_0$.\n    $$\n    C(0) = C_0\n    $$\n2.  At the trench bottom ($z=h$): The bottom surface is also a reactive sink. The flux of precursor molecules diffusing to the bottom surface must be entirely consumed by the reaction on that surface. The diffusive flux at $z=h$ is $J_z(h) = -D \\frac{dC}{dz}\\big|_{z=h}$. The reaction flux on the bottom surface is $j_{\\mathrm{surf}}(h) = k_s C(h)$. The mass balance at this boundary surface is:\n    $$\n    (\\text{Diffusive flux to surface}) = (\\text{Reaction flux on surface})\n    $$\n    $$\n    J_z(h) = j_{\\mathrm{surf}}(h)\n    $$\n    $$\n    -D \\frac{dC}{dz}\\bigg|_{z=h} = k_s C(h)\n    $$\n    This is a Robin (or mixed) boundary condition.\n\n**3. Solution of the Boundary Value Problem**\n\nThe general solution to the ODE $\\frac{d^2C}{dz^2} - \\lambda^2 C = 0$ is conveniently expressed using hyperbolic functions:\n$$\nC(z) = A \\cosh(\\lambda z) + B \\sinh(\\lambda z)\n$$\nThe constants $A$ and $B$ are determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nApplying the first boundary condition, $C(0) = C_0$:\n$$\nC_0 = A \\cosh(0) + B \\sinh(0) = A \\cdot 1 + B \\cdot 0 \\implies A = C_0\n$$\nThe solution becomes:\n$$\nC(z) = C_0 \\cosh(\\lambda z) + B \\sinh(\\lambda z)\n$$\nTo find $B$, we use the boundary condition at $z=h$. First, we find the derivative of $C(z)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dz} = C_0 \\lambda \\sinh(\\lambda z) + B \\lambda \\cosh(\\lambda z)\n$$\nApplying $-D \\frac{dC}{dz}\\big|_{z=h} = k_s C(h)$:\n$$\n-D (C_0 \\lambda \\sinh(\\lambda h) + B \\lambda \\cosh(\\lambda h)) = k_s (C_0 \\cosh(\\lambda h) + B \\sinh(\\lambda h))\n$$\nSolving for $B$:\n$$\n-D C_0 \\lambda \\sinh(\\lambda h) - k_s C_0 \\cosh(\\lambda h) = B (D \\lambda \\cosh(\\lambda h) + k_s \\sinh(\\lambda h))\n$$\n$$\nB = -C_0 \\frac{D \\lambda \\sinh(\\lambda h) + k_s \\cosh(\\lambda h)}{D \\lambda \\cosh(\\lambda h) + k_s \\sinh(\\lambda h)}\n$$\nSubstituting $B$ back into the expression for $C(z)$ and simplifying using hyperbolic identities $\\cosh(x-y) = \\cosh(x)\\cosh(y) - \\sinh(x)\\sinh(y)$ and $\\sinh(x-y) = \\sinh(x)\\cosh(y) - \\cosh(x)\\sinh(y)$ leads to the final expression for the concentration profile:\n$$\nC(z) = C_0 \\frac{D \\lambda \\cosh(\\lambda(h-z)) + k_s \\sinh(\\lambda(h-z))}{D \\lambda \\cosh(\\lambda h) + k_s \\sinh(\\lambda h)}\n$$\nThis expression can be simplified by dividing the numerator and denominator by $D\\lambda$:\n$$\nC(z) = C_0 \\frac{\\cosh(\\lambda(h-z)) + (k_s/D\\lambda) \\sinh(\\lambda(h-z))}{\\cosh(\\lambda h) + (k_s/D\\lambda) \\sinh(\\lambda h)}\n$$\nDefining a dimensionless parameter $\\beta = \\frac{k_s}{D\\lambda} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_s w}{2D}}$, the concentration profile is:\n$$\nC(z) = C_0 \\frac{\\cosh(\\lambda(h-z)) + \\beta \\sinh(\\lambda(h-z))}{\\cosh(\\lambda h) + \\beta \\sinh(\\lambda h)}\n$$\n\n**4. Sidewall Thickness Profile Calculation**\n\nThe local thickness growth rate, $R(z)$ in $\\mathrm{m/s}$, on the sidewalls is proportional to the molar flux of precursor reacting on the surface, $j_{\\mathrm{surf}}(z) = k_s C(z)$. The constant of proportionality is the molar volume, $V_m$, of the deposited silicon dioxide ($\\mathrm{SiO_2}$).\n$$\nR(z) = j_{\\mathrm{surf}}(z) \\cdot V_m = k_s C(z) V_m\n$$\nThe molar volume is calculated from the molar mass, $M_{\\mathrm{SiO_2}}$, and bulk density, $\\rho_{\\mathrm{SiO_2}}$:\n$$\nV_m = \\frac{M_{\\mathrm{SiO_2}}}{\\rho_{\\mathrm{SiO_2}}}\n$$\nThe total deposited thickness, $t(z)$, after a deposition time $\\tau$ is given by $t(z) = R(z) \\cdot \\tau$, assuming the growth rate is constant over time (i.e., the geometry change is negligible).\n$$\nt(z) = \\tau k_s V_m C(z)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C(z)$:\n$$\nt(z) = \\tau k_s V_m C_0 \\frac{\\cosh(\\lambda(h-z)) + \\beta \\sinh(\\lambda(h-z))}{\\cosh(\\lambda h) + \\beta \\sinh(\\lambda h)}\n$$\nThis formula is used to compute the thickness at the specified depths $z_i = i \\cdot h/10$ for $i=0, 1, \\dots, 10$. The final results are converted from meters to nanometers.\n\n**5. Numerical Calculation Procedure**\n\nFor each test case, the following steps are performed:\n1.  Use the given parameters: $w, h, D, k_s, C_0, \\tau$.\n2.  Calculate the molar volume $V_m$ from the provided constants for $\\mathrm{SiO_2}$ ($M_{\\mathrm{SiO_2}}=0.06008\\,\\mathrm{kg/mol}$, $\\rho_{\\mathrm{SiO_2}}=2200\\,\\mathrm{kg/m^3}$).\n3.  Calculate the derived model parameters $\\lambda = \\sqrt{2k_s/(wD)}$ and $\\beta = \\sqrt{k_s w/(2D)}$.\n4.  For each sampling point $z_i = i \\cdot h/10$ (where $i=0, 1, \\dots, 10$):\n    a. Evaluate the function $t(z_i)$ using the derived formula.\n    b. Convert the result from meters to nanometers by multiplying by $10^9$.\n5.  Collect the $11$ thickness values into a list for the test case.\n6.  The final output is a list containing the result lists for all test cases.",
