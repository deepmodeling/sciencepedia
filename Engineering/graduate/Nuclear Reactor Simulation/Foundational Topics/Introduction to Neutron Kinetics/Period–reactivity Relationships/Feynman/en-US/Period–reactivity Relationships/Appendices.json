            "problem": "You are given scientifically plausible delayed neutron data and a prompt neutron generation time for a homogeneous point reactor model. The task is to build a numerical procedure that, assuming constant reactivity, reliably inverts the period–reactivity relationship to obtain the reactor period $T$ as a function of specified reactivity $\\rho$ near criticality. The starting point is the point kinetics equations for neutron population $n(t)$ and delayed neutron precursor concentrations $C_i(t)$, together with the definition of reactor period and standard delayed neutron group data. You must not use any closed-form inversion; instead, construct an algorithm that solves the implicit mapping from $T$ to $\\rho$ by robust numerical root finding.\n\nFundamental base to use:\n- Point kinetics equations with constant reactivity and no external source:\n  - $\\dfrac{d n(t)}{d t} = \\dfrac{\\rho - \\beta}{\\Lambda} n(t) + \\sum_{i=1}^m \\lambda_i C_i(t)$\n  - $\\dfrac{d C_i(t)}{d t} = \\dfrac{\\beta_i}{\\Lambda} n(t) - \\lambda_i C_i(t)$\n- Assume exponential behavior of the neutron population $n(t) \\propto e^{\\omega t}$ defining growth rate $\\omega$ and reactor period $T$ via $\\omega = 1/T$.\n\nYour program must:\n1.

Select the physically relevant principal branch near criticality: as $\\rho \\to 0^+$, $T \\to +\\infty$; as $\\rho \\to 0^-$, $T \\to -\\infty$. Your solver must avoid singularities at $T = -1/\\lambda_i$ and must bracket the root on a monotonic interval separated from these poles.\n3. Handle the exact critical case $\\rho = 0$ by returning an infinite period.\n4. Express all returned periods in seconds, rounded to six decimal places.\n\nInput data for the test suite:\n- Use units of seconds for $T$ and $\\Lambda$, and seconds$^{-1}$ for $\\lambda_i$.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the well-established theory of nuclear reactor point kinetics, is mathematically well-posed, and is presented in an objective and unambiguous manner. All necessary data and constraints are provided to formulate and solve the problem numerically.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the inversion of the period-reactivity relationship, which is derived from the point kinetics equations for a reactor with constant reactivity $\\rho$ and no external source. The governing equations for the neutron population $n(t)$ and the concentration of the $i$-th group of delayed neutron precursors $C_i(t)$ are:\n$$\n\\frac{d n(t)}{d t} = \\frac{\\rho - \\beta}{\\Lambda} n(t) + \\sum_{i=1}^m \\lambda_i C_i(t)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d C_i(t)}{d t} = \\frac{\\beta_i}{\\Lambda} n(t) - \\lambda_i C_i(t)\n$$\nHere, $\\Lambda$ is the prompt neutron generation time, $\\beta_i$ is the delayed neutron fraction for group $i$, $\\beta = \\sum_{i=1}^m \\beta_i$ is the total delayed neutron fraction, $\\lambda_i$ is the decay constant for precursor group $i$, and $m$ is the number of delayed neutron groups.\n\nWhen the reactivity $\\rho$ is constant, the neutron population and precursor concentrations exhibit an asymptotic exponential behavior, $n(t) = n_0 e^{\\omega t}$ and $C_i(t) = C_{i0} e^{\\omega t}$, where $\\omega$ is the inverse reactor period, $\\omega = 1/T$. Substituting these forms into the precursor equation yields an algebraic relationship for the asymptotic state:\n$$\n\\omega C_{i0} e^{\\omega t} = \\frac{\\beta_i}{\\Lambda} n_0 e^{\\omega t} - \\lambda_i C_{i0} e^{\\omega t}\n$$\nSolving for $C_{i0}$ gives:\n$$\nC_{i0} = \\frac{\\beta_i n_0}{\\Lambda(\\omega + \\lambda_i)} \\quad \\implies \\quad C_i(t) = \\frac{\\beta_i n(t)}{\\Lambda(\\omega + \\lambda_i)}\n$$\nSubstituting this result along with $\\frac{d n(t)}{d t} = \\omega n(t)$ into the neutron population equation, we obtain:\n$$\n\\omega n(t) = \\frac{\\rho - \\beta}{\\Lambda} n(t) + \\sum_{i=1}^m \\lambda_i \\left( \\frac{\\beta_i n(t)}{\\Lambda(\\omega + \\lambda_i)} \\right)\n$$\nDividing by $n(t)$ and multiplying by $\\Lambda$ gives the well-known inhour equation relating reactivity to the inverse period $\\omega$:\n$$\n\\Lambda \\omega = \\rho - \\beta + \\sum_{i=1}^m \\frac{\\lambda_i \\beta_i}{\\omega + \\lambda_i}\n$$\nRearranging to express $\\rho$ as a function of $\\omega$ yields:\n$$\n\\rho(\\omega) = \\Lambda \\omega + \\sum_{i=1}^m \\beta_i - \\sum_{i=1}^m \\frac{\\lambda_i \\beta_i}{\\omega + \\lambda_i} = \\Lambda \\omega + \\sum_{i=1}^m \\frac{\\omega \\beta_i}{\\omega + \\lambda_i}\n$$\nThe problem is stated in terms of the reactor period $T$, so we substitute $\\omega = 1/T$:\n$$\n\\rho(T) = \\frac{\\Lambda}{T} + \\sum_{i=1}^m \\frac{\\beta_i / T}{1/T + \\lambda_i} = \\frac{\\Lambda}{T} + \\sum_{i=1}^m \\frac{\\beta_i}{1 + \\lambda_i T}\n$$\nOur task is to find the period $T$ that corresponds to a given target reactivity $\\rho_{target}$. This is a root-finding problem for the residual function $g(T)$:\n$$\ng(T) = \\rho(T) - \\rho_{target} = \\left( \\frac{\\Lambda}{T} + \\sum_{i=1}^m \\frac{\\beta_i}{1 + \\lambda_i T} \\right) - \\rho_{target} = 0\n$$\nWe will solve this equation numerically using a robust bracketing method, as required. The choice of the bracket depends on the sign of $\\rho_{target}$. The function $\\rho(T)$ has poles at $T_i = -1/\\lambda_i$ for each delayed neutron group. The principal branch of the solution, which is physically relevant for states near critical, is the one with the largest algebraic value of $T$.\n\nCase 1: Critical Reactor ($\\rho_{target} = 0$)\nWhen the reactivity is zero, the reactor is exactly critical. In the point kinetics model, this corresponds to a stable neutron population, which is equivalent to an infinite period. This can be seen from the equation for $\\rho(T)$, where $\\rho(T) \\to 0$ as $|T| \\to \\infty$. The algorithm will handle this as a special case and return an infinite period.\n\nCase 2: Supercritical Reactor ($\\rho_{target}  0$)\nFor positive reactivity, the neutron population grows, corresponding to a positive period $T  0$. In the interval $T \\in (0, \\infty)$, the function $\\rho(T)$ is continuous and monotonically decreases from $\\rho(T) \\to +\\infty$ as $T \\to 0^+$ to $\\rho(T) \\to 0$ as $T \\to +\\infty$. Therefore, for any $\\rho_{target}  0$, a unique positive root $T$ exists. We can establish a search bracket $[a, b]$ where $a$ is a small positive number (e.g., $10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{s}$) and $b$ is a large positive number (e.g., $10^9\\ \\mathrm{s}$). For such a bracket, $g(a) = \\rho(a) - \\rho_{target}  0$ and $g(b) = \\rho(b) - \\rho_{target}  0$, guaranteeing a root within the interval.\n\nCase 3: Subcritical Reactor ($\\rho_{target}  0$)\nFor negative reactivity, the neutron population decays, corresponding to a negative period $T  0$. The principal root for $T$ lies in the interval $(-\\infty, -1/\\lambda_{min})$, where $\\lambda_{min}$ is the smallest of all decay constants $\\lambda_i$. In this interval, $\\rho(T)$ is continuous and monotonically decreases from $\\rho(T) \\to 0$ as $T \\to -\\infty$ to $\\rho(T) \\to -\\infty$ as $T$ approaches the pole at $-1/\\lambda_{min}$ from below. For any $\\rho_{target}  0$, a unique root exists in this interval. A suitable search bracket $[a, b]$ can be constructed where $a$ is a large-magnitude negative number (e.g., $-10^9\\ \\mathrm{s}$) and $b$ is a value slightly smaller than the first pole (e.g., $-1/\\lambda_{min} - 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{s}$). For this bracket, $g(a) \\approx -\\rho_{target}  0$ and $g(b)$ is a large negative value, so $g(b)  0$, which again guarantees a root.\n\nThe implementation will use the `scipy.optimize.brentq` function, a highly efficient and robust bracketing-based root-finder. It combines bisection, secant, and inverse quadratic interpolation methods to find a root, satisfying the problem's algorithmic constraints. The procedure will first determine the appropriate bracket based on the sign of $\\rho_{target}$ and then invoke `brentq` to find the period $T$. Results will be formatted to six decimal places as required.",

Immediately after a step reactivity insertion at time $t=0$, a measured prompt jump factor $J$ is obtained as the ratio of reactor power just after the insertion to just before. Subsequently, after the delayed-neutron transient has settled, the reactor exhibits an exponential power evolution with a measured asymptotic reactor period $T$ (in seconds), so that the power $P(t)$ behaves as $P(t) \\propto \\exp(\\omega t)$ with $\\omega = 1/T$.

Inference of Reactivity from the Prompt Jump ($ \\Delta \\rho_{\\text{jump}} $)**\n\nThe prompt jump is the rapid change in neutron population immediately following the reactivity insertion. This change occurs on a timescale governed by $\\Lambda$, which is much shorter than the timescales of precursor decay, $1/\\lambda_i$. Consequently, the precursor concentrations $C_i(t)$ do not change instantaneously: $C_i(0^+) = C_i(0^-)$.\n\nFor the initial critical state at $t=0^-$, we have $\\frac{dn}{dt}=0$, $\\rho=0$, and $n(t) = n_0$. The PKE for neutron population becomes:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{0 - \\beta_{\\text{eff}}}{\\Lambda} n_0 + \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\lambda_i C_i(0^-)\n$$\nThis implies that the initial source of delayed neutrons is $\\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\lambda_i C_i(0^-) = \\frac{\\beta_{\\text{eff}}}{\\Lambda} n_0$.\n\nImmediately after the step insertion at $t=0^+$, the reactivity is $\\Delta\\rho$, the neutron population is $n(0^+)$, and the delayed neutron source term is unchanged, $\\sum \\lambda_i C_i(0^+) = \\sum \\lambda_i C_i(0^-) = \\frac{\\beta_{\\text{eff}}}{\\Lambda} n_0$.

No flaws are detected. The solution process may proceed.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem requires the derivation of the period-reactivity relationship, the formulation of its uncertainty, and a numerical evaluation.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Period–Reactivity Relationship**\n\nThe point kinetics equations for the neutron population $n(t)$ and the concentration of the $i$-th group of delayed neutron precursors $C_i(t)$ are:\n$$\n\\frac{dn(t)}{dt} = \\frac{\\rho - \\beta}{\\Lambda} n(t) + \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\lambda_i C_i(t)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dC_i(t)}{dt} = \\frac{\\beta_i}{\\Lambda} n(t) - \\lambda_i C_i(t), \\quad i = 1, \\dots, m\n$$\nwhere $\\beta = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\beta_i$ is the total delayed neutron fraction.\n\nThe problem states that the reactor is on a stable exponential period $T$, so the neutron population and precursor concentrations have the form:\n$$\nn(t) = n_0 \\exp(st), \\quad C_i(t) = C_{i0} \\exp(st)\n$$\nwhere $s = 1/T$ is the inverse period. The time derivatives are $\\frac{dn}{dt} = sn(t)$ and $\\frac{dC_i}{dt} = sC_i(t)$.\n\nSubstituting these forms into the precursor equation yields:\n$$\nsC_i(t) = \\frac{\\beta_i}{\\Lambda} n(t) - \\lambda_i C_i(t)\n$$\n$$\n(s + \\lambda_i) C_i(t) = \\frac{\\beta_i}{\\Lambda} n(t) \\implies C_i(t) = \\frac{\\beta_i}{\\Lambda(s + \\lambda_i)} n(t)\n$$\nNext, substitute the derivative $\\frac{dn}{dt}$ and the expression for $C_i(t)$ into the neutron balance equation:\n$$\nsn(t) = \\frac{\\rho - \\beta}{\\Lambda} n(t) + \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\lambda_i \\left( \\frac{\\beta_i}{\\Lambda(s + \\lambda_i)} n(t) \\right)\n$$\nDividing by $n(t)$ (which is non-zero) and multiplying by $\\Lambda$:\n$$\ns\\Lambda = \\rho - \\beta + \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\frac{\\lambda_i \\beta_i}{s + \\lambda_i}\n$$\nSolving for the reactivity $\\rho$:\n$$\n\\rho = s\\Lambda + \\beta - \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\frac{\\lambda_i \\beta_i}{s + \\lambda_i}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\beta = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\beta_i$ and combining the sums:\n$$\n\\rho = s\\Lambda + \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\left( \\beta_i - \\frac{\\lambda_i \\beta_i}{s + \\lambda_i} \\right) = s\\Lambda + \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\beta_i \\left( \\frac{s + \\lambda_i - \\lambda_i}{s + \\lambda_i} \\right)\n$$\nThis simplifies to the standard in-hour equation, which is the required period-reactivity relationship:\n$$\n\\rho(s, \\Lambda, \\{\\beta_i\\}, \\{\\lambda_i\\}) = s\\Lambda + \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\frac{s \\beta_i}{s + \\lambda_i}\n$$\n\n**2.

The measurement of the period $T$ provides a fixed value for $s=1/T$. The problem states that the uncertainties in the kinetic parameters are mutually independent. Under this assumption, the variance of $\\rho$, denoted $\\sigma_\\rho^2$, can be calculated using the first-order linear uncertainty propagation formula:\n$$\n\\sigma_\\rho^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial \\Lambda}\\right)^2 \\sigma_\\Lambda^2 + \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial \\beta_i}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{\\beta_i}^2 + \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial \\lambda_i}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{\\lambda_i}^2\n$$\nThe required partial derivatives (sensitivities) are:\n-   With respect to $\\Lambda$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial \\Lambda} = s\n    $$\n-   With respect to $\\beta_i$ for a specific group $i$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial \\beta_i} = \\frac{s}{s + \\lambda_i}\n    $$\n-   With respect to $\\lambda_i$ for a specific group $i$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial \\rho}{\\partial \\lambda_i} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\lambda_i} \\left( \\frac{s \\beta_i}{s + \\lambda_i} \\right) = s \\beta_i (-1)(s + \\lambda_i)^{-2} = -\\frac{s \\beta_i}{(s + \\lambda_i)^2}\n    $$\nSubstituting these derivatives into the variance formula gives the closed-form expression:\n$$\n\\sigma_\\rho^2 = s^2 \\sigma_\\Lambda^2 + \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\left(\\frac{s}{s + \\lambda_i}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{\\beta_i}^2 + \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\left(-\\frac{s \\beta_i}{(s + \\lambda_i)^2}\\right)^2 \\sigma_{\\lambda_i}^2\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_\\rho^2 = s^2 \\sigma_\\Lambda^2 + s^2 \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\frac{\\sigma_{\\beta_i}^2}{(s + \\lambda_i)^2} + s^2 \\sum_{i=1}^{m} \\frac{\\beta_i^2 \\sigma_{\\lambda_i}^2}{(s + \\lambda_i)^4}\n$$\n\n**3. Numerical Evaluation**\n\nThe problem provides $T = 20\\,\\text{s}$, so the inverse period is $s = 1/20\\,\\text{s}^{-1} = 0.05\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$.

Interpretation of Dominant Uncertainty Contributors**\n\nTo understand which parameters dominate the uncertainty in the inferred reactivity $\\rho$, we compare the magnitudes of their contributions to the total variance $\\sigma_\\rho^2 \\approx 9.31 \\times 10^{-10}$:\n-   Contribution from $\\Lambda$: $V_\\Lambda = 2.5 \\times 10^{-13}$ ($\\approx 0.03\\%$).\n-   Contribution from $\\{\\beta_i\\}$: $V_\\beta = 8.29 \\times 10^{-10}$ ($\\approx 89.0\\%$).\n-   Contribution from $\\{\\lambda_i\\}$: $V_\\lambda = 1.02 \\times 10^{-10}$ ($\\approx 10.9\\%$).\n\nThe analysis clearly shows that the uncertainty in the inferred reactivity $\\rho$ is overwhelmingly dominated by the uncertainties in the delayed neutron fractions, $\\{\\beta_i\\}$. The uncertainties in the decay constants, $\\{\\lambda_i\\}$, contribute significantly less, and the contribution from the prompt neutron generation time, $\\Lambda$, is negligible. The reasons are rooted in the sensitivities and magnitudes of the terms in the in-hour equation for the given long period ($T=20\\,\\text{s}$).\n\n1.  **Dominance of $\\beta_i$ Uncertainties**: For a long period, $s = 0.05\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$ is small. The reactivity is dominated by the delayed neutron term, $\\rho \\approx \\sum_i \\frac{s \\beta_i}{s + \\lambda_i}$. This term is linearly proportional to $\\beta_i$. The sensitivity, $\\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial\\beta_i} = \\frac{s}{s+\\lambda_i}$, is of order unity for the longer-lived precursor groups (small $\\lambda_i$). Consequently, the $3\\%$ relative uncertainty in $\\beta_i$ propagates almost directly to a significant uncertainty in $\\rho$.\n\n2.  **Lesser Impact of $\\lambda_i$ Uncertainties**: The sensitivity of $\\rho$ to $\\lambda_i$ is $\\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial\\lambda_i} = -\\frac{s \\beta_i}{(s+\\lambda_i)^2}$. Compared to the sensitivity to $\\beta_i$, this contains an additional factor of $-\\frac{\\lambda_i}{s+\\lambda_i}$. Since this factor's magnitude is always less than $1$, the sensitivity to $\\lambda_i$ is inherently smaller than to $\\beta_i$. This physical suppression of sensitivity, combined with a slightly smaller relative uncertainty ($2\\%$ for $\\lambda_i$ vs. $3\\%$ for $\\beta_i$), results in a much smaller contribution to the total variance.\n\n3.  **Negligible Impact of $\\Lambda$ Uncertainty**: The contribution of the prompt neutron lifetime is through the term $s\\Lambda$. For a long period, $s$ is small, making the prompt term $s\\Lambda = (0.05)(5 \\times 10^{-5}) = 2.5 \\times 10^{-6}$ a tiny fraction of the total reactivity $\\rho \\approx 1.76 \\times 10^{-3}$. The sensitivity $\\frac{\\partial\\rho}{\\partial\\Lambda} = s$ is small, and thus even a large relative uncertainty in $\\Lambda$ ($20\\%$ in this case) translates into a minuscule absolute uncertainty in $\\rho$.\n\nIn summary, for reactivity measurements based on long reactor periods, the accuracy is primarily limited by the accuracy of the nuclear data for delayed neutron fractions.",
