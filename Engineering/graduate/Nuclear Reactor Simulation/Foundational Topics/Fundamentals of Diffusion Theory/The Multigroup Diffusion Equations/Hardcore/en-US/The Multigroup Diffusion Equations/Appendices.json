This first exercise challenges you to derive the fundamental relationship between a reactor's material properties, its geometry (represented by the buckling $B^2$), and its effective multiplication factor ($k_{\\text{eff}}$). By working through this classic problem for a simple two-group model, you will solidify your understanding of how the interplay between neutron production, absorption, and leakage determines whether a reactor is subcritical, critical, or supercritical.

This is the total length of the vector $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}$. Since there are $G$ energy groups and $N$ spatial unknowns per group, the total number of unknowns is the product:\n$$\nU = G N\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the structure of the global coefficient matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ and count its total number of nonzero entries, $Z$. The matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ has dimensions $(GN) \\times (GN)$.

We analyze the diagonal and off-diagonal blocks separately.\n\nThe diagonal blocks, $\\mathbf{A}_{gg}$ for $g \\in \\{1,\\dots,G\\}$, represent the intra-group coupling for group $g$. This coupling arises from the spatial discretization of the diffusion term, $-\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x}(D_{g}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\phi_{g}}{\\mathrm{d}x})$, and the removal term, $\\Sigma_{r,g}\\phi_{g}$. The problem specifies a second-order centered finite difference scheme. For an interior cell $i \\in \\{2, \\dots, N-1\\}$, this scheme creates a three-point stencil, coupling $\\phi_{g,i}$ with its neighbors $\\phi_{g,i-1}$ and $\\phi_{g,i+1}$. This results in $3$ nonzero entries in the $i$-th row of the block $\\mathbf{A}_{gg}$. For the boundary cells $i=1$ and $i=N$, the Dirichlet boundary conditions imply that flux values at the domain ends are known and moved to the right-hand side of the linear system. Consequently, the stencil for cell $1$ couples only $\\phi_{g,1}$ and $\\phi_{g,2}$, and for cell $N$ couples only $\\phi_{g,N-1}$ and $\\phi_{g,N}$. This results in $2$ nonzero entries in each of the first and last rows of $\\mathbf{A}_{gg}$. Thus, each diagonal block $\\mathbf{A}_{gg}$ is an $N \\times N$ tridiagonal matrix. The number of nonzeros in one such block is $(N-2) \\times 3 + 2 \\times 2 = 3N - 6 + 4 = 3N - 2$. This formula holds for $N \\geq 1$. Since there are $G$ such diagonal blocks, their total contribution to $Z$ is $G(3N - 2)$.\n\nThe off-diagonal blocks, $\\mathbf{A}_{g,g'}$ for $g \\neq g'$, represent the inter-group coupling, which stems from the scattering term $\\sum_{g' \\neq g} \\Sigma_{s,g'\\rightarrow g}\\phi_{g'}$. The problem states that this coupling is \"spatially local,\" meaning $\\phi_{g,i}$ is coupled only to $\\phi_{g',i}$ at the same cell $i$. This implies that the blocks $\\mathbf{A}_{g,g'}$ are diagonal matrices. The problem also specifies that all inter-group scattering cross sections $\\Sigma_{s,g'\\rightarrow g}$ are nonzero for $g' \\neq g$. Thus, each of the $N$ diagonal entries of $\\mathbf{A}_{g,g'}$ is nonzero. The number of nonzeros in each off-diagonal block is exactly $N$. There are $G^2 - G = G(G-1)$ such off-diagonal blocks. Their total contribution to $Z$ is $G(G-1)N$.\n\nThe total number of nonzero entries, $Z$, is the sum of contributions from all diagonal and off-diagonal blocks:\n$$\nZ = (\\text{Nonzeros from diagonal blocks}) + (\\text{Nonzeros from off-diagonal blocks})\n$$\n$$\nZ = G(3N - 2) + G(G-1)N\n$$\nExpanding and simplifying this expression gives:\n$$\nZ = 3GN - 2G + G^2N - GN = G^2N + 2GN - 2G\n$$\nThe result can also be expressed in factored form as $Z = G(GN + 2N - 2)$.\n\nThe required quantities are the total number of unknowns, $U = GN$, and the total number of nonzero entries, $Z = G^2N + 2GN - 2G$.",

Substituting this into the diffusion equations eliminates the spatial dependence, resulting in a system of algebraic equations for the flux amplitudes $\\Phi_1$ and $\\Phi_2$:\n\n$$ D_1 B^2 \\Phi_1 + \\Sigma_{r1}\\Phi_1 = \\Sigma_{s21}\\Phi_2 + \\frac{\\chi_1}{k}(f_1 \\Phi_1 + f_2 \\Phi_2) $$\n$$ D_2 B^2 \\Phi_2 + \\Sigma_{r2}\\Phi_2 = \\Sigma_{s12}\\Phi_1 + \\frac{\\chi_2}{k}(f_1 \\Phi_1 + f_2 \\Phi_2) $$\nFor clarity, we drop the subscript $n$ from the buckling $B^2$ for the moment. To find a non-trivial solution for $(\\Phi_1, \\Phi_2)$, we rearrange the system into a homogeneous matrix equation:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} D_1 B^2 + \\Sigma_{r1} - \\frac{\\chi_1 f_1}{k}  -(\\Sigma_{s21} + \\frac{\\chi_1 f_2}{k}) \\\\ -(\\Sigma_{s12} + \\frac{\\chi_2 f_1}{k})  D_2 B^2 + \\Sigma_{r2} - \\frac{\\chi_2 f_2}{k} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\Phi_1 \\\\ \\Phi_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nA non-trivial solution exists if and only if the determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero.\n$$ (D_1 B^2 + \\Sigma_{r1} - \\frac{\\chi_1 f_1}{k})(D_2 B^2 + \\Sigma_{r2} - \\frac{\\chi_2 f_2}{k}) - (\\Sigma_{s21} + \\frac{\\chi_1 f_2}{k})(\\Sigma_{s12} + \\frac{\\chi_2 f_1}{k}) = 0 $$\nExpanding this determinant equation:\n$$ \\left[(D_1 B^2 + \\Sigma_{r1})(D_2 B^2 + \\Sigma_{r2}) - \\frac{\\chi_2 f_2}{k}(D_1 B^2 + \\Sigma_{r1}) - \\frac{\\chi_1 f_1}{k}(D_2 B^2 + \\Sigma_{r2}) + \\frac{\\chi_1 \\chi_2 f_1 f_2}{k^2}\\right] - \\left[\\Sigma_{s12}\\Sigma_{s21} + \\frac{\\chi_2 f_1 \\Sigma_{s21}}{k} + \\frac{\\chi_1 f_2 \\Sigma_{s12}}{k} + \\frac{\\chi_1 \\chi_2 f_1 f_2}{k^2}\\right] = 0 $$\nThe terms proportional to $1/k^2$ cancel. We can then solve for $k$ by isolating the terms proportional to $1/k$:\n$$ (D_1 B^2 + \\Sigma_{r1})(D_2 B^2 + \\Sigma_{r2}) - \\Sigma_{s12}\\Sigma_{s21} = \\frac{1}{k} \\left[ \\chi_1 f_1 (D_2 B^2 + \\Sigma_{r2}) + \\chi_2 f_2 (D_1 B^2 + \\Sigma_{r1}) + \\chi_1 f_2 \\Sigma_{s12} + \\chi_2 f_1 \\Sigma_{s21} \\right] $$\nThis gives the dispersion relation, which expresses the eigenvalue $k$ as a function of the buckling $B^2$:\n$$ k(B^2) = \\frac{\\chi_1 f_1 (D_2 B^2 + \\Sigma_{r2}) + \\chi_2 f_2 (D_1 B^2 + \\Sigma_{r1}) + \\chi_1 f_2 \\Sigma_{s12} + \\chi_2 f_1 \\Sigma_{s21}}{(D_1 B^2 + \\Sigma_{r1})(D_2 B^2 + \\Sigma_{r2}) - \\Sigma_{s12}\\Sigma_{s21}} $$\nThe fundamental mode corresponds to $n=1$, with buckling $B_1^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2$. The first harmonic mode corresponds to $n=2$, with buckling $B_2^2 = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{L}\\right)^2 = 4\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{L}\\right)^2$.\n\nThe corresponding eigenvalues are $k_1 = k(B_1^2)$ and $k_2 = k(B_2^2)$. The dominance ratio $\\rho$ is defined as the ratio of the first harmonic eigenvalue to the fundamental eigenvalue, $\\rho = k_2/k_1$. This ratio controls the convergence rate of power iteration methods used to solve the eigenvalue problem numerically; a smaller $\\rho$ leads to faster convergence.\n\nUsing the derived dispersion relation, we have:\n$$ k_1 = k(B_1^2) = \\frac{\\chi_1 f_1 (D_2 B_1^2 + \\Sigma_{r2}) + \\chi_2 f_2 (D_1 B_1^2 + \\Sigma_{r1}) + \\chi_1 f_2 \\Sigma_{s12} + \\chi_2 f_1 \\Sigma_{s21}}{(D_1 B_1^2 + \\Sigma_{r1})(D_2 B_1^2 + \\Sigma_{r2}) - \\Sigma_{s12}\\Sigma_{s21}} $$\n$$ k_2 = k(B_2^2) = \\frac{\\chi_1 f_1 (D_2 B_2^2 + \\Sigma_{r2}) + \\chi_2 f_2 (D_1 B_2^2 + \\Sigma_{r1}) + \\chi_1 f_2 \\Sigma_{s12} + \\chi_2 f_1 \\Sigma_{s21}}{(D_1 B_2^2 + \\Sigma_{r1})(D_2 B_2^2 + \\Sigma_{r2}) - \\Sigma_{s12}\\Sigma_{s21}} $$\nThe dominance ratio is therefore:\n$$ \\rho = \\frac{k_2}{k_1} = \\frac{k(B_2^2)}{k(B_1^2)} = \\frac{\\text{Numerator}(k(B_2^2))}{\\text{Denominator}(k(B_2^2))} \\times \\frac{\\text{Denominator}(k(B_1^2))}{\\text{Numerator}(k(B_1^2))} $$\nSubstituting $B_1^2 = (\\pi/L)^2$ and $B_2^2 = 4(\\pi/L)^2$ yields the final expression for $\\rho$.",
