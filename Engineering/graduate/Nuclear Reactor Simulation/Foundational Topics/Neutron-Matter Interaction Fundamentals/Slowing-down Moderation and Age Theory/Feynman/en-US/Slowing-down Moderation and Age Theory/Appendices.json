These are standard and well-established principles. The data for hydrogen and graphite are realistic.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined with all necessary parameters and constants provided. The assumptions, such as constant cross sections and CSDA, render the problem analytically solvable and ensure a unique solution.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, technical language, free from any subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A detailed solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Fermi Age Formula**\n\nThe Fermi age, $\\tau$, is a parameter with units of area ($L^2$) that characterizes the mean square distance a neutron travels from its point of origin as a point source while slowing down from an initial energy $E_0$ to a final energy $E$. It is formally defined through the age-diffusion equation. The relationship between age $\\tau$ and lethargy $u$ is given by the differential expression:\n$$ d\\tau = \\frac{D(u)}{\\xi \\Sigma_s(u)} du $$\nwhere $D(u)$ is the energy-dependent diffusion coefficient, $\\xi$ is the average logarithmic energy decrement, and $\\Sigma_s(u)$ is the macroscopic scattering cross section. The total age for slowing down from lethargy $0$ (energy $E_0$) to lethargy $u$ (energy $E$) is obtained by integrating this expression:\n$$ \\tau(u) = \\int_0^u \\frac{D(u')}{\\xi \\Sigma_s(u')} du' $$\nThis definition is a cornerstone result derived from the fundamental principles of random-flight diffusion and neutron slowing down.\n\nThe problem provides the specific forms for the quantities in the integrand:\n1. The diffusion coefficient is given as $D = \\frac{1}{3 \\Sigma_{tr}}$.\n2. The problem assumes the medium is scattering-dominated and scattering is nearly isotropic, such that the scattering cross section is approximately equal to the transport cross section: $\\Sigma_s \\approx \\Sigma_{tr}$.\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the integral for $\\tau(u)$:\n$$ \\tau(u) = \\int_0^u \\frac{1/(3 \\Sigma_{tr}(u'))}{\\xi \\Sigma_s(u')} du' $$\nApplying the approximation $\\Sigma_s(u') \\approx \\Sigma_{tr}(u')$ yields:\n$$ \\tau(u) \\approx \\int_0^u \\frac{1}{3 \\xi \\Sigma_{tr}(u')^2} du' $$\nThis is the general expression for the Fermi age under the stated assumptions. The problem further simplifies the context by stating that the material properties ($\\xi$ and $\\Sigma_{tr}$) can be taken as constants over the slowing-down interval. With $\\xi$ and $\\Sigma_{tr}$ being constant, they can be moved outside the integral:\n$$ \\tau(u) = \\frac{1}{3 \\xi \\Sigma_{tr}^2} \\int_0^u du' $$\nPerforming the simple integration gives the final derived expression for Fermi age for a a total lethargy change of $u$:\n$$ \\tau(u) = \\frac{u}{3 \\xi \\Sigma_{tr}^2} $$\n\n**Calculation of the Ratio of Fermi Ages**\n\nFirst, we must calculate the total lethargy change, $u$, for neutrons slowing down from $E_0 = 2.0$ MeV to $E = 0.10$ eV.\nThe initial energy is $E_0 = 2.0 \\text{ MeV} = 2.0 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}$.\nThe final energy is $E = 0.10 \\text{ eV}$.\nThe lethargy change is:\n$$ u = \\ln\\left(\\frac{E_0}{E}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{2.0 \\times 10^6 \\text{ eV}}{0.10 \\text{ eV}}\\right) = \\ln(2.0 \\times 10^7) $$\nNumerically, $u \\approx 16.8112$.\n\nUsing the derived formula, the Fermi age for hydrogen ($\\mathrm{H}$) is:\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{H}} = \\frac{u}{3 \\xi_{\\mathrm{H}} \\Sigma_{tr,\\mathrm{H}}^2} $$\nAnd for graphite ($\\mathrm{Gr}$):\n$$ \\tau_{\\mathrm{Gr}} = \\frac{u}{3 \\xi_{\\mathrm{Gr}} \\Sigma_{tr,\\mathrm{Gr}}^2} $$\n\nThe ratio $\\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{Gr}}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{H}}}$ is then:\n$$ \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{Gr}}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{H}}} = \\frac{u / (3 \\xi_{\\mathrm{Gr}} \\Sigma_{tr,\\mathrm{Gr}}^2)}{u / (3 \\xi_{\\mathrm{H}} \\Sigma_{tr,\\mathrm{H}}^2)} $$\nThe terms $u$ and $3$ cancel, yielding an expression that is independent of the specific energy range:\n$$ \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{Gr}}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{H}}} = \\frac{\\xi_{\\mathrm{H}} \\Sigma_{tr,\\mathrm{H}}^2}{\\xi_{\\mathrm{Gr}} \\Sigma_{tr,\\mathrm{Gr}}^2} $$\n\nNow, substitute the given material properties:\n- $\\xi_{\\mathrm{H}} = 1.000$\n- $\\Sigma_{tr,\\mathrm{H}} = 1.00 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$\n- $\\xi_{\\mathrm{Gr}} = 0.158$\n- $\\Sigma_{tr,\\mathrm{Gr}} = 0.35 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$\n\n$$ \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{Gr}}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{H}}} = \\frac{(1.000) \\times (1.00 \\text{ cm}^{-1})^2}{(0.158) \\times (0.35 \\text{ cm}^{-1})^2} = \\frac{1.000}{0.158 \\times 0.1225} = \\frac{1.000}{0.019355} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{Gr}}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{H}}} \\approx 51.666236 $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $51.67$.\n\n**Physical Explanation**\n\nThe Fermi age $\\tau$ is one-sixth of the mean square distance a neutron travels from its source point while slowing down. The significantly larger Fermi age in graphite compared to hydrogen ($\\tau_{\\mathrm{Gr}} \\gg \\tau_{\\mathrm{H}}$) can be explained by examining the two physical factors that determine its value, as seen in the formula $\\tau \\propto \\frac{1}{\\xi \\Sigma_{tr}^2}$:\n\n1.  **Slowing-Down Power per Collision ($\\xi$)**: The average logarithmic energy decrement, $\\xi$, measures how efficiently a moderator removes energy from a neutron in a single collision. For hydrogen, $\\xi_{\\mathrm{H}} = 1.000$, which is the maximum possible value. This is because the proton mass is nearly equal to the neutron mass, allowing for a large energy transfer. For graphite (carbon-12), $\\xi_{\\mathrm{Gr}} = 0.158$, which is much smaller. Consequently, it takes far more scattering collisions in graphite to slow a neutron down over the same energy range compared to hydrogen. The number of collisions is inversely proportional to $\\xi$ ($N \\propto 1/\\xi$).\n\n2.  **Distance Between Collisions ($\\ell_{tr}$)**: The transport mean free path, $\\ell_{tr} = 1/\\Sigma_{tr}$, is the average distance a neutron travels before an effectively randomizing scatter occurs. For hydrogen, $\\ell_{tr,\\mathrm{H}} = 1/(1.00 \\text{ cm}^{-1}) = 1.00$ cm. For graphite, $\\ell_{tr,\\mathrm{Gr}} = 1/(0.35 \\text{ cm}^{-1}) \\approx 2.86$ cm. Neutrons travel, on average, a much greater distance between collisions in graphite than in hydrogen.\n\nThe Fermi age can be thought of as being proportional to the product of the number of steps in a random walk and the square of the step length. In this analogy, the number of steps is the number of collisions ($N \\propto 1/\\xi$) and the step length is the transport mean free path ($\\ell_{tr} = 1/\\Sigma_{tr}$).\nThus, $\\tau \\propto N \\ell_{tr}^2 \\propto \\frac{1}{\\xi} \\left(\\frac{1}{\\Sigma_{tr}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{\\xi \\Sigma_{tr}^2}$.\n\nGraphite is a much less effective moderator per collision (small $\\xi$), requiring more scattering events. During this larger number of collisions, the neutron also travels a greater distance between each collision (large $\\ell_{tr}$). Both of these effects compound to make the neutron wander much farther from its origin in graphite before thermalizing, resulting in a substantially larger Fermi age.",

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. The provided parameters are physically plausible. The task is to apply standard homogenization techniques to a known physical equation. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe one-dimensional governing equation for the neutron density $n(x,u)$ is given by:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial u} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( K(x,u) \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x} \\right) $$\nwhere we have defined the coefficient $K(x,u) = \\frac{D(x,u)}{\\xi(x,u)}$. The neutron current in the lethargy-space formalism is $j(x,u) = -K(x,u) \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x}$. The medium is periodic in the $x$-direction with period $H = L_1 + L_2$. Within a single period, $K(x,u)$ is piecewise constant:\n$$ K(x,u) = \\begin{cases} K_1(u) = D_1(u)/\\xi_1(u) & \\text{for } x \\in \\text{Region 1} \\\\ K_2(u) = D_2(u)/\\xi_2(u) & \\text{for } x \\in \\text{Region 2} \\end{cases} $$\nWe are interested in the limit where the coarse-grained neutron density, $\\bar{n}(x,u)$, varies on a spatial scale much larger than the heterogeneity period $H$. In this limit, on the scale of a single period, the system can be considered to be in a quasi-steady state. The governing equation can be written as $\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial u} = -\\frac{\\partial j}{\\partial x}$. For a slowly varying macroscopic field, the change in neutron density with lethargy, $\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial u}$, is nearly constant over a single cell. This implies that $\\frac{\\partial j}{\\partial x}$ is also nearly constant. However, for a homogenization procedure, the correct local approximation is that the current $j(x,u)$ itself is constant with respect to $x$ across a single cell. This is because any net source or sink term $\\frac{\\partial j}{\\partial x}$ over the cell is accounted for by the macroscopic $\\frac{\\partial \\bar{n}}{\\partial u}$ term.\nThus, we set $\\frac{\\partial j}{\\partial x} = 0$ within a cell, which implies that the current $j(x,u)$ is constant in $x$. Let us denote this cell-constant current by $J(u)$.\n$$ j(x,u) = -K(x,u) \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x} = J(u) $$\nFrom this, we can express the local gradient of the neutron density:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{J(u)}{K(x,u)} $$\nThe change in neutron density across one full period $H$ is found by integrating this gradient from an arbitrary starting point $x_0$ to $x_0+H$:\n$$ \\Delta n = n(x_0+H, u) - n(x_0, u) = \\int_{x_0}^{x_0+H} \\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial x'} dx' = \\int_{x_0}^{x_0+H} \\left(-\\frac{J(u)}{K(x',u)}\\right) dx' $$\nSince $J(u)$ is constant in $x$, and the integral of $1/K(x,u)$ over one period is independent of the starting point $x_0$, we have:\n$$ \\Delta n = -J(u) \\left( \\int_{0}^{L_1} \\frac{1}{K_1(u)} dx' + \\int_{L_1}^{L_1+L_2} \\frac{1}{K_2(u)} dx' \\right) = -J(u) \\left( \\frac{L_1}{K_1(u)} + \\frac{L_2}{K_2(u)} \\right) $$\nThe homogenized or effective medium is described by the equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\bar{n}}{\\partial u} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( K_{\\text{eff}}(u) \\frac{\\partial \\bar{n}}{\\partial x} \\right) $$\nThis implies an effective current $\\bar{j}(u) = -K_{\\text{eff}}(u) \\frac{\\partial \\bar{n}}{\\partial x}$. For consistency, the effective current $\\bar{j}(u)$ must be the average current over the cell, and the effective gradient $\\frac{\\partial \\bar{n}}{\\partial x}$ must be the average gradient.\nThe average current is:\n$$ \\bar{j}(u) = \\frac{1}{H} \\int_{0}^{H} j(x,u) dx = \\frac{1}{H} \\int_{0}^{H} J(u) dx = J(u) $$\nThe average gradient is approximated by the total change in density across the cell divided by the cell width:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\bar{n}}{\\partial x} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta n}{H} = \\frac{n(x_0+H, u) - n(x_0, u)}{H} = -\\frac{J(u)}{H} \\left( \\frac{L_1}{K_1(u)} + \\frac{L_2}{K_2(u)} \\right) $$\nSubstituting these expressions into the effective constitutive relation $\\bar{j}(u) = -K_{\\text{eff}}(u) \\frac{\\partial \\bar{n}}{\\partial x}$:\n$$ J(u) = -K_{\\text{eff}}(u) \\left[ -\\frac{J(u)}{H} \\left( \\frac{L_1}{K_1(u)} + \\frac{L_2}{K_2(u)} \\right) \\right] $$\nAssuming a non-zero current ($J(u) \\neq 0$), we can divide by $J(u)$:\n$$ 1 = \\frac{K_{\\text{eff}}(u)}{H} \\left( \\frac{L_1}{K_1(u)} + \\frac{L_2}{K_2(u)} \\right) $$\nSolving for $K_{\\text{eff}}(u)$ gives the harmonic mean of $K(x,u)$:\n$$ K_{\\text{eff}}(u) = \\frac{H}{\\frac{L_1}{K_1(u)} + \\frac{L_2}{K_2(u)}} = \\frac{L_1 + L_2}{\\frac{L_1 \\xi_1(u)}{D_1(u)} + \\frac{L_2 \\xi_2(u)}{D_2(u)}} $$\nThis expression represents the effective coefficient for transport perpendicular to the layers.\n\nNext, we calculate the effective age, $\\tau_{\\text{eff}}(E)$. The problem states that the parameters $D_1$, $D_2$, $\\xi_1$, and $\\xi_2$ are independent of lethargy. Consequently, $K_1$, $K_2$, and $K_{\\text{eff}}$ are also constant with respect to $u$. The integral for the effective age simplifies significantly:\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{eff}}(E) = \\int_{0}^{u(E)} K_{\\text{eff}}(u')\\,\\mathrm{d}u' = K_{\\text{eff}} \\int_{0}^{u(E)} \\mathrm{d}u' = K_{\\text{eff}} \\cdot u(E) $$\nThe lethargy $u(E)$ is given by $u(E) = \\ln(E_{\\text{in}}/E)$. We are given $E_{\\text{in}} = 2.0\\,\\text{MeV} = 2.0 \\times 10^6\\,\\text{eV}$ and $E = 0.10\\,\\text{eV}$.\n$$ u(E) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{2.0 \\times 10^6\\,\\text{eV}}{0.10\\,\\text{eV}}\\right) = \\ln(2.0 \\times 10^7) $$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values for the parameters into the expression for $K_{\\text{eff}}$. All lengths are in cm and diffusivities in cm$^2$, so the units are consistent.\n$$ L_1 = 2.0\\,\\text{cm}, \\quad D_1 = 0.40\\,\\text{cm}^2, \\quad \\xi_1 = 0.925 $$\n$$ L_2 = 3.0\\,\\text{cm}, \\quad D_2 = 0.30\\,\\text{cm}^2, \\quad \\xi_2 = 0.12 $$\n$$ K_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{2.0 + 3.0}{\\frac{(2.0)(0.925)}{0.40} + \\frac{(3.0)(0.12)}{0.30}} \\,\\text{cm}^2 $$\nFirst, calculate the terms in the denominator:\n$$ \\frac{(2.0)(0.925)}{0.40} = \\frac{1.85}{0.40} = 4.625 $$\n$$ \\frac{(3.0)(0.12)}{0.30} = \\frac{0.36}{0.30} = 1.2 $$\nThe denominator is $4.625 + 1.2 = 5.825$. The numerator is $L_1+L_2 = 5.0$.\n$$ K_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{5.0}{5.825} \\,\\text{cm}^2 $$\nFinally, we compute the effective age $\\tau_{\\text{eff}}(E)$:\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{eff}}(E) = K_{\\text{eff}} \\cdot u(E) = \\left( \\frac{5.0}{5.825} \\right) \\ln(2.0 \\times 10^7) \\,\\text{cm}^2 $$\nUsing a calculator for the numerical values:\n$$ \\ln(2.0 \\times 10^7) \\approx 16.8112428 $$\n$$ K_{\\text{eff}} \\approx 0.8583690987 \\,\\text{cm}^2 $$\n$$ \\tau_{\\text{eff}}(E) \\approx 0.8583690987 \\times 16.8112428 \\approx 14.430035 \\,\\text{cm}^2 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, as requested, we obtain $\\tau_{\\text{eff}}(E) = 14.43\\,\\text{cm}^2$.",
