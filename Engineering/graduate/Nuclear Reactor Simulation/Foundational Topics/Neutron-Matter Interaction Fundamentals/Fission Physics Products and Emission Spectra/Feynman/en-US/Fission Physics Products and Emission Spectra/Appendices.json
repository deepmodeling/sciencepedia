All provided data and the physical model (Maxwellian spectrum for fission neutrons) are standard in the field of nuclear reactor physics. The problem is therefore valid, and a solution can be formulated.\n\nThe solution proceeds by following the three steps outlined in the problem statement.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the ensemble-average kinetic energy per prompt neutron, $\\langle \\epsilon_{n} \\rangle$**\n\nThe ensemble-average kinetic energy, $\\langle \\epsilon_{n} \\rangle$, of a prompt neutron is the expectation value of the energy variable $E$ with respect to its Probability Density Function (PDF), $f_{n}(E;T)$. The definition of the expectation value for a continuous variable distributed over $[0, \\infty)$ is:\n$$\n\\langle \\epsilon_{n} \\rangle = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} E \\cdot f_{n}(E;T) \\, dE\n$$\nSubstituting the given Maxwellian PDF:\n$$\nf_{n}(E;T) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\,\\frac{1}{T^{3/2}}\\,\\sqrt{E}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E}{T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $T$ is the temperature parameter in energy units. The integral for the average energy becomes:\n$$\n\\langle \\epsilon_{n} \\rangle = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} E \\left( \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi} \\, T^{3/2}} E^{1/2} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E}{T}\\right) \\right) dE\n$$\nWe can combine the terms involving $E$ and move the constants outside the integral:\n$$\n\\langle \\epsilon_{n} \\rangle = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi} \\, T^{3/2}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} E^{3/2} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E}{T}\\right) dE\n$$\nTo evaluate this integral, we perform a change of variables. Let $x = E/T$. Then $E = xT$ and $dE = T dx$. The limits of integration remain from $0$ to $\\infty$. Substituting these into the integral:\n$$\n\\langle \\epsilon_{n} \\rangle = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi} \\, T^{3/2}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (xT)^{3/2} \\exp(-x) \\, (T \\, dx)\n$$\n$$\n\\langle \\epsilon_{n} \\rangle = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi} \\, T^{3/2}} \\, T^{3/2} \\, T \\int_{0}^{\\infty} x^{3/2} \\exp(-x) \\, dx\n$$\n$$\n\\langle \\epsilon_{n} \\rangle = \\frac{2T}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} x^{3/2} \\exp(-x) \\, dx\n$$\nThe remaining integral is in the form of the Gamma function, $\\Gamma(z) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t^{z-1} \\exp(-t) \\, dt$. In our case, the exponent of $x$ is $3/2$, so $z-1 = 3/2$, which implies $z=5/2$. Therefore, the integral is $\\Gamma(5/2)$.\nThe Gamma function has the property $\\Gamma(z+1) = z\\Gamma(z)$. We can use this to evaluate $\\Gamma(5/2)$:\n$$\n\\Gamma(5/2) = \\Gamma(3/2 + 1) = \\frac{3}{2} \\Gamma(3/2) = \\frac{3}{2} \\Gamma(1/2 + 1) = \\frac{3}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\Gamma(1/2) \\right)\n$$\nGiven that $\\Gamma(1/2) = \\sqrt{\\pi}$, we have:\n$$\n\\Gamma(5/2) = \\frac{3}{4} \\sqrt{\\pi}\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $\\langle \\epsilon_{n} \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\langle \\epsilon_{n} \\rangle = \\frac{2T}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\left( \\frac{3\\sqrt{\\pi}}{4} \\right) = \\frac{3}{2}T\n$$\nThis is the analytical expression for the average kinetic energy of a neutron described by the Maxwellian spectrum. With the given temperature parameter $T = 1.32~\\text{MeV}$:\n$$\n\\langle \\epsilon_{n} \\rangle = \\frac{3}{2} (1.32~\\text{MeV}) = 1.98~\\text{MeV}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the total average prompt neutron energy per fission event**\n\nThe total average prompt neutron energy per fission, which we denote as $E_{n, \\text{total}}$, is the product of the average number of prompt neutrons emitted per fission, $\\bar{\\nu}$, and the average kinetic energy per neutron, $\\langle \\epsilon_{n} \\rangle$. The neutrons are treated as independent and identically distributed.\n$$\nE_{n, \\text{total}} = \\bar{\\nu} \\cdot \\langle \\epsilon_{n} \\rangle\n$$\nUsing the given value $\\bar{\\nu} = 2.43$ and the result from Part 1:\n$$\nE_{n, \\text{total}} = 2.43 \\times 1.98~\\text{MeV} = 4.8114~\\text{MeV}\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Determination of the residual energy, $E_{\\text{res}}$**\n\nThe principle of energy conservation dictates that the total energy released in the fission event, the Q-value ($Q$), must be fully accounted for by the energies of all the products. The problem specifies the major prompt energy components: the kinetic energy of the fission fragments ($E_{F}$), the total kinetic energy of the prompt neutrons ($E_{n, \\text{total}}$), and the total energy of prompt gamma rays ($E_{\\gamma}$). The remaining energy is the residual energy, $E_{\\text{res}}$, which primarily includes the decay energy of fission products (beta particles, antineutrinos, and delayed gamma rays).\nThe energy balance equation is:\n$$\nQ = E_{F} + E_{n, \\text{total}} + E_{\\gamma} + E_{\\text{res}}\n$$\nWe can solve for $E_{\\text{res}}$:\n$$\nE_{\\text{res}} = Q - E_{F} - E_{n, \\text{total}} - E_{\\gamma}\n$$\nSubstituting the given and calculated values:\n$Q = 202.36~\\text{MeV}$\n$E_{F} = 167.4~\\text{MeV}$\n$E_{n, \\text{total}} = 4.8114~\\text{MeV}$\n$E_{\\gamma} = 6.6~\\text{MeV}$\n$$\nE_{\\text{res}} = 202.36~\\text{MeV} - 167.4~\\text{MeV} - 4.8114~\\text{MeV} - 6.6~\\text{MeV}\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\text{res}} = 202.36~\\text{MeV} - (167.4 + 4.8114 + 6.6)~\\text{MeV}\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\text{res}} = 202.36~\\text{MeV} - 178.8114~\\text{MeV}\n$$\n$$\nE_{\\text{res}} = 23.5486~\\text{MeV}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nE_{\\text{res}} \\approx 23.55~\\text{MeV}\n$$\nThis residual energy accounts for channels not included in the prompt energy release, such as the energy carried away by beta particles and antineutrinos from the subsequent decay of the unstable fission fragments, as well as delayed gamma and neutron emissions.",

The fragment moves with a constant velocity $\\vec{v}$ relative to S. We align the coordinate systems such that the fragment moves along the positive $x$-axis, so $\\vec{v} = v \\hat{x}$. The speed of the fragment is $v$, and we define the dimensionless velocity as $\\beta = v/c$ and the Lorentz factor as $\\gamma = (1 - \\beta^2)^{-1/2}$.\n\nIn the fragment's rest frame S', the gamma ray has energy $E_{0}$ and its three-momentum $\\vec{p}'$ has magnitude $|\\vec{p}'| = E_{0}/c$. The emission is isotropic, so the direction of $\\vec{p}'$ is uniformly distributed over all solid angles. Let $\\theta'$ be the angle between the photon's momentum vector $\\vec{p}'$ and the $x'$-axis (the direction of motion). The photon's four-momentum in S' can be written as:\n$$ p'^{\\mu} = \\begin{pmatrix} E'/c \\\\ p'_x \\\\ p'_y \\\\ p'_z \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} E_0/c \\\\ (E_0/c)\\cos\\theta' \\\\ (E_0/c)\\sin\\theta'\\cos\\phi' \\\\ (E_0/c)\\sin\\theta'\\sin\\phi' \\end{pmatrix} $$\nFor simplicity, we can orient the $y'$-axis in the plane of emission, making $\\phi'=0$.\n$$ p'^{\\mu} = \\begin{pmatrix} E_0/c \\\\ (E_0/c)\\cos\\theta' \\\\ (E_0/c)\\sin\\theta' \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThe four-momentum $p^{\\mu}$ in the laboratory frame S is obtained by applying the Lorentz transformation for a boost along the $x$-axis:\n$$ p^{\\mu} = \\Lambda^{\\mu}_{\\nu} p'^{\\nu} $$\nwhere the Lorentz transformation matrix is:\n$$ \\Lambda^{\\mu}_{\\nu} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\gamma & \\gamma\\beta & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\gamma\\beta & \\gamma & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThe energy of the photon in the laboratory frame, $E_{\\mathrm{lab}}$, is the time component of the four-momentum $p^{\\mu}$, i.e., $E_{\\mathrm{lab}} = c p^0$.\n$$ p^0 = \\Lambda^0_0 p'^0 + \\Lambda^0_1 p'^1 = \\gamma (E_0/c) + \\gamma\\beta ((E_0/c)\\cos\\theta') $$\n$$ \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{lab}}}{c} = \\frac{\\gamma E_0}{c} (1 + \\beta \\cos\\theta') $$\nThus, the laboratory-frame photon energy is:\n$$ E_{\\mathrm{lab}}(\\theta') = E_0 \\gamma (1 + \\beta \\cos\\theta') $$\nThis is the relativistic Doppler shift formula, which is the first part of the required derivation.\n\nNext, we compute the angle-averaged laboratory-frame energy, $\\langle E_{\\mathrm{lab}} \\rangle$.

The decay constant $\\lambda$ is related to the half-life $t_{1/2}$ by $\\lambda = \\frac{\\ln 2}{t_{1/2}}$.\nGiven values:\n$y_1 = 0.035$, $y_2 = 0.020$\n$b_1 = 0.85$, $b_2 = 0.75$\n$t_{1/2,1} = 30\\,\\mathrm{s}$, $t_{1/2,2} = 300\\,\\mathrm{s}$, $t_{1/2,D} = 1200\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n$T = 1800\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n\nThe decay constants are:\n$$ \\lambda_1 = \\frac{\\ln 2}{30} \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\lambda_2 = \\frac{\\ln 2}{300} \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n$$ \\lambda_D = \\frac{\\ln 2}{1200} \\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $$\n\nNow, we evaluate the terms for $T=1800\\,\\mathrm{s}$:\nThe exponential arguments are:\n$$ \\lambda_1 T = \\frac{\\ln 2}{30} \\times 1800 = 60 \\ln 2 $$\n$$ \\lambda_2 T = \\frac{\\ln 2}{300} \\times 1800 = 6 \\ln 2 $$\n$$ \\lambda_D T = \\frac{\\ln 2}{1200} \\times 1800 = 1.5 \\ln 2 = \\frac{3}{2}\\ln 2 $$\nThe exponential terms are:\n$$ \\exp(-\\lambda_1 T) = \\exp(-60 \\ln 2) = (2)^{-60} \\approx 8.67 \\times 10^{-19} \\approx 0 $$\n$$ \\exp(-\\lambda_2 T) = \\exp(-6 \\ln 2) = (2)^{-6} = \\frac{1}{64} = 0.015625 $$\n$$ \\exp(-\\lambda_D T) = \\exp(-\\frac{3}{2} \\ln 2) = (2)^{-3/2} = \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{4} \\approx 0.353553 $$\n\nThe coefficients for the second pathway term are:\n$$ \\lambda_D - \\lambda_2 = \\frac{\\ln 2}{1200} - \\frac{\\ln 2}{300} = \\left(\\frac{1}{1200} - \\frac{4}{1200}\\right)\\ln 2 = -\\frac{3\\ln 2}{1200} = -\\frac{\\ln 2}{400} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\lambda_D}{\\lambda_D - \\lambda_2} = \\frac{\\ln 2 / 1200}{-\\ln 2 / 400} = -\\frac{400}{1200} = -\\frac{1}{3} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\lambda_2}{\\lambda_D - \\lambda_2} = \\frac{\\ln 2 / 300}{-\\ln 2 / 400} = -\\frac{400}{300} = -\\frac{4}{3} $$\n\nNow, we compute the two contributions to the yield at $T=1800\\,\\mathrm{s}$:\n$$ Y_{N,1}(1800) = b_1 y_1 (1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_1 T)) \\approx (0.85)(0.035)(1 - 0) = 0.02975 $$\n$$ Y_{N,2}(1800) = b_2 y_2 \\left( 1 - \\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\exp(-\\lambda_2 T) + \\left(-\\frac{4}{3}\\right) \\exp(-\\lambda_D T) \\right) $$\n$$ Y_{N,2}(1800) = (0.75)(0.020) \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{3} \\exp(-6 \\ln 2) - \\frac{4}{3} \\exp(-\\frac{3}{2} \\ln 2) \\right) $$\n$$ Y_{N,2}(1800) = 0.015 \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{64} - \\frac{4}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\right) $$\n$$ Y_{N,2}(1800) = 0.015 \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{192} - \\frac{2}{3\\sqrt{2}} \\right) = 0.015 \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{192} - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3} \\right) $$\nUsing numerical values:\n$$ Y_{N,2}(1800) \\approx 0.015 \\left( 1 + 0.00520833 - 0.47140452 \\right) $$\n$$ Y_{N,2}(1800) \\approx 0.015 \\left( 0.53380381 \\right) \\approx 0.00800706 $$\n\nThe total cumulative yield is the sum:\n$$ Y_N(1800) = Y_{N,1}(1800) + Y_{N,2}(1800) \\approx 0.02975 + 0.00800706 $$\n$$ Y_N(1800) \\approx 0.03775706 $$\nRounding to four significant figures as requested gives $0.03776$.",
