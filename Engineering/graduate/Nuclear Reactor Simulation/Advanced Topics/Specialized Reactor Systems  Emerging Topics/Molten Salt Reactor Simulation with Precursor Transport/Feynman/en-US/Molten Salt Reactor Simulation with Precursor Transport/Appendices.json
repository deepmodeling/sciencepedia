This exercise guides you through comparing the effects of advection (transport by bulk flow) versus diffusion (transport by molecular motion) for neutron precursors in a molten salt reactor. By analyzing the characteristic timescales of these processes, you will derive the Péclet number and justify when it is appropriate to simplify the governing transport equations by neglecting diffusion, a common and powerful simplification in MSR modeling .",

            "problem": "In a primary loop channel of a Molten Salt Reactor (MSR), consider the transport of a single delayed neutron precursor species with concentration field $C_{i}(\\boldsymbol{x},t)$ carried by an incompressible velocity field $\\boldsymbol{u}(\\boldsymbol{x},t)$ of characteristic magnitude $U$ along a characteristic length scale $L$. The precursor undergoes nuclear decay with decay constant $\\lambda_{i}$ and is generated volumetrically by fission with a source density $S_{i}(\\boldsymbol{x},t)$. The molecular diffusion coefficient of the precursor in the molten salt is $D_{i}$, assumed constant. The governing conservation law for the precursor is based on species continuity and Fickian diffusion, with diffusive flux $\\boldsymbol{J}_{i}=-D_{i}\\nabla C_{i}$.\n\nStarting from these principles, formulate a scale analysis that compares the advective timescale $L/U$ and the diffusive timescale $L^{2}/D_{i}$ for the transport of $C_{i}$. Use this comparison to justify hydrodynamic and molecular conditions under which the diffusive contribution $-\\nabla\\cdot(D_{i}\\nabla C_{i})$ to the species balance may be neglected relative to advection, explicitly identifying how velocity magnitude, length scale, and molecular diffusivity enter the criterion. Then, define the fractional error $\\varepsilon_{i}$ introduced by neglecting diffusion as the ratio of the characteristic magnitude of the diffusive term to that of the advective term obtained by the same scale analysis.\n\nFinally, evaluate $\\varepsilon_{i}$ for the following scientifically plausible MSR operating parameters: $U=0.40\\ \\text{m}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$, $L=2.0\\ \\text{m}$, and $D_{i}=3.0\\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{m}^{2}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for a scale analysis of the transport of a delayed neutron precursor species in a molten salt reactor, a justification for neglecting diffusion under certain conditions, and the calculation of a fractional error. The solution will proceed by first establishing the governing transport equation, then performing the scale analysis, and finally calculating the requested numerical value.\n\nThe conservation law for the precursor species concentration, $C_{i}(\\boldsymbol{x},t)$, is given by the principle of species continuity. The rate of change of concentration in a control volume is balanced by the net flux into the volume and the net rate of generation within the volume. This can be expressed as a partial differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C_{i}}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\Phi}_{i} = R_{i}\n$$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}_{i}$ is the total flux of the species and $R_{i}$ is the net volumetric rate of production.\n\nThe total flux $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}_{i}$ is the sum of the advective flux, $C_{i}\\boldsymbol{u}$, and the diffusive flux, $\\boldsymbol{J}_{i}$. The problem states that the diffusive flux is given by Fick's law, $\\boldsymbol{J}_{i} = -D_{i}\\nabla C_{i}$. Thus, the total flux is:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}_{i} = C_{i}\\boldsymbol{u}(\\boldsymbol{x},t) - D_{i}\\nabla C_{i}(\\boldsymbol{x},t)\n$$\nThe net volumetric production rate $R_{i}$ is the sum of creation by fission, $S_{i}(\\boldsymbol{x},t)$, and destruction by radioactive decay, which is $-\\lambda_{i}C_{i}(\\boldsymbol{x},t)$.\n$$\nR_{i} = S_{i}(\\boldsymbol{x},t) - \\lambda_{i}C_{i}(\\boldsymbol{x},t)\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the conservation law gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C_{i}}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\left( C_{i}\\boldsymbol{u} - D_{i}\\nabla C_{i} \\right) = S_{i} - \\lambda_{i}C_{i}\n$$\nThe velocity field $\\boldsymbol{u}$ is for an incompressible fluid, which means $\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u} = 0$. The diffusion coefficient $D_{i}$ is assumed constant. We can expand the divergence term:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\left( C_{i}\\boldsymbol{u} - D_{i}\\nabla C_{i} \\right) = \\nabla \\cdot (C_{i}\\boldsymbol{u}) - \\nabla \\cdot (D_{i}\\nabla C_{i}) = (\\boldsymbol{u} \\cdot \\nabla C_{i} + C_{i}(\\nabla \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u})) - D_{i}\\nabla^{2}C_{i} = \\boldsymbol{u} \\cdot \\nabla C_{i} - D_{i}\\nabla^{2}C_{i}\n$$\nThe full transport equation is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C_{i}}{\\partial t} + \\boldsymbol{u} \\cdot \\nabla C_{i} = D_{i}\\nabla^{2}C_{i} + S_{i} - \\lambda_{i}C_{i}\n$$\nThis is the advection-diffusion-reaction equation. The term $\\boldsymbol{u} \\cdot \\nabla C_{i}$ represents transport by advection, and the term $D_{i}\\nabla^{2}C_{i}$ represents transport by diffusion. The problem refers to the \"diffusive contribution\" as $-\\nabla\\cdot(D_{i}\\nabla C_{i}) = -D_i \\nabla^2 C_i$. The magnitude of this contribution is what we will compare with the advective term.\n\nWe now perform a scale analysis to compare the magnitudes of the advective and diffusive transport terms. Let $L$ be the characteristic length scale of the system, $U$ be the characteristic magnitude of the velocity field, and $\\Delta C_{i}$ be the characteristic variation in precursor concentration over the length $L$.\nThe derivatives can be approximated by the ratios of the characteristic scales:\n$$\n\\nabla \\sim \\frac{1}{L}, \\quad \\nabla^{2} \\sim \\frac{1}{L^{2}}\n$$\nThe characteristic magnitude of the advection term is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{O}(\\boldsymbol{u} \\cdot \\nabla C_{i}) \\sim U \\frac{\\Delta C_{i}}{L}\n$$\nThe characteristic magnitude of the diffusion term is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{O}(D_{i}\\nabla^{2}C_{i}) \\sim D_{i}\\frac{\\Delta C_{i}}{L^{2}}\n$$\nThe problem asks for a comparison of the timescales associated with these two transport mechanisms.\nThe advective timescale, $\\tau_{adv}$, is the characteristic time required for a fluid element to travel the distance $L$. It is given by:\n$$\n\\tau_{adv} = \\frac{L}{U}\n$$\nThe diffusive timescale, $\\tau_{diff}$, is the characteristic time for a species to diffuse across the distance $L$. A simple scaling of the time-dependent diffusion equation, $\\partial C_{i}/\\partial t \\sim D_{i}\\nabla^2 C_{i}$, yields $\\Delta C_{i}/\\tau_{diff} \\sim D_i \\Delta C_{i}/L^2$. This gives:\n$$\n\\tau_{diff} = \\frac{L^2}{D_i}\n$$\nTo justify neglecting the diffusive contribution relative to advection, the advective transport must be dominant. This means that transport by bulk flow is much faster than transport by molecular diffusion. In terms of timescales, this condition is expressed as the advective timescale being much shorter than the diffusive timescale:\n$$\n\\tau_{adv} \\ll \\tau_{diff} \\implies \\frac{L}{U} \\ll \\frac{L^2}{D_i}\n$$\nRearranging this inequality, we obtain a criterion based on a dimensionless group:\n$$\n1 \\ll \\frac{UL^2}{D_i L} \\implies \\frac{UL}{D_i} \\gg 1\n$$\nThis dimensionless group is the Péclet number for mass transfer, $Pe = \\frac{UL}{D_i}$. It represents the ratio of the rate of advection to the rate of diffusion. Thus, the condition to neglect diffusion is that the Péclet number must be much greater than unity ($Pe \\gg 1$).\nThe components of this criterion relate to the hydrodynamic and molecular conditions as follows:\n1. Velocity magnitude $U$: Diffusion can be neglected for high flow velocities.\n2. Length scale $L$: Diffusion becomes less significant over large length scales.\n3. Molecular diffusivity $D_{i}$: Diffusion can be neglected for species with very low diffusivity in the medium.\nHigh $U$, large $L$, and small $D_i$ all contribute to a large Péclet number, strengthening the dominance of advection.\n\nThe fractional error $\\varepsilon_{i}$ introduced by neglecting diffusion is defined as the ratio of the characteristic magnitude of the diffusive term to that of the advective term. Using our scale analysis:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{i} = \\frac{\\mathcal{O}(D_{i}\\nabla^{2}C_{i})}{\\mathcal{O}(\\boldsymbol{u} \\cdot \\nabla C_{i})} = \\frac{D_{i}\\Delta C_{i}/L^2}{U\\Delta C_{i}/L} = \\frac{D_{i}}{UL}\n$$\nThis fractional error is the inverse of the Péclet number, $\\varepsilon_{i} = \\frac{1}{Pe}$.\n\nFinally, we evaluate $\\varepsilon_{i}$ for the given MSR operating parameters:\n$U = 0.40\\ \\text{m}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$\n$L = 2.0\\ \\text{m}$\n$D_{i} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{m}^{2}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $\\varepsilon_{i}$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{i} = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{m}^{2}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}}{(0.40\\ \\text{m}\\ \\text{s}^{-1})(2.0\\ \\text{m})} = \\frac{3.0 \\times 10^{-9}}{0.80}\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{i} = 3.75 \\times 10^{-9}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\varepsilon_{i} = 3.750 \\times 10^{-9}\n$$\nThis extremely small value for $\\varepsilon_i$ (or, equivalently, a very large Péclet number $Pe = 1/\\varepsilon_i \\approx 2.67 \\times 10^8$) confirms that for these scientifically plausible parameters, neglecting molecular diffusion in the precursor transport equation is an excellent approximation in the bulk flow regions of an MSR primary loop.",
