All provided parameters are physically reasonable for the specified context of a one-speed model of an accelerator-driven system. Therefore, I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core of the problem is the principle of neutron conservation. For a homogeneous medium, we can write a balance equation for the neutron density $n$ in a unit volume. The rate of change of neutron density is the sum of the rates of production, loss, and any external sources.\n$$\n\\frac{dn}{dt} = \\text{Production Rate} - \\text{Loss Rate} + \\text{External Source Rate}\n$$\nThe problem specifies a steady-state condition, which means the neutron population is constant in time.

It is a standard, formalizable problem in nuclear engineering.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\nThe derivation begins from the steady-state neutron balance equation. In an arbitrary volume $V$, the rate of neutron loss must equal the rate of neutron production. For a differential volume element in one dimension, this balance is expressed as:\n$$\n\\text{Leakage rate} + \\text{Absorption rate} = \\text{Source rate}\n$$\nIn group $g$, for a one-dimensional slab geometry, the balance equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{dJ_g(x)}{dx} + \\Sigma_{a,g} \\phi_g(x) = S_g(x)\n$$\nHere, $J_g(x)$ is the neutron current density, $\\Sigma_{a,g} \\phi_g(x)$ is the reaction rate density for absorption, and $S_g(x)$ is the total source density of neutrons into group $g$. For this problem, the scattering from other energy groups is ignored (one-speed model), and any fission source is neglected as the system is described as subcritical and driven by an external source. The source term is therefore just the external source, $S_g(x) = Q_0$, which is spatially uniform. The balance equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dJ_g(x)}{dx} + \\Sigma_{a,g} \\phi_g(x) = Q_0\n$$\nThe neutron current $J_g(x)$ is related to the gradient of the scalar flux $\\phi_g(x)$ by Fick's law of diffusion:\n$$\nJ_g(x) = -D_g \\frac{d\\phi_g(x)}{dx}\n$$\nSubstituting Fick's law into the neutron balance equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\left(-D_g \\frac{d\\phi_g(x)}{dx}\\right) + \\Sigma_{a,g} \\phi_g(x) = Q_0\n$$\nSince the diffusion coefficient $D_g$ is spatially uniform, it can be taken out of the derivative:\n$$\n-D_g \\frac{d^2\\phi_g(x)}{dx^2} + \\Sigma_{a,g} \\phi_g(x) = Q_0\n$$\nRearranging the terms, we obtain the one-speed, steady-state neutron diffusion equation for the slab with a uniform source:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\phi_g(x)}{dx^2} - \\frac{\\Sigma_{a,g}}{D_g} \\phi_g(x) = -\\frac{Q_0}{D_g}\n$$\nLet's define the square of the inverse of the diffusion length, $k^2 \\equiv \\frac{\\Sigma_{a,g}}{D_g}$. The equation is a second-order, linear, inhomogeneous ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2\\phi_g(x)}{dx^2} - k^2 \\phi_g(x) = -\\frac{Q_0}{D_g}\n$$\nThe general solution $\\phi_g(x)$ is the sum of a homogeneous solution $\\phi_h(x)$ and a particular solution $\\phi_p(x)$.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is $\\frac{d^2\\phi_h(x)}{dx^2} - k^2 \\phi_h(x) = 0$. The characteristic equation is $r^2 - k^2 = 0$, with roots $r = \\pm k$. The homogeneous solution can be written as:\n$$\n\\phi_h(x) = A \\cosh(kx) + B \\sinh(kx)\n$$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants to be determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nFor the particular solution, since the right-hand side is a constant, we can assume a constant particular solution $\\phi_p(x) = C$. Substituting this into the full differential equation gives:\n$$\n0 - k^2 C = -\\frac{Q_0}{D_g} \\implies C = \\frac{Q_0}{k^2 D_g} = \\frac{Q_0}{(\\Sigma_{a,g}/D_g) D_g} = \\frac{Q_0}{\\Sigma_{a,g}}\n$$\nSo, the particular solution is $\\phi_p(x) = \\frac{Q_0}{\\Sigma_{a,g}}$.\n\nThe general solution is the sum of the homogeneous and particular solutions:\n$$\n\\phi_g(x) = A \\cosh(kx) + B \\sinh(kx) + \\frac{Q_0}{\\Sigma_{a,g}}\n$$\nNow, we apply the boundary conditions $\\phi_g(0)=0$ and $\\phi_g(L)=0$.\nAt $x=0$:\n$$\n\\phi_g(0) = A \\cosh(0) + B \\sinh(0) + \\frac{Q_0}{\\Sigma_{a,g}} = A \\cdot 1 + B \\cdot 0 + \\frac{Q_0}{\\Sigma_{a,g}} = 0\n$$\nThis gives $A = -\\frac{Q_0}{\\Sigma_{a,g}}$.\n\nAt $x=L$:\n$$\n\\phi_g(L) = A \\cosh(kL) + B \\sinh(kL) + \\frac{Q_0}{\\Sigma_{a,g}} = 0\n$$\nSubstitute the value of $A$:\n$$\n-\\frac{Q_0}{\\Sigma_{a,g}} \\cosh(kL) + B \\sinh(kL) + \\frac{Q_0}{\\Sigma_{a,g}} = 0\n$$\n$$\nB \\sinh(kL) = \\frac{Q_0}{\\Sigma_{a,g}} (\\cosh(kL) - 1)\n$$\n$$\nB = \\frac{Q_0}{\\Sigma_{a,g}} \\frac{\\cosh(kL)-1}{\\sinh(kL)}\n$$\nUsing the hyperbolic identities $\\cosh(2\\theta) = 2\\cosh^2(\\theta)-1$ and $\\sinh(2\\theta) = 2\\sinh(\\theta)\\cosh(\\theta)$, we can simplify the expression for $B$:\n$$\nB = \\frac{Q_0}{\\Sigma_{a,g}} \\frac{2\\cosh^2(kL/2)-2}{2\\sinh(kL/2)\\cosh(kL/2)} = \\frac{Q_0}{\\Sigma_{a,g}} \\frac{2\\sinh^2(kL/2)}{2\\sinh(kL/2)\\cosh(kL/2)} = \\frac{Q_0}{\\Sigma_{a,g}} \\tanh(kL/2)\n$$\nSubstituting the constants $A$ and $B$ back into the general solution:\n$$\n\\phi_g(x) = -\\frac{Q_0}{\\Sigma_{a,g}} \\cosh(kx) + \\frac{Q_0}{\\Sigma_{a,g}} \\tanh(kL/2) \\sinh(kx) + \\frac{Q_0}{\\Sigma_{a,g}}\n$$\n$$\n\\phi_g(x) = \\frac{Q_0}{\\Sigma_{a,g}} \\left( 1 - \\cosh(kx) + \\tanh(kL/2) \\sinh(kx) \\right)\n$$\nThis expression can be simplified further. Recognizing the symmetry of the problem, a coordinate system centered in the slab $x' = x - L/2$ simplifies the algebra. In this system, the solution must be an even function, so the $\\sinh$ term vanishes. The solution takes the form $\\phi_g(x') = A' \\cosh(kx') + \\frac{Q_0}{\\Sigma_{a,g}}$ with boundary conditions $\\phi_g(\\pm L/2) = 0$. This leads to:\n$$\nA' \\cosh(kL/2) + \\frac{Q_0}{\\Sigma_{a,g}} = 0 \\implies A' = -\\frac{Q_0/\\Sigma_{a,g}}{\\cosh(kL/2)}\n$$\nSo, the solution in the shifted coordinates is:\n$$\n\\phi_g(x') = \\frac{Q_0}{\\Sigma_{a,g}} \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\cosh(kx')}{\\cosh(kL/2)} \\right)\n$$\nTransforming back to the original coordinate system $x = x' + L/2$:\n$$\n\\phi_g(x) = \\frac{Q_0}{\\Sigma_{a,g}} \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\cosh(k(x - L/2))}{\\cosh(kL/2)} \\right)\n$$\nFinally, substituting back $k = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\Sigma_{a,g}}{D_g}}$ gives the final expression for the scalar flux distribution:\n$$\n\\phi_g(x) = \\frac{Q_0}{\\Sigma_{a,g}} \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\cosh\\left(\\left(x - \\frac{L}{2}\\right) \\sqrt{\\frac{\\Sigma_{a,g}}{D_g}}\\right)}{\\cosh\\left(\\frac{L}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\Sigma_{a,g}}{D_g}}\\right)} \\right)\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the steady-state scalar flux.",

Using the first-order Taylor expansion $\\exp(x) \\approx 1 + x$ for small $x$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\Delta P}{P}\\right)_{\\text{crit}, t_0} \\approx (1 + \\omega_d t_0) - 1 = \\omega_d t_0\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\omega_d$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\Delta P}{P}\\right)_{\\text{crit}, t_0} \\approx \\frac{\\delta\\rho \\cdot t_0}{\\Lambda + \\beta/\\lambda}\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio of the magnitudes of these two fractional changes.\n$$\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\left| \\left(\\frac{\\Delta P}{P}\\right)_{\\text{ADS}} \\right|}{\\left| \\left(\\frac{\\Delta P}{P}\\right)_{\\text{crit}, t_0} \\right|} = \\frac{|-\\delta\\rho / \\rho_0|}{|\\delta\\rho \\cdot t_0 / (\\Lambda + \\beta/\\lambda)|}\n$$\nSince $\\delta\\rho > 0$, $\\rho_0  0$, and all other parameters ($\\Lambda, \\beta, \\lambda, t_0$) are positive, the magnitudes are:\n$$\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\delta\\rho / (-\\rho_0)}{\\delta\\rho \\cdot t_0 / (\\Lambda + \\beta/\\lambda)}\n$$\nThe term $\\delta\\rho$ cancels, leaving:\n$$\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{1}{-\\rho_0} \\cdot \\frac{\\Lambda + \\beta/\\lambda}{t_0} = \\frac{\\Lambda + \\beta/\\lambda}{-\\rho_0 t_0}\n$$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values:\n$\\beta = 0.0065$\n$\\lambda = 0.08 \\,\\text{s}^{-1}$\n$\\Lambda = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\,\\text{s}$\n$\\rho_0 = -0.003$\n$t_0 = 1.0 \\,\\text{s}$\n\nFirst, calculate the term $\\beta/\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\beta}{\\lambda} = \\frac{0.0065}{0.08 \\,\\text{s}^{-1}} = 0.08125 \\,\\text{s}\n$$\nNext, calculate the numerator $\\Lambda + \\beta/\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\Lambda + \\frac{\\beta}{\\lambda} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\,\\text{s} + 0.08125 \\,\\text{s} = 0.0001 \\,\\text{s} + 0.08125 \\,\\text{s} = 0.08135 \\,\\text{s}\n$$\nNext, calculate the denominator $-\\rho_0 t_0$:\n$$\n-\\rho_0 t_0 = -(-0.003) \\times 1.0 \\,\\text{s} = 0.003 \\,\\text{s}\n$$\nFinally, compute the ratio:\n$$\n\\text{Ratio} = \\frac{0.08135 \\,\\text{s}}{0.003 \\,\\text{s}} = 27.11666...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the result is $27.12$. This ratio indicates that for the same small reactivity insertion, the steady-state power response of the ADS is significantly more sensitive (by a factor of about $27$) than the transient power response of the critical reactor at time $t_0=1.0\\,\\text{s}$.",
