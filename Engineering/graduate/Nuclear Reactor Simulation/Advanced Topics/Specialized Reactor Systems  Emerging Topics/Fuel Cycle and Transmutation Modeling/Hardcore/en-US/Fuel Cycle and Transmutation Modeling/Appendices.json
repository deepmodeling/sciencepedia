The derivation proceeds from first principles as requested.\n\nBranching decay is a phenomenon where a single radionuclide has multiple, mutually exclusive decay modes, each resulting in a different daughter nuclide. The overall decay process is governed by first-order kinetics. The rate of change of the number of parent atoms, $N_A(t)$, is proportional to the number of atoms present at time $t$. The constant of proportionality is the total decay constant, $\\lambda_A$. This total decay constant is the sum of the partial decay constants associated with each decay channel. For the given problem, parent nuclide $A$ decays to daughter $B$ or daughter $C$.

The rate of production of $B$ is the rate at which $A$ decays specifically into $B$, which is given by $\\lambda_{A \\to B} N_A(t)$. The rate of decay of $B$ is $\\lambda_B N_B(t)$.
