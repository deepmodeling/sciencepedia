Define the concept of branching decay from first principles, and then construct the time-dependent inventory of one of the daughter nuclides using first-order kinetics. Specifically, let parent nuclide $A$ undergo two mutually exclusive decay channels to distinct daughters $B$ and $C$ with partial decay constants $\\lambda_{A \\to B}$ and $\\lambda_{A \\to C}$, respectively. The total decay constant of $A$ is $\\lambda_{A} = \\lambda_{A \\to B} + \\lambda_{A \\to C}$. The branching ratios are defined as $r_{B} = \\lambda_{A \\to B}/\\lambda_{A}$ and $r_{C} = \\lambda_{A \\to C}/\\lambda_{A}$, with $r_{B} + r_{C} = 1$. After being formed, $B$ and $C$ each decay independently to their own stable products with decay constants $\\lambda_{B}$ and $\\lambda_{C}$, respectively, and neither $B$ nor $C$ feeds back into $A$ or each other.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of radioactive decay, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and is stated objectively. The derivation proceeds from first principles as requested.\n\nBranching decay is a phenomenon where a single radionuclide has multiple, mutually exclusive decay modes, each resulting in a different daughter nuclide. The overall decay process is governed by first-order kinetics. The rate of change of the number of parent atoms, $N_A(t)$, is proportional to the number of atoms present at time $t$. The constant of proportionality is the total decay constant, $\\lambda_A$. This total decay constant is the sum of the partial decay constants associated with each decay channel. For the given problem, parent nuclide $A$ decays to daughter $B$ or daughter $C$. The partial decay constant for the channel $A \\to B$ is $\\lambda_{A \\to B}$, and for the channel $A \\to C$ is $\\lambda_{A \\to C}$. The total decay constant is $\\lambda_A = \\lambda_{A \\to B} + \\lambda_{A \\to C}$.\n\nThe rate of depletion of nuclide $A$ is described by the first-order ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$\n\\frac{dN_A(t)}{dt} = -\\lambda_A N_A(t)\n$$\nThis is a separable differential equation, which can be solved by integration.\n$$\n\\int_{N_A(0)}^{N_A(t)} \\frac{dN_A}{N_A} = \\int_{0}^{t} -\\lambda_A dt'\n$$\nIntegrating both sides yields:\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{N_A(t)}{N_A(0)}\\right) = -\\lambda_A t\n$$\nUsing the initial condition $N_A(0) = N_0$, we obtain the expression for the number of atoms of nuclide $A$ as a function of time:\n$$\nN_A(t) = N_0 \\exp(-\\lambda_A t)\n$$\nThe rate of change of the number of atoms of daughter nuclide $B$, $N_B(t)$, is determined by its rate of production from the decay of $A$ and its own rate of decay. The rate of production of $B$ is the rate at which $A$ decays specifically into $B$, which is given by $\\lambda_{A \\to B} N_A(t)$. The rate of decay of $B$ is $\\lambda_B N_B(t)$. Thus, the governing ODE for $N_B(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dN_B(t)}{dt} = \\lambda_{A \\to B} N_A(t) - \\lambda_B N_B(t)\n$$\nUsing the definition of the branching ratio $r_B = \\lambda_{A \\to B} / \\lambda_A$, we can write $\\lambda_{A \\to B} = r_B \\lambda_A$.

These yields are measured at a time scale too short for any significant radioactive decay of the fragments to occur (typically $ 10^{-6}$ s). The sum of all independent yields for a given fission process, $\\sum_{A,Z} Y_I(A, Z)$, is equal to $2$, as (on average) two fragments are produced per fission.\n\nThe **Cumulative Fission Yield (CFY)**, denoted as $Y_C(A, Z)$, for a nuclide with mass number $A$ and atomic number $Z$, is the total probability that this nuclide is formed per fission event. This includes its direct formation (the independent yield) plus a contribution from the decay of all of its radioactive precursors within the same isobaric (constant $A$) decay chain. The CFY is thus the yield of a nuclide after sufficient time has passed for all its short-lived precursors to decay. For a stable or very long-lived nuclide at the end of a decay chain, its CFY represents the total yield for that mass number, and the sum of CFYs across all mass numbers, $\\sum_A Y_C(A)$, is approximately equal to $2$.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the Cumulative Fission Yield of the target nuclide, $Y_C(T)$, from first principles based on the conservation of probability.
