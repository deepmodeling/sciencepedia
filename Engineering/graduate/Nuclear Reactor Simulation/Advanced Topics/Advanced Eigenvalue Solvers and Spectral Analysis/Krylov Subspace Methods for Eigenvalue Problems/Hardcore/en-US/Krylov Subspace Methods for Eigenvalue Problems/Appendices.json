Let $A$ denote the loss operator (including absorption, out-scattering, and leakage) and $F$ denote the fission production operator. The multiplication operator is defined by $K = A^{-1} F$, so that the fundamental eigenpair satisfies $K \\phi_1 = \\lambda_1 \\phi_1$, where $\\lambda_1 = k_{\\text{eff}}$ is the effective neutron multiplication factor (with $k_{\\text{eff}} \\approx 1$ near criticality).

            "solution": "The problem asks for the minimum number of Krylov iterations, $n$, required for the error factor, $E(n)$, to be less than or equal to a specified tolerance $\\epsilon$. The Krylov method used is the power iteration for finding the dominant eigenpair of the multiplication operator $K$.\n\nLet the initial guess for the eigenvector be $\\phi^{(0)}$. The problem specifies a two-mode mixture:\n$$\n\\phi^{(0)} = c_1 \\phi_1 + c_2 \\phi_2\n$$\nwhere $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$ are the eigenvectors corresponding to the fundamental and first higher-order modes, respectively.

The set of eigenvectors $\\{\\phi_i\\}$ is stated to be orthonormal under a consistent inner product.\n\nThe power iteration method generates a sequence of vectors. The un-normalized vector after $n$ iterations, which we denote as $\\psi^{(n)}$, is obtained by applying the operator $K$ for $n$ times to the initial guess $\\phi^{(0)}$:\n$$\n\\psi^{(n)} = K^n \\phi^{(0)}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\phi^{(0)}$ and using the linearity of the operator $K^n$:\n$$\n\\psi^{(n)} = K^n (c_1 \\phi_1 + c_2 \\phi_2) = c_1 K^n \\phi_1 + c_2 K^n \\phi_2\n$$\nBy definition, $\\phi_i$ is an eigenvector of $K$ with eigenvalue $\\lambda_i$, so $K \\phi_i = \\lambda_i \\phi_i$. This implies that $K^n \\phi_i = \\lambda_i^n \\phi_i$. Applying this property, we get:\n$$\n\\psi^{(n)} = c_1 \\lambda_1^n \\phi_1 + c_2 \\lambda_2^n \\phi_2\n$$\nThis vector $\\psi^{(n)}$ represents the state of the solution after $n$ iterations, before normalization. The fundamental-mode component is $c_1 \\lambda_1^n \\phi_1$ and the second-mode component is $c_2 \\lambda_2^n \\phi_2$.\n\nThe problem defines the error factor $E(n)$ as the ratio of the magnitude of the second-mode component to the magnitude of the fundamental-mode component in the *normalized* iterate $\\phi^{(n)}$. The normalized iterate is $\\phi^{(n)} = \\psi^{(n)}/\\|\\psi^{(n)}\\|$. Since the eigenvectors are orthonormal, the coefficients of the normalized iterate are $d_1 = \\frac{c_1 \\lambda_1^n}{\\|\\psi^{(n)}\\|}$ and $d_2 = \\frac{c_2 \\lambda_2^n}{\\|\\psi^{(n)}\\|}$. The magnitude of each component in the normalized eigenvector expansion is the absolute value of its coefficient.
