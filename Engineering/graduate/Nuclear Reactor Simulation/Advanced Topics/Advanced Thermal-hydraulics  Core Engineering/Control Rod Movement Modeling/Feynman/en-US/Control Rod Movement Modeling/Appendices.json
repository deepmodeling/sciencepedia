It presents a standard scenario in reactor physics. Therefore, the problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\n**1. Initial Steady-State Conditions ($t < 0$)**\n\nFor $t < 0$, the reactor is at constant power, meaning the neutron density $n(t) = n(0^{-})$ is constant. This is a steady state, so $\\frac{dn}{dt} = 0$ and $\\frac{dC}{dt} = 0$. The reactivity is $\\rho(t) = \\rho_0$.\n\nFrom the precursor balance equation:\n$$ \\frac{dC}{dt} = 0 = \\frac{\\beta_{\\text{eff}}}{\\Lambda}n(0^{-}) - \\lambda C(0^{-}) $$\nThis gives the steady-state relationship between the precursor concentration and neutron density:\n$$ C(0^{-}) = \\frac{\\beta_{\\text{eff}}}{\\lambda \\Lambda} n(0^{-}) $$\n\nSubstituting this and $\\frac{dn}{dt}=0$ into the neutron balance equation:\n$$ \\frac{dn}{dt} = 0 = \\frac{\\rho_0 - \\beta_{\\text{eff}}}{\\Lambda} n(0^{-}) + \\lambda C(0^{-}) $$\n$$ 0 = \\frac{\\rho_0 - \\beta_{\\text{eff}}}{\\Lambda} n(0^{-}) + \\lambda \\left(\\frac{\\beta_{\\text{eff}}}{\\lambda \\Lambda} n(0^{-})\\right) $$\n$$ 0 = \\frac{n(0^{-})}{\\Lambda} (\\rho_0 - \\beta_{\\text{eff}} + \\beta_{\\text{eff}}) $$\nSince $n(0^{-}) \\neq 0$ and $\\Lambda \\neq 0$, it must be that $\\rho_0 = 0$. This confirms that a reactor at constant power is critical, with zero initial reactivity.\n\n**2. Prompt-Jump Approximation ($t=0^+$)**\n\nAt $t=0$, the reactivity undergoes a step change from $\\rho_0=0$ to $\\rho(0^{+}) = \\Delta\\rho$. The dynamic response is governed by two distinct time scales: the prompt neutron generation time $\\Lambda$ (typically $10^{-7}$ to $10^{-4}$ seconds) and the precursor decay time $1/\\lambda$ (typically $0.1$ to $10$ seconds). Since $\\Lambda \\ll 1/\\lambda$, we can separate the time scales.\n\n-   **Precursor Concentration**: The precursor concentration $C(t)$ changes on the slow time scale of $1/\\lambda$. Over the infinitesimal interval from $t=0^{-}$ to $t=0^{+}$, it does not have time to change. Thus, we can state that $C(t)$ is continuous at $t=0$:\n    $$ C(0^{+}) = C(0^{-}) = \\frac{\\beta_{\\text{eff}}}{\\lambda \\Lambda} n(0^{-}) $$\n\n-   **Neutron Density**: The neutron density $n(t)$ responds on the fast time scale $\\Lambda$. The step change in $\\rho$ creates a large imbalance in the neutron balance equation, causing $n(t)$ to \"jump\" to a new value $n(0^{+})$ almost instantaneously. After this jump, the reactor settles onto a new trajectory where the rate of change $\\frac{dn}{dt}$ is finite and governed by the slower precursor dynamics.\n\nLet's rewrite the neutron balance equation as:\n$$ \\Lambda \\frac{dn}{dt} = (\\rho(t) - \\beta_{\\text{eff}})n(t) + \\lambda \\Lambda C(t) $$\nFor the derivative $\\frac{dn}{dt}$ to be finite at $t=0^{+}$ in the limit of a very small $\\Lambda$, the terms on the right-hand side that become very large must nearly cancel each other out. This is the core of the prompt-jump approximation. It effectively means that the neutron population adjusts to a level where the net production of prompt neutrons is balanced by the source of delayed neutrons. The mathematical approximation is to set the LHS to zero in the limit $\\Lambda \\to 0$, but a more physically intuitive approach is to state that the terms that would cause a divergence must balance.\nAt $t=0^{+}$, an approximate quasi-equilibrium is established for the fast dynamics. This is expressed by taking the neutron equation, dividing by $n(t)$, and neglecting the $\\frac{dn/dt}{n(t)}$ term with respect to the terms in $1/\\Lambda$:\n$$ \\frac{\\rho(0^{+}) - \\beta_{\\text{eff}}}{\\Lambda} n(0^{+}) + \\lambda C(0^{+}) \\approx 0 $$\nNow, we substitute $\\rho(0^{+}) = \\Delta\\rho$ and the expression for $C(0^{+})$:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta\\rho - \\beta_{\\text{eff}}}{\\Lambda} n(0^{+}) + \\lambda \\left(\\frac{\\beta_{\\text{eff}}}{\\lambda \\Lambda} n(0^{-})\\right) = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta\\rho - \\beta_{\\text{eff}}}{\\Lambda} n(0^{+}) + \\frac{\\beta_{\\text{eff}}}{\\Lambda} n(0^{-}) = 0 $$\nMultiplying the entire equation by $\\Lambda$ (which is non-zero):\n$$ (\\Delta\\rho - \\beta_{\\text{eff}}) n(0^{+}) + \\beta_{\\text{eff}} n(0^{-}) = 0 $$\nRearranging to solve for the ratio $n(0^{+})/n(0^{-})$:\n$$ \\beta_{\\text{eff}} n(0^{-}) = -(\\Delta\\rho - \\beta_{\\text{eff}}) n(0^{+}) $$\n$$ \\beta_{\\text{eff}} n(0^{-}) = (\\beta_{\\text{eff}} - \\Delta\\rho) n(0^{+}) $$\n$$ \\frac{n(0^{+})}{n(0^{-})} = \\frac{\\beta_{\\text{eff}}}{\\beta_{\\text{eff}} - \\Delta\\rho} $$\nThis is the analytic expression for the prompt-jump factor. The condition $\\Delta \\rho < \\beta_{\\text{eff}}$ ensures the denominator is positive, yielding a physically sensible positive jump in neutron density.\n\n**3. Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are given:\n-   $\\beta_{\\text{eff}} = 6.5 \\times 10^{-3}$\n-   $\\Delta\\rho = 1.5 \\times 10^{-3}$\n-   $n(0^{-}) = 2.00 \\times 10^{12}$ neutrons/cm$^3$\n\nFirst, calculate the prompt-jump factor:\n$$ \\frac{n(0^{+})}{n(0^{-})} = \\frac{6.5 \\times 10^{-3}}{6.5 \\times 10^{-3} - 1.5 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{6.5 \\times 10^{-3}}{5.0 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{6.5}{5.0} = 1.3 $$\nNow, compute the final neutron density $n(0^{+})$:\n$$ n(0^{+}) = 1.3 \\times n(0^{-}) = 1.3 \\times (2.00 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ cm}^{-3}) $$\n$$ n(0^{+}) = 2.6 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ cm}^{-3} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in scientific notation and rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ n(0^{+}) = 2.600 \\times 10^{12} \\text{ cm}^{-3} $$",

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the change in integral control rod worth, $\\Delta W$, when the absorber material is changed from Boron Carbide ($\\text{B}_4\\text{C}$) to Hafnium ($\\text{Hf}$). This change, $\\Delta W = W_{\\text{Hf}} - W_{\\text{B}_4\\text{C}}$, can be calculated using first-order perturbation theory.\n\nFirst-order perturbation theory provides an expression for the change in reactivity, $\\rho = \\frac{\\Delta k}{k}$, due to a small perturbation in the system. For a perturbation caused by a change in macroscopic cross sections, the reactivity change is given by:\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{\\langle \\phi^{+}, (-\\Delta\\hat{L} + \\frac{1}{k}\\Delta\\hat{F}) \\phi \\rangle}{\\langle \\phi^{+}, \\frac{1}{k}\\hat{F}' \\phi' \\rangle}\n$$\nwhere $\\phi$ and $\\phi^{+}$ are the forward and adjoint fluxes of the unperturbed system, $\\hat{L}$ is the net loss operator (absorption and scattering-out), and $\\hat{F}$ is the production operator. The primes denote the perturbed state. For small perturbations, we can approximate the denominator using the unperturbed state quantities, and the problem explicitly states to use a fixed spectrum and shape.\n\nThe perturbation in this problem is a material replacement within the control rod region, $V_{\\mathrm{rod}}$. This replacement only affects the absorption cross section, $\\Sigma_a$. Thus, the change in the loss operator is $\\Delta \\hat{L} = \\Delta \\Sigma_a$, and the change in the production operator is $\\Delta \\hat{F} = 0$.

Change in fuel temperature from $T_{f,\\text{ref}}$ to $T_f$.\n\nThe total reactivity in the final state is given by the expression:\n$$ \\rho_{\\text{total}} = \\rho_{\\text{ref}} + \\Delta\\rho_{\\text{rods}} + \\Delta\\rho_{\\text{boron}} + \\Delta\\rho_{\\text{moderator}} + \\Delta\\rho_{\\text{fuel}} $$\nSince $\\rho_{\\text{ref}}=0$, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\rho_{\\text{total}} = \\Delta\\rho_{\\text{rods}} + \\Delta\\rho_{\\text{boron}} + \\Delta\\rho_{\\text{moderator}} + \\Delta\\rho_{\\text{fuel}} $$\n\nWe now derive each component of the total reactivity change.\n\n**1. Control Rod Reactivity, $\\Delta\\rho_{\\text{rods}}$**\nThe total rod reactivity is the sum of the worths of the individual rods in the SDM configuration. In this configuration, rods $1$ and $2$ are fully inserted ($x=H$) and rod $S$ is fully withdrawn ($x=0$).\nThe worth of a fully inserted rod ($x=H$, so $x/H=1$) is:\n$$ W_i(H) = -W_i^{\\max}\\,[3(1)^2 - 2(1)^3] = -W_i^{\\max}\\,(3 - 2) = -W_i^{\\max} $$\nThe worth of a fully withdrawn rod ($x=0$, so $x/H=0$) is:\n$$ W_i(0) = -W_i^{\\max}\\,[3(0)^2 - 2(0)^3] = 0 $$\nThe total rod reactivity is therefore:\n$$ \\Delta\\rho_{\\text{rods}} = W_1(H) + W_2(H) + W_S(0) = -W_1^{\\max} - W_2^{\\max} + 0 = -(W_1^{\\max} + W_2^{\\max}) $$\n\n**2. Soluble Boron Reactivity, $\\Delta\\rho_{\\text{boron}}$**\nThe change in reactivity due to the change in boron concentration is given by the product of the boron coefficient and the concentration change:\n$$ \\Delta\\rho_{\\text{boron}} = \\alpha_B \\, (C - C_{\\text{ref}}) $$\n\n**3. Moderator Temperature Reactivity, $\\Delta\\rho_{\\text{moderator}}$**\nThe change in reactivity due to the change in moderator temperature is:\n$$ \\Delta\\rho_{\\text{moderator}} = \\alpha_M \\, (T_m - T_{m,\\text{ref}}) $$\n\n**4. Fuel Temperature Reactivity, $\\Delta\\rho_{\\text{fuel}}$**\nThe change in reactivity due to the change in fuel temperature (Doppler effect) is:\n$$ \\Delta\\rho_{\\text{fuel}} = \\alpha_F \\, (T_f - T_{f,\\text{ref}}) $$\n\nCombining these terms, the explicit expression for the total reactivity in the stuck-rod SDM configuration is:\n$$ \\rho_{\\text{total}} = -(W_1^{\\max} + W_2^{\\max}) + \\alpha_B (C - C_{\\text{ref}}) + \\alpha_M (T_m - T_{m,\\text{ref}}) + \\alpha_F (T_f - T_{f,\\text{ref}}) $$\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression. All reactivity values are in units of pcm (percent-mille, $10^{-5}\\Delta k/k$).\n- $W_1^{\\max} = 900$ pcm\n- $W_2^{\\max} = 1400$ pcm\n- $\\alpha_B = -7.0$ pcm/ppm\n- $\\alpha_M = -5.0$ pcm/K\n- $\\alpha_F = -2.0$ pcm/K\n- $C = 800$ ppm, $C_{\\text{ref}} = 900$ ppm $\\implies \\Delta C = 800 - 900 = -100$ ppm\n- $T_m = 580$ K, $T_{m,\\text{ref}} = 560$ K $\\implies \\Delta T_m = 580 - 560 = 20$ K\n- $T_f = 580$ K, $T_{f,\\text{ref}} = 560$ K $\\implies \\Delta T_f = 580 - 560 = 20$ K\n\nCalculating each contribution:\n$$ \\Delta\\rho_{\\text{rods}} = -(900 + 1400) = -2300 \\text{ pcm} $$\n$$ \\Delta\\rho_{\\text{boron}} = (-7.0) \\times (-100) = +700 \\text{ pcm} $$\n$$ \\Delta\\rho_{\\text{moderator}} = (-5.0) \\times (20) = -100 \\text{ pcm} $$\n$$ \\Delta\\rho_{\\text{fuel}} = (-2.0) \\times (20) = -40 \\text{ pcm} $$\n\nThe total reactivity is the sum of these contributions:\n$$ \\rho_{\\text{total}} = -2300 + 700 - 100 - 40 = -1740 \\text{ pcm} $$\nThe total reactivity in the specified shutdown configuration is $-1740$ pcm. This negative value indicates that the reactor is subcritical, as expected for a shutdown state.\n\nThe shutdown margin (SDM) is defined in the problem as the positive magnitude of the total core reactivity.\n$$ \\text{SDM} = |\\rho_{\\text{total}}| = |-1740| = 1740 \\text{ pcm} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is exactly $1740$. To express this with four significant figures, we use scientific notation.\n$$ \\text{SDM} = 1.740 \\times 10^3 \\text{ pcm} $$\nThis satisfies the precision requirement.",
