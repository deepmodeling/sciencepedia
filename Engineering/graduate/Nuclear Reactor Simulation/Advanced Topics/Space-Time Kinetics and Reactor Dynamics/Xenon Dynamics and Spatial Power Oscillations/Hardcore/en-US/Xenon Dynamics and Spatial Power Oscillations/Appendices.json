            "solution": "The problem requires a linear stability analysis of a reduced-order model for axial xenon oscillations in a nuclear reactor core. The state of the system is described by a vector $\\mathbf{y}(t) = [I(t), X(t), a(t)]^T$, where $I(t)$ is the modal amplitude of iodine-135 concentration, $X(t)$ is the modal amplitude of xenon-135 concentration, and $a(t)$ is the modal amplitude of the neutron flux perturbation. The dynamics are governed by a system of linear ordinary differential equations, $\\dot{\\mathbf{y}} = \\mathbf{J} \\mathbf{y}$, where $\\mathbf{J}$ is the Jacobian matrix.\n\nThe Jacobian matrix $\\mathbf{J}$ is given by:\n$$\n\\mathbf{J} =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n-\\lambda_I & 0 & s_I \\\\\n\\lambda_I & -(\\lambda_X + R_X) & -r_b \\\\\n0 & k_x & -(k_l - k_p)\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nThe stability of the system is determined by the eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of $\\mathbf{J}$. The general solution is a linear combination of terms of the form $\\mathbf{v} e^{\\lambda t}$, where $\\mathbf{v}$ is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue $\\lambda$. The system is unstable if any eigenvalue has a positive real part, as this leads to exponential growth of the corresponding mode.\n\nThe analysis proceeds with the following steps for each of the four specified cases:\n\n1.  **Define Constants**: The physical constants are specified in units of $\\mathrm{hour}^{-1}$:\n    *   Iodine-135 decay constant: $\\lambda_I = \\ln(2)/6.57 \\approx 0.105498 \\, \\mathrm{hour}^{-1}$\n    *   Xenon-135 decay constant: $\\lambda_X = \\ln(2)/9.14 \\approx 0.075837 \\, \\mathrm{hour}^{-1}$\n    *   Effective xenon removal rate: $R_X = 0.30 \\, \\mathrm{hour}^{-1}$\n\n2.  **Define Mode-Coupling Coefficients**: The coefficients for the first axial mode are given in units of $\\mathrm{hour}^{-1}$:\n    *   Fission iodine production sensitivity: $s_I = 0.15 \\, \\mathrm{hour}^{-1}$\n    *   Xenon flux-removal sensitivity: $r_b = 0.10 \\, \\mathrm{hour}^{-1}$\n    *   Reactivity sensitivity to xenon: $k_x = 0.08 \\, \\mathrm{hour}^{-1}$\n    *   The baseline leakage damping is $k_l = 0.06 \\, \\mathrm{hour}^{-1}$.\n\n3.  **Construct Jacobian Matrix for Each Case**: For each of the four cases (A, B, C, D), the specific values of the BP-layout-induced modal coupling coefficient $k_p$ and the net leakage/absorber damping $k_l$ are used to construct the corresponding Jacobian matrix $\\mathbf{J}$.\n    *   **Case A**: $k_p = 0.02 \\, \\mathrm{hour}^{-1}$, $k_l = 0.06 \\, \\mathrm{hour}^{-1} \\implies -(k_l - k_p) = -0.04$\n    *   **Case B**: $k_p = 0.00 \\, \\mathrm{hour}^{-1}$, $k_l = 0.06 \\, \\mathrm{hour}^{-1} \\implies -(k_l - k_p) = -0.06$\n    *   **Case C**: $k_p = 0.05 \\, \\mathrm{hour}^{-1}$, $k_l = 0.06 \\, \\mathrm{hour}^{-1} \\implies -(k_l - k_p) = -0.01$\n    *   **Case D**: $k_p = 0.00 \\, \\mathrm{hour}^{-1}$, $k_l = 0.50 \\, \\mathrm{hour}^{-1} \\implies -(k_l - k_p) = -0.50$\n\n4.  **Compute Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**: For each matrix $\\mathbf{J}$, the eigenvalues $\\lambda_i$ and corresponding right eigenvectors $\\mathbf{v}_i$ are found by solving the eigenvalue problem $\\mathbf{J}\\mathbf{v}_i = \\lambda_i \\mathbf{v}_i$.\n\n5.  **Determine Dominant Growth Rate**: The dominant growth rate, $g$, is the largest real part among all eigenvalues: $g = \\max_{i} \\{\\text{Re}(\\lambda_i)\\}$. A positive $g$ indicates an unstable, growing oscillation, while a negative $g$ indicates a stable, decaying oscillation.\n\n6.  **Calculate Xenon-to-Flux Amplitude Ratio**: The eigenvector $\\mathbf{v}_{\\text{dom}} = [v_I, v_X, v_a]^T$ associated with the dominant eigenvalue $\\lambda_{\\text{dom}}$ describes the relative amplitudes and phases of the iodine, xenon, and flux oscillations for that mode. The requested xenon-to-flux amplitude ratio is $r = X/a$, which is calculated from the components of $\\mathbf{v}_{\\text{dom}}$.\n    *   If the dominant eigenvalue is real, its eigenvector can be chosen to be real, and the ratio is simply $r = v_X / v_a$.\n    *   If the dominant eigenvalue is part of a complex conjugate pair, its eigenvector will be complex. As per the problem's instruction, the ratio is calculated as $r = \\text{Re}(v_X) / \\text{Re}(v_a)$. This is valid as long as the denominator $\\text{Re}(v_a)$ is not close to zero. If it were, the ratio of magnitudes, $r = |v_X| / |v_a|$, would be used. In the given cases, the denominator is not near zero when the eigenvector is complex.\n\n7.  **Final Output Formulation**: The calculated growth rate $g$ and ratio $r$ for each case are rounded to six decimal places and formatted into the specified list structure.\n\nThe following Python program implements this procedure using the `numpy` library for the numerical linear algebra computations.",
