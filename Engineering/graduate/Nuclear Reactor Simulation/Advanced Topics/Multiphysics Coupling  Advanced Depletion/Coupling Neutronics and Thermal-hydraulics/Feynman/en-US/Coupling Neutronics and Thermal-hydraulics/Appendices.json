            "problem": "A spatially lumped reactor node is initially at steady state with fuel temperature $T_0$ and neutron population corresponding to zero net reactivity at the nominal operating condition. The local fuel temperature coefficient of reactivity is defined at the nominal condition as the derivative $\\alpha_T \\equiv \\left.\\frac{d \\rho}{d T}\\right|_{T_0}$, where $\\rho$ is the dimensionless reactivity and $T$ is the fuel temperature.

The definition of the temperature coefficient of reactivity and its application via linearization are standard textbook procedures. The numerical value for $\\alpha_T$ is realistic for light-water moderated reactors.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined. It provides all necessary data ($\\alpha_T$, $\\Delta T$) and a key modeling assumption (first-order approximation is valid) to determine a unique numerical answer for the change in reactivity. The qualitative part is also well-posed, asking for an explanation based on the established framework of the point kinetics equations.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased technical language. It is free of ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. It satisfies all criteria for a valid scientific problem. A solution will be formulated.\n\n***\n\nThe core of the problem lies in the application of a first-order Taylor series expansion to approximate the change in a function given a small perturbation in its independent variable. Here, the function is the reactivity $\\rho$, and the independent variable is the fuel temperature $T$.\n\nThe problem states that the functional dependence $\\rho(T)$ is smooth in a neighborhood of the initial steady-state temperature $T_0$. This allows us to express the reactivity $\\rho$ at a new temperature $T = T_0 + \\Delta T$ using a Taylor expansion around $T_0$:\n$$\n\\rho(T) = \\rho(T_0) + \\left.\\frac{d\\rho}{dT}\\right|_{T_0}(T - T_0) + \\frac{1}{2!}\\left.\\frac{d^2\\rho}{dT^2}\\right|_{T_0}(T - T_0)^2 + \\dots\n$$\nThe problem specifies that a first-order approximation is valid. This means we can neglect terms of the second order and higher. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\rho(T) \\approx \\rho(T_0) + \\left.\\frac{d\\rho}{dT}\\right|_{T_0}(T - T_0)\n$$\nThe change in reactivity, $\\Delta \\rho$, is defined as the difference between the new reactivity $\\rho(T)$ and the initial reactivity $\\rho(T_0)$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\rho = \\rho(T) - \\rho(T_0)\n$$\nSubstituting the first-order approximation for $\\rho(T)$, we get:\n$$\n\\Delta \\rho \\approx \\left( \\rho(T_0) + \\left.\\frac{d\\rho}{dT}\\right|_{T_0}(T - T_0) \\right) - \\rho(T_0)\n$$\nThis simplifies to the expression for the first-order change in reactivity:\n$$\n\\Delta \\rho \\approx \\left.\\frac{d\\rho}{dT}\\right|_{T_0}(T - T_0)\n$$\nThe problem provides the definitions for the terms on the right-hand side. The temperature coefficient of reactivity is $\\alpha_T \\equiv \\left.\\frac{d\\rho}{dT}\\right|_{T_0}$, and the change in temperature is $\\Delta T = T - T_0$. Thus, the derived expression is:\n$$\n\\Delta \\rho \\approx \\alpha_T \\Delta T\n$$\nNow, we compute the numerical value using the given data:\n$\\alpha_T = -3.62 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$ and $\\Delta T = 50\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n$$\n\\Delta \\rho \\approx (-3.62 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}) \\times (50\\ \\mathrm{K})\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta \\rho \\approx -181 \\times 10^{-5}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta \\rho \\approx -0.00181\n$$\nThis value is dimensionless, as required for reactivity. The result has three significant figures, consistent with the precision of the input $\\alpha_T$.\n\nNext, we address the qualitative explanation. The computed change in reactivity, $\\Delta \\rho \\approx -0.00181$, is negative. This is a negative reactivity insertion into the reactor core. The dynamic behavior of the total neutron population, $N(t)$, and thus the reactor power, is governed by the point kinetics equations (PKE). A simplified form of the PKE for the neutron population is:\n$$\n\\frac{dN}{dt} = \\frac{\\rho(t) - \\beta}{\\Lambda}N(t) + \\sum_{i=1}^{M} \\lambda_i C_i(t)\n$$\nwhere $\\beta$ is the total delayed neutron fraction, $\\Lambda$ is the prompt neutron generation time, $\\lambda_i$ are the decay constants for the delayed neutron precursors, and $C_i(t)$ are the concentrations of these precursors.\n\nInitially, the reactor is at steady state, so $\\rho = 0$ and $\\frac{dN}{dt} = 0$. The temperature perturbation introduces a negative reactivity, $\\rho = \\Delta \\rho = -0.00181$. The term $\\frac{\\rho(t) - \\beta}{\\Lambda}$ in the PKE immediately becomes more negative. This causes the time derivative of the neutron population, $\\frac{dN}{dt}$, to become negative. Consequently, the neutron population, and thus the reactor power, will immediately begin to decrease.\n\nThe role of the temperature–reactivity coupling in this scenario is that of a negative feedback mechanism. This is a critical feature for inherent reactor safety. The sequence of events is as follows:\n1.  A thermal perturbation causes the fuel temperature to increase ($\\Delta T > 0$).\n2.  The negative temperature coefficient of reactivity ($\\alpha_T  0$) couples this temperature change to the neutronics, inducing a negative reactivity change ($\\Delta \\rho  0$).\n3.  This negative reactivity causes the fission rate and reactor power to decrease.\n4.  The reduction in power leads to less heat being generated in the fuel, which counteracts the initial temperature increase, thus stabilizing the reactor.\nThis self-regulating behavior ensures that a transient increase in temperature is met with a response that naturally drives the system back toward a stable, lower-power state, preventing an uncontrolled power excursion. This is a fundamental principle of passive safety in reactor design.",

We start by applying the First Law of Thermodynamics to a differential control volume of the coolant.\n\nConsider a differential control volume, $CV$, of the coolant fluid. This $CV$ is a thin slice of the channel oriented perpendicular to the flow direction, located at an axial position $z$ with a thickness $dz$. The volume of this element is $dV = A_c dz$, where $A_c$ is the constant flow area.\n\nThe problem is stated to be at steady state, and we are instructed to neglect changes in kinetic and potential energy. The steady-flow energy equation for this open system (control volume) simplifies to a balance of enthalpy transport by convection and heat addition.\n\nThe rate of energy entering the control volume consists of two terms:\n$1$. The rate of enthalpy advected into the $CV$ at position $z$: $\\dot{m} h(z)$, where $\\dot{m}$ is the constant mass flow rate and $h(z)$ is the specific enthalpy of the coolant at $z$.\n$2$. The rate of heat added to the coolant within the $CV$. The problem provides an effective uniform volumetric heat addition rate, $q'''$. Thus, the heat rate added to the differential volume is $q''' dV = q''' A_c dz$.\n\nThe rate of energy leaving the control volume is the rate of enthalpy advected out of the $CV$ at position $z+dz$: $\\dot{m} h(z+dz)$.\n\nAt steady state, the energy balance is:\n$$(\\text{Rate of energy in}) = (\\text{Rate of energy out})$$\n$$\\dot{m} h(z) + q''' A_c dz = \\dot{m} h(z+dz)$$\n\nRearranging this equation to isolate the change in enthalpy:\n$$\\dot{m} [h(z+dz) - h(z)] = q''' A_c dz$$\n\nDividing by the differential length $dz$:\n$$\\dot{m} \\frac{h(z+dz) - h(z)}{dz} = q''' A_c$$\n\nTaking the limit as $dz \\to 0$, the term on the left becomes the derivative of enthalpy with respect to position $z$:\n$$\\dot{m} \\frac{dh}{dz} = q''' A_c$$\n\nFor a single-phase fluid with constant specific heat, $c_p$, the differential change in specific enthalpy, $dh$, is related to the differential change in temperature, $dT$, by the relation $dh = c_p dT$. Substituting this into the energy equation:\n$$\\dot{m} c_p \\frac{dT}{dz} = q''' A_c$$\n\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation for the coolant temperature $T$ as a function of axial position $z$. Since $q'''$, $A_c$, $\\dot{m}$, and $c_p$ are all constants, the rate of temperature increase along the channel is constant. We can solve this equation by separating variables and integrating along the entire length of the channel, from the inlet at $z=0$ to the outlet at $z=L$. The corresponding temperatures are $T(0) = T_{\\mathrm{in}}$ and $T(L) = T_{\\mathrm{out}}$.\n\n$$dT = \\left( \\frac{q''' A_c}{\\dot{m} c_p} \\right) dz$$\n\n$$\\int_{T_{\\mathrm{in}}}^{T_{\\mathrm{out}}} dT = \\int_{0}^{L} \\frac{q''' A_c}{\\dot{m} c_p} dz$$\n\nSince the term $\\frac{q''' A_c}{\\dot{m} c_p}$ is a constant, we can take it out of the integral:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{out}} - T_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\frac{q''' A_c}{\\dot{m} c_p} \\int_{0}^{L} dz$$\n\nPerforming the integration gives:\n$$T_{\\mathrm{out}} - T_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\frac{q''' A_c}{\\dot{m} c_p} [z]_{0}^{L}$$\n$$\\Delta T = \\frac{q''' A_c L}{\\dot{m} c_p}$$\n\nThis expression represents the total temperature rise of the coolant over the channel length $L$.

We can perform the calculation with scaled power densities $\\tilde{p}_i = p_i / (10^6 \\ \\mathrm{W/m}^3)$ and $\\tilde{P}_J = P_J / (10^6 \\ \\mathrm{W/m}^3)$.\n\nNumerator term, $\\mathcal{N} = \\sum_{i=1}^6 (\\tilde{p}_i - \\tilde{p}'_i)^2 V_i$:\n- For $i=1$: $(9.5 - 10.1)^2 \\times 0.4 = (-0.6)^2 \\times 0.4 = 0.36 \\times 0.4 = 0.144$.\n- For $i=2$: $(10.5 - 10.1)^2 \\times 0.6 = (0.4)^2 \\times 0.6 = 0.16 \\times 0.6 = 0.096$.\n- For $i=3$: $(12.0 - \\frac{14.05}{1.2})^2 \\times 0.5 = (\\frac{14.4 - 14.05}{1.2})^2 \\times 0.5 = (\\frac{0.35}{1.2})^2 \\times 0.5 = (\\frac{35}{120})^2 \\times 0.5 = (\\frac{7}{24})^2 \\times 0.5 = \\frac{49}{576} \\times 0.5 = \\frac{49}{1152}$.\n- For $i=4$: $(11.5 - \\frac{14.05}{1.2})^2 \\times 0.7 = (\\frac{13.8 - 14.05}{1.2})^2 \\times 0.7 = (\\frac{-0.25}{1.2})^2 \\times 0.7 = (\\frac{-25}{120})^2 \\times 0.7 = (\\frac{-5}{24})^2 \\times 0.7 = \\frac{25}{576} \\times 0.7 = \\frac{17.5}{576} = \\frac{35}{1152}$.\n- For $i=5$: $(10.0 - 9.625)^2 \\times 0.5 = (0.375)^2 \\times 0.5 = 0.140625 \\times 0.5 = 0.0703125 = \\frac{9}{128}$.\n- For $i=6$: $(9.0 - 9.625)^2 \\times 0.3 = (-0.625)^2 \\times 0.3 = 0.390625 \\times 0.3 = 0.1171875 = \\frac{15}{128}$.\n\nSumming the terms for the numerator:\n$$ \\mathcal{N} = 0.144 + 0.096 + \\frac{49}{1152} + \\frac{35}{1152} + \\frac{9}{128} + \\frac{15}{128} $$\n$$ \\mathcal{N} = 0.24 + \\frac{84}{1152} + \\frac{24}{128} = \\frac{24}{100} + \\frac{7}{96} + \\frac{3}{16} = \\frac{6}{25} + \\frac{7}{96} + \\frac{18}{96} = \\frac{6}{25} + \\frac{25}{96} $$\n$$ \\mathcal{N} = \\frac{6 \\times 96 + 25 \\times 25}{25 \\times 96} = \\frac{576 + 625}{2400} = \\frac{1201}{2400} $$\nSo $\\mathcal{N} \\approx 0.50041667$.\n\nDenominator term, $\\mathcal{D} = \\sum_{i=1}^6 \\tilde{p}_i^2 V_i$:\n- For $i=1$: $(9.5)^2 \\times 0.4 = 90.25 \\times 0.4 = 36.1$.\n- For $i=2$: $(10.5)^2 \\times 0.6 = 110.25 \\times 0.6 = 66.15$.\n- For $i=3$: $(12.0)^2 \\times 0.5 = 144.0 \\times 0.5 = 72.0$.\n- For $i=4$: $(11.5)^2 \\times 0.7 = 132.25 \\times 0.7 = 92.575$.\n- For $i=5$: $(10.0)^2 \\times 0.5 = 100.0 \\times 0.5 = 50.0$.\n- For $i=6$: $(9.0)^2 \\times 0.3 = 81.0 \\times 0.3 = 24.3$.\n\nSumming the terms for the denominator:\n$$ \\mathcal{D} = 36.1 + 66.15 + 72.0 + 92.575 + 50.0 + 24.3 = 341.125 $$\n\nFinally, we compute the error $\\epsilon$:\n$$ \\epsilon = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mathcal{N}}{\\mathcal{D}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1201/2400}{341.125}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{0.50041666...}{341.125}} \\approx \\sqrt{0.0014669598} $$\n$$ \\epsilon \\approx 0.038300911 $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.03830$.
