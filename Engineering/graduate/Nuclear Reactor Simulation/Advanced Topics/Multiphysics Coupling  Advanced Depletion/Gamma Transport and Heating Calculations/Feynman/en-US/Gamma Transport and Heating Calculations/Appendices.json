            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the change in the macroscopic attenuation coefficient, $\\Delta \\Sigma$, for a monoenergetic gamma-ray beam in lead as the photon energy crosses the K-shell absorption edge.\n\nThe macroscopic attenuation coefficient, $\\Sigma(E)$, which appears in the Beer–Lambert law $dI = -I \\Sigma(E) dx$, is related to the microscopic total cross section per atom, $\\sigma_{\\text{tot}}(E)$, and the atom number density of the material, $N$, by the fundamental relationship:\n$$\n\\Sigma(E) = N \\sigma_{\\text{tot}}(E)\n$$\nThe atom number density $N$ (number of atoms per unit volume) can be determined from the material's mass density $\\rho$, molar mass $M$, and Avogadro's constant $N_A$ using the formula:\n$$\nN = \\frac{\\rho N_A}{M}\n$$\nThe quantity to be computed is the change in the macroscopic attenuation coefficient, $\\Delta \\Sigma$, across the K-edge. This is defined as the difference between its value at an energy $E^{+}$ just above the edge and its value at an energy $E^{-}$ just below the edge:\n$$\n\\Delta \\Sigma = \\Sigma(E^{+}) - \\Sigma(E^{-})\n$$\nBy substituting the expression for $\\Sigma(E)$, we can write $\\Delta \\Sigma$ in terms of the microscopic cross sections:\n$$\n\\Delta \\Sigma = N \\sigma_{\\text{tot}}(E^{+}) - N \\sigma_{\\text{tot}}(E^{-}) = N \\left( \\sigma_{\\text{tot}}(E^{+}) - \\sigma_{\\text{tot}}(E^{-}) \\right)\n$$\nThe total microscopic cross section, $\\sigma_{\\text{tot}}(E)$, is the sum of the cross sections for all possible photon interactions. For photons with energy around $88\\,\\mathrm{keV}$, the primary interactions are the photoelectric effect ($\\sigma_{\\text{pe}}$), Rayleigh (coherent) scattering ($\\sigma_{\\text{Rayleigh}}$), and Compton (incoherent) scattering ($\\sigma_{\\text{Compton}}$). Pair production is energetically forbidden as the photon energy is much less than the threshold of $2m_e c^2 \\approx 1.022\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$. Thus, the total cross section is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\text{tot}}(E) = \\sigma_{\\text{pe}}(E) + \\sigma_{\\text{Rayleigh}}(E) + \\sigma_{\\text{Compton}}(E)\n$$\nThe problem states that the scattering contributions (Rayleigh and Compton) vary smoothly with energy across the narrow interval $[87.9, 88.1]\\,\\mathrm{keV}$.

Maximum Compton Electron Kinetic Energy ($T_{\\max}$)**\n\nThe kinetic energy, $T_e$, transferred to a recoil electron in a Compton scattering event is the difference between the incident photon energy, $E_{\\gamma}$, and the scattered photon energy, $E'_{\\gamma}$. From the kinematics of Compton scattering, the scattered photon energy is given by:\n$$ E'_{\\gamma} = \\frac{E_{\\gamma}}{1 + \\alpha(1 - \\cos\\theta)} $$\nwhere $\\theta$ is the scattering angle of the photon, and $\\alpha$ is the incident photon energy in units of electron rest mass energy, $\\alpha = E_{\\gamma} / (m_e c^2)$. The electron rest mass energy is $m_e c^2 \\approx 0.511\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$.\n\nThe kinetic energy of the electron is $T_e = E_{\\gamma} - E'_{\\gamma}$.

Geometric Range ($R_{\\ell}$)**\n\nThe geometric range, $R_{\\ell}$, is related to the mass thickness range, $R_{\\mathrm{mass}}$, by the material's mass density, $\\rho$:\n$$ R_{\\ell} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{mass}}}{\\rho} $$\nUsing the given density $\\rho = 7.9\\,\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{cm}^3$:\n$$ R_{\\ell} = \\frac{0.383156\\,\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{cm}^2}{7.9\\,\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{cm}^3} \\approx 0.048501\\,\\mathrm{cm} $$\nThe problem requires the answer in millimeters ($\\mathrm{mm}$).

Discussion of Charged Particle Equilibrium (CPE)**\n\nCharged Particle Equilibrium (CPE) is a condition that exists at a point within a medium irradiated by uncharged particles (like photons) if the flux of secondary charged particles (electrons) is uniform throughout a region surrounding that point with a radius at least equal to the maximum range of the secondaries. In practice, this means that for every charged particle leaving a small volume, another charged particle of the same type and energy enters it. This condition allows for the simplification that the absorbed dose is equal to the kerma.\n\nFor CPE to be established, the irradiated medium must be an effectively infinite, homogeneous medium. For a finite slab of thickness $L$, CPE can be considered to hold approximately in a central region, provided the slab is much thicker than the maximum range of the secondary electrons, i.e., $L \\gg R_{\\ell}$.\n\nIn this problem, the slab thickness is $L = 1.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and the calculated maximum electron range is $R_{\\ell} \\approx 0.485\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\nWe must compare $L$ to $R_{\\ell}$. Here, the thickness $L$ is approximately $2R_{\\ell}$. This is not sufficiently large to satisfy the condition $L \\gg R_{\\ell}$. Consequently, CPE is not expected to hold throughout the slab.\n\nSpecifically, CPE breaks down near the boundaries:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item **Entrance Surface ($z=0$):** Within a depth of approximately $R_{\\ell}$ from the surface where the gamma rays impinge, there is a \"dose build-up\" region. Electrons are set in motion in the forward direction, but there is no material upstream (for $z0$) to produce electrons that would travel into this region to establish equilibrium. The energy deposited increases with depth until a transient equilibrium is reached at a depth comparable to $R_{\\ell}$.\n    \\item **Exit Surface ($z=L$):** Within a distance of approximately $R_{\\ell}$ from the exit surface, electrons generated can escape the slab. There is no downstream material (for $z>L$) to produce electrons that scatter back into this region. This loss of forward-moving electrons, uncompensated by back-scattered ones, causes the deposited energy to fall off as the exit surface is approached.\n\\end{itemize}\nBecause the slab thickness ($1.0\\,\\mathrm{mm}$) is only about twice the maximum electron range ($0.485\\,\\mathrm{mm}$), the build-up region from the front and the fall-off region from the back effectively span the entire slab thickness. There is no significant central region where CPE can be considered established. The failure to account for electron escape near boundaries in gamma heating calculations would lead to an incorrect estimation of the energy deposition profile, typically overestimating the dose at the surfaces by assuming it equals the local kerma.\n\nThe value to be reported is the CSDA geometric range $R_{\\ell}$, rounded to three significant figures.\n$R_{\\ell} = 0.485\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the slab-averaged volumetric heating rate due to pair production events from an incident gamma-ray beam. The solution involves several steps: calculating material properties, deriving the absorption fraction of annihilation photons, setting up the heating rate equation, and performing a numerical integration.\n\n**Step 1: Calculation of Macroscopic Cross Sections and Energy Constants**\n\nThe problem provides material properties in non-SI units which must be converted. Macroscopic cross sections, $\\Sigma$ (in $\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$), are related to mass attenuation coefficients, $\\mu/\\rho$ (in $\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{kg}$), and material density, $\\rho$ (in $\\mathrm{kg}/\\mathrm{m}^3$), by the formula $\\Sigma = (\\mu/\\rho) \\rho$.\n\nThe given mass attenuation coefficients are in $\\mathrm{cm}^2/\\mathrm{g}$.

The probability of absorption for a path length $s$ is $1 - e^{-\\Sigma_{511} s}$. We must average this over all possible directions.\nThe direction is specified by the cosine of the angle with the slab normal, $\\mu = \\cos\\theta$. For an isotropic source, the probability distribution of $\\mu$ is uniform over $[-1, 1]$, i.e., $p(\\mu) = 1/2$.\n\nThe path length $s$ depends on $\\mu$:\n*   For $\\mu \\in (0, 1]$ (forward-going), the distance to the back boundary at $x=T$ is $T-x$. The path length is $s = (T-x)/\\mu$.\n*   For $\\mu \\in [-1, 0)$ (backward-going), the distance to the front boundary at $x=0$ is $x$. The path length is $s = x/|\\mu| = x/(-\\mu)$.\n\nThe average absorption fraction is the integral over all directions:\n$$ f_{\\text{abs}}(x) = \\int_{-1}^{1} \\left(1 - e^{-\\Sigma_{511} s(\\mu)}\\right) p(\\mu) \\,d\\mu = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-1}^{1} \\left(1 - e^{-\\Sigma_{511} s(\\mu)}\\right) \\,d\\mu $$\nWe split the integral into two parts:\n$$ f_{\\text{abs}}(x) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\int_{-1}^{0} \\left(1 - e^{-\\Sigma_{511} x/(-\\mu)}\\right) \\,d\\mu + \\int_{0}^{1} \\left(1 - e^{-\\Sigma_{511} (T-x)/\\mu}\\right) \\,d\\mu \\right] $$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$ f_{\\text{abs}}(x) = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\int_{-1}^{0} e^{\\Sigma_{511} x/\\mu} \\,d\\mu + \\int_{0}^{1} e^{-\\Sigma_{511} (T-x)/\\mu} \\,d\\mu \\right] $$\nLet's analyze the integrals. The second integral is of the form $\\int_{0}^{1} e^{-A/\\mu} \\,d\\mu$. With a substitution $t = 1/\\mu$, $d\\mu = -1/t^2 \\,dt$. The limits change from $(0, 1)$ to $(\\infty, 1)$.\n$$ \\int_{\\infty}^{1} e^{-At} \\left(-\\frac{1}{t^2}\\right) \\,dt = \\int_{1}^{\\infty} \\frac{e^{-At}}{t^2} \\,dt $$\nThis is the definition of the second-order exponential integral function, $E_2(A)$. Thus, $\\int_{0}^{1} e^{-A/\\mu} \\,d\\mu = E_2(A)$.\nThe first integral, $\\int_{-1}^{0} e^{\\Sigma_{511} x/\\mu} \\,d\\mu$, can be transformed by letting $\\mu' = -\\mu$, which gives $\\int_{0}^{1} e^{-\\Sigma_{511} x/\\mu'} \\,d\\mu'$, which is $E_2(\\Sigma_{511}x)$.\n\nTherefore, the absorption fraction is:\n$$ f_{\\text{abs}}(x) = 1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ E_2(\\Sigma_{511} x) + E_2(\\Sigma_{511} (T-x)) \\right] $$\nThe function $E_n(z) = \\int_1^\\infty t^{-n} e^{-zt} \\,dt$ is a standard special function, available in numerical libraries like `scipy.special.expn`.\n\n**Step 3: Formulation of the Slab-Averaged Heating Rate, $\\overline{q}_{\\text{pp}}$**\n\nThe volumetric heating rate density at depth $x$ is given by:\n$$ q_{\\text{pp}}(x) = R_{\\text{pp}}(x) \\left[ E_{\\text{ch}} + 2 E_{a} f_{\\text{abs}}(x) \\right] $$\nThe pair production reaction rate density is $R_{\\text{pp}}(x) = \\Sigma_{\\text{pp}} \\phi(x)$, where the uncollided flux at depth $x$ is $\\phi(x) = \\phi_0 e^{-\\Sigma_t x}$. Substituting these into the expression for $q_{\\text{pp}}(x)$:\n$$ q_{\\text{pp}}(x) = \\Sigma_{\\text{pp}} \\phi_0 e^{-\\Sigma_t x} \\left[ E_{\\text{ch}} + 2 E_{a} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ E_2(\\Sigma_{511} x) + E_2(\\Sigma_{511} (T-x)) \\right]\\right) \\right] $$\nAll energies ($E_{\\text{ch}}$, $E_{a}$) must be in Joules to obtain the heating rate in $\\mathrm{W}/\\mathrm{m}^3$.\n\nThe slab-averaged volumetric heating rate is the integral of $q_{\\text{pp}}(x)$ over the slab thickness $T$, divided by $T$:\n$$ \\overline{q}_{\\text{pp}} = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} q_{\\text{pp}}(x) \\,dx $$\nThis integral does not have a simple closed-form analytical solution due to the presence of the exponential integral functions. It must be evaluated numerically. The full expression for the integral is:\n$$ \\overline{q}_{\\text{pp}} = \\frac{\\Sigma_{\\text{pp}} \\phi_0}{T} \\int_{0}^{T} e^{-\\Sigma_t x} \\left[ E_{\\text{ch, J}} + 2 E_{\\text{a, J}} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ E_2(\\Sigma_{511} x) + E_2(\\Sigma_{511} (T-x)) \\right]\\right) \\right] \\,dx $$\n\n**Step 4: Numerical Evaluation**\n\nThe procedure for each test case is as follows:\n1.  Define the input parameters $\\phi_0$ and $T$.\n2.  Use the pre-calculated constants $\\Sigma_t$, $\\Sigma_{\\text{pp}}$, $\\Sigma_{511}$, $E_{\\text{ch, J}}$, and $E_{\\text{a, J}}$.\n3.  Define the integrand function, `integrand(x)`, which computes $q_{\\text{pp}}(x)$ using the formula above, evaluating $E_2(z)$ numerically.\n4.  Use a numerical quadrature routine (e.g., `scipy.integrate.quad`) to compute the definite integral $\\int_{0}^{T} \\text{integrand}(x) \\,dx$.\n5.  Divide the result of the integration by the slab thickness $T$ to find $\\overline{q}_{\\text{pp}}$.\n6.  Format the final result in scientific notation with the specified precision.\n\nThis process is implemented in the provided Python code, which cycles through the four test cases and computes the corresponding average heating rates.",
