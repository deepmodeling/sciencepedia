            "solution": "The problem posed is a well-defined, steady-state heat transfer problem in a cylindrical coordinate system with internal heat generation. It is scientifically sound and all necessary parameters for its solution are provided. We may therefore proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe first objective is to derive the radial temperature field, $T(r)$, within the cylindrical fuel pellet. The governing equation for this physical system is the steady-state heat conduction equation in cylindrical coordinates. For a homogeneous and isotropic material with constant thermal conductivity $k_f$ and uniform volumetric heat generation $q'''$, and assuming only radial temperature variation, the equation simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r \\frac{dT}{dr} \\right) + \\frac{q'''}{k_f} = 0 $$\nThis is an ordinary differential equation for the temperature $T$ as a function of the radial coordinate $r$. We can solve this equation by separating variables and integrating twice. Rearranging the equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r \\frac{dT}{dr} \\right) = -r \\frac{q'''}{k_f} $$\nIntegrating with respect to $r$ yields:\n$$ r \\frac{dT}{dr} = -\\frac{q'''}{2k_f} r^2 + C_1 $$\nwhere $C_1$ is the first integration constant. Dividing by $r$ gives the temperature gradient:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dr} = -\\frac{q'''}{2k_f} r + \\frac{C_1}{r} $$\nTo determine $C_1$, we apply a boundary condition. By the principle of axial symmetry, the temperature gradient at the centerline of the pellet ($r=0$) must be zero. If it were not, there would be a non-physical cusp in the temperature profile, implying an infinite heat source or sink at the axis. Applying this condition, $dT/dr|_{r=0} = 0$:\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{q'''}{2k_f} (0) + \\frac{C_1}{0} $$\nFor the temperature gradient to be finite at $r=0$, the constant $C_1$ must be zero. Thus, the equation for the temperature gradient becomes:\n$$ \\frac{dT}{dr} = -\\frac{q'''}{2k_f} r $$\nIntegrating a second time with respect to $r$ gives the temperature profile:\n$$ T(r) = -\\frac{q'''}{4k_f} r^2 + C_2 $$\nwhere $C_2$ is the second integration constant. We determine $C_2$ using the second boundary condition, which is the specified temperature at the outer surface of the pellet. The problem states that the temperature at $r=R$ is $T_b$. Applying $T(R) = T_b$:\n$$ T_b = -\\frac{q'''}{4k_f} R^2 + C_2 $$\nSolving for $C_2$:\n$$ C_2 = T_b + \\frac{q'''}{4k_f} R^2 $$\nSubstituting this expression for $C_2$ back into the equation for $T(r)$, we obtain the complete radial temperature distribution:\n$$ T(r) = T_b + \\frac{q'''}{4k_f} R^2 - \\frac{q'''}{4k_f} r^2 $$\nThis can be written more compactly as:\n$$ T(r) = T_b + \\frac{q'''}{4k_f} (R^2 - r^2) $$\nThis expression represents a parabolic temperature profile, with its maximum at the centerline and minimum at the outer surface, which is consistent with uniform internal heat generation and surface cooling.\n\nThe second objective is to find the maximum centerline temperature. This occurs at the radial position $r=0$. Substituting $r=0$ into the derived temperature profile equation:\n$$ T_{\\text{centerline}} = T(0) = T_b + \\frac{q'''}{4k_f} (R^2 - 0^2) = T_b + \\frac{q'''R^2}{4k_f} $$\nNow we substitute the given numerical values:\nPellet outer surface temperature, $T_b = 630\\,\\text{K}$.\nVolumetric heat generation rate, $q''' = 300\\,\\text{MW/m}^3 = 300 \\times 10^6\\,\\text{W/m}^3$.\nPellet radius, $R = 4.1 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}$.\nFuel thermal conductivity, $k_f = 2.5\\,\\text{W/m-K}$.\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n$$ T_{\\text{centerline}} = 630\\,\\text{K} + \\frac{(300 \\times 10^6\\,\\text{W/m}^3) (4.1 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m})^2}{4 \\times 2.5\\,\\text{W/m-K}} $$\n$$ T_{\\text{centerline}} = 630\\,\\text{K} + \\frac{(3.0 \\times 10^8) \\times (16.81 \\times 10^{-6})}{10}\\,\\text{K} $$\n$$ T_{\\text{centerline}} = 630\\,\\text{K} + \\frac{5043}{10}\\,\\text{K} $$\n$$ T_{\\text{centerline}} = 630\\,\\text{K} + 504.3\\,\\text{K} $$\n$$ T_{\\text{centerline}} = 1134.3\\,\\text{K} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value is $1134.3$. The fifth significant digit is $3$, so we round down.\n$$ T_{\\text{centerline}} \\approx 1134\\,\\text{K} $$\n\nFor completeness, we assess the tendency for pellet-clad contact. This requires comparing the thermal expansion of the pellet to that of the cladding.\nThe volume-averaged mean fuel temperature, $\\bar{T}_f$, is:\n$$ \\bar{T}_f = \\frac{\\int_0^R T(r) \\, 2\\pi r dr}{\\pi R^2} = T_b + \\frac{q'''R^2}{8k_f} $$\n$$ \\bar{T}_f = 630\\,\\text{K} + \\frac{504.3\\,\\text{K}}{2} = 630\\,\\text{K} + 252.15\\,\\text{K} = 882.15\\,\\text{K} $$\nThe free thermal expansion of the pellet radius, $\\Delta R_f$, from the reference temperature $T_{\\text{ref}} = 300\\,\\text{K}$ is:\n$$ \\Delta R_f = R \\alpha_f (\\bar{T}_f - T_{\\text{ref}}) = (4.1 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m})(1.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{K}^{-1})(882.15\\,\\text{K} - 300\\,\\text{K}) \\approx 2.387 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{m} $$\nThe initial inner radius of the cladding is $R_c = R + g_0 = 4.1 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m} + 50 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m} = 4.15 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}$.\nThe free thermal expansion of the cladding's inner radius, $\\Delta R_c$, is based on its temperature $T_b$:\n$$ \\Delta R_c = R_c \\alpha_c (T_b - T_{\\text{ref}}) = (4.15 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m})(6.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{K}^{-1})(630\\,\\text{K} - 300\\,\\text{K}) \\approx 8.217 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m} $$\nThe change in the radial gap is $\\Delta g = \\Delta R_f - \\Delta R_c \\approx 1.565 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\text{m}$, or $15.65\\,\\mu\\text{m}$. Since $\\Delta R_f > \\Delta R_c$, the pellet expands radially more than the cladding, causing the gap to close by this amount. The initial gap $g_0 = 50\\,\\mu\\text{m}$ is larger than the differential expansion, so hard contact is not predicted under these free-expansion assumptions. However, the greater expansion of the fuel pellet confirms that the thermal field does exacerbate the tendency for pellet-clad contact.\n\nThe problem asks to report only the maximum centerline temperature.",
