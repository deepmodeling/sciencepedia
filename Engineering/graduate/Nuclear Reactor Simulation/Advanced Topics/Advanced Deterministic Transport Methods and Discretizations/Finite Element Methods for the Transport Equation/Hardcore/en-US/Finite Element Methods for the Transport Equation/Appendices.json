In a Continuous Finite Element (CFE) discretization on a tetrahedral mesh, the mapped gradient of a basis function from the reference tetrahedron to a physical tetrahedral element is required to evaluate the directional derivative $\\boldsymbol{\\Omega} \\cdot \\nabla \\varphi$ at quadrature points for assembling the streaming contribution.

This is a standard calculation in the context of the Continuous Finite Element Method (CFEM) for transport problems.\n\nThe directional derivative is constant throughout the element because the basis functions are linear and the mapping from the reference to the physical element is affine. Therefore, the value of the directional derivative will be the same at all four quadrature points, and the arithmetic mean will be equal to this constant value.\n\nThe core of the problem is to compute the physical gradient $\\nabla \\varphi_{1}(\\boldsymbol{x})$ using the chain rule, which relates it to the gradient on the reference element, $\\hat{\\nabla} \\hat{\\varphi}_{1}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}})$. The relationship is given by:\n$$ \\nabla \\varphi_{1}(\\boldsymbol{x}) = (\\mathbf{A}^{-1})^{T} \\hat{\\nabla} \\hat{\\varphi}_{1}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}) $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{A}$ is the Jacobian matrix of the affine mapping $\\boldsymbol{x}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}) = \\boldsymbol{v}_{1} + \\mathbf{A}\\hat{\\boldsymbol{x}}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the gradient of the basis function $\\hat{\\varphi}_{1}$ on the reference element $\\hat{T}$.

The deviation from the average is $\\psi_{h}(\\xi) - a_{0} = a_{1}\\xi$. The limited flux, $\\psi_{h}^{\\text{lim}}(\\xi)$, is then:\n$$ \\psi_{h}^{\\text{lim}}(\\xi) = a_{0} + \\theta (\\psi_{h}(\\xi) - a_{0}) = a_{0} + \\theta(a_{1}\\xi) $$\nThis can be written in the same modal form as the original flux:\n$$ \\psi_{h}^{\\text{lim}}(\\xi) = a_{0}^{\\text{lim}} + a_{1}^{\\text{lim}}\\xi $$\nBy comparing the two expressions for $\\psi_{h}^{\\text{lim}}(\\xi)$, we find the adjusted coefficients:\n$$ a_{0}^{\\text{lim}} = a_{0} $$\n$$ a_{1}^{\\text{lim}} = \\theta a_{1} $$\nThe limiter preserves the cell average, as required.\n\nThe problem requires determining the limiting factor $\\theta$ such that the limited value at the left face, $\\psi_{h}^{\\text{lim}}(-1)$, is exactly equal to the positivity tolerance $\\epsilon = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}$.\nThe value of the limited flux at $\\xi=-1$ is:\n$$ \\psi_{h}^{\\text{lim}}(-1) = a_{0}^{\\text{lim}} + a_{1}^{\\text{lim}}(-1) = a_{0} - \\theta a_{1} $$\nWe set this equal to $\\epsilon$:\n$$ a_{0} - \\theta a_{1} = \\epsilon $$\nSolving for $\\theta$:\n$$ \\theta a_{1} = a_{0} - \\epsilon $$\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{a_{0} - \\epsilon}{a_{1}} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\theta = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-2} - 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}}{1.5 \\times 10^{-2}} = \\frac{0.009999}{0.015} = 0.6666 $$\nSince $0 \\leq 0.6666 \\leq 1$, this is a valid limiting factor.\n\nNow we compute the adjusted coefficients $(a_{0}^{\\text{lim}}, a_{1}^{\\text{lim}})$.\nThe cell average is unchanged:\n$$ a_{0}^{\\text{lim}} = a_{0} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2} $$\nThe adjusted slope coefficient is:\n$$ a_{1}^{\\text{lim}} = \\theta a_{1} = \\left(\\frac{a_{0} - \\epsilon}{a_{1}}\\right) a_{1} = a_{0} - \\epsilon $$\n$$ a_{1}^{\\text{lim}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2} - 1.0 \\times 10^{-6} = 0.009999 $$\n\nFinally, we compute the upwind numerical face flux on the right face of the cell, $\\xi=+1$. For $\\mu_0 > 0$, the upwind flux is determined by the interior trace from the cell $K$, which is the value of the limited solution at the right face boundary.\n$$ F_{K,+} = \\mu_{0}\\,\\psi_{h}^{-}(+1;\\mu_{0}) = \\mu_{0}\\,\\psi_{h}^{\\text{lim}}(+1) $$\nThe value of the limited flux at $\\xi=+1$ is:\n$$ \\psi_{h}^{\\text{lim}}(+1) = a_{0}^{\\text{lim}} + a_{1}^{\\text{lim}}(+1) = a_{0} + (a_{0} - \\epsilon) = 2a_{0} - \\epsilon $$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$ \\psi_{h}^{\\text{lim}}(+1) = 2(1.0 \\times 10^{-2}) - 1.0 \\times 10^{-6} = 0.02 - 0.000001 = 0.019999 $$\nNow, we calculate the flux $F_{K,+}$ using $\\mu_0 = 8.0 \\times 10^{-1} = 0.8$:\n$$ F_{K,+} = (0.8) \\times (0.019999) = 0.0159992 $$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final answers to six significant figures.\n1. $a_{0}^{\\text{lim}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2}$. Rounded to six significant figures, this is $1.00000 \\times 10^{-2}$.\n2. $a_{1}^{\\text{lim}} = 0.009999$. Rounded to six significant figures, this is $9.99900 \\times 10^{-3}$.\n3. $F_{K,+} = 0.0159992$. This number already has six significant figures, $1.59992 \\times 10^{-2}$.\n\nThe final answer is the row matrix $(a_{0}^{\\text{lim}}, a_{1}^{\\text{lim}}, F_{K,+})$.",
