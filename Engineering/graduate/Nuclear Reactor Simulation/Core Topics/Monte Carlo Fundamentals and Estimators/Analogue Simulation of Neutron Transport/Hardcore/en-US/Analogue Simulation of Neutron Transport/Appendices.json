A solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires the determination of the ratio of the probability of an absorption event to the probability of a scattering event for a neutron at a specific energy. This is a fundamental concept in analogue Monte Carlo methods for particle transport.\n\nFrom first principles, in a material with multiple possible reactions, the probability $P_i(E)$ of a specific reaction type $i$ occurring, given that a collision has happened at energy $E$, is the ratio of the macroscopic cross-section for that reaction, $\\Sigma_i(E)$, to the total macroscopic cross-section, $\\Sigma_t(E)$. The total cross-section is the sum of all partial cross-sections.\n\nIn this case, there are only two reaction channels: absorption ($a$) and scattering ($s$). Therefore, the total macroscopic cross-section is given by:\n$$\n\\Sigma_{t}(E) = \\Sigma_{a}(E) + \\Sigma_{s}(E)\n$$\n\nThe probability of absorption, $P_a(E)$, and the probability of scattering, $P_s(E)$, for a collision at energy $E$ are:\n$$\nP_{a}(E) = \\frac{\\Sigma_{a}(E)}{\\Sigma_{t}(E)}\n$$\n$$\nP_{s}(E) = \\frac{\\Sigma_{s}(E)}{\\Sigma_{t}(E)}\n$$\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio $R$ of the probability of selecting absorption to the probability of selecting scattering at $E = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$. This ratio is:\n$$\nR = \\frac{P_{a}(E)}{P_{s}(E)} = \\frac{\\frac{\\Sigma_{a}(E)}{\\Sigma_{t}(E)}}{\\frac{\\Sigma_{s}(E)}{\\Sigma_{t}(E)}}\n$$\nThe total cross-section $\\Sigma_{t}(E)$ cancels out, simplifying the expression for the ratio to:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\Sigma_{a}(E)}{\\Sigma_{s}(E)}\n$$\nTo calculate this ratio at $E = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{MeV}$, we must first determine the values of $\\Sigma_{a}(0.5\\,\\mathrm{MeV})$ and $\\Sigma_{s}(0.5\\,\\mathrm{MeV})$ using linear interpolation based on the provided data.\n\nThe general formula for linear interpolation for a function $f(x)$ between points $(x_1, f(x_1))$ and $(x_2, f(x_2))$ is:\n$$\nf(x) = f(x_1) + \\frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1}(x - x_1)\n$$\nIn our case, the function is the cross-section and the variable is the energy $E$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for a derivation of the post-collision energy distribution for a neutron elastically scattering off a stationary nucleus, the verification of its normalization, the derivation of the mean fractional energy loss, and a numerical evaluation for a specific nucleus.\n\nThe derivation will begin from the fundamental principles of conservation of linear momentum and kinetic energy for a two-body elastic collision.\n\nLet the neutron have mass $m_n$ and initial laboratory-frame velocity $\\vec{v}_n$. Its initial kinetic energy is $E = \\frac{1}{2} m_n v_n^2$. The target nucleus, with mass number $A$, has a mass $m_A$. We make the standard approximation that $m_A = A m_n$. The nucleus is initially stationary, so its velocity $\\vec{V}_A = 0$.\n\nAfter the collision, the neutron has velocity $\\vec{v}'_n$ and energy $E' = \\frac{1}{2} m_n (v'_n)^2$, and the nucleus has velocity $\\vec{V}'_A$.\n\nThe conservation laws in the laboratory (lab) frame are:\n1.  Conservation of linear momentum: $m_n \\vec{v}_n = m_n \\vec{v}'_n + m_A \\vec{V}'_A$.\n2.  Conservation of kinetic energy: $\\frac{1}{2} m_n v_n^2 = \\frac{1}{2} m_n (v'_n)^2 + \\frac{1}{2} m_A (V'_A)^2$.\n\nThe analysis is greatly simplified by transforming to the center-of-mass (CM) frame. The velocity of the CM is given by:\n$$ \\vec{v}_{cm} = \\frac{m_n \\vec{v}_n + m_A \\vec{V}_A}{m_n + m_A} = \\frac{m_n \\vec{v}_n}{m_n + A m_n} = \\frac{1}{A+1} \\vec{v}_n $$\nThe velocities of the neutron and the nucleus in the CM frame *before* the collision are:\n$$ \\vec{u}_n = \\vec{v}_n - \\vec{v}_{cm} = \\vec{v}_n - \\frac{1}{A+1} \\vec{v}_n = \\frac{A}{A+1} \\vec{v}_n $$\n$$ \\vec{u}_A = \\vec{V}_A - \\vec{v}_{cm} = 0 - \\frac{1}{A+1} \\vec{v}_n = -\\frac{1}{A+1} \\vec{v}_n $$\nIn an elastic collision, the speeds of the particles in the CM frame are unchanged. The collision only changes their direction. Let $\\vec{u}'_n$ be the neutron's post-collision velocity in the CM frame. We have:\n$$ |\\vec{u}'_n| = |\\vec{u}_n| = \\frac{A}{A+1} v_n $$\nThe post-collision velocity of the neutron in the lab frame, $\\vec{v}'_n$, is found by transforming back from the CM frame:\n$$ \\vec{v}'_n = \\vec{u}'_n + \\vec{v}_{cm} $$\nThe magnitude of $\\vec{v}'_n$ is what determines the final energy $E'$. We find its square using the law of cosines on the vector addition triangle:\n$$ (v'_n)^2 = |\\vec{v}'_n|^2 = |\\vec{u}'_n + \\vec{v}_{cm}|^2 = (\\vec{u}'_n)^2 + (\\vec{v}_{cm})^2 + 2 \\vec{u}'_n \\cdot \\vec{v}_{cm} $$\n$$ (v'_n)^2 = |\\vec{u}'_n|^2 + |\\vec{v}_{cm}|^2 + 2 |\\vec{u}'_n| |\\vec{v}_{cm}| \\cos(\\theta_c) $$\nwhere $\\theta_c$ is the scattering angle in the CM frame, which is the angle between the initial and final neutron velocity vectors in that frame, $\\vec{u}_n$ and $\\vec{u}'_n$. Since $\\vec{u}_n$ and $\\vec{v}_{cm}$ are both parallel to $\\vec{v}_n$, $\\theta_c$ is also the angle between $\\vec{u}'_n$ and $\\vec{v}_{cm}$.\n\nSubstituting the magnitudes:\n$$ (v'_n)^2 = \\left(\\frac{A}{A+1} v_n\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{A+1} v_n\\right)^2 + 2 \\left(\\frac{A}{A+1} v_n\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{A+1} v_n\\right) \\cos(\\theta_c) $$\n$$ (v'_n)^2 = \\frac{v_n^2}{(A+1)^2} \\left[ A^2 + 1 + 2A \\cos(\\theta_c) \\right] $$\nNow, we relate the energies. Multiplying by $\\frac{1}{2}m_n$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2}m_n (v'_n)^2 = \\left( \\frac{1}{2}m_n v_n^2 \\right) \\frac{A^2 + 1 + 2A \\cos(\\theta_c)}{(A+1)^2} $$\n$$ E' = E \\frac{A^2 + 1 + 2A \\cos(\\theta_c)}{(A+1)^2} $$\nThis equation connects the post-collision lab energy $E'$ to the pre-collision lab energy $E$ and the CM scattering angle $\\theta_c$.\n\nThe problem states that scattering is isotropic in the CM frame. This means there is no preferred scattering direction. The probability of the neutron scattering into a solid angle $d\\Omega_c = \\sin(\\theta_c) d\\theta_c d\\phi_c$ is uniform. The probability density function (PDF) for the cosine of the scattering angle, $\\mu_c = \\cos(\\theta_c)$, is uniform over its range $[-1, 1]$. The PDF is $p(\\mu_c) = 1/2$ for $\\mu_c \\in [-1, 1]$ and $0$ otherwise.\n\nTo find the PDF for the energy, $p(E' \\mid E)$, we use the change of variables method: $p(E' \\mid E) = p(\\mu_c) \\left| \\frac{d\\mu_c}{dE'} \\right|$.\nFirst, we find the range of possible values for $E'$. The relationship between $E'$ and $\\mu_c$ is linear.\nThe minimum energy, $E'_{min}$, occurs at $\\mu_c = -1$ (head-on collision, $\\theta_c=\\pi$):\n$$ E'_{min} = E \\frac{A^2 + 1 - 2A}{(A+1)^2} = E \\frac{(A-1)^2}{(A+1)^2} \\equiv \\alpha E $$\nThe collision parameter $\\alpha$ is defined as $\\alpha = \\left(\\frac{A-1}{A+1}\\right)^2$.\nThe maximum energy, $E'_{max}$, occurs at $\\mu_c = 1$ (glancing collision, $\\theta_c=0$):\n$$ E'_{max} = E \\frac{A^2 + 1 + 2A}{(A+1)^2} = E \\frac{(A+1)^2}{(A+1)^2} = E $$\nThus, the final energy $E'$ can range from $\\alpha E$ to $E$.\n\nNext, we find the derivative $\\frac{d\\mu_c}{dE'}$. From the energy relation:\n$$ \\mu_c = \\frac{1}{2A} \\left[ \\frac{E'}{E}(A+1)^2 - (A^2+1) \\right] $$\n$$ \\frac{d\\mu_c}{dE'} = \\frac{1}{2AE} (A+1)^2 $$\nThis derivative is constant and positive.\nNow we can write the PDF for $E'$:\n$$ p(E' \\mid E) = p(\\mu_c) \\left| \\frac{d\\mu_c}{dE'} \\right| = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{(A+1)^2}{2AE} = \\frac{(A+1)^2}{4AE} $$\nThe width of the energy distribution is $E - \\alpha E = E(1-\\alpha)$. The height of a uniform distribution is $1/(\\text{width})$, so the PDF is:\n$$ p(E' \\mid E) = \\frac{1}{E(1-\\alpha)} = \\frac{1}{E \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{A-1}{A+1}\\right)^2\\right)} = \\frac{1}{E \\frac{(A+1)^2 - (A-1)^2}{(A+1)^2}} = \\frac{(A+1)^2}{E(4A)} $$\nThis confirms our result. So, the conditional PDF is:\n$$ p(E' \\mid E) = \\begin{cases} \\frac{1}{E(1-\\alpha)}  \\quad \\text{if } \\alpha E \\le E' \\le E \\\\ 0  \\quad \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} $$\n\nTo verify that the PDF is properly normalized, we integrate over all possible energies:\n$$ \\int_0^\\infty p(E' \\mid E) \\, dE' = \\int_{\\alpha E}^{E} \\frac{1}{E(1-\\alpha)} \\, dE' = \\frac{1}{E(1-\\alpha)} [E']_{\\alpha E}^E = \\frac{E - \\alpha E}{E(1-\\alpha)} = \\frac{E(1-\\alpha)}{E(1-\\alpha)} = 1 $$\nThe distribution is correctly normalized.\n\nNext, we derive the mean fractional energy loss, $\\langle \\Delta \\rangle = \\langle (E - E')/E \\rangle$.\n$$ \\langle \\Delta \\rangle = \\left\\langle 1 - \\frac{E'}{E} \\right\\rangle = 1 - \\frac{\\langle E' \\rangle}{E} $$\nWe first compute the mean post-collision energy, $\\langle E' \\rangle$:\n$$ \\langle E' \\rangle = \\int_{\\alpha E}^{E} E' p(E' \\mid E) \\, dE' = \\int_{\\alpha E}^{E} E' \\frac{1}{E(1-\\alpha)} \\, dE' $$\n$$ \\langle E' \\rangle = \\frac{1}{E(1-\\alpha)} \\left[ \\frac{(E')^2}{2} \\right]_{\\alpha E}^{E} = \\frac{1}{2E(1-\\alpha)} \\left( E^2 - (\\alpha E)^2 \\right) $$\n$$ \\langle E' \\rangle = \\frac{E^2(1-\\alpha^2)}{2E(1-\\alpha)} = \\frac{E(1-\\alpha)(1+\\alpha)}{2(1-\\alpha)} = \\frac{E(1+\\alpha)}{2} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\langle \\Delta \\rangle$:\n$$ \\langle \\Delta \\rangle = 1 - \\frac{1}{E} \\left( \\frac{E(1+\\alpha)}{2} \\right) = 1 - \\frac{1+\\alpha}{2} = \\frac{1-\\alpha}{2} $$\nExpressing this in terms of $A$:\n$$ \\langle \\Delta \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ 1 - \\left(\\frac{A-1}{A+1}\\right)^2 \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{(A+1)^2 - (A-1)^2}{(A+1)^2} \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{4A}{(A+1)^2} = \\frac{2A}{(A+1)^2} $$\n\nFor context, we examine the limiting cases:\nFor $A=1$ (e.g., hydrogen), $\\alpha = 0$. The neutron can lose all its energy in one collision. The mean fractional energy loss is $\\langle \\Delta \\rangle = \\frac{2(1)}{(1+1)^2} = \\frac{1}{2}$. This represents the most efficient slowing down (moderation) on a per-collision basis.\nFor $A \\to \\infty$ (an infinitely heavy nucleus), $\\alpha \\to 1$. The neutron loses no energy, as $E' \\to E$. The mean fractional energy loss is $\\langle \\Delta \\rangle \\to 0$. This is analogous to a ball bouncing off a massive, fixed wall.\nThe case of $A=12$ (carbon) represents an intermediate moderator, less effective per collision than hydrogen but more effective than very heavy nuclei. It is a practical moderator due to other properties like low neutron absorption.\n\nFinally, we evaluate $\\langle \\Delta \\rangle$ for $A=12$ and round to four significant figures.\n$$ \\langle \\Delta \\rangle = \\frac{2A}{(A+1)^2} = \\frac{2(12)}{(12+1)^2} = \\frac{24}{13^2} = \\frac{24}{169} $$\n$$ \\frac{24}{169} \\approx 0.142011834... $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.1420$.",

By Wald's identity, the expected total path length is:\n$$E[L] = E[N] E[s] = \\frac{\\Sigma_t}{\\Sigma_a} \\times \\frac{1}{\\Sigma_t} = \\frac{1}{\\Sigma_a}$$\nThe expected value of the track-length estimator is therefore:\n$$E[T_x] = E[\\Sigma_x L] = \\Sigma_x E[L] = \\frac{\\Sigma_x}{\\Sigma_a}$$\nBoth estimators are unbiased, as $E[C_x] = E[T_x] = \\lambda_x = \\Sigma_x / \\Sigma_a$. We now proceed to calculate their variances.\n\n**Variance of the Track-Length Estimator, $\\operatorname{Var}(T_x)$**\n\nThe variance of the track-length estimator is given by $\\operatorname{Var}(T_x) = \\operatorname{Var}(\\Sigma_x L) = \\Sigma_x^2 \\operatorname{Var}(L)$. We need to find the variance of the total path length $L = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} s_i$. This is a sum of a random number $N$ of i.i.d. random variables $s_i$. The variance of such a sum is given by the Blackwell-Girshick equation (a generalization of Wald's identity for variance):\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(L) = E[N]\\operatorname{Var}(s) + \\operatorname{Var}(N)(E[s])^2$$\nThe moments of the constituent distributions are:\nFor the path length $s \\sim \\text{Exp}(\\Sigma_t)$:\n$$E[s] = \\frac{1}{\\Sigma_t}, \\quad \\operatorname{Var}(s) = \\frac{1}{\\Sigma_t^2}$$\nFor the number of collisions $N \\sim \\text{Geom}(p_a)$:\n$$E[N] = \\frac{1}{p_a} = \\frac{\\Sigma_t}{\\Sigma_a}$$\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(N) = \\frac{1-p_a}{p_a^2} = \\frac{1-\\Sigma_a/\\Sigma_t}{(\\Sigma_a/\\Sigma_t)^2} = \\frac{(\\Sigma_t-\\Sigma_a)/\\Sigma_t}{\\Sigma_a^2/\\Sigma_t^2} = \\frac{(\\Sigma_t-\\Sigma_a)\\Sigma_t}{\\Sigma_a^2}$$\nSubstituting these into the variance formula for $L$:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(L) = \\left(\\frac{\\Sigma_t}{\\Sigma_a}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{\\Sigma_t^2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{(\\Sigma_t-\\Sigma_a)\\Sigma_t}{\\Sigma_a^2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{1}{\\Sigma_t}\\right)^2$$\n$$\\operatorname{Var(L)} = \\frac{1}{\\Sigma_a\\Sigma_t} + \\frac{\\Sigma_t-\\Sigma_a}{\\Sigma_a^2\\Sigma_t}$$\nCombining the terms over a common denominator $\\Sigma_a^2\\Sigma_t$:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(L) = \\frac{\\Sigma_a}{\\Sigma_a^2\\Sigma_t} + \\frac{\\Sigma_t-\\Sigma_a}{\\Sigma_a^2\\Sigma_t} = \\frac{\\Sigma_a + \\Sigma_t - \\Sigma_a}{\\Sigma_a^2\\Sigma_t} = \\frac{\\Sigma_t}{\\Sigma_a^2\\Sigma_t} = \\frac{1}{\\Sigma_a^2}$$\nThe variance of the total path length is surprisingly simple. The variance of the track-length estimator is then:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(T_x) = \\Sigma_x^2 \\operatorname{Var}(L) = \\Sigma_x^2 \\left(\\frac{1}{\\Sigma_a^2}\\right) = \\frac{\\Sigma_x^2}{\\Sigma_a^2}$$\n\n**Variance of the Collision Estimator, $\\operatorname{Var}(C_x)$**\n\nThe collision estimator $C_x$ is the number of $x$-type reactions before absorption. We use the law of total variance: $\\operatorname{Var}(C_x) = E[\\operatorname{Var}(C_x|N)] + \\operatorname{Var}(E[C_x|N])$.\nGiven that the total number of collisions is $N=n$, the first $n-1$ collisions are non-absorbing. The fate of each of these $n-1$ collisions is an independent trial. The conditional probability that a collision results in an $x$-reaction, given that it is non-absorbing, is:\n$$p'_x = P(\\text{reaction }x | \\text{not absorption}) = \\frac{P(\\text{reaction }x)}{P(\\text{not absorption})} = \\frac{\\Sigma_x/\\Sigma_t}{(\\Sigma_t-\\Sigma_a)/\\Sigma_t} = \\frac{\\Sigma_x}{\\Sigma_t-\\Sigma_a}$$\nThus, conditional on $N=n$, $C_x$ follows a binomial distribution, $C_x | (N=n) \\sim \\text{Binomial}(n-1, p'_x)$. The conditional moments are:\n$$E[C_x|N=n] = (n-1)p'_x \\implies E[C_x|N] = (N-1)p'_x$$\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(C_x|N=n) = (n-1)p'_x(1-p'_x) \\implies \\operatorname{Var}(C_x|N) = (N-1)p'_x(1-p'_x)$$\nNow we compute the two terms in the law of total variance.\nFirst term:\n$$E[\\operatorname{Var}(C_x|N)] = E[(N-1)p'_x(1-p'_x)] = p'_x(1-p'_x)E[N-1]$$\n$$E[N-1] = E[N]-1 = \\frac{\\Sigma_t}{\\Sigma_a} - 1 = \\frac{\\Sigma_t-\\Sigma_a}{\\Sigma_a}$$\n$$1-p'_x = 1 - \\frac{\\Sigma_x}{\\Sigma_t-\\Sigma_a} = \\frac{\\Sigma_t-\\Sigma_a-\\Sigma_x}{\\Sigma_t-\\Sigma_a}$$\n$$E[\\operatorname{Var}(C_x|N)] = \\left(\\frac{\\Sigma_x}{\\Sigma_t-\\Sigma_a}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\Sigma_t-\\Sigma_a-\\Sigma_x}{\\Sigma_t-\\Sigma_a}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\Sigma_t-\\Sigma_a}{\\Sigma_a}\\right) = \\frac{\\Sigma_x(\\Sigma_t-\\Sigma_a-\\Sigma_x)}{(\\Sigma_t-\\Sigma_a)\\Sigma_a}$$\nSecond term:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(E[C_x|N]) = \\operatorname{Var}((N-1)p'_x) = (p'_x)^2 \\operatorname{Var}(N-1) = (p'_x)^2 \\operatorname{Var}(N)$$\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(E[C_x|N]) = \\left(\\frac{\\Sigma_x}{\\Sigma_t-\\Sigma_a}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{(\\Sigma_t-\\Sigma_a)\\Sigma_t}{\\Sigma_a^2}\\right) = \\frac{\\Sigma_x^2 \\Sigma_t}{(\\Sigma_t-\\Sigma_a)\\Sigma_a^2}$$\nSumming the two terms to find $\\operatorname{Var}(C_x)$:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(C_x) = \\frac{\\Sigma_x(\\Sigma_t-\\Sigma_a-\\Sigma_x)}{(\\Sigma_t-\\Sigma_a)\\Sigma_a} + \\frac{\\Sigma_x^2 \\Sigma_t}{(\\Sigma_t-\\Sigma_a)\\Sigma_a^2}$$\nWe use the common denominator $(\\Sigma_t-\\Sigma_a)\\Sigma_a^2$:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(C_x) = \\frac{\\Sigma_x(\\Sigma_t-\\Sigma_a-\\Sigma_x)\\Sigma_a + \\Sigma_x^2 \\Sigma_t}{(\\Sigma_t-\\Sigma_a)\\Sigma_a^2}$$\nExpanding the numerator:\n$$\\text{Numerator} = \\Sigma_x\\Sigma_t\\Sigma_a - \\Sigma_x\\Sigma_a^2 - \\Sigma_x^2\\Sigma_a + \\Sigma_x^2\\Sigma_t$$\nFactorizing the numerator:\n$$\\text{Numerator} = \\Sigma_x\\Sigma_t(\\Sigma_a + \\Sigma_x) - \\Sigma_x\\Sigma_a(\\Sigma_a + \\Sigma_x) = (\\Sigma_x\\Sigma_t - \\Sigma_x\\Sigma_a)(\\Sigma_a + \\Sigma_x)$$\n$$\\text{Numerator} = \\Sigma_x(\\Sigma_t - \\Sigma_a)(\\Sigma_a + \\Sigma_x)$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for variance:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(C_x) = \\frac{\\Sigma_x(\\Sigma_t - \\Sigma_a)(\\Sigma_x + \\Sigma_a)}{(\\Sigma_t-\\Sigma_a)\\Sigma_a^2} = \\frac{\\Sigma_x(\\Sigma_x + \\Sigma_a)}{\\Sigma_a^2}$$\n\n**Comparison of Variances**\n\nWe have derived the two variances:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(T_x) = \\frac{\\Sigma_x^2}{\\Sigma_a^2}$$\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(C_x) = \\frac{\\Sigma_x^2 + \\Sigma_x\\Sigma_a}{\\Sigma_a^2} = \\frac{\\Sigma_x^2}{\\Sigma_a^2} + \\frac{\\Sigma_x}{\\Sigma_a}$$\nWe can rewrite the variance of the collision estimator in terms of the variance of the track-length estimator and the expected value of the estimators:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(C_x) = \\operatorname{Var}(T_x) + E[T_x]$$\nSince $\\Sigma_a  0$ and $\\Sigma_x \\ge 0$, the term $E[T_x] = \\Sigma_x/\\Sigma_a$ is non-negative. Therefore, we have the inequality:\n$$\\operatorname{Var}(C_x) \\ge \\operatorname{Var}(T_x)$$\nEquality holds only in the trivial case where $\\Sigma_x=0$, for which both variances are zero. For any problem where the target reaction can occur ($\\Sigma_x0$), the track-length estimator has a strictly lower variance than the collision estimator. The ratio of their variances is:\n$$\\frac{\\operatorname{Var}(C_x)}{\\operatorname{Var}(T_x)} = \\frac{(\\Sigma_x^2/\\Sigma_a^2) + (\\Sigma_x/\\Sigma_a)}{\\Sigma_x^2/\\Sigma_a^2} = 1 + \\frac{\\Sigma_a}{\\Sigma_x}$$\nThis demonstrates the general superiority of the track-length estimator over the analogue collision estimator in terms of statistical efficiency.\n\nThe final answer requires the two variances $\\operatorname{Var}(T_{x})$ and $\\operatorname{Var}(C_{x})$ in that order.",
