            "introduction": "Our first practice tackles the most fundamental scenario in fission gas modeling: the steady-state distribution of gas atoms within a single fuel grain. By considering a balance between the constant production of gas from fission, $S$, and its outward diffusion, we can derive the shape of the concentration profile. This exercise  is crucial for understanding how key parameters like the diffusion coefficient ($D$) and grain size ($R$) control gas accumulation and provides the basis for nearly all advanced fission gas release models.",

            "problem": "In modeling intra-granular fission gas behavior in Uranium Dioxide (UO$_2$) fuel during steady operation, consider a single spherical fuel grain of radius $R$ within which fission gas atoms (e.g., xenon and krypton) are produced uniformly at a volumetric rate $S$ and diffuse with a constant tracer diffusion coefficient $D$. Assume spherical symmetry, no sinks or sources other than the uniform production $S$ within the grain volume, and neglect any re-solution or trapping within the grain interior.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the steady-state radial concentration profile $C(r)$ and the volume-averaged concentration $\\bar{C}$ of fission gas atoms within a spherical fuel grain. The validation of the problem statement is the first step.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- System: A single spherical fuel grain of radius $R$.\n- Gas production rate: Uniform and volumetric, denoted by $S$. Units can be considered as atoms per unit volume per unit time, e.g., $\\mathrm{atoms} \\cdot \\mathrm{m}^{-3} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n- Diffusion coefficient: Constant tracer diffusion coefficient, $D$. Units are $\\mathrm{m}^{2} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n- Symmetry: Spherical symmetry is assumed. The concentration $C$ is a function of the radial coordinate $r$ only, i.e., $C=C(r)$.\n- Sinks and sources: A uniform volumetric source $S$ exists for $0 \\le r \\le R$. There are no other sinks or sources within the grain volume.\n- Boundary conditions:\n    1. The grain boundary at $r=R$ is a perfect sink, so the concentration is zero: $C(R)=0$.\n    2. The concentration must remain finite at the center of the grain, $r=0$. This also implies a symmetry condition of zero flux at the center, $\\frac{dC}{dr}|_{r=0} = 0$.\n- Operational mode: The system is at steady state, meaning all time derivatives are zero.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated against the validation criteria.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem describes a classic diffusion-production scenario governed by Fick's laws of diffusion. This is a fundamental and widely used model in materials science and nuclear engineering, often referred to as the Booth model for fission gas release. The assumptions, such as a spherical grain, constant diffusion coefficient, and uniform production rate, are standard simplifications used to obtain an analytical solution that provides key physical insights. The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a governing physical principle (diffusion with a source), a defined geometry (a sphere), and a complete set of boundary conditions for a second-order ordinary differential equation that results from the steady-state assumption. The conditions ($C(R)=0$ and finitude/zero-flux at $r=0$) are sufficient to determine a unique and stable solution.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated using precise, unambiguous, and objective scientific terminology. It is free from subjective claims or opinions.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the listed flaws (e.g., scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity).\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Concentration Profile $C(r)$\n\nThe local conservation of species in a stationary medium is described by the equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{J} + S\n$$\nwhere $C$ is the concentration, $\\vec{J}$ is the diffusive flux vector, and $S$ is the volumetric source term.\n\nAccording to Fick's first law, the flux is proportional to the concentration gradient:\n$$\n\\vec{J} = -D \\nabla C\n$$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusion coefficient.\n\nSubstituting Fick's law into the conservation equation gives Fick's second law with a source term:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\cdot (D \\nabla C) + S\n$$\nGiven the assumption of spherical symmetry, the concentration $C$ depends only on the radial coordinate $r$, so $C=C(r)$. The Laplacian operator $\\nabla^2 = \\nabla \\cdot \\nabla$ in spherical coordinates simplifies to:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 C = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r^2 \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial r} \\right)\n$$\nWith a constant diffusion coefficient $D$, the equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r} \\left( r^2 \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial r} \\right) + S\n$$\nThe problem specifies steady-state operation, which means $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t}=0$. The governing equation thus simplifies to an ordinary differential equation (ODE):\n$$\n0 = D \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dC}{dr} \\right) + S\n$$\nRearranging the terms, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dC}{dr} \\right) = -\\frac{S}{D} r^2\n$$\nWe can solve this equation by integrating twice with respect to $r$. The first integration yields:\n$$\nr^2 \\frac{dC}{dr} = \\int -\\frac{S}{D} r^2 \\, dr = -\\frac{S r^3}{3D} + A_1\n$$\nwhere $A_1$ is the first integration constant. Dividing by $r^2$, we have the expression for the concentration gradient:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dr} = -\\frac{S r}{3D} + \\frac{A_1}{r^2}\n$$\nThe boundary condition at the center of the grain ($r=0$) is that the concentration must be finite. Due to spherical symmetry, the concentration gradient must be zero at the center: $\\frac{dC}{dr}|_{r=0} = 0$. If $A_1$ were non-zero, the term $\\frac{A_1}{r^2}$ would cause the gradient to diverge to infinity as $r \\to 0$. Therefore, we must have $A_1 = 0$.\n\nWith $A_1=0$, the equation for the gradient simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{dC}{dr} = -\\frac{S r}{3D}\n$$\nIntegrating a second time with respect to $r$ gives the concentration profile:\n$$\nC(r) = \\int -\\frac{S r}{3D} \\, dr = -\\frac{S r^2}{6D} + A_2\n$$\nwhere $A_2$ is the second integration constant. We use the boundary condition at the grain surface, $C(R)=0$, to determine $A_2$:\n$$\n0 = C(R) = -\\frac{S R^2}{6D} + A_2\n$$\nSolving for $A_2$, we find:\n$$\nA_2 = \\frac{S R^2}{6D}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $C(r)$, we obtain the final steady-state concentration profile:\n$$\nC(r) = \\frac{S R^2}{6D} - \\frac{S r^2}{6D} = \\frac{S}{6D}(R^2 - r^2)\n$$\n\n### Derivation of the Volume-Averaged Concentration $\\bar{C}$\n\nThe volume-averaged concentration $\\bar{C}$ over the spherical grain volume $V$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\bar{C} = \\frac{1}{V} \\int_V C(r) \\, dV\n$$\nFor a sphere of radius $R$, the volume is $V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$. In spherical coordinates, the differential volume element is $dV = 4\\pi r^2 dr$. The integral becomes:\n$$\n\\bar{C} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3} \\int_0^R C(r) (4\\pi r^2) \\, dr\n$$\nThe factor $4\\pi$ cancels out, simplifying the expression to:\n$$\n\\bar{C} = \\frac{3}{R^3} \\int_0^R C(r) r^2 \\, dr\n$$\nNow, substitute the derived expression for $C(r)$:\n$$\n\\bar{C} = \\frac{3}{R^3} \\int_0^R \\frac{S}{6D}(R^2 - r^2) r^2 \\, dr\n$$\nWe can pull the constants outside the integral:\n$$\n\\bar{C} = \\frac{3S}{6DR^3} \\int_0^R (R^2 r^2 - r^4) \\, dr = \\frac{S}{2DR^3} \\int_0^R (R^2 r^2 - r^4) \\, dr\n$$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$\n\\int_0^R (R^2 r^2 - r^4) \\, dr = \\left[ R^2 \\frac{r^3}{3} - \\frac{r^5}{5} \\right]_0^R\n$$\nEvaluating the definite integral from $0$ to $R$:\n$$\n\\left( R^2 \\frac{R^3}{3} - \\frac{R^5}{5} \\right) - (0 - 0) = \\frac{R^5}{3} - \\frac{R^5}{5} = \\frac{5R^5 - 3R^5}{15} = \\frac{2R^5}{15}\n$$\nFinally, substitute this result back into the expression for $\\bar{C}$:\n$$\n\\bar{C} = \\frac{S}{2DR^3} \\left( \\frac{2R^5}{15} \\right)\n$$\nSimplifying the expression gives the volume-averaged concentration:\n$$\n\\bar{C} = \\frac{S R^2}{15D}\n$$\nThe two required expressions are $C(r) = \\frac{S}{6D}(R^2 - r^2)$ and $\\bar{C} = \\frac{S R^2}{15D}$.",

The partial derivatives of $C$ are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial r} = \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r} - \\frac{u}{r^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2} C}{\\partial r^{2}} = \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial^{2} u}{\\partial r^{2}} - \\frac{2}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r} + \\frac{2u}{r^3}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the spherical diffusion equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = D \\left( \\left( \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial^{2} u}{\\partial r^{2}} - \\frac{2}{r^2} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r} + \\frac{2u}{r^3} \\right) + \\frac{2}{r} \\left( \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r} - \\frac{u}{r^2} \\right) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = D \\left( \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial^{2} u}{\\partial r^{2}} \\right)\n$$\nThis simplifies to the one-dimensional heat/diffusion equation for $u(r, t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^{2} u}{\\partial r^{2}}\n$$\nThe initial and boundary conditions must be transformed for $u(r, t)$:\n1.  **Initial Condition:** $C(r, 0) = C_0$ for $0 \\le r  R$. Thus, $u(r, 0) = r C(r, 0) = r C_0$.\n2.  **Boundary Condition at Center:** The concentration $C(r,t)$ must be finite at $r=0$.

Consider a representative control volume in which the grain boundary (GB) region communicates with the rod plenum through a single open path that can be modeled as an orifice with constant molar conductance $G$. The GB stores an initial gas inventory $N_{\\mathrm{gb},0}$, and the plenum contains an initial gas inventory corresponding to pressure $P_{\\mathrm{pl},0}$.

It is well-posed, providing a complete set of initial conditions, physical laws, and parameters needed to formulate and solve a system of ordinary differential equations. The language is objective and precise. The provided parameters are physically plausible for the scenario described. For instance, the initial GB pressure calculates to $P_{\\mathrm{gb},0} = N_{\\mathrm{gb},0} R T / V_{\\mathrm{gb}} \\approx 10^{7}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$, a high but realistic value. The problem is self-contained and internally consistent. No flaws are identified.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nLet $N_{\\mathrm{gb}}(t)$ and $N_{\\mathrm{pl}}(t)$ be the number of moles of gas in the grain boundary and plenum, respectively, at time $t$. Let the corresponding pressures be $P_{\\mathrm{gb}}(t)$ and $P_{\\mathrm{pl}}(t)$. The temperature $T$ and volumes $V_{\\mathrm{gb}}$ and $V_{\\mathrm{pl}}$ are constant.\n\nThe ideal gas law relates pressure and molar inventory for each volume:\n$$P_{\\mathrm{gb}}(t) = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{gb}}(t) R T}{V_{\\mathrm{gb}}}$$\n$$P_{\\mathrm{pl}}(t) = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{pl}}(t) R T}{V_{\\mathrm{pl}}}$$\nwhere $R$ is the universal gas constant.\n\nConservation of mass dictates the rate of change of moles in each volume. Gas flows from the GB to the plenum, so the rate of change of moles in the GB is negative, and in the plenum, it is positive. The molar flow rate is given as proportional to the pressure difference:\n$$\\frac{dN_{\\mathrm{gb}}}{dt} = -G (P_{\\mathrm{gb}}(t) - P_{\\mathrm{pl}}(t))$$\n$$\\frac{dN_{\\mathrm{pl}}}{dt} = +G (P_{\\mathrm{gb}}(t) - P_{\\mathrm{pl}}(t))$$\nNote that the total number of moles in the system is conserved: $\\frac{d}{dt}(N_{\\mathrm{gb}} + N_{\\mathrm{pl}}) = 0$.\n\nTo derive the evolution of the pressures, we differentiate the ideal gas law expressions with respect to time:\n$$\\frac{dP_{\\mathrm{gb}}}{dt} = \\frac{R T}{V_{\\mathrm{gb}}} \\frac{dN_{\\mathrm{gb}}}{dt}$$\n$$\\frac{dP_{\\mathrm{pl}}}{dt} = \\frac{R T}{V_{\\mathrm{pl}}} \\frac{dN_{\\mathrm{pl}}}{dt}$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for the molar rates, we obtain the coupled evolution equations for the pressures:\n$$\\frac{dP_{\\mathrm{gb}}}{dt} = -\\frac{G R T}{V_{\\mathrm{gb}}} (P_{\\mathrm{gb}}(t) - P_{\\mathrm{pl}}(t))$$\n$$\\frac{dP_{\\mathrm{pl}}}{dt} = \\frac{G R T}{V_{\\mathrm{pl}}} (P_{\\mathrm{gb}}(t) - P_{\\mathrm{pl}}(t))$$\nThis completes the first part of the task.\n\nNext, we show that the pressure difference, $\\Delta P(t) = P_{\\mathrm{gb}}(t) - P_{\\mathrm{pl}}(t)$, relaxes exponentially. We differentiate $\\Delta P(t)$ with respect to time:\n$$\\frac{d(\\Delta P)}{dt} = \\frac{dP_{\\mathrm{gb}}}{dt} - \\frac{dP_{\\mathrm{pl}}}{dt}$$\nSubstituting the derived pressure evolution equations:\n$$\\frac{d(\\Delta P)}{dt} = \\left(-\\frac{G R T}{V_{\\mathrm{gb}}}\\right) \\Delta P - \\left(\\frac{G R T}{V_{\\mathrm{pl}}}\\right) \\Delta P$$\n$$\\frac{d(\\Delta P)}{dt} = -G R T \\left(\\frac{1}{V_{\\mathrm{gb}}} + \\frac{1}{V_{\\mathrm{pl}}}\\right) \\Delta P$$\nLet us define the relaxation constant $\\lambda$ as:\n$$\\lambda = G R T \\left(\\frac{1}{V_{\\mathrm{gb}}} + \\frac{1}{V_{\\mathrm{pl}}}\\right)$$\nThe differential equation becomes $\\frac{d(\\Delta P)}{dt} = -\\lambda \\Delta P$. This is a first-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation, whose solution is an exponential decay:\n$$\\Delta P(t) = \\Delta P(0) \\exp(-\\lambda t)$$\nwhere $\\Delta P(0) = P_{\\mathrm{gb}}(0) - P_{\\mathrm{pl}}(0)$ is the initial pressure difference. This demonstrates the exponential relaxation of the pressure difference, completing the second part of the task.\n\nThe finite plenum volume $V_{\\mathrm{pl}}$ is what bounds the total \"burst\" release of gas. As gas is released from the GB, the pressure $P_{\\mathrm{gb}}$ decreases while the pressure $P_{\\mathrm{pl}}$ increases. This reduces the driving force $\\Delta P(t)$, slowing down the release rate. The process continues until the pressures equilibrate, i.e., $\\Delta P(t \\to \\infty) = 0$, which implies $P_{\\mathrm{gb},\\infty} = P_{\\mathrm{pl},\\infty} = P_{\\infty}$. At this equilibrium, a non-zero inventory of gas, $N_{\\mathrm{gb},\\infty} = P_{\\infty} V_{\\mathrm{gb}} / (R T)$, remains within the grain boundary. The total released inventory is therefore finite and given by $N_{\\mathrm{gb},0} - N_{\\mathrm{gb},\\infty}$. If the plenum were infinite ($V_{\\mathrm{pl}} \\to \\infty$), its pressure would not rise, the driving force would remain higher for longer, and the final retained inventory $N_{\\mathrm{gb},\\infty}$ would be smaller, leading to a larger total release. The finite capacity of the coupled plenum volume thus provides a natural bound on the quantity of gas that can be released.\n\nTo compute $t_{0.95}$, we must relate the change in molar inventory to time. The amount of gas released from the GB up to time $t$ is $N_{\\mathrm{gb},0} - N_{\\mathrm{gb}}(t)$. The total releasable inventory is $N_{\\mathrm{gb},0} - N_{\\mathrm{gb},\\infty}$.\nLet's find an expression for $N_{\\mathrm{gb}}(t)$. From the mass conservation equation:\n$$\\frac{dN_{\\mathrm{gb}}}{dt} = -G \\Delta P(t) = -G \\Delta P(0) \\exp(-\\lambda t)$$\nIntegrating from $0$ to $t$:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{gb}}(t) - N_{\\mathrm{gb}}(0) = \\int_{0}^{t} -G \\Delta P(0) \\exp(-\\lambda t') dt' = \\frac{G \\Delta P(0)}{\\lambda} [\\exp(-\\lambda t')]_{0}^{t} = \\frac{G \\Delta P(0)}{\\lambda} (\\exp(-\\lambda t) - 1)$$\n$$N_{\\mathrm{gb}}(t) = N_{\\mathrm{gb},0} + \\frac{G \\Delta P(0)}{\\lambda} (\\exp(-\\lambda t) - 1)$$\nAt long times $(t \\to \\infty)$, $\\exp(-\\lambda t) \\to 0$, and $N_{\\mathrm{gb}}(t) \\to N_{\\mathrm{gb},\\infty}$.\n$$N_{\\mathrm{gb},\\infty} = N_{\\mathrm{gb},0} - \\frac{G \\Delta P(0)}{\\lambda}$$\nThe total releasable inventory is $N_{\\mathrm{gb},0} - N_{\\mathrm{gb},\\infty} = \\frac{G \\Delta P(0)}{\\lambda}$.\nSubstituting this back into the equation for $N_{\\mathrm{gb}}(t)$:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{gb}}(t) = N_{\\mathrm{gb},0} - (N_{\\mathrm{gb},0} - N_{\\mathrm{gb},\\infty})(1 - \\exp(-\\lambda t))$$\nRearranging gives the deviation from equilibrium:\n$$N_{\\mathrm{gb}}(t) - N_{\\mathrm{gb},\\infty} = (N_{\\mathrm{gb},0} - N_{\\mathrm{gb},\\infty}) \\exp(-\\lambda t)$$\nThe fraction of releasable inventory that has been evacuated by time $t$ is $f(t) = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{gb},0} - N_{\\mathrm{gb}}(t)}{N_{\\mathrm{gb},0} - N_{\\mathrm{gb},\\infty}}$.\nUsing our expression for $N_{\\mathrm{gb}}(t)$:\n$N_{\\mathrm{gb},0} - N_{\\mathrm{gb}}(t) = (N_{\\mathrm{gb},0} - N_{\\mathrm{gb},\\infty}) - (N_{\\mathrm{gb}}(t) - N_{\\mathrm{gb},\\infty}) = (N_{\\mathrm{gb},0} - N_{\\mathrm{gb},\\infty}) (1 - \\exp(-\\lambda t))$.\nThus, $f(t) = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda t)$.\n\nWe need to find the time $t_{0.95}$ such that $f(t_{0.95}) = 0.95$:\n$$0.95 = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda t_{0.95})$$\n$$\\exp(-\\lambda t_{0.95}) = 0.05$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$-\\lambda t_{0.95} = \\ln(0.05)$$\n$$t_{0.95} = -\\frac{\\ln(0.05)}{\\lambda} = \\frac{\\ln(1/0.05)}{\\lambda} = \\frac{\\ln(20)}{\\lambda}$$\nSubstituting the definition of $\\lambda$:\n$$t_{0.95} = \\frac{\\ln(20)}{G R T \\left(\\frac{1}{V_{\\mathrm{gb}}} + \\frac{1}{V_{\\mathrm{pl}}}\\right)}$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$G = 1.0 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}^{-1}$\n$R = 8.314\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n$T = 1000\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n$V_{\\mathrm{gb}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}$\n$V_{\\mathrm{pl}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}$\n\nFirst, calculate the relaxation constant $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda = (1.0 \\times 10^{-12}) \\times (8.314) \\times (1000) \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{1.0 \\times 10^{-9}} + \\frac{1}{1.0 \\times 10^{-5}}\\right)$$\n$$\\lambda = (8.314 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}^{-1}) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{9} + 1.0 \\times 10^{5})\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$$\n$$\\lambda = (8.314 \\times 10^{-9}) \\times (1.0001 \\times 10^{9})\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\n$$\\lambda \\approx 8.3148314\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nNow, calculate $t_{0.95}$:\n$$t_{0.95} = \\frac{\\ln(20)}{8.3148314\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} \\approx \\frac{2.995732}{8.3148314}\\,\\mathrm{s} \\approx 0.360291\\,\\mathrm{s}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $t_{0.95} = 0.3603\\,\\mathrm{s}$.",
