            "problem": "A Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) secondary loop is modeled as an idealized single-reheat-free Rankine cycle operating at fixed boundary conditions. The hot-side steam generator imposes a fixed boiler pressure and fixed inlet steam state, and the condenser imposes a fixed back-pressure. Assume one kilogram of working fluid circulates per cycle so that all energies are per unit mass. The following boundary conditions and property data at key states are given:\n\n- Boiler (steam generator) exit at turbine inlet: pressure $p_{1} = 6.0$ MPa, specific enthalpy $h_{1} = 3400$ kJ/kg, specific entropy $s_{1} = 6.60$ kJ/(kg K).\n- Condenser pressure: $p_{2} = 10$ kPa.

It is deemed **valid**. A solution will be developed.\n\nThe overall thermal efficiency of the Rankine cycle is defined as the ratio of net specific work output, $w_{net}$, to the specific heat input, $q_{in}$.\n$$\n\\eta_{th} = \\frac{w_{net}}{q_{in}}\n$$\nThe net specific work is the specific work produced by the turbine, $w_t$, minus the specific work consumed by the pump, $w_p$.\n$$\nw_{net} = w_t - w_p\n$$\nFrom the steady-flow energy equation for the respective adiabatic components, $w_t = h_1 - h_2$ and $w_p = h_3 - h_4$. The specific heat input in the boiler is $q_{in} = h_1 - h_3$. Substituting these into the efficiency equation gives:\n$$\n\\eta_{th} = \\frac{(h_1 - h_2) - (h_3 - h_4)}{h_1 - h_3}\n$$\nThe task is to find the new efficiency, $\\eta_{th,new}$, after the turbine efficiency degrades. This requires calculating the new actual turbine exit enthalpy, $h_{2,new}$, and the pump-exit enthalpy, $h_3$. The values $h_1$ and $h_4$ are given.\n\nFirst, we calculate the enthalpy at the pump outlet, $h_3$. This value is determined by fixed boundary conditions and is constant. The actual specific work input to the pump is $w_p = h_3 - h_4$. The pump's isentropic efficiency is $\\eta_p = \\frac{w_{p,s}}{w_p}$, where $w_{p,s}$ is the ideal isentropic work. For an incompressible liquid, $w_{p,s}$ is well-approximated by:\n$$\nw_{p,s} \\approx v_4 (p_3 - p_4)\n$$\nGiven that the pump raises the pressure from $p_2$ to $p_1$, we have $p_4=p_2$ and $p_3=p_1$.\n$$\nw_{p,s} = v_4 (p_1 - p_2)\n$$\nThe actual pump work is $w_p = \\frac{w_{p,s}}{\\eta_p} = \\frac{v_4(p_1 - p_2)}{\\eta_p}$. The enthalpy at the pump outlet is then:\n$$\nh_3 = h_4 + w_p = h_4 + \\frac{v_4(p_1 - p_2)}{\\eta_p}\n$$\nSubstituting the given values, noting that $6.0 \\text{ MPa} = 6000 \\text{ kPa}$:\n$$\nh_3 = 191.8 \\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{kg}} + \\frac{(1.01 \\times 10^{-3} \\frac{\\text{m}^3}{\\text{kg}})(6000 \\text{ kPa} - 10 \\text{ kPa})}{0.85}\n$$\n$$\nh_3 = 191.8 + \\frac{1.01 \\times 10^{-3} \\times 5990}{0.85} \\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{kg}} = 191.8 + \\frac{6.0499}{0.85} \\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{kg}}\n$$\n$$\nh_3 \\approx 191.8 + 7.117529 \\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{kg}} \\approx 198.917529 \\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{kg}}\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the new state at the turbine exit, $h_{2,new}$. The initial turbine isentropic efficiency is $\\eta_{t0} = 0.90$. It suffers a relative degradation of $3\\%$. The new efficiency, $\\eta_{t,new}$, is:\n$$\n\\eta_{t,new} = \\eta_{t0} (1 - 0.03) = 0.90 \\times 0.97 = 0.873\n$$\nThe turbine isentropic efficiency is defined as $\\eta_t = \\frac{h_1 - h_2}{h_1 - h_{2s}}$. We can solve for the new actual exit enthalpy, $h_{2,new}$:\n$$\nh_{2,new} = h_1 - \\eta_{t,new} (h_1 - h_{2s})\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nh_{2,new} = 3400 \\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{kg}} - 0.873 \\left(3400 \\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{kg}} - 2200 \\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{kg}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nh_{2,new} = 3400 - 0.873 \\times 1200 \\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{kg}} = 3400 - 1047.6 \\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{kg}} = 2352.4 \\frac{\\text{kJ}}{\\text{kg}}\n$$\n\nNow we have all the required enthalpy values to calculate the new thermal efficiency, $\\eta_{th,new}$.\nThe new specific turbine work is $w_{t,new} = h_1 - h_{2,new} = 1047.6$ kJ/kg.\nThe specific pump work is $w_p = h_3 - h_4 \\approx 7.117529$ kJ/kg.\nThe new net specific work is $w_{net,new} = w_{t,new} - w_p \\approx 1047.6 - 7.117529 \\approx 1040.482471$ kJ/kg.\nThe specific heat input is $q_{in} = h_1 - h_3 \\approx 3400 - 198.917529 \\approx 3201.082471$ kJ/kg.\n\nThe new cycle thermal efficiency is:\n$$\n\\eta_{th,new} = \\frac{w_{net,new}}{q_{in}} \\approx \\frac{1040.482471}{3201.082471} \\approx 0.325039\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\eta_{th,new} \\approx 0.3250\n$$",

The data values are physically realistic for a nuclear power cycle.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be developed.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe solution is structured according to the three tasks specified in the problem statement.\n\n#### 1. Component-wise Map of Exergy Destruction\n\nThe exergy destruction per unit mass, $e_d$, in a component is related to the entropy generation per unit mass, $s_{\\mathrm{gen}}$, by the Gouy–Stodola theorem:\n$$e_d = T_0 s_{\\mathrm{gen}}$$\nwhere $T_0 = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$ is the ambient temperature. We apply this equation to each component.\n\n-   Steam generator (SG):\n    $e_{d,\\mathrm{SG}} = (298\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\times (0.675\\,\\mathrm{kJ/(kg\\cdot K)}) = 201.15\\,\\mathrm{kJ/kg}$\n-   High-pressure (HP) turbine:\n    $e_{d,\\mathrm{HP}} = (298\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\times (0.200\\,\\mathrm{kJ/(kg\\cdot K)}) = 59.6\\,\\mathrm{kJ/kg}$\n-   Moisture separator reheater (MSR):\n    $e_{d,\\mathrm{MSR}} = (298\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\times (0.067\\,\\mathrm{kJ/(kg\\cdot K)}) = 19.966\\,\\mathrm{kJ/kg}$\n-   Low-pressure (LP) turbine:\n    $e_{d,\\mathrm{LP}} = (298\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\times (0.270\\,\\mathrm{kJ/(kg\\cdot K)}) = 80.46\\,\\mathrm{kJ/kg}$\n-   Condenser:\n    $e_{d,\\mathrm{Cond}} = (298\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\times (1.350\\,\\mathrm{kJ/(kg\\cdot K)}) = 402.3\\,\\mathrm{kJ/kg}$\n-   Pumps (combined):\n    $e_{d,\\mathrm{Pumps}} = (298\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\times (0.017\\,\\mathrm{kJ/(kg\\cdot K)}) = 5.066\\,\\mathrm{kJ/kg}$\n-   Feedwater heaters (FWH, combined):\n    $e_{d,\\mathrm{FWH}} = (298\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\times (0.1175\\,\\mathrm{kJ/(kg\\cdot K)}) = 35.015\\,\\mathrm{kJ/kg}$\n\n#### 2. Identification of Dominant Exergy Destruction\n\nBy comparing the calculated exergy destruction values, we can rank the components from highest to lowest loss:\n1.  Condenser: $402.3\\,\\mathrm{kJ/kg}$\n2.  Steam Generator: $201.15\\,\\mathrm{kJ/kg}$\n3.  LP Turbine: $80.46\\,\\mathrm{kJ/kg}$\n4.  HP Turbine: $59.6\\,\\mathrm{kJ/kg}$\n5.  Feedwater Heaters: $35.015\\,\\mathrm{kJ/kg}$\n6.  Moisture Separator Reheater: $19.966\\,\\mathrm{kJ/kg}$\n7.  Pumps: $5.066\\,\\mathrm{kJ/kg}$\n\nThe components with the dominant exergy destruction are the Condenser and the Steam Generator. This confirms the premise of the problem statement, which targets these two components for improvement.\n-   The high exergy destruction in the steam generator is due to the large temperature difference between the primary-side fluid and the secondary-side boiling water. A practical modification is to increase the heat transfer surface area, leading to a smaller terminal temperature difference and thus less irreversibility.\n-   The high exergy destruction in the condenser is due to the heat rejection process across the temperature difference between the condensing steam and the cooling water, which ultimately rejects heat to the environment. Lowering the condensing temperature (and pressure), for example, by using a larger or more efficient cooling tower, reduces this temperature difference and the associated irreversibility.\n\n#### 3. Calculation of the Increase in Cycle Exergy Efficiency\n\nThe exergy efficiency of the cycle is defined as:\n$$\\eta_{\\mathrm{ex}} = \\frac{w_{\\mathrm{net}}}{E_{Q,\\mathrm{in}}}$$\nFor a thermodynamic cycle operating at steady state, the exergy balance is expressed as:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{in}} = E_{\\mathrm{out}} + E_{\\mathrm{destroyed}}$$\nIn this case, the exergy input per unit mass is the exergy of the heat added from the primary side, $E_{Q,\\mathrm{in}}$. The exergy output per unit mass consists of the net work done, $w_{\\mathrm{net}}$, and the exergy of the heat rejected to the environment, $E_{Q,\\mathrm{out}}$. Since heat is rejected to the environment at temperature $T_0$, the exergy of this rejected heat is zero. The total exergy destroyed per unit mass is the sum of the destructions in all components, $E_{d,\\mathrm{total}} = \\sum_i e_{d,i}$.\nThe exergy balance simplifies to:\n$$E_{Q,\\mathrm{in}} = w_{\\mathrm{net}} + E_{d,\\mathrm{total}}$$\nFrom this, the net work is $w_{\\mathrm{net}} = E_{Q,\\mathrm{in}} - E_{d,\\mathrm{total}}$. Substituting this into the efficiency definition:\n$$\\eta_{\\mathrm{ex}} = \\frac{E_{Q,\\mathrm{in}} - E_{d,\\mathrm{total}}}{E_{Q,\\mathrm{in}}} = 1 - \\frac{E_{d,\\mathrm{total}}}{E_{Q,\\mathrm{in}}}$$\nThe increase in exergy efficiency, $\\Delta\\eta_{\\mathrm{ex}}$, is the difference between the new efficiency ($\\eta_{\\mathrm{ex,new}}$) and the initial efficiency ($\\eta_{\\mathrm{ex,initial}}$):\n$$\\Delta\\eta_{\\mathrm{ex}} = \\eta_{\\mathrm{ex,new}} - \\eta_{\\mathrm{ex,initial}} = \\left(1 - \\frac{E_{d,\\mathrm{total,new}}}{E_{Q,\\mathrm{in}}}\\right) - \\left(1 - \\frac{E_{d,\\mathrm{total,initial}}}{E_{Q,\\mathrm{in}}}\\right) = \\frac{E_{d,\\mathrm{total,initial}} - E_{d,\\mathrm{total,new}}}{E_{Q,\\mathrm{in}}}$$\nThe Term $E_{d,\\mathrm{total,initial}} - E_{d,\\mathrm{total,new}}$ represents the total reduction in exergy destruction, which we denote as $\\Delta E_{d,\\mathrm{total}}$. This reduction comes solely from the improvements in the steam generator and the condenser.\n$$\\Delta E_{d,\\mathrm{total}} = \\Delta e_{d,\\mathrm{SG}} + \\Delta e_{d,\\mathrm{Cond}}$$\nThe reduction in exergy destruction for the steam generator is $18\\%$ of its initial value:\n$$\\Delta e_{d,\\mathrm{SG}} = 0.18 \\times e_{d,\\mathrm{SG,initial}} = 0.18 \\times (201.15\\,\\mathrm{kJ/kg}) = 36.207\\,\\mathrm{kJ/kg}$$\nThe reduction in exergy destruction for the condenser is $22\\%$ of its initial value:\n$$\\Delta e_{d,\\mathrm{Cond}} = 0.22 \\times e_{d,\\mathrm{Cond,initial}} = 0.22 \\times (402.3\\,\\mathrm{kJ/kg}) = 88.506\\,\\mathrm{kJ/kg}$$\nThe total reduction in exergy destruction is the sum of these two values:\n$$\\Delta E_{d,\\mathrm{total}} = 36.207\\,\\mathrm{kJ/kg} + 88.506\\,\\mathrm{kJ/kg} = 124.713\\,\\mathrm{kJ/kg}$$\nThis reduction in exergy destruction is equal to the increase in net work output, $\\Delta w_{\\mathrm{net}}$. The increase in cycle exergy efficiency is therefore:\n$$\\Delta\\eta_{\\mathrm{ex}} = \\frac{\\Delta E_{d,\\mathrm{total}}}{E_{Q,\\mathrm{in}}} = \\frac{124.713\\,\\mathrm{kJ/kg}}{1350\\,\\mathrm{kJ/kg}}$$\n$$\\Delta\\eta_{\\mathrm{ex}} = 0.09238$$\nThe problem requires the answer as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $0.09238$ has four significant figures (9, 2, 3, 8). Thus, no further rounding is necessary.",

The provided data are dimensionally consistent and physically plausible for a large commercial nuclear power plant. The problem is well-posed, with a clear objective and sufficient data to derive a unique solution. The language is objective and unambiguous. The problem does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds by completing the four tasks outlined in the problem statement to arrive at the final required value.\n\n1.  To determine the rate of thermal energy transferred to the turbine cycle from secondary-side measurements, we apply the first law of thermodynamics for an open system at steady state to the secondary side of the steam generator. This rate, denoted $\\dot{Q}_{SG,sec}$, is the heat transferred from the primary coolant to the feedwater/steam. Assuming negligible changes in kinetic and potential energy and no work done, the energy balance is:\n    $$\\dot{Q}_{SG,sec} = \\dot{m}_{out}h_{out} - \\dot{m}_{in}h_{in}$$\n    At steady state, the mass flow rate is constant, $\\dot{m}_{in} = \\dot{m}_{out} = \\dot{m}_{\\mathrm{FW}}$. The inlet enthalpy is $h_{\\mathrm{FW}}$ and the outlet enthalpy is $h_{\\mathrm{ST}}$.\n    $$\\dot{Q}_{SG,sec} = \\dot{m}_{\\mathrm{FW}}(h_{\\mathrm{ST}} - h_{\\mathrm{FW}})$$\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$\\dot{Q}_{SG,sec} = (1.90 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{kg/s}) \\times (3.000 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{kJ/kg} - 1.350 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{kJ/kg})$$\n    $$\\dot{Q}_{SG,sec} = (1.90 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{kg/s}) \\times (1.650 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{kJ/kg})$$\n    $$\\dot{Q}_{SG,sec} = 3.135 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{kJ/s} = 3135\\ \\mathrm{MW}$$\n    This is the thermal power transferred to the turbine cycle.\n\n2.  To determine the reactor core thermal power from primary-side calorimetry, we apply the first law to the reactor coolant flowing through the core. This power is denoted $\\dot{Q}_{core}$. For a single-phase fluid, the change in enthalpy can be approximated as $\\Delta h = c_p \\Delta T$.\n    $$\\dot{Q}_{core} = \\dot{m}_{\\mathrm{RCS}} c_{p,\\mathrm{RCS}} (T_{\\mathrm{hot}} - T_{\\mathrm{cold}})$$\n    The temperature difference $\\Delta T$ is $325^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} - 294^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} = 31^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, which is equivalent to a difference of $31\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n    Substituting the given values:\n    $$\\dot{Q}_{core} = (2.30 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\mathrm{kg/s}) \\times (4.7\\ \\mathrm{kJ/(kg\\cdot K)}) \\times (31\\ \\mathrm{K})$$\n    $$\\dot{Q}_{core} = 3.3509 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{kJ/s} = 3350.9\\ \\mathrm{MW}$$\n\n3.  An overall energy balance on the primary system dictates that the heat generated in the core must equal the heat transferred to the secondary system plus any heat losses from the primary loop. The secondary-side calorimetry is typically considered more accurate. The reconciled core power, $\\dot{Q}_{core,reconciled}$, should therefore be:\n    $$\\dot{Q}_{core,reconciled} = \\dot{Q}_{SG,sec} + \\dot{Q}_{\\mathrm{loss,pri}}$$\n    $$\\dot{Q}_{core,reconciled} = 3135\\ \\mathrm{MW} + 25\\ \\mathrm{MW} = 3160\\ \\mathrm{MW}$$\n    There is a discrepancy between the primary-side measurement ($\\dot{Q}_{core} = 3350.9\\ \\mathrm{MW}$) and the reconciled value ($\\dot{Q}_{core,reconciled} = 3160\\ \\mathrm{MW}$). To reconcile these, a multiplicative bias factor $k$ on the primary mass flow measurement is inferred. The corrected power calculation must equal the reconciled power:\n    $$k \\cdot \\dot{Q}_{core} = \\dot{Q}_{core,reconciled}$$\n    $$k = \\frac{\\dot{Q}_{core,reconciled}}{\\dot{Q}_{core}} = \\frac{3160\\ \\mathrm{MW}}{3350.9\\ \\mathrm{MW}} \\approx 0.9430$$\n    This implies the measured primary flow rate is approximately $6\\%$ higher than the true value.\n\n4.  The plant heat rate ($HR$) is defined as the ratio of the thermal energy transferred to the turbine cycle to the net electrical energy produced. The \"reconciled\" heat rate uses the more reliable secondary-side thermal power measurement, $\\dot{Q}_{SG,sec}$, as the thermal input to the cycle.\n    The net electrical power output, $\\dot{P}_{net}$, is the gross output minus auxiliary consumption:\n    $$\\dot{P}_{net} = P_{\\mathrm{gross}} - P_{\\mathrm{aux}} = 995\\ \\mathrm{MW} - 25\\ \\mathrm{MW} = 970\\ \\mathrm{MW}$$\n    The heat rate in units of $\\mathrm{kJ/kWh}$ is calculated as:\n    $$HR = \\frac{\\text{Thermal power to cycle } [\\mathrm{kW}]}{\\text{Net electrical power } [\\mathrm{kW}]} \\times 3600 \\frac{\\mathrm{s}}{\\mathrm{h}}$$\n    $$HR = \\frac{\\dot{Q}_{SG,sec}}{\\dot{P}_{net}} \\times 3600$$\n    Both power terms can be expressed in megawatts, as the ratio is dimensionless.\n    $$HR = \\frac{3135\\ \\mathrm{MW}}{970\\ \\mathrm{MW}} \\times 3600 = 11635.0515...\\ \\mathrm{kJ/kWh}$$\n    Rounding to four significant figures as requested:\n    $$HR \\approx 11640\\ \\mathrm{kJ/kWh}$$\n    Expressed in standard scientific notation, this is $1.164 \\times 10^4\\ \\mathrm{kJ/kWh}$.",
