The contribution is $0$.\n- For $m=8$: $8 \\pmod{8} = 0$. The contribution is $\\epsilon_{8}$.\n- For $m=12$: $12 \\pmod{8} = 4 \\ne 0$. The contribution is $0$.\n\nThus, the total relative error is simply the sum of the contributing terms:\n$$\\mathcal{E}(8) = 0 + \\epsilon_{8} + 0 = \\epsilon_{8}$$\nSubstituting the given value $\\epsilon_{8} = 0.06$:\n$$\\mathcal{E}(8) = 0.06$$\nThe problem requires this answer to be expressed as a decimal fraction rounded to four significant figures. The number $0.06$ has one significant figure. To express it with four significant figures, we add trailing zeros.\n$$\\mathcal{E}(8) = 0.06000$$",

We must calculate the scattering ratio for each region and find the maximum.\n\nFor region $1$:\nThe given cross sections are $\\Sigma_{t,1} = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and $\\Sigma_{s,1} = 1.08\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\nThe scattering ratio $c_1$ is:\n$$ c_1 = \\frac{\\Sigma_{s,1}}{\\Sigma_{t,1}} = \\frac{1.08}{1.2} = 0.9 $$\n\nFor region $2$:\nThe given cross sections are $\\Sigma_{t,2} = 0.8\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and $\\Sigma_{s,2} = 0.56\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\nThe scattering ratio $c_2$ is:\n$$ c_2 = \\frac{\\Sigma_{s,2}}{\\Sigma_{t,2}} = \\frac{0.56}{0.8} = 0.7 $$\n\nThe spectral radius for the entire system is the maximum of these values:\n$$ \\rho(\\mathcal{L}) = \\max(c_1, c_2) = \\max(0.9, 0.7) = 0.9 $$\nThis value, $\\rho(\\mathcal{L}) = 0.9$, is the factor by which the residual is reduced in each iteration.\n\nWe need to find the minimum number of iterations, $n$, such that the residual $R^{(n)}$ is less than a tolerance $\\varepsilon = 10^{-8}$. We are given that the initial residual is normalized to $R^{(0)} = 1$. The condition is:\n$$ R^{(n)} < \\varepsilon $$\nUsing the convergence relation:\n$$ [\\rho(\\mathcal{L})]^n R^{(0)} < \\varepsilon $$\nSubstituting the known values $\\rho(\\mathcal{L})=0.9$, $R^{(0)}=1$, and $\\varepsilon=10^{-8}$:\n$$ (0.9)^n \\cdot 1 < 10^{-8} $$\nTo solve for $n$, we take the natural logarithm of both sides of the inequality:\n$$ \\ln\\left((0.9)^n\\right) < \\ln(10^{-8}) $$\n$$ n \\ln(0.9) < -8 \\ln(10) $$\nSince $\\ln(0.9)$ is a negative number ($0.9 < 1$), we must reverse the inequality sign when dividing by it:\n$$ n > \\frac{-8 \\ln(10)}{\\ln(0.9)} $$\nNow we evaluate this expression numerically:\n$$ n > \\frac{-8 \\times 2.302585...}{-0.105360...} \\approx \\frac{18.42068}{0.105360} \\approx 174.8356 $$\nSince the number of iterations $n$ must be an integer, we must find the smallest integer that is strictly greater than $174.8356$.\n$$ n = \\lceil 174.8356 \\rceil = 175 $$\nThus, a minimum of $175$ iterations are required to achieve the desired tolerance.",
