The set is defined by 10 direction types per octant, with reflections creating the full-sphere set of $8 \\times 10 = 80$ directions.\n- **Direction Types (First Octant, cosines are positive)**:\n    - **Type A**: 1 direction $\\vec{\\Omega} = (p, p, p)$ with $3p^2=1$.\n    - **Type B**: 3 directions, being the permutations of $(u, u, v)$ with $2u^2+v^2=1$.

Specific values given: $a=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{10}}$, $b=\\sqrt{\\frac{3}{10}}$, $c=\\sqrt{\\frac{6}{10}}$.\n- **Weights**: Nonnegative weights $w_A$, $w_B$, $w_C$ are associated with each direction of Type A, B, and C, respectively. The weight is the same for all directions of the same type and across all octants.\n- **Weight Normalization**: The sum of all weights over the unit sphere is $\\sum_{i} w_{i} = 8(w_{A}+3w_{B}+6w_{C}) = 4\\pi$.\n- **Discrete Second-Moment Tensor**: $\\mathbf{T} = \\sum_{i} w_{i}\\,\\vec{\\Omega}_{i}\\,\\vec{\\Omega}_{i}$, where $\\vec{\\Omega}_{i}$ are the unit direction vectors and $\\vec{\\Omega}_{i}\\,\\vec{\\Omega}_{i}$ is the outer product.\n- **Isotropy Error Tensor**: $\\Delta = \\mathbf{T} - \\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\,\\mathbf{I}$.\n- **Required Output**: The Frobenius norm of the error, $\\|\\Delta\\|_{F} = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{tr}(\\Delta^{\\mathsf{T}}\\Delta)}$.\n- **Constraint**: The computation must use \"only the constraints stated above and symmetry arguments\".\n\n#### Step 1.2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem is based on established principles of neutron transport theory and numerical methods used in reactor physics. Level-Symmetric quadrature sets are standard tools. The definitions and concepts are factually sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem provides all necessary definitions. Although the individual weights $w_A, w_B, w_C$ are not determined by the single normalization equation, the problem asks to compute $\\mathbf{T}$ using symmetry arguments. As will be shown, the structure of the problem allows for the unique determination of $\\mathbf{T}$ and, consequently, $\\|\\Delta\\|_F$, without needing the individual weight values. The problem is self-contained and a unique solution exists.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective mathematical and physical language.\n\n#### Step 1.3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. The provided numerical data, while partially redundant for the final answer, are consistent and define a concrete physical problem. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Solution\n\nThe objective is to compute the Frobenius norm of the isotropy error tensor, $\\|\\Delta\\|_{F}$. This requires first computing the discrete second-moment tensor $\\mathbf{T}$.\n\nThe discrete second-moment tensor $\\mathbf{T}$ is a $3 \\times 3$ matrix defined as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{T} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{i} \\vec{\\Omega}_{i} \\vec{\\Omega}_{i}\n$$\nwhere $N=80$ is the total number of directions. The vector $\\vec{\\Omega}_{i} = (\\mu_{ix}, \\mu_{iy}, \\mu_{iz})$ is the unit vector for the $i$-th direction. The components of the tensor are given by:\n$$\nT_{jk} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{i} \\mu_{ij} \\mu_{ik}\n$$\nfor $j, k \\in \\{x, y, z\\}$.\n\nWe will use the symmetry properties of the quadrature set, as stipulated by the problem.\n\n#### Off-Diagonal Components of $\\mathbf{T}$\nConsider an off-diagonal component, for instance, $T_{xy}$:\n$$\nT_{xy} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{i} \\mu_{ix} \\mu_{iy}\n$$\nThe full-sphere quadrature set is constructed by including, for any direction $(\\mu_x, \\mu_y, \\mu_z)$ in the first octant, all eight directions of the form $(\\pm \\mu_x, \\pm \\mu_y, \\pm \\mu_z)$. By construction, the weight $w_i$ is identical for these eight symmetric directions.\nLet's consider the contribution to the sum from a direction $\\vec{\\Omega} = (\\mu_x, \\mu_y, \\mu_z)$ from the first octant and its reflection across the $yz$-plane, $\\vec{\\Omega}' = (-\\mu_x, \\mu_y, \\mu_z)$. They have the same weight $w$. Their combined contribution to $T_{xy}$ is:\n$$\nw (\\mu_x \\mu_y) + w (-\\mu_x \\mu_y) = 0\n$$\nSince the entire set of $N=80$ directions can be partitioned into such pairs that cancel each other's contribution to the sum, the total sum is zero. The same argument holds if we reflect across the $xz$-plane (where $\\mu_y \\to -\\mu_y$) or the $xy$-plane (where $\\mu_z \\to -\\mu_z$). Thus, all off-diagonal components of $\\mathbf{T}$ are zero:\n$$\nT_{xy} = T_{yx} = 0, \\quad T_{xz} = T_{zx} = 0, \\quad T_{yz} = T_{zy} = 0\n$$\nThis demonstrates that $\\mathbf{T}$ is a diagonal matrix.\n\n#### Diagonal Components of $\\mathbf{T}$\nNow, let's examine the diagonal components, $T_{xx}$, $T_{yy}$, and $T_{zz}$.\n$$\nT_{xx} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{i} \\mu_{ix}^{2}\n$$\n$$\nT_{yy} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{i} \\mu_{iy}^{2}\n$$\n$$\nT_{zz} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{i} \\mu_{iz}^{2}\n$$\nThe first-octant set of directions is constructed from permutations: one direction of type $(p,p,p)$, three of type $(u,u,v)$, and six of type $(a,b,c)$. This base set of 10 directions is invariant under any permutation of the coordinate axes. For example, if $(\\mu_x, \\mu_y, \\mu_z)$ is a direction of a certain type (e.g., Type C), then $(\\mu_y, \\mu_x, \\mu_z)$ is also a direction of the same type and thus has the same weight. This permutation symmetry of the first-octant directions, combined with the reflectional symmetry used to generate the full set, implies that the full set of $N=80$ directions is invariant under coordinate permutation.\nConsequently, upon swapping the $x$ and $y$ axes, the sum for $T_{xx}$ must transform into the sum for $T_{yy}$. Since the set of vectors and weights is invariant under this transformation, the value of the sum must remain the same. Therefore, $T_{xx} = T_{yy}$. Similarly, by permuting other axes, we find:\n$$\nT_{xx} = T_{yy} = T_{zz}\n$$\nLet's call this common value $k$. The tensor $\\mathbf{T}$ is therefore isotropic:\n$$\n\\mathbf{T} = k \\mathbf{I} = \\begin{pmatrix} k & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & k & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & k \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nTo determine the value of $k$, we use the trace of the tensor $\\mathbf{T}$. The trace of $\\mathbf{T} = k\\mathbf{I}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{T}) = k + k + k = 3k\n$$\nAlternatively, we can compute the trace from the fundamental definition of $\\mathbf{T}$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{T}) = \\mathrm{tr}\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{i} \\vec{\\Omega}_{i} \\vec{\\Omega}_{i}\\right) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{i} \\mathrm{tr}(\\vec{\\Omega}_{i} \\vec{\\Omega}_{i})\n$$\nThe trace of an outer product $\\vec{v}\\vec{v}^{\\mathsf{T}}$ is the dot product $\\vec{v} \\cdot \\vec{v} = |\\vec{v}|^2$. Since each $\\vec{\\Omega}_i$ is a unit vector, $|\\vec{\\Omega}_i|^2 = 1$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{T}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{i} (1) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{i}\n$$\nThe problem provides the normalization constraint for the sum of the weights:\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_{i} = 4\\pi\n$$\nEquating the two expressions for the trace gives:\n$$\n3k = 4\\pi \\implies k = \\frac{4\\pi}{3}\n$$\nThus, the discrete second-moment tensor is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{T} = \\frac{4\\pi}{3} \\mathbf{I}\n$$\nThis result is a direct consequence of the symmetry of the quadrature set construction and holds irrespective of the specific values of the weights $w_A, w_B, w_C$ or the direction cosine components $p, u, v, a, b, c$, as long as they adhere to the specified symmetry structure. The specific numerical values provided for the direction cosines are consistent with the unit vector constraints and serve to define a concrete example of such a set, but they are not required for this calculation.\n\n#### Isotropy Error and Frobenius Norm\nThe isotropy error tensor $\\Delta$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\mathbf{T} - \\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\,\\mathbf{I}\n$$\nSubstituting our result for $\\mathbf{T}$:\n$$\n\\Delta = \\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\mathbf{I} - \\frac{4\\pi}{3}\\mathbf{I} = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{0}$ is the zero tensor.\n\nFinally, we compute the Frobenius norm of $\\Delta$:\n$$\n\\|\\Delta\\|_{F} = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{tr}(\\Delta^{\\mathsf{T}}\\Delta)} = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{0}^{\\mathsf{T}}\\mathbf{0})} = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{0})} = \\sqrt{0} = 0\n$$\nThe Frobenius norm of the error is zero. This signifies that the specified LS$_8$ quadrature set structure inherently and exactly preserves the second angular moment of an isotropic function, a key property for accurately modeling isotropic scattering in neutron transport simulations.",

We will compute $Q$ and $I$ separately and then find their difference.\n\nFirst, we determine the value of the quadrature weight, $w$.

Due to the symmetry of the sphere, integrals of cross-terms are zero, and integrals of squared terms are equal:\n$$\n\\int_{\\mathbb{S}^2} \\Omega_i \\Omega_j \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega = \\frac{4\\pi}{3} \\delta_{ij}\n$$\nwhere $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for $I[f]$:\n$$\nI[f] = \\sum_{i,j} A_{ij} \\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{3} \\delta_{ij}\\right) = \\frac{4\\pi}{3} \\sum_i A_{ii} = \\frac{4\\pi}{3} \\text{Tr}(A)\n$$\nThe matrix $A$ is given as:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix}\n2 & 1 & 1/2 \\\\\n1 & 3 & -1 \\\\\n1/2 & -1 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe trace of $A$ is $\\text{Tr}(A) = 2 + 3 + 1 = 6$.\nTherefore, the exact integral is:\n$$\nI[f] = \\frac{4\\pi}{3} (6) = 8\\pi\n$$\n\n**Step 2: Calculation of the Quadrature Sum $Q_{S_2}[f_R]$**\n\nThe rotated function is $f_R(\\vec{\\Omega}) = f(R\\vec{\\Omega}) = (R\\vec{\\Omega})^\\top A (R\\vec{\\Omega}) = \\vec{\\Omega}^\\top (R^\\top AR) \\vec{\\Omega}$. Let the rotated coefficient matrix be $A_R = R^\\top AR$. The problem requires the explicit construction of $f_R(\\vec{\\Omega})$ in terms of $A_R$.\n\nThe rotation matrix $R$ for $\\theta = \\pi/4$ is:\n$$\nR = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\pi/4) & -\\sin(\\pi/4) & 0 \\\\ \\sin(\\pi/4) & \\cos(\\pi/4) & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} & 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nWe compute $A_R = R^\\top AR$:\n$$\nA_R = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/\\sqrt{2} & 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \\\\ -1/\\sqrt{2} & 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 & 1/2 \\\\ 1 & 3 & -1 \\\\ 1/2 & -1 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1/\\sqrt{2} & -1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \\\\ 1/\\sqrt{2} & 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nPerforming the matrix multiplication:\n$$\nA_R = \\begin{pmatrix} 1/\\sqrt{2} & 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \\\\ -1/\\sqrt{2} & 1/\\sqrt{2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 3/\\sqrt{2} & -1/\\sqrt{2} & 1/2 \\\\ 4/\\sqrt{2} & 2/\\sqrt{2} & -1 \\\\ -1/(2\\sqrt{2}) & -3/(2\\sqrt{2}) & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nA_R = \\begin{pmatrix} (3/2+4/2) & (-1/2+2/2) & (1/(2\\sqrt{2}) - 1/\\sqrt{2}) \\\\ (-3/2+4/2) & (1/2+2/2) & (-1/(2\\sqrt{2}) - 1/\\sqrt{2}) \\\\ -1/(2\\sqrt{2}) & -3/(2\\sqrt{2}) & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 7/2 & 1/2 & -1/(2\\sqrt{2}) \\\\ 1/2 & 3/2 & -3/(2\\sqrt{2}) \\\\ -1/(2\\sqrt{2}) & -3/(2\\sqrt{2}) & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nA_R = \\begin{pmatrix} 3.5 & 0.5 & -\\sqrt{2}/4 \\\\ 0.5 & 1.5 & -3\\sqrt{2}/4 \\\\ -\\sqrt{2}/4 & -3\\sqrt{2}/4 & 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe quadrature sum is $Q_{S_2}[f_R] = \\sum_{k=1}^{8} w \\, f_R(\\vec{\\Omega}_k) = w \\sum_{k=1}^{8} \\vec{\\Omega}_k^\\top A_R \\vec{\\Omega}_k$.\n\nThe problem states that the quadrature is normalized such that $\\sum_{k=1}^{8} w = 4\\pi$. Since all weights $w$ are equal, we have $8w = 4\\pi$, which gives $w = \\pi/2$.\n\nThe $S_2$ quadrature points are the $8$ vectors formed by all sign permutations of $(\\mu, \\mu, \\mu)$, where $\\mu=1/\\sqrt{3}$. For any point $\\vec{\\Omega}_k$, the components satisfy $\\Omega_{k,i}^2 = \\mu^2 = 1/3$.\n\nThe sum is:\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{8} \\vec{\\Omega}_k^\\top A_R \\vec{\\Omega}_k = \\sum_{k=1}^{8} \\sum_{i,j} (A_R)_{ij} \\Omega_{k,i} \\Omega_{k,j} = \\sum_{i,j} (A_R)_{ij} \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^{8} \\Omega_{k,i} \\Omega_{k,j} \\right)\n$$\nLet's evaluate the moments of the quadrature points. For the diagonal terms ($i=j$):\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{8} \\Omega_{k,i}^2 = \\sum_{k=1}^{8} (1/\\sqrt{3})^2 = 8 \\times (1/3) = 8/3 \\quad \\text{for } i \\in \\{x,y,z\\}\n$$\nFor the off-diagonal terms ($i \\neq j$), by symmetry of the point set under sign changes, the sum is zero. For example, for each point $(\\Omega_x, \\Omega_y, \\Omega_z)$, the point $(-\\Omega_x, \\Omega_y, \\Omega_z)$ is also in the set. Their contributions to the sum $\\sum \\Omega_x \\Omega_y$ cancel. Thus:\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{8} \\Omega_{k,i} \\Omega_{k,j} = 0 \\quad \\text{for } i \\neq j\n$$\nSubstituting these moment values back into the sum:\n$$\n\\sum_{k=1}^{8} \\vec{\\Omega}_k^\\top A_R \\vec{\\Omega}_k = \\sum_i (A_R)_{ii} \\left(\\frac{8}{3}\\right) = \\frac{8}{3} \\text{Tr}(A_R)\n$$\nThe quadrature sum is therefore:\n$$\nQ_{S_2}[f_R] = w \\left( \\frac{8}{3} \\text{Tr}(A_R) \\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\cdot \\frac{8}{3} \\text{Tr}(A_R) = \\frac{4\\pi}{3} \\text{Tr}(A_R)\n$$\nA fundamental property of the trace is its invariance under cyclic permutations: $\\text{Tr}(XYZ) = \\text{Tr}(ZXY)$.\nThus, $\\text{Tr}(A_R) = \\text{Tr}(R^\\top AR) = \\text{Tr}(RR^\\top A)$. Since $R$ is a rotation matrix, $RR^\\top = I$ (the identity matrix).\nSo, $\\text{Tr}(A_R) = \\text{Tr}(IA) = \\text{Tr}(A) = 6$.\nThis can also be verified by summing the diagonal elements of the computed $A_R$ matrix: $\\text{Tr}(A_R) = 7/2 + 3/2 + 1 = 10/2 + 1 = 6$.\n\nSubstituting the trace value, we get:\n$$\nQ_{S_2}[f_R] = \\frac{4\\pi}{3} (6) = 8\\pi\n$$\n\n**Step 3: Calculation of the Absolute Error $E$**\nThe absolute error is given by $E = |Q_{S_2}[f_R] - I[f]|$.\nUsing the results from the previous steps:\n$$\nE = |8\\pi - 8\\pi| = 0\n$$\nThe error is exactly zero. This result is expected from the principles of quadrature design. The function $f(\\vec{\\Omega})$ is a polynomial of total degree $2$ in the components of $\\vec{\\Omega}$. The rotated function $f_R(\\vec{\\Omega})$ is also a polynomial of degree $2$. Level-symmetric S$_N$ quadratures, for $N \\ge 2$, are constructed to be exact for the integrals of all polynomials up to degree $2$ (and degree $3$ as well). This is equivalent to matching the moments $\\int \\Omega_i \\Omega_j d\\Omega$ exactly, as demonstrated in our calculation. Therefore, the quadrature formula yields the exact integral for any quadratic form, including $f$ and $f_R$. The requirement to round the final answer is satisfied by the exact value $0$.",
