            "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional, steady-state multigroup neutron balance for group $g$, formulated by integrating the angular neutron transport equation over direction and over the energy bounds of group $g$. The fundamental balance states that the rate of neutron loss due to interactions in group $g$ plus streaming is balanced by all sources into group $g$, including external sources and scattering from all groups. Let the scalar flux in group $g$ be $ \\phi_{g}(\\mathbf{r}) $, the total macroscopic cross section be $ \\Sigma_{t,g} $, and the zeroth-order Legendre moment of the scattering transfer cross section from group $g'$ to group $g$ be $ \\Sigma_{s,0}^{g' \\to g} $.

It is a standard problem in nuclear reactor physics, requiring the application of fundamental definitions from multigroup transport theory. All necessary data and definitions are provided. The problem is therefore valid for solution.\n\nThe task is to derive an expression for the group removal cross section $\\Sigma_{r,g}$, compute its value for group $1$ given specific data, and explain its physical significance.\n\nFirst, we establish the steady-state neutron balance equation for energy group $g$. As stated in the problem, the rate of loss (streaming and interactions) is balanced by the rate of production (scattering from other groups and external/fission sources). This can be written symbolically as:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J}_g(\\mathbf{r}) + \\Sigma_{t,g} \\phi_g(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_{g'=1}^{G} \\Sigma_{s,0}^{g' \\to g} \\phi_{g'}(\\mathbf{r}) + Q_g(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\nHere, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J}_g(\\mathbf{r})$ is the net leakage or streaming term, $\\Sigma_{t,g} \\phi_g(\\mathbf{r})$ is the total interaction rate in group $g$, the summation term is the total rate of scattering into group $g$ from all groups $g'$, and $Q_g(\\mathbf{r})$ represents all other sources, such as fission. The total number of energy groups is $G$.\n\nThe problem defines the group removal cross section, $\\Sigma_{r,g}$, as the coefficient of the flux $\\phi_g$ on the left-hand side of the equation after the within-group scattering term (or self-scattering term), $\\Sigma_{s,0}^{g \\to g} \\phi_g(\\mathbf{r})$, has been moved from the right-hand side to the left-hand side.\n\nTo perform this operation, we first separate the self-scattering term from the scattering source sum:\n$$\n\\sum_{g'=1}^{G} \\Sigma_{s,0}^{g' \\to g} \\phi_{g'}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\Sigma_{s,0}^{g \\to g} \\phi_{g}(\\mathbf{r}) + \\sum_{g' \\neq g, g'=1}^{G} \\Sigma_{s,0}^{g' \\to g} \\phi_{g'}(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the balance equation gives:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J}_g(\\mathbf{r}) + \\Sigma_{t,g} \\phi_g(\\mathbf{r}) = \\Sigma_{s,0}^{g \\to g} \\phi_{g}(\\mathbf{r}) + \\sum_{g' \\neq g} \\Sigma_{s,0}^{g' \\to g} \\phi_{g'}(\\mathbf{r}) + Q_g(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\nNow, we move the self-scattering term to the left-hand side as specified by the definition:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J}_g(\\mathbf{r}) + \\Sigma_{t,g} \\phi_g(\\mathbf{r}) - \\Sigma_{s,0}^{g \\to g} \\phi_{g}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_{g' \\neq g} \\Sigma_{s,0}^{g' \\to g} \\phi_{g'}(\\mathbf{r}) + Q_g(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\nWe can combine the terms that multiply $\\phi_g(\\mathbf{r})$ on the left-hand side:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J}_g(\\mathbf{r}) + \\left(\\Sigma_{t,g} - \\Sigma_{s,0}^{g \\to g}\\right) \\phi_g(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_{g' \\neq g} \\Sigma_{s,0}^{g' \\to g} \\phi_{g'}(\\mathbf{r}) + Q_g(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\nBy definition, the coefficient of $\\phi_g(\\mathbf{r})$ in this rearranged equation is the group removal cross section, $\\Sigma_{r,g}$. Therefore, by inspection, we obtain the desired expression:\n$$\n\\Sigma_{r,g} = \\Sigma_{t,g} - \\Sigma_{s,0}^{g \\to g}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nNext, we compute the value of $\\Sigma_{r,1}$ for a two-group material with the given data:\n$\\Sigma_{t,1} = 1.0\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$\n$\\Sigma_{s,0}^{1 \\to 1} = 0.8\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$\n\nUsing the derived formula for $g=1$:\n$$\n\\Sigma_{r,1} = \\Sigma_{t,1} - \\Sigma_{s,0}^{1 \\to 1}\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\n\\Sigma_{r,1} = 1.0\\,\\text{cm}^{-1} - 0.8\\,\\text{cm}^{-1} = 0.2\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}\n$$\n\nFinally, we explain the physical significance of $\\Sigma_{r,g}$. To do this, we decompose the total cross section, $\\Sigma_{t,g}$, into its components: absorption ($\\Sigma_{a,g}$) and total scattering ($\\Sigma_{s,g}$).\n$$\n\\Sigma_{t,g} = \\Sigma_{a,g} + \\Sigma_{s,g}\n$$\nThe total scattering cross section from group $g$, $\\Sigma_{s,g}$, is the sum of scattering to all possible final groups $g'$:\n$$\n\\Sigma_{s,g} = \\sum_{g'=1}^{G} \\Sigma_{s,0}^{g \\to g'} = \\Sigma_{s,0}^{g \\to g} + \\sum_{g' \\neq g} \\Sigma_{s,0}^{g \\to g'}\n$$\nSubstituting these relations into our expression for $\\Sigma_{r,g}$:\n$$\n\\Sigma_{r,g} = (\\Sigma_{a,g} + \\Sigma_{s,g}) - \\Sigma_{s,0}^{g \\to g} = \\Sigma_{a,g} + \\left( \\Sigma_{s,0}^{g \\to g} + \\sum_{g' \\neq g} \\Sigma_{s,0}^{g \\to g'} \\right) - \\Sigma_{s,0}^{g \\to g}\n$$\nThe self-scattering terms cancel, yielding:\n$$\n\\Sigma_{r,g} = \\Sigma_{a,g} + \\sum_{g' \\neq g} \\Sigma_{s,0}^{g \\to g'}\n$$\nThis expression clarifies the physical meaning. The removal cross section $\\Sigma_{r,g}$ represents the total probability per unit path length for a neutron in group $g$ to be removed from that group, either by being absorbed ($\\Sigma_{a,g}$) or by scattering into any other energy group $g' \\neq g$ (out-scattering). A within-group scattering event does not remove the neutron from its energy group, which is why $\\Sigma_{s,0}^{g \\to g}$ is subtracted from the total cross section $\\Sigma_{t,g}$.\n\nFor the specific case of the two-group problem, the removal cross section for group $1$ is:\n$$\n\\Sigma_{r,1} = \\Sigma_{a,1} + \\Sigma_{s,0}^{1 \\to 2}\n$$\nOur computed value, $\\Sigma_{r,1} = 0.2\\,\\text{cm}^{-1}$, is the sum of the macroscopic cross section for absorption in group $1$ and the macroscopic cross section for scattering from group $1$ to group $2$. The value $\\Sigma_{r,1}$ aggregates these two distinct removal mechanisms. Without additional information, such as the value of $\\Sigma_{a,1}$ or $\\Sigma_{s,0}^{1 \\to 2}$, it is impossible to determine the individual contribution of each process to the total removal from group $1$.",

The effective cross section is defined by $R_a = N \\sigma_{a,g}^*(\\sigma_0) \\Phi_g$, which implies:\n$$\n\\sigma_{a,g}^{*}(\\sigma_0) = \\frac{\\int_g \\sigma_a(E)\\phi(E)\\,\\mathrm{d}E}{\\int_g \\phi(E)\\,\\mathrm{d}E}\n$$\nTranslating these integrals into sums using the probability table formalism, we replace the integral over energy with a sum over the discrete states $i$, weighted by their probabilities $p_i$. The flux in state $i$ is proportional to $1/(\\sigma_{t,i} + \\sigma_0)$.\n$$\n\\sigma_{a,g}^{*}(\\sigma_0) = \\frac{\\sum_{i} p_i \\sigma_{a,i} \\left(\\frac{C}{\\sigma_{t,i}+\\sigma_0}\\right)}{\\sum_{i} p_i \\left(\\frac{C}{\\sigma_{t,i}+\\sigma_0}\\right)}\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a proportionality constant that cancels out. The final expression for the self-shielded absorption cross section is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{a,g}^{*}(\\sigma_0) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{3} p_i \\frac{\\sigma_{a,i}}{\\sigma_{t,i}+\\sigma_0}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{3} p_i \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{t,i}+\\sigma_0}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given values:\n$p_1 = 0.25$, $\\sigma_{a,1} = 120$, $\\sigma_{t,1} = 400$.\n$p_2 = 0.50$, $\\sigma_{a,2} = 20$, $\\sigma_{t,2} = 100$.\n$p_3 = 0.25$, $\\sigma_{a,3} = 5$, $\\sigma_{t,3} = 15$.\n$\\sigma_0 = 50$. All cross sections are in barns.\n\nThe numerator is:\n$$\n\\text{Num} = p_1\\frac{\\sigma_{a,1}}{\\sigma_{t,1}+\\sigma_0} + p_2\\frac{\\sigma_{a,2}}{\\sigma_{t,2}+\\sigma_0} + p_3\\frac{\\sigma_{a,3}}{\\sigma_{t,3}+\\sigma_0}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Num} = 0.25\\frac{120}{400+50} + 0.50\\frac{20}{100+50} + 0.25\\frac{5}{15+50}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Num} = 0.25\\frac{120}{450} + 0.50\\frac{20}{150} + 0.25\\frac{5}{65}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Num} = \\frac{1}{4}\\frac{4}{15} + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{2}{15} + \\frac{1}{4}\\frac{1}{13} = \\frac{1}{15} + \\frac{1}{15} + \\frac{1}{52} = \\frac{2}{15} + \\frac{1}{52} = \\frac{104 + 15}{780} = \\frac{119}{780}\n$$\nThe denominator is:\n$$\n\\text{Den} = p_1\\frac{1}{\\sigma_{t,1}+\\sigma_0} + p_2\\frac{1}{\\sigma_{t,2}+\\sigma_0} + p_3\\frac{1}{\\sigma_{t,3}+\\sigma_0}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Den} = 0.25\\frac{1}{450} + 0.50\\frac{1}{150} + 0.25\\frac{1}{65}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Den} = \\frac{1}{4}\\frac{1}{450} + \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{1}{150} + \\frac{1}{4}\\frac{1}{65} = \\frac{1}{1800} + \\frac{1}{300} + \\frac{1}{260} = \\frac{7}{1800} + \\frac{1}{260}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Den} = \\frac{7 \\cdot 13 + 1 \\cdot 90}{23400} = \\frac{91+90}{23400} = \\frac{181}{23400}\n$$\nSo, the effective cross section is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{a,g}^{*}(\\sigma_0) = \\frac{\\text{Num}}{\\text{Den}} = \\frac{119/780}{181/23400} = \\frac{119}{780} \\cdot \\frac{23400}{181} = \\frac{119 \\cdot 30}{181} = \\frac{3570}{181} \\approx 19.72376\\,\\text{barns}\n$$\nNext, we determine the infinite-dilution cross section, $\\sigma_{a,g}^{\\infty}$. This corresponds to the limit $\\sigma_0 \\to \\infty$. In this limit, the flux depression effect vanishes because the background cross section dominates the total cross section, making it nearly constant across all resonant states. The flux becomes \"flat\" and does not depend on the nuclide's own cross section.\n$$\n\\sigma_{a,g}^{\\infty} = \\lim_{\\sigma_0\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\sum_{i} p_i \\frac{\\sigma_{a,i}}{\\sigma_{t,i}+\\sigma_0}}{\\sum_{i} p_i \\frac{1}{\\sigma_{t,i}+\\sigma_0}} = \\frac{\\sum_{i} p_i \\sigma_{a,i} \\lim_{\\sigma_0\\to\\infty}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sigma_{t,i}+\\sigma_0}\\right)}{\\sum_{i} p_i \\lim_{\\sigma_0\\to\\infty}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sigma_{t,i}+\\sigma_0}\\right)} = \\frac{\\sum_i p_i \\sigma_{a,i}}{\\sum_i p_i}\n$$\nSince $\\sum_i p_i = 1$, the infinite-dilution cross section is simply the probability-weighted average of the microscopic absorption cross sections:\n$$\n\\sigma_{a,g}^{\\infty} = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} p_i \\sigma_{a,i}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{a,g}^{\\infty} = (0.25)(120) + (0.50)(20) + (0.25)(5) = 30 + 10 + 1.25 = 41.25\\,\\text{barns}\n$$\nFinally, the Bondarenko self-shielding factor $B(\\sigma_0)$ is the ratio of the effective (self-shielded) cross section to the infinite-dilution cross section.\n$$\nB(\\sigma_0) = \\frac{\\sigma_{a,g}^{*}(\\sigma_0)}{\\sigma_{a,g}^{\\infty}}\n$$\n$$\nB(50) = \\frac{3570/181}{41.25} = \\frac{19.72376...}{41.25} \\approx 0.4781515...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $0.4782$.\nThe self-shielding factor is less than $1$, which is expected. The presence of the absorber nuclide at finite concentration depresses the flux at energies where its cross section is high, reducing the overall effective reaction rate compared to the unshielded (infinite dilution) case.",
