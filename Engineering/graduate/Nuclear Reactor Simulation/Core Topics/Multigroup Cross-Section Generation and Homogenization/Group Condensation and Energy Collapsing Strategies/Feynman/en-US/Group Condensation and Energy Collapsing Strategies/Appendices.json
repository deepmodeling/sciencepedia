            "problem": "A fuel-moderator lattice is modeled for group condensation of an isolated s-wave resonance under the narrow resonance approximation, in order to study how energy collapsing responds to changes in the Dancoff factor. Consider a single resonance absorber uniformly distributed in cylindrical fuel pins embedded in moderator. The absorber has a single narrow rectangular resonance in lethargy, of height (microscopic absorption cross section) $\\,\\sigma_{r}\\,$ and lethargy width $\\,\\Delta u\\,$. The infinite-dilution resonance integral in this simplified representation is then $\\,I_{\\infty} = \\sigma_{r}\\,\\Delta u\\,$. Outside the resonance interval, assume a stationary slowing-down spectrum with flux proportional to $\\,1/E\\,$ in lethargy and a background that is represented by a constant microscopic background cross section $\\,\\sigma_{b}\\,$ over the resonance width.

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the change in the effective resonance integral, $\\Delta I$, resulting from a change in the Dancoff factor, $C$. The solution is based on the narrow resonance (NR) approximation for a heterogeneous system.\n\nFirst, we establish the expression for the neutron flux within the fuel. Under the narrow resonance approximation, neutrons that scatter within the resonance are assumed to be scattered to an energy outside the resonance width. The source of neutrons entering the resonance is therefore determined by the constant slowing-down source from higher energies. In a heterogeneous lattice, this source is due to potential scattering within the fuel pin and neutrons entering the fuel pin from the moderator. The balance equation for the flux per unit lethargy, $\\phi(u)$, is given by the source term divided by the total removal rate.\n\nThe total removal cross section per absorber atom is $\\sigma_t(u) = \\sigma_a(u) + \\sigma_p + \\sigma_e$, where $\\sigma_a(u)$ is the absorption cross section at lethargy $u$, $\\sigma_p$ is the potential scattering cross section of the absorber, and $\\sigma_e$ is the effective escape cross section representing leakage to the moderator. The source term per absorber atom is proportional to the background cross section, $\\sigma_b = \\sigma_p + \\sigma_e$, multiplied by the asymptotic flux that would exist in the absence of the resonance, $\\phi_0$.\n\nThe flux inside the fuel is thus depressed from the asymptotic value $\\phi_0$ by the self-shielding effect:\n$$\n\\phi(u) = \\frac{\\sigma_p + \\sigma_e}{\\sigma_a(u) + \\sigma_p + \\sigma_e} \\phi_0 = \\frac{\\sigma_b}{\\sigma_a(u) + \\sigma_b} \\phi_0\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the background cross section, $\\sigma_b$, is dependent on the Dancoff factor $C$, which accounts for the reduced probability of a neutron escaping one fuel pin reaching the moderator before entering another pin. The given relation is:\n$$\n\\sigma_b(C) = \\sigma_p + (1 - C) \\sigma_e\n$$\nThe effective resonance integral, $I_{\\text{eff}}$, is defined such that the total absorption rate in the resonance per absorber atom is $R_a = I_{\\text{eff}} \\phi_0$. In terms of lethargy, it is given by:\n$$\nI_{\\text{eff}} = \\int_{\\text{res}} \\sigma_a(u) \\frac{\\phi(u)}{\\phi_0} du\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the flux, we get:\n$$\nI_{\\text{eff}}(C) = \\int_{\\text{res}} \\sigma_a(u) \\frac{\\sigma_b(C)}{\\sigma_a(u) + \\sigma_b(C)} du\n$$\nThe problem models the resonance as a rectangular function in lethargy. The microscopic absorption cross section is $\\sigma_a(u) = \\sigma_r$ over a lethargy width of $\\Delta u$, and zero otherwise. Within this interval, the integrand is constant. The integral thus simplifies to the product of the integrand and the interval width:\n$$\nI_{\\text{eff}}(C) = \\sigma_r \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_b(C)}{\\sigma_r + \\sigma_b(C)} \\right) \\Delta u\n$$\nWe recognize that the infinite-dilution resonance integral is $I_{\\infty} = \\sigma_r \\Delta u$. This corresponds to the case of extreme dilution where $\\sigma_b \\to \\infty$, and the shielding factor approaches $1$. We can therefore write the effective resonance integral as:\n$$\nI_{\\text{eff}}(C) = I_{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_b(C)}{\\sigma_r + \\sigma_b(C)} \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\sigma_b(C)$ yields the final functional form for $I_{\\text{eff}}(C)$:\n$$\nI_{\\text{eff}}(C) = I_{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_p + (1 - C) \\sigma_e}{\\sigma_r + \\sigma_p + (1 - C) \\sigma_e} \\right)\n$$\nWe are given the following values: $\\sigma_r = 2000$, $\\Delta u = 0.06$, $\\sigma_p = 7$, and $\\sigma_e = 50$. All cross sections are in units of barns.\n\nFirst, we compute the infinite-dilution resonance integral:\n$$\nI_{\\infty} = \\sigma_r \\Delta u = (2000)(0.06) = 120 \\, \\text{barns}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the background cross section $\\sigma_b(C)$ for the two specified Dancoff factors, $C=0.2$ and $C=0.6$.\n\nFor $C = 0.2$:\n$$\n\\sigma_b(0.2) = \\sigma_p + (1 - 0.2) \\sigma_e = 7 + (0.8)(50) = 7 + 40 = 47 \\, \\text{barns}\n$$\nFor $C = 0.6$:\n$$\n\\sigma_b(0.6) = \\sigma_p + (1 - 0.6) \\sigma_e = 7 + (0.4)(50) = 7 + 20 = 27 \\, \\text{barns}\n$$\nNow, we can compute the effective resonance integral for each case.\n\nFor $C = 0.2$:\n$$\nI_{\\text{eff}}(0.2) = I_{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_b(0.2)}{\\sigma_r + \\sigma_b(0.2)} \\right) = 120 \\left( \\frac{47}{2000 + 47} \\right) = 120 \\left( \\frac{47}{2047} \\right) \\approx 2.75525 \\, \\text{barns}\n$$\nFor $C = 0.6$:\n$$\nI_{\\text{eff}}(0.6) = I_{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_b(0.6)}{\\sigma_r + \\sigma_b(0.6)} \\right) = 120 \\left( \\frac{27}{2000 + 27} \\right) = 120 \\left( \\frac{27}{2027} \\right) \\approx 1.59842 \\, \\text{barns}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the change $\\Delta I = I_{\\text{eff}}(0.6) - I_{\\text{eff}}(0.2)$.\n$$\n\\Delta I = 120 \\left( \\frac{27}{2027} \\right) - 120 \\left( \\frac{47}{2047} \\right) = 1.59842... - 2.75525... = -1.156830... \\, \\text{barns}\n$$\nThe increase in the Dancoff factor from $0.2$ to $0.6$ signifies stronger shielding among fuel pins, which reduces the effectiveness of the moderator in diluting the resonance absorber. This increases the flux depression (self-shielding) and thus decreases the effective resonance integral. The negative sign of $\\Delta I$ is therefore physically consistent.\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\n\\Delta I \\approx -1.157 \\, \\text{barns}\n$$",

            "problem": "You are tasked with deriving and implementing an energy group condensation procedure for Mixed Oxide (MOX) fuel few-group constants in a nuclear reactor simulation context, comparing the use of neutron spectra from a heterogeneous lattice versus a homogeneous cell, with explicit handling of resonance self-shielding differences. The goal is to compute condensed macroscopic two-group constants for absorption and neutron-yield-weighted fission from provided fine-group microscopic data, isotope number densities, and flux spectra. The computation must be based on first principles, preserving reaction rates when collapsing energy groups, and must produce results in units of inverse centimeters ($\\text{cm}^{-1}$), formatted and rounded as specified.\n\nFundamental base and core definitions:\n- The steady-state Boltzmann transport equation relates neutron flux to material properties and sources. The reaction rate density for a reaction with microscopic cross section is the integral of neutron flux over energy multiplied by the cross section. Let $E$ denote energy, $\\phi(E)$ the neutron flux, $\\sigma_x(E)$ a microscopic cross section for reaction $x$, $N$ an atomic number density, and $\\Sigma_x(E)$ the macroscopic cross section. The reaction rate density is $R_x = \\int \\phi(E) \\Sigma_x(E) \\,\\mathrm{d}E$, where $\\Sigma_x(E) = \\sum_i N_i \\sigma_{x,i}(E)$, and the sum runs over isotopes $i$. In discrete energy groups, the integral is replaced by a sum over fine groups. Energy collapsing from fine groups to few groups must preserve the same reaction rate density within each collapsed group. In practical heterogeneous lattices, unresolved and resolved resonance absorption (notably in Uranium-238) leads to depressed flux in resonance energy ranges and reduced effective microscopic cross sections, represented by self-shielding factors obtained from lattice physics (for example, through Dancoff-corrected models). These factors differ between heterogeneous lattices and homogeneous cells and must be applied consistently to the affected isotope in the resonance energy range before condensation.\n\nData to be used:\n- Fine-group structure: there are $8$ fine energy groups, indexed by $g \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\\}$, ordered from highest energy ($g=0$) to lowest energy ($g=7$). You will condense to $2$ groups: a fast group with indices $g \\in \\{0,1,2,3,4\\}$ and a thermal group with indices $g \\in \\{5,6,7\\}$.\n- Isotopes included in the MOX fuel mixture: Plutonium-239 (Pu-239), Plutonium-240 (Pu-240), Plutonium-241 (Pu-241), Uranium-238 (U-238).\n- Atomic number densities $N_i$ (in atoms per cubic centimeter) for isotopes $i$:\n  - Pu-239: $1.5\\times 10^{21}$\n  - Pu-240: $0.6\\times 10^{21}$\n  - Pu-241: $0.3\\times 10^{21}$\n  - U-238: $2.0\\times 10^{21}$\n- Microscopic absorption cross sections $\\sigma_{a,i,g}$ (in barns) for each isotope $i$ and fine group $g$ (listed by isotope with the $8$ group values in order $g=0$ to $g=7$):\n  - Pu-239: $(0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 5.0, 200.0, 600.0, 800.0)$\n  - Pu-240: $(0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 50.0, 80.0, 100.0)$\n  - Pu-241: $(0.4, 0.6, 1.2, 2.5, 5.0, 250.0, 500.0, 700.0)$\n  - U-238: $(0.3, 0.4, 3.0, 5.0, 2.5, 0.6, 0.3, 0.2)$\n- Microscopic neutron-yield-weighted fission cross sections $\\nu\\sigma_{f,i,g}$ (in barns) for each isotope $i$ and fine group $g$:\n  - Pu-239: $(0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 2.0, 900.0, 1500.0, 1700.0)$\n  - Pu-240: $(0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 2.0, 2.0, 3.0)$\n  - Pu-241: $(0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.5, 1000.0, 1600.0, 1800.0)$\n  - U-238: $(0.1, 0.08, 0.05, 0.02, 0.01, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)$\n- Self-shielding treatment: Apply self-shielding factors only to Uranium-238 absorption $\\sigma_{a,\\text{U-238},g}$ prior to building macroscopic absorption. For non-resonant groups, set factor to $1$. For resonant groups, use factors as specified in each test case. No self-shielding is applied to $\\nu\\sigma_f$ in this problem.\n\nUnit conversions:\n- Use $1$ barn $= 10^{-24}$ $\\text{cm}^2$. When computing macroscopic cross sections, multiply microscopic cross sections by the corresponding number densities and convert to inverse centimeters: $\\Sigma_{x,g} = \\sum_i N_i \\sigma_{x,i,g} \\times 10^{-24}$.\n\nCondensation requirement:\n- Starting from the definition of reaction rate density in a discrete group representation, energy collapsing to a few groups must preserve the reaction rate density $R_x$ within each condensed group. That is, the condensed macroscopic cross section in a few group, when multiplied by the total flux in that few group, must equal the sum of reaction rates over the fine groups that compose it.

Let $G$ denote a coarse energy group, which is a set of fine energy groups $\\{g\\}$. The reaction rate, $R_x$, for a reaction type $x$ in a group is the product of the macroscopic cross section $\\Sigma_x$ and the neutron flux $\\phi$. In a discrete group structure, the total reaction rate over the set of fine groups comprising $G$ is given by the sum:\n$$ R_{x,G}^{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{g \\in G} R_{x,g} = \\sum_{g \\in G} \\Sigma_{x,g} \\phi_g $$\nwhere $\\Sigma_{x,g}$ is the macroscopic cross section for reaction $x$ in fine group $g$, and $\\phi_g$ is the neutron flux in fine group $g$.\n\nAfter condensation, this total reaction rate must be conserved. The condensed coarse-group cross section, $\\Sigma_{x,G}$, is defined such that it yields the same total reaction rate when multiplied by the total flux in the coarse group, $\\Phi_G$:\n$$ R_{x,G}^{\\text{total}} = \\Sigma_{x,G} \\Phi_G $$\nThe total flux in the coarse group, $\\Phi_G$, is the sum of the fluxes in the constituent fine groups:\n$$ \\Phi_G = \\sum_{g \\in G} \\phi_g $$\nBy equating the two expressions for the total reaction rate, we can solve for the condensed cross section $\\Sigma_{x,G}$:\n$$ \\Sigma_{x,G} = \\frac{\\sum_{g \\in G} \\Sigma_{x,g} \\phi_g}{\\sum_{g \\in G} \\phi_g} $$\nThis is the fundamental formula for flux-weighted group condensation. It will be used to compute the two-group (fast and thermal) constants.\n\nThe computational procedure for each test case is as follows:\n\n1.  **Calculate Fine-Group Macroscopic Cross Sections ($\\Sigma_{x,g}$)**\n    For each of the $8$ fine groups, the macroscopic cross section for a reaction type $x$ (either absorption, $a$, or neutron-yield-weighted fission, $\\nu f$) is calculated by summing the contributions from all isotopes $i$:\n    $$ \\Sigma_{x,g} = \\left( \\sum_i N_i \\sigma_{x,i,g} \\right) \\times C $$\n    where $N_i$ is the atomic number density for isotope $i$, $\\sigma_{x,i,g}$ is its microscopic cross section in group $g$, and $C = 10^{-24}$ is the conversion factor from barns to cm$^2$.\n\n    For the absorption cross section, $\\sigma_{a,g}$, the self-shielding factor $S_g$ for Uranium-238 must be applied:\n    $$ \\sigma'_{a,\\text{U-238},g} = S_g \\times \\sigma_{a,\\text{U-238},g} $$\n    The macroscopic absorption cross section is then:\n    $$ \\Sigma_{a,g} = \\left( N_{\\text{Pu-239}}\\sigma_{a,\\text{Pu-239},g} + N_{\\text{Pu-240}}\\sigma_{a,\\text{Pu-240},g} + N_{\\text{Pu-241}}\\sigma_{a,\\text{Pu-241},g} + N_{\\text{U-238}}\\sigma'_{a,\\text{U-238},g} \\right) \\times 10^{-24} $$\n    For the neutron-yield-weighted fission cross section, $\\nu\\Sigma_{f,g}$, no self-shielding is applied:\n    $$ \\nu\\Sigma_{f,g} = \\left( \\sum_i N_i (\\nu\\sigma_{f,i,g}) \\right) \\times 10^{-24} $$\n    This calculation is performed for both the heterogeneous and homogeneous scenarios, using the respective self-shielding factors.\n\n2.  **Condense to Two-Group Cross Sections**\n    The fine groups are partitioned into a fast group $G_{\\text{fast}} = \\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\\}$ and a thermal group $G_{\\text{thermal}} = \\{5, 6, 7\\}$. The condensation formula is applied to each group and reaction type, using the appropriate flux spectrum ($\\phi^{\\text{het}}_g$ or $\\phi^{\\text{hom}}_g$).\n\n    - **Fast Group Absorption Cross Section ($\\Sigma_{a,\\text{fast}}$)**:\n      $$ \\Sigma_{a,\\text{fast}} = \\frac{\\sum_{g=0}^{4} \\Sigma_{a,g} \\phi_g}{\\sum_{g=0}^{4} \\phi_g} $$\n    - **Thermal Group Absorption Cross Section ($\\Sigma_{a,\\text{thermal}}$)**:\n      $$ \\Sigma_{a,\\text{thermal}} = \\frac{\\sum_{g=5}^{7} \\Sigma_{a,g} \\phi_g}{\\sum_{g=5}^{7} \\phi_g} $$\n    The same formulas are used for the neutron-yield-weighted fission cross sections, $\\nu\\Sigma_{f,\\text{fast}}$ and $\\nu\\Sigma_{f,\\text{thermal}}$.\n\nThis procedure will be implemented for all four test cases, generating a set of $8$ condensed macroscopic constants for each. The final values will be rounded to $6$ decimal places as specified.",

In multi-group form, these moments are integrated across incident and outgoing energy bins to produce fine-group moments $\\Sigma_{s,ij}^{(l)}$.\n\nWhen collapsing multiple fine groups into a single broad group $G$, the flux-weighted condensation principle provides the collapsed $l$-th moment as the ratio of the reaction rate associated with that moment to the total flux in the broad group.

Physically, a higher $\\xi_{G}$ indicates more forward-peaked scattering after collapse, diminishing angular randomization and increasing the propensity for neutrons to stream, which is captured by an increased diffusion coefficient. Conversely, a lower $\\xi_{G}$ reflects more isotropic scattering, raising $\\Sigma_{tr,G}$ and decreasing $D_{G}$. The computed value $\\xi_{G} = 0.7419$ indicates appreciable forward anisotropy in the collapsed group, and, all else equal, would lead to an increased collapsed diffusion coefficient compared to a more isotropic collapsed scattering (smaller $\\xi_{G}$).",
