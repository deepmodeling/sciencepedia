In a heterogeneous reactor lattice, the intense absorption in a fuel pin's resonance energies creates a localized flux depression, which is not captured by a simple homogeneous model. This exercise  provides a clear, quantitative look at how the geometric arrangement of the lattice, represented by the Dancoff factor $C$, directly alters the effective resonance integral. By working through a simplified narrow resonance model, you will build foundational intuition on how spatial effects influence the collapsed nuclear data used in reactor analysis.",

            "problem": "A fuel-moderator lattice is modeled for group condensation of an isolated s-wave resonance under the narrow resonance approximation, in order to study how energy collapsing responds to changes in the Dancoff factor.

            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the change in the effective resonance integral, $\\Delta I$, resulting from a change in the Dancoff factor, $C$. The solution is based on the narrow resonance (NR) approximation for a heterogeneous system.\n\nFirst, we establish the expression for the neutron flux within the fuel. Under the narrow resonance approximation, neutrons that scatter within the resonance are assumed to be scattered to an energy outside the resonance width. The source of neutrons entering the resonance is therefore determined by the constant slowing-down source from higher energies. In a heterogeneous lattice, this source is due to potential scattering within the fuel pin and neutrons entering the fuel pin from the moderator. The balance equation for the flux per unit lethargy, $\\phi(u)$, is given by the source term divided by the total removal rate.\n\nThe total removal cross section per absorber atom is $\\sigma_t(u) = \\sigma_a(u) + \\sigma_p + \\sigma_e$, where $\\sigma_a(u)$ is the absorption cross section at lethargy $u$, $\\sigma_p$ is the potential scattering cross section of the absorber, and $\\sigma_e$ is the effective escape cross section representing leakage to the moderator. The source term per absorber atom is proportional to the background cross section, $\\sigma_b = \\sigma_p + \\sigma_e$, multiplied by the asymptotic flux that would exist in the absence of the resonance, $\\phi_0$.\n\nThe flux inside the fuel is thus depressed from the asymptotic value $\\phi_0$ by the self-shielding effect:\n$$\n\\phi(u) = \\frac{\\sigma_p + \\sigma_e}{\\sigma_a(u) + \\sigma_p + \\sigma_e} \\phi_0 = \\frac{\\sigma_b}{\\sigma_a(u) + \\sigma_b} \\phi_0\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the background cross section, $\\sigma_b$, is dependent on the Dancoff factor $C$, which accounts for the reduced probability of a neutron escaping one fuel pin reaching the moderator before entering another pin. The given relation is:\n$$\n\\sigma_b(C) = \\sigma_p + (1 - C) \\sigma_e\n$$\nThe effective resonance integral, $I_{\\text{eff}}$, is defined such that the total absorption rate in the resonance per absorber atom is $R_a = I_{\\text{eff}} \\phi_0$. In terms of lethargy, it is given by:\n$$\nI_{\\text{eff}} = \\int_{\\text{res}} \\sigma_a(u) \\frac{\\phi(u)}{\\phi_0} du\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the flux, we get:\n$$\nI_{\\text{eff}}(C) = \\int_{\\text{res}} \\sigma_a(u) \\frac{\\sigma_b(C)}{\\sigma_a(u) + \\sigma_b(C)} du\n$$\nThe problem models the resonance as a rectangular function in lethargy. The microscopic absorption cross section is $\\sigma_a(u) = \\sigma_r$ over a lethargy width of $\\Delta u$, and zero otherwise. Within this interval, the integrand is constant. The integral thus simplifies to the product of the integrand and the interval width:\n$$\nI_{\\text{eff}}(C) = \\sigma_r \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_b(C)}{\\sigma_r + \\sigma_b(C)} \\right) \\Delta u\n$$\nWe recognize that the infinite-dilution resonance integral is $I_{\\infty} = \\sigma_r \\Delta u$. This corresponds to the case of extreme dilution where $\\sigma_b \\to \\infty$, and the shielding factor approaches $1$. We can therefore write the effective resonance integral as:\n$$\nI_{\\text{eff}}(C) = I_{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_b(C)}{\\sigma_r + \\sigma_b(C)} \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\sigma_b(C)$ yields the final functional form for $I_{\\text{eff}}(C)$:\n$$\nI_{\\text{eff}}(C) = I_{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_p + (1 - C) \\sigma_e}{\\sigma_r + \\sigma_p + (1 - C) \\sigma_e} \\right)\n$$\nWe are given the following values: $\\sigma_r = 2000$, $\\Delta u = 0.06$, $\\sigma_p = 7$, and $\\sigma_e = 50$. All cross sections are in units of barns.\n\nFirst, we compute the infinite-dilution resonance integral:\n$$\nI_{\\infty} = \\sigma_r \\Delta u = (2000)(0.06) = 120 \\, \\text{barns}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the background cross section $\\sigma_b(C)$ for the two specified Dancoff factors, $C=0.2$ and $C=0.6$.\n\nFor $C = 0.2$:\n$$\n\\sigma_b(0.2) = \\sigma_p + (1 - 0.2) \\sigma_e = 7 + (0.8)(50) = 7 + 40 = 47 \\, \\text{barns}\n$$\nFor $C = 0.6$:\n$$\n\\sigma_b(0.6) = \\sigma_p + (1 - 0.6) \\sigma_e = 7 + (0.4)(50) = 7 + 20 = 27 \\, \\text{barns}\n$$\nNow, we can compute the effective resonance integral for each case.\n\nFor $C = 0.2$:\n$$\nI_{\\text{eff}}(0.2) = I_{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_b(0.2)}{\\sigma_r + \\sigma_b(0.2)} \\right) = 120 \\left( \\frac{47}{2000 + 47} \\right) = 120 \\left( \\frac{47}{2047} \\right) \\approx 2.75525 \\, \\text{barns}\n$$\nFor $C = 0.6$:\n$$\nI_{\\text{eff}}(0.6) = I_{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{\\sigma_b(0.6)}{\\sigma_r + \\sigma_b(0.6)} \\right) = 120 \\left( \\frac{27}{2000 + 27} \\right) = 120 \\left( \\frac{27}{2027} \\right) \\approx 1.59842 \\, \\text{barns}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the change $\\Delta I = I_{\\text{eff}}(0.6) - I_{\\text{eff}}(0.2)$.\n$$\n\\Delta I = 120 \\left( \\frac{27}{2027} \\right) - 120 \\left( \\frac{47}{2047} \\right) = 1.59842... - 2.75525... = -1.156830... \\, \\text{barns}\n$$\nThe increase in the Dancoff factor from $0.2$ to $0.6$ signifies stronger shielding among fuel pins, which reduces the effectiveness of the moderator in diluting the resonance absorber. This increases the flux depression (self-shielding) and thus decreases the effective resonance integral. The negative sign of $\\Delta I$ is therefore physically consistent.\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\n\\Delta I \\approx -1.157 \\, \\text{barns}\n$$",

A nominal $95\\%$ confidence interval would be $\\widehat{\\Sigma}_{a,G} \\pm z_{0.975} \\sqrt{\\operatorname{Var}(\\widehat{\\Sigma}_{a,G})}$, where $z_{0.975}$ is the $97.5\\%$ standard normal quantile.\n\n**3. Log-Transform Regularized Lower Endpoint**\n\nThe problem asks for the calculation of a regularized lower $95\\%$ confidence endpoint using a log-transform:\n$$\n\\Sigma_{L}^{(\\log)} \\equiv \\widehat{\\Sigma}_{a,G}\\,\\exp\\!\\Big(-z_{0.975}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\operatorname{Var}(\\widehat{\\Sigma}_{a,G})}{\\widehat{\\Sigma}_{a,G}^{2}}}\\Big)\n$$\nThe term under the square root is the relative variance of the estimator. Using our derived expression for $\\operatorname{Var}(\\widehat{\\Sigma}_{a,G})$ and replacing the true moments with their plug-in estimates ($m_R, m_\\Phi, s_R, s_\\Phi, \\rho$):\n$$\n\\frac{\\operatorname{Var}(\\widehat{\\Sigma}_{a,G})}{\\widehat{\\Sigma}_{a,G}^{2}} \\approx \\frac{1}{N} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{s_R}{m_R}\\right)^2 - 2\\rho\\left(\\frac{s_R}{m_R}\\right)\\left(\\frac{s_\\Phi}{m_\\Phi}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{s_\\Phi}{m_\\Phi}\\right)^2 \\right]\n$$\nFirst, we compute the relative standard deviations from the provided sample statistics:\n$$\n\\frac{s_R}{m_R} = \\frac{3.00 \\times 10^{-4}}{2.00 \\times 10^{-4}} = 1.5\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{s_\\Phi}{m_\\Phi} = \\frac{1.60 \\times 10^{-3}}{1.00 \\times 10^{-3}} = 1.6\n$$\nNow, substitute these values into the relative variance expression:\n$$\n\\frac{\\operatorname{Var}(\\widehat{\\Sigma}_{a,G})}{\\widehat{\\Sigma}_{a,G}^{2}} \\approx \\frac{1}{8} \\left[ (1.5)^2 - 2(0.50)(1.5)(1.6) + (1.6)^2 \\right] = \\frac{1}{8} [2.25 - 2.4 + 2.56] = \\frac{2.41}{8} = 0.30125\n$$\nThe standard normal quantile is $z_{0.975} \\approx 1.95996$. We use this value to compute the exponential term's argument:\n$$\n-z_{0.975}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\operatorname{Var}(\\widehat{\\Sigma}_{a,G})}{\\widehat{\\Sigma}_{a,G}^{2}}} \\approx -1.95996 \\times \\sqrt{0.30125} \\approx -1.95996 \\times 0.54886 \\approx -1.07575\n$$\nFinally, we compute the regularized lower endpoint:\n$$\n\\Sigma_{L}^{(\\log)} \\approx 0.2 \\times \\exp(-1.07575) \\approx 0.2 \\times 0.34105 \\approx 0.06821\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested, the value is $0.0682$.\n\n**4. Discussion on Regularization**\n\nThe log-transform regularization constructs a confidence interval for $\\ln(\\widehat{\\Sigma}_{a,G})$, which is symmetric on the real number line, and then maps the interval back to the original scale via exponentiation, guaranteeing a strictly positive interval for $\\Sigma_{a,G}$. Alternative regularizations like truncation at zero are simpler but can perform poorly if the true value is near zero, while Bayesian methods with nonnegativity priors offer a more principled approach to incorporate physical constraints, especially for small sample sizes, at the cost of requiring a subjective prior specification.",
