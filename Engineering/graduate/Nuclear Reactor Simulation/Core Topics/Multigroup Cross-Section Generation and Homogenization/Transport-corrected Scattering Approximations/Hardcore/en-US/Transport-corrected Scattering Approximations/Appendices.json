It quantifies the total probability of a scattering event per unit path length. In the neutron transport equation, it appears in the scattering source term $\\Sigma_{s,0}\\phi_0$, providing the rate at which neutrons are isotropically scattered into any direction from the scalar flux $\\phi_0$.\n\n2.  $\\Sigma_{s,1}$: This is the first moment, directly related to the average cosine of the scattering angle, $\\bar{\\mu} = \\Sigma_{s,1} / \\Sigma_{s,0}$. It represents the degree of anisotropy in scattering, specifically the forward or backward bias. A positive $\\Sigma_{s,1}$ indicates predominantly forward scattering. In transport-corrected approximations, this moment is used to define the transport cross section, $\\Sigma_{tr} = \\Sigma_t - \\Sigma_{s,1}$ (where $\\Sigma_t$ is the total cross section). This correction effectively accounts for the anisotropic part of scattering by modifying the total removal cross section. This allows a simpler, isotropic scattering source model to be used with greater accuracy, especially in diffusion theory, by correctly modeling the net neutron current.\n\n3.  $\\Sigma_{s,2}$: This is the second moment, which provides a higher-order correction for the angular shape of the scattering distribution. While $\\Sigma_{s,1}$ captures linear anisotropy (forward/backward asymmetry), $\\Sigma_{s,2}$ captures quadratic features. It is essential in higher-order angular flux approximations, such as the $P_N$ method for $N \\ge 2$. In the hierarchy of moment equations for the angular flux, the $l$-th moment of the scattering cross section, $\\Sigma_{s,l}$, couples the various angular moments of the flux. The $\\Sigma_{s,2}$ term thus provides a more refined description of how scattering redistributes neutrons angularly, which is necessary for accurately predicting the flux distribution in problems where simple linear anisotropy is insufficient.\n\nThe computed expressions for the three moments are summarized in the final answer.",

The rate at which neutrons are removed from a group (by absorption or out-scattering) must be the same in both the original and corrected models.\n    $$ \\tilde{\\Sigma}_{r,g} = \\Sigma_{r,g} $$\n    Using the definitions of the removal cross sections, this becomes:\n    $$ \\tilde{\\Sigma}_{t,g} - \\tilde{\\Sigma}_{s,0}^{g \\leftarrow g} = \\Sigma_{t,g} - \\Sigma_{s,0}^{g \\leftarrow g} $$\n\nNow we solve for the corrected within-group isotropic scattering, $\\tilde{\\Sigma}_{s,0}^{g \\leftarrow g}$. We substitute the expression for $\\tilde{\\Sigma}_{t,g}$ from the first principle into the equation from the second principle:\n$$ (\\Sigma_{t,g} - \\Sigma_{s,1}^{g \\leftarrow g}) - \\tilde{\\Sigma}_{s,0}^{g \\leftarrow g} = \\Sigma_{t,g} - \\Sigma_{s,0}^{g \\leftarrow g} $$\nSolving for $\\tilde{\\Sigma}_{s,0}^{g \\leftarrow g}$:\n$$ -\\Sigma_{s,1}^{g \\leftarrow g} - \\tilde{\\Sigma}_{s,0}^{g \\leftarrow g} = -\\Sigma_{s,0}^{g \\leftarrow g} $$\n$$ \\tilde{\\Sigma}_{s,0}^{g \\leftarrow g} = \\Sigma_{s,0}^{g \\leftarrow g} - \\Sigma_{s,1}^{g \\leftarrow g} $$\nThe out-of-group scattering cross sections are unaffected by this correction: $\\tilde{\\Sigma}_{s,0}^{g' \\leftarrow g} = \\Sigma_{s,0}^{g' \\leftarrow g}$ for $g' \\neq g$.\n\n**Task 2: Apply the Mapping**\nWe apply these derived formulas to the given numerical data for each group. All units are in $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n\nFor Group $g=1$:\n- Given: $\\Sigma_{t,1} = 0.85$, $\\Sigma_{s,0}^{1 \\leftarrow 1} = 0.65$, $\\Sigma_{s,1}^{1 \\leftarrow 1} = 0.25$, $\\Sigma_{s,0}^{2 \\leftarrow 1} = 0.15$.\n- Corrected total cross section:\n$$ \\tilde{\\Sigma}_{t,1} = \\Sigma_{t,1} - \\Sigma_{s,1}^{1 \\leftarrow 1} = 0.85 - 0.25 = 0.60 $$\n- Corrected within-group isotropic scattering:\n$$ \\tilde{\\Sigma}_{s,0}^{1 \\leftarrow 1} = \\Sigma_{s,0}^{1 \\leftarrow 1} - \\Sigma_{s,1}^{1 \\leftarrow 1} = 0.65 - 0.25 = 0.40 $$\n- Corrected out-of-group scattering:\n$$ \\tilde{\\Sigma}_{s,0}^{2 \\leftarrow 1} = \\Sigma_{s,0}^{2 \\leftarrow 1} = 0.15 $$\n\nFor Group $g=2$:\n- Given: $\\Sigma_{t,2} = 0.60$, $\\Sigma_{s,0}^{2 \\leftarrow 2} = 0.45$, $\\Sigma_{s,1}^{2 \\leftarrow 2} = 0.20$, $\\Sigma_{s,0}^{1 \\leftarrow 2} = 0.05$.\n- Corrected total cross section:\n$$ \\tilde{\\Sigma}_{t,2} = \\Sigma_{t,2} - \\Sigma_{s,1}^{2 \\leftarrow 2} = 0.60 - 0.20 = 0.40 $$\n- Corrected within-group isotropic scattering:\n$$ \\tilde{\\Sigma}_{s,0}^{2 \\leftarrow 2} = \\Sigma_{s,0}^{2 \\leftarrow 2} - \\Sigma_{s,1}^{2 \\leftarrow 2} = 0.45 - 0.20 = 0.25 $$\n- Corrected out-of-group scattering:\n$$ \\tilde{\\Sigma}_{s,0}^{1 \\leftarrow 2} = \\Sigma_{s,0}^{1 \\leftarrow 2} = 0.05 $$\n\n**Task 3: Verify Preservation of Removal Cross Section**\nFirst, we verify analytically that the removal cross section is preserved by the derived mapping.\nThe corrected removal cross section is $\\tilde{\\Sigma}_{r,g} = \\tilde{\\Sigma}_{t,g} - \\tilde{\\Sigma}_{s,0}^{g \\leftarrow g}$.\nSubstituting the expressions for the corrected quantities:\n$$ \\tilde{\\Sigma}_{r,g} = (\\Sigma_{t,g} - \\Sigma_{s,1}^{g \\leftarrow g}) - (\\Sigma_{s,0}^{g \\leftarrow g} - \\Sigma_{s,1}^{g \\leftarrow g}) $$\n$$ \\tilde{\\Sigma}_{r,g} = \\Sigma_{t,g} - \\Sigma_{s,1}^{g \\leftarrow g} - \\Sigma_{s,0}^{g \\leftarrow g} + \\Sigma_{s,1}^{g \\leftarrow g} $$\n$$ \\tilde{\\Sigma}_{r,g} = \\Sigma_{t,g} - \\Sigma_{s,0}^{g \\leftarrow g} $$\nSince $\\Sigma_{r,g} \\equiv \\Sigma_{t,g} - \\Sigma_{s,0}^{g \\leftarrow g}$, we have proven that $\\tilde{\\Sigma}_{r,g} = \\Sigma_{r,g}$.\n\nNext, we verify this numerically.\nFor Group $1$:\n- Original removal cross section:\n$$ \\Sigma_{r,1} = \\Sigma_{t,1} - \\Sigma_{s,0}^{1 \\leftarrow 1} = 0.85 - 0.65 = 0.20 $$\n- Corrected removal cross section:\n$$ \\tilde{\\Sigma}_{r,1} = \\tilde{\\Sigma}_{t,1} - \\tilde{\\Sigma}_{s,0}^{1 \\leftarrow 1} = 0.60 - 0.40 = 0.20 $$\nThe values are identical, so $|\\tilde{\\Sigma}_{r,1} - \\Sigma_{r,1}| = 0.00$.\n\nFor Group $2$:\n- Original removal cross section:\n$$ \\Sigma_{r,2} = \\Sigma_{t,2} - \\Sigma_{s,0}^{2 \\leftarrow 2} = 0.60 - 0.45 = 0.15 $$\n- Corrected removal cross section:\n$$ \\tilde{\\Sigma}_{r,2} = \\tilde{\\Sigma}_{t,2} - \\tilde{\\Sigma}_{s,0}^{2 \\leftarrow 2} = 0.40 - 0.25 = 0.15 $$\nThe values are identical, so $|\\tilde{\\Sigma}_{r,2} - \\Sigma_{r,2}| = 0.00$.\n\n**Task 4: Compute Maximum Discrepancy**\nThe maximum absolute discrepancy in the removal cross section is defined as $\\Delta_{\\max} \\equiv \\max\\{|\\tilde{\\Sigma}_{r,1} - \\Sigma_{r,1}|, |\\tilde{\\Sigma}_{r,2} - \\Sigma_{r,2}|\\}$.\nUsing the results from Task $3$:\n$$ |\\tilde{\\Sigma}_{r,1} - \\Sigma_{r,1}| = |0.20 - 0.20| = 0 $$\n$$ |\\tilde{\\Sigma}_{r,2} - \\Sigma_{r,2}| = |0.15 - 0.15| = 0 $$\nTherefore,\n$$ \\Delta_{\\max} = \\max\\{0, 0\\} = 0 $$\nThe discrepancy is exactly zero, as required by the construction of the transport correction. The problem asks for the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. For a result of zero, this implies a high degree of precision in our finding that there is no discrepancy. It is best represented as $0.0000$.",
