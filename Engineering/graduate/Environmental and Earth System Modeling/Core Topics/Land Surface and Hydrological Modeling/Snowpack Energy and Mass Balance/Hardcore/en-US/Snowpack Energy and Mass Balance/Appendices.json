            "problem": "A snowpack control volume at a midlatitude alpine site is observed over the one-hour interval from local time $13{:}00$ to $14{:}00$. Assume the snowpack is isothermal at $0^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ so that all net energy input during this hour is available to produce melt, and neglect any change in internal energy storage other than melting. Use the First Law of Thermodynamics applied to a control volume to frame the energy conservation for the snowpack surface layer. Adopt the following sign convention: energy fluxes are positive when directed toward and into the snowpack. Under this convention, net radiation $R_{n}$ is positive when downward; sensible heat flux $H$ and latent heat flux $LE$ are positive when downward; ground (soil-to-snow) heat flux $G$ is positive when upward into the snowpack; and advected rain heat $P$ is positive when rain delivers heat into the snowpack.

A solution will be provided.\n\n**2. Derivation and Solution**\n\nThe problem is governed by the principle of energy conservation, an application of the First Law of Thermodynamics to the snowpack control volume. The change in the internal energy of the snowpack, $\\Delta U$, is equal to the net energy, $Q_{\\text{net}}$, transferred into it over a given time interval, $\\Delta t$.\n$$\n\\Delta U = Q_{\\text{net}}\n$$\nThe problem states that the snowpack is isothermal at $0^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ and that all net energy input is used to produce melt. Therefore, the net energy input is equivalent to the residual melt energy, $M$. The energy balance equation can be written for the total energy per unit area over the time interval $\\Delta t$.\n\nThe net energy, $M$, is the sum of all energy components transferred into the snowpack. The given energy fluxes, $R_n$, $H$, $LE$, and $G$, are rates of energy transfer per unit area, measured in Watts per square meter ($\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$), which is equivalent to Joules per second per square meter ($\\mathrm{J\\,s^{-1}\\,m^{-2}}$). To find the total energy from these fluxes over the one-hour interval, we must integrate them with respect to time. Since the fluxes are given as time-averaged values over the hour, the integration simplifies to a multiplication by the time interval, $\\Delta t$.\n\nThe advected heat from rain, $P_{\\text{hour}}$, is already provided as a time-integrated energy total for the hour, in units of Megajoules per square meter ($\\mathrm{MJ\\,m^{-2}}$).\n\nThe expression for the total melt energy $M$ is derived by summing the time-integrated flux components and the advected rain heat:\n$$\nM = \\left( \\int_{0}^{\\Delta t} (R_n + H + LE + G) \\, dt \\right) + P_{\\text{hour}}\n$$\nGiven that the fluxes are constant averages over the interval $\\Delta t$, the equation simplifies to:\n$$\nM = (R_n + H + LE + G) \\cdot \\Delta t + P_{\\text{hour}}\n$$\nThis is the derived expression for the residual melt energy. To compute its value, we must ensure all terms are in consistent units. The target unit is $\\mathrm{MJ\\,m^{-2}}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the sum of the best-estimate surface fluxes. Let this sum be $Q_{\\text{surf}}$.\n$$\nQ_{\\text{surf}} = R_n + H + LE + G\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nQ_{\\text{surf}} = 142\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}} + (-18\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}) + (-36\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}) + 12\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}\n$$\n$$\nQ_{\\text{surf}} = 142 - 18 - 36 + 12 = 100\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}\n$$\nThe positive result indicates a net flux of energy *into* the snowpack.\n\nNext, we convert this power flux into total energy per unit area over the one-hour interval. The time interval is $\\Delta t = 1\\,\\mathrm{hour}$. We must convert this to seconds to be compatible with the units of Watts ($\\mathrm{J\\,s^{-1}}$).\n$$\n\\Delta t = 1\\,\\mathrm{hour} \\times \\frac{3600\\,\\mathrm{s}}{1\\,\\mathrm{hour}} = 3600\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThe energy contribution from these fluxes, $E_{\\text{surf}}$, is:\n$$\nE_{\\text{surf}} = Q_{\\text{surf}} \\cdot \\Delta t = (100\\,\\mathrm{J\\,s^{-1}\\,m^{-2}}) \\times (3600\\,\\mathrm{s}) = 360000\\,\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-2}}\n$$\nNow, we convert $E_{\\text{surf}}$ from $\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-2}}$ to $\\mathrm{MJ\\,m^{-2}}$, using the conversion factor $1\\,\\mathrm{MJ} = 10^6\\,\\mathrm{J}$.\n$$\nE_{\\text{surf}} = 360000\\,\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-2}} \\times \\frac{1\\,\\mathrm{MJ}}{10^6\\,\\mathrm{J}} = 0.36\\,\\mathrm{MJ\\,m^{-2}}\n$$\nThe energy from advected rain heat, $P_{\\text{hour}}$, is already given in the correct units:\n$$\nP_{\\text{hour}} = 0.112\\,\\mathrm{MJ\\,m^{-2}}\n$$\nThe total residual melt energy, $M$, is the sum of these two components:\n$$\nM = E_{\\text{surf}} + P_{\\text{hour}} = 0.36\\,\\mathrm{MJ\\,m^{-2}} + 0.112\\,\\mathrm{MJ\\,m^{-2}} = 0.472\\,\\mathrm{MJ\\,m^{-2}}\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $0.472$ has three significant figures. To express this with four significant figures, a trailing zero must be added.\n$$\nM = 0.4720\\,\\mathrm{MJ\\,m^{-2}}\n$$\nThis value represents the best estimate for the total energy available for melting the snowpack during the specified hour.",

All provided data, including the values for energy fluxes ($R_{n}$, $H$, $LE$, $G$), snowpack properties ($h$, $\\rho$, $T_i$), and physical constants ($c_i$), are realistic and within typical ranges for the described environmental setting. The assumptions, such as a spatially uniform snowpack temperature and constant fluxes, provide a standard simplification for a lumped-parameter model. The definition of cold content is standard. The sign convention for fluxes might appear ambiguous at first glance, but the contextual descriptions clarify that positive fluxes represent energy gains for the snowpack, making the problem consistent and solvable. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds by applying the first law of thermodynamics, or the principle of conservation of energy, to the snowpack, which is treated as a control volume. The rate of change of internal energy per unit area, $\\frac{dU}{dt}$, of the snowpack is equal to the net energy flux per unit area, $Q_{net}$, entering the snowpack.\n$$ \\frac{dU}{dt} = Q_{net} $$\nThe net energy flux is the sum of the individual fluxes at the boundaries of the control volume: net radiation ($R_n$), sensible heat flux ($H$), latent heat flux ($LE$), and ground heat flux ($G$).\n$$ Q_{net} = R_n + H + LE + G $$\nUsing the provided values:\n$$ Q_{net} = (-80) + (+70) + (+20) + (+10)\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}} = 20\\ \\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}} $$\nSince $Q_{net}$ is positive, there is a net energy gain by the snowpack. The problem states that fluxes are stationary, so $Q_{net}$ is constant over time.\n\nThe problem defines the cold content per unit area, $CC$, as\n$$ CC \\equiv -\\int_{0}^{h} \\rho\\, c_{i}\\, T(z)\\, dz $$\nwhere $T(z)$ is the temperature in degrees Celsius (or kelvins relative to the freezing point). The internal energy per unit area, $U$, relative to a reference state of ice at $0^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$, is defined as\n$$ U \\equiv \\int_{0}^{h} \\rho\\, c_{i}\\, T(z)\\, dz $$\nFrom these definitions, it is clear that $U = -CC$. Substituting this relationship into the energy conservation equation gives the governing relation for the cold content:\n$$ \\frac{d(-CC)}{dt} = Q_{net} \\implies \\frac{d(CC)}{dt} = -Q_{net} $$\nTo find the total change in cold content over the duration of the night, we integrate this equation with respect to time from the initial time $t_i$ ($20:00$) to the final time $t_f$ ($08:00$).

All concepts used—Snow Water Equivalent (SWE), snowfall, rainfall, runoff, and refreezing—are standard in snow hydrology and environmental modeling. The provided data values are physically realistic for a mixed-phase storm event.\n\nA critical aspect of validation is to check the physical consistency of the provided data, as requested by the problem statement. The primary task is to compute the change in total mass (SWE), which depends on external fluxes (snow, rain, runoff). The internal process of refreezing ($F(t)$) and the state of the liquid water reservoir ($L(t)$) do not directly affect the total mass but must be consistent with the given runoff $Q(t)$.\n\nThe conservation of liquid water requires that the amount of liquid water removed from the snowpack (via runoff and refreezing) cannot exceed the amount available (initial liquid water plus rainfall). Let $L_k$ be the liquid water content in meters at the start of hour $k$. The liquid water balance over hour $k$ (with $\\Delta t=1$ h) is:\n$L_{k+1} = L_k + (I_{r,k} - Q_k - F_k) \\times 10^{-3} \\times \\Delta t$.\nFor this to be physically valid, $L_{k+1}$ must be non-negative. This is equivalent to checking if the total liquid water sinks $(Q_k + F_k)$ are less than or equal to the total liquid water sources $(L_k / (10^{-3} \\Delta t) + I_{r,k})$. A step-by-step check confirms this condition holds for all $6$ hours, meaning the liquid water balance does not violate mass conservation. For example, in hour 3, with high rainfall ($I_{r,3} = 3.0 \\ \\text{mm/h}$) and high runoff ($Q_3 = 2.2 \\ \\text{mm/h}$), the liquid content change is $(3.0 - 2.2 - 1.0) \\ \\text{mm} = -0.2 \\ \\text{mm}$. The initial liquid content at the start of hour 3 is calculated to be $0.0060 \\ \\text{m}$ or $6.0 \\ \\text{mm}$, so the final content is $5.8 \\ \\text{mm}$, which is positive and physically valid.\n\nThe problem states that runoff $Q(t)$ occurs in hours where a simple \"bucket\" model (where runoff only occurs if $L(t)  C(t) = \\alpha W(t)$) would predict zero runoff because the snowpack remains unsaturated. This does not represent a physical contradiction. Real snowpacks are heterogeneous, and phenomena like preferential flow through macropores can generate runoff before the entire snowpack matrix reaches its full liquid water holding capacity. Since the problem provides $Q(t)$ as an input, we are not required to model its generation mechanism, only to use it in the mass balance equation. The provided data is thus deemed consistent and plausible.\n\nThe problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution\nThe primary goal is to determine the total change in Snow Water Equivalent, $\\Delta W$, over the $T=6$ hour storm. SWE, $W(t)$, is defined as the total mass of water in the snowpack (ice and liquid) per unit area, divided by the density of water, $\\rho_w$.\n\nThe principle of conservation of mass for the snowpack control volume states that the rate of change of total mass is equal to the sum of mass fluxes into the volume minus the sum of mass fluxes out of the volume. Expressed per unit area, this is:\n$$ \\frac{d(W \\rho_w)}{dt} = J_s + J_r - J_Q $$\nwhere $J_s$ is the mass flux from snowfall, $J_r$ is the mass flux from rainfall, and $J_Q$ is the mass flux from runoff. Refreezing, $F(t)$, is an internal phase change from liquid to ice and does not alter the total mass, $W \\rho_w$.\n\nDividing by $\\rho_w$, we get the rate of change of SWE:\n$$ \\frac{dW}{dt} = \\frac{J_s}{\\rho_w} + \\frac{J_r}{\\rho_w} - \\frac{J_Q}{\\rho_w} $$\nThe terms must be in consistent units, for instance, meters per hour [m/h].\n- Snowfall: $J_s$ is in $\\text{kg} \\ \\text{m}^{-2} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}$. To convert to m/h:\n  $P_s(t) \\left[\\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{h}}\\right] = \\frac{J_s(t) [\\text{kg} \\ \\text{m}^{-2} \\ \\text{s}^{-1}]}{\\rho_w [\\text{kg} \\ \\text{m}^{-3}]} \\times 3600 \\left[\\frac{\\text{s}}{\\text{h}}\\right]$.\n  Given $\\rho_w = 1000 \\ \\text{kg} \\ \\text{m}^{-3}$, this simplifies to $P_s(t) = 3.6 J_s(t)$.\n- Rainfall: $I_r$ is in $\\text{mm} \\ \\text{h}^{-1}$. To convert to m/h:\n  $P_r(t) \\left[\\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{h}}\\right] = I_r(t) [\\text{mm} \\ \\text{h}^{-1}] \\times 10^{-3} \\left[\\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{mm}}\\right]$.\n- Runoff: $Q$ is in $\\text{mm} \\ \\text{h}^{-1}$. To convert to m/h:\n  $P_Q(t) \\left[\\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{h}}\\right] = Q(t) [\\text{mm} \\ \\text{h}^{-1}] \\times 10^{-3} \\left[\\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{mm}}\\right]$.\n\nThe total change in SWE, $\\Delta W$, is the integral of its rate of change over the storm duration $T$:\n$$ \\Delta W = \\int_0^T \\frac{dW}{dt} dt = \\int_0^T \\left( P_s(t) + P_r(t) - P_Q(t) \\right) dt $$\nSince the forcing rates are piecewise constant over $\\Delta t = 1$-hour intervals, the integral becomes a summation over the $N=6$ intervals:\n$$ \\Delta W = \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\left( P_{s,k} + P_{r,k} - P_{Q,k} \\right) \\Delta t $$\nWith $\\Delta t = 1$ h, the expression for $\\Delta W$ in meters is:\n$$ \\Delta W = \\sum_{k=1}^{6} \\left( 3.6 J_{s,k} + (I_{r,k} - Q_k) \\times 10^{-3} \\right) $$\nWe can compute the total contribution from each flux component over the $6$ hours.\n\nTotal contribution from snowfall:\n$\\Delta W_s = \\sum_{k=1}^{6} 3.6 J_{s,k} \\times \\Delta t = 3.6 \\times (2.5 \\times 10^{-4} + 3.0 \\times 10^{-4} + 0 + 4.0 \\times 10^{-4} + 2.0 \\times 10^{-5} + 1.5 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times 1$\n$\\Delta W_s = 3.6 \\times (2.5 + 3.0 + 0 + 4.0 + 0.2 + 1.5) \\times 10^{-4}$\n$\\Delta W_s = 3.6 \\times 11.2 \\times 10^{-4} = 40.32 \\times 10^{-4} = 0.004032 \\ \\text{m}$.\n\nTotal contribution from rainfall:\n$\\Delta W_r = \\sum_{k=1}^{6} I_{r,k} \\times 10^{-3} \\times \\Delta t = (1.2 + 0.8 + 3.0 + 0.5 + 1.5 + 0.0) \\times 10^{-3} \\times 1$\n$\\Delta W_r = 7.0 \\times 10^{-3} = 0.0070 \\ \\text{m}$.\n\nTotal contribution from runoff:\n$\\Delta W_Q = \\sum_{k=1}^{6} Q_k \\times 10^{-3} \\times \\Delta t = (0.2 + 0.1 + 2.2 + 0.1 + 0.9 + 0.0) \\times 10^{-3} \\times 1$\n$\\Delta W_Q = 3.5 \\times 10^{-3} = 0.0035 \\ \\text{m}$.\n\nThe net change in SWE is the sum of inputs minus the output:\n$\\Delta W = \\Delta W_s + \\Delta W_r - \\Delta W_Q$\n$\\Delta W = 0.004032 + 0.0070 - 0.0035$\n$\\Delta W = 0.004032 + 0.0035 = 0.007532 \\ \\text{m}$.\n\nThe final change in SWE over the $6$-hour storm is $0.007532$ meters of water equivalent. The problem asks for the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated value $0.007532$ already has four significant figures ($7$, $5$, $3$, $2$).",
