            "problem": "A saturated, homogeneous, and isotropic porous layer occupies a one-dimensional (1D) domain along a horizontal Cartesian coordinate $x \\in [0, L]$. The porous medium has constant hydraulic conductivity $K$ and is in steady state with no internal sources or sinks of water. The layer is in hydraulic contact at $x=0$ with a constant-head reservoir imposing hydraulic head $h(0)=h_A$, and at $x=L$ with another constant-head reservoir imposing hydraulic head $h(L)=h_B$. Assume the fluid is incompressible with constant density and viscosity, and neglect any variation in porosity. The specific discharge (also called Darcy flux) in the $x$ direction is denoted $q$ and is defined as volumetric flow per unit cross-sectional area normal to $x$.\n\nStarting only from local mass conservation for an incompressible fluid and Darcy’s law, derive the governing equation for the hydraulic head $h(x)$, solve for $h(x)$ subject to the boundary conditions, and then compute the uniform (in $x$) specific discharge $q$.

            "solution": "The problem is evaluated to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. All necessary principles and data for a unique solution are provided. The values are physically realistic for a hydrogeological context. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis begins with the fundamental principle of mass conservation for an incompressible fluid in a porous medium under steady-state conditions with no internal sources or sinks. This principle is expressed by the continuity equation, which states that the divergence of the specific discharge vector $\\mathbf{q}$ is zero:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} = 0\n$$\nFor a one-dimensional (1D) system where flow occurs only along the $x$-axis, the specific discharge vector is $\\mathbf{q} = q(x) \\mathbf{\\hat{i}}$, where $\\mathbf{\\hat{i}}$ is the unit vector in the $x$ direction. The continuity equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{dq}{dx} = 0\n$$\nThis equation implies that the specific discharge $q$ must be constant along the spatial coordinate $x$.\n\nThe second fundamental principle is Darcy's Law, which relates the specific discharge to the gradient of the hydraulic head $h$. For a homogeneous and isotropic porous medium with hydraulic conductivity $K$, Darcy's Law in 1D is:\n$$\nq = -K \\frac{dh}{dx}\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates that flow occurs in the direction of decreasing hydraulic head.\n\nTo derive the governing equation for the hydraulic head $h(x)$, we substitute Darcy's Law into the continuity equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dx} \\left( -K \\frac{dh}{dx} \\right) = 0\n$$\nSince the problem states the porous medium is homogeneous, the hydraulic conductivity $K$ is a constant. Therefore, it can be taken outside the derivative:\n$$\n-K \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{dh}{dx} \\right) = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d^2h}{dx^2} = 0\n$$\nThis is the governing second-order ordinary differential equation for the hydraulic head in this system. It is the 1D Laplace equation. To find the specific solution for $h(x)$, we integrate this equation twice with respect to $x$. The first integration yields:\n$$\n\\frac{dh}{dx} = C_1\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ is a constant of integration. This shows that the hydraulic gradient is constant. The second integration yields:\n$$\nh(x) = C_1 x + C_2\n$$\nwhere $C_2$ is a second constant of integration. This shows that the hydraulic head varies linearly with position.\n\nThe constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ are determined by applying the given boundary conditions.\nAt $x=0$, the hydraulic head is $h(0) = h_A$. Substituting this into the general solution:\n$$\nh(0) = C_1(0) + C_2 = h_A \\implies C_2 = h_A\n$$\nAt $x=L$, the hydraulic head is $h(L) = h_B$. Substituting this and the value of $C_2$ into the general solution:\n$$\nh(L) = C_1 L + h_A = h_B\n$$\nSolving for $C_1$:\n$$\nC_1 L = h_B - h_A \\implies C_1 = \\frac{h_B - h_A}{L}\n$$\nThus, the specific solution for the hydraulic head profile is:\n$$\nh(x) = \\left( \\frac{h_B - h_A}{L} \\right) x + h_A\n$$\nNow, we can compute the specific discharge $q$ using Darcy's Law and the derived expression for the hydraulic gradient $\\frac{dh}{dx}$:\n$$\nq = -K \\frac{dh}{dx} = -K C_1 = -K \\left( \\frac{h_B - h_A}{L} \\right)\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\nq = K \\frac{h_A - h_B}{L}\n$$\nThis expression confirms that $q$ is constant, as required by mass conservation. The sign of $q$ indicates the direction of flow. Since $h_A > h_B$, the term $h_A - h_B$ is positive, and thus $q$ is positive, indicating that flow is in the positive $x$ direction (from the reservoir at $x=0$ to the reservoir at $x=L$), which is physically consistent.\n\nWe are given the following numerical values:\n$K = 2.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$\n$L = 50\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n$h_A = 10.0\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n$h_B = 6.8\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $q$:\n$$\nq = (2.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}) \\frac{10.0\\ \\mathrm{m} - 6.8\\ \\mathrm{m}}{50\\ \\mathrm{m}}\n$$\n$$\nq = (2.5 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}) \\frac{3.2\\ \\mathrm{m}}{50\\ \\mathrm{m}}\n$$\n$$\nq = (2.5 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times 0.064\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}\n$$\n$$\nq = 1.6 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be in units of meters per day ($\\mathrm{m\\,day^{-1}}$).

Assume steady-state flow, homogeneous and isotropic properties, negligible leakage, and that the aquifer extends infinitely in the half-plane $x0$. The governing equations are based on Darcy’s law and conservation of mass.

            "solution": "The problem is to determine the hydraulic head at a specific point in a two-dimensional, confined, homogeneous, and isotropic aquifer under steady-state conditions. The aquifer is bounded by a river with a constant head and contains a single pumping well. This is a classic boundary value problem in hydrogeology, governed by the groundwater flow equation.\n\nFirst, we establish the governing mathematical framework. For steady-state flow in a homogeneous aquifer with no distributed sources or sinks, the principle of mass conservation combined with Darcy's Law leads to the Laplace equation for the hydraulic head $h(x,y)$:\n$$ \\nabla^2 h = \\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 h}{\\partial y^2} = 0 $$\nThis equation holds everywhere in the domain except at point singularities like wells. A pumping well abstracting water at a volumetric rate $Q$ is treated as a point sink. The governing equation for the entire domain, incorporating the well, is the Poisson equation:\n$$ \\nabla^2 h = -\\frac{Q}{T} \\delta(x-a)\\delta(y) $$\nwhere $T$ is the aquifer transmissivity, given by the product of hydraulic conductivity $K$ and aquifer thickness $b$, i.e., $T=Kb$. The term $\\delta(\\cdot)$ is the Dirac delta function, and the well is located at $(a,0)$.\n\nThe domain is the half-plane $x0$, with the following boundary conditions:\n1. A constant head boundary along the river: $h(0, y) = H_b$.\n2. The head approaches the river head far from the well: $h(x,y) \\to H_b$ as $\\sqrt{x^2+y^2} \\to \\infty$ within the domain $x  0$.\n\nTo solve this problem, it is convenient to define a new variable, the drawdown $s(x,y)$, relative to the constant boundary head $H_b$. However, we can also work with a shifted head function, $\\hat{h}(x,y) = h(x,y) - H_b$. The problem for $\\hat{h}$ becomes:\n$$ \\nabla^2 \\hat{h} = -\\frac{Q}{T} \\delta(x-a)\\delta(y) $$\nwith a homogeneous boundary condition at the river:\n$$ \\hat{h}(0, y) = h(0,y) - H_b = H_b - H_b = 0 $$\nAnd $\\hat{h}(x,y) \\to 0$ far from the well.\n\nThis transformed problem with a zero-head boundary is ideally suited for the method of images. We have a real sink (pumping well) at $(a,0)$. To enforce the condition $\\hat{h}(0,y)=0$, we introduce an \"image\" well. For a constant-head boundary, the image well is of the opposite type and is placed at the mirror-image location across the boundary. The real well is a sink of strength $-Q$, so we must place an image source of strength $+Q$ at $(-a,0)$.\n\nThe solution for $\\hat{h}$ is then the superposition of the effects of the real sink and the image source. The contribution to the head from a well of volumetric source/sink strength $W_0$ at a distance $r$ is given by $h_{well} = -\\frac{W_0}{2\\pi T}\\ln(r)$.\n- The real well is a sink, so its strength is $W_{real} = -Q$. Its contribution to the head is $\\hat{h}_{real} = -\\frac{(-Q)}{2\\pi T} \\ln(r_{real}) = \\frac{Q}{2\\pi T} \\ln(r_{real})$, where $r_{real} = \\sqrt{(x-a)^2 + y^2}$.\n- The image well is a source, so its strength is $W_{image} = +Q$. Its contribution to the head is $\\hat{h}_{image} = -\\frac{(+Q)}{2\\pi T} \\ln(r_{image}) = -\\frac{Q}{2\\pi T} \\ln(r_{image})$, where $r_{image} = \\sqrt{(x+a)^2 + y^2}$.\n\nThe total shifted head $\\hat{h}$ is the sum of these two contributions:\n$$ \\hat{h}(x,y) = \\hat{h}_{real} + \\hat{h}_{image} = \\frac{Q}{2\\pi T} \\ln(r_{real}) - \\frac{Q}{2\\pi T} \\ln(r_{image}) = \\frac{Q}{2\\pi T} \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_{real}}{r_{image}}\\right) $$\nBy construction, at the boundary $x=0$, we have $r_{real} = \\sqrt{(-a)^2+y^2} = \\sqrt{(a)^2+y^2} = r_{image}$, so $\\ln(r_{real}/r_{image}) = \\ln(1) = 0$, and $\\hat{h}(0,y)=0$ is satisfied.\n\nFinally, we transform back to the original hydraulic head $h(x,y)$:\n$$ h(x,y) = \\hat{h}(x,y) + H_b = H_b + \\frac{Q}{2\\pi T} \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_{real}}{r_{image}}\\right) $$\nThis can also be written as $h(x,y) = H_b - \\frac{Q}{2\\pi T} \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_{image}}{r_{real}}\\right)$. This form clearly shows that for any point in the domain ($x0$), $r_{image}  r_{real}$, so the logarithmic term is positive, and the head $h$ is less than the boundary head $H_b$, which is physically correct due to the pumping well.\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values to find the head at the point $P=(x_p, y_p)=(70, 40)\\ \\mathrm{m}$:\n- Hydraulic conductivity, $K = 2.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m/s}$\n- Aquifer thickness, $b = 100\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- Pumping rate, $Q = 1.5 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m^3/s}$\n- Well x-coordinate, $a = 100\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- Boundary head, $H_b = 50\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n- Point coordinates, $x_p = 70\\ \\mathrm{m}$, $y_p = 40\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the aquifer transmissivity $T$:\n$$ T = K \\cdot b = (2.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{m/s}) \\times (100\\ \\mathrm{m}) = 2.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m^2/s} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the distances from the point $P$ to the real and image wells:\n$$ r_{real} = \\sqrt{(x_p - a)^2 + y_p^2} = \\sqrt{(70 - 100)^2 + 40^2} = \\sqrt{(-30)^2 + 40^2} = \\sqrt{900 + 1600} = \\sqrt{2500} = 50\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\n$$ r_{image} = \\sqrt{(x_p + a)^2 + y_p^2} = \\sqrt{(70 + 100)^2 + 40^2} = \\sqrt{170^2 + 40^2} = \\sqrt{28900 + 1600} = \\sqrt{30500}\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\n\nNow, we can compute the head $h(x_p, y_p)$:\n$$ h(70, 40) = H_b + \\frac{Q}{2\\pi T} \\ln\\left(\\frac{r_{real}}{r_{image}}\\right) $$\n$$ h(70, 40) = 50 + \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{-2}}{2\\pi (2.0 \\times 10^{-3})} \\ln\\left(\\frac{50}{\\sqrt{30500}}\\right) $$\n$$ h(70, 40) = 50 + \\frac{1.5 \\times 10^{-2}}{4\\pi \\times 10^{-3}} \\ln\\left(\\frac{50}{\\sqrt{30500}}\\right) $$\n$$ h(70, 40) = 50 + \\frac{15}{4\\pi} \\ln\\left(\\frac{50}{\\sqrt{30500}}\\right) $$\nNumerically evaluating the expression:\n$$ h(70, 40) \\approx 50 + 1.19366 \\times \\ln\\left(\\frac{50}{174.6425}\\right) $$\n$$ h(70, 40) \\approx 50 + 1.19366 \\times \\ln(0.28628) $$\n$$ h(70, 40) \\approx 50 + 1.19366 \\times (-1.25072) $$\n$$ h(70, 40) \\approx 50 - 1.49293 $$\n$$ h(70, 40) \\approx 48.50707\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get $48.51\\ \\mathrm{m}$.",
