The physics of heat conduction (Fourier's law) and latent heat consumption are fundamental principles. The application to permafrost thaw is a standard topic in geophysics and environmental science. All assumptions, while simplifications, are common in introductory treatments of the subject to achieve an analytical solution. The provided numerical values are physically realistic for thawing, ice-rich soil.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. The assumptions, particularly that of negligible sensible heat storage, lead to a straightforward ordinary differential equation that can be solved to find a unique solution for the active layer thickness. All necessary data for both the derivation and the final calculation are provided.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language. Terms like \"active layer thickness\" and \"thawing degree-days\" are either standard in the field or explicitly defined.\n4.  **No Other Flaws**: The problem is self-contained, consistent, and does not suffer from any of the other invalidity criteria. The setup is a valid and common idealization used in permafrost modeling.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the ALT Expression\nThe core of the problem lies in the energy balance at the moving thaw front, located at depth $z(t)$. The downward heat flux from the surface, $q(t)$, conducted through the thawed layer must equal the rate at which energy is consumed by melting ice as the front advances.\n\nThe energy required to melt the ice in a thin layer of soil of thickness $dz$ and unit area is determined by the volumetric latent heat of fusion of the soil, $L_v$. This is the energy needed to melt the ice contained within a unit volume of soil. Given the volumetric ice fraction $\\theta_i$, the mass of ice per unit volume of soil is $\\rho_i \\theta_i$. Therefore, the volumetric latent heat is:\n$$L_v = \\rho_i L \\theta_i$$\nThe rate of energy consumption per unit area as the front advances at a speed $dz/dt$ is $L_v \\frac{dz}{dt}$.\n\nAccording to Fourier's law of heat conduction, the heat flux at the thaw front is given by:\n$$q(t) = -k \\left. \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z'} \\right|_{z'=z(t)}$$\nwhere $z'$ is the depth coordinate, $T$ is the temperature, and $k$ is the thermal conductivity of the thawed layer.\n\nThe energy balance equation at the moving boundary $z(t)$ is thus:\n$$-k \\left. \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z'} \\right|_{z'=z(t)} = L_v \\frac{dz}{dt} = \\rho_i L \\theta_i \\frac{dz}{dt}$$\n\nThe problem states to neglect sensible heat storage in the thawed layer. This key simplification implies a quasi-steady-state temperature profile in the thawed zone ($0 \\le z' \\le z(t)$) at any instant $t$. This means the temperature profile is linear. The boundary conditions for the temperature in the thawed layer are:\n1. $T(z'=0, t) = T_s(t)$ (at the surface)\n2. $T(z'=z(t), t) = T_m = 0^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$ (at the thaw front)\n\nFor a linear profile, $T(z', t) = A(t) z' + B(t)$. Applying the boundary conditions:\n- $B(t) = T_s(t)$\n- $A(t) z(t) + T_s(t) = 0 \\implies A(t) = -\\frac{T_s(t)}{z(t)}$\n\nThe temperature profile is $T(z', t) = T_s(t) \\left(1 - \\frac{z'}{z(t)}\\right)$. The temperature gradient is constant throughout the thawed layer at any time $t$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z'} = -\\frac{T_s(t)}{z(t)}$$\nSubstituting this gradient into the energy balance equation:\n$$-k \\left( -\\frac{T_s(t)}{z(t)} \\right) = \\rho_i L \\theta_i \\frac{dz}{dt}$$\n$$\\frac{k T_s(t)}{z(t)} = \\rho_i L \\theta_i \\frac{dz}{dt}$$\nThis is a separable ordinary differential equation. We rearrange the terms to separate the variables $z$ and $t$. Thawing occurs only when $T_s(t) > 0$. We can thus replace $T_s(t)$ with $\\max(0, T_s(t))$.\n$$z(t) \\, dz = \\frac{k}{\\rho_i L \\theta_i} \\max(0, T_s(t)) \\, dt$$\nWe integrate this equation over the entire thaw season, from $t=0$ to $t=t_f$. The thaw depth evolves from $z(0)=0$ to $z(t_f) = z_{\\mathrm{ALT}}$.\n$$\\int_{0}^{z_{\\mathrm{ALT}}} z \\, dz = \\int_{0}^{t_f} \\frac{k}{\\rho_i L \\theta_i} \\max(0, T_s(t)) \\, dt$$\n$$\\left[ \\frac{z^2}{2} \\right]_{0}^{z_{\\mathrm{ALT}}} = \\frac{k}{\\rho_i L \\theta_i} \\int_{0}^{t_f} \\max(0, T_s(t)) \\, dt$$\n$$\\frac{z_{\\mathrm{ALT}}^2}{2} = \\frac{k}{\\rho_i L \\theta_i} \\int_{0}^{t_f} \\max(0, T_s(t)) \\, dt$$\nSolving for $z_{\\mathrm{ALT}}$, we obtain the general expression:\n$$z_{\\mathrm{ALT}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2k}{\\rho_i L \\theta_i} \\int_{0}^{t_f} \\max(0, T_s(t)) \\, dt}$$\n\n### Casting into a Practical Estimator using TDD\nThe problem defines the thawing degree-days, $F_{\\mathrm{TDD}}$, as the time integral of the positive part of the surface temperature, with units of $\\mathrm{K \\cdot day}$.\n$$F_{\\mathrm{TDD}} = \\int_{0}^{t_f} \\max(0, T_s(t)) \\, dt \\quad [\\text{in units of } \\mathrm{K \\cdot day}]$$\nThe integral in our derived expression, let's call it $I_{\\mathrm{SI}}$, must be in SI units of $\\mathrm{K \\cdot s}$ for dimensional consistency.\n$$I_{\\mathrm{SI}} = \\int_{0}^{t_f} \\max(0, T_s(t)) \\, dt \\quad [\\text{in units of } \\mathrm{K \\cdot s}]$$\nTo use the given $F_{\\mathrm{TDD}}$, we must convert it from $\\mathrm{K \\cdot day}$ to $\\mathrm{K \\cdot s}$. The conversion factor is the number of seconds in a day:\n$$1 \\ \\mathrm{day} = 24 \\ \\mathrm{h/day} \\times 60 \\ \\mathrm{min/h} \\times 60 \\ \\mathrm{s/min} = 86400 \\ \\mathrm{s}$$\nThus, the relationship is:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{SI}} = F_{\\mathrm{TDD}} \\times 86400 \\ \\mathrm{s/day}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $z_{\\mathrm{ALT}}$ gives the practical estimator:\n$$z_{\\mathrm{ALT}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2k F_{\\mathrm{TDD}} \\times 86400}{\\rho_i L \\theta_i}}$$\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nWe now compute $z_{\\mathrm{ALT}}$ using the provided numerical values:\n- $k = 1.2 \\ \\mathrm{W \\ m^{-1} \\ K^{-1}}$\n- $\\rho_{i} = 917 \\ \\mathrm{kg \\ m^{-3}}$\n- $L = 3.34 \\times 10^{5} \\ \\mathrm{J \\ kg^{-1}}$\n- $\\theta_{i} = 0.50$\n- $F_{\\mathrm{TDD}} = 650 \\ \\mathrm{K \\cdot day}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the volumetric latent heat of fusion for the soil, $L_v$:\n$$L_v = \\rho_i L \\theta_i = (917 \\ \\mathrm{kg \\ m^{-3}}) \\times (3.34 \\times 10^{5} \\ \\mathrm{J \\ kg^{-1}}) \\times 0.50$$\n$$L_v = 1.531295 \\times 10^{8} \\ \\mathrm{J \\ m^{-3}}$$\n\nNext, we convert thawing degree-days to SI units:\n$$I_{\\mathrm{SI}} = F_{\\mathrm{TDD}} \\times 86400 = 650 \\ \\mathrm{K \\cdot day} \\times 86400 \\ \\mathrm{s/day} = 5.616 \\times 10^{7} \\ \\mathrm{K \\cdot s}$$\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the estimator for $z_{\\mathrm{ALT}}$:\n$$z_{\\mathrm{ALT}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times (1.2 \\ \\mathrm{W \\ m^{-1} \\ K^{-1}}) \\times (5.616 \\times 10^{7} \\ \\mathrm{K \\cdot s})}{1.531295 \\times 10^{8} \\ \\mathrm{J \\ m^{-3}}}}$$\nNoting that $1 \\ \\mathrm{W} = 1 \\ \\mathrm{J \\ s^{-1}}$, the numerator simplifies to:\n$$2 \\times 1.2 \\times 5.616 \\times 10^{7} \\ \\mathrm{J \\ m^{-1}} = 1.34784 \\times 10^{8} \\ \\mathrm{J \\ m^{-1}}$$\nSo,\n$$z_{\\mathrm{ALT}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1.34784 \\times 10^{8} \\ \\mathrm{J \\ m^{-1}}}{1.531295 \\times 10^{8} \\ \\mathrm{J \\ m^{-3}}}}$$\n$$z_{\\mathrm{ALT}} = \\sqrt{0.880199... \\ \\mathrm{m^2}}$$\n$$z_{\\mathrm{ALT}} = 0.938189... \\ \\mathrm{m}$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, as requested:\n$$z_{\\mathrm{ALT}} \\approx 0.938 \\ \\mathrm{m}$$",

The physical model is based on established principles of fluid flow in porous media (Darcy's law and mass conservation) combined with a plausible constitutive model for the effect of ice on hydraulic conductivity.

            "solution": "The governing description for thaw consolidation in a saturated, one-dimensional soil layer is obtained from conservation of mass of pore water combined with Darcy's law. For small strains and constant properties, the excess pore-water pressure $u(z,t)$ evolves according to\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = c_v \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial z^2},\n$$\nwhere $c_v$ is the coefficient of consolidation defined by $c_v = \\frac{k}{\\gamma_w m_v}$. This partial differential equation is a classical diffusion equation with boundary conditions determined by drainage. We consider two physically relevant boundary configurations:\n- Double drainage: $u(0,t) = 0$ and $u(H,t) = 0$, corresponding to drained top and bottom surfaces.\n- Single drainage: $u(0,t) = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z}\\big|_{z=H} = 0$, corresponding to a drained top and impermeable bottom.\n\nThe initial condition at $t=0$ is a uniform excess pore pressure $u(z,0) = u_0$, representing instantaneous application of load or thaw-induced stress redistribution. Under linear consolidation theory, settlement is proportional to the average degree of consolidation, so the time-dependent settlement $s(t)$ can be written as\n$$\ns(t) = U(t)\\, S_f,\n$$\nwhere $S_f$ is the final settlement under the applied load,\n$$\nS_f = H\\, m_v \\, \\Delta \\sigma',\n$$\nand $U(t)$ is the average degree of consolidation. The dimensionless time is\n$$\nT_v = \\frac{c_v t}{H_d^2},\n$$\nwhere $H_d$ is the maximum drainage path length, equal to $H/2$ for double drainage and $H$ for single drainage. The task reduces to obtaining $U(t)$ from the solution of the diffusion equation subject to the specified boundary conditions.\n\nTo derive $U(t)$, we use separation of variables and eigenfunction expansions. For both boundary configurations with uniform initial excess pore pressure, the solution for $u(z,t)$ can be expanded in orthogonal modes whose temporal decay rates are determined by eigenvalues. The spatially averaged excess pore pressure $\\bar{u}(t)$ is obtained by integrating $u(z,t)$ over $z \\in [0,H]$ and dividing by $H$. The average degree of consolidation is then\n$$\nU(t) = 1 - \\frac{\\bar{u}(t)}{\\bar{u}(0)}.\n$$\nCarrying out the eigenfunction expansion for the respective boundary conditions yields a series for $\\bar{u}(t)$ with odd-mode contributions. In both single and double drainage cases, when expressed in terms of the maximum drainage path length $H_d$, the average degree of consolidation for a uniform initial excess pore pressure has the same functional form in terms of $T_v$:\n$$\nU(T_v) = 1 - \\frac{8}{\\pi^2} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(2n+1)^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(2n+1)^2 \\pi^2}{4} T_v\\right).\n$$\nThis result follows from selecting eigenfunctions consistent with the boundary conditions (sine functions for double drainage, a combination yielding odd modes for single drainage) and computing the Fourier coefficients of the uniform initial condition. The factor $\\frac{1}{4}$ in the exponential emerges from the eigenvalues associated with odd modes and the definition of $T_v$ using $H_d$.\n\nThe settlement $s(t)$ is then computed as\n$$\ns(t) = U(T_v) \\, S_f = \\left[1 - \\frac{8}{\\pi^2} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(2n+1)^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(2n+1)^2 \\pi^2}{4} \\frac{c_v t}{H_d^2}\\right)\\right] \\, H\\, m_v \\, \\Delta \\sigma'.\n$$\nAlgorithmic design:\n- Convert each provided time in days to seconds using $1\\,\\mathrm{day} = 86400\\,\\mathrm{s}$ to maintain unit consistency for $c_v$ in $\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$.\n- Compute $S_f = H\\, m_v \\, \\Delta \\sigma'$ in meters.\n- Determine $H_d$ as $H/2$ for double drainage and $H$ for single drainage.\n- For each time $t$, compute $T_v = c_v t / H_d^2$.\n- Evaluate $U(T_v)$ using the series truncated adaptively: sum over odd terms until the incremental term $\\frac{1}{(2n+1)^2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(2n+1)^2 \\pi^2}{4} T_v\\right)$ is smaller than a tolerance (for example $10^{-12}$), or until a safe maximum number of terms (for example $200$) is reached.\n- Handle the boundary case $t=0$ by setting $U(0) = 0$ exactly, which yields $s(0) = 0$.\n- Compute $s(t) = U(T_v) \\, S_f$.\n- Round each settlement to six decimal places and output the aggregated list in the specified order: Case $1$ times, followed by Case $2$ times, followed by Case $3$ times.\n\nScientific realism considerations:\n- The chosen parameter ranges are representative of saturated soils in cold regions: $c_v$ values of order $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}^2/\\mathrm{s}$, $m_v$ values of order $10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}^{-1}$, and realistic layer thicknesses.\n- The boundary conditions reflect physically plausible drainage scenarios in permafrost terrains (single drainage into the active layer versus double drainage where both interfaces permit flow).\n- The settlement magnitudes are in the centimeter-scale for the supplied parameters, consistent with thaw consolidation observations.\n\nThe program implements this algorithm and prints the settlements in meters for all specified times in the required single-line format.",
