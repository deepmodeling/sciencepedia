            "solution": "The problem requires a three-part response: first, the derivation of the bulk aerodynamic formula for sensible heat flux $H$; second, a numerical calculation of $H$ using provided data; and third, a qualitative discussion of the factors influencing aerodynamic resistance $r_a$.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Bulk Aerodynamic Expression for Sensible Heat Flux**\n\nWe begin with the Reynolds-averaged conservation equation for a scalar quantity, in this case, potential temperature $\\theta$, within the atmospheric surface layer. Under the specified conditions of a stationary state ($\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = 0$) and horizontal homogeneity (negligible advection and other horizontal gradient terms), the equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\overline{w' \\theta'}}{\\partial z} = 0\n$$\nwhere $\\overline{w' \\theta'}$ is the vertical kinematic turbulent flux of potential temperature, $w'$ is the turbulent fluctuation in vertical velocity, $\\theta'$ is the fluctuation in potential temperature, and the overbar denotes a time average. This equation implies that the turbulent flux $\\overline{w' \\theta'}$ is constant with height $z$ in the surface layer.\n\nThe sensible heat flux $H$ (in units of W m$^{-2}$ or J s$^{-1}$ m$^{-2}$) is defined as the turbulent flux at the surface multiplied by the volumetric heat capacity of air, $\\rho c_p$:\n$$\nH = \\rho c_p (\\overline{w' \\theta'})_s\n$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the air density and $c_p$ is the specific heat capacity at constant pressure. Given that the flux is constant with height, we can write for any height $z$ in the surface layer:\n$$\nH = \\rho c_p \\overline{w' \\theta'}\n$$\nThe problem statement uses absolute temperature $T$. For the shallow depths of the surface layer, the difference between the gradient of potential temperature and absolute temperature is negligible, so we can approximate $\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial z} \\approx \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z}$ and $\\Delta \\theta \\approx \\Delta T$. We will proceed using $T$ to align with the problem statement.\n$$\nH = \\rho c_p \\overline{w' T'}\n$$\nNext, we invoke the first-order closure hypothesis, also known as $K$-theory or eddy-diffusivity theory. This postulation relates the turbulent flux to the gradient of the mean quantity:\n$$\n\\overline{w' T'} = -K_h \\frac{\\partial \\bar{T}}{\\partial z}\n$$\nHere, $K_h$ is the eddy diffusivity for heat, and $\\bar{T}$ is the mean air temperature. The negative sign ensures that a positive (upward) flux occurs when temperature decreases with height (a negative gradient), which is the standard convention. Combining the expressions for $H$ and $\\overline{w' T'}$ gives the flux-gradient relationship:\n$$\nH = - \\rho c_p K_h \\frac{\\partial \\bar{T}}{\\partial z}\n$$\nMonin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST) provides a framework for describing the structure of turbulence in the surface layer. According to MOST, $K_h$ can be expressed in terms of the friction velocity $u_*$, the von Kármán constant $k$ (approximately $0.4$), height $z$, and a dimensionless stability function $\\phi_h(\\zeta)$:\n$$\nK_h = \\frac{k u_* z}{\\phi_h(\\zeta)}\n$$\nwhere $\\zeta = z/L$ is the dimensionless stability parameter, with $L$ being the Obukhov length. The function $\\phi_h(\\zeta)$ accounts for the enhancement or suppression of turbulence by buoyancy.\n\nSubstituting the MOST expression for $K_h$ into the flux-gradient relationship:\n$$\nH = - \\rho c_p \\left( \\frac{k u_* z}{\\phi_h(z/L)} \\right) \\frac{\\partial \\bar{T}}{\\partial z}\n$$\nTo obtain a bulk formula relating the flux to the temperature difference between the surface and the air at a reference height $z_a$, we rearrange and integrate this differential equation with respect to $z$. We integrate from the conceptual surface, defined at the roughness length for heat $z_{0h}$, where the temperature is the surface temperature $T_s$, up to the measurement height $z_a$, where the temperature is $T_a$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\bar{T}}{\\partial z} = -\\frac{H}{\\rho c_p k u_*} \\frac{\\phi_h(z/L)}{z}\n$$\n$$\n\\int_{T(z_{0h})}^{T(z_a)} d\\bar{T} = \\int_{T_s}^{T_a} d\\bar{T} = -\\frac{H}{\\rho c_p k u_*} \\int_{z_{0h}}^{z_a} \\frac{\\phi_h(z/L)}{z} dz\n$$\nPerforming the integration on the temperature gives:\n$$\nT_a - T_s = -\\frac{H}{\\rho c_p} \\left( \\frac{1}{k u_*} \\int_{z_{0h}}^{z_a} \\frac{\\phi_h(z/L)}{z} dz \\right)\n$$\nWe solve for $H$ and adopt the sign convention that an upward flux ($T_s  T_a$) is positive:\n$$\nH = \\frac{\\rho c_p (T_s - T_a)}{\\frac{1}{k u_*} \\int_{z_{0h}}^{z_a} \\frac{\\phi_h(z/L)}{z} dz}\n$$\nThis is the bulk aerodynamic expression for the sensible heat flux. The denominator is identified as the aerodynamic resistance to heat transfer, $r_a$:\n$$\nr_a \\equiv \\frac{1}{k u_*} \\int_{z_{0h}}^{z_a} \\frac{\\phi_h(z/L)}{z} dz\n$$\nThe integral term is often written in terms of a stability correction function, $\\Psi_h(\\zeta) = \\int_{0}^{\\zeta} \\frac{1-\\phi_h(\\zeta')}{\\zeta'}d\\zeta'$, leading to the expression $r_a = \\frac{1}{k u_*} \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{z_a}{z_{0h}}\\right) - \\Psi_h\\left(\\frac{z_a}{L}\\right) \\right]$, assuming the term $\\Psi_h(z_{0h}/L)$ is negligible.\n\nThus, we arrive at the final bulk form as requested:\n$$\nH = \\rho c_p \\frac{T_s - T_a}{r_a}\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Evaluation of H**\n\nWe are given the following quantities:\n-   Temperature difference, $T_s - T_a = 3$ K\n-   Volumetric heat capacity of air, $\\rho c_p = 1200$ J m$^{-3}$ K$^{-1}$\n-   Aerodynamic resistance, $r_a = 30$ s m$^{-1}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived bulk formula:\n$$\nH = (1200 \\, \\text{J m}^{-3} \\text{ K}^{-1}) \\frac{3 \\, \\text{K}}{30 \\, \\text{s m}^{-1}}\n$$\n$$\nH = \\frac{3600}{30} \\, \\frac{\\text{J} \\cdot \\text{m}}{\\text{m}^3 \\cdot \\text{s}} = 120 \\, \\text{J s}^{-1} \\text{m}^{-2}\n$$\nSince $1$ W $= 1$ J s$^{-1}$, the sensible heat flux is $H = 120$ W m$^{-2}$. The problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures. The value $120$ can be written as $1.20 \\times 10^2$ to unambiguously show three significant figures.\n\n**Part 3: Qualitative Dependence of Aerodynamic Resistance**\n\nThe aerodynamic resistance $r_a$ is given by the expression derived from MOST:\n$$\nr_a = \\frac{1}{k u_*} \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\frac{z_a}{z_{0h}}\\right) - \\Psi_h\\left(\\frac{z_a}{L}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nIts dependence on wind speed and atmospheric stability can be analyzed as follows:\n\n1.  **Dependence on Wind Speed**: Wind speed is not explicitly in the formula, but the friction velocity $u_*$ is directly related to it. For a given surface roughness, $u_*$ increases with increasing wind speed. Since $r_a$ is inversely proportional to $u_*$ ($r_a \\propto 1/u_*$), an increase in wind speed leads to an increase in $u_*$ and consequently a **decrease** in $r_a$. Physically, stronger winds cause more vigorous turbulent mixing, which enhances the efficiency of heat transport and thus lowers the resistance to it.\n\n2.  **Dependence on Atmospheric Stability**: This is governed by the stability parameter $\\zeta = z/L$ and the integrated stability correction function $\\Psi_h$. We consider three regimes:\n    -   **Neutral Conditions ($L \\to \\pm\\infty, \\zeta = 0$)**: In this case, buoyancy forces are negligible. The stability function $\\phi_h(0) = 1$, and its integrated form $\\Psi_h(0) = 0$. The resistance reduces to its neutral value: $r_{a,n} = \\frac{1}{k u_*} \\ln\\left(\\frac{z_a}{z_{0h}}\\right)$. This serves as a baseline.\n    -   **Unstable Conditions ($L  0, \\zeta  0$)**: This occurs when the surface is warmer than the overlying air ($H  0$), generating buoyant eddies that enhance vertical mixing. For unstable conditions, $\\phi_h(\\zeta)  1$, which results in $\\Psi_h(\\zeta)  0$. The term $-\\Psi_h(z_a/L)$ is therefore negative. This makes the overall bracketed term smaller than its neutral counterpart. Consequently, for the same wind speed, $r_a$ is **smaller** under unstable conditions than under neutral conditions. The enhanced turbulent motion due to buoyancy reduces the resistance to heat transfer.\n    -   **Stable Conditions ($L  0, \\zeta  0$)**: This occurs when the surface is cooler than the air ($H  0$), leading to negative buoyancy that suppresses vertical motion and turbulence. For stable conditions, $\\phi_h(\\zeta)  1$, which results in $\\Psi_h(\\zeta)  0$. The term $-\\Psi_h(z_a/L)$ is therefore positive. This makes the overall bracketed term larger than its neutral counterpart. Consequently, for the same wind speed, $r_a$ is **larger** under stable conditions than under neutral conditions. The damping of turbulence by stratification increases the resistance to heat transfer.\n\nIn summary, $r_a$ decreases with increasing wind speed and is lowest in unstable conditions, moderate in neutral conditions, and highest in stable conditions.",

Substituting this into the heat equation gives an ordinary differential equation for $f(z)$:\n$$\ni\\omega f(z) = D \\frac{d^2 f}{dz^2} \\implies \\frac{d^2 f}{dz^2} = \\frac{i\\omega}{D} f(z)\n$$\nThe general solution is $f(z) = A \\exp(\\lambda z) + B \\exp(-\\lambda z)$, where $\\lambda^2 = i\\omega/D$.\nWe compute $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{i\\omega}{D}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{D}} \\sqrt{i} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{D}} \\exp(i\\pi/4) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{D}} \\left(\\cos\\frac{\\pi}{4} + i\\sin\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2D}}(1+i)\n$$\nThe solution for the complex temperature is $\\tilde{T}(z,t) = \\left[A \\exp(\\lambda z) + B \\exp(-\\lambda z)\\right] \\exp(i\\omega t)$. The boundary condition that temperature remains bounded as $z \\to \\infty$ requires the coefficient of the exponentially growing term, $A$, to be zero. Thus, $\\tilde{T}(z,t) = B \\exp(-\\lambda z) \\exp(i\\omega t)$.\nAt the surface $z=0$, we have $\\tilde{T}(0,t) = B \\exp(i\\omega t)$. Comparing with the boundary condition $\\tilde{T}(0,t) = T_a \\exp(i\\omega t)$, we find $B=T_a$. The complex temperature profile is:\n$$\n\\tilde{T}(z,t) = T_a \\exp(-\\lambda z) \\exp(i\\omega t) = T_a \\exp\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2D}}(1+i)z\\right) \\exp(i\\omega t)\n$$\nThe actual temperature is the real part, $T(z,t) = T_0 + \\text{Re}[\\tilde{T}(z,t)]$:\n$$\nT(z,t) = T_0 + T_a \\exp\\left(-\\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2D}}z\\right) \\cos\\left(\\omega t - \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2D}}z\\right)\n$$\nThe soil heat flux is given by Fourier's law, $G(z,t) = -k \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial z}$. Let's compute the gradient from the complex form, $\\frac{\\partial \\tilde{T}}{\\partial z} = - \\lambda T_a \\exp(-\\lambda z) \\exp(i\\omega t) = -\\lambda \\tilde{T}(z,t)$.\nThe complex heat flux is $\\tilde{G}(z,t) = -k \\frac{\\partial \\tilde{T}}{\\partial z} = k \\lambda \\tilde{T}(z,t)$.\nAt the surface ($z=0$):\n$$\n\\tilde{G}(0,t) = k\\lambda \\tilde{T}(0,t) = k \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2D}}(1+i) T_a \\exp(i\\omega t)\n$$\nThe amplitude of the surface heat flux, $G_a$, is the modulus of the complex amplitude $k \\lambda T_a$:\n$$\nG_a = \\left| k T_a \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2D}}(1+i) \\right| = k T_a \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2D}} |1+i| = k T_a \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2D}} \\sqrt{1^2+1^2} = k T_a \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{2D}} \\sqrt{2}\n$$\n$$\nG_a = k T_a \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega}{D}}\n$$\nThis can also be expressed in terms of the thermal admittance, $\\sqrt{kC}$, as $G_a = T_a \\sqrt{kC\\omega}$, since $D=k/C$. This completes the first part of the task.\n\n**2. Calculation of Post-Rainfall Properties and Flux Amplitude**\n\nWe need to compute the flux amplitude $G_a$ for the post-rain condition $\\theta_2 = 0.35$. This involves calculating the thermal properties $C(\\theta_2)$ and $k(\\theta_2)$.\n\n**a.

Volumetric Heat Capacity $C(\\theta_2)$**\nUsing the given formula $C(\\theta) = (1 - n)\\rho_m c_m + \\theta \\rho_w c_w$ with $\\theta_2 = 0.35$:\n$$\nC(\\theta_2) = (1 - 0.45)(2650 \\text{ kg m}^{-3})(800 \\text{ J kg}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1}) + (0.35)(1000 \\text{ kg m}^{-3})(4186 \\text{ J kg}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1})\n$$\n$$\nC(\\theta_2) = (0.55)(2120000) + (0.35)(4186000) \\text{ J m}^{-3} \\text{ K}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nC(\\theta_2) = 1166000 + 1465100 = 2631100 \\text{ J m}^{-3} \\text{ K}^{-1}\n$$\n\n**c. Thermal Conductivity $k(\\theta_2)$**\nFirst, we find the degree of saturation $S_2 = \\theta_2 / n$:\n$$\nS_2 = \\frac{0.35}{0.45} = \\frac{7}{9}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the Kersten number $K_{e,2} = \\log_{10}(S_2) + 1$:\n$$\nK_{e,2} = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{7}{9}\\right) + 1 \\approx -0.10914856 + 1 = 0.89085144\n$$\nNow, we use the Johansen model $k(\\theta) = k_{\\text{dry}} + K_{e} (k_{\\text{sat}} - k_{\\text{dry}})$:\n$$\nk(\\theta_2) = 0.25 \\text{ W m}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1} + (0.89085144) (2.5 - 0.25) \\text{ W m}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nk(\\theta_2) = 0.25 + (0.89085144)(2.25) \\approx 0.25 + 2.00441574 = 2.25441574 \\text{ W m}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1}\n$$\nThe increase in water content significantly raises both heat capacity C and thermal conductivity k. This leads to a higher thermal diffusivity $D=k/C \\approx 8.568 \\times 10^{-7} \\text{ m}^2\\text{s}^{-1}$ and, crucially, a larger thermal admittance $\\sqrt{kC}$.\n\n**d. Amplitude of Surface Soil Heat Flux $G_a$**\nWe now substitute the calculated values into the derived formula $G_a = T_a \\sqrt{k(\\theta_2) C(\\theta_2) \\omega}$:\n$$\nG_a = (10 \\text{ K}) \\sqrt{(2.25441574 \\text{ W m}^{-1} \\text{ K}^{-1}) (2631100 \\text{ J m}^{-3} \\text{ K}^{-1}) \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{86400} \\text{ s}^{-1}\\right)}\n$$\nThe term inside the square root is the product of thermal admittance squared and angular frequency:\n$$\nk C \\omega \\approx (2.25441574)(2631100)\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{86400}\\right) \\approx 5931320.15 \\times 7.2722 \\times 10^{-5} \\approx 431.309 \\text{ W}^2 \\text{m}^{-4} \\text{K}^{-2}\n$$\nTaking the square root and multiplying by $T_a$:\n$$\nG_a \\approx 10 \\times \\sqrt{431.309} \\approx 10 \\times 20.7680 \\text{ W m}^{-2} \\approx 207.68 \\text{ W m}^{-2}\n$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures as requested:\n$$\nG_a \\approx 208 \\text{ W m}^{-2}\n$$",
