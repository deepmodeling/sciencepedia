            "problem": "A simplified but representative stiff process in environmental and earth system modeling is the first-order decay of a highly reactive dissolved species in a well-mixed control volume. Let the concentration be modeled by the ordinary differential equation $y'(t) = -1000\\,y(t)$ with an initial condition $y(0) = y_{0}$, where the large decay coefficient models a fast chemical sink relative to advective or diffusive transport. Consider two widely used time-stepping methods for initial value problems: the Forward Euler method and the Backward Euler method. Using only the definitions of these methods as one-step discretizations of $y'(t)$, derive the linear one-step update for each method when applied to this equation, and thereby obtain the one-step amplification factor $g(\\Delta t)$ such that $y_{n+1} = g(\\Delta t)\\,y_{n}$ for each method. Evaluate the magnitude of the amplification factor, $|g(\\Delta t)|$, for each method at the two time steps $\\Delta t = 0.001$ and $\\Delta t = 1$. Interpret the implications of these values for stiffness-related error dynamics and stability, discussing how each method behaves for these step sizes in the context of fast decay typical of stiff environmental subsystems.

It poses a standard question from the field of numerical analysis for differential equations, specifically using Dahlquist's test equation, $y'(t) = \\lambda y(t)$ with $\\lambda = -1000$, to analyze the stability of basic numerical integrators. This is a canonical problem for illustrating the concept of stiffness in ODEs. The context provided, a fast chemical sink in an environmental model, is a realistic and appropriate application. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary information provided to derive a unique, meaningful solution. The terminology is precise and objective. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe given ordinary differential equation is a linear, first-order, homogeneous equation with a constant coefficient:\n$$y'(t) = -1000\\,y(t)$$\nLet $y_n$ be the numerical approximation of the solution $y(t_n)$ at time $t_n = n \\Delta t$, where $\\Delta t$ is the time step. The general form of the ODE is $y'(t) = f(t, y(t))$, where for this problem, $f(t, y) = -1000 y$.\n\n**1. Forward Euler Method**\n\nThe Forward Euler (FE) method is an explicit one-step method defined by the recurrence relation:\n$$y_{n+1} = y_n + \\Delta t\\,f(t_n, y_n)$$\nSubstituting the given function $f(t_n, y_n) = -1000\\,y_n$ into the FE formula yields:\n$$y_{n+1} = y_n + \\Delta t (-1000\\,y_n)$$\nFactoring out $y_n$ gives the one-step update rule:\n$$y_{n+1} = (1 - 1000\\,\\Delta t)\\,y_n$$\nBy comparing this to the form $y_{n+1} = g(\\Delta t)\\,y_n$, we identify the amplification factor for the Forward Euler method, $g_{\\text{FE}}(\\Delta t)$, as:\n$$g_{\\text{FE}}(\\Delta t) = 1 - 1000\\,\\Delta t$$\n\n**2. Backward Euler Method**\n\nThe Backward Euler (BE) method is an implicit one-step method defined by the recurrence relation:\n$$y_{n+1} = y_n + \\Delta t\\,f(t_{n+1}, y_{n+1})$$\nNote that the function $f$ is evaluated at the future time step $t_{n+1}$. Substituting the given function $f(t_{n+1}, y_{n+1}) = -1000\\,y_{n+1}$ into the BE formula yields:\n$$y_{n+1} = y_n + \\Delta t (-1000\\,y_{n+1})$$\nThis is an equation for the unknown $y_{n+1}$. We must solve for it algebraically:\n$$y_{n+1} + 1000\\,\\Delta t\\,y_{n+1} = y_n$$\n$$y_{n+1}(1 + 1000\\,\\Delta t) = y_n$$\n$$y_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{1 + 1000\\,\\Delta t}\\,y_n$$\nBy comparing this to the form $y_{n+1} = g(\\Delta t)\\,y_n$, we identify the amplification factor for the Backward Euler method, $g_{\\text{BE}}(\\Delta t)$, as:\n$$g_{\\text{BE}}(\\Delta t) = \\frac{1}{1 + 1000\\,\\Delta t}$$\n\n**3. Evaluation of Amplification Factors**\n\nWe now evaluate the magnitude of the amplification factor, $|g(\\Delta t)|$, for each method at the specified time steps.\n\n**Case 1: $\\Delta t = 0.001$**\n\n-   For Forward Euler:\n    $$g_{\\text{FE}}(0.001) = 1 - 1000(0.001) = 1 - 1 = 0$$\n    $$|g_{\\text{FE}}(0.001)| = |0| = 0$$\n-   For Backward Euler:\n    $$g_{\\text{BE}}(0.001) = \\frac{1}{1 + 1000(0.001)} = \\frac{1}{1 + 1} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n    $$|g_{\\text{BE}}(0.001)| = \\left|\\frac{1}{2}\\right| = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\n**Case 2: $\\Delta t = 1$**\n\n-   For Forward Euler:\n    $$g_{\\text{FE}}(1) = 1 - 1000(1) = -999$$\n    $$|g_{\\text{FE}}(1)| = |-999| = 999$$\n-   For Backward Euler:\n    $$g_{\\text{BE}}(1) = \\frac{1}{1 + 1000(1)} = \\frac{1}{1001}$$\n    $$|g_{\\text{BE}}(1)| = \\left|\\frac{1}{1001}\\right| = \\frac{1}{1001}$$\n\n**4. Interpretation and Implications for Stiffness**\n\nThe true solution to $y'(t) = -1000\\,y(t)$ is $y(t) = y_0 \\exp(-1000 t)$, which decays rapidly to zero. A numerically stable method should produce a solution that also decays, meaning the magnitude of the numerical solution should not increase. This requires that the amplification factor's magnitude be less than or equal to one: $|g(\\Delta t)| \\leq 1$.\n\n-   **Forward Euler (Explicit Method)**:\n    The stability condition is $|g_{\\text{FE}}(\\Delta t)| = |1 - 1000\\,\\Delta t| \\leq 1$. This inequality holds only if $-1 \\leq 1 - 1000\\,\\Delta t \\leq 1$, which simplifies to $0 \\leq \\Delta t \\leq \\frac{2}{1000} = 0.002$. The stability of the FE method is therefore conditional on the time step.\n    -   At $\\Delta t = 0.001$, the condition is met. $|g_{\\text{FE}}(0.001)| = 0 \\leq 1$, so the method is stable. It is, in fact, so dissipative that it damps the solution to zero in a single step.\n    -   At $\\Delta t = 1$, the condition is violated. $|g_{\\text{FE}}(1)| = 999 \\gg 1$. The method is violently unstable. Each step amplifies the previous value by a factor of $-999$, leading to catastrophic error growth with sign oscillations, a hallmark of numerical instability for stiff systems.\n\n-   **Backward Euler (Implicit Method)**:\n    The stability condition is $|g_{\\text{BE}}(\\Delta t)| = |\\frac{1}{1 + 1000\\,\\Delta t}| \\leq 1$. Since $\\Delta t > 0$, the denominator $1 + 1000\\,\\Delta t$ is always greater than $1$. Therefore, $0 < g_{\\text{BE}}(\\Delta t) < 1$ for all $\\Delta t > 0$. The magnitude is always less than $1$. The BE method is unconditionally stable for this problem (a property known as A-stability).\n    -   At $\\Delta t = 0.001$, $|g_{\\text{BE}}(0.001)| = 1/2 < 1$. The method is stable and produces a decaying solution.\n    -   At $\\Delta t = 1$, $|g_{\\text{BE}}(1)| = 1/1001 < 1$. The method remains stable, even with a time step that is orders of magnitude larger than the characteristic time scale of the decay ($1/1000\\,s$).\n\n**Conclusion on Stiffness**: This problem exemplifies stiffness. The fast decay process (with characteristic time $1/1000\\,s$) imposes a severe stability constraint on the explicit Forward Euler method ($\\Delta t \\leq 0.002\\,s$), even if we are interested in system dynamics over much longer time scales. The implicit Backward Euler method, being unconditionally stable, is not subject to this constraint and can take large time steps, making it far more efficient for integrating stiff systems like those common in environmental modeling where chemical, physical, and biological processes occur on vastly different timescales.",

Stiffness in a system of ODEs (resulting from spatial discretization of a PDE) arises from the presence of widely differing characteristic time scales. The stability of an explicit method is governed by the fastest process (shortest time scale).\nThe stability condition $\\frac{1}{\\Delta t} \\ge \\frac{u}{\\Delta x} + \\frac{2D}{(\\Delta x)^2} + k$ shows that the overall time step restriction is a harmonic sum of restrictions from each individual process: advection, diffusion, and reaction. We can identify the characteristic time scale associated with the stability limit of each process:\n- Advective time scale (Courant number limit): $\\tau_{\\text{adv}} = \\frac{\\Delta x}{u} = \\frac{50}{0.5} = 100\\ \\mathrm{s}$.\n- Diffusive time scale (Fourier number limit): $\\tau_{\\text{diff}} = \\frac{(\\Delta x)^2}{2D} = \\frac{50^2}{2(0.01)} = \\frac{2500}{0.02} = 125000\\ \\mathrm{s}$.\n- Reactive time scale: $\\tau_{\\text{react}} = \\frac{1}{k} = \\frac{1}{0.2} = 5\\ \\mathrm{s}$.\n\nThe system exhibits a large separation of time scales: $\\tau_{\\text{react}} (5\\ \\mathrm{s}) \\ll \\tau_{\\text{adv}} (100\\ \\mathrm{s}) \\ll \\tau_{\\text{diff}} (125000\\ \\mathrm{s})$. This is the definition of a numerically stiff problem. The fastest process, the chemical reaction, dictates the stability limit. The computed maximum time step $\\Delta t_{\\text{max}} \\approx 4.762\\ \\mathrm{s}$ is very close to and is dominated by the reactive time scale $\\tau_{\\text{react}} = 5\\ \\mathrm{s}$. This forces the simulation to proceed with very small time steps to maintain stability, even though the solute transport by advection and especially diffusion occurs on much longer time scales. This is computationally inefficient and is the primary challenge of modeling stiff systems with explicit methods. The process that dominates the time step restriction is the first-order decay (reaction).",

Let $C_i^n$ be the numerical approximation of the concentration $C(x,t)$ at spatial node $x_i = i\\Delta x$ and time $t_n = n\\Delta t$.\n\nThe discrete approximations for the terms in the PDE at grid point $(i, n+1)$ are:\nTime derivative:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} \\approx \\frac{C_i^{n+1} - C_i^n}{\\Delta t} $$\nAdvection term (centered difference):\n$$ v\\,\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} \\approx v \\left( \\frac{C_{i+1}^{n+1} - C_{i-1}^{n+1}}{2 \\Delta x} \\right) $$\nDiffusion term (centered difference):\n$$ D\\,\\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2} \\approx D \\left( \\frac{C_{i+1}^{n+1} - 2C_i^{n+1} + C_{i-1}^{n+1}}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\right) $$\nReaction term:\n$$ -k\\,C \\approx -k\\,C_i^{n+1} $$\nSubstituting these into the governing PDE yields the fully discrete equation:\n$$\n\\frac{C_i^{n+1} - C_i^n}{\\Delta t} + v \\left( \\frac{C_{i+1}^{n+1} - C_{i-1}^{n+1}}{2 \\Delta x} \\right) = D \\left( \\frac{C_{i+1}^{n+1} - 2C_i^{n+1} + C_{i-1}^{n+1}}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\right) - k C_i^{n+1}\n$$\n\n**Derivation of the Tridiagonal Stencil**\nTo derive the stencil, we rearrange the equation to group all terms at the new time level $n+1$ on the left-hand side (LHS) and terms at the old time level $n$ on the right-hand side (RHS).\n$$\n\\frac{C_i^{n+1}}{\\Delta t} + v \\frac{C_{i+1}^{n+1}}{2 \\Delta x} - v \\frac{C_{i-1}^{n+1}}{2 \\Delta x} - D \\frac{C_{i+1}^{n+1}}{(\\Delta x)^2} + 2D \\frac{C_i^{n+1}}{(\\Delta x)^2} - D \\frac{C_{i-1}^{n+1}}{(\\Delta x)^2} + k C_i^{n+1} = \\frac{C_i^n}{\\Delta t}\n$$\nCollecting terms for $C_{i-1}^{n+1}$, $C_i^{n+1}$, and $C_{i+1}^{n+1}$ on the LHS:\n$$\n\\left( -\\frac{v}{2 \\Delta x} - \\frac{D}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\right) C_{i-1}^{n+1} + \\left( \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} + \\frac{2D}{(\\Delta x)^2} + k \\right) C_i^{n+1} + \\left( \\frac{v}{2 \\Delta x} - \\frac{D}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\right) C_{i+1}^{n+1} = \\frac{C_i^n}{\\Delta t}\n$$\nThe three coefficients of the tridiagonal stencil at an interior node $i$ are:\n- Coefficient of $C_{i-1}^{n+1}$: $a_{i-1} = -\\frac{v}{2 \\Delta x} - \\frac{D}{(\\Delta x)^2}$\n- Coefficient of $C_i^{n+1}$: $a_i = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} + \\frac{2D}{(\\Delta x)^2} + k$\n- Coefficient of $C_{i+1}^{n+1}$: $a_{i+1} = \\frac{v}{2 \\Delta x} - \\frac{D}{(\\Delta x)^2}$\n\n**Monotonicity Condition**\nFor the numerical solution to be free of spurious oscillations (i.e., to satisfy a discrete maximum principle), the coefficient matrix of the linear system must be an M-matrix. A sufficient condition for a tridiagonal matrix to be an M-matrix is that its diagonal entries are positive and its off-diagonal entries are non-positive.\nThe diagonal entry, $a_i = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t} + \\frac{2D}{(\\Delta x)^2} + k$, is always positive for $\\Delta t > 0$, $D \\ge 0$, and $k \\ge 0$.\nThe off-diagonal entries must be non-positive:\n$1.$ $a_{i-1} \\le 0 \\implies -\\frac{v}{2 \\Delta x} - \\frac{D}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\le 0 \\implies \\frac{v}{2\\Delta x} + \\frac{D}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\ge 0$. Assuming $v>0$, this condition is always met.\n$2.$ $a_{i+1} \\le 0 \\implies \\frac{v}{2 \\Delta x} - \\frac{D}{(\\Delta x)^2} \\le 0 \\implies \\frac{v}{2 \\Delta x} \\le \\frac{D}{(\\Delta x)^2}$.\nMultiplying by $2(\\Delta x)^2 / D$ (assuming $D>0$), we get:\n$$\n\\frac{v \\Delta x}{D} \\le 2\n$$\nThis inequality defines the grid Péclet number, $Pe_{\\Delta x} = \\frac{v \\Delta x}{D}$. The condition for monotonicity is $Pe_{\\Delta x} \\le 2$.\n\n**Analysis of the Scheme with Given Parameters**\nThe physical and numerical parameters are given as:\n$v = 7.2 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$D = 1.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n$\\Delta x = 2.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n\nWe calculate the grid Péclet number:\n$$\nPe_{\\Delta x} = \\frac{v \\Delta x}{D} = \\frac{(7.2 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(2.5 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{m})}{1.0 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{1.8 \\times 10^{-6}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-9}} = 1800\n$$\nSince $Pe_{\\Delta x} = 1800 \\gg 2$, the monotonicity condition is severely violated. This means the off-diagonal matrix entry corresponding to the coefficient of $C_{i+1}^{n+1}$ is positive, so the matrix is not an M-matrix. Consequently, the discrete maximum principle is not satisfied. The fully implicit scheme is unconditionally stable (A-stable), meaning numerical errors will not grow unboundedly in time. However, stability does not guarantee the absence of non-physical oscillations (overshoots and undershoots), particularly near sharp gradients like the advancing front. The large Péclet number indicates strong advection dominance at the grid scale, which, when coupled with a centered difference approximation for the advection term, is the cause of these spurious oscillations.\n\n**Monotonicity-Preserving Modifications**\n\n(i) **Change Advection Discretization**: A standard way to restore monotonicity is to replace the centered difference scheme for advection with a first-order upwind scheme. Since velocity $v > 0$, we use a backward difference: $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} \\approx \\frac{C_i^{n+1} - C_{i-1}^{n+1}}{\\Delta x}$. This makes the off-diagonal coefficients unconditionally non-positive, ensuring the matrix is an M-matrix and the scheme is monotone, at the cost of introducing numerical diffusion which may excessively smear sharp fronts.\n\n(ii) **Additive Artificial Diffusion**: Another approach is to retain the centered scheme but add sufficient a-priori artificial diffusion, $D_{\\text{art}}$, to satisfy the monotonicity condition. We replace the physical diffusion $D$ with an effective diffusion $D_{\\text{eff}} = D + D_{\\text{art}}$. The monotonicity condition becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{v \\Delta x}{D_{\\text{eff}}} \\le 2 \\implies \\frac{v \\Delta x}{D + D_{\\text{art}}} \\le 2\n$$\nTo find the minimum required artificial diffusion, we set the condition to equality:\n$$\n\\frac{v \\Delta x}{D + D_{\\text{art}}} = 2\n$$\nSolving for $D_{\\text{art}}$:\n$$\nD + D_{\\text{art}} = \\frac{v \\Delta x}{2}\n$$\n$$\nD_{\\text{art}} = \\frac{v \\Delta x}{2} - D\n$$\nSubstituting the given numerical values:\n$$\nD_{\\text{art}} = \\frac{(7.2 \\times 10^{-4}) \\times (2.5 \\times 10^{-3})}{2} - (1.0 \\times 10^{-9})\n$$\n$$\nD_{\\text{art}} = \\frac{1.8 \\times 10^{-6}}{2} - 1.0 \\times 10^{-9}\n$$\n$$\nD_{\\text{art}} = 9.0 \\times 10^{-7} - 1.0 \\times 10^{-9}\n$$\n$$\nD_{\\text{art}} = 900 \\times 10^{-9} - 1.0 \\times 10^{-9} = 899 \\times 10^{-9}\n$$\n$$\nD_{\\text{art}} = 8.99 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThis is the minimum value of artificial diffusion required to make the centered scheme monotone for the given grid. Rounding to three significant figures, the value is $8.99 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{m}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.",
