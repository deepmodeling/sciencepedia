All provided information is self-consistent and sufficient for a unique solution. The phase function, $P(\\mu)$, is presented as a standard Legendre polynomial expansion, and its claimed properties of normalization and non-negativity are verifiable and correct. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into three parts: deriving the expression for the asymmetry parameter $g$, calculating its value for the given phase function, and explaining its physical significance.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the expression for the asymmetry parameter $g$**\n\nThe asymmetry parameter, $g$, is defined as the expectation value of the cosine of the scattering angle, $\\theta$. The scattering angle is the angle between the incident direction $\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}'$ and the scattered direction $\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}$, with $\\mu = \\cos\\theta = \\hat{\\mathbf{s}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{s}}'$. The probability density function for scattering into a solid angle element $\\mathrm{d}\\Omega$ around the direction $\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}$ is given by $\\frac{P(\\hat{\\mathbf{s}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{s}}')}{4\\pi}$, where $P$ is the phase function. The normalization condition $\\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\int_{4\\pi} P(\\hat{\\mathbf{s}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{s}}') \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega = 1$ confirms this is a proper probability distribution over the unit sphere of directions.\n\nThe expectation value of a function $f(\\hat{\\mathbf{s}})$ over this distribution is given by:\n$$\n\\langle f \\rangle = \\int_{4\\pi} f(\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}) \\frac{P(\\hat{\\mathbf{s}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{s}}')}{4\\pi} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega\n$$\nFor the asymmetry parameter $g$, the function is $f(\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}) = \\cos\\theta = \\hat{\\mathbf{s}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{s}}' = \\mu$. Thus, the expression for $g$ is:\n$$\ng = \\langle \\cos\\theta \\rangle = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\int_{4\\pi} (\\hat{\\mathbf{s}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{s}}') P(\\hat{\\mathbf{s}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{s}}') \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega\n$$\nSince the phase function $P$ is given to be axisymmetric, it depends only on $\\mu = \\cos\\theta$. We can evaluate the integral in a spherical coordinate system where the incident direction $\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}'$ is aligned with the z-axis. The solid angle element is $\\mathrm{d}\\Omega = \\sin\\theta \\, \\mathrm{d}\\theta \\, \\mathrm{d}\\phi$. The integration limits are $\\phi \\in [0, 2\\pi]$ and $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi]$.\n$$\ng = \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} \\cos\\theta \\, P(\\cos\\theta) \\sin\\theta \\, \\mathrm{d}\\theta \\, \\mathrm{d}\\phi\n$$\nThe integrand is independent of the azimuthal angle $\\phi$, so the integral over $\\phi$ yields a factor of $2\\pi$:\n$$\ng = \\frac{2\\pi}{4\\pi} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} P(\\cos\\theta) \\cos\\theta \\sin\\theta \\, \\mathrm{d}\\theta = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{\\pi} P(\\cos\\theta) \\cos\\theta \\sin\\theta \\, \\mathrm{d}\\theta\n$$\nTo simplify the integral, we perform a change of variables to $\\mu = \\cos\\theta$. This implies $\\mathrm{d}\\mu = -\\sin\\theta \\, \\mathrm{d}\\theta$. The limits of integration change from $\\theta=0$ to $\\mu=1$ and from $\\theta=\\pi$ to $\\mu=-1$.\n$$\ng = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{1}^{-1} P(\\mu) \\mu (-\\mathrm{d}\\mu) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-1}^{1} \\mu P(\\mu) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\mu\n$$\nThis is the required general expression relating the asymmetry parameter $g$ to the phase function $P(\\mu)$.\n\n**Part 2: Computation of $g$**\n\nWe are given the phase function:\n$$\nP(\\mu) = 1 + a\\,\\mu + b\\,\\frac{3\\mu^{2} - 1}{2}\n$$\nwith $a=1.2$ and $b=0.5$. Substituting this into the derived expression for $g$:\n$$\ng = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-1}^{1} \\mu \\left( 1 + a\\,\\mu + b\\,\\frac{3\\mu^{2} - 1}{2} \\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\mu\n$$\nDistributing the $\\mu$ term inside the integral:\n$$\ng = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-1}^{1} \\left( \\mu + a\\,\\mu^{2} + b\\,\\frac{3\\mu^{3} - \\mu}{2} \\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\mu\n$$\nWe evaluate the integral term by term. The integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval like $[-1, 1]$ is zero. The terms $\\mu$ and $(3\\mu^3 - \\mu)$ are odd functions of $\\mu$. Thus, their integrals from $-1$ to $1$ are zero.\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} \\mu \\, \\mathrm{d}\\mu = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\int_{-1}^{1} \\left( \\frac{3\\mu^{3} - \\mu}{2} \\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\mu = 0\n$$\nThe only non-vanishing term is the integral of the even function $a\\mu^2$:\n$$\ng = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-1}^{1} a\\,\\mu^{2} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\mu = \\frac{a}{2} \\left[ \\frac{\\mu^{3}}{3} \\right]_{-1}^{1} = \\frac{a}{2} \\left( \\frac{1^{3}}{3} - \\frac{(-1)^{3}}{3} \\right) = \\frac{a}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{3} - \\left(-\\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{a}{2} \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right) = \\frac{a}{3}\n$$\nThis result can also be obtained by recognizing that the given phase function is an expansion in Legendre polynomials $P_l(\\mu)$: $P_0(\\mu)=1$, $P_1(\\mu)=\\mu$, $P_2(\\mu)=(3\\mu^2-1)/2$. So, $P(\\mu) = P_0(\\mu) + aP_1(\\mu) + bP_2(\\mu)$. The asymmetry parameter $g$ is proportional to the first moment of the expansion. Using the orthogonality property $\\int_{-1}^{1} P_l(\\mu) P_m(\\mu) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\mu = \\frac{2}{2l+1} \\delta_{lm}$:\n$$\ng = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-1}^{1} P_1(\\mu) P(\\mu) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\mu = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{-1}^{1} P_1(\\mu) (P_0(\\mu) + aP_1(\\mu) + bP_2(\\mu)) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\mu = \\frac{a}{2} \\int_{-1}^{1} (P_1(\\mu))^2 \\, \\mathrm{d}\\mu = \\frac{a}{2} \\left( \\frac{2}{2(1)+1} \\right) = \\frac{a}{3}\n$$\nGiven the value $a = 1.2$, we calculate $g$:\n$$\ng = \\frac{1.2}{3} = 0.4\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Physical meaning of $g$**\n\nTo understand the physical meaning of $g$, we examine the first angular moment of the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE). The first moment is obtained by multiplying the RTE by $\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}$ and integrating over the full solid angle $4\\pi$.\n$$\n\\int_{4\\pi} \\hat{\\mathbf{s}} (\\hat{\\mathbf{s}} \\cdot \\nabla I) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega = -\\beta_{\\mathrm{ext}} \\int_{4\\pi} \\hat{\\mathbf{s}} I \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega + \\beta_{\\mathrm{sca}} \\int_{4\\pi} \\hat{\\mathbf{s}} \\left( \\frac{1}{4\\pi} \\int_{4\\pi} P(\\hat{\\mathbf{s}} \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{s}}')I(\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}') \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega' \\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega + \\int_{4\\pi} \\hat{\\mathbf{s}} S \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega\n$$\nLet us define the radiative flux vector $\\mathbf{F} = \\int_{4\\pi} \\hat{\\mathbf{s}} I \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega$ and the radiation pressure tensor $\\mathbf{P} = \\int_{4\\pi} \\hat{\\mathbf{s}}\\hat{\\mathbf{s}} I \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega$. The first term becomes $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{P}$. The extinction term is $-\\beta_{\\mathrm{ext}}\\mathbf{F}$.\nThe scattering term is $\\frac{\\beta_{\\mathrm{sca}}}{4\\pi} \\int_{4\\pi} \\int_{4\\pi} \\hat{\\mathbf{s}} P(\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}') I(\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}') \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega' \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega$. By swapping the order of integration, we get $\\frac{\\beta_{\\mathrm{sca}}}{4\\pi} \\int_{4\\pi} I(\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}') \\left( \\int_{4\\pi} \\hat{\\mathbf{s}} P(\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}\\cdot\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}') \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega \\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega'$. The inner integral evaluates to $4\\pi g \\hat{\\mathbf{s}}'$. Thus the scattering term simplifies to $g \\beta_{\\mathrm{sca}} \\int_{4\\pi} \\hat{\\mathbf{s}}' I(\\hat{\\mathbf{s}}') \\, \\mathrm{d}\\Omega' = g \\beta_{\\mathrm{sca}} \\mathbf{F}$.\nThe first moment equation thus becomes:\n$$\n\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{P} = - \\beta_{\\mathrm{ext}} \\mathbf{F} + g \\beta_{\\mathrm{sca}} \\mathbf{F} + \\mathbf{S}_1 = - (\\beta_{\\mathrm{ext}} - g \\beta_{\\mathrm{sca}}) \\mathbf{F} + \\mathbf{S}_1\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{S}_1$ is the first moment of the source term.\nUsing $\\beta_{\\mathrm{ext}} = \\beta_{\\mathrm{sca}} + \\beta_{\\mathrm{abs}}$ (absorption coefficient), the term multiplying the flux is $-(\\beta_{\\mathrm{sca}} + \\beta_{\\mathrm{abs}} - g \\beta_{\\mathrm{sca}})\\mathbf{F} = -(\\beta_{\\mathrm{abs}} + (1-g)\\beta_{\\mathrm{sca}})\\mathbf{F}$.\nThis defines the transport extinction coefficient $\\beta_{\\mathrm{tr}} = \\beta_{\\mathrm{abs}} + (1-g)\\beta_{\\mathrm{sca}}$.\n\nThe physical meaning of $g$ is now apparent. It modifies the scattering coefficient to an effective value, $(1-g)\\beta_{\\mathrm{sca}}$, called the transport scattering coefficient.\n-   If scattering is isotropic, $g=0$, and the transport scattering coefficient is simply $\\beta_{\\mathrm{sca}}$.\n-   If scattering is strongly forward-peaked ($g \\to 1$), a scattering event barely changes the photon's direction. The term $(1-g)\\beta_{\\mathrm{sca}} \\to 0$. Many forward-scattering events are required to randomize the photon's direction, making scattering inefficient at driving the radiation field toward isotropy. The effective mean free path for transport, $1/\\beta_{\\mathrm{tr}}$, becomes long.\n-   If scattering is strongly backward-peaked ($g \\to -1$), the term $(1-g)\\beta_{\\mathrm{sca}} \\to 2\\beta_{\\mathrm{sca}}$. A backscattering event is highly effective at reversing the flux, making it twice as effective as isotropic scattering at randomizing the net transport of energy.\n\nIn diffusion-type approximations, where the flux is related to the gradient of the energy density ($U$) by $\\mathbf{F} \\approx -D \\nabla U$, the diffusion coefficient is $D = (3\\beta_{\\mathrm{tr}})^{-1} = (3(\\beta_{\\mathrm{abs}} + (1-g)\\beta_{\\mathrm{sca}}))^{-1}$. Thus, the asymmetry parameter $g$ directly controls the rate of diffusive transport by determining how effectively each scattering event contributes to randomizing the direction of radiative flux. A higher $g$ (more forward scattering) leads to a larger diffusion coefficient and more efficient energy transport through the medium.",

Two related but distinct concepts are central: the hygroscopic growth factor and activation. The hygroscopic growth factor is defined as $GF = D_{RH}/D_{dry}$, where $D_{RH}$ is the particle diameter at ambient relative humidity and $D_{dry}$ is the particle diameter under dry conditions. Activation refers to the transition of a wet aerosol particle into a cloud droplet once it surpasses its Köhler maximum and continues to grow at supersaturation.\n\nStarting from first principles, use the following bases:\n- Köhler theory expresses the equilibrium saturation ratio over a solution droplet as $S = a_{w} \\times \\text{(curvature factor)}$, where $a_{w}$ is the water activity.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically evaluated and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of atmospheric aerosol physics, is well-posed with all necessary definitions and parameters provided for a unique solution, and is formulated objectively. The problem relies on standard, formalizable concepts such as the $\\kappa$-parameterization of hygroscopicity and a simplified form of Köhler theory, which are central to modeling aerosol-climate interactions. The provided numerical values are physically realistic.\n\nFirst, we must distinguish between the hygroscopic growth factor ($GF$) and activation in the context of aerosol direct and indirect effects.\nThe hygroscopic growth factor, $GF$, quantifies the continuous increase in an aerosol particle's size due to water uptake as ambient relative humidity ($RH$) increases under subsaturated conditions (i.e., for $RH  1$). The change in particle size, and consequently its refractive index, alters the particle's ability to scatter and absorb solar radiation. This phenomenon is a key component of the **aerosol direct effect**, which describes the immediate impact of aerosols on the Earth's radiative balance by directly interacting with radiation.\nActivation, in contrast, is a threshold phenomenon that occurs under supersaturated conditions (i.e., when the saturation ratio $S  1$, which corresponds to $RH  100\\%$). An aerosol particle that serves as a cloud condensation nucleus (CCN) will grow by water vapor diffusion. According to Köhler theory, the equilibrium saturation ratio over the particle surface first increases with size (due to the solute effect being dominant) and then decreases (as the curvature effect becomes dominant for larger sizes). The peak of this Köhler curve represents a critical supersaturation and a critical diameter. If the ambient supersaturation exceeds this critical value, the particle is said to activate and undergoes unrestrained growth to become a cloud droplet. This process determines the number concentration of cloud droplets, which in turn influences cloud properties such as albedo (the Twomey effect) and cloud lifetime (the Albrecht effect). These modifications to cloud properties constitute the **aerosol indirect effects**.\nIn summary, $GF$ describes sub-saturated, continuous growth relevant to the direct effect, while activation is a super-saturated, threshold transition from an aerosol particle to a cloud droplet, which is fundamental to the indirect effect.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for $GF$ in terms of $RH$ and the hygroscopicity parameter $\\kappa$.\nThe starting point is the definition of the $\\kappa$-parameterization:\n$$ \\kappa \\equiv \\left(\\frac{V_{w}}{V_{dry}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1 - a_{w}}{a_{w}}\\right) $$\nwhere $V_{w}$ is the volume of water in the droplet, $V_{dry}$ is the volume of the dry aerosol particle, and $a_{w}$ is the water activity in the solution droplet.\n\nThe problem states that for subsaturated conditions and sufficiently large particles, the Kelvin (curvature) effect can be neglected. Under this approximation, thermodynamic equilibrium between the particle and the surrounding water vapor is achieved when the water activity equals the ambient relative humidity (expressed as a fraction).\n$$ a_{w} = RH $$\nSubstituting this into the $\\kappa$ expression gives:\n$$ \\kappa = \\left(\\frac{V_{w}}{V_{dry}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{1 - RH}{RH}\\right) $$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for the ratio of the volume of water to the volume of the dry particle:\n$$ \\frac{V_{w}}{V_{dry}} = \\kappa \\frac{RH}{1 - RH} $$\nThe total volume of the wet particle, $V_{RH}$, is the sum of the dry particle volume and the absorbed water volume:\n$$ V_{RH} = V_{dry} + V_{w} $$\nDividing by $V_{dry}$ gives the ratio of the wet volume to the dry volume:\n$$ \\frac{V_{RH}}{V_{dry}} = 1 + \\frac{V_{w}}{V_{dry}} $$\nSubstituting our expression for $\\frac{V_{w}}{V_{dry}}$ yields:\n$$ \\frac{V_{RH}}{V_{dry}} = 1 + \\kappa \\frac{RH}{1 - RH} $$\nThe hygroscopic growth factor, $GF$, is defined as the ratio of the wet particle diameter, $D_{RH}$, to the dry particle diameter, $D_{dry}$:\n$$ GF = \\frac{D_{RH}}{D_{dry}} $$\nAssuming the particles are spherical, their volume $V$ is related to their diameter $D$ by $V = \\frac{\\pi}{6}D^{3}$. Therefore, the ratio of the wet volume to the dry volume can be expressed in terms of the diameters:\n$$ \\frac{V_{RH}}{V_{dry}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi}{6}D_{RH}^{3}}{\\frac{\\pi}{6}D_{dry}^{3}} = \\left(\\frac{D_{RH}}{D_{dry}}\\right)^{3} = GF^{3} $$\nEquating our two expressions for the volume ratio $\\frac{V_{RH}}{V_{dry}}$ gives:\n$$ GF^{3} = 1 + \\kappa \\frac{RH}{1 - RH} $$\nTaking the cube root of both sides gives the final expression for the growth factor:\n$$ GF = \\left(1 + \\kappa \\frac{RH}{1 - RH}\\right)^{1/3} $$\nThis expression relates the growth factor directly to the aerosol hygroscopicity parameter $\\kappa$ and the ambient relative humidity $RH$, and is independent of the particle's dry diameter $D_{dry}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of $GF$ for an aerosol with $\\kappa = 0.30$ at an ambient relative humidity $RH = 0.90$.

The number fraction of each is $50\\%$.\n*   **Internal Mixture**: This consists of a population where every particle is identical and contains all chemical species. Here, each particle is a composite of BC and AS with equal volume fractions.\n\n**2. CCN Activation Analysis**\n\nThe critical supersaturation, $s_c$, is given by the $\\kappa$-Kohler equation:\n$$\ns_c \\;=\\; \\left(\\frac{4 A^3}{27\\,\\kappa\\,D_d^3}\\right)^{1/2}\n$$\nFirst, we calculate the parameter $A$, which depends on the properties of water:\n$$\nA = \\frac{2 \\,\\sigma_w \\, M_w}{R\\,T\\,\\rho_w} = \\frac{2 \\cdot (0.072\\,\\mathrm{N\\,m^{-1}}) \\cdot (0.018\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,mol^{-1}})}{(8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) \\cdot (298\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\cdot (1000\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}})} \\approx 1.046 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe particle dry diameter is given as $D_d = 100\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 1 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}$. We can now calculate $s_c$ as a function of the hygroscopicity parameter $\\kappa$. For convenience, we express $s_c$ in percent ($s_{c,\\%} = s_c \\times 100\\%$).\n$$\ns_{c,\\%} = 100 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{4 \\cdot (1.046 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m})^3}{27 \\cdot \\kappa \\cdot (1 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m})^3}\\right)^{1/2} = 100 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{4.578 \\times 10^{-27}}{27 \\cdot \\kappa \\cdot 10^{-21}}\\right)^{1/2} = 100 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1.696 \\times 10^{-7}}{\\kappa}\\right)^{1/2} \\approx \\frac{0.04118}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}}\\%\n$$\nA particle acts as a CCN if its critical supersaturation $s_c$ is less than or equal to the environmental supersaturation, $s_c \\le s_{\\mathrm{env}}$. Here, $s_{\\mathrm{env}} = 0.1\\%$.\n\n*   **CCN Activation in the External Mixture**:\n    *   For the 50% of particles that are pure BC: $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{BC}} = 0$. This leads to an infinite $s_c$, so these particles do not activate.\n    *   For the 50% of particles that are pure AS: $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{AS}} = 0.6$. Their critical supersaturation is:\n    $$\n    s_{c, \\mathrm{AS}} = \\frac{0.04118}{\\sqrt{0.6}}\\% \\approx \\frac{0.04118}{0.7746}\\% \\approx 0.0532\\%\n    $$\n    Since $s_{c, \\mathrm{AS}} \\approx 0.0532\\%  s_{\\mathrm{env}} = 0.1\\%$, the AS particles activate.\n    *   Conclusion: In the external mixture, only the AS particles ($50\\%$ of the population) activate as CCN.\n\n*   **CCN Activation in the Internal Mixture**:\n    *   All particles are internally mixed with equal volume fractions of BC and AS. The effective hygroscopicity, $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{mix}}$, is the volume-weighted average:\n    $$\n    \\kappa_{\\mathrm{mix}} = \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{BC}}\\kappa_{\\mathrm{BC}} + \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{AS}}\\kappa_{\\mathrm{AS}} = (0.5)(0) + (0.5)(0.6) = 0.3\n    $$\n    *   The critical supersaturation for these identical mixed particles is:\n    $$\n    s_{c, \\mathrm{mix}} = \\frac{0.04118}{\\sqrt{0.3}}\\% \\approx \\frac{0.04118}{0.5477}\\% \\approx 0.0752\\%\n    $$\n    *   Since $s_{c, \\mathrm{mix}} \\approx 0.0752\\%  s_{\\mathrm{env}} = 0.1\\%$, all particles in the internal mixture activate.\n    *   Conclusion: In the internal mixture, all particles ($100\\%$ of the population) activate as CCN.\n\n**3. Absorption Enhancement Analysis**\n\nThe problem provides an idealized parameterization for the absorption enhancement due to the lensing effect in an internal mixture:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{lens}} = 1 + \\alpha \\,\\phi\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha = 0.5$ and $\\phi$ is the shell-to-core volume ratio, $V_{\\mathrm{shell}}/V_{\\mathrm{core}}$. For the lensing effect to be applicable as an enhancement, the absorbing species (BC) must be the core and the non-absorbing species (AS) must be the shell.\n\n*   The problem states that in the internal mixture, each particle has \"equal volume fractions of BC and AS\". This means the volume of BC equals the volume of AS within each particle.\n*   Thus, $V_{\\mathrm{core}} = V_{\\mathrm{BC}}$ and $V_{\\mathrm{shell}} = V_{\\mathrm{AS}}$.\n*   The ratio $\\phi$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\phi = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{shell}}}{V_{\\mathrm{core}}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{AS}}}{V_{\\mathrm{BC}}} = 1\n$$\n*   Plugging this into the enhancement formula:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{lens}} = 1 + (0.5)(1) = 1.5\n$$\n*   Conclusion: The absorption of the population is enhanced by a factor of $1.5$ when it transitions from an external to an internal mixture, according to the specified model.\n\n**4. Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **Option A**: This option states that external mixing involves distinct particles while internal mixing involves composite particles, which is correct. It correctly calculates $\\kappa_{\\mathrm{mix}} = 0.3$. It correctly concludes that all internally mixed particles activate ($s_c \\approx 0.075\\%  0.1\\%$) while only the AS half ($50\\%$) of the externally mixed particles activate ($s_c \\approx 0.053\\%  0.1\\%$). It correctly identifies $\\phi=1$ for equal volumes and calculates the absorption enhancement as $E_{\\mathrm{lens}} = 1.5$. Every statement in this option aligns with the derivations. **Correct**.\n\n*   **Option B**: This option claims that internal mixing decreases absorption ($E_{\\mathrm{lens}}  1$). This contradicts the provided formula $E_{\\mathrm{lens}} = 1 + \\alpha \\phi$, which gives $1.5$ for $\\alpha  0$ and $\\phi  0$. It also incorrectly claims that CCN activation is unchanged by mixing state; our analysis shows the active fraction changes from $50\\%$ to $100\\%$. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option C**: This option incorrectly claims that external and internal mixing are \"compositionally identical at the particle level\". It also incorrectly claims CCN activation is the same in both cases and that there is no absorption enhancement ($E_{\\mathrm{lens}} = 1$). All three points are factually wrong based on the problem setup and our derivations. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **Option D**: This option incorrectly states the absorption enhancement is $E_{\\mathrm{lens}} = 2$. Our calculation yielded $1.5$. It also incorrectly claims that the CCN-active fraction remains at $50\\%$ in the internal mixture; our calculation showed it becomes $100\\%$. **Incorrect**.",
