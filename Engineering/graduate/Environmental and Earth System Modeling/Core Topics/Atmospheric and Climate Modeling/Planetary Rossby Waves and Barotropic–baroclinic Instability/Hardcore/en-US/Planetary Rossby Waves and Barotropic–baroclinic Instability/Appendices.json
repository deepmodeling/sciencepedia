            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the first baroclinic deformation radius in a two-layer shallow-water model, its numerical evaluation, and a qualitative discussion of its role in planetary Rossby wave dynamics.\n\nThe starting point is the set of linearized shallow-water equations for a two-layer fluid on an $f$-plane, under the Boussinesq and rigid-lid approximations. Let the upper layer be denoted by subscript $1$ and the lower layer by subscript $2$. The mean thicknesses are $H_1$ and $H_2$. The horizontal velocity vectors are $\\mathbf{u}_1 = (u_1, v_1)$ and $\\mathbf{u}_2 = (u_2, v_2)$. The interface displacement from its mean position is $\\eta_2$. The rigid-lid approximation implies that the sea surface elevation is negligible and there is a pressure $p_s(x,y,t)$ at the surface $z=0$ that ensures the total volume transport is non-divergent. The reduced gravity is $g'$. The Coriolis parameter is $f_0$.\n\nThe linearized momentum equations are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_1}{\\partial t} + f_0 \\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{u}_1 = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\nabla p_s $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_2}{\\partial t} + f_0 \\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{u}_2 = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\nabla p_s - g' \\nabla \\eta_2 $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{k}$ is the unit vector in the vertical direction and $\\rho_0$ is a reference density.\n\nThe linearized continuity equations are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\eta_2}{\\partial t} - H_1 \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}_1 = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\eta_2}{\\partial t} + H_2 \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}_2 = 0 $$\n\nTo analyze the internal or baroclinic mode of motion, we subtract the two momentum equations. This eliminates the surface pressure $p_s$, which is associated with the barotropic mode. Let us define the baroclinic velocity (or velocity shear) as $\\mathbf{u}_{BC} = \\mathbf{u}_1 - \\mathbf{u}_2$. Subtracting the second momentum equation from the first yields:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial (\\mathbf{u}_1 - \\mathbf{u}_2)}{\\partial t} + f_0 \\mathbf{k} \\times (\\mathbf{u}_1 - \\mathbf{u}_2) = g' \\nabla \\eta_2 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_{BC}}{\\partial t} + f_0 \\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{u}_{BC} = g' \\nabla \\eta_2 $$\n\nNext, we derive a continuity equation involving $\\mathbf{u}_{BC}$. From the two continuity equations, we can express the velocity divergences as:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}_1 = \\frac{1}{H_1} \\frac{\\partial \\eta_2}{\\partial t} $$\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}_2 = -\\frac{1}{H_2} \\frac{\\partial \\eta_2}{\\partial t} $$\nThe divergence of the baroclinic velocity is then:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}_{BC} = \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}_1 - \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}_2 = \\frac{1}{H_1} \\frac{\\partial \\eta_2}{\\partial t} - \\left(-\\frac{1}{H_2} \\frac{\\partial \\eta_2}{\\partial t}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{1}{H_1} + \\frac{1}{H_2}\\right) \\frac{\\partial \\eta_2}{\\partial t} $$\nRearranging this gives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\eta_2}{\\partial t} + \\left(\\frac{H_1 H_2}{H_1 + H_2}\\right) \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}_{BC} = 0 $$\n\nWe have now formulated a closed system of equations for the baroclinic variables $\\mathbf{u}_{BC}$ and $\\eta_2$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_{BC}}{\\partial t} + f_0 \\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{u}_{BC} = g' \\nabla \\eta_2 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial \\eta_2}{\\partial t} + H_e \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u}_{BC} = 0 $$\nwhere we have defined the equivalent depth $H_e = \\frac{H_1 H_2}{H_1 + H_2}$. This system is mathematically identical to the single-layer shallow water equations, with gravity replaced by the reduced gravity $g'$ and the fluid depth replaced by the equivalent depth $H_e$.\n\nThe phase speed of long gravity waves in a single-layer shallow water system with depth $D$ and gravity $g$ is $\\sqrt{gD}$. By analogy, the long-wave internal mode phase speed, $c_i$, for our baroclinic system is:\n$$ c_i = \\sqrt{g' H_e} = \\sqrt{g' \\frac{H_1 H_2}{H_1 + H_2}} $$\nThis is the required expression for the internal wave speed. This speed corresponds to non-rotating ($f_0=0$) long waves. For a rotating fluid, these are internal inertia-gravity waves with the dispersion relation $\\omega^2 = f_0^2 + c_i^2 k^2$, where $k$ is the wavenumber.\n\nThe first baroclinic Rossby radius of deformation, $R_1$, is the length scale at which the Coriolis force becomes comparable to the buoyancy force (represented by $g'$). It is defined as the internal wave speed $c_i$ divided by the Coriolis parameter $f_0$:\n$$ R_1 = \\frac{c_i}{f_0} = \\frac{1}{f_0} \\sqrt{g' \\frac{H_1 H_2}{H_1 + H_2}} $$\nNow, we evaluate this expression using the given values:\n$g' = 0.02\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}$\n$H_1 = 500\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n$H_2 = 3500\\ \\mathrm{m}$\n$f_0 = 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n\nFirst, we compute the equivalent depth $H_e$:\n$$ H_e = \\frac{(500\\ \\mathrm{m})(3500\\ \\mathrm{m})}{500\\ \\mathrm{m} + 3500\\ \\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{1750000\\ \\mathrm{m^2}}{4000\\ \\mathrm{m}} = 437.5\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\nNext, we compute the internal wave speed $c_i$:\n$$ c_i = \\sqrt{(0.02\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}})(437.5\\ \\mathrm{m})} = \\sqrt{8.75\\ \\mathrm{m^2 s^{-2}}} \\approx 2.95804\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}} $$\nFinally, we compute the deformation radius $R_1$:\n$$ R_1 = \\frac{2.95804\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}}{10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{s^{-1}}} = 29580.4\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\nThe problem requires the answer in kilometers, rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ R_1 = 29.5804\\ \\mathrm{km} $$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $29.58\\ \\mathrm{km}$.\n\nFinally, a qualitative discussion is required on the relationship between the long-wave baroclinic planetary Rossby wave phase speed and the deformation radius $R_1$. Planetary Rossby waves arise due to the variation of the Coriolis parameter with latitude, a dependency represented by the beta-plane approximation, where $f = f_0 + \\beta y$.\n\nThe dynamics of these low-frequency waves are described by quasi-geostrophic theory. For the first baroclinic mode in a two-layer model, the dispersion relation for Rossby waves is given by:\n$$ \\omega = -\\frac{\\beta k_x}{k^2 + 1/R_1^2} $$\nwhere $\\omega$ is the wave frequency, $k_x$ is the zonal wavenumber, $k = \\sqrt{k_x^2 + k_y^2}$ is the total wavenumber, and $R_1$ is the first baroclinic deformation radius derived above.\n\nThe zonal phase speed is $c_x = \\omega/k_x$:\n$$ c_x = -\\frac{\\beta}{k^2 + 1/R_1^2} $$\nThe \"long-wave\" limit corresponds to wavelengths much larger than the deformation radius, i.e., $k \\ll 1/R_1$, so $k^2$ can be neglected in the denominator. In this limit, the phase speed becomes:\n$$ c_{x, \\text{long}} \\approx -\\frac{\\beta}{1/R_1^2} = -\\beta R_1^2 $$\nThe negative sign indicates that these long waves always propagate westward (for $\\beta > 0$ in the Northern Hemisphere). The magnitude of the phase speed is $|c_{x, \\text{long}}| = \\beta R_1^2$.\n\nTherefore, for a fixed planetary vorticity gradient $\\beta$, the magnitude of the long-wave baroclinic Rossby wave phase speed is quadratically proportional to the first baroclinic deformation radius ($|c_x| \\propto R_1^2$). A larger deformation radius implies a much faster westward propagation of long baroclinic Rossby waves. The deformation radius thus acts as a critical scale that governs the speed of large-scale climate signals transmitted by these waves.",

The gradients become:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\overline{q}_{1}}{dy} = \\beta + \\frac{f_{0}^{2} S}{g' H_{1}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d\\overline{q}_{2}}{dy} = \\beta - \\frac{f_{0}^{2} S}{g' H_{2}}\n$$\nNext, we evaluate these gradients numerically using the given parameters.\nThe shear is $S = U_{1} - U_{2} = 0.50 \\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1} - 0.20 \\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1} = 0.30 \\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$.\nOther values:\n$f_{0}^2 = (7.0 \\times 10^{-5})^2 = 49 \\times 10^{-10} = 4.9 \\times 10^{-9} \\,\\text{s}^{-2}$.\n$g' H_{1} = (2.0 \\times 10^{-2}) \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{2}) = 10 \\,\\text{m}^2\\,\\text{s}^{-2}$.\n$g' H_{2} = (2.0 \\times 10^{-2}) \\times (3.5 \\times 10^{3}) = 70 \\,\\text{m}^2\\,\\text{s}^{-2}$.\n\nFor layer $1$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\overline{q}_{1}}{dy} = (2.0 \\times 10^{-11}) + \\frac{(4.9 \\times 10^{-9}) \\times 0.30}{10} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-11} + 1.47 \\times 10^{-10} = 1.67 \\times 10^{-10} \\,\\text{m}^{-1}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\nFor layer $2$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\overline{q}_{2}}{dy} = (2.0 \\times 10^{-11}) - \\frac{(4.9 \\times 10^{-9}) \\times 0.30}{70} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-11} - \\frac{1.47 \\times 10^{-9}}{70} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-11} - 0.21 \\times 10^{-10} = 2.0 \\times 10^{-11} - 2.1 \\times 10^{-11} = -0.1 \\times 10^{-11} = -1.0 \\times 10^{-12} \\,\\text{m}^{-1}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe Charney–Stern necessary condition for baroclinic instability states that the meridional gradient of the mean PV must change sign within the fluid domain. In a two-layer model, this implies that the gradients in the two layers must have opposite signs:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{d\\overline{q}_{1}}{dy}\\right) \\left(\\frac{d\\overline{q}_{2}}{dy}\\right)  0\n$$\nOur numerical evaluation shows that for the given parameters, $\\frac{d\\overline{q}_{1}}{dy}  0$ and $\\frac{d\\overline{q}_{2}}{dy}  0$, so the necessary condition is indeed satisfied.\n\nTo find the minimum positive shear $S_{\\text{crit}}$ for instability, we analyze the signs of the gradients. Since $\\beta  0$ and the problem specifies $S = U_{1} - U_{2}  0$, the gradient in layer $1$, $\\frac{d\\overline{q}_{1}}{dy} = \\beta + \\frac{f_{0}^{2} S}{g' H_{1}}$, is always positive. Therefore, the instability condition requires the gradient in layer $2$ to be negative:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\overline{q}_{2}}{dy} = \\beta - \\frac{f_{0}^{2} S}{g' H_{2}}  0\n$$\nThis inequality can be rearranged to find the condition on the shear $S$:\n$$\nS  \\frac{\\beta g' H_{2}}{f_{0}^{2}}\n$$\nThe critical shear $S_{\\text{crit}}$ is the minimum value of $S$ that satisfies this condition, which corresponds to the boundary where the gradient is zero:\n$$\nS_{\\text{crit}} = \\frac{\\beta g' H_{2}}{f_{0}^{2}}\n$$\nNow we compute the value of $S_{\\text{crit}}$:\n$$\nS_{\\text{crit}} = \\frac{(2.0 \\times 10^{-11} \\,\\text{m}^{-1}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}) \\times (70 \\,\\text{m}^2\\,\\text{s}^{-2})}{4.9 \\times 10^{-9} \\,\\text{s}^{-2}} = \\frac{1.4 \\times 10^{-9}}{4.9 \\times 10^{-9}} \\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1} = \\frac{14}{49} \\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1} = \\frac{2}{7} \\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\nNumerically, $S_{\\text{crit}} \\approx 0.285714... \\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the instability margin $M = S - S_{\\text{crit}}$:\n$$\nS = 0.30 \\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1} = \\frac{3}{10} \\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\nM = \\frac{3}{10} - \\frac{2}{7} = \\frac{3 \\times 7 - 2 \\times 10}{70} = \\frac{21 - 20}{70} = \\frac{1}{70} \\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\nNow, we express this value numerically and round to four significant figures:\n$$\nM = \\frac{1}{70} \\approx 0.0142857... \\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives:\n$$\nM \\approx 0.01429 \\,\\text{m}\\,\\text{s}^{-1}\n$$\nSince $M  0$, the flow is unstable according to the necessary condition.",
