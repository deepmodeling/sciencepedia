            "solution": "The problem requires a dimensional analysis of two quantities central to the Sverdrup balance in wind-driven ocean circulation: the planetary vorticity advection term, $\\beta V$, and the wind stress curl term, $(\\operatorname{curl}_z \\boldsymbol{\\tau}) / \\rho_0$. The objective is to determine the SI base-unit power vector for each quantity and verify their identity. We will use the fundamental dimensions of mass ($M$), length ($L$), and time ($T$), which correspond to the SI base units kilogram ($\\mathrm{kg}$), meter ($\\mathrm{m}$), and second ($\\mathrm{s}$), respectively.\n\nFirst, we analyze the term $\\beta V$. This requires finding the dimensions of $\\beta$ and $V$ separately.\n\nThe meridional gradient of the Coriolis parameter is $\\beta = \\partial f / \\partial y$. The dimensions of $\\beta$, denoted as $[\\beta]$, are the dimensions of $f$ divided by the dimensions of $y$.\nThe Coriolis parameter $f$ is given by $f = 2 \\Omega \\sin \\varphi$.\n- The factor of $2$ is a dimensionless number.\n- The Earth's rotation rate $\\Omega$ is given to have dimensions of inverse time, so $[\\Omega] = T^{-1}$.\n- The latitude $\\varphi$ and its sine, $\\sin \\varphi$, are dimensionless quantities.\nTherefore, the dimensions of the Coriolis parameter are $[f] = T^{-1}$.\nThe meridional coordinate $y$ is a length, so $[y] = L$.\nCombining these, the dimensions of $\\beta$ are:\n$$ [\\beta] = \\frac{[f]}{[y]} = \\frac{T^{-1}}{L} = L^{-1} T^{-1} $$\n\nNext, we find the dimensions of the meridional transport $V$. The definition is $V = \\int v \\, \\mathrm{d}z$. The dimensions of an integral are the product of the dimensions of the integrand and the differential.\n- The meridional velocity $v$ has dimensions of length per time, so $[v] = L T^{-1}$.\n- The depth coordinate $z$ is a length, so the differential $\\mathrm{d}z$ also has dimensions of length, $[\\mathrm{d}z] = L$.\nThe dimensions of the meridional transport $V$ are therefore:\n$$ [V] = [v] [z] = (L T^{-1}) (L) = L^2 T^{-1} $$\n\nNow, we can find the dimensions of the product $\\beta V$:\n$$ [\\beta V] = [\\beta] [V] = (L^{-1} T^{-1}) (L^2 T^{-1}) = L^{(-1+2)} T^{(-1-1)} = L^1 T^{-2} $$\nIn terms of base SI units $(\\mathrm{kg}, \\mathrm{m}, \\mathrm{s})$, the corresponding dimensions are $M^0 L^1 T^{-2}$. This gives the power vector $(0, 1, -2)$.\n\nSecond, we analyze the term $(\\operatorname{curl}_z \\boldsymbol{\\tau}) / \\rho_0$. We first determine the dimensions of the numerator, $\\operatorname{curl}_z \\boldsymbol{\\tau}$.\n\nThe wind stress $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ is a force per unit area, given with dimensions of $\\mathrm{N}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$.\n- The Newton ($\\mathrm{N}$) is a unit of force, which from Newton's second law ($F=ma$) has dimensions of mass times acceleration. So, $[\\mathrm{N}] = M L T^{-2}$.\n- Area has dimensions of $L^2$.\nTherefore, the dimensions of wind stress are:\n$$ [\\boldsymbol{\\tau}] = \\frac{M L T^{-2}}{L^2} = M L^{-1} T^{-2} $$\n\nThe vertical component of the horizontal curl of the wind stress is $\\operatorname{curl}_z \\boldsymbol{\\tau} = \\partial \\tau_y / \\partial x - \\partial \\tau_x / \\partial y$. The differentiation with respect to a spatial coordinate ($x$ or $y$) introduces a dimension of inverse length, $L^{-1}$.\nThe dimensions of $\\operatorname{curl}_z \\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ are thus:\n$$ [\\operatorname{curl}_z \\boldsymbol{\\tau}] = \\frac{[\\boldsymbol{\\tau}]}{L} = \\frac{M L^{-1} T^{-2}}{L} = M L^{-2} T^{-2} $$\n\nNext, we consider the denominator, the reference density $\\rho_0$.\n- Density is mass per unit volume. Volume has dimensions of $L^3$.\nThe dimensions of $\\rho_0$ are given as $\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$, which corresponds to:\n$$ [\\rho_0] = M L^{-3} $$\n\nFinally, we combine the dimensions of the numerator and denominator to find the dimensions of the entire expression:\n$$ \\left[\\frac{\\operatorname{curl}_z \\boldsymbol{\\tau}}{\\rho_0}\\right] = \\frac{[\\operatorname{curl}_z \\boldsymbol{\\tau}]}{[\\rho_0]} = \\frac{M L^{-2} T^{-2}}{M L^{-3}} = M^{(1-1)} L^{(-2 - (-3))} T^{-2} = M^0 L^1 T^{-2} $$\nIn terms of base SI units $(\\mathrm{kg}, \\mathrm{m}, \\mathrm{s})$, this corresponds to dimensions $M^0 L^1 T^{-2}$. This gives the power vector $(0, 1, -2)$.\n\nBoth quantities, $\\beta V$ and $(\\operatorname{curl}_z \\boldsymbol{\\tau}) / \\rho_0$, have dimensions of $L T^{-2}$, which are the dimensions of acceleration. The dimensional analysis confirms that they are identical, consistent with the physical law known as the Sverdrup balance.

            "solution": "### Derivation of Ekman Pumping Velocity\n\nThe problem specifies that the steady, linear horizontal momentum balance in the Ekman layer is between the Coriolis force and the vertical divergence of turbulent stress. In a standard right-handed coordinate system with $z$ pointing upwards, these equations are:\n$$ -fv = \\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{\\partial \\tau_x}{\\partial z} $$\n$$ fu = \\frac{1}{\\rho}\\frac{\\partial \\tau_y}{\\partial z} $$\nHere, $(u, v)$ are the horizontal velocity components, $f$ is the constant Coriolis parameter, $\\rho$ is the constant density, and $(\\tau_x, \\tau_y)$ are the components of the horizontal turbulent stress vector.\n\nTo find the total transport within the Ekman layer, we integrate these equations vertically from the base of the layer, $z = -h_E$, to the surface, $z=0$:\n$$ \\int_{-h_E}^{0} -fv \\, dz = \\frac{1}{\\rho} \\int_{-h_E}^{0} \\frac{\\partial \\tau_x}{\\partial z} \\, dz $$\n$$ \\int_{-h_E}^{0} fu \\, dz = \\frac{1}{\\rho} \\int_{-h_E}^{0} \\frac{\\partial \\tau_y}{\\partial z} \\, dz $$\n\nLet us define the zonal and meridional Ekman transports, $U_E$ and $V_E$, as the vertically integrated velocities:\n$$ U_E = \\int_{-h_E}^{0} u \\, dz $$\n$$ V_E = \\int_{-h_E}^{0} v \\, dz $$\n\nThe integrated momentum equations become:\n$$ -f V_E = \\frac{1}{\\rho} [\\tau_x(z=0) - \\tau_x(z=-h_E)] $$\n$$ f U_E = \\frac{1}{\\rho} [\\tau_y(z=0) - \\tau_y(z=-h_E)] $$\n\nWe apply the given boundary conditions for the stress. At the surface, the turbulent stress is equal to the surface wind stress, which we denote as $(\\tau_x, \\tau_y)$ following the problem's notation for the curl expression: $\\vec{\\tau}(z=0) = (\\tau_x, \\tau_y)$. At the base of the Ekman layer, the turbulent stress vanishes: $\\vec{\\tau}(z=-h_E) = 0$. Substituting these into the transport equations yields:\n$$ -f V_E = \\frac{\\tau_x}{\\rho} $$\n$$ f U_E = \\frac{\\tau_y}{\\rho} $$\n\nSolving for the Ekman transports, we get:\n$$ U_E = \\frac{\\tau_y}{f\\rho} $$\n$$ V_E = -\\frac{\\tau_x}{f\\rho} $$\nThis shows that the net transport in the Ekman layer is directed to the right of the wind stress in the Northern Hemisphere ($f>0$) and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere ($f0$).\n\nNext, we use the principle of mass conservation. For a Boussinesq (incompressible) fluid, the continuity equation is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} = 0 $$\nWe integrate this equation vertically across the Ekman layer, from $z=-h_E$ to $z=0$:\n$$ \\int_{-h_E}^{0} \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} \\right) dz + \\int_{-h_E}^{0} \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} dz = 0 $$\nAssuming the layer thickness $h_E$ is constant, we can interchange the order of integration and horizontal differentiation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left( \\int_{-h_E}^{0} u \\, dz \\right) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\left( \\int_{-h_E}^{0} v \\, dz \\right) + [w(z=0) - w(z=-h_E)] = 0 $$\nSubstituting the definitions of Ekman transports $U_E$ and $V_E$, this becomes:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial U_E}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial V_E}{\\partial y} + w(z=0) - w(z=-h_E) = 0 $$\nThe problem states a kinematic boundary condition of no normal flow at the surface, so $w(z=0) = 0$. The vertical velocity at the base of the Ekman layer is defined as $w_E \\equiv w(z=-h_E)$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$ w_E = \\frac{\\partial U_E}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial V_E}{\\partial y} $$\nThis shows that the vertical velocity at the base of the Ekman layer is determined by the horizontal divergence of the Ekman transport. This vertical motion is known as Ekman pumping (if $w_E  0$) or Ekman suction (if $w_E > 0$).\n\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $U_E$ and $V_E$ in terms of the wind stress:\n$$ w_E = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{\\tau_y}{f\\rho}\\right) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(-\\frac{\\tau_x}{f\\rho}\\right) $$\nSince $\\rho$ and $f$ are given as constants, they can be factored out of the derivatives:\n$$ w_E = \\frac{1}{f\\rho} \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\tau_y}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial \\tau_x}{\\partial y}\\right) $$\nThe term in parentheses is the vertical component of the curl of the surface wind stress vector, $\\text{curl}_z(\\vec{\\tau}_s)$. Thus, the final expression for the Ekman velocity is:\n$$ w_E = \\frac{\\text{curl}_z(\\vec{\\tau}_s)}{\\rho f} $$\n\n### Numerical Calculation\n\nThe problem asks for the magnitude of $w_E$. Taking the absolute value of the derived expression:\n$$ |w_E| = \\left| \\frac{1}{\\rho f} \\left(\\frac{\\partial \\tau_y}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial \\tau_x}{\\partial y}\\right) \\right| = \\frac{|\\frac{\\partial \\tau_y}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial \\tau_x}{\\partial y}|}{|\\rho f|} $$\nThe given values are:\n- $|\\frac{\\partial \\tau_y}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial \\tau_x}{\\partial y}| = 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{N\\,m^{-3}}$\n- $\\rho = 1025\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$\n- $f = 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$\n\nSince $\\rho$ and $f$ are positive, $|\\rho f| = \\rho f$.

The right-hand side simplifies to the vertical component of the wind stress curl, $(\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{\\tau}^w)_z = \\frac{\\partial \\tau_y^w}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial \\tau_x^w}{\\partial y}$, divided by $\\rho_0$.\n\nThe left-hand side is expanded as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial(fU)}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial(fV)}{\\partial y} = f \\left( \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y} \\right) + U \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} + V \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\n$$\n\nThe depth-integrated continuity equation for an incompressible fluid is $\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial y} = 0$, so the first term vanishes. Using the beta-plane approximation, the Coriolis parameter $f$ is considered a function of latitude $y$ only, so $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 0$. The meridional gradient of $f$ is defined as the planetary vorticity gradient, $\\beta = \\frac{df}{dy}$. The problem provides the spherical coordinate form, $\\beta(\\phi) = \\frac{2\\Omega\\cos\\phi}{R}$, where $R$ is Earth's radius. The left side thus simplifies to $\\beta V$.\n\nCombining the simplified terms, we arrive at the Sverdrup relation:\n$$\n\\beta V = \\frac{1}{\\rho_0} (\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{\\tau}^w)_z\n$$\nThis equation states that the meridional transport per unit width, $V$, is directly proportional to the local vertical component of the wind stress curl. We can solve for $V$, which we identify as the meridional transport density:\n$$\nV(x, y) = \\frac{1}{\\rho_0 \\beta(y)} (\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{\\tau}^w)_z(x, y)\n$$\n\nTo find the total interior meridional transport across a latitude line, $M_y$, we must integrate $V$ zonally across the entire basin, from the eastern boundary ($x_E$) to the western boundary ($x_W$):\n$$\nM_y = \\int_{x_E}^{x_W} V(x) dx = \\int_{x_E}^{x_W} \\frac{1}{\\rho_0 \\beta} (\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{\\tau}^w)_z dx\n$$\nThe theory of wind-driven gyres posits that this broad, slow interior flow is returned in a narrow, fast-flowing western boundary current. For mass to be conserved, the transport of the western boundary current, $M_{WBC}$, must balance the interior transport: $M_y + M_{WBC} = 0$, which implies $|M_y| = |M_{WBC}|$. This problem tests this theoretical equivalence by comparing the magnitude of the calculated interior transport, $|M_y|$, with the measured transport of a western boundary current.\n\n**Numerical Computation**\n\nFor each test case at a fixed latitude $\\phi$:\n1.  The planetary vorticity gradient $\\beta = \\frac{2\\Omega\\cos\\phi}{R}$ is calculated. Note that $\\phi$ must be in radians for the cosine function. Since $-90^\\circ  \\phi  90^\\circ$, $\\cos\\phi > 0$, and thus $\\beta$ is always positive.\n2.  The integrand, the meridional transport density $V_i = \\frac{1}{\\rho_0 \\beta} (\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{\\tau})_i$, is computed for each longitude point $i$.\n3.  The zonal-coordinate positions, $x_i$, are calculated from the longitudes $\\lambda_i$ (in degrees) using a cylindrical projection at latitude $\\phi$: $x_i = R \\cos\\phi \\cdot (\\lambda_i \\cdot \\frac{\\pi}{180})$. This converts the angular positions to metric distances along the latitude line.\n4s. The total interior transport $M_y$ (in $\\mathrm{m}^3/\\mathrm{s}$) is computed by numerically integrating $V(x)$ with respect to $x$ using the trapezoidal rule, `numpy.trapz(V, x)`, which operates on the discrete sets $\\{V_i\\}$ and $\\{x_i\\}$. The longitudes are provided from east to west, so the array of $x_i$ values will be monotonically decreasing. The `trapz` function correctly handles this.\n5.  The computed transport is converted from $\\mathrm{m}^3/\\mathrm{s}$ to Sverdrups (Sv) by dividing by $10^6$.\n6.  The final result is the absolute difference between the magnitude of this computed transport and the provided measured western boundary current transport, $| |M_{y, \\text{computed}}| - M_{WBC, \\text{measured}} |$, rounded to three decimal places.",
