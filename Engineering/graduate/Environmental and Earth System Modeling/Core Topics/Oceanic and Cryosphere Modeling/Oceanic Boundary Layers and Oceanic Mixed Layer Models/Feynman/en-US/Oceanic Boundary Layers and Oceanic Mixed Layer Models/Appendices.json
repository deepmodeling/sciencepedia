Neglects pressure gradients and advection.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem describes a slab model of the oceanic mixed layer, often called the Ekman slab model. This is a fundamental and well-established simplification in physical oceanography, directly derived from Newton's second law applied to a fluid parcel under wind, Coriolis, and frictional forces. It is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is an initial value problem for a system of two linear, first-order, non-homogeneous ODEs with constant coefficients. Given the initial conditions $u(0)=0$ and $v(0)=0$, a unique, stable, and meaningful solution is guaranteed to exist for all $t \\ge 0$.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise mathematical formalism and objective physical quantities. There is no ambiguity or subjective language.\n- All other validation criteria are met. The problem is not incomplete, contradictory, unrealistic, ill-posed, or trivial.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nThe governing equations can be simplified by dividing by the constant term $\\rho h$:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dt} - f v = \\frac{\\tau_x}{\\rho h} - r u \\\\\n\\frac{dv}{dt} + f u = \\frac{\\tau_y}{\\rho h} - r v\n$$\nRearranging terms, we get a standard system of linear ODEs:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dt} + r u - f v = \\frac{\\tau_x}{\\rho h} \\\\\n\\frac{dv}{dt} + f u + r v = \\frac{\\tau_y}{\\rho h}\n$$\nThis system can be elegantly solved by introducing a complex velocity $W(t) = u(t) + i v(t)$ and a complex forcing term $T = \\frac{\\tau_x}{\\rho h} + i \\frac{\\tau_y}{\\rho h}$. We multiply the second equation by $i$ and add it to the first:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{du}{dt} + i\\frac{dv}{dt}\\right) + (r u + i r v) + (i f u - f v) = \\frac{\\tau_x}{\\rho h} + i \\frac{\\tau_y}{\\rho h}\n$$\nRecognizing the terms: $\\frac{dW}{dt} = \\frac{du}{dt} + i\\frac{dv}{dt}$, $rW = r u + i r v$, and $i f W = i f(u+iv) = i f u - f v$. The equation simplifies to a single first-order linear ODE in the complex variable $W$:\n$$\n\\frac{dW}{dt} + (r+if)W = T\n$$\nThe initial conditions are $u(0)=0$ and $v(0)=0$, which implies $W(0) = 0$. This is a standard ODE of the form $y' + Py = Q$, where $P = r+if$ and $Q = T$ are constants. The solution is found using an integrating factor $\\mu(t) = e^{\\int P dt} = e^{(r+if)t}$. The general solution is:\n$$\nW(t) = \\frac{Q}{P} + C e^{-Pt}\n$$\nUsing the initial condition $W(0)=0$, we find the constant of integration $C$:\n$$\nW(0) = 0 = \\frac{T}{r+if} + C \\implies C = -\\frac{T}{r+if}\n$$\nThus, the specific solution for $W(t)$ is:\n$$\nW(t) = \\frac{T}{r+if} \\left(1 - e^{-(r+if)t}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the complete solution in complex form. To find $u(t)$ and $v(t)$, we must separate this expression into its real and imaginary parts.\n\nLet's define the complex steady-state velocity $W_\\infty$ as the velocity as $t \\to \\infty$ (assuming $r>0$):\n$$\nW_\\infty = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} W(t) = \\frac{T}{r+if}\n$$\nLet's\nexpress $W_\\infty$ in terms of its real and imaginary parts, $W_\\infty = U_\\infty + iV_\\infty$.\n$$\nW_\\infty = \\frac{\\frac{1}{\\rho h}(\\tau_x + i\\tau_y)}{r+if} = \\frac{\\tau_x + i\\tau_y}{\\rho h} \\frac{r-if}{r^2+f^2} = \\frac{(r\\tau_x+f\\tau_y) + i(r\\tau_y-f\\tau_x)}{\\rho h (r^2+f^2)}\n$$\nFrom this, we identify the real and imaginary components of the steady-state solution:\n$$\nU_\\infty = \\frac{r\\tau_x + f\\tau_y}{\\rho h (r^2+f^2)}\n$$\n$$\nV_\\infty = \\frac{r\\tau_y - f\\tau_x}{\\rho h (r^2+f^2)}\n$$\nNow, substitute $W_\\infty$ back into the time-dependent solution for $W(t)$:\n$$\nW(t) = W_\\infty \\left(1 - e^{-rt}e^{-ift}\\right)\n$$\nUsing Euler's formula, $e^{-ift} = \\cos(ft) - i\\sin(ft)$, we expand the expression:\n$$\nW(t) = (U_\\infty + iV_\\infty) \\left(1 - e^{-rt}(\\cos(ft) - i\\sin(ft))\\right)\n$$\n$$\nW(t) = (U_\\infty + iV_\\infty) \\left( (1 - e^{-rt}\\cos(ft)) + i(e^{-rt}\\sin(ft)) \\right)\n$$\nTo find $u(t) = \\text{Re}[W(t)]$ and $v(t) = \\text{Im}[W(t)]$, we multiply the complex numbers:\n$$\nu(t) = U_\\infty(1 - e^{-rt}\\cos(ft)) - V_\\infty(e^{-rt}\\sin(ft))\n$$\n$$\nv(t) = V_\\infty(1 - e^{-rt}\\cos(ft)) + U_\\infty(e^{-rt}\\sin(ft))\n$$\nThese expressions can be rearranged to highlight the structure of the solution, which is a steady-state component and a transient, decaying inertial oscillation:\n$$\nu(t) = U_\\infty - e^{-rt} (U_\\infty \\cos(ft) + V_\\infty \\sin(ft))\n$$\n$$\nv(t) = V_\\infty - e^{-rt} (V_\\infty \\cos(ft) - U_\\infty \\sin(ft))\n$$\nThese are the final, explicit mathematical expressions for the velocity components $u(t)$ and $v(t)$. Note that these formulas are valid for all given test cases, including the case where $r=0$ (provided $f \\neq 0$, which is true for all cases).\n\n**Algorithm Design**\nThe algorithm to compute $(u(t), v(t))$ is a direct implementation of the derived formulas:\n1.  For a given set of parameters $(\\rho, h, f, r, \\tau_x, \\tau_y, t)$:\n2.  Calculate the denominator term $D = \\rho h (r^2 + f^2)$. This term is non-zero for all test cases.\n3.  Calculate the steady-state velocity components $U_\\infty$ and $V_\\infty$:\n    - $U_\\infty = (r\\tau_x + f\\tau_y) / D$\n    - $V_\\infty = (r\\tau_y - f\\tau_x) / D$\n4.  Calculate the time-dependent terms:\n    - Exponential decay: $E = e^{-rt}$\n    - Oscillatory terms: $C_f = \\cos(ft)$, $S_f = \\sin(ft)$\n5.  Combine these to find the final velocities $u(t)$ and $v(t)$:\n    - $u(t) = U_\\infty - E (U_\\infty C_f + V_\\infty S_f)$\n    - $v(t) = V_\\infty - E (V_\\infty C_f - U_\\infty S_f)$\n6.  Round the calculated $u(t)$ and $v(t)$ to $6$ decimal places as required.\n\nThis algorithm will be implemented in Python for each of the test cases provided.",

Using this definition and starting from first principles appropriate to bulk mixed-layer energetics (the vertically integrated TKE budget and the work required to lift denser fluid across a buoyancy jump), derive an expression for the entrainment velocity $w_e$ in terms of $Ri_f$, $P_A$, $B_A$, $h$, $\\rho_0$, and $\\Delta b$.\n\nThen, under mixed forcing, evaluate $w_e$ for the following scientifically realistic parameters:\n- Reference density $\\rho_0 = 1025\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$,\n- Mixed-layer depth $h = 50\\,\\mathrm{m}$,\n- Buoyancy jump at the base $\\Delta b = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}$,\n- Depth-integrated mechanical TKE production $P_A = 1.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$,\n- Depth-integrated buoyancy TKE production $B_A = 1.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$,\n- Bulk flux Richardson number $Ri_f = 0.20$.\n\nRound your final numerical answer for $w_e$ to three significant figures and express it in $\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the entrainment velocity $w_e$ based on the energetic principles of an oceanic mixed layer, followed by a numerical calculation.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for $w_e$. The problem defines the bulk flux Richardson number $Ri_f$ as the ratio of the rate of increase of mixed-layer potential energy due to entrainment ($E_{PE}$) to the total TKE production per unit area ($P_A + B_A$).\n$$\nRi_f = \\frac{E_{PE}}{P_A + B_A}\n$$\nTo use this, we must first derive an expression for $E_{PE}$ from first principles. $E_{PE}$ is the rate of work done per unit area to increase the potential energy of the water column by entraining denser fluid from below.\n\nConsider a mixed layer of depth $h$ and density $\\rho_m$ overlying a denser layer with density $\\rho_b = \\rho_m + \\Delta\\rho$. The potential energy per unit area, $PE_A$, is $\\int \\rho(z) g z \\, dz$. When the mixed layer deepens by an infinitesimal amount $dh$, the change in potential energy, $d(PE_A)$, is the work required to lift the entrained mass and mix it into the layer. A rigorous derivation shows this change is:\n$$\nd(PE_A) = \\frac{1}{2} g (\\rho_b - \\rho_m) h \\, dh = \\frac{1}{2} g \\Delta\\rho h \\, dh\n$$\nThe rate of change of potential energy per unit area, $E_{PE}$, is found by dividing by the time interval $dt$. Given that the entrainment velocity is $w_e = dh/dt$:\n$$\nE_{PE} = \\frac{d(PE_A)}{dt} = \\frac{1}{2} g \\Delta\\rho h w_e\n$$\nThe problem uses the buoyancy jump $\\Delta b$. Buoyancy is defined as $b = -g(\\rho-\\rho_0)/\\rho_0$, so the jump is $\\Delta b = b_{m} - b_{b} = -g(\\rho_m - \\rho_b)/\\rho_0 = g\\Delta\\rho/\\rho_0$. Therefore, we can write $g\\Delta\\rho = \\rho_0 \\Delta b$. Substituting this into the expression for $E_{PE}$ gives:\n$$\nE_{PE} = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho_0 \\Delta b h w_e\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $E_{PE}$ into the rearranged definition of $Ri_f$: $E_{PE} = Ri_f (P_A + B_A)$.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} \\rho_0 \\Delta b h w_e = Ri_f (P_A + B_A)\n$$\nSolving for the entrainment velocity $w_e$ yields the desired expression:\n$$\nw_e = \\frac{2 Ri_f (P_A + B_A)}{\\rho_0 \\Delta b h}\n$$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nNext, we evaluate $w_e$ using the provided parameters:\n- $Ri_f = 0.20$\n- $P_A = 1.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$\n- $B_A = 1.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$\n- $\\rho_0 = 1025\\,\\mathrm{kg\\,m^{-3}}$\n- $\\Delta b = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-2}}$\n- $h = 50\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n\nFirst, calculate the total TKE production per unit area:\n$$\nP_A + B_A = 1.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}} + 1.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}} = 3.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}\n$$\nSubstitute all values into the expression for $w_e$.
