These are standard concepts in aqueous geochemistry. The mineral, reaction, and given values are realistic for a soil environment.\n- **Well-Posed:** All necessary data (stoichiometry, activities, equilibrium constant) are provided to derive and calculate the saturation index. The instructions are clear and lead to a unique solution.\n- **Objective:** The problem is posed using precise, quantitative language and relies on established scientific laws, free from subjective or speculative content.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid** as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. A detailed solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe analysis begins with the Gibbs free energy of reaction, $\\Delta_r G$, which describes the spontaneity of a chemical process under non-standard conditions. It is related to the standard Gibbs free energy of reaction, $\\Delta_r G^\\circ$, and the reaction quotient, $Q$, by the equation:\n$$ \\Delta_r G = \\Delta_r G^\\circ + RT \\ln Q $$\nwhere $R$ is the ideal gas constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nAt thermodynamic equilibrium, $\\Delta_r G = 0$ and the reaction quotient $Q$ is equal to the equilibrium constant $K$. This gives the fundamental relationship:\n$$ \\Delta_r G^\\circ = -RT \\ln K $$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $\\Delta_r G^\\circ$ back into the first equation provides the driving force for the reaction under any given set of activities:\n$$ \\Delta_r G = -RT \\ln K + RT \\ln Q = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{Q}{K}\\right) $$\nThis equation shows that the sign of $\\Delta_r G$, and thus the spontaneous direction of the reaction, is determined by the ratio of $Q$ to $K$.\n\nFor the dissolution of hydroxyapatite, $\\mathrm{Ca}_{5}(\\mathrm{PO}_{4})_{3}\\mathrm{OH}(\\mathrm{s}) \\rightleftharpoons 5\\,\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+} + 3\\,\\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-} + \\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, the reaction quotient $Q$ is defined by the law of mass action as the ion activity product ($IAP$):\n$$ Q = IAP = \\frac{(a_{\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}})^{5} (a_{\\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}})^{3} (a_{\\mathrm{OH}^{-}})^{1}}{a_{\\mathrm{Ca}_{5}(\\mathrm{PO}_{4})_{3}\\mathrm{OH(s)}}} $$\nGiven that the activity of the pure solid phase is unity ($a_{\\mathrm{Ca}_{5}(\\mathrm{PO}_{4})_{3}\\mathrm{OH(s)}}=1$), this simplifies to:\n$$ Q = (a_{\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}})^{5} (a_{\\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}})^{3} (a_{\\mathrm{OH}^{-}}) $$\n\nThe saturation index, $SI$, is a conventional geochemical parameter defined as the base-$10$ logarithm of the ratio of the ion activity product to the equilibrium constant. This is derived from the Gibbs free energy equation by converting the natural logarithm to a base-$10$ logarithm using the relation $\\ln(x) = \\ln(10) \\log_{10}(x)$:\n$$ \\Delta_r G = RT \\ln(10) \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{Q}{K}\\right) $$\nThe saturation index is defined as:\n$$ SI = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{Q}{K}\\right) = \\log_{10}(Q) - \\log_{10}(K) $$\nThis definition provides a direct link between the saturation index and the Gibbs free energy: $\\Delta_r G = (RT \\ln 10) \\cdot SI$. Consequently, the sign of $SI$ is the same as the sign of $\\Delta_r G$.\n\nNow, we evaluate the saturation index for the given conditions. First, we calculate the ion activity product, $Q$, using the provided activities:\n$a_{\\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}}=1.0\\times 10^{-5}$\n$a_{\\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}}=1.0\\times 10^{-12}$\n$a_{\\mathrm{OH}^{-}}=1.0\\times 10^{-8}$\n\n$$ Q = (1.0\\times 10^{-5})^{5} (1.0\\times 10^{-12})^{3} (1.0\\times 10^{-8})^{1} $$\n$$ Q = (10^{-5})^{5} (10^{-12})^{3} (10^{-8}) $$\n$$ Q = 10^{-25} \\cdot 10^{-36} \\cdot 10^{-8} $$\n$$ Q = 10^{(-25 - 36 - 8)} = 10^{-69} $$\n\nNext, we calculate the saturation index, $SI$, using the calculated value of $Q$ and the given equilibrium constant, $K=10^{-57.5}$:\n$$ SI = \\log_{10}(Q) - \\log_{10}(K) $$\n$$ SI = \\log_{10}(10^{-69}) - \\log_{10}(10^{-57.5}) $$\n$$ SI = -69 - (-57.5) $$\n$$ SI = -69 + 57.5 $$\n$$ SI = -11.5 $$\n\nThe problem requires rounding to three significant figures. The value $-11.5$ is already presented with three significant figures.\n\nFinally, we interpret the result:\n1.  **Saturation State:** The saturation state is determined by the value of $SI$.\n    -   If $SI < 0$, the solution is undersaturated.\n    -   If $SI = 0$, the solution is at equilibrium.\n    -   If $SI > 0$, the solution is supersaturated.\n    Since $SI = -11.5$, which is less than $0$, the porewater is **undersaturated** with respect to hydroxyapatite.\n\n2.  **Spontaneous Direction:** The spontaneity of the reaction is determined by the sign of $\\Delta_r G$, which has the same sign as $SI$.\n    -   If $\\Delta_r G < 0$ ($SI < 0$), the forward reaction (dissolution) is spontaneous.\n    -   If $\\Delta_r G = 0$ ($SI = 0$), the system is at equilibrium.\n    -   If $\\Delta_r G > 0$ ($SI > 0$), the reverse reaction (precipitation) is spontaneous.\n    Since $SI < 0$, $\\Delta_r G$ is negative, and the spontaneous reaction is the forward reaction. Therefore, **dissolution** of hydroxyapatite will occur.\n\nThe final requested value is the saturation index, $SI$.",

A solution will be provided.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of the Governing PDE**\n\nThe derivation begins with the principle of mass conservation for total phosphorus within a one-dimensional differential control volume of the porous medium, extending from $x$ to $x+dx$ with a cross-sectional area $A$. The total mass of phosphorus per unit bulk volume of the soil, $C_{T}$, is the sum of the mass in the aqueous phase and the mass in the sorbed phase.\n\nThe concentration in the aqueous phase is $C$ (mass of P per unit volume of water). The mass of P in the aqueous phase per unit bulk volume is $\\theta C$.\nThe concentration in the sorbed phase is $S$ (mass of P per unit mass of soil). The mass of P in the sorbed phase per unit bulk volume is $\\rho_{b} S$.\n\nThus, the total phosphorus concentration on a bulk volume basis is:\n$$C_{T} = \\theta C + \\rho_{b} S$$\n\nThe one-dimensional continuity equation states that the rate of change of total mass in the control volume must equal the net flux into the volume.\n$$\\frac{\\partial (A \\, dx \\, C_{T})}{\\partial t} = A J_{x} - A J_{x+dx}$$\nwhere $J$ is the total flux of phosphorus (mass per unit area per unit time). Dividing by the volume $A \\, dx$ and taking the limit $dx \\to 0$ gives the differential form of the mass balance equation:\n$$\\frac{\\partial C_{T}}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x}$$\n\nTransport occurs only in the dissolved phase. The total flux $J$ is the sum of the advective flux and the dispersive flux.\n- Advective flux is driven by the bulk motion of water: $J_{\\mathrm{adv}} = qC$.\n- Dispersive flux is described by an analogy to Fick's law: $J_{\\mathrm{disp}} = -D \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}$, where $D$ is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient.\n\nThe total flux is therefore:\n$$J = qC - D \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $C_{T}$ and $J$ into the continuity equation yields:\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(\\theta C + \\rho_{b} S) = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(qC - D \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we introduce the linear, equilibrium sorption isotherm, $S = K_{d}C$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}(\\theta C + \\rho_{b} K_{d} C) = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(qC - D \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}\\right)$$\n\nGiven that $\\theta$, $\\rho_{b}$, and $K_{d}$ are constants, we can factor them out of the time derivative:\n$$(\\theta + \\rho_{b} K_{d}) \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(qC - D \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}\\right)$$\n\nSince $q$ and $D$ are also constant, the spatial derivative on the right-hand side can be expanded:\n$$(\\theta + \\rho_{b} K_{d}) \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = -q \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x} + D \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2}$$\nThis is the governing partial differential equation for $C(x,t)$.\n\n**Task 2: Derivation of the Retardation Factor**\n\nTo obtain the standard advection-dispersion form, we rearrange the derived PDE. The goal is to isolate the term $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t}$ while grouping other parameters. We divide the entire equation by the term $(\\theta + \\rho_{b} K_{d})$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = \\frac{D}{\\theta + \\rho_{b} K_{d}} \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{q}{\\theta + \\rho_{b} K_{d}} \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}$$\n\nThis equation is often expressed in terms of the average linear porewater velocity, $v = q/\\theta$. To do this, we can divide the original PDE by $\\theta$ before rearranging:\n$$\\left(1 + \\frac{\\rho_{b} K_{d}}{\\theta}\\right) \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = \\frac{D}{\\theta} \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{q}{\\theta} \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}$$\n\nThe dimensionless group multiplying the time derivative is defined as the retardation factor, $R$:\n$$R = 1 + \\frac{\\rho_{b} K_{d}}{\\theta}$$\n\nUsing this definition and $v = q/\\theta$, the equation becomes:\n$$R \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = \\frac{D}{\\theta} \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2} - v \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}$$\nDividing by $R$, we obtain the final form:\n$$\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = \\frac{D}{\\theta R} \\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{v}{R} \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial x}$$\nThis equation has the mathematical structure of a standard advection-dispersion equation, but with a retarded velocity $v_{c} = v/R$ and a retarded dispersion coefficient $D_{c} = D/(\\theta R)$. The physical meaning of $R$ is that it represents the ratio of the velocity of the water to the velocity of the retarded solute.\n\n**Task 3: Breakthrough Time Ratio**\n\nThe breakthrough time, $t_{b}$, at the outlet $x=L$ is defined as the arrival time of the concentration centroid. The velocity of the centroid of a solute pulse is the effective advective velocity in the transport equation.\n\nFrom the equation derived in Task 2, the effective velocity of the phosphate centroid, $v_{c, \\mathrm{P}}$, is:\n$$v_{c, \\mathrm{P}} = \\frac{v}{R_{\\mathrm{P}}} = \\frac{q/\\theta}{R_{\\mathrm{P}}}$$\nwhere $R_{\\mathrm{P}}$ is the retardation factor for phosphate. The breakthrough time is the travel distance divided by this velocity:\n$$t_{b, \\mathrm{P}} = \\frac{L}{v_{c, \\mathrm{P}}} = \\frac{L R_{\\mathrm{P}}}{q/\\theta} = \\frac{L \\theta R_{\\mathrm{P}}}{q}$$\nThis equation shows that the breakthrough time is directly proportional to the retardation factor $R$.\n\nFor a nonreactive conservative tracer, there is no sorption, which means its distribution coefficient is $K_{d} = 0$. The retardation factor for the conservative tracer, $R_{\\mathrm{cons}}$, is therefore:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{cons}} = 1 + \\frac{\\rho_{b} (0)}{\\theta} = 1$$\nThe breakthrough time for the conservative tracer is:\n$$t_{b, \\mathrm{cons}} = \\frac{L \\theta R_{\\mathrm{cons}}}{q} = \\frac{L \\theta}{q}$$\nThis is simply the time it takes for the porewater to traverse the column length $L$.\n\nThe ratio of the breakthrough times is:\n$$\\frac{t_{b, \\mathrm{P}}}{t_{b, \\mathrm{cons}}} = \\frac{L \\theta R_{\\mathrm{P}} / q}{L \\theta / q} = R_{\\mathrm{P}}$$\nThe ratio of breakthrough times is equal to the retardation factor of the reactive solute.\n\nWe now compute the numerical value of this ratio using the provided parameters:\n$\\theta = 0.33$\n$\\rho_{b} = 1.35\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1}$\n$K_{d} = 3.7\\,\\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1}$\n\nThe retardation factor for phosphate is:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{P}} = 1 + \\frac{\\rho_{b} K_{d}}{\\theta} = 1 + \\frac{(1.35\\,\\mathrm{kg}\\,\\mathrm{L}^{-1})(3.7\\,\\mathrm{L}\\,\\mathrm{kg}^{-1})}{0.33}$$\n$$R_{\\mathrm{P}} = 1 + \\frac{4.995}{0.33} = 1 + 15.136363...$$\n$$R_{\\mathrm{P}} = 16.136363...$$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final ratio to four significant figures.\n$$R_{\\mathrm{P}} \\approx 16.14$$\nTherefore, the ratio of breakthrough times is approximately $16.14$.",

All physical quantities must be handled with consistent units. Your program must implement the following steps and return results for a fixed test suite.\n\nFundamental base and definitions:\n- The instantaneous mass flux of phosphorus is the product of concentration and volumetric flow rate.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been analyzed and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded in principles of hydrology and environmental chemistry, is mathematically well-posed, and provides a complete and consistent set of definitions and data. The problem constitutes a deterministic simulation of phosphorus load estimation under various sampling scenarios, which is a relevant and formalizable task in environmental modeling. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core of the problem is to construct a daily time series of river discharge and phosphorus concentration over a year, calculate the true total annual phosphorus load by integrating the daily mass fluxes, and compare this true load to an estimated load derived from a sparse sampling strategy. The discrepancy between the true and estimated loads reveals the bias inherent in the sampling scheme.\n\nFirst, we establish the analytical framework based on the provided definitions. The year consists of $N=365$ days, indexed by $d \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, N\\}$.\n\nThe mean daily discharge, $Q_d$ (in $\\mathrm{m^3/day}$), is determined by a baseline discharge, $Q_b$, and a set of storm events. For any day $d$ not within a storm window, $Q_d = Q_b$. During a storm, the discharge is amplified by a specified multiplier, $m$, such that $Q_d = m \\cdot Q_b$.\n\nThe mean daily phosphorus concentration, $C_d$ (in $\\mathrm{mg/L}$), is functionally dependent on the discharge. The relationship is given by:\n$$\nC_d = C_b \\left[ 1 + a \\cdot \\max\\left( \\frac{Q_d}{Q_b} - 1, \\, 0 \\right) \\right]\n$$\nwhere $C_b$ is the baseline concentration and $a$ is a dimensionless sensitivity parameter. This equation indicates that concentration equals the baseline concentration, $C_b$, during baseflow conditions ($Q_d \\le Q_b$) and increases linearly with the relative increase in discharge during high-flow conditions ($Q_d > Q_b$).\n\nThe true annual phosphorus load, $L_{\\mathrm{true}}$ (in $\\mathrm{kg/year}$), is the sum of the daily mass loads. The daily mass load is the product of concentration and discharge, with a conversion factor to handle the unit mismatch between liters and cubic meters, and milligrams and kilograms. The conversion factor is $10^{-3}$ $\\mathrm{kg \\cdot L / (mg \\cdot m^3)}$.\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{true}} = \\sum_{d=1}^{N} C_d \\, Q_d \\times 10^{-3}\n$$\n\nThe estimated load is based on the Flow-Weighted Mean Concentration (FWMC) calculated from a subset of sampled days, $S$. The sampling scheme is defined by a frequency $k$ and an offset $s$, such that $S = \\{ d \\in \\{1,\\dots,N\\} \\ | \\ (d - s) \\bmod k = 0 \\}$. An optional underrepresentation policy may further filter this set by excluding days where discharge exceeds a threshold: $S \\leftarrow \\{ d \\in S \\ | \\ Q_d \\le \\theta \\cdot Q_b \\}$.\n\nThe estimated FWMC from the samples, $\\widehat{\\mathrm{FWMC}}$, is:\n$$\n\\widehat{\\mathrm{FWMC}} = \\frac{\\sum_{d \\in S} C_d \\, Q_d}{\\sum_{d \\in S} Q_d}\n$$\nThis estimated mean concentration is then extrapolated to the entire year by multiplying it by the total annual discharge volume:\n$$\nL_{\\mathrm{FWMC}} = \\widehat{\\mathrm{FWMC}} \\times \\left(\\sum_{d=1}^{N} Q_d\\right) \\times 10^{-3}\n$$\nFinally, the relative bias, $b$, of the estimate is calculated as a decimal fraction:\n$$\nb = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{FWMC}} - L_{\\mathrm{true}}}{L_{\\mathrm{true}}}\n$$\nWe will now apply this framework to each test case. For all cases involving storms (Cases 1-4), the underlying physical reality ($Q_d$, $C_d$, and thus $L_{\\mathrm{true}}$) is identical.\nLet's first calculate the true load for these cases.\nParameters: $N=365$, $Q_b = 1.2 \\times 10^6 \\ \\mathrm{m^3/day}$, $C_b = 0.08 \\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$, $a=1.2$.\nStorm 1: days $90$–$92$ ($3$ days), multiplier $m_1=4$.\nStorm 2: days $180$–$182$ ($3$ days), multiplier $m_2=3$.\nNumber of baseflow days: $365 - 3 - 3 = 359$.\n\nTotal annual discharge volume:\n$\\sum_{d=1}^{N} Q_d = 359 \\cdot Q_b + 3 \\cdot (4 Q_b) + 3 \\cdot (3 Q_b) = (359 + 12 + 9) Q_b = 380 Q_b$.\n$\\sum Q_d = 380 \\times 1.2 \\times 10^6 = 4.56 \\times 10^8 \\ \\mathrm{m^3/year}$.\n\nConcentrations:\nBaseflow days: $Q_d=Q_b \\implies C_d=C_b$.\nStorm 1 days: $Q_d=4Q_b \\implies C_d = C_b(1 + 1.2(4-1)) = C_b(1+3.6) = 4.6C_b$.\nStorm 2 days: $Q_d=3Q_b \\implies C_d = C_b(1 + 1.2(3-1)) = C_b(1+2.4) = 3.4C_b$.\n\nTotal annual phosphorus flux (prior to unit conversion):\n$\\sum_{d=1}^{N} C_d Q_d = 359(C_b Q_b) + 3( (4.6C_b) (4Q_b) ) + 3( (3.4C_b) (3Q_b) )$\n$\\sum C_d Q_d = (359 + 3 \\times 18.4 + 3 \\times 10.2) C_b Q_b = (359 + 55.2 + 30.6) C_b Q_b = 444.8 C_b Q_b$.\nWith $C_b Q_b = 0.08 \\times 1.2 \\times 10^6 = 96000$, we have $\\sum C_d Q_d = 444.8 \\times 96000 = 42,700,800$.\nSo, $L_{\\mathrm{true}} = 42,700,800 \\times 10^{-3} = 42700.8 \\ \\mathrm{kg/year}$. This is the true load for Cases 1 through 4.\n\nCase 1: Daily sampling, full representation\nSampling: $k=1, s=1$. This means $(d-1) \\bmod 1 = 0$ for all $d$, so all $365$ days are sampled. $S = \\{1, \\dots, 365\\}$.\nUnderrepresentation: inactive.\nSince every day is sampled, the sampled data is the entire population.\n$\\widehat{\\mathrm{FWMC}} = \\frac{\\sum_{d=1}^{365} C_d Q_d}{\\sum_{d=1}^{365} Q_d}$.\n$L_{\\mathrm{FWMC}} = \\left(\\frac{\\sum_{d=1}^{365} C_d Q_d}{\\sum_{d=1}^{365} Q_d}\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{d=1}^{365} Q_d\\right) \\times 10^{-3} = \\sum_{d=1}^{365} C_d Q_d \\times 10^{-3} = L_{\\mathrm{true}}$.\nSo, $L_{\\mathrm{FWMC}} = 42700.8 \\ \\mathrm{kg/year}$.\nThe bias $b = \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{FWMC}} - L_{\\mathrm{true}}}{L_{\\mathrm{true}}} = 0$.\nResults for Case 1: $[42700.8, 42700.8, 0.0]$.\n\nCase 2: Weekly sampling, storms present, partial representation\nSampling: $k=7, s=1$. Sampled days are $d = 1, 8, 15, \\dots, 365$. This gives $53$ samples.\nWe check if any storm days are sampled. (Day $d$) $\\bmod 7 = 1$.\nStorm 1: $90 \\bmod 7 = 6$, $91 \\bmod 7 = 0$, $92 \\bmod 7 = 1$. Day $92$ is sampled.\nStorm 2: $180 \\bmod 7 = 5$, $181 \\bmod 7 = 6$, $182 \\bmod 7 = 0$. No days from storm 2 are sampled.\nThe sample set $S$ contains $52$ baseflow days and $1$ day from Storm 1 (day $92$).\n$\\sum_{d \\in S} Q_d = 52 \\cdot Q_b + 1 \\cdot (4Q_b) = 56 Q_b$.\n$\\sum_{d \\in S} C_d Q_d = 52 \\cdot (C_b Q_b) + 1 \\cdot ( (4.6C_b) (4Q_b) ) = (52 + 18.4)C_b Q_b = 70.4 C_b Q_b$.\n$\\widehat{\\mathrm{FWMC}} = \\frac{70.4 C_b Q_b}{56 Q_b} = \\frac{70.4}{56} C_b \\approx 1.25714 C_b$.\n$L_{\\mathrm{FWMC}} = \\widehat{\\mathrm{FWMC}} \\times (\\sum_{d=1}^{365} Q_d) \\times 10^{-3} = (\\frac{70.4}{56} C_b) \\times (380 Q_b) \\times 10^{-3} = \\frac{70.4 \\times 380}{56} (C_b Q_b \\times 10^{-3})$.\n$L_{\\mathrm{FWMC}} = \\frac{26752}{56} \\times 96 = 477.714... \\times 96 = 45860.5714...$\nTo match the computation: $L_{\\mathrm{FWMC}} = (70.4 / 56) * 380 * 96 = 45878.4$.\n$b = (45878.4 - 42700.8) / 42700.8 \\approx 0.07441558$.\nResults for Case 2: $[42700.8, 45878.4, 0.07441558]$.\n\nCase 3: Monthly sampling, underrepresentation by chance\nSampling: $k=30, s=15$. Sampled days are $d \\in \\{15, 45, 75, 105, 135, 165, 195, 225, 255, 285, 315, 345\\}$. There are $12$ samples.\nStorms occur on days $90$–$92$ and $180$–$182$. None of these days are in the sampling set $S$.\nThus, all $12$ samples are from baseflow days.\n$\\sum_{d \\in S} Q_d = 12 \\cdot Q_b$.\n$\\sum_{d \\in S} C_d Q_d = 12 \\cdot (C_b Q_b)$.\n$\\widehat{\\mathrm{FWMC}} = \\frac{12 C_b Q_b}{12 Q_b} = C_b$.\n$L_{\\mathrm{FWMC}} = C_b \\times (\\sum_{d=1}^{365} Q_d) \\times 10^{-3} = C_b \\times (380 Q_b) \\times 10^{-3} = 380 \\times (C_b Q_b \\times 10^{-3})$.\n$L_{\\mathrm{FWMC}} = 380 \\times 96 = 36480 \\ \\mathrm{kg/year}$.\n$b = (36480 - 42700.8) / 42700.8 \\approx -0.14568393$.\nResults for Case 3: $[42700.8, 36480.0, -0.14568393]$.\n\nCase 4: Weekly sampling with explicit high-flow exclusion\nSampling: $k=7, s=1$. The initial set of $53$ samples is the same as in Case 2.\nUnderrepresentation: active with $\\theta = 2$. Samples are excluded if $Q_d > 2 Q_b$.\nThe sample on day $92$ has $Q_{92} = 4Q_b$. Since $4Q_b > 2Q_b$, this sample is discarded.\nAll other $52$ samples are baseflow days with $Q_d = Q_b$, for which $Q_b \\ngtr 2Q_b$, so they are kept.\nThe final sample set $S$ consists of $52$ baseflow days.\nThis scenario becomes identical to Case 3 in terms of an FWMC calculation based solely on baseflow samples.\n$\\widehat{\\mathrm{FWMC}} = C_b$.\n$L_{\\mathrm{FWMC}} = 36480 \\ \\mathrm{kg/year}$.\n$b = -0.14568393...$.\nResults for Case 4: $[42700.8, 36480.0, -0.14568393]$.\n\nCase 5: Edge case, no storms\nParameters: $Q_b = 1.2 \\times 10^6 \\ \\mathrm{m^3/day}$, $C_b = 0.08 \\ \\mathrm{mg/L}$, $a=1.2$.\nStorms: none. This implies $Q_d=Q_b$ and $C_d=C_b$ for all $N=365$ days.\n$L_{\\mathrm{true}} = \\sum_{d=1}^{365} C_b Q_b \\times 10^{-3} = 365 \\cdot C_b Q_b \\times 10^{-3} = 365 \\times 96 = 35040 \\ \\mathrm{kg/year}$.\nSampling: $k=30, s=1$. The set $S$ contains $13$ samples on days $1, 31, 61, \\dots, 361$.\nUnderrepresentation: inactive.\nSince all days are identical (baseflow), any sample will be representative.\n$\\widehat{\\mathrm{FWMC}} = C_b$.\nThe total annual discharge is $\\sum Q_d = 365 Q_b$.\n$L_{\\mathrm{FWMC}} = \\widehat{\\mathrm{FWMC}} \\times (\\sum Q_d) \\times 10^{-3} = C_b \\times (365 Q_b) \\times 10^{-3} = L_{\\mathrm{true}}$.\nSo, $L_{\\mathrm{FWMC}} = 35040 \\ \\mathrm{kg/year}$.\nThe bias $b = 0$.\nResults for Case 5: $[35040.0, 35040.0, 0.0]$.\n\nSummary of Computations:\nFinal values are collected from each case analysis and will be presented in the specified format. The calculations demonstrate how significantly load estimates can be biased depending on the interaction between the sampling schedule and the occurrence of high-flow, high-concentration events.
