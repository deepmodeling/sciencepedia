It is a standard, formalizable exercise in applying a biogeochemical model.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem asks for the derivation and evaluation of the realized specific growth rate of phytoplankton, denoted by $\\mu$.\n\nAccording to the provided basis (i), the realized specific growth rate is the product of the maximum potential specific growth rate, $\\mu_{\\max}$, and the dimensionless limitation factors for each resource. In this case, the limiting resources are nitrogen and light. Therefore, the governing equation is:\n$$ \\mu = \\mu_{\\max} \\cdot f_{N}(N) \\cdot f_{I}(I) $$\nwhere $f_{N}(N)$ is the nitrogen limitation factor and $f_{I}(I)$ is the light limitation factor.\n\nFirst, we calculate the nitrogen limitation factor, $f_{N}(N)$, using the provided Michaelis–Menten (Monod) function from basis (ii):\n$$ f_{N}(N) = \\frac{N}{K_{N}+N} $$\nThe problem provides the values $N=1$ and the half-saturation constant $K_{N}=0.5$. Substituting these values into the equation:\n$$ f_{N}(1) = \\frac{1}{0.5+1} = \\frac{1}{1.5} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{3}{2}} = \\frac{2}{3} $$\nSo, the nitrogen limitation factor is $f_{N} = \\frac{2}{3}$.\n\nNext, we identify the light limitation factor, $f_{I}(I)$. The problem statement provides this value directly:\n$$ f_{I}(I) = 0.6 = \\frac{6}{10} = \\frac{3}{5} $$\nSo, the light limitation factor is $f_{I} = \\frac{3}{5}$.\n\nThe problem requires an identification of the more limiting resource. The degree of limitation is inversely related to the value of the limitation factor; a smaller factor indicates stronger limitation. To compare the factors, we can express them with a common denominator or as decimals.\n$$ f_{N} = \\frac{2}{3} \\approx 0.667 $$\n$$ f_{I} = \\frac{3}{5} = 0.6 $$\nSince $0.6 < \\frac{2}{3}$, it follows that $f_{I} < f_{N}$. Therefore, light is the more limiting resource under these conditions.\n\nFinally, we calculate the realized specific growth rate, $\\mu$, by substituting the known values of $\\mu_{\\max}$, $f_{N}$, and $f_{I}$ into the governing equation. The maximum specific growth rate is given as $\\mu_{\\max}=1\\,\\mathrm{d^{-1}}$.\n$$ \\mu = \\mu_{\\max} \\cdot f_{N} \\cdot f_{I} $$\n$$ \\mu = 1 \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{3}{5} $$\nThe terms cancel, yielding:\n$$ \\mu = \\frac{2 \\cdot 3}{3 \\cdot 5} = \\frac{2}{5} $$\nThe resulting specific growth rate is $\\frac{2}{5}\\,\\mathrm{d^{-1}}$, or $0.4\\,\\mathrm{d^{-1}}$.

Let the state variables be dissolved inorganic nitrogen $N$, phytoplankton nitrogen $P$, zooplankton nitrogen $Z$, and detrital nitrogen $D$, each with units $\\mathrm{mmol\\,N\\,m^{-3}}$. Assume a closed nitrogen system with no external sources or sinks. The following processes operate, each represented as a first-principles mass balance consistent with nitrogen conservation:\n\n1. Phytoplankton specific growth transforms dissolved inorganic nitrogen into phytoplankton nitrogen at a realized specific rate $\\mu$ (units $\\mathrm{d^{-1}}$), producing a nitrogen transfer flux $U$ from $N$ to $P$. At any instant, $U$ is proportional to $P$.\n2.

A constant assimilation efficiency $0 \\le \\gamma \\le 1$ partitions grazed phytoplankton nitrogen: a fraction $\\gamma$ is assimilated to zooplankton, and the remainder $(1-\\gamma)$ is egested directly to detritus.\n4. Phytoplankton experience linear mortality at rate $m_{P}$ (units $\\mathrm{d^{-1}}$), sending nitrogen to detritus.

The state variables are dissolved inorganic nitrogen ($N$), phytoplankton nitrogen ($P$), zooplankton nitrogen ($Z$), and detrital nitrogen ($D$).\n\n1.  **Phytoplankton Uptake ($U$)**: This process transfers nitrogen from the dissolved inorganic pool $N$ to the phytoplankton pool $P$. The problem states it occurs at a realized specific rate $\\mu$ and the flux $U$ is proportional to the phytoplankton concentration $P$. This implies a source for $P$ and a sink for $N$. The flux is given by:\n    $$U = \\mu P$$\n\n2.  **Zooplankton Grazing ($G$)**: This process transfers nitrogen from the phytoplankton pool $P$.

The remaining fraction $(1-\\gamma)$ is egested as waste, becoming a source for the detritus pool $D$.\n    -   Flux to Zooplankton: $\\gamma G = \\gamma g P Z$\n    -   Flux to Detritus (egestion): $(1-\\gamma)G = (1-\\gamma) g P Z$\n\n4.  **Mortality**: Phytoplankton and zooplankton have linear mortality rates, $m_{P}$ and $m_{Z}$ respectively.

The residual is $V_{pred,2} - V_{obs,2} \\approx +0.0136\\,\\mathrm{d^{-1}}$.\n\nThe analysis shows that the two observations are not perfectly consistent with a single Monod curve, as they individually imply different values for $K_N$. However, the least-squares fitting procedure yields a single compromise value for $K_N$ that provides a reasonable fit to both data points. The model predictions are within $5.3\\%$ and $2.3\\%$ of their respective observed values. The small residuals suggest that the deviations could be attributed to typical experimental uncertainty, and thus the data can be considered reasonably consistent with the Monod model under the given condition for $V_{\\max}$.\n\nThe problem asks for the optimal value of $K_N$.\n$$K_N \\approx 1.25955...$$\nRounding to four significant figures yields $1.260$.",
