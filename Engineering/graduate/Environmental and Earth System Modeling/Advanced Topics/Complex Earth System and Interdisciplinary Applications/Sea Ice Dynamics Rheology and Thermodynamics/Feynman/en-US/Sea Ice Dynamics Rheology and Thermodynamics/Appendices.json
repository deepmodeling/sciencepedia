This practice uses dimensional analysis, a powerful tool in physics, to derive the characteristic timescale for heat to conduct through an ice slab. By comparing this intrinsic timescale to external forcing periods, such as the daily cycle, we can determine when it is appropriate to use a simplified quasi-steady thermal model versus a fully transient one .",

The surface of the ice is subjected to a diurnal atmospheric temperature oscillation of small amplitude and angular frequency $\\omega_d$, while the ice–ocean interface at the base is at a quasi-constant temperature over each day. Assume the vertical heat transport is governed by the one-dimensional Fourier heat equation with constant properties and no internal sources. Starting from the governing equation and the definition of thermal diffusivity, use dimensional analysis to identify an intrinsic conduction timescale across the slab and explain how it depends on $h$ and the material properties. Then, quantify when a quasi-steady vertical conduction assumption is valid by comparing this conduction timescale to the diurnal period $T_d$.\n\nUse the following thermophysical properties representative of sea ice: $k = 2.2 \\ \\mathrm{W \\ m^{-1} \\ K^{-1}}$, $\\rho = 917 \\ \\mathrm{kg \\ m^{-3}}$, and $c_p = 2100 \\ \\mathrm{J \\ kg^{-1} \\ K^{-1}}$.

In your reasoning, clarify the relationship between this threshold and the validity of a quasi-steady vertical conduction assumption for diurnal forcing.",
            "solution": "The vertical heat transport within the sea ice slab is governed by the one-dimensional Fourier heat equation. With the assumption of constant thermophysical properties and no internal heat sources, the equation is:\n$$ \\rho c_p \\frac{\\partial T(z, t)}{\\partial t} = k \\frac{\\partial^2 T(z, t)}{\\partial z^2} $$\nwhere $T$ is the temperature, $z$ is the vertical coordinate, $t$ is time, $\\rho$ is the density, $c_p$ is the specific heat capacity, and $k$ is the thermal conductivity of the sea ice.\n\nThis equation can be simplified by introducing the thermal diffusivity, $\\alpha$, which is defined as:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{k}{\\rho c_p} $$\nSubstituting this definition into the heat equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\partial^2 T}{\\partial z^2} $$\nThe thermal diffusivity $\\alpha$ has SI units of $\\mathrm{m^2 \\ s^{-1}}$. It represents the rate at which thermal disturbances propagate through a material.\n\nThe problem asks for an intrinsic conduction timescale, $\\tau_c$, across the slab of thickness $h$. We can determine this timescale using dimensional analysis. The relevant physical quantities are the slab thickness $h$ (dimension of length, $[L]$) and the thermal diffusivity $\\alpha$ (dimension of $[L]^2 [T]^{-1}$). We seek a combination of these that yields a quantity with the dimension of time, $[T]$. Let us propose that the timescale $\\tau_c$ is proportional to $h^a \\alpha^b$. The dimensional equation is:\n$$ [\\tau_c] = [h]^a [\\alpha]^b $$\n$$ [T]^1 = ([L]^a) ([L]^2 [T]^{-1})^b = [L]^{a+2b} [T]^{-b} $$\nTo ensure dimensional homogeneity, we must equate the exponents of each fundamental dimension on both sides of the equation:\nFor the time dimension $[T]$: $1 = -b \\implies b = -1$.\nFor the length dimension $[L]$: $0 = a + 2b \\implies a = -2b = -2(-1) = 2$.\n\nThus, the characteristic conduction timescale, $\\tau_c$, is proportional to $h^2 / \\alpha$. We define it as:\n$$ \\tau_c = \\frac{h^2}{\\alpha} = \\frac{\\rho c_p h^2}{k} $$\nThis expression shows that the time required for heat to diffuse across the slab increases quadratically with its thickness $h$. It is also directly proportional to the volumetric heat capacity, $\\rho c_p$, representing the thermal inertia of the material, and inversely proportional to the thermal conductivity, $k$, which governs the efficiency of heat transport.\n\nA quasi-steady vertical conduction assumption is valid when the system's internal temperature profile adjusts to changes in boundary conditions on a timescale much shorter than the timescale of the boundary condition changes themselves. In this problem, the boundary condition is the diurnal atmospheric temperature oscillation with period $T_d$. The internal adjustment timescale is the conduction timescale $\\tau_c$. Therefore, the quasi-steady assumption is valid when:\n$$ \\tau_c \\ll T_d $$\nUnder this condition ($h$ is small), the entire slab responds almost instantaneously to the surface temperature change, and the temperature profile at any moment can be approximated by the linear profile of a steady-state conduction problem. Conversely, if $\\tau_c \\gg T_d$ ($h$ is large), the thermal signal from the surface does not have time to penetrate the full depth of the ice before the forcing reverses. The base of the ice is effectively isolated from the diurnal surface fluctuations, and a transient, wave-like thermal response is confined to a near-surface layer.\n\nThe threshold thickness, $h^{\\star}$, separates these two regimes. It is defined as the thickness for which the intrinsic conduction timescale equals the diurnal period:\n$$ \\tau_c = T_d $$\n$$ \\frac{(h^{\\star})^2}{\\alpha} = T_d $$\nSolving for $h^{\\star}$, we get:\n$$ h^{\\star} = \\sqrt{\\alpha T_d} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k T_d}{\\rho c_p}} $$\nFor ice thickness $h \\ll h^{\\star}$, the quasi-steady assumption is valid for diurnal forcing. For $h \\gg h^{\\star}$, it is invalid.\n\nWe now compute the numerical value of $h^{\\star}$ using the provided thermophysical properties for sea ice and the diurnal period.\nGiven values:\n$k = 2.2 \\ \\mathrm{W \\ m^{-1} \\ K^{-1}}$\n$\\rho = 917 \\ \\mathrm{kg \\ m^{-3}}$\n$c_p = 2100 \\ \\mathrm{J \\ kg^{-1} \\ K^{-1}}$\n$T_d = 86400 \\ \\mathrm{s}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the thermal diffusivity $\\alpha$:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{k}{\\rho c_p} = \\frac{2.2 \\ \\mathrm{W \\ m^{-1} \\ K^{-1}}}{917 \\ \\mathrm{kg \\ m^{-3}} \\times 2100 \\ \\mathrm{J \\ kg^{-1} \\ K^{-1}}} \\approx 1.14296 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m^2 \\ s^{-1}} $$\nNext, we calculate the threshold thickness $h^{\\star}$:\n$$ h^{\\star} = \\sqrt{\\alpha T_d} = \\sqrt{(1.14296 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\mathrm{m^2 \\ s^{-1}}) \\times (86400 \\ \\mathrm{s})} $$\n$$ h^{\\star} = \\sqrt{0.0987497... \\ \\mathrm{m^2}} $$\n$$ h^{\\star} \\approx 0.3142446... \\ \\mathrm{m} $$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get:\n$$ h^{\\star} \\approx 0.314 \\ \\mathrm{m} $$\nThis means that for diurnal temperature variations, sea ice thinner than approximately $31.4 \\ \\mathrm{cm}$ can be reasonably modeled using a quasi-steady conduction assumption, while for thicker ice, transient effects become dominant and must be resolved.",
