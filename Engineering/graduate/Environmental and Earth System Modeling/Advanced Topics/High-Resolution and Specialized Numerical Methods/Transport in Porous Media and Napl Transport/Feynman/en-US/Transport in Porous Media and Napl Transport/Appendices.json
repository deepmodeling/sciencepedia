            "problem": "Consider a pore-scale scenario for transport of a Non-Aqueous Phase Liquid (NAPL) in a homogeneous, isotropic porous medium. Assume that the characteristic pore-throat diameter is $d$, the interfacial velocity scale is $U$, the dynamic viscosity of the NAPL is $\\mu$, the interfacial tension between NAPL and water is $\\sigma$, the density difference between the aqueous phase and NAPL is $\\Delta \\rho = \\rho_{\\text{water}} - \\rho_{\\text{NAPL}}$, the molecular diffusivity of the transported solute in the NAPL is $D_m$, and gravitational acceleration is $g$.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of fluid dynamics and mass transport, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and objective in its formulation. We can proceed with a solution.\n\nThe task is to derive the relevant dimensionless groups that govern the transport of a Non-Aqueous Phase Liquid (NAPL) at the pore scale and then evaluate these groups for a set of test cases. The derivation will be based on the nondimensionalization of the fundamental governing equations for mass and momentum conservation.\n\nThe characteristic scales given are the pore-throat diameter $d$ for length and the interfacial velocity scale $U$ for velocity. From these, we can define a characteristic time scale $t_{char} = d/U$.\n\nThe dimensionless variables are defined as follows:\n- Dimensionless position: $\\mathbf{x}^* = \\mathbf{x} / d$\n- Dimensionless velocity: $\\mathbf{u}^* = \\mathbf{u} / U$\n- Dimensionless time: $t^* = t / (d/U)$\n- Dimensionless concentration: $C^* = C / C_0$ (where $C_0$ is a reference concentration)\n- Dimensionless pressure: $p^* = p / P_{char}$ (where $P_{char}$ is a characteristic pressure to be determined)\n\n**1.

Derivation of the Capillary Number ($Ca$) and Bond Number ($Bo$)**\n\nThese numbers arise from the balance of forces at the interface between the NAPL and the surrounding aqueous phase. We consider the characteristic magnitudes of the viscous, capillary (interfacial tension), and buoyancy (gravity) forces acting on a fluid element of size $d$.\n\n- **Viscous force ($F_{visc}$):** Arises from the shear stress exerted by the flow.

This implicitly requires the use of a J-function definition that is independent of the contact angle, thereby normalizing out the effect of wettability. This interpretation makes the problem self-contained and uniquely solvable.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative terms, free of subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\nThe problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Capillary Pressure Functional Dependence\n\nMacroscopic capillary pressure, $p_c$, is defined as the pressure difference between the non-aqueous phase (NAPL) and the aqueous phase (water):\n$$\np_c = p_{NAPL} - p_{water}\n$$\nAt the microscopic level of a single pore, modelled as a capillary tube, this pressure difference is described by the Young-Laplace equation:\n$$\np_c = \\frac{2\\sigma}{r_{int}}\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma$ is the interfacial tension and $r_{int}$ is the radius of curvature of the meniscus between the two fluids. The radius of curvature is related to a representative pore radius, $r_p$, and the contact angle, $\\theta$, by the geometric relation:\n$$\nr_{int} = \\frac{r_p}{\\cos\\theta}\n$$\nThe contact angle $\\theta$ is specified as measured through the water phase. Substituting this into the Young-Laplace equation yields:\n$$\np_c = \\frac{2\\sigma\\cos\\theta}{r_p}\n$$\nThis equation describes the capillary pressure in a single pore. To upscale this to the macroscopic scale of the porous medium, we must relate the microscopic pore radius $r_p$ to a macroscopic property. The intrinsic permeability, $k$, which has units of area ($L^2$), provides a characteristic length scale for the pore space, $\\sqrt{k}$. We can thus postulate that the representative pore radius is proportional to this length scale, $r_p \\propto \\sqrt{k}$. The macroscopic capillary pressure then scales as:\n$$\np_c \\propto \\frac{\\sigma\\cos\\theta}{\\sqrt{k}}\n$$\nThe dependence on saturation, $S_w$, which reflects the distribution of pore sizes being filled at a given saturation, is captured by a dimensionless function, the Leverett J-function, $J(S_w)$. Incorporating this function as the dimensionless proportionality factor, we arrive at the functional relationship:\n$$\np_c(S_w) = J(S_w)\\frac{\\sigma\\cos\\theta}{\\sqrt{k}}\n$$\nThis formulation is consistent with the problem statement, as it defines a $J(S_w)$ that depends only on the pore geometry and saturation, not on fluid properties ($\\sigma$) or wettability ($\\theta$), explaining why its value is identical for both samples at the same $S_w$. The factor of $2$ from the simple capillary tube model is absorbed into the empirically determined $J(S_w)$ function.\n\n### Calculation of the Capillary Pressure Difference\n\nWe can now use the derived formula to calculate the capillary pressure for each sample.\n\nFor sample 1 (water-wet):\n- $\\theta_1 = 20^\\circ$\n- The capillary pressure $p_{c,1}$ is:\n$$\np_{c,1} = J(S_w)\\frac{\\sigma\\cos\\theta_1}{\\sqrt{k}}\n$$\nA positive value is expected since $\\theta_1 < 90^\\circ$, so $\\cos\\theta_1 > 0$. This indicates that $p_{NAPL} > p_{water}$, which is correct for a non-wetting fluid (NAPL) in a water-wet medium.\n\nFor sample 2 (NAPL-wet):\n- $\\theta_2 = 100^\\circ$\n- The capillary pressure $p_{c,2}$ is:\n$$\np_{c,2} = J(S_w)\\frac{\\sigma\\cos\\theta_2}{\\sqrt{k}}\n$$\nA negative value is expected since $\\theta_2 > 90^\\circ$, so $\\cos\\theta_2 < 0$. This indicates that $p_{NAPL} < p_{water}$, which is correct as the NAPL is now the wetting phase, and capillary forces will tend to draw it into the pores, meaning the water (now the non-wetting phase) must be at a higher pressure to maintain equilibrium.\n\nThe difference in capillary pressure, $\\Delta p_c$, is:\n$$\n\\Delta p_c = p_{c,1} - p_{c,2} = J(S_w)\\frac{\\sigma\\cos\\theta_1}{\\sqrt{k}} - J(S_w)\\frac{\\sigma\\cos\\theta_2}{\\sqrt{k}}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta p_c = J(S_w)\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{k}}(\\cos\\theta_1 - \\cos\\theta_2)\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n- $J(S_w) = 0.60$\n- $\\sigma = 0.035\\ \\text{N m}^{-1}$\n- $k = 1.0 \\times 10^{-12}\\ \\text{m}^2 \\implies \\sqrt{k} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{m}$\n- $\\theta_1 = 20^\\circ \\implies \\cos(20^\\circ) \\approx 0.9396926$\n- $\\theta_2 = 100^\\circ \\implies \\cos(100^\\circ) \\approx -0.1736482$\n$$\n\\Delta p_c = 0.60 \\times \\frac{0.035\\ \\text{N m}^{-1}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{m}} \\times (\\cos(20^\\circ) - \\cos(100^\\circ))\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta p_c = (0.60 \\times 35000\\ \\text{Pa}) \\times (0.9396926 - (-0.1736482))\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta p_c = 21000\\ \\text{Pa} \\times (1.1133408)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta p_c = 23380.1568\\ \\text{Pa}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in kilopascals (kPa), rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\Delta p_c = 23.3801568\\ \\text{kPa} \\approx 23.38\\ \\text{kPa}\n$$\n\n### Qualitative Interpretation\n\nThe sign of $\\Delta p_c$ is positive, meaning $p_{c,1} > p_{c,2}$.\n- $p_{c,1}$ is a large positive value ($p_{c,1} \\approx 19.73\\ \\text{kPa}$). This represents a significant capillary barrier that must be overcome by the NAPL pressure to displace water in the water-wet sample 1. High capillary resistance impedes the entry of the non-wetting phase (NAPL) into pores.\n- $p_{c,2}$ is a negative value ($p_{c,2} \\approx -3.65\\ \\text{kPa}$). This signifies that capillary forces are favorable to the NAPL entering the pores in the NAPL-wet sample 2. The NAPL, as the wetting phase, will spontaneously imbibe into the porous medium, effectively creating suction.\n\nRegarding displacement efficiency under an identical viscous drive (i.e., same applied pressure gradient):\n- In the water-wet system (sample 1), the applied pressure must overcome both viscous drag and the strong capillary resistance ($p_{c,1} > 0$). This leads to an inefficient displacement process. The NAPL tends to finger through the largest, lowest-resistance pathways, bypassing large volumes of water held by capillary forces in smaller pores. This results in a low displacement efficiency and high residual water saturation.\n- In the NAPL-wet system (sample 2), the capillary forces ($p_{c,2} < 0$) assist the displacement process. The spontaneous imbibition of NAPL helps it invade a wider range of pore sizes, leading to a more stable, piston-like displacement front. This results in a much higher displacement efficiency and lower residual water saturation for the same expenditure of viscous energy.\n\nThe large magnitude of $\\Delta p_c \\approx 23.38\\ \\text{kPa}$ quantifies the substantial difference in the capillary barrier between the two wettability states. It represents the additional pressure head required to invade the water-wet system with NAPL compared to the NAPL-wet system to reach the same water saturation $S_w$. This directly translates to a significantly lower displacement efficiency in the water-wet case.",
