A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\nThe areal mean of a spatially variable quantity $X(x, y)$ over a domain of area $A$ is given by the integral $\\overline{X} = \\frac{1}{A} \\iint_A X(x, y) \\,dx\\,dy$. For a domain partitioned into $N$ sub-domains (zones) $A_i$ where the quantity has a uniform value $X_i$, this integral simplifies to a weighted sum:\n$$ \\overline{X} = \\frac{1}{A} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i A_i $$\nIn this problem, the domain is partitioned into two zones of equal area, $A_1 = A/2$ and $A_2 = A/2$.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the lumped representation, $f(\\overline{\\theta})$. This requires calculating the areal-mean state variable, $\\overline{\\theta}$. Using the formula for the areal mean:\n$$ \\overline{\\theta} = \\frac{1}{A} (\\theta_1 A_1 + \\theta_2 A_2) $$\nSubstituting the given areas $A_1 = A/2$ and $A_2 = A/2$:\n$$ \\overline{\\theta} = \\frac{1}{A} \\left(\\theta_1 \\frac{A}{2} + \\theta_2 \\frac{A}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\theta_1 + \\theta_2) $$\nThe lumped representation is the function $f$ applied to this mean value:\n$$ f(\\overline{\\theta}) = (\\overline{\\theta})^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\theta_1 + \\theta_2}{2}\\right)^2 $$\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the distributed representation, $\\overline{f(\\theta)}$. This is the areal mean of the nonlinear function's output. In each zone, the function has a uniform value: $f(\\theta_1) = \\theta_1^2$ in zone $1$ and $f(\\theta_2) = \\theta_2^2$ in zone $2$. We compute the areal mean of these values:\n$$ \\overline{f(\\theta)} = \\frac{1}{A} \\left(f(\\theta_1) A_1 + f(\\theta_2) A_2\\right) $$\nSubstituting the areas and function definitions:\n$$ \\overline{f(\\theta)} = \\frac{1}{A} \\left(\\theta_1^2 \\frac{A}{2} + \\theta_2^2 \\frac{A}{2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\theta_1^2 + \\theta_2^2) $$\n\nNow, we can formulate the lumping-induced aggregation bias, $\\Delta$, using its definition:\n$$ \\Delta = \\overline{f(\\theta)} - f(\\overline{\\theta}) $$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for the distributed and lumped representations:\n$$ \\Delta = \\frac{1}{2}(\\theta_1^2 + \\theta_2^2) - \\left(\\frac{\\theta_1 + \\theta_2}{2}\\right)^2 $$\nWe expand the second term and simplify the expression:\n$$ \\Delta = \\frac{1}{2}(\\theta_1^2 + \\theta_2^2) - \\frac{1}{4}(\\theta_1^2 + 2\\theta_1\\theta_2 + \\theta_2^2) $$\nTo combine the terms, we find a common denominator of $4$:\n$$ \\Delta = \\frac{2}{4}(\\theta_1^2 + \\theta_2^2) - \\frac{1}{4}(\\theta_1^2 + 2\\theta_1\\theta_2 + \\theta_2^2) $$\n$$ \\Delta = \\frac{1}{4} (2\\theta_1^2 + 2\\theta_2^2 - \\theta_1^2 - 2\\theta_1\\theta_2 - \\theta_2^2) $$\n$$ \\Delta = \\frac{1}{4} (\\theta_1^2 - 2\\theta_1\\theta_2 + \\theta_2^2) $$\nThis expression is a perfect square trinomial:\n$$ \\Delta = \\frac{1}{4} (\\theta_1 - \\theta_2)^2 $$\nThis general result shows that for a convex function like $f(\\theta)=\\theta^2$, the aggregation bias $\\Delta$ is always non-negative, and is zero only if the field is uniform ($\\theta_1 = \\theta_2$).\n\nFinally, we evaluate $\\Delta$ for the given values $\\theta_1 = 0.2$ and $\\theta_2 = 0.6$:\n$$ \\Delta = \\frac{1}{4} (0.2 - 0.6)^2 $$\n$$ \\Delta = \\frac{1}{4} (-0.4)^2 $$\n$$ \\Delta = \\frac{1}{4} (0.16) $$\n$$ \\Delta = 0.04 $$\nThe lumping-induced aggregation bias is $0.04$.",

The runoff generation process, $q(f_c) = \\max(0, r-f_c)$, is a nonlinear and convex function of the infiltration capacity $f_c$. The distributed model calculates the average of the function's output, $\\langle q(f_c) \\rangle$, while the lumped model calculates the function of the average input, $q(\\langle f_c \\rangle)$.

To find the drawdown at the well, we integrate this equation from $r_w$ to $R$, noting that the transmissivity $T(r)$ is piecewise constant.\n$$s(R) - s(r_w) = \\int_{r_w}^{R} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}s}{\\mathrm{d}r} \\mathrm{d}r = -\\frac{Q}{2\\pi} \\int_{r_w}^{R} \\frac{1}{r T(r)} \\mathrm{d}r$$\nGiven the boundary condition $s(R)=0$, we have:\n$$s(r_w) = \\frac{Q}{2\\pi} \\int_{r_w}^{R} \\frac{1}{r T(r)} \\mathrm{d}r$$\nWe split the integral into the two annuli where $T(r)$ is constant:\n$$s_{\\text{true}}(r_w) = \\frac{Q}{2\\pi} \\left[ \\int_{r_w}^{a} \\frac{1}{r T_1} \\mathrm{d}r + \\int_{a}^{R} \\frac{1}{r T_2} \\mathrm{d}r \\right]$$\nEvaluating the integrals:\n$$s_{\\text{true}}(r_w) = \\frac{Q}{2\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{1}{T_1} [\\ln(r)]_{r_w}^{a} + \\frac{1}{T_2} [\\ln(r)]_{a}^{R} \\right]$$\n$$s_{\\text{true}}(r_w) = \\frac{Q}{2\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{1}{T_1} (\\ln(a) - \\ln(r_w)) + \\frac{1}{T_2} (\\ln(R) - \\ln(a)) \\right]$$\n$$s_{\\text{true}}(r_w) = \\frac{Q}{2\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{1}{T_1} \\ln\\left(\\frac{a}{r_w}\\right) + \\frac{1}{T_2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{a}\\right) \\right]$$\n\n### Derivation of the Lumped Model Drawdown, $s_{\\text{lump}}(r_{w})$\nFirst, we compute the specified lumped transmissivity, $T_A$, which is the areal arithmetic average.\nThe denominator integral is the total area of the annulus $[r_w, R]$ divided by $2\\pi$:\n$$\\int_{r_{w}}^{R} 2\\pi r\\,\\mathrm{d}r = 2\\pi \\left[\\frac{r^2}{2}\\right]_{r_w}^R = \\pi (R^2 - r_w^2)$$\nThe numerator integral is:\n$$\\int_{r_{w}}^{R} 2\\pi r\\,T(r)\\,\\mathrm{d}r = \\int_{r_{w}}^{a} 2\\pi r T_1\\,\\mathrm{d}r + \\int_{a}^{R} 2\\pi r T_2\\,\\mathrm{d}r$$\n$$= 2\\pi T_1 \\left[\\frac{r^2}{2}\\right]_{r_w}^a + 2\\pi T_2 \\left[\\frac{r^2}{2}\\right]_{a}^R$$\n$$= \\pi T_1 (a^2 - r_w^2) + \\pi T_2 (R^2 - a^2)$$\nThus, the lumped transmissivity is:\n$$T_A = \\frac{\\pi [T_1(a^2 - r_w^2) + T_2(R^2 - a^2)]}{\\pi(R^2 - r_w^2)} = \\frac{T_1(a^2 - r_w^2) + T_2(R^2 - a^2)}{R^2 - r_w^2}$$\nFor the lumped model, the aquifer is treated as homogeneous with transmissivity $T_A$. The governing equation for drawdown $s_{\\text{lump}}(r)$ is:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}s}{\\mathrm{d}r} = -\\frac{Q}{2\\pi r T_A}$$\nIntegrating from $r_w$ to $R$:\n$$s_{\\text{lump}}(R) - s_{\\text{lump}}(r_w) = \\int_{r_w}^{R} -\\frac{Q}{2\\pi r T_A} \\mathrm{d}r = -\\frac{Q}{2\\pi T_A} [\\ln(r)]_{r_w}^R$$\nWith $s_{\\text{lump}}(R)=0$:\n$$-s_{\\text{lump}}(r_w) = -\\frac{Q}{2\\pi T_A} (\\ln(R) - \\ln(r_w))$$\n$$s_{\\text{lump}}(r_w) = \\frac{Q}{2\\pi T_A} \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{r_w}\\right)$$\n\n### Derivation of the Bias Factor, $E$\nThe bias factor $E$ is the ratio of the true drawdown to the lumped model drawdown at the well.\n$$E = \\frac{s_{\\text{true}}(r_{w})}{s_{\\text{lump}}(r_{w})} = \\frac{\\frac{Q}{2\\pi} \\left[ \\frac{1}{T_1} \\ln\\left(\\frac{a}{r_w}\\right) + \\frac{1}{T_2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{a}\\right) \\right]}{\\frac{Q}{2\\pi T_A} \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{r_w}\\right)}$$\nThe factor $\\frac{Q}{2\\pi}$ cancels:\n$$E = T_A \\frac{\\frac{1}{T_1} \\ln\\left(\\frac{a}{r_w}\\right) + \\frac{1}{T_2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{a}\\right)}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{r_w}\\right)}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $T_A$:\n$$E = \\left( \\frac{T_1(a^2 - r_w^2) + T_2(R^2 - a^2)}{R^2 - r_w^2} \\right) \\left( \\frac{\\frac{1}{T_1} \\ln\\left(\\frac{a}{r_w}\\right) + \\frac{1}{T_2} \\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{a}\\right)}{\\ln\\left(\\frac{R}{r_w}\\right)} \\right)$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the bias factor $E$.",
