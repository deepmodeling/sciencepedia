            "problem": "A dilute, non-electrolytic solute diffuses in a quiescent solvent along a long planar channel, with spatial variation only in the axial coordinate $x$. The system is isothermal at absolute temperature $T$, and pressure is uniform. The molar concentration field is prescribed to be linear, $c(x) = c_{0} + a x$, where $c_{0}$ and $a$ are constants, and the effective diffusion coefficient is spatially uniform and constant, $D = \\text{const}$.

It requires the derivation of Fick's first law from the principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, which is a standard procedure in physical chemistry and transport phenomena. The assumptions (isothermal, ideal dilute solution, linear regime) are appropriate for such a derivation.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary information and a clear, logical path for the derivation and subsequent calculation. A unique solution for the molar flux is expected.\n- **Objectivity**: The language is precise, technical, and free of any subjectivity or ambiguity.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. It is deemed **valid**. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe foundation of our analysis is the expression for the local volumetric rate of entropy production, $\\sigma_s$, for an irreversible process. For diffusion in a one-dimensional, isothermal system, this is given by:\n$$ T \\sigma_s = -J \\frac{d\\mu}{dx} $$\nwhere $J$ is the molar flux of the solute, $\\mu$ is its chemical potential, and $T$ is the constant absolute temperature.\n\nAccording to the formalism of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, in the linear regime near equilibrium, the thermodynamic flux is proportional to its conjugate thermodynamic force. From the entropy production equation, the flux is identified as $J$ and the conjugate force as $X = -d\\mu/dx$. The linear phenomenological relation is therefore:\n$$ J = L X = -L \\frac{d\\mu}{dx} $$\nwhere $L$ is the phenomenological transport coefficient, which is positive definite ($L  0$).\n\nThe problem specifies a dilute, non-electrolytic solution, for which the chemical potential $\\mu$ can be described by the ideal solution model:\n$$ \\mu(c) = \\mu^{\\circ}(T, P) + RT \\ln(c) $$\nwhere $\\mu^{\\circ}$ is the standard-state chemical potential (a function of $T$ and pressure $P$, but not concentration $c$), $R$ is the ideal gas constant, and $c$ is the molar concentration.\n\nTo establish the constitutive relation for $J$ in terms of the concentration field $c(x)$, we must first express the force, $-d\\mu/dx$, in terms of the concentration gradient, $dc/dx$. We use the chain rule of differentiation:\n$$ \\frac{d\\mu}{dx} = \\frac{d\\mu}{dc} \\frac{dc}{dx} $$\nThe derivative of $\\mu$ with respect to $c$ is found from its definition:\n$$ \\frac{d\\mu}{dc} = \\frac{d}{dc} \\left( \\mu^{\\circ} + RT \\ln(c) \\right) = \\frac{RT}{c} $$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for the gradient of the chemical potential yields:\n$$ \\frac{d\\mu}{dx} = \\left( \\frac{RT}{c} \\right) \\frac{dc}{dx} $$\nNow, we insert this expression for the chemical potential gradient into our linear phenomenological law for the flux $J$:\n$$ J = -L \\left( \\frac{RT}{c} \\frac{dc}{dx} \\right) = -\\left(\\frac{LRT}{c}\\right) \\frac{dc}{dx} $$\nThis equation is the derived constitutive relation. By comparing it to the empirical Fick's first law of diffusion, $J = -D \\frac{dc}{dx}$, we can identify the diffusion coefficient $D$ as:\n$$ D = \\frac{LRT}{c} $$\nThe problem states that $D$ is a constant, which implies that the phenomenological coefficient $L$ must be directly proportional to the concentration $c$, a condition that is consistent with more detailed kinetic theories (e.g., the Einstein relation, where the mobility is constant for a dilute system). With $D$ taken as a given constant, the derived constitutive relation is precisely Fick's first law:\n$$ J = -D \\frac{dc}{dx} $$\n\nWe now apply this law to compute the steady molar flux for the given linear concentration profile:\n$$ c(x) = c_0 + ax $$\nThe concentration gradient is found by differentiating $c(x)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$ \\frac{dc}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} (c_0 + ax) = a $$\nSince the gradient is constant, the flux $J$ is also constant throughout the channel, which is a condition for a steady-state system with no internal sources or sinks. Substituting the gradient into the flux law gives:\n$$ J = -D a $$\nThis is the analytical expression for the steady molar flux.\n\nThe problem requires an analysis of the sign of $J$ when $a  0$. If $a  0$, the concentration gradient is positive, meaning the concentration increases in the positive $x$-direction. The second law of thermodynamics dictates that net transport of a species occurs spontaneously from a region of higher chemical potential (and thus higher concentration for an ideal solution) to a region of lower chemical potential. Consequently, the flux must be directed in the negative $x$-direction. Our result $J = -Da$ confirms this: since $D  0$ and we assume $a  0$, the product $-Da$ is negative, so $J  0$.\n\nFinally, we determine the SI units for the molar flux $J$. Molar flux represents the amount of substance (in moles) that flows across a unit area per unit time. Therefore, its units in the International System of Units (SI) are moles per square meter per second, which is written as $\\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-2} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}$. This is consistent with the units of the derived expression $J = -Da$: the units of $D$ are $\\text{m}^2 \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}$ and the units of $a = dc/dx$ are $(\\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-3})/\\text{m} = \\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-4}$, so the product has units of $(\\text{m}^2 \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}) \\cdot (\\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-4}) = \\text{mol} \\cdot \\text{m}^{-2} \\cdot \\text{s}^{-1}$.",

A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe derivation begins with the principle of mass conservation. For a one-dimensional system without sources or sinks (negligible reaction), the conservation equation for a solute with concentration $c(x,t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial J}{\\partial x} = 0\n$$\nwhere $J$ is the solute flux. The problem states that transport is governed by Fickian diffusion. Fick's first law defines the diffusive flux as being proportional to the negative of the concentration gradient:\n$$\nJ = -D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\n$$\nwhere $D$ is the constant diffusion coefficient. Substituting Fick's first law into the conservation equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left(-D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\\right) = 0\n$$\nSince $D$ is constant, this simplifies to Fick's second law of diffusion, which is the governing PDE for this problem:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2} \\quad \\text{for } x0, t0\n$$\nThe problem is subject to the following initial and boundary conditions:\n1.  Initial Condition (IC): $c(x, 0) = c_0$ for $x \\geq 0$.\n2.  Boundary Condition 1 (BC1): $c(0, t) = c_s$ for $t  0$.\n3.  Boundary Condition 2 (BC2): $c(x \\to \\infty, t) = c_0$ for $t  0$. This condition reflects the fact that at a location infinitely far from the boundary source, the concentration remains at its initial value.\n\nThis problem lacks a characteristic length or time scale, which suggests a solution can be found using a similarity transformation. We combine the independent variables $x$ and $t$ into a single dimensionless similarity variable, $\\eta$:\n$$\n\\eta = \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{4Dt}}\n$$\nThe factor of $4$ is a standard convention that simplifies the resulting ordinary differential equation (ODE). We assume the solution $c(x,t)$ can be expressed as a function of $\\eta$ alone, $c(x,t) = f(\\eta)$. We use the chain rule to transform the partial derivatives in the PDE into ordinary derivatives with respect to $\\eta$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = \\frac{df}{d\\eta}\\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial t} = \\frac{df}{d\\eta} \\left( \\frac{x}{\\sqrt{4D}} \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}t^{-3/2}\\right) \\right) = -\\frac{df}{d\\eta} \\frac{x}{2t\\sqrt{4Dt}} = -\\frac{\\eta}{2t}\\frac{df}{d\\eta}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} = \\frac{df}{d\\eta}\\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial x} = \\frac{df}{d\\eta}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4Dt}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{df}{d\\eta}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4Dt}}\\right) = \\frac{d^2f}{d\\eta^2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial x}\\right)\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4Dt}} = \\frac{d^2f}{d\\eta^2} \\frac{1}{4Dt}\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions into the PDE gives:\n$$\n-\\frac{\\eta}{2t}\\frac{df}{d\\eta} = D \\left( \\frac{1}{4Dt} \\frac{d^2f}{d\\eta^2} \\right)\n$$\nSimplifying this equation yields the ODE:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2f}{d\\eta^2} + 2\\eta\\frac{df}{d\\eta} = 0\n$$\nNext, we transform the boundary conditions into conditions on $f(\\eta)$:\n1.  BC1: $c(0, t) = c_s$ corresponds to $\\eta = 0/\\sqrt{4Dt} = 0$. Thus, $f(0) = c_s$.\n2.  BC2: $c(x \\to \\infty, t) = c_0$ corresponds to $\\eta \\to \\infty$. Thus, $f(\\eta \\to \\infty) = c_0$.\n\nTo solve the ODE, let $g(\\eta) = df/d\\eta$. The equation becomes a first-order separable ODE for $g$:\n$$\n\\frac{dg}{d\\eta} = -2\\eta g \\implies \\frac{dg}{g} = -2\\eta d\\eta\n$$\nIntegrating both sides gives $\\ln(g) = -\\eta^2 + K_1$, or $g(\\eta) = A \\exp(-\\eta^2)$, where $A = \\exp(K_1)$ is a constant of integration. Since $g = df/d\\eta$, we integrate again to find $f(\\eta)$:\n$$\nf(\\eta) = \\int A \\exp(-\\xi^2) d\\xi + B\n$$\nwhere $B$ is a second integration constant. Using the boundary condition $f(0) = c_s$, we can write a definite integral:\n$$\nf(\\eta) - f(0) = \\int_0^\\eta A \\exp(-\\xi^2) d\\xi \\implies f(\\eta) = c_s + A \\int_0^\\eta \\exp(-\\xi^2) d\\xi\n$$\nNow, we apply the second boundary condition, $f(\\eta \\to \\infty) = c_0$:\n$$\nc_0 = c_s + A \\int_0^\\infty \\exp(-\\xi^2) d\\xi\n$$\nThe definite integral is a known Gaussian integral, $\\int_0^\\infty \\exp(-\\xi^2) d\\xi = \\sqrt{\\pi}/2$. Substituting this value:\n$$\nc_0 = c_s + A \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2} \\implies A = \\frac{2(c_0 - c_s)}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $A$ back into the solution for $f(\\eta)$:\n$$\nf(\\eta) = c_s + \\frac{2(c_0 - c_s)}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\int_0^\\eta \\exp(-\\xi^2) d\\xi\n$$\nThis expression can be written compactly using the definition of the error function, $\\text{erf}(z) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\int_0^z \\exp(-t^2) dt$:\n$$\nf(\\eta) = c_s + (c_0 - c_s)\\text{erf}(\\eta)\n$$\nSubstituting back $\\eta = x/\\sqrt{4Dt} = x/(2\\sqrt{Dt})$, we obtain the explicit analytic expression for the concentration field $c(x,t)$:\n$$\nc(x,t) = c_s + (c_0 - c_s)\\text{erf}\\left(\\frac{x}{2\\sqrt{Dt}}\\right)\n$$\nNext, we find the penetration depth $x_{1/2}(t)$, defined as the location where the concentration is the arithmetic mean of the surface and initial concentrations, $c(x_{1/2},t) = \\frac{c_s + c_0}{2}$. We set our solution equal to this value:\n$$\n\\frac{c_s + c_0}{2} = c_s + (c_0 - c_s)\\text{erf}\\left(\\frac{x_{1/2}}{2\\sqrt{Dt}}\\right)\n$$\nSolving for the error function term:\n$$\n\\frac{c_0 - c_s}{2} = (c_0 - c_s)\\text{erf}\\left(\\frac{x_{1/2}}{2\\sqrt{Dt}}\\right)\n$$\nSince the problem states $c_s \\neq c_0$, we can divide by $(c_0 - c_s)$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} = \\text{erf}\\left(\\frac{x_{1/2}}{2\\sqrt{Dt}}\\right)\n$$\nTo isolate $x_{1/2}$, we apply the inverse error function, $\\text{arcerf}$, to both sides:\n$$\n\\text{arcerf}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = \\frac{x_{1/2}}{2\\sqrt{Dt}}\n$$\nSolving for $x_{1/2}(t)$ gives the explicit analytic expression for the penetration depth:\n$$\nx_{1/2}(t) = 2 \\text{arcerf}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\sqrt{Dt}\n$$\nThis expression demonstrates the required scaling. The term $2 \\text{arcerf}(1/2)$ is a constant. Let this constant be $\\beta = 2 \\text{arcerf}(1/2)$. Then $x_{1/2}(t) = \\beta \\sqrt{Dt}$.

It describes a standard one-dimensional, steady-state diffusion-reaction system, a fundamental topic in physical chemistry and transport phenomena. All necessary conditions and parameters are provided to derive a unique and meaningful solution. The problem is therefore valid. We shall proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nFirst, we derive the governing differential equation from the principle of conservation of mass. Consider a differential control volume element of the slab with area $A$ and thickness $\\Delta x$, from position $x$ to $x + \\Delta x$. The mass balance for the solute in this volume is:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Accumulation} = \\text{Rate of Inflow} - \\text{Rate of Outflow} + \\text{Rate of Generation}\n$$\nIn mathematical terms, this is written as:\n$$\nA \\Delta x \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = (A J_x)|_x - (A J_x)|_{x+\\Delta x} + R (A \\Delta x)\n$$\nwhere $c(x,t)$ is the solute concentration, $J_x$ is the molar flux in the $x$-direction, and $R$ is the volumetric rate of reaction.

We are given two constitutive relations. First, Fick's first law defines the diffusive flux:\n$$\nJ_x = -D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\n$$\nwhere $D$ is the diffusivity, which is stated to be a constant. Second, the solute is consumed by a first-order reaction with rate $R = -k c$, where $k$ is a positive rate constant. Substituting these into the conservation equation yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(-D \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x}\\right) - k c\n$$\nSince $D$ is constant, it can be taken out of the derivative:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2} - k c\n$$\nThis is the general reaction-diffusion equation for this system. The problem asks for the steady-state concentration profile, $c(x)$, which means the concentration does not change with time. Therefore, the accumulation term is zero: $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = 0$. The partial derivatives with respect to $x$ become ordinary derivatives, as $c$ is now only a function of $x$. The steady-state governing equation is:\n$$\nD \\frac{d^2 c}{dx^2} - k c = 0\n$$\nwhich can be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 c}{dx^2} - \\frac{k}{D} c = 0\n$$\nThis is a second-order, linear, homogeneous ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients.\n\nNext, we must state the boundary conditions.\n1. At the boundary $x=0$, the concentration is held at a constant value $c_0$:\n$$\nc(0) = c_0\n$$\n2. At the boundary $x=L$, the slab is impermeable. This means there is zero net transport across the boundary, so the diffusive flux is zero: $J_x(L) = 0$. Using Fick's first law:\n$$\nJ_x(L) = -D \\frac{dc}{dx}\\Bigg|_{x=L} = 0\n$$\nSince $D$ is a non-zero constant, this implies that the gradient of the concentration is zero at this boundary:\n$$\n\\frac{dc}{dx}\\Bigg|_{x=L} = 0\n$$\nWe now solve the boundary value problem. Let $\\lambda^2 = \\frac{k}{D}$. The governing equation becomes $\\frac{d^2 c}{dx^2} - \\lambda^2 c = 0$. The characteristic equation is $r^2 - \\lambda^2 = 0$, with roots $r = \\pm \\lambda$. The general solution can be written in terms of exponential functions or, more conveniently for this problem, hyperbolic functions:\n$$\nc(x) = C_1 \\cosh(\\lambda x) + C_2 \\sinh(\\lambda x)\n$$\nWe determine the constants of integration, $C_1$ and $C_2$, by applying the boundary conditions.\nApplying the first boundary condition, $c(0) = c_0$:\n$$\nc(0) = C_1 \\cosh(0) + C_2 \\sinh(0) = C_1(1) + C_2(0) = C_1\n$$\nThus, $C_1 = c_0$.

Here, $a = \\lambda L$ and $b = \\lambda x$. Therefore, the numerator is $\\cosh(\\lambda L - \\lambda x) = \\cosh(\\lambda(L-x))$. The solution simplifies to:\n$$\nc(x) = c_0 \\frac{\\cosh(\\lambda(L-x))}{\\cosh(\\lambda L)}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute back the definition $\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}$ to obtain the final expression for the steady-state concentration profile in terms of the given parameters:\n$$\nc(x) = c_0 \\frac{\\cosh\\left((L-x)\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right)}{\\cosh\\left(L\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{D}}\\right)}\n$$\nThis is the complete, closed-form analytic solution for the concentration profile $c(x)$ on the domain $0 \\le x \\le L$.",
