The task is to analyze the local stability of the nontrivial equilibrium point of this system.\n\nFirst, we identify the equilibrium points by setting the rate of change of the biomass concentration to zero. An equilibrium point, denoted as $x_{eq}$, is a value of $x$ for which the system does not change over time. Mathematically, this corresponds to solving $\\frac{dx}{dt} = 0$.\n$$\nf(x_{eq}) = a x_{eq} - b x_{eq}^{2} = 0\n$$\nFactoring the expression gives:\n$$\nx_{eq} (a - b x_{eq}) = 0\n$$\nThis equation yields two solutions for the equilibrium points:\n1.

Therefore, retaining only the first-order term in $\\eta(t)$, the right-hand side becomes:\n$$\nf(x^{\\ast} + \\eta(t)) \\approx f'(x^{\\ast})\\eta(t)\n$$\nEquating the left-hand and right-hand sides gives the linearized perturbation equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\eta}{dt} = f'(x^{\\ast})\\eta(t)\n$$\nTo find the explicit form of this equation, we must compute the derivative of $f(x)$ and evaluate it at $x^{\\ast}$.

Its first derivative with respect to $x$ is:\n$$\nf'(x) = \\frac{df}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx}(ax - bx^2) = a - 2bx\n$$\nNow, we evaluate this derivative at the nontrivial equilibrium $x^{\\ast} = \\frac{a}{b}$:\n$$\nf'(x^{\\ast}) = f'\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right) = a - 2b\\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right) = a - 2a = -a\n$$\nThe coefficient $f'(x^{\\ast})$ is the single eigenvalue of this one-dimensional linearized system. The eigenvalue, denoted by $\\lambda$, determines the local stability of the equilibrium. For a one-dimensional system of the form $\\frac{d\\eta}{dt} = \\lambda \\eta$, the coefficient $\\lambda$ is the eigenvalue.\nTherefore, the linearized equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\eta}{dt} = -a \\eta(t)\n$$\nThe eigenvalue of the linearized system at the equilibrium $x^{\\ast}$ is the coefficient of $\\eta(t)$:\n$$\n\\lambda = -a\n$$\nThe parameter $a$ has units of a rate, or time$^{-1}$.
