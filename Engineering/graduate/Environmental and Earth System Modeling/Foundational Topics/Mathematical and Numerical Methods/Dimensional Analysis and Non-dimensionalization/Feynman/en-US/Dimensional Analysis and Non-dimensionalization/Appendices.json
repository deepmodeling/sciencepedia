We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe governing advection–diffusion equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + U \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} = D \\frac{\\partial^{2} c}{\\partial x^{2}}\n$$\nTo non-dimensionalize this equation, we introduce dimensionless variables. We are given the characteristic concentration $C_0$ and the characteristic length scale $L$. The problem asks to choose an appropriate time scale. A natural choice for transport problems involving fluid flow is the advective timescale, which represents the time it takes for a fluid parcel to travel the characteristic length $L$ at speed $U$. Let this time scale be $T_A$.\n\nThe characteristic scales are:\n-   Length: $L$\n-   Concentration: $C_0$\n-   Time: $T_A = \\frac{L}{U}$\n\nWe define the following dimensionless variables, denoted with a prime ($'$):\n-   Dimensionless concentration: $c' = \\frac{c}{C_0}$\n-   Dimensionless length: $x' = \\frac{x}{L}$\n-   Dimensionless time: $t' = \\frac{t}{T_A} = \\frac{t U}{L}$\n\nNext, we express the derivatives in the original PDE in terms of these new dimensionless variables using the chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial (C_0 c')}{\\partial t} = C_0 \\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial t} = C_0 \\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial t'} \\frac{\\partial t'}{\\partial t} = C_0 \\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial t'} \\left(\\frac{U}{L}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial (C_0 c')}{\\partial x} = C_0 \\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial x} = C_0 \\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial x'} \\frac{\\partial x'}{\\partial x} = C_0 \\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial x'} \\left(\\frac{1}{L}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2} c}{\\partial x^{2}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{C_0}{L} \\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial x'}\\right) = \\frac{C_0}{L} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x'}\\left(\\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial x'}\\right) \\frac{\\partial x'}{\\partial x} = \\frac{C_0}{L} \\frac{\\partial^{2} c'}{\\partial x'^2} \\left(\\frac{1}{L}\\right) = \\frac{C_0}{L^2} \\frac{\\partial^{2} c'}{\\partial x'^2}\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions back into the original PDE:\n$$\nC_0 \\frac{U}{L} \\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial t'} + U \\left(\\frac{C_0}{L} \\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial x'}\\right) = D \\left(\\frac{C_0}{L^2} \\frac{\\partial^{2} c'}{\\partial x'^2}\\right)\n$$\nTo simplify and complete the non-dimensionalization, we divide the entire equation by the group of coefficients from the advection term, $\\frac{C_0 U}{L}$:\n$$\n\\frac{C_0 U/L}{C_0 U/L} \\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial t'} + \\frac{C_0 U/L}{C_0 U/L} \\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial x'} = \\frac{D C_0/L^2}{C_0 U/L} \\frac{\\partial^{2} c'}{\\partial x'^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial t'} + \\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial x'} = \\left(\\frac{D C_0}{L^2}\\right) \\left(\\frac{L}{C_0 U}\\right) \\frac{\\partial^{2} c'}{\\partial x'^2}\n$$\nSimplifying the coefficient on the right-hand side gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial t'} + \\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial x'} = \\frac{D}{UL} \\frac{\\partial^{2} c'}{\\partial x'^2}\n$$\nThe single dimensionless group that appears is the term $\\frac{UL}{D}$. This is the Peclet number, commonly denoted as $\\text{Pe}$.\n$$\n\\text{Pe} = \\frac{UL}{D}\n$$\nThe dimensionless advection-diffusion equation can thus be written as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial t'} + \\frac{\\partial c'}{\\partial x'} = \\frac{1}{\\text{Pe}} \\frac{\\partial^{2} c'}{\\partial x'^2}\n$$\nThe Peclet number, $\\text{Pe} = \\frac{UL}{D}$, quantifies the relative strength of advection to diffusion. A large $\\text{Pe}$ indicates that advection dominates transport, while a small $\\text{Pe}$ indicates that diffusion dominates.\n\nNow, we compute the value of the Peclet number for the given parameters: $U = 0.5\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$, $L = 1000\\,\\mathrm{m}$, and $D = 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}}$.\n$$\n\\text{Pe} = \\frac{(0.5\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}})(1000\\,\\mathrm{m})}{10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}}} = \\frac{500\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}}{10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}}} = 500 \\times 10^5 = 5 \\times 10^7\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in scientific notation with four significant figures, which is $5.000 \\times 10^7$.\n\nFinally, we provide an interpretation of the transport regime. The computed Peclet number is $\\text{Pe} = 5 \\times 10^7$, which is a very large number ($\\text{Pe} \\gg 1$). This indicates that the transport process is strongly dominated by advection.\n\nWe can justify this interpretation by comparing the characteristic timescales for advection and diffusion.\nThe characteristic advective timescale, $T_A$, is the time required to transport the substance over the distance $L$ by the mean flow:\n$$\nT_A = \\frac{L}{U} = \\frac{1000\\,\\mathrm{m}}{0.5\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}} = 2000\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThe characteristic diffusive timescale, $T_D$, is the time required for the substance to spread over the distance $L$ by molecular diffusion:\n$$\nT_D = \\frac{L^2}{D} = \\frac{(1000\\,\\mathrm{m})^2}{10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}}} = \\frac{10^6\\,\\mathrm{m^2}}{10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}}} = 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nThe ratio of these two timescales is:\n$$\n\\frac{T_D}{T_A} = \\frac{L^2/D}{L/U} = \\frac{UL}{D} = \\text{Pe}\n$$\nOur computed value of $\\text{Pe} = 5 \\times 10^7$ means that $T_D = (5 \\times 10^7) \\times T_A$. The time required for diffusion to be a significant transport mechanism is over $7$ orders of magnitude larger than the time it takes for advection to transport the pollutant through the entire length of the channel. For this system, a pollutant entering at $x=0$ would be advected past $x=L$ in $2000$ seconds (about $33.3$ minutes), whereas it would take approximately $10^{11}$ seconds (about $3170$ years) for diffusion to spread the pollutant across the same distance. Therefore, on the timescale of advective transport, the effect of diffusion is negligible. The regime is advection-dominated.",

            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of fluid mechanics and sediment transport, is well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and is expressed in objective, formal language.\n\nThe objective is to formulate a dimensionless group, the Rouse number, by comparing the characteristic scales of downward gravitational settling and upward turbulent diffusion of sediment particles in a near-wall shear flow. The problem requires the derivation of this number in terms of the particle settling velocity $w_s$, the shear velocity $u_*$, and the von Kármán constant $\\kappa$.\n\nThe vertical transport of suspended sediment is governed by a balance between two competing processes: downward settling due to gravity and upward diffusion due to turbulence. We can define a characteristic flux for each process.\n\nThe downward flux of sediment due to gravity, $F_s$, is proportional to the local sediment concentration $C$ and the terminal settling velocity of the particles $w_s$. The characteristic velocity scale for this process is therefore $w_s$.\n$$\n\\text{Characteristic settling velocity scale} = w_s\n$$\nThe upward flux due to turbulence, $F_d$, is modeled as a diffusive process. Following the Boussinesq hypothesis, this flux is proportional to the negative gradient of the concentration: $F_d = -K_s \\frac{dC}{dz}$, where $K_s$ is the eddy diffusivity for sediment and $z$ is the vertical coordinate. To find the characteristic velocity scale for this process, we must first determine the scaling for $K_s$.\n\nThe problem specifies that the analysis should be grounded in near-wall turbulence scaling, characterized by a mixing length. According to Prandtl's mixing length theory for a turbulent boundary layer, the eddy viscosity for momentum, $\\nu_t$, is given by:\n$$\n\\nu_t = l_m^2 \\left| \\frac{du}{dz} \\right|\n$$\nwhere $l_m$ is the mixing length and $\\frac{du}{dz}$ is the mean velocity gradient. In the logarithmic layer near the wall, the mixing length is proportional to the distance from the wall, $l_m = \\kappa z$, where $\\kappa$ is the von Kármán constant. The velocity profile in this layer is given by the law of the wall, $u(z) = \\frac{u_*}{\\kappa} \\ln\\left(\\frac{z}{z_0}\\right)$, from which the velocity gradient is:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dz} = \\frac{u_*}{\\kappa z}\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions for $l_m$ and $\\frac{du}{dz}$ into the formula for $\\nu_t$:\n$$\n\\nu_t = (\\kappa z)^2 \\left( \\frac{u_*}{\\kappa z} \\right) = \\kappa u_* z\n$$\nThe sediment eddy diffusivity, $K_s$, is assumed to be proportional to the momentum eddy viscosity, $K_s = \\beta \\nu_t$, where $\\beta$ is a dimensionless constant typically assumed to be of order $1$. As no value for $\\beta$ is provided, and the problem asks for a derivation using only the given variables, we take $K_s$ to be of the same scale as $\\nu_t$. Therefore, the characteristic scale for the sediment diffusivity is:\n$$\nK_s \\propto \\kappa u_* z\n$$\nThe characteristic velocity of turbulent diffusion can be estimated as the diffusivity divided by the characteristic length scale over which it acts. In the near-wall region, this length scale is the distance from the wall, $z$. Thus, the characteristic upward velocity scale for turbulent suspension is:\n$$\n\\text{Characteristic turbulent suspension velocity scale} \\sim \\frac{K_s}{z} \\propto \\frac{\\kappa u_* z}{z} = \\kappa u_*\n$$\nThe Rouse number, denoted here by $P$, is the dimensionless ratio of the characteristic downward settling velocity to the characteristic upward turbulent suspension velocity.\n$$\nP = \\frac{\\text{settling velocity scale}}{\\text{turbulent suspension velocity scale}}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived scales, we obtain the explicit closed-form expression for the Rouse number:\n$$\nP = \\frac{w_s}{\\kappa u_*}\n$$\nPhysically, the Rouse number quantifies the relative importance of settling versus turbulent suspension.\n- If $P \\ll 1$, it implies that $w_s \\ll \\kappa u_*$. The turbulent suspension velocity is much greater than the settling velocity. Sediment particles are easily kept in suspension and will be distributed relatively uniformly throughout the water column. This regime corresponds to a wash load.\n- If $P \\gg 1$, it implies that $w_s \\gg \\kappa u_*$. The settling velocity is much greater than the turbulent suspension velocity. Gravity dominates, and particles tend to settle out quickly, remaining concentrated very near the bed.
