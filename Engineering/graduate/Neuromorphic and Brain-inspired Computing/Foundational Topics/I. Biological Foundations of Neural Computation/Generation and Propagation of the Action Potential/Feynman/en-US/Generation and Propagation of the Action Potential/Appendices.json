            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the resting membrane potential, $V_m$, for a system with three permeable ions ($\\mathrm{K}^{+}$, $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, and $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$) based on the Nernst–Planck electrodiffusion law and the constant-field approximation. Subsequently, this potential must be calculated numerically using the provided data.\n\nThe validation of the problem statement has been performed. The problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of biophysical electrodiffusion, specifically the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz model. It is well-posed, with all necessary parameters and conditions provided, and is free from contradictions or ambiguities. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe derivation begins with the one-dimensional Nernst–Planck equation for the flux density, $J_s$, of an ionic species $s$ across the membrane in the direction $x$:\n$$ J_s = -D_s \\left( \\frac{dC_s(x)}{dx} + \\frac{z_s F}{RT} C_s(x) \\frac{d\\phi(x)}{dx} \\right) $$\nwhere $D_s$ is the diffusion coefficient of the ion in the membrane, $C_s(x)$ is its concentration at position $x$ within the membrane, $z_s$ is its valence, $F$ is the Faraday constant, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $\\phi(x)$ is the electric potential.\n\nThe constant-field approximation assumes that the electric field, $E$, is uniform across the membrane thickness, $L$. The membrane potential is defined as $V_m = \\phi_i - \\phi_o$, where $\\phi_i$ is the potential at the inner surface ($x=L$) and $\\phi_o$ is the potential at the outer surface ($x=0$).\n$$ E = -\\frac{d\\phi}{dx} = \\frac{\\phi_o - \\phi_i}{L} = -\\frac{V_m}{L} $$\nTherefore, the potential gradient is constant: $\\frac{d\\phi}{dx} = \\frac{V_m}{L}$.\n\nSubstituting the constant potential gradient into the Nernst–Planck equation gives a first-order ordinary differential equation for $C_s(x)$:\n$$ J_s = -D_s \\left( \\frac{dC_s}{dx} + \\frac{z_s F V_m}{RT L} C_s \\right) $$\nIn the steady state, the flux $J_s$ for each ion species must be constant across the membrane. This equation can be solved for $J_s$ by integrating across the membrane from $x=0$ to $x=L$.

            "solution": "The problem asks for two parts: first, to derive the steady-state cable equation and the expression for the length constant $\\lambda$ for a uniform cylindrical dendritic segment; second, to compute the numerical value of $\\lambda$ given specific parameters.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Cable Equation and Length Constant $\\lambda$**\n\nWe model the dendritic segment as a one-dimensional passive cable, which is a continuous structure. To analyze it, we consider an infinitesimal segment of the cable of length $dx$. We need to define the electrical properties of this segment: the axial resistance to current flow along the cable's interior and the membrane resistance to current flow across the membrane.\n\nThe givens are the cable radius $a$, the specific membrane resistance $R_m$ (in units of resistance $\\times$ area, e.g., $\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}^2$), and the intracellular resistivity $R_i$ (in units of resistance $\\times$ length, e.g., $\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}$).\n\n1.  **Axial Resistance per Unit Length ($r_i$)**: The axial resistance is the resistance to current flowing along the x-axis inside the dendrite. The resistance $R$ of a conductor is given by $R = \\rho \\frac{L}{A}$, where $\\rho$ is the resistivity, $L$ is the length, and $A$ is the cross-sectional area. Here, the resistivity is $R_i$, the length of our segment is $dx$, and the cross-sectional area of the cylinder is $A = \\pi a^2$. The resistance of the segment $dx$ is thus $dR_i = R_i \\frac{dx}{\\pi a^2}$. The axial resistance per unit length, $r_i$, is defined as this resistance divided by the length $dx$.\n    $$r_i = \\frac{R_i}{\\pi a^2}$$\n    The units of $r_i$ are resistance/length (e.g., $\\Omega/\\text{cm}$).\n\n2.  **Membrane Resistance and Current**: The membrane resistance describes the leakage of current out of the cell. The specific membrane resistance $R_m$ has units of resistance $\\times$ area. For our cylindrical segment of length $dx$, the surface area is $dA = 2\\pi a dx$. The total resistance of this patch of membrane is $R_{patch} = \\frac{R_m}{dA} = \\frac{R_m}{2\\pi a dx}$.\n    The membrane current per unit length, $i_m$, is the current that leaks out through the membrane per unit length of the cable. According to Ohm's law, this current is the membrane potential $V(x)$ divided by the effective membrane resistance of a unit length of the cable. Let's define the membrane resistance for a unit length cable as $r_m$. The current leaking out of a segment $dx$ is $i_m dx = \\frac{V}{R_{patch}} = \\frac{V(2\\pi a dx)}{R_m}$.\n    Therefore, the membrane current per unit length is:\n    $$i_m = \\frac{2\\pi a}{R_m} V(x)$$\n    It is common to define the membrane resistance of a unit-length cylinder, $r_m$, such that $i_m = \\frac{V(x)}{r_m}$. Comparing the two expressions for $i_m$, we find:\n    $$r_m = \\frac{R_m}{2\\pi a}$$\n    The units of $r_m$ are resistance $\\times$ length (e.g., $\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}$).\n\n3.  **Applying Physical Laws**:\n    We apply two fundamental laws to the segment between $x$ and $x+dx$: Ohm's Law for the axial current and Kirchhoff's Current Law for current conservation.\n    -   **Ohm's Law**: The change in voltage along the segment is related to the axial current $I_i(x)$ and the axial resistance of the segment, $r_i dx$.\n        $$V(x) - V(x+dx) = I_i(x) (r_i dx)$$\n        Taking the limit as $dx \\to 0$, we get the differential form:\n        $$-\\frac{dV}{dx} = I_i r_i$$\n\n    -   **Current Conservation**: The change in axial current along the segment must be equal to the current that leaks out through the membrane, $i_m dx$.\n        $$I_i(x) - I_i(x+dx) = i_m dx$$\n        In the limit $dx \\to 0$, this becomes:\n        $$-\\frac{dI_i}{dx} = i_m$$\n\n4.  **Deriving the Cable Equation**: We can combine these two first-order differential equations into a single second-order equation for $V(x)$. First, we differentiate the Ohm's Law equation with respect to $x$:\n    $$-\\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} = r_i \\frac{dI_i}{dx}$$\n    Next, we substitute the expression for $\\frac{dI_i}{dx}$ from the current conservation equation:\n    $$-\\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} = r_i (-i_m) = -r_i i_m$$\n    Now, we substitute the expression for the membrane current, $i_m = V/r_m$:\n    $$\\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} = r_i \\frac{V}{r_m}$$\n    This can be rearranged into the steady-state cable equation:\n    $$\\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} - \\frac{r_i}{r_m} V = 0$$\n    The standard form of this equation is written using the length constant (or space constant), $\\lambda$, as:\n    $$\\lambda^2 \\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} - V = 0$$\n    By comparing the two forms, we can identify $\\lambda^2$:\n    $$\\lambda^2 = \\frac{r_m}{r_i}$$\n    Thus, the length constant is $\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{r_m}{r_i}}$.\n\n5.  **Expressing $\\lambda$ in Terms of Fundamental Parameters**:\n    Finally, we substitute the expressions for $r_m$ and $r_i$ in terms of the given parameters $a$, $R_m$, and $R_i$:\n    $$\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_m / (2\\pi a)}{R_i / (\\pi a^2)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_m}{2\\pi a} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi a^2}{R_i}}$$\n    Simplifying the expression, we get:\n    $$\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{a R_m}{2 R_i}}$$\n    This is the expression for the length constant in terms of the specified parameters.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Calculation of $\\lambda$**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n-   $a = 0.5\\,\\mu\\text{m}$\n-   $R_m = 10^4\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}^2$\n-   $R_i = 100\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}$\n\nTo perform the calculation, we must use a consistent set of units. Let's convert all lengths to centimeters (cm).\nThe radius $a$ in cm is:\n$a = 0.5\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 0.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{cm}$\n\nNow we substitute these values into the derived formula for $\\lambda$:\n$$\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{(0.5 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\text{cm}) \\cdot (10^4\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}^2)}{2 \\cdot (100\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm})}}$$\nLet's first evaluate the expression inside the square root:\n$$\\frac{(0.5 \\times 10^{-4}) \\cdot (10^4)}{2 \\cdot 100} = \\frac{0.5}{200} = \\frac{1}{400} = 0.0025$$\nThe units inside the square root are:\n$$\\frac{\\text{cm} \\cdot (\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}^2)}{\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}} = \\frac{\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}^3}{\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}} = \\text{cm}^2$$\nSo, we have:\n$$\\lambda = \\sqrt{0.0025 \\text{ cm}^2}$$\n$$\\lambda = 0.05 \\text{ cm}$$\nThe problem asks for the answer to be expressed in millimeters (mm).

Per-unit-length capacitance and radial conductance for a coaxial cylinder\n\nConsider a coaxial geometry with inner radius $a$ and outer radius $b$, filled with a dielectric of permittivity $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0$. The capacitance per unit length $C_m$ (units $\\mathrm{F/m}$) of a coaxial capacitor is a classical result:\n$$\nC_m = \\frac{2\\pi \\varepsilon}{\\ln(b/a)}.\n$$\nSimilarly, if the medium between the cylinders has conductivity $\\sigma$ (units $\\mathrm{S/m}$), then the shunt (radial) conductance per unit length $G_m$ (units $\\mathrm{S/m}$) between the inner and outer conductors is\n$$\nG_m = \\frac{2\\pi \\sigma}{\\ln(b/a)}.\n$$\nThe corresponding membrane resistance per unit length $R_m$ (units $\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}$) is the reciprocal:\n$$\nR_m = \\frac{1}{G_m} = \\frac{\\ln(b/a)}{2\\pi \\sigma}.\n$$\nThese are well-tested formulas for coaxial transmission lines under quasi-static conditions and provide the per-unit-length parameters needed for cable analysis.\n\n2. Axial resistance per unit length and cable parameters\n\nThe axial resistance per unit length $r_a$ (units $\\Omega/\\mathrm{m}$) of a cylindrical core with resistivity $R_i$ (units $\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}$) and cross-sectional area $\\pi a^2$ is given by\n$$\nr_a = \\frac{R_i}{\\pi a^2}.\n$$\nIn one-dimensional passive cable theory, using per-unit-length membrane resistance $R_m$ and capacitance $C_m$, the membrane time constant $\\tau$ (units $\\mathrm{s}$) and the electrotonic length constant $\\lambda$ (units $\\mathrm{m}$) are\n$$\n\\tau = R_m C_m, \\quad \\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{R_m}{r_a}}.\n$$\nThese follow from the canonical cable equation expressed with per-length parameters. To see this, one can write the cable equation in terms of membrane current per unit length $i_m = V/R_m + C_m \\,\\partial V/\\partial t$ and axial current governed by Ohm’s law with $r_a$, yielding the standard parabolic partial differential equation with time constant $\\tau$ and diffusion-like coefficient $D = \\lambda^2/\\tau$.\n\n3. Approximate propagation speed\n\nThe passive cable equation is\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial V(x,t)}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 V(x,t)}{\\partial x^2} - \\frac{V(x,t)}{\\tau},\n$$\nwhere $D = \\lambda^2/\\tau$. For a localized transient or step-like driving at one end, the Green’s function solution shows that the response spreads with a characteristic diffusive length scale $\\sqrt{D t}$ while decaying with time constant $\\tau$. A pragmatic definition of a characteristic front speed $v$ is obtained by equating the time for a feature to traverse one electrotonic length to the time constant, that is, requiring $x \\sim \\lambda$ when $t \\sim \\tau$. This gives\n$$\nv \\approx \\frac{\\lambda}{\\tau}.\n$$\nThis approximation is consistent with dimensional analysis because $\\lambda/\\tau$ has units of $\\mathrm{m/s}$, and it captures the balance between spatial spread (set by $\\lambda$) and decay timing (set by $\\tau$). In myelinated fibers, saltatory conduction involves active regeneration at nodes of Ranvier; between nodes, the internodal passive spread is well approximated by this diffusive front speed, which serves as a useful proxy for conduction velocity scaling with material and geometric parameters.\n\n4. Energy per unit length per spike\n\nCharging a capacitance $C$ by a voltage $\\Delta V$ stores energy $E_C = \\tfrac{1}{2} C (\\Delta V)^2$. For an internode modeled per unit length, the energy per unit length per spike is\n$$\nE = \\alpha \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} C_m (\\Delta V)^2,\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha \\ge 1$ accounts for ionic inefficiencies and additional channel-mediated currents beyond the ideal capacitive charging.\n\n5. Algorithmic plan\n\nGiven constants $a$, $\\varepsilon_0$, $\\varepsilon_r$, $\\sigma$, $R_i$, $\\Delta V$, and $\\alpha$, and a test suite of $g$-ratio values, proceed as follows for each $g$:\n- Compute $b = a/g$ and $\\ln(b/a) = \\ln(1/g)$.\n- Compute $\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0$.\n- Compute $C_m = \\dfrac{2\\pi \\varepsilon}{\\ln(b/a)}$ and $R_m = \\dfrac{\\ln(b/a)}{2\\pi \\sigma}$.\n- Compute $r_a = \\dfrac{R_i}{\\pi a^2}$.\n- Compute $\\tau = R_m C_m$ and $\\lambda = \\sqrt{R_m/r_a}$.\n- Compute $v \\approx \\lambda/\\tau$.\n- Compute $E = \\alpha \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{2} C_m (\\Delta V)^2$.\n- Report $\\left[C_m, R_m, v, E\\right]$ for the case.\n\n6. Units and numerical notes\n\n- $C_m$ is in $\\mathrm{F/m}$, $R_m$ in $\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}$, $v$ in $\\mathrm{m/s}$, and $E$ in $\\mathrm{J/m}$.\n- The product $\\tau = R_m C_m = \\varepsilon/\\sigma$ emerges from the coaxial relations, showing that $\\tau$ is independent of $g$ under the homogeneous-sheath approximation. However, $\\lambda$ increases with $\\ln(b/a)$, so $v$ increases with myelin thickness, while $C_m$ decreases, reducing $E$; this captures the speed-energy trade-off.\n\n7. Test suite instantiation\n\nUse $a = 2.0\\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m}$, $\\varepsilon_0 = 8.854187817\\times 10^{-12}\\ \\mathrm{F/m}$, $\\varepsilon_r = 2.1$, $\\sigma = 1.0\\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{S/m}$, $R_i = 0.7\\ \\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}$, $\\Delta V = 0.1\\ \\mathrm{V}$, $\\alpha = 3.0$, and $g \\in \\{0.95, 0.80, 0.70, 0.60, 0.50\\}$. For each case, compute and output the tuple $\\left[C_m,R_m,v,E\\right]$.\n\n8. Output format\n\nProduce a single line string of the form\n$$\n\\left[ [C_1,R_1,v_1,E_1], [C_2,R_2,v_2,E_2], [C_3,R_3,v_3,E_3], [C_4,R_4,v_4,E_4], [C_5,R_5,v_5,E_5] \\right],\n$$\nwhere each numerical value is formatted in scientific notation with six significant digits.",
