For a membrane selectively permeable to a single ion, equality of electrochemical potentials across the membrane yields the Nernst relation for the equilibrium potential of that ion. However, at the resting state of a real neuron, multiple ions contribute to current, and the membrane potential adjusts such that the net current is zero.\n\nUnder the constant-field approximation (spatially uniform electric field across the membrane thickness), electrodiffusive fluxes of monovalent ions across the membrane have the form that leads to the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) current description. Imposing the steady-state condition of zero net transmembrane current,\n$$\n\\sum_i I_i = 0,\n$$\nwith $I_i$ the current carried by ion $i$, and using the constant-field expression for ionic fluxes, one obtains the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) voltage equation for monovalent ions:\n$$\nV_m = \\frac{RT}{F} \\ln\\!\\left( \\frac{P_K [K^+]_o + P_{Na} [Na^+]_o + P_{Cl} [Cl^-]_i}{P_K [K^+]_i + P_{Na} [Na^+]_i + P_{Cl} [Cl^-]_o} \\right),\n$$\nwhere $P_i$ are the permeability coefficients, and the placement of $[Cl^-]_i$ and $[Cl^-]_o$ in the numerator and denominator, respectively, reflects the negative valence of chloride.\n\nWe now compute $V_m$ numerically using the provided values.
