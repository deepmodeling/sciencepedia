Along the apical dendrite, the envelope of the bAP amplitude decays with distance from the soma in a manner consistent with passive cable theory, characterized by a length constant $\\lambda = 150\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$. Consider a recording site located at a path length $x = 300\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ from the somatic center along the dendritic shaft.

Based on cable theory and basic biophysical principles relating membrane resistance and space constant, qualitatively explain how this change would affect the bAP amplitude at the same recording site relative to your computed value. No additional numerical calculation is required.",
            "solution": "The problem is evaluated in two parts. The first part requires a quantitative calculation of the backpropagating action potential (bAP) amplitude at a specific dendritic location. The second part asks for a qualitative explanation of how changing a specific membrane property affects this amplitude.\n\n### Part 1: Calculation of bAP Amplitude\n\nThe problem states that the decay of the bAP amplitude along the apical dendrite is consistent with passive cable theory. For a semi-infinite cable, the voltage $V(x)$ at a distance $x$ from the soma (where $x=0$) attenuates exponentially according to the equation:\n$$V(x) = V(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nHere, $V(0)$ is the voltage amplitude at the soma, $x$ is the path length along the dendrite, and $\\lambda$ is the length constant of the dendrite.\n\nThe given values are:\n- The bAP peak amplitude at the soma, $V(0) = 80\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.\n- The length constant, $\\lambda = 150\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n- The distance to the recording site, $x = 300\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the equation:\n$$V(300\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}) = (80\\,\\mathrm{mV}) \\times \\exp\\left(-\\frac{300\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}{150\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}}\\right)$$\nThe ratio in the exponent simplifies to:\n$$\\frac{300}{150} = 2$$\nThus, the equation becomes:\n$$V(300\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}) = 80 \\times \\exp(-2)\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\nThe value of $\\exp(-2)$ is approximately $0.135335$.\n$$V(300\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}) \\approx 80 \\times 0.135335\\,\\mathrm{mV} \\approx 10.8268\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, as requested, we obtain:\n$$V(300\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}) \\approx 10.83\\,\\mathrm{mV}$$\n\n### Part 2: Qualitative Effect of Increased Potassium Conductance\n\nThe second part of the problem asks to determine the qualitative effect of doubling the density of transient A-type potassium conductance ($g_{K,A}$) on the bAP amplitude at the same recording site.\n\nThe length constant $\\lambda$ in passive cable theory is defined by the physical properties of the neuronal cable:\n$$\\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{r_m}{r_a}}$$\nwhere $r_m$ is the membrane resistance per unit length and $r_a$ is the axial (or internal) resistance per unit length. The problem states that geometry and axial resistivity are unchanged, so $r_a$ remains constant.\n\nThe membrane resistance $r_m$ is inversely related to the total membrane conductance per unit length, $g_m$. The total conductance is the sum of all conductances of the ion channels present in the membrane.\n$$r_m = \\frac{1}{g_m}$$\nDoubling the density of A-type $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ conductance means that this specific component of the total membrane conductance increases. Since all other conductances remain unchanged, the total membrane conductance, $g_m$, will increase.\n\nLet the new total conductance be $g'_m$. We have $g'_m > g_m$.\nThis increase in total membrane conductance leads to a decrease in the membrane resistance. Let the new membrane resistance be $r'_m$:\n$$r'_m = \\frac{1}{g'_m} < \\frac{1}{g_m} = r_m$$\nNow, we can determine the effect on the length constant. The new length constant, $\\lambda'$, is:\n$$\\lambda' = \\sqrt{\\frac{r'_m}{r_a}}$$\nSince $r'_m < r_m$ and $r_a$ is constant, the new length constant will be smaller than the original one:\n$$\\lambda' < \\lambda$$\nA smaller length constant signifies that the voltage will decay more steeply with distance along the dendrite. The voltage at the recording site $x$ is given by $V(x) = V(0) \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$. The new voltage, $V'(x)$, will be calculated with the new length constant $\\lambda'$:\n$$V'(x) = V(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda'}\\right)$$\nSince $\\lambda' < \\lambda$, the ratio $x/\\lambda'$ will be greater than $x/\\lambda$. Consequently, the negative exponent $-x/\\lambda'$ will be more negative than $-x/\\lambda$.\n$$-\\frac{x}{\\lambda'} < -\\frac{x}{\\lambda}$$\nBecause the exponential function is monotonically increasing, this means:\n$$\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda'}\\right) < \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nTherefore, the new bAP amplitude at the recording site will be smaller than the previously calculated value:\n$$V'(x) < V(x)$$\nIn summary, doubling the A-type $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ conductance increases the total leakiness of the dendritic membrane, which reduces the membrane resistance. This, in turn, shortens the length constant, causing the bAP to attenuate more significantly over the same distance. The resulting amplitude at the $300\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ site will be lower than $10.83\\,\\mathrm{mV}$.",

            "problem": "Consider a passive dendritic branch point in a neuron described by cable theory at steady state (time-independent). A parent cylindrical cable of diameter $d_{p}$ and two daughter cylindrical cables of diameters $d_{1}$ and $d_{2}$ meet at a junction. All segments are homogeneous and share the same specific membrane resistance per unit area $r_m$ and internal (axial) resistivity $r_i$. Assume each segment is semi-infinite beyond the junction, so that the junction sees only the properties of semi-infinite cables.

            "solution": "The solution proceeds by deriving the voltage reflection coefficient $\\Gamma$ at the dendritic branch point.\n\nFirst, we derive the input impedance $Z_{in}$ of a semi-infinite cylindrical cable as a function of its diameter $d$. The steady-state voltage $V$ along a passive cable is governed by the one-dimensional cable equation:\n$$ \\lambda^2 \\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} - V = 0 $$\nwhere $x$ is the distance along the cable and $\\lambda$ is the length constant. The length constant is defined as $\\lambda = \\sqrt{r_{mem} / r_{ax}}$, where $r_{mem}$ is the membrane resistance per unit length and $r_{ax}$ is the axial resistance per unit length.\n\nFor a cylindrical cable of diameter $d$ (radius $a = d/2$), with specific internal resistivity $r_i$ and specific membrane resistance $r_m$, these parameters are:\nThe axial resistance per unit length, $r_{ax}$, is the internal resistivity divided by the cross-sectional area $A = \\pi a^2 = \\pi (d/2)^2 = \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4}$.\n$$ r_{ax} = \\frac{r_i}{A} = \\frac{4 r_i}{\\pi d^2} $$\nThe membrane resistance per unit length, $r_{mem}$, is the specific membrane resistance divided by the circumference $C = 2 \\pi a = \\pi d$.\n$$ r_{mem} = \\frac{r_m}{\\pi d} $$\nSubstituting these into the expression for the length constant $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\lambda^2 = \\frac{r_{mem}}{r_{ax}} = \\frac{r_m / (\\pi d)}{4 r_i / (\\pi d^2)} = \\frac{r_m}{\\pi d} \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4 r_i} = \\frac{r_m d}{4 r_i} $$\n$$ \\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{r_m d}{4 r_i}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{r_m d}}{2 \\sqrt{r_i}} $$\nThe general solution to the cable equation is $V(x) = C_1 \\exp(x/\\lambda) + C_2 \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$. For a semi-infinite cable extending from $x=0$ towards $x \\to \\infty$, the voltage must remain bounded, which requires the coefficient of the growing exponential term, $C_1$, to be zero. Thus, the voltage profile is $V(x) = V(0) \\exp(-x/\\lambda)$, where $V(0)$ is the voltage at the start of the cable, $x=0$.\n\nThe axial current $I(x)$ is given by Ohm's law for a continuous conductor:\n$$ I(x) = -\\frac{1}{r_{ax}} \\frac{dV}{dx} = -\\frac{1}{r_{ax}} \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( V(0) \\exp(-x/\\lambda) \\right) = \\frac{V(0)}{\\lambda r_{ax}} \\exp(-x/\\lambda) $$\nThe input impedance $Z_{in}$ at $x=0$ is the ratio of voltage to current at that point:\n$$ Z_{in} = \\frac{V(0)}{I(0)} = \\frac{V(0)}{V(0) / (\\lambda r_{ax})} = \\lambda r_{ax} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\lambda$ and $r_{ax}$:\n$$ Z_{in} = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{r_m d}}{2 \\sqrt{r_i}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{4 r_i}{\\pi d^2}\\right) = \\frac{2 \\sqrt{r_i} \\sqrt{r_m d}}{\\pi d^2} = \\frac{2 \\sqrt{r_i r_m}}{\\pi} \\frac{\\sqrt{d}}{d^2} = \\frac{2 \\sqrt{r_i r_m}}{\\pi} d^{-3/2} $$\nThis demonstrates that the input impedance of a semi-infinite cable is proportional to its diameter raised to the power of $-3/2$. Since $r_i$ and $r_m$ are the same for all three cables (parent and two daughters), we can write the input impedances as:\n$$ Z_p = K d_p^{-3/2} $$\n$$ Z_1 = K d_1^{-3/2} $$\n$$ Z_2 = K d_2^{-3/2} $$\nwhere $K = \\frac{2 \\sqrt{r_i r_m}}{\\pi}$ is a constant.\n\nNext, we find the effective load impedance $Z_L$ that the parent cable sees at the junction. The two daughter cables are in parallel from the perspective of the parent branch. The equivalent impedance of two parallel impedances is given by:\n$$ \\frac{1}{Z_L} = \\frac{1}{Z_1} + \\frac{1}{Z_2} = \\frac{1}{K d_1^{-3/2}} + \\frac{1}{K d_2^{-3/2}} = \\frac{1}{K} \\left( d_1^{3/2} + d_2^{3/2} \\right) $$\nTherefore, the load impedance is:\n$$ Z_L = K \\left( d_1^{3/2} + d_2^{3/2} \\right)^{-1} $$\nThe junction represents a point where a transmission line (the parent cable) with characteristic impedance $Z_p$ is terminated by a load $Z_L$. The voltage reflection coefficient $\\Gamma$ at such a termination is given by:\n$$ \\Gamma = \\frac{Z_L - Z_p}{Z_L + Z_p} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $Z_p$ and $Z_L$:\n$$ \\Gamma = \\frac{K (d_1^{3/2} + d_2^{3/2})^{-1} - K d_p^{-3/2}}{K (d_1^{3/2} + d_2^{3/2})^{-1} + K d_p^{-3/2}} $$\nThe constant $K$ cancels from the numerator and denominator:\n$$ \\Gamma = \\frac{(d_1^{3/2} + d_2^{3/2})^{-1} - d_p^{-3/2}}{(d_1^{3/2} + d_2^{3/2})^{-1} + d_p^{-3/2}} $$\nTo simplify this expression, we can write the terms as fractions:\n$$ \\Gamma = \\frac{\\frac{1}{d_1^{3/2} + d_2^{3/2}} - \\frac{1}{d_p^{3/2}}}{\\frac{1}{d_1^{3/2} + d_2^{3/2}} + \\frac{1}{d_p^{3/2}}} $$\nNow, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by the common denominator $d_p^{3/2} (d_1^{3/2} + d_2^{3/2})$:\n$$ \\Gamma = \\frac{d_p^{3/2} - (d_1^{3/2} + d_2^{3/2})}{d_p^{3/2} + (d_1^{3/2} + d_2^{3/2})} $$\nThis is the final expression for the voltage reflection coefficient $\\Gamma$ in terms of the diameters of the parent and daughter cables. All biophysical constants have canceled out, as required. The expression shows that $\\Gamma = 0$ (no reflection) if and only if $d_p^{3/2} = d_1^{3/2} + d_2^{3/2}$, which is the $3/2$ rule for impedance matching.\n$$ \\Gamma = \\frac{d_p^{\\frac{3}{2}} - d_1^{\\frac{3}{2}} - d_2^{\\frac{3}{2}}}{d_p^{\\frac{3}{2}} + d_1^{\\frac{3}{2}} + d_2^{\\frac{3}{2}}} $$\nThis is the final analytical expression.",
