It is a standard exercise in applying the Tsodyks–Markram model of short-term synaptic plasticity, a canonical model in computational neuroscience. All parameters and initial conditions are provided and are physically plausible within the context of the model. We may therefore proceed with the derivation of a solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive an analytical expression for the paired-pulse ratio, $\\mathrm{PPR}$, defined as the ratio of the amplitudes of the second and first postsynaptic currents, $\\mathrm{PPR} = A_2/A_1$. The amplitude of the current evoked by spike $k$ is given by $A_k=\\alpha\\,u(t_k^+)\\,x(t_k^-)$, where $\\alpha$ is a constant gain. Thus, the paired-pulse ratio is independent of $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{PPR} = \\frac{A_2}{A_1} = \\frac{\\alpha\\,u(t_2^+)\\,x(t_2^-)}{\\alpha\\,u(t_1^+)\\,x(t_1^-)} = \\frac{u(t_2^+)\\,x(t_2^-)}{u(t_1^+)\\,x(t_1^-)}\n$$\nWe will calculate the quantities on the right-hand side by tracking the state variables $u(t)$ and $x(t)$ through the paired-pulse protocol.\n\n**1. State at the first spike ($t_1=0$)**\n\nThe synapse is initially at rest after a long quiescent period. The problem specifies the initial conditions just before the first spike at $t_1=0$ as:\n$$x(t_1^-) = 1$$\n$$u(t_1^-) = 0$$\nAt the time of the spike $t_1$, the variables are updated instantaneously. The utilization variable $u$ is updated first:\n$$u(t_1^+) = u(t_1^-) + U\\bigl(1-u(t_1^-)\\bigr) = 0 + U(1-0) = U$$\nThe amplitude of the first postsynaptic current, $A_1$, is proportional to the resources released by this first spike, which are $u(t_1^+)x(t_1^-)$:\n$$A_1 = \\alpha\\,u(t_1^+)\\,x(t_1^-) = \\alpha\\,U \\cdot 1 = \\alpha U$$\nAfter the release, the fraction of available resources $x$ is updated:\n$$x(t_1^+) = x(t_1^-)\\bigl(1-u(t_1^+)\\bigr) = 1 \\cdot (1-U) = 1-U$$\nThese values, $u(t_1^+)=U$ and $x(t_1^+)=1-U$, serve as the initial conditions for the evolution of the system during the inter-spike interval.\n\n**2. State evolution during the inter-spike interval ($t \\in (0, \\Delta t)$)**\n\nBetween spikes, the variables $u(t)$ and $x(t)$ relax back to their baseline values ($u=0$, $x=1$) according to the linear differential equations:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{dt}=-\\frac{u}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{fac}}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt}=\\frac{1-x}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec}}}\n$$\nWe solve these equations over the interval $t \\in [0, \\Delta t]$ with initial conditions $u(0^+) = U$ and $x(0^+) = 1-U$.\n\nThe equation for $u(t)$ is a simple exponential decay:\n$$u(t) = u(0^+)\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{fac}}}\\right) = U\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{fac}}}\\right)$$\nAt the time just before the second spike, $t_2^- = \\Delta t$, the value of $u$ is:\n$$u(t_2^-) = U\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{fac}}}\\right)$$\n\nThe equation for $x(t)$ can be solved by defining a new variable $y(t) = 1-x(t)$. The differential equation becomes $dy/dt = -y/\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec}}$, which has the solution $y(t) = y(0^+)\\exp(-t/\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec}})$. Substituting back $x(t)=1-y(t)$, we get $x(t) = 1 - (1-x(0^+))\\exp(-t/\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec}})$. Using the initial condition $x(0^+) = 1-U$:\n$$x(t) = 1 - \\bigl(1-(1-U)\\bigr)\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec}}}\\right) = 1 - U\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec}}}\\right)$$\nAt the time just before the second spike, $t_2^- = \\Delta t$, the value of $x$ is:\n$$x(t_2^-) = 1 - U\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec}}}\\right)$$\n\n**3. State at the second spike ($t_2=\\Delta t$)**\n\nNow we evaluate the state at the second spike. The amplitude $A_2$ depends on $u(t_2^+)$ and $x(t_2^-)$. We have already found $x(t_2^-)$. We now calculate $u(t_2^+)$:\n$$u(t_2^+) = u(t_2^-) + U\\bigl(1-u(t_2^-)\\bigr)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $u(t_2^-)$:\n$$u(t_2^+) = U\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{fac}}}\\right) + U\\left(1 - U\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{fac}}}\\right)\\right)$$\n$$u(t_2^+) = U + U\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{fac}}}\\right) - U^2\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{fac}}}\\right)$$\n$$u(t_2^+) = U + U(1-U)\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{fac}}}\\right)$$\nFactoring out $U$:\n$$u(t_2^+) = U\\left[1+(1-U)\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{fac}}}\\right)\\right]$$\nThe amplitude of the second postsynaptic current is:\n$$A_2 = \\alpha\\,u(t_2^+)\\,x(t_2^-) = \\alpha \\left( U\\left[1+(1-U)\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{fac}}}\\right)\\right] \\right) \\left( 1 - U\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec}}}\\right) \\right)$$\n\n**4. Analytical expression for the Paired-Pulse Ratio (PPR)**\n\nWe can now compute the ratio $\\mathrm{PPR} = A_2/A_1$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{PPR} = \\frac{A_2}{A_1} = \\frac{\\alpha U\\left[1+(1-U)\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{fac}}}\\right)\\right] \\left[ 1 - U\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec}}}\\right) \\right]}{\\alpha U}\n$$\nThe terms $\\alpha$ and $U$ cancel, yielding the final analytical expression for the paired-pulse ratio:\n$$\n\\mathrm{PPR} = \\left[1+(1-U)\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{fac}}}\\right)\\right] \\left[ 1 - U\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec}}}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nThe first bracketed term represents the effect of facilitation (increase in release probability), while the second term represents depression (depletion of available resources).\n\n**5. Numerical Evaluation and Interpretation**\n\nWe are given the parameters: $U=0.05$, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec}}=500\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{fac}}=400\\,\\mathrm{ms}$, and $\\Delta t=20\\,\\mathrm{ms}$. The units of time ($ms$) are consistent and cancel in the exponents.\n\nFirst, we evaluate the exponential terms:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{fac}}}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{20}{400}\\right) = \\exp(-0.05) \\approx 0.951229\n$$\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec}}}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{20}{500}\\right) = \\exp(-0.04) \\approx 0.960789\n$$\nNow we substitute these values into the PPR expression.\n\nThe facilitation term (first bracket):\n$$\n1+(1-U)\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{fac}}}\\right) = 1+(1-0.05)\\,\\exp(-0.05) = 1 + 0.95 \\times 0.951229 \\approx 1 + 0.903668 = 1.903668\n$$\nThe depression term (second bracket):\n$$\n1-U\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rec}}}\\right) = 1-0.05\\,\\exp(-0.04) = 1 - 0.05 \\times 0.960789 \\approx 1 - 0.048039 = 0.951961\n$$\nMultiplying these two terms gives the PPR:\n$$\n\\mathrm{PPR} \\approx 1.903668 \\times 0.951961 \\approx 1.812235\n$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, we get $\\mathrm{PPR} \\approx 1.812$.\n\nSince $\\mathrm{PPR} > 1$, the amplitude of the second pulse is greater than the first. This indicates that the synapse exhibits **short-term facilitation** under this specific protocol and parameter set. The increase in release probability (facilitation) dominates the depletion of synaptic resources (depression) for this short inter-spike interval.",

The parameter $U$, representing the baseline fraction of resources used per spike, is a probability and thus lies in the range $0 \\le U \\le 1$. For a functional synapse, $U > 0$. Therefore, the $\\mathrm{PPR}$ is less than $1$ (i.e., $1-U  1$). A $\\mathrm{PPR}  1$ indicates that the response to the second spike is weaker than the response to the first, a phenomenon known as Paired-Pulse Depression (PPD).\n\nIn the specified asymptotic regime:\n- The condition $\\tau_{fac} \\ll \\Delta t$ means that facilitation dynamics are too fast to have an effect. The utilization variable $u$ returns to its baseline $U$ before the second spike arrives ($u_2 \\approx u_1$), so there is no paired-pulse facilitation.\n- The condition $\\tau_{rec} \\gg \\Delta t$ means that resource recovery is too slow to have an effect. The resources depleted by the first spike, a fraction $U$ of the total, are not replenished before the second spike arrives. The resource level drops from $R_1=1$ to $R_2 \\approx 1-U$.\n\nConsequently, the change in the postsynaptic response is dominated entirely by the depression of available synaptic resources. The system exhibits pure paired-pulse depression, and the magnitude of this depression is determined solely by the baseline utilization parameter $U$.",
