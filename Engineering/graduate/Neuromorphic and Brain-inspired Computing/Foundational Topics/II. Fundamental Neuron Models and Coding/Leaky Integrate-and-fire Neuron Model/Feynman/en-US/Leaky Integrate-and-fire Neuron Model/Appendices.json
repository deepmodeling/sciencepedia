The given equation is:\n$$C\\,\\frac{dV(t)}{dt}=-g_{L}\\big(V(t)-E_{L}\\big)+I_{0}$$\nWe can rearrange this equation by dividing by $g_{L}$:\n$$\\frac{C}{g_{L}}\\frac{dV}{dt} = -\\big(V(t)-E_{L}\\big) + \\frac{I_{0}}{g_{L}}$$\nLet us define the membrane time constant $\\tau_{m} = C/g_{L}$ and the steady-state voltage (or reversal potential of the total current) $V_{\\infty} = E_{L} + I_{0}/g_{L}$. Substituting these into the equation gives:\n$$\\tau_{m}\\frac{dV}{dt} = -(V - E_{L} - \\frac{I_{0}}{g_{L}}) = -(V - V_{\\infty})$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We can solve it by separation of variables:\n$$\\frac{dV}{V-V_{\\infty}} = -\\frac{dt}{\\tau_{m}}$$\nWe integrate this equation.

Since $h, \\tau > 0$, we have $0  a_{BE}  1$, so BE is unconditionally stable.\n\n*   **Exact Discretization:** The update rule is already in the form for deviations, $\\delta_{k+1} = e^{-h/\\tau} \\delta_k$.\n    The amplification factor is $a_{EE} = e^{-h/\\tau}$. Since $h, \\tau > 0$, we have $0  a_{EE}  1$, so EE is also unconditionally stable.",
