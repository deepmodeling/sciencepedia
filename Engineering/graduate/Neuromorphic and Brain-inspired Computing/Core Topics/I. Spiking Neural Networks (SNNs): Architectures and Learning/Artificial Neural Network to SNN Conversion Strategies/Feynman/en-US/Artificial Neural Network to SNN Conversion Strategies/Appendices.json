            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the established theory of the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron model, a cornerstone of computational neuroscience. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and a clear objective. The parameters are physically realistic, and the supra-threshold condition $R I > V_{th} - V_{rest}$ is satisfied, ensuring a meaningful, sustained firing activity. With $R = 100\\,\\mathrm{M}\\Omega$, $I = 0.4\\,\\mathrm{nA}$, $V_{th} = 20\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, and $V_{rest} = 0\\,\\mathrm{V}$, we have $R I = (100 \\times 10^6\\,\\Omega)(0.4 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{A}) = 0.04\\,\\mathrm{V} = 40\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, and $V_{th} - V_{rest} = 20\\,\\mathrm{mV} - 0\\,\\mathrm{V} = 20\\,\\mathrm{mV}$. Since $40\\,\\mathrm{mV} > 20\\,\\mathrm{mV}$, the condition holds. We may therefore proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe first part of the task is to derive the steady-state firing rate $f(I)$ for a LIF neuron with an absolute refractory period, driven by a constant current $I$. The dynamics of the membrane potential $V(t)$ are governed by the given current-balance equation:\n$$\nC \\frac{dV}{dt} = -\\frac{V - V_{rest}}{R} + I\n$$\nWe can substitute the membrane time constant $\\tau_m = R C$ into the equation by multiplying both sides by $R$:\n$$\nR C \\frac{dV}{dt} = -(V - V_{rest}) + R I\n$$\n$$\n\\tau_m \\frac{dV}{dt} = -(V - V_{rest} - R I)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We rearrange it into a standard form:\n$$\n\\frac{dV}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_m} V = \\frac{V_{rest} + R I}{\\tau_m}\n$$\nThe general solution for an equation of the form $\\frac{dy}{dt} + p(t)y = q(t)$ can be found using an integrating factor. Here, the solution for $V(t)$ is:\n$$\nV(t) = (V_{rest} + R I) + A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_m}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $A$ is a constant of integration determined by the initial conditions.\n\nThe neuron's firing cycle consists of two phases: an absolute refractory period $\\tau_{ref}$ during which the potential is clamped at $V_{reset}$ and dynamics are halted, followed by an integration phase where the potential evolves from $V_{reset}$ towards $V_{th}$. Let us define the time $t=0$ as the moment the neuron exits the refractory period. Thus, the initial condition for the integration phase is $V(0) = V_{reset}$. We use this to solve for $A$:\n$$\nV(0) = V_{reset} = (V_{rest} + R I) + A \\exp(0) \\implies A = V_{reset} - V_{rest} - R I\n$$\nSubstituting $A$ back into the general solution gives the specific solution for the membrane potential during the integration phase:\n$$\nV(t) = (V_{rest} + R I) + (V_{reset} - V_{rest} - R I) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_m}\\right)\n$$\nThe integration phase ends when the potential reaches the threshold $V_{th}$. Let us denote the duration of this phase as $t_{rise}$. At $t = t_{rise}$, we have $V(t_{rise}) = V_{th}$:\n$$\nV_{th} = (V_{rest} + R I) + (V_{reset} - V_{rest} - R I) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t_{rise}}{\\tau_m}\\right)\n$$\nWe now solve for $t_{rise}$.

The activations in an ANN (and thus the target firing rates in the SNN) change dynamically in response to time-varying input. An input signal would almost certainly change significantly over a one-second interval, meaning the underlying rate is not constant. Therefore, the model itself becomes a poor approximation for dynamic inputs, suggesting that this simple rate-coding scheme is inadequate for applications requiring both high precision and responsiveness.
