            "problem": "Consider a single-rate neuron driven by one presynaptic channel with activity $x(t)$ and one synaptic weight $w(t)$. Assume a rate-coded postsynaptic response $y(t)$ that is linearly proportional to the net input, $y(t)=w(t)\\,x(t)$, and that the synaptic weight is constrained by a projection to the nonnegative orthant, $w(t)\\geq 0$, as is common in rectifying neuromorphic circuits. Let $x(t)\\equiv x0$ be constant over the time scale of synaptic changes. The Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro (BCM) learning rule (Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro (BCM)) for the synaptic weight is defined by an activity-gated update of the form $\\dot{w}(t)=\\eta\\,x(t)\\,y(t)\\big(y(t)-\\theta\\big)$, where $\\eta0$ is a learning-rate constant and $\\theta0$ is a fixed, small threshold parameter with the same units as $y(t)$. Starting from the assumptions of rate coding, nonnegativity of $w(t)$, and the BCM update structure above, derive the autonomous differential equation for $w(t)$ and perform a sign analysis of its right-hand side to identify the unique nonzero critical weight $w_{\\mathrm{c}}$ at which the plasticity switches from depression to potentiation. Use this sign analysis to justify that, for a fixed small $\\theta$, the BCM rule approximates a thresholded Hebbian rule that depresses synapses when the postsynaptic activity is low (that is, when $y(t)\\theta$) and potentiates when $y(t)\\theta$. Provide the closed-form analytic expression for the switching weight $w_{\\mathrm{c}}$ in terms of $x$ and $\\theta$ as your final answer. No numerical approximation is required.",
            "solution": "The problem provides the Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro (BCM) learning rule for a synaptic weight $w(t)$ and asks for the derivation and analysis of its dynamics under specific conditions. We begin by stating the given equations and constraints.\n\nThe postsynaptic response $y(t)$ is linearly proportional to the presynaptic input $x(t)$ and the synaptic weight $w(t)$:\n$$y(t) = w(t) x(t)$$\nThe synaptic weight is constrained to be non-negative:\n$$w(t) \\ge 0$$\nThe presynaptic input is assumed to be constant and positive:\n$$x(t) \\equiv x, \\quad \\text{with } x > 0$$\nUnder this condition, the postsynaptic response simplifies to:\n$$y(t) = w(t) x$$\nThe BCM learning rule is given by:\n$$\\dot{w}(t) = \\eta \\, x(t) \\, y(t) \\big(y(t) - \\theta\\big)$$\nwhere $\\dot{w}(t)$ is the time derivative of the weight, $\\eta > 0$ is the learning rate, and $\\theta > 0$ is a fixed activity threshold.\n\nThe first step is to derive the autonomous differential equation for $w(t)$. We substitute the expressions for $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ into the BCM rule:\n$$\\dot{w}(t) = \\eta \\, x \\, (w(t)x) \\big(w(t)x - \\theta\\big)$$\nBy rearranging terms, we obtain the autonomous ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $w(t)$, as the right-hand side depends only on $w(t)$ and not explicitly on time $t$:\n$$\\dot{w}(t) = \\eta x^2 w(t) \\big(w(t)x - \\theta\\big)$$\nLet's define the right-hand side function as $F(w) = \\eta x^2 w (wx - \\theta)$. The sign of $\\dot{w}(t) = F(w(t))$ determines whether the synapse undergoes potentiation ($\\dot{w} > 0$) or depression ($\\dot{w}  0$).\n\nNext, we perform a sign analysis of $F(w)$. The critical points (or fixed points) of the dynamics occur when $\\dot{w}(t) = 0$, which means $F(w) = 0$.\n$$\\eta x^2 w (wx - \\theta) = 0$$\nSince we are given that $\\eta > 0$ and $x > 0$, the term $\\eta x^2$ is strictly positive. Therefore, the equation is satisfied if either $w = 0$ or $(wx - \\theta) = 0$.\nThis gives two critical points:\n1. $w_1 = 0$\n2. $wx - \\theta = 0 \\implies w_2 = \\frac{\\theta}{x}$\n\nThe problem asks for the unique nonzero critical weight $w_{\\mathrm{c}}$ where plasticity switches from depression to potentiation. This corresponds to $w_2$.\n$$w_{\\mathrm{c}} = \\frac{\\theta}{x}$$\nSince $\\theta > 0$ and $x > 0$, $w_{\\mathrm{c}}$ is a positive weight, consistent with the constraint $w(t) \\ge 0$.\n\nNow we analyze the sign of $\\dot{w}$ in the regions defined by these critical points for $w > 0$. The sign of $\\dot{w} = \\eta x^2 w (wx - \\theta)$ is determined by the sign of the term $(wx - \\theta)$, because $\\eta x^2 > 0$ and we are considering $w > 0$.\n\nCase 1: Depression ($\\dot{w}  0$).\nThis occurs when $(wx - \\theta)  0$, which implies $wx  \\theta$. Solving for $w$ gives:\n$$w  \\frac{\\theta}{x} \\implies w  w_{\\mathrm{c}}$$\nSo, for any weight $w$ in the interval $0  w  w_{\\mathrm{c}}$, the synapse will weaken ($\\dot{w}  0$).\n\nCase 2: Potentiation ($\\dot{w} > 0$).\nThis occurs when $(wx - \\theta) > 0$, which implies $wx > \\theta$. Solving for $w$ gives:\n$$w > \\frac{\\theta}{x} \\implies w > w_{\\mathrm{c}}$$\nFor any weight $w > w_{\\mathrm{c}}$, the synapse will strengthen ($\\dot{w} > 0$).\n\nThis sign analysis justifies the interpretation of the BCM rule as a thresholded Hebbian rule. The post-synaptic activity is $y = wx$. The condition for switching from depression to potentiation, $w = w_{\\mathrm{c}} = \\frac{\\theta}{x}$, is equivalent to the postsynaptic activity reaching the threshold:\n$$y = w_{\\mathrm{c}}x = \\left(\\frac{\\theta}{x}\\right)x = \\theta$$\nThus, the BCM rule implements the following logic:\n- If postsynaptic activity is low ($y  \\theta$), the synapse depresses. This corresponds to Long-Term Depression (LTD).\n- If postsynaptic activity is high ($y > \\theta$), the synapse potentiates. This corresponds to Long-Term Potentiation (LTP).\n\nThe Hebbian character of the rule is evident from the multiplicative dependence on presynaptic ($x$) and postsynaptic ($y$) activity in the term $\\eta x y$. The factor $(y - \\theta)$ introduces the threshold that governs the direction of plasticity, making it a \"thresholded Hebbian rule\". The critical weight $w_{\\mathrm{c}}$ is the specific weight value at which, for a given input $x$, the postsynaptic response $y$ equals the threshold $\\theta$, marking the boundary between depression and potentiation.\n\nThe final answer required is the closed-form analytic expression for this switching weight $w_{\\mathrm{c}}$. As derived from the analysis of the critical points of the autonomous ODE, this expression is:\n$$w_{\\mathrm{c}} = \\frac{\\theta}{x}$$",

Since $\\tau_{\\theta}  0$, the first term containing the initial condition $\\theta(t_0)$ decays to zero, assuming $\\theta(t_0)$ is finite. The steady-state solution $\\theta_{ss}(t)$ is therefore:\n$$ \\theta_{ss}(t) = \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\theta}}\\int_{-\\infty}^{t} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t-s}{\\tau_{\\theta}}\\right)y(s)^{2} ds $$\nThis expression represents $\\theta(t)$ as a causal functional of the process $y(\\cdot)$.

The distribution of $\\theta(t)$ is thus the distribution of this weighted moving average of the past values of the process $y(t)^2$.\n\nSecond, we establish the relationship between the steady-state expectation $\\mathbb{E}[\\theta]$ and $\\mathbb{E}[y^{2}]$. Since $y(t)$ is a stationary process, the process $y(t)^2$ is also stationary. This means the expectation $\\mathbb{E}[y(s)^2]$ is constant for all $s$. Let us denote this constant value by $\\mathbb{E}[y^2]$. Taking the expectation of the steady-state solution $\\theta_{ss}(t)$:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[\\theta_{ss}(t)] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[ \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\theta}}\\int_{-\\infty}^{t} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t-s}{\\tau_{\\theta}}\\right)y(s)^{2} ds \\right] $$\nBy the linearity of expectation and Fubini's theorem, we can interchange the expectation and integral operators:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[\\theta_{ss}(t)] = \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\theta}}\\int_{-\\infty}^{t} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t-s}{\\tau_{\\theta}}\\right)\\mathbb{E}[y(s)^{2}] ds $$\nSubstituting the constant expectation $\\mathbb{E}[y^2]$:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[\\theta_{ss}(t)] = \\mathbb{E}[y^2] \\left( \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\theta}}\\int_{-\\infty}^{t} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t-s}{\\tau_{\\theta}}\\right) ds \\right) $$\nLet's evaluate the integral. Let $u = t-s$, so $du = -ds$. The limits of integration become $u=\\infty$ for $s=-\\infty$ and $u=0$ for $s=t$.\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\theta}}\\int_{\\infty}^{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{u}{\\tau_{\\theta}}\\right) (-du) = \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\theta}}\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{u}{\\tau_{\\theta}}\\right) du = \\left[ -\\exp\\left(-\\frac{u}{\\tau_{\\theta}}\\right) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} = -0 - (-1) = 1 $$\nThe integral of the filter's impulse response is $1$. In steady-state, the statistics of $\\theta(t)$ are time-invariant, so we denote its expectation as $\\mathbb{E}[\\theta]$. Thus, we find:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[\\theta] = \\mathbb{E}[y^2] \\cdot 1 = \\mathbb{E}[y^2] $$\nAlternatively, as requested, we can use the ergodic theorem. Taking the time average of the original ODE over an interval $[0, T]$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} \\tau_{\\theta} \\dot{\\theta}(t) dt = \\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} y(t)^2 dt - \\frac{1}{T}\\int_{0}^{T} \\theta(t) dt $$\n$$ \\frac{\\tau_{\\theta}}{T}(\\theta(T) - \\theta(0)) = \\langle y^2 \\rangle_T - \\langle \\theta \\rangle_T $$\nwhere $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle_T$ denotes the time average. As $T \\to \\infty$, for a stable system where $\\theta(t)$ is bounded, the term $\\frac{\\theta(T) - \\theta(0)}{T} \\to 0$. This gives $\\lim_{T \\to \\infty} \\langle \\theta \\rangle_T = \\lim_{T \\to \\infty} \\langle y^2 \\rangle_T$. Since $y(t)$ is ergodic, the output $\\theta(t)$ of the stable LTI filter is also an ergodic process. By the ergodic theorem, time averages converge to ensemble averages, so we conclude $\\mathbb{E}[\\theta] = \\mathbb{E}[y^2]$.\n\nThird, we express $\\mathbb{E}[\\theta]$ in terms of the given mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2$ of the process $y(t)$. The variance is defined as:\n$$ \\sigma^2 = \\mathbb{E}[(y(t) - \\mathbb{E}[y(t)])^2] $$\nGiven $\\mathbb{E}[y(t)] = \\mu$:\n$$ \\sigma^2 = \\mathbb{E}[(y - \\mu)^2] = \\mathbb{E}[y^2 - 2\\mu y + \\mu^2] $$\nBy linearity of expectation:\n$$ \\sigma^2 = \\mathbb{E}[y^2] - 2\\mu\\mathbb{E}[y] + \\mathbb{E}[\\mu^2] = \\mathbb{E}[y^2] - 2\\mu(\\mu) + \\mu^2 = \\mathbb{E}[y^2] - 2\\mu^2 + \\mu^2 $$\n$$ \\sigma^2 = \\mathbb{E}[y^2] - \\mu^2 $$\nThis relation provides an expression for the second moment, $\\mathbb{E}[y^2]$:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[y^2] = \\mu^2 + \\sigma^2 $$\nFinally, substituting this into our result for the steady-state expectation of the threshold:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[\\theta] = \\mu^2 + \\sigma^2 $$\nThis is the final expression for the steady-state expectation of the threshold variable, expressed solely in terms of the mean and variance of the neuron's output.",
