            "problem": "Consider a single astrocyte expressing a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that couples to phospholipase C (PLC) to generate myo-Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP$_3$). Use the following well-tested assumptions as the fundamental base: (i) receptor-ligand binding is at quasi-steady-state and follows mass-action with dissociation constant $K_D$, so the fraction of occupied receptors increases with ligand concentration $L$ and saturates; (ii) PLC activation by occupied receptors exhibits Michaelis-Menten-like saturation with a maximum cytosolic $IP_3$ production rate $V_{\\max}$ at high occupied-receptor density and a half-saturation scale $K_R$ in terms of occupied-receptor density; and (iii) cytosolic $IP_3$ is cleared by first-order degradation with rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{deg}}$.

Round the sensitivity result to $4$ significant figures and report only this value.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated against the validation criteria.\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem describes a simplified but standard and well-established model of intracellular signaling, specifically the GPCR-PLC-IP$_3$ pathway. The assumptions of quasi-steady-state receptor binding (Hill-Langmuir equation), Michaelis-Menten kinetics for enzyme (PLC) activation, and first-order degradation are canonical in biochemical modeling. The context of astrocyte signaling is a valid and active area of research in computational neuroscience.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined. It provides all necessary parameters and a set of consistent assumptions to derive a unique mathematical model. The tasks—deriving a steady-state concentration and its sensitivity—are standard analytical procedures for such a model. A unique and meaningful solution exists.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, quantitative, and unbiased language. There are no subjective or opinion-based components.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any of the flaws listed (Scientific Unsoundness, Non-Formalizable, Incomplete/Contradictory, Unrealistic, Ill-Posed, Pseudo-Profound, or Outside Scientific Verifiability). All parameters have consistent units (or are dimensionless where appropriate), and the model is physically and biologically plausible within its scope.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation of the steady-state IP$_3$ concentration and its sensitivity to receptor density proceeds as follows.\n\nFirst, we model the density of occupied receptors, which we denote as $R_{occ}$. According to assumption (i), the binding of ligand $L$ to total receptors $R$ is at quasi-steady-state and follows mass-action kinetics. This is described by the Hill-Langmuir equation, where $R_{occ}$ is a fraction of the total receptor density $R$:\n$$R_{occ} = R \\frac{L}{K_D + L}$$\n\nNext, we model the rate of IP$_3$ production, $v_{prod}$. According to assumption (ii), this process follows Michaelis-Menten-like kinetics, where the occupied receptor density $R_{occ}$ acts as the \"substrate\" for PLC activation:\n$$v_{prod} = V_{\\max} \\frac{R_{occ}}{K_R + R_{occ}}$$\n\nThe degradation of IP$_3$, according to assumption (iii), is a first-order process with rate constant $k_{\\mathrm{deg}}$. Denoting the IP$_3$ concentration as $I$, the degradation rate $v_{deg}$ is:\n$$v_{deg} = k_{\\mathrm{deg}} I$$\n\nThe time evolution of the IP$_3$ concentration is given by the balance between production and degradation:\n$$\\frac{dI}{dt} = v_{prod} - v_{deg} = V_{\\max} \\frac{R_{occ}}{K_R + R_{occ}} - k_{\\mathrm{deg}} I$$\n\nAt steady state, the concentration of IP$_3$ is constant, so $\\frac{dI}{dt} = 0$. Let the steady-state concentration be $I^{\\ast}$. We have $v_{prod} = v_{deg}$:\n$$V_{\\max} \\frac{R_{occ}}{K_R + R_{occ}} = k_{\\mathrm{deg}} I^{\\ast}$$\nSolving for $I^{\\ast}$ gives:\n$$I^{\\ast} = \\frac{V_{\\max}}{k_{\\mathrm{deg}}} \\frac{R_{occ}}{K_R + R_{occ}}$$\nTo express $I^{\\ast}$ as a function of the primary parameters, we substitute the expression for $R_{occ}$:\n$$I^{\\ast} = \\frac{V_{\\max}}{k_{\\mathrm{deg}}} \\frac{R \\frac{L}{K_D + L}}{K_R + R \\frac{L}{K_D + L}}$$\nMultiplying the numerator and denominator of the second fraction by $(K_D + L)$ simplifies the expression to:\n$$I^{\\ast} = \\frac{V_{\\max}}{k_{\\mathrm{deg}}} \\frac{RL}{K_R(K_D + L) + RL}$$\nThis is the symbolic expression for the steady-state IP$_3$ concentration.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $I^{\\ast}$ using the given parameters:\n$L = 0.30\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, $K_D = 0.15\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, $R = 500\\,\\mathrm{receptors}\\cdot\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$, $K_R = 200\\,\\mathrm{receptors}\\cdot\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$, $V_{\\max} = 1.50\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $k_{\\mathrm{deg}} = 1.00\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nFirst, we calculate the common terms:\n$$RL = (500)(0.30) = 150$$\n$$K_R(K_D + L) = 200(0.15 + 0.30) = 200(0.45) = 90$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $I^{\\ast}$:\n$$I^{\\ast} = \\frac{1.50}{1.00} \\frac{150}{90 + 150} = 1.5 \\frac{150}{240} = 1.5 \\frac{15}{24} = 1.5 \\frac{5}{8} = \\frac{3}{2} \\frac{5}{8} = \\frac{15}{16} = 0.9375\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$$\n\nThe second task is to compute the logarithmic sensitivity of $I^{\\ast}$ with respect to the total receptor density $R$, defined as $S_R = \\frac{\\partial \\ln I^{\\ast}}{\\partial \\ln R}$. Using the identity $\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial \\ln x} = x \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}$, we have $S_R = R \\frac{\\partial \\ln I^{\\ast}}{\\partial R}$.\nWe start from the expression for $I^{\\ast}$:\n$$I^{\\ast} = C \\frac{\\alpha R}{\\beta + \\alpha R}$$\nwhere $C = \\frac{V_{\\max}}{k_{\\mathrm{deg}}}$, $\\alpha = L$, and $\\beta = K_R(K_D+L)$.\nTaking the natural logarithm:\n$$\\ln I^{\\ast} = \\ln(C) + \\ln(\\alpha R) - \\ln(\\beta + \\alpha R)$$\nNow, we differentiate with respect to $R$:\n$$\\frac{\\partial \\ln I^{\\ast}}{\\partial R} = 0 + \\frac{1}{\\alpha R} \\cdot \\alpha - \\frac{1}{\\beta + \\alpha R} \\cdot \\alpha = \\frac{1}{R} - \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta + \\alpha R}$$\nMultiplying by $R$ to get $S_R$:\n$$S_R = R \\left( \\frac{1}{R} - \\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta + \\alpha R} \\right) = 1 - \\frac{\\alpha R}{\\beta + \\alpha R} = \\frac{(\\beta + \\alpha R) - \\alpha R}{\\beta + \\alpha R} = \\frac{\\beta}{\\beta + \\alpha R}$$\nSubstituting back the original parameters:\n$$S_R = \\frac{K_R(K_D + L)}{K_R(K_D + L) + RL}$$\nThis is the symbolic expression for the sensitivity. This result can also be expressed more elegantly by first calculating $R_{occ}$:\n$$R_{occ} = R \\frac{L}{K_D + L} = 500 \\frac{0.30}{0.15 + 0.30} = 500 \\frac{0.30}{0.45} = 500 \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1000}{3} \\approx 333.33\\,\\mathrm{receptors}\\cdot\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{-2}$$\nThe expression for sensitivity simplifies to:\n$$S_R = \\frac{K_R}{K_R + R_{occ}}$$\nLet's verify this simplification:\n$$S_R = \\frac{K_R(K_D + L)}{K_R(K_D + L) + R L} = \\frac{K_R}{K_R + \\frac{RL}{K_D+L}} = \\frac{K_R}{K_R + R_{occ}}$$\nThe simplified form is correct.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value for $S_R$:\nUsing the values $K_R=200$ and $R_{occ} = 1000/3$:\n$$S_R = \\frac{200}{200 + \\frac{1000}{3}} = \\frac{200}{\\frac{600+1000}{3}} = \\frac{200 \\cdot 3}{1600} = \\frac{600}{1600} = \\frac{6}{16} = \\frac{3}{8}$$\nAs a decimal, $S_R = 0.375$.\nThe problem requires rounding the result to $4$ significant figures.\n$$S_R = 0.3750$$",

            "solution": "The problem is valid. It presents a scientifically grounded, well-posed, and complete task to model and analyze astrocyte calcium dynamics using a standard biophysical model (Li-Rinzel). All necessary equations, parameters, initial conditions, and numerical procedures are clearly specified.\n\nThe model describes the temporal evolution of three state variables: the cytosolic calcium concentration, $c(t)$; the inositol $1,4,5$-trisphosphate (IP3) concentration, $p(t)$; and a variable representing the inactivation of IP3 receptor channels, $h(t)$. The dynamics are captured by a system of three coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which we will now formally describe based on the principles outlined in the problem statement.\n\nThe state vector is $\\mathbf{y}(t) = [c(t), h(t), p(t)]^T$. We seek to find the system of ODEs $\\frac{d\\mathbf{y}}{dt} = \\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{y})$.\n\n**1. Dynamics of Cytosolic Calcium ($c(t)$)**\n\nThe rate of change of cytosolic calcium concentration, $\\frac{dc}{dt}$, is determined by the principle of flux balance. It is the sum of fluxes into and out of the cytosol. The major fluxes considered are from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which acts as an internal calcium store.\n$$\n\\frac{dc}{dt} = J_{\\mathrm{chan}}(c,p,h) + J_{\\mathrm{leak}}(c) - J_{\\mathrm{pump}}(c)\n$$\nHere, $J_{\\mathrm{chan}}$ is the flux through IP3 receptor channels, $J_{\\mathrm{leak}}$ is a passive leak from the ER, and $J_{\\mathrm{pump}}$ is the active transport of calcium back into the ER by SERCA pumps.\n\nThe free calcium concentration in the ER, $c_{\\mathrm{ER}}$, is related to the cytosolic concentration $c$ through the conservation of the total calcium pool, $c_0$. Assuming a fixed total amount of calcium distributed between the cytosol and the ER, we have $c_0 = c + c_1 c_{\\mathrm{ER}}$, where $c_1$ is the ER-to-cytosol volume and buffering ratio. Rearranging this gives:\n$$\nc_{\\mathrm{ER}} = \\frac{c_0 - c}{c_1}\n$$\nThe fluxes are driven by the concentration difference $c_{\\mathrm{ER}} - c$.\n\n-   **Channel Flux ($J_{\\mathrm{chan}}$)**: This flux represents calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) and is mediated by IP3 receptors. The flux is proportional to the concentration gradient and the open probability $O(p,c,h)$ of the channels.\n    $J_{\\mathrm{chan}}(c,p,h) = v_1 O(p,c,h) (c_{\\mathrm{ER}} - c)$, where $v_1$ is a rate constant. The open probability is modeled using a reduced Li-Rinzel formulation, depending on IP3 binding ($m_{\\infty}$), calcium activation ($n_{\\infty}$), and calcium inactivation ($h$):\n    $$\n    O(p,c,h) = m_{\\infty}(p)^3 n_{\\infty}(c)^3 h^3\n    $$\n    with activation terms given by Hill functions:\n    $$\n    m_{\\infty}(p) = \\frac{p}{p + d_1} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad n_{\\infty}(c) = \\frac{c}{c + d_5}\n    $$\n\n-   **Leak Flux ($J_{\\mathrm{leak}}$)**: A passive, linear leak of calcium from the ER into the cytosol.\n    $J_{\\mathrm{leak}}(c) = v_{\\ell} (c_{\\mathrm{ER}} - c)$, where $v_{\\ell}$ is the leak rate constant.\n\n-   **Pump Flux ($J_{\\mathrm{pump}}$)**: The SERCA pump actively transports calcium from the cytosol back into the ER, with its activity described by a Hill function.\n    $J_{\\mathrm{pump}}(c) = v_p \\frac{c^2}{c^2 + k_p^2}$, where $v_p$ is the maximum pump rate and $k_p$ is the half-activation constant.\n\nCombining these terms, the first ODE for $c(t)$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{dc}{dt} = \\left( v_1 \\left(\\frac{p}{p+d_1}\\right)^3 \\left(\\frac{c}{c+d_5}\\right)^3 h^3 + v_{\\ell} \\right) \\left(\\frac{c_0 - c}{c_1} - c\\right) - v_p \\frac{c^2}{c^2 + k_p^2}\n$$\n\n**2. Dynamics of Channel Inactivation ($h(t)$)**\n\nThe variable $h(t)$ represents the fraction of IP3 receptors that are not inactivated by cytosolic calcium. Its dynamics follow first-order kinetics, relaxing towards a steady-state value $h_{\\infty}(p,c)$ with a time constant $\\tau_h(p,c)$.\n$$\n\\frac{dh}{dt} = \\frac{h_{\\infty}(p,c) - h}{\\tau_h(p,c)}\n$$\nThe steady-state inactivation $h_{\\infty}$ and the time constant $\\tau_h$ are both dependent on calcium and IP3 concentrations:\n$$\nh_{\\infty}(p,c) = \\frac{Q(p)}{Q(p) + c} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\tau_h(p,c) = \\frac{1}{a_2 (Q(p) + c)}\n$$\nwhere $a_2$ is a rate constant and $Q(p)$ represents the effective dissociation constant for calcium binding to the inactivating site, which is modulated by IP3:\n$$\nQ(p) = d_2 \\frac{p + d_1}{p + d_3}\n$$\nSubstituting these expressions gives the second ODE for $h(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dh}{dt} = a_2 (Q(p) + c) \\left( \\frac{Q(p)}{Q(p) + c} - h \\right) = a_2(Q(p) - h(Q(p)+c))\n$$\n\n**3. Dynamics of IP3 Concentration ($p(t)$)**\n\nThe concentration of IP3, $p(t)$, is modeled by a balance between production and degradation. Production includes a basal term ($v_{\\beta}$) and a calcium-dependent term representing feedback via phospholipase C-$\\delta$. Degradation is assumed to be a first-order process.\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dt} = v_{\\beta} + v_{\\delta} \\frac{c^2}{c^2 + K_{\\delta}^2} - k_{\\mathrm{deg}} p\n$$\nHere, $v_{\\beta}$ is the basal production rate, $v_{\\delta}$ is the maximal rate of calcium-dependent production, $K_{\\delta}$ is the half-activation constant for this feedback, and $k_{\\mathrm{deg}}$ is the degradation rate constant.\n\n**Numerical Simulation and Classification**\n\nThe full system of three coupled ODEs is integrated numerically to investigate its behavior under different parameter regimes. The fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method is employed for this task, with a fixed time step of $\\Delta t=0.02\\,\\mathrm{s}$ over a total duration of $T=240\\,\\mathrm{s}$. For each parameter set, the system is initialized at $c(0)=0.1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$, $h(0)=0.6$, and $p(0)=v_{\\beta}/k_{\\mathrm{deg}}$.\n\nTo classify the system's long-term behavior, an initial transient period of $T_{\\mathrm{trans}}=120\\,\\mathrm{s}$ is discarded. The amplitude of the calcium signal, $A = \\max(c) - \\min(c)$, is then computed over the analysis window $[120\\,\\mathrm{s}, 240\\,\\mathrm{s}]$. The dynamics are classified as oscillatory if the amplitude $A$ exceeds a threshold of $0.05\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$. Otherwise, the system is considered to be in a steady state.

This final practice scales up our perspective from the single cell to the network level, framing the syncytium as an information processing system. Using a simplified linear model and tools from information theory, you will investigate a fundamental computational trade-off: how should the strength of intercellular coupling be tuned to maximize the transfer of information? This exercise demonstrates how network structure can be optimized for a specific computational function, bridging cellular biophysics with systems-level analysis .",

            "problem": "Consider a network model of an astrocytic syncytium where each microdomain is represented as a node on a one-dimensional ring with periodic boundary conditions. Neighboring microdomains are coupled by gap junctions that mediate diffusive exchange. Let there be $N$ microdomains. Define the graph Laplacian $L \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N}$ for the ring such that $L_{ii} = 2$, $L_{i,i+1} = -1$, $L_{i,i-1} = -1$, with indices taken modulo $N$ to enforce periodicity. Let $I$ denote the identity matrix of appropriate size.\n\nAssume a linear time-invariant steady-state mapping from an external input field $s \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ to the astrocytic state $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$. The steady-state is defined by a balance between local clearance and diffusive coupling: $x$ satisfies $ \\alpha x - G L x = s$, where $\\alpha > 0$ is a local clearance rate and $G \\geq 0$ is a dimensionless coupling strength representing effective gap-junction conductance. Under these assumptions, the mapping from $s$ to $x$ is $x = M(G) s$, where $M(G) = (\\alpha I - G L)^{-1}$.\n\nSuppose the network is observed through additive independent Gaussian noise $n \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma_n^2 I)$, yielding $y = x + n$. The external input field $s$ is modeled as a zero-mean Gaussian random vector with covariance $\\Sigma_s \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N}$ that captures spatial correlations across the ring: $\\Sigma_s(i,j) = \\sigma_s^2 \\exp\\left(-d(i,j)/\\ell\\right)$, where $d(i,j)$ is the minimal ring distance between nodes $i$ and $j$, $\\sigma_s^2 > 0$ is the input variance, and $\\ell > 0$ is the correlation length (in units of the lattice spacing, which is set to $1$). The mutual information between $s$ and $y$ quantifies information transfer across the syncytium.\n\nYour task is to evaluate the trade-off between local microdomain independence and global coordination by optimizing the coupling strength $G$ to maximize information transfer, expressed in bits. Use the following modeling and computational requirements:\n\n- Start from fundamental definitions of linear Gaussian channels and differential entropy, and derive the mutual information $I(G)$ between $s$ and $y$ for the model described above. Then, compute $I(G)$ for a discrete set of $G$ values over a specified closed interval $[G_{\\min}, G_{\\max}]$.\n- Determine $G^* \\in [G_{\\min}, G_{\\max}]$ that maximizes $I(G)$ by evaluating $I(G)$ on a uniform grid of $K$ points in the interval. In the event of ties (multiple $G$ values with the same maximal information), select the smallest $G$ among them.\n- All computations should be done in dimensionless units. Mutual information should be internally computed in bits, but the required final output is only the optimized $G^*$ values. No physical units are required in the output.\n- Scientific realism constraint: choose $G_{\\max}$ such that the matrix $\\alpha I - G L$ is well-conditioned across the grid (for a ring, a safe choice is strictly below $\\alpha / \\lambda_{\\max}(L)$, where $\\lambda_{\\max}(L)$ is the largest eigenvalue of $L$). You must enforce numerical stability in your implementation.\n\nImplement a program that performs this optimization for the following test suite. Each test case is specified by $(N, \\alpha, \\sigma_s, \\ell, \\sigma_n, G_{\\min}, G_{\\max}, K)$:\n\n- Case $1$ (general case): $(N=8, \\alpha=1.0, \\sigma_s=1.0, \\ell=2.0, \\sigma_n=0.3, G_{\\min}=0.0, G_{\\max}=0.24, K=481)$.\n- Case $2$ (low input correlation length; favors microdomain independence): $(N=8, \\alpha=1.0, \\sigma_s=1.0, \\ell=0.2, \\sigma_n=0.3, G_{\\min}=0.0, G_{\\max}=0.24, K=481)$.\n- Case $3$ (high observation noise; favors global averaging): $(N=8, \\alpha=1.0, \\sigma_s=1.0, \\ell=2.0, \\sigma_n=1.2, G_{\\min}=0.0, G_{\\max}=0.24, K=481)$.\n- Case $4$ (larger network size): $(N=12, \\alpha=1.0, \\sigma_s=1.0, \\ell=1.5, \\sigma_n=0.5, G_{\\min}=0.0, G_{\\max}=0.24, K=481)$.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. Each entry is the optimized coupling strength $G^*$ for the corresponding test case, rounded to six decimal places, in the order listed above. For example, the output should have the form `[g_1,g_2,g_3,g_4]`, where each `g_i` is a floating-point number with exactly six digits after the decimal point.",

The largest eigenvalue is $\\lambda_{\\max} = 4$ for any even $N \\ge 2$. The matrix $\\alpha I - G L$ is positive definite if $\\alpha - G \\lambda_k > 0$ for all $k$, which requires $G < \\alpha / \\lambda_{\\max}$. For $\\alpha=1.0$, this means $G < 1.0/4 = 0.25$. The specified $G_{\\max}=0.24$ satisfies this condition, ensuring the matrix is invertible and well-conditioned throughout the search space.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all necessary information is provided. A complete solution will be developed.\n\n### Derivation of Mutual Information and Solution Methodology\n\nThe problem requires us to find the optimal coupling strength $G^*$ that maximizes the mutual information $I(s;y)$ between the input signal $s$ and the noisy observation $y$. The relationship between these quantities is defined by a linear Gaussian channel.\n\nThe system is described by the equations:\n$$x = M(G)s$$\n$$y = x + n = M(G)s + n$$\nwhere $M(G) = (\\alpha I - G L)^{-1}$. The input $s$ and noise $n$ are independent, zero-mean Gaussian random vectors with covariances $\\Sigma_s$ and $\\Sigma_n = \\sigma_n^2 I$, respectively.\n\nThe mutual information between two random vectors is given by the difference in their differential entropies: $I(s; y) = h(y) - h(y|s)$. We will compute each term.\n\n1.  **Conditional Entropy $h(y|s)$**: Conditioned on a specific input $s$, the observation $y$ is given by $y = M(G)s + n$. Since $M(G)s$ is a constant vector for a given $s$, the distribution of $y|s$ is simply a shifted version of the distribution of $n$.\n    $$y|s \\sim \\mathcal{N}(M(G)s, \\Sigma_n)$$\n    The differential entropy of a $N$-dimensional Gaussian vector with covariance $\\Sigma$ is $\\frac{1}{2}\\log_2( (2\\pi e)^N |\\Sigma| )$. Since this expression depends only on the covariance, not the mean, the conditional entropy $h(y|s)$ is constant for all $s$:\n    $$h(y|s) = \\frac{1}{2}\\log_2\\left( (2\\pi e)^N |\\Sigma_n| \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\log_2\\left( (2\\pi e)^N |\\sigma_n^2 I| \\right) = \\frac{N}{2}\\log_2\\left( 2\\pi e \\sigma_n^2 \\right)$$\n\n2.  **Unconditional Entropy $h(y)$**: The observation $y$ is a linear transformation of independent Gaussian vectors $s$ and $n$, and is therefore also a Gaussian vector. Its mean is $E[y] = E[M(G)s + n] = M(G)E[s] + E[n] = 0$. Its covariance matrix, $\\Sigma_y$, is:\n    $$\\Sigma_y = E[yy^T] = E[(M(G)s + n)(M(G)s + n)^T]$$\n    Expanding and using the independence of $s$ and $n$ ($E[sn^T] = E[ns^T] = 0$):\n    $$\\Sigma_y = E[M(G)ss^T M(G)^T] + E[nn^T] = M(G) \\Sigma_s M(G)^T + \\Sigma_n$$\n    The graph Laplacian $L$ is a real symmetric matrix, so $L=L^T$. Consequently, $M(G) = (\\alpha I - G L)^{-1}$ is also symmetric, meaning $M(G)^T = M(G)$. The expression for $\\Sigma_y$ simplifies to:\n    $$\\Sigma_y = M(G) \\Sigma_s M(G) + \\sigma_n^2 I$$\n    The entropy of $y$ is therefore:\n    $$h(y) = \\frac{1}{2}\\log_2\\left( (2\\pi e)^N |\\Sigma_y| \\right)$$\n\n3.  **Mutual Information $I(G)$**: Combining the terms, we get:\n    $$I(G) = h(y) - h(y|s) = \\frac{1}{2}\\log_2\\left( (2\\pi e)^N |\\Sigma_y| \\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\\log_2\\left( (2\\pi e)^N |\\Sigma_n| \\right)$$\n    $$I(G) = \\frac{1}{2} \\log_2\\left( \\frac{|\\Sigma_y|}{|\\Sigma_n|} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\log_2\\left( \\frac{|M(G) \\Sigma_s M(G) + \\sigma_n^2 I|}{|\\sigma_n^2 I|} \\right)$$\n    Using the identity $|cA| = c^N|A|$ for an $N \\times N$ matrix $A$, we can factor out $\\sigma_n^2$ from the numerator's determinant:\n    $$I(G) = \\frac{1}{2} \\log_2\\left( \\frac{(\\sigma_n^2)^N | \\frac{1}{\\sigma_n^2}M(G) \\Sigma_s M(G) + I |}{(\\sigma_n^2)^N |I|} \\right)$$\n    This simplifies to the final expression for mutual information, which is a function of the coupling strength $G$:\n    $$I(G) = \\frac{1}{2} \\log_2\\left| I + \\frac{1}{\\sigma_n^2} M(G) \\Sigma_s M(G) \\right|$$\n    The information is measured in bits due to the base-$2$ logarithm.\n\n### Computational Algorithm\n\nTo find the optimal coupling $G^*$, we will implement a numerical search over the specified grid of $G$ values. For each test case defined by the parameters $(N, \\alpha, \\sigma_s, \\ell, \\sigma_n, G_{\\min}, G_{\\max}, K)$:\n\n1.  **Initialization**: Construct the matrices that are constant for a given test case.\n    -   The $N \\times N$ circulant graph Laplacian matrix $L$ is constructed according to its definition.\n    -   The $N \\times N$ input covariance matrix $\\Sigma_s$ is constructed by first computing the ring distance matrix $d$ with elements $d_{ij} = \\min(|i-j|, N-|i-j|)$, and then applying the formula $\\Sigma_s(i,j) = \\sigma_s^2 \\exp(-d_{ij}/\\ell)$.\n\n2.  **Iterative Search**:\n    -   Generate a grid of $K$ uniformly spaced values of $G$ in the interval $[G_{\\min}, G_{\\max}]$.\n    -   Initialize `max_info` to a very small number (e.g., $-\\infty$) and `optimal_G` to $G_{\\min}$.\n    -   Iterate through each value of $G$ in the grid.\n        -   Calculate the matrix $A(G) = \\alpha I - G L$.\n        -   Compute its inverse $M(G) = A(G)^{-1}$.\n        -   Form the matrix $C(G) = I + \\frac{1}{\\sigma_n^2} M(G) \\Sigma_s M(G)$.\n        -   Compute themutual information $I(G)$. For numerical stability, this is best done using the log-determinant. Let $\\det(C(G))$ be the determinant. Then $I(G) = \\frac{1}{2 \\ln(2)} \\ln(\\det(C(G)))$. The use of a library function like `numpy.linalg.slogdet` is advised, which returns the sign and the natural logarithm of the determinant's absolute value, preventing overflow/underflow issues.\n        -   Compare the computed $I(G)$ with `max_info`. If $I(G)$ is strictly greater than `max_info`, update `max_info = I(G)` and `optimal_G = G`. This update rule correctly implements the specified tie-breaking condition of selecting the smallest $G$.\n\n3.  **Result**: The value of `optimal_G` after iterating through all grid points is the solution for the test case. This procedure is repeated for all test cases. The final results are formatted as required.",
