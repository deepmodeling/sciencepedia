            "problem": "A bipolar resistive switching titanium dioxide memristive device is modeled with a single internal state variable $w(t)$ representing the width of the oxygen-vacancy-doped low-resistance region within a film of total thickness $D$. The device has a measured low-resistance-state resistance $R_{\\mathrm{on}}$ when fully doped (that is, when $w=D$). Assume the ionic drift of oxygen vacancies governs the motion of the $w$-boundary during electrical excitation, and that during a short excitation the ionic diffusion and any field-enhanced nonlinearities are negligible. The device is driven by a rectangular current pulse train with pulse amplitude $I_{0}$, pulse width $\\tau$, and period $T$ such that $T \\gg \\tau$ and the off-time has negligible effect on $w$. The active layer has uniform cross-sectional area $A$, but $A$ is not provided.\n\nStart from the following fundamental relations and definitions only:\n- The drift velocity of charged defects is $v_{\\mathrm{d}}=\\mu_{v} E$, where $\\mu_{v}$ is the ionic mobility and $E$ is the local electric field.\n- The constitutive relation in a uniform conductor is $E=\\rho J$, where $\\rho$ is the resistivity and $J$ is the current density, with $J=i/A$ for terminal current $i$ and cross-sectional area $A$.\n- The macroscopic resistance of a uniform slab of material of length $L$ and cross-sectional area $A$ is $R=\\rho L/A$.\n\nWithout assuming any pre-given state-evolution law, derive from these bases an expression for the change in $w$ over a single current pulse, $\\Delta w$ in meters, in the small-pulse limit where $w$ does not change appreciably during the pulse.

            "solution": "The problem asks for the change in the width of the doped region, $\\Delta w$, over a single current pulse of amplitude $I_0$ and duration $\\tau$. The derivation must start from the provided fundamental relations only.\n\nThe state variable $w(t)$ represents the width of the low-resistance (doped) region. Its rate of change is determined by the velocity of the boundary between the doped and undoped regions. This velocity is the drift velocity, $v_{\\mathrm{d}}$, of the oxygen vacancies.\n$$\n\\frac{dw}{dt} = v_{\\mathrm{d}}\n$$\n\nThe problem provides the relation for the drift velocity of charged defects:\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{d}} = \\mu_{v} E\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_{v}$ is the ionic mobility and $E$ is the local electric field driving the motion. Combining these gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dw}{dt} = \\mu_{v} E\n$$\n\nThe problem is structured such that only parameters related to the doped (low-resistance) region are fully specified. The resistivity of the doped region is $\\rho_{\\mathrm{on}}$. The electric field within this uniform conductor is given by the constitutive relation $E = \\rho J$. We must interpret the \"local electric field\" $E$ driving the boundary motion. Given the provided information, the only field that can be quantified without introducing new unknown parameters (like the resistivity of the undoped region, $\\rho_{\\mathrm{off}}$) is the field within the doped region, $E_{\\mathrm{on}}$. Thus, we proceed assuming $E = E_{\\mathrm{on}}$.\n$$\nE = E_{\\mathrm{on}} = \\rho_{\\mathrm{on}} J\n$$\nwhere $J$ is the current density in the device. The current density is uniform due to the uniform cross-sectional area $A$ and is related to the terminal current $i(t)$ by $J = i(t)/A$. During the pulse, the current is constant at $i(t) = I_0$. Therefore,\n$$\nJ = \\frac{I_0}{A}\n$$\n\nSubstituting these relations into the equation for $dw/dt$, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{dw}{dt} = \\mu_{v} \\left( \\rho_{\\mathrm{on}} \\frac{I_0}{A} \\right) = \\mu_{v} I_0 \\frac{\\rho_{\\mathrm{on}}}{A}\n$$\nThis expression contains the term $\\rho_{\\mathrm{on}}/A$, which involves two unknowns, $\\rho_{\\mathrm{on}}$ and $A$. The problem states that the cross-sectional area $A$ is not provided and must not appear in the final answer. We can eliminate the ratio $\\rho_{\\mathrm{on}}/A$ using the given device parameter $R_{\\mathrm{on}}$.\n\n$R_{\\mathrm{on}}$ is the resistance of the device when it is fully doped, i.e., when the doped region extends across the entire film thickness, $w=D$. Using the formula for macroscopic resistance of a uniform slab, $R = \\rho L/A$, with resistance $R=R_{\\mathrm{on}}$, resistivity $\\rho=\\rho_{\\mathrm{on}}$, and length $L=D$:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{on}} = \\frac{\\rho_{\\mathrm{on}} D}{A}\n$$\nFrom this, we can solve for the ratio $\\rho_{\\mathrm{on}}/A$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\rho_{\\mathrm{on}}}{A} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{on}}}{D}\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute this back into the expression for $dw/dt$:\n$$\n\\frac{dw}{dt} = \\mu_{v} I_0 \\left( \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{on}}}{D} \\right)\n$$\nThis is the rate of change of the doped region's width. The problem states that we are in the small-pulse limit where $w$ does not change appreciably during the pulse. Our derived expression for $dw/dt$ is independent of $w$ and is constant for the duration of the current pulse, since $\\mu_{v}$, $I_0$, $R_{\\mathrm{on}}$, and $D$ are all constants. This is fully consistent with the small-pulse limit.\n\nTo find the total change in width, $\\Delta w$, over a single pulse of duration $\\tau$, we integrate $dw/dt$ with respect to time from $t=0$ to $t=\\tau$:\n$$\n\\Delta w = \\int_{0}^{\\tau} \\frac{dw}{dt} dt = \\int_{0}^{\\tau} \\mu_{v} \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{on}}}{D} I_0 dt\n$$\nSince the integrand is constant, the integral becomes:\n$$\n\\Delta w = \\left( \\mu_{v} \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{on}}}{D} I_0 \\right) \\int_{0}^{\\tau} dt = \\mu_{v} \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{on}}}{D} I_0 \\tau\n$$\nThis is the symbolic expression for $\\Delta w$ in terms of the given parameters, $I_0$, and $\\tau$, with the unknown area $A$ successfully eliminated.\n\nThe problem requires a closed-form analytic expression using the provided numerical values.

            "solution": "The problem is evaluated as valid, being scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The derivation of the peak temperature proceeds by solving the steady-state heat conduction equation in cylindrical coordinates for the two specified regions: the conductive filament and the surrounding oxide.\n\nThe fundamental equation governing steady-state heat conduction in a medium with an internal heat source is Fourier's law, which, in cylindrical coordinates and under the assumption of only radial temperature dependence $T(r)$, simplifies to:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r k \\frac{dT}{dr}\\right) + q''' = 0 $$\nwhere $k$ is the thermal conductivity and $q'''$ is the volumetric heat generation rate.\n\nFirst, we determine the heat generation term, $q'''$. Joule heating occurs exclusively and uniformly within the conductive filament. The total electrical resistance $R$ of the cylindrical filament of length $L$, radius $a$, and resistivity $\\rho$ is given by:\n$$ R = \\frac{\\rho L}{\\pi a^2} $$\nThe total power $P$ dissipated as heat due to the direct current $i$ is:\n$$ P = i^2 R = \\frac{i^2 \\rho L}{\\pi a^2} $$\nThis power is generated uniformly throughout the filament's volume, $V_f = (\\pi a^2)L$.

The heat equation is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r \\frac{dT_f}{dr}\\right) + \\frac{q'''}{k_f} = 0 $$\nRearranging and integrating once with respect to $r$ yields:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r \\frac{dT_f}{dr}\\right) = -\\frac{q''' r}{k_f} $$\n$$ r \\frac{dT_f}{dr} = -\\frac{q''' r^2}{2 k_f} + C_1 $$\nDue to radial symmetry, the temperature gradient at the center must be zero, i.e., $\\frac{dT_f}{dr}|_{r=0} = 0$.

At the end of the pulse, the current is sampled as\n$$ i_{\\mathrm{end}} = \\frac{A}{R\\left(w_N\\right)}. $$\n\nThe prediction model uses the calibrated parameters:\n- $R_{\\mathrm{on}} = 1000 \\, \\Omega$,\n- $R_{\\mathrm{off}} = 100000 \\, \\Omega$,\n- $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{pos}} = 80 \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\, \\mathrm{V}^{-1}$,\n- $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{neg}} = 60 \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\, \\mathrm{V}^{-1}$,\n- $V_{\\mathrm{th,pos}} = 0.9 \\, \\mathrm{V}$,\n- $V_{\\mathrm{th,neg}} = 0.9 \\, \\mathrm{V}$.\n\nThe synthetic experimental currents are generated with the true parameters:\n- $R_{\\mathrm{on,true}} = 1200 \\, \\Omega$,\n- $R_{\\mathrm{off,true}} = 90000 \\, \\Omega$,\n- $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{pos,true}} = 100 \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\, \\mathrm{V}^{-1}$,\n- $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{neg,true}} = 50 \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\, \\mathrm{V}^{-1}$,\n- $V_{\\mathrm{th,pos,true}} = 0.85 \\, \\mathrm{V}$,\n- $V_{\\mathrm{th,neg,true}} = 0.95 \\, \\mathrm{V}$.\nWe add zero-mean Gaussian noise with standard deviation $\\sigma = 5 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\mathrm{A}$ using a fixed random seed $42$ to ensure reproducibility:\n$$ i_{\\mathrm{exp}}^{(k)} = i_{\\mathrm{true}}^{(k)} + \\epsilon^{(k)}, \\quad \\epsilon^{(k)} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2). $$\n\nFor each test case, we simulate both the prediction model and the true model under the same pulse sequence, starting from the specified initial condition $w_0$. Currents are sampled at the end of each pulse for both models, and the error metrics are computed:\n$$ \\mathrm{RMSE} = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\left( i_{\\mathrm{pred}}^{(k)} - i_{\\mathrm{exp}}^{(k)} \\right)^2 }, \\quad\n\\mathrm{MAE} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=1}^{N} \\left| i_{\\mathrm{pred}}^{(k)} - i_{\\mathrm{exp}}^{(k)} \\right|. $$\n\nThe algorithmic steps are:\n- Implement the window function $F(w)$ and the piecewise drift rule for $dw/dt$.\n- Integrate $w$ over each pulse using explicit Euler with clamping.\n- Compute current $i$ at the end of each pulse via Ohm’s law and the state-dependent resistance.\n- Generate the experimental currents with the true parameters and add deterministic Gaussian noise using the fixed seed.\n- Compute $\\mathrm{RMSE}$ and $\\mathrm{MAE}$ for each case.\n- Output a single line with the six numbers $[\\mathrm{RMSE}_1, \\mathrm{MAE}_1, \\mathrm{RMSE}_2, \\mathrm{MAE}_2, \\mathrm{RMSE}_3, \\mathrm{MAE}_3]$ in amperes.\n\nThe test suite covers:\n- A mixed-polarity sequence including sub-threshold pulses to validate threshold behavior and reversibility (Case $1$),\n- Strong positive pulses driving saturation to $w \\approx 1$ and a sub-threshold negative pulse to test boundary clamping and window suppression (Case $2$),\n- Mostly sub-threshold pulses with one near-threshold negative pulse to test sensitivity around the threshold (Case $3$).\n\nThis principle-based derivation aligns with the physics of resistive switching devices and yields a compact model suitable for neuromorphic validation via predictive accuracy metrics in amperes.",
