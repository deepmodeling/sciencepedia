The model is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem provides a second-order linear ordinary differential equation (as will be derived) with two boundary conditions (a current injection condition at $x=0$ and a boundedness condition at $x \\to \\infty$). This is sufficient to specify a unique and stable solution.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, unambiguous technical language.\n4.  **Flaw Checklist**: The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria. It is scientifically sound, formalizable, complete, physically plausible within its modeling assumptions, and well-posed.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. The solution process will proceed.\n\nWe begin by establishing the differential equation governing the steady-state voltage $V(x)$ along the cable. Consider an infinitesimal segment of the cable of length $dx$ at position $x$.\n\nLet $V(x)$ be the intracellular voltage at position $x$ relative to a ground potential outside the cable. Let $I_{ax}(x)$ be the axial current flowing in the positive $x$ direction inside the cable.\n\nAccording to Ohm's law, the voltage drop $dV$ across the axial resistance of the segment, which is $r_i dx$, is given by:\n$$dV = -I_{ax}(x) (r_i dx)$$\nIn differential form, this expresses the relationship between the axial current and the voltage gradient:\n$$I_{ax}(x) = -\\frac{1}{r_i}\\frac{dV}{dx} \\quad (1)$$\n\nNext, we apply the principle of current conservation to the infinitesimal segment. The change in axial current over the length $dx$, which is $dI_{ax} = I_{ax}(x+dx) - I_{ax}(x)$, must be equal to the current that leaks out through the membrane of that segment. The membrane current is denoted by $I_m$.\nThe current leaving through the membrane of the segment is given by Ohm's law, where the voltage across the membrane is $V(x)$ and the resistance of the membrane segment is $r_m/dx$. The current leaving is thus $I_m = \\frac{V(x)}{r_m/dx} = \\frac{V(x)}{r_m} dx$.\nBy conservation of current, the current entering the segment at $x$ must equal the sum of the current leaving at $x+dx$ and the current leaking through the membrane:\n$$I_{ax}(x) = I_{ax}(x+dx) + \\frac{V(x)}{r_m}dx$$\nRearranging and taking the limit as $dx \\to 0$, we get:\n$$-\\frac{I_{ax}(x+dx) - I_{ax}(x)}{dx} = \\frac{V(x)}{r_m}$$\nThis yields the second differential relationship:\n$$-\\frac{dI_{ax}}{dx} = \\frac{V(x)}{r_m} \\quad (2)$$\n\nTo obtain a single equation for $V(x)$, we differentiate equation (1) with respect to $x$:\n$$\\frac{dI_{ax}}{dx} = -\\frac{1}{r_i}\\frac{d^2V}{dx^2}$$\nSubstituting this into equation (2) gives:\n$$- \\left(-\\frac{1}{r_i}\\frac{d^2V}{dx^2}\\right) = \\frac{V(x)}{r_m}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{r_i}\\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} = \\frac{V(x)}{r_m}$$\nRearranging this equation gives the steady-state cable equation:\n$$\\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} - \\frac{r_i}{r_m}V(x) = 0$$\nUsing the provided definition of the length constant, $\\lambda = \\sqrt{r_m/r_i}$, we have $\\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} = \\frac{r_i}{r_m}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\\frac{d^2V}{dx^2} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2}V(x) = 0$$\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation. The characteristic equation is $k^2 - \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2} = 0$, which has roots $k = \\pm \\frac{1}{\\lambda}$. The general solution is therefore:\n$$V(x) = A \\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right) + B \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are constants to be determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nThe first boundary condition is that the voltage remains bounded as $x \\to \\infty$. The term $A \\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$ grows without bound as $x \\to \\infty$ (since $\\lambda  0$). To satisfy the boundary condition, its coefficient must be zero, so $A=0$. The solution simplifies to:\n$$V(x) = B \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\n\nThe second boundary condition is that a current $I_0$ is injected at $x=0$. This injected current must equal the axial current moving away from the injection site, i.e., $I_{ax}(0) = I_0$. We use equation (1) to relate $I_{ax}$ to $V(x)$:\n$$I_{ax}(x) = -\\frac{1}{r_i}\\frac{dV}{dx}$$\nFirst, we compute the derivative of our simplified solution for $V(x)$:\n$$\\frac{dV}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left[B \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)\\right] = -\\frac{B}{\\lambda}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $I_{ax}(x)$:\n$$I_{ax}(x) = -\\frac{1}{r_i}\\left(-\\frac{B}{\\lambda}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{B}{r_i \\lambda}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nNow we apply the boundary condition at $x=0$:\n$$I_0 = I_{ax}(0) = \\frac{B}{r_i \\lambda}\\exp(0) = \\frac{B}{r_i \\lambda}$$\nWe can now solve for the constant $B$:\n$$B = I_0 r_i \\lambda$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $B$ back into the solution for $V(x)$:\n$$V(x) = (I_0 r_i \\lambda) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nThe final step is to express this result using only the given parameters $I_0$, $\\lambda$, and $Z_0$. We have the definitions $\\lambda = \\sqrt{r_m/r_i}$ and $Z_0 = \\sqrt{r_m r_i}$. Let's examine the term $r_i \\lambda$:\n$$r_i \\lambda = r_i \\sqrt{\\frac{r_m}{r_i}} = \\sqrt{r_i^2 \\frac{r_m}{r_i}} = \\sqrt{r_i r_m}$$\nThis is identical to the definition of the characteristic impedance, $Z_0$. Therefore, $r_i \\lambda = Z_0$.\n\nSubstituting $Z_0$ for $r_i \\lambda$ in our expression for $V(x)$ yields the final answer:\n$$V(x) = I_0 Z_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\lambda}\\right)$$\nThis expression for the steady-state voltage profile $V(x)$ is in terms of only the specified quantities $I_0$, $Z_0$, and $\\lambda$.",

Fixed Points, Stability, and Saddle-Node Bifurcation**\n\nA fixed point, or steady state, of the system is a voltage $V_{fp}$ where the net current is zero, meaning the voltage does not change over time. This is given by the condition $\\frac{dV}{dt} = 0$, which is equivalent to $f(V_{fp}) = 0$.\n\nThe linear stability of a fixed point $V_{fp}$ is determined by the sign of the derivative of $f(V)$ evaluated at that point, $f'(V_{fp})$.

The total current is given by:\n$$\nI(V; g_L, g_{NMDA}, R_{neck}) = g_L \\left(V - E_L\\right) + g_{NMDA}\\, s(V)\\, \\left(V - E_{NMDA}\\right) + \\frac{V - V_s}{R_{neck}}\n$$\nThe local slope conductance is the derivative of the total current with respect to the membrane potential $V$:\n$$\nG(V; g_L, g_{NMDA}, R_{neck}) = \\frac{dI}{dV} = g_L + \\frac{1}{R_{neck}} + \\frac{d}{dV} \\left( g_{NMDA}\\, s(V)\\, (V - E_{NMDA}) \\right)\n$$\nUsing the product rule for differentiation, we get:\n$$\nG(V; \\mathbf{p}) = g_L + \\frac{1}{R_{neck}} + g_{NMDA} \\left( \\frac{ds(V)}{dV}(V - E_{NMDA}) + s(V) \\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{p}$ denotes the parameter vector $(g_L, g_{NMDA}, R_{neck})$.\n\nThe NMDA activation function is $s(V) = (1 + \\gamma \\exp(-\\eta V))^{-1}$. Its first derivative with respect to $V$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{ds}{dV} = -(1 + \\gamma \\exp(-\\eta V))^{-2} \\cdot (-\\eta\\gamma \\exp(-\\eta V)) = \\eta \\frac{\\gamma \\exp(-\\eta V)}{(1 + \\gamma \\exp(-\\eta V))^2}\n$$\nThis can be expressed compactly in terms of $s(V)$. Since $s(V) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\gamma \\exp(-\\eta V)}$ and $1-s(V) = \\frac{\\gamma \\exp(-\\eta V)}{1 + \\gamma \\exp(-\\eta V)}$, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{ds}{dV} = \\eta \\cdot s(V) \\cdot (1-s(V))\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $G(V)$, we get:\n$$\nG(V; \\mathbf{p}) = g_L + \\frac{1}{R_{neck}} + g_{NMDA} \\left[ \\eta s(V)(1-s(V))(V - E_{NMDA}) + s(V) \\right]\n$$\nThe NMDA spike threshold, $V^*$, is defined as the voltage at which this conductance vanishes for a given set of nominal parameters $\\mathbf{p}^{*} = (g_L^{*}, g_{NMDA}^{*}, R_{neck}^{*})$:\n$$\nG(V^{*}(\\mathbf{p}), \\mathbf{p}) = 0\n$$\nThis equation implicitly defines $V^*$ as a function of the parameters. To find the partial derivatives $\\frac{\\partial V^*}{\\partial p_i}$ for $p_i \\in \\{g_{NMDA}, g_L, R_{neck}\\}$, we apply the implicit function theorem:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial V^*}{\\partial p_i} = - \\frac{\\partial G / \\partial p_i}{\\partial G / \\partial V}\n$$\nAll partial derivatives are evaluated at the nominal operating point $(V^{*}, \\mathbf{p}^{*})$. The nondegeneracy condition $\\left. \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial V} \\right|_{V^*} \\neq 0$ ensures the denominator is non-zero.\n\nWe now compute the necessary partial derivatives of $G(V; \\mathbf{p})$.\n\n1.  **Numerator Derivatives (w.r.t. parameters $p_i$):**\n    -   For $p_i = g_{NMDA}$:\n        $$\n        \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial g_{NMDA}} = \\eta s(V)(1-s(V))(V - E_{NMDA}) + s(V)\n        $$\n    -   For $p_i = g_L$:\n        $$\n        \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial g_L} = 1\n        $$\n    -   For $p_i = R_{neck}$:\n        $$\n        \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial R_{neck}} = -\\frac{1}{R_{neck}^2}\n        $$\n\n2.  **Denominator Derivative (w.r.t. $V$):**\n    We need to compute $\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial V} = \\frac{dG}{dV}$.\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial V} = g_{NMDA} \\frac{d}{dV} \\left[ \\eta s(V)(1-s(V))(V - E_{NMDA}) + s(V) \\right]\n    $$\n    This requires the second derivative of $s(V)$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d^2s}{dV^2} = \\frac{d}{dV} \\left( \\eta s(V)(1-s(V)) \\right) = \\eta \\left( \\frac{ds}{dV}(1-s(V)) + s(V)(-\\frac{ds}{dV}) \\right) = \\eta \\frac{ds}{dV} (1 - 2s(V))\n    $$\n    Substituting $\\frac{ds}{dV} = \\eta s(V)(1-s(V))$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d^2s}{dV^2} = \\eta^2 s(V)(1-s(V))(1-2s(V))\n    $$\n    Now, we differentiate the term in the brackets in the expression for $\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial V}$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d}{dV} \\left[ s(V)(V-E_{NMDA}) \\right] = \\frac{ds}{dV}(V-E_{NMDA}) + s(V)\n    $$\n    The term is $\\frac{d}{dV}[g_{NMDA} (\\frac{ds}{dV}(V-E_{NMDA}) + s(V))] = g_{NMDA}[\\frac{d^2s}{dV^2}(V-E_{NMDA}) + \\frac{ds}{dV} + \\frac{ds}{dV}]$\n    So, the denominator is:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial V} = g_{NMDA} \\left[ \\frac{d^2s}{dV^2}(V - E_{NMDA}) + 2\\frac{ds}{dV} \\right]\n    $$\n    Substituting the expressions for $\\frac{ds}{dV}$ and $\\frac{d^2s}{dV^2}$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial V} = g_{NMDA} \\left[ \\eta^2 s(V)(1-s(V))(1-2s(V))(V - E_{NMDA}) + 2\\eta s(V)(1-s(V)) \\right]\n    $$\n    We can factor out common terms:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial V} = g_{NMDA} \\eta s(V)(1-s(V)) \\left[ \\eta(1-2s(V))(V - E_{NMDA}) + 2 \\right]\n    $$\n\n3.  **Assemble the Sensitivities:**\n    All expressions are evaluated at the nominal point $(V^{*}, g_L^{*}, g_{NMDA}^{*}, R_{neck}^{*})$.
