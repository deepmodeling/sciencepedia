            "problem": "A wafer-scale neuromorphic System on Chip (SoC) assembled by stitched photolithographic exposures must be planned from first principles of geometric coverage. Consider a circular silicon wafer of diameter $300\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ (radius $R=150\\,\\mathrm{mm}$). A single reticle exposure produces a rectangular field of width $w=26\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ along the $x$-axis and height $h=33\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ along the $y$-axis. To enable stitching between adjacent fields, a stitching margin of $s=1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ is reserved along each shared edge. Assume the stitching margin is implemented as an intentional overlap of neighboring fields, so that the step pitch between adjacent field centers is $p_x=w-s$ along $x$ and $p_y=h-s$ along $y$. The exposures are placed on a rectilinear grid centered at the wafer center, with field centers at $(i\\,p_x, j\\,p_y)$ for integers $i$ and $j$. Each exposure covers the axis-aligned rectangle of half-sizes $a=w/2$ and $b=h/2$ about its center.

            "solution": "First, we establish the parameters from the problem statement. The wafer has radius $R=150\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. The reticle field has width $w=26\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and height $h=33\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. The stitching margin is $s=1\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\nThe step pitches between adjacent field centers are given by:\n$$p_x = w-s = 26\\,\\mathrm{mm} - 1\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 25\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\n$$p_y = h-s = 33\\,\\mathrm{mm} - 1\\,\\mathrm{mm} = 32\\,\\mathrm{mm}$$\nThe field centers are located at coordinates $(i p_x, j p_y)$ for integers $i$ and $j$. A single rectangular field centered at $(C_x, C_y)$ extends over the domain $[C_x - w/2, C_x + w/2] \\times [C_y - h/2, C_y + h/2]$. The half-sizes of the field are $a = w/2 = 13\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ and $b = h/2 = 16.5\\,\\mathrm{mm}$.\n\n**1) Minimal grid half-indices $n_x$ and $n_y$ for axial coverage**\n\nThe problem requires deriving the minimal grid half-indices, $n_x$ and $n_y$, such that the grid of fields from $i \\in [-n_x, n_x]$ and $j \\in [-n_y, n_y]$ covers the wafer along the principal axes.\nFor the x-axis, the set of fields must cover the interval $[-R, R]$. Due to symmetry, we only need to ensure coverage up to $x=+R$. The rightmost extent of the field grid is determined by the field with index $i=n_x$. The center of this field is at $x_{n_x} = n_x p_x$, and its rightmost edge is at $x_{n_x} + w/2$. To cover the wafer edge at $x=R$, this must satisfy:\n$$n_x p_x + \\frac{w}{2} \\geq R$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$n_x (25) + \\frac{26}{2} \\geq 150$$\n$$25 n_x + 13 \\geq 150$$\n$$25 n_x \\geq 137$$\n$$n_x \\geq \\frac{137}{25} = 5.48$$\nSince $n_x$ must be an integer, the minimal value is $n_x = \\lceil 5.48 \\rceil = 6$.\n\nSimilarly, for the y-axis, the topmost edge of the field with index $j=n_y$ must be at or beyond $y=R$:\n$$n_y p_y + \\frac{h}{2} \\geq R$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$n_y (32) + \\frac{33}{2} \\geq 150$$\n$$32 n_y + 16.5 \\geq 150$$\n$$32 n_y \\geq 133.5$$\n$$n_y \\geq \\frac{133.5}{32} \\approx 4.171875$$\nSince $n_y$ must be an integer, the minimal value is $n_y = \\lceil 4.171875 \\rceil = 5$.\n\n**2) Total number of intersecting fields, $N_{\\text{total}}$**\n\nWe must count the number of integer pairs $(i, j)$ for which the corresponding rectangular field intersects the circular wafer disk, defined by $x^2 + y^2 \\leq R^2$. A rectangle and a centered circle intersect if and only if the distance from the circle's center (the origin) to the rectangle is less than or equal to the circle's radius.\nFor a rectangle centered at $(C_x, C_y) = (i p_x, j p_y)$ with half-sizes $a=w/2$ and $b=h/2$, the squared distance from the origin to the rectangle is given by:\n$$d^2 = \\left(\\max(0, |C_x| - a)\\right)^2 + \\left(\\max(0, |C_y| - b)\\right)^2$$\nThe intersection condition is $d^2 \\leq R^2$. Substituting the parameters:\n$$\\left(\\max(0, |i \\cdot 25| - 13)\\right)^2 + \\left(\\max(0, |j \\cdot 32| - 16.5)\\right)^2 \\leq 150^2 = 22500$$\nWe count the integer pairs $(i, j)$ satisfying this inequality. Due to symmetry, we can count the pairs in the first quadrant ($i \\ge 0, j \\ge 0$) and then calculate the total.\nThe total number of fields $N_{\\text{total}}$ is the sum of the field at the origin, the fields on the axes (excluding the origin), and the fields in the four quadrants (off-axis).\n$N_{\\text{total}} = 1 \\text{ (origin)} + N_{\\text{axes}} + N_{\\text{quadrants}}$.\n\nLet's find the maximum indices along the axes. For $j=0$:\n$$\\left(\\max(0, |i \\cdot 25| - 13)\\right)^2 \\leq 22500 \\implies |i \\cdot 25| - 13 \\leq 150$$\n$$|i \\cdot 25| \\leq 163 \\implies |i| \\leq \\frac{163}{25} = 6.52$$\nThe maximum integer index is $|i|_{\\text{max}} = 6$. So, there are $2 \\times 6 = 12$ fields on the x-axis (excluding origin).\n\nFor $i=0$:\n$$\\left(\\max(0, |j \\cdot 32| - 16.5)\\right)^2 \\leq 22500 \\implies |j \\cdot 32| - 16.5 \\leq 150$$\n$$|j \\cdot 32| \\leq 166.5 \\implies |j| \\leq \\frac{166.5}{32} \\approx 5.203$$\nThe maximum integer index is $|j|_{\\text{max}} = 5$. So, there are $2 \\times 5 = 10$ fields on the y-axis (excluding origin).\nOn-axis total: $N_{\\text{axes}} = 12+10=22$.\n\nNow, we count the off-axis fields ($i > 0, j > 0$).

We found these have indices $i$ from $-6$ to $6$. This is a total of $2 \\cdot 6 + 1 = 13$ fields. The number of stitches is the number of adjacent pairs, which is one less than the number of fields.\n$$S_x = 13 - 1 = 12$$\n\nFor the traversal along the y-axis ($x=0$), the relevant fields are those with $i=0$. We found these have indices $j$ from $-5$ to $5$. This is a total of $2 \\cdot 5 + 1 = 11$ fields.

The probability mass function for a Poisson random variable $K$ with mean (or rate parameter) $\\lambda$ is given by:\n$$P(K=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}$$\nThe rate parameter $\\lambda$ represents the expected number of events (in this case, defects) in the specified interval (in this case, area). For a region of area $A$ and a uniform defect density $D_{0}$, the expected number of defects is $\\lambda = D_{0} A$.\n\nWe first analyze a single compute core, which has an area of $a_{\\mathrm{c}}$. The expected number of defects within a single core, denoted as $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{c}}$, is:\n$$\\lambda_{\\mathrm{c}} = D_{0} a_{\\mathrm{c}}$$\nA core is considered lost if it contains one or more defects.
