The exposures are placed on a rectilinear grid centered at the wafer center, with field centers at $(i\\,p_x, j\\,p_y)$ for integers $i$ and $j$. Each exposure covers the axis-aligned rectangle of half-sizes $a=w/2$ and $b=h/2$ about its center.

The starting point, as specified, is first principles of spatial point processes.\n\nThe statement that defects are independent and uniformly distributed over the wafer surface implies that the number of defects, $k$, within any given area $A$ follows a Poisson distribution. The probability mass function for a Poisson random variable $K$ with mean (or rate parameter) $\\lambda$ is given by:\n$$P(K=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}$$\nThe rate parameter $\\lambda$ represents the expected number of events (in this case, defects) in the specified interval (in this case, area). For a region of area $A$ and a uniform defect density $D_{0}$, the expected number of defects is $\\lambda = D_{0} A$.\n\nWe first analyze a single compute core, which has an area of $a_{\\mathrm{c}}$.
