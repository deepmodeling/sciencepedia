It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in geophysical fluid dynamics that requests a standard nondimensional analysis.

We define the geometric aspect ratio $\\delta = H/L$. Thus, $w = U\\delta w'$.\nThe advective time scale is $T = L/U$. So, $t = (L/U)t'$.\nThe buoyancy scale $B$ is derived from the buoyancy equation:\n$$ \\frac{Db}{Dt} \\sim -N^2 w \\implies \\frac{B}{T} \\sim N^2 W \\implies B \\sim N^2 W T = N^2 (U\\delta) (L/U) = N^2 (U \\frac{H}{L}) (\\frac{L}{U}) = N^2 H $$\nSo, $b = N^2 H b'$.\nFor the pressure perturbation $p'$, a key dynamical balance in large-scale flows is the geostrophic balance, where the Coriolis force balances the horizontal pressure gradient: $fU \\sim \\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\frac{P}{L}$. This suggests a pressure scale $P = \\rho_0 f U L$. So, $p' = \\rho_0 f U L p'_{\\text{nd}}$.

The coefficient of the acceleration term is:\n$$ \\frac{U^2}{N^2 L^2} = \\left(\\frac{U}{NH}\\frac{H}{L}\\right)^2 = (Fr \\cdot \\delta)^2 $$\nwhere we identify the internal Froude number: $Fr = \\frac{U}{NH}$.\nThe coefficient of the pressure gradient term is:\n$$ \\frac{fUL}{N^2 H^2} = \\frac{fL}{U} \\left(\\frac{U}{NH}\\right)^2 = \\frac{Fr^2}{Ro} $$\nSo the vertical momentum equation is:\n$$ (Fr \\delta)^2 \\frac{D'w'}{Dt'} = -\\frac{Fr^2}{Ro} \\frac{\\partial p'_{\\text{nd}}}{\\partial z'} + b' + \\text{viscous terms} $$\nThe set of canonical parameters is thus confirmed to be $\\{Ro, Fr, Re, \\delta\\}$.\n\nThe buoyancy equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{U}{L}\\frac{D'(N^2 H b')}{Dt'} = -N^2 (U\\delta w') \\implies \\frac{U N^2 H}{L} \\frac{D'b'}{Dt'} = -N^2 U \\frac{H}{L} w' $$\nThis simplifies to $\\frac{D'b'}{Dt'} = -w'$, which confirms the consistency of our scaling.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical values of the four dimensionless parameters:\n1.  Rossby number: $Ro = \\frac{U}{fL} = \\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{(10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(10^6\\,\\mathrm{m})} = \\frac{10}{100} = 0.1$.\n2.  Internal Froude number: $Fr = \\frac{U}{NH} = \\frac{10\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{(10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(10^4\\,\\mathrm{m})} = \\frac{10}{100} = 0.1$.\n3.  Reynolds number: $Re = \\frac{UL}{\\nu} = \\frac{(10\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})(10^6\\,\\mathrm{m})}{10\\,\\mathrm{m}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 10^6$.\n4.  Aspect ratio: $\\delta = \\frac{H}{L} = \\frac{10^4\\,\\mathrm{m}}{10^6\\,\\mathrm{m}} = 10^{-2} = 0.01$.\n\nFinally, we interpret the dominant balances.\nThe magnitudes are $Ro=0.1$, $Fr=0.1$, $Re=10^6$, $\\delta=0.01$.\n\n\nDominant Balances in Horizontal Momentum:\nThe nondimensional equation has the form $Ro(\\text{Inertia}) + (\\text{Coriolis}) = (\\text{PGF}) + \\frac{Ro}{Re}(\\text{Viscosity})$.\nWith $Ro=0.1$ and $Ro/Re = 10^{-7}$, the equation is approximately:\n$0.1(\\text{Inertia}) + (\\text{Coriolis}) \\approx (\\text{PGF})$.\nThe leading-order balance is between the Coriolis force and the horizontal pressure gradient force (terms of order $1$). This is the geostrophic balance. The inertial terms, scaled by $Ro = 0.1$, are an order of magnitude smaller but represent a significant correction to pure geostrophy, characteristic of ageostrophic motions.\n\nDominant Balance in Vertical Momentum:\nThe nondimensional equation has the form $(Fr \\delta)^2 (\\text{Inertia}) + \\frac{Fr^2}{Ro}(\\text{PGF}) = (\\text{Buoyancy})$.\nThe inertial coefficient is $(Fr \\delta)^2 = (0.1 \\cdot 0.01)^2 = (10^{-3})^2 = 10^{-6}$.\nThe PGF coefficient is $\\frac{Fr^2}{Ro} = \\frac{0.1^2}{0.1} = 0.1$.\nThe equation is approximately: $10^{-6}(\\text{Inertia}) + 0.1(\\text{PGF}) \\approx (\\text{Buoyancy})$.\nThe vertical acceleration is negligible. The dominant balance is between the vertical pressure gradient and buoyancy. However, their coefficients are $0.1$ and $1$, indicating a mismatch from using the geostrophic pressure scale. This ratio $P_g/B_s H = Fr^2/Ro = 0.1$, where $B_s=N^2H$ is the buoyancy scale. The hydrostatic pressure scale is $P_h \\sim \\rho_0 B_s H$. The ratio of scales is $P_g/P_h = Fr^2/Ro = 0.1$. This simply means that for the flow to be in both geostrophic and hydrostatic balance, there is a scaling relationship between the parameters. Regardless, the vertical acceleration term is orders of magnitude smaller than the other two terms, so the leading-order balance is hydrostatic balance: $-\\frac{1}{\\rho_0}\\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial z} + b \\approx 0$.\n\nRole of Viscosity:\nThe Reynolds number is very large ($Re = 10^6$), indicating that inertial forces are vastly larger than viscous forces. The viscous term in the horizontal momentum equation is scaled by $\\frac{Ro}{Re} = \\frac{0.1}{10^6} = 10^{-7}$, which is negligible compared to the inertial ($Ro=0.1$) and geostrophic ($1$) terms. Therefore, viscosity can be ignored in the dynamical balances for the bulk of this large-scale flow. Its effects would be confined to unresolved, thin boundary layers.\n\nThe four dimensionless numbers, in the requested order (Rossby, Froude, Reynolds, aspect ratio), are $0.1$, $0.1$, $10^6$, and $0.01$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the Ekman layer depth scale, $\\delta_{E}$, through nondimensional scaling of the governing equations for a specified atmospheric boundary layer. We are then asked to compute its value for given parameters and discuss its implications.\n\nThe starting point is the steady-state momentum equations for an incompressible Boussinesq fluid in a rotating frame of reference, including a viscous term modeled with a constant eddy viscosity, $\\nu$.\nThe horizontal momentum equation is:\n$$ (\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{u}_{h} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_{0}} \\nabla_{h} p - f \\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{u}_{h} + \\nu \\nabla^{2} \\mathbf{u}_{h} $$\nHere, $\\mathbf{u}_{h} = (u,v)$ is the horizontal velocity vector, $\\rho_{0}$ is a constant reference density, $p$ is the pressure, $f$ is the constant Coriolis parameter, $\\mathbf{k}$ is the unit vector in the vertical direction, and $\\nu$ is the constant eddy viscosity.\n\nThe problem specifies a horizontally homogeneous boundary layer. This implies that spatial derivatives of mean quantities with respect to horizontal coordinates $(x,y)$ are zero, i.e., $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} = 0$ and $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} = 0$. Consequently, the horizontal advection term $(\\mathbf{u}_{h} \\cdot \\nabla_{h}) \\mathbf{u}_{h} = u\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_{h}}{\\partial x} + v\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_{h}}{\\partial y}$ is zero. From the continuity equation for incompressible flow, $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{u} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} = 0$, horizontal homogeneity implies $\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} = 0$. Given the boundary condition $w(z=0)=0$, the mean vertical velocity $w$ must be zero everywhere. Thus, the vertical advection term $w\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_{h}}{\\partial z}$ is also zero. Additionally, the horizontal Laplacian term $\\nabla_{h}^{2}\\mathbf{u}_{h}$ vanishes.\n\nThe geostrophic wind, $\\mathbf{u}_{g} = (u_{g}, v_{g})$, exists aloft, outside the boundary layer where friction is negligible. It is defined by the balance between the pressure gradient force and the Coriolis force:\n$$ 0 = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_{0}} \\nabla_{h} p - f \\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{u}_{g} $$\nIn component form:\n$$ fv_{g} = \\frac{1}{\\rho_{0}}\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad -fu_{g} = \\frac{1}{\\rho_{0}}\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y} $$\nAssuming the large-scale pressure gradient is constant with height through the boundary layer, we can substitute these into the full momentum equation.\n\nWhile the assumption of horizontal homogeneity allows us to neglect the advective terms directly, the problem asks to connect this to the Rossby number. To do this, we perform a scaling analysis on the momentum equations before applying the homogeneity assumption. Let $U_{g}$ be the characteristic horizontal velocity scale, $L$ a characteristic horizontal length scale, and $H$ a characteristic vertical length scale. We introduce nondimensional variables (primed): $u = U_{g} u'$, $v = U_{g} v'$, $x = L x'$, $y = L y'$, and $z = H z'$.\nThe x-component of the momentum equation is:\n$$ u\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + v\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y} = f(v-v_{g}) + \\nu \\frac{\\partial^{2} u}{\\partial z^{2}} $$\nSubstituting the scaled variables gives:\n$$ \\frac{U_{g}^{2}}{L} \\left( u' \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial x'} + v' \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial y'} \\right) = f U_{g} (v'-v'_{g}) + \\frac{\\nu U_{g}}{H^{2}} \\frac{\\partial^{2} u'}{\\partial z'^{2}} $$\nDividing by the Coriolis term's scale, $f U_{g}$, yields the nondimensional equation:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{U_{g}}{fL} \\right) \\left( u' \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial x'} + v' \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial y'} \\right) = (v'-v'_{g}) + \\left( \\frac{\\nu}{fH^{2}} \\right) \\frac{\\partial^{2} u'}{\\partial z'^{2}} $$\nThe dimensionless group $Ro = \\frac{U_{g}}{fL}$ is the Rossby number. For large-scale atmospheric motions, $L$ is large (e.g., $1000\\,\\mathrm{km}$), making $Ro \\ll 1$. The assumption of \"horizontal homogeneity\" is a formal statement of being in this low-Rossby-number regime, where the advective acceleration is negligible compared to the Coriolis force.\n\nWith advection neglected, the governing equations for the Ekman layer simplify to a balance between the Coriolis force and the vertical viscous force (turbulent friction):\n$$ 0 = f(v-v_{g}) + \\nu \\frac{d^{2}u}{dz^{2}} \\quad \\implies \\quad -\\nu \\frac{d^{2}u}{dz^{2}} = f(v-v_{g}) $$\n$$ 0 = -f(u-u_{g}) + \\nu \\frac{d^{2}v}{dz^{2}} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\nu \\frac{d^{2}v}{dz^{2}} = f(u-u_{g}) $$\nThe Ekman layer is the region where these two forces are of comparable magnitude. The vertical scale $H$ over which this balance holds defines the layer's characteristic depth, $\\delta_{E}$. A scaling analysis shows the magnitude of the Coriolis term is $\\sim fU_{g}$ (since the velocity deviation $(u-u_g)$ is of order $U_g$), and the viscous term is $\\sim \\nu U_{g}/H^{2}$. Equating these scales:\n$$ fU_{g} \\sim \\frac{\\nu U_{g}}{H^{2}} $$\n$$ f \\sim \\frac{\\nu}{H^{2}} $$\nSolving for the scale $H$ yields the characteristic depth $\\delta_{E}$:\n$$ \\delta_{E} \\sim \\sqrt{\\frac{\\nu}{f}} $$\nTo find the precise constant of proportionality, we solve the simplified differential equations. Let $W_{d} = (u-u_{g}) + i(v-v_{g})$ be the complex velocity defect. The two momentum equations can be combined into a single equation for $W_{d}$:\n$$ \\nu \\frac{d^{2}W_{d}}{dz^{2}} - i f W_{d} = 0 $$\nThe general solution is $W_{d}(z) = C_{1} \\exp(\\lambda z) + C_{2} \\exp(-\\lambda z)$, where $\\lambda^{2} = \\frac{if}{\\nu}$. We find $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\lambda = \\sqrt{\\frac{if}{\\nu}} = \\sqrt{i} \\sqrt{\\frac{f}{\\nu}} = \\frac{1+i}{\\sqrt{2}} \\sqrt{\\frac{f}{\\nu}} = (1+i)\\sqrt{\\frac{f}{2\\nu}} $$\nThe boundary conditions are no-slip at the surface, $\\mathbf{u}_{h}(0)=0$, and the flow approaching geostrophic balance far from the surface, $\\mathbf{u}_{h}(z) \\to \\mathbf{u}_{g}$ as $z \\to \\infty$. The second condition implies the velocity defect $W_{d} \\to 0$ as $z \\to \\infty$. This requires us to discard the exponentially growing solution, so $C_{1}=0$. The solution is:\n$$ W_{d}(z) = C_{2} \\exp\\left(-(1+i)\\sqrt{\\frac{f}{2\\nu}}z\\right) = C_{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{z}{\\sqrt{2\\nu/f}}\\right) \\exp\\left(-i\\frac{z}{\\sqrt{2\\nu/f}}\\right) $$\nThe magnitude of the velocity defect decays exponentially with an e-folding scale of $\\sqrt{2\\nu/f}$. This scale is defined as the Ekman layer depth, $\\delta_{E}$.\n$$ \\delta_{E} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\nu}{f}} $$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $\\delta_{E}$ using the provided parameters: $U_{g}=10\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$, $f=10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, and $\\nu=1\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}}$.\n$$ \\delta_{E} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 1\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}}}{10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}}} = \\sqrt{2 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{m^{2}}} = \\sqrt{20000}\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\n$$ \\delta_{E} = 100\\sqrt{2}\\,\\mathrm{m} \\approx 141.421356\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, we get $\\delta_{E} \\approx 141.4\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nFinally, we address the two explanatory questions.\nThe magnitude of $\\delta_{E}$ is crucial for setting the vertical grid resolution in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. The Ekman layer is characterized by strong vertical gradients in wind speed and direction (the Ekman spiral). To accurately simulate the effects of surface friction, which decelerates the flow and causes a cross-isobaric flow that drives vertical motion (Ekman pumping), a model must resolve these gradients. This requires placing several model levels within the depth $\\delta_E$. For an Ekman depth of approximately $141\\,\\mathrm{m}$, the vertical grid spacing near the surface should be on the order of tens of meters or less to capture the boundary layer dynamics adequately. Failure to do so leads to incorrect representation of surface fluxes and the evolution of the planetary boundary layer.\n\nRegarding the dependence of $\\delta_{E}$ on $U_{g}$, the derived formula, $\\delta_{E} = \\sqrt{2\\nu/f}$, shows that within the idealized framework of this problem (constant eddy viscosity $\\nu$), the Ekman depth $\\delta_{E}$ depends only on the Coriolis parameter $f$ and the eddy viscosity $\\nu$. It is independent of the geostrophic wind speed $U_{g}$. It is important to recognize that this is a consequence of the simplifying assumption that $\\nu$ is constant. In reality, turbulent viscosity is not a constant property of the fluid but depends on the flow itself, particularly on the wind shear, which is related to $U_g$. In more advanced boundary layer parameterizations, $\\nu$ would be a function of $U_{g}$, thus introducing an indirect dependence of $\\delta_{E}$ on $U_{g}$. However, based strictly on the premises given in the problem, $\\delta_{E}$ depends only on $(f, \\nu)$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the construction and evaluation of a nondimensional parameter that compares the magnitude of inertial effects to Coriolis effects for a mesocyclone. This parameter is the Rossby number, which can be defined locally using the vertical component of the relative vorticity.\n\nWe begin with the horizontal momentum equations on an $f$-plane in a rotating reference frame, neglecting friction:\n$$\n\\frac{D\\mathbf{u}_h}{Dt} = -f\\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{u}_h - \\frac{1}{\\rho}\\nabla_h p\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{u}_h$ is the horizontal velocity vector, $\\frac{D}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u}_h \\cdot \\nabla_h)$ is the material derivative in the horizontal plane, $f$ is the Coriolis parameter, $\\mathbf{k}$ is the local vertical unit vector, $\\rho$ is the density, and $p$ is the pressure. The inertial (advective) acceleration is the $(\\mathbf{u}_h \\cdot \\nabla_h)\\mathbf{u}_h$ part of the material derivative,\n$$\n\\frac{D\\mathbf{u}_h}{Dt} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_h}{\\partial t} + (\\mathbf{u}_h \\cdot \\nabla_h)\\mathbf{u}_h\n$$\nThe problem specifies a steady flow, so $\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{u}_h}{\\partial t} = 0$. The momentum equation becomes:\n$$\n(\\mathbf{u}_h \\cdot \\nabla_h)\\mathbf{u}_h = -f\\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{u}_h - \\frac{1}{\\rho}\\nabla_h p\n$$\nLet's perform a scale analysis. Let $U$ be a characteristic horizontal velocity scale and $L$ be a characteristic horizontal length scale. The magnitude of the inertial term is scaled as:\n$$\n|(\\mathbf{u}_h \\cdot \\nabla_h)\\mathbf{u}_h| \\sim \\frac{U^2}{L}\n$$\nThe magnitude of the Coriolis term is scaled as:\n$$\n|-f\\mathbf{k} \\times \\mathbf{u}_h| \\sim f_0 U\n$$\nwhere $f_0$ is the value of the Coriolis parameter at the storm's latitude. The nondimensional parameter quantifying the ratio of inertial to Coriolis effects is the Rossby number, $Ro$:\n$$\nRo = \\frac{\\text{Inertial Force}}{\\text{Coriolis Force}} \\sim \\frac{U^2/L}{f_0 U} = \\frac{U}{f_0 L}\n$$\nThe problem requests a local measure based on the vertical vorticity. The vertical component of the relative vorticity is $\\zeta = \\mathbf{k} \\cdot (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf{u}_h)$. Its scale is $\\zeta \\sim U/L$. We can therefore express the Rossby number using the local vorticity:\n$$\nRo = \\frac{|\\zeta|}{f_0}\n$$\nThis is the desired local nondimensional parameter. We must now evaluate it at the radius of maximum wind for the given mesocyclone.\n\nFirst, we calculate the Coriolis parameter, $f_0$, at latitude $\\phi = 35^{\\circ}$. The Earth's rotation rate is $\\Omega = 7.2921159\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\n$$\nf_0 = 2\\Omega\\sin\\phi = 2(7.2921159\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}})\\sin(35^{\\circ})\n$$\nUsing the value $\\sin(35^{\\circ}) \\approx 0.573576$, we find:\n$$\nf_0 \\approx 2(7.2921159\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}})(0.573576) \\approx 8.36535 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}\n$$\nNext, we must find the vertical vorticity, $\\zeta$, from the given azimuthal wind profile, $v_{\\theta}(r) = V_{\\max}\\,\\frac{r}{R}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(1 - \\frac{r}{R}\\right)$. For an axisymmetric flow ($u_r = 0, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\theta} = 0$), the vertical vorticity in cylindrical coordinates $(r, \\theta, z)$ simplifies to:\n$$\n\\zeta(r) = \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{d(r v_{\\theta})}{dr}\n$$\nLet's compute the term $r v_{\\theta}(r)$:\n$$\nr v_{\\theta}(r) = r \\left( V_{\\max}\\,\\frac{r}{R}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(1 - \\frac{r}{R}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{V_{\\max}\\exp(1)}{R} r^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r}{R}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we differentiate this with respect to $r$:\n$$\n\\frac{d(r v_{\\theta})}{dr} = \\frac{V_{\\max}\\exp(1)}{R} \\left[ 2r\\exp\\left(-\\frac{r}{R}\\right) + r^2\\left(-\\frac{1}{R}\\right)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{r}{R}\\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d(r v_{\\theta})}{dr} = \\frac{V_{\\max}\\exp(1)}{R} r \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r}{R}\\right) \\left(2 - \\frac{r}{R}\\right)\n$$\nThe vorticity is then:\n$$\n\\zeta(r) = \\frac{1}{r} \\left[ \\frac{V_{\\max}\\exp(1)}{R} r \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r}{R}\\right) \\left(2 - \\frac{r}{R}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{V_{\\max}}{R} \\exp\\left(1 - \\frac{r}{R}\\right) \\left(2 - \\frac{r}{R}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem requires evaluating this at the radius of peak azimuthal wind. To find this radius, we set the derivative of $v_{\\theta}(r)$ with respect to $r$ to zero.\n$$\n\\frac{dv_{\\theta}}{dr} = \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(V_{\\max}\\,\\frac{r}{R}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(1 - \\frac{r}{R}\\right)\\right) = \\frac{V_{\\max}\\exp(1)}{R} \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r}{R}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r}{R}\\right)\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r}{R}\\right) + r\\left(-\\frac{1}{R}\\right)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{r}{R}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{r}{R}\\right)\\left(1 - \\frac{r}{R}\\right)\n$$\nSetting the derivative to zero gives $1 - \\frac{r}{R} = 0$, which implies $r = R$. So, the peak wind occurs at $r = R$.\n\nWe now evaluate the vorticity $\\zeta$ at $r=R$:\n$$\n\\zeta(R) = \\frac{V_{\\max}}{R} \\exp\\left(1 - \\frac{R}{R}\\right) \\left(2 - \\frac{R}{R}\\right) = \\frac{V_{\\max}}{R} \\exp(0)(1) = \\frac{V_{\\max}}{R}\n$$\nUsing the given values $V_{\\max} = 35\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$ and $R = 1.0\\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{m}$:\n$$\n\\zeta(R) = \\frac{35\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}}{1.0\\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{m}} = 0.035\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}\n$$\nThis vorticity is positive, corresponding to cyclonic rotation in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nFinally, we compute the local Rossby number at $r=R$:\n$$\nRo = \\frac{|\\zeta(R)|}{f_0} = \\frac{0.035\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}}{8.36535 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}} \\approx 418.406\n$$\nA Rossby number of this magnitude ($Ro \\gg 1$) indicates that the flow is strongly nonlinear, and the dynamics are dominated by the inertial (advective/centrifugal) terms rather than the planetary rotation (Coriolis force). The balance of forces is approximately cyclostrophic, where the inward-directed pressure gradient force balances the outward-directed centrifugal force.\n\nRounding the result to three significant figures as requested gives $418$.",
