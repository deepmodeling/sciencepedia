            "solution": "The problem asks for the analytical solution for the free-surface height perturbation $\\eta(x,y,t)$ for a single, positive-frequency inertia–gravity wave, given a specific initial form for $\\eta$ at time $t=0$. To solve this, we must first determine the properties of these waves by finding the normal modes of the linearized rotating shallow-water equations.\n\nThe governing equations are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} - f v = - g \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial x} \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} + f u = - g \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial y} \\quad (2)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial t} + H \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} \\right) = 0 \\quad (3)\n$$\n\nWe assume plane-wave solutions of the form:\n$$\nu(x,y,t) = \\Re\\{\\hat{u} e^{i(k_x x + k_y y - \\omega t)}\\}\n$$\n$$\nv(x,y,t) = \\Re\\{\\hat{v} e^{i(k_x x + k_y y - \\omega t)}\\}\n$$\n$$\n\\eta(x,y,t) = \\Re\\{\\hat{\\eta} e^{i(k_x x + k_y y - \\omega t)}\\}\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{u}$, $\\hat{v}$, and $\\hat{\\eta}$ are complex amplitudes, $\\boldsymbol{k} = (k_x, k_y)$ is the wavevector, and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency. Substituting these forms into the governing equations transforms the partial differential equations into a system of linear algebraic equations for the amplitudes. The differential operators become: $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\rightarrow -i\\omega$, $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\rightarrow ik_x$, and $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} \\rightarrow ik_y$.\n\nThe system of equations becomes:\n$$\n-i\\omega \\hat{u} - f \\hat{v} = - g (ik_x) \\hat{\\eta} \\quad (4)\n$$\n$$\n-i\\omega \\hat{v} + f \\hat{u} = - g (ik_y) \\hat{\\eta} \\quad (5)\n$$\n$$\n-i\\omega \\hat{\\eta} + H (ik_x \\hat{u} + ik_y \\hat{v}) = 0 \\quad (6)\n$$\n\nThis system can be written in matrix form as:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-i\\omega  -f  igk_x \\\\\nf  -i\\omega  igk_y \\\\\nik_x H  ik_y H  -i\\omega\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\hat{u} \\\\\n\\hat{v} \\\\\n\\hat{\\eta}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0 \\\\\n0 \\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor a non-trivial solution to exist, the determinant of the matrix must be zero.

A steady geostrophic mode with $\\omega = 0$.\n2.  Two inertia–gravity wave modes with frequencies $\\omega = \\pm \\sqrt{f^2 + gHK^2}$.\n\nThe problem specifies the excitation of a single, right-propagating inertia–gravity mode, which corresponds to the positive-frequency branch:\n$$\n\\omega = \\sqrt{f^2 + gH(k_x^2 + k_y^2)}\n$$\nFor the system to evolve purely as this single mode, the initial fields $(u(x,y,0), v(x,y,0), \\eta(x,y,0))$ must have the spatial structure of the corresponding eigenvector. We find the eigenvector by determining the relationships between $\\hat{u}$, $\\hat{v}$, and $\\hat{\\eta}$ for this value of $\\omega$.\n\nFrom equations (4) and (5), we can solve for $\\hat{u}$ and $\\hat{v}$ in terms of $\\hat{\\eta}$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-i\\omega  -f \\\\\nf  -i\\omega\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\hat{u} \\\\\n\\hat{v}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n-igk_x\\hat{\\eta} \\\\\n-igk_y\\hat{\\eta}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant of this $2 \\times 2$ matrix is $D = (-i\\omega)^2 - (f)(-f) = f^2 - \\omega^2$. Using the dispersion relation, we have $f^2 - \\omega^2 = -gHK^2$.\nSolving for $\\hat{u}$ and $\\hat{v}$ (e.g., using Cramer's rule):\n$$\n\\hat{u} = \\frac{\\det \\begin{pmatrix} -igk_x\\hat{\\eta}  -f \\\\ -igk_y\\hat{\\eta}  -i\\omega \\end{pmatrix}}{f^2 - \\omega^2} = \\frac{-ig\\hat{\\eta}(-i\\omega k_x + f k_y)}{-gHK^2} = \\frac{\\hat{\\eta}}{HK^2}(\\omega k_x + ifk_y)\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{v} = \\frac{\\det \\begin{pmatrix} -i\\omega  -igk_x\\hat{\\eta} \\\\ f  -igk_y\\hat{\\eta} \\end{pmatrix}}{f^2 - \\omega^2} = \\frac{-ig\\hat{\\eta}(-i\\omega k_y - f k_x)}{-gHK^2} = \\frac{\\hat{\\eta}}{HK^2}(\\omega k_y - ifk_x)\n$$\nThese relationships define the structure of the inertia-gravity wave mode. Any initial condition that satisfies these ratios between the field amplitudes will evolve as a pure mode without exciting other modes.\n\nThe problem states that at $t=0$, the free-surface height is a plane wave with amplitude $A_\\eta  0$ and phase $\\phi_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}$:\n$$\n\\eta(x,y,0) = A_\\eta \\cos(k_x x + k_y y + \\phi_0)\n$$\nThis can be expressed using complex notation as:\n$$\n\\eta(x,y,0) = \\Re\\{ A_\\eta e^{i(k_x x + k_y y + \\phi_0)} \\} = \\Re\\{ (A_\\eta e^{i\\phi_0}) e^{i(k_x x + k_y y)} \\}\n$$\nFrom our general plane-wave form, $\\eta(x,y,0) = \\Re\\{\\hat{\\eta} e^{i(k_x x + k_y y)}\\}$. Comparing these, we identify the complex amplitude of the free-surface height perturbation as $\\hat{\\eta} = A_\\eta e^{i\\phi_0}$.\n\nSince the initial state is constructed to be a pure eigenmode, its time evolution is simply described by the propagation of this mode with its characteristic frequency $\\omega$. The solution at any time $t \\ge 0$ is found by including the time-dependent part of the plane-wave form:\n$$\n\\eta(x,y,t) = \\Re\\{\\hat{\\eta} e^{i(k_x x + k_y y - \\omega t)}\\}\n$$\nSubstituting $\\hat{\\eta} = A_\\eta e^{i\\phi_0}$:\n$$\n\\eta(x,y,t) = \\Re\\{ A_\\eta e^{i\\phi_0} e^{i(k_x x + k_y y - \\omega t)} \\} = \\Re\\{ A_\\eta e^{i(k_x x + k_y y - \\omega t + \\phi_0)} \\}\n$$\nTaking the real part gives the final expression:\n$$\n\\eta(x,y,t) = A_\\eta \\cos(k_x x + k_y y - \\omega t + \\phi_0)\n$$\nFinally, we substitute the explicit expression for the frequency $\\omega$:\n$$\n\\eta(x,y,t) = A_\\eta \\cos\\left(k_x x + k_y y - t\\sqrt{f^2 + gH(k_x^2 + k_y^2)} + \\phi_0\\right)\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytic expression for the free-surface height perturbation for all $t \\ge 0$. The amplitude $A_\\eta$ remains constant, and the phase evolves linearly in time, consistent with the behavior of a single linear wave mode.",

The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Derivation of the Final Geostrophic State and Energy Loss\n\nThe solution is found in two parts: first, determining the final geostrophic state $\\eta_{G}(x)$, and second, calculating the initial and final energies to find the fraction of energy lost.\n\n#### Part 1: Derivation of the Geostrophic Height Field $\\eta_{G}(x)$\n\nThe key principle for finding the final adjusted state is the material conservation of linear potential vorticity (PV), $q'$. In the absence of forcing and dissipation, $Dq'/Dt = 0$. For a linear system with small displacements, this implies that the PV at a fixed point $x$ in the final state is equal to the PV at that same point in the initial state: $q'(x, \\infty) = q'(x, 0)$.\n\n1.  **Calculate the initial PV, $q'(x, 0)$**:\n    At $t=0$, we have $u(x,0)=0$ and $v(x,0)=0$. The initial vorticity is $\\zeta(x,0) = v_{x}(x,0) = 0$.\n    The initial PV is therefore:\n    $$ q'(x,0) = \\frac{\\zeta(x,0)}{H} - \\frac{f}{H^{2}}\\eta(x,0) = -\\frac{f}{H^2}\\eta_0(x) $$\n\n2.  **Characterize the final geostrophic state**:\n    The final state is steady (time-derivatives are zero) and in geostrophic balance. Let the final state variables be denoted by the subscript $G$.\n    The steady-state governing equations are:\n    $$ -f v_{G} = -g \\frac{d\\eta_{G}}{dx} \\implies v_{G}(x) = \\frac{g}{f} \\frac{d\\eta_{G}}{dx} $$\n    $$ f u_{G} = 0 \\implies u_{G}(x) = 0 $$\n    $$ H \\frac{du_G}{dx} = 0 \\quad (\\text{consistent with } u_{G}=0) $$\n    The final state is characterized by zero zonal velocity and a meridional velocity in geostrophic balance with the height field.\n\n3.  **Calculate the final PV, $q'_G(x)$**:\n    The vorticity of the final state is $\\zeta_G(x) = \\frac{dv_G}{dx} = \\frac{g}{f} \\frac{d^2\\eta_G}{dx^2}$.\n    The PV of the final state is:\n    $$ q'_G(x) = \\frac{\\zeta_G}{H} - \\frac{f}{H^2}\\eta_G = \\frac{g}{fH} \\frac{d^2\\eta_G}{dx^2} - \\frac{f}{H^2}\\eta_G $$\n\n4.  **Equate initial and final PV**:\n    Setting $q'_G(x) = q'(x,0)$:\n    $$ \\frac{g}{fH} \\frac{d^2\\eta_G}{dx^2} - \\frac{f}{H^2}\\eta_G = -\\frac{f}{H^2}\\eta_0(x) $$\n    Multiplying by $-H^2/f$ and rearranging gives:\n    $$ \\eta_G - \\frac{gH}{f^2} \\frac{d^2\\eta_G}{dx^2} = \\eta_0(x) $$\n    Using the definition of the Rossby radius of deformation, $L_D^2 = gH/f^2$, we obtain the PV inversion equation:\n    $$ \\eta_G(x) - L_D^2 \\frac{d^2\\eta_G(x)}{dx^2} = \\eta_0(x) $$\nThis is an inhomogeneous second-order ordinary differential equation. The solution can be found by convolution with the Green's function for the operator $(1 - L_D^2 d^2/dx^2)$. The Green's function $G(x)$ satisfies $G(x) - L_D^2 G''(x) = \\delta(x)$, and its solution is $G(x) = \\frac{1}{2L_D}\\exp(-|x|/L_D)$.\nThe solution for $\\eta_G(x)$ is the convolution:\n$$ \\eta_G(x) = (\\eta_0 * G)(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\eta_0(y) G(x-y) dy $$\n$$ \\eta_G(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} A\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{y^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\frac{1}{2L_D}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{|x-y|}{L_D}\\right) dy $$\nThe evaluation of this integral yields an expression involving the complementary error function, $\\text{erfc}(z) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\int_z^\\infty \\exp(-t^2)dt$:\n$$ \\eta_G(x) = \\frac{A}{2} \\exp\\left( \\frac{\\sigma^2}{2L_D^2} \\right) \\left[ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{L_D}\\right)\\text{erfc}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{2}L_D}-\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{2}\\sigma}\\right) + \\exp\\left(\\frac{x}{L_D}\\right)\\text{erfc}\\left(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{2}L_D}+\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{2}\\sigma}\\right) \\right] $$\nThis expression is in terms of the given parameters and provides $\\eta_G(x)$ in units of length (meters if all inputs are in SI units).\n\n#### Part 2: Fraction of Energy Lost\nTo find the fraction of energy lost, $F = 1 - E_G/E_0$, we must compute the initial energy $E_0$ and the final energy $E_G$.\n\n1.  **Calculate the initial energy, $E_0$**:\n    At $t=0$, $u=v=0$ and $\\eta = \\eta_0(x) = A\\exp(-x^2/(2\\sigma^2))$.\n    $$ E_0 = \\frac{1}{2}g\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\eta_0^2\\,dx = \\frac{1}{2}gA^2 \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{\\sigma^2}\\right)dx $$\n    Using the standard Gaussian integral $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-ax^2)dx = \\sqrt{\\pi/a}$, with $a=1/\\sigma^2$:\n    $$ E_0 = \\frac{1}{2}gA^2 \\sqrt{\\pi\\sigma^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2} g A^2 \\sigma $$\n\n2.  **Calculate the final geostrophic energy, $E_G$**:\n    The final energy is contained in the geostrophic height and velocity fields:\n    $$ E_G = \\frac{1}{2}g\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\eta_G^2\\,dx + \\frac{1}{2}H\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}(u_G^2+v_G^2)\\,dx $$\n    Since $u_G=0$ and $v_G = (g/f)d\\eta_G/dx$:\n    $$ E_G = \\frac{1}{2}g\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\eta_G^2\\,dx + \\frac{1}{2}H\\left(\\frac{g}{f}\\right)^2\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\left(\\frac{d\\eta_G}{dx}\\right)^2\\,dx = \\frac{g}{2}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\left[\\eta_G^2 + L_D^2\\left(\\frac{d\\eta_G}{dx}\\right)^2\\right]dx $$\n    Calculating this integral directly is cumbersome. It is more straightforward to use Parseval's theorem in Fourier space. Let $\\hat{f}(k) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(x) e^{-ikx} dx$.

            "problem": "Consider a straight coastline aligned with the $x$-axis at $y=0$, with the ocean occupying $y0$. The fluid is a homogeneous layer of constant mean depth $H$ and density $\\rho$, governed by the linearized rotating shallow-water equations on an $f$-plane with constant Coriolis parameter $f$ and gravitational acceleration $g$. Neglect friction and any planetary vorticity gradient. Let the free-surface displacement be $\\,\\eta(x,y,t)\\,$ and the horizontal velocities be $\\,u(x,y,t)\\,$ alongshore (parallel to the coast) and $\\,v(x,y,t)\\,$ cross-shore (normal to the coast).

Then, using the physically relevant solution branch that decays offshore, compute the time-mean mechanical energy flux density parallel to the boundary and integrate it over the cross-shore ($y$) from $0$ to $\\infty$ to obtain the total time-mean power transported along the boundary by the wave.

            "solution": "The analysis begins with the validation of the problem statement.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n-   **Geometry**: A straight coastline is aligned with the $x$-axis at $y=0$. The ocean occupies the region $y0$.\n-   **Fluid Properties**: The fluid is a homogeneous layer of constant mean depth $H$ and constant density $\\rho$.\n-   **Governing Dynamics**: The system is described by the linearized rotating shallow-water equations on an $f$-plane, with a constant Coriolis parameter $f$ and constant gravitational acceleration $g$.\n-   **Assumptions**: Friction and the planetary vorticity gradient ($\\beta$-effect) are neglected.\n-   **Variables**: Free-surface displacement is $\\eta(x,y,t)$, alongshore velocity is $u(x,y,t)$, and cross-shore velocity is $v(x,y,t)$.\n-   **Boundary Conditions**: An impermeable coast imposes the condition $v(x,0,t)=0$. The wave is \"coastally trapped,\" which implies its amplitude must decay to zero for $y \\to \\infty$.\n-   **Wave Amplitude**: The amplitude of the free surface at the coast is given as $A_0$, corresponding to the wave crest, i.e., $A_0 = \\eta(x,0,t)|_{\\text{crest}}$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n-   **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem describes a coastal Kelvin wave, a fundamental and well-established solution to the rotating shallow-water equations. The physical model and the specified conditions are standard in geophysical fluid dynamics. The problem is scientifically sound.\n-   **Well-Posed**: The system of partial differential equations, along with the boundary conditions of impermeability at the coast ($y=0$) and decay far from the coast ($y \\to \\infty$), constitutes a well-posed problem that admits a unique, stable solution corresponding to the Kelvin wave.\n-   **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, standard terminology from physics and mathematics, free of any subjective or ambiguous language.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a standard, self-contained, and well-posed problem in geophysical fluid dynamics. A complete solution will be derived from first principles.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe governing linearized rotating shallow-water equations on an $f$-plane are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} - fv = -g \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial x} \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} + fu = -g \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial y} \\quad (2)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial t} + H \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} \\right) = 0 \\quad (3)\n$$\nWe seek a coastally trapped wave solution that propagates along the $x$-axis. A Kelvin wave is characterized by an exact geostrophic balance in the cross-shore direction, which implies that the cross-shore velocity $v$ is identically zero everywhere. We test the ansatz $v(x,y,t) = 0$.\n\nWith $v=0$, the governing equations simplify to:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = -g \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial x} \\quad (1')\n$$\n$$\nfu = -g \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial y} \\quad (2')\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial t} + H \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} = 0 \\quad (3')\n$$\nThe boundary condition $v(x,0,t)=0$ is trivially satisfied by this ansatz. We search for solutions of the form $u = \\text{Re}[\\hat{u}(y)e^{i(kx-\\omega t)}]$ and $\\eta = \\text{Re}[\\hat{\\eta}(y)e^{i(kx-\\omega t)}]$. Substituting these into equations $(1')$ and $(3')$ yields:\n$$\n-i\\omega \\hat{u} = -ikg \\hat{\\eta} \\implies \\omega \\hat{u} = kg \\hat{\\eta} \\quad (4)\n$$\n$$\n-i\\omega \\hat{\\eta} + ikH \\hat{u} = 0 \\implies \\omega \\hat{\\eta} = kH \\hat{u} \\quad (5)\n$$\nSubstituting $\\hat{u}$ from $(4)$ into $(5)$:\n$$\n\\omega \\hat{\\eta} = kH \\left(\\frac{kg}{\\omega}\\hat{\\eta}\\right) \\implies \\omega^2 \\hat{\\eta} = gHk^2 \\hat{\\eta}\n$$\nFor a non-trivial solution ($\\hat{\\eta} \\neq 0$), we obtain the dispersion relation:\n$$\n\\omega^2 = gHk^2 \\implies \\frac{\\omega}{k} = \\pm\\sqrt{gH}\n$$\nThe phase speed is $c_p = \\omega/k = \\pm c$, where $c = \\sqrt{gH}$ is the phase speed of non-rotating shallow water waves.\n\nNext, we determine the cross-shore structure from equation $(2')$, $fu = -g \\frac{d\\eta}{dy}$. Using the wave solution form, this becomes $f\\hat{u} = -g \\frac{d\\hat{\\eta}}{dy}$. Substituting $\\hat{u}=(kg/\\omega)\\hat{\\eta}$ from $(4)$:\n$$\nf \\left(\\frac{kg}{\\omega}\\hat{\\eta}\\right) = -g \\frac{d\\hat{\\eta}}{dy} \\implies \\frac{d\\hat{\\eta}}{dy} = -\\frac{fk}{\\omega} \\hat{\\eta}\n$$\nThis is a first-order ordinary differential equation for $\\hat{\\eta}(y)$, with the solution:\n$$\n\\hat{\\eta}(y) = \\hat{\\eta}(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{fk}{\\omega} y\\right)\n$$\nFor the wave to be \"coastally trapped\", its amplitude must decay as $y \\to \\infty$. This requires the argument of the exponential to be real and negative:\n$$\n\\frac{fk}{\\omega}  0 \\implies \\frac{f}{c_p}  0\n$$\nThis condition dictates the direction of propagation. If $f  0$ (Northern Hemisphere), then $c_p  0$, and the wave propagates in the $+x$ direction (with the coast on its right). If $f  0$ (Southern Hemisphere), then $c_p  0$, and the wave propagates in the $-x$ direction (with the coast on its left). We can write the phase speed concisely as $c_p = \\omega/k = \\text{sgn}(f)c$.\nThe decay scale is the Rossby radius of deformation, $L_R = \\frac{\\omega}{fk} = \\frac{c_p}{f} = \\frac{\\text{sgn}(f)c}{f} = \\frac{c}{|f|}$.\nThe surface displacement is $\\eta(x,y,t) = A_0 \\exp(-y/L_R) \\cos(kx-\\omega t) = A_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|f|y}{c}\\right) \\cos(kx-\\omega t)$, where $A_0$ is the amplitude at the coast ($y=0$) at the wave crest.\n\nThe corresponding alongshore velocity $u$ is found from $fu = -g \\frac{\\partial\\eta}{\\partial y}$:\n$$\nu = -\\frac{g}{f} \\frac{\\partial\\eta}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{g}{f} \\left[ A_0 \\left(-\\frac{|f|}{c}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|f|y}{c}\\right) \\cos(kx-\\omega t) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nu = \\frac{g|f|}{fc} \\eta = \\frac{g}{c} \\text{sgn}(f) \\eta = \\text{sgn}(f) \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{H}} \\eta\n$$\nSo, $u(x,y,t) = A_0 \\text{sgn}(f) \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{H}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|f|y}{c}\\right) \\cos(kx-\\omega t)$.\n\nTo find the energy transport, we first establish the energy conservation law. The total energy density (per unit area) $E$ is the sum of kinetic and potential energy densities:\n$$\nE = E_k + E_p = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho H (u^2 + v^2) + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho g \\eta^2\n$$\nFor our Kelvin wave solution with $v=0$, this is $E = \\frac{1}{2}\\rho H u^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\rho g \\eta^2$. The energy conservation equation for the linearized system is $\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\vec{F} = 0$, where $\\vec{F}$ is the energy flux vector. We derive $\\vec{F}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial t} = \\rho H u \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} + \\rho g \\eta \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial t}\n$$\nUsing the governing equations $(1')$ and $(3')$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial t} = \\rho H u \\left(-g \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial x}\\right) + \\rho g \\eta \\left(-H \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\\right) = -g\\rho H \\left(u \\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial x} + \\eta \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x}\\right) = -g\\rho H \\frac{\\partial(u\\eta)}{\\partial x}\n$$\nSince $v=0$, the divergence of the flux is $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{F} = \\frac{\\partial F_x}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial F_y}{\\partial y}$. This implies that the alongshore energy flux is $F_x = g\\rho H u\\eta$ and the cross-shore flux $F_y=0$. The energy flux vector is thus $\\vec{F} = (g\\rho H u\\eta, 0)$.\n\nWe need the time-mean alongshore energy flux, denoted $\\langle F_x \\rangle$.\n$$\nF_x(x,y,t) = g\\rho H u \\eta = g\\rho H \\left(\\text{sgn}(f)\\sqrt{\\frac{g}{H}}\\eta\\right) \\eta = \\rho g\\sqrt{gH} \\text{sgn}(f) \\eta^2 = \\rho g c \\, \\text{sgn}(f) \\eta^2\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\eta$:\n$$\nF_x(x,y,t) = \\rho g c \\, \\text{sgn}(f) \\left[ A_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{|f|y}{c}\\right) \\cos(kx-\\omega t) \\right]^2\n$$\n$$\nF_x(x,y,t) = \\rho g c \\, \\text{sgn}(f) A_0^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2|f|y}{c}\\right) \\cos^2(kx-\\omega t)\n$$\nThe time average of $\\cos^2(kx-\\omega t)$ over one wave period is $\\frac{1}{2}$. The time-mean flux density is:\n$$\n\\langle F_x \\rangle(y) = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho g c \\, \\text{sgn}(f) A_0^2 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2|f|y}{c}\\right)\n$$\nThe total time-mean power transported along the boundary, $P_{total}$, is the integral of this flux density over the cross-shore direction from $y=0$ to $y=\\infty$:\n$$\nP_{total} = \\int_0^\\infty \\langle F_x \\rangle(y) dy = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho g c \\, \\text{sgn}(f) A_0^2 \\int_0^\\infty \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2|f|y}{c}\\right) dy\n$$\nThe integral evaluates to:\n$$\n\\int_0^\\infty \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2|f|y}{c}\\right) dy = \\left[ \\frac{c}{-2|f|} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{2|f|y}{c}\\right) \\right]_0^\\infty = 0 - \\frac{c}{-2|f|} = \\frac{c}{2|f|}\n$$\nSubstituting this result into the expression for $P_{total}$:\n$$\nP_{total} = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\rho g c \\, \\text{sgn}(f) A_0^2 \\right) \\left( \\frac{c}{2|f|} \\right) = \\frac{1}{4} \\rho g c^2 A_0^2 \\frac{\\text{sgn}(f)}{|f|}\n$$\nSince $\\frac{\\text{sgn}(f)}{|f|} = \\frac{f}{|f|^2} = \\frac{f}{f^2} = \\frac{1}{f}$, we have:\n$$\nP_{total} = \\frac{\\rho g c^2 A_0^2}{4f}\n$$\nFinally, expressing the answer in terms of the given parameters by substituting $c^2=gH$:\n$$\nP_{total} = \\frac{\\rho g (gH) A_0^2}{4f} = \\frac{\\rho g^2 H A_0^2}{4f}\n$$\nThis expression demonstrates that the alongshore energy transport is unidirectional. Since $\\rho, g, H,$ and $A_0^2$ are all positive, the sign of $P_{total}$ is determined solely by the sign of $f$. For $f0$, $P_{total}0$, indicating energy transport in the $+x$ direction. For $f0$, $P_{total}0$, indicating energy transport in the $-x$ direction. This direction is consistent with the direction of phase propagation derived earlier.",
