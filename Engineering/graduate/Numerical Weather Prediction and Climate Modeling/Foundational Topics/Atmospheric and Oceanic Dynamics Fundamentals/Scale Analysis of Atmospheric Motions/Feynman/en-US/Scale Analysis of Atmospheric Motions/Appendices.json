The Rossby number $Ro$ determines the leading-order balance in the momentum equation. The nondimensional equation is $Ro (\\frac{D\\boldsymbol{u}^{*}}{Dt^{*}}) + \\hat{\\boldsymbol{k}}\\times\\boldsymbol{u}^{*} \\approx -\\text{(const)}\\nabla^{*}p^{*}$.\n\n-   For the **mesoscale**, $Ro_{\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 3.88 \\gg 1$. The Rossby number is large, indicating that the inertial acceleration term ($Ro$ times the material derivative) is substantially larger than the Coriolis term. The dynamics are highly nonlinear and dominated by inertia. The Coriolis force acts as a smaller perturbation. A balance between inertial forces and the pressure gradient force is expected, and the system is far from geostrophic balance.\n\n-   For the **synoptic scale**, $Ro_{\\mathrm{s}} \\approx 0.0970 \\ll 1$. The Rossby number is small. This implies that the inertial acceleration term is an order of magnitude smaller than the Coriolis and pressure gradient terms. To the lowest order, the inertial term can be neglected, leading to a primary balance between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force: $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{k}}\\times\\boldsymbol{u}^{*} \\approx -\\text{(const)}\\nabla^{*}p^{*}$. This is the geostrophic balance. Large-scale weather systems (highs and lows) are well-approximated by this balance.\n\n-   For the **planetary scale**, $Ro_{\\mathrm{p}} \\approx 0.0291 \\ll 1$. The Rossby number is even smaller than for the synoptic scale. This indicates that the flow is very strongly constrained by Earth's rotation, and the geostrophic balance is an extremely accurate leading-order approximation. Inertial effects are minimal compared to the Coriolis and pressure gradient forces. It is critical to note that for such large scales, the f-plane approximation (constant $f$) breaks down, and the variation of $f$ with latitude (the $\\beta$-effect) becomes a dominant physical mechanism, which is essential for planetary Rossby waves. However, within the confines of the f-plane model presented, the conclusion is one of an exceptionally strong geostrophic constraint.\n\nThe transition from mesoscale to planetary scale is a transition from an inertia-dominated regime to a rotation-dominated (geostrophic) regime.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the steady, axisymmetric radial momentum balance for a vortex, an analysis of this balance, and a calculation of the relative importance of curvature effects in a specific case.\n\nThe starting point is Newton's second law for a fluid parcel in a frame of reference rotating with the Earth. For an inviscid, Boussinesq fluid, the horizontal momentum equation is:\n$$ \\frac{D\\vec{u}}{Dt} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\nabla_h p - f\\hat{k} \\times \\vec{u} $$\nwhere $\\vec{u}$ is the horizontal velocity vector, $\\frac{D}{Dt}$ is the material derivative, $\\rho_0$ is a constant reference density, $\\nabla_h p$ is the horizontal pressure gradient, $f$ is the Coriolis parameter, and $\\hat{k}$ is the local vertical unit vector.\n\nWe adopt cylindrical polar coordinates $(r, \\theta)$ appropriate for an axisymmetric vortex. The velocity vector is $\\vec{u} = u_r \\hat{r} + v_{\\theta} \\hat{\\theta}$, where $u_r$ is the radial velocity and $v_{\\theta}$ is the tangential (azimuthal) velocity.

The problem specifies a vortex in the Northern Hemisphere, so $f > 0$. For a cyclonic vortex (low pressure at the center), the tangential flow is counter-clockwise, so $v_{\\theta} > 0$. The Coriolis force per unit mass, $f v_{\\theta}$, is directed radially outward.\n\nThe pressure gradient term in the radial direction is $-\\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial r}$. For a low-pressure vortex, pressure increases with radius, so $\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial r} > 0$, and this force is directed radially inward.\n\nCombining these terms, the full radial momentum equation is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial t} + u_r \\frac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial r} + \\frac{v_{\\theta}}{r} \\frac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial \\theta} - \\frac{v_{\\theta}^2}{r} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial r} + f v_{\\theta} $$\nThe problem asks for the leading-order, steady, axisymmetric balance.

Therefore, the advective term $u_r \\frac{\\partial u_r}{\\partial r}$ is of second order in the small radial velocity and can be neglected compared to the other terms.\n\nApplying these simplifications, the equation reduces to:\n$$ -\\frac{v_{\\theta}^2}{r} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial r} + f v_{\\theta} $$\nThis is the desired leading-order steady, axisymmetric horizontal radial momentum balance, known as the **gradient wind balance**. Rearranging the terms to represent a balance of forces (per unit mass) makes the physical meaning clearer:\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial r} = f v_{\\theta} + \\frac{v_{\\theta}^2}{r} $$\nThis equation states that the inward-directed pressure gradient force (left side) is balanced by the sum of the outward-directed Coriolis force ($f v_{\\theta}$) and the outward-directed centrifugal force ($\\frac{v_{\\theta}^2}{r}$).\n\nThe geostrophic balance is a simpler balance where the pressure gradient force is balanced solely by the Coriolis force, neglecting all acceleration terms: $\\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial r} = f v_g$, where $v_g$ is the geostrophic wind. The gradient wind balance modifies the geostrophic balance by including the centrifugal acceleration, $\\frac{v_{\\theta}^2}{r}$, which arises from the curvature of the flow streamlines. This term is explicitly identified as the **curvature contribution**. For a cyclonic vortex ($v_{\\theta} > 0$) in the Northern Hemisphere ($f > 0$), this term adds to the Coriolis force, meaning the pressure gradient must be stronger to support the flow, or for a given pressure gradient, the gradient wind $v_{\\theta}$ is less than the geostrophic wind $v_g$.\n\nTo form a nondimensional measure of the curvature term's importance relative to the Coriolis term, we take the ratio of their magnitudes. The magnitude of the curvature acceleration is $\\frac{v_{\\theta}^2}{r}$. The magnitude of the Coriolis acceleration is $|f v_{\\theta}|$. The ratio is:\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{\\left| \\frac{v_{\\theta}^2}{r} \\right|}{|f v_{\\theta}|} = \\frac{|v_{\\theta}|}{|f|r} $$\nThis dimensionless quantity is known as the Rossby number, which generally measures the ratio of inertial to Coriolis forces.\n\nFinally, we estimate this ratio for the given tropical cyclone.

A value much greater than $1$ indicates that the curvature term is significantly larger than the Coriolis term, meaning that the geostrophic approximation is very poor for this system and the flow is highly ageostrophic. The primary balance is between the pressure gradient and the centrifugal force (a cyclostrophic balance).",

The system of equations is:\n$$ -i \\omega_{\\hat{}} \\hat{u} = -ik \\hat{\\phi} $$\n$$ -i \\omega_{\\hat{}} \\hat{w} = -im \\hat{\\phi} + \\hat{b} $$\n$$ ik \\hat{u} + im \\hat{w} = 0 $$\n$$ -i \\omega_{\\hat{}} \\hat{b} + \\hat{w} N^2 = 0 $$\n\nTo derive the dispersion relation, we systematically eliminate the amplitudes.\nFrom the third equation (continuity), we express $\\hat{u}$ in terms of $\\hat{w}$:\n$$ \\hat{u} = -\\frac{m}{k} \\hat{w} $$\nSubstitute this into the first equation ($x$-momentum) to find $\\hat{\\phi}$:\n$$ \\omega_{\\hat{}} \\left(-\\frac{m}{k} \\hat{w}\\right) = k \\hat{\\phi} \\implies \\hat{\\phi} = -\\frac{m \\omega_{\\hat{}}}{k^2} \\hat{w} $$\nFrom the fourth equation (buoyancy), we express $\\hat{b}$ in terms of $\\hat{w}$:\n$$ i \\omega_{\\hat{}} \\hat{b} = \\hat{w} N^2 \\implies \\hat{b} = \\frac{N^2}{i \\omega_{\\hat{}}} \\hat{w} = -i \\frac{N^2}{\\omega_{\\hat{}}} \\hat{w} $$\nNow, substitute the expressions for $\\hat{\\phi}$ and $\\hat{b}$ into the second equation ($z$-momentum):\n$$ -i \\omega_{\\hat{}} \\hat{w} = -im \\left(-\\frac{m \\omega_{\\hat{}}}{k^2} \\hat{w}\\right) + \\left(-i \\frac{N^2}{\\omega_{\\hat{}}} \\hat{w}\\right) $$\nAssuming a non-trivial wave solution ($\\hat{w} \\neq 0$), we can divide the entire equation by $-i\\hat{w}$:\n$$ \\omega_{\\hat{}} = - \\frac{m^2 \\omega_{\\hat{}}}{k^2} + \\frac{N^2}{\\omega_{\\hat{}}} $$\nTo eliminate the denominators, we multiply by $\\omega_{\\hat{}}k^2$:\n$$ \\omega_{\\hat{}}^2 k^2 = -m^2 \\omega_{\\hat{}}^2 + N^2 k^2 $$\nRearranging the terms gives the dispersion relation for internal gravity waves under the specified assumptions:\n$$ \\omega_{\\hat{}}^2 (k^2 + m^2) = N^2 k^2 $$\n$$ \\omega_{\\hat{}}^2 = \\frac{N^2 k^2}{k^2 + m^2} $$\n\nThe problem specifies stationary mountain waves, which means the wave pattern is fixed with respect to the ground. This corresponds to a ground-based frequency of $\\omega = 0$. The intrinsic frequency is therefore:\n$$ \\omega_{\\hat{}} = 0 - kU = -kU $$\nSubstituting this into the dispersion relation yields the constraint on the wavenumbers $(k,m)$ for stationary waves:\n$$ (-kU)^2 = \\frac{N^2 k^2}{k^2 + m^2} $$\n$$ k^2 U^2 = \\frac{N^2 k^2}{k^2 + m^2} $$\nFor a wave to exist, its wavenumber $k$ must be non-zero ($k \\neq 0$). We can divide by $k^2$:\n$$ U^2 = \\frac{N^2}{k^2 + m^2} $$\nThis can be rearranged to:\n$$ k^2 + m^2 = \\frac{N^2}{U^2} $$\nThis equation describes the locus of allowed wavenumber vectors for stationary waves, which is a circle in the $(k,m)$ plane with radius $N/U$.\n\nWe need to find the shortest possible horizontal wavelength, $\\lambda_x$. The horizontal wavelength is related to the horizontal wavenumber by $\\lambda_x = 2\\pi/|k|$. The shortest wavelength corresponds to the largest possible magnitude of the wavenumber, $k_{max}$. From the constraint equation, $k^2 = (N/U)^2 - m^2$. To maximize $k^2$, we must minimize $m^2$. For waves that can propagate vertically (i.e., not decay with height), the vertical wavenumber $m$ must be a real number, so $m^2 \\geq 0$. The minimum value of $m^2$ is therefore $0$. This case, $m=0$, corresponds to a hydrostatic wave with infinite vertical wavelength.\nSetting $m^2=0$, we find the maximum value for $k^2$:\n$$ k_{max}^2 = \\left(\\frac{N}{U}\\right)^2 \\implies k_{max} = \\frac{N}{U} $$\n(assuming $k>0$, $N>0$, $U>0$).\nThe shortest horizontal wavelength, $\\lambda_{x,min}$, is then:\n$$ \\lambda_{x,min} = \\frac{2\\pi}{k_{max}} = \\frac{2\\pi U}{N} $$\n\nFinally, we apply the Nyquist sampling criterion. To resolve a wave of a certain wavelength $\\lambda$, a numerical grid must have at least two grid points per wavelength. This means the grid spacing $\\Delta x$ must be no more than half the wavelength: $\\Delta x \\le \\lambda/2$. To resolve the shortest possible stationary wave, the grid spacing must satisfy:\n$$ \\Delta x \\le \\frac{\\lambda_{x,min}}{2} $$\nThe largest permissible horizontal grid spacing, $\\Delta x_{max}$, is therefore:\n$$ \\Delta x_{max} = \\frac{\\lambda_{x,min}}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi U}{N}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi U}{N} $$\n\nWe are given the parameters $U = 20\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s}^{-1}$ and $N = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Substituting these values:\n$$ \\Delta x_{max} = \\frac{\\pi (20\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s}^{-1})}{1.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 2000\\pi\\,\\mathrm{m} $$\nTo express this in kilometers, we divide by $1000$:\n$$ \\Delta x_{max} = 2\\pi\\,\\mathrm{km} \\approx 6.283185...\\,\\mathrm{km} $$\nRounding the answer to four significant figures, as requested:\n$$ \\Delta x_{max} \\approx 6.283\\,\\mathrm{km} $$\nThis is the largest horizontal grid spacing that a mesoscale model can have while still being able to resolve the shortest stationary, vertically propagating internal gravity waves in the given environment.",
