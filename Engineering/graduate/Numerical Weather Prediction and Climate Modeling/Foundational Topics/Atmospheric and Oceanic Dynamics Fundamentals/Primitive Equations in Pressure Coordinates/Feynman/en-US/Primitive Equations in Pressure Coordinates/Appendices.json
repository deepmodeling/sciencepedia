The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, with sufficient information to perform the requested derivation and calculation. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual unsoundness.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A full, reasoned solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nThe derivation begins with the first law of thermodynamics for a unit mass of an ideal gas, which can be written as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}q = c_p \\mathrm{d}T - \\alpha \\mathrm{d}p\n$$\nwhere $\\mathrm{d}q$ is the diabatic heat added per unit mass, $c_p$ is the specific heat at constant pressure, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $\\alpha$ is the specific volume, and $p$ is the pressure.\n\nFor a dry adiabatic process, there is no heat exchange with the surroundings, so $\\mathrm{d}q = 0$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\nc_p \\mathrm{d}T = \\alpha \\mathrm{d}p\n$$\nTo find the rate of temperature change for a moving air parcel (the Lagrangian or material derivative), we divide by the time differential $\\mathrm{d}t$:\n$$\nc_p \\frac{\\mathrm{D}T}{\\mathrm{D}t} = \\alpha \\frac{\\mathrm{D}p}{\\mathrm{D}t}\n$$\nIn pressure coordinates, the vertical motion, $\\omega$, is defined as the material derivative of pressure, $\\omega \\equiv \\mathrm{D}p/\\mathrm{D}t$. Substituting this definition yields:\n$$\nc_p \\frac{\\mathrm{D}T}{\\mathrm{D}t} = \\alpha \\omega\n$$\nRearranging for the parcel's temperature tendency gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{D}T}{\\mathrm{D}t} = \\frac{\\alpha}{c_p} \\omega\n$$\nThe material derivative $\\mathrm{D}/\\mathrm{D}t$ represents the total change following the motion and can be expanded into local and advective terms in the pressure coordinate system:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{D}}{\\mathrm{D}t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v}_h \\cdot \\nabla_p + \\omega \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial p}\n$$\nwhere $\\partial/\\partial t$ is the local (Eulerian) time derivative at a fixed point $(x, y, p)$, $\\mathbf{v}_h$ is the horizontal velocity vector, and $\\nabla_p$ is the horizontal gradient operator on a constant pressure surface.\n\nApplying this expansion to the temperature, $T$, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{D}T}{\\mathrm{D}t} = \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v}_h \\cdot \\nabla_p T + \\omega \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial p}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into our thermodynamic equation gives the full thermodynamic energy equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{v}_h \\cdot \\nabla_p T + \\omega \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial p} = \\frac{\\alpha}{c_p} \\omega\n$$\nThe local temperature tendency, $\\partial T/\\partial t$, is isolated by rearranging the terms:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} = -\\mathbf{v}_h \\cdot \\nabla_p T - \\omega \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial p} + \\frac{\\alpha}{c_p} \\omega\n$$\nThe terms on the right-hand side represent, respectively, horizontal temperature advection, vertical temperature advection, and the temperature change due to adiabatic compression/expansion. The problem asks for the \"dry adiabatic contribution of vertical motion,\" which is precisely this last term, representing the physical process of heating or cooling due to a parcel's vertical displacement.\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} \\right)_{\\text{adiabatic vert}} = \\frac{\\alpha}{c_p} \\omega\n$$\nNext, we use the ideal gas law for dry air, $pv = R_d T$, where $v$ is the specific volume (denoted here by $\\alpha$). Thus, $\\alpha = R_d T / p$. Substituting this into our expression gives:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} \\right)_{\\text{adiabatic vert}} = \\frac{1}{c_p} \\left( \\frac{R_d T}{p} \\right) \\omega = \\frac{R_d}{c_p} \\frac{T}{p} \\omega\n$$\nUsing the provided constant $\\kappa = R_d / c_p$, we arrive at the final expression for the tendency:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} \\right)_{\\text{adiabatic vert}} = \\frac{\\kappa T}{p} \\omega\n$$\n\n**Explanation of the Sign**\n\nThe sign convention for $\\omega$ is crucial. Since pressure decreases with increasing altitude in the atmosphere, a parcel moving upward (ascent) experiences a decrease in its pressure. Therefore, ascent corresponds to $\\omega = \\mathrm{D}p/\\mathrm{D}t  0$. Conversely, a parcel moving downward (descent) experiences an increase in its pressure, so descent corresponds to $\\omega  0$.\n\nIn the derived expression, the quantities $\\kappa$, absolute temperature $T$, and absolute pressure $p$ are all positive. Consequently, the sign of the temperature tendency is determined solely by the sign of $\\omega$.\n- For **ascent**, $\\omega  0$, which results in a negative tendency, $\\left( \\partial T / \\partial t \\right)_{\\text{adiabatic vert}}  0$. This represents **adiabatic cooling**, as the ascending air parcel expands against the lower ambient pressure, doing work on its environment and thus losing internal energy.\n- For **descent**, $\\omega  0$, which results in a positive tendency, $\\left( \\partial T / \\partial t \\right)_{\\text{adiabatic vert}}  0$. This represents **adiabatic warming**, as the descending air parcel is compressed by the higher ambient pressure, having work done on it by the environment and thus gaining internal energy.\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- $\\kappa = 0.286$\n- $T = 270\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- $p = 600\\,\\mathrm{hPa} = 600 \\times 100\\,\\mathrm{Pa} = 60000\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n- $\\omega = -0.1\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived equation:\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} \\right)_{\\text{adiabatic vert}} = \\frac{(0.286) (270\\,\\mathrm{K})}{60000\\,\\mathrm{Pa}} (-0.1\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})\n$$\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} \\right)_{\\text{adiabatic vert}} = \\frac{77.22\\,\\mathrm{K}}{60000\\,\\mathrm{Pa}} (-0.1\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})\n$$\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} \\right)_{\\text{adiabatic vert}} = (0.001287\\,\\mathrm{K}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}^{-1}) (-0.1\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})\n$$\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} \\right)_{\\text{adiabatic vert}} = -0.0001287\\,\\mathrm{K}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = -1.287 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{K}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem asks for the magnitude of this contribution.\n$$\n\\left| \\left( \\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial t} \\right)_{\\text{adiabatic vert}} \\right| = |-1.287 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{K}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}| = 1.287 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{K}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThis result is already expressed to four significant figures as required.",

It does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of Geostrophic Relations**\n\nThe primitive horizontal momentum equations in pressure coordinates, neglecting friction, are:\n$$\n\\frac{Du}{Dt} - fv = -\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial x}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{Dv}{Dt} + fu = -\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial y}\n$$\nwhere $u$ and $v$ are the zonal (eastward) and meridional (northward) wind components, respectively, $f$ is the Coriolis parameter, $\\Phi$ is the geopotential, and $\\frac{D}{Dt}$ is the material derivative.\n\nThe geostrophic approximation assumes that the flow is in a steady state and that the acceleration terms ($\\frac{Du}{Dt}$, $\\frac{Dv}{Dt}$) are negligible compared to the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force. This balance is characteristic of large-scale, slowly-evolving midlatitude atmospheric motions. Applying this approximation, the momentum equations reduce to the geostrophic balance equations:\n$$\n- fv_g = -\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial x} \\quad \\implies \\quad v_g = \\frac{1}{f} \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial x}\n$$\n$$\nfu_g = -\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial y} \\quad \\implies \\quad u_g = -\\frac{1}{f} \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial y}\n$$\nHere, $(u_g, v_g)$ denotes the geostrophic wind vector.\n\nA two-dimensional streamfunction $\\psi$ is defined such that the velocity components are given by $u = -\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial y}$ and $v = \\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial x}$. For the geostrophic wind, we define a geostrophic streamfunction $\\psi_g$.\nComparing the geostrophic wind relations with the definition of the streamfunction:\n$$\nu_g = -\\frac{\\partial \\psi_g}{\\partial y} = -\\frac{1}{f} \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial y} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{\\partial \\psi_g}{\\partial y} = \\frac{1}{f} \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial y}\n$$\n$$\nv_g = \\frac{\\partial \\psi_g}{\\partial x} = \\frac{1}{f} \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial x}\n$$\nUnder the assumption that $f$ is a constant, $f=f_0$, we can integrate these equations. From the first equation, integration with respect to $y$ gives $\\psi_g = \\frac{\\Phi}{f_0} + C_1(x)$. From the second, integration with respect to $x$ gives $\\psi_g = \\frac{\\Phi}{f_0} + C_2(y)$. For consistency, $C_1(x)$ and $C_2(y)$ must be equal to the same constant. Since the streamfunction is defined only up to an arbitrary additive constant (which does not affect the velocity field), we can set this constant to zero. Thus, for a constant Coriolis parameter $f_0$, the geostrophic streamfunction is directly proportional to the geopotential:\n$$\n\\psi_g = \\frac{\\Phi}{f_0}\n$$\nThe relative vorticity $\\zeta$ is the vertical component of the curl of the velocity field. In Cartesian coordinates, $\\zeta = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}$. The geostrophic relative vorticity $\\zeta_g$ is therefore:\n$$\n\\zeta_g = \\frac{\\partial v_g}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial u_g}{\\partial y}\n$$\nSubstituting the streamfunction definition:\n$$\n\\zeta_g = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\psi_g}{\\partial x}\\right) - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(-\\frac{\\partial \\psi_g}{\\partial y}\\right) = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi_g}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi_g}{\\partial y^2} = \\nabla_p^2 \\psi_g\n$$\nwhere $\\nabla_p^2 = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}$ is the horizontal Laplacian operator at a constant pressure surface.\nSubstituting the relationship $\\psi_g = \\Phi/f_0$:\n$$\n\\zeta_g = \\nabla_p^2 \\left(\\frac{\\Phi}{f_0}\\right) = \\frac{1}{f_0} \\nabla_p^2 \\Phi\n$$\nThis final expression relates the geostrophic relative vorticity directly to the Laplacian of the geopotential field, valid under the geostrophic and f-plane approximations.\n\n**Calculation of Geostrophic Relative Vorticity**\n\nWe are given the geopotential field:\n$$\n\\Phi(x,y,p) = \\Phi_b(p) + \\alpha \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{2}}{L_x^{2}} - \\frac{y^{2}}{L_y^{2}}\\right) + \\gamma x^{2} - \\delta y^{2}\n$$\nTo find $\\zeta_g$, we must compute $\\nabla_p^2 \\Phi = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\Phi}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\Phi}{\\partial y^2}$. The term $\\Phi_b(p)$ is horizontally uniform, so its partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$ are zero.\n\nFirst, we find the second partial derivative with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial x} = \\alpha \\left(-\\frac{2x}{L_x^2}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{2}}{L_x^{2}} - \\frac{y^{2}}{L_y^{2}}\\right) + 2\\gamma x\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\Phi}{\\partial x^2} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left[ \\alpha \\left(-\\frac{2x}{L_x^2}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{2}}{L_x^{2}} - \\frac{y^{2}}{L_y^{2}}\\right) + 2\\gamma x \\right]\n$$\nUsing the product rule on the first term:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\Phi}{\\partial x^2} = \\alpha \\left(-\\frac{2}{L_x^2}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{2}}{L_x^{2}} - \\frac{y^{2}}{L_y^{2}}\\right) + \\alpha \\left(-\\frac{2x}{L_x^2}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{2x}{L_x^2}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{2}}{L_x^{2}} - \\frac{y^{2}}{L_y^{2}}\\right) + 2\\gamma\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\Phi}{\\partial x^2} = \\alpha \\left(\\frac{4x^2}{L_x^4} - \\frac{2}{L_x^2}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{2}}{L_x^{2}} - \\frac{y^{2}}{L_y^{2}}\\right) + 2\\gamma\n$$\nBy symmetry, the second partial derivative with respect to $y$ is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial y} = \\alpha \\left(-\\frac{2y}{L_y^2}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{2}}{L_x^{2}} - \\frac{y^{2}}{L_y^{2}}\\right) - 2\\delta y\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 \\Phi}{\\partial y^2} = \\alpha \\left(\\frac{4y^2}{L_y^4} - \\frac{2}{L_y^2}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{2}}{L_x^{2}} - \\frac{y^{2}}{L_y^{2}}\\right) - 2\\delta\n$$\nThe Laplacian of the geopotential is the sum of these two derivatives:\n$$\n\\nabla_p^2 \\Phi = \\frac{\\partial^2 \\Phi}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 \\Phi}{\\partial y^2} = \\alpha \\left(\\frac{4x^2}{L_x^4} - \\frac{2}{L_x^2} + \\frac{4y^2}{L_y^4} - \\frac{2}{L_y^2}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{2}}{L_x^{2}} - \\frac{y^{2}}{L_y^{2}}\\right) + 2\\gamma - 2\\delta\n$$\nFinally, the geostrophic relative vorticity is $\\zeta_g = \\frac{1}{f_0} \\nabla_p^2 \\Phi$:\n$$\n\\zeta_g(x,y,p) = \\frac{1}{f_0} \\left[ \\alpha \\left( \\frac{4x^2}{L_x^4} - \\frac{2}{L_x^2} + \\frac{4y^2}{L_y^4} - \\frac{2}{L_y^2} \\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x^{2}}{L_x^{2}} - \\frac{y^{2}}{L_y^{2}}\\right) + 2(\\gamma - \\delta) \\right]\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression for $\\zeta_g$ in units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n\n**Discussion of Approximations**\n\nThe relations $\\psi_g = \\Phi/f_0$ and $\\zeta_g = \\nabla_p^2 \\psi_g$ are fundamental in quasi-geostrophic theory and rely on two key approximations:\n\n1.  **Geostrophic Approximation**: This balance requires the Rossby number, $Ro = U/(fL)$, to be small ($Ro \\ll 1$), where $U$ and $L$ are characteristic velocity and length scales of the motion. This implies that the fluid acceleration is negligible compared to the Coriolis and pressure gradient forces. It holds well for large-scale (synoptic scale, $L \\sim 1000 \\, \\mathrm{km}$), slowly evolving motions in the midlatitude free atmosphere.\n\n2.  **f-plane Approximation**: This involves treating the Coriolis parameter $f$ as a constant, $f=f_0$. In reality, $f = 2\\Omega\\sin\\phi$, where $\\Omega$ is Earth's angular rotation rate and $\\phi$ is the latitude. This parameter varies with the northward coordinate $y$. The f-plane approximation is valid only when the meridional extent of the motion, $L_y$, is small enough that the variation of $f$ across the domain is negligible compared to $f_0$. The next order of approximation is the $\\beta$-plane, where $f$ is linearized about a central latitude $\\phi_0$: $f(y) \\approx f_0 + \\beta y$, with $\\beta = (df/dy)_{\\phi_0}$. The f-plane approximation requires $\\beta L_y \\ll f_0$.\n\nIf the Coriolis parameter is allowed to vary with latitude, $f=f(y)$, the relationships derived above must be modified. The geostrophic wind components become $u_g = -\\frac{1}{f(y)}\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial y}$ and $v_g = \\frac{1}{f(y)}\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial x}$. An important consequence is that the geostrophic wind is no longer non-divergent:\n$$\n\\nabla_p \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_g = \\frac{\\partial u_g}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v_g}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y}\\left(\\frac{1}{f(y)}\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial x}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{f^2}\\frac{df}{dy}\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial x} = -\\frac{\\beta}{f}v_g \\neq 0\n$$\nSince the flow has non-zero divergence, a streamfunction $\\psi_g$ such that $(u_g, v_g) = (-\\frac{\\partial \\psi_g}{\\partial y}, \\frac{\\partial \\psi_g}{\\partial x})$ does not exist in the strict sense.

It is a standard problem in dynamic meteorology, involving the derivation and application of a fundamental quantity, Ertel Potential Vorticity. The problem provides all necessary data and definitions for a unique solution. The physical assumptions stipulated (hydrostatic balance, neglect of specific terms for synoptic-scale flow) are standard and appropriate for this context. The provided numerical values are physically realistic for the Earth's midlatitude atmosphere. The problem does not violate any of the invalidity criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of Ertel PV in Pressure Coordinates\n\nThe Ertel Potential Vorticity ($PV$) in height ($z$) coordinates is defined as:\n$$\nPV = \\frac{1}{\\rho} \\boldsymbol{\\omega}_a \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\nabla}\\theta\n$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the air density, $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_a$ is the three-dimensional absolute vorticity vector, and $\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}\\theta$ is the three-dimensional gradient of potential temperature $\\theta$.\n\nThe absolute vorticity vector $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_a$ is the sum of the relative vorticity vector ($\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_r = \\boldsymbol{\\nabla} \\times \\mathbf{v}$) and the planetary vorticity ($2\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}$):\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_a = \\boldsymbol{\\nabla} \\times \\mathbf{v} + 2\\boldsymbol{\\Omega}\n$$\nIn a local Cartesian coordinate system $(x, y, z)$ with unit vectors $(\\mathbf{i}, \\mathbf{j}, \\mathbf{k})$, and for synoptic-scale motions where the horizontal component of the Earth's rotation vector is neglected, we can write:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_a = \\left(\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial z}\\right)\\mathbf{i} + \\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} - \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x}\\right)\\mathbf{j} + \\left(f + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}\\right)\\mathbf{k}\n$$\nwhere $u, v, w$ are the wind components in the $x, y, z$ directions, respectively, and $f = 2\\Omega\\sin\\phi$ is the Coriolis parameter. Let $\\zeta = \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial x} - \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial y}$ be the vertical component of the relative vorticity.\n\nThe gradient of potential temperature is:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}\\theta = \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial x}\\mathbf{i} + \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial y}\\mathbf{j} + \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial z}\\mathbf{k}\n$$\n\nThe dot product $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_a \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\nabla}\\theta$ is then:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_a \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\nabla}\\theta = \\left(\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial z}\\right)\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial x} + \\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} - \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x}\\right)\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial y} + (f+\\zeta)\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial z}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that we should use assumptions appropriate for synoptic-scale flow.\n1.  **Scale Analysis**: For large-scale synoptic motions, horizontal variations of $\\theta$ are much smaller than its vertical variation ($|\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}_h \\theta| \\ll |\\partial\\theta/\\partial z|$). Also, terms involving vertical wind shear ($|\\partial u/\\partial z|, |\\partial v/\\partial z|$) are significant, but terms involving horizontal gradients of vertical velocity ($|\\partial w/\\partial x|, |\\partial w/\\partial y|$) are very small. Consequently, the first two terms in the expansion of the dot product, known as the tilting and baroclinic terms, are an order of magnitude smaller than the third term.\n    $$\n    \\left| \\left(\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial y} - \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial z}\\right)\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial x} + \\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z} - \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial x}\\right)\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial y} \\right| \\ll \\left| (f+\\zeta)\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial z} \\right|\n    $$\n    Neglecting these smaller terms, the expression for $PV$ simplifies to:\n    $$\n    PV \\approx \\frac{1}{\\rho}(f+\\zeta_z)\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial z}\n    $$\n    where $\\zeta_z$ denotes the vertical component of relative vorticity in z-coordinates.\n\n2.  **Hydrostatic Balance**: For synoptic-scale motions, the atmosphere is in approximate hydrostatic equilibrium. The hydrostatic relation from the primitive equations is:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} = -\\rho g\n    $$\nTo transform the expression from height coordinates to pressure coordinates, we use the chain rule for the vertical derivative of potential temperature:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial z} = \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial p} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z}\n$$\nSubstituting the hydrostatic relation into the chain rule expression gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial z} = \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial p} (-\\rho g)\n$$\nNow, we substitute this into the simplified expression for $PV$:\n$$\nPV \\approx \\frac{1}{\\rho}(f+\\zeta_z) \\left( -\\rho g \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial p} \\right)\n$$\nThe density $\\rho$ cancels out, yielding the expression for Ertel PV in pressure coordinates:\n$$\nPV \\approx -g (f+\\zeta_p) \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial p}\n$$\nHere, we have replaced $\\zeta_z$ with $\\zeta_p$, the vertical component of relative vorticity on an isobaric surface, as they are approximately equal for synoptic-scale motions. The provided value $\\zeta$ is on an isobaric surface, corresponding to $\\zeta_p$.\n\nThis is the desired expression, which depends only on the vertical component of absolute vorticity on an isobaric surface, $\\eta_p = f+\\zeta_p$, and the vertical gradient of potential temperature in pressure coordinates, $\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial p}$.\n\n### Part 2: Numerical Calculation of Ertel PV\n\nWe use the derived formula $PV = -g(f+\\zeta)\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial p}$ and the given values.\n\n1.  **Calculate the Coriolis parameter $f$**:\n    $$\n    f = 2 \\Omega \\sin \\phi = 2 \\times (7.292 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times \\sin(50^{\\circ})\n    $$\n    Using $\\sin(50^{\\circ}) \\approx 0.766044$:\n    $$\n    f \\approx 2 \\times (7.292 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times 0.766044 \\approx 1.11736 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Calculate the absolute vorticity $(f+\\zeta)$**:\n    $$\n    f + \\zeta \\approx (1.11736 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) + (3.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) = 1.41736 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n    $$\n\n3.  **Approximate the vertical potential temperature gradient $\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial p}$**:\n    We use a finite difference approximation based on the radiosonde data:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial p} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta \\theta}{\\Delta p} = \\frac{\\theta_2 - \\theta_1}{p_2 - p_1} = \\frac{336\\,\\mathrm{K} - 316\\,\\mathrm{K}}{500\\,\\mathrm{hPa} - 700\\,\\mathrm{hPa}} = \\frac{20\\,\\mathrm{K}}{-200\\,\\mathrm{hPa}}\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial p} = -0.1\\,\\mathrm{K}\\,\\mathrm{hPa}^{-1}\n    $$\n    To work in SI units, we convert hectopascals (hPa) to pascals (Pa), where $1\\,\\mathrm{hPa} = 100\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial p} = -0.1\\,\\mathrm{K}\\,(100\\,\\mathrm{Pa})^{-1} = -0.001\\,\\mathrm{K}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}^{-1} = -1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{K}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}^{-1}\n    $$\n\n4.  **Calculate the Potential Vorticity $PV$**:\n    Substitute the values into the formula:\n    $$\n    PV \\approx -g (f+\\zeta) \\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial p}\n    $$\n    $$\n    PV \\approx -(9.81\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}) \\times (1.41736 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (-1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{K}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}^{-1})\n    $$\n    The units are $(\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-2}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{K}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}^{-1}) = \\mathrm{K}\\,\\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}^{-1}$.
