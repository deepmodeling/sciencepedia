It is a well-posed, scientifically sound problem from classical wave mechanics. I will proceed to derive the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Analytic Solution\n\nThe problem is to solve the system of PDEs:\n1.  $\\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial t} + \\frac{1}{\\rho_0}\\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial x} = 0$\n2.  $\\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial t} + \\rho_0 c^2 \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial x} = 0$\n\nwith initial conditions:\n$p'(x,0) = p_a \\exp(-x^2 / (2\\sigma^2))$\n$u'(x,0) = 0$\n\nThis system can be decoupled into two standard 1D wave equations. To derive the wave equation for $p'$, we differentiate equation (1) with respect to $x$ and equation (2) with respect to $t$:\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 u'}{\\partial t \\partial x} + \\frac{1}{\\rho_0}\\frac{\\partial^2 p'}{\\partial x^2} = 0$\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 p'}{\\partial t^2} + \\rho_0 c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u'}{\\partial t \\partial x} = 0$\n\nFrom the first differentiated equation, we find $\\frac{\\partial^2 u'}{\\partial t \\partial x} = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_0}\\frac{\\partial^2 p'}{\\partial x^2}$. Substituting this into the second yields:\n$\\frac{\\partial^2 p'}{\\partial t^2} + \\rho_0 c^2 \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\rho_0}\\frac{\\partial^2 p'}{\\partial x^2}\\right) = 0 \\implies \\frac{\\partial^2 p'}{\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 p'}{\\partial x^2}$\n\nSimilarly, one can show that $u'$ also satisfies the wave equation: $\\frac{\\partial^2 u'}{\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u'}{\\partial x^2}$.\n\nThe general solution of the 1D wave equation $\\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 \\psi}{\\partial x^2}$ with initial conditions $\\psi(x,0) = f(x)$ and $\\frac{\\partial \\psi}{\\partial t}(x,0) = g(x)$ is given by d'Alembert's formula:\n$$\n\\psi(x,t) = \\frac{1}{2} [f(x-ct) + f(x+ct)] + \\frac{1}{2c} \\int_{x-ct}^{x+ct} g(\\xi) d\\xi\n$$\n\n**1. Solution for Pressure Perturbation $p'(x,t)$**\n\nThe initial condition for pressure is $p'(x,0) = p_a \\exp(-x^2 / (2\\sigma^2))$.\nWe need the initial time derivative, $\\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial t}(x,0)$. From the governing equation (2):\n$\\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial t}(x,0) = -\\rho_0 c^2 \\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial x}(x,0)$.\nSince $u'(x,0) = 0$ for all $x$, its spatial derivative is also zero: $\\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial x}(x,0) = 0$.\nThus, $\\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial t}(x,0) = 0$.\n\nApplying d'Alembert's formula for $p'(x,t)$ with $f(x) = p_a \\exp(-x^2 / (2\\sigma^2))$ and $g(x) = 0$:\n$$\np'(x,t) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ p_a \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x-ct)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) + p_a \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x+ct)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\right] + \\frac{1}{2c} \\int_{x-ct}^{x+ct} 0 \\, d\\xi\n$$\n$$\np'(x,t) = \\frac{p_a}{2} \\left[ \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x-ct)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) + \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x+ct)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nThis solution describes the initial Gaussian pulse splitting into two identical pulses of half the amplitude, one traveling to the right at speed $c$ and the other to the left at speed $c$.\n\n**2. Solution for Velocity Perturbation $u'(x,t)$**\n\nThe initial condition for velocity is $u'(x,0) = 0$.\nWe need the initial time derivative, $\\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial t}(x,0)$. From the governing equation (1):\n$\\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial t}(x,0) = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial x}(x,0)$.\nFirst, we compute the derivative of the initial pressure:\n$\\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial x}(x,0) = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} \\left[ p_a \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\right] = p_a \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\left(-\\frac{2x}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) = -\\frac{p_a x}{\\sigma^2} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)$.\nSo, the initial time derivative of velocity is:\n$\\frac{\\partial u'}{\\partial t}(x,0) = -\\frac{1}{\\rho_0} \\left( -\\frac{p_a x}{\\sigma^2} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{p_a x}{\\rho_0 \\sigma^2} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{x^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)$.\n\nApplying d'Alembert's formula for $u'(x,t)$ with $f(x) = 0$ and $g(x) = \\frac{p_a x}{\\rho_0 \\sigma^2} \\exp(-x^2 / (2\\sigma^2))$:\n$$\nu'(x,t) = \\frac{1}{2} [0 + 0] + \\frac{1}{2c} \\int_{x-ct}^{x+ct} \\frac{p_a \\xi}{\\rho_0 \\sigma^2} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\xi^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) d\\xi\n$$\nThe integral can be evaluated by recognizing that the integrand is the derivative of a Gaussian function. Let $H(\\xi) = -\\frac{p_a}{\\rho_0} \\exp(-\\xi^2/(2\\sigma^2))$. Then $\\frac{dH}{d\\xi} = -\\frac{p_a}{\\rho_0} \\exp(-\\xi^2/(2\\sigma^2)) \\cdot (-\\frac{2\\xi}{2\\sigma^2}) = \\frac{p_a \\xi}{\\rho_0 \\sigma^2} \\exp(-\\xi^2/(2\\sigma^2))$.\nSo, the integral is:\n$$\n\\int_{x-ct}^{x+ct} g(\\xi) d\\xi = \\left[ -\\frac{p_a}{\\rho_0} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\xi^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\right]_{x-ct}^{x+ct} = -\\frac{p_a}{\\rho_0} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x+ct)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) - \\left( -\\frac{p_a}{\\rho_0} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x-ct)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\right)\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{p_a}{\\rho_0} \\left[ \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x-ct)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x+ct)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the solution for $u'(x,t)$:\n$$\nu'(x,t) = \\frac{1}{2c} \\cdot \\frac{p_a}{\\rho_0} \\left[ \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x-ct)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x+ct)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nu'(x,t) = \\frac{p_a}{2\\rho_0 c} \\left[ \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x-ct)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x+ct)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) \\right]\n$$\nThis solution shows that the initially stationary medium is set in motion by the pressure gradients, resulting in two opposing velocity fields associated with the two separating pressure pulses.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\nNow I will evaluate each of the given options against the derived solution.\n\n**A.**\n$$\np'(x,t) = \\frac{p_a}{2}\\left[\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x-ct)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) + \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x+ct)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\\right],\n$$\n$$\nu'(x,t) = \\frac{p_a}{2\\rho_0 c}\\left[\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x-ct)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right) - \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x+ct)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right)\\right].\n$$\nThis option perfectly matches both the pressure solution and the velocity solution derived from first principles.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B.**\n$$\np'(x,t) = p_a \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{(x-ct)^2}{2\\sigma^2}\\right), \\qquad u'(x,t) = 0.\n$$\nThis option represents a single rightward-traveling pressure wave with no associated velocity field.\nLet's check the initial conditions.

With $u'(x,t)=0$, the first equation becomes $\\frac{1}{\\rho_0}\\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial x} = 0$, implying $p'$ cannot depend on $x$. However, the proposed solution for $p'$ clearly depends on $x$. Thus, the first PDE is violated. The second PDE becomes $\\frac{\\partial p'}{\\partial t}=0$, implying $p'$ cannot depend on $t$.

All data and definitions required for a unique and meaningful solution are provided. The context is a standard, albeit simplified, scenario in numerical atmospheric modeling, based on fundamental principles of wave mechanics and numerical analysis. The problem is therefore valid.\n\n**1) Continuum Dispersion Relation and Shortest Resolvable Wavelength ($\\lambda_{\\min}$)**\n\nThe governing equation for linear acoustic waves is given as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\nabla^2 p\n$$\nIn a two-dimensional Cartesian grid $(x, z)$, the Laplacian operator is $\\nabla^2 = \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial z^2}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\left( \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial z^2} \\right)\n$$\nWe assume a plane-wave ansatz for the solution of the form $p(x, z, t) = p_0 \\exp(i(k_x x + k_z z - \\omega t))$, where $k_x$ and $k_z$ are the wavenumbers in the $x$ and $z$ directions, respectively, and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency.\n\nTo find the continuum dispersion relation, we substitute the ansatz into the wave equation. First, we compute the necessary partial derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial t^2} = (-i\\omega)^2 p = -\\omega^2 p\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial x^2} = (ik_x)^2 p = -k_x^2 p\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial z^2} = (ik_z)^2 p = -k_z^2 p\n$$\nSubstituting these into the wave equation yields:\n$$\n-\\omega^2 p = c^2 (-k_x^2 p - k_z^2 p) = -c^2 (k_x^2 + k_z^2) p\n$$\nDividing by $-p$ (since $p$ is not identically zero), we obtain the continuum dispersion relation:\n$$\n\\omega^2 = c^2 (k_x^2 + k_z^2)\n$$\nAssuming non-negative frequency, $\\omega = c \\sqrt{k_x^2 + k_z^2}$. The magnitude of the total wavevector is $k = \\sqrt{k_x^2 + k_z^2}$, so the relation can be written as $\\omega = c k$.\n\nNext, we determine the shortest resolvable acoustic wavelength, $\\lambda_{\\min}$.
