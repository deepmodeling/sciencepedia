The atmosphere is assumed to be in hydrostatic balance:\n$$\\frac{dp}{dz} = -\\rho g$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the density. The atmosphere is also modeled as an ideal gas:\n$$p = \\rho R_d T$$\nSolving the ideal gas law for density gives $\\rho = \\frac{p}{R_d T}$.

The pressure scale height $H(z)$ is generally a function of altitude because temperature $T$ is.\n\nThe problem asks to make explicit where the assumption of a locally constant scale height enters. This assumption allows us to treat the relationship $\\frac{1}{p}\\frac{dp}{dz} = -\\frac{1}{H}$ as being evaluated with a constant $H$ value, that of the specific altitude of interest ($z = 5\\,\\mathrm{km}$).

The Brunt–Väisälä frequency $N$ represents the high-frequency limit for vertically propagating internal gravity waves. For a wave with intrinsic frequency $\\omega$, the condition for vertical propagation is $f  \\omega  N$, where $f$ is the Coriolis frequency (for inertia-gravity waves) or $0  \\omega  N$ if rotation is neglected. Therefore, the calculated value $N \\approx 0.01116\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ implies that only internal gravity waves with an intrinsic frequency lower than this value can propagate vertically. Waves with frequencies $\\omega  N$ are evanescent; they cannot propagate vertically and their energy is confined to a layer near their source. This frequency corresponds to a minimum buoyancy period of $T_{min} = 2\\pi/N \\approx 563\\,\\mathrm{s}$ (about $9.4$ minutes), meaning waves with shorter periods cannot propagate vertically.",
