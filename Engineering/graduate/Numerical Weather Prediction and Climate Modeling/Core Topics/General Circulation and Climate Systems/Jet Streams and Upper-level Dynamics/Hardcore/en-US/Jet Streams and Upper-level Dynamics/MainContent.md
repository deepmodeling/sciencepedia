## Introduction
Jet streams are powerful, fast-flowing rivers of air in the upper atmosphere that serve as the primary organizing features of mid-latitude weather and climate. Far from being static entities, their existence, structure, and variability are governed by a rich set of physical principles that connect the Earth's thermal structure to its large-scale circulation. Understanding these dynamics is essential for anyone seeking to master numerical weather prediction, climate modeling, or atmospheric science. This article addresses the fundamental question of what creates and maintains these jet streams and how their behavior influences a vast range of atmospheric phenomena. It bridges the gap between basic concepts and advanced diagnostic techniques used in modern research and forecasting.

Over the course of three chapters, you will build a comprehensive understanding of [upper-level dynamics](@entry_id:1133627). The first chapter, **Principles and Mechanisms**, lays the theoretical foundation, deriving the [thermal wind relation](@entry_id:192206), introducing the concepts of instability and potential vorticity, and exploring the crucial two-way street of wave-mean flow interaction. The second chapter, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, demonstrates how these principles are applied to real-world problems, from daily weather forecasting and climate change analysis to paleoclimatology and geoengineering. Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** chapter provides an opportunity to engage directly with these concepts through targeted problems, allowing you to calculate jet stream strength, diagnose instability, and quantify wave driving. We begin by dissecting the fundamental balances and relationships that give birth to the jet stream itself.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The existence and behavior of jet streams are governed by a set of fundamental principles that link the thermal structure of the atmosphere to its motion. In this chapter, we will dissect these principles, starting from the basic force balances that establish the jets and progressing to the complex wave-mean flow interactions that dictate their variability and long-term maintenance.

### The Thermal Wind Relation and Jet Structure

The primary reason for the existence of strong, upper-level westerly jets in the midlatitudes is the large-scale meridional temperature gradient between the warm equator and the cold poles. For large-scale atmospheric motions, the [dominant balance](@entry_id:174783) of forces in the horizontal is the **geostrophic balance**, where the pressure gradient force is offset by the Coriolis force. In the vertical, the balance is **hydrostatic**, with the [vertical pressure gradient](@entry_id:1133794) force balancing gravity. The combination of these two balances yields a powerful diagnostic relationship known as the **[thermal wind relation](@entry_id:192206)**.

In [pressure coordinates](@entry_id:1130145), the thermal wind relation connects the vertical shear of the [geostrophic wind](@entry_id:271692) to the horizontal temperature gradient. A more intuitive form in height coordinates ($z$) relates the [vertical shear](@entry_id:1133795) of the zonal wind ($u$) to the meridional [gradient of potential](@entry_id:268447) temperature ($\theta$). For a zonal wind $u_g$ in geostrophic balance, the relation is:

$$ \frac{\partial u_g}{\partial z} \approx -\frac{g}{f \theta} \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial y} $$

Here, $g$ is the [acceleration due to gravity](@entry_id:173411), $f$ is the Coriolis parameter, and $y$ is the meridional coordinate (positive northward). Since potential temperature $\theta$ generally decreases towards the pole in the troposphere ($\partial \theta / \partial y  0$) and $f$ is positive in the Northern Hemisphere, the [thermal wind equation](@entry_id:191267) dictates that the westerly winds must increase with height ($\partial u_g / \partial z > 0$). This [vertical shear](@entry_id:1133795) culminates in a wind maximum near the tropopause, where the meridional temperature gradient reverses or weakens significantly. This wind maximum is the jet stream.

This fundamental relationship allows us to distinguish between the two primary types of midlatitude jets: the subtropical jet and the eddy-driven jet .

The **subtropical jet** is located around $30^{\circ}$ latitude and is a direct thermal-wind response to the upper-tropospheric temperature gradient created by the poleward branch of the Hadley Cell. It is characterized by strong vertical shear concentrated in the upper troposphere, just below the high and stable tropopause, which is marked by a sharp increase in the **Brunt–Väisälä frequency** ($N^2$), a measure of [static stability](@entry_id:1132318).

The **eddy-driven jet**, typically found at higher latitudes (around $45^{\circ}$–$60^{\circ}$), owes its existence primarily to the momentum fluxes of transient weather systems (baroclinic eddies). While it also exists in thermal wind balance with the underlying temperature field, this temperature field is itself strongly shaped by the eddies. Consequently, the eddy-driven jet tends to have a more barotropic structure (weaker [vertical shear](@entry_id:1133795)) in the mid-to-upper troposphere, with its strongest shear concentrated in the lower troposphere where baroclinic eddy activity is most intense .

### Accelerations and Ageostrophic Flow: The Dynamics of Jet Streaks

While geostrophic balance provides an excellent first approximation for the large-scale flow, it is a state of exact balance and therefore permits no acceleration. Accelerations, which are essential for the development and evolution of weather systems, arise from departures from geostrophic balance. This deviation is known as the **ageostrophic wind**, $\mathbf{V}_a = \mathbf{V} - \mathbf{V}_g$, where $\mathbf{V}$ is the total wind and $\mathbf{V}_g$ is the [geostrophic wind](@entry_id:271692).

The importance of [ageostrophic flow](@entry_id:1120886) is vividly illustrated in the dynamics of a **[jet streak](@entry_id:1126824)**, which is a localized region of maximum wind speed embedded within the broader jet stream . As a parcel of air enters a [jet streak](@entry_id:1126824) (the **[entrance region](@entry_id:269854)**), it accelerates. As it leaves (the **exit region**), it decelerates. The horizontal momentum equation reveals the direct consequence of this acceleration. For a primarily zonal flow ($u$), the zonal momentum equation can be approximated as:

$$ \frac{Du}{Dt} \approx f v_a $$

where $\frac{Du}{Dt}$ is the Lagrangian acceleration of the zonal wind experienced by the air parcel and $v_a$ is the meridional (cross-stream) component of the [ageostrophic wind](@entry_id:1120887). In the Northern Hemisphere ($f>0$), this equation shows that acceleration ($Du/Dt > 0$) requires a poleward [ageostrophic flow](@entry_id:1120886) ($v_a > 0$), while deceleration ($Du/Dt  0$) requires an equatorward [ageostrophic flow](@entry_id:1120886) ($v_a  0$).

This leads to a characteristic secondary circulation around a straight [jet streak](@entry_id:1126824). In the [entrance region](@entry_id:269854), parcels accelerate, inducing an [ageostrophic flow](@entry_id:1120886) across the jet from the right (south) to the left (north). This cross-stream flow, being strongest at the jet core and weaker on the flanks, creates divergence in the right-entrance quadrant and convergence in the left-entrance quadrant. Conversely, in the exit region, parcels decelerate, inducing a cross-stream [ageostrophic flow](@entry_id:1120886) from left to right. This results in divergence in the left-exit quadrant and convergence in the right-exit quadrant. This four-quadrant pattern of upper-level divergence and convergence is of paramount importance for synoptic [meteorology](@entry_id:264031), as upper-level divergence provides the necessary "lift" to induce low-level convergence and ascent, fostering the development of surface cyclones and precipitation .

### The Genesis of Eddies: Baroclinic and Barotropic Instability

The midlatitudes are characterized by transient weather systems—cyclones and anticyclones—collectively referred to as **eddies**. These eddies are not random fluctuations; they are born from instabilities of the jet stream itself. There are two fundamental types of fluid [dynamic instability](@entry_id:137408) relevant to jet streams: baroclinic and [barotropic instability](@entry_id:264411) .

**Baroclinic instability** is the primary mechanism for the growth of midlatitude cyclones. Its energy source is the **Mean Available Potential Energy (APE)** stored in the large-scale meridional temperature gradient. The thermal wind relation implies that this temperature gradient is associated with vertical wind shear. Growing baroclinic eddies tap into this APE by transporting heat meridionally: warm air moves poleward and cold air moves equatorward (a positive eddy heat flux, $\overline{v'\theta'} > 0$). This process converts Mean APE into Eddy APE. Subsequently, the phase relationship of rising warm air and sinking cold air within the developing eddy converts Eddy APE into **Eddy Kinetic Energy (EKE)**, causing the storm to intensify. Thus, baroclinic instability is fundamentally tied to vertical wind shear and the release of potential energy.

**Barotropic instability**, by contrast, draws its energy directly from the **Mean Kinetic Energy (MKE)** of the background flow. This mechanism requires the existence of lateral (horizontal) shear in the jet. Growing barotropic eddies are structured in the horizontal plane such that their [eddy momentum flux](@entry_id:1124142) (or Reynolds stress), $\overline{u'v'}$, acts against the mean flow's lateral shear, $\partial \overline{u} / \partial y$. This process directly converts MKE to EKE, causing the mean jet to weaken and the eddies to grow. This instability can occur even in a fluid of uniform density (a barotropic fluid) and does not require a temperature gradient or vertical shear.

In the real atmosphere, both mechanisms can be active, often in a mixed barotropic-baroclinic form. However, the genesis of most midlatitude weather systems is dominated by baroclinic instability, which converts the potential energy associated with the pole-to-equator temperature contrast into the kinetic energy of storms.

### Potential Vorticity: A Unifying Dynamical Framework

A powerful and elegant framework for understanding [upper-level dynamics](@entry_id:1133627) is provided by the concept of **potential vorticity (PV)**. For adiabatic, [frictionless flow](@entry_id:195983), **Ertel's potential vorticity**, defined as

$$ q = \frac{\boldsymbol{\zeta}_a \cdot \nabla \theta}{\rho} $$

is a materially conserved quantity, meaning it is conserved following an air parcel ($Dq/Dt = 0$) . Here, $\boldsymbol{\zeta}_a$ is the [absolute vorticity](@entry_id:262794) vector (the sum of planetary and relative vorticity), $\nabla \theta$ is the gradient of potential temperature, and $\rho$ is the density.

PV combines the dynamics of the flow (vorticity) with its thermodynamics (stratification) into a single scalar tracer. The stratosphere is characterized by high static stability ($\theta$ increases rapidly with height), giving it high PV values. The troposphere has lower [static stability](@entry_id:1132318) and thus much lower PV values. This sharp contrast allows for the definition of a **dynamical tropopause** as a surface of constant PV, typically taken to be the $q=2$ PVU surface (where $1 \text{ PVU} = 10^{-6} \text{ K m}^2 \text{ kg}^{-1} \text{ s}^{-1}$) .

The power of PV thinking stems from the **invertibility principle**. This principle states that if the three-dimensional distribution of PV is known everywhere in a domain, along with appropriate boundary conditions (e.g., the potential temperature at the ground), the entire balanced wind and temperature fields can be uniquely determined. This means that the PV field contains all the essential information about the balanced state of the atmosphere. A localized region of high PV anomaly in the upper troposphere, for instance, corresponds to a cyclonic circulation and a cold-core low, while a low PV anomaly corresponds to an anticyclonic circulation and a warm-core high.

This principle explains the intimate relationship between jet streams and the PV structure of the tropopause. The dynamical tropopause slopes downward from the tropics to the poles. On an upper-tropospheric surface, this creates a strong meridional gradient of PV, separating the low-PV tropospheric air to the south from the high-PV stratospheric air to the north. Through the invertibility principle, this sharp "PV front" induces a strong, concentrated zonal wind maximum that is collocated with the PV gradient. The jet stream, therefore, "sits on the edge" of the stratospheric PV reservoir .

### Wave-Mean Flow Interaction: The Maintenance and Variability of Jets

The picture of the jet stream is incomplete without considering the continuous, two-way interaction between the mean flow (the jet) and the eddies (the waves). This field of study is known as **wave-mean flow interaction**.

A theoretical framework often used to simplify the governing [primitive equations](@entry_id:1130162) for large-scale dynamics is the **Quasi-Geostrophic (QG) approximation** . This approximation is an [asymptotic expansion](@entry_id:149302) valid for flows with a small **Rossby number** ($Ro = U/(fL) \ll 1$), indicating that the Coriolis force is dominant over inertial forces. For synoptic-scale motions, the **Burger number** ($Bu = (NH/(fL))^2$) is of order unity, signifying a balance between the effects of stratification and rotation.

Within this framework, the strong PV gradients associated with the jet stream create a kind of duct or **Rossby [waveguide](@entry_id:266568)** . The meridional gradient of the mean-state QG potential vorticity, $\bar{q}_y$, acts as a refractive index for Rossby waves. Regions of large, positive $\bar{q}_y$ (as found in the jet) can trap wave activity, preventing it from propagating away and instead ducting its energy zonally along the jet axis.

While waves are guided by the jet, they also exert a powerful influence back on it. To understand this, we examine the **zonal-mean angular momentum budget** . In the absence of eddies, solar heating would drive a simple meridional circulation that would attempt to spin up the entire atmosphere into [solid-body rotation](@entry_id:191086). Frictional drag at the surface would prevent this, but the resulting state would bear little resemblance to our atmosphere with its concentrated jets. The observed jet structure is maintained by the systematic transport of momentum by eddies. The eddy-induced acceleration of the zonal-mean wind, $\overline{u}$, is driven by the convergence of eddy momentum fluxes:

$$ \left(\frac{\partial \overline{u}}{\partial t}\right)_{\text{eddy}} = -\frac{1}{a\cos^2\phi}\frac{\partial}{\partial \phi}\left(\cos^2\phi\,\overline{u'v'}\right) - \frac{\partial}{\partial p}\left(\overline{u'\omega'}\right) $$

where the term involving $\overline{u'v'}$ represents the convergence of horizontal [momentum flux](@entry_id:199796). In the midlatitudes, baroclinic eddies systematically transport westerly momentum poleward away from their source regions and converge it into the jet core, maintaining the jet's strength against friction.

A more comprehensive diagnostic tool for wave-mean flow interaction is the **Eliassen-Palm (EP) flux**, $\mathbf{F}$ . In the QG framework, its components are given by:

$$ \mathbf{F} = (F_y, F_p) = \left( - \overline{u'v'}, \quad f_0 \frac{\overline{v'\theta'}}{\overline{\theta}_p} \right) $$

The EP flux vector points in the direction of Rossby wave group propagation. Its divergence, $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}$, represents the total forcing of the mean zonal flow by the eddies. A region of EP flux convergence ($\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}  0$) corresponds to wave deposition and a westerly (eastward) acceleration of the mean flow, while divergence ($\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F} > 0$) corresponds to an easterly (westward) acceleration. For typical developing baroclinic waves, which transport heat poleward ($\overline{v'\theta'} > 0$) and momentum equatorward ($\overline{u'v'}  0$), the EP flux vector points upward and poleward, illustrating the propagation of wave activity away from the lower-tropospheric storm tracks .

### Large-Scale Phenomena: Annular Modes and Stratospheric Coupling

The principles of wave-mean flow interaction are crucial for explaining dominant patterns of [climate variability](@entry_id:1122483) and the coupling between different layers of the atmosphere.

**Annular modes**, such as the Northern Annular Mode (NAM) and Southern Annular Mode (SAM), are the leading patterns of extratropical atmospheric variability . They manifest as a zonally symmetric seesaw of atmospheric mass between the polar cap and the midlatitudes, resulting in fluctuations in the latitude and strength of the eddy-driven jet. The persistence of these modes for weeks to months is explained by a positive **eddy-mean flow feedback**. For example, an initial poleward shift of the jet alters the "waveguide," causing the region of [eddy momentum flux](@entry_id:1124142) convergence (EP flux convergence) to also shift poleward. This anomalous eddy forcing then acts to reinforce the poleward jet shift, creating a self-sustaining anomaly. This feedback is most effective for latitudinal shifts, making the oscillation of the jet's position the most prominent feature of annular modes.

The vertical propagation of atmospheric waves also provides a powerful pathway for **[stratosphere-troposphere coupling](@entry_id:1132494)**, exemplified by **Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs)** . During a major SSW in the winter hemisphere, a surge of large-scale [planetary waves](@entry_id:195650) propagates from the troposphere into the stratosphere. There, the waves break and deposit strong easterly (westward) momentum, corresponding to a large region of EP flux divergence. This rapidly decelerates and can even reverse the strong westerly Polar Night Jet. The wave forcing also drives an anomalous meridional circulation with strong downwelling over the pole, which adiabatically compresses and dramatically warms the polar stratosphere—the "warming" of the event's name.

This stratospheric disruption does not remain isolated. The **[downward control](@entry_id:1123957) principle** states that the wave-driven circulation anomaly in the stratosphere extends its influence downward, inducing a response in the troposphere. This coupling is not instantaneous but occurs over a timescale of weeks. The typical tropospheric response to a major SSW is a shift toward the negative phase of the annular mode, characterized by a weaker, wavier, and more equatorward-located tropospheric jet, which can lead to significant surface weather and temperature anomalies, such as cold air outbreaks over North America and Eurasia .
