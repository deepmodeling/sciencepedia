All necessary data and definitions are provided, and there are no contradictions or factual errors. The problem asks for the derivation of the bulk Richardson number, $Ri_b$, and its computation for a given atmospheric state. This is a standard problem in boundary-layer meteorology and numerical modeling.\n\nThe derivation begins with the definition of the gradient Richardson number, $Ri_g$, which is the ratio of the squared Brunt–Väisälä frequency, $N^2$, to the squared vertical shear of the horizontal wind, $S^2$.\n$$\nRi_g = \\frac{N^2}{S^2}\n$$\nThe problem specifies the forms for $N^2$ and $S^2$ for a dry atmosphere:\n$$\nN^2 = \\left(\\frac{g}{\\theta}\\right)\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial z}\n$$\n$$\nS^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial z}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial z}\\right)^2\n$$\nwhere $g$ is the gravitational acceleration, $\\theta$ is the potential temperature, $z$ is the vertical coordinate, and $(u, v)$ are the horizontal wind components.\n\nTo obtain the bulk Richardson number, $Ri_b$, for a finite layer of thickness $\\Delta z$, we approximate the continuous derivatives with finite differences. The problem assumes linear profiles of $\\theta$, $u$, and $v$ across the layer, which justifies this approximation.\n\nFirst, we approximate the stability term, $N^2$. The vertical gradient of potential temperature, $\\frac{\\partial \\theta}{\\partial z}$, is approximated by the finite difference $\\frac{\\Delta \\theta}{\\Delta z}$, where $\\Delta \\theta = \\theta_2 - \\theta_1$ and $\\Delta z = z_2 - z_1$. The potential temperature $\\theta$ in the denominator of the term $\\frac{g}{\\theta}$ is a representative value for the entire layer. The problem specifies using the layer-mean potential temperature, $\\theta_{\\mathrm{bar}} = \\frac{\\theta_1 + \\theta_2}{2}$.\nThus, the bulk approximation of $N^2$ is:\n$$\nN^2 \\approx \\frac{g}{\\theta_{\\mathrm{bar}}} \\frac{\\Delta \\theta}{\\Delta z}\n$$\nNext, we approximate the shear term, $S^2$.

The critical Richardson number is given as $Ri_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 0.25$. The computed bulk Richardson number is $Ri_b \\approx 0.1256$. Since $Ri_b  Ri_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, the stabilizing effect of buoyancy (represented by $N^2$) is weaker than the destabilizing effect of vertical wind shear (represented by $S^2$). Therefore, the flow is considered dynamically unstable, and shear-driven turbulence is likely to be generated within this layer.",

This requires solving the inequality:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{N_0}{S_0}\\right)^2 \\frac{1}{\\left[1 + \\beta \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi z}{H}\\right)\\right]^2}  \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\nFirst, we compute the value of the dimensionless constant term $\\left(\\frac{N_0}{S_0}\\right)^2$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{N_0}{S_0}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{2.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\nThis specific choice of parameters greatly simplifies the inequality to:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\left[1 + \\beta \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi z}{H}\\right)\\right]^2}  \\frac{1}{4}\n$$\nThe denominator term, $1 + \\beta \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi z}{H}\\right)$, with $\\beta=0.6$, ranges from a minimum of $1 - 0.6 = 0.4$ to a maximum of $1 + 0.6 = 1.6$. Since this term is never zero and is strictly positive, its square is also strictly positive. We can multiply both sides of the inequality by $4$ and by the denominator without changing the direction of the inequality sign:\n$$\n1  \\left[1 + \\beta \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi z}{H}\\right)\\right]^2\n$$\nThis is equivalent to the absolute value inequality:\n$$\n\\left|1 + \\beta \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi z}{H}\\right)\\right|  1\n$$\nThis inequality holds if either of the following two conditions is met:\n1. $1 + \\beta \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi z}{H}\\right)  1$\n2. $1 + \\beta \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi z}{H}\\right)  -1$\n\nLet's analyze the first case:\n$$\n\\beta \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi z}{H}\\right)  0\n$$\nSince $\\beta = 0.6$ is a positive constant, this simplifies to:\n$$\n\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi z}{H}\\right)  0\n$$\n\nNow, let's analyze the second case:\n$$\n\\beta \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi z}{H}\\right)  -2 \\implies \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi z}{H}\\right)  -\\frac{2}{\\beta}\n$$\nSubstituting the value $\\beta = 0.6$:\n$$\n\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi z}{H}\\right)  -\\frac{2}{0.6} = -\\frac{10}{3} \\approx -3.33\n$$\nSince the range of the sine function is $[-1, 1]$, there is no real value of $z$ for which this condition can be satisfied.\n\nThus, the sole condition for the flow to be susceptible to instability is $\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi z}{H}\\right)  0$. We must find the values of $z \\in [0, H]$ that satisfy this.\nLet us introduce a dimensionless height variable $\\theta = \\frac{2\\pi z}{H}$. As $z$ sweeps the interval $[0, H]$, $\\theta$ sweeps the interval $[0, 2\\pi]$. The inequality becomes $\\sin(\\theta)  0$.\nWithin the interval $\\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi]$, the sine function is positive when its argument is in the first or second quadrants, which corresponds to the open interval:\n$$\n0  \\theta  \\pi\n$$\nTo find the corresponding range for the physical height $z$, we substitute back $\\theta = \\frac{2\\pi z}{H}$:\n$$\n0  \\frac{2\\pi z}{H}  \\pi\n$$\nTo isolate $z$, we multiply all parts of the inequality by $\\frac{H}{2\\pi}$ (a positive quantity):\n$$\n0 \\cdot \\frac{H}{2\\pi}  z \\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{H} \\cdot \\frac{H}{2\\pi}  \\pi \\cdot \\frac{H}{2\\pi}\n$$\n$$\n0  z  \\frac{H}{2}\n$$\nThis gives the single continuous layer where the instability criterion is met. The vertical thickness of this layer is the length of this interval. Let $\\Delta z$ be this thickness.\n$$\n\\Delta z = \\frac{H}{2} - 0 = \\frac{H}{2}\n$$\nThe problem provides the total depth $H = 2.0 \\times 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{m}$. Substituting this value:\n$$\n\\Delta z = \\frac{2.0 \\times 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{m}}{2} = 1.0 \\times 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThis is equal to $1000 \\ \\mathrm{m}$. The problem requests the final numerical answer to be rounded to four significant figures. Expressing $1000$ to four significant figures requires the use of scientific notation or a decimal point. Following the specified output format, this becomes $1.000 \\times 10^3$.",
