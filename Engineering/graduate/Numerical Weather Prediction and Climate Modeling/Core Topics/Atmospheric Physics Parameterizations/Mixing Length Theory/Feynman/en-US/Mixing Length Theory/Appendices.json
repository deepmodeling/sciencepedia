            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of boundary layer meteorology and turbulence modeling, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is expressed in objective, precise language. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of an expression for the eddy viscosity for momentum, $K_{m}(z)$, its evaluation at specified heights, and a qualitative description of the resulting mean wind profile. The derivation will be based on three fundamental definitions: the relationship between turbulent momentum flux and friction velocity, the definition of eddy viscosity, and the mixing-length hypothesis.\n\nFirst, let's state the fundamental relationships for a neutrally stratified boundary layer.\n$1$. The magnitude of the turbulent momentum flux, or Reynolds stress, $\\tau$, is constant with height in the surface layer and is defined by the friction velocity, $u_*$:\n$$\n\\tau = \\rho u_*^2\n$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the air density.\n\n$2$. The eddy viscosity for momentum, $K_m$, provides a first-order closure by relating the momentum flux to the mean velocity gradient, $\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial z}$:\n$$\n\\tau = \\rho K_m \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial z}\n$$\nHere, $U$ is the mean horizontal wind speed and $z$ is the height.\n\n$3$. The mixing-length hypothesis, as proposed by Prandtl, models the momentum flux in terms of a mixing length, $l$, and the mean velocity gradient:\n$$\n\\tau = \\rho l^2 \\left| \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial z} \\right| \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial z}\n$$\nIn a typical planetary boundary layer, the wind speed increases with height, so $\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial z} > 0$. The expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\tau = \\rho l^2 \\left( \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial z} \\right)^2\n$$\n\nTo derive the expression for $K_m(z)$, we first equate the first and third expressions for $\\tau$:\n$$\n\\rho u_*^2 = \\rho l^2 \\left( \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial z} \\right)^2\n$$\nSolving for the wind shear, $\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial z}$, yields:\n$$\nu_* = l \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial z} \\implies \\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial z} = \\frac{u_*}{l(z)}\n$$\nThis relationship shows that the wind shear is determined by the friction velocity and the mixing length.\n\nNext, we substitute the expressions for $\\tau$ from the first definition and for $\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial z}$ into the second definition (the definition of eddy viscosity):\n$$\n\\rho u_*^2 = \\rho K_m \\left( \\frac{u_*}{l(z)} \\right)\n$$\nAssuming $u_* > 0$, we can divide both sides by $\\rho u_*$:\n$$\nu_* = \\frac{K_m}{l(z)}\n$$\nSolving for $K_m$ gives the desired expression in terms of $u_*$ and $l(z)$:\n$$\nK_m(z) = u_* l(z)\n$$\nThe problem specifies the mixing length as $l(z) = \\min\\{\\kappa z, l_{\\infty}\\}$. Therefore, the full expression for the eddy viscosity is:\n$$\nK_m(z) = u_* \\min\\{\\kappa z, l_{\\infty}\\}\n$$\nNow, we evaluate $K_m(z)$ at the given grid levels $z = [10, 50, 100, 200, 400]\\,\\mathrm{m}$, using the provided constants $u_* = 0.50\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$, $\\kappa = 0.40$, and $l_{\\infty} = 150\\,\\mathrm{m}$. The results are to be rounded to four significant figures and expressed in $\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}$.\n\nFor each height $z$, we first calculate the mixing length $l(z)$:\n- At $z=10\\,\\mathrm{m}$:\n  $l(10) = \\min\\{0.40 \\times 10, 150\\} = \\min\\{4.0, 150\\} = 4.0\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n  $K_m(10) = 0.50 \\times 4.0 = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}$\n\n- At $z=50\\,\\mathrm{m}$:\n  $l(50) = \\min\\{0.40 \\times 50, 150\\} = \\min\\{20.0, 150\\} = 20.0\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n  $K_m(50) = 0.50 \\times 20.0 = 10.0\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}$\n\n- At $z=100\\,\\mathrm{m}$:\n  $l(100) = \\min\\{0.40 \\times 100, 150\\} = \\min\\{40.0, 150\\} = 40.0\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n  $K_m(100) = 0.50 \\times 40.0 = 20.0\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}$\n\n- At $z=200\\,\\mathrm{m}$:\n  $l(200) = \\min\\{0.40 \\times 200, 150\\} = \\min\\{80.0, 150\\} = 80.0\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n  $K_m(200) = 0.50 \\times 80.0 = 40.0\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}$\n\n- At $z=400\\,\\mathrm{m}$:\n  The capping of the mixing length becomes effective when $\\kappa z \\ge l_{\\infty}$, which occurs at $z \\ge \\frac{l_{\\infty}}{\\kappa} = \\frac{150}{0.40} = 375\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n  Since $400\\,\\mathrm{m} > 375\\,\\mathrm{m}$, the mixing length is capped.\n  $l(400) = \\min\\{0.40 \\times 400, 150\\} = \\min\\{160.0, 150\\} = 150.0\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n  $K_m(400) = 0.50 \\times 150.0 = 75.0\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}$\n\nRounding these values to four significant figures yields:\n$K_m(10) = 2.000\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}$\n$K_m(50) = 10.00\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}$\n$K_m(100) = 20.00\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}$\n$K_m(200) = 40.00\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}$\n$K_m(400) = 75.00\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}$\n\nFinally, we describe the expected qualitative shape of the mean wind speed profile, $U(z)$. The shape is determined by the vertical wind shear, $\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial z}$, which we derived as:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial z} = \\frac{u_*}{l(z)}\n$$\nThe wind profile $U(z)$ is obtained by integrating this expression.\n- For heights where $z  375\\,\\mathrm{m}$, the mixing length is $l(z)=\\kappa z$. The shear is $\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial z} = \\frac{u_*}{\\kappa z}$. Integrating this expression with respect to $z$ gives $U(z) = \\frac{u_*}{\\kappa} \\ln\\left(\\frac{z}{z_0}\\right)$, where $z_0$ is the aerodynamic roughness length. This is the classic logarithmic wind profile, where wind speed increases with height, but the rate of increase (the shear) diminishes with height. This applies to the grid levels at $10$, $50$, $100$, and $200\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n- For heights where $z \\ge 375\\,\\mathrm{m}$, the mixing length is capped at a constant value, $l(z) = l_{\\infty}$. The shear becomes constant: $\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial z} = \\frac{u_*}{l_{\\infty}}$. Integration yields a linear wind profile, $U(z) = \\left(\\frac{u_*}{l_{\\infty}}\\right)z + C$, where C is a constant of integration. This applies to the grid level at $400\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n\nTherefore, the expected qualitative shape of the mean wind speed profile $U(z)$ shows the wind speed increasing with height across all levels. The wind shear, or the rate of increase of wind speed, decreases with height up to $z = 375\\,\\mathrm{m}$ (logarithmic region), after which the shear becomes constant for all greater heights (linear region).",
