The process involves two cycles of analysis (update) and forecast (prediction).\n\n**1) Analysis at time $t_1$**\n\nThe analysis state (posterior) is obtained by combining the background state (prior) with the observation. The background is $x_1 \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_1^b, P_1^b)$ and the observation model implies a likelihood $p(y_1|x_1) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(y_1; x_1, \\sigma_o^2)$. Since the prior and likelihood are Gaussian, the posterior is also a Gaussian, $x_1|y_1 \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_1^a, P_1^a)$, with variance $P_1^a$ and mean $\\mu_1^a$ given by:\n$$P_1^a = \\left( \\frac{1}{P_1^b} + \\frac{1}{\\sigma_o^2} \\right)^{-1} = \\frac{P_1^b \\sigma_o^2}{P_1^b + \\sigma_o^2}$$\n$$\\mu_1^a = P_1^a \\left( \\frac{\\mu_1^b}{P_1^b} + \\frac{y_1}{\\sigma_o^2} \\right)$$\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n$P_1^b = 4.0$, $\\sigma_o^2 = 1.0$, $\\mu_1^b = 0.0$, $y_1 = 0.8$.\n\nThe analysis variance at $t_1$ is:\n$$P_1^a = \\frac{4.0 \\times 1.0}{4.0 + 1.0} = \\frac{4.0}{5.0} = 0.8$$\nThe analysis mean at $t_1$ is:\n$$\\mu_1^a = 0.8 \\left( \\frac{0.0}{4.0} + \\frac{0.8}{1.0} \\right) = 0.8 \\times 0.8 = 0.64$$\nSo, the analysis state at $t_1$ is $(\\mu_1^a, P_1^a) = (0.64, 0.8)$.\n\n**2) Forecast to $t_2$ and Analysis at $t_2$**\n\nFirst, we propagate the analysis state from $t_1$ to $t_2$ using the model dynamics $x_{k+1} = x_k + \\eta_k$. This yields the background state for the next analysis at $t_2$.\nThe mean is propagated as:\n$$\\mu_2^b = E[x_1 + \\eta_1] = E[x_1] + E[\\eta_1] = \\mu_1^a + 0 = 0.64$$\nThe variance is propagated as (since $x_1$ and $\\eta_1$ are independent):\n$$P_2^b = \\text{Var}(x_1 + \\eta_1) = \\text{Var}(x_1) + \\text{Var}(\\eta_1) = P_1^a + \\sigma_m^2$$\nSubstituting the values $P_1^a = 0.8$ and $\\sigma_m^2 = 0.25$:\n$$P_2^b = 0.8 + 0.25 = 1.05$$\nSo, the background state at $t_2$ is $(\\mu_2^b, P_2^b) = (0.64, 1.05)$.\n\nNext, we perform the analysis at $t_2$ using the new background $(\\mu_2^b, P_2^b)$ and the new observation $y_2 = 0.3$. The equations are identical in form to the first analysis step.\nThe analysis variance at $t_2$ is:\n$$P_2^a = \\frac{P_2^b \\sigma_o^2}{P_2^b + \\sigma_o^2} = \\frac{1.05 \\times 1.0}{1.05 + 1.0} = \\frac{1.05}{2.05}$$\nThe analysis mean at $t_2$ is:\n$$\\mu_2^a = P_2^a \\left( \\frac{\\mu_2^b}{P_2^b} + \\frac{y_2}{\\sigma_o^2} \\right) = \\frac{1.05}{2.05} \\left( \\frac{0.64}{1.05} + \\frac{0.3}{1.0} \\right) = \\frac{1.05}{2.05} \\left( \\frac{0.64 + 0.3 \\times 1.05}{1.05} \\right) = \\frac{0.64 + 0.315}{2.05} = \\frac{0.955}{2.05}$$\nThe problem does not require the numerical values of $\\mu_2^a$ and $P_2^a$ for the final answer, so we can leave them as exact fractions for now.\n\n**3) Variance Reductions and Ratio**\n\nThe variance reduction at each step is the difference between the background (forecast) variance and the analysis variance.\nFor $t_1$:\n$$\\Delta_1 = P_1^b - P_1^a = 4.0 - 0.8 = 3.2$$\nFor $t_2$:\n$$\\Delta_2 = P_2^b - P_2^a = 1.05 - \\frac{1.05}{2.05} = 1.05 \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{2.05} \\right) = 1.05 \\left( \\frac{2.05 - 1.0}{2.05} \\right) = 1.05 \\left( \\frac{1.05}{2.05} \\right) = \\frac{1.1025}{2.05}$$\nNow, we compute the ratio $\\rho = \\Delta_2 / \\Delta_1$:\n$$\\rho = \\frac{\\Delta_2}{\\Delta_1} = \\frac{1.1025 / 2.05}{3.2} = \\frac{1.1025}{2.05 \\times 3.2} = \\frac{1.1025}{6.56}$$\nPerforming the final division:\n$$\\rho \\approx 0.168064024...$$\nRounding to four significant figures, as requested:\n$$\\rho \\approx 0.1681$$\nThe result quantifies the diminishing information gain from successive observations when model error inflates the uncertainty between observation times. The second observation reduces variance by only about $16.8\\%$ as much as the first.",

            "solution": "The problem statement has been analyzed and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of Bayesian inference and the Kalman filter, which are foundational to data assimilation in numerical weather prediction. The problem is well-posed, objective, and self-contained, with all necessary parameters and definitions provided for a unique and meaningful solution.\n\nHerein, we derive the required formulas and compute the results for the given test cases.\n\n### 1. Derivation of the Scalar Analysis Variance ($P_a$)\n\nWe are given a scalar system. The prior belief about the state $x$ is given by the forecast distribution, which is a Gaussian with mean $m_f$ and variance $P_f$, denoted as $x \\sim \\mathcal{N}(m_f, P_f)$. The probability density function is:\n$$\np(x) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{(x - m_f)^2}{P_f}\\right)\n$$\nAn observation $y$ is made, related to the state $x$ through the linear observation model $y = Hx + \\varepsilon$. We are given $H=1$ and the observation error $\\varepsilon$ follows a Gaussian distribution $\\varepsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, R)$. This defines the likelihood function, which is the probability of observing $y$ given a state $x$:\n$$\np(y|x) = \\mathcal{N}(y; Hx, R) = \\mathcal{N}(y; x, R) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{(y - x)^2}{R}\\right)\n$$\nAccording to Bayes' theorem, the posterior distribution of the state $x$ given the observation $y$, known as the analysis distribution $p(x|y)$, is proportional to the product of the likelihood and the prior:\n$$\np(x|y) \\propto p(y|x) p(x)\n$$\nSince the product of two Gaussian distributions is another Gaussian, the analysis distribution is also Gaussian, $x|y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(m_a, P_a)$. Its probability density is proportional to:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{(x - m_f)^2}{P_f}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\frac{(x - y)^2}{R}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{(x - m_f)^2}{P_f} + \\frac{(x - y)^2}{R} \\right]\\right)\n$$\nTo find the analysis variance $P_a$, we can examine the terms in the exponent that are quadratic in $x$. The exponent of a Gaussian $\\mathcal{N}(m_a, P_a)$ has a term $-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{x^2}{P_a}$. Expanding the quadratic terms from the expression above gives:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{x^2}{P_f} + \\frac{x^2}{R} + \\dots \\right) = -\\frac{1}{2} x^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{P_f} + \\frac{1}{R} \\right) + \\dots\n$$\nBy comparing the coefficients of the $x^2$ term, we find that the inverse of the analysis variance is the sum of the inverses of the forecast and observation error variances:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{P_a} = \\frac{1}{P_f} + \\frac{1}{R}\n$$\nThis fundamental relationship shows that in a linear Gaussian system, precisions (inverse variances) add. Solving for the analysis variance $P_a$, we get:\n$$\nP_a = \\left( \\frac{R + P_f}{P_f R} \\right)^{-1} = \\frac{P_f R}{P_f + R}\n$$\nThis is the standard formula for the analysis variance in a scalar Kalman filter update.\n\n### 2. Effect of Inflation and Derivation of the Inflated Analysis Variance ($P_a'$)\n\nEnsemble inflation schemes are designed to modify the forecast ensemble statistics before the assimilation step. Let the original forecast ensemble members be $\\{x_f^{(i)}\\}$, which have a sample variance of approximately $P_f$.\n\n**Multiplicative Inflation:** Each member's deviation from the mean is scaled by $\\sqrt{\\alpha}$. A member $x_f^{(i)}$ is transformed to $x_f'^{(i)}$:\n$$\nx_f'^{(i)} = m_f + \\sqrt{\\alpha}(x_f^{(i)} - m_f)\n$$\nThe variance of this new ensemble, $P_f'$, is:\n$$\nP_f' = \\text{Var}(x_f'^{(i)}) = \\text{Var}(m_f + \\sqrt{\\alpha}(x_f^{(i)} - m_f)) = (\\sqrt{\\alpha})^2 \\text{Var}(x_f^{(i)}) = \\alpha P_f\n$$\nThis confirms the problem's definition for multiplicative inflation.\n\n**Additive Inflation:** Independent random noise $\\delta^{(i)} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\beta)$ is added to each ensemble member:\n$$\nx_f'^{(i)} = x_f^{(i)} + \\delta^{(i)}\n$$\nSince the added noise is independent of the forecast state, the variances add. The variance of the new ensemble, $P_f'$, is:\n$$\nP_f' = \\text{Var}(x_f'^{(i)}) = \\text{Var}(x_f^{(i)} + \\delta^{(i)}) = \\text{Var}(x_f^{(i)}) + \\text{Var}(\\delta^{(i)}) = P_f + \\beta\n$$\nThis confirms the problem's definition for additive inflation.\n\n**Sequential Inflation:** When multiplicative inflation (with parameter $\\alpha$) is followed by additive inflation (with parameter $\\beta$), the transformations are composed. The variance after the first step is $\\alpha P_f$. The second step adds $\\beta$ to this variance. Thus, the final inflated forecast variance is:\n$$\nP_f' = \\alpha P_f + \\beta\n$$\nThe analysis step then proceeds using this inflated forecast variance $P_f'$ as the prior variance.

The background (first-guess) state is $x_b \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, the forecast model propagates the analysis $x_a \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ to the forecast time via a linear operator $M \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$, and the observation operator is $H \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$.

The first-order optimality condition $\\nabla_x J_a(x) = 0$ yields the normal equations\n$$\nB^{-1}(x - x_b) - H^\\top R^{-1} (y - H x) = 0,\n$$\nwhich can be rearranged as\n$$\n\\left(B^{-1} + H^\\top R^{-1} H\\right)x = B^{-1} x_b + H^\\top R^{-1} y.\n$$\nSolving for $x$ gives the analysis $x_a$.

To find the gradient with respect to the observations $y$, we apply the chain rule through the analysis–forecast mapping.

It is computationally efficient because it involves transposed operators and avoids explicit perturbations in observation space.\n\nAlgorithmic steps for each test case:\n1. Compute the Kalman gain $K = B H^\\top (H B H^\\top + R)^{-1}$. Let $S = H B H^\\top + R$; since $S$ is symmetric positive-definite, $S^{-1}$ exists and can be stably computed.\n2. Compute the analysis $x_a = x_b + K (y - H x_b)$.\n3. Propagate to the forecast $x_f = M x_a$.\n4. Form the forecast-space gradient $\\nabla_{x_f} J_f = W (x_f - x_t)$.\n5. Back-propagate to observation space via the adjoint to obtain $\\nabla_y J_f = K^\\top M^\\top \\nabla_{x_f} J_f$.\n6. Round the two components of $\\nabla_y J_f$ to six decimal places and collect them as the output for the test case.\n\nInterpretation of signs and magnitudes of $\\nabla_y J_f$:\n- If the $i$-th component of $\\nabla_y J_f$ is positive, a positive perturbation to the $i$-th observation tends to increase $J_f$, worsening the forecast metric under the given $W$; a negative gradient implies that increasing the $i$-th observation decreases $J_f$, improving the metric.\n- The magnitude of each component indicates the sensitivity strength: larger absolute values imply that small changes in the corresponding observation produce larger changes in $J_f$.\n- Increasing observation error variance (larger entries in $R$) reduces the gain $K$ and thus diminishes sensitivity magnitudes; conversely, very small $R$ increases sensitivity magnitudes. If $W$ is the zero matrix, then $\\nabla_y J_f = 0$, reflecting that the forecast metric does not penalize any forecast departures.\n\nThe program will implement these steps for the five specified test cases and produce the single-line output as required.",
