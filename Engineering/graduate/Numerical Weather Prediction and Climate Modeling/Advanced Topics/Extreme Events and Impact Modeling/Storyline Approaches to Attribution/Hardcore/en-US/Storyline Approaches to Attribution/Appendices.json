            "solution": "The problem requires us to first derive an expression for the fractional sensitivity of saturation vapor pressure, $\\gamma(T)$, and then evaluate it under different temperature regimes.\n\nThe starting point is the differential form of the Clausius-Clapeyron relation, which describes the temperature dependence of saturation vapor pressure, $e_s$. Under the standard approximations that the specific volume of the liquid phase is negligible compared to the vapor phase and that water vapor behaves as an ideal gas, the relation is:\n$$\n\\frac{d e_{s}}{dT} = \\frac{L_{v} e_{s}}{R_{v} T^{2}}\n$$\nHere, $L_{v}$ is the latent heat of vaporization, $R_{v}$ is the specific gas constant for water vapor, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe fractional sensitivity, $\\gamma(T)$, is defined as:\n$$\n\\gamma(T) \\equiv \\frac{1}{e_{s}(T)}\\frac{d e_{s}(T)}{dT}\n$$\nTo find the expression for $\\gamma(T)$, we substitute the Clausius-Clapeyron relation into this definition:\n$$\n\\gamma(T) = \\frac{1}{e_{s}(T)} \\left( \\frac{L_{v} e_{s}(T)}{R_{v} T^{2}} \\right)\n$$\nThe term $e_{s}(T)$ cancels, yielding the aforementioned expression for $\\gamma(T)$ in terms of $L_{v}$, $R_{v}$, and $T$:\n$$\n\\gamma(T) = \\frac{L_{v}}{R_{v} T^{2}}\n$$\nThis expression shows that, under the assumption of a constant $L_{v}$, the fractional sensitivity is not constant but is inversely proportional to the square of the absolute temperature.\n\nNext, we evaluate $\\gamma(T)$ at the specified temperatures using the provided constants:\n$L_{v} = 2.50 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{kg}^{-1}$\n$R_{v} = 461\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{kg}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$\n\nFor the cold regime, $T_{c} = 260\\,\\text{K}$:\n$$\n\\gamma(T_{c}) = \\frac{2.50 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{kg}^{-1}}{(461\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{kg}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}) (260\\,\\text{K})^{2}} = \\frac{2.50 \\times 10^{6}}{461 \\times 67600}\\,\\text{K}^{-1} \\approx 0.080222\\,\\text{K}^{-1}\n$$\n\nFor the warm regime, $T_{w} = 300\\,\\text{K}$:\n$$\n\\gamma(T_{w}) = \\frac{2.50 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{kg}^{-1}}{(461\\,\\text{J}\\,\\text{kg}^{-1}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}) (300\\,\\text{K})^{2}} = \\frac{2.50 \\times 10^{6}}{461 \\times 90000}\\,\\text{K}^{-1} \\approx 0.060255\\,\\text{K}^{-1}\n$$\n\nNow, we compute the departures, $\\Delta_{c}$ and $\\Delta_{w}$, from the canonical heuristic value of $0.07\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$:\n$$\n\\Delta_{c} = |\\gamma(T_{c}) - 0.07\\,\\text{K}^{-1}| = |0.080222... - 0.07|\\,\\text{K}^{-1} = 0.010222...\\,\\text{K}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta_{w} = |\\gamma(T_{w}) - 0.07\\,\\text{K}^{-1}| = |0.060255... - 0.07|\\,\\text{K}^{-1} = |-0.009744...|\\,\\text{K}^{-1} = 0.009744...\\,\\text{K}^{-1}\n$$\n\nFinally, we compute the warm-to-cold departure ratio, $Q$:\n$$\nQ = \\frac{\\Delta_{w}}{\\Delta_{c}} = \\frac{0.009744...}{0.010222...} \\approx 0.95325\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $Q \\approx 0.9533$.\n\n**Implications for Storyline-Based Event Attribution**\n\nThe derivation and calculations reveal a critical nuance missed by the constant $7\\%\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$ heuristic. The fractional sensitivity of saturation vapor pressure, $\\gamma(T)$, is a decreasing function of temperature, scaling as $T^{-2}$.\n\n1.  **In Cold Regimes**: At $T_c = 260\\,\\text{K}$ (around $-13^\\circ\\text{C}$), the calculated sensitivity is $\\gamma(T_c) \\approx 8.0\\%\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$. This is significantly higher than the canonical $7\\%\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$. For a storyline approach analyzing an extreme precipitation event in a cold environment (e.g., an atmospheric river event in winter or a storm in a high-latitude region), this implies that for each degree of background warming, the thermodynamic \"fuel\" for the storm—atmospheric moisture content, as limited by $e_s$—increases more substantially than the heuristic suggests. Using the $7\\%\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$ rule would thus *underestimate* the thermodynamic contribution of climate warming to the event's intensity.\n\n2.  **In Warm Regimes**: At $T_w = 300\\,\\text{K}$ (around $27^\\circ\\text{C}$), the sensitivity is $\\gamma(T_w) \\approx 6.0\\%\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$, which is lower than the heuristic. For a storyline analyzing a very warm event (e.g., a hurricane or a summer convective storm), this implies the moisture increase per degree of warming is less than the standard $7\\%$. Applying the heuristic in this case would *overestimate* the purely thermodynamic contribution to the event's intensification.\n\nIn summary, the assumption of a constant CC scaling is a source of state-dependent error. Storyline attributions that aim for physical consistency must account for this temperature dependence. The common heuristic is most accurate at typical mid-latitude temperatures (around $278\\,\\text{K}$ or $5^\\circ\\text{C}$) but becomes progressively less accurate at the temperature extremes where many high-impact weather events occur. Failing to account for the $T^{-2}$ dependence risks misattributing the role of warming, either by understating its thermodynamic effect on cold-weather extremes or overstating it for warm-weather extremes, assuming no changes in atmospheric dynamics. This highlights the value of moving from simplified heuristics to direct physical calculations, even within a narrative framework.",

The absolute event shows a physically extreme and very rare event ($1$-in-$2300$) becoming much more probable ($1$-in-$260$), representing a large *relative* amplification. These two perspectives (\"what was rare is now more common\" vs. \"what was almost impossible is now possible\") are indeed different but complementary storylines in attribution.\n\nThe other options contain numerical or conceptual errors.
