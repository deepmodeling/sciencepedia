The problem provides the asymptotic convergence factor, $\\rho$, defined as the ratio of the norms of successive residual vectors. For a linear stationary iterative method, this relationship is expressed as:\n$$ \\frac{\\|r_i\\|}{\\|r_{i-1}\\|} \\approx \\rho $$\nBy repeated application of this relation, we can express the norm of the residual after $k$ cycles, $\\|r_k\\|$, in terms of the initial residual norm, $\\|r_0\\|$:\n$$ \\|r_k\\| \\approx \\rho^k \\|r_0\\| $$\nWe will treat this approximation as an equality for the purpose of this analysis, which is standard for estimating iteration counts based on an asymptotic factor.\n\nThe problem specifies the target for the residual reduction:\n$$ \\|r_k\\| \\le 10^{-8} \\|r_0\\| $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\|r_k\\|$ into this inequality yields:\n$$ \\rho^k \\|r_0\\| \\le 10^{-8} \\|r_0\\| $$\nGiven that the initial residual must be non-zero for the problem to be meaningful (i.e., $\\|r_0\\| > 0$), we can divide both sides by $\\|r_0\\|$:\n$$ \\rho^k \\le 10^{-8} $$\nThe given convergence factor is $\\rho = 0.12$.
