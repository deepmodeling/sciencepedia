This practice guides you through a foundational calculation using a simplified box model of the marine boundary layer, a common tool for back-of-the-envelope estimates. By performing a mass balance calculation that accounts for the aerosol source, mixing with the background environment, and deposition to the surface, you will determine the necessary source strength to sustain a target CCN concentration .

The problem is self-contained, with all necessary parameters provided for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The numerical values are explicitly stated as \"scientifically plausible,\" and they are indeed within the typical ranges observed for these physical quantities. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation and Solution\nWe proceed with solving the validated problem.\n\nThe governing equation for the CCN number concentration $N(t)$ is based on the principle of mass conservation within the well-mixed boundary layer volume $V=Ah$.

This process is modeled by the term $k_m (N_0 - N(t))$. If $N(t) > N_0$, this term is negative (a sink), and if $N(t) < N_0$, it is positive (a source of background particles).\n\nThe sink term from dry deposition is given as a volumetric sink of $(v_d/h) N(t)$. This term is always a sink, so it enters the equation with a negative sign.\n\nCombining these terms, the differential equation for $N(t)$ is:\n$$ \\frac{dN}{dt} = \\frac{F_s}{h} + k_m (N_0 - N(t)) - \\frac{v_d}{h} N(t) $$\n\nThe problem requires a steady-state solution, which means the concentration is no longer changing with time. We set $\\frac{dN}{dt} = 0$ and denote the steady-state concentration as $N_{ss}$.\n$$ 0 = \\frac{F_s}{h} + k_m (N_0 - N_{ss}) - \\frac{v_d}{h} N_{ss} $$\n\nThe desired steady-state concentration $N_{ss}$ is a prescribed increase $\\Delta N_{\\mathrm{CCN}}$ above the background $N_0$:\n$$ N_{ss} = N_0 + \\Delta N_{\\mathrm{CCN}} $$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $N_{ss}$ into the steady-state equation:\n$$ 0 = \\frac{F_s}{h} + k_m (N_0 - (N_0 + \\Delta N_{\\mathrm{CCN}})) - \\frac{v_d}{h} (N_0 + \\Delta N_{\\mathrm{CCN}}) $$\n$$ 0 = \\frac{F_s}{h} + k_m (-\\Delta N_{\\mathrm{CCN}}) - \\frac{v_d}{h} (N_0 + \\Delta N_{\\mathrm{CCN}}) $$\n\nWe now solve for the area source flux $F_s$:\n$$ \\frac{F_s}{h} = k_m \\Delta N_{\\mathrm{CCN}} + \\frac{v_d}{h} (N_0 + \\Delta N_{\\mathrm{CCN}}) $$\n$$ F_s = h \\left( k_m \\Delta N_{\\mathrm{CCN}} + \\frac{v_d}{h} (N_0 + \\Delta N_{\\mathrm{CCN}}) \\right) $$\n$$ F_s = k_m h \\Delta N_{\\mathrm{CCN}} + v_d (N_0 + \\Delta N_{\\mathrm{CCN}}) $$\n\nThe problem asks for the total bulk emission rate $\\Phi$ in units of $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, which is the total number of particles emitted per second over the entire area $A$.

Since $\\omega = \\frac{2\\pi}{T}$, we have $\\mathrm{d}t = \\frac{T}{2\\pi}\\,\\mathrm{d}h$.\n\nThe integration over a full day ($t \\in [0, T]$) with a non-zero integrand only during daylight corresponds to an integration over the hour angle from sunrise to sunset, which is given as $h \\in [-H_0, H_0]$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Delta F(t)$ and changing the integration variable to $h$:\n$$\n\\overline{\\Delta F} = \\frac{1}{T}\\int_{-H_0}^{H_0} \\left(- S \\mu_0(h) \\Delta \\alpha A\\right) \\left(\\frac{T}{2\\pi}\\,\\mathrm{d}h\\right)\n$$\nThe period $T$ cancels out:\n$$\n\\overline{\\Delta F} = -\\frac{S \\Delta \\alpha A}{2\\pi} \\int_{-H_0}^{H_0} \\mu_0(h)\\,\\mathrm{d}h\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $\\mu_0(h)$:\n$$\n\\mu_0(h) = \\sin\\phi \\sin\\delta + \\cos\\phi \\cos\\delta \\cos h(t)\n$$\nThe problem states it is an equinox day, for which the solar declination is $\\delta = 0$. This simplifies $\\mu_0(h)$ significantly:\n$$\n\\mu_0(h) = \\sin\\phi \\sin(0) + \\cos\\phi \\cos(0) \\cos h = 0 + \\cos\\phi \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\cos h = \\cos\\phi \\cos h\n$$\nOn an equinox, daylight lasts for $12$ hours everywhere on Earth, so the sunrise hour angle is $-\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and the sunset hour angle is $\\frac{\\pi}{2}$. The problem confirms this by stating $H_0 = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$.\n\nNow we can evaluate the definite integral:\n$$\n\\int_{-H_0}^{H_0} \\mu_0(h)\\,\\mathrm{d}h = \\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2} \\cos\\phi \\cos h\\,\\mathrm{d}h\n$$\nSince $\\cos\\phi$ is constant with respect to $h$, we can pull it out of the integral:\n$$\n\\cos\\phi \\int_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2} \\cos h\\,\\mathrm{d}h = \\cos\\phi \\left[\\sin h\\right]_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2}\n$$\nEvaluating the integral at the limits:\n$$\n\\cos\\phi \\left(\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) - \\sin\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right)\\right) = \\cos\\phi (1 - (-1)) = 2\\cos\\phi\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $\\overline{\\Delta F}$:\n$$\n\\overline{\\Delta F} = -\\frac{S \\Delta \\alpha A}{2\\pi} (2\\cos\\phi)\n$$\nThis simplifies to the final symbolic expression:\n$$\n\\overline{\\Delta F} = -\\frac{S \\Delta \\alpha A \\cos\\phi}{\\pi}\n$$\n\n### Step 3: Numerical Calculation\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into the derived expression:\n- $S = 1361\\,\\text{W m}^{-2}$\n- $\\Delta \\alpha = 0.03$\n- $A = 1.0 \\times 10^{10}\\,\\text{m}^2$\n- $\\phi = 20^{\\circ}\\,\\text{S} = -20^{\\circ}$\n\nThe cosine function is even, so $\\cos(-20^{\\circ}) = \\cos(20^{\\circ})$.\n$$\n\\overline{\\Delta F} = - \\frac{(1361) \\cdot (0.03) \\cdot (1.0 \\times 10^{10}) \\cdot \\cos(20^{\\circ})}{\\pi}\n$$\nFirst, calculate the numerator:\n$$\n(1361) \\cdot (0.03) = 40.83\n$$\n$$\n(40.83) \\cdot (1.0 \\times 10^{10}) = 4.083 \\times 10^{11}\n$$\n$$\n\\cos(20^{\\circ}) \\approx 0.93969262\n$$\nNumerator $\\approx (4.083 \\times 10^{11}) \\cdot (0.93969262) \\approx 3.83679 \\times 10^{11}$\n\nNow divide by $\\pi$:\n$$\n\\overline{\\Delta F} \\approx - \\frac{3.83679 \\times 10^{11}}{\\pi} \\approx -1.22165 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\text{W}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\n\\overline{\\Delta F} \\approx -1.22 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\text{W}\n$$\nThe negative sign correctly indicates a reduction in absorbed solar energy (a net cooling effect) due to the increased albedo.",
