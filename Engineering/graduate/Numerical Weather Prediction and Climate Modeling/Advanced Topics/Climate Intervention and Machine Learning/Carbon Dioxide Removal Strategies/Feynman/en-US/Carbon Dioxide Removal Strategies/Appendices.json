            "problem": "In Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) and climate modeling, Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) strategies must be evaluated against energetic constraints. Consider isothermal, isobaric, reversible separation of carbon dioxide from air in the limit where air is treated as an ideal mixture of ideal gases at atmospheric conditions. Starting from the statistical-mechanical origin of mixing entropy and the thermodynamic definition of the chemical potential for ideal gases, derive an expression for the minimum reversible work per mole of carbon dioxide, denoted by $W_{\\min}(x,T,P)$, required to separate carbon dioxide present at a molar fraction $x$ in air, into a pure carbon dioxide product stream at the same temperature $T$ and pressure $P$, and a carbon-dioxide-depleted air stream. Assume ideal behavior and neglect pressure-volume work beyond that associated with mixing and unmixing at constant $P$.\n\nUse the fundamental base that the reversible work required for separation equals the increase in Gibbs free energy associated with unmixing, and the ideal-gas chemical potential relation $\\mu_{i}(T,p_{i})=\\mu_{i}^{0}(T)+R T \\ln\\!\\big(p_{i}/p^{0}\\big)$, where $p_{i}$ is the partial pressure of species $i$, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $p^{0}$ is a reference pressure that cancels in differences.\n\nThen, numerically evaluate your derived $W_{\\min}$ for an atmosphere with carbon dioxide concentration $C_{\\text{atm}}=x=4.20\\times 10^{-4}$ (that is, $420$ parts per million by volume), at $T=298$ kelvin and $P=1$ bar, using $R=8.314 \\, \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$.

This minimum work, $W_{\\min}$, corresponds to the change in the Gibbs free energy, $\\Delta G$, for this reversible, isothermal, and isobaric process. The process can be conceptualized as extracting one mole of $\\text{CO}_2$ from a very large reservoir of air, such that the composition of the remaining air is effectively unchanged.\n\nThe change in Gibbs free energy for transferring one mole of a substance $i$ from an initial state (in a mixture) to a final state (as a pure substance) is given by the difference in its chemical potential, $\\mu_i$, between the two states.\n\n$W_{\\min} = \\Delta G = G_{\\text{final}} - G_{\\text{initial}} = \\mu_{\\text{CO}_2, \\text{pure}} - \\mu_{\\text{CO}_2, \\text{mix}}$\n\nHere, $\\mu_{\\text{CO}_2, \\text{pure}}$ is the chemical potential of one mole of pure $\\text{CO}_2$ at temperature $T$ and pressure $P$, and $\\mu_{\\text{CO}_2, \\text{mix}}$ is the chemical potential of $\\text{CO}_2$ in the air mixture at temperature $T$ and total pressure $P$.\n\nThe problem provides the expression for the chemical potential of an ideal gas, species $i$, at temperature $T$ and partial pressure $p_i$:\n$$\\mu_{i}(T, p_{i}) = \\mu_{i}^{0}(T) + RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_{i}}{p^{0}}\\right)$$\nwhere $\\mu_{i}^{0}(T)$ is the standard chemical potential at the reference pressure $p^{0}$, and $R$ is the universal gas constant.\n\nIn the initial state, the air is an ideal mixture at total pressure $P$. The partial pressure of $\\text{CO}_2$, present at a molar fraction $x$, is given by Dalton's law: $p_{\\text{CO}_2} = xP$.\nThe chemical potential of $\\text{CO}_2$ in the mixture is therefore:\n$$\\mu_{\\text{CO}_2, \\text{mix}} = \\mu_{\\text{CO}_2}^{0}(T) + RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{xP}{p^{0}}\\right)$$\n\nIn the final state, we have one mole of pure $\\text{CO}_2$ at temperature $T$ and pressure $P$.

The parameters are constrained such that $k_a > 0$, $k_o > 0$, $\\alpha \\ge 0$, and $\\gamma > 0$.\n\nFirst, we determine the steady-state solution, denoted by $(C_a^*, C_o^*)$. At steady state, the time derivatives are zero: $\\frac{dC_a}{dt} = 0$ and $\\frac{dC_o}{dt} = 0$. This yields a system of two linear algebraic equations:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{F_N}{M_a} - k_a \\left(C_a^* - \\alpha C_o^*\\right) \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\n0 = k_o \\left(C_a^* - \\alpha C_o^*\\right) - \\gamma C_o^* \\quad (2)\n$$\n\nFrom equation (2), we can express a relationship between the steady-state concentrations.\n$$\nk_o \\left(C_a^* - \\alpha C_o^*\\right) = \\gamma C_o^*\n$$\nThis equation shows that at steady state, the net air-sea exchange flux into the ocean box (scaled by $k_o$) is balanced by the export flux to the deep ocean.\n\nFrom equation (1), we have:\n$$\nk_a \\left(C_a^* - \\alpha C_o^*\\right) = \\frac{F_N}{M_a}\n$$\nThis indicates that the air-sea exchange flux out of the atmospheric box balances the net anthropogenic source.\n\nWe can solve this system for $C_a^*$ and $C_o^*$. Let's first solve for $C_o^*$ by substituting the term $(C_a^* - \\alpha C_o^*)$ from equation (1) into equation (2). From (1), we have $C_a^* - \\alpha C_o^* = \\frac{F_N}{k_a M_a}$.

Trace condition: $\\text{Tr}(\\mathbf{J}) < 0$\n    We have $\\text{Tr}(\\mathbf{J}) = -(k_a + k_o \\alpha + \\gamma)$.

Therefore, $\\text{Tr}(\\mathbf{J})$ is always negative.\n\n2.  Determinant condition: $\\det(\\mathbf{J}) > 0$\n    We have $\\det(\\mathbf{J}) = k_a \\gamma$. Since $k_a > 0$ and $\\gamma > 0$, their product $k_a \\gamma$ is strictly positive. Therefore, $\\det(\\mathbf{J})$ is always positive.\n\nSince both Routh-Hurwitz criteria ($\\text{Tr}(\\mathbf{J}) < 0$ and $\\det(\\mathbf{J}) > 0$) are satisfied for all parameter values within the physically-motivated constraints specified in the problem, the steady-state solution $(C_a^*, C_o^*)$ is always linearly stable. The conditions for stability are thus the same as the given constraints on the parameters: $k_a > 0$, $k_o > 0$, $\\alpha \\ge 0$, and $\\gamma > 0$.\nThe problem requests the closed-form expression for $C_a^*$ as the final answer.",

The final output aggregates all four scenarios in order as a single list: $[[[x_1,x_2,x_3],[s_1,s_2,s_3]],[[\\cdot,\\cdot,\\cdot],[\\cdot,\\cdot,\\cdot]],[[\\cdot,\\cdot,\\cdot],[\\cdot,\\cdot,\\cdot]],[[\\cdot,\\cdot,\\cdot],[\\cdot,\\cdot,\\cdot]]]$.\n\nTest suite and answer specification:\n- The program must compute results for the four scenarios above.\n- The output must be a single line containing the aggregated list described above.\n- Each number in the output must be a float rounded to six decimal places.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation and implementation of a Bayesian linear inversion to estimate carbon dioxide removal fluxes from synthetic atmospheric observations.\n\n### 1. Theoretical Derivation\n\nThe problem is to find the posterior probability distribution of the state vector $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ given the observation vector $\\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^m$, denoted as $p(\\mathbf{x}|\\mathbf{y})$. Bayes' theorem states:\n$$\np(\\mathbf{x}|\\mathbf{y}) = \\frac{p(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{x}) p(\\mathbf{x})}{p(\\mathbf{y})} \\propto p(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{x}) p(\\mathbf{x})\n$$\nwhere $p(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{x})$ is the likelihood, $p(\\mathbf{x})$ is the prior, and $p(\\mathbf{y})$ is a normalization constant (the evidence).\n\nThe problem defines a linear-Gaussian model. The prior distribution for the flux vector $\\mathbf{x}$ is a multivariate Gaussian:\n$$\np(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{x}_b, \\mathbf{B}) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{x}_b)^\\top \\mathbf{B}^{-1} (\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{x}_b)\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{x}_b$ is the prior mean and $\\mathbf{B}$ is the prior covariance matrix.\n\nThe forward model relating the state $\\mathbf{x}$ to the observations $\\mathbf{y}$ is linear:\n$$\n\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{e}\n$$\nThe observational error $\\mathbf{e}$ is assumed to be a zero-mean Gaussian random variable, $\\mathbf{e} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{0}, \\mathbf{R})$, where $\\mathbf{R}$ is the observational error covariance matrix. This implies that the likelihood of observing $\\mathbf{y}$ given a state $\\mathbf{x}$ is also a multivariate Gaussian:\n$$\np(\\mathbf{y}|\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{R}) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{x})^\\top \\mathbf{R}^{-1} (\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{x})\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the likelihood and prior into Bayes' theorem, the posterior distribution is:\n$$\np(\\mathbf{x}|\\mathbf{y}) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\left[ (\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{x}_b)^\\top \\mathbf{B}^{-1} (\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{x}_b) + (\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{x})^\\top \\mathbf{R}^{-1} (\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{x}) \\right]\\right)\n$$\nThe expression in the exponent is a quadratic function of $\\mathbf{x}$, which means the posterior distribution is also a Gaussian, $p(\\mathbf{x}|\\mathbf{y}) = \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{x}_a, \\mathbf{A})$. The posterior mean, $\\mathbf{x}_a$, corresponds to the value of $\\mathbf{x}$ that maximizes the posterior probability, which is equivalent to minimizing the negative log-posterior, often called the cost function $J(\\mathbf{x})$:\n$$\nJ(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{x}_b)^\\top \\mathbf{B}^{-1} (\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{x}_b) + \\frac{1}{2}(\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{x})^\\top \\mathbf{R}^{-1} (\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{x})\n$$\nTo find the minimum, we set the gradient of $J(\\mathbf{x})$ with respect to $\\mathbf{x}$ to zero:\n$$\n\\nabla_{\\mathbf{x}} J(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{B}^{-1}(\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{x}_b) - \\mathbf{H}^\\top \\mathbf{R}^{-1}(\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\nRearranging the terms to solve for $\\mathbf{x}$ yields the posterior mean $\\mathbf{x}_a$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{B}^{-1}\\mathbf{x}_a - \\mathbf{B}^{-1}\\mathbf{x}_b + \\mathbf{H}^\\top \\mathbf{R}^{-1}\\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{x}_a - \\mathbf{H}^\\top \\mathbf{R}^{-1}\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{0}\n$$\n$$\n(\\mathbf{B}^{-1} + \\mathbf{H}^\\top \\mathbf{R}^{-1}\\mathbf{H})\\mathbf{x}_a = \\mathbf{B}^{-1}\\mathbf{x}_b + \\mathbf{H}^\\top \\mathbf{R}^{-1}\\mathbf{y}\n$$\nThe term $(\\mathbf{B}^{-1} + \\mathbf{H}^\\top \\mathbf{R}^{-1}\\mathbf{H})$ is the inverse of the posterior covariance matrix, known as the Hessian of the cost function. Thus, the posterior covariance $\\mathbf{A}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{A} = (\\mathbf{B}^{-1} + \\mathbf{H}^\\top \\mathbf{R}^{-1}\\mathbf{H})^{-1}\n$$\nAnd the posterior mean is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}_a = \\mathbf{A}(\\mathbf{B}^{-1}\\mathbf{x}_b + \\mathbf{H}^\\top \\mathbf{R}^{-1}\\mathbf{y})\n$$\nThese expressions require explicit matrix inversions ($\\mathbf{B}^{-1}$, $\\mathbf{R}^{-1}$, and the Hessian), which can be numerically unstable.\n\n### 2. Numerically Stable Algorithm Design\n\nTo avoid explicit inversions, we can reformulate these expressions. Using the Woodbury matrix identity, the posterior covariance $\\mathbf{A}$ can be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{B} - \\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{H}^\\top (\\mathbf{R} + \\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{H}^\\top)^{-1} \\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{B}\n$$\nThis form still involves an inversion, but of a smaller matrix $(\\mathbf{R} + \\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{H}^\\top)$ of size $m \\times m$ instead of the Hessian of size $n \\times n$. This is particularly advantageous when $m \\ll n$. More importantly, this leads to the Kalman gain formulation.\n\nLet's define the gain matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K} = \\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{H}^\\top (\\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{H}^\\top + \\mathbf{R})^{-1}\n$$\nThe posterior mean $\\mathbf{x}_a$ can then be expressed as an update to the prior mean:\n$$\n\\mathbf{x}_a = \\mathbf{x}_b + \\mathbf{K}(\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{x}_b)\n$$\nAnd the posterior covariance $\\mathbf{A}$ can be simplified to:\n$$\n\\mathbf{A} = (\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{H})\\mathbf{B}\n$$\nwhere $\\mathbf{I}$ is the $n \\times n$ identity matrix. This formulation is standard in data assimilation and filtering theory.\n\nThe computation of the gain matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ involves the term $(\\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{H}^\\top + \\mathbf{R})^{-1}$. Let's define the innovation covariance matrix $\\mathbf{S} = \\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{H}^\\top + \\mathbf{R}$. The gain matrix becomes $\\mathbf{K} = \\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{H}^\\top\\mathbf{S}^{-1}$. Instead of inverting $\\mathbf{S}$, we can solve a linear system of equations. To find $\\mathbf{K}$, we solve:\n$$\n\\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{S} = \\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{H}^\\top \\implies \\mathbf{S}^\\top \\mathbf{K}^\\top = (\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{H}^\\top)^\\top\n$$\nSince $\\mathbf{B}$ and $\\mathbf{R}$ are symmetric positive definite (SPD), $\\mathbf{S}$ is also SPD, so $\\mathbf{S}^\\top = \\mathbf{S}$. The system to solve for $\\mathbf{K}^\\top$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{S} \\mathbf{K}^\\top = \\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{B}\n$$\nThis is a standard linear matrix equation of the form $\\mathbf{A}_{\\text{sys}}\\mathbf{X}_{\\text{sys}}=\\mathbf{B}_{\\text{sys}}$, where $\\mathbf{A}_{\\text{sys}}=\\mathbf{S}$, $\\mathbf{X}_{\\text{sys}}=\\mathbf{K}^\\top$, and $\\mathbf{B}_{\\text{sys}}=\\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{B}$. Since $\\mathbf{S}$ is SPD, this system can be efficiently and stably solved using Cholesky factorization.\n\nThe resulting algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1.  Given the inputs for a scenario ($\\mathbf{x}_b, \\mathbf{B}, \\mathbf{H}, \\mathbf{y}, \\mathbf{R}$).\n2.  Compute the innovation covariance matrix: $\\mathbf{S} = \\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{H}^\\top + \\mathbf{R}$.\n3.  Perform the Cholesky decomposition of $\\mathbf{S} = \\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{C}^\\top$, where $\\mathbf{C}$ is a lower-triangular matrix.\n4.  Solve the system $\\mathbf{S}\\mathbf{K}^\\top = \\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{B}$ for $\\mathbf{K}^\\top$ using the Cholesky factor $\\mathbf{C}$ (e.g., via `cho_solve`), which involves forward and backward substitution. Then find $\\mathbf{K}$.\n5.  Calculate the posterior mean: $\\mathbf{x}_a = \\mathbf{x}_b + \\mathbf{K}(\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{x}_b)$.\n6.  Calculate the posterior covariance: $\\mathbf{A} = (\\mathbf{I} - \\mathbf{K}\\mathbf{H})\\mathbf{B}$.\n7.  Extract the marginal posterior standard deviations: $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}_a = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{diag}(\\mathbf{A})}$. Care is taken to handle potential small negative diagonal entries arising from floating-point errors by taking the maximum of the diagonal and zero before the square root.\n\nThis algorithm computes the required quantities without any explicit matrix inversions, fulfilling the problem's requirements.",
