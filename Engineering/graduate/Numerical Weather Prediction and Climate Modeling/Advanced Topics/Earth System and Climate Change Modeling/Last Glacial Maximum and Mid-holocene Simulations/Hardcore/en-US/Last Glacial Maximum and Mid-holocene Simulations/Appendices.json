            "solution": "The user wants me to solve a thermodynamics problem. I will now begin the validation and solving process.\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective. All necessary information is provided, and the task is a standard application of calculus to climate physics.\n\nThe problem requires the calculation of the change in outgoing longwave radiation, $\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{OLR}}$, at the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) corresponding to the temperature change from the preindustrial era to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). This calculation is to be performed using a first-order Taylor expansion of the Stefan-Boltzmann law.\n\nAccording to the problem statement, the outgoing longwave radiation, $R$, is governed by the Stefan-Boltzmann law for a blackbody:\n$$R(T_e) = \\sigma T_e^4$$\nwhere $\\sigma$ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and $T_e$ is the effective emission temperature of the Earth.\n\nWe are asked to linearize this relationship around a preindustrial reference state characterized by the effective emission temperature $T_{e0}$. A first-order Taylor expansion of the function $R(T_e)$ around the point $T_{e0}$ is given by:\n$$R(T_e) \\approx R(T_{e0}) + \\frac{dR}{dT_e}\\bigg|_{T_{e0}} (T_e - T_{e0})$$\nThe change in outgoing longwave radiation, $\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{OLR}}$, is the difference between the radiation at the perturbed temperature $T_e$ and the radiation at the reference temperature $T_{e0}$:\n$$\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{OLR}} = R(T_e) - R(T_{e0})$$\nSubstituting the Taylor expansion, we find that to a first-order approximation, this change is:\n$$\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{OLR}} \\approx \\frac{dR}{dT_e}\\bigg|_{T_{e0}} (T_e - T_{e0})$$\nLet $\\Delta T_e = T_e - T_{e0}$ be the perturbation in the effective emission temperature. Then the expression becomes:\n$$\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{OLR}} \\approx \\frac{dR}{dT_e}\\bigg|_{T_{e0}} \\Delta T_e$$\nThe term $\\frac{dR}{dT_e}\\big|_{T_{e0}}$ represents the sensitivity of the outgoing longwave radiation to a change in emission temperature, evaluated at the reference state. This is the Planck feedback parameter. To find it, we first compute the derivative of $R(T_e)$ with respect to $T_e$:\n$$\\frac{dR}{dT_e} = \\frac{d}{dT_e}(\\sigma T_e^4) = 4\\sigma T_e^3$$\nEvaluating this derivative at the reference temperature $T_{e0}$ gives the Planck feedback parameter, which we can denote as $\\lambda_P$. In this simplified model, where it is assumed that $\\Delta T_e = \\Delta T_s$, this parameter also represents the change in OLR per unit change in surface temperature.\n$$\\lambda_P = \\frac{dR}{dT_e}\\bigg|_{T_{e0}} = 4\\sigma T_{e0}^3$$\nNow, we can substitute the given values to compute $\\lambda_P$.

It quantifies how much the outgoing longwave radiation increases for each Kelvin of temperature increase, providing a stabilizing (negative) feedback on the climate system.\n\nNext, we compute the change in outgoing longwave radiation, $\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{OLR}}$. The formula is:\n$$\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{OLR}} \\approx \\lambda_P \\Delta T_e$$\nThe problem states that the perturbation of the effective emission temperature equals the surface temperature perturbation, $\\Delta T_e = \\Delta T_s$. The given LGM surface temperature anomaly is $\\Delta T_s = -4.5\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\nTherefore, $\\Delta T_e = -4.5\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nSubstituting the values for $\\lambda_P$ and $\\Delta T_e$:\n$$\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{OLR}} \\approx (3.7610486\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (-4.5\\,\\mathrm{K})$$\n$$\\Delta R_{\\mathrm{OLR}} \\approx -16.9247187\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the outgoing longwave radiation was lower during the colder LGM, which is physically consistent.\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be expressed in $\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$ and rounded to four significant figures.

            "problem": "A mountain glacier is approximated by a one-dimensional vertical column in a climate model. The equilibrium line altitude (ELA) is defined by the altitude $z$ at which the annual net mass balance $b(z)$ is zero, i.e., the annual accumulation equals the annual ablation.
