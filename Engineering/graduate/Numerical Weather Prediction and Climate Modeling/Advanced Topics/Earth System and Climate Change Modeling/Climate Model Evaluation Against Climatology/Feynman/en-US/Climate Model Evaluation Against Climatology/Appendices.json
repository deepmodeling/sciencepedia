In this case, $n_{\\text{eff}}  N$, meaning the true uncertainty in the sample mean is larger than suggested by the nominal sample size $N$. Ignoring this effect (i.e., using $N$ instead of $n_{\\text{eff}}$) leads to an underestimation of the standard error, resulting in a confidence interval that is deceptively narrow. This implies false precision and increases the rate of Type I errors (e.g., incorrectly concluding a model has a significant bias when it does not).\n\n3) Calculation of the confidence interval half-width\n\nGiven:\n- Sample size: $N=480$\n- Estimated lag-$1$ autocorrelation: $\\rho(1)=0.50$\n- Sample residual variance: $s^{2} = 2.25 \\, \\text{K}^2$\n- Nominal coverage: $0.95$, which corresponds to a critical value $z_{0.025} = 1.96$.\n\nFirst, we compute the effective sample size $n_{\\text{eff}}$:\n$$ n_{\\text{eff}} = N \\left( \\frac{1-\\rho(1)}{1+\\rho(1)} \\right) = 480 \\left( \\frac{1-0.50}{1+0.50} \\right) = 480 \\left( \\frac{0.50}{1.50} \\right) = 480 \\times \\frac{1}{3} = 160 $$\nNext, we calculate the estimated standard error of the mean, $\\text{SE}(\\bar{X}_N)$, using $n_{\\text{eff}}$ and the sample variance $s^2$:\n$$ \\text{SE}(\\bar{X}_N) \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{s^2}{n_{\\text{eff}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2.25}{160}} \\, \\text{K} $$\nThe half-width (HW) of the confidence interval is:\n$$ \\text{HW} = z_{0.025} \\times \\text{SE}(\\bar{X}_N) = 1.96 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{2.25}{160}} \\, \\text{K} $$\nNow, we compute the numerical value:\n$$ \\text{HW} = 1.96 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{2.25}}{\\sqrt{160}} = 1.96 \\times \\frac{1.5}{\\sqrt{160}} \\approx 1.96 \\times \\frac{1.5}{12.6491} \\approx 0.232427 \\, \\text{K} $$\nRounding to three significant figures gives:\n$$ \\text{HW} \\approx 0.232 \\, \\text{K} $$",
