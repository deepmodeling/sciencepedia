It is a standard, well-posed problem in physical glaciology. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe first step is to derive the prognostic equation for ice thickness $H$. This is achieved by applying the principle of mass conservation. For an incompressible material of constant density, the continuity equation states that the divergence of the velocity field $\\mathbf{v} = (u, v, w)$ is zero:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} = 0 $$\nHere, $u$ and $v$ are the horizontal velocity components and $w$ is the vertical velocity component in a Cartesian coordinate system where $z$ is the vertical direction.\n\nWe integrate this equation over the depth of the ice column, from the base elevation $z=b(x,y,t)$ to the surface elevation $z=s(x,y,t)$:\n$$ \\int_{b}^{s} \\left( \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial y} \\right) dz + \\int_{b}^{s} \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} dz = 0 $$\nThe second integral is exact:\n$$ \\int_{b}^{s} \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial z} dz = w(s) - w(b) $$\nwhere $w(s)$ and $w(b)$ are the vertical velocities of ice at the surface and base, respectively.\n\nFor the first integral, we use the Leibniz integral rule. Let $\\mathbf{u}_h = (u,v)$ be the horizontal velocity vector and $\\nabla_h = (\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y})$ be the horizontal gradient operator. The vertically integrated horizontal flux is defined as $\\mathbf{q} = \\int_{b}^{s} \\mathbf{u}_h dz$. The divergence of this flux is $\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{q}$. Applying the Leibniz rule:\n$$ \\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{q} = \\nabla_h \\cdot \\int_{b}^{s} \\mathbf{u}_h dz = \\int_{b}^{s} (\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{u}_h) dz + \\mathbf{u}_h(s) \\cdot \\nabla_h s - \\mathbf{u}_h(b) \\cdot \\nabla_h b $$\nRearranging gives the term we need:\n$$ \\int_{b}^{s} (\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{u}_h) dz = \\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{q} - \\mathbf{u}_h(s) \\cdot \\nabla_h s + \\mathbf{u}_h(b) \\cdot \\nabla_h b $$\nSubstituting this back into the integrated continuity equation, and using the problem's notation $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q}$ for the horizontal divergence $\\nabla_h \\cdot \\mathbf{q}$:\n$$ (\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} - \\mathbf{u}_h(s) \\cdot \\nabla_h s + \\mathbf{u}_h(b) \\cdot \\nabla_h b) + (w(s) - w(b)) = 0 $$\nNext, we apply the kinematic boundary conditions at the surface and base. A material point on a boundary surface must move with that surface, adjusted for any mass flux across it.\nThe condition at the surface $z=s$ is:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{u}_h(s) \\cdot \\nabla_h s = w(s) + a_s $$\nwhere $a_s$ is the surface mass balance rate (accumulation). Rearranging gives:\n$$ w(s) - \\mathbf{u}_h(s) \\cdot \\nabla_h s = \\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial t} - a_s $$\nThe condition at the base $z=b$ is analogous, but with the basal mass balance rate $a_b$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial t} + \\mathbf{u}_h(b) \\cdot \\nabla_h b = w(b) + a_b $$\nThe problem states that basal mass balance is negligible, so $a_b=0$. Rearranging gives:\n$$ w(b) - \\mathbf{u}_h(b) \\cdot \\nabla_h b = \\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial t} $$\nNow we substitute these expressions for the boundary terms back into the integrated continuity equation:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} - \\left( \\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial t} - a_s \\right) + \\left( \\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial t} \\right) = 0 $$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} - \\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial t} + a_s + \\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial t} = 0 $$\nRecognizing that the ice thickness is $H = s - b$, its time derivative is $\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial t} - \\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial t}$. We can rewrite the equation as:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} - \\left( \\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial t} - \\frac{\\partial b}{\\partial t} \\right) + a_s = 0 $$\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} - \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial t} + a_s = 0 $$\nSolving for the time rate of change of ice thickness, we obtain the prognostic equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial t} = a_s - \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q} $$\nThis equation states that the local rate of thickening is the net result of mass gain from the atmosphere ($a_s$) and mass loss from horizontal ice export ($\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q}$).\n\nWith the prognostic equation derived, we compute the total change in thickness $\\Delta H$ over a time interval $\\Delta t$. Since $a_s$ and $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q}$ are given as constant tendencies, we can integrate the equation directly:\n$$ \\Delta H = \\int_{0}^{\\Delta t} \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial t} dt = \\int_{0}^{\\Delta t} (a_s - \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q}) dt $$\n$$ \\Delta H = (a_s - \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q}) \\Delta t $$\nNow, we substitute the provided numerical values: $a_s = 0.5\\ \\mathrm{m\\ yr^{-1}}$, $\\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{q} = 0.3\\ \\mathrm{m\\ yr^{-1}}$, and $\\Delta t = 1\\ \\mathrm{yr}$.\n$$ \\Delta H = (0.5\\ \\mathrm{m\\ yr^{-1}} - 0.3\\ \\mathrm{m\\ yr^{-1}}) \\times 1\\ \\mathrm{yr} $$\n$$ \\Delta H = 0.2\\ \\mathrm{m\\ yr^{-1}} \\times 1\\ \\mathrm{yr} $$\n$$ \\Delta H = 0.2\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ \\Delta H = 0.200\\ \\mathrm{m} $$\nFinally, we must assess the local mass budget residual, defined as $R \\equiv \\Delta H - (a_s - \\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{q})\\Delta t$. From our derivation, we established that for constant tendencies, $\\Delta H$ is precisely equal to $(a_s - \\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{q})\\Delta t$. Therefore, substituting this into the definition of the residual:\n$$ R = [(a_s - \\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{q})\\Delta t] - [(a_s - \\nabla\\cdot\\mathbf{q})\\Delta t] = 0 $$\nThe residual is exactly zero, confirming that the mass budget closes perfectly under the assumptions made. The change in thickness is, by definition, the integrated net mass balance.",

Subsequently, numerical calculations are required for the basal speed under two different traction conditions and their ratio.\n\nFirst, we establish the explicit functional form of the power-law friction closure. The problem states that the basal traction magnitude $\\tau_b$ is related to the basal slip speed $u_b$ via a power law involving a coefficient $C$ and an exponent $m$. The units of these quantities are provided as $[\\tau_b] = \\mathrm{Pa}$, $[u_b] = \\mathrm{m}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, and $[C] = \\mathrm{Pa}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}^m\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^{-m}$.

Substituting $p=1$, we get $-m(1)+q=0$, which also implies $q=m$.\nAssuming the simplest case where the dimensionless constant $k=1$, the unique relationship consistent with the provided units is:\n$$ \\tau_b = C u_b^m $$\nThis is the specific form of the generalized power-law friction closure. It describes a shear-thickening rheology since the exponent $m > 1$, meaning the resistance to sliding increases more than linearly with speed.

This criterion imposes an upper limit on the magnitude of the basal traction that the subglacial till can sustain before failing. This limit, or yield stress, is denoted by $\\tau_c$ and is given by $\\tau_c = \\mu N$, where $\\mu$ is the friction coefficient and $N$ is the effective pressure at the bed. The admissible basal traction $\\tau_b$ must therefore satisfy the condition $\\tau_b \\le \\tau_c$. The full basal sliding law is a composite rule: the power-law relates speed to traction, but only for traction values up to the Coulomb limit. If the gravitational driving stress (which must be balanced by $\\tau_b$ in equilibrium) exceeds $\\tau_c$, the bed material fails, and the traction is capped at $\\tau_c$. The actual basal traction is therefore $\\tau_b = \\min(\\tau_{\\text{driving}}, \\tau_c)$, and the corresponding speed is found using the derived power-law expression with this value of $\\tau_b$.\n\nWe now proceed with the numerical calculations using the provided parameters, converted to base SI units:\n- Basal traction: $\\tau_b = 100\\ \\mathrm{kPa} = 1 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$.\n- Material coefficient: $C = 10^7\\ \\mathrm{Pa\\ s^{m}\\ m^{-m}}$.\n- Exponent: $m = 3$.\n- Friction coefficient: $\\mu = 0.5$.\n- Effective pressure: $N = 1\\ \\mathrm{MPa} = 1 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the Coulomb traction limit, $\\tau_c$:\n$$ \\tau_c = \\mu N = (0.5) \\cdot (1 \\times 10^6\\ \\mathrm{Pa}) = 5 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{Pa} $$\nSince the given admissible traction $\\tau_b = 1 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$ is less than $\\tau_c = 5 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$, the system is operating in the stable power-law sliding regime.\n\n$1.$ The basal slip speed predicted by the power-law closure for $\\tau_b = 100\\ \\mathrm{kPa}$:\n$$ u_b(\\tau_b) = \\left(\\frac{1 \\times 10^5\\ \\mathrm{Pa}}{10^7\\ \\mathrm{Pa\\ s^3\\ m^{-3}}}\\right)^{1/3} = \\left(10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m^3\\ s^{-3}}\\right)^{1/3} = 10^{-2/3}\\ \\mathrm{m\\ s^{-1}} $$\nNumerically, this speed is $u_b(\\tau_b) \\approx 0.21544\\ \\mathrm{m\\ s^{-1}}$.

A solution will be derived.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe problem requires finding the largest coupling interval, $\\Delta t_{c}$, that satisfies two distinct constraints. We will analyze each constraint separately and then combine them to find the final answer.\n\n**Constraint (i): Avoidance of Aliasing**\n\nThis constraint relates to the sampling of the atmospheric signal, which has a dominant diurnal cycle. The Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem provides the fundamental condition to prevent aliasing. The theorem states that the sampling frequency, $f_{s}$, must be strictly greater than twice the maximum frequency present in the signal, $f_{\\text{max}}$.\n\nThe signal of interest is the diurnal cycle with a period of $T_{d} = 24$ h. The corresponding frequency is $f_{d} = \\frac{1}{T_{d}}$. We set $f_{\\text{max}} = f_{d}$.\n\nThe sampling is performed at the coupling interval $\\Delta t_{c}$, so the sampling frequency is $f_{s} = \\frac{1}{\\Delta t_{c}}$.\n\nAccording to the Nyquist-Shannon theorem, we must have:\n$$f_{s} > 2 f_{\\text{max}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $f_{s}$ and $f_{\\text{max}}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\Delta t_{c}} > \\frac{2}{T_{d}}$$\nSolving for $\\Delta t_{c}$ yields the first constraint:\n$$\\Delta t_{c} < \\frac{T_{d}}{2}$$\nGiven $T_{d} = 24$ h, this constraint becomes:\n$$\\Delta t_{c} < \\frac{24 \\text{ h}}{2} = 12 \\text{ h}$$\n\n**Constraint (ii): ZOH-Induced Relative Amplitude Error**\n\nThis constraint concerns the accuracy of signal reconstruction. A zero-order hold (ZOH) process, which holds a sampled value constant for the duration of the interval $\\Delta t_{c}$, can be modeled as a linear time-invariant system. When a sampled signal is reconstructed using a ZOH, the amplitude of its frequency components is modified. The frequency-dependent gain, $G(\\omega)$, of this sample-and-hold process is given by the normalized sinc function:\n$$G(\\omega) = \\frac{\\sin(\\omega \\Delta t_{c} / 2)}{\\omega \\Delta t_{c} / 2}$$\nwhere $\\omega$ is the angular frequency. This gain represents the ratio of the output amplitude to the input amplitude for a sinusoidal component at frequency $\\omega$. An ideal reconstruction would have a gain of $1$.\n\nThe relative amplitude error is the magnitude of the deviation from this ideal gain of $1$:\n$$\\text{Error} = |1 - G(\\omega)|$$\nThe problem states this error must not exceed $0.05$ for the diurnal frequency. The diurnal angular frequency is $\\omega_{d} = \\frac{2\\pi}{T_{d}}$. The constraint is therefore:\n$$|1 - G(\\omega_{d})| \\le 0.05$$\nThe first constraint, $\\Delta t_{c} < T_{d}/2$, implies that the argument of the sinc function, $x = \\omega_{d} \\Delta t_{c} / 2 = \\frac{2\\pi}{T_{d}} \\frac{\\Delta t_{c}}{2} = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta t_{c}}{T_{d}}$, is in the range $0 < x < \\pi/2$. In this range, $G(\\omega_{d}) = \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x}$ is a positive value less than $1$. Thus, the absolute value can be removed, and the constraint simplifies to:\n$$1 - G(\\omega_{d}) \\le 0.05$$\n$$G(\\omega_{d}) \\ge 0.95$$\nSubstituting the expression for the gain, we have:\n$$\\frac{\\sin(\\omega_{d} \\Delta t_{c} / 2)}{\\omega_{d} \\Delta t_{c} / 2} \\ge 0.95$$\nLet the dimensionless variable be $x = \\frac{\\omega_{d} \\Delta t_{c}}{2} = \\frac{\\pi \\Delta t_{c}}{T_{d}}$. The inequality becomes:\n$$\\frac{\\sin(x)}{x} \\ge 0.95$$\nThe function $\\frac{\\sin(x)}{x}$ is monotonically decreasing for $x \\in (0, \\pi)$. To find the upper limit on $x$, we must solve the equation $\\frac{\\sin(x_{0})}{x_{0}} = 0.95$. This is a transcendental equation that requires a numerical solution. The solution for $x_{0} > 0$ is found to be:\n$$x_{0} \\approx 0.54906 \\text{ radians}$$\nThe inequality is satisfied for $0 < x \\le x_{0}$. We thus have the condition:\n$$\\frac{\\pi \\Delta t_{c}}{T_{d}} \\le x_{0}$$\nSolving for $\\Delta t_{c}$ gives the second constraint:\n$$\\Delta t_{c} \\le \\frac{x_{0} T_{d}}{\\pi}$$\n\n**Determination of the Final Coupling Interval**\n\nWe now have two constraints on $\\Delta t_{c}$:\n1. $\\Delta t_{c} < 12$ h\n2. $\\Delta t_{c} \\le \\frac{x_{0} T_{d}}{\\pi}$\n\nTo find the largest possible $\\Delta t_{c}$, we must satisfy both conditions. This means $\\Delta t_{c}$ must be less than or equal to the minimum of the two upper bounds. Let's calculate the numerical value of the second bound:\n$$\\Delta t_{c} \\le \\frac{(0.54906)(24 \\text{ h})}{\\pi} \\approx \\frac{13.17744 \\text{ h}}{\\pi} \\approx 4.1945 \\text{ h}$$\nComparing the two bounds:\n- Bound 1: $12$ h\n- Bound 2: $4.1945$ h\n\nThe second constraint is clearly more restrictive. Therefore, the largest possible coupling interval $\\Delta t_{c}$ is determined by the ZOH-induced error condition.\n$$\\Delta t_{c, \\text{max}} \\approx 4.1945 \\text{ h}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\\Delta t_{c, \\text{max}} \\approx 4.19 \\text{ h}$$\nThis is the largest coupling interval that avoids aliasing while keeping the ZOH-induced amplitude distortion of the diurnal cycle within the specified tolerance.",
