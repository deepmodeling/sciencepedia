The Kaya identity is a powerful framework that decomposes emissions into four key socioeconomic factors: population, affluence, energy intensity, and carbon intensity. This practice  will allow you to apply this identity to quantify how the contrasting narratives of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways—specifically the sustainable path of SSP1 and the rivalrous path of SSP3—produce dramatically different cumulative emissions, providing a concrete link between societal choices and their climate consequences.",

            "problem": "In climate scenario analysis for Earth system modeling, the Kaya decomposition defines carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) emissions as the product of four drivers: population $P$, affluence measured as gross domestic product (GDP) per capita $A$, energy intensity of GDP $I$, and carbon intensity of energy $C$. Specifically, the Kaya identity states that yearly emissions $E$ satisfy $E = P \\times A \\times I \\times C$. Consider two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs): Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 1 (SSP1, sustainability) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 3 (SSP3, regional rivalry). Assume continuous-time dynamics in which each driver evolves with a constant proportional rate over a horizon of $T = 30$ years starting at $t = 0$. That is, for each driver $X \\in \\{P, A, I, C\\}$ and for each scenario $s \\in \\{\\text{SSP1}, \\text{SSP3}\\}$, $X_{s}(t) = X_{0} \\exp(r_{X,s} t)$, with all factors independent.\n\nBoth scenarios share the same baseline year-$0$ state consistent with observed conditions: $E(0) = P_{0} A_{0} I_{0} C_{0}$, representing a global baseline of $36$ gigatonnes $CO_2$ per year. The only differences between scenarios are the population growth and decarbonization rates (the latter represented by declines in energy intensity and carbon intensity). In both scenarios, affluence (GDP per capita) grows at the same rate.\n\nThe scenario-specific rates are:\n- Population growth: $r_{P,\\text{SSP1}} = 0.003$ per year and $r_{P,\\text{SSP3}} = 0.010$ per year.\n- Affluence growth (GDP per capita): $r_{A,\\text{SSP1}} = r_{A,\\text{SSP3}} = 0.018$ per year.\n- Energy intensity change: $r_{I,\\text{SSP1}} = -0.020$ per year and $r_{I,\\text{SSP3}} = -0.008$ per year.\n- Carbon intensity change: $r_{C,\\text{SSP1}} = -0.030$ per year and $r_{C,\\text{SSP3}} = -0.005$ per year.\n\nUsing only the Kaya identity and the assumption of continuous compounding for the four drivers, derive the expression for the cumulative emissions $S_{s}$ over the interval $t \\in [0, T]$ for each scenario $s$, and compute the ratio \n$$R \\equiv \\frac{S_{\\text{SSP3}}}{S_{\\text{SSP1}}}.$$\nExpress your final answer as a dimensionless ratio rounded to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the calculation of the ratio of cumulative carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) emissions between two socioeconomic scenarios, SSP3 and SSP1, over a specified time horizon, based on the Kaya identity and an exponential growth model for its drivers.\n\nFirst, we establish the mathematical framework. The Kaya identity gives the instantaneous yearly emissions, $E(t)$, as the product of four drivers: population ($P$), affluence ($A$), energy intensity ($I$), and carbon intensity ($C$).\n$$E(t) = P(t) A(t) I(t) C(t)$$\nFor each scenario $s \\in \\{\\text{SSP1}, \\text{SSP3}\\}$, each driver $X \\in \\{P, A, I, C\\}$ is modeled to evolve over time $t$ according to the equation:\n$$X_s(t) = X_0 \\exp(r_{X,s} t)$$\nwhere $X_0$ is the value of the driver at the initial time $t=0$ and $r_{X,s}$ is the constant proportional rate of change for that driver in scenario $s$.\n\nWe can express the emissions for a given scenario $s$, $E_s(t)$, by substituting the individual driver dynamics into the Kaya identity:\n$$E_s(t) = P_s(t) A_s(t) I_s(t) C_s(t)$$\n$$E_s(t) = \\left(P_0 \\exp(r_{P,s} t)\\right) \\left(A_0 \\exp(r_{A,s} t)\\right) \\left(I_0 \\exp(r_{I,s} t)\\right) \\left(C_0 \\exp(r_{C,s} t)\\right)$$\nBy grouping the initial value terms and combining the exponents, we get:\n$$E_s(t) = (P_0 A_0 I_0 C_0) \\exp\\left( (r_{P,s} + r_{A,s} + r_{I,s} + r_{C,s}) t \\right)$$\nThe term $(P_0 A_0 I_0 C_0)$ is simply the initial emissions at $t=0$, which is given as $E(0)$. We can define an aggregate emissions growth rate for each scenario, $r_{E,s}$, as the sum of the individual driver growth rates:\n$$r_{E,s} = r_{P,s} + r_{A,s} + r_{I,s} + r_{C,s}$$\nThus, the emissions function for each scenario simplifies to:\n$$E_s(t) = E(0) \\exp(r_{E,s} t)$$\n\nNext, we calculate the aggregate emissions growth rates for SSP1 and SSP3 using the provided data.\nFor SSP1:\n$$r_{E,\\text{SSP1}} = r_{P,\\text{SSP1}} + r_{A,\\text{SSP1}} + r_{I,\\text{SSP1}} + r_{C,\\text{SSP1}}$$\n$$r_{E,\\text{SSP1}} = 0.003 + 0.018 + (-0.020) + (-0.030) = 0.021 - 0.050 = -0.029 \\text{ per year}$$\nFor SSP3:\n$$r_{E,\\text{SSP3}} = r_{P,\\text{SSP3}} + r_{A,\\text{SSP3}} + r_{I,\\text{SSP3}} + r_{C,\\text{SSP3}}$$\n$$r_{E,\\text{SSP3}} = 0.010 + 0.018 + (-0.008) + (-0.005) = 0.028 - 0.013 = 0.015 \\text{ per year}$$\n\nThe cumulative emissions, $S_s$, over the time horizon from $t=0$ to $t=T$ is the definite integral of the emissions rate $E_s(t)$ over this interval. The time horizon is given as $T=30$ years.\n$$S_s = \\int_{0}^{T} E_s(t) \\,dt = \\int_{0}^{T} E(0) \\exp(r_{E,s} t) \\,dt$$\nSince $E(0)$ is a constant, we can take it out of the integral:\n$$S_s = E(0) \\int_{0}^{T} \\exp(r_{E,s} t) \\,dt$$\nThe integral of the exponential function is:\n$$S_s = E(0) \\left[ \\frac{\\exp(r_{E,s} t)}{r_{E,s}} \\right]_{0}^{T}$$\nEvaluating the expression at the limits of integration (and noting that $r_{E,s} \\neq 0$ for both scenarios):\n$$S_s = E(0) \\left( \\frac{\\exp(r_{E,s} T) - \\exp(r_{E,s} \\cdot 0)}{r_{E,s}} \\right)$$\n$$S_s = E(0) \\frac{\\exp(r_{E,s} T) - 1}{r_{E,s}}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio $R \\equiv \\frac{S_{\\text{SSP3}}}{S_{\\text{SSP1}}}$.\n$$R = \\frac{E(0) \\frac{\\exp(r_{E,\\text{SSP3}} T) - 1}{r_{E,\\text{SSP3}}}}{E(0) \\frac{\\exp(r_{E,\\text{SSP1}} T) - 1}{r_{E,\\text{SSP1}}}}$$\nThe initial emission value $E(0)$ cancels out, so its value of $36$ gigatonnes $CO_2$ per year is not needed for the final ratio.\n$$R = \\frac{\\exp(r_{E,\\text{SSP3}} T) - 1}{r_{E,\\text{SSP3}}} \\cdot \\frac{r_{E,\\text{SSP1}}}{\\exp(r_{E,\\text{SSP1}} T) - 1}$$\nRearranging for clarity:\n$$R = \\left(\\frac{r_{E,\\text{SSP1}}}{r_{E,\\text{SSP3}}}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\exp(r_{E,\\text{SSP3}} T) - 1}{\\exp(r_{E,\\text{SSP1}} T) - 1}\\right)$$\n\nNow, we substitute the numerical values:\n$T = 30$\n$r_{E,\\text{SSP1}} = -0.029$\n$r_{E,\\text{SSP3}} = 0.015$\n\nFirst, compute the products in the exponents:\n$r_{E,\\text{SSP1}} T = -0.029 \\times 30 = -0.87$\n$r_{E,\\text{SSP3}} T = 0.015 \\times 30 = 0.45$\n\nSubstitute these values into the expression for $R$:\n$$R = \\left(\\frac{-0.029}{0.015}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\exp(0.45) - 1}{\\exp(-0.87) - 1}\\right)$$\nNow we compute the numerical values of the terms:\n$\\exp(0.45) \\approx 1.568312$\n$\\exp(-0.87) \\approx 0.418965$\n$\\exp(0.45) - 1 \\approx 0.568312$\n$\\exp(-0.87) - 1 \\approx -0.581035$\n\nThe ratio $R$ is therefore:\n$$R \\approx \\left(\\frac{-0.029}{0.015}\\right) \\left(\\frac{0.568312}{-0.581035}\\right)$$\nThe two negative signs cancel out, yielding a positive result as expected for a ratio of cumulative emissions.\n$$R \\approx (-1.93333...) \\times (-0.978103...)$$\n$$R \\approx 1.8910403$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives $1.891$.\nThis means that over the $30$-year period, the total $CO_2$ emissions in the SSP3 (regional rivalry) scenario are approximately $1.891$ times the emissions in the SSP1 (sustainability) scenario.",

Radiative forcing and surface temperature evolution in a climate model are constrained by conservation of energy: the net top-of-atmosphere energy imbalance must equal the rate of change of heat content in the climate system plus the radiative response. A minimal Energy Balance Model (EBM) that captures this constraint is given by the one-layer ordinary differential equation $C \\,\\frac{dT}{dt} = F(t) - \\lambda T$, where $T(t)$ is the global-mean surface air temperature anomaly, $F(t)$ is the externally imposed effective anthropogenic radiative forcing, $C$ is the effective heat capacity of the climate system, and $\\lambda$ is the linear climate feedback parameter.\n\nAssume the following physically plausible parameter values and initial condition consistent with anomalies defined relative to the year $2020$: $C = 20\\,\\mathrm{W\\,yr\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-1}}$, $\\lambda = 1.2\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-1}}$, and $T(0) = 0\\,\\mathrm{K}$, with $t$ measured in years from $2020$ so that $t = 80$ corresponds to the year $2100$.

Achieving the same $2100$ forcing necessarily implies the same $2100$ global-mean temperature, because $T(2100)$ depends only on $F(2100)$.\n\nB. Late-century negative emissions that reduce $F(t)$ to $8.5\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$ by $2100$ will yield a lower $T(2100)$ than the monotonic pathway, because the logarithmic relationship between carbon dioxide concentration and radiative forcing makes mid-century overshoot inconsequential.\n\nC. Despite identical $F(2100)$, the overshoot pathway yields higher $T(2100)$ and larger ocean heat content than the monotonic pathway, due to path dependence arising from finite heat capacity and slow equilibration; therefore late-century negative emissions can transform SSP5-$8.5$ into an overshoot with the same label but different transient warming.\n\nD. Matching $F(2100)$ guarantees identical cumulative energy uptake by $2100$, so ocean heat content and thermosteric sea level rise must be the same for monotonic and overshoot pathways.",

In terms of $t'$, $F_O(t'+40) = 10.5 - 0.025(t'+40) = 9.5 - 0.025t'$.\nSo, $a_{O2} = 9.5\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$ and $b_{O2} = -0.025\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,yr^{-1}}$.\nThe general solution for this stage is:\n$$T_O(t'+40) = \\left(\\frac{a_{O2}+b_{O2}t'}{\\lambda} - \\frac{b_{O2}C}{\\lambda^2}\\right) + K e^{-t'/\\tau}$$\nwhere $K$ is determined by the condition at $t'=0$ ($t=40$):\n$$T_O(40) = \\left(\\frac{a_{O2}}{\\lambda} - \\frac{b_{O2}C}{\\lambda^2}\\right) + K$$\nWe need to find $T_O(80)$, which corresponds to $t'=40$.\n- $t' = 40\\,\\mathrm{yr}$\n- $\\frac{t'}{\\tau} = 2.4$\n- Constants for the solution:\n  - $\\frac{b_{O2}C}{\\lambda^2} = \\frac{-0.025 \\times 20}{1.2^2} = \\frac{-0.5}{1.44} \\approx -0.347\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n  - At $t=80$ ($t'=40$), $F_O(80) = 8.5\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$.\n  - $\\frac{F_O(80)}{\\lambda} = \\frac{8.5}{1.2} \\approx 7.083\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- The particular solution at $t'=40$ is $T_p(40) = \\frac{F_O(80)}{\\lambda} - \\frac{b_{O2}C}{\\lambda^2} \\approx 7.083 - (-0.347) = 7.430\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n- The value of the particular solution at $t'=0$ is $T_p(0) = \\frac{a_{O2}}{\\lambda} - \\frac{b_{O2}C}{\\lambda^2} = \\frac{9.5}{1.2} - (-0.347) \\approx 7.917 + 0.347 = 8.264\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\nThe full solution at $t'=40$ is:\n$$T_O(80) = T_p(40) + \\left(T_O(40) - T_p(0)\\right)e^{-40/\\tau}$$\n$$T_O(80) \\approx 7.430 + (5.542 - 8.264)e^{-2.4} \\approx 7.430 + (-2.722)(0.0907)$$\n$$T_O(80) \\approx 7.430 - 0.247 = 7.183\\,\\mathrm{K}$$\n$$T_O(80) \\approx 7.18\\,\\mathrm{K}$$\n\n### Summary of Results\n- Warming under Pathway H: $T_H(80) \\approx 6.05\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- Warming under Pathway O: $T_O(80) \\approx 7.18\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n\nThe calculation clearly shows that $T_O(80) > T_H(80)$ despite $F_O(80) = F_H(80)$. This is because the temperature of the system at any given time depends on the entire history of the forcing, not just its instantaneous value. The overshoot pathway has a significantly higher cumulative forcing over the 80-year period, leading to a greater total energy input and accumulation of heat in the system.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Achieving the same $2100$ forcing necessarily implies the same $2100$ global-mean temperature, because $T(2100)$ depends only on $F(2100)$.**\nThis statement claims that temperature is a state function of the instantaneous forcing. This would only be true for a system with zero heat capacity ($C=0$) or one that is always in equilibrium ($\\frac{dT}{dt}=0$). The model explicitly includes a non-zero heat capacity, describing a transient system. Our calculation shows $T_H(80) \\approx 6.05\\,\\mathrm{K}$ and $T_O(80) \\approx 7.18\\,\\mathrm{K}$, which are clearly not the same.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Late-century negative emissions that reduce $F(t)$ to $8.5\\,\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}}$ by $2100$ will yield a lower $T(2100)$ than the monotonic pathway, because the logarithmic relationship between carbon dioxide concentration and radiative forcing makes mid-century overshoot inconsequential.**\nThis statement makes two incorrect claims. First, it asserts that the overshoot pathway results in a lower temperature ($T_O(80) < T_H(80)$). Our calculation proves the opposite ($T_O(80) > T_H(80)$). Second, the reasoning about the logarithmic relationship is irrelevant to the dynamics of the EBM, which is fully specified in terms of $F(t)$. Furthermore, the thermal inertia of the climate system makes the \"mid-century overshoot\" highly consequential, not inconsequential.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Despite identical $F(2100)$, the overshoot pathway yields higher $T(2100)$ and larger ocean heat content than the monotonic pathway, due to path dependence arising from finite heat capacity and slow equilibration; therefore late-century negative emissions can transform SSP5-$8.5$ into an overshoot with the same label but different transient warming.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with our findings.\n- \"the overshoot pathway yields higher $T(2100)$\": Correct, $T_O(80) \\approx 7.18\\,\\mathrm{K} > T_H(80) \\approx 6.05\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n- \"and larger ocean heat content\": The total change in heat content of the system is $\\Delta H = \\int_0^{80} C \\frac{dT}{dt} dt = C(T(80) - T(0))$. Since $T_O(80) > T_H(80)$, the heat content is indeed larger for the overshoot pathway.\n- \"due to path dependence arising from finite heat capacity and slow equilibration\": Correct, this is the physical mechanism. The temperature at time $t$ is an integral of the past forcing, weighted by an exponential decay function. The finite value of $C$ creates a thermal lag, making the temperature response path-dependent.\n- The concluding summary is a logical consequence of these points.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. Matching $F(2100)$ guarantees identical cumulative energy uptake by $2100$, so ocean heat content and thermosteric sea level rise must be the same for monotonic and overshoot pathways.**\nThe cumulative energy uptake by the system is the change in its heat content, which is $C \\times T(80)$. Since our calculations show $T_O(80) \\neq T_H(80)$, the cumulative energy uptake is not identical. Consequently, the change in ocean heat content is different for the two pathways. Thermosteric sea level rise is directly linked to ocean heat content; different heat contents imply different amounts of thermal expansion and sea level rise. This statement is fundamentally flawed.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.",

This empirical proportionality is called the Transient Climate Response to cumulative carbon emissions (TCRE). In this framework, adopt the following scientifically standard assumptions: cumulative anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions drive atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration increases through a roughly constant airborne fraction on near-term timescales, carbon dioxide radiative forcing scales approximately as the logarithm of the concentration ratio, and the transient climate response is approximately linear in radiative forcing over these ranges.

The underlying assumptions (logarithmic forcing, linear temperature response, constant airborne fraction) are standard approximations in this context.

The use of a normally distributed parameter and a probability threshold for an outcome defines a solvable problem in statistics.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, standard terminology from climate science and mathematics. It is free from ambiguity, subjectivity, or opinion.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. Proceeding with the solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the remaining carbon budget, $E_{\\mathrm{rem}}$, which is the total future anthropogenic $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ emission that can be released while ensuring the total global warming does not exceed a limit of $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{limit}} = 1.50~\\mathrm{K}$ with a probability of $0.67$.\n\nThe total warming at its peak, $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{total}}$, relative to the preindustrial baseline, is the sum of the currently observed warming, $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{obs}}$, the future warming from non-$\\mathrm{CO}_2$ sources, $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{nc,fut}}$, and the future warming from future $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ emissions, $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{c,fut}}$.\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{obs}} + \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{nc,fut}} + \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{c,fut}}\n$$\nThe future warming from $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ emissions is determined by the TCRE framework. The TCRE constant, $\\alpha$, is given in units of $\\mathrm{K}$ per $1000~\\mathrm{GtCO}_{2}$. For dimensional consistency and clarity, we define a new random variable, $A = \\alpha / 1000$, which represents the TCRE in units of $\\mathrm{K}$ per $\\mathrm{GtCO}_{2}$. The warming from future $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ emissions, $E_{\\mathrm{rem}}$ (in $\\mathrm{GtCO}_{2}$), is then given by:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{c,fut}} = A \\cdot E_{\\mathrm{rem}}\n$$\nSince $\\alpha$ is a normally distributed random variable, $A$ is also normally distributed. The parameters of the distribution for $A$ can be derived from the parameters of $\\alpha$:\n- Mean of $A$: $\\mu_A = \\frac{\\mu_{\\alpha}}{1000} = \\frac{1.65}{1000} = 0.00165~\\mathrm{K/GtCO}_2$\n- Standard deviation of $A$: $\\sigma_A = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\alpha}}{1000} = \\frac{0.45}{1000} = 0.00045~\\mathrm{K/GtCO}_2$\nSo, $A \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_A, \\sigma_A^2)$.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{c,fut}}$ into the total warming equation, we find that $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{total}}$ is a random variable:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{obs}} + \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{nc,fut}} + A \\cdot E_{\\mathrm{rem}}\n$$\nThe problem imposes the probabilistic constraint:\n$$\nP(\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{total}} \\le \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{limit}}) = 0.67\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{total}}$ and the given values:\n$$\nP(1.10~\\mathrm{K} + 0.05~\\mathrm{K} + A \\cdot E_{\\mathrm{rem}} \\le 1.50~\\mathrm{K}) = 0.67\n$$\nWe can rearrange the inequality to isolate the random variable $A$.

Let $Z$ be the standard normal variable, $Z = \\frac{A - \\mu_A}{\\sigma_A}$, where $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$. The inequality becomes:\n$$\nP\\left(\\frac{A - \\mu_A}{\\sigma_A} \\le \\frac{\\frac{0.35}{E_{\\mathrm{rem}}} - \\mu_A}{\\sigma_A}\\right) = 0.67\n$$\nThis is equivalent to $P(Z \\le z_{0.67}) = 0.67$, where $z_{0.67}$ is the $67$-th percentile of the standard normal distribution. By definition, $\\Phi(z_{0.67}) = 0.67$, where $\\Phi$ is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution. We can set the argument of the CDF equal to this critical value:\n$$\n\\frac{\\frac{0.35}{E_{\\mathrm{rem}}} - \\mu_A}{\\sigma_A} = z_{0.67}\n$$\nUsing a standard normal table or a computational tool, we find $z_{0.67} \\approx 0.439913$.

A higher probability of success (e.g., $83$%) would require a larger z-score, leading to a smaller carbon budget, which is a more conservative estimate. Conversely, a $50$% probability ($z=0$) yields a budget based solely on the mean TCRE estimate.",
