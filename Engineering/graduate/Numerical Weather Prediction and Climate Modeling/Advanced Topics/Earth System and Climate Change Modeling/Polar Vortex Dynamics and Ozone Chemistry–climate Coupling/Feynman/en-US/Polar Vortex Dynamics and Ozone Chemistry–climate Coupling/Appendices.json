The concepts of diabatic heating due to ozone photochemistry, Newtonian cooling as a linearization of radiative transfer, and the isolation of the polar vortex are all fundamental and scientifically sound principles in stratospheric dynamics. The provided numerical values for $H$ and $\\tau_{\\mathrm{rad}}$ are physically plausible for the specified context of the lower stratosphere.\n- **Well-Posedness**: The problem is mathematically well-posed.

It is therefore **valid**. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n**Derivation of the Governing Equation**\n\nThe thermodynamic energy equation for a dry atmosphere in pressure coordinates describes the rate of change of temperature, $T$. When averaged over the polar cap and simplified according to the problem statement, the dynamical transport terms (horizontal advection and vertical motion) are assumed to average to zero. The evolution of the polar-cap mean temperature anomaly $T^{\\prime}$ is thus governed solely by the specified diabatic processes.\n\nThe rate of change of the temperature anomaly, $\\frac{dT^{\\prime}}{dt}$, is the sum of the diabatic heating tendency and the radiative cooling tendency.\n\nThe diabatic heating is given as a constant forcing, $H$.\nThe radiative response is described as linear Newtonian cooling, which means the radiative damping rate is proportional to the temperature anomaly itself. This cooling tendency is thus given by $-\\frac{T^{\\prime}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rad}}}$. The negative sign indicates that a positive (warm) anomaly induces cooling.\n\nCombining these terms, we obtain the prognostic ordinary differential equation (ODE) for $T^{\\prime}(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{dT^{\\prime}}{dt} = H - \\frac{T^{\\prime}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rad}}} $$\nThis equation is valid for the period $0 \\le t \\le t_d$.\n\n**Solution of the Ordinary Differential Equation**\n\nTo solve this ODE, we rearrange it into the standard form for a first-order linear differential equation:\n$$ \\frac{dT^{\\prime}}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rad}}}T^{\\prime} = H $$\nWe solve this equation using the method of integrating factors. The integrating factor, $I(t)$, is given by:\n$$ I(t) = \\exp\\left(\\int \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rad}}} \\, dt\\right) = \\exp\\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rad}}}\\right) $$\nMultiplying the ODE by $I(t)$:\n$$ \\exp\\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rad}}}\\right)\\frac{dT^{\\prime}}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rad}}}\\exp\\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rad}}}\\right)T^{\\prime} = H\\exp\\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rad}}}\\right) $$\nThe left-hand side is the derivative of the product $T^{\\prime}(t)I(t)$:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(T^{\\prime}(t)\\exp\\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rad}}}\\right)\\right) = H\\exp\\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rad}}}\\right) $$\nIntegrating both sides with respect to $t$:\n$$ \\int \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(T^{\\prime}(t)\\exp\\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rad}}}\\right)\\right) dt = \\int H\\exp\\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rad}}}\\right) dt $$\n$$ T^{\\prime}(t)\\exp\\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rad}}}\\right) = H\\tau_{\\mathrm{rad}}\\exp\\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rad}}}\\right) + C $$\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration.

A solution will be provided.\n\n***\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts: first, the derivation of the Damköhler number from the governing equation; second, its numerical evaluation; and third, a discussion of the implications for numerical modeling.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Damköhler Number**\n\nWe begin with the tracer continuity equation provided in the problem statement. Substituting the given expressions for the production ($P \\approx 0$) and loss ($L = k\\chi$) terms, the equation for the tracer $\\chi$ inside the SPV becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\chi}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (\\chi \\mathbf{u}) = -k \\chi\n$$\nTo identify the dimensionless parameter that governs the system's behavior, we nondimensionalize this equation. We introduce the following dimensionless variables, denoted with a prime ($'$):\n-   Time: $t' = \\frac{t}{t_{\\mathrm{ref}}}$\n-   Space coordinates: $\\mathbf{x}' = \\frac{\\mathbf{x}}{L_{\\mathrm{char}}}$\n-   Velocity field: $\\mathbf{u}' = \\frac{\\mathbf{u}}{U}$\n-   Tracer concentration: $\\chi' = \\frac{\\chi}{\\chi_{\\mathrm{ref}}}$\n\nHere, $L_{\\mathrm{char}}$ is the characteristic length scale, $U$ is the characteristic velocity scale, and $\\chi_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ is a reference concentration. The reference timescale, $t_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, should be chosen based on a characteristic process. The problem notes a characteristic transport timescale, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{transport}}$, which is the time it takes for a fluid parcel to be advected over the characteristic length scale. Thus, we define $\\tau_{\\mathrm{transport}} \\equiv \\frac{L_{\\mathrm{char}}}{U}$ and set our reference timescale $t_{\\mathrm{ref}} = \\tau_{\\mathrm{transport}}$.\n\nWe now transform the derivatives and terms in the governing equation:\n-   $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial t'}{\\partial t} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t'} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{transport}}} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t'}$\n-   $\\nabla = \\frac{1}{L_{\\mathrm{char}}} \\nabla'$\n\nSubstituting these into the continuity equation:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{transport}}} \\frac{\\partial (\\chi_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\chi')}{\\partial t'} + \\frac{1}{L_{\\mathrm{char}}} \\nabla' \\cdot ((\\chi_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\chi') (U \\mathbf{u}')) = -k (\\chi_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\chi')\n$$\nAssuming $\\chi_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ is a constant, we can divide the entire equation by it:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{transport}}} \\frac{\\partial \\chi'}{\\partial t'} + \\frac{U}{L_{\\mathrm{char}}} \\nabla' \\cdot (\\chi' \\mathbf{u}') = -k \\chi'\n$$\nBy our definition of the transport timescale, $\\frac{U}{L_{\\mathrm{char}}} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{transport}}}$. Substituting this relationship yields:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{transport}}} \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\chi'}{\\partial t'} + \\nabla' \\cdot (\\chi' \\mathbf{u}') \\right) = -k \\chi'\n$$\nTo make the equation fully dimensionless, we multiply all terms by $\\tau_{\\mathrm{transport}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\chi'}{\\partial t'} + \\nabla' \\cdot (\\chi' \\mathbf{u}') = -(k \\cdot \\tau_{\\mathrm{transport}}) \\chi'\n$$\nThe dimensionless group on the right-hand side, $k \\cdot \\tau_{\\mathrm{transport}}$, quantifies the strength of the chemical loss relative to the transport processes. This is the Damköhler number, denoted as $Da$.\nThe problem also defines the chemical timescale as $\\tau_{\\mathrm{chem}} = 1/k$. Using this definition, we can express the Damköhler number as the ratio of the two characteristic timescales:\n$$\nDa = k \\cdot \\tau_{\\mathrm{transport}} = \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{transport}}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{chem}}}\n$$\nThis dimensionless number represents the ratio of the rate of transport to the rate of reaction. If $Da \\gg 1$, the chemical reaction is much faster than transport, and chemistry dominates. If $Da \\ll 1$, transport is much faster than the chemical reaction, and transport dynamics dominate.\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Evaluation of the Damköhler Number**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n-   $\\tau_{\\mathrm{transport}} = 10 \\ \\mathrm{days}$\n-   $\\tau_{\\mathrm{chem}} = 1 \\ \\mathrm{hour}$\n\nTo compute the dimensionless ratio $Da$, both timescales must be in consistent units. We convert days to hours, using the conversion $1 \\ \\mathrm{day} = 24 \\ \\mathrm{hours}$.\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{transport}} = 10 \\ \\mathrm{days} \\times \\frac{24 \\ \\mathrm{hours}}{1 \\ \\mathrm{day}} = 240 \\ \\mathrm{hours}\n$$\nNow we can calculate the Damköhler number:\n$$\nDa = \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{transport}}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{chem}}} = \\frac{240 \\ \\mathrm{hours}}{1 \\ \\mathrm{hour}} = 240\n$$\nThe numerical value of the Damköhler number is $240$.\n\n**Part 3: Implications for Numerical Modeling**\n\nThe calculated Damköhler number, $Da = 240$, is a large number ($Da \\gg 1$). This indicates that the chemical timescale ($\\tau_{\\mathrm{chem}} = 1 \\ \\mathrm{hour}$) is much shorter than the transport timescale ($\\tau_{\\mathrm{transport}} = 10 \\ \\mathrm{days}$). This profound separation of timescales has critical implications for the numerical integration of the governing equation, particularly in the context of operator splitting.\n\n1.  **Numerical Stiffness:** A system of differential equations characterized by widely differing timescales is known as a stiff system. The fast chemical loss introduces a rapidly decaying mode into the solution. A standard explicit time-stepping scheme (e.g., forward Euler, Runge-Kutta) would be forced to use a time step $\\Delta t$ on the order of the fastest timescale ($\\Delta t  \\tau_{\\mathrm{chem}}$) to maintain numerical stability. In a climate model, the dynamical core (advection) typically uses a much longer time step $\\Delta t_{dyn}$ (e.g., $15-60$ minutes) determined by the CFL condition. Using a very small $\\Delta t$ for the entire coupled system would be computationally prohibitive. The value $Da=240$ definitively categorizes the problem as numerically stiff.\n\n2.  **Operator Splitting (OS) Error:** In practice, coupled systems like this are solved using operator splitting, where the advection and chemistry processes are integrated sequentially over a time step $\\Delta t$.\n    $$\n    \\frac{\\partial \\chi}{\\partial t} = \\mathcal{A}(\\chi) + \\mathcal{C}(\\chi)\n    $$\n    Here, $\\mathcal{A}$ is the advection operator and $\\mathcal{C}$ is the chemistry operator. The splitting error depends on the non-commutativity of these operators, $[ \\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{C} ] = \\mathcal{A}\\mathcal{C} - \\mathcal{C}\\mathcal{A}$. For a stiff system ($Da \\gg 1$), the tracer concentration $\\chi$ can change substantially due to chemistry within a single advection step. This makes the operators highly non-commutative, leading to potentially large splitting errors. The state advected is significantly different from the state that underwent reaction, and vice-versa, compromising the accuracy of the simulation if not handled carefully.\n\n3.  **Choice of Numerical Scheme:** Given the stiffness, an explicit treatment of the chemistry term is ill-advised if the model time step $\\Delta t$ is comparable to or larger than $\\tau_{\\mathrm{chem}}$. Two primary strategies exist to handle this stiffness:\n    -   **Implicit Treatment:** The most robust and efficient method for this stiff loss term is to use an implicit or semi-implicit solver for the chemistry step. For the simple first-order loss equation $\\frac{d\\chi}{dt} = -k\\chi$, a backward Euler scheme gives $\\chi^{n+1} = \\chi^n / (1 + k \\Delta t)$. This scheme is unconditionally stable for any $\\Delta t > 0$. Therefore, treating the chemistry implicitly allows the use of a larger timestep $\\Delta t_{dyn}$ dictated by the advection, without succumbing to instability from the fast chemistry. This is the standard approach in modern chemistry-climate models for stiff reactions.\n    -   **Subcycling:** An alternative is to subcycle the chemistry operator. Within one large dynamics timestep $\\Delta t_{dyn}$, the chemistry equation is solved over multiple smaller timesteps $\\Delta t_{chem}$, such that $\\Delta t_{chem} \\ll \\tau_{\\mathrm{chem}}$. This allows the use of a simple explicit solver for the chemistry. However, this increases the computational cost and can still suffer from inaccuracies if the coupling to advection is strong. For very stiff systems, an implicit method is generally superior in both stability and efficiency.\n\nIn conclusion, for simulating polar ozone loss under strong vortex confinement where $Da \\gg 1$, the chemistry term must be identified as stiff and treated with a numerically stable method. The clear recommendation based on first principles is to solve the chemistry implicitly within the operator-split framework to ensure stability and accuracy while using a computationally feasible model time step.",

A gain of $0.8$ indicates that the analysis will be heavily influenced by the observation, which is expected since the observation is twice as certain as the background ($\\sigma_o = \\sigma_b / 2$).\n\nNow, we compute the analysis state $x_a$:\n$$ x_a = x_b + K(y - x_b) $$\n$$ x_a = 300 \\text{ DU} + 0.8 \\times (270 \\text{ DU} - 300 \\text{ DU}) $$\n$$ x_a = 300 \\text{ DU} + 0.8 \\times (-30 \\text{ DU}) $$\n$$ x_a = 300 \\text{ DU} - 24 \\text{ DU} $$\n$$ x_a = 276 \\text{ DU} $$\n\nFinally, we compute the analysis increment $\\delta x$:\n$$ \\delta x = x_a - x_b = 276 \\text{ DU} - 300 \\text{ DU} = -24 \\text{ DU} $$\nAlternatively, using the formula:\n$$ \\delta x = K(y - x_b) = 0.8 \\times (-30 \\text{ DU}) = -24 \\text{ DU} $$\n\nThe question asks for the final numerical answers for $(x_a, \\delta x)$ rounded to four significant figures.\n- $x_a = 276$ becomes $276.0$.\n- $\\delta x = -24$ becomes $-24.00$.\n\nThe final results are $(x_a, \\delta x) = (276.0 \\text{ DU}, -24.00 \\text{ DU})$.",
