            "introduction": "Before we can model the biogeochemical feedbacks from permafrost regions, we must first accurately diagnose the physical extent of thaw from model simulations. A primary indicator for this is the Active Layer Thickness (ALT), which represents the maximum depth of soil that thaws and refreezes annually. This hands-on coding exercise  challenges you to implement a robust algorithm to calculate ALT from discrete soil temperature profiles, an essential and common task for scientists analyzing output from land surface and climate models.",

            "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional soil column in a numerical weather prediction and climate modeling framework. The thermodynamic state of the column is described by the temperature field $T(z,t)$, where $z$ is depth measured positively downward from the ground surface and $t$ is time. The Active Layer Thickness (ALT) is the maximum depth of seasonally thawed soil, defined for permafrost as the deepest position of the thaw front that occurs during the warm season. Assume the following scientific bases: energy conservation in a continuum and phase change at the melting temperature enforce that the thaw front location satisfies $T(z,t) = T_{\\mathrm{m}}$ at the interface between thawed and frozen soil; perennially frozen soil below the active layer remains below the melting temperature during the warm season. In a discretized soil column with finite depth nodes, the thaw front is inferred from model outputs of $T(z,t)$ without directly tracking latent heat.\n\nDefinition of Active Layer Thickness (ALT) for this problem: For each warm season time $t$ in a prescribed index set $\\mathcal{W}$, define the contiguous thaw depth at time $t$ as the largest depth $z^{\\ast}(t)$ such that $T(z',t) \\ge T_{\\mathrm{m}}$ for all depths $z' \\in [0,z^{\\ast}(t)]$, with the additional requirement that $T(0,t) \\ge T_{\\mathrm{m}}$ at that time. The seasonal Active Layer Thickness is then $\\mathrm{ALT} = \\max_{t \\in \\mathcal{W}} z^{\\ast}(t)$. If, at time $t$, there is a depth interval $[z_i, z_{i+1}]$ in the discrete grid where $T(z_i,t) \\ge T_{\\mathrm{m}}$ and $T(z_{i+1},t) < T_{\\mathrm{m}}$, infer the thaw front within that interval by a consistent monotone interpolation in $z$ based on the local temperature profile. If $T(0,t) < T_{\\mathrm{m}}$ for a given $t$, then $z^{\\ast}(t) = 0$ by the contiguity requirement. If all depths in the grid satisfy $T(z,t) \\ge T_{\\mathrm{m}}$ at a time $t$, then $z^{\\ast}(t)$ equals the maximum grid depth.\n\nYour task: Implement a program to compute $\\mathrm{ALT}$ for each of the provided test cases, using the above contiguous thaw depth criterion and an appropriate interpolation when the thaw front lies between depth nodes. Express all $\\mathrm{ALT}$ values in meters, rounded to four decimal places. Angles do not appear in this problem. The temperature unit is Kelvin, and depth is in meters. Time is given as discrete indices.\n\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets (e.g., \"[$\\mathrm{ALT}_1,\\mathrm{ALT}_2,\\dots$]\"), where each entry is a floating-point number representing the $\\mathrm{ALT}$ for the corresponding test case in meters, rounded to four decimal places.\n\nTest Suite:\n\nTest Case $1$ (general warm-season thaw progression; \"happy path\"):\n- Depth grid $z = [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n- Warm season time indices $\\mathcal{W} = \\{0,1,2,3,4,5\\}$.\n- Melting temperature $T_{\\mathrm{m}} = 273.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n- Temperatures $T(z,t)$ at each time:\n  - $t=0$: $[274.0, 272.5, 271.5, 270.5, 269.5]\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n  - $t=1$: $[275.0, 274.0, 272.8, 271.0, 270.0]\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n  - $t=2$: $[276.0, 275.0, 274.0, 272.5, 271.0]\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n  - $t=3$: $[277.0, 276.0, 275.0, 273.5, 272.0]\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n  - $t=4$: $[276.5, 275.5, 274.5, 273.2, 272.2]\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n  - $t=5$: $[275.0, 274.0, 273.7, 273.0, 272.5]\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nTest Case $2$ (no surface thaw; deeper warming non-contiguous with the surface):\n- Depth grid $z = [0.0, 0.5, 1.0]\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n- Warm season time indices $\\mathcal{W} = \\{0,1,2\\}$.\n- Melting temperature $T_{\\mathrm{m}} = 273.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n- Temperatures:\n  - $t=0$: $[272.0, 274.0, 274.5]\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n  - $t=1$: $[272.5, 273.5, 274.5]\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n  - $t=2$: $[272.8, 274.2, 274.8]\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nTest Case $3$ (threshold equality and full-column thaw at a time):\n- Depth grid $z = [0.0, 0.5, 1.0]\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n- Warm season time indices $\\mathcal{W} = \\{0,1,2\\}$.\n- Melting temperature $T_{\\mathrm{m}} = 273.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n- Temperatures:\n  - $t=0$: $[273.15, 273.15, 272.0]\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n  - $t=1$: $[273.15, 273.20, 273.15]\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n  - $t=2$: $[273.10, 273.18, 273.16]\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nTest Case $4$ (mid-depth cold barrier preventing contiguity to deeper thawed layers):\n- Depth grid $z = [0.0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2]\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n- Warm season time indices $\\mathcal{W} = \\{0,1,2,3\\}$.\n- Melting temperature $T_{\\mathrm{m}} = 273.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n- Temperatures:\n  - $t=0$: $[274.0, 273.8, 272.7, 274.0]\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n  - $t=1$: $[275.0, 274.2, 272.9, 273.5]\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n  - $t=2$: $[274.5, 273.5, 273.0, 272.8]\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n  - $t=3$: $[273.8, 273.4, 272.6, 272.5]\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nTest Case $5$ (freezing point depression; lower effective threshold):\n- Depth grid $z = [0.0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, 1.2]\\,\\mathrm{m}$.\n- Warm season time indices $\\mathcal{W} = \\{0,1,2,3\\}$.\n- Melting temperature $T_{\\mathrm{m}} = 272.5\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n- Temperatures:\n  - $t=0$: $[273.0, 272.7, 272.3, 271.9, 271.5]\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n  - $t=1$: $[273.2, 272.9, 272.6, 272.2, 271.8]\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n  - $t=2$: $[273.1, 273.0, 272.8, 272.4, 272.0]\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n  - $t=3$: $[272.9, 272.8, 272.7, 272.5, 272.3]\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nImplementation requirements:\n- For each test case, evaluate $z^{\\ast}(t)$ across the specified warm season index set $\\mathcal{W}$ and report $\\mathrm{ALT}$ as the maximum value of $z^{\\ast}(t)$ over $t \\in \\mathcal{W}$.\n- Use a depth-wise monotone interpolation when the thaw front lies strictly between two consecutive depth nodes where temperatures straddle $T_{\\mathrm{m}}$.\n- Return results as a single-line list of floats in meters, rounded to four decimal places, in the order of the test cases $1$ through $5$.",
            "solution": "The problem has been validated and is deemed scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. The provided definitions and data are sufficient and consistent for deriving a unique, meaningful solution. The physical context is based on standard principles of thermodynamics and permafrost geophysics as employed in climate modeling. The task is a direct application of these principles to discrete data.\n\nThe objective is to compute the seasonal Active Layer Thickness, denoted $\\mathrm{ALT}$, for five distinct test cases. The $\\mathrm{ALT}$ is defined as the maximum contiguous thaw depth, $z^{\\ast}(t)$, that occurs over a specified set of warm season time indices, $\\mathcal{W}$.\n$$\n\\mathrm{ALT} = \\max_{t \\in \\mathcal{W}} z^{\\ast}(t)\n$$\nThe core of the problem is to determine the contiguous thaw depth, $z^{\\ast}(t)$, for a given one-dimensional temperature profile $T(z,t)$ at a specific time $t$. The temperature profile is provided at discrete depth nodes $z_i$, where $i=0, 1, \\dots, N$. The depth $z$ is measured positively downwards from the surface, so $z_0=0$.\n\nThe algorithm to compute $z^{\\ast}(t)$ for a single time step is as follows:\n\n1.  **Check Surface Condition**: The definition requires that the thaw be contiguous with the surface. Therefore, we first check the surface temperature, $T(z_0, t) = T(0, t)$. If $T(0, t) < T_{\\mathrm{m}}$, where $T_{\\mathrm{m}}$ is the melting temperature, the ground is frozen at the surface. By the contiguity requirement, the thaw depth is zero, irrespective of temperatures at deeper layers. Thus, $z^{\\ast}(t) = 0$.\n\n2.  **Iterate Through Depth Nodes**: If $T(0, t) \\ge T_{\\mathrm{m}}$, we proceed to find the maximum depth of the contiguous thawed layer. We iterate downwards through the depth nodes $z_i$ for $i = 1, 2, \\dots, N$. We search for the first depth index $i$ at which the temperature drops below the melting point, i.e., $T(z_i, t) < T_{\\mathrm{m}}$.\n\n3.  **Determine Thaw Depth**:\n    a. **Thaw Front Between Nodes**: If such an index $i$ is found, it signifies that the soil is thawed (or at the melting point) down to depth $z_{i-1}$, since $T(z_j, t) \\ge T_{\\mathrm{m}}$ for all $j < i$. The thaw front, where $T(z,t) = T_{\\mathrm{m}}$, lies in the interval $[z_{i-1}, z_i]$. The problem specifies using a \"consistent monotone interpolation\" to find the exact location. Linear interpolation is the standard and appropriate choice. Given the two points $(z_{i-1}, T(z_{i-1}, t))$ and $(z_i, T(z_i, t))$, we find the depth $z^{\\ast}(t)$ where the linearly interpolated temperature equals $T_{\\mathrm{m}}$. The equation for the line connecting the two points is:\n    $$\n    \\frac{z - z_{i-1}}{z_i - z_{i-1}} = \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{m}} - T(z_{i-1}, t)}{T(z_i, t) - T(z_{i-1}, t)}\n    $$\n    Solving for $z$, which we identify as $z^{\\ast}(t)$, yields:\n    $$\n    z^{\\ast}(t) = z_{i-1} + (z_i - z_{i-1}) \\frac{T_{\\mathrm{m}} - T(z_{i-1}, t)}{T(z_i, t) - T(z_{i-1}, t)}\n    $$\n    A special case within this is if $T(z_{i-1}, t) = T_{\\mathrm{m}}$, in which case the formula correctly simplifies to $z^{\\ast}(t) = z_{i-1}$.\n\n    b. **Full Column Thaw**: If the loop completes without finding any depth $z_i$ where $T(z_i, t) < T_{\\mathrm{m}}$, it means that $T(z_i, t) \\ge T_{\\mathrm{m}}$ for all nodes in the grid. In this scenario, the entire modeled soil column is thawed. The contiguous thaw depth $z^{\\ast}(t)$ is therefore equal to the maximum depth of the grid, $z_N$.\n\nBy applying this procedure for each time $t \\in \\mathcal{W}$, we obtain a set of seasonal thaw depths $\\{z^{\\ast}(t)\\}$. The final $\\mathrm{ALT}$ for a given test case is the maximum value in this set. This entire process is repeated for each of the five test cases provided. The final result for each case is rounded to four decimal places.",
