            "problem": "In coupling land ice sheet dynamics to atmospheric and oceanic components in numerical weather prediction and climate modeling, the rheology of polycrystalline ice is commonly represented by Glen’s flow law, with a temperature-dependent rate factor.

It is a standard, formalizable problem in geophysical fluid dynamics.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is determined to be **valid**. A full solution is warranted.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of effective viscosity $\\eta$**\nThe task is to relate the effective viscosity $\\eta$ from the Newtonian-form constitutive relation to the parameters of Glen's flow law. We begin with the definition of the second invariant of the deviatoric strain-rate tensor:\n$$ \\dot{\\epsilon}_{e} = \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\dot{\\epsilon}_{ij}^{\\prime}\\dot{\\epsilon}_{ij}^{\\prime} \\right)^{1/2} $$\nThe problem provides a constitutive relation in the form of a generalized Newtonian fluid:\n$$ \\dot{\\epsilon}_{ij}^{\\prime} = \\frac{1}{2\\eta}\\,\\tau_{ij}^{\\prime} $$\nWe substitute this relation into the definition of $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{e}$:\n$$ \\dot{\\epsilon}_{e} = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{2\\eta}\\,\\tau_{ij}^{\\prime} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{2\\eta}\\,\\tau_{ij}^{\\prime} \\right) \\right)^{1/2} $$\nSince the effective viscosity $\\eta$ is a scalar, we can factor it out of the summation:\n$$ \\dot{\\epsilon}_{e} = \\left( \\frac{1}{(2\\eta)^{2}} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\tau_{ij}^{\\prime}\\tau_{ij}^{\\prime} \\right) \\right)^{1/2} $$\nTaking the square root of the term involving $\\eta$ gives:\n$$ \\dot{\\epsilon}_{e} = \\frac{1}{2\\eta} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}\\,\\tau_{ij}^{\\prime}\\tau_{ij}^{\\prime} \\right)^{1/2} $$\nWe recognize the term in the parenthesis as the definition of the second invariant of the deviatoric stress tensor, $\\tau_{e}$. Thus, the relationship between the invariants is:\n$$ \\dot{\\epsilon}_{e} = \\frac{1}{2\\eta}\\,\\tau_{e} $$\nNow, we equate this result with the expression given by Glen's flow law, $\\dot{\\epsilon}_{e} = A(T)\\,\\tau_{e}^{n}$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2\\eta}\\,\\tau_{e} = A(T)\\,\\tau_{e}^{n} $$\nWe can now solve for the effective viscosity $\\eta$. Assuming $\\tau_e \\neq 0$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2\\eta} = A(T)\\,\\frac{\\tau_{e}^{n}}{\\tau_{e}} = A(T)\\,\\tau_{e}^{n-1} $$\nInverting this expression yields the effective viscosity:\n$$ \\eta = \\frac{1}{2 A(T)\\,\\tau_{e}^{n-1}} $$\nThis is the required expression for $\\eta$ as a function of $A(T)$, $\\tau_{e}$, and $n$.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of the viscosity ratio**\nFirst, we specialize the result from Part 1 to the case where the stress exponent $n=3$:\n$$ \\eta(T) = \\frac{1}{2 A(T)\\,\\tau_{e}^{3-1}} = \\frac{1}{2 A(T)\\,\\tau_{e}^{2}} $$\nThe problem asks for the dimensionless ratio $\\eta(T_{0}+\\Delta T)/\\eta(T_{0})$, where $T_{0}$ is the initial temperature, for a fixed value of $\\tau_{e}$. Let us denote the initial temperature as $T$ for simplicity. The viscosity at temperature $T+\\Delta T$ is:\n$$ \\eta(T+\\Delta T) = \\frac{1}{2 A(T+\\Delta T)\\,\\tau_{e}^{2}} $$\nThe ratio is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{\\eta(T+\\Delta T)}{\\eta(T)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2 A(T+\\Delta T)\\,\\tau_{e}^{2}}}{\\frac{1}{2 A(T)\\,\\tau_{e}^{2}}} $$\nThe terms $1/2$ and $1/\\tau_e^2$ are common to both the numerator and the denominator and thus cancel out:\n$$ \\frac{\\eta(T+\\Delta T)}{\\eta(T)} = \\frac{A(T)}{A(T+\\Delta T)} $$\nNext, we substitute the Arrhenius expression for the rate factor, $A(T) = A_{0}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\tfrac{Q}{R\\,T}\\right)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\eta(T+\\Delta T)}{\\eta(T)} = \\frac{A_{0}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{Q}{R\\,T}\\right)}{A_{0}\\,\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{Q}{R\\,(T+\\Delta T)}\\right)} $$\nThe prefactor $A_0$ cancels. Using the property $\\exp(a)/\\exp(b) = \\exp(a-b)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\eta(T+\\Delta T)}{\\eta(T)} = \\exp\\!\\left( -\\frac{Q}{R\\,T} - \\left(-\\frac{Q}{R\\,(T+\\Delta T)}\\right) \\right) = \\exp\\!\\left( \\frac{Q}{R\\,(T+\\Delta T)} - \\frac{Q}{R\\,T} \\right) $$\nFactoring out the common term $Q/R$:\n$$ \\frac{\\eta(T+\\Delta T)}{\\eta(T)} = \\exp\\!\\left[ \\frac{Q}{R} \\left( \\frac{1}{T+\\Delta T} - \\frac{1}{T} \\right) \\right] $$\nCombining the fractions inside the parenthesis:\n$$ \\frac{1}{T+\\Delta T} - \\frac{1}{T} = \\frac{T - (T+\\Delta T)}{T(T+\\Delta T)} = \\frac{-\\Delta T}{T(T+\\Delta T)} $$\nSubstituting this back into the exponential yields the final analytical expression for the ratio:\n$$ \\frac{\\eta(T+\\Delta T)}{\\eta(T)} = \\exp\\!\\left[ -\\frac{Q\\,\\Delta T}{R\\,T(T+\\Delta T)} \\right] $$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values. First, we convert the initial temperature to Kelvin:\n$T = -10\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C} + 273.15 = 263.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$\nThe final temperature is:\n$T+\\Delta T = 263.15\\,\\mathrm{K} + 5\\,\\mathrm{K} = 268.15\\,\\mathrm{K}$\nThe given constants are:\n$Q = 6.0\\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$\n$R = 8.314462618\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n$\\Delta T = 5\\,\\mathrm{K}$\nSubstituting these values into the derived expression:\n$$ \\frac{\\eta(T+\\Delta T)}{\\eta(T)} = \\exp\\!\\left[ -\\frac{(6.0\\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}})\\,(5\\,\\mathrm{K})}{(8.314462618\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}})\\,(263.15\\,\\mathrm{K})(268.15\\,\\mathrm{K})} \\right] $$\nCalculating the argument of the exponential:\n$$ \\text{Argument} = -\\frac{3.0\\times 10^{5}}{8.314462618 \\times 263.15 \\times 268.15} \\approx -\\frac{3.0\\times 10^{5}}{586737.846} \\approx -0.5113061 $$\nEvaluating the exponential:\n$$ \\frac{\\eta(T+\\Delta T)}{\\eta(T)} \\approx \\exp(-0.5113061) \\approx 0.5997116 $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as required:\n$$ \\frac{\\eta(T+\\Delta T)}{\\eta(T)} \\approx 0.5997 $$\nThis result signifies that a $5\\,\\mathrm{K}$ warming from $-10\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$ reduces the effective viscosity of ice by approximately $40\\%$, making it flow significantly faster under the same stress.",

            "problem": "Consider a marine ice sheet terminating in a floating ice shelf, described along a single flowline coordinate $x$ increasing seaward.

If you introduce additional symbols, define them clearly.",
            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the grounding-line position, $x_{g}$, and its change, $\\Delta x_{g}$, in response to a change in sea level, $\\Delta SL$, based on first principles of hydrostatic balance.\n\nFirst, we establish the condition for flotation at the grounding line, $x = x_{g}$. The ice sheet becomes a floating ice shelf at the point where the total downward vertical pressure at the ice base is balanced by the upward hydrostatic pressure of the ocean water.\n\nThe total downward pressure, $P_{\\downarrow}$, is the sum of the glaciostatic pressure from the ice column of thickness $H_{g}$ and the additional compressive normal stress from shelf buttressing, $\\tau_{b}$. The problem specifies that $\\tau_{b}$ opposes flotation, which in the context of a vertical stress balance means it acts downward, adding to the ice overburden pressure.\n$$\nP_{\\downarrow} = \\rho_{i} g H_{g} + \\tau_{b}\n$$\nHere, $\\rho_{i}$ is the ice density and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.\n\nThe upward pressure, $P_{\\uparrow}$, is the hydrostatic pressure exerted by the seawater column at the base of the ice. The sea surface is at an elevation $SL$, and the ice base is at the bed elevation $b(x_{g})$. The depth of the water column is therefore $SL - b(x_{g})$. The seawater pressure is:\n$$\nP_{\\uparrow} = \\rho_{w} g (SL - b(x_{g}))\n$$\nwhere $\\rho_{w}$ is the seawater density. This is valid provided the ice base is below sea level, i.e., $b(x_g)  SL$, which is a necessary condition for a marine-terminating ice sheet.\n\nAt the grounding line, $x = x_{g}$, these pressures are in equilibrium: $P_{\\downarrow} = P_{\\uparrow}$.\n$$\n\\rho_{i} g H_{g} + \\tau_{b} = \\rho_{w} g (SL - b(x_{g}))\n$$\nThis equation represents the flotation criterion. We are given the bed elevation as a linear function of position: $b(x) = b_{0} + s\\,x$. Substituting this for $x=x_g$ gives:\n$$\n\\rho_{i} g H_{g} + \\tau_{b} = \\rho_{w} g (SL - (b_{0} + s\\,x_{g}))\n$$\nWe can now solve this linear equation for the grounding-line position $x_{g}$.\n$$\n\\rho_{i} g H_{g} + \\tau_{b} = \\rho_{w} g SL - \\rho_{w} g b_{0} - \\rho_{w} g s\\,x_{g}\n$$\nRearranging to isolate the term with $x_{g}$:\n$$\n\\rho_{w} g s\\,x_{g} = \\rho_{w} g SL - \\rho_{w} g b_{0} - \\rho_{i} g H_{g} - \\tau_{b}\n$$\nSince it is given that $s \\neq 0$, and $\\rho_{w}$ and $g$ are non-zero constants, we can divide by $\\rho_{w} g s$ to obtain the expression for $x_{g}$:\n$$\nx_{g} = \\frac{\\rho_{w} g SL - \\rho_{w} g b_{0} - \\rho_{i} g H_{g} - \\tau_{b}}{\\rho_{w} g s}\n$$\nThis can be written more cleanly as:\n$$\nx_{g} = \\frac{1}{s} \\left( SL - b_{0} - \\frac{\\rho_{i}}{\\rho_{w}} H_{g} - \\frac{\\tau_{b}}{\\rho_{w} g} \\right)\n$$\nThis is the required expression for the grounding-line position as a function of the given parameters.\n\nNext, we compute the change in grounding-line position, $\\Delta x_{g}$, resulting from a small, uniform change in sea level, $\\Delta SL$. The problem states that for this perturbation, the grounding-line thickness $H_{g}$ and the backstress $\\tau_{b}$ can be treated as constants. The parameters $b_{0}$, $s$, $\\rho_{i}$, $\\rho_{w}$, and $g$ are also constants.\n\nLet the initial state be $(x_{g}, SL)$ and the new state after the sea level change be $(x_{g}', SL')$, where $x_{g}' = x_{g} + \\Delta x_{g}$ and $SL' = SL + \\Delta SL$. The same flotation physics must apply at the new equilibrium position. The key physical insight is that since $H_{g}$ and $\\tau_{b}$ are constant, the required depth of the water column for flotation remains unchanged. Let $h_{f} = (\\rho_{i}/\\rho_{w})H_g + \\tau_b/(\\rho_w g)$ be the effective water-equivalent ice thickness.\nThe flotation condition is simply that the water depth above the bed, $SL - b(x)$, must equal $h_{f}$ at the grounding line.\nInitial state:\n$$\nSL - b(x_g) = \\frac{\\rho_{i}}{\\rho_{w}}H_{g} + \\frac{\\tau_{b}}{\\rho_{w} g}\n$$\nNew state:\n$$\nSL' - b(x_g') = \\frac{\\rho_{i}}{\\rho_{w}}H_{g} + \\frac{\\tau_{b}}{\\rho_{w} g}\n$$\nSince the right-hand sides are identical, we must have:\n$$\nSL' - b(x_g') = SL - b(x_g)\n$$\nSubstitute $SL' = SL + \\Delta SL$, $b(x_g) = b_0 + sx_g$, and $b(x_g') = b_0 + sx_g'$:\n$$\n(SL + \\Delta SL) - (b_{0} + s\\,x_{g}') = SL - (b_{0} + s\\,x_{g})\n$$\nThe terms $SL$ and $b_{0}$ cancel out:\n$$\n\\Delta SL - s\\,x_{g}' = - s\\,x_{g}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta SL = s\\,x_{g}' - s\\,x_{g} = s(x_{g}' - x_{g})\n$$\nRecognizing that $x_{g}' - x_{g} = \\Delta x_{g}$, we arrive at the expression for the change in grounding-line position:\n$$\n\\Delta SL = s\\,\\Delta x_{g} \\implies \\Delta x_{g} = \\frac{\\Delta SL}{s}\n$$\nAlternatively, this result can be obtained by taking the partial derivative of the expression for $x_g$ with respect to $SL$. The sensitivity of $x_g$ to $SL$ is $\\frac{\\partial x_{g}}{\\partial SL}$. For a small change $\\Delta SL$, $\\Delta x_{g} \\approx \\frac{\\partial x_{g}}{\\partial SL} \\Delta SL$. Since the relationship is linear, this approximation is exact.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial x_{g}}{\\partial SL} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial SL} \\left[ \\frac{1}{s} \\left( SL - b_{0} - \\frac{\\rho_{i}}{\\rho_{w}} H_{g} - \\frac{\\tau_{b}}{\\rho_{w} g} \\right) \\right] = \\frac{1}{s}\n$$\nTherefore, $\\Delta x_{g} = \\frac{1}{s} \\Delta SL$.\n\nFinally, we articulate the physical roles of the parameters.\nThe grounding-line thickness $H_{g}$ and the backstress $\\tau_{b}$ determine the absolute position of the grounding line. A larger $H_g$ or a larger $\\tau_b$ requires a greater water depth to achieve flotation. To find this greater depth, the grounding line must move to a location where the bed $b(x)$ is lower.\n\nHowever, the sensitivity of the grounding line position to changes in sea level, $\\frac{\\Delta x_{g}}{\\Delta SL} = \\frac{1}{s}$, is modulated only by the bed slope $s$ under the crucial assumption that $H_g$ and $\\tau_b$ are constant. This is because a constant $H_g$ and $\\tau_b$ dictates a constant flotation depth. When sea level rises by $\\Delta SL$, the grounding line must migrate to a new location where the bed is higher by exactly $\\Delta SL$ to restore the original water depth. The horizontal distance required to achieve this vertical change in bed elevation is determined solely by the slope $s = \\frac{\\Delta b}{\\Delta x}$. Thus, $\\Delta x_g = \\frac{\\Delta b}{s} = \\frac{\\Delta SL}{s}$.\n\nThe bed slope $s$ is the primary modulator of sensitivity:\n- A small magnitude of $s$ (a flat bed) leads to a large sensitivity. A small change in $SL$ causes a large advance or retreat of the grounding line.\n- A large magnitude of $s$ (a steep bed) leads to a low sensitivity. The grounding line is more stable.\n- The sign of $s$ determines the direction of response. Since $x$ increases seaward, a retrograde bed slope (deepening inland) corresponds to $s > 0$. A prograde slope (shallowing inland) corresponds to $s  0$. For a sea level rise ($\\Delta SL > 0$), a retrograde slope ($s>0$) results in an advance ($\\Delta x_g > 0$), while a prograde slope ($s0$) results in a retreat ($\\Delta x_g  0$). The advance on a retrograde slope is a well-known feature of this simplified model and is a precursor to marine ice sheet instability, which arises when feedbacks (e.g., changes in $H_g$ with position) are included.\nIn summary, $H_g$ and $\\tau_b$ set the equilibrium position, but under the problem's simplifying assumptions, they do not modulate the sensitivity to sea-level perturbations; this role is entirely played by the bed slope $s$.",

Dividing by the ocean area $A_o = 4\\pi R^2 f_o$ yields the eustatic sea level change\n$$\n\\Delta \\zeta = \\frac{\\Delta V}{A_o} = \\frac{\\Delta M/\\rho_w}{4\\pi R^2 f_o} = \\frac{\\Delta M}{\\rho_w\\,4\\pi R^2 f_o}.\n$$\n\nBy the stated modeling assumption, the far-field sea level rise is taken to be dominated by this eustatic component at the antipode, with SAL corrections negligible there. Therefore,\n$$\n\\eta_{\\text{far}} = \\Delta \\zeta = \\frac{\\Delta M}{\\rho_w\\,4\\pi R^2 f_o}.\n$$\n\nNext, derive the near-field sea level change at the cap edge ($\\theta = \\theta_0$) by combining eustatic, self-attraction, and loading terms:\n- Hydrostatic equilibrium and the equipotential condition imply that, for a change $\\delta \\Phi$ in the gravitational potential at the sea surface, the local sea surface height change $\\eta$ must satisfy $g\\,\\eta + \\delta \\Phi = \\text{constant}$. If only the gravitational potential were changed by removal of the ice mass, the sea surface height adjustment at fixed potential would be $\\eta_g = -\\delta \\Phi/g$.\n- Under the point-mass approximation for the external field, the gravitational potential change outside the cap due to removal of mass $\\Delta M$ located at the cap centroid is\n$$\n\\delta \\Phi(\\theta) = +\\frac{G\\,\\Delta M}{d(\\theta)},\n$$\nwhere the plus sign reflects that the potential becomes less negative when the mass is removed. At the cap edge, the separation distance is\n$$\nd(\\theta_0) = 2 R \\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{\\theta_0}{2}\\right),\n$$\nand the corresponding self-attraction sea level correction is\n$$\n\\eta_g(\\theta_0) = -\\frac{\\delta \\Phi(\\theta_0)}{g} = -\\frac{G\\,\\Delta M}{g\\,2 R \\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{\\theta_0}{2}\\right)}.\n$$\n\n- The loading correction stems from the solid Earth’s vertical displacement due to reduction in ice pressure by $\\Delta p$. The pressure decrease due to removing the ice mass $\\Delta M$ uniformly over the cap area $A_{\\text{cap}}$ is, by definition of pressure as force per area, with weight $g$ per unit mass,\n$$\n\\Delta p = \\frac{g\\,\\Delta M}{A_{\\text{cap}}} = \\frac{g\\,\\Delta M}{2\\pi R^2 (1 - \\cos \\theta_0)}.\n$$\nUnder the given local compliance model, the upward displacement beneath the cap is $w = C\\,\\Delta p$. A sea level change relative to the solid Earth due to this uplift is $-\\!w$, so the loading contribution to near-field sea level at the cap edge is approximated as\n$$\n\\eta_{\\ell}(\\theta_0) = - C\\,\\Delta p = -\\frac{C\\,g\\,\\Delta M}{2\\pi R^2 (1 - \\cos \\theta_0)}.\n$$\n\nCombining the contributions, the near-field sea level change at the cap edge is\n$$\n\\eta_{\\text{near}} = \\Delta \\zeta + \\eta_g(\\theta_0) + \\eta_{\\ell}(\\theta_0)\n= \\frac{\\Delta M}{\\rho_w\\,4\\pi R^2 f_o}\n- \\frac{G\\,\\Delta M}{g\\,2 R \\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{\\theta_0}{2}\\right)}\n- \\frac{C\\,g\\,\\Delta M}{2\\pi R^2 (1 - \\cos \\theta_0)}.\n$$\n\nFinally, define the fingerprint amplitude at the cap edge as the ratio of near-field sea level change to the far-field (eustatic) sea level change,\n$$\n\\mathcal{F} \\equiv \\frac{\\eta_{\\text{near}}}{\\eta_{\\text{far}}}.\n$$\nSubstituting the results,\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}\n= \\frac{\\frac{\\Delta M}{\\rho_w\\,4\\pi R^2 f_o}\n- \\frac{G\\,\\Delta M}{g\\,2 R \\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{\\theta_0}{2}\\right)}\n- \\frac{C\\,g\\,\\Delta M}{2\\pi R^2 (1 - \\cos \\theta_0)}}{\\frac{\\Delta M}{\\rho_w\\,4\\pi R^2 f_o}}\n= 1\n- \\frac{\\frac{G\\,\\Delta M}{g\\,2 R \\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{\\theta_0}{2}\\right)}}{\\frac{\\Delta M}{\\rho_w\\,4\\pi R^2 f_o}}\n- \\frac{\\frac{C\\,g\\,\\Delta M}{2\\pi R^2 (1 - \\cos \\theta_0)}}{\\frac{\\Delta M}{\\rho_w\\,4\\pi R^2 f_o}}.\n$$\nCanceling $\\Delta M$ and simplifying each term yields\n$$\n\\mathcal{F}\n= 1\n- \\frac{G\\,\\rho_w\\,4\\pi R^2 f_o}{g\\,2 R \\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{\\theta_0}{2}\\right)}\n- \\frac{C\\,g\\,\\rho_w\\,4\\pi R^2 f_o}{2\\pi R^2 (1 - \\cos \\theta_0)}\n= 1\n- \\frac{2\\pi\\,G\\,\\rho_w\\,R\\,f_o}{g\\,\\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{\\theta_0}{2}\\right)}\n- \\frac{2\\,C\\,g\\,\\rho_w\\,f_o}{1 - \\cos \\theta_0}.\n$$\n\nCollecting the three requested expressions,\n$$\n\\eta_{\\text{far}} = \\frac{\\Delta M}{\\rho_w\\,4\\pi R^2 f_o}, \\quad\n\\eta_{\\text{near}} = \\frac{\\Delta M}{\\rho_w\\,4\\pi R^2 f_o}\n- \\frac{G\\,\\Delta M}{g\\,2 R \\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{\\theta_0}{2}\\right)}\n- \\frac{C\\,g\\,\\Delta M}{2\\pi R^2 (1 - \\cos \\theta_0)}, \\quad\n\\mathcal{F} = 1\n- \\frac{2\\pi\\,G\\,\\rho_w\\,R\\,f_o}{g\\,\\sin\\!\\left(\\frac{\\theta_0}{2}\\right)}\n- \\frac{2\\,C\\,g\\,\\rho_w\\,f_o}{1 - \\cos \\theta_0}.\n$$\n\nThese are closed-form analytic expressions in terms of the specified parameters. They embody conservation of mass for the eustatic baseline, the equipotential response for self-attraction, and a local unloading relation for solid Earth uplift, under the stated simplifications suitable for a spherical Earth model in advanced land ice–ocean coupling studies.",
