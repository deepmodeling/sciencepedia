We will model the evolution of a technology's \"knowledge stock\" and its resulting unit cost over several time periods. This exercise  demonstrates the critical interplay between investment in research and development (R&D), which builds knowledge, and depreciation, which represents knowledge \"forgetting\" or obsolescence. By simulating these dynamics, you will gain a concrete understanding of how a technology's cost competitiveness is not fixed but actively maintained or improved through endogenous activities.",

            "problem": "Consider a single-technology energy system model in discrete time with periods indexed by $t \\in \\{0,1,2,3\\}$. The technology’s knowledge stock $K_t$ evolves according to a stock–flow identity with depreciation and inflow from Research and Development (R). Specifically, depreciation reduces the existing stock in proportion to the current stock at rate $\\delta$, while R $R_t$ augments the stock with productivity $\\phi$. The unit production cost $c_t$ is assumed to be governed by learning-by-research, represented by an exponential relationship between cost and the deviation of the knowledge stock from a baseline, scaled by a responsiveness parameter $\\mu$.

            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of energy systems modeling, is well-posed with all necessary information provided, and is formulated objectively. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nFirst, we must formalize the mathematical models described in the problem statement.\nThe evolution of the technology's knowledge stock, $K_t$, is described by a stock-flow identity. The stock at the end of period $t-1$ (or start of period $t$), denoted $K_t$, is equal to the stock from the previous period, $K_{t-1}$, reduced by depreciation at a rate $\\delta$, plus the inflow from Research and Development (R) of the previous period, $R_{t-1}$, which augments the stock with productivity $\\phi$. The governing equation is:\n$$K_t = (1-\\delta)K_{t-1} + \\phi R_{t-1}$$\nThis equation holds for $t \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$.\n\nThe unit production cost, $c_t$, is determined by an exponential learning-by-research model. The cost at time $t$ is a function of the knowledge stock $K_t$ relative to a baseline knowledge stock $K_0$ and baseline cost $c_0$. The relationship is scaled by a responsiveness parameter $\\mu$. The equation is:\n$$c_t = c_0 \\exp(-\\mu(K_t - K_0))$$\n\nThe given parameter values are:\nDepreciation rate, $\\delta = 0.1$.\nR productivity, $\\phi = 0.5$.\nCost responsiveness parameter, $\\mu = 0.2$.\nBaseline knowledge stock, $K_0 = 100$.\nBaseline unit cost, $c_0 = 50$.\nR path for $t=0,1,2$ is $R_0 = 10$, $R_1 = 10$, and $R_2 = 10$.\n\nThe first task is to compute the trajectory of the knowledge stock $K_t$ for $t=1,2,3$.\nFor $t=1$:\n$K_1 = (1-\\delta)K_0 + \\phi R_0$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$K_1 = (1-0.1) \\times 100 + 0.5 \\times 10 = 0.9 \\times 100 + 5 = 90 + 5 = 95$.\n\nFor $t=2$:\n$K_2 = (1-\\delta)K_1 + \\phi R_1$\nUsing the calculated value of $K_1$:\n$K_2 = (1-0.1) \\times 95 + 0.5 \\times 10 = 0.9 \\times 95 + 5 = 85.5 + 5 = 90.5$.\n\nFor $t=3$:\n$K_3 = (1-\\delta)K_2 + \\phi R_2$\nUsing the calculated value of $K_2$:\n$K_3 = (1-0.1) \\times 90.5 + 0.5 \\times 10 = 0.9 \\times 90.5 + 5 = 81.45 + 5 = 86.45$.\nThe trajectory of the knowledge stock is $K_1 = 95$, $K_2 = 90.5$, and $K_3 = 86.45$.\n\nThe second task is to compute the trajectory of the unit cost $c_t$ for $t=1,2,3$.\nFor $t=1$:\n$c_1 = c_0 \\exp(-\\mu(K_1 - K_0))$\nSubstituting the values:\n$c_1 = 50 \\exp(-0.2(95 - 100)) = 50 \\exp(-0.2 \\times (-5)) = 50 \\exp(1) \\approx 135.91$.\n\nFor $t=2$:\n$c_2 = c_0 \\exp(-\\mu(K_2 - K_0))$\nSubstituting the values:\n$c_2 = 50 \\exp(-0.2(90.5 - 100)) = 50 \\exp(-0.2 \\times (-9.5)) = 50 \\exp(1.9) \\approx 334.30$.\n\nFor $t=3$:\n$c_3 = c_0 \\exp(-\\mu(K_3 - K_0))$\nSubstituting the values:\n$c_3 = 50 \\exp(-0.2(86.45 - 100)) = 50 \\exp(-0.2 \\times (-13.55)) = 50 \\exp(2.71)$.\n$c_3 \\approx 751.4451$.\n\nThe third task is for a brief interpretation.\nThe knowledge stock decreases over time because the R investment is insufficient to counteract the effect of depreciation. The condition for the knowledge stock to grow is $\\phi R_{t-1} > \\delta K_{t-1}$. For the first period, this would require $0.5 \\times 10 > 0.1 \\times 100$, or $5 > 10$, which is false. Since the R spending is constant while the stock is large, the stock continues to decay. This phenomenon is sometimes termed \"forgetting.\" The unit cost $c_t$ is inversely related to the knowledge stock. As the knowledge stock $K_t$ falls progressively further below the baseline $K_0$, the cost increases exponentially. This endogenous cost adjustment demonstrates that a sustained level of R is necessary simply to maintain a technology's cost-effectiveness, let alone improve it, in the presence of knowledge depreciation.\n\nFinally, we report the final-period unit cost $c_3$, rounded to four significant figures.\n$c_3 = 50 \\exp(2.71) \\approx 751.4451$.\nRounding to four significant figures gives $751.4$. Expressed in standard scientific notation, this is $7.514 \\times 10^2$.",

We proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe unit production cost is given by the function:\n$$\nc(t,Q) = a(t)\\,b(Q)\n$$\nThe elasticity of cost $c$ with respect to cumulative capacity $Q$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{c,Q} \\equiv \\frac{\\partial \\ln c(t,Q)}{\\partial \\ln Q}\n$$\nTo calculate this, we first take the natural logarithm of the cost function $c(t,Q)$:\n$$\n\\ln c(t,Q) = \\ln(a(t)\\,b(Q))\n$$\nUsing the property of logarithms that $\\ln(xy) = \\ln(x) + \\ln(y)$, we can separate the terms:\n$$\n\\ln c(t,Q) = \\ln(a(t)) + \\ln(b(Q))\n$$\nNow, we can substitute this expression into the definition of elasticity:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{c,Q} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\ln Q} \\left[ \\ln(a(t)) + \\ln(b(Q)) \\right]\n$$\nThe derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{c,Q} = \\frac{\\partial (\\ln a(t))}{\\partial \\ln Q} + \\frac{\\partial (\\ln b(Q))}{\\partial \\ln Q}\n$$\nThe first term, $\\frac{\\partial (\\ln a(t))}{\\partial \\ln Q}$, involves the partial derivative of a function of $t$ with respect to a variable related to $Q$. The problem states that the derivative is taken at a fixed time $t$. Furthermore, $a(t)$ is exogenous and does not depend on $Q$. Therefore, for the purpose of this partial differentiation, $\\ln(a(t))$ is treated as a constant, and its derivative with respect to $\\ln Q$ is zero.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial (\\ln a(t))}{\\partial \\ln Q} = 0\n$$\nThis simplifies the elasticity expression to:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{c,Q} = \\frac{\\partial (\\ln b(Q))}{\\partial \\ln Q}\n$$\nNext, we substitute the given form of the learning curve, $b(Q) = b_{0}\\left(\\frac{Q}{Q_{0}}\\right)^{-\\lambda}$:\n$$\n\\ln b(Q) = \\ln \\left( b_{0}\\left(\\frac{Q}{Q_{0}}\\right)^{-\\lambda} \\right)\n$$\nUsing the logarithm properties $\\ln(xy) = \\ln(x) + \\ln(y)$ and $\\ln(x^p) = p \\ln(x)$, we expand this expression:\n$$\n\\ln b(Q) = \\ln(b_{0}) + \\ln\\left(\\left(\\frac{Q}{Q_{0}}\\right)^{-\\lambda}\\right) = \\ln(b_{0}) - \\lambda \\ln\\left(\\frac{Q}{Q_{0}}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the property $\\ln(x/y) = \\ln(x) - \\ln(y)$, we further expand:\n$$\n\\ln b(Q) = \\ln(b_{0}) - \\lambda (\\ln Q - \\ln Q_{0}) = \\ln(b_{0}) - \\lambda \\ln Q + \\lambda \\ln Q_{0}\n$$\nNow we substitute this final form of $\\ln b(Q)$ back into the elasticity expression:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{c,Q} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\ln Q} \\left[ \\ln(b_{0}) - \\lambda \\ln Q + \\lambda \\ln Q_{0} \\right]\n$$\nThe terms $\\ln(b_{0})$ and $\\lambda \\ln Q_{0}$ are constants with respect to $Q$. Thus, their derivatives with respect to $\\ln Q$ are zero.\n$$\n\\epsilon_{c,Q} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\ln Q}(\\ln b_{0}) - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\ln Q}(\\lambda \\ln Q) + \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\ln Q}(\\lambda \\ln Q_{0})\n$$\n$$\n\\epsilon_{c,Q} = 0 - \\lambda \\frac{\\partial (\\ln Q)}{\\partial \\ln Q} + 0\n$$\nSince $\\frac{\\partial (\\ln Q)}{\\partial \\ln Q} = 1$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{c,Q} = -\\lambda\n$$\n\nThe elasticity of cost with respect to cumulative capacity is equal to the negative of the learning exponent, $\\lambda$. This result is constant and does not depend on time $t$ or cumulative capacity $Q$.\n\nAn interpretation of this result is that for a $1\\%$ increase in cumulative installed capacity $Q$, the unit production cost $c$ decreases by approximately $\\lambda\\%$. This provides a direct, quantitative measure of the impact of learning-by-doing. For policymakers designing deployment subsidies, this elasticity is a critical parameter. A higher value of $\\lambda$ implies that policies encouraging deployment (and thus increasing $Q$) will be more effective at driving down costs, potentially accelerating the point at which the technology becomes cost-competitive without support.\n\nAs shown in the derivation, the exogenous trend $a(t)$ does not affect this elasticity. The term $\\ln(a(t))$ vanishes during the partial differentiation with respect to $\\ln Q$ because $a(t)$ is assumed to be independent of $Q$. This means that while exogenous factors like RD spillovers or commodity price changes do affect the absolute cost level $c(t,Q)$, they do not alter the *rate of cost reduction achieved through deployment itself*. The elasticity $\\epsilon_{c,Q}$ isolates the pure effect of endogenous learning-by-doing.",

The stochastic parts are:\n$x_{stoch} = -k\\epsilon u + k w$\n$y_{stoch} = k u - k b w$\n\nThe variance of $x$ is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(x) = \\operatorname{Var}(-k\\epsilon u + k w) = (-k\\epsilon)^2 \\operatorname{Var}(u) + k^2 \\operatorname{Var}(w) = k^2 (\\epsilon^2 \\sigma_{u}^{2} + \\sigma_{w}^{2})\n$$\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(x) = \\frac{\\epsilon^2 \\sigma_{u}^{2} + \\sigma_{w}^{2}}{(1 - \\epsilon b)^2}\n$$\nThe covariance of $x$ and $y$ is:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cov}(x, y) = \\operatorname{Cov}(-k\\epsilon u + k w, k u - k b w)\n$$\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cov}(x, y) = (-k\\epsilon)(k) \\operatorname{Var}(u) + (k)(-kb) \\operatorname{Var}(w) = -k^2\\epsilon \\sigma_{u}^{2} - k^2 b \\sigma_{w}^{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cov}(x, y) = -k^2(\\epsilon \\sigma_{u}^{2} + b \\sigma_{w}^{2}) = -\\frac{\\epsilon \\sigma_{u}^{2} + b \\sigma_{w}^{2}}{(1 - \\epsilon b)^2}\n$$\nNow we compute the probability limit of the OLS slope estimator:\n$$\n\\operatorname{plim}(\\hat{\\beta}_1) = \\frac{\\operatorname{Cov}(x, y)}{\\operatorname{Var}(x)} = \\frac{-\\frac{\\epsilon \\sigma_{u}^{2} + b \\sigma_{w}^{2}}{(1 - \\epsilon b)^2}}{\\frac{\\epsilon^2 \\sigma_{u}^{2} + \\sigma_{w}^{2}}{(1 - \\epsilon b)^2}} = - \\frac{\\epsilon \\sigma_{u}^{2} + b \\sigma_{w}^{2}}{\\epsilon^2 \\sigma_{u}^{2} + \\sigma_{w}^{2}}\n$$\nThe asymptotic bias of the analyst's estimator for $b$ is:\n$$\n\\text{Asymptotic Bias}(\\hat{b}_{OLS}) = -\\operatorname{plim}(\\hat{\\beta}_1) - b\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Asymptotic Bias}(\\hat{b}_{OLS}) = \\left( \\frac{\\epsilon \\sigma_{u}^{2} + b \\sigma_{w}^{2}}{\\epsilon^2 \\sigma_{u}^{2} + \\sigma_{w}^{2}} \\right) - b\n$$\nTo simplify, find a common denominator:\n$$\n\\text{Asymptotic Bias} = \\frac{(\\epsilon \\sigma_{u}^{2} + b \\sigma_{w}^{2}) - b(\\epsilon^2 \\sigma_{u}^{2} + \\sigma_{w}^{2})}{\\epsilon^2 \\sigma_{u}^{2} + \\sigma_{w}^{2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Asymptotic Bias} = \\frac{\\epsilon \\sigma_{u}^{2} + b \\sigma_{w}^{2} - b\\epsilon^2 \\sigma_{u}^{2} - b \\sigma_{w}^{2}}{\\epsilon^2 \\sigma_{u}^{2} + \\sigma_{w}^{2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\text{Asymptotic Bias} = \\frac{\\epsilon \\sigma_{u}^{2} - b\\epsilon^2 \\sigma_{u}^{2}}{\\epsilon^2 \\sigma_{u}^{2} + \\sigma_{w}^{2}}\n$$\nFactoring out common terms in the numerator gives the final analytical expression for the asymptotic bias:\n$$\n\\text{Asymptotic Bias} = \\frac{\\epsilon \\sigma_{u}^{2} (1 - \\epsilon b)}{\\epsilon^2 \\sigma_{u}^{2} + \\sigma_{w}^{2}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values: $\\epsilon = 0.7$, $b = 0.2$, $\\sigma_{u}^{2} = 0.02$, and $\\sigma_{w}^{2} = 0.08$.\n\nFirst, check the stability condition: $1 - \\epsilon b = 1 - (0.7)(0.2) = 1 - 0.14 = 0.86$, which is positive as required.\n\nNext, compute the numerator and denominator of the bias expression.\nNumerator:\n$$\n\\epsilon \\sigma_{u}^{2} (1 - \\epsilon b) = (0.7)(0.02)(0.86) = (0.014)(0.86) = 0.01204\n$$\nDenominator:\n$$\n\\epsilon^2 \\sigma_{u}^{2} + \\sigma_{w}^{2} = (0.7)^2 (0.02) + 0.08 = (0.49)(0.02) + 0.08 = 0.0098 + 0.08 = 0.0898\n$$\nFinally, compute the bias:\n$$\n\\text{Asymptotic Bias} = \\frac{0.01204}{0.0898} \\approx 0.13407572...\n$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures, the numerical value of the asymptotic bias is $0.1341$.",
