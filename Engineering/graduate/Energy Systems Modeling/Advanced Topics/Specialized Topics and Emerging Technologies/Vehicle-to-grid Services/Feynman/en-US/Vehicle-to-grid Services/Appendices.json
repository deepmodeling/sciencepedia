            "problem": "An aggregator operates a fleet of Electric Vehicles (EVs) to provide Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) frequency regulation services. Consider a single EV with nominal battery capacity $C = 50$ kWh and a State of Charge (SOC) management policy that limits SOC to remain within a usable window from $10\\%$ to $90\\%$ of nominal capacity. The battery charge and discharge efficiencies are constant and equal, with $\\eta_{\\text{ch}} = \\eta_{\\text{dis}} = 0.95$. Assume:\n- The internal stored energy in the battery is $E_{\\text{batt}} = C \\cdot \\text{SOC}$.\n- When charging from the grid by an energy amount $E$ (measured at the grid side), the stored energy increases by $\\Delta E_{\\text{batt, ch}} = \\eta_{\\text{ch}} E$.\n- When discharging to the grid by an energy amount $E$ (measured at the grid side), the stored energy decreases by $\\Delta E_{\\text{batt, dis}} = E / \\eta_{\\text{dis}}$.\n\nThe aggregator seeks to commit to a symmetric one-hour regulation energy capability, meaning it can either absorb energy $+E$ from the grid or deliver energy $-E$ to the grid over a one-hour interval, with the same magnitude $E$ for both directions, starting from a chosen SOC setpoint $\\text{SOC}_{0}$ that is feasible within the policy window. The commitment must be such that, following either the full $+E$ charge or full $-E$ discharge for one hour, the battery’s SOC remains within the $10\\%$–$90\\%$ bounds.\n\nUsing first principles of energy accounting with efficiency and SOC constraints, determine the maximum symmetric regulation energy $E$ (in kWh) that can be sustained for one hour without violating SOC bounds, assuming the aggregator chooses the optimal $\\text{SOC}_{0}$ to maximize this symmetric capability.

            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a clear, self-contained set of definitions and constraints based on established principles of energy storage and vehicle-to-grid systems modeling. All necessary data are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or factual inaccuracies. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a formal solution can be derived.\n\nThe core of the problem is to find the maximum symmetric energy exchange $E$ at the grid connection point, which an Electric Vehicle (EV) can sustain for one hour, subject to its state of charge (SOC) limits. This requires finding an optimal initial SOC, denoted as $\\text{SOC}_{0}$, that maximizes this capability.\n\nFirst, we define the parameters and variables provided in the problem statement:\n- Nominal battery capacity: $C_n = 50$ kWh. We will use $C$ for this value.\n- Minimum allowed state of charge: $\\text{SOC}_{\\text{min}} = 0.10$ (or $10\\%$).\n- Maximum allowed state of charge: $\\text{SOC}_{\\text{max}} = 0.90$ (or $90\\%$).\n- Charging efficiency: $\\eta_{\\text{ch}} = 0.95$.\n- Discharging efficiency: $\\eta_{\\text{dis}} = 0.95$.\nSince the efficiencies are equal, we can define a single efficiency parameter $\\eta = \\eta_{\\text{ch}} = \\eta_{\\text{dis}} = 0.95$.\n\nThe internal stored energy in the battery, $E_{\\text{batt}}$, is related to the SOC by the equation $E_{\\text{batt}} = C \\cdot \\text{SOC}$. Thus, the allowed internal energy range is from $E_{\\text{batt,min}} = C \\cdot \\text{SOC}_{\\text{min}}$ to $E_{\\text{batt,max}} = C \\cdot \\text{SOC}_{\\text{max}}$.\nLet the initial state of charge be $\\text{SOC}_{0}$, corresponding to an initial internal energy $E_{\\text{batt},0} = C \\cdot \\text{SOC}_{0}$. For $\\text{SOC}_{0}$ to be a valid starting point, it must be within the allowed range: $\\text{SOC}_{\\text{min}} \\le \\text{SOC}_{0} \\le \\text{SOC}_{\\text{max}}$.\n\nWe analyze the two scenarios for the symmetric regulation service of energy magnitude $E$.\n\n1.  **Charging Scenario (absorbing energy $E$ from the grid):**\n    When an amount of energy $E$ is drawn from the grid, the energy stored in the battery increases by $\\Delta E_{\\text{batt, ch}} = \\eta_{\\text{ch}} E = \\eta E$.\n    The final internal energy of the battery after charging is $E_{\\text{batt,final,ch}} = E_{\\text{batt},0} + \\eta E$.\n    In terms of SOC, the final state of charge is $\\text{SOC}_{\\text{final,ch}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{batt,final,ch}}}{C} = \\frac{C \\cdot \\text{SOC}_{0} + \\eta E}{C} = \\text{SOC}_{0} + \\frac{\\eta E}{C}$.\n    This final SOC must not exceed the maximum limit:\n    $$ \\text{SOC}_{\\text{final,ch}} \\le \\text{SOC}_{\\text{max}} $$\n    $$ \\text{SOC}_{0} + \\frac{\\eta E}{C} \\le \\text{SOC}_{\\text{max}} $$\n    Rearranging to find the constraint on $E$:\n    $$ E \\le \\frac{C(\\text{SOC}_{\\text{max}} - \\text{SOC}_{0})}{\\eta} \\quad (1) $$\n\n2.  **Discharging Scenario (delivering energy $E$ to the grid):**\n    When an amount of energy $E$ is delivered to the grid, the energy drawn from the battery storage is $\\Delta E_{\\text{batt, dis}} = E / \\eta_{\\text{dis}} = E / \\eta$.\n    The final internal energy of the battery after discharging is $E_{\\text{batt,final,dis}} = E_{\\text{batt},0} - \\frac{E}{\\eta}$.\n    In terms of SOC, the final state of charge is $\\text{SOC}_{\\text{final,dis}} = \\frac{E_{\\text{batt,final,dis}}}{C} = \\frac{C \\cdot \\text{SOC}_{0} - E/\\eta}{C} = \\text{SOC}_{0} - \\frac{E}{C\\eta}$.\n    This final SOC must not fall below the minimum limit:\n    $$ \\text{SOC}_{\\text{final,dis}} \\ge \\text{SOC}_{\\text{min}} $$\n    $$ \\text{SOC}_{0} - \\frac{E}{C\\eta} \\ge \\text{SOC}_{\\text{min}} $$\n    Rearranging to find the constraint on $E$:\n    $$ E \\le C\\eta(\\text{SOC}_{0} - \\text{SOC}_{\\text{min}}) \\quad (2) $$\n\nTo guarantee that both charging and discharging by an amount $E$ are feasible from the initial state $\\text{SOC}_{0}$, $E$ must satisfy both inequalities $(1)$ and $(2)$. This means $E$ must be less than or equal to the minimum of the two upper bounds.\n$$ E \\le \\min \\left( \\frac{C(\\text{SOC}_{\\text{max}} - \\text{SOC}_{0})}{\\eta}, C\\eta(\\text{SOC}_{0} - \\text{SOC}_{\\text{min}}) \\right) $$\nThe aggregator wants to commit to the maximum possible symmetric energy $E$. We can achieve this by selecting the optimal initial SOC, $\\text{SOC}_{0}$, that maximizes the right-hand side of the above inequality. The maximum value of the minimum of two functions (one decreasing in $\\text{SOC}_{0}$, the other increasing) occurs when the two functions are equal. This balances the energy headroom for charging and discharging.\n$$ \\frac{C(\\text{SOC}_{\\text{max}} - \\text{SOC}_{0})}{\\eta} = C\\eta(\\text{SOC}_{0} - \\text{SOC}_{\\text{min}}) $$\nWe can cancel $C$ from both sides and solve for the optimal $\\text{SOC}_{0}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\text{SOC}_{\\text{max}} - \\text{SOC}_{0}}{\\eta} = \\eta(\\text{SOC}_{0} - \\text{SOC}_{\\text{min}}) $$\n$$ \\text{SOC}_{\\text{max}} - \\text{SOC}_{0} = \\eta^2(\\text{SOC}_{0} - \\text{SOC}_{\\text{min}}) $$\n$$ \\text{SOC}_{\\text{max}} - \\text{SOC}_{0} = \\eta^2\\text{SOC}_{0} - \\eta^2\\text{SOC}_{\\text{min}} $$\n$$ \\text{SOC}_{\\text{max}} + \\eta^2\\text{SOC}_{\\text{min}} = \\text{SOC}_{0}(1 + \\eta^2) $$\n$$ \\text{SOC}_{0, \\text{opt}} = \\frac{\\text{SOC}_{\\text{max}} + \\eta^2\\text{SOC}_{\\text{min}}}{1 + \\eta^2} $$\nNow, we substitute this optimal $\\text{SOC}_{0, \\text{opt}}$ back into either expression for $E$ to find the maximum possible symmetric energy, $E_{\\text{max}}$. Using expression $(2)$:\n$$ E_{\\text{max}} = C\\eta(\\text{SOC}_{0, \\text{opt}} - \\text{SOC}_{\\text{min}}) = C\\eta\\left(\\frac{\\text{SOC}_{\\text{max}} + \\eta^2\\text{SOC}_{\\text{min}}}{1 + \\eta^2} - \\text{SOC}_{\\text{min}}\\right) $$\n$$ E_{\\text{max}} = C\\eta\\left(\\frac{\\text{SOC}_{\\text{max}} + \\eta^2\\text{SOC}_{\\text{min}} - \\text{SOC}_{\\text{min}}(1 + \\eta^2)}{1 + \\eta^2}\\right) $$\n$$ E_{\\text{max}} = C\\eta\\left(\\frac{\\text{SOC}_{\\text{max}} + \\eta^2\\text{SOC}_{\\text{min}} - \\text{SOC}_{\\text{min}} - \\eta^2\\text{SOC}_{\\text{min}}}{1 + \\eta^2}\\right) $$\n$$ E_{\\text{max}} = C\\eta\\left(\\frac{\\text{SOC}_{\\text{max}} - \\text{SOC}_{\\text{min}}}{1 + \\eta^2}\\right) $$\nThis expression represents the maximum symmetric regulation energy.

The first four significant figures are $1$, $9$, $9$, and $7$. The fifth digit is $3$, so we round down.\n$$ E_{\\text{max}} \\approx 19.97 \\text{ kWh} $$\nThis is the maximum symmetric regulation energy that can be sustained for one hour without violating the SOC bounds.",

            "problem": "An aggregator coordinates a fleet of plug-in electric vehicles to provide Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) energy arbitrage in a wholesale market. The arbitrage strategy is to charge when price is low and discharge when price is high within the same day. Assume the following, which are consistent with basic conservation of energy and market accounting:\n\n- The round-trip efficiency is $\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}} = 0.9$, so that if $E_{\\mathrm{ch}}$ kilowatt-hours are purchased from the grid during charging, the discharged energy delivered to the grid is $E_{\\mathrm{dis}} = \\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}} E_{\\mathrm{ch}}$.\n- The aggregator pays a fixed per-cycle transaction cost of $f = 0.12$ United States Dollar (USD).\n- The aggregator pays a volumetric grid fee on charging of $g_{\\mathrm{in}} = 0.012$ USD per kilowatt-hour for energy purchased from the grid during charging. There is no volumetric fee on discharge.\n- Over a representative period, observed arbitrage cycles fall into two classes:\n  - Class A occurs with fraction $\\alpha = 0.6$ of cycles. Each Class A cycle discharges $E_{A} = 12$ kilowatt-hours to the grid at a high price $p_{h}^{A} = 0.24$ USD per kilowatt-hour, having been charged at a low price $p_{\\ell}^{A} = 0.07$ USD per kilowatt-hour earlier that day.\n  - Class B occurs with fraction $1-\\alpha = 0.4$ of cycles.

            "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of energy and economic modeling, well-posed with a complete and consistent set of data, and objective in its formulation. We can therefore proceed with a formal solution.\n\nOur objective is to find the breakeven degradation cost, $c_{\\mathrm{deg}}^{\\ast}$, which is the value of the degradation cost per kilowatt-hour of discharged energy that makes the expected profit of the arbitrage operation equal to zero. We begin by defining the profit for a single arbitrage cycle.\n\nLet $\\pi$ be the profit for one cycle. The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.\nThe revenue, $R$, is generated by discharging an amount of energy $E_{\\mathrm{dis}}$ to the grid at a high price $p_h$:\n$$R = E_{\\mathrm{dis}} p_h$$\nThe total cost, $C$, is the sum of several components:\n1.  The cost of purchasing energy, $C_e$. To discharge $E_{\\mathrm{dis}}$, an amount of energy $E_{\\mathrm{ch}}$ must be charged from the grid at a low price $p_{\\ell}$. The relationship between charged and discharged energy is given by the round-trip efficiency $\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}$: $E_{\\mathrm{dis}} = \\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}} E_{\\mathrm{ch}}$. Therefore, $E_{\\mathrm{ch}} = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{dis}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}}$. The cost of energy is then:\n    $$C_e = E_{\\mathrm{ch}} p_{\\ell} = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{dis}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}} p_{\\ell}$$\n2.  The volumetric grid fee, $C_g$, which is applied to the energy purchased from the grid:\n    $$C_g = E_{\\mathrm{ch}} g_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{dis}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}} g_{\\mathrm{in}}$$\n3.  The battery degradation cost, $C_d$, which is proportional to the discharged energy throughput with a rate $c_{\\mathrm{deg}}$:\n    $$C_d = E_{\\mathrm{dis}} c_{\\mathrm{deg}}$$\n4.  The fixed per-cycle transaction cost, $f$.\n\nThe total cost for a single cycle is $C = C_e + C_g + C_d + f$. The profit, $\\pi = R-C$, is therefore:\n$$\\pi = E_{\\mathrm{dis}} p_h - \\left( \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{dis}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}} p_{\\ell} + \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{dis}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}} g_{\\mathrm{in}} + E_{\\mathrm{dis}} c_{\\mathrm{deg}} + f \\right)$$\nFactoring out $E_{\\mathrm{dis}}$ from the variable cost terms, we get:\n$$\\pi = E_{\\mathrm{dis}} \\left( p_h - \\frac{p_{\\ell} + g_{\\mathrm{in}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}} - c_{\\mathrm{deg}} \\right) - f$$\n\nThe problem describes two classes of cycles, A and B, occurring with fractions $\\alpha$ and $1-\\alpha$ respectively. We can write the profit for each class:\nFor Class A:\n$$\\pi_A = E_{A} \\left( p_{h}^{A} - \\frac{p_{\\ell}^{A} + g_{\\mathrm{in}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}} - c_{\\mathrm{deg}} \\right) - f$$\nFor Class B:\n$$\\pi_B = E_{B} \\left( p_{h}^{B} - \\frac{p_{\\ell}^{B} + g_{\\mathrm{in}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}} - c_{\\mathrm{deg}} \\right) - f$$\n\nThe expected profit, $E[\\pi]$, is the weighted average of the profits from these two classes:\n$$E[\\pi] = \\alpha \\pi_A + (1-\\alpha) \\pi_B$$\nThe breakeven condition requires that the expected profit is zero, $E[\\pi]=0$, when the degradation cost is $c_{\\mathrm{deg}}^{\\ast}$.\n$$0 = \\alpha \\left[ E_{A} \\left( p_{h}^{A} - \\frac{p_{\\ell}^{A} + g_{\\mathrm{in}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}} - c_{\\mathrm{deg}}^{\\ast} \\right) - f \\right] + (1-\\alpha) \\left[ E_{B} \\left( p_{h}^{B} - \\frac{p_{\\ell}^{B} + g_{\\mathrm{in}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}} - c_{\\mathrm{deg}}^{\\ast} \\right) - f \\right]$$\nWe must now solve for $c_{\\mathrm{deg}}^{\\ast}$. Let's expand and rearrange the equation, isolating the terms containing $c_{\\mathrm{deg}}^{\\ast}$:\n$$0 = \\alpha \\left[ E_{A} \\left( p_{h}^{A} - \\frac{p_{\\ell}^{A} + g_{\\mathrm{in}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}} \\right) - f \\right] - \\alpha E_A c_{\\mathrm{deg}}^{\\ast} + (1-\\alpha) \\left[ E_{B} \\left( p_{h}^{B} - \\frac{p_{\\ell}^{B} + g_{\\mathrm{in}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}} \\right) - f \\right] - (1-\\alpha) E_B c_{\\mathrm{deg}}^{\\ast}$$\nCombining the fixed cost terms $- \\alpha f - (1-\\alpha)f = -(\\alpha + 1 - \\alpha)f = -f$, and moving the $c_{\\mathrm{deg}}^{\\ast}$ terms to the left side:\n$$c_{\\mathrm{deg}}^{\\ast}(\\alpha E_A + (1-\\alpha) E_B) = \\alpha E_A \\left( p_{h}^{A} - \\frac{p_{\\ell}^{A} + g_{\\mathrm{in}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}} \\right) + (1-\\alpha) E_B \\left( p_{h}^{B} - \\frac{p_{\\ell}^{B} + g_{\\mathrm{in}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}} \\right) - f$$\nThe term $\\alpha E_A + (1-\\alpha) E_B$ is the expected discharged energy per cycle, $E[E_{\\mathrm{dis}}]$. The right-hand side of the equation represents the expected profit per cycle *before* accounting for degradation cost. Dividing by the expected discharged energy gives the breakeven cost per unit of discharged energy:\n$$c_{\\mathrm{deg}}^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\alpha E_A \\left( p_{h}^{A} - \\frac{p_{\\ell}^{A} + g_{\\mathrm{in}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}} \\right) + (1-\\alpha) E_B \\left( p_{h}^{B} - \\frac{p_{\\ell}^{B} + g_{\\mathrm{in}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}} \\right) - f}{\\alpha E_A + (1-\\alpha) E_B}$$\nThis is the derived analytical expression for the breakeven degradation cost.\n\nNow, we substitute the given numerical values:\n$\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}} = 0.9$\n$f = 0.12$ USD\n$g_{\\mathrm{in}} = 0.012$ USD/kWh\n$\\alpha = 0.6$\n$E_{A} = 12$ kWh, $p_{h}^{A} = 0.24$ USD/kWh, $p_{\\ell}^{A} = 0.07$ USD/kWh\n$E_{B} = 8$ kWh, $p_{h}^{B} = 0.19$ USD/kWh, $p_{\\ell}^{B} = 0.06$ USD/kWh\n\nFirst, calculate the denominator, which is the expected discharged energy per cycle, $E[E_{\\mathrm{dis}}]$:\n$$E[E_{\\mathrm{dis}}] = \\alpha E_A + (1-\\alpha) E_B = (0.6)(12) + (0.4)(8) = 7.2 + 3.2 = 10.4 \\, \\text{kWh}$$\nNext, we calculate the terms in the numerator.\nFor Class A, the effective cost of delivered energy is $\\frac{p_{\\ell}^{A} + g_{\\mathrm{in}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}} = \\frac{0.07 + 0.012}{0.9} = \\frac{0.082}{0.9}$ USD/kWh.\nThe gross margin for Class A (before fixed cost and degradation) is:\n$$E_A \\left( p_{h}^{A} - \\frac{p_{\\ell}^{A} + g_{\\mathrm{in}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}} \\right) = 12 \\left( 0.24 - \\frac{0.082}{0.9} \\right) \\approx 12(0.24 - 0.09111...) = 12(0.14888...) = 1.78666... \\, \\text{USD}$$\nFor Class B, the effective cost of delivered energy is $\\frac{p_{\\ell}^{B} + g_{\\mathrm{in}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}} = \\frac{0.06 + 0.012}{0.9} = \\frac{0.072}{0.9} = 0.08$ USD/kWh.\nThe gross margin for Class B is:\n$$E_B \\left( p_{h}^{B} - \\frac{p_{\\ell}^{B} + g_{\\mathrm{in}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}} \\right) = 8 \\left( 0.19 - 0.08 \\right) = 8(0.11) = 0.88 \\, \\text{USD}$$\nNow, we compute the numerator, which is the expected gross margin minus the fixed cost:\n$$\\text{Numerator} = (0.6)(1.78666...) + (0.4)(0.88) - 0.12 = 1.072 + 0.352 - 0.12 = 1.304 \\, \\text{USD}$$\nFinally, we compute the breakeven degradation cost $c_{\\mathrm{deg}}^{\\ast}$:\n$$c_{\\mathrm{deg}}^{\\ast} = \\frac{1.304}{10.4} \\approx 0.1253846... \\, \\text{USD/kWh}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $c_{\\mathrm{deg}}^{\\ast} = 0.1254$ USD/kWh.\n\nThe breakeven degradation cost, $c_{\\mathrm{deg}}^{\\ast}$, represents the maximum allowable cost of battery wear per kilowatt-hour of energy discharged for the V2G arbitrage operation to be economically viable on average. If the actual degradation cost is higher than this value, the aggregator will lose money; if it is lower, the aggregator will make a profit.\n\nThis value is a crucial parameter for designing V2G participation strategies. Specifically, an aggregator should only dispatch a vehicle for an arbitrage cycle if the expected profit from that cycle can cover the vehicle's specific degradation cost. The value $c_{\\mathrm{deg}}^{\\ast}$ represents the average available margin (per kWh) to cover this degradation cost. Therefore, vehicles with an estimated degradation cost higher than this value are not profitable candidates for this specific arbitrage service mix. This breakeven cost serves as a dynamic participation threshold that should be continuously updated based on market prices.\n\nRegarding tariff structures, $c_{\\mathrm{deg}}^{\\ast}$ sets an upper bound on what the aggregator can afford to pay vehicle owners as compensation for using their battery. The aggregator's profit margin is the difference between this breakeven value and the sum of the actual degradation cost and the tariff paid to the EV owner. For a sustainable business model, the aggregator must design tariffs (e.g., per-kWh payments to owners) that are attractive enough to incentivize participation but low enough to leave a positive profit margin. The breakeven value quantifies the total financial \"space\" available per kWh to be shared between covering the physical cost of battery wear and generating profit for both the aggregator and the vehicle owner.",

Since $r > 0$, we have $\\sigma_E = r \\sigma_D$.\nSo, the distribution of the trip energy is $E_{\\text{trip}} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(r \\mu_D, (r \\sigma_D)^2)$.\n\nThe SOC reservation policy $\\theta$ is a dimensionless fraction representing the minimum portion of the battery capacity that must be reserved. The corresponding amount of reserved energy, $E_{\\text{res}}$, is given by:\n$$E_{\\text{res}} = \\theta \\cdot C_{\\text{bat}}$$\n\nThe core requirement of the policy is that the probability of the reserved energy being sufficient for the trip is at least $0.95$. This can be expressed as a probability statement:\n$$P(E_{\\text{res}} \\ge E_{\\text{trip}}) \\ge 0.95$$\nThis is equivalent to:\n$$P(E_{\\text{trip}} \\le E_{\\text{res}}) \\ge 0.95$$\nTo find the minimum SOC reservation $\\theta$, we must find the minimum $E_{\\text{res}}$ that satisfies this condition. This occurs when the probability is exactly equal to the threshold:\n$$P(E_{\\text{trip}} \\le E_{\\text{res}}) = 0.95$$\nThis statement defines $E_{\\text{res}}$ as the $0.95$-quantile (or the $95^{th}$ percentile) of the distribution of $E_{\\text{trip}}$.\n\nTo find this value, we can standardize the random variable $E_{\\text{trip}}$. Let $Z$ be a standard normal random variable, $Z \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$. The standardization is $Z = \\frac{E_{\\text{trip}} - \\mu_E}{\\sigma_E}$. The probability statement becomes:\n$$P\\left(\\frac{E_{\\text{trip}} - \\mu_E}{\\sigma_E} \\le \\frac{E_{\\text{res}} - \\mu_E}{\\sigma_E}\\right) = 0.95$$\n$$P\\left(Z \\le \\frac{E_{\\text{res}} - \\mu_E}{\\sigma_E}\\right) = 0.95$$\nLet $z_{0.95}$ denote the $0.95$-quantile of the standard normal distribution, which is the value such that $P(Z \\le z_{0.95}) = 0.95$. We then have the equality:\n$$\\frac{E_{\\text{res}} - \\mu_E}{\\sigma_E} = z_{0.95}$$\nSolving for $E_{\\text{res}}$, we obtain:\n$$E_{\\text{res}} = \\mu_E + z_{0.95} \\cdot \\sigma_E$$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $\\mu_E$ and $\\sigma_E$:\n$$E_{\\text{res}} = (r \\cdot \\mu_D) + z_{0.95} \\cdot (r \\cdot \\sigma_D)$$\nWe can factor out the consumption rate $r$:\n$$E_{\\text{res}} = r(\\mu_D + z_{0.95} \\sigma_D)$$\nFinally, we relate this back to the SOC policy $\\theta$ using $E_{\\text{res}} = \\theta \\cdot C_{\\text{bat}}$:\n$$\\theta \\cdot C_{\\text{bat}} = r(\\mu_D + z_{0.95} \\sigma_D)$$\nSolving for $\\theta$ gives the explicit expression for the minimum SOC reservation policy:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{r(\\mu_D + z_{0.95} \\sigma_D)}{C_{\\text{bat}}}$$\nThis is the general formula for $\\theta$ as a function of the given parameters.\n\nWe now evaluate this expression numerically using the provided values:\n$\\mu_D = 30\\,\\text{km}$\n$\\sigma_D = 10\\,\\text{km}$\n$r = 0.18\\,\\text{kWh/km}$\n$C_{\\text{bat}} = 60\\,\\text{kWh}$\nThe value of the $0.95$-quantile of the standard normal distribution is $z_{0.95} \\approx 1.64485$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the required energy reservation, $E_{\\text{res}}$:\n$$E_{\\text{res}} = 0.18 \\cdot (30 + 1.64485 \\cdot 10) = 0.18 \\cdot (30 + 16.4485)$$\n$$E_{\\text{res}} = 0.18 \\cdot 46.4485 = 8.36073\\,\\text{kWh}$$\nNext, we calculate the SOC reservation $\\theta$:\n$$\\theta = \\frac{E_{\\text{res}}}{C_{\\text{bat}}} = \\frac{8.36073}{60}$$\n$$\\theta \\approx 0.1393455$$\nThe problem requires the final numeric answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\theta \\approx 0.1393$$\nThus, the minimum SOC that must be reserved is approximately $13.93\\%$ of the total battery capacity.",
