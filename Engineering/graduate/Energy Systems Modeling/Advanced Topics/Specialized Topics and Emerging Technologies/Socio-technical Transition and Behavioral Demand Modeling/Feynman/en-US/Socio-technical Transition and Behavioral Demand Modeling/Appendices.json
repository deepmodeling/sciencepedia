Let $F(t)$ denote the cumulative fraction of the market that has adopted by time $t$, where $0 \\leq F(t) \\leq 1$, and let $M$ be the total market potential (a fixed population).

It presents a standard application of the Bass diffusion model, a scientifically grounded and well-established mathematical framework used in socio-technical systems analysis. The problem is well-posed, with all necessary parameters ($p$, $q$, $M$), an initial condition ($F(0)=0$), and a clear objective. The provided values are physically consistent and realistic. The problem requires a standard calculus-based optimization of a function derived from a differential equation, which is a mathematically sound procedure.\n\nThe objective is to find the time $t^{\\ast}$ at which the absolute adoption rate, $X(t)$, reaches its maximum, and to determine the value of this maximum rate, $X(t^{\\ast})$. The adoption rate is given by\n$$\nX(t) = M\\,\\frac{dF}{dt}\n$$\nwhere $M$ is the constant market potential. To maximize $X(t)$, we must maximize the fractional adoption rate, $\\frac{dF}{dt}$. The Bass model provides the form of this rate as a function of the cumulative adoption fraction $F(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dF}{dt} = \\left(p + q\\,F(t)\\right)\\left(1 - F(t)\\right)\n$$\nFor simplicity, let $F \\equiv F(t)$ and let the function to be maximized be $g(F) = (p + qF)(1 - F)$. We find the value of $F$ that maximizes $g(F)$ by taking the derivative with respect to $F$ and setting it to zero. First, expand $g(F)$:\n$$\ng(F) = p - pF + qF - qF^2 = -qF^2 + (q-p)F + p\n$$\nThis is a quadratic function of $F$, representing a downward-opening parabola since $q  0$. The maximum occurs at the vertex. The derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{dg}{dF} = -2qF + (q-p)\n$$\nSetting the derivative to zero gives the value of $F$, denoted $F^{\\ast}$, at which the rate is maximal:\n$$\n-2qF^{\\ast} + q - p = 0 \\implies 2qF^{\\ast} = q-p \\implies F^{\\ast} = \\frac{q-p}{2q}\n$$\nThe second derivative, $\\frac{d^2g}{dF^2} = -2q$, is negative, confirming a maximum.\n\nTo find the time $t^{\\ast}$ when this occurs, we must solve the original differential equation for $F(t)$ and then find the time $t$ for which $F(t) = F^{\\ast}$.

The context provided, while rich, serves to situate a formalizable mathematical problem within a relevant scientific field.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Functional Form of $C(Q)$\nWe are given the constant elasticity relationship:\n$$\nE_{C,Q} = \\frac{d \\ln C}{d \\ln Q} = -\\lambda\n$$\nTo find the function $C(Q)$, we integrate this differential equation. Let $u = \\ln Q$ and $v = \\ln C$. The equation becomes $\\frac{dv}{du} = -\\lambda$. Integrating with respect to $u$ yields:\n$$\n\\int dv = \\int -\\lambda \\, du\n$$\n$$\nv = -\\lambda u + K\n$$\nwhere $K$ is the constant of integration. Substituting back the original variables:\n$$\n\\ln C(Q) = -\\lambda \\ln Q + K\n$$\nUsing the property of logarithms, $-\\lambda \\ln Q = \\ln(Q^{-\\lambda})$, we have:\n$$\n\\ln C(Q) = \\ln(Q^{-\\lambda}) + K\n$$\nTo solve for $C(Q)$, we exponentiate both sides of the equation:\n$$\nC(Q) = \\exp(\\ln(Q^{-\\lambda}) + K) = \\exp(\\ln(Q^{-\\lambda})) \\cdot \\exp(K)\n$$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$\nC(Q) = Q^{-\\lambda} \\cdot A\n$$\nwhere $A = \\exp(K)$ is a new constant. We use the boundary condition $C(1) = C_{0}$ to determine $A$:\n$$\nC(1) = A \\cdot (1)^{-\\lambda} = A \\cdot 1 = A\n$$\nThus, the constant $A$ is equal to the initial cost $C_{0}$. The functional form for the unit cost is:\n$$\nC(Q) = C_{0} Q^{-\\lambda}\n$$\nThis is the standard mathematical form of the experience curve.\n\n### Derivation of the Learning Rate (LR)\nThe learning rate is defined as the fractional reduction in cost for a doubling of cumulative production:\n$$\n\\text{LR} = 1 - \\frac{C(2Q)}{C(Q)}\n$$\nWe substitute the derived function $C(Q) = C_{0} Q^{-\\lambda}$ into this definition. The cost at a production level of $2Q$ is:\n$$\nC(2Q) = C_{0} (2Q)^{-\\lambda} = C_{0} 2^{-\\lambda} Q^{-\\lambda}\n$$\nThe ratio $\\frac{C(2Q)}{C(Q)}$ is then:\n$$\n\\frac{C(2Q)}{C(Q)} = \\frac{C_{0} 2^{-\\lambda} Q^{-\\lambda}}{C_{0} Q^{-\\lambda}} = 2^{-\\lambda}\n$$\nThis ratio is independent of the production level $Q$, which is a direct consequence of the constant elasticity assumption. Substituting this result back into the definition of the learning rate gives the closed-form expression:\n$$\n\\text{LR} = 1 - 2^{-\\lambda}\n$$\n\n### Computation of $C(8)$ and LR\nWe are given the parameters $C_{0}=100$, $\\lambda=0.2$, and we are asked to find the cost at $Q=8$.\n\nFirst, we compute the learning rate $\\text{LR}$:\n$$\n\\text{LR} = 1 - 2^{-\\lambda} = 1 - 2^{-0.2}\n$$\nCalculating the value:\n$$\n2^{-0.2} \\approx 0.87055056...\n$$\n$$\n\\text{LR} = 1 - 0.87055056... = 0.12944943...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the learning rate is $\\text{LR} \\approx 0.1294$.\n\nNext, we compute the unit cost $C(8)$:\n$$\nC(Q) = C_{0} Q^{-\\lambda}\n$$\n$$\nC(8) = 100 \\cdot 8^{-0.2}\n$$\nWe can simplify the term $8^{-0.2}$ by recognizing that $8 = 2^3$:\n$$\n8^{-0.2} = (2^3)^{-0.2} = 2^{3 \\times (-0.2)} = 2^{-0.6}\n$$\nCalculating the value:\n$$\n2^{-0.6} \\approx 0.65975395...\n$$\nSo, the unit cost is:\n$$\nC(8) = 100 \\times 0.65975395... = 65.975395...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the unit cost is $C(8) \\approx 65.98$.
