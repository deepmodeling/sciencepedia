            "problem": "Consider a capacity expansion planning problem for a single peak hour formulated as a Two-Stage Stochastic Program (TSSP). In the first stage, the planner chooses a firm capacity $x$ (in megawatts). The first-stage investment cost is $k x$ (in dollars per hour), where $k>0$ is a given amortized capacity cost rate. In the second stage, after the uncertainty is revealed, the operator dispatches up to $x$ from the new capacity and can additionally procure energy from a spot market subject to a tranche limit. Any unmet demand results in load shedding penalized by a piecewise linear Value of Lost Load (VOLL) function. The second-stage for each scenario $s \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$ is modeled by a Linear Programming (LP) recourse problem with decision variables $g_s$ (dispatch from the new capacity), $p_s$ (spot market purchase), $u_{1,s}$ (first VOLL segment of shed load), and $u_{2,s}$ (second VOLL segment of shed load), and parameters described below. The energy balance constraint is $g_s + p_s + u_{1,s} + u_{2,s} = d_s$, and the operational limits are $0 \\leq g_s \\leq x$, $0 \\leq p_s \\leq b$, $0 \\leq u_{1,s} \\leq r$, and $u_{2,s} \\geq 0$. The second-stage cost in scenario $s$ is $c_m p_s + v_1 u_{1,s} + v_2 u_{2,s}$, where $c_m$, $v_1$, and $v_2$ are positive constants with $c_m < v_1 < v_2$. The planner’s objective is to minimize the sum of the first-stage investment cost and the probability-weighted expected second-stage operating cost.\n\nThe parameters are:\n- Scenario demands are $d_1 = 50$, $d_2 = 80$, $d_3 = 110$ (in megawatts).\n- Scenario probabilities are $\\pi_1 = 0.4$, $\\pi_2 = 0.35$, $\\pi_3 = 0.25$.\n- Spot market tranche limit is $b = 30$ (in megawatts).\n- VOLL first-segment limit is $r = 10$ (in megawatts).\n- Spot market price is $c_m = 150$ (in dollars per megawatt-hour).\n- VOLL first-segment penalty is $v_1 = 2000$ (in dollars per megawatt-hour).\n- VOLL second-segment penalty is $v_2 = 10000$ (in dollars per megawatt-hour).\n- Amortized capacity cost rate is $k = 500$ (in dollars per megawatt per hour).\n\nAssume a single hour is considered, so megawatt and megawatt-hour units coincide for costs per hour. The dispatch $g_s$ has no variable operating cost in the second stage (its cost is fully captured by the first-stage term $k x$), and there are no other operational constraints.\n\nStarting from the formal definition of a TSSP and the LP recourse model described above, derive the expected recourse cost as a function of $x$ using first principles. Then, determine the optimal capacity $x$ that minimizes the total expected cost $k x + \\sum_{s=1}^{3} \\pi_s \\left(c_m p_s + v_1 u_{1,s} + v_2 u_{2,s}\\right)$ subject to the recourse feasibility constraints, and compute the associated expected total cost at this optimal $x$.\n\nProvide exact values.

In the second stage, once uncertainty is revealed, the system is operated to meet scenario-dependent demand $d_s$ (in $\\mathrm{MW}$), incurring a variable operating cost $v$ per unit of energy produced (in $\\mathrm{MWh}$) and, if capacity is insufficient, a shortage penalty $L$ per unit of unmet demand (in $\\mathrm{MWh}$). The operation cost in scenario $s$ for a chosen capacity $y$ is modeled as $v \\cdot \\min\\{y, d_s\\} + L \\cdot \\max\\{0, d_s - y\\}$, which is a widely used convex recourse function capturing dispatch up to capacity and a linear penalty on unmet demand. The total cost in scenario $s$ is therefore $f y + v \\cdot \\min\\{y, d_s\\} + L \\cdot \\max\\{0, d_s - y\\}$.\n\nThere are three demand scenarios $s \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$ with probabilities $p_1 = 0.2$, $p_2 = 0.5$, and $p_3 = 0.3$.

Assume the representative hour scaling so that $\\mathrm{MW}$ and $\\mathrm{MWh}$ coincide over the hour.\n\nThe Stochastic Programming (SP) solution is defined as the first-stage capacity $y^{\\mathrm{SP}}$ that minimizes the expected total cost under the given scenario distribution. The Expected Value (EV) solution is defined by first replacing the uncertain demand with its expectation $\\mathbb{E}[d]$, solving the resulting deterministic problem to obtain $y^{\\mathrm{EV}}$, and then evaluating the expected cost of implementing $y^{\\mathrm{EV}}$ under the original stochastic environment.

To find the minimum, we analyze the derivative of $C(y)$. The derivative of the recourse function $Q(y, d_s) = v \\cdot \\min\\{y, d_s\\} + L \\cdot \\max\\{0, d_s - y\\}$ is $v-L$ if $y < d_s$ and $0$ if $y > d_s$.

We can substitute this into the objective to get a problem in $x$ only:\n$$ \\min_{x \\geq 0} F(x) = 100x + \\max(0, 26000 - 144x) $$\nThis is a convex function. The derivative for small $x$ is $F'(x) = 100 - 144 = -44$, and for large $x$ is $F'(x)=100$. The minimum is at the \"kink\" where the derivative changes sign, which occurs when $26000 - 144x = 0$.\nSolving for $x$ gives the new trial solution:\n$$ x^{(1)} = \\frac{26000}{144} = \\frac{1625}{9} \\approx 180.56 $$\nAt this point, the corresponding $\\theta$ value is:\n$$ \\theta^{(1)} = \\max\\left(0, 26000 - 144 \\cdot \\frac{1625}{9}\\right) = 0 $$\nThe updated master optimal objective value is:\n$$ c x^{(1)} + \\theta^{(1)} = 100 \\left(\\frac{1625}{9}\\right) + 0 = \\frac{162500}{9} \\approx 18055.56 $$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $18060$. This value is the new lower bound on the optimal solution to the original stochastic program.",
