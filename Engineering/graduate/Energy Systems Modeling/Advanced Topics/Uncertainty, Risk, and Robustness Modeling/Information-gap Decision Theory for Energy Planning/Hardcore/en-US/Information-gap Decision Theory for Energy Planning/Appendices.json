            "solution": "The problem requires the computation of the robustness function $\\hat{\\alpha}(d)$ from Information-Gap Decision Theory (IGDT), followed by a diagnosis of the situation and the proposal of a remedy. The robustness function for a decision $d$ is defined as the maximum horizon of uncertainty $\\alpha$ for which a required performance constraint is met. The definition is:\n$$\n\\hat{\\alpha}(d) = \\sup\\big\\{\\, \\alpha \\geq 0 \\;:\\; \\max_{u \\in \\mathcal{U}(\\alpha)} L(d,u) \\leq \\bar{L} \\,\\big\\}\n$$\nThe primary task is to evaluate the constraint inside the supremum: $\\max_{u \\in \\mathcal{U}(\\alpha)} L(d,u) \\leq \\bar{L}$. To find the maximum of the Loss-of-Load Probability (LOLP) function, $L(d,u)$, over the uncertainty set $\\mathcal{U}(\\alpha)$, we first analyze the behavior of $L(d,u)$ with respect to the uncertain parameter $u$. The function is given as:\n$$\nL(d,u) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(\\beta (d - u))}\n$$\nTo determine if the function is monotonic in $u$, we compute its partial derivative with respect to $u$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial u} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u} \\left[ (1 + \\exp(\\beta(d-u)))^{-1} \\right]\n$$\nUsing the chain rule, this becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial u} = -1 \\cdot (1 + \\exp(\\beta(d-u)))^{-2} \\cdot \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial u} (\\exp(\\beta(d-u))) = - (1 + \\exp(\\beta(d-u)))^{-2} \\cdot \\exp(\\beta(d-u)) \\cdot (-\\beta)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial u} = \\frac{\\beta \\exp(\\beta(d-u))}{(1 + \\exp(\\beta(d-u)))^2}\n$$\nGiven that the steepness parameter $\\beta > 0$ and the exponential function is always positive, the derivative $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial u}$ is strictly positive for all values of its arguments. This proves that $L(d,u)$ is a monotonically increasing function of the peak demand $u$. Therefore, a higher peak demand $u$ invariably leads to a higher Loss-of-Load Probability.\n\nThe uncertainty in $u$ is modeled by the interval $\\mathcal{U}(\\alpha) = [\\,\\tilde{u}(1-\\alpha),\\, \\tilde{u}(1+\\alpha)\\,]$. Because $L(d,u)$ is monotonically increasing in $u$, its maximum value over this interval will be attained at the interval's upper bound, where $u$ is at its maximum possible value:\n$$\nu_{\\max} = \\tilde{u}(1+\\alpha)\n$$\nConsequently, the constraint defining the robustness simplifies to evaluating the LOLP function at this worst-case demand:\n$$\nL(d, u_{\\max}) \\leq \\bar{L} \\quad \\implies \\quad L(d, \\tilde{u}(1+\\alpha)) \\leq \\bar{L}\n$$\nFor the robustness $\\hat{\\alpha}(d)$ to be greater than zero, this inequality must hold for some range of $\\alpha > 0$. A necessary condition for this is that the inequality must hold for the base case where there is no uncertainty, i.e., at $\\alpha=0$. When $\\alpha=0$, the uncertainty set collapses to the single point estimate, $\\mathcal{U}(0) = \\{\\tilde{u}\\}$, and the performance requirement becomes:\n$$\nL(d, \\tilde{u}) \\leq \\bar{L}\n$$\nWe must now test this condition with the provided data: $d = 10 \\ \\mathrm{GW}$, $\\tilde{u} = 9.5 \\ \\mathrm{GW}$, $\\beta = 5$, and $\\bar{L} = 0.05$. We calculate the nominal LOLP, $L(10, 9.5)$:\n$$\nL(10, 9.5) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(5 \\cdot (10 - 9.5))} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(5 \\cdot 0.5)} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(2.5)}\n$$\nThe value of $\\exp(2.5)$ is approximately $12.1825$. Substituting this gives:\n$$\nL(10, 9.5) \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + 12.1825} = \\frac{1}{13.1825} \\approx 0.075859\n$$\nWe now compare the calculated nominal LOLP with the required tolerance $\\bar{L}$:\n$$\n0.075859 > 0.05\n$$\nThe condition $L(d, \\tilde{u}) \\leq \\bar{L}$ is violated. The power system, with the proposed capacity $d=10 \\ \\mathrm{GW}$, fails to meet the reliability requirement even when the peak demand is exactly at its baseline estimate $\\tilde{u}$.\n\nSince $L(d, \\tilde{u}(1+\\alpha))$ is an increasing function of $\\alpha$ (because $u_{\\max}$ increases with $\\alpha$), and the condition fails for $\\alpha=0$, it will necessarily fail for all $\\alpha > 0$. This means the set of non-negative values of $\\alpha$ for which the reliability requirement is met, $\\{\\, \\alpha \\geq 0 \\;:\\; \\max_{u \\in \\mathcal{U}(\\alpha)} L(d,u) \\leq \\bar{L} \\,\\}$, is the empty set. By convention in IGDT, the supremum of an empty set of non-negative numbers is $0$.\nTherefore, the robustness of this decision is $\\hat{\\alpha}(d) = 0$.\n\nThe diagnosis of the situation is straightforward: the planned capacity of $d=10 \\ \\mathrm{GW}$ is inadequate for the system's reliability targets. It fails to perform acceptably even under the nominal, best-estimate conditions, before any uncertainty is even considered. The system has zero robustness to any unforeseen increase in peak demand because it is already failing in the nominal scenario.\n\nTo achieve a positive robustness, $\\hat{\\alpha}(d) > 0$, the system parameters must be adjusted such that the nominal performance is acceptable, i.e., $L(d, \\tilde{u}) < \\bar{L}$. The most direct quantitative remedy is to increase the installed capacity $d$. We can compute the minimum critical capacity, $d_{\\text{crit}}$, required to exactly meet the nominal target: $L(d_{\\text{crit}}, \\tilde{u}) = \\bar{L}$.\n$$\n\\frac{1}{1 + \\exp(\\beta(d_{\\text{crit}} - \\tilde{u}))} = \\bar{L}\n$$\nSolving for $d_{\\text{crit}}$:\n$$\n1 + \\exp(\\beta(d_{\\text{crit}} - \\tilde{u})) = \\frac{1}{\\bar{L}} \\implies \\exp(\\beta(d_{\\text{crit}} - \\tilde{u})) = \\frac{1}{\\bar{L}} - 1 = \\frac{1-\\bar{L}}{\\bar{L}}\n$$\n$$\nd_{\\text{crit}} = \\tilde{u} + \\frac{1}{\\beta} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1-\\bar{L}}{\\bar{L}}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$\nd_{\\text{crit}} = 9.5 + \\frac{1}{5} \\ln\\left(\\frac{1 - 0.05}{0.05}\\right) = 9.5 + 0.2 \\ln\\left(19\\right)\n$$\nUsing $\\ln(19) \\approx 2.9444$, we find:\n$$\nd_{\\text{crit}} \\approx 9.5 + 0.2 \\cdot 2.9444 = 9.5 + 0.58888 = 10.08888 \\ \\mathrm{GW}\n$$\nTherefore, a specific quantitative remedy is to increase the installed capacity to any value greater than $10.08888 \\ \\mathrm{GW}$, for instance, setting $d = 10.1 \\ \\mathrm{GW}$. This action would ensure that $L(10.1, 9.5) < 0.05$, which in turn guarantees that $\\hat{\\alpha}(10.1) > 0$.",

The expected cost, $F(k) = \\mathbb{E}[C(k,D)]$, is:\n$$\nF(k) = p_1 C(k, D_1) + p_2 C(k, D_2)\n$$\nThis is a piecewise linear, convex function. Its minimum will occur at one of the demand values, $60$ or $140$. We analyze the slope of $F(k)$ in the intervals defined by these points.\n\nCase 1: $k < 60$. Here, $k < D_1$ and $k < D_2$.\n$$\nF(k) = p_1 ((r+g-\\lambda)k + \\lambda D_1) + p_2 ((r+g-\\lambda)k + \\lambda D_2) = (r+g-\\lambda)k + \\lambda(p_1 D_1 + p_2 D_2)\n$$\nThe slope is $\\frac{dF}{dk} = r+g-\\lambda = 50 + 20 - 200 = -130$.

The slope is $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial D} = 200$.\n\nSince the slope with respect to $D$ is always positive, the cost function $C(60,D)$ is monotonically increasing in $D$. Therefore, the worst-case cost over the uncertainty interval $\\mathcal{U}(\\alpha)$ occurs at the maximum possible demand, $D_{\\max} = 100(1+\\alpha)$.\n\nFor any $\\alpha \\ge 0$, we have $D_{\\max} \\ge 100$, which is greater than $k_E = 60$.
