            "problem": "A regional power system authority is defining two decarbonization pathways over a horizon of $10$ years. Pathway $\\mathrm{A}$ front-loads investment in firm low-carbon capacity with a smaller reinvestment near the end of the horizon. Pathway $\\mathrm{B}$ defers some investment and relies on mid-horizon retrofits followed by a larger upgrade at the end of the horizon. All costs are real (inflation-adjusted), deterministic, and expressed in the same currency. The authority adopts standard time-preference discounting with a constant real discount rate $r$ per year. The Net Present Cost (NPC) is defined by the standard discounting formula\n$$\nNPC \\;=\\; \\sum_{t} \\frac{C_{t}}{(1+r)^{t}},\n$$\nwhere $C_{t}$ is the undiscounted cost at year $t$.\n\nThe cost streams for the two pathways are:\n- Pathway $\\mathrm{A}$: an immediate capital expenditure of $C^{\\mathrm{A}}_{0} = 2.0 \\times 10^{9}$ at year $0$, and a reinvestment of $C^{\\mathrm{A}}_{10} = 1.5 \\times 10^{9}$ at year $10$.\n- Pathway $\\mathrm{B}$: a retrofit expenditure of $C^{\\mathrm{B}}_{5} = 3.0 \\times 10^{9}$ at year $5$, and an upgrade of $C^{\\mathrm{B}}_{10} = 2.5 \\times 10^{9}$ at year $10$.\n\nStarting from the definition of discounting and the Net Present Cost, derive expressions for $NPC_{\\mathrm{A}}(r)$ and $NPC_{\\mathrm{B}}(r)$ as functions of $r$, and then determine the threshold discount rate $r^{\\star}$ (expressed as a decimal per year) at which $NPC_{\\mathrm{A}}(r^{\\star}) = NPC_{\\mathrm{B}}(r^{\\star})$.

Let $x = \\frac{1}{(1+r^{\\star})^{5}}$. Consequently, $x^{2} = \\left(\\frac{1}{(1+r^{\\star})^{5}}\\right)^{2} = \\frac{1}{(1+r^{\\star})^{10}}$.\nSubstituting $x$ into the equation gives:\n$$\n2.0 + 1.5 x^{2} = 3.0 x + 2.5 x^{2}\n$$\nRearranging the terms yields a standard quadratic equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$:\n$$\n(2.5 - 1.5)x^{2} + 3.0 x - 2.0 = 0\n$$\n$$\n1.0 x^{2} + 3.0 x - 2.0 = 0\n$$\nWe solve for $x$ using the quadratic formula, $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}$:\n$$\nx = \\frac{-3.0 \\pm \\sqrt{(3.0)^{2} - 4(1.0)(-2.0)}}{2(1.0)}\n$$\n$$\nx = \\frac{-3.0 \\pm \\sqrt{9.0 + 8.0}}{2}\n$$\n$$\nx = \\frac{-3.0 \\pm \\sqrt{17}}{2}\n$$\nSince $r$ is a real discount rate, we expect $r > -1$, and in most economic contexts, $r \\ge 0$. This implies $1+r^{\\star} > 0$. Therefore, $x = (1+r^{\\star})^{-5}$ must be a positive real number. The root $x = \\frac{-3.0 - \\sqrt{17}}{2}$ is negative and thus is not a physically meaningful solution. We must select the positive root:\n$$\nx = \\frac{-3.0 + \\sqrt{17}}{2}\n$$\nNow, we substitute back $x = \\frac{1}{(1+r^{\\star})^{5}}$ to solve for $r^{\\star}$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{(1+r^{\\star})^{5}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{17} - 3}{2}\n$$\nInverting both sides gives:\n$$\n(1+r^{\\star})^{5} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{17} - 3}\n$$\nTaking the fifth root of both sides:\n$$\n1+r^{\\star} = \\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{17} - 3}\\right)^{1/5}\n$$\nFinally, isolating $r^{\\star}$ yields the closed-form analytic expression:\n$$\nr^{\\star} = \\left(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{17} - 3}\\right)^{1/5} - 1\n$$\n\nFor the qualitative explanation, we analyze the structure of the $NPC$ functions. The discount rate $r$ determines the present value of future costs. A higher $r$ diminishes the value of future costs more significantly.\nPathway $\\mathrm{A}$ has a substantial immediate cost ($C^{\\mathrm{A}}_{0}$), which is not discounted. Pathway $\\mathrm{B}$ defers all costs to the future ($t=5$ and $t=10$).\n- When the discount rate $r$ is low (approaching $0$), future costs are nearly as significant as present costs. In this case, the decision is dominated by the total undiscounted capital expenditure. Total cost for $\\mathrm{A}$ is $C^{\\mathrm{A}}_{0} + C^{\\mathrm{A}}_{10} = (2.0 + 1.5) \\times 10^{9} = 3.5 \\times 10^{9}$. Total cost for $\\mathrm{B}$ is $C^{\\mathrm{B}}_{5} + C^{\\mathrm{B}}_{10} = (3.0 + 2.5) \\times 10^{9} = 5.5 \\times 10^{9}$. Since Total Cost($\\mathrm{A}$) < Total Cost($\\mathrm{B}$), for low $r$, $NPC_{\\mathrm{A}} < NPC_{\\mathrm{B}}$, making Pathway $\\mathrm{A}$ the preferred option.\n- When the discount rate $r$ is high, future costs are heavily discounted and contribute much less to the $NPC$. The decision is dominated by the near-term costs. Pathway $\\mathrm{A}$ has a large upfront cost $C^{\\mathrm{A}}_{0} = 2.0 \\times 10^{9}$, whereas Pathway $\\mathrm{B}$ has zero cost at $t=0$. This large, undiscounted cost makes Pathway $\\mathrm{A}$ very expensive at high $r$. Therefore, for high $r$, $NPC_{\\mathrm{B}} < NPC_{\\mathrm{A}}$, making Pathway $\\mathrm{B}$ the preferred option.\n\nThe threshold $r^{\\star}$ is the specific rate where the financial advantage of Pathway $\\mathrm{B}$'s deferred spending is perfectly offset by its higher total expenditure. Thus, for any $r < r^{\\star}$, Pathway $\\mathrm{A}$ is preferred, while for any $r > r^{\\star}$, Pathway $\\mathrm{B}$ is preferred.",

The problem requires the derivation of a closed-form expression for final energy demand, $E(t)$, and its evaluation at a specific time point.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in several steps, starting from the fundamental growth laws for Gross Domestic Product ($GDP$) and Population ($P$).\n\nFirst, we solve for $GDP(t)$. The governing differential equation is given as:\n$$ \\frac{d\\,GDP(t)}{dt} = g(t)\\,GDP(t) $$\nwhere the growth rate $g(t)$ is $g(t) = g_{0}\\exp(-\\alpha t) + g_{\\infty}$.\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation, which can be solved by separation of variables:\n$$ \\frac{d\\,GDP(t)}{GDP(t)} = g(t) dt $$\nIntegrating both sides from the initial time $t=0$ to a general time $t$:\n$$ \\int_{GDP(0)}^{GDP(t)} \\frac{dGDP'}{GDP'} = \\int_{0}^{t} g(\\tau) d\\tau $$\n$$ \\ln(GDP(t)) - \\ln(GDP(0)) = \\int_{0}^{t} (g_{0}\\exp(-\\alpha \\tau) + g_{\\infty}) d\\tau $$\nLetting $GDP(0) = GDP_{0}$, we evaluate the integral:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{GDP(t)}{GDP_{0}}\\right) = \\left[ -\\frac{g_{0}}{\\alpha}\\exp(-\\alpha \\tau) + g_{\\infty}\\tau \\right]_{0}^{t} $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{GDP(t)}{GDP_{0}}\\right) = \\left(-\\frac{g_{0}}{\\alpha}\\exp(-\\alpha t) + g_{\\infty}t\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{g_{0}}{\\alpha}\\exp(0) + 0\\right) = \\frac{g_{0}}{\\alpha}(1 - \\exp(-\\alpha t)) + g_{\\infty}t $$\nExponentiating both sides yields the expression for $GDP(t)$:\n$$ GDP(t) = GDP_{0} \\exp\\left( \\frac{g_{0}}{\\alpha}(1 - \\exp(-\\alpha t)) + g_{\\infty}t \\right) $$\nSecond, we solve for the population, $P(t)$. The governing equation is:\n$$ \\frac{d\\,P(t)}{dt} = h\\,P(t) $$\nwhere $h$ is a constant growth rate. This is the standard model for exponential growth. With the initial condition $P(0) = P_{0}$, the solution is:\n$$ P(t) = P_{0} \\exp(ht) $$\nThird, we define the income per capita, $y(t)$, as the ratio of $GDP(t)$ to $P(t)$:\n$$ y(t) = \\frac{GDP(t)}{P(t)} = \\frac{GDP_{0}}{P_{0}} \\frac{\\exp\\left( \\frac{g_{0}}{\\alpha}(1 - \\exp(-\\alpha t)) + g_{\\infty}t \\right)}{\\exp(ht)} $$\nDefining the initial income per capita as $y(0) = y_{0} = \\frac{GDP_{0}}{P_{0}}$, we can write the relative income per capita growth as:\n$$ \\frac{y(t)}{y_{0}} = \\exp\\left( \\frac{g_{0}}{\\alpha}(1 - \\exp(-\\alpha t)) + (g_{\\infty} - h)t \\right) $$\nFourth, we use the definition of the elasticity of final energy demand, $\\epsilon$, to find $E(t)$. The definition is:\n$$ \\epsilon = \\frac{\\partial \\ln E(t)}{\\partial \\ln y(t)} $$\nAssuming $\\epsilon$ is constant, we can treat this as an ordinary differential equation and integrate:\n$$ d\\ln E = \\epsilon \\, d\\ln y $$\n$$ \\int_{\\ln E_{0}}^{\\ln E(t)} d(\\ln E') = \\epsilon \\int_{\\ln y_{0}}^{\\ln y(t)} d(\\ln y') $$\n$$ \\ln E(t) - \\ln E_{0} = \\epsilon (\\ln y(t) - \\ln y_{0}) $$\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{E(t)}{E_{0}}\\right) = \\epsilon \\ln\\left(\\frac{y(t)}{y_{0}}\\right) = \\ln\\left( \\left(\\frac{y(t)}{y_{0}}\\right)^{\\epsilon} \\right) $$\nExponentiating both sides gives the relationship between energy and income:\n$$ E(t) = E_{0} \\left( \\frac{y(t)}{y_{0}} \\right)^{\\epsilon} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\frac{y(t)}{y_{0}}$, we arrive at the final closed-form expression for $E(t)$:\n$$ E(t) = E_{0} \\left[ \\exp\\left( \\frac{g_{0}}{\\alpha}(1 - \\exp(-\\alpha t)) + (g_{\\infty} - h)t \\right) \\right]^{\\epsilon} $$\n$$ E(t) = E_{0} \\exp\\left( \\epsilon \\left[ \\frac{g_{0}}{\\alpha}(1 - \\exp(-\\alpha t)) + (g_{\\infty} - h)t \\right] \\right) $$\nThis expression gives $E(t)$ as a function of the required parameters.\n\nThe problem also asks for a brief justification of how $\\epsilon$ can be estimated from historical data. The definition $\\epsilon = \\frac{\\partial \\ln E}{\\partial \\ln y}$ implies that for small changes, $\\Delta \\ln E \\approx \\epsilon \\Delta \\ln y$. Integrating this relationship under the assumption that $\\epsilon$ is a constant yields a log-log functional form: $\\ln E = C + \\epsilon \\ln y$, where $C$ is a constant of integration. To estimate $\\epsilon$ from a historical time series of energy demand ($E_t$) and income per capita ($y_t$), an analyst would typically specify a linear regression model based on this log-log relationship:\n$$ \\ln(E_{t}) = \\beta_{0} + \\epsilon \\ln(y_{t}) + \\sum_{k} \\gamma_{k} Z_{kt} + u_{t} $$\nIn this model, the coefficient $\\epsilon$ directly estimates the income elasticity. The term $\\sum_{k} \\gamma_{k} Z_{kt}$ represents a set of control variables (the \"confounders\" mentioned in the problem, such as energy prices, technological progress, or policy variables) that also influence energy demand. Including these controls is crucial for isolating the net effect of income on energy, thereby yielding a less biased and more reliable estimate for $\\epsilon$ using methods like Ordinary Least Squares (OLS).\n\nFinally, we evaluate $E(t)$ for $t=30$ years (year $2050$) using the provided parameter values:\n$E_{0} = 400\\,\\text{EJ}$\n$\\epsilon = 0.60$\n$g_{0} = 0.02$\n$\\alpha = 0.05\\,\\text{yr}^{-1}$\n$g_{\\infty} = 0.01$\n$h = 0.007\\,\\text{yr}^{-1}$\n$t = 30\\,\\text{yr}$\n\nWe calculate the terms in the exponent:\nThe term $\\frac{g_{0}}{\\alpha} = \\frac{0.02}{0.05} = 0.4$.\nThe term $\\alpha t = 0.05 \\times 30 = 1.5$.\nThe term $g_{\\infty} - h = 0.01 - 0.007 = 0.003$.\nThe term $(g_{\\infty} - h)t = 0.003 \\times 30 = 0.09$.\n\nThe full argument of the exponential function is:\n$$ \\epsilon \\left[ \\frac{g_{0}}{\\alpha}(1 - \\exp(-\\alpha t)) + (g_{\\infty} - h)t \\right] = 0.60 \\left[ 0.4(1 - \\exp(-1.5)) + 0.09 \\right] $$\n$$ = 0.60 \\left[ 0.4(1 - 0.223130...) + 0.09 \\right] $$\n$$ = 0.60 \\left[ 0.4(0.776870...) + 0.09 \\right] $$\n$$ = 0.60 \\left[ 0.310748... + 0.09 \\right] $$\n$$ = 0.60 [0.400748...] = 0.240449... $$\nNow we compute $E(30)$:\n$$ E(30) = 400 \\times \\exp(0.240449...) $$\n$$ E(30) = 400 \\times 1.271817... = 508.727... $$\nRounding the result to $4$ significant figures, we get $508.7\\,\\text{EJ}$.",

Let this fully decorrelated and standardized vector be $\\mathbf{p}'$. Then $\\mathbf{p}' = \\mathbf{\\Lambda}^{-1/2}\\mathbf{p} = \\mathbf{\\Lambda}^{-1/2}\\mathbf{V}^T\\mathbf{z}$. The appropriate distance in this transformed space is the standard Euclidean distance. The squared separation $d^2$ is then:\n$$\nd^2 = (\\mathbf{p}')^T \\mathbf{p}' = (\\mathbf{\\Lambda}^{-1/2}\\mathbf{V}^T\\mathbf{z})^T (\\mathbf{\\Lambda}^{-1/2}\\mathbf{V}^T\\mathbf{z}) = \\mathbf{z}^T \\mathbf{V} \\mathbf{\\Lambda}^{-1/2} \\mathbf{\\Lambda}^{-1/2} \\mathbf{V}^T \\mathbf{z} = \\mathbf{z}^T \\mathbf{V} \\mathbf{\\Lambda}^{-1} \\mathbf{V}^T \\mathbf{z}\n$$\nRecognizing that the inverse of the correlation matrix is $\\mathbf{R}^{-1} = (\\mathbf{V}\\mathbf{\\Lambda}\\mathbf{V}^T)^{-1} = \\mathbf{V}\\mathbf{\\Lambda}^{-1}\\mathbf{V}^T$, the expression for the squared separation simplifies to:\n$$\nd^2 = \\mathbf{z}^T \\mathbf{R}^{-1} \\mathbf{z}\n$$\nThis is the squared Mahalanobis distance of the standardized difference vector. It is the required composite separation metric. It correctly generalizes the Euclidean distance to account for correlations. If $\\mathbf{R}=\\mathbf{I}$, then $\\mathbf{R}^{-1}=\\mathbf{I}$, and $d^2=\\mathbf{z}^T\\mathbf{I}\\mathbf{z}=\\mathbf{z}^T\\mathbf{z}$, satisfying the first condition. It explicitly uses the correlation information via $\\mathbf{R}^{-1}$, satisfying the second condition.\n\nNow, we compute the value. First, we must find the inverse of $\\mathbf{R}$. The determinant of $\\mathbf{R}$ is:\n$$\n\\det(\\mathbf{R}) = 1(1 \\cdot 1 - 0 \\cdot 0) - 0 + 0.5(0 \\cdot 0 - 1 \\cdot 0.5) = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75\n$$\nThe inverse is $\\mathbf{R}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{\\det(\\mathbf{R})} \\text{adj}(\\mathbf{R})$. The adjugate matrix, adj($\\mathbf{R}$), is the transpose of the cofactor matrix.\nThe cofactor matrix $\\mathbf{C}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{C} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & -0.5 \\\\\n0 & 1 - (0.5)^2 & 0 \\\\\n-0.5 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix}\n1 & 0 & -0.5 \\\\\n0 & 0.75 & 0 \\\\\n-0.5 & 0 & 1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSince $\\mathbf{C}$ is symmetric, $\\text{adj}(\\mathbf{R}) = \\mathbf{C}^T = \\mathbf{C}$.\n$$\n\\mathbf{R}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{0.75} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & -0.5 \\\\ 0 & 0.75 & 0 \\\\ -0.5 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{4}{3} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & -0.5 \\\\ 0 & 0.75 & 0 \\\\ -0.5 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4/3 & 0 & -2/3 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -2/3 & 0 & 4/3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we compute the squared separation $d^2 = \\mathbf{z}^T \\mathbf{R}^{-1} \\mathbf{z}$ with $\\mathbf{z} = (-1.2, 0.5, -0.5)^T$:\n$$\nd^2 = \\begin{pmatrix} -1.2 & 0.5 & -0.5 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 4/3 & 0 & -2/3 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -2/3 & 0 & 4/3 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -1.2 \\\\ 0.5 \\\\ -0.5 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nExpanding the quadratic form:\n$$\nd^2 = (R^{-1})_{11}z_E^2 + (R^{-1})_{22}z_C^2 + (R^{-1})_{33}z_D^2 + 2(R^{-1})_{13}z_E z_D\n$$\n$$\nd^2 = \\frac{4}{3}(-1.2)^2 + 1(0.5)^2 + \\frac{4}{3}(-0.5)^2 + 2\\left(-\\frac{2}{3}\\right)(-1.2)(-0.5)\n$$\n$$\nd^2 = \\frac{4}{3}(1.44) + 0.25 + \\frac{4}{3}(0.25) - \\frac{4}{3}(0.6)\n$$\n$$\nd^2 = 1.92 + 0.25 + \\frac{1}{3} - 0.8\n$$\nTo maintain precision, we use fractions: $-1.2 = -6/5$, $0.5 = 1/2$, $-0.5 = -1/2$.\n$$\nd^2 = \\frac{4}{3}\\left(-\\frac{6}{5}\\right)^2 + 1\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\frac{4}{3}\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + 2\\left(-\\frac{2}{3}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{6}{5}\\right)\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nd^2 = \\frac{4}{3}\\left(\\frac{36}{25}\\right) + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{4}{3}\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right) - \\frac{4}{3}\\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nd^2 = \\frac{4 \\cdot 12}{25} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{4}{5}\n$$\n$$\nd^2 = \\frac{48}{25} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{3} - \\frac{4}{5}\n$$\nThe least common multiple of the denominators $25$, $4$, $3$, $5$ is $300$.\n$$\nd^2 = \\frac{48 \\cdot 12}{300} + \\frac{1 \\cdot 75}{300} + \\frac{1 \\cdot 100}{300} - \\frac{4 \\cdot 60}{300}\n$$\n$$\nd^2 = \\frac{576}{300} + \\frac{75}{300} + \\frac{100}{300} - \\frac{240}{300}\n$$\n$$\nd^2 = \\frac{576 + 75 + 100 - 240}{300} = \\frac{751 - 240}{300} = \\frac{511}{300}\n$$\nThe composite separation is $d = \\sqrt{d^2}$:\n$$\nd = \\sqrt{\\frac{511}{300}} \\approx \\sqrt{1.70333...} \\approx 1.305118\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, the final value is $1.305$.",
