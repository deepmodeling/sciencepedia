            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of engineering economics, well-posed with all necessary information provided, and objective in its language. The problem requires the derivation of a standard financial formula from first principles, which is a substantive and appropriate task.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the uniform equivalent annual capital charge, $A$, in terms of the initial capital investment $K$, the real discount rate $r$, and the operating horizon of $n$ years. The derivation is based on the principle that the net present value (NPV) of the series of annual payments $A$ must equal the initial investment $K$.\n\nThe present value ($PV$) of a single future payment $F_t$ made at the end of year $t$ is given by the formula for discrete compounding:\n$$PV = \\frac{F_t}{(1+r)^t}$$\nIn this problem, a uniform payment $A$ is made at the end of each year $t$ for $t \\in \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$. The present value of the payment made in year $t$, denoted as $PV_t$, is:\n$$PV_t = \\frac{A}{(1+r)^t}$$\nThe total present value of this entire stream of $n$ annual payments is the sum of the individual present values. This must be equal to the upfront capital investment $K$.\n$$K = PV_1 + PV_2 + \\dots + PV_n$$\n$$K = \\sum_{t=1}^{n} PV_t = \\sum_{t=1}^{n} \\frac{A}{(1+r)^t}$$\nSince $A$ is a constant value for all years, it can be factored out of the summation:\n$$K = A \\sum_{t=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{(1+r)^t}$$\nThe summation term is a finite geometric series. Let us define a variable $x = \\frac{1}{1+r}$. The series can be written as:\n$$\\sum_{t=1}^{n} x^t = x^1 + x^2 + \\dots + x^n$$\nThe sum of a finite geometric series $\\sum_{k=1}^{n} ar^{k-1}$ is $a\\frac{1-r^n}{1-r}$. In our case, the first term is $x$ and the common ratio is also $x$. The sum is therefore:\n$$\\sum_{t=1}^{n} x^t = x \\frac{1-x^n}{1-x}$$\nSubstituting $x = \\frac{1}{1+r}$ back into the components of this formula:\n$$1-x = 1 - \\frac{1}{1+r} = \\frac{1+r-1}{1+r} = \\frac{r}{1+r}$$\nThus, the sum of the series is:\n$$\\sum_{t=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{(1+r)^t} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{1+r} \\left( 1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+r}\\right)^n \\right)}{\\frac{r}{1+r}} = \\frac{1 - (1+r)^{-n}}{r}$$\nNow, we substitute this result back into the equation for $K$:\n$$K = A \\left[ \\frac{1 - (1+r)^{-n}}{r} \\right]$$\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the Capital Recovery Factor (CRF), which is defined as the ratio $A/K$. Rearranging the above equation gives the CRF:\n$$\\text{CRF} = \\frac{A}{K} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1 - (1+r)^{-n}}{r}} = \\frac{r}{1 - (1+r)^{-n}}$$\nThis can also be expressed by multiplying the numerator and denominator by $(1+r)^n$:\n$$\\text{CRF} = \\frac{r(1+r)^n}{(1+r)^n - 1}$$\nFinally, to express the annualized capital cost $A$ in terms of $K$, $r$, and $n$, we solve the equation for $A$:\n$$A = K \\left[ \\frac{r}{1 - (1+r)^{-n}} \\right]$$\nThis expression represents the uniform annual payment required over $n$ years to recover the initial capital investment $K$ at a discount rate of $r$.",

Proceeding to the solution.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe problem requires us to determine the shadow price of the capacity constraint on refinery $R_1$ and use it to evaluate an expansion decision.\n\n**1. Calculate Unit Production Costs for Each Refinery**\n\nThe problem states that each refinery sources from the farm that provides the lowest cost per liter of ethanol. The cost is given by $c_{i \\to j}^{(\\text{L})} = \\frac{c_{F_i} + t_{F_i,R_j}}{y_j} + k_j$.\n\n*   **For Refinery $R_1$ ($y_1=320\\,\\text{L/t}$, $k_1=0.12\\,\\$/\\text{L}$):**\n    *   Sourcing from Farm $F_1$:\n        $$c_{1 \\to 1}^{(\\text{L})} = \\frac{c_{F_1} + t_{F_1,R_1}}{y_1} + k_1 = \\frac{35\\,\\$/\\text{t} + 6\\,\\$/\\text{t}}{320\\,\\text{L/t}} + 0.12\\,\\$/\\text{L} = \\frac{41}{320}\\,\\$/\\text{L} + 0.12\\,\\$/\\text{L} = 0.128125\\,\\$/\\text{L} + 0.12\\,\\$/\\text{L} = 0.248125\\,\\$/\\text{L}$$\n    *   Sourcing from Farm $F_2$:\n        $$c_{2 \\to 1}^{(\\text{L})} = \\frac{c_{F_2} + t_{F_2,R_1}}{y_1} + k_1 = \\frac{45\\,\\$/\\text{t} + 10\\,\\$/\\text{t}}{320\\,\\text{L/t}} + 0.12\\,\\$/\\text{L} = \\frac{55}{320}\\,\\$/\\text{L} + 0.12\\,\\$/\\text{L} = 0.171875\\,\\$/\\text{L} + 0.12\\,\\$/\\text{L} = 0.291875\\,\\$/\\text{L}$$\n    Comparing the two, $0.248125 < 0.291875$. Therefore, $R_1$ will source exclusively from $F_1$, and its effective unit production cost is $C_1 = 0.248125\\,\\$/\\text{L}$.\n\n*   **For Refinery $R_2$ ($y_2=300\\,\\text{L/t}$, $k_2=0.15\\,\\$/\\text{L}$):**\n    *   Sourcing from Farm $F_1$:\n        $$c_{1 \\to 2}^{(\\text{L})} = \\frac{c_{F_1} + t_{F_1,R_2}}{y_2} + k_2 = \\frac{35\\,\\$/\\text{t} + 12\\,\\$/\\text{t}}{300\\,\\text{L/t}} + 0.15\\,\\$/\\text{L} \\approx 0.156667\\,\\$/\\text{L} + 0.15\\,\\$/\\text{L} = 0.306667\\,\\$/\\text{L}$$\n    *   Sourcing from Farm $F_2$:\n        $$c_{2 \\to 2}^{(\\text{L})} = \\frac{c_{F_2} + t_{F_2,R_2}}{y_2} + k_2 = \\frac{45\\,\\$/\\text{t} + 5\\,\\$/\\text{t}}{300\\,\\text{L/t}} + 0.15\\,\\$/\\text{L} \\approx 0.166667\\,\\$/\\text{L} + 0.15\\,\\$/\\text{L} = 0.316667\\,\\$/\\text{L}$$\n    Comparing the two, $0.306667 < 0.316667$. Therefore, $R_2$ will also source exclusively from $F_1$, and its effective unit production cost is $C_2 = \\frac{47}{300} + 0.15 = \\frac{47+45}{300} = \\frac{92}{300} = \\frac{23}{75} \\approx 0.306667\\,\\$/\\text{L}$.\n\n**2. Formulate and Solve the Linear Program**\n\nThe objective is to minimize total cost $Z = C_1 q_1 + C_2 q_2$.\n$$ \\text{Minimize} \\quad Z = 0.248125 q_1 + \\frac{23}{75} q_2 $$\nSubject to:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nq_1 + q_2 &\\ge 120,000,000 && \\text{(Demand)} \\\\\nq_1 &\\le 100,000,000 && \\text{(Capacity } R_1\\text{)} \\\\\nq_1, q_2 &\\ge 0\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nWe have calculated the unit costs $C_1 = 0.248125\\,\\$/\\text{L}$ and $C_2 \\approx 0.306667\\,\\$/\\text{L}$. Since $C_1 < C_2$, it is economically optimal to produce as much as possible at the cheaper refinery, $R_1$. The capacity of $R_1$ limits its production to $q_1 = K_1 = 100,000,000\\,\\text{L}$.\n\nTo meet the total demand of $D = 120,000,000\\,\\text{L}$, the remaining amount must be produced by $R_2$:\n$$ q_2 = D - q_1 = 120,000,000 - 100,000,000 = 20,000,000\\,\\text{L} $$\nThe optimal production plan is $q_1^* = 100,000,000\\,\\text{L}$ and $q_2^* = 20,000,000\\,\\text{L}$. At this solution, both the demand constraint ($100+20=120$) and the capacity constraint on $R_1$ are active (binding).\n\n**3. Compute the Shadow Price of the Capacity Constraint**\n\nThe shadow price of a constraint is the marginal change in the optimal objective function value for a unit relaxation of that constraint's right-hand-side (RHS). The constraint is $q_1 \\le K_1$. We are interested in the effect of increasing $K_1$.\n\nLet's consider an infinitesimal increase in capacity, $dK_1$. Because $C_1 < C_2$, it remains optimal to use this new capacity at $R_1$. The new production at $R_1$ will be $q_1 = K_1 + dK_1$. To maintain the demand balance $q_1 + q_2 = D$, the production at $R_2$ must decrease by the same amount: $q_2 = (D - K_1) - dK_1$.\nThe change in production is $dq_1 = dK_1$ and $dq_2 = -dK_1$.\n\nThe change in total cost, $dZ$, is:\n$$ dZ = C_1 dq_1 + C_2 dq_2 = C_1(dK_1) + C_2(-dK_1) = (C_1 - C_2)dK_1 $$\nThe shadow price is defined as the marginal *improvement* (decrease) in cost per unit increase in $K_1$. Mathematically, this is $-\\frac{dZ}{dK_1}$.\n$$ \\text{Shadow Price} = -\\frac{dZ}{dK_1} = -(C_1 - C_2) = C_2 - C_1 $$\nThis result is intuitive: for every extra liter of capacity at the cheaper refinery $R_1$, we can shift one liter of production from the more expensive refinery $R_2$, saving the difference in their unit costs.\n\nNow, we calculate the numerical value:\n$$ \\text{Shadow Price} = C_2 - C_1 = \\frac{23}{75}\\,\\$/\\text{L} - 0.248125\\,\\$/\\text{L} \\approx 0.306667\\,\\$/\\text{L} - 0.248125\\,\\$/\\text{L} = 0.05854166... \\,\\$/\\text{L} $$\nRounding to five decimal places, the shadow price is $0.05854\\,\\$/\\text{L}$.\n\n**4. Economic Interpretation**\n\nThe shadow price of $0.05854\\,\\$/\\text{L}$ represents the marginal economic benefit, or cost saving, for each additional liter of annual production capacity at refinery $R_1$. The marginal cost to add this capacity is given as $\\gamma = 0.050\\,\\$/\\text{L}$.\n\nTo determine if expansion is justified, we compare the marginal benefit (shadow price) to the marginal cost ($\\gamma$):\n$$ \\text{Marginal Benefit} = 0.05854\\,\\$/\\text{L} $$\n$$ \\text{Marginal Cost} = 0.050\\,\\$/\\text{L} $$\nSince Marginal Benefit > Marginal Cost ($0.05854 > 0.050$), the savings from using the new capacity are greater than the cost of creating it. Therefore, at the margin, a small expansion of $R_1$'s capacity is economically justified.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. The shadow price of $R_1$ capacity is $0.05854\\,\\$/\\text{L}$; because $0.05854 > \\gamma = 0.050$, an infinitesimal expansion of $K_1$ is economically justified at the margin.**\nThis option states the shadow price is $0.05854\\,\\$/\\text{L}$, which matches our calculated value of $C_2 - C_1$. It correctly compares this value to the marginal expansion cost $\\gamma = 0.050\\,\\$/\\text{L}$ and draws the correct economic conclusion that expansion is justified because the benefit exceeds the cost.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The shadow price of $R_1$ capacity is $-0.05854\\,\\$/\\text{L}$; because it is negative, expanding $K_1$ would increase total cost, so an infinitesimal expansion is not justified.**\nThe sign is incorrect for the economic definition of a shadow price (a marginal value or benefit). While the formal Lagrange multiplier for this constraint is indeed negative (equal to $C_1 - C_2$), its interpretation here is flawed. A negative multiplier implies that increasing the RHS *decreases* the objective function (cost), meaning expansion is beneficial. This option incorrectly concludes the opposite.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. The shadow price equals the full unit cost at $R_2$, $0.30667\\,\\$/\\text{L}$; since this exceeds $\\gamma = 0.050$, expansion should not be undertaken.**\nThe shadow price is the *difference* in marginal costs ($C_2 - C_1$), not the full marginal cost of the displaced production ($C_2$). The premise is factually wrong. Furthermore, the reasoning is contradictory: if the benefit ($0.30667$) were to exceed the cost ($0.050$), expansion *should* be undertaken, not the other way around.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Dual variables for capacity constraints are not meaningful in Mixed-Integer Linear Programming, so the shadow price cannot be computed or interpreted for $K_1$.**\nThis statement is an overgeneralization and is false in the context of this problem. The problem explicitly directs the analysis to the \"continuous linear programming substructure\" and \"the usual sense of linear programming duality\". For the resulting LP model, the shadow price is well-defined, computable, and highly meaningful for economic interpretation. The mention of MILP in the problem description provides context but does not invalidate the application of LP duality as requested.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

The system boundary is cradle-to-gate for the processing of one metric tonne ($1$ t) of dry lignocellulosic biomass.\n\nFirst, we define and quantify the total system emissions and the energy content of the co-products based on the provided data.\n\nThe total upstream and process emissions, denoted as $E_{total}$, are the sum of the supply-chain emissions ($E_{up}$) and the biorefinery process emissions ($E_{proc}$).\nLet $E_{up} = 120 \\text{ kg } \\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e}$ and $E_{proc} = 300 \\text{ kg } \\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e}$.\n$$\nE_{total} = E_{up} + E_{proc} = 120 \\text{ kg } \\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e} + 300 \\text{ kg } \\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e} = 420 \\text{ kg } \\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e}\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate the energy content of the two co-products: fuel ethanol and surplus electricity.\n\nThe energy content of the ethanol, $En_{eth}$, is the product of the ethanol yield per tonne of biomass, $Y_{eth} = 300 \\text{ L/t}$, and the Lower Heating Value (LHV) of ethanol, $LHV_{eth} = 21.1 \\text{ MJ/L}$.\n$$\nEn_{eth} = Y_{eth} \\times LHV_{eth} = 300 \\text{ L} \\times 21.1 \\frac{\\text{MJ}}{\\text{L}} = 6330 \\text{ MJ}\n$$\n\nThe energy content of the exported electricity, $En_{elec}$, is the product of the net electricity exported per tonne, $Q_{elec} = 0.60 \\text{ MWh/t}$, and the conversion factor from megawatt-hours to megajoules, $C_{conv} = 3600 \\text{ MJ/MWh}$.\n$$\nEn_{elec} = Q_{elec} \\times C_{conv} = 0.60 \\text{ MWh} \\times 3600 \\frac{\\text{MJ}}{\\text{MWh}} = 2160 \\text{ MJ}\n$$\n\nNow we can calculate the GHG intensity of ethanol for each of the two specified methods.\n\n**1. Energy Allocation Method**\n\nUnder the energy allocation approach, the total GHG burden ($E_{total}$) is distributed between the co-products in proportion to their respective energy contents. The total energy output of the system is $En_{total\\_alloc}$.\n$$\nEn_{total\\_alloc} = En_{eth} + En_{elec} = 6330 \\text{ MJ} + 2160 \\text{ MJ} = 8490 \\text{ MJ}\n$$\nThe fraction of the total energy attributed to ethanol is $f_{eth} = \\frac{En_{eth}}{En_{total\\_alloc}}$. The emissions allocated to ethanol, $E_{eth\\_alloc}$, are then $E_{total} \\times f_{eth}$.\nThe GHG intensity for ethanol under energy allocation, $I_{alloc}$, is the allocated emissions divided by the ethanol energy:\n$$\nI_{alloc} = \\frac{E_{eth\\_alloc}}{En_{eth}} = \\frac{E_{total} \\times \\frac{En_{eth}}{En_{total\\_alloc}}}{En_{eth}} = \\frac{E_{total}}{En_{total\\_alloc}}\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\nI_{alloc} = \\frac{420 \\text{ kg } \\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e}}{8490 \\text{ MJ}}\n$$\n\n**2. System Expansion Method**\n\nUnder the system expansion (or substitution) approach, the co-product (electricity) is assumed to displace an equivalent product on the market (grid electricity). This displacement results in an avoided emissions credit, $E_{credit}$, which is subtracted from the total system emissions. The grid-average GHG emission factor is given as $I_{grid} = 450 \\text{ kg } \\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e}/\\text{MWh}$.\nThe credit is calculated as:\n$$\nE_{credit} = Q_{elec} \\times I_{grid} = 0.60 \\text{ MWh} \\times 450 \\frac{\\text{kg } \\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e}}{\\text{MWh}} = 270 \\text{ kg } \\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e}\n$$\nThe net emissions for the system, $E_{net}$, are then attributed entirely to the main product, ethanol.\n$$\nE_{net} = E_{total} - E_{credit} = 420 \\text{ kg } \\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e} - 270 \\text{ kg } \\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e} = 150 \\text{ kg } \\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e}\n$$\nThe GHG intensity for ethanol under system expansion, $I_{exp}$, is these net emissions divided by the ethanol energy content.\n$$\nI_{exp} = \\frac{E_{net}}{En_{eth}} = \\frac{150 \\text{ kg } \\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e}}{6330 \\text{ MJ}}\n$$\n\n**3. Compute the Difference**\n\nThe problem asks for the difference, $D$, defined as the energy-allocation intensity minus the system-expansion intensity.\n$$\nD = I_{alloc} - I_{exp} = \\frac{420}{8490} \\frac{\\text{kg } \\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e}}{\\text{MJ}} - \\frac{150}{6330} \\frac{\\text{kg } \\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e}}{\\text{MJ}}\n$$\nTo express the result in grams of $\\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e}$ per megajoule (g $\\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e}$/MJ), we multiply by $1000 \\text{ g/kg}$.\n$$\nD \\left[\\frac{\\text{g } \\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e}}{\\text{MJ}}\\right] = \\left( \\frac{420}{8490} - \\frac{150}{6330} \\right) \\times 1000\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\nD = \\left( 0.04946996... - 0.02370000... \\right) \\times 1000\n$$\n$$\nD = (0.02576996...) \\times 1000 = 25.76996... \\frac{\\text{g } \\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e}}{\\text{MJ}}\n$$\nTo be more precise, we can use the fractional forms. Let's simplify the fractions:\n$\\frac{420}{8490} = \\frac{42}{849} = \\frac{14}{283}$\n$\\frac{150}{6330} = \\frac{15}{633} = \\frac{5}{211}$\n$$\nD = \\left( \\frac{14}{283} - \\frac{5}{211} \\right) \\times 1000 = \\left( \\frac{14 \\times 211 - 5 \\times 283}{283 \\times 211} \\right) \\times 1000\n$$\n$$\nD = \\left( \\frac{2954 - 1415}{59713} \\right) \\times 1000 = \\frac{1539}{59713} \\times 1000 \\approx 25.774008... \\frac{\\text{g } \\text{CO}_{2}\\text{e}}{\\text{MJ}}\n$$\nRounding the final answer to four significant figures gives $25.77$.",
