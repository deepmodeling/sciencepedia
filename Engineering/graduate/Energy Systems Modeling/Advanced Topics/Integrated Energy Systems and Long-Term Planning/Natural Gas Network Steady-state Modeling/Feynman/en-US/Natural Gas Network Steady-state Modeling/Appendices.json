We will proceed by first deriving the core equation from first principles and then applying the numerical constraints to find the solution.\n\nThe steady, one-dimensional momentum balance for flow in a horizontal pipe of length $L$ and diameter $D$ is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{d p}{d x} + \\rho v \\frac{d v}{d x} + \\frac{f}{D} \\frac{\\rho v^2}{2} = 0\n$$\nwhere $p$ is the pressure, $x$ is the spatial coordinate along the pipe, $\\rho$ is the gas density, $v$ is the fluid velocity, and $f$ is the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor. The first term represents the pressure gradient, the second term is the inertial (convective acceleration) term, and the third term is the frictional pressure drop.\n\nFor natural gas transmission pipelines, where pipe lengths are typically long, the frictional losses dominate over the change in kinetic energy. Thus, it is a standard and valid engineering simplification to neglect the inertial term $\\rho v \\frac{dv}{dx}$. The problem's request for an \"algebraic relation\" and the provision of a single resistance coefficient $\\alpha_e$ strongly support this simplification.\n\nNeglecting the inertial term, the momentum equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{d p}{d x} = -\\frac{f}{2D} \\rho v^2\n$$\nThe mass flow rate $q$ is constant along the pipe due to steady flow: $q = \\rho A v$, where $A = \\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}$ is the constant cross-sectional area.

            "solution": "The problem asks for an evaluation of several statements regarding the squared-pressure formulation for steady-state, isothermal, horizontal natural gas pipeline flow. First, we must derive the fundamental algebraic relationship between nodal pressures and mass flow, and then express it using the squared-pressure variables.\n\n### Derivation of the Pipe Flow Equation\n\nThe analysis begins with the one-dimensional momentum balance for steady internal flow in a pipe of constant cross-section, oriented along the $x$-axis from node $i$ (at $x=0$) to node $j$ (at $x=L_{ij}$):\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dx} + \\rho v \\frac{dv}{dx} + \\frac{f}{2D}\\rho v^2 = 0\n$$\nwhere $p$ is the pressure, $\\rho$ is the gas density, $v$ is the fluid velocity, $D$ is the pipe diameter, and $f$ is the Darcy-Weisbach friction factor. The problem states to neglect elevation changes, so the gravity term is absent.\n\nFor steady flow, the mass flow rate $q = \\rho v A$ is constant along the pipe, where $A$ is the constant cross-sectional area.\nThe term $\\rho v \\frac{dv}{dx}$ represents the change in momentum flux. In many practical analyses of high-pressure gas transmission pipelines, this kinetic energy term is often considered negligible compared to the friction term. To obtain a simple algebraic relation as requested, we adopt this standard simplification. The momentum balance reduces to:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dx} + \\frac{f}{2D}\\rho v^2 = 0\n$$\nFrom the definition of mass flow rate, we have $v = q / (\\rho A)$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dx} + \\frac{f}{2D}\\rho \\left(\\frac{q}{\\rho A}\\right)^2 = 0 \\implies \\frac{dp}{dx} + \\frac{f q^2}{2DA^2} \\frac{1}{\\rho} = 0\n$$\nThe problem provides the Ideal Gas Law in the form $\\rho = p/(ZRT)$, where the specific gas constant $R$, compressibility factor $Z$, and absolute temperature $T$ are all constant. Substituting for $\\rho$:\n$$\n\\frac{dp}{dx} + \\frac{f q^2}{2DA^2} \\frac{ZRT}{p} = 0\n$$\nTo find the relationship between the pressures at the two ends of the pipe, we separate variables and integrate.\n$$\np \\, dp = - \\frac{f q^2 ZRT}{2DA^2} dx\n$$\nWe integrate from $x=0$ (node $i$, pressure $p_i$) to $x=L_{ij}$ (node $j$, pressure $p_j$). The flow variable $q_{ij}$ is defined as positive for flow from $i$ to $j$.\n$$\n\\int_{p_i}^{p_j} p \\, dp = - \\int_0^{L_{ij}} \\frac{f_{ij} q_{ij}^2 ZRT}{2D_{ij}A_{ij}^2} dx\n$$\n$$\n\\left[ \\frac{p^2}{2} \\right]_{p_i}^{p_j} = - \\frac{f_{ij} L_{ij} ZRT}{2D_{ij}A_{ij}^2} q_{ij}^2\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{p_j^2 - p_i^2}{2} = - \\frac{f_{ij} L_{ij} ZRT}{2D_{ij}A_{ij}^2} q_{ij}^2\n$$\nMultiplying by $-2$ and rearranging gives the relation for flow from $i$ to $j$ (where $p_i > p_j$ and $q_{ij} > 0$):\n$$\np_i^2 - p_j^2 = \\frac{f_{ij} L_{ij} ZRT}{D_{ij}A_{ij}^2} q_{ij}^2\n$$\nTo account for bidirectional flow, where $q_{ij}$ can be negative, we write the equation as:\n$$\np_i^2 - p_j^2 = k_{ij} q_{ij} |q_{ij}|\n$$\nwhere the pipe constant $k_{ij} = \\frac{f_{ij} L_{ij} ZRT}{D_{ij}A_{ij}^2} > 0$.\n\n### Transformation to Squared-Pressure Coordinates\n\nThe problem defines the new variables $P_i = p_i^2$. Substituting this into the derived pipe relation yields:\n$$\nP_i - P_j = k_{ij} q_{ij} |q_{ij}|\n$$\nWe now evaluate each statement based on this transformed equation.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Introducing $P_i = p_i^2$ renders each pipe law affine in the nodal variables $(P_i, P_j)$, but the constraint $P_i - P_j = k_{ij} q_{ij}^2$ defines a nonconvex feasible set in $(P, q)$.**\nThe first part is correct. The equation $P_i - P_j = k_{ij} q_{ij} |q_{ij}|$ is linear (and thus affine) in $P_i$ and $P_j$. The second part is also correct. An equality constraint $g(x)=0$ defines a convex set if and only if $g(x)$ is an affine function. The function $g(P_i, P_j, q_{ij}) = P_i - P_j - k_{ij} q_{ij}^2$ (for unidirectional flow) is quadratic in $q_{ij}$, not affine. Therefore, the set of points $(P_i, P_j, q_{ij})$ satisfying the constraint is non-convex.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. A compressor edge with fixed compression ratio $r_{ij} > 1$ modeled by $p_j = r_{ij} p_i$ becomes $P_j = r_{ij}^2 P_i$ under the squared-pressure change of variables, which is a linear equality and can be advantageous for mixed-integer linear programming formulations.**\nGiven $p_j = r_{ij} p_i$. Since $p_i = \\sqrt{P_i}$ and $p_j = \\sqrt{P_j}$ (for $p > 0$), we have $\\sqrt{P_j} = r_{ij} \\sqrt{P_i}$. Squaring both sides yields $P_j = r_{ij}^2 P_i$. This is a homogeneous linear equality in the variables $P_i$ and $P_j$. Transforming a nonlinear model into a linear one is a significant practical advantage for optimization.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. Pressure bounds $p_i^{\\min} \\le p_i \\le p_i^{\\max}$ translate into convex quadratic inequalities in $P_i$ that are nonlinear and tend to destroy the convexity of otherwise linear programs.**\nGiven $p_i^{\\min} \\le p_i \\le p_i^{\\max}$, and assuming $0 < p_i^{\\min}$, squaring the inequalities gives $(p_i^{\\min})^2 \\le P_i \\le (p_i^{\\max})^2$. These are simple box constraints on $P_i$, which are linear inequalities. They are not quadratic or nonlinear, and they define a convex interval. The statement is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. If the Darcy–Weisbach friction factor depends on Reynolds number, hence on flow, the coefficient linking $P_i - P_j$ to $q_{ij}^2$ becomes flow-dependent, weakening or eliminating the linearity in $P$-coordinates that holds under constant-property assumptions.**\nThe friction factor $f_{ij}$ is generally a function of the Reynolds number, which depends on the flow rate $|q_{ij}|$. Consequently, the pipe coefficient $k_{ij}$ also becomes a function of flow, $k_{ij}(|q_{ij}|)$. The pipe equation becomes $P_i - P_j = k_{ij}(|q_{ij}|) q_{ij} |q_{ij}|$. While the equation remains linear in $P_i$ and $P_j$, the right-hand side is a more complex nonlinear function of $q_{ij}$. This dependency couples the pressures and flows in a more complicated way, which weakens the practical benefits of the transformation for optimization.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**E. Reparametrizing to $P_i = p_i^2$ automatically improves numerical conditioning because $|P_i - P_j| > |p_i - p_j|$ always holds for $p_i, p_j > 0$.**\nThe claim is $|p_i^2 - p_j^2| > |p_i - p_j|$. This is equivalent to $|p_i - p_j|(p_i + p_j) > |p_i - p_j|$ (since $p_i, p_j > 0$). If $p_i \\neq p_j$, this simplifies to $p_i + p_j > 1$. This is not universally true; it depends on the units of pressure. For example, if $p_i = 0.5$ atm and $p_j = 0.4$ atm, then $p_i + p_j = 0.9 \\ngtr 1$. The premise is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**F. In the squared-pressure formulation, the sign of $P_i - P_j$ uniquely determines the sign of $q_{ij}$ on every pipe, so binary variables for flow direction are unnecessary in all network optimization contexts.**\nThe first part is true: from $P_i - P_j = k_{ij} q_{ij} |q_{ij}|$, we have $\\text{sign}(P_i - P_j) = \\text{sign}(q_{ij})$. However, the conclusion is false. The non-convex nature of this constraint often requires the introduction of binary variables to model it within convex optimization frameworks (like MILP or MISOCP) to guarantee finding a global optimum. These binary variables are used to manage the disjunction (e.g., \"if flow is positive... else if flow is negative...\").\n**Verdict: Incorrect**",

The constants are $p_1 = 50$, $d_2 = 5$, and $\\alpha = 0.02$.\n\n- **Evaluate the residual vector $F^{(k)} = F(x^{(k)})$**:\n$$ F_1^{(k)} = q_{12}^{(k)} - d_2 = 3 - 5 = -2 $$\n$$ F_2^{(k)} = (q_{12}^{(k)})^2 - \\alpha((p_1)^2 - (p_2^{(k)})^2) = 3^2 - 0.02(50^2 - 49^2) = 9 - 0.02(2500 - 2401) = 9 - 0.02(99) = 9 - 1.98 = 7.02 $$\nSo, the residual vector is $F^{(k)} = \\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ 7.02 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n- **Evaluate the Jacobian matrix $J^{(k)} = J(x^{(k)})$**:\n$$ J^{(k)} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 2(0.02)(49) & 2(3) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1.96 & 6 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\n- **Solve the linear system $J^{(k)} \\Delta x^{(k)} = -F^{(k)}$**:\nLet the Newton step be $\\Delta x^{(k)} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\Delta p_2 \\\\ \\Delta q_{12} \\end{pmatrix}$. The system is:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1.96 & 6 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\Delta p_2 \\\\ \\Delta q_{12} \\end{pmatrix} = - \\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\\\ 7.02 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\\\ -7.02 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis expands to a system of two linear equations:\n1) $0 \\cdot \\Delta p_2 + 1 \\cdot \\Delta q_{12} = 2$\n2) $1.96 \\cdot \\Delta p_2 + 6 \\cdot \\Delta q_{12} = -7.02$\n\nFrom equation (1), we immediately find:\n$$ \\Delta q_{12} = 2 $$\nSubstituting this into equation (2):\n$$ 1.96 \\cdot \\Delta p_2 + 6(2) = -7.02 $$\n$$ 1.96 \\cdot \\Delta p_2 + 12 = -7.02 $$\n$$ 1.96 \\cdot \\Delta p_2 = -19.02 $$\n$$ \\Delta p_2 = \\frac{-19.02}{1.96} \\approx -9.7040816 $$\n\n### 4. Update the State\nThe new state $x^{(k+1)}$ is found by adding the step $\\Delta x^{(k)}$ to the previous state $x^{(k)}$:\n$$ x^{(k+1)} = x^{(k)} + \\Delta x^{(k)} $$\n$$ p_2^{(k+1)} = p_2^{(k)} + \\Delta p_2 = 49 + (-9.7040816) = 39.2959184 \\text{ bar} $$\n$$ q_{12}^{(k+1)} = q_{12}^{(k)} + \\Delta q_{12} = 3 + 2 = 5 \\text{ Sm}^3/\\text{s} $$\n\nRounding the results to four significant figures:\n$$ p_2^{(k+1)} = 39.30 \\text{ bar} $$\n$$ q_{12}^{(k+1)} = 5.000 \\text{ Sm}^3/\\text{s} $$\n\n### 5. Physical Interpretation of the Update\nThe update step provides a clear physical correction to the initial state. The initial flow ($3$ Sm$^3$/s) did not match the demand ($5$ Sm$^3$/s), creating a mass balance deficit. The flow update, $\\Delta q_{12} = +2$ Sm$^3$/s, perfectly corrects this, bringing the flow to the required $5$ Sm$^3$/s. To drive this higher flow through the pipe, a larger pressure drop is physically necessary. Since the upstream pressure $p_1$ is fixed at $50$ bar, the downstream pressure $p_2$ must decrease. The large negative pressure update, $\\Delta p_2 \\approx -9.70$ bar, accomplishes this, lowering $p_2$ to a value that is consistent with the higher flow rate according to the Weymouth equation.",
