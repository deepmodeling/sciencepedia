## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

Having established the foundational principles and mechanisms of Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) in the preceding chapters, we now turn to their application. This chapter explores how the core components of IAMs—their coupling of economic, energy, and climate systems—are utilized to address complex scientific questions, inform policy debates, and forecast technological futures. IAMs are not predictive crystal balls but rather sophisticated laboratories for exploring the long-term consequences of today's choices. Their true power lies at the intersection of disciplines, synthesizing knowledge from economics, [earth system science](@entry_id:175035), engineering, and social science to provide a holistic view of the climate change challenge.

This chapter is structured around three principal domains of application. First, we will examine how IAMs are used at a high level to develop global scenarios and evaluate the efficiency of [climate policy](@entry_id:1122477) instruments. Second, we will delve into the more granular representation of key technological and sectoral systems, particularly the energy sector, which is central to the climate mitigation problem. Finally, we will explore advanced economic and welfare considerations, such as the valuation of climate damages, the role of adaptation, and questions of inter-regional equity. Through these examples, the utility of the IAM framework as a bridge between abstract principles and applied, policy-relevant analysis will become evident.

### Scenario Development and Climate Policy Analysis

One of the most prominent applications of IAMs is in the development of long-term scenarios of socioeconomic development and climate change, which provide the foundation for the scientific assessments of bodies like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). These models are also indispensable tools for comparing the economic efficiency and environmental effectiveness of various climate policies.

#### The Architecture of Global Scenarios: SSPs and RCPs

Modern climate research is organized around a scenario matrix architecture that pairs Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) with Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). This framework is designed to separate assumptions about future socioeconomic development from assumptions about climate policy ambition. IAMs are the essential analytical tool that connects these two dimensions.

The SSPs describe a set of distinct, plausible futures for the world, each with a unique narrative and quantitative trajectories for key drivers like [population growth](@entry_id:139111), economic development, technological progress, and social values. Crucially, SSPs are defined as "policy-neutral" baseline scenarios; they describe worlds with varying challenges to mitigation and adaptation but do not, by themselves, assume any new, globally coordinated climate policies. An RCP, in contrast, is a target trajectory for radiative forcing by a given year (e.g., $2.6$, $4.5$, or $6.0$ W/m² by 2100), representing a specific level of climate ambition.

The role of an IAM is to bridge this gap. An IAM takes an SSP as a set of boundary conditions and then determines the emissions pathway that would result from that socioeconomic trajectory. The model can then be used to explore what additional policies (e.g., carbon prices or technology mandates) would be needed to bend the baseline emissions curve downwards to achieve a specific RCP target. Thus, a single SSP can be paired with multiple RCPs, depending on the stringency of the climate policy assumed within the IAM. This framework allows researchers to systematically explore questions such as: "What is the cost of achieving a $2^\circ$C target (approximated by an RCP) in a world characterized by rapid, fossil-fueled growth (SSP5) versus a world focused on sustainability (SSP1)?" .

The internal consistency of these scenarios can be explored using simplified IAM structures. For instance, by combining the Kaya identity, which decomposes CO₂ emissions into population, per capita GDP, energy intensity of GDP, and carbon intensity of energy, with a simple one-box [carbon cycle model](@entry_id:1122069) and a logarithmic forcing relationship for CO₂, one can perform a back-of-the-envelope calculation. Such an exercise can verify whether a narrative's assumed rates of economic growth and technological change are quantitatively compatible with a desired radiative forcing target. This process of mapping socioeconomic drivers to emissions, concentrations, and finally to climate forcing is the fundamental causal chain at the heart of every IAM .

#### Evaluating Climate Policy Instruments

Beyond building scenarios, IAMs serve as testbeds for evaluating the economic implications of different policy designs. The primary criterion for such an evaluation from an economic perspective is [cost-effectiveness](@entry_id:894855): achieving a given emissions reduction target at the lowest possible total cost to society. The principle of [cost-effectiveness](@entry_id:894855) dictates that the [marginal abatement cost](@entry_id:1127617)—the cost of reducing one additional ton of a pollutant—should be equalized across all sources of emissions. If it is cheaper for Firm A to abate than Firm B, overall costs can be lowered by having Firm A do more and Firm B do less, until their marginal costs are equal.

IAMs formalize this by representing heterogeneous firms or sectors with distinct [marginal abatement cost](@entry_id:1127617) (MAC) curves. Within this framework, different policy instruments can be analyzed:

-   **Market-Based Instruments:** A uniform carbon tax imposes a price on every unit of emissions, leading all firms to abate until their MAC equals the tax rate. Similarly, a cap-and-trade system sets a total emissions limit (a cap) and allows firms to trade permits. In a competitive market, a uniform permit price will emerge, and firms will abate until their MAC equals that price. In both cases, the instrument automatically equalizes MACs across all firms, thus achieving a cost-effective outcome. Under conditions of certainty, a tax set at the optimal level and a cap set at the optimal level are equivalent in their ability to achieve an efficient allocation .

-   **Command-and-Control Instruments:** In contrast, uniform performance standards (e.g., an emissions rate limit) or technology mandates (e.g., requiring all firms to install a specific technology) generally fail to achieve cost-effectiveness. These policies do not allow firms to make trade-offs based on their individual costs. A uniform standard forces all firms to meet the same target, regardless of whether it is cheap or expensive for them to do so, leading to a situation where MACs are not equalized and the total cost of abatement is higher than necessary .

#### International Policy and Cumulative Budgets

The global nature of climate change introduces further complexities that IAMs are well-suited to analyze. Unilateral climate policy by one country or region can lead to "[carbon leakage](@entry_id:1122073)," where emissions reductions in the regulating region are partially offset by an increase in emissions elsewhere. This can occur, for instance, if an energy-intensive industry relocates from a country with a carbon tax to one without. IAMs with multi-region trade components can quantify this effect. A stylized two-region model can demonstrate how a carbon tax in one region raises its production costs, increases the world price of the traded good, and incentivizes the untaxed region to increase its production and, consequently, its emissions. The leakage rate, defined as the increase in foreign emissions divided by the reduction in domestic emissions, is a critical metric for evaluating the global effectiveness of sub-global policies .

More recently, climate science has emphasized the importance of cumulative carbon budgets—the total amount of CO₂ that can be emitted while keeping warming below a certain level. IAMs can frame [climate policy](@entry_id:1122477) as a [dynamic optimization](@entry_id:145322) problem: minimizing the discounted costs of mitigation over time, subject to not exceeding a fixed cumulative budget. This framework naturally allows for the inclusion of Negative Emissions Technologies (NETs), which can remove CO₂ from the atmosphere. In such a model, net emissions in any period are gross emissions from economic activity minus mitigation and minus removals by NETs. The [optimality conditions](@entry_id:634091) derived from such a model reveal that both mitigation and removal should be undertaken up to the point where their marginal cost equals the [shadow price of carbon](@entry_id:1131526). This framework can also transparently account for real-world imperfections, such as the "leakage" or non-permanence of some carbon removal methods, by adjusting their effective contribution to the carbon budget .

### Detailed Sectoral and Technological Representations

While some IAMs operate at a highly aggregated level, many contain detailed "bottom-up" modules that represent the physical and economic characteristics of key sectors, most notably the energy system. These modules allow for a more realistic analysis of decarbonization pathways.

#### Energy Systems Modeling within IAMs

The electricity sector is a cornerstone of most mitigation strategies. IAMs often include sophisticated capacity expansion submodules to explore its transformation. These can be formulated as optimization problems, often linear programs, that choose a least-cost portfolio of generation technologies and storage assets over time. The model's decision variables include the installed capacity of each technology (e.g., solar PV, wind, natural gas, nuclear), the amount of electricity generated by each, and the charging/discharging of energy storage. The model minimizes the total discounted cost of building and operating the system, subject to a series of constraints: meeting electricity demand in every time period, respecting the physical availability of resources (like sun and wind), and obeying the engineering limits of storage systems (power, energy, and efficiency) .

A particularly important and challenging aspect of modern energy system modeling is the integration of high shares of Variable Renewable Energy (VRE) like wind and solar. Their intermittent nature requires a more detailed representation of [system reliability](@entry_id:274890). IAMs are increasingly incorporating concepts such as:
-   **Curtailment:** The deliberate reduction of VRE output when generation exceeds demand or grid capacity. This is an economic decision representing a loss of potential clean energy.
-   **Capacity Credit:** This parameter represents the firm-equivalent contribution of a VRE resource to system reliability. A $K^{\mathrm{vre}}$ of wind capacity does not provide the same reliability benefit as a $K^{\mathrm{firm}}$ of dispatchable capacity; its capacity credit, $\phi$, is typically a small fraction of its nameplate capacity, reflecting its probability of being available during periods of peak system stress.
-   **Adequacy Constraints:** To ensure the lights stay on, models impose planning reserve margin constraints. These require that the total dependable capacity—the sum of derated firm capacity, the capacity credit of VREs, and the power capacity of storage—exceeds the peak system demand by a safety margin .

#### Modeling Endogenous Technological Change

The long-term cost of decarbonization depends critically on the future costs of low-carbon technologies. Rather than assuming these costs exogenously, many IAMs model "[endogenous technological change](@entry_id:1124428)," where costs decline as a function of cumulative investment or production. The most common formulation is the one-factor "learning curve" or "experience curve," often called Wright's Law.

This model posits a power-law relationship between the unit cost of a technology, $C(Q)$, and its cumulative production, $Q$. The relationship is governed by a constant elasticity, $-\alpha$, such that $C(Q)$ is proportional to $Q^{-\alpha}$. This mathematical form arises directly from the assumption that a given percentage increase in cumulative experience leads to a fixed percentage decrease in cost. This elasticity, $\alpha$, is related to the more intuitive "learning rate," $LR$, which is the fractional cost reduction observed for every doubling of cumulative production. The relationship is given by $LR = 1 - 2^{-\alpha}$. By incorporating these [learning curves](@entry_id:636273), IAMs can capture the powerful feedback loop whereby policies that promote the deployment of new technologies also drive down their costs, making future abatement cheaper .

### Advanced Economic and Welfare Considerations

IAMs are not just biophysical simulators; they are rooted in the principles of welfare economics. This allows them to address normative questions about the desirability of policies, the value of avoiding climate impacts, and the equitable distribution of costs and benefits. The entire structure of a typical IAM can be understood as a formal representation of the scientific and economic inputs needed to analyze these questions in a coherent framework .

#### The Social Cost of Carbon (SCC)

A central concept that emerges from IAMs is the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC). The SCC is the monetized value of the net harm to society from emitting one additional tonne of CO₂. It is a critical metric used in regulatory [cost-benefit analysis](@entry_id:200072). IAMs provide two complementary ways to conceptualize and calculate the SCC.

In a welfare-maximization framework (often called a cost-benefit approach), the SCC is derived from first principles. It is the sum of all future, discounted marginal damages to consumption caused by an additional unit of emissions. A stylized derivation shows that the SCC depends on the magnitude of physical damages, the rate at which future damages are discounted, societal aversion to risk, and the level of future economic growth .

In a [cost-effectiveness](@entry_id:894855) framework, where the goal is to meet a predetermined climate target (like a cumulative carbon budget) at minimum cost, the SCC takes on a different but related meaning. It becomes the [shadow price](@entry_id:137037) of the carbon [budget constraint](@entry_id:146950)—the marginal cost of abatement required to meet the target. In this context, a fundamental result known as Hotelling's rule emerges: for an optimal abatement path with stationary technology costs, the SCC must rise over time at the social rate of time preference. This reflects the increasing scarcity of the [remaining carbon budget](@entry_id:1130832); it becomes progressively more valuable to save a unit of the budget for the future, so the price required to incentivize that saving must rise .

#### Modeling Damages and Adaptation

A comprehensive assessment of [climate policy](@entry_id:1122477) requires a careful accounting of climate impacts and our capacity to adapt to them. A key trade-off for society is how to allocate resources between mitigation (reducing the magnitude of climate change) and adaptation (reducing our vulnerability to its effects). IAMs can formalize this choice as an optimization problem, where a social planner chooses the welfare-maximizing mix of mitigation and adaptation expenditures, balancing the costs of these actions against the benefits of reduced climate damages .

A sophisticated IAM must also distinguish between different categories of damages. A crucial distinction is made between:
-   **Market Damages:** These are impacts that affect economic production and are reflected in GDP accounts, such as agricultural losses or damage to infrastructure from [sea-level rise](@entry_id:185213).
-   **Non-Market Damages:** These are impacts that affect human well-being directly but are not transacted in markets, such as the loss of [biodiversity](@entry_id:139919), [ecosystem services](@entry_id:147516), or direct health impacts like heat stress.

A logically consistent IAM must treat these two categories differently. Market damages (net of adaptation) appear as a loss of physical resources in the economy's [budget constraint](@entry_id:146950). Non-market damages, by contrast, enter directly into the [social welfare function](@entry_id:636846) as a source of disutility, separate from the consumption of goods and services. This separation ensures that the full spectrum of climate impacts is considered without violating the principles of national income accounting .

#### Regional Disaggregation and Equity

Finally, since the causes and consequences of climate change are distributed unevenly across the globe, globally aggregated models can hide crucial information about regional disparities. Many large-scale IAMs are therefore disaggregated into multiple regions, each with its own specific economic structure, technological portfolio, and vulnerability to climate damages. This allows for the analysis of distributional consequences of both climate change and climate policy.

When aggregating welfare across regions to find a "globally optimal" policy, a critical normative step is required. Most IAMs construct a global [social welfare function](@entry_id:636846) as a weighted sum of regional welfare functions. The "equity weights" used in this summation reflect ethical judgments about the relative value of consumption increases for poor versus wealthy regions. These weights are not scientific parameters but normative choices, and their specification can have a profound impact on the model's recommended policy, highlighting the deep integration of science, economics, and ethics within the IAM framework .

In conclusion, the applications of Integrated Assessment Models are as broad and interdisciplinary as the climate problem itself. From shaping the global scenarios that guide international negotiations to detailing the engineering constraints of the energy transition and confronting the deepest ethical questions of intergenerational and inter-regional equity, IAMs provide an indispensable, though stylized, framework for structured thinking about our collective future on a changing planet.
