## Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections

Having established the theoretical foundations and mechanical structure of Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) and Input–Output (I-O) models in the preceding chapters, we now turn to their principal purpose: application. These models are not mere academic abstractions; they are powerful analytical laboratories used globally by governments, international organizations, and research institutions to explore the complex, economy-wide ramifications of policies and external shocks. This chapter demonstrates the utility and versatility of CGE and I-O frameworks by exploring their application across a range of critical, interdisciplinary domains. We will move from core environmental and energy policy analysis to broader considerations of economic incidence, international trade, and long-term dynamics, culminating in a discussion of how these models are integrated with other analytical traditions to tackle multifaceted modern challenges.

### Core Policy Analysis: Environmental and Energy Policy

The primary impetus for the development and widespread adoption of CGE and I-O models has been the need to understand the intricate relationship between the economy and the environment. These models provide an unparalleled ability to trace the physical and economic consequences of environmental policies throughout the entire economic system.

#### Quantifying Environmental Footprints

A foundational application of I-O analysis is its use in environmental and energy accounting. The I-O table, which details the flow of goods and services between industrial sectors, can be augmented with "satellite accounts" that track physical quantities, such as energy use or greenhouse gas emissions, associated with each sector's production. This allows analysts to move beyond a sector's direct emissions to calculate the total emissions "embodied" in a final product.

The total output $x$ required to satisfy a vector of final demand $y$ is given by the well-known Leontief relationship $x = (I - A)^{-1}y$, where $(I - A)^{-1}$ is the Leontief inverse matrix. If we define a vector of direct energy intensities, $e$, whose elements $e_s$ represent the primary energy consumed per unit of gross output in sector $s$, we can calculate the total primary energy embodied in the production chain required to deliver the final demand bundle $y$. This total embodied energy, $E_{\text{emb}}$, is the sum of the direct energy intensities weighted by the required gross outputs: $E_{\text{emb}} = e^{\top}x = e^{\top}(I - A)^{-1}y$. This type of analysis is fundamental to life-cycle assessments and carbon footprinting, providing a comprehensive view of the resource requirements of consumption patterns .

#### Analyzing Price and Cost Pass-Through

When a policy, such as a carbon tax, imposes a new cost on certain sectors, that cost does not remain localized. It propagates through the economy's complex web of supply chains, ultimately affecting the prices of all goods and services. The dual, or price-side, formulation of the Leontief I-O model is the classic tool for analyzing this phenomenon.

In this framework, the price of a good is determined by the sum of its input costs. The vector of unit prices, $p$, is equal to the sum of the costs of intermediate inputs, $A^{\top}p$, and the cost of primary inputs (value-added), $v$. This gives the relationship $p = A^{\top}p + v$. Solving for prices yields $p^{\top} = v^{\top}(I-A)^{-1}$. This powerful equation demonstrates that final prices are a function of primary input costs, magnified by the Leontief inverse, which captures the full cascade of direct and indirect input requirements. A policy that introduces a carbon tax can be modeled as an exogenous increase in the value-added component of carbon-intensive sectors. By applying this framework, analysts can compute the resulting change in the equilibrium price vector, thereby quantifying how the initial cost shock is passed through to other industries and, ultimately, to final consumers .

#### Comparing Policy Instruments: Tax vs. Cap-and-Trade

CGE models are particularly adept at comparing the economic implications of different policy instruments designed to achieve the same environmental goal. The two most prominent market-based instruments for climate policy are the carbon tax and the cap-and-trade system. While often discussed as equivalents, they are modeled in fundamentally distinct ways that reflect their different operational logics.

A **carbon tax** is a price instrument. The government sets an exogenous tax rate, $\tau$, on each unit of emissions. In a CGE model, this is represented as an additional cost component in each firm's production or cost function. For a firm in sector $j$ with an emissions intensity of $a_{Ej}$ per unit of output, the zero-profit condition is modified to $p_j = c_j(\mathbf{p},\mathbf{w}) + a_{Ej}\tau$, where $c_j(\cdot)$ is the unit cost of non-carbon inputs. The total level of emissions is an endogenous outcome of the model, determined by how firms and consumers respond to the new price landscape.

A **[cap-and-trade](@entry_id:187637)** system is a quantity instrument. The government sets an exogenous cap, $\bar{E}$, on total allowable emissions and issues a corresponding number of tradable permits. This creates a new, artificial market. To model this, a permit is introduced as a new commodity. Firms are required to purchase permits to cover their emissions, adding a new input cost, $a_{Ej}p_{\theta}$, to their cost function, where $p_{\theta}$ is the endogenous price of an emissions permit. Crucially, a new market-clearing condition is added to the model: the total demand for permits, $\sum_{j} a_{Ej} x_j$, must equal the fixed supply, $\bar{E}$. This condition endogenously determines the permit price $p_{\theta}$ .

A key insight from modeling [cap-and-trade](@entry_id:187637) systems is that they achieve a given emissions reduction at the minimum possible cost to the economy. This is because the single, market-clearing permit price $p_{\theta}$ incentivizes all firms to abate until their [marginal abatement cost](@entry_id:1127617) (MAC) is equal to that price. Sectors with low abatement costs will abate more and sell their surplus permits, while sectors with high abatement costs will abate less and buy permits. This trading ensures that all abatement is undertaken where it is cheapest, leading to the equalization of marginal abatement costs across all participating sectors: $MAC_s = p_{\theta}$ for all $s$ .

### Economy-Wide Impacts and General Equilibrium Effects

While I-O models are excellent for tracking linear flows, their assumption of fixed coefficients limits their ability to capture behavioral responses to policy. CGE models excel precisely where I-O models fall short: in modeling how price changes induce substitution in production and consumption, and how these changes reverberate through factor markets and household incomes.

#### Substitution and Income Effects

A fundamental feature of CGE models is their use of flexible functional forms, such as the Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) function, to represent production and utility. This allows for substitution between inputs. When an [energy policy](@entry_id:1124475) increases the price of energy, a CGE model captures how firms substitute away from energy towards capital and labor. An I-O model, with its fixed coefficients (an implicit elasticity of substitution of zero), cannot capture this response. Consequently, for a given energy price shock, an I-O model will predict a larger increase in production costs and final prices than a CGE model, which accounts for the cost-dampening effect of substitution .

Furthermore, any policy shock has two distinct effects on demand. The **substitution effect** arises from the change in relative prices, encouraging consumers and producers to shift away from now-pricier goods. The **income effect** arises because price changes alter the real purchasing power of agents. A CGE model, by explicitly modeling household budget constraints and firm profit functions, can disentangle these two channels. For example, removing an energy subsidy raises the effective price of energy for firms, leading them to substitute away from it. However, the removal of the subsidy also eliminates the tax needed to finance it, increasing household disposable income and boosting demand for all goods. The net effect on the economy is the sum of these competing substitution and income effects, a complex interaction that only a general equilibrium framework can fully resolve .

#### Labor Market and Distributional Incidence

A critical question for any policy is "Who wins and who loses?". CGE models, which can be disaggregated to represent multiple household groups with different income levels and consumption patterns, are the primary tool for conducting such distributional incidence analysis.

An energy tax, for instance, affects labor not just by shifting production, but also by changing the real wage. The policy-induced changes in commodity prices are aggregated into a Consumer Price Index (CPI), which reflects the cost of living for households. Even if the nominal wage, $w$, remains fixed in the short run, an increase in the CPI erodes its purchasing power. The change in the real wage, $w/CPI$, is a key measure of the policy's impact on workers. This requires linking the price propagation through the production system to the household consumption basket .

More broadly, the welfare impact of a policy is rarely uniform. Different household groups are affected differently based on their unique circumstances. For example, a low-income household that spends a large fraction of its budget on energy will be more adversely affected by an energy tax than a high-income household. CGE models capture this by defining group-specific expenditure shares. By calculating a unique cost-of-living index for each group based on their consumption basket, the model can compute welfare changes for each group, typically measured in monetary terms using Hicksian concepts like Equivalent Variation (EV) or Compensating Variation (CV). This allows policymakers to identify vulnerable groups and design compensatory measures .

#### Fiscal Interactions and Revenue Recycling

Environmental taxes and permit auctions generate substantial government revenue. The way this revenue is "recycled" back into the economy is a critical determinant of the policy's overall cost. CGE models, built upon a Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) that provides a complete snapshot of all income and expenditure flows between institutions (households, firms, government), are essential for analyzing these fiscal interactions.

A carbon tax, for example, creates a new revenue stream. This revenue can be used in various ways: returned to households as a lump-sum transfer to offset the regressive impacts of the tax; used to fund [public goods](@entry_id:183902); or used to reduce other, pre-existing taxes that distort economic activity, such as taxes on labor or capital. Using carbon revenues to lower distortionary taxes can, in theory, produce a "double dividend": a cleaner environment and a more efficient economy. Evaluating such scenarios requires a model that consistently accounts for the government's budget, ensuring that total revenues equal total outlays under the new policy regime. This allows for the calculation of the new, budget-neutral tax rates on, for example, labor, after a portion of the carbon revenue is dedicated to this purpose .

### Advanced Topics and Interdisciplinary Linkages

The versatility of the CGE framework allows for numerous extensions to address more complex, dynamic, and interdisciplinary questions that lie at the frontier of policy analysis.

#### International Trade and Competitiveness

In a globalized economy, domestic [environmental policy](@entry_id:200785) cannot be analyzed in isolation. A key concern is "[carbon leakage](@entry_id:1122073)," where stringent domestic policy leads energy-intensive industries to relocate to jurisdictions with laxer regulations, resulting in no net decrease in global emissions. One proposed policy to counter this is a Border Carbon Adjustment (BCA), which is essentially a tariff on the embodied carbon of imported goods.

Modeling BCAs is a complex CGE application that links domestic economics with international trade theory. It typically involves several steps: first, using a foreign I-O table to calculate the total embodied emissions in imported goods, similar to the domestic footprint analysis. Second, applying a tariff to these imports based on the domestic [carbon price](@entry_id:1122074), $t_i = p_C \cdot e_i^{\text{F}}$, where $e_i^{\text{F}}$ is the embodied carbon content of the foreign good. Third, modeling the trade response using an Armington structure, a nested CES function that treats domestic and imported goods as imperfect substitutes. Finally, the model must account for the disposition of the tariff revenue, which is typically rebated to households, adding another income effect to the analysis .

#### Dynamics: Technological Change and Capital Accumulation

Many of the most important energy and climate questions are long-term in nature, requiring models that can project economic evolution over decades. This necessitates moving from static to dynamic CGE models. Two key dynamic elements are technological change and capital accumulation.

Technological progress is not a black box. In CGE models, it can be represented as an **Autonomous Energy Efficiency Improvement (AEEI)**, a parameter that exogenously improves the productivity of energy inputs over time. An AEEI parameter, often formulated as $A_E(t) = A_E(0)\exp(\gamma t)$, effectively lowers the price of energy services, inducing substitution and reducing energy demand for a given level of output. The rate of improvement, $\gamma$, can be calibrated by using the model's own structure and principles of economic duality to replicate observed historical trends in energy intensity .

The engine of long-term growth is **capital accumulation**. Recursive dynamic CGE models capture this process by solving for a series of sequential equilibria, linked through the accumulation of capital stock. In each period, the capital stock is determined by the previous period's stock, net of depreciation, plus new investment: $K_{t+1} = (1 - \delta)K_t + I_t$. The aggregate level of investment, $I_t$, is determined by the total pool of savings in the economy. In a common "savings-driven" closure, total investment is set equal to the sum of savings from households, the government, and the rest of the world ($I_t = S^H_t + S^G_t + S^{ROW}_t$). This aggregate investment is then allocated among sectors, typically in response to sector-specific rates of return, with more profitable sectors attracting more investment .

#### Hybrid Modeling: Bridging Top-Down and Bottom-Up Approaches

Perhaps the most significant interdisciplinary connection for energy-[economic modeling](@entry_id:144051) is the linkage between "top-down" macroeconomic models like CGE and "bottom-up" engineering-based models of specific sectors, particularly the power sector.

Top-down models excel at capturing economy-wide behavioral responses and ensuring macroeconomic consistency, but they represent technology in a highly aggregated and abstract manner (e.g., using smooth production functions). Bottom-up models, in contrast, offer rich, explicit detail on specific technologies, their costs, performance characteristics, and system-level engineering constraints (e.g., power plant [ramping limits](@entry_id:1130533), [transmission congestion](@entry_id:1133363), grid stability requirements). However, they typically take energy demand as an exogenous input and ignore feedbacks with the wider economy .

For policy questions that depend on both macroeconomic feedbacks and technological feasibility—such as assessing the long-run welfare impact of a carbon tax while ensuring the power grid remains reliable—neither model type is sufficient on its own. The solution is to build a **hybrid modeling architecture** that links them . The most common and scientifically robust method for this is an iterative "soft-coupling" procedure. This process seeks to find a consistent equilibrium, or fixed point, between the models.
The procedure typically works as follows:
1. The CGE model, given a trial electricity price, simulates the macro-economy and generates an endogenously determined electricity demand curve.
2. This demand curve is passed to the bottom-up power system model.
3. The power system model then solves a least-cost optimization problem to determine the optimal mix of technologies (investment and dispatch) required to meet that specific demand, subject to all its detailed engineering and reliability constraints.
4. From this solution, the bottom-up model calculates the marginal cost of supplying electricity, which becomes the new electricity price.
5. This new price is passed back to the CGE model, and the process repeats.

Convergence is achieved when the price and quantity of electricity are consistent between the two models—that is, the demand generated by the CGE at a given price is precisely the quantity that the power system model can supply at that same marginal price. This iterative handshake ensures that the macroeconomic assessment is grounded in technological and engineering reality, representing a powerful synthesis of economic and engineering perspectives .

### Conclusion

As this chapter has demonstrated, Computable General Equilibrium and Input-Output models are far more than theoretical constructs. They are indispensable tools in the modern policy analyst's toolkit, providing a rigorous and integrated framework for evaluating the multifaceted impacts of economic, energy, and environmental policies. From quantifying the carbon footprint of consumption and analyzing the distributional effects of a tax, to modeling international trade measures and integrating with detailed engineering models, the applications are as diverse as the policy challenges we face. By grounding policy analysis in the fundamental principles of [economic equilibrium](@entry_id:138068), these models enable a more holistic and nuanced understanding of the interconnected systems that shape our world.
