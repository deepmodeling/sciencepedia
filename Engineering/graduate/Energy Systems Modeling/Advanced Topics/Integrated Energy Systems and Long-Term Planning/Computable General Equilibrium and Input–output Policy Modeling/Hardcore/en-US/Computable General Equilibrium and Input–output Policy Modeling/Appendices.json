            "solution": "The problem presents a standard Leontief Input-Output (IO) model for a $2$-sector economy. The problem statement has been validated and found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, complete, and consistent. The tasks will be addressed sequentially.\n\nThe fundamental IO accounting identity states that the total gross output of an economy is equal to the sum of intermediate demand and final demand. This can be expressed in matrix form as:\n$$\nx = Ax + y\n$$\nwhere $x$ is the gross output vector, $A$ is the matrix of technical coefficients, and $y$ is the final demand vector.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of a closed-form expression for $x$ and its condition for existence.**\n\nWe begin with the IO accounting identity:\n$$\nx = Ax + y\n$$\nTo solve for the gross output vector $x$, we rearrange the equation by bringing all terms involving $x$ to one side:\n$$\nx - Ax = y\n$$\nFactoring out the vector $x$ using the properties of matrix algebra, where $I$ is the identity matrix of the same dimension as $A$:\n$$\nIx - Ax = y\n$$\n$$\n(I - A)x = y\n$$\nThe matrix $(I - A)$ is known as the Leontief matrix. To isolate $x$, we can pre-multiply both sides by the inverse of the Leontief matrix, $(I - A)^{-1}$, provided that this inverse exists.\n$$\n(I - A)^{-1}(I - A)x = (I - A)^{-1}y\n$$\nThis simplifies to the closed-form expression for the gross output vector:\n$$\nx = (I - A)^{-1}y\n$$\nA sufficient condition for this expression to be well-defined and for a unique solution for $x$ to exist is that the Leontief matrix $(I - A)$ must be non-singular, which means it must be invertible. This is equivalent to the condition that its determinant is non-zero:\n$$\n\\det(I - A) \\neq 0\n$$\nIn the context of IO analysis, for the solution to be economically meaningful (i.e., non-negative output for any non-negative final demand), the Hawkins-Simon condition must be satisfied. This condition requires that all principal minors of the matrix $(I-A)$ are positive. For a $2 \\times 2$ matrix, this implies that the diagonal elements of $(I-A)$ must be positive and its determinant must be positive.\n\n**Task 2: Computation of $(I - A)^{-1}$ and the gross output vector $x$.**\n\nGiven the matrix of technical coefficients:\n$$\nA = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.25 & 0.10 \\\\ 0.20 & 0.30 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFirst, we compute the Leontief matrix, $(I - A)$:\n$$\nI - A = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} - \\begin{pmatrix} 0.25 & 0.10 \\\\ 0.20 & 0.30 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1-0.25 & -0.10 \\\\ -0.20 & 1-0.30 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0.75 & -0.10 \\\\ -0.20 & 0.70 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we compute the determinant of $(I - A)$:\n$$\n\\det(I - A) = (0.75)(0.70) - (-0.10)(-0.20) = 0.525 - 0.02 = 0.505\n$$\nSince $\\det(I - A) = 0.505 \\neq 0$, the matrix is invertible. The inverse of a general $2 \\times 2$ matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{pmatrix}$ is $\\frac{1}{ad-bc} \\begin{pmatrix} d & -b \\\\ -c & a \\end{pmatrix}$. Applying this formula:\n$$\n(I - A)^{-1} = \\frac{1}{0.505} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.70 & 0.10 \\\\ 0.20 & 0.75 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nTo express this with exact fractions, we note that $0.505 = \\frac{505}{1000} = \\frac{101}{200}$. Thus, $\\frac{1}{0.505} = \\frac{200}{101}$.\n$$\n(I - A)^{-1} = \\frac{200}{101} \\begin{pmatrix} 0.70 & 0.10 \\\\ 0.20 & 0.75 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{200 \\times 0.70}{101} & \\frac{200 \\times 0.10}{101} \\\\ \\frac{200 \\times 0.20}{101} & \\frac{200 \\times 0.75}{101} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{140}{101} & \\frac{20}{101} \\\\ \\frac{40}{101} & \\frac{150}{101} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we compute the gross output vector $x$ using the given final demand vector $y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 101 \\end{pmatrix}$:\n$$\nx = (I - A)^{-1}y = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{140}{101} & \\frac{20}{101} \\\\ \\frac{40}{101} & \\frac{150}{101} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 101 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\nx = \\begin{pmatrix} (\\frac{140}{101})(0) + (\\frac{20}{101})(101) \\\\ (\\frac{40}{101})(0) + (\\frac{150}{101})(101) \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 + 20 \\\\ 0 + 150 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 20 \\\\ 150 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThus, the gross output vector is $x = \\begin{pmatrix} 20 \\\\ 150 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\n**Task 3: Interpretation of the entries of $(I - A)^{-1}$.**\n\nThe matrix $(I - A)^{-1}$, known as the Leontief inverse or the total requirements matrix, quantifies the total output required from each sector to deliver one unit of output to final demand. Let $L^{-1} = (I - A)^{-1}$. The entry $L^{-1}_{ij}$ represents the total gross output from sector $i$ required, both directly and indirectly, to satisfy one unit of final demand for the products of sector $j$.\n\nThe computed total requirements matrix is:\n$$\n(I - A)^{-1} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{140}{101} & \\frac{20}{101} \\\\ \\frac{40}{101} & \\frac{150}{101} \\end{pmatrix} \\approx \\begin{pmatrix} 1.3861 & 0.1980 \\\\ 0.3960 & 1.4851 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe interpretation of each entry is as follows:\n- $L^{-1}_{11} \\approx 1.3861$: To deliver one unit (e.g., $1$ billion dollars) of output from the energy sector to final demand, a total of approximately $1.3861$ units of gross output are required from the energy sector itself. This includes the one unit for final demand plus the $0.3861$ units required as intermediate inputs throughout the production chain.\n- $L^{-1}_{12} \\approx 0.1980$: To deliver one unit of output from the non-energy sector to final demand, a total of approximately $0.1980$ units of gross output are required from the energy sector as an indirect input. This reflects the energy intensity of the non-energy sector.\n- $L^{-1}_{21} \\approx 0.3960$: To deliver one unit of output from the energy sector to final demand, a total of approximately $0.3960$ units of gross output are required from the non-energy sector as indirect inputs.\n- $L^{-1}_{22} \\approx 1.4851$: To deliver one unit of output from the non-energy sector to final demand, a total of approximately $1.4851$ units of gross output are required from the non-energy sector itself.\n\nThese are multipliers that capture the full ripple effect of a change in final demand throughout the economy.\n\n**Task 4: Energy sector's gross output $x_{\\text{energy}}$.**\n\nThe energy sector is designated as the first sector. Therefore, its gross output is the first component of the vector $x$, denoted as $x_{\\text{energy}}$ or $x_1$. From the calculation in Task 2:\n$$\nx = \\begin{pmatrix} x_{\\text{energy}} \\\\ x_{\\text{non-energy}} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 20 \\\\ 150 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nSo, the energy sector's gross output is exactly $20$.\nThe units are specified as billion $2015$ United States dollars. Therefore, $x_{\\text{energy}} = 20$ billion $2015$ United States dollars.\nThe problem requires the answer to be reported as a single number rounded to four significant figures. The exact value is $20$. To express this with four significant figures, we write it as $20.00$.",

            "problem": "You are asked to implement and solve a small, price-side Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model for energy systems using the Input–Output price model to trace the incidence of a carbon tax under alternative macroeconomic closures. Your task is to compute the adjustments in real wages, real capital returns, and real consumption for a representative household when a per-unit carbon tax is applied to the energy sector, under three distinct closures.\n\nThe model has two production sectors: energy and non-energy. Let there be an Input–Output technical coefficient matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2 \\times 2}$ with sectors ordered as energy (index $E$) and non-energy (index $N$). The price-side Leontief system is built on the fundamental Input–Output identity that equates unit prices to the sum of value-added and intermediate input costs. The following fundamental definitions and identities apply:\n\n- The Input–Output price identity is $p = v + A^{\\top} p$, where $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is the sectoral price vector and $v \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is the value-added plus tax component vector. Solving for prices gives the Leontief inverse form $p = (I - A^{\\top})^{-1} v$, where $I$ is the identity matrix.\n- The value-added in sector $i \\in \\{E,N\\}$ is a linear combination of factor payments and policy taxes:\n  $$v_i = s^L_i \\, w + s^K_i \\, r + \\tau_i,$$\n  where $s^L_i$ and $s^K_i$ are value-added shares to labor and capital in sector $i$, $w$ is the nominal wage rate, $r$ is the nominal capital return rate, and $\\tau_i$ is the per-unit tax applied to sector $i$ (only the energy sector has a carbon tax).\n- The household forms a consumption price index (Consumer Price Index (CPI)) as a linear price aggregator:\n  $$\\mathrm{CPI}(p) = \\beta_E \\, p_E + \\beta_N \\, p_N,$$\n  with budget shares $\\beta_E$ and $\\beta_N$ satisfying $\\beta_E + \\beta_N = 1$.\n- The representative household has fixed endowments of labor and capital, denoted $L$ and $K$, with nominal income\n  $$Y = w \\, L + r \\, K.$$\n- Under Cobb–Douglas preferences, the household’s consumption of sector $i$ is\n  $$c_i = \\frac{\\beta_i \\, Y}{p_i},$$\n  and a real consumption index proportional to the utility aggregator can be measured by $Y/\\mathrm{CPI}$.\n\nThe energy sector is subject to a per-unit carbon tax given by\n$$\\tau_E = t \\cdot m_E,$$\nwhere $t$ is the carbon tax rate expressed in currency units per unit of emissions and $m_E$ is the emissions intensity per unit of energy output. The non-energy sector has no carbon tax, so $\\tau_N = 0$.\n\nYou must analyze how different closures alter the incidence of the carbon tax by solving for $(w,r)$ under each closure, computing prices, and then measuring changes in real wages $w/\\mathrm{CPI}$, real capital returns $r/\\mathrm{CPI}$, and real consumption $Y/\\mathrm{CPI}$ relative to a baseline without the carbon tax. Each closure imposes a second macroeconomic condition that pin down $(w,r)$ together with the choice of numeraire.

            "problem": "Consider a closed, static, two-sector energy-economy with a representative household, two primary factors, and ad valorem taxes. Sector $\\mathsf{E}$ produces the energy good, and sector $\\mathsf{M}$ produces the manufacturing good. There are two primary factors: labor $\\mathsf{L}$ and capital $\\mathsf{K}$ with fixed aggregate endowments $\\bar{L}$ and $\\bar{K}$. The representative household supplies $\\bar{L}$ and $\\bar{K}$ inelastically, receives all tax revenue as a lump-sum transfer, and has Cobb–Douglas preferences over final consumption.\n\nTechnologies are constant returns to scale and described by Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) value-added production functions. For each sector $i \\in \\{\\mathsf{E}, \\mathsf{M}\\}$, the production function is\n$$\ny_i = A_i \\left[a_i L_i^{\\frac{\\sigma_i - 1}{\\sigma_i}} + (1 - a_i) K_i^{\\frac{\\sigma_i - 1}{\\sigma_i}}\\right]^{\\frac{\\sigma_i}{\\sigma_i - 1}},\n$$\nwhere $A_i > 0$ is a productivity parameter, $a_i \\in (0,1)$ is the labor share parameter, and $\\sigma_i > 0$ is the elasticity of substitution. The dual unit cost function under competitive factor pricing with wage $w$ and rental rate $r$ is, for $\\sigma_i \\neq 1$,\n$$\nc_i(w,r) = \\frac{1}{A_i}\\left[a_i w^{1 - \\sigma_i} + (1 - a_i) r^{1 - \\sigma_i}\\right]^{\\frac{1}{1 - \\sigma_i}}.\n$$\nIn the Cobb–Douglas limit $\\sigma_i = 1$, the unit cost function is\n$$\nc_i(w,r) = \\frac{1}{A_i} w^{a_i} r^{1 - a_i}.\n$$\n\nTaxes are ad valorem. There is a consumption tax on energy at rate $\\tau_{\\mathsf{cE}} \\ge 0$ and an output tax on manufacturing at rate $\\tau_{\\mathsf{oM}} \\ge 0$. All tax rates must be expressed as decimal fractions (for example, a $10\\%$ tax is entered as $0.10$).\n\nLet $p_{\\mathsf{E}}$ denote the consumer price of energy and $p_{\\mathsf{M}}$ the consumer price of manufacturing. Normalize $p_{\\mathsf{M}} = 1$. Producers in energy receive the net-of-consumption-tax price $p_{\\mathsf{E}}^{p} = \\frac{p_{\\mathsf{E}}}{1 + \\tau_{\\mathsf{cE}}}$, and producers in manufacturing receive the net-of-output-tax price $p_{\\mathsf{M}}^{p} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\tau_{\\mathsf{oM}}}$. Under perfect competition and constant returns to scale, zero-profit conditions require\n$$\nc_{\\mathsf{E}}(w,r) = \\frac{p_{\\mathsf{E}}}{1 + \\tau_{\\mathsf{cE}}}, \\quad c_{\\mathsf{M}}(w,r) = \\frac{1}{1 + \\tau_{\\mathsf{oM}}}.\n$$\n\nBy Shephard’s lemma, the input demands per unit of output for sector $i$ are given by $L_{i}^{\\text{unit}} = \\frac{\\partial c_i}{\\partial w}$ and $K_{i}^{\\text{unit}} = \\frac{\\partial c_i}{\\partial r}$. For $\\sigma_i \\neq 1$, these are\n$$\nL_{i}^{\\text{unit}}(w,r) = \\frac{1}{A_i} a_i \\left[a_i w^{1 - \\sigma_i} + (1 - a_i) r^{1 - \\sigma_i}\\right]^{\\frac{\\sigma_i}{1 - \\sigma_i}} w^{-\\sigma_i},\n$$\n$$\nK_{i}^{\\text{unit}}(w,r) = \\frac{1}{A_i} (1 - a_i) \\left[a_i w^{1 - \\sigma_i} + (1 - a_i) r^{1 - \\sigma_i}\\right]^{\\frac{\\sigma_i}{1 - \\sigma_i}} r^{-\\sigma_i}.\n$$\nIn the Cobb–Douglas limit $\\sigma_i = 1$, the unit input demands are\n$$\nL_{i}^{\\text{unit}}(w,r) = \\frac{a_i}{A_i} \\frac{w^{a_i} r^{1 - a_i}}{w}, \\quad K_{i}^{\\text{unit}}(w,r) = \\frac{1 - a_i}{A_i} \\frac{w^{a_i} r^{1 - a_i}}{r}.\n$$\n\nThe representative household has Cobb–Douglas utility $U(c_{\\mathsf{E}}, c_{\\mathsf{M}}) = c_{\\mathsf{E}}^{\\beta} c_{\\mathsf{M}}^{1 - \\beta}$ for $\\beta \\in (0,1)$ and faces consumer prices $p_{\\mathsf{E}}$ and $p_{\\mathsf{M}} = 1$, choosing expenditures that are constant shares of income $Y$:\n$$\np_{\\mathsf{E}} c_{\\mathsf{E}} = \\beta Y, \\quad c_{\\mathsf{M}} = (1 - \\beta) Y.\n$$\nTotal income is factor income plus tax revenue rebated lump-sum:\n$$\nY = w \\bar{L} + r \\bar{K} + \\underbrace{\\frac{\\tau_{\\mathsf{cE}}}{1 + \\tau_{\\mathsf{cE}}} p_{\\mathsf{E}} c_{\\mathsf{E}}}_{\\text{energy consumption tax revenue}} + \\underbrace{\\frac{\\tau_{\\mathsf{oM}}}{1 + \\tau_{\\mathsf{oM}}} \\cdot 1 \\cdot q_{\\mathsf{M}}}_{\\text{manufacturing output tax revenue}},\n$$\nwhere $q_{\\mathsf{M}}$ is manufacturing output. Market clearing for goods requires $q_{\\mathsf{E}} = c_{\\mathsf{E}}$ and $q_{\\mathsf{M}} = c_{\\mathsf{M}}$. Market clearing for factors requires $L_{\\mathsf{E}} + L_{\\mathsf{M}} = \\bar{L}$ and $K_{\\mathsf{E}} + K_{\\mathsf{M}} = \\bar{K}$, with $L_i = q_i L_{i}^{\\text{unit}}(w,r)$ and $K_i = q_i K_{i}^{\\text{unit}}(w,r)$.\n\nYour program must compute a competitive general equilibrium that simultaneously satisfies:\n- Zero-profit conditions for both sectors,\n- Market clearing for both goods and both factors,\n- The representative household’s income balance (total spending equals total income at consumer prices).\n\nTo compute equilibrium, treat $p_{\\mathsf{E}}$ as an unknown. For any guess of $p_{\\mathsf{E}}$, solve the two zero-profit conditions for $(w,r)$, then solve the $2 \\times 2$ linear system implied by factor market clearing to obtain $(q_{\\mathsf{E}}, q_{\\mathsf{M}})$. Using the household’s expenditure rules, compute the implied $p_{\\mathsf{E}}^{*} = \\frac{\\beta Y}{q_{\\mathsf{E}}}$. At equilibrium, consistency requires $p_{\\mathsf{E}} = p_{\\mathsf{E}}^{*}$. Use a fixed-point iteration or root-finding to enforce $p_{\\mathsf{E}} = p_{\\mathsf{E}}^{*}$.\n\nImplement numerical tolerances as follows: a condition is considered satisfied if the absolute value of its residual is less than $\\varepsilon = 10^{-8}$.\n\nDesign your solution to produce boolean verification results for three conditions per test case: goods and factor market clearing, zero-profit, and income balance. For each test case, output a list $[b_{\\text{mc}}, b_{\\text{zp}}, b_{\\text{ib}}]$ where each entry is either $\\mathsf{True}$ or $\\mathsf{False}$ depending on whether the condition is satisfied within tolerance.\n\nTest Suite:\n- Case $1$ (baseline):\n  - Sector $\\mathsf{E}$: $A_{\\mathsf{E}} = 1.0$, $a_{\\mathsf{E}} = 0.6$, $\\sigma_{\\mathsf{E}} = 0.8$, $\\tau_{\\mathsf{cE}} = 0.2$.\n  - Sector $\\mathsf{M}$: $A_{\\mathsf{M}} = 1.0$, $a_{\\mathsf{M}} = 0.5$, $\\sigma_{\\mathsf{M}} = 0.7$, $\\tau_{\\mathsf{oM}} = 0.1$.\n  - Endowments: $\\bar{L} = 100.0$, $\\bar{K} = 80.0$.\n  - Preferences: $\\beta = 0.4$.\n- Case $2$ (high energy tax boundary):\n  - Sector $\\mathsf{E}$: $A_{\\mathsf{E}} = 0.9$, $a_{\\mathsf{E}} = 0.5$, $\\sigma_{\\mathsf{E}} = 0.6$, $\\tau_{\\mathsf{cE}} = 1.0$.\n  - Sector $\\mathsf{M}$: $A_{\\mathsf{M}} = 1.1$, $a_{\\mathsf{M}} = 0.4$, $\\sigma_{\\mathsf{M}} = 0.5$, $\\tau_{\\mathsf{oM}} = 0.0$.\n  - Endowments: $\\bar{L} = 90.0$, $\\bar{K} = 90.0$.\n  - Preferences: $\\beta = 0.5$.\n- Case $3$ (Cobb–Douglas limit in manufacturing):\n  - Sector $\\mathsf{E}$: $A_{\\mathsf{E}} = 1.2$, $a_{\\mathsf{E}} = 0.7$, $\\sigma_{\\mathsf{E}} = 0.3$, $\\tau_{\\mathsf{cE}} = 0.0$.\n  - Sector $\\mathsf{M}$: $A_{\\mathsf{M}} = 0.95$, $a_{\\mathsf{M}} = 0.5$, $\\sigma_{\\mathsf{M}} = 1.0$, $\\tau_{\\mathsf{oM}} = 0.25$.\n  - Endowments: $\\bar{L} = 110.0$, $\\bar{K} = 70.0$.\n  - Preferences: $\\beta = 0.6$.\n\nFinal Output Format:\nYour program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each element corresponds to a test case result list. For example, the output must look like\n$$\n\\texttt{[[True,True,True],[True,True,True],[True,True,True]]}.\n$$",

The use of CES production functions, Cobb-Douglas utility, perfect competition, and market-clearing conditions are fundamental concepts in this field. All equations are standard representations. The model is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. By fixing one price as the numeraire ($p_{\\mathsf{M}} = 1$), and noting that Walras's Law makes one market-clearing condition redundant, the system has a determinate number of equations and unknowns. The problem statement guides the user to a standard solution algorithm (tâtonnement on one price), which is known to converge for such models under reasonable conditions. The existence of a unique equilibrium is generally expected.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, mathematical language. It is free of ambiguity, subjectivity, or opinion.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: All necessary parameters and functional forms are provided for each test case. There are no apparent contradictions in the model setup. The relationship between consumer and producer prices, taxes, and revenue is specified consistently.\n- **Feasibility and Realism**: The parameters are within plausible ranges for economic models. No physical or scientific impossibilities are introduced.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a complete, consistent, and scientifically sound problem in computational economics. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core of the problem is to find a vector of prices $(p_{\\mathsf{E}}, w, r)$ and quantities $(q_{\\mathsf{E}}, q_{\\mathsf{M}})$ that simultaneously satisfies all equilibrium conditions. Following the problem's guidance, we select the price of the manufacturing good as the numeraire, $p_{\\mathsf{M}}=1$. By Walras's Law, if all but one market are in equilibrium, the last one must also be. This allows us to solve the system by finding the single relative price, $p_{\\mathsf{E}}$, that brings the economy into equilibrium.\n\nThe solution is found via a root-finding algorithm. We define a residual function $f(p_{\\mathsf{E}}) = p_{\\mathsf{E}}^{\\text{guess}} - p_{\\mathsf{E}}^{\\text{implied}}$, where an equilibrium is a root $p_{\\mathsf{E}}^{eq}$ such that $f(p_{\\mathsf{E}}^{eq})=0$. The calculation of $p_{\\mathsf{E}}^{\\text{implied}}$ for a given $p_{\\mathsf{E}}^{\\text{guess}}$ proceeds as follows:\n\n1.  **Solve for Factor Prices $(w,r)$**: Given a guess for $p_{\\mathsf{E}}$, the producer prices $p_{\\mathsf{E}}^{p} = p_{\\mathsf{E}}/(1+\\tau_{\\mathsf{cE}})$ and $p_{\\mathsf{M}}^{p} = 1/(1+\\tau_{\\mathsf{oM}})$ are determined. The two zero-profit conditions, $c_{\\mathsf{E}}(w,r)=p_{\\mathsf{E}}^p$ and $c_{\\mathsf{M}}(w,r)=p_{\\mathsf{M}}^p$, form a system of two non-linear equations in the factor prices $(w,r)$. We can simplify this system by taking their ratio:\n    $$\n    \\frac{c_{\\mathsf{E}}(w,r)}{c_{\\mathsf{M}}(w,r)} = \\frac{p_{\\mathsf{E}}^{p}}{p_{\\mathsf{M}}^{p}}\n    $$\n    Since the cost functions are homogeneous of degree one in prices, this ratio depends only on the wage-rental ratio $\\omega = w/r$.\n    $$\n    \\frac{c_{\\mathsf{E}}(\\omega,1)}{c_{\\mathsf{M}}(\\omega,1)} = \\frac{p_{\\mathsf{E}}^{p}}{p_{\\mathsf{M}}^{p}} \\implies \\frac{c_{\\mathsf{E}}(\\omega,1)}{c_{\\mathsf{M}}(\\omega,1)} - \\frac{p_{\\mathsf{E}} (1+\\tau_{\\mathsf{oM}})}{(1+\\tau_{\\mathsf{cE}})} = 0\n    $$\n    This is a single non-linear equation in $\\omega$, which can be solved efficiently using a numerical root-finder. Once $\\omega$ is found, we can solve for $r$ using the second zero-profit condition: $c_{\\mathsf{M}}(w,r) = r \\cdot c_{\\mathsf{M}}(\\omega,1) = p_{\\mathsf{M}}^{p}$, which yields $r = p_{\\mathsf{M}}^{p} / c_{\\mathsf{M}}(\\omega,1)$. Finally, $w = \\omega r$.\n\n2.  **Calculate Unit Factor Demands**: With the equilibrium factor prices $(w,r)$ determined, we can calculate the unit factor demands $L_i^{\\text{unit}}$ and $K_i^{\\text{unit}}$ for each sector $i \\in \\{\\mathsf{E}, \\mathsf{M}\\}$ using the provided formulas, carefully handling the special case where $\\sigma_i = 1$.\n\n3.  **Solve for Sector Outputs $(q_{\\mathsf{E}}, q_{\\mathsf{M}})$**: The factor market clearing conditions, $L_{\\mathsf{E}}^{\\text{unit}} q_{\\mathsf{E}} + L_{\\mathsf{M}}^{\\text{unit}} q_{\\mathsf{M}} = \\bar{L}$ and $K_{\\mathsf{E}}^{\\text{unit}} q_{\\mathsf{E}} + K_{\\mathsf{M}}^{\\text{unit}} q_{\\mathsf{M}} = \\bar{K}$, form a $2 \\times 2$ system of linear equations for the sectoral outputs $(q_{\\mathsf{E}}, q_{\\mathsf{M}})$. This system is solved using standard linear algebra.\n\n4.  **Calculate Implied Energy Price $p_{\\mathsf{E}}^*$**: We calculate the household's total income $Y$, which is the sum of factor income and rebated tax revenues.\n    $$\n    Y = w \\bar{L} + r \\bar{K} + \\tau_{\\mathsf{cE}} p_{\\mathsf{E}}^{p} q_{\\mathsf{E}} + \\tau_{\\mathsf{oM}} p_{\\mathsf{M}}^{p} q_{\\mathsf{M}}\n    $$\n    The household's Cobb-Douglas preferences mean it spends a constant fraction $\\beta$ of its income on the energy good: $p_{\\mathsf{E}} c_{\\mathsf{E}} = \\beta Y$. Assuming goods market clearing ($q_{\\mathsf{E}} = c_{\\mathsf{E}}$), this expenditure rule implies a market-clearing price for energy:\n    $$\n    p_{\\mathsf{E}}^{*} = \\frac{\\beta Y}{q_{\\mathsf{E}}}\n    $$\n    This is the implied price consistent with the guess $p_{\\mathsf{E}}^{\\text{guess}}$.\n\n5.  **Find Equilibrium**: The residual function is $f(p_{\\mathsf{E}}) = p_{\\mathsf{E}}^{\\text{guess}} - p_{\\mathsf{E}}^*$. We use a root-finding algorithm (from `scipy.optimize`) to find the equilibrium price $p_{\\mathsf{E}}^{eq}$ where $f(p_{\\mathsf{E}}^{eq}) = 0$.\n\n6.  **Verification**: Once the equilibrium price $p_{\\mathsf{E}}^{eq}$ is found, all other equilibrium quantities are recalculated. We then verify that the defining conditions of the equilibrium hold to within the specified tolerance $\\varepsilon = 10^{-8}$:\n    - **Market Clearing ($b_{\\text{mc}}$)**: Residuals for the two factor markets are checked.\n    - **Zero Profit ($b_{\\text{zp}}$)**: Residuals for the two zero-profit conditions are checked.\n    - **Income Balance ($b_{\\text{ib}}$)**: The residual for household income equaling household expenditure ($Y = p_{\\mathsf{E}}q_{\\mathsf{E}} + p_{\\mathsf{M}}q_{\\mathsf{M}}$) is checked. This is an implication of Walras's Law and a check on the overall consistency of the computed solution.\n\nThis algorithm will be implemented for each of the three test cases provided.",
