This exercise guides you through deriving this price—the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE)—from the fundamental principle of setting the Net Present Value (NPV) to zero. Mastering this calculation () is essential, as the LCOE establishes the absolute price floor below which a rational bidder will not go, forming the foundation of any auction strategy.",

            "problem": "A developer participating in a sealed-bid, pay-as-bid renewable energy auction must choose a constant real bid price per megawatt-hour that makes the project just break even in net present value. Assume the project has a single upfront capital expenditure of amount $I_{0}$ at time $t = 0$, delivers a constant expected annual energy output of $E$ for $N$ years starting at $t = 1$, and incurs a constant real fixed annual operation and maintenance cost of $O$ over the same $N$ years. Let the developer’s real Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) be $r$, and assume no escalation, no variable operation and maintenance costs, no curtailment, no subsidies, no tax effects, and zero salvage value at the end of life. The bidder’s break-even bid is the constant real price $p^{\\ast}$ (in currency per megawatt-hour) such that the net present value of discounted net cash flows is zero when discounted at the real WACC.\n\nStarting from the definition of net present value and the time value of money, derive an analytical expression for $p^{\\ast}$ in terms of $I_{0}$, $r$, $O$, $E$, and $N$. Then compute $p^{\\ast}$ for the following scientifically plausible numerical example that characterizes a utility-scale onshore wind farm:\n\n- Upfront capital expenditure: $I_{0} = \\$\\,150{,}000{,}000$ (United States dollars).\n- Real Weighted Average Cost of Capital: $r = 0.06$.\n- Fixed annual operation and maintenance cost: $O = \\$\\,4{,}000{,}000$ per year.\n- Expected annual energy output: $E = 350{,}400$ megawatt-hours per year.\n- Economic life: $N = 25$ years.\n\nExpress the final bid $p^{\\ast}$ in United States dollars per megawatt-hour (USD/MWh). Round your answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of an analytical expression for the break-even bid price, $p^{\\ast}$, and its numerical calculation for a given set of parameters. The break-even condition is defined as the price at which the net present value (NPV) of all project cash flows is zero.\n\nFirst, we establish the cash flows for the project over its lifetime.\nThe initial capital expenditure at time $t=0$ is an outflow of $I_{0}$. The cash flow at $t=0$ is $CF_{0} = -I_{0}$.\nFor each year $t$ from $t=1$ to $t=N$, the project generates revenue and incurs operation and maintenance (O&M) costs.\nThe annual revenue is the product of the constant real price $p^{\\ast}$ and the constant expected annual energy output $E$. Thus, the annual revenue is $R_t = p^{\\ast} E$.\nThe annual O&M cost is given as a constant real value $O$.\nThe net cash flow for any year $t$ in the operational period ($1 \\le t \\le N$) is constant and given by:\n$$CF_t = R_t - O = p^{\\ast}E - O \\quad \\text{for } t=1, 2, \\dots, N$$\n\nThe Net Present Value (NPV) of the project is the sum of all discounted cash flows over the project's life, from $t=0$ to $t=N$. The discount rate is the real Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), denoted by $r$. The general formula for NPV is:\n$$NPV = \\sum_{t=0}^{N} \\frac{CF_t}{(1+r)^t}$$\nSubstituting the specific cash flows for this project:\n$$NPV = CF_0 + \\sum_{t=1}^{N} \\frac{CF_t}{(1+r)^t} = -I_0 + \\sum_{t=1}^{N} \\frac{p^{\\ast}E - O}{(1+r)^t}$$\nThe break-even condition requires that $NPV = 0$.\n$$0 = -I_0 + \\sum_{t=1}^{N} \\frac{p^{\\ast}E - O}{(1+r)^t}$$\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for $p^{\\ast}$:\n$$I_0 = \\sum_{t=1}^{N} \\frac{p^{\\ast}E - O}{(1+r)^t}$$\nSince the annual net cash flow term $(p^{\\ast}E - O)$ is constant for all years $t=1, \\dots, N$, it can be factored out of the summation:\n$$I_0 = (p^{\\ast}E - O) \\sum_{t=1}^{N} \\frac{1}{(1+r)^t}$$\nThe summation term is a finite geometric series with first term $a = \\frac{1}{1+r}$, common ratio $q = \\frac{1}{1+r}$, and $N$ terms. The sum of a finite geometric series is given by $S_N = a \\frac{1-q^N}{1-q}$.\nApplying this formula to our summation:\n$$\\sum_{t=1}^{N} \\left(\\frac{1}{1+r}\\right)^t = \\frac{1}{1+r} \\frac{1 - \\left(\\frac{1}{1+r}\\right)^N}{1 - \\frac{1}{1+r}} = \\frac{1}{1+r} \\frac{1 - (1+r)^{-N}}{\\frac{1+r-1}{1+r}} = \\frac{1-(1+r)^{-N}}{r}$$\nThis expression is the Present Value Interest Factor for an Annuity (PVIFA), often denoted as $A(r, N)$.\nSubstituting this back into our equation for $I_0$:\n$$I_0 = (p^{\\ast}E - O) \\left( \\frac{1-(1+r)^{-N}}{r} \\right)$$\nNow, we solve for $p^{\\ast}$. First, isolate the term $(p^{\\ast}E - O)$:\n$$p^{\\ast}E - O = I_0 \\left( \\frac{r}{1-(1+r)^{-N}} \\right)$$\nThe term $\\frac{r}{1-(1+r)^{-N}}$ is known as the Capital Recovery Factor (CRF). It annualizes the initial investment $I_0$ over $N$ years at a discount rate $r$.\nNext, we add $O$ to both sides and then divide by $E$:\n$$p^{\\ast}E = O + I_0 \\left( \\frac{r}{1-(1+r)^{-N}} \\right)$$\n$$p^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{E} \\left( O + I_0 \\frac{r}{1-(1+r)^{-N}} \\right)$$\nThis is the analytical expression for the break-even bid price $p^{\\ast}$. This expression is equivalent to the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) under the given assumptions. It represents the total annualized cost (O&M plus annualized capital cost) divided by the annual energy output.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value for $p^{\\ast}$ using the provided data:\n-   $I_{0} = 150,000,000$\n-   $r = 0.06$\n-   $O = 4,000,000$\n-   $E = 350,400$\n-   $N = 25$\n\nFirst, we calculate the term $(1+r)^{-N}$:\n$$(1+r)^{-N} = (1.06)^{-25}$$\nUsing a calculator for precision, $(1.06)^{25} \\approx 4.29187075$, so $(1.06)^{-25} \\approx 0.232997365$.\n\nNext, we calculate the Capital Recovery Factor (CRF):\n$$\\text{CRF} = \\frac{r}{1-(1+r)^{-N}} = \\frac{0.06}{1 - 0.232997365} = \\frac{0.06}{0.767002635} \\approx 0.0782268797$$\n\nNow, we can find the annualized capital cost:\n$$\\text{Annualized Capital Cost} = I_0 \\times \\text{CRF} = 150,000,000 \\times 0.0782268797 \\approx 11,734,031.95$$\nThe total annualized cost is the sum of the annualized capital cost and the annual O&M cost:\n$$\\text{Total Annualized Cost} = O + (I_0 \\times \\text{CRF}) = 4,000,000 + 11,734,031.95 = 15,734,031.95$$\nFinally, we calculate $p^{\\ast}$ by dividing the total annualized cost by the annual energy output:\n$$p^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\text{Total Annualized Cost}}{E} = \\frac{15,734,031.95}{350,400} \\approx 44.9030592$$\nThe problem requires rounding the answer to four significant figures.\n$$p^{\\ast} \\approx 44.90$$\nThe units are United States dollars per megawatt-hour (USD/MWh).",

Thus, $b(c)$ is a strictly increasing function of $c$, which confirms our initial assumption. A higher cost leads to a higher bid.\n2.  **Boundary Behavior**:\n    -   At the lower cost boundary, $c=0$, the bid is $b(0) = 0 + \\frac{1-0}{n} = \\frac{1}{n}$. A bidder with zero cost adds a markup that decreases as the number of competitors $n$ increases, reflecting increased competitive pressure. This is economically sensible.\n    -   At the upper cost boundary, $c=1$, the bid is $b(1) = 1 + \\frac{1-1}{n} = 1$. The highest-cost bidder bids their true cost, ensuring they do not make a loss in the zero-probability event that they win. This aligns with rational economic behavior.\n\nThe derived function satisfies all requirements of the problem.",

For each lot size $L$ in the test suite, we will perform the following steps:\n$1$. Check if $Q/L$ is an integer. If not, the result is $-1.0$.\n$2$. If it is, set $m = Q/L$.\n$3$. Count the number of bidders $i$ for which $K_i \\ge L$ to get $M(L)$.\n$4$. Check if $M(L) \\ge m$. If not, the result is $-1.0$.\n$5$. If both feasibility conditions are met, calculate $E[\\text{Cost}_{\\text{total}}]$ using the derived formula with the given parameters $Q, \\mathbf{K}, \\alpha, \\beta, \\tau$.",
