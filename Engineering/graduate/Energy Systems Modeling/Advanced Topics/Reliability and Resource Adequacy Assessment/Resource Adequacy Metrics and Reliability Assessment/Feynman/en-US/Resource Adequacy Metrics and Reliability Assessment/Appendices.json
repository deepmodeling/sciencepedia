This exercise provides direct practice in constructing a Capacity Outage Probability Table (COPT), which is the probability distribution of total capacity on outage.

            "problem": "A single-area power system has three generating units. Each unit is modeled as a two-state device (available or on forced outage) with independent forced outages. For a snapshot reliability assessment, assume the steady-state interpretation that the probability a unit is on forced outage equals its forced outage rate, and the probability it is available equals one minus its forced outage rate. Ignore maintenance outages and partial deratings. The units are:\n- Unit A: capacity $120~\\mathrm{MW}$, forced outage rate $0.05$.\n- Unit B: capacity $80~\\mathrm{MW}$, forced outage rate $0.10$.\n- Unit C: capacity $50~\\mathrm{MW}$, forced outage rate $0.08$.\n\nConstruct explicitly the Capacity Outage Probability Table (COPT), defined as the probability mass function over total capacity on outage (i.e., the sum of capacities of all units that are on forced outage), by enumerating all distinct outage states and their probabilities under the independence assumption. Then, for a single deterministic hourly load of $190~\\mathrm{MW}$, compute the probability that the available capacity is strictly less than the load (i.e., the one-hour loss-of-load probability). Express your final probability as a decimal (not a percentage) and round your final answer to four significant figures.",
            "solution": "Let $C_A$, $C_B$, and $C_C$ be the capacities of the three generating units, and let $p_A$, $p_B$, and $p_C$ be their respective forced outage rates (FORs).

There are $2^3 = 8$ possible system states. We enumerate them to construct the Capacity Outage Probability Table (COPT), where $C_{outage}$ is the total capacity on outage for a given state.\n\n1.  **All units available:** $C_{outage} = 0~\\mathrm{MW}$. $P = q_A q_B q_C = (0.95)(0.90)(0.92) = 0.7866$.\n2.  **Unit C on outage:** $C_{outage} = 50~\\mathrm{MW}$. $P = q_A q_B p_C = (0.95)(0.90)(0.08) = 0.0684$.\n3.  **Unit B on outage:** $C_{outage} = 80~\\mathrm{MW}$. $P = q_A p_B q_C = (0.95)(0.10)(0.92) = 0.0874$.\n4.  **Unit A on outage:** $C_{outage} = 120~\\mathrm{MW}$. $P = p_A q_B q_C = (0.05)(0.90)(0.92) = 0.0414$.\n5.  **Units B and C on outage:** $C_{outage} = 80+50 = 130~\\mathrm{MW}$. $P = q_A p_B p_C = (0.95)(0.10)(0.08) = 0.0076$.\n6.  **Units A and C on outage:** $C_{outage} = 120+50 = 170~\\mathrm{MW}$. $P = p_A q_B p_C = (0.05)(0.90)(0.08) = 0.0036$.\n7.  **Units A and B on outage:** $C_{outage} = 120+80 = 200~\\mathrm{MW}$. $P = p_A p_B q_C = (0.05)(0.10)(0.92) = 0.0046$.\n8.  **All units on outage:** $C_{outage} = 120+80+50 = 250~\\mathrm{MW}$. $P = p_A p_B p_C = (0.05)(0.10)(0.08) = 0.0004$.\n\nThe Capacity Outage Probability Table (COPT) is the probability mass function over distinct outage capacity levels:\n- $P(C_{outage} = 0~\\mathrm{MW}) = 0.7866$\n- $P(C_{outage} = 50~\\mathrm{MW}) = 0.0684$\n- $P(C_{outage} = 80~\\mathrm{MW}) = 0.0874$\n- $P(C_{outage} = 120~\\mathrm{MW}) = 0.0414$\n- $P(C_{outage} = 130~\\mathrm{MW}) = 0.0076$\n- $P(C_{outage} = 170~\\mathrm{MW}) = 0.0036$\n- $P(C_{outage} = 200~\\mathrm{MW}) = 0.0046$\n- $P(C_{outage} = 250~\\mathrm{MW}) = 0.0004$\n\nNext, we compute the loss-of-load probability (LOLP) for a load $L = 190~\\mathrm{MW}$. A loss of load occurs if the available capacity, $C_{avail}$, is strictly less than the load. Total installed capacity is $C_{total} = 120 + 80 + 50 = 250~\\mathrm{MW}$.

We sum the probabilities of all states that satisfy this condition. From the COPT, these are the states with outage capacities of $80$, $120$, $130$, $170$, $200$, and $250~\\mathrm{MW}$.\n$$LOLP = P(C_{outage} > 60~\\mathrm{MW})$$\n$$LOLP = P(C_{outage}=80) + P(C_{outage}=120) + P(C_{outage}=130) + P(C_{outage}=170) + P(C_{outage}=200) + P(C_{outage}=250)$$\nSubstituting the probabilities calculated earlier:\n$$LOLP = 0.0874 + 0.0414 + 0.0076 + 0.0036 + 0.0046 + 0.0004$$\n$$LOLP = 0.1450$$\nThe final answer is required as a decimal rounded to four significant figures.

Planning Implications**\nThe computed metrics are $\\text{LOLE} = 57.00$ hours/year and $\\text{EUE} = 13280$ MWh/year. These metrics emphasize different aspects of risk.\n- **LOLE** measures the *frequency* of shortfalls. A value of $57$ hours is very high compared to typical reliability standards (e.g., $2.4$ hours/year), indicating that the system frequently fails to meet demand.\n- **EUE** measures the *volume* or severity of shortfalls. A high EUE indicates that the total energy deficit is large.\nIn this case, the largest contribution to EUE comes from the second-highest load block ($L_2 = 1200$ MW), contributing $6240$ MWh, more than double the contribution from the absolute peak load block ($2240$ MWh). While LOLE indicates frequent problems, EUE reveals that the most significant risk in terms of energy volume comes from sustained high-load periods, not just the sharpest peaks.\n\nA planner focusing only on LOLE might prioritize adding a small amount of capacity, such as a \"peaker plant,\" to clip the highest peaks. However, the EUE result suggests that a more robust solution, such as a larger block of reliable mid-merit capacity or a long-duration demand response program, is needed to address the significant energy shortfalls during the extended periods of high load. EUE thus provides a more economically meaningful signal for investment by accounting for the severity of outages, not just their frequency.",

Let $s_{t-1}$ be the state of charge at the beginning of hour $t$. The initial state is $s_0 = 0$.\n- **t=1, 2, 3:** The net load is $N_t = 50$ MW (deficit). Since the storage starts empty ($s_0=0$) and there is no preceding surplus to charge it, it cannot discharge. Thus, $u_1=u_2=u_3=0$. The unserved energy for each of these three hours is $50$ MWh. The state of charge remains at $0$.\n- **t=4:** The net load is $N_4 = -30$ MW (surplus). We charge the storage at the maximum rate allowed by the surplus and the power limit ($P_\\mathrm{s}=30$ MW).

The total deficit is $3 \\times 50 = 150$ MWh. The total available surplus is $3 \\times 30 = 90$ MWh. The storage can provide a maximum of $E_{\\max} = 60$ MWh to reduce the deficits. To minimize unserved energy, this 60 MWh is dispatched during the three peak deficit hours.\n- We have 60 MWh to dispatch, with a power limit of 30 MW.\n- We can discharge at 30 MW for two of the deficit hours, or spread the energy across the three hours.\n- Let's discharge 30 MW in the first deficit hour and 30 MW in the second.\n- Deficit hour 1: Net load is 50 MW. Discharge $u'_1=30$ MW. Unserved energy = $50 - 30 = 20$ MWh.\n- Deficit hour 2: Net load is 50 MW. Discharge $u'_2=30$ MW. Unserved energy = $50 - 30 = 20$ MWh.\n- Deficit hour 3: Net load is 50 MW. Storage is empty. Discharge $u'_3=0$ MW.
