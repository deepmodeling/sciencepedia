            "problem": "Consider a single thermal generating unit in the Security-Constrained Unit Commitment (SCUC) framework. Let the binary commitment variable be $u_{g,t} \\in \\{0,1\\}$ for periods $t \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$, with $u_{g,t}=1$ indicating the unit is online and $u_{g,t}=0$ indicating the unit is offline. Define the start-up logical indicator $y_{g,t} \\in \\{0,1\\}$ and the shutdown logical indicator $z_{g,t} \\in \\{0,1\\}$ via the logical balance $u_{g,t} - u_{g,t-1} = y_{g,t} - z_{g,t}$ for all $t \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$, with the given initial condition $u_{g,0}=1$. The unit has a minimum up time $T^{\\mathrm{up}}=3$ and minimum down time $T^{\\mathrm{down}}=2$, meaning that after any start-up at time $t$ the unit must satisfy $u_{g,i}=1$ for all $i \\in \\{t,t+1,t+2\\}$ within the horizon, and after any shutdown at time $t$ the unit must satisfy $u_{g,i}=0$ for all $i \\in \\{t,t+1\\}$ within the horizon.

            "solution": "The problem requires the enumeration of all feasible commitment sequences for a single generating unit over a time horizon of $t \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$. The state of the unit in each period $t$ is given by the binary variable $u_{g,t}$, where $u_{g,t}=1$ indicates the unit is online and $u_{g,t}=0$ indicates it is offline. For notational simplicity, we will denote $u_{g,t}$ as $u_t$. The initial state at the beginning of the horizon (period $t=0$) is given as $u_0 = 1$.\n\nThe feasibility of a sequence $(u_1, u_2, u_3, u_4, u_5, u_6)$ is determined by two primary constraints: a minimum up-time of $T^{\\mathrm{up}}=3$ periods and a minimum down-time of $T^{\\mathrm{down}}=2$ periods. The initial condition at $t=0$ has no remaining minimum up-time obligation, allowing for a shutdown at $t=1$.\n\nLet us formalize the constraints based on the problem definition.\n1.  **Start-up Constraint ($T^{\\mathrm{up}}=3$):** If the unit starts up at period $t$ (i.e., $u_{t-1}=0$ and $u_t=1$), it must remain online for periods $t, t+1, t+2$. That is, if $u_{t-1}=0$ and $u_t=1$ for $t \\in \\{1,\\dots,6\\}$, then $u_i=1$ for all $i \\in \\{t, t+1, t+2\\}$ that are within the horizon $\\{1,\\dots,6\\}$.\n    - Start-up at $t=1, 2, 3, 4$: requires $u_t=u_{t+1}=u_{t+2}=1$.\n    - Start-up at $t=5$: requires $u_5=u_6=1$.\n    - Start-up at $t=6$: requires $u_6=1$.\n\n2.  **Shutdown Constraint ($T^{\\mathrm{down}}=2$):** If the unit shuts down at period $t$ (i.e., $u_{t-1}=1$ and $u_t=0$), it must remain offline for periods $t, t+1$. That is, if $u_{t-1}=1$ and $u_t=0$ for $t \\in \\{1,\\dots,6\\}$, then $u_i=0$ for all $i \\in \\{t, t+1\\}$ that are within the horizon $\\{1,\\dots,6\\}$.\n    - Shutdown at $t=1, 2, 3, 4, 5$: requires $u_t=u_{t+1}=0$.\n    - Shutdown at $t=6$: requires $u_6=0$.\n\nWe can systematically enumerate all feasible sequences by constructing a decision tree, starting from the initial state $u_0=1$.\n\n**Case 1: The unit remains online at $t=1$ ($u_1 = 1$).**\nThe sequence begins with $(1, \\dots)$. Since there was no state change, no new time constraint is triggered. We proceed by considering the first possible shutdown time.\n\n- **Always On:** The sequence $(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1)$ is valid. This is $1$ sequence.\n- **First shutdown at $t=6$:** The sequence is $(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0)$. This is a valid shutdown. This is $1$ sequence.\n- **First shutdown at $t=5$:** This implies $u_4=1, u_5=0$. The constraint $T^{\\mathrm{down}}=2$ requires $u_5=0$ and $u_6=0$. The sequence must be $(1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0)$. This is $1$ sequence.\n- **First shutdown at $t=4$:** This implies $u_3=1, u_4=0$. The constraint $T^{\\mathrm{down}}=2$ requires $u_4=0$ and $u_5=0$. The sequence starts with $(1, 1, 1, 0, 0, \\dots)$. At $t=6$, the unit has been down for $2$ periods ($t=4, 5$), so it can either stay down ($u_6=0$) or start up ($u_6=1$). A start-up at $t=6$ requires $u_6=1$, which is met.\n    - $(1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0)$ is valid.\n    - $(1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1)$ is valid.\n    This gives $2$ sequences.\n- **First shutdown at $t=3$:** This implies $u_2=1, u_3=0$, requiring $u_3=0$ and $u_4=0$. The sequence starts with $(1, 1, 0, 0, \\dots)$. At $t=5$, the unit has been down for $2$ periods ($t=3, 4$), so it can change state.\n    - Path 1: Stay down at $t=5$ ($u_5=0$). Sequence is $(1, 1, 0, 0, 0, \\dots)$. At $t=6$, it can stay down ($u_6=0$) or start up ($u_6=1$). This yields two sequences: $(1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0)$ and $(1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1)$.\n    - Path 2: Start up at $t=5$ ($u_5=1$). The constraint $T^{\\mathrm{up}}=3$ requires $u_5=1$ and $u_6=1$. This yields one sequence: $(1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1)$.\n    This gives $2+1 = 3$ sequences.\n- **First shutdown at $t=2$:** This implies $u_1=1, u_2=0$, requiring $u_2=0$ and $u_3=0$.

This reduces to the previous case structure, but shifted in time. We found $3$ valid completions from $(1,1,0,0,...)$. For $(1,0,0,0,...)$, we look at completions for $(u_5, u_6)$ starting from $u_4=0$. This gives $(0,0), (0,1), (1,1)$, for $3$ sequences: $(1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)$, $(1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1)$, $(1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1)$.\n    - Path 2: Start up at $t=4$ ($u_4=1$). The constraint $T^{\\mathrm{up}}=3$ requires $u_4=1, u_5=1, u_6=1$. This yields one sequence: $(1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1)$.\n    This gives $3+1 = 4$ sequences.\n\nTotal for Case 1: $1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 12$ distinct feasible sequences.\n\n**Case 2: The unit shuts down at $t=1$ ($u_1 = 0$).**\nThis implies $u_0=1, u_1=0$. The constraint $T^{\\mathrm{down}}=2$ requires $u_1=0$ and $u_2=0$. Thus, any sequence in this case must begin with $(0, 0, \\dots)$. At $t=3$, the unit has been down for $2$ periods, so it can start up.\n\n- **First start-up at $t=3$:** This implies $u_2=0, u_3=1$. The constraint $T^{\\mathrm{up}}=3$ requires $u_3=1, u_4=1, u_5=1$. The sequence starts with $(0, 0, 1, 1, 1, \\dots)$. At $t=6$, the unit has been up for $3$ periods, so it can either stay up ($u_6=1$) or shut down ($u_6=0$).\n    - $(0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1)$ is valid.\n    - $(0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0)$ is valid.\n    This gives $2$ sequences.\n- **Unit remains down at $t=3$ ($u_3=0$):** Sequence starts $(0, 0, 0, \\dots)$. We consider the first possible start-up time.\n    - **First start-up at $t=4$:** Sequence $(0, 0, 0, 1, \\dots)$. Requires $u_4=1, u_5=1, u_6=1$.

The givens are sufficient to find a unique, meaningful solution.\n4.  **Feasibility of Given Schedule**: The provided initial dispatch schedule is checked against all constraints (generation limits, demand balance, reserve requirements) and is found to be feasible, confirming the self-consistency of the data. For example, at $t=1$, demand $D_1=280$ MW is met by $p_{1,1}+p_{2,1}=150+130=280$ MW. The reserve is $(P^{\\max}_1-p_{1,1}) + (P^{\\max}_2-p_{2,1}) = (200-150)+(150-130)=70$ MW, which is greater than the required $R_1=50$ MW. All periods are similarly feasible.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. A solution will be computed.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe objective is to compute the minimum total operating cost for the given commitment schedule over four hours. The total cost, $C_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of costs from each hour $t$:\n$$C_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{t=1}^{4} \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{3} (F_{i} u_{i,t} + S_{i} v_{i,t}) + \\sum_{i=1}^{3} c_{i} p_{i,t} \\right)$$\nSince the commitment schedule ($u_{i,t}$) and startup decisions ($v_{i,t}$) are given, the no-load ($F_i$) and startup ($S_i$) costs are fixed. To minimize $C_{\\text{total}}$, we must minimize the variable energy cost component, $\\sum_{t=1}^4 \\sum_{i=1}^3 c_i p_{i,t}$. As there are no inter-temporal dispatch constraints (like ramping), we can minimize the energy cost for each hour independently. This is a classic Economic Dispatch Problem (EDP) for each hour.\n\nFor each hour $t$, we solve:\n$$ \\min_{p_{i,t}} \\sum_{i=1}^{3} c_i p_{i,t} $$\nSubject to:\n1.

Spinning Reserve: $\\sum_{i=1}^{3} (u_{i,t} P^{\\max}_i - p_{i,t}) \\ge R_t$\n\nThe spinning reserve constraint can be rewritten using the energy balance constraint: $\\sum_{i=1}^{3} u_{i,t} P^{\\max}_i - D_t \\ge R_t$. This is a check on the total committed capacity, which must be performed before dispatch.\n\nThe marginal costs are $c_{1} = 15$, $c_{2} = 20$, and $c_{3} = 40$.

            "problem": "Consider a direct-current (DC) approximation of a three-bus transmission network used in Security-Constrained Unit Commitment (SCUC) and Security-Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED). Buses are labeled $1$, $2$, and $3$, with bus $1$ designated as the slack (reference) bus, i.e., its phase angle is fixed at $0$. The network topology is radial: bus $1$ is connected to bus $2$, and bus $2$ is connected to bus $3$. The series reactances are identical and positive, and the DC model assumes linearized power flows, small angle differences, and lossless lines.\n\nThere is one monitored transmission constraint: the real-power flow on line $(2 \\rightarrow 3)$ must satisfy $F_{23} \\leq F_{23}^{\\max}$ in the positive direction from bus $2$ to bus $3$. The limit is $F_{23}^{\\max} = 60$ MW. The line $(1 \\rightarrow 2)$ has no binding constraint in this scenario.\n\nAt each bus $i \\in \\{1,2,3\\}$ there is a conventional generator with linear marginal cost $c_i$ and ample capacity (no generation limit binds). The marginal costs are ordered $c_1 < c_2 < c_3$ and given numerically by $c_1 = 10 \\text{ \\$/MWh}$, $c_2 = 20 \\text{ \\$/MWh}$, and $c_3 = 40 \\text{ \\$/MWh}$. There is a single-period demand: $d_1 = 0$ MW, $d_2 = 0$ MW, and $d_3 = 100$ MW. Ramping and unit commitment binaries are not binding in this single-period case.\n\nUse the DC power flow fundamentals and the definition of the Power Transfer Distribution Factor (PTDF), defined for line $(2 \\rightarrow 3)$ as the sensitivity of $F_{23}$ to an incremental injection at bus $i$ balanced by an equal withdrawal at the slack bus $1$, to derive the Locational Marginal Price (LMP) at each bus. Let $\\mu_{23} \\geq 0$ denote the Lagrange multiplier (dual variable) associated with the upper bound $F_{23} \\leq F_{23}^{\\max}$. Assume the lower bound on $F_{23}$ is not binding.\n\nStarting from first principles, formulate the SCED problem under the DC model, derive the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions, identify the binding constraints, and use the PTDF and the line-constraint dual to compute the nodal LMPs $\\text{LMP}_1$, $\\text{LMP}_2$, and $\\text{LMP}_3$. Then interpret the nodal price differences as congestion-induced price separation and compute the total congestion rent collected on line $(2 \\rightarrow 3)$.\n\nRound each LMP to four significant figures and express them in $\\text{\\$/MWh}$. Round the congestion rent to four significant figures and express it in $\\text{\\$/h}$. Report your final numeric results in the order $\\left(\\text{LMP}_1, \\text{LMP}_2, \\text{LMP}_3, R\\right)$, where $R$ is the congestion rent on line $(2 \\rightarrow 3)$.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the Locational Marginal Prices (LMPs) at three buses and the congestion rent on a transmission line in a Security-Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED) framework. The analysis will proceed by first formulating the optimization problem, then deriving the power flow constraints using the provided DC approximation, solving the problem using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, and finally computing the LMPs and congestion rent from the solution.\n\nFirst, we validate the problem statement.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **Network**: Three-bus DC network with buses labeled $1$, $2$, $3$.\n- **Slack Bus**: Bus $1$ is the reference bus with phase angle $\\theta_1 = 0$.\n- **Topology**: Radial connection: line $(1,2)$ and line $(2,3)$.\n- **Line Parameters**: Series reactances are identical and positive, let's denote the reactance by $x > 0$. The susceptance is $b = 1/x$.\n- **Constraint**: Power flow on line $(2 \\rightarrow 3)$ is limited by $F_{23} \\leq F_{23}^{\\max}$.\n- **Flow Limit**: $F_{23}^{\\max} = 60$ MW.\n- **Generator Costs**: Marginal costs are $c_1 = 10 \\text{ \\$/MWh}$, $c_2 = 20 \\text{ \\$/MWh}$, $c_3 = 40 \\text{ \\$/MWh}$.\n- **Demands**: Single-period demands are $d_1 = 0$ MW, $d_2 = 0$ MW, $d_3 = 100$ MW.\n- **Dual Variable**: $\\mu_{23} \\geq 0$ is the Lagrange multiplier for the line constraint.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is a classic and well-defined SCED problem.\n- **Scientifically Grounded**: The problem uses the DC power flow model, a standard and fundamental tool in power system analysis for operational planning. The concepts of LMPs, PTDFs, and KKT conditions are central to electricity market theory and practice.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is a linear program with a convex objective function and linear constraints. All necessary data are provided, and the setup ensures that a unique and meaningful solution exists. The assumption of identical reactances simplifies the calculation, but the exact value is not needed as it will cancel out in the PTDF calculation for this particular topology.\n- **Objective**: The language is precise and uses standard industry terminology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. The solution process will now commence.\n\nThe SCED problem is to minimize the total cost of generation subject to system-wide power balance and network security constraints.\nThe objective function is the total generation cost:\n$$\n\\min_{p_1, p_2, p_3} C = c_1 p_1 + c_2 p_2 + c_3 p_3 = 10 p_1 + 20 p_2 + 40 p_3\n$$\nThe generation variables $p_i$ for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ are assumed to be non-negative, $p_i \\geq 0$.\n\nThe constraints are:\n1.  **Power Balance**: The total generation must equal the total demand.\n    $$\n    \\sum_{i=1}^{3} p_i = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} d_i \\implies p_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 0 + 0 + 100 = 100\n    $$\n2.  **Transmission Security**: The flow on line $(2,3)$ must not exceed its limit.\n    $$\n    F_{23} \\leq F_{23}^{\\max} = 60\n    $$\n\nTo express $F_{23}$ in terms of the generation variables, we use the DC power flow model. The flow on a line $(i,j)$ is $F_{ij} = \\frac{1}{x_{ij}}(\\theta_i - \\theta_j) = b_{ij}(\\theta_i - \\theta_j)$. In a radial network, the flow on the terminal line segment $(2,3)$ is determined solely by the net power injection at the terminal bus $3$. The power flowing from bus $2$ to bus $3$ must equal the demand at bus $3$ minus the generation at bus $3$.\n$$\nF_{23} = d_3 - p_3 = 100 - p_3\n$$\nThis can be formally derived using Power Transfer Distribution Factors (PTDFs). The PTDF, $\\text{PTDF}_{l,k}$, gives the change in flow on line $l$ for a $1$ MW injection at bus $k$ withdrawn at the slack bus. For a radial line $(2,3)$ with slack at bus $1$, the PTDFs for line $(2,3)$ are:\n- $\\text{PTDF}_{23,2} = 0$: An injection at bus $2$ balanced at bus $1$ flows only on line $(1,2)$ and does not affect line $(2,3)$.\n- $\\text{PTDF}_{23,3} = -1$: An injection at bus $3$ balanced at bus $1$ must be sourced from bus $1$. This power flows from $1 \\to 2 \\to 3$. To inject $1$ MW at bus $3$, one must \"push back\" on the flow coming from bus $2$, thus reducing the flow $F_{23}$ by $1$ MW.\nThe flow on line $(2,3)$ is given by:\n$$\nF_{23} = \\sum_{k \\neq \\text{slack}} \\text{PTDF}_{23,k} (p_k - d_k) = \\text{PTDF}_{23,2}(p_2 - d_2) + \\text{PTDF}_{23,3}(p_3 - d_3)\n$$\nSubstituting the known values:\n$$\nF_{23} = (0)(p_2 - 0) + (-1)(p_3 - 100) = 100 - p_3\n$$\nSo the line constraint becomes $100 - p_3 \\leq 60$, which simplifies to $p_3 \\geq 40$.\n\nFirst, let us examine the unconstrained economic dispatch. To minimize cost, we would use the cheapest generator, $G_1$, to meet the entire $100$ MW load. The dispatch would be $p_1 = 100$ MW, $p_2 = 0$ MW, $p_3 = 0$ MW. In this case, the flow on line $(2,3)$ would be $F_{23} = 100 - p_3 = 100 - 0 = 100$ MW. Since $100 \\text{ MW} > 60 \\text{ MW}$, this dispatch violates the transmission constraint. The system is congested.\n\nWe must solve the full SCED problem. The optimization problem is:\n$$\n\\min_{p_1, p_2, p_3} (10 p_1 + 20 p_2 + 40 p_3)\n$$\nsubject to:\n$$\np_1 + p_2 + p_3 = 100 \\quad (\\text{dual variable } \\lambda)\n$$\n$$\n40 - p_3 \\leq 0 \\quad (\\text{dual variable } \\mu_{23})\n$$\n$$\np_1 \\geq 0, \\quad p_2 \\geq 0, \\quad p_3 \\geq 0\n$$\nSince the unconstrained solution is infeasible, the line constraint must be binding at the optimum, i.e., $40 - p_3 = 0 \\implies p_3 = 40$ MW.\nThe system needs a total of $100$ MW. With $p_3 = 40$ MW, the remaining $100 - 40 = 60$ MW must be supplied by generators $G_1$ and $G_2$. Since $c_1 < c_2$, the remaining demand should be met entirely by the cheaper generator, $G_1$.\nThus, the optimal dispatch is:\n$$\np_1 = 60 \\text{ MW}, \\quad p_2 = 0 \\text{ MW}, \\quad p_3 = 40 \\text{ MW}\n$$\nThis solution satisfies all constraints: $p_i \\ge 0$, total generation is $60+0+40=100$ MW, and the line flow is $F_{23} = 100 - p_3 = 100 - 40 = 60$ MW, which is at the limit.\n\nNow we find the Lagrange multipliers by forming the Lagrangian and using the KKT conditions.\nThe Lagrangian is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(p_1, p_2, p_3, \\lambda, \\mu_{23}) = (10 p_1 + 20 p_2 + 40 p_3) - \\lambda(p_1 + p_2 + p_3 - 100) - \\mu_{23}(- (40 - p_3))\n$$\n$$\n\\mathcal{L} = (10 p_1 + 20 p_2 + 40 p_3) - \\lambda(p_1 + p_2 + p_3 - 100) + \\mu_{23}(p_3 - 40)\n$$\nWe have used the standard formulation where the multiplier for a constraint $g(x) \\le 0$ would have the form $-\\mu g(x)$, requiring $\\mu \\ge 0$. Here, $g(p_3) = 40 - p_3$. And we write the constraint as $p_3 \\ge 40$, so $40-p_3 \\le 0$. The KKT optimality conditions are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial p_1} = 10 - \\lambda \\geq 0 \\quad (\\text{equality if } p_1 > 0)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial p_2} = 20 - \\lambda \\geq 0 \\quad (\\text{equality if } p_2 > 0)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial p_3} = 40 - \\lambda + \\mu_{23} \\geq 0 \\quad (\\text{equality if } p_3 > 0)\n$$\nSince $p_1 = 60 > 0$:\n$$\n10 - \\lambda = 0 \\implies \\lambda = 10\n$$\nSince $p_2 = 0$, we check the inequality:\n$$\n20 - \\lambda = 20 - 10 = 10 \\geq 0 \\quad (\\text{satisfied})\n$$\nSince $p_3 = 40 > 0$:\n$$\n40 - \\lambda + \\mu_{23} = 0 \\implies 40 - 10 + \\mu_{23} = 0 \\implies \\mu_{23} = -30\n$$\nThere is a sign convention issue in my Lagrangian setup. Let's use the standard form $\\mathcal{L} = f(x) + \\lambda h(x) + \\mu g(x)$ where constraints are $h(x)=0, g(x) \\le 0$ and $\\mu \\ge 0$.\nThe Lagrangian is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L} = (10 p_1 + 20 p_2 + 40 p_3) + \\lambda(100 - p_1 - p_2 - p_3) + \\mu_{23}(40 - p_3)\n$$\nThe KKT conditions become:\n$\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial p_1} = 10 - \\lambda = 0 \\implies \\lambda = 10$ (since $p_1=60>0$)\n$\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial p_2} = 20 - \\lambda \\ge 0 \\implies 20-10=10 \\ge 0$ (since $p_2=0$)\n$\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial p_3} = 40 - \\lambda - \\mu_{23} = 0 \\implies 40 - 10 - \\mu_{23} = 0 \\implies \\mu_{23} = 30$ (since $p_3=40>0$)\nWe must have $\\mu_{23} \\ge 0$, which is satisfied. This formulation is consistent. $\\lambda$ is the system marginal energy price, and $\\mu_{23}$ is the congestion price.\n\nThe Locational Marginal Price (LMP) at the reference bus (bus 1) is simply $\\lambda$.\n$$\n\\text{LMP}_1 = \\lambda = 10 \\text{ \\$/MWh}\n$$\nThe LMPs at other buses are computed by adjusting the reference bus LMP by the marginal cost of congestion caused by an injection at that bus. The formula is:\n$$\n\\text{LMP}_k = \\lambda - \\sum_{l} \\mu_l \\text{PTDF}_{l,k}\n$$\nIn our case, there is only one congested line, $(2,3)$. So for bus $k$:\n$$\n\\text{LMP}_k = \\lambda - \\mu_{23} \\text{PTDF}_{23,k}\n$$\nUsing $\\lambda=10$, $\\mu_{23}=30$, and the previously determined PTDFs:\n$$\n\\text{LMP}_1 = \\lambda - \\mu_{23} \\text{PTDF}_{23,1} = 10 - (30)(0) = 10\n$$\n$$\n\\text{LMP}_2 = \\lambda - \\mu_{23} \\text{PTDF}_{23,2} = 10 - (30)(0) = 10\n$$\n$$\n\\text{LMP}_3 = \\lambda - \\mu_{23} \\text{PTDF}_{23,3} = 10 - (30)(-1) = 10 + 30 = 40\n$$\nSo the LMPs are $\\text{LMP}_1 = 10.00 \\text{ \\$/MWh}$, $\\text{LMP}_2 = 10.00 \\text{ \\$/MWh}$, and $\\text{LMP}_3 = 40.00 \\text{ \\$/MWh}$.\nThe price at bus $3$ is set by the local expensive generator $G_3$ because importing cheaper power is limited by congestion. The prices at buses $1$ and $2$ are set by the cheap generator $G_1$ as there is no congestion between them.\n\nThe congestion rent, $R$, collected on line $(2,3)$ is the product of the power flow and the LMP difference across the line.\n$$\nR_{23} = F_{23} \\times (\\text{LMP}_3 - \\text{LMP}_2)\n$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\nR_{23} = 60 \\text{ MW} \\times (40 \\text{ \\$/MWh} - 10 \\text{ \\$/MWh}) = 60 \\times 30 \\text{ \\$/h} = 1800 \\text{ \\$/h}\n$$\nThis can be verified by calculating the difference between total payments by loads and total payments to generators.\nTotal load payment = $\\sum_k \\text{LMP}_k d_k = \\text{LMP}_3 \\times d_3 = 40 \\times 100 = 4000 \\text{ \\$/h}$.\nTotal generation cost = $\\sum_i c_i p_i = (10)(60) + (20)(0) + (40)(40) = 600 + 1600 = 2200 \\text{ \\$/h}$.\nCongestion Rent = Load Payment - Generation Cost = $4000 - 2200 = 1800 \\text{ \\$/h}$, which matches.\n\nThe final numeric results rounded to four significant figures are:\n- $\\text{LMP}_1 = 10.00$ $\\text{\\$/MWh}$\n- $\\text{LMP}_2 = 10.00$ $\\text{\\$/MWh}$\n- $\\text{LMP}_3 = 40.00$ $\\text{\\$/MWh}$\n- $R = 1800$ $\\text{\\$/h}$. Can be written as $1.800 \\times 10^3$.\n\nThe final answer is presented in the required matrix format.",
