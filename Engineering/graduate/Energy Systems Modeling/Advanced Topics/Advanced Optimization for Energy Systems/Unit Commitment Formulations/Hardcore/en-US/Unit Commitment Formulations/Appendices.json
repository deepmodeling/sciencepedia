The generation time series is discretized with a uniform time step of $\\Delta t = 1$ hour, and the unit is committed for the entire horizon. Denote the load at hour $t$ by $L_t$ and the unit’s dispatch by $P_t$. The unit must satisfy power balance $P_t = L_t$ at all times, a minimum stable generation constraint $P_t \\geq P^{\\min}$ when committed, and symmetric ramping constraints defined per hour: ramp-up $R^{\\uparrow}$ and ramp-down $R^{\\downarrow}$. The initial dispatch at time $t=0$ is $P_0$.

The final answer must be a single real number without units. No rounding is required.",
            "solution": "The problem asks whether the unit can track the given load exactly subject to minimum generation and ramping limits. The foundational principles are the equality of dispatch and load at each time, $P_t = L_t$, when the unit is committed, and the intra-temporal constraints on changes in dispatch, known as ramping constraints. These are standard operational constraints in Unit Commitment (UC) formulations within energy systems modeling.\n\nWe proceed by checking the constraints systematically.\n\nFirst, the minimum generation constraint requires $P_t \\geq P^{\\min}$ for all $t$. Since $P_t = L_t$, we must have $L_t \\geq P^{\\min}$ for all $t$. The given values are\n$$\nL_1 = 260, \\quad L_2 = 340, \\quad L_3 = 280, \\quad L_4 = 170, \\quad L_5 = 150, \\quad L_6 = 220, \\quad L_7 = 310, \\quad L_8 = 180.\n$$\nWith $P^{\\min} = 150$, we check each:\n- $L_1 = 260 \\geq 150$ holds.\n- $L_2 = 340 \\geq 150$ holds.\n- $L_3 = 280 \\geq 150$ holds.\n- $L_4 = 170 \\geq 150$ holds.\n- $L_5 = 150 \\geq 150$ holds (binding but feasible).\n- $L_6 = 220 \\geq 150$ holds.\n- $L_7 = 310 \\geq 150$ holds.\n- $L_8 = 180 \\geq 150$ holds.\n\nThus, the minimum generation constraint is satisfied at all hours if the unit tracks load exactly.\n\nSecond, consider ramping constraints. With time discretization $\\Delta t = 1$ hour, the maximum allowed increase in dispatch between consecutive hours is $R^{\\uparrow} \\Delta t = 90 \\times 1 = 90$ megawatts, and the maximum allowed decrease is $R^{\\downarrow} \\Delta t = 110 \\times 1 = 110$ megawatts. Since $P_t = L_t$, we can check the ramping constraints by examining the differences $L_t - L_{t-1}$, starting from the initial dispatch $P_0 = 200$ which must transition to $L_1$.\n\nCompute the sequential differences and compare to ramp limits:\n- From $t=0$ to $t=1$: $L_1 - P_0 = 260 - 200 = 60$. Ramp-up check: $60 \\leq 90$ holds.\n- From $t=1$ to $t=2$: $L_2 - L_1 = 340 - 260 = 80$. Ramp-up check: $80 \\leq 90$ holds.\n- From $t=2$ to $t=3$: $L_3 - L_2 = 280 - 340 = -60$. Ramp-down magnitude: $|{-60}| = 60 \\leq 110$ holds.\n- From $t=3$ to $t=4$: $L_4 - L_3 = 170 - 280 = -110$. Ramp-down magnitude: $|{-110}| = 110 \\leq 110$ holds (exactly at the limit, which is permitted because the inequality is non-strict).\n- From $t=4$ to $t=5$: $L_5 - L_4 = 150 - 170 = -20$. Ramp-down magnitude: $|{-20}| = 20 \\leq 110$ holds.\n- From $t=5$ to $t=6$: $L_6 - L_5 = 220 - 150 = 70$. Ramp-up check: $70 \\leq 90$ holds.\n- From $t=6$ to $t=7$: $L_7 - L_6 = 310 - 220 = 90$. Ramp-up check: $90 \\leq 90$ holds (at the limit).\n- From $t=7$ to $t=8$: $L_8 - L_7 = 180 - 310 = -130$. Ramp-down magnitude: $|{-130}| = 130$. Compare to the ramp-down limit $110$: $130 > 110$ does not hold.\n\nTherefore, there is a ramp-down violation between $t=7$ and $t=8$. Since the unit must track load exactly and the change required exceeds the ramp-down capability, there is no feasible dispatch that satisfies all constraints. The feasibility indicator is thus $I = 0$.\n\nNo other constraints are binding or violated, and the minimum generation constraints are satisfied, but the single ramp-down violation suffices to establish infeasibility.\n\nHence, the computed feasibility indicator is $I = 0$.",

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of energy systems modeling, specifically unit commitment, and is well-posed, objective, and complete. All necessary data and definitions for a unique solution are provided.\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine the sequence of startup and shutdown events from a given on/off schedule for a thermal generating unit, and then to calculate the total associated costs.\n\nFirst, we establish the definitions for the startup and shutdown indicators, $y_t$ and $z_t$, in terms of the binary commitment status $u_t$. A startup occurs at time $t$ if the unit transitions from off ($u_{t-1}=0$) to on ($u_t=1$). A shutdown occurs if the unit transitions from on ($u_{t-1}=1$) to off ($u_t=0$).

The total number of startups is $\\sum_{t=1}^{16} y_t = 4$. The total number of shutdowns is $\\sum_{t=1}^{16} z_t = 4$. The net number of transitions is $\\sum y_t - \\sum z_t = 4 - 4 = 0$. The change in status between $t=0$ and $t=T=16$ is $u_{16} - u_0 = 1 - 1 = 0$. The property is verified as $0=0$. This is expected, as $\\sum_{t=1}^{T} (y_t - z_t) = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} (u_t - u_{t-1}) = u_T - u_0$ is a telescoping sum.\n2. The definitions $y_t = \\max(0, u_t-u_{t-1})$ and $z_t=\\max(0, u_{t-1}-u_t)$ ensure that for any given transition, only one of them can be non-zero. If $u_t=u_{t-1}$, both are $0$. If $u_t \\ne u_{t-1}$, one is $1$ and the other is $0$. Thus, $y_t + z_t \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ for all $t$, which satisfies $y_t+z_t \\le 1$. No simultaneous startup and shutdown occurs.\n\nNow, we categorize each startup by calculating the preceding downtime length, $\\ell_t$.\n- For the startup at $t=5$: We inspect the statuses $u_4, u_3, \\dots$. We have $u_4=0$ and $u_3=0$, but $u_2=1$. The length of consecutive off-states is $2$. Thus, $\\ell_5=2$. This is a Warm start.\n- For the startup at $t=10$: We inspect $u_9, u_8, \\dots$. We have $u_9=0$ and $u_8=0$, but $u_7=1$. The length of consecutive off-states is $2$. Thus, $\\ell_{10}=2$. This is a Warm start.\n- For the startup at $t=12$: We inspect $u_{11}, u_{10}, \\dots$.

We have $u_{15}=0$ and $u_{14}=0$, but $u_{13}=1$. The length of consecutive off-states is $2$. Thus, $\\ell_{16}=2$. This is a Warm start.\n\nThere are no cold starts ($\\ell_t \\ge 3$) in this schedule.\nThe total startup cost is the sum of costs for each startup event:\n- $t=5$: Warm start, cost is $C_{\\text{warm}} = 5 \\text{ k\\$}$.\n- $t=10$: Warm start, cost is $C_{\\text{warm}} = 5 \\text{ k\\$}$.\n- $t=12$: Hot start, cost is $C_{\\text{hot}} = 3 \\text{ k\\$}$.\n- $t=16$: Warm start, cost is $C_{\\text{warm}} = 5 \\text{ k\\$}$.\n$$\n\\text{Total Startup Cost} = C_{\\text{warm}} + C_{\\text{warm}} + C_{\\text{hot}} + C_{\\text{warm}} = 5 + 5 + 3 + 5 = 18 \\text{ k\\$}\n$$\nThe total shutdown cost is the number of shutdowns multiplied by the cost per shutdown, $C_{\\downarrow}=0.8 \\text{ k\\$}$.

Thus, the unit is free to either stay on or shut down. $u_3$ is a decision variable.\n    The state transition is $u_3 - u_2 = y_3 - z_3 \\implies u_3 - 1 = y_3 - z_3$.\n    - If $u_3=1$, then $y_3=0, z_3=0$.\n    - If $u_3=0$, then $y_3=0, z_3=1$.\n\n2.  **Generation and Ramping Limits ($g_3$):** These depend on the choice of $u_3$.\n    - **Case A: Unit stays on ($u_3=1, y_3=0, z_3=0$).**\n      - Generation limits: $50 \\le g_3 \\le 200$.\n      - Ramping: $\\max(50, g_2 - 60) \\le g_3 \\le \\min(200, g_2 + 40)$.\n    - **Case B: Unit shuts down ($u_3=0, y_3=0, z_3=1$).**\n      - Generation: $g_3 = 0$.\n      - Ramping: The ramp-down constraint on the previous period's generation $g_2$ becomes binding.\n        $g_2 - g_3 \\le R^{\\downarrow} u_3 + S^{\\downarrow} z_3 \\implies g_2 - 0 \\le (60)(0) + (120)(1) \\implies g_2 \\le 120$.\n        This means shutting down at $t=3$ is only possible if $g_2 \\le 120$ MW.\n\n### Task 2: Determination of Maximum Feasible $g_1$\n\nThe maximum feasible value of $g_1$ is the highest value that satisfies the constraints for $t=1$ and allows for a valid sequence of states and generation levels for $t=2$ and $t=3$.\n\nFrom Task 1, the constraints applicable to $t=1$ restrict $g_1$ to the interval $[50, 130]$. The maximum value from this interval is $g_1 = 130$ MW. We must verify if setting $g_1=130$ allows for a feasible trajectory for $t=2$ and $t=3$.\n\nLet's assume $g_1 = 130$.\n\n**Feasibility Check for $t=2$:**\nThe constraints on $g_2$ are:\n$$\\max(50, g_1 - 60) \\le g_2 \\le \\min(200, g_1 + 40)$$\nSubstituting $g_1=130$:\n$$\\max(50, 130 - 60) \\le g_2 \\le \\min(200, 130 + 40)$$\n$$\\max(50, 70) \\le g_2 \\le \\min(200, 170)$$\n$$70 \\le g_2 \\le 170$$\nSince this interval is non-empty (e.g., we can choose $g_2=100$), a feasible generation level for $t=2$ exists.\n\n**Feasibility Check for $t=3$:**\nFor a schedule to be feasible, there must be at least one valid option for $t=3$. We need to check if, for any valid $g_2$ (where $70 \\le g_2 \\le 170$), there exists a valid state for $t=3$.\nLet's analyze the two possible actions at $t=3$:\n\n- **Option A (Stay on, $u_3=1$):**\n  We need to find if a feasible $g_3$ exists. The interval for $g_3$ is $[\\max(50, g_2 - 60), \\min(200, g_2 + 40)]$. This interval is non-empty if the lower bound is less than or equal to the upper bound. For any $g_2$ in its valid range $[70, 170]$:\n  - $g_2 - 60 \\le g_2 + 40$ (always true).\n  - $50 \\le g_2 + 40 \\implies g_2 \\ge 10$ (true since $g_2 \\ge 70$).\n  - $g_2 - 60 \\le 200 \\implies g_2 \\le 260$ (true since $g_2 \\le 170$).\n  Therefore, for any valid choice of $g_2$, a feasible $g_3$ can always be found if the unit stays on. A feasible path exists.\n\n- **Option B (Shut down, $u_3=0$):**\n  This option is only available if $g_2 \\le S^{\\downarrow} = 120$. Since the feasible range for $g_2$ is $[70, 170]$, we could choose a $g_2$ (e.g., $g_2 = 100$) that allows for shutdown, or we could choose a $g_2$ (e.g., $g_2=150$) that does not.\n\nThe crucial point is that a schedule is feasible as long as *at least one* path forward exists. Since Option A (staying on) is always available for any feasible $g_2$, a feasible path for $t=3$ is always guaranteed regardless of the choice of $g_2$ (within its allowed range).\n\nThis confirms that the constraints from future periods ($t=2, 3$) do not impose any further restrictions on the range of $g_1$. The feasible range for $g_1$ is simply the one derived from the $t=1$ constraints alone, which is $50 \\le g_1 \\le 130$.\n\nThe maximum value in this range is $130$. Any value $g_1 > 130$ would violate the ramp-up constraint for $t=1$. Therefore, the maximum feasible generation in period $t=1$ is $130$ MW.",
