            "problem": "In an Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) energy-control module modeled by a Mamdani fuzzy inference system (FIS), the target is to compute a crisp fan-speed command based on two input linguistic assessments: “temperature is high” with degree $0.6$ and “humidity is medium” with degree $0.4$. Assume the following:\n\n- Rule base (three rules):\n  1. If temperature is high, then fan speed is high.\n  2. If humidity is medium, then fan speed is medium.\n  3. If temperature is high and humidity is medium, then fan speed is high.\n\n- Inference and aggregation conventions:\n  - Logical AND is modeled by the minimum operator.\n  - Implication is modeled by truncation via the minimum operator.\n  - Aggregation over consequents is modeled by the maximum operator.\n\n- Output universe of discourse for the fan speed $s$ is the closed interval $[0,100]$ (interpreted as a $0$ to $100$ scale of command). The output membership functions are defined as:\n  - Medium (triangular):\n    $$\\mu_{\\text{med}}(s) = \\begin{cases}\n    \\dfrac{s-30}{20}, & 30 \\le s \\le 50 \\\\[6pt]\n    \\dfrac{70 - s}{20}, & 50 < s \\le 70 \\\\[6pt]\n    0, & \\text{otherwise}\n    \\end{cases}$$\n  - High (triangular):\n    $$\\mu_{\\text{high}}(s) = \\begin{cases}\n    \\dfrac{s - 60}{20}, & 60 \\le s \\le 80 \\\\[6pt]\n    \\dfrac{100 - s}{20}, & 80 < s \\le 100 \\\\[6pt]\n    0, & \\text{otherwise}\n    \\end{cases}$$\n\n- Defuzzification is by the centroid (center of area):\n  $$s^{\\ast} \\;=\\; \\dfrac{\\displaystyle \\int_{0}^{100} s\\, \\mu_{\\text{agg}}(s)\\, ds}{\\displaystyle \\int_{0}^{100} \\mu_{\\text{agg}}(s)\\, ds},$$\n  where $\\mu_{\\text{agg}}(s)$ is the aggregated output membership after rule evaluation, implication, and aggregation.\n\nUse the given input degrees $0.6$ (for “temperature is high”) and $0.4$ (for “humidity is medium”), apply Mamdani inference with min–max aggregation, and compute the centroid $s^{\\ast}$.

            "solution": "The problem is a well-posed application of Mamdani fuzzy inference. It is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and has a unique solution. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe process involves five steps:\n1.  Evaluation of rule antecedents (firing strengths).\n2.  Application of implication to the consequents.\n3.  Aggregation of the rule outputs.\n4.  Defuzzification using the centroid method.\n\nThe given inputs are the degrees of membership for the linguistic variables:\n-   Degree of “temperature is high” is $d_T = 0.6$.\n-   Degree of “humidity is medium” is $d_H = 0.4$.\n\nThe output membership functions for fan speed $s \\in [0, 100]$ are:\n-   Medium: $\\mu_{\\text{med}}(s)$\n-   High: $\\mu_{\\text{high}}(s)$\n\nThe operators are:\n-   AND: minimum, $\\min(a,b)$.\n-   Implication (truncation): minimum, $\\min(a,b)$.\n-   Aggregation: maximum, $\\max(a,b)$.\n\n**Step 1: Rule Firing Strengths**\n\nWe calculate the firing strength, $w_i$, for each of the three rules.\n-   **Rule 1:** \"If temperature is high, then fan speed is high.\"\n    The firing strength is the degree to which the antecedent (\"temperature is high\") is true.\n    $$w_1 = d_T = 0.6$$\n-   **Rule 2:** \"If humidity is medium, then fan speed is medium.\"\n    The firing strength is the degree to which the antecedent (\"humidity is medium\") is true.\n    $$w_2 = d_H = 0.4$$\n-   **Rule 3:** \"If temperature is high and humidity is medium, then fan speed is high.\"\n    The antecedent combines two propositions with a logical AND, which is modeled by the minimum operator.\n    $$w_3 = \\min(d_T, d_H) = \\min(0.6, 0.4) = 0.4$$\n\n**Step 2: Implication**\n\nThe implication method is truncation using the minimum operator. The output of each rule is a fuzzy set obtained by clipping the consequent's membership function at the level of the rule's firing strength.\n-   **Rule 1 Output:** $\\mu_1(s) = \\min(w_1, \\mu_{\\text{high}}(s)) = \\min(0.6, \\mu_{\\text{high}}(s))$.\n-   **Rule 2 Output:** $\\mu_2(s) = \\min(w_2, \\mu_{\\text{med}}(s)) = \\min(0.4, \\mu_{\\text{med}}(s))$.\n-   **Rule 3 Output:** $\\mu_3(s) = \\min(w_3, \\mu_{\\text{high}}(s)) = \\min(0.4, \\mu_{\\text{high}}(s))$.\n\n**Step 3: Aggregation**\n\nThe individual rule outputs are aggregated using the maximum operator to form a single fuzzy set for the output variable, $\\mu_{\\text{agg}}(s)$.\n$$\\mu_{\\text{agg}}(s) = \\max(\\mu_1(s), \\mu_2(s), \\mu_3(s))$$\nWe observe that for any value of $s$, $\\mu_{\\text{high}}(s) \\ge 0$. Since $0.4 < 0.6$, it follows that $\\min(0.4, \\mu_{\\text{high}}(s)) \\le \\min(0.6, \\mu_{\\text{high}}(s))$. Therefore, $\\mu_3(s) \\le \\mu_1(s)$ for all $s$. This means that Rule 3 is subsumed by Rule 1 in the max-aggregation step, so $\\max(\\mu_1(s), \\mu_3(s)) = \\mu_1(s)$. The aggregated function simplifies to:\n$$\\mu_{\\text{agg}}(s) = \\max(\\mu_1(s), \\mu_2(s)) = \\max(\\min(0.6, \\mu_{\\text{high}}(s)), \\min(0.4, \\mu_{\\text{med}}(s)))$$\nTo define this function piecewise, we first analyze the truncated components.\n-   For $\\min(0.4, \\mu_{\\text{med}}(s))$: $\\mu_{\\text{med}}(s)$ reaches a value of $0.4$ at $s=30+20(0.4)=38$ and $s=70-20(0.4)=62$.\n-   For $\\min(0.6, \\mu_{\\text{high}}(s))$: $\\mu_{\\text{high}}(s)$ reaches a value of $0.6$ at $s=60+20(0.6)=72$ and $s=100-20(0.6)=88$.\n\nThe aggregated membership function $\\mu_{\\text{agg}}(s)$ is defined piecewise by taking the pointwise maximum of the two truncated fuzzy sets:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\text{agg}}(s) = \\begin{cases}\n\\dfrac{s-30}{20}, & 30 \\le s < 38 \\\\\n0.4, & 38 \\le s < 62 \\\\\n\\dfrac{70-s}{20}, & 62 \\le s < 65 \\\\\n\\dfrac{s-60}{20}, & 65 \\le s < 72 \\\\\n0.6, & 72 \\le s < 88 \\\\\n\\dfrac{100-s}{20}, & 88 \\le s \\le 100 \\\\\n0, & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe switchover point at $s=65$ is found by equating $\\frac{70-s}{20} = \\frac{s-60}{20}$, which gives $130 = 2s$, so $s=65$.\n\n**Step 4: Defuzzification**\n\nWe use the centroid method to find the crisp output $s^*$:\n$$s^{\\ast} = \\frac{\\displaystyle \\int_{0}^{100} s\\, \\mu_{\\text{agg}}(s)\\, ds}{\\displaystyle \\int_{0}^{100} \\mu_{\\text{agg}}(s)\\, ds} = \\frac{M}{A}$$\nWe calculate the area $A$ and the first moment of area $M$ by integrating over an appropriate partition of the domain $[0, 100]$.\n\nDenominator (Area, $A$):\n$A = \\int_{30}^{38} \\frac{s-30}{20} ds + \\int_{38}^{62} 0.4 ds + \\int_{62}^{65} \\frac{70-s}{20} ds + \\int_{65}^{72} \\frac{s-60}{20} ds + \\int_{72}^{88} 0.6 ds + \\int_{88}^{100} \\frac{100-s}{20} ds$\nThese correspond to the areas of two triangles, two rectangles, and two trapezoids which we can combine.\n$A_1 = \\frac{1}{2}(38-30)(0.4) = 1.6$\n$A_2 = (62-38)(0.4) = 9.6$\n$A_3 = \\frac{1}{2}(65-62)(0.4 + 0.25) = \\frac{1}{2}(3)(0.65) = 0.975$\n$A_4 = \\frac{1}{2}(72-65)(0.25 + 0.6) = \\frac{1}{2}(7)(0.85) = 2.975$\n$A_5 = (88-72)(0.6) = 9.6$\n$A_6 = \\frac{1}{2}(100-88)(0.6) = 3.6$\nTotal Area: $A = 1.6 + 9.6 + 0.975 + 2.975 + 9.6 + 3.6 = 28.35$\n\nNumerator (First Moment of Area, $M$):\n$M = \\int_{30}^{100} s \\mu_{\\text{agg}}(s) ds$.

The limits change from $[0.6, 1.0]$ to $[0.4, 0]$.\n$$\n\\int_{0.4}^{0} (1-v)v^3 (-dv) = \\int_{0}^{0.4} (v^3-v^4) dv = \\left[ \\frac{v^4}{4} - \\frac{v^5}{5} \\right]_0^{0.4} = \\frac{0.4^4}{4} - \\frac{0.4^5}{5}\n$$\n$$\n= 0.4^4 \\left( \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{0.4}{5} \\right) = 0.4^4 (0.25 - 0.08) = 0.17 \\cdot 0.4^4\n$$\nSubstituting these back into the expression for $N$:\n$$\nN = \\frac{1}{0.4^3} [0.13 \\cdot 0.4^4 + 0.17 \\cdot 0.4^4] = \\frac{0.4^4}{0.4^3} (0.13 + 0.17) = 0.4 (0.30) = 0.12\n$$\nFinally, we compute the centroid:\n$$\nx^{\\star}_{\\text{ext}} = \\frac{N}{D} = \\frac{0.12}{0.2} = 0.6\n$$\nThe explicit calculation confirms the result obtained from the symmetry argument.
