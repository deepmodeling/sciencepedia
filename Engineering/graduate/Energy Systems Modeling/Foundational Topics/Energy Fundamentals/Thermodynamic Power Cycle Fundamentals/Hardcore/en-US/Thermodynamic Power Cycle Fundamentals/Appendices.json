The thermal efficiency of the real cycle is $\\eta_{\\mathrm{real}} = 1 - Q_{C,\\mathrm{real}}/Q_{H,\\mathrm{real}} = 1 - 750/1000 = 0.25$. The maximum possible efficiency (Carnot efficiency) is $\\eta_{\\mathrm{Carnot}} = 1 - T_{C}/T_{H} = 1 - 300/1000 = 0.7$. Since $\\eta_{\\mathrm{real}} < \\eta_{\\mathrm{Carnot}}$, the proposed real cycle is thermodynamically possible and does not violate the Second Law.\n- The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\n**Derivation of Maximum Work Output ($W_{\\max}$)**\n\nThe First Law of Thermodynamics for a system undergoing a cycle states that the net work done by the system, $W$, is equal to the net heat transfer into the system, $Q_{\\mathrm{net}}$.\n$$W = Q_{\\mathrm{net}}$$\nFor a heat engine operating between two thermal reservoirs, one hot and one cold, the net heat transfer is the difference between the heat absorbed from the hot reservoir, $Q_{H}$, and the heat rejected to the cold reservoir, $Q_{C}$. We define both $Q_{H}$ and $Q_{C}$ as positive quantities.\n$$W = Q_{H} - Q_{C}$$\nThis equation is a direct consequence of the First Law (conservation of energy) applied to a cyclic process.\n\nThe Second Law of Thermodynamics, expressed by the Clausius inequality, provides a constraint on any thermodynamic cycle:\n$$\\oint \\frac{\\delta Q}{T} \\le 0$$\nwhere the equality holds for a reversible cycle and the inequality holds for an irreversible cycle. For a heat engine that exchanges heat only with two reservoirs at constant temperatures $T_{H}$ and $T_{C}$, this integral simplifies to a sum of two terms:\n$$\\frac{Q_{H}}{T_{H}} - \\frac{Q_{C}}{T_{C}} \\le 0$$\nThe first term is positive as heat $Q_{H}$ is added to the system at temperature $T_{H}$. The second term is negative as heat $Q_{C}$ is removed from the system at temperature $T_{C}$.\n\nRearranging the Clausius inequality, we find a lower bound for the heat rejected, $Q_{C}$:\n$$\\frac{Q_{C}}{T_{C}} \\ge \\frac{Q_{H}}{T_{H}}$$\n$$Q_{C} \\ge Q_{H} \\frac{T_{C}}{T_{H}}$$\nNow, we substitute this inequality into the First Law expression for work, $W = Q_{H} - Q_{C}$:\n$$W = Q_{H} - Q_{C} \\le Q_{H} - Q_{H} \\frac{T_{C}}{T_{H}}$$\nThe work output, $W$, is maximized when the heat rejected, $Q_{C}$, is minimized. The minimum possible value of $Q_{C}$ is achieved in a reversible cycle, for which the equality in the Clausius statement holds:\n$$Q_{C, \\mathrm{min}} = Q_{C, \\mathrm{rev}} = Q_{H} \\frac{T_{C}}{T_{H}}$$\nSubstituting this minimum heat rejection into the work equation gives the maximum possible work output, $W_{\\max}$, for a given heat input $Q_{H}$ and reservoir temperatures $T_{H}$ and $T_{C}$.\n$$W_{\\max} = Q_{H} - Q_{C, \\mathrm{min}} = Q_{H} - Q_{H} \\frac{T_{C}}{T_{H}}$$\nThus, the expression for the maximum theoretically attainable work output is:\n$$W_{\\max} = Q_{H} \\left(1 - \\frac{T_{C}}{T_{H}}\\right)$$\nThis corresponds to the work output of a reversible (Carnot) engine.\n\n**Calculation of Second-Law Efficiency ($\\eta_{\\mathrm{II}}$)**\n\nThe second-law efficiency, $\\eta_{\\mathrm{II}}$, is defined as the ratio of the actual work output, $W_{\\mathrm{real}}$, to the maximum possible work output, $W_{\\max}$.\n$$\\eta_{\\mathrm{II}} = \\frac{W_{\\mathrm{real}}}{W_{\\max}}$$\nFirst, we calculate the actual work output of the proposed real cycle using the First Law:\n$$W_{\\mathrm{real}} = Q_{H,\\mathrm{real}} - Q_{C,\\mathrm{real}}$$\nUsing the given values:\n$$W_{\\mathrm{real}} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{kJ} - 750\\ \\mathrm{kJ} = 250\\ \\mathrm{kJ}$$\nNext, we calculate the maximum possible work output for an engine that absorbs the same amount of heat, $Q_{H} = Q_{H,\\mathrm{real}} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{kJ}$, operating between the given temperatures $T_{H} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{K}$ and $T_{C} = 300\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n$$W_{\\max} = Q_{H} \\left(1 - \\frac{T_{C}}{T_{H}}\\right)$$\n$$W_{\\max} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{kJ} \\left(1 - \\frac{300\\ \\mathrm{K}}{1000\\ \\mathrm{K}}\\right) = 1000\\ \\mathrm{kJ} (1 - 0.3) = 1000\\ \\mathrm{kJ} (0.7) = 700\\ \\mathrm{kJ}$$\nFinally, we compute the second-law efficiency:\n$$\\eta_{\\mathrm{II}} = \\frac{W_{\\mathrm{real}}}{W_{\\max}} = \\frac{250\\ \\mathrm{kJ}}{700\\ \\mathrm{kJ}} = \\frac{25}{70} = \\frac{5}{14}$$\nTo express this as a decimal rounded to $4$ significant figures:\n$$\\eta_{\\mathrm{II}} \\approx 0.3571428...$$\nRounding gives:\n$$\\eta_{\\mathrm{II}} = 0.3571$$",

The specific work done *on* the fluid by the pump, $w_p$, is the negative of the shaft work done *by* the fluid, i.e., $w_p = -w_s$. The SFEE thus simplifies to:\n$$\nw_p = h_{1} - h_{0}\n$$\nThe pump is also specified as internally reversible. An adiabatic and internally reversible process is isentropic, meaning the specific entropy $s$ remains constant: $s_1 = s_0$, or $ds = 0$.\n\nWe use the fundamental property relation (Gibbs equation) for enthalpy, $dh = Tds + vdp$. For an isentropic process ($ds=0$), this becomes:\n$$\ndh = vdp\n$$\nIntegrating this from the inlet state ($0$) to the outlet state ($1$) gives the specific enthalpy change, and thus the pump work:\n$$\nw_p = h_{1} - h_{0} = \\int_{p_{0}}^{p_{1}} v \\, dp\n$$\nThe leading-order approximation for the specific pump work, $w_{\\text{approx}}$, is obtained by assuming the liquid is incompressible, i.e., its specific volume $v$ is constant and equal to the inlet value $v_{0}$. The integral then becomes:\n$$\nw_{\\text{approx}} = v_{0} \\int_{p_{0}}^{p_{1}} dp = v_{0} (p_{1} - p_{0})\n$$\nThis completes the first task.\n\n**Task 2: Calculation of the enthalpy rise and fractional error**\n\nTo compute a more accurate value for the enthalpy change, we must account for the variation of the specific volume $v$ along the isentropic path of integration. The specific volume is given as a function of pressure $p$ and temperature $T$:\n$$\nv(p, T) = v_{0} \\left[ 1 - \\kappa_{T} (p - p_{0}) + \\alpha (T - T_{0}) \\right]\n$$\nTo evaluate the integral for $h_1-h_0$, we need to find how temperature $T$ varies with pressure $p$ along an isentrope. The total differential of specific entropy $s(T, p)$ is:\n$$\nds = \\left(\\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial T}\\right)_p dT + \\left(\\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial p}\\right)_T dp\n$$\nFor an isentropic process, $ds=0$. We use the thermodynamic relations $\\left(\\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial T}\\right)_p = \\frac{c_p}{T}$ and the Maxwell relation (from $dg = -s dT + v dp$) $\\left(\\frac{\\partial s}{\\partial p}\\right)_T = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial T}\\right)_p$. Substituting these into the entropy differential gives:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{c_p}{T} dT - \\left(\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial T}\\right)_p dp \\implies \\left(\\frac{dT}{dp}\\right)_s = \\frac{T}{c_p} \\left(\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial T}\\right)_p\n$$\nFrom the given property model for $v(p,T)$, we find the partial derivative:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial T}\\right)_p = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\left[ v_{0} \\left( 1 - \\kappa_{T} (p - p_{0}) + \\alpha (T - T_{0}) \\right) \\right] = v_{0} \\alpha\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the isentropic slope gives:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{dT}{dp}\\right)_s = \\frac{T v_{0} \\alpha}{c_p}\n$$\nTo solve for the path $T(p)$, we work to leading order as instructed, which means we can approximate the coefficient $T$ on the right-hand side by its initial value $T_{0}$, since the temperature change is small. The specific heat $c_p$ is given as constant.\n$$\n\\frac{dT}{dp} \\approx \\frac{T_{0} v_{0} \\alpha}{c_p}\n$$\nIntegrating this from $(p_{0}, T_{0})$ to a state $(p, T)$ on the isentrope:\n$$\n\\int_{T_{0}}^{T} dT' = \\int_{p_{0}}^{p} \\frac{T_{0} v_{0} \\alpha}{c_p} dp' \\implies T(p) - T_{0} = \\frac{T_{0} v_{0} \\alpha}{c_p} (p - p_{0})\n$$\nNow we substitute this expression for the temperature change back into the model for specific volume to find $v$ as a function of $p$ along the isentrope:\n$$\nv(p, T(p)) = v_{0} \\left[ 1 - \\kappa_{T} (p - p_{0}) + \\alpha (T(p) - T_{0}) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nv(p, T(p)) = v_{0} \\left[ 1 - \\kappa_{T} (p - p_{0}) + \\alpha \\left(\\frac{T_{0} v_{0} \\alpha}{c_p} (p - p_{0})\\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nv(p, T(p)) = v_{0} \\left[ 1 + \\left(\\frac{T_{0} v_{0} \\alpha^2}{c_p} - \\kappa_{T}\\right) (p - p_{0}) \\right]\n$$\nWith this linearized expression for $v$ along the path, we can compute the line integral for the \"exact\" enthalpy change, $h_1-h_0$:\n$$\nh_{1} - h_{0} = \\int_{p_{0}}^{p_{1}} v_{0} \\left[ 1 + \\left(\\frac{T_{0} v_{0} \\alpha^2}{c_p} - \\kappa_{T}\\right) (p - p_{0}) \\right] dp\n$$\nThe integration is straightforward:\n$$\nh_{1} - h_{0} = v_{0} \\left[ (p - p_{0}) + \\left(\\frac{T_{0} v_{0} \\alpha^2}{c_p} - \\kappa_{T}\\right) \\frac{(p - p_{0})^2}{2} \\right]_{p_{0}}^{p_{1}}\n$$\n$$\nh_{1} - h_{0} = v_{0} (p_{1} - p_{0}) + \\frac{v_{0}}{2} \\left(\\frac{T_{0} v_{0} \\alpha^2}{c_p} - \\kappa_{T}\\right) (p_{1} - p_{0})^2\n$$\nThe fractional error $\\varepsilon$ is defined as:\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\frac{w_{\\text{approx}} - (h_{1} - h_{0})}{h_{1} - h_{0}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $w_{\\text{approx}} = v_{0} (p_{1} - p_{0})$ and $h_{1} - h_{0}$:\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\frac{v_{0} (p_{1} - p_{0}) - \\left[ v_{0} (p_{1} - p_{0}) + \\frac{v_{0}}{2} \\left(\\frac{T_{0} v_{0} \\alpha^2}{c_p} - \\kappa_{T}\\right) (p_{1} - p_{0})^2 \\right]}{v_{0} (p_{1} - p_{0}) + \\frac{v_{0}}{2} \\left(\\frac{T_{0} v_{0} \\alpha^2}{c_p} - \\kappa_{T}\\right) (p_{1} - p_{0})^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\frac{- \\frac{v_{0}}{2} \\left(\\frac{T_{0} v_{0} \\alpha^2}{c_p} - \\kappa_{T}\\right) (p_{1} - p_{0})^2}{v_{0} (p_{1} - p_{0}) \\left[ 1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{T_{0} v_{0} \\alpha^2}{c_p} - \\kappa_{T}\\right) (p_{1} - p_{0}) \\right]}\n$$\n$$\n\\varepsilon = \\frac{- \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{T_{0} v_{0} \\alpha^2}{c_p} - \\kappa_{T}\\right) (p_{1} - p_{0})}{1 + \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{T_{0} v_{0} \\alpha^2}{c_p} - \\kappa_{T}\\right) (p_{1} - p_{0})}\n$$\nLet's define the correction term $X = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{T_{0} v_{0} \\alpha^2}{c_p} - \\kappa_{T}\\right) (p_{1} - p_{0})$.
