            "solution": "The problem is valid as it represents a standard, well-posed economic dispatch problem in energy systems, grounded in established principles of optimization and economics. All necessary data are provided, and the premises are scientifically sound and internally consistent.\n\nPart (a): Convexity Analysis and Uniqueness\n\nThe fuel cost function is given as $c(p) = a p^{2} + b p$ for $p \\in \\mathbb{R}$, with the parameter $a > 0$. The function is stated to be twice continuously differentiable. To determine its convexity, we analyze its Hessian matrix. For a scalar function of a single variable, the Hessian is a $1 \\times 1$ matrix containing the second derivative. A function $f(x)$ is convex if its Hessian is positive semi-definite and strictly convex if its Hessian is positive definite. For a single-variable function, this condition simplifies to its second derivative being non-negative ($f''(x) \\ge 0$) for convexity, and strictly positive ($f''(x) > 0$) for strict convexity.\n\nFirst, we compute the first and second derivatives of the cost function $c(p)$ with respect to $p$:\nThe first derivative, which represents the marginal cost, is:\n$$ c'(p) = \\frac{d}{dp}(a p^{2} + b p) = 2ap + b $$\nThe second derivative is:\n$$ c''(p) = \\frac{d}{dp}(2ap + b) = 2a $$\nThe Hessian of $c(p)$ is the $1 \\times 1$ matrix $[c''(p)] = [2a]$. A matrix is positive definite if all its leading principal minors are positive. For a $1 \\times 1$ matrix $[m]$, this condition is simply $m > 0$.\nGiven the problem statement specifies $a > 0$, the second derivative $c''(p) = 2a$ is a positive constant.\n$$ c''(p) = 2a > 0 $$\nSince the second derivative is strictly positive for all values of $p$, the cost function $c(p)$ is strictly convex.\n\nNow, we consider the effect of this on the uniqueness of the optimizer for the profit function $\\pi(p) = \\lambda p - c(p)$. The optimization problem is to maximize $\\pi(p)$ over the convex feasible set $[0, P_{\\max}]$. Maximizing $\\pi(p)$ is equivalent to minimizing its negative, let's call this function $f(p)$:\n$$ f(p) = -\\pi(p) = -(\\lambda p - c(p)) = c(p) - \\lambda p $$\nThe function $f(p)$ is the sum of a strictly convex function $c(p)$ and a linear function $-\\lambda p$. The sum of a strictly convex function and a linear function is also strictly convex. To verify, we can check the second derivative of $f(p)$:\n$$ f''(p) = \\frac{d^2}{dp^2}(c(p) - \\lambda p) = c''(p) - 0 = 2a $$\nSince $a > 0$, we have $f''(p) > 0$, which confirms that $f(p)$ is a strictly convex function.\n\nA fundamental theorem in optimization states that if a function is strictly convex, it can have at most one global minimizer. The optimization problem is to find a minimizer of the strictly convex function $f(p)$ over the feasible set $S = [0, P_{\\max}]$. The set $S$ is non-empty, closed, and convex. The existence of a minimizer is guaranteed by the Extreme Value Theorem, as $f(p)$ is continuous and the set $S$ is compact (closed and bounded). Because the function is strictly convex and a minimizer is known to exist, that minimizer must be unique. Therefore, there is a unique power output $p^{\\ast}$ that minimizes $f(p) = -\\pi(p)$, and thus uniquely maximizes the profit $\\pi(p)$.\n\nPart (b): Calculation of the Optimal Dispatch\n\nThe problem is to find $p^{\\ast}$ that solves:\n$$ \\max_{p} \\pi(p) = \\lambda p - (a p^{2} + b p) $$\nsubject to the constraint $0 \\le p \\le P_{\\max}$.\n\nThe profit function is $\\pi(p) = -a p^{2} + (\\lambda - b) p$. This is a quadratic function of $p$. Since $a > 0$, the coefficient of the $p^2$ term is negative, meaning the graph of $\\pi(p)$ is a downward-opening parabola. The global maximum of such a function, without constraints, occurs where its first derivative is zero.\n\nThe first-order condition for an unconstrained maximum is $\\pi'(p) = 0$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\pi}{dp} = \\frac{d}{dp}(-a p^{2} + (\\lambda - b) p) = -2ap + (\\lambda - b) = 0 $$\nSolving for the unconstrained optimal dispatch, which we denote as $p_{uc}$:\n$$ 2ap_{uc} = \\lambda - b $$\n$$ p_{uc} = \\frac{\\lambda - b}{2a} $$\nThe value $p_{uc}$ represents the vertex of the parabola. The optimal solution $p^{\\ast}$ for the constrained problem is found by considering the position of $p_{uc}$ relative to the feasible interval $[0, P_{\\max}]$.\n1. If $p_{uc}$ falls within the interval, i.e., $0 \\le p_{uc} \\le P_{\\max}$, then the constrained optimum is $p^{\\ast} = p_{uc}$.\n2. If $p_{uc} < 0$, the profit function is decreasing over the entire feasible interval $[0, P_{\\max}]$. The maximum profit is achieved at the lower bound, so $p^{\\ast} = 0$.\n3. If $p_{uc} > P_{\\max}$, the profit function is increasing over the entire feasible interval $[0, P_{\\max}]$. The maximum profit is achieved at the upper bound, so $p^{\\ast} = P_{\\max}$.\n\nThis can be concisely expressed as projecting $p_{uc}$ onto the feasible set: $p^{\\ast} = \\max(0, \\min(p_{uc}, P_{\\max}))$.\n\nNow we substitute the given numerical values: $a = 0.33$, $b = 3.10$, $\\lambda = 14.70$, and $P_{\\max} = 50$.\nFirst, calculate the unconstrained optimum $p_{uc}$:\n$$ p_{uc} = \\frac{14.70 - 3.10}{2 \\times 0.33} = \\frac{11.60}{0.66} $$\n$$ p_{uc} \\approx 17.5757... $$\nNext, we check this value against the constraints. The feasible interval is $[0, 50]$. Since $0 \\le 17.5757... \\le 50$, the unconstrained maximum lies within the feasible region.\nTherefore, the unique profit-maximizing dispatch is $p^{\\ast} = p_{uc}$.\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ p^{\\ast} = 17.5757... \\, \\text{MW} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$ p^{\\ast} = 17.58 \\, \\text{MW} $$",

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in electrical power system analysis that requires the derivation and comparison of the exact AC power flow equation and its linearized DC approximation for a lossless transmission line. All necessary data and fundamental equations are provided, and the objective is clear and formalizable.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three steps: first, the derivation of the exact, nonlinear expression for real power flow ($P_{ij}^{\\mathrm{AC}}$); second, the derivation of the linearized, approximate expression for real power flow ($P_{ij}^{\\mathrm{DC}}$) by applying standard simplifying assumptions; and third, the computation of the absolute discrepancy between these two models for the provided test cases.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Exact Real Power Flow ($P_{ij}^{\\mathrm{AC}}$)**\n\nThe analysis begins with the fundamental definitions for complex power and current in an AC circuit. The complex power flowing from bus $i$ towards bus $j$, denoted $S_{ij}$, is defined as:\n$$S_{ij} = P_{ij} + \\mathbf{j}Q_{ij} = V_i I_{ij}^*$$\nwhere $P_{ij}$ is the real power, $Q_{ij}$ is the reactive power, $V_i$ is the complex voltage at bus $i$, and $I_{ij}^*$ is the complex conjugate of the current $I_{ij}$ flowing from bus $i$ to bus $j$. The imaginary unit is $\\mathbf{j} = \\sqrt{-1}$.\n\nThe current $I_{ij}$ is given by the phasor form of Ohm's law:\n$$I_{ij} = Y_{ij}(V_i - V_j)$$\nwhere $Y_{ij}$ is the series admittance of the line connecting the buses. The problem specifies a purely reactive line with series reactance $x$. The series impedance is therefore $Z_{ij} = \\mathbf{j}x$. The admittance is the reciprocal of the impedance:\n$$Y_{ij} = \\frac{1}{Z_{ij}} = \\frac{1}{\\mathbf{j}x} = -\\frac{\\mathbf{j}}{x}$$\n\nSubstituting this admittance into the current equation gives:\n$$I_{ij} = -\\frac{\\mathbf{j}}{x}(V_i - V_j)$$\n\nNext, we find the complex conjugate of the current, $I_{ij}^*$:\n$$I_{ij}^* = \\left(-\\frac{\\mathbf{j}}{x}(V_i - V_j)\\right)^* = \\left(-\\frac{\\mathbf{j}}{x}\\right)^* (V_i - V_j)^* = \\frac{\\mathbf{j}}{x}(V_i^* - V_j^*)$$\n\nNow, we substitute $I_{ij}^*$ into the complex power equation:\n$$S_{ij} = V_i \\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{j}}{x}(V_i^* - V_j^*)\\right) = \\frac{\\mathbf{j}}{x}(V_i V_i^* - V_i V_j^*)$$\n\nThe product of a complex number and its conjugate is the square of its magnitude, so $V_i V_i^* = |V_i|^2$. The complex voltages are given in polar form as $V_i = |V_i| e^{\\mathbf{j}\\theta_i}$ and $V_j = |V_j| e^{\\mathbf{j}\\theta_j}$. The term $V_i V_j^*$ can be expressed as:\n$$V_i V_j^* = \\left(|V_i| e^{\\mathbf{j}\\theta_i}\\right) \\left(|V_j| e^{-\\mathbf{j}\\theta_j}\\right) = |V_i||V_j| e^{\\mathbf{j}(\\theta_i - \\theta_j)}$$\n\nUsing Euler's formula, $e^{\\mathbf{j}\\phi} = \\cos(\\phi) + \\mathbf{j}\\sin(\\phi)$, we expand this term:\n$$V_i V_j^* = |V_i||V_j| \\left(\\cos(\\theta_i - \\theta_j) + \\mathbf{j}\\sin(\\theta_i - \\theta_j)\\right)$$\n\nSubstituting these expressions back into the equation for $S_{ij}$:\n$$S_{ij} = \\frac{\\mathbf{j}}{x} \\left( |V_i|^2 - |V_i||V_j| \\left(\\cos(\\theta_i - \\theta_j) + \\mathbf{j}\\sin(\\theta_i - \\theta_j)\\right) \\right)$$\n$$S_{ij} = \\frac{\\mathbf{j}}{x}|V_i|^2 - \\frac{\\mathbf{j}}{x}|V_i||V_j|\\cos(\\theta_i - \\theta_j) - \\frac{\\mathbf{j}^2}{x}|V_i||V_j|\\sin(\\theta_i - \\theta_j)$$\n\nSince $\\mathbf{j}^2 = -1$, the equation simplifies to:\n$$S_{ij} = \\frac{|V_i||V_j|}{x}\\sin(\\theta_i - \\theta_j) + \\mathbf{j}\\left(\\frac{|V_i|^2}{x} - \\frac{|V_i||V_j|}{x}\\cos(\\theta_i - \\theta_j)\\right)$$\n\nThe real power flow, $P_{ij}^{\\mathrm{AC}}$, is the real part of $S_{ij}$.\n$$P_{ij}^{\\mathrm{AC}} = \\mathrm{Re}\\{S_{ij}\\} = \\frac{|V_i||V_j|}{x}\\sin(\\theta_i - \\theta_j)$$\nThis is the exact, nonlinear expression for real power flow over a lossless transmission line.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Linearized DC Power Flow ($P_{ij}^{\\mathrm{DC}}$)**\n\nThe DC power flow model is a linearization of the AC power flow equations based on a set of standard assumptions for high-voltage transmission systems operating under normal conditions. The assumptions are:\n(i) Voltage magnitudes are approximately unity in per-unit: $|V_i| \\approx 1$ and $|V_j| \\approx 1$.\n(ii) Voltage angle differences between connected buses are small: $(\\theta_i - \\theta_j)$ is small, which allows the approximation $\\sin(\\theta_i - \\theta_j) \\approx (\\theta_i - \\theta_j)$ and $\\cos(\\theta_i - \\theta_j) \\approx 1$. The angles must be in radians for this approximation to be valid.\n(iii) Line resistance is negligible compared to reactance ($r \\ll x$), which was already incorporated into our model by setting the line impedance to $Z_{ij} = \\mathbf{j}x$.\n\nApplying assumptions (i) and (ii) to the exact real power flow equation:\n$$P_{ij}^{\\mathrm{AC}} = \\frac{|V_i||V_j|}{x}\\sin(\\theta_i - \\theta_j)$$\n$$P_{ij}^{\\mathrm{DC}} \\approx \\frac{(1)(1)}{x}(\\theta_i - \\theta_j)$$\nThis yields the linearized DC power flow equation:\n$$P_{ij}^{\\mathrm{DC}} = \\frac{\\theta_i - \\theta_j}{x}$$\nThis expression is linear in the state variables $\\theta_i$ and $\\theta_j$.\n\n**3.

The convex hull, denoted $\\text{conv}(\\mathcal{F})$, is a polyhedron whose vertices are precisely the points in $\\mathcal{F}$.\n\nWe seek a set of linear inequalities in terms of $u_{t-1}$, $u_t$, and $s_t$ that define this polyhedron.

The feasible points are $(1, u_t, 0)$ for $u_t \\in [0,1]$. The vertices are at the endpoints: $(1,0,0)$ and $(1,1,0)$. Both are points in $\\mathcal{F}$.\n\n- **Case 2: $u_t$ is fixed at an endpoint.**\n  - If $u_t=0$, the inequalities become $s_t \\ge -u_{t-1}$, $s_t \\le 0$, and $s_t \\le 1 - u_{t-1}$. This forces $s_t = 0$. The other two conditions are $0 \\ge -u_{t-1}$ (i.e., $u_{t-1} \\ge 0$) and $0 \\le 1 - u_{t-1}$ (i.e., $u_{t-1} \\le 1$), which are given. The feasible points are $(u_{t-1}, 0, 0)$ for $u_{t-1} \\in [0,1]$. Vertices are $(0,0,0)$ and $(1,0,0)$.\n  - If $u_t=1$, the inequalities are $s_t \\ge 1 - u_{t-1}$, $s_t \\le 1$, and $s_t \\le 1 - u_{t-1}$. This forces $s_t = 1 - u_{t-1}$. The feasible points are $(u_{t-1}, 1, 1-u_{t-1})$ for $u_{t-1} \\in [0,1]$. Vertices are at $(0,1,1)$ and $(1,1,0)$.\n\nSince any vertex of the polyhedron $\\mathcal{P}$ must have at least one of $u_{t-1}$ or $u_t$ at an endpoint value of $0$ or $1$, we have shown that all vertices of $\\mathcal{P}$ are the integer points in $\\mathcal{F}$. Thus, the formulation is tight.\n\nThe MILP formulation for the startup indicators $s_t$ for $t \\in \\{1, \\dots, T\\}$ is:\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\ns_t &\\ge u_t - u_{t-1} \\\\\ns_t &\\le u_t \\\\\ns_t &\\le 1 - u_{t-1} \\\\\nu_t, s_t &\\in \\{0,1\\}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nwhere $u_0$ is a given initial condition.\n\n### Part 2: Equivalence with Nonlinear Representation\n\nThe nonlinear representation of startup events is given by the piecewise function $s_t = \\max\\{0, u_t - u_{t-1}\\}$. Let's verify that this function correctly identifies startups for binary inputs:\n- If $(u_{t-1}, u_t) = (0,0)$, $s_t = \\max\\{0, 0-0\\} = 0$.\n- If $(u_{t-1}, u_t) = (0,1)$, $s_t = \\max\\{0, 1-0\\} = 1$.\n- If $(u_{t-1}, u_t) = (1,0)$, $s_t = \\max\\{0, 0-1\\} = 0$.\n- If $(u_{t-1}, u_t) = (1,1)$, $s_t = \\max\\{0, 1-1\\} = 0$.\nThe function correctly evaluates to $1$ only in the case of a startup.\n\nNow we demonstrate the equivalence in an optimization context with an objective function term $\\sum_{t=1}^{T} c^{\\mathrm{SU}} s_t$ to be minimized, where $c^{\\mathrm{SU}} > 0$. The optimizer will attempt to make each $s_t$ as small as possible while satisfying the constraints.\n\nFrom the linear formulation, the constraint $s_t \\ge u_t - u_{t-1}$ combined with the non-negativity of $s_t$ (either by $s_t \\ge 0$ or by its binary nature) establishes a lower bound for $s_t$:\n$$\ns_t \\ge \\max\\{0, u_t - u_{t-1}\\}\n$$\nSince the objective function is minimizing a positive multiple of $s_t$, the optimizer will always push $s_t$ to its minimum feasible value, which is exactly this lower bound. Therefore, in an optimal solution, $s_t$ will be set to $s_t = \\max\\{0, u_t - u_{t-1}\\}$.\n\nThe other two inequalities, $s_t \\le u_t$ and $s_t \\le 1-u_{t-1}$, remain satisfied by this choice of $s_t$. For example, considering $s_t \\le u_t$:\n- If $u_t - u_{t-1} > 0$, then $s_t = u_t - u_{t-1}$. The inequality is $u_t - u_{t-1} \\le u_t$, which simplifies to $-u_{t-1} \\le 0$, which is always true.\n- If $u_t - u_{t-1} \\le 0$, then $s_t = 0$. The inequality is $0 \\le u_t$, which is always true.\n\nA similar argument shows $s_t \\le 1-u_{t-1}$ is also always satisfied. While these two inequalities are essential for defining the convex hull (tightness), they are redundant for finding the optimal value of $s_t$ in a cost minimization problem, as they are never the active constraints that determine the optimal value of $s_t$.\n\nThus, both the tight linear formulation (embedded in a minimization problem) and the nonlinear function yield the same value for $s_t$ for any given pair $(u_{t-1}, u_t)$, and consequently result in identical total startup costs.\n\n### Part 3: Calculation for Specific Scenario\n\nWe are given:\n- Time horizon $T = 10$.\n- Initial commitment $u_0 = 0$.\n- Startup cost $c^{\\mathrm{SU}} = 3{,}000$.\n- Commitment sequence $(u_1, u_2, \\dots, u_{10}) = (0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0)$.\n\nThe total startup cost is $C_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{t=1}^{T} c^{\\mathrm{SU}} s_t = c^{\\mathrm{SU}} \\sum_{t=1}^{T} s_t$.\nWe need to count the number of startups, which are transitions from $u_{t-1}=0$ to $u_t=1$. Let's examine the sequence period by period:\n- $t=1$: $(u_0, u_1) = (0, 0) \\implies$ No startup. $s_1=0$.\n- $t=2$: $(u_1, u_2) = (0, 1) \\implies$ **Startup**. $s_2=1$.\n- $t=3$: $(u_2, u_3) = (1, 1) \\implies$ No startup. $s_3=0$.\n- $t=4$: $(u_3, u_4) = (1, 0) \\implies$ No startup. $s_4=0$.\n- $t=5$: $(u_4, u_5) = (0, 0) \\implies$ No startup. $s_5=0$.\n- $t=6$: $(u_5, u_6) = (0, 1) \\implies$ **Startup**. $s_6=1$.\n- $t=7$: $(u_6, u_7) = (1, 0) \\implies$ No startup. $s_7=0$.\n- $t=8$: $(u_7, u_8) = (0, 1) \\implies$ **Startup**. $s_8=1$.\n- $t=9$: $(u_8, u_9) = (1, 1) \\implies$ No startup. $s_9=0$.\n- $t=10$: $(u_9, u_{10}) = (1, 0) \\implies$ No startup. $s_{10}=0$.\n\nThe total number of startups is $\\sum_{t=1}^{10} s_t = s_2 + s_6 + s_8 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3$.\n\nThe total startup cost is:\n$$\nC_{\\text{total}} = c^{\\mathrm{SU}} \\times (\\text{Total number of startups}) = 3000 \\times 3 = 9000\n$$\nThe cost is $\\$9000$. This is an exact integer value, so no rounding is necessary.",
