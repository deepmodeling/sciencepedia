The final answer must be a single real number with no units in the box.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the shadow price of the nodal balance constraint at node B. This is equivalent to finding the value of the dual variable associated with this constraint in the context of a cost-minimization linear program (LP).\n\nFirst, we formulate the primal LP. Let the decision variables be:\n- $g_A$: The power generated at node A in megawatts (MW).\n- $g_B$: The power generated at node B in megawatts (MW).\n- $f_{AB}$: The power flow from node A to node B in megawatts (MW). A positive value indicates flow from A to B, and a negative value indicates flow from B to A.\n\nThe objective is to minimize the total generation cost, $Z$, which is a linear function of the generation levels:\n$$\n\\text{Minimize } Z = 20 g_A + 50 g_B\n$$\n\nThis minimization is subject to several constraints:\n\n1.  **Nodal Power Balance**: At each node, power generation plus inflow must equal power demand plus outflow.\n    -   Node A: $g_A = d_A + f_{AB}$. Given $d_A = 120$, this is $g_A - f_{AB} = 120$.\n    -   Node B: $g_B + f_{AB} = d_B$. Given $d_B = 60$, this is $g_B + f_{AB} = 60$.\n\n2.  **Generator Capacity Limits**: The output of each generator cannot exceed its capacity, and must be non-negative.\n    -   $0 \\le g_A \\le \\bar{g}_A$, where $\\bar{g}_A = 200$. So, $0 \\le g_A \\le 200$.\n    -   $0 \\le g_B \\le \\bar{g}_B$, where $\\bar{g}_B = 100$. So, $0 \\le g_B \\le 100$.\n\n3.  **Transmission Capacity Limits**: The power flow on the line between A and B cannot exceed its capacity in either direction.\n    -   $-\\bar{f} \\le f_{AB} \\le \\bar{f}$, where $\\bar{f} = 30$. So, $-30 \\le f_{AB} \\le 30$.\n\nTo find the optimal solution to this primal problem, we observe that generation at node A is cheaper ($20 \\$/\\mathrm{MWh}$) than at node B ($50 \\$/\\mathrm{MWh}$). The system will therefore attempt to maximize the use of generator A to serve the total demand of $d_A + d_B = 120 + 60 = 180$ MW. If transmission were unlimited, the optimal solution would be $g_A = 180$ MW and $g_B = 0$ MW. This would require a flow $f_{AB}$ to satisfy the nodal balances:\n- Node A: $180 = 120 + f_{AB} \\implies f_{AB} = 60$ MW.\n- Node B: $0 + f_{AB} = 60 \\implies f_{AB} = 60$ MW.\nHowever, this flow of $60$ MW violates the transmission capacity limit of $30$ MW. The transmission line is congested. Therefore, the flow from A to B will be at its maximum capacity, $f_{AB} = 30$ MW.\n\nWith the flow fixed by the congestion, $f_{AB} = 30$ MW, we can determine the optimal generation levels:\n- From the node A balance: $g_A = 120 + f_{AB} = 120 + 30 = 150$ MW. This is feasible as $0 \\le 150 \\le 200$.\n- From the node B balance: $g_B = 60 - f_{AB} = 60 - 30 = 30$ MW. This is feasible as $0 \\le 30 \\le 100$.\n\nSo, the optimal primal solution is $g_A^* = 150$, $g_B^* = 30$, and $f_{AB}^* = 30$.\n\nTo find the shadow price, we must use LP duality. Let's define the nodal balance constraints in a standard form suitable for interpreting the dual variables as prices. Let the dual variable $\\lambda_A$ be associated with the node A balance and $\\lambda_B$ with the node B balance.\n$$\n120 + f_{AB} - g_A = 0 \\quad (\\lambda_A)\n$$\n$$\n60 - f_{AB} - g_B = 0 \\quad (\\lambda_B)\n$$\nWith this formulation, the dual variable $\\lambda_B$ represents the sensitivity of the optimal cost to a change in the demand at node B, $\\frac{\\partial Z^*}{\\partial d_B}$, which is what the problem asks for.\n\nThe other constraints are inequalities:\n$$\ng_A - 200 \\le 0 \\quad (\\mu_{A,up} \\ge 0)\n$$\n$$\n-g_A \\le 0 \\quad (\\mu_{A,low} \\ge 0)\n$$\n$$\ng_B - 100 \\le 0 \\quad (\\mu_{B,up} \\ge 0)\n$$\n$$\n-g_B \\le 0 \\quad (\\mu_{B,low} \\ge 0)\n$$\n$$\nf_{AB} - 30 \\le 0 \\quad (\\gamma_{up} \\ge 0)\n$$\n$$\n-f_{AB} - 30 \\le 0 \\quad (\\gamma_{low} \\ge 0)\n$$\nThe Lagrangian for this problem is:\n$L = (20g_A + 50g_B) + \\lambda_A(120 + f_{AB} - g_A) + \\lambda_B(60 - f_{AB} - g_B) + \\mu_{A,up}(g_A - 200) + \\mu_{A,low}(-g_A) + \\mu_{B,up}(g_B - 100) + \\mu_{B,low}(-g_B) + \\gamma_{up}(f_{AB} - 30) + \\gamma_{low}(-f_{AB} - 30)$.\n\nThe Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions for optimality require the partial derivatives of the Lagrangian with respect to the primal variables to be zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial g_A} = 20 - \\lambda_A + \\mu_{A,up} - \\mu_{A,low} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial g_B} = 50 - \\lambda_B + \\mu_{B,up} - \\mu_{B,low} = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial f_{AB}} = \\lambda_A - \\lambda_B + \\gamma_{up} - \\gamma_{low} = 0\n$$\nThe complementary slackness conditions state that if an inequality constraint is not binding (i.e., the slack is non-zero), its corresponding dual variable must be zero. We evaluate this at the optimal primal solution $(g_A^* = 150, g_B^* = 30, f_{AB}^* = 30)$:\n- $0 < g_A^* < 200 \\implies$ both $g_A$ capacity constraints are not binding. Thus, $\\mu_{A,up} = 0$ and $\\mu_{A,low} = 0$.\n- $0 < g_B^* < 100 \\implies$ both $g_B$ capacity constraints are not binding. Thus, $\\mu_{B,up} = 0$ and $\\mu_{B,low} = 0$.\n- $f_{AB}^* = 30 \\implies$ the upper transmission limit $f_{AB} \\le 30$ is binding. Thus, $\\gamma_{up} \\ge 0$.\n- $f_{AB}^* = 30 > -30 \\implies$ the lower transmission limit $f_{AB} \\ge -30$ (or $-f_{AB} \\le 30$) is not binding. Thus, $\\gamma_{low} = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the KKT conditions:\n1.  From the $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial g_A}$ equation: $20 - \\lambda_A + 0 - 0 = 0 \\implies \\lambda_A = 20$.\n2.  From the $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial g_B}$ equation: $50 - \\lambda_B + 0 - 0 = 0 \\implies \\lambda_B = 50$.\n\nThe value of the dual variable associated with the nodal balance constraint at node B is $\\lambda_B = 50$. This value represents the marginal cost of supplying an additional megawatt-hour of electricity at node B. Since the transmission line from the cheaper source (A) is congested, any additional demand at B must be met by the local, more expensive generator (B), which has a marginal cost of $50 \\$/\\mathrm{MWh}$.\n\nAs a consistency check, we can use the third KKT condition:\n$\\lambda_A - \\lambda_B + \\gamma_{up} - \\gamma_{low} = 0 \\implies 20 - 50 + \\gamma_{up} - 0 = 0 \\implies \\gamma_{up} = 30$.\nThe value $\\gamma_{up} = 30$ is non-negative, consistent with the KKT conditions. This dual variable represents the congestion rent on the transmission line, which is equal to the difference in the locational marginal prices between the two nodes.\n\nThe shadow price of the nodal balance constraint at node B is $\\lambda_B$.",

It is optimal to incur a single startup and produce as much as possible subject to $P^{\\max}$ and $R$, starting as early as possible to exploit all negative coefficients.\n\nFrom $u_0 = 0$ and $p_0 = 0$, if we start at $t=1$ ($u_1=1$, $y_1=1$), the ramp and capability constraints yield:\n- At $t=1$: $p_1 \\in [50, \\min(200, 0 + 80)] = [50, 80]$, so choose $p_1 = 80$.\n- At $t=2$: $p_2 \\in [50, \\min(200, 80 + 80)] = [50, 160]$, so choose $p_2 = 160$.\n- At $t=3$: $p_3 \\in [50, \\min(200, 160 + 80)] = [50, 200]$, so choose $p_3 = 200$.\n- At $t=4$: $p_4 \\in [50, \\min(200, 200 + 80)] = [50, 200]$, so choose $p_4 = 200$.\n\nKeeping the unit on throughout avoids additional startups, so $\\sum_{t=1}^{4} y_t = 1$. The objective value under this schedule is\n\\begin{align*}\n& 500 \\cdot 1 + (-15) \\cdot 80 + (-30) \\cdot 160 + (-10) \\cdot 200 + (-20) \\cdot 200 \\\\\n&= 500 - 1200 - 4800 - 2000 - 4000 \\\\\n&= 500 - 12000 \\\\\n&= -11500.\n\\end{align*}\n\nWe briefly check alternatives to ensure optimality:\n- Staying off yields objective $0$, which is higher than $-11500$ (worse for minimization).\n- Starting later (e.g., at $t=2$) reduces exploitable negative coefficients and is constrained by ramping, yielding a less favorable objective (e.g., $-7500$).\n- Multiple startups increase $\\sum y_t$ and incur additional startup costs; given negative $c_v - \\pi_t$ coefficients, a single continuous on-period with maximal feasible outputs is superior.\n\nTherefore, the optimal reduced cost of the pricing problem is $-11500 \\ \\$$.",
