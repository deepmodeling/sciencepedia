            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of the effect of averaging two feasible charging profiles on a convex degradation cost functional and the computation of the associated Jensen gap. The analysis will proceed by first establishing the convexity of the cost functional and then performing explicit calculations for the given profiles.\n\nThe total degradation cost is defined by the functional $J(u) = \\int_{0}^{1} \\phi(u(t)) dt$, where the instantaneous cost function is $\\phi(u) = \\beta u^2$. Here, $\\beta  0$ and $u(t)$ is the charging power.\n\nFirst, we address the qualitative question by invoking the definition of convexity. The function $\\phi(u)$ is twice differentiable with respect to $u$. Its second derivative is $\\frac{d^2\\phi}{du^2} = 2\\beta$. Since $\\beta  0$, we have $\\frac{d^2\\phi}{du^2}  0$, which implies that $\\phi(u)$ is a strictly convex function of $u$.\n\nThe cost functional $J(u)$ inherits the convexity of $\\phi(u)$. For any two functions $u_a(t)$ and $u_b(t)$ in the domain of $J$, and any $\\lambda \\in [0, 1]$, the convexity of $\\phi$ implies:\n$$\n\\phi\\big((1-\\lambda)u_a(t) + \\lambda u_b(t)\\big) \\le (1-\\lambda)\\phi(u_a(t)) + \\lambda\\phi(u_b(t))\n$$\nIntegrating this inequality over the time interval $[0, 1]$ yields Jensen's inequality for the integral functional $J$:\n$$\n\\int_0^1 \\phi\\big((1-\\lambda)u_a(t) + \\lambda u_b(t)\\big) dt \\le \\int_0^1 \\big( (1-\\lambda)\\phi(u_a(t)) + \\lambda\\phi(u_b(t)) \\big) dt\n$$\n$$\nJ\\big((1-\\lambda)u_a + \\lambda u_b\\big) \\le (1-\\lambda)J(u_a) + \\lambda J(u_b)\n$$\nThe problem considers the specific case where $u_a = u_1$, $u_b = u_2$, and $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{2}$. The averaged profile is $u_{\\mathrm{avg}}(t) = \\frac{1}{2}u_1(t) + \\frac{1}{2}u_2(t)$. Applying the inequality, we get:\n$$\nJ(u_{\\mathrm{avg}}) \\le \\frac{1}{2}J(u_1) + \\frac{1}{2}J(u_2)\n$$\nSince $\\phi(u)$ is strictly convex and $u_1(t) \\neq u_2(t)$ for $t \\in [0, 1]$ (except at the single point $t=\\frac{1}{2}$), the inequality is strict.

As established, the objective function is strictly convex and the feasible region is convex. Therefore, the KKT conditions are both necessary and sufficient for global optimality.\n\nThe Lagrangian function $\\mathcal{L}$ for this problem is formulated by associating Lagrange multipliers with each constraint. Let $\\lambda$ be the multiplier for the equality constraint, $\\mu_{1,L}$ and $\\mu_{2,L}$ for the lower bound constraints ($p_1 \\ge 0, p_2 \\ge 0$), and $\\mu_{1,U}$ and $\\mu_{2,U}$ for the upper bound constraints ($p_1 \\le 100, p_2 \\le 100$).

For optimal dispatch, the incremental costs of both generators must be equal to this price. Equating the two expressions gives:\n$$ 2p_1 + 10 = 4p_2 + 6 $$\n$$ 2p_1 - 4p_2 = -4 $$\n$$ p_1 - 2p_2 = -2 $$\nWe now have a system of two linear equations with two variables, this equation and the power balance equation:\n1. $p_1 - 2p_2 = -2$\n2. $p_1 + p_2 = 50$\n\nSubtracting equation (1) from equation (2) yields:\n$$ (p_1 + p_2) - (p_1 - 2p_2) = 50 - (-2) $$\n$$ 3p_2 = 52 $$\n$$ p_2^{\\star} = \\frac{52}{3} $$\nSubstitute this value back into the power balance equation to find $p_1$:\n$$ p_1^{\\star} = 50 - p_2^{\\star} = 50 - \\frac{52}{3} = \\frac{150 - 52}{3} = \\frac{98}{3} $$\nThe proposed optimal dispatch is $\\mathbf{p}^{\\star} = \\begin{pmatrix} 98/3 \\\\ 52/3 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nFinally, we must verify if this solution is consistent with our initial assumption that no bounds are active.\nFor generator 1: $p_1^{\\star} = \\frac{98}{3} \\approx 32.67$. This value satisfies $0  32.67  100$.\nFor generator 2: $p_2^{\\star} = \\frac{52}{3} \\approx 17.33$.

It represents a non-trivial application of convex analysis.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe original cost structure is inherently non-convex due to the binary variable $u$. Let us define the effective cost function $C(p,u)$ over the non-convex domain specified by $u \\in \\{0,1\\}$ and $0 \\leq p \\leq \\overline{P}\\,u$.\nThis gives:\n$C(p,u) = \\begin{cases} p^2  \\text{if } u=1, 0 \\leq p \\leq \\overline{P} \\\\ 0  \\text{if } u=0, p=0 \\end{cases}$\nWe introduce an epigraph variable $t$ to represent the cost, such that $t \\geq C(p,u)$.

The epigraph of the convex envelope is the convex hull of the epigraph of the original function. The convex envelope itself is the function whose graph is the lower boundary of this convex hull.\n\nA powerful tool for constructing convex envelopes of functions involving a scaling variable like $u$ is the perspective transformation. Given a convex function $g(x)$, its perspective function is defined as $h(x,\\lambda) = \\lambda \\, g(x/\\lambda)$ for a scaling variable $\\lambda  0$. The function $h(x,\\lambda)$ is jointly convex in $(x,\\lambda)$.\n\nIn our problem, the base cost function for the \"on\" state ($u=1$) is $f(p)=p^2$. This is a convex function of $p$. We can identify the power output $p$ with the generic variable $x$ and the commitment variable $u$ with the scaling variable $\\lambda$.\n\nWe apply the perspective transformation to $f(p)=p^2$ with the scaling variable $u$. This gives the function for the lower envelope, which we denote $t(p,u)$:\n$$t(p,u) = u \\cdot f(p/u) = u \\left( \\frac{p}{u} \\right)^2 = \\frac{p^2}{u}$$\nThis expression is defined for $u0$. Let's analyze its properties.\n\n$1$. **Convexity**: Since $f(p)=p^2$ is a convex function, its perspective $t(p,u)=p^2/u$ is a jointly convex function of $(p,u)$ on its domain of definition, which is for $u0$.\n\n$2$. **Agreement with integer points**: We must check if this function correctly represents the cost at the integer values of $u$.\n- For $u=1$: The formula gives $t(p,1) = p^2/1 = p^2$. This exactly matches the original cost function $f(p)=p^2$ for the \"on\" state.\n- For $u=0$: The expression $p^2/u$ is undefined. However, the problem statement allows us to consider the closure of the function at $(p,u)=(0,0)$, which is well-defined by continuity. The relaxed domain requires that $0 \\leq p \\leq \\overline{P}\\,u$. As $u \\to 0^+$, this forces $p \\to 0$. We evaluate the limit of $t(p,u)$ as $(p,u)$ approaches $(0,0)$ within this domain:\n$$ \\lim_{(p,u) \\to (0,0), u0, 0 \\leq p \\leq \\overline{P}u} \\frac{p^2}{u} $$\nFrom the constraint $p \\leq \\overline{P}u$, we have $p^2 \\leq \\overline{P}^2 u^2$. Dividing by $u$ (since $u0$), we get:\n$$ 0 \\leq \\frac{p^2}{u} \\leq \\overline{P}^2 u $$\nAs $u \\to 0^+$, the term $\\overline{P}^2 u$ approaches $0$. By the Squeeze Theorem, we have:\n$$ \\lim_{(p,u) \\to (0,0), (p,u) \\in D_{rel}} t(p,u) = 0 $$\nThis limit matches the cost of the \"off\" state, $C(0,0)=0$. Therefore, the function $t(p,u)$ defined as $p^2/u$ for $u0$ and $0$ at $(p,u)=(0,0)$ is continuous on the entire relaxed domain $D_{rel}$. The function formed by this closure is convex on the convex set $D_{rel}$.\n\n$3$. **Tightest Lower Bound**: To confirm that $t(p,u) = p^2/u$ is the convex envelope (i.e., the tightest possible convex lower bound), we consider an arbitrary point $(p,u)$ in the relaxed domain $D_{rel}$ with $u \\in (0,1)$. This point can be expressed as a convex combination of two points from the original integer domain:\n$$ (p,u) = (1-u)(0,0) + u\\left(\\frac{p}{u}, 1\\right) $$\nNote that the point $(p/u, 1)$ is in the \"on\" domain, since $0 \\leq p \\leq \\overline{P}u$ implies $0 \\leq p/u \\leq \\overline{P}$ for $u0$.\nLet $\\phi(p,u)$ be any convex function that is a lower bound to the original cost function $C(p,u)$. By Jensen's inequality for convex functions, we must have:\n$$ \\phi(p,u) = \\phi\\left((1-u)(0,0) + u\\left(\\frac{p}{u}, 1\\right)\\right) \\leq (1-u)\\phi(0,0) + u\\,\\phi\\left(\\frac{p}{u}, 1\\right) $$\nSince $\\phi$ is a lower bound, $\\phi(0,0) \\leq C(0,0) = 0$ and $\\phi(p/u, 1) \\leq C(p/u, 1) = (p/u)^2$. To obtain the tightest bound, we must have equality at the integer points where the function is defined, so we consider $\\phi(0,0)=0$ and $\\phi(p/u, 1) = (p/u)^2$.\nSubstituting these into the inequality gives:\n$$ \\phi(p,u) \\leq (1-u)(0) + u\\left(\\frac{p}{u}\\right)^2 = u \\frac{p^2}{u^2} = \\frac{p^2}{u} $$\nThis shows that any convex underestimator $\\phi(p,u)$ must be less than or equal to $p^2/u$. Since our candidate function $t(p,u)=p^2/u$ is itself convex and satisfies this upper bound with equality, it must be the greatest convex lower bound, which is the definition of the convex envelope.\n\nThe resulting constraint is $t \\geq p^2/u$, which is valid for $u0$. In the context of MISOCP, this is typically rewritten as the second-order cone constraint $p^2 \\leq tu$ for $t \\geq 0, u \\geq 0$, which is equivalent to $\\|(2p, t-u)\\|_2 \\leq t+u$. This demonstrates the utility of the derived form.\n\nThe required final answer is the single closed-form expression for $t(p,u)$ valid for $u \\in (0,1]$. This is the expression derived from the perspective function.",
