            "problem": "Consider a lossless transmission network under the Direct Current (DC) power flow approximation, where voltage magnitudes are fixed at $1$ per unit and branch resistances are neglected. All bus voltage angles are measured in radians. The network has buses $\\{1,2,3\\}$ with bus $3$ serving as the reference (slack) bus with angle fixed at $0$. The lines are oriented and parameterized as follows:\n- Line $\\ell_{1}$: $1 \\rightarrow 2$ with series reactance $X_{12} = 0.25$ per unit.\n- Line $\\ell_{2}$: $2 \\rightarrow 3$ with series reactance $X_{23} = 0.20$ per unit.\n- Line $\\ell_{3}$: $1 \\rightarrow 3$ with series reactance $X_{13} = 0.40$ per unit.\n\nDefine the series susceptance of each line as $b_{ij} = 1/X_{ij}$ in per unit.

Starting from Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL) and the DC power flow relations $P_{ij} = b_{ij}(\\theta_{i} - \\theta_{j})$ across each line $(i,j)$, derive a linear mapping from the vector of net bus injections $P$ to the vector of oriented line flows $f$ by eliminating the reference bus angle. Define the resulting matrix $H$ such that $f = H P_{\\mathrm{red}}$, where $P_{\\mathrm{red}}$ collects the injections at the non-reference buses. Do not assume any pre-existing shortcut formulas; derive the mapping directly from first principles.\n2. Using the given network and choosing bus $3$ as the slack, compute the numerical entries of the Power Transfer Distribution Factor (PTDF) matrix $H$ that maps injections at buses $\\{1,2\\}$ (with the slack bus $3$ absorbing the balancing injection) to flows on the oriented lines $\\{\\ell_{1}, \\ell_{2}, \\ell_{3}\\}$.\n3.

Derivation and Computation of the PTDF Matrix $H$**\n\nThe problem provides a $3$-bus network with line reactances: $X_{12} = 0.25$ p.u., $X_{23} = 0.20$ p.u., and $X_{13} = 0.40$ p.u. The base power is $S_{\\mathrm{base}} = 100$ MW.

We apply KCL to the non-reference buses, which are bus $1$ and bus $2$. Bus $3$ is the reference bus, so its angle is fixed at $\\theta_3 = 0$.\n\nKCL at bus $1$:\n$$P_1 = P_{12} + P_{13} = b_{12}(\\theta_1 - \\theta_2) + b_{13}(\\theta_1 - \\theta_3)$$\nSubstituting the known values and $\\theta_3 = 0$:\n$$P_1 = 4(\\theta_1 - \\theta_2) + 2.5(\\theta_1 - 0) = (4+2.5)\\theta_1 - 4\\theta_2 = 6.5\\theta_1 - 4\\theta_2$$\n\nKCL at bus $2$:\n$$P_2 = P_{21} + P_{23} = -P_{12} + P_{23} = -b_{12}(\\theta_1 - \\theta_2) + b_{23}(\\theta_2 - \\theta_3)$$\nSubstituting the known values and $\\theta_3 = 0$:\n$$P_2 = -4(\\theta_1 - \\theta_2) + 5(\\theta_2 - 0) = -4\\theta_1 + (4+5)\\theta_2 = -4\\theta_1 + 9\\theta_2$$\n\nThese two linear equations can be expressed in matrix form $P_{\\mathrm{red}} = B_{\\mathrm{red}} \\theta_{\\mathrm{red}}$, where $P_{\\mathrm{red}}$ is the vector of injections at non-reference buses, $\\theta_{\\mathrm{red}}$ is the vector of angles at those buses, and $B_{\\mathrm{red}}$ is the reduced bus admittance matrix.\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} P_1 \\\\ P_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 6.5 & -4 \\\\ -4 & 9 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\theta_1 \\\\ \\theta_2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nTo find the angles as a function of the injections, we must invert the matrix $B_{\\mathrm{red}}$.\nThe determinant of $B_{\\mathrm{red}}$ is $\\det(B_{\\mathrm{red}}) = (6.5)(9) - (-4)(-4) = 58.5 - 16 = 42.5$.\nThe inverse is:\n$$B_{\\mathrm{red}}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{42.5} \\begin{pmatrix} 9 & 4 \\\\ 4 & 6.5 \\end{pmatrix}$$\nSo, the relationship between angles and injections is $\\theta_{\\mathrm{red}} = B_{\\mathrm{red}}^{-1} P_{\\mathrm{red}}$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\theta_1 \\\\ \\theta_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{42.5} \\begin{pmatrix} 9 & 4 \\\\ 4 & 6.5 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} P_1 \\\\ P_2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNext, we express the oriented line flows $f$ in terms of the bus angles. The flow vector $f$ is defined for the oriented lines $\\{\\ell_{1}, \\ell_{2}, \\ell_{3}\\}$ as $f = \\begin{pmatrix} f_1 \\\\ f_2 \\\\ f_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} P_{12} \\\\ P_{23} \\\\ P_{13} \\end{pmatrix}$.\n- $f_1 = P_{12} = b_{12}(\\theta_1 - \\theta_2) = 4\\theta_1 - 4\\theta_2$\n- $f_2 = P_{23} = b_{23}(\\theta_2 - \\theta_3) = 5(\\theta_2 - 0) = 5\\theta_2$\n- $f_3 = P_{13} = b_{13}(\\theta_1 - \\theta_3) = 2.5(\\theta_1 - 0) = 2.5\\theta_1$\n\nIn matrix form, $f = C \\theta_{\\mathrm{red}}$:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} f_1 \\\\ f_2 \\\\ f_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 4 & -4 \\\\ 0 & 5 \\\\ 2.5 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\theta_1 \\\\ \\theta_2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe PTDF matrix $H$ maps the bus injections $P_{\\mathrm{red}}$ directly to the line flows $f$, such that $f = H P_{\\mathrm{red}}$.

The first column gives the flow changes on lines $\\{\\ell_1, \\ell_2, \\ell_3\\}$ for a unit injection at bus $1$ (withdrawn at bus $3$), and the second column for a unit injection at bus $2$ (withdrawn at bus $3$).\n\n**2. Analysis of Transactions**\n\nWe convert the transaction amounts from MW to p.u. using $S_{\\mathrm{base}} = 100$ MW.\n\n**Transaction $\\mathcal{T}_{1}$**: Inject $115$ MW at bus $1$, withdraw $115$ MW at bus $3$.\nThe injection vector $P_{\\mathrm{red}}$ is:\n$P_1 = +115 \\text{ MW} = \\frac{115}{100} = 1.15$ p.u.\n$P_2 = 0$ p.u.\n$$P_{\\mathrm{red}}^{\\mathcal{T}_1} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1.15 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\text{ p.u.}$$\nThe line flows are $f^{\\mathcal{T}_1} = H P_{\\mathrm{red}}^{\\mathcal{T}_1}$:\n$$\nf^{\\mathcal{T}_1} = \\frac{1}{17} \\begin{pmatrix} 8 & -4 \\\\ 8 & 13 \\\\ 9 & 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1.15 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1.15}{17} \\begin{pmatrix} 8 \\\\ 8 \\\\ 9 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{1}{17} \\begin{pmatrix} 9.2 \\\\ 9.2 \\\\ 10.35 \\end{pmatrix} \\approx \\begin{pmatrix} 0.5412 \\\\ 0.5412 \\\\ 0.6088 \\end{pmatrix} \\text{ p.u.}\n$$\nSince all flow values are positive, the physical direction of flow on each line matches its given orientation:\n- $\\ell_{1}$: Flow is from bus $1$ to bus $2$.\n- $\\ell_{2}$: Flow is from bus $2$ to bus $3$.\n- $\\ell_{3}$: Flow is from bus $1$ to bus $3$.\n\n**Transaction $\\mathcal{T}_{2}$**: Inject $85$ MW at bus $2$, withdraw $85$ MW at bus $1$.\nThe injection vector $P_{\\mathrm{red}}$ is:\n$P_1 = -85 \\text{ MW} = \\frac{-85}{100} = -0.85$ p.u.\n$P_2 = +85 \\text{ MW} = \\frac{85}{100} = 0.85$ p.u.\n$$P_{\\mathrm{red}}^{\\mathcal{T}_2} = \\begin{pmatrix} -0.85 \\\\ 0.85 \\end{pmatrix} \\text{ p.u.}$$\nThe line flows are $f^{\\mathcal{T}_2} = H P_{\\mathrm{red}}^{\\mathcal{T}_2}$:\n$$\nf^{\\mathcal{T}_2} = \\frac{1}{17} \\begin{pmatrix} 8 & -4 \\\\ 8 & 13 \\\\ 9 & 4 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} -0.85 \\\\ 0.85 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{0.85}{17} \\begin{pmatrix} 8(-1) - 4(1) \\\\ 8(-1) + 13(1) \\\\ 9(-1) + 4(1) \\end{pmatrix} = 0.05 \\begin{pmatrix} -12 \\\\ 5 \\\\ -5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -0.6 \\\\ 0.25 \\\\ -0.25 \\end{pmatrix} \\text{ p.u.}\n$$\nThe signs of the flows indicate the physical direction:\n- $\\ell_{1}$: $f_1 < 0$. Flow is from bus $2$ to bus $1$ (opposite to orientation).\n- $\\ell_{2}$: $f_2 > 0$. Flow is from bus $2$ to bus $3$ (matches orientation).\n- $\\ell_{3}$: $f_3 < 0$. Flow is from bus $3$ to bus $1$ (opposite to orientation).\n\n**3. Superposition for Net Flow on Line $\\ell_{1}$**\n\nThe DC power flow model is linear, so we can use superposition to find the total flow on line $\\ell_{1}$ when both transactions occur simultaneously. The total p.u. flow is the sum of the flows from each transaction.\n\n$$f_{1}^{\\text{total}} = f_{1}^{\\mathcal{T}_1} + f_{1}^{\\mathcal{T}_2}$$\nFrom the previous steps, $f_{1}^{\\mathcal{T}_1} = \\frac{9.2}{17}$ p.u. and $f_{1}^{\\mathcal{T}_2} = -0.6$ p.u.\n$$f_{1}^{\\text{total}} = \\frac{9.2}{17} - 0.6 = \\frac{9.2 - 0.6 \\times 17}{17} = \\frac{9.2 - 10.2}{17} = \\frac{-1.0}{17} \\text{ p.u.}$$\nTo express this flow in megawatts, we multiply by the base power $S_{\\mathrm{base}} = 100$ MW.\n$$P_{12}^{\\text{total}} = f_{1}^{\\text{total}} \\times S_{\\mathrm{base}} = \\left(-\\frac{1}{17}\\right) \\times 100 \\text{ MW} = -\\frac{100}{17} \\text{ MW}$$\nEvaluating this numerically:\n$$P_{12}^{\\text{total}} \\approx -5.8823529... \\text{ MW}$$\nThe problem asks for the result rounded to four significant figures.\n$$P_{12}^{\\text{total}} \\approx -5.882 \\text{ MW}$$\nThe sign convention states that positive flow on $\\ell_{1}$ is from bus $1$ to bus $2$. The negative sign indicates the net power flow is from bus $2$ to bus $1$.",

            "problem": "Consider a three-bus meshed network with buses labeled $1$, $2$, and $3$, where all lines are present: $(1,2)$, $(2,3)$, and $(1,3)$. The series reactances are $x_{12} = 0.2$ per unit, $x_{23} = 0.3$ per unit, and $x_{13} = 0.4$ per unit. Assume the direct-current (DC) power flow model: voltage magnitudes are $1$ per unit, angle differences are small, resistances and shunt admittances are negligible, and angles are measured in radians. Under this model, the branch flow on line $(i,j)$ is proportional to the difference of bus voltage phase angles, and nodal power injections equal the net sum of incident branch flows. Let the nodal susceptance of line $(i,j)$ be $b_{ij} = \\frac{1}{x_{ij}}$.\n\nStarting from these principles alone, derive the mapping from bus injections to branch flows via the nodal susceptance (Laplacian) matrix, and use it to construct a counterexample showing that Injection Shift Factor (ISF) values can differ significantly under different slack-bus choices, while the Power Transfer Distribution Factor (PTDF) for the same transaction $(s,t)$ is identical regardless of slack choice. Specifically, perform the following:\n\n1. Compute the branch flows resulting from a unit power injection at bus $1$ withdrawn at bus $3$ (this is the transaction $(1,3)$).

We will first validate the problem, then derive the necessary mathematical framework, and finally perform the specific calculations and provide the conceptual explanation as requested.\n\n### Problem Validation\nThe problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded in the standard DC power flow approximation used in power systems analysis. It is well-posed, providing all necessary reactances and a clear network topology. The definitions of PTDF and ISF are consistent with standard use in the field. The tasks are logically structured to lead to a specific conclusion about the properties of these factors. All data are consistent and the problem is free of ambiguity or contradiction.\n\n### DC Power Flow Formulation\nThe DC power flow model simplifies the power flow equations by making several assumptions: voltage magnitudes are unity, line resistances are negligible, and voltage angle differences across lines are small. Under these assumptions, the real power flow $P_{ij}$ from bus $i$ to bus $j$ is given by:\n$$ P_{ij} = \\frac{V_i V_j}{x_{ij}} \\sin(\\theta_i - \\theta_j) \\approx \\frac{1 \\cdot 1}{x_{ij}} (\\theta_i - \\theta_j) = b_{ij}(\\theta_i - \\theta_j) $$\nwhere $x_{ij}$ is the series reactance of the line $(i,j)$, $b_{ij} = 1/x_{ij}$ is the line susceptance, and $\\theta_i$ and $\\theta_j$ are the voltage phase angles at buses $i$ and $j$ in radians.\n\nThe net real power injection at bus $i$, denoted $P_i$, is the sum of all flows leaving the bus:\n$$ P_i = \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}_i} P_{ij} = \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}_i} b_{ij}(\\theta_i - \\theta_j) $$\nwhere $\\mathcal{N}_i$ is the set of buses connected to bus $i$. This can be written in matrix form as $P = B\\theta$, where $P$ is the vector of nodal power injections, $\\theta$ is the vector of bus voltage angles, and $B$ is the nodal susceptance matrix. The elements of $B$ are defined as:\n$$ B_{ii} = \\sum_{j \\neq i} b_{ij} $$\n$$ B_{ij} = -b_{ij} \\quad \\text{for } i \\neq j $$\nThe givens are the reactances: $x_{12} = 0.2$, $x_{23} = 0.3$, and $x_{13} = 0.4$. The corresponding susceptances are:\n$$ b_{12} = \\frac{1}{0.2} = 5 \\text{ p.u.} $$\n$$ b_{23} = \\frac{1}{0.3} = \\frac{10}{3} \\text{ p.u.} $$\n$$ b_{13} = \\frac{1}{0.4} = 2.5 \\text{ p.u.} $$\nThe nodal susceptance matrix $B$ is constructed as:\n$$ B_{11} = b_{12} + b_{13} = 5 + 2.5 = 7.5 $$\n$$ B_{22} = b_{21} + b_{23} = 5 + \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{25}{3} $$\n$$ B_{33} = b_{31} + b_{32} = 2.5 + \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{15}{6} + \\frac{20}{6} = \\frac{35}{6} $$\n$$ B_{12} = B_{21} = -b_{12} = -5 $$\n$$ B_{13} = B_{31} = -b_{13} = -2.5 $$\n$$ B_{23} = B_{32} = -b_{23} = -\\frac{10}{3} $$\nThus, the nodal susceptance matrix is:\n$$ B = \\begin{pmatrix} 7.5 & -5 & -2.5 \\\\ -5 & \\frac{25}{3} & -\\frac{10}{3} \\\\ -2.5 & -\\frac{10}{3} & \\frac{35}{6} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe sum of each row (and column) is zero, which means the matrix $B$ is singular. To solve the system $P = B\\theta$, we must choose a reference bus (slack bus) and set its angle to zero. This removes one equation and one variable, resulting in an invertible reduced system.\n\n### 1.

The injection vector is $P = \\begin{pmatrix} 1, & 0, & -1 \\end{pmatrix}^T$. To solve for the angles, we must select a slack bus. Let us choose bus $3$ as the slack bus, setting its angle $\\theta_3 = 0$. This removes the third row and column from the $B$ matrix and the third elements from the $P$ and $\\theta$ vectors. The reduced system is:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} P_1 \\\\ P_2 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} B_{11} & B_{12} \\\\ B_{21} & B_{22} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\theta_1 \\\\ \\theta_2 \\end{pmatrix} \\implies \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 7.5 & -5 \\\\ -5 & \\frac{25}{3} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\theta_1 \\\\ \\theta_2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nLet $B_{red}$ be the reduced $2 \\times 2$ matrix.

Its value is $4/9$.\n\n### 2. ISF Calculation for Injection at Bus 1\nAn ISF value is defined for an injection at a single bus, with the balancing withdrawal occurring at the designated slack bus. The problem specifies computing the flow on line $(1,2)$ resulting from a unit injection at bus $1$ withdrawn at bus $2$. This is equivalent to calculating $ISF_{12,1}$ with bus $2$ as the slack bus.\nThe injection vector is $P = \\begin{pmatrix} 1, & -1, & 0 \\end{pmatrix}^T$. We choose bus $2$ as slack, so $\\theta_2 = 0$. The reduced system involves buses $1$ and $3$:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} P_1 \\\\ P_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} B_{11} & B_{13} \\\\ B_{31} & B_{33} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\theta_1 \\\\ \\theta_3 \\end{pmatrix} \\implies \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 7.5 & -2.5 \\\\ -2.5 & \\frac{35}{6} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} \\theta_1 \\\\ \\theta_3 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nLet this new reduced matrix be $B'_{red}$. Its inverse is:\n$$ \\det(B'_{red}) = (7.5)\\left(\\frac{35}{6}\\right) - (-2.5)(-2.5) = \\left(\\frac{15}{2}\\right)\\left(\\frac{35}{6}\\right) - \\frac{25}{4} = \\frac{175}{4} - \\frac{25}{4} = \\frac{150}{4} = \\frac{75}{2} $$\n$$ (B'_{red})^{-1} = \\frac{2}{75} \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{35}{6} & 2.5 \\\\ 2.5 & 7.5 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{2}{75} \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{35}{6} & \\frac{5}{2} \\\\ \\frac{5}{2} & \\frac{15}{2} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{70}{450} & \\frac{10}{150} \\\\ \\frac{10}{150} & \\frac{30}{150} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{7}{45} & \\frac{1}{15} \\\\ \\frac{1}{15} & \\frac{1}{5} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe angles are found by:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} \\theta_1 \\\\ \\theta_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{7}{45} & \\frac{1}{15} \\\\ \\frac{1}{15} & \\frac{1}{5} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{7}{45} \\\\ \\frac{1}{15} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nSo, with bus $2$ as slack, the angles are $\\theta_1 = 7/45$ rad, $\\theta_2 = 0$ rad, and $\\theta_3 = 1/15$ rad.\nThe power flow on line $(1,2)$ is:\n$$ P_{12} = b_{12}(\\theta_1 - \\theta_2) = 5\\left(\\frac{7}{45} - 0\\right) = \\frac{35}{45} = \\frac{7}{9} $$\nThis value, $7/9$, is the ISF on line $(1,2)$ for an injection at bus $1$ when bus $2$ is the slack bus, i.e., $ISF_{12,1}^{slack=2}$.\n\n### 3. Comparison and Explanation\nThe results provide a clear counterexample:\n- $PTDF_{12,1-3} = 4/9$.\n- $ISF_{12,1}^{slack=2} = 7/9$.\nThese values are different. To further illustrate the dependency of ISF on the slack bus, consider the case where bus $3$ is the slack. The value $ISF_{12,1}^{slack=3}$ is the flow on line $(1,2)$ for an injection at bus $1$ withdrawn at bus $3$. This is precisely the experiment conducted in step 1. Thus, $ISF_{12,1}^{slack=3} = 4/9$.\nThe fact that $ISF_{12,1}^{slack=2} \\neq ISF_{12,1}^{slack=3}$ demonstrates that ISF values depend on the choice of slack bus.\n\nThe fundamental reason for this difference lies in the properties of the nodal susceptance matrix $B$ and the definitions of PTDF and ISF.\n\n**Independence of PTDF from Slack Choice:**\nThe system $P = B\\theta$ does not have a unique solution for $\\theta$ because $B$ is singular. If $\\theta^*$ is a solution for a given injection vector $P$, then $\\theta^* + c\\mathbf{1}$ is also a solution for any constant $c$, where $\\mathbf{1}$ is a vector of ones. This is because $B(\\theta^* + c\\mathbf{1}) = B\\theta^* + c(B\\mathbf{1}) = P + c \\cdot \\mathbf{0} = P$.\nChoosing a slack bus (e.g., setting $\\theta_k = 0$) fixes this constant $c$ and yields a unique angle vector. If we choose a different slack bus, say $m$, producing angle vector $\\theta'$, it must be that $\\theta'$ is just a constant shift of $\\theta$, i.e., $\\theta'_i = \\theta_i + c$ for all $i$.\nThe power flow on a line $(i,j)$ is $P_{ij} = b_{ij}(\\theta_i - \\theta_j)$. Under a change of slack bus, the new flow is $P'_{ij} = b_{ij}(\\theta'_i - \\theta'_j) = b_{ij}((\\theta_i + c) - (\\theta_j + c)) = b_{ij}(\\theta_i - \\theta_j) = P_{ij}$.\nTherefore, for a *fixed injection vector $P$*, the resulting branch flows are invariant to the choice of the slack bus.\nA PTDF is defined for a transaction between a specific source $s$ and sink $t$. This corresponds to a fixed injection vector where $P_s = 1$, $P_t = -1$, and $P_k = 0$ for $k \\notin \\{s,t\\}$. Since the injection vector is fixed by the definition of the PTDF, the resulting branch flows (and thus the PTDF values themselves) are independent of the choice of slack bus used for the calculation.\n\n**Dependence of ISF on Slack Choice:**\nAn ISF is defined relative to an injection at a single bus $s$. The model requires that total injections sum to zero, so this power must be withdrawn somewhere. By definition, this withdrawal is assumed to happen at the slack bus, $k_0$. Thus, calculating $ISF_{l,s}^{slack=k_0}$ for a line $l$ involves an injection vector where $P_s=1$, $P_{k_0}=-1$, and all other elements are zero.\nIf we change the slack bus to $k_1 \\neq k_0$, the physical experiment being modeled changes. The calculation for $ISF_{l,s}^{slack=k_1}$ now uses a different injection vector where $P_s=1$ and $P_{k_1}=-1$.\nSince the injection vector $P$ itself depends on the choice of slack bus, the resulting branch flows will generally be different. The ISF is not an intrinsic property of the network alone but is a function of the network *and* the choice of slack bus. Our calculation showing $ISF_{12,1}^{slack=2}=7/9$ and $ISF_{12,1}^{slack=3}=4/9$ confirms this principle.",

This final problem challenges you to analyze a meshed network where a power transfer induces a 'counterflow' on a line—a flow in the direction opposite to the main power path, resulting in a negative PTDF . By working through this example, you will develop a deeper physical intuition for loop flows and understand why analyzing the entire network, not just the direct path, is essential for accurate congestion management.",

The network has the following lines and series reactances: $(1,2)$ with $x_{12}=0.4$, $(2,3)$ with $x_{23}=0.6$, $(3,4)$ with $x_{34}=0.5$, $(4,1)$ with $x_{41}=0.3$, and the chord $(2,4)$ with $x_{24}=0.8$. Let the series susceptances be $b_{ij} = 1/x_{ij}$, and fix the reference angle at bus $1$ as $\\theta_1 = 0$. Adopt the line flow sign convention that $f_{ij} = b_{ij}(\\theta_i - \\theta_j)$ is positive in the direction $i \\to j$.\n\nThe base-case net injections are $p_2 = +1.0$, $p_4 = -1.0$, $p_3 = 0.0$, and $p_1 = 0.0$ (in per unit), so total net injection is zero.

Determine Incremental Angle Changes**\nThe incremental injections for a transfer from $s=1$ to $t=3$ are $\\Delta p_1 = +\\Delta P$ and $\\Delta p_3 = -\\Delta P$. The injection vector for the non-slack buses is $\\Delta p_{\\text{red}} = (\\Delta p_2, \\Delta p_3, \\Delta p_4)^T = (0, -\\Delta P, 0)^T$.\nWe solve $\\Delta \\theta_{\\text{red}} = (B_{\\text{bus,red}})^{-1} \\Delta p_{\\text{red}}$. Let $X_{\\text{red}} = (B_{\\text{bus,red}})^{-1}$.\nThen:\n$$ \\begin{pmatrix} \\Delta\\theta_2 \\\\ \\Delta\\theta_3 \\\\ \\Delta\\theta_4 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} X_{22} & X_{23} & X_{24} \\\\ X_{32} & X_{33} & X_{34} \\\\ X_{42} & X_{43} & X_{44} \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ -\\Delta P \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis gives $\\Delta\\theta_2 = -X_{23} \\Delta P$, $\\Delta\\theta_3 = -X_{33} \\Delta P$, and $\\Delta\\theta_4 = -X_{43} \\Delta P$.\nThe slack bus angle does not change, $\\Delta\\theta_1 = 0$.\n\n**4. Calculate the PTDF**\nWe need the PTDF for line $2 \\to 4$ with respect to transfer $1 \\to 3$:\n$$ \\text{PTDF}_{24,13} = \\frac{\\Delta f_{24}}{\\Delta P} = \\frac{b_{24}(\\Delta\\theta_2 - \\Delta\\theta_4)}{\\Delta P} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\Delta\\theta_2$ and $\\Delta\\theta_4$:\n$$ \\text{PTDF}_{24,13} = b_{24} \\frac{(-X_{23} \\Delta P) - (-X_{43} \\Delta P)}{\\Delta P} = b_{24}(X_{43} - X_{23}) $$\nWe need to compute the elements $X_{23}$ and $X_{43}$ of the inverse matrix $X_{\\text{red}}$. These are the elements in the second column (corresponding to bus $3$) and the first and third rows (corresponding to buses $2$ and $4$).\n\nThe determinant of $B_{\\text{bus,red}}$ is $\\det(B_{\\text{bus,red}}) = \\frac{5525}{72}$.\nThe required elements of the inverse are found from the adjugate matrix:\n$X_{23} = \\frac{C_{32}}{\\det(B_{\\text{bus,red}})}$ where $C_{32}$ is the cofactor of element $(3,2)$ in $B_{\\text{bus,red}}$.\n$C_{32} = (-1)^{3+2} \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 65/12 & -5/4 \\\\ -5/3 & -2 \\end{pmatrix} = -1 \\left( (65/12)(-2) - (-5/4)(-5/3) \\right) = - \\left( -130/12 - 25/12 \\right) = 155/12$.\n$X_{43} = \\frac{C_{34}}{\\det(B_{\\text{bus,red}})}$ does not give $X_{43}$. This is confusing notation. Let us use matrix indices.\n$X_{ij} = (\\text{Cofactor}_{ji})/\\det$. We need $X_{\\text{row2, col3}}$ and $X_{\\text{row4, col3}}$.\nLet's use $(i,j)$ for matrix indices $1,2,3$ mapping to buses $2,3,4$. We need $X_{12}$ and $X_{32}$.\n$X_{12} = \\frac{C_{21}}{\\det} = \\frac{(-1)^{2+1} \\det \\begin{pmatrix} -5/3 & -5/4 \\\\ -2 & 79/12 \\end{pmatrix}}{\\det} = \\frac{-[(-5/3)(79/12) - (-5/4)(-2)]}{5525/72} = \\frac{-[-395/36 - 90/36]}{5525/72} = \\frac{485/36}{5525/72} = \\frac{485 \\cdot 2}{5525} = \\frac{970}{5525} = \\frac{194}{1105}$.\n$X_{32} = \\frac{C_{23}}{\\det} = \\frac{(-1)^{2+3} \\det \\begin{pmatrix} 65/12 & -5/3 \\\\ -5/4 & -2 \\end{pmatrix}}{\\det} = \\frac{-[(65/12)(-2) - (-5/3)(-5/4)]}{5525/72} = \\frac{-[-130/12 - 25/12]}{5525/72} = \\frac{155/12}{5525/72} = \\frac{155 \\cdot 6}{5525} = \\frac{930}{5525} = \\frac{186}{1105}$.\n\nSo, mapping back to bus indices, $X_{23} = 194/1105$ and $X_{43} = 186/1105$.\nNow, we calculate the PTDF:\n$$ \\text{PTDF}_{24,13} = b_{24}(X_{43} - X_{23}) = 1.25 \\left( \\frac{186}{1105} - \\frac{194}{1105} \\right) = \\frac{5}{4} \\left( \\frac{-8}{1105} \\right) = \\frac{-10}{1105} = \\frac{-2}{221} $$\nNumerically, this is $\\text{PTDF}_{24,13} \\approx -0.0090497...$\n\n**Physical Explanation**\nThe transfer of power from bus $1$ to bus $3$ creates flows along two primary parallel paths: Path A ($1 \\to 2 \\to 3$) and Path B ($1 \\to 4 \\to 3$). The total series reactances are $x_A = x_{12} + x_{23} = 0.4 + 0.6 = 1.0$ and $x_B = x_{41} + x_{34} = 0.3 + 0.5 = 0.8$. Since Path B has lower reactance, it will carry a larger portion of the transferred power.\nThe line $2 \\to 4$ forms a chord between these paths, effectively creating a Wheatstone bridge configuration. A flow will be induced on this chord unless the bridge is balanced, which would require the reactance ratios to be equal: $x_{12}/x_{23} = x_{41}/x_{34}$. Here, we have $0.4/0.6 = 2/3 \\approx 0.667$ and $0.3/0.5 = 3/5 = 0.6$. The ratios are not equal, so a flow on line $2 \\to 4$ is expected.\nTo find the direction of this flow, we compare the incremental angle drops from bus $1$ to bus $2$ and from bus $1$ to bus $4$.\nIgnoring the effect of the connecting chord for a first-order approximation, the angle at bus $2$ is $\\Delta\\theta_2 \\approx -x_{12}\\Delta f_{12}$ and at bus $4$ is $\\Delta\\theta_4 \\approx -x_{14}\\Delta f_{14}$, where $\\Delta f_{12}$ and $\\Delta f_{14}$ are the fractions of the total transfer $\\Delta P$ flowing along the respective paths.\nThe flow splits inversely to the path reactances: $\\Delta f_{12} / \\Delta f_{14} \\approx x_B / x_A = 0.8/1.0 = 0.8$.\nThe angle drop along line $1 \\to 2$ is proportional to $x_{12} \\times (\\text{flow on path A}) \\propto 0.4 \\times (0.8 \\text{ unit}) = 0.32$.\nThe angle drop along line $1 \\to 4$ is proportional to $x_{14} \\times (\\text{flow on path B}) \\propto 0.3 \\times (1.0 \\text{ unit}) = 0.30$.\n(Here the flow units are relative, based on the ratio).\nThis approximation suggests the \"voltage drop\" from $1$ to $2$ is slightly larger than from $1$ to $4$: $\\Delta\\theta_1 - \\Delta\\theta_2 > \\Delta\\theta_1 - \\Delta\\theta_4$. With $\\Delta\\theta_1=0$, this means $-\\Delta\\theta_2 > -\\Delta\\theta_4$, which implies $\\Delta\\theta_2 < \\Delta\\theta_4$.\nSince $\\Delta\\theta_2 < \\Delta\\theta_4$, a flow is induced from the bus with the higher angle (bus $4$) to the bus with the lower angle (bus $2$). This flow, $f_{4 \\to 2}$, is a \"balancing\" or \"loop\" flow.\nThe question asks for the PTDF for the flow $2 \\to 4$. Since the flow is physically from $4 \\to 2$, the value of $\\Delta f_{24} = b_{24}(\\Delta\\theta_2 - \\Delta\\theta_4)$ will be negative. Therefore, the PTDF is negative. This confirms the result of the matrix calculation.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The PTDF for $2 \\to 4$ with respect to $1 \\to 3$ is positive (approximately $+0.35$), because the transfer reinforces the base-case flow on $2 \\to 4$ along the shortest electrical path.**\n-   The sign is negative, not positive. The magnitude is approximately $-0.009$, not $+0.35$. The calculation is incorrect. The reasoning is flawed; the flow on line $2 \\to 4$ is a loop flow, not a direct path flow for the $1 \\to 3$ transfer. The PTDF is an incremental quantity and does not depend on the base-case flow.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. The PTDF for $2 \\to 4$ with respect to $1 \\to 3$ is negative (approximately $-0.009$), because the mesh causes angle adjustments that send a small balancing backflow across $2 \\to 4$ to redistribute loop flows between the parallel paths $1\\!-\\!2\\!-\\!3$ and $1\\!-\\!4\\!-\\!3$.**\n-   The calculated PTDF is $-2/221 \\approx -0.009$. The value and sign are correct. The physical explanation is also correct: the transfer creates a potential difference across the chord $2 \\to 4$ due to unequal \"voltage division\" along the parallel paths, inducing a small balancing flow (a backflow or counterflow relative to the overall power movement direction) to satisfy Kirchhoff's laws in the mesh.\n-   Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. The PTDF for $2 \\to 4$ with respect to $1 \\to 3$ is exactly zero, because line $2 \\to 4$ is not on a simple path between buses $1$ and $3$.**\n-   The calculation proves the PTDF is non-zero. The reasoning is incorrect. In a meshed network, a transfer between any two nodes will generally induce a change in flow on all lines. A zero PTDF would only occur under specific balancing conditions (like in a balanced Wheatstone bridge) or if the line were on a disconnected part of the network, neither of which is the case here.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The PTDF sign depends on the choice of slack bus; with bus $1$ as slack it is positive, but with bus $2$ as slack it would be negative.**\n-   This statement is fundamentally incorrect. PTDFs represent the physical division of power flow and are independent of the choice of the mathematical reference (the slack bus). While the absolute angles of all buses change with the reference, the angle differences, and thus the power flows, remain the same for a given set of injections.\n-   Verdict: **Incorrect**.",
