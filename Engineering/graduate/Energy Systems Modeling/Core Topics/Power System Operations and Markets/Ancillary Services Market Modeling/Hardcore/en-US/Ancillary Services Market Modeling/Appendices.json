            "problem": "A transmission system operator intends to design an ancillary services product for rotational inertia to enforce a rate-of-change-of-frequency (RoCoF) limit following a credible contingency. Consider the system represented by a single center-of-inertia machine. The aggregated swing dynamics for the center-of-inertia frequency are described by the classical swing equation, and the inertia constant is defined in the standard way: the kinetic energy stored in rotating masses at rated speed is $E_{k} = H_{\\mathrm{sys}} S_{\\mathrm{base}}$, where $H_{\\mathrm{sys}}$ is the aggregated inertia constant (in seconds) on the system power base $S_{\\mathrm{base}}$ (in megavolt-amperes), and $E_{k}$ is in megajoules. Assume that load damping and primary control are negligible in the initial moments after a disturbance so that the initial rate-of-change-of-frequency is governed solely by the power imbalance and inertia.\n\nThe nominal frequency is $f_{0} = 50$ Hz.

            "solution": "The user wants me to validate and solve a problem from the field of energy systems modeling, specifically concerning the ancillary services market for rotational inertia.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- **System model**: Single center-of-inertia machine.\n- **System dynamics**: Classical swing equation.\n- **Inertia constant definition**: $E_{k} = H_{\\mathrm{sys}} S_{\\mathrm{base}}$, where $E_{k}$ is kinetic energy in megajoules ($MJ$), $H_{\\mathrm{sys}}$ is the aggregated inertia constant in seconds ($s$), and $S_{\\mathrm{base}}$ is the system power base in megavolt-amperes ($MVA$).\n- **Assumption**: Load damping and primary control are negligible in the initial moments after a disturbance.\n- **Nominal frequency**: $f_{0} = 50$ Hz.\n- **System power base**: $S_{\\mathrm{base}} = 31$ GW.\n- **Credible contingency**: Sudden loss of generation $\\Delta P = 1.30$ GW.\n- **RoCoF limit**: $|\\mathrm{d}f/\\mathrm{d}t| \\le \\alpha$, with $\\alpha = 0.40$ Hz/s.\n- **Task**: Derive the condition linking the RoCoF limit to the minimum aggregated inertia constant $H_{\\mathrm{sys}}$ and then compute this minimum $H_{\\mathrm{sys}}$.\n- **Output format**: Round the final answer to four significant figures.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\n1.  **Scientific Groundedness**: The problem is based on the classical swing equation for a center-of-inertia, which is a fundamental and standard model for analyzing the initial frequency dynamics of a power system following a disturbance. The concept of an inertia constant $H_{\\mathrm{sys}}$ and a Rate-of-Change-of-Frequency (RoCoF) limit are core principles in modern power system stability and operation. The scenario of procuring inertia to manage RoCoF is a realistic and critical issue in contemporary energy systems, especially with increasing penetration of non-synchronous renewable energy sources. The problem is scientifically sound.\n\n2.  **Well-Posedness**: The problem provides all necessary data to establish a mathematical relationship and solve for the unknown variable ($H_{\\mathrm{sys}}$). The objective is clearly defined, and a unique minimum value for $H_{\\mathrm{sys}}$ that satisfies the given constraint is expected to exist.\n\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and unbiased language.\n\n4.  **Consistency Check**: The problem defines $S_{\\mathrm{base}}$ in MVA in the formal definition of $H_{\\mathrm{sys}}$ but gives its value in GW. In power system analysis, the power base is often stated in MW or GW, implicitly assuming a power factor of unity, making the numerical values of active power (MW) and apparent power (MVA) equivalent. Given that the disturbance $\\Delta P$ is also in GW (active power), it is consistent to treat $S_{\\mathrm{base}}$ as a $31$ GW (or $31000$ MW) base. This is a common convention and does not constitute a contradiction. The problem is internally consistent and complete.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe swing equation for a synchronous machine, or an aggregated system represented by a center of inertia, relates the change in rotor speed to the imbalance between mechanical power input and electrical power output. In the per-unit (p.u.) system, this equation is:\n$$ 2 H_{\\mathrm{sys}} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\omega_{\\mathrm{p.u.}}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = P_{m, \\mathrm{p.u.}} - P_{e, \\mathrm{p.u.}} = \\Delta P_{\\text{p.u.}} $$\nHere, $H_{\\mathrm{sys}}$ is the aggregated system inertia constant in seconds, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{p.u.}}$ is the system frequency in p.u., $t$ is time in seconds, and $\\Delta P_{\\text{p.u.}}$ is the net power imbalance in p.u. on the system power base $S_{\\mathrm{base}}$.\n\nThe system frequency in Hertz, $f$, is related to the per-unit frequency $\\omega_{\\mathrm{p.u.}}$ by the nominal frequency $f_{0}$:\n$$ f = f_{0} \\omega_{\\mathrm{p.u.}} $$\nDifferentiating this expression with respect to time gives the relationship between the Rate-of-Change-of-Frequency (RoCoF) in Hz/s and the rate of change of the per-unit frequency:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}t} = f_{0} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\omega_{\\mathrm{p.u.}}}{\\mathrm{d}t} $$\nWe can rearrange this to express the derivative of the per-unit frequency:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\omega_{\\mathrm{p.u.}}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{1}{f_{0}} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}t} $$\nSubstituting this into the per-unit swing equation yields:\n$$ 2 H_{\\mathrm{sys}} \\left( \\frac{1}{f_{0}} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\right) = \\Delta P_{\\text{p.u.}} $$\nThe problem describes a credible contingency as a sudden loss of generation of magnitude $\\Delta P$. This event creates an immediate power imbalance where the electrical load exceeds the mechanical power generation. The power imbalance is $\\Delta P_{\\text{imbalance}} = P_m - P_e = -\\Delta P$.\nIn per-unit terms, this imbalance is calculated with respect to the system base power $S_{\\mathrm{base}}$:\n$$ \\Delta P_{\\text{p.u.}} = \\frac{-\\Delta P}{S_{\\mathrm{base}}} $$\nThe problem states that load damping and primary frequency control are negligible in the initial moments. Therefore, the initial RoCoF is determined exclusively by this power imbalance and the system's stored kinetic energy (inertia). Substituting the expression for $\\Delta P_{\\text{p.u.}}$ into our modified swing equation gives:\n$$ 2 H_{\\mathrm{sys}} \\left( \\frac{1}{f_{0}} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\right) = -\\frac{\\Delta P}{S_{\\mathrm{base}}} $$\nSolving for the RoCoF ($\\mathrm{d}f/\\mathrm{d}t$):\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\frac{f_{0}}{2 H_{\\mathrm{sys}}} \\frac{\\Delta P}{S_{\\mathrm{base}}} $$\nThe negative sign correctly indicates that a loss of generation causes the frequency to decline.\n\nThe system must be operated such that the magnitude of the RoCoF does not exceed a specified limit $\\alpha$. This imposes the following constraint:\n$$ \\left| \\frac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\right| \\le \\alpha $$\nSubstituting our expression for the RoCoF:\n$$ \\left| -\\frac{f_{0}}{2 H_{\\mathrm{sys}}} \\frac{\\Delta P}{S_{\\mathrm{base}}} \\right| \\le \\alpha $$\n$$ \\frac{f_{0}}{2 H_{\\mathrm{sys}}} \\frac{\\Delta P}{S_{\\mathrm{base}}} \\le \\alpha $$\nThis inequality is the condition linking the RoCoF limit to the system inertia. To satisfy this condition, $H_{\\mathrm{sys}}$ must be greater than or equal to a certain minimum value. The minimum required inertia, $H_{\\mathrm{sys, min}}$, is found when the equality holds:\n$$ \\frac{f_{0}}{2 H_{\\mathrm{sys, min}}} \\frac{\\Delta P}{S_{\\mathrm{base}}} = \\alpha $$\nSolving for $H_{\\mathrm{sys, min}}$ gives the final derived formula:\n$$ H_{\\mathrm{sys, min}} = \\frac{f_{0}}{2 \\alpha} \\frac{\\Delta P}{S_{\\mathrm{base}}} $$\nWe are given the following values:\n- $f_{0} = 50$ Hz\n- $\\alpha = 0.40$ Hz/s\n- $\\Delta P = 1.30$ GW\n- $S_{\\mathrm{base}} = 31$ GW\n\nThe power imbalance in per unit is a dimensionless quantity:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta P}{S_{\\mathrm{base}}} = \\frac{1.30 \\text{ GW}}{31 \\text{ GW}} = \\frac{1.30}{31} $$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values into the equation for $H_{\\mathrm{sys, min}}$:\n$$ H_{\\mathrm{sys, min}} = \\frac{50}{2 \\times 0.40} \\left( \\frac{1.30}{31} \\right) $$\n$$ H_{\\mathrm{sys, min}} = \\frac{50}{0.80} \\left( \\frac{1.30}{31} \\right) $$\n$$ H_{\\mathrm{sys, min}} = 62.5 \\left( \\frac{1.30}{31} \\right) $$\n$$ H_{\\mathrm{sys, min}} = \\frac{81.25}{31} $$\n$$ H_{\\mathrm{sys, min}} \\approx 2.62096774... \\text{ s} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ H_{\\mathrm{sys, min}} \\approx 2.621 \\text{ s} $$",

There is no line directly connecting bus $2$ and bus $3$. The line between bus $1$ and bus $2$ has series reactance $x_{21} = 0.1$ (in per-unit on a consistent base) and a thermal flow limit $F_{21}^{\\max} = 100$ MW. The line between bus $1$ and bus $3$ has series reactance $x_{31} = 0.1$ and a thermal flow limit $F_{31}^{\\max} = 70$ MW.

The system operator sets a system-wide spinning reserve requirement equal to the largest single generating contingency.

It describes a standard scenario in power system security analysis using the Direct-Current (DC) power flow approximation, a fundamental and widely-used model in the field. All parameters and conditions are provided, allowing for a unique and meaningful solution. We may therefore proceed with the calculation.\n\nThe objective is to calculate the post-contingency overload on the transmission line connecting bus $1$ and bus $3$. The overload is defined as the difference between the magnitude of the post-contingency power flow, which we will denote as $|f_{31}'|$, and the line's thermal limit, $F_{31}^{\\max}$.\n\nFirst, we must establish the post-contingency state of the system's power injections. The contingency is the outage of the generator at bus $2$, which was producing $100$ MW. The spinning reserve of $100$ MW, procured at bus $3$, is deployed to compensate for this loss and rebalance the system. The load at bus $1$ remains unchanged.\n\nThe post-contingency power injections, denoted with a prime ($'$), are:\n-   Load at bus $1$: $p_1' = -100$ MW.\n-   Generation at bus $2$: $p_2' = 0$ MW (due to the outage).\n-   Generation at bus $3$: $p_3' = 100$ MW (due to reserve deployment).\n\nThe total net injection is $p_1' + p_2' + p_3' = -100 + 0 + 100 = 0$ MW, confirming that power is balanced in the lossless DC model.\n\nNext, we apply the DC power flow equations to determine the post-contingency voltage angles, $\\theta_i'$. Bus $1$ is defined as the reference bus, so its voltage angle is zero, both pre- and post-contingency: $\\theta_1' = 0$ radians.\n\nThe nodal power balance equation at any bus $i$ is given by $p_i = \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}(i)} \\frac{1}{x_{ij}}(\\theta_i - \\theta_j)$.

The magnitude of the flow is $|f_{31}'| = 100$ MW.\n\nFinally, we compute the overload. The thermal limit of the line is given as $F_{31}^{\\max} = 70$ MW.
