This exercise  guides you through a formal derivation of this principle from the foundational Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a DC Optimal Power Flow (DCOPF) problem, solidifying your understanding of why a single system-wide price, or market-clearing price, emerges in an uncongested network.",

            "solution": "The analysis proceeds in two parts as requested. First, we derive the general conditions for uniform Locational Marginal Prices (LMPs) from first principles. Second, we apply this understanding to solve the specific numerical example.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Condition for Uniform LMPs\n\nThe Direct-Current Optimal Power Flow (DCOPF) problem aims to minimize the total cost of generation subject to physical and operational constraints. As per the problem statement, we consider a lossless and uncongested network.\n\nThe decision variables are the vector of generation injections, $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, and the vector of bus voltage phase angles, $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. The objective is to minimize the total generation cost, which is the sum of individual generator cost functions:\n$$\n\\min_{p, \\theta} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} C_{i}(p_{i})\n$$\nThis minimization is subject to several constraints:\n\n1.  **Nodal Power Balance:** At each bus $i$, the power injected must equal the power withdrawn. The problem provides this as $d - p - K^{\\top} f = 0$. Substituting the line flow equation $f = B_{\\ell} K \\theta$, we get:\n    $$\n    d - p - K^{\\top} B_{\\ell} K \\theta = 0\n    $$\n    Let's define the bus admittance matrix $B_{bus} = K^{\\top} B_{\\ell} K$. The nodal power balance constraint for each bus $i$ is then:\n    $$\n    p_i - d_i + (B_{bus}\\theta)_i = 0 \\quad \\text{for } i \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}\n    $$\n    We associate a Lagrange multiplier, $\\lambda_i$, with each of these $n$ equality constraints. The vector of these multipliers, $\\lambda = [\\lambda_1, \\dots, \\lambda_n]^{\\top}$, represents the Locational Marginal Prices.\n\n2.  **Generation Capacity Limits:** Each generator has a finite capacity:\n    $$\n    0 \\le p_i \\le \\overline{p}_{i}\n    $$\n    We associate Lagrange multipliers $\\mu_i^{min} \\ge 0$ with the constraint $p_i \\ge 0$ (or $-p_i \\le 0$) and $\\mu_i^{max} \\ge 0$ with the constraint $p_i \\le \\overline{p}_{i}$.\n\n3.  **Phase Angle Reference:** To ensure a unique solution for the phase angles, one bus is chosen as the reference (or slack) bus, and its angle is set to zero. Let bus $k_{ref}$ be the reference bus:\n    $$\n    \\theta_{k_{ref}} = 0\n    $$\n\nThe problem is a convex optimization problem, so we can analyze its Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions to find the properties of the optimal solution. The Lagrangian function $\\mathcal{L}$ is:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(p, \\theta, \\lambda, \\mu^{min}, \\mu^{max}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} C_{i}(p_{i}) - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\lambda_{i} \\left( p_{i} - d_{i} + (B_{bus}\\theta)_i \\right) - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\mu_{i}^{min} p_{i} + \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\mu_{i}^{max} (p_{i} - \\overline{p}_{i})\n$$\nThe first-order KKT stationarity conditions require the gradient of the Lagrangian with respect to the primal variables ($p_i$ and $\\theta_i$) to be zero.\n\n**Stationarity with respect to generation $p_i$:**\nFor each generator $i$ with a non-zero cost function:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial p_{i}} = \\frac{dC_{i}}{dp_{i}} - \\lambda_{i} - \\mu_{i}^{min} + \\mu_{i}^{max} = 0\n$$\nThis yields the fundamental relationship for the LMP at bus $i$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{i} = \\frac{dC_{i}}{dp_{i}} - \\mu_{i}^{min} + \\mu_{i}^{max}\n$$\nThis equation shows that the LMP at a bus equals the marginal cost of the generator at that bus, adjusted by the shadow prices of its capacity limits. If the generator is operating strictly between its limits ($0 < p_i < \\overline{p}_{i}$), then by complementary slackness, $\\mu_{i}^{min} = 0$ and $\\mu_{i}^{max} = 0$, so $\\lambda_{i} = \\frac{dC_{i}}{dp_{i}}$.\n\n**Stationarity with respect to phase angle $\\theta_k$:**\nFor each bus $k$ that is not the reference bus ($k \\ne k_{ref}$), we have:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\theta_{k}} = - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\lambda_{i} \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_{k}} (B_{bus}\\theta)_i = 0\n$$\nThe term $(B_{bus}\\theta)_i$ is $\\sum_{j=1}^{n} (B_{bus})_{ij} \\theta_j$. Therefore, its partial derivative with respect to $\\theta_k$ is $(B_{bus})_{ik}$. The stationarity condition becomes:\n$$\n- \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\lambda_{i} (B_{bus})_{ik} = 0 \\quad \\text{for all } k \\ne k_{ref}\n$$\nIn matrix form, this is the $k$-th component of the vector product $-B_{bus}^{\\top} \\lambda$. Since $B_{bus}$ is symmetric ($B_{bus}^{\\top} = B_{bus}$), this is equivalent to $(B_{bus}\\lambda)_k = 0$ for all non-reference buses.\n\nFor the reference bus $k_{ref}$, the sum of all rows of $B_{bus}$ is zero (i.e., $\\sum_i (B_{bus})_{ik} = 0$), which means that if $(B_{bus}\\lambda)_k = 0$ holds for all $k \\ne k_{ref}$, it automatically holds for $k=k_{ref}$ as well. Therefore, the condition holds for all buses:\n$$\nB_{bus} \\lambda = 0\n$$\nThe bus admittance matrix $B_{bus}$ for a connected network is a graph Laplacian. Its null space is one-dimensional and is spanned by the vector of all ones, $\\mathbf{1} = [1, 1, \\dots, 1]^{\\top}$. The condition $B_{bus} \\lambda = 0$ thus implies that the vector $\\lambda$ must be an element of this null space. Consequently, $\\lambda$ must be a scalar multiple of the vector $\\mathbf{1}$:\n$$\n\\lambda = c \\cdot \\mathbf{1}\n$$\nfor some scalar $c$. This is equivalent to stating that all components of the vector $\\lambda$ are identical:\n$$\n\\lambda_1 = \\lambda_2 = \\dots = \\lambda_n = c\n$$\nThis completes the derivation. The crucial step relies on the stationarity condition with respect to the phase angles. This condition takes the form $B_{bus}\\lambda=0$ precisely because we have assumed an uncongested network. If any transmission line were at its limit, additional terms involving the Lagrange multipliers of the line flow constraints would appear in the stationarity equation for $\\theta$, breaking the simple $B_{bus}\\lambda=0$ relationship and leading to different LMPs across the network.\n\nTherefore, the condition under which LMPs are identical across all buses in a connected network is the absence of binding transmission constraints (i.e., no congestion).\n\n### Part 2: Numerical Example\n\nThe problem describes a $3$-bus system with no transmission congestion. Based on the derivation in Part 1, we expect a single, uniform LMP, which we will denote by $\\lambda$. The network topology and line susceptances are not needed to find the optimal generation dispatch and the system-wide LMP in an uncongested case; the network's role is simply to connect the buses into a single price region.\n\nThe problem is to minimize the total cost:\n$$\nC(p_1, p_3) = C_{1}(p_{1}) + C_{3}(p_{3}) = \\left(15p_{1} + 0.1p_{1}^{2}\\right) + \\left(10p_{3} + 0.05p_{3}^{2}\\right)\n$$\nsubject to meeting the total demand. The total demand is $D_{total} = d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = 0 + 100 + 0 = 100$. With zero losses, the total generation must equal the total demand:\n$$\np_1 + p_3 = 100\n$$\nThe generation limits are $0 \\le p_1 \\le 120$ and $0 \\le p_3 \\le 120$.\n\nIn an optimal, uncongested dispatch, the marginal costs of all online generators are equal to the system LMP, provided they are operating within their capacity limits. Let's compute the marginal cost functions:\n$$\n\\frac{dC_1}{dp_1} = 15 + 0.2p_1\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dC_3}{dp_3} = 10 + 0.1p_3\n$$\nWe set the marginal costs equal to the uniform LMP $\\lambda$:\n$$\n15 + 0.2p_1 = \\lambda \\quad (1)\n$$\n$$\n10 + 0.1p_3 = \\lambda \\quad (2)\n$$\nWe can express $p_1$ and $p_3$ in terms of $\\lambda$:\n$$\np_1 = \\frac{\\lambda - 15}{0.2} = 5(\\lambda - 15)\n$$\n$$\np_3 = \\frac{\\lambda - 10}{0.1} = 10(\\lambda - 10)\n$$\nNow, we use the power balance equation $p_1 + p_3 = 100$:\n$$\n5(\\lambda - 15) + 10(\\lambda - 10) = 100\n$$\n$$\n5\\lambda - 75 + 10\\lambda - 100 = 100\n$$\n$$\n15\\lambda - 175 = 100\n$$\n$$\n15\\lambda = 275\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{275}{15} = \\frac{55}{3}\n$$\nThe uniform LMP is $\\lambda = \\frac{55}{3} \\approx 18.333\\dots$ $\\$ /\\text{MWh}$.\n\nWe can now find the optimal dispatch $(p_1^\\star, p_3^\\star)$:\n$$\np_1^\\star = 5\\left(\\frac{55}{3} - 15\\right) = 5\\left(\\frac{55 - 45}{3}\\right) = 5\\left(\\frac{10}{3}\\right) = \\frac{50}{3}\n$$\n$$\np_3^\\star = 10\\left(\\frac{55}{3} - 10\\right) = 10\\left(\\frac{55 - 30}{3}\\right) = 10\\left(\\frac{25}{3}\\right) = \\frac{250}{3}\n$$\nThe optimal dispatch is $p_1^\\star \\approx 16.67$ MW and $p_3^\\star \\approx 83.33$ MW.\nWe check if these values are within the generator capacity limits:\n$0 < \\frac{50}{3} < 120$ and $0 < \\frac{250}{3} < 120$. Both conditions are satisfied. Thus, our assumption that the generators are not at their limits is correct, and the marginal costs are indeed equal.\n\nThe final step is to round the value of the LMP to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{55}{3} \\approx 18.3333\\dots\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures gives $18.33$.\nThe uniform LMP is $18.33$ $\\$/\\text{MWh}$.",

We begin by formulating the Security-Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED) problem.\n\n### Mathematical Formulation\nThe objective is to minimize the total system cost, where the wind subsidy is treated as a negative cost.\n\n**Decision Variables:**\n*   $g_w$: Wind generation at Bus 1 (MW)\n*   $g_t$: Thermal generation at Bus 2 (MW)\n*   $f$: Power flow from Bus 1 to Bus 2 (MW)\n\n**Objective Function:**\n$$ \\min_{g_w, g_t, f} \\quad c_t g_t - s g_w $$\nSubstituting the given values ($c_t=30, s=50$), we have:\n$$ \\min_{g_w, g_t, f} \\quad 30 g_t - 50 g_w $$\n\n**Constraints:**\n1.  **Bus Power Balance:**\n    *   Bus 1: $g_w - f - d_1 = 0 \\implies g_w - f = 0 \\quad (\\lambda_1)$\n    *   Bus 2: $g_t + f - d_2 = 0 \\implies g_t + f = 100 \\quad (\\lambda_2)$\n    The dual variables $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$ are the LMPs at Bus 1 and Bus 2, respectively.\n2.  **Generator Capability Limits:**\n    *   Wind: $0 \\le g_w \\le G_{\\max} \\implies 0 \\le g_w \\le 120$\n    *   Thermal: $g_t \\ge 0$\n3.  **Transmission Line Limit:**\n    *   $-F_{\\max} \\le f \\le F_{\\max} \\implies -60 \\le f \\le 60$\n\n### Optimal Dispatch and LMP Calculation\nFirst, we determine the optimal dispatch by comparing the marginal costs. The effective marginal cost of wind is $-50 \\$/MWh$, while the thermal generator's cost is $30 \\$/MWh$. The system will prioritize using the wind generation. The entire system load of $100$ MW is at Bus 2. To serve this load, power must flow from Bus 1 to Bus 2. However, the transmission line capacity is limited to $F_{\\max} = 60$ MW.\n\nTherefore, the system will dispatch the maximum possible amount of wind power that can be transmitted. The flow will be maximized:\n$f^* = 60$ MW.\n\nThis means the line is congested. We can determine the generation dispatch using the power balance equations:\n*   From Bus 1 balance: $g_w^* = f^* = 60$ MW. This is within the wind availability limit of $120$ MW, so the wind generator is being curtailed.\n*   From Bus 2 balance: $g_t^* = 100 - f^* = 100 - 60 = 40$ MW.\n\nThis dispatch is feasible. The LMPs are determined by the marginal cost of serving an additional increment of load at each bus.\n\n*   **LMP at Bus 2 ($\\lambda_2$):** Since the transmission line from Bus 1 is at its limit, any additional load at Bus 2 must be served by the local thermal generator. Therefore, the LMP at Bus 2 is equal to the marginal cost of the thermal generator.\n    $$ \\lambda_2 = c_t = 30 \\$/\\text{MWh} $$\n\n*   **LMP at Bus 1 ($\\lambda_1$):** To serve an additional increment of load at Bus 1, the system would simply increase the output of the wind generator, reducing its curtailment.
