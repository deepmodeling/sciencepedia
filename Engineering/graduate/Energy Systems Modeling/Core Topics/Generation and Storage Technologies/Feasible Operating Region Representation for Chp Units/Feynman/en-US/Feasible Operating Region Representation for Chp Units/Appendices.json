            "problem": "A Combined Heat and Power (CHP) unit operating in back-pressure mode is characterized by a fixed ratio of thermal to electric outputs, denoted by the heat-to-power ratio $\\rho$. In energy systems modeling, the feasible operating region in the electric-thermal plane is constructed from core physical principles: mass and energy conservation across the turbine and heat-recovery subsystems imply proportionality between electric power $P$ and useful heat $H$ for back-pressure operation. The unit is also subject to minimum and maximum electric power limits $P^{\\min}$ and $P^{\\max}$, and modelers sometimes allow an absolute tolerance $\\epsilon$ on the heat-power proportionality to capture measurement and modeling uncertainties in the aggregate representation of the plant. Consider a back-pressure unit with $\\rho=1.8$, $P^{\\min}=20$, and $P^{\\max}=100$ (all powers in megawatts electric (MW$_{\\mathrm{e}}$) for electric power and megawatts thermal (MW$_{\\mathrm{th}}$) for heat, respectively). For a scheduled electric loading of $P=65$ (MW$_{\\mathrm{e}}$), include a tolerance band $\\epsilon=3$ (MW$_{\\mathrm{th}}$) on the proportionality. Using fundamental CHP energy-coupling reasoning, derive the feasible thermal output interval at this operating point and compute its lower and upper bounds. Express your final bounds in megawatts thermal (MW$_{\\mathrm{th}}$). Report your answer as the ordered pair $(H^{\\min}_{\\text{feas}}, H^{\\max}_{\\text{feas}})$.",
            "solution": "The problem statement is first validated for scientific soundness, self-consistency, and clarity before a solution is attempted.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n-   The Combined Heat and Power (CHP) unit operates in back-pressure mode.\n-   The fixed ratio of thermal to electric output is the heat-to-power ratio, $\\rho$.\n-   The relationship between electric power $P$ and useful heat $H$ is one of proportionality.\n-   Minimum electric power limit: $P^{\\min} = 20$ MW$_{\\mathrm{e}}$.\n-   Maximum electric power limit: $P^{\\max} = 100$ MW$_{\\mathrm{e}}$.\n-   Heat-to-power ratio: $\\rho = 1.8$.\n-   Absolute tolerance on heat-power proportionality: $\\epsilon = 3$ MW$_{\\mathrm{th}}$.\n-   Scheduled electric loading: $P = 65$ MW$_{\\mathrm{e}}$.\n-   The required output is the feasible thermal output interval at the specified loading, expressed as an ordered pair $(H^{\\min}_{\\text{feas}}, H^{\\max}_{\\text{feas}})$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. The model of a back-pressure CHP unit with a fixed heat-to-power ratio is a standard and fundamental representation in energy systems engineering and thermodynamics. The relationship $H = \\rho P$ is a direct consequence of the energy balance in a topping cycle where low-pressure steam, after passing through a turbine to generate electricity, is used for process heat. The inclusion of operating limits ($P^{\\min}$, $P^{\\max}$) and a tolerance band ($\\epsilon$) are standard practices in realistic modeling to account for physical constraints and uncertainties.\n\nThe problem is well-posed. It provides all necessary parameters ($\\rho$, $P$, $\\epsilon$, $P^{\\min}$, $P^{\\max}$) to determine a unique solution. The scheduled power $P = 65$ MW$_{\\mathrm{e}}$ is within the operational range $[20, 100]$ MW$_{\\mathrm{e}}$, making the requested state feasible. The language is objective and unambiguous. The problem does not violate any physical laws, is not based on false premises, and is directly formalizable.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be constructed based on the provided information and fundamental principles.\n\nThe core principle for a back-pressure CHP unit is the linear relationship between the generated electric power, $P$, and the useful thermal output, $H$. This relationship is defined by the heat-to-power ratio, $\\rho$. In an idealized model, the feasible operating points $(P, H)$ lie on a line segment described by the equation:\n$$H = \\rho P$$\nfor $P \\in [P^{\\min}, P^{\\max}]$.\n\nThe problem provides the following specific values for the parameters:\n-   Heat-to-power ratio: $\\rho = 1.8$\n-   Scheduled electric power output: $P = 65$ MW$_{\\mathrm{e}}$\n\nUnder ideal conditions, the nominal thermal output, which we shall denote as $H_{\\text{nom}}$, corresponding to the scheduled electric power $P = 65$ MW$_{\\mathrm{e}}$ would be:\n$$H_{\\text{nom}} = \\rho \\times P$$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$H_{\\text{nom}} = 1.8 \\times 65$$\n$$H_{\\text{nom}} = 117 \\text{ MW}_{\\mathrm{th}}$$\n\nThe problem states that an absolute tolerance $\\epsilon = 3$ MW$_{\\mathrm{th}}$ is permitted on the heat-power proportionality. This tolerance accounts for real-world effects such as measurement errors, minor fluctuations in steam conditions, and modeling simplifications. This means that for a given electric power output $P$, the actual thermal output $H$ can deviate from the nominal value $H_{\\text{nom}}$ by an amount up to $\\epsilon$. This is mathematically expressed as an inequality:\n$$|H - H_{\\text{nom}}| \\le \\epsilon$$\n\nThis inequality defines the feasible range for the thermal output $H$. It can be expanded as:\n$$-\\epsilon \\le H - H_{\\text{nom}} \\le \\epsilon$$\nAdding $H_{\\text{nom}}$ to all parts of the inequality gives the interval for the feasible thermal output:\n$$H_{\\text{nom}} - \\epsilon \\le H \\le H_{\\text{nom}} + \\epsilon$$\n\nThe lower and upper bounds of this feasible thermal output interval, $H^{\\min}_{\\text{feas}}$ and $H^{\\max}_{\\text{feas}}$, are therefore:\n$$H^{\\min}_{\\text{feas}} = H_{\\text{nom}} - \\epsilon$$\n$$H^{\\max}_{\\text{feas}} = H_{\\text{nom}} + \\epsilon$$\n\nWe now substitute the calculated nominal thermal output $H_{\\text{nom}} = 117$ MW$_{\\mathrm{th}}$ and the given tolerance $\\epsilon = 3$ MW$_{\\mathrm{th}}$ to find the numerical values for these bounds.\n\nThe lower bound is:\n$$H^{\\min}_{\\text{feas}} = 117 - 3 = 114 \\text{ MW}_{\\mathrm{th}}$$\n\nThe upper bound is:\n$$H^{\\max}_{\\text{feas}} = 117 + 3 = 120 \\text{ MW}_{\\mathrm{th}}$$\n\nThus, at an electric loading of $P = 65$ MW$_{\\mathrm{e}}$, the feasible thermal output ranges from $114$ MW$_{\\mathrm{th}}$ to $120$ MW$_{\\mathrm{th}}$. The problem requests the answer as the ordered pair $(H^{\\min}_{\\text{feas}}, H^{\\max}_{\\text{feas}})$.\nThe resulting ordered pair is $(114, 120)$.",
