            "problem": "A single thermal generating unit is modeled in discrete time with period length $\\Delta t = 1$ hour. Let $t \\in \\{1,2,\\dots\\}$ index periods and let $p_t$ denote the unit’s electrical output in megawatts, with $u_t \\in \\{0,1\\}$ indicating the on/off commitment status. The unit obeys three standard constraints in energy systems modeling: a minimum stable output constraint, a maximum output constraint, and an inter-temporal ramp-up limit stemming from the generator’s finite rate-of-change capability due to thermal inertia. Specifically, for each period $t$,\n- the minimum output constraint is $p_t \\ge P^{\\min} u_t$,\n- the maximum output constraint is $p_t \\le P^{\\max} u_t$,\n- the ramp-up limit (defined as the maximum increase in output per period) is $p_t - p_{t-1} \\le RU$.\n\nAssume the generator is initially off with $u_0 = 0$ and $p_0 = 0$. The unit is committed starting in period $t=1$, so $u_t = 1$ for all $t \\ge 1$. The parameters are $P^{\\min} = 300$ megawatts, $P^{\\max} = 500$ megawatts, and a ramp-up limit $RU = 80$ megawatts per hour. There is no separate startup ramp parameter; the same ramp-up limit applies upon startup. Under these conditions, scheduling $p_t$ at or above $P^{\\min}$ in the first on-period may be impossible if the ramp-up limit is low because the inter-temporal rate-of-change constraint can prevent reaching the minimum stable output within a single period from zero.\n\nDetermine the earliest period index $t^{\\star} \\ge 1$ at which there exists a feasible $p_{t^{\\star}}$ satisfying $p_{t^{\\star}} \\ge P^{\\min}$, given the above constraints and initial condition.

It is free from subjective claims.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and internally consistent. It is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe objective is to find the earliest time period, denoted as $t^{\\star}$, with $t^{\\star} \\ge 1$, at which it is possible for the generator's output $p_{t^{\\star}}$ to satisfy the minimum output constraint, $p_{t^{\\star}} \\ge P^{\\min}$, while adhering to all other constraints.\n\nThe constraints for any time period $t \\ge 1$ are:\n1. $p_t \\ge P^{\\min} u_t \\implies p_t \\ge 300$ (since $u_t=1$ for $t \\ge 1$)\n2. $p_t \\le P^{\\max} u_t \\implies p_t \\le 500$\n3. $p_t - p_{t-1} \\le RU \\implies p_t \\le p_{t-1} + 80$\n\nLet us examine the conditions for the first period, $t=1$. The initial condition is $p_0 = 0$.\nThe ramp-up constraint for $t=1$ is $p_1 - p_0 \\le RU$, which simplifies to $p_1 \\le 0 + 80$, or $p_1 \\le 80$.\nThe minimum output constraint for $t=1$ is $p_1 \\ge P^{\\min}$, or $p_1 \\ge 300$.\nTo be feasible at $t=1$, $p_1$ would have to satisfy both $p_1 \\ge 300$ and $p_1 \\le 80$. This is a contradiction, meaning there is no feasible power output at $t=1$ that satisfies all constraints simultaneously.\n\nThis confirms the problem statement's remark that meeting the minimum output level in the first period may be impossible. This implies that the constraint $p_t \\ge P^{\\min}$ is not required to be met during the initial startup phase. The problem asks for the *earliest* time $t^{\\star}$ when it *becomes possible* to satisfy $p_{t^{\\star}} \\ge P^{\\min}$. This requires that a feasible power trajectory $(p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_{t^{\\star}})$ exists where, for $t < t^{\\star}$, the output may be below $P^{\\min}$ (i.e., $0 \\le p_t < P^{\\min}$), and at $t=t^{\\star}$, the output can finally meet or exceed $P^{\\min}$.\n\nTo find the earliest possible time $t^{\\star}$, we must consider the fastest possible startup trajectory. This is achieved by increasing the generator's output by the maximum ramp-up value, $RU$, in each period. Let's define this trajectory as $\\hat{p}_t$.\nThe initial state is $\\hat{p}_0 = 0$.\nFor $t=1$, the maximum possible output is $\\hat{p}_1 = \\hat{p}_0 + RU = 0 + 80 = 80$.\nFor $t=2$, the maximum possible output is $\\hat{p}_2 = \\hat{p}_1 + RU = 80 + 80 = 160$.\nIn general, the maximum achievable power output at time $t$, assuming an unconstrained ramp from $p_0=0$, is given by:\n$$ \\hat{p}_t = t \\cdot RU $$\nThis trajectory respects the ramp-up constraint by construction. We also need to ensure it respects the maximum output constraint, $\\hat{p}_t \\le P^{\\max}$, which holds as long as $t \\cdot RU \\le P^{\\max}$.\n\nWe are looking for the smallest integer $t \\ge 1$, which we denote $t^{\\star}$, at which this maximum achievable power level is at least $P^{\\min}$.\nThe condition is:\n$$ \\hat{p}_{t^{\\star}} \\ge P^{\\min} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\hat{p}_{t^{\\star}}$:\n$$ t^{\\star} \\cdot RU \\ge P^{\\min} $$\nWe can solve for $t^{\\star}$:\n$$ t^{\\star} \\ge \\frac{P^{\\min}}{RU} $$\nSubstituting the given numerical values, $P^{\\min} = 300$ and $RU = 80$:\n$$ t^{\\star} \\ge \\frac{300}{80} = \\frac{30}{8} = \\frac{15}{4} = 3.75 $$\nSince the time index $t^{\\star}$ must be an integer, the smallest integer value for $t^{\\star}$ that satisfies this inequality is $4$. This can be formally expressed using the ceiling function:\n$$ t^{\\star} = \\left\\lceil \\frac{P^{\\min}}{RU} \\right\\rceil = \\lceil 3.75 \\rceil = 4 $$\n\nLet's verify the feasibility at $t^{\\star} = 4$.\nAt $t=3$, the maximum achievable power is $\\hat{p}_3 = 3 \\cdot 80 = 240$. So we can choose a feasible $p_3 = 240$, which is less than $P^{\\min}$.\nAt $t=4$, the ramp-up constraint requires $p_4 \\le p_3 + RU = 240 + 80 = 320$.\nThe constraints on $p_4$ are:\n- $p_4 \\ge P^{\\min} \\implies p_4 \\ge 300$\n- $p_4 \\le P^{\\max} \\implies p_4 \\le 500$\n- $p_4 \\le p_3 + RU \\implies p_4 \\le 320$\nCombining these, a feasible power output $p_4$ must lie in the interval $[300, 320]$. Since this interval is non-empty (e.g., $p_4 = 310$ is a valid choice), a feasible solution exists at $t=4$. For any $t < 4$, the maximum achievable power is $t \\cdot 80$, which is less than $300$. Therefore, $t=4$ is the earliest period where the minimum output constraint can be satisfied.",

A solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\nThe problem asks for the threshold value of system demand, $D$, below which the current commitment of three units ($A$, $B$, and $C$) becomes infeasible due to their minimum output constraints.\n\nThe system is governed by two fundamental sets of constraints for the given operating interval:\n1. The power balance equation, which requires total generation to exactly meet the demand:\n$$p_{A} + p_{B} + p_{C} = D$$\n2. The individual unit operating limits, which state that each unit's output must be between its minimum and maximum stable levels:\n$$m_{A} \\leq p_{A} \\leq M_{A}$$\n$$m_{B} \\leq p_{B} \\leq M_{B}$$\n$$m_{C} \\leq p_{C} \\leq M_{C}$$\n\nFor a feasible dispatch to exist for the committed fleet $\\{A, B, C\\}$, there must be a set of power outputs $\\{p_{A}, p_{B}, p_{C}\\}$ that simultaneously satisfies all these conditions for a given demand $D$.\n\nTo find the range of demand $D$ that can be feasibly met by this set of committed units, we must determine the minimum and maximum possible aggregate power output. Let the total generation be $P_{total} = p_{A} + p_{B} + p_{C}$. From the power balance equation, $D = P_{total}$.\n\nTo find the minimum possible total generation, we sum the minimum output constraints for each unit:\n$$p_{A} \\geq m_{A}$$\n$$p_{B} \\geq m_{B}$$\n$$p_{C} \\geq m_{C}$$\nSumming these inequalities yields:\n$$p_{A} + p_{B} + p_{C} \\geq m_{A} + m_{B} + m_{C}$$\nThus, the minimum possible value for the total generation, $P_{total, min}$, is the sum of the individual minimum outputs. This minimum is achieved when each unit operates at its minimum level, i.e., $p_{i} = m_{i}$ for all $i$.\n$$P_{total, min} = m_{A} + m_{B} + m_{C}$$\n\nSimilarly, to find the maximum possible total generation, we sum the maximum output constraints for each unit:\n$$p_{A} \\leq M_{A}$$\n$$p_{B} \\leq M_{B}$$\n$$p_{C} \\leq M_{C}$$\nSumming these inequalities yields:\n$$p_{A} + p_{B} + p_{C} \\leq M_{A} + M_{B} + M_{C}$$\nThe maximum possible value for the total generation, $P_{total, max}$, is the sum of the individual maximum outputs.\n$$P_{total, max} = M_{A} + M_{B} + M_{C}$$\n\nTherefore, for the three-unit commitment to be feasible, the system demand $D$ must lie within the range defined by the minimum and maximum possible aggregate generation:\n$$P_{total, min} \\leq D \\leq P_{total, max}$$\n$$m_{A} + m_{B} + m_{C} \\leq D \\leq M_{A} + M_{B} + M_{C}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the threshold value of $D$ below which decommitment is optimal due to feasibility considerations from minimum output limits. This corresponds to the lower bound of the feasible demand range. If the demand $D$ falls below $P_{total, min}$, it becomes impossible to satisfy the power balance equation $p_A + p_B + p_C = D$, because the left-hand side has a minimum value of $P_{total, min}$. In this situation, the total generation would exceed the demand even with all units producing at their lowest possible levels. To restore feasibility (i.e., to be able to reduce generation to meet the lower demand), at least one unit must be shut down (decommitted). Therefore, the threshold is precisely $P_{total, min}$.\n\nLet this threshold be $D_{threshold, min}$.\n$$D_{threshold, min} = m_{A} + m_{B} + m_{C}$$\n\nUsing the given data:\n- $m_{A} = 80$ MW\n- $m_{B} = 60$ MW\n- $m_{C} = 50$ MW\n\nWe can compute the numerical value of this threshold:\n$$D_{threshold, min} = 80 \\, \\text{MW} + 60 \\, \\text{MW} + 50 \\, \\text{MW}$$\n$$D_{threshold, min} = 190 \\, \\text{MW}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the result to be rounded to four significant figures.

The model uses standard constraints (power balance, generation limits) and a linear cost function, which are foundational principles in energy systems modeling. The formulation as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) is standard. The problem is scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. For each case, an objective function (cost) is to be minimized over a compact set of decision variables defined by linear constraints. A solution is guaranteed to exist. Since the number of units is small, an exact solution can be found by enumeration.\n3.  **Objective**: The language is precise, quantitative, and free of subjectivity. All terms are clearly defined.\n4.  **Completeness**: All necessary parameters ($P^{\\min}$, $P^{\\max}$, $c$, $D$) are provided. The problem is self-contained.\n5.  **Realism**: The parameters are realistic for small-scale thermal generators. The scenarios cover a range from very low to high demand, which are relevant for testing the impact of minimum output constraints.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. It is a well-defined mathematical optimization problem grounded in established principles of energy systems engineering. I will proceed with the solution.\n\n### Principle-Based Design\nThe problem is a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP). The integer variables are the commitment decisions $u_i \\in \\{0,1\\}$, and the continuous variables are the power outputs $p_i$ and spillage $s$. The objective is to minimize the total production cost. Since there are only $3$ units, there are $2^3 = 8$ possible commitment combinations (e.g., unit $1$ on, units $2,3$ off). The problem can be solved exactly by enumerating all $8$ commitment states, calculating the minimum cost for each feasible state, and selecting the state with the overall minimum cost.\n\nFor a fixed commitment state (i.e., a fixed set of $u_i$ values), the problem simplifies to a linear program. Let $U = (u_1, u_2, u_3)$ be a specific commitment state.\n\n1.  **Feasibility and Required Production**:\n    The set of committed units is $I_{on} = \\{i | u_i = 1\\}$.\n    The total minimum generation for this state is $P_{\\min}^{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{i \\in I_{on}} P_i^{\\min}$.\n    The total maximum generation is $P_{\\max}^{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{i \\in I_{on}} P_i^{\\max}$.\n    The total power to be produced, $P_{\\text{prod}}$, must satisfy the demand $D$ and the minimum generation levels. From the power balance equation, $P_{\\text{prod}} = \\sum p_i = D+s$. Since $s \\ge 0$, we must have $P_{\\text{prod}} \\ge D$. Also, from the unit capability constraints, we must have $P_{\\text{prod}} \\ge P_{\\min}^{\\text{total}}$. Therefore, the required total production is $P_{\\text{req}} = \\max(D, P_{\\min}^{\\text{total}})$.\n    A commitment state $U$ is feasible if this required production can be supplied: $P_{\\text{req}} \\le P_{\\max}^{\\text{total}}$. If a state is infeasible, it is discarded. The spillage is then calculated as $s = P_{\\text{req}} - D$.\n\n2.  **Optimal Dispatch for a Feasible Commitment**:\n    Once $P_{\\text{req}}$ is determined for a feasible commitment state, we must dispatch this power among the committed units $\\{i | u_i = 1\\}$ to minimize cost. The cost function is linear: $\\sum c_i p_i$. This is a classic economic dispatch problem. The optimal strategy is to load units in \"merit order\" of their cost $c_i$ (from cheapest to most expensive).\n    The dispatch algorithm is as follows:\n    a. First, each committed unit $i \\in I_{on}$ must produce at least its minimum output $P_i^{\\min}$. This accounts for $P_{\\min}^{\\text{total}}$ of the required power.\n    b. The remaining power, $\\Delta P = P_{\\text{req}} - P_{\\min}^{\\text{total}}$, must be supplied by the committed units. To do this at minimum cost, we add this power to the committed units incrementally, starting with the one with the lowest $c_i$, up to its $P_i^{\\max}$, then moving to the next cheapest, and so on, until the total production equals $P_{\\text{req}}$.\n\n3.  **Solving for Case A vs. Case B**:\n    - **Case A (Actual $P_i^{\\min}$)**: The full algorithm described above is applied, enumerating all $8$ commitment states and finding the minimum cost dispatch for each.\n    - **Case B ($P_i^{\\min} = 0$)**: In this case, $P_{\\min}^{\\text{total}} = 0$ for any commitment. The required production is always $P_{\\text{req}} = \\max(D, 0) = D$. There is never any spillage ($s=0$). The problem simplifies to a pure economic dispatch: meet demand $D$ by loading the units in strict merit order ($c_1 < c_2 < c_3$) up to their maximum capacities, committing them as needed. This does not require enumerating all $8$ states; a single pass through the merit order is sufficient to find the optimal cost.\n\n4.  **Final Calculation**: For each demand level $D$ from the test cases, we calculate $\\text{Cost}_A$ and $\\text{Cost}_B$ using the respective methods and find the difference $\\Delta = \\text{Cost}_A - \\text{Cost}_B$.\n\nThe algorithm will be implemented in Python. We will define the unit parameters and test cases, then create a function to solve the MILP for a given demand and set of unit parameters. A separate, simpler function will solve the economic dispatch for Case B. The main loop will iterate through the test cases and compute the required cost differences.",
