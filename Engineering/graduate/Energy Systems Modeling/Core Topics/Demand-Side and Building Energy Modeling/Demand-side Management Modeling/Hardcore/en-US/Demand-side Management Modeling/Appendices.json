The use of a linear marginal cost function ($MC$) corresponding to a quadratic total cost function ($C$) is a standard and valid model for a simplified electricity generation stack. The condition $\\beta > 0$ ensures the cost function is convex ($C''(g) = \\beta > 0$), which correctly models the economic principle of dispatching cheaper generation units first, leading to increasing marginal costs. The relationship between the total cost and marginal cost is consistent, as the derivative of the given total cost function $C(g)$ with respect to generation $g$ is $\\frac{d}{dg}(\\alpha g + \\frac{1}{2}\\beta g^{2}) = \\alpha + \\beta g$, which is the given marginal cost function $MC(g)$.\n-   **Well-Posed:** The problem is well-posed. All necessary functions, parameters, and constraints are explicitly defined. The objective is clear and unambiguous, asking for a specific analytical derivation. The given information is sufficient to derive a unique solution.\n-   **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, and mathematical language, free of any subjective or opinion-based content.\n-   **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained. The provided data and definitions are complete and internally consistent. For example, the constraint $\\Delta \\leq d_h$ ensures the post-shift load in the high-cost period, $d_h - \\Delta$, is non-negative. The \"no change in total energy\" condition is also well-defined.\n-   **Realism:** The model is \"stylized,\" as stated, but its components are based on realistic principles. The assumptions of no losses or rebound effects are common simplifications in introductory models to isolate the primary economic effect of load shifting.\n-   **Structure:** The problem is logically structured and requires a straightforward derivation based on the provided definitions. It is not ill-posed, trivial, or circular.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid as it is mathematically consistent, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe total cost of the system is the sum of the costs in the two periods. The cost in each period is determined by the total variable production cost function $C(g)=\\alpha g+\\frac{1}{2}\\beta g^{2}$.\n\nFirst, we define the total system cost in the baseline scenario, denoted as $C_{total}^{base}$. In this scenario, the generation in the high-cost and low-cost periods is equal to the respective net loads, $d_h$ and $d_\\ell$.\n$$C_{total}^{base} = C(d_h) + C(d_\\ell)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C(g)$, we have:\n$$C_{total}^{base} = \\left(\\alpha d_h + \\frac{1}{2}\\beta d_h^2\\right) + \\left(\\alpha d_\\ell + \\frac{1}{2}\\beta d_\\ell^2\\right)$$\n\nNext, we define the total system cost after the DSM intervention, denoted as $C_{total}^{post}$. The intervention shifts $\\Delta$ units of energy from the high-cost period to the low-cost period.\nThe new generation level in the high-cost period is $g_h^{post} = d_h - \\Delta$.\nThe new generation level in the low-cost period is $g_\\ell^{post} = d_\\ell + \\Delta$.\nThe total cost in the post-shift scenario is:\n$$C_{total}^{post} = C(g_h^{post}) + C(g_\\ell^{post}) = C(d_h - \\Delta) + C(d_\\ell + \\Delta)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $C(g)$:\n$$C_{total}^{post} = \\left[\\alpha(d_h - \\Delta) + \\frac{1}{2}\\beta(d_h - \\Delta)^2\\right] + \\left[\\alpha(d_\\ell + \\Delta) + \\frac{1}{2}\\beta(d_\\ell + \\Delta)^2\\right]$$\n\nThe system production cost savings, which we denote as $S$, are defined as the baseline total cost minus the post-shift total cost.\n$$S = C_{total}^{base} - C_{total}^{post}$$\nSubstituting the detailed expressions for the costs:\n$$S = \\left[ \\left(\\alpha d_h + \\frac{1}{2}\\beta d_h^2\\right) + \\left(\\alpha d_\\ell + \\frac{1}{2}\\beta d_\\ell^2\\right) \\right] - \\left[ \\left(\\alpha(d_h - \\Delta) + \\frac{1}{2}\\beta(d_h - \\Delta)^2\\right) + \\left(\\alpha(d_\\ell + \\Delta) + \\frac{1}{2}\\beta(d_\\ell + \\Delta)^2\\right) \\right]$$\n\nWe now simplify this expression by grouping terms with $\\alpha$ and terms with $\\beta$.\nThe terms containing $\\alpha$ are:\n$$(\\alpha d_h + \\alpha d_\\ell) - (\\alpha(d_h - \\Delta) + \\alpha(d_\\ell + \\Delta))$$\n$$= \\alpha d_h + \\alpha d_\\ell - (\\alpha d_h - \\alpha\\Delta + \\alpha d_\\ell + \\alpha\\Delta)$$\n$$= \\alpha d_h + \\alpha d_\\ell - (\\alpha d_h + \\alpha d_\\ell) = 0$$\nAs expected, the terms linear in generation cancel out because total generation across the two periods, $(d_h - \\Delta) + (d_\\ell + \\Delta) = d_h + d_\\ell$, is conserved.\n\nThe remaining terms containing $\\beta$ determine the savings:\n$$S = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\beta d_h^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\beta d_\\ell^2\\right) - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\beta(d_h - \\Delta)^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\beta(d_\\ell + \\Delta)^2\\right)$$\nFactoring out $\\frac{1}{2}\\beta$:\n$$S = \\frac{1}{2}\\beta \\left[ (d_h^2 + d_\\ell^2) - \\left((d_h - \\Delta)^2 + (d_\\ell + \\Delta)^2\\right) \\right]$$\nExpand the squared terms:\n$$(d_h - \\Delta)^2 = d_h^2 - 2d_h\\Delta + \\Delta^2$$\n$$(d_\\ell + \\Delta)^2 = d_\\ell^2 + 2d_\\ell\\Delta + \\Delta^2$$\nSubstitute these expansions back into the expression for $S$:\n$$S = \\frac{1}{2}\\beta \\left[ (d_h^2 + d_\\ell^2) - (d_h^2 - 2d_h\\Delta + \\Delta^2 + d_\\ell^2 + 2d_\\ell\\Delta + \\Delta^2) \\right]$$\nSimplify the expression inside the brackets:\n$$S = \\frac{1}{2}\\beta \\left[ d_h^2 + d_\\ell^2 - d_h^2 + 2d_h\\Delta - \\Delta^2 - d_\\ell^2 - 2d_\\ell\\Delta - \\Delta^2 \\right]$$\nThe terms $d_h^2$ and $d_\\ell^2$ cancel out.\n$$S = \\frac{1}{2}\\beta \\left[ 2d_h\\Delta - 2d_\\ell\\Delta - 2\\Delta^2 \\right]$$\nFactor out $2\\Delta$ from the bracketed term:\n$$S = \\frac{1}{2}\\beta \\cdot 2\\Delta \\left[ (d_h - d_\\ell) - \\Delta \\right]$$\nThis simplifies to the final closed-form expression for the cost savings:\n$$S = \\beta \\Delta (d_h - d_\\ell - \\Delta)$$\nThis expression represents the total production cost savings in dollars, resulting from the DSM-induced shift of $\\Delta$ units of energy consumption. The savings are positive if the amount shifted, $\\Delta$, is less than the initial difference in loads, $d_h - d_\\ell$. The convexity of the cost function, ensured by $\\beta > 0$, is the fundamental driver of these savings.",

            "problem": "A utility is designing a Demand-Side Management (DSM) program over a $6$-hour horizon with hourly time steps indexed by $t \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$. Two customer appliances, indexed by $a \\in \\{1,2\\}$, are shiftable and each requires exactly $2$ consecutive hours of operation at a constant power of 1 kilowatt ($1\\,\\mathrm{kW}$). The system enforces a capacity constraint such that at most $1\\ \\mathrm{kW}$ runs simultaneously.

Express the final minimal total cost in dollars and round your answer to four significant figures. Use dollars as the unit for the cost (do not include units in the final boxed answer).",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the minimal total cost to operate two appliances under a specific set of constraints. This is a classic load scheduling optimization problem. We will determine the solution from first principles by analyzing the structure of feasible schedules and their associated costs.\n\nFirst, we formalize the problem based on the provided information.\nThe time horizon consists of $6$ discrete hourly steps, $t \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$.\nThere are two appliances, $a \\in \\{1, 2\\}$. Each must run for exactly $2$ consecutive hours.\nThe power consumption of an active appliance is $P = 1 \\text{ kW}$.\nThe time step duration is $\\Delta t = 1 \\text{ h}$.\nThe energy consumed by one appliance in one active hour is $E_{hour} = P \\times \\Delta t = 1 \\text{ kW} \\times 1 \\text{ h} = 1 \\text{ kWh}$.\nThe prices $p_t$ are given in units of \\$/MWh. We must convert the energy to MWh: $E_{hour} = 1 \\text{ kWh} = 10^{-3} \\text{ MWh}$.\nThe hourly prices are given by the vector $(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4, p_5, p_6) = (30, 100, 80, 40, 20, 60)$ in \\$/MWh.\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine the optimal start times for the two appliances. Let $s_a$ be the start time for a $2$-hour operation of appliance $a$. The possible start times for a $2$-hour task within a $6$-hour horizon are $s_a \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$. If an appliance starts at time $s$, it operates during hours $s$ and $s+1$.\n\nThe cost of running one appliance starting at time $s$ is the sum of the energy costs for hours $s$ and $s+1$. Since both appliances have the same power rating, this cost depends only on the start time $s$. Let's denote this cost as $C(s)$:\n$$C(s) = (p_s \\cdot E_{hour}) + (p_{s+1} \\cdot E_{hour}) = (p_s + p_{s+1}) \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ dollars}$$\n\nLet's calculate the cost for each possible $2$-hour operational block:\nFor a start time $s=1$ (operation in hours $1, 2$):\n$C(1) = (p_1 + p_2) \\times 10^{-3} = (30 + 100) \\times 10^{-3} = 130 \\times 10^{-3}$ dollars.\nFor a start time $s=2$ (operation in hours $2, 3$):\n$C(2) = (p_2 + p_3) \\times 10^{-3} = (100 + 80) \\times 10^{-3} = 180 \\times 10^{-3}$ dollars.\nFor a start time $s=3$ (operation in hours $3, 4$):\n$C(3) = (p_3 + p_4) \\times 10^{-3} = (80 + 40) \\times 10^{-3} = 120 \\times 10^{-3}$ dollars.\nFor a start time $s=4$ (operation in hours $4, 5$):\n$C(4) = (p_4 + p_5) \\times 10^{-3} = (40 + 20) \\times 10^{-3} = 60 \\times 10^{-3}$ dollars.\nFor a start time $s=5$ (operation in hours $5, 6$):\n$C(5) = (p_5 + p_6) \\times 10^{-3} = (20 + 60) \\times 10^{-3} = 80 \\times 10^{-3}$ dollars.\n\nThe system has a capacity constraint that at most $1 \\text{ kW}$ can run simultaneously. This means that the two appliances cannot operate during the same hour. If appliance $1$ starts at $s_1$ and appliance $2$ starts at $s_2$, their operational intervals are $[s_1, s_1+1]$ and $[s_2, s_2+1]$. For these intervals to be disjoint, the start times must be sufficiently separated. An overlap occurs if $s_1 = s_2$, or if one appliance starts one hour after the other (e.g., $s_2 = s_1+1$). Therefore, the start times must be separated by at least $2$ hours, which is expressed mathematically as $|s_1 - s_2| \\geq 2$.\n\nThe problem is now reduced to selecting two distinct start times $s_a$ and $s_b$ from the set $\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\\}$ such that $|s_a - s_b| \\geq 2$, and the total cost $C(s_a) + C(s_b)$ is minimized. We can find the minimum cost by systematically enumerating all valid pairs of start times. Let's assume $s_a < s_b$ without loss of generality.\n\nThe valid pairs $(s_a, s_b)$ satisfying $s_b - s_a \\geq 2$ and their corresponding total costs are:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item Pair $(1, 3)$: Appliances start at $t=1$ and $t=3$. The schedules are disjoint.\n    Total Cost = $C(1) + C(3) = (130 + 120) \\times 10^{-3} = 250 \\times 10^{-3} = 0.250$ dollars.\n    \\item Pair $(1, 4)$: Appliances start at $t=1$ and $t=4$. The schedules are disjoint.\n    Total Cost = $C(1) + C(4) = (130 + 60) \\times 10^{-3} = 190 \\times 10^{-3} = 0.190$ dollars.\n    \\item Pair $(1, 5)$: Appliances start at $t=1$ and $t=5$. The schedules are disjoint.\n    Total Cost = $C(1) + C(5) = (130 + 80) \\times 10^{-3} = 210 \\times 10^{-3} = 0.210$ dollars.\n    \\item Pair $(2, 4)$: Appliances start at $t=2$ and $t=4$. The schedules are disjoint.\n    Total Cost = $C(2) + C(4) = (180 + 60) \\times 10^{-3} = 240 \\times 10^{-3} = 0.240$ dollars.\n    \\item Pair $(2, 5)$: Appliances start at $t=2$ and $t=5$. The schedules are disjoint.\n    Total Cost = $C(2) + C(5) = (180 + 80) \\times 10^{-3} = 260 \\times 10^{-3} = 0.260$ dollars.\n    \\item Pair $(3, 5)$: Appliances start at $t=3$ and $t=5$. The schedules are disjoint.\n    Total Cost = $C(3) + C(5) = (120 + 80) \\times 10^{-3} = 200 \\times 10^{-3} = 0.200$ dollars.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nComparing the total costs calculated for each valid pair, the minimum value is $0.190$ dollars. This cost corresponds to the schedule where one appliance starts at $t=1$ (running in hours $1$ and $2$) and the other starts at $t=4$ (running in hours $4$ and $5$).\n\nThe total energy consumed in this optimal schedule is over hours $1, 2, 4,$ and $5$. The total cost is:\nCost = $(p_1 + p_2 + p_4 + p_5) \\times 10^{-3} = (30 + 100 + 40 + 20) \\times 10^{-3} = 190 \\times 10^{-3} = 0.190$ dollars.\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures. The calculated minimal cost is $0.190$. To express this value with four significant figures, we write it as $0.1900$.",
