This foundational exercise guides you through constructing the LCOE formula for a conventional thermal power plant, starting from the principle of equating the net present value of costs and revenues.

            "problem": "A thermal power plant fueled by natural gas operates at steady output and produces $E$ megawatt-hours per year for $n$ years. The project incurs an upfront capital expenditure $I$ at time $t=0$, a fixed operations and maintenance cost $A$ per year paid at the end of each year $t \\in \\{1,\\dots,n\\}$, a variable operations and maintenance cost $v$ per megawatt-hour, and a fuel cost $f$ per megawatt-hour. Assume that delivered energy $E$ and the cost rates $A$, $v$, and $f$ are constant over time, there is no residual value or decommissioning cost, and the real discount rate is a constant $r0$. All annual costs and energy occur at the end of each year.\n\nStarting only from the fundamental definition that the Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) is the constant price per megawatt-hour that equates the present value of all costs to the present value of all energy, derive a closed-form expression for the LCOE in terms of $I$, $A$, $v$, $f$, $E$, $r$, and $n$. Then, define the fuel-and-variable-cost share of LCOE as the fraction of the LCOE attributable to fuel plus variable operations and maintenance, and derive a closed-form expression for this share as a function of the same parameters. Finally, evaluate the limiting form of the LCOE as $n \\to \\infty$ for fixed $r0$.\n\nProvide your final answer as a row vector containing, in order: \n(i) the LCOE expression, \n(ii) the fuel-and-variable-cost share expression written as a decimal fraction (not a percentage), \n(iii) the limiting LCOE as $n \\to \\infty$ with $r0$. \nNo numerical evaluation is required.

It is based on established financial mathematics.\n- **Well-Posed:** All necessary parameters ($I$, $A$, $v$, $f$, $E$, $r$, $n$) are provided, and the objective is clearly defined, leading to a unique solution.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative terms, free of subjectivity or ambiguity.\n- The problem is self-contained, consistent, and scientifically sound. No flaws are identified.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. The solution will proceed.\n\nThe Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) is defined as the price per unit of energy at which the net present value of the project is zero. This means the present value of total costs must equal the present value of total revenues, where revenues are calculated using the LCOE as the constant price for the energy produced.\n\nLet $PV_{costs}$ be the present value of all costs incurred over the project's lifetime. The costs consist of the initial investment $I$ at time $t=0$, and annual costs for $n$ years. The present value of the initial investment is simply $I$, as it occurs at $t=0$. The annual costs, paid at the end of each year $t \\in \\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, are the sum of fixed OM $A$, total variable OM ($v \\times E$), and total fuel cost ($f \\times E$).\n\nThe total annual cost, $C_{annual}$, is:\n$$C_{annual} = A + vE + fE = A + (v+f)E$$\nThe present value of these annual costs is the sum of each annual cost discounted to $t=0$:\n$$PV_{annual\\_costs} = \\sum_{t=1}^{n} \\frac{A + (v+f)E}{(1+r)^t} = (A + (v+f)E) \\sum_{t=1}^{n} \\frac{1}{(1+r)^t}$$\nThe total present value of all costs is:\n$$PV_{costs} = I + PV_{annual\\_costs} = I + (A + (v+f)E) \\sum_{t=1}^{n} (1+r)^{-t}$$\n\nNow, let $PV_{revenues}$ be the present value of the revenues generated by selling the energy at the LCOE price. The annual energy production is $E$. At a price of LCOE, the annual revenue is $\\text{LCOE} \\times E$. The present value of this stream of revenues is:\n$$PV_{revenues} = \\sum_{t=1}^{n} \\frac{\\text{LCOE} \\times E}{(1+r)^t} = (\\text{LCOE} \\times E) \\sum_{t=1}^{n} (1+r)^{-t}$$\n\nThe summation term $\\sum_{t=1}^{n} (1+r)^{-t}$ is a finite geometric series with first term $a = (1+r)^{-1}$, ratio $k = (1+r)^{-1}$, and $n$ terms. The sum is given by:\n$$\\sum_{t=1}^{n} k^t = k \\frac{1-k^n}{1-k} = \\frac{1}{1+r} \\frac{1-(1+r)^{-n}}{1 - \\frac{1}{1+r}} = \\frac{1}{1+r} \\frac{1-(1+r)^{-n}}{\\frac{r}{1+r}} = \\frac{1-(1+r)^{-n}}{r}$$\nThis term is the present value annuity factor.\n\nBy definition, for the LCOE, $PV_{costs} = PV_{revenues}$.\n$$I + (A + (v+f)E) \\left(\\frac{1-(1+r)^{-n}}{r}\\right) = (\\text{LCOE} \\times E) \\left(\\frac{1-(1+r)^{-n}}{r}\\right)$$\nThe problem can also be solved using the standard LCOE definition: the ratio of the present value of costs to the present value of energy production.\n$$\\text{LCOE} = \\frac{PV_{costs}}{\\sum_{t=1}^{n} \\frac{E}{(1+r)^t}} = \\frac{I + (A + (v+f)E) \\left(\\frac{1-(1+r)^{-n}}{r}\\right)}{E \\left(\\frac{1-(1+r)^{-n}}{r}\\right)}$$\nSeparating the terms gives:\n$$\\text{LCOE} = \\frac{I}{E \\left(\\frac{1-(1+r)^{-n}}{r}\\right)} + \\frac{A + (v+f)E}{E}$$\n$$\\text{LCOE} = \\frac{Ir}{E(1-(1+r)^{-n})} + \\frac{A}{E} + v + f$$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the LCOE. The term $\\frac{r}{1-(1+r)^{-n}}$ is known as the Capital Recovery Factor (CRF).\n\nNext, we derive the fuel-and-variable-cost share of the LCOE. This is the fraction of the LCOE attributable to the variable OM cost $v$ and the fuel cost $f$. From the final LCOE expression, the components are additive: the levelized capital cost is $\\frac{Ir}{E(1-(1+r)^{-n})}$, the levelized fixed OM cost is $\\frac{A}{E}$, the variable OM cost is $v$, and the fuel cost is $f$.\nThe fuel-and-variable-cost component is $v+f$. The share, which we denote as $S_{v+f}$, is this component divided by the total LCOE.\n$$S_{v+f} = \\frac{v+f}{\\text{LCOE}} = \\frac{v+f}{\\frac{Ir}{E(1-(1+r)^{-n})} + \\frac{A}{E} + v + f}$$\n\nFinally, we evaluate the limit of the LCOE as the project lifetime $n$ approaches infinity, for a fixed positive discount rate $r0$.\n$$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\text{LCOE} = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left( \\frac{Ir}{E(1-(1+r)^{-n})} + \\frac{A}{E} + v + f \\right)$$\nSince $r0$, we have $1+r  1$. Therefore, as $n \\to \\infty$, the term $(1+r)^n \\to \\infty$, and consequently $(1+r)^{-n} = \\frac{1}{(1+r)^n} \\to 0$.\nSubstituting this limit into the expression:\n$$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\text{LCOE} = \\frac{Ir}{E(1-0)} + \\frac{A}{E} + v + f$$\n$$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\text{LCOE} = \\frac{Ir}{E} + \\frac{A}{E} + v + f$$\nThis result is intuitive: for an infinite-lived asset, the annualized capital cost is simply the interest $r$ on the initial investment $I$.\n\nThe final answer requires a row vector containing these three expressions in order.",

It is not tautological, metaphorical, or unverifiable.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is **valid**. The setup is scientifically sound, well-posed, and internally consistent. I will now proceed with the solution.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe solution requires establishing the mathematical relationships between the three defined levelized cost metrics.\n\nFirst, we relate the denominators of the metrics, which are the present values of the different energy quantities. The present value of a time series $X_t$ is given by $PV(X) = \\sum_{t=1}^{N} \\frac{X_t}{(1+r)^t}$.\n\n1.  **Relating $PV(E_{\\mathrm{dis}})$ to $PV(E_{\\mathrm{ch}})$**:\n    Given $E_{\\mathrm{dis},t} = \\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}\\,E_{\\mathrm{ch},t}$ and that $\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}$ is time-invariant:\n    $$PV(E_{\\mathrm{dis}}) = \\sum_{t=1}^{N} \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{dis},t}}{(1+r)^t} = \\sum_{t=1}^{N} \\frac{\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}\\,E_{\\mathrm{ch},t}}{(1+r)^t} = \\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}} \\sum_{t=1}^{N} \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{ch},t}}{(1+r)^t} = \\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}\\,PV(E_{\\mathrm{ch}})$$\n\n2.  **Relating $PV(E_{\\mathrm{firm}})$ to $PV(E_{\\mathrm{dis}})$**:\n    Given $E_{\\mathrm{firm},t} = \\alpha\\,E_{\\mathrm{dis},t}$ and that $\\alpha$ is time-invariant:\n    $$PV(E_{\\mathrm{firm}}) = \\sum_{t=1}^{N} \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{firm},t}}{(1+r)^t} = \\sum_{t=1}^{N} \\frac{\\alpha\\,E_{\\mathrm{dis},t}}{(1+r)^t} = \\alpha \\sum_{t=1}^{N} \\frac{E_{\\mathrm{dis},t}}{(1+r)^t} = \\alpha\\,PV(E_{\\mathrm{dis}})$$\n\nNext, we establish the relationships between the levelized cost metrics using these denominator relationships. The numerator, $PV(C)$, is the same for all three metrics.\n\n1.  **Relating $LCOD_{\\mathrm{dis}}$ to $LCOS_{\\mathrm{ch}}$**:\n    $$LCOD_{\\mathrm{dis}} = \\frac{PV(C)}{PV(E_{\\mathrm{dis}})}$$\n    From the relation $PV(E_{\\mathrm{dis}}) = \\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}\\,PV(E_{\\mathrm{ch}})$, we can write $PV(E_{\\mathrm{ch}}) = \\frac{PV(E_{\\mathrm{dis}})}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}}$.\n    Substituting this into the definition of $LCOS_{\\mathrm{ch}}$:\n    $$LCOS_{\\mathrm{ch}} = \\frac{PV(C)}{PV(E_{\\mathrm{ch}})} = \\frac{PV(C)}{PV(E_{\\mathrm{dis}})/\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}} = \\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}} \\left( \\frac{PV(C)}{PV(E_{\\mathrm{dis}})} \\right) = \\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}\\,LCOD_{\\mathrm{dis}}$$\n    Rearranging, we get the direct relationship:\n    $$LCOD_{\\mathrm{dis}} = \\frac{LCOS_{\\mathrm{ch}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}}$$\n\n2.  **Relating $LCOD_{\\mathrm{firm}}$ to $LCOD_{\\mathrm{dis}}$**:\n    $$LCOD_{\\mathrm{firm}} = \\frac{PV(C)}{PV(E_{\\mathrm{firm}})}$$\n    From the relation $PV(E_{\\mathrm{firm}}) = \\alpha\\,PV(E_{\\mathrm{dis}})$, we substitute this into the definition of $LCOD_{\\mathrm{firm}}$:\n    $$LCOD_{\\mathrm{firm}} = \\frac{PV(C)}{\\alpha\\,PV(E_{\\mathrm{dis}})} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\left( \\frac{PV(C)}{PV(E_{\\mathrm{dis}})} \\right) = \\frac{LCOD_{\\mathrm{dis}}}{\\alpha}$$\n\nIt is critical to note that these relationships, $LCOD_{\\mathrm{dis}} = LCOS_{\\mathrm{ch}}/\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}$ and $LCOD_{\\mathrm{firm}} = LCOD_{\\mathrm{dis}}/\\alpha$, are identities that follow directly from the definitions. They hold true regardless of the specific structure of the cost numerator $PV(C)$, as long as the same $PV(C)$ is used for all three metrics. The inclusion of the throughput-proportional term $v\\,PV(E_{\\mathrm{dis}})$ in the cost model $PV(C) = C_{\\mathrm{fix}} + v\\,PV(E_{\\mathrm{dis}})$ does not alter these conversion factors. To demonstrate this explicitly:\n$$LCOD_{\\mathrm{dis}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{fix}} + v\\,PV(E_{\\mathrm{dis}})}{PV(E_{\\mathrm{dis}})} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{fix}}}{PV(E_{\\mathrm{dis}})} + v$$\n$$LCOS_{\\mathrm{ch}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{fix}} + v\\,PV(E_{\\mathrm{dis}})}{PV(E_{\\mathrm{ch}})} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{fix}} + v\\,(\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}PV(E_{\\mathrm{ch}}))}{PV(E_{\\mathrm{ch}})} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{fix}}}{PV(E_{\\mathrm{ch}})} + v\\,\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}$$\nNow, let's compute $LCOS_{\\mathrm{ch}}/\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}$:\n$$\\frac{LCOS_{\\mathrm{ch}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}} = \\frac{1}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}}\\left( \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{fix}}}{PV(E_{\\mathrm{ch}})} + v\\,\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}} \\right) = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{fix}}}{\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}\\,PV(E_{\\mathrm{ch}})} + v = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{fix}}}{PV(E_{\\mathrm{dis}})} + v$$\nThis is identical to the expression for $LCOD_{\\mathrm{dis}}$, confirming the relationship is independent of the cost structure.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. $LCOD_{\\mathrm{dis}} = LCOS_{\\mathrm{ch}}/\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}$ and $LCOD_{\\mathrm{firm}} = LCOD_{\\mathrm{dis}}/\\alpha$. Consequently, $LCOD_{\\mathrm{firm}} = LCOS_{\\mathrm{ch}}/(\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}\\alpha)$, so using $LCOS_{\\mathrm{ch}}$ to compare against a generator’s Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) understates the per-$\\text{MWh}$ cost of firm delivered service by the multiplicative factor $1/(\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}\\alpha)$.**\n- The relationship $LCOD_{\\mathrm{dis}} = LCOS_{\\mathrm{ch}}/\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}$ was proven correct above.\n- The relationship $LCOD_{\\mathrm{firm}} = LCOD_{\\mathrm{dis}}/\\alpha$ was also proven correct.\n- The consequence $LCOD_{\\mathrm{firm}} = (LCOS_{\\mathrm{ch}}/\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}})/\\alpha = LCOS_{\\mathrm{ch}}/(\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}\\alpha)$ is a correct algebraic substitution.\n- The conceptual point is also correct. The cost of \"firm delivered service\" is $LCOD_{\\mathrm{firm}}$. If one were to mistakenly use $LCOS_{\\mathrm{ch}}$ for comparison, the cost would be understated. The ratio of the correct metric to the incorrect one is $LCOD_{\\mathrm{firm}} / LCOS_{\\mathrm{ch}} = 1/(\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}\\alpha)$. This is the factor of understatement.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. $LCOD_{\\mathrm{dis}}$ is lower than $LCOS_{\\mathrm{ch}}$ because $PV(E_{\\mathrm{dis}})  PV(E_{\\mathrm{ch}})$, and dividing by a smaller denominator yields a smaller levelized cost.**\n- The statement claims $LCOD_{\\mathrm{dis}}  LCOS_{\\mathrm{ch}}$. From our derivation, $LCOD_{\\mathrm{dis}} = LCOS_{\\mathrm{ch}}/\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}$. Since $\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}=0.85  1$, it follows that $1/\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}  1$ and thus $LCOD_{\\mathrm{dis}}  LCOS_{\\mathrm{ch}}$. The claim is false.\n- The reasoning is also false. Dividing a positive numerator, $PV(C)$, by a smaller positive denominator ($PV(E_{\\mathrm{dis}})  PV(E_{\\mathrm{ch}})$) results in a *larger* quotient, not a smaller one.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. When the cost model includes a throughput-proportional term $v\\,PV(E_{\\mathrm{dis}})$, there is no exact conversion between $LCOS_{\\mathrm{ch}}$ and $LCOD_{\\mathrm{dis}}$ using $\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}$ alone; the relation depends on $C_{\\mathrm{fix}}$ and $v$ and cannot be written as a simple scaling.**\n- This is demonstrably false. As proven in the derivation section, the relationship $LCOD_{\\mathrm{dis}} = LCOS_{\\mathrm{ch}}/\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}$ is an exact identity that holds regardless of the values of $C_{\\mathrm{fix}}$ and $v$. The conversion is a simple, exact scaling by $1/\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. With $\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}=0.85$ and $\\alpha=0.90$, the ordering $LCOS_{\\mathrm{ch}}  LCOD_{\\mathrm{dis}}  LCOD_{\\mathrm{firm}}$ holds, and the ratios are $LCOD_{\\mathrm{dis}}/LCOS_{\\mathrm{ch}} = 1/0.85$ and $LCOD_{\\mathrm{firm}}/LCOD_{\\mathrm{dis}} = 1/0.90$, independent of $C_{\\mathrm{fix}}$ and $v$.**\n- **Ordering**: We have $LCOD_{\\mathrm{dis}} = LCOS_{\\mathrm{ch}}/\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}  LCOS_{\\mathrm{ch}}$ (since $\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}  1$) and $LCOD_{\\mathrm{firm}} = LCOD_{\\mathrm{dis}}/\\alpha  LCOD_{\\mathrm{dis}}$ (since $\\alpha  1$). The ordering $LCOS_{\\mathrm{ch}}  LCOD_{\\mathrm{dis}}  LCOD_{\\mathrm{firm}}$ is correct.\n- **Ratios**: From $LCOD_{\\mathrm{dis}} = LCOS_{\\mathrm{ch}}/\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}}$, the ratio $LCOD_{\\mathrm{dis}}/LCOS_{\\mathrm{ch}} = 1/\\eta_{\\mathrm{rt}} = 1/0.85$. This is correct. From $LCOD_{\\mathrm{firm}} = LCOD_{\\mathrm{dis}}/\\alpha$, the ratio $LCOD_{\\mathrm{firm}}/LCOD_{\\mathrm{dis}} = 1/\\alpha = 1/0.90$. This is also correct.\n- **Independence**: As proven, these ratios are identities stemming from the definitions and are independent of the cost structure, i.e., independent of $C_{\\mathrm{fix}}$ and $v$. This is a correct and important statement.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. As long as both a storage metric and a generator metric are expressed in $\\$/\\text{MWh}$, it is valid to compare them directly, regardless of whether the storage metric uses $PV(E_{\\mathrm{ch}})$, $PV(E_{\\mathrm{dis}})$, or $PV(E_{\\mathrm{firm}})$ as its denominator and regardless of whether input charging energy costs are included.**\n- This statement is fundamentally incorrect. The unit $\\$/\\text{MWh}$ is necessary but not sufficient for a valid comparison.\n- The choice of denominator ($E_{\\mathrm{ch}}$, $E_{\\mathrm{dis}}$, $E_{\\mathrm{firm}}$) fundamentally changes what is being measured (cost to store, cost to deliver, cost to deliver firmly). A generator's LCOE is a cost of delivered energy, making $LCOD_{\\mathrm{dis}}$ or $LCOD_{\\mathrm{firm}}$ the conceptually parallel metrics, not $LCOS_{\\mathrm{ch}}$.\n- The inclusion of input energy costs is a critical \"cost boundary\" assumption.

This advanced practice demonstrates that connection by tasking you with minimizing the Levelized Cost of Storage (LCOS) by optimizing a key operational parameter: the battery's depth of discharge (DoD) . You will formalize the trade-off between maximizing energy throughput per cycle and accelerating battery degradation, ultimately deriving the optimal DoD that balances these competing effects to achieve the lowest lifetime cost of service.",

            "problem": "A stationary electrochemical battery of nominal energy capacity $E_{n}$ (in $\\mathrm{kWh}$) is cycled at a constant cycle frequency $\\nu$ (in $\\mathrm{cycles/yr}$) until reaching end-of-life defined by a cycle-life function. The Depth of Discharge (DoD), denoted $D \\in (0,1]$, is held constant across cycles. The round-trip efficiency $\\eta \\in (0,1]$ is constant and independent of $D$. The number of full cycles to end-of-life is a differentiable function $N(D)$ with $N(D) gt; 0$ and $N^{\\prime}(D) lt; 0$. The cycle scheduling is such that the service life in years is $L(D) = N(D)/\\nu$. Let the upfront capital cost be $K$ (in $\\$/\\mathrm{kWh}$ of nominal capacity), the annual fixed Operation and Maintenance (Oamp;M) cost be $F$ (in $\\$/\\mathrm{kWh}\\text{-}\\mathrm{yr}$ of nominal capacity), and the variable cycling cost be $c_{v}$ (in $\\$/\\mathrm{kWh}$ of discharged energy). Assume zero discounting, zero residual value, and no expansions or replacements.\n\nUsing only first principles and definitions, proceed as follows:\n\n1. Starting from the definition that the Levelized Cost of Storage (LCOS) equals the total life-cycle cost divided by the total discharged energy over the asset’s life, express $\\mathrm{LCOS}(D)$ in terms of $D$, $N(D)$, and the parameters $\\eta$, $\\nu$, $E_{n}$, $K$, $F$, and $c_{v}$.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of engineering economics and energy storage modeling, well-posed as a standard optimization problem, and objective in its language. All parameters and functions are clearly defined, and the necessary assumptions (e.g., zero discounting) are explicitly stated. The problem is self-contained and logically consistent.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of LCOS(D)\n\nThe Levelized Cost of Storage (LCOS) is defined as the total life-cycle cost divided by the total discharged energy over the asset's life. We first formulate expressions for the numerator and the denominator.\n\nThe denominator for the LCOS is the Total Discharged Energy ($\\mathrm{TDE}$). The energy discharged per cycle is the nominal capacity $E_n$ times the depth of discharge $D$, adjusted by the round-trip efficiency $\\eta$. However, the convention is that DoD applies to the state of charge, and the discharged energy is the amount delivered. The energy charged to achieve this is higher due to efficiency losses. A more standard interpretation is that the energy discharged per cycle is $E_n D$. The total number of cycles is $N(D)$. The round-trip efficiency $\\eta$ relates the energy discharged to the energy charged. The LCOS denominator should be the total *useful service*, which is the total discharged energy.\n- Energy discharged per cycle: $E_{n} D$\n- Total number of cycles: $N(D)$\n- Total Discharged Energy ($\\mathrm{TDE}$): $E_{n} D N(D)$\n\nThe total life-cycle cost ($\\mathrm{TLCC}$) is the sum of the upfront capital cost, the total fixed OM costs over the lifetime, and the total variable cycling costs.\n\n1.  **Upfront Capital Cost ($\\mathrm{C_{cap}}$)**: The capital cost is given as $K$ in units of $\\$/\\mathrm{kWh}$ of nominal capacity. For a battery with nominal capacity $E_{n}$, this cost is:\n    $$ \\mathrm{C_{cap}} = K E_{n} $$\n\n2.  **Total Fixed OM Cost ($\\mathrm{C_{om,f}}$)**: The fixed OM cost is given as $F$ in units of $\\$/\\mathrm{kWh}\\text{-}\\mathrm{yr}$. This cost is incurred annually over the service life $L(D) = N(D)/\\nu$. Therefore, the total fixed OM cost is:\n    $$ \\mathrm{C_{om,f}} = (F E_{n}) \\times L(D) = F E_{n} \\frac{N(D)}{\\nu} $$\n\n3.  **Total Variable Cost ($\\mathrm{C_{var}}$)**: The variable cycling cost is $c_{v}$ in units of $\\$/\\mathrm{kWh}$ of discharged energy. The total variable cost is then:\n    $$ \\mathrm{C_{var}} = c_{v} \\times (\\mathrm{TDE}) = c_{v} E_{n} D N(D) $$\n\nThe total life-cycle cost is the sum of these components:\n$$ \\mathrm{TLCC}(D) = K E_{n} + F E_{n} \\frac{N(D)}{\\nu} + c_{v} E_{n} D N(D) $$\n\nThere is an inconsistency between the problem statement asking to derive an expression for LCOS(D) that includes $\\eta$, while the first-principles derivation based on the provided cost definitions does not naturally include it. However, Part 2 asks to minimize a function $G(D)$ that *does* include $\\eta$. This strongly implies that the denominator, Total Discharged Energy, should be defined differently or that LCOS itself is defined in a way that incorporates $\\eta$. A common alternative definition of LCOS includes efficiency in the denominator to represent the cost per unit of *useful* energy. Let's adopt the LCOS expression that aligns with Part 2. This implies a different denominator representing total useful work, where the throughput is penalized by inefficiency. The most plausible interpretation that makes the problem consistent is that the *effective total discharged energy* used for levelizing costs is $\\eta E_n D N(D)$. This normalizes the cost by the efficiency of the service.\nSo, let Total Service Delivered be $\\mathrm{TSD}(D) = \\eta E_{n} D N(D)$.\n$$ \\mathrm{LCOS}(D) = \\frac{\\mathrm{TLCC}(D)}{\\mathrm{TSD}(D)} = \\frac{K E_{n} + F E_{n} \\frac{N(D)}{\\nu} + c_{v} E_{n} D N(D)}{\\eta E_{n} D N(D)} $$\nWe simplify by dividing each numerator term by the denominator and canceling $E_n$:\n$$ \\mathrm{LCOS}(D) = \\frac{K}{\\eta D N(D)} + \\frac{F N(D)}{\\nu \\eta D N(D)} + \\frac{c_{v} D N(D)}{\\eta D N(D)} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{LCOS}(D) = \\frac{K}{\\eta D N(D)} + \\frac{F}{\\nu \\eta D} + \\frac{c_{v}}{\\eta} $$\nThis expression is consistent with the entire problem.\n\n### Part 2: Equivalence of Minimization and Role of $c_v$\n\nThe objective function to minimize is:\n$$ \\mathrm{LCOS}(D) = \\frac{K}{\\eta D N(D)} + \\frac{F}{\\nu \\eta D} + \\frac{c_{v}}{\\eta} $$\nThis expression is exactly the function $G(D)$ from the problem statement plus an additive constant, $\\frac{c_v}{\\eta}$.\n$$ \\mathrm{LCOS}(D) = G(D) + \\frac{c_{v}}{\\eta} $$\nTo find the value of $D$ that minimizes $\\mathrm{LCOS}(D)$, we are looking for $D^{\\star} = \\arg\\min_{D} \\mathrm{LCOS}(D)$. Since $c_v$ and $\\eta$ are constants with respect to $D$, the term $\\frac{c_v}{\\eta}$ is a constant. Adding a constant to a function shifts it vertically but does not change the location of its minimum. Therefore, minimizing $\\mathrm{LCOS}(D)$ is equivalent to minimizing $G(D)$.\n$$ \\arg\\min_{D} \\mathrm{LCOS}(D) = \\arg\\min_{D} \\left( G(D) + \\frac{c_{v}}{\\eta} \\right) = \\arg\\min_{D} G(D) $$\nThe variable cost $c_{v}$ does not affect the optimizer $D^{\\star}$ because it appears in an additive constant term in the objective function. When taking the derivative of $\\mathrm{LCOS}(D)$ with respect to $D$ and setting it to zero, the derivative of the constant term is zero, so $c_{v}$ drops out of the first-order condition.\n\n### Part 3: First-Order Necessary Condition\n\nTo derive the first-order necessary condition for an interior minimizer $D^{\\star} \\in (0,1)$, we set the derivative of the objective function $G(D)$ with respect to $D$ equal to zero.\n$$ G(D) = \\frac{K}{\\eta} (D N(D))^{-1} + \\frac{F}{\\nu \\eta} D^{-1} $$\nDifferentiating $G(D)$ with respect to $D$:\n$$ \\frac{dG}{dD} = \\frac{K}{\\eta} (-1)(D N(D))^{-2} \\frac{d}{dD}(D N(D)) + \\frac{F}{\\nu \\eta} (-1)D^{-2} $$\nThe derivative of the product $D N(D)$ is:\n$$ \\frac{d}{dD}(D N(D)) = 1 \\cdot N(D) + D \\cdot N^{\\prime}(D) = N(D) + D N^{\\prime}(D) $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\frac{dG}{dD}$:\n$$ \\frac{dG}{dD} = -\\frac{K}{\\eta} \\frac{N(D) + D N^{\\prime}(D)}{(D N(D))^2} - \\frac{F}{\\nu \\eta D^2} $$\nSetting the derivative to zero for an interior optimum $D^{\\star}$ and multiplying by $-\\eta D^2$:\n$$ K \\frac{N(D) + D N^{\\prime}(D)}{N(D)^2} + \\frac{F}{\\nu} = 0 $$\n$$ K \\left( \\frac{1}{N(D)} + \\frac{D N^{\\prime}(D)}{N(D)^2} \\right) + \\frac{F}{\\nu} = 0 $$\nTo obtain an interpretable form, we can rearrange:\n$$ \\frac{K D N^{\\prime}(D)}{N(D)^2} = - \\left( \\frac{K}{N(D)} + \\frac{F}{\\nu} \\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{D N^{\\prime}(D)}{N(D)} = -\\frac{N(D)}{K} \\left( \\frac{K}{N(D)} + \\frac{F}{\\nu} \\right) = -1 - \\frac{F N(D)}{\\nu K} $$\nThis gives the first-order condition:\n$$ 1 + \\frac{D N^{\\prime}(D)}{N(D)} = - \\frac{F N(D)}{\\nu K} $$\nThe term on the left, $1 + \\frac{D N^{\\prime}(D)}{N(D)}$, represents the elasticity of the total lifetime energy throughput, $D N(D)$, with respect to the depth of discharge $D$. The term $\\frac{D N^{\\prime}(D)}{N(D)}$ is the elasticity of cycle life with respect to $D$. The condition balances this elasticity against a ratio of fixed OM cost to capital cost, modulated by cycle frequency and life. At the optimum, the marginal gain in lifetime throughput from a deeper discharge is balanced by this cost ratio.\n\n### Part 4: Optimal DoD for Power-Law Cycle Life\n\nGiven the cycle-life model $N(D) = \\alpha D^{-\\beta}$, with $\\alpha  0$ and $\\beta  1$.\nFirst, we compute the derivative $N^{\\prime}(D)$:\n$$ N^{\\prime}(D) = \\frac{d}{dD}(\\alpha D^{-\\beta}) = -\\alpha \\beta D^{-\\beta-1} $$\nNext, we compute the elasticity term from the first-order condition:\n$$ \\frac{D N^{\\prime}(D)}{N(D)} = \\frac{D (-\\alpha \\beta D^{-\\beta-1})}{\\alpha D^{-\\beta}} = \\frac{-\\alpha \\beta D^{-\\beta}}{\\alpha D^{-\\beta}} = -\\beta $$\nNow, we substitute this result into the first-order condition derived in Part 3:\n$$ 1 + (-\\beta) = - \\frac{F N(D)}{\\nu K} $$\n$$ 1 - \\beta = - \\frac{F}{\\nu K}(\\alpha D^{-\\beta}) $$\nSince $\\beta  1$, the left side is non-zero. We can solve for $D$:\n$$ -(\\beta - 1) = - \\frac{F \\alpha}{\\nu K} D^{-\\beta} $$\n$$ \\beta - 1 = \\frac{F \\alpha}{\\nu K} D^{-\\beta} $$\nWe isolate the term with $D$:\n$$ D^{-\\beta} = \\frac{(\\beta - 1)\\nu K}{F \\alpha} $$\nTo solve for $D$, we take the reciprocal of both sides and then the $\\beta$-th root:\n$$ D^{\\beta} = \\frac{F \\alpha}{(\\beta - 1)\\nu K} $$\n$$ D^{\\star} = \\left( \\frac{F \\alpha}{\\nu K (\\beta - 1)} \\right)^{1/\\beta} $$\nThis is the closed-form expression for the optimal depth of discharge $D^{\\star}$. The problem statement provides the condition $0  D^{\\star} \\leq 1$, which ensures the solution is physically meaningful and lies within the admissible domain.",
