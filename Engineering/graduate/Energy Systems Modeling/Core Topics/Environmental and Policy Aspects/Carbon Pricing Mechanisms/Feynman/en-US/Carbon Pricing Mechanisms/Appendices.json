            "solution": "The problem is to minimize total abatement cost subject to a fixed aggregate abatement requirement. This setting captures the essence of cost-effective allocation under cap-and-trade: the shadow value of the constraint (the Lagrange multiplier) is the carbon price at which firms equate marginal abatement costs.\n\nWe start from fundamental optimization principles in microeconomics and energy systems modeling. The planner’s problem is\n$$\n\\min_{e_{1}, e_{2}} \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{2} b_{1} e_{1}^{2} + \\frac{1}{2} b_{2} e_{2}^{2} \\right\\} \\quad \\text{subject to} \\quad e_{1} + e_{2} = \\bar{E}, \\; e_{1} \\geq 0, \\; e_{2} \\geq 0,\n$$\nwith $b_{1} > 0$, $b_{2} > 0$, and $\\bar{E} > 0$.\n\nConstruct the Lagrangian with equality and inequality constraints. Let $\\lambda$ be the multiplier associated with the equality constraint $e_{1} + e_{2} - \\bar{E} = 0$. Let $\\mu_{1} \\geq 0$ and $\\mu_{2} \\geq 0$ be the multipliers for the nonnegativity constraints $-e_{1} \\leq 0$ and $-e_{2} \\leq 0$, respectively. The Lagrangian is\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}(e_{1}, e_{2}, \\lambda, \\mu_{1}, \\mu_{2}) = \\frac{1}{2} b_{1} e_{1}^{2} + \\frac{1}{2} b_{2} e_{2}^{2} + \\lambda \\left( e_{1} + e_{2} - \\bar{E} \\right) - \\mu_{1} e_{1} - \\mu_{2} e_{2}.\n$$\n\nThe Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions are:\n- Primal feasibility: $e_{1} \\geq 0$, $e_{2} \\geq 0$, and $e_{1} + e_{2} = \\bar{E}$.\n- Dual feasibility: $\\mu_{1} \\geq 0$, $\\mu_{2} \\geq 0$.\n- Stationarity: $\\nabla_{e_{1}} \\mathcal{L} = b_{1} e_{1} + \\lambda - \\mu_{1} = 0$, and $\\nabla_{e_{2}} \\mathcal{L} = b_{2} e_{2} + \\lambda - \\mu_{2} = 0$.\n- Complementary slackness: $\\mu_{1} e_{1} = 0$ and $\\mu_{2} e_{2} = 0$.\n\nBecause $\\bar{E} > 0$ and costs are strictly convex with $b_{i} > 0$, the cost-minimizing allocation will have strictly positive abatement at both firms, provided no firm has a zero marginal cost at positive abatement. Here, marginal costs are $b_{i} e_{i}$, which are strictly increasing in $e_{i}$ and zero only at $e_{i} = 0$. If either $e_{i} = 0$, the other firm must supply all $\\bar{E}$, but that would increase marginal costs at the other firm relative to sharing abatement across both. A formal check shows that an interior solution exists: suppose $e_{1} = 0$, then $e_{2} = \\bar{E}$ and the marginal cost at firm $2$ is $b_{2} \\bar{E}$. By continuity and convexity, allowing a small positive $e_{1}$ reduces total cost if $b_{1}$ is finite and positive. Symmetric reasoning applies to $e_{2} = 0$. Therefore, the optimal solution has $e_{1} > 0$ and $e_{2} > 0$, implying by complementary slackness that $\\mu_{1} = 0$ and $\\mu_{2} = 0$.\n\nWith $\\mu_{1} = \\mu_{2} = 0$, the stationarity conditions simplify to\n$$\nb_{1} e_{1} + \\lambda = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad b_{2} e_{2} + \\lambda = 0.\n$$\nThese imply\n$$\nb_{1} e_{1} = -\\lambda \\quad \\text{and} \\quad b_{2} e_{2} = -\\lambda.\n$$\nSince $e_{i} \\geq 0$, the Lagrange multiplier associated with the equality constraint must be nonpositive in this sign convention. To align with the interpretation of $\\lambda$ as a positive shadow price (carbon price), we adopt the equivalent Lagrangian sign convention that places the multiplier on the constraint as $-\\lambda ( e_{1} + e_{2} - \\bar{E} )$, yielding stationarity conditions $b_{i} e_{i} - \\lambda - \\mu_{i} = 0$. This amounts to redefining $\\lambda$ with opposite sign, which is innocuous for the solution and makes $\\lambda$ equal to the marginal cost at the optimum, as is standard in energy systems modeling.\n\nUsing the positive-price convention, set the Lagrangian\n$$\n\\tilde{\\mathcal{L}}(e_{1}, e_{2}, \\lambda, \\mu_{1}, \\mu_{2}) = \\frac{1}{2} b_{1} e_{1}^{2} + \\frac{1}{2} b_{2} e_{2}^{2} - \\lambda \\left( e_{1} + e_{2} - \\bar{E} \\right) - \\mu_{1} e_{1} - \\mu_{2} e_{2},\n$$\nso stationarity gives\n$$\nb_{1} e_{1} - \\lambda - \\mu_{1} = 0, \\quad b_{2} e_{2} - \\lambda - \\mu_{2} = 0.\n$$\nWith the interior solution $\\mu_{1} = \\mu_{2} = 0$, we have\n$$\nb_{1} e_{1} = \\lambda, \\quad b_{2} e_{2} = \\lambda.\n$$\nThus,\n$$\ne_{1} = \\frac{\\lambda}{b_{1}}, \\quad e_{2} = \\frac{\\lambda}{b_{2}}.\n$$\nImpose the equality constraint $e_{1} + e_{2} = \\bar{E}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\lambda}{b_{1}} + \\frac{\\lambda}{b_{2}} = \\bar{E} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad \\lambda \\left( \\frac{1}{b_{1}} + \\frac{1}{b_{2}} \\right) = \\bar{E}.\n$$\nSolve for $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{\\bar{E}}{\\frac{1}{b_{1}} + \\frac{1}{b_{2}}} = \\bar{E} \\cdot \\frac{b_{1} b_{2}}{b_{1} + b_{2}}.\n$$\nSubstitute back to obtain $e_{1}$ and $e_{2}$:\n$$\ne_{1} = \\frac{\\lambda}{b_{1}} = \\bar{E} \\cdot \\frac{b_{2}}{b_{1} + b_{2}}, \\quad e_{2} = \\frac{\\lambda}{b_{2}} = \\bar{E} \\cdot \\frac{b_{1}}{b_{1} + b_{2}}.\n$$\n\nThese expressions satisfy primal feasibility ($e_{1}, e_{2} > 0$ and sum to $\\bar{E}$), stationarity, and complementary slackness with $\\mu_{1} = \\mu_{2} = 0$. Because the objective is strictly convex and the feasible set is affine, the KKT conditions are sufficient, and this solution is unique. The shadow price $\\lambda$ equals the common marginal abatement cost across firms at the optimum, which is the equilibrium carbon price in a competitive cap-and-trade market.\n\nTherefore, the closed-form solution is\n$$\n\\lambda = \\bar{E} \\cdot \\frac{b_{1} b_{2}}{b_{1} + b_{2}}, \\quad e_{1} = \\bar{E} \\cdot \\frac{b_{2}}{b_{1} + b_{2}}, \\quad e_{2} = \\bar{E} \\cdot \\frac{b_{1}}{b_{1} + b_{2}}.\n$$",

            "problem": "An energy systems model must aggregate discrete greenhouse gas mitigation opportunities into a system-wide Marginal Abatement Cost (MAC) curve to support policy design under a carbon price. The Marginal Abatement Cost (MAC) is defined as the incremental monetary cost per unit of emissions reduction required to achieve an additional unit of abatement at a given level of cumulative abatement. Under a carbon price signal $p_C$ (United States Dollar per metric ton of Carbon Dioxide (USD/tCO$_2$)), economic agents undertake all abatement actions whose internal marginal cost of reduction is less than or equal to $p_C$. \n\nConsider a set of $5$ discrete abatement options $j \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ with maximum potential annual reductions $\\Delta e_j$ (million metric tons of Carbon Dioxide per year, MtCO$_2$/year) and option-wide maximum marginal costs $c_j$ (USD/tCO$_2$) given by:\n- Industrial process optimization: $\\Delta e_1 = 4$, $c_1 = 20$.\n- Power sector fuel switching: $\\Delta e_2 = 9$, $c_2 = 35$.\n- Building retrofits: $\\Delta e_3 = 7$, $c_3 = 60$.\n- Transportation electrification: $\\Delta e_4 = 12$, $c_4 = 100$.\n- Methane leak detection and repair: $\\Delta e_5 = 5$, $c_5 = 15$.\n\nAssume within each option $j$ there exists a continuum of micro-measures with heterogeneous marginal costs that are uniformly distributed from $0$ up to $c_j$ over the option’s capacity $\\Delta e_j$.

            "solution": "The problem requires us to determine the total annual abatement of greenhouse gases for a given carbon price, based on a set of discrete abatement options, each with an internal continuum of project costs.\n\nFirst, we must formalize the relationship between carbon price and the abatement realized from a single option $j$. The problem states that for each option $j$, characterized by a maximum abatement potential $\\Delta e_j$ and a maximum marginal cost $c_j$, the marginal costs of its constituent micro-measures are uniformly distributed from $0$ to $c_j$. This is specified as \"the share of $\\Delta e_j$ whose marginal cost does not exceed a threshold $m$ is proportional to $m$ on the interval $[0,c_j]$\".\n\nLet this share be denoted by $S_j(m)$. The proportionality implies $S_j(m) = k_j m$ for some constant $k_j$ and for $m \\in [0, c_j]$. At the maximum marginal cost $m = c_j$, all micro-measures are included, so the share is $1$. Thus, $S_j(c_j) = k_j c_j = 1$, which gives $k_j = 1/c_j$. The share of abatement potential with marginal cost not exceeding $m$ is therefore $S_j(m) = m/c_j$ for $m \\in [0, c_j]$. For any cost threshold $m > c_j$, the share remains $1$.\n\nAccording to the economic principle given, under a carbon price $p_C$, all abatement actions with a marginal cost less than or equal to $p_C$ will be undertaken. Therefore, the abatement realized from option $j$, denoted as $a_j(p_C)$, is the total potential $\\Delta e_j$ multiplied by the share of measures with cost up to $p_C$. This can be expressed as:\n- If $0 \\le p_C \\le c_j$, the realized abatement is $a_j(p_C) = \\Delta e_j \\cdot S_j(p_C) = \\Delta e_j \\frac{p_C}{c_j}$.\n- If $p_C > c_j$, all possible abatement for this option is realized, so $a_j(p_C) = \\Delta e_j$.\n\nThis can be concisely written as $a_j(p_C) = \\Delta e_j \\cdot \\min\\left(1, \\frac{p_C}{c_j}\\right)$.\n\nThe aggregate abatement supply curve, which provides the total abatement $A(p_C)$ as a function of the carbon price $p_C$, is the sum of the abatements from all individual options.\n$$A(p_C) = \\sum_{j=1}^{5} a_j(p_C)$$\nThis function $A(p_C)$ represents the aggregate supply of abatement. The MAC curve is technically the inverse function, $p_C(A)$, which gives the marginal cost for the last unit of abatement at a cumulative level $A$.

Offsets are accepted at face value for compliance, but only a fraction $q \\in (0,1)$ of each offset represents a real emissions reduction (offset integrity). Firms choose abatement until the market allowance price $p$ (in United States Dollar per metric ton of carbon dioxide, USD/tCO$_2$) equals their marginal abatement cost.

            "solution": "The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and internally consistent. It describes a standard economic model of a cap-and-trade system with imperfect offsets. All necessary parameters and functional forms are provided for a unique solution. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nFirst, we establish the market-clearing condition for the allowance price, $p$. In a cap-and-trade system, the total quantity of emissions reductions required to bring baseline emissions $E_{b}$ down to the level of the cap $C$ is $E_{b} - C$. This total reduction is achieved through two mechanisms: domestic abatement, $A(p)$, and the purchase of offsets, $S_{o}(p)$. The market for compliance instruments clears when the sum of abatement and offsets equals the required reduction. This gives the equilibrium condition that determines the price $p$:\n$$A(p) + S_{o}(p) = E_{b} - C$$\nThis equation implicitly defines the market allowance price $p$.\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the actual, or real, emissions of the regulated sector, $E_{\\mathrm{real}}$. Real emissions are the baseline emissions $E_{b}$ minus all real emissions reductions. Domestic abatement $A(p)$ is considered a real reduction. However, offsets have an integrity factor $q$, meaning that for each offset purchased (representing $1$ tonne of CO$_2$), only a fraction $q$ corresponds to a real, verifiable emissions reduction. Thus, the total real reduction from using $S_{o}(p)$ offsets is $q \\cdot S_{o}(p)$.\nThe total real emissions reduction is the sum of domestic abatement and the real portion of offsets: $A(p) + q \\cdot S_{o}(p)$.\nTherefore, the real emissions are:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{real}} = E_{b} - \\left( A(p) + q \\cdot S_{o}(p) \\right)$$\n\nThe problem asks for the increase in real emissions relative to the cap, defined as $\\Delta C_{\\mathrm{eff}} = E_{\\mathrm{real}} - C$. Substituting the expression for $E_{\\mathrm{real}}$:\n$$\\Delta C_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\left( E_{b} - A(p) - q \\cdot S_{o}(p) \\right) - C$$\nRearranging the terms gives:\n$$\\Delta C_{\\mathrm{eff}} = (E_{b} - C) - A(p) - q \\cdot S_{o}(p)$$\nNow, we substitute the market-clearing condition, $E_{b} - C = A(p) + S_{o}(p)$, into this expression:\n$$\\Delta C_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\left( A(p) + S_{o}(p) \\right) - A(p) - q \\cdot S_{o}(p)$$\n$$ \\Delta C_{\\mathrm{eff}} = S_{o}(p) - q \\cdot S_{o}(p)$$\nThis simplifies to the expression for the shift in the effective cap, or the surplus emissions due to low-quality offsets:\n$$\\Delta C_{\\mathrm{eff}} = (1-q) S_{o}(p)$$\nThis shows that the increase in real emissions above the cap is equal to the quantity of offsets purchased multiplied by the fraction of each offset that does not represent a real emission reduction, $(1-q)$.\n\nNow, we use the provided numerical parameters to calculate the value of $\\Delta C_{\\mathrm{eff}}$.\nGiven:\n$E_{b} = 120$ MtCO$_2$\n$C = 80$ MtCO$_2$\n$A(p) = 0.5\\,p + 0.02\\,p^{2}$\n$S_{o}(p) = 0.3\\,p$\n$q = 0.4$\n\nFirst, we solve for the market price $p$ using the market-clearing condition:\n$$A(p) + S_{o}(p) = E_{b} - C$$\n$$(0.5\\,p + 0.02\\,p^{2}) + (0.3\\,p) = 120 - 80$$\n$$0.02\\,p^{2} + 0.8\\,p = 40$$\n$$0.02\\,p^{2} + 0.8\\,p - 40 = 0$$\nTo simplify, we can multiply the entire equation by $50$:\n$$p^{2} + 40\\,p - 2000 = 0$$\nWe solve this quadratic equation for $p$ using the quadratic formula, $p = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, with $a=1$, $b=40$, and $c=-2000$.\n$$p = \\frac{-40 \\pm \\sqrt{40^{2} - 4(1)(-2000)}}{2(1)}$$\n$$p = \\frac{-40 \\pm \\sqrt{1600 + 8000}}{2}$$\n$$p = \\frac{-40 \\pm \\sqrt{9600}}{2}$$\nTo simplify the radical, $\\sqrt{9600} = \\sqrt{1600 \\times 6} = 40\\sqrt{6}$.\n$$p = \\frac{-40 \\pm 40\\sqrt{6}}{2} = -20 \\pm 20\\sqrt{6}$$\nSince the price $p$ must be a positive value, we take the positive root:\n$$p = -20 + 20\\sqrt{6} = 20(\\sqrt{6} - 1)$$\n\nFinally, we compute the increase in real emissions, $\\Delta C_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, using the derived formula $\\Delta C_{\\mathrm{eff}} = (1-q) S_{o}(p)$.\nWe have $1-q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6$.
