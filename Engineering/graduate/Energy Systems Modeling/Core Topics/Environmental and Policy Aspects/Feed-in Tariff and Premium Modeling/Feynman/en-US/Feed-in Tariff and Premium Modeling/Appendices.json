We will model how a FIT program is financed through a per-unit levy on consumer electricity bills and derive the precise impact this has on consumer surplus. This exercise provides a foundational tool for evaluating the welfare effects of renewable energy policies from the perspective of the end-user. ",

            "problem": "Consider a single-period, perfectly competitive retail electricity market with a representative inverse demand that can be written equivalently as a direct demand function $Q(p) = a - bp$, where $a > 0$ and $b > 0$. Consumers face a retail price that equals a baseline component $p_0$ (which aggregates marginal energy, network, and other non-policy charges) plus a per-kilowatt-hour levy $\\ell \\ge 0$. A policy-maker operates a feed-in tariff (FIT) program that guarantees renewable generators a fixed tariff $F$ per kilowatt-hour for an exogenously given, perfectly inelastic renewable quantity $Q_R > 0$ in the period. The market value that the system operator receives for this renewable energy is $p_w$ per kilowatt-hour, where $F \\ge p_w$. The FIT budget in the period is financed entirely by the levy $\\ell$ applied to each kilowatt-hour of total retail consumption, with full and immediate pass-through of $\\ell$ into the retail price. There is no external financing, borrowing, or surplus retention; the FIT account must exactly balance in the period. Assume the feasibility condition that ensures an interior solution: $(a - b p_0)^{2} - 4b(F - p_w)Q_R \\ge 0$.\n\nTasks:\n- Using only the definitions of demand, budget balance, and consumer surplus, write the government budget constraint that determines $\\ell$ endogenously under the FIT. Solve this condition for the levy $\\ell$ as a function of $a$, $b$, $p_0$, $F$, $p_w$, and $Q_R$, selecting the economically relevant root that is consistent with $\\ell \\to 0$ as $(F - p_w)Q_R \\to 0$.\n- Taking the no-policy baseline to be $\\ell = 0$ with retail price $p_0$ and consumption $Q_0 = a - b p_0$, derive the exact closed-form expression for the change in consumer surplus $\\Delta CS$ when the levy is passed through, relative to this baseline. Express your final result solely in terms of $a$, $b$, $p_0$, $F$, $p_w$, and $Q_R$.\n\nAnswer format:\n- Provide the final answer as a single closed-form analytic expression for $\\Delta CS$.\n- Express the change in consumer surplus in currency units per period.\n- No numerical evaluation is required and no rounding should be applied.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the levy $\\ell$ that finances a feed-in tariff (FIT) program and the resulting change in consumer surplus, $\\Delta CS$. The problem is well-posed and scientifically sound, based on standard microeconomic principles applied to energy markets.\n\nThe first step is to establish the government's budget constraint for the FIT program. The program guarantees a tariff $F$ for a quantity of renewable generation $Q_R$. The market value of this energy is $p_w$ per unit. The net cost of the program is the total tariff payment minus the revenue received from selling the energy at the market value. This cost is entirely financed by a levy $\\ell$ on total retail consumption $Q$. The budget must balance exactly.\n\nTotal FIT Cost = $(F - p_w)Q_R$.\nThe retail price paid by consumers is $p = p_0 + \\ell$, where $p_0$ is the baseline price component and $\\ell$ is the levy.\nTotal consumption $Q$ is determined by the demand function at this price: $Q(p) = a - bp = a - b(p_0 + \\ell)$.\nTotal revenue from the levy is $R = \\ell \\times Q = \\ell [a - b(p_0 + \\ell)]$.\n\nThe budget balance constraint is Total Revenue = Total FIT Cost:\n$$ \\ell [a - b(p_0 + \\ell)] = (F - p_w)Q_R $$\nExpanding and rearranging this equation gives a quadratic equation for $\\ell$:\n$$ a\\ell - b p_0\\ell - b\\ell^2 = (F - p_w)Q_R $$\n$$ b\\ell^2 + (b p_0 - a)\\ell + (F - p_w)Q_R = 0 $$\n$$ b\\ell^2 - (a - b p_0)\\ell + (F - p_w)Q_R = 0 $$\nThis equation determines the levy $\\ell$ endogenously.\n\nTo solve for $\\ell$, we use the quadratic formula:\n$$ \\ell = \\frac{-[-(a - b p_0)] \\pm \\sqrt{[-(a - b p_0)]^2 - 4b(F - p_w)Q_R}}{2b} $$\n$$ \\ell = \\frac{a - b p_0 \\pm \\sqrt{(a - b p_0)^2 - 4b(F - p_w)Q_R}}{2b} $$\nThe problem provides the feasibility condition $(a - b p_0)^{2} - 4b(F - p_w)Q_R \\ge 0$, which ensures the discriminant is non-negative and the solutions for $\\ell$ are real.\n\nWe must select the economically relevant root, which is consistent with the condition that $\\ell \\to 0$ as the net FIT cost, $(F - p_w)Q_R$, approaches $0$.\nLet's analyze the behavior of the two roots as $(F - p_w)Q_R \\to 0$:\n$$ \\ell \\to \\frac{a - b p_0 \\pm \\sqrt{(a - b p_0)^2}}{2b} $$\nSince $Q_0 = a - b p_0$ represents baseline consumption, it must be non-negative, so $\\sqrt{(a-b p_0)^2} = a - b p_0$.\nThe two possible limits are:\n$1$. With the '$+$' sign: $\\ell \\to \\frac{(a - b p_0) + (a - b p_0)}{2b} = \\frac{2(a - b p_0)}{2b} = \\frac{a}{b} - p_0$. This is generally not zero.\n$2$. With the '$-$' sign: $\\ell \\to \\frac{(a - b p_0) - (a - b p_0)}{2b} = \\frac{0}{2b} = 0$. This root is consistent with the physical expectation that a zero-cost policy should result in a zero levy.\nTherefore, the correct expression for the levy is:\n$$ \\ell = \\frac{a - b p_0 - \\sqrt{(a - b p_0)^2 - 4b(F - p_w)Q_R}}{2b} $$\nThis completes the first task.\n\nThe second task is to find the change in consumer surplus, $\\Delta CS$. Consumer surplus ($CS$) for a linear demand curve $Q(p) = a - bp$ is the area of a triangle given by $CS(p) = \\frac{1}{2b}(a - bp)^2$.\nThe baseline state corresponds to $\\ell=0$, so the price is $p_0$. The baseline consumer surplus is:\n$$ CS_0 = CS(p_0) = \\frac{1}{2b}(a - b p_0)^2 $$\nWith the FIT policy, the price is $p_1 = p_0 + \\ell$. The new consumer surplus is:\n$$ CS_1 = CS(p_1) = \\frac{1}{2b}(a - b p_1)^2 = \\frac{1}{2b}(a - b(p_0 + \\ell))^2 $$\nThe change in consumer surplus is $\\Delta CS = CS_1 - CS_0$:\n$$ \\Delta CS = \\frac{1}{2b}(a - b(p_0 + \\ell))^2 - \\frac{1}{2b}(a - b p_0)^2 $$\n$$ \\Delta CS = \\frac{1}{2b} \\left[ (a - b p_0 - b\\ell)^2 - (a - b p_0)^2 \\right] $$\nExpanding the terms inside the brackets:\n$$ \\Delta CS = \\frac{1}{2b} \\left[ ((a - b p_0)^2 - 2b\\ell(a - b p_0) + b^2\\ell^2) - (a - b p_0)^2 \\right] $$\n$$ \\Delta CS = \\frac{1}{2b} [-2b\\ell(a - b p_0) + b^2\\ell^2] = -\\ell(a - b p_0) + \\frac{b}{2}\\ell^2 $$\n$$ \\Delta CS = \\frac{b}{2}\\ell^2 - (a-b p_0)\\ell $$\nTo simplify this, we can use the quadratic equation derived from the budget constraint: $b\\ell^2 - (a - b p_0)\\ell + (F - p_w)Q_R = 0$. From this, we have $b\\ell^2 - (a - b p_0)\\ell = -(F - p_w)Q_R$.\nWe can rewrite $\\Delta CS$ as:\n$$ \\Delta CS = \\frac{1}{2}[b\\ell^2 - 2(a-b p_0)\\ell] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( [b\\ell^2 - (a-b p_0)\\ell] - (a-b p_0)\\ell \\right) $$\nSubstituting the expression from the budget constraint:\n$$ \\Delta CS = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( -(F - p_w)Q_R - (a-b p_0)\\ell \\right) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\left( (F - p_w)Q_R + (a-b p_0)\\ell \\right) $$\nFinally, we substitute the expression for $\\ell$ into this equation for $\\Delta CS$ to express it solely in terms of the fundamental parameters:\n$$ \\Delta CS = -\\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (F - p_w)Q_R + (a-b p_0) \\left( \\frac{a - b p_0 - \\sqrt{(a - b p_0)^2 - 4b(F - p_w)Q_R}}{2b} \\right) \\right] $$\nThis can be written in its final form:\n$$ \\Delta CS = -\\frac{1}{2}(F - p_w)Q_R - \\frac{(a-b p_0)^2 - (a-b p_0)\\sqrt{(a - b p_0)^2 - 4b(F - p_w)Q_R}}{4b} $$\nCombining into a single fraction:\n$$ \\Delta CS = - \\frac{2b(F - p_w)Q_R + (a-b p_0)^2 - (a-b p_0)\\sqrt{(a - b p_0)^2 - 4b(F - p_w)Q_R}}{4b} $$\nThe form requested in the problem statement contains $\\ell$ explicitly, so the version just prior to this final combination is also fully compliant. The first part of the expression inside the brackets is a transfer, while the second part is the deadweight loss.\nLet's stick to the slightly more expanded but clearer form:\n$$ \\Delta CS = -\\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (F - p_w)Q_R + \\frac{(a-b p_0)^2 - (a-b p_0)\\sqrt{(a - b p_0)^2 - 4b(F - p_w)Q_R}}{2b} \\right] $$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the change in consumer surplus.",
