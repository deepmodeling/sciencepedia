            "problem": "You are asked to model the removal rate in Chemical–Mechanical Planarization (CMP) from first principles consistent with Semiconductor Manufacturing Process Modeling. Begin from the empirical Preston regime, which asserts that material removal in CMP scales with the frictional contact work rate at the pad–wafer interface. Treat the measured removal rate $RR$ in $\\mathrm{nm/min}$ as a linear response to the scalar regressor given by the product of applied downforce $P$ in $\\mathrm{kPa}$ and relative velocity $V$ in $\\mathrm{m/s}$, and then consider the possibility that deviations from the linear regime occur at elevated $P$ or $V$. Assume additive measurement noise that is independent and identically distributed, and use Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), which is defined by minimizing the sum of squared residuals, to estimate model parameters and quantify uncertainty with confidence intervals formed under a standard normal-error linear model.\n\nTask specification:\n- For each dataset, construct a design with a single regressor $x_i$ equal to the product $P_i V_i$, and fit a one-parameter linear model for $RR_i$ using OLS without an intercept. Compute the parameter estimate and its $95$ percent confidence interval using the Student’s $t$ distribution.\n- For each dataset, augment the model with quadratic terms in $P$ and $V$ as additional regressors to test for deviations from linearity at elevated $P$ or $V$. Fit the three-parameter model (no intercept) using OLS. Compute $95$ percent confidence intervals for each parameter. Then perform two-sided significance tests for the quadratic parameters using the Student’s $t$ distribution at level $0.05$ to decide whether deviations from linearity are present.\n- Units: express the linear coefficient for the single-regressor model in $(\\mathrm{nm/min})/(\\mathrm{kPa\\cdot m/s})$. In the augmented model, express the coefficient of the product regressor in $(\\mathrm{nm/min})/(\\mathrm{kPa\\cdot m/s})$, the coefficient of the quadratic pressure regressor in $(\\mathrm{nm/min})/(\\mathrm{kPa}^2)$, and the coefficient of the quadratic velocity regressor in $(\\mathrm{nm/min})/(\\mathrm{(m/s)}^2)$.

            "solution": "The problem requires us to model the material removal rate ($RR$) in a Chemical–Mechanical Planarization (CMP) process using linear regression. We are given three datasets, each containing measurements of applied downforce ($P$), relative velocity ($V$), and the resulting removal rate ($RR$). The analysis is performed in two stages for each dataset.\n\nFirst, we fit a simple linear model based on Preston's equation, which posits that the removal rate is proportional to the mechanical work rate, represented by the product of pressure and velocity. This gives a single-regressor model with no intercept.\nSecond, we fit an augmented model that includes quadratic terms in pressure ($P^2$) and velocity ($V^2$) to test for non-linear behavior, which can occur at higher process parameters. This is a multiple linear regression model with three regressors and no intercept.\n\nFor both models, the parameters are estimated using the method of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). We will also compute $95\\%$ confidence intervals for the estimated parameters and perform hypothesis tests on the coefficients of the quadratic terms to check for statistically significant deviations from the simple Preston model.\n\nThe general framework for Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression for a model of the form $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$, where $\\mathbf{y}$ is an $n \\times 1$ vector of observations, $\\mathbf{X}$ is an $n \\times p$ design matrix of rank $p$, $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ is a $p \\times 1$ vector of unknown parameters, and $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$ is an $n \\times 1$ vector of unobserved random errors, is to find the parameter vector $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$ that minimizes the sum of squared residuals ($SSR$).\n$$SSR = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} e_i^2 = \\mathbf{e}^T\\mathbf{e} = (\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta})^T (\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta})$$\nThe OLS estimator for $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$ is found by solving $\\frac{\\partial(SSR)}{\\partial \\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = 0$, which yields the normal equations $\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X}\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{y}$. The solution is:\n$$\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = (\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{y}$$\n\nAssuming the errors $\\epsilon_i$ are independent and identically distributed with a normal distribution $N(0, \\sigma^2)$, the estimator $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$ is also normally distributed. The unknown error variance $\\sigma^2$ is estimated by the sample variance:\n$$\\hat{\\sigma}^2 = \\frac{\\mathbf{e}^T\\mathbf{e}}{n-p} = \\frac{(\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X}\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}})^T(\\mathbf{y} - \\mathbf{X}\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}})}{df}$$\nwhere $df = n-p$ are the degrees of freedom.\n\nThe covariance matrix of the parameter estimates is given by:\n$$Cov(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}) = \\hat{\\sigma}^2 (\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}$$\nThe standard error for a specific parameter estimate $\\hat{\\beta}_j$ is the square root of the $j$-th diagonal element of this covariance matrix, $se(\\hat{\\beta}_j) = \\sqrt{Cov(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}})_{jj}}$.\n\nA $(1-\\alpha) \\times 100\\%$ confidence interval for a parameter $\\beta_j$ is constructed using the Student's $t$-distribution:\n$$\\hat{\\beta}_j \\pm t_{1-\\alpha/2, df} \\cdot se(\\hat{\\beta}_j)$$\nwhere $t_{1-\\alpha/2, df}$ is the critical value from the $t$-distribution with $df$ degrees of freedom for a cumulative probability of $1-\\alpha/2$. For this problem, we use a $95\\%$ confidence level, so $\\alpha=0.05$.\n\nA two-sided significance test for the null hypothesis $H_0: \\beta_j = 0$ is performed by computing the t-statistic $t_{stat} = \\hat{\\beta}_j / se(\\hat{\\beta}_j)$. The null hypothesis is rejected at significance level $\\alpha$ if $|t_{stat}| > t_{1-\\alpha/2, df}$, which is equivalent to the condition that the $(1-\\alpha)$ confidence interval for $\\beta_j$ does not contain $0$.\n\n**Model 1: Single-Regressor (Preston) Model**\n\nThe model is $RR_i = \\beta (P_i V_i) + \\epsilon_i$.\nHere, the response is $y_i = RR_i$ and the single regressor is $x_i = P_i V_i$.\nThe number of parameters is $p=1$. The degrees of freedom are $df = n-1 = 12-1=11$.\nThe design matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ is an $n \\times 1$ column vector of the $x_i$ values.\nThe OLS estimate $\\hat{\\beta}$ simplifies from the matrix form to:\n$$\\hat{\\beta} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2}$$\nThe variance of the estimate is $Var(\\hat{\\beta}) = \\hat{\\sigma}^2 / (\\sum x_i^2)$, and its standard error is the square root of this value. The $95\\%$ confidence interval is then computed using the critical value $t_{0.975, 11}$.\n\n**Model 2: Augmented Three-Regressor Model**\n\nThe model is $RR_i = \\beta_1 (P_i V_i) + \\beta_2 (P_i^2) + \\beta_3 (V_i^2) + \\epsilon_i$.\nThe response is $y_i = RR_i$. The regressors are $x_{i1} = P_i V_i$, $x_{i2} = P_i^2$, and $x_{i3} = V_i^2$.\nThe number of parameters is $p=3$. The degrees of freedom are $df = n-3 = 12-3=9$.\nThe design matrix $\\mathbf{X}$ is an $n \\times 3$ matrix where the columns are the vectors of $x_{i1}$, $x_{i2}$, and $x_{i3}$.\nThe parameter vector estimate $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = [\\hat{\\beta}_1, \\hat{\\beta}_2, \\hat{\\beta}_3]^T$ is computed using the full matrix formula $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}} = (\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{y}$.\nConfidence intervals for each $\\hat{\\beta}_j$ are calculated using their respective standard errors (from the diagonal of the covariance matrix) and the critical value $t_{0.975, 9}$.\n\n**Deviation Decision**\nThe deviation flag is set to $1$ if the null hypothesis $H_0: \\beta_2 = 0$ or $H_0: \\beta_3 = 0$ is rejected at the $\\alpha=0.05$ significance level. This means the flag is $1$ if the $95\\%$ confidence interval for $\\beta_2$ does not contain $0$, or if the $95\\%$ confidence interval for $\\beta_3$ does not contain $0$. Otherwise, the flag is $0$.\n\nThe following steps are applied consistently to each of the three provided datasets.",

The height profile is then $h(x,t) = H(t)\\sin(k_x x)$.\n\nFirst, we determine the time and space derivatives of $h(x,t)$:\nThe time derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\left[H(t)\\sin(k_x x)\\right] = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}H(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\sin(k_x x)\n$$\nThe second spatial derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x} = H(t) k_x \\cos(k_x x)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2}h}{\\partial x^{2}} = -H(t) k_x^{2} \\sin(k_x x) = -k_x^2 h(x,t)\n$$\n\nNext, we use the given Helmholtz-type relation to find the pressure perturbation $\\delta p(x,t)$ corresponding to the height profile $h(x,t)$.\n$$\n\\left(1 - L^{2}\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial x^{2}}\\right)\\delta p(x,t) = S\\left(-\\frac{\\partial^{2} h(x,t)}{\\partial x^{2}}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the second derivative of $h(x,t)$:\n$$\n\\left(1 - L^{2}\\frac{\\partial^{2}}{\\partial x^{2}}\\right)\\delta p(x,t) = S\\left(-(-k_x^2 h(x,t))\\right) = S k_x^2 h(x,t)\n$$\nSince the right-hand side is sinusoidal in $x$, the pressure perturbation $\\delta p(x,t)$ must also be sinusoidal with the same wavenumber, i.e., $\\delta p(x,t) \\propto \\sin(k_x x)$. For such a function, the operator $\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}$ is equivalent to multiplication by $-k_x^2$. Applying this to $\\delta p(x,t)$:\n$$\n\\left(1 - L^{2}(-k_x^2)\\right)\\delta p(x,t) = S k_x^2 h(x,t)\n$$\n$$\n(1 + L^{2}k_x^2)\\delta p(x,t) = S k_x^2 h(x,t)\n$$\nSolving for $\\delta p(x,t)$ in terms of $h(x,t)$:\n$$\n\\delta p(x,t) = \\frac{S k_x^2}{1 + L^{2}k_x^2} h(x,t)\n$$\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $\\delta p(x,t)$ into the height evolution equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t} = -k V \\delta p(x,t)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t} = -k V \\left(\\frac{S k_x^2}{1 + L^{2}k_x^2}\\right) h(x,t)\n$$\nSubstitute the expressions for $\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t}$ and $h(x,t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}H(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t}\\sin(k_x x) = -k V \\left(\\frac{S k_x^2}{1 + L^{2}k_x^2}\\right) H(t)\\sin(k_x x)\n$$\nFor this equation to hold for all $x$, we can cancel the term $\\sin(k_x x)$ (for $x$ where it is non-zero), which yields an ordinary differential equation for the amplitude $H(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}H(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k V \\left(\\frac{S k_x^2}{1 + L^{2}k_x^2}\\right) H(t)\n$$\nTo find the fractional decay rate, we divide by $H(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{H(t)}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}H(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = -k V \\frac{S k_x^2}{1 + L^{2}k_x^2}\n$$\nThe quantity needed for the efficiency $\\eta$ is $-\\frac{1}{H}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}H}{\\mathrm{d}t}$:\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{H(t)}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}H(t)}{\\mathrm{d}t} = k V \\frac{S k_x^2}{1 + L^{2}k_x^2}\n$$\n\nFinally, we substitute this result into the definition of $\\eta$:\n$$\n\\eta = \\frac{-\\frac{1}{H}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}H}{\\mathrm{d}t}}{k P_{0} V} = \\frac{k V \\frac{S k_x^2}{1 + L^{2}k_x^2}}{k P_{0} V}\n$$\nThe terms $k$ and $V$ cancel, leaving:\n$$\n\\eta = \\frac{S}{P_0} \\frac{k_x^2}{1 + L^2 k_x^2}\n$$\nTo express this in terms of the given parameters $\\lambda$ and $L$, we substitute $k_x = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}$:\n$$\n\\eta = \\frac{S}{P_0} \\frac{\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\right)^2}{1 + L^2 \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\right)^2}\n$$\nTo obtain a more elegant form, we can divide the numerator and the denominator by $k_x^2 = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\right)^2$:\n$$\n\\eta = \\frac{S}{P_0} \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{k_x^2} + L^2} = \\frac{S}{P_0} \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{2\\pi}\\right)^2 + L^2}\n$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for $\\eta$.\n\nWe can now analyze the asymptotic scaling as requested.\n1.  For long wavelengths, $\\lambda \\gg L$: In this limit, $\\frac{\\lambda}{2\\pi} \\gg L$, so the denominator is dominated by the wavelength-dependent term: $\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{2\\pi}\\right)^2 + L^2 \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{2\\pi}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\lambda^2}{4\\pi^2}$.\n    The efficiency becomes $\\eta \\approx \\frac{S}{P_0} \\frac{4\\pi^2}{\\lambda^2}$. The scaling is $\\eta \\propto \\lambda^{-2}$. Planarization is very inefficient for very long wavelengths.\n2.  For short wavelengths, $\\lambda \\ll L$: In this limit, $\\frac{\\lambda}{2\\pi} \\ll L$, so the denominator is dominated by the constant term: $\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{2\\pi}\\right)^2 + L^2 \\approx L^2$.\n    The efficiency becomes $\\eta \\approx \\frac{S}{P_0 L^2}$. The efficiency saturates to a constant value, independent of wavelength. The scaling is $\\eta \\propto \\lambda^0$.\n\nThe final answer required is the single closed-form analytic expression for $\\eta(\\lambda)$.",

It is based on established, albeit simplified, models of Chemical–Mechanical Planarization (CMP) such as Preston's equation and first-order reaction kinetics.

The problem is a formalizable exercise in applying integral calculus to a physical rate equation to determine process constraints, which is a standard task in process engineering.
