These concepts are fundamental in surface science and are directly applicable to the modeling of stiction phenomena in semiconductor manufacturing and MEMS. The assumptions, such as neglecting gravity (justified by the small Bond number at nanoscale) and modeling the meniscus as a cylindrical segment, are standard and physically reasonable simplifications for this context.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is clearly defined with all necessary parameters ($H, L, g, \\gamma, \\theta$) provided for deriving a unique expression for the force under the given model. The objective is explicit. The term \"maximum\" tensile force is interpreted as the force occurring when the liquid bridge spans the full height $H$ and length $L$ of the structures, as no other variable parameter is available to maximize over.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated using precise, quantitative, and unbiased scientific language.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, missing information, or ambiguity. It is a well-posed physics problem.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the tensile force exerted by a liquid bridge on two parallel walls, starting from the principle that this force is the product of the Laplace pressure and the wetted area.\n\nFirst, we determine the Laplace pressure, $\\Delta P$, which is the pressure difference across the curved liquid-vapor interface. The Young-Laplace equation states that $\\Delta P = \\gamma (\\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2})$, where $R_1$ and $R_2$ are the two principal radii of curvature of the interface. The problem states that the interface is translationally invariant along the length $L$, which means it is straight in that direction. The radius of curvature along this direction is therefore infinite, let's say $R_2 \\to \\infty$, so its contribution $\\frac{1}{R_2} \\to 0$. The meniscus is thus a cylindrical surface. The Laplace pressure simplifies to:\n$$ \\Delta P = \\frac{\\gamma}{R_1} $$\nWe will denote the radius of curvature in the cross-sectional plane as $R \\equiv R_1$.\n\nNext, we find the radius of curvature $R$ from the geometry of the gap. In a cross-section perpendicular to the walls' length, the meniscus is a circular arc that meets the two vertical walls, separated by distance $g$, at a contact angle $\\theta$. By symmetry, the center of the circle of which the arc is a part must lie on the centerline between the two walls.\nLet's consider a right-angled triangle formed by:\n1. The center of curvature.\n2. The point of contact of the liquid on one wall.\n3. The projection of the center of curvature onto the plane of that wall. This is not helpful.\n\nA better geometric construction involves the center of the circle, a contact point on a wall, and the midpoint of the gap. The line from the center of curvature to the contact point is the radius $R$. This radius is perpendicular to the tangent of the liquid surface at that point. The contact angle $\\theta$ is the angle between the liquid surface (i.e., the tangent) and the solid wall. Therefore, the angle between the radius $R$ and the normal to the wall (a horizontal line) is also $\\theta$. In the right-angled triangle formed by the center of curvature, the contact point, and the point on the symmetry axis at the same vertical level as the contact point, the side adjacent to the angle $\\theta$ has length $\\frac{g}{2}$, and the hypotenuse is $R$.\nFrom this geometry, we have the relationship:\n$$ \\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{g/2}{R} $$\nSolving for the radius of curvature $R$:\n$$ R = \\frac{g}{2\\cos(\\theta)} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $R$ into the simplified Young-Laplace equation gives the pressure drop across the meniscus:\n$$ \\Delta P = \\frac{\\gamma}{R} = \\frac{\\gamma}{g / (2\\cos\\theta)} = \\frac{2\\gamma\\cos\\theta}{g} $$\nThis $\\Delta P$ is the magnitude of the pressure difference between the ambient pressure outside the liquid and the pressure inside the liquid ($P_{ambient} - P_{liquid}$). Since the pressure inside the liquid is lower, it creates a suction effect, pulling the walls together. This is a tensile, or attractive, force.\n\nThe problem directs us to calculate the force, $F$, as the product of this Laplace pressure and the wetted area on the wall, $A_w$. The liquid bridge spans a length $L$ along walls of height $H$. The term \"maximum\" force is interpreted as occurring for the maximum possible wetted area. Assuming the liquid wets the entire height of the wall over the length of the bridge, the wetted area on one wall is:\n$$ A_w = H \\times L $$\nThe magnitude of the capillary force on one wall is therefore:\n$$ F = \\Delta P \\cdot A_w = \\left( \\frac{2\\gamma\\cos\\theta}{g} \\right) (HL) $$\n$$ F = \\frac{2\\gamma H L \\cos\\theta}{g} $$\nThis is the derived expression for the tensile force.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of this force using the provided data. First, all values are converted to standard SI units (meters, Newtons).\n- $H = 1.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $L = 10.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 10.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $g = 100\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 100 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n- $\\gamma = 0.020\\,\\mathrm{N/m}$\n- $\\theta = 15^\\circ$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$ F = \\frac{2 \\times (0.020\\,\\mathrm{N/m}) \\times (1.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}) \\times (10.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m}) \\times \\cos(15^\\circ)}{1.0 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{m}} $$\n$$ F = \\frac{2 \\times 0.020 \\times 1.0 \\times 10.0 \\times 10^{-12}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-7}} \\times \\cos(15^\\circ) \\,\\mathrm{N} $$\n$$ F = \\frac{0.4 \\times 10^{-12}}{10^{-7}} \\times \\cos(15^\\circ) \\,\\mathrm{N} $$\n$$ F = 4.0 \\times 10^{-6} \\times \\cos(15^\\circ) \\,\\mathrm{N} $$\nThe value of $\\cos(15^\\circ)$ is approximately $0.9659258$.\n$$ F = (4.0 \\times 10^{-6}) \\times 0.9659258 \\,\\mathrm{N} \\approx 3.8637032 \\times 10^{-6} \\,\\mathrm{N} $$\nThe problem requires the answer in micro-Newtons ($\\mu\\mathrm{N}$), where $1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{N} = 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{N}$.\n$$ F \\approx 3.8637032 \\,\\mu\\mathrm{N} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$ F \\approx 3.864 \\,\\mu\\mathrm{N} $$",

Validation Analysis:**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of capillarity and the Young-Laplace equation, which are cornerstones of fluid mechanics at small scales. The physical scenario described—capillary collapse of high-aspect-ratio structures during drying—is a critical and well-documented issue in semiconductor manufacturing (stiction). The assumptions provided (negligible out-of-plane curvature, neglect of gravity) are standard and appropriate for simplifying the model to a tractable two-dimensional problem at the nanometer scale where surface forces dominate. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and a clear objective. The language is precise and objective. The given numerical values are physically realistic for such a system. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\n**Derivation and Solution**\n\nWe begin with the Young-Laplace equation, which relates the pressure difference across a curved liquid-vapor interface to the surface tension and the principal radii of curvature, $R_1$ and $R_2$:\n$$\n\\Delta P = \\gamma \\left( \\frac{1}{R_1} + \\frac{1}{R_2} \\right)\n$$\nHere, $\\Delta P$ is the pressure drop across the interface, defined as $P_{\\text{vapor}} - P_{\\text{liquid}}$.\n\nThe problem states that the curvature along the out-of-plane direction is negligible. This implies that one of the principal radii of curvature, say $R_2$, is infinite ($R_2 \\to \\infty$), and thus its reciprocal is zero ($1/R_2 \\to 0$). The Young-Laplace equation simplifies to:\n$$\n\\Delta P = \\frac{\\gamma}{R}\n$$\nwhere $R$ (formerly $R_1$) is the radius of curvature of the meniscus in the in-plane cross-section.\n\nTo relate $R$ to the geometry of the gap, we consider a cross-section of the two parallel lines separated by a distance $g$. The liquid meniscus forms a circular arc of radius $R$ that meets the vertical sidewalls at a contact angle $\\theta$. By geometric construction, a right-angled triangle is formed by the center of the circular arc, the point of contact on the wall, and the projection of the center onto the wall. The distance from the center of the circle to the wall is half the gap width, $g/2$. This distance is related to the radius $R$ and the contact angle $\\theta$ by:\n$$\n\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{g/2}{R}\n$$\nSolving for $R$, we find:\n$$\nR = \\frac{g}{2\\cos(\\theta)}\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $R$ into the simplified Young-Laplace equation gives the capillary pressure drop as a function of the contact angle $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\Delta P(\\theta) = \\gamma \\left( \\frac{2\\cos(\\theta)}{g} \\right) = \\frac{2\\gamma\\cos(\\theta)}{g}\n$$\nNext, we derive the capillary force per unit out-of-plane length, $F(\\theta)$. The problem statement provides a specific directive: \"using the definition of force as pressure integrated over area.\" This means we calculate the force resulting from the Laplace pressure $\\Delta P$ acting on the wetted area of the line. This force is an attractive force pulling the line inwards toward the liquid because the pressure inside the liquid, $P_{\\text{liquid}}$, is lower than the ambient pressure, $P_{\\text{vapor}}$. The force on an area element $dA$ is $d\\mathbf{F} = (P_{\\text{liquid}} - P_{\\text{vapor}}) d\\mathbf{A} = -\\Delta P d\\mathbf{A}$. The total force on the wetted area $A = h \\times L$ (where $L$ is the out-of-plane length) is attractive with magnitude:\n$$\nF_{\\text{total}} = \\Delta P \\cdot A = \\Delta P \\cdot h \\cdot L\n$$\nThe force per unit out-of-plane length, $F$, is therefore:\n$$\nF = \\frac{F_{\\text{total}}}{L} = \\Delta P \\cdot h\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\Delta P(\\theta)$:\n$$\nF(\\theta) = \\frac{2\\gamma h \\cos(\\theta)}{g}\n$$\nContact angle hysteresis implies that the contact angle $\\theta$ is not fixed but can assume any value in the range $[\\theta_{\\text{rec}}, \\theta_{\\text{adv}}]$. Consequently, the capillary pressure $\\Delta P$ and the force $F$ are not single-valued but exist within a range determined by this interval. The force $F(\\theta)$ is directly proportional to $\\cos(\\theta)$. For angles in the first quadrant ($0^{\\circ} \\le \\theta \\le 90^{\\circ}$), $\\cos(\\theta)$ is a monotonically decreasing function. Given that $\\theta_{\\text{rec}} < \\theta_{\\text{adv}}$, it follows that $\\cos(\\theta_{\\text{rec}}) > \\cos(\\theta_{\\text{adv}})$.\n\nThis leads to the definition of the minimum and maximum capillary forces:\n- The minimum force, $F_{\\min}$, corresponds to the largest angle in the hysteresis loop, the advancing contact angle $\\theta_{\\text{adv}}$.\n- The maximum force, $F_{\\max}$, corresponds to the smallest angle, the receding contact angle $\\theta_{\\text{rec}}$.\n\nThis is consistent with the problem's request to find the range $(F_{\\min}, F_{\\max})$ corresponding to $\\theta_{\\text{adv}}$ and $\\theta_{\\text{rec}}$, respectively.\nThe expressions are:\n$$\nF_{\\min} = F(\\theta_{\\text{adv}}) = \\frac{2\\gamma h \\cos(\\theta_{\\text{adv}})}{g}\n$$\n$$\nF_{\\max} = F(\\theta_{\\text{rec}}) = \\frac{2\\gamma h \\cos(\\theta_{\\text{rec}})}{g}\n$$\nWe now substitute the given numerical values into these expressions:\n- $g = 60~\\text{nm} = 60 \\times 10^{-9}~\\text{m}$\n- $h = 400~\\text{nm} = 400 \\times 10^{-9}~\\text{m}$\n- $\\gamma = 0.072~\\text{N}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}$\n- $\\theta_{\\text{adv}} = 35^{\\circ}$\n- $\\theta_{\\text{rec}} = 20^{\\circ}$\n\nFirst, we calculate $F_{\\min}$:\n$$\nF_{\\min} = \\frac{2(0.072~\\text{N}\\,\\text{m}^{-1})(400 \\times 10^{-9}~\\text{m})\\cos(35^{\\circ})}{60 \\times 10^{-9}~\\text{m}} = \\frac{2 \\times 0.072 \\times 400}{60} \\cos(35^{\\circ})\n$$\n$$\nF_{\\min} = 0.96 \\cos(35^{\\circ}) \\approx 0.96 \\times 0.819152 \\approx 0.786386~\\text{N}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $F_{\\min} = 0.7864~\\text{N}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}$.\n\nNext, we calculate $F_{\\max}$:\n$$\nF_{\\max} = \\frac{2(0.072~\\text{N}\\,\\text{m}^{-1})(400 \\times 10^{-9}~\\text{m})\\cos(20^{\\circ})}{60 \\times 10^{-9}~\\text{m}} = \\frac{2 \\times 0.072 \\times 400}{60} \\cos(20^{\\circ})\n$$\n$$\nF_{\\max} = 0.96 \\cos(20^{\\circ}) \\approx 0.96 \\times 0.939693 \\approx 0.902105~\\text{N}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $F_{\\max} = 0.9021~\\text{N}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}$.\n\nThe range of the capillary force per unit length is $(0.7864~\\text{N}\\,\\text{m}^{-1}, 0.9021~\\text{N}\\,\\text{m}^{-1})$.",

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of a dimensionless group that quantifies the propensity for a photoresist line to collapse under capillary forces, followed by a calculation of the fractional reduction in this propensity when the rinsing liquid is changed. The derivation will be based on first principles, specifically by balancing the characteristic capillary-induced bending moment against the elastic restoring moment of the photoresist line, which is modeled as an Euler-Bernoulli beam.\n\nFirst, we establish the characteristic scales of the moments involved.\n\nThe driving force for collapse is the capillary pull from the liquid meniscus. The problem states that the capillary pull per unit out-of-plane width ($b$) is of order $\\gamma$, where $\\gamma$ is the liquid-air surface tension. Therefore, the total capillary force, $F_{cap}$, acting on a line of width $b$ can be estimated as being proportional to the product of this force per unit width and the width itself:\n$$F_{cap} \\sim \\gamma b$$\nThis force is said to act with a characteristic lever arm of order $H$, the height of the line. The capillary-induced bending moment, $M_{cap}$, at the base of the line is therefore the product of this force and the lever arm:\n$$M_{cap} \\sim (\\gamma b) H = \\gamma b H$$\n\nNext, we establish the characteristic elastic restoring moment, $M_{el, char}$, of the beam. The Euler-Bernoulli beam theory states that the internal elastic moment, $M_{el}$, is proportional to the curvature, $\\kappa$, of the beam:\n$$M_{el} = E I \\kappa$$\nwhere $E$ is the Young's modulus and $I$ is the second moment of area of the beam's cross-section. To form a dimensionless group, we must compare the applied moment, $M_{cap}$, to a characteristic moment that represents the intrinsic bending stiffness of the beam. A natural choice for a characteristic curvature, $\\kappa_{char}$, for a beam of height $H$ is the inverse of its height, $\\kappa_{char} \\sim 1/H$. This corresponds physically to bending the beam into an arc with a radius of curvature on the order of its own length, a state indicative of significant deformation. The corresponding characteristic elastic moment is:\n$$M_{el, char} \\sim E I \\kappa_{char} = \\frac{E I}{H}$$\n\nThe propensity for collapse is quantified by a dimensionless group, which we shall call $X$, formed by the ratio of the driving capillary moment to the characteristic elastic restoring moment. A value of $X \\gg 1$ implies that the capillary moment is large compared to the beam's stiffness, indicating a high propensity for collapse.\n$$X = \\frac{M_{cap}}{M_{el, char}} \\sim \\frac{\\gamma b H}{E I / H} = \\frac{\\gamma b H^2}{E I}$$\n\nThe problem provides the formula for the second moment of area for a rectangular cross-section of thickness $t$ and width $b$, bending about the axis parallel to the width: $I = \\frac{b t^3}{12}$.

Note that the out-of-plane width $b$ cancels, indicating that, under this model, the collapse propensity depends on the aspect ratio $H/t$ and material properties, but not on the absolute width of the line.\n\nNow, we compute the value of this dimensionless group, $X$, for the two specified rinse conditions using the given parameters:\n$E = 3.0 \\times 10^9 \\, \\text{Pa}$\n$H = 120 \\, \\text{nm} = 1.20 \\times 10^{-7} \\, \\text{m}$\n$t = 40 \\, \\text{nm} = 4.0 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\text{m}$\n$\\gamma_1 = 0.072 \\, \\text{N/m}$ (deionized water)\n$\\gamma_2 = 0.025 \\, \\text{N/m}$ (IPA co-solvent)\n\nFor the deionized water rinse, the dimensionless group $X_1$ is:\n$$X_1 = \\frac{12 \\gamma_1 H^2}{E t^3} = \\frac{12 (0.072) (1.20 \\times 10^{-7})^2}{(3.0 \\times 10^9) (4.0 \\times 10^{-8})^3}$$\n$$X_1 = \\frac{12 \\times 0.072 \\times 1.44 \\times 10^{-14}}{3.0 \\times 10^9 \\times 64 \\times 10^{-24}} = \\frac{1.24416 \\times 10^{-14}}{1.92 \\times 10^{-13}} \\approx 0.0648$$\n\nFor the IPA co-solvent rinse, the dimensionless group $X_2$ is:\n$$X_2 = \\frac{12 \\gamma_2 H^2}{E t^3} = \\frac{12 (0.025) (1.20 \\times 10^{-7})^2}{(3.0 \\times 10^9) (4.0 \\times 10^{-8})^3}$$\n$$X_2 = \\frac{12 \\times 0.025 \\times 1.44 \\times 10^{-14}}{1.92 \\times 10^{-13}} = \\frac{0.432 \\times 10^{-14}}{1.92 \\times 10^{-13}} \\approx 0.0225$$\n\nThe problem asks for the fractional reduction in collapse propensity, $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{frac}}$, defined as:\n$$\\Delta_{\\mathrm{frac}} = \\frac{X_1 - X_2}{X_1}$$\nUsing the computed values:\n$$\\Delta_{\\mathrm{frac}} = \\frac{0.0648 - 0.0225}{0.0648} = \\frac{0.0423}{0.0648} \\approx 0.652777...$$\n\nAlternatively, we can simplify the expression for $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{frac}}$ before substituting numerical values. Since $X$ is directly proportional to $\\gamma$, and all other parameters are constant between the two conditions, we can write:\n$$\\Delta_{\\mathrm{frac}} = \\frac{X(\\gamma_1) - X(\\gamma_2)}{X(\\gamma_1)} = 1 - \\frac{X(\\gamma_2)}{X(\\gamma_1)} = 1 - \\frac{\\frac{12 \\gamma_2 H^2}{E t^3}}{\\frac{12 \\gamma_1 H^2}{E t^3}} = 1 - \\frac{\\gamma_2}{\\gamma_1}$$\nThis simplification provides a more direct and robust way to calculate the fractional reduction, as it depends only on the ratio of the surface tensions.\nSubstituting the values for $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$:\n$$\\Delta_{\\mathrm{frac}} = 1 - \\frac{0.025}{0.072} = 1 - \\frac{25}{72}$$\n$$\\Delta_{\\mathrm{frac}} = 1 - 0.347222... = 0.652777...$$\nBoth calculation methods yield the same result, confirming the consistency of our model.\n\nThe final step is to round the result to four significant figures:\n$$\\Delta_{\\mathrm{frac}} \\approx 0.6528$$\nThis result signifies that switching from a pure water rinse to an IPA co-solvent rinse reduces the propensity for pattern collapse by approximately $65.28\\%$.",
