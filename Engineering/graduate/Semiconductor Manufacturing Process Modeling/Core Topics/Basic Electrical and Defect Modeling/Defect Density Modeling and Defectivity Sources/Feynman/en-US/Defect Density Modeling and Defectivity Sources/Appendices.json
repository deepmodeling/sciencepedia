            "problem": "A pair of long, parallel metal interconnect lines of length $L$ are patterned on a planar wafer surface. Each line has width $w$ and the center-to-center pitch is $p$, so the edge-to-edge gap is $g = p - w$. Defects are modeled as circular particles of radius $s$ whose centers land uniformly over the surface. Let the size-resolved areal density of particle centers be $D(s) = D_{\\mathrm{tot}} f(s)$, where $f(s)$ is a probability density on $s \\ge 0$ and $D_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ is the total areal density of defect centers integrated over all sizes. A shorting fault between the two lines occurs if and only if a particle overlaps both lines simultaneously. Use the following foundational bases:\n\n- By definition, the size-dependent critical area $A_{c}(s)$ is the two-dimensional Lebesgue measure of the locus of defect-center positions that produce the specified failure for a particle of radius $s$.\n- The expected number of shorting defects for the line pair is $N = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} D(s)\\, A_{c}(s)\\, ds$.\n\nAssume $L$ is much larger than all relevant defect sizes so that end effects are negligible, and the lines are straight and perfectly parallel over length $L$.\n\n1.

            "solution": "The goal is to derive the short-circuit critical area $A_{c}(s)$ from first principles and then evaluate the expected count $N$ by integrating over the defect size distribution. We proceed in two parts.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of $A_{c}(s)$.\n\n- Geometry. Let the two lines be parallel along the $y$-axis over length $L$. Place coordinates so that the gap between the facing edges lies symmetrically about $x=0$, with the facing left and right edges at $x=-g/2$ and $x=+g/2$, respectively. The left line occupies $x \\in [-(g/2+w), -g/2]$, and the right line occupies $x \\in [g/2, g/2 + w]$, each extending along $y \\in [0, L]$. The edge-to-edge gap is $g = p - w$.\n\n- Failure condition for a particle of radius $s$. A circular particle centered at $(x_{0}, y_{0})$ causes a short if its disk overlaps both line regions simultaneously. Equivalently, $(x_{0}, y_{0})$ must lie within a distance $s$ of each line region. The set of such centers is the intersection of the radius-$s$ morphological dilations of the two line regions.\n\n- Reduction to a one-dimensional overlap in $x$. Neglecting end effects ($L \\gg s$), the relevant extent along $y$ is essentially length $L$ for both dilations, so the $y$-overlap length is $L$. Along $x$, the dilation of the left line by radius $s$ spans $x \\in [-(g/2+w)-s,\\,-g/2 + s]$, and the dilation of the right line by radius $s$ spans $x \\in [g/2 - s,\\, g/2 + w + s]$. Their intersection along $x$ is the interval\n$$\n\\big[g/2 - s,\\,-g/2 + s\\big]\n$$\nwhich has width\n$$\n(-g/2 + s) - (g/2 - s) = 2s - g.\n$$\nThis intersection is nonempty if and only if $2s - g \\ge 0$, i.e., $s \\ge g/2$. The line width $w$ does not enter this overlap width because the overlap is governed by the facing edges.\n\n- Critical area. Therefore, the measure of the locus of centers that cause a short is a rectangle of length $L$ along $y$ and width $\\max(0,\\,2s - g)$ along $x$.

            "solution": "First, we derive the closed-form expression for the yield $Y$ as a function of the mean number of killer defects $\\mu$ and the Gamma distribution shape parameter $k$.\n\nThe yield $Y$ is defined as the unconditional probability that a die has zero killer defects, $Y = \\mathbb{P}\\{N=0\\}$. We are given the conditional probability of zero defects for a fixed local defect intensity $\\Lambda$, which follows a Poisson distribution:\n$$\n\\mathbb{P}\\{N=0 \\mid \\Lambda=\\lambda\\} = \\exp(-\\lambda)\n$$\nThe local intensity $\\Lambda$ is itself a random variable that follows a Gamma distribution with shape parameter $k  0$ and scale parameter $\\theta  0$.

The variance of the defect intensity $\\Lambda$ is $\\mathrm{Var}(\\Lambda) = k\\theta^2 = k(\\mu/k)^2 = \\mu^2/k$.\n- A small value of $k$ corresponds to a large variance, indicating significant spatial variation in defect density across dies. This is referred to as high clustering.\n- A large value of $k$ corresponds to a small variance, indicating that the defect density is more uniform across dies, approaching the mean value $\\mu$. The limit $k \\to \\infty$ represents a perfectly uniform (non-clustered) defect deposition process.\n\nOur calculations show that for a fixed $\\mu = 0.5$, the yield $Y$ decreases as $k$ increases: $Y(k=1) \\approx 0.6667$, $Y(k=5) \\approx 0.6209$, and $Y(k\\to\\infty) \\approx 0.6065$. The function $Y(k) = (1 + \\mu/k)^{-k}$ is a strictly decreasing function of $k$ for $k0$ and constant $\\mu0$.\n\nThis means that for a fixed average defect density, **yield is higher when defects are more clustered** (smaller $k$) and lower when they are more uniformly distributed (larger $k$). The minimum possible yield for a given $\\mu$ is $\\exp(-\\mu)$, which occurs in the total absence of clustering ($k \\to \\infty$). This result can be rigorously proven using Jensen's inequality. Since the yield function for a given intensity, $\\phi(\\Lambda) = \\exp(-\\Lambda)$, is a convex function, we have $\\mathbb{E}[\\phi(\\Lambda)] \\ge \\phi(\\mathbb{E}[\\Lambda])$. This translates to $Y = \\mathbb{E}[\\exp(-\\Lambda)] \\ge \\exp(-\\mathbb{E}[\\Lambda]) = \\exp(-\\mu)$, confirming that the yield in any clustered scenario ($k  \\infty$) is greater than or equal to the yield in the uniform scenario ($k \\to \\infty$).\n\nThe physical intuition is that clustering creates a bimodal-like outcome: a subpopulation of dies in \"hot spots\" with high defect intensity $\\Lambda$ and consequently very low yield (near $0$), and another subpopulation in \"cold spots\" with low $\\Lambda$ and consequently very high yield (near $1$). The large number of high-yield dies from the cold spots more than compensates for the few zero-yield dies from the hot spots, pulling the overall average yield $Y$ up compared to the case where every die has the same moderate defect intensity $\\mu$.",

This requires the well-known limit definition of the exponential function: $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} (1+x/n)^n = \\exp(x)$.\n$$\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\Delta Y(k) = \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\left[\\left(1 + \\frac{m}{k}\\right)^{-k} - \\left(1 + \\frac{2m}{k}\\right)^{-k}\\right]$$\nLet's evaluate each term separately.\n$$\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{m}{k}\\right)^{-k} = \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{m}{k}\\right)^{k}} = \\frac{1}{\\exp(m)} = \\exp(-m)$$\n$$\\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{2m}{k}\\right)^{-k} = \\lim_{k \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{2m}{k}\\right)^{k}} = \\frac{1}{\\exp(2m)} = \\exp(-2m)$$\nTherefore, the redundancy benefit in the Poisson limit, which we denote $\\Delta Y(\\infty)$, is:\n$$\\Delta Y(\\infty) = \\exp(-m) - \\exp(-2m)$$\n\n### Numerical Calculation for $m = 0.2$\n\nWe are given $m = 0.2$.\n\nFor $k=1$:\n$$\\Delta Y(1) = \\frac{1}{1+0.2} - \\frac{1}{1+2(0.2)} = \\frac{1}{1.2} - \\frac{1}{1.4}$$\n$$\\Delta Y(1) = \\frac{5}{6} - \\frac{5}{7} = \\frac{35 - 30}{42} = \\frac{5}{42} \\approx 0.1190476...$$\nRounding to five significant figures, we get $0.11905$.\n\nFor $k \\to \\infty$:\n$$\\Delta Y(\\infty) = \\exp(-0.2) - \\exp(-0.4)$$\nUsing a calculator:\n$$\\exp(-0.2) \\approx 0.818730753$$\n$$\\exp(-0.4) \\approx 0.670320046$$\n$$\\Delta Y(\\infty) \\approx 0.818730753 - 0.670320046 = 0.148410707$$\nRounding to five significant figures, we get $0.14841$.\n\nThe final answer requires the two numerical values in the order $k=1$, $k \\to \\infty$.",
