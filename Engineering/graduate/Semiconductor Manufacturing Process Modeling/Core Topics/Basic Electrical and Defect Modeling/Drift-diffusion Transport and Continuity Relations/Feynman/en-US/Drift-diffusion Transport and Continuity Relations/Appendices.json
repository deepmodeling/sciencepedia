            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of electron transport in a semiconductor under the influence of both a concentration gradient and an external electric field. The total electron current density, $J_n$, is the sum of the drift component, $J_{n, \\text{drift}}$, due to the electric field, and the diffusion component, $J_{n, \\text{diff}}$, due to the concentration gradient.\n\nFor a one-dimensional system along the $x$-axis, these current densities are given by:\n$$J_{n, \\text{drift}}(x) = q\\,n(x)\\,\\mu_{n}\\,E_x(x)$$\n$$J_{n, \\text{diff}}(x) = q\\,D_{n}\\,\\frac{dn(x)}{dx}$$\nwhere $q$ is the elementary charge, $n(x)$ is the electron concentration, $\\mu_{n}$ is the electron mobility, $E_x(x)$ is the electric field, and $D_{n}$ is the electron diffusion coefficient. We assume $\\mu_n$ and $D_n$ are constant in the specified region, which is reasonable for light doping and a small concentration variation.\n\n**1. Condition for Diffusion Dominance**\n\nThe first task is to derive the condition for which the magnitude of the diffusion term is greater than the magnitude of the drift term. This is expressed by the inequality:\n$$\\lvert J_{n, \\text{diff}} \\rvert > \\lvert J_{n, \\text{drift}} \\rvert$$\nSubstituting the definitions for the current densities:\n$$\\left\\lvert q\\,D_{n}\\,\\frac{dn}{dx} \\right\\rvert > \\lvert q\\,n\\,\\mu_{n}\\,E_x \\rvert$$\nSince $q$, $D_{n}$, $n(x)$, and $\\mu_{n}$ are all positive quantities, we can simplify this to:\n$$D_{n} \\left\\lvert \\frac{dn}{dx} \\right\\rvert > n(x)\\,\\mu_{n}\\,\\lvert E_x \\rvert$$\nIn a one-dimensional problem, the gradient $\\nabla n$ is simply $\\frac{dn}{dx}\\hat{x}$, so its magnitude is $\\lvert \\frac{dn}{dx} \\rvert$. We can rewrite the inequality in terms of the general vector quantities $\\nabla n$ and $E$:\n$$D_{n} \\lvert \\nabla n \\rvert > n\\,\\mu_{n}\\,\\lvert E \\rvert$$\nTo proceed, we invoke the Einstein relation, a fundamental result from statistical mechanics that holds for nondegenerate carriers in thermal equilibrium. The problem states the wafer is nondegenerate and near equilibrium at a temperature $T$, so its use is justified. The Einstein relation connects the diffusion coefficient $D_n$ to the mobility $\\mu_n$:\n$$D_{n} = \\mu_{n} \\frac{k_{B}T}{q}$$\nwhere $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature. Substituting this into our inequality gives:\n$$\\left(\\mu_{n} \\frac{k_{B}T}{q}\\right) \\lvert \\nabla n \\rvert > n\\,\\mu_{n}\\,\\lvert E \\rvert$$\nSince the mobility $\\mu_n$ is non-zero, we can divide both sides by it:\n$$\\frac{k_{B}T}{q} \\lvert \\nabla n \\rvert > n \\lvert E \\rvert$$\nSolving for the magnitude of the electric field $\\lvert E \\rvert$, we find the condition for diffusion dominance:\n$$\\lvert E \\rvert < \\frac{k_{B}T}{q} \\frac{\\lvert \\nabla n \\rvert}{n}$$\nThis is the required condition of the form $\\lvert E \\rvert < E_c$, where the threshold field $E_c$ is given by:\n$$E_{c} = \\frac{k_{B}T}{q} \\frac{\\lvert \\nabla n \\rvert}{n}$$\nThe term $V_{th} = k_B T / q$ is known as the thermal voltage.\n\n**2. Evaluation of the Ratio R**\n\nThe second task is to compute the dimensionless ratio $R$ at the midpoint of the region, $x=L/2$. The ratio is defined as:\n$$R \\equiv \\frac{\\lvert q D_{n} \\nabla n \\rvert}{\\lvert q\\, n\\, \\mu_{n}\\, E \\rvert}$$\nGiven that all quantities are positive, this can be written as:\n$$R = \\frac{D_{n} \\lvert \\nabla n \\rvert}{n\\, \\mu_{n}\\, \\lvert E \\rvert}$$\nUsing the Einstein relation $D_{n} = \\mu_{n} (k_{B}T/q)$, we can simplify the expression for $R$ by canceling $\\mu_n$:\n$$R = \\frac{(\\mu_{n} k_{B}T/q) \\lvert \\nabla n \\rvert}{n\\, \\mu_{n}\\, \\lvert E \\rvert} = \\frac{k_{B}T}{q} \\frac{\\lvert \\nabla n \\rvert}{n \\lvert E \\rvert}$$\nNow we must evaluate the terms in this expression at $x=L/2$ using the given data.\n\nFirst, we determine the electron concentration profile $n(x)$. The problem states local charge neutrality, so $n(x) \\approx N_D(x)$. The donor profile $N_D(x)$ is linear:\n$$N_D(x) = N_D(0) + \\frac{N_D(L) - N_D(0)}{L} x$$\nSo, $n(x)$ is also linear. The gradient $\\nabla n$ is the derivative with respect to $x$, which is constant throughout the region:\n$$\\nabla n = \\frac{dn}{dx} = \\frac{n(L) - n(0)}{L} \\approx \\frac{N_D(L) - N_D(0)}{L}$$\nUsing the given values:\n$N_D(0) = 1.0 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$\n$N_D(L) = 1.5 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$\n$L = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 10 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{cm} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n$$\\nabla n = \\frac{(1.5 \\times 10^{15} - 1.0 \\times 10^{15})\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{cm}} = \\frac{0.5 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}}{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{cm}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{17}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-4}$$\nSince this is positive, $\\lvert \\nabla n \\rvert = 5.0 \\times 10^{17}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-4}$.\n\nNext, we find the electron concentration $n$ at the midpoint, $x=L/2$:\n$$n(L/2) = n(0) + \\frac{n(L) - n(0)}{L} \\left(\\frac{L}{2}\\right) = \\frac{n(0) + n(L)}{2}$$\n$$n(L/2) \\approx \\frac{N_D(0) + N_D(L)}{2} = \\frac{(1.0 \\times 10^{15} + 1.5 \\times 10^{15})\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}}{2} = 1.25 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$$\n\nThe thermal voltage at $T=300\\,\\mathrm{K}$ is:\n$$\\frac{k_B T}{q} \\approx \\frac{(1.3806 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K})(300\\,\\mathrm{K})}{1.6022 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}} \\approx 0.02585\\,\\mathrm{V}$$\nThe magnitude of the applied electric field is given as $\\lvert E \\rvert = 2.0\\,\\mathrm{V/cm}$.\n\nNow we can substitute all the numerical values into the expression for $R$:\n$$R = (0.02585\\,\\mathrm{V}) \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{17}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-4}}{(1.25 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3})(2.0\\,\\mathrm{V/cm})}$$\n$$R = \\frac{0.02585 \\times 5.0 \\times 10^{17}}{2.5 \\times 10^{15}} = \\frac{0.12925 \\times 10^{17}}{2.5 \\times 10^{15}}$$\n$$R = 0.0517 \\times 10^{2} = 5.17$$\nThe calculation confirms that the units cancel out, resulting in a dimensionless ratio. Rounding to three significant figures, the value is $5.17$. The provided electron mobility $\\mu_{n} = 1350\\,\\mathrm{cm^{2}\\,V^{-1}\\,s^{-1}}$ is consistent with this result, as a separate calculation using it to find $D_n$ first would yield the same value for $R$, but the cancellation approach is more direct.",

            "solution": "**Derivation of the Governing Partial Differential Equation**\n\nThe dynamics of the electron concentration $n(x,t)$ in one dimension are described by the electron continuity equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t} = \\frac{1}{q} \\frac{\\partial J_n}{\\partial x} - U_n\n$$\nwhere $q$ is the elementary charge, $J_n$ is the electron current density, and $U_n$ is the net recombination rate. The total concentration is $n(x,t) = n_0 + \\delta n(x,t)$, where $n_0$ is the constant equilibrium concentration and $\\delta n$ is the excess concentration. Thus, $\\frac{\\partial n}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial \\delta n}{\\partial t}$. The net recombination rate is $U_n = R - G$. For $t>0$, generation is zero ($G=0$) and the recombination is linearized as $R \\approx \\delta n/\\tau$, so $U_n \\approx \\delta n/\\tau$.

Setting $\\phi = \\Phi_M/q$ is an oversimplification that ignores the influence of doping on the contact potential. Setting $n = p = n_i$ is only valid for intrinsic semiconductors and would violate charge neutrality in a doped material, creating a non-physical space charge.\n\n**C.** This option is incorrect. Approximating $n = N_D^+$ and $p = N_A^-$ is a crude assumption for bulk regions, not a contact boundary condition, and it violates the law of mass action.

It describes the boundary conditions for a Schottky contact, which is fundamentally different from an ideal ohmic contact. Key features of a Schottky model, such as thermionic emission, non-neutrality, and quasi-Fermi level splitting under bias, are explicitly excluded by the definition of an ideal ohmic contact.\n\nTherefore, option A provides the correct and physically sound blueprint.",
