This yields:\n$$\nn_R = \\frac{-K_{\\text{loss}}(p) + \\sqrt{K_{\\text{loss}}(p)^2 + 4 k_{\\text{rec}} \\alpha \\chi p P_{\\text{RF}}}}{2 k_{\\text{rec}}}\n$$\nFor each operating point $(p, P_{\\text{RF}})$, we first calculate $K_{\\text{loss}}(p)$ and then solve for $n_R$.\n\n**2. Calculation of Damköhler Number ($\\mathrm{Da}$) and Regime Classification**\n\nThe Damköhler number $\\mathrm{Da}$ represents the ratio of the surface reaction rate to the gas-phase mass transport rate. First, we calculate the mass transfer coefficient $h_m(p)$, which is pressure-dependent:\n$$\nh_m(p) = \\frac{h_0}{1 + p/P_{\\text{ref}}}\n$$\nThen, $\\mathrm{Da}$ is calculated using the given surface reaction rate coefficient $k_s$:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Da} = \\frac{k_s}{h_m(p)}\n$$\nThe deposition regime is then classified using the following integer codes based on the value of $\\mathrm{Da}$:\n-   Regime Code $c = 0$ (Radical-limited) if $\\mathrm{Da} < 0.5$.\n-   Regime Code $c = 1$ (Balanced) if $0.5 \\le \\mathrm{Da} \\le 2.0$.\n-   Regime Code $c = 2$ (Transport-limited) if $\\mathrm{Da} > 2.0$.\n\n**3. Calculation of Deposition Rate ($G$)**\n\nThe deposition rate is modeled using a resistances-in-series concept, where the overall deposition process is limited by both mass transport to the surface and the chemical reaction at the surface. The effective rate coefficient, $k_{\\text{eff}}$, is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{k_{\\text{eff}}} = \\frac{1}{h_m(p)} + \\frac{1}{k_s} \\implies k_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{h_m(p) k_s}{h_m(p) + k_s}\n$$\nThe deposition flux of radicals, $\\Gamma$, is the product of this effective coefficient and the bulk radical density $n_R$:\n$$\n\\Gamma = k_{\\text{eff}} n_R\n$$\nFinally, the deposition rate $G$ in nm/s is obtained by scaling the flux $\\Gamma$ with the conversion factor $\\gamma$:\n$$\nG = \\gamma \\Gamma = \\gamma \\left( \\frac{h_m(p) k_s}{h_m(p) + k_s} \\right) n_R\n$$\nThis value is then rounded to three decimal places as required.\n\n**4. Determination of the Optimal Window Flag**\n\nA boolean flag, $b$, indicates whether an operating point falls within the optimal window. The flag is set to `True` if and only if both of the following conditions are satisfied:\n1.  The regime is balanced, i.e., the regime code $c = 1$.\n2.  The deposition rate $G$ is greater than or equal to the minimum threshold $g_{\\min} = 1.5$ nm/s.\nOtherwise, the flag is set to `False`.",
