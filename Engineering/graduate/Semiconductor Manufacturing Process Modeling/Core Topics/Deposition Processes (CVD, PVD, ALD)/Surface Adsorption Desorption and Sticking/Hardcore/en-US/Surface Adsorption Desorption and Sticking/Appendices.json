Assume the following fundamental base:\n\n- The gas impingement flux is constant and equal to $F$ (molecules per unit area per unit time), consistent with kinetic theory of gases for a constant precursor partial pressure and temperature.\n- Adsorption is site-limited and mean-field: the adsorption rate per unit area is proportional to the fraction of empty sites, with proportionality factor $s_{0} F$, where $s_{0}$ is the intrinsic sticking probability for an empty site.\n- Desorption is reversible and first order in coverage: the desorption rate per unit area is $k_{des} \\, \\theta \\, N_{s}$, where $k_{des}$ is the desorption rate constant (per unit time) and $N_{s}$ is the areal density of adsorption sites.\n\nStarting from the above assumptions and conservation of site occupancy, derive the governing balance for $\\theta(t)$ during the pulse and solve it to obtain the time-dependent coverage under reversible adsorption and desorption.
