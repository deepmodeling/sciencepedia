            "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is based on the established Deal-Grove model for the thermal oxidation of silicon, a fundamental concept in semiconductor manufacturing process modeling. All necessary physical constants and experimental data are provided, and the problem statement is self-contained and internally consistent. The tasks are clearly defined and lead to a unique, meaningful solution. Thus, the problem is valid, and a solution can be formulated.\n\n### Task 1: Derivation of the Early-Time Growth Law\n\nThe oxidation process involves two sequential steps: the transport of oxidant species through the existing oxide layer and the chemical reaction at the silicon/oxide interface. In a steady state, the fluxes associated with these two steps must be equal.\n\nThe flux due to transport is given by Fick's law:\n$$J = D \\frac{C^{*} - C_{i}}{x}$$\nwhere $D$ is the oxidant diffusivity in the oxide, $C^{*}$ is the oxidant concentration at the gas/oxide surface, $C_{i}$ is the oxidant concentration at the silicon/oxide interface, and $x$ is the oxide thickness.\n\nThe flux consumed by the interfacial reaction is given as a first-order process:\n$$J = k_{i} C_{i}$$\nwhere $k_{i}$ is the interfacial reaction rate constant, which depends on the silicon crystal orientation.\n\nEquating these two expressions for the flux $J$ allows us to solve for the unknown interfacial concentration $C_{i}$:\n$$k_{i} C_{i} = D \\frac{C^{*} - C_{i}}{x}$$\n$$k_{i} C_{i} x = D C^{*} - D C_{i}$$\n$$C_{i} (k_{i} x + D) = D C^{*}$$\n$$C_{i} = \\frac{D C^{*}}{k_{i} x + D} = \\frac{C^{*}}{1 + \\frac{k_{i} x}{D}}$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $C_{i}$ back into the reaction rate equation, $J = k_{i} C_{i}$, yields the overall flux as a function of oxide thickness $x$:\n$$J = k_{i} \\left( \\frac{C^{*}}{1 + \\frac{k_{i} x}{D}} \\right) = \\frac{k_{i} C^{*}}{1 + \\frac{k_{i}}{D} x}$$\n\nThe rate of oxide growth, $\\frac{dx}{dt}$, is related to this flux through stoichiometry:\n$$\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{J}{N_{1}}$$\nwhere $N_{1}$ is the number of oxidant moles incorporated into a unit volume of silicon dioxide ($\\text{SiO}_2$).\n\nSubstituting the expression for $J$ gives the general form of the Deal-Grove growth law:\n$$\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{1}{N_{1}} \\frac{k_{i} C^{*}}{1 + \\frac{k_{i}}{D} x}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the growth law in the early-time, reaction-limited regime, which corresponds to the limit of very small oxide thickness, $x \\rightarrow 0$. In this limit, the term $\\frac{k_{i}}{D} x$ in the denominator becomes negligible compared to $1$:\n$$\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\left( 1 + \\frac{k_{i}}{D} x \\right) = 1$$\n\nTherefore, the early-time growth law is:\n$$\\left. \\frac{dx}{dt} \\right|_{x \\rightarrow 0} = \\frac{k_{i} C^{*}}{N_{1}}$$\nThis result shows that for very thin oxides, the growth rate is constant, leading to a linear relationship between thickness and time, $x(t) = \\left(\\frac{k_i C^*}{N_1}\\right) t$. The overall process is limited by the rate of the surface reaction, $k_i$.\n\n### Task 2: Determination of $k_i(100)$ and $k_i(111)$\n\nTo determine the values of $k_{i}$, we must first calculate the constants $C^{*}$ and $N_{1}$ and then find the growth rates $\\frac{dx}{dt}$ from the provided experimental data.\n\n**Calculation of Constants:**\nThe oxidant concentration at the gas/oxide surface, $C^{*}$, is given by Henry's law:\n$$C^{*} = H p_{\\mathrm{O}_{2}}$$\nWith $H = 1.00 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{mol} \\ \\text{cm}^{-3} \\ \\text{atm}^{-1}$ and $p_{\\mathrm{O}_{2}} = 1.00 \\ \\text{atm}$:\n$$C^{*} = (1.00 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{mol} \\ \\text{cm}^{-3} \\ \\text{atm}^{-1}) \\times (1.00 \\ \\text{atm}) = 1.00 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{mol} \\ \\text{cm}^{-3}$$\n\nThe number of oxidant moles per unit volume of oxide, $N_{1}$, is the molar density of $\\text{SiO}_2$. Note that the reaction is $\\text{Si} + \\text{O}_2 \\rightarrow \\text{SiO}_2$, so one mole of $\\text{O}_2$ molecules is consumed for every mole of $\\text{SiO}_2$ formed.\n$$N_{1} = \\frac{\\rho_{\\mathrm{SiO_{2}}}}{M_{\\mathrm{SiO_{2}}}}$$\nWith $\\rho_{\\mathrm{SiO_{2}}} = 2.20 \\ \\text{g} \\ \\text{cm}^{-3}$ and $M_{\\mathrm{SiO_{2}}} = 60.08 \\ \\text{g} \\ \\text{mol}^{-1}$:\n$$N_{1} = \\frac{2.20 \\ \\text{g} \\ \\text{cm}^{-3}}{60.08 \\ \\text{g} \\ \\text{mol}^{-1}} \\approx 0.036618 \\ \\text{mol} \\ \\text{cm}^{-3}$$\n\n**Determination of Growth Rates:**\nThe provided data for $x(t)$ for both orientations show a perfectly linear relationship, confirming that the experiment is in the reaction-limited regime.

The parameters provided, such as a pressure of $20$ atm and a compressibility factor of $0.9$ for steam, are physically realistic for high-pressure oxidation processes.

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and objective.\n- **Action:** Proceed to the solution.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe oxidation of silicon is described by the Deal–Grove model. The general equation for oxide thickness, $x$, as a function of time, $t$, is given by:\n$$x^2(t) + Ax(t) = B(t + \\tau)$$\nwhere $A$ and $B$ are the linear and parabolic rate constants, respectively, and $\\tau$ is a time shift accounting for any initial oxide.\n\nThe parabolic rate constant, $B$, is defined as:\n$$B = \\frac{2DC^{*}}{N_1}$$\nwhere $D$ is the effective diffusivity of the oxidant species in the oxide, $C^{*}$ is the equilibrium concentration of the oxidant at the gas-oxide interface, and $N_1$ is the number of oxidant molecules incorporated into a unit volume of the resulting silicon dioxide.\n\nThe problem states that the process is in the long-time, diffusion-limited regime. In this regime, the oxide is thick, and the growth rate is limited by the diffusion of oxidant through the existing oxide layer. Mathematically, this corresponds to the parabolic term dominating the linear term in the Deal-Grove equation, i.e., $x^2 \\gg Ax$. Therefore, the model simplifies to:\n$$x^2(t) \\approx Bt$$\nSolving for the oxide thickness, we get:\n$$x(t) \\approx \\sqrt{Bt} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2DC^{*}t}{N_1}}$$\nFrom this expression, we observe that the oxide thickness is directly proportional to the square root of the oxidant concentration at the surface, $C^{*}$:\n$$x(t) \\propto \\sqrt{C^{*}}$$\n\nWe are asked to compare two cases for determining $C^{*}$:\n$1$. **Ideal Gas Assumption:** The fugacity $f$ is equal to the pressure $p$. The oxidant concentration, which we denote $C^{*}_{ideal}$, is given by Henry's law as $C^{*}_{ideal} = H p$. The corresponding oxide thickness is $x_{ideal}(t)$.\n$2$. **Real Gas Correction:** The fugacity $f$ is given by $f = \\phi p \\approx Zp$. The oxidant concentration, $C^{*}_{real}$, is $C^{*}_{real} = H f = H(\\phi p) \\approx H(Zp)$. The corresponding oxide thickness is $x_{real}(t)$. This is considered the more accurate, or \"true,\" value.\n\nUsing the proportionality $x(t) \\propto \\sqrt{C^{*}}$, we can write the ratio of the ideal-case thickness to the real-case thickness:\n$$\\frac{x_{ideal}(t)}{x_{real}(t)} = \\frac{\\sqrt{C^{*}_{ideal}}}{\\sqrt{C^{*}_{real}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{H p}{H f}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{p}{f}}$$\nThe problem states that all other quantities ($D$, $N_1$, $H$, etc.) are unchanged.\n\nThe relative error, $\\epsilon$, incurred by using the ideal gas approximation is defined as the difference between the approximate value ($x_{ideal}$) and the true value ($x_{real}$), divided by the true value:\n$$\\epsilon = \\frac{x_{ideal}(t) - x_{real}(t)}{x_{real}(t)} = \\frac{x_{ideal}(t)}{x_{real}(t)} - 1$$\nSubstituting our previous result for the ratio of thicknesses:\n$$\\epsilon = \\sqrt{\\frac{p}{f}} - 1$$\nNow, we use the given relationships for fugacity: $f = \\phi p$ and the approximation $\\phi \\approx Z$.\n$$\\epsilon \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{p}{Zp}} - 1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{Z}} - 1 = Z^{-1/2} - 1$$\nThis derived expression gives the relative error in oxide thickness purely as a function of the compressibility factor, $Z$. Notably, the result is independent of pressure $p$, temperature, time $t$, and material-specific constants under the specified long-time, diffusion-limited conditions.\n\nFinally, we evaluate this error using the given value $Z = 0.9$.\n$$\\epsilon \\approx (0.9)^{-1/2} - 1$$\nCalculation:\n$$(0.9)^{-1/2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{0.9}} \\approx \\frac{1}{0.948683298} \\approx 1.05409255...$$\n$$\\epsilon \\approx 1.05409255 - 1 = 0.05409255...$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\\epsilon \\approx 0.05409$$\nThis positive error indicates that the ideal gas assumption overestimates the oxide thickness by approximately $5.41\\%$.",

The derivation must originate from the provided fundamental principles: Fick's first law, Henry's law, and interfacial reaction kinetics.\n\nThe physical model is based on the transport of an oxidant species from the furnace ambient, through the growing oxide layer, to the silicon-oxide interface where it reacts to form new oxide. We adopt a quasi-steady-state approximation, which assumes that the oxidant concentration profile in the oxide adjusts instantaneously to changes at the boundaries. This is a valid assumption because the diffusion timescale within the thin oxide layer is much shorter than the timescale of oxide growth.\n\nUnder this approximation, the oxidant flux, $J$, is constant throughout the oxide layer for any given instant in time. Let the coordinate $x$ be normal to the surface, with $x=0$ at the gas/oxide interface and $x=x_{ox}$ at the oxide/silicon interface, where $x_{ox}(t)$ is the oxide thickness at time $t$.\n\nFrom Fick's first law, $J = -D \\frac{dC}{dx}$. Since $J$ and the diffusivity $D$ are constant with respect to position $x$, the concentration gradient $\\frac{dC}{dx}$ must also be constant. This implies a linear concentration profile. We can therefore write the flux in terms of the concentrations at the two interfaces:\n$$J = D \\frac{C^* - C_i}{x_{ox}}$$\nwhere $C^*$ is the oxidant concentration at the gas/oxide interface ($x=0$) and $C_i$ is the oxidant concentration at the oxide/silicon interface ($x=x_{ox}$).\n\nThe boundary concentrations are determined by the other two principles.\n1.  At the gas/oxide interface ($x=0$), Henry's law states that the oxidant concentration in the oxide is in equilibrium with the gas-phase partial pressure $p(t)$.\n    $$C^*(t) = H p(t)$$\n    where $H$ is the Henry's law constant.\n\n2.  At the oxide/silicon interface ($x=x_{ox}$), the oxidant is consumed by a chemical reaction. The rate of this reaction, and thus the flux, is given by the first-order kinetics:\n    $$J = k_s^{\\text{eff}} C_i$$\n    where $k_s^{\\text{eff}}$ is the effective interfacial reaction rate constant. As specified, $k_s^{\\text{eff}}$ depends on a baseline constant $k_{s0}$, an orientation factor $f_{\\text{orient}}$, and the mean surface curvature $\\kappa$ via the relation $k_s^{\\text{eff}} = k_{s0} f_{\\text{orient}} (1 + \\alpha \\kappa)$.\n\nWe now have a system of two equations for the two unknowns, $J$ and $C_i$. We can solve this system to express the flux $J$ in terms of the known parameters and the current oxide thickness $x_{ox}$. From the reaction kinetics equation, we have $C_i = J / k_s^{\\text{eff}}$. Substituting this into the diffusion equation gives:\n$$J = D \\frac{C^* - (J / k_s^{\\text{eff}})}{x_{ox}}$$\nSolving for $J$:\n$$J x_{ox} = D C^* - \\frac{D J}{k_s^{\\text{eff}}}$$\n$$J \\left( x_{ox} + \\frac{D}{k_s^{\\text{eff}}} \\right) = D C^*$$\n$$J = \\frac{D C^*}{x_{ox} + D/k_s^{\\text{eff}}} = \\frac{C^*}{x_{ox}/D + 1/k_s^{\\text{eff}}}$$\n\nThe growth of the oxide layer is governed by mass conservation. The rate of increase in oxide thickness, $\\frac{dx_{ox}}{dt}$, is equal to the flux of oxidant arriving at the interface, $J$, divided by the number of moles of oxidant, $N_1$, required to form a unit volume of oxide.\n$$\\frac{dx_{ox}}{dt} = \\frac{J}{N_1}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $J$ yields the differential equation for oxide growth. Let us denote the thickness $x_{ox}$ simply by $x$:\n$$\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{1}{N_1} \\frac{C^*}{x/D + 1/k_s^{\\text{eff}}}$$\nThe problem describes a process with a piecewise-constant pressure schedule. For a single segment of duration $\\Delta t$, the pressure $p$ is constant. Consequently, $C^* = H p$ is also constant. All other parameters ($D$, $k_s^{\\text{eff}}$, $N_1$) are constant for a given test case. This allows us to solve the differential equation by separation of variables.\n$$\\left(\\frac{x}{D} + \\frac{1}{k_s^{\\text{eff}}}\\right) dx = \\frac{C^*}{N_1} dt$$\nWe integrate this equation over a time interval from $t=0$ to $t=\\Delta t$, during which the oxide thickness grows from an initial value $x_0$ to a final value $x_f$:\n$$\\int_{x_0}^{x_f} \\left(\\frac{x}{D} + \\frac{1}{k_s^{\\text{eff}}}\\right) dx = \\int_{0}^{\\Delta t} \\frac{C^*}{N_1} dt'$$\nThe integration yields:\n$$\\left[ \\frac{x^2}{2D} + \\frac{x}{k_s^{\\text{eff}}} \\right]_{x_0}^{x_f} = \\frac{C^* \\Delta t}{N_1}$$\n$$\\left( \\frac{x_f^2}{2D} + \\frac{x_f}{k_s^{\\text{eff}}} \\right) - \\left( \\frac{x_0^2}{2D} + \\frac{x_0}{k_s^{\\text{eff}}} \\right) = \\frac{C^* \\Delta t}{N_1}$$\nThis equation relates the final thickness $x_f$ to the initial thickness $x_0$ and the process conditions for the segment. To find $x_f$, we can solve this quadratic equation. It is conventional to define the Deal-Grove parameters $A$ and $B$:\n$$A = \\frac{2D}{k_s^{\\text{eff}}}$$\n$$B = \\frac{2DC^*}{N_1} = \\frac{2DHp}{N_1}$$\nMultiplying the integrated equation by $2D$ gives:\n$$x_f^2 + \\left(\\frac{2D}{k_s^{\\text{eff}}}\\right)x_f - \\left( x_0^2 + \\left(\\frac{2D}{k_s^{\\text{eff}}}\\right)x_0 + \\frac{2DC^*\\Delta t}{N_1} \\right) = 0$$\n$$x_f^2 + A x_f - (x_0^2 + A x_0 + B \\Delta t) = 0$$\nApplying the quadratic formula for $x_f$ and choosing the positive root (since thickness cannot be negative), we get:\n$$x_f = \\frac{-A + \\sqrt{A^2 + 4(x_0^2 + A x_0 + B \\Delta t)}}{2}$$\nA numerically more stable equivalent form is derived by noting that $A^2 + 4(x_0^2 + A x_0) = A^2 + 4Ax_0 + 4x_0^2 = (A + 2x_0)^2$. This leads to the final solution for a single segment:\n$$x_f = \\frac{-A + \\sqrt{(A + 2x_0)^2 + 4B \\Delta t}}{2}$$\n\nTo solve the problem for a sequence of pressure segments, we apply this formula iteratively. The final thickness from one segment becomes the initial thickness for the next. The overall algorithm is as follows:\n1.  Initialize the current oxide thickness, $x_{current}$, to the given initial value, $x_0$.\n2.  For a given test case, calculate the parameters that are constant throughout the process:\n    a. Determine the mean curvature, $\\kappa$. For a planar surface ($R = +\\infty$), $\\kappa = 0$. For a sphere of radius $R$, $\\kappa = 1/R$.\n    b. Determine the orientation multiplier, $f_{\\text{orient}}$.\n    c. Calculate the effective reaction rate constant, $k_s^{\\text{eff}} = k_{s0} f_{\\text{orient}} (1 + \\alpha \\kappa)$.\n    d. Calculate the parameter $A = 2D/k_s^{\\text{eff}}$. This parameter is constant for the entire test case.\n3.  Iterate through each $(\\Delta t, p)$ segment in the schedule:\n    a. Let the initial thickness for the current segment be $x_{seg,0} = x_{current}$.\n    b. If the pressure $p=0$, then $C^*=0$ and thus $B=0$. The growth equation shows $\\frac{dx}{dt}=0$, so there is no change in thickness. The final thickness for the segment is $x_{seg,f} = x_{seg,0}$.\n    c. If pressure $p > 0$, calculate the segment-specific parameter $B = \\frac{2DHp}{N_1}$.\n    d. Calculate the final thickness for the segment, $x_{seg,f}$, using the derived formula: $x_{seg,f} = \\frac{-A + \\sqrt{(A + 2x_{seg,0})^2 + 4B \\Delta t}}{2}$.\n    e. Update the current thickness: $x_{current} = x_{seg,f}$.\n4.  After processing all segments, the final value of $x_{current}$ is the total oxide thickness in meters. Convert this value to micrometers by multiplying by $10^6$ and format as required.",
