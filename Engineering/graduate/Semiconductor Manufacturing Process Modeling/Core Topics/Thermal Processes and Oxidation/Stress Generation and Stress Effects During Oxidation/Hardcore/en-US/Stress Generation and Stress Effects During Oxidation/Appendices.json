This practice guides you through the essential task of inverting this relationship, turning a series of curvature measurements taken during wafer cool-down into a quantitative story about stress evolution. By implementing an algorithm based on Stoney’s equation and thermoelasticity, you will learn to decompose the total measured stress into its distinct thermal and intrinsic (growth) components, a critical skill for process diagnostics and model validation .",

            "problem": "Consider a thin dielectric film grown on a much thicker crystalline substrate during thermal oxidation. After growth at a high deposition temperature, the wafer is cooled down. As the structure cools, differential thermal contraction and any growth-induced residual stress together drive an in-plane equi-biaxial film stress that bends the substrate. A well-established wafer curvature–film stress relation (Stoney’s relation) connects substrate curvature to the average in-plane film stress under the thin-film/thick-substrate assumption. Your task is to use a measured curvature history to reconstruct the evolving film stress during cool-down and then decompose it into thermal and growth components using known temperature-dependent coefficients of thermal expansion.\n\nFundamental base for modeling:\n- Use linear thermoelasticity for an equi-biaxially constrained thin film on a thick substrate, plane-stress in the film, and small-strain kinematics.\n- The thermal strain of a material over a temperature change from $T_1$ to $T_2$ is the integral of its coefficient of thermal expansion, $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{th}}(T_2; T_1) = \\int_{T_1}^{T_2} \\alpha(T)\\,\\mathrm{d}T$.\n- The stress induced in the film by thermal mismatch between film and substrate when constrained equi-biaxially is given by the biaxial modulus of the film multiplying the mismatch strain, and grows with the difference of the two thermal strains accumulated during cooling.\n- Use the classical thin-film curvature–stress relationship for a film on a thick substrate (do not explicitly write or assume any shortcut variants).\n\nStress decomposition objective:\n- Let the total in-plane film stress be $\\sigma_f(T)$ during cool-down from the deposition temperature $T_{\\mathrm{dep}}$ down to ambient temperature $T_{\\mathrm{amb}}$. Assume this decomposes additively as $\\sigma_f(T) = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{g}} + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{th}}(T)$, where $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{g}}$ is the growth-induced residual stress (assumed temperature-independent during post-growth cool-down) and $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{th}}(T)$ is the thermal mismatch stress.\n- Given measured curvature history $k(t)$ recorded during cool-down with corresponding temperature history $T(t)$, invert the curvature–stress relation to estimate $\\sigma_f(T)$ at each recorded time point. Then compute $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{th}}(T)$ using known functions $\\alpha_f(T)$ and $\\alpha_s(T)$ for the film and substrate, respectively, and finally estimate $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{g}}$.\n\nNumerical and unit requirements:\n- All physical quantities must be treated in the International System of Units (SI). Use thicknesses in $\\mathrm{m}$, moduli in $\\mathrm{Pa}$, curvature in $\\mathrm{m}^{-1}$, and temperature in $\\mathrm{K}$. Express final answers in $\\mathrm{GPa}$ rounded to six decimal places.\n- Angle units are not involved.\n- There are no percentage outputs.\n\nAlgorithmic design specification:\n- For each recorded temperature $T_i$ during cool-down, compute the thermal mismatch strain $\\epsilon_{\\Delta}(T_i) = \\int_{T_i}^{T_{\\mathrm{dep}}} \\left[\\alpha_f(T') - \\alpha_s(T')\\right]\\,\\mathrm{d}T'$. Then $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{th}}(T_i) = M_f\\,\\epsilon_{\\Delta}(T_i)$, where $M_f = \\dfrac{E_f}{1 - \\nu_f}$ is the film biaxial modulus with film Young’s modulus $E_f$ and Poisson’s ratio $\\nu_f$.\n- Invert the curvature relation to obtain $\\sigma_f(T_i)$ from each $k(T_i)$ using the substrate elastic properties and thicknesses provided. Then estimate $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{g}}$ as the mean of $\\sigma_f(T_i) - \\sigma_{\\mathrm{th}}(T_i)$ over all recorded points in the cool-down history.\n\nTest suite:\nProvide a program that evaluates the following three test cases.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been critically validated and is deemed to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard problem in thin-film mechanics, providing all necessary parameters and a clear algorithmic specification. The task involves a consistency check where a forward model generates synthetic data (curvature history), which is then processed by an inverse model to recover the initial parameters. This procedure is sound and allows for a unique, verifiable solution.\n\nThe solution is developed by first establishing the theoretical framework based on linear thermoelasticity and then implementing the specified two-stage algorithmic procedure: forward modeling to generate curvature data, followed by inverse modeling to perform stress decomposition.\n\n**Theoretical Framework**\n\nThe analysis rests on several key principles of continuum mechanics applied to thin films.\n\n1.  **Stress Decomposition**: The total in-plane equi-biaxial stress in the film, $\\sigma_f(T)$, at a given temperature $T$ during cool-down is assumed to be an additive superposition of a temperature-independent growth stress, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{g}}$, and a temperature-dependent thermal stress, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{th}}(T)$:\n    $$\n    \\sigma_f(T) = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{g}} + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{th}}(T)\n    $$\n    Here, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{g}}$ is the stress locked in at the growth temperature $T_{\\mathrm{dep}}$ due to the film deposition process itself. $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{th}}(T)$ arises from the differential thermal contraction between the film and the substrate as the system cools from $T_{\\mathrm{dep}}$. By convention, stress is positive for tension and negative for compression.\n\n2.  **Thermal Stress**: The thermal stress is a consequence of the mechanical constraint imposed by the thick substrate on the film. If unconstrained, the film would contract by a thermal strain $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{th},f}$ and the substrate by $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{th},s}$. The thermal strain accumulated between two temperatures $T_1$ and $T_2$ is given by the integral of the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), $\\alpha(T)$:\n    $$\n    \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{th}}(T_2; T_1) = \\int_{T_1}^{T_2} \\alpha(T')\\,\\mathrm{d}T'\n    $$\n    During cool-down from $T_{\\mathrm{dep}}$ to a lower temperature $T_i$, the mismatch in free contraction between the film and substrate generates a strain in the film, $\\epsilon_{\\Delta}(T_i)$:\n    $$\n    \\epsilon_{\\Delta}(T_i) = \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{th},s}(T_i; T_{\\mathrm{dep}}) - \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{th},f}(T_i; T_{\\mathrm{dep}}) = \\int_{T_{\\mathrm{dep}}}^{T_i} \\left[ \\alpha_s(T') - \\alpha_f(T') \\right]\\,\\mathrm{d}T' = \\int_{T_i}^{T_{\\mathrm{dep}}} \\left[ \\alpha_f(T') - \\alpha_s(T') \\right]\\,\\mathrm{d}T'\n    $$\n    For an equi-biaxially strained film (plane stress condition, $\\sigma_{zz}=0$), the in-plane thermal stress is related to this mismatch strain by the film's biaxial modulus, $M_f$:\n    $$\n    \\sigma_{\\mathrm{th}}(T_i) = M_f \\cdot \\epsilon_{\\Delta}(T_i)\n    $$\n    where $M_f = \\frac{E_f}{1 - \\nu_f}$, with $E_f$ being the Young's modulus and $\\nu_f$ the Poisson's ratio of the film.\n\n3.  **Stoney's Equation**: The in-plane stress in a thin film causes the much thicker substrate to bend. For a film of thickness $t_f$ on a substrate of thickness $t_s$ (where $t_f \\ll t_s$), the relationship between the average film stress $\\sigma_f$ and the substrate curvature $k$ is given by the classical Stoney's equation:\n    $$\n    k = \\frac{6 \\sigma_f t_f}{M_s t_s^2}\n    $$\n    where $M_s = \\frac{E_s}{1 - \\nu_s}$ is the biaxial modulus of the substrate. This relation is central to both the forward and inverse parts of our problem.\n\n**Algorithmic Procedure**\n\nThe solution is implemented in two main stages as specified.\n\n**Stage 1: Forward Model (Generation of Curvature History)**\n\nThis stage simulates the physical process to generate a synthetic but physically consistent curvature history, $k(T_i)$, for a given set of material properties and a true growth stress, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{g,true}}$. For each temperature $T_i$ in the discrete cool-down path from $T_{\\mathrm{dep}}$ to $T_{\\mathrm{amb}}$:\n\n1.  **Compute Thermal Mismatch Strain $\\epsilon_{\\Delta}(T_i)$**: The CTEs, $\\alpha_f(T)$ and $\\alpha_s(T)$, are given as linear functions of temperature, $\\alpha(T) = C_1 + C_2(T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}})$. The difference, $\\Delta\\alpha(T) = \\alpha_f(T) - \\alpha_s(T)$, is also a linear function. The integral for $\\epsilon_{\\Delta}(T_i)$ can be solved analytically:\n    $$\n    \\epsilon_{\\Delta}(T_i) = \\int_{T_i}^{T_{\\mathrm{dep}}} \\left[ \\Delta C_1 + \\Delta C_2 (T' - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}) \\right]\\,\\mathrm{d}T' = \\left[ \\Delta C_1 T' + \\Delta C_2 \\left(\\frac{T'^2}{2} - T_{\\mathrm{ref}}T'\\right) \\right]_{T_i}^{T_{\\mathrm{dep}}}\n    $$\n2.  **Compute Thermal Stress $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{th}}(T_i)$**: Calculate the film's biaxial modulus $M_f$ and then the thermal stress using $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{th}}(T_i) = M_f \\cdot \\epsilon_{\\Delta}(T_i)$.\n3.  **Compute Total Stress $\\sigma_f(T_i)$**: The total stress is the sum of the true growth stress and the calculated thermal stress: $\\sigma_f(T_i) = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{g,true}} + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{th}}(T_i)$.\n4.  **Compute Curvature $k(T_i)$**: With the total stress $\\sigma_f(T_i)$ known, calculate the substrate's biaxial modulus $M_s$ and use Stoney's equation to find the corresponding curvature: $k(T_i) = \\frac{6 \\sigma_f(T_i) t_f}{M_s t_s^2}$.\n\nThis process is repeated for all temperature points to create the \"measured\" dataset $\\{T_i, k(T_i)\\}$.\n\n**Stage 2: Inverse Model (Stress Decomposition)**\n\nThis stage mimics the analysis of experimental data. Using the generated curvature history $\\{T_i, k(T_i)\\}$ and the known material properties, we perform the stress decomposition.\n\n1.  **Estimate Total Stress $\\sigma_{f,\\mathrm{est}}(T_i)$**: For each temperature $T_i$, invert Stoney's equation to find the total film stress from the \"measured\" curvature:\n    $$\n    \\sigma_{f,\\mathrm{est}}(T_i) = \\frac{k(T_i) M_s t_s^2}{6 t_f}\n    $$\n    Since no noise is introduced, $\\sigma_{f,\\mathrm{est}}(T_i)$ will be identical to $\\sigma_f(T_i)$ from the forward model.\n2.  **Calculate Theoretical Thermal Stress $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{th}}(T_i)$**: This step is identical to step 1 and 2 in the forward model, recalculating the thermal stress for each $T_i$ based on the given CTEs.\n3.  **Estimate Growth Stress $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{g}}^{\\mathrm{est}}$**: For each temperature point $T_i$, an estimate of the growth stress is obtained by subtracting the thermal component from the total stress: $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{g,est}}(T_i) = \\sigma_{f,\\mathrm{est}}(T_i) - \\sigma_{\\mathrm{th}}(T_i)$. Because the models are perfectly consistent, each $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{g,est}}(T_i)$ will be equal to $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{g,true}}$. The final estimate, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{g}}^{\\mathrm{est}}$, is the mean of these individual estimates over all temperature points. Due to their uniformity, the mean is simply $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{g,true}}$.\n4.  **Determine Final Quantities**: The required outputs are:\n    -   $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{g}}^{\\mathrm{est}}$, the mean growth stress calculated in the previous step.\n    -   $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{th}}(T_{\\mathrm{amb}})$, the thermal stress at the final ambient temperature, $T_{\\mathrm{amb}}$.\n    -   $\\sigma_f(T_{\\mathrm{amb}})$, the total stress at the final ambient temperature, derived from $\\sigma_{f,\\mathrm{est}}(T_{\\mathrm{amb}})$ or by summing $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{g}}^{\\mathrm{est}} + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{th}}(T_{\\mathrm{amb}})$.\n\nAll calculations are performed in SI units ($\\mathrm{m}$, $\\mathrm{Pa}$, $\\mathrm{K}$), and the final results are converted to Gigapascals ($\\mathrm{GPa}$) and rounded to six decimal places, as required.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that the implemented program correctly models the physics and performs the required analysis to meet the problem specifications for all test cases.",

A detailed solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nLet the reaction rate at the Si/SiO$_2$ interface be $R$. According to the problem statement, the rate is proportional to an exponential term involving the activation free energy $\\Delta G^{\\dagger}$. We can write this as:\n$$\nR = C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\dagger}}{k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $C$ is a constant of proportionality that depends on factors such as reactant concentration but is independent of stress.\n\nThe activation free energy $\\Delta G^{\\dagger}$ is a function of the hydrostatic compressive stress $\\sigma$:\n$$\n\\Delta G^{\\dagger}(\\sigma) = \\Delta G^{\\dagger}(0) + \\Omega \\sigma\n$$\nHere, $\\Delta G^{\\dagger}(0)$ is the activation free energy at zero stress ($\\sigma=0$). Substituting this expression into the rate equation gives the stress-dependent reaction rate, $R(\\sigma)$:\n$$\nR(\\sigma) = C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\dagger}(0) + \\Omega \\sigma}{k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the property of exponents, $\\exp(a+b) = \\exp(a)\\exp(b)$, we can separate the terms:\n$$\nR(\\sigma) = C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\dagger}(0)}{k_{B}T}\\right) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Omega \\sigma}{k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\nThe reaction rate at zero stress, $R(0)$, is obtained by setting $\\sigma=0$:\n$$\nR(0) = C \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^{\\dagger}(0)}{k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\nBy substituting $R(0)$ back into the equation for $R(\\sigma)$, we obtain a simplified relationship between the rate at stress $\\sigma$ and the rate at zero stress:\n$$\nR(\\sigma) = R(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Omega \\sigma}{k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem requires finding the stress $\\sigma^{*}$ at which the reaction rate is reduced to one-half of its zero-stress value. This condition is formally expressed as:\n$$\nR(\\sigma^{*}) = \\frac{1}{2} R(0)\n$$\nSubstituting our expression for $R(\\sigma^{*})$:\n$$\nR(0) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Omega \\sigma^{*}}{k_{B}T}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} R(0)\n$$\nSince $R(0)$ is a non-zero rate, we can divide both sides by $R(0)$:\n$$\n\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Omega \\sigma^{*}}{k_{B}T}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nTo solve for $\\sigma^{*}$, we take the natural logarithm ($\\ln$) of both sides:\n$$\n\\ln\\left[\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Omega \\sigma^{*}}{k_{B}T}\\right)\\right] = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{\\Omega \\sigma^{*}}{k_{B}T} = -\\ln(2)\n$$\nMultiplying by $-1$ on both sides yields:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Omega \\sigma^{*}}{k_{B}T} = \\ln(2)\n$$\nFinally, we isolate $\\sigma^{*}$ to obtain the general symbolic condition:\n$$\n\\sigma^{*} = \\frac{k_{B} T \\ln(2)}{\\Omega}\n$$\nThis expression provides the hydrostatic compressive stress required to halve the interface reaction rate.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value for $\\sigma^{*}$ using the provided data:\n$T = 1150\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n$\\Omega = 1.9 \\times 10^{-29}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}$\n$k_{B} = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$\n\\sigma^{*} = \\frac{(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (1150\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\times \\ln(2)}{1.9 \\times 10^{-29}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}}\n$$\nFirst, calculate the thermal energy term $k_{B}T$:\n$$\nk_{B}T = (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}) \\times 1150 \\approx 1.58774635 \\times 10^{-20}\\,\\mathrm{J}\n$$\nNext, multiply by $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.69314718$:\n$$\nk_{B}T\\ln(2) \\approx (1.58774635 \\times 10^{-20}\\,\\mathrm{J}) \\times 0.69314718 \\approx 1.10041 \\times 10^{-20}\\,\\mathrm{J}\n$$\nNow, divide by the activation volume $\\Omega$:\n$$\n\\sigma^{*} \\approx \\frac{1.10041 \\times 10^{-20}\\,\\mathrm{J}}{1.9 \\times 10^{-29}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{3}} \\approx 5.7916 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-3}}\n$$\nThe unit $\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-3}}$ is equivalent to $\\mathrm{N\\,m\\,m^{-3}} = \\mathrm{N\\,m^{-2}}$, which is the Pascal ($\\mathrm{Pa}$), the SI unit of pressure and stress.

            "solution": "The problem is found to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM), well-posed with all necessary information provided for a unique solution, and stated in objective, formal language. The provided material properties and physical dimensions for a silicon dioxide film on a silicon substrate are consistent with established values in semiconductor process modeling and materials science.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of an expression for the critical stress for crack propagation, $\\sigma_{c}$, and the subsequent calculation of the ratio $R = \\sigma/\\sigma_{c}$, where $\\sigma$ is the existing tensile stress in the film.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for $\\sigma_{c}$. The fundamental concept in LEFM is the stress intensity factor, $K$, which characterizes the stress field at the tip of a crack. For a mode I (opening mode) crack under a uniform tensile stress $\\sigma$, $K$ is given by:\n$$K = Y \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a}$$\nwhere $a$ is the crack depth and $Y$ is a dimensionless geometry factor that depends on the specimen and crack geometry.\n\nThe criterion for crack propagation can be formulated in terms of energy. The strain energy release rate, $G$, represents the energy available per unit area of crack extension. For a linear elastic material, $G$ is related to the stress intensity factor $K$. Under plane strain conditions, which are specified for the film constrained by the substrate, this relationship is:\n$$G = \\frac{K^2}{E}(1 - \\nu^2)$$\nwhere $E$ is the Young's modulus and $\\nu$ is the Poisson's ratio.\n\nFracture, or unstable crack propagation, occurs when the strain energy release rate $G$ reaches a critical value, $G_{c}$, which is a material property known as the fracture energy or critical strain energy release rate. At this point, the applied stress is, by definition, the critical stress $\\sigma_{c}$. Therefore, we can write:\n$$G_{c} = \\frac{K_{c}^2}{E}(1 - \\nu^2)$$\nwhere $K_{c}$ is the critical stress intensity factor, or fracture toughness. $K_c$ is related to $\\sigma_c$ by the same geometry-dependent expression for $K$:\n$$K_{c} = Y \\sigma_{c} \\sqrt{\\pi a}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $K_{c}$ into the equation for $G_{c}$ yields:\n$$G_{c} = \\frac{(Y \\sigma_{c} \\sqrt{\\pi a})^2}{E}(1 - \\nu^2) = \\frac{Y^2 \\sigma_{c}^2 \\pi a}{E}(1 - \\nu^2)$$\nWe can now rearrange this equation to solve for the critical stress, $\\sigma_{c}$, which is the first part of the problem.\n$$\\sigma_{c}^2 = \\frac{E G_{c}}{Y^2 \\pi a (1 - \\nu^2)}$$\nTaking the square root gives the desired expression for the critical stress:\n$$\\sigma_{c} = \\frac{1}{Y} \\sqrt{\\frac{E G_{c}}{\\pi a (1 - \\nu^2)}}$$\nThis expression defines the critical stress required to propagate an edge crack of depth $a$ in the material.\n\nNext, we evaluate the numerical value of $\\sigma_{c}$ and the ratio $R$.
