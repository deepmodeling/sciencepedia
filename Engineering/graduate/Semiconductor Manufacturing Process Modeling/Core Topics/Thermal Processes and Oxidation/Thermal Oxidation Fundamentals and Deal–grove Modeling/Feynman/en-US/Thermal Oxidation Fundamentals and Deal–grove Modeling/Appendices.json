It is a standard, well-posed problem in semiconductor process modeling. I will proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\n**2. Derivation and Solution**\n\nThe derivation proceeds in three main steps: first, we determine the oxidant flux $J$ through the oxide layer; second, we relate this flux to the oxide growth rate to obtain a differential equation for the oxide thickness $x_{\\text{ox}}(t)$; third, we analyze the long-time asymptotic behavior of this equation.\n\nLet the spatial coordinate be $x$, with $x=0$ at the gas/oxide interface and $x=x_{\\text{ox}}(t)$ at the oxide/silicon interface. Let $C(x)$ be the concentration of the oxidant within the oxide layer.\n\nAccording to Fick's first law, the flux $J$ of the oxidant is proportional to the concentration gradient:\n$$J(x) = -D \\frac{\\mathrm{d}C(x)}{\\mathrm{d}x}$$\nThe problem states that the transport is quasi-steady. This implies that the flux $J$ is constant throughout the oxide layer for any given thickness $x_{\\text{ox}}$, i.e., $J(x)=J$. We can integrate Fick's law across the oxide layer from $x=0$ to $x=x_{\\text{ox}}$:\n$$\\int_{0}^{x_{\\text{ox}}} J \\, \\mathrm{d}x = \\int_{C(0)}^{C(x_{\\text{ox}})} -D \\, \\mathrm{d}C$$\n$$J x_{\\text{ox}} = -D [C(x_{\\text{ox}}) - C(0)] = D[C(0) - C(x_{\\text{ox}})]$$\n\nWe now apply the boundary conditions.\n1. At the gas/oxide interface ($x=0$), the oxidant concentration is assumed to be at its equilibrium solubility limit in the oxide, given as $C^*$. So, $C(0) = C^*$.\n2. At the oxide/silicon interface ($x=x_{\\text{ox}}$), the oxidant flux arriving at the interface is consumed by the reaction that forms new oxide. The problem states this is a first-order reaction with rate constant $k_s$. Therefore, the flux consumed is proportional to the oxidant concentration at the interface, $C_i \\equiv C(x_{\\text{ox}})$. The flux continuity condition requires that the diffusive flux equals the reaction flux:\n$$J = k_s C_i \\implies C_i = \\frac{J}{k_s}$$\n\nSubstituting these boundary conditions, $C(0)=C^*$ and $C(x_{\\text{ox}})=C_i=J/k_s$, into the integrated Fick's law:\n$$J x_{\\text{ox}} = D \\left( C^* - \\frac{J}{k_s} \\right)$$\nWe can now solve this algebraic equation for the flux $J$:\n$$J x_{\\text{ox}} + \\frac{D}{k_s} J = D C^*$$\n$$J \\left( x_{\\text{ox}} + \\frac{D}{k_s} \\right) = D C^*$$\n$$J = \\frac{D C^*}{x_{\\text{ox}} + D/k_s}$$\n\nThe problem provides the relationship between the oxidant flux $J$ and the rate of oxide growth $\\mathrm{d}x_{\\text{ox}}/\\mathrm{d}t$:\n$$N_1 \\frac{\\mathrm{d}x_{\\text{ox}}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = J$$\nwhere $N_1$ is the number of oxidant molecules incorporated into a unit volume of oxide. Substituting our expression for $J$ yields the differential equation for $x_{\\text{ox}}(t)$:\n$$N_1 \\frac{\\mathrm{d}x_{\\text{ox}}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{D C^*}{x_{\\text{ox}} + D/k_s}$$\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x_{\\text{ox}}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{D C^*/N_1}{x_{\\text{ox}} + D/k_s}$$\n\nThis equation is conventionally expressed in terms of the Deal-Grove rate constants $A$ and $B$. Let's define them based on their standard forms:\nThe parabolic rate constant is $B = \\frac{2 D C^*}{N_1}$.\nThe linear rate constant is given by the ratio $B/A = \\frac{k_s C^*}{N_1}$.\nFrom these definitions, we can find an expression for $A$:\n$$A = \\frac{B}{B/A} = \\frac{2 D C^* / N_1}{k_s C^* / N_1} = \\frac{2D}{k_s}$$\nUsing these definitions, we can express the terms in our growth rate equation:\n$D C^* / N_1 = B/2$\n$D/k_s = A/2$\n\nSubstituting these into the differential equation gives the standard form of the Deal-Grove model:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x_{\\text{ox}}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{B/2}{x_{\\text{ox}} + A/2} = \\frac{B}{2x_{\\text{ox}} + A}$$\nThis is the governing equation for the instantaneous growth rate.\n\nTo solve for $x_{\\text{ox}}(t)$, we separate variables and integrate, using the initial condition $x_{\\text{ox}}(0)=0$:\n$$\\int_{0}^{x_{\\text{ox}}} (2x'_{\\text{ox}} + A) \\, \\mathrm{d}x'_{\\text{ox}} = \\int_{0}^{t} B \\, \\mathrm{d}t'$$\n$$\\left[ (x'_{\\text{ox}})^2 + A x'_{\\text{ox}} \\right]_0^{x_{\\text{ox}}} = [Bt']_0^t$$\n$$x_{\\text{ox}}^2(t) + A x_{\\text{ox}}(t) = Bt$$\nThis is the implicit solution for the oxide thickness as a function of time.\n\nThe problem asks for the analysis of the long-time, diffusion-limited regime. This regime occurs when the oxide is thick, which happens at large times $t \\to \\infty$. In this limit, $x_{\\text{ox}}$ becomes large. In the growth rate equation $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x_{\\text{ox}}}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{B}{2x_{\\text{ox}} + A}$, the term $2x_{\\text{ox}}$ dominates the constant $A$ in the denominator. This corresponds to the growth being limited by diffusion through the thick oxide layer, hence \"diffusion-limited\".\nThus, for large $t$, the growth rate is asymptotically given by:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x_{\\text{ox}}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\approx \\frac{B}{2x_{\\text{ox}}}$$\nThis is the asymptotic differential equation. To find the time dependence of the growth rate, we first need the time dependence of the thickness $x_{\\text{ox}}(t)$ in this regime. From the integrated form $x_{\\text{ox}}^2 + A x_{\\text{ox}} = Bt$, for large $t$, the term $Bt$ is large. To balance the equation, $x_{\\text{ox}}$ must also be large. In this case, the $x_{\\text{ox}}^2$ term will dominate the $Ax_{\\text{ox}}$ term. The asymptotic relationship is:\n$$x_{\\text{ox}}^2(t) \\approx Bt \\implies x_{\\text{ox}}(t) \\approx \\sqrt{Bt}$$\nThis is the characteristic parabolic growth law for the diffusion-limited regime.\n\nNow, we substitute this asymptotic expression for $x_{\\text{ox}}(t)$ back into the asymptotic expression for the growth rate:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x_{\\text{ox}}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\approx \\frac{B}{2(\\sqrt{Bt})} = \\frac{B}{2\\sqrt{B}\\sqrt{t}}$$\nSimplifying this expression gives the leading-order asymptotic behavior of the instantaneous growth rate as a function of time:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x_{\\text{ox}}}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\approx \\frac{\\sqrt{B}}{2\\sqrt{t}}$$\nThis shows that in the long-time, diffusion-limited regime, the growth rate decays with time as $t^{-1/2}$.",

The problem statement is scientifically sound, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Growth Rate Differential Equation\n\nThe model considers one-dimensional diffusion of an oxidant through an existing silicon dioxide ($SiO_2$) layer of thickness $x(t)$ to react at the silicon-silicon dioxide ($Si$-$SiO_2$) interface.\n\n1.  **Oxidant Flux from Diffusion:** Fick's first law of diffusion in one dimension states that the flux $J$ is proportional to the concentration gradient:\n    $$J = -D \\frac{\\mathrm{d}C}{\\mathrm{d}y}$$\n    where $D$ is the diffusivity of the oxidant in the oxide, and $C(y)$ is the oxidant concentration at a position $y$ within the oxide ($0 \\le y \\le x$). The problem assumes a quasi-steady linear concentration profile. Given the boundary conditions $C(y=0) = C^*$ (the equilibrium concentration at the gas-oxide surface) and $C(y=x) = C_i$ (the concentration at the $Si$-$SiO_2$ interface), the linear gradient is constant:\n    $$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}C}{\\mathrm{d}y} = \\frac{C(x) - C(0)}{x - 0} = \\frac{C_i - C^*}{x}$$\n    Substituting this into Fick's law gives the flux of oxidant arriving at the interface:\n    $$J = -D \\left(\\frac{C_i - C^*}{x}\\right) = D \\frac{C^* - C_i}{x}$$\n\n2.  **Oxidant Flux from Reaction:** The problem specifies a first-order interfacial reaction, meaning the rate of consumption of the oxidant is proportional to its concentration at the interface, $C_i$. The flux consumed by the reaction is:\n    $$J = k_s C_i$$\n    where $k_s$ is the interfacial reaction rate constant.\n\n3.  **Quasi-Steady State Assumption:** Under the quasi-steady state assumption, the diffusion flux to the interface equals the reaction flux at the interface. Equating the two expressions for $J$:\n    $$D \\frac{C^* - C_i}{x} = k_s C_i$$\n    We can solve this for the unknown interface concentration, $C_i$:\n    $$D C^* - D C_i = k_s x C_i$$\n    $$D C^* = C_i (D + k_s x)$$\n    $$C_i = \\frac{D C^*}{D + k_s x}$$\n\n4.  **Oxide Growth Rate:** The rate of oxide growth, $\\mathrm{d}x/\\mathrm{d}t$, is proportional to the oxidant flux arriving at the interface. This relationship is defined by $N_1$, the number of oxidant molecules incorporated into a unit volume of oxide:\n    $$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{J}{N_1}$$\n    Substituting the expression for $J = k_s C_i$ and then the expression for $C_i$:\n    $$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{k_s C_i}{N_1} = \\frac{k_s}{N_1} \\left( \\frac{D C^*}{D + k_s x} \\right)$$\n    This can be expressed as the requested rational function of $x$:\n    $$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{k_s D C^*}{N_1 (D + k_s x)}$$\n    This is the first-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation for the oxide thickness $x(t)$.\n\n### Part 2: Integration and the Time Offset $\\tau$\n\nTo integrate the ODE, it is conventional to define the Deal-Grove rate constants. Let the parabolic rate constant be $B = \\frac{2DC^*}{N_1}$ and a related constant be $A = \\frac{2D}{k_s}$. The linear rate constant is typically given by $B/A = k_s C^*/N_1$. Using $A$ and $B$, the ODE can be rewritten as:\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} = \\frac{B/A}{1 + 2x/A} = \\frac{B/A}{(A+2x)/A} = \\frac{B}{2x + A}$$\nTo solve this ODE, we separate variables:\n$$(2x + A) \\mathrm{d}x = B \\mathrm{d}t$$\nWe integrate this equation from the initial condition $(t=0, x=x_0)$ to a later state $(t, x(t))$:\n$$\\int_{x_0}^{x} (2x' + A) \\mathrm{d}x' = \\int_{0}^{t} B \\mathrm{d}t'$$\n$$[x'^2 + Ax']_{x_0}^{x} = [Bt']_{0}^{t}$$\n$$(x^2 + Ax) - (x_0^2 + Ax_0) = Bt$$\nRearranging this gives the well-known integrated form of the Deal-Grove model:\n$$x^2 + Ax = B t + (x_0^2 + Ax_0)$$\nThis equation can be written more compactly as $x^2 + Ax = B(t + \\tau)$, where the effective time offset, $\\tau$, is defined as:\n$$\\tau = \\frac{x_0^2 + Ax_0}{B}$$\n**Physical Meaning of $\\tau$**: The parameter $\\tau$ represents the time that would have been required, under the same oxidation conditions, to grow the pre-existing oxide layer of thickness $x_0$ starting from a bare silicon surface ($x=0$). It effectively shifts the time origin of the process to account for the initial oxide.\n**Influence of not including $\\tau$**: If one attempts to fit experimental data $(t_j, x_j)$ from a sample with a non-zero initial thickness $x_0$ to the simplified model $x^2 + Ax = Bt$ (which implicitly assumes $\\tau=0$), the model is misspecified. The term $B\\tau = x_0^2 + Ax_0$ is a non-zero intercept in the relationship between $x^2+Ax$ and $t$. Forcing this intercept to be zero during parameter extraction will lead to systematic errors in the determined values of $A$ and $B$, which will no longer accurately reflect the underlying physical rate constants.\n\n### Part 3: Linear Regression Model and Parameter Extraction\n\nThe integrated form of the Deal-Grove model, $x^2 + Ax = B(t + \\tau)$, can be rearranged for linear regression.\n$$x^2 + Ax = Bt + B\\tau$$\n$$x^2 = -Ax + Bt + B\\tau$$\nAs requested, we define the regression variables $y = x^2$, $u = -x$, and $v = t$. The target linear model is $y = \\alpha u + \\beta v + \\gamma$. Substituting the variables into this model gives:\n$$x^2 = \\alpha(-x) + \\beta(t) + \\gamma \\implies x^2 = -\\alpha x + \\beta t + \\gamma$$\nBy comparing this regression equation term-by-term with the physical equation $x^2 = -Ax + Bt + B\\tau$, we can identify the relationships between the regression coefficients $(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma)$ and the physical parameters $(A, B, \\tau)$:\n-   Comparing the terms linear in $x$: $-A = -\\alpha \\implies A = \\alpha$.\n-   Comparing the terms linear in $t$: $B = \\beta$.\n-   Comparing the constant terms (intercepts): $B\\tau = \\gamma$.\n\nFrom a linear least squares fit that yields the coefficients $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\gamma$, we can extract the physical parameters as follows:\n1.  **Linear Rate Constant Parameter $A$**: This is directly obtained from the regression coefficient $\\alpha$.\n    $$A = \\alpha$$\n    The units of $y=x^2$ are $\\mathrm{nm}^2$ and the units of $u=-x$ are $\\mathrm{nm}$. For the term $\\alpha u$ to have units of $\\mathrm{nm}^2$, $\\alpha$ must have units of $\\mathrm{nm}$.\n\n2.  **Parabolic Rate Constant $B$**: This is directly obtained from the regression coefficient $\\beta$.\n    $$B = \\beta$$\n    The units of $y=x^2$ are $\\mathrm{nm}^2$ and the units of $v=t$ are $\\mathrm{min}$. For the term $\\beta v$ to have units of $\\mathrm{nm}^2$, $\\beta$ must have units of $\\mathrm{nm}^2/\\mathrm{min}$.\n\n3.  **Effective Time Offset $\\tau$**: This is obtained from $\\gamma$ and the now-known $B$.\n    $$\\tau = \\frac{\\gamma}{B} = \\frac{\\gamma}{\\beta}$$\n    The constant term $\\gamma$ has the same units as $y$, which is $\\mathrm{nm}^2$. Therefore, the units of $\\tau$ are $(\\mathrm{nm}^2) / (\\mathrm{nm}^2/\\mathrm{min}) = \\mathrm{min}$.\n\nThis formulation allows for the robust extraction of the three key parameters of the Deal-Grove model ($A$, $B$, and $\\tau$) from experimental data points $(t_j, x_j)$ by applying standard multivariate linear regression.",
