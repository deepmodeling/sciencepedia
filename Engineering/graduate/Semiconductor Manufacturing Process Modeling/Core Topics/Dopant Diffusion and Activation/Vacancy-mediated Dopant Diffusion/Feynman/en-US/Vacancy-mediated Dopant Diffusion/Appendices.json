Macroscopic diffusion is the result of countless individual atomic jumps, and the geometry of the crystal lattice dictates the rules for these jumps. This first practice challenges you to derive key parameters for a random walk on the diamond cubic lattice, connecting the microscopic jump distance and coordination number to the geometric factor that appears in the diffusion coefficient . By working from first principles of crystallography, you will build a foundational understanding of how crystal structure governs transport phenomena.",

            "problem": "A substitutional dopant in diamond cubic silicon moves by exchanging positions with a neighboring vacancy. Consider the dilute, thermally activated vacancy regime such that only nearest-neighbor vacancy–dopant exchanges contribute. Model the diffusion as an isotropic three-dimensional (3D) random walk on the diamond lattice, and treat each symmetry-equivalent nearest-neighbor exchange pathway as having the same per-neighbor jump frequency. Use only the geometry of the diamond cubic lattice with conventional cubic lattice parameter $a$ to determine the following, starting from first principles about the lattice basis and nearest-neighbor connectivity:\n\n1) Identify the set of symmetry-inequivalent nearest-neighbor substitutional sites accessible by a single vacancy–dopant exchange from a given substitutional site, and determine the coordination number $z$ (the number of symmetry-equivalent nearest-neighbor exchange pathways).\n\n2) Determine the dopant jump distance $r$ for a single nearest-neighbor vacancy–dopant exchange.\n\n3) Using the concept that the uncorrelated three-dimensional random walk diffusion coefficient can be written as a per-neighbor jump frequency multiplied by a geometric factor with dimensions of length squared, compute this geometric factor $G$ that depends only on $a$ and the lattice geometry. Your final answer should be the closed-form analytic expression for $G$ in terms of $a$ only.\n\nExpress the final answer for $G$ in terms of $a$ (with $a$ measured in meters). No numerical evaluation is required, and no rounding is needed. The final answer must be a single closed-form expression.",
            "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of dopant diffusion on a diamond cubic lattice, modeled as a nearest-neighbor random walk. We must first establish the geometric properties of this lattice, specifically the coordination number and nearest-neighbor distance, and then use these properties to derive the geometric factor for the diffusion coefficient.\n\nThe diamond cubic lattice can be described as a face-centered cubic (FCC) Bravais lattice with a two-atom basis. The conventional cubic cell has a side length of $a$. We can place the FCC lattice points at positions $\\vec{R}_{FCC} = n_1 \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{y}+\\hat{z}) + n_2 \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{x}+\\hat{z}) + n_3 \\frac{a}{2}(\\hat{x}+\\hat{y})$ for integers $n_1, n_2, n_3$. A more convenient representation uses Cartesian coordinates where the FCC lattice sites are at $(i,j,k)\\frac{a}{2}$ such that $i+j+k$ is an even integer. The two-atom basis consists of one atom at position $\\vec{d}_1 = (0,0,0)$ and a second atom at position $\\vec{d}_2 = \\frac{a}{4}(\\hat{x}+\\hat{y}+\\hat{z})$ relative to each FCC lattice point. The atoms of the crystal are thus located at positions $\\vec{R}_{FCC} + \\vec{d}_1$ and $\\vec{R}_{FCC} + \\vec{d}_2$. This forms two interpenetrating FCC sublattices. An atom on one sublattice is nearest-neighbors only with atoms on the other sublattice.\n\n**1) Coordination Number ($z$) and Symmetry of Nearest Neighbors**\n\nTo determine the coordination number $z$ and the jump distance $r$, we can find the shortest distance between an atom on one sublattice and all atoms on the other sublattice. For simplicity, let's consider a dopant atom located at a site on the second sublattice, at position $\\vec{P} = \\vec{d}_2 = \\frac{a}{4}(\\hat{x}+\\hat{y}+\\hat{z})$. Its nearest neighbors will be atoms from the first sublattice, whose positions are given by the FCC lattice vectors $\\vec{R}_{FCC}$. The displacement vector from our chosen atom to a potential neighbor is $\\vec{j} = \\vec{R}_{FCC} - \\vec{P} = \\vec{R}_{FCC} - \\frac{a}{4}(\\hat{x}+\\hat{y}+\\hat{z})$. We must find the vectors $\\vec{R}_{FCC}$ that minimize the magnitude $|\\vec{j}|$.\n\nThe FCC lattice points closest to the position $\\vec{P}$ are:\n- $\\vec{R}_1 = (0,0,0)$. The displacement is $\\vec{j}_1 = (0,0,0) - \\frac{a}{4}(1,1,1) = -\\frac{a}{4}(1,1,1)$.\n- $\\vec{R}_2 = \\frac{a}{2}(1,1,0)$. The displacement is $\\vec{j}_2 = \\frac{a}{2}(1,1,0) - \\frac{a}{4}(1,1,1) = \\frac{a}{4}(1,1,-1)$.\n- $\\vec{R}_3 = \\frac{a}{2}(1,0,1)$. The displacement is $\\vec{j}_3 = \\frac{a}{2}(1,0,1) - \\frac{a}{4}(1,1,1) = \\frac{a}{4}(1,-1,1)$.\n- $\\vec{R}_4 = \\frac{a}{2}(0,1,1)$. The displacement is $\\vec{j}_4 = \\frac{a}{2}(0,1,1) - \\frac{a}{4}(1,1,1) = \\frac{a}{4}(-1,1,1)$.\n\nLet's compute the squared magnitude for these displacement vectors:\n$|\\vec{j}_1|^2 = \\left(-\\frac{a}{4}\\right)^2 (1^2+1^2+1^2) = \\frac{a^2}{16}(3) = \\frac{3a^2}{16}$.\n$|\\vec{j}_2|^2 = \\left(\\frac{a}{4}\\right)^2 (1^2+1^2+(-1)^2) = \\frac{a^2}{16}(3) = \\frac{3a^2}{16}$.\n$|\\vec{j}_3|^2 = \\left(\\frac{a}{4}\\right)^2 (1^2+(-1)^2+1^2) = \\frac{a^2}{16}(3) = \\frac{3a^2}{16}$.\n$|\\vec{j}_4|^2 = \\left(\\frac{a}{4}\\right)^2 ((-1)^2+1^2+1^2) = \\frac{a^2}{16}(3) = \\frac{3a^2}{16}$.\n\nAny other FCC lattice point, such as $\\vec{R}_{FCC} = (a,0,0)$, yields a larger distance. For example, $\\vec{j} = (a,0,0) - \\frac{a}{4}(1,1,1) = \\frac{a}{4}(3,-1,-1)$, which has a squared magnitude of $\\frac{a^2}{16}(9+1+1) = \\frac{11a^2}{16}$.\n\nThus, there are exactly $4$ nearest neighbors, all at the same distance. The coordination number is $z=4$. Each substitutional site in the diamond lattice has tetrahedral point group symmetry ($T_d$). The four nearest-neighbor sites are transformed into one another by the symmetry operations of this group. Consequently, all nearest-neighbor exchange pathways are symmetry-equivalent. There is only one set of such equivalent sites.\n\n**2) Dopant Jump Distance ($r$)**\n\nThe dopant jump distance $r$ is the magnitude of the displacement vector connecting nearest-neighbor sites. From the calculation above, the squared distance is $r^2 = \\frac{3a^2}{16}$. Therefore, the jump distance is:\n$$r = \\sqrt{\\frac{3a^2}{16}} = \\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{4}$$\n\n**3) Geometric Factor ($G$)**\n\nThe diffusion coefficient $D$ for an isotropic, uncorrelated random walk in $3$ dimensions is given by the expression:\n$$D = \\frac{1}{6} \\Gamma_{tot} r_{jump}^2$$\nwhere $\\Gamma_{tot}$ is the total jump frequency out of a site and $r_{jump}$ is the distance of a single jump.\n\nIn this problem, the jump distance $r_{jump}$ is the nearest-neighbor distance $r$. The problem defines a per-neighbor jump frequency, which we will denote as $\\Gamma$. Since there are $z$ equivalent nearest-neighbor pathways, the total jump frequency is the sum of the frequencies for each pathway: $\\Gamma_{tot} = z \\Gamma$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $D$:\n$$D = \\frac{1}{6} (z\\Gamma) r^2 = \\Gamma \\left( \\frac{zr^2}{6} \\right)$$\nThe problem statement defines the geometric factor $G$ through the relation $D = \\Gamma G$. By comparing this with our derived expression, we identify $G$ as:\n$$G = \\frac{zr^2}{6}$$\nNow, we substitute the values for the coordination number $z$ and the jump distance $r$ that we determined from the geometry of the diamond cubic lattice: $z=4$ and $r^2 = \\frac{3a^2}{16}$.\n$$G = \\frac{4 \\left(\\frac{3a^2}{16}\\right)}{6}$$\n$$G = \\frac{\\frac{12a^2}{16}}{6} = \\frac{\\frac{3a^2}{4}}{6} = \\frac{3a^2}{24}$$\n$$G = \\frac{a^2}{8}$$\nThis expression for $G$ has dimensions of length squared and depends only on the lattice parameter $a$ and the dimensionless constants arising from the lattice geometry, as required.",
