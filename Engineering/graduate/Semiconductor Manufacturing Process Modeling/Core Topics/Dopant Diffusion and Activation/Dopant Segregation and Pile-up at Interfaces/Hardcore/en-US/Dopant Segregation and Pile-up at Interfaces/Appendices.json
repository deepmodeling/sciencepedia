The preferential accumulation of dopants at an interface is not a random process; it is driven by the system's tendency to minimize its Gibbs free energy. This fundamental principle governs the equilibrium partitioning of dopants between the bulk material and interfacial sites.\n\nThis first exercise grounds our understanding in these first principles. By calculating the segregation coefficient ($k$) from its constituent enthalpic ($\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{seg}}$) and entropic ($\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{seg}}$) components, you will develop a quantitative feel for how temperature mediates the balance between energetic favorability and configurational disorder in determining the final equilibrium state. You will also explore how the segregation behavior changes at high processing temperatures, a critical consideration in semiconductor manufacturing. ",

The system is in local thermodynamic equilibrium, which implies that the chemical potential of the dopant species is uniform across the interface and the adjacent bulk. Let $\\mu_{\\mathrm{int}}$ be the chemical potential of a dopant atom at an interfacial site and $\\mu_{\\mathrm{bulk}}$ be the chemical potential in a bulk site. At equilibrium, we must have:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{int}} = \\mu_{\\mathrm{bulk}}\n$$\nFor a dilute species, the chemical potential at a site of type $i$ (where $i$ is either 'int' for interface or 'bulk') can be expressed as:\n$$\n\\mu_i = g_i + k_B T \\ln\\left(\\frac{C_i}{N_i}\\right)\n$$\nHere, $g_i$ is the Gibbs free energy of a single dopant atom on a site of type $i$, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $C_i$ is the concentration of dopant atoms, and $N_i$ is the concentration of available sites.

The term $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{seg}}^{\\sigma} = \\Omega \\sigma_h$ arises from the mechanical work associated with placing a dopant atom into a stressed lattice. The partial molar volume $\\Omega$ represents the volume change of the system when one dopant atom is introduced. When this volume change occurs in a region under a hydrostatic stress $\\sigma_h$, mechanical work of amount $P\\Delta V$ is done on the system. For a single atom, this work is $\\sigma_h \\Omega$. This work term modifies the defect's formation enthalpy. If the bulk is unstressed (the reference state), the segregation enthalpy, $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{seg}} = H_{\\mathrm{int}} - H_{\\mathrm{bulk}}$, is increased by $\\Omega \\sigma_h$. A positive (compressive) stress $\\sigma_h$ increases the energy cost of accommodating an oversized dopant ($\\Omega > 0$), thus making segregation to the stressed interface less favorable.\n\nFinally, we determine the multiplicative change in the segregation coefficient, $k/k_0$.

In this frame, the diffusion equation (Fick's second law) is modified by a convective term due to the material flowing towards the interface at speed $v$. For a steady state, the concentration profile $C(x')$ is time-independent, satisfying the convection-diffusion equation:\n$$\nD \\frac{d^2 C}{d(x')^2} + v \\frac{dC}{dx'} = 0\n$$\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous ODE.
