            "problem": "A high-aspect-ratio trench etch uses cyclic sidewall passivation to control anisotropy. In each cycle, an inhibitor is deposited on the sidewall for a duration $t_{d}$, followed by an ion-assisted etch for a duration $t_{e}$.

During the deposition step, the thickness increases at a constant sidewall-effective rate $R_{d,\\mathrm{sw}}$, where the sidewall-effective rate is reduced relative to normal-incidence deposition by a geometric sticking/shadowing factor $s \\in (0,1)$ so that $R_{d,\\mathrm{sw}} = s R_{d}$.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, complete, and consistent. It describes a physically plausible, albeit simplified, model of a cyclic deposition-etch process common in semiconductor manufacturing. The parameters provided are reasonable, and the tasks requested are standard analyses for such a dynamical system. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nLet $t_k$ be the thickness of the inhibitor film on the sidewall at the beginning of the $k$-th cycle. A full cycle consists of a deposition step of duration $t_d$ followed by an etch step of duration $t_e$.\n\nFirst, we model the deposition step. The thickness increases at a constant rate $R_{d,\\mathrm{sw}} = s R_{d}$. If the thickness at the start of the deposition is $t_k$, the total thickness added during this step is the rate multiplied by the duration, $s R_{d} t_{d}$. Let $t'_{k}$ be the thickness at the end of the deposition step (and thus at the beginning of the etch step).\n$$\nt'_{k} = t_k + s R_{d} t_{d}\n$$\n\nNext, we model the etch step. This process is governed by first-order kinetics, where the rate of change of thickness is proportional to the current thickness. The governing differential equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}t}{\\mathrm{d}\\tau} = -R_{e} t\n$$\nwhere $\\tau$ is the time elapsed within the etch step, from $\\tau=0$ to $\\tau=t_e$. The initial condition for this step is the thickness at its start, which is $t'_{k}$. We solve this ordinary differential equation by separation of variables:\n$$\n\\int_{t'_{k}}^{t_{k+1}} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}t}{t} = \\int_{0}^{t_e} -R_{e} \\, \\mathrm{d}\\tau\n$$\nwhere $t_{k+1}$ is the final thickness at the end of the etch step, which is also the thickness at the beginning of the next cycle. Integrating both sides yields:\n$$\n[\\ln|t|]_{t'_{k}}^{t_{k+1}} = [-R_{e} \\tau]_{0}^{t_e}\n$$\nSince thickness $t$ must be non-negative, we have:\n$$\n\\ln(t_{k+1}) - \\ln(t'_{k}) = -R_{e} t_e\n$$\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{t_{k+1}}{t'_{k}}\\right) = -R_{e} t_e\n$$\nSolving for $t_{k+1}$:\n$$\nt_{k+1} = t'_{k} \\exp(-R_{e} t_e)\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $t'_{k}$ from the deposition step to obtain a recurrence relation for the thickness from one cycle to the next:\n$$\nt_{k+1} = (t_k + s R_{d} t_{d}) \\exp(-R_{e} t_e)\n$$\nThis equation describes the evolution of the sidewall thickness over discrete cycles.\n\nThe first required derivation is the net per-cycle change in sidewall thickness, $\\Delta t_k = t_{k+1} - t_k$. Using the recurrence relation derived above:\n$$\n\\Delta t_k = (t_k + s R_{d} t_{d}) \\exp(-R_{e} t_e) - t_k\n$$\nThis expression gives the net change in thickness during cycle $k$ as a function of the thickness $t_k$ at the beginning of that cycle.\n\nThe second required derivation is the steady-state sidewall thickness, $t^*$. At steady state, the thickness no longer changes from one cycle to the next. This condition is mathematically expressed as $t_{k+1} = t_k = t^*$. This also implies that the net per-cycle change is zero, $\\Delta t_k = 0$. Substituting $t^*$ into the recurrence relation:\n$$\nt^* = (t^* + s R_{d} t_{d}) \\exp(-R_{e} t_e)\n$$\nWe now solve this equation for $t^*$:\n$$\nt^* = t^* \\exp(-R_{e} t_e) + s R_{d} t_{d} \\exp(-R_{e} t_e)\n$$\n$$\nt^* - t^* \\exp(-R_{e} t_e) = s R_{d} t_{d} \\exp(-R_{e} t_e)\n$$\n$$\nt^* (1 - \\exp(-R_{e} t_e)) = s R_{d} t_{d} \\exp(-R_{e} t_e)\n$$\n$$\nt^* = \\frac{s R_{d} t_{d} \\exp(-R_{e} t_e)}{1 - \\exp(-R_{e} t_e)}\n$$\nTo obtain a more convenient form, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $\\exp(R_{e} t_e)$:\n$$\nt^* = \\frac{s R_{d} t_{d} \\exp(-R_{e} t_e) \\exp(R_{e} t_e)}{(1 - \\exp(-R_{e} t_e)) \\exp(R_{e} t_e)} = \\frac{s R_{d} t_{d}}{\\exp(R_{e} t_e) - 1}\n$$\nThis is the analytical expression for the steady-state sidewall thickness.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of $t^*$ using the provided process parameters:\n$R_{d} = 3.5$ nm/s\n$s = 0.25$\n$t_{d} = 0.8$ s\n$R_{e} = 2.0$ s$^{-1}$\n$t_{e} = 0.3$ s\n\nFirst, we calculate the arguments of the expression for $t^*$:\nThe amount of material deposited per cycle on the sidewall is:\n$$\ns R_{d} t_{d} = (0.25) \\times (3.5 \\, \\text{nm/s}) \\times (0.8 \\, \\text{s}) = 0.7 \\, \\text{nm}\n$$\nThe dimensionless argument of the exponential function is:\n$$\nR_{e} t_{e} = (2.0 \\, \\text{s}^{-1}) \\times (0.3 \\, \\text{s}) = 0.6\n$$\nNow, substitute these values into the expression for $t^*$:\n$$\nt^* = \\frac{0.7}{\\exp(0.6) - 1} \\, \\text{nm}\n$$\nUsing the value $\\exp(0.6) \\approx 1.8221188$:\n$$\nt^* \\approx \\frac{0.7}{1.8221188 - 1} \\, \\text{nm} = \\frac{0.7}{0.8221188} \\, \\text{nm} \\approx 0.851463 \\, \\text{nm}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nt^* \\approx 0.8515 \\, \\text{nm}\n$$",

This allows us to examine the spatial balance between diffusion and reaction.

The units of $D_s$ are $[\\text{length}]^2/[\\text{time}]$ and the units of $k_{\\text{eff}}$ are $1/[\\text{time}]$, so the units of $\\frac{k_{\\text{eff}}}{D_{s}}$ are indeed $(\\frac{1}{[\\text{time}]}) / (\\frac{[\\text{length}]^2}{[\\text{time}]}) = \\frac{1}{[\\text{length}]^2}$.\n\nWe define the characteristic length scale, $L_s$, such that:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{L_s^2} = \\frac{k_{\\text{eff}}}{D_{s}}\n$$\nSolving for $L_s$ gives:\n$$\nL_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{D_{s}}{k_{\\text{eff}}}}\n$$\nThis length scale, $L_s$, represents the average distance a species can diffuse along the surface before being consumed by the reaction.\n\nNext, we establish the condition under which surface diffusion can homogenize the coverage along the entire sidewall of depth $H$. Homogenization implies that the coverage $\\theta(y)$ is nearly uniform over the domain $y \\in [0, H]$. This occurs when the transport mechanism (diffusion) is much faster or more effective over the length of the trench than the consumption mechanism (reaction). In other words, a diffusing particle must be able to travel a distance much greater than the trench depth $H$ before it reacts. This physical reasoning leads to the condition that the characteristic diffusion length must be much larger than the physical dimension of the system:\n$$\nL_s \\gg H\n$$\nExpressed as a dimensionless ratio, this condition is:\n$$\n\\frac{L_s}{H} \\gg 1\n$$\nWhen this condition is met, diffusion dominates, and the coverage profile tends to be flat.
