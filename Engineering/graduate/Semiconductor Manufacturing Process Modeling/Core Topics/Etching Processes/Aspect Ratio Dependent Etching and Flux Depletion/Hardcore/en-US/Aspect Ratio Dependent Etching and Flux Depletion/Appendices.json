            "solution": "The problem requires a two-part solution: first, to derive an expression for the surface reaction rate coefficient $k_s$, and second, to compute its numerical value for given parameters.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Surface Reaction Rate Coefficient $k_s$**\n\nThe problem asks for a boundary condition for the reactive loss flux $J_w$ of the form $J_w = k_s c$, where $c$ is the number concentration of reactive species. The reaction is a first-order surface process with a sticking probability $\\alpha$.\n\nThe reactive loss flux $J_w$ is the rate at which molecules are consumed by the surface reaction per unit area. This is equal to the incident flux of molecules on the surface, $\\Gamma$, multiplied by the probability that an impinging molecule will react, which is the sticking probability $\\alpha$.\n$$J_w = \\alpha \\Gamma$$\nThe next step is to find an expression for the incident molecular flux $\\Gamma$. According to the kinetic theory of gases, for an ideal gas with an isotropic Maxwellian velocity distribution at temperature $T$, the flux of molecules impinging on a planar surface is given by the Hertz-Knudsen equation. We will derive this result.\n\nLet the surface lie in the $xy$-plane. The flux of particles is the number of particles crossing a unit area per unit time. The number of particles with velocities in the range $d^3\\vec{v}$ around $\\vec{v}$ is $c f(\\vec{v}) d^3\\vec{v}$, where $f(\\vec{v})$ is the normalized Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution function. The contribution to the flux from these particles is $v_z c f(\\vec{v}) d^3\\vec{v}$, where $v_z$ is the velocity component normal to the surface. To find the total flux $\\Gamma$ of particles hitting the surface, we integrate over all possible velocities for which the particles are moving towards the surface (i.e., $v_z > 0$).\n$$\\Gamma = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dv_x \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dv_y \\int_{0}^{\\infty} dv_z \\, v_z \\, c f(v_x, v_y, v_z)$$\nThe Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution is given by:\n$$f(v_x, v_y, v_z) = \\left(\\frac{m}{2\\pi k_B T}\\right)^{3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m(v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2)}{2k_B T}\\right)$$\nSubstituting this into the integral for $\\Gamma$:\n$$\\Gamma = c \\left(\\frac{m}{2\\pi k_B T}\\right)^{3/2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv_x^2}{2k_B T}\\right) dv_x \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv_y^2}{2k_B T}\\right) dv_y \\int_{0}^{\\infty} v_z \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv_z^2}{2k_B T}\\right) dv_z$$\nThe first two integrals are standard Gaussian integrals of the form $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-ax^2)dx = \\sqrt{\\pi/a}$. With $a = \\frac{m}{2k_B T}$, each of these integrals evaluates to $\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi k_B T}{m}}$.\nThe third integral can be solved using substitution. Let $u = \\frac{mv_z^2}{2k_B T}$, so $du = \\frac{mv_z}{k_B T} dv_z$. The integral becomes:\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\infty} v_z \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv_z^2}{2k_B T}\\right) dv_z = \\frac{k_B T}{m} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-u) du = \\frac{k_B T}{m} [- \\exp(-u)]_0^\\infty = \\frac{k_B T}{m}$$\nCombining these results:\n$$\\Gamma = c \\left(\\frac{m}{2\\pi k_B T}\\right)^{3/2} \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi k_B T}{m}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{k_B T}{m}\\right) = c \\left(\\frac{m}{2\\pi k_B T}\\right)^{3/2} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi k_B T}{m}\\right) \\left(\\frac{k_B T}{m}\\right)$$\n$$\\Gamma = c \\left(\\frac{m}{2\\pi k_B T}\\right)^{1/2} \\left(\\frac{k_B T}{m}\\right) = c \\sqrt{\\frac{k_B T}{2\\pi m}}$$\nThe problem asks to express the result in terms of the mean thermal speed $\\bar{v}$. The mean speed of molecules in a Maxwellian gas is:\n$$\\bar{v} = \\sqrt{\\frac{8 k_B T}{\\pi m}}$$\nWe can relate our expression for $\\Gamma$ to $\\bar{v}$:\n$$\\Gamma = c \\sqrt{\\frac{k_B T}{2\\pi m}} = c \\frac{1}{4} \\sqrt{\\frac{16 k_B T}{2\\pi m}} = c \\frac{1}{4} \\sqrt{\\frac{8 k_B T}{\\pi m}} = \\frac{1}{4} c \\bar{v}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $\\Gamma$ back into the equation for the reactive loss flux $J_w$:\n$$J_w = \\alpha \\Gamma = \\alpha \\left(\\frac{1}{4} c \\bar{v}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{\\alpha \\bar{v}}{4}\\right) c$$\nBy comparing this to the desired form $J_w = k_s c$, we can identify the surface reaction rate coefficient $k_s$:\n$$k_s = \\frac{\\alpha \\bar{v}}{4}$$\n\n**Part 2: Numerical Computation of $k_s$**\n\nWe are given the following parameters:\n- Species: Fluorine atoms\n- Mass: $m = 19\\,\\mathrm{u}$\n- Temperature: $T = 600\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- Sticking probability: $\\alpha = 0.15$\n- Boltzmann constant: $k_B = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}$\n- Atomic mass unit: $1\\,\\mathrm{u} = 1.66053906660 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n\nFirst, we must express the mass of a fluorine atom in SI units (kilograms):\n$$m = 19\\,\\mathrm{u} \\times \\frac{1.66053906660 \\times 10^{-27}\\,\\mathrm{kg}}{1\\,\\mathrm{u}} = 3.15502422654 \\times 10^{-26}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$$\nNext, we compute the mean thermal speed $\\bar{v}$:\n$$\\bar{v} = \\sqrt{\\frac{8 k_B T}{\\pi m}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{8 \\times (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (600\\,\\mathrm{K})}{\\pi \\times (3.15502422654 \\times 10^{-26}\\,\\mathrm{kg})}}$$\n$$\\bar{v} = \\sqrt{\\frac{6.6271152 \\times 10^{-20}\\,\\mathrm{J}}{9.9118500 \\times 10^{-26}\\,\\mathrm{kg}}} = \\sqrt{668610.15\\,\\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-2}}} \\approx 817.6858\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$$\nNow, we can compute $k_s$ using the derived expression:\n$$k_s = \\frac{\\alpha \\bar{v}}{4} = \\frac{0.15 \\times 817.6858\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}}{4} \\approx 30.6632\\,\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$$\nThe problem requires the final answer in units of $\\mathrm{cm\\,s^{-1}}$.

            "problem": "A high-aspect-ratio trench encountered in Aspect Ratio Dependent Etching (ARDE) is modeled as a straight channel of constant cross-section with area $A$ and wetted perimeter $P$ along the axial coordinate $z \\geq 0$. A dilute reactive species with cross-section-averaged concentration $C(z)$ is transported along $z$ by Knudsen diffusion with Knudsen diffusivity $D_{K}$ and consumed on the sidewalls by a first-order surface reaction with rate constant $k_{s}$, so that the local wall consumption flux per unit wall area is $j_{s}(z) = k_{s} C(z)$. Assume isothermal, isobaric, steady-state conditions, negligible axial convection, and negligible axial accumulation. The axial molar flux of the species is $J(z)$ (defined positive in the $+z$ direction).\n\nUsing only conservation of mass over a differential control volume and Fick’s law for diffusion, derive a one-dimensional governing equation for $C(z)$ and from it show that the axial flux exhibits exponential depletion with depth of the form $J(z) \\sim J_{0} \\exp(-z / \\ell_{d})$ for sufficiently long trenches, where $J_{0}$ is the entrance flux at $z = 0$. Define the depletion length scale $\\ell_{d}$ in terms of $D_{K}$, $k_{s}$, $A$, and $P$, and provide a closed-form expression for $\\ell_{d}$.\n\nYour final answer must be a single closed-form analytic expression for $\\ell_{d}$. No numerical evaluation is required and no rounding is needed.",
            "solution": "The derivation proceeds in three main steps: first, a mole balance is performed on a differential control volume of the trench to relate the change in molar flux to the rate of consumption at the walls. Second, Fick's law of diffusion is used to express the molar flux in terms of the concentration gradient. Finally, these two relations are combined to form a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the concentration $C(z)$, which is then solved to find the expression for the axial flux $J(z)$ and the depletion length $\\ell_{d}$.\n\nStep 1: Conservation of Mass (Mole Balance)\nWe consider a differential control volume of the trench, represented as a slice of length $\\Delta z$ located at a distance $z$ from the entrance. The volume of this slice is $V = A \\Delta z$, and the area of the reactive sidewalls is $A_{wall} = P \\Delta z$. At steady state, the rate of accumulation is zero. The molar balance is given by:\n$$\n(\\text{Molar flow rate in}) - (\\text{Molar flow rate out}) - (\\text{Rate of consumption}) = 0\n$$\nThe molar flow rate at a position $z$ is the product of the molar flux $J(z)$ and the cross-sectional area $A$. The balance equation can be written as:\n$$\nJ(z) A - J(z + \\Delta z) A - j_{s}(z) (P \\Delta z) = 0\n$$\nThe problem states that the local wall consumption flux is $j_{s}(z) = k_{s} C(z)$. Substituting this into the balance equation gives:\n$$\nJ(z) A - J(z + \\Delta z) A - k_{s} C(z) P \\Delta z = 0\n$$\nDividing the entire equation by the volume of the element, $A \\Delta z$, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{J(z) - J(z + \\Delta z)}{\\Delta z} - \\frac{k_{s} P}{A} C(z) = 0\n$$\nTaking the limit as $\\Delta z \\to 0$, the first term becomes the negative of the derivative of $J(z)$ with respect to $z$:\n$$\n-\\frac{dJ}{dz} - \\frac{k_{s} P}{A} C(z) = 0\n$$\nThis equation relates the spatial change in the axial flux to the concentration of the reactive species.\n\nStep 2: Fick's Law of Diffusion\nThe problem states that transport along the z-axis is by Knudsen diffusion. According to Fick's first law, the molar flux $J(z)$ is proportional to the negative of the concentration gradient. The constant of proportionality is the Knudsen diffusivity, $D_{K}$.\n$$\nJ(z) = -D_{K} \\frac{dC}{dz}\n$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the net movement of the species is from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration.\n\nStep 3: Derivation and Solution of the Governing Equation\nWe now have a system of two equations. To obtain a single governing equation for $C(z)$, we differentiate the Fick's law expression with respect to $z$:\n$$\n\\frac{dJ}{dz} = \\frac{d}{dz} \\left(-D_{K} \\frac{dC}{dz}\\right) = -D_{K} \\frac{d^2 C}{dz^2}\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $\\frac{dJ}{dz}$ into the mole balance equation derived in Step 1:\n$$\n-\\left(-D_{K} \\frac{d^2 C}{dz^2}\\right) - \\frac{k_{s} P}{A} C(z) = 0\n$$\n$$\nD_{K} \\frac{d^2 C}{dz^2} - \\frac{k_{s} P}{A} C(z) = 0\n$$\nRearranging this gives the final governing ODE for the concentration profile $C(z)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 C}{dz^2} - \\left(\\frac{k_{s} P}{A D_{K}}\\right) C(z) = 0\n$$\nThis is a second-order, linear, homogeneous ordinary differential equation. Let us define a characteristic inverse length $\\lambda$ as:\n$$\n\\lambda^2 = \\frac{k_{s} P}{A D_{K}}\n$$\nThe ODE then simplifies to:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2 C}{dz^2} - \\lambda^2 C(z) = 0\n$$\nThe general solution to this equation is:\n$$\nC(z) = c_{1} \\exp(\\lambda z) + c_{2} \\exp(-\\lambda z)\n$$\nwhere $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ are constants determined by boundary conditions. For a \"sufficiently long trench\" ($z \\ge 0$), the physical conditions require that the concentration of the reactive species does not grow infinitely large as $z \\to \\infty$. Instead, it should decay to zero as it is consumed. This implies the boundary condition $\\lim_{z \\to \\infty} C(z) = 0$. For this to hold, the coefficient of the growing exponential term, $c_{1}$, must be zero.\nTherefore, the solution simplifies to:\n$$\nC(z) = c_{2} \\exp(-\\lambda z)\n$$\nAt the trench entrance, $z=0$, let the concentration be $C(0) = C_{0}$. This gives $C_{0} = c_{2} \\exp(0) = c_{2}$. So, the concentration profile is:\n$$\nC(z) = C_{0} \\exp(-\\lambda z)\n$$\nNow, we can find the axial flux profile $J(z)$ by substituting this concentration profile back into Fick's law:\n$$\nJ(z) = -D_{K} \\frac{dC}{dz} = -D_{K} \\frac{d}{dz} \\left[ C_{0} \\exp(-\\lambda z) \\right]\n$$\n$$\nJ(z) = -D_{K} [C_{0} (-\\lambda) \\exp(-\\lambda z)] = D_{K} C_{0} \\lambda \\exp(-\\lambda z)\n$$\nThe flux at the entrance of the trench, $z=0$, is $J_{0}$:\n$$\nJ_{0} = J(0) = D_{K} C_{0} \\lambda \\exp(0) = D_{K} C_{0} \\lambda\n$$\nBy substituting $J_{0}$ into the expression for $J(z)$, we get:\n$$\nJ(z) = J_{0} \\exp(-\\lambda z)\n$$\nThis result demonstrates the exponential depletion of the axial flux with depth, as stated in the problem. The form is $J(z) \\sim J_{0} \\exp(-z / \\ell_{d})$. By comparing the exponents, we can identify the depletion length scale $\\ell_{d}$:\n$$\n-\\lambda z = -\\frac{z}{\\ell_{d}} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\ell_{d} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\n$$\nRecalling the definition of $\\lambda$, we can write the closed-form expression for $\\ell_{d}$:\n$$\n\\ell_{d} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{k_{s} P}{A D_{K}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{A D_{K}}{k_{s} P}}\n$$\nThis expression defines the characteristic length over which the reactant flux decays significantly due to consumption at the sidewalls.",
