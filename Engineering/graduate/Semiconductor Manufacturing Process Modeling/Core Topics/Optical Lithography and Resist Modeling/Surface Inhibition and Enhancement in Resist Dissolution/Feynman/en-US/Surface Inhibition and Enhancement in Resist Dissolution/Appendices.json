This practice guides you through the derivation of the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, a cornerstone model describing the equilibrium between inhibitor molecules in the developer and those adsorbed onto the resist.

            "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the equilibrium fractional surface coverage, $\\theta$, and the inhibited dissolution rate, $R$, for a photoresist surface exposed to an inhibitor in a developer solution. This physical situation is modeled using the principles of mass-action kinetics for a reversible surface adsorption process, which is assumed to be in quasi-equilibrium.\n\nFirst, we formalize the adsorption-desorption process. Let $I$ be an inhibitor molecule in the developer solution, $S$ be a vacant adsorption site on the resist surface, and $IS$ be an occupied site. The reversible reaction is:\n$$\nI + S \\rightleftharpoons IS\n$$\nThe rate of the forward reaction (adsorption), $r_{\\mathrm{ads}}$, is proportional to the bulk concentration of the inhibitor, $C$, and the concentration of vacant sites on the surface, which we can denote as $[S]$. Using mass-action kinetics, we have:\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{ads}} = k_{a} C [S]\n$$\nwhere $k_a$ is the adsorption rate constant.\n\nThe rate of the reverse reaction (desorption), $r_{\\mathrm{des}}$, is proportional to the concentration of occupied sites on the surface, $[IS]$:\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{des}} = k_{d} [IS]\n$$\nwhere $k_d$ is the desorption rate constant.\n\nThe problem states that the adsorption-desorption process is fast and reaches a quasi-equilibrium state. At equilibrium, the rate of adsorption equals the rate of desorption:\n$$\nr_{\\mathrm{ads}} = r_{\\mathrm{des}}\n$$\n$$\nk_{a} C [S] = k_{d} [IS]\n$$\nThe equilibrium constant for the adsorption reaction, $K$, is defined as the ratio of the forward to the reverse rate constants, $K = \\frac{k_{a}}{k_{d}}$. Substituting this into the equilibrium condition gives:\n$$\nK C [S] = [IS]\n$$\nThis equation relates the concentrations of occupied and vacant sites at equilibrium. To solve for the fractional coverage, we introduce the concept of site conservation. Let $S_{\\mathrm{total}}$ be the total concentration of surface sites (a constant). The total number of sites is the sum of vacant and occupied sites:\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{total}} = [S] + [IS]\n$$\nThe fractional coverage, $\\theta$, is defined as the fraction of sites that are occupied by the inhibitor:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{[IS]}{S_{\\mathrm{total}}}\n$$\nFrom this, it follows that $[IS] = \\theta S_{\\mathrm{total}}$. The fraction of vacant sites is $(1 - \\theta)$:\n$$\n1 - \\theta = \\frac{[S]}{S_{\\mathrm{total}}}\n$$\nThis gives $[S] = (1 - \\theta) S_{\\mathrm{total}}$.\n\nNow we substitute these expressions for $[S]$ and $[IS]$ into the equilibrium equation, $K C [S] = [IS]$:\n$$\nK C (1 - \\theta) S_{\\mathrm{total}} = \\theta S_{\\mathrm{total}}\n$$\nSince $S_{\\mathrm{total}}$ is non-zero, it can be cancelled from both sides:\n$$\nK C (1 - \\theta) = \\theta\n$$\nWe now solve this equation for $\\theta$:\n$$\nK C - K C \\theta = \\theta\n$$\n$$\nK C = \\theta + K C \\theta\n$$\n$$\nK C = \\theta (1 + K C)\n$$\nThis yields the expression for the equilibrium fractional coverage $\\theta$ in terms of $K$ and $C$, which is the Langmuir adsorption isotherm:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{K C}{1 + K C}\n$$\nNext, we derive the expression for the inhibited dissolution rate, $R$. The problem states that the intrinsic dissolution rate for a completely clean surface ($\\theta=0$) is $R_{0}$, and the observed rate $R$ is proportional to the fraction of vacant sites, $(1-\\theta)$. We can write this relationship as:\n$$\nR = \\alpha (1 - \\theta)\n$$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is a proportionality constant. We can determine $\\alpha$ by considering the case of a clean surface where $C=0$. In this case, $\\theta = \\frac{K \\cdot 0}{1 + K \\cdot 0} = 0$, and the rate is the intrinsic rate, $R = R_{0}$. Substituting these into the rate equation:\n$$\nR_{0} = \\alpha (1 - 0) \\implies \\alpha = R_{0}\n$$\nThus, the expression for the dissolution rate is:\n$$\nR = R_{0} (1 - \\theta)\n$$\nTo express $R$ in terms of $R_{0}$, $K$, and $C$, we first find an expression for $(1 - \\theta)$:\n$$\n1 - \\theta = 1 - \\frac{K C}{1 + K C} = \\frac{(1 + K C) - K C}{1 + K C} = \\frac{1}{1 + K C}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the equation for $R$, we obtain the final expression for the inhibited dissolution rate:\n$$\nR = \\frac{R_{0}}{1 + K C}\n$$\nFinally, we evaluate $\\theta$ and $R$ using the given numerical values: $K = 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{L/mol}$, $C = 5 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{mol/L}$, and $R_{0} = 100\\,\\mathrm{nm/min}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the dimensionless product $KC$:\n$$\nKC = (10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{L/mol}) \\times (5 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{mol/L}) = 5 \\times 10^{-3} = 0.005\n$$\nNow, we calculate the fractional coverage $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{KC}{1 + KC} = \\frac{0.005}{1 + 0.005} = \\frac{0.005}{1.005} \\approx 0.004975124...\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\theta = 0.004975$.\n\nNext, we calculate the dissolution rate $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{R_{0}}{1 + KC} = \\frac{100\\,\\mathrm{nm/min}}{1 + 0.005} = \\frac{100}{1.005}\\,\\mathrm{nm/min} \\approx 99.502487... \\,\\mathrm{nm/min}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $R = 99.50\\,\\mathrm{nm/min}$.\n\nThe evaluated quantities are the fractional coverage $\\theta = 0.004975$ and the dissolution rate $R = 99.50\\,\\mathrm{nm/min}$.",

            "introduction": "Our initial models often assume the developer concentration at the resist surface is identical to the bulk concentration, but this is not always true. This exercise challenges that assumption by introducing the concept of a stagnant boundary layer, where diffusion of the developer to the reactive surface can become the rate-limiting step.

            "problem": "In an immersion development step for a positive-tone photoresist, the aqueous developer diffuses through a stationary boundary layer of thickness $L$ adjacent to a flat resist surface at $x=0$. The developer has molecular diffusion coefficient $D$ in the aqueous phase. The far-field bulk developer concentration at $x=L$ is $c_b$. At the resist interface, surface chemistry associated with inhibited and enhanced dissolution sites can be represented, at the scale of the continuum developer field, by an effective first-order surface reaction that consumes developer with a rate per unit area $r_s = k\\,c_s$, where $k$ is a surface rate constant and $c_s$ is the interfacial developer concentration $c(x=0)$.

No rounding is required and no numerical value for $c_b$ is provided.",
            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It is a standard problem in chemical reaction engineering and mass transfer, describing diffusion and reaction in a one-dimensional, steady-state system. All necessary data and conditions are provided for a unique solution.\n\nThe problem asks for a derivation of the interfacial developer concentration, $c_s$, starting from first principles. The system consists of a stationary aqueous boundary layer of thickness $L$ over a reactive photoresist surface located at $x=0$. The domain of interest is therefore $0 \\le x \\le L$.\n\nFirst, we apply the principle of steady-state species conservation for the developer. In a one-dimensional system with no homogeneous reactions, the species continuity equation is:\n$$ \\frac{d J_x}{d x} = 0 $$\nwhere $J_x$ is the molar flux of the developer in the $x$-direction. This equation implies that the flux $J_x$ is constant for all $x$ in the domain $0 \\le x \\le L$.\n\nNext, we invoke Fick's first law of diffusion, which relates the flux to the concentration gradient:\n$$ J_x = -D \\frac{dc}{dx} $$\nwhere $D$ is the constant molecular diffusion coefficient and $c(x)$ is the developer concentration.\n\nCombining these two principles, we have:\n$$ -D \\frac{dc}{dx} = \\text{constant} $$\nSince $D$ is a constant, the concentration gradient $\\frac{dc}{dx}$ must also be a constant. This implies that the second derivative of the concentration with respect to position is zero:\n$$ \\frac{d^2c}{dx^2} = 0 $$\nThe general solution to this second-order ordinary differential equation is a linear concentration profile:\n$$ c(x) = C_1 x + C_2 $$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants of integration to be determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nWe have two boundary conditions. The first is at the edge of the boundary layer, $x=L$:\nBC 1: $c(L) = c_b$\nApplying this to the general solution gives:\n$$ c_b = C_1 L + C_2 \\quad (1) $$\n\nThe second boundary condition is at the reactive resist surface, $x=0$. Here, the rate of developer arrival by diffusion must equal the rate of developer consumption by the surface reaction. The rate of arrival (molar flow per unit area) towards the surface is the magnitude of the diffusive flux at $x=0$. The flux vector points in the direction of decreasing concentration, which is the $-x$ direction. The flux in the $+x$ direction is $J_x(0) = -D \\frac{dc}{dx}\\rvert_{x=0}$. The rate of arrival at the surface is thus $-J_x(0) = D \\frac{dc}{dx}\\rvert_{x=0}$. The rate of consumption per unit area is given as a first-order reaction, $r_s = k\\,c_s$, where $c_s = c(0)$.\nEquating these rates gives the second boundary condition:\nBC 2: $D \\frac{dc}{dx}\\rvert_{x=0} = k c(0)$\n\nFrom the general solution $c(x) = C_1 x + C_2$, we find $c(0) = C_2$ and $\\frac{dc}{dx} = C_1$. Substituting these into BC 2 yields:\n$$ D C_1 = k C_2 \\implies C_1 = \\frac{k}{D} C_2 \\quad (2) $$\n\nNow we have a system of two linear equations for $C_1$ and $C_2$. Substituting equation (2) into equation (1):\n$$ c_b = \\left(\\frac{k}{D} C_2\\right) L + C_2 $$\nFactoring out $C_2$:\n$$ c_b = C_2 \\left( \\frac{k L}{D} + 1 \\right) $$\nWe are looking for the interfacial concentration $c_s = c(0) = C_2$. Solving for $C_2$:\n$$ c_s = \\frac{c_b}{1 + \\frac{kL}{D}} $$\nThe problem defines the Damköhler number as $\\mathrm{Da} = \\frac{kL}{D}$. Substituting this definition into the expression for $c_s$ gives the desired relationship:\n$$ c_s = \\frac{c_b}{1 + \\mathrm{Da}} $$\nThis completes the first part of the derivation.\n\nFor the second part, we are given $\\mathrm{Da} = 10$. Substituting this value into the derived expression:\n$$ c_s = \\frac{c_b}{1 + 10} = \\frac{c_b}{11} $$\nThe interfacial concentration is $1/11$ of the bulk concentration.\n\nFor the final part, we must determine if the process is reaction-limited or transport-limited. The Damköhler number, $\\mathrm{Da} = \\frac{kL}{D}$, represents the ratio of a characteristic reaction rate to a characteristic mass transport (diffusion) rate.\nA more formal way to see this is to consider the maximum possible reaction rate, which would occur if $c_s = c_b$, giving a rate of $k c_b$. The maximum transport rate occurs when $c_s=0$, giving a concentration gradient of approximately $c_b/L$ and a flux of $D c_b/L$. The ratio of these maximum rates is $\\frac{k c_b}{D c_b/L} = \\frac{kL}{D} = \\mathrm{Da}$.\n\n- If $\\mathrm{Da} \\ll 1$, the reaction is much slower than diffusion. Reactant is supplied to the surface much faster than it is consumed. The surface concentration $c_s$ approaches the bulk concentration $c_b$. The overall process rate is limited by the slow surface chemistry, and the system is termed **reaction-limited**.\n\n- If $\\mathrm{Da} \\gg 1$, the reaction is much faster than diffusion. Reactant is consumed almost as soon as it arrives at the surface. This depletes the surface concentration, so $c_s \\ll c_b$. The overall process rate is limited by the slow rate of diffusion of reactant to the surface, and the system is termed **transport-limited** (or diffusion-limited).\n\nIn this problem, $\\mathrm{Da} = 10$. Since $10 \\gg 1$, the characteristic rate of reaction is an order of magnitude larger than the characteristic rate of diffusion. The process is therefore **transport-limited**. This conclusion is quantitatively supported by our calculation that $c_s = c_b/11$, which shows a significant depletion of the developer concentration at the interface (a drop to less than $10\\%$ of the bulk value), a hallmark of a transport-limited system. The rate-limiting step is the diffusion of developer across the boundary layer, not its consumption at the surface.\n\nThe final answer requested is the simplified algebraic expression for $c_s$ in terms of $c_b$ for the case $\\mathrm{Da}=10$.\n$$ c_s = \\frac{c_b}{11} $$",
