            "problem": "A chemically amplified photoresist film is modeled as a two-phase medium consisting of an immobile polymer matrix of volume fraction $\\phi_p \\in (0,1)$ and a contiguous nonpolymer free volume fraction $1-\\phi_p$ that hosts all mobile small molecules. The resist formulation contains a Photoacid Generator (PAG) with laboratory molarity $C_{\\mathrm{PAG}}$ and a basic quencher with laboratory molarity $C_B$, where both molarities are defined per unit total film volume prior to exposure. After exposure, each PAG molecule photolyzes with unit quantum yield to release exactly one proton (acid), and the Post-Exposure Bake (PEB) begins immediately. Assume that acid–base neutralization in the nonpolymer phase is instantaneous and stoichiometric with $1{:}1$ equivalence (one proton neutralizes one base molecule to form an inert salt), that no other reactions occur before the start of PEB, and that deprotection of protected polymer sites has not yet proceeded at $t=0^{+}$ of PEB.

            "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure it is self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- Photoresist film is a two-phase medium.\n- Volume fraction of immobile polymer matrix: $\\phi_p \\in (0,1)$.\n- Volume fraction of nonpolymer free volume: $1-\\phi_p$.\n- Mobile small molecules are hosted in the nonpolymer free volume.\n- Laboratory molarity of Photoacid Generator (PAG): $C_{\\mathrm{PAG}}$ (moles per unit total film volume).\n- Laboratory molarity of basic quencher: $C_B$ (moles per unit total film volume).\n- PAG photolysis: one PAG molecule yields one proton ($H^{+}$) with unit quantum yield.\n- Post-Exposure Bake (PEB) starts at time $t=0$.\n- At $t=0$ (specifically, $t=0^{+}$):\n    - Acid-base neutralization is instantaneous and stoichiometric with $1{:}1$ equivalence.\n    - Neutralization occurs in the nonpolymer phase.\n    - No other reactions have occurred.\n    - Deprotection has not yet started.\n- State variables, defined per unit nonpolymer free volume:\n    - Hydrogen ion concentration: $[H^{+}]$.\n    - Free base concentration: $[B]$.\n    - Deprotected fraction of polymer sites: $f$.\n- Objective: Derive expressions for the initial conditions $[H^{+}]_0 = [H^{+}](\\mathbf{r},0)$, $[B]_0 = [B](\\mathbf{r},0)$, and $f_0 = f(\\mathbf{r},0)$ in terms of $\\phi_p$, $C_{\\mathrm{PAG}}$, and $C_B$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem statement describes a simplified but standard model for the initial state of a chemically amplified resist after exposure and before significant deprotection during the PEB. The distinction between laboratory molarity (per total volume) and the species concentration in the free volume is a key, realistic aspect of modeling heterogeneous media. The assumptions of instantaneous neutralization and zero initial deprotection are common for establishing initial conditions in reaction-diffusion models of this process. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to derive a unique solution. No contradictions, ambiguities, or factual unsoundness are present.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n**Derivation of Initial Conditions**\n\nThe goal is to determine the initial values of the state variables $[H^{+}]_0$, $[B]_0$, and $f_0$ at the beginning of the PEB, denoted by $t=0$.\n\n1.  **Initial Deprotected Fraction, $f_0$**\n    The problem explicitly states that \"deprotection of protected polymer sites has not yet proceeded at $t=0^{+}$ of PEB\". The variable $f$ represents the fraction of deprotected sites. Therefore, its initial value must be zero.\n    $$f_0 = f(\\mathbf{r},0) = 0$$\n\n2.  **Initial Concentrations of Acid and Base, $[H^{+}]_0$ and $[B]_0$**\n    This requires a careful consideration of the volume basis for the concentrations and the stoichiometry of the neutralization reaction.\n\n    a. **Volume Basis Conversion:**\n    The given molarities, $C_{\\mathrm{PAG}}$ and $C_B$, are \"laboratory molarities\" defined per unit total film volume, let's call it $V_{\\text{total}}$. The state variables, $[H^{+}]$ and $[B]$, are concentrations defined per unit nonpolymer free volume, $V_{\\text{free}}$. The relationship between these volumes is given by the polymer volume fraction $\\phi_p$:\n    $$V_{\\text{free}} = (1 - \\phi_p) V_{\\text{total}}$$\n    All mobile species, including the generated acid ($H^{+}$) and the base quencher ($B$), are confined to this free volume.\n\n    b. **Initial Molarities in the Free Volume (before neutralization):**\n    First, we determine the number of moles of each species in a representative total volume $V_{\\text{total}}$.\n    - Moles of PAG: $n_{\\mathrm{PAG}} = C_{\\mathrm{PAG}} V_{\\text{total}}$\n    - Moles of base: $n_{B} = C_B V_{\\text{total}}$\n\n    Upon exposure, each PAG molecule generates one proton. Thus, the initial number of moles of acid available is $n_{H} = n_{\\mathrm{PAG}} = C_{\\mathrm{PAG}} V_{\\text{total}}$.\n\n    To find the initial concentrations of these species within the nonpolymer free volume where they reside, we must divide the number of moles by $V_{\\text{free}}$. Let us denote these pre-neutralization concentrations as $C_{H, \\text{initial}}$ and $C_{B, \\text{initial}}$.\n    $$C_{H, \\text{initial}} = \\frac{n_{H}}{V_{\\text{free}}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{PAG}} V_{\\text{total}}}{(1 - \\phi_p) V_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{PAG}}}{1 - \\phi_p}$$\n    $$C_{B, \\text{initial}} = \\frac{n_{B}}{V_{\\text{free}}} = \\frac{C_{B} V_{\\text{total}}}{(1 - \\phi_p) V_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{C_B}{1 - \\phi_p}$$\n    These are the effective concentrations of acid and base that are available to react at the start of the PEB.\n\n    c. **Stoichiometric Neutralization:**\n    The problem states that acid-base neutralization ($H^{+} + B \\rightarrow \\text{Salt}$) is instantaneous and occurs with $1{:}1$ stoichiometry. This is a limiting reactant problem. The species in lower concentration will be completely consumed.\n\n    - If $C_{H, \\text{initial}} > C_{B, \\text{initial}}$, acid is in excess. All the base is consumed.\n        The final concentration of acid is $[H^{+}]_0 = C_{H, \\text{initial}} - C_{B, \\text{initial}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{PAG}} - C_B}{1 - \\phi_p}$.\n        The final concentration of base is $[B]_0 = 0$.\n\n    - If $C_{B, \\text{initial}} > C_{H, \\text{initial}}$, base is in excess. All the acid is consumed.\n        The final concentration of acid is $[H^{+}]_0 = 0$.\n        The final concentration of base is $[B]_0 = C_{B, \\text{initial}} - C_{H, \\text{initial}} = \\frac{C_B - C_{\\mathrm{PAG}}}{1 - \\phi_p}$.\n\n    - If $C_{H, \\text{initial}} = C_{B, \\text{initial}}$, both reactants are completely consumed.\n        $[H^{+}]_0 = 0$ and $[B]_0 = 0$.\n\n    d. **General Expressions:**\n    These three cases can be compactly represented using the maximum function, $\\max(a, b)$, which returns the greater of $a$ and $b$.\n    The concentration of acid remaining is the initial amount minus the amount that reacted, but it cannot be negative.\n    $$[H^{+}]_0 = \\max\\left(0, C_{H, \\text{initial}} - C_{B, \\text{initial}}\\right) = \\max\\left(0, \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{PAG}}}{1 - \\phi_p} - \\frac{C_B}{1 - \\phi_p}\\right)$$\n    Since $1 - \\phi_p > 0$, we can write:\n    $$[H^{+}]_0 = \\frac{\\max(0, C_{\\mathrm{PAG}} - C_B)}{1 - \\phi_p}$$\n    Similarly, the concentration of base remaining is:\n    $$[B]_0 = \\max\\left(0, C_{B, \\text{initial}} - C_{H, \\text{initial}}\\right) = \\max\\left(0, \\frac{C_B}{1 - \\phi_p} - \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{PAG}}}{1 - \\phi_p}\\right)$$\n    $$[B]_0 = \\frac{\\max(0, C_B - C_{\\mathrm{PAG}})}{1 - \\phi_p}$$\n    These expressions are independent of the spatial coordinate $\\mathbf{r}$ within the exposed region, as the initial loading and exposure are assumed uniform therein.\n\n3.  **Final Result Vector**\n    Combining the results for $[H^{+}]_0$, $[B]_0$, and $f_0$, we form the required row vector:\n    $$\\big([H^{+}]_0 \\;\\; [B]_0 \\;\\; f_0\\big) = \\left(\\frac{\\max(0, C_{\\mathrm{PAG}} - C_B)}{1 - \\phi_p} \\;\\; \\frac{\\max(0, C_B - C_{\\mathrm{PAG}})}{1 - \\phi_p} \\;\\; 0\\right)$$",

The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe central task is to determine if and when the resist film vitrifies during the bake, and what the extent of deprotection is at that point. Vitrification is defined to occur at time $t_{v}$ when the mixture's glass transition temperature, $T_{g,\\mathrm{mix}}(t)$, rises to equal the bake temperature, $T_{b}$.

The problem specifies a system of monodisperse $f$-functional units undergoing random crosslinking, which is described by the Flory-Stockmayer theory of gelation.

The extent of reaction is the fraction of initial reactive sites that have been consumed by time $t$:\n$$p(t) = \\frac{[\\mathrm{A}]_0 - [\\mathrm{A}](t)}{[\\mathrm{A}]_0} = 1 - \\frac{[\\mathrm{A}](t)}{[\\mathrm{A}]_0}$$\nFrom the integrated rate law, we can express $[\\mathrm{A}](t)$ as:\n$$[\\mathrm{A}](t) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{1}{[\\mathrm{A}]_0} + 2 k_{\\mathrm{cross}} [\\mathrm{H}^+] t} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{A}]_0}{1 + 2 k_{\\mathrm{cross}} [\\mathrm{H}^+] [\\mathrm{A}]_0 t}$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $p(t)$:\n$$p(t) = 1 - \\frac{1}{1 + 2 k_{\\mathrm{cross}} [\\mathrm{H}^+] [\\mathrm{A}]_0 t} = \\frac{1 + 2 k_{\\mathrm{cross}} [\\mathrm{H}^+] [\\mathrm{A}]_0 t - 1}{1 + 2 k_{\\mathrm{cross}} [\\mathrm{H}^+] [\\mathrm{A}]_0 t} = \\frac{2 k_{\\mathrm{cross}} [\\mathrm{H}^+] [\\mathrm{A}]_0 t}{1 + 2 k_{\\mathrm{cross}} [\\mathrm{H}^+] [\\mathrm{A}]_0 t}$$\n\nGelation occurs at time $t_{\\mathrm{gel}}$ when $p(t_{\\mathrm{gel}}) = p_{\\mathrm{c}}$. We set up this equality and solve for $t_{\\mathrm{gel}}$:\n$$p_{\\mathrm{c}} = \\frac{2 k_{\\mathrm{cross}} [\\mathrm{H}^+] [\\mathrm{A}]_0 t_{\\mathrm{gel}}}{1 + 2 k_{\\mathrm{cross}} [\\mathrm{H}^+] [\\mathrm{A}]_0 t_{\\mathrm{gel}}}$$\n$$p_{\\mathrm{c}} (1 + 2 k_{\\mathrm{cross}} [\\mathrm{H}^+] [\\mathrm{A}]_0 t_{\\mathrm{gel}}) = 2 k_{\\mathrm{cross}} [\\mathrm{H}^+] [\\mathrm{A}]_0 t_{\\mathrm{gel}}$$\n$$p_{\\mathrm{c}} = 2 k_{\\mathrm{cross}} [\\mathrm{H}^+] [\\mathrm{A}]_0 t_{\\mathrm{gel}} - p_{\\mathrm{c}} (2 k_{\\mathrm{cross}} [\\mathrm{H}^+] [\\mathrm{A}]_0 t_{\\mathrm{gel}})$$\n$$p_{\\mathrm{c}} = (1 - p_{\\mathrm{c}}) (2 k_{\\mathrm{cross}} [\\mathrm{H}^+] [\\mathrm{A}]_0 t_{\\mathrm{gel}})$$\nSolving for $t_{\\mathrm{gel}}$ gives the general symbolic expression:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{gel}} = \\frac{p_{\\mathrm{c}}}{2(1 - p_{\\mathrm{c}}) k_{\\mathrm{cross}} [\\mathrm{H}^+] [\\mathrm{A}]_0}$$\nWe can substitute $p_c = \\frac{1}{f-1}$ into this expression to obtain a form dependent on functionality $f$:\n$$\\frac{p_{\\mathrm{c}}}{1-p_{\\mathrm{c}}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{f-1}}{1-\\frac{1}{f-1}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{f-1}}{\\frac{f-2}{f-1}} = \\frac{1}{f-2}$$\nThus, the time to gel is:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{gel}} = \\frac{1}{2(f-2) k_{\\mathrm{cross}} [\\mathrm{H}^+] [\\mathrm{A}]_0}$$\nFor the given case of $f=3$, this simplifies to:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{gel}} = \\frac{1}{2(3-2) k_{\\mathrm{cross}} [\\mathrm{H}^+] [\\mathrm{A}]_0} = \\frac{1}{2 k_{\\mathrm{cross}} [\\mathrm{H}^+] [\\mathrm{A}]_0}$$\n\nFinally, we evaluate this expression numerically using the provided parameters:\n$[\\mathrm{A}]_0 = 1.80 \\ \\mathrm{mol \\ L^{-1}}$\n$[\\mathrm{H}^+] = 3.00 \\ \\mathrm{mM} = 3.00 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{mol \\ L^{-1}}$\n$k_{\\mathrm{cross}} = 3.00 \\ \\mathrm{L^2 \\ mol^{-2} \\ s^{-1}}$\n\n$$t_{\\mathrm{gel}} = \\frac{1}{2 (3.00 \\ \\mathrm{L^2 \\ mol^{-2} \\ s^{-1}}) (3.00 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{mol \\ L^{-1}}) (1.80 \\ \\mathrm{mol \\ L^{-1}})}$$\nThe units in the denominator are $(\\mathrm{L^2 \\ mol^{-2} \\ s^{-1}}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{mol \\ L^{-1}}) \\cdot (\\mathrm{mol \\ L^{-1}}) = \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, so the unit for $t_{\\mathrm{gel}}$ is seconds, as expected.\n$$t_{\\mathrm{gel}} = \\frac{1}{2 \\times 3.00 \\times 3.00 \\times 1.80 \\times 10^{-3}} \\ \\mathrm{s}$$\n$$t_{\\mathrm{gel}} = \\frac{1}{0.0324} \\ \\mathrm{s} \\approx 30.86419... \\ \\mathrm{s}$$\nRounding to three significant figures, consistent with the input parameters, we get:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{gel}} = 30.9 \\ \\mathrm{s}$$",
