            "problem": "In advanced optical lithography for semiconductor manufacturing, imaging of periodic structures is governed by diffraction and interference in a projection system whose performance is constrained by the pupil of the lens. Consider a Deep Ultraviolet (DUV) immersion projection system whose illumination is provided by a spatially uniform, circular source that fills the entrance pupil of the projection lens up to a finite angular semi-radius. The imaging occurs in an immersion medium of refractive index $n$, and the projection lens defines a maximum pupil semi-angle beyond which no diffracted orders are transmitted.\n\nStarting from first principles of diffraction-limited imaging, specifically the Abbe theory of image formation and the definition of Numerical Aperture (NA), derive an expression for the partial coherence parameter (commonly denoted by $\\sigma$) in terms of the illumination source angular semi-radius and the projection lens pupil semi-angle, both measured in the same medium.

Angles are given in radians.",
            "solution": "The solution is divided into three parts: derivation, calculation, and interpretation.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Partial Coherence Parameter $\\sigma$**\n\nThe formation of an image in a projection system, according to the Abbe theory, is a two-step process: first, the object (photomask) diffracts the incident illumination into a spectrum of plane waves (diffraction orders); second, the projection lens collects a portion of this diffracted light within its pupil and re-interferes it to form the image on the wafer.\n\nThe extent of the collected diffracted orders is determined by the Numerical Aperture (NA) of the projection lens. The $\\text{NA}$ is defined as:\n$$\\text{NA} = n \\sin(\\theta_{\\text{max}})$$\nwhere $n$ is the refractive index of the medium in which imaging occurs and $\\theta_{\\text{max}}$ is the maximum semi-angle of the cone of light that can enter or exit the lens. For the projection lens, this angle is the pupil semi-angle, $\\theta_{p}$.\nThus, the numerical aperture of the projection lens is:\n$$\\text{NA}_{\\text{lens}} = n \\sin(\\theta_{p})$$\n\nThe illumination system is also characterized by a numerical aperture, which describes the range of angles over which the mask is illuminated. For a circular source with an angular semi-radius of $\\theta_{s}$, the numerical aperture of the illumination is:\n$$\\text{NA}_{\\text{illum}} = n \\sin(\\theta_{s})$$\n\nThe partial coherence parameter, $\\sigma$, is a dimensionless quantity that quantifies the degree of coherence of the illumination. It is defined as the ratio of the numerical aperture of the illumination system to the numerical aperture of the projection lens:\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{\\text{NA}_{\\text{illum}}}{\\text{NA}_{\\text{lens}}}$$\nThis ratio effectively compares the angular extent of the illumination source to the acceptance angle of the lens pupil, when both are projected onto the pupil plane.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\text{NA}_{\\text{illum}}$ and $\\text{NA}_{\\text{lens}}$ gives:\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{n \\sin(\\theta_{s})}{n \\sin(\\theta_{p})}$$\nSince both angles are measured in the same immersion medium of refractive index $n$, the refractive index cancels out. The final derived expression is:\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta_{s})}{\\sin(\\theta_{p})}$$\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of $\\sigma$**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- Illumination source angular semi-radius: $\\theta_{s} = \\frac{\\pi}{6}$ radians.\n- Projection lens maximum pupil semi-angle: $\\theta_{p} = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$ radians.\n\nFirst, we compute the sine of each angle:\n$$\\sin(\\theta_{s}) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$\\sin(\\theta_{p}) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$$\n\nNow, we substitute these values into the derived expression for $\\sigma$:\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{\\sin(\\theta_{s})}{\\sin(\\theta_{p})} = \\frac{1/2}{\\sqrt{3}/2} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$$\n\nTo obtain the numerical value, we compute the result and round to four significant figures as requested:\n$$\\sigma = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 0.577350269...$$\nRounding to four significant figures yields:\n$$\\sigma \\approx 0.5774$$\n\n**Part 3: Interpretation of the Effect on Imaging Contrast**\n\nThe computed value $\\sigma \\approx 0.5774$ represents a state of partial coherence. We are asked to compare the imaging contrast for a dense grating near the resolution limit under this condition with the limiting cases of fully coherent illumination ($\\sigma \\to 0$) and quasi-incoherent illumination (i.e., $\\sigma \\to 1$).\n\nImage contrast for a periodic structure arises from the interference of at least two diffraction orders ($0^{\\text{th}}$ and $\\pm 1^{\\text{st}}$ for a simple grating) collected by the lens pupil.\n\n- **Fully Coherent Illumination ($\\sigma \\to 0$)**: The illumination is a single, on-axis plane wave. The diffraction orders are discrete points in the pupil. If the $0^{\\text{th}}$ and $\\pm 1^{\\text{st}}$ orders are captured, they interfere with fixed phase relationships. This can produce the highest possible image contrast (modulation), potentially reaching $100\\%$. However, the resolution is limited, and this ideal contrast is highly sensitive to aberrations like defocus.\n\n- **Quasi-Incoherent Illumination ($\\sigma \\to 1$)**: The illumination source fills the entire pupil ($\\text{NA}_{\\text{illum}} \\approx \\text{NA}_{\\text{lens}}$). The final image is an intensity sum of images produced by each independent point on the source. For a grating near the resolution limit, many illumination angles will result in only the $0^{\\text{th}}$ order being captured, which contributes a uniform background intensity and does not form a pattern. This addition of background light severely degrades the overall image contrast, even though some off-axis points on the source might enhance resolution compared to the on-axis coherent case.\n\n- **Partial Coherence ($\\sigma \\approx 0.5774$)**: This is a practical compromise. The illumination source is extended but smaller than the pupil. Compared to the coherent case ($\\sigma \\to 0$), contrast is reduced. The reason is that interference is averaged over a continuous range of illumination angles. This averaging process blurs the sharp nulls of the ideal coherent interference pattern, thus reducing the peak-to-valley intensity difference (modulation). However, compared to the quasi-incoherent case ($\\sigma \\to 1$), the contrast is significantly higher. By limiting the source size ($\\sigma  1$), we exclude those illumination angles that contribute only background light and no pattern information. This preserves a substantial portion of the interference-based modulation while gaining some of the benefits of off-axis illumination, such as improved resolution for certain feature types and better depth of focus, which are critical for robust manufacturing processes.\n\nIn summary, the computed $\\sigma$ value provides a balance, sacrificing some of the maximal theoretical contrast of coherent imaging to achieve higher practical resolution and process stability compared to both the purely coherent and quasi-incoherent limits.",
