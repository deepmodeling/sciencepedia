            "problem": "A silicon wafer is implanted with light ions such that channeling is suppressed by a suitable pre-amorphization and tilt.

A full validation of the problem statement is required before proceeding.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- Electronic stopping power: $S_{e}(E) \\propto v(E)$\n- Nuclear stopping power: $S_{n}(E) \\propto \\sqrt{E}$\n- Ion speed at kinetic energy $E$: $v(E)$\n- Total stopping power definition: $S(E) \\equiv -\\,dE/dx$\n- Total stopping power composition: $S(E) = S_{e}(E) + S_{n}(E)$\n- Projected range definition: $R_{p}(E_{0}) \\equiv \\int_{0}^{E_{0}} \\frac{dE}{S(E)}$\n- Implantation energy: $E_{0}$\n- Kinematic relation for an ion of mass $m$: $v(E) = \\sqrt{2E/m}$\n- Calibration data: At $E_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{keV}$, the measured projected range is $R_{p}(E_{\\mathrm{ref}}) = 67\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n- Target for prediction: Calculate $R_{p}$ at $E_{0} = 75\\,\\mathrm{keV}$.\n- Additional task: Qualitatively describe the dependence of longitudinal straggle and higher moments on $E_{0}$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is evaluated against the validation criteria.\n\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is based on the Lindhard-Scharff-Schiøtt (LSS) theory for ion stopping, which is a cornerstone of ion implantation modeling. The assumptions $S_e \\propto v(E)$ and $S_n \\propto \\sqrt{E}$ are well-established approximations for light ions in specific energy regimes. The integral definition for range is fundamental to transport theory. The problem is scientifically sound within its stated approximations.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a clear a priori model for stopping power, a definition for the quantity to be calculated ($R_p$), and a calibration data point. This setup is sufficient and self-contained, allowing for a unique, stable solution.\n- **Objective:** The problem is stated in precise, quantitative terms, with clearly defined variables and relationships, free of subjective language.\n\nThe problem does not exhibit any flaws such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, contradiction, or ambiguity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe first step is to derive an explicit functional form for the total stopping power, $S(E)$. The problem states that the electronic stopping power $S_e(E)$ is proportional to the ion speed $v(E)$, and the nuclear stopping power $S_n(E)$ is proportional to the square root of the ion kinetic energy $E$. We can write these as:\n$S_e(E) = k_e v(E)$\n$S_n(E) = k_n \\sqrt{E}$\nwhere $k_e$ and $k_n$ are proportionality constants.\n\nThe problem provides the non-relativistic kinematic relation between speed and energy for an ion of mass $m$:\n$v(E) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2E}{m}}$\n\nWe substitute this expression for $v(E)$ into the equation for $S_e(E)$:\n$S_e(E) = k_e \\sqrt{\\frac{2E}{m}} = \\left( k_e \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{m}} \\right) \\sqrt{E}$\n\nThis shows that under the given assumptions, the electronic stopping power $S_e(E)$ is also proportional to $\\sqrt{E}$. Let's define a new constant $c_e = k_e \\sqrt{2/m}$. Then, $S_e(E) = c_e \\sqrt{E}$.\n\nThe total stopping power $S(E)$ is the sum of the electronic and nuclear components:\n$S(E) = S_e(E) + S_n(E) = c_e \\sqrt{E} + k_n \\sqrt{E} = (c_e + k_n)\\sqrt{E}$\n\nLet's combine the constants into a single effective proportionality constant $C = c_e + k_n$. The total stopping power is thus:\n$S(E) = C \\sqrt{E}$\n\nNow we can calculate the projected range $R_p$ for an initial implantation energy $E_0$ using the provided integral definition:\n$R_p(E_0) = \\int_{0}^{E_0} \\frac{dE}{S(E)} = \\int_{0}^{E_0} \\frac{dE}{C\\sqrt{E}}$\n\nWe can evaluate this integral:\n$R_p(E_0) = \\frac{1}{C} \\int_{0}^{E_0} E^{-1/2} \\, dE = \\frac{1}{C} \\left[ \\frac{E^{1/2}}{1/2} \\right]_{0}^{E_0} = \\frac{1}{C} [2\\sqrt{E}]_{0}^{E_0} = \\frac{2\\sqrt{E_0}}{C}$\n\nThis is the key symbolic relation for the projected range. It shows that, under the given assumptions, the projected range $R_p$ scales with the square root of the implantation energy $E_0$:\n$R_p(E_0) \\propto \\sqrt{E_0}$\n\nTo make a numerical prediction, we do not need to find the value of $C$. Instead, we can use the scaling relationship and the provided calibration data point. Let $K = 2/C$ be the overall constant of proportionality, such that $R_p(E_0) = K\\sqrt{E_0}$. We can form a ratio:\n$\\frac{R_p(E_0)}{R_p(E_{\\mathrm{ref}})} = \\frac{K\\sqrt{E_0}}{K\\sqrt{E_{\\mathrm{ref}}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{E_0}{E_{\\mathrm{ref}}}}$\n\nThis allows us to calculate the projected range at the new energy $E_0 = 75\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ using the reference values $E_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 20\\,\\mathrm{keV}$ and $R_p(E_{\\mathrm{ref}}) = 67\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n$R_p(75\\,\\mathrm{keV}) = R_p(20\\,\\mathrm{keV}) \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{75\\,\\mathrm{keV}}{20\\,\\mathrm{keV}}}$\n$R_p(75\\,\\mathrm{keV}) = (67\\,\\mathrm{nm}) \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{75}{20}} = (67\\,\\mathrm{nm}) \\times \\sqrt{3.75}$\n$R_p(75\\,\\mathrm{keV}) \\approx (67\\,\\mathrm{nm}) \\times 1.93649167 \\approx 129.74494\\,\\mathrm{nm}$\n\nRounding to four significant figures as requested, the predicted projected range is $129.7\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n\nFinally, a brief qualitative comment on the dependence of longitudinal straggle and higher moments on the implantation energy $E_0$ is required. The moments of the depth distribution (range, straggle, skewness, etc.) are determined by the statistical nature of the ion's energy loss process, which consists of a large number of discrete collisions.\n\n1.  **Longitudinal Straggle ($\\Delta R_p$)**: This is the standard deviation of the depth distribution, measuring its width. The variance ($\\Delta R_p^2$) is a result of statistical fluctuations in the number and character of collisions. A simple application of the central limit theorem suggests that the variance in the total energy loss is proportional to the mean path length, and thus to the range $R_p$. Therefore, one would expect $\\Delta R_p^2 \\propto R_p$. Since we found $R_p \\propto \\sqrt{E_0}$, this implies that the variance scales as $\\Delta R_p^2 \\propto \\sqrt{E_0}$, and the straggle itself scales as $\\Delta R_p \\propto E_0^{1/4}$. The straggle increases with implantation energy, but more slowly than the range. This means the relative straggle, $\\Delta R_p / R_p \\propto E_0^{1/4} / E_0^{1/2} = E_0^{-1/4}$, decreases as energy increases. The distribution becomes relatively narrower at higher energies.\n\n2.  **Higher Moments (Skewness $\\gamma_1$, Excess Kurtosis $\\kappa$)**: Skewness (third moment) describes the asymmetry of the distribution, while kurtosis (fourth moment) describes its \"tailedness\". For ion implantation, the distribution is typically asymmetric (skewed) due to the possibility of a few large-angle nuclear scattering events that can significantly shorten an ion's path, creating a tail toward the surface. As the implantation energy $E_0$ increases, the total number of collisions an ion undergoes also increases significantly. According to the central limit theorem, the sum of a large number of independent random variables (the energy losses in individual collisions) will tend toward a normal (Gaussian) distribution. A Gaussian distribution is perfectly symmetric ($\\gamma_1 = 0$) and has zero excess kurtosis ($\\kappa = 0$). Therefore, as $E_0$ increases, the ion distribution is expected to become more Gaussian-like. This implies that the magnitudes of both the skewness and the excess kurtosis will decrease with increasing implantation energy, approaching zero in the high-energy limit.",

The problem is a standard application of error propagation in a physical model.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The problem provides a clear objective, all necessary mathematical formulae ($R(E_0)$, $S(E)$), all required numerical constants ($A$, $E_0$, $\\sigma_E$), and specifies the approximation method to be used (first-order Taylor series). The task is unambiguous and leads to a unique, stable, and meaningful solution.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective language without any subjective or opinion-based content.\n\n**1.3. Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and complete. It passes all validation criteria. Therefore, the problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation of the Solution\n\nThe projected range, $R(E)$, as a function of the initial ion energy $E$, is defined by the integral of the reciprocal of the stopping power, $S(E)$.\nThe stopping power is given as $S(E') = A\\,(E')^{1/2}$. We use $E'$ as the integration variable to avoid confusion with the upper limit of integration $E$.\nThe range for an ion with initial energy $E$ is:\n$$\nR(E) = \\int_{0}^{E} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}E'}{S(E')} = \\int_{0}^{E} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}E'}{A\\,(E')^{1/2}}\n$$\nWe can pull the constant $A$ out of the integral:\n$$\nR(E) = \\frac{1}{A} \\int_{0}^{E} (E')^{-1/2} \\mathrm{d}E'\n$$\nPerforming the integration:\n$$\nR(E) = \\frac{1}{A} \\left[ \\frac{(E')^{1/2}}{1/2} \\right]_{0}^{E} = \\frac{1}{A} [2(E')^{1/2}]_{0}^{E} = \\frac{2}{A} (E^{1/2} - 0^{1/2})\n$$\nThis yields the explicit function for the projected range as a function of energy:\n$$\nR(E) = \\frac{2}{A} E^{1/2}\n$$\nThe problem states that the ion energy $E$ is a random variable with mean $E_0$ and a small standard deviation $\\sigma_E$. We need to find the corresponding standard deviation of the range, $\\sigma_R$. We use the method of propagation of uncertainty, which is equivalent to a first-order Taylor series approximation for the function $R(E)$ around the mean energy $E_0$:\n$$\nR(E) \\approx R(E_0) + \\left. \\frac{\\mathrm{d}R}{\\mathrm{d}E} \\right|_{E=E_0} (E - E_0)\n$$\nFor a linear relationship of the form $Y = c_0 + c_1 X$, the variance of $Y$ is related to the variance of $X$ by $\\mathrm{Var}(Y) = c_1^2 \\mathrm{Var}(X)$. In our case, $Y$ is $R(E)$, $X$ is $E$, and the constant $c_1$ is the derivative $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}R}{\\mathrm{d}E}$ evaluated at the mean $E_0$. The variances are $\\sigma_R^2$ and $\\sigma_E^2$. Thus, we have:\n$$\n\\sigma_R^2 \\approx \\left( \\left. \\frac{\\mathrm{d}R}{\\mathrm{d}E} \\right|_{E=E_0} \\right)^2 \\sigma_E^2\n$$\nTaking the square root of both sides gives the standard deviation:\n$$\n\\sigma_R \\approx \\left| \\left. \\frac{\\mathrm{d}R}{\\mathrm{d}E} \\right|_{E=E_0} \\right| \\sigma_E\n$$\nNext, we calculate the derivative of $R(E)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}R}{\\mathrm{d}E} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}E} \\left( \\frac{2}{A} E^{1/2} \\right) = \\frac{2}{A} \\left( \\frac{1}{2} E^{-1/2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{A E^{1/2}}\n$$\nAs a consistency check, note that $\\frac{1}{A E^{1/2}} = \\frac{1}{S(E)}$, which matches the fundamental definition $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}R}{\\mathrm{d}E} = \\frac{1}{S(E)}$.\nNow, we evaluate this derivative at the mean energy $E_0$:\n$$\n\\left. \\frac{\\mathrm{d}R}{\\mathrm{d}E} \\right|_{E=E_0} = \\frac{1}{A E_0^{1/2}}\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\sigma_R$:\n$$\n\\sigma_R = \\frac{1}{A E_0^{1/2}} \\sigma_E\n$$\nThe absolute value is dropped since all quantities ($A$, $E_0$, $\\sigma_E$) are positive. This is the symbolic expression for the range straggling contribution from the source energy spread.\n\n### Step 3: Numerical Evaluation\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- $E_0 = 50\\,\\mathrm{keV}$\n- $\\sigma_E = 1.50\\,\\mathrm{keV}$\n- $A = 120\\,\\mathrm{keV}^{1/2}/\\mu\\mathrm{m}$\n\nSubstitute these values into the derived expression for $\\sigma_R$:\n$$\n\\sigma_R = \\frac{1.50\\,\\mathrm{keV}}{(120\\,\\mathrm{keV}^{1/2}/\\mu\\mathrm{m}) \\times (50\\,\\mathrm{keV})^{1/2}}\n$$\nThe units are consistent: $(\\mathrm{keV}) / [(\\mathrm{keV}^{1/2}/\\mu\\mathrm{m}) \\times \\mathrm{keV}^{1/2}] = (\\mathrm{keV}) / (\\mathrm{keV}/\\mu\\mathrm{m}) = \\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\nNow we calculate the numerical value:\n$$\n\\sigma_R = \\frac{1.50}{120 \\sqrt{50}} \\, \\mu\\mathrm{m} = \\frac{1.50}{120 \\times 7.0710678...} \\, \\mu\\mathrm{m}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_R = \\frac{1.50}{848.528137...} \\, \\mu\\mathrm{m} \\approx 0.0017677669 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{m}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in nanometers (nm). We use the conversion factor $1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 1000\\,\\mathrm{nm}$:\n$$\n\\sigma_R \\approx 0.0017677669 \\, \\mu\\mathrm{m} \\times \\frac{1000\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}} = 1.7677669\\,\\mathrm{nm}\n$$\nFinally, we round the result to four significant figures. The fifth significant figure is $7$, so we round up the fourth digit.\n$$\n\\sigma_R \\approx 1.768\\,\\mathrm{nm}\n$$",
            "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.768}$$"
