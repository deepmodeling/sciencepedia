Within the Binary Collision Approximation (BCA), model the interaction as a two-body elastic collision governed by conservation of linear momentum and kinetic energy. Using these fundamentals, first derive the maximum energy $T_{\\max}$ that can be transferred to the silicon atom in a head-on collision. Next, under Rutherford kinematics for elastic scattering, assume the scattering is characterized by the center-of-mass scattering angle $\\theta$ and derive the angular dependence of the transferred energy $T(\\theta)$. For a grazing collision with $\\theta=5^\\circ$, compute the energy transferred to the silicon atom, and then report the ratio $R=T(\\theta)/T_{\\max}$ as a dimensionless number. Express any energies you compute in electronvolts (eV). Round the final ratio $R$ to four significant figures. The final reported result must be $R$ only, with no units.",
            "solution": "The Binary Collision Approximation (BCA) models the ion–target interaction as a two-body elastic collision where the target atom is initially at rest. The base principles are conservation of linear momentum and conservation of kinetic energy. Let the projectile (arsenic) have mass $m_1$ and initial speed $v$, so its initial kinetic energy is $E_0=\\frac{1}{2}m_1 v^2$. The target (silicon) has mass $m_2$ and is initially at rest.\n\nMaximum energy transfer occurs in a head-on, one-dimensional elastic collision. For such a collision, solving the conservation laws yields the well-known post-collision velocities\n$$\nv_1'=\\frac{m_1-m_2}{m_1+m_2}\\,v,\\qquad\nv_2'=\\frac{2m_1}{m_1+m_2}\\,v,\n$$\nwhere $v_1'$ and $v_2'$ are the projectile and target velocities after the collision. The energy transferred to the target (the recoil energy) is\n$$\nT_{\\max}=\\frac{1}{2}m_2\\,v_2'^2=\\frac{1}{2}m_2\\left(\\frac{2m_1}{m_1+m_2}v\\right)^2\n= \\frac{4 m_1 m_2}{(m_1+m_2)^2}\\,\\frac{1}{2}m_1 v^2\n= \\frac{4 m_1 m_2}{(m_1+m_2)^2}\\,E_0.\n$$\nThis shows the head-on kinematic factor $\\frac{4 m_1 m_2}{(m_1+m_2)^2}$ multiplies the incident energy.\n\nFor a general elastic scattering under a central force (Rutherford kinematics), it is convenient to work in the center-of-mass (CM) frame. In the CM frame, the magnitudes of the velocities are unchanged by the collision; only directions are rotated by the CM scattering angle $\\theta$. The geometry of the momentum change in the CM frame implies that the energy transferred to the target in the laboratory frame scales with $\\sin^2(\\theta/2)$ relative to the head-on maximum. Specifically, the recoil energy as a function of the CM scattering angle is\n$$\nT(\\theta) = T_{\\max}\\,\\sin^2\\!\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right),\n$$\nwhich recovers $T(0)=0$ (no scattering) and $T(\\pi)=T_{\\max}$ (backscattering in CM).\n\nWe now compute the numerical values.

            "problem": "An energetic ion traverses crystalline silicon and is modeled using the Binary Collision Approximation (BCA), in which the ion undergoes successive, uncorrelated binary encounters with target atoms.

            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and self-contained, providing the necessary definitions and data for a complete solution. It requests a derivation from first principles followed by a numerical calculation, which is a standard and valid approach in physics and engineering education. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe problem asks for the mean free path, $\\lambda$, which is the average distance an ion travels before its first \"event,\" defined as a scattering collision with an angle $\\Theta \\ge \\Theta_{\\min}$. The total cross section for such an event is given as $\\sigma(\\Theta_{\\min})$, which we will denote as $\\sigma$ for brevity.\n\nOur derivation starts from two premises: (i) the geometric definition of cross section and (ii) the assumption of rare, independent collisions.\n\nConsider a thin, homogeneous slab of silicon with a frontal area $A$ and an infinitesimal thickness $dx$. The volume of this slab is $dV = A\\,dx$. Given an atomic number density $n$, the number of silicon atoms within this slab is $dN = n\\,dV = nA\\,dx$.\n\nFrom its geometric definition, the cross section $\\sigma$ represents the effective target area of a single silicon atom for the specified scattering event. An event occurs if the ion's trajectory passes through this area. Under the assumption of rare collisions, the material is dilute enough that the effective areas of individual atoms within the slab do not overlap. Therefore, the total effective area for a collision presented by all atoms in the slab is the number of atoms multiplied by the cross section per atom:\n$$\ndA_{\\text{eff}} = dN \\cdot \\sigma = (nA\\,dx)\\sigma\n$$\nThe probability, $dP_{\\text{coll}}$, that an ion traversing this slab will undergo a collision is the ratio of the total effective area to the total area of the slab:\n$$\ndP_{\\text{coll}} = \\frac{dA_{\\text{eff}}}{A} = \\frac{nA\\sigma\\,dx}{A} = n\\sigma\\,dx\n$$\nNow, let $P(x)$ be the probability that an ion has traveled a distance $x$ into the material *without* undergoing a collision. For an ion to travel a distance $x+dx$ without a collision, it must first travel a distance $x$ without a collision and then travel the additional distance $dx$ without a collision. Since collisions are independent events, we can multiply their probabilities. The probability of *not* colliding in the interval $dx$ is $(1 - dP_{\\text{coll}}) = (1 - n\\sigma\\,dx)$.\nThus, the survival probability to distance $x+dx$ is:\n$$\nP(x+dx) = P(x) \\cdot (1 - n\\sigma\\,dx)\n$$\nRearranging this equation gives:\n$$\nP(x+dx) - P(x) = -P(x)n\\sigma\\,dx\n$$\nDividing by $dx$ yields:\n$$\n\\frac{P(x+dx) - P(x)}{dx} = -n\\sigma P(x)\n$$\nTaking the limit as $dx \\to 0$ gives the differential equation for the survival probability:\n$$\n\\frac{dP(x)}{dx} = -n\\sigma P(x)\n$$\nThis is a first-order linear ordinary differential equation. We solve it by separation of variables, subject to the initial condition that the ion has a $100\\%$ probability of having survived before it enters the material, i.e., $P(0) = 1$.\n$$\n\\int_{1}^{P(x)} \\frac{dP'}{P'} = \\int_{0}^{x} -n\\sigma \\,dx'\n$$\n$$\n\\ln(P(x)) - \\ln(1) = -n\\sigma x\n$$\n$$\nP(x) = \\exp(-n\\sigma x)\n$$\nThis expression gives the probability of traveling a distance $x$ without a collision. To find the mean free path, we need the probability density function, $p(x)$, for the first collision occurring at distance $x$. The probability that the first collision occurs within the infinitesimal interval $[x, x+dx]$ is the probability of surviving up to $x$, $P(x)$, multiplied by the probability of colliding in the subsequent interval $dx$, which is $n\\sigma\\,dx$.\n$$\np(x)dx = P(x) \\cdot (n\\sigma\\,dx) = \\exp(-n\\sigma x) n\\sigma\\,dx\n$$\nSo, the probability density function is $p(x) = n\\sigma \\exp(-n\\sigma x)$, which is the exponential distribution.\n\nThe mean free path, $\\lambda$, is the expected value of the distance $x$ to the first collision:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\langle x \\rangle = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} x \\, p(x) \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} x (n\\sigma \\exp(-n\\sigma x)) \\, dx\n$$\nWe solve this integral using integration by parts, with $u=x$ and $dv = n\\sigma \\exp(-n\\sigma x) \\, dx$. This gives $du=dx$ and $v = -\\exp(-n\\sigma x)$.\n$$\n\\lambda = \\left[ -x \\exp(-n\\sigma x) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty} - \\int_{0}^{\\infty} (-\\exp(-n\\sigma x)) \\, dx\n$$\nThe first term evaluates to $0$ at both limits ($0$ for $x=0$, and $\\lim_{x\\to\\infty} -x \\exp(-ax) = 0$ for $a  0$).\n$$\n\\lambda = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\exp(-n\\sigma x) \\, dx = \\left[ -\\frac{1}{n\\sigma} \\exp(-n\\sigma x) \\right]_{0}^{\\infty}\n$$\n$$\n\\lambda = \\left( 0 \\right) - \\left( -\\frac{1}{n\\sigma} \\exp(0) \\right) = \\frac{1}{n\\sigma}\n$$\nThis is the derived expression for the mean free path, $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{n\\sigma(\\Theta_{\\min})}$.\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression numerically. The provided values are:\n$n = 5.0 \\times 10^{22}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$\n$\\sigma = 2.0 \\times 10^{-16}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^2$\n\nThe problem requires a final answer with three significant figures. The input values are given with two. To meet the output requirement, we will interpret the inputs as being precise to at least three significant figures, i.e., $n = 5.00 \\times 10^{22}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ and $\\sigma = 2.00 \\times 10^{-16}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^2$.\n\nFirst, we compute the product $n\\sigma$:\n$$\nn\\sigma = (5.00 \\times 10^{22}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-3}) \\times (2.00 \\times 10^{-16}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^2) = 10.00 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1} = 1.00 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\n$$\nNow, we calculate the mean free path $\\lambda$:\n$$\n\\lambda = \\frac{1}{n\\sigma} = \\frac{1}{1.00 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{cm}\n$$\nFinally, we must convert this result to nanometers. The conversion factor is $1\\ \\mathrm{cm} = 10^7\\ \\mathrm{nm}$.\n$$\n\\lambda = (1.00 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{cm}) \\times \\left( \\frac{10^7\\ \\mathrm{nm}}{1\\ \\mathrm{cm}} \\right) = 1.00\\ \\mathrm{nm}\n$$\nThe calculated mean free path, rounded to three significant figures, is $1.00$ nanometer.",
