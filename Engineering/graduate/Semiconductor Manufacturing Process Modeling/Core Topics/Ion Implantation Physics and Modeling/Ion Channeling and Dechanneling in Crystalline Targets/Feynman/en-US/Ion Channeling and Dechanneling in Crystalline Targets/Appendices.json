            "problem": "In ion implantation for semiconductor manufacturing process modeling, controlling planar channeling in crystalline silicon is essential to achieve accurate dopant profiles. Consider a high-energy ion incident on crystalline silicon, entering with a small angle relative to a family of lattice planes indexed by Miller indices $hkl$. In the continuum approximation, the ion experiences a one-dimensional planar potential $U(x)$ arising from the periodic distribution of atoms. For small entrance angles, the transverse energy is conserved and given by $E_{\\perp} = U(x) + \\tfrac{1}{2} m v^{2} \\psi^{2}$, where $m$ is the ion mass, $v$ is its speed, and $\\psi$ is its angle relative to the plane. Planar channeling occurs when the transverse energy is below the interplanar barrier height $U_{b}$.\n\nAssume the kinetic energy is $E = \\tfrac{1}{2} m v^{2}$ and that the barrier height $U_{b}$ is well-approximated as inversely proportional to the interplanar spacing, $U_{b}^{(hkl)} \\propto 1/d_{hkl}$, consistent with the continuum planar potential built from Thomas-Fermi (TF) screened atomic interactions and the areal atomic density scaling of the plane. For a cubic crystal with lattice constant $a$, the interplanar spacing is $d_{hkl} = a/\\sqrt{h^{2}+k^{2}+l^{2}}$.\n\nUsing only these fundamentals, derive the expression for the planar critical angle $\\psi_{c}^{(hkl)}$ via the criterion for channeling at the barrier and obtain the ratio $\\psi_{c}^{(110)}/\\psi_{c}^{(100)}$ for silicon. Express the final ratio as a single closed-form analytic expression. No numerical rounding is required, and no units are needed because the ratio is dimensionless.",
            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the ratio of planar critical angles for channeling, $\\psi_{c}^{(110)}/\\psi_{c}^{(100)}$, in a cubic crystal like silicon. The derivation will proceed from the fundamental principles provided in the problem statement.\n\nFirst, we begin with the expression for the conservation of transverse energy, $E_{\\perp}$, for an ion with kinetic energy $E = \\tfrac{1}{2} m v^{2}$ traveling at a small angle $\\psi$ relative to a crystal plane:\n$$E_{\\perp} = U(x) + \\tfrac{1}{2} m v^{2} \\psi^{2} = U(x) + E \\psi^{2}$$\nHere, $U(x)$ is the one-dimensional planar potential, and $x$ is the transverse distance from the center of the channel between two adjacent planes.\n\nThe planar critical angle, $\\psi_{c}$, is defined by the condition where an ion, entering the crystal at the center of the channel (where the potential is at its minimum, which we can define as $U(x=0) = 0$), has just enough initial transverse kinetic energy to overcome the potential barrier of the channel, $U_{b}$. This sets the limit for channeling. The condition is therefore established by equating the initial transverse energy, which is purely kinetic for an ion entering at $x=0$, to the barrier height $U_{b}^{(hkl)}$ for the specific family of planes $\\{hkl\\}$:\n$$E (\\psi_{c}^{(hkl)})^{2} = U_{b}^{(hkl)}$$\nSolving for the critical angle $\\psi_{c}^{(hkl)}$ gives:\n$$\\psi_{c}^{(hkl)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{U_{b}^{(hkl)}}{E}}$$\n\nThe problem states that the barrier height $U_{b}^{(hkl)}$ is inversely proportional to the interplanar spacing $d_{hkl}$. We can express this relationship with a constant of proportionality, $K$:\n$$U_{b}^{(hkl)} = \\frac{K}{d_{hkl}}$$\nThe constant $K$ encapsulates details of the ion-atom interaction and the areal density of atoms in the plane, which are assumed to be independent of the specific $(hkl)$ orientation in this simplified model.\n\nSubstituting this expression for the barrier height into the equation for the critical angle, we get:\n$$\\psi_{c}^{(hkl)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{K}{E \\cdot d_{hkl}}}$$\nThis equation shows that the critical angle is inversely proportional to the square root of the interplanar spacing, $\\psi_{c}^{(hkl)} \\propto (d_{hkl})^{-1/2}$.\n\nWe are asked to find the ratio $\\psi_{c}^{(110)}/\\psi_{c}^{(100)}$. Using the derived relationship, we can write the ratio as:\n$$\\frac{\\psi_{c}^{(110)}}{\\psi_{c}^{(100)}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{K}{E \\cdot d_{110}}}}{\\sqrt{\\frac{K}{E \\cdot d_{100}}}}$$\nThe constants $K$ and $E$ cancel out, leaving:\n$$\\frac{\\psi_{c}^{(110)}}{\\psi_{c}^{(100)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{d_{100}}{d_{110}}}$$\n\nNext, we use the provided formula for the interplanar spacing in a cubic crystal with lattice constant $a$:\n$$d_{hkl} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{h^{2}+k^{2}+l^{2}}}$$\nWe calculate the spacings for the $(100)$ and $(110)$ planes.\nFor the $(100)$ planes, $(h,k,l) = (1,0,0)$:\n$$d_{100} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{1^{2}+0^{2}+0^{2}}} = \\frac{a}{1} = a$$\nFor the $(110)$ planes, $(h,k,l) = (1,1,0)$:\n$$d_{110} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{1^{2}+1^{2}+0^{2}}} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\n\nFinally, we substitute these expressions for $d_{100}$ and $d_{110}$ into the ratio equation:\n$$\\frac{\\psi_{c}^{(110)}}{\\psi_{c}^{(100)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}}}}$$\nSimplifying the expression:\n$$\\frac{\\psi_{c}^{(110)}}{\\psi_{c}^{(100)}} = \\sqrt{a \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{a}} = \\sqrt{\\sqrt{2}}$$\nThis can be written in exponent form as:\n$$\\sqrt{\\sqrt{2}} = (2^{1/2})^{1/2} = 2^{(1/2) \\cdot (1/2)} = 2^{1/4}$$\nThe resulting ratio is a dimensionless constant, as expected.",

There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or unsound premises.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A full solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe core principle governing the motion of a channeled ion within the continuum approximation is the conservation of its transverse energy, $E_{\\perp}$. The problem provides the definition of transverse energy for a small incidence angle $\\psi$ with respect to the channeling plane:\n$$E_{\\perp} = E_{\\text{kin,T}} + U(x)$$\nwhere $E_{\\text{kin,T}}$ is the transverse kinetic energy and $U(x)$ is the continuum potential as a function of the distance $x$ from the midplane between two atomic planes. For small angles, the transverse kinetic energy is given by $E_{\\text{kin,T}} = \\frac{1}{2} E_{\\text{kin}} \\psi^2$, where $E_{\\text{kin}}$ is the total kinetic energy of the ion. Thus, the expression for transverse energy is:\n$$E_{\\perp} = \\frac{1}{2} E_{\\text{kin}} \\psi^2 + U(x)$$\nThe problem specifies that the ion beam is decelerated by an energy $\\Delta E$ just before entering the crystal. If the initial kinetic energy far from the surface is $E$, the kinetic energy of the ion as it crosses the surface is $E_{\\text{kin}} = E - \\Delta E$. The incidence angle $\\psi$ is also measured at the surface. Therefore, the total kinetic energy relevant for the channeling dynamics inside the crystal is $E - \\Delta E$.\n\nThe critical channeling angle, $\\psi_{c}$, which also represents the angular acceptance half-angle, is defined for an ion entering the crystal at the midplane. The continuum potential is minimal at the midplane, which we can set to zero by convention: $U(x=0) = 0$. For an ion incident at the critical angle $\\psi_{c}$, its initial transverse energy is purely kinetic:\n$$E_{\\perp, \\text{initial}} = \\frac{1}{2} E_{\\text{kin}} \\psi_{c}^2 + U(0) = \\frac{1}{2} E_{\\text{kin}} \\psi_{c}^2$$\nFor this ion to be channeled (i.e., reflected by the atomic planes), its trajectory must have a turning point before it reaches an atomic plane. The critical condition corresponds to the trajectory where the ion just reaches the potential barrier of the atomic plane, which has a height $U_{0}$. At this turning point, the ion's transverse velocity is momentarily zero, so its transverse kinetic energy is zero. The transverse energy at the turning point is purely potential:\n$$E_{\\perp, \\text{turning}} = U_{0}$$\nBy the conservation of transverse energy, $E_{\\perp, \\text{initial}} = E_{\\perp, \\text{turning}}$. Therefore:\n$$\\frac{1}{2} E_{\\text{kin}} \\psi_{c}^2 = U_{0}$$\nSolving for the critical angle $\\psi_{c}$ as a function of the ion's kinetic energy $E_{\\text{kin}}$ gives the general formula:\n$$\\psi_{c}(E_{\\text{kin}}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 U_{0}}{E_{\\text{kin}}}}$$\nWe now apply this general result to the two scenarios.\n\nFirst, consider the case without deceleration, where the kinetic energy at the surface would be $E$. The critical angle is:\n$$\\psi_{c}(E) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 U_{0}}{E}}$$\nSecond, consider the specified case with a deceleration of $\\Delta E$. The kinetic energy at the surface is $E_{\\text{kin}} = E - \\Delta E$. The new, modified critical angle is:\n$$\\psi_{c}(E - \\Delta E) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 U_{0}}{E - \\Delta E}}$$\nThis equation shows how the deceleration modifies the critical angle. A decrease in kinetic energy from $E$ to $E - \\Delta E$ results in an increase of the critical angle $\\psi_c$.\n\nNow, we perform the numerical evaluation using the given values:\n-   Initial kinetic energy: $E = 80\\,\\mathrm{keV} = 8 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n-   Deceleration energy: $\\Delta E = 10\\,\\mathrm{keV} = 1 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n-   Planar potential barrier: $U_{0} = 22\\,\\mathrm{eV}$\n\nThe kinetic energy of the ions at the surface is:\n$$E' = E - \\Delta E = 80\\,\\mathrm{keV} - 10\\,\\mathrm{keV} = 70\\,\\mathrm{keV} = 7 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{eV}$$\nThe new critical angle, $\\psi_{c}(E - \\Delta E)$, is:\n$$\\psi_{c}(E - \\Delta E) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 22\\,\\mathrm{eV}}{7 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{eV}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{44}{70000}} \\approx 0.0250713\\,\\mathrm{rad}$$\nTo express this in milliradians (mrad), we multiply by $1000$:\n$$\\psi_{c}(E - \\Delta E) \\approx 25.0713\\,\\mathrm{mrad}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\psi_{c}(E - \\Delta E) = 25.07\\,\\mathrm{mrad}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the increase in the critical angle, $\\Delta \\psi_c$. First, we compute the critical angle for the original energy $E$ (without deceleration):\n$$\\psi_{c}(E) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\times 22\\,\\mathrm{eV}}{8 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{eV}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{44}{80000}} \\approx 0.0234521\\,\\mathrm{rad}$$\nIn milliradians, this is:\n$$\\psi_{c}(E) \\approx 23.4521\\,\\mathrm{mrad}$$\nThe increase of the angular acceptance half-angle is defined as $\\Delta \\psi_{c} = \\psi_{c}(E - \\Delta E) - \\psi_{c}(E)$:\n$$\\Delta \\psi_{c} \\approx 25.0713\\,\\mathrm{mrad} - 23.4521\\,\\mathrm{mrad} = 1.6192\\,\\mathrm{mrad}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get $\\Delta \\psi_{c} = 1.619\\,\\mathrm{mrad}$.\n\nThe final results are the new critical angle $\\psi_{c}(E - \\Delta E)$ and the increase $\\Delta \\psi_{c}$.",

The height of this potential barrier, $U_0$, for a plane is derived by integrating the screened Coulomb potential of individual atoms over the planar area. Given an areal atomic density $n_p$ (atoms per unit area), the barrier height is estimated by the formula:\n    $$U_0 \\approx 2 \\pi n_p Z_1 Z_2 k a$$\n    where $Z_1$ is the ion atomic number, $Z_2$ is the target atomic number, $k = 14.3996 \\, \\text{eV}\\cdot\\text{Å}$ is the electrostatic constant, and $a$ is the screening length. The areal density $n_p$ is calculated from the volume atomic density $n_v$ and the interplanar spacing $d$ as $n_p = n_v d$.\n\n2.  **Critical Channeling Angle ($\\psi_c$):** An ion will be guided, or \"channeled,\" by the planar potential if its total transverse energy is less than the potential barrier height $U_0$. The critical angle $\\psi_c$ is the maximum angle of incidence for which this holds. For an ion entering the channel center, the transverse energy is purely kinetic, $E_{\\perp} \\approx \\frac{1}{2}E \\psi^2$. Equating this to the barrier height, $\\frac{1}{2}E \\psi_c^2 = U_0$, gives the critical angle in radians as specified in the prompt:\n    $$\\psi_c \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{2 U_0}{E}}$$\n    The kinetic energy $E$ of the ion must be in electronvolts ($eV$). The result, obtained in radians, must be converted to degrees.\n\n3.  **Minimum Yield ($\\chi_{\\text{min}}$):** In a perfectly aligned crystal, the incident ion flux is steered away from the atomic rows and planes, drastically reducing the probability of close-encounter events like backscattering or nuclear reactions. The ratio of the yield of such events in an aligned direction to that in a random direction is the channeling yield. The minimum yield, $\\chi_{\\text{min}}$, is the lowest value of this ratio, occurring at perfect alignment. It is non-zero primarily due to thermal vibrations of the target atoms, which allows some ions to approach the atomic nuclei. A simple geometric estimate for $\\chi_{\\text{min}}$ in planar channeling considers the fraction of the channel area \"blocked\" by the thermal vibrations. This is given by:\n    $$\\chi_{\\text{min}} \\approx \\frac{2 u_1}{d}$$\n    where $u_1$ is the one-dimensional root-mean-square (RMS) thermal displacement of atoms perpendicular to the plane, and $d$ is the interplanar spacing. This approximation is valid when $u_1 \\ll d$.\n\nThe algorithmic procedure to solve the problem for each test case is as follows:\n\n1.  **Input Parameters:** For each case, identify the material (Si or Ge), projectile atomic number $Z_1$, target atomic number $Z_2$, projectile kinetic energy $E$ in kiloelectronvolts (keV), screening length $a$, thermal RMS displacement $u_1$, interplanar spacing $d$, simulated critical angle $\\psi_{c,\\text{sim}}$, simulated minimum yield $\\chi_{\\text{min,sim}}$, experimental critical angle $\\psi_{c,\\text{exp}}$, and experimental minimum yield $\\chi_{\\text{min,exp}}$.\n\n2.  **Unit Conversion:** Convert the projectile energy from kiloelectronvolts to electronvolts: $E_{\\text{eV}} = E_{\\text{keV}} \\times 10^3$.\n\n3.  **Compute Analytic Estimates:**\n    a.  Select the atomic number density $n_v$ based on the material: $n_v(\\text{Si}) = 0.0500 \\, \\text{atoms}/\\text{Å}^3$ or $n_v(\\text{Ge}) = 0.0442 \\, \\text{atoms}/\\text{Å}^3$.\n    b.  Calculate the areal atomic density: $n_p = n_v \\cdot d$.\n    c.  Calculate the planar potential barrier height in electronvolts: $U_0 = 2 \\pi n_p Z_1 Z_2 k a$.\n    d.  Calculate the analytic estimate for the critical angle, $\\psi_{c,\\text{est}}$, in degrees. First, compute the value in radians using $\\psi_{c,\\text{rad}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 U_0}{E_{\\text{eV}}}}$, then convert to degrees: $\\psi_{c,\\text{est}} = \\psi_{c,\\text{rad}} \\times \\frac{180}{\\pi}$.\n    e.  Calculate the analytic estimate for the minimum yield, which is dimensionless: $\\chi_{\\text{min,est}} = \\frac{2 u_1}{d}$.\n\n4.  **Perform Validation:**\n    a.  **Critical Angle Validation:** A boolean value $b_{\\psi}$ is determined.\n        i.  Compute the relative deviation of the simulated value from the analytic estimate: $\\text{dev}_{\\text{analytic}} = \\left|\\frac{\\psi_{c,\\text{sim}} - \\psi_{c,\\text{est}}}{\\psi_{c,\\text{est}}}\\right|$.\n        ii. Compute the relative deviation of the simulated value from the experimental value: $\\text{dev}_{\\text{exp}} = \\left|\\frac{\\psi_{c,\\text{sim}} - \\psi_{c,\\text{exp}}}{\\psi_{c,\\text{exp}}}\\right|$.\n        iii. $b_{\\psi}$ is set to `True` if and only if $\\text{dev}_{\\text{analytic}} \\le 0.15$ AND $\\text{dev}_{\\text{exp}} \\le 0.10$.\n    b.  **Minimum Yield Validation:** A boolean value $b_{\\chi}$ is determined.\n        i.  Compute the absolute deviation of the simulated value from the analytic estimate: $\\text{dev}_{\\text{analytic}} = |\\chi_{\\text{min,sim}} - \\chi_{\\text{min,est}}|$.\n        ii. Compute the absolute deviation of the simulated value from the experimental value: $\\text{dev}_{\\text{exp}} = |\\chi_{\\text{min,sim}} - \\chi_{\\text{min,exp}}|$.\n        iii. $b_{\\chi}$ is set to `True` if and only if $\\text{dev}_{\\text{analytic}} \\le 0.02$ AND $\\text{dev}_{\\text{exp}} \\le 0.02$.\n\n5.  **Output:** The two booleans, $b_{\\psi}$ and $b_{\\chi}$, are recorded for each test case. The final output is a single flat list of these booleans for all cases in sequential order.",
