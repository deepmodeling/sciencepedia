This exercise uses the elegant tight-binding model to build this conceptual bridge, showing how electron 'hopping' between neighboring atoms in a periodic lattice gives rise to the energy-wavevector dispersion relation, $E(k)$ . By solving this canonical model, you will directly derive the band's total energy width and extract the effective mass, a crucial parameter that governs how carriers respond to external forces.",

The position of the $n$-th site is $R_n = na$. According to Bloch's theorem, the k-space operators $\\hat{c}_{k}$ and $\\hat{c}_{k}^{\\dagger}$ are related to the real-space operators via a discrete Fourier transform:\n$$\n\\hat{c}_{n} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{k} e^{ik(na)} \\hat{c}_{k}\n$$\n$$\n\\hat{c}_{n}^{\\dagger} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{k} e^{-ik(na)} \\hat{c}_{k}^{\\dagger}\n$$\nThe sum is over the $N$ allowed wave vectors $k$ in the first Brillouin zone, which for a 1D lattice with periodic boundary conditions are given by $k = \\frac{2\\pi m}{Na}$ for integer $m$.\n\nWe substitute these transformations into the Hamiltonian. Let's analyze the first term, $\\sum_{n} \\hat{c}_{n+1}^{\\dagger}\\hat{c}_{n}$:\n$$\n\\sum_{n} \\hat{c}_{n+1}^{\\dagger}\\hat{c}_{n} = \\sum_{n} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{k'} e^{-ik'(n+1)a} \\hat{c}_{k'}^{\\dagger} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{k} e^{ikna} \\hat{c}_{k} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k, k'} \\hat{c}_{k'}^{\\dagger} \\hat{c}_{k} e^{-ik'a} \\sum_{n=1}^{N} e^{i(k-k')na}\n$$\nThe sum over $n$ is a key identity: $\\sum_{n=1}^{N} e^{i(k-k')na} = N \\delta_{k,k'}$, where $\\delta_{k,k'}$ is the Kronecker delta.

Consequently, their sum, $G(\\mu)$, is a strictly monotonically increasing function of $\\mu$. This property guarantees that a unique root exists, ensuring the problem is well-posed.\n\nBefore solving, we must compute the values of the physical constants at $T = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n- The thermal energy is $k_B T$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. In electronvolts, $k_B \\approx 8.6173 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV/K}$, so $k_B T \\approx 0.025852\\,\\mathrm{eV}$.\n- The effective densities of states for the conduction band ($N_c$) and valence band ($N_v$) are calculated using the provided effective masses ($m_n^\\ast = 1.08\\, m_0$, $m_p^\\ast = 0.81\\, m_0$) and fundamental constants ($h, m_0, k_B$):\n$$\nN_{c,v} = 2 \\left(\\frac{2 \\pi m_{n,p}^\\ast k_B T}{h^2}\\right)^{3/2}\n$$\nUsing SI units for the calculation ($m_0 = 9.109 \\times 10^{-31}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$, $h = 6.626 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J \\cdot s}$, $k_B = 1.381 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J/K}$):\n$N_c \\approx 2.82 \\times 10^{25}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3} = 2.82 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.\n$N_v \\approx 1.83 \\times 10^{25}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3} = 1.83 \\times 10^{19}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$.\n\nThe complete Fermi-Dirac integral of order one-half,\n$$\nF_{1/2}(\\eta) = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\sqrt{x}}{1 + \\exp(x - \\eta)}\\, dx\n$$\ndoes not have a simple closed-form solution and must be evaluated numerically. We will use a standard numerical quadrature method to compute its value.\n\nThe overall numerical procedure is as follows: For each compensation ratio $r \\in \\{0.0, 0.1, 0.5, 0.9, 1.0, 1.5\\}$, we set $N_A = r \\cdot N_D$. Then we define the function $G(\\mu)$ using the specified parameters ($E_c = 1.12\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, $E_v = 0\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, $E_D = 1.075\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, $E_A = 0.057\\,\\mathrm{eV}$, $g_D = 2$, $g_A = 4$). We then employ a robust numerical root-finding algorithm, such as Brent's method, to find the unique value of $\\mu$ that satisfies $G(\\mu) = 0$. A suitable search interval for $\\mu$ would be, for example, slightly outside the bandgap, such as $[-1\\,\\mathrm{eV}, 2\\,\\mathrm{eV}]$, to ensure the root is bracketed.\n\nOnce the chemical potential $\\mu$ is determined for a given case, the two metrics of interest are calculated:\n1.  The effective activation fraction:\n    $$\n    \\alpha = \\frac{n(\\mu)}{N_D} = \\frac{N_c}{N_D} F_{1/2}\\!\\left(\\frac{\\mu - E_c}{k_B T}\\right)\n    $$\n2.  The deviation from the conduction band edge:\n    $$\n    \\Delta = E_c - \\mu\n    $$\nThis process is repeated for all six specified compensation ratios to generate the complete set of required results. The following Python program implements this procedure.",
