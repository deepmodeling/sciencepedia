We start by combining the given equations to find the functional dependence of the reaction rate $r$ on the bulk concentration $C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b}$.\n\nThe given equations are:\n1.  $r = k_r(T_s)\\,C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},s}$\n2.  $k_r(T_s) = k_0 \\exp\\!\\left(-\\dfrac{E_a}{R\\,T_s}\\right)$\n3.  $h\\,(T_s - T_b) = -\\Delta H\\,r$\n4.  $C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},s} \\approx C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b}$\n\nFirst, apply the fast mass transfer assumption (4) to the rate equation (1):\n$$r = k_r(T_s)\\,C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b}$$\nSubstitute the Arrhenius expression (2) into this equation:\n$$r = k_0 C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\dfrac{E_a}{R\\,T_s}\\right)$$\nFrom the energy balance (3), we can express the surface temperature $T_s$ as a function of the rate $r$:\n$$T_s = T_b + \\frac{-\\Delta H}{h} r$$\nSubstituting this expression for $T_s$ into the rate equation yields an implicit equation for $r$:\n$$r = k_0 C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b} \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{R \\left(T_b + \\frac{-\\Delta H}{h} r\\right)}\\right)$$\nThis equation defines the functional dependence of $r$ on $C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b}$. To find the apparent order $n$, we use implicit differentiation. First, take the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$\\ln r = \\ln(k_0 C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b}) - \\frac{E_a}{R \\left(T_b + \\frac{-\\Delta H}{h} r\\right)} = \\ln k_0 + \\ln C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b} - \\frac{E_a}{R T_s}$$\nNow, we differentiate the entire equation with respect to $\\ln C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b}$:\n$$\\frac{d(\\ln r)}{d(\\ln C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b})} = \\frac{d(\\ln k_0)}{d(\\ln C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b})} + \\frac{d(\\ln C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b})}{d(\\ln C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b})} - \\frac{d}{d(\\ln C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b})}\\left(\\frac{E_a}{R T_s}\\right)$$\nBy definition, $n \\equiv \\frac{d(\\ln r)}{d(\\ln C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b})}$. The other terms evaluate as:\n$$n = 0 + 1 - \\frac{E_a}{R} \\frac{d(T_s^{-1})}{d(\\ln C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b})} = 1 - \\frac{E_a}{R} (-1)T_s^{-2} \\frac{dT_s}{d(\\ln C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b})}$$\n$$n = 1 + \\frac{E_a}{RT_s^2} \\frac{dT_s}{d(\\ln C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b})}$$\nTo find $\\frac{dT_s}{d(\\ln C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b})}$, we differentiate the energy balance $T_s = T_b + \\frac{-\\Delta H}{h} r$:\n$$\\frac{dT_s}{d(\\ln C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b})} = \\frac{d T_b}{d(\\ln C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b})} + \\frac{-\\Delta H}{h} \\frac{dr}{d(\\ln C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b})}$$\nSince $T_b$ is a constant parameter, its derivative is zero. And by the chain rule, $\\frac{dr}{d(\\ln C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b})} = \\frac{d(\\exp(\\ln r))}{d(\\ln C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b})} = \\exp(\\ln r) \\frac{d(\\ln r)}{d(\\ln C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b})} = r n$.\n$$\\frac{dT_s}{d(\\ln C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b})} = \\frac{-\\Delta H}{h} (r n)$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $n$:\n$$n = 1 + \\frac{E_a}{RT_s^2} \\left( \\frac{-\\Delta H}{h} r n \\right)$$\nNow we solve for $n$:\n$$n - n \\left( \\frac{E_a (-\\Delta H) r}{R h T_s^2} \\right) = 1$$\n$$n \\left( 1 - \\frac{E_a (-\\Delta H) r}{R h T_s^2} \\right) = 1$$\n$$n = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{E_a (-\\Delta H) r}{R h T_s^2}}$$\nThis expression for $n$ is exact. We now apply the approximation for the \"small heating regime\". In this regime, the temperature rise is small, so $T_s \\approx T_b$. The rate $r$ can be approximated by the isothermal rate evaluated at $T_b$, which we denote $r_0$:\n$$r \\approx r_0 = k_r(T_b) C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b} = k_b C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b}, \\quad \\text{where} \\quad k_b \\equiv k_0 \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{RT_b}\\right)$$\nSubstituting $T_s \\approx T_b$ and $r \\approx k_b C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b}$ into the denominator of the expression for $n$:\n$$n \\approx \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{E_a (-\\Delta H) (k_b C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b})}{R h T_b^2}}$$\nLet's define the dimensionless group $\\alpha$ as given in the options:\n$$\\alpha \\equiv \\frac{E_a}{R} \\frac{(-\\Delta H)}{h T_b^2}$$\nWith this definition, the expression for $n$ becomes:\n$$n \\approx \\frac{1}{1 - \\alpha k_b C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b}}$$\nTo compare with the form in the options, we can rewrite this as:\n$$n = \\frac{(1 - \\alpha k_b C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b}) + \\alpha k_b C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b}}{1 - \\alpha k_b C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b}} = 1 + \\frac{\\alpha k_b C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b}}{1 - \\alpha k_b C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b}}$$\nThis is precisely the expression given in options A and E.\n\n## Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The elementary step molecularity is $1$, but the local apparent reaction order is concentration-dependent due to heat transfer coupling. In the small-heating regime, $$n = 1 + \\frac{\\alpha\\,k_b\\,C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b}}{1 - \\alpha\\,k_b\\,C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b}},\\quad \\text{with}\\quad k_b \\equiv k_0 \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{E_a}{R\\,T_b}\\right),\\ \\alpha \\equiv \\frac{E_a}{R}\\,\\frac{(-\\Delta H)}{h\\,T_b^{2}},$$ so that for exothermic decomposition ($-\\Delta H  0$) one has $n  1$ and $n$ increases with $C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b}$.**\n\nThe first part correctly distinguishes molecularity ($1$, from the problem statement) from the apparent reaction order, which our derivation shows is a complex function, not a simple constant. The derived expression for $n$ matches the one provided. We now analyze the consequences for an exothermic reaction.\nGiven $-\\Delta H  0$. The activation energy $E_a$ is positive, as are $R$, $h$, and $T_b$. Therefore, the parameter $\\alpha$ is positive ($\\alpha  0$).\nThe term $\\alpha k_b C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b}$ is positive. In the \"small heating\" regime, this term must be less than $1$ to avoid thermal runaway (where the denominator would go to zero or negative).\nSo, $0  \\alpha k_b C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b}  1$.\nThe denominator $1 - \\alpha k_b C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b}$ is a positive number less than $1$.\nThis makes $n = \\frac{1}{\\text{number}1}$, which means $n  1$.\nAs $C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b}$ increases, the denominator decreases, causing $n$ to increase.\nPhysically, a higher concentration leads to a higher rate, which for an exothermic reaction leads to a higher surface temperature, which in turn exponentially increases the rate constant. This positive feedback makes the overall rate more sensitive to concentration than the intrinsic first-order kinetics would suggest, hence $n  1$. The option's analysis is entirely correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. For any elementary unimolecular step, molecularity and reaction order are identical, hence $n = 1$ regardless of transport.**\n\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. The identity of molecularity and reaction order holds only for elementary reactions under ideal, isothermal, and homogeneous conditions. This problem explicitly introduces non-isothermal conditions due to heat transfer effects, which couple the rate to the temperature, which in turn depends on the rate itself. Our derivation demonstrates that this coupling causes the apparent order $n$ to deviate from the molecularity of $1$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Heat transfer limitations in an exothermic case diminish the apparent reaction order below $1$ as $C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b}$ increases (i.e., $n  1$ and $n \\to 0$ at large $C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b}$).**\n\nThis statement incorrectly describes the effect of heat transfer for an exothermic reaction. As shown in the analysis for option A, the positive feedback from an exothermic reaction *increases* the apparent reaction order, making $n  1$. The behavior described ($n  1$) is characteristic of either significant mass transfer limitations (which are assumed negligible here) or heat transfer effects in an *endothermic* reaction (see option E).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. When transport is limiting, the observed rate $r$ is independent of $C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b}$ (zero-order), so there is no distinction between molecularity and reaction order.**\n\nThis statement is flawed in multiple ways. First, a transport-limited rate is not generally zero-order. For example, if mass transfer across a boundary layer is the limiting step, the rate is often approximated by $r \\approx k_m (C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b} - C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},s})$, which can lead to an apparent order of $1$ if $C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},s} \\approx 0$. A zero-order reaction is a specific case of rate saturation, not a general outcome of transport limitation. Second, the conclusion \"so there is no distinction between molecularity and reaction order\" is illogical. If the apparent order becomes $0$ while the molecularity is $1$, this is a clear demonstration *of* the distinction, not its absence.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. If the decomposition were endothermic (so that $-\\Delta H  0$), the same analysis would yield $$n = 1 + \\frac{\\alpha\\,k_b\\,C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b}}{1 - \\alpha\\,k_b\\,C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b}}$$ with $\\alpha  0$, implying $n  1$ that decreases with $C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b}$.**\n\nThe derivation for $n$ is general and does not depend on the sign of $-\\Delta H$. If the reaction is endothermic, $-\\Delta H  0$. Since all other quantities in the definition of $\\alpha$ are positive, this correctly implies $\\alpha  0$.\nThe expression for $n$ is $n = \\frac{1}{1 - \\alpha k_b C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b}}$. With $\\alpha  0$, the term $-\\alpha k_b C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b}$ is positive. Therefore, the denominator $1 - \\alpha k_b C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b}$ is greater than $1$. This immediately implies that $n = \\frac{1}{\\text{number}1}$, so $0  n  1$. The claim $n  1$ is correct.\nFurthermore, as $C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b}$ increases, the positive term $-\\alpha k_b C_{\\mathrm{SiH_4},b}$ increases, making the denominator larger. This causes $n$ to decrease.\nPhysically, a higher concentration leads to a higher rate, which for an endothermic reaction cools the surface, thus slowing the rate constant. This negative feedback dampens the rate's sensitivity to concentration changes, resulting in an apparent order $n  1$. The analysis in this option is entirely correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**",
