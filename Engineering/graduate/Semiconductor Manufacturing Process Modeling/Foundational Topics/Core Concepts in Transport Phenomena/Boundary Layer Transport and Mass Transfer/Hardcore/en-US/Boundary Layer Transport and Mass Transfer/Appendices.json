            "problem": "A planar silicon wafer is undergoing low-pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) of a binary hydride precursor in a horizontal reactor. The precursor is dilute in a carrier gas and is the rate-limiting species for deposition. Consider a steady laminar flow over the wafer such that the normal (wall-normal) convective velocity is negligible across a thin concentration boundary layer adjacent to the surface. The gas phase has no homogeneous reaction and exhibits constant properties. Model the boundary layer as a stagnant film of thickness $\\delta$ in which diffusion of the precursor with constant binary diffusivity $D$ delivers species from the bulk to the surface. At the surface, the precursor is consumed by a first-order heterogeneous reaction with an intrinsic rate constant $k_{s}$, so that the molar surface reaction rate density equals $k_{s} c_{s}$, where $c_{s}$ is the precursor molar concentration at the surface. Far from the surface, the precursor molar concentration is uniform and equal to $c_{\\infty}$.\n\nStarting from steady-state species conservation in the film and Fick’s first law, with appropriate boundary conditions at the wall and at the edge of the film, derive a closed-form expression for the steady molar deposition flux $J$ to the wafer surface and rewrite it in a form that can be interpreted as a sum of an interfacial kinetic resistance and an external mass-transfer resistance.

            "solution": "The problem is validated as scientifically sound, well-posed, and self-contained. The physical model proposed—a stagnant film with first-order surface kinetics—is a standard and appropriate simplification for analyzing mass transfer in a CVD process. All necessary data are provided, and the parameters have physically reasonable values.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the steady molar deposition flux, $J$, onto a wafer surface. We model the system as one-dimensional transport across a stagnant film of thickness $\\delta$. Let the coordinate $y$ be normal to the wafer surface, with $y=0$ at the surface and $y=\\delta$ at the edge of the film.\n\nThe steady-state species conservation for the precursor in the film, with no homogeneous reactions, is given by:\n$$\n\\frac{dJ_y}{dy} = 0\n$$\nwhere $J_y$ is the molar flux of the precursor in the $y$-direction. This implies that $J_y$ is constant throughout the film. According to Fick's first law for a dilute species, the flux is related to the concentration gradient:\n$$\nJ_y = -D \\frac{dc}{dy}\n$$\nwhere $D$ is the constant binary diffusivity and $c(y)$ is the molar concentration of the precursor. Combining these two equations, since $D$ is constant, we obtain the governing second-order ordinary differential equation for the concentration profile:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2c}{dy^2} = 0\n$$\nThe general solution to this equation is a linear concentration profile:\n$$\nc(y) = C_1 y + C_2\n$$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constants of integration to be determined from the boundary conditions.\n\nThe boundary conditions are as follows:\n1.  At the edge of the stagnant film ($y=\\delta$), the precursor concentration is equal to the bulk gas concentration, $c_{\\infty}$.\n    $$\n    c(\\delta) = c_{\\infty}\n    $$\n2.  At the wafer surface ($y=0$), the diffusive flux of the precursor towards the surface must equal the rate at which it is consumed by the first-order surface reaction. The deposition flux, $J$, is defined as this rate. The rate of arrival by diffusion (flux in the $-y$ direction) is $-J_y = D \\frac{dc}{dy}$. The rate of consumption is $k_s c_s$, where $c_s = c(0)$.\n    $$\n    J = \\left. D \\frac{dc}{dy} \\right|_{y=0} = k_s c(0)\n    $$\n\nApplying the general solution $c(y) = C_1 y + C_2$ to the boundary conditions:\nFrom the form of the solution, we have $\\frac{dc}{dy} = C_1$ and $c(0) = C_2$.\nApplying the first boundary condition, $c(\\delta) = c_{\\infty}$:\n$$\nC_1 \\delta + C_2 = c_{\\infty} \\quad (1)\n$$\nApplying the second boundary condition, $\\left. D \\frac{dc}{dy} \\right|_{y=0} = k_s c(0)$:\n$$\nD C_1 = k_s C_2 \\quad (2)\n$$\n\nWe now solve this system of two linear equations for $C_1$ and $C_2$. From equation (2), we can express $C_2$ in terms of $C_1$:\n$$\nC_2 = \\frac{D}{k_s} C_1\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $C_2$ into equation (1):\n$$\nC_1 \\delta + \\left(\\frac{D}{k_s}\\right) C_1 = c_{\\infty}\n$$\nFactoring out $C_1$:\n$$\nC_1 \\left(\\delta + \\frac{D}{k_s}\\right) = c_{\\infty}\n$$\nSolving for $C_1$:\n$$\nC_1 = \\frac{c_{\\infty}}{\\delta + \\frac{D}{k_s}}\n$$\nThe steady molar deposition flux $J$ is given by $J = D C_1$. Substituting the expression for $C_1$:\n$$\nJ = D \\left( \\frac{c_{\\infty}}{\\delta + \\frac{D}{k_s}} \\right) = \\frac{D c_{\\infty}}{\\delta + \\frac{D}{k_s}}\n$$\nTo rewrite this in the form of a sum of resistances, we can rearrange the expression as:\n$$\nJ = \\frac{c_{\\infty}}{\\frac{\\delta}{D} + \\frac{1}{k_s}}\n$$\nThis expression is analogous to Ohm's law ($I = V/R$), where the flux $J$ is the \"current,\" the bulk concentration $c_{\\infty}$ serves as the driving potential, and the denominator is the total resistance to mass transfer, $R_{total}$. The total resistance is the sum of two series resistances:\n1.  An external mass-transfer resistance, $R_{mt} = \\frac{\\delta}{D}$, which characterizes the opposition to diffusion through the stagnant film.\n2.  An interfacial kinetic resistance, $R_{kin} = \\frac{1}{k_s}$, which characterizes the opposition to the chemical reaction at the surface.\n\nThus, the expression is $J = \\frac{c_{\\infty}}{R_{mt} + R_{kin}}$.\nThis summed-resistances model, derived from the stagnant film approximation, has notable limitations compared to a full convective boundary-layer solution. The stagnant film model assumes a fictitious, motionless layer of a fixed thickness $\\delta$. In reality, the fluid velocity is non-zero within the boundary layer and varies with position. A full solution of the coupled fluid dynamics (Navier-Stokes equations) and mass transport (convective-diffusion equation) would show that the boundary layer thickness grows with distance from the wafer's leading edge. Consequently, the actual deposition flux $J$ is not uniform across the wafer surface, being highest at the leading edge and decreasing downstream. The stagnant film model, using a single effective $\\delta$, provides only a spatially-averaged or localized estimate of the flux and cannot capture these two-dimensional effects.\n\nNext, we compute the numerical value of the flux $J$ using the given parameters:\n-   $c_{\\infty} = 2.40 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$\n-   $D = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n-   $\\delta = 5.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{m}$\n-   $k_{s} = 0.20 \\ \\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the individual resistances:\nThe mass-transfer resistance is:\n$$\nR_{mt} = \\frac{\\delta}{D} = \\frac{5.0 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{m}}{5.0 \\times 10^{-5} \\ \\mathrm{m}^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 10.0 \\ \\mathrm{s}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\n$$\nThe kinetic resistance is:\n$$\nR_{kin} = \\frac{1}{k_s} = \\frac{1}{0.20 \\ \\mathrm{m}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = 5.0 \\ \\mathrm{s}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\n$$\nThe total resistance is the sum of these two values:\n$$\nR_{total} = R_{mt} + R_{kin} = 10.0 \\ \\mathrm{s}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1} + 5.0 \\ \\mathrm{s}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1} = 15.0 \\ \\mathrm{s}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}\n$$\nNow, we calculate the deposition flux $J$:\n$$\nJ = \\frac{c_{\\infty}}{R_{total}} = \\frac{2.40 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}}{15.0 \\ \\mathrm{s}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-1}} = 0.00016 \\ \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThis can be written in scientific notation as $1.6 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nJ = 1.600 \\times 10^{-4} \\ \\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$",

            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of intrinsic surface reaction rate constants, $k_s$, at two different temperatures, and the corresponding activation energy, $E_a$, for a first-order reaction in a Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) process. The methodology relies on decoupling the effects of mass transport and surface reaction kinetics by analyzing deposition rates under varying fluid dynamic conditions.\n\nThe overall deposition process involves two steps occurring in series:\n1.  Mass transport of the precursor species, A, from the bulk gas to the wafer surface.\n2.  The chemical reaction of A on the wafer surface.\n\nThe molar flux, $N_A$, which is equal to the measured deposition rate, $R_{\\text{dep}}$, can be described by two fundamental rate laws.\n\nThe mass transport flux from the bulk to the surface is given by Fick's first law in terms of a mass transfer coefficient, $k_m$:\n$$R_{\\text{dep}} = N_A = k_m (C_{A,b} - C_{A,s})$$\nwhere $C_{A,b}$ is the molar concentration of the precursor in the bulk gas stream, and $C_{A,s}$ is the molar concentration at the surface.\n\nThe surface reaction is stated to be first-order in the precursor concentration:\n$$R_{\\text{dep}} = k_s C_{A,s}$$\nwhere $k_s$ is the intrinsic surface reaction rate constant.\n\nAt steady state, the flux of reactants to the surface is equal to the rate of consumption by the reaction.

The gas contains a dilute reactive species of diffusivity $D$ in the carrier gas of kinematic viscosity $\\nu$. The species concentration in the free stream is $C_{\\infty}$, and the wafer surface is maintained at a uniform concentration $C_{s}$ due to rapid surface reaction kinetics. Assume the following:\n- The mass fraction of the dilute species is sufficiently small that density variations are negligible and the flow field is unaffected by mass transfer (no blowing or suction).\n- Properties $D$ and $\\nu$ are constant, and thermal effects can be neglected.\n- The boundary layer remains laminar over the entire wafer and is thin compared to the wafer radius so that local transport near any streamwise station is well-approximated by the two-dimensional laminar flat-plate boundary layer from a sharp leading edge.\n- The local mass transfer coefficient depends only on the streamwise distance $x$ from the upstream rim (leading edge) and is uniform across the local chord at that $x$.\n- The concentration difference $C_{\\infty}-C_{s}$ is constant and finite.\n\nStarting from the steady, two-dimensional convection–diffusion boundary-layer equation for the dilute species and the definition of the local Sherwood number (dimensionless mass transfer coefficient), and using well-tested similarity results for laminar flat-plate boundary layers, derive a closed-form analytic expression for the area-averaged mass transfer coefficient $k_{m,\\mathrm{avg}}$ over the wafer surface.
