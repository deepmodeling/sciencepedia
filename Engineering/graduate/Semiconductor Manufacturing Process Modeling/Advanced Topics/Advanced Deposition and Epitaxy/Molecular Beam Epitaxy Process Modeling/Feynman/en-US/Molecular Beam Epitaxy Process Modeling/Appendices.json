The provided values are realistic for MBE applications. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. Therefore, a problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n### Derivation of the Flux Density Expression\nThe net number flux density, $J_{\\text{net}}$, emitted from the orifice is the difference between the flux of particles exiting the cell, $J_{\\text{out}}$, and the flux of particles entering the cell from the ambient vacuum, $J_{\\text{in}}$.\n$$J_{\\text{net}} = J_{\\text{out}} - J_{\\text{in}}$$\nWe begin by deriving a general expression for the flux density of particles, $J$, from an ideal gas at pressure $P$ and temperature $T$ impinging on a surface. This flux density represents the number of particles crossing a unit area per unit time.\n\nAccording to the kinetic theory of gases, the number density of particles, $n$, is related to the pressure $P$ and temperature $T$ by the ideal gas law:\n$$P = n k_B T \\implies n = \\frac{P}{k_B T}$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nThe velocities of the particles in the gas are described by the Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution. For a gas in thermal equilibrium, the probability distribution function for the velocity vector $\\mathbf{v} = (v_x, v_y, v_z)$ is given by:\n$$f(\\mathbf{v}) = \\left(\\frac{m}{2\\pi k_B T}\\right)^{3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m(v_x^2+v_y^2+v_z^2)}{2k_B T}\\right)$$\nThe number of particles per unit volume with velocities in the infinitesimal range $d^3\\mathbf{v} = dv_x dv_y dv_z$ around $\\mathbf{v}$ is $n f(\\mathbf{v})d^3\\mathbf{v}$.\n\nConsider the orifice to lie in the $xy$-plane. The number of particles with velocity $\\mathbf{v}$ that cross an infinitesimal area $dA$ in this plane in a time $dt$ is the number of particles contained in a skewed cylinder with base $dA$ and height $v_z dt$. This number is $(v_z dt dA) \\times (n f(\\mathbf{v}) d^3\\mathbf{v})$. We are interested in the flux, which is the number of particles per unit area per unit time. We must integrate over all possible velocities for particles moving towards the orifice, i.e., those with $v_z > 0$.\n\nThe flux density $J$ is thus given by the integral:\n$$J = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dv_x \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dv_y \\int_{0}^{\\infty} dv_z \\, v_z \\, n \\, f(\\mathbf{v})$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $n$ and $f(\\mathbf{v})$:\n$$J = n \\left(\\frac{m}{2\\pi k_B T}\\right)^{3/2} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dv_x \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} dv_y \\int_{0}^{\\infty} dv_z \\, v_z \\exp\\left(-\\frac{m(v_x^2+v_y^2+v_z^2)}{2k_B T}\\right)$$\nThe integral can be separated into three parts:\n$$J = n \\left(\\frac{m}{2\\pi k_B T}\\right)^{3/2} \\left[\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv_x^2}{2k_B T}\\right) dv_x\\right] \\left[\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv_y^2}{2k_B T}\\right) dv_y\\right] \\left[\\int_{0}^{\\infty} v_z \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv_z^2}{2k_B T}\\right) dv_z\\right]$$\nThe first two integrals are standard Gaussian integrals of the form $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp(-ax^2)dx = \\sqrt{\\pi/a}$. With $a = \\frac{m}{2k_B T}$, each of these integrals evaluates to $\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi k_B T}{m}}$.\n\nThe third integral is evaluated using a substitution. Let $u = \\frac{mv_z^2}{2k_B T}$, which implies $du = \\frac{mv_z}{k_B T} dv_z$, or $v_z dv_z = \\frac{k_B T}{m} du$. The limits of integration for $u$ are from $0$ to $\\infty$.\n$$\\int_{0}^{\\infty} v_z \\exp\\left(-\\frac{mv_z^2}{2k_B T}\\right) dv_z = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\frac{k_B T}{m} \\exp(-u) du = \\frac{k_B T}{m} [-\\exp(-u)]_{0}^{\\infty} = \\frac{k_B T}{m} (0 - (-1)) = \\frac{k_B T}{m}$$\nSubstituting the results of the three integrals back into the expression for $J$:\n$$J = n \\left(\\frac{m}{2\\pi k_B T}\\right)^{3/2} \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi k_B T}{m}}\\right)^2 \\left(\\frac{k_B T}{m}\\right)$$\n$$J = n \\left(\\frac{m}{2\\pi k_B T}\\right)^{3/2} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi k_B T}{m}\\right) \\left(\\frac{k_B T}{m}\\right) = n \\left(\\frac{m}{2\\pi k_B T}\\right)^{1/2} \\left(\\frac{k_B T}{m}\\right) = n \\sqrt{\\frac{k_B T}{2\\pi m}}$$\nNow, substitute $n = P/(k_B T)$:\n$$J = \\frac{P}{k_B T} \\sqrt{\\frac{k_B T}{2\\pi m}} = \\frac{P}{\\sqrt{2\\pi m k_B T}}$$\nThis is the Hertz-Knudsen equation for the flux of particles impinging on a surface.\n\nThe flux exiting the cell, $J_{\\text{out}}$, is determined by the equilibrium conditions inside. The evaporation coefficient $\\alpha=1$ signifies that the rate of evaporation from the surface is equal to the flux that would be required to maintain the equilibrium vapor pressure $p_{\\text{eq}}$. Thus, $J_{\\text{out}}$ corresponds to the flux from a gas at pressure $p_{\\text{eq}}$ and temperature $T$.\n$$J_{\\text{out}} = \\frac{p_{\\text{eq}}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi m k_B T}}$$\nThe flux entering the cell, $J_{\\text{in}}$, is determined by the ambient conditions outside, where the pressure is $p$ and the temperature is assumed to be $T$.\n$$J_{\\text{in}} = \\frac{p}{\\sqrt{2\\pi m k_B T}}$$\nThe net emitted flux density is therefore:\n$$J_{\\text{net}} = J_{\\text{out}} - J_{\\text{in}} = \\frac{p_{\\text{eq}} - p}{\\sqrt{2\\pi m k_B T}}$$\nThis is the required expression.\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nThe problem states that the ambient pressure is negligible, $p \\approx 0$. The net flux expression simplifies to:\n$$J_{\\text{net}} = \\frac{p_{\\text{eq}}}{\\sqrt{2\\pi m k_B T}}$$\nWe now substitute the given values in SI units.\n- Pressure $p_{\\text{eq}}$:\n$$p_{\\text{eq}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-2}\\ \\text{Torr} \\times \\frac{133.322\\ \\text{Pa}}{1\\ \\text{Torr}} = 1.33322\\ \\text{Pa}$$\n- Mass $m$:\n$$m = 69.7\\ \\text{amu} \\times \\frac{1.66053906660 \\times 10^{-27}\\ \\text{kg}}{1\\ \\text{amu}} = 1.1573962 \\times 10^{-25}\\ \\text{kg}$$\n- Temperature $T$:\n$$T = 1100\\ \\text{K}$$\n- Boltzmann constant $k_B$:\n$$k_B \\approx 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\text{J K}^{-1}$$\n\nFirst, we compute the denominator $\\sqrt{2\\pi m k_B T}$:\n$$2\\pi m k_B T = 2\\pi \\times (1.1573962 \\times 10^{-25}\\ \\text{kg}) \\times (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\text{J K}^{-1}) \\times (1100\\ \\text{K})$$\n$$2\\pi m k_B T \\approx (6.283185) \\times (1.1573962 \\times 10^{-25}) \\times (1.5187139 \\times 10^{-20})\\ \\text{kg J}$$\n$$2\\pi m k_B T \\approx 1.104426 \\times 10^{-44}\\ \\text{kg}^2 \\text{m}^2 \\text{s}^{-2}$$\nTaking the square root:\n$$\\sqrt{2\\pi m k_B T} \\approx \\sqrt{1.104426 \\times 10^{-44}\\ \\text{kg}^2 \\text{m}^2 \\text{s}^{-2}} \\approx 1.050917 \\times 10^{-22}\\ \\text{kg m s}^{-1}$$\nFinally, we calculate the net flux density $J_{\\text{net}}$:\n$$J_{\\text{net}} = \\frac{1.33322\\ \\text{Pa}}{1.050917 \\times 10^{-22}\\ \\text{kg m s}^{-1}} = \\frac{1.33322\\ \\text{N m}^{-2}}{1.050917 \\times 10^{-22}\\ \\text{kg m s}^{-1}}$$\n$$J_{\\text{net}} \\approx 1.268633 \\times 10^{22}\\ \\text{m}^{-2} \\text{s}^{-1}$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, we get:\n$$J_{\\text{net}} \\approx 1.269 \\times 10^{22}\\ \\text{atoms}\\ \\text{m}^{-2}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$$",
