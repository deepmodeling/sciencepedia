            "solution": "The problem requires the determination of the gallium sticking coefficient during the Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) growth of gallium arsenide (GaAs). This will be accomplished by following the prescribed steps: first, determining the areal atomic density of a gallium monolayer from the crystal structure; second, calculating the experimental growth rate from the Reflection High-Energy Electron Diffraction (RHEED) oscillation data; and third, comparing the flux of atoms incorporated into the growing film with the incident gallium flux.\n\nThe fundamental principle is that under gallium-limited growth conditions, the growth rate is controlled by the arrival and incorporation of gallium atoms. The RHEED oscillation period, $T$, provides a direct measure of the time required to complete one monolayer. The sticking coefficient, $s$, is defined as the ratio of the incorporated atomic flux to the incident atomic flux.\n\n1. Determination of the areal atomic density of a gallium $(001)$ monolayer.\nGallium arsenide crystallizes in the zincblende structure, which consists of two interpenetrating face-centered cubic (FCC) sublattices, one for gallium (Ga) and one for arsenic (As), displaced from each other. The problem states that the crystal packing of the FCC cation sublattice determines the monolayer areal atomic density. We therefore consider the arrangement of atoms on a $(001)$ plane of a standard FCC unit cell with lattice parameter $a$.\n\nA two-dimensional unit cell on the $(001)$ surface has an area of $A = a^2$. The atoms in an FCC lattice are located at the corners and face centers of the conventional cubic cell. For a plane at a constant $z$ coordinate, such as the $z=0$ plane, atoms are located at the four corners of the square face and at the center of that face.\nThe number of atoms, $N$, associated with this surface unit cell area is calculated by considering the sharing of atoms with adjacent cells:\n- There is one atom at the face center, which is entirely contained within the unit cell area.\n- There are four atoms at the corners, each of which is shared by four adjacent surface unit cells.\nThus, the total number of atoms per $(001)$ surface unit cell is $N = 1_{\\text{center}} + 4 \\times \\frac{1}{4}_{\\text{corner}} = 2$ atoms.\n\nThe areal atomic density of a single gallium $(001)$ monolayer, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{Ga}}$, is therefore:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{Ga}} = \\frac{N}{A} = \\frac{2}{a^2}\n$$\nThe lattice parameter is given as $a = 5.653\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$. To be consistent with the units of flux ($\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$), we convert $a$ to centimeters: $a = 5.653 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{Ga}} = \\frac{2}{(5.653 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{cm})^2} \\approx \\frac{2}{3.1956 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2} \\approx 6.2586 \\times 10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{atoms}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\n$$\n\n2. Computation of the observed growth rate.\nThe problem states that one RHEED oscillation corresponds to the completion of one single-species $(001)$ monolayer. The measured period is $T = 1.8\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\nThe growth rate in monolayers per second, $R_{\\mathrm{ML}}$, is the reciprocal of the oscillation period:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{ML}} = \\frac{1}{T} = \\frac{1}{1.8\\,\\mathrm{s}} \\approx 0.555... \\,\\mathrm{monolayers}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nTo find the thickness growth rate, $R_h$, we need the thickness of one monolayer. In the zincblende structure, the planes along the $[001]$ direction consist of alternating layers of Ga and As. The Ga atoms form an FCC sublattice, and the planes of this sublattice passing through the conventional unit cell are at $z=0$ and $z=a/2$. The distance between successive planes of the same species (Ga) along the $[001]$ direction is the interplanar spacing $d_{002} = a/2$. Therefore, the thickness added to the film for each completed Ga monolayer is $h_{\\mathrm{ML}} = a/2$.\n$$\nh_{\\mathrm{ML}} = \\frac{a}{2} = \\frac{5.653\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}}{2} = 2.8265\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}\n$$\nConverting to nanometers, $h_{\\mathrm{ML}} = 0.28265\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\nThe thickness growth rate $R_h$ is then:\n$$\nR_h = R_{\\mathrm{ML}} \\times h_{\\mathrm{ML}} = \\frac{1}{T} \\frac{a}{2} = \\frac{1}{1.8\\,\\mathrm{s}} \\times 0.28265\\,\\mathrm{nm} \\approx 0.157\\,\\mathrm{nm}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\n\n3. Inference of the gallium sticking coefficient.\nThe sticking coefficient, $s$, is the ratio of the incorporated flux of atoms, $J_{\\mathrm{inc}}$, to the incident flux, $F_{\\mathrm{Ga}}$.\n$$\ns = \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{inc}}}{F_{\\mathrm{Ga}}}\n$$\nThe incorporated flux is the number of atoms that become part of the crystal per unit area per unit time. From the RHEED data, we know that one monolayer, with an areal density of $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{Ga}}$, is formed in time $T$. Thus, the incorporated flux is:\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{inc}} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{Ga}}}{T}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{Ga}}$ from Part 1:\n$$\nJ_{\\mathrm{inc}} = \\frac{2}{a^2 T}\n$$\nNow we can write the expression for the sticking coefficient $s$:\n$$\ns = \\frac{J_{\\mathrm{inc}}}{F_{\\mathrm{Ga}}} = \\frac{2}{a^2 T F_{\\mathrm{Ga}}}\n$$\nWe are given the following values:\n- Lattice parameter: $a = 5.653\\,\\mathrm{\\AA} = 5.653 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{cm}$\n- RHEED period: $T = 1.8\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n- Incident gallium flux: $F_{\\mathrm{Ga}} = 3.90 \\times 10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{atoms}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $s$:\n$$\ns = \\frac{2}{(5.653 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\mathrm{cm})^2 \\times (1.8\\,\\mathrm{s}) \\times (3.90 \\times 10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1})}\n$$\n$$\ns = \\frac{2}{(3.19564 \\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^2) \\times (7.02 \\times 10^{14}\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-2})}\n$$\n$$\ns = \\frac{2}{3.19564 \\times 7.02 \\times 10^{-1}} = \\frac{2}{2.24334...} \\approx 0.89152\n$$\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$\ns \\approx 0.892\n$$\nThis value is physically reasonable, as Ga-limited growth implies a high incorporation probability for Ga, and thus a sticking coefficient close to unity.",

            "solution": "The problem requires determining the composition $x$ of an $\\mathrm{In}_x\\mathrm{Ga}_{1-x}\\mathrm{As}$ alloy film that is lattice matched to a $\\mathrm{GaAs}$ substrate.\n\nFirst, the givens are extracted and validated.\nGivens:\n- Film material: $\\mathrm{In}_x\\mathrm{Ga}_{1-x}\\mathrm{As}$\n- Substrate material: $\\mathrm{GaAs}$\n- Condition: The film is lattice matched to the substrate.\n- Assumption: Thermal expansion effects are negligible, and room-temperature lattice parameters can be used.\n- Lattice parameter of $\\mathrm{InAs}$: $a_{\\mathrm{InAs}} = 6.058\\,\\text{\\AA}$.\n- Lattice parameter of $\\mathrm{GaAs}$: $a_{\\mathrm{GaAs}} = 5.653\\,\\text{\\AA}$.\n- Lattice parameter model for the alloy: A linear interpolation in composition $x$ with a quadratic bowing correction characterized by a bowing parameter $b_a = 0.02\\,\\text{\\AA}$.\n- Required solution constraint: $x \\in [0, 1]$.\n\nValidation:\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a standard scenario in semiconductor heteroepitaxy. The physical model for the alloy lattice parameter, a modified Vegard's law including a bowing term, is a standard and accepted model in materials science. The given lattice constants are correct, and the bowing parameter, while a simplified value, does not render the problem physically inconsistent. The problem's structure leads to a solvable equation with a unique, physically meaningful solution. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**.\n\nThe condition for a film to be lattice matched to a substrate is that their natural (bulk) lattice parameters are equal. This results in zero lattice misfit ($m=0$), where misfit is defined as $m = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{substrate}} - a_{\\mathrm{film}}}{a_{\\mathrm{film}}}$. For this problem, the condition is:\n$$a_{\\mathrm{In}_x\\mathrm{Ga}_{1-x}\\mathrm{As}} = a_{\\mathrm{GaAs}}$$\nHere, $a_{\\mathrm{In}_x\\mathrm{Ga}_{1-x}\\mathrm{As}}$ is the natural lattice parameter of the alloy film, which is a function of the indium mole fraction $x$.\n\nThe problem states that the alloy lattice parameter follows a composition interpolation that is linear in $x$ with a quadratic bowing correction. This is modeled for the ternary alloy $\\mathrm{In}_x\\mathrm{Ga}_{1-x}\\mathrm{As}$ by relating its lattice parameter, $a(x)$, to those of its binary constituents, $\\mathrm{InAs}$ and $\\mathrm{GaAs}$. The standard expression is:\n$$a(x) = (1-x) a_{\\mathrm{GaAs}} + x a_{\\mathrm{InAs}} + C x(1-x)$$\nwhere the term $C x(1-x)$ represents the quadratic bowing correction. The problem provides a bowing parameter $b_a = 0.02\\,\\text{\\AA}$. A positive bowing parameter for the lattice constant of $\\mathrm{InGaAs}$ corresponds to an upward bowing (the lattice constant is larger than the linear interpolation), which is consistent with experimental observations. We therefore associate the coefficient $C$ with the given parameter $b_a$, so $C=b_a$. The model is:\n$$a(x) = (1-x) a_{\\mathrm{GaAs}} + x a_{\\mathrm{InAs}} + b_a x(1-x)$$\n\nNow, we substitute this model into the lattice-matching condition:\n$$(1-x) a_{\\mathrm{GaAs}} + x a_{\\mathrm{InAs}} + b_a x(1-x) = a_{\\mathrm{GaAs}}$$\nThis equation must be solved for the composition $x$. We expand and rearrange the terms:\n$$a_{\\mathrm{GaAs}} - x a_{\\mathrm{GaAs}} + x a_{\\mathrm{InAs}} + b_a x - b_a x^2 = a_{\\mathrm{GaAs}}$$\nSubtracting $a_{\\mathrm{GaAs}}$ from both sides yields:\n$$-x a_{\\mathrm{GaAs}} + x a_{\\mathrm{InAs}} + b_a x - b_a x^2 = 0$$\nWe can factor out a common term of $x$:\n$$x [ (a_{\\mathrm{InAs}} - a_{\\mathrm{GaAs}} + b_a) - b_a x ] = 0$$\nThis equation provides two possible mathematical solutions for $x$:\n1.  $x=0$\n2.  $(a_{\\mathrm{InAs}} - a_{\\mathrm{GaAs}} + b_a) - b_a x = 0$\n\nThe first solution, $x=0$, corresponds to a film of pure $\\mathrm{GaAs}$ ($\\mathrm{In}_0\\mathrm{Ga}_{1}\\mathrm{As}$). A film of $\\mathrm{GaAs}$ is trivially lattice matched to a $\\mathrm{GaAs}$ substrate. Since $x=0$ is within the physically admissible range $x \\in [0,1]$, this is a valid solution.\n\nThe second solution is found by solving the linear equation for $x$:\n$$b_a x = a_{\\mathrm{InAs}} - a_{\\mathrm{GaAs}} + b_a$$\n$$x = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{InAs}} - a_{\\mathrm{GaAs}} + b_a}{b_a} = 1 + \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{InAs}} - a_{\\mathrm{GaAs}}}{b_a}$$\nWe now substitute the given numerical values to evaluate this second root:\n- $a_{\\mathrm{InAs}} = 6.058\\,\\text{\\AA}$\n- $a_{\\mathrm{GaAs}} = 5.653\\,\\text{\\AA}$\n- $b_a = 0.02\\,\\text{\\AA}$\n\n$$x = 1 + \\frac{6.058 - 5.653}{0.02} = 1 + \\frac{0.405}{0.02} = 1 + 20.25 = 21.25$$\nThis second solution, $x=21.25$, is not physically admissible because the composition $x$ in an alloy $\\mathrm{In}_x\\mathrm{Ga}_{1-x}\\mathrm{As}$ must be in the range $0 \\le x \\le 1$.\n\nTherefore, the only physically meaningful solution that satisfies the condition of lattice matching to a $\\mathrm{GaAs}$ substrate is $x=0$. This conclusion is physically intuitive: the lattice parameter of $\\mathrm{In}_x\\mathrm{Ga}_{1-x}\\mathrm{As}$ is a monotonically increasing function of $x$ for $x \\in [0,1]$ (as $a_{\\mathrm{InAs}}  a_{\\mathrm{GaAs}}$ and the bowing term is small). The function starts at $a(0) = a_{\\mathrm{GaAs}}$ and ends at $a(1) = a_{\\mathrm{InAs}}$. The only point in this interval where the alloy's lattice parameter can equal that of $\\mathrm{GaAs}$ is at the starting point, $x=0$.",
