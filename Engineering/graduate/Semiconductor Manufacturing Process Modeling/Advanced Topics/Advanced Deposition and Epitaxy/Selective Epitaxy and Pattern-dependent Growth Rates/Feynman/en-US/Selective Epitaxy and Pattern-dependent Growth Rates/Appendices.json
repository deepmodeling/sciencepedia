Model Derivation**\n\nThe problem describes a two-resistance model for epitaxial growth, comprising gas-phase mass transport and surface reaction kinetics.\n\n-   **Gas-Phase Transport:** The flux of the precursor species from the bulk gas to the wafer surface, $J_{transport}$, is modeled using an effective mass-transfer coefficient, $h_m(L)$, as per Fick's law over a characteristic length $L$.\n    $$J_{transport} = h_m(L) (C_b - C_s)$$\n    where $C_b$ is the precursor concentration in the bulk gas and $C_s$ is the concentration at the wafer surface. The problem provides the functional form for $h_m(L)$ as:\n    $$h_m(L) = \\frac{D}{L}$$\n    where $D$ is the effective gas-phase diffusivity.\n\n-   **Surface Reaction:** The incorporation of the precursor into the growing film is described as a first-order reaction with respect to the surface concentration $C_s$. The flux due to this reaction, $J_{reaction}$, is given by:\n    $$J_{reaction} = K_m C_s$$\n    where $K_m$ is the first-order kinetic rate constant.\n\n-   **Steady-State Condition:** Under steady-state operation, the flux of reactants to the surface must equal the flux of reactants consumed by the surface reaction.\n    $$J_{transport} = J_{reaction}$$\n    $$h_m(L) (C_b - C_s) = K_m C_s$$\n\n-   **Relating Flux to Growth Rate:** The window-averaged growth rate, $R_w$, is stated to be proportional to the net reaction flux. Let the proportionality constant be $\\alpha$.\n    $$R_w = \\alpha J_{reaction} = \\alpha K_m C_s$$\n    The reference growth rate, $R_{\\infty}$, corresponds to the reaction-limited case where gas-phase transport is not a limiting factor ($h_m \\to \\infty$). In this limit, the resistance to mass transport is zero, so the surface concentration equals the bulk gas concentration, $C_s \\to C_b$.\n    $$R_{\\infty} = \\alpha K_m C_b$$\n\nNow, we derive the relationship between these quantities. From the steady-state flux balance:\n$$h_m(L) C_b - h_m(L) C_s = K_m C_s$$\n$$h_m(L) C_b = (h_m(L) + K_m) C_s$$\nSolving for the surface concentration $C_s$:\n$$C_s = \\frac{h_m(L)}{h_m(L) + K_m} C_b$$\nSubstitute this expression for $C_s$ into the equation for $R_w$:\n$$R_w = \\alpha K_m \\left( \\frac{h_m(L)}{h_m(L) + K_m} \\right) C_b$$\nWe can form the ratio of $R_w$ to $R_{\\infty}$:\n$$\\frac{R_w}{R_{\\infty}} = \\frac{\\alpha K_m \\left( \\frac{h_m(L)}{h_m(L) + K_m} \\right) C_b}{\\alpha K_m C_b} = \\frac{h_m(L)}{h_m(L) + K_m}$$\nThe problem asks for a relationship involving the ratio $R_{\\infty} / R_w$.

The governing physics (Fickian diffusion, first-order reaction/desorption, constant source) are well-established principles in materials science and transport phenomena. The geometry is an idealization but a standard one for analyzing pattern effects. The problem is formulated as a boundary value problem for a second-order ordinary differential equation, which is a well-posed mathematical structure. The boundary conditions are physically consistent with the model: a perfect sink at the window and an unperturbed concentration far from the sink, where generation and desorption reach a local equilibrium ($S_m - c_m/\\tau_m = 0 \\Rightarrow c_m = S_m\\tau_m$). All necessary parameters are provided, and no contradictions are present. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. The solution will proceed by deriving and solving the governing differential equation for the steady-state adatom concentration, and then using that solution to calculate the total diffusive flux into the window.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nWe begin from the principle of conservation of mass for the adatom concentration $c_m(r)$ in a steady state. Consider a thin annular control volume on the mask between radial positions $r$ and $r+dr$. The mass balance equation is:\n$$\n\\text{Rate of change} = (\\text{Flux in}) - (\\text{Flux out}) + (\\text{Generation}) - (\\text{Loss})\n$$\nIn a steady state, the rate of change is $0$. The total diffusive flux through a circle of radius $r$ is $F(r) = 2\\pi r J_r(r)$, where $J_r(r)$ is the radial component of the diffusive flux density. The mass balance for the annulus is:\n$$\n0 = F(r) - F(r+dr) + S_m (2\\pi r dr) - \\frac{c_m(r)}{\\tau_m} (2\\pi r dr)\n$$\nThe term $F(r) - F(r+dr)$ can be written as $-dF = -\\frac{dF}{dr}dr = -\\frac{d}{dr}(2\\pi r J_r(r)) dr$. Substituting this and dividing by $2\\pi r dr$ gives the differential form of the conservation equation:\n$$\n0 = -\\frac{1}{r} \\frac{d}{dr}(r J_r(r)) + S_m - \\frac{c_m(r)}{\\tau_m}\n$$\nThe constitutive relation for the diffusive flux is Fick's first law, which in this one-dimensional radial system is $J_r(r) = -D_m \\frac{dc_m}{dr}$. Substituting this into the conservation equation yields:\n$$\n0 = -\\frac{1}{r} \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r \\left(-D_m \\frac{dc_m}{dr}\\right)\\right) + S_m - \\frac{c_m(r)}{\\tau_m}\n$$\n$$\nD_m \\frac{1}{r} \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r \\frac{dc_m}{dr}\\right) - \\frac{c_m(r)}{\\tau_m} + S_m = 0\n$$\nExpanding the derivative term gives $\\frac{1}{r} \\left(\\frac{dc_m}{dr} + r \\frac{d^2c_m}{dr^2}\\right) = \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{dc_m}{dr} + \\frac{d^2c_m}{dr^2}$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2c_m}{dr^2} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{dc_m}{dr} - \\frac{1}{D_m \\tau_m}c_m(r) = -\\frac{S_m}{D_m}\n$$\nUsing the definition of the mask diffusion length, $l_m = \\sqrt{D_m \\tau_m}$, the equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{d^2c_m}{dr^2} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{dc_m}{dr} - \\frac{1}{l_m^2}c_m(r) = -\\frac{S_m}{D_m}\n$$\nThis is a non-homogeneous modified Bessel equation of order zero. The general solution is the sum of the homogeneous solution, $c_h(r)$, and a particular solution, $c_p(r)$.\n\nFor the particular solution, we can try a constant, $c_p(r) = C$. Substituting into the ODE gives $0 + 0 - \\frac{C}{l_m^2} = -\\frac{S_m}{D_m}$, which yields $c_p = \\frac{S_m l_m^2}{D_m} = \\frac{S_m (D_m \\tau_m)}{D_m} = S_m \\tau_m$.\n\nThe homogeneous equation is $\\frac{d^2c_h}{dr^2} + \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{dc_h}{dr} - \\frac{1}{l_m^2}c_h(r) = 0$. The general solution to this equation is a linear combination of the modified Bessel functions of order zero:\n$$\nc_h(r) = A I_0\\left(\\frac{r}{l_m}\\right) + B K_0\\left(\\frac{r}{l_m}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $I_0$ is the modified Bessel function of the first kind and $K_0$ is the modified Bessel function of the second kind. The full general solution for the concentration profile is:\n$$\nc_m(r) = A I_0\\left(\\frac{r}{l_m}\\right) + B K_0\\left(\\frac{r}{l_m}\\right) + S_m \\tau_m\n$$\nWe now apply the boundary conditions to find the constants $A$ and $B$.\nFirst, consider the far-field condition: $c_m(r) \\to S_m \\tau_m$ as $r \\to \\infty$. The asymptotic behaviors of the Bessel functions for large arguments are $I_0(z) \\to \\infty$ and $K_0(z) \\to 0$ as $z \\to \\infty$. For the solution to approach the finite limit $S_m \\tau_m$, the coefficient of the divergent term $I_0$ must be zero. Therefore, $A=0$.\nThe solution simplifies to:\n$$\nc_m(r) = B K_0\\left(\\frac{r}{l_m}\\right) + S_m \\tau_m\n$$\nNext, apply the boundary condition at the window edge: $c_m(a) = 0$.\n$$\n0 = B K_0\\left(\\frac{a}{l_m}\\right) + S_m \\tau_m\n$$\nSolving for $B$ gives:\n$$\nB = -\\frac{S_m \\tau_m}{K_0(a/l_m)}\n$$\nSubstituting $B$ back into the solution provides the final expression for the steady-state concentration profile for $r \\ge a$:\n$$\nc_m(r) = S_m \\tau_m \\left(1 - \\frac{K_0(r/l_m)}{K_0(a/l_m)}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we compute the total capture rate into the window, $F_{capture}$. This is the line integral of the inward normal diffusive flux over the circumference at $r=a$. The flux density vector is $\\vec{J} = -D_m \\nabla c_m = -D_m \\frac{dc_m}{dr}\\hat{r}$. The inward normal vector is $-\\hat{r}$. The inward normal flux density is $\\vec{J} \\cdot (-\\hat{r}) = D_m \\frac{dc_m}{dr}$.\nTotal capture rate is the flux density multiplied by the perimeter $2\\pi a$:\n$$\nF_{capture} = 2\\pi a \\left( D_m \\frac{dc_m}{dr}\\Big|_{r=a} \\right)\n$$\nWe need to calculate the derivative of $c_m(r)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dc_m}{dr} = \\frac{d}{dr}\\left[ S_m \\tau_m \\left(1 - \\frac{K_0(r/l_m)}{K_0(a/l_m)}\\right) \\right] = -\\frac{S_m \\tau_m}{K_0(a/l_m)} \\frac{d}{dr}K_0\\left(\\frac{r}{l_m}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the standard identity $\\frac{d}{dz}K_0(z) = -K_1(z)$ and the chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dr}K_0\\left(\\frac{r}{l_m}\\right) = -K_1\\left(\\frac{r}{l_m}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{l_m}\n$$\nThus, the derivative of the concentration is:\n$$\n\\frac{dc_m}{dr} = -\\frac{S_m \\tau_m}{K_0(a/l_m)} \\left( -\\frac{1}{l_m} K_1\\left(\\frac{r}{l_m}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{S_m \\tau_m}{l_m K_0(a/l_m)} K_1\\left(\\frac{r}{l_m}\\right)\n$$\nEvaluating this at $r=a$:\n$$\n\\frac{dc_m}{dr}\\Big|_{r=a} = \\frac{S_m \\tau_m}{l_m K_0(a/l_m)} K_1\\left(\\frac{a}{l_m}\\right)\n$$\nNow, substitute this into the expression for the total capture rate:\n$$\nF_{capture} = 2\\pi a D_m \\left( \\frac{S_m \\tau_m}{l_m K_0(a/l_m)} K_1\\left(\\frac{a}{l_m}\\right) \\right)\n$$\nFinally, we substitute $\\tau_m = l_m^2/D_m$:\n$$\nF_{capture} = 2\\pi a D_m \\left( \\frac{S_m (l_m^2/D_m)}{l_m K_0(a/l_m)} K_1\\left(\\frac{a}{l_m}\\right) \\right) = 2\\pi a D_m \\left( \\frac{S_m l_m}{D_m K_0(a/l_m)} K_1\\left(\\frac{a}{l_m}\\right) \\right)\n$$\nThe diffusion coefficient $D_m$ cancels, yielding the final expression for the total capture rate:\n$$\nF_{capture} = 2\\pi a S_m l_m \\frac{K_1(a/l_m)}{K_0(a/l_m)}\n$$\nThis expression is a function of the given parameters $a$, $S_m$, and $l_m$, and uses standard special functions $K_0$ and $K_1$ as required.",
