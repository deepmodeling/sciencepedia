            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of semiconductor device physics, specifically the Transmission Line Model (TLM) for contact resistance characterization. The problem is well-posed, providing a sufficient and consistent dataset to uniquely determine the requested parameters. The language is objective and the values provided are physically realistic for advanced technology nodes.\n\nWe begin by deriving the relationship for the total measured resistance, $R_{tot}$. The total resistance is the series sum of the resistance of the semiconductor sheet, $R_{sheet}$, and the two contact resistances, one at each end, denoted by $R_c$.\n$$R_{tot} = R_{sheet} + 2R_c$$\nThe resistance of a uniform conductor is given by $R = \\rho \\frac{l}{A}$, where $\\rho$ is the material's resistivity, $l$ is its length, and $A$ is its cross-sectional area. For the semiconductor sheet, the length of the current path is $L$, and the cross-sectional area is $A = W \\cdot t$, where $W$ is the width and $t$ is the thickness.\n$$R_{sheet} = \\rho \\frac{L}{W \\cdot t}$$\nThe sheet resistance, $R_s$, is defined as the resistivity divided by the film thickness, $R_s = \\frac{\\rho}{t}$. Its units are Ohms, conventionally quoted as Ohms/square ($\\Omega/\\text{sq}$) to describe the resistance of a square area of the film. Substituting $R_s$ into the expression for $R_{sheet}$:\n$$R_{sheet} = R_s \\frac{L}{W}$$\nTherefore, the functional dependence of the total two-terminal resistance on device length $L$ and width $W$ is:\n$$R_{tot}(L, W) = R_s \\frac{L}{W} + 2R_c$$\nFor a fixed width $W$, this equation describes a linear relationship between $R_{tot}$ and $L$, of the form $y = mx + b$, where $y=R_{tot}$, $x=L$, the slope is $m = \\frac{R_s}{W}$, and the y-intercept is $b = 2R_c$.\n\nWe are given the following data set for a fixed width $W=0.1\\,\\mu\\text{m}$:\n$R_{tot} = \\{500, 600, 700\\}\\,\\Omega$ at $L = \\{0.05, 0.1, 0.15\\}\\,\\mu\\text{m}$.\nWe can determine the slope $m$ from any two points.

Now, we extract the parameters $R_s$ and $R_c$.\nFrom the slope, we find the sheet resistance $R_s$:\n$$R_s = m \\cdot W = \\left(2000\\,\\frac{\\Omega}{\\mu\\text{m}}\\right) \\cdot (0.1\\,\\mu\\text{m}) = 200\\,\\Omega$$\nThe y-intercept $b$ corresponds to the total resistance at zero length ($L=0$), which is $2R_c$. We can find $b$ by extrapolating the line to $L=0$ using any data point, for instance the first one $(L_1, R_1) = (0.05\\,\\mu\\text{m}, 500\\,\\Omega)$:\n$$b = R_1 - m L_1 = 500\\,\\Omega - \\left(2000\\,\\frac{\\Omega}{\\mu\\text{m}}\\right) \\cdot (0.05\\,\\mu\\text{m}) = 500\\,\\Omega - 100\\,\\Omega = 400\\,\\Omega$$\nFrom the intercept, we find the contact resistance per contact, $R_c$:\n$$2R_c = b = 400\\,\\Omega \\implies R_c = 200\\,\\Omega$$\n\nNext, we model the current crowding effect to relate $R_c$ to the specific contact resistivity, $\\rho_c$. The contact resistance for a contact of width $W$ and length $L_c$ is given by the one-dimensional transfer-line model:\n$$R_c = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\rho_c R_s}}{W} \\coth\\left(\\frac{L_c}{L_T}\\right)$$\nwhere $L_T = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho_c}{R_s}}$ is the transfer length. The problem specifies the long-contact limit, where $L_c \\gg L_T$. In this limit, the argument of the hyperbolic cotangent is large, and $\\coth(x) \\to 1$ as $x \\to \\infty$. The expression for $R_c$ simplifies to:\n$$R_c \\approx \\frac{\\sqrt{\\rho_c R_s}}{W}$$\nWe are asked to determine $\\rho_c$.

            "problem": "A nanoscale source/drain contact in a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) device at an advanced technology node can be modeled by a one-dimensional distributed resistive sheet under a rectangular metal contact. The semiconductor under the contact exhibits sheet resistance $R_s$ and is coupled to the metal through a finite interfacial conductance per unit area governed by the specific contact resistivity $\\rho_c$. Consider a contact of width $W$ (transverse to current flow along the sheet) and length $L_c$ (along the current flow direction beneath the contact). Assume the metal is held at zero potential and the semiconductor potential under the contact varies along the length direction $x\\in[0,L_c]$. Let $V(x)$ be the potential of the semiconductor with respect to the metal and $I(x)$ be the lateral current flowing along the semiconductor in the $+x$ direction. Use the following fundamental relations:\n- Ohm’s law for the distributed sheet: the differential resistance of a strip of length $\\mathrm{d}x$ and width $W$ is $\\mathrm{d}R = R_s\\,\\mathrm{d}x/W$, so the potential gradient is related to the lateral current by $\\mathrm{d}V/\\mathrm{d}x = -\\left(R_s/W\\right) I(x)$, with the minus sign chosen so that $V$ decreases along the direction of $I$.\n- Current continuity with vertical injection into the metal: the rate of change of lateral current equals the negative of the vertical current leaving the sheet, $\\mathrm{d}I/\\mathrm{d}x = - W\\,g_c\\,V(x)$, where $g_c$ is the contact conductance per unit area and satisfies $g_c = 1/\\rho_c$ by definition of the specific contact resistivity.\n\nStarting from these principles, derive the governing equation for $V(x)$, solve it subject to physically consistent boundary conditions for a finite contact, and from that obtain the effective contact resistance $R_c$ (defined as the ratio of the semiconductor potential at $x=0$ to the total current injected under the contact) as a function of $R_s$, $\\rho_c$, $W$, and $L_c$.

The provided equations are the defining relations of this model. The problem is based on established physical principles (Ohm's law, current continuity) and is formulated in precise, objective language.\n2.  **Well-Posed and Complete**: The problem is self-contained. It provides the governing equations, defines all variables, and specifies the goal of deriving the contact resistance $R_c$. The boundary conditions, while not explicitly stated, are standard and can be deduced from the physical description of a finite contact (i.e., no current flows in the semiconductor sheet beyond the contact end). The problem asks for a unique solution and subsequent numerical evaluation, which is a well-posed task. There are no contradictions.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically sound, well-posed, and complete. It is a valid problem from the field of semiconductor process modeling. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Governing Equation\nWe start with the two coupled first-order linear differential equations provided:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}V}{\\mathrm{d}x} = -\\frac{R_s}{W} I(x) \\quad (1) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}I}{\\mathrm{d}x} = - W g_c V(x) \\quad (2) $$\nTo obtain a single governing equation for the potential $V(x)$, we differentiate equation $(1)$ with respect to $x$:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2V}{\\mathrm{d}x^2} = -\\frac{R_s}{W} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}I}{\\mathrm{d}x} $$\nNow, we substitute equation $(2)$ into this result:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2V}{\\mathrm{d}x^2} = -\\frac{R_s}{W} \\left(-W g_c V(x)\\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2V}{\\mathrm{d}x^2} = R_s g_c V(x) $$\nUsing the definition $g_c = 1/\\rho_c$, we get:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2V}{\\mathrm{d}x^2} = \\frac{R_s}{\\rho_c} V(x) $$\nThis is a second-order linear homogeneous ordinary differential equation. We can rewrite it in a standard form by defining a characteristic length, which emerges naturally from the coefficients:\n$$ L_T = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho_c}{R_s}} $$\nThe equation for $V(x)$ then becomes:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2V}{\\mathrm{d}x^2} - \\frac{1}{L_T^2} V(x) = 0 $$\nThe characteristic length $L_T$ is known as the **transfer length**. It represents the average distance that current travels laterally in the semiconductor sheet before transferring vertically into the overlying metal contact. For contact lengths $L_c \\gg L_T$, most of the current transfer occurs near the edge of the contact at $x=0$, leaving the rest of the contact length electrically underutilized.\n\n### Solution of the Governing Equation\nThe general solution to the derived differential equation can be written in terms of hyperbolic functions:\n$$ V(x) = A \\cosh\\left(\\frac{x}{L_T}\\right) + B \\sinh\\left(\\frac{x}{L_T}\\right) $$\nTo find the constants $A$ and $B$, we must apply physically consistent boundary conditions. The current $I(x)$ is found by substituting this solution back into equation $(1)$:\n$$ I(x) = -\\frac{W}{R_s} \\frac{\\mathrm{d}V}{\\mathrm{d}x} = -\\frac{W}{R_s L_T} \\left( A \\sinh\\left(\\frac{x}{L_T}\\right) + B \\cosh\\left(\\frac{x}{L_T}\\right) \\right) $$\nThe physical system described is a finite contact of length $L_c$. It is physically necessary that the lateral current in the semiconductor sheet falls to zero at the end of the contact, $x=L_c$, since there is no path for it to continue beyond this point. Thus, the boundary condition is $I(L_c) = 0$.\n$$ I(L_c) = -\\frac{W}{R_s L_T} \\left( A \\sinh\\left(\\frac{L_c}{L_T}\\right) + B \\cosh\\left(\\frac{L_c}{L_T}\\right) \\right) = 0 $$\nThis implies:\n$$ A \\sinh\\left(\\frac{L_c}{L_T}\\right) = -B \\cosh\\left(\\frac{L_c}{L_T}\\right) \\implies A = -B \\frac{\\cosh(L_c/L_T)}{\\sinh(L_c/L_T)} = -B \\coth\\left(\\frac{L_c}{L_T}\\right) $$\nSubstituting this expression for $A$ back into the solution for $V(x)$:\n$$ V(x) = -B \\coth\\left(\\frac{L_c}{L_T}\\right) \\cosh\\left(\\frac{x}{L_T}\\right) + B \\sinh\\left(\\frac{x}{L_T}\\right) $$\n$$ V(x) = \\frac{B}{\\sinh(L_c/L_T)} \\left[ \\sinh\\left(\\frac{x}{L_T}\\right)\\sinh\\left(\\frac{L_c}{L_T}\\right) - \\cosh\\left(\\frac{x}{L_T}\\right)\\cosh\\left(\\frac{L_c}{L_T}\\right) \\right] $$\nUsing the hyperbolic identity $\\cosh(u-v) = \\cosh(u)\\cosh(v) - \\sinh(u)\\sinh(v)$, we can simplify the expression:\n$$ V(x) = -\\frac{B}{\\sinh(L_c/L_T)} \\cosh\\left(\\frac{L_c-x}{L_T}\\right) $$\nLet $C = -B/\\sinh(L_c/L_T)$ be a new constant. The solution for the potential is:\n$$ V(x) = C \\cosh\\left(\\frac{L_c-x}{L_T}\\right) $$\n\n### Derivation of the Contact Resistance $R_c$\nThe effective contact resistance $R_c$ is defined as the ratio of the potential at the input of the contact, $V(0)$, to the total current entering the contact, $I(0)$.\nThe potential at $x=0$ is:\n$$ V(0) = C \\cosh\\left(\\frac{L_c}{L_T}\\right) $$\nThe current at $x=0$ is:\n$$ I(0) = -\\frac{W}{R_s} \\left.\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right|_{x=0} $$\nFirst, find the derivative of $V(x)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\mathrm{d}V}{\\mathrm{d}x} = C \\sinh\\left(\\frac{L_c-x}{L_T}\\right) \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{L_T}\\right) $$\nAt $x=0$:\n$$ \\left.\\frac{\\mathrm{d}V}{\\mathrm{d}x}\\right|_{x=0} = -\\frac{C}{L_T} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{L_c}{L_T}\\right) $$\nSo, the input current is:\n$$ I(0) = -\\frac{W}{R_s} \\left( -\\frac{C}{L_T} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{L_c}{L_T}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{W C}{R_s L_T} \\sinh\\left(\\frac{L_c}{L_T}\\right) $$\nNow, we can compute $R_c$:\n$$ R_c = \\frac{V(0)}{I(0)} = \\frac{C \\cosh(L_c/L_T)}{\\frac{W C}{R_s L_T} \\sinh(L_c/L_T)} = \\frac{R_s L_T}{W} \\frac{\\cosh(L_c/L_T)}{\\sinh(L_c/L_T)} $$\n$$ R_c = \\frac{R_s L_T}{W} \\coth\\left(\\frac{L_c}{L_T}\\right) $$\nSubstituting the definition $L_T = \\sqrt{\\rho_c/R_s}$:\n$$ R_c = \\frac{R_s}{W} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho_c}{R_s}} \\coth\\left(\\frac{L_c}{\\sqrt{\\rho_c/R_s}}\\right) = \\frac{\\sqrt{R_s \\rho_c}}{W} \\coth\\left(\\frac{L_c}{L_T}\\right) $$\nThis is the final analytical expression for the contact resistance.\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nWe are given the following parameters:\n- $R_s = 800\\,\\Omega/\\square$ (The \"per square\" is a unit convention for sheet resistance; the value is used as $800\\,\\Omega$ in calculations).\n- $\\rho_c = 5\\times 10^{-9}\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{cm}^2 = 5\\times 10^{-9} \\times (10^{-2}\\,\\text{m})^2 = 5\\times 10^{-13}\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{m}^2$.\n- $W = 0.05\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 0.05 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m} = 5 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\text{m}$.\n- $L_c = 0.1\\,\\mu\\text{m} = 0.1 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{m} = 1 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{m}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the transfer length $L_T$:\n$$ L_T = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\rho_c}{R_s}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{5\\times 10^{-13}\\,\\Omega\\cdot\\text{m}^2}{800\\,\\Omega}} = \\sqrt{6.25 \\times 10^{-16}\\,\\text{m}^2} = 2.5 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\text{m} $$\nNext, we compute the dimensionless ratio $\\alpha = L_c/L_T$ to quantify the \"long-contact\" condition:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{L_c}{L_T} = \\frac{1 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\text{m}}{2.5 \\times 10^{-8}\\,\\text{m}} = 4 $$\nThe ratio $\\alpha=4$ indicates that the contact length is $4$ times the characteristic transfer length.

            "solution": "The problem is valid. It is scientifically grounded in established semiconductor physics principles, provides a complete and consistent set of definitions and parameters, and is well-posed, admitting a unique solution for each test case. The physical models, while incorporating standard approximations, are appropriate for engineering-level analysis of contact resistance.\n\nThe objective is to compute the effective specific contact resistivity, $\\rho_{c,\\mathrm{eff}}$, for a Metal-Semiconductor (M-S) contact where the semiconductor donor concentration, $N_D$, varies spatially along the contact plane. The solution requires a multi-step calculation integrating concepts from electrostatics and quantum mechanical tunneling, implemented via numerical methods. We will work entirely in International System of Units (SI) for all physical calculations and perform a unit conversion only for the final reported result.\n\nFirst, we define the physical constants in SI units as provided:\n- Elementary charge: $q = 1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n- Reduced Planck constant: $\\hbar = 1.054571817 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\mathrm{J\\cdot s}$\n- Electron rest mass: $m_e = 9.1093837015 \\times 10^{-31}\\,\\mathrm{kg}$\n- Vacuum permittivity: $\\varepsilon_0 = 8.854187817 \\times 10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}$\n- Relative permittivity of silicon: $\\varepsilon_r = 11.7$\n- Permittivity of silicon: $\\varepsilon_s = \\varepsilon_r \\varepsilon_0 = 11.7 \\times 8.854187817 \\times 10^{-12} \\approx 1.0359 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{F/m}$\n\nThe computational procedure for each test case is as follows. Each test case provides the parameters $(N_{\\mathrm{surf}}, N_{\\mathrm{deep}}, L, p, \\psi_s, \\Phi_B, m^*/m_e, g_0)$. We first convert the input parameters to SI units: $N_{\\mathrm{surf}}$ and $N_{\\mathrm{deep}}$ from $\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ to $\\mathrm{m}^{-3}$ (by multiplying by $10^6$), and $L$ from $\\mathrm{nm}$ to $\\mathrm{m}$ (by multiplying by $10^{-9}$).\n\nStep 1: Spatially-Varying Donor Concentration, $N_D(x)$\nThe model begins with a position-dependent donor concentration $N_D(x)$ across the contact length $L$. The profile is described by a power-law function over the domain $x \\in [0, L]$:\n$$N_D(x) = N_{\\mathrm{surf}} + \\left(N_{\\mathrm{deep}} - N_{\\mathrm{surf}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{x}{L}\\right)^p$$\nHere, $N_{\\mathrm{surf}}$ and $N_{\\mathrm{deep}}$ are the donor concentrations at the boundaries $x=0$ and $x=L$ respectively, and the exponent $p$ controls the shape of the gradient.\n\nStep 2: Local Depletion Width, $W_d(x)$, and Electric Field, $F(x)$\nThe local donor concentration $N_D(x)$ determines the width of the depletion region $W_d(x)$ under the contact at each position $x$. Using the standard formula for a one-sided abrupt junction, applied locally:\n$$W_d(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\,\\varepsilon_s \\,\\psi_s}{q \\,N_D(x)}}$$\nwhere $\\psi_s$ is the surface potential. The electric field $F(x)$ across this depletion region, approximated as a uniform field, is given by:\n$$F(x) = \\frac{\\psi_s}{W_d(x)}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $W_d(x)$ into the equation for $F(x)$ yields a more direct relationship between the field and the doping concentration:\n$$F(x) = \\frac{\\psi_s}{\\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\,\\varepsilon_s \\,\\psi_s}{q \\,N_D(x)}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{q \\, \\psi_s \\, N_D(x)}{2 \\, \\varepsilon_s}}$$\nThis shows the local electric field is proportional to the square root of the local donor concentration.\n\nStep 3: Tunneling Transmission, $T(x)$\nThe probability of an electron tunneling through the potential barrier at the M-S interface is given by the WKB approximation. For a triangular barrier, the transmission probability $T(x)$ depends exponentially on the electric field $F(x)$:\n$$T(x) = \\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{C}{F(x)}\\right)$$\nThe constant $C$ encapsulates properties of the barrier and the electron:\n$$C = \\frac{4 \\sqrt{2 m^* q}\\, \\Phi_B^{3/2}}{3 \\hbar}$$\nwhere $m^*$ is the electron effective mass and $\\Phi_B$ is the barrier height in volts. A higher electric field $F(x)$ (resulting from higher doping $N_D(x)$) leads to a thinner effective barrier, increasing the transmission probability $T(x)$.\n\nStep 4: Local Conductance Density, $g(x)$\nThe local specific conductance density, $g(x)$, is assumed to be directly proportional to the tunneling probability:\n$$g(x) = g_0 \\, T(x)$$\nwhere $g_0$ is a constant prefactor. Substituting the expressions from the previous steps, we obtain the full expression for the integrand:\n$$g(x) = g_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{C}{\\sqrt{\\frac{q \\, \\psi_s \\, N_D(x)}{2 \\, \\varepsilon_s}}}\\right)$$\n\nStep 5: Effective Specific Contact Resistivity, $\\rho_{c,\\mathrm{eff}}$\nThe total conductance of the contact is the sum of parallel contributions from each infinitesimal strip $dx$. Thus, the average specific conductance density, $\\overline{g}$, is the spatial average of $g(x)$ over the contact length $L$:\n$$\\overline{g} = \\frac{1}{L} \\int_0^L g(x)\\, dx$$\nThe effective specific contact resistivity, $\\rho_{c,\\mathrm{eff}}$, is the reciprocal of this average conductance density:\n$$\\rho_{c,\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{1}{\\overline{g}} = \\left(\\frac{1}{L} \\int_0^L g(x)\\, dx \\right)^{-1}$$\nThe integral is not analytically tractable for a general power $p$ and must be computed numerically. We use a numerical quadrature method to evaluate $\\int_0^L g(x)\\, dx$. The resulting $\\rho_{c,\\mathrm{eff}}$ is in SI units of $\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^2$.\n\nFinal Step: Unit Conversion\nThe problem requires the final answer in units of $\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^2$. We perform the conversion:\n$$\\rho_{c,\\mathrm{eff}} \\, [\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{cm}^2] = \\rho_{c,\\mathrm{eff}} \\, [\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^2] \\times (100 \\, \\mathrm{cm/m})^2 = \\rho_{c,\\mathrm{eff}} \\, [\\Omega\\cdot\\mathrm{m}^2] \\times 10^4$$\nThis procedure is applied to each test case to generate the final list of results.",
