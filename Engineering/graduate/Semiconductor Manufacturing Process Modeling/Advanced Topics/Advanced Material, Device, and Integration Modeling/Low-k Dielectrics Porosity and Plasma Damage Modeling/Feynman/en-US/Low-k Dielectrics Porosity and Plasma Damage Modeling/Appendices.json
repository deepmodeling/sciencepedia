The problem is well-posed, with all necessary parameters and assumptions clearly stated to derive and compare two common effective medium models: the Maxwell–Garnett and Bruggeman approximations. The terminology is objective and precise. The physical values given are realistic for porous low-k dielectrics in semiconductor manufacturing. The problem asks for derivations from first principles, numerical evaluation, and comparison. All these aspects are standard and valid within a scientific and pedagogical context. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe derivation and calculation will be performed in four parts:\n1.  Derivation of the Maxwell–Garnett (MG) effective medium formula.\n2.  Derivation of the symmetric Bruggeman (Bru) self-consistent relation.\n3.  Numerical evaluation of the effective permittivities $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{MG}}$ and $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{Bru}}$.\n4.  Calculation of the absolute relative difference $\\delta$.\n\nThe fundamental equations are the macroscopic Maxwell's equations and the constitutive relation for a linear, isotropic dielectric:\n$$ \\mathbf{D} = \\varepsilon \\mathbf{E} = \\varepsilon_0 k \\mathbf{E} $$\nwhere $\\mathbf{D}$ is the electric displacement field, $\\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field, $\\varepsilon$ is the permittivity, $\\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of vacuum, and $k$ is the relative permittivity (dielectric constant).\n\nFor a composite material, we define an effective relative permittivity $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ that relates the volume-averaged fields:\n$$ \\langle \\mathbf{D} \\rangle = \\varepsilon_0 k_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\langle \\mathbf{E} \\rangle $$\nThe volume averages are given by:\n$$ \\langle \\mathbf{D} \\rangle = (1-f)\\mathbf{D}_m + f\\mathbf{D}_i = \\varepsilon_0((1-f)k_m \\mathbf{E}_m + f k_i \\mathbf{E}_i) $$\n$$ \\langle \\mathbf{E} \\rangle = (1-f)\\mathbf{E}_m + f\\mathbf{E}_i $$\nwhere the subscripts $m$ and $i$ refer to the matrix and inclusion phases, respectively, and $f$ is the volume fraction of the inclusions.\n\nA crucial result from electrostatics is that for a single spherical inclusion of relative permittivity $k_i$ embedded in a host medium of relative permittivity $k_m$ subjected to a uniform far-field $\\mathbf{E}_m$, the electric field $\\mathbf{E}_i$ inside the inclusion is uniform and given by:\n$$ \\mathbf{E}_i = \\frac{3 k_m}{k_i + 2 k_m} \\mathbf{E}_m $$\n\n**1. Derivation of the Maxwell–Garnett (MG) Formula**\n\nThe Maxwell–Garnett model assumes an asymmetrical microstructure where one phase (the matrix, $m$) is continuous and hosts the other phase (the inclusions, $i$). In this problem, the SiCOH matrix with $k_m = 2.7$ is the host, and the vacuum pores with $k_i = 1$ are the inclusions. The volume fraction of inclusions is $f=0.30$.\n\nThe field within the matrix is denoted by $\\mathbf{E}_m$. The field inside the spherical inclusions, $\\mathbf{E}_i$, is related to $\\mathbf{E}_m$ by the electrostatic result mentioned above. We can now express the average fields $\\langle \\mathbf{D} \\rangle$ and $\\langle \\mathbf{E} \\rangle$ solely in terms of $\\mathbf{E}_m$.\n\nSubstitute $\\mathbf{E}_i$ into the expressions for the average fields:\n$$ \\langle \\mathbf{D} \\rangle = \\varepsilon_0 \\left[ (1-f)k_m \\mathbf{E}_m + f k_i \\left(\\frac{3 k_m}{k_i + 2 k_m} \\mathbf{E}_m\\right) \\right] = \\varepsilon_0 \\mathbf{E}_m \\left[ (1-f)k_m + \\frac{3 f k_i k_m}{k_i + 2 k_m} \\right] $$\n$$ \\langle \\mathbf{E} \\rangle = (1-f)\\mathbf{E}_m + f \\mathbf{E}_i = (1-f)\\mathbf{E}_m + f \\left(\\frac{3 k_m}{k_i + 2 k_m} \\mathbf{E}_m\\right) = \\mathbf{E}_m \\left[ 1-f + \\frac{3 f k_m}{k_i + 2 k_m} \\right] $$\n\nNow, using the definition of the effective permittivity, $\\langle \\mathbf{D} \\rangle = \\varepsilon_0 k_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{MG}} \\langle \\mathbf{E} \\rangle$, we can equate the expressions:\n$$ \\varepsilon_0 \\mathbf{E}_m \\left[ (1-f)k_m + \\frac{3 f k_i k_m}{k_i + 2 k_m} \\right] = \\varepsilon_0 k_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{MG}} \\left( \\mathbf{E}_m \\left[ 1-f + \\frac{3 f k_m}{k_i + 2 k_m} \\right] \\right) $$\nThe term $\\varepsilon_0 \\mathbf{E}_m$ cancels out. We solve for $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{MG}}$:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{MG}} = \\frac{(1-f)k_m + \\frac{3 f k_i k_m}{k_i + 2 k_m}}{1-f + \\frac{3 f k_m}{k_i + 2 k_m}} $$\nTo simplify this into a more standard form, we multiply the numerator and denominator by $(k_i + 2k_m)$:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{MG}} = \\frac{(1-f)k_m(k_i + 2k_m) + 3 f k_i k_m}{(1-f)(k_i + 2k_m) + 3 f k_m} $$\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{MG}} = k_m \\frac{(1-f)(k_i + 2k_m) + 3 f k_i}{k_i + 2k_m - f(k_i+2k_m) + 3fk_m} = k_m \\frac{k_i+2k_m - f k_i - 2fk_m + 3fk_i}{k_i+2k_m - fk_i - 2fk_m + 3fk_m} $$\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{MG}} = k_m \\frac{k_i+2k_m + 2f(k_i-k_m)}{k_i+2k_m - f(k_i-k_m)} $$\nLet $\\beta = \\frac{k_i - k_m}{k_i + 2k_m}$. The expression becomes $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{MG}} = k_m \\frac{1 + 2f\\beta}{1-f\\beta}$. Rearranging this gives:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{MG}}(1-f\\beta) = k_m(1+2f\\beta) \\implies k_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{MG}} - k_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{MG}} f\\beta = k_m + 2k_m f\\beta $$\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{MG}} - k_m = f\\beta (k_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{MG}} + 2k_m) $$\nThis yields the final Maxwell–Garnett formula:\n$$ \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{MG}} - k_m}{k_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{MG}} + 2k_m} = f \\frac{k_i - k_m}{k_i + 2k_m} $$\n\n**2. Derivation of the Bruggeman (Bru) Formula**\n\nThe Bruggeman model assumes a symmetric, random microstructure where neither phase can be uniquely identified as the host or inclusion. It is a self-consistent theory. The fundamental principle is that if we consider a single grain of either constituent ($m$ or $i$) to be embedded in the *effective medium* (with permittivity $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{Bru}}$), the volume-averaged polarization fluctuation must be zero.\n\nThe induced dipole moment $\\mathbf{p}_j$ of a spherical grain of material $j$ with permittivity $k_j$ and volume $V_0$ placed in an effective medium with permittivity $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ under an applied field $\\mathbf{E}_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is given by:\n$$ \\mathbf{p}_j = V_0 \\cdot 3\\varepsilon_0 k_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\frac{k_j - k_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{k_j + 2k_{\\mathrm{eff}}} \\mathbf{E}_{\\mathrm{eff}} $$\nThe contribution to polarization from this type of grain is proportional to $\\frac{k_j - k_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{k_j + 2k_{\\mathrm{eff}}}$.\nThe self-consistency condition requires that the volume-weighted average of these contributions from both constituent phases sums to zero:\n$$ (1-f) \\frac{k_m - k_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{Bru}}}{k_m + 2k_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{Bru}}} + f \\frac{k_i - k_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{Bru}}}{k_i + 2k_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{Bru}}} = 0 $$\nThis is the implicit symmetric Bruggeman relation for a two-phase composite of spherical constituents.\n\n**3. Numerical Evaluation**\n\nThe given parameters are $k_m = 2.7$ (matrix), $k_i = 1$ (inclusions/pores), and $f = 0.30$ (porosity).\n\n**Maxwell–Garnett Permittivity ($k_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{MG}}$):**\nUsing the explicit form derived earlier:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{MG}} = k_m \\frac{k_i+2k_m + 2f(k_i-k_m)}{k_i+2k_m - f(k_i-k_m)} $$\nSubstitute the values:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{MG}} = 2.7 \\frac{1+2(2.7) + 2(0.30)(1-2.7)}{1+2(2.7) - 0.30(1-2.7)} $$\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{MG}} = 2.7 \\frac{1+5.4 + 0.6(-1.7)}{1+5.4 - 0.3(-1.7)} = 2.7 \\frac{6.4 - 1.02}{6.4 + 0.51} = 2.7 \\frac{5.38}{6.91} $$\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{MG}} = 2.7 \\times 0.778581765... = 2.10217076... $$\n\n**Bruggeman Permittivity ($k_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{Bru}}$):**\nLet $x = k_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{\\mathrm{Bru}}$.

The effective in-plane modulus $E_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is the thickness-weighted arithmetic average:\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{t_{1}}{T}\\,E_{1} + \\frac{t_{2}}{T}\\,E_{2},\n$$\nwhere $E_{i} = E_{s}\\,\\left(1 - C\\,\\phi_{i}\\right)^{n}$.\n\nCompute the layer moduli:\n$$\nE_{1} = 70\\,\\mathrm{GPa}\\,\\left(1 - 1 \\times 0.30\\right)^{3} = 70\\,\\mathrm{GPa}\\,\\left(0.70\\right)^{3} = 70\\,\\mathrm{GPa}\\,\\times 0.343 = 24.01\\ \\mathrm{GPa},\n$$\n$$\nE_{2} = 70\\,\\mathrm{GPa}\\,\\left(1 - 1 \\times 0.35\\right)^{3} = 19.22375\\ \\mathrm{GPa},\n$$\nidentical to $E_{0}$ because the bottom retains the original porosity.\n\nThickness fractions are\n$$\n\\frac{t_{1}}{T} = \\frac{20}{100} = 0.20,\\qquad \\frac{t_{2}}{T} = \\frac{80}{100} = 0.80.\n$$\nTherefore,\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 0.20 \\times 24.01\\ \\mathrm{GPa} + 0.80 \\times 19.22375\\ \\mathrm{GPa}.\n$$\nCompute each term:\n$$\n0.20 \\times 24.01 = 4.802,\\qquad 0.80 \\times 19.22375 = 15.379,\n$$\nso\n$$\nE_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 4.802 + 15.379 = 20.181\\ \\mathrm{GPa}.\n$$\n\n3. Rounding to four significant figures and reporting in $\\mathrm{GPa}$:\n$$\nE_{0} \\approx 19.22\\ \\mathrm{GPa},\\qquad E_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx 20.18\\ \\mathrm{GPa}.\n$$\n\nThese values quantify the baseline modulus of the uniform porous film and the effective in-plane modulus after plasma-induced near-surface densification. The increase reflects reduced porosity in the top layer, consistent with the scaling law and parallel load-sharing homogenization.",
