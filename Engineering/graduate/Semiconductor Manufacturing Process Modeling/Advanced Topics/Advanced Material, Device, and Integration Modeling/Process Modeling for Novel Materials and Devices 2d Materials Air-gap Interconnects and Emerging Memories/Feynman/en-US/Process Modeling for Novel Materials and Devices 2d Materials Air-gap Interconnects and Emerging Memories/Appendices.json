In the two-sublattice basis $\\{|A\\rangle, |B\\rangle\\}$, and with on-site energies set to zero, the Hamiltonian matrix in momentum space, $H(\\mathbf{k})$, can be constructed. The diagonal elements are zero because there is no hopping within the same sublattice: $H_{AA}(\\mathbf{k}) = H_{BB}(\\mathbf{k}) = 0$.\n\nThe off-diagonal element $H_{AB}(\\mathbf{k})$ represents the coupling from an orbital on sublattice $B$ to an orbital on sublattice $A$. Using Bloch's theorem, this term is a sum over the nearest-neighbor vectors, which connect sites on different sublattices. If the vectors $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_j$ point from an $A$-site to its nearest $B$-neighbors, then the vectors from a $B$-site to its nearest $A$-neighbors are $-\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_j$. The matrix element $H_{AB}(\\mathbf{k})$ involves a phase factor $e^{i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot (-\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_j)}$ for each neighbor. The convention usually sets $H_{AB}(\\mathbf{k}) = -t \\sum_j e^{i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_j}$ or its complex conjugate, depending on the basis ordering and definition of $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_j$. Let's define it as $H_{BA}(\\mathbf{k})$ for coupling a state on A to B, which involves phases $e^{i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_j}$. Let's define the basis as $(|A\\rangle, |B\\rangle)$. Then $H_{AB}(\\mathbf{k})$ couples $|B\\rangle$ to $|A\\rangle$. The vectors from a site on B to its neighbors on A are $-\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_j$.\n$$H_{AB}(\\mathbf{k}) = -t \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\exp(i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot (-\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_j)) = -t \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\exp(-i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_j)$$\nThe Hamiltonian must be Hermitian, so $H_{BA}(\\mathbf{k}) = H_{AB}^*(\\mathbf{k}) = -t \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\exp(i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_j)$.\nLet's define the function $h(\\mathbf{k}) = \\sum_{j=1}^{3} \\exp(i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_j)$. Then the Hamiltonian is\n$$ H(\\mathbf{k}) = \\begin{pmatrix} H_{AA} & H_{AB} \\\\ H_{BA} & H_{BB} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -t h^*(\\mathbf{k}) \\\\ -t h(\\mathbf{k}) & 0 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThe energy eigenvalues $E(\\mathbf{k})$ are found by solving the characteristic equation $\\det(H(\\mathbf{k}) - E\\mathbf{I}) = 0$:\n$$ \\begin{vmatrix} -E & -t h^*(\\mathbf{k}) \\\\ -t h(\\mathbf{k}) & -E \\end{vmatrix} = E^2 - t^2 |h(\\mathbf{k})|^2 = 0 $$\nThis gives the energy dispersion relation:\n$$ E(\\mathbf{k}) = \\pm t |h(\\mathbf{k})| $$\nThe condition for band touching (where the conduction and valence bands meet) is $E(\\mathbf{k})=0$, which requires $|h(\\mathbf{k})|=0$, or simply $h(\\mathbf{k})=0$. These points are the Dirac points.\n\nLet's evaluate $h(\\mathbf{k})$ with $\\mathbf{k} = (k_x, k_y)$ and the given $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_j$ vectors:\n$$ h(\\mathbf{k}) = \\exp(iak_y) + \\exp\\left(ia\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}k_x - \\frac{1}{2}k_y\\right)\\right) + \\exp\\left(ia\\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}k_x - \\frac{1}{2}k_y\\right)\\right) $$\n$$ h(\\mathbf{k}) = \\exp(iak_y) + 2\\exp\\left(-\\frac{iak_y}{2}\\right)\\cos\\left(\\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2}k_x\\right) $$\nThe Dirac points $\\mathbf{K}$ are solutions to $h(\\mathbf{K})=0$. These are known to be at the corners of the first Brillouin zone. One such point can be found to be $\\mathbf{K} = \\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{3\\sqrt{3}a}, 0\\right)$. Let's verify: at this $\\mathbf{K}$, $k_y=0$ and $\\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2}k_x = \\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\frac{4\\pi}{3\\sqrt{3}a} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$.\n$$ h(\\mathbf{K}) = \\exp(0) + 2\\exp(0)\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right) = 1 + 2\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 0 $$\nSo, $\\mathbf{K} = \\left(\\frac{4\\pi}{3\\sqrt{3}a}, 0\\right)$ is indeed a Dirac point.\n\nTo find the low-energy dispersion, we linearize $h(\\mathbf{k})$ around this Dirac point $\\mathbf{K}$ by considering a small momentum deviation $\\mathbf{q}=(q_x, q_y)$, such that $\\mathbf{k} = \\mathbf{K}+\\mathbf{q}$.\n$$ h(\\mathbf{K}+\\mathbf{q}) \\approx h(\\mathbf{K}) + \\mathbf{q} \\cdot \\nabla_{\\mathbf{k}}h(\\mathbf{k}) \\Big|_{\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{K}} = q_x \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial k_x}\\Big|_{\\mathbf{K}} + q_y \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial k_y}\\Big|_{\\mathbf{K}} $$\nWe calculate the partial derivatives of $h(\\mathbf{k}) = \\sum_j \\exp(i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_j)$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial k_x} = \\sum_j i\\delta_{j,x} \\exp(i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_j), \\quad \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial k_y} = \\sum_j i\\delta_{j,y} \\exp(i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_j) $$\nAt $\\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{K}$, the phase factors are $\\mathbf{K} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_1 = 0$, $\\mathbf{K} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_2 = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$, and $\\mathbf{K} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_3 = -\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$.\nThe components of the $\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_j$ vectors are $\\delta_{1,x}=0$, $\\delta_{1,y}=a$; $\\delta_{2,x}=\\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2}$, $\\delta_{2,y}=-\\frac{a}{2}$; $\\delta_{3,x}=-\\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2}$, $\\delta_{3,y}=-\\frac{a}{2}$.\n\nEvaluating the derivatives at $\\mathbf{K}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial k_x}\\Big|_{\\mathbf{K}} = i \\left[ (0)\\exp(i0) + \\left(\\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)\\exp\\left(\\frac{i2\\pi}{3}\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{i2\\pi}{3}\\right) \\right] $$\n$$ = i\\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\left[ \\exp\\left(\\frac{i2\\pi}{3}\\right) - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{i2\\pi}{3}\\right) \\right] = i\\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\left[ 2i\\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right) \\right] = -a\\sqrt{3}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{3a}{2} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial k_y}\\Big|_{\\mathbf{K}} = i \\left[ (a)\\exp(i0) + \\left(-\\frac{a}{2}\\right)\\exp\\left(\\frac{i2\\pi}{3}\\right) + \\left(-\\frac{a}{2}\\right)\\exp\\left(-\\frac{i2\\pi}{3}\\right) \\right] $$\n$$ = i \\left[ a - \\frac{a}{2}\\left(\\exp\\left(\\frac{i2\\pi}{3}\\right) + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{i2\\pi}{3}\\right)\\right) \\right] = i \\left[ a - a\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\right) \\right] = i \\left[ a - a\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\right] = i\\frac{3a}{2} $$\nSubstituting these back into the expansion for $h(\\mathbf{K}+\\mathbf{q})$:\n$$ h(\\mathbf{q}) \\equiv h(\\mathbf{K}+\\mathbf{q}) \\approx q_x\\left(-\\frac{3a}{2}\\right) + q_y\\left(i\\frac{3a}{2}\\right) = -\\frac{3a}{2}(q_x - iq_y) $$\nThe low-energy dispersion is then:\n$$ E(\\mathbf{q}) = \\pm t |h(\\mathbf{q})| \\approx \\pm t \\left|-\\frac{3a}{2}(q_x - iq_y)\\right| = \\pm t \\frac{3a}{2} \\sqrt{q_x^2 + q_y^2} = \\pm \\frac{3ta}{2} |\\mathbf{q}| $$\nThis dispersion is linear in the magnitude of the momentum deviation $|\\mathbf{q}|$ and is isotropic (depends only on $|\\mathbf{q}|$, not its direction).

It is a standard, formalizable problem in condensed matter physics and electrical engineering. The setup is consistent, complete, and physically realistic within the context of a simplified model.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nThe total two-terminal resistance, denoted as $R_{T}$, is the sum of the resistances of the components connected in series between the two measurement probes. The current path consists of the first metal-semiconductor contact, the semiconductor channel itself, and the second metal-semiconductor contact. Based on the provided assumption that series elements add linearly, the total resistance can be modeled as a simple series circuit.\n\nThe components are:\n1.  The resistance of the first contact: $R_{c}$\n2.  The resistance of the semiconductor channel: $R_{ch}$\n3.  The resistance of the second contact: $R_{c}$\n\nThe total resistance $R_{T}$ is therefore the sum of these three components:\n$$R_{T} = R_{c} + R_{ch} + R_{c} = 2R_{c} + R_{ch}$$\n\nThe next step is to determine the resistance of the semiconductor channel, $R_{ch}$. According to the fundamental definition of resistance, for a conductor with uniform resistivity $\\rho$, length $\\ell$, and constant cross-sectional area $A$, the resistance is given by:\n$$R = \\rho \\frac{\\ell}{A}$$\n\nFor the rectangular semiconductor channel described in the problem, the length of the current path is $L$, and the cross-sectional area through which the current flows is the product of the channel width $W$ and its physical thickness $t$.\nThus, for the channel resistance $R_{ch}$:\n-   Length $\\ell = L$\n-   Cross-sectional area $A = W \\cdot t$\n\nSubstituting these into the resistance formula gives:\n$$R_{ch} = \\rho \\frac{L}{W t}$$\n\nThe problem requires the introduction of the sheet resistance, $R_{sh}$. Sheet resistance is a property of a thin film of uniform thickness and is defined as the bulk resistivity $\\rho$ divided by the film thickness $t$:\n$$R_{sh} = \\frac{\\rho}{t}$$\nThe units of sheet resistance are ohms, but it is often expressed as ohms per square ($\\Omega/\\Box$) to emphasize its nature as the resistance of a square sheet of the material, measured between opposite sides.\n\nNow, we can express the channel resistance $R_{ch}$ in terms of the sheet resistance $R_{sh}$. We can rewrite the expression for $R_{ch}$ by grouping $\\rho$ and $t$:\n$$R_{ch} = \\left(\\frac{\\rho}{t}\\right) \\frac{L}{W}$$\nBy substituting the definition of $R_{sh}$ into this equation, we get:\n$$R_{ch} = R_{sh} \\frac{L}{W}$$\nHere, the dimensionless ratio $\\frac{L}{W}$ represents the number of \"squares\" of material that compose the rectangular channel.\n\nFinally, we substitute this expression for $R_{ch}$ back into the equation for the total resistance $R_{T}$:\n$$R_{T} = 2R_{c} + R_{sh} \\frac{L}{W}$$\n\nThis expression represents the total two-terminal resistance. It is an explicit linear function of the channel length $L$, as requested. If we write $R_{T}$ as a function of $L$, we have $R_{T}(L) = (\\frac{R_{sh}}{W})L + 2R_{c}$, which is of the form $y = mx+b$. The slope is $m = \\frac{R_{sh}}{W}$ and the y-intercept is the total contact resistance, $2R_{c}$. The expression is in terms of the required parameters: $R_{c}$, $R_{sh}$, $L$, and $W$.",

It is scientifically grounded in established statistical physics models of device variability, is well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution, and is expressed in objective, formal language. The problem is directly relevant to the specified domain of process modeling for emerging memory technologies.\n\nThe solution proceeds in two parts. First, a theoretical derivation from first principles establishes why the set voltage, $V_{\\text{set}}$, modeled as a product of many independent random factors, is expected to follow a log-normal distribution. Second, an algorithm is designed based on this theoretical foundation to estimate the parameters of the distribution from experimental data.\n\n**Part 1: First-Principles Derivation of the Log-Normal Distribution**\n\nThe problem posits that the set voltage, $V_{\\text{set}}$, is a positive random variable resulting from a multiplicative process involving $N$ independent, positive random factors, $\\{X_i\\}_{i=1}^N$. This physical picture corresponds to phenomena like electron transport through a series of fluctuating potential barriers or the formation of a conductive filament through a medium with randomly distributed defects.

This is a critical step because the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), a cornerstone of statistical theory, applies to sums of random variables, not products. Let $Y = \\ln(V_{\\text{set}})$.\n$$\nY = \\ln\\left(C \\prod_{i=1}^N X_i\\right) = \\ln(C) + \\ln\\left(\\prod_{i=1}^N X_i\\right)\n$$\nUsing the property of logarithms that $\\ln(ab) = \\ln(a) + \\ln(b)$, the product becomes a sum:\n$$\nY = \\ln(C) + \\sum_{i=1}^N \\ln(X_i)\n$$\nLet us define a new set of random variables $Y_i = \\ln(X_i)$. Since the $X_i$ are independent, the $Y_i$ are also independent random variables. The equation for $Y$ becomes:\n$$\nY = \\ln(C) + \\sum_{i=1}^N Y_i\n$$\nThe problem states that this conclusion should hold under \"mild conditions\".

The CLT states that the sum of a large number of independent random variables will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the underlying distribution of the individual variables, provided their variance is finite.\n\nLet us assume the random variables $\\{Y_i\\}_{i=1}^N$ are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) with a finite mean $E[Y_i] = \\mu_Y$ and a finite variance $Var(Y_i) = \\sigma_Y^2$.

The theorem states that the standardized sum converges in distribution to a standard normal distribution:\n$$\n\\frac{S_N - E[S_N]}{\\sqrt{Var(S_N)}} \\xrightarrow{d} \\mathcal{N}(0, 1) \\quad \\text{as } N \\to \\infty\n$$\nwhere $E[S_N] = \\sum_{i=1}^N E[Y_i] = N\\mu_Y$ and, due to independence, $Var(S_N) = \\sum_{i=1}^N Var(Y_i) = N\\sigma_Y^2$. This implies that for large $N$, the sum $S_N$ is approximately normally distributed with mean $N\\mu_Y$ and variance $N\\sigma_Y^2$, i.e., $S_N \\sim \\mathcal{N}(N\\mu_Y, N\\sigma_Y^2)$.\n\nThe random variable $Y = \\ln(V_{\\text{set}})$ is a linear transformation of $S_N$: $Y = S_N + \\ln(C)$. A linear transformation of a normally distributed variable is also normally distributed. The mean of $Y$ is $E[Y] = E[S_N] + \\ln(C) = N\\mu_Y + \\ln(C)$, and its variance is $Var(Y) = Var(S_N) = N\\sigma_Y^2$.\n\nLet us define the parameters of the resulting normal distribution for $Y$ as $\\mu$ and $\\sigma^2$:\n$$\n\\mu = E[Y] = N\\mu_Y + \\ln(C)\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma^2 = Var(Y) = N\\sigma_Y^2\n$$\nThus, for large $N$, the logarithm of the set voltage, $Y = \\ln(V_{\\text{set}})$, follows a normal distribution, $Y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$.\n\nBy definition, a positive random variable whose logarithm is normally distributed is said to have a log-normal distribution. Therefore, under the assumption of a large number of independent multiplicative factors with well-defined statistics, $V_{\\text{set}}$ is expected to be log-normally distributed. The \"mild conditions\" are met if the individual logarithmic factors $Y_i$ have finite variance. The i.i.d. assumption can be relaxed if the variables satisfy more general conditions like the Lindeberg or Lyapunov conditions for the CLT.\n\n**Part 2: Algorithmic Design for Parameter Estimation**\n\nThe derivation above provides the statistical model needed to analyze the provided data, which consists of pairs $(v_i, p_i)$ of voltage samples and their corresponding cumulative probabilities. We seek to estimate the parameters $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$ of the normal distribution governing $Y = \\ln(V_{\\text{set}})$.\n\nThe cumulative distribution function (CDF) of $V_{\\text{set}}$ at a voltage $v$ is given by:\n$$\np = P(V_{\\text{set}} \\le v) = P(\\ln(V_{\\text{set}}) \\le \\ln(v)) = P(Y \\le \\ln(v))\n$$\nSince $Y \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$, its CDF, denoted $F_Y(y)$, is:\n$$\nF_Y(y) = P(Y \\le y) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{y-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $\\Phi(z)$ is the CDF of the standard normal distribution $\\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$. Substituting $y = \\ln(v)$, we get the relationship for our data points:\n$$\np_i = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\ln(v_i)-\\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)\n$$\nTo estimate $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$, we must linearize this equation. This is achieved by applying the inverse standard normal CDF, $\\Phi^{-1}(p)$, also known as the quantile function or probit function, to both sides:\n$$\n\\Phi^{-1}(p_i) = \\frac{\\ln(v_i)-\\mu}{\\sigma}\n$$\nRearranging this equation yields a linear relationship:\n$$\n\\ln(v_i) = \\sigma \\cdot \\Phi^{-1}(p_i) + \\mu\n$$\nThis equation has the form of a straight line, $y' = m x' + c$, where:\n- The dependent variable is $y'_i = \\ln(v_i)$.\n- The independent variable is $x'_i = \\Phi^{-1}(p_i)$.\n- The slope is $m = \\sigma$.\n- The y-intercept is $c = \\mu$.\n\nThis suggests the following algorithm for parameter estimation:\n1.  Transform the input data $(v_i, p_i)$. For each data point, compute $y'_i = \\ln(v_i)$ and $x'_i = \\Phi^{-1}(p_i)$.\n2.  Perform a simple linear regression of $y'_{i}$ on $x'_{i}$ to find the best-fit slope, $\\hat{\\sigma}$, and intercept, $\\hat{\\mu}$. These are the estimates for the parameters of the underlying normal distribution.\n3.  Compute the required output metrics from the estimated parameters $\\hat{\\mu}$ and $\\hat{\\sigma}$.\n\n**Calculation of Output Metrics:**\n\n- **Predicted Median Set Voltage ($\\tilde{V}_{50}$):** The median of the distribution corresponds to a cumulative probability of $p=0.5$. The corresponding quantile is $\\Phi^{-1}(0.5) = 0$. Substituting this into the linear equation gives the logarithm of the median voltage:\n  $$\n  \\ln(\\tilde{V}_{50}) = \\hat{\\sigma} \\cdot 0 + \\hat{\\mu} = \\hat{\\mu}\n  $$\n  Therefore, the median voltage is estimated as:\n  $$\n  \\tilde{V}_{50} = e^{\\hat{\\mu}}\n  $$\n\n- **Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) of the CDF fit:** The RMSE quantifies the goodness of fit between the empirical probabilities $p_i$ and the probabilities predicted by the fitted model, $\\hat{p}_i$. The predicted probability for each measured voltage $v_i$ is calculated using the estimated parameters:\n  $$\n  \\hat{p}_i = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{\\ln(v_i)-\\hat{\\mu}}{\\hat{\\sigma}}\\right)\n  $$\n  The RMSE is then computed as the square root of the mean of the squared differences:\n  $$\n  \\mathrm{RMS} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (p_i - \\hat{p}_i)^2}\n  $$\nwhere $n$ is the number of data points in the sample. This procedure will be implemented for each test case provided.",
