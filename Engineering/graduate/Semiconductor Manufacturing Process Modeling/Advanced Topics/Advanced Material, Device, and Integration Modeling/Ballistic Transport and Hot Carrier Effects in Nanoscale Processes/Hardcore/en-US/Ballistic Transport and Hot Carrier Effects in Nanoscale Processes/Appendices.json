Assume a single transverse mode participates in transport across the relevant energy window. Scattering inside the channel is elastic and spatially uniform with an energy-independent mean free path $\\lambda$, and contacts are ideal thermal reservoirs. Let the channel length be $L$. Define the ballisticity factor $B$ as the ratio of the actual low-field current to the ballistic low-field current under identical carrier supply conditions.\n\nStarting from the Landauer transport formalism and the steady-state Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE) in the relaxation-time approximation, and under the assumptions stated above, derive a closed-form expression for $B$ in terms of $L$ and $\\lambda$.

            "solution": "The ballisticity factor $B$ is defined as the ratio of the actual current $I_{\\text{actual}}$ to the ideal ballistic current $I_{\\text{ballistic}}$:\n$$B = \\frac{I_{\\text{actual}}}{I_{\\text{ballistic}}}$$\nIn the linear-response regime, the current $I$ is given by $I = GV$, where $G$ is the conductance and $V$ is the small applied voltage. According to the Landauer formalism, for a one-dimensional conductor with a single transverse mode exhibiting spin degeneracy, the conductance is directly proportional to the transmission probability $T$ of the channel:\n$$G = \\frac{2e^2}{h} T$$\nHere, $e$ is the elementary charge, and $h$ is Planck's constant. The factor of $2$ accounts for spin.\n\nUsing this relation, we can express the actual and ballistic currents as:\n$$I_{\\text{actual}} = G_{\\text{actual}} V = \\left(\\frac{2e^2}{h} T_{\\text{actual}}\\right) V$$\n$$I_{\\text{ballistic}} = G_{\\text{ballistic}} V = \\left(\\frac{2e^2}{h} T_{\\text{ballistic}}\\right) V$$\nwhere $T_{\\text{actual}}$ is the transmission probability in the presence of scattering, and $T_{\\text{ballistic}}$ is the transmission probability for a perfect, scatter-free channel. By definition, a ballistic channel has perfect transmission, so $T_{\\text{ballistic}} = 1$.\n\nSubstituting these into the definition of $B$:\n$$B = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{2e^2}{h} T_{\\text{actual}}\\right) V}{\\left(\\frac{2e^2}{h} T_{\\text{ballistic}}\\right) V} = \\frac{T_{\\text{actual}}}{T_{\\text{ballistic}}} = \\frac{T_{\\text{actual}}}{1} = T_{\\text{actual}}$$\nThus, the ballisticity factor is identical to the transmission probability of the channel, which we will henceforth denote as $T$. The problem reduces to finding an expression for $T$ in terms of the channel length $L$ and the mean free path $\\lambda$.\n\nWe can relate the quantum mechanical transmission probability $T$ to the semi-classical notion of resistance, which emerges from the Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE). The total two-terminal resistance $R_{\\text{total}}$ of the device is the inverse of its conductance:\n$$R_{\\text{total}} = \\frac{1}{G} = \\frac{h}{2e^2 T}$$\nFrom a semi-classical perspective, the total resistance of a conductor with ideal contacts is the sum of the contact resistance and the resistance of the channel itself. This series addition is a key insight that bridges the Landauer and BTE pictures.\n$$R_{\\text{total}} = R_{\\text{contact}} + R_{\\text{channel}}$$\nThe term $R_{\\text{contact}}$ is the fundamental quantum resistance associated with the finite number of conducting modes connecting the channel to the reservoirs. For a single-mode ballistic conductor ($T=1$), this is the only resistance, also known as the Sharvin resistance:\n$$R_{\\text{contact}} = \\frac{h}{2e^2}$$\nThe term $R_{\\text{channel}}$ represents the additional resistance due to scattering within the channel of length $L$. For a one-dimensional diffusive conductor, this resistance is directly proportional to the channel length $L$ and inversely proportional to the mean free path $\\lambda$. The standard result is:\n$$R_{\\text{channel}} = R_{\\text{contact}} \\left(\\frac{L}{\\lambda}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{h}{2e^2}\\right) \\frac{L}{\\lambda}$$\nThis formula reflects that for each segment of length $\\lambda$, a quantum of resistance is added to the total.\n\nBy equating the Landauer expression for the total resistance with the semi-classical series sum:\n$$\\frac{h}{2e^2 T} = R_{\\text{contact}} + R_{\\text{channel}} = \\frac{h}{2e^2} + \\left(\\frac{h}{2e^2}\\right) \\frac{L}{\\lambda}$$\nWe can cancel the common factor of $\\frac{h}{2e^2}$:\n$$\\frac{1}{T} = 1 + \\frac{L}{\\lambda}$$\nSolving for $T$ gives the desired expression:\n$$T = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{L}{\\lambda}} = \\frac{\\lambda}{\\lambda + L}$$\nSince we established that $B = T$, the closed-form expression for the ballisticity factor is:\n$$B(L, \\lambda) = \\frac{\\lambda}{L + \\lambda}$$\n\nNow, we evaluate $B$ for the given numerical values: $L=20\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ and $\\lambda=50\\ \\mathrm{nm}$.\n$$B = \\frac{50}{20 + 50} = \\frac{50}{70} = \\frac{5}{7}$$\nConverting this fraction to a decimal and rounding to four significant figures:\n$$B \\approx 0.7142857... \\approx 0.7143$$\n\nThe physical meaning of this ballisticity factor $B \\approx 0.7143$ is that it represents the transmission probability of the channel. For an electron injected into the channel from one contact, there is a $71.43\\%$ probability that it will successfully traverse the entire length $L$ and exit into the other contact without being back-scattered by an elastic scattering event. Because the channel length ($L=20\\ \\mathrm{nm}$) is shorter than the mean free path ($\\lambda=50\\ \\mathrm{nm}$), transport is in the quasi-ballistic regime, where scattering is present but does not fully dominate the transport process.",

The channel length is given as $L=15\\ \\mathrm{nm}$. We have calculated the mean free path to be $\\lambda \\approx 37.4\\ \\mathrm{nm}$.\n\nA critical comparison shows that $L < \\lambda$. The derivation of the steady-state drift velocity $v_d$ relies on the drift-diffusion model, which assumes that an electron undergoes many scattering events as it traverses the channel. These frequent collisions are what establish a steady-state condition where the acceleration due to the electric field is balanced by the friction-like drag from scattering. This picture is valid only when $L \\gg \\lambda$.\n\nIn the present case, since $L \\lesssim \\lambda$, a significant portion of electrons can travel from the source to the drain without undergoing any momentum-relaxing scattering events. This regime is known as ballistic or quasi-ballistic transport. In this regime, the fundamental assumption of the relaxation-time approximation—that collisions are frequent enough to maintain a near-equilibrium distribution—is violated. Electrons do not reach a constant steady-state drift velocity. Instead, they continuously accelerate under the influence of the electric field across the channel. Their final velocity upon reaching the drain would be limited by the potential drop across the channel, not by scattering. Therefore, the expression $v_{d} = q\\tau E/m^{\\ast}$ is not applicable to describe carrier transport in this $15\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ channel. A more advanced transport formalism, such as a full numerical solution of the BTE or a quantum transport model (e.g., NEGF), would be necessary to accurately capture the physics of ballistic transport and related hot carrier effects.",

We begin from the fundamental definition of current as charge flux, as understood within the virtual-source model of a transistor.\n\nAt the virtual source, which is the point of maximum potential energy barrier for carriers in the channel, we consider two populations of carriers (electrons, for an n-channel device).

The problem specifies to assume negligible backscattering, which means $r=0$. Under this condition, the general current equation simplifies to:\n$$I = W Q_{vs} v_{inj}$$\nWe solve for $v_{inj}$:\n$$v_{inj} = \\frac{I}{W Q_{vs}}$$\nWe substitute the given values and our calculated $Q_{vs}$. It is critical to use consistent SI units.\n$I = 8.38914\\,\\mathrm{mA} = 8.38914 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{A}$\n$W = 10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 10 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{m} = 1 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}$\n$Q_{vs} \\approx 0.010486425\\,\\mathrm{C/m^2}$\n$$v_{inj} = \\frac{8.38914 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{A}}{(1 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m}) \\times (0.010486425\\,\\mathrm{C/m^2})}$$\n$$v_{inj} = \\frac{8.38914 \\times 10^{-3}}{1.0486425 \\times 10^{-7}}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$$\n$$v_{inj} = \\frac{8.38914}{1.0486425} \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$$\n$$v_{inj} = 80000.0\\,\\mathrm{m/s} = 8.00000 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$$\nThe question requires the final answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$v_{inj} = 8.000 \\times 10^{4}\\,\\mathrm{m/s}$$",
            "answer": "$$\\boxed{8.000 \\times 10^{4}}$$"
