The problem is scientifically grounded in the established Poisson model for defect-limited yield, is well-posed with all necessary parameters provided, and is formulated objectively. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem states that random defects are modeled as a homogeneous spatial Poisson point process. For such a process, the number of defects, $N$, occurring in a fixed area $A$ follows a Poisson distribution with a probability mass function given by:\n$$P(N=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^{k} \\exp(-\\lambda)}{k!}$$\nwhere $k$ is the number of defects (a non-negative integer) and $\\lambda$ is the average number of defects in the area $A$. The parameter $\\lambda$ is calculated as the product of the defect density, $D$, and the area, $A$:\n$$\\lambda = A D$$\n\nA die is considered functionally good if and only if it contains zero defects. Therefore, the functional yield, $Y$, is the probability of finding $k=0$ defects in the die area $A$.\n$$Y = P(N=0) = \\frac{\\lambda^{0} \\exp(-\\lambda)}{0!} = \\frac{1 \\cdot \\exp(-\\lambda)}{1} = \\exp(-\\lambda)$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\lambda$, we obtain the Poisson yield model formula:\n$$Y(D) = \\exp(-A D)$$\n\nThe problem provides the following data:\n- Die area: $A = 100\\ \\text{mm}^{2}$\n- Baseline defect density: $D_{0} = 0.2\\ \\text{defects}/\\text{cm}^{2}$\n\nTo calculate the mean number of defects $\\lambda_0$, the units of area and defect density must be consistent.

            "introduction": "While the Poisson model provides a valuable first approximation, real-world manufacturing processes often exhibit defect clustering, where defects tend to group together rather than being uniformly distributed. To capture this phenomenon, we introduce a more sophisticated approach by modeling the defect density itself as a random variable, typically following a Gamma distribution, which leads to the Negative Binomial yield model. This practice problem  challenges you to directly compare the predictions of the Poisson and Negative Binomial models, illustrating how accounting for clustering leads to more optimistic, and often more accurate, yield forecasts.",

            "problem": "A rectangular die in an Integrated Circuit (IC) fabrication line is considered functionally good if it contains zero catastrophic defects within its active area. Let the die area be $A=50\\ \\text{mm}^2$, and let the nominal defect density be $D_0=0.1\\ \\text{defects}/\\text{cm}^2$. Assume defects land independently and uniformly in space when conditioned on a local defect intensity, and define the functional yield as the probability that the die has zero catastrophic defects.\n\nStarting from the following foundational modeling assumptions:\n- Under spatial independence with a homogeneous rate, the number of defects $N$ in area $A$ conditioned on rate $D$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean $D\\,A$, so $P(N=0\\mid D)=\\exp(-D\\,A)$.\n- To capture defect clustering, suppose the local defect density $D$ varies across dies and follows a Gamma distribution with shape parameter $\\alpha0$ and rate parameter $\\beta0$, with probability density function $f_D(d)=\\frac{\\beta^{\\alpha}}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)}\\,d^{\\alpha-1}\\exp(-\\beta d)$ for $d\\geq 0$.

This model assumes a constant defect density $D_0$. The mean number of defects per die is $\\lambda_0 = D_0 A$. The yield is the probability of having zero defects:\n$$Y_{\\text{P}} = \\exp(-D_0 A)$$\nWe compute the mean number of defects:\n$$\\lambda_0 = D_0 A = (0.1\\ \\text{defects}/\\text{cm}^2) \\times (0.5\\ \\text{cm}^2) = 0.05$$\nThe Poisson yield is therefore:\n$$Y_{\\text{P}} = \\exp(-0.05)$$\n\nNow, we derive the yield for the **Negative Binomial model** ($Y_{\\text{NB}}$), which accounts for defect clustering by treating the defect density $D$ as a Gamma-distributed random variable.

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated and found to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in standard semiconductor yield modeling theory, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively formulated.\n\nThe solution proceeds first by deriving the expressions for functional yield and test yield, then deriving the expression for Defects Per Million (DPM), and finally by performing the numerical calculation.\n\nLet $j$ denote a defect class, where $j \\in \\{\\text{bridge}, \\text{open}\\}$.\nThe number of defects of class $j$ on a die, $N_j$, is a Poisson random variable with mean $\\lambda_j = D_j A_j$.

For each defect class $j$, a defect is detected with probability $c_j$. This scenario corresponds to the \"thinning\" of a Poisson process. If a random variable $N$ follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda$, and each event is independently selected with probability $p$, then the number of selected events, $N_{\\text{selected}}$, follows a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda p$.\n\nLet $N_{j,d}$ be the number of detected defects of class $j$, and $N_{j,u}$ be the number of undetected defects of class $j$.\nFrom the thinning property of the Poisson distribution:\n$N_{j,d}$ is Poisson with mean $\\lambda_{j,d} = \\lambda_j c_j$.\n$N_{j,u}$ is Poisson with mean $\\lambda_{j,u} = \\lambda_j (1 - c_j)$.\nFurthermore, $N_{j,d}$ and $N_{j,u}$ are independent random variables.\n\nThe total number of detected defects on a die is $N_{\\text{detected}} = N_{\\text{bridge},d} + N_{\\text{open},d}$. Since defect classes are independent, $N_{\\text{bridge},d}$ and $N_{\\text{open},d}$ are independent Poisson variables. Their sum is also a Poisson random variable with mean:\n$\\lambda_{\\text{detected}} = \\lambda_{\\text{bridge},d} + \\lambda_{\\text{open},d} = \\lambda_{\\text{bridge}} c_{\\text{bridge}} + \\lambda_{\\text{open}} c_{\\text{open}}$\n\nThe test yield, $Y_{\\text{t}}$, is the probability that a die passes the test, which means it has zero detected defects.\n$$Y_{\\text{t}} = P(N_{\\text{detected}} = 0) = \\exp(-\\lambda_{\\text{detected}})$$\n$$Y_{\\text{t}} = \\exp(-(\\lambda_{\\text{bridge}} c_{\\text{bridge}} + \\lambda_{\\text{open}} c_{\\text{open}}))$$\n\nTo expose why $c_j  1$ causes $Y_{\\text{t}}$ to differ from $Y_{\\text{f}}$, we compare their expressions. Since $c_j  1$ for both defect classes, it follows that $c_j \\lambda_j  \\lambda_j$.

This directly addresses the first task.\n\nNow we compute the Defects Per Million (DPM). DPM is the expected number of defective parts per million shipped parts. A part is shipped if it passes the test. A shipped part is defective if it passed the test but is functionally faulty.\nThe probability of this event is the Field Fail Rate (FFR):\n$$FFR = P(\\text{functionally bad} | \\text{passes test}) = \\frac{P(\\text{functionally bad and passes test})}{P(\\text{passes test})}$$\nThe denominator is the test yield, $Y_{\\text{t}}$.\nThe event in the numerator is that a die has one or more defects ($N_{\\text{total}} > 0$) but has zero detected defects ($N_{\\text{detected}} = 0$). This is equivalent to the event $\\{N_{\\text{detected}} = 0\\} \\setminus \\{N_{\\text{total}} = 0\\}$.\nThe probability of the numerator is $P(N_{\\text{detected}} = 0) - P(N_{\\text{total}} = 0) = Y_{\\text{t}} - Y_{\\text{f}}$.\nTherefore,\n$$FFR = \\frac{Y_{\\text{t}} - Y_{\\text{f}}}{Y_{\\text{t}}} = 1 - \\frac{Y_{\\text{f}}}{Y_{\\text{t}}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the yields:\n$$FFR = 1 - \\frac{\\exp(-(\\lambda_{\\text{bridge}} + \\lambda_{\\text{open}}))}{\\exp(-(\\lambda_{\\text{bridge}} c_{\\text{bridge}} + \\lambda_{\\text{open}} c_{\\text{open}}))} = 1 - \\exp(-(\\lambda_{\\text{bridge}}(1-c_{\\text{bridge}}) + \\lambda_{\\text{open}}(1-c_{\\text{open}})))$$\nThe term in the exponent is the mean of the total number of undetected defects, $\\lambda_{\\text{undetected}} = \\lambda_{\\text{bridge},u} + \\lambda_{\\text{open},u}$. So, $FFR = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_{\\text{undetected}})$.\n\nFinally, $DPM = FFR \\times 10^6$.\n\nWe now substitute the given numerical values:\n$D_{\\text{bridge}} = 0.06$, $A_{\\text{bridge}} = 0.20$, $c_{\\text{bridge}} = 0.95$.\n$D_{\\text{open}} = 0.04$, $A_{\\text{open}} = 0.24$, $c_{\\text{open}} = 0.88$.\n\nFirst, calculate the mean defect counts, $\\lambda_j$:\n$\\lambda_{\\text{bridge}} = D_{\\text{bridge}} A_{\\text{bridge}} = 0.06 \\times 0.20 = 0.012$.\n$\\lambda_{\\text{open}} = D_{\\text{open}} A_{\\text{open}} = 0.04 \\times 0.24 = 0.0096$.\n\nNext, calculate the mean of the total number of undetected defects, $\\lambda_{\\text{undetected}}$:\n$\\lambda_{\\text{undetected}} = \\lambda_{\\text{bridge}}(1-c_{\\text{bridge}}) + \\lambda_{\\text{open}}(1-c_{\\text{open}})$\n$\\lambda_{\\text{undetected}} = 0.012 \\times (1 - 0.95) + 0.0096 \\times (1 - 0.88)$\n$\\lambda_{\\text{undetected}} = 0.012 \\times 0.05 + 0.0096 \\times 0.12$\n$\\lambda_{\\text{undetected}} = 0.0006 + 0.001152 = 0.001752$.\n\nNow, calculate the Field Fail Rate:\n$FFR = 1 - \\exp(-\\lambda_{\\text{undetected}}) = 1 - \\exp(-0.001752)$\n$FFR \\approx 1 - 0.99824953 = 0.00175047$.\n\nFinally, calculate DPM:\n$DPM = FFR \\times 10^6 = 0.00175047 \\times 10^6 = 1750.47$.\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to three significant figures.\n$1750.47$ rounded to three significant figures is $1750$.",
