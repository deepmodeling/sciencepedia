When a film and its substrate, possessing different coefficients of thermal expansion ($\\alpha$), are cooled from a high deposition temperature, they attempt to contract by different amounts. This exercise provides a foundational practice in deriving the resulting thermal stress from first principles, applying concepts of strain compatibility and Hooke's law for the crucial case of a thin film on a much thicker substrate. Mastering this calculation  is the first essential step in analyzing and controlling stress in nearly all multilayered devices.",

            "problem": "A thin, linear elastic, isotropic film is deposited on a much thicker, linear elastic, isotropic substrate in a semiconductor wafer stack. The film has Young’s modulus $E_{f}$, Poisson’s ratio $\\nu_{f}$, and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) $\\alpha_{f}$. The substrate has CTE $\\alpha_{s}$. Assume perfect bonding, no plasticity, no creep, and that the substrate is sufficiently thick that wafer curvature can be neglected and the in-plane strain of the film equals the in-plane strain of the free substrate. The film is deposited stress-free at temperature $T_{1}$ and then the wafer is cooled to temperature $T_{2}$, with all properties taken as temperature independent over this interval.\n\nStarting from the linear thermoelastic kinematics and Hooke’s law, derive from first principles an expression for the equi-biaxial residual in-plane stress in the film at $T_{2}$ as a signed quantity (take tension as positive). Then evaluate it for the following data:\n- $E_{f} = 200\\,\\mathrm{GPa}$,\n- $\\nu_{f} = 0.25$,\n- $\\alpha_{f} = 3.2 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$,\n- $\\alpha_{s} = 2.6 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$,\n- $T_{1} = 400\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$,\n- $T_{2} = 25\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$.\n\nReport the final stress value in $\\mathrm{MPa}$, using the sign convention above, and round your final numerical answer to three significant figures.

            "solution": "The problem is assessed to be valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of continuum mechanics and thermoelasticity, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is expressed in objective, formal language. We may therefore proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem asks for the equi-biaxial residual in-plane stress in a thin film deposited on a thick substrate after a change in temperature. We will derive this from first principles using the theory of linear thermoelasticity.\n\nLet us establish a coordinate system where the $x-y$ plane is parallel to the film-substrate interface and the $z$-axis is perpendicular to it. The in-plane stresses and strains are those in the $x$ and $y$ directions.\n\nThe total strain, $\\epsilon_{ij}$, in a linear thermoelastic material is the superposition of the mechanical (elastic) strain, $\\epsilon_{ij}^{e}$, and the thermal strain, $\\epsilon_{ij}^{th}$:\n$$ \\epsilon_{ij} = \\epsilon_{ij}^{e} + \\epsilon_{ij}^{th} $$\nFor an isotropic material subjected to a uniform temperature change $\\Delta T = T_{2} - T_{1}$, the thermal strain is isotropic and given by:\n$$ \\epsilon_{ij}^{th} = \\alpha \\Delta T \\delta_{ij} $$\nwhere $\\alpha$ is the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) and $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta. This means the thermal strains are $\\epsilon_{xx}^{th} = \\epsilon_{yy}^{th} = \\epsilon_{zz}^{th} = \\alpha \\Delta T$.\n\nThe problem states that the substrate is much thicker than the film. This implies that the substrate's dimensional changes are unaffected by the thin film. The substrate is assumed to be free to expand or contract. Therefore, the total in-plane strain of the substrate is purely its thermal strain, $\\epsilon_{s, \\parallel} = \\alpha_s \\Delta T$.\n\nA key condition is that of perfect bonding and the assumption that the \"in-plane strain of the film equals the in-plane strain of the free substrate\". This means the total in-plane strain of the film, $\\epsilon_{f, \\parallel}$, is constrained to be equal to the substrate's strain:\n$$ \\epsilon_{xx, f} = \\epsilon_{yy, f} = \\epsilon_{s, \\parallel} = \\alpha_s \\Delta T $$\n\nThe film itself would, if unconstrained, experience a thermal strain of $\\epsilon_{f, \\text{thermal}} = \\alpha_f \\Delta T$. The difference between the strain imposed by the substrate and the film's natural thermal strain gives rise to an elastic strain in the film. The in-plane elastic strain in the film, $\\epsilon_{xx, f}^{e}$, is:\n$$ \\epsilon_{xx, f}^{e} = \\epsilon_{xx, f} - \\epsilon_{xx, f}^{th} = \\alpha_s \\Delta T - \\alpha_f \\Delta T = (\\alpha_s - \\alpha_f) \\Delta T $$\nDue to the symmetry of the problem (isotropic materials and uniform temperature change), the in-plane strains and stresses are equi-biaxial:\n$$ \\epsilon_{xx, f}^{e} = \\epsilon_{yy, f}^{e} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{xx, f} = \\sigma_{yy, f} = \\sigma_f $$\n\nSince the film is thin, it is assumed to be in a state of plane stress, which means the stress component normal to the film surface is zero: $\\sigma_{zz, f} = 0$.\n\nNow we apply Hooke's law for an isotropic, linear elastic material, which relates stress to elastic strain. The strain-stress relations are:\n$$ \\epsilon_{xx, f}^{e} = \\frac{1}{E_f} [ \\sigma_{xx, f} - \\nu_f (\\sigma_{yy, f} + \\sigma_{zz, f}) ] $$\n$$ \\epsilon_{yy, f}^{e} = \\frac{1}{E_f} [ \\sigma_{yy, f} - \\nu_f (\\sigma_{xx, f} + \\sigma_{zz, f}) ] $$\nSubstituting the equi-biaxial stress condition ($\\sigma_{xx, f} = \\sigma_{yy, f} = \\sigma_f$) and the plane stress condition ($\\sigma_{zz, f} = 0$) into the equation for $\\epsilon_{xx, f}^{e}$:\n$$ \\epsilon_{xx, f}^{e} = \\frac{1}{E_f} [ \\sigma_f - \\nu_f (\\sigma_f + 0) ] = \\frac{\\sigma_f}{E_f} (1 - \\nu_f) $$\nWe now have two expressions for the in-plane elastic strain in the film, $\\epsilon_{xx, f}^{e}$. Equating them allows us to solve for the stress $\\sigma_f$:\n$$ \\frac{\\sigma_f}{E_f} (1 - \\nu_f) = (\\alpha_s - \\alpha_f) \\Delta T $$\nSolving for $\\sigma_f$:\n$$ \\sigma_f = \\frac{E_f}{1 - \\nu_f} (\\alpha_s - \\alpha_f) \\Delta T $$\nThis is the desired expression for the equi-biaxial residual in-plane stress in the film. The term $M_f = \\frac{E_f}{1 - \\nu_f}$ is known as the biaxial modulus of the film.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression using the provided data:\n- $E_{f} = 200\\,\\mathrm{GPa} = 200 \\times 10^{9}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n- $\\nu_{f} = 0.25$\n- $\\alpha_{f} = 3.2 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n- $\\alpha_{s} = 2.6 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$\n- $T_{1} = 400\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$\n- $T_{2} = 25\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$\n\nThe temperature change is $\\Delta T = T_{2} - T_{1} = 25\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C} - 400\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C} = -375\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$. Since a temperature interval in Celsius is equal to an interval in Kelvin, $\\Delta T = -375\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n\nThe difference in coefficients of thermal expansion is:\n$$ \\alpha_s - \\alpha_f = (2.6 \\times 10^{-6} - 3.2 \\times 10^{-6})\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1} = -0.6 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1} $$\n\nNow, substitute these values into the stress formula:\n$$ \\sigma_f = \\frac{200 \\times 10^9\\,\\mathrm{Pa}}{1 - 0.25} \\times (-0.6 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}) \\times (-375\\,\\mathrm{K}) $$\n$$ \\sigma_f = \\frac{200 \\times 10^9}{0.75} \\times (0.6 \\times 375 \\times 10^{-6})\\,\\mathrm{Pa} $$\n$$ \\sigma_f = (\\frac{800}{3} \\times 10^9) \\times (225 \\times 10^{-6})\\,\\mathrm{Pa} $$\n$$ \\sigma_f = \\frac{800}{3} \\times 225 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa} $$\n$$ \\sigma_f = 800 \\times 75 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa} $$\n$$ \\sigma_f = 60000 \\times 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{Pa} = 60 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{Pa} $$\n$$ \\sigma_f = 60\\,\\mathrm{MPa} $$\n\nThe sign of the stress determines its nature. Here, the calculated stress $\\sigma_f = +60\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$ is positive. According to the problem's convention (tension is positive), the film is in a state of biaxial tension. This result is physically consistent: on cooling ($\\Delta T  0$), the film, having a higher CTE than the substrate ($\\alpha_f  \\alpha_s$), wants to shrink more. The substrate constrains this shrinkage, effectively stretching the film relative to its stress-free state at that temperature, resulting in tensile stress.\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures. A value of $60$ must be written as $60.0$ to reflect this precision.\n\nThe final stress is $60.0\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$.",

            "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and complete. It describes a standard scenario in thin film mechanics, providing all necessary parameters and assumptions for a unique and meaningful solution. The principles of linear thermoelasticity and strain compatibility are appropriate for this context. The provided material properties and process parameters are physically realistic for the silicon nitride/silicon system. Therefore, the problem is valid, and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires a four-part solution: $1$) derivation of the thermal mismatch stress, $2$) calculation of the net residual stress, $3$) analysis of the uncertainty in the result, and $4$) reporting the final numerical value.\n\n**1. Derivation of Thermal Mismatch Stress**\n\nThe thermal mismatch stress, $\\sigma_{\\text{th}}$, arises from the difference in the coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE), $\\alpha$, between the film ($f$) and the substrate ($s$) during the temperature change $\\Delta T = T_{\\text{dep}} - T_{\\text{fin}}$. We assume perfect bonding between the film and the substrate, which enforces strain compatibility at the interface. This means the total in-plane strain in the film, $\\varepsilon_{\\text{total},f}$, must equal the total in-plane strain in the substrate, $\\varepsilon_{\\text{total},s}$, at all times.\n\nThe total strain is the sum of the elastic strain, $\\varepsilon_{\\text{el}}$, and the thermal strain, $\\varepsilon_{\\text{th}}$.\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\text{total}} = \\varepsilon_{\\text{el}} + \\varepsilon_{\\text{th}} $$\nThe thermal strain resulting from a temperature drop $\\Delta T$ is given by $\\varepsilon_{\\text{th}} = -\\alpha \\Delta T$. The strain compatibility condition is thus:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\text{el},f} + \\varepsilon_{\\text{th},f} = \\varepsilon_{\\text{el},s} + \\varepsilon_{\\text{th},s} $$\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\text{el},f} - \\alpha_f \\Delta T = \\varepsilon_{\\text{el},s} - \\alpha_s \\Delta T $$\nThe problem states that the substrate is much thicker than the film ($t_s = 775\\,\\mu\\text{m} \\gg t_f = 120\\,\\text{nm}$), and global bending is negligible. This implies that the thick, unconstrained substrate dictates the system's response. The substrate contracts largely freely, so its elastic strain is approximately zero, $\\varepsilon_{\\text{el},s} \\approx 0$. This simplifies the compatibility equation to an expression for the elastic strain imposed on the film:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\text{el},f} = (\\alpha_f - \\alpha_s) \\Delta T $$\nThis elastic strain generates the thermal stress in the film. The film is in a state of plane stress ($\\sigma_{zz} = 0$) and, due to isotropic in-plane constraints, experiences an equi-biaxial stress state where $\\sigma_{xx} = \\sigma_{yy} = \\sigma_{\\text{th}}$. The linear isotropic thermoelastic constitutive relation for the in-plane strain ($\\varepsilon_{xx} = \\varepsilon_{yy} = \\varepsilon_{\\text{el},f}$) is:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{\\text{el},f} = \\frac{1}{E_f}(\\sigma_{\\text{th}} - \\nu_f \\sigma_{\\text{th}}) = \\frac{1-\\nu_f}{E_f} \\sigma_{\\text{th}} $$\nwhere $E_f$ is the film's Young's modulus and $\\nu_f$ is its Poisson's ratio. Solving for the stress gives:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\text{th}} = \\frac{E_f}{1-\\nu_f} \\varepsilon_{\\text{el},f} $$\nThe term $\\frac{E_f}{1-\\nu_f}$ is the film's biaxial modulus, $M_f$. Substituting the expression for $\\varepsilon_{\\text{el},f}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\text{th}} = M_f (\\alpha_f - \\alpha_s) \\Delta T $$\nThis is the derived expression for the thermal mismatch stress. Tensile stress is positive. If $\\alpha_f  \\alpha_s$, the film attempts to shrink more than the substrate upon cooling. The substrate constrains this shrinkage, pulling on the film and inducing a tensile stress ($\\sigma_{\\text{th}}  0$), consistent with the formula as $\\Delta T  0$.\n\n**2. Calculation of Net Residual Stress**\n\nThe net residual stress, $\\sigma_{\\text{res}}$, at the final temperature $T_{\\text{fin}}$ is the linear superposition of the intrinsic stress, $\\sigma_{\\text{int}}$ (present at the deposition temperature), and the thermal mismatch stress, $\\sigma_{\\text{th}}$, that develops during cooling.\n$$ \\sigma_{\\text{res}} = \\sigma_{\\text{int}} + \\sigma_{\\text{th}} = \\sigma_{\\text{int}} + M_f (\\alpha_f - \\alpha_s) \\Delta T $$\nFirst, we compute the nominal value of the thermal stress component using the provided data:\n- $E_f = 240\\,\\text{GPa} = 240 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{MPa}$\n- $\\nu_f = 0.23$\n- $\\alpha_f = 3.0\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$\n- $\\alpha_s = 2.6\\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}$\n- $\\Delta T = 375\\,\\text{K}$\n\nThe biaxial modulus is:\n$$ M_f = \\frac{240\\,\\text{GPa}}{1 - 0.23} = \\frac{240}{0.77}\\,\\text{GPa} \\approx 311.688\\,\\text{GPa} $$\nThe thermal stress is:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\text{th}} = \\left(\\frac{240 \\times 10^3\\,\\text{MPa}}{0.77}\\right) (3.0 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{K}^{-1} - 2.6 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\text{K}^{-1}) (375\\,\\text{K}) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\text{th}} = \\left(\\frac{240 \\times 10^3}{0.77}\\right) (0.4 \\times 10^{-6}) (375)\\,\\text{MPa} \\approx 46.753\\,\\text{MPa} $$\nThe net residual stress is the sum of the intrinsic stress ($\\sigma_{\\text{int}} = 820\\,\\text{MPa}$) and the thermal stress:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\text{res}} = 820\\,\\text{MPa} + 46.753\\,\\text{MPa} = 866.753\\,\\text{MPa} $$\n\n**3. Uncertainty Analysis**\n\nThe combined standard uncertainty of $\\sigma_{\\text{res}}$, denoted $u(\\sigma_{\\text{res}})$, is estimated using the first-order Taylor series expansion for uncertainty propagation. For independent input variables $x_i$ with standard uncertainties $u(x_i)$, the variance of a function $f(x_1, x_2, \\dots)$ is given by:\n$$ u(f)^2 = \\sum_i \\left( \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i} \\right)^2 u(x_i)^2 $$\nOur function is $\\sigma_{\\text{res}} = \\sigma_{\\text{int}} + \\frac{E_f}{1-\\nu_f}(\\alpha_f - \\alpha_s)\\Delta T$.

The total potential energy change, $\\Delta \\Pi$, associated with the formation of a one-dimensional sinusoidal wrinkle of the form $w(x) = a \\cos(kx)$ is the sum of three contributions: the bending energy of the film, $U_{bend}$; the strain energy stored in the substrate, $U_{sub}$; and the work done by the in-plane compressive stress, $W_{comp}$. The wavenumber is related to the wavelength by $k = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}$.\n\n**1. Derivation of the Preferred Wavelength $\\lambda$**\n\nThe derivation proceeds by formulating the energy terms per unit width over a single wavelength, $\\lambda$.\n\nThe bending energy stored in the film, governed by small-slope plate theory, is:\n$$ U_{bend} = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{\\lambda} D \\left(\\frac{d^2 w}{dx^2}\\right)^2 dx $$\nwhere $D = \\frac{E_{f} h^{3}}{12(1 - \\nu_{f}^{2})}$ is the film's plane-stress bending rigidity. For the assumed deflection $w(x) = a \\cos(kx)$, the second derivative is $\\frac{d^2 w}{dx^2} = -ak^2\\cos(kx)$. Substituting this into the integral:\n$$ U_{bend} = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi/k} D \\left(-ak^2\\cos(kx)\\right)^2 dx = \\frac{1}{2} D a^2 k^4 \\int_{0}^{2\\pi/k} \\cos^2(kx) dx $$\nThe integral evaluates to $\\int_{0}^{2\\pi/k} \\cos^2(kx) dx = \\frac{\\pi}{k}$. Therefore, the bending energy is:\n$$ U_{bend} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} D a^2 k^3 $$\n\nThe strain energy stored in the semi-infinite elastic substrate results from the deformation imposed by the film. For a sinusoidal surface displacement $w(x)$, the restoring pressure exerted by the substrate on the film is a standard result from the theory of elasticity for a half-space: $p_{sub}(x) = \\frac{k \\bar{E}_s}{2} w(x)$, where $\\bar{E}_s = \\frac{E_s}{1-\\nu_s^2}$ is the plane-strain modulus of the substrate. The strain energy stored in the substrate is the work done by this pressure:\n$$ U_{sub} = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{\\lambda} p_{sub}(x) w(x) dx = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi/k} \\left(\\frac{k \\bar{E}_s}{2} w(x)\\right) w(x) dx $$\n$$ U_{sub} = \\frac{k \\bar{E}_s}{4} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi/k} a^2 \\cos^2(kx) dx = \\frac{k \\bar{E}_s}{4} a^2 \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{k}\\right) = \\frac{\\pi}{4} a^2 \\bar{E}_s $$\n\nThe work done by the uniform compressive stress $\\sigma_0$ (where $\\sigma_0  0$ is the magnitude) is negative, as the compressive force $F = \\sigma_0 h$ per unit width does work due to the path shortening associated with wrinkling. The change in length is $\\Delta L = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_0^\\lambda (\\frac{dw}{dx})^2 dx$.\n$$ W_{comp} = -F \\Delta L = -(\\sigma_0 h) \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{\\lambda} \\left(\\frac{dw}{dx}\\right)^2 dx $$\nWith $\\frac{dw}{dx} = -ak\\sin(kx)$, the work term becomes:\n$$ W_{comp} = -\\frac{\\sigma_0 h}{2} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi/k} \\left(-ak\\sin(kx)\\right)^2 dx = -\\frac{\\sigma_0 h a^2 k^2}{2} \\int_{0}^{2\\pi/k} \\sin^2(kx) dx $$\nThe integral evaluates to $\\int_{0}^{2\\pi/k} \\sin^2(kx) dx = \\frac{\\pi}{k}$. Thus:\n$$ W_{comp} = -\\frac{\\sigma_0 h a^2 k^2}{2} \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{k}\\right) = -\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\sigma_0 h a^2 k $$\n\nThe total potential energy change is $\\Delta \\Pi = U_{bend} + U_{sub} + W_{comp}$:\n$$ \\Delta \\Pi = \\frac{\\pi}{2} D a^2 k^3 + \\frac{\\pi}{4} a^2 \\bar{E}_s - \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\sigma_0 h a^2 k $$\nThe system selects the wrinkling mode (wavenumber $k$) that minimizes the critical stress $\\sigma_0$ required for instability. We find $\\sigma_0(k)$ by setting $\\Delta \\Pi = 0$ for a non-trivial amplitude ($a \\neq 0$):\n$$ \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\sigma_0 h a^2 k = \\frac{\\pi}{2} D a^2 k^3 + \\frac{\\pi}{4} a^2 \\bar{E}_s $$\n$$ \\sigma_0(k) = \\frac{D k^2}{h} + \\frac{\\bar{E}_s}{2hk} $$\nTo find the minimum stress, we differentiate $\\sigma_0(k)$ with respect to $k$ and set the result to zero:\n$$ \\frac{d\\sigma_0}{dk} = \\frac{2Dk}{h} - \\frac{\\bar{E}_s}{2hk^2} = 0 \\implies 4Dk^3 = \\bar{E}_s $$\nThis yields the energetically preferred wavenumber, $k_c$:\n$$ k_c = \\left(\\frac{\\bar{E}_s}{4D}\\right)^{1/3} $$\nThe corresponding preferred wavelength is $\\lambda = \\frac{2\\pi}{k_c}$:\n$$ \\lambda = 2\\pi \\left(\\frac{4D}{\\bar{E}_s}\\right)^{1/3} $$\nSubstituting the definitions $D = \\frac{\\bar{E}_f h^3}{12}$ (where $\\bar{E}_f = \\frac{E_f}{1-\\nu_f^2}$) and $\\bar{E}_s = \\frac{E_s}{1-\\nu_s^2}$:\n$$ \\lambda = 2\\pi \\left(\\frac{4 (\\frac{\\bar{E}_f h^3}{12})}{\\bar{E}_s}\\right)^{1/3} = 2\\pi \\left(\\frac{\\bar{E}_f h^3}{3\\bar{E}_s}\\right)^{1/3} = 2\\pi h \\left(\\frac{\\bar{E}_f}{3\\bar{E}_s}\\right)^{1/3} $$\nExpressed in terms of the fundamental material properties, the analytic expression for $\\lambda$ is:\n$$ \\lambda = 2\\pi h \\left(\\frac{E_f(1-\\nu_s^2)}{3E_s(1-\\nu_f^2)}\\right)^{1/3} $$\n\n**2. Numerical Evaluation of $\\lambda$**\n\nUsing the provided parameters:\n- $h = 100 \\,\\text{nm} = 1 \\times 10^{-7} \\,\\text{m}$\n- $E_{f} = 200 \\,\\text{GPa} = 2 \\times 10^{11} \\,\\text{Pa}$\n- $\\nu_{f} = 0.23$\n- $E_{s} = 1.8 \\,\\text{MPa} = 1.8 \\times 10^{6} \\,\\text{Pa}$\n- $\\nu_{s} = 0.49$\n\nFirst, compute the ratio of the plane-strain moduli:\n$$ \\frac{\\bar{E}_f}{\\bar{E}_s} = \\frac{E_f(1-\\nu_s^2)}{E_s(1-\\nu_f^2)} = \\frac{(2 \\times 10^{11})(1 - 0.49^2)}{(1.8 \\times 10^6)(1 - 0.23^2)} = \\frac{(2 \\times 10^{11})(0.7599)}{(1.8 \\times 10^6)(0.9471)} \\approx 89149.6 $$\nNext, substitute this value into the expression for $\\lambda$:\n$$ \\lambda = 2\\pi (1 \\times 10^{-7} \\,\\text{m}) \\left(\\frac{89149.6}{3}\\right)^{1/3} \\approx 2\\pi \\times 10^{-7} \\left(29716.53\\right)^{1/3} $$\n$$ \\lambda \\approx 6.2832 \\times 10^{-7} \\times 30.9753 \\,\\text{m} \\approx 1.9461 \\times 10^{-5} \\,\\text{m} $$\nConverting to micrometers ($\\mu\\text{m}$) by multiplying by $10^6$:\n$$ \\lambda \\approx 19.461 \\,\\mu\\text{m} $$\nRounding to three significant figures as requested gives:\n$$ \\lambda \\approx 19.5 \\,\\mu\\text{m} $$\n\n**3. Derivation and Evaluation of Sensitivity $S$**\n\nThe logarithmic sensitivity $S$ is defined as $S = \\frac{\\partial \\ln \\lambda}{\\partial \\ln E_{s}}$. We begin with the analytic expression for $\\lambda$, isolating the dependence on $E_s$:\n$$ \\lambda = \\left[ 2\\pi h \\left(\\frac{E_f(1-\\nu_s^2)}{3(1-\\nu_f^2)}\\right)^{1/3} \\right] E_s^{-1/3} $$\nThis expression has the form $\\lambda = C \\cdot E_s^{n}$, where $C$ is a constant with respect to $E_s$ and the exponent is $n = -\\frac{1}{3}$. Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\ln \\lambda = \\ln(C) + \\ln(E_s^n) = \\ln(C) + n \\ln(E_s) $$\n$$ \\ln \\lambda = \\ln(C) - \\frac{1}{3} \\ln(E_s) $$\nThe sensitivity $S$ is the derivative of $\\ln \\lambda$ with respect to $\\ln E_s$. Since all other parameters are held fixed, $\\ln(C)$ is a constant:\n$$ S = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial (\\ln E_s)} \\left[ \\ln(C) - \\frac{1}{3} \\ln(E_s) \\right] = -\\frac{1}{3} $$\nThe sensitivity $S$ is an exact constant value, independent of the material properties or film thickness, due to the specific power-law relationship $\\lambda \\propto E_s^{-1/3}$ that arises from the physics of the instability. The numerical value is exactly $-\\frac{1}{3}$.",
