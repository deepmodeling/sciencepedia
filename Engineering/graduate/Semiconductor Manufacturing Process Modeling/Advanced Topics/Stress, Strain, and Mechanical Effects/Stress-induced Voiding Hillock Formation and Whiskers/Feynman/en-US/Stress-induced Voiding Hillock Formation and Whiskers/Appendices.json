It contains no invalidating flaws. Therefore, it is deemed **valid**, and a full solution will be provided.\n\n### Solution Derivation and Calculation\n\nThe equilibrium concentration of vacancies, $c_{v}$, in a crystal is determined by the Gibbs free energy of formation for a single vacancy, $G_{f}$. From statistical thermodynamics, the concentration (expressed as an atomic fraction) is given by:\n$$\nc_{v} = \\frac{n_{v}}{N} = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{G_{f}}{k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $n_{v}$ is the number of vacancies, $N$ is the total number of atomic sites, $k_{B}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $A$ is a pre-exponential factor related to the entropy of formation.\n\nThe Gibbs free energy of formation, $G_{f}$, is the change in the Gibbs free energy of the system upon creating one vacancy. It is defined as:\n$$\nG_{f} = E_{f} - TS_{f} + P\\Omega_{f}\n$$\nHere, $E_{f}$ is the vacancy formation energy (change in internal energy), $S_{f}$ is the vibrational entropy of formation, $P$ is the external hydrostatic pressure, and $\\Omega_{f}$ is the vacancy formation volume. The term $P\\Omega_{f}$ represents the work done by the pressure field to create the vacancy.\n\nIn solid mechanics, it is conventional to work with stress, where tensile stress is positive. Hydrostatic pressure $P$ is equivalent to the negative of the mean stress. For a uniform hydrostatic tensile stress $\\sigma_{h}$, the pressure is $P = -\\sigma_{h}$. Substituting this into the expression for $G_{f}$:\n$$\nG_{f}(\\sigma_{h}) = E_{f} - TS_{f} - \\sigma_{h}\\Omega_{f}\n$$\nThe problem states to treat the vacancy formation volume as approximately equal to the atomic volume, so $\\Omega_{f} \\approx \\Omega$.\n$$\nG_{f}(\\sigma_{h}) \\approx E_{f} - TS_{f} - \\sigma_{h}\\Omega\n$$\nThe equilibrium vacancy concentration under stress $\\sigma_{h}$ is therefore:\n$$\nc_{v}(\\sigma_{h}) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{f} - TS_{f} - \\sigma_{h}\\Omega}{k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\nAt zero stress ($\\sigma_{h} = 0$), the Gibbs free energy of formation is $G_{f}(0) = E_{f} - TS_{f}$, and the corresponding vacancy concentration is:\n$$\nc_{v}(0) = A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{f} - TS_{f}}{k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\nTo find how the stress modifies the concentration, we compute the ratio $c_{v}(\\sigma_{h})/c_{v}(0)$:\n$$\n\\frac{c_{v}(\\sigma_{h})}{c_{v}(0)} = \\frac{A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{f} - TS_{f} - \\sigma_{h}\\Omega}{k_{B}T}\\right)}{A \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{f} - TS_{f}}{k_{B}T}\\right)}\n$$\nThe pre-exponential terms cancel. Using the property $\\exp(a+b) = \\exp(a)\\exp(b)$, we can separate the numerator:\n$$\n\\frac{c_{v}(\\sigma_{h})}{c_{v}(0)} = \\frac{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{f} - TS_{f}}{k_{B}T}\\right) \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{h}\\Omega}{k_{B}T}\\right)}{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_{f} - TS_{f}}{k_{B}T}\\right)}\n$$\nThis simplifies to the final derived expression:\n$$\n\\frac{c_{v}(\\sigma_{h})}{c_{v}(0)} = \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_{h}\\Omega}{k_{B}T}\\right)\n$$\nNote that the vacancy formation energy $E_{f}$ is not required for the calculation of this ratio.\n\nNext, we substitute the given numerical values into this expression. All values must be in base SI units.\n- $\\sigma_{h} = 200\\,\\mathrm{MPa} = 200 \\times 10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{Pa} = 2 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-3}}$\n- $\\Omega = 1.6 \\times 10^{-29}\\,\\mathrm{m^{3}}$\n- $k_{B} = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}$\n- $T = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n\nFirst, we compute the dimensionless exponent:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sigma_{h}\\Omega}{k_{B}T} = \\frac{(2 \\times 10^{8}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,m^{-3}}) \\times (1.6 \\times 10^{-29}\\,\\mathrm{m^{3}})}{(1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\,\\mathrm{J\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (298\\,\\mathrm{K})}\n$$\nThe work term in the numerator is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{h}\\Omega = 3.2 \\times 10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{J}\n$$\nThe thermal energy term in the denominator is:\n$$\nk_{B}T = (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}) \\times 298\\,\\mathrm{J} \\approx 4.114334 \\times 10^{-21}\\,\\mathrm{J}\n$$\nThe exponent is the ratio of these two energies:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sigma_{h}\\Omega}{k_{B}T} \\approx \\frac{3.2 \\times 10^{-21}}{4.114334 \\times 10^{-21}} \\approx 0.7777785\n$$\nFinally, we compute the ratio of vacancy concentrations:\n$$\n\\frac{c_{v}(\\sigma_{h})}{c_{v}(0)} = \\exp(0.7777785) \\approx 2.17666\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures, the ratio is $2.18$.\n\n### Interpretation\nThe result, $c_{v}(\\sigma_{h})/c_{v}(0) \\approx 2.18$, indicates that a hydrostatic tensile stress of $200\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$ more than doubles the equilibrium vacancy concentration in tin at room temperature. A tensile stress effectively lowers the energy required to form a vacancy by an amount $\\sigma_h \\Omega$, thereby increasing its equilibrium population. This has significant implications for reliability in microelectronics:\n1.  **Stress-Induced Voiding**: Voiding is the formation and growth of cavities within the metallization. Since voids are agglomerates of vacancies, an increase in the equilibrium vacancy concentration provides a larger driving force for their nucleation and growth. The tensile stress raises the vacancy \"supply,\" directly promoting the formation of voids, which serves as a mechanism to relieve that stress. This is a primary failure mechanism in interconnects.\n2.  **Hillock Formation and Whisker Growth**: Hillocks and whiskers are extrusions of material that grow to relieve *compressive* stress. While the uniform tensile stress in this problem would not directly cause hillocks, real interconnects often have complex stress gradients. Vacancies will diffuse from regions of compression (where their formation energy is high) to regions of tension (where their formation energy is low). This flux of vacancies from compressive to tensile regions is balanced by a net flux of atoms in the opposite direction—from tensile to compressive regions. The accumulation of these atoms in the compressively stressed areas leads to the formation of hillocks and whiskers. Therefore, the sensitivity of vacancy concentration to stress, as quantified by this problem, is the fundamental mechanism underpinning stress-driven mass transport that leads to both voiding and hillock/whisker growth.",

            "solution": "The problem asks for the derivation of the growth law for a spherical void in a metal interconnect and the time required for it to grow from an initial radius $r_{0}$ to a final radius $R$. The process is driven by a stress-gradient-induced flux of vacancies. The problem is scientifically grounded in the principles of solid-state diffusion and continuum mechanics, and it is well-posed, providing all necessary information to arrive at a unique solution.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the growth of the void and the influx of vacancies. The volume of the spherical void is given by $V(t) = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r(t)^3$, where $r(t)$ is the void radius at time $t$. The growth of the void is due to the accumulation of vacancies, where each vacancy contributes a volume $\\Omega$ (the atomic volume) to the void. The rate of change of the void volume is therefore related to the total number of vacancies arriving at the void surface per unit time, $\\frac{dN_v}{dt}$, by the principle of mass conservation:\n$$\n\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\Omega \\frac{dN_v}{dt}\n$$\nThe rate of change of volume can also be expressed in terms of the rate of change of the radius using the chain rule:\n$$\n\\frac{dV}{dt} = \\frac{d}{dt}\\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\\right) = 4\\pi r^2 \\frac{dr}{dt}\n$$\nEquating the two expressions for $\\frac{dV}{dt}$ gives a relationship between the rate of change of the radius and the vacancy influx:\n$$\n4\\pi r^2 \\frac{dr}{dt} = \\Omega \\frac{dN_v}{dt}\n$$\n\nNext, we determine the total vacancy influx, $\\frac{dN_v}{dt}$. The problem states that the stress-induced vacancy flux is given by the expression $J_{v}=\\frac{D_{v} c_{v} \\Omega}{k T} \\nabla \\sigma_{h}$. The problem specifies that $\\nabla \\sigma_{h}$ is oriented such that the resulting flux $J_v$ is directed inward toward the void surface. Furthermore, it is assumed that the vacancy transport is radially uniform toward the void surface and that the magnitude of the stress gradient, which we denote as $|\\nabla \\sigma_h|$, is constant. Under these assumptions, the magnitude of the vacancy flux, $J_v$, is constant and uniform over the spherical surface of the void. Let us denote the magnitude of the stress gradient by the symbol $\\nabla \\sigma_h$ for notational simplicity, as its directionality is already accounted for in the problem setup. The magnitude of the flux is thus:\n$$\nJ_v = \\frac{D_v c_v \\Omega}{kT} \\nabla \\sigma_h\n$$\nThe total number of vacancies arriving at the void surface per unit time is the product of this flux magnitude and the surface area of the void, $A = 4\\pi r^2$:\n$$\n\\frac{dN_v}{dt} = J_v \\cdot A = \\left(\\frac{D_v c_v \\Omega \\nabla \\sigma_h}{kT}\\right) (4\\pi r^2)\n$$\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for $\\frac{dN_v}{dt}$ back into our equation for $\\frac{dr}{dt}$:\n$$\n4\\pi r^2 \\frac{dr}{dt} = \\Omega \\left[ \\left(\\frac{D_v c_v \\Omega \\nabla \\sigma_h}{kT}\\right) (4\\pi r^2) \\right]\n$$\nThe term $4\\pi r^2$ cancels from both sides (assuming $r > 0$, which is consistent with the problem starting from an initial radius $r_0$).

The flux is driven by the gradient of the chemical potential, $\\mu$. The chemical potential under a hydrostatic stress $\\sigma$ is given as:\n$$ \\mu = \\mu_0 + \\Omega\\,\\sigma $$\nwhere $\\mu_0$ is the reference chemical potential, and $\\Omega$ is the atomic volume.\n\nThe problem states that the hydrostatic stress drops linearly from $\\sigma$ at the film-substrate interface to $0$ at the free surface over the film thickness $t$. Let $x$ be the coordinate along the GB, with $x=0$ at the free surface and $x=t$ at the high-stress interior. The stress profile is $\\sigma(x) = \\sigma \\frac{x}{t}$. The gradient of the chemical potential along the GB is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial\\mu}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (\\mu_0 + \\Omega\\,\\sigma(x)) = \\Omega \\frac{\\partial\\sigma}{\\partial x} = \\Omega \\frac{\\sigma}{t} $$\nThe problem defines flux away from the high-stress region, so if we define the coordinate $x$ from the high-stress interior ($x=0$) to the surface ($x=t$), the stress profile is $\\sigma(x) = \\sigma (1-x/t)$. The gradient becomes:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial\\mu}{\\partial x} = \\Omega \\frac{\\partial\\sigma}{\\partial x} = \\Omega \\left(-\\frac{\\sigma}{t}\\right) = -\\frac{\\Omega\\sigma}{t} $$\nThis gradient is constant along the diffusion path. The atomic number flux $J$ is given by the Fick–Onsager relation:\n$$ J = -\\frac{D_{gb}C}{k_B T} \\frac{\\partial\\mu}{\\partial x} $$\nSubstituting the expression for the chemical potential gradient:\n$$ J = -\\frac{D_{gb}C}{k_B T} \\left(-\\frac{\\Omega\\sigma}{t}\\right) = \\frac{D_{gb}C\\Omega\\sigma}{k_B T t} $$\nHere, $D_{gb}$ is the GB diffusion coefficient, $C$ is the atomic number density, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nThe problem states that the atomic number density $C$ is the bulk density, which can be calculated from mass density $\\rho$, molar mass $M$, and Avogadro's constant $N_A$ as $C = \\frac{\\rho N_A}{M}$.

The expression for the flux simplifies to:\n$$ J = \\frac{D_{gb}\\sigma}{k_B T t} $$\nThis flux represents the number of atoms per unit area of the GB per unit time.\n\nNext, we relate this atomic flux to the growth of the hillock. The GB has a width $\\delta$. Let us consider a segment of the GB trace on the surface of length $L$. The cross-sectional area for diffusion out onto the surface is $A_{out} = \\delta L$.
