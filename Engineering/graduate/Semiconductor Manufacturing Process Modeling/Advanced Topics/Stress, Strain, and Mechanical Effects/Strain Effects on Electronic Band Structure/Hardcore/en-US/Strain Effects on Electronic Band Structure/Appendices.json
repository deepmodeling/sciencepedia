This splitting is caused by the strain component of the Bir–Pikus Hamiltonian, which describes the effect of strain on the valence band structure at the center of the Brillouin zone (the $\\Gamma$-point).

It shifts all four $j=3/2$ states by the same amount and thus does not contribute to any splitting. The third term, proportional to $d$, involves the shear strain components $\\epsilon_{ik}$ with $i \\neq k$.\n\nThe problem states that the strain tensor is diagonal, with $\\epsilon_{xx} = \\epsilon_{yy} = \\epsilon_{\\parallel}$, $\\epsilon_{zz} = \\epsilon_{\\perp}$, and all shear components $\\epsilon_{ik} = 0$ for $i \\neq k$. This corresponds to a biaxial strain in the $(xy)$-plane, which is typical for epitaxial layers grown on a substrate in the $[001]$ direction.

The VBM is the state with the highest energy. Since $\\Delta_{hh-lh} = E_{hh} - E_{lh}  0$, we have $E_{hh}  E_{lh}$.

This meets the criteria.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\nThe total conductivity $\\sigma$ of the hole gas is the sum of the conductivities from the heavy-hole ($\\sigma_{hh}$) and light-hole ($\\sigma_{lh}$) subbands:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\sigma_{hh} + \\sigma_{lh}\n$$\nAccording to the Drude model, the conductivity of a carrier population $i$ is given by $\\sigma_i = p_i q^2 \\tau_i / m_i$, where $p_i$ is the carrier concentration, $q$ is the elementary charge, $\\tau_i$ is the momentum relaxation time, and $m_i$ is the effective mass. Applying this to our two hole populations and using the given assumption that the relaxation time $\\tau$ is the same for both, we have:\n$$\n\\sigma_{hh} = \\frac{p_{hh} q^2 \\tau}{m_{hh}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\sigma_{lh} = \\frac{p_{lh} q^2 \\tau}{m_{lh}}\n$$\nHere, $p_{hh}$ and $p_{lh}$ are the hole densities in the heavy-hole and light-hole bands, respectively. The total conductivity is thus:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{p_{hh} q^2 \\tau}{m_{hh}} + \\frac{p_{lh} q^2 \\tau}{m_{lh}} = q^2 \\tau \\left( \\frac{p_{hh}}{m_{hh}} + \\frac{p_{lh}}{m_{lh}} \\right)\n$$\nThe problem defines the conductivity-effective mass $m_{\\text{cond}}$ through the relation for the total conductivity:\n$$\n\\sigma = \\frac{p q^2 \\tau}{m_{\\text{cond}}}\n$$\nwhere $p$ is the total hole density, $p = p_{hh} + p_{lh}$. By equating the two expressions for $\\sigma$, we can solve for $m_{\\text{cond}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{(p_{hh} + p_{lh}) q^2 \\tau}{m_{\\text{cond}}} = q^2 \\tau \\left( \\frac{p_{hh}}{m_{hh}} + \\frac{p_{lh}}{m_{lh}} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{p_{hh} + p_{lh}}{m_{\\text{cond}}} = \\frac{p_{hh}}{m_{hh}} + \\frac{p_{lh}}{m_{lh}}\n$$\nSolving for $m_{\\text{cond}}$ yields:\n$$\nm_{\\text{cond}} = \\frac{p_{hh} + p_{lh}}{\\frac{p_{hh}}{m_{hh}} + \\frac{p_{lh}}{m_{lh}}}\n$$\nWe can rewrite this expression in terms of the population ratio $p_{lh}/p_{hh}$:\n$$\nm_{\\text{cond}} = \\frac{1 + \\frac{p_{lh}}{p_{hh}}}{\\frac{1}{m_{hh}} + \\frac{p_{lh}}{p_{hh}}\\frac{1}{m_{lh}}}\n$$\nThe next step is to determine the ratio of hole populations, $p_{lh}/p_{hh}$. Under the assumption of nondegenerate statistics (Maxwell-Boltzmann), the concentration of holes in a valence subband $i$ is given by:\n$$\np_i = N_{v,i} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_F - E_{v,i}}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $N_{v,i}$ is the effective density of states for subband $i$, $E_F$ is the Fermi level, $E_{v,i}$ is the energy of the subband edge, and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. The effective density of states for a 3D parabolic band is proportional to the effective mass raised to the power of $3/2$: $N_{v,i} \\propto (m_i)^{3/2}$.\n\nThe ratio of the hole populations is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{p_{lh}}{p_{hh}} = \\frac{N_{v,lh} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_F - E_{v,lh}}{k_B T}\\right)}{N_{v,hh} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_F - E_{v,hh}}{k_B T}\\right)} = \\frac{N_{v,lh}}{N_{v,hh}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{v,lh} - E_{v,hh}}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting the mass dependence of $N_v$:\n$$\n\\frac{p_{lh}}{p_{hh}} = \\left(\\frac{m_{lh}}{m_{hh}}\\right)^{3/2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{v,lh} - E_{v,hh}}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nThe problem states that the heavy-hole band forms the valence-band maximum. We can set its energy as the reference, $E_{v,hh} = 0$. The strain lifts the degeneracy, and the energy splitting is $\\Delta_{hh\\text{-}lh}$. Thus, the light-hole band edge is at a lower energy, $E_{v,lh} = -\\Delta_{hh\\text{-}lh}$. The energy difference is $E_{v,lh} - E_{v,hh} = -\\Delta_{hh\\text{-}lh}$.\nSubstituting this into the population ratio expression gives:\n$$\n\\frac{p_{lh}}{p_{hh}} = \\left(\\frac{m_{lh}}{m_{hh}}\\right)^{3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta_{hh\\text{-}lh}}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nThis expression can now be used to compute the conductivity-effective mass.\n\n### Numerical Calculation\nFirst, we compute the value of the thermal energy $k_B T$ at $T=300 \\text{ K}$. Using $k_B \\approx 8.61733 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/K}$:\n$$\nk_B T = (8.61733 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ eV/K}) \\times (300 \\text{ K}) \\approx 0.025852 \\text{ eV} = 25.852 \\text{ meV}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the exponent in the Boltzmann factor:\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta_{hh\\text{-}lh}}{k_B T} = \\frac{40 \\text{ meV}}{25.852 \\text{ meV}} \\approx 1.54727\n$$\nNow, we calculate the population ratio, which we denote as $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{p_{lh}}{p_{hh}} = \\left(\\frac{m_{lh}}{m_{hh}}\\right)^{3/2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta_{hh\\text{-}lh}}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the given effective masses, $m_{hh} = 0.50\\,m_{0}$ and $m_{lh} = 0.08\\,m_{0}$:\n$$\n\\frac{m_{lh}}{m_{hh}} = \\frac{0.08\\,m_{0}}{0.50\\,m_{0}} = 0.16\n$$\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{m_{lh}}{m_{hh}}\\right)^{3/2} = (0.16)^{3/2} = (0.4^2)^{3/2} = 0.4^3 = 0.064\n$$\n$$\nR = 0.064 \\times \\exp(-1.54727) \\approx 0.064 \\times 0.21283 \\approx 0.013621\n$$\nFinally, we compute $m_{\\text{cond}}$. Let us express the masses as multiples of $m_0$, i.e., $m_i' = m_i/m_0$.\n$$\nm_{\\text{cond}} = \\frac{1 + R}{\\frac{1}{m_{hh}} + \\frac{R}{m_{lh}}} = m_0 \\frac{1 + R}{\\frac{1}{m_{hh}'} + \\frac{R}{m_{lh}'}}\n$$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$\n\\frac{m_{\\text{cond}}}{m_0} = \\frac{1 + 0.013621}{\\frac{1}{0.50} + \\frac{0.013621}{0.08}} = \\frac{1.013621}{2 + 0.1702625} = \\frac{1.013621}{2.1702625} \\approx 0.467049\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures gives:\n$$\n\\frac{m_{\\text{cond}}}{m_0} \\approx 0.4670\n$$\nThus, the conductivity-effective hole mass is $0.4670\\,m_{0}$.",
