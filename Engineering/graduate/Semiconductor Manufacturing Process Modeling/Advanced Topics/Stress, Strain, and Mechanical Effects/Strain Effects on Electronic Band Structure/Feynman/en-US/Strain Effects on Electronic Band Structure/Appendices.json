A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe energy shift, $\\Delta E_c$, of a conduction band minimum (valley) due to an applied strain tensor $\\epsilon_{ij}$ is described by deformation potential theory. For the six equivalent valleys of silicon, located along the $\\langle 100 \\rangle$ crystallographic directions, the energy shift for a valley oriented along the unit vector $\\hat{k}=(k_x, k_y, k_z)$ is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta E_c^{(\\hat{k})} = \\sum_{i,j} \\left( \\Xi_d \\delta_{ij} + \\Xi_u k_i k_j \\right) \\epsilon_{ij}\n$$\nHere, $\\Xi_d$ is the hydrostatic deformation potential, which governs the energy shift due to a change in volume, and $\\Xi_u$ is the uniaxial (or shear) deformation potential, which governs the energy shift due to strain that breaks the cubic symmetry. The term $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nThe expression can be separated into two parts: a hydrostatic shift and a uniaxial shift. The hydrostatic component is proportional to the trace of the strain tensor, $\\text{Tr}(\\mathbf{\\epsilon}) = \\sum_i \\epsilon_{ii}$, and is the same for all valleys:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{hydro} = \\Xi_d \\sum_{i,j} \\delta_{ij} \\epsilon_{ij} = \\Xi_d \\sum_i \\epsilon_{ii} = \\Xi_d (\\epsilon_{xx} + \\epsilon_{yy} + \\epsilon_{zz})\n$$\nThe uniaxial component depends on the orientation $\\hat{k}$ of the valley:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{shear}^{(\\hat{k})} = \\Xi_u \\sum_{i,j} k_i k_j \\epsilon_{ij}\n$$\nThe problem specifies a diagonal strain tensor, so $\\epsilon_{ij} = 0$ for $i \\neq j$.

These energies are calculated relative to the unstrained conduction band minimum, which is taken as the zero reference energy.\n\n**1. Valleys along the $\\pm x$ axis:**\nFor these two valleys, the direction vectors are $\\hat{k} = (\\pm 1, 0, 0)$. Thus, $k_x^2 = 1$, and $k_y^2 = k_z^2 = 0$.

The calculated values are $0.0852$ eV and $-0.0228$ eV, which are already expressed to three significant figures.\n\nThe final valley energies relative to the unstrained conduction band minimum are:\n$E_{+x} = 0.0852$ eV\n$E_{-x} = 0.0852$ eV\n$E_{+y} = 0.0852$ eV\n$E_{-y} = 0.0852$ eV\n$E_{+z} = -0.0228$ eV\n$E_{-z} = -0.0228$ eV\n\nBy comparing the energy values, we can deduce which valleys are lowest in energy. The four in-plane valleys ($x$ and $y$) have an energy of $0.0852$ eV, while the two out-of-plane valleys ($z$) have an energy of $-0.0228$ eV. Since $-0.0228  0.0852$, the two valleys lowest in energy are the pair along the $\\pm z$ axis. This energy splitting is a direct consequence of the strain: the biaxial tensile strain in the $xy$-plane raises the energy of the four in-plane valleys, while the compensating compressive strain along the $z$-axis lowers the energy of the two out-of-plane valleys.\n\nThe final answer is the six-component row vector $(E_{+x}, E_{-x}, E_{+y}, E_{-y}, E_{+z}, E_{-z})$.",

This splitting is caused by the strain component of the Bir–Pikus Hamiltonian, which describes the effect of strain on the valence band structure at the center of the Brillouin zone (the $\\Gamma$-point).

The VBM is the state with the highest energy. Since $\\Delta_{hh-lh} = E_{hh} - E_{lh}  0$, we have $E_{hh}  E_{lh}$. This means the light-hole doublet is at a higher energy than the heavy-hole doublet. Therefore, the light-hole doublet is \"energetically favored\" and forms the VBM.\nThe band-selection indicator $s$ is defined as $s = +1$ for the hh doublet at the VBM and $s = -1$ for the lh doublet at the VBM. Since the lh doublet is at the VBM, we have $s = -1$.\n\nThe result is a two-component row matrix with the numerical value of the splitting and the band-selection indicator.\nThe first component is $-0.06400$.\nThe second component is $-1$.",
