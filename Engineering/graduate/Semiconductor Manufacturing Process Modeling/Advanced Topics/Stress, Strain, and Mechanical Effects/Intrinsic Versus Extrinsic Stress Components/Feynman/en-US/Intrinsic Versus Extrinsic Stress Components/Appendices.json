This first exercise provides a concrete, quantitative link between a specific microscopic growth defect—the incorporation of interstitial atoms—and the resulting macroscopic intrinsic stress . By treating the volume expansion from these interstitials as an *eigenstrain*, you will use the principles of linear elasticity to derive the stress that arises when this expansion is constrained by a rigid substrate. This foundational practice demonstrates how materials science concepts are translated into the language of continuum mechanics for process modeling.",

            "problem": "A crystalline thin film of a semiconductor is uniformly doped with interstitial species during deposition. Each interstitial possesses an eigenvolume $\\Omega_{i}$ and, when incorporated at a number concentration $c_{i}$ (number per unit volume), produces an isotropic chemical expansion represented by the eigenstrain tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^{*} = \\epsilon^{*} \\mathbf{I}$ with $\\epsilon^{*} = \\Omega_{i} c_{i}$, where $\\mathbf{I}$ is the identity tensor. The film is elastically isotropic with Young’s modulus $E$ and Poisson’s ratio $\\nu$. It is perfectly bonded to a much thicker, effectively rigid substrate such that the in-plane total strains are constrained to be zero, while the film’s free surface imposes zero normal stress. Assume the temperature history is chosen such that extrinsic stress components (for example, thermal mismatch stress and deposition-induced extrinsic stress) are negligible, and only the intrinsic stress arising from interstitial incorporation is present.\n\nStarting from the linear isotropic elasticity constitutive relation with eigenstrain and the additive decomposition of strain, and enforcing the boundary conditions of a thin film under equi-biaxial constraint (in-plane total strains equal to zero and out-of-plane stress equal to zero), derive the intrinsic equi-biaxial in-plane stress $\\sigma$ in the film as a closed-form expression in terms of $E$, $\\nu$, $\\Omega_{i}$, and $c_{i}$.

            "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective.\n\n### Step 1: Extract Givens\n- A crystalline thin film with uniform doping of interstitial species.\n- The eigenvolume per interstitial species is $\\Omega_{i}$.\n- The number concentration of interstitials is $c_{i}$ (number per unit volume).\n- The eigenstrain tensor is isotropic: $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^{*} = \\epsilon^{*} \\mathbf{I}$, where $\\mathbf{I}$ is the identity tensor.\n- The magnitude of the isotropic eigenstrain is $\\epsilon^{*} = \\Omega_{i} c_{i}$.\n- The film is elastically isotropic with Young's modulus $E$ and Poisson's ratio $\\nu$.\n- The film is perfectly bonded to a rigid substrate, imposing the constraint of zero in-plane total strains.\n- The film's top surface is free, resulting in zero normal stress in the out-of-plane direction.\n- Extrinsic stress sources are negligible; only intrinsic stress is considered.\n- The sign convention for stress is that compressive stress is negative.\n- The objective is to derive the intrinsic equi-biaxial in-plane stress, denoted $\\sigma$.\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem statement is scientifically sound, resting on the established principles of linear elasticity, solid mechanics, and materials science. The concept of eigenstrain (also known as misfit strain) due to chemical effects (interstitial incorporation) is a standard model in the study of stress in thin films. The boundary conditions—a film constrained biaxially by a rigid substrate with a free surface—represent a classic and well-posed problem in thin-film mechanics. All necessary parameters ($E$, $\\nu$, $\\Omega_{i}$, $c_{i}$) and conditions are provided, and there are no internal contradictions or ambiguities. The problem is a direct and formalizable application of theory, relevant to the topic of intrinsic stress in semiconductor manufacturing. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n### Step 3: Derivation of the Intrinsic Stress\nThe solution begins with the fundamental principle of additive strain decomposition. The total strain tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the elastic strain tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_{\\text{elastic}}$, and the eigenstrain (or misfit strain) tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^{*}$:\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_{\\text{total}} = \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}_{\\text{elastic}} + \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^{*}\n$$\nThe stress in the material, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, is generated only by the elastic strain, as described by the linear isotropic elastic constitutive relation (Hooke's Law). The strain-stress form of this relation is:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{ij}^{\\text{elastic}} = \\frac{1}{E} \\left[ (1+\\nu)\\sigma_{ij} - \\nu \\delta_{ij} \\sum_{k=1}^{3} \\sigma_{kk} \\right]\n$$\nwhere $\\sigma_{ij}$ and $\\epsilon_{ij}^{\\text{elastic}}$ are the components of the stress and elastic strain tensors, respectively, and $\\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta.\n\nWe establish a Cartesian coordinate system where the film lies in the $x_1$-$x_2$ plane (in-plane directions) and the $x_3$ direction is normal to the film plane (out-of-plane direction).\n\nThe problem specifies an equi-biaxial state of stress in the film plane due to the isotropic nature of the eigenstrain and the in-plane constraints. This implies:\n$$\n\\sigma_{11} = \\sigma_{22} = \\sigma\n$$\nAll shear stress components are zero due to symmetry: $\\sigma_{12} = \\sigma_{13} = \\sigma_{23} = 0$.\n\nThe boundary condition at the free surface of the film dictates that the stress component normal to this surface must be zero:\n$$\n\\sigma_{33} = 0\n$$\nThe problem states that the film is bonded to a rigid substrate, which constrains the total in-plane strains to be zero:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{11}^{\\text{total}} = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\epsilon_{22}^{\\text{total}} = 0\n$$\nThe eigenstrain is isotropic, given by $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}^{*} = \\epsilon^{*} \\mathbf{I}$, where $\\epsilon^{*} = \\Omega_{i} c_{i}$. In component form:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{11}^{*} = \\epsilon_{22}^{*} = \\epsilon_{33}^{*} = \\epsilon^{*} = \\Omega_{i} c_{i}\n$$\nand all off-diagonal eigenstrain components are zero.\n\nNow, we use the strain decomposition for an in-plane component, for instance $\\epsilon_{11}^{\\text{total}}$:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{11}^{\\text{total}} = \\epsilon_{11}^{\\text{elastic}} + \\epsilon_{11}^{*}\n$$\nApplying the rigid substrate constraint, $\\epsilon_{11}^{\\text{total}} = 0$, we find the required elastic strain in the plane:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{11}^{\\text{elastic}} = - \\epsilon_{11}^{*} = - \\epsilon^{*}\n$$\nNext, we express the elastic strain $\\epsilon_{11}^{\\text{elastic}}$ using Hooke's Law in terms of the stress components:\n$$\n\\epsilon_{11}^{\\text{elastic}} = \\frac{1}{E} \\left[ \\sigma_{11} - \\nu (\\sigma_{22} + \\sigma_{33}) \\right]\n$$\nSubstituting the known stress components ($\\sigma_{11} = \\sigma$, $\\sigma_{22} = \\sigma$, $\\sigma_{33} = 0$):\n$$\n\\epsilon_{11}^{\\text{elastic}} = \\frac{1}{E} \\left[ \\sigma - \\nu (\\sigma + 0) \\right] = \\frac{\\sigma (1-\\nu)}{E}\n$$\nWe now have two expressions for $\\epsilon_{11}^{\\text{elastic}}$. Equating them allows us to solve for the unknown in-plane stress $\\sigma$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sigma (1-\\nu)}{E} = - \\epsilon^{*}\n$$\nSolving for $\\sigma$:\n$$\n\\sigma = - \\frac{E \\epsilon^{*}}{1-\\nu}\n$$\nFinally, we substitute the given expression for the eigenstrain magnitude, $\\epsilon^{*} = \\Omega_{i} c_{i}$:\n$$\n\\sigma = - \\frac{E \\Omega_{i} c_{i}}{1-\\nu}\n$$\nThis expression represents the intrinsic equi-biaxial stress in the thin film. The negative sign indicates that for a positive eigenvolume $\\Omega_i$ (as expected for interstitials) and positive concentration $c_i$, the film is under compressive stress, which aligns with the physical situation where an expanding film is constrained by a rigid substrate and the given sign convention.",

It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and complete. A solution will be derived and implemented.\n\n### Derivation and Solution\n\nThe derivation of the extrinsic film stress $ \\sigma(t) $ proceeds from the fundamental principles provided.\n\n1.  **Kinematic Constraint**: The thin film is perfectly bonded to a much thicker substrate. Therefore, the total in-plane strain of the film, $ \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{film}}^{\\mathrm{total}} $, is constrained to be equal to the free thermal strain of the substrate, $ \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{sub}}^{\\mathrm{th}} $. Since the system is isotropic and the thermal load is uniform, the strains are equal in all in-plane directions. We can write this scalar relationship as:\n    $$ \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{film}}^{\\mathrm{total}}(t) = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{sub}}^{\\mathrm{th}}(t) $$\n\n2.  **Strain Decomposition**: The total strain in the film is the linear superposition of its mechanical strain $ \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{film}}^{\\mathrm{mech}} $ (which causes stress) and its own free thermal strain $ \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{film}}^{\\mathrm{th}} $:\n    $$ \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{film}}^{\\mathrm{total}}(t) = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{film}}^{\\mathrm{mech}}(t) + \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{film}}^{\\mathrm{th}}(t) $$\n\n3.  **Mechanical Strain**: By combining the first two points, we can isolate the mechanical strain in the film. This strain represents the mismatch between the film's natural thermal expansion and the expansion imposed by the substrate.\n    $$ \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{film}}^{\\mathrm{mech}}(t) = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{film}}^{\\mathrm{total}}(t) - \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{film}}^{\\mathrm{th}}(t) = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{sub}}^{\\mathrm{th}}(t) - \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{film}}^{\\mathrm{th}}(t) $$\n\n4.  **Thermal Strain Formulation**: The thermal strain for a material (film or substrate) is the integral of its temperature-dependent coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), $ \\alpha(\\theta) $, over the temperature path from a stress-free reference temperature $ T_{\\mathrm{ref}} $ to the current temperature $ T(t) $.\n    $$ \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{th}}(t) = \\int_{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}^{T(t)} \\alpha(\\theta) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\theta $$\n    Substituting this into the expression for mechanical strain gives the mismatch strain:\n    $$ \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{film}}^{\\mathrm{mech}}(t) = \\int_{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}^{T(t)} \\alpha_s(\\theta) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\theta - \\int_{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}^{T(t)} \\alpha_f(\\theta) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\theta = \\int_{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}^{T(t)} \\left( \\alpha_s(\\theta) - \\alpha_f(\\theta) \\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\theta $$\n\n5.  **Constitutive Relation (Stress-Strain)**: The problem states the film is under equi-biaxial plane stress ($ \\sigma_{xx} = \\sigma_{yy} = \\sigma $, $ \\sigma_{zz} = 0 $). For an isotropic linear elastic material, the in-plane mechanical strain $ \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{mech}} $ is related to the in-plane stress $ \\sigma $ by:\n    $$ \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{mech}} = \\frac{1}{E} \\left[ \\sigma - \\nu (\\sigma + 0) \\right] = \\frac{1-\\nu}{E} \\sigma $$\n    Solving for stress $ \\sigma $ yields:\n    $$ \\sigma = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu} \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{mech}} = M \\varepsilon^{\\mathrm{mech}} $$\n    where $ M(T) = E(T)/(1-\\nu(T)) $ is the biaxial modulus, evaluated at the instantaneous temperature $ T(t) $.\n\n6.  **Final Expression for Stress**: Combining the results, we obtain the complete expression for the time-dependent extrinsic stress in the film:\n    $$ \\sigma(t) = \\frac{E_f(T(t))}{1 - \\nu_f(T(t))} \\int_{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}^{T(t)} \\left( \\alpha_s(\\theta) - \\alpha_f(\\theta) \\right) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\theta $$\n\n### Computational Implementation\n\nTo compute the result for each test case, the following steps are taken:\n1.  **Analytical Integration**: The CTE functions $ \\alpha_s(T) $ and $ \\alpha_f(T) $ are given as polynomials in $ (T-300) $. Their difference, $ \\Delta\\alpha(T) = \\alpha_s(T) - \\alpha_f(T) $, is also a polynomial. The integral $ \\int \\Delta\\alpha(\\theta) \\, \\mathrm{d}\\theta $ can be computed analytically, resulting in a primitive function, say $ I(T) $. The definite integral is then simply $ I(T(t)) - I(T_{\\mathrm{ref}}) $.\n2.  **Numerical Maximization**: The final stress function $ \\sigma(t) $ is a complex composition of functions. To find the maximum absolute value $ \\max|\\sigma(t)| $ over the time window $ [t_{\\mathrm{start}}, t_{\\mathrm{end}}] $, a numerical approach is most robust. The time interval is discretized into a large number of points. At each point $ t_i $, the temperature $ T(t_i) $ is calculated, followed by the material properties $ E_f(T(t_i)) $, $ \\nu_f(T(t_i)) $, and the mismatch strain. These are combined to compute $ \\sigma(t_i) $. The maximum of the absolute values of the computed stresses is then found.\n3.  **Unit Conversion**: The film modulus $ E_f $ is given in GPa.

This practice introduces the concept of time-dependent mechanics by modeling the relaxation of an initial intrinsic deposition stress using a fundamental viscoelastic model . Starting from the constitutive laws for a spring and dashpot in a Maxwell configuration, you will derive and solve the governing differential equation for stress relaxation at a constant temperature. This exercise provides a first step into the dynamics of stress evolution, a critical factor in ensuring the long-term stability and reliability of semiconductor devices.",

Immediately after deposition at a constant temperature $T=T_{0}$, the film possesses an intrinsic deposition stress $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{int}}(0)$ due to microstructural processes during growth; assume there is no extrinsic thermal mismatch stress because the temperature is held constant and the coefficient-of-thermal-expansion mismatch never experiences a temperature change. Model the film’s in-plane viscoelastic response as a linear Maxwell element composed of a linear elastic spring of Young’s modulus $E$ in series with a Newtonian dashpot of viscosity $\\eta$. Let the total in-plane strain history of the film be $\\epsilon(t)$, and let $\\sigma(t)$ denote the in-plane film stress.

            "solution": "The problem is first validated to ensure it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and all necessary parameters are provided. The solution proceeds by first deriving the governing equations and then performing the numerical evaluation.\n\n### Step 1: Derivation of the Stress Relaxation Function\nA linear Maxwell element consists of a linear elastic spring and a Newtonian dashpot connected in series. The total strain $\\epsilon(t)$ is the sum of the strain in the spring, $\\epsilon_s(t)$, and the strain in the dashpot, $\\epsilon_d(t)$. The strain rates are therefore additive:\n$$\n\\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = \\dot{\\epsilon}_s(t) + \\dot{\\epsilon}_d(t)\n$$\nwhere the dot denotes the time derivative, $\\frac{d}{dt}$.\n\nThe constitutive relations for the spring (Hooke's Law, with Young's modulus $E$) and the dashpot (Newtonian fluid, with viscosity $\\eta$) are used to express the strain rates in terms of stress $\\sigma(t)$:\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = E \\epsilon_s(t) \\implies \\dot{\\epsilon}_s(t) = \\frac{1}{E}\\dot{\\sigma}(t)\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma(t) = \\eta \\dot{\\epsilon}_d(t) \\implies \\dot{\\epsilon}_d(t) = \\frac{1}{\\eta}\\sigma(t)\n$$\nSubstituting these into the strain rate additivity equation yields the general governing differential equation for the Maxwell element:\n$$\n\\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = \\frac{1}{E}\\dot{\\sigma}(t) + \\frac{1}{\\eta}\\sigma(t)\n$$\nFor the specific case of stress relaxation, the in-plane strain is held constant ($\\epsilon(t) = \\epsilon_0$), meaning the total strain rate is zero: $\\dot{\\epsilon}(t) = 0$. The equation simplifies to:\n$$\n0 = \\frac{1}{E}\\dot{\\sigma}(t) + \\frac{1}{\\eta}\\sigma(t) \\implies \\dot{\\sigma}(t) = -\\frac{E}{\\eta}\\sigma(t)\n$$\nSince the problem states that extrinsic stress is zero, the total stress $\\sigma(t)$ is purely the intrinsic stress, $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{int}}(t)$. We solve this first-order ODE for $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{int}}(t)$ with the initial condition $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{int}}(0) = \\sigma_0$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\sigma_{\\mathrm{int}}}{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{int}}} = -\\frac{E}{\\eta} dt\n$$\nIntegrating from $t=0$ to $t$ gives the solution for intrinsic stress relaxation, where $\\tau = \\eta/E$ is the characteristic relaxation time:\n$$\n\\sigma_{\\mathrm{int}}(t) = \\sigma_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)\n$$\n\n### Step 2: Numerical Evaluation\nThe parameters for evaluation are:\n-   Initial stress: $\\sigma_0 = 300\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$\n-   Young's modulus: $E = 100\\,\\mathrm{GPa} = 1.0 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}$\n-   Viscosity: $\\eta = 1.0 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}$\n-   Time: $t = 2\\,\\mathrm{h} = 7200\\,\\mathrm{s}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the relaxation time $\\tau$:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{\\eta}{E} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}\\cdot\\mathrm{s}}{1.0 \\times 10^{11}\\,\\mathrm{Pa}} = 1.0 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{s}\n$$\nNow, substitute the values into the stress relaxation equation.
