            "solution": "The user wants me to identify the appropriate two-dimensional modeling assumption and the corresponding constitutive relations for a thin film on a silicon wafer.\n\n### Step 1: Problem Validation\n\n**1.1. Extract Givens:**\n- **System:** A circular silicon wafer coated with a silicon nitride film.\n- **Wafer Geometry:** Radius $R = 150\\,\\mathrm{mm}$, thickness $t_s = 775\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n- **Film Geometry:** Thickness $t_f = 200\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\n- **Process:** High-temperature deposition causing residual stress.\n- **Boundary Conditions:** The wafer is laterally unconstrained. Top and bottom surfaces are traction-free.\n- **Region of Interest:** Far-field region, away from edges and local features.\n- **Material Model:** Small-strain, linear, isotropic elasticity with Young’s modulus $E$ and Poisson’s ratio $\\nu$.\n- **Objective:** Reduce the three-dimensional (3D) constitutive description to a two-dimensional (2D) formulation for the in-plane stress field.\n\n**1.2. Validate Using Extracted Givens:**\n- **Scientific Groundedness:** The problem is a standard application of continuum mechanics to thin film-substrate systems, a cornerstone of process modeling in semiconductor manufacturing. The principles of linear elasticity, plane stress, and plane strain are well-established. This is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The question asks for the appropriate modeling simplification for a clearly defined physical system. The information provided is sufficient to make a reasoned choice based on first principles of solid mechanics. A unique, meaningful answer can be determined. The problem is well-posed.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, technical language. It is free from subjective claims.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The geometric dimensions and boundary conditions are specified and are consistent. The wafer is a thin structure, as its thickness ($t_s+t_f \\approx 775\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$) is much smaller than its lateral dimension (diameter $2R = 300\\,\\mathrm{mm}$). This information is crucial and sufficient for the analysis.\n- **Realism and Feasibility:** The dimensions provided for the wafer and film are realistic for the semiconductor industry (e.g., a $300\\,\\mathrm{mm}$ wafer). The scenario of residual stress from film deposition is a primary concern in manufacturing. The setup is physically realistic.\n\n**1.3. Verdict and Action:**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in applied mechanics. I will now proceed to derive the solution.\n\n### Step 2: Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe problem is to determine the appropriate 2D simplification (plane stress or plane strain) for modeling the in-plane mechanical behavior of a thin film on a wafer. Let the wafer lie in the $x-y$ plane, with the $z$-axis being normal to the wafer surface.\n\nThe key features of the system are its geometry and boundary conditions. The total thickness, $t = t_s + t_f = 775\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} + 0.2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m} = 775.2\\,\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, is vastly smaller than the radius, $R = 150\\,\\mathrm{mm}$. The aspect ratio of thickness to diameter is approximately $775.2 \\times 10^{-6} / (300 \\times 10^{-3}) \\approx 0.0026$. This defines a \"thin plate\" geometry.\n\nThe problem states that the top and bottom surfaces are \"traction-free.\" This means that the stress vector acting on these surfaces is zero. For a surface with a normal in the $z$-direction, this implies that the stress components $\\sigma_{zz}$, $\\tau_{zx}$ (or $\\tau_{xz}$), and $\\tau_{zy}$ (or $\\tau_{yz}$) are zero on these surfaces.\n\n**Choice of 2D Assumption:**\n\n- **Plane Stress:** The plane stress assumption is applicable to thin, plate-like bodies where the stress components acting perpendicular to the plate are negligible compared to the in-plane stress components. The assumption is formulated as $\\sigma_{zz} = \\sigma_{xz} = \\sigma_{yz} = 0$ throughout the body's thickness. Given that the structure is very thin and these stress components are zero at the top and bottom surfaces, it is a very accurate approximation to assume they are zero everywhere through the small thickness. This assumption allows for out-of-plane deformation, so the out-of-plane normal strain, $\\varepsilon_{zz}$, is generally non-zero. This is consistent with physical phenomena like wafer bowing due to residual stress.\n\n- **Plane Strain:** The plane strain assumption is applicable when a body is very long in one direction and is constrained from deforming in that direction. The strains in that direction are assumed to be zero. For our coordinate system, this would mean $\\varepsilon_{zz} = \\varepsilon_{xz} = \\varepsilon_{yz} = 0$. This implies that the wafer cannot change its thickness, which is physically incorrect. To prevent thickness change, a non-zero stress $\\sigma_{zz} = \\nu(\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy})$ would be required, which would violate the traction-free boundary condition $\\sigma_{zz}=0$ at the surfaces.\n\nTherefore, for a thin wafer, the **plane stress** assumption is the physically appropriate simplification.\n\n**Derivation of Plane Stress Constitutive Relations:**\n\nWe begin with the 3D isotropic linear elastic constitutive relations (Hooke's law), which express strain in terms of stress:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{xx} = \\frac{1}{E} [ \\sigma_{xx} - \\nu (\\sigma_{yy} + \\sigma_{zz}) ] $$\n$$ \\varepsilon_{yy} = \\frac{1}{E} [ \\sigma_{yy} - \\nu (\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{zz}) ] $$\n$$ \\varepsilon_{zz} = \\frac{1}{E} [ \\sigma_{zz} - \\nu (\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy}) ] $$\n$$ \\gamma_{xy} = \\frac{1}{G} \\tau_{xy}, \\quad \\gamma_{yz} = \\frac{1}{G} \\tau_{yz}, \\quad \\gamma_{zx} = \\frac{1}{G} \\tau_{zx} $$\nwhere $G = \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)}$ is the shear modulus.\n\nApplying the plane stress condition, $\\sigma_{zz} = \\sigma_{xz} = \\sigma_{yz} = 0$, the equations simplify to:\n$$ \\varepsilon_{xx} = \\frac{1}{E} (\\sigma_{xx} - \\nu \\sigma_{yy}) \\quad (1)$$\n$$ \\varepsilon_{yy} = \\frac{1}{E} (\\sigma_{yy} - \\nu \\sigma_{xx}) \\quad (2)$$\n$$ \\gamma_{xy} = \\frac{2(1+\\nu)}{E} \\tau_{xy} \\quad (3)$$\nNote that $\\varepsilon_{zz} = -\\frac{\\nu}{E}(\\sigma_{xx} + \\sigma_{yy})$ is generally non-zero.\n\nThe problem asks for the relations linking stress to strain. We must invert the system of equations (1), (2), and (3).\nFrom (3):\n$$ \\tau_{xy} = \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)} \\gamma_{xy} $$\nTo solve for $\\sigma_{xx}$ and $\\sigma_{yy}$, we can multiply equations (1) and (2) by $E$:\n$$ E\\varepsilon_{xx} = \\sigma_{xx} - \\nu \\sigma_{yy} $$\n$$ E\\varepsilon_{yy} = \\sigma_{yy} - \\nu \\sigma_{xx} $$\nSolving this linear system for $\\sigma_{xx}$ and $\\sigma_{yy}$ yields:\n$$ \\sigma_{xx} = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2} (\\varepsilon_{xx} + \\nu \\varepsilon_{yy}) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{yy} = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2} (\\varepsilon_{yy} + \\nu \\varepsilon_{xx}) $$\nThese are the constitutive relations for a state of plane stress.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n**A. Adopt plane stress; use the reduced isotropic linear elastic relations ...**\n- The assumption \"plane stress\" is correct for this physical system.\n- The provided constitutive relations are:\n  $$ \\sigma_{xx} = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\\left(\\varepsilon_{xx} + \\nu \\varepsilon_{yy}\\right) $$\n  $$ \\sigma_{yy} = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}\\left(\\varepsilon_{yy} + \\nu \\varepsilon_{xx}\\right) $$\n  $$ \\tau_{xy} = \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)}\\,\\gamma_{xy} $$\n- These equations perfectly match the derived plane stress relations.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Adopt plane strain; use the reduced isotropic linear elastic relations ...**\n- The assumption \"plane strain\" is physically incorrect for a thin, unconstrained plate.\n- The provided constitutive relations are the ones for plane stress, not plane strain. This creates an internal contradiction within the option.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Adopt plane stress; use the reduced isotropic linear elastic relations ...**\n- The assumption \"plane stress\" is correct.\n- The provided constitutive relations are:\n  $$ \\sigma_{xx} = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu}\\left(\\varepsilon_{xx} + \\nu \\varepsilon_{yy}\\right) $$\n  $$ \\sigma_{yy} = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu}\\left(\\varepsilon_{yy} + \\nu \\varepsilon_{xx}\\right) $$\n  $$ \\tau_{xy} = \\frac{E}{2(1-\\nu)}\\,\\gamma_{xy} $$\n- The factor $\\frac{E}{1-\\nu}$ is the biaxial modulus, which is not the correct pre-factor for the general plane stress case. The correct pre-factor for normal stresses is $\\frac{E}{1-\\nu^2}$. The shear modulus is also incorrectly stated as $\\frac{E}{2(1-\\nu)}$; the correct shear modulus is $G = \\frac{E}{2(1+\\nu)}$. The relations are mathematically incorrect.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Adopt plane strain; use the reduced isotropic linear elastic relations ...**\n- The assumption \"plane strain\" is physically incorrect for this problem.\n- The provided constitutive relations are, in fact, the correct relations for a state of plane strain. However, since the underlying assumption is inappropriate for a thin wafer, this option is not the correct model for the physical system described.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the analysis, Option A is the only choice that correctly identifies both the appropriate physical modeling assumption (plane stress) and the correct mathematical formulation of the corresponding constitutive laws.",

It presents a standard problem in thin-film mechanics with physically plausible parameters and asks for a derivation and calculation based on fundamental principles of linear elasticity and plate theory, followed by a standard uncertainty analysis. All necessary information is provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution will be provided.\n\nThe primary task is to derive the relationship between the intrinsic stress in a thin film, $\\sigma_f$, and the curvature, $k$, it induces in a much thicker substrate. This relationship is famously known as the Stoney equation. The derivation begins from the principles of classical plate theory and linear elasticity, under several key idealizations:\n1.  The film is significantly thinner than the substrate, i.e., $t_f \\ll t_s$. This allows us to neglect the flexural rigidity of the film itself and to assume the neutral bending plane of the composite structure lies at the mid-plane of the substrate.\n2.  The substrate is treated as a homogeneous, isotropic, linear elastic plate.\n3.  Deformations are small, consistent with the assumptions of linear elasticity.\n4.  The film possesses a uniform, equi-biaxial stress $\\sigma_f$.\n5.  The induced curvature $k$ is uniform across the wafer.\n\nLet the substrate have thickness $t_s$, Young's modulus $E_s$, and Poisson's ratio $\\nu_s$. Let the film have thickness $t_f$. The equi-biaxial stress $\\sigma_f$ in the film exerts a force per unit length, $F'$, on the substrate at the interface, given by $F' = \\sigma_f t_f$.\n\nThis force acts at the interface, but the substrate bends about its neutral axis, which, due to the $t_f \\ll t_s$ approximation, is located at the center of the substrate, a distance of $t_s/2$ from the interface. This force thus creates a bending moment per unit length, $M'$, in the substrate:\n$$\nM' = F' \\cdot \\frac{t_s}{2} = (\\sigma_f t_f) \\frac{t_s}{2}\n$$\nAccording to classical plate theory for an isotropic material under equi-biaxial bending ($k_x = k_y = k$), the relationship between the applied moment per unit length, $M'$, and the resulting curvature, $k$, is:\n$$\nM' = D k (1 + \\nu_s)\n$$\nwhere $D$ is the flexural rigidity of the plate, defined as:\n$$\nD = \\frac{E_s t_s^3}{12(1-\\nu_s^2)}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $D$ into the moment-curvature relation:\n$$\nM' = \\frac{E_s t_s^3}{12(1-\\nu_s^2)} k (1 + \\nu_s) = \\frac{E_s t_s^3 k (1 + \\nu_s)}{12(1-\\nu_s)(1+\\nu_s)} = \\frac{E_s t_s^3 k}{12(1-\\nu_s)}\n$$\nNow, we equate the two expressions for the bending moment $M'$:\n$$\n(\\sigma_f t_f) \\frac{t_s}{2} = \\frac{E_s t_s^3 k}{12(1-\\nu_s)}\n$$\nSolving for the film stress $\\sigma_f$, we obtain the Stoney equation:\n$$\n\\sigma_f = \\frac{E_s t_s^2 k}{6(1-\\nu_s)t_f}\n$$\nThis is the required relationship.

            "solution": "The problem statement has been analyzed and is determined to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of continuum mechanics and semiconductor physics, is mathematically well-posed, and provides a self-contained and unambiguous set of data and requirements. We may therefore proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution is developed in four parts as required: a) derivation of the stress update rule, b) derivation of the mobility model, c) formulation of the computational algorithm, and d) application to the specified test cases.\n\na) Derivation of the Stress Update Rule\n\nThe evolution of the internal uniaxial stress, $\\sigma_{x}$, is governed by the first-order linear ordinary differential equation:\n$$\n\\frac{d \\sigma_{x}}{dt} = - \\frac{\\sigma_{x} - \\sigma_{\\mathrm{app}}}{\\tau(T)}\n$$\nFor a single process step, the temperature $T$ and the externally applied stress $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{app}}$ are constant. Consequently, the relaxation time $\\tau(T)$ is also constant over the duration of the step, $\\Delta t$. We can rewrite the equation as:\n$$\n\\frac{d \\sigma_{x}}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau} \\sigma_{x} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{app}}}{\\tau}\n$$\nThis is a standard non-homogeneous linear first-order differential equation. Its solution can be found using an integrating factor, $I(t) = \\exp(\\int \\frac{dt}{\\tau}) = \\exp(t/\\tau)$. Multiplying the equation by $I(t)$ yields:\n$$\n\\exp(t/\\tau) \\frac{d \\sigma_{x}}{dt} + \\frac{1}{\\tau} \\exp(t/\\tau) \\sigma_{x} = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{app}}}{\\tau} \\exp(t/\\tau)\n$$\nThe left-hand side is the derivative of a product, $\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\sigma_{x}(t) \\exp(t/\\tau) \\right)$. Thus:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\sigma_{x}(t) \\exp(t/\\tau) \\right) = \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{app}}}{\\tau} \\exp(t/\\tau)\n$$\nWe integrate over a time interval from $t=0$ to $t=\\Delta t$, corresponding to the start and end of the process step. Let the stress at the start of the step be $\\sigma_{x, \\text{start}}$.\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\Delta t} \\frac{d}{dt} \\left( \\sigma_{x}(t) \\exp(t/\\tau) \\right) dt = \\int_{0}^{\\Delta t} \\frac{\\sigma_{\\mathrm{app}}}{\\tau} \\exp(t/\\tau) dt\n$$\n$$\n\\left[ \\sigma_{x}(t) \\exp(t/\\tau) \\right]_{0}^{\\Delta t} = \\left[ \\sigma_{\\mathrm{app}} \\exp(t/\\tau) \\right]_{0}^{\\Delta t}\n$$\n$$\n\\sigma_{x}(\\Delta t) \\exp(\\Delta t/\\tau) - \\sigma_{x}(0) \\exp(0) = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{app}} \\exp(\\Delta t/\\tau) - \\sigma_{\\mathrm{app}} \\exp(0)\n$$\nLetting $\\sigma_{x, \\text{end}} = \\sigma_{x}(\\Delta t)$ and $\\sigma_{x, \\text{start}} = \\sigma_{x}(0)$, we have:\n$$\n\\sigma_{x, \\text{end}} \\exp(\\Delta t/\\tau) - \\sigma_{x, \\text{start}} = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{app}} (\\exp(\\Delta t/\\tau) - 1)\n$$\nSolving for $\\sigma_{x, \\text{end}}$ by multiplying through by $\\exp(-\\Delta t/\\tau)$:\n$$\n\\sigma_{x, \\text{end}} = \\sigma_{x, \\text{start}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau}\\right) + \\sigma_{\\mathrm{app}} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau}\\right)\\right)\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged into a numerically stable and physically intuitive form. It describes the final stress as a convex combination of the initial and applied stresses, weighted by the exponential decay factor. A more common form is:\n$$\n\\sigma_{x, \\text{end}} = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{app}} + (\\sigma_{x, \\text{start}} - \\sigma_{\\mathrm{app}}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau(T)}\\right)\n$$\nHere, the relaxation time $\\tau(T)$ follows the Arrhenius law:\n$$\n\\tau(T) = \\tau_{0} \\exp\\left(\\frac{E_{a}}{k_{B} T}\\right)\n$$\nwith constants $\\tau_0 = 1.0\\times 10^{-7}$ s, $E_a = 1.5$ eV, and $k_B = 8.617333262145\\times 10^{-5}$ eV/K. This update rule propagates the stress state across one discrete process step.\n\nb) Derivation of the Mobility Model\n\nThe problem posits that for small stresses, the scalar electron mobility $\\mu_{n}$ can be expressed as a first-order expansion in the invariants of the Cauchy stress tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$. The chosen invariants are the hydrostatic stress, $\\sigma_{h}$, and the square root of the second invariant of the deviatoric stress, $\\sqrt{J_2}$. The general first-order model for the relative change in mobility is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mu_{n} - \\mu_{n,0}}{\\mu_{n,0}} = a_{h}^{(n)} \\sigma_{h} + a_{d}^{(n)} \\sqrt{J_{2}}\n$$\nwhere $\\mu_{n,0}$ is the reference mobility at zero stress, and $a_{h}^{(n)}$ and $a_{d}^{(n)}$ are the hydrostatic and distortional piezomobility coefficients, given as $a_{h}^{(n)} = 1.0\\times 10^{-11}$ Pa$^{-1}$ and $a_{d}^{(n)} = 2.0\\times 10^{-11}$ Pa$^{-1}$.\n\nThis gives the mobility as:\n$$\n\\mu_{n}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = \\mu_{n,0} \\left( 1 + a_{h}^{(n)} \\sigma_{h} + a_{d}^{(n)} \\sqrt{J_{2}} \\right)\n$$\nWe must now evaluate the invariants for the specified uniaxial stress state, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\mathrm{diag}(\\sigma_{x}, 0, 0)$.\n\nThe hydrostatic stress is a third of the trace of the stress tensor:\n$$\n\\sigma_{h} = \\frac{1}{3} \\mathrm{tr}(\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}) = \\frac{1}{3} (\\sigma_{x} + 0 + 0) = \\frac{\\sigma_{x}}{3}\n$$\nThe deviatoric stress tensor $\\mathbf{s}$ is defined as $\\mathbf{s} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} - \\sigma_{h}\\mathbf{I}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{s} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_{x}  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  0 \\end{pmatrix} - \\frac{\\sigma_{x}}{3} \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  0 \\\\ 0  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 2\\sigma_{x}/3  0  0 \\\\ 0  -\\sigma_{x}/3  0 \\\\ 0  0  -\\sigma_{x}/3 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe second invariant $J_2$ is given by $J_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbf{s}:\\mathbf{s} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i,j} s_{ij}s_{ji}$. For a diagonal tensor, this simplifies to $J_2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i} s_{ii}^2$:\n$$\nJ_2 = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{2\\sigma_{x}}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{\\sigma_{x}}{3}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{\\sigma_{x}}{3}\\right)^2 \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{4\\sigma_{x}^2}{9} + \\frac{\\sigma_{x}^2}{9} + \\frac{\\sigma_{x}^2}{9} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{6\\sigma_{x}^2}{9} \\right) = \\frac{\\sigma_{x}^2}{3}\n$$\nTherefore, the square root of this invariant is:\n$$\n\\sqrt{J_2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_{x}^2}{3}} = \\frac{|\\sigma_{x}|}{\\sqrt{3}}\n$$\nBoth invariants are consistent with the values provided in the problem statement. Substituting these expressions into the mobility equation yields the final model for electron mobility as a function of the uniaxial stress $\\sigma_x$:\n$$\n\\mu_{n}(\\sigma_{x}) = \\mu_{n,0} \\left( 1 + a_{h}^{(n)} \\frac{\\sigma_{x}}{3} + a_{d}^{(n)} \\frac{|\\sigma_{x}|}{\\sqrt{3}} \\right)\n$$\nThis expression will be used to compute the final mobility from the final stress state.\n\nc) Algorithmic Design\n\nThe algorithm to compute the final electron mobility for a given test case proceeds as follows:\n1.  Initialize the state variable for internal stress, $\\sigma_{x,\\text{current}}$, with the provided initial stress, $\\sigma_{x}(0)$.\n2.  Iterate through the sequence of process steps, where each step $i$ is defined by a tuple $(T_i, \\Delta t_i, \\sigma_{\\mathrm{app}, i})$.\n3.  For each step $i$:\n    a. Retrieve the step parameters $T_i$, $\\Delta t_i$, and $\\sigma_{\\mathrm{app}, i}$.\n    b. Calculate the relaxation time $\\tau(T_i)$ using the Arrhenius equation: $\\tau(T_i) = \\tau_{0} \\exp(E_{a} / (k_{B} T_i))$.\n    c. Apply the derived update rule to find the stress at the end of the step, $\\sigma_{x, \\text{end}}$. The initial stress for this step is the final stress from the previous step, $\\sigma_{x, \\text{current}}$.\n       $$ \\sigma_{x, \\text{end}} = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{app}, i} + (\\sigma_{x, \\text{current}} - \\sigma_{\\mathrm{app}, i}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t_i}{\\tau(T_i)}\\right) $$\n    d. Update the state variable for the next iteration: $\\sigma_{x,\\text{current}} \\leftarrow \\sigma_{x, \\text{end}}$.\n4.  After processing all steps, the final internal stress is $\\sigma_{x,\\text{final}} = \\sigma_{x,\\text{current}}$.\n5.  Use the final stress $\\sigma_{x,\\text{final}}$ to compute the final electron mobility $\\mu_{n,\\text{final}}$ using the derived mobility model:\n    $$ \\mu_{n,\\text{final}} = \\mu_{n,0} \\left( 1 + a_{h}^{(n)} \\frac{\\sigma_{x,\\text{final}}}{3} + a_{d}^{(n)} \\frac{|\\sigma_{x,\\text{final}}|}{\\sqrt{3}} \\right) $$\n6.  The result, $\\mu_{n,\\text{final}}$, is then formatted to the required precision.\n\nd) Implementation and Validation\n\nThe above algorithm is implemented in a Python program. This program sequentially processes each of the four specified test cases. For each case, it initializes the stress, iteratively applies the per-step update rule to propagate the stress state through the process flow, and finally computes the electron mobility from the final stress. The numerical constants provided in the problem statement ($\\mu_{n,0} = 0.045$ m$^2$/V·s, $a_{h}^{(n)}$, $a_{d}^{(n)}$, $\\tau_{0}$, $E_{a}$, $k_{B}$) are used directly in the calculations. The output is a list of the final mobility values, rounded to eight decimal places, for each test case.",
