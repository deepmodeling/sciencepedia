We may proceed to the solution.\n\n**Derivation of In-plane Stress $\\sigma_{\\parallel}$ and Effective Elastic Constants**\n\nWe establish a coordinate system where the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes are aligned with the $[100]$, $[010]$, and $[001]$ crystallographic directions, respectively. The film lies in the $x$-$y$ plane.\n\nFor a cubic crystal, the stress-strain relationship (Hooke's law) in Voigt notation is given by:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_1 \\\\ \\sigma_2 \\\\ \\sigma_3 \\\\ \\sigma_4 \\\\ \\sigma_5 \\\\ \\sigma_6 \\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\nC_{11}  C_{12}  C_{12}  0  0  0 \\\\\nC_{12}  C_{11}  C_{12}  0  0  0 \\\\\nC_{12}  C_{12}  C_{11}  0  0  0 \\\\\n0  0  0  C_{44}  0  0 \\\\\n0  0  0  0  C_{44}  0 \\\\\n0  0  0  0  0  C_{44}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\epsilon_1 \\\\ \\epsilon_2 \\\\ \\epsilon_3 \\\\ \\epsilon_4 \\\\ \\epsilon_5 \\\\ \\epsilon_6 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nHere, the indices $1, 2, 3$ correspond to $xx, yy, zz$ components.\n\nThe conditions of the problem are:\n1.  **Pseudomorphic growth:** The in-plane strain of the film is determined by the lattice mismatch $f$ with the substrate. For a cubic crystal on a (001) substrate, the strain is equibiaxial:\n    $$ \\epsilon_1 = \\epsilon_{xx} = f $$\n    $$ \\epsilon_2 = \\epsilon_{yy} = f $$\n2.  **No in-plane shear:** By orientation, the shear strains in the film plane are zero. The out-of-plane shear strains are also zero due to the constraints.\n    $$ \\epsilon_4 = \\epsilon_5 = \\epsilon_6 = 0 $$\n3.  **Plane-stress condition:** The film is thin with a free surface normal to the $z$-axis, so the stress component in this direction is zero:\n    $$ \\sigma_3 = \\sigma_{zz} = 0 $$\n\nWe first determine the strain in the $z$-direction, $\\epsilon_3$. From the third row of the Hooke's law matrix equation:\n$$ \\sigma_3 = C_{12} \\epsilon_1 + C_{12} \\epsilon_2 + C_{11} \\epsilon_3 = 0 $$\nSubstituting the known strains $\\epsilon_1 = f$ and $\\epsilon_2 = f$:\n$$ C_{12} f + C_{12} f + C_{11} \\epsilon_3 = 0 $$\n$$ 2 C_{12} f + C_{11} \\epsilon_3 = 0 $$\nSolving for $\\epsilon_3$:\n$$ \\epsilon_3 = -\\frac{2 C_{12}}{C_{11}} f $$\n\nNext, we find the in-plane stress. Due to the symmetrical biaxial strain in the (001) plane, the in-plane stresses are equal: $\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_2 = \\sigma_{\\parallel}$. Using the first row of the Hooke's law matrix:\n$$ \\sigma_1 = \\sigma_{\\parallel} = C_{11} \\epsilon_1 + C_{12} \\epsilon_2 + C_{12} \\epsilon_3 $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the strains:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\parallel} = C_{11} f + C_{12} f + C_{12} \\left( -\\frac{2 C_{12}}{C_{11}} f \\right) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\parallel} = \\left( C_{11} + C_{12} - \\frac{2 C_{12}^2}{C_{11}} \\right) f $$\nFactoring this expression by putting it over a common denominator $C_{11}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\parallel} = \\left( \\frac{C_{11}^2 + C_{11} C_{12} - 2 C_{12}^2}{C_{11}} \\right) f $$\nThe numerator can be factored as $(C_{11} - C_{12})(C_{11} + 2 C_{12})$. Thus, the in-plane stress is:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\parallel} = \\frac{(C_{11} - C_{12})(C_{11} + 2 C_{12})}{C_{11}} f $$\nThe term multiplying $f$ is the biaxial modulus for the (001) plane, $M_{(001)}$.\n\nNow, we derive the effective in-plane elastic constants. The effective Young's modulus $E_{\\text{eff}}$ and Poisson's ratio $\\nu_{\\text{eff}}$ for the (001) orientation are typically defined for uniaxial stress along a principal direction in that plane, e.g., $[100]$. To find these, we consider the compliance matrix $S$, the inverse of the stiffness matrix $C$. The relevant strain-stress relations are $\\epsilon_i = S_{ij} \\sigma_j$.\nFor a uniaxial stress $\\sigma_1 = \\sigma_{xx}$ applied in the plane (with $\\sigma_2 = \\sigma_3 = 0$):\n$$ \\epsilon_1 = S_{11} \\sigma_1 $$\n$$ \\epsilon_2 = S_{12} \\sigma_1 $$\nThe effective Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are defined as:\n$$ E_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{\\sigma_1}{\\epsilon_1} = \\frac{1}{S_{11}} $$\n$$ \\nu_{\\text{eff}} = -\\frac{\\epsilon_2}{\\epsilon_1} = -\\frac{S_{12} \\sigma_1}{S_{11} \\sigma_1} = -\\frac{S_{12}}{S_{11}} $$\nTo find $S_{11}$ and $S_{12}$, we invert the $3 \\times 3$ normal-stress part of the stiffness matrix. The inversion yields:\n$$ S_{11} = \\frac{C_{11} + C_{12}}{(C_{11} - C_{12})(C_{11} + 2 C_{12})} $$\n$$ S_{12} = \\frac{-C_{12}}{(C_{11} - C_{12})(C_{11} + 2 C_{12})} $$\nUsing these, we derive $E_{\\text{eff}}$ and $\\nu_{\\text{eff}}$:\n$$ E_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{1}{S_{11}} = \\frac{(C_{11} - C_{12})(C_{11} + 2 C_{12})}{C_{11} + C_{12}} $$\n$$ \\nu_{\\text{eff}} = -\\frac{S_{12}}{S_{11}} = - \\frac{-C_{12} / (...)}{(C_{11} + C_{12}) / (...)} = \\frac{C_{12}}{C_{11} + C_{12}} $$\n\nThe problem asks to express $\\sigma_{\\parallel}$ using these effective parameters. For an isotropic material, the biaxial stress is given by $\\sigma = \\frac{E}{1-\\nu} \\epsilon$. Let's test if this form holds for our effective anisotropic parameters:\n$$ \\frac{E_{\\text{eff}}}{1 - \\nu_{\\text{eff}}} = \\frac{\\frac{(C_{11} - C_{12})(C_{11} + 2 C_{12})}{C_{11} + C_{12}}}{1 - \\frac{C_{12}}{C_{11} + C_{12}}} = \\frac{\\frac{(C_{11} - C_{12})(C_{11} + 2 C_{12})}{C_{11} + C_{12}}}{\\frac{C_{11} + C_{12} - C_{12}}{C_{11} + C_{12}}}\n= \\frac{\\frac{(C_{11} - C_{12})(C_{11} + 2 C_{12})}{C_{11} + C_{12}}}{\\frac{C_{11}}{C_{11} + C_{12}}} $$\n$$ \\frac{E_{\\text{eff}}}{1 - \\nu_{\\text{eff}}} = \\frac{(C_{11} - C_{12})(C_{11} + 2 C_{12})}{C_{11}} = M_{(001)} $$\nThis confirms that the biaxial modulus is indeed represented by $\\frac{E_{\\text{eff}}}{1 - \\nu_{\\text{eff}}}$, and the stress is thus given by:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\parallel} = \\frac{E_{\\text{eff}}}{1 - \\nu_{\\text{eff}}} f = \\frac{(C_{11} - C_{12})(C_{11} + 2 C_{12})}{C_{11}} f $$\n\n**Numerical Evaluation for GaAs**\n\nWe are given:\n- $C_{11} = 118.8~\\text{GPa}$\n- $C_{12} = 53.8~\\text{GPa}$\n- Misfit strain $f = 7.2 \\times 10^{-3}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the biaxial modulus $M_{(001)}$:\n$$ M_{(001)} = \\frac{(118.8 - 53.8)(118.8 + 2 \\times 53.8)}{118.8} $$\n$$ M_{(001)} = \\frac{(65.0)(118.8 + 107.6)}{118.8} = \\frac{(65.0)(226.4)}{118.8} $$\n$$ M_{(001)} = \\frac{14716}{118.8} \\approx 123.87205~\\text{GPa} $$\nNow, we calculate the in-plane stress $\\sigma_{\\parallel}$:\n$$ \\sigma_{\\parallel} = M_{(001)} \\times f = (123.87205~\\text{GPa}) \\times (7.2 \\times 10^{-3}) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{\\parallel} \\approx 0.8918787...~\\text{GPa} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ \\sigma_{\\parallel} \\approx 0.8919~\\text{GPa} $$\nThe positive sign indicates that the stress is tensile, which is consistent with a positive misfit strain (where the film's natural lattice constant is larger than the substrate's).",

We can solve for $\\theta$:\n$$\n\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\mathbf{v}_b \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_l}{|\\mathbf{v}_b| |\\mathbf{v}_l|}\n$$\nFirst, we compute the dot product:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}_b \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_l = (1)(1) + (0)(1) + (1)(0) = 1\n$$\nNext, we compute the magnitudes of the direction vectors:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{v}_b| = \\sqrt{1^2 + 0^2 + 1^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 0 + 1} = \\sqrt{2}\n$$\n$$\n|\\mathbf{v}_l| = \\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 0^2} = \\sqrt{1 + 1 + 0} = \\sqrt{2}\n$$\nNow, we substitute these values back into the equation for $\\cos(\\theta)$:\n$$\n\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThe angle $\\theta$ is the arccosine of this value:\n$$\n\\theta = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 60^{\\circ}\n$$\nBy definition, a dislocation where the angle between the Burgers vector and the line direction is $60^{\\circ}$ is called a $60^{\\circ}$ dislocation. It is a type of mixed dislocation, possessing both edge and screw character. An edge-type dislocation would have $\\theta=90^{\\circ}$, and a screw-type would have $\\theta=0^{\\circ}$ or $\\theta=180^{\\circ}$.\n\nPart 2: Discussion of strain relaxation efficiency.\nThe relaxation of misfit strain at an interface occurs due to the component of the Burgers vector that is of edge character and lies within the interface plane. This is often termed the \"effective Burgers vector\", $\\mathbf{b}_{eff}$, for strain relief.\n\nLet's analyze the given $60^{\\circ}$ dislocation.\nThe Burgers vector is $\\mathbf{b} = \\frac{a}{2}[101]$. The interface is the $(001)$ plane. We can decompose $\\mathbf{b}$ into a component parallel to the interface, $\\mathbf{b}_{plane}$, and a component perpendicular to it, $\\mathbf{b}_{\\perp}$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{b} = \\mathbf{b}_{plane} + \\mathbf{b}_{\\perp} = \\frac{a}{2}[100] + \\frac{a}{2}[001]\n$$\nOnly the in-plane component, $\\mathbf{b}_{plane} = \\frac{a}{2}[100]$, can relieve the biaxial misfit strain in the $(001)$ plane. The perpendicular component, $\\mathbf{b}_{\\perp}$, creates a crystal tilt but does not relieve misfit.\n\nHowever, not all of $\\mathbf{b}_{plane}$ is effective. The misfit strain is relieved by the edge component of the dislocation, which, by definition, is the part of the Burgers vector perpendicular to the dislocation line $\\mathbf{l}$. The dislocation line direction is $\\mathbf{l} \\parallel [110]$, which lies in the $(001)$ interface plane. The effective Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b}_{eff}$ is the component of $\\mathbf{b}_{plane}$ that is perpendicular to $\\mathbf{l}$.\n\nThe magnitude of this effective component can be found by removing the projection of $\\mathbf{b}_{plane}$ onto $\\mathbf{l}$. Let $\\phi$ be the angle between $\\mathbf{b}_{plane}$ and $\\mathbf{l}$.\n$$\n\\cos(\\phi) = \\frac{\\mathbf{b}_{plane} \\cdot \\mathbf{l}}{|\\mathbf{b}_{plane}| |\\mathbf{l}|} = \\frac{(\\frac{a}{2}[100]) \\cdot [110]}{|\\frac{a}{2}[100]| |[110]|} = \\frac{\\frac{a}{2}(1)}{\\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)\\left(\\sqrt{2}\\right)} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nThe magnitude of the effective edge component is $|\\mathbf{b}_{eff}| = |\\mathbf{b}_{plane}|\\sin(\\phi)$. Since $\\sin(\\phi) = \\sqrt{1-\\cos^2(\\phi)} = \\sqrt{1 - (1/\\sqrt{2})^2} = \\sqrt{1/2} = 1/\\sqrt{2}$, we have:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{b}_{eff}|_{60^{\\circ}} = \\left|\\frac{a}{2}[100]\\right| \\sin(\\phi) = \\frac{a}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{a}{2\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{a\\sqrt{2}}{4}\n$$\nSo, for the $60^{\\circ}$ dislocation, the magnitude of the Burgers vector component that relieves misfit strain is $\\frac{a\\sqrt{2}}{4}$.\n\nNow, we compare this to a pure edge ($90^{\\circ}$) misfit dislocation at the same interface. A common pure edge dislocation in this system is the Lomer dislocation, which has a Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b} = \\frac{a}{2}[1\\bar{1}0]$ and a line direction $\\mathbf{l} = [110]$.\nLet's verify it is a pure edge dislocation:\n$$\n\\mathbf{b} \\cdot \\mathbf{l} = \\left(\\frac{a}{2}[1\\bar{1}0]\\right) \\cdot [110] = \\frac{a}{2}(1 \\cdot 1 + (-1) \\cdot 1 + 0 \\cdot 0) = 0\n$$\nSince the dot product is zero, the angle is $\\theta=90^{\\circ}$, confirming it is a pure edge dislocation.\nFor this dislocation, the entire Burgers vector $\\mathbf{b} = \\frac{a}{2}[1\\bar{1}0]$ lies within the $(001)$ interface plane ($\\mathbf{b}_{\\perp}=0$). Furthermore, the entire vector is perpendicular to the line direction $\\mathbf{l}$. Therefore, the entire Burgers vector is effective for strain relief.\nThe magnitude of this effective Burgers vector is:\n$$\n|\\mathbf{b}_{eff}|_{90^{\\circ}} = |\\mathbf{b}| = \\left|\\frac{a}{2}[1\\bar{1}0]\\right| = \\frac{a}{2}\\sqrt{1^2+(-1)^2+0^2} = \\frac{a\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n$$\nComparing the efficiencies, we find the ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{|\\mathbf{b}_{eff}|_{60^{\\circ}}}{|\\mathbf{b}_{eff}|_{90^{\\circ}}} = \\frac{a\\sqrt{2}/4}{a\\sqrt{2}/2} = \\frac{1}{2}\n$$\nThe $60^{\\circ}$ dislocation is only half as efficient at relieving in-plane misfit strain as a pure edge dislocation. This is because, from first principles, a significant portion of its Burgers vector is \"wasted\": the $\\frac{a}{2}[001]$ component is perpendicular to the interface and only causes tilt, while the component of $\\frac{a}{2}[100]$ that is parallel to the dislocation line manifests as a screw component, which does not contribute to misfit relief. The pure edge dislocation, by contrast, has its entire Burgers vector optimally oriented within the interface and perpendicular to the dislocation line, making it maximally efficient for strain relaxation.",
