The plan is to extract the ion drift speed at the sheath edge from Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF) and to infer the ion-acoustic speed from the Electron Energy Distribution Function (EEDF) measured by a radio-frequency compensated Langmuir probe. The plasma is argon, so the dominant ion is singly charged argon with mass $m_i = 6.63 \\times 10^{-26} \\ \\mathrm{kg}$. You tune the LIF laser across an argon ion transition of vacuum wavelength $\\lambda_0 = 668.614 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$ and record fluorescence with line-of-sight along the sheath normal at the electrode. At the spatial location identified as the sheath edge via an emissive probe, the LIF spectrum yields a mean Doppler detuning corresponding to a wavelength shift $\\Delta \\lambda = -7.1 \\ \\mathrm{pm}$, and a Gaussian velocity spread consistent with an ion temperature $T_i = 0.10 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$.

Use Doppler-resolved LIF on an argon ion transition at the sheath edge to obtain the ion velocity distribution function (IVDF) along the sheath normal. Map laser detuning to velocity via $v = c \\, \\Delta \\lambda / \\lambda_0$ and compute the bulk drift as the first moment $u_i = \\int v f_i(v) \\, dv / \\int f_i(v) \\, dv$ localized at the sheath edge; estimate $T_i$ from the Gaussian width. From the EEDF, compute an effective electron temperature $T_e = (2/3) \\langle \\varepsilon \\rangle$ and use isothermal electron and ion closures to infer $c_s = \\sqrt{ \\dfrac{k_B (T_e + T_i)}{m_i} }$. With the given numbers, $u_i \\approx 3.19 \\times 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}$ and $c_s \\approx 2.65 \\times 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}$, so $u_i \\ge c_s$ and the Bohm condition is satisfied.\n\nB.

            "solution": "The problem is scientifically sound, presenting a realistic experimental scenario to test a fundamental plasma physics principle. All data and assumptions are provided and are self-consistent, making the problem well-posed and valid for a detailed solution.\n\nThe objective is to test the Bohm criterion, which states that for a stable, collisionless sheath to form, ions must enter the sheath from the presheath with a drift velocity $u_i$ that is at least equal to the ion-acoustic speed $c_s$. The generalized condition is $u_i \\ge c_s$.\n\n**1. Calculation of the Ion Drift Speed ($u_i$)**\n\nThe ion drift speed is measured using LIF. The mean drift speed along the laser line-of-sight corresponds to the mean Doppler shift of the fluorescence spectrum. The non-relativistic Doppler shift formula relates the observed wavelength shift $\\Delta \\lambda$ to the velocity $v$ via $v/c = \\Delta \\lambda / \\lambda_0$. The problem specifies a mean wavelength shift $\\Delta \\lambda = -7.1 \\ \\mathrm{pm}$ for an ion transition with rest wavelength $\\lambda_0 = 668.614 \\ \\mathrm{nm}$. The speed $u_i$ is the magnitude of this velocity.\n\n$$u_i = c \\frac{|\\Delta \\lambda|}{\\lambda_0}$$\n$$u_i = (2.99792458 \\times 10^8 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}) \\frac{7.1 \\times 10^{-12} \\ \\mathrm{m}}{668.614 \\times 10^{-9} \\ \\mathrm{m}}$$\n$$u_i \\approx 3185.73 \\ \\mathrm{m/s} \\approx 3.19 \\times 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}$$\n\n**2. Calculation of the Ion-Acoustic Speed ($c_s$)**\n\nThe ion-acoustic speed depends on the properties of both electrons and ions. The problem specifies that both species should be treated as isothermal fluids near the sheath edge. For a plasma with warm, isothermal ions (polytropic index $\\gamma_i = 1$) and isothermal electrons ($\\gamma_e = 1$), the ion-acoustic speed for singly-charged ions ($Z=1$) is given by:\n$$c_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_B T_e + \\gamma_i k_B T_i}{m_i}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_B(T_e + T_i)}{m_i}}$$\nWe are given the ion temperature in energy units, $k_B T_i = 0.10 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$.\nThe electron temperature $T_e$ must be inferred from the mean electron energy $\\langle \\varepsilon \\rangle = 4.2 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$. For a general EEDF in three dimensions, the mean energy is related to the effective temperature $T_e$ used in fluid models by $\\langle \\varepsilon \\rangle = \\frac{3}{2} k_B T_e$. This relation correctly links the kinetic definition of temperature to the pressure term in the fluid momentum equation.\n$$k_B T_e = \\frac{2}{3} \\langle \\varepsilon \\rangle = \\frac{2}{3} (4.2 \\ \\mathrm{eV}) = 2.8 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$$\nNow, we can calculate $c_s$. First, we find the total thermal energy in Joules. The conversion is $1 \\ \\mathrm{eV} \\approx 1.602177 \\times 10^{-19} \\ \\mathrm{J}$.\n$$k_B(T_e + T_i) = (2.8 + 0.10) \\ \\mathrm{eV} = 2.9 \\ \\mathrm{eV}$$\n$$k_B(T_e + T_i) = 2.9 \\ \\mathrm{eV} \\times (1.602176634 \\times 10^{-19} \\ \\mathrm{J/eV}) \\approx 4.6463 \\times 10^{-19} \\ \\mathrm{J}$$\n$$c_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{4.6463 \\times 10^{-19} \\ \\mathrm{J}}{6.63 \\times 10^{-26} \\ \\mathrm{kg}}} \\approx \\sqrt{6.9929 \\times 10^6 \\ \\mathrm{m^2/s^2}}$$\n$$c_s \\approx 2644.4 \\ \\mathrm{m/s} \\approx 2.64 \\times 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}$$\n\n**3. Testing the Bohm Criterion**\n\nComparing the calculated speeds:\n$u_i \\approx 3.19 \\times 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}$\n$c_s \\approx 2.64 \\times 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}$\nSince $u_i > c_s$, the Bohm criterion $u_i \\ge c_s$ is satisfied by the experimental data.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A.** This option correctly describes the entire procedure. It uses the correct Doppler formula for $u_i$. It correctly relates the EEDF mean energy to an effective temperature via $k_B T_e = (2/3)\\langle \\varepsilon \\rangle$. It uses the correct formula for the ion-acoustic speed for warm, isothermal ions, $c_s = \\sqrt{k_B(T_e+T_i)/m_i}$. The numerical calculations are correct ($u_i \\approx 3.19 \\times 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}$, and $c_s \\approx 2.65 \\times 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}$ is a reasonably rounded value of our calculated $2.64 \\times 10^3 \\ \\mathrm{m/s}$). The final conclusion that $u_i \\ge c_s$ is correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B.** This option contains a fundamental error in the definition of the ion-acoustic speed. The formula $c_s = \\sqrt{k_B T_e / m_e}$ involves the electron mass $m_e$ and represents the electron thermal speed, which is orders of magnitude larger than the ion-acoustic speed. The ion-acoustic speed is determined by ion inertia, hence it must involve the ion mass $m_i$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C.** This option has three major errors. First, the Bohm criterion is a boundary condition at the sheath edge; measuring $u_i$ \"well inside the sheath\" is methodologically incorrect for testing this criterion. Second, the definition of electron temperature as $k_B T_e = \\langle \\varepsilon \\rangle$ is incorrect for a 3D system; the correct relation is $k_B T_e = (2/3)\\langle \\varepsilon \\rangle$. Third, the formula for $c_s$ neglects the ion temperature $T_i$, which is explicitly given in the problem and assumed to be relevant (isothermal ion closure).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D.** This option is incorrect for several reasons. It proposes using an entirely different experimental technique (RFEA) than that specified in the problem (LIF). More critically, it proposes measuring the ion properties at the wall/electrode, not the sheath edge. Ions accelerate through the sheath, so their velocity at the wall is much greater than at the sheath edge. Using this wall velocity to test the sheath-edge Bohm criterion is a fundamental mistake. Additionally, like option C, it uses the simplified \"cold ion\" formula for $c_s$, ignoring the provided $T_i$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**",

            "solution": "The problem statement is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It describes a standard, albeit simplified, model of a capacitively coupled radio-frequency (RF) sheath, which is a cornerstone of plasma processing models in semiconductor manufacturing. The givens and assumptions are self-consistent and sufficient to derive a unique, meaningful solution. The problem is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe solution is presented in three parts, corresponding to the tasks outlined in the problem statement.\n\n1. Explanation of Sheath Edge Ambiguity and Time-Average Relevance\n\nIn a plasma, the sheath is the non-neutral boundary layer that forms between the quasi-neutral bulk plasma and a material surface. The sheath edge is the boundary separating these two regions. In a direct current (DC) discharge, the sheath structure is stationary, and a well-defined, time-invariant sheath edge exists at a fixed spatial coordinate.\n\nHowever, in an RF discharge, the sheath is dynamic. The potential at the electrode, and thus the sheath potential drop $V_s(t) = V_{0} + V_{1} \\cos(\\omega t)$, oscillates rapidly in time. Electrons, having a very small mass, can respond almost instantaneously to the oscillating electric field. When the sheath potential $V_s(t)$ is at its minimum, the sheath electric field is weakest, and the sheath contracts as electrons are able to approach the electrode more closely. Conversely, when $V_s(t)$ is at its maximum, the sheath field is strongest, repelling electrons far from the electrode and causing the sheath to expand.\n\nConsequently, the instantaneous position $s(t)$ where charge neutrality breaks down (i.e., where the electron density $n_e(x,t)$ significantly deviates from the ion density $n_i(x,t)$) is an oscillating function of time. Any formal definition of the sheath edge—for example, the location where $n_e = 0.5 n_i$, or where the local potential curvature exceeds a certain threshold, or where ions first satisfy the Bohm criterion—will yield a time-dependent position $s(t)$. This inherent oscillation of the boundary makes the instantaneous sheath edge location ambiguous and not a fixed parameter.\n\nThe relevance of a time-averaged sheath edge $\\bar{s}$ becomes apparent in the specified limit where the ion transit time through the sheath, $\\tau_i$, is much greater than the RF period, $T = 2\\pi/\\omega$. Ions, with mass $m_i$, are much heavier than electrons and possess significant inertia. They cannot respond to the fast-oscillating RF electric field. As an ion traverses the sheath, a journey taking many RF cycles ($\\tau_i \\gg T$), it effectively samples the electric field at different phases of its oscillation. The net force experienced by the ion is therefore determined by the time-averaged electric field profile over one RF cycle. Consequently, the ion's trajectory and its final energy upon striking the electrode are governed not by the instantaneous potential $V_s(t)$, but by the time-averaged potential structure. The narrow peak observed in the Ion Energy Distribution (IED) at the wafer is a direct consequence of this averaging effect; all ions gain an energy corresponding to the time-averaged potential drop they experience. Therefore, time-averaged quantities like the average sheath edge location $\\bar{s}$ and the average potential profile are the operationally relevant parameters for describing the ion dynamics and the resulting IED in this long-transit-time regime.\n\n2. Derivation of the Instantaneous Sheath Thickness Relation\n\nWe derive the relationship between the instantaneous sheath thickness $s(t)$, the instantaneous sheath potential $V_s(t)$, and the ion current density $J_i$. We use a coordinate system where the electrode is at $x=0$ and the sheath extends to the oscillating sheath edge at $x=s(t)$.\n\nWe adopt the following boundary conditions for the electric potential $\\phi(x,t)$:\n- At the sheath edge, $x=s(t)$: The potential is that of the bulk plasma, which we set as the reference, so $\\phi(s(t),t) = 0$. The electric field is assumed to be zero, $\\frac{d\\phi}{dx}|_{x=s(t)} = 0$.\n- At the electrode, $x=0$: The potential drop across the sheath is $V_s(t)$, so $\\phi(0,t) = -V_s(t)$.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from first principles as required.\n\nFirst, we apply the law of conservation of energy to an ion in the collisionless sheath. An ion enters the sheath at $x=s(t)$ with negligible kinetic energy (an explicit assumption) and at potential $\\phi=0$. At a position $x$ within the sheath, its velocity $v_i(x)$ is given by:\n$$ \\frac{1}{2} m_i v_i(x)^2 + e\\phi(x,t) = 0 \\implies v_i(x) = \\sqrt{\\frac{-2e\\phi(x,t)}{m_i}} $$\nNote that for an ion to accelerate, $\\phi(x,t)$ must be negative within the sheath, which is consistent with our boundary conditions. The velocity is directed towards the electrode (negative $x$ direction), but we are concerned with its magnitude for the current density calculation.\n\nSecond, we use the conservation of charge (continuity equation) for ions. The problem states that the ion conduction current density $J_i$ is constant. In the space-charge-limited sheath, we neglect electron density, so the charge density is $\\rho(x,t) \\approx e n_i(x,t)$. The current density is given by $J_i = e n_i(x,t) |v_i(x)|$. We can express the ion density $n_i$ as:\n$$ n_i(x,t) = \\frac{J_i}{e v_i(x)} = \\frac{J_i}{e} \\sqrt{\\frac{m_i}{-2e\\phi(x,t)}} $$\nThe charge density is therefore:\n$$ \\rho(x,t) = e n_i(x,t) = J_i \\sqrt{\\frac{m_i}{-2e\\phi(x,t)}} $$\n\nThird, we substitute this charge density into Poisson’s equation in one dimension, $\\frac{d^2\\phi}{dx^2} = -\\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0}$:\n$$ \\frac{d^2\\phi}{dx^2} = -\\frac{J_i}{\\epsilon_0} \\sqrt{\\frac{m_i}{-2e\\phi}} $$\n\nTo solve this differential equation, we multiply both sides by $2 \\frac{d\\phi}{dx}$ and integrate with respect to $x$:\n$$ 2\\frac{d\\phi}{dx}\\frac{d^2\\phi}{dx^2} = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left[\\left(\\frac{d\\phi}{dx}\\right)^2\\right] = -\\frac{2J_i}{\\epsilon_0} \\sqrt{\\frac{m_i}{2e}} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{-\\phi}} \\frac{d\\phi}{dx} $$\nIntegrating from an arbitrary position $x$ to the sheath edge $s(t)$:\n$$ \\int_x^{s(t)} \\frac{d}{dx'}\\left[\\left(\\frac{d\\phi}{dx'}\\right)^2\\right] dx' = -\\frac{2J_i}{\\epsilon_0} \\sqrt{\\frac{m_i}{2e}} \\int_x^{s(t)} (-\\phi)^{-1/2} \\frac{d\\phi}{dx'} dx' $$\n$$ \\left[\\left(\\frac{d\\phi}{dx'}\\right)^2\\right]_x^{s(t)} = -\\frac{2J_i}{\\epsilon_0} \\sqrt{\\frac{m_i}{2e}} \\int_{\\phi(x)}^{\\phi(s(t))} (-\\phi')^{-1/2} d\\phi' $$\nUsing the boundary conditions $\\frac{d\\phi}{dx}|_{x=s(t)}=0$ and $\\phi(s(t))=0$:\n$$ 0 - \\left(\\frac{d\\phi}{dx}\\right)^2 = -\\frac{2J_i}{\\epsilon_0} \\sqrt{\\frac{m_i}{2e}} \\left[ -2(-\\phi')^{1/2} \\right]_{\\phi(x)}^{0} $$\n$$ -\\left(\\frac{d\\phi}{dx}\\right)^2 = -\\frac{2J_i}{\\epsilon_0} \\sqrt{\\frac{m_i}{2e}} \\left( 0 - (-2(-\\phi(x))^{1/2}) \\right) $$\n$$ -\\left(\\frac{d\\phi}{dx}\\right)^2 = -\\frac{4J_i}{\\epsilon_0} \\sqrt{\\frac{m_i}{2e}} (-\\phi)^{1/2} $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{d\\phi}{dx}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4J_i}{\\epsilon_0} \\sqrt{\\frac{m_i}{2e}} (-\\phi)^{1/2} $$\nSince potential increases from $-V_s(t)$ at $x=0$ to $0$ at $x=s(t)$, we must have $\\frac{d\\phi}{dx} > 0$.

In the magnetic presheath, the magnetic field magnitude is approximately constant and the potential drop $\\Delta \\phi$ is smooth over scales of order $r_L$.\n\nStarting from conservation of total ion energy and the adiabatic invariance of the ion magnetic moment under these conditions, and using the requirement at the entrance to the Debye sheath that the ion velocity component normal to the wall must satisfy the Bohm criterion, derive an analytic expression for the minimal magnetic presheath potential drop $\\Delta \\phi$ needed to ensure that ions arriving at the Debye sheath satisfy the Bohm criterion when the magnetic field is oblique. Assume that upstream directed ion motion along the field is negligible. Then, evaluate this expression numerically for an argon plasma with electron temperature $T_e = 3\\,\\text{eV}$, magnetic field angle $\\alpha = 10^\\circ$, and singly charged ions. Express the final electric potential drop in volts and round your answer to three significant figures.",
            "solution": "The problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded in established plasma physics principles, well-posed, objective, and contains sufficient information to derive a unique solution.\n\nWe are tasked with deriving the minimal potential drop, $\\Delta \\phi$, across a magnetic presheath. Let the surface normal be the $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ direction. The potential at the entrance of the magnetic presheath (far upstream) is taken as the reference potential, $\\phi_0 = 0$. The potential at the entrance to the Debye sheath is $\\phi_s = -\\Delta\\phi$. The problem states that the ions are \"cold\" and their upstream motion is negligible, which we interpret as the standard initial condition for ions created at rest, $\\mathbf{v}_0 = 0$.\n\nThe analysis is based on two fundamental conservation laws for an ion of mass $m_i$ and charge $q=e$ (since it is singly charged) moving from the presheath entrance (state $0$) to the Debye sheath entrance (state $s$).\n\nFirst, the conservation of total energy states that the sum of kinetic and potential energy is constant:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}m_i v^2 + e\\phi = \\text{constant}\n$$\nApplying this to the initial and final states:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}m_i v_s^2 + e\\phi_s = \\frac{1}{2}m_i v_0^2 + e\\phi_0\n$$\nSubstituting the initial conditions $\\mathbf{v}_0 = 0$ and $\\phi_0 = 0$, and the final potential $\\phi_s = -\\Delta\\phi$:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}m_i v_s^2 - e\\Delta\\phi = 0\n$$\nThis gives the magnitude of the ion velocity at the sheath entrance in terms of the potential drop:\n$$\nv_s^2 = \\frac{2e\\Delta\\phi}{m_i} \\quad \\implies \\quad v_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{2e\\Delta\\phi}{m_i}}\n$$\n\nSecond, the adiabatic invariance of the magnetic moment, $\\mu$, applies. The magnetic moment is defined as:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{m_i v_\\perp^2}{2B}\n$$\nwhere $v_\\perp$ is the component of the ion's velocity perpendicular to the magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$. Since the ions start from rest ($\\mathbf{v}_0=0$), their initial perpendicular velocity is $v_{0,\\perp}=0$, and thus their initial magnetic moment is $\\mu_0=0$. As $\\mu$ is an adiabatic invariant, it remains constant throughout the ion's trajectory in the magnetic presheath. Therefore, at the sheath entrance:\n$$\n\\mu_s = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{m_i v_{s,\\perp}^2}{2B} = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad v_{s,\\perp} = 0\n$$\nThis crucial result implies that the ion velocity vector at the sheath entrance, $\\mathbf{v}_s$, must be purely parallel to the magnetic field vector $\\mathbf{B}$.\n\nThe magnetic field $\\mathbf{B}$ makes an angle $\\alpha$ with the surface normal $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$. We can write the unit vector in the direction of the magnetic field as $\\hat{\\mathbf{b}} = \\cos\\alpha\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + \\sin\\alpha\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$, where $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ is a direction parallel to the wall. The ion velocity vector at the sheath entrance is therefore:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}_s = v_s \\hat{\\mathbf{b}} = v_s (\\cos\\alpha\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + \\sin\\alpha\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}})\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for the speed $v_s$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{2e\\Delta\\phi}{m_i}} (\\cos\\alpha\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{x}} + \\sin\\alpha\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{y}})\n$$\n\nThe final step is to apply the Bohm criterion at the entrance to the Debye sheath. The Bohm criterion states that for a stable sheath to form, the ion velocity component normal to the wall, $v_{s,x}$, must be greater than or equal to the ion sound speed, $c_s$.\n$$\nv_{s,x} \\ge c_s\n$$\nFor a plasma with cold ions and isothermal, Boltzmann-distributed electrons of temperature $T_e$, the ion sound speed is given by:\n$$\nc_s = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_B T_e}{m_i}}\n$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\n\nFrom our expression for $\\mathbf{v}_s$, the component normal to the wall is:\n$$\nv_{s,x} = (\\mathbf{v}_s \\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{x}}) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2e\\Delta\\phi}{m_i}} \\cos\\alpha\n$$\nSubstituting this into the Bohm criterion inequality:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\frac{2e\\Delta\\phi}{m_i}} \\cos\\alpha \\ge \\sqrt{\\frac{k_B T_e}{m_i}}\n$$\nWe are looking for the minimal potential drop, $(\\Delta\\phi)_{min}$, which corresponds to the equality condition:\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\frac{2e(\\Delta\\phi)_{min}}{m_i}} \\cos\\alpha = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_B T_e}{m_i}}\n$$\nTo solve for $(\\Delta\\phi)_{min}$, we square both sides:\n$$\n\\frac{2e(\\Delta\\phi)_{min}}{m_i} \\cos^2\\alpha = \\frac{k_B T_e}{m_i}\n$$\nThe ion mass $m_i$ cancels. We can now isolate $(\\Delta\\phi)_{min}$:\n$$\n2e(\\Delta\\phi)_{min} \\cos^2\\alpha = k_B T_e\n$$\n$$\n(\\Delta\\phi)_{min} = \\frac{k_B T_e}{2e \\cos^2\\alpha}\n$$\nThis is the required analytic expression for the minimal magnetic presheath potential drop.\n\nNow, we evaluate this expression numerically. The problem gives the electron temperature as $T_e = 3\\,\\text{eV}$. This is a convenient unit, as the energy $k_B T_e$ is equal to the elementary charge $e$ multiplied by $3\\,\\text{V}$. Let $T_{e,V} = 3\\,\\text{V}$. The expression becomes:\n$$\n(\\Delta\\phi)_{min} = \\frac{e T_{e,V}}{2e \\cos^2\\alpha} = \\frac{T_{e,V}}{2\\cos^2\\alpha}\n$$\nThe magnetic field angle is given as $\\alpha = 10^\\circ$. Substituting the values:\n$$\n(\\Delta\\phi)_{min} = \\frac{3\\,\\text{V}}{2\\cos^2(10^\\circ)}\n$$\nCalculating the numerical value:\n$$\n\\cos(10^\\circ) \\approx 0.98480775\n$$\n$$\n\\cos^2(10^\\circ) \\approx (0.98480775)^2 \\approx 0.96984631\n$$\n$$\n(\\Delta\\phi)_{min} \\approx \\frac{3}{2 \\times 0.96984631} \\,\\text{V} \\approx \\frac{3}{1.93969262} \\,\\text{V} \\approx 1.54664\\,\\text{V}\n$$\nRounding the result to three significant figures, we get $1.55\\,\\text{V}$.",
