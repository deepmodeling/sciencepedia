It employs a simplified form of Sigmund's linear cascade theory, $Y \\propto S_n / U_s$, which is a standard starting point for analysis. The Padé-type approximant for the nuclear stopping power, $S_n(E)$, captures the characteristic behavior of this quantity in the specified energy range (initial rise followed by a decrease at higher energies).

The problem is scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It specifies a differentiable function to be maximized and provides all necessary constants. The procedure for finding the maximum (setting the derivative to zero) is explicitly stated. A unique, meaningful solution is expected to exist.\n- **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and quantitative language, free from ambiguity or subjective claims.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. It is self-contained, scientifically sound, and well-posed. The solution process will now proceed.\n\n### Solution\nThe objective is to find the ion energy $E^{*}$ that maximizes the sputtering yield at normal incidence, $Y(E,0)$. The problem states the sputtering yield is proportional to the ratio of the nuclear stopping power $S_n(E)$ to the surface binding energy $U_s$:\n$$\nY(E,0) \\propto \\frac{S_n(E)}{U_s}\n$$\nThe proportionality constant is assumed to be independent of energy $E$. Since $U_s$ is a positive constant, maximizing $Y(E,0)$ is equivalent to maximizing the function $S_n(E)$. The problem directs us to solve for the extremum of the function $F(E) = \\frac{S_n(E)}{U_s}$.\nSubstituting the given expression for $S_n(E)$:\n$$\nF(E) = \\frac{1}{U_s} \\left( \\frac{S_{0}\\,E}{1+\\beta E^{2}} \\right)\n$$\nTo find the energy $E^{*}$ at which this function is maximized, we must find its derivative with respect to $E$ and set it to zero.\n$$\n\\frac{dF}{dE} = 0\n$$\nThe constants $S_0$ and $U_s$ can be factored out of the differentiation:\n$$\n\\frac{dF}{dE} = \\frac{S_0}{U_s} \\frac{d}{dE} \\left( \\frac{E}{1+\\beta E^{2}} \\right)\n$$\nWe apply the quotient rule for differentiation, which states that for $f(x) = u(x)/v(x)$, $f'(x) = [u'(x)v(x) - u(x)v'(x)] / [v(x)]^2$.\nLet $u(E) = E$ and $v(E) = 1+\\beta E^2$. Their derivatives are $u'(E) = 1$ and $v'(E) = 2\\beta E$.\nApplying the rule:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dE} \\left( \\frac{E}{1+\\beta E^{2}} \\right) = \\frac{(1)(1+\\beta E^2) - (E)(2\\beta E)}{(1+\\beta E^2)^2} = \\frac{1+\\beta E^2 - 2\\beta E^2}{(1+\\beta E^2)^2} = \\frac{1 - \\beta E^2}{(1+\\beta E^2)^2}\n$$\nSo, the full derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{dF}{dE} = \\frac{S_0}{U_s} \\frac{1 - \\beta E^2}{(1+\\beta E^2)^2}\n$$\nSetting this derivative to zero to find the extremum $E^*$:\n$$\n\\frac{S_0}{U_s} \\frac{1 - \\beta (E^{*})^2}{(1+\\beta (E^{*})^2)^2} = 0\n$$\nSince $S_0/U_s$ is a non-zero constant and the denominator is always positive for real $E$, the condition simplifies to the numerator being zero:\n$$\n1 - \\beta (E^{*})^2 = 0\n$$\nThis equation is the derived condition for the energy $E^*$ that maximizes the yield. Solving for $E^{*}$ gives:\n$$\n\\beta (E^{*})^2 = 1 \\implies (E^{*})^2 = \\frac{1}{\\beta}\n$$\nSince energy must be a positive quantity, we take the principal square root. The closed-form expression for $E^{*}$ is:\n$$\nE^{*} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\beta}}\n$$\nTo confirm this is a maximum, we can examine the sign of the first derivative. For $E  E^*$, $E^2  1/\\beta$, so $1-\\beta E^2  0$, and $\\frac{dF}{dE}  0$ (function is increasing). For $E  E^*$, $E^2  1/\\beta$, so $1-\\beta E^2  0$, and $\\frac{dF}{dE}  0$ (function is decreasing). This confirms that $E^*$ corresponds to a local and global maximum for $E0$.\n\nNow, we compute the numerical value of $E^*$ using the given value $\\beta = 1.00 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{eV}^{-2}$.\n$$\nE^{*} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1.00 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{eV}^{-2}}} = \\frac{1}{1.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{eV}^{-1}} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{eV}\n$$\nThis value lies within the stated energy window of model validity, $[100, 5000]\\ \\mathrm{eV}$.\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$\nE^{*} = 1.000 \\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{eV}\n$$\n\nFinally, we provide a physical interpretation of $E^{*}$. The sputtering yield is the result of a competition between two energy-dependent phenomena:\n1.  **Energy Transfer Efficiency**: At low energies, increasing the incident ion energy $E$ leads to more momentum and energy transfer to target atoms in the collision cascade. This increases the likelihood that a surface atom gains enough energy to overcome the surface binding energy $U_s$. For low $E$ (where $\\beta E^2 \\ll 1$), the stopping power is approximated by $S_n(E) \\approx S_0 E$, so the yield initially increases with energy.\n2.  **Energy Deposition Depth**: As the incident ion energy $E$ increases further, the ion penetrates deeper into the target before the majority of its energy is deposited. The collision cascade is largest near the ion's end-of-range, which moves deeper into the bulk material. Sputtering is a surface phenomenon; energy deposited far from the surface does not contribute to the ejection of atoms. The $1/(1+\\beta E^2)$ term in the model accounts for this effect, causing the effective near-surface energy deposition to decrease at high energies. For high $E$ (where $\\beta E^2 \\gg 1$), $S_n(E) \\approx S_0 / (\\beta E)$, and the yield decreases with energy.\n\nThe optimal energy $E^{*}$ represents the \"sweet spot\" in this trade-off. At $E = E^{*}$, the ion is energetic enough to create a vigorous collision cascade, but not so energetic that the cascade is centered too deep below the surface. This specific energy maximizes the energy deposited in the near-surface region, resulting in the maximum possible sputtering yield for the given ion-target combination under this model.",

It presents a simplified but physically consistent model of ion sputtering, providing all necessary definitions and constraints to derive a unique solution. The model is based on established concepts in ion-solid interactions, such as Sigmund's linear cascade theory and the effect of a surface potential barrier. The problem is thus valid and we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe sputtering yield $Y(E, \\theta)$ is stated to be proportional to a product of factors: the probability of an ion contributing to sputtering and the energy it deposits in a near-surface escape layer.\n\n1.  **Deposited Energy in the Escape Layer**\n\n    According to the linear-cascade model (Element $1$), the deposited energy per unit path length, $\\frac{dE_{dep}}{ds}$, at a distance $s$ along the ion's trajectory decays exponentially:\n    $$ \\frac{dE_{dep}}{ds} = C_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{s}{a(E)}\\right) $$\n    where $C_0$ is a proportionality constant and $a(E)$ is the energy-dependent attenuation length.\n\n    The sputtering yield is proportional to the total energy deposited within a surface layer of thickness $\\Delta$, measured normal to the surface. For an ion incident at an angle $\\theta$ relative to the surface normal, the path length $L$ it traverses within this layer is given by the geometry of oblique incidence (Element $2$):\n    $$ L = \\frac{\\Delta}{\\cos\\theta} = \\frac{\\Delta}{\\mu} $$\n    where $\\mu \\equiv \\cos\\theta$.\n\n    The total energy deposited in this layer, $E_{dep, \\Delta}$, is obtained by integrating the energy deposition rate from $s=0$ (the surface) to $s=L$:\n    $$ E_{dep, \\Delta} = \\int_{0}^{L} C_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{s}{a(E)}\\right) ds = \\int_{0}^{\\Delta/\\mu} C_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{s}{a(E)}\\right) ds $$\n    Evaluating the integral gives:\n    $$ E_{dep, \\Delta} = C_0 \\left[-a(E) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{s}{a(E)}\\right)\\right]_{0}^{\\Delta/\\mu} = C_0 a(E) \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta}{\\mu a(E)}\\right)\\right) $$\n    The problem specifies the regime $\\Delta \\ll a(E)$. This implies the argument of the exponential, $\\frac{\\Delta}{\\mu a(E)}$, is small (for $\\mu$ not close to $0$). We can therefore use the first-order Taylor expansion $\\exp(-x) \\approx 1-x$ for small $x$:\n    $$ E_{dep, \\Delta} \\approx C_0 a(E) \\left(1 - \\left(1 - \\frac{\\Delta}{\\mu a(E)}\\right)\\right) = C_0 a(E) \\left(\\frac{\\Delta}{\\mu a(E)}\\right) = \\frac{C_0 \\Delta}{\\mu} $$\n    Thus, the energy deposited in the escape layer is, to leading order, inversely proportional to $\\mu = \\cos\\theta$.\n\n2.  **Surface Transmission Probability**\n\n    According to Element $3$, the probability of an ion contributing to sputtering is suppressed by a factor proportional to $\\exp(-U/E_{\\perp})$, where $U$ is an effective surface binding energy and $E_{\\perp}$ is the normal kinetic energy, defined in the problem as $E_{\\perp} = E \\mu^2$. Let's call this probability $P_{trans}$.\n    $$ P_{trans} \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{U}{E_{\\perp}}\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{U}{E\\mu^2}\\right) $$\n\n3.  **Total Sputtering Yield and Angular Factor**\n\n    The total sputtering yield $Y(E, \\theta)$ is proportional to the product of the transmission probability and the energy deposited in the layer.\n    $$ Y(E, \\theta) \\propto P_{trans} \\cdot E_{dep, \\Delta} $$\n    Substituting the derived proportionalities:\n    $$ Y(E, \\theta) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{U}{E\\mu^2}\\right) \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\mu} $$\n    The problem asks for a multiplicative angular factor $F(E, \\theta)$ such that $Y(E, \\theta) \\propto F(E, \\theta)$, where the proportionality factor is independent of $\\theta$. This factor is therefore:\n    $$ F(E, \\theta) = \\frac{1}{\\mu} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{U}{E\\mu^2}\\right) $$\n\n4.  **Maximization of the Sputtering Yield**\n\n    To find the angle $\\theta^{\\star}$ that maximizes the yield $Y(E, \\theta)$, we need to find the maximum of $F(E, \\theta)$. It is more convenient to work with the variable $\\mu = \\cos\\theta$. Let $f(\\mu) = \\mu^{-1} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{U}{E\\mu^2}\\right)$. We seek to find the value of $\\mu$ that maximizes $f(\\mu)$ in the physical range $\\mu \\in (0, 1]$. We find the extremum by setting the derivative of $f(\\mu)$ with respect to $\\mu$ equal to zero.\n    $$ \\frac{df}{d\\mu} = \\frac{d}{d\\mu} \\left[\\mu^{-1} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{U}{E}\\mu^{-2}\\right)\\right] $$\n    Using the product rule and chain rule:\n    $$ \\frac{df}{d\\mu} = (-\\mu^{-2}) \\exp\\left(-\\frac{U}{E}\\mu^{-2}\\right) + \\mu^{-1} \\left[ \\exp\\left(-\\frac{U}{E}\\mu^{-2}\\right) \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{U}{E}\\right) \\cdot (-2\\mu^{-3}) \\right] $$\n    $$ \\frac{df}{d\\mu} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{U}{E}\\mu^{-2}\\right) \\left[ -\\mu^{-2} + \\frac{2U}{E}\\mu^{-4} \\right] $$\n    For an extremum, we set $\\frac{df}{d\\mu} = 0$. Since the exponential term is always positive, we must have:\n    $$ -\\mu^{-2} + \\frac{2U}{E}\\mu^{-4} = 0 $$\n    Assuming $\\mu \\neq 0$, we can multiply the equation by $\\mu^4$:\n    $$ -\\mu^2 + \\frac{2U}{E} = 0 $$\n    This gives the value $\\mu^{\\star}$ for the extremum:\n    $$ (\\mu^{\\star})^2 = \\frac{2U}{E} \\implies \\mu^{\\star} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2U}{E}} $$\n    The problem states that $E > 2U$, which ensures that $\\frac{2U}{E}  1$, and therefore $\\mu^{\\star}  1$. This guarantees a physical solution for $\\theta^{\\star} \\in (0, \\pi/2)$.\n\n    To verify that this extremum is a maximum, we analyze the sign of the derivative $\\frac{df}{d\\mu}$. The sign is determined by the term in brackets, $g(\\mu) = -\\mu^{-2} + \\frac{2U}{E}\\mu^{-4} = \\mu^{-4}(-\\mu^2 + \\frac{2U}{E})$.\n    -   For $\\mu  \\mu^{\\star}$, we have $\\mu^2  (\\mu^{\\star})^2 = \\frac{2U}{E}$. Thus, $-\\mu^2 + \\frac{2U}{E}  0$, and $\\frac{df}{d\\mu}  0$. The function is increasing.\n    -   For $\\mu  \\mu^{\\star}$, we have $\\mu^2  (\\mu^{\\star})^2 = \\frac{2U}{E}$. Thus, $-\\mu^2 + \\frac{2U}{E}  0$, and $\\frac{df}{d\\mu}  0$. The function is decreasing.\n    Since the derivative changes sign from positive to negative at $\\mu^{\\star}$, this point corresponds to a local maximum.\n\n    Finally, we find the angle $\\theta^{\\star}$ corresponding to $\\mu^{\\star}$:\n    $$ \\cos(\\theta^{\\star}) = \\mu^{\\star} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2U}{E}} $$\n    $$ \\theta^{\\star} = \\arccos\\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2U}{E}}\\right) $$\n    The result is expressed in radians, as is standard for the output of the arccosine function.",
