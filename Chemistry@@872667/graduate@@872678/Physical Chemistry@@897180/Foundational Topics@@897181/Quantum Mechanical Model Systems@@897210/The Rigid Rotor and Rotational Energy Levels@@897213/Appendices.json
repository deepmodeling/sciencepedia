Derivation of Electric-Dipole Selection Rules\nThe probability of a transition between an initial state $|\\Psi_i\\rangle$ and a final state $|\\Psi_f\\rangle$ induced by an electric field is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the transition dipole moment integral, $\\vec{\\mu}_{fi} = \\langle \\Psi_f | \\hat{\\vec{\\mu}} | \\Psi_i \\rangle$. A transition is \"allowed\" if this integral is non-zero. For a rigid linear rotor, the wavefunctions are the spherical harmonics, $|\\Psi\\rangle = |J, M\\rangle = Y_J^M(\\theta, \\phi)$, where $J$ is the total angular momentum quantum number and $M$ is its projection onto the space-fixed $z$-axis. The initial state is $|J', M'\\rangle$ and the final state is $|J'', M''\\rangle$.\n\nThe electric dipole moment operator $\\hat{\\vec{\\mu}}$ is a vector fixed in the molecule's frame with constant magnitude $\\mu_0$. Its components in the space-fixed frame are:\n$$\n\\mu_x = \\mu_0 \\sin\\theta \\cos\\phi \\\\\n\\mu_y = \\mu_0 \\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi \\\\\n\\mu_z = \\mu_0 \\cos\\theta\n$$\nThese components can be expressed in terms of spherical harmonics $Y_l^m(\\theta, \\phi)$:\n$$\n\\mu_z = \\mu_0 \\cos\\theta = \\mu_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{4\\pi}{3}} Y_1^0(\\theta, \\phi)\n$$\n$$\n\\mu_x \\pm i\\mu_y = \\mu_0 \\sin\\theta e^{\\pm i\\phi} = \\mp \\mu_0 \\sqrt{\\frac{8\\pi}{3}} Y_1^{\\pm 1}(\\theta, \\phi)\n$$\nFor a transition to be allowed, at least one component of $\\vec{\\mu}_{fi}$ must be non-zero. Let us examine the integral for the $z$-component:\n$$\n\\langle J'', M'' | \\mu_z | J', M' \\rangle \\propto \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^\\pi (Y_{J''}^{M''})^* Y_1^0 Y_{J'}^{M'} \\sin\\theta d\\theta d\\phi\n$$\nThis is an integral over a product of three spherical harmonics. From the theory of angular momentum (specifically, the Wigner-Eckart theorem or the properties of Gaunt coefficients), this integral is non-zero only if two conditions are met:\n(a) The sum of the magnetic quantum numbers is conserved: $M'' = M' + 0$, which implies $\\Delta M = M'' - M' = 0$.\n(b) The angular momentum quantum numbers satisfy the triangle inequality: $|J' - 1| \\le J'' \\le J' + 1$. This implies that $\\Delta J = J'' - J'$ can only be $0$, $+1$, or $-1$.\n\nSimilarly, for the $\\mu_x \\pm i\\mu_y$ components, which are proportional to $Y_1^{\\pm 1}$, the conditions are:\n(a) $M'' = M' \\pm 1$, which implies $\\Delta M = \\pm 1$.\n(b) $|J' - 1| \\le J'' \\le J' + 1$, which again implies $\\Delta J = 0, \\pm 1$.\n\nCombining these results, the preliminary selection rules are $\\Delta J = 0, \\pm 1$ and $\\Delta M = 0, \\pm 1$. However, we must also consider parity. The wavefunction $Y_J^M$ has a parity of $(-1)^J$. The dipole operator $\\hat{\\vec{\\mu}}$ is a vector and has odd parity, $(-1)^1$. For the integral $\\langle \\Psi_f | \\hat{\\vec{\\mu}} | \\Psi_i \\rangle$ to be non-zero, the integrand as a whole must have even parity. The parity of the integrand is:\n$$\n\\text{Parity} = (\\text{Parity of } \\Psi_f^*) \\times (\\text{Parity of } \\hat{\\vec{\\mu}}) \\times (\\text{Parity of } \\Psi_i) = (-1)^{J''} \\times (-1)^1 \\times (-1)^{J'} = (-1)^{J'' - J' + 1}\n$$\nFor the integral to be non-zero, the parity must be even, so the exponent must be an even integer. This requires $J'' - J'$ to be an odd integer. Therefore, the case $\\Delta J = 0$ is forbidden.\nThe final selection rules for electric-dipole pure rotational transitions are:\n$$\n\\Delta J = \\pm 1 \\\\\n\\Delta M = 0, \\pm 1\n$$\nAdditionally, the permanent dipole moment must be non-zero ($\\mu_0 \\ne 0$), which is true for the specified heteronuclear molecule $XY$.\n\n2. Identification of Allowed Absorption Transition from $J=5$\nThe energy levels of a rigid rotor are given by $E_J = B_{rot} J(J+1)$, where $B_{rot} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I}$ is the rotational constant in energy units and $I$ is the moment of inertia. Since $B_{rot} > 0$, the energy increases with increasing $J$. An absorption transition involves moving from a lower energy level to a higher one. Therefore, for absorption, the final state $J''$ must have a higher energy than the initial state $J'$, which means $J'' > J'$. This requires $\\Delta J = J'' - J' = +1$.\nThe initial state is given as $J = 5$. Applying the selection rule $\\Delta J = +1$, the final state must be $J'' = 5 + 1 = 6$.\nThus, the only allowed pure rotational absorption transition from the $J=5$ level is the transition $J=5 \\to J=6$. The selection rule on $M$ allows transitions between the various degenerate sublevels, but in the absence of an external field, these all correspond to a single absorption line frequency.\n\n3. Computation of the Absorption Line Frequency\nThe frequency $\\nu$ of the absorbed photon is given by Planck's relation, $\\Delta E = h\\nu$. The energy difference $\\Delta E$ for the transition $J \\to J+1$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta E = E_{J+1} - E_J = B_{rot} (J+1)(J+2) - B_{rot} J(J+1) = B_{rot} (J+1) [(J+2) - J] = 2 B_{rot} (J+1)\n$$\nSubstituting $B_{rot} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I} = \\frac{h^2}{8\\pi^2 I}$:\n$$\n\\Delta E = 2 \\left(\\frac{h^2}{8\\pi^2 I}\\right) (J+1) = \\frac{h^2}{4\\pi^2 I}(J+1)\n$$\nThe frequency is then $\\nu = \\frac{\\Delta E}{h} = \\frac{h}{4\\pi^2 I}(J+1)$. It is more conventional to define the rotational constant in frequency units, $B = \\frac{h}{8\\pi^2 I}$. Then the frequency of the transition is $\\nu = 2B(J+1)$.\nFor the transition $J=5 \\to J=6$, the frequency is $\\nu = 2B(5+1) = 12B$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the reduced mass $\\mu$ of the molecule:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{m_X m_Y}{m_X + m_Y} = \\frac{(24.0\\ \\mathrm{u})(40.0\\ \\mathrm{u})}{24.0\\ \\mathrm{u} + 40.0\\ \\mathrm{u}} = \\frac{960}{64.0}\\ \\mathrm{u} = 15.0\\ \\mathrm{u}\n$$\nConverting to SI units:\n$$\n\\mu = 15.0 \\times (1.66053906660 \\times 10^{-27}\\ \\mathrm{kg}) = 2.4908085999 \\times 10^{-26}\\ \\mathrm{kg}\n$$\nNext, we calculate the moment of inertia $I = \\mu r^2$.

It is a standard problem in molecular spectroscopy. We shall proceed with its solution.\n\nThe quantum mechanical Hamiltonian for a rigid rotor expressed in the body-fixed principal axis system is given by:\n$$ \\hat{H} = \\frac{\\hat{J}_{a}^{2}}{2I_{a}} + \\frac{\\hat{J}_{b}^{2}}{2I_{b}} + \\frac{\\hat{J}_{c}^{2}}{2I_{c}} $$\nwhere $\\hat{J}_{a}$, $\\hat{J}_{b}$, and $\\hat{J}_{c}$ are the components of the angular momentum operator along the principal axes $a$, $b$, and $c$, and $I_{a}$, $I_{b}$, and $I_{c}$ are the corresponding principal moments of inertia.\n\nFor a symmetric top molecule, two of the principal moments of inertia are equal. The problem specifies a prolate symmetric top, for which $I_{b} = I_{c}$. Substituting this condition into the Hamiltonian gives:\n$$ \\hat{H} = \\frac{\\hat{J}_{a}^{2}}{2I_{a}} + \\frac{\\hat{J}_{b}^{2} + \\hat{J}_{c}^{2}}{2I_{b}} $$\nThe square of the total angular momentum operator, $\\hat{J}^{2}$, is related to its components by $\\hat{J}^{2} = \\hat{J}_{a}^{2} + \\hat{J}_{b}^{2} + \\hat{J}_{c}^{2}$. We can thus express the sum $\\hat{J}_{b}^{2} + \\hat{J}_{c}^{2}$ as $\\hat{J}^{2} - \\hat{J}_{a}^{2}$. Substituting this into the Hamiltonian expression yields:\n$$ \\hat{H} = \\frac{\\hat{J}_{a}^{2}}{2I_{a}} + \\frac{\\hat{J}^{2} - \\hat{J}_{a}^{2}}{2I_{b}} $$\nRearranging the terms, we obtain the final form of the Hamiltonian for a prolate symmetric top:\n$$ \\hat{H} = \\frac{\\hat{J}^{2}}{2I_{b}} + \\left( \\frac{1}{2I_{a}} - \\frac{1}{2I_{b}} \\right) \\hat{J}_{a}^{2} $$\nThe eigenfunctions of this Hamiltonian are the symmetric top wavefunctions, denoted by $|J, K, M\\rangle$, which are simultaneous eigenfunctions of $\\hat{J}^{2}$, $\\hat{J}_{z}$ (the component of angular momentum on a space-fixed axis), and $\\hat{J}_{a}$ (the component on the body-fixed symmetry axis).

The energy eigenvalues can then be written more compactly as:\n$$ E_{J,K} = B J(J+1) + (A-B)K^{2} $$\nNote that the energy is independent of the quantum number $M$ in the absence of external fields, and depends on $K^{2}$, making states with $\\pm K$ (for $K \\neq 0$) degenerate.\n\nNext, we establish the selection rules for pure rotational transitions induced by electromagnetic radiation. A transition is allowed only if the transition dipole moment is non-zero. The problem states that the molecule possesses a permanent electric dipole moment $\\vec{\\mu}$ that lies strictly along the symmetry axis ($a$-axis).

For such a parallel transition in a symmetric top, the selection rules are:\n$$ \\Delta J = \\pm 1 $$\n$$ \\Delta K = 0 $$\nThe rule $\\Delta K=0$ is a direct consequence of the dipole moment being aligned with the axis of quantization for $K$. The rule $\\Delta J = \\pm 1$ arises from the conservation of angular momentum, as a photon carries one unit of angular momentum.\n\nWe must identify the lowest-energy allowed transition from the ground rotational state. The ground state is the state with the minimum possible energy, which corresponds to the lowest possible values of the quantum numbers. This is the state where $J=0$, which strictly requires $K=0$.

The moment of inertia for a diatomic molecule with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ separated by a distance $r$ is $I = \\mu_r r^2$, where $\\mu_r = \\frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1+m_2}$ is the reduced mass.\n\nThe unperturbed stationary states are the eigenfunctions of $\\hat{H}_0$, which are the spherical harmonics $Y_{JM}(\\theta, \\phi)$, denoted by the kets $|J,M\\rangle$. The corresponding energy eigenvalues are:\n$$ E_J^{(0)} = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I} J(J+1) = B J(J+1) $$\nwhere $B = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I}$ is the rotational constant. These energy levels are $(2J+1)$-fold degenerate with respect to the magnetic quantum number $M$.\n\nThe perturbation is the potential energy of the permanent electric dipole moment $\\vec{\\mu}$ in the uniform electric field $\\vec{\\mathcal{E}}$, which is directed along the laboratory $z$-axis:\n$$ \\hat{V} = -\\vec{\\mu} \\cdot \\vec{\\mathcal{E}} = - \\mu \\mathcal{E} \\cos\\theta $$\nwhere $\\mu$ is the magnitude of the dipole moment (aligned with the molecular axis) and $\\theta$ is the angle between the molecular axis and the $z$-axis.\n\nAccording to time-independent perturbation theory, the energy correction to the state $|J,M\\rangle$ is given by a series expansion.\n\nThe first-order energy correction is the expectation value of the perturbation in the unperturbed state:\n$$ \\Delta E_{JM}^{(1)} = \\langle J,M | \\hat{V} | J,M \\rangle = - \\mu\\mathcal{E} \\langle J,M | \\cos\\theta | J,M \\rangle $$\nThe operator $\\cos\\theta$ has odd parity, while the probability density $|\\Psi_{JM}|^2 = |Y_{JM}|^2$ has even parity. The integral of an odd function over the entire symmetric domain (the unit sphere) is zero. Therefore, the matrix element $\\langle J,M | \\cos\\theta | J,M \\rangle = 0$ for all $J$ and $M$. Consequently, the first-order Stark effect for a rigid rotor is zero:\n$$ \\Delta E_{JM}^{(1)} = 0 $$\n\nThe second-order energy correction is given by the expression:\n$$ \\Delta E_{JM}^{(2)} = \\sum_{J' \\neq J, M'} \\frac{|\\langle J',M' | \\hat{V} | J,M \\rangle|^2}{E_J^{(0)} - E_{J'}^{(0)}} $$\nThe sum runs over all states $|J',M'\\rangle$ excluding the state $|J,M\\rangle$ itself.\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\hat{V}$ and $E_J^{(0)}$, we have:\n$$ \\Delta E_{JM}^{(2)} = (\\mu\\mathcal{E})^2 \\sum_{J' \\neq J, M'} \\frac{|\\langle J',M' | \\cos\\theta | J,M \\rangle|^2}{B[J(J+1) - J'(J'+1)]} $$\n\nTo evaluate this sum, we must determine the matrix elements $\\langle J',M' | \\cos\\theta | J,M \\rangle$. The operator $\\cos\\theta$ is proportional to the spherical harmonic $Y_{1,0}$. From the properties of angular momentum addition (Wigner-Eckart theorem), these matrix elements are non-zero only if the following selection rules are satisfied:\n$1$. $\\Delta J = J' - J = \\pm 1$. This arises from coupling angular momenta $J$ and $1$ to yield $J'$ ($|J-1| \\le J' \\le J+1$) and the parity requirement that $J'+1+J$ must be even, implying $J' \\ne J$.\n$2$. $\\Delta M = M' - M = 0$. This is because $\\cos\\theta$ (proportional to $Y_{1,0}$) carries zero projection of angular momentum onto the $z$-axis.\n\nThese selection rules drastically simplify the sum. For a given state $|J,M\\rangle$, only states $|J-1, M\\rangle$ and $|J+1, M\\rangle$ can contribute to the sum.\nThe sum becomes:\n$$ \\Delta E_{JM}^{(2)} = (\\mu\\mathcal{E})^2 \\left( \\frac{|\\langle J-1,M | \\cos\\theta | J,M \\rangle|^2}{E_J^{(0)} - E_{J-1}^{(0)}} + \\frac{|\\langle J+1,M | \\cos\\theta | J,M \\rangle|^2}{E_J^{(0)} - E_{J+1}^{(0)}} \\right) $$\nNote that for the ground state $J=0$, the term with $J-1$ does not exist.\n\nThe required squared matrix elements of $\\cos\\theta$ are standard results from angular momentum theory:\n$$ |\\langle J-1,M | \\cos\\theta | J,M \\rangle|^2 = \\frac{J^2 - M^2}{(2J-1)(2J+1)} $$\n$$ |\\langle J+1,M | \\cos\\theta | J,M \\rangle|^2 = \\frac{(J+1)^2 - M^2}{(2J+1)(2J+3)} $$\nThe energy denominators are:\n$$ E_J^{(0)} - E_{J-1}^{(0)} = B[J(J+1) - (J-1)J] = B[\nJ^2+J-J^2+J] = 2BJ $$\n$$ E_J^{(0)} - E_{J+1}^{(0)} = B[J(J+1) - (J+1)(J+2)] = B(J+1)[J-(J+2)] = -2B(J+1) $$\n\nWe now derive the specific formulas for two cases.\n\nCase 1: $J=0$ (and thus $M=0$)\nOnly the transition to $J'=1$ is possible.\n$$ \\Delta E_{00}^{(2)} = (\\mu\\mathcal{E})^2 \\frac{|\\langle 1,0 | \\cos\\theta | 0,0 \\rangle|^2}{E_0^{(0)} - E_1^{(0)}} $$\nUsing the formula for $|\\langle J+1,M | \\cos\\theta | J,M \\rangle|^2$ with $J=0, M=0$:\n$$ |\\langle 1,0 | \\cos\\theta | 0,0 \\rangle|^2 = \\frac{(0+1)^2 - 0^2}{(2(0)+1)(2(0)+3)} = \\frac{1}{3} $$\nThe energy denominator is $E_0^{(0)} - E_1^{(0)} = -2B(0+1) = -2B$.\nSubstituting these values:\n$$ \\Delta E_{00}^{(2)} = (\\mu\\mathcal{E})^2 \\frac{1/3}{-2B} = -\\frac{(\\mu\\mathcal{E})^2}{6B} = -\\frac{(\\mu\\mathcal{E})^2 I}{3\\hbar^2} $$\n\nCase 2: $J \\geq 1$\nBoth transitions to $J-1$ and $J+1$ contribute.\n$$ \\Delta E_{JM}^{(2)} = (\\mu\\mathcal{E})^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{2BJ} \\frac{J^2 - M^2}{(2J-1)(2J+1)} + \\frac{1}{-2B(J+1)} \\frac{(J+1)^2 - M^2}{(2J+1)(2J+3)} \\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta E_{JM}^{(2)} = \\frac{(\\mu\\mathcal{E})^2}{2B(2J+1)} \\left( \\frac{J^2 - M^2}{J(2J-1)} - \\frac{(J+1)^2 - M^2}{(J+1)(2J+3)} \\right) $$\nTo simplify the expression in the parenthesis, we find a common denominator:\n$$ \\frac{(J^2 - M^2)(J+1)(2J+3) - ((J+1)^2 - M^2)J(2J-1)}{J(J+1)(2J-1)(2J+3)} $$\nThe numerator simplifies to $(2J+1)[J(J+1) - 3M^2]$.\nSubstituting this back, we obtain the final expression:\n$$ \\Delta E_{JM}^{(2)} = \\frac{(\\mu\\mathcal{E})^2}{2B(2J+1)} \\frac{(2J+1)[J(J+1) - 3M^2]}{J(J+1)(2J-1)(2J+3)} $$\n$$ \\Delta E_{JM}^{(2)} = \\frac{(\\mu\\mathcal{E})^2}{2B} \\frac{J(J+1) - 3M^2}{J(J+1)(2J-1)(2J+3)} $$\nUsing $B = \\frac{\\hbar^2}{2I}$, this is equivalent to:\n$$ \\Delta E_{JM}^{(2)} = \\frac{(\\mu\\mathcal{E})^2 I}{\\hbar^2} \\frac{J(J+1) - 3M^2}{J(J+1)(2J-1)(2J+3)} $$\n\nThe program will implement these two derived formulas. For each test case, it will first convert all input parameters to SI units. It will calculate the moment of inertia $I$. Then, based on the value of $J$, it will apply the appropriate formula to compute $\\Delta E_{JM}^{(2)}$ in Joules. A special check is included for nonpolar molecules ($\\mu=0$), for which the Stark shift is trivially zero.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives and computes the quadratic Stark energy correction for a linear rigid rotor.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        # (m1 [u], m2 [u], r [pm], mu [D], E [kV/cm], J, M)\n        (35.453, 1.00784, 127.45, 1.08, 50.0, 0, 0),\n        (12.000000, 15.994915, 112.83, 0.112, 100.0, 1, 0),\n        (14.003074, 14.003074, 109.76, 0.0, 200.0, 4, 2),\n        (1.00784, 18.998403, 91.70, 1.826, 25.0, 2, 2),\n    ]\n\n    # Physical constants in SI units\n    H_BAR = 1.054571817e-34      # J·s\n    U_TO_KG = 1.66053906660e-27  # kg/u\n    D_TO_CM = 3.33564e-30      # C·m/D\n    KV_CM_TO_V_M = 1.0e5       # (V/m) / (kV/cm)\n    PM_TO_M = 1.0e-12          # m/pm\n\n    results = []\n    \n    for case in test_cases:\n        m1_u, m2_u, r_pm, mu_D, E_kV_cm, J, M = case\n\n        # For nonpolar molecules, the Stark effect is zero.\n        if mu_D == 0.0:\n            results.append(0.0)\n            continue\n\n        # Convert input parameters to SI units\n        m1 = m1_u * U_TO_KG\n        m2 = m2_u * U_TO_KG\n        r = r_pm * PM_TO_M\n        mu = mu_D * D_TO_CM\n        E_field = E_kV_cm * KV_CM_TO_V_M\n\n        # Calculate derived physical quantities\n        reduced_mass = (m1 * m2) / (m1 + m2)\n        moment_of_inertia = reduced_mass * r**2\n\n        # Common factor in the energy shift expressions\n        prefactor = (mu * E_field)**2 * moment_of_inertia / (H_BAR**2)\n\n        energy_shift = 0.0\n        if J == 0:\n            # Formula for the ground state (J=0, M=0)\n            # ΔE = - (μE)²I / (3ħ²)\n            energy_shift = -prefactor / 3.0\n        else:\n            # Formula for excited states (J >= 1)\n            # ΔE = (μE)²I/ħ² * [J(J+1) - 3M²] / [J(J+1)(2J-1)(2J+3)]\n            numerator = float(J * (J + 1) - 3 * M**2)\n            denominator = float(J * (J + 1) * (2 * J - 1) * (2 * J + 3))\n            \n            # Denominator is non-zero for integer J >= 1\n            energy_shift = prefactor * (numerator / denominator)\n            \n        results.append(energy_shift)\n\n    # Format the results as specified and print\n    formatted_results = [f\"{res:.10e}\" for res in results]\n    print(f\"[{','.join(formatted_results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2679582"}]}
