I will proceed with its solution.\n\nThe system is a single-phase, compressible gas contained within a closed, rigid, and perfectly insulated vessel. The process involves stirring the gas with a paddle wheel, taking it from an initial equilibrium state to a final equilibrium state.\n\nLet us analyze the energy transfers and state changes according to the first law of thermodynamics, which is given as $dU = \\delta q + \\delta w$. The integrated form for a finite process is $\\Delta U = q + w$. The sign convention specifies that $q$ and $w$ are positive for energy entering the system.\n\n$1$. **Classification of Energy Transfer**:\nThe vessel is described as \"perfectly insulated,\" meaning it is adiabatic. For an adiabatic process, there is no transfer of energy as heat across the boundary. Therefore, the heat transfer $q$ is zero.\n$$q = 0$$\nEnergy is added to the system by a paddle wheel driven by an external motor. The rotation of the paddle wheel inside the gas is a form of work done *on* the system. This type of work is often referred to as shaft work or stirring work. Since energy is transferred into the system as work, the value of work $w$ is positive according to the given sign convention.\n$$w > 0$$\nThis is a non-expansion-compression work, as the vessel is rigid, meaning its volume $V$ is constant ($dV=0$). The work associated with volume change, $w_{PV} = -\\int P_{ext} dV$, is therefore zero. The total work $w$ is entirely due to the stirring.\n\n$2$. **Change in Internal Energy ($\\Delta U$)**:\nApplying the first law of thermodynamics, $\\Delta U = q + w$, with our findings:\n$$\\Delta U = 0 + w = w$$\nSince $w > 0$, the change in internal energy of the system must be positive.\n$$\\Delta U > 0$$\n\n$3$. **Change in Temperature ($\\Delta T$)**:\nThe internal energy $U$ of a single-phase system can be expressed as a function of temperature $T$ and volume $V$, i.e., $U = U(T, V)$. Its total differential is:\n$$dU = \\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial T}\\right)_V dT + \\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial V}\\right)_T dV$$\nBy definition, the heat capacity at constant volume is $C_V = \\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial T}\\right)_V$. The problem states that the gas is contained in a \"rigid\" vessel, which implies the process is isochoric (constant volume). Thus, $dV = 0$.\nSubstituting these facts into the expression for $dU$:\n$$dU = C_V dT + \\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial V}\\right)_T (0) = C_V dT$$\nFor a finite change between two equilibrium states, we integrate this expression:\n$$\\Delta U = \\int_{T_{initial}}^{T_{final}} C_V(T, V) dT$$\nThe problem states that the gas has a positive isochoric heat capacity, $C_V(T, V) > 0$, throughout the process. We have already established that $\\Delta U > 0$.\nGiven that the integrand $C_V$ is strictly positive, the integral can only be positive if the upper limit of integration is greater than the lower limit. That is, $T_{final} > T_{initial}$.\nTherefore, the change in temperature $\\Delta T = T_{final} - T_{initial}$ must be positive.\n$$\\Delta T > 0$$\nThis conclusion is general and does not depend on whether the gas is ideal or real. The term $(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial V})_T$, which accounts for intermolecular forces in a real gas, is irrelevant because the volume does not change.\n\n**Summary of Conclusions**:\nThe process is adiabatic ($q=0$) and isochoric ($dV=0$). The energy input is entirely in the form of work ($w>0$). This leads to an increase in internal energy ($\\Delta U>0$) and, consequently, an increase in temperature ($\\Delta T>0$) for any substance with a positive heat capacity $C_V$.\n\nNow, we evaluate each of the provided options.\n\n**A) The energy input is classified as heat with $q>0$ and $w=0$, so $\\Delta U>0$ while $\\Delta T<0$ because stirring increases disorder.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The energy input is work, not heat. On an adiabatic boundary, $q=0$. The work is non-zero, $w>0$. Thus, the classification $q>0$ and $w=0$ is false. Furthermore, as derived, $\\Delta T > 0$, not $\\Delta T < 0$. The reasoning about \"disorder\" is thermodynamically imprecise and leads to a wrong conclusion.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B) The energy input is classified as work with $w>0$ and $q=0$, so $\\Delta U>0$ and $\\Delta T>0$ for any simple compressible gas with $C_V>0$.**\nThis statement correctly identifies the energy transfer as work ($w>0$) and the process as adiabatic ($q=0$). It correctly deduces from the first law that $\\Delta U = w > 0$. It also correctly concludes that for a constant volume process with $C_V > 0$, a positive $\\Delta U$ necessitates a positive $\\Delta T$. The reasoning is entirely consistent with our derivation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C) The energy input splits equally into heat and work with $q=w>0$, so $\\Delta U=0$ and $\\Delta T=0$ by the adiabatic, rigid constraints.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The process is adiabatic, which by definition means $q=0$. The claim that $q=w>0$ is a contradiction. Consequently, the conclusion that $\\Delta U=0$ is false; instead, $\\Delta U > 0$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D) The energy input is classified as work but $w<0$ because the gas does work on the paddle, with $q=0$, so $\\Delta U<0$ and $\\Delta T<0$.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Work is done *on* the gas *by* the paddle, which is driven by an external motor. Energy is transferred *to* the system. As per the specified sign convention, $w>0$. The premise that the gas does work on the paddle ($w<0$) is false. This leads to incorrect conclusions for the signs of $\\Delta U$ and $\\Delta T$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E) The energy input is classified as work with $w>0$ and $q=0$, so $\\Delta U>0$ but $\\Delta T$ could decrease at constant volume if intermolecular attractions dominate.**\nThis statement is partially correct in identifying $w>0$, $q=0$ and $\\Delta U>0$. However, the final conclusion about $\\Delta T$ is incorrect. For any system at constant volume, the relationship $dU = C_V dT$ holds. Since $\\Delta U>0$ and it is given that $C_V>0$, it is a mathematical necessity that $\\Delta T>0$. The role of intermolecular forces, captured in the term $(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial V})_T$, is irrelevant for an isochoric process because $dV=0$. A decrease in temperature for a real gas upon energy addition is not possible under these specific constraints (constant volume, $C_V>0$).\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2674298"}, {"introduction": "Once the fundamental definitions of heat and work are clear, we can explore their quantitative dependence on the thermodynamic path.

Consider two paths connecting these two volumes:\n- Path A: An irreversible adiabatic compression against a constant external pressure $P_{\\mathrm{ext}}$.\n- Path B: A reversible adiabatic (quasi-static) compression.\n\nAssume the ideal gas equation of state holds at all equilibrium states and that the molar heat capacity at constant volume is $C_{V}$ (constant), the molar heat capacity at constant pressure is $C_{P}$ (constant), and the heat capacity ratio is $\\gamma \\equiv C_{P}/C_{V}$.

No units are required.", "solution": "The posed problem is subjected to validation against established principles of physical chemistry and mathematical consistency.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- System: A closed, frictionless piston–cylinder containing $n$ moles of an ideal gas.\n- Gas Properties: Molar heat capacity at constant volume $C_{V}$ is constant. Molar heat capacity at constant pressure $C_{P}$ is constant.

It is objective and well-defined. The problem is formalizable and directly pertinent to the topic of the First Law of Thermodynamics. The conditions describe standard, albeit idealized, thermodynamic processes.\n\nA crucial point is the interpretation of the \"constant external pressure $P_{\\mathrm{ext}}$\" in Path A. For the compression to cease at the specified final volume $V_{f}$ and for the system to be in a final equilibrium state, the external pressure must be equal to the final pressure of the gas, $P_{f,A}$. If $P_{\\mathrm{ext}} > P_{f,A}$, the compression would continue. If $P_{\\mathrm{ext}} < P_{f,A}$, the gas would re-expand. Therefore, the condition $P_{\\mathrm{ext}} = P_{f,A}$ is a necessary physical requirement for the problem to be self-consistent and well-posed, not a missing piece of information.\n\nWith this interpretation, the problem is complete. It provides sufficient information to determine the final states for both paths and, subsequently, the work done along each path. The requirement to express the final ratio only in terms of $r$ and $\\gamma$ suggests that all other state variables ($n$, $T_{i}$) and constants ($C_{V}$) should cancel, which is a standard feature of such ratio-based problems in thermodynamics. A preliminary check of the derivation confirms that such cancellation is achievable.\n\nThe problem does not violate any scientific principles, is not based on false premises, contains no contradictions, and is not trivial. It requires a rigorous application of thermodynamic principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **_valid_**. A complete, reasoned solution will now be derived.\n\nThe First Law of Thermodynamics for any process is $\\Delta U = q + w$. For an adiabatic process, the heat transfer $q$ is zero ($q=0$). Therefore, the change in internal energy is equal to the work done on the system: $\\Delta U = w$.\nFor $n$ moles of an ideal gas with a constant molar heat capacity at constant volume, $C_{V}$, the change in internal energy is given by $\\Delta U = n C_{V} \\Delta T = nC_{V}(T_{f} - T_{i})$, where $T_{i}$ and $T_{f}$ are the initial and final temperatures, respectively.\nThus, for any adiabatic process on this system, the work done on the gas is $w = nC_{V}(T_{f} - T_{i})$.\n\n**Path A: Irreversible Adiabatic Compression**\nThe work done on the gas, $w_{A}$, during the compression against a constant external pressure $P_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ is:\n$$w_{A} = -\\int_{V_{i}}^{V_{f}} P_{\\mathrm{ext}}\\, dV = -P_{\\mathrm{ext}}(V_{f} - V_{i}) = P_{\\mathrm{ext}}(V_{i} - V_{f})$$\nAs established during validation, for the process to conclude at a stable final state, the constant external pressure must be equal to the final pressure of the gas for this path, $P_{f,A}$. Thus, $P_{\\mathrm{ext}} = P_{f,A}$.\n$$w_{A} = P_{f,A}(V_{i} - V_{f})$$\nFrom the First Law, we have $\\Delta U_{A} = w_{A}$, which translates to:\n$$nC_{V}(T_{f,A} - T_{i}) = P_{f,A}(V_{i} - V_{f})$$\nwhere $T_{f,A}$ is the final temperature for Path A. Using the ideal gas law for the final state, $P_{f,A}V_{f} = nRT_{f,A}$, we can write $P_{f,A} = \\frac{nRT_{f,A}}{V_{f}}$. Substituting this into the energy balance equation:\n$$nC_{V}(T_{f,A} - T_{i}) = \\frac{nRT_{f,A}}{V_{f}}(V_{i} - V_{f})$$\nThe number of moles, $n$, cancels. We also use the Mayer's relation for an ideal gas, $R = C_{P} - C_{V}$, and the definition of $\\gamma = C_{P}/C_{V}$. This gives $R = C_{V}(\\gamma-1)$.\n$$C_{V}(T_{f,A} - T_{i}) = \\frac{C_{V}(\\gamma-1)T_{f,A}}{V_{f}}(V_{i} - V_{f})$$\nThe heat capacity $C_{V}$ cancels. We introduce the compression ratio $r = V_{i}/V_{f}$.\n$$T_{f,A} - T_{i} = (\\gamma-1)T_{f,A}\\left(\\frac{V_{i}}{V_{f}} - 1\\right) = (\\gamma-1)T_{f,A}(r - 1)$$\nWe solve for the final temperature $T_{f,A}$:\n$$T_{i} = T_{f,A} - (\\gamma-1)T_{f,A}(r - 1) = T_{f,A}[1 - (\\gamma-1)(r-1)]$$\n$$T_{f,A} = \\frac{T_{i}}{1 - (r-1)(\\gamma-1)}$$\nNow, we can write the work $w_{A}$ in terms of initial state variables. It is simplest to use the expression $w_{A} = nC_{V}(T_{f,A} - T_{i})$:\n$$w_{A} = nC_{V}\\left(\\frac{T_{i}}{1 - (r-1)(\\gamma-1)} - T_{i}\\right) = nC_{V}T_{i}\\left(\\frac{1 - [1 - (r-1)(\\gamma-1)]}{1 - (r-1)(\\gamma-1)}\\right)$$\n$$w_{A} = nC_{V}T_{i}\\frac{(r-1)(\\gamma-1)}{1 - (r-1)(\\gamma-1)}$$\n\n**Path B: Reversible Adiabatic Compression**\nFor a reversible (quasi-static) process, the external pressure continuously matches the internal gas pressure, $P_{\\mathrm{ext}} = P$. The work done on the gas, $w_{B}$, is also equal to the change in internal energy, $w_{B} = \\Delta U_{B} = nC_{V}(T_{f,B} - T_{i})$, where $T_{f,B}$ is the final temperature for Path B.\nFor a reversible adiabatic process of an ideal gas, the state variables are related by $TV^{\\gamma-1} = \\text{constant}$. Applying this to the initial and final states:\n$$T_{i}V_{i}^{\\gamma-1} = T_{f,B}V_{f}^{\\gamma-1}$$\nSolving for the final temperature $T_{f,B}$ in terms of the initial temperature $T_{i}$ and the compression ratio $r = V_{i}/V_{f}$:\n$$T_{f,B} = T_{i}\\left(\\frac{V_{i}}{V_{f}}\\right)^{\\gamma-1} = T_{i}r^{\\gamma-1}$$\nSubstituting this expression for $T_{f,B}$ into the equation for work $w_{B}$:\n$$w_{B} = nC_{V}(T_{i}r^{\\gamma-1} - T_{i}) = nC_{V}T_{i}(r^{\\gamma-1} - 1)$$\n\n**Ratio of Work Done**\nWe now compute the ratio $w_{A}/w_{B}$:\n$$\\frac{w_{A}}{w_{B}} = \\frac{nC_{V}T_{i}\\frac{(r-1)(\\gamma-1)}{1 - (r-1)(\\gamma-1)}}{nC_{V}T_{i}(r^{\\gamma-1} - 1)}$$\nThe terms $nC_{V}T_{i}$ cancel from the numerator and the denominator, leaving an expression solely in terms of $r$ and $\\gamma$, as required.\n$$\\frac{w_{A}}{w_{B}} = \\frac{\\frac{(r-1)(\\gamma-1)}{1 - (r-1)(\\gamma-1)}}{r^{\\gamma-1} - 1}$$\nThis can be simplified into a single fraction:\n$$\\frac{w_{A}}{w_{B}} = \\frac{(r-1)(\\gamma-1)}{[1 - (r-1)(\\gamma-1)](r^{\\gamma-1} - 1)}$$\nThis is the final closed-form expression. The denominator term can be expanded as $1 - (r-1)(\\gamma-1) = 1 - (r\\gamma - r - \\gamma + 1) = r+\\gamma-r\\gamma$, but the factored form is equally acceptable and clear.\nFor any compression, $r > 1$, and for any physical gas, $\\gamma > 1$. Therefore, the work done in an irreversible compression against a constant external pressure is always greater than the work done in a reversible adiabatic compression between the same initial and final volumes. This is a known result in thermodynamics, which provides a sanity check for our derivation.
