Examine the case $n=\\gamma$ for a reversible adiabatic transformation of an ideal gas.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, as it deals with fundamental concepts of thermodynamics, namely pressure-volume work and polytropic processes, which are standard models in physical chemistry and engineering. It is well-posed, providing a specific path ($pV^n = \\text{const}$) for which a path-dependent quantity (work) is to be calculated. The problem is objective, using precise, universally accepted scientific terminology. It does not violate any fundamental principles, is not based on false premises, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. The constraints are clear and consistent. The requirement to analyze limiting cases serves as a verification of the derived formula against well-known results, which is a standard practice in physics. The problem is a non-trivial but standard exercise in thermodynamics.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe mechanical expansion work, $w$, done on a closed system is defined by the integral of the external pressure, $p_{\\text{ext}}$, over the change in volume, $V$. The sign convention in physical chemistry defines work done *on* the system as positive.\n$$\ndw = -p_{\\text{ext}} dV\n$$\nThus, the total work for a finite transformation from an initial volume $V_i$ to a final volume $V_f$ is given by the path integral:\n$$\nw = -\\int_{V_i}^{V_f} p_{\\text{ext}} dV\n$$\nThe problem states that the process is reversible and quasi-static. For such a process, the system is always in a state of mechanical equilibrium with its surroundings. This means the external pressure $p_{\\text{ext}}$ is at all times equal to the internal pressure $p$ of the fluid. Therefore, we can replace $p_{\\text{ext}}$ with $p$ in the integral:\n$$\nw = -\\int_{V_i}^{V_f} p dV\n$$\nThe path of the transformation is specified as polytropic, following the equation $pV^n = C$, where $C$ is a constant and the polytropic exponent $n$ is a fixed value such that $n \\neq 1$. From this relation, we can express the pressure $p$ as a function of volume $V$:\n$$\np(V) = C V^{-n}\n$$\nThe constant $C$ can be determined from the initial state of the system $(p_i, V_i)$, as this state must lie on the process path.\n$$\nC = p_i V_i^n\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $C$ and the function $p(V)$ into the work integral, we obtain:\n$$\nw = -\\int_{V_i}^{V_f} (p_i V_i^n) V^{-n} dV\n$$\nSince $p_i$, $V_i$, and $n$ are constants for the integration, we can move the term $p_i V_i^n$ outside the integral:\n$$\nw = -p_i V_i^n \\int_{V_i}^{V_f} V^{-n} dV\n$$\nThe integral of $V^{-n}$ with respect to $V$ is $\\frac{V^{-n+1}}{-n+1}$. This step is valid precisely because the problem specifies $n \\neq 1$, which prevents division by zero. Performing the definite integration:\n$$\nw = -p_i V_i^n \\left[ \\frac{V^{1-n}}{1-n} \\right]_{V_i}^{V_f} = -p_i V_i^n \\left( \\frac{V_f^{1-n} - V_i^{1-n}}{1-n} \\right)\n$$\nTo simplify this expression, we can multiply the negative sign into the denominator:\n$$\nw = p_i V_i^n \\left( \\frac{V_f^{1-n} - V_i^{1-n}}{n-1} \\right) = \\frac{p_i V_i^n V_f^{1-n} - p_i V_i^n V_i^{1-n}}{n-1}\n$$\nThe second term in the numerator simplifies to $p_i V_i^n V_i^{1-n} = p_i V_i^{n+1-n} = p_i V_i$. For the first term, we use the fact that the final state $(p_f, V_f)$ must also satisfy the polytropic relation $pV^n=C$. Thus, $p_f V_f^n = C = p_i V_i^n$. We can substitute this into the first term:\n$$\np_i V_i^n V_f^{1-n} = (p_f V_f^n) V_f^{1-n} = p_f V_f^{n+1-n} = p_f V_f\n$$\nSubstituting these simplified terms back into the expression for work gives the final closed-form result:\n$$\nw = \\frac{p_f V_f - p_i V_i}{n-1}\n$$\nThis expression is the mechanical expansion work for any reversible polytropic process with exponent $n \\neq 1$.\n\nNow, we examine the limiting cases as required.\n\nCase 1: The limit $n \\to 1$ for an ideal gas undergoing a reversible isothermal process.\nThe derived formula is indeterminate ($0/0$ form) if we directly substitute $n=1$, as for an ideal gas in an isothermal process, $pV = n_{\\text{gas}}RT = \\text{const}$, which means $p_iV_i = p_fV_f$. To evaluate the limit, we return to an intermediate form of the work expression:\n$$\nw = \\frac{p_i V_i^n V_f^{1-n} - p_i V_i}{n-1} = p_i V_i \\frac{(V_f/V_i)^{1-n} - 1}{n-1} = - p_i V_i \\frac{(V_f/V_i)^{1-n} - 1}{1-n}\n$$\nLet $x = V_f/V_i$ and $a = 1-n$. As $n \\to 1$, we have $a \\to 0$. The expression becomes:\n$$\nw = -p_i V_i \\lim_{a \\to 0} \\frac{x^a - 1}{a}\n$$\nThis limit is the definition of the derivative of the function $f(a) = x^a$ with respect to $a$, evaluated at $a=0$. The derivative is $f'(a) = x^a \\ln(x)$. At $a=0$, $f'(0) = x^0 \\ln(x) = \\ln(x)$.\nTherefore, the work in the limit $n \\to 1$ is:\n$$\nw_{n \\to 1} = -p_i V_i \\ln(x) = -p_i V_i \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_f}{V_i}\\right)\n$$\nFor an ideal gas, $p_i V_i = n_{\\text{gas}} R T_i$. Since the process is isothermal, $T_i = T$.\n$$\nw_{\\text{isothermal}} = -n_{\\text{gas}} R T \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_f}{V_i}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the correct, standard expression for the work of reversible isothermal expansion of an ideal gas, which confirms the validity of our general formula in this limit.\n\nCase 2: The reversible adiabatic transformation of an ideal gas ($n = \\gamma$).\nFor an ideal gas, a reversible adiabatic process follows the path $pV^{\\gamma} = \\text{const}$, where $\\gamma = C_p/C_v$ is the heat capacity ratio. This is a polytropic process with $n=\\gamma$. We can directly apply our derived formula:\n$$\nw_{\\text{adiabatic}} = \\frac{p_f V_f - p_i V_i}{\\gamma - 1}\n$$\nThe problem asks to relate this to state functions. For an ideal gas, the equation of state is $pV = n_{\\text{gas}}RT$. Substituting this into the work expression:\n$$\nw_{\\text{adiabatic}} = \\frac{n_{\\text{gas}}RT_f - n_{\\text{gas}}RT_i}{\\gamma-1} = \\frac{n_{\\text{gas}}R(T_f - T_i)}{\\gamma-1}\n$$\nFor an ideal gas, the universal gas constant $R$ is related to the molar heat capacities by Mayer's relation, $R = C_p - C_v$. Also, $\\gamma = C_p / C_v$, which implies $C_p = \\gamma C_v$. Substituting this gives $R = \\gamma C_v - C_v = C_v(\\gamma-1)$.\nWe substitute this expression for $R$ back into the work formula:\n$$\nw_{\\text{adiabatic}} = \\frac{n_{\\text{gas}}C_v(\\gamma-1)(T_f - T_i)}{\\gamma-1} = n_{\\text{gas}}C_v(T_f - T_i)\n$$\nThe change in internal energy, $\\Delta U$, for any process involving an ideal gas with a constant heat capacity $C_v$ is given by $\\Delta U = n_{\\text{gas}} C_v \\Delta T = n_{\\text{gas}}C_v(T_f - T_i)$.\nTherefore, we find that for this process:\n$$\nw_{\\text{adiabatic}} = \\Delta U\n$$\nThis result is consistent with the First Law of Thermodynamics, $\\Delta U = q + w$. For an adiabatic process, the heat transfer $q$ is zero ($q=0$), so the First Law reduces to $\\Delta U = w$. Our derivation correctly shows that the work done on the system is equal to the change in its internal energy, a state function. This further validates the derived expression for work.\nNonexpansion work, $w_{\\text{non-exp}}$, if present, would contribute to the change in internal energy alongside expansion work and heat, as per the full First Law: $\\Delta U = q + w_{\\text{exp}} + w_{\\text{non-exp}}$. This problem, however, focuses only on the mechanical expansion work component, $w = w_{\\text{exp}}$.\nThe derived expression $w = \\frac{p_f V_f - p_i V_i}{n-1}$ is general for any fluid undergoing a reversible polytropic process, not only for ideal gases.

Using only the first law of thermodynamics in differential form, the definition of reversible pressure-volume work, and the provided equations of state, proceed as follows:\n\n- Starting from fundamental definitions, obtain exact expressions for the reversible isothermal pressure-volume work $w_{\\mathrm{vdW}}$ for the van der Waals fluid and $w_{\\mathrm{id}}$ for the ideal gas, each written as a definite integral over $V$ and then evaluated in closed form.\n- Define the work difference $\\Delta w \\equiv w_{\\mathrm{vdW}} - w_{\\mathrm{id}}$ and reduce it to a single closed-form analytic expression that depends only on $n$, $R$, $T$, $a$, $b$, $V_{1}$, and $V_{2}$.\n- Based on your expression for $\\Delta w$, determine from first principles the condition on the parameters $a$, $b$, $T$, $V_{1}$, $V_{2}$, and $n$ under which the van der Waals reversible isothermal compression requires less work than the ideal gas at the same $n$, $T$, $V_{1}$, and $V_{2}$, and interpret this condition physically in terms of attractive interactions versus excluded-volume effects. In your discussion, explicitly connect your conclusion to the sign of the isothermal internal-energy change of a van der Waals fluid by invoking the exact identity $dU = C_{V}\\,dT + \\left[T\\left(\\dfrac{\\partial P}{\\partial T}\\right)_{V} - P\\right]\\,dV$.\n- Provide your final answer as the single closed-form analytic expression for $\\Delta w$ only. No numerical evaluation is required.\n\nUse the chemistry sign convention for work $w$ entering the first law $dU = \\delta q + \\delta w$, with $\\delta w = - P_{\\mathrm{ext}}\\,dV$ for purely pressure-volume work under a reversible mechanical constraint so that compression corresponds to $w  0$. Do not include units in your final answer and do not round; no numerical data are provided. No nonexpansion work (such as electrical or shaft work) other than pressure-volume work is performed in this process.", "solution": "This problem will be analyzed with the requisite rigor. First, we validate the problem statement.\n\nThe givens are:\n- System: A closed, simple compressible system of $n$ moles.\n- Equation of State (van der Waals): $P = \\dfrac{n R T}{V - n b} - \\dfrac{a n^{2}}{V^{2}}$, with parameters $a  0$, $b  0$.\n- Equation of State (ideal gas): $P = \\dfrac{n R T}{V}$.\n- Process: Reversible isothermal compression at constant temperature $T$.\n- Initial and Final Volumes: $V_1$ and $V_2$, with conditions $V_2  V_1$, $V_1  nb$, $V_2  nb$.\n- First Law of Thermodynamics: $dU = \\delta q + \\delta w$.\n- Reversible Work Definition: $\\delta w = -P_{\\mathrm{ext}}\\,dV$. For a reversible process, $P_{\\mathrm{ext}} = P$, so $\\delta w = -P\\,dV$. The sign convention is that work done on the system (compression, $dV  0$) is positive.\n- Thermodynamic Identity: $dU = C_{V}\\,dT + \\left[T\\left(\\dfrac{\\partial P}{\\partial T}\\right)_{V} - P\\right]\\,dV$.\n\nThe problem is scientifically grounded in classical thermodynamics, utilizing standard models (van der Waals and ideal gas equations of state) and fundamental laws. It is well-posed, providing all necessary parameters and conditions for a unique analytical solution. The language is objective and precise. The conditions $V  nb$ ensure the pressure function is well-behaved, which is a necessary physical constraint. The problem is a standard, non-trivial exercise in applying the principles of physical chemistry to compare a real gas model with an ideal gas. Therefore, the problem is valid. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe work done on a system during a reversible process is given by the integral of $\\delta w = -P\\,dV$.\n$$\nw = \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} -P\\,dV\n$$\nSince this is a compression, $V_2  V_1$, and for $P0$, the work $w$ will be positive.\n\nFirst, we calculate the work for the ideal gas, $w_{\\mathrm{id}}$. The pressure is $P_{\\mathrm{id}} = \\dfrac{n R T}{V}$.\n$$\nw_{\\mathrm{id}} = \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} -\\left(\\dfrac{n R T}{V}\\right) dV\n$$\nAs $n$, $R$, and $T$ are constant, we evaluate the integral:\n$$\nw_{\\mathrm{id}} = -n R T \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} \\dfrac{1}{V} dV = -n R T \\left[\\ln(V)\\right]_{V_1}^{V_2} = -n R T (\\ln(V_2) - \\ln(V_1))\n$$\n$$\nw_{\\mathrm{id}} = n R T (\\ln(V_1) - \\ln(V_2)) = n R T \\ln\\left(\\dfrac{V_1}{V_2}\\right)\n$$\nSince $V_1  V_2$, the argument of the logarithm is greater than $1$, so $w_{\\mathrm{id}}  0$, which is correct for compression.\n\nNext, we calculate the work for the van der Waals fluid, $w_{\\mathrm{vdW}}$. The pressure is $P_{\\mathrm{vdW}} = \\dfrac{n R T}{V - n b} - \\dfrac{a n^{2}}{V^{2}}$.\n$$\nw_{\\mathrm{vdW}} = \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} -\\left(\\dfrac{n R T}{V - n b} - \\dfrac{a n^{2}}{V^{2}}\\right) dV\n$$\nWe separate the integral into two parts:\n$$\nw_{\\mathrm{vdW}} = -n R T \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} \\dfrac{dV}{V - n b} + a n^{2} \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} \\dfrac{dV}{V^{2}}\n$$\nEvaluating these definite integrals:\n$$\n\\int_{V_1}^{V_2} \\dfrac{dV}{V - n b} = \\left[\\ln(V - n b)\\right]_{V_1}^{V_2} = \\ln(V_2 - n b) - \\ln(V_1 - n b)\n$$\n$$\n\\int_{V_1}^{V_2} \\dfrac{dV}{V^{2}} = \\left[-\\dfrac{1}{V}\\right]_{V_1}^{V_2} = -\\dfrac{1}{V_2} - \\left(-\\dfrac{1}{V_1}\\right) = \\dfrac{1}{V_1} - \\dfrac{1}{V_2}\n$$\nSubstituting these results back into the expression for $w_{\\mathrm{vdW}}$:\n$$\nw_{\\mathrm{vdW}} = -n R T (\\ln(V_2 - n b) - \\ln(V_1 - n b)) + a n^{2}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{V_1} - \\dfrac{1}{V_2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nw_{\\mathrm{vdW}} = n R T (\\ln(V_1 - n b) - \\ln(V_2 - n b)) + a n^{2}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{V_1} - \\dfrac{1}{V_2}\\right)\n$$\n$$\nw_{\\mathrm{vdW}} = n R T \\ln\\left(\\dfrac{V_1 - nb}{V_2 - nb}\\right) + a n^{2}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{V_1} - \\dfrac{1}{V_2}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we define the work difference $\\Delta w \\equiv w_{\\mathrm{vdW}} - w_{\\mathrm{id}}$.\n$$\n\\Delta w = \\left[n R T \\ln\\left(\\dfrac{V_1 - nb}{V_2 - nb}\\right) + a n^{2}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{V_1} - \\dfrac{1}{V_2}\\right)\\right] - \\left[n R T \\ln\\left(\\dfrac{V_1}{V_2}\\right)\\right]\n$$\nWe combine the logarithmic terms:\n$$\n\\Delta w = n R T \\left[\\ln\\left(\\dfrac{V_1 - nb}{V_2 - nb}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\dfrac{V_1}{V_2}\\right)\\right] + a n^{2}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{V_1} - \\dfrac{1}{V_2}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the property $\\ln(x) - \\ln(y) = \\ln(x/y)$:\n$$\n\\Delta w = n R T \\ln\\left(\\dfrac{V_1 - nb}{V_2 - nb} \\cdot \\dfrac{V_2}{V_1}\\right) + a n^{2}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{V_1} - \\dfrac{1}{V_2}\\right)\n$$\nWhich simplifies to the final closed-form expression:\n$$\n\\Delta w = n R T \\ln\\left(\\dfrac{V_2(V_1 - nb)}{V_1(V_2 - nb)}\\right) + a n^{2}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{V_1} - \\dfrac{1}{V_2}\\right)\n$$\nThe condition that the van der Waals compression requires less work is $\\Delta w  0$. We analyze the two terms in the expression for $\\Delta w$.\n\nThe argument of the logarithm is $\\dfrac{V_1V_2 - nbV_2}{V_1V_2 - nbV_1}$. Since $b  0$ and $V_1  V_2$, we have $nbV_1  nbV_2$. Therefore, the denominator is smaller than the numerator. The argument is greater than $1$, and its logarithm is positive. The first term, which is proportional to $b$ and $T$, represents the increased work due to repulsive forces (excluded volume effect) and is always positive.\n\nThe second term is $a n^{2}(\\frac{1}{V_1} - \\frac{1}{V_2})$. Since $V_2  V_1$, we have $\\frac{1}{V_1}  \\frac{1}{V_2}$, so the term $(\\frac{1}{V_1} - \\frac{1}{V_2})$ is negative. The second term, proportional to $a$, represents the reduction in work due to attractive intermolecular forces and is always negative.\n\nThe condition $\\Delta w  0$ is met when the magnitude of the negative attractive term exceeds the positive repulsive term:\n$$\n\\left| a n^{2}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{V_1} - \\dfrac{1}{V_2}\\right) \\right|  n R T \\ln\\left(\\dfrac{V_2(V_1 - nb)}{V_1(V_2 - nb)}\\right)\n$$\n$$\na n^{2}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{V_2} - \\dfrac{1}{V_1}\\right)  n R T \\ln\\left(\\dfrac{V_2(V_1 - nb)}{V_1(V_2 - nb)}\\right)\n$$\nPhysically, this means that the inward pull of attractive forces between molecules (parameter $a$) assists the compression more than the repulsive forces from finite molecular volume (parameter $b$) resist it. This condition is favored by a large value of $a$, a small value of $b$, and low temperature $T$.\n\nTo connect this to the internal energy change, we use the provided identity. For an isothermal process ($dT = 0$), the change in internal energy is:\n$$\ndU = \\left[T\\left(\\dfrac{\\partial P}{\\partial T}\\right)_{V} - P\\right]\\,dV\n$$\nThe term $(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial V})_T = T(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial T})_V - P$ is the internal pressure. For the van der Waals fluid:\n$$\n\\left(\\dfrac{\\partial P}{\\partial T}\\right)_{V} = \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial T}\\left(\\dfrac{n R T}{V - n b} - \\dfrac{a n^{2}}{V^{2}}\\right) = \\dfrac{n R}{V - n b}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the internal pressure:\n$$\n\\left(\\dfrac{\\partial U}{\\partial V}\\right)_T = T\\left(\\dfrac{n R}{V - n b}\\right) - \\left(\\dfrac{n R T}{V - n b} - \\dfrac{a n^{2}}{V^{2}}\\right) = \\dfrac{a n^{2}}{V^{2}}\n$$\nThis is a key result: the internal energy of a van der Waals fluid depends on volume only through the attractive parameter $a$. For an ideal gas, $(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial V})_T = 0$.\nThe total change in internal energy for the van der Waals fluid during isothermal compression is:\n$$\n\\Delta U_{\\mathrm{vdW}} = \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} \\left(\\dfrac{\\partial U}{\\partial V}\\right)_T dV = \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} \\dfrac{a n^{2}}{V^{2}} dV = a n^{2} \\left[-\\dfrac{1}{V}\\right]_{V_1}^{V_2} = a n^{2}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{V_1} - \\dfrac{1}{V_2}\\right)\n$$\nSince $V_2  V_1$, $\\Delta U_{\\mathrm{vdW}}$ is negative. The internal energy decreases upon isothermal compression because the molecules are forced closer, and their average potential energy becomes more negative due to attractive forces.\nObserve that this expression for $\\Delta U_{\\mathrm{vdW}}$ is exactly the second term in our expression for $\\Delta w$. Therefore, we can write:\n$$\n\\Delta w = n R T \\ln\\left(\\dfrac{V_2(V_1 - nb)}{V_1(V_2 - nb)}\\right) + \\Delta U_{\\mathrm{vdW}}\n$$\nThe condition for less work, $\\Delta w  0$, becomes $n R T \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_2(V_1 - nb)}{V_1(V_2 - nb)}\\right)  -\\Delta U_{\\mathrm{vdW}}$. Since $\\Delta U_{\\mathrm{vdW}}$ is negative, $-\\Delta U_{\\mathrm{vdW}}$ is positive.\nThis demonstrates the connection explicitly. The work difference is composed of a positive term from repulsive interactions and a negative term, $\\Delta U_{\\mathrm{vdW}}$, from attractive interactions. Less work is required for the van der Waals compression when the magnitude of the internal energy decrease (which is energy released from the system due to attractions) is greater than the extra work required to overcome the repulsions.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{n R T \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_2(V_1-nb)}{V_1(V_2-nb)}\\right) + an^2\\left(\\frac{1}{V_1} - \\frac{1}{V_2}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2661829"}]}
