We will then determine the total differential of this new potential.\n\nFirst, we validate the problem statement.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n- The system is a simple, single-component, compressible system.\n- The fundamental relation is the internal energy, $U = U(S,V,N)$, which is a homogeneous function of its extensive variables: entropy $S$, volume $V$, and particle number $N$.\n- The intensive variables are defined as:\n  $$ T \\equiv \\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial S}\\right)_{V,N}, \\quad P \\equiv -\\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial V}\\right)_{S,N}, \\quad \\mu \\equiv \\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial N}\\right)_{S,V} $$\n- The task is to perform a Legendre transform of $U$ with respect to $V$, and then find the total differential of the resulting potential in terms of the differentials $dS$, $dP$, and $dN$.\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded. The definitions provided are the standard definitions in chemical thermodynamics for a single-component system. The internal energy $U(S,V,N)$ is indeed a fundamental thermodynamic potential, and the request to perform a Legendre transform to switch from a coordinate ($V$) to its conjugate force ($P$) is a standard and well-posed procedure for generating other fundamental potentials, in this case, the enthalpy. The problem is self-contained, objective, and free from any scientific or logical contradictions.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe starting point is the total differential of the internal energy, $U(S,V,N)$. Using the chain rule for multivariate functions, we write:\n$$ dU = \\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial S}\\right)_{V,N} dS + \\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial V}\\right)_{S,N} dV + \\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial N}\\right)_{S,V} dN $$\nSubstituting the given definitions for temperature $T$, pressure $P$, and chemical potential $\\mu$:\n$$ dU = T dS - P dV + \\mu dN $$\nThis equation is the fundamental equation of thermodynamics, combining the first and second laws for a reversible process.\n\nWe are instructed to perform a Legendre transform on $U$ to replace the independent variable $V$ with its conjugate variable $P$. The conjugate pair is $(V, -P)$ because $(\\partial U / \\partial V) = -P$. The general form of a Legendre transform of a function $f(x,y)$ with respect to $x$ to a new function $g(p_x, y)$ is $g = f - x p_x$, where $p_x = \\partial f / \\partial x$.\n\nApplying this to our function $U(S,V,N)$ with respect to the variable $V$, the new potential, which we shall call $H$, is defined as:\n$$ H \\equiv U - V \\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial V}\\right)_{S,N} $$\nSubstituting the definition of pressure, $P = -(\\partial U / \\partial V)_{S,N}$:\n$$ H = U - V(-P) $$\n$$ H = U + PV $$\nThis new thermodynamic potential, $H$, is the enthalpy. By its construction, it is a function of the remaining \"passive\" variables $S$ and $N$, and the new \"active\" variable $P$. Thus, its natural variables are $S$, $P$, and $N$, i.e., $H = H(S,P,N)$.\n\nTo find the total differential of $H$, we differentiate its definition, $H = U + PV$:\n$$ dH = d(U + PV) $$\nUsing the sum rule for differentials and the product rule for $d(PV)$:\n$$ dH = dU + d(PV) = dU + P dV + V dP $$\nNow, we substitute the expression for $dU$ that we established earlier:\n$$ dH = (T dS - P dV + \\mu dN) + P dV + V dP $$\nThe terms $-P dV$ and $+P dV$ cancel each other out. This cancellation is the essential feature of the Legendre transform, which ensures the change of independent variable from $V$ to $P$ in the total differential expression.\nSimplifying the expression yields the total differential for enthalpy:\n$$ dH = T dS + V dP + \\mu dN $$\nThis expression is the total differential of $H$ expressed as a linear combination of the differentials of its natural variables, $dS$, $dP$, and $dN$. The coefficients are the conjugate variables $T = (\\partial H / \\partial S)_{P,N}$, $V = (\\partial H / \\partial P)_{S,N}$, and $\\mu = (\\partial H / \\partial N)_{S,P}$.\n\nThe problem requires the linear form of this total differential as the final answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{T dS + V dP + \\mu dN}$$", "id": "2647354"}, {"introduction": "Having seen a correct Legendre transform, it is equally instructive to analyze an incorrect one.
