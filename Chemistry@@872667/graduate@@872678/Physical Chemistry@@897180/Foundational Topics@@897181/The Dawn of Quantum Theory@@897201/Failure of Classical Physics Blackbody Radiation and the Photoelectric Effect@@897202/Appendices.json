The solution proceeds in three parts as requested.\n\nFirst, we must explain on mathematical grounds why the peaks of the spectral radiance per unit frequency, $B_{\\nu}(\\nu,T)$, and the spectral radiance per unit wavelength, $B_{\\lambda}(\\lambda,T)$, do not occur at corresponding values of frequency and wavelength. The two distributions are not simple restatements of each other but are related through a change of variables that alters the function's form. The energy radiated into a small frequency interval $[\\nu, \\nu+\\mathrm d\\nu]$ must equal the energy radiated into the corresponding wavelength interval $[\\lambda, \\lambda+\\mathrm d\\lambda]$. Since frequency $\\nu$ and wavelength $\\lambda$ are inversely related, an increase in one corresponds to a decrease in the other, so we must equate the magnitudes of the energy elements: $B_{\\nu}(\\nu,T) |\\mathrm d\\nu| = B_{\\lambda}(\\lambda,T) |\\mathrm d\\lambda|$. This implies that the functions themselves are related by the Jacobian of the variable transformation:\n$$\nB_{\\lambda}(\\lambda,T) = B_{\\nu}(\\nu,T) \\left|\\frac{\\mathrm d\\nu}{\\mathrm d\\lambda}\\right|\n$$\nGiven the relation $\\nu = c/\\lambda$, the Jacobian is:\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{\\mathrm d\\nu}{\\mathrm d\\lambda}\\right| = \\left|-\\frac{c}{\\lambda^2}\\right| = \\frac{c}{\\lambda^2}\n$$\nThus, the relationship between the two spectral radiance functions is:\n$$\nB_{\\lambda}(\\lambda,T) = B_{\\nu}(\\nu(\\lambda), T) \\frac{c}{\\lambda^2}\n$$\nTo find the maximum of $B_{\\lambda}$ with respect to $\\lambda$, we must set its derivative to zero: $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}B_{\\lambda}}{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda} = 0$. Applying the product rule and the chain rule $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}B_{\\nu}}{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}B_{\\nu}}{\\mathrm{d}\\nu}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\nu}{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}B_{\\nu}}{\\mathrm{d}\\nu}\\left(-\\frac{c}{\\lambda^2}\\right)$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}B_{\\lambda}}{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda} = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda}\\left(B_{\\nu} \\frac{c}{\\lambda^2}\\right) = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}B_{\\nu}}{\\mathrm{d}\\lambda}\\frac{c}{\\lambda^2} + B_{\\nu} \\left(-\\frac{2c}{\\lambda^3}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}B_{\\nu}}{\\mathrm{d}\\nu}\\left(-\\frac{c}{\\lambda^2}\\right)\\right)\\frac{c}{\\lambda^2} - \\frac{2c}{\\lambda^3}B_{\\nu} = 0\n$$\n$$\n-\\frac{c^2}{\\lambda^4}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}B_{\\nu}}{\\mathrm{d}\\nu} - \\frac{2c}{\\lambda^3}B_{\\nu} = 0\n$$\nThe peak of the frequency distribution $B_{\\nu}$ occurs at a frequency $\\nu^{\\ast}$ where $\\frac{\\mathrm{d}B_{\\nu}}{\\mathrm{d}\\nu} = 0$. Let us examine the condition for the peak of $B_{\\lambda}$ at the corresponding wavelength $\\lambda' = c/\\nu^{\\ast}$. At this wavelength, the first term of the equation, $-\\frac{c^2}{(\\lambda')^4}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}B_{\\nu}}{\\mathrm{d}\\nu}$, becomes zero. The equation reduces to:\n$$\n-\\frac{2c}{(\\lambda')^3}B_{\\nu}(\\nu^{\\ast}, T) = 0\n$$\nSince $B_{\\nu}$ is strictly positive at its maximum, this equation is not satisfied. This proves that the maximum of $B_{\\lambda}(\\lambda,T)$ does not occur at the wavelength $\\lambda' = c/\\nu^{\\ast}$ corresponding to the frequency maximum of $B_{\\nu}(\\nu,T)$. The mathematical reason is the non-constant factor $\\frac{c}{\\lambda^2}$, which weights the distribution differently. Maximizing a function $f(x)$ is a different problem from maximizing a function $g(x)f(x)$ unless $g(x)$ is a constant.\n\nSecond, we determine the stationarity conditions for the maxima. For $B_{\\nu}(\\nu,T)$, we introduce the dimensionless variable $x = \\frac{h\\nu}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}$. The Planck function becomes:\n$$\nB_{\\nu}(\\nu,T) = \\frac{2 h}{c^2} \\left(\\frac{k_{\\mathrm B} T}{h}\\right)^3 x^3 \\frac{1}{e^x-1}\n$$\nTo find the maximum, we need only maximize the part of the expression that depends on $\\nu$, namely $f(x) = \\frac{x^3}{e^x-1}$. Setting the derivative with respect to $x$ to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}f}{\\mathrm{d}x} = \\frac{3x^2(e^x-1) - x^3e^x}{(e^x-1)^2} = 0\n$$\nFor $x0$, this simplifies to $3(e^x-1) - xe^x = 0$, which can be rearranged to the transcendental equation:\n$$\n3 - x = 3e^{-x}\n$$\nThis is the stationarity condition for the maximizing value $x_{\\nu}^{\\ast}$.\n\nFor $B_{\\lambda}(\\lambda,T)$, we use the dimensionless variable $y = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}$. The function becomes:\n$$\nB_{\\lambda}(\\lambda,T) = \\frac{2hc^2}{\\lambda^5} \\frac{1}{e^y-1} = \\frac{2hc^2}{\\left(\\frac{hc}{yk_{\\mathrm B}T}\\right)^5} \\frac{1}{e^y-1} = \\frac{2k_{\\mathrm B}^5 T^5}{h^4 c^3} \\frac{y^5}{e^y-1}\n$$\nTo find the maximum, we maximize $g(y) = \\frac{y^5}{e^y-1}$. Setting the derivative with respect to $y$ to zero:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}g}{\\mathrm{d}y} = \\frac{5y^4(e^y-1) - y^5e^y}{(e^y-1)^2} = 0\n$$\nFor $y0$, this simplifies to $5(e^y-1) - ye^y = 0$, leading to the transcendental equation:\n$$\n5 - y = 5e^{-y}\n$$\nThis is the stationarity condition for the maximizing value, $x_{\\lambda}^{\\ast}$.\n\nThese transcendental equations must be solved numerically.\nThe solution to $3-x=3e^{-x}$ is $x_{\\nu}^{\\ast} \\approx 2.82143937$.\nThe solution to $5-y=5e^{-y}$ is $x_{\\lambda}^{\\ast} \\approx 4.96511423$.\n\nThird, we compute the required ratio.\nThe ratio of these two values is:\n$$\n\\frac{x_{\\nu}^{\\ast}}{x_{\\lambda}^{\\ast}} = \\frac{2.82143937...}{4.96511423...} \\approx 0.56825316...\n$$\nRounding to six significant figures as requested gives $0.568253$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.568253}$$", "id": "2639775"}, {"introduction": "The photoelectric effect provided incontrovertible evidence for the quantization of light, famously explained by Einstein's linear relationship between maximum electron kinetic energy and light frequency.

Use this to recover\n$$\n\\hat{\\sigma} = \\frac{m}{\\varepsilon A}.\n$$\nThen, using the relation implied by integrating Planck’s distribution over all frequencies and the emitting hemisphere, infer an expression that allows you to compute $h$ from $\\hat{\\sigma}$ together with $k_{\\mathrm B}$ and $c$, and evaluate $\\hat{h}$ numerically.\n\nUnits and numerical formatting requirements:\n- Temperatures $T$ are in kelvin ($\\mathrm{K}$), powers $P$ are in watts ($\\mathrm{W}$), areas $A$ are in square meters ($\\mathrm{m^2}$), emissivities $\\varepsilon$ are dimensionless.\n- Report $\\hat{\\sigma}$ in $\\mathrm{W\\,m^{-2}\\,K^{-4}}$ and $\\hat{h}$ in $\\mathrm{J\\,s}$.\n- For output, format every floating-point number in scientific notation to six significant figures (e.g., `1.23456e-03`).\n\nTest suite (each case lists $\\varepsilon$, $A$, temperatures $\\{T_i\\}$, and measured total powers $\\{P_i\\}$):\n- Case 1 (happy path, near-black, moderate area):\n  - $\\varepsilon = 0.98$, $A = 0.05~\\mathrm{m^2}$.\n  - $T~\\mathrm{[K]}$: $[400, 500, 600, 700, 800]$.\n  - $P~\\mathrm{[W]}$: $[61.12721469, 188.655216581875, 340.091457104176, 685.113880020931, 1133.066827390976]$.\n- Case 2 (small area, low powers, essentially black):\n  - $\\varepsilon = 1.0$, $A = 1.0\\times 10^{-4}~\\mathrm{m^2}$.\n  - $T~\\mathrm{[K]}$: $[100, 200, 300, 400]$.\n  - $P~\\mathrm{[W]}$: $[0.0015670374419, 0.0080725990704, 0.0479300327939, 0.143157581]$.\n- Case 3 (edge: high temperature, narrow range, emissivity less than unity):\n  - $\\varepsilon = 0.85$, $A = 1.0\\times 10^{-2}~\\mathrm{m^2}$.\n  - $T~\\mathrm{[K]}$: $[1000, 1020, 980, 1010, 990]$.\n  - $P~\\mathrm{[W]}$: $[482.781825615, 520.5075388531092, 445.0695094642045, 501.1522204820897, 463.5898185783018]$.\n- Case 4 (boundary: low to high $T$ span, nonblack, small additive distortions):\n  - $\\varepsilon = 0.60$, $A = 2.0\\times 10^{-2}~\\mathrm{m^2}$.\n  - $T~\\mathrm{[K]}$: $[300, 450, 650, 900]$.\n  - $P~\\mathrm{[W]}$: $[6.311603935268, 27.10249492229425, 122.96367283579426, 444.93991875672]$.\n\nYour program should compute, for each case, the pair $[\\hat{\\sigma},\\hat{h}]$ with the units specified above, format both values in scientific notation with exactly five digits after the decimal point, and produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list of these pairs enclosed in square brackets. Concretely, the output must have the form\n`[[\\hat{\\sigma}_1,\\hat{h}_1],[\\hat{\\sigma}_2,\\hat{h}_2],[\\hat{\\sigma}_3,\\hat{h}_3],[\\hat{\\sigma}_4,\\hat{h}_4]]`\nwith no spaces anywhere in the line.", "solution": "The problem requires deriving a relationship between the macroscopic Stefan-Boltzmann constant, $\\sigma$, and the fundamental constants of quantum mechanics and electromagnetism, including Planck's constant, $h$. This relationship is then used to infer $h$ from an experimental estimate of $\\sigma$.\n\n1.  **From Planck's Law to the Stefan-Boltzmann Law**: The derivation begins with Planck's law for the spectral radiance $B_{\\nu}$ (power per unit area, per unit solid angle, per unit frequency) of a blackbody at temperature $T$:\n    $$B_{\\nu}(\\nu, T) = \\frac{2 h \\nu^3}{c^2} \\frac{1}{e^{h\\nu / (k_{\\mathrm B} T)} - 1}$$\n    The spectral exitance $M_{\\nu}$ (power per unit area per unit frequency) is found by integrating the radiance over a hemisphere, which for an isotropic (Lambertian) radiator like a blackbody yields a factor of $\\pi$:\n    $$M_{\\nu}(\\nu, T) = \\pi B_{\\nu}(\\nu, T) = \\frac{2 \\pi h \\nu^3}{c^2} \\frac{1}{e^{h\\nu / (k_{\\mathrm B} T)} - 1}$$\n    The total exitance $M(T)$ is the integral of the spectral exitance over all frequencies. This integral is the Stefan-Boltzmann law, $M(T) = \\sigma T^4$.\n    $$M(T) = \\int_0^{\\infty} M_{\\nu}(\\nu, T) \\, d\\nu = \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi k_{\\mathrm B}^4}{c^2 h^3} \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} \\, dx \\right) T^4$$\n    where a substitution $x = h\\nu / (k_{\\mathrm B} T)$ has been made. The definite integral is a standard form related to the Riemann zeta function, evaluating to $\\pi^4/15$.\n    $$ \\int_0^{\\infty} \\frac{x^3}{e^x - 1} \\, dx = \\frac{\\pi^4}{15} $$\n    Substituting this result gives the total exitance:\n    $$ M(T) = \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi^5 k_{\\mathrm B}^4}{15 c^2 h^3} \\right) T^4 $$\n    By comparing this with $M(T) = \\sigma T^4$, we identify the Stefan-Boltzmann constant $\\sigma$ as:\n    $$ \\sigma = \\frac{2 \\pi^5 k_{\\mathrm B}^4}{15 c^2 h^3} $$\n\n2.  **Inferring Planck's Constant**: To find Planck's constant $h$ from an estimate of $\\sigma$, we rearrange the above equation:\n    $$ h^3 = \\frac{2 \\pi^5 k_{\\mathrm B}^4}{15 c^2 \\sigma} \\implies h = \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi^5 k_{\\mathrm B}^4}{15 c^2 \\sigma} \\right)^{1/3} $$\n    This is the key formula used in the computation.\n\n3.  **Computational Procedure**: For each experimental case, the total radiated power $P$ is modeled as $P = (\\varepsilon A \\sigma) T^4$. We define $y_i = P_i$ and $x_i = T_i^4$. The slope of the line $y=mx$ fitted through the origin is $m = \\varepsilon A \\sigma$. We first estimate the slope $\\hat{m}$ using the provided OLS formula:\n    $$ \\hat{m} = \\frac{\\sum_i x_i y_i}{\\sum_i x_i^2} $$\n    From this slope, we estimate the Stefan-Boltzmann constant:\n    $$ \\hat{\\sigma} = \\frac{\\hat{m}}{\\varepsilon A} $$\n    Finally, we use the derived relationship to compute the estimate for Planck's constant, $\\hat{h}$, from $\\hat{\\sigma}$.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Solves the blackbody radiation problem by estimating Stefan-Boltzmann\n    and Planck constants from synthetic experimental data.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define fundamental constants as per the problem statement\n    k_B = 1.380649e-23  # Boltzmann constant in J/K\n    c = 299792458.0     # Speed of light in m/s\n    pi = 3.141592653589793 # Pi\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each case: (emissivity, area, Temperatures [K], Powers [W])\n    test_cases = [\n        (0.98, 0.05,\n         np.array([400.0, 500.0, 600.0, 700.0, 800.0]),\n         np.array([61.12721469, 188.655216581875, 340.091457104176, 685.113880020931, 1133.066827390976])),\n        (1.0, 1.0e-4,\n         np.array([100.0, 200.0, 300.0, 400.0]),\n         np.array([0.0015670374419, 0.0080725990704, 0.0479300327939, 0.143157581])),\n        (0.85, 1.0e-2,\n         np.array([1000.0, 1020.0, 980.0, 1010.0, 990.0]),\n         np.array([482.781825615, 520.5075388531092, 445.0695094642045, 501.1522204820897, 463.5898185783018])),\n        (0.60, 2.0e-2,\n         np.array([300.0, 450.0, 650.0, 900.0]),\n         np.array([6.311603935268, 27.10249492229425, 122.96367283579426, 444.93991875672]))\n    ]\n\n    results_list = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        epsilon, A, T_vals, P_vals = case\n        \n        # Define x_i = T_i^4 and y_i = P_i\n        x = T_vals**4\n        y = P_vals\n        \n        # Compute the forced-through-origin OLS slope m = sum(x*y) / sum(x^2)\n        # The model is P = (epsilon * A * sigma) * T^4, so m estimates (epsilon * A * sigma)\n        sum_xy = np.sum(x * y)\n        sum_x_squared = np.sum(x**2)\n        m_hat = sum_xy / sum_x_squared\n        \n        # Estimate sigma from the slope m_hat\n        # m_hat = epsilon * A * sigma_hat => sigma_hat = m_hat / (epsilon * A)\n        sigma_hat = m_hat / (epsilon * A)\n        \n        # Infer Planck's constant h from the estimated sigma_hat.\n        # sigma = (2 * pi^5 * k_B^4) / (15 * c^2 * h^3)\n        # h^3 = (2 * pi^5 * k_B^4) / (15 * c^2 * sigma)\n        # h = ((2 * pi^5 * k_B^4) / (15 * c^2 * sigma))^(1/3)\n        numerator = 2.0 * (pi**5) * (k_B**4)\n        denominator = 15.0 * (c**2) * sigma_hat\n        h_hat = (numerator / denominator)**(1.0/3.0)\n        \n        # Format the results to scientific notation with 5 digits after the decimal point\n        sigma_str = \"{:.5e}\".format(sigma_hat)\n        h_str = \"{:.5e}\".format(h_hat)\n        \n        results_list.append(f\"[{sigma_str},{h_str}]\")\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    # e.g., [[sigma1,h1],[sigma2,h2],...]\n    final_output = f\"[{','.join(results_list)}]\"\n    print(final_output)\n\n# solve() is not called here to prevent execution in a static environment.\n# The code is provided for verification and execution by the platform.\n```", "id": "2639828"}]}
