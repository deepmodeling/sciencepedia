The system of equations simplifies to:\n$$ c_{j-1} + c_{j+1} = \\lambda c_j $$\nThis is a set of linear homogeneous difference equations. Due to the cyclic symmetry of the molecule, we can seek solutions of the form $c_j = K e^{i j \\theta}$ for some constant angle $\\theta$ and normalization constant $K$. Substituting this ansatz into the equation:\n$$ K e^{i (j-1) \\theta} + K e^{i (j+1) \\theta} = \\lambda K e^{i j \\theta} $$\nDividing by $K e^{i j \\theta}$ (which is non-zero), we obtain:\n$$ e^{-i \\theta} + e^{i \\theta} = \\lambda $$\nUsing Euler's formula, $e^{i\\theta} + e^{-i\\theta} = 2\\cos(\\theta)$, we find the expression for the reduced energies:\n$$ \\lambda = 2\\cos(\\theta) $$\nThe value of $\\theta$ is determined by the cyclic boundary condition $c_{j+6} = c_j$.
