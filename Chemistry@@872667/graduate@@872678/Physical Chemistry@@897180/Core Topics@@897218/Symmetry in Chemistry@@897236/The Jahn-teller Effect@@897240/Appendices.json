{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The Jahn-Teller theorem predicts that a non-linear molecule with a degenerate electronic state will distort to lift that degeneracy. This first practice provides a concrete visualization of this principle in action. By considering a common Jahn-Teller active system, a $d^9$ octahedral complex, you will explore how a specific geometric distortion—axial compression—directly impacts the energies of the $e_g$ orbitals, providing a foundational understanding of the connection between electronic structure and molecular geometry [@problem_id:2294591].", "problem": "An octahedral transition metal complex with a $d^9$ electronic configuration, such as $[Cu(H_2O)_6]^{2+}$, is subject to a geometric distortion known as the Jahn-Teller effect. This distortion removes the electronic degeneracy of the $e_g$ orbitals ($d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$) by either elongating or compressing the bonds along one a specific axis, conventionally chosen as the z-axis.\n\nConsider an octahedral complex undergoing an **axial compression**, where the two ligands lying on the z-axis move closer to the central metal ion compared to the four ligands in the xy-plane. Which of the following statements accurately describes the resulting relative energies of the $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals?\n\nA. The $d_{z^2}$ orbital is stabilized (lowered in energy) and the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital is destabilized (raised in energy).\n\nB. The $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital is stabilized (lowered in energy) and the $d_{z^2}$ orbital is destabilized (raised in energy).\n\nC. Both the $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals are equally raised in energy, maintaining their degeneracy.\n\nD. The complex distorts in a way that the $t_{2g}$ orbitals ($d_{xy}$, $d_{xz}$, $d_{yz}$) split in energy, while the $e_g$ orbitals remain degenerate.", "solution": "Start with the octahedral crystal field where the five metal $d$ orbitals split into two sets: the higher-energy $e_{g}$ set, $\\{d_{z^{2}}, d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\\}$, which points directly at ligands, and the lower-energy $t_{2g}$ set, $\\{d_{xy}, d_{xz}, d_{yz}\\}$, which points between ligands. In a $d^{9}$ complex, the uneven occupancy of the $e_{g}$ set leads to a Jahn-Teller distortion to remove degeneracy and lower the total electronic energy.\n\nConsider an axial compression along $z$, defined by metal–ligand distances $R_{z}R_{xy}$. The ligand–field (electrostatic plus covalent) repulsion for an orbital with electron density directed toward a ligand increases as the metal–ligand distance decreases. Qualitatively, the change in orbital energy due to ligands along a given axis is monotonic in $R^{-n}$ with $n0$, so decreasing $R_{z}$ increases the repulsion for orbitals whose lobes point along $z$ relative to those that do not. Therefore:\n- The $d_{z^{2}}$ orbital, which has lobes along the $z$ axis, experiences increased repulsion from the now-closer axial ligands, so its energy is raised (destabilized).\n- The $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbital, which lies in the $xy$ plane and interacts primarily with the equatorial ligands (at the longer $R_{xy}$ compared to $R_{z}$ in a compression), is relatively stabilized (lowered in energy) compared to $d_{z^{2}}$.\n\nThus, under axial compression the ordering becomes\n$$\nE\\!\\left(d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}\\right)E\\!\\left(d_{z^{2}}\\right),\n$$\nwhich corresponds to the statement that $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ is stabilized and $d_{z^{2}}$ is destabilized. Options asserting maintained $e_{g}$ degeneracy or exclusive $t_{2g}$ splitting are incorrect for this situation, and the reverse statement corresponds to axial elongation, not compression.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is that the $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ orbital is stabilized and the $d_{z^{2}}$ orbital is destabilized.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2294591"}, {"introduction": "While visualizing the distortion is intuitive, a more rigorous understanding requires the language of symmetry and group theory. The Jahn-Teller effect is fundamentally a consequence of vibronic coupling, where specific vibrational modes couple to the electronic state. This exercise moves beyond simple cases to a complex, modern example—the buckminsterfullerene anion ($C_{60}^-$)—to demonstrate how group theory is used to predict precisely which vibrational symmetries are responsible for inducing a degeneracy-lifting distortion [@problem_id:2294574].", "problem": "The buckminsterfullerene anion, $C_{60}^-$, is a fascinating species in materials science. It retains the high icosahedral symmetry (point group $I_h$) of its neutral parent. In neutral $C_{60}$, the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) is a triply degenerate set of orbitals with $t_{1u}$ symmetry. In the $C_{60}^-$ anion, a single electron occupies this level, resulting in a triply degenerate electronic ground state transforming as the irreducible representation $T_{1u}$.\n\nAccording to molecular orbital theory and group theory, this electronic degeneracy can be lifted by a structural distortion, a phenomenon driven by the coupling of the electronic state with specific molecular vibrations. For this first-order coupling to occur and lead to a distortion, the symmetry of the vibrational mode, $\\Gamma_{vib}$, must be one of the irreducible representations found in the decomposition of the symmetrized direct product of the electronic state's representation with itself, $[\\Gamma_{el} \\otimes \\Gamma_{el}]_{sym}$.\n\nFor the $I_h$ point group, the decomposition of the relevant symmetrized direct product is given by:\n$$[T_{1u} \\otimes T_{1u}]_{sym} = A_g \\oplus H_g$$\nA vibrational mode corresponding to the totally symmetric irreducible representation ($A_g$ in this case) will change the energy of the degenerate electronic state but will not lift the degeneracy.\n\nGiven this information, identify which of the following vibrational mode symmetries correspond to vibrations that would be active in causing a degeneracy-lifting structural distortion in the $C_{60}^-$ anion.\n\nA. $A_g$\n\nB. $G_g$\n\nC. $T_{1g}$\n\nD. $H_g$\n\nE. $T_{1u}$", "solution": "The problem asks us to identify the symmetry of the vibrational modes that can cause a degeneracy-lifting structural distortion in the $C_{60}^-$ anion.

A vibrational mode with symmetry $\\Gamma_{vib}$ is active if it meets two criteria:\n1.

In the $I_h$ point group, the totally symmetric irreducible representation is $A_g$.
