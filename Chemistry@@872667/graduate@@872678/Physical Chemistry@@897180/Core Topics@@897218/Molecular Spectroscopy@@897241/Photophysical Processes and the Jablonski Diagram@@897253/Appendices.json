We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe system is described by a three-state Jablonski diagram involving the ground singlet state $\\mathrm{S}_0$, the first excited singlet state $\\mathrm{S}_1$, and the lowest triplet state $\\mathrm{T}_1$. The depopulation of the $\\mathrm{S}_1$ state occurs via three competing first-order processes: fluorescence ($k_r$), internal conversion ($k_{nr}$), and intersystem crossing ($k_{ISC}$). The total decay rate constant for the $\\mathrm{S}_1$ state, denoted $k_{S_1}$, is the sum of the rate constants of these parallel channels:\n$$k_{S_1} = k_r + k_{nr} + k_{ISC}$$\nAccording to the provided definition, the fluorescence lifetime $\\tau_F$ is the reciprocal of the total decay rate constant of the emitting state $\\mathrm{S}_1$:\n$$\\tau_F = \\frac{1}{k_{S_1}} = \\frac{1}{k_r + k_{nr} + k_{ISC}}$$\nThe fluorescence quantum yield $\\Phi_F$ is defined as the fraction of molecules in $\\mathrm{S}_1$ that decay through the fluorescence channel. This is the ratio of the fluorescence rate constant to the total decay rate constant:\n$$\\Phi_F = \\frac{k_r}{k_r + k_{nr} + k_{ISC}} = k_r \\tau_F$$\nFrom this relationship, we can express the radiative rate constant $k_r$ in terms of the experimental observables $\\Phi_F$ and $\\tau_F$:\n$$k_r = \\frac{\\Phi_F}{\\tau_F}$$\nThe sum of the rate constants for the nonradiative decay channels from $\\mathrm{S}_1$, which are internal conversion and intersystem crossing, is given by $k_{nr} + k_{ISC}$. This sum can be found by rearranging the expression for the total decay rate:\n$$k_{nr} + k_{ISC} = k_{S_1} - k_r = \\frac{1}{\\tau_F} - \\frac{\\Phi_F}{\\tau_F} = \\frac{1 - \\Phi_F}{\\tau_F}$$\nWith the given values $\\tau_F = 4\\ \\mathrm{ns} = 4 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{s}$ and $\\Phi_F = 0.6$, we can determine the value of $k_r$ and the sum $k_{nr} + k_{ISC}$.

The total decay rate constant for the $\\mathrm{T}_1$ state, $k_{T_1}$, is:\n$$k_{T_1} = k_P + k_{nr,T}$$\nThe phosphorescence lifetime $\\tau_P$ is the lifetime of the $\\mathrm{T}_1$ state, given by the reciprocal of its total decay rate constant:\n$$\\tau_P = \\frac{1}{k_{T_1}} = \\frac{1}{k_P + k_{nr,T}}$$\nUsing the given value $\\tau_P = 1\\ \\mathrm{ms} = 1 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}$, we find the total decay rate of $\\mathrm{T}_1$:\n$$k_{T_1} = \\frac{1}{1.00 \\times 10^{-3}\\ \\mathrm{s}} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$$\nTherefore, we have the relation $k_P + k_{nr,T} = 1000\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.

The analysis will proceed from fundamental principles of molecular spectroscopy.\n\nFirst, we invoke the Born–Oppenheimer approximation, which allows for the separation of the total molecular wavefunction $\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{Q})$ into a product of an electronic wavefunction $\\phi(\\mathbf{r}; \\mathbf{Q})$ (dependent on electron coordinates $\\mathbf{r}$ and parametrically on nuclear coordinates $\\mathbf{Q}$) and a nuclear wavefunction $\\chi(\\mathbf{Q})$. For a vibronic state, this is written as $\\Psi_{ev}(\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{Q}) = \\phi_e(\\mathbf{r}; \\mathbf{Q}) \\chi_{v}(\\mathbf{Q})$.\n\nThe intensity of an electric dipole transition between an initial state $|i\\rangle = |\\phi_{S_0}\\chi_{v''}\\rangle$ and a final state $|f\\rangle = |\\phi_{S_1}\\chi_{v'}\\rangle$ is proportional to the square of the transition dipole moment integral, $\\vec{M}_{if}$:\n$$\n\\vec{M}_{if} = \\langle \\phi_{S_1}\\chi_{v'} | \\vec{\\mu} | \\phi_{S_0}\\chi_{v''} \\rangle\n$$\nwhere $\\vec{\\mu}$ is the electric dipole operator.

This allows us to factor it out of the integral:\n$$\n\\vec{M}_{if} \\approx \\vec{\\mu}_{10}(\\mathbf{Q}_{eq}) \\langle \\chi_{v'} | \\chi_{v''} \\rangle\n$$\nThe intensity of the vibronic transition from the initial vibrational state $v''$ to the final vibrational state $v'$ is thus proportional to the square of the transition dipole moment:\n$$\nI_{v''-v'} \\propto |\\vec{M}_{if}|^2 = |\\vec{\\mu}_{10}(\\mathbf{Q}_{eq})|^2 |\\langle \\chi_{v'} | \\chi_{v''} \\rangle|^2\n$$\nThe term $|\\langle \\chi_{v'} | \\chi_{v''} \\rangle|^2$ is the vibrational overlap integral squared, known as the Franck-Condon factor (FCF). It determines the relative intensities of the bands in the vibronic progression.\n\nThe problem specifies that the molecule is at cryogenic temperature, so only the ground vibrational level of the electronic ground state is populated, i.e., $v''=0$. We are interested in the ratio of intensities for the transition to $v'=1$ (the first vibronic member) and the transition to $v'=0$ (the origin band).

The problem states $\\frac{I_{0-1}}{I_{0-0}} = 0.5$.\n\nWe now use the displaced harmonic oscillator model. In this model, the potential energy surfaces for the ground ($S_0$) and excited ($S_1$) states are harmonic and have the same vibrational frequency $\\omega$, but their minima are displaced by a distance $\\Delta Q$ along a normal coordinate $Q$. The vibrational wavefunctions are the standard solutions to the quantum harmonic oscillator. For a transition originating from the $v'' = 0$ level of the ground electronic state, the Franck-Condon factors for this model are given by a Poisson distribution:\n$$\nFCF_{0-v'} = |\\langle \\chi_{v'} | \\chi_{v''=0} \\rangle|^2 = \\frac{e^{-S} S^{v'}}{v'!}\n$$\nHere, $S$ is the dimensionless Huang–Rhys factor, which quantifies the electron-vibration coupling strength. It is related to the displacement $\\Delta Q$, reduced mass $\\mu$, and vibrational angular frequency $\\omega$ by $S = \\frac{\\mu\\omega(\\Delta Q)^2}{2\\hbar}$. This Poissonian relationship is a standard result for the specified model and represents the derived connection between the quantum mechanical description and the observed spectral intensities.\n\nUsing this formula, we can express the intensity ratio $I_{0-1}/I_{0-0}$ in terms of $S$.\nFor the origin band ($0-0$ transition), $v'=0$:\n$$\nI_{0-0} \\propto FCF_{0-0} = \\frac{e^{-S} S^0}{0!} = e^{-S}\n$$\nFor the first vibronic band ($0-1$ transition), $v'=1$:\n$$\nI_{0-1} \\propto FCF_{0-1} = \\frac{e^{-S} S^1}{1!} = S e^{-S}\n$$\nThe ratio is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{I_{0-1}}{I_{0-0}} = \\frac{S e^{-S}}{e^{-S}} = S\n$$\nThis is the derived relation between the intensity ratio and the Huang–Rhys factor $S$.\n\nThe problem provides the experimental value for the intensity ratio:\n$$\n\\frac{I_{0-1}}{I_{0-0}} = 0.5\n$$\nFrom the derived relation, we immediately find the value of the Huang–Rhys factor:\n$$\nS = 0.5\n$$\nRounding to three significant figures as required, we obtain $S = 0.500$.\n\nFinally, we comment on the magnitude of the equilibrium geometry change. The Huang–Rhys factor $S$ is a direct measure of the extent of structural distortion upon electronic excitation.\n- If $S \\ll 1$, the coupling is weak, the geometry change is minimal, and the $0-0$ transition is by far the most intense.\n- If $S \\gg 1$, the coupling is strong, the geometry change is significant, and the intensity maximum of the vibronic progression is shifted to higher vibrational quantum numbers, $v' \\approx S$. The $0-0$ band becomes very weak.\n- If $S \\approx 1$, the coupling is intermediate, and the intensities of the first few bands ($v'=0, 1, 2, ...$) are comparable.\n\nIn this case, $S = 0.5$. Since $S < 1$, the most intense band in the progression is the origin band ($v'=0$), as the maximum of the Poisson distribution $P(k) = e^{-\\lambda}\\lambda^k/k!$ for $\\lambda < 1$ is at $k=0$. The intensity of the next band, $I_{0-1}$, is half that of the origin, which is a considerable fraction. This situation corresponds to weak-to-intermediate coupling. Therefore, the equilibrium geometry change upon excitation is considered to be **minor**. It is not negligible, but it is not large enough to shift the band maximum away from the $0-0$ transition. The value $S=0.5$ indicates a small but measurable displacement between the potential energy minima of the $S_0$ and $S_1$ states. The information about the progression spacing ($1500\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$) is consistent with the model of a single dominant mode but is not required for the calculation of $S$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.500}\n$$", "id": "2660704"}, {"introduction": "This final practice elevates the analysis to a level characteristic of modern research, where experimental data can be complex or seemingly contradictory.

From $\\mathrm{T_1}$, define $u = k_{\\mathrm{RISC}}/k_T$, $p = k_p/k_T$, and $t = k_{nr}^{T}/k_T$. The one-step transitions out of $\\mathrm{T_1}$ are reverse intersystem crossing with probability $u$, phosphorescence with probability $p$, and nonradiative triplet decay with probability $t$.\n\nBy first-step analysis (absorption-probability reasoning), the total probability of eventual fluorescence starting from $\\mathrm{S_1}$ satisfies\n$$\nF_S = r + i\\, F_T, \\quad F_T = u\\, F_S,\n$$\nsince fluorescence can occur immediately from $\\mathrm{S_1}$ (with probability $r$) or, if intersystem crossing occurs (probability $i$), fluorescence can still occur after returning from $\\mathrm{T_1}$ via reverse intersystem crossing (with probability $u$) and then eventually fluorescing with probability $F_S$. Solving these coupled equations yields\n$$\nF_S = \\frac{r}{1 - i\\,u}.\n$$\nSimilarly, the total probability of eventual phosphorescence starting from $\\mathrm{S_1}$ satisfies\n$$\nP_S = i\\, P_T, \\quad P_T = p + u\\, P_S,\n$$\nbecause phosphorescence only occurs from $\\mathrm{T_1}$, which is reached from $\\mathrm{S_1}$ with one-step probability $i$. Solving gives\n$$\nP_S = \\frac{i\\, p}{1 - i\\,u}.\n$$\nTherefore, the total fluorescence and phosphorescence quantum yields are $\\Phi_F = F_S$ and $\\Phi_P = P_S$, respectively. The denominator factor $(1 - i\\,u)$ accounts for the possibility of cycling between $\\mathrm{S_1}$ and $\\mathrm{T_1}$ through intersystem crossing and reverse intersystem crossing (e.g., Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) when reverse intersystem crossing is thermally activated), enhancing radiative yields.\n\nAlgorithmic design for sensitivity analysis and subset selection:\n- We denote the parameter vector as $\\mathbf{k} = [k_r, k_{nr}^{S}, k_{\\mathrm{ISC}}, k_{\\mathrm{RISC}}, k_p, k_{nr}^{T}]$ in that fixed order and the observable vector as $\\mathbf{y}(\\mathbf{k}) = [\\Phi_F(\\mathbf{k}), \\Phi_P(\\mathbf{k}), \\tau_p(\\mathbf{k})]$ with $\\tau_p$ converted to nanoseconds for comparison.\n- We operate in logarithmic parameter space to preserve positivity and express multiplicative changes naturally: $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} = \\log \\mathbf{k}$ elementwise. The Jacobian with respect to $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ is $\\mathbf{J}_{\\log}$ with entries $J_{\\alpha j} = \\partial y_\\alpha / \\partial \\log k_j$, computed numerically by symmetric multiplicative perturbations. Specifically, for a small scalar $h$ we evaluate $\\mathbf{y}$ at $k_j \\to k_j (1+h)$ and $k_j \\to k_j (1-h)$ holding other components fixed, and approximate\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{y}}{\\partial \\log k_j} \\approx \\frac{\\mathbf{y}(\\ldots,k_j(1+h),\\ldots) - \\mathbf{y}(\\ldots,k_j(1-h),\\ldots)}{2h}.\n$$\n- For a candidate subset $S$ of parameter indices, we solve the nonlinear least-squares problem\n$$\n\\min_{\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_S} \\left\\|\\mathbf{y}\\big(\\exp(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(0)} + \\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\theta})\\big) - \\mathbf{y}^{(B)}\\right\\|_2^2,\n$$\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(0)} = \\log \\mathbf{k}^{(0)}$ and $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ is zero outside $S$. We solve iteratively by Gauss–Newton: at iteration $n$, with current parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(n)}$, we compute the residual $\\mathbf{r}^{(n)} = \\mathbf{y}(\\exp(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(n)})) - \\mathbf{y}^{(B)}$ and the Jacobian $\\mathbf{J}_{\\log}^{(n)}$ restricted to columns in $S$, and solve the linear least-squares update $\\delta \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_S^{(n)} = \\arg\\min \\|\\mathbf{J}_{\\log,S}^{(n)} \\delta \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_S + \\mathbf{r}^{(n)}\\|_2^2$. We then apply a backtracking line search on the step size to ensure residual decrease, updating $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(n+1)} = \\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(n)} + \\alpha\\, \\delta \\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ with $\\alpha \\in (0,1]$. We enforce constraints that each varied parameter remains within multiplicative bounds $[10^{-3},10^{3}]$ relative to its baseline (i.e., $\\theta_j - \\theta_j^{(0)} \\in [\\log 10^{-3}, \\log 10^{3}]$), and all rates remain nonnegative.\n- We deem a subset $S$ feasible if, after iterations, the absolute residuals satisfy the tolerances $|\\Delta \\Phi_F| \\le 5\\times 10^{-4}$, $|\\Delta \\Phi_P| \\le 5\\times 10^{-4}$, and $|\\Delta \\tau_p| \\le 1\\times 10^{-2}$ ns. We search subsets by increasing cardinality and select the minimal size. Among ties, we choose the one minimizing $\\sum_{i \\in S} |\\Delta \\log k_i|$ (preferring smaller cumulative multiplicative deviation) and then the one with smallest residual norm.\n- Based on the selected $S$, we choose a recommended experiment code: if $5 \\in S$ (triplet nonradiative change, e.g., oxygen quenching), we output $0$; else if $2 \\in S$ or $4 \\in S$ (spin–orbit coupling changes), output $1$; else if $3 \\in S$ (reverse intersystem crossing implicated), output $2$; else output $3$ (time-resolved emission to separate components).\n\nTest suite and physical interpretation:\n- Baseline rates for all cases are $\\mathbf{k}^{(0)} = [2.0 \\times 10^{7}, 1.0 \\times 10^{7}, 4.0 \\times 10^{7}, 3.0 \\times 10^{5}, 1.0 \\times 10^{3}, 1.0 \\times 10^{5}]$ $\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, which yield moderate $\\Phi_F$ and a prompt lifetime $\\tau_p \\approx 14.285714$ ns.\n- Case $1$ observed $(\\Phi_F^{(B)}, \\Phi_P^{(B)}, \\tau_p^{(B)}) = (0.286197, 5.707\\times 10^{-6}, 14.285714)$ is consistent with a large increase in $k_{nr}^{T}$ (oxygen quenching), suppressing $\\mathrm{T_1}$ involvement and eliminating delayed components while leaving $\\tau_p$ unchanged. The minimal subset is expected to be $S=\\{5\\}$, recommending experiment code $0$.\n- Case $2$ observed $(0.322581, 0.258065, 9.090909)$ is consistent with enhanced spin–orbit coupling (heavy-atom effect), notably increasing $k_{\\mathrm{ISC}}$ and $k_p$, which shortens $\\tau_p$, reduces $\\Phi_F$, and increases $\\Phi_P$. The minimal subset is expected to be $S=\\{2,4\\}$, recommending code $1$.\n- Case $3$ observed $(0.328733, 0.005008, 14.285714)$ is consistent with reduced $k_{\\mathrm{RISC}}$ at lower temperature, decreasing the cycling contribution to fluorescence while leaving $\\tau_p$ (a singlet property) unchanged and $\\Phi_P$ only mildly affected. The minimal subset is expected to be $S=\\{3\\}$, recommending code $2$.\n- Case $4$ observed $(0.830551, 3.152\\times 10^{-4}, 40.0)$ displays high $\\Phi_F$ together with a long prompt lifetime, which cannot be achieved by $\\mathrm{S_1}$ radiative rate increase. A physically consistent explanation requires a slower $\\mathrm{S_1}$ depopulation (e.g., reduced $k_r$ and/or $k_{nr}^{S}$) compensated by very efficient cycling via $\\mathrm{T_1}$ (elevated $k_{\\mathrm{RISC}}$ and suppressed triplet loss), yielding strong Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence. The algorithm will identify the smallest subset $S$ whose variations reproduce the data within tolerance; typical minimal subsets include $\\{0,3\\}$ with an additional singlet nonradiative or intersystem crossing adjustment to meet all three observables. The recommended experiment code will reflect the presence of index $3$ (temperature dependence of delayed fluorescence).\n\nThe program implements all of the above, performs subset search with Gauss–Newton updates in log-space under the specified constraints, and outputs, for the four cases, the recommended experiment code followed by the sorted indices of the minimal varying-rate subset found.
