The first term, $[\\tilde{G}(1) - \\tilde{G}(0)]$, is the pure vibrational energy difference, known as the band origin, $\\tilde{\\nu}_{0}$. The rotational term values depend on the rotational constants of the respective vibrational states, which we denote as $\\tilde{B}'$ for the upper state ($v'=1$) and $\\tilde{B}''$ for the lower state ($v''=0$).

It is scientifically sound, correctly formulated, and all necessary parameters for its resolution are provided. It is therefore deemed a valid problem.\n\nThe task is to first simulate the line positions for the R-branch of a rovibrational spectrum and then to determine the rotational constants, $B'$ and $B''$, from these simulated data by means of a polynomial fit. This process emulates a common procedure used in the analysis of experimental spectroscopic data.\n\nFirst, we must establish the theoretical expression for the R-branch line positions, $\\tilde{\\nu}_R(J'')$, based on the provided foundational principles. The energy of a rovibrational level $(v, J)$ is given by the sum of the vibrational term value, $G(v)$, and the rotational term value, $F_v(J)$. The wavenumber of a transition from a lower state $(v'', J'')$ to an upper state $(v', J')$ is the difference in their term energies:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu} = [G(v') + F_{v'}(J')] - [G(v'') + F_{v''}(J'')] $$\nThis can be rearranged by collecting the vibrational and rotational parts separately. The vibrational part defines the band origin, $\\tilde{\\nu}_0 = G(v') - G(v'')$.\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu} = \\tilde{\\nu}_0 + F_{v'}(J') - F_{v''}(J'') $$\nThe rotational term value for a given vibrational state $v$ is provided as:\n$$ F_v(J) = B_v J(J+1) - D_v \\left[J(J+1)\\right]^2 $$\nwhere $B_v$ is the rotational constant and $D_v$ is the first-order centrifugal distortion constant.\n\nFor the R-branch, the selection rule is $\\Delta J = J' - J'' = +1$, which means $J' = J'' + 1$. Substituting this and the expressions for the term values into the equation for the transition wavenumber, we obtain the expression for the R-branch line positions as a function of the lower state rotational quantum number, $J''$:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu}_R(J'') = \\tilde{\\nu}_0 + \\left( B' (J''+1)(J''+2) - D' \\left[(J''+1)(J''+2)\\right]^2 \\right) - \\left( B'' J''(J''+1) - D'' \\left[J''(J''+1)\\right]^2 \\right) $$\nHere, the primes denote the upper vibrational state $v'$ (so $B' \\equiv B_{v'}$ and $D' \\equiv D_{v'}$) and double primes denote the lower state $v''$ (so $B'' \\equiv B_{v''}$ and $D'' \\equiv D_{v''}$). This equation will be used to simulate the \"experimental\" line positions for the given ranges of $J''$.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires fitting these line positions to a quadratic model as a function of a new variable, $x \\equiv J'' + 1$. The model is given as:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu}_R(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 $$\nTo connect the fitted coefficients $a_0$, $a_1$, and $a_2$ to the physical constants, we must re-express our theoretical formula for $\\tilde{\\nu}_R$ in terms of $x$. We substitute $J'' = x-1$ into the ideal rigid-rotor part of the expression (temporarily neglecting the distortion terms, as the fit model is only quadratic):\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu}_R(J'') \\approx \\tilde{\\nu}_0 + B'(J''+1)(J''+2) - B''J''(J''+1) $$\nSubstituting $x=J''+1$ gives $J''+2 = x+1$ and $J'' = x-1$:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu}_R(x) \\approx \\tilde{\\nu}_0 + B'x(x+1) - B''(x-1)x $$\nExpanding and collecting terms in powers of $x$:\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu}_R(x) \\approx \\tilde{\\nu}_0 + (B'x^2 + B'x) - (B''x^2 - B''x) $$\n$$ \\tilde{\\nu}_R(x) \\approx \\tilde{\\nu}_0 + (B' + B'')x + (B' - B'')x^2 $$\nComparing this expression with the fitting model $\\tilde{\\nu}_R(x) = a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2$, we can identify the coefficients:\n$$ a_0 \\approx \\tilde{\\nu}_0 $$\n$$ a_1 \\approx B' + B'' $$\n$$ a_2 \\approx B' - B'' $$\nThese relations are approximate because the centrifugal distortion terms, which contribute cubic and quartic terms in $x$, are ignored in the derivation, yet they are present in the simulated data. The least-squares fit will find the best quadratic approximation, and the effect of the higher-order terms will cause the fitted parameters to deviate slightly from this ideal relationship. Nevertheless, the problem requires us to use these derived relations to find the rotational constants from the fitted coefficients.\n\nWe now form a system of two linear equations for $B'$ and $B''$:\n$$ a_1 = B' + B'' $$\n$$ a_2 = B' - B'' $$\nAdding these two equations gives $a_1 + a_2 = 2B'$, which yields:\n$$ B' = \\frac{a_1 + a_2}{2} $$\nSubtracting the second equation from the first gives $a_1 - a_2 = 2B''$, which yields:\n$$ B'' = \\frac{a_1 - a_2}{2} $$\nThese are the formulas required to deduce the rotational constants from the quadratic fit coefficients. The boolean condition $B'  B''$ can be tested by comparing the unrounded numerical values obtained from these formulas. This comparison is equivalent to testing if $(a_1+a_2)/2  (a_1-a_2)/2$, which simplifies to $a_2  -a_2$, or $2a_2  0$, which is true if and only if $a_2  0$.\n\nThe computational procedure is as follows:\n1. For each test case, generate an array of integer values for $J''$ over the specified range.\n2. Calculate the corresponding array of $x$ values, where $x = J'' + 1$.\n3. Using the full expression for $\\tilde{\\nu}_R(J'')$ that includes the centrifugal distortion constants $D'$ and $D''$, calculate the simulated line positions.\n4. Perform a least-squares polynomial fit of the line positions (y-values) against the $x$ values (x-values) using a polynomial of degree $2$. This will yield the coefficients $a_2, a_1, a_0$.\n5. Use the derived formulas to calculate the fitted rotational constants $B'_{\\text{fit}} = (a_1 + a_2)/2$ and $B''_{\\text{fit}} = (a_1 - a_2)/2$.\n6. Determine the boolean value of the expression $B'_{\\text{fit}}  B''_{\\text{fit}}$.\n7.

The solution must be constructed from first principles, namely the quantum mechanical requirement of exchange symmetry for identical particles.\n\nThe total wavefunction for the diatomic molecule in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation is given as a product of electronic, vibrational, rotational, and nuclear-spin wavefunctions:\n$$\n\\Psi_{\\text{total}} = \\psi_{\\text{el}} \\psi_{\\text{vib}} \\psi_{\\text{rot}} \\psi_{\\text{ns}}\n$$\nLet $\\hat{P}_{12}$ be the permutation operator that exchanges the spatial and spin coordinates of the two identical nuclei. According to the Pauli principle, the total wavefunction $\\Psi_{\\text{total}}$ must be either symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to this exchange, depending on whether the nuclei are bosons or fermions.\n- The hydrogen nucleus (proton, $\\mathrm{H}$) has nuclear spin $I = \\frac{1}{2}$ and is therefore a fermion. The total wavefunction $\\Psi_{\\text{total}}$ for $\\mathrm{H}_2$ must be antisymmetric under nuclear exchange: $\\hat{P}_{12}\\Psi_{\\text{total}} = (-1)\\Psi_{\\text{total}}$.\n- The deuterium nucleus (deuteron, $\\mathrm{D}$) has nuclear spin $I = 1$ and is therefore a boson. The total wavefunction $\\Psi_{\\text{total}}$ for $\\mathrm{D}_2$ must be symmetric under nuclear exchange: $\\hat{P}_{12}\\Psi_{\\text{total}} = (+1)\\Psi_{\\text{total}}$.\n\nThe symmetry of the total wavefunction is the product of the symmetries of its constituent parts:\n$$\n\\hat{P}_{12}\\Psi_{\\text{total}} = (\\hat{P}_{12}\\psi_{\\text{el}}) (\\hat{P}_{12}\\psi_{\\text{vib}}) (\\hat{P}_{12}\\psi_{\\text{rot}}) (\\hat{P}_{12}\\psi_{\\text{ns}})\n$$\nLet $S_x$ denote the symmetry eigenvalue ($+1$ for symmetric, $-1$ for antisymmetric) of a component wavefunction $\\psi_x$. Then $S_{\\text{total}} = S_{\\text{el}} \\cdot S_{\\text{vib}} \\cdot S_{\\text{rot}} \\cdot S_{\\text{ns}}$.\n\nWe now analyze the symmetry of each component:\n1.  **Electronic Wavefunction ($\\psi_{\\text{el}}$)**: The electronic ground state is specified as $X\\,{}^{1}\\Sigma_{g}^{+}$. The subscript '$g$' (gerade) indicates that the electronic wavefunction is symmetric with respect to inversion of all electronic coordinates through the molecular center of mass. For a homonuclear diatomic molecule, this operation is equivalent to the permutation of the nuclei. Thus, $\\psi_{\\text{el}}$ is symmetric with respect to nuclear exchange, so $S_{\\text{el}} = +1$.\n\n2.  **Vibrational Wavefunction ($\\psi_{\\text{vib}}$)**: The vibrational wavefunction depends only on the magnitude of the internuclear distance, $R$. The exchange of nuclei leaves $R$ unchanged. Therefore, $\\psi_{\\text{vib}}$ is always symmetric with respect to nuclear exchange, so $S_{\\text{vib}} = +1$.\n\n3.  **Rotational Wavefunction ($\\psi_{\\text{rot}}$)**: The rotational wavefunction is described by the spherical harmonics, $Y_{J, M_J}(\\theta, \\phi)$. Exchanging the two nuclei at positions $\\mathbf{r}_1$ and $\\mathbf{r}_2$ is equivalent to transforming the orientation vector $\\mathbf{r} = \\mathbf{r}_1 - \\mathbf{r}_2$ to $-\\mathbf{r}$. In spherical coordinates, this corresponds to the transformation $(\\theta, \\phi) \\to (\\pi - \\theta, \\phi + \\pi)$. The effect of this parity operation on a spherical harmonic is $Y_{J, M_J}(\\pi - \\theta, \\phi + \\pi) = (-1)^J Y_{J, M_J}(\\theta, \\phi)$. Thus, $\\psi_{\\text{rot}}$ is symmetric for even rotational quantum numbers $J$ and antisymmetric for odd $J$. So, $S_{\\text{rot}} = (-1)^J$.\n\nCombining these results, the overall symmetry condition becomes:\n$$\nS_{\\text{total}} = (+1) \\cdot (+1) \\cdot (-1)^J \\cdot S_{\\text{ns}} = (-1)^J S_{\\text{ns}}\n$$\n\nNext, we must determine the number of symmetric and antisymmetric nuclear-spin states for a system of two identical nuclei, each with spin $I$. The total number of nuclear-spin states is $(2I+1)^2$. These states can be classified as symmetric or antisymmetric under the exchange of the two nuclear spins. The number of symmetric states is $g_{\\text{s}} = (I+1)(2I+1)$, and the number of antisymmetric states is $g_{\\text{a}} = I(2I+1)$.\nThe problem defines the ortho species as correlating with the symmetric nuclear-spin manifold ($S_{\\text{ns}} = +1$) and the para species with the antisymmetric one ($S_{\\text{ns}} = -1$). Therefore, the statistical weight of the ortho species is $g_{\\text{ortho}} = g_{\\text{s}}$, and that of the para species is $g_{\\text{para}} = g_{\\text{a}}$.\n\nNow we apply this framework to each molecule.\n\n**Case 1: Dihydrogen ($\\mathrm{H}_2$)**\nThe nuclei are protons, which are fermions with $I=\\frac{1}{2}$. The total wavefunction must be antisymmetric, $S_{\\text{total}} = -1$.\nThe symmetry condition is $(-1)^J S_{\\text{ns}} = -1$.\n- If $J$ is even, then $(-1)^J = +1$, which requires $S_{\\text{ns}} = -1$. The nuclear spin wavefunction must be antisymmetric. These are the para states. The statistical weight for these levels is $g_{\\text{para}} = I(2I+1) = \\frac{1}{2}(2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + 1) = \\frac{1}{2}(2) = 1$.\n- If $J$ is odd, then $(-1)^J = -1$, which requires $S_{\\text{ns}} = +1$. The nuclear spin wavefunction must be symmetric. These are the ortho states. The statistical weight for these levels is $g_{\\text{ortho}} = (I+1)(2I+1) = (\\frac{1}{2}+1)(2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + 1) = \\frac{3}{2}(2) = 3$.\n\nSo, for $\\mathrm{H}_2$, even-$J$ levels have a nuclear-spin statistical weight of $1$ (para-hydrogen), and odd-$J$ levels have a nuclear-spin statistical weight of $3$ (ortho-hydrogen).\nThe ortho-to-para statistical weight ratio is the ratio of the number of available ortho states to para states:\n$$\n\\frac{g_{\\text{ortho}}}{g_{\\text{para}}}(\\mathrm{H}_2) = \\frac{3}{1} = 3\n$$\n\n**Case 2: Dideuterium ($\\mathrm{D}_2$)**\nThe nuclei are deuterons, which are bosons with $I=1$. The total wavefunction must be symmetric, $S_{\\text{total}} = +1$.\nThe symmetry condition is $(-1)^J S_{\\text{ns}} = +1$.\n- If $J$ is even, then $(-1)^J = +1$, which requires $S_{\\text{ns}} = +1$. The nuclear spin wavefunction must be symmetric. These are the ortho states. The statistical weight for these levels is $g_{\\text{ortho}} = (I+1)(2I+1) = (1+1)(2 \\cdot 1 + 1) = 2(3) = 6$.\n- If $J$ is odd, then $(-1)^J = -1$, which requires $S_{\\text{ns}} = -1$. The nuclear spin wavefunction must be antisymmetric. These are the para states. The statistical weight for these levels is $g_{\\text{para}} = I(2I+1) = 1(2 \\cdot 1 + 1) = 1(3) = 3$.\n\nSo, for $\\mathrm{D}_2$, even-$J$ levels have a nuclear-spin statistical weight of $6$ (ortho-deuterium), and odd-$J$ levels have a nuclear-spin statistical weight of $3$ (para-deuterium).\nThe ortho-to-para statistical weight ratio is:\n$$\n\\frac{g_{\\text{ortho}}}{g_{\\text{para}}}(\\mathrm{D}_2) = \\frac{6}{3} = 2\n$$\n\nThe final answer is the ordered pair of these ratios for $\\mathrm{H}_2$ and $\\mathrm{D}_2$.\nThe ratio for $\\mathrm{H}_2$ is $3$.\nThe ratio for $\\mathrm{D}_2$ is $2$.\nThe ordered pair is $(3, 2)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n3  2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2667095"}]}
