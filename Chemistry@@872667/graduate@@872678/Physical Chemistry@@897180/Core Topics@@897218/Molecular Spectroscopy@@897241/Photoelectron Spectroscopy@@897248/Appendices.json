Mastering this simple calculation, as shown in [@problem_id:2010474], is the first step towards interpreting any photoelectron spectrum.", "problem": "An experimental physicist is conducting a study on the electronic structure of noble gases using a technique called Photoelectron Spectroscopy (PES). In this experiment, a sample of gaseous argon is irradiated with monochromatic ultraviolet light from a He(I) discharge lamp. The energy of each photon from this source is precisely known to be $h\\nu = 21.22$ eV. The interaction of a photon with an argon atom can cause an electron to be ejected. A spectrometer then measures the kinetic energy of these ejected photoelectrons. The analysis of the resulting spectrum reveals that the photoelectrons with the highest kinetic energy have a measured energy of $E_k = 5.46$ eV. These high-energy electrons originate from the least tightly bound orbital of the argon atom. Using this experimental data, calculate the first ionization energy of argon.\n\nExpress your answer in electron-volts (eV), rounded to four significant figures.", "solution": "The governing relation for photoelectron spectroscopy follows from energy conservation (Einstein photoelectric equation applied to bound electrons): the photon energy equals the sum of the kinetic energy of the ejected electron and its binding energy.

This practice explores how spin-orbit coupling, a fundamental quantum mechanical effect, splits core-level peaks into doublets. You will apply principles of angular momentum to predict the theoretical intensity ratio of these split peaks based on their electronic degeneracy, a classic and powerful method for assigning spectral features as demonstrated in [@problem_id:2010434].", "problem": "An experiment using X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) is performed on a pure gold (Au) sample to study its core-level electronic structure. A high-resolution scan of the energy region corresponding to the 4f orbitals reveals that the peak is not a single feature, but is split into a doublet due to spin-orbit coupling. According to the standard model of photoionization for core levels, the integrated intensity of each peak in this doublet is directly proportional to the total electronic degeneracy of the final state (i.e., the hole state) it represents. Based on this principle, determine the expected theoretical intensity ratio of the peak observed at the lower binding energy to the peak observed at the higher binding energy.\n\nSelect the correct ratio from the options below.\n\nA. $3 : 4$\n\nB. $4 : 3$\n\nC. $2 : 3$\n\nD. $3 : 2$\n\nE. $1 : 2$\n\nF. $1 : 1$", "solution": "The problem asks for the theoretical intensity ratio of the two peaks arising from the spin-orbit splitting of the 4f core level in gold.\n\nStep 1: Identify the relevant quantum numbers for a 4f electron.\nFor an electron in a 4f orbital, the principal quantum number is $n=4$, and the orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=3$. All electrons have a spin angular momentum quantum number of $s=1/2$.\n\nStep 2: Determine the total angular momentum quantum numbers due to spin-orbit coupling.\nSpin-orbit coupling involves the vector addition of the orbital angular momentum $\\vec{L}$ and the spin angular momentum $\\vec{S}$ to form the total angular momentum $\\vec{J} = \\vec{L} + \\vec{S}$. The magnitude of this total angular momentum is quantized by the total angular momentum quantum number, $j$. The possible values of $j$ are given by the Clebsch-Gordan series:\n$$j = |l-s|, |l-s|+1, \\dots, l+s$$\nFor a 4f electron with $l=3$ and $s=1/2$, the possible values for $j$ are:\n$$j = |3 - \\frac{1}{2}|, \\dots, 3 + \\frac{1}{2}$$\n$$j = \\frac{5}{2}, \\frac{7}{2}$$\nThis means the 4f level splits into two distinct sublevels, which are commonly denoted as $4f_{5/2}$ and $4f_{7/2}$.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the degeneracy of each sublevel.\nThe degeneracy of a state with a given total angular momentum quantum number $j$ is given by the formula $g_j = 2j+1$. This counts the number of possible projections of the total angular momentum vector onto a quantization axis.\nFor the $j=5/2$ sublevel:\n$$g_{5/2} = 2\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right) + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6$$\nFor the $j=7/2$ sublevel:\n$$g_{7/2} = 2\\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right) + 1 = 7 + 1 = 8$$\nSo, the 4f level, which initially has a total degeneracy of $2(2l+1) = 2(2(3)+1) = 14$ electrons, splits into a sublevel that can hold 6 electrons and another that can hold 8 electrons.\n\nStep 4: Relate the sublevels to the binding energies of the XPS peaks.\nIn atoms, spin-orbit coupling rules (part of Hund's rules for term symbols) state that for a subshell that is less than half-filled, the level with the lowest $j$ is lowest in energy. For a subshell that is more than half-filled, the level with the highest $j$ is lowest in energy. Photoemission creates a \"hole\" in a filled core shell. A filled shell corresponds to the \"more than half-filled\" case. Therefore, the final state with the hole in the $j=7/2$ level is more stable (lower in energy) than the final state with the hole in the $j=5/2$ level. A more stable final state requires less energy to create, which corresponds to a lower binding energy for the ejected photoelectron.\nThus:\n- The peak at lower binding energy corresponds to the $4f_{7/2}$ final state.\n- The peak at higher binding energy corresponds to the $4f_{5/2}$ final state.\n\nStep 5: Calculate the intensity ratio.\nThe problem states that the intensity of each peak is proportional to the degeneracy of its corresponding final state. We need to find the ratio of the intensity of the lower-binding-energy peak to the higher-binding-energy peak.\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{I(\\text{lower binding energy})}{I(\\text{higher binding energy})} = \\frac{I(4f_{7/2})}{I(4f_{5/2})} $$\nUsing the degeneracies calculated in Step 3:\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{g_{7/2}}{g_{5/2}} = \\frac{8}{6} $$\nSimplifying the fraction gives:\n$$ \\text{Ratio} = \\frac{4}{3} $$\nThis corresponds to an intensity ratio of $4:3$.\n\nStep 6: Match the result to the given options.\nThe calculated ratio $4:3$ matches option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2010434"}, {"introduction": "A measured photoelectron peak is a convolution of intrinsic physical effects and instrumental limitations, resulting in a specific lineshape.
