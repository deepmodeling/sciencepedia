It is a standard, well-posed problem in physical chemistry.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Rate Law**\n\nThe rate of formation of product $B$, denoted $r_{B}$, is equivalent to the time derivative of its concentration, $\\frac{d[B]}{dt}$. Based on the stoichiometry of the provided elementary steps, species $B$ is formed only in the propagation step:\n$$R + A \\to R + B$$\nAccording to the law of mass action, the rate of this elementary step is given by $k_{p}[R][A]$. Therefore, the rate of formation of $B$ is:\n$$r_{B} = \\frac{d[B]}{dt} = k_{p}[R][A]$$\nThis expression contains the concentration of the reactive intermediate, $[R]$, which is not a measurable parameter. To obtain a closed-form expression in terms of the given parameters, we must determine $[R]$ by applying the quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA).\n\nThe QSSA posits that for a highly reactive, short-lived intermediate, its concentration rapidly reaches a state where its rate of formation is balanced by its rate of consumption. Mathematically, this is expressed as $\\frac{d[R]}{dt} \\approx 0$. We must first write the full rate expression for the species $R$.\n\n$R$ is formed in the initiation step and consumed in the termination step. In the propagation step, one molecule of $R$ is consumed and one is produced, resulting in no net change in the concentration of $R$.\n\n1.  **Rate of formation of R from Initiation ($I \\to 2R$)**:\n    The rate of this reaction is $k_{i}[I]$. Since two molecules of $R$ are produced for each molecule of $I$ that reacts, the rate of change of $[R]$ from this step is $+2k_{i}[I]$.\n\n2.  **Rate of change of R from Propagation ($R + A \\to R + B$)**:\n    The rate of this reaction is $k_{p}[R][A]$. One molecule of $R$ is consumed and one is produced, so the net rate of change of $[R]$ from this step is $-k_{p}[R][A] + k_{p}[R][A] = 0$.\n\n3.  **Rate of consumption of R from Termination ($2R \\to T$)**:\n    The rate of this reaction is $k_{t}[R]^2$. Since two molecules of $R$ are consumed, the rate of change of $[R]$ from this step is $-2k_{t}[R]^2$.\n\nCombining these contributions, the net rate of change of the concentration of the intermediate $R$ is:\n$$\\frac{d[R]}{dt} = (\\text{rate of formation}) - (\\text{rate of consumption})$$\n$$\\frac{d[R]}{dt} = 2k_{i}[I] - 2k_{t}[R]^2$$\nNow, we apply the QSSA by setting $\\frac{d[R]}{dt} = 0$:\n$$2k_{i}[I] - 2k_{t}[R]_{ss}^2 = 0$$\nwhere $[R]_{ss}$ denotes the steady-state concentration of the intermediate.\n\nWe solve this algebraic equation for $[R]_{ss}$:\n$$2k_{t}[R]_{ss}^2 = 2k_{i}[I]$$\n$$[R]_{ss}^2 = \\frac{k_{i}[I]}{k_{t}}$$\nSince concentration must be a non-negative quantity, we take the positive square root:\n$$[R]_{ss} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{i}[I]}{k_{t}}}$$\nThis expression gives the steady-state concentration of the radical intermediate $R$ in terms of the known parameters.\n\nFinally, we substitute this expression for $[R]_{ss}$ back into the rate law for the formation of $B$:\n$$r_{B} = k_{p}[A][R]_{ss}$$\n$$r_{B} = k_{p}[A]\\sqrt{\\frac{k_{i}[I]}{k_{t}}}$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for the rate of formation of product $B$. It can be rearranged to group constants and concentrations separately:\n$$r_{B} = k_{p}\\sqrt{\\frac{k_{i}}{k_{t}}}[A][I]^{1/2}$$\nThe rate of production is first-order with respect to $[A]$ and half-order with respect to the initiator concentration $[I]$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{k_{p}[A]\\sqrt{\\frac{k_{i}[I]}{k_{t}}}}\n$$", "id": "2631173"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the basic QSSA, this problem introduces a more realistic scenario where multiple termination pathways compete.

The problem is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe central species is the radical intermediate, $X$. The time evolution of its concentration, $[X]$, is governed by the rates of its formation (initiation) and its consumption (termination). We are given that propagation steps do not result in a net change in $[X]$.\n\nThe rate of change of the concentration of $X$ is given by the differential rate law:\n$$\n\\frac{d[X]}{dt} = (\\text{rate of formation of } X) - (\\text{rate of consumption of } X)\n$$\n\nAccording to the problem statement:\n$1$.

The rate of this reaction is proportional to $[X]^2$. It is crucial to recognize that for each reaction event, two radicals of species $X$ are consumed. Therefore, the rate of consumption of the species $X$ via this channel is twice the rate of the reaction.\n$$\n\\text{Rate}_{\\text{bi}} = 2 k_t [X]^2\n$$\nThe total rate of consumption of $X$ is the sum of the rates of the two termination channels.\n$$\n\\text{Rate of Consumption} = \\text{Rate}_{\\text{uni}} + \\text{Rate}_{\\text{bi}} = k_d [X] + 2 k_t [X]^2\n$$\n\nCombining the formation and consumption terms, we construct the complete differential equation for $[X]$:\n$$\n\\frac{d[X]}{dt} = R_i - \\left( k_d [X] + 2 k_t [X]^2 \\right) = R_i - k_d [X] - 2 k_t [X]^2\n$$\n\nThe problem requires the application of the quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA) for the radical concentration $[X]$. The QSSA asserts that for a highly reactive intermediate, its rate of formation is approximately equal to its rate of consumption, leading to a near-zero net rate of change of its concentration.\n$$\n\\frac{d[X]}{dt} \\approx 0\n$$\nApplying this approximation to our system yields the algebraic equation for the steady-state radical concentration, $[X]_{\\text{ss}}$:\n$$\nR_i - k_d [X]_{\\text{ss}} - 2 k_t [X]_{\\text{ss}}^2 = 0\n$$\nTo solve for $[X]_{\\text{ss}}$, we rearrange this equation into the standard quadratic form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where $x = [X]_{\\text{ss}}$:\n$$\n2 k_t [X]_{\\text{ss}}^2 + k_d [X]_{\\text{ss}} - R_i = 0\n$$\nWe solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, $[X]_{\\text{ss}} = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$, with coefficients $a = 2k_t$, $b = k_d$, and $c = -R_i$.\n$$\n[X]_{\\text{ss}} = \\frac{-k_d \\pm \\sqrt{k_d^2 - 4(2k_t)(-R_i)}}{2(2k_t)} = \\frac{-k_d \\pm \\sqrt{k_d^2 + 8k_t R_i}}{4k_t}\n$$\nSince concentration is a physical quantity, it must be non-negative. The rate constants $k_t$, $k_d$ and the initiation rate $R_i$ are all positive quantities. The term under the square root, $\\sqrt{k_d^2 + 8k_t R_i}$, is strictly greater than $\\sqrt{k_d^2} = k_d$. Consequently, the numerator with the minus sign, $-k_d - \\sqrt{k_d^2 + 8k_t R_i}$, would yield a negative, physically meaningless result. We must therefore select the positive root.\n$$\n[X]_{\\text{ss}} = \\frac{-k_d + \\sqrt{k_d^2 + 8k_t R_i}}{4k_t}\n$$\nThis is the required expression for the steady-state radical concentration.\n\nNext, we must find the crossover radical concentration, $X_c$, defined as the concentration at which the instantaneous rate of radical consumption by unimolecular deactivation equals that by bimolecular recombination.
