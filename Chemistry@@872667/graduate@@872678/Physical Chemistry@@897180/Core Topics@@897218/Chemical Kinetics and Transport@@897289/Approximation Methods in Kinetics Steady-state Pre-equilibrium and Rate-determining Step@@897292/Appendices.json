It is a canonical problem in chemical kinetics that requires the application of fundamental principles. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe solution requires three distinct components: the derivation of the rate equations, the specification of initial conditions, and the analysis of approximation regimes.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Mass-Action Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)**\n\nThe reaction mechanism consists of three elementary steps:\n1. $A \\xrightarrow{k_1} I$\n2. $I \\xrightarrow{k_{-1}} A$\n3. $I \\xrightarrow{k_2} P$\n\nApplying the law of mass action to each species:\n\n- **Species A**: It is consumed in the first step with rate $k_1[A]$ and produced in the second step with rate $k_{-1}[I]$. The net rate of change of the concentration of $A$, $[A]$, is therefore:\n$$\n\\frac{d[A]}{dt} = -k_1[A] + k_{-1}[I]\n$$\n\n- **Species I**: It is an intermediate. It is produced in the first step with rate $k_1[A]$ and consumed in the second and third steps with rates $k_{-1}[I]$ and $k_2[I]$, respectively. The net rate of change of the concentration of $I$, $[I]$, is:\n$$\n\\frac{d[I]}{dt} = k_1[A] - k_{-1}[I] - k_2[I] = k_1[A] - (k_{-1} + k_2)[I]\n$$\n\n- **Species P**: It is the final product, formed only in the third step with rate $k_2[I]$. The net rate of change of the concentration of $P$, $[P]$, is:\n$$\n\\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_2[I]\n$$\n\nThus, the correct system of ODEs is:\n$$\n\\frac{d[A]}{dt} = -k_1[A] + k_{-1}[I]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d[I]}{dt} = k_1[A] - (k_{-1} + k_2)[I]\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_2[I]\n$$\n\n**Part 2: Initial Conditions**\n\nThe problem specifies that the reactor is \"charged at $t=0$ with $A$ only\". This implies that at the beginning of the reaction ($t=0$), the only species present is the reactant $A$. Let its initial concentration be $[A]_0$. This concentration must be positive for any reaction to occur, so $[A]_0 > 0$. The initial concentrations of the intermediate $I$ and the product $P$ must be zero.\n\nTherefore, the correct minimal and self-consistent set of initial conditions is:\n$$\n[A](0) = [A]_0 > 0, \\quad [I](0) = 0, \\quad [P](0) = 0\n$$\n\n**Part 3: Approximation Regimes and Overall Rate Laws**\n\nThe overall rate of product formation is $v(t) = \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_2[I]$. To express this in terms of the reactant concentration $[A]$, we must find an approximate expression for $[I]$.\n\n**a) The Steady-State Approximation (SSA) for the intermediate $I$**\n\nThe SSA is applicable when the intermediate $I$ is highly reactive and its concentration remains low and nearly constant throughout most of the reaction, i.e., $\\frac{d[I]}{dt} \\approx 0$. This approximation is valid when the rate of consumption of the intermediate is much greater than its rate of formation, which for this system corresponds to the condition $k_{-1} + k_2 \\gg k_1$.\n\nSetting $\\frac{d[I]}{dt} = 0$:\n$$\nk_1[A] - (k_{-1} + k_2)[I]_{ss} \\approx 0\n$$\nSolving for the steady-state concentration of $I$, denoted $[I]_{ss}$:\n$$\n[I]_{ss} \\approx \\frac{k_1}{k_{-1} + k_2}[A]\n$$\nSubstituting this into the rate law for $P$:\n$$\nv(t) = k_2[I]_{ss} \\approx k_2 \\left( \\frac{k_1}{k_{-1} + k_2} \\right) [A](t) = \\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_{-1} + k_2}[A](t)\n$$\n\n**b) The Pre-Equilibrium Approximation (PEA) for the step $A \\rightleftharpoons I$**\n\nThe PEA is applicable when the first reversible step is very fast compared to the subsequent product formation step. This means the rates of the forward and reverse reactions of the first step are much larger than the rate of the second step, establishing a rapid equilibrium. The condition for this is $k_1 \\gg k_2$ and $k_{-1} \\gg k_2$.\n\nUnder this condition, the first step is assumed to be at equilibrium:\n$$\nk_1[A] \\approx k_{-1}[I]\n$$\nSolving for the pre-equilibrium concentration of $I$, denoted $[I]_{pe}$:\n$$\n[I]_{pe} \\approx \\frac{k_1}{k_{-1}}[A]\n$$\nThe overall rate is determined by the slow, rate-determining step, $I \\xrightarrow{k_2} P$:\n$$\nv(t) = k_2[I]_{pe} \\approx k_2 \\left( \\frac{k_1}{k_{-1}} \\right) [A](t) = \\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_{-1}}[A](t)\n$$\nNote that the PEA is a limiting case of the SSA. If $k_{-1} \\gg k_2$, the SSA expression $v(t) \\approx \\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_{-1} + k_2}[A](t)$ simplifies to $v(t) \\approx \\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_{-1}}[A](t)$, which is the PEA result.\n\n**Evaluation of Provided Options**\n\n- **Option A**:\n  - ODEs: The set of ODEs provided, $\\frac{d[A]}{dt}=-k_1[A]+k_{-1}[I]$, $\\frac{d[I]}{dt}=k_1[A]-(k_{-1}+k_2)[I]$, and $\\frac{d[P]}{dt}=k_2[I]$, is identical to our derivation. **Correct**.\n  - Initial conditions: The set $[A](0)=[A]_0>0, \\;[I](0)=0, \\;[P](0)=0$ matches our derivation. **Correct**.\n  - Regimes and overall rates:\n    - The PEA is correctly identified for the regime $k_1, k_{-1} \\gg k_2$, with the correct rate law $v(t)\\approx \\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_{-1}}[A](t)$. **Correct**.\n    - The SSA is correctly identified for the regime $k_{-1}+k_2 \\gg k_1$, with the correct rate law $v(t)\\approx \\frac{k_1 k_2}{k_{-1}+k_2}[A](t)$. **Correct**.\n  - Verdict: **Correct**.\n\n- **Option B**:\n  - ODEs: The rate equation for $[A]$ is $\\frac{d[A]}{dt}=-k_1[A]-k_{-1}[I]$, which is incorrect as the term for the reverse reaction must be positive ($+k_{-1}[I]$). The equation for $[I]$ is also incorrect. **Incorrect**.\n  - Initial conditions: The condition $[P](0)=[A]_0$ contradicts the problem statement that the reactor is charged with $A$ only. **Incorrect**.\n  - Regimes and overall rates: The conditions and rate laws presented for both PEA and SSA are fundamentally flawed, confusing the conditions and resulting expressions. For example, the condition for PEA is given as $k_2\\gg k_{-1}$ and $k_2\\gg k_1$, which describes a scenario where the first step is rate-limiting, not a pre-equilibrium. **Incorrect**.\n  - Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n- **Option C**:\n  - ODEs: The set of ODEs is correct. **Correct**.\n  - Initial conditions: The condition $[I](0)=[A]_0$ contradicts the problem statement that the reactor is charged with $A$ only. **Incorrect**.\n  - Regimes and overall rates: The labels for the PEA and SSA regimes are swapped. The condition $k_1, k_{-1} \\gg k_2$ corresponds to PEA, not SSA. The condition $k_{-1}+k_2 \\gg k_1$ corresponds to SSA, not PEA. **Incorrect**.\n  - Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n- **Option D**:\n  - ODEs: The rate equation for $[I]$ contains a sign error ($+k_2[I]$ instead of $-k_2[I]$). The rate equation for $[P]$ is also incorrect ($-k_2[I]$ instead of $+k_2[I]$). **Incorrect**.\n  - Initial conditions: The set of initial conditions is correct. **Correct**.\n  - Regimes and overall rates: The analysis is flawed. For pre-equilibrium, the condition is incomplete ($k_{-1}\\gg k_2$ alone is not sufficient), and the rate law is incorrect (missing a factor of $k_1$). For the steady-state, the condition given is a special case, not the general one, and the rate law is also missing the factor $k_1$. **Incorrect**.\n  - Verdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on a thorough analysis of all components, only option A is correct in its entirety.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2624187"}, {"introduction": "The steady-state approximation rests on the idea that a reactive intermediate reaches its quasi-steady concentration very quickly.
