We proceed by deriving the relationship between these conventions from first principles.\n\nThe condition for liquid-vapor phase equilibrium for any component $i$ is the equality of its chemical potential, or equivalently, its fugacity, in both phases:\n$$ f_i^\\ell (T, P, \\{x_j\\}) = f_i^v (T, P, \\{y_j\\}) $$\nwhere $f_i^\\ell$ and $f_i^v$ are the fugacities of component $i$ in the liquid and vapor phases, respectively, at temperature $T$ and total pressure $P$. The liquid composition is given by mole fractions $\\{x_j\\}$ and vapor by $\\{y_j\\}$.\n\nThe problem states that the vapor phase is ideal. For an ideal gas mixture, the fugacity of a component is equal to its partial pressure:\n$$ f_i^v = p_i = y_i P $$\nThus, for our solute $B$, the equilibrium condition becomes:\n$$ f_B^\\ell = p_B $$\nThe liquid-phase fugacity $f_B^\\ell$ can be expressed using different activity conventions and standard states. The activity $a_i$ is defined by $f_i^\\ell = a_i f_i^\\ominus$, where $f_i^\\ominus$ is the standard-state fugacity. The activity is related to mole fraction via an activity coefficient, $a_i = \\gamma_i x_i$.\n\nLet us analyze the two standard states given for the solute $B$.\n\n1.  **Raoult Standard State:**\n    The standard state is pure liquid $B$ at the system temperature $T$ and pressure $P$. The standard-state fugacity is $f_B^{\\ominus,R} = f_B^{\\text{pure liquid}}(T,P)$. The problem assumes the Poynting correction is negligible, so the fugacity of the pure liquid at pressure $P$ is approximately equal to its fugacity at its saturation vapor pressure, $p_B^\\ast(T)$. For an ideal vapor, this is simply $p_B^\\ast(T)$. Thus, we can write:\n    $$ f_B^{\\ominus,R} \\approx p_B^\\ast(T) $$\n    The liquid-phase fugacity of $B$ is then expressed as:\n    $$ f_B^\\ell = a_B \\cdot f_B^{\\ominus,R} = (\\gamma_B x_B) p_B^\\ast(T) $$\n    The Raoult-scale activity coefficient $\\gamma_B$ is defined by the limit: $\\gamma_B \\to 1$ as $x_B \\to 1$.\n\n2.  **Henry Standard State:**\n    The standard state is a hypothetical state where the standard-state fugacity is the Henry's law constant for solute $B$ in solvent $A$ at the system $T$ and $P$.\n    $$ f_B^{\\ominus,H} = K_B(T,P;A) $$\n    The liquid-phase fugacity of $B$ is expressed as:\n    $$ f_B^\\ell = a_B^{(H)} \\cdot f_B^{\\ominus,H} = (\\gamma_B^{(H)} x_B) K_B(T,P;A) $$\n    The Henry-scale activity coefficient $\\gamma_B^{(H)}$ is defined by the limit: $\\gamma_B^{(H)} \\to 1$ as $x_B \\to 0$.\n\n**Connecting the Standard States:**\nThe fugacity of component $B$ in the liquid, $f_B^\\ell$, is a physical property of the state of the system and does not depend on the convention used to describe it. Therefore, we can equate the two expressions for $f_B^\\ell$:\n$$ (\\gamma_B x_B) p_B^\\ast(T) = (\\gamma_B^{(H)} x_B) K_B(T,P;A) $$\nFor any non-zero concentration of $B$ ($x_B > 0$), we can divide by $x_B$:\n$$ \\gamma_B p_B^\\ast(T) = \\gamma_B^{(H)} K_B(T,P;A) $$\nThis equation provides the general relationship between the two activity coefficients. To find the relationship between the standard-state fugacities, $p_B^\\ast$ and $K_B$, we examine the limit of infinite dilution, $x_B \\to 0$:\n$$ \\lim_{x_B \\to 0} \\left( \\gamma_B p_B^\\ast(T) \\right) = \\lim_{x_B \\to 0} \\left( \\gamma_B^{(H)} K_B(T,P;A) \\right) $$\nBy their definitions:\n-   $\\lim_{x_B \\to 0} \\gamma_B = \\gamma_B^\\infty$, where $\\gamma_B^\\infty$ is the infinite-dilution activity coefficient on the Raoult scale.\n-   $\\lim_{x_B \\to 0} \\gamma_B^{(H)} = 1$.\nSubstituting these limits into the equation yields:\n$$ \\gamma_B^\\infty \\cdot p_B^\\ast(T) = 1 \\cdot K_B(T,P;A) $$\n$$ K_B(T,P;A) = \\gamma_B^\\infty p_B^\\ast(T) $$\nThis is the fundamental relationship connecting the Henry's constant to the Raoult's law framework. Now, we evaluate each statement.\n\n**Option A:** In the Raoult standard state for $B$, $a_B = f_B^{\\ell} / f_B^\\ast$ with $f_B^\\ast$ the fugacity of pure liquid $B$ at the same $T,P$, and the Raoult-scale activity coefficient $\\gamma_B$ satisfies $\\gamma_B \\to 1$ as $x_B \\to 1$. In the Henry standard state for $B$ in $A$, $a_B^{(H)} = f_B^{\\ell} / K_B$ with $K_B = K_B(T,P;A)$, and the Henry-scale activity coefficient satisfies $\\gamma_B^{(H)} \\to 1$ as $x_B \\to 0$.\nThis statement is a precise and correct summary of the definitions of activity and activity coefficients for both the Raoult and Henry conventions as laid out in the problem statement and standard thermodynamic literature.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Option B:** For an ideal vapor phase and negligible Poynting correction, $K_B / p_B^\\ast = \\lim_{x_B \\to 0} \\gamma_B(x_B)$, the infinite-dilution limit of the Raoult-scale activity coefficient of $B$ in $A$. Therefore $K_B \\neq p_B^\\ast$ unless $\\gamma_B^\\infty = 1$, a condition that requires $B$ to behave Raoult-ideally in $A$ and that a pure liquid state of $B$ be meaningful under the same thermodynamic conditions.\nFrom our derivation, $K_B = \\gamma_B^\\infty p_B^\\ast(T)$. Rearranging gives $K_B / p_B^\\ast = \\gamma_B^\\infty$, which is precisely $\\lim_{x_B \\to 0} \\gamma_B(x_B)$. The first part is correct. Consequently, $K_B = p_B^\\ast$ if and only if $\\gamma_B^\\infty = 1$. The condition $\\gamma_B^\\infty = 1$ describes a situation where the solute $B$ behaves ideally even at infinite dilution in solvent $A$. For an ideal solution that follows Raoult's law across all compositions, $\\gamma_B = 1$ for all $x_B$, so $\\gamma_B^\\infty = 1$. The caveat that a pure liquid state of $B$ must be meaningful for $p_B^\\ast$ to be a well-defined physical property is also a necessary condition for the comparison.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Option C:** By construction, the Henry standard state is solvent independent; thus $K_B(T,P;A_1) = K_B(T,P;A_2)$ for any two solvents $A_1$ and $A_2$ at the same $T,P$.\nThis statement is fundamentally incorrect. The notation $K_B(T,P;A)$ explicitly indicates a dependence on the solvent $A$. Our derived relation $K_B = \\gamma_B^\\infty p_B^\\ast$ confirms this. While $p_B^\\ast$ is a property of the pure solute $B$, the infinite-dilution activity coefficient, $\\gamma_B^\\infty$, is a measure of the interaction between solute molecules ($B$) and solvent molecules ($A$) at infinite dilution. These interactions are specific to the solute-solvent pair. Changing the solvent from $A_1$ to $A_2$ will, in general, change the value of $\\gamma_B^\\infty$, and therefore change the value of $K_B$. For example, the Henry's constant of oxygen in water is different from that in perfluorodecalin.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option D:** When $B$ is sparingly soluble, the Raoult and Henry standard states become identical as $x_B \\to 0$, implying $K_B = p_B^\\ast$ generally in the infinite-dilution limit.\nThis statement contains multiple errors. First, standard states are fixed reference points and do not depend on the composition of the mixture, so they cannot \"become identical\" as $x_B \\to 0$. The Raoult standard state is pure liquid $B$, while the Henry standard state is a hypothetical state. They are distinct concepts. Second, the implication that $K_B = p_B^\\ast$ is false. This would require $\\gamma_B^\\infty = 1$. A solute being \"sparingly soluble\" is often a consequence of large positive deviations from Raoult's law, meaning the interactions between unlike molecules ($A-B$) are much less favorable than between like molecules ($A-A$ and $B-B$). This leads to a very large value for $\\gamma_B^\\infty$ ($\\gamma_B^\\infty \\gg 1$), and therefore $K_B \\gg p_B^\\ast$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option E:** The reference chemical potentials for the Raoult and Henry standard states of $B$ are identical, that is, $\\mu_B^{H\\circ}(T,P) = \\mu_B^\\ast(T,P)$; they do not depend on the choice of solvent because both are defined at the same $T,P$.\nThe chemical potential of a standard state $\\mu_i^\\ominus$ is related to its fugacity $f_i^\\ominus$ by $\\mu_i^\\ominus = \\mu_i^{v,\\circ} + RT \\ln(f_i^\\ominus/P^\\circ)$, where $\\mu_i^{v,\\circ}$ and $P^\\circ$ are fixed. Thus, equality of standard-state chemical potentials implies equality of standard-state fugacities. The statement $\\mu_B^{H\\circ}(T,P) = \\mu_B^\\ast(T,P)$ (using $\\mu_B^\\ast$ for the Raoult state) is equivalent to saying $f_B^{\\ominus,H} = f_B^{\\ominus,R}$, which means $K_B = p_B^\\ast$. As established in our analysis of option B, this is only true in the special case where $\\gamma_B^\\infty = 1$. In general, they are not equal. Furthermore, the Henry's law standard state chemical potential $\\mu_B^{H\\circ}$ depends on $K_B$, which is solvent-dependent. Therefore, $\\mu_B^{H\\circ}$ is solvent-dependent, contrary to the claim. The Raoult standard state chemical potential, $\\mu_B^\\ast(T,P)$, being that of the pure substance $B$, is indeed solvent-independent. The entire statement is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "2645384"}, {"introduction": "Many practical chemical systems involve mixtures of multiple components with different behaviors.

First, we must assess its validity. The problem provides a complete set of data: temperature $T$, liquid-phase mole fractions $x_i$ for three components, saturation pressures $P_i^{\\ast}$ for the two solvents, and the Henry's law constant $H_3$ for the dilute solute. The sum of the mole fractions is $x_{1} + x_{2} + x_{3} = 0.695 + 0.300 + 0.005 = 1.000$, which is consistent. The assumptions provided—ideal gas vapor phase, ideal solvent mixture (Lewis-Randall framework), ideal dilute solute (Henry's framework), and negligible Poynting correction—are standard and scientifically sound for such a calculation. The problem is well-posed, objective, and scientifically grounded. It does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity. Therefore, we proceed to the solution.\n\nThe fundamental condition for phase equilibrium for each component $i$ is the equality of fugacity in the vapor phase ($f_{i}^{(v)}$) and the liquid phase ($f_{i}^{(l)}$):\n$$f_{i}^{(v)} = f_{i}^{(l)}$$\nThe problem stipulates that the vapor phase behaves as an ideal gas mixture. For an ideal gas mixture, the fugacity of component $i$ is equal to its partial pressure, which is given by Dalton's law as $y_i P$, where $y_i$ is the mole fraction of component $i$ in the vapor phase and $P$ is the total system pressure.\n$$f_{i}^{(v)} = y_{i} P$$\nThe expression for the fugacity in the liquid phase, $f_{i}^{(l)}$, depends on the choice of standard state for each component.\n\nFor the solvents (species $1$ and $2$), the problem states the liquid solution is ideal with respect to the Lewis–Randall (L-R) standard state. The L-R standard state is the pure liquid component at the system temperature $T$ and pressure $P$. The fugacity in the liquid for component $i$ is given by $f_{i}^{(l)} = \\gamma_{i} x_{i} f_{i}^{\\circ}$, where $\\gamma_{i}$ is the activity coefficient, $x_{i}$ is the liquid mole fraction, and $f_{i}^{\\circ}$ is the standard-state fugacity. For an ideal solution in the L-R framework, the activity coefficient is unity, so $\\gamma_{i} = 1$ for $i=1, 2$. The standard-state fugacity $f_{i}^{\\circ}$ is the fugacity of pure liquid $i$ at $(T, P)$. This is related to the fugacity at saturation, $f_i^{\\text{sat}}$, by the Poynting correction factor: $f_{i}^{\\circ} = f_i^{\\text{sat}} \\exp\\left(\\frac{V_i^{(l)}(P - P_i^{\\ast})}{RT}\\right)$. The problem states we can neglect the Poynting correction, so the exponential term is approximately $1$. The fugacity at saturation, $f_i^{\\text{sat}} = \\phi_i^{\\text{sat}} P_i^{\\ast}$, where $\\phi_i^{\\text{sat}}$ is the fugacity coefficient of the saturated vapor. For moderate pressures, we can assume the pure vapor is an ideal gas, so $\\phi_i^{\\text{sat}} \\approx 1$. Thus, the standard-state fugacity simplifies to the saturation pressure, $f_{i}^{\\circ} \\approx P_{i}^{\\ast}$. This formulation leads to Raoult's law.

For the solute $B$ at infinite dilution, the standard state is taken according to the Henry standard state.\n- For the vapor phase treated as an ideal gas, use Dalton’s law and $f_i^{g} = y_i P$ for component $i$.\n- The temperature dependence of the pure-solvent saturation pressure is described by the integrated Clausius–Clapeyron equation (with temperature-independent enthalpy of vaporization).\n- The temperature dependence of the dissolution equilibrium constant for $B$ obeys the van’t Hoff equation (with temperature-independent enthalpy of solution), and recall that the pressure-based Henry constant is inversely proportional to the dissolution equilibrium constant by definition of standard states.\n\nUsing only these bases (do not assume any target relations a priori), derive expressions for:\n- The saturation pressure $P_A^{\\text{sat}}(T)$ of the pure solvent $A$ as a function of $T$ given a reference value and a constant enthalpy of vaporization.\n- The pressure-based Henry constant $K_B(T)$ of the solute $B$ as a function of $T$ given a reference value and a constant enthalpy of solution, taking care with the sign implied by the inversion between the equilibrium constant and the Henry constant.\n- The component partial pressures $p_A$ and $p_B$ at the bubble point of a liquid mixture of overall composition $\\{x_A, x_B\\}$, and the total pressure $P = p_A + p_B$.\n- The vapor-phase mole fraction of the solute, $y_B = p_B / P$.\n\nData, units, and constants to use:\n- Universal gas constant: $R = 8.314462618\\ \\text{J}\\ \\text{mol}^{-1}\\ \\text{K}^{-1}$.\n- Reference temperature: $T_0 = 298.15\\ \\text{K}$.\n- Solvent $A$ (temperature dependence of pure-component vapor pressure by Clausius–Clapeyron):\n  - Reference saturation pressure: $P_A^{\\text{sat}}(T_0) = 31.3\\ \\text{kPa}$.\n  - Enthalpy of vaporization (assumed temperature-independent): $\\Delta H_{\\text{vap},A} = 30.8\\times 10^{3}\\ \\text{J}\\ \\text{mol}^{-1}$.\n- Solute $B$ (temperature dependence of pressure-based Henry constant via van’t Hoff applied consistently to the dissolution equilibrium with the inverse relation to the pressure-based Henry constant):\n  - Reference Henry constant: $K_B(T_0) = 500.0\\ \\text{kPa}$.\n  - Enthalpy of solution (assumed temperature-independent): $\\Delta H_{\\text{sol},B} = -12.0\\times 10^{3}\\ \\text{J}\\ \\text{mol}^{-1}$.\n\nTest suite (each test case is specified by a temperature $T$ in $\\text{K}$ and a liquid-phase solute mole fraction $x_B$):\n- Case A: $T = 290.0$, $x_B = 0.01$.\n- Case B: $T = 298.15$, $x_B = 0.01$.\n- Case C: $T = 320.0$, $x_B = 0.01$.\n- Case D: $T = 350.0$, $x_B = 0.01$.\n- Case E (edge, extreme dilution): $T = 298.15$, $x_B = 1.0\\times 10^{-6}$.\n- Case F (edge, less dilute limit within ideal-dilute modeling): $T = 298.15$, $x_B = 0.10$.\n\nFor each case, compute:\n- The bubble-point total pressure $P$ in $\\text{kPa}$.\n- The vapor-phase mole fraction of the solute $y_B$ as a decimal.\n\nAdditionally, for trend analysis over the temperature range at fixed $x_B = 0.01$ (Cases A–D), compute two Boolean indicators:\n- $b_1$: whether the total pressure sequence $\\{P_A, P_B, P_C, P_D\\}$ is strictly increasing with $T$.\n- $b_2$: whether the solute vapor composition sequence $\\{y_{B,A}, y_{B,B}, y_{B,C}, y_{B,D}\\}$ is strictly decreasing with $T$.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets.\n- The list must contain, in order: for Cases A through F, a two-element list $[P,\\ y_B]$ for each case; followed by the two Booleans $b_1$ and $b_2$.\n- Units: Express $P$ in $\\text{kPa}$, and $y_B$ as a decimal (dimensionless). Booleans must be literal logicals.\n\nThus, the final printed line must have the form\n$[ [P_A,y_{B,A}], [P_B,y_{B,B}], [P_C,y_{B,C}], [P_D,y_{B,D}], [P_E,y_{B,E}], [P_F,y_{B,F}], b_1, b_2 ]$\nwith all $P$ in $\\text{kPa}$ and all $y_B$ as decimals. No additional text must be printed.", "solution": "The problem statement is evaluated and found to be valid. It is scientifically grounded in the principles of chemical thermodynamics, specifically the theory of vapor-liquid equilibrium for ideal and ideal-dilute solutions. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. The provided data are physically plausible. We may therefore proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe fundamental condition for vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) for any component $i$ is the equality of its chemical potential $\\mu_i$ in the liquid phase ($l$) and the vapor phase ($g$):\n$$ \\mu_i^l(T, P, x_i) = \\mu_i^g(T, P, y_i) $$\nwhere $T$ is the temperature, $P$ is the total pressure, and $x_i$ and $y_i$ are the mole fractions in the liquid and vapor phases, respectively.\n\nThis equality of chemical potentials implies the equality of fugacities, $f_i$:\n$$ f_i^l(T, P, x_i) = f_i^g(T, P, y_i) $$\n\nFor the vapor phase, which is treated as an ideal gas mixture, the fugacity of component $i$ is equal to its partial pressure $p_i$. According to Dalton's law, $p_i = y_i P$. Therefore:\n$$ f_i^g = y_i P $$\nCombining these gives the central relation $f_i^l = y_i P$. We must now establish the expressions for the liquid-phase fugacities.\n\nFor the solvent, component $A$, the solution is ideal. The standard state is the pure liquid solvent at the system temperature $T$. The activity $a_A$ is thus equal to its mole fraction $x_A$. The fugacity is given by:\n$$ f_A^l = a_A f_A^{\\circ, l} = x_A f_{\\text{pure A}}^l(T, P) $$\nThe fugacity of the pure liquid, $f_{\\text{pure A}}^l(T, P)$, is well approximated by its saturation pressure, $P_A^{\\text{sat}}(T)$, neglecting the small effect of total pressure (the Poynting correction), which is appropriate for pressures that are not excessively high. This leads to Raoult's law:\n$$ p_A = y_A P = x_A P_A^{\\text{sat}}(T) $$\n\nFor the solute, component $B$, the solution is an ideal dilute solution. The standard state is the hypothetical state of pure solute with properties extrapolated from infinite dilution, consistent with Henry's law. In this convention, the activity $a_B$ is taken to be equal to the mole fraction $x_B$ in the dilute regime. The fugacity is:\n$$ f_B^l = a_B f_B^{\\circ, l} = x_B K_B(T) $$\nwhere the standard state fugacity is the Henry's law constant, $K_B(T)$. This leads to Henry's law:\n$$ p_B = y_B P = x_B K_B(T) $$\n\nNext, we establish the temperature dependence of $P_A^{\\text{sat}}(T)$ and $K_B(T)$.\n\nThe temperature dependence of the solvent's saturation pressure, $P_A^{\\text{sat}}(T)$, is given by the integrated Clausius-Clapeyron equation. Assuming the enthalpy of vaporization, $\\Delta H_{\\text{vap},A}$, is constant over the temperature range:\n$$ \\frac{d \\ln P_A^{\\text{sat}}}{dT} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{vap},A}}{RT^2} $$\nIntegrating from a reference state $(T_0, P_A^{\\text{sat}}(T_0))$ to a state $(T, P_A^{\\text{sat}}(T))$ yields:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_A^{\\text{sat}}(T)}{P_A^{\\text{sat}}(T_0)}\\right) = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{vap},A}}{R} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_0} - \\frac{1}{T}\\right) $$\nThe working equation for the saturation pressure of solvent $A$ is:\n$$ P_A^{\\text{sat}}(T) = P_A^{\\text{sat}}(T_0) \\exp\\left[ \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{vap},A}}{R} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_0} - \\frac{1}{T}\\right) \\right] $$\n\nThe temperature dependence of the Henry's constant, $K_B(T)$, is derived from the van't Hoff equation applied to the dissolution equilibrium $B(g) \\rightleftharpoons B(l)$. The equilibrium constant for this process, $k_{eq}$, is inversely proportional to $K_B$, i.e., $k_{eq} \\propto 1/K_B$. The van't Hoff equation is:\n$$ \\frac{d \\ln k_{eq}}{dT} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{sol},B}}{RT^2} $$\nwhere $\\Delta H_{\\text{sol},B}$ is the enthalpy of solution. Since $\\ln k_{eq} = \\text{const} - \\ln K_B$, its derivative with respect to temperature is $d \\ln k_{eq}/dT = -d \\ln K_B/dT$. Substituting this into the van't Hoff equation gives:\n$$ \\frac{d \\ln K_B}{dT} = -\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{sol},B}}{RT^2} $$\nIntegration with a constant enthalpy of solution, $\\Delta H_{\\text{sol},B}$, from $(T_0, K_B(T_0))$ to $(T, K_B(T))$ gives:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{K_B(T)}{K_B(T_0)}\\right) = -\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{sol},B}}{R} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_0} - \\frac{1}{T}\\right) $$\nThe working equation for the Henry's constant of solute $B$ is:\n$$ K_B(T) = K_B(T_0) \\exp\\left[ -\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{sol},B}}{R} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_0} - \\frac{1}{T}\\right) \\right] $$\n\nAt the bubble point of the binary mixture, the total pressure $P$ is the sum of the partial pressures. For a liquid of composition $\\{x_A, x_B\\}$, where $x_A = 1 - x_B$:\n$$ P = p_A + p_B = x_A P_A^{\\text{sat}}(T) + x_B K_B(T) $$\nSubstituting $x_A=1-x_B$, we obtain the total bubble-point pressure as a function of temperature and liquid composition:\n$$ P(T, x_B) = (1-x_B)P_A^{\\text{sat}}(T) + x_B K_B(T) $$\n\nThe mole fraction of the solute $B$ in the vapor phase, $y_B$, is the ratio of its partial pressure to the total pressure:\n$$ y_B = \\frac{p_B}{P} = \\frac{x_B K_B(T)}{(1-x_B)P_A^{\\text{sat}}(T) + x_B K_B(T)} $$\n\nThese derived relations provide a complete model to calculate the bubble-point pressure and vapor composition for the given test suite. The program implements these equations using the provided physical constants and parameters. Specifically, functions are defined to calculate $P_A^{\\text{sat}}(T)$ and $K_B(T)$. These are then used to compute $P$ and $y_B$ for each test case specified by a temperature $T$ and a liquid-phase solute mole fraction $x_B$.\nThe test cases are:\nCase A: $T = 290.0\\ \\text{K}$, $x_B = 0.01$.\nCase B: $T = 298.15\\ \\text{K}$, $x_B = 0.01$.\nCase C: $T = 320.0\\ \\text{K}$, $x_B = 0.01$.\nCase D: $T = 350.0\\ \\text{K}$, $x_B = 0.01$.\nCase E: $T = 298.15\\ \\text{K}$, $x_B = 1.0 \\times 10^{-6}$.\nCase F: $T = 298.15\\ \\text{K}$, $x_B = 0.10$.\n\nThe results from cases A through D are then analyzed to determine the trend of total pressure $P$ with temperature, which defines the boolean indicator $b_1$, and the trend of solute vapor mole fraction $y_B$ with temperature, which defines the boolean indicator $b_2$. The final output is formatted as a single-line string representation of a list containing the computed pairs $[P, y_B]$ and the booleans $[b_1, b_2]$, as per the problem specification.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives and computes bubble-point properties for a binary ideal/ideal-dilute solution.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define physical constants and reference data from the problem statement.\n    R = 8.314462618  # Universal gas constant in J mol^-1 K^-1\n    T0 = 298.15  # Reference temperature in K\n\n    # Solvent A properties\n    P_A_sat_T0 = 31.3  # Reference saturation pressure in kPa\n    DELTA_H_vap_A = 30.8e3  # Enthalpy of vaporization in J mol^-1\n\n    # Solute B properties\n    K_B_T0 = 500.0  # Reference Henry's constant in kPa\n    DELTA_H_sol_B = -12.0e3  # Enthalpy of solution in J mol^-1\n\n    def get_P_A_sat(T: float) -> float:\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the saturation pressure of solvent A at temperature T using the\n        integrated Clausius-Clapeyron equation.\n        \"\"\"\n        if T == T0:\n            return P_A_sat_T0\n        exponent = (DELTA_H_vap_A / R) * (1.0/T0 - 1.0/T)\n        return P_A_sat_T0 * np.exp(exponent)\n\n    def get_K_B(T: float) -> float:\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the Henry's constant of solute B at temperature T using the\n        integrated form of the van't Hoff relation.\n        \"\"\"\n        if T == T0:\n            return K_B_T0\n        # The derivation yields a negative sign on the enthalpy of solution\n        exponent = (-DELTA_H_sol_B / R) * (1.0/T0 - 1.0/T)\n        return K_B_T0 * np.exp(exponent)\n\n    def calculate_bubble_point(T: float, x_B: float) -> list[float]:\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the bubble-point total pressure P and vapor-phase mole fraction y_B\n        for a given temperature T and liquid-phase mole fraction x_B.\n        \"\"\"\n        P_A_sat_val = get_P_A_sat(T)\n        K_B_val = get_K_B(T)\n        \n        x_A = 1.0 - x_B\n        \n        # Calculate partial pressures based on Raoult's and Henry's laws\n        p_A = x_A * P_A_sat_val\n        p_B = x_B * K_B_val\n        \n        # Total bubble-point pressure is the sum of partial pressures\n        P_total = p_A + p_B\n        \n        # Vapor-phase mole fraction of solute B\n        y_B = p_B / P_total if P_total > 0 else 0.0\n        \n        return [P_total, y_B]\n\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    test_cases = [\n        (290.0, 0.01),      # Case A\n        (298.15, 0.01),     # Case B\n        (320.0, 0.01),      # Case C\n        (350.0, 0.01),      # Case D\n        (298.15, 1.0e-6),   # Case E\n        (298.15, 0.10)      # Case F\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for T, x_B in test_cases:\n        result = calculate_bubble_point(T, x_B)\n        results.append(result)\n\n    # Perform trend analysis for Cases A-D.\n    # Extract pressures and y_B values for the first four cases.\n    pressures_A_to_D = [res[0] for res in results[0:4]]\n    yB_A_to_D = [res[1] for res in results[0:4]]\n\n    # b1: Check if the total pressure sequence is strictly increasing with temperature.\n    b1 = all(pressures_A_to_D[i] < pressures_A_to_D[i+1] for i in range(len(pressures_A_to_D)-1))\n    \n    # b2: Check if the solute vapor composition sequence is strictly decreasing with temperature.\n    b2 = all(yB_A_to_D[i] > yB_A_to_D[i+1] for i in range(len(yB_A_to_D)-1))\n\n    # Assemble the final list for output.\n    final_list = results + [b1, b2]\n\n    # Format the list into the specified string format.\n    output_parts = []\n    for item in final_list:\n        if isinstance(item, list):\n            # Format [P, y_B] pair without extra spaces\n            output_parts.append(f\"[{item[0]},{item[1]}]\")\n        elif isinstance(item, bool):\n            # Format boolean as a literal \"True\" or \"False\"\n            output_parts.append(str(item))\n\n    final_output_string = f\"[{','.join(output_parts)}]\"\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(final_output_string)\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2645398"}]}
