We must proceed from first principles of the canonical ensemble. The fundamental principle is that the probability of finding a system in a specific energy level $J$, denoted here as $p_J$, is proportional to the product of the level's degeneracy $g_J$ and the Boltzmann factor $e^{-E_J/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)}$.\n$$ p_J = \\frac{g_J e^{-E_J/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)}}{Q} $$\nwhere $E_J = B J(J+1)$ is the energy of level $J$, $g_J$ is its degeneracy, $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $Q$ is the canonical partition function, $Q = \\sum_J g_J e^{-E_J/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)}$. Since we are looking for the *most populated* level, we seek the value of $J$ that maximizes $p_J$. The denominator $Q$ is a constant for a fixed temperature $T$, so we only need to find the maximum of the numerator, $N_J \\propto g_J e^{-E_J/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)}$.\n\nFirst, we analyze Model I, where the degeneracy $g_J = 1$ for all non-negative integers $J$.\nThe population of level $J$ is proportional to:\n$$ p_J \\propto 1 \\cdot e^{-B J(J+1)/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)} $$\nThe energy $E_J = B J(J+1)$ is a strictly increasing function for $J \\ge 0$, since $B>0$. The exponential function $e^{-x}$ is a strictly decreasing function of its argument $x$. Therefore, the population $p_J$ is a strictly decreasing function of $J$ for any finite temperature $T > 0$. The maximum population must occur at the lowest possible value of the quantum number $J$, which is $J=0$.\n\nNext, we analyze Model II, where the degeneracy is $g_J = 2J+1$ for all non-negative integers $J$.\nThe population of level $J$ is proportional to:\n$$ p_J \\propto (2J+1) e^{-B J(J+1)/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)} $$\nThis function is a product of two competing terms: the degeneracy $(2J+1)$, which increases linearly with $J$, and the Boltzmann factor $e^{-B J(J+1)/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)}$, which decreases exponentially with $J(J+1)$. For $J>0$, it is not immediately obvious which level is most populated. To find the maximum, we can treat $J$ as a continuous variable and find the extremum by taking the derivative with respect to $J$ and setting it to zero. Let $f(J) = (2J+1) e^{-B J(J+1)/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)}$.\n$$ \\frac{df}{dJ} = \\frac{d}{dJ} \\left[ (2J+1) e^{-B(J^2+J)/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)} \\right] $$\n$$ \\frac{df}{dJ} = 2 \\cdot e^{-B(J^2+J)/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)} + (2J+1) \\cdot e^{-B(J^2+J)/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)} \\cdot \\left( -\\frac{B(2J+1)}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T} \\right) $$\nSetting the derivative to zero to find the maximum, which we label $J^*$:\n$$ e^{-B(J^{*2}+J^*)/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)} \\left[ 2 - \\frac{B(2J^*+1)^2}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T} \\right] = 0 $$\nSince the exponential term is never zero for finite $J^*$, we must have:\n$$ 2 - \\frac{B(2J^*+1)^2}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T} = 0 $$\n$$ (2J^*+1)^2 = \\frac{2k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{B} $$\nTaking the positive square root, since $2J+1>0$ for $J \\ge 0$:\n$$ 2J^*+1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{B}} $$\n$$ J^* = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{B}} - 1\\right) $$\nThe actual most populated integer level will be the integer closest to this value of $J^*$. This treatment is a very good approximation, especially for large $J^*$.\n\nNow we evaluate each statement.\n\nA. In Model I with $g_J=1$, at any finite $T$, the most populated level is $J=0$.\nAs demonstrated in our analysis of Model I, the population $p_J \\propto e^{-B J(J+1)/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)}$ is a monotonically decreasing function for $J \\ge 0$. Its maximum value is at $J=0$. This statement is **Correct**.\n\nB. In Model II with $g_J=2J+1$, the most populated level $J^*$ satisfies approximately $(2J^*+1)^2 \\approx 2\\,k_{\\mathrm{B}}T/B$, i.e., $J^* \\approx \\tfrac{1}{2}\\!\\left(\\sqrt{2\\,k_{\\mathrm{B}}T/B}-1\\right)$, and therefore shifts to higher $J$ as $T$ increases.\nOur derivation for Model II yielded exactly this result for the continuous approximation of the most populated level $J^*$. The expression for $J^*$ is an increasing function of temperature $T$. Thus, as $T$ increases, the most populated level shifts to higher $J$ values. This statement is **Correct**.\n\nC. In Model II with $g_J=2J+1$, in the limit $k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\ll B$, the most populated level remains $J=0$.\nIn the low temperature limit, $T \\to 0$, we examine the expression for $J^*$:\n$$ \\lim_{T \\to 0} J^* = \\lim_{T \\to 0} \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{B}} - 1\\right) = -\\frac{1}{2} $$\nSince $J^*$ approaches a negative value, and the physical quantum number $J$ must be a non-negative integer, the maximum of the discrete function must be at the lowest possible value, $J=0$.\nAlternatively, we can examine the ratio of populations of successive levels, $p_{J+1}/p_J$:\n$$ \\frac{p_1}{p_0} = \\frac{g_1 e^{-E_1/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)}}{g_0 e^{-E_0/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)}} = \\frac{(2(1)+1) e^{-B(1)(2)/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)}}{(2(0)+1) e^{-B(0)(1)/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)}} = 3 e^{-2B/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)} $$\nIn the limit $k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\ll B$, the exponent $-2B/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)$ is a large negative number, so $e^{-2B/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)} \\to 0$. Thus, $p_1/p_0 \\ll 1$, meaning the population of level $J=1$ is much smaller than that of $J=0$. A similar analysis shows populations decrease rapidly for $J>0$. The most populated level is indeed $J=0$. This statement is **Correct**.\n\nD. Introducing rotational degeneracy $g_J=2J+1$ does not change which level is most populated at any $T$; it only rescales all populations by the same constant factor.\nThis is incorrect. In Model I, the most populated level is always $J=0$. In Model II, for any temperature $T > 0$, the most populated level $J^*$ is given by $J^* \\approx \\frac{1}{2} (\\sqrt{2k_{\\mathrm{B}}T/B} - 1)$. For sufficiently high temperature, e.g., when $2k_{\\mathrm{B}}T/B > 9$, we have $J^* > 1$, meaning a level other than $J=0$ is most populated. Furthermore, the factor $g_J=2J+1$ is not a constant; it depends on $J$, so it does not simply rescale all populations uniformly. This statement is **Incorrect**.\n\nE. In Model II with $g_J=2J+1$, the ratio of successive level populations $p_{J+1}/p_J$ is independent of $J$ at fixed $T$.\nLet us calculate this ratio:\n$$ \\frac{p_{J+1}}{p_J} = \\frac{g_{J+1} e^{-E_{J+1}/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)}}{g_J e^{-E_J/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)}} = \\frac{g_{J+1}}{g_J} e^{-(E_{J+1}-E_J)/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)} $$\nUsing $g_J=2J+1$ and $E_J=B J(J+1)$, we find $E_{J+1}-E_J = B(J+1)(J+2) - B J(J+1) = 2B(J+1)$.\nThe ratio becomes:\n$$ \\frac{p_{J+1}}{p_J} = \\frac{2J+3}{2J+1} e^{-2B(J+1)/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)} $$\nThis expression clearly depends on the quantum number $J$. Thus, the ratio is not independent of $J$. This statement is **Incorrect**.\n\nF. In Model II with $g_J=2J+1$, as $T\\to\\infty$, the most populated $J$ grows without bound and scales as $J^*\\propto \\sqrt{T}$.\nWe examine the high temperature limit of our expression for $J^*$:\n$$ J^* = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\sqrt{\\frac{2k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{B}} - 1\\right) $$\nAs $T \\to \\infty$, the term $\\sqrt{2k_{\\mathrm{B}}T/B}$ becomes much larger than $1$.

Assuming for simplicity that the degeneracies are $g_1=g_2=1$, the populations are $p_1 = \\rho_{11}$ and $p_2 = \\rho_{22}$.\nIn this case, the steady-state population of level $2$ is:\n$$ p_2 = \\rho_{22} = \\frac{\\Omega^2}{\\gamma^2 + 2\\Omega^2} $$\nThe population of level $1$ is $p_1 = 1 - p_2 = \\frac{\\gamma^2 + \\Omega^2}{\\gamma^2 + 2\\Omega^2}$.\nFor population inversion, we require $p_2  p_1$.\n$$ \\frac{\\Omega^2}{\\gamma^2 + 2\\Omega^2}  \\frac{\\gamma^2 + \\Omega^2}{\\gamma^2 + 2\\Omega^2} \\implies \\Omega^2  \\gamma^2 + \\Omega^2 \\implies 0  \\gamma^2 $$\nThis is impossible since the spontaneous emission rate $\\gamma$ is a positive quantity. The maximum population of the upper state is achieved in the limit of very strong driving ($\\Omega \\gg \\gamma$), where $p_2 \\to \\frac{\\Omega^2}{2\\Omega^2} = 1/2$. The populations equalize but never invert. Even if we strictly adhere to the problem's premise of using rate equations, with a coherent drive causing stimulated absorption and emission at an equal rate $W$, the rate equations are $\\dot{p}_2 = W p_1 - W p_2 - \\gamma p_2$ and $\\dot{p}_1 = -W p_1 + W p_2 + \\gamma p_2$. In steady state, $W p_1 = (W+\\gamma)p_2$, giving $p_2/p_1 = W/(W+\\gamma)  1$. No inversion is possible.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nB. A $3$-level system is continuously pumped from level $1$ to level $3$ at rate $W_p$. Rapid nonradiative relaxation brings population from level $3$ to level $2$ at a rate $k_{32}$ satisfying $k_{32} \\gg W_p, A_{21}$, where $A_{21}$ is the spontaneous emission rate for $2 \\to 1$.\n\nThis describes a classic three-level laser pumping scheme. Let us write the rate equations for the populations $p_1, p_2, p_3$ in the steady state ($\\dot{p}_i=0$), assuming for simplicity $g_1=g_2=g_3=1$:\n$$ \\dot{p}_3 = W_p p_1 - k_{32} p_3 = 0 \\implies p_3 = \\frac{W_p}{k_{32}} p_1 $$\n$$ \\dot{p}_2 = k_{32} p_3 - A_{21} p_2 = 0 \\implies k_{32} p_3 = A_{21} p_2 $$\nWe have ignored other weak processes as per the problem description. Substituting the expression for $p_3$ into the second equation:\n$$ k_{32} \\left(\\frac{W_p}{k_{32}} p_1\\right) = A_{21} p_2 \\implies W_p p_1 = A_{21} p_2 $$\nThis yields the population ratio:\n$$ \\frac{p_2}{p_1} = \\frac{W_p}{A_{21}} $$\nFor population inversion ($p_2/p_1 > 1$), we need the pumping rate to be greater than the decay rate of the upper lasing level, $W_p > A_{21}$. This is a standard condition for laser operation and is achievable by using a sufficiently strong pump. The condition $k_{32} \\gg A_{21}$ ensures that population arriving in level $3$ is efficiently transferred to level $2$ rather than decaying back to level $1$, which is crucial for the mechanism to work well. In the presence of degeneracies, the condition becomes $p_2/g_2 > p_1/g_1$, which requires $W_p/A_{21} > g_2/g_1$, which is also achievable. This mechanism drives a net population flow through the cycle $1 \\to 3 \\to 2 \\to 1$, which is a direct violation of detailed balance.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nC. A $2$-level system formed by levels $1$ and $2$ is coupled only to a single blackbody radiation field at temperature $T$ and the buffer gas at the same temperature $T$.\n\nThe system is coupled to reservoirs that are all at the same temperature $T$. According to the zeroth law of thermodynamics, the system will equilibrate with these reservoirs and reach the same temperature $T$. As demonstrated in the introductory analysis, a system in thermal equilibrium at temperature $T$ has its populations governed by the Boltzmann distribution, which forbids population inversion between levels with $E_2 > E_1$. This system obeys detailed balance by construction.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nD. A $2$-level system formed by levels $1$ and $2$ is coupled to two distinct thermal radiation reservoirs: absorption $1 \\to 2$ couples to a hot source at temperature $T_h$, while emission $2 \\to 1$ couples predominantly to a cold sink at temperature $T_c$, with $T_h > T_c$.\n\nThis arrangement describes a non-equilibrium system driven by a temperature difference. We can model the rates as follows. The upward transition rate is driven by the hot reservoir: $R_{1 \\to 2} = W_{12} p_1$, where $W_{12}$ is proportional to the photon number density at $T_h$, i.e., $W_{12} = C n(\\omega_{21}, T_h)$, where $n(\\omega, T) = (e^{\\hbar\\omega/k_{\\mathrm{B}} T} - 1)^{-1}$. The downward rate involves both spontaneous emission (rate $A_{21}$) and stimulated emission, which is driven by the cold reservoir: $R_{2 \\to 1} = (A_{21} + W_{21}) p_2$, where $W_{21} = C' n(\\omega_{21}, T_c)$. Using Einstein relations $g_1 C = g_2 C'$, we can set up the steady-state equation $R_{1 \\to 2} = R_{2 \\to 1}$.\n$$ (g_2 C p_1) n(\\omega_{21}, T_h) = (g_1 A_{21} + g_1 C n(\\omega_{21}, T_c)) p_2 $$\nThe population ratio per state is:\n$$ \\frac{p_2/g_2}{p_1/g_1} = \\frac{C n(\\omega_{21}, T_h)}{A_{21} + C n(\\omega_{21}, T_c)} $$\nPopulation inversion ($p_2/g_2 > p_1/g_1$) is achieved if $C n(\\omega_{21}, T_h) > A_{21} + C n(\\omega_{21}, T_c)$, or $n(\\omega_{21}, T_h) > A_{21}/C + n(\\omega_{21}, T_c)$. Since $T_h > T_c$, we have $n(\\omega_{21}, T_h) > n(\\omega_{21}, T_c)$. Therefore, if the coupling $C$ is sufficiently strong relative to the spontaneous emission rate $A_{21}$, this condition can be met. This establishes a non-equilibrium steady state with a net flow of energy from the hot to the cold reservoir, necessarily violating detailed balance.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nE. A $3$-level $\\Lambda$-system with lower states $1$ and $2$ and an excited state $3$ is driven by two phase-coherent lasers implementing a Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP) sequence.\n\nSTIRAP is a coherent quantum control technique that allows for the transfer of population from an initial state $|1\\rangle$ to a final state $|2\\rangle$ via an intermediate state $|3\\rangle$, without significantly populating state $|3\\rangle$. This is achieved by applying a \"counterintuitive\" pulse sequence: the Stokes laser (coupling $|2\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |3\\rangle$) is applied before the pump laser (coupling $|1\\rangle \\leftrightarrow |3\\rangle$). If the process is adiabatic, the system's state vector evolves along a \"dark state\" superposition which changes from being purely state $|1\\rangle$ at the beginning to purely state $|2\\rangle$ at the end. An ideal STIRAP process can achieve nearly $100\\%$ transfer efficiency. If the system starts with its entire population in level $1$ ($p_1=1, p_2=0, p_3=0$), after the STIRAP sequence it will be in the state $p_1=0, p_2=1, p_3=0$. This constitutes a complete population inversion between levels $1$ and $2$. As STIRAP is a process driven by external coherent fields, it is fundamentally non-equilibrium and does not obey detailed balance.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nIn summary, mechanisms B, D, and E are all capable of producing a population inversion and, as a necessary consequence, all operate in a non-equilibrium regime that violates the principle of detailed balance for a single temperature.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BDE}$$", "id": "2671128"}]}
