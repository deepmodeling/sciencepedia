Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts: first, the calculation of the classical RRK probability; second, the calculation of the quantum RRKM statistical factor; and third, the computation of their ratio.\n\nPart 1: Calculation of $P_{\\mathrm{RRK}}(E)$\n\nThe RRK theory, in its classical formulation, assumes that the total energy $E$ is distributed continuously among $s$ identical harmonic oscillators. The accessible phase space is an $(s-1)$-dimensional simplex defined by $\\sum_{i=1}^{s} E_i = E$ with $E_i \\ge 0$, where $E_i$ is the energy in the $i$-th oscillator. The volume (or more precisely, hyper-area) of this simplex is proportional to $E^{s-1}$.\n\nThe probability $P_{\\mathrm{RRK}}(E)$ that a specific oscillator (the reactive mode) has an energy of at least $E_0$ is the ratio of the volume of the favorable region of phase space to the total volume of phase space. The favorable region is where the reactive mode energy $E_r \\ge E_0$. This condition can be rewritten by defining a new variable $E'_r = E_r - E_0 \\ge 0$. The energy conservation equation becomes $(E'_r + E_0) + \\sum_{i=2}^{s} E_i = E$, which simplifies to $E'_r + \\sum_{i=2}^{s} E_i = E - E_0$. This describes a smaller simplex of total energy $E-E_0$. The volume of this smaller simplex is proportional to $(E - E_0)^{s-1}$.\n\nThe probability is the ratio of these volumes:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{RRK}}(E) = \\frac{(\\text{Volume for total energy } E-E_0)}{(\\text{Volume for total energy } E)} = \\left(\\frac{E - E_0}{E}\\right)^{s-1}\n$$\nThe problem specifies energy in terms of quanta: $E = q\\varepsilon$ and $E_0 = q_0\\varepsilon$. Substituting these into the formula:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{RRK}}(E) = \\left(\\frac{q\\varepsilon - q_0\\varepsilon}{q\\varepsilon}\\right)^{s-1} = \\left(\\frac{q - q_0}{q}\\right)^{s-1}\n$$\nUsing the given values $s=4$, $q=12$, and $q_0=4$:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{RRK}}(E) = \\left(\\frac{12 - 4}{12}\\right)^{4-1} = \\left(\\frac{8}{12}\\right)^{3} = \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^{3} = \\frac{8}{27}\n$$\n\nPart 2: Calculation of $P_{\\mathrm{RRKM}}(E)$\n\nThe RRKM theory uses a quantum mechanical approach, counting discrete vibrational states. The statistical factor is $P_{\\mathrm{RRKM}}(E) = \\frac{N^{\\ddagger}(E - E_{0})}{g(E)}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate $g(E)$, the total number of microstates for the reactant. This corresponds to the number of ways to distribute $q$ identical quanta of energy among $s$ distinguishable oscillators. This is a classic combinatorial problem, the solution of which is given by the multiset coefficient:\n$$\ng(E) = \\binom{q + s - 1}{s - 1}\n$$\nWith $q=12$ and $s=4$:\n$$\ng(E) = \\binom{12 + 4 - 1}{4 - 1} = \\binom{15}{3} = \\frac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 5 \\times 7 \\times 13 = 455\n$$\n\nNext, we calculate $N^{\\ddagger}(E - E_0)$, the sum of states for the activated complex. According to the problem definition, this is the total number of quantum states with up to $q-q_0$ quanta distributed among the $s-1$ nonreactive (bath) modes.\nThis is the sum of the number of ways to distribute $k$ quanta in $s-1$ modes, for $k$ ranging from $0$ to $q-q_0$.\nThe number of ways to distribute $k$ quanta in $s-1$ modes is $\\binom{k + (s-1) - 1}{(s-1)-1} = \\binom{k + s - 2}{s-2}$.\nSo, $N^{\\ddagger}(E - E_0)$ is the sum:\n$$\nN^{\\ddagger}(E - E_0) = \\sum_{k=0}^{q-q_0} \\binom{k + s - 2}{s - 2}\n$$\nUsing the hockey-stick identity, $\\sum_{i=r}^{n} \\binom{i}{r} = \\binom{n+1}{r+1}$, we can evaluate this sum. The result of the sum is:\n$$\nN^{\\ddagger}(E - E_0) = \\binom{(q-q_0) + (s-1)}{s-1} = \\binom{q - q_0 + s - 1}{s-1}\n$$\nWith $q=12$, $q_0=4$, and $s=4$:\nThe number of available quanta is $q-q_0 = 12-4=8$. The number of bath modes is $s-1=3$.\n$$\nN^{\\ddagger}(E - E_0) = \\binom{8 + 4 - 1}{4 - 1} = \\binom{11}{3} = \\frac{11 \\times 10 \\times 9}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 11 \\times 5 \\times 3 = 165\n$$\nNow, we can compute the RRKM statistical factor:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{RRKM}}(E) = \\frac{N^{\\ddagger}(E - E_{0})}{g(E)} = \\frac{165}{455}\n$$\nThis fraction can be simplified by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is $5$:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{RRKM}}(E) = \\frac{165 \\div 5}{455 \\div 5} = \\frac{33}{91}\n$$\n\nPart 3: Calculation of the Ratio $R$\n\nThe final step is to compute the ratio $R = \\frac{P_{\\mathrm{RRKM}}(E)}{P_{\\mathrm{RRK}}(E)}$.\n$$\nR = \\frac{33/91}{8/27} = \\frac{33}{91} \\times \\frac{27}{8} = \\frac{33 \\times 27}{91 \\times 8}\n$$\nThe numerator is $33 \\times 27 = 891$.\nThe denominator is $91 \\times 8 = 728$.\nThus, the ratio is:\n$$\nR = \\frac{891}{728}\n$$\nThe prime factorization of the numerator is $891 = 3^4 \\times 11$. The prime factorization of the denominator is $728 = 2^3 \\times 7 \\times 13$.

The function value jumps whenever $(E-E_0)/(h\\nu^{\\ddagger})$ crosses an integer value, which happens at energy intervals of $h\\nu^{\\ddagger}$. At each jump, the floor function increases by $1$, so $k(E)$ increases by $1/(h\\rho_0)$. This is a correct description.\n-   For the low-temperature limit, $k_{\\mathrm{B}}T \\ll h\\nu^{\\ddagger}$, we have $x = h\\nu^{\\ddagger}/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T) \\gg 1$. In this case, $e^{-x} \\to 0$.

The interpretation is that at low temperatures, only the lowest-energy reaction channel (corresponding to the ground vibrational state of the TS) is accessible, leading to simple Arrhenius behavior with no entropic contribution from the TS vibration (as its partition function is effectively $1$). The statement is entirely correct.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Because of Boltzmann averaging, the staircase in $k(E)$ necessarily imprints oscillatory, non-monotonic features in $k(T)$ as a function of $T$ at low $T$, producing visible kinks whenever $k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$ equals an integer multiple of $h\\nu^{\\ddagger}$.**\n\n-   The process of thermal averaging involves convolution with the smooth Boltzmann distribution $e^{-E/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)}$. Convolution is a smoothing operation. The staircase in $k(E)$ will not produce kinks or non-monotonic behavior in $k(T)$. Our derived expression for $k(T)$ is a smooth, analytic function of $T$ for $T0$. Let us check its derivative with respect to $T$. Let $y = 1/T$. Then $dk/dT = (dk/dy)(dy/dT) = (dk/dy)(-1/T^2)$.\n$$\nk(y) = \\frac{e^{-E_0 y/k_B}}{h \\rho_0 (1-e^{-h\\nu^{\\ddagger}y/k_B})}\n$$\nBoth the numerator and denominator are monotonically decreasing functions of $y$ (increasing functions of $T$).

With multiple ($s$) TS modes, the TS rovibrational states become much denser.

Canonical measurements yield $k(T)$ that is a Boltzmann-weighted average of $k(E)$ over a broad internal-energy distribution; the thermal kernel has width on the order of $k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$ (or larger when the density of states is high), so features in $k(E)$ on energy scales smaller than this width are smoothed out. To recover $k(E)$, prepare ions with sharply defined internal energy using Threshold Photoelectron–Photoion Coincidence (TPEPICO), then measure unimolecular dissociation time distributions under single-collision conditions while scanning the photon energy to map $k(E)$.\n\nB. Canonical averaging emphasizes the lowest-energy molecules, which exaggerates non-RRKM features. To recover $k(E)$, increase the bath pressure so that intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR) becomes very fast and measure high-pressure-limit kinetics.\n\nC. In the canonical ensemble the total energy is fixed, so $k(T)$ is identical to $k(E)$ at $E=\\langle E\\rangle$. To recover $k(E)$, use multiphoton infrared excitation to deposit a broad band of energies in a single experiment.\n\nD. Canonical averaging removes the dependence on the density of states, so any deviations from Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel–Marcus (RRKM) theory vanish. The only way to recover them is to fit steady-state thermal kinetics over a wide temperature range using a non-Arrhenius model.", "solution": "We begin from fundamental statistical-mechanical definitions. In the microcanonical picture of unimolecular reaction, the rate constant $k(E,J)$ at fixed total energy $E$ and total angular momentum $J$ can be written in Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel–Marcus (RRKM) theory as\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{RRKM}}(E,J) = \\frac{N^{\\ddagger}(E-E_{0},J)}{h\\,\\rho(E,J)} \\,,\n$$\nwhere $N^{\\ddagger}(E-E_{0},J)$ is the sum of states of the transition-state dividing surface up to $E-E_{0}$, $\\rho(E,J)$ is the reactant density of states, $E_{0}$ is the threshold, and $h$ is Planck’s constant. In general (including non-RRKM systems), one can still define a true microcanonical rate $k(E)$ that reflects both the phase-space bottlenecks and any dynamical constraints such as incomplete intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR).\n\nThermal experiments at temperature $T$ probe a canonical ensemble. The canonical probability density of internal energies is\n$$\nP(E;T) = \\frac{\\rho(E)\\,e^{-\\beta E}}{Q(T)} \\,,\n$$\nwhere $\\beta = 1/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)$, $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is Boltzmann’s constant, and $Q(T) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\rho(E)\\,e^{-\\beta E}\\,dE$ is the partition function (after coarse-graining over levels). For any energy-dependent observable $A(E)$, the canonical average is\n$$\n\\langle A \\rangle_{T} = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} A(E)\\,P(E;T)\\,dE \\,.\n$$\nThus, the thermal rate constant $k(T)$ measured in canonical conditions is\n$$\nk(T) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} k(E)\\,P(E;T)\\,dE = \\frac{\\int_{0}^{\\infty} k(E)\\,\\rho(E)\\,e^{-\\beta E}\\,dE}{\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\rho(E)\\,e^{-\\beta E}\\,dE} \\,.\n$$\nThis shows that $k(T)$ is a Boltzmann-weighted average (a Laplace transform ratio) of the microcanonical $k(E)$ with an energy kernel of effective width on the order of $k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$, broadened further by the rapidly increasing density of states $\\rho(E)$ for polyatomics.\n\nWhy does this mask non-RRKM features? Consider a simple illustration in which $k(E)$ has oscillations on an energy scale $\\Delta E$:\n$$\nk(E) = k_{0}\\left[1 + a\\cos(\\omega E)\\right], \\quad \\omega = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\Delta E}, \\quad |a|1 \\,.\n$$\nNeglecting the slow variation of $\\rho(E)$ for the purpose of illustrating the smoothing, the relevant integral involves\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-\\beta E}\\cos(\\omega E)\\,dE = \\operatorname{Re}\\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-(\\beta - i\\omega)E}\\,dE = \\frac{\\beta}{\\beta^{2}+\\omega^{2}} \\,.\n$$\nTherefore, the oscillation amplitude in the canonical average is suppressed by a factor\n$$\n\\frac{\\beta}{\\sqrt{\\beta^{2}+\\omega^{2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+(\\omega/\\beta)^{2}}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+\\left(\\frac{2\\pi k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}{\\Delta E}\\right)^{2}}} \\,.\n$$\nWhen the microcanonical structure varies on scales $\\Delta E \\ll k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$, the suppression factor is $\\ll 1$, and the oscillations are effectively washed out. In real polyatomics, the growth of $\\rho(E)$ with $E$ shifts weight toward higher energies while maintaining a broad kernel width, further smoothing narrow features such as step-like onsets at specific bottlenecks or mode-specific IVR thresholds. Consequently, $k(T)$ appears smooth and often Arrhenius-like even when $k(E)$ exhibits pronounced non-RRKM structure.\n\nHow can one recover energy-resolved $k(E)$ experimentally? The principle is to prepare a microcanonical ensemble with a narrow internal-energy spread $\\delta E \\ll \\Delta E$ and to measure time-dependent decay under single-collision (or collision-free) conditions so that the survival probability $S(t;E)$ obeys\n$$\nS(t;E) \\approx e^{-k(E)t} \\,,\n$$\nfrom which $k(E)$ is obtained by fitting. A widely used, scientifically sound protocol for ions is Threshold Photoelectron–Photoion Coincidence (TPEPICO):\n\n- Energy selection: Photoionize a neutral at photon energy $h\\nu$ and detect only threshold photoelectrons with kinetic energy $\\approx 0$, so that by energy conservation the internal energy of the nascent ion is $E_{\\mathrm{int}} \\approx h\\nu - \\mathrm{IE}$, where $\\mathrm{IE}$ is the ionization energy. Gating on near-zero electron kinetic energy yields a narrow $E_{\\mathrm{int}}$ distribution.\n\n- Time-resolved kinetics: Under low-pressure, single-collision conditions, record the dissociation time distribution of the mass-selected parent ions to obtain $S(t;E_{\\mathrm{int}})$ and thus $k(E_{\\mathrm{int}})$.\n\n- Energy scan: Repeat while scanning $h\\nu$ to map $k(E)$ with microcanonical resolution. For neutrals, an analogous approach uses a supersonic beam to prepare cold molecules and a narrowband single-photon excitation to deposit a well-defined internal energy, followed by pump–probe detection of $S(t;E)$.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. This option correctly states that $k(T)$ is a Boltzmann-weighted average over $k(E)$ with a broad kernel of width $\\sim k_{\\mathrm{B}}T$ (broadened by $\\rho(E)$), which smooths features narrower than that scale. The proposed TPEPICO protocol is a realistic, established method to prepare ions with well-defined internal energy and to measure $k(E)$ via time-resolved unimolecular decay while scanning energy. Verdict — Correct.\n\nB. Canonical averaging does not “emphasize the lowest-energy molecules”; the weight is $\\rho(E)e^{-\\beta E}$, which often peaks away from the very lowest energies for large $\\rho(E)$. Increasing pressure accelerates IVR and drives systems toward the high-pressure limit, further masking non-RRKM effects and not providing microcanonical resolution. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nC. In the canonical ensemble, the energy is not fixed; it is distributed according to $P(E;T)$. Thus $k(T)\\neq k(E=\\langle E\\rangle)$ in general. Multiphoton infrared excitation broadens the internal-energy distribution, which is counterproductive for resolving $k(E)$. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nD. Canonical averaging does not remove dependence on $\\rho(E)$; it explicitly contains $\\rho(E)$ in the weighting. Fitting steady-state thermal kinetics over temperature still yields an average $k(T)$ and cannot, by itself, uniquely recover the microcanonical $k(E)$ or reveal fine non-RRKM structure.
