It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or factual inaccuracies. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation of the nonadiabatic electron transfer (ET) rate constant begins with Fermi's Golden Rule, which gives the transition rate between an initial state $|i\\rangle$ and a set of final states $|f\\rangle$:\n$$\nk = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\hbar} |\\langle i | \\hat{H}' | f \\rangle|^2 \\rho(E_f)\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{H}'$ is the perturbation Hamiltonian that couples the states, and $\\rho(E_f)$ is the density of final states. For electron transfer, the initial state is the reactant (donor-acceptor pair, $D-A$) and the final state is the product ($D^+-A^-$). The perturbation is the electronic coupling between them, denoted by the matrix element $V$. The overall rate constant $k_{ET}$ is obtained by performing a thermal average over the manifold of initial vibronic states and summing over all final vibronic states.\n\nIn the context of Marcus theory, the complex nuclear motions of the solvent and the reactants are modeled by a single collective solvent coordinate, $q$. The free energy of the system as a function of this coordinate is described by two intersecting parabolas, representing the reactant ($R$) and product ($P$) electronic states:\n$$\nG_R(q) = \\frac{1}{2} C q^2\n$$\n$$\nG_P(q) = \\frac{1}{2} C (q - \\Delta q_0)^2 + \\Delta G^\\circ\n$$\nHere, the equilibrium configuration for the reactant state is at $q=0$, and for the product state at $q=\\Delta q_0$. $\\Delta G^\\circ$ is the standard Gibbs free energy change of the reaction. The constant $C$ is a force constant for the solvent's harmonic response.\n\nThe reorganization energy, $\\lambda$, is defined as the energy required to distort the reactant system from its equilibrium nuclear geometry to that of the product state, without the electron transfer occurring. In this model, it is the energy of the reactant parabola at the product's equilibrium coordinate:\n$$\n\\lambda = G_R(\\Delta q_0) = \\frac{1}{2} C (\\Delta q_0)^2\n$$\nElectron transfer occurs most favorably at the nuclear configuration $q^\\ddagger$ where the two free energy surfaces intersect, i.e., $G_R(q^\\ddagger) = G_P(q^\\ddagger)$. This is the transition state configuration. The free energy required to reach this intersection point from the bottom of the reactant well is the activation free energy, $\\Delta G^\\ddagger$. Solving for the intersection gives:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2} C (q^\\ddagger)^2 = \\frac{1}{2} C (q^\\ddagger - \\Delta q_0)^2 + \\Delta G^\\circ\n$$\nThis yields the classical Marcus expression for the activation free energy:\n$$\n\\Delta G^\\ddagger = \\frac{(\\lambda + \\Delta G^\\circ)^2}{4\\lambda}\n$$\nThe total rate constant can be expressed as the product of an electronic factor and a nuclear factor. For a nonadiabatic reaction ($|V|$ is small), the rate is given by:\n$$\nk_{ET} = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\hbar} |V|^2 (\\text{FCWD})\n$$\nwhere FCWD is the Franck-Condon weighted density of states. In the classical, high-temperature limit, a rigorous evaluation of the FCWD, which involves averaging over the Boltzmann distribution of the reactant's nuclear configurations, yields:\n$$\n\\text{FCWD} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{4\\pi\\lambda k_B T}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta G^\\ddagger}{k_B T}\\right)\n$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the absolute temperature.
