The problem is self-contained, objective, and does not violate any fundamental principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. I will proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\n**Derivation of Validity Condition and Error Estimate**\n\nIn the interaction picture with respect to the system Hamiltonian $H_{\\mathrm{S}}$, the Redfield master equation for the reduced density operator $\\tilde{\\rho}_{\\mathrm{S}}(t) = e^{\\mathrm{i}H_{\\mathrm{S}}t/\\hbar} \\rho_{\\mathrm{S}}(t) e^{-\\mathrm{i}H_{\\mathrm{S}}t/\\hbar}$ takes the form:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\tilde{\\rho}_{\\mathrm{S}}(t) = \\mathcal{L}(t)[\\tilde{\\rho}_{\\mathrm{S}}(t)]\n$$\nwhere $\\mathcal{L}(t)$ is the Redfield superoperator. When this equation is expressed in the basis of eigenstates of $H_{\\mathrm{S}}$, its matrix elements evolve as:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt}\\tilde{\\rho}_{mn}(t) = \\sum_{k,l} R_{mn,kl} e^{\\mathrm{i}(\\omega_{mn} - \\omega_{kl})t} \\tilde{\\rho}_{kl}(t)\n$$\nHere, $\\tilde{\\rho}_{mn}(t) = \\langle m | \\tilde{\\rho}_{\\mathrm{S}}(t) | n \\rangle$, and the $R_{mn,kl}$ are the time-independent Redfield tensor elements, whose magnitudes determine the characteristic relaxation and dephasing rates, collectively denoted by $\\gamma$. The terms $e^{\\mathrm{i}(\\omega_{mn} - \\omega_{kl})t}$ arise from the transformation of the system operators into the interaction picture.\n\nThe secular approximation consists of neglecting all terms for which the transition frequencies are different, i.e., where $\\omega_{mn} \\neq \\omega_{kl}$. The terms that are kept, with $\\omega_{mn} = \\omega_{kl}$, are time-independent and lead to a GKSL-form master equation. The discarded terms are the \"nonsecular\" terms, which oscillate at frequencies $\\Delta\\omega = \\omega_{mn} - \\omega_{kl}$.\n\nThe justification for this approximation rests on a separation of timescales. The density matrix elements $\\tilde{\\rho}_{kl}(t)$ evolve on a slow timescale, determined by the relaxation rates, which is of order $1/\\gamma$. The nonsecular terms oscillate with a period of $2\\pi/|\\Delta\\omega|$. If these oscillations are much faster than the evolution of $\\tilde{\\rho}_{kl}(t)$, their effect can be averaged out over a coarse-graining time $T$. This requires that the oscillation period is much shorter than the evolution timescale:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{|\\Delta\\omega|} \\ll \\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\implies |\\Delta\\omega| \\gg \\gamma\n$$\nThis condition must hold for all relevant non-zero frequency differences $\\Delta\\omega$. The most stringent condition is set by the smallest such difference, $\\Delta = \\min_{\\omega_{mn} \\neq \\omega_{kl}}|\\omega_{mn} - \\omega_{kl}|$. Thus, the validity condition for the secular approximation is $\\Delta \\gg \\gamma$.\nThis condition ensures the existence of a coarse-graining timescale $T$ such that $1/\\Delta \\ll T \\ll 1/\\gamma$. Over this time $T$, the fast oscillating terms $\\exp(\\mathrm{i}\\Delta\\omega t)$ average to approximately zero, while the slowly varying density matrix elements $\\tilde{\\rho}_{kl}(t)$ remain almost constant. The full timescale hierarchy for the problem, including the Markovian assumption ($\\tau_c \\ll 1/\\gamma$), allows for a coarse-graining time $T$ satisfying $\\max\\{\\tau_c, 1/\\Delta\\} \\ll T \\ll 1/\\gamma$.\n\nThe leading-order relative error introduced by this approximation can be estimated. The nonsecular terms act as a fast drive on the system. The response of a slow system (evolving with rate $\\gamma$) to a fast drive oscillating at frequency $\\Delta$ is suppressed by the ratio of the rates. The magnitude of the Redfield tensor elements $R_{mn,kl}$ is of order $\\gamma$. The magnitude of the nonsecular terms in the generator is therefore of order $\\gamma$. However, their effective contribution to the dynamics is reduced. The resulting correction to the density matrix elements is of order $\\gamma/\\Delta$. This implies that the relative error in the dissipator, or the rates of the master equation, scales as:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Error} \\sim \\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{\\gamma}{\\Delta}\\right)\n$$\n\n**Numerical Evaluation**\nWe are given the system parameters:\n- $\\omega_{21} = 2\\pi \\times 1.00 \\times 10^{12}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $\\omega_{32} = 2\\pi \\times 1.03 \\times 10^{12}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n- $\\gamma = 2\\pi \\times 1.00 \\times 10^{9}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$\n\nFirst, we find the set of distinct positive Bohr frequencies.

The energy-gap fluctuations $\\delta E(t)$ along a classical Molecular Dynamics (MD) trajectory form a stationary, real stochastic process with zero mean after removing the sample average. Its classical equilibrium autocorrelation function is defined as $C_{\\mathrm{cl}}(t) = \\langle \\delta E(t)\\,\\delta E(0)\\rangle$, which in practice is estimated via a time average over a single sufficiently long trajectory. The classical, symmetrized power spectrum is defined via the cosine transform\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{cl}}(\\omega) = 2 \\int_{0}^{\\infty} C_{\\mathrm{cl}}(t)\\,\\cos(\\omega t)\\, dt.\n$$\nThis is a standard definition for a real, even correlation function, and $S_{\\mathrm{cl}}(\\omega)$ has units of $\\mathrm{J}^2\\cdot \\mathrm{s}$.\n\nFor a harmonic bath linearly coupled to the system coordinate, the quantum symmetrized correlation function is related to the bath spectral density $J(\\omega)$ through the fluctuation-dissipation structure (for $\\omega  0$):\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{q}}(t) = \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\int_{0}^{\\infty} d\\omega\\; J(\\omega)\\,\\coth\\!\\left(\\frac{\\beta \\hbar \\omega}{2}\\right)\\cos(\\omega t),\n$$\nwhere $\\beta = 1/(k_{\\mathrm{B}} T)$, $k_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant.
