It does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\n\nThe problem is valid. A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Fundamental Relations\n\nFirst, we combine the constitutive relation and the conservation law.\nSubstituting $\\mathbf{J} = -D \\nabla c$ into $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} = 0$, and using the fact that $D$ is a spatially uniform constant, we obtain the diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = \\nabla \\cdot (D \\nabla c) = D \\nabla^2 c\n$$\nThis is the governing partial differential equation (PDE) for the concentration field $c(\\mathbf{x}, t)$.\n\nSecond, we formulate the constraint imposed by the second law of thermodynamics. The local entropy production density, $\\sigma_s$, for diffusion under isothermal ($T=\\text{const}$) and isobaric ($p=\\text{const}$) conditions is given by the product of the thermodynamic flux and force:\n$$\n\\sigma_s = -\\frac{1}{T} \\mathbf{J} \\cdot \\nabla \\mu\n$$\nThe second law requires $\\sigma_s \\ge 0$.\nThe problem states the solute is an ideal dilute component. Its chemical potential $\\mu$ is given by:\n$$\n\\mu(c, T, p) = \\mu^{\\ominus}(T, p) + k_B T \\ln(c)\n$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $\\mu^{\\ominus}$ is a reference potential dependent only on $T$ and $p$. Since $T$ and $p$ are uniform, the gradient of $\\mu$ is:\n$$\n\\nabla \\mu = \\nabla(\\mu^{\\ominus} + k_B T \\ln c) = k_B T \\nabla(\\ln c) = k_B T \\frac{1}{c} \\nabla c\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $\\mathbf{J}$ and $\\nabla\\mu$ into the formula for entropy production:\n$$\n\\sigma_s = -\\frac{1}{T} (-D \\nabla c) \\cdot \\left(k_B T \\frac{1}{c} \\nabla c\\right) = \\frac{D k_B}{c} (\\nabla c)^2 = \\frac{D k_B}{c} |\\nabla c|^2\n$$\nThe second law of thermodynamics mandates that $\\sigma_s \\ge 0$. Since $k_B  0$, the concentration $c$ must be non-negative ($c \\ge 0$), and $|\\nabla c|^2 \\ge 0$. For any region where $c  0$ and the concentration is not uniform ($\\nabla c \\neq \\mathbf{0}$), the inequality $\\sigma_s \\ge 0$ can only be satisfied if $D \\ge 0$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. The second law requires $D \\ge 0$; if $D  0$, there exist concentration fields with $\\nabla c \\ne \\mathbf{0}$ for which the local entropy production density is strictly negative wherever $c  0$.**\n\nAs derived above, $\\sigma_s = \\frac{D k_B}{c} |\\nabla c|^2$. The second law requires $\\sigma_s \\ge 0$, which implies $D \\ge 0$. This validates the first part of the statement. For the second part, assume $D  0$. If we choose any concentration field where $\\nabla c \\neq \\mathbf{0}$ and $c  0$ (a non-uniform concentration distribution), then $D  0$, $k_B  0$, $c  0$, and $|\\nabla c|^2  0$. The product of these terms will be strictly negative: $\\sigma_s  0$. This violates the second law. Thus, the statement is a direct and correct consequence of the thermodynamic principles outlined.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. If $D  0$, the linearized evolution of a small perturbation $\\delta c(\\mathbf{x}, t)$ about a uniform state $c_0  0$ contains spatial Fourier modes of the form $\\exp\\!\\left(\\mathrm{i}\\,\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{x}\\right)$ that grow as $\\exp\\!\\left(|D|\\,k^2\\, t\\right)$, so arbitrarily short wavelengths amplify fastest, rendering the initial-value problem ill-posed.**\n\nWe perform a linear stability analysis of the diffusion equation $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = D \\nabla^2 c$. Let $c(\\mathbf{x}, t) = c_0 + \\delta c(\\mathbf{x}, t)$, where $c_0$ is a constant background concentration. The linearized equation for the perturbation $\\delta c$ is $\\frac{\\partial (\\delta c)}{\\partial t} = D \\nabla^2 (\\delta c)$. We consider a single spatial Fourier mode for the perturbation: $\\delta c(\\mathbf{x}, t) = \\hat{c}(t) e^{i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}}$. Substituting this into the PDE yields:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\hat{c}}{dt} e^{i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}} = D \\hat{c}(t) \\nabla^2(e^{i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}}) = D \\hat{c}(t) (-k^2) e^{i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}}\n$$\nwhere $k = |\\mathbf{k}|$ is the wavenumber. This gives the ordinary differential equation for the amplitude $\\hat{c}(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{d\\hat{c}}{dt} = -D k^2 \\hat{c}(t)\n$$\nThe solution is $\\hat{c}(t) = \\hat{c}(0) e^{-D k^2 t}$. Now, let $D  0$, so we can write $D = -|D|$. The solution becomes:\n$$\n\\hat{c}(t) = \\hat{c}(0) e^{-(-|D|) k^2 t} = \\hat{c}(0) e^{|D| k^2 t}\n$$\nThis shows exponential growth with a rate $\\omega(k) = |D| k^2$. The growth rate increases quadratically with the wavenumber $k$. As $k \\to \\infty$ (i.e., for arbitrarily short wavelengths $\\lambda = 2\\pi/k \\to 0$), the growth rate $\\omega(k) \\to \\infty$. This means that high-frequency noise will be amplified almost instantaneously, a classic feature of a mathematically ill-posed problem (specifically, a violation of Hadamard well-posedness). The statement is entirely correct. This equation is known as the backward heat equation.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. Any apparent violation of the second law for $D  0$ can be removed by redefining the entropy flux while keeping $\\mathbf{J} = - D \\nabla c$; therefore negative $D$ is thermodynamically admissible without altering the driving force.**\n\nThe structure of non-equilibrium thermodynamics is not arbitrary. The local entropy production $\\sigma_s$ is identified as a sum of products of conjugate thermodynamic fluxes $\\mathbf{J}_i$ and forces $\\mathbf{X}_i$, i.e., $\\sigma_s = \\sum_i \\mathbf{J}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{X}_i$. In this problem, the flux is $\\mathbf{J}$ and the force is $\\mathbf{X} = -\\frac{1}{T}\\nabla \\mu$. The entropy production is $\\sigma_s = \\mathbf{J} \\cdot \\mathbf{X}$. The statement suggests keeping both the flux ($\\mathbf{J} = -D\\nabla c$) and the driving force ($\\nabla \\mu$, which is the gradient part of $\\mathbf{X}$) fixed. If $\\mathbf{J}$ and $\\mathbf{X}$ are fixed, their product $\\sigma_s$ is also fixed. The entropy balance equation is $\\partial s/\\partial t + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J}_s = \\sigma_s$. While one could mathematically define a new entropy flux $\\mathbf{J}_s' = \\mathbf{J}_s + \\mathbf{V}$ leading to a new \"production\" term $\\sigma_s' = \\sigma_s - \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{V}$, this is a physically meaningless procedure. The decomposition into fluxes, forces, and entropy production is based on fundamental physical principles, not arbitrary mathematical re-definitions. The violation of the second law for $D  0$ is physical, not \"apparent.\"\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. In an ideal dilute solution at fixed $T$ and $p$, the sign of $D$ equals the sign of the Onsager coefficient $L$ in the linear law $\\mathbf{J} = - (L/T)\\,\\nabla \\mu$, and since $L  0$ by positive definiteness of the Onsager matrix, $D$ must be positive.**\n\nLinear non-equilibrium thermodynamics postulates a linear relationship between fluxes and forces: $\\mathbf{J} = L \\mathbf{X}$. Here, the flux is $\\mathbf{J}$ and the force is $\\mathbf{X} = -\\frac{1}{T}\\nabla \\mu$. So, the Onsager relation is $\\mathbf{J} = - \\frac{L}{T} \\nabla \\mu$. We compare this with Fick's law, $\\mathbf{J} = -D \\nabla c$. Using our previously derived result for $\\nabla \\mu$ in an ideal dilute solution:\n$$\n-D \\nabla c = -\\frac{L}{T} \\left(k_B T \\frac{\\nabla c}{c}\\right) = -\\frac{L k_B}{c} \\nabla c\n$$\nFor this equality to hold for any $\\nabla c$, we must have:\n$$\nD = \\frac{L k_B}{c}\n$$\nSince $k_B  0$ and $c  0$, the sign of $D$ is identical to the sign of the Onsager coefficient $L$. A fundamental result, derived from the second law and microscopic reversibility, is that the matrix of Onsager coefficients is positive semi-definite. For a single independent process, this means the scalar coefficient $L$ must be non-negative, $L \\ge 0$. For any real transport to occur, $L$ must be strictly positive, $L  0$. It follows necessarily that $D$ must be positive. This statement provides a correct and fundamental argument for the positivity of the diffusion coefficient.\n\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**E. Even if $D  0$, the diffusion partial differential equation remains well-posed under periodic boundary conditions because total solute mass is conserved and the $L^2$ norm of $c$ cannot increase in time.**\n\nThe total mass is $M(t) = \\int_\\Omega c(\\mathbf{x}, t) \\, dV$. Its time derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{dM}{dt} = \\int_\\Omega \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} \\, dV = \\int_\\Omega D \\nabla^2 c \\, dV = D \\int_\\Omega \\nabla \\cdot (\\nabla c) \\, dV = D \\oint_{\\partial \\Omega} \\nabla c \\cdot d\\mathbf{S}\n$$\nFor periodic boundary conditions, the surface integral is zero, so $\\frac{dM}{dt} = 0$. Total mass is conserved regardless of the sign of $D$. The first part of the claim is true.\nNow consider the time evolution of the squared $L^2$ norm, $\\|c\\|^2_{L^2} = \\int_\\Omega c^2 \\, dV$.\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\int_\\Omega c^2 \\, dV = \\int_\\Omega 2c \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} \\, dV = \\int_\\Omega 2c (D \\nabla^2 c) \\, dV\n$$\nUsing Green's first identity and periodic boundary conditions, the boundary term vanishes:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} \\|c\\|^2_{L^2} = 2D \\left( \\oint_{\\partial \\Omega} c \\nabla c \\cdot d\\mathbf{S} - \\int_\\Omega |\\nabla c|^2 \\, dV \\right) = -2D \\int_\\Omega |\\nabla c|^2 \\, dV\n$$\nIf $D  0$, let $D = -|D|$. Then $\\frac{d}{dt} \\|c\\|^2_{L^2} = 2|D| \\int_\\Omega |\\nabla c|^2 \\, dV$. Since $\\int_\\Omega |\\nabla c|^2 \\, dV \\ge 0$, the time derivative is non-negative. The $L^2$ norm will increase if the solution is not uniform. The statement's claim that the $L^2$ norm *cannot increase* is false. Furthermore, as shown in the analysis of option B, the problem is ill-posed for $D  0$. Conservation of mass is insufficient to guarantee well-posedness.\n\n**Verdict: Incorrect**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABD}$$", "id": "2484525"}]}
