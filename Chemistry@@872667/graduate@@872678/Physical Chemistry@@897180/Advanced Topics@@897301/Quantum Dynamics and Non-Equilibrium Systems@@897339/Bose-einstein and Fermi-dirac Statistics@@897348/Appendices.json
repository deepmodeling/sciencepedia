Therefore, we proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe fundamental principle for this derivation is the conservation of the total number of particles, $N$. The number of particles is constant at any temperature $T$. At absolute zero, $T=0$, the Fermi-Dirac distribution function is a step function: $f(\\varepsilon, T=0)=1$ for $\\varepsilon  \\varepsilon_{F}$ and $f(\\varepsilon, T=0)=0$ for $\\varepsilon  \\varepsilon_{F}$, where $\\varepsilon_{F}$ is the Fermi energy, which equals the chemical potential at $T=0$, i.e., $\\mu(0) = \\varepsilon_{F}$.

The shift from $\\varepsilon_{F}$ is negative and quadratically dependent on temperature ($ \\propto T^{2}$). This behavior is a direct consequence of the need to conserve the total number of particles $N$ in a system where the density of states $D(\\varepsilon)$ is an increasing function of energy (for a $3$-dimensional gas, $D(\\varepsilon) \\propto \\varepsilon^{1/2}$). At finite temperature, the Fermi-Dirac distribution \"smears out\", causing some particles to be thermally excited from states below $\\mu$ to states above $\\mu$. Because $D(\\varepsilon)$ is larger at higher energies, more states are available for occupation above $\\mu$ than are being vacated below $\\mu$. If $\\mu$ were to remain constant at $\\varepsilon_{F}$, this asymmetric smearing into a region of higher state density would lead to an increase in the total particle count. To maintain a constant $N$, the chemical potential must shift to a lower energy, thereby slightly reducing the overall occupation of states to precisely compensate for this effect. The $T^{2}$ dependence is characteristic of low-temperature phenomena in Fermi systems and arises from the mathematical structure of the Sommerfeld expansion.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\varepsilon_{F} - \\frac{\\pi^{2} (k_{B}T)^{2}}{12 \\varepsilon_{F}}}\n$$", "id": "2625463"}, {"introduction": "This practice explores a critically important class of systems where the number of particles is not conserved, such as photons in a blackbody cavity or phonons in a crystal.

It describes a standard physical system—a gas of non-interacting, non-conserved bosonic quasiparticles—and asks for an analysis based on the fundamental principles of statistical mechanics. The problem is valid, and the analysis will proceed.\n\nThe system is in thermal equilibrium at temperature $T$. According to the problem's guiding principle (i), the equilibrium state is found by maximizing the entropy $S$ subject to the constraints of conserved quantities. For this system, the total energy $E = \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} n_{\\mathbf{k}} \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}$ is conserved (exchanged with the medium, which acts as a heat bath at fixed $T$), but the total particle number $N = \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} n_{\\mathbf{k}}$ is not a conserved quantity.\n\nIn the grand canonical formalism, a chemical potential $\\mu$ is introduced as a Lagrange multiplier to enforce the conservation of the average particle number $\\langle N \\rangle$. The grand potential $\\Omega = F - \\mu N = E - TS - \\mu N$ is minimized at equilibrium. Equilibrium with respect to particle exchange with a reservoir requires that the chemical potentials are equal. Here, the medium can create or annihilate particles at no cost to any conserved charge, so it acts as a reservoir with chemical potential $0$. Alternatively, one can find the equilibrium particle number by minimizing the Helmholtz free energy $F(T, V, N) = E - TS$ with respect to $N$. The chemical potential is defined as $\\mu = \\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial N}\\right)_{T,V}$. Since $N$ is not constrained, the system will adjust $N$ until $F$ is at a minimum, which occurs when $\\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial N}\\right)_{T,V} = 0$. Therefore, the chemical potential for the non-conserved quasiparticles must be $\\mu=0$. This is also stated directly by the problem's principle (ii).\n\nWith $\\mu=0$, the mean occupation number of a single-particle state with energy $\\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}$ is given by the Bose-Einstein distribution, which simplifies to the Planck distribution:\n$$\n\\langle n_{\\mathbf{k}} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta(\\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}} - \\mu)} - 1} = \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}} - 1}\n$$\nwhere $\\beta = 1/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)$.\n\nNow, we evaluate each statement.\n\n**A.

Consequently, the mean occupation number for a mode of energy $\\epsilon$ is $\\langle n \\rangle = (e^{\\epsilon/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)} - 1)^{-1}$. This expression is a function solely of the dimensionless ratio $\\epsilon/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)$. The reasoning and the conclusion in the statement are both correct.\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**B. For such a nonconserved quasiparticle gas in volume $V$, the total number $N$ is not constrained and exhibits extensive fluctuations with variance proportional to $V$; consequently the relative fluctuations scale as $V^{-1/2}$ in the thermodynamic limit.**\nThe mean total number of particles is an extensive quantity, proportional to the volume $V$. This can be seen by converting the sum over modes $\\mathbf{k}$ to an integral over the density of states $D(\\epsilon)$:\n$$\n\\langle N \\rangle = \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} \\langle n_{\\mathbf{k}} \\rangle = \\int_0^\\infty d\\epsilon \\, D(\\epsilon) \\, \\frac{1}{e^{\\beta\\epsilon}-1}\n$$\nSince the density of states is itself extensive, $D(\\epsilon) \\propto V$, it follows that $\\langle N \\rangle \\propto V$.\nThe variance of the total number, for non-interacting particles, is the sum of the variances of the individual mode occupations: $\\mathrm{Var}(N) = \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} \\mathrm{Var}(n_{\\mathbf{k}})$. As will be shown in the analysis of option C, $\\mathrm{Var}(n_{\\mathbf{k}}) = \\langle n_{\\mathbf{k}} \\rangle (1 + \\langle n_{\\mathbf{k}} \\rangle) = \\langle n_{\\mathbf{k}} \\rangle + \\langle n_{\\mathbf{k}} \\rangle^2$.\nThus, $\\mathrm{Var}(N) = \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} (\\langle n_{\\mathbf{k}} \\rangle + \\langle n_{\\mathbf{k}} \\rangle^2) = \\langle N \\rangle + \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} \\langle n_{\\mathbf{k}} \\rangle^2$. Both terms on the right-hand side are extensive. $\\langle N \\rangle \\propto V$, and $\\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} \\langle n_{\\mathbf{k}} \\rangle^2$ also scales with $V$. Therefore, the total variance $\\mathrm{Var}(N)$ is an extensive quantity, i.e., $\\mathrm{Var}(N) \\propto V$.\nThe relative fluctuation is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean:\n$$\n\\frac{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}(N)}}{\\langle N \\rangle} \\propto \\frac{\\sqrt{V}}{V} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{V}} \\propto V^{-1/2}\n$$\nThis scaling is characteristic of fluctuations of extensive quantities in the thermodynamic limit.

With $\\mu=0$, we have $\\langle n_{\\mathbf{k}} \\rangle = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial(\\beta\\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}})} \\ln Z_{\\mathbf{k}}$.

Since $\\langle n_{\\mathbf{k}} \\rangle > 0$, the variance $\\mathrm{Var}(n_{\\mathbf{k}}) = \\langle n_{\\mathbf{k}} \\rangle + \\langle n_{\\mathbf{k}} \\rangle^2$ is strictly greater than the mean $\\langle n_{\\mathbf{k}} \\rangle$. This is the definition of super-Poissonian statistics, which reflects the tendency of bosons to occupy the same quantum state, a phenomenon known as bunching.\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n**D. In equilibrium, the chemical potential must be strictly negative, $\\mu0$, to prevent a divergence of the occupation at low energy; therefore $\\mu$ approaches $0$ from below as $T$ decreases.**\nThis statement describes the behavior of a gas of *conserved* bosons. In such a system, the chemical potential $\\mu$ is a parameter that is adjusted to maintain a fixed total number of particles $\\langle N \\rangle$. The occupation number $\\langle n_{\\mathbf{k}} \\rangle = (e^{\\beta(\\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}} - \\mu)} - 1)^{-1}$ must be positive, which requires $\\mu  \\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}}$ for all $\\mathbf{k}$. For a system with a ground state at $\\epsilon_0=0$, this means $\\mu$ must be strictly negative ($\\mu0$). As $T$ is lowered, $\\mu$ must approach $0$ from below to keep $\\langle N \\rangle$ constant, leading eventually to Bose-Einstein condensation. The system under consideration in the problem, however, has no particle number conservation. As established, its chemical potential is fixed at $\\mu=0$. This statement is factually correct for a different physical system but incorrect for the one specified in the problem.\n**Verdict:** Incorrect.\n\n**E. In true thermal equilibrium without any external constraint on $N$, these quasiparticles cannot undergo Bose–Einstein condensation by cooling alone, even if the dispersion is gapless, because the chemical potential is pinned and cannot reach the ground-state energy.**\nBose-Einstein condensation (BEC) is the macroscopic occupation of the ground state, which occurs when the chemical potential $\\mu$ becomes equal to the ground-state energy $\\epsilon_0$. Let's consider a gapless dispersion, where $\\epsilon_0=0$. For the non-conserved gas, $\\mu=0$ is fixed for all $T > 0$. Thus, $\\mu=\\epsilon_0$ is always satisfied. However, the condensation mechanism is absent. In a conserved gas, cooling forces particles into the ground state because the excited states have a maximum capacity that decreases with $T$. Here, there is no conserved total number $N$. As the system is cooled, the equilibrium number of particles $\\langle N \\rangle = \\int d\\epsilon D(\\epsilon) (e^{\\beta\\epsilon}-1)^{-1}$ simply decreases. As $T \\to 0$, $\\beta \\to \\infty$, and $\\langle n_{\\mathbf{k}} \\rangle \\to 0$ for all $\\epsilon_{\\mathbf{k}} > 0$. The total particle number vanishes: $\\langle N \\rangle \\to 0$. The system relaxes to its true ground state, which is the vacuum (zero particles). No macroscopic occupation of any state occurs.\nThe statement's conclusion is correct: BEC does not occur. The reason given is that \"the chemical potential is pinned\". This pinning at $\\mu=0$ is indeed the reason the standard BEC mechanism fails. The phrase \"and cannot reach the ground-state energy\" is slightly imprecise for the gapless case (where $\\mu = \\epsilon_0 = 0$), but it is perfectly accurate for a gapped system (where $\\epsilon_0 > 0$ and $\\mu=0  \\epsilon_0$). In either case, the pinning of $\\mu$ prevents it from being a dynamic variable that is forced towards $\\epsilon_0$ by the constraint of number conservation, which is the essential feature of BEC. The physical reasoning is fundamentally sound.\n**Verdict:** Correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABCE}$$", "id": "2625440"}]}
