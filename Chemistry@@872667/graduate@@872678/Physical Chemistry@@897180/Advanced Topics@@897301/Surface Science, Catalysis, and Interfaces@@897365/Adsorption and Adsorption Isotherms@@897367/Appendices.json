A full solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution proceeds in four parts as requested: derivation, calculation, interpretation, and final averaging.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Isosteric Heat of Adsorption Relation**\nThe condition for thermodynamic equilibrium for adsorption is the equality of the chemical potential of the gas species in the gas phase, $\\mu_g$, and in the adsorbed phase, $\\mu_a$:\n$$ \\mu_g(T, P) = \\mu_a(T, \\theta) $$\nwhere $T$ is the temperature, $P$ is the gas pressure, and $\\theta$ is the fractional surface coverage. For any change that maintains equilibrium, the differentials must be equal: $d\\mu_g = d\\mu_a$. It is more rigorous to work with the chemical potentials divided by temperature. At equilibrium:\n$$ \\frac{\\mu_g(T, P)}{T} = \\frac{\\mu_a(T, \\theta)}{T} $$\nWe are interested in the relationship between $P$ and $T$ at constant coverage $\\theta$. We differentiate the above equation with respect to $T$ while holding $\\theta$ constant. Note that $P$ is implicitly a function of $T$ along an isostere (a line of constant $\\theta$).\n$$ \\left( \\frac{d}{dT} \\left( \\frac{\\mu_g}{T} \\right) \\right)_{\\theta} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\left( \\frac{\\mu_a}{T} \\right) \\right)_{\\theta} $$\nThe left-hand side is a total derivative with respect to $T$ at constant $\\theta$. We apply the chain rule, recognizing that $\\mu_g$ is a function of $T$ and $P$:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\left( \\frac{\\mu_g}{T} \\right) \\right)_{P} + \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial P} \\left( \\frac{\\mu_g}{T} \\right) \\right)_{T} \\left( \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial T} \\right)_{\\theta} = \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\left( \\frac{\\mu_a}{T} \\right) \\right)_{\\theta} $$\nWe now evaluate each term. The Gibbs-Helmholtz equation states that $\\left(\\frac{\\partial (\\mu/T)}{\\partial T}\\right)_{P} = -\\frac{H_m}{T^2}$, where $H_m$ is the molar enthalpy. Applying this to the gas and adsorbed phases:\n- For the gas phase: $\\left( \\frac{\\partial (\\mu_g/T)}{\\partial T} \\right)_{P} = -\\frac{H_g}{T^2}$, where $H_g$ is the molar enthalpy of the gas.\n- For the adsorbed phase: We define the differential molar enthalpy of the adsorbate as $H_a$, such that $\\left( \\frac{\\partial (\\mu_a/T)}{\\partial T} \\right)_{\\theta} = -\\frac{H_a}{T^2}$.\n\nFor the term involving the pressure derivative, we use the expression for the chemical potential of an ideal gas: $\\mu_g(T, P) = \\mu_g^\\circ(T) + RT \\ln(P/P^\\circ)$, where $P^\\circ$ is a standard pressure.\n$$ \\frac{\\mu_g}{T} = \\frac{\\mu_g^\\circ(T)}{T} + R \\ln\\left(\\frac{P}{P^\\circ}\\right) $$\nDifferentiating with respect to $P$ at constant $T$:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial P} \\left( \\frac{\\mu_g}{T} \\right) \\right)_{T} = \\frac{R}{P} $$\nSubstituting these expressions back into the central equation:\n$$ -\\frac{H_g}{T^2} + \\frac{R}{P} \\left( \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial T} \\right)_{\\theta} = -\\frac{H_a}{T^2} $$\nRearranging to solve for the pressure-temperature relationship:\n$$ \\frac{R}{P} \\left( \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial T} \\right)_{\\theta} = \\frac{H_g - H_a}{T^2} $$\nThe isosteric heat of adsorption, $q_{st}$, is defined as the heat evolved when one mole of gas adsorbs onto the surface at constant coverage. For an exothermic process like physisorption, $q_{st}$ is positive. It is defined as the negative of the differential enthalpy of adsorption: $q_{st} = -\\Delta H_{ads} = -(H_a - H_g) = H_g - H_a$.\nSubstituting $q_{st}$ into the equation yields:\n$$ \\frac{R}{P} \\left( \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial T} \\right)_{\\theta} = \\frac{q_{st}}{T^2} $$\nThis expression can be rearranged for easier integration by noting that $\\frac{1}{P} \\frac{dP}{dT} = \\frac{d\\ln P}{dT}$:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\ln P}{\\partial T} \\right)_{\\theta} = \\frac{q_{st}}{RT^2} $$\nFinally, using the transformation $d(1/T) = -1/T^2 \\, dT$, we arrive at the desired relation, an analogue of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\ln P}{\\partial (1/T)} \\right)_{\\theta} = -\\frac{q_{st}}{R} $$\nThis equation relates the temperature dependence of the equilibrium pressure at constant coverage to the isosteric heat of adsorption.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of $q_{st}(\\theta)$**\nThe derived relation can be approximated using a two-point finite difference method for the derivative, assuming $q_{st}$ is constant over the small temperature interval $[T_1, T_2]$:\n$$ \\frac{\\ln(P_2) - \\ln(P_1)}{1/T_2 - 1/T_1} \\approx -\\frac{q_{st}(\\theta)}{R} $$\nwhere $P_1$ and $P_2$ are the equilibrium pressures at temperatures $T_1$ and $T_2$ for a given coverage $\\theta$.\nSolving for $q_{st}(\\theta)$:\n$$ q_{st}(\\theta) \\approx -R \\frac{\\ln(P_2/P_1)}{1/T_2 - 1/T_1} $$\nGiven $T_1 = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$ and $T_2 = 320\\,\\mathrm{K}$, the denominator is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{320} - \\frac{1}{300} = \\frac{300 - 320}{300 \\times 320} = \\frac{-20}{96000} = -\\frac{1}{4800}\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $q_{st}(\\theta)$:\n$$ q_{st}(\\theta) \\approx -R \\frac{\\ln(P_2/P_1)}{-1/4800} = 4800 R \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right) $$\nUsing $R = 8.314462618\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$, we can now calculate $q_{st}$ for each value of $\\theta$:\n\n- For $\\theta=0.05$: $P_1 = 0.080\\,\\mathrm{bar}$, $P_2 = 0.122\\,\\mathrm{bar}$.\n$$ q_{st}(0.05) = 4800 \\times 8.314462618 \\times \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.122}{0.080}\\right) \\approx 16841.80\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} $$\n\n- For $\\theta=0.10$: $P_1 = 0.150\\,\\mathrm{bar}$, $P_2 = 0.230\\,\\mathrm{bar}$.\n$$ q_{st}(0.10) = 4800 \\times 8.314462618 \\times \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.230}{0.150}\\right) \\approx 17058.08\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} $$\n\n- For $\\theta=0.20$: $P_1 = 0.320\\,\\mathrm{bar}$, $P_2 = 0.520\\,\\mathrm{bar}$.\n$$ q_{st}(0.20) = 4800 \\times 8.314462618 \\times \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.520}{0.320}\\right) \\approx 19375.46\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} $$\n\n- For $\\theta=0.30$: $P_1 = 0.600\\,\\mathrm{bar}$, $P_2 = 1.050\\,\\mathrm{bar}$.\n$$ q_{st}(0.30) = 4800 \\times 8.314462618 \\times \\ln\\left(\\frac{1.050}{0.600}\\right) \\approx 22332.86\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} $$\n\n**Part 3: Interpretation of the Trend of $q_{st}(\\theta)$**\nThe calculated values of the isosteric heat of adsorption are approximately $16.8\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$, $17.1\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$, $19.4\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$, and $22.3\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$ for coverages of $0.05$, $0.10$, $0.20$, and $0.30$, respectively. It is observed that $q_{st}$ increases as the surface coverage $\\theta$ increases. This trend provides insight into the nature of the adsorption system. Two primary factors influence the coverage dependence of $q_{st}$: energetic heterogeneity of the surface and lateral interactions between adsorbed molecules.\n\n1.  **Energetic Heterogeneity**: If the adsorbent surface were energetically heterogeneous, it would possess a distribution of adsorption sites with varying adsorption energies. Adsorption would preferentially occur on the highest-energy sites first (those with the largest $q_{st}$). As coverage increases, molecules are forced to occupy lower-energy sites, which would result in a *decrease* of the measured $q_{st}$ with increasing $\\theta$. This is contrary to the observed trend.\n\n2.  **Lateral Interactions**: If the surface is energetically homogeneous, the change in $q_{st}$ must be due to interactions between adjacent adsorbed molecules (adsorbates).\n    - If these interactions are repulsive, an incoming molecule would be destabilized by its neighbors. This would make adsorption less favorable at higher coverages, causing $q_{st}$ to *decrease* with increasing $\\theta$.\n    - If these interactions are attractive, an incoming molecule would be stabilized by its neighbors. This cooperative effect enhances the overall binding energy, making adsorption more favorable at higher coverages. Consequently, the energy required to remove a molecule from the surface increases, leading to an *increase* of $q_{st}$ with increasing $\\theta$.\n\nSince the experimental data show a clear increase in $q_{st}$ with $\\theta$, the dominant phenomenon is attractive lateral interactions between the adsorbed gas molecules on the surface of the nonporous oxide.\n\n**Part 4: Calculation of the Mean Isosteric Heat of Adsorption**\nThe arithmetic mean of the four calculated $q_{st}$ values is:\n$$ \\overline{q_{st}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( q_{st}(0.05) + q_{st}(0.10) + q_{st}(0.20) + q_{st}(0.30) \\right) $$\n$$ \\overline{q_{st}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( 16841.80 + 17058.08 + 19375.46 + 22332.86 \\right) \\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} $$\n$$ \\overline{q_{st}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( 75608.20 \\right) \\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} = 18902.05 \\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} $$\nConverting to $\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$:\n$$ \\overline{q_{st}} = 18.90205 \\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} $$\nRounding to four significant figures as required:\n$$ \\overline{q_{st}} \\approx 18.90 \\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} $$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{18.90} $$", "id": "2467809"}, {"introduction": "In practical adsorption measurements, particularly at high pressures where the bulk fluid is dense, experiments typically report an *excess* amount adsorbed, not the *absolute* amount within the pores.

It presents a standard task in the physical chemistry of adsorption, requiring the conversion between excess and absolute adsorption amounts, which is a fundamental concept. The provided data are physically consistent and sufficient for a unique solution. We proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe relationship between the specific absolute adsorption, $n_{\\text{abs}}$ (total moles of adsorbate within the pore volume per unit mass of adsorbent), and the specific excess adsorption, $n_{\\text{ex}}$, is based on the Gibbs excess formalism. For a porous solid with a specific pore volume $V_{\\text{pore}}$ (volume per unit mass of adsorbent), the excess amount is defined as the absolute amount minus the amount of bulk fluid that would occupy the same pore volume at the given temperature $T$ and pressure $P$.

However, the problem provides the assumed density of the adsorbed phase, $\\rho_{\\text{ads}}$. The physical model underlying this problem assumes that the entire pore space is filled by the adsorbed phase.

For each test case, generate a statistically stationary synthetic GCMC trajectory as follows.\n   - Draw $M$ independent particle counts $N_t \\sim \\mathrm{Poisson}(\\lambda)$.\n   - Compute the sample mean $\\bar{N} = \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_{t=1}^M N_t$.\n   - Set the energy series as $U_t^\\ast = a\\,(N_t - \\bar{N}) + c$, where $a$ and $c$ are constants specified per test case. This construction ensures a tunable linear correlation between $U_t^\\ast$ and $N_t$ while maintaining stationarity. Use $c=0$ for all cases.\n   - Use a fixed pseudorandom number generator seed for reproducibility as specified per case.\n2. From each generated trajectory, compute the differential isosteric heat of adsorption, denoted $q_{\\mathrm{st}}$, in $\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$ at the specified $T$. You must express $q_{\\mathrm{st}}$ in $\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$. Round each reported $q_{\\mathrm{st}}$ to two decimals.\n3. Compare the computed $q_{\\mathrm{st}}$ values to the provided calorimetric references by returning the absolute deviations in $\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, rounded to two decimals, and a boolean flag for each case indicating whether the deviation is less than or equal to $0.50\\ \\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n\nTest suite (three cases):\n- Case A (moderate physisorption at ambient temperature):\n  - Temperature: $T = 298\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n  - Poisson mean: $\\lambda = 15$\n  - Trajectory length: $M = 2000$\n  - Energy coupling: $a = -7.5$\n  - Constant offset: $c = 0$\n  - Random seed: $s = 1$\n  - Calorimetric reference: $q_{\\mathrm{st}}^{\\mathrm{(cal)}} = 21.06\\ \\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$\n- Case B (low loading):\n  - Temperature: $T = 350\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n  - Poisson mean: $\\lambda = 2$\n  - Trajectory length: $M = 4000$\n  - Energy coupling: $a = -4.0$\n  - Constant offset: $c = 0$\n  - Random seed: $s = 2$\n  - Calorimetric reference: $q_{\\mathrm{st}}^{\\mathrm{(cal)}} = 14.55\\ \\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$\n- Case C (weak adsorption at elevated temperature):\n  - Temperature: $T = 400\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n  - Poisson mean: $\\lambda = 50$\n  - Trajectory length: $M = 3000$\n  - Energy coupling: $a = 0.1$\n  - Constant offset: $c = 0$\n  - Random seed: $s = 3$\n  - Calorimetric reference: $q_{\\mathrm{st}}^{\\mathrm{(cal)}} = 2.99\\ \\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$\n\nImplementation details and requirements:\n- In all covariance and variance calculations, use ensemble (population) moments, that is, for two series $\\{X_t\\}, \\{Y_t\\}$ with sample means $\\bar{X}, \\bar{Y}$, use\n  $$\\mathrm{cov}(X,Y) = \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_{t=1}^M (X_t - \\bar{X})(Y_t - \\bar{Y}),\\quad \\mathrm{var}(X) = \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_{t=1}^M (X_t - \\bar{X})^2.$$\n- The final program must generate the data internally; no user input is allowed.\n- Final output format: Your program should produce a single line of output containing all results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets. The list must contain nine entries in this order: the three computed $q_{\\mathrm{st}}$ values for Cases A, B, C (in $\\mathrm{kJ}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, rounded to two decimals), followed by the three absolute deviations from the calorimetric references (rounded to two decimals), followed by the three boolean flags for the tolerance test. For example: \"[qA,qB,qC,dA,dB,dC,flagA,flagB,flagC]\".", "solution": "The problem statement has been critically validated and is deemed to be scientifically sound, self-contained, and well-posed. It presents a standard problem in statistical thermodynamics and its application in molecular simulation, which requires both a first-principles derivation and a numerical implementation based on that derivation.\n\nThe core task is to derive an expression for the differential isosteric heat of adsorption, $q_{\\mathrm{st}}$, using fluctuation formulas from the grand canonical ensemble, and then apply it to synthetic simulation data.\n\n**Derivation from First Principles**\n\nThe isosteric heat of adsorption, $q_{\\mathrm{st}}$, is defined by the Clausius-Clapeyron equation for an adsorption equilibrium at constant surface coverage, which is equivalent to a constant average number of adsorbed molecules, $\\langle N \\rangle$.\n$$ q_{\\mathrm{st}} = R T^2 \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\ln P}{\\partial T} \\right)_{\\langle N \\rangle} $$\nwhere $P$ is the pressure of the bulk gas phase in equilibrium with the adsorbed phase, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $R$ is the universal gas constant. Assuming the gas phase is ideal, its chemical potential $\\mu$ is related to pressure by $\\mu = \\mu^0(T) + k_B T \\ln(P/P^0)$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. From this, $\\ln P$ can be expressed in terms of $\\mu/T$. The derivative can be rewritten as:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\ln P}{\\partial T} \\right)_{\\langle N \\rangle} = \\frac{1}{k_B} \\left( \\frac{\\partial (\\mu/T)}{\\partial T} \\right)_{\\langle N \\rangle} - \\frac{1}{k_B} \\frac{d(\\mu^0/T)}{dT} $$\nFrom thermodynamics, for an ideal gas, $\\frac{d(\\mu^0/T)}{dT} = -h_g / T^2$, where $h_g$ is the molar enthalpy of a gas molecule. Thus,\n$$ q_{\\mathrm{st}} = N_A T^2 \\left( \\left( \\frac{\\partial (\\mu/T)}{\\partial T} \\right)_{\\langle N \\rangle} + \\frac{h_g}{T^2} \\right) = N_A h_g + N_A T^2 \\left( \\frac{\\partial (\\mu/T)}{\\partial T} \\right)_{\\langle N \\rangle} $$\nwhere $N_A$ is Avogadro's constant ($R=N_A k_B$).\n\nTo evaluate the derivative at constant $\\langle N \\rangle$, we use the triple product rule:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\partial (\\mu/T)}{\\partial T} \\right)_{\\langle N \\rangle} = - \\frac{(\\partial \\langle N \\rangle / \\partial T)_{\\mu/T}}{(\\partial \\langle N \\rangle / \\partial (\\mu/T))_T} $$\nThe average number of particles $\\langle N \\rangle$ is a function of the state variables $(\\mu, V, T)$. In the grand canonical ensemble, fluctuation-response theorems relate thermodynamic derivatives to correlations between fluctuating quantities. The relevant identities are:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\langle N \\rangle}{\\partial \\mu} \\right)_T = \\frac{1}{k_B T} (\\langle N^2 \\rangle - \\langle N \\rangle^2) = \\frac{\\mathrm{var}(N)}{k_B T} $$\n$$ \\mathrm{cov}(N, E) = \\langle NE \\rangle - \\langle N \\rangle \\langle E \\rangle = k_B T^2 \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\langle N \\rangle}{\\partial T} \\right)_{\\mu} + \\mu \\mathrm{var}(N) $$\nwhere $E$ is the total energy of the system ($E = U + K$, configurational + kinetic). Rearranging the covariance expression gives:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\langle N \\rangle}{\\partial T} \\right)_{\\mu} = \\frac{\\mathrm{cov}(N, E) - \\mu \\mathrm{var}(N)}{k_B T^2} $$\nWe can express the derivative $(\\partial \\langle N \\rangle / \\partial (\\mu/T))_T$ in terms of $(\\partial \\langle N \\rangle / \\partial \\mu)_T$:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\langle N \\rangle}{\\partial (\\mu/T)} \\right)_T = \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\langle N \\rangle}{\\partial \\mu} \\right)_T \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\mu}{\\partial (\\mu/T)} \\right)_T = \\frac{\\mathrm{var}(N)}{k_B T} \\cdot T = \\frac{\\mathrm{var}(N)}{k_B} $$\nThe derivative at constant $\\mu/T$ (or constant activity $z = e^{\\mu/k_B T}$) is:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\langle N \\rangle}{\\partial T} \\right)_{\\mu/T} = \\frac{\\mathrm{cov}(N,U)}{k_B T^2} $$\nThis relation directly involves the configurational energy $U$, which is what is typically computed in a GCMC simulation. Substituting these into the triple product rule yields:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\partial (\\mu/T)}{\\partial T} \\right)_{\\langle N \\rangle} = - \\frac{\\mathrm{cov}(N, U) / (k_B T^2)}{\\mathrm{var}(N) / k_B} = - \\frac{\\mathrm{cov}(N, U)}{T \\cdot \\mathrm{var}(N)} $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $q_{\\mathrm{st}}$:\n$$ q_{\\mathrm{st}} = N_A h_g + N_A T^2 \\left( - \\frac{\\mathrm{cov}(N, U)}{T \\cdot \\mathrm{var}(N)} \\right) = N_A h_g - N_A T \\frac{\\mathrm{cov}(N, U)}{\\mathrm{var}(N)} $$\nAn alternative and more common definition of isosteric heat is the difference between the molar enthalpy of the gas phase, $H_g = N_A h_g$, and the partial molar enthalpy of the adsorbed phase, $\\bar{H}_{ads}$:\n$$ q_{\\mathrm{st}} = H_g - \\bar{H}_{ads} = H_g - \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\langle H_{ads} \\rangle}{\\partial \\langle N \\rangle} \\right)_{T} $$\nFor a rigid adsorbent, the pressure-volume term for the adsorbed phase is negligible, so $\\langle H_{ads} \\rangle \\approx \\langle E_{ads} \\rangle = \\langle U \\rangle + \\langle K_{ads} \\rangle$, where $U$ is the configurational energy and $K_{ads}$ is the kinetic energy of adsorbed molecules. The partial derivative is:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\langle H_{ads} \\rangle}{\\partial \\langle N \\rangle} \\right)_{T} \\approx \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\langle U \\rangle}{\\partial \\langle N \\rangle} \\right)_{T} + \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\langle K_{ads} \\rangle}{\\partial \\langle N \\rangle} \\right)_{T} $$\nThe partial configurational energy is given by the fluctuation formula: $(\\partial \\langle U \\rangle / \\partial \\langle N \\rangle)_T = \\mathrm{cov}(N, U) / \\mathrm{var}(N)$. Assuming the average kinetic energy per particle is the same in the adsorbed phase and the gas phase, $\\langle K_{ads} \\rangle/\\langle N \\rangle = \\langle K_{gas} \\rangle = h_g - k_B T$. Then $(\\partial \\langle K_{ads} \\rangle / \\partial \\langle N \\rangle)_T = h_g - k_B T$.\n$$ q_{\\mathrm{st}} = N_A h_g - N_A \\left( \\frac{\\mathrm{cov}(N, U)}{\\mathrm{var}(N)} + h_g - k_B T \\right) = N_A k_B T - N_A \\frac{\\mathrm{cov}(N, U)}{\\mathrm{var}(N)} $$\nLetting $R = N_A k_B$, we arrive at the final expression:\n$$ q_{\\mathrm{st}} = RT - N_A \\frac{\\mathrm{cov}(N, U)}{\\mathrm{var}(N)} $$\nThe problem provides the configurational energy as a dimensionless time series $U_t^\\ast = U_t/(k_B T)$. We introduce this into our expression:\n$\\mathrm{cov}(N, U) = \\mathrm{cov}(N, U^\\ast k_B T) = k_B T \\cdot \\mathrm{cov}(N, U^\\ast)$.\n$$ q_{\\mathrm{st}} = RT - N_A \\frac{k_B T \\cdot \\mathrm{cov}(N, U^\\ast)}{\\mathrm{var}(N)} = RT - RT \\frac{\\mathrm{cov}(N, U^\\ast)}{\\mathrm{var}(N)} $$\n$$ q_{\\mathrm{st}} = RT \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\mathrm{cov}(N, U^\\ast)}{\\mathrm{var}(N)} \\right) $$\nThis is the expression to be implemented.\n\n**Implementation Strategy**\n\nThe program will implement this formula. For each test case, it will:\n1.  Generate synthetic time series for particle number, $\\{N_t\\}_{t=1}^M$, and dimensionless configurational energy, $\\{U_t^\\ast\\}_{t=1}^M$, according to the specified protocol. The protocol is $N_t \\sim \\mathrm{Poisson}(\\lambda)$ and $U_t^\\ast = a(N_t - \\bar{N})$, where $\\bar{N}$ is the sample mean of $\\{N_t\\}$.\n2.  Calculate the variance of $N_t$ and the covariance of $N_t$ and $U_t^\\ast$ using the population moment definitions ($\\frac{1}{M}\\sum(...)$).\n3.  Substitute these values into the derived formula to compute $q_{\\mathrm{st}}$.\n\nFor the specified data generation, where $U_t^\\ast = a(N_t - \\bar{N})$, the ratio of covariance to variance simplifies exactly:\n$$ \\mathrm{cov}(N, U^\\ast) = \\left\\langle (N-\\bar{N})(U^\\ast - \\bar{U}^\\ast) \\right\\rangle = \\left\\langle (N-\\bar{N})(a(N-\\bar{N}) - 0) \\right\\rangle = a \\left\\langle (N-\\bar{N})^2 \\right\\rangle = a \\cdot \\mathrm{var}(N) $$\nTherefore, $\\frac{\\mathrm{cov}(N, U^\\ast)}{\\mathrm{var}(N)} = a$. The isosteric heat simplifies to $q_{\\mathrm{st}} = RT(1-a)$. While this analytical result serves as a perfect check, the implementation will perform the full numerical calculation with the generated data as specified in the problem, thereby validating both the derivation and the ability to process time series data. The numerical computation will yield the exact analytical result due to the construction of the synthetic data. Finally, the computed $q_{\\mathrm{st}}$ will be compared to the reference value $q_{\\mathrm{st}}^{\\mathrm{(cal)}}$ to determine the absolute deviation and the boolean tolerance flag.", "answer": "```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives and implements a formula for the isosteric heat of adsorption\n    from synthetic GCMC simulation data.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Universal gas constant in kJ mol^-1 K^-1\n    R = 8.314462618e-3\n\n    # Test suite: (T, lambda, M, a, c, seed, q_st_cal)\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A\n        (298, 15, 2000, -7.5, 0, 1, 21.06),\n        # Case B\n        (350, 2, 4000, -4.0, 0, 2, 14.55),\n        # Case C\n        (400, 50, 3000, 0.1, 0, 3, 2.99),\n    ]\n\n    q_st_results = []\n    deviation_results = []\n    flag_results = []\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        T, lam, M, a, c, seed, q_st_cal = case\n\n        # 1.
