At equilibrium, there is no net flow of charge carriers, meaning the total current density for any given species is zero. The one-dimensional flux density $J$ for a charged species with concentration $c$ and charge $z q$ (where $z$ is the charge number, $+1$ for holes, $-1$ for electrons) is given by the Nernst–Planck equation, which combines drift and diffusion components:\n$$J = J_{\\text{drift}} + J_{\\text{diff}}$$\nThe drift flux density is driven by the electric field $E$ and is given by $J_{\\text{drift}} = c(zq)\\mu E$.

This asymmetry means that electrons are far more mobile and diffuse much faster than holes ($D_n \\gg D_p$).\nFor a **photoanode** (typically an n-type semiconductor), photogenerated holes are the minority carriers that must travel to the semiconductor-electrolyte interface to drive an oxidation reaction. The performance is limited by the transport of these slow holes. The hole diffusion length, $L_p = \\sqrt{D_p \\tau_p}$ (where $\\tau_p$ is minority carrier lifetime), is short due to the small value of $D_p$. To collect holes efficiently, they must be generated within or very near the space-charge region, where the strong electric field can assist their transport via drift. Holes generated deep in the bulk (at a distance greater than $L_p$ from the depletion region edge) are likely to recombine before being collected. Thus, an optimal photoanode made from this material must be very thin, on the order of the absorption depth or the sum of the depletion width $W$ and the short hole diffusion length $L_p$, whichever is more restrictive, to ensure that most holes are generated where they can be collected. This constraint can compromise light absorption.\nFor a **photocathode** (typically a p-type semiconductor), photogenerated electrons are the minority carriers that must travel to the surface to drive a reduction reaction. The performance is limited by electron transport. Due to the high electron mobility $\\mu_n$, the electron diffusion coefficient $D_n$ is large, leading to a long electron diffusion length, $L_n = \\sqrt{D_n \\tau_n}$. These fast-moving electrons can travel long distances before recombining. Therefore, electrons generated deep within the semiconductor bulk can still diffuse efficiently to the space-charge region and be swept to the surface reactive sites. This allows for the use of a thicker absorber layer, which enhances the absorption of incident photons and improves the overall quantum efficiency, especially for weakly absorbed, near-bandgap light.\nIn conclusion, the pronounced transport asymmetry ($\\mu_n \\gg \\mu_p$) makes this material intrinsically far better suited for application as a photocathode, where the highly mobile electrons are the minority carriers.
