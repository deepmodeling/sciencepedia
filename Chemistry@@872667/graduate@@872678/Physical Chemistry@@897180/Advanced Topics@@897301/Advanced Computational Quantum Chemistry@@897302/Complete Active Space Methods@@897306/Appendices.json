The fragment contributes $2$ $\\pi$ electrons to these frontier levels. You wish to compute a singlet potential energy curve using a multiconfigurational ansatz. \n\nStarting from the time-independent electronic Schrödinger equation and the variational principle, a single-determinant Hartree–Fock description minimizes the energy within the space of Slater determinants built from a single set of spin orbitals, but it fails when two or more determinants become quasi-degenerate, producing large so-called static (nondynamic) correlation. A Complete Active Space Self-Consistent Field (CASSCF) wave function is defined by selecting an active orbital subset in which the wave function is a Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) expansion over all occupations consistent with a fixed number of active electrons, while all remaining orbitals are kept either doubly occupied (inactive) or unoccupied (secondary). In the present scenario, the static correlation arises from the near-degeneracy of $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$ together with fluctuations in their electron occupations.\n\nWhich choice correctly identifies the minimal active space that can capture this static correlation for the singlet state and, at the same time, correctly enumerates the corresponding many-electron occupation patterns that must be included by FCI within that active space? Select the single best option.\n\nA. Choose a Complete Active Space with $2$ electrons in $2$ spatial orbitals, $\\text{CAS}(2,2)$, taking $\\\\{\\phi_1,\\phi_2\\\\}$ as active. Include all occupations compatible with $N=2$ within the active space, namely the two closed-shell patterns $(2,0)$ and $(0,2)$ and the open-shell pattern $(1,1)$ coupled to total spin $S=0$ for the singlet. This captures near-degeneracy by allowing the electrons to delocalize over both frontier orbitals.\n\nB. Choose $\\text{CAS}(2,1)$ with only $\\phi_1$ active and $\\phi_2$ kept inactive as a virtual orbital. Permit only the $(2)$ closed-shell occupation in the active space. Orbital rotations within CASSCF will mix in antibonding character sufficiently to describe the near-degeneracy without needing explicit multi-occupancy patterns.\n\nC. Choose $\\text{CAS}(2,4)$ containing $\\\\{\\phi_1,\\phi_2\\\\}$ and two higher $\\pi^\\ast$ orbitals to recover dynamic correlation. Enumerate patterns including $(2,0,0,0)$, $(1,1,0,0)$, $(0,2,0,0)$ and also single-excitation patterns such as $(1,0,1,0)$ and $(1,0,0,1)$ into the additional active orbitals; this enlargement is the minimal way to account for the static correlation.\n\nD. Choose $\\text{CAS}(2,2)$ on $\\\\{\\phi_1,\\phi_2\\\\}$ but, to avoid spin contamination, exclude the $(1,1)$ pattern and retain only the two even-electron closed-shell patterns $(2,0)$ and $(0,2)$, since these alone are pure singlets and therefore sufficient for the singlet state description.", "solution": "We begin from the time-independent electronic Schrödinger equation $\\hat{H}\\Psi = E\\Psi$ and the Rayleigh–Ritz variational principle, which states that for any normalized trial wave function $\\Phi$, the expectation value $E[\\Phi] = \\langle \\Phi | \\hat{H} | \\Phi \\rangle$ is an upper bound to the exact ground-state energy. The Hartree–Fock method restricts $\\Phi$ to a single Slater determinant built from one set of spin orbitals, which is typically adequate when a single occupation pattern dominates. However, when two spatial orbitals become nearly degenerate and there are $2$ electrons that can occupy them in multiple nearly isoenergetic ways, the single-determinant ansatz fails to capture static correlation: multiple determinants must be mixed with comparable weight.\n\nIn a Complete Active Space Self-Consistent Field (CASSCF) calculation, one chooses an active space of $M$ spatial orbitals and $N$ active electrons. The CASSCF wave function is an FCI expansion over all determinants (or spin-adapted configuration state functions) formed by distributing the $N$ active electrons among the $M$ active orbitals, while orbitals outside the active space are kept either doubly occupied (inactive) or unoccupied (secondary). The orbitals and the expansion coefficients are optimized variationally.\n\nIn the scenario described, there are $2$ frontier $\\pi$ orbitals $\\\\{\\phi_1,\\phi_2\\\\}$ that are nearly degenerate and well separated from all others, and there are $2$ $\\pi$ electrons occupying these frontier levels. The essential static correlation arises from the competition among three qualitatively distinct occupation patterns: both electrons in $\\phi_1$ (denoted $(2,0)$), one electron in each orbital $(1,1)$, and both electrons in $\\phi_2$ $(0,2)$. When $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$ are close in energy, these patterns become quasi-degenerate. Therefore, the minimal active space that can describe the singlet state must contain both frontier orbitals and both electrons, that is $\\text{CAS}(2,2)$ on $\\\\{\\phi_1,\\phi_2\\\\}$.\n\nWithin $\\text{CAS}(2,2)$, the FCI expansion includes all determinants formed from $N=2$ electrons in $M=2$ spatial orbitals, i.e., in $2M=4$ spin orbitals. The number of Slater determinants is $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$. When spin-adapted to total spin $S=0$ for the singlet state, the relevant configuration state functions (CSFs) are:\n- one CSF corresponding to the closed-shell $(2,0)$ pattern (both electrons paired in $\\phi_1$),\n- one CSF corresponding to the closed-shell $(0,2)$ pattern (both electrons paired in $\\phi_2$),\n- one open-shell singlet CSF built from the $(1,1)$ occupation with opposite spins coupled to $S=0$.\n\nThese three CSFs span the singlet subspace for $2$ electrons in $2$ orbitals. If one also wished to describe the triplet, there would be a single open-shell triplet CSF from $(1,1)$ (with three $M_S$ components), but for a singlet calculation the three singlet CSFs listed above are the complete set.\n\nWe now evaluate each option:\n\nA. This option selects $\\text{CAS}(2,2)$ with the two frontier orbitals active and correctly states that all occupations compatible with $N=2$ must be included. It enumerates the two closed-shell patterns $(2,0)$ and $(0,2)$ and the open-shell pattern $(1,1)$ coupled to total spin $S=0$ for the singlet. This is exactly the minimal active space and the correct set of singlet occupation patterns required to capture the static correlation arising from the near-degeneracy of $\\phi_1$ and $\\phi_2$. Verdict — Correct.\n\nB. This option proposes $\\text{CAS}(2,1)$ with only one active orbital. With $2$ electrons in $1$ spatial orbital, the only allowed occupation is $(2)$, which reduces to a single closed-shell determinant. Such an active space cannot represent configurations where one electron occupies $\\phi_2$ or where the electrons are distributed $(1,1)$. Orbital rotations cannot substitute for missing configurations when two orbitals are genuinely near-degenerate; explicit multi-occupancy patterns are required. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nC. This option enlarges to $\\text{CAS}(2,4)$ by adding two higher $\\pi^\\ast$ orbitals. While $\\text{CAS}(2,4)$ is a legitimate larger active space and can capture additional effects, it is not minimal for the stated purpose of describing the static correlation between the two frontier orbitals that are well separated from the rest. Furthermore, the rationale given emphasizes recovery of dynamic correlation, which is not the role of a minimal active space, and conflates necessity with sufficiency. The minimal adequate choice is $\\text{CAS}(2,2)$ on $\\\\{\\phi_1,\\phi_2\\\\}$. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nD. This option chooses $\\text{CAS}(2,2)$ but excludes the $(1,1)$ pattern on the grounds of avoiding spin contamination. The $(1,1)$ open-shell occupation is essential for both singlet and triplet descriptions when orbitals are near-degenerate. In a spin-adapted basis, the open-shell singlet CSF built from $(1,1)$ is an exact spin eigenfunction and does not introduce spin contamination. Excluding it removes the key covalent contribution and yields an incomplete description of static correlation. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2631281"}, {"introduction": "In practice, selecting the perfect active space on the first attempt is rare; the process is often one of iterative refinement.

The sum is $1.80 + 1.20 + 1.10 + 0.90 + 0.55 + 0.45 = 6.00$, consistent with $6$ active electrons.\n5.  **NOONs** at iteration $k=20$: $\\{1.98, 1.90, 1.05, 0.95, 0.12, 0.02\\}$. The sum of these numbers is $1.98 + 1.90 + 1.05 + 0.95 + 0.12 + 0.02 = 6.02$. Strictly, the sum of NOONs in the active space must equal the number of active electrons, which is $6$. The value $6.02$ represents a minor inconsistency, likely due to rounding in the problem statement. It does not alter the qualitative interpretation.\n6.  **Orbital Gradient Observation**: At convergence, the largest orbital-rotation gradients couple an active orbital with an external (virtual) $\\pi$-type orbital.\n7.  **Principle (i)**: Definition of natural orbitals and NOONs, with eigenvalues $n_i$ satisfying $0 \\le n_i \\le 2$.\n8.  **Principle (ii)**: Interpretation of NOONs: $n_i$ values far from $0$ and $2$ indicate strong static correlation. Values near $2$ indicate inactive (doubly occupied) character, and values near $0$ indicate secondary (unoccupied) character.\n9.  **Principle (iii)**: CASSCF is a variational method, minimizing energy with respect to both CI coefficients and orbital rotations.\n\n**Validation Verdict:**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. The minor numerical inconsistency in the sum of converged NOONs is noted but does not invalidate the problem, as the qualitative behavior is the focus of the question. The problem is **valid**.\n\n**Solution Derivation:**\nThe provided information allows for a clear diagnosis of the state of the CASSCF calculation.\n\n1.  **Analysis of NOONs**: According to principle (ii), the converged NOONs $\\{1.98, 1.90, 1.05, 0.95, 0.12, 0.02\\}$ reveal an unbalanced active space.\n    *   Two orbitals have NOONs $1.98$ and $1.90$, which are very close to the maximum value of $2$. These orbitals are behaving as nearly inactive (doubly occupied) and contribute little to the static correlation.\n    *   Two orbitals have NOONs $1.05$ and $0.95$. These are far from $0$ and $2$, indicating that these orbitals are strongly statically correlated and form the core of the multireference character.\n    *   Two orbitals have NOONs $0.12$ and $0.02$, which are very close to $0$. These orbitals are behaving as nearly secondary (unoccupied/virtual).\n    *   The orbital optimization, in its search for the lowest energy, has partitioned the initial active space into a set of core correlated orbitals and a set of orbitals that are essentially inactive or virtual. This means the initial choice of $\\text{CAS}(6,6)$ was not optimal for describing the static correlation.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Orbital Gradients**: According to principle (iii), the CASSCF energy is minimized with respect to orbital rotations. A converged calculation should have near-zero gradients for all orbital rotations. The observation of a large gradient for rotation between an active and an external orbital indicates that the energy is not minimized with respect to this mixing. The variational principle is signaling that the total energy can be lowered by including character from this external orbital into the active space. This means an important orbital for describing the system's electronic structure is currently outside the chosen active space.\n\n3.  **Combined Diagnosis**: The two pieces of evidence are complementary. The NOONs show that some orbitals *inside* the active space are not strongly correlated. The orbital gradients show that an orbital *outside* the active space *is* important. The correct interpretation is that the initial $\\text{CAS}(6,6)$ active space is suboptimal. The CASSCF procedure is attempting to correct this by pushing some orbitals out (to NOONs of $\\approx 2$ and $\\approx 0$) and indicating that another orbital should be brought in. The fundamental problem is with the definition of the active space itself.\n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n\n**A. The active space is unbalanced: at least one included active orbital is effectively inactive with $n_i \\to 2$ and another is effectively secondary with $n_i \\to 0$. Remedy by enlarging the active space to include the strongly coupled external orbital and, if desired, by removing orbitals that consistently drift to the extremes.**\nThis diagnosis is entirely correct. The NOONs ($1.98$ and $0.02$) confirm the presence of effectively inactive and secondary orbitals. The remedy—including the important external orbital (as indicated by the gradient) and removing the drifting orbitals—is the standard and correct procedure for refining a sub-optimal active space.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**B. The problem is a lack of dynamic correlation only. Remedy by proceeding to Complete Active Space Second-Order Perturbation Theory (CASPT2) without changing the active space.**\nThis is incorrect. The issues identified—NOONs drifting to integer values and large orbital gradients—are characteristic of a poor description of *static* correlation by the CASSCF reference wavefunction. CASPT2 is a method to add dynamic correlation on top of a CASSCF reference. Applying it to a flawed reference wavefunction is not a valid procedure and will yield unreliable results.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**C. The issue is state-specific bias. Remedy by switching to State-Averaged Complete Active Space Self-Consistent Field (SA-CASSCF) over multiple roots while keeping the same active space.**\nThis is not the primary issue. State-averaging is used to find a balanced orbital set for multiple electronic states. The evidence here points to a poorly chosen set of orbitals for describing even a single state. Switching to SA-CASSCF would not fix the fundamental problem that an important orbital is missing from the space and unimportant ones are included.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. The orbital optimization is over-rotating. Remedy by increasing the level shift or otherwise freezing rotations between active and external orbitals to suppress the drift of NOONs.**\nThis is a profound misunderstanding of the method. The large rotations and NOON drift are not numerical artifacts to be suppressed; they are diagnostic signals from the variational principle telling us how to improve the wavefunction. Using a level shift or freezing rotations would artificially prevent the optimization from finding the correct, lower-energy solution and would result in a converged wavefunction of poorer quality. One must follow the direction the gradient indicates, not suppress it.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E. The active space assignment is suboptimal. Remedy by reassigning the nearly doubly occupied orbital to the inactive space and the nearly empty orbital to the secondary space, while bringing in the strongly interacting external $\\pi$ orbital(s), potentially moving to $\\text{CAS}(8,8)$ or using a Restricted Active Space Self-Consistent Field (RASSCF) partition to target the statically correlated subset.**\nThis is an excellent and detailed diagnosis and remedy. The term \"suboptimal assignment\" is precise. The remedy correctly describes the process of orbital reassignment (swapping unimportant ones out and important ones in). It also suggests concrete and appropriate advanced strategies, such as expanding the space to $\\text{CAS}(8,8)$ if a new pair of correlated orbitals is identified, or using the more flexible RASSCF method to partition the orbitals. This option demonstrates a high level of understanding.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**F. The behavior is due to numerical noise. Remedy by tightening integral thresholds (for example, to $10^{-12}$) while keeping the same active space.**\nThe observed behavior is systematic and has a clear physical interpretation based on the principles of CASSCF. It is not random noise. Tightening computational thresholds will not fix a fundamental error in the active space model; it would just converge more tightly to the same physically incorrect description.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**G. The initial guess was too single-reference-like. Remedy by initializing with natural orbitals from a second-order Møller–Plesset (MP2) calculation on the closed-shell reference and keeping the same active space.**\nThe initial guess affects the convergence path, but not the final variationally optimized solution for a given active space. The calculation has proceeded for $20$ iterations and is showing the properties of the converged (or near-converged) state. The problem is with the definition of the active space itself, not the starting point of the optimization. Changing the initial guess will not add a missing orbital to the active space.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nBoth options A and E provide a correct diagnosis and remedy. Option E is more specific and comprehensive than option A, but both are fundamentally correct.

Therefore, Active Space A provides a more balanced description.\n\nIt is worth noting that the smaller leading weights in Active Space B ($0.6241$ and $0.4900$) indicate that both wave functions have more significant multireference character compared to Active Space A ($0.8836$ and $0.8464$). Including the $\\sigma$ and $\\sigma^\\ast$ orbitals allows for the description of $\\sigma \\to \\sigma^\\ast$ correlation, which is captured by the SA-CASSCF orbital optimization and subsequent CI expansion. However, this additional correlation is incorporated in an uneven manner, making the $S_0$ state appear \"more single-reference\" (leading weight of $\\approx 62\\%$) than the $S_1$ state (leading weight of $\\approx 49\\%$). This creates an imbalance. In contrast, the minimal $\\mathrm{CAS}(2,2)$ space treats both states as being strongly, and similarly, dominated by a single CSF.\n\nNow we evaluate the provided options.\n\n**Option A: Active Space A $\\mathrm{CAS}(2,2)$ yields a more balanced description across $S_0$ and $S_1$.**\nThis conclusion is directly supported by our calculations. The pair of leading weights for Active Space A, ($0.8836$, $0.8464$), is significantly more similar than the pair for Active Space B, ($0.6241$, $0.4900$).\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Option B: Active Space B $\\mathrm{CAS}(4,4)$ yields a more balanced description across $S_0$ and $S_1$.**\nThis statement is contradicted by our quantitative analysis. The leading weights in Active Space B are more dissimilar than in Active Space A.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option C: Both active spaces are equally balanced because state averaging enforces equal treatment of states by construction.**\nThis reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the SA-CASSCF method. State averaging creates a single, compromised set of molecular orbitals by minimizing an average energy functional. It does not by any means guarantee that the resulting multireference CI wave functions for each individual state will possess a similar character or structure. The provided data demonstrates this fact empirically.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option D: Neither active space is balanced; even larger active spaces are required to achieve balance for these two states.**\nThe question asks for a relative comparison: which space is *more* balanced. While it may be true in an absolute sense that a perfect description requires an even larger active space to capture all relevant correlation effects in a balanced way, this option fails to answer the question posed. Between the two choices, Active Space A is demonstrably *more* balanced according to the stated criterion.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2631282"}]}
