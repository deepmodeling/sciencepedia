The problem is self-contained and free of contradictions, scientific inaccuracies, or ambiguities.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A full solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the Radial Kohn–Sham Equations**\n\nThe time-independent Kohn–Sham equation in atomic units is given by:\n$$\n\\left[ -\\dfrac{1}{2}\\nabla^2 + v_{\\text{eff}}(\\mathbf{r}) \\right] \\psi_i(\\mathbf{r}) = \\varepsilon_i \\psi_i(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\nThe effective potential, $v_{\\text{eff}}(\\mathbf{r})$, is the sum of the external potential, $v_{\\text{ext}}(\\mathbf{r})$, the classical electrostatic (Hartree) potential, $v_{H}(\\mathbf{r})$, and the exchange–correlation potential, $v_{xc}(\\mathbf{r})$:\n$$\nv_{\\text{eff}}(\\mathbf{r}) = v_{\\text{ext}}(\\mathbf{r}) + v_{H}(\\mathbf{r}) + v_{xc}(\\mathbf{r})\n$$\nThe problem states that the external potential is spherically symmetric, $v_{\\text{ext}}(\\mathbf{r}) = v_{\\text{ext}}(r)$. For a closed-shell system, the electron density, $n(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_i f_i |\\psi_i(\\mathbf{r})|^2$ (where $f_i$ are occupation numbers), is also spherically symmetric, $n(\\mathbf{r}) = n(r)$. Consequently, the Hartree and exchange–correlation potentials are also spherically symmetric, so $v_{\\text{eff}}(\\mathbf{r}) = v_{\\text{eff}}(r)$.\n\nGiven the spherical symmetry of the potential, the Kohn–Sham orbitals, $\\psi_i(\\mathbf{r})$, can be separated into a radial part, $R_{n\\ell}(r)$, and an angular part, the spherical harmonics $Y_{\\ell m}(\\theta, \\phi)$:\n$$\n\\psi_{n\\ell m}(\\mathbf{r}) = R_{n\\ell}(r) Y_{\\ell m}(\\theta, \\phi)\n$$\nThe Laplacian operator in spherical coordinates is $\\nabla^2 = \\dfrac{1}{r^2}\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\left(r^2 \\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\right) - \\dfrac{\\hat{L}^2}{r^2}$, where $\\hat{L}^2$ is the squared angular momentum operator. Applying this to $\\psi_{n\\ell m}$ yields:\n$$\n\\nabla^2 \\psi_{n\\ell m}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\left[ \\dfrac{1}{r^2}\\dfrac{d}{dr}\\left(r^2 \\dfrac{d R_{n\\ell}}{dr}\\right) - \\dfrac{\\ell(\\ell+1)}{r^2} R_{n\\ell}(r) \\right] Y_{\\ell m}(\\theta, \\phi)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the Kohn–Sham equation and canceling the common factor $Y_{\\ell m}(\\theta, \\phi)$ gives the radial equation for $R_{n\\ell}(r)$:\n$$\n\\left[ -\\dfrac{1}{2}\\dfrac{1}{r^2}\\dfrac{d}{dr}\\left(r^2 \\dfrac{d}{dr}\\right) + \\dfrac{\\ell(\\ell+1)}{2r^2} + v_{\\text{eff}}(r) \\right] R_{n\\ell}(r) = \\varepsilon_{n\\ell} R_{n\\ell}(r)\n$$\nIt is conventional to simplify this equation by substituting $u_{n\\ell}(r) = r R_{n\\ell}(r)$. The radial kinetic energy term transforms as:\n$$\n\\dfrac{1}{r^2}\\dfrac{d}{dr}\\left(r^2 \\dfrac{d R_{n\\ell}}{dr}\\right) = \\dfrac{1}{r^2}\\dfrac{d}{dr}\\left(r^2 \\dfrac{d}{dr}\\left(\\dfrac{u_{n\\ell}}{r}\\right)\\right) = \\dfrac{1}{r} \\dfrac{d^2 u_{n\\ell}}{dr^2}\n$$\nThe radial equation for $R_{n\\ell}(r)$ becomes:\n$$\n-\\dfrac{1}{2r} \\dfrac{d^2 u_{n\\ell}}{dr^2} + \\left[ \\dfrac{\\ell(\\ell+1)}{2r^2} + v_{\\text{eff}}(r) \\right] \\dfrac{u_{n\\ell}(r)}{r} = \\varepsilon_{n\\ell} \\dfrac{u_{n\\ell}(r)}{r}\n$$\nMultiplying by $r$ gives the final radial equation for $u_{n\\ell}(r)$:\n$$\n\\left[ -\\dfrac{1}{2}\\dfrac{d^2}{dr^2} + \\dfrac{\\ell(\\ell+1)}{2r^2} + v_{\\text{ext}}(r) + v_{H}(r) + v_{xc}(r) \\right] u_{n\\ell}(r) = \\varepsilon_{n\\ell} u_{n\\ell}(r)\n$$\nThis equation correctly includes the radial kinetic energy, the centrifugal potential, and the total effective potential.\n\nThe electron density $n(r)$ for a system of filled subshells is obtained by summing the contributions from all occupied orbitals. For a subshell with quantum numbers $(n, \\ell)$, there are $2\\ell+1$ degenerate spatial orbitals, each occupied by $2$ electrons (for a closed-shell system). Summing over the magnetic quantum number $m$ gives: $\\sum_{m=-\\ell}^{\\ell} |Y_{\\ell m}(\\theta, \\phi)|^2 = \\dfrac{2\\ell+1}{4\\pi}$. The density is then:\n$$\nn(r) = \\sum_{n,\\ell} f_{n\\ell} \\sum_{m=-\\ell}^{\\ell} |R_{n\\ell}(r) Y_{\\ell m}(\\theta,\\phi)|^2 = \\sum_{n,\\ell} f_{n\\ell} |R_{n\\ell}(r)|^2 \\dfrac{2\\ell+1}{4\\pi}\n$$\nwhere $f_{n\\ell}$ is the occupation of each spin-orbital in the $(n,\\ell)$ shell (e.g., $f_{n\\ell}=2$ for a filled shell). Substituting $R_{n\\ell}(r) = u_{n\\ell}(r)/r$:\n$$\nn(r) = \\sum_{n,\\ell} f_{n\\ell} \\dfrac{2\\ell+1}{4\\pi} \\dfrac{|u_{n\\ell}(r)|^2}{r^2}\n$$\nThis expression is standard, though convention for $f_{n\\ell}$ can vary. The form given in option A is correct under the standard interpretation of $f_{n\\ell}$ being occupancy per spin-orbital.\n\nThe Hartree potential $v_{H}(r)$ for a spherically symmetric charge density $n(r')$ is found by solving Poisson's equation, which gives:\n$$\nv_{H}(r) = \\int \\dfrac{n(\\mathbf{r}')}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'|} \\, d^3r' = 4\\pi \\left[ \\dfrac{1}{r} \\int_0^r n(r') r'^2 dr' + \\int_r^\\infty n(r') r' dr' \\right]\n$$\nThis is the potential at distance $r$ due to a spherical shell of charge inside $r$ and outside $r$, a direct result from Gauss's law in electrostatics.\n\nFinally, the Local Density Approximation (LDA) for the exchange-correlation energy is:\n$$\nE_{xc}^{\\text{LDA}}[n] = \\int n(\\mathbf{r}) \\varepsilon_{xc}^{\\text{HEG}}(n(\\mathbf{r})) \\, d^3\\mathbf{r}\n$$\nwhere $\\varepsilon_{xc}^{\\text{HEG}}(n)$ is the exchange-correlation energy per particle of a homogeneous electron gas (HEG) of density $n$. The corresponding potential is the functional derivative:\n$$\nv_{xc}^{\\text{LDA}}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\dfrac{\\delta E_{xc}^{\\text{LDA}}[n]}{\\delta n(\\mathbf{r})} = \\dfrac{d}{dn} \\left[ n \\, \\varepsilon_{xc}^{\\text{HEG}}(n) \\right] \\bigg|_{n=n(\\mathbf{r})}\n$$\nFor a spherically symmetric system, $v_{xc}^{\\text{LDA}}(\\mathbf{r}) = v_{xc}^{\\text{LDA}}(n(r))$. The potential at point $r$ depends only on the value of the electron density at that same point $r$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A.

The Hartree potential $v_H(r)$ is incorrectly omitted, and the centrifugal term has the wrong radial dependence, $\\dfrac{1}{r}$ instead of the correct $\\dfrac{1}{r^2}$.\n-   The statement that in LDA \"the Hartree potential is replaced by a purely local function of the density... while $v_{xc}(r)$ remains exact\" is factually incorrect.

This equation is missing the repulsive centrifugal potential term, $\\dfrac{\\ell(\\ell+1)}{2r^2}$, which is essential for any state with non-zero angular momentum ($\\ell  0$).\n-   The expression for the LDA potential is given as depending on both the density $n$ and its gradient $|\\nabla n|$. This is the definition of a Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA), not the Local Density Approximation (LDA).

The radial Kohn–Sham equations for $u_{n\\ell}(r)$ read...**\n-   The statement claims \"the centrifugal term is absent because of spherical symmetry\". This is fundamentally false. The separation of variables in a spherically symmetric potential is what *gives rise* to the centrifugal term $\\dfrac{\\ell(\\ell+1)}{2r^2}$. Omitting it is a grave error.\n-   The equation includes a \"Fock exchange\" term, $v_{x}^{\\text{Fock}}$, which belongs to Hartree-Fock theory, not standard Kohn-Sham DFT. While hybrid functionals mix Fock exchange into DFT, this problem concerns the basic KS-DFT framework and LDA. Furthermore, the Fock operator is non-local and cannot be represented by a simple multiplicative potential $v(r)$.\n-   The proposed LDA replacement, $v_{x}^{\\text{LDA}}(r)=\\beta/r$, is incorrect.

Note that in $s \\ll 1$ regions both PBE and BLYP reduce toward LDA and largely cancel in the difference, while in $s \\gg 1$ regions the Becke $88$ exchange enhancement in BLYP exceeds PBE, making $E_{\\mathrm{x}}^{\\mathrm{BLYP}}$ more negative than $E_{\\mathrm{x}}^{\\mathrm{PBE}}$ there. Since exchange dominates correlation in the tails, $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{xc}}(R)$ becomes more negative as $R$ increases (fragments stabilized more by BLYP), which reduces binding and shifts the minimum to larger $R$. Therefore, BLYP yields longer $R_e$ than PBE.\n\nB. Focus on the core region alone, where $s(\\mathbf{r}) \\ll 1$, because it contains most of the electron density. Since both functionals recover LDA there, $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{xc}}(R)$ is negligible at all $R$, so PBE and BLYP predict essentially identical $R_e$.\n\nC. Emphasize that PBE has a larger exchange enhancement factor than Becke $88$ in the $s \\gg 1$ regions, which destabilizes the separated atoms relative to the molecule and thus increases binding. Therefore, PBE should give longer $R_e$ than BLYP.\n\nD. Conclude that without fully self-consistent solutions for both functionals, no qualitative prediction is possible, because the dependence of $E_{\\mathrm{xc}}[n]$ on $n(\\mathbf{r})$ and $\\nabla n(\\mathbf{r})$ is too nonlocal to be inferred from the reduced gradient $s(\\mathbf{r})$ and the model density alone.", "solution": "The problem statement is a valid exercise in conceptual density functional theory. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It provides a simplified but physically meaningful model and a set of established qualitative facts about common exchange-correlation functionals, which are sufficient to deduce the required trend without recourse to a full numerical calculation. All elements of the problem are standard in the teaching and understanding of computational chemistry and physics.\n\nThe task is to analyze the difference in exchange-correlation energy, $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{xc}}(R) \\equiv E_{\\mathrm{xc}}^{\\mathrm{BLYP}}[n_R] - E_{\\mathrm{xc}}^{\\mathrm{PBE}}[n_R]$, for a model diatomic molecule and predict the resulting trend in the equilibrium bond length, $R_e$. The analysis will proceed by partitioning space according to the reduced density gradient, $s(\\mathbf{r})$.\n\nThe reduced gradient is defined as $s(\\mathbf{r}) = \\frac{|\\nabla n(\\mathbf{r})|}{2 k_F(n(\\mathbf{r})) \\, n(\\mathbf{r})}$, with $k_F(n) = (3\\pi^2 n)^{1/3}$. The behavior of $s(\\mathbf{r})$ across the molecule, using the given model density $n_R(\\mathbf{r})$, can be qualitatively assessed:\n1.  **Core regions**: Near the nuclei, the electron density $n_R(\\mathbf{r})$ is high and varies relatively slowly. This corresponds to the slowly varying limit, $s(\\mathbf{r}) \\ll 1$.\n2.  **Bonding region**: In the region between the nuclei, the gradient is small (zero at the bond midpoint by symmetry) and the density is reasonably large due to overlap. This region is characterized by small-to-intermediate values of $s(\\mathbf{r})$.\n3.  **Tail regions**: Far from the molecule, the density $n_R(\\mathbf{r})$ decays exponentially, $n \\propto e^{-\\alpha r}$. The gradient is $|\\nabla n| \\propto \\alpha e^{-\\alpha r} = \\alpha n$. The reduced gradient behaves as $s \\propto \\frac{\\alpha n}{n^{1/3} n} = \\alpha n^{-1/3}$. As the density $n \\to 0$ in the tails, the reduced gradient diverges, $s \\to \\infty$. These are low-density, large-gradient regions where $s(\\mathbf{r}) \\gg 1$.\n\nThe exchange-correlation energy difference $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{xc}}(R)$ is an integral over all space:\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{xc}}(R) = \\int \\left( e_{\\mathrm{xc}}^{\\mathrm{BLYP}}(n_R, \\nabla n_R) - e_{\\mathrm{xc}}^{\\mathrm{PBE}}(n_R, \\nabla n_R) \\right) \\, d\\mathbf{r} $$\nWe analyze the integrand in the different spatial regions identified above.\n\n*   In regions where $s(\\mathbf{r}) \\ll 1$ (cores, parts of the bond), fact (i) states that both GGA functionals, BLYP and PBE, recover the LDA limit. Thus, $e_{\\mathrm{xc}}^{\\mathrm{BLYP}} \\approx e_{\\mathrm{xc}}^{\\mathrm{PBE}} \\approx e_{\\mathrm{xc}}^{\\mathrm{LDA}}$. The contribution to the integrand is nearly zero, and these regions do not contribute significantly to $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{xc}}(R)$.\n\n*   In regions where $s(\\mathbf{r}) \\gg 1$ (tails), fact (iii) states that exchange energy dominates correlation energy in magnitude. Therefore, we can approximate $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{xc}}(R)$ by considering only the exchange part, $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{x}}(R)$. The GGA exchange energy can be written in terms of an enhancement factor $F_{\\mathrm{x}}(s)$ over the LDA exchange energy density, $e_{\\mathrm{x}}^{\\mathrm{LDA}}(n)$, which is always negative. Fact (ii) states that for $s \\gg 1$, the Becke $88$ enhancement factor used in BLYP is larger than that of PBE: $F_{\\mathrm{x}}^{\\mathrm{B88}}(s)  F_{\\mathrm{x}}^{\\mathrm{PBE}}(s)$. Since $e_{\\mathrm{x}}^{\\mathrm{LDA}}(n)  0$, this implies that the BLYP exchange energy density is more negative than that of PBE in these regions: $e_{\\mathrm{x}}^{\\mathrm{BLYP}}  e_{\\mathrm{x}}^{\\mathrm{PBE}}$. Consequently, the integrand is negative in the tail regions, and these regions provide a negative contribution to $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{xc}}(R)$.\n\nCombining these points, the overall sign of $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{xc}}(R)$ is determined by the tail regions, so $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{xc}}(R)  0$.\n\nNext, we consider the dependence on the internuclear distance $R$. Fact (iv) states that as $R$ increases, the molecule dissociates, and the volume of space dominated by atomic tails (where $s \\gg 1$) grows. The contribution from these regions to $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{xc}}(R)$ is negative, so as their volume increases, $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{xc}}(R)$ becomes more negative. This means BLYP stabilizes the separated atomic fragments more effectively than PBE does. The function $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{xc}}(R)$ is therefore a decreasing function of $R$ for large $R$.\n\nFinally, we determine the effect on the equilibrium bond length $R_e$. The total potential energy curve $U(R)$ for the molecule is the sum of the electronic energy and the nuclear-nuclear repulsion $V_{nn}(R)$. Within the non-self-consistent model, the BLYP and PBE potential curves are related by $U^{\\mathrm{BLYP}}(R) = U^{\\mathrm{PBE}}(R) + \\Delta E_{\\mathrm{xc}}(R)$. The equilibrium bond length is found where the net force on the nuclei is zero, which corresponds to the minimum of the potential energy curve, i.e., where the derivative is zero. Let us evaluate the derivative of the BLYP potential at the PBE equilibrium bond length, $R_e^{\\mathrm{PBE}}$:\n$$ \\frac{dU^{\\mathrm{BLYP}}}{dR} \\bigg|_{R=R_e^{\\mathrm{PBE}}} = \\frac{dU^{\\mathrm{PBE}}}{dR} \\bigg|_{R=R_e^{\\mathrm{PBE}}} + \\frac{d(\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{xc}})}{dR} \\bigg|_{R=R_e^{\\mathrm{PBE}}} $$\nBy definition of $R_e^{\\mathrm{PBE}}$, the first term is zero. We established that $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{xc}}(R)$ is a decreasing function of $R$, so its derivative is negative.\n$$ \\frac{dU^{\\mathrm{BLYP}}}{dR} \\bigg|_{R=R_e^{\\mathrm{PBE}}}  0 $$\nA negative slope on the potential energy curve at $R=R_e^{\\mathrm{PBE}}$ means that this point lies to the left of the BLYP minimum. To reach the BLYP minimum (where the slope is zero), one must move to a larger value of $R$. Therefore, the equilibrium bond length predicted by BLYP is longer than that predicted by PBE: $R_e^{\\mathrm{BLYP}}  R_e^{\\mathrm{PBE}}$.\nA weaker binding (as BLYP stabilizes the dissociated state more) is consistent with a longer, softer bond.\n\nNow we evaluate each option:\n\n**A.** This option correctly partitions space based on $s(\\mathbf{r})$. It correctly identifies that the difference between functionals is negligible for $s \\ll 1$ and significant for $s \\gg 1$. It correctly states that the Becke $88$ enhancement factor makes BLYP exchange energy more negative in the tails. It correctly deduces that as $R$ increases, $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{xc}}(R)$ becomes more negative, stabilizing the fragments more. It correctly concludes that this reduces binding and shifts the potential minimum to a larger $R$. The final statement, that BLYP yields a longer $R_e$ than PBE, is the correct result of this sound reasoning. **Correct**.\n\n**B.** This option incorrectly proposes to focus only on the core region where $s \\ll 1$. The differences between various GGA functionals are most pronounced in regions of intermediate and large $s$, which this option wrongly neglects. Its conclusion that the functionals will predict nearly identical bond lengths is contrary to both the theoretical analysis and known computational results. **Incorrect**.\n\n**C.** This option makes a factually incorrect claim that PBE has a larger exchange enhancement factor than Becke $88$ for $s \\gg 1$. This directly contradicts fact (ii) provided in the problem statement. All subsequent reasoning is based on this false premise, leading to the opposite and incorrect conclusion that PBE should give longer bond lengths. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D.** This option claims that a qualitative prediction is impossible without a full self-consistent calculation. This negates the very purpose of conceptual DFT analysis, which aims to build physical intuition from the mathematical structure of the functionals. The provided model and facts are specifically designed to allow for a rigorous qualitative conclusion. The statement that the functional dependence is \"too nonlocal\" is misleading for semilocal GGAs. A valid qualitative prediction is indeed possible. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2639040"}]}
