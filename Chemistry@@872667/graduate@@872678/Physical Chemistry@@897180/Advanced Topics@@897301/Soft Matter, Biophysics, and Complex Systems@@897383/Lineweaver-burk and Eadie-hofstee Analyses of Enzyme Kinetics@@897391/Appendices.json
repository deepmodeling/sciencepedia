We set $1/v = 0$ in the LB equation:\n$$\n0 = \\left(\\frac{K_{M}}{V_{\\max}}\\right) x_{0} + \\frac{1}{V_{\\max}}\n$$\nSolving for $x_{0}$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{K_{M}}{V_{\\max}}\\right) x_{0} = -\\frac{1}{V_{\\max}}\n$$\n$$\nx_{0} = -\\frac{1}{V_{\\max}} \\left(\\frac{V_{\\max}}{K_{M}}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{K_{M}}\n$$\nSo, the $x$-intercept is $x_{0} = -1/K_{M}$.\n\nNext, we perform a dimensional analysis to verify the units of these parameters.

The corresponding theoretical initial velocities are:\n- For $[S]_1 = 0.2 K_M$, $v_1 = \\frac{V_{\\max}(0.2 K_M)}{K_M + 0.2 K_M} = \\frac{0.2}{1.2} V_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{6} V_{\\max}$.\n- For $[S]_2 = 1 K_M$, $v_2 = \\frac{V_{\\max}(1 K_M)}{K_M + 1 K_M} = \\frac{1}{2} V_{\\max}$.\n- For $[S]_3 = 5 K_M$, $v_3 = \\frac{V_{\\max}(5 K_M)}{K_M + 5 K_M} = \\frac{5}{6} V_{\\max}$.\n\nThe problem states that the error in $v$ is homoscedastic, meaning the standard deviation of $v$, denoted $\\sigma_v$, is constant for all measurements. Let $\\sigma_v = \\sigma$.\n\n**Analysis of the Lineweaver-Burk (LB) Plot**\n\nThe LB transformation linearizes the Michaelis-Menten equation as:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{v} = \\left(\\frac{K_M}{V_{\\max}}\\right) \\frac{1}{[S]} + \\frac{1}{V_{\\max}}\n$$\nThis is a linear relationship between $y = 1/v$ and $x = 1/[S]$.\n\n1.  **Coordinates and Leverage**:\n    The transformed coordinates $(x_i, y_i) = (1/[S]_i, 1/v_i)$ are:\n    - Point 1: $(1/(0.2 K_M), 1/(V_{\\max}/6)) = (5/K_M, 6/V_{\\max})$\n    - Point 2: $(1/(1 K_M), 1/(V_{\\max}/2)) = (1/K_M, 2/V_{\\max})$\n    - Point 3: $(1/(5 K_M), 1/(V_{\\max}/1.2)) = (0.2/K_M, 1.2/V_{\\max})$\n    In OLS regression, the influence or \"leverage\" of a point is strongly dependent on its distance from the mean of the abscissa values, $\\bar{x}$. The abscissae are $5/K_M$, $1/K_M$, and $0.2/K_M$. The point at $[S]=0.2 K_M$ has an abscissa $x_1 = 5/K_M$, which is significantly larger than the others and far from their mean. This gives it the highest geometric leverage.\n\n2.  **Error Propagation**:\n    The variance in the transformed ordinate, $\\sigma_y^2 = \\sigma_{1/v}^2$, is found by error propagation.\n    Given $y = 1/v$, the derivative is $dy/dv = -1/v^2$. The variance propagates as:\n    $$\n    \\sigma_{1/v}^2 \\approx \\left(\\frac{d(1/v)}{dv}\\right)^2 \\sigma_v^2 = \\left(\\frac{-1}{v^2}\\right)^2 \\sigma^2 = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{v^4}\n    $$\n    Since $\\sigma$ is constant, the variance of the transformed point is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the velocity. The point with the lowest velocity will have its error amplified the most. This is the point at the lowest substrate concentration, $[S]_1 = 0.2 K_M$, where $v_1 = V_{\\max}/6$. The variances are:\n    - $\\sigma_{y1}^2 \\propto 1/v_1^4 = 1/((1/6)V_{\\max})^4 = 1296/V_{\\max}^4$\n    - $\\sigma_{y2}^2 \\propto 1/v_2^4 = 1/((1/2)V_{\\max})^4 = 16/V_{\\max}^4$\n    - $\\sigma_{y3}^2 \\propto 1/v_3^4 = 1/((5/6)V_{\\max})^4 \\approx 2.07/V_{\\max}^4$\n    The variance of the point at $[S] = 0.2 K_M$ is vastly larger than the others ($81$ times larger than for the point at $[S]=K_M$).\n\n3.  **Conclusion for LB**: The point at $[S]=0.2 K_M$ has both the highest geometric leverage (largest $x$-value) and the largest error (by far). In an unweighted OLS fit, which incorrectly assumes equal variance for all $y_i$, this single, highly uncertain point will disproportionately pull the fitted line towards itself. It therefore \"dominates\" the fit.\n\n**Analysis of the Eadie-Hofstee (EH) Plot**\n\nThe EH transformation is:\n$$\nv = -K_M \\frac{v}{[S]} + V_{\\max}\n$$\nThis is a linear relationship between $y = v$ and $x = v/[S]$. A critical flaw of this plot is that the experimental variable $v$, which contains error, appears in both the ordinate and the abscissa.\n\n1.  **Coordinates and Leverage**:\n    The transformed coordinates $(x_i, y_i) = (v_i/[S]_i, v_i)$ are:\n    - Point 1: ($(V_{\\max}/6)/(0.2 K_M), V_{\\max}/6) = (V_{\\max}/(1.2 K_M), V_{\\max}/6) \\approx (0.833 V_{\\max}/K_M, 0.167 V_{\\max})$\n    - Point 2: ($(V_{\\max}/2)/(1 K_M), V_{\\max}/2) = (V_{\\max}/(2 K_M), V_{\\max}/2) = (0.5 V_{\\max}/K_M, 0.5 V_{\\max})$\n    - Point 3: ($(5V_{\\max}/6)/(5 K_M), 5V_{\\max}/6) = (V_{\\max}/(6 K_M), 5V_{\\max}/6) \\approx (0.167 V_{\\max}/K_M, 0.833 V_{\\max})$\n    The abscissae $x_i$ decrease as $[S]_i$ increases. The point at $[S]=0.2 K_M$ has the largest abscissa. The spread of points is less extreme than in the LB plot. The mean abscissa is $\\bar{x} = (V_{\\max}/K_M)(1/1.2 + 1/2 + 1/6)/3 = 0.5 V_{\\max}/K_M$, which is exactly $x_2$. Points 1 and 3 are equidistant from the mean, giving them equal geometric leverage in the $x$ dimension.\n\n2.  **Error Propagation**:\n    The OLS assumption that the abscissa is error-free is violated. The error in $y=v$ is constant, $\\sigma_y = \\sigma$. The error in $x=v/[S]$ propagates as:\n    $$\n    \\sigma_x^2 = \\sigma_{v/[S]}^2 \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\partial(v/[S])}{\\partial v}\\right)^2 \\sigma_v^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{[S]}\\right)^2 \\sigma^2 = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{[S]^2}\n    $$\n    The error in the abscissa is largest for the smallest $[S]$.\n    - $\\sigma_{x1} = \\sigma/(0.2 K_M) = 5\\sigma/K_M$\n    - $\\sigma_{x2} = \\sigma/(1 K_M) = \\sigma/K_M$\n    - $\\sigma_{x3} = \\sigma/(5 K_M) = 0.2\\sigma/K_M$\n    The point at $[S]=0.2 K_M$ has the largest error in its $x$-coordinate.\n\n3.  **Conclusion for EH**: The leverage is more balanced than in the LB plot. However, the determination of the slope, $-K_M$, is driven by the range of the $x$-coordinates. The points at $[S]=0.2 K_M$ ($x_1 \\approx 0.833 V_{\\max}/K_M$) and $[S]=1 K_M$ ($x_2 = 0.5 V_{\\max}/K_M$) define the rightward, high-leverage portion of the line. The point at $[S]=5 K_M$ ($x_3 \\approx 0.167 V_{\\max}/K_M$) is compressed toward the $y$-axis. Although Point 3 has leverage due to its distance from $\\bar{x}$, the slope is more sensitive to the positions of the points with larger $x$ values, which are points 1 and 2. Thus, these two points will primarily drive the fit for the slope, more so than the point at high substrate concentration.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A**: Incorrect. It correctly identifies the dominant point for the LB plot but incorrectly claims the point at $[S]=5 K_M$ dominates the EH plot. The point at $[S]=5 K_M$ is close to the $y$-intercept and has a small $x$-coordinate, giving it less influence on the slope compared to the other points.\n*   **B**: Correct. It accurately describes the situation for the LB plot, citing both the large abscissa ($1/[S]$) and the amplified variance in $1/v$ for the point at $[S]=0.2 K_M$. It also correctly describes the EH plot: leverage is less skewed, but the points with the largest abscissae ($v/[S]$), corresponding to $[S]=0.2 K_M$ and $[S]=1 K_M$, will primarily determine the fitted slope.\n*   **C**: Incorrect. It falsely claims the point at $[S]=1 K_M$ dominates the LB plot. This point has intermediate leverage and intermediate propagated error, making it much less influential than the point at $[S]=0.2 K_M$.\n*   **D**: Incorrect. It incorrectly claims the point at $[S]=5 K_M$ dominates both plots. In the LB plot, this point is the *least* influential as it lies closest to the origin with the smallest propagated error. While it helps define the intercept in the EH plot, it does not dominate the overall fit, especially the slope. The reasoning about smallest relative error in $v$ is true but irrelevant for an unweighted fit in transformed coordinates where absolute errors in the transformed variables matter.\n\nTherefore, Option B provides the most complete and accurate analysis based on the principles of error propagation and linear regression.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2647791"}, {"introduction": "This final exercise delves into a subtle but profound statistical issue inherent in the Lineweaver-Burk method.

In this model system, $\\mu$ represents $V_{\\max}$, so the true intercept is $1/\\mu$. Because the data points for $1/v$ are biased high, a linear regression will yield an intercept that overestimates the true value $1/V_{\\max}$, thus causing a systematic underestimation of $V_{\\max}$.\n\nIn contrast, the Eadie-Hofstee (EH) representation plots $v$ versus $v/[S]$ based on the rearranged Michaelis-Menten equation $v = V_{\\max} - K_M(v/[S])$. The dependent variable (y-axis) in this plot is $v$ itself. Given that the measurement error is additive in $v$, the expected value of the dependent variable is $E[v] = \\mu$. There is no non-linear transformation applied to the dependent variable, and thus the specific bias identified for the LB plot ($E[1/v] > 1/E[v]$) does not occur for the ordinate in the EH analysis. While the EH plot is not free from statistical problems (notably, the independent variable $v/[S]$ also contains the error-prone quantity $v$), it is not susceptible to the same type of systematic bias in the y-values that arises from the reciprocal transformation in the LB plot.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.01 \\times 10^{6}}\n$$", "id": "2647795"}]}
