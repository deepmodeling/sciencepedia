Calculate the terms required for the final expression:\n    \\begin{itemize}\n        \\item The prefactor of the exponent: $\\frac{m \\ell_B}{2R} = \\frac{60 \\times (7.14336 \\times 10^{-10}\\,\\mathrm{m})}{2 \\times (2.5 \\times 10^{-9}\\,\\mathrm{m})} \\approx 8.57203$.\n        \\item The bracketed term in the exponent:\n        $$ \\frac{1}{1+\\kappa_2 R} - \\frac{1}{1+\\kappa_1 R} \\approx \\frac{1}{1+2.5994} - \\frac{1}{1+0.25994} \\approx 0.277823 - 0.793688 \\approx -0.515865 $$\n    \\end{itemize}\n\n5.  Calculate the final ratio:\n    $$ \\frac{c^\\ast(\\kappa_2)}{c^\\ast(\\kappa_1)} = \\exp\\left[ 8.57203 \\times (-0.515865) \\right] = \\exp(-4.4222) \\approx 0.012008 $$\nRounding the result to three significant figures gives $0.0120$. This indicates that increasing the salt concentration by a factor of $100$ decreases the CMC by a factor of approximately $1/0.0120 \\approx 83$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.0120}$$", "id": "2927051"}]}
