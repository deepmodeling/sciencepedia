Assume the dynamics are a continuous-time, time-homogeneous, memoryless two-state process: when in state $A$ the molecule leaves to $B$ with rate constant $k_{AB}$, and when in state $B$ it leaves to $A$ with rate constant $k_{BA}$. Under these conditions, dwell times in $A$ and $B$ are independently and identically distributed exponential random variables parameterized by $k_{AB}$ and $k_{BA}$, respectively.

From this likelihood, derive the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) for $k_{AB}$ and $k_{BA}$, expressing each estimator solely in terms of the number of observed transitions of the corresponding type and the total time spent in the originating state.\n\nThen, using the provided dwell times, evaluate your estimators numerically.

At early times, transitions from both fast ($k_1$) and slow ($k_2$) subpopulations contribute to the observed rate. As time progresses, the faster subpopulation is preferentially depleted because its members undergo transitions more quickly. At long times, the remaining population of molecules consists almost entirely of members of the slower subpopulation. The observed rate thus decreases and asymptotically approaches the slowest rate in the mixture.
