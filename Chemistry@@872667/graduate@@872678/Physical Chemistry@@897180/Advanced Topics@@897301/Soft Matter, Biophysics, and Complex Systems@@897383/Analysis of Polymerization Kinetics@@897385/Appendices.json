Consider two limiting kinetic scenarios that differ only in the microscopic termination mode of the growing radicals: in case A, termination is exclusively by bimolecular combination; in case B, termination is exclusively by bimolecular disproportionation. Let the kinetic chain length $\\bar{\\nu}$ be defined as the average number of propagation steps a radical executes during its lifetime, i.e., $\\bar{\\nu} = R_p/R_i$, where $R_p$ is the rate of monomer consumption by propagation and $R_i$ is the rate at which radicals that successfully initiate growing chains enter the system.

The assumptions provided (steady-state, no chain transfer, etc.) are standard idealizations used to derive elementary kinetic models. The definitions for $\\bar{\\nu}$ and $X_n$ are conventional. The problem is well-posed, objective, and internally consistent, providing all necessary information to derive the requested relationship. It does not violate any criteria for invalidity, such as scientific unsoundness, incompleteness, or ambiguity. The problem is a formalizable and non-trivial exercise in chemical kinetics. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be derived.\n\nThe core of the problem lies in correctly applying the provided definitions to the two distinct termination mechanisms. Let $[P^\\cdot]$ be the total concentration of growing polymer radicals. The fundamental rates are:\n- Rate of initiation: $R_i$, the rate at which active chains are formed.\n- Rate of propagation: $R_p = k_p [M] [P^\\cdot]$, where $k_p$ is the propagation rate constant and $[M]$ is the monomer concentration. This is the primary mode of monomer consumption.\n- Rate of termination: $R_t = 2 k_t [P^\\cdot]^2$, where $k_t$ is the termination rate constant. The factor of $2$ arises because two radicals are consumed in each bimolecular termination event.\n\nThe steady-state assumption for radical concentration dictates that the rate of radical formation equals the rate of radical destruction:\n$$R_i = R_t$$\nThe kinetic chain length is given as $\\bar{\\nu} = R_p/R_i$. Using the steady-state assumption, this is equivalent to:\n$$\\bar{\\nu} = \\frac{R_p}{R_t}$$\nThe number-average degree of polymerization is defined as $X_n = \\frac{\\text{Rate of monomer consumption}}{\\text{Rate of formation of dead polymer molecules}}$. Given that propagation is the dominant pathway for monomer consumption, we have $X_n \\approx \\frac{R_p}{\\text{Rate of formation of dead polymer molecules}}$. We must now determine the rate of formation of dead polymer molecules for each case.\n\nCase A: Termination by Combination.\nIn this mechanism, two growing radicals combine to form a single, larger, dead polymer molecule.\n$$P_m^\\cdot + P_n^\\cdot \\xrightarrow{k_t} P_{m+n}$$\nEach termination event, which occurs at a rate of $k_t [P^\\cdot]^2$, produces *one* dead polymer molecule. The rate of radical loss is $R_t = 2 k_t [P^\\cdot]^2$. Therefore, the rate of formation of dead polymer molecules is:\n$$(\\text{Rate of dead polymer formation})_{\\mathrm{comb}} = k_t [P^\\cdot]^2 = \\frac{R_t}{2}$$\nSubstituting this into the definition of $X_n$:\n$$X_{n, \\mathrm{comb}} = \\frac{R_p}{\\frac{R_t}{2}} = 2 \\frac{R_p}{R_t}$$\nUsing the relation $\\bar{\\nu} = R_p/R_t$, we find the relationship between the degree of polymerization and the kinetic chain length:\n$$X_{n, \\mathrm{comb}} = 2 \\bar{\\nu}$$\n\nCase B: Termination by Disproportionation.\nIn this mechanism, one radical abstracts an atom (typically hydrogen) from another, resulting in two dead polymer molecules.\n$$P_m^\\cdot + P_n^\\cdot \\xrightarrow{k_t} P_m + P_n'$$\nEach termination event, again occurring at a rate of $k_t [P^\\cdot]^2$, produces *two* dead polymer molecules. The rate of radical loss is still $R_t = 2 k_t [P^\\cdot]^2$. The rate of formation of dead polymer molecules is:\n$$(\\text{Rate of dead polymer formation})_{\\mathrm{disp}} = 2 (k_t [P^\\cdot]^2) = R_t$$\nSubstituting this into the definition of $X_n$:\n$$X_{n, \\mathrm{disp}} = \\frac{R_p}{R_t}$$\nUsing the relation $\\bar{\\nu} = R_p/R_t$, we find:\n$$X_{n, \\mathrm{disp}} = \\bar{\\nu}$$\n\nNow, we must compute the ratio $M_{n,\\mathrm{comb}}/M_{n,\\mathrm{disp}}$. From the definition $M_n = X_n M_0$, the ratio of molecular weights is identical to the ratio of the degrees of polymerization:\n$$\\frac{M_{n, \\mathrm{comb}}}{M_{n, \\mathrm{disp}}} = \\frac{X_{n, \\mathrm{comb}} M_0}{X_{n, \\mathrm{disp}} M_0} = \\frac{X_{n, \\mathrm{comb}}}{X_{n, \\mathrm{disp}}}$$\nThe problem specifies that the comparison is made for a fixed rate of propagation, $R_p$, and \"otherwise identical conditions.\" \"Identical conditions\" implies that the temperature, initial monomer concentration, and initiation system (initiator type and concentration) are the same for both hypothetical cases. This means the rate of initiation, $R_i$, is identical in both scenarios.\nSince $R_p$ is fixed and $R_i$ is identical for both cases, the kinetic chain length, $\\bar{\\nu} = R_p/R_i$, must also be the same for both cases. Let this common value be $\\bar{\\nu}$.\n\nWe can now compute the required ratio:\n$$\\frac{M_{n, \\mathrm{comb}}}{M_{n, \\mathrm{disp}}} = \\frac{X_{n, \\mathrm{comb}}}{X_{n, \\mathrm{disp}}} = \\frac{2 \\bar{\\nu}}{\\bar{\\nu}}$$\nThe term $\\bar{\\nu}$ cancels, yielding a pure number.\n$$\\frac{M_{n, \\mathrm{comb}}}{M_{n, \\mathrm{disp}}} = 2$$\nThis result is a fundamental consequence of the stoichiometry of the termination reaction. For a given number of radicals terminated, combination produces half as many polymer molecules as disproportionation, leading to a number-average molecular weight that is twice as large.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2623388"}, {"introduction": "Much of conventional kinetic analysis, including the reasoning in the previous exercise, relies on the powerful steady-state approximation (SSA), which assumes the concentration of radical intermediates is constant.

The problem is firmly grounded in established scientific principles.\n2.  **Well-Posedness and Consistency**: The problem is well-posed. It presents a clear initial value problem for a first-order ordinary differential equation which can be constructed from the given kinetic scheme. The parameters $R_i$ and $k_t$ are defined, and the initial condition $[R\\cdot](0)=0$ is specified, ensuring that a unique mathematical solution exists. There are no internal contradictions.\n3.  **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and quantitative terms common to the field of chemical kinetics. It is free from ambiguity and subjective interpretation.\n\nThe problem is therefore deemed valid. We may now proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe time evolution of the total radical concentration, $[R\\cdot](t)$, is described by a rate equation that balances the rate of radical generation and the rate of radical destruction.\n$$\n\\frac{d[R\\cdot]}{dt} = (\\text{rate of generation}) - (\\text{rate of destruction})\n$$\nThe rate of generation is given as a constant, $R_i$.\nThe rate of destruction is through termination. The process is bimolecular recombination, represented as $R\\cdot + R\\cdot \\xrightarrow{k_t} \\text{Product}$. According to the law of mass action, the rate of this reaction is $k_t [R\\cdot]^2$. Since two radical species are consumed in each termination event, the rate of destruction of radicals is twice the rate of the termination reaction. Thus, the rate of destruction is $2 k_t [R\\cdot]^2$.\n\nCombining these terms gives the governing ordinary differential equation (ODE) for the radical concentration:\n$$\n\\frac{d[R\\cdot]}{dt} = R_i - 2 k_t [R\\cdot]^2\n$$\nThis ODE is to be solved with the initial condition $[R\\cdot](0) = 0$. This is a separable first-order nonlinear ODE. Let $y(t) = [R\\cdot](t)$. The equation can be written as:\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{R_i - 2 k_t y^2} = dt\n$$\nWe integrate both sides from the initial state ($t=0$, $y=0$) to a state at time $t$ (where the concentration is $y(t)$):\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{y(t)} \\frac{d\\tilde{y}}{R_i - 2 k_t \\tilde{y}^2} = \\int_{0}^{t} d\\tau\n$$\nThe right side integrates to $t$.

First, we derive an expression for the heat generation rate and the associated amplification factor due to the gel effect. Second, we calculate the maximum adiabatic temperature rise.\n\n**Part 1: Heat Generation Rate and Amplification Factor**\n\nThe rate of polymerization, $R_{p}$, is defined as the rate of monomer consumption. According to mass-action kinetics for chain propagation, this rate is given by:\n$$\nR_{p} = - \\frac{dC_{M}}{dt} = k_{p} C_{M} [R\\cdot]\n$$\nwhere $k_{p}$ is the propagation rate constant, $C_{M}$ is the monomer concentration, and $[R\\cdot]$ is the total concentration of chain radicals.\n\nWe apply the steady-state approximation (SSA) for the radical concentration. This approximation posits that the rate of radical generation is equal to the rate of radical termination. The volumetric initiation rate is given as a constant, $R_{i}$. Termination is a bimolecular process where two radicals are consumed, so the rate of termination is $2k_{t}[R\\cdot]^{2}$.

The enthalpy of polymerization, $\\Delta H_p$, is given as a negative value. Therefore, the heat released per mole of monomer reacted is $-\\Delta H_p$. The total heat generation rate per unit volume is the product of the polymerization rate and this molar enthalpy change:\n$$\nq_{\\mathrm{gen}} = R_{p} (-\\Delta H_{p}) = k_{p} C_{M} \\left( \\frac{R_{i}}{2 k_{t}} \\right)^{1/2} (-\\Delta H_{p})\n$$\nWe are given the relations for monomer concentration, $C_{M}(t) = C_{M0}(1-x)$, and the termination rate constant's dependence on conversion, $k_{t}(x) = k_{t0} \\exp(-\\alpha x)$. The rate of polymerization is thus a function of conversion, $x$, and temperature, $T$ (since $k_p$ and $k_{t0}$ are temperature-dependent):\n$$\nR_{p}(x,T) = k_{p}(T) C_{M0}(1-x) \\left( \\frac{R_{i}}{2 k_{t0}(T) \\exp(-\\alpha x)} \\right)^{1/2}\n$$\nThe heat generation rate with the gel effect, $q_{\\mathrm{gen}}^{\\mathrm{gel}}(x,T)$, is therefore:\n$$\nq_{\\mathrm{gen}}^{\\mathrm{gel}}(x,T) = k_{p}(T) C_{M0}(1-x) \\left( \\frac{R_{i}}{2 k_{t0}(T) \\exp(-\\alpha x)} \\right)^{1/2} (-\\Delta H_{p})\n$$\nThis is the general expression for the heat generation rate per unit volume.\n\nTo find the amplification factor $\\mathcal{A}(x)$, we consider the case without the gel effect.

Solving for $\\Delta T_{\\max}$:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\max} = \\frac{C_{M0} (-\\Delta H_{p}) x_{f}}{\\rho C_{p}}\n$$\nWe now substitute the provided numerical values:\n$\\Delta H_{p} = -7.2 \\times 10^{4} \\ \\mathrm{J} \\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, so $-\\Delta H_{p} = 7.2 \\times 10^{4} \\ \\mathrm{J} \\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.\n$C_{M0} = 8.50 \\ \\mathrm{mol} \\ \\mathrm{L}^{-1}$.\n$\\rho = 0.95 \\ \\mathrm{kg} \\ \\mathrm{L}^{-1}$.\n$C_{p} = 1.80 \\times 10^{3} \\ \\mathrm{J} \\ \\mathrm{kg}^{-1} \\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.\n$x_{f} = 0.65$.\n\nThe calculation proceeds as follows:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\max} = \\frac{(8.50 \\ \\mathrm{mol \\cdot L^{-1}}) \\times (7.2 \\times 10^{4} \\ \\mathrm{J \\cdot mol^{-1}}) \\times 0.65}{(0.95 \\ \\mathrm{kg \\cdot L^{-1}}) \\times (1.80 \\times 10^{3} \\ \\mathrm{J \\cdot kg^{-1} \\cdot K^{-1}})}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\max} = \\frac{397800 \\ \\mathrm{J \\cdot L^{-1}}}{1710 \\ \\mathrm{J \\cdot L^{-1} \\cdot K^{-1}}} = 232.63157... \\ \\mathrm{K}\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as instructed gives:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\max} \\approx 232.6 \\ \\mathrm{K}\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\pmatrix{\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\alpha x}{2}\\right)  232.6}}\n$$", "id": "2623402"}]}
