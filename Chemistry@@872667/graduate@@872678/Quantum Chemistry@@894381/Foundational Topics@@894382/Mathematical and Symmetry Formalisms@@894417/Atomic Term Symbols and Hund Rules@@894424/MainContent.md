## Introduction
The quantum mechanics of [multi-electron atoms](@entry_id:157716) presents a significant challenge: a single [electronic configuration](@entry_id:272104), such as carbon's $1s^2 2s^2 2p^2$, corresponds not to a single energy, but to a [complex manifold](@entry_id:261516) of distinct quantum states. The subtle interplay of electron-electron repulsion and [relativistic spin](@entry_id:193090)-orbit effects lifts the degeneracy of these states, creating a rich energy level structure. This article addresses the fundamental problem of how to classify, label, and energetically order these states. The solution lies in the elegant framework of **Atomic Term Symbols** and the predictive power of **Hund's Rules**.

This article will equip you with a deep understanding of this cornerstone of quantum chemistry. In the first chapter, **Principles and Mechanisms**, we will deconstruct the Russell-Saunders coupling scheme, detailing the step-by-step process for constructing [term symbols](@entry_id:151575) and applying Hund's rules to identify the ground state. Next, in **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, we will explore the profound impact of this framework, showing how it provides the language to interpret [atomic spectroscopy](@entry_id:155968), predict magnetic properties, and bridge the gap to [coordination chemistry](@entry_id:153771) and materials science. Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** section will offer opportunities to apply these principles to concrete problems, solidifying your theoretical knowledge.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The electronic structure of a multi-electron atom is a complex quantum mechanical system governed by kinetic energy, electron-nucleus attraction, and [electron-electron repulsion](@entry_id:154978). Within the [central-field approximation](@entry_id:177697), we organize electronic states into configurations, such as $1s^2 2s^2 2p^2$ for carbon. However, a single configuration typically encompasses a multitude of distinct quantum states which, while degenerate in the simplest approximation, are split in energy by more subtle effects. The primary interactions responsible for lifting this degeneracy are the residual electrostatic repulsion between electrons and the relativistic spin-orbit interaction. The framework for understanding and classifying these energy states in lighter atoms is the **Russell-Saunders coupling scheme**, also known as **LS coupling**.

This chapter details the principles and mechanisms that govern the determination of atomic energy states within the LS coupling framework, leading to the construction of **[atomic term symbols](@entry_id:173554)** and the prediction of the [ground state energy](@entry_id:146823) using **Hund's rules**.

### The Russell-Saunders Coupling Hierarchy

The Russell-Saunders scheme is a perturbative approach founded on a clear hierarchy of energy scales, which is highly accurate for light atoms (those with low nuclear charge, $Z$). The total Hamiltonian is conceptually partitioned:

$H = H_{\text{central field}} + H_{\text{Coulomb}} + H_{\text{SO}}$

Here, $H_{\text{central field}}$ describes electrons moving independently in an average, spherically [symmetric potential](@entry_id:148561). Its eigenstates define the electronic configurations. The remaining terms are treated as perturbations. In the LS coupling regime, the ordering of these perturbations is crucial: the electrostatic repulsion between electrons ($H_{\text{Coulomb}}$) is significantly stronger than the spin-orbit interaction ($H_{\text{SO}}$).

1.  **Dominant Perturbation: Electrostatic Repulsion ($H_{\text{Coulomb}}$)**: This term accounts for the non-central part of the electron-electron Coulomb repulsion, which was averaged out in the [central-field approximation](@entry_id:177697). Since the fundamental Coulomb interaction is independent of spin, the Hamiltonian $H_{\text{Coulomb}}$ commutes with the [total orbital angular momentum](@entry_id:265302) operator squared, $\mathbf{L}^2$, and the [total spin angular momentum](@entry_id:175552) operator squared, $\mathbf{S}^2$ [@problem_id:2874680]. This means that the eigenstates of $H_{\text{central field}} + H_{\text{Coulomb}}$ can be characterized by the quantum numbers **$L$ (total orbital angular momentum)** and **$S$ ([total spin angular momentum](@entry_id:175552))**. This interaction splits a degenerate configuration into a set of **terms**, each with a specific $L$ and $S$ value. The energy difference between these terms is typically on the order of $0.1$ to $1$ eV.

2.  **Secondary Perturbation: Spin-Orbit Interaction ($H_{\text{SO}}$)**: This is a relativistic effect that couples each electron's [spin magnetic moment](@entry_id:272337) to the magnetic field generated by its own orbital motion. Its strength scales steeply with nuclear charge (approximately as $Z^4$) and is much weaker than the electrostatic repulsion in light atoms [@problem_id:2874680]. Typical spin-orbit splittings for light atoms are in the range of $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-1}$ eV [@problem_id:2874680]. This interaction splits a given term (fixed $L$ and $S$) into a multiplet of closely spaced **levels**, each distinguished by a specific value of the **$J$ ([total angular momentum](@entry_id:155748))** [quantum number](@entry_id:148529).

This hierarchy, $H_{\text{Coulomb}} \gg H_{\text{SO}}$, dictates the coupling strategy: first, the individual electron orbital angular momenta ($\mathbf{l}_i$) are coupled to form a total $\mathbf{L}$, and individual spins ($\mathbf{s}_i$) are coupled to form a total $\mathbf{S}$. Only then are $\mathbf{L}$ and $\mathbf{S}$ coupled to form the total angular momentum $\mathbf{J} = \mathbf{L} + \mathbf{S}$.

### Defining Atomic Terms: The $^{2S+1}L_J$ Symbol

An atomic state in the LS coupling scheme is uniquely identified by a [term symbol](@entry_id:171918) of the form $^{2S+1}L_J$. Let us deconstruct this notation piece by piece [@problem_id:2874629].

#### Total Orbital and Spin Angular Momentum ($L$ and $S$)

The total orbital angular momentum operator $\mathbf{L}$ and [total spin angular momentum](@entry_id:175552) operator $\mathbf{S}$ are vector sums of the individual electron operators:
$\mathbf{L} = \sum_i \mathbf{l}_i$
$\mathbf{S} = \sum_i \mathbf{s}_i$

The corresponding [quantum numbers](@entry_id:145558), $L$ and $S$, are determined by the rules of [angular momentum addition](@entry_id:156081). For a two-electron system with [quantum numbers](@entry_id:145558) ($l_1$, $s_1$) and ($l_2$, $s_2$), the possible values for the total [quantum numbers](@entry_id:145558) are:
$L \in \{ |l_1 - l_2|, |l_1 - l_2| + 1, \dots, l_1 + l_2 \}$
$S \in \{ |s_1 - s_2|, |s_1 - s_2| + 1, \dots, s_1 + s_2 \}$

For example, consider coupling two non-[equivalent electrons](@entry_id:201572), one in a $p$-orbital ($l_1=1$) and one in a $d$-orbital ($l_2=2$) [@problem_id:2624453]. The possible total orbital angular momentum values are $L \in \{ |1-2|, \dots, 1+2 \} = \{1, 2, 3\}$. For two electrons, each with $s=1/2$, the [total spin](@entry_id:153335) can be $S \in \{ |1/2-1/2|, \dots, 1/2+1/2 \} = \{0, 1\}$ [@problem_id:2624441]. This gives rise to terms with $S=0$ (**singlet** states) and $S=1$ (**triplet** states).

A crucial simplification is that **any completely filled subshell has a total orbital angular momentum $L=0$ and a [total spin angular momentum](@entry_id:175552) $S=0$** [@problem_id:2874629]. This is because for every electron with a given projection $m_l$, there is another with $-m_l$, and for every electron with spin-up ($m_s = +1/2$), there is another with spin-down ($m_s = -1/2$). Their vector sums are zero. Consequently, to determine the [term symbol](@entry_id:171918) for an atom, we need only consider the electrons in partially filled subshells (the **valence electrons**).

#### Spectroscopic Notation and Spin Multiplicity

The numerical value of the total orbital angular momentum quantum number $L$ is represented by a capital letter according to the following historical convention:
- $L=0 \to \text{S}$
- $L=1 \to \text{P}$
- $L=2 \to \text{D}$
- $L=3 \to \text{F}$
For $L > 3$, the sequence continues alphabetically, skipping the letter J (which is reserved for the total [angular momentum quantum number](@entry_id:172069)): G, H, I, K, etc. [@problem_id:2874629].

The superscript preceding the $L$ symbol is the **[spin multiplicity](@entry_id:263865)**, defined as $2S+1$. This value indicates the number of possible projections of the [total spin](@entry_id:153335) vector $\mathbf{S}$ onto a quantization axis ($M_S = -S, -S+1, \dots, +S$). For example, a state with $S=1$ has a [multiplicity](@entry_id:136466) of $2(1)+1=3$ and is called a [triplet state](@entry_id:156705). A state with $S=0$ has a multiplicity of $1$ and is a [singlet state](@entry_id:154728).

It is critical not to confuse the spectroscopic letter S (for $L=0$) with the quantum number $S$ for total spin. For instance, the ground state of the Nitrogen atom ($2p^3$) is $^{4}\text{S}_{3/2}$. Here, the letter is S because $L=0$, but the spin is $S=3/2$, leading to a [multiplicity](@entry_id:136466) of $4$ [@problem_id:2874629].

A collection of states with the same $L$ and $S$ values constitutes a **term**, denoted $^{2S+1}L$. In the absence of spin-orbit coupling, all states within this term are degenerate. The degeneracy of a term is $(2L+1)(2S+1)$, corresponding to the number of distinct ($M_L, M_S$) pairs [@problem_id:2624427].

### The Pauli Principle and Equivalent Electrons

When electrons occupy the same subshell (e.g., the $p^2$ configuration), they are called **[equivalent electrons](@entry_id:201572)**. In this case, the **Pauli exclusion principle** imposes a stringent constraint beyond simply occupying different single-particle states. The total electronic wavefunction $\Psi$, a product of its spatial and spin parts, must be antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of any two electrons.

The spin part of the wavefunction for two electrons has a defined symmetry: it is symmetric for a triplet state ($S=1$) and antisymmetric for a singlet state ($S=0$) [@problem_id:2624412]. For the total wavefunction to be antisymmetric, the spatial part must have the opposite symmetry:
- If $S=1$ (symmetric spin), the spatial part must be antisymmetric.
- If $S=0$ (antisymmetric spin), the spatial part must be symmetric.

For two [equivalent electrons](@entry_id:201572) in a subshell with [orbital quantum number](@entry_id:164193) $l$, the symmetry of the coupled spatial part is determined by the total [orbital quantum number](@entry_id:164193) $L$: it is symmetric if $L$ is even and antisymmetric if $L$ is odd. This leads to a fundamental selection rule: **for two [equivalent electrons](@entry_id:201572), the sum $L+S$ must be an even integer** [@problem_id:2624412].

Let's apply this to the $p^2$ configuration ($l_1=l_2=1$) [@problem_id:2624427]. For non-[equivalent electrons](@entry_id:201572), we would expect terms with $L \in \{0, 1, 2\}$ and $S \in \{0, 1\}$, leading to potential terms $^1\text{S}, ^3\text{S}, ^1\text{P}, ^3\text{P}, ^1\text{D}, ^3\text{D}$. However, for equivalent $p$ electrons, the Pauli principle allows only those combinations where $L+S$ is even:
- $L=0$ (even) requires $S=0$ (even): $^1\text{S}$ is allowed. $^3\text{S}$ ($L=0, S=1$) is forbidden.
- $L=1$ (odd) requires $S=1$ (odd): $^3\text{P}$ is allowed. $^1\text{P}$ ($L=1, S=0$) is forbidden.
- $L=2$ (even) requires $S=0$ (even): $^1\text{D}$ is allowed. $^3\text{D}$ ($L=2, S=1$) is forbidden.

Thus, the $p^2$ configuration gives rise to only three terms: $^1\text{S}$, $^3\text{P}$, and $^1\text{D}$.

The total number of unique quantum states (**[microstates](@entry_id:147392)**) for a configuration can be verified by summing the degeneracies of the allowed terms. For $p^2$:
- $^1\text{S}$ term ($L=0, S=0$): degeneracy = $(2(0)+1)(2(0)+1) = 1$
- $^3\text{P}$ term ($L=1, S=1$): degeneracy = $(2(1)+1)(2(1)+1) = 9$
- $^1\text{D}$ term ($L=2, S=0$): degeneracy = $(2(2)+1)(2(0)+1) = 5$
Total [microstates](@entry_id:147392) = $1+9+5 = 15$.

This must match a direct combinatorial calculation. A $p$-subshell ($l=1$) has $2(2l+1) = 6$ available single-electron states (orbitals). The number of ways to place 2 indistinguishable electrons into these 6 states is given by the [binomial coefficient](@entry_id:156066) $\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!4!} = 15$. The perfect agreement validates our derivation of the allowed terms [@problem_id:2624427].

### Fine Structure and Total Angular Momentum ($J$)

The final piece of the term symbol, the subscript $J$, specifies the **total angular momentum quantum number**. It arises from the coupling of the total orbital and total spin angular momenta: $\mathbf{J} = \mathbf{L} + \mathbf{S}$. This coupling is driven by the [spin-orbit interaction](@entry_id:143481), which splits each term into a set of distinct energy **levels**. The possible values for $J$ for a given term are:
$J \in \{ |L-S|, |L-S|+1, \dots, L+S \}$

Each level, specified by a unique $J$, has a degeneracy of $2J+1$ in the absence of external fields [@problem_id:2624427]. For our $p^2$ terms:
- $^3\text{P}$ term ($L=1, S=1$): $J \in \{0, 1, 2\}$. This term splits into three levels: $^3\text{P}_0, ^3\text{P}_1, ^3\text{P}_2$.
- $^1\text{D}$ term ($L=2, S=0$): $J=2$. This term consists of a single level: $^1\text{D}_2$.
- $^1\text{S}$ term ($L=0, S=0$): $J=0$. This term consists of a single level: $^1\text{S}_0$.

The sum of the level degeneracies ($2J+1$) must also equal the total number of [microstates](@entry_id:147392):
For $p^2$: $(2(0)+1) + (2(1)+1) + (2(2)+1) + (2(2)+1) + (2(0)+1) = 1 + 3 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 15$.

### Hund's Rules: Identifying the Ground State

For a given electron configuration, Hund's rules provide an empirical, yet physically justified, recipe for identifying the term and level with the lowest energy (the **ground state**). They are applied sequentially.

#### Hund's First Rule: Maximize Total Spin $S$

*For a given [electron configuration](@entry_id:147395), the term with the maximum possible value of the total spin quantum number $S$ (and thus the highest [spin multiplicity](@entry_id:263865)) lies lowest in energy.*

**Justification**: This rule is a direct consequence of the Pauli principle and electron-electron Coulomb repulsion [@problem_id:2624413]. States with higher total spin (more parallel spins) must have a more spatially [antisymmetric wavefunction](@entry_id:153813). An antisymmetric spatial function has a reduced [probability amplitude](@entry_id:150609) when two electrons are close together ($\Psi(\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2) = 0$ if $\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{r}_2$). By keeping the electrons farther apart on average, this "exchange correlation" effect reduces their mutual Coulomb repulsion, thus lowering the total energy.

For the $p^2$ configuration, the allowed terms are $^1\text{S}$ ($S=0$), $^1\text{D}$ ($S=0$), and $^3\text{P}$ ($S=1$). The maximum spin is $S=1$, so the $^3\text{P}$ term is the ground term.

#### Hund's Second Rule: Maximize Total Orbital Angular Momentum $L$

*For the terms with the maximum value of $S$, the one with the largest value of the total [orbital angular momentum [quantum numbe](@entry_id:167573)r](@entry_id:148529) $L$ lies lowest in energy.*

**Justification**: This rule also arises from minimizing [electron-electron repulsion](@entry_id:154978), but through a different mechanism related to angular correlation [@problem_id:2624408]. A state with a high $L$ value can be pictured semi-classically as one where electrons orbit the nucleus in a correlated "co-rotating" motion. This correlated movement allows them to maintain larger angular separations, avoiding close encounters and thereby reducing their average [electrostatic repulsion](@entry_id:162128). A low $L$ state, where individual $\mathbf{l}_i$ vectors are opposed, implies more frequent "head-on" approaches and higher repulsion.

In our $p^2$ example, Hund's first rule already uniquely identified the $^3\text{P}$ term. If we were considering the $f^2$ configuration, the terms with maximum spin ($S=1$) are $^3\text{P}$ ($L=1$), $^3\text{F}$ ($L=3$), and $^3\text{H}$ ($L=5$). Hund's second rule predicts that the $^3\text{H}$ term will be the lowest in energy [@problem_id:2624412].

#### Hund's Third Rule: Determine the Ground Level $J$

*For a given term (fixed $L$ and $S$), the ordering of the J-levels depends on the filling of the subshell:*
- *If the subshell is **less than half-filled**, the level with the **minimum** value of $J$ lies lowest.*
- *If the subshell is **more than half-filled**, the level with the **maximum** value of $J$ lies lowest.*

**Justification**: This rule is a consequence of the [spin-orbit interaction](@entry_id:143481), $H_{\text{SO}}$. Within a given term, this interaction's energy shift can be modeled as $\Delta E_J \propto A \langle \mathbf{L} \cdot \mathbf{S} \rangle$, where $\langle \mathbf{L} \cdot \mathbf{S} \rangle = \frac{\hbar^2}{2}[J(J+1) - L(L+1) - S(S+1)]$. The sign of the effective [coupling constant](@entry_id:160679) $A$ determines the ordering. Through a concept known as electron-hole symmetry, it can be shown that $A$ is effectively positive for less-than-half-filled shells and negative for more-than-half-filled shells [@problem_id:2624380].
- For $A>0$ (less than half-filled), energy increases with $J$, so the minimum $J$ is lowest.
- For $A0$ (more than half-filled), energy decreases with $J$, so the maximum $J$ is lowest.

For the $p^2$ configuration, the $p$ shell can hold 6 electrons, so it is less than half-filled. The ground term is $^3\text{P}$ ($L=1, S=1$), with possible $J$ values of $0, 1, 2$. Hund's third rule predicts the lowest energy level is the one with minimum $J$, which is $J=0$. Therefore, the ground state level for a carbon atom is $^3\text{P}_0$.

### An Additional Quantum Number: Parity

Term symbols are sometimes annotated with a right superscript indicating **parity**. Parity refers to the behavior of the total spatial electronic wavefunction under inversion of all electron coordinates ($\mathbf{r}_i \to -\mathbf{r}_i$). The [parity operator](@entry_id:148434) $\hat{\Pi}$ has eigenvalues of $+1$ (even parity) or $-1$ ([odd parity](@entry_id:175830)).

For a multi-electron system in the [orbital approximation](@entry_id:153714), the total parity is the product of the parities of the individual occupied orbitals. A single-electron orbital with quantum number $l_i$ has a parity of $(-1)^{l_i}$. Thus, the total parity is:
$P = (-1)^{\sum_i l_i}$

The sum is taken over all electrons in the atom. Since [closed subshells](@entry_id:196468) always contain an even number of electrons, their contribution to the sum $\sum l_i$ is always even, and their parity is always even ($+1$). Therefore, parity is determined solely by the electrons in open subshells [@problem_id:2624422].

**The convention is to denote odd parity ($P=-1$) with a superscript 'o'. Even parity ($P=+1$) is the default and is indicated by the absence of a superscript.**

For example:
- **$p^2$ configuration**: Two electrons with $l=1$. $\sum l_i = 1+1=2$. Parity is $(-1)^2 = +1$ (even). All terms ($^1\text{S}, ^3\text{P}, ^1\text{D}$) have [even parity](@entry_id:172953) and carry no superscript [@problem_id:2624422].
- **$f^3 d^2 s^1$ configuration**: Electrons have $l_f=3, l_d=2, l_s=0$. $\sum l_i = 3(3) + 2(2) + 1(0) = 9+4+0=13$. Parity is $(-1)^{13}=-1$ (odd). All terms from this configuration would be written with an 'o' superscript, e.g., $^{2S+1}L_J^o$ [@problem_id:2624422].

Parity is a property of the entire configuration and is shared by all terms arising from it. It does not depend on $L$ or $S$.

### Limits of Applicability: From LS to jj-Coupling

The Russell-Saunders coupling scheme, and by extension Hund's rules, provides an excellent description for light atoms. However, its validity wanes as the nuclear charge $Z$ increases [@problem_id:2624399].

The strength of the spin-orbit interaction for a single electron scales approximately as $Z^4$, while the [electrostatic interaction](@entry_id:198833) that splits a configuration into terms scales only as $Z$. Consequently, for heavy atoms, the [spin-orbit interaction](@entry_id:143481) can become comparable to or even stronger than the residual electrostatic repulsion. When this happens, the LS coupling hierarchy breaks down.

In the extreme limit for very [heavy elements](@entry_id:272514), the **[jj-coupling](@entry_id:140838) scheme** becomes more appropriate. In this scheme, the [spin-orbit interaction](@entry_id:143481) for each electron is so strong that its orbital and spin angular momenta, $\mathbf{l}_i$ and $\mathbf{s}_i$, first couple to form an individual total angular momentum $\mathbf{j}_i = \mathbf{l}_i + \mathbf{s}_i$. Then, these individual $\mathbf{j}_i$ vectors are coupled to form the total atomic angular momentum $\mathbf{J} = \sum_i \mathbf{j}_i$. For most atoms in the middle of the periodic table, neither LS nor [jj-coupling](@entry_id:140838) is perfectly accurate, and a more complex **[intermediate coupling](@entry_id:167774)** model is required.
