Proceed to solution derivation.\n\nThe one-dimensional Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation (TISE) for a particle of mass $m$ and energy $E$ in a potential $V(x)$ is:\n$$-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{d^2\\psi(x)}{dx^2} + V(x)\\psi(x) = E\\psi(x)$$\nThe complex conjugate of this equation is:\n$$-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{d^2\\psi^*(x)}{dx^2} + V^*(x)\\psi^*(x) = E^*\\psi^*(x)$$\nFor a stationary state, the energy $E$ is real ($E^*=E$). The problem states the potential $V(x)$ is real, so $V^*(x)=V(x)$.

The condition under which this holds is that the potential $V(x)$ must be real. If $V(x)$ were complex, a source or sink term $\\frac{2}{\\hbar}\\text{Im}(V)|\\psi|^2$ would appear on the right-hand side.\n\nFor a scattering problem with a localized potential, the asymptotic form of the wavefunction for incidence from the left is:\n$$\\psi(x) = \\begin{cases} e^{ikx} + r e^{-ikx}  x \\to -\\infty \\\\ t e^{ikx}  x \\to +\\infty \\end{cases}$$\nwhere we have set the incident amplitude to $1$, and $k = \\sqrt{2mE}/\\hbar$. The probability current in the region $x \\to -\\infty$ is $j_{left} = j_{inc} + j_{refl} = \\frac{\\hbar k}{m}(1 - |r|^2)$. The current in the region $x \\to +\\infty$ is $j_{right} = j_{trans} = \\frac{\\hbar k}{m}|t|^2$.\nFrom current conservation, $j_{left}=j_{right}$, which gives $1 - |r|^2 = |t|^2$.\nThe reflection and transmission coefficients are defined as $R = |r|^2$ and $T = |t|^2$. Thus, we derive the flux-conservation relation $R+T=1$, which holds for any real, time-independent potential.\n\nFor the delta barrier in Case B, $V(x) = \\lambda\\,\\delta(x)$. The wavefunction is continuous at $x=0$, so $\\psi(0^-) = \\psi(0^+)$, which gives $1+r=t$. The discontinuity in the first derivative is found by integrating the TISE around $x=0$:\n$$\\Delta\\left(\\frac{d\\psi}{dx}\\right)\\bigg|_{x=0} = \\frac{d\\psi}{dx}(0^+) - \\frac{d\\psi}{dx}(0^-) = \\frac{2m\\lambda}{\\hbar^2}\\psi(0)$$\nSubstituting the asymptotic forms yields: $ikt - ik(1-r) = \\frac{2m\\lambda}{\\hbar^2} t$.\nUsing $1+r=t$, this simplifies to $ik(t - 1 + r) = \\frac{2m\\lambda}{\\hbar^2}t$.

The test passes.\n- Case B: Relative error is $\\frac{|T_{\\text{num}} - T_{\\text{analytic}}|}{|T_{\\text{analytic}}|} = \\frac{|0.5004 - 0.5|}{0.5} = \\frac{0.0004}{0.5} = 8 \\times 10^{-4}$. This is less than the tolerance $\\eta = 10^{-3}$. The test passes.\n- Case C: Relative error is $\\frac{|T_{\\text{num}} - T_{\\text{analytic}}|}{|T_{\\text{analytic}}|} = \\frac{|0.88970 - 8/9|}{8/9} = \\frac{|0.88970 - 0.88888...|}{0.88888...} \\approx \\frac{0.000811}{0.88888} \\approx 9.12 \\times 10^{-4}$. This is less than the tolerance $\\eta = 10^{-3}$. The test passes.\nSince all three tests pass, statement A is **Correct**.\n\nB. This statement claims the unitarity test fails because $R+T$ is not exactly $1$. This misunderstands the nature of numerical methods. Discretization of the Schrödinger equation on a grid inevitably introduces small errors. The purpose of a tolerance $\\varepsilon$ is to define an acceptable level of this numerical error. A small deviation like $2 \\times 10^{-6}$ indicates a well-behaved numerical scheme, not a fundamental flaw. The statement is **Incorrect**.\n\nC. The first part of this statement, that the analytic transmission coefficient is $1/2$, is correct as derived above. However, the second part claims the code fails the benchmark because the relative tolerance $\\eta$ is violated. As calculated for statement A, the relative error is $8 \\times 10^{-4}$, which is smaller than $\\eta=10^{-3}$. Thus, the tolerance is satisfied, and the benchmark is passed. The statement's conclusion is false. The statement is **Incorrect**.\n\nD. This statement claims the analytic transmission coefficient in Case C is $8/9$ and that the numerical result is within tolerance. As derived above, $T_{\\text{analytic}} = 8/9$. As calculated for statement A, the relative error is approximately $9.12 \\times 10^{-4}$, which is less than the tolerance $\\eta=10^{-3}$. Both parts of the statement are true. The statement is **Correct**.\n\nE. Complex absorbing boundary layers or potentials are, by design, non-Hermitian additions to the Hamiltonian, introducing a negative imaginary part to the potential, i.e., $\\text{Im}(V)  0$. As shown in the derivation of current conservation, a non-real potential leads to $\\frac{dj}{dx} \\neq 0$. Specifically, an absorbing potential causes probability to be removed from the system, so $R+T  1$. Thus, the check $R+T=1$ is indeed inapplicable. However, the statement concludes that one \"cannot validate via flux conservation in any configuration.\" This is too strong and false. A physicist would first validate the core solver for a real potential (where $R+T=1$ must hold to tolerance) on a large grid, and only then add and validate the absorbing boundary layers as a separate feature. The flux conservation law is a primary validation tool for the Hermitian part of the problem. The statement is therefore **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AD}$$", "id": "2909738"}]}
