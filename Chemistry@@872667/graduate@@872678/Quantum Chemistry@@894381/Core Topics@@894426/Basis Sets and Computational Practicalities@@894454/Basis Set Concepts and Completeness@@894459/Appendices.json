It presents a standard, verifiable set of tasks in the field of quantum chemistry and linear algebra, with all necessary data and definitions provided. Therefore, we proceed with the solution.\n\na) The overlap matrix $\\mathbf{S}$ is a Gram matrix, with elements $S_{ij} = \\langle \\chi_i \\mid \\chi_j \\rangle$. Since the basis functions are elements of a Hilbert space, the inner product $\\langle \\cdot \\mid \\cdot \\rangle$ ensures that $\\mathbf{S}$ is Hermitian (or symmetric for real basis functions) and positive semi-definite. For a linearly independent basis set, $\\mathbf{S}$ is positive definite.\n\nThe Rayleigh-Ritz principle states that for a Hermitian matrix $\\mathbf{A}$, its smallest eigenvalue $\\lambda_{\\min}(\\mathbf{A})$ is given by the minimum of the Rayleigh quotient:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\min}(\\mathbf{A}) = \\min_{\\mathbf{x}\\neq\\mathbf{0}} \\frac{\\mathbf{x}^\\dagger \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{x}}{\\mathbf{x}^\\dagger \\mathbf{x}}\n$$\nWe apply this principle to the overlap matrix $\\mathbf{S}$ with a coefficient vector $\\mathbf{c} \\in \\mathbb{C}^{N}$, whose elements are $\\{c_i\\}_{i=1}^{N}$. The Rayleigh quotient for $\\mathbf{S}$ is $\\frac{\\mathbf{c}^\\dagger \\mathbf{S} \\mathbf{c}}{\\mathbf{c}^\\dagger \\mathbf{c}}$.\n\nLet us analyze the numerator, $\\mathbf{c}^\\dagger \\mathbf{S} \\mathbf{c}$. By definition of matrix multiplication, this is $\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} c_i^* S_{ij} c_j$.

Let us define a function $\\psi$ as a linear combination of the basis functions: $\\psi = \\sum_{j=1}^{N} c_j \\chi_j$. The squared norm of this function, $\\|\\psi\\|^2$, is given by the inner product $\\langle \\psi \\mid \\psi \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\|\\psi\\|^2 = \\left\\langle \\sum_{i=1}^{N} c_i \\chi_i \\;\\middle|\\; \\sum_{j=1}^{N} c_j \\chi_j \\right\\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} c_i^* c_j \\langle \\chi_i \\mid \\chi_j \\rangle = \\mathbf{c}^\\dagger \\mathbf{S} \\mathbf{c}\n$$\nThe denominator of the Rayleigh quotient is $\\mathbf{c}^\\dagger \\mathbf{c} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} c_i^* c_i$, which is the squared Euclidean norm of the coefficient vector, $\\|\\mathbf{c}\\|^2$.\n\nBy direct substitution, the Rayleigh quotient for $\\mathbf{S}$ becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathbf{c}^\\dagger \\mathbf{S} \\mathbf{c}}{\\mathbf{c}^\\dagger \\mathbf{c}} = \\frac{\\left\\|\\sum_{i=1}^{N} c_i \\chi_i\\right\\|^2}{\\|\\mathbf{c}\\|^2}\n$$\nThe Rayleigh-Ritz principle then gives the smallest eigenvalue of $\\mathbf{S}$ as the minimum of this expression over all non-zero coefficient vectors $\\mathbf{c}$:\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\min}(\\mathbf{S}) = \\min_{\\mathbf{c}\\neq\\mathbf{0}} \\frac{\\left\\|\\sum_{i=1}^{N} c_i \\chi_i\\right\\|^2}{\\|\\mathbf{c}\\|^2}\n$$\nThis completes the proof.\n\nNow, for the physical interpretation. A near redundancy or near linear dependence in the basis set $\\{\\chi_i\\}_{i=1}^{N}$ means that there exists a set of coefficients $\\{c_i\\}$, not all zero, such that the linear combination $\\psi = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} c_i \\chi_i$ is nearly the zero function. In terms of the norm, this means we can find a vector $\\mathbf{c}$ with $\\|\\mathbf{c}\\|  0$ (for instance, we can normalize it such that $\\|\\mathbf{c}\\|^2=1$) for which $\\|\\psi\\|^2 = \\|\\sum_{i=1}^{N} c_i \\chi_i\\|^2$ is a very small positive number, $\\epsilon \\approx 0$.\nAccording to the derived formula for $\\lambda_{\\min}(\\mathbf{S})$, the minimum value of the ratio $\\frac{\\|\\psi\\|^2}{\\|\\mathbf{c}\\|^2}$ must be at least as small as this value $\\epsilon$. Therefore, the existence of such a near-vanishing linear combination forces $\\lambda_{\\min}(\\mathbf{S})$ to be close to zero. The approach to completeness through adding more functions eventually introduces such near-redundancies, which manifests as the overlap matrix having very small eigenvalues.\n\nb) We are given two normalized Gaussian functions in $L^2(\\mathbb{R})$:\n$$\n\\chi_{1}(x) = \\mathcal{N}\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha x^{2}}{2}\\right), \\quad \\chi_{2}(x) = \\mathcal{N}\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha (x-\\delta)^{2}}{2}\\right)\n$$\nwith $\\mathcal{N} = (\\alpha/\\pi)^{1/4}$.

This evaluates to $\\sqrt{\\pi/\\alpha}$.\n$$\ns(\\alpha, \\delta) = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha}{\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha\\delta^2}{4}\\right) \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{\\alpha}} = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha\\delta^2}{4}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the exact expression for the overlap.\n\nc) For the $N=2$ case, the basis functions are normalized, so $\\langle \\chi_1 \\mid \\chi_1 \\rangle = 1$ and $\\langle \\chi_2 \\mid \\chi_2 \\rangle = 1$. The off-diagonal elements are $\\langle \\chi_1 \\mid \\chi_2 \\rangle = \\langle \\chi_2 \\mid \\chi_1 \\rangle = s(\\alpha, \\delta) = s$. The overlap matrix is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{S} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  s \\\\ s  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nTo find the eigenvalues $\\lambda$, we solve the characteristic equation $\\det(\\mathbf{S} - \\lambda\\mathbf{I}) = 0$:\n$$\n\\det\\begin{pmatrix} 1-\\lambda  s \\\\ s  1-\\lambda \\end{pmatrix} = (1-\\lambda)^2 - s^2 = 0\n$$\nThis gives $(1-\\lambda-s)(1-\\lambda+s) = 0$. The eigenvalues are therefore $\\lambda_1 = 1+s$ and $\\lambda_2 = 1-s$.\nSince $\\alpha  0$ and $\\delta  0$, we have $s = \\exp(-\\alpha\\delta^2/4)$, which implies $0  s  1$. Thus, the eigenvalues are both positive.\nThe largest eigenvalue is $\\lambda_{\\max}(\\mathbf{S}) = 1+s$, and the smallest is $\\lambda_{\\min}(\\mathbf{S}) = 1-s$.\nThe spectral condition number $\\kappa_2(\\mathbf{S})$ is the ratio of the largest to the smallest eigenvalue:\n$$\n\\kappa_2(\\mathbf{S}) = \\frac{\\lambda_{\\max}(\\mathbf{S})}{\\lambda_{\\min}(\\mathbf{S})} = \\frac{1+s}{1-s}\n$$\nSubstituting the expression for $s(\\alpha, \\delta)$:\n$$\n\\kappa_2(\\mathbf{S}) = \\frac{1 + \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha\\delta^2}{4}\\right)}{1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\alpha\\delta^2}{4}\\right)}\n$$\nNow we analyze the behavior as $\\delta \\to 0$. As $\\delta$ approaches $0$, the exponent $-\\frac{\\alpha\\delta^2}{4}$ approaches $0$, and thus $s = \\exp(-\\frac{\\alpha\\delta^2}{4})$ approaches $\\exp(0) = 1$.\nPhysically, $\\delta \\to 0$ means $\\chi_2(x) \\to \\chi_1(x)$, and the two basis functions become identical, i.e., linearly dependent. Their overlap $s$ correctly approaches $1$.\nIn this limit, the condition number behaves as:\n$$\n\\lim_{\\delta\\to 0} \\kappa_2(\\mathbf{S}) = \\lim_{s\\to 1^{-}} \\frac{1+s}{1-s} = \\frac{2}{0^{+}} = \\infty\n$$\nAn infinite or very large condition number signifies that the matrix $\\mathbf{S}$ is singular or ill-conditioned.

For an ill-conditioned matrix, these numerical procedures are highly unstable. Small numerical errors in the elements of $\\mathbf{S}$ are magnified enormously during inversion or factorization, leading to large, unreliable errors in the computed eigenvalues $\\epsilon$ and eigenvectors $\\mathbf{c}$.

We can multiply both sides by $r^{\\ell}$ and move it inside the integral, as it is independent of the integration variable $t$:\n$$\nr^{\\ell} e^{-\\zeta r} = \\int_0^\\infty \\left( \\frac{\\zeta}{2\\sqrt{\\pi}} t^{-3/2} e^{-\\zeta^2/(4t)} \\right) \\left( r^{\\ell} e^{-t r^2} \\right) dt.\n$$\nThis expresses the STO radial factor $R_{\\mathrm{STO}}(r) = r^{\\ell} e^{-\\zeta r}$ as a continuous linear combination of GTO radial factors $R_{\\mathrm{GTO},t}(r) = r^{\\ell} e^{-t r^2}$. The term in the first parenthesis is a weight function, $W(t) = \\frac{\\zeta}{2\\sqrt{\\pi}} t^{-3/2} e^{-\\zeta^2/(4t)}$, which is strictly positive for all $t  0$.\n\nThe second part of the statement concerns approximating this integral by a quadrature rule. A numerical quadrature approximates an integral $\\int_0^\\infty W(t) f(t) dt$ by a weighted sum $\\sum_{k=1}^n w_k f(t_k)$. In our case, the function $f(t)$ is the GTO radial factor $R_{\\mathrm{GTO},t}(r)$. The quadrature approximation of the STO radial factor is thus:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{STO}}(r) \\approx \\sum_{k=1}^n w_k \\left( r^{\\ell} e^{-t_k r^2} \\right).\n$$\nThis is precisely an STO–$n$G type approximation with coefficients $c_k = w_k$ and exponents $\\alpha_k = t_k$.\n\nStandard theorems of numerical analysis state that for a well-behaved integrand, a sequence of quadrature approximations with an increasing number of nodes $n$ converges to the exact value of the integral. When the integrand is a function in a Hilbert space (as here), this procedure leads to convergence in the norm of that space, provided the quadrature nodes and weights are chosen appropriately (e.g., using a scheme that becomes dense in the support of the weight function). This method is, in fact, a cornerstone of how STO-nG basis sets are constructed, and their convergence in the space $L^2(\\mathbb{R}^3)$ is a well-established fact. The set of GTOs with exponents $\\alpha \\in (0, \\infty)$ is complete for functions of this type.\n\nTherefore, the statement is a correct description of a valid and known mathematical procedure.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Statement B**\n\nThis statement claims that the inability of GTOs to reproduce the derivative cusp of an $s$-type STO at the origin prevents convergence in the $L^2$ norm.\n\nLet us examine the derivatives at the origin ($r=0$) for $s$-type orbitals ($\\ell=0$):\nThe radial part of an $s$-type STO is $R_{\\mathrm{STO}}(r) = e^{-\\zeta r}$. Its derivative is $R'_{\\mathrm{STO}}(r) = -\\zeta e^{-\\zeta r}$. At the origin, $R'_{\\mathrm{STO}}(0) = -\\zeta$, which is non-zero (the cusp).\nThe radial part of an $s$-type GTO is $R_{\\mathrm{GTO}}(r) = e^{-\\alpha r^2}$. Its derivative is $R'_{\\mathrm{GTO}}(r) = -2\\alpha r e^{-\\alpha r^2}$. At the origin, $R'_{\\mathrm{GTO}}(0) = 0$.\nAny finite linear combination of $s$-type GTOs, $\\phi_n(r) = \\sum_{k=1}^n c_k e^{-\\alpha_k r^2}$, will also have a zero derivative at the origin: $\\phi'_n(0) = \\sum_{k=1}^n c_k (0) = 0$.\n\nThe premise is correct: no finite linear combination of $s$-type GTOs can reproduce the cusp of an $s$-type STO. This implies that the sequence of approximations does not converge uniformly in the first derivative (i.e., it does not converge in stronger norms like the Sobolev $H^1$ norm, at least not without issues).\n\nHowever, the conclusion that this prevents convergence in the $L^2$ norm is a non-sequitur. The $L^2$ norm is defined by an integral: $\\|\\psi\\|_2^2 = \\int |\\psi|^2 d^3\\mathbf{r}$. The value of a function or its derivative at a single point (a set of measure zero) has no influence on the value of its $L^2$ norm. Convergence in $L^2$ (or \"mean-square convergence\") is a much weaker condition than uniform convergence of the function and its derivatives. It is a fundamental result of functional analysis that the set of Gaussian functions is complete in $L^2(\\mathbb{R}^3)$. This means that any function in $L^2(\\mathbb{R}^3)$, including an STO, can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy in the $L^2$ norm by a linear combination of GTOs. The failure to match the cusp condition is a known practical limitation that slows the convergence of certain properties (like the energy), but it does not preclude convergence of the wavefunction in the $L^2$ norm.\n\nTherefore, the statement makes a logically invalid inference.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Analysis of Statement C**\n\nThis statement applies the Rayleigh–Ritz variational principle to the problem of approximating a quantum eigenstate.\n\nThe statement specifies several conditions:\n1.  The approximation spaces are nested: $V_n = \\mathrm{span}\\{\\chi_1, \\dots, \\chi_n\\}$ and $V_{n+1} = \\mathrm{span}\\{\\chi_1, \\dots, \\chi_{n+1}\\}$, so $V_n \\subset V_{n+1}$.\n2.  The target is the \"exact eigenvalue associated with the STO target\" for a one-electron Hamiltonian. An STO with appropriate parameters is an exact eigenfunction of the hydrogenic Hamiltonian, $H = -\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^2 - Z/r$. So, the \"STO target\" is an eigenfunction of $H$, and the \"exact eigenvalue\" is the corresponding energy.\n3.  The calculation is a Rayleigh-Ritz variational one.\n\nThe Rayleigh-Ritz variational principle states that for any normalized trial function $\\psi_{\\text{trial}}$ that is not the true ground state eigenfunction, the expectation value of the energy is an upper bound to the true ground state energy $E_0$: $\\langle \\psi_{\\text{trial}}|H|\\psi_{\\text{trial}} \\rangle \\ge E_0$. When applied to a sequence of nested trial spaces $V_1 \\subset V_2 \\subset \\dots$, the calculated ground state energies $E_1 \\ge E_2 \\ge \\dots$ form a monotonically non-increasing sequence. More generally, the Hylleraas-Undheim-MacDonald theorem guarantees that all approximate eigenvalues obtained from such a procedure converge monotonically from above to the respective exact eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian $H$.\n\nAs established in the analyses of A and B, the set of all GTOs is complete in $L^2(\\mathbb{R}^3)$. This ensures that as the basis set is systematically enlarged (e.g., by adding new primitives to create nested spaces), the basis can approximate the true STO eigenfunction with increasing accuracy. Consequently, the variational energies must converge to the exact eigenvalues. The mismatch in cusp behavior or asymptotic decay ($e^{-\\alpha r^2}$ vs. $e^{-\\zeta r}$) are practical issues that affect the *rate* of convergence, but they do not violate the fundamental principle of monotonic convergence from above.\n\nTherefore, the statement is a correct application of the variational principle in quantum mechanics.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Analysis of Statement D**\n\nThis statement addresses the necessity of expanding the set of exponents to achieve convergence.\n\nLet a fixed, finite set of $p$ Gaussian exponents be $\\{\\alpha_1, \\dots, \\alpha_p\\}$. The corresponding primitives span a finite-dimensional vector space $V_p = \\mathrm{span}\\{\\chi_{\\alpha_1}, \\dots, \\chi_{\\alpha_p}\\}$. This space is a closed subspace of the Hilbert space $L^2(\\mathbb{R}^3)$.\nAny convergent sequence of functions $\\{\\psi_n\\}$ where every $\\psi_n \\in V_p$ must have its limit also in $V_p$.\n\nA nontrivial STO, $\\phi_{\\mathrm{STO}}$, cannot be written as a finite linear combination of GTOs, as they have fundamentally different functional forms (e.g., $e^{-\\zeta r}$ vs. $e^{-\\alpha r^2}$). Therefore, $\\phi_{\\mathrm{STO}}$ is not an element of $V_p$.\nConsequently, no sequence of approximations drawn from the fixed, finite space $V_p$ can converge in the $L^2$ norm to $\\phi_{\\mathrm{STO}}$. The best one can do is find the orthogonal projection of $\\phi_{\\mathrm{STO}}$ onto $V_p$, but the error, represented by the norm of the difference, will be non-zero. The phrasing \"as $n$ increases\" is slightly clumsy but the context implies that if the pool of primitives is fixed to $p$ functions, no amount of optimization of the linear coefficients $c_k$ for a combination of $n \\le p$ primitives can lead to convergence to a function outside the space spanned by those $p$ primitives.\n\nTo achieve true convergence (i.e., making the error $\\| \\phi_n - \\phi_{\\mathrm{STO}} \\|_2$ approach zero), the sequence of approximation spaces $V_n$ must \"fill\" the larger space in a way that the distance from $\\phi_{\\mathrm{STO}}$ to the space $V_n$ goes to zero. This requires the basis set to become complete in the limit $n \\to \\infty$. For GTOs, this is achieved by continuously adding new primitives with new exponents, such that the set of all exponents used, $\\cup_n \\{\\alpha_1, \\dots, \\alpha_n\\}$, becomes a dense set in $(0, \\infty)$. The statement correctly concludes that to achieve convergence, \"the exponent set itself must be enriched beyond a fixed finite set.\"\n\nTherefore, this statement correctly captures a fundamental requirement for basis set convergence.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "2875243"}, {"introduction": "Theoretical concepts like basis set deficiencies become far more intuitive through direct computational investigation.

It presents a standard, well-posed exercise in computational quantum chemistry, grounded in the fundamental principles of the variational method and basis set theory. All necessary parameters and definitions are provided, allowing for a unique and verifiable numerical solution. The objective is to quantify the error introduced by using Gaussian-Type Orbitals (GTOs), which inherently lack the electron-nuclear cusp present in the exact solutions of the Schrödinger equation for atomic systems.\n\nThe theoretical framework is the time-independent Schrödinger equation, $H\\psi = E\\psi$, for a single electron in the central Coulomb potential $V(r) = -Z/r$ of a nucleus with charge $Z$. In atomic units, the Hamiltonian operator is $H = T + V = -\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^2 - \\frac{Z}{r}$. The ground state wavefunction is approximated as a linear combination of basis functions, $\\psi_G(r)$, as dictated by the variational principle. This principle guarantees that the expectation value of the energy for any trial wavefunction is an upper bound to the true ground-state energy, $E_G = \\frac{\\langle \\psi_G | H | \\psi_G \\rangle}{\\langle \\psi_G | \\psi_G \\rangle} \\ge E_{\\mathrm{ex}}$.\n\nWe employ an even-tempered basis set of $n$ co-centered $s$-type GTOs:\n$$\n\\psi_{G}(r) = \\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} c_{k} \\, \\phi_k(r)\n$$\nwhere the primitive Gaussian functions $\\phi_k(r)$ are given by:\n$$\n\\phi_k(r) = \\mathcal{N}(\\alpha_k) e^{-\\alpha_k r^2} \\quad \\text{with} \\quad \\alpha_k = \\alpha_0 \\beta^k\n$$\nThe factor $\\mathcal{N}(\\alpha_k) = \\left(\\frac{2\\alpha_k}{\\pi}\\right)^{3/4}$ ensures that each primitive is normalized to unity, $\\langle \\phi_k | \\phi_k \\rangle = 1$. Minimizing the energy functional with respect to the linear coefficients $\\{c_k\\}$ leads to the generalized eigenvalue problem, also known as the Roothaan-Hall equations:\n$$\nH \\mathbf{c} = E S \\mathbf{c}\n$$\nwhere $H$ is the Hamiltonian matrix, $S$ is the overlap matrix, $\\mathbf{c}$ is the column vector of coefficients $c_k$, and $E$ is the energy eigenvalue. The matrix elements are defined as $S_{ij} = \\langle \\phi_i | \\phi_j \\rangle$ and $H_{ij} = \\langle \\phi_i | H | \\phi_j \\rangle = T_{ij} + V_{ij}$.\n\nFrom first principles, using standard three-dimensional Gaussian integrals in spherical coordinates, we derive the matrix elements for two normalized, co-centered $s$-type GTOs $\\phi_i$ and $\\phi_j$ with exponents $\\alpha_i$ and $\\alpha_j$:\n\n$1$. **Overlap Matrix $S$**:\nThe overlap integral is given by:\n$$\nS_{ij} = \\langle \\phi_i | \\phi_j \\rangle = \\int \\phi_i^*(r) \\phi_j(r) d^3\\mathbf{r} = \\left(\\frac{4\\alpha_i \\alpha_j}{(\\alpha_i+\\alpha_j)^2}\\right)^{3/4}\n$$\nThis formula is derived from the standard integral $\\int_0^\\infty r^2 e^{-ar^2} dr = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{4a^{3/2}}$. When $i=j$, $S_{ii}=1$, as required for normalized basis functions.\n\n$2$. **Kinetic Energy Matrix $T$**:\nThe kinetic energy element $T_{ij} = \\langle \\phi_i | -\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^2 | \\phi_j \\rangle$ is most conveniently evaluated using the relation $T_{ij} = \\frac{1}{2}\\int (\\nabla \\phi_i) \\cdot (\\nabla \\phi_j) d^3\\mathbf{r}$. This leads to the compact expression:\n$$\nT_{ij} = \\frac{3\\alpha_i\\alpha_j}{\\alpha_i+\\alpha_j} S_{ij}\n$$\n\n$3$. **Nuclear Attraction Matrix $V$**:\nThe potential energy element $V_{ij} = \\langle \\phi_i | -Z/r | \\phi_j \\rangle$ evaluates to:\n$$\nV_{ij} = \\mathcal{N}_i \\mathcal{N}_j \\int_0^\\infty e^{-(\\alpha_i+\\alpha_j)r^2} \\left(-\\frac{Z}{r}\\right) 4\\pi r^2 dr = - \\frac{2\\pi Z \\mathcal{N}_i \\mathcal{N}_j}{\\alpha_i+\\alpha_j}\n= -\\frac{2Z}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\frac{(4\\alpha_i\\alpha_j)^{3/4}}{\\alpha_i+\\alpha_j}\n$$\n\nWith these matrices, we solve $H\\mathbf{c} = E S \\mathbf{c}$ for the lowest eigenvalue $E_0$ and the corresponding eigenvector $\\mathbf{c}_0$, which is normalized such that $\\mathbf{c}_0^\\top S \\mathbf{c}_0 = 1$. The diagnostics are then calculated:\n\n$1$. **Kinetic Energy Error $\\Delta T$**: The kinetic energy of the GTO wavefunction is $T_G = \\mathbf{c}_0^\\top T \\mathbf{c}_0$. The exact value for a hydrogenic system is given by the virial theorem as $T_{\\mathrm{ex}} = -E_{\\mathrm{ex}} = Z^2/2$. The error is $\\Delta T = T_G - T_{\\mathrm{ex}}$. The GTO wavefunction, being excessively smooth at the nucleus ($d\\psi_G/dr|_{r=0}=0$), fails to reproduce the sharp cusp of the exact wavefunction, which has a divergent local kinetic energy at $r=0$. This deficiency is expected to manifest in the total kinetic energy expectation value, particularly for well-converged basis sets.\n\n$2$. **Near-Nuclear Density Deviation $\\Delta \\rho_{\\mathrm{core}}$**: This metric quantifies the misrepresentation of the electron probability density near the nucleus. It is the integrated absolute difference between the GTO density $\\rho_G(r) = |\\psi_G(r)|^2$ and the exact density $\\rho_{\\mathrm{ex}}(r) = (Z^3/\\pi)e^{-2Zr}$, within a small sphere of radius $r_c$:\n$$\n\\Delta \\rho_{\\mathrm{core}} = \\int_{0}^{r_{c}} \\left| \\rho_{G}(r) - \\rho_{\\mathrm{ex}}(r) \\right| 4 \\pi r^{2} \\, dr\n$$\nThis integral is computed using numerical quadrature.\n\nThe computational procedure is as follows:\nFor each test case, we generate the exponents $\\alpha_k$. We then construct the symmetric matrices $S$, $T$, and $V$ of size $n \\times n$. The Hamiltonian $H = T+V$ is formed. The generalized eigenvalue problem is solved using a standard library routine (`scipy.linalg.eigh`), yielding the set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The lowest eigenvalue and its associated eigenvector define the ground state approximation. Using this eigenvector, $T_G$ is computed. Finally, the integral for $\\Delta\\rho_{\\mathrm{core}}$ is evaluated numerically.
