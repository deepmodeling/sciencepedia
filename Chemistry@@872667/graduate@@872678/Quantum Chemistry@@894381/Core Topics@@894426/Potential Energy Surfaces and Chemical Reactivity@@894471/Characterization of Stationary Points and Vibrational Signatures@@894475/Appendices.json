This practice provides a hands-on mathematical tour of how stationary points—minima and transition states—are located and characterized from first principles. By working through the analytical solution for a model 2D potential, you will replicate the fundamental computational workflow: setting the gradient to zero to find candidate points, and then analyzing the Hessian matrix at each point to determine its nature. This exercise reinforces the deep connection between the local topography of the PES and the vibrational signatures used to identify stable molecules and reaction pathways [@problem_id:2878644].", "problem": "In the Born–Oppenheimer approximation (BOA), local reactivity and vibrational signatures of a molecular configuration are inferred by characterizing stationary points of a Potential Energy Surface (PES).

No rounding is needed; the final answer is dimensionless and must be exact.", "solution": "The problem is valid as it is scientifically grounded in the principles of potential energy surface analysis, well-posed with a clear objective and sufficient data, and objective in its formulation. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe potential energy surface (PES) is given by the function $E(x,y) = x^{4} + y^{4} - 2 x^{2} + x y$.\n\nTo find the stationary points, we must find the points $(x,y)$ where the gradient of the energy, $\\nabla E(x,y)$, is the zero vector. The components of the gradient are the partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial x} = 4x^{3} - 4x + y\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial y} = 4y^{3} + x\n$$\nSetting both partial derivatives to zero gives the system of equations for the stationary points:\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n4x^{3} - 4x + y = 0  (1) \\\\\n4y^{3} + x = 0  (2)\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nFrom equation (2), we can express $x$ in terms of $y$: $x = -4y^{3}$. Substituting this expression for $x$ into equation (1):\n$$\n4(-4y^{3})^{3} - 4(-4y^{3}) + y = 0\n$$\n$$\n4(-64y^{9}) + 16y^{3} + y = 0\n$$\n$$\n-256y^{9} + 16y^{3} + y = 0\n$$\nFactoring out $y$, we obtain:\n$$\ny(-256y^{8} + 16y^{2} + 1) = 0\n$$\nOne solution is immediately apparent: $y=0$. Substituting $y=0$ into $x = -4y^{3}$ gives $x=0$. Thus, one stationary point is $P_0 = (0,0)$.\n\nThe other solutions for $y$ must satisfy the equation $-256y^{8} + 16y^{2} + 1 = 0$. Let $w = y^{2}$. Since $y$ is real, $w$ must be non-negative. The equation becomes a quartic in $w$:\n$$\n256w^{4} - 16w - 1 = 0\n$$\nLet's analyze the real roots of $f(w) = 256w^{4} - 16w - 1$ for $w  0$. The derivative is $f'(w) = 1024w^{3} - 16$. Setting $f'(w)=0$ gives $w^{3} = 16/1024 = 1/64$, which implies $w = 1/4$. This is a critical point. The second derivative is $f''(w) = 3072w^2$, which is positive for $w0$, confirming that $w=1/4$ is a local minimum.\nThe value of the function at this minimum is $f(1/4) = 256(1/4)^{4} - 16(1/4) - 1 = 1 - 4 - 1 = -4$.\nAt $w=0$, $f(0) = -1$. As $w \\to \\infty$, $f(w) \\to \\infty$.\nSince $f(w)$ decreases from $f(0)=-1$ to a minimum of $-4$ at $w=1/4$ and then increases monotonically to $+\\infty$, by the Intermediate Value Theorem, there exists exactly one positive real root, which we denote $w_0$.\nThis unique positive root $w_0$ gives two real values for $y$: $y = \\pm\\sqrt{w_0}$.\nFor each of these $y$ values, we find the corresponding $x$ value using $x = -4y^{3}$:\nIf $y = \\sqrt{w_0}$, then $x = -4(\\sqrt{w_0})^{3} = -4w_0^{3/2}$.\nIf $y = -\\sqrt{w_0}$, then $x = -4(-\\sqrt{w_0})^{3} = 4w_0^{3/2}$.\nThese give two additional stationary points, $P_1 = (-4w_0^{3/2}, \\sqrt{w_0})$ and $P_2 = (4w_0^{3/2}, -\\sqrt{w_0})$. Note that $P_2 = -P_1$, which is consistent with the inversion symmetry of the PES, $E(-x,-y) = E(x,y)$.\nIn total, there are three distinct real stationary points.\n\nNext, we characterize these stationary points using the Hessian matrix, $H(x,y)$. The second partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial x^2} = 12x^2 - 4\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial y^2} = 12y^2\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial x \\partial y} = 1\n$$\nThe Hessian matrix is:\n$$\nH(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} 12x^2 - 4  1 \\\\ 1  12y^2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe signs of the eigenvalues are determined by the signs of the determinant, $\\det(H)$, and the trace, $\\mathrm{Tr}(H)$.\nFor $P_0 = (0,0)$:\n$$\nH(0,0) = \\begin{pmatrix} -4  1 \\\\ 1  0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\n$$\n\\det(H(0,0)) = (-4)(0) - (1)(1) = -1\n$$\nA negative determinant implies the eigenvalues have opposite signs (one positive, one negative). Therefore, the Morse index (number of negative eigenvalues) for $P_0$ is $1$. This point is a first-order saddle point.\n\nFor $P_1$ and $P_2$, the Hessian depends only on $x^{2}$ and $y^{2}$.\n$x^2 = (\\pm 4w_0^{3/2})^2 = 16w_0^3$.\n$y^2 = (\\pm \\sqrt{w_0})^2 = w_0$.\nSo the Hessian matrix is identical for both points:\n$$\nH(P_{1,2}) = \\begin{pmatrix} 12(16w_0^3) - 4  1 \\\\ 1  12w_0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 192w_0^3 - 4  1 \\\\ 1  12w_0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe determinant is $\\det(H) = (192w_0^3 - 4)(12w_0) - 1 = 2304w_0^4 - 48w_0 - 1$.\nFrom the definition of $w_0$, we have $256w_0^4 - 16w_0 - 1 = 0$, which implies $256w_0^4 = 16w_0 + 1$.\nThus, $w_0^4 = \\frac{16w_0 + 1}{256}$. Substituting this into the determinant expression:\n$$\n\\det(H) = 2304\\left(\\frac{16w_0 + 1}{256}\\right) - 48w_0 - 1 = 9(16w_0 + 1) - 48w_0 - 1\n$$\n$$\n\\det(H) = 144w_0 + 9 - 48w_0 - 1 = 96w_0 + 8\n$$\nSince $w_0$ is a positive root, $\\det(H) = 96w_0 + 8  0$. The eigenvalues have the same sign.\nThe trace of the Hessian is $\\mathrm{Tr}(H) = (192w_0^3 - 4) + 12w_0$.\nAs established, the minimum of $f(w)$ for $w0$ is at $w=1/4$, and $w_0$ is the root where $f(w_0)=0$. Thus, $w_0  1/4$.\nSo, $\\mathrm{Tr}(H)  192(1/4)^3 + 12(1/4) - 4 = 192/64 + 3 - 4 = 3 + 3 - 4 = 2$.\nSince $\\mathrm{Tr}(H)  0$ and $\\det(H)  0$, both eigenvalues are positive. The Morse index for both $P_1$ and $P_2$ is $0$. These points are local minima.\n\nFinally, we order the stationary points by their energy $E(x,y)$.\nFor $P_0 = (0,0)$, the energy is $E(0,0) = 0$.\nFor $P_1$ and $P_2$, we can simplify the energy expression using the stationary conditions. Multiplying equation (2) by $y$ gives $4y^4 + xy = 0$, so $xy = -4y^4$.\nSubstitute this into the energy expression:\n$E = x^4 + y^4 - 2x^2 + xy = x^4 + y^4 - 2x^2 - 4y^4 = x^4 - 3y^4 - 2x^2$.\nFrom $xy = -4y^4$ and $x \\ne 0$, $y \\ne 0$ at these points, we can also use $x(\\partial E/\\partial x)=0 \\implies 4x^4 - 4x^2 + xy = 0$. Using $xy=-4y^4$, we get $4x^4 - 4x^2 - 4y^4 = 0$, which simplifies to $y^4 = x^4 - x^2$.\nSubstitute this back into the simplified energy expression:\n$E = x^4 - 3(x^4 - x^2) - 2x^2 = x^4 - 3x^4 + 3x^2 - 2x^2 = -2x^4 + x^2 = x^2(1 - 2x^2)$.\nWe need to determine the sign of this energy. This depends on whether $x^2$ is greater or less than $1/2$.\n$x^2 = 16w_0^3$. The condition $x^2  1/2$ is equivalent to $16w_0^3  1/2$, or $w_0^3  1/32$.\nLet $w_c = (1/32)^{1/3}$. Let us evaluate $f(w_c) = 256w_c^4 - 16w_c - 1$.\n$f(w_c) = 256(w_c^3)w_c - 16w_c - 1 = 256(1/32)w_c - 16w_c - 1 = 8w_c - 16w_c - 1 = -8w_c - 1$.\nSince $w_c  0$, $f(w_c)  0$.\nThe function $f(w)$ is increasing for $w  1/4$. We can verify $w_c = (1/32)^{1/3}  1/4$ since $(1/32)  (1/64) = (1/4)^3$.\nSince $f(w_c)  0$ and $f(w_0) = 0$, and $f(w)$ is increasing in the region containing $w_c$ and $w_0$, we must have $w_0  w_c$.\nThis implies $w_0^3  w_c^3 = 1/32$, so $x^2 = 16w_0^3  16(1/32) = 1/2$.\nSince $x^2  1/2$, the term $(1 - 2x^2)$ is negative. Thus, the energy $E(P_{1,2}) = x^2(1 - 2x^2)$ is negative.\nThe energies are ordered as $E(P_1) = E(P_2)  0 = E(P_0)$.\nThe stationary points ordered by increasing energy are the two minima, $P_1$ and $P_2$ (which are degenerate), followed by the saddle point $P_0$.\nThe corresponding Morse indices are $0$ for $P_1$, $0$ for $P_2$, and $1$ for $P_0$.\nThe ordered triple of Morse indices is $(0, 0, 1)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0  0  1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2878644"}, {"introduction": "In an ideal world, the sign of the Hessian eigenvalues provides an unambiguous classification of a stationary point.

The characterization of stationary points on a potential energy surface (PES), the use of gradients and Hessians, the concept of imaginary frequencies, and the distinction between true transition states and numerical artifacts are all central to the study of chemical reaction mechanisms. All premises are factually and scientifically sound.\n- **Well-Posedness:** The question is well-posed. It asks for a definitive procedural test to distinguish between two clearly defined physical situations (a true saddle point versus a shallow minimum). A unique and correct protocol exists based on established theoretical chemistry principles.\n- **Objectivity:** The problem is stated in precise, objective, technical language, free from ambiguity or subjective claims.\n- **Completeness and Consistency:** The problem is self-contained. It provides all necessary context: a candidate structure, its gradient and Hessian properties, the existence of known minima, and the specific theoretical principles to be used. There are no internal contradictions.\n- **Realism:** The scenario is highly realistic. A low-magnitude imaginary frequency (on the order of $10-50\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$) is a frequent occurrence in geometry optimizations and requires careful post-analysis. The given gradient norm threshold is also typical for high-accuracy calculations.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is **valid**. It is a well-formulated, scientifically sound, and non-trivial problem in theoretical chemistry. I will proceed to derive the solution.\n\n### Solution and Option Analysis\n\nThe core of the problem is to establish a rigorous procedure to confirm the identity of a stationary point, $\\mathbf{Q}_0$, which formally has an index of one (one negative eigenvalue $\\lambda_1$ in its mass-weighted Hessian $\\mathbf{H}$), but where this negative eigenvalue is small in magnitude. A true first-order saddle point, or transition state (TS), is not merely defined by its index; it is functionally defined as the maximum-energy point along the minimum-energy path connecting a reactant and a product. The ambiguity arises because numerical errors in the computed energy derivatives can arteficially create a small negative curvature where the true curvature is small and positive (a shallow minimum).\n\nBased on the provided principles:\n\n1.  From principle (iv), the structure $\\mathbf{Q}_0$ is a candidate first-order saddle point because its Hessian has one negative eigenvalue, $\\lambda_1$.\n\n2.  From principle (iii), the potential energy change upon a small displacement $\\delta\\mathbf{e}_1$ along the eigenvector corresponding to $\\lambda_1$ is given by $V(\\mathbf{Q}_0 + \\delta\\mathbf{e}_1) - V(\\mathbf{Q}_0) \\approx \\frac{1}{2}\\delta^2 \\mathbf{e}_1^\\top\\mathbf{H}\\mathbf{e}_1 = \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda_1\\delta^2$. Since $\\lambda_1  0$, the energy must decrease for displacements in both the $+\\mathbf{e}_1$ and $-\\mathbf{e}_1$ directions. This confirms that $\\mathbf{Q}_0$ is a maximum along the coordinate defined by $\\mathbf{e}_1$. This is a necessary condition for a TS.\n\n3.  The definitive characteristic of a TS connecting reactant $\\mathbf{Q}_{\\mathrm{R}}$ and product $\\mathbf{Q}_{\\mathrm{P}}$ is that it lies on the reaction path between them. Principle (v) defines the Intrinsic Reaction Coordinate (IRC) as the steepest-descent path in mass-weighted coordinates. A true TS must be the source of two such paths: one leading \"downhill\" to the reactant basin of attraction and the other leading \"downhill\" to the product basin. The IRC calculation is the computational realization of finding these paths.\n\n4.  To initiate an IRC calculation from a TS, one displaces the geometry infinitesimally from $\\mathbf{Q}_0$ along the transition vector, $\\pm\\mathbf{e}_1$. The gradient at this displaced point, let's say $\\mathbf{Q}_+ = \\mathbf{Q}_0 + \\epsilon\\mathbf{e}_1$ for a very small $\\epsilon  0$, can be approximated using a first-order Taylor expansion of the gradient: $\\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{Q}_+) \\approx \\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{Q}_0) + \\mathbf{H}(\\mathbf{Q}_0)(\\mathbf{Q}_+ - \\mathbf{Q}_0) = \\mathbf{0} + \\mathbf{H}(\\epsilon\\mathbf{e}_1) = \\epsilon\\lambda_1\\mathbf{e}_1$. The direction of steepest descent is $-\\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{Q}_+)$, which is proportional to $-\\lambda_1\\mathbf{e}_1$. Since $\\lambda_1  0$, this direction is parallel to $+\\mathbf{e}_1$. This confirms that the initial tangent of the IRC path must be parallel to the transition vector $\\mathbf{e}_1$.\n\nA rigorous protocol must therefore verify not only the local negative curvature but, most critically, the global connectivity through an IRC calculation. Additionally, a sound heuristic is that the motion described by the transition vector $\\mathbf{e}_1$ should be chemically relevant to the transformation from $\\mathbf{Q}_{\\mathrm{R}}$ to $\\mathbf{Q}_{\\mathrm{P}}$.\n\nNow, I shall evaluate each option based on this derivation.\n\n**A. Work in mass-weighted Cartesian coordinates...**\nThis option presents a multi-step protocol.\n- **Local Analysis:** It correctly proposes displacing along $\\pm\\mathbf{e}_1$ and checking the energies and gradients. The check of harmonic antisymmetry, $g_\\parallel(\\delta)\\approx -g_\\parallel(-\\delta)$, and curvature, $\\Delta V(\\delta)+\\Delta V(-\\delta)\\approx \\lambda_1 \\delta^20$, is a robust way to verify that the single-point calculations are consistent with the properties of the Hessian. This confirms the local topography is indeed that of a saddle point.\n- **Numerical Stability:** The step-reversal check is a good practice for validating the numerical integrator for the path-following algorithm, adding to the overall rigor, although it is not strictly a test of the PES itself.\n- **Global Connectivity:** The proposal to integrate IRC segments from $\\mathbf{Q}_0$ and confirm they connect to two *distinct* minima is the crucial, definitive test for a TS. It directly tests the function of the stationary point. Verifying that the initial tangent is parallel to $\\mathbf{e}_1$ confirms the calculation is initiated correctly.\n- **Chemical Heuristic:** The cross-check of projecting $\\mathbf{e}_1$ onto the reactant-product-vector $\\hat{\\Delta\\mathbf{Q}}$ provides strong supporting evidence that the identified path is the chemically relevant one. Ensuring no contamination from translational/rotational modes is also critical.\n- **Conclusion:** The protocol is comprehensive, layered with checks from local consistency to global connectivity and chemical intuition. It is fully grounded in the provided principles.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Reoptimize $\\mathbf{Q}_0$ with tighter...thresholds...**\nThis protocol suggests that increasing numerical precision is sufficient. While this is a reasonable first step (the imaginary mode might indeed vanish), it is not a sufficient diagnostic protocol. A true, very flat transition state might still possess a small imaginary frequency even at higher precision. Crucially, this option fails to test the defining property of a transition state: its connection between two minima. It relies solely on the Hessian index, which is the very source of the initial ambiguity. Using a \"non-mass-weighted\" Hessian is also formally incorrect for vibrational analysis.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Compute a one-sided energy scan by displacing the structure by $\\delta$ along an arbitrary internal coordinate...**\nThis proposal is fundamentally flawed. A saddle point has negative curvature along only one specific direction (or a few, for higher-order saddles), which is given by the eigenvector $\\mathbf{e}_1$. Displacing along an *arbitrary* coordinate will most likely lead to an increase in energy, providing no useful information and potentially leading to the wrong conclusion. Even if the displacement happened to find a direction of energy lowering, this only proves the point is not a minimum; it does not prove it is the specific first-order saddle point connecting $\\mathbf{Q}_{\\mathrm{R}}$ and $\\mathbf{Q}_{\\mathrm{P}}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Launch two unconstrained geometry optimizations from $\\mathbf{Q}_\\pm=\\mathbf{Q}_0\\pm \\delta\\,\\mathbf{e}_1$...**\nThis method, sometimes called a \"nudge\", is a plausible but inferior alternative to an IRC. An unconstrained optimization algorithm is not guaranteed to follow the steepest-descent path (the IRC). More importantly, the criterion given is weak: \"...if both converge to any minima (possibly the same)...\". A true TS for the reaction $\\mathbf{Q}_{\\mathrm{R}} \\to \\mathbf{Q}_{\\mathrm{P}}$ must connect to these two *distinct* minima. If the optimizations lead to the same minimum, for example, it could indicate a TS for a conformational rotation, not the reaction of interest. The protocol lacks the rigor and specificity of an IRC calculation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Transform the Hessian to redundant internal coordinates... require exactly one negative eigenvalue... if $|\\tilde{\\nu}_1|20\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, consider it numerical...**\nThis option is flawed on multiple grounds. First, simply re-evaluating the Hessian index in a different coordinate system does not resolve the ambiguity of whether a small negative eigenvalue is physical or an artifact. Second, and more critically, it proposes resolving the issue by applying an arbitrary numerical threshold ($20\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$). Science does not operate on arbitrary rules of thumb when a rigorous physical test is available. Some physically real transition states have very low frequencies, and some numerical errors can be larger than this threshold. Explicitly stating that \"No IRC or projection checks are necessary\" rejects the most definitive physical test. This method replaces rigorous analysis with arbitrary classification.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nIn summary, only option A proposes a protocol that is sufficiently rigorous, comprehensive, and grounded in the fundamental physical definition of a transition state.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2878638"}]}
