Therefore, the problem is valid, and we proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe central task is to derive the ratio of the single-molecule canonical partition function of the transition state, $Q^\\ddagger$, to that of the reactant, $Q_R$. The problem specifies that we assume separability of the energy modes, which allows the total partition function for a species to be written as a product of its translational, rotational, vibrational, and electronic contributions.

It is a nonlinear molecule composed of $N$ atoms. It possesses $3$ translational degrees of freedom, $3$ rotational degrees of freedom, and $3N-6$ vibrational degrees of freedom.\n\nThe component partition functions for the reactant $R$ are as follows:\n$1$.
