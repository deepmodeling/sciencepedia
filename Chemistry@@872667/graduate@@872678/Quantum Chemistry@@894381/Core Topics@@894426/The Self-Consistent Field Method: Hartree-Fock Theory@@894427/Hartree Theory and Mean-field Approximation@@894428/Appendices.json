We work in Hartree atomic units.\n\nThe Hartree potential $v_{\\rm H}(\\mathbf{r})$ is defined as the electrostatic potential generated by the electron number density $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$. Its defining integral form is $v_{\\rm H}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\mathbf{r}')}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'|} d\\mathbf{r}'$. This potential satisfies the Poisson equation:\n$$ \\nabla^2 v_{\\rm H}(\\mathbf{r}) = -4\\pi \\rho(\\mathbf{r}) $$\n\nTo analyze this equation under PBC in a cubic cell of volume $\\Omega$, we utilize a Fourier series representation for periodic functions. Any such function $f(\\mathbf{r})$ can be expanded as $f(\\mathbf{r}) = \\sum_{\\mathbf{k}} \\tilde{f}(\\mathbf{k}) e^{i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r}}$, where the sum is over the reciprocal lattice vectors $\\mathbf{k}$ compatible with the PBC.

Therefore, the solvability condition for the Poisson equation under PBC is that the average value of the source density must be zero.\n\nNext, we explain why a UEG with density $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})=\\rho  0$ cannot produce a well-defined $v_{\\rm H}(\\mathbf{r})$ in the absence of a background. For a uniform density $\\rho$, its average value is $\\langle \\rho \\rangle = \\rho$. Since $\\rho0$, the solvability condition $\\langle \\rho \\rangle = 0$ is violated.

The value of this constant is its spatial average, $\\tilde{v}_{\\rm H}(\\mathbf{0}) = \\langle v_{\\rm H} \\rangle$.\n\nThe problem states the convention to be used to fix this constant: the cell average of the potential is zero.\n$$ \\frac{1}{\\Omega}\\int_{\\Omega} v_{\\rm H}(\\mathbf{r})\\,d\\mathbf{r} = 0 $$\nSince $v_{\\rm H}(\\mathbf{r})$ is a constant, its average is simply its value.

The nonlinearity arises from the mean-field potential term, which depends on the orbitals that are themselves the solutions to the equations. It is this self-consistency requirement that gives the method its character.\n\nA. Because the Hartree Euler–Lagrange equations are nonlinear in the orbitals through the mean field generated by the density, multiple distinct self-consistent solutions can exist for the same $v_{\\mathrm{ext}}(x)$ and $N$, including solutions that break the spatial symmetry of $v_{\\mathrm{ext}}(x)$.\n\nThis statement is correct. The presence of nonlinearity is a general and fundamental reason for the possible existence of multiple solutions to a set of equations. In the context of Hartree theory, a solution is a set of orbitals $\\{\\phi_i\\}$ that generates a mean-field potential which, in turn, yields the same set of orbitals as its eigenfunctions. It is entirely possible for several different sets of orbitals to be self-consistent in this manner. Furthermore, for a system with a symmetric external potential $v_{\\mathrm{ext}}(x) = v_{\\mathrm{ext}}(-x)$, the equations do not preclude solutions that lack this symmetry. Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a well-known phenomenon in nonlinear systems and mean-field theories. While a symmetric solution may exist, other, asymmetric solutions can also arise, particularly when the inter-particle repulsion is strong enough to favor spatial localization of electrons, which breaks the symmetry of the delocalized, non-interacting ground state. For the given double-well potential, this could manifest as solutions where the total electron density $\\rho(x) = \\sum_i |\\phi_i(x)|^2$ is not symmetric, i.e., $\\rho(x) \\neq \\rho(-x)$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nB. If two distinct Hartree solutions are found, the one with the smaller lowest single-particle eigenvalue of its associated mean-field operator necessarily has the lower total Hartree energy.\n\nThis statement is incorrect. The total Hartree energy $E$ is related to the sum of the orbital eigenvalues $\\epsilon_i$ by the expression:\n$$ E = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\epsilon_i - E_{\\mathrm{int}} = \\sum_{i=1}^N \\epsilon_i - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i \\neq j}^N \\iint |\\phi_i(\\mathbf{r})|^2 w(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}') |\\phi_j(\\mathbf{r}')|^2 d\\mathbf{r}d\\mathbf{r}' $$\nThe term $E_{\\mathrm{int}}$ subtracts the interaction energy, which is double-counted in the sum of eigenvalues. Let us consider two distinct self-consistent solutions, labeled $1$ and $2$. Let the set of eigenvalues for solution $1$ be $\\{\\epsilon_i^{(1)}\\}$ and for solution $2$ be $\\{\\epsilon_i^{(2)}\\}$. The statement posits that if $\\min_i\\{\\epsilon_i^{(1)}\\}  \\min_i\\{\\epsilon_i^{(2)}\\}$, it follows that $E^{(1)}  E^{(2)}$. There is no theorem that guarantees this. The total energy depends on the sum of all eigenvalues and the interaction energy term. A solution could have a very low-lying single-particle state but high-lying other states, leading to a large $\\sum_i \\epsilon_i$. Moreover, the interaction correction term $E_{\\mathrm{int}}$ can be substantially different between the two solutions. Therefore, one cannot compare the total energies of two different self-consistent solutions by merely inspecting their lowest single-particle eigenvalues.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nC. The variational principle restricted to Hartree product states implies that all self-consistent Hartree solutions are stationary points of $E[\\{\\phi_i\\}]$, and the physically relevant mean-field ground state is the one with the globally minimal total Hartree energy among those stationary points.\n\nThis statement is correct. The derivation of the Hartree equations via the Lagrange multiplier method is precisely the procedure for finding stationary points (extrema or saddle points) of the energy functional $E[\\{\\phi_i\\}]$ subject to constraints. Thus, any self-consistent solution, by definition, corresponds to a stationary point of the Hartree energy. The variational principle dictates that the expectation value of the Hamiltonian for any trial state is an upper bound to the true ground-state energy. When the variational search is restricted to a subset of all possible states (here, Hartree product states), the best approximation to the ground state energy within that subset is the global minimum of the energy functional over that subset. The corresponding state is the \"mean-field ground state\". Other stationary points, such as local minima or saddle points, represent metastable or unstable self-consistent solutions within the Hartree approximation.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nD. A practical and theoretically sound stability criterion is to examine the second variation (Hessian) $\\delta^2 E$ with respect to orbital variations consistent with the normalization constraints: a global minimum must have a positive semidefinite Hessian, whereas the presence of at least one direction with negative curvature indicates a saddle point (instability).\n\nThis statement is correct. It is a direct application of variational calculus to analyze the nature of the stationary points found by solving the Hartree equations. A stationary point of a functional is a local minimum only if the second functional derivative (the Hessian) is positive semidefinite for all allowed variations. If the Hessian has one or more negative eigenvalues, it means there exist directions of variation that lower the energy. A stationary point with this property is a saddle point (or local maximum) and is considered unstable, as small perturbations will cause the system to evolve toward a lower-energy configuration. A true ground state, being a global minimum, must also be a local minimum and hence must have a positive semidefinite Hessian. This stability analysis is a standard procedure in quantum chemistry to test whether a converged Self-Consistent Field (SCF) solution corresponds to a genuine minimum or an unstable saddle point.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\nE. By the Hohenberg–Kohn (HK) theorem of density functional theory, there cannot be more than one self-consistent Hartree solution for a given $v_{\\mathrm{ext}}(x)$ and $N$, since the ground-state density is unique; therefore, multiple SCF solutions are excluded.\n\nThis statement is incorrect and demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding. The Hohenberg-Kohn theorems apply to the *exact* many-body system. They establish a formal, one-to-one correspondence between the external potential $v_{\\mathrm{ext}}(\\mathbf{r})$ and the *exact* ground-state electron density $\\rho_0(\\mathbf{r})$. The Hartree theory, however, is an *approximate* method. The Hartree energy functional is not the exact universal functional of the density, and the Hartree wavefunction is not the true ground-state wavefunction. The HK theorems do not apply to the solutions of approximate, model-based equations like the Hartree equations. The existence of multiple solutions is a mathematical feature of the nonlinear self-consistent equations of the Hartree approximation itself. These multiple solutions are stationary points of the *approximate* Hartree energy functional, and they do not violate any principle of exact quantum mechanics. The colleague's assertion mentioned in the problem description is based on this same flawed logic.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nF. In a symmetric double-well with repulsive interaction as above, there may be a parameter regime (e.g., sufficiently large $g$ relative to tunneling set by $V_0$ and $a$) where a symmetry-preserving delocalized Hartree solution coexists with symmetry-broken solutions localized predominantly in either well; beyond a critical interaction strength, the symmetry-broken solutions can have lower Hartree energy than the symmetric one.\n\nThis statement provides a correct physical description of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the given model system. In the absence of electron-electron interaction ($g=0$), the ground state would be symmetric and delocalized across both wells to minimize kinetic energy. For weak repulsion ($g$ is small), this symmetric solution remains the lowest in energy. However, as the repulsion strength $g$ increases, the cost of having electrons occupy the same spatial region rises. At some point, it may become energetically favorable for the electrons to localize in separate wells to reduce their repulsion energy, even at the cost of increased kinetic and potential energy. This leads to the emergence of symmetry-broken solutions. A typical scenario is that beyond a critical value of $g$, a bifurcation occurs where new, symmetry-broken solutions appear and their energy drops below that of the original symmetric solution. The symmetric solution may remain as a local minimum (a metastable state) or become unstable (a saddle point). The statement accurately captures this physical competition between delocalization (favored by single-particle terms) and localization (favored by repulsion), and correctly identifies the crossover phenomenon.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACDF}$$", "id": "2895435"}]}
