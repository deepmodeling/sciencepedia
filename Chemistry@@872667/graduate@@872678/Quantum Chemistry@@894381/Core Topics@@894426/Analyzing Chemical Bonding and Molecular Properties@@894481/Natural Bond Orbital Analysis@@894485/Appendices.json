In Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis, a hyperconjugative stabilization arises from donor–acceptor mixing between an occupied donor natural bond orbital and a formally unoccupied acceptor natural bond orbital. In a deletion analysis (the NBO `DELETE` keyword), a specified set of donor–acceptor couplings is removed, and the energetic penalty of this removal is equal to the stabilization that those couplings had provided. Starting from the Hartree–Fock picture and standard time-independent, non-degenerate second-order perturbation theory, derive the leading-order expression for the stabilization energy due to the interaction between one occupied donor and one empty acceptor in terms of the donor occupancy, the off-diagonal Fock matrix element, and the orbital energy gap.

We work within the Hartree-Fock approximation, where the effective one-electron Hamiltonian is the Fock operator, $\\hat{F}$.\n\nIn the NBO basis, which is assumed to be orthonormal, the Fock matrix is not diagonal. The diagonal elements, $F_{kk} = \\langle \\phi_k | \\hat{F} | \\phi_k \\rangle$, are the NBO orbital energies, which we denote as $\\epsilon_k$. The off-diagonal elements, $F_{ij} = \\langle \\phi_i | \\hat{F} | \\phi_j \\rangle$ for $i \\neq j$, represent the coupling or interaction between different NBOs. These off-diagonal elements are precisely what give rise to delocalization effects such as hyperconjugation.\n\nTo quantify the energetic effect of these interactions, we employ time-independent, non-degenerate perturbation theory. We partition the Fock operator $\\hat{F}$ into two parts: an unperturbed Hamiltonian $\\hat{H}^{(0)}$ and a perturbation $\\hat{V}$.\n\nThe unperturbed system, $\\hat{H}^{(0)}$, is defined as the diagonal part of the Fock operator in the NBO basis. Its eigenfunctions are the NBOs themselves, $|\\phi_k\\rangle$, with corresponding eigenvalues being the NBO energies, $\\epsilon_k$:\n$$\n\\hat{H}^{(0)} |\\phi_k\\rangle = \\epsilon_k |\\phi_k\\rangle\n$$\nThe perturbation, $\\hat{V}$, comprises all off-diagonal elements of the Fock operator. We are concerned with the specific interaction between donor $|\\phi_i\\rangle$ and acceptor $|\\phi_j\\rangle$, so the perturbation of interest involves the matrix element $F_{ij}$.\n\nAccording to standard second-order perturbation theory, the energy of the state $|\\phi_i\\rangle$ is lowered due to its interaction with another state $|\\phi_j\\rangle$. The second-order correction to the energy, $E_i^{(2)}$, is given by:\n$$\nE_i^{(2)} = \\sum_{j \\neq i} \\frac{|\\langle \\phi_i | \\hat{V} | \\phi_j \\rangle|^2}{\\epsilon_i - \\epsilon_j}\n$$\nIn our specific donor-acceptor case, the perturbation matrix element $\\langle \\phi_i | \\hat{V} | \\phi_j \\rangle$ is simply the off-diagonal Fock matrix element $F_{ij}$. The energy correction for the interaction between a single donor $|\\phi_i\\rangle$ and a single acceptor $|\\phi_j\\rangle$ is thus:\n$$\n\\Delta E_i^{(2)} = \\frac{|F_{ij}|^2}{\\epsilon_i - \\epsilon_j}\n$$\nThis expression represents the energy change for a single electron. The donor NBO $|\\phi_i\\rangle$ is occupied by $n_i$ electrons. Therefore, the total stabilization energy resulting from the delocalization of these $n_i$ electrons into the acceptor orbital $|\\phi_j\\rangle$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{i \\rightarrow j} = n_i \\times \\Delta E_i^{(2)} = n_i \\frac{|F_{ij}|^2}{\\epsilon_i - \\epsilon_j}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that the donor energy $\\epsilon_i$ is lower than the acceptor energy $\\epsilon_j$, so the denominator $\\epsilon_i - \\epsilon_j$ is negative. This makes $\\Delta E_{i \\rightarrow j}$ a negative quantity, correctly representing a stabilization of the system's total energy.\n\nThe NBO deletion analysis computes the energetic *penalty* associated with removing this interaction. This penalty is defined as the positive magnitude of the stabilization energy. Let us denote this quantity by $E^{(2)}_{i \\rightarrow j}$:\n$$\nE^{(2)}_{i \\rightarrow j} = |\\Delta E_{i \\rightarrow j}| = \\left| n_i \\frac{|F_{ij}|^2}{\\epsilon_i - \\epsilon_j} \\right| = n_i \\frac{|F_{ij}|^2}{\\epsilon_j - \\epsilon_i}\n$$\nSince $F_{ij}$ is given as a real number, $|F_{ij}|^2$ simplifies to $F_{ij}^2$. The final expression for the destabilization energy upon deleting a single donor-acceptor interaction is:\n$$\nE^{(2)}_{i \\rightarrow j} = n_i \\frac{F_{ij}^2}{\\epsilon_j - \\epsilon_i}\n$$\nThis is the fundamental expression used in NBO analysis to estimate the strength of hyperconjugative and other delocalization effects. The problem requires this to be generalized for the case of multiple donors, indexed by $k$, interacting with a single acceptor $j$. Assuming the contributions are additive, which is valid under the small-perturbation approximation, the total destabilization energy, $E_{\\text{total}}$, is the sum of the individual contributions:\n$$\nE_{\\text{total}} = \\sum_{k} E^{(2)}_{i_k \\rightarrow j} = \\sum_{k} n_{i_k} \\frac{F_{i_k j}^2}{\\epsilon_j - \\epsilon_{i_k}}\n$$\nThis is the final expression to be implemented.

Consider how a standard Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) analysis, as implemented in typical electronic structure codes, constructs the bonding description of such a hypercoordinate main-group species. NBO theory defines a natural Lewis structure as the bonding pattern that maximizes occupancy of localized $2c$–$2e$ bond orbitals and lone pairs, and interprets departures from this ideal via donor–acceptor delocalization between filled and empty (or antibonding) NBOs. For third-row elements, NBO also assesses the actual occupancy and energetic role of central-atom $d$-functions.\n\nWhich of the following statements best reflects the NBO description of bonding in $\\mathrm{PCl_5}$?\n\nA.

NBO assigns five $2c$–$2e$ P-Cl bonds using only P $3s$ and P $3p$ hybrids (no P $3d$), finds axial and equatorial bonds exactly equivalent, and detects no significant charge separation or donor–acceptor delocalization.", "solution": "### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe core of the Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) method is to find the most faithful representation of the molecular wavefunction in terms of a classic Lewis structure, which consists of localized $1$-center lone pairs ($n$) and $2$-center bonds ($\\sigma$ or $\\pi$). The \"best\" Lewis structure is defined as the one that maximizes the total electron occupancy in these localized NBOs. For main-group elements, NBO analysis strongly adheres to the octet rule.\n\nFor phosphorus pentachloride, $\\mathrm{PCl_5}$, a Lewis structure with five $2c$–$2e$ covalent bonds to the central phosphorus atom would assign $10$ valence electrons to it, a formal violation of the octet rule. The NBO algorithm will therefore reject such a \"hypervalent\" structure as the primary natural Lewis structure. Instead, it will search for a resonance structure that satisfies the octet rule for all atoms.\n\nFor $\\mathrm{PCl_5}$, this is achieved by postulating an ionic structure. The NBO procedure will find that the Lewis structure with the highest occupancy is one where the phosphorus atom forms four covalent bonds and one of the chlorines exists as an anion, $\\mathrm{Cl^-}$. This leads to a charge-separated resonance form of the type $\\mathrm{PCl_4^+} \\mathrm{Cl^-}$. In this picture, the phosphorus atom in the $\\mathrm{PCl_4^+}$ cation formally bears a $+1$ charge and satisfies the octet rule with four bonds.\n\nThe observed trigonal bipyramidal geometry with five $\\mathrm{P{-}Cl}$ contacts is then recovered by considering strong electronic delocalization, which NBO treats as a perturbation on the idealized Lewis structure. These are donor-acceptor interactions. The most significant delocalization involves the formally non-bonded axial chloride anion. A lone pair NBO on this axial chloride, $n(\\mathrm{Cl_{ax}})$, acts as a strong donor into the empty antibonding NBO of the phosphorus-chlorine bond on the opposite side of the molecule, $\\sigma^\\ast(\\mathrm{P{-}Cl_{ax}})$. This powerful $n \\to \\sigma^\\ast$ interaction is energetically very significant (often calculated to be $> 50 \\ \\mathrm{kcal/mol}$). This delocalization effectively creates what is known in qualitative molecular orbital theory as a $3$-center–$4$-electron ($3c$–$4e$) bond along the axial $\\mathrm{Cl{-}P{-}Cl}$ axis.\n\nThis model has several key consequences that are hallmarks of the NBO interpretation:\n1.  **Role of $d$-orbitals**: The NBO analysis of $\\mathrm{PCl_5}$ consistently finds that the total occupancy of the phosphorus $3d$ orbitals is extremely small (typically on the order of $0.01$–$0.05$ electrons). NBO theory thus concludes that $d$-orbitals play no significant role in the bonding of main-group hypercoordinate molecules. The older $sp^3d$ hybridization model is explicitly refuted.\n2.  **Bond differentiation**: The equatorial $\\mathrm{P{-}Cl}$ bonds are described as fairly conventional, albeit highly polarized, $2c$–$2e$ covalent $\\sigma$ bonds. The axial $\\mathrm{P{-}Cl}$ bonds, however, are a result of the $3c$–$4e$ interaction. This fundamental difference in bonding character explains why axial bonds are experimentally observed to be longer and weaker than equatorial bonds.\n3.  **Charge Distribution**: The underlying ionic Lewis structure and the high electronegativity of chlorine result in a significant calculated charge separation. The natural atomic charge on phosphorus is strongly positive, and the charges on the chlorines are negative.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option based on this framework.\n\n**A. NBO favors a hypervalent Lewis structure with five equivalent $2c$–$2e$ $\\mathrm{P{-}Cl}$ bonds formed by strong $\\mathrm{P}\\,3d$ participation (i.e., $sp^3d$ hybridization), with natural charges near zero and negligible donor–acceptor delocalization.**\nThis statement describes the outdated valence bond model invoking $sp^3d$ hybridization. It is diametrically opposed to the NBO interpretation. NBO rejects the hypervalent Lewis structure, finds negligible $\\mathrm{P}\\,3d$ participation, predicts significant charge separation, and relies on strong donor–acceptor delocalization to explain the bonding.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. NBO favors a charge-separated Lewis structure dominated by the $\\mathrm{PCl_4^+\\,Cl^-}$ resonance form that preserves an octet at phosphorus in the Lewis picture; hypervalency is expressed primarily through donor–acceptor interactions $n(\\mathrm{Cl_{ax}})\\to \\sigma^\\ast(\\mathrm{P{-}Cl})$ that impart $3c$–$4e$ character to the axial region, with negligible $\\mathrm{P}\\,3d$ occupancy; axial $\\mathrm{P{-}Cl}$ bonds are longer and weaker than equatorial.**\nThis statement accurately summarizes the entire NBO model for $\\mathrm{PCl_5}$. It correctly identifies: (1) the preference for an octet-satisfying ionic Lewis structure ($\\mathrm{PCl_4^+\\,Cl^-}$), (2) the mechanism of hypervalency via $n \\to \\sigma^\\ast$ donor-acceptor interactions, (3) the resulting $3c$–$4e$ character of the axial system, (4) the conclusion of negligible $\\mathrm{P}\\,3d$ occupancy, and (5) the structural consequence that axial bonds are distinct from (longer and weaker than) equatorial bonds.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. NBO identifies no recognizable $2c$–$2e$ bonds in $\\mathrm{PCl_5}$, instead assigning a metallic-like, six-center electron cloud delocalized over all atoms, with no significant polarization or charge separation.**\nThis is a description more akin to a fully delocalized molecular orbital picture for a metallic system. The NBO method is fundamentally based on finding a localized Lewis structure, and it successfully identifies three strong $2c$–$2e$ bonds in the equatorial plane. It also predicts very significant charge separation, not its absence.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D.

One cannot form five orthogonal localized bonds from only four atomic orbitals ($s+p_x+p_y+p_z$). Furthermore, NBO does not find five $2c$–$2e$ bonds as its primary structure, it does not find the bonds to be equivalent, and it finds both charge separation and donor-acceptor interactions to be critically important.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2459207"}]}
