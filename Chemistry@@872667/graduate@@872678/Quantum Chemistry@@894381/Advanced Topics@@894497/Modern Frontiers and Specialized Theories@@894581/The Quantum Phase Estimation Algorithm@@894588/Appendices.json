The following exercise guides you through the process of navigating this trade-off to find an optimal range for $t$, a core skill for any practitioner aiming to use QPE for high-precision spectroscopy [@problem_id:2931356].", "problem": "In a chemically realistic active-space model, let the molecular electronic Hamiltonian $H$ be represented in atomic units so that the reduced Planck constant $\\hbar$ equals $1$. You implement the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm on the unitary time-evolution operator $U(t) = \\exp\\!\\left(-i\\,(H - E_{\\mathrm{ref}})\\, t\\right)$, where $E_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ is an energy shift chosen to center the spectrum of interest and $t$ is the evolution time. Two eigenstates $\\lvert \\psi_{1} \\rangle$ and $\\lvert \\psi_{2} \\rangle$ are known to be near-degenerate, with corresponding eigenvalues $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ satisfying an energy separation $\\Delta E = |E_{2} - E_{1}|$.

No phase aliasing (wrapping ambiguity) occurs for any energy within the spectral window.\n- The final answer for $t$ must be in atomic time units and rounded to four significant figures.\n\nStep 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is subjected to validation.\n- **Scientifically Grounded:** The problem is firmly rooted in the principles of quantum mechanics and quantum computation. The formulation of the QPE algorithm, the definition of the unitary operator, eigenphases, and the concepts of phase resolution and aliasing are all standard and correct. The use of atomic units ($\\hbar = 1$) is standard practice in quantum chemistry. The provided numerical values are physically plausible for a molecular system. The problem is scientifically valid.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides a complete set of numerical values and two clear, distinct conditions that constrain the evolution time $t$. It asks for a minimal value, which is a well-defined mathematical objective. The constraints lead to a bounded interval for the solution. The problem is well-posed.\n- **Objective:** The language is technical, precise, and free of any subjective or ambiguous terminology. All terms are standard in the field of quantum information science. The problem is objective.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A rigorous solution will now be derived.\n\nThe problem requires finding the minimal evolution time $t$ that satisfies two independent conditions. Both conditions will be translated into mathematical inequalities involving $t$.\n\nCondition 1: Distinguishability of near-degenerate phases.\nThe true phases associated with the energies $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ are $\\theta_{1} = (E_{1} - E_{\\mathrm{ref}})t$ and $\\theta_{2} = (E_{2} - E_{\\mathrm{ref}})t$, ignoring the modulo $2\\pi$ for the derivation of the separation. The absolute difference between these true phases is:\n$$ |\\theta_{2} - \\theta_{1}| = |(E_{2} - E_{\\mathrm{ref}})t - (E_{1} - E_{\\mathrm{ref}})t| = |E_{2} - E_{1}|t = \\Delta E \\cdot t $$\nThe QPE algorithm provides estimates $\\hat{\\theta}_{1}$ and $\\hat{\\theta}_{2}$ with a guaranteed precision $\\varepsilon$. This means the estimated values lie in the intervals $[\\theta_{1} - \\varepsilon, \\theta_{1} + \\varepsilon]$ and $[\\theta_{2} - \\varepsilon, \\theta_{2} + \\varepsilon]$, respectively. For the two eigenstates to be distinguishable with certainty based on their phase estimates, these two uncertainty intervals must be disjoint. The worst-case scenario for distinguishability occurs when the estimation errors conspire to bring the measured values as close as possible. For instance, if $\\hat{\\theta}_{1}$ is at the upper bound of its interval ($\\theta_{1} + \\varepsilon$) and $\\hat{\\theta}_{2}$ is at the lower bound of its interval ($\\theta_{2} - \\varepsilon$). To prevent these worst-case estimates from overlapping or being equal, the distance between the centers of the intervals, $|\\theta_{2} - \\theta_{1}|$, must be strictly greater than the sum of the radii of the intervals, which is $\\varepsilon + \\varepsilon = 2\\varepsilon$.\n$$ |\\theta_{2} - \\theta_{1}| > 2\\varepsilon $$\nSubstituting the expression for the phase difference, we obtain the first constraint on $t$:\n$$ \\Delta E \\cdot t > 2\\varepsilon $$\n$$ t > \\frac{2\\varepsilon}{\\Delta E} $$\nThis inequality establishes a lower bound on the evolution time $t$.\n\nCondition 2: Avoidance of phase aliasing.\nPhase aliasing occurs when the mapping from energy to phase is not unique due to the $2\\pi$-periodicity of the phase. This happens if the range of phases for the entire spectral window of interest becomes too large.\nWe are given that all relevant energy eigenvalues $E_{k}$ satisfy $|E_{k} - E_{\\mathrm{ref}}| \\le W$. Let $\\delta E_{k} = E_{k} - E_{\\mathrm{ref}}$, so $|\\delta E_{k}| \\le W$. The unwrapped phase is $\\delta E_{k} \\cdot t$. The full range of these unwrapped phases spans from $-W t$ to $+W t$. The total width of this phase range is therefore $(W t) - (-W t) = 2 W t$.\nTo ensure that no two distinct energies within the window can be mapped to the same phase after the modulo $2\\pi$ operation, this total phase span must be strictly less than one full circle, i.e., $2\\pi$ radians. If the span were equal to $2\\pi$, the two extremal energies corresponding to $\\delta E = -W$ and $\\delta E = +W$ would have phases $-Wt = -\\pi$ and $+Wt = +\\pi$, which are identical modulo $2\\pi$.\nThus, the no-aliasing condition requires:\n$$ 2 W t < 2\\pi $$\n$$ t < \\frac{\\pi}{W} $$\nThis inequality establishes an upper bound on the evolution time $t$.\n\nCombining the two conditions, a valid evolution time $t$ must lie within the open interval:\n$$ \\frac{2\\varepsilon}{\\Delta E} < t < \\frac{\\pi}{W} $$\nFor a solution to exist, the lower bound must be less than the upper bound. We verify this with the given numerical values:\nLower bound: $t > \\frac{2(0.02)}{1.5 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{0.04}{0.0015} = \\frac{400}{15} = \\frac{80}{3} \\approx 26.66...$ atomic time units.\nUpper bound: $t < \\frac{\\pi}{0.05} = 20\\pi \\approx 62.83...$ atomic time units.\nSince $26.66... < 62.83...$, a valid time interval exists.\n\nThe problem asks for the minimal evolution time $t$ that *guarantees* the conditions are met. This refers to the infimum, or the greatest lower bound, of the set of allowed times. Any evolution time must be strictly greater than this value. This minimal required time is therefore the threshold set by the distinguishability condition.\n$$ t_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{2\\varepsilon}{\\Delta E} $$\nSubstituting the numerical values:\n$$ t_{\\text{min}} = \\frac{2 \\times 0.02}{1.5 \\times 10^{-3}} = \\frac{80}{3} \\approx 26.6666... $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$ t_{\\text{min}} \\approx 26.67 $$\nThis value represents the minimum time requirement.

The problem is free of contradictions, ambiguities, and factual errors.\n\nThe core task is to determine the resource requirements for the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm to estimate a Hamiltonian eigenvalue $E$ to a specified precision $\\varepsilon$.\n\nFirst, we relate the energy eigenvalue $E$ of the Hamiltonian $H$ to the phase of the eigenvalue of the unitary operator $U = \\exp(-i H t)$. Let $\\lvert E \\rangle$ be an eigenstate of $H$ with eigenvalue $E$. Then, applying $U$ to $\\lvert E \\rangle$ gives:\n$$U \\lvert E \\rangle = \\exp(-i H t) \\lvert E \\rangle = \\exp(-i E t) \\lvert E \\rangle$$\nThe QPE algorithm is designed to estimate the phase $\\phi$ in the eigenvalue equation $U \\lvert \\psi \\rangle = \\exp(i \\phi) \\lvert \\psi \\rangle$. By comparison, the phase for the eigenstate $\\lvert E \\rangle$ is $\\phi = -E t$.\n\nThe problem states that the spectrum of $H$ lies in the interval $[0, W]$, where $W = 10$ Hartree.

This interval has a length of $\\pi$, which is less than $2\\pi$, so there is no ambiguity in the phase (no \"phase wrapping\").\n\nThe QPE algorithm uses an $n$-qubit register to estimate the phase. The algorithm outputs a classical integer $j \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots, 2^n - 1\\}$, which provides an estimate of the phase $\\phi$ via the relation $\\tilde{\\phi} = 2\\pi (j/2^n)$.
