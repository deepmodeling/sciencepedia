It presents a standard exercise in conceptual Density Functional Theory (DFT), free of factual errors, contradictions, or ambiguities. We shall therefore proceed with its solution.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. First, we must derive an expression for the global chemical hardness, $\\eta$, in terms of the vertical ionization potential, $I$, and the vertical electron affinity, $A$. Second, we must compute a numerical value for $\\eta$ using provided data.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the expression for $\\eta$.\n\nThe global chemical hardness is defined as:\n$$ \\eta = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2} E}{\\partial N^{2}}\\right)_{v} $$\nwhere $E(N)$ is the ground-state electronic energy as a function of the number of electrons, $N$, at a fixed external potential, $v(\\mathbf{r})$.\n\nThe problem requires the use of a symmetric three-point finite-difference approximation to evaluate the second partial derivative, $\\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2} E}{\\partial N^{2}}\\right)_{v}$, at an integer number of electrons, $N$. The general formula for a symmetric three-point finite-difference approximation of the second derivative of a function $f(x)$ at a point $x$ is:\n$$ f''(x) \\approx \\frac{f(x+h) - 2f(x) + f(x-h)}{h^2} $$\nIn our specific case, the function is $E(N)$, the point of evaluation is an integer $N$, and the step size, $h$, corresponds to the addition or removal of a single electron, thus $h=1$. Applying this approximation to the energy function $E(N)$ gives:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2} E}{\\partial N^{2}}\\right)_{v} \\approx \\frac{E(N+1) - 2E(N) + E(N-1)}{1^2} = E(N-1) - 2E(N) + E(N+1) $$\nSubstituting this result into the definition of hardness, $\\eta$, we obtain:\n$$ \\eta \\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ E(N-1) - 2E(N) + E(N+1) \\right] $$\nTo express this in terms of the ionization potential, $I$, and electron affinity, $A$, we recall their definitions:\n$$ I = E(N-1) - E(N) $$\n$$ A = E(N) - E(N+1) $$\nThese definitions are for vertical processes, meaning all energies are evaluated at the same fixed nuclear geometry, which is consistent with the fixed external potential condition, $(\\dots)_{v}$.\n\nWe can rearrange the expression for $\\eta$ by regrouping the energy terms:\n$$ \\eta \\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (E(N-1) - E(N)) + (E(N+1) - E(N)) \\right] $$\nThe first term, $(E(N-1) - E(N))$, is precisely the definition of the ionization potential, $I$. The second term, $(E(N+1) - E(N))$, is the negative of the electron affinity, $A$, since $A = E(N) - E(N+1)$, which implies $-(E(N) - E(N+1)) = E(N+1) - E(N) = -A$.\n\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\eta$ yields the desired relationship:\n$$ \\eta = \\frac{1}{2} (I - A) $$\nThis expression, known as the Parr-Pearson approximation for hardness, is the result for the first part of the task. The use of an equality sign is justified as this finite-difference formulation constitutes an operational definition of hardness within this conceptual framework.\n\nPart 2: Numerical evaluation of $\\eta$.\n\nFor the second part, we are given the following numerical values for a specific molecule:\n- Vertical ionization potential: $I = 9.47~\\text{eV}$\n- Vertical electron affinity: $A = 1.82~\\text{eV}$\n\nUsing the formula derived above, we can now calculate the global hardness, $\\eta$:\n$$ \\eta = \\frac{1}{2} (9.47~\\text{eV} - 1.82~\\text{eV}) $$\nPerforming the subtraction within the parentheses:\n$$ \\eta = \\frac{1}{2} (7.65~\\text{eV}) $$\nFinally, completing the calculation:\n$$ \\eta = 3.825~\\text{eV} $$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.

It presents a valid task in the field of conceptual Density Functional Theory (DFT). We proceed with the solution.\n\n### 1. Ionization Energy ($I$) and Electron Affinity ($A$) from Total Energies\n\nBy definition, the vertical ionization energy, $I$, is the energy required to remove one electron from a system of $N$ electrons at a fixed nuclear geometry. It is the energy difference between the ground state of the $(N-1)$-electron system and the $N$-electron system.\n\n$$I = E(N-1) - E(N)$$\n\nSimilarly, the vertical electron affinity, $A$, is the energy released when one electron is added to the $N$-electron system. It is the energy difference between the ground state of the $N$-electron system and the $(N+1)$-electron system. A positive value of $A$ indicates that the anion is stable relative to the neutral species.\n\n$$A = E(N) - E(N+1)$$\n\nThese expressions for $I$ and $A$ are exact within the given framework, assuming the provided energies $E(N-1)$, $E(N)$, and $E(N+1)$ are the true ground-state energies for the respective electron counts.\n\n### 2. Global Hardness ($\\eta$) from $I$ and $A$\n\nThe global chemical hardness, $\\eta$, is defined as half the second derivative of the energy $E$ with respect to the number of electrons $N$ at a constant external potential $v(\\mathbf{r})$.\n\n$$\\eta = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial N^2}\\right)_v$$\n\nTo evaluate this for an integer number of electrons, $N$, we must use a finite-difference approximation, as the function $E(N)$ is piecewise linear with discontinuous derivatives at integer $N$. We construct a symmetric second-order finite difference using a step size of $\\Delta N = 1$.\n\nThe first derivative, $\\left(\\partial E / \\partial N\\right)_v$, is the chemical potential, $\\mu$. At integer $N$, there are two one-sided derivatives:\n- The derivative from the right $(N \\to N+1)$: $\\mu^+ = \\frac{E(N+1)-E(N)}{(N+1)-N} = E(N+1)-E(N) = -A$.\n- The derivative from the left $(N \\to N-1)$: $\\mu^- = \\frac{E(N)-E(N-1)}{N-(N-1)} = E(N)-E(N-1) = -I$.\n\nThe second derivative is the rate of change of the first derivative. Using a central difference centered at $N$:\n\n$$\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 E}{\\partial N^2}\\right)_v \\approx \\frac{\\mu^+ - \\mu^-}{1} = (-A) - (-I) = I - A$$\n\nSubstituting this into the definition of hardness gives the expression for the hardness based on total energy differences, which we denote $\\eta_{\\Delta E}$:\n\n$$\\eta_{\\Delta E} = \\frac{1}{2}(I - A)$$\n\nCombining with the expressions for $I$ and $A$, we obtain:\n\n$$\\eta_{\\Delta E} = \\frac{1}{2}([E(N-1) - E(N)] - [E(N) - E(N+1)]) = \\frac{E(N-1) + E(N+1) - 2E(N)}{2}$$\n\nThis expression represents half of the energy gap for disproportionation ($2M \\rightarrow M^+ + M^-$).\n\n### 3. Approximations for $I$ and $A$ from Frontier Orbitals\n\nWithin the Kohn-Sham (KS) DFT framework, Janak's theorem states that the derivative of the total energy with respect to the occupation number $n_i$ of the $i$-th KS orbital is equal to the eigenvalue of that orbital, $\\epsilon_i$.\n\n$$\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial n_i} = \\epsilon_i$$\n\nFor the exact exchange-correlation (XC) functional, it can be shown that the ionization energy is precisely the negative of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy: $I = -\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HOMO}}$. However, the relationship for the electron affinity is complicated by the derivative discontinuity of the XC potential, $\\Delta_{xc}$, which causes the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{LUMO}}$, to shift discontinuously as its occupation changes from $0$ to a non-zero value.\n\nFor approximate XC functionals, such as the Local Density Approximation (LDA) and Generalized Gradient Approximations (GGAs), this derivative discontinuity is nearly zero. This leads to a severe underestimation of the fundamental gap ($I-A$) by the KS orbital gap ($\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{LUMO}}-\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HOMO}}$). Despite this known deficiency, a common practice is to adopt Koopmans'-like approximations for $I$ and $A$.\n\n**Assumption:** We assume that the XC functional used has a negligible derivative discontinuity. This allows for the approximation of the ionization energy and electron affinity directly from the HOMO and LUMO eigenvalues of the neutral $N$-electron system.\n\nUnder this assumption, we have:\n\n$$I_{\\mathrm{orb}} \\approx -\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HOMO}}$$\n$$A_{\\mathrm{orb}} \\approx -\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{LUMO}}$$\n\nUsing these orbital-based approximations for $I$ and $A$, we can define an orbital-based hardness, $\\eta_{\\mathrm{orb}}$:\n\n$$\\eta_{\\mathrm{orb}} = \\frac{1}{2}(I_{\\mathrm{orb}} - A_{\\mathrm{orb}}) = \\frac{1}{2}((-\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HOMO}}) - (-\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{LUMO}}))$$\n\n$$\\eta_{\\mathrm{orb}} = \\frac{\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{LUMO}} - \\epsilon_{\\mathrm{HOMO}}}{2}$$\n\nThis demonstrates that the hardness, under these approximations, is simply half the HOMO-LUMO gap. The discrepancy between $\\eta_{\\Delta E}$ and $\\eta_{\\mathrm{orb}}$ is a direct consequence of the deficiencies in the approximate XC functional, particularly its self-interaction error and lack of derivative discontinuity.\n\n### 4. Diagnostic Deviations\n\nTo quantify the difference between the two methods of calculating hardness, we use the diagnostic measures defined in the problem statement.\n\n- Absolute deviation in hardness:\n  $$\\Delta \\eta_{\\mathrm{abs}} = |\\eta_{\\Delta E} - \\eta_{\\mathrm{orb}}|$$\n\n- Relative deviation in hardness:\n  $$\\Delta \\eta_{\\mathrm{rel}} = \\frac{\\Delta \\eta_{\\mathrm{abs}}}{\\eta_{\\Delta E}}$$\nThis assumes $\\eta_{\\Delta E} \\neq 0$, which is true for all provided test cases, as the energy $E(N)$ is convex.\n\nThese metrics will now be computed for each test case using the derived formulae.", "answer": "[[4.200000,2.750000,1.450000,0.345238],[4.700000,3.450000,1.250000,0.265957],[5.000000,3.900000,1.100000,0.220000],[4.250000,2.250000,2.000000,0.470588],[3.500000,2.000000,1.500000,0.428571]]", "id": "2879242"}]}
