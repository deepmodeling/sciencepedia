Second, we analyze the qualitative behavior of this functional when used as an approximation for the non-additive noninteracting kinetic energy (NAKE) in subsystem Density Functional Theory (DFT), specifically in regions of overlapping electron densities.\n\n### Part 1: Derivation of the Thomas–Fermi Functional and the Constant $C_F$\n\nWe begin from the first principles given for a noninteracting, spin-unpolarized electron gas in a box of volume $V$ with periodic boundary conditions.\n\n1.  **Relationship between Electron Density $\\rho$ and Fermi Wavevector $k_{\\mathrm F}$**\n\n    The number of available one-electron states in an infinitesimal volume $d^3k$ of reciprocal space ($k$-space) is given by $V/(2\\pi)^3 d^3k$. Since electrons are fermions, each spatial orbital (defined by a wavevector $\\mathbf{k}$) can be occupied by two electrons with opposite spins (spin-degeneracy factor of $g_s=2$). At zero temperature, all states with wavevector magnitude $|\\mathbf{k}| \\le k_{\\mathrm F}$ are occupied, forming a Fermi sphere.\n\n    The total number of electrons $N$ is obtained by integrating the density of states over the volume of this Fermi sphere:\n    $$ N = g_s \\left( \\frac{V}{(2\\pi)^3} \\right) \\int_{|\\mathbf{k}| \\le k_{\\mathrm F}} d^3k $$\n    The integral is simply the volume of the Fermi sphere, which is $\\frac{4}{3}\\pi k_{\\mathrm F}^3$.\n    $$ N = 2 \\left( \\frac{V}{8\\pi^3} \\right) \\left( \\frac{4}{3}\\pi k_{\\mathrm F}^3 \\right) = \\frac{V}{3\\pi^2} k_{\\mathrm F}^3 $$\n    The electron density is $\\rho = N/V$. Thus, we establish the fundamental relationship between density and the Fermi wavevector for a uniform electron gas:\n    $$ \\rho = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm F}^3}{3\\pi^2} \\implies k_{\\mathrm F} = (3\\pi^2 \\rho)^{1/3} $$\n\n2.  **Derivation of the Kinetic Energy Density**\n\n    The problem states we are using atomic units, where $\\hbar=1$ and the electron mass $m_e=1$. The kinetic energy of a single electron in a plane-wave state $\\exp(i\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{r})$ is $\\frac{1}{2}k^2$. The total noninteracting kinetic energy, $T_s$, is the sum of the energies of all occupied states:\n    $$ T_s = g_s \\left( \\frac{V}{(2\\pi)^3} \\right) \\int_{|\\mathbf{k}| \\le k_{\\mathrm F}} \\frac{1}{2}k^2 d^3k $$\n    To evaluate this integral, we switch to spherical coordinates in $k$-space, where $d^3k = 4\\pi k^2 dk$:\n    $$ T_s = 2 \\left( \\frac{V}{8\\pi^3} \\right) \\int_0^{k_{\\mathrm F}} \\left( \\frac{1}{2}k^2 \\right) (4\\pi k^2) dk = \\frac{V}{2\\pi^2} \\int_0^{k_{\\mathrm F}} k^4 dk $$\n    Performing the integration:\n    $$ T_s = \\frac{V}{2\\pi^2} \\left[ \\frac{k^5}{5} \\right]_0^{k_{\\mathrm F}} = \\frac{V}{10\\pi^2} k_{\\mathrm F}^5 $$\n    To obtain the kinetic energy density, $\\tau_s = T_s/V$, we have:\n    $$ \\tau_s = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm F}^5}{10\\pi^2} $$\n    Now, we express $\\tau_s$ as a function of the density $\\rho$ by substituting $k_{\\mathrm F} = (3\\pi^2 \\rho)^{1/3}$:\n    $$ \\tau_s(\\rho) = \\frac{1}{10\\pi^2} \\left( (3\\pi^2 \\rho)^{1/3} \\right)^5 = \\frac{1}{10\\pi^2} (3\\pi^2)^{5/3} \\rho^{5/3} $$\n    Simplifying the constant factor:\n    $$ \\frac{(3\\pi^2)^{5/3}}{10\\pi^2} = \\frac{(3\\pi^2) \\cdot (3\\pi^2)^{2/3}}{10\\pi^2} = \\frac{3}{10}(3\\pi^2)^{2/3} $$\n    This gives the kinetic energy density for the uniform electron gas, known as the Thomas–Fermi kinetic energy density:\n    $$ \\tau_s^{\\mathrm{TF}}(\\rho) = \\frac{3}{10}(3\\pi^2)^{2/3} \\rho^{5/3} $$\n    The Thomas–Fermi functional is given by the Local Density Approximation (LDA) applied to the kinetic energy, which assumes this local relationship holds for non-uniform densities $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$:\n    $$ T_s^{\\mathrm{TF}}[\\rho] = \\int \\tau_s^{\\mathrm{TF}}(\\rho(\\mathbf{r})) d^3r = \\int C_F \\rho(\\mathbf{r})^{5/3} d^3r $$\n    By comparison, we identify the constant $C_F$:\n    $$ C_F = \\frac{3}{10}(3\\pi^2)^{2/3} $$\n\n### Part 2: Analysis of the Thomas–Fermi NAKE Functional\n\nThe non-additive noninteracting kinetic energy (NAKE) is defined as:\n$$ T_s^{\\mathrm{nadd}}[\\rho_A,\\rho_B] \\equiv T_s[\\rho_A+\\rho_B] - T_s[\\rho_A] - T_s[\\rho_B] $$\nThis term accounts for the kinetic energy change arising from the Pauli exclusion principle when two electron distributions $\\rho_A$ and $\\rho_B$ overlap. Within the Thomas–Fermi approximation:\n$$ T_s^{\\mathrm{nadd, TF}}[\\rho_A, \\rho_B] = C_F \\int \\left( (\\rho_A(\\mathbf{r}) + \\rho_B(\\mathbf{r}))^{5/3} - \\rho_A(\\mathbf{r})^{5/3} - \\rho_B(\\mathbf{r})^{5/3} \\right) d^3r $$\n\n**Qualitative Behavior and Limitations:**\n\n1.  **Positivity and Convexity:** The function $f(x) = x^{p}$ with $p = 5/3 > 1$ is strictly convex for $x > 0$. A property of such functions is that $(a+b)^p > a^p + b^p$ for any $a,b > 0$. Therefore, the integrand $(\\rho_A + \\rho_B)^{5/3} - \\rho_A^{5/3} - \\rho_B^{5/3}$ is strictly positive wherever both $\\rho_A$ and $\\rho_B$ are non-zero. Consequently, $T_s^{\\mathrm{nadd, TF}}$ is always positive. This correctly captures the repulsive nature of the Pauli principle, which increases the system's kinetic energy upon density overlap.\n\n2.  **Locality and Underestimation:** The Thomas–Fermi model is derived for a uniform electron gas and is a purely *local* functional, meaning the kinetic energy at a point $\\mathbf{r}$ depends only on the density $\\rho$ at that same point. The true kinetic energy, however, is highly non-local and depends on the entire orbital structure. In regions of significant density overlap, such as covalent bonds, the density changes rapidly. The TF approximation, lacking any information about density gradients or orbital structures, cannot capture the complex spatial features of the true Pauli repulsion potential (the \"Pauli barrier\"). It is a well-documented failure of the TF NAKE that it severely *underestimates* the magnitude of this repulsion.\n\n3.  **Failure in the One-Orbital Limit:** Consider a system described by a single orbital $\\psi$, such as a hydrogen atom. The exact NAKE must be zero for any partitioning of its density $\\rho = |\\psi|^2$ into two fictitious subsystems $\\rho_A = f\\rho$ and $\\rho_B = (1-f)\\rho$ (where $0  f  1$), because there is no inter-subsystem Pauli exclusion to account for. However, the TF functional gives a non-zero, positive NAKE: $T_s^{\\text{nadd, TF}} = C_F (1-f^{5/3}-(1-f)^{5/3}) \\int \\rho^{5/3} d^3r > 0$. This catastrophic failure demonstrates its inability to correctly describe systems with few electrons or orbitals.\n\n4.  **Consequences for Bonding and Charge Transfer:** Because the TF NAKE underestimates the Pauli repulsion, using it in a FDE calculation allows subsystems to overlap too much. In covalent bonds, this leads to an inaccurate description of the bond length and energy. For weakly interacting systems, the underestimated repulsion can lead to spurious charge transfer from one subsystem to another, as the kinetic energy cost for this process is not properly accounted for.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n*   **A) $C_F = \\dfrac{3}{10}\\left(3\\pi^2\\right)^{2/3}$; as a NAKE in overlap regions, the Thomas–Fermi form is strictly local and positive by convexity, but it generally underestimates the magnitude and the spatial structure of the Pauli barrier, fails in the one-orbital limit, and performs poorly for covalent bonding and charge-transfer situations.**\n    The value of $C_F$ is correct as per our derivation. The qualitative assessment accurately describes the positivity of the functional, its local nature, and its well-known failures: underestimation of the Pauli barrier, failure in the one-orbital limit, and poor performance for covalent bonds and charge-transfer systems.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **B) $C_F = \\dfrac{3}{5}\\left(3\\pi^2\\right)^{2/3}$; as a NAKE in overlap regions, the Thomas–Fermi form becomes exact because the density is high and approximately uniform, so it correctly captures the Pauli barrier even for covalent bonds.**\n    The constant $C_F$ is incorrect ($3/5$ instead of $3/10$).

The qualitative assessment is also incorrect; the TF NAKE is positive (repulsive), not negative (attractive).\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **D) $C_F = \\dfrac{3}{10}\\left(6\\pi^2\\right)^{2/3}$; as a NAKE in overlap regions, the Thomas–Fermi form severely overestimates the Pauli repulsion barrier and generally prevents charge transfer even in weakly interacting complexes.**\n    The constant $C_F$ is incorrect; it contains $(6\\pi^2)^{2/3}$, which is related to spin-density functionals, not the spin-unpolarized total density functional requested. The qualitative assessment is also incorrect; the TF NAKE *underestimates* the Pauli repulsion, it does not overestimate it.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2893022"}, {"introduction": "Beyond the choice of the non-additive kinetic energy functional, subsystem DFT inherits the intrinsic errors of the underlying approximate exchange-correlation functionals.

We introduce a Lagrangian with a single Lagrange multiplier $\\mu$:\n$$\nL_{1}[\\rho_{A}, \\rho_{B}, \\mu] = E[\\rho_{A}+\\rho_{B}] - \\mu \\left( \\int (\\rho_{A}(\\mathbf{r}) + \\rho_{B}(\\mathbf{r})) d\\mathbf{r} - N \\right).\n$$\nThe variational principle, $\\frac{\\delta L_{1}}{\\delta \\rho_{A}(\\mathbf{r})} = 0$, yields the Euler-Lagrange equation for subsystem $A$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta E[\\rho_{A}+\\rho_{B}]}{\\delta \\rho_{A}(\\mathbf{r})} - \\mu = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{\\delta E[\\rho_{A}+\\rho_{B}]}{\\delta \\rho_{A}(\\mathbf{r})} = \\mu.\n$$\nThis result states that at equilibrium, the effective potential is constant everywhere and equal to the global chemical potential $\\mu$. To connect this to the subsystem KS scheme, the subsystem chemical potential $C_A$ must equal this global chemical potential $\\mu$. Therefore, the subsystem Euler-Lagrange equation for this case is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta T_{s}[\\rho_{A}]}{\\delta \\rho_{A}(\\mathbf{r})} + v_{\\mathrm{KS}}^{A}[\\rho_{A}](\\mathbf{r}) + v_{\\mathrm{emb}}^{A}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\mu.\n$$\n\nCase $2$: Separate electron-number constraints.\nWe minimize $E[\\rho_{A}+\\rho_{B}]$ subject to two constraints, $\\int \\rho_{A}(\\mathbf{r}) d\\mathbf{r} = N_{A}$ and $\\int \\rho_{B}(\\mathbf{r}) d\\mathbf{r} = N_{B}$. The Lagrangian involves two distinct multipliers, $\\lambda_{A}$ and $\\lambda_{B}$:\n$$\nL_{2}[\\rho_{A}, \\rho_{B}, \\lambda_{A}, \\lambda_{B}] = E[\\rho_{A}+\\rho_{B}] - \\lambda_{A} \\left( \\int \\rho_{A}(\\mathbf{r}) d\\mathbf{r} - N_{A} \\right) - \\lambda_{B} \\left( \\int \\rho_{B}(\\mathbf{r}) d\\mathbf{r} - N_{B} \\right).\n$$\nThe variational condition with respect to $\\rho_{A}(\\mathbf{r})$, $\\frac{\\delta L_{2}}{\\delta \\rho_{A}(\\mathbf{r})} = 0$, now gives:\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta E[\\rho_{A}+\\rho_{B}]}{\\delta \\rho_{A}(\\mathbf{r})} - \\lambda_{A} = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\frac{\\delta E[\\rho_{A}+\\rho_{B}]}{\\delta \\rho_{A}(\\mathbf{r})} = \\lambda_{A}.\n$$\nIn this scenario, the effective potential for subsystem $A$ is constant and equal to its specific chemical potential $\\lambda_{A}$. The corresponding subsystem Euler-Lagrange equation, written in terms of the modified embedding potential $\\tilde{v}_{\\mathrm{emb}}^{A}(\\mathbf{r})$, is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta T_{s}[\\rho_{A}]}{\\delta \\rho_{A}(\\mathbf{r})} + v_{\\mathrm{KS}}^{A}[\\rho_{A}](\\mathbf{r}) + \\tilde{v}_{\\mathrm{emb}}^{A}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\lambda_{A}.\n$$\n\nDerivation of the relationship between $v_{\\mathrm{emb}}^{A}$ and $\\tilde{v}_{\\mathrm{emb}}^{A}$.\nWe now have two formal expressions for the subsystem Euler-Lagrange equation, corresponding to the two different constraint schemes. For the purpose of finding the formal modification to the potential, we treat the component terms as formally equivalent.\nFrom Case $1$, we can write:\n$$\n\\frac{\\delta T_{s}[\\rho_{A}]}{\\delta \\rho_{A}(\\mathbf{r})} + v_{\\mathrm{KS}}^{A}[\\rho_{A}](\\mathbf{r}) = \\mu - v_{\\mathrm{emb}}^{A}(\\mathbf{r}).\n$$\nThis expression isolates the parts of the effective potential corresponding to an isolated non-interacting subsystem $A$. Substituting this into the equation for Case $2$:\n$$\n\\left( \\mu - v_{\\mathrm{emb}}^{A}(\\mathbf{r}) \\right) + \\tilde{v}_{\\mathrm{emb}}^{A}(\\mathbf{r}) = \\lambda_{A}.\n$$\nRearranging this equation to solve for the modified embedding potential, $\\tilde{v}_{\\mathrm{emb}}^{A}(\\mathbf{r})$, yields the desired closed-form expression:\n$$\n\\tilde{v}_{\\mathrm{emb}}^{A}(\\mathbf{r}) = v_{\\mathrm{emb}}^{A}(\\mathbf{r}) + \\lambda_{A} - \\mu.\n$$\n\nConclusion on Charge Localization.\nThe derived expression shows that enforcing a specific integer-electron count $N_A$ on subsystem $A$ corresponds to applying a constant potential shift, $\\Delta v = \\lambda_{A} - \\mu$, to the embedding potential.\nThe global chemical potential $\\mu$ represents the energy level at which electrons would naturally equilibrate between subsystems $A$ and $B$ to minimize the total energy, leading to generally non-integer populations.\nThe multiplier $\\lambda_{A}$ acts as an externally applied bias potential. It is the specific chemical potential required to force the electron count on subsystem $A$ to be exactly $N_{A}$.\nThe difference, $\\lambda_{A} - \\mu$, represents the energy cost or gain for moving an electron to subsystem $A$ relative to the global equilibrium.\nIf $\\lambda_{A} > \\mu$, the additive potential shift is positive. The shift $\\Delta v$ is a chemical potential bias that modifies the relative energy levels of subsystem $A$ versus $B$, thereby driving the charge to partition according to the specified constraints $\\int \\rho_A(\\mathbf{r}) d\\mathbf{r} = N_A$ and $\\int \\rho_B(\\mathbf{r}) d\\mathbf{r} = N_B$. This demonstrates that the Lagrange multiplier technique provides a direct mechanism to enforce and control charge localization in subsystem DFT. If more electrons need to be localized on $A$ than in the unconstrained case, $\\lambda_A$ will be higher than $\\mu$ and this shift acts to accommodate this. Conversely, if fewer electrons are desired on $A$, $\\lambda_A$ will be lower than $\\mu$. Thus, the additive modification directly controls the charge localization.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\tilde{v}_{\\mathrm{emb}}^{A}(\\mathbf{r}) = v_{\\mathrm{emb}}^{A}(\\mathbf{r}) + \\lambda_{A} - \\mu}\n$$", "id": "2892987"}]}
