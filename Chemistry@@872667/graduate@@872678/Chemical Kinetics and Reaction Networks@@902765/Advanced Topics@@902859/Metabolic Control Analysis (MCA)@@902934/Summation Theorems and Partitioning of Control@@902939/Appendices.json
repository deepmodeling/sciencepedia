The problem is self-contained and provides all necessary information to compute the requested control coefficients using the fundamental theorems of MCA.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe analysis of flux control in a metabolic pathway is governed by the theorems of Metabolic Control Analysis. For the given linear pathway with a single intermediate, $X$, we begin by stating the steady-state condition. At steady state, the concentration of the intermediate $[X]$ is constant, which requires that its rate of formation equals its rate of consumption. This implies that the net rates of the two reactions, $v_1$ and $v_2$, must be equal to each other and to the overall pathway flux, $J$.\n$$v_1 = v_2 = J$$\n\nThe distribution of flux control among the enzymes of the pathway is described by two fundamental theorems for this system: the Summation Theorem and the Connectivity Theorem.\n\nThe Flux Control Summation Theorem states that the sum of all flux control coefficients in a pathway is equal to unity. For our two-enzyme system, this is written as:\n$$C_{1}^{J} + C_{2}^{J} = 1$$\n\nThe Flux Control Connectivity Theorem relates the control coefficients to the elasticities of the enzymes with respect to the common intermediate. For a system with a single intermediate $X$, the theorem states:\n$$C_{1}^{J} \\varepsilon_{1}^{X} + C_{2}^{J} \\varepsilon_{2}^{X} = 0$$\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns, $C_{1}^{J}$ and $C_{2}^{J}$.\n1. $C_{1}^{J} + C_{2}^{J} = 1$\n2. $C_{1}^{J} \\varepsilon_{1}^{X} + C_{2}^{J} \\varepsilon_{2}^{X} = 0$\n\nFrom equation (1), we can express $C_{1}^{J}$ in terms of $C_{2}^{J}$:\n$$C_{1}^{J} = 1 - C_{2}^{J}$$\nSubstituting this expression into equation (2):\n$$(1 - C_{2}^{J}) \\varepsilon_{1}^{X} + C_{2}^{J} \\varepsilon_{2}^{X} = 0$$\nExpanding the equation:\n$$\\varepsilon_{1}^{X} - C_{2}^{J} \\varepsilon_{1}^{X} + C_{2}^{J} \\varepsilon_{2}^{X} = 0$$\nSolving for $C_{2}^{J}$:\n$$C_{2}^{J} (\\varepsilon_{2}^{X} - \\varepsilon_{1}^{X}) = -\\varepsilon_{1}^{X}$$\n$$C_{2}^{J} = \\frac{-\\varepsilon_{1}^{X}}{\\varepsilon_{2}^{X} - \\varepsilon_{1}^{X}}$$\nSubstituting the given elasticity values, $\\varepsilon_{1}^{X} = -0.98$ and $\\varepsilon_{2}^{X} = +0.10$:\n$$C_{2}^{J} = \\frac{-(-0.98)}{0.10 - (-0.98)} = \\frac{0.98}{0.10 + 0.98} = \\frac{0.98}{1.08}$$\nNumerically, this is $C_{2}^{J} \\approx 0.9074074...$.\n\nNow, we use the summation theorem to find $C_{1}^{J}$:\n$$C_{1}^{J} = 1 - C_{2}^{J} = 1 - \\frac{0.98}{1.08} = \\frac{1.08 - 0.98}{1.08} = \\frac{0.10}{1.08}$$\nNumerically, this is $C_{1}^{J} \\approx 0.0925925...$.\n\nRounding each entry to four significant figures as requested:\n$C_{1}^{J} = 0.09259$\n$C_{2}^{J} = 0.9074$\n\nThe thermodynamic explanation for this distribution of control is as follows. The calculated control coefficients, $C_{1}^{J} \\approx 0.09$ and $C_{2}^{J} \\approx 0.91$, indicate that enzyme $E_2$ exerts almost all control over the pathway flux ($91\\%$), while $E_1$ exerts very little control ($9\\%$). This result is a direct consequence of the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the reactions they catalyze.\n\nThe first reaction, catalyzed by $E_1$, is near equilibrium, as indicated by its small Gibbs free energy change, $\\Delta G_1 \\approx -0.5\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$. A near-equilibrium reaction is characterized by forward and reverse rates that are large and nearly equal. Such a reaction is highly sensitive to perturbations in the concentrations of its substrates and products. This high sensitivity is reflected in the large magnitude of its elasticity coefficient, $|\\varepsilon_{1}^{X}| = |-0.98| = 0.98$. If the activity of $E_1$ were to increase, it would tend to increase the net flux $v_1$. However, this would also cause the concentration of the intermediate $[X]$ to rise. Due to the high elasticity, this small rise in $[X]$ strongly inhibits the net reaction $v_1$ (either by slowing the forward rate or accelerating the reverse rate), effectively buffering the pathway flux against the initial perturbation. The system rapidly adjusts $[X]$ to keep the first reaction near equilibrium, thereby minimizing the impact of changes in $E_1$ on the overall flux $J$.\n\nConversely, the second reaction, catalyzed by $E_2$, is far from equilibrium, as shown by its large, negative Gibbs free energy change, $\\Delta G_2 \\approx -25\\,\\text{kJ mol}^{-1}$. Such a reaction is effectively kinetically irreversible. Its rate is much less sensitive to changes in the concentrations of its substrates or products, which is reflected in the small magnitude of its elasticity coefficient, $|\\varepsilon_{2}^{X}| = |+0.10| = 0.10$. Because the rate $v_2$ is insensitive to the concentration of its substrate $[X]$, any change in the activity of enzyme $E_2$ is not significantly counteracted by changes in $[X]$. Therefore, a change in the concentration or catalytic activity of $E_2$ translates almost directly into a proportional change in the pathway flux $J$. This makes the irreversible step the primary point of control, or the \"rate-limiting\" step in classical terminology.\n\nIn summary, control resides in the kinetically irreversible steps of a pathway. The near-equilibrium reaction catalyzed by $E_1$ is poised to respond to changes but does not control the steady-state flux, whereas the far-from-equilibrium reaction catalyzed by $E_2$ acts as the bottleneck and therefore holds the majority of the flux control. The calculated distribution of control coefficients provides quantitative confirmation of this fundamental principle of metabolic regulation.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.09259 & 0.9074\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2681274"}, {"introduction": "Real metabolic networks are rarely simple linear chains, making it crucial to understand how control is partitioned at branch points.

The concentration of $M$ is itself a function of all enzyme activities, including $e_0$. That is, $V_1 = V_1(M(e_0, e_1, e_2), e_1)$ and $V_2 = V_2(M(e_0, e_1, e_2), e_2)$.\nWe are considering a perturbation in $e_0$ while keeping $e_1$ and $e_2$ constant. Thus, the total derivatives of the branch fluxes with respect to $e_0$ are given by the chain rule:\n$$ \\frac{dV_1}{de_0} = \\frac{\\partial V_1}{\\partial M} \\frac{dM}{de_0} $$\n$$ \\frac{dV_2}{de_0} = \\frac{\\partial V_2}{\\partial M} \\frac{dM}{de_0} $$\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions back into the definitions for the control coefficients:\n$$ C_0^{J_1} = \\frac{e_0}{V_1} \\left( \\frac{\\partial V_1}{\\partial M} \\frac{dM}{de_0} \\right) $$\n$$ C_0^{J_2} = \\frac{e_0}{V_2} \\left( \\frac{\\partial V_2}{\\partial M} \\frac{dM}{de_0} \\right) $$\n\nWe are asked for the ratio $C_0^{J_1}/C_0^{J_2}$. Taking the ratio of the two expressions above, we find that the common terms cancel:\n$$ \\frac{C_0^{J_1}}{C_0^{J_2}} = \\frac{\\frac{e_0}{V_1} \\frac{\\partial V_1}{\\partial M} \\frac{dM}{de_0}}{\\frac{e_0}{V_2} \\frac{\\partial V_2}{\\partial M} \\frac{dM}{de_0}} = \\frac{V_2}{V_1} \\frac{\\frac{\\partial V_1}{\\partial M}}{\\frac{\\partial V_2}{\\partial M}} $$\nThis cancellation is valid provided that $\\frac{dM}{de_0} \\neq 0$, which is true for any non-trivial control. If $\\frac{dM}{de_0}=0$, then both control coefficients are zero, and the ratio is indeterminate.\n\nThe problem asks for the result in terms of the scaled elasticities $\\varepsilon_M^{v_i}$. The definition is $\\varepsilon_{M}^{v_i} = \\frac{M}{V_i} \\frac{\\partial V_i}{\\partial M}$. We can rearrange this to express the partial derivatives:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial V_i}{\\partial M} = \\varepsilon_M^{v_i} \\frac{V_i}{M} $$\nSubstituting these for $i=1$ and $i=2$ into our expression for the ratio:\n$$ \\frac{C_0^{J_1}}{C_0^{J_2}} = \\frac{V_2}{V_1} \\frac{\\varepsilon_M^{v_1} \\frac{V_1}{M}}{\\varepsilon_M^{v_2} \\frac{V_2}{M}} $$\nThe terms $V_1$, $V_2$, and $M$ cancel out, leading to a remarkably simple result:\n$$ \\frac{C_0^{J_1}}{C_0^{J_2}} = \\frac{\\varepsilon_M^{v_1}}{\\varepsilon_M^{v_2}} $$\nThis expression depends only on the elasticities of the two branch enzymes with respect to the common intermediate $M$. It does not explicitly depend on $\\varepsilon_M^{v_0}$ or the steady-state fluxes $V_0$, $V_1$, $V_2$, as these factors have cancelled during the derivation.\n\nThe second part of the problem asks for the necessary and sufficient condition under which the control coefficients $C_0^{J_1}$ and $C_0^{J_2}$ have opposite signs. This occurs if and only if their ratio is negative:\n$$ \\frac{C_0^{J_1}}{C_0^{J_2}} < 0 $$\nSubstituting our derived result:\n$$ \\frac{\\varepsilon_M^{v_1}}{\\varepsilon_M^{v_2}} < 0 $$\nThis inequality is satisfied if and only if the two elasticities $\\varepsilon_M^{v_1}$ and $\\varepsilon_M^{v_2}$ have opposite signs (i.e., one is positive and the other is negative), assuming neither is zero.\nThus, the necessary and sufficient condition is $\\varepsilon_M^{v_1} \\cdot \\varepsilon_M^{v_2} < 0$.\n\nPhysically, $\\varepsilon_M^{v_i}$ represents the sensitivity of reaction rate $v_i$ to a change in the concentration of metabolite $M$. For the consuming reactions $v_1$ and $v_2$, $M$ is a substrate, so we typically expect $\\varepsilon_M^{v_1} > 0$ and $\\varepsilon_M^{v_2} > 0$. In this case, the control coefficients have the same sign. An opposite sign requires that $M$ acts as a substrate for one branch (e.g., $\\varepsilon_M^{v_1} > 0$) but as an inhibitor for the other branch (e.g., $\\varepsilon_M^{v_2} < 0$). This occurs in cases of substrate inhibition or allosteric regulation.\nThe final answer requested is the expression for the ratio.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{\\varepsilon_{M}^{v_1}}{\\varepsilon_{M}^{v_2}}} $$", "id": "2681235"}]}
