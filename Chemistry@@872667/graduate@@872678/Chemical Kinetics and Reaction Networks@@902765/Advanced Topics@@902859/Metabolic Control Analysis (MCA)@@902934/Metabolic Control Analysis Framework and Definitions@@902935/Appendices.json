The definition of elasticity is given as:\n$$\n\\epsilon^{v}_{x} = \\frac{\\partial \\ln v}{\\partial \\ln x}\n$$\nThis form is most direct for calculation. The rate law for the reaction is:\n$$\nv(x, E) = E V_{\\max} \\frac{x}{K_{M} + x}\n$$\nwhere the parameters $E$, $V_{\\max}$, and $K_{M}$ are treated as constants for the purpose of this partial differentiation. To compute the elasticity, we first take the natural logarithm of the rate expression, $v$:\n$$\n\\ln v = \\ln \\left( E V_{\\max} \\frac{x}{K_{M} + x} \\right)\n$$\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can expand this expression:\n$$\n\\ln v = \\ln(E V_{\\max}) + \\ln(x) - \\ln(K_{M} + x)\n$$\nThe elasticity $\\epsilon^{v}_{x}$ is the derivative of $\\ln v$ with respect to $\\ln x$.

The rate $v$ becomes independent of $x$. This is consistent with the behavior of the Michaelis-Menten rate law at substrate saturation ($x \\gg K_{M}$), where the rate approaches its maximum value, $v \\approx E V_{\\max}$, and the enzyme is saturated.\n\nThe derived expression correctly captures the transition from first-order kinetics at low substrate concentrations to zero-order kinetics at high substrate concentrations.
