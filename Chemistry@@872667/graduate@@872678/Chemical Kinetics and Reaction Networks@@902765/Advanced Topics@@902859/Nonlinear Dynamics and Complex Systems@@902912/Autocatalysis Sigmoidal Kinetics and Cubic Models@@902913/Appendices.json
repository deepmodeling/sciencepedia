It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. Therefore, the problem is valid, and we shall proceed with its formal derivation and solution.\n\nFirst, we must establish the system of differential equations that describe the dynamics of the concentrations of species $A$ and $X$. The problem states the system is governed by the elementary reaction:\n$$A + X \\xrightarrow{k} 2X$$\nAccording to the law of mass action for an elementary reaction, the reaction rate, $r$, is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the reactants. Let $a(t)$ and $x(t)$ be the concentrations of species $A$ and $X$, respectively. The rate is given by:\n$$r = k a(t) x(t)$$\nwhere $k$ is the positive rate constant.\n\nThe rate of change of the concentration of each species is determined by the reaction stoichiometry. Species $A$ is consumed in the reaction, so its concentration decreases at a rate $r$. Species $X$ is both consumed (one molecule) and produced (two molecules), resulting in a net production of one molecule of $X$. Thus, its concentration increases at a rate $r$. This gives us the following system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs):\n$$\n\\frac{da}{dt} = -k a(t) x(t)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = k a(t) x(t)\n$$\n\nThe problem specifies a batch reactor with no inflow or outflow. This implies a conservation law. By summing the two differential equations, we observe:\n$$\n\\frac{da}{dt} + \\frac{dx}{dt} = -k a(t) x(t) + k a(t) x(t) = 0\n$$\nThis can be rewritten as:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dt} (a(t) + x(t)) = 0\n$$\nIntegrating this equation with respect to time yields that the sum of the concentrations is a constant:\n$$\na(t) + x(t) = C\n$$\nWe can determine the constant $C$ from the initial conditions, $a(0) = a_{0}$ and $x(0) = x_{0}$.\n$$\nC = a(0) + x(0) = a_{0} + x_{0}\n$$\nLet us denote this total concentration as $M = a_{0} + x_{0}$. This conservation law allows us to express the concentration of $A$ in terms of the concentration of $X$:\n$$\na(t) = M - x(t)\n$$\n\nNow, we can derive the single kinetic equation for $x(t)$ by substituting the expression for $a(t)$ into the rate equation for $x(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{dx}{dt} = k (M - x(t)) x(t)\n$$\nThis is the logistic differential equation, which is known to produce sigmoidal (S-shaped) solution curves, characteristic of autocatalytic growth.\n\nThe next step is to non-dimensionalize this equation. We introduce dimensionless variables for concentration, $u$, and time, $\\tau$. Let $x = x_{char} u$ and $t = t_{char} \\tau$, where $x_{char}$ is a characteristic concentration and $t_{char}$ is a characteristic time. Using the chain rule, $\\frac{dx}{dt} = \\frac{dx}{du}\\frac{du}{d\\tau}\\frac{d\\tau}{dt} = x_{char} \\frac{du}{d\\tau} \\frac{1}{t_{char}}$. Substituting these into the ODE for $x(t)$:\n$$\n\\frac{x_{char}}{t_{char}} \\frac{du}{d\\tau} = k (M - x_{char} u) (x_{char} u)\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{du}{d\\tau} = k t_{char} x_{char} \\left( \\frac{M}{x_{char}} - u \\right) u\n$$\nTo obtain a parameter-free ODE, we must choose $x_{char}$ and $t_{char}$ to eliminate the constants. A natural choice for the characteristic concentration is the total constant concentration $M = a_{0} + x_{0}$. Let $x_{char} = M$. The equation becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{d\\tau} = k t_{char} M (1 - u) u\n$$\nTo make the equation parameter-free, we set the group of constants to unity: $k t_{char} M = 1$. This defines the characteristic time:\n$$\nt_{char} = \\frac{1}{kM} = \\frac{1}{k(a_{0} + x_{0})}\n$$\nWith these choices for $x_{char}$ and $t_{char}$, the dimensionless state equation is:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{d\\tau} = u(1 - u)\n$$\nThe dimensionless initial concentration, $u_{0}$, is found from the initial condition $x(0) = x_{0}$:\n$$\nu(0) = u_{0} = \\frac{x(0)}{x_{char}} = \\frac{x_{0}}{M} = \\frac{x_{0}}{a_{0} + x_{0}}\n$$\nWe must now solve the initial-value problem:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{d\\tau} = u(1 - u), \\quad u(0) = u_{0}\n$$\nThis is a separable differential equation. We can rearrange it as:\n$$\n\\frac{du}{u(1 - u)} = d\\tau\n$$\nWe integrate both sides from the initial state $(\\tau=0, u=u_{0})$ to a general state $(\\tau, u(\\tau))$:\n$$\n\\int_{u_{0}}^{u(\\tau)} \\frac{d\\tilde{u}}{\\tilde{u}(1 - \\tilde{u})} = \\int_{0}^{\\tau} d\\tilde{\\tau}\n$$\nThe integral on the right is simply $\\tau$. For the integral on the left, we use partial fraction decomposition:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tilde{u}(1 - \\tilde{u})} = \\frac{1}{\\tilde{u}} + \\frac{1}{1 - \\tilde{u}}\n$$\nSo the left-hand side integral becomes:\n$$\n\\int_{u_{0}}^{u(\\tau)} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\tilde{u}} + \\frac{1}{1 - \\tilde{u}} \\right) d\\tilde{u} = \\left[ \\ln|\\tilde{u}| - \\ln|1 - \\tilde{u}| \\right]_{u_{0}}^{u(\\tau)} = \\left[ \\ln\\left|\\frac{\\tilde{u}}{1 - \\tilde{u}}\\right| \\right]_{u_{0}}^{u(\\tau)}\n$$\nSince $x_{0}  0$ and $a_{0}  0$, we have $0  x_{0}  M$, which implies $0  u_{0}  1$. The concentration $x(t)$ cannot exceed $M$, so $0  u(\\tau)  1$ for all $\\tau \\ge 0$. The absolute value signs can be dropped.\n$$\n\\ln\\left(\\frac{u(\\tau)}{1 - u(\\tau)}\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\frac{u_{0}}{1 - u_{0}}\\right) = \\tau\n$$\nNow, we solve for $u(\\tau)$.

This constraint is crucial; it ensures that for any concentration $x$ within the integration interval $[x_0, \\theta]$, the value of $x$ is small. This smallness allows the Taylor series expansion of the integrand, $1/f(x)$, about $x=0$ to provide a valid approximation. The dominant behavior of the integral will be determined by the most singular term in this expansion.\n\nWe begin by factoring the denominator $f(x)$ to isolate the behavior near $x=0$:\n$$\nf(x) = \\lambda x \\left(1 + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\lambda}x - \\frac{\\beta}{\\lambda}x^2\\right)\n$$\nThe integrand is therefore\n$$\n\\frac{1}{f(x)} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda x} \\left(1 + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\lambda}x - \\frac{\\beta}{\\lambda}x^2\\right)^{-1}\n$$\nLet's define $u(x) = \\frac{\\alpha}{\\lambda}x - \\frac{\\beta}{\\lambda}x^2$.

These inequalities imply that $|\\frac{\\alpha}{\\lambda}x| \\ll 1$ and $|\\frac{\\beta}{\\lambda}x^2| \\ll 1$, which in turn means $|u(x)| \\ll 1$. This rigorously justifies the use of the geometric series expansion $(1+u)^{-1} = 1 - u + O(u^2)$. Applying this expansion, we get:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{f(x)} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda x} \\left[ 1 - \\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\lambda}x - \\frac{\\beta}{\\lambda}x^2\\right) + O(x^2) \\right]\n$$\nWe only need to retain terms that will contribute to the leading-order behavior after integration.
