Since we are interested in a positive fixed point where $x > 0$, this simplifies to $B - xy = 0$, which implies $x^{2}y = Bx$.\n\nNow, we substitute this result, $x^{2}y = Bx$, into the first equation:\n$$\nA - (B+1)x_{\\mathrm{ss}} + Bx_{\\mathrm{ss}} = 0\n$$\n$$\nA - Bx_{\\mathrm{ss}} - x_{\\mathrm{ss}} + Bx_{\\mathrm{ss}} = 0\n$$\n$$\nA - x_{\\mathrm{ss}} = 0\n$$\nThis yields the steady-state concentration for $x$:\n$$\nx_{\\mathrm{ss}} = A\n$$\nUsing the relation $B - xy = 0$, we can find the corresponding steady-state concentration for $y$:\n$$\ny_{\\mathrm{ss}} = \\frac{B}{x_{\\mathrm{ss}}} = \\frac{B}{A}\n$$\nThus, the unique positive fixed point of the system is $(x_{\\mathrm{ss}}, y_{\\mathrm{ss}}) = (A, B/A)$. Since $A>0$ and $B>0$ are given, this fixed point is indeed always in the positive quadrant of the phase space.\n\nNext, to analyze the local stability of this fixed point, we compute the Jacobian matrix $J$ of the system, which is defined as:\n$$\nJ(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = -(B+1) + 2xy\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = x^{2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} = B - 2xy\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} = -x^{2}\n$$\nSo the Jacobian matrix is:\n$$\nJ(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2xy - B - 1  x^{2} \\\\ B - 2xy  -x^{2} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we evaluate this Jacobian matrix at the fixed point $(x_{\\mathrm{ss}}, y_{\\mathrm{ss}}) = (A, B/A)$.

A saddle-node bifurcation occurs when a steady state becomes non-hyperbolic, which corresponds to the condition $J(x_s) = 0$. This implies that a new pair of steady states (one stable, one unstable) is created or an existing pair annihilates. At the bifurcation point, the steady state $x_s$ is a double root of the steady-state equation.\n\nTherefore, the conditions for a saddle-node bifurcation are that both $f(x_s) = 0$ and $J(x_s) = 0$ are satisfied simultaneously for some value of the bifurcation parameter $b$.

The problem implies two such bifurcations exist, so we assume $k_1^2 a^2 - 3k_2 k_4 > 0$. Both roots for $x_s$ are positive since $k_1 a > \\sqrt{k_1^2 a^2 - 3k_2 k_4}$, which is physically required for a concentration.\n\nNext, we find the two corresponding values of $b$. From equation $(1)$, we can express $b$ in terms of $x_s$:\n$$k_3 b = k_2 x_s^3 - k_1 a x_s^2 + k_4 x_s$$\nTo simplify this expression, we use equation $(2)$ to substitute for $k_4$. From $(2)$, $k_4 = 2k_1 a x_s - 3k_2 x_s^2$. Substituting this into the expression for $k_3 b$:\n$$k_3 b = k_2 x_s^3 - k_1 a x_s^2 + x_s(2k_1 a x_s - 3k_2 x_s^2)$$\n$$k_3 b = k_2 x_s^3 - k_1 a x_s^2 + 2k_1 a x_s^2 - 3k_2 x_s^3$$\n$$k_3 b = -2k_2 x_s^3 + k_1 a x_s^2 = x_s^2(k_1 a - 2k_2 x_s)$$\nSo, $b = \\frac{x_s^2}{k_3}(k_1 a - 2k_2 x_s)$.\n\nNow we substitute the two solutions $x_{s, \\pm}$ into this expression for $b$. Let $D = k_1^2 a^2 - 3k_2 k_4$.\nFor $x_{s, \\pm} = \\frac{k_1 a \\pm \\sqrt{D}}{3k_2}$, we compute the term $(k_1 a - 2k_2 x_s)$:\n$$k_1 a - 2k_2 x_{s,\\pm} = k_1 a - 2k_2 \\left(\\frac{k_1 a \\pm \\sqrt{D}}{3k_2}\\right) = k_1 a - \\frac{2}{3}(k_1 a \\pm \\sqrt{D}) = \\frac{1}{3}k_1 a \\mp \\frac{2}{3}\\sqrt{D}$$\nBy combining the expressions for $x_{s,\\pm}^2$ and $(k_1 a - 2k_2 x_{s,\\pm})$ and performing the algebraic expansion, we arrive at the two bifurcation values of $b$.

The dynamical system is:\n$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = \\left( k_a a_0 + k_2 x^2 y - k_b b_0 x - k_d x \\right) + D(x^{\\dagger} - x) $$\n$$ \\frac{dy}{dt} = \\left( k_b b_0 x - k_2 x^2 y \\right) + D(y^{\\dagger} - y) $$\nLet $F(x,y) = \\frac{dx}{dt}$ and $G(x,y) = \\frac{dy}{dt}$. By construction, $(x^{\\dagger}, y^{\\dagger})$ is a steady state of this full system for any $D \\ge 0$, as the reaction terms are zero at this point and the flow terms are also zero.\nTo linearize the system, we compute the Jacobian matrix $J_{\\mathrm{chem}}$ at the steady state $(x^{\\dagger}, y^{\\dagger})$:\n$$ J_{\\mathrm{chem}} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix}_{x=x^{\\dagger}, y=y^{\\dagger}} $$\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = 2k_2 xy - k_b b_0 - k_d - D $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = k_2 x^2 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial x} = k_b b_0 - 2k_2 xy $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial y} = -k_2 x^2 - D $$\nWe evaluate these derivatives at $(x^{\\dagger}, y^{\\dagger})$, using the equilibrium relation $k_2 x^{\\dagger} y^{\\dagger} = k_b b_0$:\n$$ J_{11} = 2k_2 x^{\\dagger}y^{\\dagger} - k_b b_0 - k_d - D = 2k_b b_0 - k_b b_0 - k_d - D = k_b b_0 - k_d - D $$\n$$ J_{12} = k_2 (x^{\\dagger})^2 = k_2 \\left(\\frac{k_a a_0}{k_d}\\right)^2 $$\n$$ J_{21} = k_b b_0 - 2k_2 x^{\\dagger}y^{\\dagger} = k_b b_0 - 2k_b b_0 = -k_b b_0 $$\n$$ J_{22} = -k_2 (x^{\\dagger})^2 - D = -k_2 \\left(\\frac{k_a a_0}{k_d}\\right)^2 - D $$\nThus, the Jacobian matrix of the full chemostat system is:\n$$ J_{\\mathrm{chem}} = \\begin{pmatrix} k_b b_0 - k_d - D  k_2 \\left(\\frac{k_a a_0}{k_d}\\right)^2 \\\\ -k_b b_0  -k_2 \\left(\\frac{k_a a_0}{k_d}\\right)^2 - D \\end{pmatrix} $$\nThis completes Part 2.\n\nFor Part 3, we analyze the eigenvalues of $J_{\\mathrm{chem}}$ to find the critical dilution rate $D_{\\mathrm{crit}}$. The structure of $J_{\\mathrm{chem}}$ can be written as $J_{\\mathrm{chem}} = J_0 - D \\cdot I$, where $I$ is the $2 \\times 2$ identity matrix and $J_0$ is the Jacobian of the reaction-only system (i.e., at $D=0$):\n$$ J_0 = \\begin{pmatrix} k_b b_0 - k_d  k_2 \\left(\\frac{k_a a_0}{k_d}\\right)^2 \\\\ -k_b b_0  -k_2 \\left(\\frac{k_a a_0}{k_d}\\right)^2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\nIf $\\mu$ is an eigenvalue of $J_0$ with eigenvector $v$, then $J_{\\mathrm{chem}}v = (J_0 - DI)v = J_0v - Dv = \\mu v - Dv = (\\mu - D)v$. Therefore, the eigenvalues $\\lambda$ of $J_{\\mathrm{chem}}$ are related to the eigenvalues $\\mu$ of $J_0$ by $\\lambda = \\mu - D$.\n\nThe eigenvalues $\\mu$ of $J_0$ are the roots of its characteristic polynomial $\\det(J_0 - \\mu I)=0$, which is $\\mu^2 - \\operatorname{Tr}(J_0)\\mu + \\det(J_0) = 0$. The solutions are:\n$$ \\mu = \\frac{\\operatorname{Tr}(J_0) \\pm \\sqrt{\\operatorname{Tr}(J_0)^2 - 4\\det(J_0)}}{2} $$\nThe problem states to assume that the eigenvalues of the linearization at $D=0$ are real. This means the eigenvalues of $J_0$, $\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$, are real, which implies the discriminant is non-negative: $\\operatorname{Tr}(J_0)^2 - 4\\det(J_0) \\ge 0$.\n\nThe eigenvalues of $J_{\\mathrm{chem}}$ are $\\lambda_1 = \\mu_1 - D$ and $\\lambda_2 = \\mu_2 - D$. Since $\\mu_1, \\mu_2$ are real, $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2$ are also real. The eigenvalue with the largest real part is $\\lambda_{\\max} = \\mu_{\\max} - D$, where $\\mu_{\\max}$ is the larger of the two eigenvalues of $J_0$:\n$$ \\mu_{\\max} = \\frac{\\operatorname{Tr}(J_0) + \\sqrt{\\operatorname{Tr}(J_0)^2 - 4\\det(J_0)}}{2} $$\nThe critical dilution rate $D_{\\mathrm{crit}}$ is defined as the value of $D$ at which the stability boundary is crossed, i.e., $\\operatorname{Re}\\lambda_{\\max}(J_{\\mathrm{chem}}) = 0$. Since the eigenvalues are real, this is simply $\\lambda_{\\max} = 0$:\n$$ \\mu_{\\max} - D_{\\mathrm{crit}} = 0 \\implies D_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\mu_{\\max} $$\nThe condition that for all $D  D_{\\mathrm{crit}}$, $\\operatorname{Re}\\lambda_{\\max}(J_{\\mathrm{chem}})  0$ is also satisfied: $\\mu_{\\max} - D  0 \\implies D  \\mu_{\\max} = D_{\\mathrm{crit}}$.\n\nTo find the final expression, we must compute $\\operatorname{Tr}(J_0)$ and $\\det(J_0)$:\n$$ \\operatorname{Tr}(J_0) = (k_b b_0 - k_d) + \\left(-k_2 \\left(\\frac{k_a a_0}{k_d}\\right)^2\\right) = k_b b_0 - k_d - k_2 \\frac{k_a^2 a_0^2}{k_d^2} $$\n$$ \\det(J_0) = (k_b b_0 - k_d)\\left(-k_2 \\left(\\frac{k_a a_0}{k_d}\\right)^2\\right) - \\left(k_2 \\left(\\frac{k_a a_0}{k_d}\\right)^2\\right)(-k_b b_0) $$\n$$ \\det(J_0) = -k_b b_0 k_2 \\frac{k_a^2 a_0^2}{k_d^2} + k_d k_2 \\frac{k_a^2 a_0^2}{k_d^2} + k_b b_0 k_2 \\frac{k_a^2 a_0^2}{k_d^2} = k_d k_2 \\frac{k_a^2 a_0^2}{k_d^2} = \\frac{k_2 k_a^2 a_0^2}{k_d} $$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $D_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\mu_{\\max}$:\n$$ D_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\left( k_b b_0 - k_d - k_2 \\frac{k_a^2 a_0^2}{k_d^2} \\right) + \\sqrt{\\left( k_b b_0 - k_d - k_2 \\frac{k_a^2 a_0^2}{k_d^2} \\right)^2 - 4 \\frac{k_2 k_a^2 a_0^2}{k_d}} \\right) $$\nThis is the final closed-form expression for the critical dilution rate.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}\\left( k_b b_0 - k_d - \\frac{k_2 k_a^2 a_0^2}{k_d^2} + \\sqrt{\\left( k_b b_0 - k_d - \\frac{k_2 k_a^2 a_0^2}{k_d^2} \\right)^2 - \\frac{4 k_2 k_a^2 a_0^2}{k_d}} \\right)}\n$$", "id": "2675565"}]}
