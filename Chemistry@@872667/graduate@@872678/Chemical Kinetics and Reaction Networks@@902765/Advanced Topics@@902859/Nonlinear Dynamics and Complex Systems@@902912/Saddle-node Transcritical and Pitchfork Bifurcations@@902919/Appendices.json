This exercise explores how symmetry constrains the mathematical form of a system's rate equations, which in turn determines the possible bifurcation scenarios [@problem_id:2197614]. Understanding this connection provides deep insight into why pitchfork bifurcations are synonymous with symmetry-breaking phenomena in physical and chemical systems.", "problem": "Consider a one-dimensional dynamical system described by the differential equation $\\dot{x} = f(x, r)$, where $x(t)$ is the state variable and $r$ is a real-valued control parameter. The system is known to possess an equilibrium point at $x=0$ for all values of $r$. Furthermore, the function $f(x, r)$ exhibits odd symmetry with respect to $x$, a property defined by the relation $f(-x, r) = -f(x, r)$ for all $x$ and $r$.\n\nAs the parameter $r$ is varied through the critical value $r=0$, the equilibrium point at $x=0$ is observed to undergo a local bifurcation.

Supercritical pitchfork bifurcation\n\nB. Saddle-node bifurcation\n\nC. Subcritical pitchfork bifurcation\n\nD. All of the above bifurcations are possible.", "solution": "We are given a one-dimensional system $\\dot{x}=f(x,r)$ with an equilibrium at $x=0$ for all $r$ and odd symmetry $f(-x,r)=-f(x,r)$ for all $x$ and $r$. We analyze which local bifurcations of the equilibrium at $x=0$ can occur at $r=0$ under the symmetry constraint.\n\nStep 1: Taylor expansion under odd symmetry.\nBecause $f$ is $C^{k}$ (assumed smooth) and odd in $x$, its Taylor expansion in $x$ about $x=0$ for $r$ near $0$ contains only odd powers of $x$:\n$$\nf(x,r)=a_{1}(r)\\,x+a_{3}(r)\\,x^{3}+a_{5}(r)\\,x^{5}+\\cdots,\n$$\nwhere each $a_{2j+1}(r)$ is smooth in $r$. In particular, there are no constant terms in $x$ and no even powers of $x$.\n\nStep 2: Condition for a local bifurcation at $x=0$.\nA local bifurcation of the equilibrium at $x=0$ as $r$ passes through $0$ requires that the linearization at the equilibrium have a zero eigenvalue at $r=0$, i.e.,\n$$\nf_{x}(0,0)=a_{1}(0)=0,\n$$\nand generically that $a_{1}'(0)\\neq 0$ so that the eigenvalue crosses through zero as $r$ varies. On the one-dimensional center manifold (which is the $x$-axis here), the reduced normal form to lowest nontrivial order is\n$$\n\\dot{x}=a_{1}(r)\\,x+a_{3}(0)\\,x^{3}.\n$$\nLet $\\mu=a_{1}(r)$ with $\\mu\\approx a_{1}'(0)\\,r$ and let $b=a_{3}(0)$. Then the local normal form becomes\n$$\n\\dot{x}=\\mu x+b x^{3}.\n$$\nThis is the standard pitchfork normal form. If $b0$, the pitchfork is supercritical; if $b0$, the pitchfork is subcritical. Both are compatible with the odd symmetry because the right-hand side is an odd function of $x$ for all $\\mu$.\n\nStep 3: Impossibility of a saddle-node at $x=0$ under odd symmetry.\nA saddle-node bifurcation at the equilibrium $x=0$ has the canonical local normal form\n$$\n\\dot{x}=\\mu\\pm x^{2},\n$$\nafter smooth changes of variables and parameters. This right-hand side is not an odd function of $x$ (it includes a constant-in-$x$ term $\\mu$ and an even power $x^{2}$). Therefore, it cannot satisfy the odd symmetry $f(-x,r)=-f(x,r)$ for any nonzero $\\mu$ and hence is incompatible with the imposed odd symmetry at all $r$. More generally, the Taylor series enforced by odd symmetry excludes both constant and even-power terms in $x$, so a saddle-node bifurcation at $x=0$ is impossible.\n\nConclusion: Supercritical and subcritical pitchfork bifurcations are possible; a saddle-node bifurcation at $x=0$ is impossible under the odd symmetry.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2197614"}, {"introduction": "We now apply our understanding of bifurcations to a canonical model in chemical kinetics known for exhibiting bistability: the Schlögl model.

Let $x$ denote the concentration of the dynamic species $X$. The law of mass action dictates the rate of change of $x$. The net rate of production of $X$ is the sum of the rates of the reactions producing $X$ minus the sum of the rates of the reactions consuming $X$.\n\nFrom reaction $1$, the production rate of $X$ is $k_1 [A] [X]^2 = k_1 A x^2$.

At the bifurcation point, the system's state $x_c$ corresponds to a non-hyperbolic equilibrium. This requires that the value of the function defining the dynamics is zero, and its derivative with respect to the state variable is also zero.\nThe two conditions for a saddle-node bifurcation are:\n1. $p(x_c) = 0$\n2. $p'(x_c) = \\frac{d}{dx} p(x) \\Big|_{x=x_c} = 0$\n\nCalculating the derivative of $p(x)$:\n$$\np'(x) = -3k_2 x^2 + 2k_1 A x - k_4\n$$\nThe simultaneous satisfaction of $p(x_c) = 0$ and $p'(x_c) = 0$ means that the polynomial $p(x)$ has a repeated root at $x_c$. The algebraic condition for a polynomial to have one or more repeated roots is that its discriminant must be zero.
