Let us fix $V_{\\mathrm{a}}$, $V_{\\mathrm{d}}$, and $S_{\\mathrmT}$ to some positive values, for example, $V_{\\mathrm{a}}=1$, $V_{\\mathrm{d}}=1$, and $S_{\\mathrmT}=1$. Let us set $K_{\\mathrm{a}}=K_{\\mathrm{d}}=K$ and examine the limit as $K \\to \\infty$.\nFirst, we find the steady state $y^{\\ast}$ under these conditions. The steady-state condition $f(y^{\\ast})=0$ implies $f_{\\mathrm{a}}(y^{\\ast}) = f_{\\mathrm{d}}(y^{\\ast})$:\n$$\n1 \\cdot \\frac{1 \\cdot (1-y^{\\ast})}{K + 1 \\cdot (1-y^{\\ast})} = 1 \\cdot \\frac{1 \\cdot y^{\\ast}}{K + y^{\\ast}}\n$$\n$$\n(1-y^{\\ast})(K+y^{\\ast}) = y^{\\ast}(K+1-y^{\\ast})\n$$\n$$\nK + y^{\\ast} - Ky^{\\ast} - (y^{\\ast})^2 = Ky^{\\ast} + y^{\\ast} - (y^{\\ast})^2\n$$\n$$\nK = 2Ky^{\\ast}\n$$\nSince $K \\in \\mathbb{R}_{0}$, we can divide by $2K$ to obtain $y^{\\ast} = \\frac{1}{2}$. This steady-state value is independent of $K$.\nNow, we substitute these parameters and $y^{\\ast}=\\frac{1}{2}$ into the expression for the Jacobian:\n$$\nJ = - \\left( \\frac{1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot K}{(K + 1 \\cdot (1-1/2))^2} + \\frac{1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot K}{(K + 1/2)^2} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nJ = - \\left( \\frac{K}{(K + 1/2)^2} + \\frac{K}{(K + 1/2)^2} \\right) = - \\frac{2K}{(K + 1/2)^2}\n$$\nWe now take the limit of this expression as $K \\to \\infty$:\n$$\n\\lim_{K\\to\\infty} J = \\lim_{K\\to\\infty} - \\frac{2K}{K^2 + K + 1/4}\n$$\nTo evaluate this limit, we divide the numerator and the denominator by the highest power of $K$ in the denominator, which is $K^2$:\n$$\n\\lim_{K\\to\\infty} J = \\lim_{K\\to\\infty} - \\frac{2/K}{1 + 1/K + 1/(4K^2)} = \\frac{0}{1 + 0 + 0} = 0\n$$\nWe have shown that $J  0$ for all parameters in $\\mathcal{P}$, and we have constructed a sequence of parameters within $\\mathcal{P}$ for which $J$ approaches $0$. By the definition of the supremum as the least upper bound, it must be that the supremum of $J$ over the set $\\mathcal{P}$ is $0$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$", "id": "2694570"}]}
