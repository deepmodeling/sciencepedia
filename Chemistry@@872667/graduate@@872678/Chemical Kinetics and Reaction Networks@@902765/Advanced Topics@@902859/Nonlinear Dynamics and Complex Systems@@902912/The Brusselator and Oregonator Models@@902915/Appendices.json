The problem is self-contained and provides all necessary information for its resolution. It does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a full solution can be constructed.\n\nThe solution is divided into three parts, corresponding to the three tasks mandated by the problem.\n\nFirst, we justify the given ordinary differential equations (ODEs) from the reaction network using the law of mass action. The reaction network is given by:\n$1$. $A \\to X$\n$2$. $2X + Y \\to 3X$\n$3$. $B + X \\to Y + D$\n$4$. $X \\to E$\nLet $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ represent the concentrations of chemical species $X$ and $Y$, respectively. Let the constant concentrations of the chemostatted species $A$ and $B$ be denoted by $[A]$ and $[B]$. The species $D$ and $E$ are products and do not influence the kinetics of $X$ and $Y$. Let the rate constants for reactions $1$ through $4$ be $k_1$, $k_2$, $k_3$, and $k_4$. According to the law of mass action, the rates of these reactions are:\n$v_1 = k_1 [A]$\n$v_2 = k_2 x^2 y$\n$v_3 = k_3 [B] x$\n$v_4 = k_4 x$\n\nThe rate of change of the concentration of species $X$, $\\dot{x}$, is the sum of the rates of its production and consumption.\n- Reaction $1$: $X$ is produced, contribution is $+v_1 = +k_1 [A]$.\n- Reaction $2$: Net change in $X$ is $3X - 2X = +1X$, so $X$ is produced. Contribution is $+v_2 = +k_2 x^2 y$.\n- Reaction $3$: $X$ is consumed. Contribution is $-v_3 = -k_3 [B] x$.\n- Reaction $4$: $X$ is consumed. Contribution is $-v_4 = -k_4 x$.\nCombining these terms gives the ODE for $x(t)$:\n$$ \\dot{x} = \\frac{dx}{dt} = k_1[A] + k_2 x^2 y - k_3[B]x - k_4 x $$\nSimilarly, for the concentration of species $Y$, $\\dot{y}$:\n- Reaction $2$: $Y$ is consumed. Contribution is $-v_2 = -k_2 x^2 y$.\n- Reaction $3$: $Y$ is produced. Contribution is $+v_3 = +k_3 [B] x$.\nThe ODE for $y(t)$ is:\n$$ \\dot{y} = \\frac{dy}{dt} = k_3[B]x - k_2 x^2 y $$\nThe problem states that an appropriate nondimensionalization has been performed, setting the relevant rate constants to unity. This implies that a scaling of variables and time has been chosen such that $k_1 = k_2 = k_3 = k_4 = 1$. Furthermore, the dimensionless parameters $A$ and $B$ in the final equations correspond to the initial, constant concentrations $[A]$ and $[B]$. Under these specified conditions, the system of ODEs becomes:\n$$ \\dot{x} = A + x^2 y - Bx - x = A - (B+1)x + x^2 y $$\n$$ \\dot{y} = Bx - x^2 y $$\nThis derivation justifies the form of the ODEs provided in the problem statement.\n\nSecond, we derive the Jacobian matrix $J(x,y)$ for the vector field $(f(x,y), g(x,y))$. The components of the vector field are given as:\n$f(x,y) = A - (B+1)x + x^2 y$\n$g(x,y) = Bx - x^2 y$\nThe Jacobian matrix $J(x,y)$ is defined as:\n$$ J(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\\\ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x}  \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} \\end{pmatrix} $$\nWe compute the four partial derivatives:\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (A - (B+1)x + x^2 y) = -(B+1) + 2xy$\n$\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} (A - (B+1)x + x^2 y) = x^2$\n$\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} (Bx - x^2 y) = B - 2xy$\n$\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y} (Bx - x^2 y) = -x^2$\nSubstituting these into the matrix gives the Jacobian:\n$$ J(x,y) = \\begin{pmatrix} 2xy - B - 1  x^2 \\\\ B - 2xy  -x^2 \\end{pmatrix} $$\n\nThird, we determine the unique steady state $(x^*, y^*)$ and evaluate the determinant of the Jacobian at this point, $\\det J(x^*, y^*)$.\nThe steady state is found by setting the time derivatives to zero:\n$\\dot{x} = f(x^*, y^*) = A - (B+1)x^* + (x^*)^2 y^* = 0$\n$\\dot{y} = g(x^*, y^*) = Bx^* - (x^*)^2 y^* = 0$\nFrom the second equation, assuming $x^* \\neq 0$ (a trivial state $x^*=0$ would imply $A=0$ from the first equation, which is not a chemically interesting case for feed species), we find:\n$(x^*)^2 y^* = Bx^*$\nSubstituting this expression into the first equation:\n$A - (B+1)x^* + Bx^* = 0$\n$A - Bx^* - x^* + Bx^* = 0$\n$A - x^* = 0 \\implies x^* = A$\nNow, we use this result to find $y^*$.

For the concentrations to be physically meaningful, we must have $A > 0$ and $B \\ge 0$.\n\nFinally, we evaluate the Jacobian matrix at this steady state.
