The overall reaction is A(g) $\\rightleftharpoons$ B(g). Through in-situ spectroscopic studies, they propose a mechanism involving two distinct types of active sites on the catalyst surface, leading to two different adsorbed intermediates, I and J.\n\nTheir proposed mechanism is as follows:\n- The forward reaction (A $\\to$ B) primarily occurs via intermediate I:\n    $$A(g) + S_1 \\rightleftharpoons I(ads)$$\n    $$I(ads) \\rightleftharpoons B(g) + S_1$$\n    where $S_1$ is a vacant active site of the first type.\n\n- The reverse reaction (B $\\to$ A) is claimed to proceed predominantly through a different intermediate, J, on a second type of active site:\n    $$B(g) + S_2 \\rightleftharpoons J(ads)$$\n    $$J(ads) \\rightleftharpoons A(g) + S_2$$\n    where $S_2$ is a vacant active site of the second type.\n\nEvaluate the physical validity of this proposed dual-pathway mechanism at chemical equilibrium.\n\nA. The mechanism is valid. The principle of microscopic reversibility only applies to individual elementary reactions, not to overall reaction pathways which can be different for the forward and reverse directions.\n\nB. The mechanism is invalid. It violates the principle of detailed balance, which dictates that at equilibrium, the forward rate of every elementary process must be equal to its reverse rate, necessitating that the forward and reverse transformations between any two species occur via the same pathway.\n\nC. The mechanism is valid. As long as the catalyst provides a path that lowers the activation energy, it is possible for different types of active sites to specialize in catalyzing the forward and reverse reactions independently.\n\nD. The mechanism is invalid because the presence of two different intermediates (I and J) for the same overall reaction would create an unstable thermodynamic loop, which is forbidden.\n\nE. The validity cannot be determined without the specific values of the rate constants for each elementary step. If the rate constants are appropriate, the mechanism could be valid.", "solution": "We label the two catalytic channels and write mass-action rates for each elementary step.

For S1/I,\n$$\n\\frac{k_{1a}^{+} k_{1b}^{+}}{k_{1a}^{-} k_{1b}^{-}} = \\frac{p_{B}}{p_{A}} \\equiv K_{\\text{eq}},\n$$\nand for S2/J,\n$$\n\\frac{k_{2a}^{+} k_{2b}^{+}}{k_{2a}^{-} k_{2b}^{-}} = \\frac{p_{B}}{p_{A}} = K_{\\text{eq}}.\n$$\nThus both channels, if present, must individually reflect the same thermodynamic equilibrium constant; a catalyst cannot change $K_{\\text{eq}}$.\n\nDefine the net fluxes through each channel under steady conditions:\n$$\nJ_{1} \\equiv r_{1a,f} - r_{1a,r} = r_{1b,f} - r_{1b,r}, \\quad\nJ_{2} \\equiv r_{2a,f} - r_{2a,r} = r_{2b,f} - r_{2b,r}.\n$$\nThe overall reaction rate is $J = J_{1} + J_{2}$. At chemical equilibrium, $J = 0$. Detailed balance strengthens this to $J_{1} = 0$ and $J_{2} = 0$ individually, because each elementary step must obey zero net flux:\n$$\nr_{i,f} = r_{i,r} \\implies J_{1} = 0, \\quad J_{2} = 0.\n$$\nTherefore, it is forbidden at equilibrium to have a nonzero net forward flux on one pathway and a nonzero net reverse flux on a different pathway that merely cancel in total (i.e., $J_{1}  0$ and $J_{2}  0$ with $J_{1} + J_{2} = 0$). Such a configuration would violate detailed balance by implying $r_{i,f} \\neq r_{i,r}$ for at least some elementary steps and would generate a nonzero cyclic probability current, which is incompatible with equilibrium.\n\nConsequently:\n- The existence of two reversible pathways with different intermediates and site types is not inherently forbidden; both pathways can coexist provided each elementary step is reversible and obeys detailed balance at equilibrium.\n- However, the specific claim that the forward reaction proceeds primarily via one pathway (I on S1) while the reverse reaction proceeds predominantly via a different pathway (J on S2) at equilibrium contradicts detailed balance, because at equilibrium there can be no preferential net direction along any elementary step or pathway.\n\nOption B correctly identifies this violation and invokes the principle of detailed balance. Options A and C incorrectly suggest that different exclusive forward and reverse pathways are permissible at equilibrium. Option D misattributes the issue to an inherently unstable loop caused by multiple intermediates, which is not generally correct. Option E is incorrect because the validity at equilibrium is constrained by detailed balance independently of the specific numerical values of rate constants; if the mechanism were as claimed (exclusive opposing pathways), no choice of rate constants could satisfy detailed balance at equilibrium.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1505506"}, {"introduction": "A cornerstone of physical chemistry is the consistency between thermodynamic and kinetic descriptions of a system at equilibrium.
