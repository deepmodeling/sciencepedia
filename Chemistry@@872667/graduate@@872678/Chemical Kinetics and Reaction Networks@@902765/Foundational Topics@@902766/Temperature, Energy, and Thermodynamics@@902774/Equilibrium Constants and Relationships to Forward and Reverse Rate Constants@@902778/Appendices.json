It is a standard exercise in chemical kinetics that tests fundamental principles. We will proceed with a solution.\n\nThe problem specifies an elementary reversible association reaction in a dilute ideal solution under isothermal conditions:\n$$\nA + B \\rightleftharpoons AB\n$$\nThe forward step, $A + B \\rightarrow AB$, is a bimolecular process with rate constant $k_{f}$. The reverse step, $AB \\rightarrow A + B$, is a unimolecular process with rate constant $k_{r}$.\n\nAccording to the law of mass action for elementary reactions, the rate of the forward reaction, $v_{f}$, is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the reactants:\n$$\nv_{f} = k_{f} [A] [B]\n$$\nThe rate of the reverse reaction, $v_{r}$, is proportional to the concentration of the reactant for that step:\n$$\nv_{r} = k_{r} [AB]\n$$\nHere, $[A]$, $[B]$, and $[AB]$ represent the molar concentrations of the respective species.\n\nThe problem requires us to use the definition of chemical equilibrium as the state of vanishing net production rate. The net rate of reaction, specifically the net rate of formation of the product $AB$, is the difference between the forward and reverse rates:\n$$\nv_{\\text{net}} = \\frac{d[AB]}{dt} = v_{f} - v_{r} = k_{f} [A] [B] - k_{r} [AB]\n$$\nAt chemical equilibrium, the net rate of reaction is zero, which means the concentrations of all species are constant in time. This condition implies that the rate of the forward reaction must be equal to the rate of the reverse reaction:\n$$\nv_{f} = v_{r}\n$$\nLet us denote the concentrations at equilibrium as $[A]_{\\text{eq}}$, $[B]_{\\text{eq}}$, and $[AB]_{\\text{eq}}$. Substituting the rate expressions into the equilibrium condition gives:\n$$\nk_{f} [A]_{\\text{eq}} [B]_{\\text{eq}} = k_{r} [AB]_{\\text{eq}}\n$$\nThe concentration-based equilibrium constant, $K_{c}$, is defined by the ratio of the equilibrium concentrations of products to reactants, with each concentration raised to the power of its stoichiometric coefficient. For the given reaction, this is:\n$$\nK_{c} = \\frac{[AB]_{\\text{eq}}}{[A]_{\\text{eq}} [B]_{\\text{eq}}}\n$$\nBy rearranging the equation derived from the equality of rates at equilibrium, we can express this ratio in terms of the rate constants:\n$$\n\\frac{[AB]_{\\text{eq}}}{[A]_{\\text{eq}} [B]_{\\text{eq}}} = \\frac{k_{f}}{k_{r}}\n$$\nThus, we have derived the fundamental relationship between the equilibrium constant and the kinetic rate constants for this elementary reaction:\n$$\nK_{c} = \\frac{k_{f}}{k_{r}}\n$$\nWe are given the numerical values for the rate constants: $k_{f} = 3.184 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $k_{r} = 0.812\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.

The values $3.184$ (four significant figures) and $0.812$ (three significant figures) limit the precision of the result. Therefore:\n$$\nK_{c} \\approx 3.92 \\times 10^{7}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\n$$\nNow, we address the question of units. The units of $K_{c}$ are a direct consequence of its definition, both from the concentrations and from the rate constants. From the rate constants:\n$$\n\\text{units of } K_{c} = \\frac{\\text{units of } k_{f}}{\\text{units of } k_{r}} = \\frac{\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{\\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\n$$\nThis is consistent with its definition in terms of concentrations:\n$$\n\\text{units of } K_{c} = \\frac{\\text{units of } [AB]}{\\text{units of } [A] \\cdot \\text{units of } [B]} = \\frac{\\mathrm{M}}{\\mathrm{M} \\cdot \\mathrm{M}} = \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\n$$\nIn general, $K_{c}$ has units of $(\\text{concentration})^{\\Delta n}$, where $\\Delta n$ is the change in the sum of stoichiometric coefficients from reactants to products. For $A + B \\rightleftharpoons AB$, $\\Delta n = 1 - (1+1) = -1$.\n\nFinally, we must explain how a dimensionless thermodynamic equilibrium constant, which we shall denote $K_{\\text{eq}}$, is obtained. In formal thermodynamics, the equilibrium constant is defined in terms of activities, not concentrations. For a solute $i$ in a dilute ideal solution, its activity $a_{i}$ is defined as a dimensionless quantity:\n$$\na_{i} = \\frac{[i]}{C^{\\circ}}\n$$\nwhere $C^{\\circ}$ is the standard state concentration, specified here as $C^{\\circ} = 1\\ \\mathrm{M}$. The thermodynamic equilibrium constant is then:\n$$\nK_{\\text{eq}} = \\frac{a_{AB}}{a_{A} a_{B}} = \\frac{[AB]_{\\text{eq}}/C^{\\circ}}{([A]_{\\text{eq}}/C^{\\circ})([B]_{\\text{eq}}/C^{\\circ})}\n$$\nSimplifying this expression reveals its relationship to $K_{c}$:\n$$\nK_{\\text{eq}} = \\frac{[AB]_{\\text{eq}}}{[A]_{\\text{eq}}[B]_{\\text{eq}}} \\cdot \\frac{(C^{\\circ})^2}{C^{\\circ}} = K_{c} \\cdot C^{\\circ}\n$$\nBy this construction, $K_{\\text{eq}}$ is made dimensionless.

The law of mass action for elementary reactions dictates that the rate is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the reactants raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients. For the forward reaction, $2A \\to A_{2}$, the rate is given by:\n$$v_f = k_f [A]^2$$\nFor the reverse reaction, $A_{2} \\to 2A$, the rate is:\n$$v_r = k_r [A_2]$$\nAt chemical equilibrium, the net rate of reaction is zero, which means the rate of the forward reaction is equal to the rate of the reverse reaction:\n$$v_f = v_r$$\n$$k_f [A]^2 = k_r [A_2]$$\nThis equality allows us to express the ratio of the rate constants in terms of the equilibrium concentrations:\n$$\\frac{k_f}{k_r} = \\frac{[A_2]}{[A]^2}$$\nThe right-hand side of this equation is the concentration-based equilibrium quotient, often denoted $K_{eq,c}$.\n\nNow, we must connect this kinetic result to the thermodynamic definition of the equilibrium constant. The dimensionless equilibrium constant, $K_c$, is defined in terms of the activities of the species at equilibrium. For the given reaction, this is:\n$$K_c = \\frac{a_{A_2}}{(a_A)^2}$$\nwhere $a_i$ is the activity of species $i$. The problem states that activities are given by ideal forms with a standard state of $c^{\\circ} = 1\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ L^{-1}}$. Thus, for any species $i$, its activity $a_i$ is related to its molar concentration $[i]$ by:\n$$a_i = \\frac{[i]}{c^{\\circ}}$$\nSubstituting this definition into the expression for $K_c$:\n$$K_c = \\frac{[A_2]/c^{\\circ}}{([A]/c^{\\circ})^2} = \\frac{[A_2]}{[A]^2} \\cdot c^{\\circ}$$\nBy comparing this thermodynamic definition with the result from kinetic equivalence at equilibrium, we establish the required relationship:\n$$K_c = \\left( \\frac{k_f}{k_r} \\right) c^{\\circ}$$\nThis derivation explicitly shows the role of the standard state concentration $c^{\\circ}$ in rendering the thermodynamic equilibrium constant $K_c$ dimensionless.\n\n**Part 2: Relationship between Concentration-Based and Pressure-Based Equilibrium Constants**\n\nNext, we derive the relationship between the dimensionless concentration-based constant $K_c$ and the dimensionless pressure-based constant $K_p$. The constant $K_p$ is defined analogously to $K_c$, but using activities based on partial pressures, with a standard state of $p^{\\circ} = 1\\ \\mathrm{bar}$:\n$$K_p = \\frac{a'_{A_2}}{(a'_A)^2}$$\nwhere the activity $a'_i$ is given by $a'_i = P_i / p^{\\circ}$, with $P_i$ being the partial pressure of species $i$.\n$$K_p = \\frac{P_{A_2}/p^{\\circ}}{(P_A/p^{\\circ})^2} = \\frac{P_{A_2}}{P_A^2} \\cdot p^{\\circ}$$\nThe problem assumes ideal-gas behavior, for which the partial pressure $P_i$ of a component is related to its molar concentration $[i]$ by the ideal gas law:\n$$P_i = [i]RT$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $K_p$:\n$$K_p = \\frac{([A_2]RT)}{([A]RT)^2} \\cdot p^{\\circ} = \\frac{[A_2]}{[A]^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{RT} \\cdot p^{\\circ}$$\nFrom Part 1, we know that the ratio of concentrations $\\frac{[A_2]}{[A]^2}$ can be expressed in terms of $K_c$ as $\\frac{K_c}{c^{\\circ}}$. Substituting this gives:\n$$K_p = \\left( \\frac{K_c}{c^{\\circ}} \\right) \\frac{p^{\\circ}}{RT} = K_c \\left( \\frac{p^{\\circ}}{c^{\\circ}RT} \\right)$$\nThis relationship can be generalized. For a reaction with a change in the number of moles of gas $\\Delta n_g$, the relationship is $K_p = K_c \\left(\\frac{c^{\\circ}RT}{p^{\\circ}}\\right)^{\\Delta n_g}$.
