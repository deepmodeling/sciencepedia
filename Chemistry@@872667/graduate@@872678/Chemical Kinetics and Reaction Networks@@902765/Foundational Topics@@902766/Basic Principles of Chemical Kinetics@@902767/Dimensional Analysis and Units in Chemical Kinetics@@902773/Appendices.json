It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and requires the application of fundamental principles. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe cornerstone of this analysis is the principle of dimensional homogeneity, which states that any physically meaningful equation must have identical dimensions for all terms that are equated. The given empirical rate law is:\n$$\nr = k C^{n}\n$$\nAccording to the principle of dimensional homogeneity, the dimensions of the left side of the equation must equal the dimensions of the right side. We denote the dimensions of a physical quantity $Q$ as $[Q]$. Therefore, we must have:\n$$\n[r] = [k C^{n}] = [k] [C]^{n}\n$$\nHere, $n$ is the order of reaction, which is a dimensionless pure number. The operation of raising a dimensional quantity to a dimensionless power is a valid mathematical operation.\n\nFirst, we must establish the dimensions of the quantities involved based on the problem statement. The base dimensions are stated to be amount of substance ($N$), length ($L$), and time ($T$).\n\nThe amount concentration, $C$, is defined as amount of substance per unit volume. The dimension of volume is length cubed, $L^{3}$. Thus, the dimensions of concentration are:\n$$\n[C] = \\frac{N}{L^{3}} = N L^{-3}\n$$\nThe reaction rate, $r$, is defined as the change of concentration per unit time. Therefore, its dimensions are the dimensions of concentration divided by the dimension of time:\n$$\n[r] = \\frac{[C]}{T} = \\frac{N L^{-3}}{T} = N L^{-3} T^{-1}\n$$\n\n**Part 1: Argument for Negative Reaction Orders**\n\nThe question asks for a principled argument on why a negative reaction order, $n < 0$, does not violate dimensional homogeneity. From the dimensional equation derived from the rate law, we can isolate the dimensions of the rate constant, $k$:\n$$\n[k] = \\frac{[r]}{[C]^{n}}\n$$\nSubstituting the dimensions for $[r]$ and $[C]$:\n$$\n[k] = \\frac{N L^{-3} T^{-1}}{(N L^{-3})^{n}}\n$$\nUsing the rules of exponents, we can simplify this expression:\n$$\n[k] = (N L^{-3} T^{-1}) (N^{-n} (L^{-3})^{-n}) = (N L^{-3} T^{-1}) (N^{-n} L^{3n})\n$$\nCombining terms with the same base dimensions:\n$$\n[k] = N^{1-n} L^{-3+3n} T^{-1} = N^{1-n} L^{3(n-1)} T^{-1}\n$$\nThis equation provides the dimensions for the rate constant $k$ for any given reaction order $n$. The crucial point is that this relationship holds for any real number $n$. Dimensional homogeneity is not a principle that restricts the value of the exponent $n$; rather, it is a constraint that *defines* the dimensions of the proportionality constant $k$ needed to make the equation valid for a given $n$.\n\nIf $n$ is negative, let $n = -m$ where $m > 0$. The dimensions of $k$ become:\n$$\n[k] = N^{1-(-m)} L^{3(-m-1)} T^{-1} = N^{1+m} L^{-3(m+1)} T^{-1}\n$$\nThis is a perfectly valid set of dimensions. For any choice of $n < 0$, we can compute a unique and well-defined set of exponents for the base dimensions $N$, $L$, and $T$ that constitute the dimensions of $k$. The physical interpretation of a negative order, often related to inhibition or saturation phenomena in complex reaction mechanisms, is a separate matter from the dimensional consistency of the empirical rate law. The rate law $r = k C^{n}$ with $n < 0$ remains dimensionally homogeneous precisely because the dimensions of the rate constant $k$ are adapted to ensure it.\n\n**Part 2: Dimensions of $k$ for $n = -1$**\n\nFor the specific case where the reaction order is $n = -1$, the rate law is:\n$$\nr = k C^{-1}\n$$\nTo find the dimensions of the rate constant $k$, we again apply the principle of dimensional homogeneity:\n$$\n[k] = \\frac{[r]}{[C]^{-1}} = [r][C]\n$$\nNow, we substitute the known dimensions of rate and concentration:\n$$\n[r] = N L^{-3} T^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n[C] = N L^{-3}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $[k]$:\n$$\n[k] = (N L^{-3} T^{-1})(N L^{-3})\n$$\nWe combine the exponents for each base dimension:\n$$\n[k] = N^{1+1} L^{-3 + (-3)} T^{-1} = N^{2} L^{-6} T^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed as the exponent row matrix $\\begin{pmatrix} a & b & c \\end{pmatrix}$ such that $[k] = N^{a} L^{b} T^{c}$.

Taking the natural logarithm of the Arrhenius equation gives:\n$$\n\\ln k = \\ln A - \\frac{E_a}{R} \\left(\\frac{1}{T}\\right)\n$$\nThis is a linear equation of the form $y = c + m x$, with $y = \\ln k$ and $x = 1/T$.

The units are consistent: $[\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}] \\cdot [\\mathrm{K}] = [\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}]$, as required.\n\nThe researcher, however, mistakenly plots $\\ln k$ versus $1/t$, where $t$ is the temperature in degrees Celsius ($\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C}$). The mistaken two-point slope is:\n$$\nm_{\\text{mistaken}} = \\frac{\\ln k_2 - \\ln k_1}{1/t_2 - 1/t_1}\n$$\nThe units of this mistaken slope are $[m_{\\text{mistaken}}] = [1 / (1/\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C})] = [\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C}]$. The researcher then calculates a reported \"activation energy,\" which we denote as $E_{a, \\text{reported}}$, by multiplying this slope by $-R$:\n$$\nE_{a, \\text{reported}} = -R \\cdot m_{\\text{mistaken}}\n$$\nThe units of this reported quantity are $[R] \\cdot [m_{\\text{mistaken}}] = [\\mathrm{J}\\,\\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}] \\cdot [\\,^\\circ\\mathrm{C}]$. This expression is dimensionally inconsistent. It is not a unit of energy, demonstrating the fundamental flaw in the researcher's procedure. The use of the Celsius scale, which is an interval scale and not a ratio scale, is invalid in a multiplicative physical relation like the Arrhenius law.\n\nTo derive a corrected expression for the true activation energy $E_a$, we relate the mistaken slope to the true energy. We start with the expression for the difference in the logarithm of the rate constants:\n$$\n\\ln k_2 - \\ln k_1 = -\\frac{E_a}{R} \\left( \\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1} \\right)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the definition of the mistaken slope:\n$$\nm_{\\text{mistaken}} = \\frac{-\\frac{E_a}{R} \\left( \\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1} \\right)}{\\frac{1}{t_2} - \\frac{1}{t_1}} = -\\frac{E_a}{R} \\frac{\\frac{T_1 - T_2}{T_1 T_2}}{\\frac{t_1 - t_2}{t_1 t_2}}\n$$\nWe use the relation $T = t + 273.15$. It follows that a difference in temperature is the same in both scales: $T_1 - T_2 = (t_1 + 273.15) - (t_2 + 273.15) = t_1 - t_2$. The expression for the slope simplifies to:\n$$\nm_{\\text{mistaken}} = -\\frac{E_a}{R} \\frac{t_1 t_2}{T_1 T_2}\n$$\nThe researcher's reported energy is $E_{a, \\text{reported}} = -R \\cdot m_{\\text{mistaken}}$. Substituting the expression for $m_{\\text{mistaken}}$:\n$$\nE_{a, \\text{reported}} = -R \\left( -\\frac{E_a}{R} \\frac{t_1 t_2}{T_1 T_2} \\right) = E_a \\frac{t_1 t_2}{T_1 T_2}\n$$\nTo recover the physically correct activation energy $E_a$ from the mistaken slope, we rearrange this equation. The reported energy is based on the mistaken slope, $E_{a, \\text{reported}} = -R \\cdot m_{\\text{mistaken}}$. The corrected expression for $E_a$ is therefore:\n$$\nE_a = E_{a, \\text{reported}} \\cdot \\frac{T_1 T_2}{t_1 t_2} = (-R \\cdot m_{\\text{mistaken}}) \\frac{T_1 T_2}{t_1 t_2}\n$$\nThis is the required corrected expression.\n\nSecond, we compute the numerical ratio of the naively reported activation energy to the true activation energy for the specified temperatures. The ratio is $\\frac{E_{a, \\text{reported}}}{E_a}$.
