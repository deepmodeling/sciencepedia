Derivation using the Pre-Equilibrium Approximation (PEA)\nThe pre-equilibrium approximation posits that the first reversible step achieves a state of quasi-equilibrium very rapidly compared to the rate of the subsequent product formation step. This implies that the forward and reverse rates of the first step are nearly equal:\n$$\nk_{1}[A][B] \\approx k_{-1}[I]\n$$\nSolving for the concentration of the intermediate $[I]$ yields the PEA expression:\n$$\n[I]^{\\mathrm{(PEA)}} = \\frac{k_{1}}{k_{-1}}[A][B]\n$$\nThe problem requests the initial intermediate concentration at $t=0^{+}$. At this moment, the concentrations of reactants $A$ and $B$ are effectively unchanged from their initial values, $[A]_{0}$ and $[B]_{0}$. Therefore, we obtain:\n$$\n[I]_{0}^{\\mathrm{(PEA)}} = \\frac{k_{1}}{k_{-1}}[A]_{0}[B]_{0}\n$$\n\n2. Derivation using the Steady-State Approximation (SSA)\nThe steady-state approximation assumes that the concentration of the reactive intermediate, $I$, is small and its rate of change is negligible compared to its rates of formation and consumption. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\n\\frac{d[I]}{dt} \\approx 0\n$$\nApplying this condition to the ODE for $[I]$:\n$$\nk_{1}[A][B] - (k_{-1} + k_{2})[I] \\approx 0\n$$\nSolving for $[I]$ gives the SSA expression:\n$$\n[I]^{\\mathrm{(SSA)}} = \\frac{k_{1}[A][B]}{k_{-1} + k_{2}}\n$$\nEvaluating this at $t=0^{+}$ using the initial reactant concentrations, we find:\n$$\n[I]_{0}^{\\mathrm{(SSA)}} = \\frac{k_{1}}{k_{-1} + k_{2}}[A]_{0}[B]_{0}\n$$\n\n3. Assessment of Approximations and Justification\nTo ascertain which approximation is more suitable, we must test the validity conditions for each against the provided numerical data.\nThe condition for the validity of the PEA is that the reverse reaction of the first step ($I \\to A+B$) must be much faster than the second step ($I \\to P$). This translates to a comparison of their respective rate constants:\n$$\nk_{2} \\ll k_{-1}\n$$\nThe condition for the validity of the SSA is that the characteristic relaxation time of the intermediate, $\\tau_{I}$, must be much shorter than the characteristic time for reactant depletion, $\\tau_{A}$. The relaxation time for $I$ is $\\tau_{I} = (k_{-1} + k_{2})^{-1}$. The initial characteristic time for depletion of $A$ is $\\tau_{A} \\approx ([A]_{0})/(k_{1}[A]_{0}[B]_{0}) = 1/(k_{1}[B]_{0})$. Thus, the SSA is valid if $\\tau_{I} \\ll \\tau_{A}$, which means $(k_{-1} + k_{2})^{-1} \\ll (k_{1}[A]_{0})^{-1}$, or:\n$$\nk_{1}[A]_{0} \\ll k_{-1} + k_{2}\n$$\nLet us examine these conditions with the given values: $k_{1}=10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{M^{-1}s^{-1}}$, $k_{-1}=10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, $k_{2}=10^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, and $[A]_{0}=[B]_{0}=10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{M}$.\n\nFor PEA: $k_{2} \\ll k_{-1}$?\nWe have $10^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} \\ll 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$. This inequality is strongly satisfied, as $k_{-1}$ is three orders of magnitude larger than $k_{2}$.\n\nFor SSA: $k_{1}[A]_{0} \\ll k_{-1} + k_{2}$?\nThe left side is $k_{1}[A]_{0} = (10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{M^{-1}s^{-1}})(10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{M}) = 10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\nThe right side is $k_{-1} + k_{2} = 10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} + 10^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} = 100100\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$.\nThe inequality is $10^{3}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} \\ll 100100\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}$, which is also strongly satisfied.\n\nBoth approximations are mathematically valid. However, the PEA is a more specific condition than the SSA. The SSA expression for $[I]$ simplifies to the PEA expression in the limit where $k_{2} \\ll k_{-1}$, since $k_{-1} + k_{2} \\approx k_{-1}$. Because this limit is so clearly met in this problem, the system's behavior is more accurately and physically described as a rapid pre-equilibrium. Therefore, the pre-equilibrium approximation is the more appropriate choice.\n\nWe now compute the numerical values for the intermediate concentrations.\nBased on the PEA:\n$$\n[I]_{0}^{\\mathrm{(PEA)}} = \\frac{10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{M^{-1}s^{-1}}}{10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}} (10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{M})^{2} = 10 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{M} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{M}\n$$\nBased on the SSA:\n$$\n[I]_{0}^{\\mathrm{(SSA)}} = \\frac{10^{6}\\,\\mathrm{M^{-1}s^{-1}}}{10^{5}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}} + 10^{2}\\,\\mathrm{s^{-1}}} (10^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{M})^{2} = \\frac{10^{6}}{100100} \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{M} \\approx 9.990 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{M}\n$$\nAs established, the PEA is the more appropriate approximation because its validity condition is strongly met, making it the most accurate physical description of the system's state.

It is free of subjective claims or non-scientific content.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. A solution will now be derived.\n\nThe overall rate of the reaction, $r_{P}$, is determined by the rate of the slowest elementary step, which is specified as the surface reaction. This is the rate-determining step (RDS):\n$$A*_{s} + B*_{s} \\rightarrow P_{(g)} + 2*_{s}$$\nAccording to the law of mass action applied to surface species, the rate of this step, and thus the rate of formation of $P$, is proportional to the product of the surface coverages of the reactants $A*_{s}$ and $B*_{s}$. Let $r_{P}$ be the rate expressed per total number of sites. Then:\n$$r_{P} = k \\theta_{A} \\theta_{B}$$\nHere, $\\theta_{A}$ and $\\theta_{B}$ are the fractional surface coverages of adsorbed $A$ and $B$, and $k$ is the rate constant for the surface reaction.\n\nThe problem requires the final expression to be in terms of gas-phase partial pressures $p_{A}$ and $p_{B}$. Therefore, the surface coverages $\\theta_{A}$ and $\\theta_{B}$ must be expressed in terms of these pressures. This is achieved by using the quasi-equilibrium assumption for the preceding adsorption steps.\n\nFor the first adsorption step, $A_{(g)} + *_{s} \\rightleftharpoons A*_{s}$, the equilibrium constant $K_{A}$ is defined in terms of activities ($a_{i}$):\n$$K_{A} = \\frac{a_{A*_{s}}}{a_{A_{(g)}} a_{*_{s}}}$$\nUnder the given assumptions of an ideal gas phase and an ideal adsorbed layer (no lateral interactions, single-site occupancy), the activities can be expressed as follows:\n- For the gas-phase species $A$: $a_{A_{(g)}} = p_{A} / P^{\\circ}$, where $P^{\\circ}$ is the standard pressure.\n- For the surface species: $a_{A*_{s}} = \\theta_{A}$ and $a_{*_{s}} = \\theta_{*}$.\nThus, the equilibrium relationship is:\n$$K_{A} = \\frac{\\theta_{A}}{(p_{A}/P^{\\circ}) \\theta_{*}}$$\nIt is standard practice in catalysis to define a new adsorption constant that incorporates the standard pressure, having units of inverse pressure. We follow this convention and use the symbol $K_{A}$ for this composite constant, such that:\n$$K_{A} = \\frac{\\theta_{A}}{p_{A} \\theta_{*}}$$\nRearranging this equation gives an expression for $\\theta_{A}$:\n$$\\theta_{A} = K_{A} p_{A} \\theta_{*}$$\n\nA completely analogous treatment is applied to the second adsorption step, $B_{(g)} + *_{s} \\rightleftharpoons B*_{s}$:\n$$K_{B} = \\frac{\\theta_{B}}{p_{B} \\theta_{*}}$$\nThis yields an expression for $\\theta_{B}$:\n$$\\theta_{B} = K_{B} p_{B} \\theta_{*}$$\n\nThe expressions for $\\theta_{A}$ and $\\theta_{B}$ depend on the coverage of vacant sites, $\\theta_{*}$. To eliminate $\\theta_{*}$, we use the site balance equation provided:\n$$\\theta_{*} + \\theta_{A} + \\theta_{B} = 1$$\nSubstitute the expressions for $\\theta_{A}$ and $\\theta_{B}$ into the site balance:\n$$\\theta_{*} + (K_{A} p_{A} \\theta_{*}) + (K_{B} p_{B} \\theta_{*}) = 1$$\nFactor out $\\theta_{*}$ from the left-hand side:\n$$\\theta_{*} (1 + K_{A} p_{A} + K_{B} p_{B}) = 1$$\nSolving for $\\theta_{*}$ gives:\n$$\\theta_{*} = \\frac{1}{1 + K_{A} p_{A} + K_{B} p_{B}}$$\nThis denominator is the characteristic adsorption term in Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics.\n\nNow, we can write $\\theta_{A}$ and $\\theta_{B}$ solely in terms of measurable gas-phase pressures and constants by substituting the expression for $\\theta_{*}$ back into their respective definitions:\n$$\\theta_{A} = K_{A} p_{A} \\theta_{*} = \\frac{K_{A} p_{A}}{1 + K_{A} p_{A} + K_{B} p_{B}}$$\n$$\\theta_{B} = K_{B} p_{B} \\theta_{*} = \\frac{K_{B} p_{B}}{1 + K_{A} p_{A} + K_{B} p_{B}}$$\n\nFinally, substitute these expressions for $\\theta_{A}$ and $\\theta_{B}$ into the rate equation for $r_{P}$:\n$$r_{P} = k \\theta_{A} \\theta_{B} = k \\left( \\frac{K_{A} p_{A}}{1 + K_{A} p_{A} + K_{B} p_{B}} \\right) \\left( \\frac{K_{B} p_{B}}{1 + K_{A} p_{A} + K_{B} p_{B}} \\right)$$\nSimplifying this expression yields the final Langmuir-Hinshelwood rate law:\n$$r_{P} = \\frac{k K_{A} K_{B} p_{A} p_{B}}{(1 + K_{A} p_{A} + K_{B} p_{B})^{2}}$$\nThis expression for the rate of formation of $P$ contains only the specified parameters: $k, K_{A}, K_{B}, p_{A}$, and $p_{B}$.
