A full analysis of each option is warranted.\n\nThe general form of the rate law for this reaction is $r = - \\frac{d[A]}{dt} = k[A]^n$, where $n$ is the reaction order and $k$ is the rate constant. We will analyze the consequences of this law for $n=0$, $n=1$, and $n=2$.\n\n**Zero-Order Kinetics ($n=0$)**\n- Rate Law: $-\\frac{d[A]}{dt} = k$\n- Integrated Rate Law: $[A] = [A]_0 - kt$. A plot of $[A]$ versus $t$ is linear with a slope of $-k$.\n- Half-Life: $t_{1/2} = \\frac{[A]_0}{2k}$.

A plot of $\\ln[A]$ versus $t$ is linear with a slope of $-k$.\n- Half-Life: $t_{1/2} = \\frac{\\ln(2)}{k}$.

A plot of $\\frac{1}{[A]}$ versus $t$ is linear with a slope of $k$.\n- Half-Life: $t_{1/2} = \\frac{1}{k[A]_0}$. Half-life is inversely proportional to the initial concentration.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option based on these first principles.\n\n**Option A Analysis**\nThis option describes the \"integral method\" for determining reaction order. It proposes plotting $[A]$ vs. $t$ (for zero-order), $\\ln[A]$ vs. $t$ (for first-order), and $1/[A]$ vs. $t$ (for second-order). This is the standard set of linearizing transformations derived from the integrated rate laws. The option then elevates the method beyond simple visual inspection by requiring analysis of residuals for structureless and homoscedastic behavior, which is a key principle of proper statistical model validation. Furthermore, it introduces two powerful, independent checks:\n1.  Verifying the invariance of the calculated rate constant $k$ with respect to the initial concentration $[A]_0$. The true rate constant must be independent of $[A]_0$.\n2.  Verifying that the scaling of the half-life $t_{1/2}$ with $[A]_0$ matches the prediction for the diagnosed order.\nThis represents a comprehensive and scientifically rigorous methodology.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Option B Analysis**\nThis option proposes a set of graphical tests:\n1.  $\\ln(1/[A])$ versus $t$ for first-order. Since $\\ln(1/[A]) = -\\ln[A]$, this is equivalent to plotting $-\\ln[A]$ vs. $t$. From the first-order integrated rate law, $-\\ln[A] = -\\ln[A]_0 + kt$. This plot would indeed be linear. This test is valid, although presented in a slightly non-standard form.\n2.  $1/[A]^2$ versus $t$ for second-order. The correct linear plot for second-order kinetics is $1/[A]$ versus $t$. A plot of $1/[A]^2$ versus $t$ would be a plot of $(\\frac{1}{[A]_0} + kt)^2$ versus $t$, which is a quadratic function of $t$, not a linear one. This test is incorrect.\n3.  $1/\\ln [A]$ versus $t$ for zero-order. The correct linear plot for zero-order kinetics is $[A]$ versus $t$. A plot of $1/\\ln([A]_0 - kt)$ versus $t$ has no theoretical basis for linearity. This test is incorrect.\nSince two of the three proposed tests are fundamentally flawed, the overall strategy is invalid.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**Option C Analysis**\nThis option describes the \"differential method\". The rate law is $r = k[A]^n$. Taking the natural logarithm of this equation yields $\\ln(r) = \\ln(k) + n\\ln[A]$. This is an equation for a straight line, $y = m x + c$, where $y = \\ln(r)$, the slope $m = n$ (the reaction order), $x = \\ln[A]$, and the intercept $c = \\ln(k)$. The procedure involves numerically estimating the rate $r = -d[A]/dt$ from the experimental $[A](t)$ data and then plotting $\\ln(r)$ against $\\ln[A]$. The slope of the resulting line directly yields the reaction order $n$. The use of smoothing is essential for managing noise in numerical differentiation. The criteria of a constant slope and structureless residuals are proper statistical checks for the validity of the fit and the underlying rate law model. This is a standard and powerful method for determining reaction order without prior assumption of an integer value.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Option D Analysis**\nThis option describes the \"method of half-lives\". It correctly states the distinct scaling relationships between half-life $t_{1/2}$ and initial concentration $[A]_0$ for different orders:\n- $0$-order: $t_{1/2} \\propto [A]_0$, so a plot of $t_{1/2}$ vs. $[A]_0$ is linear.\n- $1$-order: $t_{1/2}$ is independent of $[A]_0$.\n- $2$-order: $t_{1/2} \\propto 1/[A]_0$, so a plot of $t_{1/2}$ vs. $1/[A]_0$ is linear.\nThe method requires performing multiple experiments at different initial concentrations to establish this scaling relationship. The requirement that the linear plots have small intercepts is also correct, as the theoretical relationships predict passage through the origin ($t_{1/2}=0$ if $[A]_0=0$ for $0$-order; $t_{1/2} \\to 0$ as $1/[A]_0 \\to 0$ for $2$-order). This is a valid and classic kinetic analysis technique.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**Option E Analysis**\nThis option proposes an unconventional plot of $t/[A]$ versus $t$. We must analyze its behavior for each order.\n- For second-order kinetics, $\\frac{1}{[A]} = \\frac{1}{[A]_0} + kt$. Multiplying by $t$ gives $\\frac{t}{[A]} = \\frac{t}{[A]_0} + kt^2$. This is a quadratic function of $t$, not linear. The claim is false.\n- For first-order kinetics, $[A] = [A]_0 e^{-kt}$. The function is $y(t) = \\frac{t}{[A]} = \\frac{t}{[A]_0}e^{kt}$. Its second derivative is $y''(t) = \\frac{k e^{kt}}{[A]_0} (2+kt)$. For $t \\ge 0$ and $k > 0$, $y''(t) > 0$, so the plot is concave upward. The claim is correct.\n- For zero-order kinetics, $[A] = [A]_0 - kt$. The function is $y(t) = \\frac{t}{[A]} = \\frac{t}{[A]_0 - kt}$. Its second derivative is $y''(t) = \\frac{2k[A]_0}{([A]_0 - kt)^3}$. For the reaction to proceed, $[A]_0 - kt > 0$, so $y''(t) > 0$. The plot is concave upward. The claim that it is concave downward is false.\nThe diagnostic scheme is flawed for both zero-order and second-order cases.

Using the identity $\\frac{\\partial \\ln f}{\\partial \\ln x} = \\frac{x}{f}\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}$, we have:\n$$\ns_{1} = \\frac{k_{1}}{v} \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial k_{1}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad s_{2} = \\frac{k_{2}}{v} \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial k_{2}}\n$$\nWe calculate the partial derivative of $v$ with respect to $k_{1}$ using the quotient rule:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial k_{1}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k_{1}} \\left( \\frac{k_{1}k_{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}]}{k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2}} \\right) = \\frac{(k_{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}])(k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2}) - (k_{1}k_{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}])([\\mathrm{A}])}{(k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2})^{2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial k_{1}} = \\frac{k_{1}k_{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}]^{2} + k_{2}^{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}] - k_{1}k_{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}]^{2}}{(k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2})^{2}} = \\frac{k_{2}^{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}]}{(k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2})^{2}}\n$$\nNow we construct $s_{1}$:\n$$\ns_{1} = \\frac{k_{1}}{v} \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial k_{1}} = \\frac{k_{1}}{\\frac{k_{1}k_{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}]}{k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2}}} \\left( \\frac{k_{2}^{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}]}{(k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2})^{2}} \\right) = \\frac{k_{1}(k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2})}{k_{1}k_{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}]} \\frac{k_{2}^{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}]}{(k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2})^{2}}\n$$\nAfter cancellation of common terms, we find the simple expression:\n$$\ns_{1} = \\frac{k_{2}}{k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2}}\n$$\nSimilarly for $s_{2}$, we compute the partial derivative of $v$ with respect to $k_{2}$:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial k_{2}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial k_{2}} \\left( \\frac{k_{1}k_{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}]}{k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2}} \\right) = \\frac{(k_{1}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}])(k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2}) - (k_{1}k_{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}])(1)}{(k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2})^{2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial k_{2}} = \\frac{k_{1}^{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}]^{2} + k_{1}k_{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}] - k_{1}k_{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}]}{(k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2})^{2}} = \\frac{k_{1}^{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}]^{2}}{(k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2})^{2}}\n$$\nNow we construct $s_{2}$:\n$$\ns_{2} = \\frac{k_{2}}{v} \\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial k_{2}} = \\frac{k_{2}}{\\frac{k_{1}k_{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}]}{k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2}}} \\left( \\frac{k_{1}^{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}]^{2}}{(k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2})^{2}} \\right) = \\frac{k_{2}(k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2})}{k_{1}k_{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}]} \\frac{k_{1}^{2}[\\mathrm{E}]_{T}[\\mathrm{A}]^{2}}{(k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2})^{2}}\n$$\nAfter cancellation, this simplifies to:\n$$\ns_{2} = \\frac{k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}]}{k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2}}\n$$\nNote that $s_{1} + s_{2} = \\frac{k_{2}}{k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2}} + \\frac{k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}]}{k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2}} = 1$, which is a required summation property for sensitivities in this system as the rate $v$ is a homogeneous function of degree $1$ in $(k_1, k_2)$.\n\nFor the third and fourth tasks, we evaluate these sensitivities using the given parameters and interpret the result.\nThe parameters are: $k_{1} = 2.4 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $k_{2} = 3.2\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, and $[\\mathrm{A}] = 9.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{M}$. First, we compute the term $k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}]$, which represents the pseudo-first-order rate constant for the binding step:\n$$\nk_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] = (2.4 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (9.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{M}) = 2.16\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nNow we can compute the numerical values for $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$:\n$$\ns_{1} = \\frac{k_{2}}{k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2}} = \\frac{3.2\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{2.16\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} + 3.2\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{3.2}{5.36} \\approx 0.5970149...\n$$\n$$\ns_{2} = \\frac{k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}]}{k_{1}[\\mathrm{A}] + k_{2}} = \\frac{2.16\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{2.16\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1} + 3.2\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}} = \\frac{2.16}{5.36} \\approx 0.402985...\n$$\nThe interpretation for task 3 is as follows. The concept of a single rate-determining step (RDS) implies that one step's sensitivity coefficient would be close to 1 while others would be near 0. Here, the effective pseudo-first-order rate constants for the two steps are $k_1[\\mathrm{A}] = 2.16\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $k_2 = 3.2\\ \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. These values are comparable. The calculated sensitivities, $s_1 \\approx 0.5970$ and $s_2 \\approx 0.4030$, reflect this. Since neither coefficient is close to 1 while the other is close to 0, both steps exert significant control over the overall rate. This demonstrates the limitations of the single RDS approximation; control is distributed between the steps when their effective barriers are of a similar magnitude. Step 1 has slightly more control ($s_1 > s_2$), which is consistent with its effective rate constant being smaller.\n\nThe final task is to report the value of $s_{1}$ rounded to four significant figures.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.5970}\n$$", "id": "2668743"}]}
