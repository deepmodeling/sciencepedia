The problem statement is objective, precise, and free of contradictions, ambiguities, or factual errors. It adheres to all criteria for a valid scientific problem.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is validated as sound. A complete solution will now be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Rate Laws and Diagnostic Ratio**\n\nAccording to the law of mass action, the rate of change of the concentration of the reactive intermediate, $[I]$, is given by the balance of its formation and consumption rates:\n$$\n\\frac{d[I]}{dt} = k_{1}[A][B] - k_{-1}[I] - k_{2}[I]\n$$\nThe rate of product formation, which we denote as $v$, is:\n$$\nv = \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_{2}[I]\n$$\nThe objective is to find expressions for $v$ under each approximation by eliminating the concentration of the intermediate, $[I]$.\n\n**1. Quasi-Steady-State Approximation (QSSA)**\nThe QSSA asserts that the concentration of the highly reactive intermediate $I$ is approximately constant on the relevant timescale, which implies $\\frac{d[I]}{dt} \\approx 0$. Applying this to the rate equation for $I$:\n$$\nk_{1}[A][B] - k_{-1}[I]_{\\mathrm{QSSA}} - k_{2}[I]_{\\mathrm{QSSA}} \\approx 0\n$$\nSolving for the steady-state concentration, $[I]_{\\mathrm{QSSA}}$:\n$$\nk_{1}[A][B] \\approx (k_{-1} + k_{2})[I]_{\\mathrm{QSSA}}\n$$\n$$\n[I]_{\\mathrm{QSSA}} \\approx \\frac{k_{1}[A][B]}{k_{-1} + k_{2}}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the product formation rate yields the QSSA rate law, $v_{\\mathrm{QSSA}}$:\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{QSSA}} = k_{2}[I]_{\\mathrm{QSSA}} = \\frac{k_{1}k_{2}}{k_{-1} + k_{2}}[A][B]\n$$\n\n**2. Pre-Equilibrium Approximation (PEA)**\nThe PEA assumes that the first reversible step achieves equilibrium much more rapidly than the second step consumes the intermediate. This means the reversible reaction $A + B \\rightleftharpoons I$ is in a state of quasi-equilibrium, where the forward and reverse rates are balanced:\n$$\nk_{1}[A][B] \\approx k_{-1}[I]_{\\mathrm{PEA}}\n$$\nSolving for the intermediate concentration under this approximation, $[I]_{\\mathrm{PEA}}$:\n$$\n[I]_{\\mathrm{PEA}} \\approx \\frac{k_{1}}{k_{-1}}[A][B]\n$$\nThe underlying condition for the validity of the PEA is that the rate of consumption of $I$ to form product $P$ is negligible compared to the rate of its reversion to reactants $A$ and $B$, i.e., $k_{2}[I] \\ll k_{-1}[I]$, which simplifies to the condition on the rate constants: $k_{2} \\ll k_{-1}$.\nSubstituting $[I]_{\\mathrm{PEA}}$ into the product formation rate expression gives the PEA rate law, $v_{\\mathrm{PEA}}$:\n$$\nv_{\\mathrm{PEA}} = k_{2}[I]_{\\mathrm{PEA}} = \\frac{k_{1}k_{2}}{k_{-1}}[A][B]\n$$\n\n**3. Diagnostic Ratio $\\Xi$ and Condition for Equivalence**\nThe diagnostic ratio $\\Xi$ is defined as $\\frac{v_{\\mathrm{QSSA}}}{v_{\\mathrm{PEA}}}$. Using the derived rate laws:\n$$\n\\Xi = \\frac{\\frac{k_{1}k_{2}}{k_{-1} + k_{2}}[A][B]}{\\frac{k_{1}k_{2}}{k_{-1}}[A][B]}\n$$\nAssuming a non-trivial reaction system where $k_{1}$, $k_{2}$, $[A]$, and $[B]$ are non-zero, we cancel common terms:\n$$\n\\Xi = \\frac{k_{-1}}{k_{-1} + k_{2}}\n$$\nThis is the required closed-form expression for $\\Xi$.\n\nTo find the condition for which the two rate laws are identical in the exact mathematical sense, we set $v_{\\mathrm{QSSA}} = v_{\\mathrm{PEA}}$:\n$$\n\\frac{k_{1}k_{2}}{k_{-1} + k_{2}}[A][B] = \\frac{k_{1}k_{2}}{k_{-1}}[A][B]\n$$\nCanceling the common factor $k_{1}k_{2}[A][B]$ (for a non-trivial case) yields:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{k_{-1} + k_{2}} = \\frac{1}{k_{-1}}\n$$\nThis equality holds only if $k_{-1} = k_{-1} + k_{2}$, which requires $k_{2} = 0$. This is a degenerate case where no product is formed, and both rates are trivially zero.\nFrom a physical standpoint, the QSSA reduces to the PEA in the limit where the PEA is valid, which is $k_{2} \\ll k_{-1}$. In this limit, $k_{-1} + k_{2} \\approx k_{-1}$, and thus $v_{\\mathrm{QSSA}} \\approx v_{\\mathrm{PEA}}$. Consequently, $\\Xi$ approaches $1$. The strict mathematical identity, however, is only satisfied for the trivial condition $k_{2}=0$.\n\nThe final answer requires only the analytic expression for $\\Xi$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{k_{-1}}{k_{-1} + k_{2}}}\n$$", "id": "2693540"}, {"introduction": "Moving from abstract theory to quantitative analysis, this practice demonstrates how to use experimental parameters to make a data-driven choice between the QSSA and PEA.
