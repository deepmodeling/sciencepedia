The system is assumed to be well-mixed, isothermal, and at constant volume, allowing the use of concentrations directly in the rate laws derived from the law of mass action.\n\nFirst, we derive the system of ordinary differential equations that describes the time evolution of the concentrations of all species: $[A]$, $[B]$, $[C]$, and $[P]$.\n\nThe rate of change of $[A]$ is determined by its consumption in the forward reaction $A + B \\rightarrow C$ and its production in the reverse reaction $C \\rightarrow A + B$. Applying the law of mass action:\n$$\\frac{d[A]}{dt} = -k_{1}[A][B] + k_{-1}[C]$$\nBy stoichiometry, the rate of change of $[B]$ is identical to that of $[A]$:\n$$\\frac{d[B]}{dt} = -k_{1}[A][B] + k_{-1}[C]$$\nThe intermediate species $C$ is produced by the forward reaction $A + B \\rightarrow C$ and consumed by both the reverse reaction $C \\rightarrow A + B$ and the product formation step $C \\rightarrow P$. Therefore, its rate of change is:\n$$\\frac{d[C]}{dt} = k_{1}[A][B] - k_{-1}[C] - k_{2}[C] = k_{1}[A][B] - (k_{-1} + k_{2})[C]$$\nFinally, the product $P$ is formed exclusively from the irreversible conversion of $C$. Its rate of formation is:\n$$\\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_{2}[C]$$\nThis completes the first part of the problem.\n\nNext, we derive the rate of product formation, $v \\equiv \\frac{d[P]}{dt}$, under the steady-state approximation (SSA) for the intermediate $C$. The SSA posits that the concentration of the reactive intermediate $C$ is very low and its rate of change is negligible compared to the rates of change of reactants and products. Mathematically, this is expressed as $\\frac{d[C]}{dt} \\approx 0$.\nApplying this approximation to the differential equation for $[C]$:\n$$\\frac{d[C]}{dt} = k_{1}[A][B] - (k_{-1} + k_{2})[C] \\approx 0$$\nWe can now solve for the steady-state concentration of the intermediate, $[C]_{\\mathrm{SSA}}$:\n$$(k_{-1} + k_{2})[C]_{\\mathrm{SSA}} = k_{1}[A][B]$$\n$$[C]_{\\mathrm{SSA}} = \\frac{k_{1}[A][B]}{k_{-1} + k_{2}}$$\nThe rate of product formation under the SSA, $v_{\\mathrm{SSA}}$, is then found by substituting this expression for $[C]$ into the rate law for $P$:\n$$v_{\\mathrm{SSA}} = \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_{2}[C]_{\\mathrm{SSA}} = k_{2} \\left( \\frac{k_{1}[A][B]}{k_{-1} + k_{2}} \\right)$$\n$$v_{\\mathrm{SSA}} = \\frac{k_{1}k_{2}}{k_{-1} + k_{2}}[A][B]$$\n\nNow, we derive the rate of product formation under the pre-equilibrium (PE) assumption. The PE assumption is valid when the first reversible step $A+B \\xrightleftharpoons C$ is much faster than the second step $C \\rightarrow P$ (i.e., $k_{2}$ is the rate-limiting step constant, implying $k_{-1} \\gg k_{2}$). Under this condition, the first step is assumed to be in a state of rapid equilibrium. At equilibrium, the rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction:\n$$k_{1}[A][B] = k_{-1}[C]$$\nFrom this equality, we solve for the equilibrium concentration of the intermediate, $[C]_{\\mathrm{PE}}$:\n$$[C]_{\\mathrm{PE}} = \\frac{k_{1}}{k_{-1}}[A][B]$$\nThe overall rate of reaction is still governed by the slow, rate-determining step, which is the formation of $P$ from $C$.

One power of $k_{2}$ in the numerator cancels with the $k_{2}$ in the denominator. This leaves:\n$$\\delta = \\frac{k_{2}}{k_{-1} + k_{2}}$$\nThis is the final, simplest exact closed form for the relative deviation $\\delta$ in terms of only the microscopic rate constants, as required. The result correctly shows that the deviation $\\delta$ approaches $0$ as $k_{2} \\ll k_{-1}$, which is precisely the condition under which the pre-equilibrium assumption is valid, meaning $v_{\\mathrm{SSA}}$ converges to $v_{\\mathrm{PE}}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{k_{2}}{k_{-1} + k_{2}}}\n$$", "id": "2667507"}, {"introduction": "Applying the steady-state approximation can reveal non-intuitive yet crucial insights into the behavior of reaction networks.

It presents a standard problem in chemical kinetics that can be solved using established principles. We will now proceed with a complete solution.\n\nThe overarching principle is the law of mass action, which states that the rate of an elementary reaction is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the reactants. The core assumption is the Steady-State Approximation (SSA) for the intermediate species $I$, which posits that the net rate of change of its concentration is approximately zero, $d[I]/dt \\approx 0$. This is valid when the intermediate is highly reactive and its concentration remains low and nearly constant during the reaction progress.\n\nPart 1: Irreversible Association Mechanism\n\nThe mechanism is given by two elementary steps:\n- Association: $A + B \\xrightarrow{k_{1}} I$\n- Conversion: $I \\xrightarrow{k_{2}} P$\n\nFirst, we write the differential rate equations for the concentrations of the intermediate, $[I]$, and the product, $[P]$, based on the law of mass action. The concentration of species $A$ and $B$, denoted $[A]$ and $[B]$, are assumed to be constant as per the problem statement.\n\nThe rate of change of the concentration of the intermediate $I$ is given by its rate of formation from $A$ and $B$ minus its rate of consumption to form $P$:\n$$\n\\frac{d[I]}{dt} = k_{1}[A][B] - k_{2}[I]\n$$\n\nThe rate of formation of the product $P$, denoted $r_P$, is given by the rate of the second step:\n$$\nr_{P} \\equiv \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_{2}[I]\n$$\n\nWe now apply the Steady-State Approximation to the intermediate $I$, setting $d[I]/dt = 0$:\n$$\n\\frac{d[I]}{dt} = k_{1}[A][B] - k_{2}[I] \\approx 0\n$$\nFrom this algebraic equation, we can solve for the steady-state concentration of the intermediate, $[I]_{ss}$:\n$$\nk_{1}[A][B] = k_{2}[I]_{ss}\n$$\n$$\n[I]_{ss} = \\frac{k_{1}}{k_{2}}[A][B]\n$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for the steady-state concentration of $I$ into the rate law for product formation:\n$$\nr_{P} = k_{2}[I]_{ss} = k_{2} \\left( \\frac{k_{1}}{k_{2}}[A][B] \\right)\n$$\nThe rate constant $k_2$ cancels out, yielding:\n$$\nr_{P} = k_{1}[A][B]\n$$\nThis expression is in the required form $r_{P} = k_{\\mathrm{eff}} [A][B]$, where the effective second-order rate constant is:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{eff}} = k_{1}\n$$\nThis result demonstrates that, under the SSA, the effective rate constant is simply the rate constant of the first step, $k_1$, and is independent of the rate constant of the second step, $k_2$.\n\nThe physical interpretation of this independence lies in the concept of flux balance imposed by the steady-state condition. The SSA, $k_{1}[A][B] = k_{2}[I]$, dictates that the rate of formation of the intermediate $I$ (the flux into the intermediate state, $J_{in} = k_{1}[A][B]$) must exactly equal the rate of its consumption (the flux out of the intermediate state, $J_{out} = k_{2}[I]$). The rate of product formation, $r_P$, is by definition equal to this outward flux, $J_{out}$. Therefore, at steady state, the rate of product formation must be equal to the rate of intermediate formation: $r_P = J_{out} = J_{in} = k_{1}[A][B]$. In this mechanism, the first step is the rate-determining step for the overall reaction. It acts as a bottleneck, supplying the intermediate at a fixed rate. The second step's rate constant, $k_2$, only influences the steady-state concentration of $I$ that is required to maintain this flux balance, but it does not affect the overall throughput of the system, which is governed entirely by the supply rate from the first step.\n\nPart 2: Reversible Association Mechanism\n\nThe modified mechanism includes a reverse reaction for the first step:\n- Reversible Association: $A + B \\xrightleftharpoons[k_{-1}]{k_{1}} I$\n- Conversion: $I \\xrightarrow{k_{2}} P$\n\nWe again write the rate equation for the intermediate $I$. The formation of $I$ occurs with rate $k_{1}[A][B]$. The consumption of $I$ now occurs through two pathways: the reverse reaction back to $A$ and $B$ (rate $k_{-1}[I]$) and the forward reaction to product $P$ (rate $k_{2}[I]$).\n$$\n\\frac{d[I]}{dt} = k_{1}[A][B] - k_{-1}[I] - k_{2}[I] = k_{1}[A][B] - (k_{-1} + k_{2})[I]\n$$\nThe rate of product formation remains unchanged:\n$$\nr_{P} = \\frac{d[P]}{dt} = k_{2}[I]\n$$\nApplying the SSA for $I$ ($d[I]/dt \\approx 0$):\n$$\nk_{1}[A][B] - (k_{-1} + k_{2})[I]_{ss} = 0\n$$\nSolving for the steady-state concentration $[I]_{ss}$:\n$$\n[I]_{ss} = \\frac{k_{1}[A][B]}{k_{-1} + k_{2}}\n$$\nSubstitute this expression into the rate law for product formation:\n$$\nr_{P} = k_{2}[I]_{ss} = k_{2} \\left( \\frac{k_{1}[A][B]}{k_{-1} + k_{2}} \\right)\n$$\nRearranging the terms gives the rate law in the desired form:\n$$\nr_{P} = \\left( \\frac{k_{1}k_{2}}{k_{-1} + k_{2}} \\right) [A][B]\n$$\nBy comparing this to the general form $r_{P} = k_{\\mathrm{eff}} [A][B]$, we identify the effective second-order rate constant as:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{k_{1}k_{2}}{k_{-1} + k_{2}}\n$$\nThis is the complete expression for the effective rate constant for the reversible mechanism.\n\nTo show how this general expression reduces to the result from the irreversible case, we consider the limit where the reverse association step is absent. This corresponds to setting the rate constant for the reverse reaction to zero, i.e., $k_{-1} \\rightarrow 0$. Substituting $k_{-1} = 0$ into our derived expression for $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$:\n$$\nk_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{k_{1}k_{2}}{0 + k_{2}} = \\frac{k_{1}k_{2}}{k_{2}} = k_{1}\n$$\nThis result, $k_{\\mathrm{eff}} = k_1$, is precisely the same as that obtained in Part 1 for the irreversible mechanism. This confirms the consistency of our derivations. In the reversible case, the rate is no longer simply determined by the first step because the intermediate can now revert to reactants. The overall rate depends on the competition between the reverse reaction ($k_{-1}$) and the product-forming step ($k_{2}$).", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{k_{1}k_{2}}{k_{-1} + k_{2}}}\n$$", "id": "2667564"}, {"introduction": "The true power of kinetic modeling lies in its ability to connect microscopic reaction steps to macroscopic, measurable quantities.
