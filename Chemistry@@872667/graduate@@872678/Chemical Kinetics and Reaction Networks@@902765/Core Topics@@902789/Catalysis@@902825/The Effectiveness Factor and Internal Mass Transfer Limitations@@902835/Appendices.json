It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem in chemical reaction engineering that admits a unique and meaningful solution. It is free of contradictions, ambiguities, and factual errors. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe fundamental principle is the local species balance for component $A$ at steady state within the porous catalyst. The general balance equation states that the rate of generation of species $A$ per unit volume must balance the divergence of its flux. Given a consumption reaction with rate $-r_{A}$, the generation rate is $r_{A}$. The balance is:\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\vec{N}_A + (-r_A) = 0 $$\nwhere $\\vec{N}_A$ is the molar flux of $A$. With mass transport occurring only by diffusion and no bulk flow, Fick's first law describes the flux:\n$$ \\vec{N}_A = -D_e \\nabla C_A $$\nThe reaction is first-order, so $-r_A = k C_A$. Substituting these expressions into the species balance, and assuming the effective diffusivity $D_e$ is constant, we obtain the governing second-order partial differential equation:\n$$ -D_e \\nabla^2 C_A + k C_A = 0 \\quad \\implies \\quad \\nabla^2 C_A - \\frac{k}{D_e} C_A = 0 $$\nWe will now solve this equation for each of the three specified geometries.

Therefore, we can compute $\\phi$ by solving the scalar root-finding problem\n$$\nf(\\phi) \\;=\\; \\eta(\\phi) \\;-\\; \\eta_{\\mathrm{meas}} \\;=\\; 0,\n$$\nwith a robust bracketing method. A suitable bracket is $\\phi\\in[0,\\Phi_{\\max}]$ for a sufficiently large $\\Phi_{\\max}$ because $f(0)=1-\\eta_{\\mathrm{meas}}\\ge 0$ and $f(\\Phi_{\\max}) \\approx -\\eta_{\\mathrm{meas}}0$ for large $\\Phi_{\\max}$. The small-$\\phi$ and large-$\\phi$ asymptotics can be used to generate good initial estimates and to improve numerical stability for extreme values, though a simple adaptive bracketing strategy is sufficient.\n\nOnce $\\phi$ has been determined, the pellet radius $R$ is recovered from the definition of the Thiele modulus:\n$$\nR \\;=\\; \\phi\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{D_e}{k}},\n$$\nwhich we then express in millimeters:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{mm}} \\;=\\; 1000\\,R \\;=\\; 1000\\,\\phi\\,\\sqrt{\\frac{D_e}{k}}.\n$$\n\nAlgorithmic design:\n- Implement a numerically stable function for $\\eta(\\phi)$ using the closed-form expression. For very small $\\phi$ (e.g., $\\phi \\ll 1$), use the small-$\\phi$ series to avoid numerical cancellation; for general $\\phi$, use $\\eta(\\phi)=\\frac{3}{\\phi^2}\\left(\\frac{\\phi}{\\tanh \\phi}-1\\right)$, noting that $\\coth\\phi = 1/\\tanh\\phi$.\n- Given $\\eta_{\\mathrm{meas}}$, if $\\eta_{\\mathrm{meas}} \\ge 1$ within a tolerance, set $\\phi=0$ and $R=0$. Otherwise, solve $f(\\phi)=0$ with a bracketing root-finder such as the Brent method on $[10^{-12},\\Phi_{\\max}]$ with an adaptive increase of $\\Phi_{\\max}$ until $f(\\Phi_{\\max})0$.\n- Compute $R_{\\mathrm{mm}}=1000\\,\\phi\\sqrt{D_e/k}$.\n- Round both $\\phi$ and $R_{\\mathrm{mm}}$ to $6$ significant figures.\n- Apply this procedure to the specified test suite with $(\\eta, k, D_e)$ equal to $(0.35,\\,1.2,\\,2.5\\times 10^{-9})$, $(0.95,\\,1.2,\\,2.5\\times 10^{-9})$, $(0.10,\\,1.2,\\,2.5\\times 10^{-9})$, $(0.60,\\,0.4,\\,8.0\\times 10^{-10})$, and $(1.0,\\,2.0,\\,1.0\\times 10^{-9})$.\n- Output a single line containing the comma-separated list of $[\\phi,R_{\\mathrm{mm}}]$ pairs enclosed in square brackets and with no spaces.\n\nThis approach is grounded in the steady-state diffusion–reaction balance, the first-order rate law, and the definitions of the Thiele modulus and effectiveness factor. The monotonicity of $\\eta(\\phi)$ ensures a unique solution to the inversion problem for $\\phi$, and the subsequent computation of $R$ follows directly from the definition of $\\phi$.", "answer": "[[7.30206,0.333157],[1.11116,0.0506798],[29.0034,1.32281],[2.87175,0.40612],[0,0]]", "id": "2648673"}]}
