We will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe first task is to derive the mean relative speed, $\\langle v \\rangle$, of the $A^{\\ast}$ and $M$ particles. The Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution for the relative speed $v$ between two particles of reduced mass $\\mu$ at temperature $T$ is given by:\n$$f(v) = 4\\pi \\left( \\frac{\\mu}{2\\pi k_{B} T} \\right)^{3/2} v^{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\mu v^{2}}{2 k_{B} T}\\right)$$\nThe mean relative speed $\\langle v \\rangle$ is the first moment of this distribution, calculated as the expectation value of $v$:\n$$\\langle v \\rangle = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} v f(v) dv$$\nSubstituting the expression for $f(v)$:\n$$\\langle v \\rangle = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} v \\left[ 4\\pi \\left( \\frac{\\mu}{2\\pi k_{B} T} \\right)^{3/2} v^{2} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\mu v^{2}}{2 k_{B} T}\\right) \\right] dv$$\nWe extract the constants from the integral:\n$$\\langle v \\rangle = 4\\pi \\left( \\frac{\\mu}{2\\pi k_{B} T} \\right)^{3/2} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} v^{3} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\mu v^{2}}{2 k_{B} T}\\right) dv$$\nTo solve the integral, we let $\\alpha = \\frac{\\mu}{2 k_{B} T}$. The integral becomes $I = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} v^{3} \\exp(-\\alpha v^{2}) dv$. This is a standard Gaussian integral form. We use the substitution $x = v^{2}$, which implies $dx = 2v dv$.\n$$I = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} v^{2} \\exp(-\\alpha v^{2}) (v dv) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} x \\exp(-\\alpha x) \\left(\\frac{1}{2} dx\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} x \\exp(-\\alpha x) dx$$\nThis integral can be solved using the definition of the Gamma function, $\\int_{0}^{\\infty} t^{z} \\exp(-ct) dt = \\frac{\\Gamma(z+1)}{c^{z+1}}$.

Thus:\n$$I = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\Gamma(2)}{\\alpha^{2}} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{1!}{\\alpha^{2}} = \\frac{1}{2\\alpha^{2}}$$\nSubstituting back $\\alpha = \\frac{\\mu}{2 k_{B} T}$:\n$$I = \\frac{1}{2 \\left( \\frac{\\mu}{2 k_{B} T} \\right)^{2}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{4 (k_{B} T)^{2}}{\\mu^{2}} = \\frac{2 (k_{B} T)^{2}}{\\mu^{2}}$$\nNow we substitute this result back into the expression for $\\langle v \\rangle$:\n$$\\langle v \\rangle = 4\\pi \\left( \\frac{\\mu}{2\\pi k_{B} T} \\right)^{3/2} \\left[ \\frac{2 (k_{B} T)^{2}}{\\mu^{2}} \\right]$$\nSimplifying this expression:\n$$\\langle v \\rangle = 4\\pi \\frac{\\mu^{3/2}}{(2\\pi)^{3/2} (k_{B} T)^{3/2}} \\frac{2 (k_{B} T)^{2}}{\\mu^{2}} = \\frac{8\\pi}{2\\pi \\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\frac{(k_{B} T)^{1/2}}{\\mu^{1/2}} = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{B} T}{\\mu}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{16}{2\\pi}} \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{B} T}{\\mu}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{8 k_{B} T}{\\pi \\mu}}$$\nThis is the well-known expression for the mean relative speed.\n\nNext, we define the collisional timescale $\\tau_{\\mathrm{coll}}$ and the reactive timescale $\\tau_{\\mathrm{rxn}}(E)$. The collision frequency $Z$ of a single molecule $A^{\\ast}$ with bath gas molecules $M$ is given as $Z = n \\sigma \\langle v \\rangle$. The collisional timescale is the inverse of this frequency:\n$$\\tau_{\\mathrm{coll}} = Z^{-1} = \\frac{1}{n \\sigma \\langle v \\rangle}$$\nThe reactive timescale is given as the inverse of the microcanonical rate constant:\n$$\\tau_{\\mathrm{rxn}}(E) = \\frac{1}{k(E)}$$\nThe problem asks for the dimensionless ratio $R(E,T) = \\tau_{\\mathrm{coll}}/\\tau_{\\mathrm{rxn}}(E)$.\n$$R(E,T) = \\frac{\\tau_{\\mathrm{coll}}}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{rxn}}(E)} = \\frac{(n \\sigma \\langle v \\rangle)^{-1}}{(k(E))^{-1}} = \\frac{k(E)}{n \\sigma \\langle v \\rangle}$$\nWe now substitute the given and derived expressions for $\\sigma$ and $\\langle v \\rangle$. We are given $\\sigma = \\pi d^{2}$, and we derived $\\langle v \\rangle = \\sqrt{\\frac{8 k_{B} T}{\\pi \\mu}}$.\n$$R(E,T) = \\frac{k(E)}{n (\\pi d^{2}) \\sqrt{\\frac{8 k_{B} T}{\\pi \\mu}}}$$\nWe simplify the denominator:\n$$n (\\pi d^{2}) \\sqrt{\\frac{8 k_{B} T}{\\pi \\mu}} = n \\pi d^{2} \\frac{\\sqrt{8 k_{B} T}}{\\sqrt{\\pi \\mu}} = n d^{2} \\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{\\pi}} \\frac{\\sqrt{8 k_{B} T}}{\\sqrt{\\mu}} = n d^{2} \\sqrt{\\pi} \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}\\sqrt{k_{B} T}}{\\sqrt{\\mu}} = 2\\sqrt{2\\pi} n d^{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{k_{B} T}{\\mu}}$$\nAn alternative simplification of the denominator is:\n$$n (\\pi d^{2}) \\sqrt{\\frac{8 k_{B} T}{\\pi \\mu}} = n d^{2} \\sqrt{\\pi^{2} \\frac{8 k_{B} T}{\\pi \\mu}} = n d^{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{8 \\pi k_{B} T}{\\mu}} = 2 n d^{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\pi k_{B} T}{\\mu}}$$\nSubstituting this simplified denominator into the expression for $R(E,T)$:\n$$R(E,T) = \\frac{k(E)}{2 n d^{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\pi k_{B} T}{\\mu}}}$$\nThis expression can be rearranged into its final, most compact form:\n$$R(E,T) = \\frac{k(E)}{2 n d^{2}} \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{2 \\pi k_{B} T}}$$\nThis is the final expression, given entirely in terms of the specified variables. For context, this ratio compares the timescale of collisions to the timescale of reaction. If $R(E,T) \\ll 1$, collisions are much more frequent than reaction ($\\tau_{\\mathrm{coll}} \\ll \\tau_{\\mathrm{rxn}}(E)$), and the population of energized molecules is expected to be maintained near thermal equilibrium. This is the strong-collision, high-pressure limit of unimolecular reaction kinetics.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of classical mechanics and collision theory, presenting a standard model for elastic scattering. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary definitions, initial conditions, and a properly normalized probability distribution. Its language is objective and formal. This constitutes a standard, non-trivial problem in the field of chemical kinetics and reaction dynamics. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem is addressed in three sequential parts.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the scattering angle $\\chi(b)$ in the center-of-mass frame.\n\nIn the center-of-mass (COM) frame, the two-body collision is equivalent to the scattering of a particle with the reduced mass $\\mu = \\frac{m_{A} m_{M}}{m_{A} + m_{M}}$ from a fixed scattering center. For a hard-sphere interaction with collision diameter $d$, this center is an impenetrable sphere of radius $d$. The impact parameter $b$ is the perpendicular distance between the initial velocity vector of the projectile and the center of the target sphere. A collision occurs for $b \\leq d$.\n\nLet us consider the geometry of the collision in the COM frame. The relative velocity vector $\\mathbf{v}_{rel}$ is deflected during the specular reflection. Let $\\theta_{c}$ be the angle between the initial direction of relative motion and the line connecting the centers of the two spheres at the moment of impact. From the geometry, the relationship between the impact parameter $b$ and the collision diameter $d$ is given by $b = d \\sin(\\theta_{c})$. The angle $\\theta_{c}$ is the angle of incidence with respect to the surface normal, where the normal is along the line of centers.\n\nIn a specular reflection, the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence. The component of the relative velocity vector perpendicular to the line of centers is conserved, while the component parallel to the line of centers is reversed. The angle of deflection relative to the initial trajectory for each of these components results in a total scattering angle $\\chi$. The scattering angle $\\chi$ is the angle between the initial and final relative velocity vectors. From the geometry of reflection, the scattering angle $\\chi$ is related to the angle of incidence $\\theta_{c}$ by $\\chi = \\pi - 2\\theta_{c}$.\n\nFrom the relation $b = d \\sin(\\theta_{c})$, we can express $\\theta_{c}$ as $\\theta_{c} = \\arcsin(b/d)$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\chi$ would yield $\\chi = \\pi - 2 \\arcsin(b/d)$. An equivalent and more standard form is found by using the cosine. We note that $\\cos(\\chi) = \\cos(\\pi-2\\theta_{c}) = -\\cos(2\\theta_{c})$. Using the identity $\\cos(2\\theta_{c}) = 1 - 2\\sin^2(\\theta_{c})$, we find $\\cos(\\chi) = -(1 - 2\\sin^2(\\theta_{c})) = 2\\sin^2(\\theta_{c}) - 1$. Substituting $\\sin(\\theta_{c}) = b/d$, we have $\\cos(\\chi) = 2(b/d)^{2} - 1$.\n\nFrom the trigonometric identity $2\\arccos(x) = \\arccos(2x^{2}-1)$, we can directly write the scattering angle $\\chi$ as a function of $b$:\n$$ \\chi(b) = 2 \\arccos\\left(\\frac{b}{d}\\right) $$\nFor a head-on collision ($b=0$), $\\chi = 2 \\arccos(0) = \\pi$, which corresponds to the projectile scattering directly backwards. For a grazing collision ($b=d$), $\\chi = 2 \\arccos(1) = 0$, which corresponds to no deflection, as expected.\n\nPart 2: Derivation of the energy transfer $\\Delta E(b)$ in the laboratory frame.\n\nThe energy transferred to the bath particle $M$, which is initially at rest, is its final kinetic energy in the laboratory frame, $\\Delta E = K_{M,final} = \\frac{1}{2} m_{M} v_{M,final}^{2}$. We derive $v_{M,final}$ by transforming from the COM frame to the lab frame.\n\nThe velocity of the center of mass is constant: $\\mathbf{v}_{COM} = \\frac{m_{A}\\mathbf{v}_{A} + m_{M}\\mathbf{v}_{M}}{m_{A} + m_{M}}$. Since $M$ is initially at rest ($\\mathbf{v}_{M}=0$) and taking the initial velocity of $A$ to be $\\mathbf{v}_{A} = v \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$, we have $\\mathbf{v}_{COM} = \\frac{m_{A}}{m_{A}+m_{M}} v \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$.\nThe initial velocity of particle $M$ in the COM frame is $\\mathbf{u}_{M} = \\mathbf{v}_{M} - \\mathbf{v}_{COM} = 0 - \\mathbf{v}_{COM} = -\\frac{m_{A}}{m_{A}+m_{M}} v \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$.\nIn an elastic collision, the speed of each particle in the COM frame is conserved, so $|\\mathbf{u}_{M,final}| = |\\mathbf{u}_{M}|$. The direction of the final COM velocity $\\mathbf{u}_{M,final}$ is deflected by an angle from the initial direction. The angle between the initial and final velocity of particle $M$ in the COM frame is $\\pi-\\chi$. However, it is more direct to relate the lab frame final velocity to the COM velocities.\n\nThe final velocity of particle $M$ in the lab frame is $\\mathbf{v}_{M,final} = \\mathbf{u}_{M,final} + \\mathbf{v}_{COM}$.\nThe magnitude squared is $v_{M,final}^{2} = |\\mathbf{u}_{M,final} + \\mathbf{v}_{COM}|^{2} = u_{M,final}^{2} + v_{COM}^{2} + 2 \\mathbf{u}_{M,final} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{COM}$.\nWe have $u_{M,final} = u_{M} = \\frac{m_{A}}{m_{A}+m_{M}} v$, and $v_{COM} = \\frac{m_{A}}{m_{A}+m_{M}} v$. Thus, $u_{M,final} = v_{COM}$.\nThe initial COM velocity of $M$ is $\\mathbf{u}_{M}$. The vector $\\mathbf{v}_{COM}$ is antiparallel to $\\mathbf{u}_{M}$. The scattering angle $\\chi$ is the angle between the initial and final relative velocities. Since $\\mathbf{u}_{M}$ is antiparallel to the initial relative velocity $\\mathbf{v}_{rel} = \\mathbf{v}_{A}$, the angle between $\\mathbf{u}_{M,final}$ and $\\mathbf{u}_{M}$ must be $\\pi - \\chi$. Therefore, the angle between $\\mathbf{u}_{M,final}$ and $\\mathbf{v}_{COM}$ is $\\chi$.\nThis gives $\\mathbf{u}_{M,final} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{COM} = u_{M,final} v_{COM} \\cos(\\chi) = v_{COM}^{2} \\cos(\\chi)$.\n\nSubstituting this into the expression for $v_{M,final}^{2}$:\n$v_{M,final}^{2} = v_{COM}^{2} + v_{COM}^{2} + 2 v_{COM}^{2} \\cos(\\chi) = 2v_{COM}^{2} (1 + \\cos(\\chi))$. This is incorrect. The angle between $\\mathbf{u}_{M, final}$ and its initial direction, $\\mathbf{u}_{M}$, is $\\chi$. The angle between $\\mathbf{u}_{M, final}$ and $\\mathbf{v}_{COM}$ is $\\pi - \\chi$. Let's reconsider.\n\nThe change in COM velocity of particle $M$ is $\\Delta \\mathbf{u}_{M} = \\mathbf{u}_{M, final} - \\mathbf{u}_{M, initial}$. Its magnitude is related to the scattering angle $\\chi$. The angle between $\\mathbf{u}_{M, initial}$ and $\\mathbf{u}_{M, final}$ is $\\chi$. My previous statement was correct. Let's re-verify the dot product. $\\mathbf{u}_{M, initial}$ is along $-\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. $\\mathbf{v}_{COM}$ is along $+\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$. The angle between $\\mathbf{u}_{M,final}$ and $\\mathbf{u}_{M,initial}$ is $\\chi$. So the angle between $\\mathbf{u}_{M,final}$ and $\\mathbf{v}_{COM}$ is $\\pi-\\chi$.\nSo, $\\mathbf{u}_{M,final} \\cdot \\mathbf{v}_{COM} = u_{M} v_{COM} \\cos(\\pi-\\chi) = -u_{M}v_{COM}\\cos(\\chi) = -v_{COM}^{2} \\cos(\\chi)$.\nTherefore, $v_{M,final}^{2} = v_{COM}^{2} + v_{COM}^{2} - 2 v_{COM}^{2} \\cos(\\chi) = 2v_{COM}^{2} (1 - \\cos(\\chi))$.\nThe transferred energy is $\\Delta E = \\frac{1}{2} m_{M} v_{M,final}^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} m_{M} \\left[ 2v_{COM}^{2} (1 - \\cos(\\chi)) \\right] = m_{M} v_{COM}^{2} (1 - \\cos(\\chi))$.\nSubstituting $v_{COM} = \\frac{m_{A}}{m_{A}+m_{M}} v$:\n$\\Delta E = m_{M} \\left(\\frac{m_{A}}{m_{A}+m_{M}} v\\right)^{2} (1 - \\cos(\\chi)) = \\frac{m_{A}^{2} m_{M}}{(m_{A}+m_{M})^{2}} v^{2} (1 - \\cos(\\chi))$.\nThe initial kinetic energy is $E = \\frac{1}{2} m_{A} v^{2}$, so $v^{2} = \\frac{2E}{m_{A}}$.\n$\\Delta E = \\frac{m_{A}^{2} m_{M}}{(m_{A}+m_{M})^{2}} \\frac{2E}{m_{A}} (1 - \\cos(\\chi)) = \\frac{2 m_{A} m_{M}}{(m_{A}+m_{M})^{2}} E (1 - \\cos(\\chi))$.\nNow, substitute $\\cos(\\chi) = 2(b/d)^{2} - 1$ from Part 1.\n$1 - \\cos(\\chi) = 1 - (2(b/d)^{2} - 1) = 2 - 2(b/d)^{2} = 2\\left(1 - \\frac{b^{2}}{d^{2}}\\right)$.\nThe energy transfer as a function of impact parameter is:\n$$ \\Delta E(b) = \\frac{2 m_{A} m_{M}}{(m_{A}+m_{M})^{2}} E \\cdot 2\\left(1 - \\frac{b^{2}}{d^{2}}\\right) = \\frac{4 m_{A} m_{M}}{(m_{A}+m_{M})^{2}} E \\left(1 - \\frac{b^{2}}{d^{2}}\\right) $$\n\nPart 3: Calculation of the mean energy transfer per collision, $\\langle \\Delta E \\rangle$.\n\nWe are given the probability density function for the impact parameter $b$, $f(b) = \\frac{2b}{d^{2}}$ for $b$ on the interval $[0, d]$. The mean energy transfer is defined as $\\langle \\Delta E \\rangle = \\int_{0}^{d} \\Delta E(b) f(b) \\, \\mathrm{d}b$.\nSubstituting the expressions for $\\Delta E(b)$ and $f(b)$:\n$$ \\langle \\Delta E \\rangle = \\int_{0}^{d} \\left[ \\frac{4 m_{A} m_{M}}{(m_{A}+m_{M})^{2}} E \\left(1 - \\frac{b^{2}}{d^{2}}\\right) \\right] \\left( \\frac{2b}{d^{2}} \\right) \\mathrm{d}b $$\nThe terms that do not depend on $b$ can be moved outside the integral:\n$$ \\langle \\Delta E \\rangle = \\frac{8 m_{A} m_{M} E}{(m_{A}+m_{M})^{2}d^{2}} \\int_{0}^{d} \\left(1 - \\frac{b^{2}}{d^{2}}\\right) b \\, \\mathrm{d}b $$\nWe evaluate the definite integral:\n$$ \\int_{0}^{d} \\left( b - \\frac{b^{3}}{d^{2}} \\right) \\mathrm{d}b = \\left[ \\frac{b^{2}}{2} - \\frac{b^{4}}{4d^{2}} \\right]_{0}^{d} = \\left( \\frac{d^{2}}{2} - \\frac{d^{4}}{4d^{2}} \\right) - (0) = \\frac{d^{2}}{2} - \\frac{d^{2}}{4} = \\frac{d^{2}}{4} $$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $\\langle \\Delta E \\rangle$:\n$$ \\langle \\Delta E \\rangle = \\frac{8 m_{A} m_{M} E}{(m_{A}+m_{M})^{2}d^{2}} \\left( \\frac{d^{2}}{4} \\right) $$\nThe $d^{2}$ terms cancel, and the numerical factor simplifies to $\\frac{8}{4} = 2$.\nThe final expression for the mean energy transfer per collision is:\n$$ \\langle \\Delta E \\rangle = \\frac{2 m_{A} m_{M}}{(m_{A}+m_{M})^{2}} E $$\nThis is the required closed-form analytic expression.

A complete solution will now be developed.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe tasks will be addressed in sequential order.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of the Rate Expression**\n\nThe Lindemann-Hinshelwood mechanism for the association reaction $A + B \\rightarrow AB$, catalyzed by a bath gas $M$, is composed of three elementary steps:\n1. Formation of an energized complex $AB^*$: $A + B \\xrightarrow{k_a} AB^*$\n2. Unimolecular dissociation of the complex: $AB^* \\xrightarrow{k_{-a}} A + B$\n3. Collisional stabilization of the complex: $AB^* + M \\xrightarrow{k_s} AB + M$\n\nThe net rate of formation of the product $AB$ is given by $v = \\frac{d[AB]}{dt} = k_s [AB^*] [M]$.\n\nWe apply the steady-state approximation to the energized intermediate $AB^*$:\n$$ \\frac{d[AB^*]}{dt} = k_a [A] [B] - k_{-a} [AB^*] - k_s [AB^*] [M] \\approx 0 $$\nSolving for the steady-state concentration $[AB^*]$:\n$$ [AB^*] (k_{-a} + k_s [M]) = k_a [A] [B] $$\n$$ [AB^*] = \\frac{k_a [A] [B]}{k_{-a} + k_s [M]} $$\nSubstituting this expression for $[AB^*]$ into the rate law for $AB$:\n$$ v = k_s [M] \\left( \\frac{k_a [A] [B]}{k_{-a} + k_s [M]} \\right) = \\frac{k_a k_s [M]}{k_{-a} + k_s [M]} [A] [B] $$\nThe overall pressure-dependent bimolecular rate coefficient $k(T,p)$ is defined by $v = k(T,p) [A] [B]$. Therefore:\n$$ k(T,p) = \\frac{k_a k_s [M]}{k_{-a} + k_s [M]} $$\nWe identify the limiting forms:\n- High-pressure limit ($[M] \\rightarrow \\infty$): $k(T,p) \\rightarrow \\frac{k_a k_s [M]}{k_s [M]} = k_a \\equiv k_{\\infty}(T)$.\n- Low-pressure limit ($[M] \\rightarrow 0$): The overall reaction is termolecular, $A+B+M \\rightarrow AB+M$, with rate $v = k_0(T) [A][B][M]$. The bimolecular coefficient becomes $k(T,p) = k_0(T)[M]$. Equating this with our derived expression in the limit $[M] \\rightarrow 0$ gives $k(T,p) \\rightarrow \\frac{k_a k_s [M]}{k_{-a}} = k_0(T)[M]$, which defines the termolecular rate coefficient $k_0(T) = \\frac{k_a k_s}{k_{-a}}$.\n\nTo express $k(T,p)$ in terms of $k_0(T)$ and $k_{\\infty}(T)$, we rearrange the expression. From the definitions, we find $\\frac{k_s}{k_{-a}} = \\frac{k_0(T)}{k_{\\infty}(T)}$. We divide the numerator and denominator of the expression for $k(T,p)$ by $k_{-a}$:\n$$ k(T,p) = \\frac{k_a (k_s/k_{-a}) [M]}{1 + (k_s/k_{-a}) [M]} = \\frac{k_{\\infty}(T) (k_0(T)/k_{\\infty}(T)) [M]}{1 + (k_0(T)/k_{\\infty}(T)) [M]} $$\n$$ k(T,p) = \\frac{k_0(T) [M]}{1 + \\frac{k_0(T) [M]}{k_{\\infty}(T)}} = \\frac{k_0(T) k_{\\infty}(T) [M]}{k_{\\infty}(T) + k_0(T) [M]} $$\nThis is the required expression. The assumptions of a strong collider and energy-independent deactivation are implicit in the use of a single, pressure-independent stabilization rate constant $k_s$.\n\n**Task 2: Calculation of Bath Gas Density $[M]$**\n\nThe number density $[M]$ is calculated from the ideal gas law, $p = [M] k_B T$. We must use consistent units.\n$$ [M] = \\frac{p}{k_B T} $$\nGiven $T = 700\\ \\mathrm{K}$ and $k_B = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}\\ \\mathrm{J\\ K^{-1}}$. The product is $k_B T = (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23}) \\times 700 = 9.664543 \\times 10^{-21}\\ \\mathrm{J}$.\nPressures must be converted from Torr to Pascals ($1\\ \\mathrm{Pa} = 1\\ \\mathrm{J\\ m^{-3}}$) using $1\\ \\mathrm{Torr} = 133.322\\ \\mathrm{Pa}$. The resulting density in $\\mathrm{molecules\\ m^{-3}}$ must then be converted to $\\mathrm{molecules\\ cm^{-3}}$ using $1\\ \\mathrm{m^3} = 10^6\\ \\mathrm{cm^3}$.\nThe conversion formula is:\n$$ [M] (\\mathrm{molecules\\ cm^{-3}}) = \\frac{p (\\mathrm{Torr}) \\times 133.322 (\\mathrm{Pa\\ Torr^{-1}})}{9.664543 \\times 10^{-21} (\\mathrm{J})} \\times 10^{-6} (\\mathrm{m^3\\ cm^{-3}}) $$\nThis simplifies to $[M] = p (\\mathrm{Torr}) \\times (1.37949 \\times 10^{16}\\ \\mathrm{molecules\\ cm^{-3}\\ Torr^{-1}})$.\n\n- For $p = 10\\ \\mathrm{Torr}$: $[M]_1 = 10 \\times (1.37949 \\times 10^{16}) = 1.37949 \\times 10^{17}\\ \\mathrm{molecules\\ cm^{-3}}$.\n- For $p = 50\\ \\mathrm{Torr}$: $[M]_2 = 50 \\times (1.37949 \\times 10^{16}) = 6.89745 \\times 10^{17}\\ \\mathrm{molecules\\ cm^{-3}}$.\n- For $p = 200\\ \\mathrm{Torr}$: $[M]_3 = 200 \\times (1.37949 \\times 10^{16}) = 2.75898 \\times 10^{18}\\ \\mathrm{molecules\\ cm^{-3}}$.\n- For $p = 700\\ \\mathrm{Torr}$: $[M]_4 = 700 \\times (1.37949 \\times 10^{16}) = 9.65643 \\times 10^{18}\\ \\mathrm{molecules\\ cm^{-3}}$.\n\n**Task 3: Inversion of Rate Expression and Inference of $k_{\\infty}(T)$**\n\nWe start from the derived expression and invert it to solve for $k_{\\infty}(T)$. A convenient path is to take the reciprocal:\n$$ \\frac{1}{k(T,p)} = \\frac{k_{\\infty}(T) + k_0(T) [M]}{k_0(T) k_{\\infty}(T) [M]} = \\frac{1}{k_0(T) [M]} + \\frac{1}{k_{\\infty}(T)} $$\nRearranging for $k_{\\infty}(T)$:\n$$ \\frac{1}{k_{\\infty}(T)} = \\frac{1}{k(T,p)} - \\frac{1}{k_0(T) [M]} $$\n$$ k_{\\infty}(T) = \\left( \\frac{1}{k(T,p)} - \\frac{1}{k_0(T) [M]} \\right)^{-1} $$\nWe now use the given $k_0(T) = 3.00 \\times 10^{-28}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{6}\\ molecule^{-2}\\ s^{-1}}$ and the data pairs $(k, [M])$.\n\n- **Point 1 ($p=10\\ \\mathrm{Torr}$):**\n$k_1 = 2.927 \\times 10^{-11}$, $[M]_1 = 1.37949 \\times 10^{17}$.\n$k_0 [M]_1 = (3.00 \\times 10^{-28}) \\times (1.37949 \\times 10^{17}) = 4.13847 \\times 10^{-11}$.\n$1/k_{\\infty,1} = \\frac{1}{2.927 \\times 10^{-11}} - \\frac{1}{4.13847 \\times 10^{-11}} = (3.41647 - 2.41634) \\times 10^{10} = 1.00013 \\times 10^{10}$.\n$k_{\\infty,1} = 9.9987 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{3}\\ molecule^{-1}\\ s^{-1}}$.\n\n- **Point 2 ($p=50\\ \\mathrm{Torr}$):**\n$k_2 = 6.748 \\times 10^{-11}$, $[M]_2 = 6.89745 \\times 10^{17}$.\n$k_0 [M]_2 = (3.00 \\times 10^{-28}) \\times (6.89745 \\times 10^{17}) = 2.06924 \\times 10^{-10}$.\n$1/k_{\\infty,2} = \\frac{1}{6.748 \\times 10^{-11}} - \\frac{1}{2.06924 \\times 10^{-10}} = (1.48192 - 0.48327) \\times 10^{10} = 0.99865 \\times 10^{10}$.\n$k_{\\infty,2} = 1.00135 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{3}\\ molecule^{-1}\\ s^{-1}}$.\n\n- **Point 3 ($p=200\\ \\mathrm{Torr}$):**\n$k_3 = 8.921 \\times 10^{-11}$, $[M]_3 = 2.75898 \\times 10^{18}$.\n$k_0 [M]_3 = (3.00 \\times 10^{-28}) \\times (2.75898 \\times 10^{18}) = 8.27694 \\times 10^{-10}$.\n$1/k_{\\infty,3} = \\frac{1}{8.921 \\times 10^{-11}} - \\frac{1}{8.27694 \\times 10^{-10}} = (1.12095 - 0.12082) \\times 10^{10} = 1.00013 \\times 10^{10}$.\n$k_{\\infty,3} = 9.9987 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{3}\\ molecule^{-1}\\ s^{-1}}$.\n\n- **Point 4 ($p=700\\ \\mathrm{Torr}$):**\n$k_4 = 9.667 \\times 10^{-11}$, $[M]_4 = 9.65643 \\times 10^{18}$.\n$k_0 [M]_4 = (3.00 \\times 10^{-28}) \\times (9.65643 \\times 10^{18}) = 2.89693 \\times 10^{-9}$.\n$1/k_{\\infty,4} = \\frac{1}{9.667 \\times 10^{-11}} - \\frac{1}{2.89693 \\times 10^{-9}} = (1.03445 - 0.03452) \\times 10^{10} = 0.99993 \\times 10^{10}$.\n$k_{\\infty,4} = 1.00007 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{3}\\ molecule^{-1}\\ s^{-1}}$.\n\n**Consistency Test:** The four inferred values for $k_{\\infty}(T)$ are $0.9999 \\times 10^{-10}$, $1.0014 \\times 10^{-10}$, $0.9999 \\times 10^{-10}$, and $1.0001 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{3}\\ molecule^{-1}\\ s^{-1}}$. These values are highly consistent, differing by only about $0.15\\%$. This result demonstrates that the measured data conform very well to the simple Lindemann-Hinshelwood model with the given $k_0(T)$, validating the strong-collider assumption for this system under these conditions.\n\n**Task 4: Best Estimate for $k_{\\infty}(T)$**\n\nThe best estimate is the arithmetic mean of the four inferred values:\n$$ \\bar{k}_{\\infty}(T) = \\frac{k_{\\infty,1} + k_{\\infty,2} + k_{\\infty,3} + k_{\\infty,4}}{4} $$\n$$ \\bar{k}_{\\infty}(T) = \\frac{(0.99987 + 1.00135 + 0.99987 + 1.00007) \\times 10^{-10}}{4} $$\n$$ \\bar{k}_{\\infty}(T) = \\frac{4.00116 \\times 10^{-10}}{4} = 1.00029 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{3}\\ molecule^{-1}\\ s^{-1}} $$\nRounding this result to three significant figures, as required, gives:\n$$ \\bar{k}_{\\infty}(T) = 1.00 \\times 10^{-10}\\ \\mathrm{cm^{3}\\ molecule^{-1}\\ s^{-1}} $$\nThis constitutes the final answer.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{1.00 \\times 10^{-10}}\n$$", "id": "2633364"}]}
