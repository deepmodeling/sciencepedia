It is scientifically grounded in the Smoluchowski model of diffusion-controlled reactions, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent information, and uses objective, formal language. We may therefore proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe problem considers a stationary spherical reactant $A$ of radius $R$ and a point-like reactant $B$ diffusing towards it. The concentration of $B$, denoted as $c(r)$ where $r$ is the radial distance from the center of $A$, is governed by the steady-state diffusion equation. In the steady state, the continuity equation is $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} = 0$, where $\\mathbf{J}$ is the flux vector of $B$. According to Fick's first law, $\\mathbf{J} = -D \\nabla c$, where $D$ is the relative diffusion coefficient. Combining these two laws yields Laplace's equation for the concentration:\n$$D \\nabla^2 c = 0 \\implies \\nabla^2 c = 0$$\nGiven the spherical symmetry of the problem, we use the Laplacian operator in spherical coordinates. For a concentration $c$ that depends only on the radial coordinate $r$, this becomes:\n$$\\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dc}{dr} \\right) = 0$$\nThis is an ordinary differential equation for the concentration profile $c(r)$. Integrating once with respect to $r$ gives:\n$$r^2 \\frac{dc}{dr} = C_1$$\nwhere $C_1$ is a constant of integration. Separating variables and integrating again gives the general solution for $c(r)$:\n$$\\frac{dc}{dr} = \\frac{C_1}{r^2} \\implies c(r) = -\\frac{C_1}{r} + C_2$$\nwhere $C_2$ is a second constant of integration. These constants are determined by the boundary conditions provided.\nThe first boundary condition is that the concentration of $B$ far from the sphere $A$ is the bulk concentration, $c(r \\to \\infty) = c_{\\infty}$. Applying this to the general solution:\n$$c_{\\infty} = \\lim_{r \\to \\infty} \\left( -\\frac{C_1}{r} + C_2 \\right) = 0 + C_2 \\implies C_2 = c_{\\infty}$$\nThe second boundary condition is that the sphere $A$ is \"perfectly absorbing,\" which means any molecule of $B$ that reaches the surface at $r=R$ reacts instantly. This implies the concentration of $B$ at the surface is zero: $c(R) = 0$. Applying this condition:\n$$0 = -\\frac{C_1}{R} + c_{\\infty} \\implies C_1 = R c_{\\infty}$$\nSubstituting the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ back into the general solution, we obtain the steady-state concentration profile of $B$:\n$$c(r) = c_{\\infty} \\left( 1 - \\frac{R}{r} \\right)$$\nThe next step is to calculate the total diffusive influx of $B$ onto the surface of sphere $A$. The radial flux density $J_r(r)$ is given by Fick's first law:\n$$J_r(r) = -D \\frac{dc}{dr} = -D \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( c_{\\infty} \\left( 1 - \\frac{R}{r} \\right) \\right) = -D c_{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{R}{r^2} \\right)$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the flux is directed inward, towards the origin. The total influx, $\\mathcal{J}$, is the number of $B$ molecules crossing the surface of the sphere at $r=R$ per unit time. It is found by multiplying the magnitude of the flux density at $r=R$ by the surface area of the sphere, $A_{sphere} = 4\\pi R^2$.\n$$\\mathcal{J} = |J_r(R)| \\times A_{sphere} = \\left( D c_{\\infty} \\frac{R}{R^2} \\right) \\times (4\\pi R^2) = \\frac{D c_{\\infty}}{R} \\times (4\\pi R^2)$$\n$$\\mathcal{J} = 4\\pi D R c_{\\infty}$$\nThis expression represents the rate of reaction (in molecules per second) for a single molecule of $A$. To find the overall reaction rate per unit volume, $V_{\\text{rate}}$, we multiply this single-molecule rate by the number concentration of $A$, denoted $c_A$. We also identify the far-field concentration of $B$, $c_\\infty$, with the bulk number concentration $c_B$.\n$$V_{\\text{rate}} = \\mathcal{J} \\times c_A = (4\\pi D R) c_A c_B$$\nThe units of $c_A$ and $c_B$ are molecules per volume (e.g., molecules/$\\text{m}^3$), and the unit of $V_{\\text{rate}}$ is molecules per volume per time. This is a second-order rate expression.\n\nThe problem demands the rate constant $k_S$ in units of $\\text{M}^{-1}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$, which corresponds to a standard chemical rate law expressed in molar concentrations.

For a first-order reaction process, the population of reactants $N(t)$ would decay exponentially, $N(t) = N(0)\\exp(-kt)$, governed by a rate equation $\\frac{dN}{dt} = -kN$. The rate constant is then $k = -\\frac{1}{N(t)}\\frac{dN(t)}{dt}$.\nIn our single-particle problem, the analogous quantity to the reactant population is the survival probability $S(t)$, the probability that the particle has not yet been absorbed by time $t$. This is given by $S(t) = \\int_{t}^{\\infty} f(t') dt'$. The rate of change of the survival probability is $\\frac{dS(t)}{dt} = -f(t)$.\nAn effective, time-dependent rate constant can be defined as $k(t) = -\\frac{1}{S(t)}\\frac{dS(t)}{dt} = \\frac{f(t)}{S(t)}$. A well-defined macroscopic rate constant requires that $k(t)$ approaches a non-zero constant in the long-time limit, $t \\to \\infty$.\n\nWe analyze the asymptotic behavior of $f(t)$ and $S(t)$ as $t\\to\\infty$.\nFor large $t$, the argument of the exponential in $f(t)$ approaches zero, so $\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x_{0}^{2}}{4Dt}\\right) \\to 1$.

The physical reason for this behavior lies in the nature of one-dimensional diffusion. The particle performs a recurrent random walk, meaning it is certain to return to the origin, but the time it takes can be arbitrarily long. As time progresses, the reaction rate is limited by the diffusive return of particles that have wandered far from the sink, a process that becomes progressively slower. The depletion zone around the sink grows as $\\sqrt{Dt}$, and the flux of probability current into the sink diminishes accordingly, leading to the $k(t) \\propto t^{-1}$ behavior. This is in stark contrast to three dimensions, where diffusion is transient and a steady-state flux can be established, yielding a well-defined rate constant.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{x_{0}}{\\sqrt{4\\pi D t^3}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{x_{0}^{2}}{4Dt}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2639332"}, {"introduction": "Biological and catalytic reactions often occur not on uniformly reactive surfaces, but at specific active sites.

The total charge on the cap is $Q = \\int_{S_{cap}} \\sigma dS = -\\epsilon_0 \\int_{S_{cap}} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial r}|_{r=a} dS$. The capacitance of the cap is $C_{elec} = Q/V_0$.\nSince $u(r,\\theta)$ is equivalent to $V(r,\\theta)$ with $V_0=1$, we can write:\n$$ \\int_{S_{cap}} \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r} \\bigg|_{r=a} dS = \\int_{S_{cap}} \\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial r} \\bigg|_{r=a} dS = -\\frac{Q}{\\epsilon_0} = -\\frac{C_{elec}V_0}{\\epsilon_0} = -\\frac{C_{elec}}{\\epsilon_0} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $k$:\n$$ k = -D \\left(-\\frac{C_{elec}}{\\epsilon_0}\\right) = D \\frac{C_{elec}}{\\epsilon_0} $$\nThis relation correctly connects the diffusion rate constant to the electrostatic capacitance.\n\nThe problem requires the leading-order term for a small reactive cap, $\\theta_0 \\ll 1$. In this limit, the radius of the circular cap, $R_{cap} = a \\sin\\theta_0$, is much smaller than the radius of the sphere, $a$. The curvature of the sphere becomes negligible on the scale of the cap. The problem locally approximates to finding the flux to a circular absorbing disk of radius $R_{cap}$ situated on an infinite reflecting plane.\nIn the electrostatic analogy, this corresponds to finding the capacitance of a conducting disk of radius $R_{cap}$ on an infinite insulating plane. This is a classic result. The capacitance of a thin, isolated conducting disk of radius $R$ in free space is $C_{free\\_disk} = 8\\epsilon_0 R$. This is the total charge on both sides of the disk. For a disk on an insulating plane, charge accumulates only on one side (the side exposed to the electric field), which, by symmetry, is half of the total charge of the free disk for the same potential. Therefore, the capacitance of a disk on an insulating plane is:\n$$ C_{elec} = \\frac{1}{2} C_{free\\_disk} = 4\\epsilon_0 R_{cap} $$\nIn the limit $\\theta_0 \\ll 1$, the radius of the cap is $R_{cap} = a \\sin\\theta_0 \\approx a \\theta_0$. Thus, the leading-order expression for the capacitance is:\n$$ C_{elec} \\approx 4\\epsilon_0 a \\theta_0 $$\nSubstituting this result into our expression for the rate constant $k$:\n$$ k = D \\frac{C_{elec}}{\\epsilon_0} \\approx D \\frac{4\\epsilon_0 a \\theta_0}{\\epsilon_0} $$\nThis gives the final leading-order result for the capture rate constant:\n$$ k = 4 D a \\theta_0 $$\nThis result is expressed in terms of the given parameters $D$, $a$, and $\\theta_0$, and has the correct physical dimensions of volume per time ($[L^2 T^{-1}] \\cdot [L] \\cdot [1] = [L^3 T^{-1}]$).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4Da\\theta_{0}}$$", "id": "2639412"}]}
