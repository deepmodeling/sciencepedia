It describes a canonical problem in the theory of diffusion-influenced reactions, based on the Smoluchowski model with a Collins-Kimball radiation boundary condition. All parameters and conditions are specified, and the methodology requested—utilizing the backward equation for a first-passage probability—is appropriate and standard for this class of problem. There are no logical contradictions, factual errors, or ambiguities. We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe quantity of interest is the geminate recombination probability $Y(r_{0})$, defined as the probability that a pair of particles, starting at an initial relative separation $r_{0}$, will eventually react at the surface $r=a$ rather than escaping to infinite separation. This is a classic first-passage problem. The probability $Y(r_{0})$ is a time-independent property of the system that depends only on the starting position $r_{0}$. It must satisfy the backward Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the forward Smoluchowski diffusion equation.\n\nFor a free diffusion process in three dimensions with diffusion coefficient $D$, the backward operator $\\mathcal{L}^{\\dagger}$ acting on a function of the initial coordinate $r_{0}$ is the Laplacian, $\\mathcal{L}^{\\dagger} = D\\nabla_{r_{0}}^{2}$. The recombination probability $Y(r_{0})$ is the probability of hitting the reactive boundary at $r=a$ before escaping to infinity. As a stationary probability, it must satisfy the steady-state backward equation, which is Laplace's equation:\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}^{\\dagger} Y(r_{0}) = D\\nabla_{r_{0}}^{2} Y(r_{0}) = 0\n$$\nAssuming spherical symmetry, we write the Laplacian in radial coordinates:\n$$\nD \\left( \\frac{d^{2}Y}{dr_{0}^{2}} + \\frac{2}{r_{0}} \\frac{dY}{dr_{0}} \\right) = 0\n$$\nThis ordinary differential equation is valid for the domain $r_{0} > a$. The general solution is found by elementary integration, yielding:\n$$\nY(r_{0}) = C_{1} + \\frac{C_{2}}{r_{0}}\n$$\nwhere $C_{1}$ and $C_{2}$ are constants of integration to be determined by the boundary conditions.\n\nWe must now establish the correct boundary conditions for $Y(r_{0})$.\n\n1.  At infinite separation, $r_{0}\\to\\infty$: A pair starting infinitely far apart in a three-dimensional transient random walk has zero probability of ever meeting. Therefore, the recombination probability must be zero.\n    $$\n    \\lim_{r_{0}\\to\\infty} Y(r_{0}) = 0\n    $$\n    Applying this condition to the general solution gives $C_{1} = 0$. The solution is thus simplified to:\n    $$\n    Y(r_{0}) = \\frac{C_{2}}{r_{0}}\n    $$\n\n2.  At the reactive surface, $r_{0}=a$: The problem specifies a Collins-Kimball (radiation) boundary condition, characterized by an intrinsic surface reactivity $\\kappa$. This condition implies that upon encounter at $r=a$, reaction is not certain. In the context of the backward equation for the reaction probability $Y(r_{0})$, the radiation boundary condition takes the form of a Robin condition. It relates the flux of probability to the difference in probability values across the boundary. The probability of being in the \"reacted\" state is, by definition, $1$. Therefore, the boundary condition on $Y(r_0)$ at $r_0=a$ is given by:\n    $$\n    D \\frac{dY}{dr_{0}} \\bigg|_{r_{0}=a} = \\kappa \\left[ Y(a) - 1 \\right]\n    $$\n    The term $D \\frac{dY}{dr_{0}}$ represents the diffusive flux of probability at the boundary, which is driven by the \"probability potential\" difference between the state at the boundary, $Y(a)$, and the fully reacted state, $1$. The constant of proportionality is the reactivity $\\kappa$.\n\nWe now apply this second boundary condition to determine the constant $C_{2}$. First, we compute the derivative of our solution $Y(r_{0}) = C_{2}/r_{0}$:\n$$\n\\frac{dY}{dr_{0}} = -\\frac{C_{2}}{r_{0}^{2}}\n$$\nSubstituting this and $Y(a) = C_{2}/a$ into the boundary condition at $r_{0}=a$:\n$$\nD \\left( -\\frac{C_{2}}{a^{2}} \\right) = \\kappa \\left( \\frac{C_{2}}{a} - 1 \\right)\n$$\nWe solve this algebraic equation for $C_{2}$:\n$$\n-\\frac{D C_{2}}{a^{2}} = \\frac{\\kappa C_{2}}{a} - \\kappa\n$$\n$$\n\\kappa = C_{2} \\left( \\frac{\\kappa}{a} + \\frac{D}{a^{2}} \\right)\n$$\n$$\n\\kappa = C_{2} \\left( \\frac{\\kappa a + D}{a^{2}} \\right)\n$$\n$$\nC_{2} = \\frac{\\kappa a^{2}}{\\kappa a + D}\n$$\nInserting this constant back into the expression for $Y(r_{0})$ yields the complete solution for the geminate recombination probability as a function of the initial separation:\n$$\nY(r_{0}) = \\frac{1}{r_{0}} \\left( \\frac{\\kappa a^{2}}{\\kappa a + D} \\right) = \\frac{a}{r_{0}} \\left( \\frac{\\kappa a}{\\kappa a + D} \\right)\n$$\nThe problem requires the evaluation of the limit $Y \\equiv \\lim_{\\epsilon\\to 0^{+}} Y(a+\\epsilon)$, which physically corresponds to the recombination probability for a pair created at contact. Taking the limit $r_{0} \\to a$:\n$$\nY = \\lim_{r_{0}\\to a} Y(r_{0}) = \\frac{a}{a} \\left( \\frac{\\kappa a}{\\kappa a + D} \\right) = \\frac{\\kappa a}{\\kappa a + D}\n$$\nThis expression can be rearranged into a more suggestive form:\n$$\nY = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{D}{\\kappa a}}\n$$\nThis limiting value, $Y$, represents the probability of immediate, in-cage recombination. Its form elegantly encodes the competition between two kinetic pathways available to the contact pair. The term $\\kappa a$ and the term $D$ both have units of $L^{2}T^{-1}$, corresponding to rates. The expression is a classic branching ratio. The numerator represents the \"rate\" of reaction ($\\propto \\kappa a$), while the denominator represents the sum of the \"rates\" of reaction and diffusive separation ($\\propto D$). Thus, $Y$ is the probability that the reaction pathway is chosen over the escape pathway when the geminate pair is formed inside the solvent cage, i.e., at contact. This is the precise mathematical expression of the cage-controlled immediate recombination limit.\nIn the limit of infinitely fast intrinsic chemistry ($\\kappa \\to \\infty$), $Y \\to 1$, representing certain recombination, which is the Smoluchowski limit for a pair at contact.

This partitioning is a local event at the reactive surface $r=a$. The other parameters of the system, such as the diffusion coefficient $D$, the potential of mean force $U(r)$, and the contact radius $a$, influence the overall probability that the pair ever reaches the reactive surface in the first place, rather than escaping to infinity. These parameters determine the absolute yields $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ (and their sum $Y_1 + Y_2$), but not their ratio as defined in the problem. The question is a test of discerning which physical parameters govern which aspects of the process. The branching ratio of cage products is an intrinsic property of the reactive boundary itself.\n\nThe final answer is the vector $(B_1, B_2)$.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{k_{a,1}}{k_{a,1} + k_{a,2}} & \\frac{k_{a,2}}{k_{a,1} + k_{a,2}} \\end{pmatrix}} $$", "id": "2674353"}]}
