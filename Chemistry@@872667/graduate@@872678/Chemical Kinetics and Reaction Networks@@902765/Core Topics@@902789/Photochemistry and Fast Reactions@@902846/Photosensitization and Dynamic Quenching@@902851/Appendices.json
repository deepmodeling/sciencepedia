The derivation will be based on Fick's laws of diffusion for a steady-state process and the Stokes–Einstein relation for the diffusion coefficients.\n\nFirst, we model the bimolecular encounter between the excited sensitizer, $S^*$, and the quencher, $Q$. In a reference frame centered on a particle of $S^*$, the particles of $Q$ diffuse towards it. The problem is equivalent to a single particle diffusing with a relative diffusion coefficient $D = D_{S^*} + D_{Q}$ towards a stationary absorbing sphere of radius $R = a_{S^*} + a_{Q}$. Here, $a_{S^*}$ and $a_{Q}$ are the hydrodynamic radii of the respective species.\n\nLet $c(r)$ be the concentration (number density) of species $Q$ at a distance $r$ from the center of the $S^*$ particle. In a steady state, the concentration profile is governed by the time-independent diffusion equation in spherical coordinates, which simplifies from Fick's second law:\n$$D \\nabla^2 c(r) = D \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( r^2 \\frac{dc}{dr} \\right) = 0$$\nIntegrating this twice with respect to $r$ yields the general solution for the concentration profile:\n$$c(r) = C_1 + \\frac{C_2}{r}$$\nwhere $C_1$ and $C_2$ are integration constants. We determine these constants using the boundary conditions of the physical system.\n1. Far from the sink, the concentration of $Q$ approaches its bulk value, $[Q]_{bulk}$: $c(r) \\to [Q]_{bulk}$ as $r \\to \\infty$. This implies $C_1 = [Q]_{bulk}$.\n2. The reaction is assumed to occur upon every encounter, meaning the sphere of radius $R$ is a perfect sink. The concentration at the encounter radius is zero: $c(R) = 0$. This gives $0 = [Q]_{bulk} + \\frac{C_2}{R}$, which implies $C_2 = -R [Q]_{bulk}$.\n\nThus, the steady-state concentration profile of the quencher $Q$ around the sensitizer $S^*$ is:\n$$c(r) = [Q]_{bulk} \\left( 1 - \\frac{R}{r} \\right)$$\nThe flux density, $J(r)$, of $Q$ particles towards the central $S^*$ particle is given by Fick's first law:\n$$J(r) = -D \\frac{dc}{dr} = -D \\frac{d}{dr} \\left( [Q]_{bulk} \\left( 1 - \\frac{R}{r} \\right) \\right) = -D [Q]_{bulk} \\left( \\frac{R}{r^2} \\right)$$\nThe rate of encounters for a single $S^*$ particle is the total flux of a large number of $Q$ particles through the spherical surface at $r=R$. We denote this rate by $I$ (in units of molecules s$^{-1}$):\n$$I = -4 \\pi R^2 J(R) = -4 \\pi R^2 \\left( -D [Q]_{bulk} \\frac{R}{R^2} \\right) = 4 \\pi D R [Q]_{bulk}$$\nThe total reaction rate per unit volume, Rate$_{vol}$, is the encounter rate for a single $S^*$ multiplied by the concentration of $S^*$, which is $[S^*]_{bulk}$:\n$$\\text{Rate}_{vol} = I [S^*]_{bulk} = (4 \\pi D R) [S^*]_{bulk} [Q]_{bulk}$$\nThis rate is expressed in terms of number densities (e.g., molecules m$^{-3}$). The macroscopic rate law is defined in terms of molar concentrations (e.g., mol L$^{-1}$), denoted by square brackets, as $\\text{Rate} = k_{\\mathrm{diff}} [S^*] [Q]$. Comparing the microscopic and macroscopic rate laws requires a unit conversion. The microscopic rate constant is $k'_{\\mathrm{diff}} = 4 \\pi D R$ (units: m$^3$ s$^{-1}$). To convert to macroscopic units of L mol$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ (or M$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$), we multiply by Avogadro's constant $N_A$ and the volume conversion factor $1000$ L m$^{-3}$:\n$$k_{\\mathrm{diff}} = 1000 N_A k'_{\\mathrm{diff}} = 4000 \\pi N_A D R$$\nNext, we express the diffusion coefficient $D$ using the Stokes–Einstein relation. For a spherical particle of radius $a_i$ in a fluid of viscosity $\\eta$ at temperature $T$, the diffusion coefficient under stick boundary conditions is:\n$$D_i = \\frac{k_B T}{6 \\pi \\eta a_i}$$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.\nThe relative diffusion coefficient is $D = D_{S^*} + D_{Q}$.

In the presence of a dynamic quencher $Q$, the total decay rate is the sum of the intrinsic decay rate $(k_{\\mathrm{r}} + k_{\\mathrm{nr},0})$ and the quenching rate $k_q[Q]$. The lifetime in the absence of quencher is $\\tau_0 = 1/(k_{\\mathrm{r}} + k_{\\mathrm{nr},0})$. Therefore, the lifetime in the presence of the quencher is $\\tau = 1/(k_{\\mathrm{r}} + k_{\\mathrm{nr},0} + k_q[Q])$.\n\nThe lifetime-based Stern–Volmer relationship is:\n$$ \\frac{\\tau_0}{\\tau} = \\frac{k_{\\mathrm{r}} + k_{\\mathrm{nr},0} + k_q[Q]}{k_{\\mathrm{r}} + k_{\\mathrm{nr},0}} = 1 + \\frac{k_q}{k_{\\mathrm{r}} + k_{\\mathrm{nr},0}}[Q] = 1 + k_q\\tau_0 [Q]$$\nThis is a linear relationship with a slope, the dynamic quenching constant $K_{SV}^{\\mathrm{dyn}} = k_q\\tau_0$. Importantly, neither static quenching (which affects ground-state molecules) nor inner-filter effects (which are optical artifacts) alter the intrinsic decay rate of the uncomplexed, excited molecules. Thus, the lifetime-based plot exclusively measures dynamic quenching. The measured slope $m_\\tau$ is the true dynamic Stern–Volmer constant.\n$$ m_\\tau = K_{SV}^{\\mathrm{dyn}} = 12.0\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1} $$\n\nThe steady-state fluorescence intensity $I$ is affected by all three phenomena: dynamic quenching, static quenching, and inner-filter effects (IFE). The total observed intensity ratio $(I_0/I)_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ can be expressed as a product of terms representing each effect:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{I_0}{I}\\right)_{\\mathrm{obs}} = \\left(\\frac{I_0}{I}\\right)_{\\mathrm{dyn}} \\times \\left(\\frac{I_0}{I}\\right)_{\\mathrm{static}} \\times \\left(\\frac{I_0}{I}\\right)_{\\mathrm{IFE}} $$\n- **Dynamic quenching** reduces the fluorescence quantum yield. The ratio is $(\\Phi_0/\\Phi) = (\\tau_0/\\tau) = 1 + K_{SV}^{\\mathrm{dyn}}[Q]$.\n- **Static quenching** reduces the concentration of fluorophores available for excitation. Assuming the equilibrium $S + Q \\rightleftharpoons S\\cdot Q$ with association constant $K_S = [S\\cdot Q]/([S][Q])$, the fraction of uncomplexed fluorophore is $1/(1 + K_S[Q])$. The intensity is proportional to this fraction, so $(I_0/I)_{\\mathrm{static}} = 1 + K_S[Q]$.\n- **Inner-filter effect** attenuates both the excitation light before it reaches the fluorophore and the emitted light before it reaches the detector. For right-angle geometry in a cuvette of dimension $L$, and assuming low absorbance, the correction factor is approximately $C_{IF} = 10^{(A_{\\mathrm{ex}}+A_{\\mathrm{em}})/2}$, where the absorbances are due to the quencher: $A_{\\mathrm{ex}} = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ex}}[Q]L$ and $A_{\\mathrm{em}} = \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{em}}[Q]L$. The observed intensity is $I_{\\mathrm{obs}} = I_{\\mathrm{true}} / C_{IF}$, so the observed intensity ratio is $(I_0/I)_{\\mathrm{obs}} = (I_0/I)_{\\mathrm{true}} \\times C_{IF}$.\nThe full expression for the observed ratio is:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{I_0}{I}\\right)_{\\mathrm{obs}} = (1 + K_{SV}^{\\mathrm{dyn}}[Q]) (1 + K_S[Q]) \\times 10^{\\frac{L}{2}(\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ex}} + \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{em}})[Q]} $$\nThe initial slope of the intensity-based plot, $m_I$, is thus the sum of three contributions:\n$$ m_I = K_{SV}^{\\mathrm{dyn}} + K_S + \\Delta m_{\\mathrm{IF}} $$\nwhere $\\Delta m_{\\mathrm{IF}} = \\ln(10)\\frac{L}{2}(\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ex}} + \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{em}})$ is the contribution from the inner-filter effect.\nThe discrepancy between the two measured slopes is:\n$$ m_I - m_\\tau = (K_{SV}^{\\mathrm{dyn}} + K_S + \\Delta m_{\\mathrm{IF}}) - K_{SV}^{\\mathrm{dyn}} = K_S + \\Delta m_{\\mathrm{IF}} $$\nThe problem is to determine a valid strategy to disentangle the contributions from static quenching ($K_S$) and inner filter ($\\Delta m_{\\mathrm{IF}}$) to this difference.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**A.** Because $m_\\tau \\ne 0$, dynamic quenching is present and static quenching is excluded; therefore the excess of $m_I$ over $m_\\tau$ must be ignored as a detection artifact, and $m_\\tau$ should always be taken as the true dynamic Stern–Volmer constant without further checks.\n**Incorrect**. The presence of dynamic quenching does not logically exclude the possibility of static quenching; both can occur concurrently. The excess slope $m_I - m_\\tau$ is not an arbitrary artifact to be ignored but contains quantifiable physical information about static quenching and/or inner-filter effects. A scientist must analyze, not ignore, such discrepancies.\n\n**B.** Use the Beer–Lambert law to estimate and correct for inner-filter attenuation of both excitation and emission to obtain a corrected intensity $I_{\\mathrm{corr}}$; then compare the corrected intensity slope $m_{I,\\mathrm{corr}}$ to $m_\\tau$. If $m_{I,\\mathrm{corr}} \\approx m_\\tau$ within experimental error, the original discrepancy was due to inner filter. If a residual excess remains, construct the ratio $(I_0/I_{\\mathrm{corr}})/(\\tau_0/\\tau)$ versus $[Q]$; a linear increase indicates a static component.\n**Correct**. This describes a rigorous and standard procedure. First, one corrects the raw intensity data for the known inner-filter artifact: $I_{\\mathrm{corr}} = I_{\\mathrm{obs}} \\times 10^{\\frac{L}{2}(\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ex}} + \\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{em}})[Q]}$. A new plot of $(I_0/I_{\\mathrm{corr}})$ versus $[Q]$ would yield a slope $m_{I,\\mathrm{corr}} \\approx K_{SV}^{\\mathrm{dyn}} + K_S$. Comparing this to $m_\\tau = K_{SV}^{\\mathrm{dyn}}$ isolates the static quenching contribution. If they are equal, static quenching is absent. If they differ, the second proposed step, plotting the ratio $(I_0/I_{\\mathrm{corr}})/(\\tau_0/\\tau) = (1+K_{SV}^{\\mathrm{dyn}}[Q])(1+K_S[Q]) / (1+K_{SV}^{\\mathrm{dyn}}[Q]) = 1 + K_S[Q]$, is the definitive method to isolate and quantify $K_S$.\n\n**C.** Increase the excitation irradiance so that the sample emits more strongly; when $I_0/I$ visually matches $\\tau_0/\\tau$ over the same $[Q]$ range, the inner-filter effect is proven and no static quenching can be present.\n**Incorrect**. Fluorescence intensity ratios ($I_0/I$) are, in the absence of saturation or other non-linear optical effects, independent of the incident excitation irradiance. Increasing laser power will increase both $I_0$ and $I$, but their ratio will remain unchanged. This proposed method has no basis in photophysical principles.\n\n**D.** Average the slopes, $(m_I + m_\\tau)/2$, to compensate for inner-filter effects and use this average as the best estimate of the dynamic quenching strength; any deviation of $m_I$ from this average indicates static quenching.\n**Incorrect**. This is an ad-hoc mathematical manipulation without physical justification. The average of the slopes does not represent a meaningful physical parameter. The best estimate of the dynamic quenching strength is given directly by $m_\\tau$.\n\n**E.** Decide the presence or absence of static quenching solely by the linearity of the intensity-based Stern–Volmer plot: if $I_0/I$ is linear in $[Q]$, static quenching is absent; if it is curved upward, static quenching is present.\n**Incorrect**. This is an oversimplification. While the combination of static and dynamic quenching introduces a term proportional to $[Q]^2$ leading to upward curvature, the inner-filter effect also introduces non-linearity. The shape of the uncorrected intensity plot is a convolution of multiple effects and cannot be used to reliably diagnose static quenching without first correcting for the inner-filter effect.\n\n**F.** Compute the predicted inner-filter contribution to the apparent intensity slope at low $[Q]$ from the absorptivities and path length, and subtract it from $m_I$. If $m_I - \\Delta m_{\\mathrm{IF}} \\approx m_\\tau$, the discrepancy is attributable to inner filter. Alternatively, form the ratio $(I_0/I_{\\mathrm{corr}})/(\\tau_0/\\tau)$ versus $[Q]$ after inner-filter correction; a concentration-independent ratio indicates no static quenching, whereas a linear increase with $[Q]$ diagnoses static quenching and yields its equilibrium slope.\n**Correct**. This option presents two valid and complementary diagnostic approaches. The first approach is a sound analytical check: calculate the expected slope contribution from IFE, $\\Delta m_{\\mathrm{IF}}$, and see if it accounts for the discrepancy, i.e., if $m_I - m_\\tau \\approx \\Delta m_{\\mathrm{IF}}$. This is a direct test of the hypothesis. The second approach is the same rigorous method described in option B: perform a full IFE correction on the data and then use the ratio $(I_0/I_{\\mathrm{corr}})/(\\tau_0/\\tau)$ to isolate the static quenching component.

This relation assumes that measured intensities are free from optical attenuation; when inner-filter effects are present, we must correct the observed fluorescence to recover $I$.\n\nInner-filter correction under right-angle detection:\nThe observed fluorescence $F_{\\mathrm{obs}}$ relates to the inner-filter-free fluorescence $F_{\\mathrm{true}}$ through two multiplicative attenuation factors, one for excitation light and one for emitted light. For the standard right-angle geometry with small collection angle, a common and well-justified approximation for the correction factor involves evaluating the attenuation at the center of the cuvette (average path length of $l/2$ for both excitation and emission paths):\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{obs}}=F_{\\mathrm{true}}\\times 10^{-\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ex}}c\\,(l/2)}\\times 10^{-\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{em}}c\\,(l/2)}.\n$$\nIntroducing the absorbances $A_{\\mathrm{ex}}=\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ex}}cl$ and $A_{\\mathrm{em}}=\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{em}}cl$, we obtain the widely used right-angle correction formula:\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{obs}}=F_{\\mathrm{true}}\\,10^{-\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{ex}}+A_{\\mathrm{em}}}{2}},\\quad\\text{so that}\\quad F_{\\mathrm{corr}}\\equiv F_{\\mathrm{true}}=F_{\\mathrm{obs}}\\,10^{\\frac{A_{\\mathrm{ex}}+A_{\\mathrm{em}}}{2}}.\n$$\n\nApplication to the data:\nWe are given $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{ex}}=160\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, $\\varepsilon_{\\mathrm{em}}=80\\,\\mathrm{M}^{-1}\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, and $l=1.00\\,\\mathrm{cm}$.
