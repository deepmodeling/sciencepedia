Since the coefficient $\\Delta\\Delta H^{\\mathrm{diss}}/R$ is positive, the term $\\ln(K_I(T)/K_I'(T))$ is a strictly decreasing function of $T$. Consequently, the ratio $K_I(T)/K_I'(T)$ itself is a strictly decreasing function of $T$.\n\nAt the special temperature $T^\\ast$, we are given $K_I(T^\\ast) = K_I'(T^\\ast)$, which means $K_I(T^\\ast)/K_I'(T^\\ast) = 1$.\nNow we can deduce the inhibition pattern as a function of temperature relative to $T^\\ast$:\n-   For $T  T^\\ast$: Since the ratio is a decreasing function of $T$, we must have $\\frac{K_I(T)}{K_I'(T)}  \\frac{K_I(T^\\ast)}{K_I'(T^\\ast)} = 1$. Thus $K_I(T)  K_I'(T)$. This corresponds to **uncompetitive-like** inhibition.\n-   For $T = T^\\ast$: We have $\\frac{K_I(T^\\ast)}{K_I'(T^\\ast)} = 1$. Thus $K_I(T^\\ast) = K_I'(T^\\ast)$. This corresponds to **pure noncompetitive** inhibition, where all LB lines intersect on the $x$-axis.\n-   For $T  T^\\ast$: We must have $\\frac{K_I(T)}{K_I'(T)}  \\frac{K_I(T^\\ast)}{K_I'(T^\\ast)} = 1$. Thus $K_I(T)  K_I'(T)$. This corresponds to **competitive-like** inhibition.\n\nIn summary, as temperature $T$ increases through $T^\\ast$, the inhibition pattern transitions from uncompetitive-like to pure noncompetitive, and then to competitive-like.\n\nNow we evaluate each option:\n\n**A. As $T$ increases through $T^\\ast$, the family shifts from uncompetitive-like at low $T$ (approximately parallel lines with increased $y$-intercepts) to competitive-like at high $T$ (lines intersecting near the $y$-axis), passing through a unique pure noncompetitive pattern at $T = T^\\ast$ where all inhibited lines share the same $x$-intercept as the uninhibited line.**\nThis statement precisely matches our derived conclusion. The transition is correctly identified as uncompetitive-like $\\rightarrow$ pure noncompetitive $\\rightarrow$ competitive-like with increasing temperature. The description of pure noncompetitive inhibition at $T=T^\\ast$ is correct: the $x$-intercept is invariant. The qualitative descriptions for uncompetitive-like (\"approximately parallel\") and competitive-like (\"intersecting near the $y$-axis\") are standard and appropriate characterizations of the line geometries in these cases.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. As $T$ increases through $T^\\ast$, the family shifts from competitive-like at low $T$ to uncompetitive-like at high $T$, and there is no temperature at which the $x$-intercept is preserved across inhibitor levels.**\nThis statement claims the transition occurs in the opposite direction (competitive-like to uncompetitive-like), which contradicts our derivation based on $\\Delta H_I^{\\mathrm{diss}}  \\Delta H_{I'}^{\\mathrm{diss}}$. It also incorrectly claims that a pure noncompetitive pattern (preserved $x$-intercept) is never observed, which contradicts the explicit existence of $T^\\ast$ where $K_I(T^\\ast)=K_I'(T^\\ast)$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Regardless of the relative enthalpies, the family always becomes more competitive with increasing $T$ because higher $T$ accelerates catalysis and forces $V_{\\max}$ changes to dominate the LB geometry.**\nThis statement is flawed. The direction of the transition is critically dependent on the sign of $\\Delta H_I^{\\mathrm{diss}} - \\Delta H_{I'}^{\\mathrm{diss}}$. If this sign were reversed, the transition would proceed from competitive-like to uncompetitive-like. Therefore, the phrase \"Regardless of the relative enthalpies\" is false. Furthermore, the reasoning provided is non-physical. The change in inhibition *pattern* is governed by the relative temperature dependence of $K_I$ and $K_I'$, not a vague notion of catalysis acceleration dominating the geometry.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The family at any $T$ cannot display a pure noncompetitive pattern unless $[I] \\rightarrow \\infty$, so there is no temperature at which the $x$-intercept is invariant across inhibitor levels.**\nThis statement is fundamentally wrong. A pure noncompetitive pattern is observed when $K_I = K_I'$, which is a condition independent of the inhibitor concentration $[I]$. The problem explicitly states that such a condition is met at temperature $T^\\ast$. The claim that this requires $[I] \\to \\infty$ is nonsensical. As a direct consequence, the conclusion that the $x$-intercept is never invariant is also false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2670269"}]}
