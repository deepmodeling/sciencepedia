This energy is defined as the change in the conformational free energy difference upon the binding of one ligand molecule.\n$\\Delta G_{\\text{coupling}} = \\Delta G_{\\text{conf}}^{(1)} - \\Delta G_{\\text{conf}}^{(0)}$\n\nHere, $\\Delta G_{\\text{conf}}^{(0)}$ is the standard Gibbs free energy difference between the tense ($T$) and relaxed ($R$) states in the absence of ligand ($m=0$), and $\\Delta G_{\\text{conf}}^{(1)}$ is the same difference when one ligand molecule is bound ($m=1$).\n\nWe consider the following four states and the equilibria connecting them, forming a thermodynamic cycle:\n_1._ $R_0$: The receptor in the relaxed state, unliganded.\n_2._ $T_0$: The receptor in the tense state, unliganded.\n_3._ $R_1M$: The receptor in the relaxed state, bound to one ligand molecule $M$.\n_4._ $T_1M$: The receptor in the tense state, bound to one ligand molecule $M$.\n\nThe equilibria are characterized by the following standard free energy changes:\nThe conformational equilibrium in the absence of ligand is $R_0 \\rightleftharpoons T_0$. The equilibrium constant is defined as $L_0 = [T_0]/[R_0]$. The corresponding standard free energy change is:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{conf}}^{(0)} = G^\\circ_{T_0} - G^\\circ_{R_0} = -RT \\ln(L_0) $$\n\nThe conformational equilibrium in the presence of one bound ligand is $R_1M \\rightleftharpoons T_1M$. We define its equilibrium constant as $L_1 = [T_1M]/[R_1M]$. The corresponding standard free energy change is:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{conf}}^{(1)} = G^\\circ_{T_1M} - G^\\circ_{R_1M} = -RT \\ln(L_1) $$\n\nLigand binding to the $R$ state is described by $R_0 + M \\rightleftharpoons R_1M$. The dissociation constant is $K_R = \\frac{[R_0][M]}{[R_1M]}$. The standard free energy of binding is related to the association constant ($1/K_R$):\n$$ \\Delta G^\\circ_{\\text{bind},R} = G^\\circ_{R_1M} - G^\\circ_{R_0} - G^\\circ_{M} = -RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{K_R}\\right) = RT \\ln(K_R) $$\n\nLigand binding to the $T$ state is described by $T_0 + M \\rightleftharpoons T_1M$. The dissociation constant is $K_T = \\frac{[T_0][M]}{[T_1M]}$.

We can state that the free energy change between two states is path-independent. Let us consider the transition from the state ($R_0 + M$) to $T_1M$ via two paths.\n\nPath 1: First, ligand binds to $R_0$. Second, the complex changes conformation.\n$R_0 + M \\to R_1M \\to T_1M$\nThe total free energy change is $\\Delta G_{\\text{path 1}} = \\Delta G^\\circ_{\\text{bind},R} + \\Delta G_{\\text{conf}}^{(1)}$.\n\nPath 2: First, the receptor changes conformation. Second, ligand binds to $T_0$.\n$R_0 + M \\to T_0 + M \\to T_1M$\nThe total free energy change is $\\Delta G_{\\text{path 2}} = \\Delta G_{\\text{conf}}^{(0)} + \\Delta G^\\circ_{\\text{bind},T}$.\n\nEquating the free energy changes of both paths:\n$$ \\Delta G^\\circ_{\\text{bind},R} + \\Delta G_{\\text{conf}}^{(1)} = \\Delta G_{\\text{conf}}^{(0)} + \\Delta G^\\circ_{\\text{bind},T} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for each term:\n$$ RT \\ln(K_R) + (-RT \\ln(L_1)) = (-RT \\ln(L_0)) + RT \\ln(K_T) $$\nDividing by $RT$:\n$$ \\ln(K_R) - \\ln(L_1) = -\\ln(L_0) + \\ln(K_T) $$\nRearranging to solve for $\\ln(L_1)$:\n$$ \\ln(L_1) = \\ln(L_0) + \\ln(K_R) - \\ln(K_T) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{L_0 K_R}{K_T}\\right) $$\nThis gives the relation $L_1 = L_0 \\frac{K_R}{K_T}$. Using the given definition $c = K_R/K_T$, we have $L_1 = c L_0$.\n\nNow we can derive the expression for the coupling free energy:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{coupling}} = \\Delta G_{\\text{conf}}^{(1)} - \\Delta G_{\\text{conf}}^{(0)} $$\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{coupling}} = (-RT \\ln(L_1)) - (-RT \\ln(L_0)) $$\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{coupling}} = RT (\\ln(L_0) - \\ln(L_1)) = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{L_0}{L_1}\\right) $$\nSubstitute $L_1 = L_0 (K_R/K_T)$:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{coupling}} = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{L_0}{L_0 (K_R/K_T)}\\right) = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{K_R/K_T}\\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{coupling}} = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{K_T}{K_R}\\right) $$\nExpressed in terms of $c = K_R/K_T$, this is:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{coupling}} = RT \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{c}\\right) = -RT \\ln(c) $$\nThis is the required symbolic expression. It correctly demonstrates that the coupling energy—the extent to which ligand binding modulates the conformational equilibrium—depends only on the ratio of the ligand's affinities for the two states, not on the intrinsic conformational equilibrium $L_0$ itself.\n\n### Numerical Evaluation\n\nWe are given the following parameters:\n- $R = 8.314\\,462\\,618\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n- $T = 310\\,\\mathrm{K}$\n- $K_R = 0.10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n- $K_T = 10.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the ratio $c$:\n$$ c = \\frac{K_R}{K_T} = \\frac{0.10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}}{10.0\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}} = 0.010 $$\n\nNow, we substitute the values into the derived expression for $\\Delta G_{\\text{coupling}}$:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{coupling}} = -RT \\ln(c) $$\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{coupling}} = - (8.314\\,462\\,618\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (310\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\times \\ln(0.010) $$\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{coupling}} = - (2577.48341358\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}) \\times (-4.605170186) $$\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{coupling}} \\approx 11869.60\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} $$\n\nThe problem requires the answer in $\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$. We perform the unit conversion:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{coupling}} \\approx 11.86960\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} $$\n\nFinally, we round the answer to four significant figures as instructed:\n$$ \\Delta G_{\\text{coupling}} = 11.87\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} $$\nThis positive value signifies that ligand binding shifts the conformational equilibrium toward the relaxed ($R$) state, which is expected as the ligand has a higher affinity for the $R$ state ($K_R  K_T$).

There are $4$ ways to place the single unoccupied site, so the degeneracy is $4$. In any such configuration (e.g., three consecutive bound sites and one empty site), there are exactly two pairs of adjacent bound ligands. Thus, for these states, $n=3$ and $m=2$.

Differentiating with respect to $L$:\n$$\\frac{dL_T}{dL} = 1 + N R_T \\frac{d\\theta}{dL}$$\nTo find $\\frac{d\\theta}{dL}$, we use $\\frac{d\\theta}{dL} = \\frac{d\\theta}{d\\alpha}\\frac{d\\alpha}{dL} = \\frac{1}{K_R} \\frac{d\\theta}{d\\alpha}$. We compute $\\frac{d\\theta}{d\\alpha}$ by differentiating $\\ln \\theta$:\n$$\\ln \\theta = \\ln \\alpha + (N-1)\\ln(1+\\alpha) - \\ln((1+\\alpha)^N + L_0)$$\n$$\\frac{1}{\\theta} \\frac{d\\theta}{d\\alpha} = \\frac{1}{\\alpha} + \\frac{N-1}{1+\\alpha} - \\frac{N(1+\\alpha)^{N-1}}{(1+\\alpha)^N + L_0}$$\nAt $\\theta=1/2$, $\\alpha=3$, $N=4$, $L_0=128$:\n$$\\left. \\frac{d\\theta}{d\\alpha} \\right|_{\\alpha=3} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{4(1+3)^3}{(1+3)^4+128} \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{4 \\cdot 64}{256+128} \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{256}{384} \\right]$$\nSince $256/384 = 2/3$:\n$$\\left. \\frac{d\\theta}{d\\alpha} \\right|_{\\alpha=3} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{2}{3} \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{3}{4} - \\frac{1}{3} \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ \\frac{9-4}{12} \\right] = \\frac{5}{24}$$\nSo, $\\left. \\frac{d\\theta}{dL} \\right|_{\\theta=1/2} = \\frac{1}{K_R} \\frac{5}{24}$. Now we find $\\frac{dL_T}{dL}$ at $\\theta=1/2$:\n$$\\left. \\frac{dL_T}{dL} \\right|_{\\theta=1/2} = 1 + N R_T \\left( \\frac{1}{K_R} \\frac{5}{24} \\right) = 1 + \\frac{N R_T}{K_R} \\frac{5}{24}$$\nUsing the given values $N=4$, $R_T=150\\,\\mathrm{nM}$, $K_R=100\\,\\mathrm{nM}$:\n$$\\left. \\frac{dL_T}{dL} \\right|_{\\theta=1/2} = 1 + \\frac{4 \\cdot 150}{100} \\frac{5}{24} = 1 + 6 \\cdot \\frac{5}{24} = 1 + \\frac{30}{24} = 1 + \\frac{5}{4} = \\frac{9}{4}$$\nTherefore, $\\left. \\frac{dL}{dL_T} \\right|_{\\theta=1/2} = \\frac{4}{9}$.\nNext, we need the ratio $L_T/L$ at $\\theta=1/2$. At this point, $L = 3 K_R = 3(100\\,\\mathrm{nM}) = 300\\,\\mathrm{nM}$.\n$$L_T = L + N R_T \\theta = 300\\,\\mathrm{nM} + (4)(150\\,\\mathrm{nM})(1/2) = 300\\,\\mathrm{nM} + 300\\,\\mathrm{nM} = 600\\,\\mathrm{nM}$$\nThe ratio is $L_T/L = 600/300 = 2$. Now we can compute the scaling factor for the derivative:\n$$\\left. \\frac{d \\ln L}{d \\ln L_T} \\right|_{\\theta=1/2} = \\frac{L_T}{L} \\frac{dL}{dL_T} = 2 \\cdot \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{8}{9}$$\nThe apparent Hill coefficient is:\n$$n_H^{\\mathrm{app}} = n_H^{\\mathrm{true}} \\cdot \\frac{8}{9} = \\frac{5}{2} \\cdot \\frac{8}{9} = \\frac{40}{18} = \\frac{20}{9}$$\n\nFinally, we compute the bias $\\Delta n_H = n_H^{\\mathrm{app}} - n_H^{\\mathrm{true}}$:\n$$\\Delta n_H = \\frac{20}{9} - \\frac{5}{2} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 20 - 9 \\cdot 5}{18} = \\frac{40 - 45}{18} = -\\frac{5}{18}$$\nThe ligand depletion causes the experimentalist to underestimate the true Hill coefficient. The final result for the bias is $-\\frac{5}{18}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-\\frac{5}{18}}$$", "id": "2626392"}]}
