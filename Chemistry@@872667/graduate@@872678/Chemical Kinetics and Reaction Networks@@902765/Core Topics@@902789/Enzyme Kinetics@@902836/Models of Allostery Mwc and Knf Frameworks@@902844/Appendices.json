The $i$-th step of this macroscopic process is the equilibrium:\n$$\nPL_{i-1} + L \\rightleftharpoons PL_i\n$$\nBy definition, the corresponding Adair association constant $K^{(A)}_i$ is given by the law of mass action applied to the total concentrations of the macrostates:\n$$\nK^{(A)}_i = \\frac{[PL_i]}{[PL_{i-1}][L]}\n$$\nTo derive an expression for $K^{(A)}_i$, we must relate these macroscopic concentrations to the underlying microscopic states.

The problem states that due to symmetry, all microstates with the same number of bound ligands have equal concentration.

The equilibrium between these states in the absence of ligand is given by the allosteric constant $L = [T]_0/[R]_0$. The ligand $X$ can bind to each of the two identical and independent sites on either conformation. The microscopic dissociation constants are $K_R$ for the $R$ state and $K_T$ for the $T$ state. We are given the dimensionless quantities $c = K_R/K_T$ and $x = [X]/K_R$.\n\nThe system can exist in several microstates, distinguished by conformation ($R$ or $T$) and the number of bound ligands ($0$, $1$, or $2$). We define the statistical weight of the unbound relaxed state, $R_0$, as $1$. All other weights are relative to this reference state.\n\nFor the $R$ state, which has $2$ identical binding sites for ligand $X$ with microscopic dissociation constant $K_R$:\n-   The weight of $R_0$ (unbound) is $1$.\n-   The weight of $R_1$ (one ligand bound) is $\\binom{2}{1} \\frac{[X]}{K_R} = 2x$.\n-   The weight of $R_2$ (two ligands bound) is $\\binom{2}{2} \\left(\\frac{[X]}{K_R}\\right)^2 = x^2$.\nThe sum of weights for all species in the $R$ conformation forms the partition function for the $R$ state, $Q_R(x) = 1 + 2x + x^2 = (1+x)^2$.\n\nFor the $T$ state, the microscopic dissociation constant is $K_T = K_R/c$. The dimensionless ligand binding term is $[X]/K_T = ([X]/K_R) \\cdot (K_R/K_T) = xc$.\nThe weight of the unbound $T$ state, $T_0$, relative to $R_0$ is $L$.\n-   The weight of $T_0$ is $L$.\n-   The weight of $T_1$ is $L \\cdot \\binom{2}{1} \\frac{[X]}{K_T} = L \\cdot 2cx$.\n-   The weight of $T_2$ is $L \\cdot \\binom{2}{2} \\left(\\frac{[X]}{K_T}\\right)^2 = L \\cdot (cx)^2$.\nThe sum of weights for all species in the $T$ conformation, relative to $R_0$, is $Q_T(x) = L(1 + 2cx + (cx)^2) = L(1+cx)^2$.\n\nThe total binding polynomial, or partition function $Q(x)$, is the sum of the weights of all possible microstates:\n$$Q(x) = Q_R(x) + Q_T(x) = (1+x)^2 + L(1+cx)^2.$$\nThis is the partition function over ligation microstates.\n\nThe average number of ligands bound per dimer, $\\bar{\\nu}$, is given by the standard statistical mechanical relation:\n$$\\bar{\\nu}(x) = \\frac{d\\ln Q(x)}{d\\ln x} = x \\frac{1}{Q(x)} \\frac{dQ(x)}{dx}.$$\nFirst, we compute the derivative of $Q(x)$:\n$$\\frac{dQ(x)}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( (1+x)^2 + L(1+cx)^2 \\right) = 2(1+x) + L \\cdot 2(1+cx) \\cdot c = 2(1+x) + 2Lc(1+cx).$$\nSo, the average number of bound ligands is:\n$$\\bar{\\nu}(x) = x \\frac{2(1+x) + 2Lc(1+cx)}{(1+x)^2 + L(1+cx)^2}.$$\nThe fractional site occupancy, $Y(x)$, is the average number of occupied sites divided by the total number of sites, which is $2$ for a dimer.\n$$Y(x) = \\frac{\\bar{\\nu}(x)}{2} = x \\frac{(1+x) + Lc(1+cx)}{(1+x)^2 + L(1+cx)^2}.$$\nThis expression can be expanded as:\n$$Y(x) = \\frac{x(1+x+Lc+Lc^2x)}{(1+2x+x^2) + L(1+2cx+c^2x^2)} = \\frac{(1+Lc)x + (1+Lc^2)x^2}{(1+L) + 2(1+Lc)x + (1+Lc^2)x^2}.$$\n\nb) Parametric representation of the Scatchard plot and its curvature\n\nThe Scatchard plot graphs $Y(x)/x$ versus $Y(x)$. The parametric representation is the pair of functions $\\{Y(x), Y(x)/x\\}$, where $x$ is the parameter. From part (a), we have:\n$$Y(x) = x \\frac{(1+x) + Lc(1+cx)}{(1+x)^2 + L(1+cx)^2}$$\n$$\\frac{Y(x)}{x} = \\frac{(1+x) + Lc(1+cx)}{(1+x)^2 + L(1+cx)^2}.$$\nThe qualitative curvature of the Scatchard plot indicates the nature of the cooperativity. A concave-upward (\"humped\") plot, where $Y(x)/x$ first increases from its value at $x=0$, is a definitive sign of positive cooperativity. A monotonically decreasing plot (concave downward) signifies negative or no cooperativity. The behavior is determined by the sign of the derivative of $Y(x)/x$ at $x=0$.\nThe condition for a humped plot (positive cooperativity) is $(1+Lc^2)(1+L) - 2(1+Lc)^2  0$. This is a stricter condition than just having $c \\neq 1$. For example, for exclusive binding to the $R$ state ($c=0$), the condition becomes $1+L-2  0$, or $L1$. Thus, for exclusive binding to the $R$ state, the Scatchard plot is humped only if the protein is predominantly in the $T$ state in the absence of ligand ($L1$).\n\nc) Mapping to the Adair scheme\n\nThe Adair scheme for a two-site protein describes binding in terms of macroscopic constants. Using the problem's definitions, the concentrations of species with $0$, $1$, and $2$ ligands are $[P_0]$, $[P_1] = [P_0]\\frac{x}{\\kappa_1}$, and $[P_2] = [P_1]\\frac{x}{\\kappa_2} = [P_0]\\frac{x^2}{\\kappa_1\\kappa_2}$. The corresponding binding polynomial is:\n$$Q_{Adair}(x) = [P_0]\\left(1 + \\frac{1}{\\kappa_1}x + \\frac{1}{\\kappa_1\\kappa_2}x^2\\right).$$\nFrom part (a), the MWC binding polynomial is:\n$$Q_{MWC}(x) = (1+L) + 2(1+Lc)x + (1+Lc^2)x^2.$$\nTo map MWC to Adair, we match the coefficients of the powers of $x$. We can set the constant term $[P_0]$ in the Adair polynomial to be $1+L$.\n$$Q_{MWC}(x) = (1+L)\\left(1 + \\frac{2(1+Lc)}{1+L}x + \\frac{1+Lc^2}{1+L}x^2\\right).$$\nComparing this with the Adair form, we identify:\n$$\\frac{1}{\\kappa_1} = \\frac{2(1+Lc)}{1+L} \\implies \\kappa_1 = \\frac{1+L}{2(1+Lc)}.$$\n$$\\frac{1}{\\kappa_1\\kappa_2} = \\frac{1+Lc^2}{1+L} \\implies \\kappa_1\\kappa_2 = \\frac{1+L}{1+Lc^2}.$$\nNow we solve for $\\kappa_2$:\n$$\\kappa_2 = \\frac{\\kappa_1\\kappa_2}{\\kappa_1} = \\frac{(1+L)/(1+Lc^2)}{(1+L)/(2(1+Lc))} = \\frac{2(1+Lc)}{1+Lc^2}.$$\n\nd) Hill slope at half-saturation and diagnosis of cooperativity\n\nThe Hill slope at half-saturation ($Y=1/2$) is $n_H = \\left.\\frac{d\\ln(Y/(1-Y))}{d\\ln x}\\right|_{Y=1/2}$.\nFirst, we find an expression for the odds ratio $Y/(1-Y)$. From part (a), this is:\n$$ \\frac{Y(x)}{1-Y(x)} = x\\frac{(1+Lc)+x(1+Lc^2)}{(1+L)+x(1+Lc)}. $$\nAt half-saturation, $Y(x_{1/2})=1/2$, which implies $Y/(1-Y)=1$. Solving for $x_{1/2}$ gives:\n$$x_{1/2}^2(1+Lc^2) = 1+L \\implies x_{1/2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1+L}{1+Lc^2}}.$$\nNow we compute $n_H$ by taking the derivative of $\\ln(Y/(1-Y))$ with respect to $\\ln x$:\n$$n_H = \\frac{d\\ln(Y/(1-Y))}{d\\ln x} = 1 + \\frac{x(1+Lc^2)}{(1+Lc)+x(1+Lc^2)} - \\frac{x(1+Lc)}{(1+L)+x(1+Lc)}.$$\nWe evaluate this expression at $x=x_{1/2}$. Using the relationship $1+L = x_{1/2}^2(1+Lc^2)$, the expression simplifies considerably. After substitution and algebraic manipulation, the final closed-form expression for the Hill slope at half-saturation is:\n$$n_H = \\frac{2\\sqrt{(1+L)(1+Lc^2)}}{1+Lc+\\sqrt{(1+L)(1+Lc^2)}}.$$\nFor $c=1$ (no affinity difference), $n_H = 1$. For any $c \\ne 1$ and $L0$, it can be shown that $n_H1$, as the condition for this simplifies to $L(c-1)^2 > 0$. Thus, the MWC model always predicts positive cooperativity ($n_H > 1$) as long as the two states have different affinities for the ligand. The maximum value is $n_H=2$, achieved in the limit of exclusive binding ($c=0$ or $c \\to \\infty$) and a large allosteric constant $L$.\n\nThe cooperativity diagnostics are:\n1.  **Hill slope**: $n_H  1$ indicates positive cooperativity. For MWC, this is true whenever $c \\neq 1$.\n2.  **Scatchard plot curvature**: A concave upward shape is a hallmark of positive cooperativity. This requires a stricter condition than $n_H1$.\n3.  **Adair constants**: Apparent positive cooperativity is indicated by $4\\kappa_1 > \\kappa_2$ (accounting for statistics). This condition is equivalent to $(c-1)^2 > 0$, and holds whenever $c \\ne 1$.\n\nIn a KNF sequential model, cooperativity arises from direct interactions between subunits. This model can account for both positive cooperativity ($n_H1$) and negative cooperativity ($n_H1$), where binding of the first ligand makes the second binding event less favorable. The MWC model is structurally incapable of producing $n_H1$, a key distinguishing feature. The discordance between the conditions for sigmoidicity ($n_H1$) and a humped Scatchard plot is also a signature of the MWC concerted mechanism.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{Y(x) = \\frac{x((1+x) + Lc(1+cx))}{(1+x)^2 + L(1+cx)^2}}$$", "id": "2656245"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the theoretical underpinnings of both models, we now bridge theory with experimental practice by applying the MWC model to enzyme kinetics.
