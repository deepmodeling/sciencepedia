This deviation quantifies the energy contribution from orbital relaxation upon ionization, under the assumption that electron correlation effects are negligible.\n\nFirst, let us establish the theoretical framework.

The total electronic energy of this system at the HF level is denoted by $E_N(\\mathbf{R}_0)$.\n\nThe vertical ionization energy, $I_i$, corresponding to the removal of an electron from a specific occupied molecular orbital $i$, is defined as the difference in total energy between the final $(N-1)$-electron cation and the initial $N$-electron neutral molecule, at the fixed geometry $\\mathbf{R}_0$:\n$$I_i \\equiv E_{N-1}^{(i)}(\\mathbf{R}_0) - E_N(\\mathbf{R}_0)$$\nIn a $\\Delta$SCF calculation, the energy of the cation, $E_{N-1}^{(i)}(\\mathbf{R}_0)$, is obtained by performing a separate, new SCF calculation for the $(N-1)$-electron system.

It is a consequence of the 'frozen-orbital' approximation. In HF theory, the canonical orbital energies, $\\varepsilon_i$, emerge as Lagrange multipliers from the variational procedure. Koopmans' theorem states that if we assume the orbitals of the $(N-1)$-electron ion are identical to the orbitals of the $N$-electron parent molecule (i.e., they are 'frozen'), then the ionization energy is simply the negative of the canonical orbital energy of the removed electron:\n$$I_i^{\\text{KT}} = -\\varepsilon_i$$\nThis approximation neglects orbital relaxation.
