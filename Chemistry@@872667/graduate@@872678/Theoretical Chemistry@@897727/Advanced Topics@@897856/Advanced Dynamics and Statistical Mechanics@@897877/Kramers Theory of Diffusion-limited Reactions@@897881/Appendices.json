The inward flux density at $r=R$ is the magnitude of $\\mathbf{J}(r=R)$:\n$$\nJ_{\\text{inward}}(R) = |\\mathbf{J}(R)| = \\left| -D \\frac{c_{\\infty}R}{R^2} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}} \\right| = \\frac{D c_{\\infty}}{R}\n$$\nThis flux density is uniform over the spherical surface. The total flux $\\Phi$ is the product of this density and the surface area of the sphere, $4\\pi R^2$:\n$$\n\\Phi = J_{\\text{inward}}(R) \\times (\\text{Surface Area}) = \\left( \\frac{D c_{\\infty}}{R} \\right) (4 \\pi R^2)\n$$\n$$\n\\Phi = 4 \\pi D R c_{\\infty}\n$$\nThis completes the second part of the task.\n\nFinally, the problem defines the diffusion-limited rate constant $k$ through the relation $\\Phi = k c_{\\infty}$. By comparing this definition with our derived expression for $\\Phi$, we have:\n$$\nk c_{\\infty} = 4 \\pi D R c_{\\infty}\n$$\nAssuming a non-trivial concentration field where $c_{\\infty} \\neq 0$, we can divide by $c_{\\infty}$ to isolate the rate constant $k$:\n$$\nk = 4 \\pi D R\n$$\nThis is the celebrated Smoluchowski result for the diffusion-limited rate constant for a spherical sink.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4 \\pi D R}$$", "id": "2782641"}]}
