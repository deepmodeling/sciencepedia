The language is objective and precise. The provided constraints, such as the degeneracy at $Q=0$ and the symmetry of the average potential, are consistent with the standard theory of the Jahn-Teller effect. The problem is neither trivial nor ill-posed, but rather tests the fundamental understanding of how the parameters of a model Hamiltonian manifest in the observable adiabatic potential energy surfaces.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem statement is **valid**. We may proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n### Derivation\nIn the LVC model for a two-state system, the potential energy is represented by a $2 \\times 2$ matrix in a diabatic basis. For a single JT-active coordinate $Q$, this matrix takes the form:\n$$\n\\mathbf{V}(Q) = \\begin{pmatrix} V_0 + \\frac{1}{2}kQ^2  FQ \\\\ FQ  V_0 + \\frac{1}{2}kQ^2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nHere, $V_0$ is the energy at the degeneracy point ($Q=0$), $k$ is the harmonic force constant associated with the mean potential, and $F$ is the linear vibronic coupling constant.\n\nThe adiabatic energies $E_{\\pm}(Q)$ are the eigenvalues of this matrix. A standard calculation yields:\n$$\nE_{\\pm}(Q) = V_0 + \\frac{1}{2}kQ^2 \\pm \\sqrt{(FQ)^2} = V_0 + \\frac{1}{2}kQ^2 \\pm |F||Q|\n$$\nThese are the familiar \"Mexican hat\" potential surfaces when plotted as a function of a radial coordinate. However, the presence of the absolute value $|Q|$ introduces a non-analyticity (a \"cusp\") at $Q=0$. This makes the sign of $F$ inaccessible and complicates differentiation.\n\nThe problem specifies a \"fixed phase convention for the adiabatic states\". This implies that the adiabatic states are chosen to be smooth functions of $Q$, even if it means they cross in energy. This is achieved by performing a basis transformation that diagonalizes the potential matrix at, for instance, $Q0$ and then using this fixed transformation for all $Q$. This procedure leads to the following smoothly varying potential energy curves:\n$$\nE_{+}(Q) = V_0 + \\frac{1}{2}kQ^2 + FQ\n$$\n$$\nE_{-}(Q) = V_0 + \\frac{1}{2}kQ^2 - FQ\n$$\nHere, the labels '$+$' and '$-$' refer to the two distinct, smoothly varying states, not their energy ordering. For $F0$, $E_{+}(Q)  E_{-}(Q)$ for $Q0$, but $E_{+}(Q)  E_{-}(Q)$ for $Q0$. These are the curves that must be used for a consistent analysis that can recover the sign of $F$.\n\nWith these expressions, we form the average energy $\\bar{E}(Q)$ and the energy splitting $\\Delta E(Q)$:\n\n1.  **Average Energy**:\n    $$\n    \\bar{E}(Q) = \\frac{1}{2}[E_{+}(Q) + E_{-}(Q)] = \\frac{1}{2}[(V_0 + \\frac{1}{2}kQ^2 + FQ) + (V_0 + \\frac{1}{2}kQ^2 - FQ)] = V_0 + \\frac{1}{2}kQ^2\n    $$\n    As required by the problem statement, $\\bar{E}(Q)$ is an even function of $Q$.

The coupling constant $F$ is related to the slope of $\\Delta E(Q)$:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d(\\Delta E)}{dQ} = 2F \\implies F = \\frac{1}{2}\\frac{d(\\Delta E)}{dQ}\n    $$\n    We can estimate the first derivative at $Q=0$ using the central difference formula:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d(\\Delta E)}{dQ}\\bigg|_{Q=0} \\approx \\frac{\\Delta E(+\\delta Q) - \\Delta E(-\\delta Q)}{2\\delta Q}\n    $$\n    Substituting this into the expression for $F$:\n    $$\n    F \\approx \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\Delta E(+\\delta Q) - \\Delta E(-\\delta Q)}{2\\delta Q} \\right) = \\frac{\\Delta E(+\\delta Q) - \\Delta E(-\\delta Q)}{4\\delta Q}\n    $$\n\nThis derived protocol correctly separates the even ($k$) and odd ($F$) contributions to the potential based on symmetry, uses numerically stable finite-difference formulas that converge as $\\delta Q \\to 0$, and recovers the sign of $F$ as determined by the (arbitrary but fixed) labeling of the $E_{+}$ and $E_{-}$ states.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Compute the average and splitting at each $Q$: $\\bar{E}(Q) = \\tfrac{1}{2}\\left[E_{+}(Q)+E_{-}(Q)\\right]$ and $\\Delta E(Q)=E_{+}(Q)-E_{-}(Q)$. Estimate $k$ from the second central difference of $\\bar{E}(Q)$,\n$k \\approx \\dfrac{\\bar{E}(+\\delta Q)-2\\bar{E}(0)+\\bar{E}(-\\delta Q)}{(\\delta Q)^{2}}$,\nand estimate $F$ from the slope of the splitting at $Q=0$ using a central difference,\n$F \\approx \\dfrac{\\Delta E(+\\delta Q)-\\Delta E(-\\delta Q)}{4\\,\\delta Q}$.\nVerify linearity by checking that $\\Delta E(Q)$ is odd in $Q$ over $\\pm\\delta Q$, and ensure $Q$ is mass-weighted; the sign of $F$ follows from the ordering convention defining $E_{+}$ versus $E_{-}$ for $Q0$.**\nThis option perfectly matches the protocol derived from first principles. It correctly identifies the role of the average energy for determining $k$ and the splitting for determining $F$. The finite-difference formulas are standard and appropriate for the functions involved. The emphasis on symmetry separation and sign convention is correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Use only the lower surface $E_{-}(Q)$. Fit a quadratic $E_{-}(Q)=c_{0}+c_{1}Q+\\tfrac{1}{2}c_{2}Q^{2}$ to the three points $Q\\in\\{-\\delta Q,0,+\\delta Q\\}$ and take $k=c_{2}$ and $F=-c_{2}\\,\\delta Q$. This avoids constructing the splitting and yields both parameters from a single-surface fit.**\nThe premise of fitting one surface is plausible, as $E_{-}(Q)$ contains parameters $k$ and $F$. A fit yields $c_1 \\approx -F$ and $c_2 \\approx k$. However, the option states to use $F=-c_{2}\\,\\delta Q$. This is nonsensical. It equates $F$ (an energy/distance parameter) with $-k\\,\\delta Q$ (a force parameter). The expression for $F$ is incorrect both in its formula and dimensionally.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Construct the splitting $\\Delta E(Q)$ at $Q=\\pm\\delta Q$ and estimate $F$ from the curvature at the origin, $F\\approx \\tfrac{1}{4}\\left[\\Delta E(+\\delta Q)-2\\Delta E(0)+\\Delta E(-\\delta Q)\\right]/(\\delta Q)^{2}$, while obtaining $k$ from the second central difference of $E_{+}(Q)$ alone.**\nThis option proposes estimating $F$ from the second derivative (curvature) of the splitting $\\Delta E(Q)$. Since $\\Delta E(Q)=2FQ$ is linear in $Q$, its second derivative is zero. This formula would incorrectly estimate $F \\approx 0$. While one can obtain $k$ from the second derivative of $E_{+}(Q)$ alone, the main flaw is the method for $F$. This approach fails to recognize the correct functional forms of the underlying quantities.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Estimate both $F$ and $k$ from the average $\\bar{E}(Q)$ using forward differences at $Q=0$: take $F \\approx \\tfrac{\\bar{E}(+\\delta Q)-\\bar{E}(0)}{2\\,\\delta Q}$ and $k \\approx \\tfrac{\\bar{E}(+\\delta Q)-2\\bar{E}(0)+\\bar{E}(-\\delta Q)}{(\\delta Q)^{2}}$, since the average removes the electronic splitting and retains all needed information.**\nThis option correctly provides the formula for $k$ but incorrectly suggests that $F$ can also be obtained from the average energy $\\bar{E}(Q)$. As we derived, $\\bar{E}(Q) = V_0 + \\frac{1}{2}kQ^2$. This function contains no information about $F$. The first derivative of $\\bar{E}(Q)$ at $Q=0$ is zero, so any attempt to estimate a non-zero $F$ from it is fundamentally flawed. The claim that $\\bar{E}(Q)$ \"retains all needed information\" is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2815098"}]}
