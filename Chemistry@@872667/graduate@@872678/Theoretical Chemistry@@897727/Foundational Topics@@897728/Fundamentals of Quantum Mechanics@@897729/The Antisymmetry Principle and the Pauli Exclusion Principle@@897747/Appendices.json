We must enumerate these permutations, determine their parity (even or odd) and the corresponding sign $(-1)^{P}$, and apply the permutation operator $\\hat{P}$ to the reference Hartree product $\\Phi_{0}$.\n\nThe permutations in $S_{3}$ are:\n$1$. The identity permutation, $P_{1} = e$. This involves zero transpositions, so it is an even permutation. The sign is $(-1)^{P_{1}} = +1$.\n$\\hat{P}_{1}\\,\\Phi_{0} = \\chi_{a}(x_{1})\\chi_{b}(x_{2})\\chi_{c}(x_{3})$.\n\n$2$. The transpositions (swaps of two elements).

Applying this to each integral:\n$$\n\\langle\\Phi'_{Q}|\\Phi'_{P}\\rangle = \\delta_{Q(a), P(a)} \\delta_{Q(b), P(b)} \\delta_{Q(c), P(c)}.\n$$\nThis product of Kronecker deltas is equal to $1$ if and only if $Q(a)=P(a)$, $Q(b)=P(b)$, and $Q(c)=P(c)$. Since $P$ and $Q$ are permutations (bijective maps), this condition holds only if $Q=P$. If $Q \\neq P$, at least one pair of orbital labels will not match, and the corresponding delta will be zero, making the entire product zero. Therefore, $\\langle\\Phi'_{Q}|\\Phi'_{P}\\rangle = \\delta_{QP}$.\n\nSubstituting this result back into the sum for the normalization integral:\n$$\nC^2 \\sum_{P\\in S_{3}}\\sum_{Q\\in S_{3}}(-1)^{P}(-1)^{Q} \\delta_{QP} = 1.\n$$\nThe sum over $Q$ collapses, as only the term where $Q=P$ survives:\n$$\nC^2 \\sum_{P\\in S_{3}}(-1)^{P}(-1)^{P} = 1.\n$$\nSince $(-1)^{P}(-1)^{P} = ((-1)^P)^2 = 1$ for any permutation $P$, the expression simplifies to:\n$$\nC^2 \\sum_{P\\in S_{3}} 1 = 1.\n$$\nThe sum is over all $3! = 6$ elements of the permutation group $S_3$, so we are summing the number $1$ six times.\n$$\nC^2 \\cdot 6 = 1.\n$$\nSolving for $C$, and taking the positive real root as is conventional for the overall phase of a wavefunction:\n$$\nC^2 = \\frac{1}{6} \\implies C = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}.\n$$\nThis result is general: for a system of $N$ fermions described by a Slater determinant of $N$ orthonormal spin-orbitals, the normalization constant is $1/\\sqrt{N!}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}}$$", "id": "2810546"}, {"introduction": "The antisymmetry principle acts as a fundamental filter, selecting only physically permissible states for a system of identical fermions.

We shall proceed with its solution by rigorous application of the provided principles, without recourse to pre-tabulated formulas.\n\nThe system is defined by a Complete Active Space (CAS) with $N=2$ electrons distributed among $K_s=4$ spatial orbitals. Let these spatial orbitals be denoted as $\\{\\phi_1, \\phi_2, \\phi_3, \\phi_4\\}$. Taking into account the two possible spin states for an electron, $\\alpha$ (spin up, $m_s=+\\frac{1}{2}$) and $\\beta$ (spin down, $m_s=-\\frac{1}{2}$), we have a total of $K_{so} = 2 \\times K_s = 8$ available spin-orbitals.

For a determinant, $M_S$ is the sum of the $m_s$ values of the occupied spin-orbitals.\n\n1.  **$M_S = +1$ sector:** Both electrons must have spin $\\alpha$ ($m_s=+\\frac{1}{2}$). The two spin-orbitals must be of the form $\\phi_i\\alpha$ and $\\phi_j\\alpha$. The Pauli principle requires that the spatial orbitals be distinct, i.e., $i \\neq j$.

The number of such determinants is:\n    $$ N_{det}(M_S=+1) = \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4 \\times 3}{2} = 6 $$\n2.  **$M_S = -1$ sector:** By analogy, both electrons must have spin $\\beta$ ($m_s=-\\frac{1}{2}$).

The fundamental antisymmetry principle dictates that the total electronic wavefunction $\\Psi(1, 2)$ must be antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of any two electrons.

A symmetric triplet spin function combined with the symmetric spatial function would produce a total wavefunction that is symmetric, which violates the antisymmetry principle for fermions. There are $4$ spatial orbitals, so we can construct $4$ such singlet CSFs, one for each doubly occupied orbital configuration.\n\n**Case 2: Two electrons occupy two different spatial orbitals, $\\phi_i$ and $\\phi_j$ (where $i \\neq j$).**\nFrom two distinct spatial orbitals, we can construct both a symmetric and an antisymmetric spatial combination:\n-   Symmetric spatial function: $\\Phi_{S, ij}(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[\\phi_i(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\phi_j(\\mathbf{r}_2) + \\phi_j(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\phi_i(\\mathbf{r}_2)]$\n-   Antisymmetric spatial function: $\\Phi_{A, ij}(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[\\phi_i(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\phi_j(\\mathbf{r}_2) - \\phi_j(\\mathbf{r}_1)\\phi_i(\\mathbf{r}_2)]$\n\nThese combinations allow for both singlet and triplet couplings while satisfying the antisymmetry principle:\n-   **Singlet CSF ($S=0, M_S=0$):** We combine the symmetric spatial part with the antisymmetric spin part:\n    $$ \\Psi_{S, ij} = \\Phi_{S, ij} \\Sigma_S = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[|\\phi_i\\alpha \\, \\phi_j\\beta| + |\\phi_j\\alpha \\, \\phi_i\\beta|] $$\n    For each pair of distinct orbitals $(\\phi_i, \\phi_j)$, one singlet CSF is generated.\n-   **Triplet CSFs ($S=1$):** We combine the antisymmetric spatial part with one of the three symmetric spin parts. For the $M_S=0$ component:\n    $$ \\Psi_{T, ij} = \\Phi_{A, ij} \\Sigma_{T,0} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[|\\phi_i\\alpha \\, \\phi_j\\beta| - |\\phi_j\\alpha \\, \\phi_i\\beta|] $$\n    For each pair of distinct orbitals, one triplet state (consisting of three degenerate CSFs with $M_S = +1, 0, -1$) is generated.\n\nIn this second case, both singlet and triplet couplings are allowed because it is possible to construct both symmetric and antisymmetric spatial functions from distinct orbitals, which can then be paired with spin functions of opposite symmetry.\n\nFinally, we determine the total number of distinct singlet CSFs with $M_S=0$.\n-   From Case 1 (doubly occupied orbitals): There is one CSF for each of the $4$ spatial orbitals. This gives $4$ singlet CSFs.\n-   From Case 2 (singly occupied distinct orbitals): The number of ways to choose $2$ distinct spatial orbitals from $4$ is $\\binom{4}{2} = 6$. Each such pair yields one singlet CSF. This gives $6$ singlet CSFs.\n\nThe total number of singlet CSFs with $S=0$ and $M_S=0$ is the sum of the counts from both cases:\n$$ N_{CSF}(S=0, M_S=0) = 4 + 6 = 10 $$\nThis result is derived strictly from the antisymmetry principle and the definitions of Slater determinants and CSFs, as required.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{10}$$", "id": "2810512"}]}
