Consider the two stereoisomers cis-1,2-dichloroethylene and trans-1,2-dichloroethylene. Model each molecule as exactly planar with the carbon–carbon double bond along the $x$-axis in the $xy$-plane, and the $z$-axis perpendicular to the molecular plane. Place the carbon nuclei at $(x,y,z)=(\\pm a,0,0)$ with $a0$, and attach substituents on each carbon such that all four substituents lie in the $xy$-plane with no deviation along $z$. In the cis isomer, the two chlorine atoms lie on the same side of the $x$-axis (same sign of $y$), and the two hydrogen atoms lie on the opposite side. In the trans isomer, the chlorine atom on the left carbon and the chlorine atom on the right carbon lie on opposite sides of the $x$-axis (opposite signs of $y$), with the hydrogens arranged correspondingly.\n\nUsing only the fundamental definitions of molecular symmetry operations in three-dimensional space—namely, identity, proper rotation $C_n$ about an axis, mirror reflection $\\sigma$ in a plane, and inversion $i$ through a point—determine, for each isomer, the complete set of symmetry elements (axes, planes, center) that map the molecule onto itself, and identify the principal rotation axis as the one with highest order.

From this, a quantity $M$ must be computed, which is the difference in the number of mirror planes between the two isomers.\n\nThe analysis is performed by systematically applying the definitions of symmetry operations—identity ($E$), proper rotation ($C_n$), reflection ($\\sigma$), and inversion ($i$)—to the specified molecular geometries. The coordinate system is defined with the carbon-carbon double bond along the $x$-axis, the molecule in the $xy$-plane, and the carbon atoms at $(\\pm a, 0, 0)$ where $a  0$.\n\nAnalysis of cis-1,2-dichloroethylene:\n\nIn the cis isomer, both chlorine atoms are on one side of the $x$-axis (e.g., positive $y$ coordinates), and both hydrogen atoms are on the other side (negative $y$ coordinates). The molecule is planar and resides in the $xy$-plane.\n\n1.  Identity ($E$): The identity operation leaves the molecule unchanged and is always a symmetry element.\n\n2.  Proper Rotation ($C_n$): We test for rotation axes that map the molecule onto an indistinguishable configuration.\n    - An axis along the C=C bond (the $x$-axis): A $C_2$ rotation would exchange the positions of atoms with positive $y$ coordinates with those with negative $y$ coordinates. This would map chlorine atoms to hydrogen atoms, so it is not a symmetry operation.\n    - An axis perpendicular to the molecular plane (the $z$-axis): A $C_2$ rotation around the $z$-axis through the origin would map a point $(x, y, 0)$ to $(-x, -y, 0)$. This would map the left side of the molecule to the right side while also inverting the $y$ coordinate, again mapping chlorine atoms to hydrogen positions. This is not a symmetry operation.\n    - An axis in the molecular plane that bisects the C=C bond (the $y$-axis): A $C_2$ rotation around the $y$-axis maps a point $(x, y, z)$ to $(-x, y, -z)$. For atoms in the $xy$-plane, this is $(x, y, 0) \\to (-x, y, 0)$. This operation exchanges the carbon atom at $(-a, 0, 0)$ with the one at $(a, 0, 0)$. It also exchanges the chlorine atom on the left carbon with the chlorine atom on the right carbon, as they both have the same $y$ coordinate. Similarly, it exchanges the two hydrogen atoms. Thus, a $C_2$ axis exists along the $y$-axis. No higher-order rotation axes are present. This $C_2$ axis is the principal axis of rotation.\n\n3.  Mirror Reflection ($\\sigma$): We test for planes of reflection.\n    - The molecular plane ($xy$-plane, equation $z=0$): Reflection through this plane maps $(x, y, z) \\to (x, y, -z)$. Since all atoms lie in this plane ($z=0$), they are not moved. This is a valid symmetry operation. This is a mirror plane, which we denote $\\sigma(xy)$.\n    - A plane perpendicular to the C=C bond and bisecting it (the $yz$-plane, equation $x=0$): Reflection through this plane maps $(x, y, z) \\to (-x, y, z)$. This operation exchanges the left and right sides of the molecule and, like the $C_2(y)$ rotation, maps identical atoms onto each other. This is a valid symmetry operation. This is a mirror plane, which we denote $\\sigma(yz)$.\n    - A plane containing the C=C bond (the $xz$-plane, equation $y=0$): Reflection through this plane maps $(x, y, z) \\to (x, -y, z)$. This would map chlorine atoms (positive $y$) to hydrogen positions (negative $y$). This is not a symmetry operation.\n\n4.  Inversion ($i$): Inversion through the origin $(0, 0, 0)$ maps $(x, y, z) \\to (-x, -y, -z)$. This operation would map a chlorine atom (positive $y$) to a hydrogen position (negative $y$) on the opposite side. It is not a symmetry operation.\n\nSummary for cis-1,2-dichloroethylene:\nThe symmetry elements are a $C_2$ axis (the $y$-axis), and two mirror planes, $\\sigma(xy)$ and $\\sigma(yz)$. The corresponding symmetry operations are $E$, $C_2(y)$, $\\sigma(xy)$, and $\\sigma(yz)$. The principal axis is the $C_2$ axis. Both mirror planes, $\\sigma(xy)$ and $\\sigma(yz)$, contain the principal $C_2(y)$ axis. A point group with a $C_n$ axis and $n$ mirror planes containing the axis is designated $C_{nv}$. Here, with $n=2$, the point group is $C_{2v}$.\nThe total number of distinct mirror planes is two. Therefore, $N_{\\sigma}(\\text{cis}) = 2$.\n\nAnalysis of trans-1,2-dichloroethylene:\n\nIn the trans isomer, the two chlorine atoms are on opposite sides of the $x$-axis. The two hydrogen atoms are also on opposite sides. The arrangement is centrosymmetric.\n\n1.  Identity ($E$): Present.\n\n2.  Proper Rotation ($C_n$):\n    - An axis perpendicular to the molecular plane (the $z$-axis): A $C_2$ rotation around the $z$-axis maps a point $(x, y, z) \\to (-x, -y, z)$. For atoms in the $xy$-plane, this is $(x, y, 0) \\to (-x, -y, 0)$. This operation maps the carbon at $(-a, 0, 0)$ to $(a, 0, 0)$. It maps the chlorine atom on the left carbon (e.g., positive $y$) to the chlorine atom on the right carbon (negative $y$). Likewise, it maps the hydrogen on the left carbon (negative $y$) to the hydrogen on the right carbon (positive $y$). This is a valid symmetry operation. A $C_2$ axis exists along the $z$-axis. It is the principal axis.\n\n3.  Mirror Reflection ($\\sigma$):\n    - The molecular plane ($xy$-plane, equation $z=0$): Reflection through this plane leaves all atoms unmoved and is a symmetry operation. This is a horizontal plane of symmetry, $\\sigma_h$, as it is perpendicular to the principal $C_2(z)$ axis. We denote it $\\sigma(xy)$.\n    - No other mirror planes exist. A plane like $\\sigma(yz)$ or $\\sigma(xz)$ would map at least one chlorine atom to a position occupied by a hydrogen atom.\n\n4.  Inversion ($i$): Inversion through the origin maps $(x, y, z) \\to (-x, -y, -z)$. This operation correctly maps the carbon atoms to each other. It also maps the chlorine atom on the left carbon to the chlorine atom on the right carbon, and the hydrogen atom on the left to the hydrogen atom on the right. Thus, a center of inversion exists at the origin $(0, 0, 0)$.\n\nSummary for trans-1,2-dichloroethylene:\nThe symmetry elements are a $C_2$ axis (the $z$-axis), a center of inversion $i$, and one mirror plane $\\sigma(xy)$. The corresponding symmetry operations are $E$, $C_2(z)$, $i$, and $\\sigma_h = \\sigma(xy)$. The principal axis is the $C_2$ axis. The presence of a mirror plane $\\sigma_h$ perpendicular to the $C_n$ axis defines the point group as $C_{nh}$. Here, with $n=2$, the point group is $C_{2h}$.\nThe total number of distinct mirror planes is one. Therefore, $N_{\\sigma}(\\text{trans}) = 1$.\n\nCalculation of $M$:\n\nThe problem asks for the quantity $M = N_{\\sigma}(\\text{cis}) - N_{\\sigma}(\\text{trans})$.\nBased on the analysis:\n$N_{\\sigma}(\\text{cis}) = 2$\n$N_{\\sigma}(\\text{trans}) = 1$\nTherefore, the value of $M$ is:\n$$\nM = 2 - 1 = 1\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2906237"}, {"introduction": "The presence of certain symmetry elements has direct and profound consequences for a molecule's physical and chemical properties.

The necessary and sufficient condition for a molecule to be achiral is that its point group contains at least one orientation-reversing symmetry operation, i.e., an improper rotation $S_n$ (this includes a plane of symmetry, $\\sigma = S_1$, and a center of inversion, $i = S_2$).\n\nThe problem states that the molecule belongs to the point group $S_4$. By definition, this point group contains the symmetry operation $S_4$. Since $S_4$ is an improper rotation, the molecule is necessarily achiral.\n\nTo provide the justification requested, we now construct the effect of the $S_4$ operation on a right-handed coordinate system. Let the right-handed orthonormal triad be $\\{\\mathbf{e}_x, \\mathbf{e}_y, \\mathbf{e}_z\\}$, which can be represented by the vectors:\n$$\n\\mathbf{e}_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n\\mathbf{e}_y = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad\n\\mathbf{e}_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe handedness of this system is given by the sign of the scalar triple product, $\\mathbf{e}_x \\cdot (\\mathbf{e}_y \\times \\mathbf{e}_z) = +1$.\n\nThe $S_4$ operation along the $z$-axis is a composition of a proper rotation $C_4$ about the $z$-axis by an angle of $2\\pi/4 = \\pi/2$ radians, followed by a reflection $\\sigma_h$ through the $xy$-plane.\n\nThe matrix representation for the $C_4$ rotation about the $z$-axis is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{C}_4(z) = \\begin{pmatrix} \\cos(\\pi/2)  -\\sin(\\pi/2)  0 \\\\ \\sin(\\pi/2)  \\cos(\\pi/2)  0 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -1  0 \\\\ 1  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe matrix representation for the reflection $\\sigma_h$ through the $xy$-plane is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{\\sigma}_h(xy) = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  0 \\\\ 0  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe matrix for the $S_4$ operation is the product $\\mathbf{S}_4 = \\mathbf{\\sigma}_h \\mathbf{C}_4$:\n$$\n\\mathbf{S}_4 = \\begin{pmatrix} 1  0  0 \\\\ 0  1  0 \\\\ 0  0  -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -1  0 \\\\ 1  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  1 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0  -1  0 \\\\ 1  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  -1 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis matrix transforms a general coordinate vector $(x,y,z)^T$ as follows:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} 0  -1  0 \\\\ 1  0  0 \\\\ 0  0  -1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\\\ z \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} -y \\\\ x \\\\ -z \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nNow, we apply this transformation to the basis vectors:\n$$\n\\mathbf{e}'_x = \\mathbf{S}_4 \\mathbf{e}_x = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\mathbf{e}_y\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{e}'_y = \\mathbf{S}_4 \\mathbf{e}_y = \\begin{pmatrix} -1 \\\\ 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix} = -\\mathbf{e}_x\n$$\n$$\n\\mathbf{e}'_z = \\mathbf{S}_4 \\mathbf{e}_z = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\\\ -1 \\end{pmatrix} = -\\mathbf{e}_z\n$$\nThe new triad is $\\{\\mathbf{e}'_x, \\mathbf{e}'_y, \\mathbf{e}'_z\\} = \\{\\mathbf{e}_y, -\\mathbf{e}_x, -\\mathbf{e}_z\\}$.\n\nWe analyze the handedness of the new triad by calculating its scalar triple product:\n$$\n\\mathbf{e}'_x \\cdot (\\mathbf{e}'_y \\times \\mathbf{e}'_z) = \\mathbf{e}_y \\cdot ((-\\mathbf{e}_x) \\times (-\\mathbf{e}_z)) = \\mathbf{e}_y \\cdot (\\mathbf{e}_x \\times \\mathbf{e}_z)\n$$\nSince $\\mathbf{e}_x \\times \\mathbf{e}_z = -\\mathbf{e}_y$, the scalar triple product is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{e}_y \\cdot (-\\mathbf{e}_y) = -(\\mathbf{e}_y \\cdot \\mathbf{e}_y) = -1\n$$\nThe scalar triple product has changed sign from $+1$ to $-1$, which proves that the $S_4$ operation reverses the handedness of the coordinate system. It is an orientation-reversing operation. Its determinant is $\\det(\\mathbf{S}_4) = -1$, confirming this conclusion.\n\nSince $S_4$ is a symmetry operation of the molecule, it maps the molecule onto itself, $S_4(M) = M$. An operation that reverses orientation and maps the molecule onto itself proves that the molecule is superposable onto its mirror image. Therefore, the molecule is achiral.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\nA. The molecule is achiral. The operation $S_4$ about $z$ is the composition of $C_4$ by angle $\\pi/2$ with the reflection $\\sigma_h$ in the $xy$-plane, so on coordinates $(x,y,z)$ it acts as $(x,y,z)\\mapsto(-y,x,-z)$. Acting on the right-handed triad gives $\\mathbf{e}_x\\mapsto\\mathbf{e}_y$, $\\mathbf{e}_y\\mapsto-\\mathbf{e}_x$, $\\mathbf{e}_z\\mapsto-\\mathbf{e}_z$, which reverses the scalar triple product and hence handedness. Because $S_4$ is a symmetry of the molecule, this orientation-reversed image is superposable on the original, so the molecule equals its mirror image.\n- **Analysis**: This option correctly states the conclusion (achiral). Its description of the $S_4$ operation, its effect on coordinates, its effect on the basis vectors, and the resulting reversal of handedness are all identical to our derivation. The final sentence provides a correct logical link: an orientation-reversing symmetry operation implies achirality.\n- **Verdict**: Correct.\n\nB. The molecule is chiral. Although it has $S_4$, it lacks a mirror plane $\\sigma$ and an inversion center $i$, and only $\\sigma$ or $i$ guarantee achirality; $S_4$ alone is insufficient.\n- **Analysis**: The conclusion is incorrect. The reasoning is flawed due to the false premise that only a mirror plane ($\\sigma \\equiv S_1$) or an inversion center ($i \\equiv S_2$) can confer achirality. The presence of *any* improper rotation axis, $S_n$ for any integer $n$, is a sufficient condition for achirality.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\nC. The molecule’s chirality depends on the parity of $n$ in $S_n$: only $S_n$ with even $n$ make molecules achiral. Thus $S_4$ molecules are achiral, but $S_3$ molecules would be chiral.\n- **Analysis**: This reasoning is incorrect. The presence of an $S_n$ axis guarantees achirality for *all* values of $n$. A group generated by $S_n$ with odd $n$ will always contain a horizontal mirror plane $\\sigma_h$ (since $(S_n)^n = \\sigma_h$ for odd $n$), making the molecule manifestly achiral. Therefore, the claim that \"$S_3$ molecules would be chiral\" is false.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\nD. The molecule is chiral unless it also has a $C_2$ axis perpendicular to the $S_4$ axis; only with such an additional $C_2$ is the mirror image superposable, so $S_4$ alone does not determine achirality.\n- **Analysis**: This statement is incorrect. As proven above, the presence of the $S_4$ axis alone is a sufficient condition for achirality. The addition of other symmetry elements, such as a perpendicular $C_2$ axis (which would promote the group to $D_{2d}$), does not change the achiral nature of the molecule. The premise that $S_4$ alone is insufficient is false.\n- **Verdict**: Incorrect.\n\nOnly option A presents both a correct conclusion and a correct justification based on the requested construction.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2787759"}, {"introduction": "The true power of group theory in a chemical context is its ability to simplify complex quantum mechanical problems.

As a consistency check, the sum of the dimensions of the irreps, weighted by their multiplicities, must equal the dimension of the reducible representation. The dimension of a representation is its character for the identity element, $\\chi(\\mathrm{E})$. All irreps of $C_{2v}$ are one-dimensional, i.e., $\\chi^{\\alpha}(\\mathrm{E})=1$ for all $\\alpha$. The dimension of $\\Gamma$ is $\\chi^{\\Gamma}(\\mathrm{E}) = 12$.\nThe sum is:\n$$\n\\sum_{\\alpha} a_{\\alpha} \\chi^{\\alpha}(\\mathrm{E}) = (5)(1) + (1)(1) + (3)(1) + (3)(1) = 5 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 12\n$$\nThis sum matches the dimension of $\\Gamma$, confirming the correctness of the decomposition. The result is that the reducible representation $\\Gamma$ decomposes as $\\Gamma = 5A_1 \\oplus 1A_2 \\oplus 3B_1 \\oplus 3B_2$. The multiplicities are to be reported as a row matrix in the order $(A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 5  1  3  3 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2787794"}]}
