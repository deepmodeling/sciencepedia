The problem does not violate any scientific principles, is not ambiguous, and contains all necessary information for a rigorous analysis.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. A full solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation and Option Analysis\n\nThe fundamental definition of temperature arises from the microcanonical ensemble, where $1/T = (\\partial S/\\partial E)$. A negative temperature ($T0$) is possible only if the entropy $S$ is a decreasing function of energy $E$. Since entropy $S(E) = k_{\\mathrm{B}}\\ln \\Omega(E)$, where $\\Omega(E)$ is the number of microstates at energy $E$, $S(E)$ can decrease only if $\\Omega(E)$ decreases with increasing $E$. This is only possible for systems whose energy spectrum is bounded from above.\n\nLet us analyze the given spin system. A single spin has two energy levels: $\\epsilon_{\\uparrow} = -\\mu B$ (for $\\sigma_i=+1$) and $\\epsilon_{\\downarrow} = +\\mu B$ (for $\\sigma_i=-1$).\nFor a system of $N$ such spins, let $n_{\\uparrow}$ be the number of spins in the low-energy state and $n_{\\downarrow}$ be the number in the high-energy state, such that $n_{\\uparrow} + n_{\\downarrow} = N$.\nThe total energy is $E = n_{\\uparrow}(-\\mu B) + n_{\\downarrow}(+\\mu B) = (n_{\\downarrow} - n_{\\uparrow})\\mu B$.\nThe minimum energy is $E_{\\min} = -N\\mu B$ (when $n_{\\downarrow}=0, n_{\\uparrow}=N$).\nThe maximum energy is $E_{\\max} = +N\\mu B$ (when $n_{\\downarrow}=N, n_{\\uparrow}=0$).\nThe energy spectrum is bounded both below and above, which is a necessary condition for negative temperatures to be possible.\n\nThe number of microstates for a given energy $E$ (which corresponds to a specific $n_{\\downarrow}$) is given by the binomial coefficient $\\Omega(E) = \\binom{N}{n_{\\downarrow}}$. The entropy is $S(E) = k_{\\mathrm{B}}\\ln\\binom{N}{n_{\\downarrow}}$.\nThis function is not monotonic. It is zero at the minimum and maximum energies (where $\\Omega=1$), and it reaches a maximum value at $n_{\\downarrow}=N/2$, which corresponds to $E=0$.\nFor energies $E0$, we have $n_{\\downarrow}  n_{\\uparrow}$, which signifies a population inversion. In this regime, the entropy $S(E)$ is a decreasing function of $E$, so its derivative $(\\partial S/\\partial E)$ is negative. Consequently, the temperature $T$ is negative.\n\nIn the canonical ensemble, the probability of a microstate $j$ with energy $E_j$ is $P_j = \\frac{e^{-\\beta E_j}}{Z}$, where $\\beta = 1/(k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)$ is the inverse temperature and $Z = \\sum_j e^{-\\beta E_j}$ is the partition function. For the probability distribution to be normalizable, the partition function $Z$ must be convergent.\n\nWith this foundation, we evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. For a canonical state with inverse temperature $\\beta0$ to be normalizable and thus physically realizable, the energy spectrum of the equilibrated degrees of freedom must be bounded above; if the spectrum is unbounded above, the canonical partition function diverges for $\\beta0$.**\nLet the inverse temperature be negative, $\\beta = -|\\beta|$ where $|\\beta|  0$. The partition function is $Z = \\sum_j e^{-\\beta E_j} = \\sum_j e^{|\\beta| E_j}$. If the energy spectrum $\\{E_j\\}$ is not bounded from above, we can find states with arbitrarily large positive energies. For any $|\\beta|0$, the terms $e^{|\\beta| E_j}$ will grow without limit as $E_j \\to \\infty$. This makes the sum for $Z$ diverge. A divergent partition function implies a non-normalizable probability distribution, which is not physically meaningful. Therefore, for a negative temperature state to be physically realizable within the canonical ensemble, the system's Hamiltonian must have an energy spectrum that is bounded from above. The statement is a correct and fundamental conclusion from the definition of the canonical partition function.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. In the described NMR scenario, if $\\tau_{\\mathrm{ss}}\\ll \\tau_{\\mathrm{sl}}$ and population inversion is prepared, the spin subsystem can be well-described by a canonical distribution with a negative spin temperature, provided it is effectively isolated from the lattice on the timescale of internal equilibration.**\nThe condition $\\tau_{\\mathrm{ss}}\\ll \\tau_{\\mathrm{sl}}$ provides a time window during which the spin subsystem can be treated as an isolated system that has reached internal equilibrium. \"Population inversion\" means that the number of spins in the higher energy state exceeds the number in the lower energy state ($n_{\\downarrow}  n_{\\uparrow}$). As shown in our initial analysis, this corresponds to a total energy $E0$. For the spin system, which has an energy spectrum bounded above, a macrostate with $E0$ corresponds to a negative temperature. Therefore, after the fast internal equilibration ($\\sim \\tau_{\\mathrm{ss}}$) and before significant energy is lost to the lattice ($\\sim \\tau_{\\mathrm{sl}}$), the spin subsystem is correctly described by a canonical distribution with a negative temperature $T_{\\mathrm{spin}}0$. This is the standard and correct description of such prepared states in NMR.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Any arbitrarily weak contact between a negative temperature spin subsystem and a positive temperature reservoir stabilizes the negative temperature, because energy will spontaneously flow from the positive temperature reservoir into the negative temperature subsystem until both attain a common negative temperature.**\nThis statement is incorrect on multiple counts. Negative temperatures are \"hotter\" than all positive temperatures. The complete temperature scale runs from $+0 \\text{ K}$ through positive values to $+\\infty \\text{ K}$, then jumps to $-\\infty \\text{ K}$ and increases through negative values to $-0 \\text{ K}$. Thus, a system at any $T0$ is hotter than a system at any $T0$. According to the second law of thermodynamics, heat flows spontaneously from a hotter body to a colder body. Therefore, energy will flow from the negative temperature spin subsystem to the positive temperature lattice reservoir. This outflow of energy from the spin system causes it to lose its population inversion, and its temperature will change from negative, through infinity, to a positive value, eventually equilibrating at the positive temperature of the reservoir. Contact with a positive temperature reservoir *destabilizes* and ultimately destroys a negative temperature state. The statement makes exactly the opposite claims about the direction of energy flow and stability.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. For the two-level spin ensemble with $H_{\\mathrm{spin}}=-\\mu B\\sum_i \\sigma_i$, the entropy $S(E)$ is strictly increasing in $E$ for all accessible $E$, so $\\left(\\partial S/\\partial E\\right)_{N,V}0$ and negative temperatures cannot occur.**\nAs demonstrated in the initial analysis, the entropy $S(E) = k_{\\mathrm{B}}\\ln\\binom{N}{n_{\\downarrow}}$ for this system is a non-monotonic function of energy $E$. It increases from $E=E_{\\min}$ to a maximum at $E=0$, and then decreases as $E$ increases further to $E=E_{\\max}$. The derivative $(\\partial S/\\partial E)$ is positive for $E0$ (positive temperatures) and negative for $E0$ (negative temperatures). The assertion that $S(E)$ is strictly increasing is factually wrong for this system, which is the canonical example of a system that *can* exhibit negative temperature.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Although a canonical distribution with $\\beta0$ for a given Hamiltonian $H$ can be mapped to a canonical distribution with $\\beta'0$ for the inverted Hamiltonian $H'=-H$ by a change of variables, this mathematical equivalence implies that the sign of temperature has no operational meaning in heat exchange experiments; therefore negative temperature states are physically indistinguishable from positive temperature states of $H'$.**\nThe mathematical equivalence is correct: the occupation probabilities for a system with Hamiltonian $H$ at $\\beta0$ are identical to those for a system with Hamiltonian $H'=-H$ at $\\beta'=-\\beta0$. However, the conclusion drawn from this is deeply flawed. The Hamiltonian $H$ represents the physical energy of the system, a quantity that is fixed by the physics of the interactions. One cannot arbitrarily replace it with $H'=-H$. A system with Hamiltonian $H$ at $T0$ is in a high-energy, population-inverted state. A system with Hamiltonian $H'=-H$ at $T'0$ is in a low-energy state (relative to its ground state $E'_{\\min}$). The operational meaning of temperature is revealed precisely in heat exchange. A system at $T0$ is hotter than any system at $T0$ and will always act as a heat source when brought into contact with one. A system at $T'0$ can be a heat source or a heat sink, depending on whether the temperature of the object it contacts is lower or higher than $T'$. Thus, their thermodynamic behavior is completely different. The states are physically distinguishable.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AB}$$", "id": "2811756"}]}
