This first practice provides a crucial link between quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics by asking you to determine the low-temperature limit of $q_e$ for a multi-electron ion. By applying Hund's rules to find the ground-state term symbol, you will see how the degeneracy of this single state dictates the system's properties when thermal energy is scarce [@problem_id:2010232].", "problem": "Consider a system of gaseous vanadium(III) ions, V$^{3+}$, at thermal equilibrium. The electronic configuration of a V$^{3+}$ ion is [Ar]3d$^2$. For many applications in astrophysics and plasma diagnostics, it is crucial to understand the population of electronic states, which is described by the electronic partition function. In the low-temperature limit, the electronic partition function is dominated by the degeneracy of the ground electronic state.\n\nWhat is the value of the electronic partition function for a single V$^{3+}$ ion in this low-temperature limit?\n\nA. 3\n\nB. 5\n\nC. 7\n\nD. 9\n\nE. 21", "solution": "The problem asks for the electronic partition function, $q_e$, for a gaseous V$^{3+}$ ion in the low-temperature limit. The electronic partition function is generally defined as a sum over all electronic energy levels $i$:\n$$q_e = \\sum_{i} g_i \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_i}{k_B T}\\right)$$\nwhere $g_i$ is the degeneracy of level $i$, $E_i$ is its energy, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature.\n\nIn the low-temperature limit ($T \\to 0$), the exponential term $\\exp(-E_i / k_B T)$ approaches zero for any energy level $E_i$ above the ground state energy $E_0$. Therefore, only the ground state term ($i=0$) contributes to the sum. By convention, we set the ground state energy to zero, $E_0 = 0$. The partition function simplifies to:\n$$q_e(T \\to 0) \\approx g_0 \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_0}{k_B T}\\right) = g_0 \\exp(0) = g_0$$\nThus, we need to find the degeneracy of the ground electronic state, $g_0$. This degeneracy is determined by the total angular momentum quantum number, $J$, of the ground state, via the relation $g_J = 2J+1$. We can find the ground state and its $J$ value by determining the ground-state term symbol using Hund's rules for the given electron configuration, [Ar]3d$^2$.\n\nThe valence electrons are the two electrons in the 3d subshell. For a d-orbital, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=2$. The five d-orbitals correspond to magnetic quantum numbers $m_l = -2, -1, 0, +1, +2$.\n\n**Step 1: Apply Hund's First Rule to maximize the total spin, S.**\nTo maximize $S$, the two electrons must occupy different orbitals with parallel spins.\n$$S = s_1 + s_2 = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = 1$$\nThe spin multiplicity is $2S+1 = 2(1)+1 = 3$.\n\n**Step 2: Apply Hund's Second Rule to maximize the total orbital angular momentum, L, for the given S.**\nTo maximize $L = \\sum m_l$, we place the two electrons in the orbitals with the highest possible $m_l$ values.\n$$L = m_{l1} + m_{l2} = (+2) + (+1) = 3$$\nThe value $L=3$ corresponds to the letter code 'F' for the term symbol (where $L=0, 1, 2, 3, ...$ correspond to S, P, D, F, ...). Combining this with the spin multiplicity, we find the ground-state term is $^3F$.\n\n**Step 3: Apply Hund's Third Rule to find the total angular momentum, J.**\nThe possible values of $J$ are given by the Clebsch-Gordan series: $J = |L-S|, |L-S|+1, \\ldots, L+S$.\nWith $L=3$ and $S=1$, the possible $J$ values are:\n$$J = |3-1|, |3-1|+1, \\ldots, 3+1 \\implies J = 2, 3, 4$$\nThese $J$ values correspond to the fine-structure levels of the $^3F$ term. For a subshell that is less than half-full (a 3d subshell has 2 electrons, which is less than the half-filled capacity of 5), the ground level is the one with the minimum value of $J$. In this case, the minimum $J$ is 2.\nTherefore, the ground-state term symbol, including the $J$ level, is $^3F_2$.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the degeneracy of the ground state.**\nThe degeneracy of the ground state, $g_0$, is given by $2J+1$, where $J$ is the total angular momentum quantum number of the ground level.\nFor the $^3F_2$ level, $J=2$.\n$$g_0 = 2J+1 = 2(2)+1 = 5$$\n\n**Step 5: Determine the low-temperature partition function.**\nAs established earlier, $q_e(T \\to 0) = g_0$.\n$$q_e = 5$$\nThe other options correspond to common misinterpretations:\n- A. 3 is the spin multiplicity, $2S+1$.\n- C. 7 is the orbital degeneracy, $2L+1$.\n- D. 9 is the degeneracy of the highest $J$ level ($J=4$), $2(4)+1=9$.\n- E. 21 is the total degeneracy of the entire $^3F$ term, $(2S+1)(2L+1) = 3 \\times 7 = 21$.\n\nThe correct answer is 5.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2010232"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the ground-state concept, we now consider systems where thermal energy is sufficient to populate low-lying excited states.
