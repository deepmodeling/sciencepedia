This model can fail for important large-amplitude motions, such as the internal rotation around a chemical bond. This practice challenges you to reason from first principles about the limitations of the Cartesian normal mode picture and explore the more sophisticated framework of curvilinear internal coordinates, a key concept for accurately modeling flexible molecules and their dynamics [@problem_id:2829305].", "problem": "Consider a non-linear molecule with $N$ atoms moving on a single Born–Oppenheimer (BO) potential energy surface. The nuclear dynamics can be formulated from classical mechanics via a Lagrangian $L = T - V$, where $T$ is the kinetic energy and $V$ is the potential energy. Near a stable equilibrium geometry, $V$ can be expanded in a Taylor series in small displacements from equilibrium and truncated at quadratic order. In this regime, normal mode analysis in mass-weighted Cartesian coordinates gives vibrational frequencies and normal modes that are orthogonal under the kinetic energy metric. \n\nNow consider a large-amplitude internal motion, such as a low-barrier internal rotation (torsion) about a single bond that substantially changes a dihedral angle, while other bond lengths and bond angles remain close to their equilibrium values. You are asked to reason from first principles why the standard Cartesian normal mode description can fail to represent such large-amplitude motions and to characterize a more suitable coordinate choice.\n\nStarting from the above base (classical Lagrangian mechanics, BO separation, quadratic expansion of the potential near equilibrium, and coordinate transformations), select all statements that are correct about the failure of Cartesian normal modes for large-amplitude internal motions and the nature of curvilinear internal coordinates that better describe such motions.\n\nA. For large-amplitude torsions, the mapping from a dihedral angle change to Cartesian displacements is nonlinear in the Cartesian coordinates and lives on a curved constraint manifold. As a consequence, a finite torsional displacement cannot be represented by a single fixed linear combination of mass-weighted Cartesian normal modes obtained at equilibrium, and spurious mixing with overall rotations and translations can occur away from equilibrium, even if Eckart conditions are imposed at the reference geometry.\n\nB. Curvilinear internal coordinates can be defined as differentiable functions of the Cartesian coordinates, for example bond lengths, bond angles, and dihedral angles. In these coordinates the kinetic energy takes the form of a quadratic form with a coordinate-dependent metric (a positive-definite tensor on the internal coordinate manifold), which ensures that finite displacements along a torsional coordinate remain tangent to the internal manifold and reduces spurious coupling to overall rotations for large-amplitude motions.\n\nC. The breakdown of Cartesian normal modes for large-amplitude motions occurs because the harmonic potential becomes exactly periodic in the displacement, making the eigenvalue problem ill-defined. Switching to curvilinear internal coordinates fixes this by forcing the potential to be strictly quadratic globally, restoring a unique set of normal modes valid for all amplitudes.\n\nD. Curvilinear internal coordinates are unsuitable for vibrational analysis because they cannot be made orthonormal; only Cartesian coordinates preserve orthogonality of modes and energy conservation. Therefore, any coordinate dependence of the kinetic energy metric violates the conservation of total energy.\n\nE. If certain high-frequency coordinates (such as bond lengths) are constrained to their equilibrium values, the number of vibrational degrees of freedom reduces to $3N-6$ for a non-linear molecule, which can be parameterized by curvilinear internal coordinates like bond angles and dihedral angles. In this reduced space the equations of motion involve a coordinate-dependent kinetic energy metric, naturally leading to a generalized eigenvalue problem for small-amplitude vibrations around each geometry and providing a better local representation of large-amplitude deformations such as torsions.\n\nSelect all that apply.", "solution": "We begin from classical mechanics for nuclei on a single Born–Oppenheimer potential energy surface.

This construction is valid for small-amplitude motions around $\\mathbf{r}^{(0)}$, where the truncated expansion is accurate and the kinetic energy metric is Euclidean in $\\mathbf{q}$.\n\nFor large-amplitude internal motions such as torsions, the relevant physical displacement corresponds to a finite change in a dihedral angle. The mapping from internal coordinates (bond lengths, bond angles, dihedral angles) to Cartesian coordinates is nonlinear. Even if most internal coordinates remain close to equilibrium, a finite change in a dihedral produces Cartesian displacements that follow a curved path on the constraint manifold defined by approximately fixed bond lengths and angles. Consequently, a single linear subspace spanned by equilibrium normal modes cannot globally represent this curved trajectory. Moreover, while the Eckart conditions can be used to decouple overall rotations and translations at $\\mathbf{r}^{(0)}$, away from that geometry the projections change, and spurious mixing can reappear for finite displacements because the tangent space rotates along the path.\n\nCurvilinear internal coordinates address these issues by parameterizing the physically constrained manifold with coordinates $\\mathbf{s}=(s_1,\\dots,s_f)$ constructed as differentiable functions of $\\mathbf{r}$, such as bond lengths $r_{ab}$, bond angles $\\theta_{abc}$, and dihedral angles $\\phi_{abcd}$.

Finite displacements along a single internal coordinate stay within this manifold, and the coordinate dependence of the metric accounts for the curvature of the mapping to Cartesians. Energy conservation follows from time-translation invariance of $L$ and does not require orthonormal coordinates; generalized coordinates with a coordinate-dependent metric are standard in analytical mechanics. Around any specific geometry $\\mathbf{s}^{(0)}$, one can linearize to obtain a local harmonic description, which in internal coordinates leads to a generalized eigenvalue problem with the metric $g_{ij}(\\mathbf{s}^{(0)})$ and the Hessian of $V$ in the internal coordinates. When some stiff coordinates are constrained (e.g., bond lengths), the number of vibrational degrees of freedom for a non-linear molecule is $3N-6$, and a set of curvilinear internal coordinates can be chosen to parameterize these.\n\nWe now analyze each option:\n\nA. This statement correctly identifies the geometric reason for failure. A finite torsional change corresponds to a curve on the manifold of allowed Cartesian configurations with nearly fixed bond lengths and angles. The mapping from the dihedral to Cartesians is nonlinear, so a single fixed linear combination of equilibrium normal modes in mass-weighted Cartesians cannot globally capture this motion. The mention of spurious mixing with overall rotations and translations away from equilibrium is also accurate: the Eckart conditions are enforced at a reference geometry, but for finite displacements the best-fit rotation changes, and the decoupling is only local. Verdict: Correct.\n\nB. This statement correctly defines curvilinear internal coordinates as differentiable functions of Cartesian coordinates, with examples. It correctly states that the kinetic energy becomes a quadratic form with a coordinate-dependent metric $g_{ij}(\\mathbf{s})$, derived from the Jacobian of the transformation weighted by masses. This metric guarantees that finite displacements along an internal coordinate are represented as tangent vectors on the internal manifold, which mitigates spurious coupling to overall rotations for large-amplitude motions. Verdict: Correct.\n\nC. This statement is incorrect on two counts. First, the harmonic potential does not become exactly periodic; rather, the harmonic approximation ceases to be valid globally for large amplitudes, and true periodicity in a torsion arises from the full potential energy surface, not from the harmonic expansion. Second, curvilinear internal coordinates do not force the potential to be quadratic globally; they provide a more natural parameterization, but the potential remains whatever function it is of the internal coordinates. Therefore, there is no restoration of a single global set of normal modes valid for all amplitudes. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. This statement is incorrect. Orthogonality of coordinates is not required for energy conservation. Generalized coordinates with a coordinate-dependent metric are standard in Lagrangian mechanics; the total energy is conserved if the Lagrangian has no explicit time dependence. While curvilinear coordinates generally do not yield orthonormal bases, the kinetic energy metric $g_{ij}(\\mathbf{s})$ correctly accounts for the coordinate geometry, and vibrational analysis proceeds via a generalized eigenvalue problem. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nE. This statement correctly notes that after removing overall translations and rotations, a non-linear molecule has $3N-6$ vibrational degrees of freedom. If some stiff coordinates (e.g., bond lengths) are constrained, the remaining degrees can be parameterized by curvilinear internal coordinates such as bond angles and dihedrals. In this reduced space, the kinetic energy metric is coordinate dependent, and the local small-amplitude analysis leads to a generalized eigenvalue problem at each geometry. This local analysis provides better representations of large-amplitude deformations by adapting to the local geometry along the path.

A first-order saddle point, or transition state, has precisely one negative eigenvalue.\n\nThe finding of a single imaginary frequency of $\\mathrm{i}\\,18\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ for a $10$-atom molecule suggests two possibilities: either the structure is a true first-order saddle point with a very low activation barrier, or it is an artifact of numerical error in the calculation. The small magnitude of the frequency is a strong indicator that numerical precision may be the culprit. A proper diagnostic procedure must rigorously test the numerical stability and physical reality of this feature of the potential energy surface. We will now evaluate each proposed check.\n\nA. Tighten Self-Consistent Field (SCF) and geometry convergence thresholds and recompute the analytic Hessian; disappearance of the imaginary frequency under tighter thresholds supports a numerical artifact explanation.\nThis is a standard and essential diagnostic procedure. The problem notes that optimization was performed to *default* thresholds. These defaults are often insufficient for potential energy surfaces that are very flat, a condition often associated with small imaginary frequencies. If the nuclear gradient is not converged to a very small value, the geometry is not a true stationary point, and the second derivatives (the Hessian) computed at that point are not physically meaningful for characterizing a minimum or a saddle point. Insufficient SCF convergence can also lead to errors in the forces and the Hessian. By tightening all relevant convergence criteria (for example, reducing the maximum force component tolerance by one or two orders of magnitude) and re-optimizing, one can obtain a geometry that is much closer to the true stationary point. If the imaginary frequency disappears upon re-evaluation at this more tightly converged geometry, it is strong evidence that the initial result was a numerical artifact arising from incomplete optimization.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nB. Repeat the frequency calculation with a larger basis set and, for DFT, a denser numerical integration grid; if the sign and magnitude of the suspect eigenvalue are stable under these changes, it is more likely to be physical, whereas sensitivity indicates numerical or basis-set origin.\nThis is another fundamental test of the robustness of a computational result. Quantum chemical calculations are subject to controllable errors. For DFT, the primary sources are the incompleteness of the atomic orbital basis set and the finite density of the numerical grid used to evaluate the exchange-correlation integrals. A small, spurious imaginary frequency is often an indication that the chosen basis set is not flexible enough to describe the potential energy surface curvature correctly, or that the integration grid is too coarse, introducing numerical noise into the second derivatives. A principled approach is to check for convergence with respect to these parameters. If the imaginary frequency persists and its magnitude stabilizes upon using a larger basis set and a denser grid, it is more likely a genuine feature of the PES at the given level of theory. Conversely, if it vanishes or fluctuates wildly, it is almost certainly a numerical artifact.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nC. Recompute the Hessian via finite differences of analytic gradients using at least two different displacement step sizes; if the imaginary frequency’s magnitude and even its sign depend strongly on the step size, this suggests truncation or round-off error.\nThis is a valid method for diagnosing numerical instability. While the original calculation used an analytic Hessian, re-calculating it with an independent method—numerical finite differences—provides a valuable cross-check. Finite-difference calculations of the Hessian are sensitive to the chosen atomic displacement step size. A step size that is too large leads to significant truncation error from the finite difference formula, while a step size that is too small amplifies round-off error from machine precision. For a well-behaved system, there should be a plateau where the computed eigenvalues are stable with respect to the step size. If the eigenvalue corresponding to the imaginary frequency is highly sensitive to the step size, changing sign or magnitude erratically, it indicates that the calculation of the curvature in that direction is numerically unstable. This instability is a hallmark of a numerical artifact rather than a well-defined physical feature.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nD. Uniformly scale all computed harmonic frequencies by an empirical factor (for example, multiply by $0.96$) so that a small imaginary value becomes positive; if the scaled frequency is a positive, the structure can be treated as a minimum.\nThis proposal is fundamentally flawed and unscientific. Empirical scaling factors, typically with values slightly less than $1$ (e.g., $0.96$), are used to correct the *quantitative* overestimation of *real, positive* vibrational frequencies by harmonic models, aiming to improve agreement with experimental anharmonic frequencies. They are not designed to alter the *qualitative* nature of a stationary point. An imaginary frequency $\\tilde{\\nu} = \\mathrm{i}|\\tilde{\\nu}|$ corresponds to a negative Hessian eigenvalue, signifying a potential energy maximum. Multiplying by a real, positive scaling factor $s$ results in $s \\times (\\mathrm{i}|\\tilde{\\nu}|) = \\mathrm{i}(s|\\tilde{\\nu}|)$, which is still an imaginary number. This operation cannot change a negative curvature into a positive one. To suggest that such a mathematical sleight of hand can convert a saddle point into a minimum is a gross misunderstanding of the underlying physics and is not a valid procedure.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nE. Displace the geometry by a small amount along the eigenvector of the imaginary mode in both directions (for example, by $\\pm 0.05\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$ in mass-weighted coordinates), reoptimize from each displaced geometry with tight thresholds, and recompute frequencies; if both optimizations return to the original structure and the imaginary mode disappears, the original imaginary frequency was likely spurious.\nThis is the most definitive diagnostic test. The eigenvector of an imaginary mode points along the path of steepest descent from a saddle point. If the stationary point is a true first-order saddle point, displacing the structure along this vector in the positive and negative directions and re-optimizing will lead to two different minima (the reactant and product). If, however, the imaginary frequency is a numerical artifact on a very flat potential minimum, the structure is already sitting in a potential well. In this case, small displacements followed by re-optimization should lead back to the original geometry from both directions. If this occurs, and subsequent frequency analysis (preferably with tighter criteria) shows no imaginary frequencies, it confirms that the original stationary point was indeed a minimum and the imaginary frequency was spurious.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nF. Verify that the six overall translation and rotation modes are properly projected out; incomplete projection or numerical leakage of these zero modes into the vibrational subspace can generate small-magnitude imaginary values.\nThis is a critical sanity check. For any non-linear molecule, the $3N$ Cartesian degrees of freedom include $3$ translations and $3$ rotations of the molecule as a whole. The potential energy is invariant to these motions, so their corresponding modes must have frequencies of zero. In numerical calculations, these six modes will have eigenvalues that are very close to zero, but may be slightly positive or negative due to numerical noise. A robust frequency calculation must correctly identify and project these modes out of the vibrational analysis. If this projection is imperfect, a small negative eigenvalue from the rotational/translational block of the Hessian can be misassigned as a vibrational mode, appearing as a small imaginary frequency. The value of $\\mathrm{i}\\,18\\,\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ is small enough to be a candidate for such an artifact. Therefore, inspecting the frequencies and eigenvectors of the modes near zero to ensure they correspond to pure translations and rotations is a necessary step.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\nG. Introduce electronic smearing (finite electronic temperature) in the SCF to smooth the potential energy surface near the Fermi level; if the imaginary mode disappears, it was numerical noise rather than a true saddle point.\nThis procedure is inappropriate as a diagnostic tool. Electronic smearing is a numerical technique to aid SCF convergence, particularly in systems with near-degenerate frontier orbitals (e.g., metals), by introducing a fictitious electronic temperature and fractional occupations. This alters the underlying physics; the calculation no longer minimizes the electronic energy $E$ but rather a free energy functional $A = E - TS_{el}$. While smearing might \"smooth out\" the potential energy surface and coincidentally remove the imaginary frequency, this does not diagnose the original problem. It changes the physical model. One cannot conclude that the imaginary frequency in the original $T=0\\,\\mathrm{K}$ calculation was numerical noise simply because it disappeared in a calculation at a finite electronic temperature. This approach obfuscates the issue rather than clarifying it. Principled diagnosis requires addressing the numerical fidelity of the original, intended calculation.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABCEF}$$", "id": "2829357"}]}
