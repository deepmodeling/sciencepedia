This is the case of primary interest in the study of DFT functional errors. Thus, we assume the condition above is met.\n\n    Under this assumption, the equilibrium distribution is:\n    $$\n    q_A^{\\ast}(w) = \\frac{w}{2}, \\quad q_B^{\\ast}(w) = \\frac{w}{2}\n    $$\n    The minimized energy is:\n    $$\n    E_{\\mathrm{LDA}}^{\\ast}(w) = E_{\\mathrm{LDA}}(w/2) = \\frac{J}{2}w^2 - 2^{-1/3} A w^{4/3}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Generalized Gradient Approximation (PBE)**\n    The energy expression is analogous to LDA, with the exchange constant $A$ replaced by $\\Lambda A$:\n    $$\n    E_{\\mathrm{PBE}}(q_A) = J(q_A^2 + (w-q_A)^2) - \\Lambda A(q_A^{4/3} + (w-q_A)^{4/3})\n    $$\n    The mathematical analysis is identical. Imposing the same assumption that the delocalized solution is the minimum, we find the same equilibrium distribution:\n    $$\n    q_A^{\\ast}(w) = \\frac{w}{2}, \\quad q_B^{\\ast}(w) = \\frac{w}{2}\n    $$\n    The minimized energy is found by substituting this distribution into the energy expression:\n    $$\n    E_{\\mathrm{PBE}}^{\\ast}(w) = E_{\\mathrm{PBE}}(w/2) = \\frac{J}{2}w^2 - 2^{-1/3} \\Lambda A w^{4/3}\n    $$\n\n3.  **Hybrid Functional**\n    The energy for the hybrid functional is given as:\n    $$\n    E^{\\mathrm{hyb}} = E_{H} + a\\,E_{x}^{\\mathrm{HF}} + (1-a)\\,E_{x}^{\\mathrm{PBE}}\n    $$\n    Using the provided identities $E_{H} + a E_{x}^{\\mathrm{HF}} = (1-a)J(q_{A}^{2}+q_{B}^{2})$ and $E_{x}^{\\mathrm{PBE}} = -\\Lambda A (q_{A}^{4/3} + q_{B}^{4/3})$, we get:\n    $$\n    E^{\\mathrm{hyb}}(q_A, q_B) = (1-a)J(q_A^2 + q_B^2) - (1-a)\\Lambda A(q_A^{4/3} + q_B^{4/3})\n    $$\n    $$\n    E^{\\mathrm{hyb}}(q_A, q_B) = (1-a) \\left[ J(q_A^2 + q_B^2) - \\Lambda A(q_A^{4/3} + q_B^{4/3}) \\right] = (1-a) E_{\\mathrm{PBE}}(q_A, q_B)\n    $$\n    Since $a \\in [0,1]$, the factor $(1-a)$ is non-negative. Therefore, minimizing $E^{\\mathrm{hyb}}$ is equivalent to minimizing $E_{\\mathrm{PBE}}$ (for $a1$). For $a=1$, the energy is zero and any distribution is a minimum. Assuming $a1$, the equilibrium distribution is the same as for PBE:\n    $$\n    q_A^{\\ast}(w) = \\frac{w}{2}, \\quad q_B^{\\ast}(w) = \\frac{w}{2}\n    $$\n    The minimized hybrid energy is then $(1-a)$ times the minimized PBE energy:\n    $$\n    E_{\\mathrm{hyb}}^{\\ast}(w) = (1-a) E_{\\mathrm{PBE}}^{\\ast}(w) = (1-a) \\left( \\frac{J}{2}w^2 - 2^{-1/3} \\Lambda A w^{4/3} \\right)\n    $$\n\nCombining these results gives the final expressions for the equilibrium distribution and the corresponding minimized energies.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{w}{2}  \\frac{w}{2}  \\frac{J}{2}w^2 - 2^{-1/3} A w^{4/3}  \\frac{J}{2}w^2 - 2^{-1/3} \\Lambda A w^{4/3}  (1-a) \\left( \\frac{J}{2}w^2 - 2^{-1/3} \\Lambda A w^{4/3} \\right) \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2772971"}]}
