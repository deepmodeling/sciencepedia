First, a theoretical derivation relating the enthalpy difference between cis- and trans-$2$-butene to their respective heats of hydrogenation. Second, a calculation of this enthalpy difference using the provided calorimetric data.\n\nWe begin with the fundamental thermodynamic principles. The objective is to determine the \"steric penalty\" of the cis isomer, which is explicitly defined as $\\Delta H_{\\text{cis}\\rightarrow\\text{trans}} \\equiv H_{\\text{cis}} - H_{\\text{trans}}$, where $H_{\\text{cis}}$ and $H_{\\text{trans}}$ are the molar standard enthalpies of formation of cis-$2$-butene and trans-$2$-butene, respectively, at the specified conditions ($298\\ \\mathrm{K}$, $1\\ \\mathrm{bar}$).\n\nLet us define the catalytic hydrogenation reactions for the two isomers:\nReaction $1$: cis-$2$-butene(solv) + H$_2$(g) $\\rightarrow$ butane(solv)\nThe molar enthalpy change for this reaction is the molar heat of hydrogenation of the cis isomer, $\\Delta H_{\\text{hydro, cis}}$.\n\nReaction $2$: trans-$2$-butene(solv) + H$_2$(g) $\\rightarrow$ butane(solv)\nThe molar enthalpy change for this reaction is the molar heat of hydrogenation of the trans isomer, $\\Delta H_{\\text{hydro, trans}}$.\n\nUsing the definition of enthalpy of reaction, we can express these quantities in terms of the molar enthalpies of the species involved. Let $H_{\\text{cis}}$, $H_{\\text{trans}}$, $H_{\\text{H}_2}$, and $H_{\\text{butane}}$ be the molar enthalpies of cis-$2$-butene, trans-$2$-butene, hydrogen, and butane, respectively, under the experimental conditions.\n\nFor Reaction $1$:\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\text{hydro, cis}} = H_{\\text{butane}} - (H_{\\text{cis}} + H_{\\text{H}_2}) $$\n\nFor Reaction $2$:\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\text{hydro, trans}} = H_{\\text{butane}} - (H_{\\text{trans}} + H_{\\text{H}_2}) $$\n\nTo find the desired quantity, $H_{\\text{cis}} - H_{\\text{trans}}$, we can manipulate these two equations. Subtracting the second equation from the first is not the direct path. Instead, we seek an expression for $H_{\\text{cis}} - H_{\\text{trans}}$. Let us rearrange the above equations to isolate the isomer enthalpies:\n$$ H_{\\text{cis}} = H_{\\text{butane}} - H_{\\text{H}_2} - \\Delta H_{\\text{hydro, cis}} $$\n$$ H_{\\text{trans}} = H_{\\text{butane}} - H_{\\text{H}_2} - \\Delta H_{\\text{hydro, trans}} $$\n\nNow, subtracting the expression for $H_{\\text{trans}}$ from the expression for $H_{\\text{cis}}$:\n$$ H_{\\text{cis}} - H_{\\text{trans}} = (H_{\\text{butane}} - H_{\\text{H}_2} - \\Delta H_{\\text{hydro, cis}}) - (H_{\\text{butane}} - H_{\\text{H}_2} - \\Delta H_{\\text{hydro, trans}}) $$\n$$ H_{\\text{cis}} - H_{\\text{trans}} = -\\Delta H_{\\text{hydro, cis}} + \\Delta H_{\\text{hydro, trans}} $$\n$$ H_{\\text{cis}} - H_{\\text{trans}} = \\Delta H_{\\text{hydro, trans}} - \\Delta H_{\\text{hydro, cis}} $$\nThis derived expression relates the enthalpy difference between the isomers to the difference in their heats of hydrogenation. This completes the first part of the problem. This result is consistent with Hess’s law applied to the cycle involving the two hydrogenation reactions and the isomerization reaction cis-$2$-butene $\\rightarrow$ trans-$2$-butene.\n\nNext, we must relate these molar heats of hydrogenation to the experimental calorimetric data. The experiment is conducted at constant pressure in a well-insulated calorimeter. The assumption that all heat released by the reaction is absorbed by the calorimetric assembly leads to the relation:\n$$ q_{\\text{rxn}} + q_{\\text{cal}} = 0 $$\nwhere $q_{\\text{rxn}}$ is the heat generated by the reaction and $q_{\\text{cal}}$ is the heat absorbed by the calorimeter. At constant pressure, the heat generated by the reaction is equal to the total enthalpy change for the reaction, $\\Delta H_{\\text{rxn}}$. So, $q_{\\text{rxn}} = \\Delta H_{\\text{rxn}}$.\nThe heat absorbed by the calorimeter is given by:\n$$ q_{\\text{cal}} = C_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\Delta T $$\nTherefore, the total enthalpy change for the reaction of $n$ moles of alkene is:\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\text{rxn}} = -q_{\\text{cal}} = -C_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\Delta T $$\nThe molar heat of hydrogenation, $\\Delta H_{\\text{hydro}}$, is the enthalpy change per mole of alkene:\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\text{hydro}} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{rxn}}}{n} = -\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\Delta T}{n} $$\n\nApplying this general formula to our two specific runs:\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\text{hydro, cis}} = -\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\Delta T_{\\text{cis}}}{n} $$\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\text{hydro, trans}} = -\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\Delta T_{\\text{trans}}}{n} $$\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions back into our derived equation for the steric penalty:\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\text{cis}\\rightarrow\\text{trans}} = H_{\\text{cis}} - H_{\\text{trans}} = \\left(-\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\Delta T_{\\text{trans}}}{n}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\Delta T_{\\text{cis}}}{n}\\right) $$\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\text{cis}\\rightarrow\\text{trans}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{n} (\\Delta T_{\\text{cis}} - \\Delta T_{\\text{trans}}) $$\nThis is the final expression to be used for calculation. Cis isomers are typically less stable than their trans counterparts due to steric repulsion between substituents, meaning $H_{\\text{cis}} > H_{\\text{trans}}$. This implies that hydrogenation of the cis isomer should release more heat, leading to a larger temperature increase ($\\Delta T_{\\text{cis}} > \\Delta T_{\\text{trans}}$). The experimental data, $\\Delta T_{\\text{cis}} = 0.7960\\ \\mathrm{K}$ and $\\Delta T_{\\text{trans}} = 0.7680\\ \\mathrm{K}$, are consistent with this chemical principle.

It describes a well-known chemical system, cyclooctatetraene, and asks for an explanation of its properties using standard and appropriate chemical theories (HMO theory, Jahn-Teller theorem). The premises are factually correct, and the question is a standard conceptual problem in physical organic chemistry. The problem is therefore valid. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe solution requires a step-by-step application of the provided theoretical tools.\n\n**Step 1: Application of Hückel Molecular Orbital (HMO) Theory**\nWe begin by considering a hypothetical planar, regular, octagonal cyclooctatetraene molecule, which would possess $D_{8h}$ symmetry. According to HMO theory, the energies of the $\\pi$ molecular orbitals for a regular $N$-annulene are given by the formula:\n$$ E_k = \\alpha + 2\\beta \\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi k}{N}\\right) $$\nFor cyclooctatetraene, $N=8$. The quantum number $k$ takes integer values $k = 0, \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\dots, N/2$. Here, $k = 0, \\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, 4$.\nThe energy levels are:\n- $k=0$: $E_0 = \\alpha + 2\\beta$ (one orbital, bonding)\n- $k=\\pm 1$: $E_{\\pm 1} = \\alpha + \\sqrt{2}\\beta$ (degenerate pair, bonding)\n- $k=\\pm 2$: $E_{\\pm 2} = \\alpha$ (degenerate pair, **non-bonding**)\n- $k=\\pm 3$: $E_{\\pm 3} = \\alpha - \\sqrt{2}\\beta$ (degenerate pair, anti-bonding)\n- $k=4$: $E_{4} = \\alpha - 2\\beta$ (one orbital, anti-bonding)\n\nCyclooctatetraene has $8$ $\\pi$ electrons. We fill these orbitals according to the Aufbau principle and Hund's rule:\n- $2$ electrons fill the $E_0$ orbital.\n- $4$ electrons fill the degenerate $E_{\\pm 1}$ orbitals.\n- The remaining $8 - (2+4) = 2$ electrons must be placed in the next available orbitals, which are the degenerate non-bonding molecular orbitals (NBMOs) at energy $E_{\\pm 2} = \\alpha$.\nFollowing Hund's rule, these two electrons will occupy the two degenerate orbitals singly, with parallel spins. This results in an open-shell, triplet ground state. An electronic state where the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) are degenerate and partially filled is, by definition, an electronically degenerate state.\n\n**Step 2: Analysis of Aromaticity**\nHückel's rule for aromaticity states that a planar, cyclic, fully conjugated system is aromatic if it has $(4n+2)$ $\\pi$ electrons, where $n$ is an integer. Systems with $4n$ $\\pi$ electrons are antiaromatic. Cyclooctatetraene has $8$ $\\pi$ electrons, which fits the $4n$ rule for $n=2$. Therefore, a hypothetical planar cyclooctatetraene is predicted to be antiaromatic, which is associated with significant electronic destabilization and a paramagnetic (diradical-like) character, consistent with the open-shell configuration derived from HMO theory.\n\n**Step 3: Application of the Jahn-Teller Theorem**\nThe Jahn-Teller theorem states that any non-linear molecule in an electronically degenerate ground state is unstable and will undergo a geometric distortion to lower its symmetry, thereby removing the degeneracy and lowering the total energy.\nOur HMO analysis of planar cyclooctatetraene predicted an electronically degenerate ground state. Therefore, according to the Jahn-Teller theorem, this high-symmetry ($D_{8h}$) planar structure must distort. There are two primary modes of distortion:\n1. An in-plane distortion (a Peierls distortion) involving bond-length alternation, lowering the symmetry to $D_{4h}$ (a rectangle with alternating short and long bonds). This splits the degenerate NBMOs, but the molecule remains planar and antiaromatic, albeit to a lesser extent.\n2. An out-of-plane distortion, or puckering, which lowers the symmetry to $D_{2d}$ (the experimentally observed \"tub\" conformation).\n\nThe out-of-plane distortion is more effective at stabilizing the molecule. By adopting the tub shape, the planarity of the ring is lost. This severely reduces the overlap between adjacent $p$ orbitals, effectively breaking the cyclic conjugation. The system no longer functions as a single delocalized $\\pi$ system but rather as a cyclic polyene with four localized and largely independent double bonds. This structural change accomplishes two things: it removes the electronic degeneracy, leading to a closed-shell singlet ground state, and it circumvents the severe electronic destabilization associated with antiaromaticity. The resulting molecule is nonaromatic, which is much more stable than being antiaromatic.\n\nNow we evaluate the given options based on this analysis.\n\n**A. In a hypothetical planar, regular $[8]$annulene with $D_{8h}$ symmetry, the Hückel $\\pi$ spectrum places the Fermi level at a pair of symmetry-degenerate nonbonding molecular orbitals. With $8$ $\\pi$ electrons, this produces an electronically degenerate ground state. By the Jahn–Teller theorem, the molecule undergoes an out-of-plane symmetry-lowering distortion (to a tub-like geometry) that splits this degeneracy, allows the two electrons to pair in the stabilized orbital, and reduces cyclic $p$-orbital overlap. The result is a closed-shell, nonplanar structure with localized double bonds that does not sustain a global ring current, i.e., it is nonaromatic rather than antiaromatic.**\nThis statement accurately follows the line of reasoning derived above. It correctly identifies the degenerate NBMOs from HMO theory, the resulting degenerate electronic state, the application of the Jahn-Teller theorem leading to an out-of-plane distortion, and the final outcome of a nonplanar, nonaromatic molecule that avoids antiaromaticity. The description is complete and correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Cyclooctatetraene is nonplanar because two ring carbons are $sp^3$-hybridized, interrupting conjugation; nevertheless, the ring remains aromatic by adopting a Möbius topology that preserves cyclic delocalization in the nonplanar conformation.**\nThis statement is incorrect. All carbon atoms in cyclooctatetraene are $sp^2$-hybridized, forming three $\\sigma$ bonds in a trigonal planar arrangement locally. The nonplanarity of the ring arises from twisting around the C-C $\\sigma$ bonds. The molecule does not contain any $sp^3$-hybridized carbons. Furthermore, the ground state of cyclooctatetraene is nonaromatic, not Möbius aromatic.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Cyclooctatetraene is planar and antiaromatic by Hückel’s $4n$ rule in its electronic ground state; the observed nonplanarity is caused only by steric repulsion between hydrogen atoms, which does not affect its aromatic character.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The ground state of cyclooctatetraene is nonplanar. The planar form is a high-energy transition state for ring inversion. While ring strain and steric repulsion contribute to the instability of the planar form, the primary driving force for distortion is electronic (avoidance of antiaromaticity, explained by the Jahn-Teller effect). The nonplanarity fundamentally alters the electronic character from antiaromatic to nonaromatic by breaking conjugation.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Cyclooctatetraene minimizes antiaromaticity by undergoing a bond-length alternation (a Peierls-type distortion) while remaining planar; this creates benzene-like aromatic sextets within the ring and thus restores Hückel aromaticity despite having $8$ $\\pi$ electrons.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The molecule does not remain planar in its ground state; it puckers into a tub shape. The concept of \"benzene-like aromatic sextets\" is not applicable here and is chemically nonsensical in this context. A system with $8$ $\\pi$ electrons cannot achieve Hückel aromaticity, which requires $(4n+2)$ electrons.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. A planar $[8]$annulene with $8$ $\\pi$ electrons would be Hückel aromatic; cyclooctatetraene distorts to a square planar arrangement to maximize delocalization and aromatic stabilization, hence its nonplanarity accompanies increased aromaticity.**\nThis statement is incorrect on multiple points. A system with $8$ $\\pi$ electrons is Hückel antiaromatic, not aromatic. The molecule distorts to a tub shape, not a square planar arrangement. The distortion minimizes delocalization to avoid antiaromatic destabilization, it does not maximize it. Consequently, nonplanarity leads to nonaromaticity, not increased aromaticity.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nBased on the thorough analysis, option A is the only one that provides a scientifically rigorous and complete explanation consistent with the provided theoretical framework.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2948734"}]}
