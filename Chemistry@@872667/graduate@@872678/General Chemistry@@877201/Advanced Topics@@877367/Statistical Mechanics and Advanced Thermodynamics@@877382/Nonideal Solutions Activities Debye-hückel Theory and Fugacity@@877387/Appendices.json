The specified model employs the dimensionless excess Gibbs free energy, $g^E(T,x) \\equiv G^E(T,x)/(RT)$, where $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is absolute temperature, and $x \\equiv x_1$ is the mole fraction of component $1$. The Redlich-Kister expansion for $g^E$ is given as:\n$$g^{E}(T,x) = x(1-x)\\left[A_0(T) + A_1(T)\\,(2x - 1)\\right]$$\nThe temperature dependence is explicitly captured in the coefficients $A_k(T)$:\n$$A_k(T) = a_k + \\frac{b_k}{T} + c_k\\,T, \\quad k\\in\\{0,1\\}$$\nThe activity coefficients $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$ are derived from $g^E$ using the partial molar property relations:\n$$\\ln \\gamma_1 = g^{E} + (1-x)\\frac{\\partial g^{E}}{\\partial x}$$\n$$\\ln \\gamma_2 = g^{E} - x\\frac{\\partial g^{E}}{\\partial x}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $g^E$ and performing the differentiation yields the explicit expressions for the logarithm of the activity coefficients:\n$$\\ln \\gamma_1(T,x;\\theta) = (1-x)^2 \\left[A_0(T) + A_1(T)(4x-1)\\right]$$\n$$\\ln \\gamma_2(T,x;\\theta) = x^2 \\left[A_0(T) + A_1(T)(4x-3)\\right]$$\n\nThese expressions connect the model parameters $\\theta$ to the phase equilibrium conditions. For VLE, the condition of equal fugacity for each component in the liquid ($L$) and vapor ($V$) phases, $f_i^L = f_i^V$, combined with the definition of liquid phase activity ($f_i^L = x_i \\gamma_i f_i^{\\circ}$) and the assumption of an ideal gas vapor phase ($f_i^V = y_i P \\approx x_i \\gamma_i P_i^{\\text{sat}}(T)$), leads to the bubble-point pressure equation:\n$$P_{\\text{bub}}(T,x;\\theta) = x\\,\\gamma_1(T,x;\\theta)\\,P_1^{\\text{sat}}(T) + (1-x)\\,\\gamma_2(T,x;\\theta)\\,P_2^{\\text{sat}}(T)$$\nThe deviation from measured bubble pressures $P_{\\text{meas}}$ is quantified by the VLE residual, $r_{\\text{VLE}}$, defined as:\n$$r_{\\text{VLE}} = \\frac{P_{\\text{bub}}(T,x;\\theta) - P_{\\text{meas}}(T,x)}{P_{\\text{scale}}}$$\nwhere $P_{\\text{scale}} = 100\\ \\mathrm{kPa}$.\n\nFor SLE, we consider the equilibrium between pure solid component $1$ and the binary liquid mixture. The equality of chemical potential, $\\mu_1^{\\text{solid}}(T) = \\mu_1^{L}(T,x_1)$, leads to the well-known relation under a set of standard assumptions (including negligible heat capacity difference between phases):\n$$\\ln(x_1\\gamma_1) = -\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{fus},1}}{R}\\left(\\frac{1}{T} - \\frac{1}{T_{m,1}}\\right)$$\nwhere $\\Delta H_{\\text{fus},1}$ and $T_{m,1}$ are the enthalpy of fusion and melting temperature of pure component $1$. The residual for SLE, $r_{\\text{SLE}}$, is constructed to be zero at equilibrium:\n$$r_{\\text{SLE}} = \\ln\\!\\big(x_1^{\\text{meas}}\\,\\gamma_1(T,x_1^{\\text{meas}};\\theta)\\big) + \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{fus},1}}{R}\\left(\\frac{1}{T} - \\frac{1}{T_{m,1}}\\right)$$\n\nThe parameter regression is formulated as a nonlinear least-squares optimization problem. The goal is to find the parameter vector $\\theta$ that minimizes the objective function $J(\\theta)$, which is a weighted sum of squared residuals from all $9$ VLE data points and $3$ SLE data points, augmented with a Tikhonov regularization term to prevent overfitting and ensure a well-conditioned problem:\n$$J(\\theta; w_{\\text{VLE}}, w_{\\text{SLE}}, \\lambda) = w_{\\text{VLE}} \\sum_{\\text{VLE}} r_{\\text{VLE}}^2 + w_{\\text{SLE}} \\sum_{\\text{SLE}} r_{\\text{SLE}}^2 + \\lambda \\sum_{j=1}^{6} \\theta_j^2$$\nThe weights $w_{\\text{VLE}}$ and $w_{\\text{SLE}}$ control the relative importance of fitting each dataset, and the regularization parameter $\\lambda$ controls the penalty on the magnitude of the parameters.\n\nThe computational implementation involves defining a function that computes a single vector containing all weighted residuals for a given $\\theta$. This vector includes $\\sqrt{w_{\\text{VLE}}} \\cdot r_{\\text{VLE}}$ for each VLE point, $\\sqrt{w_{\\text{SLE}}} \\cdot r_{\\text{SLE}}$ for each SLE point, and $\\sqrt{\\lambda} \\cdot \\theta_j$ for each of the $6$ parameters. A numerical solver, specifically `scipy.optimize.least_squares`, is then employed to find the $\\theta$ that minimizes the sum of the squares of the elements in this vector, starting from an initial guess of $\\theta = \\mathbf{0}$. The final minimized objective function value, $J^\\star$, is then calculated for each of the three specified test cases.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import least_squares\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Performs parameter regression for a binary liquid mixture activity coefficient model\n    against VLE and SLE data simultaneously, enforcing Gibbs-Duhem consistency.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Define physical and model constants\n    R = 8.314462618      # Universal gas constant in J/(mol K)\n    P_SCALE = 100.0      # Pressure scaling factor in kPa\n    \n    # Properties for component 1 (benzene)\n    DH_FUS1 = 9950.0     # Enthalpy of fusion in J/mol\n    TM1 = 278.68         # Melting temperature in K\n\n    # Experimental data\n    # Pure component saturation pressures P_sat(T) = (P1_sat, P2_sat) in kPa\n    PSAT_DATA = {\n        333.15: (53.0, 16.1),\n        353.15: (101.3, 29.4),\n        373.15: (160.0, 53.0)\n    }\n    # VLE data points: list of (T in K, x1 mole frac, P_meas in kPa)\n    VLE_DATA = [\n        (333.15, 0.2, 23.58), (333.15, 0.5, 34.40), (333.15, 0.8, 45.67),\n        (353.15, 0.2, 43.98), (353.15, 0.5, 65.35), (353.15, 0.8, 86.82),\n        (373.15, 0.2, 74.15), (373.15, 0.5, 106.60), (373.15, 0.8, 138.60)\n    ]\n    # SLE data points: list of (T in K, x1_meas mole frac)\n    SLE_DATA = [\n        (260.0, 0.737), (268.0, 0.840), (273.0, 0.916)\n    ]\n\n    # Test cases for regression\n    test_cases = [\n        # Case A (balanced): (w_vle, w_sle, lambda)\n        (1.0, 1.0, 1.0e-4),\n        # Case B (VLE-emphasis): (w_vle, w_sle, lambda)\n        (10.0, 1.0, 1.0e-4),\n        # Case C (SLE-emphasis): (w_vle, w_sle, lambda)\n        (1.0, 10.0, 1.0e-4),\n    ]\n\n    def get_residuals(theta, vle_data, sle_data, psat_data, constants, w_vle, w_sle, lam):\n        \"\"\"\n        Calculates the vector of weighted residuals for VLE, SLE, and regularization.\n        \"\"\"\n        a0, b0, c0, a1, b1, c1 = theta\n        R_const, dH_fus, Tm, p_scale = constants\n        \n        all_residuals = []\n\n        # -- VLE Residuals --\n        sqrt_w_vle = np.sqrt(w_vle)\n        for T, x1, P_meas in vle_data:\n            P1_sat, P2_sat = psat_data[T]\n            \n            # Calculate temperature-dependent Redlich-Kister coefficients\n            A0 = a0 + b0/T + c0*T\n            A1 = a1 + b1/T + c1*T\n            \n            # Calculate log activity coefficients\n            ln_g1 = (1 - x1)**2 * (A0 + A1 * (4*x1 - 1))\n            ln_g2 = x1**2 * (A0 + A1 * (4*x1 - 3))\n            \n            g1, g2 = np.exp(ln_g1), np.exp(ln_g2)\n            \n            # Calculate bubble point pressure\n            P_calc = x1 * g1 * P1_sat + (1 - x1) * g2 * P2_sat\n            \n            # Calculate and append weighted residual\n            r_vle = (P_calc - P_meas) / p_scale\n            all_residuals.append(sqrt_w_vle * r_vle)\n\n        # -- SLE Residuals --\n        sqrt_w_sle = np.sqrt(w_sle)\n        for T, x1_meas in sle_data:\n            # Calculate temperature-dependent Redlich-Kister coefficients\n            A0 = a0 + b0/T + c0*T\n            A1 = a1 + b1/T + c1*T\n            \n            # Calculate log activity coefficient for component 1\n            ln_g1 = (1 - x1_meas)**2 * (A0 + A1 * (4*x1_meas - 1))\n            \n            # Calculate and append weighted residual\n            r_sle = np.log(x1_meas) + ln_g1 + (dH_fus / R_const) * (1/T - 1/Tm)\n            all_residuals.append(sqrt_w_sle * r_sle)\n            \n        # -- Regularization terms --\n        reg_residuals = np.sqrt(lam) * theta\n        all_residuals.extend(reg_residuals)\n\n        return np.array(all_residuals)\n\n    results = []\n    theta0 = np.zeros(6)\n    constants_tuple = (R, DH_FUS1, TM1, P_SCALE)\n    \n    # Package arguments for the optimizer\n    args = (VLE_DATA, SLE_DATA, PSAT_DATA, constants_tuple)\n\n    for w_vle_case, w_sle_case, lam_case in test_cases:\n        # Append case-specific weights and lambda to arguments\n        current_args = args + (w_vle_case, w_sle_case, lam_case)\n        \n        # Perform the nonlinear least-squares optimization\n        res = least_squares(get_residuals, theta0, args=current_args, method='lm')\n        \n        # The cost is 0.5 * sum(residuals**2).
