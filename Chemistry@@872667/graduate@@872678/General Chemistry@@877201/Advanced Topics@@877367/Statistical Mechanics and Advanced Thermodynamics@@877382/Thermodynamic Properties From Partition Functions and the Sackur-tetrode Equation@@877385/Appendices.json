The problem correctly states that for quantum mechanical consistency, the phase-space volume must be divided by $h^{3}$, where $h$ is the Planck constant.\nThe single-particle partition function $q$ is therefore:\n$$ q = \\frac{1}{h^3} \\int \\dots \\int \\exp(-\\beta E(q, p)) \\, d^3q \\, d^3p $$\nwhere $\\beta = \\frac{1}{k_B T}$, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, $E(q, p)$ is the energy of the particle as a function of its generalized coordinates $q$ and momenta $p$. For a monatomic gas like argon, the energy is purely translational kinetic energy, which depends only on the momentum and not on position.\nThe energy is given by:\n$$ E = \\frac{p_x^2 + p_y^2 + p_z^2}{2m} $$\nwhere $m$ is the mass of the particle.

The condition for the classical limit to be applicable is that the thermal de Broglie wavelength of the particles is much smaller than the average distance between them. This is equivalent to the condition that the single-particle partition function $q_{\\mathrm{tr}}$ is much greater than unity.\n$$ q_{\\mathrm{tr}} = \\frac{v}{\\lambda^3} \\gg 1 $$\nHere, $v$ is the volume available per particle, and $\\lambda^3$ can be thought of as the quantum volume of a particle.

Since $9.919 \\times 10^6 \\gg 1$, the condition is overwhelmingly satisfied.\nTherefore, classical Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics are valid for argon under these conditions.

The Hamiltonian for a single particle is $H_{1} = \\frac{p^{2}}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^{2}r^{2}$. The expression for $q$ is given as:\n$$q = \\frac{1}{h^{3}} \\int \\mathrm{d}^{3}p \\, \\mathrm{d}^{3}r \\, \\exp\\left(-\\beta \\left(\\frac{p^{2}}{2m} + \\frac{1}{2}m\\omega^{2}r^{2}\\right)\\right)$$\nThe integral is separable into a momentum component and a spatial component.\n$$q = \\left(\\frac{1}{h^{3}} \\int \\mathrm{d}^{3}p \\, \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta p^{2}}{2m}\\right)\\right) \\left(\\int \\mathrm{d}^{3}r \\, \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\beta m\\omega^{2}r^{2}\\right)\\right)$$\nEach of these $3$-dimensional integrals can be separated into three identical $1$-dimensional Gaussian integrals. First, the momentum integral:\n$$ \\int \\mathrm{d}^{3}p \\, \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta p^{2}}{2m}\\right) = \\left(\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\mathrm{d}p_{x} \\, \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta p_{x}^{2}}{2m}\\right)\\right)^{3} $$\nUsing the standard result for a Gaussian integral $\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-ax^{2}}\\mathrm{d}x = \\sqrt{\\pi/a}$, with $a = \\beta/(2m)$, we have:\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\mathrm{d}p_{x} \\, \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\beta p_{x}^{2}}{2m}\\right) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi m}{\\beta}} = \\sqrt{2\\pi m k_{B} T} $$\nThus, the momentum part of the phase-space integral is $(2\\pi m k_{B} T)^{3/2}$.\n\nNext, the spatial integral:\n$$ \\int \\mathrm{d}^{3}r \\, \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\beta m\\omega^{2}r^{2}\\right) = \\left(\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\mathrm{d}x \\, \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\beta m\\omega^{2}x^{2}\\right)\\right)^{3} $$\nThis is another Gaussian integral with $a = \\frac{1}{2}\\beta m\\omega^{2}$.\n$$ \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\mathrm{d}x \\, \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\beta m\\omega^{2}x^{2}\\right) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi}{\\beta m\\omega^{2}}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2\\pi k_{B} T}{m\\omega^{2}}} $$\nThus, the spatial integral is $(\\frac{2\\pi k_{B} T}{m\\omega^{2}})^{3/2}$.\n\nCombining these results to find $q$:\n$$ q = \\frac{1}{h^{3}} (2\\pi m k_{B} T)^{3/2} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi k_{B} T}{m\\omega^{2}}\\right)^{3/2} = \\frac{1}{h^{3}} \\left(\\frac{4\\pi^{2} m (k_{B}T)^{2}}{m\\omega^{2}}\\right)^{3/2} $$\n$$ q = \\frac{1}{h^{3}} \\left(\\frac{2\\pi k_{B} T}{\\omega}\\right)^{3} = \\left(\\frac{2\\pi k_{B} T}{h\\omega}\\right)^{3} $$\nUsing Planck's reduced constant $\\hbar = h/(2\\pi)$:\n$$ q = \\left(\\frac{k_{B} T}{\\hbar\\omega}\\right)^{3} $$\nThe $N$-particle canonical partition function $Z$ for indistinguishable, noninteracting particles is:\n$$ Z = \\frac{q^{N}}{N!} = \\frac{1}{N!} \\left(\\frac{k_{B} T}{\\hbar\\omega}\\right)^{3N} $$\nThe Helmholtz free energy $F$ is given by $F = -k_{B}T \\ln Z$:\n$$ F = -k_{B}T \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{N!} \\left(\\frac{k_{B} T}{\\hbar\\omega}\\right)^{3N}\\right) = -k_{B}T \\left(3N \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{B} T}{\\hbar\\omega}\\right) - \\ln(N!)\\right) $$\nFor large $N$, we apply Stirling's approximation, $\\ln(N!) \\approx N\\ln(N) - N$:\n$$ F \\approx -k_{B}T \\left(3N \\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{B} T}{\\hbar\\omega}\\right) - N\\ln(N) + N\\right) $$\n$$ F \\approx N k_{B}T \\left(\\ln(N) - 1 - 3\\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{B} T}{\\hbar\\omega}\\right)\\right) $$\nThe entropy $S$ is found by differentiating $F$ with respect to $T$ at constant $N$ and $\\omega$:\n$$ S = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial T}\\right)_{N,\\omega} $$\nUsing the product rule for differentiation on the expression for $F$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial T} = N k_{B} \\left(\\ln(N) - 1 - 3\\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{B} T}{\\hbar\\omega}\\right)\\right) + N k_{B}T \\left(-3 \\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{k_{B}T} \\frac{k_{B}}{\\hbar\\omega}\\right) $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial T} = N k_{B} \\left(\\ln(N) - 1 - 3\\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{B} T}{\\hbar\\omega}\\right)\\right) - 3N k_{B} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial T} = N k_{B} \\left(\\ln(N) - 4 - 3\\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{B} T}{\\hbar\\omega}\\right)\\right) $$\nTherefore, the entropy is:\n$$ S = - \\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial T} = - N k_{B} \\left(\\ln(N) - 4 - 3\\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{B} T}{\\hbar\\omega}\\right)\\right) $$\n$$ S = N k_{B} \\left(4 - \\ln(N) + 3\\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{B} T}{\\hbar\\omega}\\right)\\right) $$\nBefore concluding, we briefly comment on the contrast with the Sackur-Tetrode equation for a gas in a uniform box of volume $V$. The Sackur-Tetrode entropy scales with temperature as $S \\propto \\frac{3}{2}N k_{B} \\ln(T)$, whereas for the harmonic trap, $S \\propto 3N k_{B} \\ln(T)$. This difference arises from the potential energy contribution. A particle in a harmonic trap has $3$ kinetic and $3$ potential degrees of freedom, for a total of $6$. By the equipartition theorem, the heat capacity is $C_{\\omega} = 3N k_{B}$. In contrast, a particle in a box has only $3$ kinetic degrees of freedom, so $C_{V} = \\frac{3}{2}N k_{B}$. Since $S(T) \\propto \\int (C/T)dT$, the logarithmic dependence on $T$ reflects the difference in heat capacities. Furthermore, the role of volume $V$ in the Sackur-Tetrode equation is replaced here by a dependence on $\\omega^{-3}$, as a weaker trap (smaller $\\omega$) allows the gas to expand into a larger effective volume.\n\nFinally, we compute the entropy per particle in units of $k_{B}$, $s = S/(N k_{B})$:\n$$ s = \\frac{S}{N k_{B}} = 4 - \\ln(N) + 3\\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{B} T}{\\hbar\\omega}\\right) $$\nThis can be rewritten to group the terms:\n$$ s = 4 + 3\\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{B} T}{\\hbar \\omega}\\right) - \\ln(N) $$\nThis is the final expression for the entropy per particle as a function of $N$, $T$, and $\\omega$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4 + 3\\ln\\left(\\frac{k_{B} T}{\\hbar \\omega}\\right) - \\ln(N)}$$", "id": "2962398"}]}
