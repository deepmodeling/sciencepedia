Use the tabulated Nicholson relationship... to map $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{p}}$ to the dimensionless kinetic parameter, then recover $k_0$ by rescaling with $\\left(\\pi D n F v/RT\\right)^{1/2}$. For $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{p}}=85\\ \\mathrm{mV}$, ... this gives $k_0$ on the order of $10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$. The interpolation assumes planar semi-infinite diffusion, negligible ohmic drop and capacitive current, no coupled homogeneous reactions or adsorption, $T=298\\ \\mathrm{K}$..., $\\alpha$ near $0.50$, $D_{\\mathrm{O}}\\approx D_{\\mathrm{R}}$, and is accurate only in the quasi-reversible range...**\n\n- The description of the theoretical procedure is correct.\n- The scaling factor $\\left(\\pi D n F v/RT\\right)^{1/2}$ is correct.\n- The numerical estimate, $k_0$ on the order of $10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$, matches our calculation.\n- The list of limitations is comprehensive and accurate. The method is indeed based on a specific theoretical model (planar diffusion, no $iR$ drop, etc.) and is most sensitive in the quasi-reversible regime. The standard working curves are generated for specific values of $T$, $\\alpha$, and for $D_O=D_R$.\n\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Because the peak separation is a purely thermodynamic quantity, start from the Nernst equation at equilibrium and note that $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{p}}$ does not depend on mass transport or scan rate. Therefore one can directly compute $k_0$ from $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{p}}$ alone... For $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{p}}=85\\ \\mathrm{mV}$, one obtains $k_0\\approx 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$. The only limitation is that $\\alpha$ should be exactly $0.50$.**\n\n- The premise that $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{p}}$ is a purely thermodynamic quantity is fundamentally false. It is a kinetic parameter. The Nernst equation describes equilibrium potentials, not the potential peaks in a dynamic CV experiment which are governed by kinetic overpotential and mass transport limitations.\n- The claim that $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{p}}$ is independent of mass transport and scan rate is false. For any non-reversible system, $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{p}}$ increases with scan rate $v$.\n- The numerical estimate $k_0\\approx 10^{-2}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$ is incorrect by two orders of magnitude. A system with such a high $k_0$ would appear nearly reversible ($\\Delta E_p \\approx 59\\ \\mathrm{mV}$) at this scan rate.\n- The list of limitations is grossly incomplete.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Starting from the planar diffusion equations and Butler–Volmer boundary, scale the problem... and then compute $k_0$ via $k_0=\\psi\\left(DRT/\\pi n F v\\right)^{1/2}$, which yields $k_0$ on the order of $10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$ for the given data. The interpolation is exact for all $\\alpha$ and any temperature, provided $D_{\\mathrm{O}}=D_{\\mathrm{R}}$.**\n\n- The formula for computing $k_0$, specifically the scaling factor $\\left(DRT/\\pi n F v\\right)^{1/2}$, is incorrect. It is the reciprocal of the correct scaling factor group. It is also dimensionally inconsistent, as it has units of length ($\\mathrm{m}$), not velocity ($\\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$).\n- The numerical estimate of $10^{-6}\\ \\mathrm{m\\,s^{-1}}$ is consequently incorrect and inconsistent with the given $\\Delta E_p$. A system with such a low $k_0$ would be much more irreversible and exhibit a far greater peak separation.\n- The claim that the interpolation is \"exact for all $\\alpha$ and any temperature\" is false. The relationship between $\\Delta E_p$ and $\\psi$ is strongly dependent on both $\\alpha$ and $T$.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Use the steady-state spherical diffusion model appropriate to microelectrodes, combined with the Tafel approximation at large overpotentials... Because $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{p}}$ is determined by steady-state mass transport, it is independent of $v$... The interpolation between $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{p}}$ and the kinetic parameter remains valid even in the presence of significant uncompensated resistance.**\n\n- The problem statement specifies a \"planar macroelectrode,\" so using a spherical diffusion model for microelectrodes is incorrect.\n- Transient cyclic voltammetry at a macroelectrode does not reach a steady state. Consequently, the premise that $\\Delta E_p$ is determined by steady-state transport and is independent of scan rate $v$ is false.\n- The statement that the method is valid in the presence of significant uncompensated resistance is dangerously false. $iR_u$ drop is a major source of error that artificially increases $\\Delta E_p$ and leads to an underestimation of $k_0$.\n\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\nBased on the detailed analysis, only option A provides a scientifically correct and complete account of the theory, application, and limitations of Nicholson's method.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2935749"}]}
