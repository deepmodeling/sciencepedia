This exercise challenges you to apply first principles of stereochemistry to a complex octahedral system, $[M(AA)_2XY]$. By systematically analyzing the spatial arrangements and identifying elements of symmetry, you will determine not only the number of distinct geometric isomers but also which of them are chiral, providing a complete map of the stereoisomeric landscape for this important class of complexes [@problem_id:2942826].", "problem": "An octahedral metal complex $\\mathrm{[M(AA)_{2}XY]}$ contains two identical bidentate chelate ligands $\\mathrm{AA}$ (assume $\\mathrm{AA}$ is a symmetric bidentate chelate with equivalent donor atoms, for example ethylenediamine, and that each $\\mathrm{AA}$ necessarily occupies two adjacent, that is, *cis*, coordination sites) and two distinct monodentate ligands $\\mathrm{X}$ and $\\mathrm{Y}$. Using only the core definitions of geometric isomerism (different relative spatial arrangements of ligands that are not interconverted without bond breaking) and optical isomerism (non-superimposable mirror-image forms; chirality requires absence of any improper symmetry such as a mirror plane, center of inversion, or improper rotation axis), and the well-established structural constraint that a single bidentate chelate in an octahedral field necessarily binds to two adjacent positions (never *trans*), analyze all distinct spatial arrangements permitted by the octahedral geometry.\n\nDerive from first principles:\n- the number of distinct geometric isomers (counting *cis*/*trans* and any non-equivalent *cis* arrangements that cannot be interconverted by a proper rotation that preserves ligand identities), and\n- for each geometric isomer, whether it is chiral (that is, whether it exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images).\n\nLet $S$ denote the total number of stereoisomers (counting enantiomers separately) and let $C$ denote the number of chiral stereoisomers (that is, members of enantiomeric pairs). Report your result as the ordered pair $(S,C)$. Express the final ordered pair as a row matrix and do not include units. No rounding is required.", "solution": "The problem statement is a well-posed question in the field of coordination chemistry, specifically concerning stereoisomerism. It is scientifically grounded, objective, and provides all necessary information to deduce a unique answer from first principles. The problem is valid.\n\nThe complex is of the form $\\mathrm{[M(AA)_{2}XY]}$, where the coordination geometry is octahedral. $\\mathrm{M}$ is a central metal atom. $\\mathrm{AA}$ is a symmetric bidentate ligand that chelates at two adjacent (*cis*) positions. $\\mathrm{X}$ and $\\mathrm{Y}$ are distinct monodentate ligands. We must determine the total number of stereoisomers, $S$, and the number of chiral stereoisomers, $C$.\n\nAn octahedral complex has six coordination sites. We can label these sites with numbers $1$ through $6$. Let site $1$ be the apex ($+z$ axis), site $6$ be the nadir ($-z$ axis), and sites $2, 3, 4, 5$ be the equatorial positions (e.g., $+x, +y, -x, -y$ axes, respectively). Pairs of *trans* (opposite) positions are $(1, 6)$, $(2, 4)$, and $(3, 5)$. All other adjacent pairs are *cis*.\n\nThe analysis can be divided into two cases based on the relative positions of the monodentate ligands $\\mathrm{X}$ and $\\mathrm{Y}$.\n\nCase 1: Ligands $\\mathrm{X}$ and $\\mathrm{Y}$ are *trans* to each other.\nWithout loss of generality, let us place ligand $\\mathrm{X}$ at site $1$ and ligand $\\mathrm{Y}$ at site $6$. The remaining four equatorial sites, $\\{2, 3, 4, 5\\}$, must be occupied by the two bidentate ligands, $(\\mathrm{AA})_{2}$. Since each $\\mathrm{AA}$ ligand must occupy two *cis* positions, the only way to arrange two such ligands on the four coplanar sites is to have one ligand occupy sites $(2, 3)$ and the other occupy sites $(4, 5)$. (The alternative, $(3,4)$ and $(5,2)$, is identical by rotation). This defines a single geometric isomer for the *trans* case.\n\nNow, we must determine if this isomer is chiral. A molecule is achiral if it possesses an improper axis of rotation ($S_n$), which includes a center of inversion ($S_2 = i$) or a plane of symmetry ($S_1 = \\sigma$). Let us examine the symmetry of this *trans* isomer: $\\mathrm{X}$ at site $1$, $\\mathrm{Y}$ at site $6$, one $\\mathrm{AA}$ ligand at $(2,3)$, and the second $\\mathrm{AA}$ at $(4,5)$.\nConsider a plane of symmetry that contains the central atom $\\mathrm{M}$, the ligands $\\mathrm{X}$ and $\\mathrm{Y}$, and bisects the two chelate rings. This plane passes through sites $1$ and $6$. In the equatorial plane, it bisects the angle $\\angle 2\\mathrm{M}5$ and the angle $\\angle 3\\mathrm{M}4$. This plane reflects site $2$ to site $5$ and site $3$ to site $4$.\nThe first chelate ring connecting sites $(2,3)$ is reflected to a connection between sites $(5,4)$. This is precisely the location of the second chelate ring.\nThe second chelate ring connecting sites $(4,5)$ is reflected to a connection between sites $(3,2)$. This corresponds to the first chelate ring.\nThe ligands $\\mathrm{X}$ and $\\mathrm{Y}$ lie on the plane and are reflected onto themselves.\nSince the entire molecule is transformed into itself by this reflection, this plane is a plane of symmetry ($\\sigma$). The presence of a mirror plane renders the molecule achiral.\nTherefore, for the *trans* arrangement, there is $1$ geometric isomer, and it is achiral.\nNumber of stereoisomers from this case: $1$.\nNumber of chiral stereoisomers from this case: $0$.\n\nCase 2: Ligands $\\mathrm{X}$ and $\\mathrm{Y}$ are *cis* to each other.\nWithout loss of generality, let ligand $\\mathrm{X}$ be at site $1$ and ligand $\\mathrm{Y}$ be at site $2$. The remaining four sites $\\{3, 4, 5, 6\\}$ must be occupied by the two bidentate ligands $(\\mathrm{AA})_{2}$. We must find pairs of disjoint *cis* sites from this set.\nThe available *cis* pairs from $\\{3, 4, 5, 6\\}$ are: $(3,4)$, $(3,6)$, $(4,5)$, $(4,6)$, and $(5,6)$. The pair $(3,5)$ is *trans*.\nWe need to select two disjoint pairs from this list.\nPossibility A: We choose the pair $(3,4)$. The remaining sites are $\\{5,6\\}$, which are *cis*. So, one way to arrange the chelates is AA at $(3,4)$ and AA at $(5,6)$.\nPossibility B: We choose the pair $(3,6)$. The remaining sites are $\\{4,5\\}$, which are *cis*. So, a second way is AA at $(3,6)$ and AA at $(4,5)$.\nLet's check other starting points. If we start with $(4,5)$, the remainder is $\\{3,6\\}$, giving Possibility B. If we start with $(4,6)$, the remainder is $\\{3,5\\}$, which is a *trans* pair, so this is not a valid arrangement. If we start with $(5,6)$, the remainder is $\\{3,4\\}$, giving Possibility A.\nThus, there are exactly two distinct ways to arrange the two AA ligands when X and Y are *cis*. These represent two distinct geometric isomers.\n\nIsomer *cis*-A: $\\mathrm{X}(1), \\mathrm{Y}(2), \\mathrm{AA}_1(3,4), \\mathrm{AA}_2(5,6)$.\nIsomer *cis*-B: $\\mathrm{X}(1), \\mathrm{Y}(2), \\mathrm{AA}_1(3,6), \\mathrm{AA}_2(4,5)$.\nThese two isomers cannot be interconverted by rotation because the connectivity of the chelate rings is different. For example, in isomer *cis*-A, atom at site $3$ is chelated to atom at site $4$, while in *cis*-B, it is chelated to atom at site $6$.\n\nNext, we assess the chirality of these two geometric isomers.\nFor a complex to be chiral, it must not possess any $S_n$ axis. Both *cis*-A and *cis*-B arrangements are highly asymmetric due to the distinct nature of $\\mathrm{X}$ and $\\mathrm{Y}$ and the complex arrangement of the chelates.\nLet's analyze Isomer *cis*-A: $\\mathrm{X}(1), \\mathrm{Y}(2), \\mathrm{AA}_1(3,4), \\mathrm{AA}_2(5,6)$.\nThere is no center of inversion (e.g., $\\mathrm{X}$ at $1$ is *trans* to an $\\mathrm{A}$ atom at $6$; $\\mathrm{Y}$ at $2$ is *trans* to an $\\mathrm{A}$ atom at $4$).\nThere are no rotational axes of symmetry.\nThere are no mirror planes. For instance, the plane containing $(1,6,3,5)$ is not a mirror plane because it would reflect $\\mathrm{Y}(2)$ to site $4$, which is occupied by an $\\mathrm{A}$ atom.\nThe lack of any $S_n$ axis means the point group is $C_1$. Therefore, Isomer *cis*-A is chiral and must exist as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers).\n\nSimilarly, for Isomer *cis*-B: $\\mathrm{X}(1), \\mathrm{Y}(2), \\mathrm{AA}_1(3,6), \\mathrm{AA}_2(4,5)$.\nThis arrangement also lacks any center of inversion, rotational axes, or mirror planes. It belongs to the $C_1$ point group and is therefore chiral. It also exists as an enantiomeric pair.\nThe two geometric isomers *cis*-A and *cis*-B are diastereomers of each other. Each one is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers.\n\nIn summary, for the *cis* case: there are $2$ geometric isomers, and both are chiral.\nNumber of stereoisomers from this case: $2$ (from *cis*-A pair) $+ 2$ (from *cis*-B pair) $= 4$.\nNumber of chiral stereoisomers from this case: $4$.\n\nTotal count:\nThe total number of stereoisomers, $S$, is the sum of stereoisomers from both cases.\n$S = 1$ (from *trans*-achiral) $+ 4$ (from *cis*-chiral pairs) $= 5$.\nThe total number of chiral stereoisomers, $C$, are those that exist as enantiomeric pairs.\n$C = 0$ (from *trans*-achiral) $+ 4$ (from *cis*-chiral pairs) $= 4$.\n\nThe result is the ordered pair $(S, C)$.\n$(S, C) = (5, 4)$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n5  4\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2942826"}, {"introduction": "Once theoretical isomers are identified, the next step is to distinguish them experimentally.

We will proceed directly to the derivation.\n\nThe general formula for the family of chromium(III) hydrate isomers is given as $\\mathrm{[CrCl_x(H_2O)_{6-x}]Cl_{3-x}}$. We must first understand the structure and stoichiometry dictated by fundamental chemical principles.\n\n$1$.

The charge of the coordination complex is the sum of the charges of its constituent parts. The chloride ligand has a charge of $-1$, and the water ligand is neutral ($0$).

The equilibrium constant expression is:\n$$ K = \\frac{[\\left[\\mathrm{Co}\\left(\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\right)_{5}\\mathrm{NO}_{2}\\right]^{2+}]}{[\\left[\\mathrm{Co}\\left(\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\right)_{5}\\mathrm{ONO}\\right]^{2+}]} $$\nAt $T_{1}=298\\ \\mathrm{K}$, $K_{1}=10.00$. Since $K_{1}  1$, the concentration of the product, the $N$-bound nitro isomer $\\left[\\mathrm{Co}\\left(\\mathrm{NH}_{3}\\right)_{5}\\mathrm{NO}_{2}\\right]^{2+}$, is greater than the concentration of the reactant, the $O$-bound nitrito isomer. Therefore, the $N$-bound nitro isomer is thermodynamically dominant at $298\\ \\mathrm{K}$. This is also consistent with the negative value of $\\Delta G^{\\circ}_{298}$, which indicates the forward reaction is spontaneous under standard conditions.\n\nFinally, we compute the equilibrium mole fraction of the $N$-bound nitro isomer, $x_{\\mathrm{nitro}}$, at $T=298\\ \\mathrm{K}$. Let $x_{\\mathrm{nitrito}}$ be the mole fraction of the $O$-bound nitrito isomer. We are given that their total mole fraction is $1$:\n$$ x_{\\mathrm{nitro}} + x_{\\mathrm{nitrito}} = 1 $$\nUnder the assumption that activities can be replaced by concentrations (and thus by mole fractions for a two-component mixture), the equilibrium constant at $298\\ \\mathrm{K}$ is the ratio of the mole fractions:\n$$ K_{1} = \\frac{x_{\\mathrm{nitro}}}{x_{\\mathrm{nitrito}}} $$\nSubstituting $x_{\\mathrm{nitrito}} = 1 - x_{\\mathrm{nitro}}$:\n$$ K_{1} = \\frac{x_{\\mathrm{nitro}}}{1 - x_{\\mathrm{nitro}}} $$\nWe solve for $x_{\\mathrm{nitro}}$:\n$$ K_{1}(1 - x_{\\mathrm{nitro}}) = x_{\\mathrm{nitro}} $$\n$$ K_{1} - K_{1} x_{\\mathrm{nitro}} = x_{\\mathrm{nitro}} $$\n$$ K_{1} = x_{\\mathrm{nitro}} (1 + K_{1}) $$\n$$ x_{\\mathrm{nitro}} = \\frac{K_{1}}{1 + K_{1}} $$\nSubstituting $K_{1} = 10.00$:\n$$ x_{\\mathrm{nitro}} = \\frac{10.00}{1 + 10.00} = \\frac{10.00}{11.00} $$\n$$ x_{\\mathrm{nitro}} \\approx 0.909090... $$\nRounding to four significant figures as required for the final answer:\n$$ x_{\\mathrm{nitro}} = 0.9091 $$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.9091}\n$$", "id": "2942900"}]}
