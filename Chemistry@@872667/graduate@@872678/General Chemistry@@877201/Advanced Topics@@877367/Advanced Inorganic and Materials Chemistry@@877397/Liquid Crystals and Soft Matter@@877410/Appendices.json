The dimensionless concentration is defined as $c \\equiv n B_{2}$, where $n$ is the number density and $B_{2}$ is the orientationally-averaged second virial coefficient. The critical threshold is given as $c^{\\ast} = 3.29$. The problem asks for evaluation with four significant figures, so we take $c^{\\ast} = 3.290$. At the transition, we have:\n$$n^{\\ast} B_{2} = c^{\\ast}$$\nwhere $n^{\\ast}$ is the critical number density.\n\nThe volume fraction $\\phi$ is the fraction of space occupied by the particles. It is defined as the product of the number density and the volume of a single particle, $v_{p}$:\n$$\\phi = n v_{p}$$\nAt the critical point, the volume fraction is $\\phi^{\\ast} = n^{\\ast} v_{p}$. From this relation, we express the critical number density as $n^{\\ast} = \\phi^{\\ast} / v_{p}$. Substituting this into the critical condition gives:\n$$\\left( \\frac{\\phi^{\\ast}}{v_{p}} \\right) B_{2} = c^{\\ast}$$\nRearranging for the critical volume fraction $\\phi^{\\ast}$, we obtain the central relation for this problem:\n$$\\phi^{\\ast} = c^{\\ast} \\frac{v_{p}}{B_{2}}$$\n\nTo proceed, we must determine the expressions for the particle volume $v_{p}$ and the second virial coefficient $B_{2}$ for a spherocylinder of length $L$ and diameter $D$. A spherocylinder is a cylinder of length $L$ and diameter $D$ capped by two hemispheres of the same diameter.\nThe volume of the cylindrical portion is $\\frac{\\pi}{4} D^{2} L$. The volume of the two hemispherical caps is equivalent to the volume of a sphere of diameter $D$, which is $\\frac{\\pi}{6} D^{3}$. The total volume of a spherocylinder is therefore:\n$$v_{p} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} D^{2} L + \\frac{\\pi}{6} D^{3} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} D^{2} L \\left( 1 + \\frac{2}{3} \\frac{D}{L} \\right)$$\nIn the slender-rod limit ($L \\gg D$), the term $\\frac{D}{L}$ is small, and the leading-order approximation for the volume is:\n$$v_{p} \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{4} D^{2} L$$\n\nThe second virial coefficient $B_{2}$ for convex bodies is half the orientationally-averaged excluded volume, $B_{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\langle V_{ex} \\rangle_{iso}$. For two spherocylinders with orientation vectors making an angle $\\gamma$ with each other, the exact excluded volume is $V_{ex}(\\gamma) = 2L^{2}D|\\sin\\gamma| + 2\\pi LD^{2} + \\frac{4\\pi}{3}D^3$.\nTo find the isotropic average, we integrate over all relative orientations with equal probability. The average of $|\\sin\\gamma|$ over isotropic orientations is $\\langle|\\sin\\gamma|\\rangle_{iso} = \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} \\sin\\gamma \\sin\\gamma \\, d\\gamma = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$.\nThe isotropically averaged excluded volume is:\n$$\\langle V_{ex} \\rangle_{iso} = 2L^{2}D \\langle|\\sin\\gamma|\\rangle_{iso} + 2\\pi LD^{2} + \\frac{4\\pi}{3}D^3 = 2L^{2}D \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) + 2\\pi LD^{2} + \\frac{4\\pi}{3}D^3$$\nThus, the second virial coefficient is:\n$$B_{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\langle V_{ex} \\rangle_{iso} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} L^{2} D + \\pi L D^{2} + \\frac{2\\pi}{3} D^{3} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} L^{2} D \\left(1 + 4\\frac{D}{L} + \\frac{8}{3}\\left(\\frac{D}{L}\\right)^{2}\\right)$$\nIn the slender-rod limit ($L \\gg D$), the leading-order term dominates:\n$$B_{2} \\approx \\frac{\\pi}{4} L^{2} D$$\n\nNow we substitute the leading-order approximations for $v_p$ and $B_2$ into our expression for $\\phi^{\\ast}$:\n$$\\phi^{\\ast} \\approx c^{\\ast} \\frac{\\frac{\\pi}{4} D^{2} L}{\\frac{\\pi}{4} L^{2} D} = c^{\\ast} \\frac{D^{2} L}{L^{2} D}$$\nThis simplifies to the desired expression for the critical volume fraction in terms of the aspect ratio $L/D$:\n$$\\phi^{\\ast} = c^{\\ast} \\frac{D}{L}$$\n\nNext, we evaluate this expression for an aspect ratio of $L/D = 100$. Using the provided critical value $c^{\\ast} = 3.290$:\n$$\\phi^{\\ast} = 3.290 \\times \\frac{1}{100} = 0.03290$$\nThis is the critical volume fraction for the onset of nematic order under the leading-order slender-rod approximation, rounded to four significant figures.\n\nFinally, we discuss the leading corrections.\n\n(i) Finite thickness effects: These corrections arise from using the full expressions for $v_p$ and $B_2$ rather than just the leading-order terms.

The correction factor is negative, so finite thickness effects *decrease* the critical volume fraction. The leading correction scales with $D/L$ relative to the leading-order result, meaning the absolute correction scales as $(D/L)^2$.\n\n(ii) Higher virial contributions: Onsager's theory truncates the virial expansion of the free energy at the second-order term ($B_2$). The full expansion includes third ($B_3$), fourth ($B_4$), and higher-order virial coefficients. For particles with hard-core repulsion, all virial coefficients ($B_k$) are positive. Including the $B_3$ term and higher adds positive, repulsive contributions to the free energy density. This increases the free energy of the dense isotropic state more than that of the nematic state, where particles are partially aligned and avoid each other more effectively. Consequently, the nematic phase becomes favorable at a lower density. Therefore, including higher virial contributions is expected to *decrease* the critical volume fraction $\\phi^{\\ast}$. The correction due to the third virial coefficient is known from more advanced theories to scale with $D/L$, often with an additional logarithmic dependence of the form $(D/L)\\ln(L/D)$, making it a small correction for very slender rods.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.03290}$$", "id": "2945031"}, {"introduction": "Once a nematic liquid crystal phase is formed, we need a way to quantify its degree of molecular alignment.

We shall proceed with its solution. The problem consists of two parts: first, a derivation of the relationship between macroscopic optical birefringence, $\\Delta n$, and the nematic scalar order parameter, $S$; second, a calculation of $S$ using provided data.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Relationship between $\\Delta n$ and $S$.\n\nAt optical frequencies, the magnetic permeability of the medium is effectively that of free space, $\\mu_r \\approx 1$. The refractive index, $n$, is therefore related to the relative dielectric permittivity, $\\epsilon_r$, by the Maxwell relation $n^2 = \\epsilon_r$. For an anisotropic medium like a uniaxial nematic liquid crystal, both the dielectric permittivity and the refractive index are tensorial quantities. Let the director, which is the axis of macroscopic uniaxial symmetry, be aligned with the $z$-axis of our laboratory coordinate system. The dielectric tensor $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$ is diagonal in this frame, with components $\\epsilon_{zz} = \\epsilon_{\\parallel}$ and $\\epsilon_{xx} = \\epsilon_{yy} = \\epsilon_{\\perp}$. Consequently, the refractive indices for light polarized parallel and perpendicular to the director are $n_{\\parallel} = \\sqrt{\\epsilon_{\\parallel}}$ and $n_{\\perp} = \\sqrt{\\epsilon_{\\perp}}$, respectively. The birefringence is defined as $\\Delta n = n_{\\parallel} - n_{\\perp}$.\n\nThe macroscopic dielectric permittivity arises from the collective response of the molecular electric dipoles to an applied electric field. The induced dipole moment $\\mathbf{p}$ of a single molecule is given by $\\mathbf{p} = \\boldsymbol{\\alpha} \\mathbf{E}_{\\text{loc}}$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ is the molecular polarizability tensor and $\\mathbf{E}_{\\text{loc}}$ is the local electric field experienced by the molecule. The macroscopic polarization is $\\mathbf{P} = N \\langle \\mathbf{p} \\rangle$, where $N$ is the number density of molecules and $\\langle \\cdot \\rangle$ denotes an ensemble average over the molecular orientations.\n\nThe molecular polarizability tensor, in the frame of a rod-like molecule (with its long axis along $z'$), is also uniaxial and diagonal: $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{\\text{mol}} = \\text{diag}(\\alpha_{\\perp,m}, \\alpha_{\\perp,m}, \\alpha_{\\parallel,m})$, where $\\alpha_{\\parallel,m}$ and $\\alpha_{\\perp,m}$ are the polarizabilities parallel and perpendicular to the molecular long axis. To find the macroscopic permittivity, we must average the components of $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}$ in the lab frame. If $\\theta$ is the angle between the molecular long axis ($z'$) and the director ($z$), the components of the polarizability tensor for a single molecule in the lab frame are:\n$$\\alpha_{zz} = \\alpha_{\\parallel,m} \\cos^2\\theta + \\alpha_{\\perp,m} \\sin^2\\theta$$\n$$\\alpha_{xx} = (\\alpha_{\\parallel,m} \\sin^2\\theta + \\alpha_{\\perp,m} \\cos^2\\theta)\\cos^2\\phi + \\alpha_{\\perp,m} \\sin^2\\phi$$\nwhere $\\phi$ is the azimuthal angle. Due to the uniaxial symmetry about the director, we average over $\\phi$ to find $\\langle \\alpha_{xx} \\rangle = \\langle \\alpha_{yy} \\rangle = \\langle \\alpha_{\\perp} \\rangle$.\nThe ensemble-averaged components are:\n$$\\langle \\alpha_{\\parallel} \\rangle = \\langle \\alpha_{zz} \\rangle = \\alpha_{\\parallel,m} \\langle \\cos^2\\theta \\rangle + \\alpha_{\\perp,m} \\langle \\sin^2\\theta \\rangle$$\n$$\\langle \\alpha_{\\perp} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}\\langle \\alpha_{xx} + \\alpha_{yy} \\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} \\langle \\alpha_{\\parallel,m}\\sin^2\\theta + \\alpha_{\\perp,m}(\\cos^2\\theta+1) \\rangle$$\nThe nematic order parameter is defined as $S = \\langle \\frac{3\\cos^2\\theta-1}{2} \\rangle$.

In this case, $n_{\\parallel} \\approx \\bar{n}$ and $n_{\\perp} \\approx \\bar{n}$, so $n_{\\parallel} + n_{\\perp} \\approx 2\\bar{n}$.\nThe second assumption is that this average refractive index $\\bar{n}$ is effectively constant with respect to changes in the order parameter $S$. This is a valid assumption if the number density $N$ does not change significantly as $S$ varies (e.g., with temperature). The problem specifies that the comparison is made at the same density.\nUnder these assumptions:\n$$\\Delta n \\approx \\left(\\frac{C}{2\\bar{n}}\\right) S$$\nThis establishes the leading-order linear proportionality between the birefringence $\\Delta n$ and the order parameter $S$. We can write this as $\\Delta n = K \\cdot S$, where $K$ is the proportionality constant.\n\nTo determine $K$, we consider the hypothetical state of perfect molecular alignment. In this state, $\\theta=0$ for all molecules, and the order parameter $S$ takes its maximum value, $S = \\frac{3\\cos^2(0)-1}{2} = 1$. The birefringence in this state is given as $\\Delta n_0$.
