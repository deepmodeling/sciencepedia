It requests the application of standard, fundamental principles of organometallic chemistry—ligand classification, electron counting, and the Hard and Soft Acids and Bases (HSAB) principle—to a specified molecular complex. The problem is therefore valid, and a rigorous solution can be constructed.\n\nThe complex under consideration is tetracoordinate nickel, $\\mathrm{Ni}(\\mathrm{PPh_3})_{2}(\\mathrm{CH_3})_{2}$.\n\nFirst, we classify the ligands according to the Green covalent (L/X/Z) classification scheme. This model treats the metal-ligand bonds as formally covalent and considers the ligands as neutral fragments.\n- The triphenylphosphine ligand, $\\mathrm{PPh_3}$, is a neutral molecule with a lone pair on the phosphorus atom. It donates this lone pair to form a coordinate bond with the metal center. As a neutral, two-electron donor, it is classified as an L-type ligand.\n- The methyl group, $\\mathrm{CH_3}$, is treated as a radical, $\\cdot\\mathrm{CH_3}$. It forms a single covalent bond with the metal by contributing one electron, with the metal also contributing one electron. Therefore, it is classified as an X-type ligand.\n\nNext, we assign a formal oxidation state to the nickel center. This requires invoking the ionic model, where metal-ligand bonds are imagined to be cleaved heterolytically. The electron pair in the bond is assigned to the more electronegative atom. The Pauling electronegativity of nickel is $\\chi_{\\mathrm{Ni}} \\approx 1.91$, while that of carbon is $\\chi_{\\mathrm{C}} \\approx 2.55$.\n- For the $\\mathrm{Ni-C}$ bonds, carbon is more electronegative than nickel. Thus, heterolytic cleavage assigns the bonding pair to the methyl fragment, which becomes the methyl anion, $\\mathrm{CH_3}^-$. Each $\\mathrm{CH_3}^-$ ligand contributes a formal charge of $-1$.\n- The $\\mathrm{PPh_3}$ ligands are neutral L-type ligands and are treated as neutral molecules in both the covalent and ionic models. They contribute a formal charge of $0$.\nThe overall complex is neutral. The formal oxidation state of nickel, $\\mathrm{Ox}_{\\mathrm{Ni}}$, is determined by the charge balance equation:\n$$ \\mathrm{Ox}_{\\mathrm{Ni}} + 2 \\times (\\text{charge of } \\mathrm{PPh_3}) + 2 \\times (\\text{charge of } \\mathrm{CH_3}) = 0 $$\n$$ \\mathrm{Ox}_{\\mathrm{Ni}} + 2 \\times (0) + 2 \\times (-1) = 0 $$\nSolving this gives $\\mathrm{Ox}_{\\mathrm{Ni}} = +2$. Therefore, the metal center is formally $\\mathrm{Ni}(\\mathrm{II})$.\nFrom an HSAB perspective, a $\\mathrm{Ni}(\\mathrm{II})$ center is a borderline soft acid. The methyl anion $\\mathrm{CH_3}^-$ is a soft base, and triphenylphosphine $\\mathrm{PPh_3}$ is also a soft base. The combination of a borderline soft acid with soft bases is favorable, lending credence to this oxidation state assignment.\n\nWe will now perform the total valence electron count ($\\mathrm{VEC}$) using both the covalent and ionic models.\n1.  **Covalent (Neutral Ligand) Model:**\n    - Nickel ($\\mathrm{Ni}$) is in Group $10$ of the periodic table, so it contributes $10$ valence electrons.\n    - Each of the two L-type $\\mathrm{PPh_3}$ ligands contributes $2$ electrons, for a total of $2 \\times 2 = 4$ electrons.\n    - Each of the two X-type $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ ligands contributes $1$ electron, for a total of $2 \\times 1 = 2$ electrons.\n    - The total valence electron count is $\\mathrm{VEC} = 10 + 4 + 2 = 16$.\n\n2.  **Ionic (Donor Pair) Model:**\n    - The metal center is $\\mathrm{Ni}(\\mathrm{II})$. A neutral $\\mathrm{Ni}$ atom (Group $10$) has $10$ valence electrons ($d^{8}s^2$). A $\\mathrm{Ni}^{2+}$ ion thus has $10 - 2 = 8$ valence electrons (a $d^8$ configuration).\n    - Each of the two neutral $\\mathrm{PPh_3}$ ligands is a two-electron donor, for a total of $2 \\times 2 = 4$ electrons.\n    - Each of the two anionic $\\mathrm{CH_3}^-$ ligands is a two-electron donor, for a total of $2 \\times 2 = 4$ electrons.\n    - The total valence electron count is $\\mathrm{VEC} = 8 + 4 + 4 = 16$.\n\nBoth counting methods consistently yield a $\\mathrm{VEC}$ of $16$. The problem asks to rationalize the geometry implied by the $18$-electron rule. However, our rigorous calculation shows the complex has $16$ valence electrons, not $18$. Late transition metals, particularly those in $d^8$ configurations, frequently form stable $16$-electron complexes with a square planar geometry. In this geometry, the $d$-orbitals split such that the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital is high in energy and left unoccupied, leading to a stable closed-shell singlet state for the $16$ electrons. A tetrahedral $d^8$ complex would be a less stable high-spin species. Therefore, the actual electron count of $16$ strongly implies a square planar geometry for this $\\mathrm{Ni}(\\mathrm{II})$ $d^8$ complex, not a geometry that would satisfy the $18$-electron rule.\n\nFinally, we compute the electron deficiency, $\\Delta$, with respect to the $18$-electron rule. The definition is given as $\\Delta \\equiv 18 - \\mathrm{VEC}$.\nUsing our calculated value of $\\mathrm{VEC} = 16$:\n$$ \\Delta = 18 - 16 = 2 $$\nThe electron deficiency is $2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2}$$", "id": "2948954"}, {"introduction": "While many ligands have straightforward electron-donating properties, some, like the nitrosyl ($\\mathrm{NO}$) ligand, are \"non-innocent,\" capable of multiple bonding modes and formalisms.

This exercise will not only test your command of electron counting but also introduce the Enemark–Feltham notation, an indispensable tool for unambiguously describing metal-nitrosyl fragments and resolving the formalisms' apparent contradictions.", "problem": "A square-pyramidal, $5$-coordinate chromium nitrosyl carbonyl phosphine, $\\mathrm{Cr}(\\mathrm{NO})(\\mathrm{CO})_3(\\mathrm{PMe_3})$, is proposed to be isolable in an inert solvent at ambient temperature. From first principles of the $18$-electron rule, the ligand donor classifications in the covalent (neutral) and ionic electron-counting schemes, and the Enemark–Feltham notation for metal–nitrosyl units, determine how the linear versus bent description of the nitrosyl affects the total valence electron count at chromium. Use the following foundational bases and facts: the $18$-electron rule posits enhanced thermodynamic stability when the metal valence shell is filled to $18$ electrons; in the covalent (neutral) electron-counting method, carbon monoxide and trialkylphosphines are $2$-electron donors; in the ionic method, anionic $X$-type ligands contribute $2$ electrons and neutral $L$-type ligands contribute $2$ electrons to the metal valence count; the nitrosyl ligand can be described as linear (formally $\\mathrm{NO}^+$, strong $\\pi$-acceptor) or bent (formally $\\mathrm{NO}^-$, stronger $\\sigma$-donor and weaker $\\pi$-acceptor); the Enemark–Feltham notation $\\{\\mathrm{MNO}\\}^n$ defines $n$ as the total number of electrons occupying the set of metal $d_{\\pi}$ and $\\mathrm{NO}\\ \\pi^*$ orbitals. Begin from the periodic group of chromium and the standard donor classifications above, and explicitly derive the total valence electron count for the linear and bent nitrosyl descriptions using the covalent method. Then, using the ionic method, assign the oxidation state of chromium for each nitrosyl description, compute the chromium $d$-electron count, and determine the Enemark–Feltham index $n$ for $\\{\\mathrm{CrNO}\\}^n$ by summing the chromium $d$ electrons and the occupancy of the $\\mathrm{NO}\\ \\pi^*$ manifold appropriate to the linear and bent descriptions.

Report the Enemark–Feltham index $n$ as a single integer with no units as your final answer.", "solution": "The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information to derive a solution. It tests fundamental concepts of organometallic chemistry, including electron counting, ligand classification, and the application of qualitative bonding theories. We proceed to the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a multistep analysis of the complex $\\mathrm{Cr}(\\mathrm{NO})(\\mathrm{CO})_3(\\mathrm{PMe_3})$. We begin by establishing the ground state electronic configuration of the central metal atom. Chromium ($\\mathrm{Cr}$) is a member of Group $6$ of the periodic table, so a neutral chromium atom contributes $6$ valence electrons.\n\nFirst, we determine the total valence electron (TVE) count for the complex using the covalent (or neutral ligand) model, considering the two possible geometries of the nitrosyl ligand as stipulated. In this model, the metal and all ligands are treated as neutral entities. The standard donor numbers for the ancillary ligands are given: carbon monoxide ($\\mathrm{CO}$) is a $2$-electron donor, and trimethylphosphine ($\\mathrm{PMe_3}$) is also a $2$-electron donor. The electron contribution of the nitrosyl ($\\mathrm{NO}$) ligand depends on its coordination mode, which is a convention used to reconcile the model with experimental observations.\nFor a linear $\\mathrm{M-N-O}$ arrangement, the $\\mathrm{NO}$ ligand is treated as a $2$-electron donor.\nFor a bent $\\mathrm{M-N-O}$ arrangement, the $\\mathrm{NO}$ ligand is treated as a $1$-electron donor.\n\nCase 1: Linear Nitrosyl\nThe total valence electron count is the sum of electrons from the metal and all ligands:\n$$ \\text{TVE (linear)} = (\\text{electrons from } \\mathrm{Cr}) + (\\text{electrons from linear } \\mathrm{NO}) + 3 \\times (\\text{electrons from } \\mathrm{CO}) + (\\text{electrons from } \\mathrm{PMe_3}) $$\n$$ \\text{TVE (linear)} = 6 + 2 + 3 \\times 2 + 2 = 16 $$\nA complex with a $16$-electron count is electron-deficient with respect to the $18$-electron rule.\n\nCase 2: Bent Nitrosyl\nThe total valence electron count is calculated similarly, but with $\\mathrm{NO}$ as a $1$-electron donor:\n$$ \\text{TVE (bent)} = (\\text{electrons from } \\mathrm{Cr}) + (\\text{electrons from bent } \\mathrm{NO}) + 3 \\times (\\text{electrons from } \\mathrm{CO}) + (\\text{electrons from } \\mathrm{PMe_3}) $$\n$$ \\text{TVE (bent)} = 6 + 1 + 3 \\times 2 + 2 = 15 $$\nA complex with a $15$-electron count is even more electron-deficient.\n\nNext, we employ the ionic model to determine the oxidation state of chromium and its $d$-electron count for each case. This model is a formalism that is also essential for determining the Enemark–Feltham index, $n$.\n\nIonic Case 1: Linear Nitrosyl (formally $\\mathrm{NO}^+$)\nIn this formalism, the ligands are assigned charges to represent them as closed-shell species. The linear nitrosyl is represented as the nitrosonium cation, $\\mathrm{NO}^+$, which is an $L$-type $2$-electron donor. The other ligands, $\\mathrm{CO}$ and $\\mathrm{PMe_3}$, are neutral, $L$-type $2$-electron donors. The overall complex is neutral. To find the oxidation state, $q$, of chromium, we balance the charges:\n$$ q_{\\mathrm{Cr}} + q_{\\mathrm{NO}} + 3 \\times q_{\\mathrm{CO}} + q_{\\mathrm{PMe_3}} = 0 $$\n$$ q + (+1) + 3 \\times (0) + (0) = 0 \\implies q = -1 $$\nThus, chromium is in the oxidation state of $-I$. For a Group $6$ element, the $d$-electron count is given by (Group Number) - (Oxidation State) = $6 - (-1) = 7$. The metal center is $d^7$.\n\nIonic Case 2: Bent Nitrosyl (formally $\\mathrm{NO}^-$)\nThe bent nitrosyl is represented as the nitroxyl anion, $\\mathrm{NO}^-$. This is an $X$-type ligand, contributing $2$ electrons. To find the oxidation state of chromium, we again balance the charges:\n$$ q_{\\mathrm{Cr}} + q_{\\mathrm{NO}} + 3 \\times q_{\\mathrm{CO}} + q_{\\mathrm{PMe_3}} = 0 $$\n$$ q + (-1) + 3 \\times (0) + (0) = 0 \\implies q = +1 $$\nThus, chromium is in the oxidation state of $+I$. The $d$-electron count is (Group Number) - (Oxidation State) = $6 - (1) = 5$. The metal center is $d^5$.\n\nNow we can determine the Enemark–Feltham index, $n$, for the $\\{\\mathrm{MNO}\\}^n$ unit. The index $n$ is defined as the sum of the metal $d$ electrons and the electrons in the $\\pi^*$ molecular orbitals of the nitrosyl ligand. This notation provides an unambiguous description of the metal-nitrosyl fragment, independent of the choice of linear or bent formalism.\n\nFor $\\{\\mathrm{CrNO}\\}^n$ in the linear ($\\mathrm{NO}^+$) case:\nThe metal is $\\mathrm{Cr}(-I)$, which is $d^7$. The ligand is $\\mathrm{NO}^+$, which is isoelectronic with $\\mathrm{N_2}$ and $\\mathrm{CO}$ and has $10$ valence electrons. Its molecular orbital diagram shows that the $\\pi^*$ orbitals are empty.\n$$ n = (\\text{metal } d \\text{ electrons}) + (\\mathrm{NO}\\ \\pi^* \\text{ electrons}) $$\n$$ n = 7 + 0 = 7 $$\n\nFor $\\{\\mathrm{CrNO}\\}^n$ in the bent ($\\mathrm{NO}^-$) case:\nThe metal is $\\mathrm{Cr}(+I)$, which is $d^5$. The ligand is $\\mathrm{NO}^-$, which has $12$ valence electrons. Its molecular orbital diagram shows two electrons in the $\\pi^*$ orbitals.\n$$ n = (\\text{metal } d \\text{ electrons}) + (\\mathrm{NO}\\ \\pi^* \\text{ electrons}) $$\n$$ n = 5 + 2 = 7 $$\nAs expected, the Enemark–Feltham index $n$ is identical in both formalisms, yielding a $\\{\\mathrm{CrNO}\\}^7$ system. This confirms the internal consistency of our analysis.\n\nFinally, we rationalize the more plausible geometry using the Hard and Soft Acids and Bases (HSAB) concept.\nThe ancillary ligands, $\\mathrm{CO}$ (a strong $\\pi$-acceptor) and $\\mathrm{PMe_3}$ (a phosphine with a $\\sigma$-donating alkyl group), are both classified as soft bases.\nIn the linear $\\mathrm{NO}$ formalism, the metal center is $\\mathrm{Cr}(-I)$. A metal in a very low or negative oxidation state is electron-rich and is therefore a very soft acid.\nIn the bent $\\mathrm{NO}$ formalism, the metal center is $\\mathrm{Cr}(+I)$. A metal in a low positive oxidation state is less electron-rich and is therefore a harder acid compared to its negative-oxidation-state counterpart, although it is still relatively soft.\nThe HSAB principle dictates that soft acids prefer to bind to soft bases. The combination of a very soft $\\mathrm{Cr}(-I)$ center with the soft ligands $\\mathrm{CO}$ and $\\mathrm{PMe_3}$ represents a more favorable soft-soft interaction than the combination of the relatively harder $\\mathrm{Cr}(+I)$ center with these same ligands.\nFurthermore, the covalent model electron count for the linear geometry is $16e^-$, which is significantly closer to the stable $18e^-$ configuration than the $15e^-$ count for the bent geometry. A $16e^-$ count is common for $5$-coordinate species preferring a square-pyramidal geometry. Therefore, based on both electronic stability (proximity to $18e^-$) and HSAB principles, the linear nitrosyl geometry is the more plausible description.\n\nThe question asks for the Enemark–Feltham index $n$, which we have uniquely determined to be $7$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{7}\n$$", "id": "2948939"}]}
