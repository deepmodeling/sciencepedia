Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nWe begin by determining the electron configurations and total energies for the high-spin and low-spin cases for a $d^6$ octahedral complex. The total energy, $E$, is the sum of the Crystal Field Stabilization Energy (CFSE) and the total pairing energy.\n\n1.  **High-Spin ($HS$) Configuration**\n    For a $d^6$ configuration, to maximize spin multiplicity (Hund's rule), electrons are placed singly in all five $d$-orbitals ($t_{2g}$ and $e_g$) before any pairing occurs. The sixth electron then pairs up in one of the lower-energy $t_{2g}$ orbitals.\n    - The electronic configuration is $(t_{2g})^4(e_g)^2$.\n    - There are $4$ electrons in the $t_{2g}$ orbitals and $2$ electrons in the $e_g$ orbitals.\n    - The CFSE for the high-spin case is calculated as:\n      $$\n      \\text{CFSE}_{HS} = (4 \\times -0.4\\,\\Delta_o) + (2 \\times +0.6\\,\\Delta_o) = -1.6\\,\\Delta_o + 1.2\\,\\Delta_o = -0.4\\,\\Delta_o\n      $$\n    - In this configuration, there is one pair of electrons in one of the $t_{2g}$ orbitals. According to the problem definition, this contributes an energy of $1 \\times P$.\n    - The total electronic energy for the high-spin case, $E_{HS}$, is:\n      $$\n      E_{HS} = \\text{CFSE}_{HS} + \\text{Pairing Energy} = -0.4\\,\\Delta_o + P\n      $$\n\n2.  **Low-Spin ($LS$) Configuration**\n    For the low-spin case, electrons fill the lowest energy orbitals available, which are the $t_{2g}$ orbitals, before occupying the higher-energy $e_g$ orbitals.\n    - All $6$ electrons occupy the $t_{2g}$ orbitals. The electronic configuration is $(t_{2g})^6(e_g)^0$.\n    - There are $6$ electrons in the $t_{2g}$ orbitals and $0$ electrons in the $e_g$ orbitals.\n    - The CFSE for the low-spin case is:\n      $$\n      \\text{CFSE}_{LS} = (6 \\times -0.4\\,\\Delta_o) + (0 \\times +0.6\\,\\Delta_o) = -2.4\\,\\Delta_o\n      $$\n    - In this configuration, the $6$ electrons form $3$ pairs within the three $t_{2g}$ orbitals. This contributes a total pairing energy of $3 \\times P$.\n    - The total electronic energy for the low-spin case, $E_{LS}$, is:\n      $$\n      E_{LS} = \\text{CFSE}_{LS} + \\text{Pairing Energy} = -2.4\\,\\Delta_o + 3P\n      $$\n\n3.  **Condition for Low-Spin Preference**\n    The low-spin configuration is energetically preferred when its total energy is less than that of the high-spin configuration, i.e., $E_{LS}  E_{HS}$.\n    - We set up the inequality:\n      $$\n      -2.4\\,\\Delta_o + 3P  -0.4\\,\\Delta_o + P\n      $$\n    - Rearranging the terms to solve for the relationship between $\\Delta_o$ and $P$:\n      $$\n      3P - P  -0.4\\,\\Delta_o + 2.4\\,\\Delta_o\n      $$\n      $$\n      2P  2.0\\,\\Delta_o\n      $$\n      $$\n      P  \\Delta_o\n      $$\n    - Thus, the low-spin configuration is favored when the octahedral splitting energy, $\\Delta_o$, is greater than the mean pairing energy, $P$.\n\n4.  **Determination of Spin State and Magnetic Moment**\n    We are given the values $\\Delta_o = 10000\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ and $P = 15000\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$.\n    - We test the condition for low-spin preference: Is $\\Delta_o  P$?\n    - Substituting the values: Is $10000\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}  15000\\ \\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$?\n    - The inequality is false. Since $\\Delta_o  P$, the system will adopt the configuration with the lower pairing energy cost, which is the high-spin configuration.\n    - The favored spin state is **high-spin**.\n    - The high-spin configuration is $(t_{2g})^4(e_g)^2$. The electron arrangement is $(\\uparrow\\downarrow \\uparrow \\uparrow)$ in the $t_{2g}$ orbitals and $(\\uparrow \\uparrow)$ in the $e_g$ orbitals.\n    - The number of unpaired electrons, $n$, is the sum of unpaired electrons in both sets of orbitals: $n = 2 (\\text{from } t_{2g}) + 2 (\\text{from } e_g) = 4$.\n    - The spin-only magnetic moment, $\\mu_{\\text{so}}$, is calculated using the formula:\n      $$\n      \\mu_{\\text{so}} = \\sqrt{n(n+2)}\\ \\mu_B\n      $$\n    - Substituting $n=4$:\n      $$\n      \\mu_{\\text{so}} = \\sqrt{4(4+2)}\\ \\mu_B = \\sqrt{4 \\times 6}\\ \\mu_B = \\sqrt{24}\\ \\mu_B\n      $$\n    - Now we compute the numerical value and round to $3$ significant figures:\n      $$\n      \\mu_{\\text{so}} \\approx 4.898979...\\ \\mu_B\n      $$\n      $$\n      \\mu_{\\text{so}} \\approx 4.90\\ \\mu_B\n      $$\nThe final required answer is the numerical value of the magnetic moment.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{4.90}\n$$", "id": "2921924"}, {"introduction": "Having explored the electronic structure of a single metal ion, we now scale up to the complex, multi-iron clusters that define nitrogenase function.

It represents a standard problem in enzyme kinetics, specifically the application of the steady-state assumption under a pre-equilibrium regime. All necessary data are provided, and the kinetic condition is verifiable and holds for the given parameters. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**, and we proceed with a rigorous derivation.\n\nThe overall catalytic rate, $v$, is determined by the turnover-limiting step, which is stated to be the binding of dinitrogen to the $E_4$ state. The rate expression is thus:\n$$v = k_{\\mathrm{bind}}[\\mathrm{N}_2][E_4]$$\nOur task is to find the steady-state concentration of the species $E_4$, denoted $[E_4]$.\n\nThe problem specifies a kinetic regime where the rate of dinitrogen binding is much slower than the interconversion rates between the states $E_0$ through $E_4$. This is articulated as $k_{\\mathrm{bind}}[\\mathrm{N}_2] \\ll k_i^{+}, k_i^{-}$ for $i \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$. This condition implies that the forward and reverse reactions for each step $E_i \\rightleftharpoons E_{i+1}$ are much faster than the rate at which $E_4$ is consumed. Consequently, a pre-equilibrium is established among the states $E_0, E_1, E_2, E_3,$ and $E_4$.\n\nUnder this pre-equilibrium approximation, the net flux between adjacent states is negligible compared to their individual forward and reverse fluxes. At steady state, the net flux $v$ must be constant through the reaction sequence. For any step $i \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$, we have $v = k_i^{+}[E_i] - k_i^{-}[E_{i+1}]$. Since $v$ corresponds to the slow step, $k_{\\mathrm{bind}}[\\mathrm{N}_2][E_4]$, it is much smaller than $k_i^{+}[E_i]$ or $k_i^{-}[E_{i+1}]$. Thus, we can approximate $k_i^{+}[E_i] - k_i^{-}[E_{i+1]} \\approx 0$, which leads to:\n$$k_i^{+}[E_i] \\approx k_i^{-}[E_{i+1}]$$\nFrom this approximation, we define an equilibrium constant, $K_i$, for each of the first four steps:\n$$K_i = \\frac{k_i^{+}}{k_i^{-}} = \\frac{[E_{i+1}]}{[E_i]} \\quad \\text{for } i \\in \\{0, 1, 2, 3\\}$$\nThis allows us to express the concentration of each state $E_j$ in terms of the concentration of the initial state, $[E_0]$:\n$$[E_1] = K_0[E_0]$$\n$$[E_2] = K_1[E_1] = K_1 K_0[E_0]$$\n$$[E_3] = K_2[E_2] = K_2 K_1 K_0[E_0]$$\n$$[E_4] = K_3[E_3] = K_3 K_2 K_1 K_0[E_0]$$\nIn general, for $j  0$, we can write:\n$$[E_j] = \\left(\\prod_{l=0}^{j-1} K_l\\right) [E_0]$$\nThe total enzyme concentration, $[E_{\\mathrm{tot}}]$, is conserved:\n$$[E_{\\mathrm{tot}}] = \\sum_{j=0}^{4} [E_j] = [E_0] + [E_1] + [E_2] + [E_3] + [E_4]$$\nSubstituting the expressions in terms of $[E_0]$:\n$$[E_{\\mathrm{tot}}] = [E_0] \\left(1 + K_0 + K_0 K_1 + K_0 K_1 K_2 + K_0 K_1 K_2 K_3\\right)$$\nFor conciseness, we define a term $P_j$ proportional to the population of state $E_j$:\n$P_0 = 1$\n$P_j = \\prod_{l=0}^{j-1} K_l$ for $j \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$.\nThen, $[E_j] = P_j [E_0]$.

The relative population of state $E_j$ is proportional to $P_j$. We compute these values:\n$P_0 = 1$\n$P_1 = K_0 = 10$\n$P_2 = K_0 K_1 = 10 \\times 5 = 50$\n$P_3 = P_2 K_2 = 50 \\times 2 = 100$\n$P_4 = P_3 K_3 = 100 \\times 0.5 = 50$\nThe set of relative populations is $\\{1, 10, 50, 100, 50\\}$.
