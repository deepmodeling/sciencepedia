The information provided is sufficient for a complete and unique solution.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three stages as requested: determining the stoichiometric formula of the salt, identifying the composition of its coordination and outer spheres, and calculating the ionic strength of its aqueous solution.\n\n**Part 1: Stoichiometric Formula of the Salt**\n\nThe name of the salt is tris(ethylenediamine)cobalt(III) sulfate. We decipher this name according to IUPAC nomenclature rules for coordination compounds.\n\n1.  **Central Metal and Oxidation State**: The name `cobalt(III)` indicates the central metal is cobalt, symbol $Co$. The Roman numeral $(III)$ specifies its oxidation state is $+3$.\n\n2.  **Ligands**: The ligand is `ethylenediamine`, a neutral bidentate ligand, commonly abbreviated as $en$. The prefix `tris-` indicates that there are three ethylenediamine ligands coordinated to the central metal. Since ethylenediamine is a neutral molecule, its charge is $0$.\n\n3.  **Complex Ion Formula and Charge**: The part of the name `tris(ethylenediamine)cobalt(III)` describes the complex cation. The formula is written by placing the metal symbol first, followed by the ligand formulas, all enclosed in square brackets. Thus, the complex ion is $[Co(en)_3]$. The charge of this complex ion is the sum of the oxidation state of the central metal and the charges of the ligands.\n    $$\n    \\text{Charge of complex ion} = (\\text{oxidation state of } Co) + 3 \\times (\\text{charge of } en)\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\text{Charge of complex ion} = (+3) + 3 \\times (0) = +3\n    $$\n    So, the complex cation is $[Co(en)_3]^{3+}$.\n\n4.  **Counterion**: The name `sulfate` indicates that the counterion (the anion) is the sulfate ion, which has the formula $SO_4^{2-}$ and a charge of $-2$.\n\n5.  **Salt Formula**: The salt is an ionic compound formed from the cation $[Co(en)_3]^{3+}$ and the anion $SO_4^{2-}$. For the overall compound to be electrically neutral, the total positive charge must balance the total negative charge. Let the simplest integer stoichiometric formula be $([Co(en)_3])_x(SO_4)_y$. The charge balance equation is:\n    $$\n    x \\cdot (+3) + y \\cdot (-2) = 0 \\implies 3x = 2y\n    $$\n    The smallest positive integers $x$ and $y$ that satisfy this equation are $x=2$ and $y=3$. Therefore, the simplest integer stoichiometric formula of the salt is $([Co(en)_3])_2(SO_4)_3$.\n\n**Part 2: Composition of Coordination and Outer Spheres**\n\nPer one formula unit, $([Co(en)_3])_2(SO_4)_3$:\n\n-   **Coordination Sphere**: The coordination sphere consists of the central metal ion and the ligands directly bonded to it, enclosed in the square brackets. In this formula unit, there are two such units. The composition of the coordination sphere is therefore two $[Co(en)_3]^{3+}$ complex cations.\n-   **Outer Sphere**: The outer sphere consists of the counterions that are not directly bonded to the central metal but are present in the crystal lattice to ensure charge neutrality. In this formula unit, the outer sphere is composed of three $SO_4^{2-}$ sulfate anions.\n\n**Part 3: Calculation of Ionic Strength**\n\nThe salt $([Co(en)_3])_2(SO_4)_3$ is stated to dissociate completely in an aqueous solution. The dissociation reaction is:\n$$\n([Co(en)_3])_2(SO_4)_3(s) \\xrightarrow{H_2O} 2 [Co(en)_3]^{3+}(aq) + 3 SO_4^{2-}(aq)\n$$\nThe formal molarity of the salt is given as $c_0 = 2.50 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{mol \\ L^{-1}}$. Due to the stoichiometry of the dissociation:\n\n-   The molar concentration of the complex cation, $c_{cat} = c_{[Co(en)_3]^{3+}}$, is $2c_0$.\n-   The molar concentration of the sulfate anion, $c_{an} = c_{SO_4^{2-}}$, is $3c_0$.\n\nThe ionic strength, $I$, is defined as:\n$$\nI = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i} c_i z_i^2\n$$\nFor this solution, the sum is over the two ionic species present: the cation $[Co(en)_3]^{3+}$ and the anion $SO_4^{2-}$.\n\n-   For the cation: concentration $c_{cat} = 2c_0$, charge $z_{cat} = +3$.\n-   For the anion: concentration $c_{an} = 3c_0$, charge $z_{an} = -2$.\n\nSubstituting these into the ionic strength formula:\n$$\nI = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( c_{cat} z_{cat}^2 + c_{an} z_{an}^2 \\right)\n$$\n$$\nI = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( (2c_0)(+3)^2 + (3c_0)(-2)^2 \\right)\n$$\n$$\nI = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 2c_0(9) + 3c_0(4) \\right)\n$$\n$$\nI = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( 18c_0 + 12c_0 \\right)\n$$\n$$\nI = \\frac{1}{2} (30c_0) = 15c_0\n$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical value for $c_0$:\n$$\nc_0 = 2.50 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{mol \\ L^{-1}}\n$$\n$$\nI = 15 \\times (2.50 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{mol \\ L^{-1}})\n$$\n$$\nI = 37.5 \\times 10^{-3} \\ \\mathrm{mol \\ L^{-1}}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be in standard scientific notation and rounded to three significant figures, which is consistent with the precision of the given concentration.\n$$\nI = 3.75 \\times 10^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{mol \\ L^{-1}}\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3.75 \\times 10^{-2}}$$", "id": "2930558"}, {"introduction": "Building upon the concept of a single, well-defined structure, this exercise explores the fascinating world of isomerism, where a single molecular formula can correspond to multiple distinct chemical species.

The properties of $\\mathrm{Pd}^{2+}$, such as its common $+2$ oxidation state, $d^{8}$ electron configuration, and preference for square planar geometry, are textbook facts.

A solution will be derived.\n\n**ANALYSIS AND SOLUTION**\n\nThe problem requires a systematic enumeration of all possible isomers for the complex $[\\mathrm{PdCl}_{2}(\\mathrm{tu})_{2}]$. The isomerism in this system arises from two distinct sources:\n$1$. **Linkage Isomerism**: The ambidentate nature of the thiourea ($\\mathrm{tu}$) ligand, which can coordinate either through its sulfur atom ($\\mathrm{tu}\\text{-}\\kappa S$) or a nitrogen atom ($\\mathrm{tu}\\text{-}\\kappa N$).\n$2$. **Geometric Isomerism**: The different spatial arrangements of the ligands around the square planar $\\mathrm{Pd}^{2+}$ center, specifically `cis` and `trans` configurations.\n\nWe will analyze the problem by first considering the possible combinations of linkage isomers for the two thiourea ligands, and then, for each combination, determining the number of possible geometric isomers. Let the two chloride ligands be denoted by $\\text{A}$ and the two thiourea ligands by $\\text{L}_1$ and $\\text{L}_2$. The complex is of the form $[\\text{PdA}_2\\text{L}_1\\text{L}_2]$.\n\nThere are three distinct compositional possibilities based on the donor atoms of the two thiourea ligands:\n\n**Case 1: Both thiourea ligands coordinate through the sulfur atom.**\nIn this case, the formula of the complex is $[\\mathrm{PdCl}_{2}(\\mathrm{tu}\\text{-}\\kappa S)_{2}]$. This corresponds to a general formula of the type $\\mathrm{MA}_{2}\\mathrm{B}_{2}$, where $\\mathrm{M} = \\mathrm{Pd}$, $\\mathrm{A} = \\mathrm{Cl}$, and $\\mathrm{B} = \\mathrm{tu}\\text{-}\\kappa S$. For a square planar geometry, a complex of the type $\\mathrm{MA}_{2}\\mathrm{B}_{2}$ can exist as two distinct geometric isomers:\n-   `cis` isomer: The two chloride ligands are adjacent to each other (at a $90^\\circ$ angle).\n-   `trans` isomer: The two chloride ligands are opposite to each other (at a $180^\\circ$ angle).\nThese two isomers are structurally distinct and will have unique IUPAC names (`cis-dichloridobis(thiourea-\\kappa S)palladium(II)` and `trans-dichloridobis(thiourea-\\kappa S)palladium(II)`).\nThus, this case contributes $2$ distinct species.\n\n**Case 2: Both thiourea ligands coordinate through a nitrogen atom.**\nIn this case, a parallel analysis applies. The formula is $[\\mathrm{PdCl}_{2}(\\mathrm{tu}\\text{-}\\kappa N)_{2}]$. This is also of the type $\\mathrm{MA}_{2}\\mathrm{B}_{2}$, where $\\mathrm{M} = \\mathrm{Pd}$, $\\mathrm{A} = \\mathrm{Cl}$, and $\\mathrm{B} = \\mathrm{tu}\\text{-}\\kappa N$. As in the previous case, two geometric isomers exist for this composition:\n-   `cis` isomer.\n-   `trans` isomer.\nThese two isomers are distinct from each other and from the isomers in Case 1. The corresponding IUPAC names would be `cis-dichloridobis(thiourea-\\kappa N)palladium(II)` and `trans-dichloridobis(thiourea-\\kappa N)palladium(II)`.\nThis case also contributes $2$ distinct species.\n\n**Case 3: One thiourea ligand coordinates through sulfur, and the other through nitrogen.**\nThe formula of the complex is $[\\mathrm{PdCl}_{2}(\\mathrm{tu}\\text{-}\\kappa S)(\\mathrm{tu}\\text{-}\\kappa N)]$. This corresponds to a general formula of the type $\\mathrm{MA}_{2}\\mathrm{BC}$, where $\\mathrm{M} = \\mathrm{Pd}$, $\\mathrm{A} = \\mathrm{Cl}$, $\\mathrm{B} = \\mathrm{tu}\\text{-}\\kappa S$, and $\\mathrm{C} = \\mathrm{tu}\\text{-}\\kappa N$. For a square planar complex of this type, geometric isomerism is determined by the relative positions of the two identical ligands, $\\mathrm{A}$ (the chloride ligands).\n-   `cis` isomer: The two chloride ligands are adjacent. The remaining two positions are occupied by the $\\mathrm{tu}\\text{-}\\kappa S$ and $\\mathrm{tu}\\text{-}\\kappa N$ ligands. Since $\\mathrm{B}$ and $\\mathrm{C}$ are different, their relative positions are fixed in this arrangement.\n-   `trans` isomer: The two chloride ligands are opposite. The remaining two opposite positions are occupied by the $\\mathrm{tu}\\text{-}\\kappa S$ and $\\mathrm{tu}\\text{-}\\kappa N$ ligands.\nThese two isomers are structurally distinct and thus represent two unique species which require unique IUPAC names.\nThis case contributes another $2$ distinct species.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nTo find the total number of distinct species, we sum the number of isomers from each of the three mutually exclusive cases:\n-   Case 1 ($2 \\times \\mathrm{tu}\\text{-}\\kappa S$): $2$ isomers.\n-   Case 2 ($2 \\times \\mathrm{tu}\\text{-}\\kappa N$): $2$ isomers.\n-   Case 3 ($1 \\times \\mathrm{tu}\\text{-}\\kappa S$, $1 \\times \\mathrm{tu}\\text{-}\\kappa N$): $2$ isomers.\n\nThe total number of distinct species is the sum of the counts from these cases:\nTotal number = $2 + 2 + 2 = 6$.\n\nEach of these $6$ isomers is structurally unique and therefore requires a distinct and unambiguous IUPAC name to be fully described.
