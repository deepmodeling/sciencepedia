The dispersion relation for electrons is given by\n$$E(\\mathbf{k}) = -2t\\left[\\cos(k_x a) + \\cos(k_y a)\\right]$$\nwhere $t > 0$ is the nearest-neighbor hopping amplitude and $\\mathbf{k} = (k_x, k_y)$ is the wave vector. The first Brillouin zone (BZ) is defined by $k_x, k_y \\in [-\\pi/a, \\pi/a]$. The system is a noninteracting, spin-degenerate electron gas at zero temperature, $T=0 \\, \\mathrm{K}$.\n\nThe first task is to determine the Fermi contour at half-filling. Half-filling is defined as one electron per lattice site on average. Let $N$ be the number of lattice sites. The number of electrons is therefore $N_e = N$. The number of distinct $\\mathbf{k}$-vectors in the first BZ is also equal to $N$. Due to spin degeneracy, each $\\mathbf{k}$-state can accommodate $2$ electrons. Thus, the total number of available electronic states in the band is $2N$. At half-filling ($N_e=N$), precisely half of these states must be occupied. At $T=0 \\, \\mathrm{K}$, all states with energy $E(\\mathbf{k})$ less than or equal to the chemical potential $\\mu$ are filled. This means the number of filled $\\mathbf{k}$-states (for a given spin) must be $N/2$, which corresponds to filling half the area of the first BZ.\n\nWe identify the chemical potential $\\mu$ by analyzing the symmetries of the dispersion $E(\\mathbf{k})$. The energy spectrum ranges from $E_{min} = E(0,0) = -4t$ to $E_{max} = E(\\pi/a, \\pi/a) = 4t$. The dispersion exhibits particle-hole symmetry. Consider a shift in $\\mathbf{k}$-space by the vector $\\mathbf{Q}_M = (\\pi/a, \\pi/a)$, which connects the center of the BZ to a corner. The energy of the shifted state is:\n$$ E(\\mathbf{k} + \\mathbf{Q}_M) = -2t \\left[ \\cos(k_x a + \\pi) + \\cos(k_y a + \\pi) \\right] $$\n$$ E(\\mathbf{k} + \\mathbf{Q}_M) = -2t \\left[ -\\cos(k_x a) - \\cos(k_y a) \\right] = -E(\\mathbf{k}) $$\nThis relation $E(\\mathbf{k} + \\mathbf{Q}_M) = -E(\\mathbf{k})$ implies that for every state with energy $E$, there is a corresponding state with energy $-E$. Consequently, the density of states $D(E)$ is symmetric about $E=0$, i.e., $D(E)=D(-E)$. To fill exactly half of the total states, the Fermi level must be at the center of symmetry of the density of states. Therefore, at half-filling, the chemical potential is $\\mu = 0$.\n\nThe Fermi contour is defined by the equation $E(\\mathbf{k}) = \\mu$. Substituting $\\mu = 0$, we obtain the equation for the Fermi contour:\n$$ -2t\\left[\\cos(k_x a) + \\cos(k_y a)\\right] = 0 $$\nSince $t>0$, this simplifies to:\n$$ \\cos(k_x a) + \\cos(k_y a) = 0 $$\nThis equation describes the boundary between occupied and unoccupied states in the BZ. The Fermi contour is a square rotated by $45$ degrees, with vertices at the midpoints of the BZ edges: $(\\pi/a, 0)$, $(0, \\pi/a)$, $(-\\pi/a, 0)$, and $(0, -\\pi/a)$.\n\nThe second task is to find the smallest-magnitude nonzero perfect nesting vector $\\mathbf{Q}$. A vector $\\mathbf{Q}$ perfectly nests the Fermi contour if, for every point $\\mathbf{k}$ on the contour, the point $\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}$ (modulo a reciprocal lattice vector) is also on the contour. That is, if $E(\\mathbf{k})=0$, then $E(\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q})=0$.\n\nWe seek a vector $\\mathbf{Q} = (Q_x, Q_y)$ that satisfies this condition for all points on the Fermi surface. A sufficient condition for this is the stronger property $E(\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}) = -E(\\mathbf{k})$, which we have already established for $\\mathbf{Q}_M = (\\pi/a, \\pi/a)$. If this property holds for all $\\mathbf{k}$, then for any $\\mathbf{k}$ on the Fermi surface where $E(\\mathbf{k})=0$, it follows that $E(\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}) = -0 = 0$, so $\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}$ is also on the Fermi surface.\n\nLet us verify this with $\\mathbf{Q} = (\\pi/a, \\pi/a)$. We check if $\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}$ lies on the Fermi contour when $\\mathbf{k}$ does. The condition for the translated point $\\mathbf{k}' = \\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}$ is $\\cos(k'_x a) + \\cos(k'_y a) = 0$.\n$$ \\cos((k_x+\\pi/a)a) + \\cos((k_y+\\pi/a)a) = \\cos(k_x a + \\pi) + \\cos(k_y a + \\pi) $$\n$$ = -\\cos(k_x a) - \\cos(k_y a) = -(\\cos(k_x a) + \\cos(k_y a)) $$\nGiven that $\\mathbf{k}$ is on the Fermi contour, $\\cos(k_x a) + \\cos(k_y a) = 0$. Thus, the expression above evaluates to $0$, confirming that $\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}$ is also on the Fermi contour. This holds for any point $\\mathbf{k}$ on the contour, so $\\mathbf{Q} = (\\pi/a, \\pi/a)$ is a perfect nesting vector.\n\nTo determine if this is the smallest-magnitude nonzero nesting vector, we can generalize the condition $E(\\mathbf{k}+\\mathbf{Q}) = -E(\\mathbf{k})$. This requires\n$$ \\cos(k_x a + Q_x a) + \\cos(k_y a + Q_y a) = -(\\cos(k_x a) + \\cos(k_y a)) $$\nFor this identity to hold for all $\\mathbf{k}$, the coefficients of the basis functions $\\cos(k_x a)$, $\\sin(k_x a)$, etc., must match. This leads to the requirements: $\\cos(Q_x a) = -1$ and $\\sin(Q_x a) = 0$, which implies $Q_x a = (2n+1)\\pi$ for some integer $n$. Similarly, $Q_y a = (2m+1)\\pi$ for some integer $m$.\nThe components of the nesting vector must be of the form $Q_x = (2n+1)\\pi/a$ and $Q_y = (2m+1)\\pi/a$.\nThe smallest-magnitude nonzero vectors are obtained when the integers $n$ and $m$ are chosen such that $|2n+1|=1$ and $|2m+1|=1$.
