The problem of finding the extraction pressure reduces to a one-dimensional root-finding task: find $P$ in the admissible supercritical interval $[P_\\text{min},P_\\text{max}]$ such that $F(P;T,y_i)=0$.\n\nA robust numerical approach is to use a bracketing method, such as bisection, which requires a sign change of $F$ over the interval. The algorithm is as follows:\n- For each test case $\\left(T,y_i\\right)$, compute $F(P_\\text{min})$ and $F(P_\\text{max})$.\n- If $F(P_\\text{min})\\cdot F(P_\\text{max})0$, then no root exists in the interval and the physically admissible supercritical solution does not exist under these constraints; report the sentinel $-1.0$.\n- Otherwise, iterate bisection on $[P_\\text{min},P_\\text{max}]$ until the interval is sufficiently small or the residual is sufficiently close to zero, and return the midpoint as the extraction pressure. The returned value is then rounded to three decimals in $\\mathrm{MPa}$, as required.\n\nParameter values used:\n- $A=23.0$ and $B=6000.0$ for the Clausius–Clapeyron relation.\n- $v_i^\\mathrm{s}=4.0\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{m^3\\,mol^{-1}}$.\n- $R=8.314462618\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$.\n- $\\left(a,b,c\\right)$ at $T=308.0\\,\\mathrm{K}$ equals $\\left(3.0,\\,0.80,\\,-0.005\\right)$, at $T=328.0\\,\\mathrm{K}$ equals $\\left(2.0,\\,0.45,\\,-0.003\\right)$, and at $T=348.0\\,\\mathrm{K}$ equals $\\left(1.5,\\,0.30,\\,-0.002\\right)$; linear interpolation supplies $\\left(a(T),b(T),c(T)\\right)$ for intermediate $T$.\n- $k_0=-1.0$, $k_T=-500.0\\,\\mathrm{K}$, and $k_\\rho=-0.03\\,\\mathrm{L\\,mol^{-1}}$.\n- $P_\\text{min}=7.5\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$ and $P_\\text{max}=60.0\\,\\mathrm{MPa}$.\n\nThe algorithm directly enforces the equality $f_i^\\mathrm{fluid}=f_i^\\mathrm{solid}$ from first principles, while using physically plausible, interpolated density isotherms and an empirically motivated infinite-dilution fugacity coefficient. The Poynting correction is applied consistently with the chosen solid molar volume and absolute units. The test suite includes three cases expected to have a unique solution in the supercritical region and one edge case designed to have no solution in the admissible interval, thus testing both the happy path and the sentinel behavior. The final program aggregates results in the specified single-line list format, with each successful extraction pressure expressed in $\\mathrm{MPa}$ rounded to three decimals.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport math\n\n# Constants\nR = 8.314462618  # J/mol/K\nv_s = 4.0e-5     # m^3/mol\nPc_MPa = 7.3773  # MPa\nPmin = 7.5       # MPa (enforce supercritical)\nPmax = 60.0      # MPa\n\n# Sublimation vapor pressure parameters (Clausius–Clapeyron), returns Pa\nA_sub = 23.0\nB_sub = 6000.0\n\n# Fugacity coefficient correlation parameters: ln(phi) = k0 + kT/T + k_rho * rho\nk0 = -1.0\nkT = -500.0\nk_rho = -0.03  # per (mol/L)\n\n# Density isotherm coefficients at T nodes (T in K): rho(P,T)=a(T)+b(T)P+c(T)P^2 with P in MPa, rho in mol/L\nisotherm_data = [\n    (308.0, (3.0, 0.80, -0.005)),\n    (328.0, (2.0, 0.45, -0.003)),\n    (348.0, (1.5, 0.30, -0.002)),\n]\n\ndef p_sub_pa(T):\n    # p_sub in Pa\n    return math.exp(A_sub - B_sub / T)\n\ndef interp_coeffs(T):\n    # Linear interpolation of (a,b,c) over T using two nearest nodes\n    # Extrapolate linearly if outside provided range.\n    # Sort by temperature\n    data = sorted(isotherm_data, key=lambda x: x[0])\n    if T = data[0][0]:\n        return data[0][1]\n    if T = data[-1][0]:\n        return data[-1][1]\n    # Find interval\n    for i in range(len(data) - 1):\n        T0, (a0, b0, c0) = data[i]\n        T1, (a1, b1, c1) = data[i + 1]\n        if T0 = T = T1:\n            f = (T - T0) / (T1 - T0)\n            a = a0 + f * (a1 - a0)\n            b = b0 + f * (b1 - b0)\n            c = c0 + f * (c1 - c0)\n            return (a, b, c)\n    # Fallback (should not reach here)\n    return data[-1][1]\n\ndef rho_mol_per_L(P_MPa, T):\n    a, b, c = interp_coeffs(T)\n    return a + b * P_MPa + c * (P_MPa ** 2)\n\ndef phi_infinite_dilution(T, rho_mol_L):\n    ln_phi = k0 + (kT / T) + k_rho * rho_mol_L\n    # Ensure numerical stability\n    return math.exp(ln_phi)\n\ndef residual(P_MPa, T, y):\n    # Convert P to Pa where needed\n    P_Pa = P_MPa * 1.0e6\n    rho = rho_mol_per_L(P_MPa, T)\n    phi = phi_infinite_dilution(T, rho)\n    f_fluid = y * phi * P_Pa\n    f_solid = p_sub_pa(T) * math.exp((v_s * P_Pa) / (R * T))\n    return f_fluid - f_solid\n\ndef find_pressure(T, y, P_lo=Pmin, P_hi=Pmax, tol=1e-9, max_iter=200):\n    f_lo = residual(P_lo, T, y)\n    f_hi = residual(P_hi, T, y)\n    if math.isnan(f_lo) or math.isnan(f_hi):\n        return -1.0\n    # If no sign change, declare no solution in bracket\n    if f_lo == 0.0:\n        return P_lo\n    if f_hi == 0.0:\n        return P_hi\n    if f_lo * f_hi  0.0:\n        return -1.0\n    # Bisection\n    a = P_lo\n    b = P_hi\n    fa = f_lo\n    fb = f_hi\n    for _ in range(max_iter):\n        m = 0.5 * (a + b)\n        fm = residual(m, T, y)\n        # Check convergence either by residual or interval\n        if abs(fm)  1e-6:\n            return m\n        if (b - a)  tol:\n            return m\n        # Update bracket\n        if fa * fm = 0.0:\n            b = m\n            fb = fm\n        else:\n            a = m\n            fa = fm\n    return 0.5 * (a + b)\n\ndef solve():\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each case: (T in K, y dimensionless)\n    test_cases = [\n        (318.0, 1.0e-4),\n        (338.0, 1.7e-4),\n        (308.5, 6.0e-5),\n        (348.0, 2.0e-5),\n    ]\n\n    results_str = []\n    for T, y in test_cases:\n        P = find_pressure(T, y, P_lo=Pmin, P_hi=Pmax)\n        if P  0.0:\n            results_str.append(str(-1.0))\n        else:\n            results_str.append(f\"{P:.3f}\")\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    print(f\"[{','.join(results_str)}]\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve()\n```", "id": "2931981"}]}
