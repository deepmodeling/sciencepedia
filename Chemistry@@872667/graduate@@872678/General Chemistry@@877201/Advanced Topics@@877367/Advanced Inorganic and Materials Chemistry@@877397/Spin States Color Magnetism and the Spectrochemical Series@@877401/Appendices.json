It provides a self-contained and consistent set of conditions for a standard calculation in coordination chemistry. There are no identifiable flaws; therefore, I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem concerns a transition metal complex with a $d^{1}$ electron configuration in an octahedral ligand field. In such a field, the five degenerate $d$-orbitals split into a lower-energy triply degenerate set, labeled $t_{2g}$, and a higher-energy doubly degenerate set, labeled $e_g$. The energy separation between these two sets is, by definition, the octahedral crystal field splitting parameter, $\\Delta_o$.\n\nFor a $d^{1}$ ion, the ground electronic state corresponds to the configuration $t_{2g}^{1}$, which has the term symbol $^{2}T_{2g}$. The problem states that a single intense absorption is observed, which is treated as the lowest-energy, spin-allowed transition. This transition corresponds to the promotion of the single electron from a $t_{2g}$ orbital to an $e_g$ orbital, resulting in the excited electronic state $e_g^{1}$, with term symbol $^{2}E_g$. For a single-electron system, the energy difference between the ground state and this first excited state is exactly equal to $\\Delta_o$, as there are no interelectronic repulsion terms to consider.\n$$ \\Delta E_{\\text{transition}} = E(^{2}E_g) - E(^{2}T_{2g}) = \\Delta_o $$\nThis energy, $\\Delta E$, corresponds to the energy of the photon absorbed at the maximum of the absorption band, $\\lambda_{\\max}$. The energy of a photon is related to its wavelength, $\\lambda$, and its wavenumber, $\\bar{\\nu}$, through the Planck-Einstein relation:\n$$ \\Delta E = h \\nu = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} $$\nwhere $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\\nu$ is the frequency. Wavenumber is defined as the reciprocal of the wavelength, $\\bar{\\nu} = 1/\\lambda$. It is a unit of frequency divided by the speed of light, and is commonly expressed in units of reciprocal centimeters, $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. Thus, energy can be expressed as being directly proportional to wavenumber:\n$$ \\Delta E = hc\\bar{\\nu} $$\nFrom these relations, the crystal field splitting parameter $\\Delta_o$ can be directly identified with the wavenumber of the absorbed light, $\\bar{\\nu}_{\\max}$, corresponding to $\\lambda_{\\max}$.\n$$ \\Delta_o\\ (\\text{in}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}) = \\bar{\\nu}_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\max}} $$\nThe problem provides the value $\\lambda_{\\max} = 600\\ \\mathrm{nm}$. To calculate $\\Delta_o$ in units of $\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, the wavelength must be converted from nanometers ($\\mathrm{nm}$) to centimeters ($\\mathrm{cm}$). The conversion factors are $1\\ \\mathrm{nm} = 10^{-9}\\ \\mathrm{m}$ and $1\\ \\mathrm{m} = 100\\ \\mathrm{cm} = 10^{2}\\ \\mathrm{cm}$. Therefore:\n$$ \\lambda_{\\max} = 600\\ \\mathrm{nm} = 600 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{cm} = 6.00 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{cm} $$\nNow, we can compute the value of $\\Delta_o$:\n$$ \\Delta_o = \\frac{1}{6.00 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\mathrm{cm}} = \\frac{10^{5}}{6.00}\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1} \\approx 16666.67\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1} $$\nThe problem instructs to round the numerical result to $4$ significant figures.

This wavelength falls within the orange region of the visible spectrum. Based on the subtractive color model, an object's perceived color is complementary to the color of light it most strongly absorbs. The complementary color to orange is blue.

It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded question based on the fundamental principles of Crystal Field Theory (CFT) for transition-metal complexes. All necessary parameters and definitions for the calculation are provided, and there are no internal contradictions, ambiguities, or factual unsoundness. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires the analysis of an octahedral complex with a metal ion having a $d^{4}$ electron configuration. In an octahedral ligand field, the five degenerate $d$-orbitals split into two sets: the lower-energy, triply degenerate $t_{2g}$ orbitals (d$_{xy}$, d$_{xz}$, d$_{yz}$) and the higher-energy, doubly degenerate $e_{g}$ orbitals (d$_{z^2}$, d$_{x^2-y^2}$). The energy separation between these sets is the crystal field splitting parameter, $\\Delta_{o}$.\n\nFollowing the rules provided, the energy of an electron in a $t_{2g}$ orbital is $-0.4\\,\\Delta_{o}$ and the energy of an electron in an $e_{g}$ orbital is $+0.6\\,\\Delta_{o}$. The energy of the barycenter is conserved, as $3 \\times (-0.4\\,\\Delta_{o}) + 2 \\times (+0.6\\,\\Delta_{o}) = -1.2\\,\\Delta_{o} + 1.2\\,\\Delta_{o} = 0$. An energy penalty, $P$, is incurred for each pair of electrons occupying the same orbital. We must consider two limiting cases for electron distribution: high-spin and low-spin.\n\nFirst, we analyze the high-spin configuration. The high-spin case arises when the crystal field splitting $\\Delta_{o}$ is small compared to the pairing energy $P$ (i.e., $\\Delta_{o}  P$). In this scenario, electrons will occupy the higher-energy $e_{g}$ orbitals before pairing in the lower-energy $t_{2g}$ orbitals, in accordance with Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity. For a $d^{4}$ configuration, the first three electrons will singly occupy the three $t_{2g}$ orbitals. The fourth electron will then occupy one of the $e_{g}$ orbitals to avoid the pairing energy penalty.\nThe electron configuration for the high-spin case is therefore $(t_{2g})^3(e_{g})^1$.\nThe total energy for the high-spin case, $E_{\\text{high-spin}}$, is the sum of the Ligand Field Stabilization Energy (LFSE) and the total pairing energy.\nThe LFSE is calculated as:\n$$\n\\text{LFSE}_{\\text{high-spin}} = 3 \\times (-0.4\\,\\Delta_{o}) + 1 \\times (+0.6\\,\\Delta_{o}) = -1.2\\,\\Delta_{o} + 0.6\\,\\Delta_{o} = -0.6\\,\\Delta_{o}\n$$\nIn this configuration, there are no paired electrons, so the total pairing energy is $0 \\times P = 0$.\nThus, the total energy is:\n$$\nE_{\\text{high-spin}} = -0.6\\,\\Delta_{o} + 0 = -0.6\\,\\Delta_{o}\n$$\n\nNext, we analyze the low-spin configuration. The low-spin case occurs when the crystal field splitting $\\Delta_{o}$ is large compared to the pairing energy $P$ (i.e., $\\Delta_{o}  P$). Here, it is energetically more favorable for electrons to pair in the lower-energy $t_{2g}$ orbitals than to be promoted to the high-energy $e_{g}$ orbitals. For a $d^{4}$ configuration, the first three electrons singly occupy the $t_{2g}$ orbitals. The fourth electron will then pair with one of the electrons already in a $t_{2g}$ orbital.\nThe electron configuration for the low-spin case is therefore $(t_{2g})^4(e_{g})^0$.\nThe total energy for the low-spin case, $E_{\\text{low-spin}}$, is calculated similarly.\nThe LFSE is:\n$$\n\\text{LFSE}_{\\text{low-spin}} = 4 \\times (-0.4\\,\\Delta_{o}) + 0 \\times (+0.6\\,\\Delta_{o}) = -1.6\\,\\Delta_{o}\n$$\nIn this configuration, there is one pair of electrons in one of the $t_{2g}$ orbitals. This introduces a pairing energy penalty of $1 \\times P = P$.\nThus, the total energy is:\n$$\nE_{\\text{low-spin}} = -1.6\\,\\Delta_{o} + P\n$$\n\nFinally, we are required to compute the energy difference $\\Delta E \\equiv E_{\\text{low-spin}} - E_{\\text{high-spin}}$. Using the expressions derived above:\n$$\n\\Delta E = E_{\\text{low-spin}} - E_{\\text{high-spin}} = (-1.6\\,\\Delta_{o} + P) - (-0.6\\,\\Delta_{o})\n$$\nSimplifying this expression yields:\n$$\n\\Delta E = -1.6\\,\\Delta_{o} + P + 0.6\\,\\Delta_{o} = (-1.6 + 0.6)\\,\\Delta_{o} + P = -1.0\\,\\Delta_{o} + P\n$$\nTherefore, the energy difference is:\n$$\n\\Delta E = P - \\Delta_{o}\n$$\nThis result is logical: the low-spin state is more stable (i.e., $\\Delta E  0$) when the pairing energy $P$ is less than the splitting energy $\\Delta_{o}$.

It is a standard problem in the field of inorganic chemistry, specifically concerning the magnetic properties of transition metal complexes. I will therefore proceed with a complete solution. The solution is presented in three parts as requested: derivation of the spin-only magnetic moment formula, determination of the number of unpaired electrons for the specified ions, and calculation of the magnetic moments.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the Spin-Only Magnetic Moment\nThe magnetic dipole moment, $\\vec{\\mu}_s$, associated with the spin of a single electron is proportional to its spin angular momentum, $\\vec{S}$. The quantum mechanical operators are related by:\n$$\n\\hat{\\vec{\\mu}}_s = -g_e \\frac{e}{2m_e} \\hat{\\vec{s}}\n$$\nwhere $g_e$ is the g-factor for a free electron, $e$ is the elementary charge, $m_e$ is the electron rest mass, and $\\hat{\\vec{s}}$ is the electron spin angular momentum operator. The quantity $\\frac{e\\hbar}{2m_e}$ is defined as the Bohr magneton, $\\mu_B$. We can rewrite the operator relation in terms of $\\mu_B$ and the dimensionless spin operator $\\frac{\\hat{\\vec{s}}}{\\hbar}$:\n$$\n\\hat{\\vec{\\mu}}_s = -g_e \\mu_B \\frac{\\hat{\\vec{s}}}{\\hbar}\n$$\nFor a system with multiple electrons, the total spin magnetic moment operator $\\hat{\\vec{\\mu}}_S$ is the vector sum of the individual moments:\n$$\n\\hat{\\vec{\\mu}}_S = \\sum_{i} \\hat{\\vec{\\mu}}_{s,i} = -g_e \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar} \\sum_{i} \\hat{\\vec{s}}_i = -g_e \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar} \\hat{\\vec{S}}\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{\\vec{S}} = \\sum_i \\hat{\\vec{s}}_i$ is the total spin angular momentum operator for the ion. The problem states that we are to use the spin-only approximation, which is valid when the orbital angular momentum is quenched by the ligand field. In this approximation, the effective magnetic moment, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, is equivalent to the spin-only magnetic moment, $\\mu_{\\mathrm{so}}$.\n\nThe magnitude of the effective magnetic moment is conventionally defined via the magnitude of the total angular momentum. The magnitude-squared of the total spin angular momentum is given by the eigenvalue of the $\\hat{S}^2$ operator:\n$$\n\\hat{S}^2 \\Psi = S(S+1)\\hbar^2 \\Psi\n$$\nwhere $S$ is the total spin quantum number. The magnitude-squared of the magnetic moment operator is:\n$$\n\\hat{\\mu}_S^2 = \\hat{\\vec{\\mu}}_S \\cdot \\hat{\\vec{\\mu}}_S = \\left(-g_e \\frac{\\mu_B}{\\hbar}\\right)^2 \\hat{\\vec{S}} \\cdot \\hat{\\vec{S}} = g_e^2 \\frac{\\mu_B^2}{\\hbar^2} \\hat{S}^2\n$$\nThe observable magnetic moment is the root-mean-square value of this operator's expectation value. For an eigenstate of $\\hat{S}^2$, this is:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{so}} = \\sqrt{\\langle \\hat{\\mu}_S^2 \\rangle} = \\sqrt{g_e^2 \\frac{\\mu_B^2}{\\hbar^2} S(S+1)\\hbar^2} = g_e \\sqrt{S(S+1)} \\mu_B\n$$\nFor calculations involving transition metal ions, the free-electron g-factor $g_e \\approx 2.0023$ is typically approximated as $g \\approx 2$. This approximation is standard for the spin-only formula. Adopting this, we have:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{so}} \\approx 2 \\sqrt{S(S+1)} \\mu_B\n$$\nThe total spin quantum number, $S$, is related to the number of unpaired electrons, $n$. In a high-spin configuration, the spins of all unpaired electrons align parallel to maximize the total spin. Since each electron has a spin of $s = \\frac{1}{2}$, the total spin for $n$ unpaired electrons is $S = n \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{n}{2}$.\n\nSubstituting $S = \\frac{n}{2}$ into the expression for $\\mu_{\\mathrm{so}}$:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{so}} = 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{n}{2}\\left(\\frac{n}{2} + 1\\right)} \\mu_B = 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{n}{2}\\left(\\frac{n+2}{2}\\right)} \\mu_B = 2 \\sqrt{\\frac{n(n+2)}{4}} \\mu_B\n$$\nSimplifying this expression yields the final closed-form formula for the spin-only magnetic moment as a function of $n$:\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{so}} = \\sqrt{n(n+2)} \\mu_B\n$$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nPart 2: Determination of the Number of Unpaired Electrons ($n$)\nIn an octahedral ligand field, the five degenerate $d$-orbitals of a transition-metal ion are split into a lower-energy triply degenerate set ($t_{2g}$) and a higher-energy doubly degenerate set ($e_g$). The energy separation is the crystal-field splitting energy, $\\Delta_o$.\nThe problem specifies weak-field ligands. According to the spectrochemical series, this implies that $\\Delta_o$ is small compared to the electron pairing energy, $P$. Consequently, a high-spin configuration is adopted. Electrons will occupy all $d$-orbitals singly (both $t_{2g}$ and $e_g$) before any pairing occurs, in accordance with Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity.\n\n- For a high-spin $d^4$ ion: The first three electrons singly occupy the $t_{2g}$ orbitals. Because $\\Delta_o  P$, the fourth electron will occupy an $e_g$ orbital rather than pairing up in a $t_{2g}$ orbital. The electronic configuration is $t_{2g}^3 e_g^1$. All four electrons are unpaired. Thus, $n=4$.\n\n- For a high-spin $d^5$ ion: Following the same principle, the five electrons will singly occupy all five available $d$-orbitals. The configuration is $t_{2g}^3 e_g^2$. This configuration has the maximum possible number of unpaired electrons. Thus, $n=5$.\n\n- For a high-spin $d^6$ ion: The first five electrons occupy the orbitals as in the $d^5$ case ($t_{2g}^3 e_g^2$). The sixth electron must now pair with an electron in the lowest available energy level, which is the $t_{2g}$ set. The configuration becomes $t_{2g}^4 e_g^2$. This results in one pair of electrons in a $t_{2g}$ orbital and four unpaired electrons (two in $t_{2g}$ and two in $e_g$). Thus, $n=4$.\n\nPart 3: Evaluation of $\\mu_{\\mathrm{so}}$\nUsing the derived formula $\\mu_{\\mathrm{so}} = \\sqrt{n(n+2)}$ and the values of $n$ determined above, we calculate the magnetic moments. The results are to be expressed in units of Bohr magnetons, $\\mu_B$, as exact radicals.\n\n- For the high-spin $d^4$ ion ($n=4$):\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{so}} = \\sqrt{4(4+2)} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 6} = \\sqrt{24} = \\sqrt{4 \\times 6} = 2\\sqrt{6}\n$$\n\n- For the high-spin $d^5$ ion ($n=5$):\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{so}} = \\sqrt{5(5+2)} = \\sqrt{5 \\times 7} = \\sqrt{35}\n$$\nThe number $35$ has no square factors, so the radical cannot be simplified.\n\n- For the high-spin $d^6$ ion ($n=4$):\nThe number of unpaired electrons is the same as for the $d^4$ case. Therefore, the magnetic moment is identical.\n$$\n\\mu_{\\mathrm{so}} = \\sqrt{4(4+2)} = \\sqrt{24} = 2\\sqrt{6}\n$$\n\nThe calculated spin-only magnetic moments in units of $\\mu_B$ are $2\\sqrt{6}$ for high-spin $d^4$, $\\sqrt{35}$ for high-spin $d^5$, and $2\\sqrt{6}$ for high-spin $d^6$.
