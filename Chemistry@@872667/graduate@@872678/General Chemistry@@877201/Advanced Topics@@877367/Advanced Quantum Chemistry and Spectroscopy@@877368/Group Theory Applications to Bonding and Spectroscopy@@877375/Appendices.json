Consider the two idealized conformers about the carbon–carbon bond: the staggered conformer (with a dihedral offset of $60^{\\circ}$ between the methyl groups) and the eclipsed conformer (with a dihedral offset of $0^{\\circ}$). Assume idealized tetrahedral $\\mathrm{C-H}$ bond angles, identical $\\mathrm{C-H}$ bond lengths, and indistinguishable hydrogen atoms within each methyl group. Using the fundamental definitions of symmetry operations—proper rotation $C_n$, reflection $\\sigma$ (with $\\sigma_h$ perpendicular to the principal axis, $\\sigma_v$ containing the principal axis, and $\\sigma_d$ bisecting angles between $C_2$ axes), inversion $i$, and improper rotation $S_n$—determine the point group of the staggered and eclipsed conformers.

Any apparent differences in mirror planes or inversion arise from neglecting internal methyl rotation; in the static limit the symmetry elements coincide.", "solution": "The problem statement will first be validated for scientific soundness and consistency before a solution is attempted.\n\n**Step 1: Extract Givens**\n-   Molecule: Ethane, $\\mathrm{C_2H_6}$, composed of two $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ groups.\n-   Conformers to consider:\n    1.  Staggered: Dihedral offset of $60^{\\circ}$.\n    2.  Eclipsed: Dihedral offset of $0^{\\circ}$.\n-   Assumed geometry:\n    -   Idealized tetrahedral $\\mathrm{C-H}$ bond angles.\n    -   Identical $\\mathrm{C-H}$ bond lengths.\n    -   Indistinguishable hydrogen atoms within each methyl group.\n-   Task: Determine the point group for each conformer and identify the symmetry elements that are present in one but absent in the other.\n-   Definitions provided for symmetry operations: $C_n$ (proper rotation), $\\sigma$ (reflection: $\\sigma_h, \\sigma_v, \\sigma_d$), $i$ (inversion), and $S_n$ (improper rotation).\n\n**Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, rooted in the fundamental principles of molecular symmetry and group theory, which are cornerstone concepts in chemistry. The use of idealized conformers (staggered and eclipsed ethane) is a standard and valid pedagogical approach to illustrate these principles. The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient geometric constraints (idealized tetrahedral angles, specific dihedral angles) to unambiguously determine the point groups. The language is precise and objective, free from subjective or non-scientific claims. There are no internal contradictions, missing data, or other flaws that would invalidate the problem.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution will now be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Point Groups and Symmetry Elements**\n\nThe analysis will proceed by identifying the symmetry elements for each conformer based on the provided geometric constraints. The principal axis in both cases is the C-C bond, which we align with the $z$-axis.\n\n**1. Staggered Ethane**\nIn the staggered conformation, the hydrogen atoms on the rear carbon are rotated by $60^{\\circ}$ relative to the hydrogen atoms on the front carbon when viewed along the C-C bond axis.\n\n-   **Identity ($E$):** Present in all groups.\n-   **Proper Rotation ($C_n$):** Rotation by $360^{\\circ}/3 = 120^{\\circ}$ about the C-C axis is a symmetry operation. Thus, a $C_3$ axis is present. This generates two operations, $C_3$ and $C_3^2$. There are also three $C_2$ axes perpendicular to the $C_3$ axis, passing through the midpoint of the C-C bond and bisecting the H-C-H angles on both ends. The presence of a principal $C_3$ axis and $3$ perpendicular $C_2$ axes indicates the group belongs to the $D_3$ family.\n-   **Reflection ($\\sigma$):**\n    -   There is no horizontal mirror plane ($\\sigma_h$) perpendicular to the $C_3$ axis. Reflecting one $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ group through such a plane would place its hydrogens in an eclipsed position relative to the other group, which is not the original staggered geometry.\n    -   There are three vertical mirror planes that contain the $C_3$ axis. Each plane passes through one C-H bond on the front carbon and the corresponding C-H bond on the back carbon. These planes bisect the angles between the perpendicular $C_2$ axes, so they are classified as dihedral planes, $3\\sigma_d$.\n-   **Inversion ($i$):** There is a center of inversion $i$ at the midpoint of the C-C bond. For any atom at coordinates $(x, y, z)$ relative to this center, an identical atom exists at $(-x, -y, -z)$. This is true for the carbon atoms and for each pair of hydrogen atoms.\n-   **Improper Rotation ($S_n$):** The presence of a $C_3$ axis and an inversion center $i$ implies the existence of an $S_6$ axis collinear with the $C_3$ axis, since $S_{2n}$ must exist if $C_n$ (n=odd) and $i$ exist. The $S_6$ operation consists of a rotation by $360^{\\circ}/6=60^{\\circ}$ followed by a reflection through a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis. This operation maps the staggered conformer onto itself. The distinct operations are $S_6$ and $S_6^5$. Note that $S_6^3=i$ and $S_6^2=C_3$. There is no independent $S_3$ axis distinct from the operations generated by $S_6$.\n\nThe collection of symmetry elements ($E$, $2C_3$, $3C_2$, $i$, $2S_6$, $3\\sigma_d$) corresponds to the point group $D_{3d}$.\n\n**2. Eclipsed Ethane**\nIn the eclipsed conformation, the hydrogen atoms on the rear carbon are directly behind the hydrogen atoms on the front carbon when viewed along the C-C bond axis (dihedral angle of $0^{\\circ}$).\n\n-   **Identity ($E$):** Present.\n-   **Proper Rotation ($C_n$):** A $C_3$ axis is present along the C-C bond, as in the staggered case. Three $C_2$ axes are also present, perpendicular to the $C_3$ axis. Each $C_2$ axis passes through the midpoint of the C-C bond and lies in the plane halfway between the two sets of hydrogen atoms, bisecting the projected H-C-H angle. This again places the group in the $D_3$ family.\n-   **Reflection ($\\sigma$):**\n    -   There is a horizontal mirror plane ($\\sigma_h$) perpendicular to the $C_3$ axis, located at the midpoint of the C-C bond. This plane reflects the front $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ group exactly onto the back $\\mathrm{CH_3}$ group.\n    -   There are three vertical mirror planes, each containing the C-C axis and one pair of eclipsed C-H bonds. Since these planes contain the perpendicular $C_2$ axes, they are classified as $3\\sigma_v$.\n-   **Inversion ($i$):** There is no center of inversion. Inverting a hydrogen atom on one carbon through the midpoint of the C-C bond would place it in an empty region of space, not on another hydrogen atom.\n-   **Improper Rotation ($S_n$):** The presence of $C_3$ and $\\sigma_h$ guarantees the existence of an $S_3$ axis collinear with the $C_3$ axis ($S_3 = C_3 \\circ \\sigma_h$). The distinct operations are $S_3$ and $S_3^5$. There is no $S_6$ axis; a $60^{\\circ}$ rotation followed by reflection in $\\sigma_h$ does not leave the molecule unchanged.\n\nThe collection of symmetry elements ($E$, $2C_3$, $3C_2$, $\\sigma_h$, $2S_3$, $3\\sigma_v$) corresponds to the point group $D_{3h}$.\n\n**Summary of Differences**\n-   **Shared elements:** $E$, $C_3$ axis, $3C_2$ axes.\n-   **Unique to Staggered ($D_{3d}$):** $i$, $S_6$ axis, $3\\sigma_d$ planes.\n-   **Unique to Eclipsed ($D_{3h}$):** $\\sigma_h$ plane, $S_3$ axis, $3\\sigma_v$ planes.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n*   **A. Staggered ethane is $D_{3d}$ and eclipsed ethane is $D_{3h}$. They share a principal $C_3$ axis and $3$ mutually perpendicular $C_2$ axes transverse to that axis. The staggered conformer has an inversion center $i$, $3\\sigma_d$ planes, and a set of $2S_6$ operations, but no $\\sigma_h$ or $S_3$; the eclipsed conformer has a horizontal mirror plane $\\sigma_h$, $3\\sigma_v$ planes, and a set of $2S_3$ operations, but no inversion center $i$ or $S_6$.**\n    This statement correctly identifies both point groups ($D_{3d}$ for staggered, $D_{3h}$ for eclipsed). It correctly lists the shared $C_3$ and $3C_2$ axes (the term \"mutually perpendicular $C_2$ axes\" is a common, though slightly imprecise, way to state that the $C_2$ axes are at $120^{\\circ}$ to each other and perpendicular to $C_3$). It correctly identifies the symmetry elements unique to the staggered conformer ($i$, $3\\sigma_d$, $2S_6$) and those unique to the eclipsed conformer ($\\sigma_h$, $3\\sigma_v$, $2S_3$). It also correctly states which elements are absent in each case. This option is fully consistent with the derivation. **Correct**.\n\n*   **B. Staggered ethane is $D_{3h}$ and eclipsed ethane is $D_{3d}$. They share a principal $C_3$ axis and $3$ mutually perpendicular $C_2$ axes; the staggered conformer has $\\sigma_h$ and $2S_3$, while the eclipsed conformer has $i$, $3\\sigma_d$, and $2S_6$.**\n    This option incorrectly swaps the point group assignments. Staggered ethane is $D_{3d}$, not $D_{3h}$, because it lacks a $\\sigma_h$. Eclipsed ethane is $D_{3h}$, not $D_{3d}$, because it lacks an inversion center $i$. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **C. Staggered ethane is $D_{3d}$ and eclipsed ethane is $D_{3h}$. They share a principal $C_3$ axis, and both possess an inversion center $i$ and a horizontal mirror plane $\\sigma_h$; the distinguishing elements are only the counts of $S_n$ operations.**\n    The point group assignments are correct. However, the claim that both conformers possess both $i$ and $\\sigma_h$ is false. Staggered ($D_{3d}$) has $i$ but no $\\sigma_h$. Eclipsed ($D_{3h}$) has $\\sigma_h$ but no $i$. The distinguishing elements are not just the $S_n$ operations. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **D. Staggered ethane is $C_{3v}$ and eclipsed ethane is $D_{3h}$. The difference is that the staggered conformer lacks any $C_2$ axes perpendicular to the principal axis and has only $3\\sigma_v$ planes, whereas the eclipsed conformer has $3C_2$ axes and $\\sigma_h$.**\n    This option incorrectly assigns the point group $C_{3v}$ to staggered ethane. As derived, staggered ethane possesses three $C_2$ axes perpendicular to the principal $C_3$ axis, which is a defining characteristic of $D$ groups. Therefore, it cannot be $C_{3v}$. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **E. Both staggered and eclipsed ethane are $D_{3d}$. Any apparent differences in mirror planes or inversion arise from neglecting internal methyl rotation; in the static limit the symmetry elements coincide.**\n    This option incorrectly claims both conformers belong to the $D_{3d}$ point group. Eclipsed ethane is definitively $D_{3h}$. The problem explicitly treats the conformers as static, idealized structures, for which the symmetry properties are distinct. The reasoning about internal rotation is irrelevant to the question asked. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2940455"}, {"introduction": "Once a molecule's point group is known, we can use it to predict and classify molecular properties, such as vibrational modes.

It is a standard application of group theory to molecular vibrations, a fundamental topic in physical chemistry. Therefore, I will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe task is to determine the characters of the reducible representation, $\\Gamma_{\\text{stretch}}$, generated by the three $\\text{N-H}$ bond stretching coordinates of ammonia, $\\text{NH}_3$, and subsequently to reduce this representation into its constituent irreducible representations of the $C_{3v}$ point group.\n\nLet the basis for our representation be the set of three scalar coordinates $\\{r_1, r_2, r_3\\}$, where each $r_i$ denotes the displacement of the $i$-th $\\text{N-H}$ bond length from its equilibrium value. The character of a representation for a given symmetry operation $R$, denoted $\\chi(R)$, is defined as the trace of the matrix that transforms the basis vectors under that operation. A more direct method for this type of problem is to count the number of basis vectors that are left unshifted by the symmetry operation. For a bond stretching coordinate, an unshifted bond is one that is mapped onto itself by the operation, contributing a value of $+1$ to the character. A bond that is moved to the position of a different bond contributes $0$ to the trace, as this corresponds to an off-diagonal element in the transformation matrix.\n\nThe $C_{3v}$ point group has three classes of operations: the identity $\\{E\\}$, two rotations by $\\pm \\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ radians $\\{2C_3\\}$, and three vertical mirror planes $\\{3\\sigma_v\\}$. The order of the group is $h = 6$. We will now determine the character of $\\Gamma_{\\text{stretch}}$ for a representative operation from each class.\n\n1.  **Identity Operation ($E$)**: The identity operation leaves every bond unchanged. The transformation matrix is the $3 \\times 3$ identity matrix:\n    $$\n    E \\begin{pmatrix} r_1 \\\\ r_2 \\\\ r_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} r_1 \\\\ r_2 \\\\ r_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} r_1 \\\\ r_2 \\\\ r_3 \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    The number of unshifted bonds is $3$. The character is the trace of this matrix: $\\chi_{\\text{stretch}}(E) = \\text{Tr}(\\mathbf{M}_E) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3$.\n\n2.  **$C_3$ Rotation Operation**: The principal $C_3$ axis passes through the nitrogen atom and permutes the three hydrogen atoms, and thus the three $\\text{N-H}$ bonds. For example, $r_1 \\rightarrow r_2$, $r_2 \\rightarrow r_3$, and $r_3 \\rightarrow r_1$. The transformation matrix is a permutation matrix:\n    $$\n    C_3 \\begin{pmatrix} r_1 \\\\ r_2 \\\\ r_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} r_1 \\\\ r_2 \\\\ r_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} r_3 \\\\ r_1 \\\\ r_2 \\end{pmatrix} \n    $$\n    No bond is left in its original position. The number of unshifted bonds is $0$. The character is the trace of this matrix: $\\chi_{\\text{stretch}}(C_3) = \\text{Tr}(\\mathbf{M}_{C_3}) = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0$. This holds for both the $C_3^1$ and $C_3^2$ operations.\n\n3.  **$\\sigma_v$ Reflection Operation**: Each of the three vertical mirror planes $\\sigma_v$ contains one $\\text{N-H}$ bond and bisects the angle between the other two. Let us consider the plane containing the $r_1$ bond. This operation leaves $r_1$ unshifted and interchanges $r_2$ and $r_3$. The transformation matrix is:\n    $$\n    \\sigma_v \\begin{pmatrix} r_1 \\\\ r_2 \\\\ r_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} r_1 \\\\ r_2 \\\\ r_3 \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} r_1 \\\\ r_3 \\\\ r_2 \\end{pmatrix}\n    $$\n    One bond, $r_1$, is unshifted.

Thus, $\\chi_{3N}(i) = 1 \\times (-3) = -3$.\n- $2S_4(z)$: Only the $\\mathrm{Xe}$ atom is unmoved. The trace of an $S_4$ improper rotation matrix is $-1 + 2\\cos(90^\\circ) = -1$. Thus, $\\chi_{3N}(S_4) = 1 \\times (-1) = -1$.\n- $\\sigma_h(xy)$: The reflection plane contains all $5$ atoms. All are unmoved. The trace of the reflection matrix for a horizontal plane is $1$. Thus, $\\chi_{3N}(\\sigma_h) = 5 \\times 1 = 5$.\n- $2\\sigma_v(xz, yz)$: The reflection planes contain one $\\mathrm{Xe}$ and two $\\mathrm{F}$ atoms. Three atoms are unmoved. The trace of a reflection matrix for a vertical plane is $1$. Thus, $\\chi_{3N}(\\sigma_v) = 3 \\times 1 = 3$.\n- $2\\sigma_d$: The reflection planes are dihedral. Only the $\\mathrm{Xe}$ atom is on these planes. The trace is $1$. Thus, $\\chi_{3N}(\\sigma_d) = 1 \\times 1 = 1$.\n\nThe characters for the reducible representation $\\Gamma_{3N}$ are therefore:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|cccccccccc}\nD_{4h} & E & 2C_4 & C_2 & 2C_2' & 2C_2'' & i & 2S_4 & \\sigma_h & 2\\sigma_v & 2\\sigma_d \\\\\n\\hline\n\\chi_{3N} & 15 & 1 & -1 & -3 & -1 & -3 & -1 & 5 & 3 & 1\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nNext, we reduce $\\Gamma_{3N}$ into a direct sum of irreducible representations (irreps) of the $D_{4h}$ group. The number of times an irrep $\\Gamma_i$ appears in $\\Gamma_{3N}$ is given by the reduction formula:\n$$n_i = \\frac{1}{h} \\sum_R g(R) \\chi_i(R) \\chi_{3N}(R)$$\nwhere $h$ is the order of the group ($16$ for $D_{4h}$), $g(R)$ is the number of operations in a class, and $\\chi_i(R)$ is the character of the irrep $\\Gamma_i$ for the class $R$. Using the $D_{4h}$ character table, we find:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $n_{A_{1g}} = \\frac{1}{16}[1(15)+2(1)+1(-1)+2(-3)+2(-1)+1(-3)+2(-1)+1(5)+2(3)+2(1)] = \\frac{16}{16} = 1$\n    \\item $n_{A_{2g}} = \\frac{1}{16}[1(15)+2(1)+1(-1)+2(3)+2(1)+1(-3)+2(-1)+1(5)+2(-3)+2(-1)] = \\frac{16}{16} = 1$\n    \\item $n_{B_{1g}} = \\frac{1}{16}[1(15)+2(-1)+1(-1)+2(-3)+2(1)+1(-3)+2(1)+1(5)+2(3)+2(-1)] = \\frac{16}{16} = 1$\n    \\item $n_{B_{2g}} = \\frac{1}{16}[1(15)+2(-1)+1(-1)+2(3)+2(-1)+1(-3)+2(1)+1(5)+2(-3)+2(1)] = \\frac{16}{16} = 1$\n    \\item $n_{E_g}  = \\frac{1}{16}[2(15)+0+1(-2)(-1)+0+0+1(2)(-3)+0+1(-2)(5)+0+0] = \\frac{16}{16} = 1$\n    \\item $n_{A_{1u}} = \\frac{1}{16}[1(15)+2(1)+1(-1)+2(-3)+2(-1)+1(3)+2(1)+1(-5)+2(-3)+2(-1)] = \\frac{0}{16} = 0$\n    \\item $n_{A_{2u}} = \\frac{1}{16}[1(15)+2(1)+1(-1)+2(3)+2(1)+1(3)+2(1)+1(-5)+2(3)+2(1)] = \\frac{32}{16} = 2$\n    \\item $n_{B_{1u}} = \\frac{1}{16}[1(15)+2(-1)+1(-1)+2(-3)+2(1)+1(3)+2(-1)+1(-5)+2(-3)+2(1)] = \\frac{0}{16} = 0$\n    \\item $n_{B_{2u}} = \\frac{1}{16}[1(15)+2(-1)+1(-1)+2(3)+2(-1)+1(3)+2(-1)+1(-5)+2(3)+2(-1)] = \\frac{16}{16} = 1$\n    \\item $n_{E_u}  = \\frac{1}{16}[2(15)+0+1(-2)(-1)+0+0+1(-2)(-3)+0+1(2)(5)+0+0] = \\frac{48}{16} = 3$\n\\end{itemize}\nSo, the full representation is:\n$$ \\Gamma_{3N} = A_{1g} \\oplus A_{2g} \\oplus B_{1g} \\oplus B_{2g} \\oplus E_g \\oplus 2A_{2u} \\oplus B_{2u} \\oplus 3E_u $$\nThe sum of the dimensions is $1+1+1+1+2+2(1)+1+3(2) = 15$, which is correct.\n\nTo obtain the representation for the vibrational modes, $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{vib}}$, we subtract the representations for translational and rotational motion.\nThe translational vectors $(x, y, z)$ transform as $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{trans}}$. From the character table, $z$ transforms as $A_{2u}$ and $(x, y)$ as $E_u$.\n$$ \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{trans}} = A_{2u} \\oplus E_u $$\nThe rotational vectors $(R_x, R_y, R_z)$ transform as $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{rot}}$. From the character table, $R_z$ transforms as $A_{2g}$ and $(R_x, R_y)$ as $E_g$.\n$$ \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{rot}} = A_{2g} \\oplus E_g $$\nSubtracting these from $\\Gamma_{3N}$:\n$$ \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{vib}} = \\Gamma_{3N} - \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{trans}} - \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{rot}} $$\n$$ \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{vib}} = (A_{1g} \\oplus A_{2g} \\oplus B_{1g} \\oplus B_{2g} \\oplus E_g \\oplus 2A_{2u} \\oplus B_{2u} \\oplus 3E_u) - (A_{2u} \\oplus E_u) - (A_{2g} \\oplus E_g) $$\n$$ \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{vib}} = A_{1g} \\oplus B_{1g} \\oplus B_{2g} \\oplus A_{2u} \\oplus B_{2u} \\oplus 2E_u $$\nThe total number of vibrational modes is the dimension of this representation: $1+1+1+1+1+2(2) = 9$. This matches the expected $3N-6=9$ for a non-linear molecule.\n\nFinally, we identify the IR and Raman active modes.\nA vibrational mode is IR active if its irrep transforms as one of the Cartesian coordinates $x$, $y$, or $z$. In $D_{4h}$, these are $A_{2u}$ (for $z$) and $E_u$ (for $(x,y)$).\nA vibrational mode is Raman active if its irrep transforms as one of the quadratic forms ($x^2$, $y^2$, $z^2$, $xy$, $xz$, $yz$). In $D_{4h}$, these are $A_{1g}$ (for $x^2+y^2, z^2$), $B_{1g}$ (for $x^2-y^2$), $B_{2g}$ (for $xy$), and $E_g$ (for $(xz, yz)$).\nSince $\\mathrm{XeF_4}$ has a center of symmetry, the rule of mutual exclusion applies: no mode can be both IR and Raman active.\n\nWe analyze the irreps in $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{vib}}$:\n- $A_{1g}$: Raman active.\n- $B_{1g}$: Raman active.\n- $B_{2g}$: Raman active.\n- $A_{2u}$: IR active.\n- $B_{2u}$: Neither IR nor Raman active (a \"silent\" mode).\n- $2E_u$: Two distinct modes of $E_u$ symmetry, both IR active.\n\nThe problem asks for the total number of IR-active and Raman-active modes, counted with degeneracies.\nThe IR-active modes are one of $A_{2u}$ symmetry (singly degenerate) and two of $E_u$ symmetry (each doubly degenerate).\nThe total number of IR-active normal modes, $n_{\\mathrm{IR}}$, is the sum of the dimensions of these active irreps:\n$$ n_{\\mathrm{IR}} = 1 \\times \\dim(A_{2u}) + 2 \\times \\dim(E_u) = 1 \\times 1 + 2 \\times 2 = 5 $$\nThe Raman-active modes are one of $A_{1g}$ symmetry, one of $B_{1g}$ symmetry, and one of $B_{2g}$ symmetry, all of which are singly degenerate.\nThe total number of Raman-active normal modes, $n_{\\mathrm{Raman}}$, is:\n$$ n_{\\mathrm{Raman}} = 1 \\times \\dim(A_{1g}) + 1 \\times \\dim(B_{1g}) + 1 \\times \\dim(B_{2g}) = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 $$\nThe final answer is the row matrix $(n_{\\mathrm{IR}}, n_{\\mathrm{Raman}})$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n5 & 3\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2940362"}]}
