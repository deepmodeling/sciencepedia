A complete solution will be provided.\n\n**Solution**\n\nThe problem requires the derivation of the term symbols for a $p^2$ electronic configuration using first principles. This configuration consists of two equivalent electrons in a subshell defined by the orbital angular momentum quantum number $l=1$.\n\nFirst, we enumerate the possible single-electron states, or spin-orbitals. For a $p$ electron, $l=1$, so the magnetic orbital quantum number $m_l$ can take values $\\{-1, 0, +1\\}$. The spin quantum number is $s=\\frac{1}{2}$, so the magnetic spin quantum number $m_s$ can take values $\\{-\\frac{1}{2}, +\\frac{1}{2}\\}$. This gives $2(2l+1) = 2(2(1)+1) = 6$ distinct spin-orbitals, which we can denote by the pair $(m_l, m_s)$:\n$$\n(1, +\\tfrac{1}{2}), (1, -\\tfrac{1}{2}), (0, +\\tfrac{1}{2}), (0, -\\tfrac{1}{2}), (-1, +\\tfrac{1}{2}), (-1, -\\tfrac{1}{2})\n$$\n\nAccording to the Pauli exclusion principle, the two electrons must occupy two different spin-orbitals because they are identical fermions. The total number of ways to choose $2$ distinct spin-orbitals from the available $6$ is given by the binomial coefficient:\n$$\nN_{\\text{total}} = \\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} = 15\n$$\nThus, there are $15$ allowed microstates for the $p^2$ configuration. For each microstate, we determine the total magnetic quantum numbers $M_L = m_{l,1} + m_{l,2}$ and $M_S = m_{s,1} + m_{s,2}$. We systematically construct all $15$ pairs of spin-orbitals and the corresponding $(M_L, M_S)$ values.\n\nThe microstates are:\n1.  $\\{(1, +\\tfrac{1}{2}), (1, -\\tfrac{1}{2})\\} \\rightarrow M_L=1+1=2, M_S=\\tfrac{1}{2}-\\tfrac{1}{2}=0 \\implies (2, 0)$\n2.  $\\{(1, +\\tfrac{1}{2}), (0, +\\tfrac{1}{2})\\} \\rightarrow M_L=1+0=1, M_S=\\tfrac{1}{2}+\\tfrac{1}{2}=1 \\implies (1, 1)$\n3.  $\\{(1, +\\tfrac{1}{2}), (0, -\\tfrac{1}{2})\\} \\rightarrow M_L=1+0=1, M_S=\\tfrac{1}{2}-\\tfrac{1}{2}=0 \\implies (1, 0)$\n4.  $\\{(1, +\\tfrac{1}{2}), (-1, +\\tfrac{1}{2})\\} \\rightarrow M_L=1-1=0, M_S=\\tfrac{1}{2}+\\tfrac{1}{2}=1 \\implies (0, 1)$\n5.  $\\{(1, +\\tfrac{1}{2}), (-1, -\\tfrac{1}{2})\\} \\rightarrow M_L=1-1=0, M_S=\\tfrac{1}{2}-\\tfrac{1}{2}=0 \\implies (0, 0)$\n6.  $\\{(1, -\\tfrac{1}{2}), (0, +\\tfrac{1}{2})\\} \\rightarrow M_L=1+0=1, M_S=-\\tfrac{1}{2}+\\tfrac{1}{2}=0 \\implies (1, 0)$\n7.  $\\{(1, -\\tfrac{1}{2}), (0, -\\tfrac{1}{2})\\} \\rightarrow M_L=1+0=1, M_S=-\\tfrac{1}{2}-\\tfrac{1}{2}=-1 \\implies (1, -1)$\n8.  $\\{(1, -\\tfrac{1}{2}), (-1, +\\tfrac{1}{2})\\} \\rightarrow M_L=1-1=0, M_S=-\\tfrac{1}{2}+\\tfrac{1}{2}=0 \\implies (0, 0)$\n9.  $\\{(1, -\\tfrac{1}{2}), (-1, -\\tfrac{1}{2})\\} \\rightarrow M_L=1-1=0, M_S=-\\tfrac{1}{2}-\\tfrac{1}{2}=-1 \\implies (0, -1)$\n10. $\\{(0, +\\tfrac{1}{2}), (0, -\\tfrac{1}{2})\\} \\rightarrow M_L=0+0=0, M_S=\\tfrac{1}{2}-\\tfrac{1}{2}=0 \\implies (0, 0)$\n11. $\\{(0, +\\tfrac{1}{2}), (-1, +\\tfrac{1}{2})\\} \\rightarrow M_L=0-1=-1, M_S=\\tfrac{1}{2}+\\tfrac{1}{2}=1 \\implies (-1, 1)$\n12. $\\{(0, +\\tfrac{1}{2}), (-1, -\\tfrac{1}{2})\\} \\rightarrow M_L=0-1=-1, M_S=\\tfrac{1}{2}-\\tfrac{1}{2}=0 \\implies (-1, 0)$\n13. $\\{(0, -\\tfrac{1}{2}), (-1, +\\tfrac{1}{2})\\} \\rightarrow M_L=0-1=-1, M_S=-\\tfrac{1}{2}+\\tfrac{1}{2}=0 \\implies (-1, 0)$\n14. $\\{(0, -\\tfrac{1}{2}), (-1, -\\tfrac{1}{2})\\} \\rightarrow M_L=0-1=-1, M_S=-\\tfrac{1}{2}-\\tfrac{1}{2}=-1 \\implies (-1, -1)$\n15. $\\{(-1, +\\tfrac{1}{2}), (-1, -\\tfrac{1}{2})\\} \\rightarrow M_L=-1-1=-2, M_S=\\tfrac{1}{2}-\\tfrac{1}{2}=0 \\implies (-2, 0)$\n\nWe summarize the number of microstates for each $(M_L, M_S)$ combination in a table:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|ccc}\n\\hline\nM_L \\setminus M_S  +1  0  -1 \\\\\n\\hline\n+2  0  1  0 \\\\\n+1  1  2  1 \\\\\n0  1  3  1 \\\\\n-1  1  2  1 \\\\\n-2  0  1  0 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n$$\nThe total number of states is $1+1+2+1+1+3+1+1+2+1+1 = 15$, which matches our initial calculation.\n\nNow, we identify the $L$-$S$ terms by \"peeling off\" sets of microstates corresponding to each term, starting from the highest values of $L$ and $S$.\n\n1.  The maximum value of $M_L$ is $2$, which occurs only for the microstate with $M_S=0$. This implies the existence of a term with $L=2$. Since the only corresponding $M_S$ value is $0$, the total spin for this term must be $S=0$. This identifies the term $^{2S+1}L = \\ ^{2(0)+1}D = \\ ^{1}D$. This term accounts for $(2L+1)(2S+1) = (5)(1) = 5$ microstates, corresponding to $(M_L, M_S) = (2,0), (1,0), (0,0), (-1,0), (-2,0)$. Removing these $5$ microstates from our table leaves:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|ccc}\n\\hline\nM_L \\setminus M_S  +1  0  -1 \\\\\n\\hline\n+1  1  1  1 \\\\\n0   1  2  1 \\\\\n-1  1  1  1 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n2.  In the remaining table, the maximum value of $M_L$ is $1$. The microstates with $M_L=1$ possess $M_S$ values of $+1, 0,$ and $-1$. This implies the presence of a term with $L=1$. The range of $M_S$ from $-1$ to $+1$ indicates a total spin of $S=1$. This identifies the term $^{2S+1}L = \\ ^{2(1)+1}P = \\ ^{3}P$. This term accounts for $(2L+1)(2S+1) = (3)(3) = 9$ microstates, a rectangular block for $M_L \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$ and $M_S \\in \\{-1,0,1\\}$. Removing one microstate for each of these $9$ combinations leaves:\n$$\n\\begin{array}{c|ccc}\n\\hline\nM_L \\setminus M_S  +1  0  -1 \\\\\n\\hline\n0  0  1  0 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n3.  Only one microstate remains, with $(M_L, M_S) = (0,0)$. This must belong to a term with $L=0$ and $S=0$. This identifies the final term $^{2S+1}L = \\ ^{2(0)+1}S = \\ ^{1}S$. This term accounts for $(2L+1)(2S+1) = (1)(1) = 1$ microstate.\n\nAfter removing all terms, the table is empty. The derived terms for the $p^2$ configuration are therefore $^{1}D$, $^{3}P$, and $^{1}S$. Each term appears once, so their multiplicities are all $1$.\n\nFinally, we perform the quantitative check by summing the degeneracies of the derived terms:\n$$\nN_{\\text{check}} = \\sum (2S+1)(2L+1)\n$$\nThe sum is over the terms $^{1}D \\ (L=2, S=0)$, $^{3}P \\ (L=1, S=1)$, and $^{1}S \\ (L=0, S=0)$.\n$$\nN_{\\text{check}} = \\underbrace{(2(0)+1)(2(2)+1)}_{^{1}D} + \\underbrace{(2(1)+1)(2(1)+1)}_{^{3}P} + \\underbrace{(2(0)+1)(2(0)+1)}_{^{1}S}\n$$\n$$\nN_{\\text{check}} = (1)(5) + (3)(3) + (1)(1)\n$$\n$$\nN_{\\text{check}} = 5 + 9 + 1 = 15\n$$\nThis value matches the total number of Pauli-allowed microstates, $\\binom{6}{2}=15$, confirming the completeness and correctness of our derivation.

It is scientifically sound, internally consistent, and requires the application of fundamental principles of angular momentum coupling and the Pauli exclusion principle. We shall proceed with its systematic solution.\n\nThe problem considers a $p^{2}$ electronic configuration, meaning two equivalent electrons for which the principal quantum number $n$ is the same and the orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=1$. The spin quantum number for each electron is $s = 1/2$.\n\n(a) In the $jj$ coupling scheme, the orbital and spin angular momenta of each electron are first coupled to form a total angular momentum for that electron, $\\vec{j} = \\vec{l} + \\vec{s}$. The single-electron total angular momentum quantum number $j$ can take values from $|l-s|$ to $l+s$. For a $p$ electron with $l=1$ and $s=1/2$, the possible $j$ values are $j = |1-1/2|, \\dots, 1+1/2$, which are $j=1/2$ and $j=3/2$. The total angular momentum of the atom, $\\vec{J}$, is then the sum of the individual electron total angular momenta, $\\vec{J} = \\vec{j}_{1} + \\vec{j}_{2}$.\n\nWe must analyze the three cases for the $(j_{1}, j_{2})$ pairs and apply the Pauli exclusion principle for equivalent electrons. Two equivalent electrons are defined by the same set of quantum numbers ($n, l$). The Pauli principle requires that the total state of the two electrons be antisymmetric under particle exchange.\n\nCase 1: Both electrons in the $j=1/2$ subshell. The configuration is $(p_{1/2})^{2}$. The electrons are equivalent, as they share quantum numbers $n$, $l=1$, and $j=1/2$. The total angular momentum quantum number $J$ can range from $|j_1 - j_2| = 0$ to $j_1 + j_2 = 1$, so nominally $J=0, 1$. To enforce antisymmetry, we examine the projections $M_J = m_{j1} + m_{j2}$. For $j=1/2$, the possible projections are $m_j = \\pm 1/2$. According to the Pauli principle, two equivalent fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state, so they cannot have the same set of quantum numbers $(n, l, j, m_j)$. Thus, we must have $m_{j1} \\neq m_{j2}$. The only possible combination is $(m_{j1}, m_{j2}) = (1/2, -1/2)$. This yields a maximum (and only) total projection of $M_J = 1/2 - 1/2 = 0$. Since the maximum value of $|M_J|$ is $0$, the only allowed total angular momentum is $J=0$. The $J=1$ state, which would require an $M_J=1$ state arising from $(m_{j1}, m_{j2}) = (1/2, 1/2)$, is forbidden.\n\nCase 2: One electron in $j=1/2$ and the other in $j=3/2$. The configuration is $(p_{1/2})^{1}(p_{3/2})^{1}$. In this case, the electrons are non-equivalent because they have different $j$ values. Therefore, the Pauli principle places no restriction on the coupling of $j_1$ and $j_2$. The allowed values for the total angular momentum $J$ are determined by standard vector addition:\n$$J = |j_{1} - j_{2}|, \\dots, j_{1} + j_{2}$$\n$$J = |1/2 - 3/2|, \\dots, 1/2 + 3/2 = 1, \\dots, 2$$\nThus, the allowed values are $J=1$ and $J=2$.\n\nCase 3: Both electrons in the $j=3/2$ subshell. The configuration is $(p_{3/2})^{2}$. These are equivalent electrons with $j=3/2$. The nominal values for $J$ are $|j_1-j_2|=0$ to $j_1+j_2=3$, i.e., $J=0, 1, 2, 3$. The projections for a single electron are $m_j = \\pm 1/2, \\pm 3/2$. Again, we must have $m_{j1} \\neq m_{j2}$. We construct the possible values of $M_J = m_{j1} + m_{j2}$ by choosing two distinct values from the set $\\{ -3/2, -1/2, 1/2, 3/2 \\}$:\n- $(3/2, 1/2) \\implies M_J = 2$\n- $(3/2, -1/2) \\implies M_J = 1$\n- $(3/2, -3/2) \\implies M_J = 0$\n- $(1/2, -1/2) \\implies M_J = 0$\nThe negative projections are symmetric. The full set of possible $M_J$ values is $\\{2, 1, 0, 0, -1, -2\\}$. The maximum value is $M_J=2$, which implies the existence of a $J=2$ level. This level accounts for one projection at each value $M_J = -2, -1, 0, 1, 2$. After removing these, we are left with a single state with $M_J=0$. This must correspond to a $J=0$ level. A general rule states that for two equivalent fermions with half-integer angular momentum $j$, the allowed total angular momentum values $J$ are even integers from $0$ to $2j-1$. Here, $j=3/2$, so the allowed values are $J=0, 2$. This confirms our direct projection analysis.\n\n(b) In Russell-Saunders ($LS$) coupling, one first couples the orbital angular momenta $\\vec{L} = \\vec{l}_{1} + \\vec{l}_{2}$ and the spin angular momenta $\\vec{S} = \\vec{s}_{1} + \\vec{s}_{2}$ separately. For two $p$ electrons, $l_1=1$ and $l_2=1$. The possible total orbital angular momentum values are $L = |1-1|, \\dots, 1+1$, which are $L=0, 1, 2$. These correspond to $S$, $P$, and $D$ terms respectively. For two electrons, $s_1=1/2$ and $s_2=1/2$. The possible total spin angular momentum values are $S = |1/2-1/2|, \\dots, 1/2+1/2$, which are $S=0$ (singlet) and $S=1$ (triplet).\n\nFor equivalent electrons, the overall wavefunction must be antisymmetric under particle exchange. The spatial part of the wavefunction has a symmetry of $(-1)^L$. The spin part is antisymmetric for $S=0$ (singlet) and symmetric for $S=1$ (triplet). For total antisymmetry:\n- If the spatial part is symmetric ($L=0, 2$, i.e., even $L$), the spin part must be antisymmetric ($S=0$). This gives the terms $^1S$ (read as \"singlet S\") and $^1D$ (read as \"singlet D\").\n- If the spatial part is antisymmetric ($L=1$, i.e., odd $L$), the spin part must be symmetric ($S=1$). This gives the term $^3P$ (read as \"triplet P\").\n\nThe allowed terms are therefore $^1S, ^3P, ^1D$. We now find the total angular momentum $J$ for each term using $J = |L-S|, \\dots, L+S$.\n- For $^1S$: $L=0, S=0 \\implies J=0$. The level is $^1S_0$.\n- For $^1D$: $L=2, S=0 \\implies J=2$. The level is $^1D_2$.\n- For $^3P$: $L=1, S=1 \\implies J=|1-1|, \\dots, 1+1 = 0, 1, 2$. The levels are $^3P_0, ^3P_1, ^3P_2$.\n\nThe total number of states (microstates) is the sum of the degeneracies $(2J+1)$ for all allowed levels.\nIn $LS$ coupling:\n- $^1S_0$: $2(0)+1 = 1$ state.\n- $^1D_2$: $2(2)+1 = 5$ states.\n- $^3P_{0,1,2}$: $(2(0)+1) + (2(1)+1) + (2(2)+1) = 1+3+5 = 9$ states.\nTotal number of states = $1+5+9=15$.\n\nFrom part (a), the total number of states in $jj$ coupling is:\n- $(p_{1/2})^{2}$: $J=0 \\implies 2(0)+1 = 1$ state.\n- $(p_{1/2})^{1}(p_{3/2})^{1}$: $J=1, 2 \\implies (2(1)+1) + (2(2)+1) = 3+5 = 8$ states.\n- $(p_{3/2})^{2}$: $J=0, 2 \\implies (2(0)+1) + (2(2)+1) = 1+5 = 6$ states.\nTotal number of states = $1+8+6 = 15$.\n\nThe total count of microstates must agree because the number of available quantum states for a given electronic configuration is an invariant property of the system, dictated by the Pauli exclusion principle. The number of ways to place $2$ electrons in a subshell with degeneracy $g = 2(2l+1) = 2(2(1)+1) = 6$ is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{g}{2} = \\binom{6}{2} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2} = 15$. Both $LS$ and $jj$ coupling schemes are simply different basis sets (or mathematical frameworks) for describing these same $15$ physical states. The choice of scheme depends on the relative strengths of the electrostatic and spin-orbit interactions, but the dimensionality of the Hilbert space is fixed.\n\n(c) We consider the spin-orbit interaction, $H_{SO} = A \\vec{L} \\cdot \\vec{S}$, as a perturbation on the $^3P$ term. The constant $A$ depends on the radial part of the wavefunction and is positive for a less-than-half-filled shell like $p^2$. The first-order energy correction $\\Delta E_{J}$ for a level with quantum numbers $L, S, J$ is the expectation value of the perturbation.\nWe use the operator identity derived from $\\vec{J} = \\vec{L}+\\vec{S}$:\n$$\\vec{J}^2 = (\\vec{L}+\\vec{S})^2 = \\vec{L}^2 + \\vec{S}^2 + 2\\vec{L}\\cdot\\vec{S}$$\n$$\\vec{L}\\cdot\\vec{S} = \\frac{1}{2}(\\vec{J}^2 - \\vec{L}^2 - \\vec{S}^2)$$\nThe energy shift $\\Delta E_{J}$ is then:\n$$\\Delta E_{J} = \\langle H_{SO} \\rangle = \\frac{A}{2} \\langle \\vec{J}^2 - \\vec{L}^2 - \\vec{S}^2 \\rangle$$\nIn a state of well-defined $L, S, J$, the expectation values of the squared angular momentum operators are their eigenvalues multiplied by $\\hbar^2$. Assuming $A$ includes the factor of $\\hbar^2$:\n$$\\Delta E_{J} = \\frac{A}{2}[J(J+1) - L(L+1) - S(S+1)]$$\nFor the $^3P$ term, $L=1$ and $S=1$. The common shift for the multiplet is $-\\frac{A}{2}[L(L+1)+S(S+1)] = -\\frac{A}{2}[1(2)+1(2)] = -2A$. The energy of each fine-structure level $E(^3P_J)$ relative to the unperturbed energy of the $^3P$ term is:\n- For $J=0$: $\\Delta E_{0} = \\frac{A}{2}[0(1) - 1(2) - 1(2)] = \\frac{A}{2}[0-2-2] = -2A$.\n- For $J=1$: $\\Delta E_{1} = \\frac{A}{2}[1(2) - 1(2) - 1(2)] = \\frac{A}{2}[2-2-2] = -A$.\n- For $J=2$: $\\Delta E_{2} = \\frac{A}{2}[2(3) - 1(2) - 1(2)] = \\frac{A}{2}[6-2-2] = A$.\nSince $A  0$ for this configuration, the energy ordering is $E(^3P_0)  E(^3P_1)  E(^3P_2)$, consistent with Hund's third rule. This is a regular multiplet.\n\nThe problem requires the ratio $R$:\n$$R \\equiv \\frac{E(^{3}P_{2})-E(^{3}P_{1})}{E(^{3}P_{1})-E(^{3}P_{0})}$$\nThe unperturbed energy cancels in the differences, so we use the energy shifts:\n$$E(^{3}P_{2})-E(^{3}P_{1}) = \\Delta E_{2} - \\Delta E_{1} = A - (-A) = 2A$$\n$$E(^{3}P_{1})-E(^{3}P_{0}) = \\Delta E_{1} - \\Delta E_{0} = (-A) - (-2A) = A$$\nThe ratio is therefore:\n$$R = \\frac{2A}{A} = 2$$\nThis result is an instance of the Landé interval rule, which states that the energy separation between adjacent levels $J$ and $J-1$ within a multiplet is proportional to $J$. The interval between $J=2$ and $J=1$ is proportional to $2$, while the interval between $J=1$ and $J=0$ is proportional to $1$.

All principles are standard.\n- **Well-Posed:** The problem provides all necessary numerical data and uncertainties to perform the requested calculations.

It is deemed **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe energy shift $\\Delta E_{SO}$ of a level with total angular momentum quantum number $J$ due to the spin-orbit interaction $\\hat{H}_{SO} = A(\\mathbf{L} \\cdot \\mathbf{S})$ within the Russell-Saunders coupling scheme is given by:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{SO}(J) = \\frac{A}{2} [J(J+1) - L(L+1) - S(S+1)]\n$$\nwhere $A$ is the spin-orbit coupling constant, and $L$ and $S$ are the total orbital and spin angular momentum quantum numbers, respectively. For a $^{3}P$ term, the multiplicity is $2S+1=3$, which implies $S=1$. The term symbol 'P' corresponds to $L=1$. The possible values for $J$ are given by the angular momentum addition rule, $J = |L-S|, \\dots, L+S$, which for this case are $|1-1|, \\dots, 1+1$, yielding $J=0, 1, 2$.\n\nThe energy separation between two adjacent levels $J$ and $J-1$ is:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{J, J-1} = E(J) - E(J-1) = \\Delta E_{SO}(J) - \\Delta E_{SO}(J-1)\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta E_{J, J-1} = \\frac{A}{2} [J(J+1) - (J-1)J] = \\frac{A}{2} [J^2+J - J^2+J] = AJ\n$$\nThis result is the Landé interval rule, which states that the energy splitting between adjacent levels is proportional to the larger of the two $J$ values.\n\n**1) Validation of the Landé Interval Rule**\n\nFrom the Landé interval rule, we expect the following relationship between the two energy spacings in the $^{3}P_{0,1,2}$ multiplet:\n- $\\Delta E_{1,0} = E(1) - E(0) = A \\cdot 1 = A$\n- $\\Delta E_{2,1} = E(2) - E(1) = A \\cdot 2 = 2A$\n\nThe rule thus predicts a specific ratio for these intervals:\n$$\nR_{th} = \\frac{\\Delta E_{2,1}}{\\Delta E_{1,0}} = \\frac{2A}{A} = 2\n$$\nWe must check if the experimental data are consistent with this theoretical ratio of $2$, accounting for the propagation of uncertainties.\n\nFirst, calculate the experimental intervals from the given data:\n$$\n\\Delta E_{1,0} = 15020.18 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1} - 15000.00 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1} = 20.18 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta E_{2,1} = 15059.80 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1} - 15020.18 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1} = 39.62 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\n$$\nThe experimental ratio is:\n$$\nR_{exp} = \\frac{39.62}{20.18} \\approx 1.96333\n$$\nNext, we propagate the uncertainties. Let $y_J = E(J)$ be the measured energies with a uniform uncertainty $u_E = 0.12 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. The intervals are $D = y_1 - y_0$ and $N = y_2 - y_1$. The ratio is $R = N/D$. Since the initial measurements $y_0, y_1, y_2$ are uncorrelated, the uncertainty $u(R)$ is found using partial derivatives:\n$$\nu(R)^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial y_0}\\right)^2 u_E^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial y_1}\\right)^2 u_E^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial y_2}\\right)^2 u_E^2\n$$\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial y_0} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial y_0}\\left(\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{y_1 - y_0}\\right) = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{(y_1 - y_0)^2} = \\frac{N}{D^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial y_1} = \\frac{-1(y_1 - y_0) - (y_2 - y_1)(1)}{(y_1 - y_0)^2} = -\\frac{y_1 - y_0 + y_2 - y_1}{(y_1 - y_0)^2} = -\\frac{y_2-y_0}{D^2} = -\\frac{N+D}{D^2}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial y_2} = \\frac{1}{y_1 - y_0} = \\frac{1}{D}\n$$\nSubstituting these into the uncertainty formula:\n$$\nu(R)^2 = u_E^2 \\left[ \\left(\\frac{N}{D^2}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{N+D}{D^2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{D}\\right)^2 \\right] = \\frac{u_E^2}{D^4} [N^2 + (N+D)^2 + D^2]\n$$\n$$\nu(R)^2 = \\frac{u_E^2}{D^4} [2N^2 + 2ND + 2D^2]\n$$\nUsing the numerical values $N=39.62$, $D=20.18$, and $u_E=0.12$:\n$$\nu(R)^2 = \\frac{(0.12)^2}{(20.18)^4} [2(39.62)^2 + 2(39.62)(20.18) + 2(20.18)^2]\n$$\n$$\nu(R)^2 = \\frac{0.0144}{(20.18)^4} [3139.4888 + 1599.0632 + 814.4648] = \\frac{0.0144}{165836.4} [5553.0168] \\approx 4.819 \\times 10^{-4}\n$$\n$$\nu(R) = \\sqrt{4.819 \\times 10^{-4}} \\approx 0.02195\n$$\nThus, the experimental ratio is $R_{exp} = 1.9633 \\pm 0.0220$. The $1\\sigma$ confidence interval for this ratio is $[1.9413, 1.9853]$. The theoretical value of $2$ lies outside this interval. However, the deviation from theory is $|2 - 1.9633| = 0.0367$. The significance of this deviation, or the Z-score, is the deviation divided by the standard uncertainty:\n$$\nZ = \\frac{|R_{th} - R_{exp}|}{u(R)} = \\frac{0.0367}{0.02195} \\approx 1.67\n$$\nA deviation of $1.67$ standard deviations is not considered statistically significant at conventional levels (e.g., $p=0.05$, which requires $Z > 1.96$). Therefore, we conclude that the data are consistent with the Landé interval rule within the statistical limits of the measurement uncertainties.\n\n**2) Estimation of the Spin-Orbit Constant A**\n\nThe problem requires constructing two estimates of $A$ and combining them.\nEstimate 1, from the $J=0,1$ interval:\n$$\nA_1 = \\Delta E_{1,0} = 20.18 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\n$$\nThe uncertainty $u(A_1)$ is obtained by propagating the uncertainties of $E(1)$ and $E(0)$:\n$$\nu(A_1)^2 = u(E(1))^2 + u(E(0))^2 = (0.12)^2 + (0.12)^2 = 2 \\cdot (0.12)^2 = 0.0288 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\n$$\nSo, $u(A_1) = \\sqrt{0.0288} = 0.12\\sqrt{2} \\approx 0.1697 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n\nEstimate 2, from the $J=1,2$ interval:\n$$\nA_2 = \\frac{\\Delta E_{2,1}}{2} = \\frac{39.62}{2} = 19.81 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\n$$\nThe uncertainty $u(A_2)$ is:\n$$\nu(A_2)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 u(\\Delta E_{2,1})^2 = \\frac{1}{4} [u(E(2))^2 + u(E(1))^2] = \\frac{1}{4}[2 \\cdot (0.12)^2] = \\frac{1}{2}(0.12)^2 = 0.0072 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\n$$\nSo, $u(A_2) = \\sqrt{0.0072} = \\frac{0.12}{\\sqrt{2}} \\approx 0.08485 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$.\n\nThe two estimates are $A_1 = 20.18 \\pm 0.1697 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ and $A_2 = 19.81 \\pm 0.08485 \\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. Note that these estimates are statistically correlated as they both depend on $E(1)$. However, the problem explicitly instructs to combine them using the inverse-variance weighted mean, a method standard for independent variables.
