It is a standard exercise in quantitative chromatographic analysis. We will proceed to solve it.\n\nThe solution is organized in two parts, mirroring the structure of the problem statement.\n\nPart 1: Calculation of Chromatographic Parameters\n\nThe retention factor, or capacity factor, $k'$, is a fundamental measure of an analyte's retention in a chromatographic system. It is defined as the ratio of the time spent by the analyte in the stationary phase to the time spent in the mobile phase. The formula is:\n$$ k' = \\frac{t_R - t_M}{t_M} $$\nwhere $t_R$ is the retention time of the analyte and $t_M$ is the dead time.\n\nUsing the provided data, $t_{M} = 1.20$ min, $t_{R,A} = 3.85$ min, and $t_{R,B} = 4.62$ min, we compute the retention factors for analytes A and B.\n\nFor analyte A:\n$$ k'_{A} = \\frac{t_{R,A} - t_{M}}{t_{M}} = \\frac{3.85 - 1.20}{1.20} = \\frac{2.65}{1.20} \\approx 2.2083 $$\n\nFor analyte B:\n$$ k'_{B} = \\frac{t_{R,B} - t_{M}}{t_{M}} = \\frac{4.62 - 1.20}{1.20} = \\frac{3.42}{1.20} = 2.85 $$\n\nThe selectivity factor, $\\alpha$, quantifies the difference in retention between two analytes. It is defined as the ratio of their retention factors, with the value for the more strongly retained species (B) in the numerator, such that $\\alpha \\ge 1$.\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{k'_{B}}{k'_{A}} $$\nSubstituting the values calculated above:\n$$ \\alpha = \\frac{2.85}{2.2083...} = \\frac{3.42 / 1.20}{2.65 / 1.20} = \\frac{3.42}{2.65} \\approx 1.2906 $$\n\nThe resolution, $R_s$, provides a quantitative measure of the degree of separation between two adjacent peaks, taking into account both their retention times and their widths. The standard formula using baseline peak widths, $w_b$, is:\n$$ R_s = \\frac{2(t_{R,B} - t_{R,A})}{w_{b,A} + w_{b,B}} $$\nThe baseline widths are given as $w_{b,A} = 0.32$ min and $w_{b,B} = 0.36$ min. Substituting the experimental values:\n$$ R_s = \\frac{2(4.62 - 3.85)}{0.32 + 0.36} = \\frac{2(0.77)}{0.68} = \\frac{1.54}{0.68} \\approx 2.2647 $$\nA common criterion for baseline separation in chromatography is $R_s \\ge 1.5$. Our calculated value $R_s \\approx 2.26$ significantly exceeds this threshold, therefore baseline separation is achieved.\n\nPart 2: Prediction of Selectivity Change\n\nThe problem posits that the standard linear solvent strength (LSS) model applies. This model describes the relationship between the logarithm of the retention factor and the volume fraction of the organic modifier, $\\phi$, in the mobile phase:\n$$ \\log_{10}(k') = \\log_{10}(k_w) - S \\phi $$\nHere, $k_w$ is the extrapolated retention factor in pure water ($\\phi=0$) and $S$ is an analyte-specific constant.\n\nTo determine how the selectivity factor $\\alpha$ changes with $\\phi$, we express $\\log_{10}(\\alpha)$ in terms of the LSS model:\n$$ \\log_{10}(\\alpha) = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{k'_{B}}{k'_{A}}\\right) = \\log_{10}(k'_{B}) - \\log_{10}(k'_{A}) $$\nSubstituting the LSS equation for each analyte:\n$$ \\log_{10}(\\alpha) = (\\log_{10}(k_{w,B}) - S_B \\phi) - (\\log_{10}(k_{w,A}) - S_A \\phi) $$\n$$ \\log_{10}(\\alpha) = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{k_{w,B}}{k_{w,A}}\\right) - (S_B - S_A)\\phi $$\nThe given sensitivity parameters are $S_A = 3.8$ and $S_B = 4.4$. The difference is $S_B - S_A = 4.4 - 3.8 = 0.6$. Since $S_B - S_A > 0$, the equation shows that $\\log_{10}(\\alpha)$ is a linearly decreasing function of $\\phi$. Consequently, as $\\phi$ increases, $\\log_{10}(\\alpha)$ decreases, which means $\\alpha$ itself must decrease.\nQualitatively, increasing the organic fraction $\\phi$ from $0.40$ to $0.50$ will **decrease** the selectivity factor $\\alpha$.\n\nTo quantify this change, we can relate the selectivity $\\alpha_{\\text{new}}$ at $\\phi_{\\text{new}} = 0.50$ to the known selectivity $\\alpha_{\\text{old}}$ at $\\phi_{\\text{old}} = 0.40$.\n$$ \\log_{10}(\\alpha_{\\text{new}}) - \\log_{10}(\\alpha_{\\text{old}}) = - (S_B - S_A)(\\phi_{\\text{new}} - \\phi_{\\text{old}}) $$\n$$ \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{\\text{new}}}{\\alpha_{\\text{old}}}\\right) = - (4.4 - 3.8)(0.50 - 0.40) $$\n$$ \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{\\alpha_{\\text{new}}}{\\alpha_{\\text{old}}}\\right) = - (0.6)(0.10) = -0.06 $$\nSolving for the ratio $\\alpha_{\\text{new}}/\\alpha_{\\text{old}}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\alpha_{\\text{new}}}{\\alpha_{\\text{old}}} = 10^{-0.06} \\approx 0.87096 $$\nUsing the value $\\alpha_{\\text{old}} \\approx 1.2906$ calculated in Part 1:\n$$ \\alpha_{\\text{new}} = \\alpha_{\\text{old}} \\times 10^{-0.06} \\approx 1.2906 \\times 0.87096 \\approx 1.1240 $$\nThe selectivity factor at $\\phi = 0.50$ is predicted to be approximately $1.12$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.265}$$", "id": "2945539"}, {"introduction": "After separating analytes chromatographically, the mass spectrometer must ionize them for detection.

It is based on established principles of physical chemistry and mass spectrometry. All necessary data and definitions are provided, and the tasks form a logical sequence for comparing different ionization techniques based on energy transfer. The problem is therefore valid.\n\nThe central task is to compare the internal energy imparted to an analyte molecule, $M$, by three different ionization methods: Electron Ionization (EI), Chemical Ionization (CI) with methane, and Electrospray Ionization (ESI). The method that imparts the least excess internal energy will cause the least fragmentation and thus yield the highest abundance of the intact molecular ion.\n\nFirst, we must convert all relevant energy values to consistent units of kJ/mol. The necessary conversion factors are given as $1$ eV $= 96.485$ kJ/mol and $1$ kcal/mol $= 4.184$ kJ/mol.\n\nThe ionization energy (IE) of the analyte $M$ is given as $9.5$ eV.

The problem states to estimate the excess internal energy imparted to the resulting radical cation $\\mathrm{M^{+\\cdot}}$ as the difference between the electron's kinetic energy and the ionization energy.\n    $$ \\text{Excess Energy} = E_{k}(e^-) - \\mathrm{IE}(M) $$\n    $$ \\text{Excess Energy} = 70 \\text{ eV} - 9.5 \\text{ eV} = 60.5 \\text{ eV} $$\n    Converting this to kJ/mol:\n    $$ \\text{Excess Energy (kJ/mol)} = 60.5 \\text{ eV} \\times 96.485 \\frac{\\text{kJ/mol}}{\\text{eV}} = 5837.3425 \\text{ kJ/mol} $$\n    This is an enormous amount of energy, far exceeding typical covalent bond dissociation energies in organic molecules (which are generally in the range of $300-500$ kJ/mol). This large excess internal energy leads to extensive fragmentation of the molecular ion, making EI a \"hard\" ionization technique, which typically results in a low abundance of the intact $\\mathrm{M^{+\\cdot}}$.\n\n2.  **Chemical Ionization (CI) with Methane**\n    In CI, ionization occurs via a chemical reaction, specifically proton transfer from a reagent ion. Here, the protonating agent is $\\mathrm{CH_5^+}$ produced from methane gas. The reaction is:\n    $$ \\mathrm{CH_5^+ + M \\rightarrow [M+H]^+ + CH_4} $$\n    The spontaneity and exothermicity of this reaction are governed by the standard Gibbs free energy change, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$. We can calculate this using Hess's law and the definition of gas-phase basicity, $\\mathrm{GB}(B) = -\\Delta G^{\\circ}$ for the reaction $\\mathrm{B + H^+ \\rightarrow BH^+}$.\n    We can write the overall reaction as the sum of two steps:\n    1.  $\\mathrm{CH_5^+} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{CH_4 + H^+} \\qquad \\Delta G_1^{\\circ} = \\mathrm{GB(CH_4)}$\n    2.  $\\mathrm{M + H^+} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{[M+H]^+} \\qquad \\Delta G_2^{\\circ} = -\\mathrm{GB(M)}$\n    The total Gibbs free energy change for the proton transfer is:\n    $$ \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{CI}} = \\Delta G_1^{\\circ} + \\Delta G_2^{\\circ} = \\mathrm{GB(CH_4)} - \\mathrm{GB(M)} $$\n    Using the given and calculated values:\n    $$ \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{CI}} = 419 \\text{ kJ/mol} - 878.64 \\text{ kJ/mol} = -459.64 \\text{ kJ/mol} $$\n    The reaction is highly spontaneous (exergonic). The exothermicity of the reaction (approximated by $-\\Delta H^{\\circ}$, which is closely related to $-\\Delta G^{\\circ}$) is transferred as internal energy to the products, primarily the larger product, $\\mathrm{[M+H]^+}$. The internal energy imparted is approximately $460$ kJ/mol. This is a substantial amount of energy, comparable to bond dissociation energies, and will likely cause significant fragmentation.\n\n3.  **Electrospray Ionization (ESI)**\n    The problem simplifies ESI to a gas-phase proton transfer reaction from hydronium, $\\mathrm{H_3O^+}$. The reaction is:\n    $$ \\mathrm{H_3O^+ + M \\rightarrow [M+H]^+ + H_2O} $$\n    The logic for calculating the standard Gibbs free energy change is identical to that for CI:\n    $$ \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{ESI}} = \\mathrm{GB(H_2O)} - \\mathrm{GB(M)} $$\n    Using the given and calculated values:\n    $$ \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{ESI}} = 660 \\text{ kJ/mol} - 878.64 \\text{ kJ/mol} = -218.64 \\text{ kJ/mol} $$\n    This reaction is also spontaneous, but the exothermicity is much lower than in the CI-methane case. The internal energy imparted to the $\\mathrm{[M+H]^+}$ ion is approximately $219$ kJ/mol. This amount of energy is generally insufficient to break strong covalent bonds within typical organic molecules.\n\n**Comparison and Conclusion**\nWe compare the excess internal energy imparted by each method:\n-   EI: $\\approx 5837$ kJ/mol\n-   CI ($\\mathrm{CH_4}$): $\\approx 460$ kJ/mol\n-   ESI ($\\mathrm{H_3O^+}$): $\\approx 219$ kJ/mol\n\nThe extent of fragmentation is directly related to the amount of internal energy deposited in the ion. EI deposits a massive amount of energy, guaranteeing extensive fragmentation and a low signal for the intact molecular ion. Both CI and ESI are \"soft\" ionization methods compared to EI. However, the CI-methane reaction is significantly more exothermic than the ESI reaction considered. The energy imparted by CI-methane is high enough to cause considerable fragmentation, whereas the energy from ESI is low enough that the intact protonated molecule $\\mathrm{[M+H]^+}$ is expected to be the most abundant species.\n\nTherefore, ESI(+) is the method that will yield the highest signal for the intact molecular ion. According to the problem's coding scheme, ESI(+) corresponds to the index $3$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "2945586"}]}
