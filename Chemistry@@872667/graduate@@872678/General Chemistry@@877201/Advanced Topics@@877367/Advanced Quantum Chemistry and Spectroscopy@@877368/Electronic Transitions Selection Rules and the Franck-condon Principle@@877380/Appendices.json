Consider electric-dipole-allowed electronic transitions starting from a ground electronic state of symmetry $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{i}}=A_{1}$ and initial vibrational ground state ($v=0$ for all normal modes). Let the final electronic state symmetry $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{f}}$ be any of $A_{1}$, $A_{2}$, $B_{1}$, or $B_{2}$. Focus on two normal modes: one totally symmetric mode of symmetry $A_{1}$ and one non-totally symmetric mode of symmetry $B_{2}$.

Express your final answer as an integer.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and self-contained. It is a standard application of group theory to molecular spectroscopy and is therefore valid. A rigorous solution will now be provided.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing electric-dipole-allowed transitions is that the transition moment integral, $M$, must be non-zero. Within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, this integral is given by $M = \\langle \\Psi' | \\boldsymbol{\\mu} | \\Psi \\rangle$, where $\\Psi = \\psi_{\\mathrm{el}}\\psi_{\\mathrm{vib}}$ is the total initial wavefunction and $\\Psi' = \\psi'_{\\mathrm{el}}\\psi'_{\\mathrm{vib}}$ is the total final wavefunction. For the integral to be non-zero, the direct product of the irreducible representations (symmetries) of the functions in the integrand, $\\Gamma(\\Psi') \\otimes \\Gamma(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}) \\otimes \\Gamma(\\Psi)$, must contain the totally symmetric representation of the molecule's point group. For the $C_{2v}$ point group, this is the $A_1$ representation.\n\nThe initial electronic state has symmetry $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{i}} = A_1$ and the initial vibrational state is the ground state ($v=0$), which is always totally symmetric. Thus, the symmetry of the initial state wavefunction is $\\Gamma(\\Psi) = \\Gamma(\\psi_{\\mathrm{el}}) \\otimes \\Gamma(\\psi_{\\mathrm{vib}}) = A_1 \\otimes A_1 = A_1$.\n\nThe symmetry of the final state wavefunction is $\\Gamma(\\Psi') = \\Gamma(\\psi'_{\\mathrm{el}}) \\otimes \\Gamma(\\psi'_{\\mathrm{vib}}) = \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{f}} \\otimes \\Gamma(\\psi'_{\\mathrm{vib}})$.\n\nThe general selection rule thus simplifies to:\n$$ (\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{f}} \\otimes \\Gamma(\\psi'_{\\mathrm{vib}})) \\otimes \\Gamma(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}) \\otimes A_1 \\supset A_1 $$\nwhich is equivalent to:\n$$ (\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{f}} \\otimes \\Gamma(\\psi'_{\\mathrm{vib}})) \\otimes \\Gamma(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}) \\supset A_1 $$\nThis holds if and only if the direct product of the final vibronic state symmetry and the dipole moment symmetry is the totally symmetric representation, or equivalently, if $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{f}} \\otimes \\Gamma(\\psi'_{\\mathrm{vib}})$ is equal to the symmetry of one of the components of the electric dipole operator, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$.\n\nFirst, we must identify the symmetries of the electric dipole moment components in the $C_{2v}$ point group. The character table for $C_{2v}$ indicates how the Cartesian coordinates $x, y, z$ transform. Since the components of the dipole moment vector $\\mu_x, \\mu_y, \\mu_z$ transform identically to $x, y, z$, we have:\n- $\\Gamma(\\mu_z) = A_1$ (for light polarized along the principal $z$-axis)\n- $\\Gamma(\\mu_x) = B_1$ (for light polarized along the $x$-axis)\n- $\\Gamma(\\mu_y) = B_2$ (for light polarized along the $y$-axis)\nA transition is allowed if the symmetry of the final vibronic state, $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{f}} \\otimes \\Gamma(\\psi'_{\\mathrm{vib}})$, matches any of $A_1$, $B_1$, or $B_2$.\n\nThe symmetries of the specified final vibrational wavefunctions, $\\psi'_{\\mathrm{vib}}$, are as follows:\n- For $(v'_{A_1}, v'_{B_2}) = (0,0)$: The molecule is in the vibrational ground state. The wavefunction is totally symmetric, so $\\Gamma(\\psi'_{\\mathrm{vib}}) = A_1$.\n- For $(v'_{A_1}, v'_{B_2}) = (1,0)$: The molecule has one quantum of excitation in the totally symmetric $A_1$ mode. The wavefunction symmetry is that of the mode itself, so $\\Gamma(\\psi'_{\\mathrm{vib}}) = A_1$.\n- For $(v'_{A_1}, v'_{B_2}) = (0,1)$: The molecule has one quantum of excitation in the non-totally symmetric $B_2$ mode. The wavefunction symmetry is that of the mode, so $\\Gamma(\\psi'_{\\mathrm{vib}}) = B_2$.\n\nWe now analyze the two cases as requested.\n\n**1. Franck-Condon (Condon) Approximation**\nIn this approximation, the electronic transition dipole moment is assumed to be independent of nuclear coordinates. A transition is allowed if two conditions are met:\n(a) The electronic transition is allowed: $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{i}} \\otimes \\Gamma(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}) \\otimes \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{f}} \\supset A_1$. With $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{i}}=A_1$, this simplifies to $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{f}} = \\Gamma(\\boldsymbol{\\mu})$. Thus, the final electronic state $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{f}}$ must be $A_1$, $B_1$, or $B_2$. The transition to $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{f}} = A_2$ is electronically forbidden.\n(b) The vibrational overlap integral $\\langle \\psi'_{\\mathrm{vib}} | \\psi_{\\mathrm{vib}} \\rangle$ is non-zero. By symmetry, this integral is zero unless the integrand is totally symmetric. Since the initial state $\\psi_{\\mathrm{vib}}$ is totally symmetric ($A_1$), the final state $\\psi'_{\\mathrm{vib}}$ must also be totally symmetric, i.e., $\\Gamma(\\psi'_{\\mathrm{vib}}) = A_1$.\n\nOf the three vibrational cases, only $(0,0)$ and $(1,0)$ have wavefunctions of $A_1$ symmetry. The $(0,1)$ state has $B_2$ symmetry, so its overlap integral with the $A_1$ ground state is zero.\nCombining these conditions, the FC-allowed transitions are:\n- $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{f}} \\in \\{A_1, B_1, B_2\\}$\n- $(v'_{A_1}, v'_{B_2}) \\in \\{(0,0), (1,0)\\}$\nThis gives $3 \\times 2 = 6$ allowed transitions under the Franck-Condon approximation.\n\n**2. Inclusion of Herzberg-Teller Vibronic Coupling**\nHerzberg-Teller theory accounts for the dependence of the electronic transition moment on nuclear coordinates, which allows for vibronically induced transitions. The total number of allowed transitions is determined by the general vibronic selection rule: the product $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{f}} \\otimes \\Gamma(\\psi'_{\\mathrm{vib}})$ must match the symmetry of a dipole component ($A_1$, $B_1$, or $B_2$). This single rule correctly accounts for both FC-allowed transitions and those enabled by HT coupling.\n\nWe systematically examine all $12$ possible transitions:\n\n**Case A: $\\Gamma(\\psi'_{\\mathrm{vib}}) = A_1$ (for final states $(0,0)$ and $(1,0)$)**\nThe vibronic symmetry is $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{f}} \\otimes A_1 = \\Gamma_{\\mathrm{f}}$.\n- If $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{f}} = A_1$: Vibronic symmetry is $A_1$. Allowed (via $\\mu_z$). Both $(0,0)$ and $(1,0)$ cases are allowed. ($2$ transitions)\n- If $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{f}} = A_2$: Vibronic symmetry is $A_2$. Forbidden, as it does not match any dipole component symmetry. ($0$ transitions)\n- If $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{f}} = B_1$: Vibronic symmetry is $B_1$. Allowed (via $\\mu_x$). Both $(0,0)$ and $(1,0)$ cases are allowed. ($2$ transitions)\n- If $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{f}} = B_2$: Vibronic symmetry is $B_2$. Allowed (via $\\mu_y$). Both $(0,0)$ and $(1,0)$ cases are allowed. ($2$ transitions)\nTotal for $\\Gamma(\\psi'_{\\mathrm{vib}}) = A_1$ is $2+0+2+2 = 6$ transitions. These are the FC-allowed transitions.\n\n**Case B: $\\Gamma(\\psi'_{\\mathrm{vib}}) = B_2$ (for final state $(0,1)$)**\nThe vibronic symmetry is $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{f}} \\otimes B_2$. The direct products for $C_{2v}$ are needed: $A_2 \\otimes B_2 = B_1$, $B_1 \\otimes B_2 = A_2$, $B_2 \\otimes B_2 = A_1$.\n- If $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{f}} = A_1$: Vibronic symmetry is $A_1 \\otimes B_2 = B_2$. Allowed (via $\\mu_y$). ($1$ transition)\n- If $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{f}} = A_2$: Vibronic symmetry is $A_2 \\otimes B_2 = B_1$. Allowed (via $\\mu_x$). This is an electronically forbidden transition made possible by vibronic coupling. ($1$ transition)\n- If $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{f}} = B_1$: Vibronic symmetry is $B_1 \\otimes B_2 = A_2$. Forbidden. ($0$ transitions)\n- If $\\Gamma_{\\mathrm{f}} = B_2$: Vibronic symmetry is $B_2 \\otimes B_2 = A_1$. Allowed (via $\\mu_z$). ($1$ transition)\nTotal for $\\Gamma(\\psi'_{\\mathrm{vib}}) = B_2$ is $1+1+0+1 = 3$ transitions. These are enabled by the Herzberg-Teller mechanism.\n\nThe total number of allowed transitions among the $12$ possibilities is the sum of those allowed in Case A and Case B.\nTotal allowed transitions = $6 + 3 = 9$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{9}\n$$", "id": "2937311"}, {"introduction": "Having established the \"all-or-nothing\" rules of symmetry, we now turn to the quantitative intensity distribution within an allowed electronic transition.

The language used is objective and precise, leaving no room for ambiguity. The problem is not trivial, as it requires correct application of the relevant physical principles and formulas.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe intensity $I$ of a vibronic transition between an initial state $|\\Psi_e \\Psi_v \\rangle$ and a final state $|\\Psi_{e'} \\Psi_{v'} \\rangle$ is proportional to the squared magnitude of the transition dipole moment integral:\n$$ I_{v \\to v'} \\propto |\\langle \\Psi_{e'} \\Psi_{v'} | \\hat{\\vec{\\mu}} | \\Psi_e \\Psi_v \\rangle|^2 $$\nwhere $\\hat{\\vec{\\mu}}$ is the electric dipole moment operator.\n\nUnder the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, the total wavefunction is a product of electronic $(\\Psi_e)$ and nuclear (vibrational, $\\Psi_v$) wavefunctions. The integral becomes:\n$$ I_{v \\to v'} \\propto |\\langle \\Psi_{v'} | \\vec{M}_{e'e}(Q) | \\Psi_v \\rangle|^2 $$\nwhere $\\vec{M}_{e'e}(Q) = \\langle \\Psi_{e'}(q;Q) | \\hat{\\vec{\\mu}}_e | \\Psi_e(q;Q) \\rangle_q$ is the electronic transition dipole moment, which is a function of the nuclear coordinates $Q$. The subscript $q$ indicates integration over electronic coordinates only.\n\nThe Condon approximation states that $\\vec{M}_{e'e}(Q)$ is approximately constant with respect to the nuclear coordinate $Q$ over the region where the initial vibrational wavefunction is significant. Thus, we can remove it from the integral:\n$$ I_{v \\to v'} \\propto |\\vec{M}_{e'e}|^2 |\\langle \\Psi_{v'} | \\Psi_v \\rangle|^2 $$\nThe problem states that the transition is electronically allowed, meaning $\\vec{M}_{e'e} \\neq 0$.\n\nThe relative intensities of the different vibronic bands within the same electronic transition are therefore determined by the square of the overlap integral between the initial and final vibrational wavefunctions, $|\\langle \\Psi_{v'} | \\Psi_v \\rangle|^2$. This quantity is known as the Franck-Condon factor (FCF):\n$$ FCF_{v \\to v'} = |\\langle \\Psi_{v'} | \\Psi_v \\rangle|^2 $$\nSince the problem asks for intensities to be treated as normalized probabilities, and the sum of all FCFs from a given initial state is unity ($\\sum_{v'} FCF_{v \\to v'} = 1$), the normalized intensity is equal to the Franck-Condon factor:\n$$ I_{v \\to v'} = FCF_{v \\to v'} $$\n\nFor a displaced harmonic oscillator model with equal frequencies for both electronic states, the Franck-Condon factors for transitions originating from the ground vibrational state ($v=0$) are given by a Poisson distribution involving the Huang-Rhys factor $S$:\n$$ I_{0 \\to v'} = FCF_{0 \\to v'} = \\frac{\\exp(-S) S^{v'}}{v'!} $$\nThe Huang-Rhys factor $S$ is a dimensionless measure of the geometric displacement between the potential energy surfaces, related to the reorganization energy.

We examine the ratio of successive terms:\n$$ \\frac{I_{0 \\to v'+1}}{I_{0 \\to v'}} = \\frac{\\exp(-S)S^{v'+1}/(v'+1)!}{\\exp(-S)S^{v'}/v'!} = \\frac{S}{v'+1} $$\nThe intensity increases as long as this ratio is greater than $1$, and decreases when it is less than $1$.\nThe maximum occurs when the function transitions from increasing to decreasing.\nLet's analyze the ratio for $S=1.5$:\n$$ \\frac{I_{0 \\to v'+1}}{I_{0 \\to v'}} = \\frac{1.5}{v'+1} $$\nFor $v'=0$: The ratio is $\\frac{1.5}{0+1} = 1.5 > 1$, so $I_{0 \\to 1} > I_{0 \\to 0}$.\nFor $v'=1$: The ratio is $\\frac{1.5}{1+1} = 0.75  1$, so $I_{0 \\to 2}  I_{0 \\to 1}$.\nThe sequence of intensities increases from $v'=0$ to $v'=1$ and then decreases for all subsequent $v'$.

An estimator using information from all data points is preferable. One could average the two estimates. A more robust estimator can be derived from the ratio of the $I_2$ and $I_0$ bands, as this uses the full span of the data and is less sensitive to a single erroneous measurement of $I_1$.\n$$ \\frac{I_2}{I_0} = \\frac{C S^2/2 \\cdot \\exp(-S)}{C \\exp(-S)} = \\frac{S^2}{2} $$\nThis gives the estimator $S = \\sqrt{2 (I_2 / I_0)}$. This estimator is also equivalent to the geometric mean of the first two estimators, $\\sqrt{S_{01} \\cdot S_{12}}$, and is therefore a well-justified choice for combining the information.\n\nWe now calculate this value as our best estimate:\n$$ S = \\sqrt{2 \\cdot \\frac{2.32}{2.72}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4.64}{2.72}} \\approx \\sqrt{1.70588235...} \\approx 1.3060943... $$\nRounding this result to four significant figures, as required, gives $1.306$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.306}$$", "id": "2937291"}]}
