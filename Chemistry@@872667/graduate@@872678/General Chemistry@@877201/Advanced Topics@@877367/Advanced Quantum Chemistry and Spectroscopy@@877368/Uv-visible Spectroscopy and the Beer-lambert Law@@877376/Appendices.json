Begin from the definition of decadic absorbance as $A \\equiv -\\log_{10}(T)$, where $T$ is the transmittance $T \\equiv I/I_{0}$, and the empirical fact that, for a homogeneous medium, attenuation is proportional to the number of absorbers intersected by the beam and to the optical path length, to show that the absorbance is proportional to both the solute concentration and the cuvette path length.

It is therefore deemed valid. The solution proceeds in two parts: first, a theoretical derivation as requested, and second, the uncertainty propagation analysis.\n\nFirst, we derive the Beer-Lambert law from the provided empirical principle. Let a beam of monochromatic radiation with initial intensity $I_{0}$ pass through a homogeneous absorbing solution. Consider an infinitesimally thin slab of the solution of thickness $dl$ perpendicular to the beam. The empirical fact states that the fractional decrease in intensity, $-dI/I$, upon traversing this slab is proportional to the number of absorbers per unit area in the slab. The number of absorbers in a volume element $S \\cdot dl$, where $S$ is the cross-sectional area of the beam, is proportional to the molar concentration $c$ and the volume itself. Thus, the number of absorbers per unit area is proportional to $c \\cdot dl$.\n\nThis leads to the differential equation:\n$$-\\frac{dI}{I} = k' c \\, dl$$\nwhere $k'$ is a proportionality constant characteristic of the absorbing species and the wavelength, and $c$ is the molar concentration. The negative sign signifies that the intensity decreases as the path length increases.\n\nTo find the total attenuation over a finite path length $b$, we integrate this expression. Let the intensity of the incident beam be $I_{0}$ at path length $l=0$ and the transmitted intensity be $I$ at path length $l=b$. We assume the concentration $c$ is uniform throughout the medium.\n$$\\int_{I_{0}}^{I} \\frac{dI}{I} = -k' c \\int_{0}^{b} dl$$\nPerforming the integration yields:\n$$\\ln(I) - \\ln(I_{0}) = -k' c b$$\n$$\\ln\\left(\\frac{I}{I_{0}}\\right) = -k' c b$$\nThe quantity $T \\equiv I/I_{0}$ is defined as the transmittance. The problem defines decadic absorbance as $A \\equiv -\\log_{10}(T)$. We convert the natural logarithm ($\\ln$) to the base-10 logarithm ($\\log_{10}$) using the identity $\\ln(x) = \\ln(10) \\log_{10}(x)$:\n$$\\ln(10) \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{I}{I_{0}}\\right) = -k' c b$$\n$$\\log_{10}(T) = -\\frac{k'}{\\ln(10)} c b$$\nSubstituting the definition of absorbance $A$:\n$$-A = -\\frac{k'}{\\ln(10)} c b$$\n$$A = \\left(\\frac{k'}{\\ln(10)}\\right) c b$$\nWe define the molar decadic proportionality factor, or molar absorptivity, as $\\varepsilon \\equiv k'/\\ln(10)$. This constant consolidates the intrinsic absorbing properties of the solute at the specific wavelength $\\lambda$. The equation thus becomes:\n$$A = \\varepsilon b c$$\nThis is the Beer-Lambert law. It shows that absorbance $A$ is directly proportional to both the solute concentration $c$ and the path length $b$, as required. For a fixed path length $b$, the relationship between absorbance and concentration is linear: $A = (\\varepsilon b) c$. This justifies a linear calibration model of the form $A = m c$, where the line passes through the origin ($A=0$ for $c=0$) and the slope is $m = \\varepsilon b$.\n\nNow, we proceed with the uncertainty analysis tasks.\n\nTask 1: Derive the calibration slope $m$ and its standard uncertainty $u_m$.\nThe slope of the calibration curve $A$ versus $c$ is $m = \\varepsilon b$. The variables $\\varepsilon$ and $b$ are given as independent. We use the first-order Taylor series expansion (Gaussian) method for uncertainty propagation. For a function $m = f(\\varepsilon, b)$, the squared standard uncertainty $u_m^2$ is given by:\n$$u_m^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\partial m}{\\partial \\varepsilon}\\right)^2 u_{\\varepsilon}^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial m}{\\partial b}\\right)^2 u_{b}^2$$\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$$\\frac{\\partial m}{\\partial \\varepsilon} = b \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial m}{\\partial b} = \\varepsilon$$\nSubstituting these into the uncertainty formula gives:\n$$u_m^2 = b^2 u_{\\varepsilon}^2 + \\varepsilon^2 u_{b}^2$$\nFor convenience, we can express this in terms of relative uncertainties. Dividing by $m^2 = (\\varepsilon b)^2$:\n$$\\frac{u_m^2}{m^2} = \\frac{b^2 u_{\\varepsilon}^2}{(\\varepsilon b)^2} + \\frac{\\varepsilon^2 u_{b}^2}{(\\varepsilon b)^2}$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{u_m}{m}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{u_{\\varepsilon}}{\\varepsilon}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{u_{b}}{b}\\right)^2$$\nThis is the required expression for the uncertainty of the slope $m$.\n\nTask 2: Derive the combined standard uncertainty $u_c$.\nThe concentration $c$ is determined from the measured absorbance $A$ and the calculated slope $m$ using the model $c = A/m$. The variables $A$ and $m$ are independent, as $A$ is from the measurement of the unknown solution and $m$ is derived from literature data and instrument specifications. We apply the same uncertainty propagation method for $c=g(A, m)$:\n$$u_c^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial A}\\right)^2 u_{A}^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial m}\\right)^2 u_{m}^2$$\nThe partial derivatives are:\n$$\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial A} = \\frac{1}{m} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial m} = -\\frac{A}{m^2}$$\nSubstituting these into the uncertainty formula:\n$$u_c^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{m}\\right)^2 u_{A}^2 + \\left(-\\frac{A}{m^2}\\right)^2 u_{m}^2 = \\frac{u_A^2}{m^2} + \\frac{A^2 u_m^2}{m^4}$$\nDividing by $c^2 = (A/m)^2$ to find the relative uncertainty:\n$$\\frac{u_c^2}{c^2} = \\frac{u_A^2/m^2}{(A/m)^2} + \\frac{A^2 u_m^2/m^4}{(A/m)^2} = \\frac{u_A^2}{A^2} + \\frac{u_m^2}{m^2}$$\n$$\\left(\\frac{u_c}{c}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{u_{A}}{A}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{u_{m}}{m}\\right)^2$$\nThis is the required expression for the uncertainty of the concentration $c$.\n\nTask 3: Evaluate $u_c$ numerically.\nWe have the combined relative uncertainty expression:\n$$\\left(\\frac{u_c}{c}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{u_{A}}{A}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{u_{\\varepsilon}}{\\varepsilon}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{u_{b}}{b}\\right)^2$$\nFirst, we determine the standard uncertainty of the path length, $u_b$.

It is a valid problem in instrumental analytical chemistry. We will proceed with the derivation and calculation.\n\nThe solution is structured into three parts as requested: an experimental protocol, a formal derivation of the correction formula, and the application of this formula to calculate the corrected molar absorptivity.\n\nFirst, we establish a physical model for the measurement. Let the radiant power of the monochromatic light source at the target wavelength, after passing through the blank cuvette, be $P_0$. Let the radiant power of stray light reaching the detector be $P_s$. We assume $P_s$ is constant across measurements of the blank, the filter, and the sample. The detector response is proportional to the total radiant power incident upon it.\n\nThe instrument normalizes measurements by first recording a signal from a blank (solvent-only cuvette) and defining this as $100\\%$ transmittance. The total radiant power at the detector for the blank is $P_{det, blank} = P_0 + P_s$.\n\nWhen a sample with true transmittance $T_{true}$ is measured, the monochromatic light is attenuated to $T_{true} P_0$. The total radiant power at the detector is $P_{det, sample} = T_{true} P_0 + P_s$.\n\nThe measured transmittance, $T_{meas}$, is the ratio of the sample signal to the blank signal:\n$$T_{meas} = \\frac{P_{det, sample}}{P_{det, blank}} = \\frac{T_{true} P_0 + P_s}{P_0 + P_s}$$\n\nThis equation forms the basis of our analysis.\n\n**Part 1: Experimental Protocol to Estimate Stray Light**\n\nThe problem requires an experimental protocol to estimate the fraction of stray light. This is accomplished using the provided cut-off filter, for which the true transmittance at $300\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ is given as $T_{true, filter} = 0$.\n\n1.  Set the spectrophotometer to the target wavelength, $\\lambda = 300\\ \\mathrm{nm}$.\n2.  Insert a cuvette containing the pure solvent (the blank) into the sample holder.\n3.  Perform the instrument's blanking or zeroing procedure. This records the reference power $P_0 + P_s$ and sets the instrument baseline to $100\\%$ transmittance ($T=1$) or $0$ absorbance ($A=0$).\n4.  Remove the blank cuvette and place the cut-off filter in the light path.\n5.  Measure the transmittance of the filter. This value is the measured transmittance of the filter, which we denote as $T_f$.\n\nThis measured value, $T_f$, represents the stray light fraction relative to the total radiant power of the blank measurement. By substituting $T_{true} = 0$ into our fundamental equation, we see:\n$$T_f = \\frac{(0) \\cdot P_0 + P_s}{P_0 + P_s} = \\frac{P_s}{P_0 + P_s}$$\nThus, the experimental measurement of the opaque filter's transmittance directly yields the parameter needed for the correction.\n\n**Part 2: Derivation of the Correction Formula**\n\nWe must derive an expression for the true transmittance, $T_{true}$, in terms of the measured transmittance, $T_{meas}$, and the stray-light parameter determined in Part 1. The stray-light parameter is $T_f = \\frac{P_s}{P_0 + P_s}$.\n\nWe start with the general expression for measured transmittance:\n$$T_{meas} = \\frac{T_{true} P_0 + P_s}{P_0 + P_s}$$\nWe can rewrite this expression as:\n$$T_{meas} = T_{true} \\left( \\frac{P_0}{P_0 + P_s} \\right) + \\left( \\frac{P_s}{P_0 + P_s} \\right)$$\nFrom Part 1, we know the second term is simply $T_f$. The first term's fraction can be expressed in terms of $T_f$ as well:\n$$\\frac{P_0}{P_0 + P_s} = \\frac{(P_0 + P_s) - P_s}{P_0 + P_s} = 1 - \\frac{P_s}{P_0 + P_s} = 1 - T_f$$\nSubstituting these back into the expression for $T_{meas}$, we obtain a simple linear relationship:\n$$T_{meas} = T_{true} (1 - T_f) + T_f$$\nThis equation relates the measured transmittance to the true transmittance and the experimentally determined stray light fraction $T_f$.\n\nTo find the desired correction formula, we rearrange this equation to solve for $T_{true}$:\n$$T_{meas} - T_f = T_{true} (1 - T_f)$$\n$$T_{true} = \\frac{T_{meas} - T_f}{1 - T_f}$$\nThis is the required analytic expression that recovers the true sample transmittance from the measured transmittance and the measured transmittance of the cut-off filter.\n\n**Part 3: Application and Calculation**\n\nWe now apply this formula to the provided data to find the corrected molar absorptivity ($\\epsilon$).\n\nThe given data at $\\lambda = 300\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ are:\n-   Measured transmittance of the cut-off filter, $T_f = 0.00400$.\n-   Measured transmittance of the sample solution, $T_{meas, sample} = 0.00600$.\n-   Analyte concentration, $c = 1.000 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ L^{-1}}$.\n-   Path length, $b = 1.000\\ \\mathrm{cm}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the true transmittance of the sample, $T_{true, sample}$:\n$$T_{true, sample} = \\frac{T_{meas, sample} - T_f}{1 - T_f} = \\frac{0.00600 - 0.00400}{1 - 0.00400} = \\frac{0.00200}{0.996}$$\n$$T_{true, sample} \\approx 0.0020080321$$\n\nNext, we calculate the true absorbance, $A_{true, sample}$, using its definition:\n$$A_{true, sample} = -\\log_{10}(T_{true, sample})$$\n$$A_{true, sample} = -\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{0.00200}{0.996}\\right) \\approx -\\log_{10}(0.0020080321)$$\n$$A_{true, sample} \\approx 2.697200$$\n\nFinally, we use the Beer-Lambert law, $A = \\epsilon b c$, to calculate the corrected molar absorptivity, $\\epsilon$:\n$$\\epsilon = \\frac{A_{true, sample}}{b c}$$\nSubstituting the values:\n$$\\epsilon = \\frac{2.697200}{(1.000\\ \\mathrm{cm}) \\times (1.000 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ L^{-1}})}$$\n$$\\epsilon = 26972.00\\ \\mathrm{L\\ mol^{-1}\\ cm^{-1}}$$\n\nThe problem requires the final result to be rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\\epsilon = 26970\\ \\mathrm{L\\ mol^{-1}\\ cm^{-1}}$$\nExpressed in standard scientific notation, this is $2.697 \\times 10^4\\ \\mathrm{L\\ mol^{-1}\\ cm^{-1}}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.697 \\times 10^{4}}$$", "id": "2963025"}, {"introduction": "This final practice elevates the use of spectroscopy from a simple measurement tool to a method for investigating complex chemical systems.

The total absorbance $A(x)$ at a given mole fraction $x$ is:\n$$A(x) = b \\left( \\epsilon_A [A] + \\epsilon_B [B] + \\epsilon_{AB} [AB] \\right)$$\nUsing the mass balance equations $[A] = [A]_0 - [AB] = C_T x - [AB]$ and $[B] = [B]_0 - [AB] = C_T(1-x) - [AB]$, we can rewrite the absorbance as:\n$$A(x) = b \\left( \\epsilon_A (C_T x - [AB]) + \\epsilon_B (C_T(1-x) - [AB]) + \\epsilon_{AB} [AB] \\right)$$\n$$A(x) = b \\left( \\epsilon_A C_T x + \\epsilon_B C_T(1-x) \\right) + b [AB] \\left( \\epsilon_{AB} - \\epsilon_A - \\epsilon_B \\right)$$\nThe first term represents the absorbance that would be observed if no complex formation occurred, which is a linear baseline connecting the absorbance at $x=0$ (pure $B$) and $x=1$ (pure $A$). Let this be $A_{baseline}(x)$. The second term, $Y(x)$, represents the deviation from this baseline due to complex formation.\n$$Y(x) = A(x) - A_{baseline}(x) = b [AB] \\Delta\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{rxn}}$$\nwhere $\\Delta\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{rxn}} = \\epsilon_{AB} - \\epsilon_A - \\epsilon_B$. A proper Job's plot displays $Y(x)$ versus $x$. The extremum of this plot occurs where $[AB]$ is maximal, which for a $1{:}1$ complex is at $x=0.5$.\n\nWe evaluate the magnitude of the parameters. The product $K_{\\mathrm{f}} C_T = (1.00 \\times 10^2\\,\\mathrm{M^{-1}})(1.00 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{M}) = 0.01$. Since $K_{\\mathrm{f}} C_T \\ll 1$, the binding is very weak. The concentration of the complex $[AB]$ will be small. We can approximate $[AB] \\approx K_{\\mathrm{f}}[A][B] \\approx K_{\\mathrm{f}} (C_T x)(C_T(1-x)) = K_{\\mathrm{f}}C_T^2 x(1-x)$.\nThe maximum concentration of the complex occurs at $x=0.5$:\n$$[AB]_{\\mathrm{max}} \\approx (1.00 \\times 10^2) (1.00 \\times 10^{-4})^2 (0.5)(0.5) = 2.5 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{M}$$\nThis is a very low concentration. The change in molar absorptivity for the reaction is:\n$$\\Delta\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{rxn}} = (1.05 \\times 10^4) - (1.00 \\times 10^4) - (1.10 \\times 10^4) = -1.05 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{L\\,mol^{-1}\\,cm^{-1}}$$\nThe maximum deviation from the baseline is:\n$$Y_{\\mathrm{max}} = (1.00\\,\\mathrm{cm})(2.5 \\times 10^{-7}\\,\\mathrm{mol\\,L^{-1}})(-1.05 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{L\\,mol^{-1}\\,cm^{-1}}) \\approx -0.0026$$\nThis is a very small absorbance change. The baseline absorbance at $x=0.5$ is:\n$$A_{baseline}(0.5) = (1.00\\,\\mathrm{cm})(1.00 \\times 10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{M}) \\left( (1.00 \\times 10^4) \\times 0.5 + (1.10 \\times 10^4) \\times 0.5 \\right) = 1.05$$\nThe change in absorbance is only about $0.25\\%$ of the background signal. This deviation is difficult to measure accurately, rendering the extremum in the Job's plot indistinct and susceptible to experimental noise.\n\nNow, we evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. When $\\epsilon_A(\\lambda_0)$, $\\epsilon_B(\\lambda_0)$, and $\\epsilon_{AB}(\\lambda_0)$ are similar, the absorbance change upon complexation at $\\lambda_0$ is small compared to the baseline from uncomplexed species, so the Job’s-plot maximum is indistinct. Recording full spectra over several wavelengths and globally fitting to an equilibrium model by non-linear least squares (NLLS) can recover stoichiometry even for weak binding.**\nThe first part of the statement is confirmed by our calculation. The weak binding ($K_{\\mathrm{f}}C_T \\ll 1$) leads to a very small $[AB]$, and thus a small signal $Y(x)$, which is difficult to distinguish from the large, sloping background absorbance of the free species. The second part is a statement of best practice. Global analysis of multi-wavelength data uses the entirety of the spectral information, is more robust to noise, and can resolve contributions from different species even with severe spectral overlap. By fitting the data to different stoichiometric models (e.g., $1{:}1$, $1{:}2$), one can determine the most plausible stoichiometry. This approach is powerful and well-suited for challenging systems like the one described.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. For weak equilibria at fixed $C_T$, a Job’s plot is always reliable if one plots the raw absorbance $A(\\lambda_0)$ versus $x$ without any baseline subtraction; the maximum necessarily occurs at the true stoichiometric mole fraction, independently of the values of $\\epsilon_A(\\lambda_0)$ and $\\epsilon_B(\\lambda_0)$.**\nThis statement is false. The raw absorbance is $A(x) = A_{baseline}(x) + Y(x)$. The extremum of $A(x)$ is found by setting its derivative to zero: $\\frac{dA}{dx} = \\frac{d A_{baseline}}{dx} + \\frac{dY}{dx} = 0$.\nThe baseline derivative is $\\frac{d A_{baseline}}{dx} = b C_T (\\epsilon_A - \\epsilon_B)$. The derivative of the signal part is $\\frac{dY}{dx} = b \\Delta\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{rxn}} \\frac{d[AB]}{dx}$. At the stoichiometric mole fraction $x=0.5$ (for a $1{:}1$ complex), $\\frac{d[AB]}{dx}=0$, so $\\frac{dY}{dx}=0$. The derivative of the total absorbance at this point is $\\frac{dA}{dx}|_{x=0.5} = b C_T (\\epsilon_A - \\epsilon_B)$. This is zero only if $\\epsilon_A = \\epsilon_B$. In the given problem, $\\epsilon_A \\neq \\epsilon_B$, so the slope of the baseline is non-zero. This non-zero slope shifts the position of the extremum of the total absorbance $A(x)$ away from the true stoichiometric point $x=0.5$. Therefore, plotting raw absorbance is not a reliable method to find stoichiometry unless $\\epsilon_A = \\epsilon_B$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Spectrophotometric titration at multiple wavelengths, combined with global fitting and model comparison between $1{:}1$ and $1{:}2$ binding schemes, can reveal stoichiometry, whereas single-wavelength Benesi–Hildebrand analysis presumes a stoichiometry and can mislead when spectral differences are small. Therefore, multiwavelength global analysis is preferable when spectra overlap.**\nThis statement accurately compares a modern, robust methodology with an older, problematic one. Spectrophotometric titration combined with global NLLS fitting of multi-wavelength data is the gold standard for determining binding models and parameters. Comparing the fit quality for different models ($1{:}1$, $1{:}2$, etc.) is the primary way to establish stoichiometry. In contrast, the Benesi–Hildebrand method is a linearization technique for single-wavelength data that strictly assumes a $1{:}1$ stoichiometry and is known to produce unreliable results, particularly with noisy data or small signal changes. The conclusion that global analysis is preferable is therefore correct.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Because the Beer–Lambert law scales all species equally with $b$, increasing the path length $b$ cannot improve the detectability of complex formation in a Job’s plot; path-length adjustments are ineffective in this context.**\nThis statement is incorrect. Detectability depends on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The signal of interest is $Y(x)$, which is directly proportional to the path length $b$. While the baseline absorbance also scales with $b$, the instrumental noise does not necessarily scale in the same way. For a system where the total absorbance is low and the limiting noise source is, for example, constant electronic noise, increasing $b$ will increase the signal $Y(x)$ and thus improve the SNR. The claim \"cannot improve\" is an absolute that can be falsified by a counterexample. If the total concentration $C_T$ were $10$ times lower, the initial absorbance at $b=1\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ would be approx. $0.1$. Increasing $b$ to $10\\,\\mathrm{cm}$ would raise the absorbance to the optimal range of $\\approx 1$ and increase the signal $Y(x)$ by a factor of $10$, almost certainly improving detectability. While in the specific case given ($A \\approx 1.1$), further increasing $b$ may be detrimental by pushing the absorbance into a non-linear, high-noise regime, the general statement that path-length adjustments are ineffective is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The molar ratio method (holding $[A]_0$ constant while titrating $B$) at total concentrations on the order of or exceeding $1/K_{\\mathrm{f}}$, combined with difference spectroscopy at wavelengths where the absolute change in molar absorptivity $|\\Delta \\epsilon(\\lambda)|$ is largest, can overcome low contrast and yield reliable stoichiometry.**\nThis statement describes a valid and effective experimental strategy. The condition $C \\gtrsim 1/K_{\\mathrm{f}}$ drives the equilibrium to favor the complex, shifting from a weak-binding regime to a titration regime where the reaction is nearly quantitative. With $[A]_0$ fixed and $B$ added, a plot of absorbance versus the molar ratio $[B]_0/[A]_0$ will exhibit a sharp break or change in slope at the stoichiometric ratio. This makes for an unambiguous determination of stoichiometry. Combining this with difference spectroscopy at a wavelength of maximum spectral change $(|\\Delta\\epsilon(\\lambda)|_{max})$ maximizes the observed signal. In this problem, $1/K_{\\mathrm{f}} = 1/(100\\,\\mathrm{M^{-1}}) = 0.01\\,\\mathrm{M}$. Performing the titration at such concentrations, much higher than the $10^{-4}\\,\\mathrm{M}$ in the problem, is an excellent way to determine stoichiometry.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**F. If spectra of free and complexed species overlap strongly, applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to full-spectrum data can establish the number of absorbing species; this information, together with equilibrium fits, can disambiguate stoichiometry when Job’s plots are ambiguous.**\nThis statement is correct. SVD and PCA are powerful chemometric tools for analyzing multivariate data, such as a series of spectra from a titration or Job's plot experiment. A key output is the number of significant principal components (or singular values), which corresponds to the number of linearly independent absorbing species in the system. This model-free information is crucial. For example, if SVD indicates three species, it validates testing three-species models (like $A+B \\rightleftharpoons AB$ or $A+2B \\rightleftharpoons AB_2$) while invalidating two-species models (like dimerization $2A \\rightleftharpoons A_2$). While this number does not by itself give the stoichiometry, it provides a critical constraint for subsequent equilibrium model fitting, thereby helping to disambiguate the reaction scheme.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACEF}$$", "id": "2962957"}]}
