This is a fundamental exercise in physical chemistry. The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. We shall proceed with the derivation and analysis.\n\nThe system is defined by a set of intensive variables. The task is to find the number of these variables that can be independently specified, which is the definition of the degrees of freedom, $f$.\n\nFirst, we enumerate the total number of intensive variables required to describe the system before considering the constraints imposed by equilibrium. The system consists of $P$ phases and $C$ components. In this specific problem, the number of components is given as $C=3$. The intensive state of each phase $j$ is defined by its composition, temperature $T$, and pressure $P$. The composition of a phase with $C$ components is specified by $C-1$ independent mole fractions, as the sum of mole fractions must be unity: $\\sum_{i=1}^{C} x_{i}^{(j)} = 1$.\n\nFor a system of $P$ phases, the total number of composition variables is $P(C-1)$. The system as a whole is also characterized by a single temperature $T$ and a single pressure $P$, as it is in thermal and mechanical equilibrium.\nTherefore, the total number of intensive variables is $V = P(C-1) + 2$.\n\nNext, we enumerate the constraints imposed by the condition of chemical equilibrium. For each component $i$, its chemical potential $\\mu_i$ must be the same in all coexisting phases.\n$$\n\\mu_{i}^{(1)} = \\mu_{i}^{(2)} = \\dots = \\mu_{i}^{(P)}\n$$\nFor each of the $C$ components, this set of equalities provides $P-1$ independent equations. For example, $\\mu_{i}^{(1)} = \\mu_{i}^{(2)}$, $\\mu_{i}^{(1)} = \\mu_{i}^{(3)}$, and so on.\nThe total number of equilibrium constraints is therefore $E = C(P-1)$.\n\nThe number of degrees of freedom, $f$, is the difference between the total number of variables and the total number of constraints:\n$$\nf = V - E = [P(C-1) + 2] - [C(P-1)]\n$$\nExpanding this expression, we get:\n$$\nf = PC - P + 2 - PC + C = C - P + 2\n$$\nThis is the general form of the Gibbs phase rule.\n\nThe problem statement specifies that the system is held at isothermal and isobaric conditions. This means that temperature $T$ and pressure $P$ are fixed externally and are not treated as degrees of freedom. This imposes two additional constraints on the system. Alternatively, we can calculate the reduced or condensed degrees of freedom, which we will denote as $f'$, for a system at fixed $T$ and $P$.\n$$\nf' = f - 2 = (C - P + 2) - 2 = C - P\n$$\nThe problem specifies a ternary mixture, for which $C=3$. Substituting this value into our expression for the reduced degrees of freedom gives the final functional form for $f(P)$:\n$$\nf(P) = 3 - P\n$$\nThis is the expression sought. Now, we analyze its implications.\n\nThe number of degrees of freedom, $f$, must be a non-negative integer ($f \\ge 0$), as it is a count of independent variables. This fundamental physical requirement imposes a constraint on the number of phases $P$ that can coexist in equilibrium:\n$$\n3 - P \\ge 0 \\implies P \\le 3\n$$\nThis result, known as the Duhem theorem for this specific case, proves that for a three-component system at fixed temperature and pressure, a maximum of three phases can coexist in equilibrium. Let us examine the permissible phase multiplicities:\n\nCase 1: $P=1$ (Single-phase, homogeneous region).\nFor a single phase, $f = 3 - 1 = 2$.\nThere are two degrees of freedom. At fixed $T$ and $P$, these must be composition variables. The composition of a ternary system is described by mole fractions $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ subject to the constraint $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 1$. Thus, we can independently specify two mole fractions (e.g., $x_1$ and $x_2$) to fix the intensive state of the system. In a graphical representation, such as a ternary composition diagram (e.g., a Gibbs triangle), this two-dimensional freedom corresponds to an area. Any point within this area represents a possible homogeneous liquid state.\n\nCase 2: $P=2$ (Two-phase, heterogeneous region).\nFor two coexisting phases, $f = 3 - 2 = 1$.\nThere is one degree of freedom. This means that if we specify a single intensive variable, the intensive state of the entire system, including the compositions of both phases, is fixed. For example, if we specify the mole fraction of component $1$ in phase $1$, $x_1^{(1)}$, then the mole fractions of all other components in both phases, $(x_2^{(1)}, x_3^{(1)})$ and $(x_1^{(2)}, x_2^{(2)}, x_3^{(2)})$, are determined.\nIn the ternary diagram, the compositions of two coexisting phases are given by two points, one for each phase. The line segment connecting these two points is called a tie-line. The fact that $f=1$ means that there is a one-parameter family of such tie-lines that sweep across or \"tile\" the two-phase region of the diagram. The overall composition of any system within this region will lie on a tie-line, and the system will separate into the two phases whose compositions are at the ends of that tie-line.\n\nCase 3: $P=3$ (Three-phase, heterogeneous region).\nFor three coexisting phases, $f = 3 - 3 = 0$.\nThere are zero degrees of freedom. Such a system is invariant. At a given $T$ and $P$, the compositions of the three phases in equilibrium are fixed and cannot be varied. Any attempt to change the composition of any phase (e.g., by adding more of one component) will cause one of the phases to disappear until the system state moves into a two-phase or single-phase region.\nGraphically, the three fixed compositions form the vertices of a tie-triangle in the ternary diagram. Any system with an overall composition falling inside this triangle will separate into the three phases with the compositions defined by the vertices.\n\nIn summary, the derived rule $f = 3 - P$ governs the structure of the phase diagram for a ternary system at constant $T$ and $P$. It distinguishes between homogeneous states ($P=1$, $f=2$, corresponding to areas) and heterogeneous states ($P > 1$). For heterogeneous states, it further quantifies their structure: two-phase regions ($P=2$, $f=1$) are parameterized by tie-lines, and three-phase equilibrium ($P=3$, $f=0$) corresponds to a single invariant state represented by a tie-triangle. The maximum number of phases is strictly limited to $3$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3-P}\n$$", "id": "2928525"}, {"introduction": "Real mixtures rarely behave ideally, and classifying their behavior requires models that account for intermolecular interactions.

A solution will be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Solution**\n\nThe analysis is performed in two parts: first, determining the deviation from Raoult's law, and second, classifying the azeotropic behavior.\n\n**1. Deviation from Raoult's Law**\nThe nature of deviation from Raoult's law is determined by the sign of the excess Gibbs energy, $g^{\\mathrm{E}}$. A positive $g^{\\mathrm{E}}$ indicates positive deviations, while a negative $g^{\\mathrm{E}}$ indicates negative deviations. The given expression for the excess Gibbs energy per mole is:\n$$ \\frac{g^{\\mathrm{E}}}{R T} = x_1 x_2 \\left(A_{12} x_1 + A_{21} x_2\\right) $$\nThe provided parameters are $A_{12} = 1.2$ and $A_{21} = 1.0$. Both are positive. For a binary mixture, the mole fractions $x_1$ and $x_2$ are constrained to be in the interval $[0, 1]$, with $x_1+x_2 = 1$. For any composition other than the pure components (i.e., for $x_1 \\in (0,1)$), both $x_1$ and $x_2$ are strictly positive. The universal gas constant $R$ and the absolute temperature $T = 350\\ \\mathrm{K}$ are also positive.\n\nThe term $(A_{12} x_1 + A_{21} x_2)$ is a sum of products of positive numbers, specifically $(1.2 x_1 + 1.0 x_2)$, which is always positive for $x_1, x_2 \\in [0,1]$ unless both are zero (which is not possible).\nTherefore, for any composition of the mixture where $0  x_1  1$:\n$$ \\frac{g^{\\mathrm{E}}}{R T} = \\underbrace{x_1}_{0} \\underbrace{x_2}_{0} \\underbrace{\\left(A_{12} x_1 + A_{21} x_2\\right)}_{0}  0 $$\nSince $g^{\\mathrm{E}}$ is positive throughout the entire composition range (except at the pure-component limits where it is zero), the mixture exhibits **positive deviations from Raoult's law**. This implies that the activity coefficients, $\\gamma_1$ and $\\gamma_2$, are greater than $1$ for all compositions, and the total pressure $P$ of the mixture is greater than the pressure predicted by Raoult's law, $P^{\\mathrm{ideal}} = x_1 P_1^{\\mathrm{sat}} + x_2 P_2^{\\mathrm{sat}}$.\n\n**2. Azeotropy Classification**\nAn azeotrope occurs at a composition where the liquid and vapor phases are identical, meaning $x_i = y_i$. This condition is equivalent to the relative volatility $\\alpha_{12}$ being equal to $1$. Using the modified Raoult's law ($p_i = y_i P = x_i \\gamma_i P_i^{\\mathrm{sat}}$), the relative volatility is expressed as:\n$$ \\alpha_{12} = \\frac{y_1/x_1}{y_2/x_2} = \\frac{\\gamma_1 P_1^{\\mathrm{sat}}}{\\gamma_2 P_2^{\\mathrm{sat}}} $$\nAn azeotrope exists if there is a composition $x_1 \\in (0,1)$ where $\\alpha_{12} = 1$. A sufficient condition for this is if $\\alpha_{12}$ has values both above and below $1$ within the composition range. We check the values at the limits of composition.\n\nAt the limit $x_1 \\to 0$ (component $1$ at infinite dilution):\n$\\gamma_1 \\to \\gamma_1^\\infty$ and $\\gamma_2 \\to 1$. For the two-parameter Margules model, $\\ln \\gamma_1^\\infty = A_{12} = 1.2$.\n$$ \\alpha_{12}(x_1=0) = \\frac{\\gamma_1^\\infty P_1^{\\mathrm{sat}}}{P_2^{\\mathrm{sat}}} = \\frac{e^{1.2} P_1^{\\mathrm{sat}}}{P_2^{\\mathrm{sat}}} = \\frac{e^{1.2} \\times 30\\ \\mathrm{kPa}}{60\\ \\mathrm{kPa}} = \\frac{e^{1.2}}{2} $$\nSince $\\ln(2) \\approx 0.693$, and $1.2 > 0.693$, we have $e^{1.2} > 2$. Thus, $\\alpha_{12}(x_1=0) > 1$.\n\nAt the limit $x_1 \\to 1$ (component $2$ at infinite dilution):\n$\\gamma_1 \\to 1$ and $\\gamma_2 \\to \\gamma_2^\\infty$. For the Margules model, $\\ln \\gamma_2^\\infty = A_{21} = 1.0$.\n$$ \\alpha_{12}(x_1=1) = \\frac{P_1^{\\mathrm{sat}}}{\\gamma_2^\\infty P_2^{\\mathrm{sat}}} = \\frac{P_1^{\\mathrm{sat}}}{e^{A_{21}} P_2^{\\mathrm{sat}}} = \\frac{30\\ \\mathrm{kPa}}{e^{1.0} \\times 60\\ \\mathrm{kPa}} = \\frac{1}{2e^{1.0}} $$\nSince $e^{1.0} \\approx 2.718$, this value is clearly less than $1$.\n\nSince the continuous function $\\alpha_{12}(x_1)$ transitions from a value greater than $1$ at $x_1=0$ to a value less than $1$ at $x_1=1$, the Intermediate Value Theorem guarantees that there exists a composition $x_1^{\\mathrm{az}} \\in (0,1)$ for which $\\alpha_{12}(x_1^{\\mathrm{az}})=1$. Therefore, an azeotrope exists at $T=350\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n\nThe type of azeotrope is determined by the nature of the deviation. As established, the system exhibits positive deviations from Raoult's law ($g^{\\mathrm{E}} > 0$). Such systems, if they form an azeotrope, exhibit a maximum total pressure on a P-x diagram at constant T. A maximum pressure azeotrope corresponds to a minimum boiling point on a T-x diagram at constant P. Hence, the system exhibits a **minimum-boiling azeotrope**.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n- **A.
