It is scientifically grounded in the principles of dimensional analysis as applied to chemical kinetics, it is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. The problem is a standard exercise in applying the principle of dimensional homogeneity.\n\nThe fundamental principle to be applied is that of dimensional homogeneity, which dictates that for any physically meaningful equation, the dimensions of the terms on both sides of the equality must be identical. The given rate law is:\n$$r = k[A]^{m}[B]^{n}$$\nTo analyze the dimensions, we denote the dimensions of a physical quantity $X$ as $[X]$. Applying this to the rate law, we have:\n$$[r] = [k[A]^{m}[B]^{n}]$$\nUsing the property that the dimensions of a product are the product of the dimensions, we can separate the terms:\n$$[r] = [k] [A]^{m} [B]^{n}$$\nThe base SI dimensions relevant to this problem are amount of substance ($\\mathrm{mol}$), length ($\\mathrm{m}$), and time ($\\mathrm{s}$). For dimensional analysis, we can represent these base units with the symbols $N$ (amount of substance), $L$ (length), and $T$ (time).\n\nThe problem provides the SI units for the rate, $r$, and concentrations, $[A]$ and $[B]$.

In terms of our base dimensions, this is:\n$$[A] = [B] = N L^{-3}$$\nThe reaction orders, $m$ and $n$, are stated to be dimensionless numbers. Therefore, they do not contribute to the dimensional equation themselves, but only act as exponents on the dimensions of the concentrations.\n\nWe now substitute these dimensional expressions back into the primary dimensional equation:\n$$N^{1} L^{-3} T^{-1} = [k] (N L^{-3})^{m} (N L^{-3})^{n}$$\nThe right-hand side can be simplified by combining the concentration terms using the law of exponents:\n$$(N L^{-3})^{m} (N L^{-3})^{n} = (N L^{-3})^{m+n} = N^{m+n} (L^{-3})^{m+n} = N^{m+n} L^{-3(m+n)}$$\nThe dimensional equation now becomes:\n$$N^{1} L^{-3} T^{-1} = [k] N^{m+n} L^{-3(m+n)}$$\nTo find the dimensions of the rate constant, $k$, we must isolate $[k]$ by dividing both sides of the equation by the dimensional group for the concentration terms:\n$$[k] = \\frac{N^{1} L^{-3} T^{-1}}{N^{m+n} L^{-3(m+n)}}$$\nBy applying the rules for division of exponents ($x^{a}/x^{b} = x^{a-b}$), we can determine the net exponent for each base dimension:\nFor the dimension of amount of substance, $N$:\n$$\\text{Exponent} = 1 - (m+n) = 1 - m - n$$\nFor the dimension of length, $L$:\n$$\\text{Exponent} = -3 - (-3(m+n)) = -3 + 3m + 3n = 3(m+n-1)$$\nFor the dimension of time, $T$:\n$$\\text{Exponent} = -1$$\nCombining these results, the dimensions of the rate constant $k$ are:\n$$[k] = N^{1-m-n} L^{3(m+n-1)} T^{-1}$$\nThe problem asks for the result to be expressed as an ordered triple of exponents $(\\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma)$ corresponding to the units $\\mathrm{mol}^{\\alpha}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{\\beta}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{\\gamma}$.

The solution will now be derived from first principles as requested.\n\nThe objective is to find the standard uncertainty of the activation energy, $u(E_a)$. The estimation of parameters $(\\alpha, \\beta)$ of the linear model $y_i = \\alpha + \\beta x_i$ is based on minimizing a weighted sum of squares, which is equivalent to maximizing the Gaussian log-likelihood. The quantity to be minimized is:\n$$\nS(\\alpha, \\beta) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i(\\beta) (y_i - \\alpha - \\beta x_i)^2\n$$\nwhere the weights $w_i(\\beta) = 1/v_i(\\beta)$ are themselves functions of the parameter $\\beta$. In matrix form, we minimize $S(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) = (\\mathbf{y} - X\\boldsymbol{\\theta})^T W(\\beta) (\\mathbf{y} - X\\boldsymbol{\\theta})$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha & \\beta \\end{pmatrix}^T$.\n\nThe problem states to use the standard feasible generalized least squares (GLS) approximation. In this framework, the covariance matrix of the estimated parameter vector $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}$ is given by the inverse of the Fisher information matrix, which is approximated as $(X^T W(\\hat{\\beta}) X)^{-1}$. Here, $W(\\hat{\\beta})$ is the weight matrix evaluated at the maximum likelihood estimate of the slope, $\\hat{\\beta}$.\n\nLet $\\mathbf{C}_{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}}$ be the covariance matrix of the estimated parameters $\\hat{\\alpha}$ and $\\hat{\\beta}$.\n$$\n\\mathbf{C}_{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}} = \\operatorname{Cov}(\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}) \\approx \\left( X^T W(\\hat{\\beta}) X \\right)^{-1}\n$$\nThe design matrix $X$ and the diagonal weight matrix $W(\\hat{\\beta})$ are:\n$$\nX = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & x_1 \\\\ 1 & x_2 \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\ 1 & x_n \\end{pmatrix}, \\qquad W(\\hat{\\beta}) = \\operatorname{diag}\\left(w_1(\\hat{\\beta}), w_2(\\hat{\\beta}), \\dots, w_n(\\hat{\\beta})\\right)\n$$\nWe compute the matrix product $X^T W(\\hat{\\beta}) X$. For notational simplicity, let $w_i = w_i(\\hat{\\beta})$.\n$$\nX^T W(\\hat{\\beta}) X = \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & \\dots & 1 \\\\ x_1 & x_2 & \\dots & x_n \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} w_1 & 0 & \\dots & 0 \\\\ 0 & w_2 & \\dots & 0 \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ 0 & 0 & \\dots & w_n \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} 1 & x_1 \\\\ 1 & x_2 \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots \\\\ 1 & x_n \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nPerforming the multiplication yields a $2 \\times 2$ matrix:\n$$\nX^T W(\\hat{\\beta}) X = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i & \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i \\\\ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i & \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i^2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nUsing the definitions provided in the problem statement:\n$S_0 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i$, $S_1 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i$, and $S_2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i^2$.\nThe matrix can be written concisely as:\n$$\nX^T W(\\hat{\\beta}) X = \\begin{pmatrix} S_0 & S_1 \\\\ S_1 & S_2 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe covariance matrix $\\mathbf{C}_{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}}$ is the inverse of this matrix. The determinant of this matrix is $\\det(X^T W(\\hat{\\beta}) X) = S_0 S_2 - S_1^2$. The inverse is:\n$$\n\\mathbf{C}_{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}} = \\begin{pmatrix} S_0 & S_1 \\\\ S_1 & S_2 \\end{pmatrix}^{-1} = \\frac{1}{S_0 S_2 - S_1^2} \\begin{pmatrix} S_2 & -S_1 \\\\ -S_1 & S_0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThis matrix contains the variances and covariance of the parameter estimates:\n$$\n\\mathbf{C}_{\\hat{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}}} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\alpha}) & \\operatorname{Cov}(\\hat{\\alpha}, \\hat{\\beta}) \\\\ \\operatorname{Cov}(\\hat{\\alpha}, \\hat{\\beta}) & \\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}) \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nBy inspection, the variance of the slope estimate $\\hat{\\beta}$ is the $(2,2)$ element of this matrix:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\beta}) = \\frac{S_0}{S_0 S_2 - S_1^2}\n$$\nThe standard uncertainty of $\\hat{\\beta}$, denoted $u(\\hat{\\beta})$, is the square root of its variance:\n$$\nu(\\hat{\\beta}) = \\sqrt{\\operatorname{Var}(\\hat{\\beta})} = \\sqrt{\\frac{S_0}{S_0 S_2 - S_1^2}}\n$$\nThe activation energy $E_a$ is related to $\\beta$ through the definition $\\beta = -E_a/R$, which rearranges to $E_a = -R\\beta$. The corresponding estimate is $\\hat{E}_a = -R\\hat{\\beta}$. To find the uncertainty in $E_a$, we use first-order propagation of uncertainty. Since $R$ is a defined constant with no uncertainty:\n$$\nu(E_a)^2 \\approx \\left( \\frac{\\partial E_a}{\\partial \\beta} \\right)^2 u(\\hat{\\beta})^2\n$$\nThe partial derivative is:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial E_a}{\\partial \\beta} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta}(-R\\beta) = -R\n$$\nSubstituting this into the propagation formula:\n$$\nu(E_a)^2 = (-R)^2 u(\\hat{\\beta})^2 = R^2 u(\\hat{\\beta})^2\n$$\nTaking the square root and noting that the universal gas constant $R$ and standard uncertainties are non-negative quantities, we find:\n$$\nu(E_a) = R \\cdot u(\\hat{\\beta})\n$$\nFinally, substituting the expression for $u(\\hat{\\beta})$ gives the desired result:\n$$\nu(E_a) = R \\sqrt{\\frac{S_0}{S_0 S_2 - S_1^2}}\n$$\nThis is the closed-form analytical expression for the standard uncertainty of the activation energy, derived from the specified principles and expressed in terms of the given quantities.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{R \\sqrt{\\frac{S_0}{S_0 S_2 - S_1^2}}}\n$$", "id": "2961572"}]}
