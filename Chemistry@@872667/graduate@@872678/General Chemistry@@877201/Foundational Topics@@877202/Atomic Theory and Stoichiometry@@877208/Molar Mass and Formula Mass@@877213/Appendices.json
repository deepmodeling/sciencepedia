For any interval $[a, b]$, the value $x^{\\ast}$ that minimizes $\\max_{x \\in [a, b]} |x - x^{\\ast}|$ is the midpoint $x^{\\ast} = (a+b)/2$. The maximum deviation is then half the width of the interval, $(b-a)/2$.

The subsequent digit is $4$, which is less than $5$, so we round down.\nThe rounded value is $169.18$.\n\nFor the purposes of rigorous quantitative analysis, reporting only a single value is incomplete. The uncertainty associated with using this single value must be communicated. The uncertainty $U$ is the maximum deviation, which is half the width of the interval:\n$$U = \\frac{M_{\\max} - M_{\\min}}{2} = \\frac{169.27639 - 169.09321}{2} = \\frac{0.18318}{2} = 0.09159$$\nTherefore, in a laboratory report, the molar mass should be stated as $M = 169.1848 \\pm 0.09159 \\ \\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$.
