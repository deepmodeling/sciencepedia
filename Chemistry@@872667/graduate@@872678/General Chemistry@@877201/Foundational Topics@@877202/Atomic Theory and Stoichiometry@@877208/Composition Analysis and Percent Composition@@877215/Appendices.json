It is scientifically grounded in the principles of analytical chemistry and stoichiometry, well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and objectively stated. It requires the integration of data from multiple standard analytical techniques (Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy and Thermogravimetric Analysis) to correctly determine the chemical formula of a hydrated salt, which is a standard and non-trivial task in chemistry. We shall proceed to the solution.\n\nThe solution relies on the fundamental definitions of mass fraction, the mole, and molar mass, all governed by the Law of Definite Proportions, which states that a chemical compound always contains its component elements in fixed ratio by mass.\n\nLet $w_i$ be the mass fraction of element $i$, $m_i$ be the mass of element $i$, and $m_{total}$ be the total mass of the sample. The mass fraction is defined as $w_i = \\frac{m_i}{m_{total}}$.\nThe number of moles, $n_i$, of a substance $i$ is defined as the ratio of its mass $m_i$ to its molar mass $M_i$: $n_i = \\frac{m_i}{M_i}$.\n\nThe given atomic molar masses are:\n$M_{\\mathrm{H}} = 1.008\\,\\text{g mol}^{-1}$\n$M_{\\mathrm{O}} = 15.999\\,\\text{g mol}^{-1}$\n$M_{\\mathrm{S}} = 32.065\\,\\text{g mol}^{-1}$\n$M_{\\mathrm{Fe}} = 55.845\\,\\text{g mol}^{-1}$\n\n(i) Explanation of the incorrect formula assignment\n\nThe analyst is provided with the mass fractions of iron and sulfur in the as-received (hydrated) salt: $w_{\\mathrm{Fe}} = 0.2008$ and $w_{\\mathrm{S}} = 0.1153$. The misassignment arises from the incorrect assumption that the compound consists only of iron, sulfur, and oxygen, thereby ignoring the water of crystallization.\n\nFollowing this flawed premise, one can determine the empirical ratio of iron to sulfur. Consider an arbitrary sample mass, for example $100\\,\\mathrm{g}$.\nThe mass of iron in this sample would be $m_{\\mathrm{Fe}} = w_{\\mathrm{Fe}} \\times 100\\,\\mathrm{g} = 0.2008 \\times 100\\,\\mathrm{g} = 20.08\\,\\mathrm{g}$.\nThe mass of sulfur would be $m_{\\mathrm{S}} = w_{\\mathrm{S}} \\times 100\\,\\mathrm{g} = 0.1153 \\times 100\\,\\mathrm{g} = 11.53\\,\\mathrm{g}$.\n\nThe number of moles of each element can be calculated:\nMoles of iron: $n_{\\mathrm{Fe}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{Fe}}}{M_{\\mathrm{Fe}}} = \\frac{20.08\\,\\mathrm{g}}{55.845\\,\\text{g mol}^{-1}} \\approx 0.35956\\,\\mathrm{mol}$.\nMoles of sulfur: $n_{\\mathrm{S}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{S}}}{M_{\\mathrm{S}}} = \\frac{11.53\\,\\mathrm{g}}{32.065\\,\\text{g mol}^{-1}} \\approx 0.35958\\,\\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nTo find the simplest whole-number ratio, we divide by the smallest number of moles:\nRatio of Fe: $\\frac{n_{\\mathrm{Fe}}}{n_{\\mathrm{Fe}}} = \\frac{0.35956}{0.35956} = 1.000$.\nRatio of S: $\\frac{n_{\\mathrm{S}}}{n_{\\mathrm{Fe}}} = \\frac{0.35958}{0.35956} \\approx 1.000$.\n\nThe molar ratio of Fe to S is $1:1$. If one assumes the compound is a simple salt containing only these elements and oxygen, and knowing that sulfate ($\\text{SO}_4^{2-}$) is a common, stable oxoanion of sulfur, it is a plausible, albeit incorrect, leap to propose the formula $\\text{FeSO}_4$. This formula satisfies the $1:1$ molar ratio of Fe:S. The error lies in the initial assumption that the sum of the mass fractions of Fe, S, and O is equal to $1$. The presence of hydrogen (as water) is overlooked, but the Fe:S ratio remains valid for the hydrated compound as well.\n\n(ii) Determination of the integer $x$ in $\\text{FeSO}_4 \\cdot x\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$\n\nThe Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) data provides the necessary information to correct the formula. The mass loss observed corresponds exclusively to the loss of water of crystallization.\nInitial mass of the hydrated salt sample: $m_0 = m_{\\text{FeSO}_4 \\cdot x\\text{H}_2\\text{O}} = 1.00000\\,\\mathrm{g}$.\nFinal mass of the anhydrous salt: $m_1 = m_{\\text{FeSO}_4} = 0.54650\\,\\mathrm{g}$.\n\nThe mass of water lost during dehydration is the difference between the initial and final masses:\n$m_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}} = m_0 - m_1 = 1.00000\\,\\mathrm{g} - 0.54650\\,\\mathrm{g} = 0.45350\\,\\mathrm{g}$.\n\nTo find the value of $x$ in the formula $\\text{FeSO}_4 \\cdot x\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$, we must find the molar ratio of water to anhydrous iron(II) sulfate.\nFirst, we calculate the molar masses of the anhydrous salt ($\\text{FeSO}_4$) and water ($\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$).\n$M_{\\text{FeSO}_4} = M_{\\mathrm{Fe}} + M_{\\mathrm{S}} + 4 \\times M_{\\mathrm{O}} = 55.845 + 32.065 + 4 \\times 15.999 = 151.906\\,\\text{g mol}^{-1}$.\n$M_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}} = 2 \\times M_{\\mathrm{H}} + M_{\\mathrm{O}} = 2 \\times 1.008 + 15.999 = 18.015\\,\\text{g mol}^{-1}$.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of moles of the anhydrous salt and the water present in the initial sample.\nMoles of $\\text{FeSO}_4$: $n_{\\text{FeSO}_4} = \\frac{m_{\\text{FeSO}_4}}{M_{\\text{FeSO}_4}} = \\frac{0.54650\\,\\mathrm{g}}{151.906\\,\\text{g mol}^{-1}} \\approx 0.0035976\\,\\mathrm{mol}$.\nMoles of $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$: $n_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}} = \\frac{m_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}}{M_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}} = \\frac{0.45350\\,\\mathrm{g}}{18.015\\,\\text{g mol}^{-1}} \\approx 0.025173\\,\\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nThe coefficient $x$ is the ratio of the number of moles of water to the number of moles of anhydrous salt:\n$x = \\frac{n_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}}{n_{\\text{FeSO}_4}} = \\frac{0.025173\\,\\mathrm{mol}}{0.0035976\\,\\mathrm{mol}} \\approx 6.997$.\n\nSince $x$ must be an integer representing the number of water molecules in the crystal lattice unit formula, we round the calculated value to the nearest integer. The value is unambiguously $7$.\nThus, the correct empirical formula of the hydrated salt is $\\text{FeSO}_4 \\cdot 7\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$.\n\nWe can verify this conclusion by calculating the theoretical mass fractions of Fe and S in $\\text{FeSO}_4 \\cdot 7\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ and comparing them to the experimental values.\nThe molar mass of the hydrate is $M_{hydrate} = M_{\\text{FeSO}_4} + 7 \\times M_{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}} = 151.906 + 7 \\times 18.015 = 151.906 + 126.105 = 278.011\\,\\text{g mol}^{-1}$.\nTheoretical $w_{\\mathrm{Fe}} = \\frac{M_{\\mathrm{Fe}}}{M_{hydrate}} = \\frac{55.845}{278.011} \\approx 0.20087$.\nTheoretical $w_{\\mathrm{S}} = \\frac{M_{\\mathrm{S}}}{M_{hydrate}} = \\frac{32.065}{278.011} \\approx 0.11534$.\nThese theoretical values match the experimental values ($w_{\\mathrm{Fe}} = 0.2008$, $w_{\\mathrm{S}} = 0.1153$) almost perfectly, which confirms the correctness of our determination.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{7}\n$$", "id": "2929943"}, {"introduction": "Beyond identifying elements, composition analysis involves precisely quantifying specific compounds within complex mixtures like minerals or industrial products.

The chemical reactions, principles, and the use of uncertainty propagation are all based on fundamental, non-controversial science. The language is precise and quantitative.\n- **Well-Posed and Complete**: All necessary data, stoichiometric relationships, and assumptions required to derive the mass fraction and its uncertainty are explicitly provided. The problem is self-contained and logically consistent.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. It is a standard, solvable problem in quantitative chemical analysis and metrology. I will now provide the full solution.\n\n(a) Justification for the back-titration method:\nA direct titration of a solid, poorly soluble analyte like calcium carbonate with an acid is impractical. The justification for using a back-titration is twofold, based on chemical kinetics and measurement science.\n**Mechanistically**, the reaction between solid $\\text{CaCO}_3$ and aqueous $\\text{HCl}$ is a heterogeneous reaction. Its rate is limited by the surface area of the solid and the slow dissolution process. In a direct titration, the pH near the equivalence point would drift as the remaining solid slowly reacts, making the determination of a stable and accurate endpoint impossible. By adding a large, known excess of strong acid ($\\text{HCl}$), we ensure that the high concentration of reactant drives the reaction to completion, in accordance with Le Châtelier's principle, and at an accelerated rate. The system is given sufficient time to reach equilibrium, ensuring all the analyte has reacted.\n**From a measurement-theoretic perspective**, the procedure transforms a difficult measurement problem (detecting the endpoint of a slow, drifting heterogeneous reaction) into a simple and accurate one. The excess acid is determined by titrating it with a strong base ($\\text{NaOH}$). The reaction between a strong acid and a strong base is rapid, homogeneous, and has a very sharp, well-defined equivalence point. This results in a much smaller uncertainty in the determined endpoint volume compared to that of a direct titration of the solid, thereby improving the overall accuracy and precision of the analysis.\n\n(b) Derivation of the mass fraction, $w$:\nThe mass fraction $w$ of calcium carbonate ($\\text{CaCO}_3$) is defined as the ratio of the mass of $\\text{CaCO}_3$, denoted $m_{\\text{CaCO}_3}$, to the total mass of the sample, $m_{\\mathrm{s}}$.\n$$w = \\frac{m_{\\text{CaCO}_3}}{m_{\\mathrm{s}}}$$\nTo find $m_{\\text{CaCO}_3}$, we must first determine the amount of substance of $\\text{CaCO}_3$, denoted $n_{\\text{CaCO}_3}$, through stoichiometry.\nThe total amount of acid initially added is $n_{\\mathrm{a, total}} = C_{\\mathrm{a}} V_{\\mathrm{a}}$.\nThe amount of base used to neutralize the excess acid is $n_{\\mathrm{b}} = C_{\\mathrm{b}} V_{\\mathrm{b}}$.\nFrom the stoichiometry of the back-titration, $\\text{HCl} + \\text{NaOH} \\rightarrow \\text{NaCl} + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}$, the molar ratio is $1:1$. Thus, the amount of excess acid is equal to the amount of base used: $n_{\\mathrm{a, excess}} = n_{\\mathrm{b}} = C_{\\mathrm{b}} V_{\\mathrm{b}}$.\nThe amount of acid that reacted with the calcium carbonate, $n_{\\mathrm{a, reacted}}$, is the difference between the total acid added and the excess acid:\n$$n_{\\mathrm{a, reacted}} = n_{\\mathrm{a, total}} - n_{\\mathrm{a, excess}} = C_{\\mathrm{a}} V_{\\mathrm{a}} - C_{\\mathrm{b}} V_{\\mathrm{b}}$$\nFrom the stoichiometry of the primary reaction, $\\text{CaCO}_3 + 2\\text{HCl} \\rightarrow \\text{CaCl}_2 + \\text{CO}_2 + \\text{H}_2\\text{O}$, the amount of calcium carbonate is half the amount of hydrochloric acid it reacted with:\n$$n_{\\text{CaCO}_3} = \\frac{1}{2} n_{\\mathrm{a, reacted}} = \\frac{1}{2} (C_{\\mathrm{a}} V_{\\mathrm{a}} - C_{\\mathrm{b}} V_{\\mathrm{b}})$$\nThe mass of calcium carbonate is its amount multiplied by its molar mass, $M_{\\text{CaCO}_3}$:\n$$m_{\\text{CaCO}_3} = n_{\\text{CaCO}_3} \\times M_{\\text{CaCO}_3} = \\frac{1}{2} (C_{\\mathrm{a}} V_{\\mathrm{a}} - C_{\\mathrm{b}} V_{\\mathrm{b}}) M_{\\text{CaCO}_3}$$\nSubstituting this expression into the definition of mass fraction gives the final explicit expression for $w$:\n$$w = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} (C_{\\mathrm{a}} V_{\\mathrm{a}} - C_{\\mathrm{b}} V_{\\mathrm{b}}) M_{\\text{CaCO}_3}}{m_{\\mathrm{s}}}$$\n\n(c) Calculation of the standard uncertainty, $u(w)$:\nUnder the stated assumptions of uncorrelated input variables, the combined standard uncertainty $u(w)$ is found using the law of propagation of uncertainty. For a function $w = f(m_{\\mathrm{s}}, C_{\\mathrm{a}}, V_{\\mathrm{a}}, C_{\\mathrm{b}}, V_{\\mathrm{b}})$, the squared uncertainty is given by:\n$$u^2(w) = \\left(\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial m_{\\mathrm{s}}}\\right)^2 u^2(m_{\\mathrm{s}}) + \\left(\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial C_{\\mathrm{a}}}\\right)^2 u^2(C_{\\mathrm{a}}) + \\left(\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{a}}}\\right)^2 u^2(V_{\\mathrm{a}}) + \\left(\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial C_{\\mathrm{b}}}\\right)^2 u^2(C_{\\mathrm{b}}) + \\left(\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{b}}}\\right)^2 u^2(V_{\\mathrm{b}})$$\nWe compute the necessary partial derivatives from the expression for $w$:\n$\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial m_{\\mathrm{s}}} = -\\frac{(C_{\\mathrm{a}} V_{\\mathrm{a}} - C_{\\mathrm{b}} V_{\\mathrm{b}}) M_{\\text{CaCO}_3}}{2 m_{\\mathrm{s}}^2} = -\\frac{w}{m_{\\mathrm{s}}}$\n$\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial C_{\\mathrm{a}}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{a}} M_{\\text{CaCO}_3}}{2 m_{\\mathrm{s}}}$\n$\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{a}}} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{a}} M_{\\text{CaCO}_3}}{2 m_{\\mathrm{s}}}$\n$\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial C_{\\mathrm{b}}} = -\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{b}} M_{\\text{CaCO}_3}}{2 m_{\\mathrm{s}}}$\n$\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial V_{\\mathrm{b}}} = -\\frac{C_{\\mathrm{b}} M_{\\text{CaCO}_3}}{2 m_{\\mathrm{s}}}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerical value of $w$:\n$w = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} ((0.10000)(0.10000) - (0.10050)(0.02010)) \\times 100.0869}{0.50000}$\n$w = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} (0.010000 - 0.00202005) \\times 100.0869}{0.50000}$\n$w = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2} (0.00797995) \\times 100.0869}{0.50000} = \\frac{0.3993514...}{0.50000} \\approx 0.798703$\n\nNow, we substitute the derivatives and values into the uncertainty propagation formula:\n$u^2(w) = \\left(-\\frac{w}{m_{\\mathrm{s}}}\\right)^2 u^2(m_{\\mathrm{s}}) + \\left(\\frac{M_{\\text{CaCO}_3}}{2 m_{\\mathrm{s}}}\\right)^2 \\left[ V_{\\mathrm{a}}^2 u^2(C_{\\mathrm{a}}) + C_{\\mathrm{a}}^2 u^2(V_{\\mathrm{a}}) + V_{\\mathrm{b}}^2 u^2(C_{\\mathrm{b}}) + C_{\\mathrm{b}}^2 u^2(V_{\\mathrm{b}}) \\right]$\n\nLet us calculate each term's contribution to the variance, $u^2(w)$.\nTerm 1 ($m_{\\mathrm{s}}$):\n$\\left(-\\frac{0.798703}{0.50000}\\right)^2 (0.00005)^2 \\approx (1.5974)^2 \\times (2.5 \\times 10^{-9}) \\approx 6.379 \\times 10^{-9}$\n\nTerm 2 ($C_{\\mathrm{a}}$):\n$\\left(\\frac{0.10000 \\times 100.0869}{2 \\times 0.50000}\\right)^2 (0.00010)^2 \\approx (10.0087)^2 \\times (1 \\times 10^{-8}) \\approx 1.0017 \\times 10^{-6}$\n\nTerm 3 ($V_{\\mathrm{a}}$):\n$\\left(\\frac{0.10000 \\times 100.0869}{2 \\times 0.50000}\\right)^2 (0.00005)^2 \\approx (10.0087)^2 \\times (2.5 \\times 10^{-9}) \\approx 2.504 \\times 10^{-7}$\n\nTerm 4 ($C_{\\mathrm{b}}$):\n$\\left(-\\frac{0.02010 \\times 100.0869}{2 \\times 0.50000}\\right)^2 (0.00010)^2 \\approx (-2.0117)^2 \\times (1 \\times 10^{-8}) \\approx 4.047 \\times 10^{-8}$\n\nTerm 5 ($V_{\\mathrm{b}}$):\n$\\left(-\\frac{0.10050 \\times 100.0869}{2 \\times 0.50000}\\right)^2 (0.00005)^2 \\approx (-10.0587)^2 \\times (2.5 \\times 10^{-9}) \\approx 2.529 \\times 10^{-7}$\n\nSumming these contributions to the variance:\n$u^2(w) \\approx (6.379 \\times 10^{-9}) + (1.0017 \\times 10^{-6}) + (2.504 \\times 10^{-7}) + (4.047 \\times 10^{-8}) + (2.529 \\times 10^{-7})$\n$u^2(w) \\approx (0.006379 + 1.0017 + 0.2504 + 0.04047 + 0.2529) \\times 10^{-6}$\n$u^2(w) \\approx 1.5518 \\times 10^{-6}$\n\nFinally, the standard uncertainty $u(w)$ is the square root of the variance:\n$u(w) = \\sqrt{1.5518 \\times 10^{-6}} \\approx 0.0012457$\n\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested:\n$u(w) \\approx 0.001246$\nThis is the standard uncertainty of the mass fraction.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.001246}\n$$", "id": "2930008"}, {"introduction": "The ultimate goal of composition analysis for a pure substance is often the unambiguous determination of its molecular formula.

Report the result as a row matrix containing the stoichiometric coefficients in the order $\\mathrm{C}$, $\\mathrm{H}$, $\\mathrm{N}$. Express your final answer as exact integers without units. If any intermediate numerical approximations are needed, carry sufficient precision to avoid rounding errors that could change the inferred integers.", "solution": "The problem statement has been critically evaluated and is deemed valid. It is scientifically grounded, self-contained, and quantitatively well-posed, providing multiple, independent, and consistent experimental constraints to determine a unique molecular formula. All provided data and principles are standard in the field of analytical chemistry. Therefore, a rigorous solution can be derived.\n\nThe problem requires the determination of the integer stoichiometric coefficients $n_{\\mathrm{C}}$, $n_{\\mathrm{H}}$, and $n_{\\mathrm{N}}$ for an unknown compound with the general formula $\\text{C}_{n_{\\mathrm{C}}}\\text{H}_{n_{\\mathrm{H}}}\\text{N}_{n_{\\mathrm{N}}}$. The solution will proceed by systematically applying the provided constraints, starting with the most precise data from high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) to identify candidate formulae, followed by validation against elemental analysis and isotopic pattern data.\n\nFirst, we analyze the HRMS data. A molecular ion is observed at $m/z = 162.115698$. For a neutral molecule undergoing electron ionization, this value corresponds to the monoisotopic mass of the molecule, which is calculated using the masses of the most abundant isotopes: $^{12}\\text{C}$, $^{1}\\text{H}$, and $^{14}\\text{N}$. The theoretical monoisotopic mass, $M_{calc}$, is given by:\n$$ M_{calc} = n_{\\mathrm{C}} \\cdot m(^{12}\\text{C}) + n_{\\mathrm{H}} \\cdot m(^{1}\\text{H}) + n_{\\mathrm{N}} \\cdot m(^{14}\\text{N}) $$\nUsing the provided monoisotopic masses:\n$$ M_{calc} = n_{\\mathrm{C}} \\cdot (12.000000000) + n_{\\mathrm{H}} \\cdot (1.007825032) + n_{\\mathrm{N}} \\cdot (14.003074004) $$\nThe experimental mass is $m_{exp} = 162.115698$ with an accuracy of $\\pm 2$ parts per million (ppm). The permissible mass error, $\\Delta m$, is:\n$$ \\Delta m = m_{exp} \\times (\\pm 2 \\times 10^{-6}) = 162.115698 \\times (\\pm 2 \\times 10^{-6}) \\approx \\pm 0.00032423 $$\nThus, the true monoisotopic mass must lie within the range:\n$$ 162.115698 - 0.00032423 \\le M_{calc} \\le 162.115698 + 0.00032423 $$\n$$ 162.115374 \\le M_{calc} \\le 162.116022 $$\nThe nominal mass of the molecule is $\\lfloor m_{exp} \\rfloor = 162$. According to the nitrogen rule, a molecule with an even nominal mass must contain an even number of nitrogen atoms (or zero). Since the compound is known to contain nitrogen, $n_{\\mathrm{N}}$ must be a positive even integer: $n_{\\mathrm{N}} \\in \\{2, 4, 6, \\dots\\}$. The maximum number of nitrogen atoms is limited by mass: $n_{\\mathrm{N, max}} = \\lfloor 162 / 14 \\rfloor = 11$, so possible values for $n_{\\mathrm{N}}$ are $2, 4, 6, 8, 10$.\n\nTo find integer solutions ($n_{\\mathrm{C}}, n_{\\mathrm{H}}, n_{\\mathrm{N}}$), we can analyze the mass defect. The mass defect, $\\delta$, is the difference between the exact mass and the nominal mass ($M_{nom} = 12 n_{\\mathrm{C}} + n_{\\mathrm{H}} + 14 n_{\\mathrm{N}}$). However, a more direct approach utilizes the fractional masses of the isotopes.\n$$ M_{calc} - 12 n_{\\mathrm{C}} - n_{\\mathrm{H}} - 14 n_{\\mathrm{N}} = n_{\\mathrm{H}} \\cdot (m(^{1}\\text{H}) - 1) + n_{\\mathrm{N}} \\cdot (m(^{14}\\text{N}) - 14) $$\n$$ M_{calc} - M_{nom} = n_{\\mathrm{H}} \\cdot (0.007825032) + n_{\\mathrm{N}} \\cdot (0.003074004) $$\nThe experimental mass defect is $m_{exp} - \\lfloor m_{exp} \\rfloor = 0.115698$. The allowed range for the calculated mass defect is therefore:\n$$ 162.115374 - 162 \\le \\delta_{calc} \\le 162.116022 - 162 $$\n$$ 0.115374 \\le 0.007825032 \\cdot n_{\\mathrm{H}} + 0.003074004 \\cdot n_{\\mathrm{N}} \\le 0.116022 $$\nWe can now test the allowed even integer values for $n_{\\mathrm{N}}$.\nFor $n_{\\mathrm{N}} = 2$:\n$$ 0.115374 \\le 0.007825032 \\cdot n_{\\mathrm{H}} + 2 \\cdot (0.003074004) \\le 0.116022 $$\n$$ 0.115374 \\le 0.007825032 \\cdot n_{\\mathrm{H}} + 0.006148008 \\le 0.116022 $$\n$$ 0.109226 \\le 0.007825032 \\cdot n_{\\mathrm{H}} \\le 0.109874 $$\n$$ \\frac{0.109226}{0.007825032} \\le n_{\\mathrm{H}} \\le \\frac{0.109874}{0.007825032} $$\n$$ 13.9585 \\le n_{\\mathrm{H}} \\le 14.0413 $$\nThe only integer value for $n_{\\mathrm{H}}$ in this range is $14$. With $n_{\\mathrm{N}} = 2$ and $n_{\\mathrm{H}} = 14$, we can find $n_{\\mathrm{C}}$ from the total mass. The mass contribution from H and N is $14 \\cdot (1.007825032) + 2 \\cdot (14.003074004) = 14.109550448 + 28.006148008 = 42.115698456$. The remaining mass must be from carbon: $m_{\\mathrm{C}} = M_{calc} - 42.115698456$. Using the center of the mass range, $162.115698$, we get $m_{\\mathrm{C}} = 120.000000$. Since $m(^{12}\\text{C}) = 12.000000000$, this gives $n_{\\mathrm{C}} = 10$.\nThis yields a single candidate formula: $\\text{C}_{10}\\text{H}_{14}\\text{N}_{2}$. Let us check other values of $n_{\\mathrm{N}}$.\nFor $n_{\\mathrm{N}} = 4$:\n$$ 0.115374 \\le 0.007825032 \\cdot n_{\\mathrm{H}} + 4 \\cdot (0.003074004) \\le 0.116022 $$\n$$ 0.103078 \\le 0.007825032 \\cdot n_{\\mathrm{H}} \\le 0.103726 $$\n$$ 13.1728 \\le n_{\\mathrm{H}} \\le 13.2556 $$\nThis range contains no integer for $n_{\\mathrm{H}}$. Further increase of $n_{\\mathrm{N}}$ will continue to decrease the range for $n_{\\mathrm{H}}$, yielding no other integer solutions. Thus, HRMS and the nitrogen rule uniquely suggest the formula $\\text{C}_{10}\\text{H}_{14}\\text{N}_{2}$. We verify its calculated mass:\n$M_{calc} = 10(12.000000000) + 14(1.007825032) + 2(14.003074004) = 162.115698456$.\nThe mass error is $\\frac{162.115698456 - 162.115698}{162.115698} \\times 10^6 \\approx +0.0028$ ppm, which is well within the $\\pm 2$ ppm tolerance.\n\nSecond, we validate this formula against the elemental analysis data. We calculate the theoretical mass fractions using the average atomic weights ($M_{\\mathrm{C}} = 12.011 \\text{ g mol}^{-1}, M_{\\mathrm{H}} = 1.008 \\text{ g mol}^{-1}, M_{\\mathrm{N}} = 14.007 \\text{ g mol}^{-1}$). The molar mass $M$ of $\\text{C}_{10}\\text{H}_{14}\\text{N}_{2}$ is:\n$$ M = 10 \\cdot (12.011) + 14 \\cdot (1.008) + 2 \\cdot (14.007) = 120.11 + 14.112 + 28.014 = 162.236 \\text{ g/mol} $$\nThe theoretical mass fractions ($w$) are:\n$$ w_{\\mathrm{C}} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 12.011}{162.236} \\approx 0.74036 $$\n$$ w_{\\mathrm{H}} = \\frac{14 \\cdot 1.008}{162.236} \\approx 0.08698 $$\n$$ w_{\\mathrm{N}} = \\frac{2 \\cdot 14.007}{162.236} \\approx 0.17268 $$\nComparing these to the experimental ranges:\n- Carbon: $w_{\\mathrm{C,exp}} = 0.74020 \\pm 0.00100$, range $[0.73920, 0.74120]$. Calculated $0.74036$ is within this range.\n- Hydrogen: $w_{\\mathrm{H,exp}} = 0.087040 \\pm 0.000500$, range $[0.086540, 0.087540]$. Calculated $0.08698$ is within this range.\n- Nitrogen: $w_{\\mathrm{N,exp}} = 0.172760 \\pm 0.000800$, range $[0.171960, 0.173560]$. Calculated $0.17268$ is within this range.\nThe formula is consistent with the elemental analysis data.\n\nThird, we validate against the isotopic pattern. The relative intensity of the $M+1$ peak, to a first approximation, is given by:\n$$ \\frac{I(M+1)}{I(M)} \\approx n_{\\mathrm{C}} p(^{13}\\text{C}) + n_{\\mathrm{H}} p(^{2}\\text{H}) + n_{\\mathrm{N}} p(^{15}\\text{N}) $$\nUsing the given abundances $p_{\\mathrm{C}} = 0.01070$, $p_{\\mathrm{H}} = 0.000156$, $p_{\\mathrm{N}} = 0.00364$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{I(M+1)}{I(M)}\\right)_{calc} = 10(0.01070) + 14(0.000156) + 2(0.00364) = 0.10700 + 0.002184 + 0.00728 = 0.116464 $$\nThe experimental ratio is $0.1165 \\pm 0.0010$, range $[0.1155, 0.1175]$. The calculated value $0.116464$ is well within this range.\n\nThe relative intensity of the $M+2$ peak is the sum of probabilities of isotope combinations leading to a mass increase of two. The major contributions are from two $^{13}\\text{C}$ atoms and from one $^{13}\\text{C}$ and one $^{15}\\text{N}$.\n$$ \\frac{I(M+2)}{I(M)} \\approx \\binom{n_{\\mathrm{C}}}{2} p_{\\mathrm{C}}^2 + n_{\\mathrm{C}}n_{\\mathrm{H}}p_{\\mathrm{C}}p_{\\mathrm{H}} + n_{\\mathrm{C}}n_{\\mathrm{N}}p_{\\mathrm{C}}p_{\\mathrm{N}} + \\dots $$\nCalculating the significant terms for $\\text{C}_{10}\\text{H}_{14}\\text{N}_{2}$ :\n- Two $^{13}\\text{C}$: $\\binom{10}{2} (0.01070)^2 = 45 \\cdot (0.00011449) = 0.00515205$\n- One $^{13}\\text{C}$, one $^{15}\\text{N}$: $10 \\cdot 2 \\cdot (0.01070)(0.00364) = 0.00077896$\n- One $^{13}\\text{C}$, one $^{2}\\text{H}$: $10 \\cdot 14 \\cdot (0.01070)(0.000156) = 0.00023369$\nThe sum of these contributions is $0.00515205 + 0.00077896 + 0.00023369 \\approx 0.006165$. Other terms are smaller.\nThe experimental ratio is $0.0062 \\pm 0.0005$, range $[0.0057, 0.0067]$. The calculated value $0.006165$ is well within this range.\n\nAll independent experimental data sets consistently and uniquely support the molecular formula $\\text{C}_{10}\\text{H}_{14}\\text{N}_{2}$. The stoichiometric coefficients are therefore $n_{\\mathrm{C}}=10$, $n_{\\mathrm{H}}=14$, and $n_{\\mathrm{N}}=2$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n10 & 14 & 2\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2929973"}]}
