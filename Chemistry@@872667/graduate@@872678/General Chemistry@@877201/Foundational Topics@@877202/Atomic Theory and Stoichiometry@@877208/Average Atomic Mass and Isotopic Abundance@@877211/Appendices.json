When the isotope masses $m_{i}$ are expressed on the unified atomic mass scale (that is, in atomic mass units, which already incorporate the ${}^{12}\\mathrm{C}$ reference), $A_{r}(E)$ equals the mixture-averaged atomic mass in the same units.\n\nPart $1$. Let the sample contain $N_{\\mathrm{tot}}$ atoms of $E$, with fractions $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ belonging to isotopes of masses $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$, respectively.

Hence, from a single scalar average $A_{r}(E)$ and normalization alone, $(x_{1},\\dots,x_{N})$ is not uniquely identifiable unless $N = 2$.\n\nTo restore identifiability in principle for $N \\geq 3$, one must supply $N - 2$ additional independent scalar measurements that provide linearly independent constraints on $x$. For example, if one can measure mixture-averaged values of $N - 2$ additional isotope-weighted properties yielding linear forms $p^{(k)\\top} x = P_{k}$, $k = 1,\\dots,N-2$, with the vectors $u$, $m$, and $p^{(1)},\\dots,p^{(N-2)}$ linearly independent, then the full $N \\times N$ system is generically invertible and the abundances are uniquely determined (subject to physical feasibility $x_{i} \\geq 0$). A canonical parametrization of the underdetermined case is obtained by selecting $N - 2$ indices as free parameters $t_{j} = x_{j}$ and solving the two linear equations for the remaining two $x_{i}$ in terms of the $t_{j}$, with feasibility further restricting the allowable range of the $t_{j}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}\\dfrac{m_{2}-A_{r}(E)}{m_{2}-m_{1}}  \\dfrac{A_{r}(E)-m_{1}}{m_{2}-m_{1}}\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2920375"}, {"introduction": "While the calculation of average atomic mass is a straightforward weighted average, its behavior can sometimes be counter-intuitive.
