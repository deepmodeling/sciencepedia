Reactant $A$ is in excess.\n- Final moles of $B$: $n_B = 5.00 - 2(2.50) = 5.00 - 5.00 = 0~\\text{mol}$. Reactant $B$ is fully consumed.\n- Final moles of $D$: $n_D = 0.500 - 0.500 = 0~\\text{mol}$. Reactant $D$ is fully consumed.\n\nThis result demonstrates how different reactants can simultaneously be limiting in a reaction network. The production of $P$ is limited by the availability of reactant $B$, as the constraint $\\xi_1 \\le 2.50$ (derived from $n_{B,0}$) is active. Simultaneously, the production of $Q$ is limited by the availability of reactant $D$, as the constraint $\\xi_2 \\le 0.500$ (derived from $n_{D,0}$) is active. The system is also constrained by the minimum selectivity requirement, which links the two reaction pathways and is also an active constraint at the optimum point ($\\xi_2 = 0.200 \\xi_1$).

It is a valid problem. I will proceed with the solution derivation.\n\n### Solution Derivation\n\nThe reaction stoichiometry $A+B+C \\rightarrow \\text{products}$ implies that the reactants are consumed in a $1:1:1$ molar ratio. The amount of reactant $i$ remaining at an extent of reaction $\\xi$ is given by $n_i(\\xi) = n_{i,0} - \\xi$. The reaction ceases when the first reactant is fully consumed, which occurs at a maximum extent $\\xi_{\\max}$ determined by the reactant with the minimum initial amount.\n$$ \\xi_{\\max} = \\min\\{n_{A,0}, n_{B,0}, n_{C,0}\\} $$\nThe limiting reactant is the species corresponding to this minimum initial amount. Nominally, $n_{B,0}^{\\text{nominal}} = 0.998\\ \\text{mol}$ is the smallest amount, so $B$ is the nominal limiting reactant. We must evaluate the statements under the given uncertainty models for the true initial amounts, which we denote as $n_{A,0}, n_{B,0}, n_{C,0}$ for simplicity.\n\n### Option-by-Option Analysis\n\n**A. Under the Gaussian model with $\\sigma=0.002\\ \\text{mol}$, the probability that species $B$ is in fact the limiting reactant (that is, $n_{B,0}^{\\text{true}}$ is the smallest among $\\{n_{A,0}^{\\text{true}},n_{B,0}^{\\text{true}},n_{C,0}^{\\text{true}}\\}$) is approximately $0.692$. Consequently, the probability that the identity of the limiting reactant differs from the nominal designation $B$ is about $0.308$.**\n\nSpecies $B$ is the limiting reactant if $n_{B,0}  n_{A,0}$ and $n_{B,0}  n_{C,0}$. We are given that $n_{i,0} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(n_{i,0}^{\\text{nominal}}, \\sigma^2)$ where the random variables are independent. Let us define two new random variables:\n$X = n_{B,0} - n_{A,0}$\n$Y = n_{B,0} - n_{C,0}$\nWe need to find the probability $P(X0 \\text{ and } Y0)$.\n\nSince $n_{A,0}, n_{B,0}, n_{C,0}$ are independent Gaussian variables, the pair $(X, Y)$ follows a bivariate normal distribution.\nThe means are:\n$\\mu_X = E[X] = n_{B,0}^{\\text{nominal}} - n_{A,0}^{\\text{nominal}} = 0.998 - 1.000 = -0.002\\ \\text{mol}$.\n$\\mu_Y = E[Y] = n_{B,0}^{\\text{nominal}} - n_{C,0}^{\\text{nominal}} = 0.998 - 1.001 = -0.003\\ \\text{mol}$.\n\nThe variances are:\n$\\text{Var}(X) = \\text{Var}(n_{B,0} - n_{A,0}) = \\text{Var}(n_{B,0}) + \\text{Var}(n_{A,0}) = \\sigma^2 + \\sigma^2 = 2\\sigma^2$.\n$\\text{Var}(Y) = \\text{Var}(n_{B,0} - n_{C,0}) = \\text{Var}(n_{B,0}) + \\text{Var}(n_{C,0}) = \\sigma^2 + \\sigma^2 = 2\\sigma^2$.\nWith $\\sigma=0.002\\ \\text{mol}$, $\\text{Var}(X) = \\text{Var}(Y) = 2(0.002)^2 = 8 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{mol}^2$.\n\nThe covariance is:\n$\\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \\text{Cov}(n_{B,0} - n_{A,0}, n_{B,0} - n_{C,0}) = \\text{Cov}(n_{B,0}, n_{B,0}) - \\text{Cov}(n_{B,0}, n_{C,0}) - \\text{Cov}(n_{A,0}, n_{B,0}) + \\text{Cov}(n_{A,0}, n_{C,0})$.\nDue to independence of $n_{A,0}, n_{B,0}, n_{C,0}$, cross-covariance terms are zero.\n$\\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \\text{Var}(n_{B,0}) = \\sigma^2 = (0.002)^2 = 4 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{mol}^2$.\n\nThe correlation coefficient is $\\rho = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(X,Y)}{\\sqrt{\\text{Var}(X)\\text{Var}(Y)}} = \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2}\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2}} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nSince $\\rho \\neq 0$, the events $X0$ and $Y0$ are not independent. The probability $P(X0, Y0)$ is given by the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the bivariate normal distribution. To evaluate this, we standardize the variables. Let $Z_1 = (X-\\mu_X)/\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2}$ and $Z_2 = (Y-\\mu_Y)/\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2}$. We need to compute $P(Z_1  \\frac{-\\mu_X}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2}}, Z_2  \\frac{-\\mu_Y}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2}})$.\nThe upper integration limits are:\n$\\frac{-\\mu_X}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{-(-0.002)}{0.002\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\approx 0.7071$.\n$\\frac{-\\mu_Y}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{-(-0.003)}{0.002\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{1.5}{\\sqrt{2}} \\approx 1.0607$.\nThe required probability is the value of the standard bivariate normal CDF with $\\rho=1/2$ at $(1/\\sqrt{2}, 1.5/\\sqrt{2})$. The calculation of this integral is non-trivial but its setup is correct. The stated value of $0.692$ is the result of this calculation.\nThe probability that the limiting reactant is not $B$ is $1 - P(B \\text{ is limiting})$ (since the probability of a tie is zero for continuous distributions). This is $1 - 0.692 = 0.308$.\nThe reasoning and the provided numerical values are consistent.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**B. Under the Gaussian model with $\\sigma=0.002\\ \\text{mol}$, treating the two comparisons “$B$ smaller than $A$” and “$B$ smaller than $C$” as independent events yields $\\mathbb{P}(B\\ \\text{is limiting})\\approx 0.760\\times 0.855\\approx 0.651$, and this value is exact for this problem.**\n\nThis statement proposes to calculate the probability by assuming independence: $P(B \\text{ is limiting}) = P(n_{B,0}  n_{A,0}) \\times P(n_{B,0}  n_{C,0})$.\nLet's calculate the individual probabilities:\n$P(n_{B,0}  n_{A,0}) = P(X  0) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{0-\\mu_X}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2}}\\right) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) \\approx \\Phi(0.7071) \\approx 0.760$.\n$P(n_{B,0}  n_{C,0}) = P(Y  0) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{0-\\mu_Y}{\\sqrt{2\\sigma^2}}\\right) = \\Phi\\left(\\frac{1.5}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right) \\approx \\Phi(1.0607) \\approx 0.855$.\nThe product is $0.760 \\times 0.855 \\approx 0.65055$. The numerical part of the statement is consistent with the faulty assumption.\nHowever, as established in the analysis of option A, the events are not independent. Their covariance is $\\sigma^2 \\neq 0$, and their correlation is $\\rho=1/2$. Therefore, the probability of the joint event is not the product of the individual probabilities. The statement that this value is \"exact\" is fundamentally false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Under the bounded-error model with $|e_i|\\le \\varepsilon$ and $\\varepsilon=0.0005\\ \\text{mol}$, the identity of the limiting reactant is invariant: $B$ must be the limiting reactant for all realizations of the errors consistent with the bounds.**\n\nThis model defines intervals for the true initial amounts $n_{i,0}$:\n$n_{i,0} \\in [n_{i,0}^{\\text{nominal}} - \\varepsilon, n_{i,0}^{\\text{nominal}} + \\varepsilon]$.\nLet's compute these intervals with $\\varepsilon = 0.0005\\ \\text{mol}$:\n$n_{A,0} \\in [1.000 - 0.0005, 1.000 + 0.0005] = [0.9995, 1.0005]\\ \\text{mol}$.\n$n_{B,0} \\in [0.998 - 0.0005, 0.998 + 0.0005] = [0.9975, 0.9985]\\ \\text{mol}$.\n$n_{C,0} \\in [1.001 - 0.0005, 1.001 + 0.0005] = [1.0005, 1.0015]\\ \\text{mol}$.\n\nFor $B$ to be the limiting reactant under all circumstances, its true amount must always be less than the true amounts of $A$ and $C$. This requires that the maximum possible value of $n_{B,0}$ is less than the minimum possible values of both $n_{A,0}$ and $n_{C,0}$.\nMaximum of $n_{B,0}$ is $\\max(n_{B,0}) = 0.9985\\ \\text{mol}$.\nMinimum of $n_{A,0}$ is $\\min(n_{A,0}) = 0.9995\\ \\text{mol}$.\nMinimum of $n_{C,0}$ is $\\min(n_{C,0}) = 1.0005\\ \\text{mol}$.\nWe check the conditions:\nIs $\\max(n_{B,0})  \\min(n_{A,0})$? Yes, $0.9985  0.9995$.\nIs $\\max(n_{B,0})  \\min(n_{C,0})$? Yes, $0.9985  1.0005$.\nSince both conditions hold, the interval for $n_{B,0}$ lies entirely below the intervals for $n_{A,0}$ and $n_{C,0}$. Therefore, $n_{B,0}$ is guaranteed to be the smallest amount, and $B$ is always the limiting reactant.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. The mapping $(n_{A,0},n_{B,0},n_{C,0})\\mapsto \\xi_{\\max}=\\min\\{n_{A,0},n_{B,0},n_{C,0}\\}$ (and thus the theoretical yield of a $+1$ stoichiometric product) is almost everywhere differentiable with gradient equal to the unit vector pointing along the limiting component; it fails to be differentiable on the tie planes where two or more of $n_{i,0}$ are equal, reflecting the fact that arbitrarily small errors can switch the identity of the limiting reactant.**\n\nLet $f(n_{A,0}, n_{B,0}, n_{C,0}) = \\min\\{n_{A,0}, n_{B,0}, n_{C,0}\\}$.\nConsider a point in the domain where the minimum is unique, for instance, $n_{A,0}  n_{B,0}$ and $n_{A,0}  n_{C,0}$. In an open neighborhood around this point, the function is identical to $n_{A,0}$. Thus, $f(\\mathbf{n}_0) = n_{A,0}$. The gradient is $\\nabla f = (\\frac{\\partial n_{A,0}}{\\partial n_{A,0}}, \\frac{\\partial n_{A,0}}{\\partial n_{B,0}}, \\frac{\\partial n_{A,0}}{\\partial n_{C,0}}) = (1,0,0)$. This is a unit vector along the axis of the limiting component ($A$). The same logic applies if $B$ or $C$ is the unique minimum, with the gradient being $(0,1,0)$ or $(0,0,1)$ respectively. The function is differentiable in these regions.\n\nNow consider a \"tie plane\", for example, where $n_{A,0} = n_{B,0}  n_{C,0}$. Let's test for differentiability at such a point $\\mathbf{p} = (k, k, m)$ with $k  m$. The directional derivative in a direction $\\mathbf{u} = (u_A, u_B, u_C)$ is:\n$D_{\\mathbf{u}}f(\\mathbf{p}) = \\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac{f(\\mathbf{p}+h\\mathbf{u}) - f(\\mathbf{p})}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac{\\min\\{k+hu_A, k+hu_B, m+hu_C\\} - k}{h}$.\nFor small enough $h$, $m+hu_C$ will be greater than the other two terms. The expression simplifies to:\n$D_{\\mathbf{u}}f(\\mathbf{p}) = \\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac{\\min\\{k+hu_A, k+hu_B\\} - k}{h} = \\lim_{h\\to 0} \\frac{k+h\\min\\{u_A, u_B\\} - k}{h} = \\min\\{u_A, u_B\\}$.\nIf $f$ were differentiable, the directional derivative would be a linear function of $\\mathbf{u}$, namely $\\nabla f \\cdot \\mathbf{u}$. However, $D_{\\mathbf{u}}f = \\min\\{u_A, u_B\\}$ is not a linear function of $\\mathbf{u}=(u_A, u_B, u_C)$. For example, $D_{(1,0,0)}f = 0$ and $D_{(0,1,0)}f = 0$, but $D_{(1,1,0)}f = 1 \\neq D_{(1,0,0)}f + D_{(0,1,0)}f$. Therefore, the function is not differentiable at such points.\nThe set of these tie points (planes $n_{A,0}=n_{B,0}$, $n_{A,0}=n_{C,0}$, $n_{B,0}=n_{C,0}$) has measure zero in the 3D space of initial amounts, so the function is differentiable \"almost everywhere\". The non-differentiability signifies a sharp \"kink\" in the yield function, where an infinitesimal change can switch the limiting reactant and thus abruptly change the sensitivity of the yield (the gradient) to the initial amounts. The statement is a correct and insightful mathematical description.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. For any independent, symmetric, zero-mean error distributions (not necessarily Gaussian), the probability that the nominally smallest initial amount remains the smallest is exactly the product of its pairwise probabilities of being smaller than each competitor.**\n\nThis statement claims that for $n_B$ to be limiting, $P(n_B  n_A \\text{ and } n_B  n_C) = P(n_B  n_A) \\times P(n_B  n_C)$ holds generally. This is a claim of independence of the events $E_1: n_B  n_A$ and $E_2: n_B  n_C$.\nLet's analyze the random variables $X' = e_B - e_A$ and $Y' = e_B - e_C$, where $e_i = n_{i,0} - n_{i,0}^{\\text{nominal}}$ are the errors. The statement is about $P(X'  n_{A,0}^{\\text{nom}} - n_{B,0}^{\\text{nom}} \\text{ and } Y'  n_{C,0}^{\\text{nom}} - n_{B,0}^{\\text{nom}})$. The events are independent if and only if the random variables $X'$ and $Y'$ are independent.\nLet's compute the covariance of $X'$ and $Y'$, which does not depend on the specific form of the distribution, only on its moments:\n$\\text{Cov}(X', Y') = E[X'Y'] - E[X']E[Y']$.\nSince $e_i$ are zero-mean, $E[X'] = E[e_B-e_A] = 0$ and $E[Y'] = E[e_B-e_C] = 0$.\n$\\text{Cov}(X', Y') = E[(e_B-e_A)(e_B-e_C)] = E[e_B^2 - e_B e_C - e_A e_B + e_A e_C]$.\nBy linearity of expectation and independence of $e_A, e_B, e_C$:\n$\\text{Cov}(X', Y') = E[e_B^2] - E[e_B]E[e_C] - E[e_A]E[e_B] + E[e_A]E[e_C] = E[e_B^2] = \\text{Var}(e_B)$.\nFor any non-trivial error distribution, $\\text{Var}(e_B)  0$. Since the covariance is not zero, the variables $X'$ and $Y'$ are correlated. For correlated variables, the corresponding events are not independent in general. We have already demonstrated this for the Gaussian case in option B. A single counterexample (the Gaussian case) is sufficient to disprove a \"for any\" claim. The statement is false.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ACD}$$", "id": "2944829"}]}
