In differential form, this is $dU = dQ_{\\text{rev}} + dW_{\\text{rev}}$. For a reversible process, we have $dQ_{\\text{rev}} = T dS$ and $dW_{\\text{rev}} = -P dV$. This leads to the fundamental equation for internal energy:\n$$ dU = T dS - P dV $$\nInternal energy, $U$, is a state function. We can therefore express its total differential in terms of any two independent state variables. For this problem, the variables of temperature, $T$, and volume, $V$, are most convenient. The total differential of $U(T, V)$ is:\n$$ dU = \\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial T}\\right)_V dT + \\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial V}\\right)_T dV $$\nThe process under consideration is isothermal, which means the temperature $T$ is constant, and therefore its differential $dT$ is zero. The expression for the change in internal energy simplifies to:\n$$ dU_T = \\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial V}\\right)_T dV $$\nThe partial derivative $\\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial V}\\right)_T$ is known as the internal pressure, which quantifies how the internal energy of a substance changes with volume at constant temperature. To find an expression for this term, we return to the fundamental equation $dU = T dS - P dV$. Dividing by $dV$ while holding $T$ constant gives:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial V}\\right)_T = T \\left(\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial V}\\right)_T - P $$\nThis expression contains a partial derivative of entropy, which is not convenient. We can replace it using a Maxwell relation. The Maxwell relations arise from the fact that the fundamental thermodynamic potentials are state functions, meaning their mixed second partial derivatives are equal. The relevant relation comes from the Helmholtz free energy, $A = U - TS$. Its differential is $dA = dU - T dS - S dT = (T dS - P dV) - T dS - S dT = -S dT - P dV$. From $A(T, V)$, the equality of mixed partial derivatives $\\frac{\\partial^2 A}{\\partial V \\partial T} = \\frac{\\partial^2 A}{\\partial T \\partial V}$ implies:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\partial (-S)}{\\partial V}\\right)_T = \\left(\\frac{\\partial (-P)}{\\partial T}\\right)_V \\implies \\left(\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial V}\\right)_T = \\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial T}\\right)_V $$\nSubstituting this Maxwell relation into the equation for the internal pressure yields a critical thermodynamic equation of state:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial V}\\right)_T = T \\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial T}\\right)_V - P $$\nThis equation is general and applies to any fluid. Now we apply it to the specific case of a van der Waals gas. The van der Waals equation of state is given by:\n$$ \\left(P + \\frac{an^2}{V^2}\\right)(V - nb) = nRT $$\nTo use our thermodynamic equation of state, we must first find $\\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial T}\\right)_V$. We rearrange the van der Waals equation to express pressure $P$ as a function of $T$ and $V$:\n$$ P(T,V) = \\frac{nRT}{V - nb} - \\frac{an^2}{V^2} $$\nNow we take the partial derivative of $P$ with respect to $T$ at constant $V$ and $n$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial T}\\right)_V = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial T} \\left( \\frac{nRT}{V - nb} - \\frac{an^2}{V^2} \\right) = \\frac{nR}{V - nb} $$\nThe term $\\frac{an^2}{V^2}$, which accounts for the attractive forces between molecules, is independent of temperature, so its derivative with respect to $T$ is zero.\nNext, substitute this result for $\\left(\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial T}\\right)_V$ into the expression for the internal pressure:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial V}\\right)_T = T \\left( \\frac{nR}{V - nb} \\right) - P $$\nNow, we substitute the full expression for the van der Waals pressure $P$ back into this equation:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial V}\\right)_T = \\frac{nRT}{V - nb} - \\left( \\frac{nRT}{V - nb} - \\frac{an^2}{V^2} \\right) $$\nThe terms involving the kinetic energy component of the pressure cancel, leaving a remarkably simple result:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial V}\\right)_T = \\frac{an^2}{V^2} $$\nThis result explicitly reveals the feature of non-ideality responsible for the volume dependence of internal energy. The internal pressure of a van der Waals gas is non-zero solely due to the parameter $a$, which represents the strength of intermolecular attractive forces. For an ideal gas, $a=0$, and thus $\\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial V}\\right)_T = 0$, meaning its internal energy depends only on temperature. For the van der Waals gas, expanding the volume requires work to pull the molecules apart against these attractions, which increases their potential energy and thus the total internal energy of the system. The parameter $b$, representing excluded volume, does not contribute to the internal pressure.\n\nTo find the total change in internal energy, $\\Delta U$, for the specified isothermal expansion from an initial volume $V_1$ to a final volume $V_2$, we must integrate $dU_T$ over the path:\n$$ \\Delta U = \\int_{U(T,V_1)}^{U(T,V_2)} dU = \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} \\left(\\frac{\\partial U}{\\partial V}\\right)_T dV $$\nSubstituting our derived expression for the internal pressure:\n$$ \\Delta U = \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} \\frac{an^2}{V^2} dV $$\nThe parameters $a$ and $n$ are constants, so we can move them outside the integral:\n$$ \\Delta U = an^2 \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} V^{-2} dV $$\nPerforming the definite integration yields:\n$$ \\Delta U = an^2 \\left[ -\\frac{1}{V} \\right]_{V_1}^{V_2} = an^2 \\left( \\left(-\\frac{1}{V_2}\\right) - \\left(-\\frac{1}{V_1}\\right) \\right) $$\nThis simplifies to the final analytical expression for the change in internal energy:\n$$ \\Delta U = an^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{V_1} - \\frac{1}{V_2} \\right) $$\nAs the problem specifies an expansion, $V_2 > V_1$, it follows that $\\frac{1}{V_1} > \\frac{1}{V_2}$. Therefore, the term $\\left( \\frac{1}{V_1} - \\frac{1}{V_2} \\right)$ is positive, and $\\Delta U > 0$.

Three such scenarios are:\n\n1.  **Reactions at High Pressure:** At high pressures, the ideal gas assumption (Assumption A) fails. Intermolecular forces and the finite volume of gas molecules become significant.\n    *   **Modification:** One must use a real gas equation of state, e.g., $pV = ZnRT$, where $Z$ is the compressibility factor. The term $p\\Delta V$ must be calculated from $\\Delta(pV) = \\Delta(Zn_{\\mathrm{gas}}RT)$. Since $Z$ depends on pressure, temperature, and composition, this calculation is complex. Alternatively, one returns to the exact relation $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{rxn}} = \\Delta U_{\\mathrm{rxn}} + p\\sum_i \\nu_i \\bar{V}_i$, where the partial molar volumes $\\bar{V}_i$ for gases must be determined from real gas data or a suitable equation of state.\n\n2.  **Reactions Involving Only Condensed Phases, Especially at High Pressure:** For reactions with no gaseous species, $\\Delta n_{\\mathrm{gas}} = 0$, and the derived formula predicts $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{rxn}} = \\Delta U_{\\mathrm{rxn}}$. This implies $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{rxn}} \\approx 0$, which is the essence of Assumption B. While often a good approximation at atmospheric pressure, this is incorrect at high pressures where the $p\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{cond}}$ term can be substantial. An example is the phase transition of graphite to diamond, $\\mathrm{C(graphite)} \\to \\mathrm{C(diamond)}$.\n    *   **Modification:** The term $p\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{cond}}$ cannot be neglected. The exact relation $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{rxn}} = \\Delta U_{\\mathrm{rxn}} + p\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{rxn}}$ must be used, where $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{rxn}} = \\sum_i \\nu_i \\bar{V}_i$. The partial molar volumes $\\bar{V}_i$ (which for pure solids are simply the molar volumes, $M_i/\\rho_i$) must be known to compute the correction term.\n\n3.  **Reactions in Solution (e.g., Aqueous Phase):** When a reaction occurs in a solvent, the volume changes associated with dissolving or reacting species are not simple to model. The volume of a mole of a substance in solution (its partial molar volume) is not necessarily equal to its molar volume as a pure substance and is certainly not given by the ideal gas law if it is a gas dissolving in a liquid.\n    *   **Modification:** Both assumptions are generally invalid. The volume change term must be calculated as $\\Delta V_{\\mathrm{rxn}} = \\sum_i \\nu_i \\bar{V}_i$, using the appropriate partial molar volumes for each species (solutes, solvent, solids, gases) in the context of the solution at the specific concentration, temperature, and pressure. These values are often determined experimentally. The ideal gas law is inapplicable for dissolved species.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{rxn}} = \\Delta U_{\\mathrm{rxn}} + \\Delta n_{\\mathrm{gas}} R T } $$", "id": "2959142"}]}
