Express the final entropy change in joules per kelvin.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of the entropy of mixing for two ideal gases, a subsequent numerical calculation, and a conceptual analysis of the case where the gases are identical. The derivation must originate from fundamental principles.\n\nThe fundamental thermodynamic relation for a closed system undergoing a reversible process is given by the combined first and second laws of thermodynamics:\n$$dU = \\delta q_{\\mathrm{rev}} - \\delta w_{\\mathrm{rev}} = TdS - PdV$$\nFrom this, the change in entropy $dS$ for a change in state can be expressed as:\n$$dS = \\frac{dU}{T} + \\frac{PdV}{T}$$\nFor an ideal gas, the internal energy $U$ is a function of temperature only, so $dU = C_V dT$, where $C_V$ is the heat capacity at constant volume. The ideal gas equation of state is $PV = nRT$.\n\nThe process described is the removal of a partition between two ideal gases, $A$ and $B$, within a rigid, thermally insulated vessel. This is an irreversible process.\n1. The vessel is rigid, so no work is done on the surroundings: $w = 0$.\n2. The walls are thermally insulating, so no heat is exchanged with the surroundings: $q = 0$.\nAccording to the first law of thermodynamics, the change in the internal energy of the total system is $\\Delta U = q + w = 0$.\nThe total internal energy is the sum of the internal energies of the two gases, $U = U_A + U_B$. Since the gases are ideal, $U_A$ and $U_B$ depend only on their respective temperatures. The total internal energy before mixing is $U_{\\mathrm{initial}} = U_A(T) + U_B(T)$. After mixing, the total internal energy is $U_{\\mathrm{final}}$. Since $\\Delta U = 0$, we have $U_{\\mathrm{final}} = U_{\\mathrm{initial}}$. For ideal gases, this implies that the final equilibrium temperature must be the same as the initial temperature, $T$. Therefore, the mixing process is isothermal.\n\nTo calculate the entropy change for this irreversible process, we must devise a reversible path between the same initial and final states. The initial state consists of gas $A$ in volume $V_{A}^{0}$ and gas $B$ in volume $V_{B}^{0}$, both at temperature $T$. The final state consists of a mixture of gases $A$ and $B$, with each gas occupying the total volume $V_{\\mathrm{total}} = V_{A}^{0} + V_{B}^{0}$ at temperature $T$.\n\nA suitable reversible path treats the expansion of each gas independently. We can imagine gas $A$ isothermally and reversibly expanding from its initial volume $V_{A}^{0}$ to the final volume $V_{\\mathrm{total}}$. Simultaneously, gas $B$ isothermally and reversibly expands from its initial volume $V_{B}^{0}$ to the final volume $V_{\\mathrm{total}}$. The total entropy change, $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}}$, is the sum of the entropy changes for each gas, $\\Delta S_A$ and $\\Delta S_B$.\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}} = \\Delta S_A + \\Delta S_B$$\nFor an isothermal process involving an ideal gas, $dT=0$, thus $dU = C_V dT = 0$. The expression for $dS$ simplifies to:\n$$dS = \\frac{P}{T}dV$$\nUsing the ideal gas law, $P/T = nR/V$, we have:\n$$dS = nR \\frac{dV}{V}$$\nIntegrating from an initial volume $V_i$ to a final volume $V_f$ at constant temperature gives the entropy change for the isothermal expansion:\n$$\\Delta S = \\int_{V_i}^{V_f} nR \\frac{dV}{V} = nR \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_f}{V_i}\\right)$$\nWe apply this result to both gases $A$ and $B$.\nFor gas $A$: $\\Delta S_A = n_A R \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{total}}}{V_A^0}\\right)$.\nFor gas $B$: $\\Delta S_B = n_B R \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{\\mathrm{total}}}{V_B^0}\\right)$.\n\nThe problem states that initially, both compartments are at the same temperature $T$ and pressure $P$.

Since $T$ and $P$ are the same, the molar volume $V_m = V/n = RT/P$ is the same in both compartments.\nThe final state, after removing the partition, is $n_{\\mathrm{total}} = n_A+n_B$ moles of the gas in a volume $V_{\\mathrm{total}} = V_A^0+V_B^0$. The final molar volume is $V_{\\mathrm{total}}/n_{\\mathrm{total}} = (V_A^0+V_B^0)/(n_A+n_B)$. Since $V_A^0 = n_A V_m$ and $V_B^0 = n_B V_m$, the final molar volume is $(n_A V_m + n_B V_m)/(n_A+n_B) = V_m$.\nThe final temperature is $T$, and the final pressure is $P_{\\mathrm{final}} = n_{\\mathrm{total}}RT/V_{\\mathrm{total}} = n_{\\mathrm{total}}R T / (n_{\\mathrm{total}}V_m) = RT/V_m = P$.\nThus, the final macroscopic state (defined by $T$, $P$, and molar volume $V_m$) is identical to the initial macroscopic state. Removing the partition between two identical gases at the same $T$ and $P$ causes no change in the thermodynamic state of the system.\n\nThe derivation for distinguishable gases is invalid here because it presumes that the particles are identifiable based on their origin (compartment $A$ or $B$). For identical, indistinguishable particles, this distinction is meaningless. We cannot say that the gas from compartment $A$ has \"expanded\" to fill the whole volume, as it is indistinguishable from the gas already present in compartment $B$. The concept of \"mixing\" does not apply.\nSince entropy is a state function, and the initial and final macroscopic states of the system are identical, the change in entropy must be zero.\nThe implication for $\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}}$ is therefore:\n$$\\Delta S_{\\mathrm{mix}} = 0$$\nThis result is known as the Gibbs paradox. The seeming discontinuity (the entropy of mixing does not gradually go to zero as two gases become more and more similar) is resolved by quantum mechanics, which posits that particles of the same species are fundamentally indistinguishable.

The term $V - nb$ can be interpreted as the \"free volume\" available for the gas molecules to move within. The entropy change is thus a function of the ratio of the final free volume to the initial free volume. For the specified compression, $V_2  V_1$, which implies $V_2 - nb  V_1 - nb$. Consequently, the ratio $\\frac{V_2 - nb}{V_1 - nb}$ is a positive number less than $1$. The natural logarithm of a number between $0$ and $1$ is negative. As $n$ and $R$ are positive constants, the total entropy change $\\Delta S$ is negative, which is the expected result for a compression process where the positional disorder of the system decreases.\n\nThe presence of the parameter $b$ increases the magnitude of the entropy change compared to an ideal gas. For an ideal gas, $b=0$, and the entropy change is $\\Delta S_{ideal} = nR \\ln(V_2/V_1)$. One can show that for $V_1  V_2  nb  0$, the inequality $\\frac{V_2 - nb}{V_1 - nb}  \\frac{V_2}{V_1}$ holds. Since the logarithm is a strictly increasing function, this leads to $\\ln\\left(\\frac{V_2 - nb}{V_1 - nb}\\right)  \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_2}{V_1}\\right)$. Both are negative, meaning $\\Delta S$ for the van der Waals gas is more negative than for an ideal gas undergoing the same volume change. Thus, $|\\Delta S|  |\\Delta S_{ideal}|$. The reduction in volume from $V_1$ to $V_2$ constitutes a larger fractional reduction in the *available* volume ($V-nb$) than in the total volume ($V$), leading to a more significant decrease in entropy.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{n R \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_2 - n b}{V_1 - n b}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2938083"}]}
