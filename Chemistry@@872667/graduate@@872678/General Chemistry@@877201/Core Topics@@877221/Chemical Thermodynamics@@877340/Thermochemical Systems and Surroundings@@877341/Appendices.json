This exercise [@problem_id:2962212] challenges you to apply the fundamental definitions of isolated, closed, and open systems to a realistic experimental setup—the bomb calorimeter. By carefully accounting for all transfers of matter and energy, including subtle heat leaks and electrical work, you will learn to distinguish between idealized theoretical models and the practical realities of laboratory measurements.", "problem": "A benchtop constant-volume combustion calorimeter (“bomb calorimeter”) is used to determine the energy released by a combustible solid sample. The physical assembly consists of a thick-walled steel bomb, a surrounding well-stirred water jacket, and an ignition wire that passes through hermetic electrical feedthroughs in the bomb head and contacts the sample. The calorimeter is placed inside an insulating shell exposed to laboratory air at approximately constant temperature.

The experimental window of interest is the interval from the instant of ignition until data acquisition stops, lasting $10$ min.\n\nDefine the thermodynamic system by the following fixed boundary: everything mechanically and thermally inside the insulating shell that includes the steel bomb, the entire water jacket, and the ignition wire up to and including the bomb’s electrical feedthroughs.

This constitutes heat transfer across the system boundary.\n- **Energy Transfer (Work)**: An \"ignition pulse supplies approximately $10\\,\\mathrm{J}$ of electrical energy to the wire\" from an \"external power supply\". Since the power supply is in the surroundings and the wire terminator (the feedthrough) is part of the system boundary, this is an energy transfer in the form of electrical work across the boundary.\n- **Constraint**: The classification must be based \"strictly on the fundamental definitions of open, closed, and isolated systems... without appealing to any unstated conventions\".\n\n### Step 2: Validate Using Extracted Givens\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, describing a standard experimental setup (a bomb calorimeter) used in thermochemistry. The system and its boundary are defined with precision. The interactions with the surroundings (heat leak, electrical work) are realistic and quantified. The problem is well-posed, asking for a classification based on fundamental definitions and the provided facts. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or missing critical data. The problem is valid.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\n### Derivation of Solution\nThe classification of a thermodynamic system depends on the nature of the exchanges across its boundary with the surroundings. The fundamental definitions are:\n- An **open system** can exchange both matter and energy with its surroundings.\n- A **closed system** can exchange energy but not matter with its surroundings.\n- An **isolated system** can exchange neither matter nor energy with its surroundings.\n\nWe will analyze the defined system against these definitions over the specified $10\\,\\text{min}$ interval.\n\n1.  **Matter Transfer Analysis**: The problem explicitly states that \"no matter is intentionally vented\". The system is contained within an \"insulating shell\". The bomb itself is \"rigid and tight\". There is no stated mechanism for matter to cross the boundary defined by the outer surface of the insulating shell. Therefore, the total mass within the system boundary remains constant. A system that does not exchange matter with its surroundings cannot be open. It must be either closed or isolated.\n\n2.  **Energy Transfer Analysis**: We must check for any energy crossing the system boundary. The problem describes two distinct energy transfers during the $10\\,\\text{min}$ window:\n    - **Heat ($Q$)**: A \"steady heat leak of order $0.5\\,\\mathrm{W}$\" occurs from the system to the surrounding laboratory air. A power of $0.5\\,\\mathrm{W}$ is equivalent to $0.5\\,\\mathrm{J/s}$. Over a $10\\,\\text{min}$ ($600\\,\\mathrm{s}$) interval, the total heat transferred is $Q \\approx 0.5\\,\\mathrm{J/s} \\times 600\\,\\mathrm{s} = 300\\,\\mathrm{J}$. Since this heat transfer is non-zero, energy is exchanged with the surroundings.\n    - **Work ($W$)**: An \"ignition pulse supplies approximately $10\\,\\mathrm{J}$ of electrical energy\". This energy is delivered from an external power supply (in the surroundings) to the ignition wire (part of the system) via the feedthroughs (part of the boundary). This is a transfer of energy in the form of electrical work, $W_{elec} \\approx 10\\,\\mathrm{J}$, done *on* the system. This is another non-zero energy exchange.\n\n3.  **Conclusion**:\n    - The system does not exchange matter with the surroundings.\n    - The system *does* exchange energy with the surroundings (both heat and work).\n    - According to the fundamental definitions, a system that exchanges energy but not matter is a **closed system**. Because energy exchange is explicitly non-zero, it is **not an isolated system**.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A. Isolated: no matter or energy crosses the system boundary during the $10$ min interval because the calorimeter is insulated and no work interactions occur once sealed.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. The problem explicitly states that energy crosses the boundary in two forms: a heat leak of order $0.5\\,\\mathrm{W}$ and an electrical work input of approximately $10\\,\\mathrm{J}$. Therefore, the claim of \"no... energy crosses\" is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Closed but not isolated: no matter crosses the boundary, but energy does cross via a transient electrical work input at ignition and via nonzero heat exchange across the insulating shell during the $10$ min interval.**\nThis statement correctly identifies that no matter crosses the boundary, classifying the system as closed. It also correctly identifies the two modes of energy transfer that occur: electrical work input and heat exchange. Because energy is exchanged, the system is not isolated. This aligns perfectly with the derivation from first principles.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Open: combustion gases expand and drive energy and matter across the boundary, so both mass and energy cross during the $10$ min interval.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The problem specifies the bomb is \"tight\" and \"no matter is intentionally vented\". The system boundary is the outer insulating shell, which contains all components, including any potential (but unstated) leaks from the bomb itself. There is no mention of matter crossing the overall system boundary. A system that does not exchange matter cannot be open.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Conditionally isolated: if the net heat leak over $10$ min is less than $1\\,\\%$ of the reaction energy, the system should be treated as isolated; otherwise it is closed.**\nThis proposes a practical approximation, not a classification based on fundamental definitions. The problem explicitly forbids this approach by demanding a classification \"strictly on the fundamental definitions... without appealing to any unstated conventions\". The fundamental definition of an isolated system requires *zero* energy transfer, not a \"small enough\" transfer. Furthermore, the reaction energy is not provided, so this condition is not even evaluable.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Closed only if the ignition source is enclosed within the boundary; otherwise the presence of electrical energy transfer requires the system to be treated as open.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. The transfer of energy (in any form, including electrical) across a boundary does not define a system as open; the transfer of *matter* does. A closed system, by definition, allows energy exchange. The external power supply doing work on the system is a classic example of an energy interaction for a closed system. The claim that this interaction requires the system to be open is a misunderstanding of the definitions.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2962212"}, {"introduction": "Thermodynamics provides a powerful framework for relating different forms of energy.

It is a standard, formalizable problem in chemical thermodynamics.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be constructed.\n\nThe fundamental definition of enthalpy ($H$) for any system is given as:\n$$H \\equiv U + pV$$\nwhere $U$ is the internal energy, $p$ is the pressure, and $V$ is the volume.\n\nFor a chemical reaction, the change in enthalpy, $\\Delta H$, is the difference between the enthalpy of the products and the enthalpy of the reactants:\n$$\\Delta H = H_{\\text{products}} - H_{\\text{reactants}}$$\nSimilarly, the change in internal energy, $\\Delta U$, is:\n$$\\Delta U = U_{\\text{products}} - U_{\\text{reactants}}$$\n\nSubstituting the definition of enthalpy for both products and reactants, we have:\n$$\\Delta H = (U_{\\text{products}} + p_{\\text{products}}V_{\\text{products}}) - (U_{\\text{reactants}} + p_{\\text{reactants}}V_{\\text{reactants}})$$\nThis expression holds for a process that takes reactants to products. The states of reactants and products might be at different pressures and volumes. It is more precise to write this in terms of the change in the product $pV$:\n$$\\Delta H = (U_{\\text{products}} - U_{\\text{reactants}}) + (p_{\\text{products}}V_{\\text{products}} - p_{\\text{reactants}}V_{\\text{reactants}})$$\nRecognizing the definitions of $\\Delta U$ and the operator $\\Delta$, this simplifies to:\n$$\\Delta H = \\Delta U + \\Delta(pV)$$\n\nThe problem states that all gaseous species behave as ideal gases. The ideal gas law is $pV = nRT$. The term $\\Delta(pV)$ thus refers to the change in this product from reactants to products. We are given that any condensed phases (liquids or solids) have a negligible contribution to the $pV$ term. Their molar volumes are orders of magnitude smaller than those of gases under typical conditions, and they are treated as incompressible. Therefore, we only need to consider the gaseous components when evaluating $\\Delta(pV)$.\n$$\\Delta(pV) \\approx \\Delta(pV)_{\\text{gas}}$$\nFor the gaseous components, we can apply the ideal gas law:\n$$\\Delta(pV)_{\\text{gas}} = (p V)_{\\text{gas, products}} - (p V)_{\\text{gas, reactants}}$$\n$$\\Delta(pV)_{\\text{gas}} = (n_{\\text{g, products}}RT) - (n_{\\text{g, reactants}}RT)$$\nThe reaction is carried out isothermally, meaning the temperature $T$ is constant. The ideal gas constant $R$ is, by definition, a constant. We can therefore factor out $RT$:\n$$\\Delta(pV) = (n_{\\text{g, products}} - n_{\\text{g, reactants}})RT$$\nThe term $(n_{\\text{g, products}} - n_{\\text{g, reactants}})$ is precisely the definition of the net change in the number of moles of gas per mole of reaction, denoted by $\\Delta n_g$.\n$$\\Delta(pV) = \\Delta n_g RT$$\nSubstituting this result back into our expression for $\\Delta H$ yields the desired relationship:\n$$\\Delta H = \\Delta U + \\Delta n_g RT$$\nTo find the expression for the difference $\\Delta H - \\Delta U$, we simply rearrange the equation:\n$$\\Delta H - \\Delta U = \\Delta n_g RT$$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nNext, we evaluate this difference numerically using the provided data:\n$\\Delta n_g = -1$\n$R = 8.314462618\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$\n$T = 298\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n\nSubstituting these values into our derived expression:\n$$\\Delta H - \\Delta U = (-1) \\times (8.314462618\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}) \\times (298\\ \\mathrm{K})$$\n$$\\Delta H - \\Delta U = -2477.56985\\dots\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in units of $\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$ and rounded to $4$ significant figures.\n$$-2477.56985\\ \\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} = -2.47756985\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures gives:\n$$\\Delta H - \\Delta U \\approx -2.478\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$$\n\nFinally, we address the limits of validity of the derived expression $\\Delta H - \\Delta U = \\Delta n_g RT$. The derivation is contingent upon three key assumptions specified in the problem statement. The expression's validity is restricted to conditions where these assumptions hold.\n1.  **Ideal Gas Behavior**: The relationship is strictly valid only if all gaseous reactants and products behave as ideal gases. This assumption fails under conditions of high pressure or low temperature, where intermolecular forces and molecular volume become significant. For real gases, a more complex equation of state (e.g., the virial equation) would be needed, and the simple relation $\\Delta(pV)=\\Delta n_g RT$ would no longer be accurate. The correction would depend on the specific gas properties and conditions.\n2.  **Negligible Volume of Condensed Phases**: The derivation neglects the volume of any solid or liquid reactants and products and any change in their volume during the reaction, i.e., $\\Delta(pV)_{\\text{condensed}} \\approx 0$. While this is an excellent approximation for most reactions at moderate pressures, it can introduce error in reactions at extremely high pressures where gas molar volumes become comparable to condensed phase molar volumes.\n3.  **Isothermal Conditions**: The derivation critically depends on the process being isothermal (constant T), which allows $T$ to be treated as a constant factor. For a non-isothermal process, where the final temperature differs from the initial temperature, the relationship $\\Delta(pV) = \\Delta(n_gRT)$ would be more complex, i.e., $\\Delta(n_gRT) = n_{g,f}RT_f - n_{g,i}RT_i$. The simple form $\\Delta n_g RT$ would not apply.\n\nIn summary, the expression is an approximation that is highly accurate for reactions involving gases at low to moderate pressures and temperatures well above their condensation points, but it will fail where real gas effects are prominent or when condensed phases play a significant role in the volume change of the system.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{-2.478}\n$$", "id": "2962192"}, {"introduction": "While the ideal solution model provides a useful baseline, most real liquid mixtures exhibit non-ideal behavior due to complex intermolecular interactions.

For the second term, we apply the chain rule:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial H^{E}(x_{1})}{\\partial n_{1}} = \\frac{d H^{E}}{d x_{1}} \\frac{\\partial x_{1}}{\\partial n_{1}} $$\nWe calculate the derivative of $x_{1}$ with respect to $n_{1}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial x_{1}}{\\partial n_{1}} = \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial n_{1}} \\left( \\frac{n_{1}}{n_{1} + n_{2}} \\right) = \\frac{(n_{1} + n_{2})(1) - n_{1}(1)}{(n_{1} + n_{2})^{2}} = \\frac{n_{2}}{(n_{1} + n_{2})^{2}} = \\frac{1}{n_{1} + n_{2}} \\frac{n_{2}}{n_{1} + n_{2}} = \\frac{x_{2}}{n} $$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for $\\bar{H}^{E}_{1}$:\n$$ \\bar{H}^{E}_{1} = H^{E}(x_{1}) + (n_{1} + n_{2}) \\left( \\frac{d H^{E}}{d x_{1}} \\frac{x_{2}}{n_{1} + n_{2}} \\right) $$\nThis simplifies to the required relation:\n$$ \\bar{H}^{E}_{1}(x_{1}) = H^{E}(x_{1}) + x_{2} \\frac{d H^{E}}{d x_{1}} = H^{E}(x_{1}) + (1-x_{1}) \\frac{d H^{E}}{d x_{1}} $$\n\n**Task 3: Evaluation of $\\bar{H}^{E}_{1}$ at $x_{1} = 0.40$**\n\nTo evaluate $\\bar{H}^{E}_{1}$ at $x_{1} = 0.40$, a value for $H^{E}(0.40)$ and its derivative $(\\frac{d H^{E}}{d x_{1}})_{x_{1}=0.40}$ are needed.\nFrom the problem data, $H^{E}(x_{1}=0.40) = 0.4608$ kJ mol$^{-1}$.\nNext, we find the derivative of the Redlich-Kister model with the determined parameters $A_{0}=1.8$ and $A_{1}=-0.6$. The model is:\n$$ H^{E}(x_{1}) = (x_{1} - x_{1}^{2})[A_{0} + A_{1}(2x_{1} - 1)] $$\nWe differentiate with respect to $x_1$ using the product rule:\n$$ \\frac{d H^{E}}{d x_{1}} = (1 - 2x_{1})[A_{0} + A_{1}(2x_{1} - 1)] + (x_{1} - x_{1}^{2})[2A_{1}] $$\nNow, we evaluate this derivative at $x_{1} = 0.40$:\n$$ \\left(\\frac{d H^{E}}{d x_{1}}\\right)_{x_{1}=0.40} = (1 - 2(0.40))[1.8 + (-0.6)(2(0.40) - 1)] + (0.40 - (0.40)^{2})[2(-0.6)] $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{d H^{E}}{d x_{1}}\\right)_{x_{1}=0.40} = (1 - 0.80)[1.8 - 0.6(0.80 - 1)] + (0.40 - 0.16)[-1.2] $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{d H^{E}}{d x_{1}}\\right)_{x_{1}=0.40} = (0.20)[1.8 - 0.6(-0.20)] + (0.24)[-1.2] $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{d H^{E}}{d x_{1}}\\right)_{x_{1}=0.40} = (0.20)[1.8 + 0.12] - 0.288 $$\n$$ \\left(\\frac{d H^{E}}{d x_{1}}\\right)_{x_{1}=0.40} = (0.20)[1.92] - 0.288 = 0.384 - 0.288 = 0.096 $$\nThe derivative at $x_{1} = 0.40$ is $0.096$ kJ mol$^{-1}$.\nFinally, we calculate $\\bar{H}^{E}_{1}(0.40)$ using the relation from Task 2, with $x_{2} = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60$:\n$$ \\bar{H}^{E}_{1}(0.40) = H^{E}(0.40) + (1 - 0.40) \\left(\\frac{d H^{E}}{d x_{1}}\\right)_{x_{1}=0.40} $$\n$$ \\bar{H}^{E}_{1}(0.40) = 0.4608 + (0.60)(0.096) $$\n$$ \\bar{H}^{E}_{1}(0.40) = 0.4608 + 0.0576 = 0.5184 $$\nThe value of the partial molar excess enthalpy of component $1$ at $x_{1}=0.40$ is $0.5184$ kJ mol$^{-1}$.
