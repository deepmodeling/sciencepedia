Under this condition ($dT = 0$), the change in Gibbs free energy depends only on the change in pressure:\n$$\ndG = VdP\n$$\nTo find the total change in Gibbs free energy when the pressure changes from a reference pressure $P_0$ to a final pressure $P$, we must integrate this expression:\n$$\n\\Delta G = G(P) - G(P_0) = \\int_{P_0}^{P} dG = \\int_{P_0}^{P} V(P') dP'\n$$\nwhere $P'$ is the integration variable for pressure.\n\nThe problem provides an empirical model for the volume as a function of pressure:\n$$\nV(P') = V_0 \\left( 1 - \\kappa_T (P' - P_0) \\right)\n$$\nwhere $V_0$ is the volume at the reference pressure $P_0$, and the isothermal compressibility $\\kappa_T$ is treated as a constant over the pressure range of interest.\n\nWe substitute this expression for $V(P')$ into the integral:\n$$\nG(P) - G(P_0) = \\int_{P_0}^{P} V_0 \\left( 1 - \\kappa_T (P' - P_0) \\right) dP'\n$$\nSince $V_0$, $\\kappa_T$, and $P_0$ are constants with respect to the integration variable $P'$, we can perform the integration:\n$$\nG(P) - G(P_0) = V_0 \\int_{P_0}^{P} \\left( 1 - \\kappa_T P' + \\kappa_T P_0 \\right) dP'\n$$\nIntegrating term-by-term:\n$$\nG(P) - G(P_0) = V_0 \\left[ P' - \\frac{\\kappa_T}{2} P'^2 + \\kappa_T P_0 P' \\right]_{P_0}^{P}\n$$\nNow, we evaluate the definite integral at the limits $P$ and $P_0$:\n$$\nG(P) - G(P_0) = V_0 \\left\\{ \\left(P - \\frac{\\kappa_T}{2} P^2 + \\kappa_T P_0 P\\right) - \\left(P_0 - \\frac{\\kappa_T}{2} P_0^2 + \\kappa_T P_0 P_0\\right) \\right\\}\n$$\n$$\nG(P) - G(P_0) = V_0 \\left\\{ (P - P_0) - \\frac{\\kappa_T}{2} (P^2 - P_0^2) + \\kappa_T P_0 (P - P_0) \\right\\}\n$$\nTo simplify this expression, we factor out the common term $(P - P_0)$ and use the identity $P^2 - P_0^2 = (P - P_0)(P + P_0)$:\n$$\nG(P) - G(P_0) = V_0 (P - P_0) \\left\\{ 1 - \\frac{\\kappa_T}{2} (P + P_0) + \\kappa_T P_0 \\right\\}\n$$\nSimplifying the expression within the curly braces:\n$$\n1 - \\frac{\\kappa_T}{2} (P + P_0) + \\kappa_T P_0 = 1 - \\frac{\\kappa_T P}{2} - \\frac{\\kappa_T P_0}{2} + \\kappa_T P_0 = 1 - \\frac{\\kappa_T P}{2} + \\frac{\\kappa_T P_0}{2} = 1 - \\frac{\\kappa_T}{2} (P - P_0)\n$$\nSubstituting this back gives the final, compact expression for the change in Gibbs free energy:\n$$\nG(P) - G(P_0) = V_0 (P - P_0) \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\kappa_T}{2} (P - P_0) \\right)\n$$\nThis result is consistent with the problem's constraints, as integrating the given linear-in-$P$ expression for volume must yield a result that is quadratic in $P$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{V_0 (P - P_0) \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\kappa_T}{2} (P - P_0) \\right)}\n$$", "id": "2940086"}, {"introduction": "When we move from pure substances to mixtures, the chemical potential $\\mu_i$ becomes the central quantity governing equilibrium.

The activity coefficient $\\gamma_i$ of component $i$ in a binary mixture is related to the molar excess Gibbs free energy $g^E$ through the partial molar excess Gibbs free energy, $\\bar{g}_i^E$. The relationship is given by:\n$$ \\ln \\gamma_i = \\frac{\\bar{g}_i^E}{R T} $$\nThe partial molar properties are related to the total molar property. For component $1$:\n$$ \\bar{g}_1^E = g^E + (1-x_1) \\frac{d g^E}{d x_1} $$\nFor component $2$:\n$$ \\bar{g}_2^E = g^E - x_1 \\frac{d g^E}{d x_1} $$\nUsing the dimensionless function $f(x_1) = g^E / (RT)$, these relations become:\n$$ \\ln \\gamma_1 = f(x_1) + (1-x_1) \\frac{d f(x_1)}{d x_1} = f(x_1) + x_2 \\frac{d f(x_1)}{d x_1} $$\n$$ \\ln \\gamma_2 = f(x_1) - x_1 \\frac{d f(x_1)}{d x_1} $$\nThe given model is:\n$$ f(x_1) = x_1 x_2 (A_{12} x_2 + A_{21} x_1) = A_{12} x_1 x_2^2 + A_{21} x_1^2 x_2 $$\nSubstituting $x_2 = 1 - x_1$:\n$$ f(x_1) = A_{12} x_1 (1-x_1)^2 + A_{21} x_1^2 (1-x_1) $$\nWe compute the derivative of $f(x_1)$ with respect to $x_1$:\n$$ \\frac{d f(x_1)}{d x_1} = \\frac{d}{dx_1} [A_{12} x_1 (1-x_1)^2] + \\frac{d}{dx_1} [A_{21} x_1^2 (1-x_1)] $$\nUsing the product rule:\n$$ \\frac{d f(x_1)}{d x_1} = A_{12} [1 \\cdot (1-x_1)^2 + x_1 \\cdot 2(1-x_1)(-1)] + A_{21} [2x_1 (1-x_1) + x_1^2 (-1)] $$\n$$ \\frac{d f(x_1)}{d x_1} = A_{12} [(1-x_1)^2 - 2x_1(1-x_1)] + A_{21} [2x_1(1-x_1) - x_1^2] $$\nFactoring terms:\n$$ \\frac{d f(x_1)}{d x_1} = A_{12} x_2(x_2 - 2x_1) + A_{21} x_1(2x_2 - x_1) $$\nNow, we substitute $f(x_1)$ and its derivative into the expression for $\\ln \\gamma_1$:\n$$ \\ln \\gamma_1 = (A_{12} x_1 x_2^2 + A_{21} x_1^2 x_2) + x_2 [A_{12} x_2(x_2 - 2x_1) + A_{21} x_1(2x_2 - x_1)] $$\nCollecting terms for $A_{12}$ and $A_{21}$:\n$$ \\ln \\gamma_1 = A_{12} [x_1 x_2^2 + x_2^2(x_2 - 2x_1)] + A_{21} [x_1^2 x_2 + x_1 x_2(2x_2 - x_1)] $$\n$$ \\ln \\gamma_1 = A_{12} [x_1 x_2^2 + x_2^3 - 2x_1 x_2^2] + A_{21} [x_1^2 x_2 + 2x_1 x_2^2 - x_1^2 x_2] $$\n$$ \\ln \\gamma_1 = A_{12} [x_2^3 - x_1 x_2^2] + A_{21} [2x_1 x_2^2] $$\n$$ \\ln \\gamma_1 = A_{12} x_2^2(x_2 - x_1) + 2A_{21} x_1 x_2^2 $$\nUsing $x_2 - x_1 = (1-x_1) - x_1 = 1 - 2x_1$, we can write this in a more standard form:\n$$ \\ln \\gamma_1 = A_{12} x_2^2(1 - 2x_1) + 2A_{21} x_1 x_2^2 = x_2^2 [A_{12}(1 - 2x_1) + 2A_{21} x_1] $$\n$$ \\ln \\gamma_1 = x_2^2 [A_{12} - 2A_{12} x_1 + 2A_{21} x_1] = x_2^2 [A_{12} + 2(A_{21} - A_{12})x_1] $$\nThe activity coefficient is $\\gamma_1(x_1) = \\exp \\left( (1-x_1)^2 [A_{12} + 2(A_{21} - A_{12})x_1] \\right)$.\nBy symmetry (exchanging subscripts $1 \\leftrightarrow 2$ and parameters $A_{12} \\leftrightarrow A_{21}$), we find $\\ln \\gamma_2$:\n$$ \\ln \\gamma_2 = x_1^2 [A_{21} + 2(A_{12} - A_{21})x_2] $$\nThe activity coefficient is $\\gamma_2(x_1) = \\exp \\left( x_1^2 [A_{21} + 2(A_{12} - A_{21})(1-x_1)] \\right)$.\n\nThe molar excess Gibbs free energy $g^E(x_1)$ is explicitly:\n$$ g^{E}(x_1) = R T x_1(1-x_1)[A_{12}(1-x_1) + A_{21}x_1] $$\n\nThe rational osmotic coefficient $\\phi_x$ is defined as $\\phi_x \\equiv \\ln(a_1) / \\ln(x_1)$.
