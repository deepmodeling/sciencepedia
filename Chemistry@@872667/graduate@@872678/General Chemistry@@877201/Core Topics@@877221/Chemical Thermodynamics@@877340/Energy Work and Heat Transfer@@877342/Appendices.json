Before embarking on the calculation, a rigorous validation of the problem statement is necessary.\n\nStep 1: Extract Givens\nThe system is $n$ moles of an ideal gas with a constant molar heat capacity at constant volume, $C_V$. The process is a reversible rectangular cycle on a Pressure-Volume ($P$-$V$) diagram, traversed through states $1 \\to 2 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 1$.\nThe states are defined by pressures $P_1, P_2$ (with $P_2 > P_1 > 0$) and volumes $V_1, V_2$ (with $V_2 > V_1 > 0$).\nThe legs are:\n-   $1 \\to 2$: Isobaric expansion at $P=P_1$ from $V_1$ to $V_2$. State coordinates are $1:(P_1, V_1)$ and $2:(P_1, V_2)$.\n-   $2 \\to 3$: Isochoric heating at $V=V_2$ from $P_1$ to $P_2$. State coordinates are $2:(P_1, V_2)$ and $3:(P_2, V_2)$.\n-   $3 \\to 4$: Isobaric compression at $P=P_2$ from $V_2$ to $V_1$. State coordinates are $3:(P_2, V_2)$ and $4:(P_2, V_1)$.\n-   $4 \\to 1$: Isochoric cooling at $V=V_1$ from $P_2$ to $P_1$. State coordinates are $4:(P_2, V_1)$ and $1:(P_1, V_1)$.\n\nThe problem specifies the use of the chemistry sign convention, where the First Law of Thermodynamics is $\\Delta U = q + w$. Here, $q$ is heat transferred into the system and $w$ is work done on the system.\nThe derivation must be based on these fundamental statements:\n1.  Ideal Gas Law: $P V = n R T$\n2.  First Law of Thermodynamics: $\\Delta U = q + w$\n3.  Reversible work: $w = -\\int P\\,\\mathrm{d}V$\n4.  Internal energy of an ideal gas: $\\mathrm{d}U = n C_V\\,\\mathrm{d}T$\n\nThe final expressions must be in terms of $P_1, P_2, V_1, V_2, R,$ and $C_V$.\n\nStep 2: Validate a priori\nThe problem describes a standard, albeit specific, thermodynamic cycle. It is based on established principles of thermodynamics and the ideal gas model. The problem is self-contained, with all necessary parameters and laws provided for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. There are no scientific contradictions or infeasible conditions. The system described corresponds to a refrigeration cycle, where net work is done on the system to transfer heat, which is a physically sound process. The problem is valid.\n\nStep 3: Derivation\nThe derivation will proceed by calculating the work $w$ and change in internal energy $\\Delta U$ for each leg of the cycle. The heat transfer $q$ will then be determined from the First Law, $q = \\Delta U - w$.\n\nFirst, we establish a general expression for the change in internal energy, $\\Delta U$, for any process involving this ideal gas. From $\\mathrm{d}U = n C_V\\,\\mathrm{d}T$ and the ideal gas law $T = \\frac{PV}{nR}$, we can write the differential of temperature as $\\mathrm{d}T = \\frac{1}{nR}\\mathrm{d}(PV)$. Substituting this into the expression for $\\mathrm{d}U$ yields $\\mathrm{d}U = n C_V \\left(\\frac{1}{nR}\\mathrm{d}(PV)\\right) = \\frac{C_V}{R}\\mathrm{d}(PV)$. Integrating this for a finite process from an initial state $(P_i, V_i)$ to a final state $(P_f, V_f)$ gives:\n$$\n\\Delta U = \\frac{C_V}{R} (P_f V_f - P_i V_i)\n$$\nThis relation is crucial as it allows calculation of $\\Delta U$ without explicit use of temperature $T$ or the number of moles $n$.\n\nCalculation of Net Work, $w_{\\mathrm{net}}$\nThe net work for the cycle is the sum of the work for each leg: $w_{\\mathrm{net}} = w_{12} + w_{23} + w_{34} + w_{41}$. Using the definition $w = -\\int P\\,\\mathrm{d}V$:\n-   Leg $1 \\to 2$ (isobaric expansion at $P_1$):\n    $w_{12} = -\\int_{V_1}^{V_2} P_1\\,\\mathrm{d}V = -P_1(V_2 - V_1)$\n-   Leg $2 \\to 3$ (isochoric process, $\\mathrm{d}V=0$):\n    $w_{23} = 0$\n-   Leg $3 \\to 4$ (isobaric compression at $P_2$):\n    $w_{34} = -\\int_{V_2}^{V_1} P_2\\,\\mathrm{d}V = -P_2(V_1 - V_2) = P_2(V_2 - V_1)$\n-   Leg $4 \\to 1$ (isochoric process, $\\mathrm{d}V=0$):\n    $w_{41} = 0$\n\nThe net work is the sum:\n$w_{\\mathrm{net}} = -P_1(V_2 - V_1) + 0 + P_2(V_2 - V_1) + 0 = (P_2 - P_1)(V_2 - V_1)$.\nSince $P_2 > P_1$ and $V_2 > V_1$, $w_{\\mathrm{net}}$ is positive, indicating that net work is performed on the system over the cycle.\n\nCalculation of Heat Transfers, $q_{12}, q_{23}, q_{34}, q_{41}$\nWe calculate the heat transfer for each leg using $q = \\Delta U - w$.\n\n-   Leg $1 \\to 2$:\n    $\\Delta U_{12} = \\frac{C_V}{R}(P_1V_2 - P_1V_1) = \\frac{C_V}{R}P_1(V_2-V_1)$.\n    $w_{12} = -P_1(V_2 - V_1)$.\n    $q_{12} = \\Delta U_{12} - w_{12} = \\frac{C_V}{R}P_1(V_2-V_1) - (-P_1(V_2-V_1)) = \\left(\\frac{C_V}{R} + 1\\right)P_1(V_2-V_1)$.\n\n-   Leg $2 \\to 3$:\n    $\\Delta U_{23} = \\frac{C_V}{R}(P_2V_2 - P_1V_2) = \\frac{C_V}{R}V_2(P_2-P_1)$.\n    $w_{23} = 0$.\n    $q_{23} = \\Delta U_{23} - w_{23} = \\frac{C_V}{R}V_2(P_2-P_1)$.\n\n-   Leg $3 \\to 4$:\n    $\\Delta U_{34} = \\frac{C_V}{R}(P_2V_1 - P_2V_2) = -\\frac{C_V}{R}P_2(V_2-V_1)$.\n    $w_{34} = P_2(V_2-V_1)$.\n    $q_{34} = \\Delta U_{34} - w_{34} = -\\frac{C_V}{R}P_2(V_2-V_1) - P_2(V_2-V_1) = -\\left(\\frac{C_V}{R} + 1\\right)P_2(V_2-V_1)$.\n\n-   Leg $4 \\to 1$:\n    $\\Delta U_{41} = \\frac{C_V}{R}(P_1V_1 - P_2V_1) = -\\frac{C_V}{R}V_1(P_2-P_1)$.\n    $w_{41} = 0$.\n    $q_{41} = \\Delta U_{41} - w_{41} = -\\frac{C_V}{R}V_1(P_2-P_1)$.\n\nThe derived expressions for $w_{\\mathrm{net}}$, $q_{12}$, $q_{23}$, $q_{34}$, and $q_{41}$ are expressed purely in terms of the specified variables. For a cycle, the net change in internal energy must be zero, $\\Delta U_{\\mathrm{net}} = 0$, which implies $q_{\\mathrm{net}} = -w_{\\mathrm{net}}$. Summing the derived heat transfers confirms this: $q_{12}+q_{23}+q_{34}+q_{41} = -(P_2-P_1)(V_2-V_1) = -w_{\\mathrm{net}}$. The results are internally consistent and derived strictly from the given principles.\n\nThe final requested quantities are thus:\n1.  $w_{\\mathrm{net}} = (P_2 - P_1)(V_2 - V_1)$\n2.  $q_{12} = \\left(\\frac{C_V}{R} + 1\\right) P_1 (V_2 - V_1)$\n3.  $q_{23} = \\frac{C_V}{R} V_2 (P_2 - P_1)$\n4.  $q_{34} = -\\left(\\frac{C_V}{R} + 1\\right) P_2 (V_2 - V_1)$\n5.  $q_{41} = -\\frac{C_V}{R} V_1 (P_2 - P_1)$\nThese results are now formatted for the final answer.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} (P_2 - P_1)(V_2 - V_1) & \\left(\\frac{C_V}{R} + 1\\right) P_1 (V_2 - V_1) & \\frac{C_V}{R} V_2 (P_2 - P_1) & -\\left(\\frac{C_V}{R} + 1\\right) P_2 (V_2 - V_1) & -\\frac{C_V}{R} V_1 (P_2 - P_1) \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2937806"}, {"introduction": "While the change in a state function like internal energy is independent of the path taken between two states, the same is not true for work and heat.

It is a standard problem in chemical thermodynamics involving the calculation and comparison of work done by an ideal gas during expansion along different thermodynamic paths. I will proceed with the derivation and analysis.\n\nThe fundamental definition of pressure-volume work ($W$) done on a system as it changes volume from $V_1$ to $V_2$ against a variable external pressure $P_{ext}$ is given by the integral:\n$$ W = -\\int_{V_1}^{V_2} P_{ext} dV $$\nThe problem specifies using the thermodynamic sign convention where work done *by* the system is negative. The expression above adheres to this convention: for an expansion ($V_2 > V_1$), $dV$ is positive, and the integral results in a negative value for work, $W < 0$, signifying that the system performs work on its surroundings.\n\nFor a mechanically reversible process, the system is in continuous equilibrium with its surroundings, which implies that the external pressure $P_{ext}$ is at all times equal to the internal pressure of the gas, $P$. For an irreversible process, $P_{ext}$ is not necessarily equal to $P$, and the specified external pressure must be used.\n\nThe initial state of the system is given by $(P_1, V_1, T_0)$, and it is stated that these quantities are related by the Ideal Gas Law:\n$$ P_1 V_1 = n_{\\mathrm{mol}} R T_0 $$\nThis relationship will be used to simplify the final expressions for work.\n\n**Path (i): Reversible Isothermal Expansion**\nFor this path, the process is reversible, so $P_{ext} = P$. The process is also isothermal at a constant temperature $T = T_0$. For an ideal gas, the pressure is given by $P = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{mol}} R T_0}{V}$.\nThe work done, $W_i$, is calculated as follows:\n$$ W_{i} = -\\int_{V_1}^{V_2} P dV = -\\int_{V_1}^{V_2} \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{mol}} R T_0}{V} dV $$\nSince $n_{\\mathrm{mol}}$, $R$, and $T_0$ are constants, they can be factored out of the integral:\n$$ W_{i} = -n_{\\mathrm{mol}} R T_0 \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} \\frac{1}{V} dV = -n_{\\mathrm{mol}} R T_0 \\left[ \\ln(V) \\right]_{V_1}^{V_2} $$\n$$ W_{i} = -n_{\\mathrm{mol}} R T_0 (\\ln(V_2) - \\ln(V_1)) = -n_{\\mathrm{mol}} R T_0 \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_2}{V_1}\\right) $$\nUsing the initial state condition $P_1 V_1 = n_{\\mathrm{mol}} R T_0$, this can be written as:\n$$ W_{i} = -P_1 V_1 \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_2}{V_1}\\right) $$\n\n**Path (ii): Reversible Polytropic Expansion**\nThis path is reversible, so $P_{ext} = P$. The process follows the relation $P V^{\\alpha} = C$, where $C$ is a constant and $\\alpha \\neq 1$. From the initial state, we find the constant to be $C = P_1 V_1^{\\alpha}$. Thus, the pressure along the path is $P(V) = P_1 V_1^{\\alpha} V^{-\\alpha}$.\nThe work done, $W_{ii}$, is:\n$$ W_{ii} = -\\int_{V_1}^{V_2} P dV = -\\int_{V_1}^{V_2} (P_1 V_1^{\\alpha}) V^{-\\alpha} dV = -P_1 V_1^{\\alpha} \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} V^{-\\alpha} dV $$\nSince $\\alpha \\neq 1$, we can integrate $V^{-\\alpha}$:\n$$ W_{ii} = -P_1 V_1^{\\alpha} \\left[ \\frac{V^{1-\\alpha}}{1-\\alpha} \\right]_{V_1}^{V_2} = - \\frac{P_1 V_1^{\\alpha}}{1-\\alpha} \\left( V_2^{1-\\alpha} - V_1^{1-\\alpha} \\right) $$\nRearranging the terms yields:\n$$ W_{ii} = \\frac{P_1 V_1^{\\alpha}}{\\alpha-1} \\left( V_2^{1-\\alpha} - V_1^{1-\\alpha} \\right) = \\frac{1}{\\alpha-1} \\left( P_1 V_1^{\\alpha} V_2^{1-\\alpha} - P_1 V_1^{\\alpha} V_1^{1-\\alpha} \\right) $$\n$$ W_{ii} = \\frac{P_1 V_1^{\\alpha} V_2^{1-\\alpha} - P_1 V_1}{\\alpha-1} $$\nFactoring out $P_1 V_1$:\n$$ W_{ii} = \\frac{P_1 V_1}{\\alpha-1} \\left( \\frac{V_1^{\\alpha-1}}{V_2^{\\alpha-1}} - 1 \\right) = \\frac{P_1 V_1}{\\alpha-1} \\left( \\left(\\frac{V_2}{V_1}\\right)^{1-\\alpha} - 1 \\right) $$\n\n**Path (iii): Irreversible Expansion Against a Constant External Pressure**\nThis process is irreversible, so we must use the given external pressure $P_{ext}$ in the work integral. The problem states that $P_{ext}$ is constant and chosen such that the system reaches mechanical equilibrium at the final volume $V_2$. This means $P_{ext}$ must be equal to the final pressure of the gas, $P_2$.\nThe process occurs while the cylinder is in contact with a thermal reservoir at temperature $T_0$, which maintains the gas temperature at $T_0$ throughout. Thus, the final temperature is $T_2 = T_0$.\nUsing the Ideal Gas Law for the final state $(P_2, V_2, T_0)$:\n$$ P_2 V_2 = n_{\\mathrm{mol}} R T_0 $$\nSo the constant external pressure is $P_{ext} = P_2 = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{mol}} R T_0}{V_2}$.\nUsing the initial condition, this can be rewritten as $P_{ext} = \\frac{P_1 V_1}{V_2}$.\nThe work, $W_{iii}$, is:\n$$ W_{iii} = -\\int_{V_1}^{V_2} P_{ext} dV = -P_{ext} \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} dV = -P_{ext} (V_2 - V_1) $$\nSubstituting $P_{ext} = \\frac{P_1 V_1}{V_2}$:\n$$ W_{iii} = -\\frac{P_1 V_1}{V_2} (V_2 - V_1) = -P_1 V_1 \\left(1 - \\frac{V_1}{V_2}\\right) $$\n\n**Comparison of Work Magnitudes**\nSince the process is an expansion ($V_2 > V_1$), the work done by the system is positive, and according to the sign convention used, the values $W_i$, $W_{ii}$, and $W_{iii}$ are all negative. To compare the \"magnitudes\" of work done, we compare the absolute values $|W|$, which correspond to the total energy transferred as work from the system to the surroundings. This is equivalent to comparing the area under the respective $P_{ext}(V)$ curves from $V_1$ to $V_2$ on a $P-V$ diagram. Let $W_{by} = -W = \\int_{V_1}^{V_2} P_{ext} dV$. A \"larger\" work corresponds to a larger value of $W_{by}$.\n\nLet $x = V_2/V_1 > 1$. The work magnitudes (scaled by $P_1 V_1$) are:\n$|W_i| / (P_1 V_1) = \\ln(x)$\n$|W_{ii}| / (P_1 V_1) = \\frac{1 - x^{1-\\alpha}}{\\alpha-1}$\n$|W_{iii}| / (P_1 V_1) = 1 - 1/x$\n\nComparison of Reversible Isothermal work ($|W_i|$) and Irreversible work ($|W_{iii}|$):\nFor a reversible expansion, the external pressure $P_{ext} = P(V) = P_1V_1/V$ decreases as volume increases. For the irreversible expansion, the external pressure is held constant at the final, lowest pressure, $P_{ext} = P_2 = P_1V_1/V_2$. For any intermediate volume $V \\in (V_1, V_2)$, we have $P(V) = P_1V_1/V > P_1V_1/V_2 = P_{ext}$. Since the pressure for the reversible path is always greater than the pressure for the irreversible path (except at the end point), the work done is greater for the reversible path.\nTherefore, $|W_i| > |W_{iii}|$. This is a general principle: maximum expansion work is obtained via a reversible path.\n\nComparison involving Polytropic work ($|W_{ii}|$):\nTo compare the polytropic path to the isothermal path, we examine the pressures along each path starting from $(P_1, V_1)$.\n$P_{ii}(V) = P_1(V_1/V)^\\alpha$ and $P_i(V) = P_1(V_1/V)$.\nFor $V > V_1$, the ratio $V_1/V < 1$.\n\nCase 1: Regime $\\alpha > 1$\nHere, $\\alpha - 1 > 0$. Thus, $(V_1/V)^{\\alpha-1} < 1$, which implies $P_1(V_1/V)^\\alpha < P_1(V_1/V)$, so $P_{ii}(V) < P_i(V)$ for $V > V_1$.\nThe polytropic curve lies below the isothermal curve. Consequently, the area under the curve is smaller: $|W_{ii}| < |W_i|$. The overall ordering is $|W_i| > |W_{ii}|$ and $|W_i| > |W_{iii}|$. The relative order of $|W_{ii}|$ and $|W_{iii}|$ depends on the value of $\\alpha$.\n\nCase 2: Regime $\\alpha < 1$\nHere, $\\alpha - 1 < 0$. Thus, $(V_1/V)^{\\alpha-1} > 1$, which implies $P_1(V_1/V)^\\alpha > P_1(V_1/V)$, so $P_{ii}(V) > P_i(V)$ for $V > V_1$.\nThe polytropic curve lies above the isothermal curve. Consequently, the area under the curve is larger: $|W_{ii}| > |W_i|$.\nCombining this with our established fact that $|W_i| > |W_{iii}|$, the complete ordering of work magnitudes is:\n$$ |W_{ii}| > |W_i| > |W_{iii}| $$\nIn summary, for an expansion, the reversible isothermal process yields more work than the irreversible one. The polytropic work can be greater or smaller than the isothermal work, depending on whether the gas heats up ($\\alpha < 1$) or cools down ($\\alpha > 1$) during the expansion.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{ \\begin{pmatrix} -P_{1} V_{1} \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{2}}{V_{1}}\\right) & \\frac{P_{1} V_{1}}{\\alpha-1} \\left( \\left(\\frac{V_{2}}{V_{1}}\\right)^{1-\\alpha} - 1 \\right) & -P_{1} V_{1} \\left(1 - \\frac{V_{1}}{V_{2}}\\right) \\end{pmatrix} } $$", "id": "2937841"}, {"introduction": "We have seen that a reversible expansion produces more work than an irreversible one between the same states.

Since both processes connect states with the same initial and final temperature $T$, the overall change in internal energy is zero for both processes:\n$$\n\\Delta U = 0\n$$\n\nThe work done by the system on the surroundings is defined by the integral:\n$$\nW_{\\mathrm{out}} = \\int_{V_{1}}^{V_{2}} P_{\\mathrm{ext}} dV\n$$\nwhere $P_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ is the external pressure against which the expansion occurs.\n\nAnalysis of Process (i): Reversible Isothermal Expansion\nFor a reversible (quasistatic) process, the system is always in mechanical equilibrium with its surroundings, which implies that the external pressure $P_{\\mathrm{ext}}$ is equal to the internal pressure of the gas $P$.\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{ext}} = P\n$$\nThe ideal gas equation of state is $PV = nRT$. We can express the pressure as $P = \\frac{nRT}{V}$.\nSubstituting this into the definition of work for the reversible process:\n$$\nW_{\\mathrm{out,rev}} = \\int_{V_{1}}^{V_{2}} P dV = \\int_{V_{1}}^{V_{2}} \\frac{nRT}{V} dV\n$$\nSince the process is isothermal, the temperature $T$ is constant. The constants $n$ and $R$ can be moved outside the integral:\n$$\nW_{\\mathrm{out,rev}} = nRT \\int_{V_{1}}^{V_{2}} \\frac{1}{V} dV = nRT [\\ln(V)]_{V_{1}}^{V_{2}}\n$$\nEvaluating the definite integral, we find the work done in the reversible isothermal expansion:\n$$\nW_{\\mathrm{out,rev}} = nRT (\\ln(V_{2}) - \\ln(V_{1})) = nRT \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{2}}{V_{1}}\\right)\n$$\n\nAnalysis of Process (ii): Free Expansion\nA free expansion is an expansion against zero external pressure, as the gas expands into a vacuum. Therefore, $P_{\\mathrm{ext}} = 0$.\nThe work done by the system is:\n$$\nW_{\\mathrm{out,free}} = \\int_{V_{1}}^{V_{2}} P_{\\mathrm{ext}} dV = \\int_{V_{1}}^{V_{2}} 0 \\cdot dV = 0\n$$\nAs stated in the problem, the vessel is adiabatic, so $Q_{\\mathrm{free}} = 0$. From the first law, $\\Delta U = Q_{\\mathrm{free}} - W_{\\mathrm{out,free}} = 0 - 0 = 0$. This confirms the given information that for an ideal gas undergoing free expansion, the temperature remains constant.\n\nCalculation of the difference in work, $\\Delta W_{\\mathrm{out}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta W_{\\mathrm{out}} = W_{\\mathrm{out,rev}} - W_{\\mathrm{out,free}}\n$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions:\n$$\n\\Delta W_{\\mathrm{out}} = nRT \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{2}}{V_{1}}\\right) - 0 = nRT \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{2}}{V_{1}}\\right)\n$$\nThis is the required expression.\n\nInterpretation of $\\Delta W_{\\mathrm{out}}$ in terms of entropy production:\nThe entropy balance for a closed system undergoing a process is:\n$$\n\\Delta S = \\int \\frac{\\delta Q}{T_{b}} + S_{\\mathrm{gen}}\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta S$ is the change in the system's entropy, $T_{b}$ is the temperature at the boundary where heat $\\delta Q$ is transferred, and $S_{\\mathrm{gen}}$ is the total entropy produced due to irreversibilities within the system and its surroundings.\n\nEntropy $S$ is a state function. Therefore, its change $\\Delta S$ between the initial state $(T, V_{1})$ and the final state $(T, V_{2})$ is independent of the path taken. We can calculate this $\\Delta S$ using the reversible path (process i).\nFor the reversible isothermal expansion (process i), $S_{\\mathrm{gen}} = 0$ by definition of reversibility. The heat transfer occurs at a constant boundary temperature $T_{b} = T$.\n$$\n\\Delta S = \\int \\frac{\\delta Q_{\\mathrm{rev}}}{T} = \\frac{1}{T} \\int \\delta Q_{\\mathrm{rev}} = \\frac{Q_{\\mathrm{rev}}}{T}\n$$\nFrom the first law for process (i), $\\Delta U = 0$, so $Q_{\\mathrm{rev}} = W_{\\mathrm{out,rev}}$.\nTherefore, the change in entropy is:\n$$\n\\Delta S = \\frac{W_{\\mathrm{out,rev}}}{T} = \\frac{1}{T} \\left( nRT \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{2}}{V_{1}}\\right) \\right) = nR \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{2}}{V_{1}}\\right)\n$$\nNow, we apply the entropy balance to the irreversible free expansion (process ii). For this process, the vessel is adiabatic, so $Q_{\\mathrm{free}} = 0$. The entropy balance becomes:\n$$\n\\Delta S = S_{\\mathrm{gen, free}}\n$$\nSince $\\Delta S$ must be the same for both paths between the same initial and final states:\n$$\nS_{\\mathrm{gen, free}} = \\Delta S = nR \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{2}}{V_{1}}\\right)\n$$\nWe can now relate $\\Delta W_{\\mathrm{out}}$ to $S_{\\mathrm{gen, free}}$. We found:\n$$\n\\Delta W_{\\mathrm{out}} = nRT \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{2}}{V_{1}}\\right)\n$$\nBy substituting the expression for $S_{\\mathrm{gen, free}}$, we obtain:\n$$\n\\Delta W_{\\mathrm{out}} = T \\left( nR \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{2}}{V_{1}}\\right) \\right) = T S_{\\mathrm{gen, free}}\n$$\nSign and physical meaning: Since $V_{2} > V_{1}$, the term $\\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{2}}{V_{1}}\\right)$ is positive. As $n$, $R$, and $T$ are all positive quantities, it follows that $\\Delta W_{\\mathrm{out}} > 0$ and $S_{\\mathrm{gen, free}} > 0$. The positivity of $S_{\\mathrm{gen, free}}$ is required by the second law of thermodynamics for any irreversible process.\nThe quantity $\\Delta W_{\\mathrm{out}}$ is the difference between the maximum possible work that can be extracted from the process (the reversible work) and the actual work obtained in the free expansion (which is zero). This difference, $W_{\\mathrm{out,rev}} - W_{\\mathrm{out,free}}$, represents the \"lost work\" or the work potential that is dissipated and lost forever due to the irreversibility of the free expansion. The relationship $\\Delta W_{\\mathrm{out}} = T S_{\\mathrm{gen, free}}$ is a specific instance of the Gouy-Stodola theorem, which states that the work lost in an irreversible process is equal to the product of the reference environment temperature and the total entropy generated. In this case, $\\Delta W_{\\mathrm{out}}$ is precisely this lost work.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{nRT \\ln\\left(\\frac{V_{2}}{V_{1}}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2937862"}]}
