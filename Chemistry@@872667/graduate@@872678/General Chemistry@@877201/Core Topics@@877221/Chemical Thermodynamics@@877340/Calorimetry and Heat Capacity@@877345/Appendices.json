For a simple compressible system, the First Law of Thermodynamics in differential form is\n$$\n\\mathrm{d}U = \\delta q + \\delta w,\n$$\nwhere $U$ is the internal energy, $\\delta q$ is the increment of heat added to the system, and $\\delta w$ is the increment of work done on the system. For a quasistatic pressure–volume process with only pressure–volume work, $\\delta w = -p\\,\\mathrm{d}V$. The ideal-gas equation of state is\n$$\npV = nRT,\n$$\nwith $n$ the amount of substance and $R$ the universal gas constant.

For a monatomic ideal gas in the classical regime, the equipartition theorem assigns an average energy of $(1/2)k_{B}T$ per quadratic degree of freedom per particle, with $k_{B}$ the Boltzmann constant. A monatomic gas has three translational quadratic degrees of freedom and no rotational or vibrational modes, so the mean internal energy per particle is\n$$\n\\langle \\varepsilon \\rangle = \\frac{3}{2}k_{B}T.\n$$\nFor $n$ moles, the total internal energy is\n$$\nU = N \\langle \\varepsilon \\rangle = nN_{A}\\left(\\frac{3}{2}k_{B}T\\right) = \\frac{3}{2}nRT,\n$$\nwhere $N = nN_{A}$ is the number of particles and $N_{A}k_{B} = R$.

For a steady-flow device with a single inlet and outlet, neglecting changes in kinetic and potential energies and any shaft work other than electrical heating, the steady-flow energy balance may be written as\n$$\n\\dot{Q} - \\dot{W}_{\\text{shaft}} + \\dot{m}\\,h_{\\text{in}} = \\dot{m}\\,h_{\\text{out}},\n$$\nwhere $\\dot{Q}$ is the heat transfer rate to the fluid, $\\dot{W}_{\\text{shaft}}$ is the shaft work rate done by the fluid on the surroundings (zero here except for the electrical input counted as heat to the fluid), $\\dot{m}$ is the mass flow rate, and $h$ is the specific enthalpy.

In calorimetry, this means accounting for the heat capacity of the sample holder, thermometer, and other components, collectively known as the 'addenda'. This practice addresses the critical experimental technique of performing a baseline measurement to determine the addenda's contribution and correctly subtracting it, while also introducing the rigorous methods of uncertainty propagation required to quantify confidence in the final result [@problem_id:2926457].", "problem": "An adiabatic, constant-pressure pulse calorimeter is used to measure the molar isobaric heat capacity of a solid sample at approximately $298 \\ \\mathrm{K}$. A heat pulse of known energy is delivered, and the temperature rise is recorded.

The appropriate way to determine and remove the calorimeter addenda is to perform an addenda-only pulse under the same operating conditions and subtract the addenda heat capacity, obtained from that baseline pulse, from the total heat capacity measured with the sample; the sample’s molar heat capacity is then the sample heat capacity divided by the sample amount.\n\nB. Treating $Q_s$, $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{tot}}$, $Q_a$, $\\Delta T_a$, and $m$ as independent, the combined standard uncertainty in the sample molar isobaric heat capacity $C_p^{\\mathrm{m}}$ is obtained by the law of propagation of uncertainty using partial derivatives of $C_p^{\\mathrm{m}}$ with respect to those quantities; for the given data, one obtains $C_p^{\\mathrm{m}} = 100.0 \\pm 1.31 \\ \\mathrm{J} \\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1} \\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$ (standard uncertainty).\n\nC.

If the addenda heat capacity depends on temperature, any mismatch in the mean temperature between the baseline and sample pulses introduces a bias in the subtraction; minimizing the mismatch or interpolating $C_a(T)$ reduces systematic error that is not captured by the single-run random uncertainty budget.", "solution": "The problem has been validated and found to be scientifically sound, well-posed, and free of contradictions. The data provided are sufficient to determine the molar isobaric heat capacity of the sample and to evaluate the accompanying statements. We shall proceed with the derivation and analysis.\n\nThe fundamental principle of calorimetry at constant pressure for an adiabatic process is that the heat delivered, $Q$, equals the change in enthalpy, which for a small temperature increment $\\Delta T$ is given by $\\Delta H \\approx C_p \\Delta T$. Thus, the total heat capacity $C_p$ of a system is given by $C_p = Q / \\Delta T$.\n\nThis measurement is conducted in two steps.\n\n1.  **Baseline (addenda-only) run**: A heat pulse $Q_a$ is applied to the calorimeter addenda (pan, grease, etc.), resulting in a temperature rise $\\Delta T_a$.

It states that one measures the addenda heat capacity in a baseline run, measures the total heat capacity in a sample run, subtracts the former from the latter to find the sample's heat capacity, and finally divides by the amount of substance to obtain the molar heat capacity. This is a precise verbal description of the mathematical derivation performed above, where $C_p = C_{\\mathrm{tot}} - C_a$ and $C_p^{\\mathrm{m}} = C_p / n$.

The result stated in the option, $C_p^{\\mathrm{m}} = 100.0 \\pm 1.31 \\ \\mathrm{J \\ mol^{-1} \\ K^{-1}}$ (standard uncertainty), is correct.\n\n**Verdict for B: Correct**\n\n**Analysis of Option C**\n\nThis option proposes an alternative formula: $C_p^{\\mathrm{m}} = \\dfrac{Q}{\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{tot}} - \\Delta T_a} \\dfrac{1}{n}$. This formula is fundamentally flawed. It attempts to subtract temperature rises directly, which is invalid. The correct procedure is to subtract heat capacities, as derived earlier. The formula $Q (\\frac{1}{\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{tot}}} - \\frac{1}{\\Delta T_a})$ does not simplify to $\\frac{Q}{\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{tot}} - \\Delta T_a}$. Applying the data gives a nonsensical negative result:\n$\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{tot}} - \\Delta T_a = 1.2500 \\ \\mathrm{K} - 2.0000 \\ \\mathrm{K} = -0.7500 \\ \\mathrm{K}$.\nWith $Q=100.00 \\ \\mathrm{J}$ and $n = 0.3000 \\ \\mathrm{mol}$,\n$C_p^{\\mathrm{m}} = \\frac{100.00 \\ \\mathrm{J}}{-0.7500 \\ \\mathrm{K}} \\frac{1}{0.3000 \\ \\mathrm{mol}} \\approx -444.4 \\ \\mathrm{J \\ mol^{-1} \\ K^{-1}}$.\nA negative heat capacity for a stable substance is a physical absurdity. The claim that this result \"correctly reflects the subtraction of addenda\" is an algebraic and conceptual error of the highest order.\n\n**Verdict for C: Incorrect**\n\n**Analysis of Option D**\n\nThis option claims that the uncertainty in the addenda measurement ($Q_a$, $\\Delta T_a$) does not propagate to the final result because its contribution is subtracted. This is patently false and demonstrates a gross misunderstanding of uncertainty propagation. When two independent quantities are added or subtracted, their variances add. Our explicit calculation in the analysis of option B shows non-zero uncertainty contributions from both $u(Q_a)$ and $u(\\Delta T_a)$: $0.1111$ and $0.1736 \\ (\\mathrm{J \\ mol^{-1} \\ K^{-1}})^2$, respectively. Subtracting a quantity with uncertainty increases the uncertainty of the final result, it does not cancel it.\n\n**Verdict for D: Incorrect**\n\n**Analysis of Option E**\n\nThis option addresses a practical, real-world complication: the temperature dependence of the addenda heat capacity, $C_a(T)$. The problem's simplifying assumption of constant heat capacity applies only *over a single pulse*. However, the two pulses (baseline and sample) occur at different temperature increments, and thus different mean temperatures. The mean temperature of the baseline run's addenda is approximately $T_{start} + \\Delta T_a / 2 = T_{start} + 1.0000 \\ \\mathrm{K}$, while the mean temperature for the addenda during the sample run is $T_{start} + \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{tot}} / 2 = T_{start} + 0.6250 \\ \\mathrm{K}$. If $C_a$ has a non-zero temperature dependence ($dC_a/dT \\neq 0$), then the value $C_a = Q_a/\\Delta T_a$ measured in the baseline run is not the correct value to subtract from the sample run's total heat capacity. This mismatch introduces a systematic error, or bias, which is not captured by the random uncertainty analysis in option B. The proposed methods to mitigate this bias—minimizing the temperature mismatch between runs or measuring $C_a$ as a function of $T$ and interpolating—are standard, correct procedures in high-precision calorimetry. This statement is entirely correct and shows a sophisticated understanding of experimental practice.\n\n**Verdict for E: Correct**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABE}$$", "id": "2926457"}, {"introduction": "Modern thermal analysis techniques, such as Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), provide rich datasets where heat capacity is not a constant but a function of temperature.
