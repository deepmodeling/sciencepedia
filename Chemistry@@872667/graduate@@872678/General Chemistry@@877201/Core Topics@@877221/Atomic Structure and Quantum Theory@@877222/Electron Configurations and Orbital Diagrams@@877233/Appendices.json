Do not round.", "solution": "The problem as stated is well-posed, scientifically grounded, and provides all necessary information for a complete derivation. We shall proceed with the solution.\n\nThe system under consideration is a free atom with three equivalent electrons in a $p$ subshell, a configuration denoted as $p^3$. For each electron in a $p$ subshell, the orbital angular momentum quantum number is $l=1$ and the spin quantum number is $s=\\frac{1}{2}$. The corresponding magnetic quantum numbers are $m_l \\in \\{-1, 0, 1\\}$ and $m_s \\in \\{-\\frac{1}{2}, +\\frac{1}{2}\\}$.\n\nFirst, we determine the total number of possible microstates for the $p^3$ configuration, which must be consistent with the Pauli exclusion principle. A $p$ subshell has $2l+1 = 2(1)+1 = 3$ spatial orbitals. Each orbital can accommodate $2s+1 = 2(\\frac{1}{2})+1 = 2$ electrons with opposite spins. This gives a total of $(2l+1)(2s+1) = 3 \\times 2 = 6$ unique spin-orbitals. The number of ways to place $3$ indistinguishable electrons into these $6$ available spin-orbitals is given by the binomial coefficient:\n$$ N_{\\text{microstates}} = \\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 20 $$\nThe allowed Russell-Saunders (LS) terms must collectively account for these $20$ microstates.\n\nTo derive the terms, we construct a table of all possible microstates, categorized by the total magnetic orbital angular momentum $M_L = \\sum_i m_{l_i}$ and the total magnetic spin angular momentum $M_S = \\sum_i m_{s_i}$. Each microstate is a unique combination of three spin-orbitals that satisfies the Pauli exclusion principle.\n\nThe maximum value of $M_S$ occurs when all three electron spins are parallel (e.g., all spin-up, $m_s=+\\frac{1}{2}$). By the Pauli principle, they must occupy different spatial orbitals. For a $p$ subshell, this means occupying the orbitals with $m_l = +1, 0, -1$. This configuration gives:\n$$ M_S = \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{3}{2} $$\n$$ M_L = 1 + 0 + (-1) = 0 $$\nThe existence of a microstate with $M_S = \\frac{3}{2}$ implies a term with total spin $S=\\frac{3}{2}$. The maximum value of $M_L$ associated with $M_S = \\frac{3}{2}$ is $M_L=0$, which indicates that the total orbital angular momentum for this term is $L=0$. This term is a quartet S term, denoted as $^4S$, where the multiplicity is $2S+1 = 2(\\frac{3}{2})+1 = 4$. This term accounts for $(2L+1)(2S+1) = (2(0)+1)(2(\\frac{3}{2})+1) = 1 \\times 4 = 4$ microstates. These microstates correspond to $(M_L, M_S)$ pairs $(0, \\frac{3}{2}), (0, \\frac{1}{2}), (0, -\\frac{1}{2}),$ and $(0, -\\frac{3}{2})$.\n\nAfter accounting for the $^4S$ term, $20 - 4 = 16$ microstates remain to be assigned. We now seek the maximum value of $M_L$ among the remaining microstates. The maximum possible $M_L$ for a $p^3$ configuration is achieved by placing two electrons in the $m_l=+1$ orbital and one in the $m_l=0$ orbital. By the Pauli principle, the two electrons in the $m_l=+1$ orbital must have opposite spins ($m_s=+\\frac{1}{2}, m_s=-\\frac{1}{2}$). To maximize $M_S$, the third electron (in the $m_l=0$ orbital) must have $m_s=+\\frac{1}{2}$. This configuration gives:\n$$ M_L = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2 $$\n$$ M_S = \\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} $$\nThe existence of this microstate $(M_L, M_S) = (2, \\frac{1}{2})$, which was not part of the $^4S$ term, indicates there must be a term with $L=2$. The maximum $M_S$ value for $L=2$ is $M_S=\\frac{1}{2}$, so the total spin for this term is $S=\\frac{1}{2}$. This identifies a doublet D term, $^2D$, with multiplicity $2S+1=2(\\frac{1}{2})+1=2$. This term accounts for $(2L+1)(2S+1) = (2(2)+1)(2(\\frac{1}{2})+1) = 5 \\times 2 = 10$ microstates.\n\nAfter accounting for the $^4S$ and $^2D$ terms, $20 - 4 - 10 = 6$ microstates remain. These $6$ microstates must form one or more complete LS terms. The number of states in a term is $(2L+1)(2S+1)$. For this product to equal $6$, and considering that $S$ must be a half-integer (for $3$ electrons), the only plausible combination is $L=1$ and $S=\\frac{1}{2}$, which yields $(2(1)+1)(2(\\frac{1}{2})+1) = 3 \\times 2 = 6$ states. This corresponds to a doublet P term, $^2P$.\nThus, the complete set of allowed LS terms for the $p^3$ configuration is $^4S$, $^2D$, and $^2P$. The total number of states is $4 + 10 + 6 = 20$, which matches our initial combinatorial calculation, confirming the set of terms is correct and complete.\n\nNext, we apply Hund's rules to identify the ground term.\n1.  **Hund's First Rule:** The term with the highest spin multiplicity lies lowest in energy.\n    The multiplicities are: $4$ for $^4S$ ($S=\\frac{3}{2}$), $2$ for $^2D$ ($S=\\frac{1}{2}$), and $2$ for $^2P$ ($S=\\frac{1}{2}$).\n    The highest multiplicity is $4$, so the ground term is $^4S$.\n\n2.  **Hund's Second Rule:** For terms with the same multiplicity, the one with the largest value of $L$ is lower in energy. This rule would place the $^2D$ term ($L=2$) lower in energy than the $^2P$ term ($L=1$). The overall energy ordering of the terms is $^4S  ^2D  ^2P$.\n\n3.  **Hund's Third Rule:** For a given term, the energy ordering of its levels (specified by the total angular momentum quantum number $J$) depends on the filling of the subshell. The possible values of $J$ are given by the angular momentum addition rule, $J = |L-S|, |L-S|+1, \\dots, L+S$.\n    -   For a subshell that is less than half-filled, the level with the minimum $J$ is the lowest in energy.\n    -   For a subshell that is more than half-filled, the level with the maximum $J$ is the lowest in energy.\n\nWe must determine the $J$ value for the ground level, which arises from the ground term $^4S$. For the $^4S$ term, we have $L=0$ and $S=\\frac{3}{2}$. Applying the angular momentum addition rule:\n$$ J = |0 - \\frac{3}{2}|, \\dots, 0 + \\frac{3}{2} $$\nThis gives only one possible value for $J$:\n$$ J = \\frac{3}{2} $$\nSince there is only a single level, $^4S_{3/2}$, for the ground term, this must be the ground level. Hund's third rule is trivially satisfied. The $p^3$ configuration corresponds to a half-filled subshell, and for such cases, the ground term determined by Hund's first and second rules yields a state with only one possible total angular momentum $J$.\n\nThe unique ground level is thus $^4S_{3/2}$, and the corresponding value of the total angular momentum quantum number is $J = \\frac{3}{2}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{3}{2}}$$", "id": "2936731"}, {"introduction": "With a firm grasp of term symbol origins, we can now efficiently determine the single most important state: the ground state.

It shall be solved as stated.\n\nFirst, we establish the electron configuration of the neutral iron atom ($\\mathrm{Fe}$), which has an atomic number $Z=26$. According to the Aufbau principle, the ground-state electron configuration is $1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6 4s^2 3d^6$. It is conventional to write this as $[\\mathrm{Ar}] 3d^6 4s^2$, where $[\\mathrm{Ar}]$ represents the core configuration $1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6$.\n\nIonization of a transition metal atom involves the removal of electrons from the orbital with the highest principal quantum number, $n$. For iron, this is the $n=4$ shell, specifically the $4s$ subshell.\n\nTo form the ferrous ion, $\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$, two electrons are removed. Both are removed from the $4s$ subshell.\nThe electron configuration for $\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ is therefore $[\\mathrm{Ar}] 3d^6$.\n\nTo form the ferric ion, $\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$, three electrons are removed. The first two are removed from the $4s$ subshell, and the third is removed from the $3d$ subshell.\nThe electron configuration for $\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ is therefore $[\\mathrm{Ar}] 3d^5$.\n\nNow, we determine the properties of each ion based on its $d$-subshell occupancy.\n\n**Analysis of $\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ ($3d^6$ configuration)**\n\nThe $d$-subshell consists of five degenerate orbitals corresponding to magnetic quantum numbers $m_{\\ell} = -2, -1, 0, +1, +2$. To determine the ground-state arrangement of the six $d$-electrons, we apply Hund's rules.\n\n1.  Hund's First Rule (Rule of Maximum Multiplicity): The ground state is that which has the maximum total spin quantum number, $S$. This is achieved by placing electrons singly into each orbital before any pairing occurs. For a $d^6$ configuration, five electrons are placed with parallel spins (e.g., spin-up, $\\uparrow$) into the five orbitals. The sixth electron must then pair with one of them, having an opposite spin (spin-down, $\\downarrow$). The resulting occupancy pattern is one doubly-occupied orbital and four singly-occupied orbitals.\n    The number of unpaired electrons is therefore $n_{u}(\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}) = 4$.\n    The total spin is the sum of the spin quantum numbers ($m_s = \\pm\\frac{1}{2}$): $S = 4 \\times (\\frac{1}{2}) = 2$.\n\n2.  Hund's Second Rule and LS Ground Term: For a given maximum spin, the ground term is that with the maximum total orbital angular momentum quantum number, $L$. The term is denoted as $^{2S+1}L$.\n    The spin multiplicity is $2S+1 = 2(2)+1 = 5$.\n    Determining $L$ for a more-than-half-filled shell like $d^6$ is simplified by using the principle of electron-hole symmetry, as required by the problem statement. A $d^n$ configuration possesses the same set of LS terms as a $d^{10-n}$ configuration. Thus, the terms for $d^6$ are identical to those for $d^4$.\n    For the simpler $d^4$ case, to maximize $S$, all four electrons are unpaired ($S=2$). To then maximize $L = |\\sum m_{\\ell}|$, these four electrons are placed in the orbitals with the highest available $m_{\\ell}$ values: $m_{\\ell} = +2, +1, 0, -1$. The total orbital angular momentum is $L = (+2) + (+1) + (0) + (-1) = 2$. An $L=2$ state is designated by the letter $D$.\n    Therefore, the ground term for both $d^4$ and $d^6$ is a $^5D$ term.\n\n3.  Hund's Third Rule and Total Angular Momentum ($J$): The ground state level within a term is specified by the total angular momentum quantum number, $J$. For a subshell that is more than half-filled (like $d^6$), the level with the maximum possible value of $J$ is the lowest in energy. The possible values of $J$ are $|L-S|, \\dots, L+S$. With $L=2$ and $S=2$, the values are $J=0, 1, 2, 3, 4$. The maximum value is $J_{max}=4$.\n    The complete ground-state term symbol for $\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ is $^5D_4$.\n\n**Analysis of $\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ ($3d^5$ configuration)**\n\n1.  Hund's First Rule: The $d^5$ configuration corresponds to a half-filled subshell. To maximize spin, one electron is placed in each of the five $d$-orbitals, all with parallel spins.\n    The number of unpaired electrons is $n_{u}(\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}) = 5$.\n    The total spin is $S = 5 \\times (\\frac{1}{2}) = \\frac{5}{2}$.\n\n2.  Hund's Second Rule and LS Ground Term: The spin multiplicity is $2S+1 = 2(\\frac{5}{2})+1 = 6$.\n    To find $L$, we sum the $m_{\\ell}$ values of the occupied orbitals: $L = (+2) + (+1) + (0) + (-1) + (-2) = 0$. An $L=0$ state is designated by the letter $S$.\n    Therefore, the ground term for $\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ is a $^6S$ term.\n\n3.  Hund's Third Rule: For an $S$-term ($L=0$), there is only one possible value for $J$, which is $J=S$. Here, $J=\\frac{5}{2}$.\n    The complete ground-state term symbol for $\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ is $^6S_{5/2}$.\n\n**Final Calculation**\n\nThe problem asks for the value of the composite quantity $X$, defined as $X \\equiv 2\\,n_{u}(\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}) + 3\\,n_{u}(\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+})$.\nFrom our analysis:\n-   Number of unpaired electrons in $\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ is $n_{u}(\\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}) = 4$.\n-   Number of unpaired electrons in $\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ is $n_{u}(\\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}) = 5$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for $X$:\n$$\nX = 2(4) + 3(5) = 8 + 15 = 23\n$$\nThe value of $X$ is determined to be $23$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{23}\n$$", "id": "2936794"}, {"introduction": "The power of Russell-Saunders coupling extends across the periodic table, proving particularly vital for understanding the unique properties of the lanthanides.

The atomic number of neodymium ($\\mathrm{Nd}$) is given as $Z=60$. Following the Aufbau principle, the electron configuration of a neutral neodymium atom is built upon the configuration of the preceding noble gas, xenon ($[\\mathrm{Xe}]$, $Z=54$). The remaining $60 - 54 = 6$ electrons populate the available orbitals. For the lanthanide series, this corresponds to the configuration $[\\mathrm{Xe}] \\ 4f^{4} 6s^{2}$.\n\nTo form the trication $\\mathrm{Nd}^{3+}$, three electrons must be removed from the neutral atom. As specified in the problem statement, and consistent with general principles of ionization, electrons are first removed from the orbitals with the highest principal quantum number, which are the most weakly bound. In this case, the two electrons in the $6s$ orbital are removed first. To achieve a $+3$ charge, a third electron must be removed. Since there are no $5d$ electrons in the neutral $\\mathrm{Nd}$ configuration, this electron must be removed from the $4f$ subshell.\n\nThus, the process is:\n$\\mathrm{Nd} \\ ([\\mathrm{Xe}] \\ 4f^{4} 6s^{2}) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Nd}^{2+} \\ ([\\mathrm{Xe}] \\ 4f^{4}) + 2e^{-} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Nd}^{3+} \\ ([\\mathrm{Xe}] \\ 4f^{3}) + 1e^{-}$.\nThe ground-state electron configuration of the $\\mathrm{Nd}^{3+}$ ion is therefore $[\\mathrm{Xe}] \\ 4f^{3}$. The problem now reduces to analyzing this $4f^{3}$ configuration within the Russell-Saunders ($LS$) coupling scheme.\n\nWe apply Hund's rules to determine the quantum numbers $S$, $L$, and $J$ for the ground-state term symbol.

The $4f$ subshell can accommodate a maximum of $14$ electrons, so a half-filled shell would contain $7$ electrons. Since there are only $3$ electrons, the subshell is less than half-filled.
