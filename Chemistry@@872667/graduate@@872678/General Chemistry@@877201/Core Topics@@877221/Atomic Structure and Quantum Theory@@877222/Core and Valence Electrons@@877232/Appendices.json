Slater’s rules provide an empirically calibrated, internally consistent prescription for estimating $S$ by partitioning electrons into groups relative to the electron of interest and assigning each group a weighting factor that reflects average shielding efficiency arising from electron–electron repulsion and radial distribution (penetration).\n\nFor a phosphorus atom, $Z=15$ and the ground-state configuration is\n$$\n1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}\\,2p^{6}\\,3s^{2}\\,3p^{3}.\n$$\nWe target a single $3p$ electron. According to Slater’s rules for an $n s$ or $n p$ electron:\n- Electrons in the same principal shell $n$ and within $s$ or $p$ subshells contribute a partial screening with a coefficient reflecting their incomplete shielding due to similar radial extent and penetration.\n- Electrons in the shell immediately below ($n-1$) contribute a stronger screening because they are on average closer to the nucleus with higher penetration relative to the target electron.\n- Electrons in shells $n-2$ or lower contribute nearly complete screening because their radial distributions lie predominantly inside the target electron’s radial extent.\n\nImplementing these rules for a $3p$ electron:\n1. Same-group electrons: the group here is $(3s,3p)$. Excluding the electron of interest, there are $2$ electrons in $3s$ and $2$ other electrons in $3p$, totaling $4$ electrons in the same $(3s,3p)$ group. Slater’s rules assign a coefficient of $0.35$ per electron in this group for an $n s$ or $n p$ target electron, reflecting significant but incomplete shielding at comparable radial distance. Thus the same-shell contribution is\n$$\nS_{\\text{same}} = 4 \\times 0.35 = 1.40.\n$$\n\n2. Electrons in the $(n-1)$ shell: for $n=3$, the $(n-1)$ shell is $n=2$, which contains $2s^{2}2p^{6}$, totaling $8$ electrons. For an $n s$ or $n p$ target electron, each $(n-1)$ electron contributes $0.85$ because these electrons have greater penetration and lie, on average, inside the $n=3$ electron’s most probable radius. Therefore,\n$$\nS_{n-1} = 8 \\times 0.85 = 6.80.\n$$\n\n3. Electrons in the $(n-2)$ or lower shells: here $n-2=1$, so the $1s^{2}$ electrons contribute. For an $n s$ or $n p$ target electron, each of these inner-shell electrons contributes effectively $1.00$, representing near-complete screening due to their much smaller average radius:\n$$\nS_{n-2\\text{ or lower}} = 2 \\times 1.00 = 2.00.\n$$\n\nSumming these contributions,\n$$\nS = S_{\\text{same}} + S_{n-1} + S_{n-2\\text{ or lower}} = 1.40 + 6.80 + 2.00 = 10.20.\n$$\nHence,\n$$\nZ_{\\mathrm{eff}} = Z - S = 15 - 10.20 = 4.80.\n$$\nRounding to $3$ significant figures yields $4.80$ (the trailing zero is significant due to the decimal point).\n\nInterpretation regarding valence classification: In main-group elements, valence electrons occupy the outermost principal shell $n$; for phosphorus, electrons in $n=3$ ($3s$ and $3p$) are valence. The computed $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx 4.80$ for a $3p$ electron is substantially smaller than the effective nuclear charge experienced by inner-shell ($n=2$) electrons, which, by the same logic, would be much larger because higher-$n$ electrons do not significantly shield lower-$n$ electrons and the $1s$ and $(2s,2p)$ electrons reside closer to the nucleus. A lower $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ for the $3p$ electron implies weaker net attraction to the nucleus, larger average radial distance, and greater susceptibility to perturbation in bonding environments—hallmarks of valence behavior. Conversely, core electrons experience much larger $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, are tightly bound with smaller radii and substantially less chemical participation. Thus, the magnitude $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx 4.80$ for the $3p$ electron is consistent with its classification as a valence electron in phosphorus, aligning with the outer-shell criterion and the shielding/penetration picture underlying Slater’s rules.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4.80}$$", "id": "2931258"}, {"introduction": "While the core-valence distinction is straightforward for many elements, it becomes more nuanced for transition metals due to the close energy levels of the $(n-1)d$ and $ns$ orbitals.

The $3d^{10}$ electrons can be safely treated as core across the halides; $Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}(3d)  Z_{\\mathrm{eff}}(4p)$ implies the $3d$ shell is more diffuse and directly participates in bonding. Including $3d$ in the valence would spuriously shorten all $\\text{Ga–X}$ bonds relative to experiment.\n\nB.

However, they are not as deeply buried as true core electrons (like $n=1, 2$). This intermediate nature qualifies them as **semicore** electrons.\n\nIn chemical bonding, this semicore $3d^{10}$ shell is polarizable. It can be distorted by the electric field of the bonding partner (the halide), and it engages in core-valence electron correlation (dispersion forces). These are attractive interactions. A computational model that \"freezes\" the $3d^{10}$ electrons (treats them as inert core) neglects these attractive forces.
