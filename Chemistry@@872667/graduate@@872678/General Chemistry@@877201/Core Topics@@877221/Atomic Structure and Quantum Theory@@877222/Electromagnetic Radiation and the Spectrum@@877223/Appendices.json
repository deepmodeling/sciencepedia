Substituting this into the energy expression gives the energy of a single photon in terms of its wavelength:\n$$E_{\\text{ph}} = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$$\nPower, $P$, is defined as the total energy transferred per unit time. The LASER beam is monochromatic, so all photons possess the same energy, $E_{\\text{ph}}$. The total energy, $E_{\\text{total}}$, delivered by $N_{\\text{ph}}$ photons is $E_{\\text{total}} = N_{\\text{ph}} E_{\\text{ph}}$. The power is then the rate at which this energy is delivered:\n$$P = \\frac{dE_{\\text{total}}}{dt} = \\frac{d(N_{\\text{ph}} E_{\\text{ph}})}{dt}$$\nSince $E_{\\text{ph}}$ is constant for a monochromatic beam, we have:\n$$P = E_{\\text{ph}} \\frac{dN_{\\text{ph}}}{dt}$$\nThe problem defines the photon flux, $\\Phi$, as the number of photons incident per unit time, which is precisely the term $\\frac{dN_{\\text{ph}}}{dt}$.\n$$\\Phi = \\frac{dN_{\\text{ph}}}{dt}$$\nSubstituting this definition into the power equation yields:\n$$P = \\Phi E_{\\text{ph}}$$\nWe can now solve for the photon flux $\\Phi$:\n$$\\Phi = \\frac{P}{E_{\\text{ph}}}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $E_{\\text{ph}} = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$, we obtain the final expression for the photon flux:\n$$\\Phi = \\frac{P}{\\frac{hc}{\\lambda}} = \\frac{P\\lambda}{hc}$$\n\nNext, we derive the expression for the radiation pressure, $p_{\\text{rad}}$.\nThe momentum of a single photon, $p_{\\text{ph}}$, is related to its wavelength $\\lambda$ by the de Broglie relation:\n$$p_{\\text{ph}} = \\frac{h}{\\lambda}$$\nAlternatively, using $E_{\\text{ph}} = hc/\\lambda$, we can write the photon momentum in terms of its energy: $p_{\\text{ph}} = E_{\\text{ph}}/c$.\nPressure is defined as force per unit area, $p_{\\text{rad}} = \\frac{F}{A}$. According to Newton's second law, force is the rate of change of momentum, $F = \\frac{dp_{\\text{total}}}{dt}$. Therefore, pressure is the flux of momentum per unit area:\n$$p_{\\text{rad}} = \\frac{1}{A} \\frac{dp_{\\text{total}}}{dt}$$\nThe problem states that the beam is incident normally on a perfectly absorbing surface.
