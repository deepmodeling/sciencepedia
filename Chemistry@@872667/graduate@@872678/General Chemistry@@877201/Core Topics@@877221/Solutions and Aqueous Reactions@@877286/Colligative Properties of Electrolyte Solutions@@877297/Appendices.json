We shall proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe fundamental principle governing freezing point depression is the equality of the chemical potential of the solvent in the liquid phase and in the solid phase at the new freezing temperature, $T_f$. For a dilute solution, this relationship simplifies to a direct proportionality between the freezing point depression, $\\Delta T_f$, and the total molality of all non-volatile solute species, $m_{total}$. This is expressed by the equation:\n$$\n\\Delta T_f = K_f m_{total}\n$$\nwhere $K_f$ is the cryoscopic constant of the solvent. Our task is to determine $m_{total}$ based on the speciation of the electrolyte $\\mathrm{MX}$ at a given formal molality $m_0$.\n\nThe species present in the solution are the free ions $\\mathrm{M^{2+}}$ and $\\mathrm{X^{2-}}$, and the neutral ion pair $\\mathrm{MX^{0}}$.

To maintain bulk electroneutrality, the molality of cations must equal the molality of anions.\n    $$\n    m_{\\mathrm{M^{2+}}} = m_{\\mathrm{X^{2-}}}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Mass Balance**: The total formal molality, $m_0$, represents the total amount of the $\\mathrm{MX}$ substance added to the solution, irrespective of its form (ionic or paired). This total amount is distributed between the free ions (quantified by $m_{\\mathrm{M^{2+}}}$) and the ion pairs (quantified by $m_{\\mathrm{MX^{0}}}$).

Substituting the expression for $\\Delta G_{\\mathrm{fus}}^{*}(T'_{\\mathrm{f}})$ from the equilibrium condition:\n$$\n\\frac{-RT'_{\\mathrm{f}} \\ln a_{\\mathrm{w}}}{T'_{\\mathrm{f}}} = -R \\ln a_{\\mathrm{w}} = -\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fus}}^{*} \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{f}}}{T_{\\mathrm{f}}T'_{\\mathrm{f}}}\n$$\nwhich simplifies to a direct relationship between solvent activity and freezing point depression. For a small depression, we approximate $T'_{\\mathrm{f}} \\approx T_{\\mathrm{f}}$ and use $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fus}}$ for $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fus}}^{*}$:\n$$\nR \\ln a_{\\mathrm{w}} \\approx -\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fus}} \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{f}}}{T_{\\mathrm{f}}^2}\n$$\nThe activity of the solvent, $a_{\\mathrm{w}}$, is related to the practical osmotic coefficient, $\\phi$, by the definition:\n$$\n\\ln a_{\\mathrm{w}} = - M_{\\mathrm{w}} \\sum_{s} \\nu_{s} m_{s} \\phi = - M_{\\mathrm{w}} m_{\\phi} \\phi\n$$\nwhere $M_{\\mathrm{w}}$ is the molar mass of water (in $\\mathrm{kg\\ mol^{-1}}$) and $m_{\\phi} = \\sum_{s} \\nu_{s} m_{s}$ is the total stoichiometric molality of ions. For the given mixture, $m_{\\phi} = 2m_{1} + 3m_{2}$.\nSubstituting this into the previous equation yields:\n$$\nR (-M_{\\mathrm{w}} m_{\\phi} \\phi) = -\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fus}} \\Delta T_{\\mathrm{f}}}{T_{\\mathrm{f}}^2}\n$$\nSolving for $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{f}}$ gives:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{f}} = \\frac{R T_{\\mathrm{f}}^2 M_{\\mathrm{w}}}{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fus}}} m_{\\phi} \\phi\n$$\nThe problem provides an expression for $m_{\\phi}(\\phi-1)$. We can write $m_{\\phi}\\phi = m_{\\phi} + m_{\\phi}(\\phi-1)$. Using the provided model:\n$$\nm_{\\phi}\\phi = m_{\\phi} - A_{\\phi}\\, I^{3/2} + 2\\,m_{\\mathrm{Na}} m_{\\mathrm{Cl}}\\, \\beta^{(0)}_{\\mathrm{NaCl}} + 2\\, m_{\\mathrm{Mg}} m_{\\mathrm{Cl}}\\, \\beta^{(0)}_{\\mathrm{MgCl_{2}}} + m_{\\mathrm{Na}} m_{\\mathrm{Cl}}\\, C^{\\phi}_{\\mathrm{NaCl}} + m_{\\mathrm{Mg}} m_{\\mathrm{Cl}}\\, C^{\\phi}_{\\mathrm{MgCl_{2}}} + m_{\\mathrm{Na}} m_{\\mathrm{Mg}}\\, \\theta_{\\mathrm{Na,Mg}} + m_{\\mathrm{Na}} m_{\\mathrm{Mg}} m_{\\mathrm{Cl}}\\, \\psi_{\\mathrm{Na,Mg,Cl}}\n$$\nTo obtain the final expression, we must express all molality terms and the ionic strength $I$ in terms of the given solute molalities $m_{1}$ and $m_{2}$.\nThe ionic molalities are given as $m_{\\mathrm{Na}} = m_{1}$, $m_{\\mathrm{Mg}} = m_{2}$, and $m_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = m_{1} + 2 m_{2}$. The total stoichiometric molality is $m_{\\phi} = 2m_1 + 3m_2$.\nThe ionic strength $I$ is calculated as:\n$$\nI = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i} m_{i} z_{i}^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ m_{\\mathrm{Na}}z_{\\mathrm{Na}}^2 + m_{\\mathrm{Mg}}z_{\\mathrm{Mg}}^2 + m_{\\mathrm{Cl}}z_{\\mathrm{Cl}}^2 \\right]\n$$\nWith $z_{\\mathrm{Na}}=+1$, $z_{\\mathrm{Mg}}=+2$, and $z_{\\mathrm{Cl}}=-1$:\n$$\nI = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ m_{1}(1)^2 + m_{2}(2)^2 + (m_{1} + 2m_{2})(-1)^2 \\right] = \\frac{1}{2} [m_{1} + 4m_{2} + m_{1} + 2m_{2}] = \\frac{1}{2} [2m_{1} + 6m_{2}] = m_{1} + 3m_{2}\n$$\nNow, substitute these expressions back into the equation for $m_{\\phi}\\phi$:\nThe ionic products are:\n$m_{\\mathrm{Na}} m_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = m_{1}(m_{1} + 2m_{2})$\n$m_{\\mathrm{Mg}} m_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = m_{2}(m_{1} + 2m_{2})$\n$m_{\\mathrm{Na}} m_{\\mathrm{Mg}} = m_{1}m_{2}$\n$m_{\\mathrm{Na}} m_{\\mathrm{Mg}} m_{\\mathrm{Cl}} = m_{1}m_{2}(m_{1} + 2m_{2})$\n\nAssembling the full expression for $m_{\\phi}\\phi$:\n$$\nm_{\\phi}\\phi = (2m_{1} + 3m_{2}) - A_{\\phi}(m_{1} + 3m_{2})^{3/2} + 2m_{1}(m_{1} + 2m_{2})\\beta^{(0)}_{\\mathrm{NaCl}} + 2m_{2}(m_{1} + 2m_{2})\\beta^{(0)}_{\\mathrm{MgCl_{2}}} + m_{1}(m_{1} + 2m_{2})C^{\\phi}_{\\mathrm{NaCl}} + m_{2}(m_{1} + 2m_{2})C^{\\phi}_{\\mathrm{MgCl_{2}}} + m_{1}m_{2}\\theta_{\\mathrm{Na,Mg}} + m_{1}m_{2}(m_{1} + 2m_{2})\\psi_{\\mathrm{Na,Mg,Cl}}\n$$\nFinally, substituting this into the equation for $\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{f}}$ yields the closed-form analytic expression. The terms involving $\\theta_{\\mathrm{Na,Mg}}$ and $\\psi_{\\mathrm{Na,Mg,Cl}}$ are the Pitzer cross-interaction parameters, which account for the specific interactions between unlike cations ($\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$) and between two unlike cations and an anion, respectively. These terms represent the deviation from a simple additive mixing rule for the two salt solutions.\n\nThe full expression for the freezing point depression is:\n$$\n\\Delta T_{\\mathrm{f}} = \\frac{R T_{\\mathrm{f}}^2 M_{\\mathrm{w}}}{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fus}}} \\left[ m_{\\phi}\\phi \\right]\n$$\nwhere the term in brackets is the full expression derived above.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{R T_{\\mathrm{f}}^2 M_{\\mathrm{w}}}{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{fus}}} \\left[ (2m_{1} + 3m_{2}) - A_{\\phi}(m_{1} + 3m_{2})^{\\frac{3}{2}} + 2m_{1}(m_{1} + 2m_{2})\\beta^{(0)}_{\\mathrm{NaCl}} + 2m_{2}(m_{1} + 2m_{2})\\beta^{(0)}_{\\mathrm{MgCl_{2}}} + m_{1}(m_{1} + 2m_{2})C^{\\phi}_{\\mathrm{NaCl}} + m_{2}(m_{1} + 2m_{2})C^{\\phi}_{\\mathrm{MgCl_{2}}} + m_{1}m_{2}\\theta_{\\mathrm{Na,Mg}} + m_{1}m_{2}(m_{1} + 2m_{2})\\psi_{\\mathrm{Na,Mg,Cl}} \\right]}\n$$", "id": "2928760"}]}
