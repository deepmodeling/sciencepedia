This approach seamlessly handles the coupling in a single outer iteration on $T$, without requiring an inner fixed-point loop for $\\gamma_i$.\n- If the temperature dependence of $\\gamma_i$ were very strong, one could introduce a nested iteration to converge $\\gamma_i$ for a given $T$ to internal self-consistency, but in the present model $\\gamma_i$ is an explicit function of $T$ and $x$, so an outer root solve on $T$ suffices.\n\nAlgorithmic implementation:\n1. For a given case with specified $p$ and $x$, define $F(T)$ using the Antoine model for $p_i^{\\ast}(T)$ and the Margules model for $\\gamma_i(T,x)$.\n2. Choose a physically reasonable bracket $[T_{\\min}, T_{\\max}]$ such that $F(T_{\\min})  0$ and $F(T_{\\max})  0$. Given that $p_i^{\\ast}(T)$ increases rapidly with $T$, a broad bracket such as $[250 \\, \\mathrm{K}, 600 \\, \\mathrm{K}]$ suffices for the provided systems.\n3. Use a robust bracketing method (for example, Brent's method) to solve $F(T) = 0$ to the desired tolerance.\n4. Report $T_{\\mathrm{bubble}}$ in kelvin rounded to two decimal places.\n\nTest-suite coverage rationale:\n- Case $1$ is a typical binary mixture with mild nonideality, demonstrating the general computation at $p = 101325 \\, \\mathrm{Pa}$ and an intermediate composition.\n- Case $2$ probes the boundary near a pure component where the bubble point approaches the normal boiling temperature of benzene and tests numerical stability for $x_1 \\to 1$.\n- Case $3$ emphasizes strong nonideality with temperature-dependent Margules parameters, illustrating the explicit coupling between $T$ and $\\gamma_i(T,x)$.\n- Case $4$ changes the total pressure to $p = 50000 \\, \\mathrm{Pa}$ for the same nonideal system, highlighting sensitivity to $p$ and ensuring robust bracketing when the bubble point shifts to lower $T$.\n\nThe final program implements these steps for the four cases, ensuring unit consistency (pascals for pressure, kelvin for temperature) and outputs a single line with the four bubble-point temperatures rounded to two decimal places.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.optimize import brentq\n\n# Antoine parameters dictionary: values for log10(p_mmHg) = A - B/(T_C + C), T_C in degC\nANTOINE = {\n    \"benzene\": {\"A\": 6.90565, \"B\": 1211.033, \"C\": 220.790},\n    \"toluene\": {\"A\": 6.95464, \"B\": 1344.800, \"C\": 219.480},\n    \"acetone\": {\"A\": 7.02447, \"B\": 1161.000, \"C\": 224.000},\n    \"chloroform\": {\"A\": 6.95465, \"B\": 1170.966, \"C\": 226.232},\n}\n\nMMHG_TO_PA = 133.322368\n\ndef antoine_p_sat_Pa(T_K: float, A: float, B: float, C: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Saturation vapor pressure in Pa via Antoine equation.\n    T_K: temperature in Kelvin\n    A, B, C: Antoine constants for log10(p_mmHg) = A - B/(T_C + C), T_C in degC.\n    \"\"\"\n    T_C = T_K - 273.15\n    log10_p_mmHg = A - B / (T_C + C)\n    p_mmHg = 10.0 ** log10_p_mmHg\n    return p_mmHg * MMHG_TO_PA\n\ndef margules_gamma_binary(T_K: float, x1: float, a12: float, b12: float, a21: float, b21: float):\n    \"\"\"\n    Three-suffix Margules with temperature dependence:\n    A12(T) = a12 + b12/T\n    A21(T) = a21 + b21/T\n    ln(gamma1) = x2^2 [ A12 + 2 (A21 - A12) x1 ]\n    ln(gamma2) = x1^2 [ A21 + 2 (A12 - A21) x2 ]\n    \"\"\"\n    x2 = 1.0 - x1\n    A12_T = a12 + b12 / T_K\n    A21_T = a21 + b21 / T_K\n    ln_gamma1 = x2**2 * (A12_T + 2.0 * (A21_T - A12_T) * x1)\n    ln_gamma2 = x1**2 * (A21_T + 2.0 * (A12_T - A21_T) * x2)\n    return np.exp(ln_gamma1), np.exp(ln_gamma2)\n\ndef bubble_point_temperature_binary(p_total: float,\n                                    x1: float,\n                                    comp1: dict,\n                                    comp2: dict,\n                                    margules_params: dict,\n                                    T_bounds=(250.0, 600.0)) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Solve for bubble-point temperature T (K) of a binary mixture using modified Raoult's law with Margules gammas.\n    \"\"\"\n    A1, B1, C1 = comp1[\"A\"], comp1[\"B\"], comp1[\"C\"]\n    A2, B2, C2 = comp2[\"A\"], comp2[\"B\"], comp2[\"C\"]\n    a12 = margules_params[\"a12\"]\n    b12 = margules_params[\"b12\"]\n    a21 = margules_params[\"a21\"]\n    b21 = margules_params[\"b21\"]\n\n    def F(T):\n        p1sat = antoine_p_sat_Pa(T, A1, B1, C1)\n        p2sat = antoine_p_sat_Pa(T, A2, B2, C2)\n        g1, g2 = margules_gamma_binary(T, x1, a12, b12, a21, b21)\n        x2 = 1.0 - x1\n        return x1 * g1 * p1sat + x2 * g2 * p2sat - p_total\n\n    # Ensure we have a valid bracket;
