Use the concentration-based form of Henry’s law, in which the dissolved concentration $c$ of the gas in the liquid is proportional to its gas-phase partial pressure $p$ through a proportionality constant $k_{H}^{c}$ that depends on the solvent and temperature.

This is to be accomplished starting from two fundamental relations: Henry's law and the Setschenow equation.\n\nFirst, we state Henry's law in its concentration-based form, as specified in the problem. For a gas dissolving in a liquid, its equilibrium concentration in the solution, $c$, is directly proportional to its partial pressure, $p$, in the gas phase above the liquid:\n$$c = k_{H}^{c} p$$\nHere, $k_{H}^{c}$ is the concentration-based Henry's law constant, which depends on the specific gas, solvent, and temperature. We can write this relation for our two solvents, fresh water (fw) and seawater (sw), at a constant partial pressure $p$ of oxygen:\n$$c_{\\text{fw}} = k_{H, \\text{fw}}^{c} p$$\n$$c_{\\text{sw}} = k_{H, \\text{sw}}^{c} p$$\n\nSecond, we state the empirical Setschenow relation, which quantifies the \"salting-out\" effect, i.e., the reduction in the solubility of a nonelectrolyte gas in the presence of an electrolyte. The standard form of this relation is:\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{S_0}{S}\\right) = k_s c_{\\text{salt}}$$\nIn this equation, $S_0$ is the solubility of the gas in the pure solvent (fresh water), $S$ is the solubility of the gas in the electrolyte solution (seawater), $c_{\\text{salt}}$ is the molar concentration of the salt, and $k_s$ is the Setschenow constant.\n\nThe solubility of a gas is defined as its equilibrium concentration in the solvent under specified conditions. For a given partial pressure $p$, the solubility is simply the concentration $c$. Therefore, we can make the following substitutions:\n$$S_0 = c_{\\text{fw}}$$\n$$S = c_{\\text{sw}}$$\n\nSubstituting these definitions of solubility into the Setschenow equation, we obtain a relation between the concentrations of dissolved oxygen in fresh water and seawater:\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{c_{\\text{fw}}}{c_{\\text{sw}}}\\right) = k_s c_{\\text{salt}}$$\n\nNow, we can substitute the expressions from Henry's law for $c_{\\text{fw}}$ and $c_{\\text{sw}}$ into this equation:\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{k_{H, \\text{fw}}^{c} p}{k_{H, \\text{sw}}^{c} p}\\right) = k_s c_{\\text{salt}}$$\nThe partial pressure $p$ is a common factor in the numerator and denominator, so it cancels out. This is a crucial step, as the Henry's constants themselves must be independent of pressure. The relation simplifies to:\n$$\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{k_{H, \\text{fw}}^{c}}{k_{H, \\text{sw}}^{c}}\\right) = k_s c_{\\text{salt}}$$\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio $R = \\frac{k_{H, \\text{sw}}^{c}}{k_{H, \\text{fw}}^{c}}$. The expression we have derived is for the logarithm of the inverse of $R$. We must solve for $R$. First, we take the antilogarithm (base $10$) of both sides:\n$$\\frac{k_{H, \\text{fw}}^{c}}{k_{H, \\text{sw}}^{c}} = 10^{k_s c_{\\text{salt}}}$$\nInverting this expression gives the desired ratio $R$:\n$$R = \\frac{k_{H, \\text{sw}}^{c}}{k_{H, \\text{fw}}^{c}} = \\left(10^{k_s c_{\\text{salt}}}\\right)^{-1} = 10^{-k_s c_{\\text{salt}}}$$\nThis is the derived analytical expression for the ratio $R$.\n\nNow, we proceed to the numerical evaluation using the provided data:\nThe Setschenow constant is given as $k_s = 0.12\\ \\mathrm{L\\ mol^{-1}}$.\nThe effective salt concentration of seawater is given as $c_{\\text{salt}} = 0.60\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ L^{-1}}$.\n\nWe calculate the exponent first. The units are consistent and cancel out, leaving a dimensionless exponent, as required:\n$$-k_s c_{\\text{salt}} = -(0.12\\ \\mathrm{L\\ mol^{-1}}) \\times (0.60\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ L^{-1}}) = -0.072$$\nSubstituting this value into our expression for $R$:\n$$R = 10^{-0.072}$$\nEvaluating this expression numerically:\n$$R \\approx 0.84723108...$$\nThe problem demands that the final result be rounded to four significant figures.

Select all that apply.", "solution": "The problem requires an evaluation of six scenarios describing potential deviations from ideal gas solubility, as described by Henry's Law. The fundamental starting point is the criterion for phase equilibrium between a gas and a liquid: the chemical potential of the solute species $A$, $\\mu_A$, must be equal in both phases.\n\n$$ \\mu_A^{(g)}(T, P, y_A) = \\mu_A^{(l)}(T, P, x_A) $$\n\nIn the most general case for a non-reacting solute, this equality can be expressed as:\n$$ f_A = K_H(T, P_{ref}) \\cdot \\gamma_A \\cdot x_A \\cdot \\exp\\left(\\frac{\\bar{V}_A^{\\infty(l)}(P - P_{ref})}{RT}\\right) $$\n\nHere, $f_A$ is the fugacity of $A$ in the gas phase ($f_A = \\phi_A y_A P$, where $\\phi_A$ is the fugacity coefficient), $x_A$ is the mole fraction of $A$ in the liquid, $\\gamma_A$ is the activity coefficient of $A$ in the liquid (on a Henry's Law basis, where $\\gamma_A \\to 1$ as $x_A \\to 0$), $K_H(T, P_{ref})$ is the Henry's law constant at a reference pressure $P_{ref}$, and the exponential term is the Poynting correction, which accounts for the effect of total pressure $P$ on the liquid phase chemical potential, with $\\bar{V}_A^{\\infty(l)}$ being the partial molar volume of $A$ at infinite dilution.\n\nThe simplest form of Henry's Law, a direct proportionality between partial pressure $p_A = y_A P$ and mole fraction $x_A$, i.e., $p_A = K_H x_A$, is valid only under the following ideal conditions:\n1.  The gas phase is an ideal gas mixture ($\\phi_A = 1$, so $f_A = p_A$).\n2.  The solution is an ideal dilute solution ($\\gamma_A = 1$).\n3.  The effect of pressure on the liquid phase is negligible (Poynting correction is unity).\n4.  The solute does not undergo chemical reaction in the solvent.\n\nDeviations from this proportionality arise when one or more of these conditions are not met. We will now evaluate each scenario against these principles.\n\n**Scenario A Analysis**\nThe conditions specified are low total pressure ($P \\leq 5\\ \\text{bar}$), low gas-phase mole fraction ($y_A \\leq 0.05$), and extremely low liquid-phase mole fraction ($x_A \\leq 10^{-5}$). Under these conditions, the gas phase is expected to behave ideally ($f_A \\approx p_A$), the liquid phase is in the ideal dilute regime ($\\gamma_A \\approx 1$), and the Poynting correction is negligible. Therefore, no significant deviation from thermodynamic proportionality ($x_A \\propto p_A$) is expected. The proposed diagnostic attributes any observed curvature to \"interfacial mass-transfer resistance.\" This is a fundamental error in logic. Mass-transfer resistance is a kinetic phenomenon that governs the *rate* of approach to equilibrium. It does not alter the *state* of equilibrium itself. A plot of $x_A$ versus $p_A$ represents the equilibrium solubility relationship. Attributing a feature of an equilibrium curve to a kinetic limitation is scientifically unsound.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**Scenario B Analysis**\nThe conditions are a large increase in pressure from $1\\ \\text{bar}$ to $100\\ \\text{bar}$ at a substantial gas-phase mole fraction ($y_A \\approx 0.1$). High pressure causes two significant deviations from ideality. First, the gas phase becomes non-ideal, meaning the fugacity coefficient $\\phi_A$ deviates from $1$, and thus fugacity $f_A$ is not equal to partial pressure $p_A$. Typically, for gases under these conditions, $\\phi_A  1$, leading to $f_A  p_A$. Second, the Poynting correction term, $\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\bar{V}_A^{\\infty(l)}(P - P_{ref})}{RT}\\right)$, becomes significant. As $P$ increases, this term increases, which means the right side of the equilibrium equation increases for a given $x_A$. Re-arranged for $x_A$, we have $x_A \\propto f_A / \\exp(\\dots)$. The effect of the Poynting term is to reduce the solubility $x_A$ at a given $f_A$ as P increases. Both effects (fugacity and Poynting) cause $x_A$ to increase less than linearly with $p_A$, resulting in a plot of $x_A$ versus $p_A$ that is concave downward, as correctly stated in the diagnostic. The diagnostic proposes that plotting $x_A$ versus $f_A$ removes this curvature. This is an oversimplification; such a plot would remove the nonlinearity due to gas-phase non-ideality but would still be curved due to the Poynting effect's dependence on pressure. However, identifying high pressure as the cause of deviation, predicting the correct shape of the curvature, and proposing the use of fugacity as the appropriate diagnostic variable are all fundamentally sound. This represents the correct first step in analyzing high-pressure solubility data.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Scenario C Analysis**\nThe conditions involve a hydrogen-bonding solvent and solute concentrations up to $x_A \\approx 10^{-3}$. The pressure is low, so gas-phase and Poynting effects are negligible ($f_A \\approx p_A$). The key feature is the nature of the solvent and the solute concentration, which is significantly higher than in the ideal dilute regime considered in scenario A. In a strongly interacting (hydrogen-bonding) solvent, solute-solute or specific solute-solvent interactions can lead to a concentration-dependent activity coefficient ($\\gamma_A \\neq 1$) even at these \"dilute\" concentrations. A non-constant $\\gamma_A$ will cause the relationship between $x_A$ and $f_A$ (or $p_A$) to be nonlinear. The diagnostic suggests this nonlinearity persists when plotting $x_A$ versus $f_A$, which correctly points to liquid-phase non-ideality as the cause. Furthermore, it proposes independent verification of a concentration-dependent $\\gamma_A$ using established experimental techniques like osmometry or calorimetry. This scenario correctly identifies a valid source of deviation from Henry's Law and pairs it with a perfectly appropriate and rigorous diagnostic procedure.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Scenario D Analysis**\nThe solute $A$ is described as a weak acid gas in a buffered aqueous solution. This situation introduces the possibility of chemical reaction in the liquid phase. The physical dissolution of the molecular species, $A(g) \\rightleftharpoons A(aq)$, would follow Henry's Law, meaning the concentration of the unreacted species $[A(aq)]$ is proportional to $f_A$. However, the weak acid can then dissociate: $A(aq) + H_2O \\rightleftharpoons H_3O^+ + A^-(aq)$. The total measured \"apparent solubility\" is the sum of all species derived from $A$: $C_{A,total} = [A(aq)] + [A^-(aq)]$. The extent of dissociation depends on the concentration of $H_3O^+$, which is controlled by the buffer's pH. The relationship is $C_{A,total} = [A(aq)](1 + K_a/[H_3O^+])$, where $K_a$ is the acid dissociation constant. This shows that at a fixed fugacity $f_A$ (which fixes $[A(aq)]$), the total solubility $C_{A,total}$ is a function of pH. This matches the first part of the diagnostic. The second part, detecting product species ($A^-$) in the liquid using spectroscopy (IR, NMR), is a direct and definitive method for confirming that a chemical transformation has occurred. This scenario correctly identifies chemical reaction as a cause for deviation from simple physical solubility and proposes valid and powerful diagnostics.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Scenario E Analysis**\nThe conditions describe a nonpolar solute in an aqueous electrolyte solution of varying ionic strength $I$. This is the classic setup for observing the \"salting-out\" effect. The addition of an indifferent electrolyte increases the activity coefficient $\\gamma_A$ of a nonpolar solute, making it less soluble. The equilibrium is $x_A = f_A / (K_H \\gamma_A)$. At fixed $T$ and $f_A$, an increase in $I$ leads to an increase in $\\gamma_A$, and therefore a decrease in solubility $x_A$. This prediction matches the first part of the diagnostic. The second part states that a semilogarithmic plot of apparent solubility versus $I$ is approximately linear. This refers to the well-established empirical Sechenov equation, $\\log(S_0/S) = k_S I$, where $S$ is solubility. This is equivalent to stating that $\\log(S)$ is a linear function of $I$. This is the standard method for correlating and diagnosing the salting-out effect. The scenario provides a textbook example of this phenomenon and its correct diagnostic.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**Scenario F Analysis**\nThe conditions are chosen to enforce ideality ($x_A \\leq 10^{-5}$, ideal solvent, low pressure) at any given temperature. At $T_1$, one expects $x_A = p_A / K_H(T_1)$, a straight line. At $T_2$, one expects $x_A = p_A / K_H(T_2)$, also a straight line. The Henry's constant $K_H$ is fundamentally a function of temperature, as described by the van 't Hoff equation. Therefore, it is expected that $K_H(T_1) \\neq K_H(T_2)$, and thus the slopes of the two lines will be different. The diagnostic claims that this change in slope between temperatures indicates a \"breakdown of proportionality at each temperature.\" This reasoning is fallacious. Proportionality holds at each fixed temperature. The change of the proportionality *constant* with temperature is an integral part of Henry's Law, not a violation of it. This diagnostic misinterprets a fundamental temperature dependence as a failure of the law itself.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BCDE}$$", "id": "2939742"}]}
