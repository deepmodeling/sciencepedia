The specified products, manganese dioxide and molecular iodine, are characteristic of this reaction in neutral or mildly acidic/basic conditions. The principles for balancing the reaction are standard and fundamental to chemistry. The constraint on the stability of iodine in basic solution is a necessary specification to ensure a well-posed problem, as different products can form under more extreme conditions. The problem is chemically sound, self-contained, and non-contradictory. It does not violate any principles of scientific grounding, objectivity, or logical consistency.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. We proceed to its solution.\n\nThe task is to derive the balanced net ionic equation for the given redox process using the method of half-reactions.\n\n**1. Identify Half-Reactions**\nThe oxidation state of manganese in permanganate, $\\ce{MnO4^-}$, is $+7$. In manganese dioxide, $\\ce{MnO2}$, it is $+4$. This is a reduction.\nThe oxidation state of iodine in iodide, $\\ce{I^-}$, is $-1$. In molecular iodine, $\\ce{I2}$, it is $0$. This is an oxidation.\n\nReduction half-reaction: $\\ce{MnO4^- - MnO2(s)}$\nOxidation half-reaction: $\\ce{I^- - I2}$\n\n**2. Balance the Oxidation Half-Reaction**\nFirst, we balance the iodide atoms:\n$$2\\ce{I^-} \\rightarrow \\ce{I2}$$\nNext, we balance the charge by adding electrons. The left side has a charge of $2 \\times (-1) = -2$, and the right side has a charge of $0$. We add $2$ electrons to the right side:\n$$2\\ce{I^-} \\rightarrow \\ce{I2} + 2e^-$$\nThis half-reaction is now balanced for mass and charge.\n\n**3. Balance the Reduction Half-Reaction**\nThe reaction occurs in neutral water. We can balance oxygen by adding $\\ce{H2O}$ and hydrogen by adding $\\ce{H^+}$, and then convert to the final form, or we can balance directly for neutral/basic conditions. Let us use the latter, more direct, method.\nThe unbalanced skeletal reaction is:\n$$\\ce{MnO4^-} \\rightarrow \\ce{MnO2(s)}$$\nThe manganese atoms are balanced. To balance the $4$ oxygen atoms on the left versus the $2$ on the right, we must add $2$ oxygen atoms to the right. In neutral or basic solution, we do this by adding twice as many $\\ce{OH^-}$ ions to the right and half that number of $\\ce{H2O}$ molecules to the left. We require $2$ more oxygen atoms on the right, so we add $4\\ce{OH^-}$ to the right and $2\\ce{H2O}$ to the left.\n$$\\ce{MnO4^-} + 2\\ce{H2O} \\rightarrow \\ce{MnO2(s)} + 4\\ce{OH^-}$$\nNow we check the hydrogen balance. There are $4$ hydrogens on the left and $4$ on the right. The atoms are balanced. Finally, we balance the charge. The left side has a charge of $-1$. The right side has a charge of $4 \\times (-1) = -4$. We must add $3$ electrons to the left side:\n$$\\ce{MnO4^-} + 2\\ce{H2O} + 3e^- \\rightarrow \\ce{MnO2(s)} + 4\\ce{OH^-}$$\nThis half-reaction is now balanced. This form is valid for reactions starting in neutral water (where consuming $\\ce{H^+}$ from water autoionization produces $\\ce{OH^-}$) and for reactions in basic solution.\n\n**4. Combine the Half-Reactions**\nWe must equate the number of electrons transferred.\nOxidation: $2\\ce{I^-} \\rightarrow \\ce{I2} + 2e^-$\nReduction: $\\ce{MnO4^-} + 2\\ce{H2O} + 3e^- \\rightarrow \\ce{MnO2(s)} + 4\\ce{OH^-}$\n\nThe least common multiple of $2$ and $3$ electrons is $6$. We multiply the oxidation half-reaction by $3$ and the reduction half-reaction by $2$:\n$$3 \\times (2\\ce{I^-} \\rightarrow \\ce{I2} + 2e^-) \\implies 6\\ce{I^-} \\rightarrow 3\\ce{I2} + 6e^-$$\n$$2 \\times (\\ce{MnO4^-} + 2\\ce{H2O} + 3e^- \\rightarrow \\ce{MnO2(s)} + 4\\ce{OH^-}) \\implies 2\\ce{MnO4^-} + 4\\ce{H2O} + 6e^- \\rightarrow 2\\ce{MnO2(s)} + 8\\ce{OH^-}$$\n\n**5. Obtain the Final Net Ionic Equation**\nWe sum the two scaled half-reactions and cancel the electrons:\n$$2\\ce{MnO4^-} + 6\\ce{I^-} + 4\\ce{H2O} + 6e^- \\rightarrow 2\\ce{MnO2(s)} + 3\\ce{I2} + 8\\ce{OH^-} + 6e^-$$\nThe final balanced net ionic equation is:\n$$2\\ce{MnO4^-} + 6\\ce{I^-} + 4\\ce{H2O} \\rightarrow 2\\ce{MnO2(s)} + 3\\ce{I2} + 8\\ce{OH^-}$$\nThis equation is valid for the reaction initiated in neutral water. Since the balancing method for basic solution is identical (provided $\\ce{I2}$ is the product), the stoichiometry will be the same.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A.

The reduction of $2\\ce{MnO4^-}$ to $2\\ce{MnO2}$ involves a gain of $6$ electrons. The oxidation of $10\\ce{I^-}$ to $5\\ce{I2}$ involves a loss of $10$ electrons. The electrons are not balanced. This violates a primary principle of redox chemistry.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Neutral: $\\,2\\ce{MnO4^-} + 6\\ce{I^-} + 2\\ce{H2O} - 2\\ce{MnO2(s)} + 3\\ce{I2} + 4\\ce{OH^-}\\,$; Basic: double only the hydroxide coefficient.**\nWe check the balance of the provided equation. Left side has $2\\times4 + 2 = 10$ oxygen atoms. Right side has $2\\times2 + 4 = 8$ oxygen atoms. The equation is not balanced.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D.

It lacks oxygen and charge balance. Left side has $8$ oxygen atoms and a charge of $-8$. Right side has $4$ oxygen atoms and a charge of $0$. The second equation is also unbalanced for oxygen and charge.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E.

However, the description of the reaction in basic solution proposes a different reaction producing iodate, $\\ce{IO3^-}$. The problem statement explicitly forbids this pathway with the constraint: \"...so that molecular iodine produced is not subsequently converted to oxyanions.\" Therefore, this option contradicts the premises of the problem itself, making it an invalid description of the specified process.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2947705"}, {"introduction": "In solutions containing polyprotic species, multiple acid-base reactions can occur.

Combine these elements to derive the final expression for $K_{f}^{\\prime}$ and compute its value.\n\nStep 1: Activity Coefficients\nThe Davies equation is given as $-\\log_{10}\\gamma_{i}=A z_{i}^{2}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{I}}{1+\\sqrt{I}}-0.3\\,I\\right)$.\nGiven $A=0.509$ and $I=0.10$, the term in the parentheses is constant for all ions in the solution:\n$$ \\frac{\\sqrt{0.10}}{1+\\sqrt{0.10}} - 0.3(0.10) \\approx \\frac{0.31623}{1.31623} - 0.03 \\approx 0.24025 - 0.03 = 0.21025 $$\nFor monovalent ions ($z_{i}=\\pm 1$), such as $\\ce{H+}$ and $\\ce{NH4+}$:\n$$ -\\log_{10}\\gamma_{1} = (0.509)(1)^{2}(0.21025) \\approx 0.10702 $$\n$$ \\gamma_{1} = 10^{-0.10702} \\approx 0.7816 $$\nTherefore, $\\gamma_{\\ce{H+}} = \\gamma_{\\ce{NH4+}} \\approx 0.7816$.\n\nFor divalent ions ($z_{i}=\\pm 2$), such as $\\ce{Cu^{2+}}$ and $\\ce{[Cu(NH3)4]^{2+}}$:\n$$ -\\log_{10}\\gamma_{2} = (0.509)(2)^{2}(0.21025) = 4 \\times 0.10702 \\approx 0.42808 $$\n$$ \\gamma_{2} = 10^{-0.42808} \\approx 0.3732 $$\nTherefore, $\\gamma_{\\ce{Cu^{2+}}} = \\gamma_{\\ce{[Cu(NH3)4]^{2+}}} \\approx 0.3732$.\nThe activity coefficient of the neutral species $\\ce{NH3}$ is given as $\\gamma_{\\ce{NH3}} = 1$.\n\nStep 2: Relation between Thermodynamic and Concentration Constants\nThe thermodynamic cumulative formation constant for $\\ce{[Cu(NH3)4]^{2+}}$ is:\n$$ \\beta_{4}^{\\circ} = \\frac{a_{\\ce{[Cu(NH3)4]^{2+}}}}{a_{\\ce{Cu^{2+}}} (a_{\\ce{NH3}})^{4}} = \\frac{[\\ce{[Cu(NH3)4]^{2+}}]\\gamma_{\\ce{[Cu(NH3)4]^{2+}}}}{[\\ce{Cu^{2+}}]\\gamma_{\\ce{Cu^{2+}}} ([\\ce{NH3}]\\gamma_{\\ce{NH3}})^{4}} $$\nThe concentration-based constant is $\\beta_{4} = \\frac{[\\ce{[Cu(NH3)4]^{2+}}]}{[\\ce{Cu^{2+}}][\\ce{NH3}]^{4}}$. Thus:\n$$ \\beta_{4} = \\beta_{4}^{\\circ} \\frac{\\gamma_{\\ce{Cu^{2+}}} (\\gamma_{\\ce{NH3}})^{4}}{\\gamma_{\\ce{[Cu(NH3)4]^{2+}}}} $$\nSince $\\gamma_{\\ce{Cu^{2+}}} = \\gamma_{\\ce{[Cu(NH3)4]^{2+}}}$ and $\\gamma_{\\ce{NH3}}=1$, the activity coefficient corrections for the complexation equilibrium cancel out:\n$$ \\beta_{4} = \\beta_{4}^{\\circ} $$\n\nStep 3: Side-Reaction Coefficient for Ammonia ($\\alpha_{\\ce{NH3}}$)\nThe fraction of ammonia that is not protonated, $\\alpha_{\\ce{NH3}}$, is defined as:\n$$ \\alpha_{\\ce{NH3}} = \\frac{[\\ce{NH3}]}{C_{\\mathrm{T,NH3}}} = \\frac{[\\ce{NH3}]}{[\\ce{NH3}] + [\\ce{NH4+}]} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{[\\ce{NH4+}]}{[\\ce{NH3}]}} $$\nThe thermodynamic acid dissociation constant for $\\ce{NH4+}$ is $K_{a}^{\\circ} = \\frac{a_{\\ce{NH3}}a_{\\ce{H+}}}{a_{\\ce{NH4+}}} = \\frac{[\\ce{NH3}]\\gamma_{\\ce{NH3}}a_{\\ce{H+}}}{[\\ce{NH4+}]\\gamma_{\\ce{NH4+}}}$.\nRearranging for the concentration ratio:\n$$ \\frac{[\\ce{NH4+}]}{[\\ce{NH3}]} = \\frac{\\gamma_{\\ce{NH3}}a_{\\ce{H+}}}{K_{a}^{\\circ}\\gamma_{\\ce{NH4+}}} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\alpha_{\\ce{NH3}}$:\n$$ \\alpha_{\\ce{NH3}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{\\gamma_{\\ce{NH3}}a_{\\ce{H+}}}{K_{a}^{\\circ}\\gamma_{\\ce{NH4+}}}} $$\nWe are given $\\mathrm{p}K_{a}^{\\circ} = 9.25$, so $K_{a}^{\\circ} = 10^{-9.25}$. The pH is $10.00$, so $a_{\\ce{H+}} = 10^{-10.00}$. Using $\\gamma_{\\ce{NH3}}=1$ and $\\gamma_{\\ce{NH4+}} \\approx 0.7816$:\n$$ \\alpha_{\\ce{NH3}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{(1)(10^{-10.00})}{(10^{-9.25})(0.7816)}} = \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{10^{-0.75}}{0.7816}} \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{0.17783}{0.7816}} \\approx \\frac{1}{1 + 0.22752} = \\frac{1}{1.22752} \\approx 0.81465 $$\n\nStep 4: Derivation and Calculation of $K_{f}^{\\prime}$\nWe relate the defined conditional constant $K_{f}^{\\prime}$ to the concentration-based stability constant $\\beta_4$.\nStarting from the definition of $\\beta_4$:\n$$ [\\ce{[Cu(NH3)4]^{2+}}] = \\beta_{4}[\\ce{Cu^{2+}}][\\ce{NH3}]^{4} $$\nSubstitute this into the expression for $K_{f}^{\\prime}$:\n$$ K_{f}^{\\prime} = \\frac{\\beta_{4}[\\ce{Cu^{2+}}][\\ce{NH3}]^{4}}{[\\ce{Cu^{2+}}]\\left(C_{\\mathrm{T,NH3}}\\right)^{4}} = \\beta_{4} \\left(\\frac{[\\ce{NH3}]}{C_{\\mathrm{T,NH3}}}\\right)^{4} $$\nRecognizing the term in parentheses as $\\alpha_{\\ce{NH3}}$, we have:\n$$ K_{f}^{\\prime} = \\beta_{4}(\\alpha_{\\ce{NH3}})^{4} $$\nAs established in Step 2, $\\beta_{4} = \\beta_{4}^{\\circ} = 10^{12.60}$. Now we can calculate the numerical value of $K_{f}^{\\prime}$:\n$$ K_{f}^{\\prime} = (10^{12.60}) (0.81465)^{4} $$\n$$ K_{f}^{\\prime} \\approx (3.981 \\times 10^{12}) (0.4398) \\approx 1.7509 \\times 10^{12} $$\nRounding to three significant figures, the value is $1.75 \\times 10^{12}$.\n\nBrief explanation of the result:\nThe calculated conditional formation constant, $K_{f}^{\\prime} \\approx 1.75 \\times 10^{12}$, is an exceptionally large number. This magnitude signifies that the equilibrium for the overall reaction $\\ce{Cu^{2+} + 4\\{\\text{total ammonia}\\} => [Cu(NH3)4]^{2+}}$ lies overwhelmingly to the product side under the specified conditions of $\\mathrm{pH}=10.00$ and $I=0.10$. A reaction with such a large equilibrium constant is considered quantitative, meaning it proceeds virtually to completion. Therefore, writing a net ionic equation with a single arrow (e.g., $\\ce{Cu^{2+}(aq) + 4NH3(aq) -> [Cu(NH3)4]^{2+}(aq)}$) is a chemically sound and useful simplification, as the reverse reaction is negligible.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.75 \\times 10^{12}}$$", "id": "2947713"}]}
