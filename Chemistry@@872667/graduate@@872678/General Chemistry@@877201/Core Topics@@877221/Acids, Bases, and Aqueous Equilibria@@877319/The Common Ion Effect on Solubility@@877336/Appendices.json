The analysis must be grounded in the principles of chemical equilibrium.\n\nFirst, we establish the relevant chemical equilibrium. Calcium fluoride is a sparingly soluble salt that dissolves according to the following stoichiometry:\n$$CaF_{2}(s) \\rightleftharpoons Ca^{2+}(aq) + 2F^{-}(aq)$$\nThe equilibrium condition for this dissolution process is described by the Law of Mass Action. The thermodynamic solubility product, $K_{sp}$, is defined in terms of the activities of the aqueous species. For a species $i$, its activity $a_i$ is related to its molar concentration $[i]$ by the activity coefficient $\\gamma_i$, such that $a_i = \\gamma_i [i]$.\n$$K_{sp} = a_{Ca^{2+}} \\cdot (a_{F^{-}})^2 = (\\gamma_{Ca^{2+}}[Ca^{2+}]) \\cdot (\\gamma_{F^{-}}[F^{-}])^2$$\nThe problem provides concentrations in molarity and does not provide information to calculate activity coefficients. Therefore, as is common in such problems, we invoke the approximation that the solution is sufficiently dilute such that the activity coefficients of the ionic species are approximately unity, i.e., $\\gamma_{Ca^{2+}} \\approx 1$ and $\\gamma_{F^{-}} \\approx 1$. This reduces the activity-based expression to a concentration-based one:\n$$K_{sp} = [Ca^{2+}][F^{-}]^2 = 1.46 \\times 10^{-10}$$\n\nNext, we express the equilibrium concentrations of the ions in terms of the molar solubility, $s$. The variable $s$ is defined as the concentration of $Ca^{2+}$ ions originating from the dissolution of $CaF_{2}(s)$. By stoichiometry, for every mole of $CaF_{2}$ that dissolves, one mole of $Ca^{2+}$ and two moles of $F^{-}$ are produced. Thus, at equilibrium:\n$$[Ca^{2+}] = s$$\nThe fluoride ions, $F^{-}$, originate from two sources: the complete dissociation of the initial sodium fluoride ($NaF(aq) \\to Na^{+}(aq) + F^{-}(aq)$), which contributes a concentration $C_0 = 0.020\\ \\mathrm{M}$, and the dissolution of $CaF_2$, which contributes a concentration of $2s$. Therefore, the total equilibrium concentration of fluoride is:\n$$[F^{-}] = C_0 + 2s$$\n\nSubstituting these expressions for the equilibrium concentrations into the $K_{sp}$ equation yields the governing algebraic equation for $s$:\n$$K_{sp} = (s)(C_0 + 2s)^2$$\nTo reduce this to a cubic polynomial with constant coefficients, we expand the squared term:\n$$K_{sp} = s(C_0^2 + 4C_0s + 4s^2)$$\n$$K_{sp} = C_0^2s + 4C_0s^2 + 4s^3$$\nRearranging this into the standard polynomial form, $ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0$, gives:\n$$4s^3 + 4C_0s^2 + C_0^2s - K_{sp} = 0$$\nThis is the exact cubic equation for the molar solubility $s$.

The presence of a common ion, $F^{-}$, from $NaF$ will significantly suppress the dissolution of $CaF_2$ according to Le Châtelier's principle. Consequently, the molar solubility $s$ is expected to be very small compared to the initial concentration of the common ion, $C_0$.\nWe posit the approximation $2s \\ll C_0$.\nIf this holds, the total fluoride concentration can be approximated as:\n$$[F^{-}] = C_0 + 2s \\approx C_0$$\nUnder this simplifying assumption, the equilibrium expression becomes:\n$$K_{sp} \\approx s \\cdot (C_0)^2$$\nSolving for $s$ yields the approximate solubility, which we denote $s_{approx}$:\n$$s_{approx} = \\frac{K_{sp}}{(C_0)^2} = \\frac{1.46 \\times 10^{-10}}{(0.020)^2} = \\frac{1.46 \\times 10^{-10}}{4.0 \\times 10^{-4}} = 3.65 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ L^{-1}}$$\n\nNow, we must verify the validity of our approximation a posteriori.

To confirm, we can use this value of $s_{approx}$ to calculate a corrected solubility, $s'$, using the full expression for $[F^{-}]$:\n$$s' = \\frac{K_{sp}}{(C_0 + 2s_{approx})^2} = \\frac{1.46 \\times 10^{-10}}{(0.020 + 2(3.65 \\times 10^{-7}))^2} = \\frac{1.46 \\times 10^{-10}}{(0.02000073)^2} \\approx 3.64977 \\times 10^{-7}\\ \\mathrm{mol\\ L^{-1}}$$\nThe difference between $s_{approx}$ and $s'$ is insignificant.

The problem is well-posed and scientifically sound, containing all necessary data and definitions for a complete solution.\n\nFirst, we address the qualitative explanation. The primary equilibrium is the dissolution of the sparingly soluble salt:\n$$ \\mathrm{CaC_2O_4(s)} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{Ca^{2+}(aq)} + \\mathrm{C_2O_4^{2-}(aq)} $$\nThe equilibrium for this process is described by the solubility product constant, $K_{sp}$:\n$$ K_{sp} = [\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}][\\mathrm{C_2O_4^{2-}}] = 2.30 \\times 10^{-9} $$\nIn a neutral solution, the dissolution is limited by the accumulation of the product ions $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ and $\\mathrm{C_2O_4^{2-}}$. The \"common ion effect\" describes the phenomenon where the solubility of a salt is decreased by the presence of a common ion from an external source. In this context, the phrase \"common ion effect of oxalate\" can be interpreted as the inherent solubility-limiting effect of the product oxalate ion, $\\mathrm{C_2O_4^{2-}}$, on the dissolution equilibrium.\n\nThe oxalate ion, $\\mathrm{C_2O_4^{2-}}$, is the conjugate base of the weak diprotic acid, oxalic acid ($\\mathrm{H_2C_2O_4}$). In an acidic solution, the oxalate ion reacts with hydronium ions ($\\mathrm{H^+}$) in a stepwise manner:\n$$ \\mathrm{C_2O_4^{2-}(aq)} + \\mathrm{H^+(aq)} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{HC_2O_4^{-}(aq)} \\quad (K = 1/K_{a2}) $$\n$$ \\mathrm{HC_2O_4^{-}(aq)} + \\mathrm{H^+(aq)} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{H_2C_2O_4(aq)} \\quad (K = 1/K_{a1}) $$\nThese subsequent acid-base equilibria consume the free oxalate ion, $\\mathrm{C_2O_4^{2-}}$, from the solution. According to Le Châtelier's principle, the removal of a product species ($\\mathrm{C_2O_4^{2-}}$) from the dissolution equilibrium causes the equilibrium to shift to the right, in favor of dissolving more solid $\\mathrm{CaC_2O_4(s)}$. This leads to an increase in the concentration of $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ ions at equilibrium, and thus a higher molar solubility. Therefore, the presence of $\\mathrm{H^+}$ \"reduces\" the limiting impact that the accumulation of $\\mathrm{C_2O_4^{2-}}$ would otherwise have, thereby enhancing the overall solubility of the salt.\n\nNext, we proceed with the quantitative calculation of the molar solubility, $s$. By definition, the molar solubility $s$ is the number of moles of $\\mathrm{CaC_2O_4(s)}$ that dissolve per liter of solution. From the stoichiometry of the dissolution, this is equal to the equilibrium concentration of the calcium ion:\n$$ s = [\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}] $$\nA mass balance on the oxalate species requires that the total concentration of all forms of oxalate in solution must also equal the molar solubility, as all oxalate originates from the dissolved solid:\n$$ s = [\\mathrm{C_2O_4}]_{total} = [\\mathrm{H_2C_2O_4}] + [\\mathrm{HC_2O_4^{-}}] + [\\mathrm{C_2O_4^{2-}}] $$\nWe can express the total oxalate concentration in terms of the free oxalate concentration, $[\\mathrm{C_2O_4^{2-}}]$, using the acid dissociation constants, $K_{a1}$ and $K_{a2}$:\n$$ K_{a1} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{H^+}][\\mathrm{HC_2O_4^{-}}]}{[\\mathrm{H_2C_2O_4}]} = 5.60 \\times 10^{-2} $$\n$$ K_{a2} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{H^+}][\\mathrm{C_2O_4^{2-}}]}{[\\mathrm{HC_2O_4^{-}}]} = 5.42 \\times 10^{-5} $$\nFrom these definitions, we can write $[\\mathrm{HC_2O_4^{-}}]$ and $[\\mathrm{H_2C_2O_4}]$ in terms of $[\\mathrm{C_2O_4^{2-}}]$ and the fixed hydrogen ion concentration $[\\mathrm{H^+}] = 10^{-2.00} = 1.00 \\times 10^{-2} \\, \\mathrm{M}$:\n$$ [\\mathrm{HC_2O_4^{-}}] = \\frac{[\\mathrm{H^+}][\\mathrm{C_2O_4^{2-}}]}{K_{a2}} $$\n$$ [\\mathrm{H_2C_2O_4}] = \\frac{[\\mathrm{H^+}][\\mathrm{HC_2O_4^{-}}]}{K_{a1}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{H^+}]}{K_{a1}} \\left( \\frac{[\\mathrm{H^+}][\\mathrm{C_2O_4^{2-}}]}{K_{a2}} \\right) = \\frac{[\\mathrm{H^+}]^2[\\mathrm{C_2O_4^{2-}}]}{K_{a1}K_{a2}} $$\nThe fraction of total oxalate present as the free ion $\\mathrm{C_2O_4^{2-}}$ is denoted by $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{C_2O_4^{2-}}}$:\n$$ \\alpha_{\\mathrm{C_2O_4^{2-}}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{C_2O_4^{2-}}]}{[\\mathrm{C_2O_4}]_{total}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{C_2O_4^{2-}}]}{[\\mathrm{H_2C_2O_4}] + [\\mathrm{HC_2O_4^{-}}] + [\\mathrm{C_2O_4^{2-}}]} $$\nSubstituting the expressions for the protonated species:\n$$ \\alpha_{\\mathrm{C_2O_4^{2-}}} = \\frac{[\\mathrm{C_2O_4^{2-}}]}{\\frac{[\\mathrm{H^+}]^2[\\mathrm{C_2O_4^{2-}}]}{K_{a1}K_{a2}} + \\frac{[\\mathrm{H^+}][\\mathrm{C_2O_4^{2-}}]}{K_{a2}} + [\\mathrm{C_2O_4^{2-}}]} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{[\\mathrm{H^+}]^2}{K_{a1}K_{a2}} + \\frac{[\\mathrm{H^+}]}{K_{a2}} + 1} $$\nThis can be rearranged to a more convenient form:\n$$ \\alpha_{\\mathrm{C_2O_4^{2-}}} = \\frac{K_{a1}K_{a2}}{[\\mathrm{H^+}]^2 + K_{a1}[\\mathrm{H^+}] + K_{a1}K_{a2}} $$\nNow we can substitute the given numerical values:\n$$ [\\mathrm{H^+}] = 1.00 \\times 10^{-2} $$\n$$ K_{a1} = 5.60 \\times 10^{-2} $$\n$$ K_{a2} = 5.42 \\times 10^{-5} $$\n$$ K_{a1}K_{a2} = (5.60 \\times 10^{-2})(5.42 \\times 10^{-5}) = 3.0352 \\times 10^{-6} $$\n$$ \\alpha_{\\mathrm{C_2O_4^{2-}}} = \\frac{3.0352 \\times 10^{-6}}{(1.00 \\times 10^{-2})^2 + (5.60 \\times 10^{-2})(1.00 \\times 10^{-2}) + 3.0352 \\times 10^{-6}} $$\n$$ \\alpha_{\\mathrm{C_2O_4^{2-}}} = \\frac{3.0352 \\times 10^{-6}}{1.00 \\times 10^{-4} + 5.60 \\times 10^{-4} + 3.0352 \\times 10^{-6}} $$\n$$ \\alpha_{\\mathrm{C_2O_4^{2-}}} = \\frac{3.0352 \\times 10^{-6}}{6.60 \\times 10^{-4} + 0.030352 \\times 10^{-4}} = \\frac{3.0352 \\times 10^{-6}}{6.630352 \\times 10^{-4}} \\approx 4.5777 \\times 10^{-3} $$\nThe relationship between total oxalate and free oxalate is $[\\mathrm{C_2O_4^{2-}}] = \\alpha_{\\mathrm{C_2O_4^{2-}}}[\\mathrm{C_2O_4}]_{total}$.

Consequently, activities are equal to molar concentrations, $a_i = [i]$. The solubility product expression becomes:\n$$K_{sp} = [Ag^{+}][Cl^{-}]_{total}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the ion concentrations in terms of the molar solubility $s$:\n$$1.8 \\times 10^{-10} = s(0.010 + s)$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $s$: $s^2 + 0.010s - 1.8 \\times 10^{-10} = 0$.\nGiven the small value of $K_{sp}$, it is expected that the solubility $s$ will be significantly smaller than the initial chloride concentration, $0.010\\ \\mathrm{M}$. We can therefore make the approximation $0.010 + s \\approx 0.010$.

Second, the ionic strength we used was $I=0.010\\ \\mathrm{M}$. The more precise value is $I = 0.010 + s_{corrected} = 0.010 + 2.157 \\times 10^{-8} \\approx 0.01000002157\\ \\mathrm{M}$. The difference from the approximated value is insignificant and would lead to a negligible change in the calculated activity coefficients, well within the precision required. Both approximations are therefore valid.\n\nThe activity coefficients are less than unity, which reflects the stabilization of ions by the ionic atmosphere, reducing their effective concentration or \"activity\". This leads to an increase in solubility compared to the ideal case, as observed ($s_{corrected} > s_{ideal}$).\n\nRounding the two results to four significant figures gives:\n$s_{ideal} = 1.800 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{M}$\n$s_{corrected} = 2.157 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\mathrm{M}$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1.800 \\times 10^{-8} & 2.157 \\times 10^{-8}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2958963"}]}
