It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a clear set of tasks based on the fundamental principles of chemical equilibrium, including mass balance, charge balance, and the Law of Mass Action. All provided data are physically realistic and internally consistent. Therefore, the problem is solvable, and a rigorous solution follows.\n\nThe central task is to find the equilibrium hydrogen ion concentration, denoted as $h \\equiv [\\mathrm{H}^{+}]$, for several aqueous systems at $25^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$. The equilibrium state is dictated by the principle of electroneutrality, which demands that the total concentration of positive charges must equal the total concentration of negative charges. This condition is expressed as an equation where the algebraic sum of all charges, weighted by concentration, equals zero:\n$$\n\\sum_{i} c_i z_i = 0\n$$\nwhere $c_i$ is the molar concentration of species $i$ and $z_i$ is its integer charge.\n\nFor the systems under consideration, the charged species include $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$, $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, fixed ions from fully dissociated strong electrolytes, and the various protonation states of weak acid families. The electroneutrality equation is specified as:\n$$\nf(h) = [\\mathrm{H}^{+}] - [\\mathrm{OH}^{-}] + \\sum_{\\text{families}} \\sum_{j=0}^{n} [\\mathrm{H}_{n-j}\\mathrm{A}^{z_{0}-j}] (z_{0}-j) + \\sum_{i} c^{(+)}_{i} z^{(+)}_{i} + \\sum_{k} c^{(-)}_{k} z^{(-)}_{k} = 0\n$$\nUsing the autoionization constant of water, $K_w = [\\mathrm{H}^{+}][\\mathrm{OH}^{-}] = 1.0 \\times 10^{-14}$, we express $[\\mathrm{OH}^{-}]$ as $K_w/h$. The concentrations of the species from a given weak acid family are expressed in terms of the total analytical concentration $C_{\\mathrm{T}}$ and the species distribution fractions $\\alpha_j(h)$, such that $[\\mathrm{H}_{n-j}\\mathrm{A}^{z_{0}-j}] = \\alpha_j(h) C_{\\mathrm{T}}$. The net charge from fixed ions is aggregated into a single term, $C_{fixed} = \\sum_{i} c^{(+)}_{i} z^{(+)}_{i} + \\sum_{k} c^{(-)}_{k} z^{(-)}_{k}$.\n\nThe fraction $\\alpha_j(h)$ for the species $\\mathrm{H}_{n-j}\\mathrm{A}^{z_0-j}$ of an $n$-protic acid family is derived from the Law of Mass Action and mass balance. It is given by the general formula:\n$$\n\\alpha_j(h) = \\frac{ \\left( \\prod_{k=1}^{j} K_{a,k} \\right) h^{n-j} }{ \\sum_{l=0}^{n} \\left( \\prod_{k=1}^{l} K_{a,k} \\right) h^{n-l} }\n$$\nwhere $K_{a,k}$ are the stepwise acid dissociation constants and the product $\\prod_{k=1}^{0}$ is defined as $1$.\n\nSubstituting these relations into the electroneutrality condition yields a single-variable equation $f(h) = 0$:\n$$\nf(h) = h - \\frac{K_w}{h} + C_{fixed} + \\sum_{\\text{families}} C_{\\mathrm{T}} \\left( \\frac{ \\sum_{j=0}^{n} (z_0-j) \\left( \\prod_{k=1}^{j} K_{a,k} \\right) h^{n-j} }{ \\sum_{l=0}^{n} \\left( \\prod_{k=1}^{l} K_{a,k} \\right) h^{n-l} } \\right) = 0\n$$\nThis function $f(h)$ is strictly monotonic for $h0$. The derivative $f'(h)$ is always positive, as it is a sum of positive terms: $1$, $K_w/h^2$, and terms related to the derivatives of the average charges of acid families, which are also intrinsically positive. The strict monotonicity guarantees that a unique positive root for $h$ exists. This root can be found reliably using a numerical algorithm, such as Brent's method, over a physically meaningful interval for $h$, such as $[10^{-14}, 1]$. Once the unique equilibrium value of $h$ is found, the $\\mathrm{pH}$ is calculated via its definition: $\\mathrm{pH} = -\\log_{10}(h)$.\n\nThis general procedure is applied to each of the six specified cases. For cases A and E, which contain only strong electrolytes and no weak acid families, the charge balance equation simplifies to a quadratic form, $h^2 - C_{net}h - K_w = 0$, which can be solved analytically. For cases B, C, D, and F, which involve weak acid families, the full charge balance function is constructed and solved numerically.\n\nThe corresponding program implements this exact logic. A general function is defined to construct the charge balance equation $f(h)$ for an arbitrary set of fixed ions and acid families. This function is then provided to a numerical root-finding solver from the SciPy library to determine $h$ for each case.

The solution also contains the following potential interferents at the stated molar concentrations $c_j$ and single-ion activity coefficients $\\gamma_j$ (both at $35.00\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$): sodium $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ with $c_{\\mathrm{Na}^{+}} = 0.100$ and $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{Na}^{+}} = 0.75$, potassium $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$ with $c_{\\mathrm{K}^{+}} = 0.0100$ and $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{K}^{+}} = 0.75$, lithium $\\mathrm{Li}^{+}$ with $c_{\\mathrm{Li}^{+}} = 0.0200$ and $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{Li}^{+}} = 0.70$, and magnesium $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ with $c_{\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}} = 0.00100$ and $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}} = 0.40$.

The $\\mathrm{pH}$ is dimensionless; report no units.", "solution": "**Derivation**\nThe potential, $E$, of an ion-selective electrode (ISE) membrane is described by the Nernst equation. For a primary ion $i$ with charge $z_i$ and activity $a_i$, the potential is given by:\n$$E = E_{\\text{const}} + \\frac{RT}{z_i F} \\ln(a_i)$$\nwhere $E_{\\text{const}}$ is a term encompassing all constant potentials in the electrochemical cell, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $F$ is the Faraday constant. For a hydrogen ion electrode, the primary ion is $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$, so $i = \\mathrm{H}^{+}$ and its charge is $z_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = +1$. The equation, expressed using the base-$10$ logarithm, becomes:\n$$E = E_{\\text{const}} + \\frac{2.303RT}{F} \\log_{10}(a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}})$$\nA pH meter is calibrated to convert this potential into a $\\mathrm{pH}$ value using the definition $\\mathrm{pH} = -\\log_{10}(a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}})$. Thus, the measured potential is ideally a linear function of $\\mathrm{pH}$.\n\nIn the presence of interfering ions $j$ with charges $z_j$ and activities $a_j$, the electrode no longer responds exclusively to the primary ion $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$. Its response is described by the Nikolsky-Eisenman equation, which models the potential as a function of an effective activity that includes contributions from interfering species. The total potential is given by:\n$$E = E_{\\text{const}} + \\frac{RT}{z_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} F} \\ln \\left( a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} + \\sum_j K_{\\mathrm{H},j} a_j^{z_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}/z_j} \\right)$$\nHere, $K_{\\mathrm{H},j}$ is the selectivity coefficient of the electrode for the primary ion $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$ over the interfering ion $j$. The term inside the logarithm represents the effective hydrogen ion activity, $a'_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$, that the electrode \"senses\":\n$$a'_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} + \\sum_j K_{\\mathrm{H},j} a_j^{z_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}/z_j}$$\nThe problem states that the instrument displays a $\\mathrm{pH}$ value corresponding to the negative base-$10$ logarithm of this effective activity. Therefore, the displayed $\\mathrm{pH}$, denoted as $\\mathrm{pH}_{\\text{disp}}$, is:\n$$\\mathrm{pH}_{\\text{disp}} = -\\log_{10}(a'_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}) = -\\log_{10} \\left( a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} + \\sum_j K_{\\mathrm{H},j} a_j^{z_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}/z_j} \\right)$$\nThis is the required general analytic expression. For the specific interferents given in the problem ($\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, $\\mathrm{K}^{+}$, $\\mathrm{Li}^{+}$, $\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$) with their respective charges ($z_{\\mathrm{Na}^{+}}=+1$, $z_{\\mathrm{K}^{+}}=+1$, $z_{\\mathrm{Li}^{+}}=+1$, $z_{\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}}=+2$) and with $z_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}=+1$, the expression becomes:\n$$\\mathrm{pH}_{\\text{disp}} = -\\log_{10} \\left( a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} + K_{\\mathrm{H},\\mathrm{Na}} a_{\\mathrm{Na}^{+}}^{1/1} + K_{\\mathrm{H},\\mathrm{K}} a_{\\mathrm{K}^{+}}^{1/1} + K_{\\mathrm{H},\\mathrm{Li}} a_{\\mathrm{Li}^{+}}^{1/1} + K_{\\mathrm{H},\\mathrm{Mg}} a_{\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}}^{1/2} \\right)$$\nSimplifying the exponents, the final derived expression for this specific system is:\n$$\\mathrm{pH}_{\\text{disp}} = -\\log_{10} \\left( a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} + K_{\\mathrm{H},\\mathrm{Na}} a_{\\mathrm{Na}^{+}} + K_{\\mathrm{H},\\mathrm{K}} a_{\\mathrm{K}^{+}} + K_{\\mathrm{H},\\mathrm{Li}} a_{\\mathrm{Li}^{+}} + K_{\\mathrm{H},\\mathrm{Mg}} \\sqrt{a_{\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}}} \\right)$$\n\n**Calculation**\nFirst, we calculate the activity $a_j = \\gamma_j c_j$ for each interfering ion.\n$a_{\\mathrm{Na}^{+}} = (0.75)(0.100) = 0.075$\n$a_{\\mathrm{K}^{+}} = (0.75)(0.0100) = 0.0075$\n$a_{\\mathrm{Li}^{+}} = (0.70)(0.0200) = 0.014$\n$a_{\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}} = (0.40)(0.00100) = 0.00040$\n\nNext, we calculate the effective hydrogen ion activity, $a'_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$, by summing the true activity of $\\mathrm{H}^{+}$ and the interference terms.\n$a'_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} + K_{\\mathrm{H},\\mathrm{Na}} a_{\\mathrm{Na}^{+}} + K_{\\mathrm{H},\\mathrm{K}} a_{\\mathrm{K}^{+}} + K_{\\mathrm{H},\\mathrm{Li}} a_{\\mathrm{Li}^{+}} + K_{\\mathrm{H},\\mathrm{Mg}} \\sqrt{a_{\\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}}}$\n\nSubstitute the numerical values:\n$a'_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = (1.00 \\times 10^{-12}) + (5.0 \\times 10^{-11})(0.075) + (1.0 \\times 10^{-12})(0.0075) + (2.0 \\times 10^{-9})(0.014) + (1.0 \\times 10^{-14})\\sqrt{0.00040}$\n\nEvaluate each term:\n- First term (H$^{+}$): $1.00 \\times 10^{-12}$\n- Second term (Na$^{+}$): $5.0 \\times 10^{-11} \\times 0.075 = 3.75 \\times 10^{-12}$\n- Third term (K$^{+}$): $1.0 \\times 10^{-12} \\times 0.0075 = 7.5 \\times 10^{-15} = 0.0075 \\times 10^{-12}$\n- Fourth term (Li$^{+}$): $2.0 \\times 10^{-9} \\times 0.014 = 2.8 \\times 10^{-11} = 28 \\times 10^{-12}$\n- Fifth term (Mg$^{2+}$): $1.0 \\times 10^{-14} \\times \\sqrt{0.00040} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-14} \\times 0.02 = 2.0 \\times 10^{-16} = 0.0002 \\times 10^{-12}$\n\nSum the terms:\n$a'_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = (1.00 + 3.75 + 0.0075 + 28 + 0.0002) \\times 10^{-12}$\n$a'_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}} = 32.7577 \\times 10^{-12} = 3.27577 \\times 10^{-11}$\n\nFinally, calculate the displayed $\\mathrm{pH}$:\n$\\mathrm{pH}_{\\text{disp}} = -\\log_{10}(a'_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}) = -\\log_{10}(3.27577 \\times 10^{-11})$\n$\\mathrm{pH}_{\\text{disp}} = 10.48466...$\n\nThe problem requires rounding the final answer to four significant figures.\n$\\mathrm{pH}_{\\text{disp}} \\approx 10.48$\n\nThe true $\\mathrm{pH}$ of the solution is $-\\log_{10}(1.00 \\times 10^{-12}) = 12.00$.
