Different conventions would change the numerical value of $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$ and hence of $pH$.\n- In concentrated solutions, junction potentials, specific ion interactions, and deviations from the Debye–Hückel limiting law complicate the operational determination of $pH$ by glass electrodes. The operational $pH$ scale is tied to standard buffer solutions and conventions rather than a direct measurement of $a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$.\n- The concept of $pH$ presumes a defined standard state and solvent medium. Changing the standard state (e.g., from molality to molarity) or the medium alters $a_{\\mathrm{H}^{+}}$ and the corresponding $pH$.
