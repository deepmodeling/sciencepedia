The denominator is the sum of all metal ions that are part of a complex: $[ML] + [ML_2]$.\n$$\n\\bar{n} = \\frac{[ML] + 2[ML_2]}{[ML] + [ML_2]}\n$$\nIt is imperative to note that this is not the standard Bjerrum formation function, which is defined with the total metal concentration, $C_M^T$, in the denominator. The specified quantity represents the average number of ligands per complexed metal center, rather than per total metal center in the system. Following the problem's explicit instruction, we substitute the equilibrium expressions:\n$$\n\\bar{n} = \\frac{\\beta_1[M][L] + 2\\beta_2[M][L]^2}{\\beta_1[M][L] + \\beta_2[M][L]^2}\n$$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $[M]$ gives a simplified expression that depends only on $[L]$ and the formation constants:\n$$\n\\bar{n} = \\frac{\\beta_1[L] + 2\\beta_2[L]^2}{\\beta_1[L] + \\beta_2[L]^2}\n$$\nThe computational procedure is as follows:\n1. For each parameter set, calculate the constant values of $[H^+]$, $\\alpha_M([\\mathrm{H}^{+}])$, and $\\alpha_L([\\mathrm{H}^{+}])$.\n2. Numerically solve the equation $f([L]) = 0$ to find the equilibrium free ligand concentration, $[L]$.\n3. Use the solved value of $[L]$ to calculate $\\bar{n}$ using the derived formula.\n4.
