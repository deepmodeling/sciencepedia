The two definitions of STP correspond to the historical (pre-$1982$) and current IUPAC standards, respectively, making the premise factually correct and relevant to chemistry. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary constants and conditions, and asks for clearly defined quantitative results. The language is objective and precise. There are no contradictions, ambiguities, or unrealistic conditions. The inclusion of the chemical reaction context does not introduce flaws; it provides a physical scenario to frame the abstract comparison of standards.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem is deemed valid. A rigorous solution follows.\n\nThe analysis will proceed in two parts, corresponding to the two tasks. The ideal gas law, $PV = nRT$, is the fundamental principle for all calculations.\n\n**Part 1: Discrepancy in Molar Volume**\n\nThe molar volume, $V_m$, is defined as the volume $V$ occupied by one mole of a substance, $n=1\\,\\text{mol}$. From the ideal gas law, it is given by:\n$$V_m = \\frac{V}{n} = \\frac{RT}{P}$$\n\nThe standard temperatures for both laboratories are identical: $T_A = T_B = 273.15\\,\\text{K}$. For simplicity, this temperature will be denoted as $T_{STP}$.\n\nFor Lab A, the pressure is $P_A = 101325\\,\\text{Pa}$. The molar volume, $V_{m,A}$, is:\n$$V_{m,A} = \\frac{R T_{STP}}{P_A}$$\n\nFor Lab B, the pressure is $P_B = 1.00000 \\times 10^5\\,\\text{Pa}$. The molar volume, $V_{m,B}$, is:\n$$V_{m,B} = \\frac{R T_{STP}}{P_B}$$\n\nThe requested fractional discrepancy in molar volume is $(V_{m,B} - V_{m,A})/V_{m,A}$. This can be expressed as:\n$$\\frac{V_{m,B} - V_{m,A}}{V_{m,A}} = \\frac{V_{m,B}}{V_{m,A}} - 1$$\n\nSubstituting the expressions for $V_{m,A}$ and $V_{m,B}$:\n$$\\frac{V_{m,B}}{V_{m,A}} - 1 = \\frac{\\frac{R T_{STP}}{P_B}}{\\frac{R T_{STP}}{P_A}} - 1 = \\frac{P_A}{P_B} - 1$$\n\nThe discrepancy depends only on the ratio of the two standard pressures. Inserting the given values:\n$$\\frac{P_A}{P_B} - 1 = \\frac{101325\\,\\text{Pa}}{1.00000 \\times 10^5\\,\\text{Pa}} - 1 = 1.01325 - 1 = 0.01325$$\n\nTo the required six significant figures, this is $0.0132500$.\n\n**Part 2: Discrepancy in Reported Moles**\n\nA fixed quantity of nitrogen gas is produced. The actual number of moles of $\\text{N}_2(g)$, denoted $n_{true}$, is determined by stoichiometry from the decomposition of $m = 50.000\\,\\text{g}$ of $\\text{NaN}_3$.\nThe moles of $\\text{NaN}_3$ are:\n$$n_{\\text{NaN}_3} = \\frac{m}{M(\\text{NaN}_3)} = \\frac{50.000\\,\\text{g}}{65.00977\\,\\text{g}\\,\\text{mol}^{-1}}$$\nFrom the reaction stoichiometry $2\\,\\text{NaN}_{3} \\rightarrow 3\\,\\text{N}_{2}$, the mole ratio is $3/2$. Therefore:\n$$n_{true} = n_{\\text{N}_2} = n_{\\text{NaN}_3} \\times \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{m}{M(\\text{NaN}_3)} \\times \\frac{3}{2}$$\n\nLab A measures the volume of this gas, $V_{obs}$, after bringing it to its STP conditions ($T_A, P_A$). According to the ideal gas law:\n$$P_A V_{obs} = n_{true} R T_A$$\nThus, the observed volume is $V_{obs} = \\frac{n_{true} R T_A}{P_A}$.\n\nLab A then calculates the number of moles, $n_A$, by dividing this observed volume by its standard molar volume, $V_{m,A}$.\n$$n_A = \\frac{V_{obs}}{V_{m,A}} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{n_{true} R T_A}{P_A}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{R T_A}{P_A}\\right)} = n_{true}$$\nThis result is logically necessary; Lab A's procedure is internally consistent and correctly recovers the true number of moles.\n\nLab B observes the same physical volume, $V_{obs}$. However, Lab B uses its own standard molar volume, $V_{m,B}$, to calculate the number of moles, $n_B$.\n$$n_B = \\frac{V_{obs}}{V_{m,B}}$$\nWe substitute the expressions for $V_{obs}$ and $V_{m,B}$:\n$$n_B = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{n_{true} R T_A}{P_A}\\right)}{\\left(\\frac{R T_B}{P_B}\\right)}$$\nSince $T_A = T_B = T_{STP}$, the temperature terms cancel:\n$$n_B = n_{true} \\frac{P_B}{P_A}$$\n\nThe requested fractional discrepancy in moles is $(n_B - n_A) / n_A$. Since $n_A = n_{true}$:\n$$\\frac{n_B - n_A}{n_A} = \\frac{n_B - n_{true}}{n_{true}} = \\frac{n_{true} \\frac{P_B}{P_A} - n_{true}}{n_{true}} = \\frac{P_B}{P_A} - 1$$\n\nThis demonstrates that the discrepancy in reported moles also depends only on the ratio of the standard pressures, and is independent of the amount of gas produced. The specific chemical scenario is indeed only for context.\n\nInserting the numerical values:\n$$\\frac{P_B}{P_A} - 1 = \\frac{1.00000 \\times 10^5\\,\\text{Pa}}{101325\\,\\text{Pa}} - 1 \\approx 0.986923356 - 1 = -0.013076643...$$\n\nRounded to six significant figures, the result is $-0.0130766$.\n\nThe two requested values are calculated and presented in the required order.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.0132500  -0.0130766 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2939914"}, {"introduction": "This final practice moves beyond simple single-phase systems to a more complex and realistic scenario involving gas-liquid equilibrium.
