The problem does not violate any of the criteria for invalidity. It is self-contained, consistent, and scientifically sound.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A detailed solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires a derivation starting from the kinetic theory of gases. The pressure $p$ exerted by an ideal gas containing $N$ molecules, each of mass $m$, in a container of volume $V$ is given by the relation:\n$$ p = \\frac{1}{3} \\frac{N}{V} m \\langle v^2 \\rangle $$\nwhere $\\langle v^2 \\rangle$ is the mean-squared speed of the molecules.\n\nThe problem further stipulates that the average translational kinetic energy of a molecule is determined by the equipartition theorem at an absolute temperature $T$. For a molecule with three translational degrees of freedom, this is:\n$$ \\left\\langle \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 \\right\\rangle = \\frac{3}{2} k_B T $$\nwhere $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant. This implies that the term $m \\langle v^2 \\rangle$ can be expressed in terms of temperature:\n$$ m \\langle v^2 \\rangle = 2 \\left\\langle \\frac{1}{2} m v^2 \\right\\rangle = 2 \\left( \\frac{3}{2} k_B T \\right) = 3 k_B T $$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $m \\langle v^2 \\rangle$ into the pressure equation:\n$$ p = \\frac{1}{3} \\frac{N}{V} (3 k_B T) = \\frac{N k_B T}{V} $$\nRearranging this equation gives the ideal gas equation of state in terms of the number of particles, $N$:\n$$ pV = N k_B T $$\n\nThe number of particles $N$ is related to the amount of substance $n$ (in moles) through Avogadro's constant, $N_A$:\n$$ N = n N_A $$\nSubstituting this into the equation of state yields:\n$$ pV = n N_A k_B T $$\nThe product of the two constants, $N_A$ and $k_B$, defines the universal gas constant, $R$:\n$$ R = N_A k_B $$\nThus, we arrive at the familiar molar form of the ideal gas law:\n$$ pV = nRT $$\n\nThe first task is to deduce how the equilibrium volume $V$ depends on the amount of substance $n$ when pressure $p$ and temperature $T$ are held fixed. We rearrange the ideal gas law to solve for $V$:\n$$ V = \\left( \\frac{RT}{p} \\right) n $$\nSince $R$ is a universal constant, and the problem states that $T$ and $p$ are held constant throughout the process, the term $\\frac{RT}{p}$ is a constant. Let us denote this constant by $C$:\n$$ C = \\frac{RT}{p} $$\nThe relationship is therefore:\n$$ V = Cn $$\nThis equation demonstrates that, under conditions of constant temperature and pressure, the volume of an ideal gas is directly proportional to the amount of substance. This direct proportionality is the statement of **Avogadro's law**. It explains that equal volumes of gases at the same temperature and pressure contain an equal number of moles (and thus molecules), because the ratio $\\frac{V}{n} = C$ is constant for any gas under these conditions.\n\nThe second task is to compute the fractional change in volume, $\\frac{\\Delta V}{V_i}$. The initial state is characterized by $(n_i, V_i, p, T)$, and the final state by $(n_f, V_f, p, T)$.\nFrom the derived relationship $V = n \\left( \\frac{RT}{p} \\right)$, we can write expressions for the initial and final volumes:\nInitial volume:\n$$ V_i = n_i \\frac{RT}{p} $$\nFinal volume:\n$$ V_f = n_f \\frac{RT}{p} $$\nThe problem states that the amount of substance is doubled, so $n_f = 2 n_i$. Substituting this into the expression for $V_f$:\n$$ V_f = (2 n_i) \\frac{RT}{p} = 2 \\left( n_i \\frac{RT}{p} \\right) $$\nBy comparing this with the expression for $V_i$, we see that:\n$$ V_f = 2 V_i $$\nThe change in volume, $\\Delta V$, is defined as $\\Delta V = V_f - V_i$.\n$$ \\Delta V = 2 V_i - V_i = V_i $$\nThe fractional change in volume is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta V}{V_i} = \\frac{V_i}{V_i} = 1 $$\nThe fractional change in volume is a pure number, $1$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1}$$", "id": "2924167"}, {"introduction": "While the ideal gas law provides an essential baseline, its assumptions—point-like particles and no intermolecular forces—break down for real gases, especially at high pressures or low temperatures.

The ideal-gas limit corresponds to the parameters $a \\to 0$ and $b \\to 0$. As $b \\to 0$, the packing fraction $y = nb/V$ also approaches $0$. Taking the limit of our expression for $C$:\n$$ \\lim_{a\\to 0, y\\to 0} C(T,p) = \\lim_{a\\to 0, y\\to 0} \\frac{(p b^{2} + a y^{2})(1 - y)}{p b^{2} - a y^{2}(1 - 2y)} $$\nSince $y \\to 0$, the term $(1-y) \\to 1$ and $(1-2y) \\to 1$. The terms containing $a$ vanish. The expression for $p$ must remain finite, and since $b$ is also in the term $pb^2$, we must consider the initial form before multiplying by $b^2$:\n$$ \\lim_{a\\to 0, y\\to 0} C(T,p) = \\lim_{a\\to 0, y\\to 0} \\frac{\\left(p + a \\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}\\right)(1 - y)}{p - a \\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}} + 2 a \\frac{y^{3}}{b^{2}}} = \\frac{(p + 0)(1-0)}{p - 0 + 0} = \\frac{p}{p} = 1 $$\nThis limit, $C=1$, corresponds to the ideal gas result. For an ideal gas, $pV = nRT$, so at constant $p$ and $n$, $V = (nR/p)T$, which implies $V \\propto T$. Then $(\\partial \\ln V / \\partial T)_p = (\\partial (\\ln T + \\text{const})/\\partial T)_p = 1/T$. The Charles factor becomes $C = T(1/T) = 1$.

We now compute $y_i$ and $\\sigma_{y,i}$ for each data point $(p_i, \\kappa_{T,i}, \\sigma_{\\kappa,i})$:\n- $p_1=0.2$: $y_1 = 0.2 \\times 5.03 = 1.006$; $\\sigma_{y,1} = 0.2 \\times 0.010 = 0.002$\n- $p_2=0.5$: $y_2 = 0.5 \\times 2.02 = 1.010$; $\\sigma_{y,2} = 0.5 \\times 0.004 = 0.002$\n- $p_3=1.0$: $y_3 = 1.0 \\times 1.022 = 1.022$; $\\sigma_{y,3} = 1.0 \\times 0.002 = 0.002$\n- $p_4=2.0$: $y_4 = 2.0 \\times 0.5195 = 1.039$; $\\sigma_{y,4} = 2.0 \\times 0.0010 = 0.002$\n- $p_5=3.0$: $y_5 = 3.0 \\times 0.3540 = 1.062$; $\\sigma_{y,5} = 3.0 \\times 0.000667 = 0.002001$\n- $p_6=4.0$: $y_6 = 4.0 \\times 0.26975 = 1.079$; $\\sigma_{y,6} = 4.0 \\times 0.000500 = 0.002$\n- $p_7=5.0$: $y_7 = 5.0 \\times 0.21960 = 1.098$; $\\sigma_{y,7} = 5.0 \\times 0.000400 = 0.002$\n\nThe propagated uncertainties $\\sigma_{y,i}$ are, to a very high precision, constant and equal to $0.002$.\n\nTask 3: Least-Squares Fit\nWe are to fit the transformed data $(p_i, y_i)$ to the linear model $y(p)=y_0+cp$, where $y_0$ is the intercept and $c$ is the slope. The goal is to find the best point estimate for $y_0$. The general method for such a fit is weighted least-squares (WLS), which minimizes the sum of squared weighted residuals, $\\chi^2 = \\sum_i w_i (y_i - (y_0+cp_i))^2$, where the weights are $w_i = 1/\\sigma_{y,i}^2$.\nHowever, as established in Task 2, the uncertainties $\\sigma_{y,i}$ are constant for all data points. This means the weights $w_i$ are also constant. In such a scenario, minimizing the WLS $\\chi^2$ is equivalent to minimizing the unweighted sum of squared residuals, $\\sum_i (y_i - (y_0+cp_i))^2$. Therefore, the procedure simplifies from weighted least-squares to ordinary least-squares (OLS).\n\nThe standard OLS formulas for the intercept $y_0$ and slope $c$ for a set of $N$ data points $(p_i, y_i)$ are:\n$$y_0 = \\frac{(\\sum y_i)(\\sum p_i^2) - (\\sum p_i)(\\sum p_i y_i)}{N \\sum p_i^2 - (\\sum p_i)^2}$$\n$$c = \\frac{N \\sum p_i y_i - (\\sum p_i)(\\sum y_i)}{N \\sum p_i^2 - (\\sum p_i)^2}$$\nWe require only the value of $y_0$. The number of data points is $N=7$. We compute the necessary sums from the data $(p_i, y_i)$:\n- $\\sum_{i=1}^{7} p_i = 0.2 + 0.5 + 1.0 + 2.0 + 3.0 + 4.0 + 5.0 = 15.7$\n- $\\sum_{i=1}^{7} y_i = 1.006 + 1.010 + 1.022 + 1.039 + 1.062 + 1.079 + 1.098 = 7.316$\n- $\\sum_{i=1}^{7} p_i^2 = 0.2^2 + 0.5^2 + 1.0^2 + 2.0^2 + 3.0^2 + 4.0^2 + 5.0^2 = 0.04 + 0.25 + 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 = 55.29$\n- $\\sum_{i=1}^{7} p_i y_i = (0.2)(1.006) + (0.5)(1.010) + (1.0)(1.022) + (2.0)(1.039) + (3.0)(1.062) + (4.0)(1.079) + (5.0)(1.098) = 0.2012 + 0.505 + 1.022 + 2.078 + 3.186 + 4.316 + 5.49 = 16.7982$\n\nNow, we substitute these sums into the formula for the intercept $y_0$.\nThe denominator is:\n$$D = N \\sum p_i^2 - (\\sum p_i)^2 = 7 \\times 55.29 - (15.7)^2 = 387.03 - 246.49 = 140.54$$\nThe numerator is:\n$$N_{y_0} = (\\sum y_i)(\\sum p_i^2) - (\\sum p_i)(\\sum p_i y_i) = (7.316)(55.29) - (15.7)(16.7982) = 404.50284 - 263.73174 = 140.7711$$\nThe estimate for the intercept $y_0$ is:\n$$y_0 = \\frac{N_{y_0}}{D} = \\frac{140.7711}{140.54} \\approx 1.0016444$$\n\nTask 4: Final Answer Reporting\nThe problem requires the point estimate of $y_0$ rounded to four significant figures.\n$$y_0 \\approx 1.0016444$$\nRounding this value to four significant figures gives $1.002$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.002}$$", "id": "2924179"}]}
