In the second virial framework, the deviation from volume additivity to leading order is governed by $y_A B_A + y_B B_B - B_{\\mathrm{mix}} = 2 y_A y_B\\big(\\tfrac{B_A + B_B}{2} - B_{AB}\\big)$. When the unlike interaction encoded in $B_{AB}$ equals the arithmetic mean of the like interactions $B_A$ and $B_B$, the mixture’s two-body nonideality is, to this order, indistinguishable from the linear average of the pure components, so the Amagat construction becomes exact to leading nonideal order. By contrast, Dalton’s law at common volume and temperature misses the cross contribution $2 y_A y_B B_{AB}\\,\\rho^2$ to the pressure that arises from unlike $A$–$B$ pairs; unless $B_{AB} = 0$, this cross term makes the sum of pure-component pressures differ from the true mixture pressure. For gases with similar sizes and interaction strengths (so that $B_{AB} \\approx \\tfrac{1}{2}(B_A + B_B)$ but $B_{AB} \\neq 0$), this yields an explicit scenario where Amagat’s law approximately holds while Dalton’s law fails to the same order.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.02806}$$", "id": "2933694"}]}
