It is scientifically grounded in the principles of chemical thermodynamics, well-posed with sufficient data for a unique solution, and objectively formulated. We will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires a three-part analysis: a derivation of the working equation, a numerical calculation of the molar enthalpy of vaporization, and a qualitative discussion of deviations from the idealized model.\n\nFirst, we derive the relationship between the slope of a plot of $y = \\ln(P/P^{\\circ})$ versus $x = 1/T$ and the molar enthalpy of vaporization, $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}$. We begin with the Clapeyron equation, which governs the phase coexistence curve between two phases $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dT} = \\frac{\\Delta S_m}{\\Delta V_m} = \\frac{S_{m,\\beta} - S_{m,\\alpha}}{V_{m,\\beta} - V_{m,\\alpha}}\n$$\nAt equilibrium, the molar Gibbs free energy change is zero, $\\Delta G_m = \\Delta H_m - T\\Delta S_m = 0$, which implies $\\Delta S_m = \\Delta H_m / T$. Substituting this into the Clapeyron equation gives:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dT} = \\frac{\\Delta H_m}{T \\Delta V_m}\n$$\nFor the liquid($l$)–vapor($g$) equilibrium, this becomes:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dT} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}}{T (V_{m,g} - V_{m,l})}\n$$\nWe introduce two standard assumptions for a system away from the critical point. First, the molar volume of the liquid is negligible compared to the molar volume of the gas, $V_{m,l} \\ll V_{m,g}$, so $\\Delta V_m \\approx V_{m,g}$. Second, the vapor phase behaves as an ideal gas, for which the molar volume is given by the Ideal Gas Law: $V_{m,g} = RT/P$.\nSubstituting these approximations yields the Clausius–Clapeyron equation:\n$$\n\\frac{dP}{dT} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}}{T (RT/P)} = \\frac{P \\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}}{RT^2}\n$$\nThis equation can be rearranged to $\\frac{1}{P}\\frac{dP}{dT} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}}{RT^2}$. Recognizing that $d(\\ln P) = (1/P)dP$, we have:\n$$\n\\frac{d(\\ln P)}{dT} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}}{RT^2}\n$$\nThe problem specifies a plot of $y = \\ln(P/P^{\\circ})$ versus $x = 1/T$. We seek the derivative $\\frac{dy}{dx}$. Using the chain rule for derivatives:\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{d(\\ln(P/P^{\\circ}))}{d(1/T)} = \\frac{d(\\ln P - \\ln P^{\\circ})}{d(1/T)}\n$$\nSince $P^{\\circ}$ is a constant, $d(\\ln P^{\\circ}) = 0$. Thus, we need to evaluate $\\frac{d(\\ln P)}{d(1/T)}$. We use the chain rule again:\n$$\n\\frac{d(\\ln P)}{d(1/T)} = \\frac{d(\\ln P)}{dT} \\cdot \\frac{dT}{d(1/T)}\n$$\nWe have $\\frac{d(\\ln P)}{dT} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}}{RT^2}$. For the second term, since $x=1/T$, we have $T=1/x$, and $\\frac{dT}{dx} = -1/x^2 = -T^2$.\nCombining these results:\n$$\n\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\left(\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}}{RT^2}\\right) (-T^2) = -\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}}{R}\n$$\nThis derivation shows that under the stated assumptions and the additional assumption that $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}$ is constant over the temperature range, a plot of $\\ln(P/P^{\\circ})$ versus $1/T$ is a straight line with a slope $m = -\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}}{R}$.\n\nSecond, we determine the numerical value of $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}$ using the first four data points. These points $(x,y)$ are $(1/T, \\ln(P/P^{\\circ}))$.\nThe points are:\n$P_1 = (0.0031250000, -3.1250000)$, which corresponds to $(1/320, -25/8)$.\n$P_2 = (0.0030303030, -2.7272727)$, which corresponds to $(1/330, -30/11)$.\n$P_3 = (0.0029411765, -2.3529412)$, which corresponds to $(1/340, -40/17)$.\n$P_4 = (0.0028571429, -2.0000000)$, which corresponds to $(1/350, -2)$.\nWe compute the slope $m = \\Delta y / \\Delta x$ between any two of these points. Using points $P_1$ and $P_4$:\n$$\nm = \\frac{y_4 - y_1}{x_4 - x_1} = \\frac{-2 - (-3.125)}{0.0028571429 - 0.0031250000} = \\frac{1.125}{-0.0002678571} = -4200\\ \\mathrm{K}\n$$\nThe calculation using the exact fractional forms confirms this slope is exact for all pairs among the first four points.\nFrom the derived relation $m = -\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}}{R}$, we solve for $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}$:\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}} = -mR\n$$\nSubstituting the values for the slope $m$ and the universal gas constant $R$:\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}} = -(-4200\\ \\mathrm{K}) \\times (8.314462618\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}})\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}} = 34920.743\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer in $\\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}$, rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\n\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}} = 34.920743\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}} \\approx 34.92\\ \\mathrm{kJ\\ mol^{-1}}\n$$\n\nThird, we discuss the reasons for the deviation of the two highest-temperature data points from the linear trend. The linear relationship $y = mx + c$ relies on three key assumptions: $V_{m,l} \\ll V_{m,g}$, the vapor is an ideal gas ($Z=PV/RT=1$), and $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}$ is constant with temperature. As temperature increases along the coexistence curve, these assumptions become progressively less valid.\n\nThe observed data shows that the points for higher temperatures lie above the extrapolated line from the low-temperature data. This indicates an upward curvature of the plot of $\\ln P$ vs $1/T$, which means the magnitude of the negative slope, $|m|$, decreases as temperature $T$ increases (and $1/T$ decreases).\n\nThe slope is more accurately given by the expression $\\frac{d(\\ln P)}{d(1/T)} = -\\frac{\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}}{Z R (1 - V_{m,l}/V_{m,g})}$. The deviation from linearity arises from the temperature dependence of $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}$, the compression factor $Z$, and the liquid-to-gas volume ratio $V_{m,l}/V_{m,g}$.\n\n1.  **Temperature dependence of $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}$**: This is the principal cause of deviation. The enthalpy of vaporization is not constant; it decreases as temperature increases, eventually becoming zero at the critical point. According to Kirchhoff's law, $\\frac{d(\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}})}{dT} = \\Delta C_p = C_{p, \\text{gas}} - C_{p, \\text{liquid}}$. For most substances, $C_{p, \\text{liquid}}  C_{p, \\text{gas}}$, so $\\Delta C_p$ is negative, causing $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}$ to decrease with increasing $T$. A decrease in $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}$ leads to a decrease in the slope's magnitude, causing the plot to curve upwards. This is consistent with the observed deviation.\n\n2.  **Real-gas effects ($Z \\neq 1$)**: At higher temperatures and pressures, the vapor deviates from ideal-gas behavior. For pressures that are not extreme, attractive intermolecular forces often dominate, leading to a compression factor $Z1$. This would make the denominator $Z R$ smaller and the slope magnitude $|m|$ larger, causing a downward curvature, opposite to the observed trend.\n\n3.  **Non-negligible liquid volume**: As temperature approaches the critical temperature, the molar volume of the liquid $V_{m,l}$ increases while that of the gas $V_{m,g}$ decreases. The term $(1 - V_{m,l}/V_{m,g})$ becomes significantly less than $1$. This makes the denominator smaller and the slope magnitude $|m|$ larger, also contributing to a downward curvature.\n\nThe observed upward deviation of the data points from the linear model indicates that the effect of the decreasing $\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{vap}}$ with temperature is dominant over the opposing effects of real gas behavior and non-negligible liquid volume in this particular temperature and pressure regime.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{34.92}\n$$", "id": "2951265"}, {"introduction": "After modeling a single phase boundary, the next step is to understand how different boundaries relate to one another.
