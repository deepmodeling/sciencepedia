All definitions and constants necessary for the derivation and calculation are provided. The question is a standard exercise in physical chemistry concerning the relationship between an equation of state and the virial expansion. We may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe objective is to derive an expression for the Boyle temperature, $T_B$, using the van der Waals equation of state, and then to calculate its numerical value for a specified gas. The derivation requires relating the van der Waals model to the virial expansion of the compressibility factor, $Z$.\n\nThe van der Waals equation of state is given as:\n$$ \\left(P+\\frac{a n^{2}}{V^{2}}\\right)\\left(V-n b\\right)=n R T $$\nIt is convenient to work with the molar volume, $\\bar{V} \\equiv \\frac{V}{n}$.

Our goal is to find an expansion of $Z$ in powers of pressure, $P$, in the low-pressure limit.\n\nFirst, we solve the molar van der Waals equation for pressure, $P$:\n$$ P = \\frac{R T}{\\bar{V}-b} - \\frac{a}{\\bar{V}^{2}} $$\nNow, we substitute this expression for $P$ into the definition of $Z$:\n$$ Z = \\frac{\\bar{V}}{RT} \\left( \\frac{R T}{\\bar{V}-b} - \\frac{a}{\\bar{V}^{2}} \\right) = \\frac{\\bar{V}}{\\bar{V}-b} - \\frac{a}{RT\\bar{V}} $$\nThis expression gives $Z$ as a function of molar volume, $\\bar{V}$. The low-pressure limit ($P \\to 0$) corresponds to the high molar volume limit ($\\bar{V} \\to \\infty$). In this limit, the term $\\frac{b}{\\bar{V}}$ is small. We can therefore perform a Taylor expansion of the term $\\frac{\\bar{V}}{\\bar{V}-b}$ in powers of $\\frac{1}{\\bar{V}}$.\n$$ \\frac{\\bar{V}}{\\bar{V}-b} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{b}{\\bar{V}}} $$\nUsing the geometric series expansion $(1-x)^{-1} = 1 + x + x^2 + \\dots$, which is valid for $|x|  1$, we set $x = \\frac{b}{\\bar{V}}$.

Second, the calculation of the root-mean-square deviation of experimental values from this theoretical prediction.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of the Critical Compressibility Factor $Z_c$**\n\nThe molar van der Waals equation of state is given by\n$$ \\left(P + \\frac{a}{V^2}\\right)(V - b) = RT $$\nwhere $P$ is the pressure, $V$ is the molar volume, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $R$ is the universal gas constant.

The definitions are $Z = \\frac{Pv}{RT}$, $A = \\frac{aP}{R^2T^2}$, and $B = \\frac{bP}{RT}$.\nFrom $Z$ and $B$, we find the ratio $b/v$:\n$$ \\frac{B}{Z} = \\frac{bP/RT}{Pv/RT} = \\frac{b}{v} $$\nThe first logarithmic term becomes:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{v}{v-b}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{1-b/v}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{1-B/Z}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{Z}{Z-B}\\right) $$\nThe coefficient of the second logarithmic term is transformed as:\n$$ \\frac{a}{RTb} = \\frac{aP/(R^2T^2)}{bP/(RT)} = \\frac{A}{B} $$\nThe argument of the second logarithm is transformed by expressing $v$ and $b$ in terms of $Z$ and $B$:\n$v = \\frac{ZRT}{P}$ and $b = \\frac{BRT}{P}$.\n$$ \\frac{v+\\delta_1 b}{v+\\delta_2 b} = \\frac{ZRT/P + \\delta_1 B RT/P}{ZRT/P + \\delta_2 B RT/P} = \\frac{RT/P (Z+\\delta_1 B)}{RT/P (Z+\\delta_2 B)} = \\frac{Z+\\delta_1 B}{Z+\\delta_2 B} $$\nSubstituting these expressions back into the equation for $\\ln\\phi$:\n$$ \\ln\\phi = \\ln\\left(\\frac{Z}{Z-B}\\right) + \\frac{A}{B(\\delta_2 - \\delta_1)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{Z+\\delta_1 B}{Z+\\delta_2 B}\\right) + Z - 1 - \\ln Z $$\nFinally, we simplify the expression by combining logarithmic terms:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{Z}{Z-B}\\right) - \\ln Z = (\\ln Z - \\ln(Z-B)) - \\ln Z = -\\ln(Z-B) $$\nThis yields the final closed-form expression for the fugacity coefficient:\n$$ \\ln \\phi = Z - 1 - \\ln(Z-B) + \\frac{A}{B(\\delta_2 - \\delta_1)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{Z+\\delta_1 B}{Z+\\delta_2 B}\\right) $$\nThis expression depends only on $Z$, $A$, $B$, $\\delta_1$, and $\\delta_2$, as required.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{Z - 1 - \\ln(Z-B) + \\frac{A}{B(\\delta_2 - \\delta_1)} \\ln\\left(\\frac{Z+\\delta_1 B}{Z+\\delta_2 B}\\right)} $$", "id": "2954612"}]}
