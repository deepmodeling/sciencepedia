The maximum emission flux is thus $p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T) \\sqrt{M/(2\\pi RT)}$. This flux is also scaled by the same accommodation coefficient $\\alpha$.\n$$J_{\\mathrm{evap}} = \\alpha p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T) \\sqrt{\\frac{M}{2\\pi R T}}$$\nThe net mass flux $J_{m}$ leaving the liquid is the difference between these two fluxes:\n$$J_{m} = J_{\\mathrm{evap}} - J_{\\mathrm{cond}} = \\alpha p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T) \\sqrt{\\frac{M}{2\\pi R T}} - \\alpha p_{v} \\sqrt{\\frac{M}{2\\pi R T}}$$\nFactoring out the common terms yields the final symbolic expression:\n$$J_{m} = \\alpha (p_{\\mathrm{sat}}(T) - p_{v}) \\sqrt{\\frac{M}{2\\pi R T}}$$\nThis expression is the Hertz-Knudsen-Schrage equation under the simplifying assumptions made in the problem statement.\n\nNow we evaluate this expression numerically using the provided data.
