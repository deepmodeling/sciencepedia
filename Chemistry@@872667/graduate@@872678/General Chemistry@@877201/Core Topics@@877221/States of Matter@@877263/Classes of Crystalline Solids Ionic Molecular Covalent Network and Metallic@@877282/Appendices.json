It is a standard problem in solid-state chemistry concerning the geometric properties of the fluorite and antifluorite crystal structures within the hard-sphere model. All necessary information and definitions are provided, and there are no contradictions or ambiguities. I will proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe analysis is performed for each crystal structure as specified. The variable $a$ denotes the lattice parameter of the conventional cubic unit cell. The radii of the cation and anion are $r_{+}$ and $r_{-}$, respectively.\n\n**1. Analysis of the Fluorite Structure**\n\nIn the fluorite structure, cations form a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice, and anions occupy all tetrahedral interstices.\n\nFirst, we determine the number of ions of each type within one conventional unit cell.\n- The number of cations, $N_{+}$, on an FCC lattice is $8$ corner ions $\\times \\frac{1}{8}$ contribution per ion $+ 6$ face-centered ions $\\times \\frac{1}{2}$ contribution per ion. Thus, $N_{+} = 8(\\frac{1}{8}) + 6(\\frac{1}{2}) = 1 + 3 = 4$.\n- The number of anions, $N_{-}$, is given as the total number of tetrahedral sites within the FCC unit cell, which are all occupied. So, $N_{-} = 8$.\nThe stoichiometry is therefore $4$ cations to $8$ anions, or $1:2$.\n\nNext, we establish the relationship between the lattice parameter $a$ and the ionic radii $r_{+}$ and $r_{-}$. This is determined by the condition of nearest unlike-ion contact. A cation at an FCC lattice point, for instance at the origin $(0,0,0)$, has as its nearest neighbors the anions in the tetrahedral sites. A tetrahedral site is located at fractional coordinates $(\\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{4})$ within the cube. The Cartesian coordinate is $(\\frac{1}{4}a, \\frac{1}{4}a, \\frac{1}{4}a)$. The distance $d$ between this cation and anion is the body diagonal of a small cube of side length $\\frac{a}{4}$.\n$$d = \\sqrt{(\\frac{a}{4})^2 + (\\frac{a}{4})^2 + (\\frac{a}{4})^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3a^2}{16}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}a$$\nAccording to the hard-sphere model, for nearest-neighbor contact, this distance equals the sum of the ionic radii:\n$$r_{+} + r_{-} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}a$$\nFrom this, we express $a$ in terms of the radii:\n$$a = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}(r_{+} + r_{-})$$\n\nNow, we determine the coordination numbers (CN).\n- The cation coordination number, $\\mathrm{CN}^{\\mathrm{F}}_{+}$, is the number of nearest anions surrounding a cation. A cation at an FCC lattice point is at the center of a small cube of side length $\\frac{a}{2}$. The $8$ tetrahedral sites are at the corners of this small cube (e.g., at coordinates $(\\pm \\frac{a}{4}, \\pm \\frac{a}{4}, \\pm \\frac{a}{4})$ relative to the cation). All these anions are equidistant from the cation. Therefore, the cation is coordinated by $8$ anions. $\\mathrm{CN}^{\\mathrm{F}}_{+} = 8$.\n- The anion coordination number, $\\mathrm{CN}^{\\mathrm{F}}_{-}$, is the number of nearest cations surrounding an anion. An anion is located in a tetrahedral interstice, for example at $(\\frac{1}{4}a, \\frac{1}{4}a, \\frac{1}{4}a)$. Its nearest neighbors are the four cations that form the tetrahedron. These are the cations at $(0,0,0)$, $(\\frac{1}{2}a, \\frac{1}{2}a, 0)$, $(\\frac{1}{2}a, 0, \\frac{1}{2}a)$, and $(0, \\frac{1}{2}a, \\frac{1}{2}a)$. The distance from the anion to each of these cations is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}a$, as calculated before. Thus, the anion is coordinated by $4$ cations. $\\mathrm{CN}^{\\mathrm{F}}_{-} = 4$.\n\nFinally, we derive the packing fraction for the fluorite structure, $\\phi_{\\mathrm{F}}$. The packing fraction is the total volume of spheres in the unit cell divided by the volume of the unit cell, $V_{\\text{cell}} = a^3$.\n$$V_{\\text{spheres}} = N_{+} V_{+} + N_{-} V_{-} = 4 \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r_{+}^3\\right) + 8 \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r_{-}^3\\right) = \\frac{16}{3}\\pi (r_{+}^3 + 2r_{-}^3)$$\nThe packing fraction $\\phi_{\\mathrm{F}}$ is:\n$$\\phi_{\\mathrm{F}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{spheres}}}{V_{\\text{cell}}} = \\frac{\\frac{16}{3}\\pi (r_{+}^3 + 2r_{-}^3)}{a^3}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $a$:\n$$\\phi_{\\mathrm{F}} = \\frac{\\frac{16}{3}\\pi (r_{+}^3 + 2r_{-}^3)}{\\left(\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}(r_{+} + r_{-})\\right)^3} = \\frac{\\frac{16}{3}\\pi (r_{+}^3 + 2r_{-}^3)}{\\frac{64}{3\\sqrt{3}}(r_{+} + r_{-})^3} = \\frac{16\\pi}{3} \\cdot \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{64} \\cdot \\frac{r_{+}^3 + 2r_{-}^3}{(r_{+} + r_{-})^3}$$\n$$\\phi_{\\mathrm{F}} = \\frac{\\pi\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\frac{r_{+}^3 + 2r_{-}^3}{(r_{+} + r_{-})^3}$$\n\n**2. Analysis of the Antifluorite Structure**\n\nIn the antifluorite structure, the roles of anions and cations are reversed. Anions form the FCC lattice, and cations occupy all tetrahedral interstices.\n\nThe number of ions per unit cell are:\n- Anions on the FCC lattice: $N_{-} = 4$.\n- Cations in the tetrahedral sites: $N_{+} = 8$.\nThe stoichiometry is $8$ cations to $4$ anions, or $2:1$.\n\nThe geometric relationship for nearest unlike-ion contact remains the same, as it depends only on the distance between an FCC lattice site and an adjacent tetrahedral site. Thus:\n$$r_{+} + r_{-} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}a \\quad \\implies \\quad a = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}(r_{+} + r_{-})$$\nNote that $r_{+}$ is now the radius of the ion in the tetrahedral site and $r_{-}$ is the radius of the ion on the FCC lattice site.\n\nThe coordination numbers are inverted relative to the fluorite structure.\n- The cation coordination number, $\\mathrm{CN}^{\\mathrm{AF}}_{+}$, corresponds to the ion in the tetrahedral site. As determined for the anion in the fluorite structure, this site is surrounded by $4$ lattice points. Therefore, $\\mathrm{CN}^{\\mathrm{AF}}_{+} = 4$.\n- The anion coordination number, $\\mathrm{CN}^{\\mathrm{AF}}_{-}$, corresponds to the ion on the FCC lattice site. As determined for the cation in the fluorite structure, this site is surrounded by $8$ tetrahedral sites. Therefore, $\\mathrm{CN}^{\\mathrm{AF}}_{-} = 8$.\n\nThe packing fraction for the antifluorite structure, $\\phi_{\\mathrm{AF}}$, is calculated similarly. The volume of the unit cell is the same function of radii. The total volume of spheres is:\n$$V_{\\text{spheres}} = N_{+} V_{+} + N_{-} V_{-} = 8 \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r_{+}^3\\right) + 4 \\left(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r_{-}^3\\right) = \\frac{16}{3}\\pi (2r_{+}^3 + r_{-}^3)$$\nThe packing fraction $\\phi_{\\mathrm{AF}}$ is:\n$$\\phi_{\\mathrm{AF}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{spheres}}}{V_{\\text{cell}}} = \\frac{\\frac{16}{3}\\pi (2r_{+}^3 + r_{-}^3)}{a^3} = \\frac{\\frac{16}{3}\\pi (2r_{+}^3 + r_{-}^3)}{\\frac{64}{3\\sqrt{3}}(r_{+} + r_{-})^3}$$\n$$\\phi_{\\mathrm{AF}} = \\frac{\\pi\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\frac{2r_{+}^3 + r_{-}^3}{(r_{+} + r_{-})^3}$$\n\n**3.
