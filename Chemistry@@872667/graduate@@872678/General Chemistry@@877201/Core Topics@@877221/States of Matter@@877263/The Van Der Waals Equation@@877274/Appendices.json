A full analysis will be performed.\n\n**Derivation of the Maxwell Equal-Area Construction**\n\nFor a single-component system, the chemical potential $\\mu$ is identical to the molar Gibbs free energy $g$. The condition for phase equilibrium between a liquid phase ($l$) and a vapor phase ($v$) at a given temperature $T$ and pressure $P$ is the equality of their chemical potentials.\n$$\n\\mu_{l}(T, P_{\\mathrm{eq}}) = \\mu_{v}(T, P_{\\mathrm{eq}})\n$$\nor equivalently,\n$$\ng_{l}(T, P_{\\mathrm{eq}}) = g_{v}(T, P_{\\mathrm{eq}})\n$$\nThis implies that the change in molar Gibbs free energy between the two states is zero: $\\Delta g = g_{v} - g_{l} = 0$.\n\nThe fundamental thermodynamic relation for the molar Gibbs free energy is $dg = -s\\,dT + v\\,dP$, where $s$ is the molar entropy. At constant temperature $T$, this simplifies to $dg = v\\,dP$. Integrating this relation between the two saturation points $(P_{\\mathrm{eq}}, v_{l})$ and $(P_{\\mathrm{eq}}, v_{v})$ is not useful, as the pressure is constant.\n\nInstead, we consider the molar Helmholtz free energy, $a$, for which the fundamental relation is $da = -s\\,dT - P\\,dv$. At constant temperature $T$, this gives $da = -P\\,dv$. We can integrate this expression along the path defined by the van der Waals isotherm $P(v;T)$ from volume $v_{l}$ to $v_{v}$.\n$$\na(T, v_{v}) - a(T, v_{l}) = \\int_{v_{l}}^{v_{v}} da = -\\int_{v_{l}}^{v_{v}} P(v;T)\\,dv\n$$\nNext, we relate the molar Gibbs and Helmholtz free energies using the definition $g = a + Pv$. The equilibrium condition $g_{v} = g_{l}$ can be written as:\n$$\na(T, v_{v}) + P_{\\mathrm{eq}}v_{v} = a(T, v_{l}) + P_{\\mathrm{eq}}v_{l}\n$$\nRearranging gives:\n$$\na(T, v_{v}) - a(T, v_{l}) = -P_{\\mathrm{eq}}(v_{v} - v_{l})\n$$\nEquating the two expressions for the change in Helmholtz free energy yields:\n$$\n-\\int_{v_{l}}^{v_{v}} P(v;T)\\,dv = -P_{\\mathrm{eq}}(v_{v} - v_{l})\n$$\n$$\n\\int_{v_{l}}^{v_{v}} P(v;T)\\,dv = P_{\\mathrm{eq}}(v_{v} - v_{l})\n$$\nThis equation states that the area under the vdW isotherm from $v_{l}$ to $v_{v}$ is equal to the area of the rectangle of height $P_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ and width $(v_{v} - v_{l})$. We can rewrite this in the more common \"equal-area\" form:\n$$\n\\int_{v_{l}}^{v_{v}} P(v;T)\\,dv - P_{\\mathrm{eq}}(v_{v} - v_{l}) = 0\n$$\nSince $P_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ is a constant, we can write $P_{\\mathrm{eq}}(v_{v} - v_{l}) = \\int_{v_{l}}^{v_{v}} P_{\\mathrm{eq}}\\,dv$. Substituting this into the equation gives:\n$$\n\\int_{v_{l}}^{v_{v}} P(v;T)\\,dv - \\int_{v_{l}}^{v_{v}} P_{\\mathrm{eq}}\\,dv = 0 \\implies \\int_{v_{l}}^{v_{v}} [P(v;T) - P_{\\mathrm{eq}}]\\,dv = 0\n$$\nThis is the mathematical statement of the Maxwell equal-area construction.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A.** This statement asserts the existence of a unique set of equilibrium parameters $(P_{\\mathrm{eq}}, v_{l}, v_{v})$ for a given subcritical temperature $T$, satisfying the condition $\\int_{v_{l}}^{v_{v}}[P(v;T)-P_{\\mathrm{eq}}]\\,dv=0$.

It correctly states that integrating between the coexistence volumes $v_{l}$ and $v_{v}$ leads to the area condition. This is precisely the logic followed in the derivation above.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C.** This option proposes a change of variables from molar volume $v$ to number density $\\rho=1/v$. Let us perform this change of variables on the correct integral form:\n$$\n\\int_{v_{l}}^{v_{v}} [P(v;T) - P_{\\mathrm{eq}}]\\,dv = 0\n$$\nWith $v=1/\\rho$, we have $dv = -1/\\rho^2 d\\rho$. The limits of integration become $\\rho_{l}=1/v_{l}$ and $\\rho_{v}=1/v_{v}$. Since $v_{l} < v_{v}$, we have $\\rho_{l} > \\rho_{v}$. The transformed integral is:\n$$\n\\int_{\\rho_{l}}^{\\rho_{v}} [P(\\rho;T) - P_{\\mathrm{eq}}] \\left(-\\frac{1}{\\rho^2}\\right) d\\rho = \\int_{\\rho_{v}}^{\\rho_{l}} \\frac{P(\\rho;T) - P_{\\mathrm{eq}}}{\\rho^2} d\\rho = 0\n$$\nThe integral presented in option C, $\\int_{\\rho_{v}}^{\\rho_{l}}[P(\\rho;T)-P_{\\mathrm{eq}}]\\,d\\rho = 0$, is missing the Jacobian factor $1/\\rho^2$. The physical condition is about equality of certain thermodynamic integrals, not geometric areas in arbitrary coordinate representations. The statement is mathematically incorrect.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D.** This option claims the integration limits are the spinodal volumes, $v_{s}^{\\pm}$, where $(\\partial P/\\partial v)_{T}=0$. The spinodal points are the local extrema of the isotherm and define the boundary of mechanical instability. The coexistence volumes, $v_{l}$ and $v_{v}$, lie in the metastable regions where $(\\partial P/\\partial v)_{T}<0$. Only at the critical point $(T=T_{\\mathrm{c}})$ do the coexisting volumes and the spinodal volumes coincide ($v_l = v_v = v_c = v_s^{\\pm}$). For any subcritical temperature $T<T_{\\mathrm{c}}$, the coexistence volumes $v_l$ and $v_v$ are distinct from the spinodal volumes.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**E.** This option presents an alternative formulation involving a closed-loop integral representing work. The loop consists of traversing the vdW isotherm from $v_{l}$ to $v_{v}$ and returning from $v_{v}$ to $v_{l}$ along the isobar $P=P_{\\mathrm{eq}}$.
