It is a well-posed, scientifically grounded problem that requires the application of standard geometric principles to established physical models. There are no flaws, ambiguities, or contradictions.\n\nWe now proceed with the solution.\n\nThe packing fraction, denoted by $\\eta$, is defined as the ratio of the volume occupied by the atoms within a unit cell to the total volume of the unit cell. For a cubic cell of edge length $a$, the volume is $V_{\\text{cell}} = a^3$. If there are $N$ atoms per conventional unit cell and each atom is a sphere of radius $r$, the volume of one atom is $V_{\\text{atom}} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$. The packing fraction is therefore given by the formula:\n$$ \\eta = \\frac{N \\cdot V_{\\text{atom}}}{V_{\\text{cell}}} = \\frac{N \\left( \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3 \\right)}{a^3} $$\nOur task is to determine $N$ and the relationship between $r$ and $a$ for each of the three cubic structures.\n\n1.  **Simple Cubic (SC) Lattice**\n    For the SC lattice, atoms are located only at the $8$ corners of the cube. Each corner atom is shared by $8$ adjacent unit cells. Therefore, the number of atoms per conventional unit cell is:\n    $$ N_{\\text{SC}} = 8 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = 1 $$\n    In the SC structure, the nearest-neighboring atoms are along the edges of the cube. The distance between the centers of two nearest-neighbor atoms is equal to the lattice constant, $a$. The problem states that this distance is $2r$. Thus, we have the relation:\n    $$ a = 2r \\implies r = \\frac{a}{2} $$\n    Substituting $N_{\\text{SC}} = 1$ and $r = a/2$ into the general packing fraction formula:\n    $$ \\eta_{\\text{SC}} = \\frac{1 \\cdot \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^3}{a^3} = \\frac{\\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\frac{a^3}{8}}{a^3} = \\frac{4\\pi}{24} = \\frac{\\pi}{6} $$\n\n2.  **Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) Lattice**\n    For the BCC lattice, atoms are located at the $8$ corners of the cube and one atom is at the geometric center of the cube. The number of atoms per conventional unit cell is:\n    $$ N_{\\text{BCC}} = \\left(8 \\times \\frac{1}{8}\\right) + 1 = 2 $$\n    In the BCC structure, the nearest-neighboring atoms are the corner atom and the body-center atom. These atoms touch along the body diagonal of the cube. The length of the body diagonal is $\\sqrt{a^2 + a^2 + a^2} = a\\sqrt{3}$. This length spans two atomic radii (one from each corner atom) and one atomic diameter (from the central atom), so its length must be $4r$. Thus, we have the relation:\n    $$ a\\sqrt{3} = 4r \\implies r = \\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{4} $$\n    Substituting $N_{\\text{BCC}} = 2$ and $r = a\\sqrt{3}/4$ into the formula:\n    $$ \\eta_{\\text{BCC}} = \\frac{2 \\cdot \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)^3}{a^3} = \\frac{\\frac{8}{3}\\pi \\frac{a^3 \\cdot 3\\sqrt{3}}{64}}{a^3} = \\frac{24\\pi\\sqrt{3}}{192} = \\frac{\\pi\\sqrt{3}}{8} $$\n\n3.  **Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) Lattice**\n    For the FCC lattice, atoms are located at the $8$ corners of the cube and at the center of each of the $6$ faces. Each face-centered atom is shared by $2$ adjacent cells. The number of atoms per conventional unit cell is:\n    $$ N_{\\text{FCC}} = \\left(8 \\times \\frac{1}{8}\\right) + \\left(6 \\times \\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 1 + 3 = 4 $$\n    In the FCC structure, the nearest-neighboring atoms touch along the face diagonal of the cube. The length of the face diagonal is $\\sqrt{a^2 + a^2} = a\\sqrt{2}$. This length spans two atomic radii and one atomic diameter, so its length must be $4r$. Thus:\n    $$ a\\sqrt{2} = 4r \\implies r = \\frac{a\\sqrt{2}}{4} $$\n    Substituting $N_{\\text{FCC}} = 4$ and $r = a\\sqrt{2}/4$ into the formula:\n    $$ \\eta_{\\text{FCC}} = \\frac{4 \\cdot \\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{a\\sqrt{2}}{4}\\right)^3}{a^3} = \\frac{\\frac{16}{3}\\pi \\frac{a^3 \\cdot 2\\sqrt{2}}{64}}{a^3} = \\frac{32\\pi\\sqrt{2}}{192} = \\frac{\\pi\\sqrt{2}}{6} $$\n    This is also commonly written as $\\frac{\\pi}{3\\sqrt{2}}$.\n\nThe calculated packing fractions for the SC, BCC, and FCC lattices are $\\frac{\\pi}{6}$, $\\frac{\\pi\\sqrt{3}}{8}$, and $\\frac{\\pi\\sqrt{2}}{6}$, respectively.

The derivation will proceed by first establishing the relationship between the cubic lattice parameter, $a$, and the atomic radius, $r$. Subsequently, we will identify the two-dimensional ($2$D) lattice structure within the $(111)$ plane, determine the properties of its primitive cell, and calculate the number of atoms per such cell.\n\nIn the FCC structure, atoms are located at the corners and the centers of each face of the cubic unit cell. The hard-sphere model dictates that atoms are in contact along the directions of closest packing. For the FCC lattice, this direction is the face diagonal. The length of the face diagonal is given by the Pythagorean theorem as $\\sqrt{a^2 + a^2} = a\\sqrt{2}$. Along this diagonal, there is half an atom at one corner (radius $r$), one full atom at the face center (diameter $2r$), and another half an atom at the opposite corner (radius $r$). The total length occupied by these spheres in contact is therefore $r + 2r + r = 4r$. Equating the geometric length of the diagonal with the sum of the atomic radii yields the fundamental relationship for the FCC lattice:\n$$a\\sqrt{2} = 4r$$\nFrom this, we express the lattice parameter $a$ in terms of the atomic radius $r$:\n$$a = \\frac{4r}{\\sqrt{2}} = 2\\sqrt{2}r$$\n\nNext, we analyze the geometry of the $(111)$ crystallographic plane. The atoms whose centers lie within this plane form a two-dimensional hexagonal (or triangular) Bravais lattice. This is the most densely packed plane in the FCC structure. To find the planar density, we must determine the area of the 2D primitive cell of this lattice. The primitive cell is a rhombus whose vertices are occupied by atoms. The side length of this rhombus, $s$, is equal to the shortest distance between atomic centers in the plane. This distance is the nearest-neighbor distance in the FCC lattice, which is half the length of the face diagonal:\n$$s = \\frac{a\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}}$$\nUsing our expression for $a$ in terms of $r$, we find $s = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}r}{\\sqrt{2}} = 2r$. This confirms that the atoms in the plane are in contact, with a center-to-center distance of $2r$.\n\nThe primitive cell of this 2D hexagonal lattice is a rhombus defined by two primitive vectors of length $s=2r$. To calculate the area of this rhombus, we need the angle between these vectors. In the hexagonal lattice, the internal angles of the primitive rhombus are $60^\\circ$ and $120^\\circ$. We can rigorously derive this by considering the dot product of the primitive vectors. Let the atom at the center of the $xy$ face, with coordinates $(\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}, 0)$, be the origin of our 2D cell. Two primitive vectors, $\\vec{v}_1$ and $\\vec{v}_2$, can be defined as vectors connecting this atom to two of its nearest neighbors, located at $(\\frac{a}{2}, 0, \\frac{a}{2})$ and $(0, \\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2})$.\n$$\\vec{v}_1 = (0, -\\frac{a}{2}, \\frac{a}{2}) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\vec{v}_2 = (-\\frac{a}{2}, 0, \\frac{a}{2})$$\nThe angle $\\theta$ between these vectors is found from the dot product:\n$$\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\vec{v}_1 \\cdot \\vec{v}_2}{|\\vec{v}_1||\\vec{v}_2|} = \\frac{0 + 0 + a^2/4}{(a/\\sqrt{2})(a/\\sqrt{2})} = \\frac{a^2/4}{a^2/2} = \\frac{1}{2}$$\nThis gives $\\theta = \\arccos(\\frac{1}{2}) = 60^\\circ$. The area of the primitive cell, $A_{cell}$, is the area of a rhombus with side length $s = 2r$ and an internal angle of $60^\\circ$:\n$$A_{cell} = s^2 \\sin(60^\\circ) = (2r)^2 \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) = 4r^2 \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) = 2\\sqrt{3}r^2$$\n\nThe number of atoms per primitive cell, $N_{atoms}$, for any Bravais lattice is, by definition, exactly one.
