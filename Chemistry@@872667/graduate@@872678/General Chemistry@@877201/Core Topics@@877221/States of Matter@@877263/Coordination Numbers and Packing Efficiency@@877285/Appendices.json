Compute the packing fraction.\n\n2.  **Validation Verdict**: The problem is **valid**. It is scientifically grounded in established principles of crystallography, is well-posed with sufficient and consistent data, and is expressed in objective, precise terms. It is a fundamental problem that tests core concepts without fallacy or ambiguity.\n\nWe will now proceed with the solution in three parts as requested.\n\n**Part 1: Relation between Atomic Radius ($r$) and Lattice Parameter ($a$)**\n\nThe body-centered cubic (bcc) unit cell is a cube of side length $a$ with atoms at each of the $8$ corners and one atom at the geometric center of the cube. Under the hard-sphere model, atoms are assumed to be in contact with their nearest neighbors. In the bcc structure, the corner atoms do not touch each other along the edges or face diagonals. Contact occurs along the body diagonal of the cube, which connects opposite corners and passes through the central atom.\n\nThe length of the body diagonal, $d_{body}$, of a cube with edge length $a$ is found using the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions:\n$$d_{body} = \\sqrt{a^2 + a^2 + a^2} = \\sqrt{3a^2} = a\\sqrt{3}$$\nThis diagonal passes through the center of the atom at one corner (radius $r$), the full diameter of the central atom (diameter $2r$), and the center of the atom at the opposite corner (radius $r$). The total length along this line occupied by the touching spheres is therefore:\n$$d_{body} = r + 2r + r = 4r$$\nBy equating the geometric length of the body diagonal with the length required for the hard spheres to touch, we establish the fundamental relationship for the bcc structure:\n$$4r = a\\sqrt{3}$$\nThis gives the atomic radius $r$ as a function of the lattice parameter $a$:\n$$r = \\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{4}$$\nFor tungsten, the given lattice parameter is $a = 3.1652\\ \\text{\\AA}$. Substituting this value into the derived relation yields the atomic radius:\n$$r = \\frac{(3.1652\\ \\text{\\AA})\\sqrt{3}}{4}$$\nNumerically, this is calculated as:\n$$r \\approx \\frac{(3.1652)(1.7320508)}{4}\\ \\text{\\AA} \\approx \\frac{5.48303}{4}\\ \\text{\\AA} \\approx 1.370757\\ \\text{\\AA}$$\nAs requested, rounding this value to four significant figures gives:\n$$r \\approx 1.371\\ \\text{\\AA}$$\n\n**Part 2: Coordination Number and Nearest-Neighbor Distance**\n\nThe coordination number (CN) is defined as the number of nearest neighbors to a given atom in the crystal lattice. By symmetry, every atom in the bcc lattice is equivalent, so we may analyze the environment of any single atom. It is most convenient to consider the atom at the body center of the unit cell, located at fractional coordinates $(\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2})$.\n\nThe neighbors to this central atom are the $8$ atoms located at the corners of the same unit cell. The corner positions are $(0, 0, 0)$, $(1, 0, 0)$, $(0, 1, 0)$, $(0, 0, 1)$, $(1, 1, 0)$, $(1, 0, 1)$, $(0, 1, 1)$, and $(1, 1, 1)$. The distance, $d_{nn}$, from the central atom to any of these corner atoms is identical. Let us calculate this distance to the corner at $(0, 0, 0)$:\n$$d_{nn} = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{2}a - 0\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}a - 0\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{2}a - 0\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a^2}{4} + \\frac{a^2}{4} + \\frac{a^2}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3a^2}{4}} = \\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2}$$\nThis is the nearest-neighbor distance. According to the hard-sphere model, this distance must be equal to the sum of two atomic radii, $2r$. Using our result from Part 1, $r = \\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{4}$, we can verify this:\n$$2r = 2\\left(\\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right) = \\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2}$$\nThis confirms the consistency of the geometry. Since the central atom is equidistant from all $8$ corner atoms, it has $8$ nearest neighbors.\n\nTo confirm that these are indeed the *nearest* neighbors, we must identify the next-nearest neighbors and show their distance is greater. The next-nearest neighbors to the central atom are the central atoms of the $6$ adjacent unit cells, which are located at positions such as $(\\frac{3}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2})$, $(-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{1}{2})$, etc. The distance to these atoms is simply the lattice parameter, $a$.\nAlternatively, considering the atom at the origin $(0,0,0)$, its next-nearest neighbors are the atoms at the corners of its own cell that it does not touch, such as the one at $(1,0,0)$. The distance is $a$.\nWe compare the nearest-neighbor distance $d_{nn}$ with the next-nearest-neighbor distance $d_{nnn}$:\n$$d_{nn} = \\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\approx 0.866a$$\n$$d_{nnn} = a$$\nSince $d_{nn}  d_{nnn}$, the set of $8$ neighbors at distance $\\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ is exhaustive. Therefore, the coordination number for the bcc structure is $8$.\n\n**Part 3: Packing Fraction**\n\nThe packing fraction (PF), or atomic packing factor (APF), is the fraction of the total volume of the unit cell that is occupied by atoms. It is defined as:\n$$PF = \\frac{N \\times V_{atom}}{V_{cell}}$$\nwhere $N$ is the number of atoms per unit cell, $V_{atom}$ is the volume of a single atom, and $V_{cell}$ is the volume of the unit cell.\n\nFor the bcc structure, the number of atoms per unit cell, $N$, is calculated as:\n- $1$ atom at the body center (fully contained within the cell): $1 \\times 1 = 1$\n- $8$ atoms at the corners, each shared by $8$ adjacent cells: $8 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = 1$\nTotal atoms per unit cell: $N = 1 + 1 = 2$.\n\nThe volume of the cubic unit cell is $V_{cell} = a^3$.\nThe volume of a single spherical atom is $V_{atom} = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3$.\n\nSubstituting these into the packing fraction formula gives its dependence on $a$ and $r$:\n$$PF = \\frac{2 \\times \\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3}{a^3} = \\frac{\\frac{8}{3}\\pi r^3}{a^3}$$\nTo obtain a dimensionless value, we use the relationship $r = \\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{4}$ derived in Part 1 to eliminate the variables $a$ and $r$:\n$$PF = \\frac{\\frac{8}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{a\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)^3}{a^3} = \\frac{\\frac{8}{3}\\pi \\left(\\frac{a^3 (\\sqrt{3})^3}{4^3}\\right)}{a^3}$$\nThe $a^3$ terms cancel, as expected for a structural constant:\n$$PF = \\frac{8\\pi}{3} \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{64} = \\frac{24\\pi\\sqrt{3}}{192} = \\frac{\\pi\\sqrt{3}}{8}$$\nThis is the exact analytical expression for the packing fraction of a bcc lattice.\n\nThe consistency of this result with the coordination number analysis is qualitative. A higher coordination number generally corresponds to a more efficient packing of spheres. The bcc structure, with $CN=8$, is more densely packed than the simple cubic structure ($CN=6$, $PF = \\frac{\\pi}{6} \\approx 0.5236$), but less dense than the close-packed structures (fcc and hcp, with $CN=12$, $PF = \\frac{\\pi}{3\\sqrt{2}} \\approx 0.7405$). The calculated PF for bcc fits logically within this hierarchy.\n\nFinally, we compute the numerical value of the packing fraction and round it to five significant figures as requested:\n$$PF = \\frac{\\pi\\sqrt{3}}{8} \\approx \\frac{(3.14159265...)(1.73205081...)}{8} \\approx \\frac{5.441397...}{8} \\approx 0.680174...$$\nRounding to five significant figures gives:\n$$PF \\approx 0.68017$$\nThis completes the required analysis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.68017}$$", "id": "2930972"}, {"introduction": "Having analyzed a simple metallic lattice, we now turn to a fundamentally different type of structure: the covalent network of diamond cubic silicon.

The problem states that nearest-neighbor atoms are in point contact. We must therefore find the distance between nearest neighbors in the diamond cubic structure.\n\nThe basis atoms are located at fractional coordinates $(0,0,0)$ and $(\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4})$ relative to each FCC lattice point. Let us consider the atom associated with the basis vector $(0,0,0)$ at the corner of the cell, which has Cartesian coordinates $\\mathbf{P}_1 = (0, 0, 0)$. One of its nearest neighbors is the atom associated with the basis vector $(\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4})$ relative to the same corner lattice point. The coordinates of this neighbor are $\\mathbf{P}_2 = (\\frac{1}{4}a, \\frac{1}{4}a, \\frac{1}{4}a)$.\n\nThe distance $d$ between these two nearest-neighbor atoms is the magnitude of the vector connecting them:\n$$\nd = ||\\mathbf{P}_2 - \\mathbf{P}_1|| = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{1}{4}a - 0\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{4}a - 0\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{4}a - 0\\right)^2}\n$$\n$$\nd = \\sqrt{3 \\left(\\frac{a}{4}\\right)^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}a}{4}\n$$\nThis distance is along the body diagonal of a small cube of side length $\\frac{a}{4}$.
