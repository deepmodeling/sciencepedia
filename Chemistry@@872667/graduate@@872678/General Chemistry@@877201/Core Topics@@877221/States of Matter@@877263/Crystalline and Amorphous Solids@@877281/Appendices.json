We may therefore proceed directly to the solution.\n\nThe task is to derive a relationship between a real-space coherence length, $\\xi$, and the width of a corresponding feature in reciprocal space, $\\Delta Q$, and then to use this relationship to compute a dimensionless ratio. The fundamental principle connecting these two quantities is the Fourier transform. The structure factor, $S(Q)$, is related to the real-space pair correlation function, $g(r)$, through a Fourier transform. A general property of the Fourier transform is that a function localized in one space (e.g., real space) over a characteristic width will be delocalized in the conjugate space (e.g., reciprocal space) with a width that is inversely proportional to the original width.\n\nThe first sharp diffraction peak (FSDP) in $S(Q)$ is a signature of medium-range order in the glass structure. This order consists of correlations that persist over a length scale larger than the nearest-neighbor distance but which decay over a finite distance. This finite correlation distance is the coherence length, $\\xi$. The finite width, $\\Delta Q$, of the FSDP is a direct consequence of the finite value of $\\xi$.\n\nA rigorous derivation can be complex, depending on the assumed functional form of the decaying correlations. However, a robust and widely used approximate relation can be derived by analogy with X-ray diffraction from nanocrystals, a phenomenon described by the Scherrer equation. This analogy is appropriate because, in both cases, a diffraction peak is broadened due to the finite spatial extent of a periodic structure.\n\nThe Scherrer equation relates the size of a crystalline domain, $\\tau$, to the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of a Bragg peak, $\\beta$, measured in radians of the scattering angle $2\\theta$:\n$$\n\\tau = \\frac{K \\lambda}{\\beta \\cos \\theta}\n$$\nHere, $\\lambda$ is the wavelength of the radiation, $\\theta$ is the Bragg angle, and $K$ is a dimensionless shape factor, typically of order unity ($K \\approx 1$).\n\nWe must re-express this equation in terms of the scattering vector magnitude, $Q$, which is a more fundamental variable than $\\theta$. The relationship is given by:\n$$\nQ = \\frac{4\\pi \\sin\\theta}{\\lambda}\n$$\nThe width of the peak in $Q$-space, $\\Delta Q$, is related to the width in angle, $\\beta = \\Delta(2\\theta)$, by considering the differential:\n$$\n\\frac{dQ}{d\\theta} = \\frac{4\\pi \\cos\\theta}{\\lambda}\n$$\nFor a small peak width, we can approximate the relationship as $\\Delta Q \\approx \\frac{dQ}{d\\theta} \\Delta\\theta$.
