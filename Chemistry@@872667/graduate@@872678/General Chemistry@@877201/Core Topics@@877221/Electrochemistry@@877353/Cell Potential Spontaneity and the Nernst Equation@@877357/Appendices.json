The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information. It is therefore deemed valid.\n\nThe fundamental relationship between the standard Gibbs free energy change, $\\Delta G^\\circ$, and the standard cell potential, $E^\\circ_{\\text{cell}}$, is given by the equation:\n$$ \\Delta G^\\circ = -nFE^\\circ_{\\text{cell}} $$\nwhere $n$ is the number of moles of electrons transferred in the balanced redox reaction, and $F$ is the Faraday constant. A redox reaction is spontaneous under standard conditions if its standard Gibbs free energy change is negative, $\\Delta G^\\circ  0$. From the equation, this implies that the standard cell potential, $E^\\circ_{\\text{cell}}$, must be positive.\n\nAn overall redox reaction consists of a reduction half-reaction (at the cathode) and an oxidation half-reaction (at the anode). To ensure a positive $E^\\circ_{\\text{cell}}$, the half-reaction with the higher (more positive) standard reduction potential will proceed as the reduction, and the half-reaction with the lower (less positive) standard reduction potential will be reversed to proceed as the oxidation.\n\nComparing the two provided standard reduction potentials, we have $E^\\circ_1 = +1.700\\ \\mathrm{V}$ and $E^\\circ_2 = +0.5355\\ \\mathrm{V}$. Since $E^\\circ_1  E^\\circ_2$, the cerium reaction will be the reduction and the iodine reaction will be the oxidation.\n\nThe half-reactions for the spontaneous cell are:\nReduction (Cathode): $\\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}(aq) + \\mathrm{e}^{-} \\to \\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}(aq)$, with $E^\\circ_{\\text{red}} = E^\\circ_1 = +1.700\\ \\mathrm{V}$.\nOxidation (Anode): $2\\,\\mathrm{I}^{-}(aq) \\to \\mathrm{I}_{2}(s) + 2\\,\\mathrm{e}^{-}$.\n\nAs per the problem's constraint, we will use the additivity of Gibbs free energy. The standard Gibbs free energy for each half-reaction is calculated using $\\Delta G^\\circ = -nFE^\\circ$.\nFor the reduction half-reaction as written, one mole of electrons is transferred ($n_{\\text{red}} = 1$):\n$$ \\Delta G^\\circ_{\\text{red}} = -(1)FE^\\circ_1 = -F(+1.700\\ \\mathrm{V}) $$\nFor the oxidation half-reaction, we must use the potential for the oxidation process. The standard oxidation potential is the negative of the standard reduction potential, $E^\\circ_{\\text{ox}} = -E^\\circ_2 = -0.5355\\ \\mathrm{V}$. In this half-reaction, two moles of electrons are transferred ($n_{\\text{ox}} = 2$):\n$$ \\Delta G^\\circ_{\\text{ox}} = -(2)FE^\\circ_{\\text{ox}} = -(2)F(-E^\\circ_2) = 2FE^\\circ_2 = 2F(+0.5355\\ \\mathrm{V}) $$\n\nTo obtain the balanced overall reaction, the number of electrons must be conserved. The reduction half-reaction involves $1$ electron, while the oxidation involves $2$ electrons.

Therefore, the $\\Delta G^\\circ$ for the balanced cathode reaction is twice the value for the reaction with one electron:\n$$ \\Delta G^\\circ_{\\text{red, balanced}} = 2 \\times \\Delta G^\\circ_{\\text{red}} = 2(-FE^\\circ_1) = -2FE^\\circ_1 $$\nThe $\\Delta G^\\circ$ for the anode reaction is unchanged, as the reaction already involves $2$ electrons.\n\nThe overall balanced spontaneous reaction is the sum of the balanced half-reactions:\n$$ 2\\,\\mathrm{Ce}^{4+}(aq) + 2\\,\\mathrm{I}^{-}(aq) \\to 2\\,\\mathrm{Ce}^{3+}(aq) + \\mathrm{I}_{2}(s) $$\nThe total number of moles of electrons transferred in this overall reaction is $n=2$.\n\nThe standard Gibbs free energy for the overall reaction, $\\Delta G^\\circ_{\\text{cell}}$, is the sum of the Gibbs free energies of the balanced half-reactions:\n$$ \\Delta G^\\circ_{\\text{cell}} = \\Delta G^\\circ_{\\text{red, balanced}} + \\Delta G^\\circ_{\\text{ox}} = -2FE^\\circ_1 + 2FE^\\circ_2 = -2F(E^\\circ_1 - E^\\circ_2) $$\nNow, we relate this to the standard cell potential, $E^\\circ_{\\text{cell}}$, using the fundamental equation for the overall reaction where $n=2$:\n$$ \\Delta G^\\circ_{\\text{cell}} = -nFE^\\circ_{\\text{cell}} = -2FE^\\circ_{\\text{cell}} $$\nBy equating the two expressions for $\\Delta G^\\circ_{\\text{cell}}$, we get:\n$$ -2FE^\\circ_{\\text{cell}} = -2F(E^\\circ_1 - E^\\circ_2) $$\nDividing by $-2F$ demonstrates that the standard cell potential is the difference between the standard reduction potentials, without multiplying the potentials by any stoichiometric coefficients:\n$$ E^\\circ_{\\text{cell}} = E^\\circ_1 - E^\\circ_2 = E^\\circ_{\\text{cathode}} - E^\\circ_{\\text{anode}} $$\nThis rigorous derivation respects the constraint to not multiply potentials, by showing that the stoichiometric factors apply to the extensive quantity $\\Delta G^\\circ$ but cancel out for the intensive quantity $E^\\circ$.\n\nFinally, we substitute the numerical values:\n$$ E^\\circ_{\\text{cell}} = (+1.700\\ \\mathrm{V}) - (+0.5355\\ \\mathrm{V}) = 1.1645\\ \\mathrm{V} $$\nThe problem requires the result to be rounded to four significant figures.

The cell EMF, denoted by $E$, is given by the difference in the electrode potentials of the right and left compartments: $E=E_{\\text{right}} - E_{\\text{left}}$.\n\nLet us first address Task 1: Derivation of the EMF expression.\n\nThe right compartment contains a silver electrode in a solution of $\\mathrm{AgNO}_{3}$. The half-reaction is:\n$$ \\mathrm{Ag}^{+}(aq,\\text{right}) + e^{-} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{Ag}(s) $$\nThe potential of this electrode, $E_{\\text{right}}$, is described by the Nernst equation:\n$$ E_{\\text{right}} = E^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{Ag}^{+}/\\mathrm{Ag}} - \\frac{RT}{nF} \\ln\\left(\\frac{a_{\\mathrm{Ag(s)}}}{a_{\\mathrm{Ag}^{+}, \\text{right}}}\\right) $$\nHere, $E^{\\circ}_{\\mathrm{Ag}^{+}/\\mathrm{Ag}}$ is the standard electrode potential for the $\\mathrm{Ag}^{+}/\\mathrm{Ag}$ couple, $R$ is the universal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $F$ is the Faraday constant.

Since $\\mathrm{NaCl}$ is a strong electrolyte, $m_{\\mathrm{Na}^{+}} = m_{\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}} = 0.050\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{kg}^{-1}$. The ionic strength, $I_{\\text{left}}$, is:\n$$ I_{\\text{left}} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i} m_{i} z_{i}^{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ m_{\\mathrm{Na}^{+}}(+1)^{2} + m_{\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}}(-1)^{2} \\right] $$\n$$ I_{\\text{left}} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left[ (0.050)(1) + (0.050)(1) \\right] = 0.050\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{kg}^{-1} $$\nThe activity coefficient of the chloride ion, $\\gamma_{\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}}$, is calculated using the Davies equation with $A = 0.509$ and $z_{\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}} = -1$:\n$$ -\\log_{10} \\gamma_{\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}} = A z_{\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}}^{2} \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{I_{\\text{left}}}}{1 + \\sqrt{I_{\\text{left}}}} - 0.3 I_{\\text{left}} \\right) $$\n$$ -\\log_{10} \\gamma_{\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}} = (0.509)(1)^{2} \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{0.050}}{1 + \\sqrt{0.050}} - (0.3)(0.050) \\right) \\approx 0.509 \\left( \\frac{0.22361}{1.22361} - 0.015 \\right) $$\n$$ -\\log_{10} \\gamma_{\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}} \\approx 0.509 (0.18274 - 0.015) = 0.509 (0.16774) \\approx 0.08538 $$\n$$ \\log_{10} \\gamma_{\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}} \\approx -0.08538 \\implies \\gamma_{\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}} = 10^{-0.08538} \\approx 0.82153 $$\n\nFor the right compartment, the solution contains $\\mathrm{AgNO}_{3}$ at $m_{\\mathrm{AgNO}_{3}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{kg}^{-1}$ and $\\mathrm{NaNO}_{3}$ at $m_{\\mathrm{NaNO}_{3}} = 0.100\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{kg}^{-1}$.

First, we determine the activities $a_{\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}, \\text{left}}$ and $a_{\\mathrm{Ag}^{+}, \\text{right}}$. The standard state is $m^{\\circ} = 1\\ \\mathrm{mol}\\ \\mathrm{kg}^{-1}$.\n$$ a_{\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}, \\text{left}} = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}} \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}}}{m^{\\circ}} = (0.82153) \\frac{0.050}{1} = 0.041077 $$\n$$ a_{\\mathrm{Ag}^{+}, \\text{right}} = \\gamma_{\\mathrm{Ag}^{+}} \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{Ag}^{+}}}{m^{\\circ}} = (0.78153) \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-4}}{1} = 7.8153 \\times 10^{-5} $$\nNow substitute all values into the derived EMF expression. The temperature is $T = 298.15\\ \\mathrm{K}$, $R = 8.314462618\\ \\mathrm{J}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$, $F = 96485.33212\\ \\mathrm{C}\\ \\mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, and $K_{\\mathrm{sp}} = 1.776 \\times 10^{-10}$.\n$$ E = \\frac{(8.31446...)
