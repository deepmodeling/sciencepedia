It is self-contained, scientifically grounded, and well-posed. All necessary data are provided and are consistent with established scientific values. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem requires, first, a derivation of the relationships between electrochemical potential and state functions, and second, the calculation of two specific voltages for a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell.\n\n**Part 1: Derivation of Fundamental Relationships**\n\nWe begin with the fundamental laws of thermodynamics for a closed system that can perform both expansion-compression work ($\\delta w_{\\text{exp}}$) and non-expansion work ($\\delta w_{\\text{non-exp}}$), which in this case is electrical work ($\\delta w_{\\text{elec}}$).\n\nThe First Law of Thermodynamics states that the change in internal energy $dU$ is the sum of heat $\\delta q$ added to the system and work $\\delta w$ done on the system:\n$$dU = \\delta q + \\delta w$$\nThe total work is the sum of expansion work and non-expansion work: $\\delta w = \\delta w_{\\text{exp}} + \\delta w_{\\text{non-exp}}$. For a process occurring against a constant external pressure $p$, the expansion work done on the system is $\\delta w_{\\text{exp}} = -p\\,dV$.\n$$dU = \\delta q - p\\,dV + \\delta w_{\\text{non-exp}}$$\nThe Second Law of Thermodynamics, for a reversible process, relates the heat exchanged to the change in entropy $dS$ at a constant temperature $T$: $\\delta q_{\\text{rev}} = T\\,dS$.\nSubstituting this into the first law for a reversible process:\n$$dU = T\\,dS - p\\,dV + \\delta w_{\\text{non-exp, rev}}$$\nHere, $\\delta w_{\\text{non-exp, rev}}$ represents the maximum possible non-expansion work.\n\nNext, we introduce the state functions Enthalpy ($H$) and Gibbs Free Energy ($G$).\nEnthalpy is defined as $H = U + pV$. Its differential is $dH = dU + p\\,dV + V\\,dp$.\nSubstituting the expression for $dU$:\n$$dH = (T\\,dS - p\\,dV + \\delta w_{\\text{non-exp, rev}}) + p\\,dV + V\\,dp = T\\,dS + V\\,dp + \\delta w_{\\text{non-exp, rev}}$$\nGibbs Free Energy is defined as $G = H - TS$. Its differential is $dG = dH - T\\,dS - S\\,dT$.\nSubstituting the expression for $dH$:\n$$dG = (T\\,dS + V\\,dp + \\delta w_{\\text{non-exp, rev}}) - T\\,dS - S\\,dT = V\\,dp - S\\,dT + \\delta w_{\\text{non-exp, rev}}$$\nFor a process conducted at constant temperature ($dT=0$) and constant pressure ($dp=0$), this fundamental relation simplifies to:\n$$(dG)_{T,p} = \\delta w_{\\text{non-exp, rev}}$$\nFor a finite change from an initial to a final state under these conditions, the change in Gibbs free energy is equal to the total reversible non-expansion work:\n$$(\\Delta G)_{T,p} = w_{\\text{non-exp, rev}}$$\nIn an electrochemical cell, the non-expansion work is electrical work. The work done *by* the system to move a charge $Q$ through an electrical potential difference $E$ is $E \\times Q$. Therefore, the work done *on* the system is $w_{\\text{elec}} = -E \\times Q$. For the reaction of one mole of substance, involving the transfer of $n$ moles of electrons, the total charge transferred is $Q = nF$, where $F$ is the Faraday constant. The reversible electrical work is thus $w_{\\text{non-exp, rev}} = -nFE_{\\text{rev}}$, where $E_{\\text{rev}}$ is the reversible cell voltage.\nSubstituting this into the Gibbs energy expression, we obtain the key relationship:\n$$\\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}}G = -nFE_{\\mathrm{rev}}$$\nUnder standard-state conditions (where all reactants and products are at unit activity), this becomes:\n$$\\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}}G^{\\circ} = -nFE_{\\mathrm{rev}}^{\\circ}$$\nThis equation connects the standard reversible cell voltage $E_{\\mathrm{rev}}^{\\circ}$ to the standard Gibbs free energy of reaction $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}}G^{\\circ}$.\n\nNow we derive the expression for the thermoneutral voltage, $E_{\\mathrm{th}}$. The thermoneutral condition is defined by zero net heat exchange with the surroundings, i.e., $q=0$. We return to the definition of enthalpy, $H=U+pV$. For a finite process at constant pressure $p$, the change in enthalpy is:\n$$\\Delta H = \\Delta U + p\\Delta V$$\nFrom the first law, $\\Delta U = q + w = q + w_{\\text{exp}} + w_{\\text{non-exp}}$. At constant pressure, $w_{\\text{exp}} = -p\\Delta V$.\nTherefore, $\\Delta U = q - p\\Delta V + w_{\\text{non-exp}}$.\nSubstituting this into the enthalpy change equation:\n$$\\Delta H = (q - p\\Delta V + w_{\\text{non-exp}}) + p\\Delta V = q + w_{\\text{non-exp}}$$\nThis general result states that for any process at constant pressure, the enthalpy change is equal to the sum of heat absorbed and non-expansion work done on the system.\nUnder the thermoneutral condition, $q=0$. The cell potential under this condition is the thermoneutral voltage, $E_{\\mathrm{th}}$. The corresponding electrical work is $w_{\\text{non-exp}} = -nFE_{\\mathrm{th}}$.\nThe equation for enthalpy change becomes:\n$$\\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}}H = -nFE_{\\mathrm{th}}$$\nThis equation connects the thermoneutral voltage $E_{\\mathrm{th}}$ to the enthalpy of reaction $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}}H$. For the problem's conditions, we evaluate this using the standard enthalpy of reaction, $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{r}}H^{\\circ}$.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of Voltages**\n\nThe overall reaction is $\\text{H}_{2}(g)+\\tfrac{1}{2}\\,\\text{O}_{2}(g)\\to \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}(l)$.

The problem is self-contained, with no missing information or internal contradictions. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be derived.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in three parts, as requested.\n\nFirst, we determine the discharge termination condition. The discharge is at a constant current $I$. The value of this current is defined by the $C$-rate $\\gamma$ and the nominal capacity $C_{\\mathrm{Ah}}$:\n$$I = \\gamma C_{\\mathrm{Ah}}$$\nThe state-of-charge $z$ is governed by the differential equation $\\frac{dz}{dt} = -I/C_{\\mathrm{Ah}}$. Substituting the expression for $I$, we find:\n$$\\frac{dz}{dt} = -\\frac{\\gamma C_{\\mathrm{Ah}}}{C_{\\mathrm{Ah}}} = -\\gamma$$\nThis is a simple ordinary differential equation. For a discharge process, the initial condition is a fully charged cell, so $z(t=0) = 1$. Integrating the equation from $t=0$ to an arbitrary time $t$ yields the state-of-charge as a function of time:\n$$\\int_{1}^{z(t)} dz' = \\int_{0}^{t} (-\\gamma) dt' \\implies z(t) - 1 = -\\gamma t \\implies z(t) = 1 - \\gamma t$$\nThe terminal voltage $V(t)$ is given by:\n$$V(t) = V_{\\mathrm{oc}}(z(t)) - I R$$\nSubstituting the models for $V_{\\mathrm{oc}}(z)$ and $z(t)$, we obtain the explicit time-dependence of the terminal voltage:\n$$V(t) = (v_{0} + k z(t)) - I R = v_{0} + k(1 - \\gamma t) - I R$$\nDischarge terminates at time $t_{\\mathrm{end}}$ when the terminal voltage reaches the cutoff voltage, $V(t_{\\mathrm{end}}) = V_{\\mathrm{cut}}$.\n$$V_{\\mathrm{cut}} = v_{0} + k(1 - \\gamma t_{\\mathrm{end}}) - I R$$\nFrom this, we can solve for the discharge time $t_{\\mathrm{end}}$:\n$$k(1 - \\gamma t_{\\mathrm{end}}) = V_{\\mathrm{cut}} - v_{0} + I R$$\n$$1 - \\gamma t_{\\mathrm{end}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{cut}} - v_{0} + I R}{k}$$\nNote that the term $1 - \\gamma t_{\\mathrm{end}}$ is simply the state-of-charge at the end of discharge, $z_{\\mathrm{end}} = z(t_{\\mathrm{end}})$. Thus, the discharge termination condition is a specific value for the final state-of-charge:\n$$z_{\\mathrm{end}} = \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{cut}} - v_{0} + I R}{k}$$\nThe discharge time is then found by rearranging the relation $z_{\\mathrm{end}} = 1 - \\gamma t_{\\mathrm{end}}$:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{end}} = \\frac{1 - z_{\\mathrm{end}}}{\\gamma} = \\frac{1}{\\gamma} \\left( 1 - \\frac{V_{\\mathrm{cut}} - v_{0} + I R}{k} \\right) = \\frac{k - (V_{\\mathrm{cut}} - v_{0} + I R)}{k \\gamma}$$\nSubstituting $I = \\gamma C_{\\mathrm{Ah}}$, we have a complete symbolic expression for the discharge time:\n$$t_{\\mathrm{end}} = \\frac{k - V_{\\mathrm{cut}} + v_{0} - \\gamma C_{\\mathrm{Ah}} R}{k \\gamma}$$\n\nSecond, we derive the expression for the specific energy delivered during discharge. The total energy delivered, $E_{\\mathrm{del}}$, is the time integral of the electrical power, $P(t) = V(t)I$.\n$$E_{\\mathrm{del}} = \\int_{0}^{t_{\\mathrm{end}}} P(t) dt = \\int_{0}^{t_{\\mathrm{end}}} V(t) I dt$$\nSince the current $I$ is constant, this simplifies to:\n$$E_{\\mathrm{del}} = I \\int_{0}^{t_{\\mathrm{end}}} V(t) dt$$\nThe term $\\int_{0}^{t_{\\mathrm{end}}} V(t) dt$ can be computed directly.

The premise of a stagnant diffusion layer (the Nernst diffusion layer model) is a standard and valid simplification in electrochemistry. The problem is well-posed, with sufficient data and clearly defined boundary conditions to yield a unique solution. The provided parameters are physically realistic for an aqueous electrochemical system. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nThe solution proceeds as follows.\nThe process is one-dimensional diffusion at steady state. Let the position coordinate $x$ be perpendicular to the planar cathode surface, with $x=0$ at the cathode and $x=L$ at the interface with the bulk reservoir. The transport of the electroactive species $\\text{M}^{+}$ through the stagnant layer is described by Fick's first law of diffusion:\n$$\nJ(x) = -D \\frac{dc(x)}{dx}\n$$\nwhere $J(x)$ is the molar flux of $\\text{M}^{+}$ in units of $\\text{mol}\\ \\text{m}^{-2}\\ \\text{s}^{-1}$, $D$ is the diffusion coefficient, and $c(x)$ is the molar concentration.\n\nAt steady state, the flux $J$ must be constant throughout the layer ($0  x  L$), as there is no accumulation or depletion of the species within the diffusion layer. Thus, we can write:\n$$\n\\frac{dc}{dx} = -\\frac{J}{D} = \\text{constant}\n$$\nThis linear first-order ordinary differential equation can be integrated across the layer from $x=0$ to $x=L$:\n$$\n\\int_{c(0)}^{c(L)} dc = \\int_{0}^{L} \\left(-\\frac{J}{D}\\right) dx\n$$\nThis yields:\n$$\nc(L) - c(0) = -\\frac{J}{D}(L - 0)\n$$\nThe boundary conditions are given by the problem statement. The concentration at the edge of the diffusion layer is the bulk concentration, $c(L) = c_{0}$. The problem asks for the maximum, or limiting, current density, which occurs when the concentration of the reactant at the electrode surface is depleted to zero, so $c(0) = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these boundary conditions gives the limiting flux, $J_{lim}$:\n$$\nc_{0} - 0 = -\\frac{J_{lim}}{D} L\n$$\nThe flux is directed towards the electrode (in the negative $x$ direction), so its value is negative. The magnitude of the limiting flux is:\n$$\n|J_{lim}| = \\frac{D c_{0}}{L}\n$$\nThe current density, $i$, is related to the molar flux by Faraday's law. The current is the charge passed per unit area per unit time.\n$$\ni = n F J\n$$\nHere, $n$ is the number of moles of electrons transferred per mole of the electroactive species reacting. The reaction is the reduction of a monovalent cation $\\text{M}^{+}$:\n$$\n\\text{M}^{+} + e^{-} \\rightarrow \\text{M}(s)\n$$\nFor this reaction, $n=1$. The problem also specifies the ionic charge number $z=1$. The number of electrons transferred $n$ is equal to the magnitude of the ionic charge, $|z|$. Thus, the limiting current density, $i_{lim}$, is:\n$$\ni_{lim} = n F |J_{lim}| = |z| F \\frac{D c_{0}}{L}\n$$\nTo calculate the numerical value, all parameters must be in a consistent set of units.
