The terminal sulfur atom, $S_t$, is bonded only to the central sulfur atom, $S_c$. The two sulfur atoms are not symmetry-equivalent.\n- **Foundational Definitions and Constraints:**\n    1.  The oxidation state is the charge an atom would possess if bonds were treated as ionic, assigning the electron pair in a heteronuclear bond to the more electronegative atom and splitting the pair equally in a homonuclear bond.\n    2.  The oxidation state of oxygen in ordinary covalent compounds is $-2$.\n    3.  The sum of oxidation states of all atoms in an ion must equal the net charge of the ion.\n    4.  IUPAC conventions are to be applied.\n- **Question:** Determine the oxidation state of each sulfur atom ($S_c$ and $S_t$) and explain why this detailed assignment is different from the inference that each sulfur has an oxidation state of $+2$.\n\n**Step 2: Validation**\nThe problem is scientifically grounded, dealing with the standard chemical concept of oxidation states. It is well-posed, providing a specific molecular structure and a clear set of rules for calculation. The language is objective and precise. The premises are factually correct: the structure of thiosulfate is well-known, and the rules provided are standard IUPAC definitions. The problem is not trivial; it addresses the important distinction between formal (atom-specific) oxidation states and average oxidation states, a common point of confusion. The problem is self-contained, consistent, and solvable based on the information provided, assuming standard knowledge of relative electronegativities (Oxygen is more electronegative than Sulfur).\n\n**Step 3: Verdict**\nThe problem statement is valid. I will proceed with a solution.\n\n**Derivation of Oxidation States**\n\nFirst, we calculate the total oxidation state of the two sulfur atoms. Let $OS(S)$ be the oxidation state of a sulfur atom and $OS(O)$ be the oxidation state of an oxygen atom. According to the given rules:\n$$\n\\sum OS = \\text{charge of ion}\n$$\n$$\n2 \\times OS(\\text{average S}) + 3 \\times OS(O) = -2\n$$\nUsing the provided rule that $OS(O) = -2$:\n$$\n2 \\times OS(\\text{average S}) + 3 \\times (-2) = -2\n$$\n$$\n2 \\times OS(\\text{average S}) - 6 = -2\n$$\n$$\n2 \\times OS(\\text{average S}) = +4\n$$\nThis gives an average oxidation state of $OS(\\text{average S}) = +2$ for each sulfur atom, as mentioned in the problem statement. However, this assumes the sulfur atoms are equivalent, which they are not.\n\nTo find the individual oxidation states, we must apply the foundational definition based on bond polarity to the specific structure of the ion. This requires considering the electron partitioning based on a plausible bonding model and then applying the ionic approximation.\n\nLet's apply the bond-cleavage rule by considering electron counts:\n- **Central Sulfur ($S_c$):** A neutral sulfur atom has $6$ valence electrons. In our hypothetical cleavage:\n    - It loses all its bonding electrons to the three more electronegative oxygen atoms it is bonded to.\n    - It gets half the electrons from the homonuclear $\\mathrm{S_c\\!-\\!S_t}$ bond. Assuming a single bond, it gets $1$ electron.\n    - Its final assigned electron count is $1$.\n    - The oxidation state is its valence electron count minus its final assigned electron count: $OS(S_c) = 6 - 1 = +5$.\n- **Terminal Sulfur ($S_t$):** A neutral sulfur atom has $6$ valence electrons.\n    - It is only bonded to the other sulfur atom. In this homonuclear bond, it is assigned half the bonding electrons (1 electron from a single bond).\n    - All other valence electrons are non-bonding lone pair electrons, which it retains. In a typical Lewis structure, the terminal sulfur has 6 non-bonding electrons to complete its octet.\n    - Its final assigned electron count is $6 \\text{ (non-bonding)} + 1 \\text{ (from bond)} = 7$.\n    - The oxidation state is $OS(S_t) = 6 - 7 = -1$.\n\n**Check:** The sum of the calculated oxidation states is $OS(S_c) + OS(S_t) = (+5) + (-1) = +4$. The total sum for the ion is $(+4) + 3 \\times (-2) = -2$, which is correct. This result is consistent with the IUPAC recommendation for thiosulfate.\n\n**Reason for Deviation from Average:** The average value of $+2$ is a mathematical artifact that falsely assumes the two sulfur atoms are chemically identical. The foundational rules for oxidation states are based on atomic connectivity and electronegativity. Because the central sulfur $S_c$ is bonded to three highly electronegative oxygen atoms and the terminal sulfur $S_t$ is not, the oxidative effect of the oxygen atoms is localized entirely on $S_c$. The homonuclear $\\mathrm{S\\!-\\!S}$ bond does not transfer charge between the sulfur atoms. This structural asymmetry mandates an asymmetric distribution of oxidation states.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. The sulfur bound to oxygen is $+5$ and the terminal sulfur is $-1$; this follows because all $\\mathrm{S\\!-\\!O}$ bonding electron pairs are assigned to oxygen (more electronegative), while the $\\mathrm{S\\!-\\!S}$ bond is homonuclear and contributes zero to either sulfur’s oxidation state, so the two sulfur atoms cannot share the total sulfur oxidation state equally.**\n- The oxidation states $OS(S_c) = +5$ and $OS(S_t) = -1$ are correct as derived above.\n- The reasoning is scientifically sound. It correctly identifies that heteronuclear $\\mathrm{S\\!-\\!O}$ bonds lead to oxidation of sulfur by oxygen, while the homonuclear $\\mathrm{S\\!-\\!S}$ bond does not cause charge separation between the sulfur atoms. This directly and correctly explains the unequal distribution.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The sulfur bound to oxygen is $+6$ and the terminal sulfur is $-2$; this follows because the central sulfur is analogous to sulfur in sulfate and the terminal sulfur behaves as a sulfide, with the $\\mathrm{S\\!-\\!S}$ bond having no effect.**\n- These oxidation state values, $OS(S_c) = +6$ and $OS(S_t) = -2$, while summing to the required $+4$, are incorrect.\n- The reasoning is based on an analogy, not the foundational definitions requested. It treats the thiosulfate ion as if it were formed from a hypothetical $\\mathrm{SO_3}$ unit (where S would be $+6$) and a sulfide ion $\\mathrm{S^{2-}}$. This incorrectly treats the covalent $\\mathrm{S\\!-\\!S}$ bond as fully ionic, contradicting the rule for homonuclear bonds.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Both sulfur atoms are $+2$; this follows because the $-2$ charge and resonance delocalization lead to an even sharing of electron density across the sulfur atoms.**\n- This option presents the average oxidation state as the actual oxidation state for each atom, which is incorrect.\n- The reasoning is flawed. While resonance does delocalize electron density and formal charge, the concept of oxidation state is a formalistic bookkeeping method based on a hypothetical complete charge separation in polar bonds. It does not reflect the true electron distribution. Furthermore, the problem explicitly states the sulfur atoms are not equivalent, so an equal sharing is impossible.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The sulfur bound to oxygen is $+4$ and the terminal sulfur is $0$; this follows because electron loss to oxygen is compensated by equal sharing in the $\\mathrm{S\\!-\\!S}$ bond, leaving the terminal sulfur unaffected.**\n- These oxidation states, $OS(S_c) = +4$ and $OS(S_t) = 0$, are incorrect according to the rigorous application of the bond cleavage rule. This assignment can arise from an analogy where elemental sulfur ($OS=0$) reacts with sulfite, $\\mathrm{SO_3^{2-}}$ (where S is $+4$), but this is not a derivation from the requested foundational principles.\n- The reasoning provided is vague. The claim that the terminal sulfur is \"unaffected\" is an assertion, not a conclusion derived from the rules.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2954791"}, {"introduction": "While the half-reaction method is a common tool for balancing redox equations, a more rigorous and systematic approach exists using linear algebra.

The weaker bond results in a lower $\\nu(\\mathrm{NO})$ stretching frequency, typically in the range of $1600\\text{–}1750\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$.

The experimental angle of $131^\\circ$ is in excellent agreement with this prediction.\n*   **Magnetism**: $\\mathrm{Co(III)}$ is a $d^6$ ion. In an octahedral field with strong-field ligands like $\\mathrm{NH_3}$, it will adopt a low-spin $(t_{2g})^6(e_g)^0$ configuration. All electrons are paired, so the complex is diamagnetic ($S=0$) and hence EPR-silent. This is in perfect agreement with the experimental report that $\\mu_\\mathrm{eff} \\le 0.10\\,\\mu_\\mathrm{B}$ and the complex is EPR-silent.\n*   **Conclusion**: This formalism is consistent with all available experimental data.\n\n**Evaluation of the Provided Options**\n\n*   **A. $\\mathrm{NO^+}$ (linear nitrosyl, high $\\nu(\\mathrm{NO})$), $\\mathrm{Co}$ in oxidation state $+1$; expect $\\nu(\\mathrm{NO}) \\gtrsim 1850\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, $\\angle(\\mathrm{Co\\!-\\!N\\!-\\!O}) \\approx 180^\\circ$, and an octahedral $d^8$ center that is paramagnetic with $S=1$.**\n    The expected properties for this formalism are stated correctly, but they are all contradicted by the experimental data. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **B. $\\mathrm{NO\\cdot}$ (neutral nitrosyl, intermediate $\\nu(\\mathrm{NO})$), $\\mathrm{Co}$ in oxidation state $+2$; expect $\\nu(\\mathrm{NO}) \\approx 1750\\text{–}1850\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, $\\angle(\\mathrm{Co\\!-\\!N\\!-\\!O})$ closer to linear, and an $S=\\tfrac{1}{2}$ system that is EPR-active with $g \\approx 2$ and resolved $^{14}\\mathrm{N}$ hyperfine coupling.**\n    This option incorrectly predicts an $S=1/2$ paramagnetic system, whereas the complex is diamagnetic. The expected IR frequency is also higher than what is observed. **Incorrect**.\n\n*   **C. $\\mathrm{NO^-}$ (bent nitrosyl, low $\\nu(\\mathrm{NO})$), $\\mathrm{Co}$ in oxidation state $+3$; expect $\\nu(\\mathrm{NO}) \\approx 1600\\text{–}1750\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$, $\\angle(\\mathrm{Co\\!-\\!N\\!-\\!O}) \\approx 120^\\circ\\text{–}140^\\circ$, and a low-spin octahedral $d^6$ center that is diamagnetic and EPR-silent.**\n    This option correctly identifies the cobalt oxidation state as $+3$ and the nitrosyl ligand as $\\mathrm{NO^-}$. The expected properties listed—low $\\nu(\\mathrm{NO})$, bent geometry, and diamagnetism of a low-spin $d^6$ center—are all in excellent agreement with the experimental data. **Correct**.\n\n*   **D. Delocalized $\\mathrm{M\\!-\\!NO}$ bonding... treat the nitrosyl as predominantly $\\mathrm{NO^+}$ ... invoke strong antiferromagnetic coupling to rationalize an overall $S=0$ ground state ... linear nitrosyl and $\\nu(\\mathrm{NO}) \\gtrsim 1850\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$.**\n    This option invokes a physically unsound mechanism for diamagnetism (antiferromagnetic coupling is not relevant for a closed-shell ligand and a single $d^8$ metal center) and incorrectly predicts a linear geometry and high IR frequency associated with the $\\mathrm{NO^+}$ formalism, both of which are contradicted by the data. **Incorrect**.\n\nTherefore, the only option that provides a consistent and chemically sound explanation for all experimental observations is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2954749"}]}
