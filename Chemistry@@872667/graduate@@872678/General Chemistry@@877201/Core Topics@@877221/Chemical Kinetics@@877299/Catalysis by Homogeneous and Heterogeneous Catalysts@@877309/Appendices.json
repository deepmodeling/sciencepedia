This group is used to assess the significance of internal diffusion limitations on the observed reaction rate.\n\nWe begin by defining the characteristic time scales for the two competing processes: intrapellet diffusion and chemical reaction.\n\nThe characteristic time for diffusion, $\\tau_{diff}$, is the time it takes for a reactant molecule to travel a characteristic distance within the catalyst pellet. For a spherical pellet of radius $R_{p}$, this characteristic length scale is $R_{p}$. The diffusion process is governed by the effective diffusivity, $D_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. The relationship between time, distance, and diffusivity from dimensional analysis is $L^2 \\sim Dt$. Therefore, the characteristic diffusion time is given by:\n$$\n\\tau_{diff} = \\frac{R_{p}^{2}}{D_{\\mathrm{eff}}}\n$$\nThe units of this expression are $(\\mathrm{m}^2) / (\\mathrm{m}^2\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) = \\mathrm{s}$, which is correct for a time scale.\n\nThe characteristic time for reaction, $\\tau_{rxn}$, is the time required to consume a certain concentration of reactant at a given rate. The problem provides the gas-phase concentration at the pellet surface, $C_{\\mathrm{A}s}$, and the observed volumetric rate of consumption, $r_{\\mathrm{A,obs}}$. We define the characteristic reaction time based on these observable quantities. The observed rate $r_{\\mathrm{A,obs}}$ represents the moles of A consumed per unit volume of pellet per unit time. Therefore, the time to consume a concentration equal to $C_{\\mathrm{A}s}$ at this rate is:\n$$\n\\tau_{rxn} = \\frac{C_{\\mathrm{A}s}}{r_{\\mathrm{A,obs}}}\n$$\nThe units are $(\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}) / (\\mathrm{mol}\\,\\mathrm{m}^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) = \\mathrm{s}$, which is correct.\n\nA dimensionless group that assesses the importance of diffusion limitations is formed by comparing the rate of reaction to the rate of diffusion. This is equivalent to comparing the diffusion time scale to the reaction time scale. When diffusion is slow compared to reaction (i.e., $\\tau_{diff} > \\tau_{rxn}$), internal transport limitations are significant. The dimensionless group is therefore constructed as the ratio of the characteristic diffusion time to the characteristic reaction time.\n$$\n\\Phi = \\frac{\\tau_{diff}}{\\tau_{rxn}}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the time scales:\n$$\n\\Phi = \\frac{R_{p}^{2} / D_{\\mathrm{eff}}}{C_{\\mathrm{A}s} / r_{\\mathrm{A,obs}}} = \\frac{r_{\\mathrm{A,obs}} R_{p}^{2}}{D_{\\mathrm{eff}} C_{\\mathrm{A}s}}\n$$\nThis dimensionless group is known in reaction engineering as the Weisz-Prater criterion. It uses the observed reaction rate to diagnose diffusion limitations. A value of $\\Phi \\gg 1$ indicates severe diffusion limitation.\n\nThe problem statement claims this derivation should start from Fick's second law. The steady-state material balance for reactant A within the porous sphere, incorporating Fickian diffusion and a reaction term, is:\n$$\nD_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\nabla^2 C_A - (-r_A) = 0\n$$\nwhere $-r_A$ is the intrinsic rate of reaction.
