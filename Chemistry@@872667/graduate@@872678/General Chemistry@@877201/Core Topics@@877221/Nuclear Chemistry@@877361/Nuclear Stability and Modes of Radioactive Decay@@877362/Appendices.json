It is well-posed, as all necessary data and constants are provided for a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem is free of factual unsoundness, non-formalizable concepts, incompleteness, contradictions, or any other listed flaw.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe nuclear binding energy, $B$, of a nucleus $^A_Z X$ is defined as the energy required to disassemble the nucleus into its $Z$ constituent protons and $N$ constituent neutrons, where $A = Z+N$ is the mass number. According to the mass–energy equivalence principle, this energy corresponds to the mass defect, $\\Delta m$.\nThe mass defect is the difference between the sum of the masses of the individual free nucleons and the mass of the bound nucleus, $m_{nuc}(^A_Z X)$. Let $m_p$ be the proton mass and $m_n$ be the neutron mass.\n$$ \\Delta m = Z m_p + N m_n - m_{nuc}(^A_Z X) $$\nThe binding energy is therefore:\n$$ B = (\\Delta m) c^2 = (Z m_p + N m_n - m_{nuc}(^A_Z X))c^2 $$\nExperimental data typically provide atomic masses, $m(^A_Z X)$, not nuclear masses. The atomic mass includes the mass of the nucleus, the mass of the $Z$ electrons ($m_e$), and accounts for the total electronic binding energy, $B_e$.\n$$ m(^A_Z X) = m_{nuc}(^A_Z X) + Z m_e - \\frac{B_e(^A_Z X)}{c^2} $$\nFrom this, the nuclear mass can be expressed as:\n$$ m_{nuc}(^A_Z X) = m(^A_Z X) - Z m_e + \\frac{B_e(^A_Z X)}{c^2} $$\nSubstituting this expression into the equation for binding energy:\n$$ B = \\left(Z m_p + N m_n - \\left[m(^A_Z X) - Z m_e + \\frac{B_e(^A_Z X)}{c^2}\\right]\\right) c^2 $$\n$$ B = (Z m_p + Z m_e + N m_n - m(^A_Z X) - \\frac{B_e(^A_Z X)}{c^2}) c^2 $$\nTo handle the proton mass $m_p$, we use the provided mass of the hydrogen atom, $m(^1\\mathrm{H})$. The mass of a hydrogen atom is the sum of the proton mass and electron mass, corrected for the electronic binding energy of hydrogen ($13.6~\\mathrm{eV}$):\n$$ m(^1\\mathrm{H}) = m_p + m_e - \\frac{B_e(^1\\mathrm{H})}{c^2} $$\nWe can express the term $(m_p + m_e)$ as:\n$$ m_p + m_e = m(^1\\mathrm{H}) + \\frac{B_e(^1\\mathrm{H})}{c^2} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $B$:\n$$ B = \\left(Z \\left[m(^1\\mathrm{H}) + \\frac{B_e(^1\\mathrm{H})}{c^2}\\right] + N m_n - m(^A_Z X) - \\frac{B_e(^A_Z X)}{c^2}\\right) c^2 $$\n$$ B = \\left(Z m(^1\\mathrm{H}) + N m_n - m(^A_Z X)\\right)c^2 + Z B_e(^1\\mathrm{H}) - B_e(^A_Z X) $$\nThe problem states that electronic binding energies are negligible. This is a sound approximation. Nuclear binding energies are of the order of megaelectronvolts (MeV), whereas total electronic binding energies are of the order of kiloelectronvolts (keV) at most (e.g., for Uranium, $B_e \\approx 115~\\mathrm{keV}$). The term $Z B_e(^1\\mathrm{H}) - B_e(^A_Z X)$ is thus many orders of magnitude smaller than the nuclear binding energy and can be neglected.

In $\\beta^{-}$ decay the nucleus changes from $J_i^{\\pi_i}$ to $J_f^{\\pi_f}$ while emitting an electron and an antineutrino. The lepton pair carries orbital angular momentum $L$ and total spin $S$, where $S=0$ corresponds to vector (Fermi) coupling and $S=1$ to axial-vector Gamow–Teller (GT) coupling.\n- The spatial parity of the lepton partial wave is $(-1)^L$. Therefore, if $L=0$ the nuclear parity does not change; if $L=1$ the nuclear parity changes; more generally parity changes if and only if $L$ is odd.\n- The lepton total angular momentum $j$ arises from coupling $L$ and $S$, so $j$ can take values $|L-S|,\\dots,L+S$. The nuclear angular momentum change is $\\Delta J \\equiv |J_f - J_i|$, which must be compatible with $j$. The minimum $L$ allowed by parity and $\\Delta J$ characterizes the degree of forbiddenness: $L=0$ is allowed; $L=1$ is first-forbidden; $L=2$ is second-forbidden; and so on. When exactly one nuclear operator contributes (specifically when $\\Delta J = L+1$), the transition is called unique; otherwise it is non-unique.\n\nUsing these principles, classify each branch:\n\n- Branch $\\mathrm{A}$: $J_i^{\\pi_i} = \\tfrac{3}{2}^{-} \\to J_f^{\\pi_f} = \\tfrac{3}{2}^{-}$. Here $\\Delta J = \\left|\\tfrac{3}{2}-\\tfrac{3}{2}\\right| = 0$ and parity does not change ($- \\to -$). Thus $L=0$ is allowed by parity, and with $L=0$ one can have $S=0$ (Fermi) with $j=0$ or $S=1$ (GT) with $j=1$ or $j=0$. The $\\Delta J=0$ case is consistent with allowed transitions. Therefore, branch $\\mathrm{A}$ is allowed. In general, for $\\Delta J=0$ and no parity change there can be an admixture of Fermi and GT amplitudes (subject to isospin constraints for Fermi matrix elements), so “allowed (Fermi/GT admixture possible)” is the correct level of classification.\n\n- Branch $\\mathrm{B}$: $J_i^{\\pi_i} = \\tfrac{3}{2}^{-} \\to J_f^{\\pi_f} = \\tfrac{1}{2}^{-}$. Here $\\Delta J = \\left|\\tfrac{3}{2}-\\tfrac{1}{2}\\right| = 1$ and parity does not change. Parity conservation for $L=0$ is satisfied, and with $L=0$ one must have $S=1$ (GT) to reach $\\Delta J=1$ because $S=0$ (Fermi) allows only $\\Delta J=0$. Hence branch $\\mathrm{B}$ is allowed of GT type.\n\n- Branch $\\mathrm{C}$: $J_i^{\\pi_i} = \\tfrac{3}{2}^{-} \\to J_f^{\\pi_f} = \\tfrac{1}{2}^{+}$. Here $\\Delta J = 1$ and parity changes ($- \\to +$). A parity change requires odd $L$, so the minimum is $L=1$ (first-forbidden). For $L=1$ one can have $S=0$ (then $j=1$) or $S=1$ (then $j=0,1,2$), all of which can accommodate $\\Delta J=1$. Multiple nuclear operators can contribute in this case, so it is first-forbidden non-unique.\n\n- Branch $\\mathrm{D}$: $J_i^{\\pi_i} = \\tfrac{3}{2}^{-} \\to J_f^{\\pi_f} = \\tfrac{7}{2}^{+}$. Here $\\Delta J = \\left|\\tfrac{7}{2}-\\tfrac{3}{2}\\right| = 2$ and parity changes. Parity change again requires odd $L$, and the minimum is $L=1$. With $L=1$ and $S=1$ one can form $j=2$, which matches $\\Delta J=2$. This case, with $\\Delta J = L+1$, is the hallmark of a unique transition of the corresponding degree, so branch $\\mathrm{D}$ is first-forbidden unique.\n\nHaving classified the branches, we connect classification to $ft$ and half-life scaling. The comparative half-life $ft$ removes the gross phase-space dependence (contained in $f$) so that, for equal $f$, the ordering of $ft$ reflects primarily the hindrance due to angular momentum and parity constraints. Allowed transitions ($L=0$) generally have the smallest $ft$ values; forbidden transitions have larger $ft$, increasing with the degree of forbiddenness. Within the same forbiddenness, cases with larger $\\Delta J$ (the unique subset) are typically more hindered than non-unique cases at the same order because they require a higher coupled lepton angular momentum and involve higher-order operators.\n\nTherefore, with $f$ taken equal across branches, the expected ordering from smallest to largest is\n$$\n\\mathrm{A}\\approx \\mathrm{B} \\;<\\; \\mathrm{C} \\;<\\; \\mathrm{D},\n$$\nand the partial half-lives (which, for fixed $f$, scale with $ft$) follow the same ordering: the allowed branches $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{B}$ are shortest, the first-forbidden non-unique branch $\\mathrm{C}$ is longer, and the first-forbidden unique branch $\\mathrm{D}$ is the longest.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\n- Option A: This states $\\mathrm{A}$ allowed (Fermi/GT possible), $\\mathrm{B}$ allowed (GT), $\\mathrm{C}$ first-forbidden non-unique, $\\mathrm{D}$ first-forbidden unique, with $ft$ ordering $\\mathrm{A}\\approx\\mathrm{B}<\\mathrm{C}<\\mathrm{D}$. This matches the derivation above. Verdict — Correct.\n\n- Option B: It misclassifies $\\mathrm{B}$ as first-forbidden non-unique even though $\\Delta J=1$ with no parity change is allowed GT. It also misclassifies $\\mathrm{C}$ as allowed despite a parity change, and labels $\\mathrm{D}$ as second-forbidden unique, whereas with $\\Delta J=2$ and parity change the minimum is $L=1$ (first-forbidden), not $L=2$. The $ft$ ordering is therefore based on incorrect classifications. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\n- Option C: It misclassifies $\\mathrm{A}$ as first-forbidden non-unique (it is allowed) and $\\mathrm{C}$ as allowed GT despite a required parity change. The proposed $ft$ ordering is inconsistent with the correct allowed/forbidden hierarchy. Verdict — Incorrect.\n\n- Option D: It asserts $\\mathrm{A}$ is allowed GT only (excluding a possible Fermi component without stated isospin justification), and it misclassifies $\\mathrm{C}$ as first-forbidden unique and $\\mathrm{D}$ as first-forbidden non-unique, reversing the correct unique/non-unique assignments for $\\Delta J=1$ versus $\\Delta J=2$ at $L=1$. The $ft$ ordering then does not align with the correct classification. Verdict — Incorrect.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2948195"}]}
