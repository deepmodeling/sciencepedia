It is a standard exercise in general chemistry concerning the application of Lewis structure theory and the concept of formal charge. The problem provides all necessary information to deduce a unique and verifiable answer. Therefore, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe primary task is to calculate the formal charge on each atom in a specific resonance contributor of the nitrate ion, $\\mathrm{NO_3^{-}}$. The formal charge, a conceptual tool for electron bookkeeping, is defined for an atom in a molecule by the following relation:\n\n$$q_{formal} = V - N - \\frac{B}{2}$$\n\nHere, $V$ represents the number of valence electrons of the neutral atom in its ground state, $N$ is the number of non-bonding valence electrons on the atom in the Lewis structure, and $B$ is the total number of electrons shared in covalent bonds with the atom.\n\nFirst, we establish the number of valence electrons, $V$, for the constituent atoms based on their position in the periodic table.\n- Nitrogen ($\\mathrm{N}$) is in Group $15$, thus $V_{\\mathrm{N}} = 5$.\n- Oxygen ($\\mathrm{O}$) is in Group $16$, thus $V_{\\mathrm{O}} = 6$.\n\nThe problem describes a specific resonance structure. We must construct this structure by adhering to the given bonding pattern and the octet rule for second-period elements, which dictates that each atom must be associated with $8$ valence electrons.\n\nThe structure is described as:\n1. A central nitrogen atom, $\\mathrm{N}$.\n2. A double bond between $\\mathrm{N}$ and one oxygen atom, labeled $\\mathrm{O_a}$.\n3. Single bonds between $\\mathrm{N}$ and two other oxygen atoms, labeled $\\mathrm{O_b}$ and $\\mathrm{O_c}$.\n\nNow, we add lone pair electrons to each atom to satisfy the octet rule.\n- For the central nitrogen atom ($\\mathrm{N}$): It participates in one double bond ($4$ electrons) and two single bonds ($2 \\times 2 = 4$ electrons). The total number of bonding electrons associated with $\\mathrm{N}$ is $4 + 4 = 8$. The octet for nitrogen is satisfied by its bonding electrons alone. Therefore, the number of non-bonding electrons on $\\mathrm{N}$ is $N_{\\mathrm{N}} = 0$.\n- For the doubly-bonded oxygen atom ($\\mathrm{O_a}$): It is involved in a double bond, accounting for $4$ electrons. To complete its octet of $8$ electrons, it requires $8 - 4 = 4$ additional electrons. These must be non-bonding electrons, corresponding to $2$ lone pairs. So, $N_{\\mathrm{O_a}} = 4$.\n- For the singly-bonded oxygen atoms ($\\mathrm{O_b}$ and $\\mathrm{O_c}$): Each is involved in a single bond, accounting for $2$ electrons. To complete its octet, each requires $8 - 2 = 6$ additional electrons. These must be non-bonding electrons, corresponding to $3$ lone pairs. Thus, for both $\\mathrm{O_b}$ and $\\mathrm{O_c}$, the number of non-bonding electrons is $N_{\\mathrm{O_b}} = N_{\\mathrm{O_c}} = 6$.\n\nWith the Lewis structure fully defined, we can now calculate the formal charge for each atom.\n\n- Formal charge on Nitrogen ($q_{\\mathrm{N}}$):\n  The atom has $V_{\\mathrm{N}} = 5$ valence electrons. It has $N_{\\mathrm{N}} = 0$ non-bonding electrons and $B_{\\mathrm{N}} = 8$ bonding electrons.\n  $$q_{\\mathrm{N}} = 5 - 0 - \\frac{8}{2} = 5 - 4 = +1$$\n\n- Formal charge on the doubly-bonded Oxygen ($q_{\\mathrm{O_a}}$):\n  The atom has $V_{\\mathrm{O}} = 6$ valence electrons.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of general chemistry, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information to derive a unique solution without contradiction. We will now proceed with a solution from first principles.\n\nThe central task is to analyze the electronic structure of the carboxylate anion, $\\mathrm{RCO_2^-}$, using the formalism of Lewis structures and resonance theory. The problem correctly restricts the analysis to the two major, equivalent resonance contributors.\n\nFirst, we establish the number of valence electrons for the atoms of interest. Carbon ($\\mathrm{C}$) is in group $14$ of the periodic table and therefore possesses $4$ valence electrons. Oxygen ($\\mathrm{O}$) is in group $16$ and possesses $6$ valence electrons.\n\nThe formal charge ($FC$) on an atom in a Lewis structure is a bookkeeping tool defined as the difference between the number of valence electrons of the neutral atom ($V$) and the number of electrons assigned to it in the Lewis structure. The assigned electrons are the sum of all non-bonding (lone pair) electrons ($N$) and half of the bonding (shared) electrons ($B$).\n$$FC = V - N - \\frac{1}{2}B$$\n\nWe are instructed to construct two canonical Lewis structures. Let us label the atoms as $\\mathrm{C}$, $\\mathrm{O}(1)$, and $\\mathrm{O}(2)$.\n\n**Canonical Structure I:**\nIn the first structure, we place the double bond between $\\mathrm{C}$ and $\\mathrm{O}(1)$ and the single bond between $\\mathrm{C}$ and $\\mathrm{O}(2)$. The carbon atom is also bonded to a generic group $\\mathrm{R}$. To satisfy the octet rule for carbon, it must form four covalent bonds and have no lone pairs.\n-   The carbon atom, $\\mathrm{C}$, has one single bond to $\\mathrm{R}$, one double bond to $\\mathrm{O}(1)$, and one single bond to $\\mathrm{O}(2)$. It shares a total of $8$ electrons.\n-   The oxygen atom $\\mathrm{O}(1)$ is part of a double bond. To satisfy its octet, it must have $4$ non-bonding electrons, which corresponds to $2$ lone pairs.\n-   The oxygen atom $\\mathrm{O}(2)$ is part of a single bond. To satisfy its octet, it must have $6$ non-bonding electrons, which corresponds to $3$ lone pairs.\n\nNow, we compute the formal charge for each atom in this structure:\n-   $FC_{\\mathrm{C}} = 4 - 0 - \\frac{1}{2}(8) = 4 - 4 = 0$\n-   $FC_{\\mathrm{O}(1)} = 6 - 4 - \\frac{1}{2}(4) = 6 - 4 - 2 = 0$\n-   $FC_{\\mathrm{O}(2)} = 6 - 6 - \\frac{1}{2}(2) = 6 - 6 - 1 = -1$\nThe sum of formal charges is $0 + 0 + (-1) = -1$, which matches the overall charge of the ion.\n\n**Canonical Structure II:**\nThe second structure is generated by delocalizing the $\\pi$ electrons. We place the double bond between $\\mathrm{C}$ and $\\mathrm{O}(2)$ and the single bond between $\\mathrm{C}$ and $\\mathrm{O}(1)$.\n-   The carbon atom, $\\mathrm{C}$, has the same bonding pattern: four bonds, zero lone pairs.\n-   The oxygen atom $\\mathrm{O}(1)$ is now single-bonded to $\\mathrm{C}$ and must have $6$ non-bonding electrons ($3$ lone pairs) to satisfy its octet.\n-   The oxygen atom $\\mathrm{O}(2)$ is now double-bonded to $\\mathrm{C}$ and must have $4$ non-bonding electrons ($2$ lone pairs) to satisfy its octet.\n\nWe compute the formal charges for Structure II:\n-   $FC_{\\mathrm{C}} = 4 - 0 - \\frac{1}{2}(8) = 4 - 4 = 0$\n-   $FC_{\\mathrm{O}(1)} = 6 - 6 - \\frac{1}{2}(2) = 6 - 6 - 1 = -1$\n-   $FC_{\\mathrm{O}(2)} = 6 - 4 - \\frac{1}{2}(4) = 6 - 4 - 2 = 0$\nAgain, the sum of formal charges is $0 + (-1) + 0 = -1$, consistent with the ion's charge.\n\n**Symmetry and Resonance Weights:**\nThe two canonical structures, I and II, are chemically indistinguishable. They are identical in terms of bonding patterns and formal charge distribution, differing only in the arbitrary labels of the oxygen atoms. One structure can be mapped onto the other by a reflection through the plane bisecting the $\\mathrm{O-C-O}$ angle. Because they are energetically degenerate, they must contribute equally to the true electronic structure of the ion, which is a resonance hybrid of these two forms. Therefore, the weight of each structure, $w$, is identical: $w_I = w_{II} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n**Resonance-Averaged Formal Charges:**\nThe formal charge on each atom in the resonance hybrid, $q^{\\mathrm{hybrid}}$, is the weighted average of its formal charges across the contributing canonical structures.\n-   For carbon: $q_{\\mathrm{C}} = w_I \\cdot FC_{\\mathrm{C}, I} + w_{II} \\cdot FC_{\\mathrm{C}, II} = \\frac{1}{2}(0) + \\frac{1}{2}(0) = 0$.\n-   For oxygen $\\mathrm{O}(1)$: $q_{\\mathrm{O}(1)} = w_I \\cdot FC_{\\mathrm{O}(1), I} + w_{II} \\cdot FC_{\\mathrm{O}(1), II} = \\frac{1}{2}(0) + \\frac{1}{2}(-1) = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\n-   For oxygen $\\mathrm{O}(2)$: $q_{\\mathrm{O}(2)} = w_I \\cdot FC_{\\mathrm{O}(2), I} + w_{II} \\cdot FC_{\\mathrm{O}(2), II} = \\frac{1}{2}(-1) + \\frac{1}{2}(0) = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThis result shows that in the resonance hybrid, the two oxygen atoms are identical, and each bears precisely half of the negative charge. The carbon atom remains formally neutral.\n\n**Experimental Observables:**\nThis resonance picture is not merely a theoretical construct; it has direct, verifiable experimental consequences. We compare the carboxylate anion, $\\mathrm{RCO_2^-}$, with its conjugate acid, the carboxylic acid $\\mathrm{RCO_2H}$, which does not exhibit significant resonance stabilization. In $\\mathrm{RCO_2H}$, there is a localized $\\mathrm{C=O}$ double bond and a localized $\\mathrm{C-OH}$ single bond.\n\n1.  **Bond Lengths:** In the carboxylic acid, the $\\mathrm{C=O}$ double bond is significantly shorter (approximately $1.20$ Å) than the $\\mathrm{C-OH}$ single bond (approximately $1.36$ Å). In the carboxylate anion, the resonance hybrid model predicts that both carbon-oxygen bonds are equivalent, with a bond order of $1.5$ (the average of a single and a double bond). Experimentally, techniques like X-ray crystallography confirm this prediction: both $\\mathrm{C-O}$ bonds in a carboxylate salt are found to be identical in length, with a value (approximately $1.25$ Å) that is intermediate between a typical $\\mathrm{C=O}$ double bond and a $\\mathrm{C-O}$ single bond.\n\n2.  **Vibrational Frequencies:** Infrared (IR) spectroscopy measures the vibrational frequencies of chemical bonds. Stronger bonds vibrate at higher frequencies. In the carboxylic acid, the IR spectrum shows a distinct, strong absorption band for the $\\mathrm{C=O}$ double bond stretch, typically around $1700-1725 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$. Upon deprotonation to form the carboxylate anion, this characteristic band disappears. It is replaced by two new bands corresponding to the symmetric and asymmetric stretching modes of the equivalent $\\mathrm{C-O}$ bonds. The asymmetric stretch appears at a lower frequency (e.g., $1550-1610 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$), and the symmetric stretch at an even lower frequency (e.g., $1300-1420 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$). This shift to lower frequencies demonstrates that the bonds in the anion are weaker than a pure $\\mathrm{C=O}$ double bond, which is consistent with the resonance hybrid model of bond order $1.5$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} -\\frac{1}{2} & -\\frac{1}{2} & 0 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2944253"}, {"introduction": "The Lewis model beautifully simplifies ionic bonding as a complete transfer of valence electrons, but what are the energetic consequences of this event?
