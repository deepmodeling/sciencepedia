The specified energy level ordering for $\\text{N}_2$ is consistent with experimental and computational results. The premise that the force constant is proportional to bond order is a widely used and valid approximation (related to Badger's rule). The assumption of constant reduced mass is physically sound, as the mass of the removed electron is negligible compared to the nuclear masses. The problem is well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. It is a standard problem in general and physical chemistry that tests the application of fundamental concepts. No flaws are identified.\n\n**Verdict:** The problem is valid.\n\n**Step 3: Solution**\n\nWe begin by determining the molecular orbital configuration for the neutral nitrogen molecule, $\\text{N}_2$. A nitrogen atom has an atomic number of $7$, so it has $7$ electrons. The $\\text{N}_2$ molecule therefore has a total of $14$ electrons. The molecular orbitals are filled in order of increasing energy. The problem states that the contributions of the $2s$ orbitals cancel, which implies the configuration $(\\sigma_{2s})^2(\\sigma_{2s}^*)^2$. This accounts for $4$ of the $10$ valence electrons (the $1s$ core orbitals are ignored as they do not contribute to bonding).\n\nThe remaining $14 - 4 - 4 = 6$ valence electrons (from the $2p$ atomic orbitals) are placed into the molecular orbitals derived from the $2p$ atomic orbitals. The problem specifies the energy ordering for $\\text{N}_2$ as $\\pi_{2p}  \\sigma_{2p}$. The two $\\pi_{2p}$ orbitals, $\\pi_{2p_x}$ and $\\pi_{2p_y}$, are degenerate. Following the Aufbau principle and Hund's rule, these six electrons fill the orbitals as follows: $(\\pi_{2p_x})^2(\\pi_{2p_y})^2(\\sigma_{2p_z})^2$.\n\nThe complete valence shell electronic configuration of $\\text{N}_2$ is therefore:\n$$ (\\sigma_{2s})^2 (\\sigma_{2s}^*)^2 (\\pi_{2p_x})^2 (\\pi_{2p_y})^2 (\\sigma_{2p_z})^2 $$\nThe highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is the $\\sigma_{2p_z}$ orbital.\n\nThe bond order (BO) is defined as:\n$$ \\text{BO} = \\frac{1}{2} (\\text{number of bonding electrons} - \\text{number of antibonding electrons}) $$\nFor $\\text{N}_2$, we count the valence electrons. The bonding electrons are in the $\\sigma_{2s}$, $\\pi_{2p_x}$, $\\pi_{2p_y}$, and $\\sigma_{2p_z}$ orbitals, totaling $2+2+2+2 = 8$. The antibonding electrons are in the $\\sigma_{2s}^*$ orbital, totaling $2$.\n$$ \\text{BO}(\\text{N}_2) = \\frac{1}{2} (8 - 2) = 3 $$\nSince all electrons in the $\\text{N}_2$ molecule are paired, it is diamagnetic.\n\nNext, we consider the molecular cation $\\text{N}_2^{+}$. It is formed by removing one electron from the HOMO of $\\text{N}_2$, which is the $\\sigma_{2p_z}$ orbital. $\\text{N}_2^{+}$ has $14-1 = 13$ electrons. Its valence shell electronic configuration is:\n$$ (\\sigma_{2s})^2 (\\sigma_{2s}^*)^2 (\\pi_{2p_x})^2 (\\pi_{2p_y})^2 (\\sigma_{2p_z})^1 $$\nWe calculate the bond order for $\\text{N}_2^{+}$. The number of bonding electrons is now $2+2+2+1 = 7$. The number of antibonding electrons remains $2$.\n$$ \\text{BO}(\\text{N}_2^{+}) = \\frac{1}{2} (7 - 2) = 2.5 $$\nUpon ionization, the bond order decreases from $3$ to $2.5$. The $\\text{N}_2^{+}$ ion possesses one unpaired electron in the $\\sigma_{2p_z}$ orbital, which makes it paramagnetic.\n\nFinally, we compute the ratio of the fundamental vibrational frequencies, $\\nu(\\text{N}_2^{+})/\\nu(\\text{N}_2)$. Within the harmonic oscillator approximation, the vibrational frequency $\\nu$ is given by:\n$$ \\nu = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{\\mu}} $$\nwhere $k$ is the force constant and $\\mu$ is the reduced mass of the molecule.\n\nThe problem states that $k$ is proportional to the bond order, so we can write $k = C \\times \\text{BO}$, where $C$ is a constant of proportionality. It is also given that the reduced mass $\\mu$ is the same for both $\\text{N}_2$ and $\\text{N}_2^{+}$. We can now form the ratio of the frequencies:\n$$ \\frac{\\nu(\\text{N}_2^{+})}{\\nu(\\text{N}_2)} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{k(\\text{N}_2^{+})}{\\mu(\\text{N}_2^{+})}}}{\\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sqrt{\\frac{k(\\text{N}_2)}{\\mu(\\text{N}_2)}}} $$\nThe terms $\\frac{1}{2\\pi}$ and the reduced masses cancel out, yielding:\n$$ \\frac{\\nu(\\text{N}_2^{+})}{\\nu(\\text{N}_2)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{k(\\text{N}_2^{+})}{k(\\text{N}_2)}} $$\nSubstituting the proportionality relation $k = C \\times \\text{BO}$:\n$$ \\frac{\\nu(\\text{N}_2^{+})}{\\nu(\\text{N}_2)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{C \\times \\text{BO}(\\text{N}_2^{+})}{C \\times \\text{BO}(\\text{N}_2)}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\text{BO}(\\text{N}_2^{+})}{\\text{BO}(\\text{N}_2)}} $$\nWe insert the calculated bond orders, $\\text{BO}(\\text{N}_2) = 3$ and $\\text{BO}(\\text{N}_2^{+}) = 2.5$:\n$$ \\frac{\\nu(\\text{N}_2^{+})}{\\nu(\\text{N}_2)} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2.5}{3}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{5/2}{3}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{6}} $$\nTo obtain the required numerical value, we compute the square root and round to $4$ significant figures:\n$$ \\sqrt{\\frac{5}{6}} \\approx \\sqrt{0.833333...} \\approx 0.9128709... $$\nRounding to $4$ significant figures gives $0.9129$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.9129}$$", "id": "2923234"}]}
