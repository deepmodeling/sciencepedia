The AOs are normalized, so $S_{AA} = S_{BB} = 1$. The overlap between the two AOs is explicitly stated to be zero, $S \\equiv S_{AB} = S_{BA} = 0$.\n\nSubstituting these values into the matrix equation gives:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\alpha_{A} - E  \\beta \\\\ \\beta  \\alpha_{B} - E \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} c_{A} \\\\ c_{B} \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nFor a non-trivial solution (where $c_{A}$ and $c_{B}$ are not both zero), the determinant of the matrix of coefficients must be zero.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO) theory and point-group symmetry. The provided data are consistent and sufficient for a unique solution within the specified model. We will proceed by first addressing the qualitative aspects concerning orbital mixing and then performing the quantitative calculation.\n\nThe problem is divided into two parts. The first part requires a qualitative justification for the selective mixing of atomic orbitals (AOs) in hydrogen fluoride ($\\mathrm{HF}$) based on symmetry and energy considerations. The second part requires a quantitative calculation of the hydrogen $1s$ orbital's contribution to the bonding molecular orbital (MO) within a simplified $2$-level model.\n\nFirst, we analyze the conditions for orbital mixing. According to LCAO theory, for two AOs to form an effective MO, two conditions must be met:\n$1$. The AOs must have the same symmetry with respect to the internuclear axis.\n$2$. The AOs must have comparable energies. The strength of the interaction is inversely proportional to the energy difference between the AOs.\n\nThe $\\mathrm{HF}$ molecule belongs to the $C_{\\infty v}$ point group, with the internuclear axis defined as the $z$-axis. We must determine the irreducible representations (irreps) of the relevant valence AOs in this point group. An AO that is symmetric with respect to rotation about the principal ($z$) axis is designated as $\\sigma$. An AO that is antisymmetric with respect to a $C_2$ rotation perpendicular to the principal axis and has one nodal plane containing the axis is designated as $\\pi$.\nThe hydrogen $1s$ AO is spherically symmetric and thus transforms as the totally symmetric irrep, which is $\\sigma$ (or more precisely, $\\Sigma^+$).\nFor fluorine, the $2s$ AO is also spherically symmetric and has $\\sigma$ symmetry. The $2p_z$ AO lies along the internuclear axis and is also cylindrically symmetric, hence it has $\\sigma$ symmetry. The $2p_x$ and $2p_y$ AOs are perpendicular to the internuclear axis and transform as a degenerate pair belonging to the $\\pi$ irrep.\n\nBased on the symmetry criterion (condition $1$), only orbitals of the same symmetry type can have a non-zero overlap integral and thus can mix. The hydrogen $1s$ orbital has $\\sigma$ symmetry. Therefore, it can mix with the fluorine $2s$ and $2p_z$ orbitals, which also have $\\sigma$ symmetry. The fluorine $2p_x$ and $2p_y$ orbitals have $\\pi$ symmetry. The overlap integral between an orbital of $\\sigma$ symmetry and an orbital of $\\pi$ symmetry is identically zero due to orthogonality. For instance, $\\langle 1s_{\\mathrm{H}} | 2p_{x,\\mathrm{F}} \\rangle = 0$. Consequently, the fluorine $2p_x$ and $2p_y$ orbitals do not mix with the hydrogen $1s$ orbital and become non-bonding $\\pi$ MOs, localized on the fluorine atom.\n\nNext, we consider the energy criterion (condition $2$) to explain why the interaction between H $1s$ and F $2p_z$ is dominant, while the interaction with F $2s$ is minor. The on-site energies, $\\alpha$, which approximate the AO energies, are given for H $1s$ ($\\alpha_{\\mathrm{H}} = -13.6\\,\\mathrm{eV}$) and F $2p$ ($\\alpha_{\\mathrm{F}} = -18.6\\,\\mathrm{eV}$). The energy of the F $2s$ orbital is significantly lower, approximately $-40\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. The energy difference between the interacting orbitals is $|\\alpha_{\\mathrm{H}} - \\alpha_{2p_z,\\mathrm{F}}| = |-13.6 - (-18.6)| = 5.0\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. In contrast, the energy difference with the F $2s$ orbital is $|\\alpha_{\\mathrm{H}} - \\alpha_{2s,\\mathrm{F}}| \\approx |-13.6 - (-40)| = 26.4\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. Because this energy gap is much larger, the mixing between H $1s$ and F $2s$ is much weaker than the mixing between H $1s$ and F $2p_z$. Therefore, the primary components of the bonding $\\sigma$ MO are the H $1s$ and F $2p_z$ orbitals.\n\nNow, we proceed to the quantitative calculation based on the specified $2$-level LCAO model using the basis $\\{ \\lvert 1s_{\\mathrm{H}} \\rangle, \\lvert 2p_{z,\\mathrm{F}} \\rangle \\}$. The molecular orbital wavefunction is $\\lvert \\psi \\rangle = c_{\\mathrm{H}} \\lvert 1s_{\\mathrm{H}} \\rangle + c_{\\mathrm{F}} \\lvert 2p_{z,\\mathrm{F}} \\rangle$.

In homonuclear diatomics of the early second period, including $\\mathrm{N_2}$, the phenomenon of $s$–$p$ mixing is significant. The MOs of $\\sigma_g$ symmetry, derived from the $2s$ and $2p_z$ AOs, interact. This interaction, a manifestation of the general principle that orbitals of the same symmetry can mix, results in the repulsion of their energy levels: the lower-energy $\\sigma_g(2s)$ MO is stabilized (lowered in energy), and the higher-energy $\\sigma_g(2p)$ MO is destabilized (raised in energy). For $\\mathrm{N_2}$, this destabilization is large enough to push the $\\sigma_g(2p)$ level above the $\\pi_u(2p)$ levels, leading to the so-called \"inverted\" MO diagram.\n\nWe must now analyze how this situation is modified in the heteronuclear diatomic $\\mathrm{BN}$.\n1.  **Symmetry Reduction:** The symmetry of $\\mathrm{BN}$ is $\\mathrm{C_{\\infty v}}$, a subgroup of the $\\mathrm{D_{\\infty h}}$ point group of $\\mathrm{N_2}$. The inversion symmetry ($i$) is lost, and thus the $g$ (gerade) and $u$ (ungerade) labels are no longer applicable. Orbitals are classified simply as $\\sigma$ or $\\pi$. The MOs corresponding to the homonuclear $\\sigma_g(2s)$ and $\\sigma_g(2p)$ both transform as the $\\sigma$ irreducible representation in $\\mathrm{C_{\\infty v}}$. As stated in Fact $3$, they are permitted by symmetry to mix. The $\\pi(2p)$ MOs belong to the $\\pi$ representation and do not mix with the $\\sigma$ MOs.\n\n2.  **Orbital Polarization and its Effect on Mixing:** According to Fact $2$, since nitrogen is more electronegative than boron ($\\alpha(\\mathrm{N})  \\alpha(\\mathrm{B})$), bonding MOs are polarized toward the nitrogen atom. This means that the MOs that are bonding combinations of the valence AOs—specifically, the MOs we may qualitatively label \"$\\sigma(2s)$\" and \"$\\sigma(2p)$\"—have larger coefficients on the nitrogen $2s$ and $2p_z$ AOs, respectively, than on the boron AOs.\n\n3.  **Strength of $s$–$p$ Mixing:** The strength of the interaction (mixing) between two orbitals depends inversely on their energy separation. In this case, we are considering the mixing between the \"$\\sigma(2s)$\" MO and the \"$\\sigma(2p)$\" MO. Since both of these MOs are polarized towards nitrogen, their character is predominantly defined by the nitrogen AOs. Consequently, the effective energy gap that governs the strength of their mixing is primarily determined by the energy separation between the $2s$ and $2p$ AOs on the nitrogen atom, which is $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{N}} \\equiv \\alpha_{2p}(\\mathrm{N}) - \\alpha_{2s}(\\mathrm{N})$.\n\n4.  **Conclusion on Orbital Ordering:** Fact $1$ states that the $2s$–$2p$ energy gap is significantly larger on nitrogen than on boron ($\\Delta_{\\mathrm{N}}  \\Delta_{\\mathrm{B}}$). A larger energy gap leads to weaker orbital mixing. Because the mixing in $\\mathrm{BN}$ is governed by the large gap $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{N}}$, the $s$–$p$ mixing will be suppressed, or \"quenched,\" relative to a situation determined by the smaller $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{B}}$ gap. This weak mixing results in a smaller destabilization (upward energy shift) of the $\\sigma(2p)$ MO. In $\\mathrm{N_2}$, the $s$–$p$ mixing is just strong enough to cause the inversion. In $\\mathrm{BN}$, with the mixing being significantly weaker, it is highly plausible that this upward shift will be insufficient to raise the $\\sigma(2p)$ energy level above that of the $\\pi(2p)$ levels. Therefore, the \"non-inverted\" or \"natural\" ordering, where the $\\sigma(2p)$ MO is lower in energy than the $\\pi(2p)$ MOs, is the most likely outcome.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. Inversion persists in $\\mathrm{BN}$ (i.e., $\\pi(2p)$ below $\\sigma(2p)$) because the smaller $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{B}}$ on $\\mathrm{B}$ guarantees strong $s$–$p$ mixing that raises $\\sigma(2p)$ above $\\pi(2p)$, overcoming any heteronuclear polarization.**\nThis assertion is flawed. It correctly notes that $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{B}}$ is small, which would favor strong mixing if the interaction were localized on boron. However, it completely ignores Fact $2$, which states that the relevant bonding MOs are polarized towards nitrogen. Therefore, the properties of nitrogen, not boron, are dominant in controlling the mixing. The argument's premise is incorrect.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. Inversion is unlikely in $\\mathrm{BN}$ (i.e., $\\sigma(2p)$ below $\\pi(2p)$) because heteronuclear polarization puts the bonding $\\sigma(2p)$ primarily on $\\mathrm{N}$, where the larger $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{N}}$ quenches $s$–$p$ mixing, so $\\sigma(2p)$ is not pushed up above $\\pi(2p)$.**\nThis statement correctly synthesizes all the provided facts into a coherent and logical argument. It recognizes that polarization localizes the interacting $\\sigma$ MOs on the nitrogen atom. It then correctly deduces that the large $2s$–$2p$ energy gap on nitrogen ($\\Delta_{\\mathrm{N}}$) leads to weak $s$–$p$ mixing, which in turn is insufficient to cause the energy level inversion. This matches our derivation precisely.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**C. Inversion is guaranteed for any isoelectronic heteronuclear diatomic; thus $\\mathrm{BN}$ must have the same $\\sigma(2p)$–$\\pi(2p)$ ordering as homonuclear $\\mathrm{N_2}$ regardless of $\\alpha_{2s}$–$\\alpha_{2p}$ separations.**\nThis statement is scientifically unsound. First, $\\mathrm{BN}$ ($3+5=8$ valence electrons) is isoelectronic with $\\mathrm{C_2}$, not $\\mathrm{N_2}$ ($5+5=10$ valence electrons). Second, the isoelectronic principle is a heuristic, not a strict law. The orbital ordering is sensitive to the specific parameters of the constituent atoms, such as their electronegativities and AO energy separations, which the problem explicitly provides as the basis for reasoning. Claiming the ordering is independent of these factors is a direct contradiction of fundamental MO theory.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. The ordering cannot be rationalized within LCAO MO theory because $\\sigma$–$\\pi$ mixing becomes allowed in heteronuclear diatomics and completely invalidates symmetry-based arguments, making any prediction impossible without a full correlated calculation.**\nThis statement is based on a false premise. As correctly stated in Fact $3$ of the problem, and as dictated by the character table for the $\\mathrm{C_{\\infty v}}$ point group, orbitals of $\\sigma$ symmetry and $\\pi$ symmetry belong to different irreducible representations. Therefore, the overlap integral between them is zero, and $\\sigma$–$\\pi$ mixing is strictly symmetry-forbidden. The claim that LCAO MO theory is invalidated is therefore baseless. Qualitative predictions are indeed possible and are the entire point of this exercise.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2946458"}]}
