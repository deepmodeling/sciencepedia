This exercise challenges you to resolve why fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine, even though chlorine has a more exothermic electron affinity. To succeed, you must carefully distinguish between the thermochemical basis of Pauling electronegativity, the atomic-property basis of the Mulliken scale, and the underlying factors like atomic size and inter-electronic repulsion that govern all of these properties. [@problem_id:2950406]", "problem": "A recurring observation in the periodic trends of main-group elements is that chlorine ($\\mathrm{Cl}$) has a slightly more exothermic electron affinity than fluorine ($\\mathrm{F}$), yet fluorine is assigned a higher electronegativity than chlorine on both the Pauling and Mulliken scales. Starting from fundamental definitions and well-tested facts, decide which option best rationalizes this combination of trends while remaining consistent with gas-phase thermochemistry and bonding energetics. Let $\\chi$ denote electronegativity, $I$ denote ionization energy, and $A$ denote electron affinity. Select the single best option.\n\nA. The added electron in $\\mathrm{F}$ must enter a compact $2p$ valence shell with high electron density, so short-range electron–electron repulsions make $A(\\mathrm{F})$ less exothermic than $A(\\mathrm{Cl})$, where the electron is accommodated in a more diffuse $3p$ orbital. On the Mulliken scale, $\\chi$ reflects both $I$ and $A$, and the substantially larger $I(\\mathrm{F})$ more than compensates for the slightly smaller $A(\\mathrm{F})$ compared to chlorine.

Chlorine has a lower effective nuclear charge than fluorine, and the Mulliken scale depends only on $A$. Therefore, the larger $A(\\mathrm{Cl})$ implies $\\chi_{\\mathrm{Cl}}\\chi_{\\mathrm{F}}$ on Mulliken, contradicting Pauling only because the latter is based on arbitrary units.\n\nC. Fluorine’s homonuclear bond $\\text{F-F}$ is exceptionally strong, which boosts its Pauling electronegativity, whereas the Mulliken scale depends predominantly on $A$. Thus, since $A(\\mathrm{Cl})A(\\mathrm{F})$, chlorine should be more electronegative on Mulliken even if the Pauling value for fluorine is higher.\n\nD.

Relativistic contraction of the $2p$ shell in fluorine lowers its electron affinity, and the Mulliken scale uses only $I$, ignoring $A$.

The task is to provide a correct and consistent rationalization for these observations.\n\nThe validity of the premises is confirmed by experimental data.\n1.  Electron Affinity ($A$): The energy released when a gaseous atom gains an electron. $A(\\mathrm{F}) \\approx 328.0 \\, \\mathrm{kJ/mol}$ and $A(\\mathrm{Cl}) \\approx 349.0 \\, \\mathrm{kJ/mol}$.

Thus, $\\chi_P(\\mathrm{F}) > \\chi_P(\\mathrm{Cl})$.\n4.  Mulliken Electronegativity ($\\chi_M$): This scale is defined as the average of the first ionization energy and the electron affinity, $\\chi_M = k(I_1 + A)$, where $k$ is a proportionality constant.\n    For fluorine: $I_1(\\mathrm{F}) + A(\\mathrm{F}) \\approx 1681.0 + 328.0 = 2009.0 \\, \\mathrm{kJ/mol}$.\n    For chlorine: $I_1(\\mathrm{Cl}) + A(\\mathrm{Cl}) \\approx 1251.2 + 349.0 = 1600.2 \\, \\mathrm{kJ/mol}$.\n    Since $2009.0 > 1600.2$, it follows that $\\chi_M(\\mathrm{F}) > \\chi_M(\\mathrm{Cl})$.\n\nThe problem is scientifically sound and well-posed. We will now analyze each option.\n\nA. This option presents three distinct claims that must be evaluated.\n1.  On the electron affinity ($A$) of $\\mathrm{F}$ versus $\\mathrm{Cl}$: The statement attributes the lower exothermicity of $A(\\mathrm{F})$ to the incoming electron entering a compact $2p$ shell with high electron density, leading to greater electron–electron repulsion compared to the more diffuse $3p$ orbital in chlorine. This is the standard and accepted explanation for this periodic trend anomaly. The higher effective nuclear charge of fluorine is more than offset by this destabilizing repulsive effect. This part is correct.\n2.  On Mulliken electronegativity ($\\chi_M$): The statement correctly notes that $\\chi_M$ depends on both $I$ and $A$. It then argues that the substantially larger ionization energy of fluorine, $I(\\mathrm{F})$, more than compensates for its slightly smaller electron affinity, $A(\\mathrm{F})$. As demonstrated by the calculations above, the difference in ionization energies ($\\Delta I_1 \\approx 430 \\, \\mathrm{kJ/mol}$) is far greater than the difference in electron affinities ($\\Delta A \\approx 21 \\, \\mathrm{kJ/mol}$). The sum $(I_1+A)$ is therefore larger for fluorine. This part is correct.\n3.  On Pauling electronegativity ($\\chi_P$): The statement correctly identifies that the Pauling scale is based on bond-energy deviations for heteronuclear bonds, $D(X\\text{-Y})$, relative to the homonuclear bond energies, $D(X\\text{-X})$ and $D(Y\\text{-Y})$. It states that for bonds to fluorine, $X\\text{-F}$, these deviations are large due to strong polarity and short bond lengths, which lead to exceptionally strong bonds. This excess stabilization is what gives fluorine its high $\\chi_P$ value. This part is also correct.\nBecause all three components of the explanation are scientifically sound and directly address the problem, this option provides a complete and accurate rationalization.\nVerdict: **Correct**\n\nB. This option states that the Mulliken scale depends only on $A$. This is fundamentally incorrect. The Mulliken electronegativity, $\\chi_M$, is defined as being proportional to the sum of ionization energy and electron affinity, $\\chi_M \\propto (I_1 + A)$. The conclusion that $\\chi_{\\mathrm{Cl}}\\chi_{\\mathrm{F}}$ on the Mulliken scale is therefore based on a false premise and is contrary to the facts derived from the proper definition.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**\n\nC. This option makes two incorrect claims. First, it states that the fluorine homonuclear bond, $\\text{F-F}$, is exceptionally strong. This is factually incorrect; the $\\text{F-F}$ bond ($159 \\, \\mathrm{kJ/mol}$) is anomalously weak for a halogen, weaker than the $\\text{Cl-Cl}$ bond ($243 \\, \\mathrm{kJ/mol}$), primarily due to repulsion between the dense lone pairs on the small atoms. Second, it claims that the Mulliken scale depends predominantly on $A$. As shown in the analysis for option A, the ionization energy $I$ has a much larger absolute value and a much larger variation between $\\mathrm{F}$ and $\\mathrm{Cl}$ than the electron affinity $A$. Therefore, the sum is dominated by the ionization energy term.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**\n\nD. This option incorrectly describes the basis of the Pauling electronegativity scale. The Pauling scale was originally derived from thermochemical data for gas-phase bond dissociation energies, not from properties measured in aqueous solution like acidities or solvation energies. While a substance's behavior in water is influenced by electronegativity, the scale itself is not calibrated against such properties. The disproportionate stabilization of the $\\mathrm{F}^-$ ion in water is a real phenomenon due to its high charge density, but it is not the reason for fluorine's high Pauling electronegativity.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**\n\nE. This option contains several errors. First, it invokes relativistic contraction of the $2p$ shell as the reason for fluorine's lower electron affinity. Relativistic effects are significant for heavy elements, not for a light element like fluorine ($Z=9$). The size of the $2p$ shell is governed primarily by electrostatic principles (nuclear charge and shielding). Second, it repeats the falsehood that the Mulliken scale uses only $I$, ignoring $A$. Third, it posits resonance stabilization in $\\text{F}_2$ as a factor elevating fluorine's Pauling electronegativity. The simple diatomic molecule $\\text{F}_2$ is best described by a single covalent bond and does not exhibit significant resonance. This is a misapplication of the concept of resonance.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**\n\nIn summary, option A is the only one that provides a completely accurate and comprehensive explanation consistent with the fundamental principles of chemistry and empirical data.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2950406"}, {"introduction": "Predicting chemical reactivity often requires a sophisticated analysis of competing factors, and relying on a single periodic trend like electronegativity can be misleading.

The gas-phase deprotonation enthalpy can be expressed via another cycle involving bond dissociation enthalpy ($\\text{BDE}$), electron affinity ($\\text{EA}$), and the ionization potential of hydrogen ($\\text{IP(H)}$):\n\n$\\Delta H^\\circ_{\\mathrm{acid}}(\\mathrm{g}) = \\text{BDE}(\\text{A-H}) - \\text{EA}(\\text{A}\\cdot) + \\text{IP(H)}$\n\nLet us analyze the contributing factors:\n\n1.  **Gas-Phase Acidity**:\n    *   **Bond Dissociation Enthalpy (BDE)**: The $\\text{O-H}$ bond in a water molecule is significantly stronger than the $\\text{S-H}$ bond in hydrogen sulfide. The BDE for the first hydrogen is $\\text{BDE(HO-H)} \\approx 492\\ \\mathrm{kJ/mol}$, whereas $\\text{BDE(HS-H)} \\approx 363\\ \\mathrm{kJ/mol}$. The much lower BDE of the $\\text{S-H}$ bond means that breaking it is far less enthalpically demanding. This factor strongly favors higher acidity for $\\text{H}_2\\text{S}$. The physical reason for the weaker bond is the larger size of the sulfur $3p$ orbital compared to the oxygen $2p$ orbital, leading to poorer orbital overlap with the compact hydrogen $1s$ orbital and a longer, weaker bond.\n    *   **Electron Affinity (EA)**: This term relates to the stability of the resulting conjugate base. The electron affinity of the hydroxyl radical is $\\text{EA}(\\cdot\\text{OH}) \\approx 176\\ \\mathrm{kJ/mol}$, while for the hydrosulfidyl radical it is $\\text{EA}(\\cdot\\text{SH}) \\approx 221\\ \\mathrm{kJ/mol}$. The more exothermic electron affinity for $\\cdot\\text{SH}$ indicates that the $\\text{HS}^-$ anion is more stable in the gas phase than the $\\text{HO}^-$ anion. This is due to the larger size and greater polarizability of sulfur, which allows for better delocalization of the negative charge. This factor also favors higher acidity for $\\text{H}_2\\text{S}$.\n    *   Overall, the gas-phase acidity of $\\text{H}_2\\text{S}$ is substantially greater than that of $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$, primarily due to the dominant effect of the weaker $\\text{S-H}$ bond.\n\n2.  **Solvation Effects**:\n    *   **Anion Solvation**: The hydroxide ion, $\\text{HO}^-$, is smaller and has a higher charge density than the hydrosulfide ion, $\\text{HS}^-$. Consequently, $\\text{HO}^-$ interacts much more strongly with polar water molecules via ion-dipole forces and hydrogen bonding. The Gibbs free energy of hydration is significantly more negative for $\\text{HO}^-$ ($\\approx -430\\ \\mathrm{kJ/mol}$) than for $\\text{HS}^-$ ($\\approx -340\\ \\mathrm{kJ/mol}$). This stronger solvation of $\\text{HO}^-$ preferentially stabilizes the product of water deprotonation, a factor that, by itself, would make $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ a stronger acid.\n    *   **Neutral Molecule Solvation**: The solvation of $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ in liquid water is, by definition, very strong. The solvation of $\\text{H}_2\\text{S}$ in water is much weaker. The difference, $-[\\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{solv}}(\\text{H}_2\\text{S}) - \\Delta G^\\circ_{\\mathrm{solv}}(\\text{H}_2\\text{O})]$, is a term that favors the acidity of $\\text{H}_2\\text{S}$.\n\n**Conclusion**: The experimental observation that $\\text{H}_2\\text{S}$ is a stronger acid than $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ in water implies that the gas-phase factors (predominantly the much weaker $\\text{S-H}$ bond) are the dominant effects, outweighing the opposing effect from the more favorable solvation of the $\\text{HO}^-$ anion. A naive prediction based solely on oxygen's higher electronegativity fails because it does not account for these dominant thermodynamic contributions.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option:\n\n**A. The substantially lower bond dissociation enthalpy of $\\text{S-H}$ relative to $\\text{O-H}$, arising from poorer overlap between the hydrogen $1s$ orbital and the larger, more diffuse $\\mathrm{S}\\ 3p$ valence orbitals (and the longer equilibrium bond length), reduces the enthalpic cost of deprotonation; this effect outweighs the opposing trend suggested by sulfur’s lower electronegativity.**\nThis statement is precise and correct.

The conjugate base $\\text{HS}^-$ is larger and more polarizable than $\\text{HO}^-$; in the gas phase, this increased polarizability allows the excess electron density to be more diffuse and better stabilized by electronic correlation and dispersion, lowering the intrinsic deprotonation free energy.**\nThis statement is also correct. The stability of the conjugate base is a crucial component of acidity. In the gas phase, the larger size and higher polarizability of $\\text{HS}^-$ compared to $\\text{HO}^-$ results in greater charge dispersal and stabilization. This contributes to the more favorable electron affinity of the $\\cdot\\text{SH}$ radical and thus to a lower gas-phase deprotonation energy for $\\text{H}_2\\text{S}$. This is a valid contributing part of the overall rationale.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\n**C. In water, $\\text{HO}^-$ is less strongly solvated than $\\text{HS}^-$ because its charge is concentrated on a smaller, harder base; therefore, differential hydration stabilizes $\\text{HS}^-$ more, enhancing the acidity of $\\text{H}_2\\text{S}$.**\nThis statement contains a fundamental factual error. Due to its smaller size and higher charge density, the $\\text{HO}^-$ ion is *more*, not less, strongly solvated in water than the $\\text{HS}^-$ ion. The premise is false, and therefore the conclusion is unsupported and incorrect. The actual differential hydration favors the acidity of $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$, opposing the observed trend.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**D. The availability of low-lying $\\mathrm{S}\\ 3d$ orbitals permits $\\text{HS}^-$ to delocalize negative charge via $d$-orbital participation, stabilizing the conjugate base relative to $\\text{HO}^-$ and thereby increasing the acidity of $\\text{H}_2\\text{S}$.**\nThis statement invokes the concept of $d$-orbital participation for a second-row main group element. Modern high-level electronic structure calculations have demonstrated that the energetic contribution of $3d$ orbitals to the bonding and stability of such species is negligible. The stability of $\\text{HS}^-$ is adequately explained by considering only valence $s$ and $p$ orbitals. This rationale is outdated and scientifically unsound.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\n**E.

It correctly identifies the simple but incorrect prediction based on electronegativity. It then correctly states that the periodic trends in bond strength (Option A) and anion stability related to size/polarizability (Option B) are the dominant factors that determine the actual chemical behavior.
