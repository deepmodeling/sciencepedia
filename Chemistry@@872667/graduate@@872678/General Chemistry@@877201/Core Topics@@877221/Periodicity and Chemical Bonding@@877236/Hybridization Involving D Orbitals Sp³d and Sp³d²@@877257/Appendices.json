It is a well-posed, scientifically sound exercise in theoretical chemistry. Proceeding to solution.\n\nThe solution is a straightforward application of symmetry and orthonormality constraints. The atomic orbitals comprising the basis set, {$s, p_x, p_y, p_z, d_{z^2}, d_{x^2-y^2}$}, are assumed to be orthonormal.\n\nFirst, we address the construction of the axis-aligned $d$-orbital combinations. The $E_g$ representation in $O_h$ symmetry is two-dimensional. A standard orthonormal basis for this representation is given by the atomic orbitals {$d_{z^2}, d_{x^2-y^2}$}. The problem asks for the construction of three normalized functions, which we denote $\\delta_u$, proportional to the functions $3u^2-r^2$ for $u \\in \\{x, y, z\\}$. Since these three functions lie in a two-dimensional subspace, they must be linearly dependent.\nLet us define $\\delta_z$ to be identical to the basis orbital $d_{z^2}$, which is proportional to $3z^2-r^2$.\n$$ \\delta_z = d_{3z^2-r^2} = d_{z^2} $$\nThe three functions $3u^2-r^2$ are related by symmetry. Furthermore, their sum is identically zero:\n$$ (3x^2-r^2) + (3y^2-r^2) + (3z^2-r^2) = 3(x^2+y^2+z^2) - 3r^2 = 3r^2-3r^2=0 $$\nSince the normalization constant for each function $3u^2-r^2$ is identical by symmetry, the normalized orbitals $\\delta_u$ must satisfy the same linear dependence:\n$$ \\delta_x + \\delta_y + \\delta_z = 0 $$\nBy symmetry of the octahedral group, $\\delta_x$ and $\\delta_y$ must have the same projection onto $\\delta_z = d_{z^2}$. We can write them as linear combinations of the basis {$d_{z^2}, d_{x^2-y^2}$}:\n$$ \\delta_x = \\alpha d_{z^2} + \\beta d_{x^2-y^2} $$\n$$ \\delta_y = \\alpha d_{z^2} - \\beta d_{x^2-y^2} $$\nThe sign of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ coefficient is opposite because a $C_4$ rotation about the $z$-axis maps $x \\to y$ but $d_{x^2-y^2} \\to d_{y^2-x^2} = -d_{x^2-y^2}$.\nSubstituting these into the linear dependency equation:\n$$ (\\alpha d_{z^2} + \\beta d_{x^2-y^2}) + (\\alpha d_{z^2} - \\beta d_{x^2-y^2}) + d_{z^2} = 0 $$\n$$ (2\\alpha + 1) d_{z^2} = 0 \\implies \\alpha = -\\frac{1}{2} $$\nThe normalization condition for $\\delta_x$ requires $\\langle \\delta_x | \\delta_x \\rangle = 1$. As the basis is orthonormal, this gives:\n$$ \\alpha^2 + \\beta^2 = 1 $$\n$$ \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^2 + \\beta^2 = 1 \\implies \\frac{1}{4} + \\beta^2 = 1 \\implies \\beta^2 = \\frac{3}{4} $$\nChoosing the positive root, $\\beta = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.

It correctly identifies the relevant valence orbitals and the fundamental principles of Molecular Orbital (MO) theory that govern orbital interactions.

A definite answer can be derived from established chemical principles.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is stated in precise, objective language. Terms like \"energy mismatch\" and \"spatial overlap\" are cornerstones of quantum chemistry and free of subjective interpretation.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is valid. It is a well-formulated question based on sound chemical principles. I will now proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n**Derivation**\n\nTo determine which orbital mixing is favored, we must analyze the two interactions—P($3p$)-F($2p$) and P($3d$)-F($2p$)—against the established criteria of energy proximity and spatial overlap. Symmetry is a prerequisite for any interaction but does not determine its strength. Both p-p and d-p interactions can be symmetry-allowed in the $\\mathrm{PF_5}$ geometry.\n\n**1. Energy Mismatch ($\\Delta E$)**\n\nThe strength of an orbital interaction is inversely related to the energy difference, $\\Delta E$, between the combining atomic orbitals (AOs). Let us consider the approximate valence orbital ionization energies (VOIEs), which are a good measure of orbital energies in a bonding context.\n\n- **Fluorine (F)**: The $2p$ orbital energy is very low due to fluorine's high electronegativity. Its VOIE is approximately $-18.7 \\, \\mathrm{eV}$.\n- **Phosphorus (P)**:\n    - The $3p$ orbital energy is significantly higher. Its VOIE is approximately $-10.2 \\, \\mathrm{eV}$.\n    - The $3d$ orbitals are not occupied in the ground state of the phosphorus atom. Their energy is very high, an unbound state with positive energy (e.g., $\\approx +1.6 \\, \\mathrm{eV}$ for a neutral P atom). While the effective positive charge on phosphorus in $\\mathrm{PF_5}$ causes orbital contraction and energy stabilization, the $3d$ orbitals remain at a much higher energy than the $3s$ and $3p$ orbitals.\n\n- **Energy Gap Comparison**:\n    - For P($3p$)-F($2p$): $\\Delta E_{p-p} \\approx |-10.2 \\, \\mathrm{eV} - (-18.7 \\, \\mathrm{eV})| = 8.5 \\, \\mathrm{eV}$. This is a substantial, yet typical, energy gap for the formation of a polar covalent bond.\n    - For P($3d$)-F($2p$): $\\Delta E_{d-p} \\approx |(\\text{high positive energy}) - (-18.7 \\, \\mathrm{eV})| \\gg 18.7 \\, \\mathrm{eV}$. This energy gap is enormous.\n\nAccording to perturbation theory, the stabilization energy from mixing is proportional to $S^2/\\Delta E$, where $S$ is the overlap integral. The vast energy difference, $\\Delta E_{d-p}$, makes the energetic contribution from P($3d$)-F($2p$) mixing negligible compared to P($3p$)-F($2p$) mixing.\n\n**2. Spatial Overlap ($S$)**\n\nSubstantial bonding interaction requires significant overlap of the wavefunctions in the internuclear region.\n\n- **P($3p$) and F($2p$) Overlap**: The phosphorus $3p$ orbital is a valence orbital. Although it belongs to the $n=3$ shell and is thus more diffuse than the fluorine $2p$ orbital ($n=2$), their radial distributions are of a comparable scale, allowing for effective overlap at typical P-F bond distances (approx. $1.5-1.6 \\, \\mathrm{\\AA}$).\n- **P($3d$) and F($2p$) Overlap**: The phosphorus $3d$ orbitals are extremely diffuse. Their radial probability maxima lie at a much greater distance from the nucleus than the P-F bond length. The compact F($2p$) orbital sits in a region where the amplitude of the P($3d$) wavefunction is very small. Consequently, the spatial overlap integral, $S$, between a P($3d$) orbital and an F($2p$) orbital is exceedingly small.\n\n**Conclusion on Mixing and Hybridization**\n\nBoth the energy and overlap criteria strongly disfavor the participation of phosphorus $3d$ orbitals in the primary valence bonding of $\\mathrm{PF_5}$. The mixing of P($3d$) and F($2p$) orbitals is negligible. The dominant $\\sigma$-bonding interactions must therefore arise from the mixing of phosphorus $3s$ and $3p$ orbitals with the fluorine $2p$ orbitals.\n\nThe classical $sp^3d$ hybridization model is predicated on the significant mixing of one $s$, three $p$, and one $d$ orbital of the central atom. As our analysis shows, the energetic cost to promote and involve the $3d$ orbital is prohibitive, and its spatial characteristics lead to poor overlap. Thus, the $sp^3d$ model is not a physically meaningful or energetically reasonable description of the bonding in $\\mathrm{PF_5}$. More accurate models, such as the 3-center-4-electron (3c-4e) bond model for the axial positions, use only P $s$ and $p$ orbitals and are consistent with these first principles.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n**A. The phosphorus $3p$ and fluorine $2p$ orbitals mix strongly, whereas phosphorus $3d$ and fluorine $2p$ mixing is negligible due to both a large energy gap and poor overlap; therefore, classical $sp^3d$ hybrids are not an energetically meaningful description of $\\mathrm{PF_5}$.**\nThis statement accurately reflects the analysis. The P($3p$)-F($2p$) interaction is the primary one, while the P($3d$)-F($2p$) interaction is negligible for precisely the two reasons given: a large energy gap and poor overlap. The conclusion that $sp^3d$ hybridization is a poor model is a direct and correct consequence of this fact.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The phosphorus $3d$ and fluorine $2p$ orbitals mix more strongly than phosphorus $3p$ and fluorine $2p$, because $d$ orbitals offer higher angular overlap; this justifies $sp^3d$ hybridization as the dominant bonding model in $\\mathrm{PF_5}$.**\nThis statement is factually incorrect. The P($3d$)-F($2p$) mixing is vastly weaker, not stronger. The argument about \"higher angular overlap\" is a red herring that conveniently ignores the dominant and unfavorable factors of energy and radial overlap. This represents an outdated and flawed understanding.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Both phosphorus $3d$–fluorine $2p$ and phosphorus $3p$–fluorine $2p$ pairs mix comparably, since symmetry allows both interactions; energy mismatch is not the controlling factor if any overlap exists.**\nThis statement is deeply flawed. The assertion of comparable mixing is false. It fundamentally misunderstands MO theory by claiming that symmetry allowance is sufficient for strong interaction and by wrongly dismissing the critical role of the energy gap ($\\Delta E$). A large energy gap always leads to weak interaction.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Phosphorus $3d$–fluorine $2p$ mixing is weak for equatorial bonds in trigonal bipyramidal $\\mathrm{PF_5}$ but becomes dominant for axial bonds because the $d_{z^2}$ orbital aligns with the molecular axis; thus $sp^3d$ hybridization is selectively valid for axial bonds only.**\nThis statement is incorrect. The fundamental issues of high energy and diffuse character apply to all P($3d$) orbitals, including the $d_{z^2}$ orbital. Favorable symmetry alignment for the axial bonds does not overcome these prohibitive factors to make the interaction \"dominant\". The conclusion that $sp^3d$ hybridization would be \"selectively valid\" is also illogical. Hybridization is a model of orbital preparation on the central atom for all its bonds.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2941498"}, {"introduction": "Having demonstrated the energetic implausibility of the $sp^3d$ model for $\\mathrm{PF_5}$, we turn to a more physically sound alternative: the three-center four-electron ($3\\text{c-}4\\text{e}$) bond.

Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory places five electron domains around phosphorus in $\\mathrm{PF_5}$ in a trigonal bipyramidal arrangement to minimize electron pair repulsions. A traditional orbital-label description calls this $sp^3d$ hybridization for the central atom to generate five oriented hybrids, though modern wavefunction analyses show minimal true $d$-orbital participation for second-row and third-row main-group hypervalent species. For bonding analysis, Molecular Orbital (MO) theory provides a robust picture, especially for hypervalent bonds.\n\nIn the trigonal bipyramidal structure, there are two axial fluorine atoms colinear with the central phosphorus along one axis and three equatorial fluorine atoms in the perpendicular plane. The three equatorial $\\mathrm{P-F}$ bonds can be treated, to a first approximation, as localized two-center two-electron $\\sigma$ bonds. In contrast, the two axial $\\mathrm{P-F}$ interactions are best treated as a linear three-center four-electron ($3\\text{c}-4\\text{e}$) system.\n\nConstruct the $3\\text{c}-4\\text{e}$ MO scheme for the axial framework. Combine the $\\sigma$-symmetry orbitals directed along the axis: one from each axial fluorine (for example, the $\\mathrm{F}$ $p_z$ orbitals) and an appropriate central orbital on $\\mathrm{P}$ (often a $p_z$-like function oriented along the same axis; the $sp^3d$ label is a formal bookkeeping of orientation). The linear combination of these three atomic orbitals produces three molecular orbitals by symmetry: one fully in-phase bonding MO, one nonbonding MO (typically with a node at the central atom or with balanced phases such that net bonding is zero), and one out-of-phase antibonding MO.\n\nElectron counting for the axial framework: each $\\mathrm{P-F}$ single-bond domain would nominally contribute two electrons if localized, thus the axial triatomic framework possesses $4$ electrons to place in the set of three MOs. Filling proceeds from lowest to highest energy: the bonding MO receives $2$ electrons, the nonbonding MO receives $2$ electrons, and the antibonding MO remains empty. The bond order in MO theory is defined as\n$$\n\\text{bond order} = \\frac{N_{\\text{bonding}} - N_{\\text{antibonding}}}{2}.\n$$\nFor the entire three-center framework, the count gives $N_{\\text{bonding}} = 2$ and $N_{\\text{antibonding}} = 0$, so the net axial framework bond order is\n$$\n\\text{BO}_{\\text{axial framework}} = \\frac{2 - 0}{2} = 1.\n$$\nBecause this one unit of bond order is symmetrically delocalized over two equivalent $\\mathrm{P-F}$ axial contacts, the effective bond order per axial $\\mathrm{P-F}$ is\n$$\n\\text{BO}_{\\text{axial (per bond)}} = \\frac{1}{2}.\n$$\n\nFor the equatorial $\\mathrm{P-F}$ bonds, treated as localized two-center two-electron $\\sigma$ bonds, the standard MO picture of a two-center bond yields a bond order of approximately $1$ per equatorial $\\mathrm{P-F}$ interaction (ignoring minor polarization and hyperconjugative effects). Thus,\n$$\n\\text{BO}_{\\text{equatorial}} \\approx 1.\n$$\n\nRelating bond order to bond strength, a higher bond order generally correlates with a larger bond dissociation energy (BDE) when other structural and electronic factors are held constant. In a trigonal bipyramid, equatorial positions experience fewer $90^{\\circ}$ interactions than axial positions: each axial ligand has three $90^{\\circ}$ interactions to the equatorial ligands, while each equatorial ligand has only two such $90^{\\circ}$ interactions and two $120^{\\circ}$ interactions to its equatorial neighbors. This reduction in repulsive interactions for equatorial bonds is consistent with their being shorter and stronger in many trigonal bipyramidal hypervalent species. Therefore, with $\\text{BO}_{\\text{equatorial}} \\approx 1$ and $\\text{BO}_{\\text{axial}} \\approx \\tfrac{1}{2}$, one expects\n$$\n\\text{BDE}_{\\text{equatorial}} > \\text{BDE}_{\\text{axial}}.\n$$\n\nFinally, consider possible dynamic effects. Trigonal bipyramidal molecules often undergo Berry pseudorotation, which exchanges axial and equatorial positions rapidly at ambient conditions. However, instantaneous bond characteristics and site-selective reactivity trends still reflect the weaker, longer axial $\\mathrm{P-F}$ interactions relative to equatorial ones, in line with the $3\\text{c}-4\\text{e}$ description.\n\nOption-by-option analysis:\n\nA. States that each axial $\\mathrm{P-F}$ has effective bond order $\\tfrac{1}{2}$, each equatorial $\\mathrm{P-F}$ has bond order approximately $1$, and axial BDE is smaller than equatorial BDE. This matches the $3\\text{c}-4\\text{e}$ MO analysis and the correlation between bond order and strength. Verdict: Correct.\n\nB. Reverses the roles of axial and equatorial bonds, assigning axial bond order $\\approx 1$ and equatorial $\\tfrac{1}{2}$, and predicts larger axial BDE. This contradicts the three-center MO electron counting and known structural trends. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nC. Assigns approximately equal bond orders of $\\tfrac{1}{2}$ to both axial and equatorial bonds and equal BDEs. Equatorial bonds are not part of a $3\\text{c}-4\\text{e}$ delocalized framework and are well described as two-center bonds with bond order near $1$. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nD. Assigns bond order $\\approx 1$ to both axial and equatorial bonds but attributes a smaller axial BDE solely to $90^{\\circ}$ repulsions. While the relative BDE trend is in the right direction, the premise that axial and equatorial bond orders are both near $1$ contradicts the $3\\text{c}-4\\text{e}$ analysis, where axial bonds have effective bond order $\\tfrac{1}{2}$. Verdict: Incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the single best statement is option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2941538"}]}
