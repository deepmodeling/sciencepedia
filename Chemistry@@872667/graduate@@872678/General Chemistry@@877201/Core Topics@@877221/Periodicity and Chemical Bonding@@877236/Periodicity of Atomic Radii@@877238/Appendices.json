The errors $\\varepsilon_{i}$ are assumed to be independent and have zero mean. The method of least squares seeks to find the value of $\\Delta_{s}$ that minimizes the sum of the squared residuals, $S$:\n$$S(\\Delta_s) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\varepsilon_i^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (d_{i}^{\\mathrm{meas}} - d_{i}^{(s)} - \\Delta_s)^2$$\nwhere $N$ is the number of data points (i.e., the number of crystals). To find the minimum, we differentiate $S$ with respect to $\\Delta_s$ and set the result to zero.\n$$\\frac{dS}{d\\Delta_s} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{d}{d\\Delta_s} (d_{i}^{\\mathrm{meas}} - d_{i}^{(s)} - \\Delta_s)^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} 2(d_{i}^{\\mathrm{meas}} - d_{i}^{(s)} - \\Delta_s)(-1) = -2 \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (d_{i}^{\\mathrm{meas}} - d_{i}^{(s)} - \\Delta_s)$$\nSetting this derivative to zero gives the estimator $\\widehat{\\Delta}_{s}$:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (d_{i}^{\\mathrm{meas}} - d_{i}^{(s)} - \\widehat{\\Delta}_{s}) = 0$$\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{N} (d_{i}^{\\mathrm{meas}} - d_{i}^{(s)}) - \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\widehat{\\Delta}_{s} = 0$$\nSince $\\widehat{\\Delta}_{s}$ is a constant for all $i$, $\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\widehat{\\Delta}_{s} = N\\widehat{\\Delta}_{s}$.\n$$N\\widehat{\\Delta}_{s} = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (d_{i}^{\\mathrm{meas}} - d_{i}^{(s)})$$\nThe closed-form least-squares estimator for the offset is thus the sample mean of the differences between the measured separations and the sums of the tabulated radii:\n$$\\widehat{\\Delta}_{s} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (d_{i}^{\\mathrm{meas}} - d_{i}^{(s)})$$\n\nNow, we address Tasks $2$ and $3$, which require computing the offsets for the Shannon and Pauling scales and then finding their difference. The quantity of interest is $\\widehat{\\Delta}_{\\mathrm{Shannon}} - \\widehat{\\Delta}_{\\mathrm{Pauling}}$. Using the derived estimator:\n$$\\widehat{\\Delta}_{\\mathrm{Shannon}} - \\widehat{\\Delta}_{\\mathrm{Pauling}} = \\left( \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (d_{i}^{\\mathrm{meas}} - d_{i}^{(\\mathrm{Sh})}) \\right) - \\left( \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (d_{i}^{\\mathrm{meas}} - d_{i}^{(\\mathrm{Pa})}) \\right)$$\nThe expression simplifies by combining the sums:\n$$\\widehat{\\Delta}_{\\mathrm{Shannon}} - \\widehat{\\Delta}_{\\mathrm{Pauling}} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} [ (d_{i}^{\\mathrm{meas}} - d_{i}^{(\\mathrm{Sh})}) - (d_{i}^{\\mathrm{meas}} - d_{i}^{(\\mathrm{Pa})}) ] = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} (d_{i}^{(\\mathrm{Pa})} - d_{i}^{(\\mathrm{Sh})})$$\nThis shows that the relative offset between the two scales depends only on the difference in their tabulated radii sums, not on the experimental lattice parameters. We have $N=5$ compounds. Let us calculate the term $d_{i}^{(\\mathrm{Pa})} - d_{i}^{(\\mathrm{Sh})}$ for each compound $i$. All values are in picometers (pm).\n\nFor LiF:\n$d^{(\\mathrm{Pa})} = r_{\\mathrm{Li}^+}^{(\\mathrm{Pa})} + r_{\\mathrm{F}^-}^{(\\mathrm{Pa})} = 76 + 131 = 207$\n$d^{(\\mathrm{Sh})} = r_{\\mathrm{Li}^+}^{(\\mathrm{Sh})} + r_{\\mathrm{F}^-}^{(\\mathrm{Sh})} = 90 + 133 = 223$\n$d^{(\\mathrm{Pa})} - d^{(\\mathrm{Sh})} = 207 - 223 = -16$\n\nFor NaCl:\n$d^{(\\mathrm{Pa})} = r_{\\mathrm{Na}^+}^{(\\mathrm{Pa})} + r_{\\mathrm{Cl}^-}^{(\\mathrm{Pa})} = 102 + 181 = 283$\n$d^{(\\mathrm{Sh})} = r_{\\mathrm{Na}^+}^{(\\mathrm{Sh})} + r_{\\mathrm{Cl}^-}^{(\\mathrm{Sh})} = 116 + 181 = 297$\n$d^{(\\mathrm{Pa})} - d^{(\\mathrm{Sh})} = 283 - 297 = -14$\n\nFor KBr:\n$d^{(\\mathrm{Pa})} = r_{\\mathrm{K}^+}^{(\\mathrm{Pa})} + r_{\\mathrm{Br}^-}^{(\\mathrm{Pa})} = 138 + 196 = 334$\n$d^{(\\mathrm{Sh})} = r_{\\mathrm{K}^+}^{(\\mathrm{Sh})} + r_{\\mathrm{Br}^-}^{(\\mathrm{Sh})} = 152 + 196 = 348$\n$d^{(\\mathrm{Pa})} - d^{(\\mathrm{Sh})} = 334 - 348 = -14$\n\nFor RbCl:\n$d^{(\\mathrm{Pa})} = r_{\\mathrm{Rb}^+}^{(\\mathrm{Pa})} + r_{\\mathrm{Cl}^-}^{(\\mathrm{Pa})} = 152 + 181 = 333$\n$d^{(\\mathrm{Sh})} = r_{\\mathrm{Rb}^+}^{(\\mathrm{Sh})} + r_{\\mathrm{Cl}^-}^{(\\mathrm{Sh})} = 166 + 181 = 347$\n$d^{(\\mathrm{Pa})} - d^{(\\mathrm{Sh})} = 333 - 347 = -14$\n\nFor KI:\n$d^{(\\mathrm{Pa})} = r_{\\mathrm{K}^+}^{(\\mathrm{Pa})} + r_{\\mathrm{I}^-}^{(\\mathrm{Pa})} = 138 + 220 = 358$\n$d^{(\\mathrm{Sh})} = r_{\\mathrm{K}^+}^{(\\mathrm{Sh})} + r_{\\mathrm{I}^-}^{(\\mathrm{Sh})} = 152 + 220 = 372$\n$d^{(\\mathrm{Pa})} - d^{(\\mathrm{Sh})} = 358 - 372 = -14$\n\nNow we sum these differences and divide by $N=5$:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{5} (d_{i}^{(\\mathrm{Pa})} - d_{i}^{(\\mathrm{Sh})}) = (-16) + (-14) + (-14) + (-14) + (-14) = -72$$\n$$\\widehat{\\Delta}_{\\mathrm{Shannon}} - \\widehat{\\Delta}_{\\mathrm{Pauling}} = \\frac{1}{5} (-72) = -14.4$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to four significant figures. This gives $-14.40$. The negative sign indicates that the Shannon scale offset, $\\widehat{\\Delta}_{\\mathrm{Shannon}}$, is more negative than the Pauling scale offset, $\\widehat{\\Delta}_{\\mathrm{Pauling}}$. This implies that, on average, the sum of Shannon radii overestimates the measured interionic distance by a greater amount than the sum of Pauling radii.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{-14.40} $$", "id": "2950039"}]}
