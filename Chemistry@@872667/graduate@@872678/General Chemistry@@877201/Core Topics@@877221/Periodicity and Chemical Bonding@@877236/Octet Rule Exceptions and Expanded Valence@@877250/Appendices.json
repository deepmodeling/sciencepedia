An alternative resonance structure can be drawn where one Fluorine forms a double bond with Boron to complete Boron's octet. This, however, would result in a formal charge of $-1$ on Boron and $+1$ on the double-bonded Fluorine. Placing a positive formal charge on the most electronegative element in the periodic table (Fluorine) is highly unfavorable. Therefore, the dominant, lowest-energy structure is the one with the incomplete octet on Boron.\n**Conclusion:** $\\mathrm{BF_3}$ is an exception to the octet rule.\n\n**4.

The Oxygen atom (Group $16$) provides $6$ valence electrons.\nTotal valence electrons = $5 + 6 = 11$.\nAny species with an odd number of total valence electrons is a radical and cannot possibly satisfy the octet rule for all of its atoms.\nThe most plausible Lewis structure is $\\cdot\\ddot{N}=\\ddot{O}$, which minimizes formal charges (FC(N) = $0$, FC(O) = $0$). In this structure, Nitrogen has a total of $7$ electrons (one unpaired electron, one lone pair, and a double bond), while Oxygen has a full octet. The alternative resonance form, $\\ddot{N}=\\ddot{O}\\cdot$, places a negative formal charge on Nitrogen and a positive formal charge on the more electronegative Oxygen, making it less stable.\n**Conclusion:** $\\mathrm{NO}$ is an odd-electron radical and an exception to the octet rule.\n\n**5.

The total valence electron count is $19$ due to radical stabilization. The dominant Lewis description has two equivalent $\\mathrm{N{-}O}$ bonds with the unpaired electron delocalized, and the geometry at nitrogen is trigonal planar with a bond angle of $120^\\circ$.", "solution": "The problem requires a rigorous application of fundamental chemical principles to determine the electronic and geometric structure of the nitrogen dioxide molecule, $\\mathrm{NO_2}$. We will proceed with a systematic, step-by-step derivation before evaluating the provided options.\n\nFirst, we must determine the total number of valence electrons. The nitrogen atom (Group $15$) contributes $5$ valence electrons. Each oxygen atom (Group $16$) contributes $6$ valence electrons. For the neutral molecule $\\mathrm{NO_2}$, the total count is:\n$$ \\text{Valence electrons} = (\\text{e}^- \\text{ from N}) + 2 \\times (\\text{e}^- \\text{ from O}) = 5 + 2 \\times 6 = 17 $$\nThe total is $17$ valence electrons. This is an odd number, which is consistent with the problem's statement that $\\mathrm{NO_2}$ is an odd-electron species, also known as a radical. A molecule with an odd number of electrons cannot satisfy the octet rule for all of its atoms.\n\nSecond, we construct the most plausible Lewis structure. Nitrogen is less electronegative than oxygen and is therefore the central atom. The skeletal structure is $\\mathrm{O–N–O}$. After forming two single bonds (using $4$ electrons), $17 - 4 = 13$ electrons remain to be distributed. To satisfy the octets of the terminal oxygen atoms as much as possible, we would typically place $6$ electrons on each as lone pairs. This would use $12$ electrons, leaving $1$ electron to be placed on the central nitrogen atom. At this stage, the nitrogen atom only has $2+2+1=5$ electrons in its valence shell, which is an insufficient octet.\n\nTo improve this structure, we form a multiple bond by moving a lone pair from one of the oxygen atoms to form a bond with nitrogen. This gives rise to two equivalent resonance structures:\n\nStructure I:  $\\ddot{\\mathrm{O}}=\\dot{\\mathrm{N}}-\\ddot{\\mathrm{O}}:^-$\nStructure II: $:^-\\ddot{\\mathrm{O}}-\\dot{\\mathrm{N}}=\\ddot{\\mathrm{O}}$\n\nLet us analyze the formal charges (FC) for one of these structures, for example, Structure I:\n$$ \\text{FC} = (\\text{Valence e}^-) - (\\text{Non-bonding e}^-) - \\frac{1}{2}(\\text{Bonding e}^-) $$\n- For the doubly bonded O: $\\text{FC} = 6 - 4 - \\frac{1}{2}(4) = 0$.\n- For the nitrogen atom: $\\text{FC} = 5 - 1 - \\frac{1}{2}(6) = +1$.\n- For the singly bonded O: $\\text{FC} = 6 - 6 - \\frac{1}{2}(2) = -1$.\n\nThese resonance structures place the unpaired electron on the nitrogen atom, which has an incomplete octet of $7$ electrons ($4$ in the double bond, $2$ in the single bond, and $1$ unpaired). The formal charges are $+1$ on nitrogen and $-1$ on the singly bonded oxygen. This charge separation is unavoidable in a good Lewis structure for $\\mathrm{NO_2}$. The true structure is a resonance hybrid of these two forms, meaning the two $\\mathrm{N-O}$ bonds are identical and have a bond order intermediate between a single and a double bond, specifically $(2+1)/2 = 1.5$.\n\nThird, we predict the molecular geometry using the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) model. The central nitrogen atom has three electron domains: a domain for the N-O single bond, a domain for the N-O double bond (in a given resonance structure), and a domain for the single unpaired electron. For the purposes of determining overall geometry, we treat single, double, and triple bonds as single domains. Thus, we have two bonding domains and one non-bonding domain (the unpaired electron). The three domains will arrange themselves in a trigonal planar electron geometry to minimize repulsion. The molecular geometry, which describes the positions of the atoms, is therefore bent.\n\nThe ideal bond angle in a trigonal planar arrangement is $120^\\circ$. However, the repulsive forces exerted by the different domains are not equal. The repulsion order is generally given as: lone pair > multiple bond > single bond. An unpaired electron is a smaller domain of negative charge than a lone pair (one electron versus two), and its repulsive effect is considered to be weaker than that of a bonding pair. Consequently, the repulsion between the two N–O bonding domains is the dominant interaction, which pushes them apart to an angle larger than the ideal $120^\\circ$. The $\\mathrm{O–N–O}$ bond angle is therefore predicted to be greater than $120^\\circ$.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option against this derivation.\n\nA. The total valence electron count is $17$. The dominant Lewis description has nitrogen central with one $\\mathrm{N{=}O}$ and one $\\mathrm{N{-}O}$ bond plus one unpaired electron on nitrogen; the two resonance forms interconvert by shifting the $\\mathrm{N{=}O}$ to the other oxygen, giving an average $\\mathrm{N{-}O}$ bond order of approximately $1.5$. Formal charges are minimized to $+1$ on nitrogen and $-1$ on the singly bonded oxygen in each resonance contributor. VSEPR treats two bonding regions and one unpaired-electron domain at nitrogen, predicting a bent geometry with an O–N–O angle greater than $120^\\circ$ but less than $180^\\circ$ (experimentally near $134^\\circ$).\n- This option correctly states the valence electron count is $17$.\n- It provides a correct description of the resonance structures, the location of the unpaired electron, the average bond order, and the formal charges.\n- It correctly applies VSEPR theory to an odd-electron system, predicting a bent geometry with a bond angle greater than $120^\\circ$.\nAll parts of this statement are correct and consistent with our analysis.\n**Verdict: Correct**\n\nB. The total valence electron count is $18$. The dominant Lewis description has two equivalent $\\mathrm{N{=}O}$ double bonds, satisfying the octet on nitrogen with no unpaired electrons, and a trigonal planar electron-domain arrangement at nitrogen giving a bond angle of $120^\\circ$.\n- The valence electron count of $18$ is incorrect. This statement describes the nitrite ion, $\\mathrm{NO_2^-}$, not the neutral $\\mathrm{NO_2}$ molecule.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nC. The total valence electron count is $17$. The unpaired electron is best placed on an oxygen to avoid charge separation, and the central nitrogen adopts a linear arrangement with two equivalent $\\mathrm{N{-}O}$ bonds and an O–N–O angle of $180^\\circ$.\n- The valence electron count of $17$ is correct. However, placing the odd electron on the highly electronegative oxygen atom is less favorable than placing it on the central nitrogen atom. Furthermore, a linear geometry implies only two electron domains around nitrogen, which contradicts the presence of two bonding partners and an unpaired electron. The predicted geometry is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nD. The total valence electron count is $17$. The dominant Lewis description has two $\\mathrm{N{-}O}$ single bonds and a lone pair on nitrogen completing its octet, producing a strongly bent geometry with a bond angle near $104.5^\\circ$ (similar to water), and all atoms with formal charge $0$.\n- A structure with two single bonds and a lone pair on nitrogen requires $18$ valence electrons, not $17$. The statement that nitrogen's octet is complete is impossible for a $17$-electron species. The prediction of a bond angle near $104.5^\\circ$ corresponds to a tetrahedral electron geometry (four domains), which is incorrect. The claim of zero formal charge on all atoms is also false for any reasonable structure of $\\mathrm{NO_2}$ or $\\mathrm{NO_2^-}$.\n**Verdict: Incorrect**\n\nE. The total valence electron count is $19$ due to radical stabilization. The dominant Lewis description has two equivalent $\\mathrm{N{-}O}$ bonds with the unpaired electron delocalized, and the geometry at nitrogen is trigonal planar with a bond angle of $120^\\circ$.\n- The valence electron count of $19$ is incorrect. The justification \"due to radical stabilization\" is nonsensical chemical reasoning for changing the electron count.

All provided information is consistent with established principles of general chemistry.\n\nHere, we will proceed with a systematic analysis of the two proposed sets of Lewis structures for the sulfate ion, $\\mathrm{SO_4^{2-}}$, and evaluate them against the given experimental data.\n\nFirst, let us determine the total number of valence electrons for the sulfate ion. Sulfur (S) is in Group $16$ and has $V_S = 6$ valence electrons. Oxygen (O) is also in Group $16$ and has $V_O = 6$ valence electrons. The ion has a charge of $2-$.

This uses $4 \\times 2 = 8$ bonding electrons. The remaining $32 - 8 = 24$ electrons are distributed as lone pairs on the four oxygen atoms, with each oxygen receiving $6$ nonbonding electrons (3 lone pairs) to complete its octet.\n\nIn this structure:\n- Each oxygen atom has $2$ bonding electrons and $6$ nonbonding electrons, satisfying the octet rule ($2+6=8$).\n- The sulfur atom shares $4$ pairs of electrons, for a total of $8$ valence electrons, also satisfying the octet rule.\n\nLet us calculate the formal charges using the formula $q_{\\text{formal}} = V - (N + B/2)$.\n- For sulfur: $q_S = 6 - (0 + 8/2) = +2$.\n- For each oxygen: $q_O = 6 - (6 + 2/2) = -1$.\nThe sum of formal charges is $(+2) + 4(-1) = -2$, which correctly matches the ion's charge.\n\n*Evaluation against experimental data:*\n1.  **Bond Equivalence**: This model features a single, highly symmetric structure where all four S-O bonds are identical single bonds. This is consistent with the experimental finding that all S-O distances are equal.\n2.  **Bond Length**: The model predicts a bond order of $1$ for all S-O bonds. This would imply a bond length typical of an S-O single bond, which is given as approximately $1.56\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$. The experimental bond length is $1.47\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$, which is significantly shorter. This model fails to account for the observed bond length.\n3.  **Charge Distribution**: This model places a large formal charge of $+2$ on sulfur and $-1$ on each oxygen. While the negative charge is on the more electronegative oxygen atoms, this large charge separation is generally considered unfavorable.\n\n**Analysis of Set $\\mathcal{F}$ (Formal-Charge-Minimized Expanded Valence on Sulfur)**\n\nThis model proposes a set of resonance structures where sulfur has an expanded valence. Each canonical structure consists of two S=O double bonds and two S-O single bonds. The number of such distinct structures is the number of ways to choose two oxygen atoms out of four to form double bonds, which is:\n$$ \\binom{4}{2} = \\frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6 $$\n\nIn any one of these $6$ canonical structures:\n- The two single-bonded oxygen atoms ($\\mathrm{O_s}$) each have $6$ nonbonding electrons and a complete octet.\n- The two double-bonded oxygen atoms ($\\mathrm{O_d}$) each have $4$ nonbonding electrons and a complete octet.\n- The sulfur atom participates in two single bonds and two double bonds, for a total of $2(2) + 2(4) = 12$ shared electrons, an expanded valence shell.\n\nLet us calculate the formal charges for one such structure:\n- For sulfur: $q_S = 6 - (0 + 12/2) = 0$.\n- For a double-bonded oxygen ($\\mathrm{O_d}$): $q_{O_d} = 6 - (4 + 4/2) = 0$.\n- For a single-bonded oxygen ($\\mathrm{O_s}$): $q_{O_s} = 6 - (6 + 2/2) = -1$.\nThe sum of formal charges is $0 + 2(0) + 2(-1) = -2$, matching the ion's charge. These formal charges are minimized compared to Set $\\mathcal{O}$.\n\n*Evaluation against experimental data:*\nThe true structure is considered a resonance hybrid of these $6$ canonical forms.\n1.  **Bond Equivalence**: Because the six resonance structures distribute the double bonds symmetrically across all four S-O positions, the resonance hybrid will have four identical S-O bonds. This is consistent with experiment.\n2.  **Bond Order and Length**: Let's calculate the average bond order for any S-O bond. Consider a specific S-O bond. Out of the $6$ resonance structures, it will be a double bond in $3$ of them and a single bond in the other $3$. The average bond order is therefore:\n    $$ \\text{Bond Order} = \\frac{(3 \\times \\text{order 2}) + (3 \\times \\text{order 1})}{6} = \\frac{3 \\times 2 + 3 \\times 1}{6} = \\frac{9}{6} = 1.5 $$\n    A bond order of $1.5$ is intermediate between a single bond (order $1$) and a double bond (order $2$). This correctly predicts a bond length intermediate between the typical single bond length ($1.56\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$) and double bond length ($1.42\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$). The experimental value of $1.47\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$ fits this prediction excellently.\n3.  **Vibrational Frequency**: A bond order of $1.5$ implies a stronger bond than a single bond. Stronger bonds have higher force constants and thus higher stretching frequencies. The observation of a high frequency ($1100\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$) is consistent with a bond order significantly greater than $1$.\n4.  **Charge Distribution**: In the resonance hybrid, the average formal charge on sulfur is $0$. The total $-2$ charge is distributed over the four oxygen atoms, so the average formal charge on each oxygen is $-2/4 = -0.5$. This model places the negative charge entirely on the more electronegative oxygen atoms, consistent with experimental electron density analysis.\n\n**Conclusion**: Set $\\mathcal{F}$ provides a superior description that is consistent with all pieces of experimental evidence: bond equivalence (via resonance), intermediate bond length and high stretching frequency (via bond order of $1.5$), and charge distribution.\n\nNow, we evaluate the given options.\n\n**A. Choose set $\\mathcal{O}$: keeping sulfur at an octet forces all four $\\mathrm{S}-\\mathrm{O}$ bonds to be single and therefore identical; the absence of multiple bonds ensures equivalence and accounts for the observed short $\\mathrm{S}-\\mathrm{O}$ distance by generic “ionic contraction.”**\nThis option correctly notes that Set $\\mathcal{O}$ predicts bond equivalence. However, its explanation for the short bond length, \"ionic contraction,\" is a qualitative, ad hoc justification for a significant quantitative discrepancy. The prediction from bond order is a bond length of $\\sim 1.56\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$, and the model provides no quantitative way to get to $1.47\\,\\mathrm{\\AA}$. Set $\\mathcal{F}$ provides a much more direct and compelling explanation. Thus, this justification is not the most defensible.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Choose set $\\mathcal{F}$: resonance among the six canonical structures distributes the two $\\mathrm{S}=\\mathrm{O}$ double bonds over all four positions so that, for any given $\\mathrm{S}-\\mathrm{O}$ link, the average bond order is $1.5$, consistent with identical, intermediate $\\mathrm{S}-\\mathrm{O}$ bond lengths and high stretching frequency; the formal charges place most negative charge on oxygen, in line with electronegativity and experiment.**\nThis option accurately summarizes the successful application of the resonance model in Set $\\mathcal{F}$. It correctly calculates the bond order as $1.5$ and links this to the intermediate bond length and high frequency. It also correctly describes the resulting favorable charge distribution. Every part of this statement is sound and directly follows from the principles laid out in the problem. This is a complete and defensible justification.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Neither set is appropriate: genuine inequivalence (two short and two long $\\mathrm{S}-\\mathrm{O}$ bonds) exists, but rapid interconversion (“pseudorotation”) in solution and crystallographic disorder in the solid average the distances to equality; the Lewis pictures are irrelevant here.**\nThis option fundamentally misinterprets the concept of resonance. Resonance contributors are not real, interconverting structures; they are components of a single, static description of the electronic structure. The equivalence of the bonds in $\\mathrm{SO_4^{2-}}$ arises from electronic delocalization, not a dynamic physical process averaging distinct bond lengths. Therefore, the premise of this option is incorrect.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Choose set $\\mathcal{F}$, but only if substantial sulfur $3d$-orbital participation is invoked to make all four $\\mathrm{S}-\\mathrm{O}$ bonds true partial double bonds; without $3d$ involvement, equivalence cannot be achieved by resonance alone.**\nThis option contains a false assertion. As demonstrated in the analysis of Set $\\mathcal{F}$ and option B, bond equivalence *is* achieved via the standard concept of resonance, by averaging the six canonical forms, without any need to invoke specific atomic orbitals like sulfur $3d$ orbitals. The theory of resonance itself guarantees an averaged, symmetric hybrid structure. Furthermore, modern computational chemistry indicates that the involvement of $d$-orbitals in the bonding of main-group elements is minimal and not the primary explanation for \"hypervalency\". The justification provided is therefore flawed.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2948506"}]}
