It requests the calculation of formal charges for the atoms in the ammonium ion, $\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$, and a proof based on first principles of electron bookkeeping. All necessary information is provided, and the concepts are fundamental to general chemistry. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe formal charge, $FC$, on an atom in a Lewis structure is defined by the relation:\n$$FC = V - \\left(N + \\frac{B}{2}\\right)$$\nwhere $V$ is the number of valence electrons of the isolated neutral atom, $N$ is the number of nonbonding electrons (lone pair electrons) assigned to that atom in the Lewis structure, and $B$ is the number of bonding electrons (shared electrons) in covalent bonds to that atom.\n\nFirst, we must establish the Lewis structure of the ammonium ion, $\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$. The total number of valence electrons for the structure is the sum of the valence electrons from each atom, adjusted for the overall charge of the ion. Nitrogen ($\\mathrm{N}$) is in Group $15$, so it has $V_N = 5$ valence electrons. Hydrogen ($\\mathrm{H}$) is in Group $1$, so it has $V_H = 1$ valence electron. For an ion with a charge of $+1$, one electron is removed from the total count.\n$$ \\text{Total valence electrons} = V_N + 4 \\times V_H - 1 = 5 + 4(1) - 1 = 8 $$\nThe structure consists of a central nitrogen atom single-bonded to four hydrogen atoms. This arrangement requires $4$ single bonds, using $4 \\times 2 = 8$ electrons. This accounts for all available valence electrons. The nitrogen atom is surrounded by $8$ electrons (octet rule satisfied), and each hydrogen atom is surrounded by $2$ electrons (duet rule satisfied). This structure has no nonbonding electrons on the nitrogen atom, which is consistent with the problem statement.\n\nWe can now identify the triplet $(V, N, B)$ for each atom type.\n\nFor the Nitrogen atom ($\\mathrm{N}$):\n- $V_N$: The number of valence electrons for a neutral nitrogen atom is $5$.\n- $N_N$: In the Lewis structure of $\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$, there are no lone pairs on the nitrogen atom, so the number of nonbonding electrons is $0$.\n- $B_N$: The nitrogen atom forms four single covalent bonds. Each bond contains $2$ electrons, so the total number of bonding electrons adjacent to the nitrogen atom is $4 \\times 2 = 8$.\nThus, the triplet for nitrogen is $(V_N, N_N, B_N) = (5, 0, 8)$.\n\nUsing this triplet, the formal charge on the nitrogen atom, $FC_N$, is:\n$$ FC_N = V_N - \\left(N_N + \\frac{B_N}{2}\\right) = 5 - \\left(0 + \\frac{8}{2}\\right) = 5 - 4 = +1 $$\n\nFor a generic Hydrogen atom ($\\mathrm{H}$):\n- $V_H$: The number of valence electrons for a neutral hydrogen atom is $1$.\n- $N_H$: In the Lewis structure, each hydrogen atom has no lone pairs, so the number of nonbonding electrons is $0$.\n- $B_H$: Each hydrogen atom forms one single covalent bond with the nitrogen atom. This bond contains $2$ electrons, so the number of bonding electrons adjacent to a hydrogen atom is $2$.\nThus, the triplet for a hydrogen atom is $(V_H, N_H, B_H) = (1, 0, 2)$.\n\nThe formal charge on each hydrogen atom, $FC_H$, is:\n$$ FC_H = V_H - \\left(N_H + \\frac{B_H}{2}\\right) = 1 - \\left(0 + \\frac{2}{2}\\right) = 1 - 1 = 0 $$\n\nFinally, we must prove from first principles that the sum of the formal charges on all atoms in an ion is equal to the overall charge of the ion, $Q$. Let the ion consist of atoms indexed by $i$. The sum of the formal charges is:\n$$ \\sum_{i} FC_i = \\sum_{i} \\left[ V_i - \\left(N_i + \\frac{B_i}{2}\\right) \\right] $$\nRearranging the summation:\n$$ \\sum_{i} FC_i = \\sum_{i} V_i - \\sum_{i} N_i - \\sum_{i} \\frac{B_i}{2} $$\nThe term $\\sum_i V_i$ is the total number of valence electrons if all atoms were neutral and isolated.\nThe term $\\sum_i N_i$ is the total number of nonbonding electrons in the structure.\nThe term $\\sum_i B_i$ counts every bonding electron twice, once for each of the two atoms participating in the bond. Therefore, $\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_i B_i$ is the total number of bonding electrons in the structure.\nThe expression $\\left( \\sum_i N_i + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_i B_i \\right)$ represents the total number of valence electrons accounted for in the Lewis structure, let us call this $E_{total}$.\nSo, the sum of formal charges is the difference between the sum of valence electrons of the neutral atoms and the total number of electrons in the Lewis structure:\n$$ \\sum_{i} FC_i = \\left(\\sum_{i} V_i\\right) - E_{total} $$\nThe total number of electrons in the Lewis structure, $E_{total}$, is by definition equal to the sum of the valence electrons of the neutral atoms minus the overall charge of the ion, $Q$.\n$$ E_{total} = \\left(\\sum_{i} V_i\\right) - Q $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for the sum of formal charges:\n$$ \\sum_{i} FC_i = \\left(\\sum_{i} V_i\\right) - \\left[ \\left(\\sum_{i} V_i\\right) - Q \\right] $$\n$$ \\sum_{i} FC_i = \\left(\\sum_{i} V_i\\right) - \\left(\\sum_{i} V_i\\right) + Q $$\n$$ \\sum_{i} FC_i = Q $$\nThis completes the proof. For the ammonium ion, $\\mathrm{NH_4^+}$, the overall charge is $Q=+1$. The sum of the calculated formal charges is:\n$$ \\sum FC = FC_N + 4 \\times FC_H = (+1) + 4 \\times (0) = +1 $$\nThe result is consistent with the proven general principle.

It is critical to recognize from the outset that these two notations describe the exact same physical connectivity: a central carbon atom bonded to a terminal oxygen and a terminal nitrogen. The molecule is not different if its formula is written from left-to-right or right-to-left. However, we shall proceed by analyzing the resonance structures for this single connectivity, as framed by the problem.\n\nLet us construct the possible octet-satisfying Lewis structures for the $\\mathrm{OCN^{-}}$ ion, which has the connectivity $\\mathrm{O-C-N}$.\n\n**Structure I:** A single bond between O and C, a triple bond between C and N.\n$$[:\\ddot{O}-C\\equiv N:]^{-}$$\nThis structure, as written, is incomplete.

It is therefore a very minor contributor to the overall resonance hybrid.\n- Structures A and B both feature minimal formal charges (magnitudes of $0$ and $1$). They are the major contributors.\n- Between A and B, Structure A is the most dominant contributor because it places the negative formal charge on oxygen, the most electronegative atom in the ion ($\\chi(\\mathrm{O}) > \\chi(\\mathrm{N})$). Structure B, which places the charge on nitrogen, is a significant but secondary contributor.\n\nThe problem notation \"isocyanate\" for the $\\mathrm{N-C-O}$ connectivity is merely a reversal of the writing direction. The set of atoms and their bonding sequence are identical. Thus, the analysis yields the same set of resonance structures, simply mirrored.\nFor $\\mathrm{N-C-O}$:\n- $[:\\ddot{N}\\equiv C-\\ddot{O}:]^{-}$ corresponds to Structure A, with $FC(\\mathrm{N})=0, FC(\\mathrm{C})=0, FC(\\mathrm{O})=-1$.\n- $[:\\ddot{N}=C=\\ddot{O}:]^{-}$ corresponds to Structure B, with $FC(\\mathrm{N})=-1, FC(\\mathrm{C})=0, FC(\\mathrm{O})=0$.\n- $[:\\ddot{\\ddot{N}}-C\\equiv O:]^{-}$ corresponds to Structure C, with $FC(\\mathrm{N})=-2, FC(\\mathrm{C})=0, FC(\\mathrm{O})=+1$.\n\nThe conclusions are identical: the most dominant Lewis contributor is the one that places the $-1$ formal charge on the oxygen atom. The distinction between \"cyanate connectivity\" and \"isocyanate connectivity\", as defined in the problem, is artificial. There is only one central-carbon connectivity for these three atoms. The preferred electronic arrangement within this single connectivity is described by the resonance hybrid, which is dominated by the structure placing the negative charge on oxygen.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option.\n\nA. The cyanate connectivity $\\mathrm{O{-}C\\equiv N}$ is preferred because its dominant Lewis contributor places the $-1$ charge on $\\mathrm{O}$ and $0$ on $\\mathrm{C}$ and $\\mathrm{N}$, whereas the isocyanate connectivity necessarily places the $-1$ charge on $\\mathrm{N}$.\n**Incorrect**. The first part is correct: the dominant contributor for the $\\mathrm{O-C-N}$ arrangement places the $-1$ charge on O. However, the second part is false. The \"isocyanate\" connectivity ($\\mathrm{N-C-O}$) also has a dominant contributor that places the $-1$ charge on O ($[:\\ddot{N}\\equiv C-\\ddot{O}:]^{-}$). It does not \"necessarily\" place the charge on N.\n\nB. The isocyanate connectivity $\\mathrm{N\\equiv C{-}O}$ is preferred because its dominant Lewis contributor places the $-1$ charge on $\\mathrm{N}$, which minimizes charge separation relative to cyanate.\n**Incorrect**. This statement contains multiple errors. The dominant contributor for the N-C-O connectivity places the charge on O, not N. The claim that this minimizes charge separation \"relative to cyanate\" is meaningless, as both \"connectivities\" are the same and have identical sets of formal charge distributions among their resonance structures.\n\nC. Both $\\mathrm{O{-}C\\equiv N}$ and $\\mathrm{N\\equiv C{-}O}$ describe the same central-carbon connectivity and admit dominant Lewis contributors with $-1$ on $\\mathrm{O}$ and $0$ on $\\mathrm{C}$ and $\\mathrm{N}$; neither orientation is intrinsically preferred. What is preferred is placement of negative charge on $\\mathrm{O}$ across the resonance set.\n**Correct**. This statement correctly identifies the central logical point: $\\mathrm{O-C-N}$ and $\\mathrm{N-C-O}$ represent the same connectivity. It correctly identifies the dominant Lewis contributor for this connectivity as the one with a $-1$ formal charge on the oxygen atom. It correctly states that this charge placement is preferred due to oxygen's high electronegativity. This option is entirely consistent with our derivation from first principles.\n\nD. A connectivity with central nitrogen, $\\mathrm{C\\equiv N{-}O}$, is preferred because placing the least electronegative atom in the center minimizes formal-charge separation and best aligns charge with electronegativity.\n**Incorrect**. The problem explicitly restricts the analysis to structures with a central carbon atom. This option proposes a different connectivity ($\\mathrm{C-N-O}$) and is therefore not a valid answer to the question posed. Furthermore, a formal charge analysis of the $\\mathrm{C-N-O}$ connectivity shows it leads to *greater* formal charge separation (e.g., a structure with charges of $FC(\\mathrm{C})=-1, FC(\\mathrm{N})=+1, FC(\\mathrm{O})=-1$). The general rule that placing the least electronegative atom in the center minimizes formal charges is true for the $\\mathrm{OCN^{-}}$ ion, favoring the central carbon structure over this central nitrogen one.

The formula for calculating formal charge is:\n$$FC = V - N - \\frac{B}{2}$$\nwhere $V$ is the number of valence electrons of the neutral atom in its ground state, $N$ is the number of non-bonding valence electrons on the atom in the Lewis structure, and $B$ is the total number of electrons shared in covalent bonds with the atom.\n\nWe are given the Lewis structure of the cyanide anion, $CN^{-}$, as having a triple bond between carbon and nitrogen, with one lone pair on each atom. This structure is represented as $[:C\\equiv N:]^{-}$. Both atoms satisfy the octet rule, each being associated with $8$ valence electrons (one lone pair, $2$ electrons, plus a triple bond, $6$ electrons).\n\nFirst, we determine the formal charge on the carbon atom, $FC_C$.\nThe carbon atom is in Group $14$ of the periodic table, so its count of valence electrons as a neutral atom is $V_C = 4$.\nIn the given structure, the carbon atom has one lone pair, which corresponds to $N_C = 2$ non-bonding electrons.\nThe carbon atom participates in a triple bond, sharing $6$ electrons. Thus, $B_C = 6$.\nApplying the formal charge formula for carbon:\n$$FC_C = V_C - N_C - \\frac{B_C}{2} = 4 - 2 - \\frac{6}{2} = 4 - 2 - 3 = -1$$\nThe formal charge on the carbon atom is $-1$.\n\nNext, we determine the formal charge on the nitrogen atom, $FC_N$.\nThe nitrogen atom is in Group $15$ of the periodic table, so its count of valence electrons as a neutral atom is $V_N = 5$.\nIn the given structure, the nitrogen atom has one lone pair, which corresponds to $N_N = 2$ non-bonding electrons.\nThe nitrogen atom also participates in the triple bond, sharing $6$ electrons. Thus, $B_N = 6$.\nApplying the formal charge formula for nitrogen:\n$$FC_N = V_N - N_N - \\frac{B_N}{2} = 5 - 2 - \\frac{6}{2} = 5 - 2 - 3 = 0$$\nThe formal charge on the nitrogen atom is $0$.\n\nTo verify the calculations, the sum of the formal charges on all atoms in an ion must equal the overall charge of the ion. The overall charge of the cyanide anion is given as $-1$.\nThe sum of the calculated formal charges is:\n$$\\sum FC = FC_C + FC_N = (-1) + (0) = -1$$\nThe sum of the formal charges equals the overall charge of the ion, which validates the assignment.\n\nFinally, we must explain why the carbon atom, not the more electronegative nitrogen atom, is the primary nucleophilic site. Nucleophilicity is the kinetic propensity of a species to donate an electron pair. The region of a molecule that is most nucleophilic is typically the site of highest electron density and/or highest energy occupied molecular orbital (HOMO).\n\nThere is an apparent conflict between two principles:\n$1$. Electronegativity: Nitrogen is more electronegative than carbon. On the Pauling scale, the electronegativity of nitrogen is approximately $3.04$ while that of carbon is approximately $2.55$. Electronegativity is the tendency of an atom to attract a bonding pair of electrons. Naively, this suggests that any excess negative charge density should reside preferentially on the nitrogen atom.\n$2$. Formal Charge: Our calculation places a formal charge of $-1$ on carbon and $0$ on nitrogen. Formal charge, while a bookkeeping device, is a powerful indicator of electron distribution in the most plausible Lewis structure. A negative formal charge indicates a local excess of electron density compared to the neutral atom.\n\nThe resolution lies in understanding that formal charge often provides a better prediction of reactivity than electronegativity differences alone, especially in charged species. The Lewis structure $[:C\\equiv N:]^{-}$ with $FC_C = -1$ and $FC_N = 0$ is the dominant resonance contributor for the cyanide anion. This distribution of formal charge indicates that the excess electron density associated with the anion's overall $-1$ charge is more localized on the carbon atom.\n\nFrom a qualitative molecular orbital perspective, the lone pair of electrons on the carbon atom occupies the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the $CN^{-}$ ion. Because carbon is less electronegative than nitrogen, its atomic orbitals are higher in energy. Consequently, the carbon-based $sp$ hybrid orbital containing the lone pair is higher in energy than the nitrogen-based $sp$ lone pair orbital. Electrons in a higher-energy orbital are less tightly held and thus more available for donation to an electrophile. This makes the carbon atom's lone pair more basic and more nucleophilic.\n\nTherefore, the combination of a localized negative formal charge and the higher energy of the carbon-centered lone pair orbital makes the carbon atom in the cyanide anion a stronger nucleophile than the nitrogen atom, despite nitrogen's greater electronegativity. The formal charge on carbon correctly predicts the location of the molecule's highest nucleophilic reactivity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-1}$$", "id": "2938976"}]}
