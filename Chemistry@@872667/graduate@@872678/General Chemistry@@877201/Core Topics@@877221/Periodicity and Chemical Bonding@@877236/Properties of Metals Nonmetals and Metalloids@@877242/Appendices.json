The photon energy is related to its wavelength $\\lambda$ by the Planck-Einstein relation, $E_{photon} = h\\nu = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda}$, where $h$ is Planck's constant and $c$ is the speed of light. Thus, the equation is:\n$$K_{max} = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda} - \\phi$$\nThe problem defines the threshold of photoemission as the condition where $K_{max} = 0$. The corresponding wavelength is the threshold wavelength, $\\lambda_{th}$. At this threshold:\n$$0 = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda_{th}} - \\phi$$\nThis directly gives the work function in terms of the threshold wavelength:\n$$\\phi = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda_{th}}$$\nThe problem provides two distinct threshold wavelengths for the two crystallographic facets, $\\lambda_{(111)}$ and $\\lambda_{(100)}$. The work functions for these respective facets are therefore:\n$$\\phi_{(111)} = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda_{(111)}}$$\n$$\\phi_{(100)} = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda_{(100)}}$$\nThe required quantity is the difference between these two work functions, $\\Delta\\phi = \\phi_{(111)} - \\phi_{(100)}$.\n$$\\Delta\\phi = \\frac{hc}{\\lambda_{(111)}} - \\frac{hc}{\\lambda_{(100)}} = hc \\left( \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{(111)}} - \\frac{1}{\\lambda_{(100)}} \\right)$$\nThe result must be expressed in electronvolts (eV).

This result is physically consistent with established models of metallic surfaces. The work function, $\\phi = E_{vac} - E_F$, depends on the surface through the vacuum level energy, $E_{vac}$. The position of $E_{vac}$ is determined by the surface dipole layer that forms due to the redistribution of electron charge at the crystal-vacuum interface.\nFor an FCC lattice, the $\\{111\\}$ plane is the most densely packed surface, while the $\\{100\\}$ plane is less dense. According to the Smoluchowski effect, electron charge redistribution is more significant on atomically rougher, more open surfaces. Electrons tend to \"smooth out\" the corrugated potential of the ion cores by flowing from the protruding atomic sites into the troughs between them. This lateral charge transfer creates a dipole moment that points out of the surface, which effectively *lowers* the surface potential barrier and hence the work function. This smoothing effect is more pronounced for more open surfaces.\nConsequently, the work function is expected to be highest for the smoothest, most densely packed surface. The order of packing density for FCC crystals is $\\{111\\}  \\{100\\}  \\{110\\}$. Therefore, the expected trend in work functions is $\\phi_{(111)}  \\phi_{(100)}  \\phi_{(110)}$.

The transport-integral framework allows for a clear explanation.\n\nFirst, consider the role of an energy-dependent relaxation time, $\\tau(\\epsilon)$, or more generally, an energy-dependent transport function $\\Sigma(\\epsilon)$. This is relevant for strongly correlated metals where electron-electron scattering can give $\\tau(\\epsilon) \\propto (\\epsilon - E_F)^{-2}$, and for metalloids where the density of states $g(\\epsilon)$ can vary rapidly near $E_F$. In such cases, we must retain higher-order terms in the Sommerfeld expansion for $\\sigma$.\n$$ \\sigma = e^2 \\mathcal{L}_0 \\approx e^2 \\left[ \\Sigma(\\mu) + \\frac{\\pi^2}{6}(k_B T)^2 \\Sigma''(\\mu) \\right] $$\nThe leading-order term for $k_e$ remains unchanged, $k_e \\approx \\frac{\\pi^2}{3} k_B^2 T \\Sigma(\\mu)$. The Lorenz number becomes:\n$$ L = \\frac{k_e}{\\sigma T} = \\frac{\\frac{\\pi^2}{3} k_B^2 T \\Sigma(\\mu)}{e^2 \\left[ \\Sigma(\\mu) + \\frac{\\pi^2}{6}(k_B T)^2 \\Sigma''(\\mu) \\right] T} = L_0 \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{\\pi^2}{6}(k_B T)^2 \\frac{\\Sigma''(\\mu)}{\\Sigma(\\mu)}} $$\n$$ L \\approx L_0 \\left( 1 - \\frac{\\pi^2}{6}(k_B T)^2 \\frac{\\Sigma''(\\mu)}{\\Sigma(\\mu)} \\right) $$\nThis shows that a strong energy dependence in $\\Sigma(\\epsilon)$, leading to a non-zero second derivative $\\Sigma''(\\mu)$ at the chemical potential, introduces a temperature-dependent correction to $L$ of order $T^2$. The Lorenz ratio is no longer constant and its magnitude deviates from $L_0$.\n\nSecond, consider multi-carrier transport, which is characteristic of metalloids (semimetals) with both electron and hole pockets at the Fermi level. The total electrical conductivity is the sum of contributions from each carrier type, $\\sigma_{\\text{tot}} = \\sigma_e + \\sigma_h$. However, the thermal conductivity is not simply the sum. In a temperature gradient, an internal electric field must be established to maintain the required zero-current condition. This E-field drives a \"bipolar\" flow: electrons and holes, being of opposite charge, flow in opposite directions, producing a circulating charge current that carries no net charge but transports a significant amount of heat. This constitutes an additional heat transport channel. Formally, using the transport integrals for a two-band system (e for electrons, h for holes):\n$$ \\sigma_{\\text{tot}} = e^2 (\\mathcal{L}_0^e + \\mathcal{L}_0^h) $$\n$$ k_{\\text{tot}} = \\frac{1}{T} \\left( (\\mathcal{L}_2^e + \\mathcal{L}_2^h) - \\frac{(\\mathcal{L}_1^e + \\mathcal{L}_1^h)^2}{\\mathcal{L}_0^e + \\mathcal{L}_0^h} \\right) $$\nThe term $\\mathcal{L}_1$ is related to the Seebeck effect. For electrons and holes, $\\mathcal{L}_1^e$ and $\\mathcal{L}_1^h$ typically have opposite signs. The presence of the $(\\mathcal{L}_1^e + \\mathcal{L}_1^h)^2$ term is the signature of the internal field. We can rewrite $k_{\\text{tot}}$ to isolate the bipolar contribution:\n$$ k_{\\text{tot}} = \\underbrace{\\frac{1}{T}\\left(\\mathcal{L}_2^e - \\frac{(\\mathcal{L}_1^e)^2}{\\mathcal{L}_0^e}\\right)}_{k_e} + \\underbrace{\\frac{1}{T}\\left(\\mathcal{L}_2^h - \\frac{(\\mathcal{L}_1^h)^2}{\\mathcal{L}_0^h}\\right)}_{k_h} + \\underbrace{\\frac{1}{T} \\frac{(\\mathcal{L}_1^e \\mathcal{L}_0^h - \\mathcal{L}_1^h \\mathcal{L}_0^e)^2}{\\mathcal{L}_0^e \\mathcal{L}_0^h (\\mathcal{L}_0^e+\\mathcal{L}_0^h)}}_{k_{\\text{bipolar}}} $$\nThe term $k_{\\text{bipolar}}$ is strictly non-negative and represents the extra heat current. Assuming each band individually would obey the Wiedemann-Franz law ($k_{e,h} \\approx L_0 \\sigma_{e,h} T$), the total Lorenz number is:\n$$ L = \\frac{k_e + k_h + k_{\\text{bipolar}}}{(\\sigma_e + \\sigma_h)T} \\approx L_0 + \\frac{k_{\\text{bipolar}}}{(\\sigma_e + \\sigma_h)T} $$\nThis bipolar term always leads to an enhancement of the Lorenz number, $L > L_0$. The magnitude of this enhancement depends on the relative contributions of electrons and holes to transport and is a hallmark of multi-carrier systems like metalloids.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.443 \\times 10^{-8}}$$", "id": "2952855"}]}
