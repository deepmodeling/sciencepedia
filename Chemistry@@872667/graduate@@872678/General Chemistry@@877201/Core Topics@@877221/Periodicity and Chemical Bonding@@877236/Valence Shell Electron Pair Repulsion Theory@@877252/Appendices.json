For an $AX_3E_1$ system, where A is the central atom, X are three identical substituents, and E is a non-bonding lone pair, VSEPR theory predicts a trigonal pyramidal geometry. This prediction holds true for trimethylamine, $\\mathrm{N(CH_3)_3}$, where the C-N-C bond angles are approximately 108°.\n\nHowever, a notable exception to this rule is its silicon analogue, trisilylamine, $\\mathrm{N(SiH_3)_3}$. Despite having the same $AX_3E_1$ electronic arrangement, experimental evidence shows that the $\\mathrm{N(SiH_3)_3}$ molecule is planar, with the nitrogen and three silicon atoms lying in the same plane.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental explanation for why trisilylamine, $\\mathrm{N(SiH_3)_3}$, is planar, while trimethylamine, $\\mathrm{N(CH_3)_3}$, is trigonal pyramidal?\n\nA. The SiH$_3$ groups are significantly larger than the CH$_3$ groups. The resulting steric hindrance is minimized by adopting a planar configuration, which allows for maximum separation between the bulky groups.\n\nB. The lone pair on the nitrogen atom delocalizes into the empty, low-energy 3d-orbitals of the adjacent silicon atoms. This $p\\pi-d\\pi$ interaction introduces partial double-bond character to the N-Si bonds, favoring a planar, $sp^2$-hybridized nitrogen center.\n\nC. Silicon is considerably less electronegative than carbon. This causes the N-Si bonds to be more polarized than the N-C bonds, which draws the nitrogen lone pair closer to the N nucleus, reducing its steric influence and allowing the molecule to become planar.\n\nD. The hybridization energy required to form an $sp^3$ orbital on nitrogen is significantly greater when it is bonded to silicon atoms compared to carbon atoms, making the $sp^2$ planar arrangement energetically more favorable.\n\nE. The hydrogen atoms on the silyl groups form weak hydrogen bonds with the nitrogen's lone pair, pulling the structure into a planar arrangement.", "solution": "1) By VSEPR, an $AX_{3}E_{1}$ center with a stereochemically active lone pair adopts a trigonal pyramidal geometry because lone pair–bond pair repulsions are greater than bond pair–bond pair repulsions. Trimethylamine, $\\mathrm{N(CH_{3})_{3}}$, follows this, so its nitrogen is effectively $sp^{3}$-hybridized with a pyramidal arrangement.\n\n2) For a nominal $AX_{3}E_{1}$ center to become planar, the lone pair must lose stereochemical activity. A fundamental way this occurs is through delocalization of the lone pair into an acceptor orbital on an adjacent atom, which imparts partial multiple-bond character to the central bond and stabilizes a trigonal planar, effectively $sp^{2}$-hybridized nitrogen. This is the same qualitative logic that explains amide planarity: donation of the nitrogen lone pair into a neighboring low-lying acceptor orbital reduces the lone pair’s localized electron density and enforces planarity.\n\n3) In trisilylamine, $\\mathrm{N(SiH_{3})_{3}}$, the accepted qualitative explanation provided among the given options is that the nitrogen lone pair delocalizes into empty acceptor orbitals on silicon, historically described as $p\\pi$–$d\\pi$ donation into empty $3d$ orbitals on Si. This donation imparts partial double-bond character to the N–Si bonds and stabilizes a planar, effectively $sp^{2}$ configuration at nitrogen. While modern orbital analyses emphasize that low-lying $\\sigma^{*}(\\mathrm{Si{-}R})$ and Rydberg-like acceptor orbitals are the principal acceptors rather than energetically suitable, compact $3d$ orbitals, among the choices provided, the only option that captures the essential and causative lone pair delocalization leading to partial multiple-bond character and planarity is option B.\n\n4) The alternative options are inconsistent with the observed behavior:\n- A (sterics): Increasing substituent size does not intrinsically demand planarity at nitrogen; steric bulk more often widens bond angles in a pyramidal geometry rather than enforcing full planarity at the central atom.\n- C (bond polarity): Greater N–Si bond polarity does not by itself eliminate the stereochemical activity of the lone pair or favor $sp^{2}$ planarity; polarization alone does not create the required delocalization pathway.\n- D (hybridization energy): There is no fundamental basis that the energy cost of $sp^{3}$ hybridization at nitrogen depends on whether it is bonded to Si versus C in a way that would invert the geometry preference to planar.\n- E (intramolecular hydrogen bonding): $\\mathrm{Si{-}H}$ bonds are not effective hydrogen-bond donors to the nitrogen lone pair in this context, and such interactions would not enforce global planarity.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate choice among those given is the one invoking lone pair delocalization that imparts partial double-bond character to N–Si and stabilizes a planar, effectively $sp^{2}$ nitrogen, namely B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2297976"}, {"introduction": "The principles of VSEPR, while often applied qualitatively, are rooted in the physics of electrostatic potential energy.
