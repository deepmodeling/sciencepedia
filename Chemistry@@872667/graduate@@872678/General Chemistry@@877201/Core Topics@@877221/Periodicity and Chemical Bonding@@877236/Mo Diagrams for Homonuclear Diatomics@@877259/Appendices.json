In LCAO theory, this term is primarily proportional to the overlap integral between the constituent atomic orbitals on different atoms that contribute to the two molecular orbitals. The model $V_{sp}(R) = \\kappa R \\exp(-\\alpha R)$ captures the essential physics of such overlap integrals: they are zero at $R=0$ and $R \\to \\infty$, and reach a maximum at some intermediate distance.\n\nThe magnitude of this coupling, together with the energy separation of the unperturbed levels, $E_{p}(R) - E_{s}(R)$, determines the extent of $s-p$ mixing and the magnitude of the level repulsion, $\\Delta E_{-}(R)$. Across the second-row diatomics from left to right (e.g., Li$_2$ to F$_2$), the atomic $2s-2p$ energy gap, $\\varepsilon_{p} - \\varepsilon_{s}$, increases significantly due to the increasing nuclear charge. According to perturbation theory and the exact result derived, a larger energy gap diminishes the effect of mixing. Consequently, $s-p$ mixing is most significant for the early diatomics in the period (like N$_2$ and lighter molecules) where the $2s-2p$ gap is small, and becomes progressively less important for O$_2$ and F$_2$ where the gap is large.

By explicitly constructing the properly (anti)symmetrized two-electron spatial functions from $\\varphi_{x}$ and $\\varphi_{y}$ and pairing them with the appropriate spin functions, derive the energy expressions of the lowest triplet and the lowest singlet in terms of $J_{\\pi_{x}\\pi_{y}}$ and $K_{\\pi_{x}\\pi_{y}}$.\n\nFinally, report a single closed-form analytic expression for the singlet–triplet gap\n$$\n\\Delta E \\equiv E\\big(\\text{lowest singlet from } \\pi_{g}^{\\ast\\,2}\\big) - E\\big(\\text{triplet ground state}\\big)\n$$\nin terms of $K_{\\pi_{x}\\pi_{y}}$ only. No numerical evaluation is required. Provide only this final expression as your answer. If you obtain a constant factor, it must be exact.", "solution": "First, we determine the allowed electronic terms arising from the $(\\pi_{g}^{\\ast})^{2}$ configuration. The two electrons occupy orbitals belonging to the $\\Pi_{g}$ irreducible representation of the $D_{\\infty h}$ point group. The symmetry of the resulting two-electron states is found by taking the direct product of the individual symmetries: $\\Pi_{g} \\otimes \\Pi_{g}$. The Pauli exclusion principle constrains the allowed combinations of spatial and spin wavefunctions. The total wavefunction $\\Psi_{\\text{total}} = \\Psi_{\\text{spatial}} \\otimes \\Psi_{\\text{spin}}$ must be antisymmetric with respect to the exchange of two electrons.\n\nThe possible total spin quantum numbers for two electrons are $S=0$ (singlet) and $S=1$ (triplet). The singlet spin function is antisymmetric, while the triplet spin functions are symmetric.\n- For a symmetric spatial function ($\\Psi_{\\text{spatial, S}}$), the spin function must be antisymmetric (singlet, $S=0$).\n- For an antisymmetric spatial function ($\\Psi_{\\text{spatial, A}}$), the spin function must be symmetric (triplet, $S=1$).\n\nThe direct product $\\Pi_{g} \\otimes \\Pi_{g}$ decomposes into a symmetric and an antisymmetric part:\n- Symmetric spatial states: $[\\Pi_{g} \\otimes \\Pi_{g}]_{\\text{sym}} = \\Sigma_{g}^{+} + \\Delta_{g}$. These must be paired with the singlet spin function, yielding terms ${}^{1}\\Sigma_{g}^{+}$ and ${}^{1}\\Delta_{g}$.\n- Antisymmetric spatial state: $\\{\\Pi_{g} \\otimes \\Pi_{g}\\}_{\\text{antisym}} = \\Sigma_{g}^{-}$. This must be paired with the triplet spin functions, yielding the term ${}^{3}\\Sigma_{g}^{-}$.\n\nThus, the allowed electronic terms are ${}^{3}\\Sigma_{g}^{-}$, ${}^{1}\\Delta_{g}$, and ${}^{1}\\Sigma_{g}^{+}$. The gerade ($g$) parity of all terms is a direct consequence of the product of the parities of the individual orbitals: $g \\otimes g = g$.\n\nThe reflection label $\\pm$ for $\\Sigma$ states is determined by the behavior of the spatial wavefunction upon reflection in a plane containing the internuclear axis, for instance, the $xz$-plane ($\\hat{\\sigma}_{v}(xz)$). The real orbitals transform as: $\\hat{\\sigma}_{v}(xz) \\varphi_{x} = +\\varphi_{x}$ and $\\hat{\\sigma}_{v}(xz) \\varphi_{y} = -\\varphi_{y}$.\nThe antisymmetric spatial function corresponding to the triplet state is $\\Psi_{\\text{spatial, A}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[\\varphi_{x}(1)\\varphi_{y}(2) - \\varphi_{y}(1)\\varphi_{x}(2)]$.\nApplying the reflection operator:\n$$\n\\hat{\\sigma}_{v}(xz) \\Psi_{\\text{spatial, A}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[(+\\varphi_{x}(1))(-\\varphi_{y}(2)) - (-\\varphi_{y}(1))(+\\varphi_{x}(2))] = -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[\\varphi_{x}(1)\\varphi_{y}(2) - \\varphi_{y}(1)\\varphi_{x}(2)] = -1 \\cdot \\Psi_{\\text{spatial, A}}\n$$\nThis wavefunction is antisymmetric with respect to reflection, hence it is a $\\Sigma^{-}$ state, confirming the ${}^{3}\\Sigma_{g}^{-}$ term symbol. A similar analysis for the symmetric spatial functions would show one combination corresponding to $\\Sigma_{g}^{+}$ and two corresponding to $\\Delta_{g}$.\n\nAccording to Hund's rules for molecules, the term with the highest spin multiplicity has the lowest energy. The triplet state (${}^{3}\\Sigma_{g}^{-}$, $S=1$) is therefore lower in energy than the singlet states (${}^{1}\\Delta_{g}$, ${}^{1}\\Sigma_{g}^{+}$, $S=0$). The lowest-energy term, the ground state, is ${}^{3}\\Sigma_{g}^{-}$. This energetic preference is due to the exchange interaction; the spatially antisymmetric wavefunction of the triplet state minimizes electron-electron repulsion by keeping the electrons apart. Of the singlet states, the one with the larger orbital angular momentum projection $\\Lambda$ is lower in energy. Thus, ${}^{1}\\Delta_{g}$ ($\\Lambda=2$) is lower in energy than ${}^{1}\\Sigma_{g}^{+}$ ($\\Lambda=0$). The overall energy ordering is $E({}^{3}\\Sigma_{g}^{-})  E({}^{1}\\Delta_{g})  E({}^{1}\\Sigma_{g}^{+})$.\n\nThe problem requires deriving the energies of the lowest triplet (${}^{3}\\Sigma_{g}^{-}$) and the lowest singlet (${}^{1}\\Delta_{g}$) in terms of $J_{\\pi_{x}\\pi_{y}}$ and $K_{\\pi_{x}\\pi_{y}}$. The Hamiltonian for the two active electrons is $\\hat{H} = \\hat{h}(1) + \\hat{h}(2) + \\hat{g}(1,2)$, where $\\hat{h}$ is the one-electron operator. Since $\\varphi_{x}$ and $\\varphi_{y}$ are degenerate eigenfunctions of $\\hat{h}$ with eigenvalue $\\epsilon_{\\pi_{g}^{\\ast}}$, the one-electron energy for any state is $2\\epsilon_{\\pi_{g}^{\\ast}}$. Energy differences arise from the two-electron repulsion term, $\\hat{g}(1,2)$.\n\nThe spatial wavefunction for the ${}^{3}\\Sigma_{g}^{-}$ state is $\\Psi_{A} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[\\varphi_{x}(1)\\varphi_{y}(2) - \\varphi_{y}(1)\\varphi_{x}(2)]$. Its repulsion energy is:\n$$\n\\langle\\Psi_{A}|\\hat{g}|\\Psi_{A}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} \\langle \\varphi_{x}(1)\\varphi_{y}(2) - \\varphi_{y}(1)\\varphi_{x}(2) | \\hat{g} | \\varphi_{x}(1)\\varphi_{y}(2) - \\varphi_{y}(1)\\varphi_{x}(2) \\rangle\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{2} [ \\langle \\varphi_{x}\\varphi_{y}|\\hat{g}|\\varphi_{x}\\varphi_{y}\\rangle - \\langle \\varphi_{x}\\varphi_{y}|\\hat{g}|\\varphi_{y}\\varphi_{x}\\rangle - \\langle \\varphi_{y}\\varphi_{x}|\\hat{g}|\\varphi_{x}\\varphi_{y}\\rangle + \\langle \\varphi_{y}\\varphi_{x}|\\hat{g}|\\varphi_{y}\\varphi_{x}\\rangle ]\n$$\nBy the definitions provided, $\\langle \\varphi_{x}\\varphi_{y}|\\hat{g}|\\varphi_{x}\\varphi_{y}\\rangle = J_{\\pi_{x}\\pi_{y}}$ and $\\langle \\varphi_{x}\\varphi_{y}|\\hat{g}|\\varphi_{y}\\varphi_{x}\\rangle = K_{\\pi_{x}\\pi_{y}}$. Since the integrals are real, $\\langle \\varphi_{y}\\varphi_{x}|\\hat{g}|\\varphi_{x}\\varphi_{y}\\rangle = K_{\\pi_{x}\\pi_{y}}$ and $\\langle \\varphi_{y}\\varphi_{x}|\\hat{g}|\\varphi_{y}\\varphi_{x}\\rangle = J_{\\pi_{x}\\pi_{y}}$.\n$$\n\\langle\\Psi_{A}|\\hat{g}|\\Psi_{A}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}[J_{\\pi_{x}\\pi_{y}} - K_{\\pi_{x}\\pi_{y}} - K_{\\pi_{x}\\pi_{y}} + J_{\\pi_{x}\\pi_{y}}] = J_{\\pi_{x}\\pi_{y}} - K_{\\pi_{x}\\pi_{y}}\n$$\nSo, $E({}^{3}\\Sigma_{g}^{-}) = 2\\epsilon_{\\pi_{g}^{\\ast}} + J_{\\pi_{x}\\pi_{y}} - K_{\\pi_{x}\\pi_{y}}$.\n\nThe ${}^{1}\\Delta_{g}$ state is two-fold degenerate. One of its spatial components is given by the symmetric combination $\\Psi_{S} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[\\varphi_{x}(1)\\varphi_{y}(2) + \\varphi_{y}(1)\\varphi_{x}(2)]$. The repulsion energy for this state component is:\n$$\n\\langle\\Psi_{S}|\\hat{g}|\\Psi_{S}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2} \\langle \\varphi_{x}(1)\\varphi_{y}(2) + \\varphi_{y}(1)\\varphi_{x}(2) | \\hat{g} | \\varphi_{x}(1)\\varphi_{y}(2) + \\varphi_{y}(1)\\varphi_{x}(2) \\rangle\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{2} [ \\langle \\varphi_{x}\\varphi_{y}|\\hat{g}|\\varphi_{x}\\varphi_{y}\\rangle + \\langle \\varphi_{x}\\varphi_{y}|\\hat{g}|\\varphi_{y}\\varphi_{x}\\rangle + \\langle \\varphi_{y}\\varphi_{x}|\\hat{g}|\\varphi_{x}\\varphi_{y}\\rangle + \\langle \\varphi_{y}\\varphi_{x}|\\hat{g}|\\varphi_{y}\\varphi_{x}\\rangle ]\n$$\n$$\n\\langle\\Psi_{S}|\\hat{g}|\\Psi_{S}\\rangle = \\frac{1}{2}[J_{\\pi_{x}\\pi_{y}} + K_{\\pi_{x}\\pi_{y}} + K_{\\pi_{x}\\pi_{y}} + J_{\\pi_{x}\\pi_{y}}] = J_{\\pi_{x}\\pi_{y}} + K_{\\pi_{x}\\pi_{y}}\n$$\nSince components of a degenerate term must have the same energy, the energy of the ${}^{1}\\Delta_{g}$ state is $E({}^{1}\\Delta_{g}) = 2\\epsilon_{\\pi_{g}^{\\ast}} + J_{\\pi_{x}\\pi_{y}} + K_{\\pi_{x}\\pi_{y}}$. The problem is constructed such that this calculation is sufficient, avoiding integrals such as $J_{\\pi_{x}\\pi_{x}}$ which would be needed for the ${}^{1}\\Sigma_{g}^{+}$ state.\n\nFinally, the singlet-triplet gap $\\Delta E$ is the difference between the energy of the lowest singlet state (${}^{1}\\Delta_{g}$) and the triplet ground state (${}^{3}\\Sigma_{g}^{-}$).\n$$\n\\Delta E \\equiv E({}^{1}\\Delta_{g}) - E({}^{3}\\Sigma_{g}^{-}) = (2\\epsilon_{\\pi_{g}^{\\ast}} + J_{\\pi_{x}\\pi_{y}} + K_{\\pi_{x}\\pi_{y}}) - (2\\epsilon_{\\pi_{g}^{\\ast}} + J_{\\pi_{x}\\pi_{y}} - K_{\\pi_{x}\\pi_{y}})\n$$\n$$\n\\Delta E = (J_{\\pi_{x}\\pi_{y}} + K_{\\pi_{x}\\pi_{y}}) - (J_{\\pi_{x}\\pi_{y}} - K_{\\pi_{x}\\pi_{y}}) = 2K_{\\pi_{x}\\pi_{y}}\n$$\nThe gap is simply twice the exchange integral.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{2K_{\\pi_{x}\\pi_{y}}}\n$$", "id": "2946756"}]}
