Use the following well-tested formulation of Slater’s rules (for an $ns$ or $np$ valence electron) as your starting point:\n- Group the electron configuration as $(1s)$, $(2s,2p)$, $(3s,3p)$, $(3d)$, $(4s,4p)$, $(4d)$, $(4f)$, $(5s,5p)$, and so on.\n- For the $ns$ or $np$ electron of interest:\n  - Each other electron in the same $(ns,np)$ group contributes $0.35$ to $S$ (use $0.30$ instead if the group is $(1s)$).\n  - Each electron in the $(n-1)$ shell [$(n-1)s,(n-1)p$] contributes $0.85$ to $S$.\n  - Each electron in groups with principal quantum number less than $(n-1)$, and all $d$ and $f$ electrons in any lower group, contributes $1.00$ to $S$.\n\nAssume nonrelativistic electrons and ignore spin-orbit coupling and electron correlation beyond what is implicitly captured by Slater’s rules.

It relies on a specified formulation of Slater's rules, which are a standard, albeit simplified, approximation in general chemistry for estimating effective nuclear charge. The data provided are correct and sufficient for the tasks demanded. Thus, we proceed with the solution.\n\nThe core of the problem is the computation of the screening constant, $S$, and the effective nuclear charge, $Z_{\\text{eff}}$, for the valence electron of the first three alkali metals using the provided rules. The relationship is given by $Z_{\\text{eff}} = Z - S$, where $Z$ is the atomic number.\n\nTask 1: Computation of $S$ and $Z_{\\text{eff}}$.\n\nFor Lithium (Li):\nThe atomic number is $Z=3$, and the ground-state electron configuration is $1s^{2}\\,2s^{1}$. The electron of interest is the single valence electron in the $n=2$ shell.\nWe group the configuration as $(1s)^2(2s)^1$.\nTo calculate the screening constant $S$ for the $2s$ electron, we consider the other electrons:\n- There are no other electrons in the same $n=2$ group.\n- There are $2$ electrons in the $(n-1)$ shell, which corresponds to the $(1s)$ group. According to the rules, these contribute $0.85$ each to $S$.\nTherefore, the screening constant for lithium is calculated as:\n$$S_{\\text{Li}} = 2 \\times 0.85 = 1.70$$\nThe effective nuclear charge experienced by the $2s$ electron is:\n$$Z_{\\text{eff, Li}} = Z - S_{\\text{Li}} = 3 - 1.70 = 1.30$$\n\nFor Sodium (Na):\nThe atomic number is $Z=11$, and the configuration is $1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}\\,2p^{6}\\,3s^{1}$. The valence electron is in the $n=3$ shell.\nWe group the configuration as $(1s)^2(2s, 2p)^8(3s)^1$.\nTo calculate $S$ for the $3s$ electron:\n- There are no other electrons in the same $n=3$ group.\n- There are $8$ electrons in the $(n-1)$ shell, which is the $(2s, 2p)$ group. These contribute $0.85$ each.\n- There are $2$ electrons in the $(n-2)$ shell, the $(1s)$ group. These contribute $1.00$ each.\nThe screening constant for sodium is:\n$$S_{\\text{Na}} = (8 \\times 0.85) + (2 \\times 1.00) = 6.80 + 2.00 = 8.80$$\nThe effective nuclear charge is:\n$$Z_{\\text{eff, Na}} = Z - S_{\\text{Na}} = 11 - 8.80 = 2.20$$\n\nFor Potassium (K):\nThe atomic number is $Z=19$, and the configuration is $1s^{2}\\,2s^{2}\\,2p^{6}\\,3s^{2}\\,3p^{6}\\,4s^{1}$. The valence electron is in the $n=4$ shell.\nWe group the configuration as $(1s)^2(2s, 2p)^8(3s, 3p)^8(4s)^1$.\nTo calculate $S$ for the $4s$ electron:\n- There are no other electrons in the same $n=4$ group.\n- There are $8$ electrons in the $(n-1)$ shell, the $(3s, 3p)$ group. These contribute $0.85$ each.\n- There are $10$ electrons in shells with principal quantum number less than $(n-1)$. These are the $8$ electrons in the $(2s, 2p)$ group and the $2$ electrons in the $(1s)$ group. All contribute $1.00$ each.\nThe screening constant for potassium is:\n$$S_{\\text{K}} = (8 \\times 0.85) + ((8+2) \\times 1.00) = 6.80 + 10.00 = 16.80$$\nThe effective nuclear charge is:\n$$Z_{\\text{eff, K}} = Z - S_{\\text{K}} = 19 - 16.80 = 2.20$$\n\nTask 2: Physical limitations of the model.\nShielding is the effect where inner-shell electrons reduce the electrostatic attraction between the nucleus and an outer-shell electron. Penetration describes the probability of an outer electron being found close to the nucleus, inside the charge clouds of inner electrons, thus experiencing a larger fraction of the nuclear charge.\n\nSlater's rules are a coarse, semi-empirical model that approximates these quantum mechanical effects with a set of fixed shielding coefficients. The limitations become more pronounced for heavier alkali metals for several reasons:\n1.  **Diffuse Orbitals**: As $n$ increases, the valence $ns$ orbital becomes larger and more diffuse. The simple categorization of shielding electrons into discrete shells with fixed coefficients ($0.85$ for $(n-1)$, $1.00$ for inner) fails to capture the continuous nature of electron density distributions and the complex overlap between the valence orbital and the various core orbitals.\n2.  **Incomplete Shielding by d/f Electrons**: For heavier alkali metals (e.g., Rb, Cs), the core includes filled $d$ and eventually $f$ subshells. These orbitals are less penetrating and more diffuse than $s$ and $p$ orbitals of the same principal quantum number, making them relatively poor shielders. Slater's rules, in this formulation, assign a perfect shielding contribution of $1.00$ to all electrons in shells below $(n-1)$, which overestimates the shielding effectiveness of these $d$ and $f$ electrons.\n3.  **Relativistic Effects**: For heavy elements, the inner core electrons move at speeds that are a significant fraction of the speed of light, leading to relativistic contraction of core $s$ and $p$ orbitals. This contraction increases their shielding effectiveness. These effects are completely ignored in the nonrelativistic model of Slater's rules.\n\nThe apparent constancy of $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ for Na ($2.20$) and K ($2.20$) is a mathematical artifact of this specific set of rules for alkali metals. For any alkali metal from Na downwards, with valence configuration $ns^1$, the $(n-1)$ shell is a filled $(n-1)s, (n-1)p$ shell containing $8$ electrons. The rules assign a shielding of $0.85$ to these. All electrons in shells $(n-2)$ and deeper are assigned a shielding of $1.00$. When moving from an element with nuclear charge $Z$ and valence shell $n$ to the next one with charge $Z'$ and valence shell $(n+1)$, we add a full shell of electrons to the core. The rules essentially state that the increase in nuclear charge, $\\Delta Z = Z' - Z$, is perfectly cancelled by the addition of $\\Delta Z$ core electrons that each provide perfect shielding (a contribution of $1.00$). For example, from Na to K, $Z$ increases by $8$, and $8$ electrons are added to the new $(n-2)$ shell (the original $(n-1)$ shell of Na), which all screen with a factor of $1.00$. This structure forces $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ to remain constant in the model:\n$$Z_{\\text{eff}} = Z - S = Z - [8 \\times 0.85 + (\\text{number of deeper electrons}) \\times 1.00]$$\nSince the number of deeper electrons is $Z - 9$ (for $n>2$), we find:\n$$Z_{\\text{eff}} = Z - [6.80 + (Z - 9) \\times 1.00] = Z - (6.80 + Z - 9) = Z - Z + 2.20 = 2.20$$\nThis algebraic result demonstrates that the constancy is an artifact of the model's construction, not a reflection of precise physical reality. More sophisticated calculations, such as Hartree-Fock, show a gradual increase in $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ down the group.\n\nTask 3: Arithmetic mean of $Z_{\\text{eff}}$ values.\nThe computed values are $Z_{\\text{eff, Li}} = 1.30$, $Z_{\\text{eff, Na}} = 2.20$, and $Z_{\\text{eff, K}} = 2.20$. The arithmetic mean is:\n$$\\text{Mean} = \\frac{1.30 + 2.20 + 2.20}{3} = \\frac{5.70}{3} = 1.90$$\nThe result is required to three significant figures.

However, the task is to perform a calculation with the *given* data, not to validate the empirical accuracy of that data. The problem is a self-contained theoretical exercise. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a solution will be constructed.\n\nThe total lattice energy, $U_{\\text{latt}}$, for one mole of a $1:1$ ionic crystal is the sum of the electrostatic (Coulombic) energy and the short-range repulsive energy, multiplied by Avogadro's number, $N_{A}$.

The ratio is a product of two terms: the ratio of interionic distances, $\\frac{r_{0, \\text{CsF}}}{r_{0, \\text{LiF}}}$, and the ratio of the repulsion correction factors, $\\frac{1 - 1/n_{\\text{LiF}}}{1 - 1/n_{\\text{CsF}}}$.\nThe ratio of distances is $\\frac{3.00}{2.23} \\approx 1.345$.\nThe ratio of the repulsion factors is $\\frac{1 - 1/9.0}{1 - 1/7.0} = \\frac{8/9}{6/7} \\approx \\frac{0.8889}{0.8571} \\approx 1.037$.\nThe interionic distance ratio ($\\approx 1.345$) is significantly larger than the repulsion factor ratio ($\\approx 1.037$). This demonstrates that the primary determinant of the lattice energy is the Coulombic attraction, which scales as $1/r_{0}$. Since $r_{0, \\text{LiF}}$ is substantially smaller than $r_{0, \\text{CsF}}$, the electrostatic attraction in $\\text{LiF}$ is much stronger, leading to a significantly larger (more negative) lattice energy. The Born exponent $n$, which accounts for short-range repulsion, modifies the energy by a smaller amount, typically around $10-15\\%$, as reflected by the term $(1 - 1/n)$. The difference in $n$ values between the two compounds provides only a minor correction to the overall ratio.

The total free energy for this entire hydrogen process constitutes a constant contribution, which we will denote as $C$.\n\nAccording to Hess's law, the total Gibbs free energy change for the cell reaction is the sum of the energy changes of these steps:\n$$ \\Delta G^{\\circ}_{\\text{cell}} \\approx \\Delta H_{\\text{sub}}(\\text{M}) + IE_{1}(\\text{M}) + \\Delta G_{\\text{hyd}}(\\text{M}^{+}) + C $$\nHere we have used the approximations $\\Delta G_{\\text{sub}} \\approx \\Delta H_{\\text{sub}}$ and $\\Delta G_{\\text{ion}} \\approx IE_1$ as implied by the problem statement, which provides enthalpy for sublimation and ionization energy.\nTherefore, for any metal $\\text{M}$:\n$$ \\mathcal{F}E^{\\circ}(\\text{M}^{+}/\\text{M}) \\approx \\Delta H_{\\text{sub}}(\\text{M}) + IE_{1}(\\text{M}) + \\Delta G_{\\text{hyd}}(\\text{M}^{+}) + C $$\nApplying this relation to sodium ($\\text{Na}$) and potassium ($\\text{K}$):\n$$ \\mathcal{F}E^{\\circ}(\\text{Na}^{+}/\\text{Na}) \\approx \\Delta H_{\\text{sub}}(\\text{Na}) + IE_{1}(\\text{Na}) + \\Delta G_{\\text{hyd}}(\\text{Na}^{+}) + C $$\n$$ \\mathcal{F}E^{\\circ}(\\text{K}^{+}/\\text{K}) \\approx \\Delta H_{\\text{sub}}(\\text{K}) + IE_{1}(\\text{K}) + \\Delta G_{\\text{hyd}}(\\text{K}^{+}) + C $$\nSubtracting the second equation from the first, the constant term $C$ pertaining to the hydrogen electrode cancels out:\n$$ \\mathcal{F} [E^{\\circ}(\\text{Na}^{+}/\\text{Na}) - E^{\\circ}(\\text{K}^{+}/\\text{K})] \\approx [\\Delta H_{\\text{sub}}(\\text{Na}) - \\Delta H_{\\text{sub}}(\\text{K})] + [IE_{1}(\\text{Na}) - IE_{1}(\\text{K})] + [\\Delta G_{\\text{hyd}}(\\text{Na}^{+}) - \\Delta G_{\\text{hyd}}(\\text{K}^{+})] $$\nLet $\\Delta E^{\\circ} = E^{\\circ}(\\text{Na}^{+}/\\text{Na}) - E^{\\circ}(\\text{K}^{+}/\\text{K})$. We can now substitute the given values, ensuring all energies are in joules per mole.\nThe data are:\nFor Sodium: $\\Delta H_{\\text{sub}}(\\text{Na}) = 108.7\\ \\text{kJ/mol}$, $IE_{1}(\\text{Na}) = 495.9\\ \\text{kJ/mol}$, $\\Delta G_{\\text{hyd}}(\\text{Na}^{+}) = -365.0\\ \\text{kJ/mol}$.\nFor Potassium: $\\Delta H_{\\text{sub}}(\\text{K}) = 89.2\\ \\text{kJ/mol}$, $IE_{1}(\\text{K}) = 418.8\\ \\text{kJ/mol}$, $\\Delta G_{\\text{hyd}}(\\text{K}^{+}) = -295.0\\ \\text{kJ/mol}$.\nThe Faraday constant is $\\mathcal{F} = 96485\\ \\text{J V}^{-1}\\text{mol}^{-1}$.\n\nCalculate the differences for each term:\n$$ \\Delta(\\Delta H_{\\text{sub}}) = 108.7 - 89.2 = 19.5\\ \\text{kJ/mol} $$\n$$ \\Delta(IE_{1}) = 495.9 - 418.8 = 77.1\\ \\text{kJ/mol} $$\n$$ \\Delta(\\Delta G_{\\text{hyd}}) = -365.0 - (-295.0) = -70.0\\ \\text{kJ/mol} $$\nThe total energy difference is:\n$$ \\mathcal{F} \\Delta E^{\\circ} \\approx (19.5 + 77.1 - 70.0)\\ \\text{kJ/mol} = 26.6\\ \\text{kJ/mol} = 26600\\ \\text{J/mol} $$\nNow, solving for $\\Delta E^{\\circ}$:\n$$ \\Delta E^{\\circ} \\approx \\frac{26600\\ \\text{J/mol}}{96485\\ \\text{J V}^{-1}\\text{mol}^{-1}} \\approx 0.27569\\ \\text{V} $$\nRounding to three significant figures as required:\n$$ \\Delta E^{\\circ} \\approx 0.276\\ \\text{V} $$\n\nFor the second task, we analyze the sensitivity to uncertainties. The calculated potential difference is notably sensitive to uncertainties in hydration free energies, as these terms are large and their difference significantly impacts the total energy budget. Propagating the independent uncertainties of $\\pm 4.0\\ \\text{kJ/mol}$ for each hydration free energy, the uncertainty in their difference, $\\delta(\\Delta(\\Delta G_{\\text{hyd}}))$, is given by the sum of squares:\n$$ \\delta(\\Delta(\\Delta G_{\\text{hyd}})) = \\sqrt{(4.0\\ \\text{kJ/mol})^2 + (4.0\\ \\text{kJ/mol})^2} = \\sqrt{32.0}\\ \\text{kJ/mol} \\approx 5.657\\ \\text{kJ/mol} $$\nThe resulting uncertainty in the potential difference, $\\delta(\\Delta E^{\\circ})$, is then:\n$$ \\delta(\\Delta E^{\\circ}) = \\frac{\\delta(\\Delta(\\Delta G_{\\text{hyd}}))}{\\mathcal{F}} = \\frac{5657\\ \\text{J/mol}}{96485\\ \\text{J V}^{-1}\\text{mol}^{-1}} \\approx 0.059\\ \\text{V} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.276}$$", "id": "2940617"}]}
