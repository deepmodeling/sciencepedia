Solving for $\\lambda^2$ gives $\\lambda^2 = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{5}}{2}$. The four eigenvalues are $\\lambda_k = \\{\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{3+\\sqrt{5}}{2}}, \\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{3-\\sqrt{5}}{2}}\\}$. These can be simplified to $\\lambda_k = \\{\\pm\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}, \\pm\\frac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{2}\\}$.\nThe $N_{\\pi} = 4$ electrons of butadiene occupy the two lowest-energy molecular orbitals. Since $\\beta < 0$, these correspond to the two largest positive eigenvalues of $\\mathbf{A}$:\n$\\lambda_1 = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$\n$\\lambda_2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{2}$\nThe energies of these occupied orbitals are:\n$E_1 = \\alpha + \\beta(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2})$\n$E_2 = \\alpha + \\beta(\\frac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{2})$\nThe total $\\pi$-electron energy of $1,3$-butadiene is the sum of the energies of the occupied orbitals, accounting for two electrons per orbital:\n$E_{\\pi}(\\text{1,3-butadiene}) = 2E_1 + 2E_2 = 2[\\alpha + \\beta(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2})] + 2[\\alpha + \\beta(\\frac{\\sqrt{5}-1}{2})]$\n$E_{\\pi}(\\text{1,3-butadiene}) = 4\\alpha + \\beta(1+\\sqrt{5}) + \\beta(\\sqrt{5}-1) = 4\\alpha + 2\\sqrt{5}\\beta$.\n\nTask 4: Quantifying Instability\nFirst, we compute the total $\\pi$-electron energy of cyclobutadiene. Based on its electron configuration ($2$ electrons in $E_1=\\alpha+2\\beta$, $1$ electron in $E_2=\\alpha$, $1$ electron in $E_3=\\alpha$):\n$E_{\\pi}(\\mathrm{C_{4}H_{4}}) = 2(\\alpha+2\\beta) + 1(\\alpha) + 1(\\alpha) = 4\\alpha + 4\\beta$.\nThe destabilization energy, $\\Delta E$, is the difference between the total $\\pi$-electron energy of cyclobutadiene and its acyclic analogue, $1,3$-butadiene:\n$\\Delta E = E_{\\pi}(\\mathrm{C_{4}H_{4}}) - E_{\\pi}(\\text{1,3-butadiene})$\n$\\Delta E = (4\\alpha + 4\\beta) - (4\\alpha + 2\\sqrt{5}\\beta)$\n$\\Delta E = 4\\beta - 2\\sqrt{5}\\beta = (4 - 2\\sqrt{5})\\beta$.\nSince $\\beta < 0$ and $(4 - 2\\sqrt{5}) \\approx -0.472 < 0$, the value of $\\Delta E$ is positive. This positive energy difference confirms that the cyclic system is less stable than the open-chain system, which is the energetic signature of antiaromaticity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{(4 - 2\\sqrt{5})\\beta}$$", "id": "2933924"}]}
