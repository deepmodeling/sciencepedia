The problem is a standard exercise in chemical thermodynamics and is valid.\n\nThe fundamental criterion for chemical equilibrium is derived from the chemical potential, $\\mu_i$. For an ideal solution, the chemical potential of species $i$ is given by $\\mu_i = \\mu_i^\\circ + RT \\ln a_i$, where $\\mu_i^\\circ$ is the standard chemical potential, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $a_i$ is the activity of species $i$. The Gibbs free energy of reaction, $\\Delta_r G$, is the change in Gibbs free energy per extent of reaction, given by $\\Delta_r G = \\sum_i \\nu_i \\mu_i$, where $\\nu_i$ are the stoichiometric coefficients ($\\nu_{\\mathrm{A}} = -1$, $\\nu_{\\mathrm{B}} = -1$, $\\nu_{\\mathrm{C}} = 1$).\n\nSubstituting the expression for $\\mu_i$ yields:\n$$ \\Delta_r G = (\\mu_{\\mathrm{C}}^\\circ - \\mu_{\\mathrm{A}}^\\circ - \\mu_{\\mathrm{B}}^\\circ) + RT \\ln \\left( \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{C}}}{a_{\\mathrm{A}} a_{\\mathrm{B}}} \\right) $$\nWe define the standard Gibbs free energy of reaction as $\\Delta_r G^\\circ = \\mu_{\\mathrm{C}}^\\circ - \\mu_{\\mathrm{A}}^\\circ - \\mu_{\\mathrm{B}}^\\circ$ and the reaction quotient as $Q = \\frac{a_{\\mathrm{C}}}{a_{\\mathrm{A}} a_{\\mathrm{B}}}$. Thus, $\\Delta_r G = \\Delta_r G^\\circ + RT \\ln Q$.\nAt equilibrium, $\\Delta_r G = 0$ and $Q$ is equal to the equilibrium constant $K$. This gives the fundamental relation $\\Delta_r G^\\circ = -RT \\ln K$.\nThe condition for a spontaneous process at constant $T$ and $P$ (or in this fixed volume system, reaction spontaneity) is $\\Delta_r G  0$.

Since $Q  K$, the Gibbs energy of reaction $\\Delta_r G$ is negative, and the reaction will spontaneously proceed in the forward direction ($\\mathrm{A}+\\mathrm{B}\\rightarrow\\mathrm{C}$) to establish a new equilibrium.\n\nTo find the new equilibrium composition, we start from the perturbed state and let the extent of reaction change by an additional amount $\\Delta\\xi$.\nThe new equilibrium molar amounts will be:\n$n_{\\mathrm{A,eq2}} = 0.12283 - \\Delta\\xi$\n$n_{\\mathrm{B,eq2}} = 0.17283 - \\Delta\\xi$\n$n_{\\mathrm{C,eq2}} = 0.37717 + \\Delta\\xi$\nApplying the equilibrium condition again with $V=1.000~\\mathrm{L}$:\n$$ 25.00 = \\frac{0.37717 + \\Delta\\xi}{(0.12283 - \\Delta\\xi)(0.17283 - \\Delta\\xi)} $$\nExpanding and rearranging this expression leads to the quadratic equation for $\\Delta\\xi$:\n$$ 25.00 (\\Delta\\xi)^2 - 8.3915 \\Delta\\xi + 0.15348 = 0 $$\nSolving with the quadratic formula: $\\Delta\\xi = \\frac{8.3915 \\pm \\sqrt{(-8.3915)^2 - 4(25.00)(0.15348)}}{2(25.00)} = \\frac{8.3915 \\pm \\sqrt{55.069}}{50.00}$.\nThe two roots are $\\Delta\\xi \\approx 0.3162~\\mathrm{mol}$ and $\\Delta\\xi \\approx 0.01941~\\mathrm{mol}$.

We are given that the standard reaction enthalpy, $\\Delta H^{\\circ} = +75.0 \\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}}$, is independent of temperature.

The reaction quotient in terms of partial pressures is given by:\n$$ Q_p = \\frac{p_C}{p_A p_B} $$\nFor an ideal gas mixture, the partial pressure of a component $i$ is $p_i = x_i P_{total}$, where $x_i$ is its mole fraction and $P_{total}$ is the total pressure. Substituting this into the expression for $Q_p$:\n$$ Q_p = \\frac{x_C P_{total}}{(x_A P_{total})(x_B P_{total})} = \\frac{x_C}{x_A x_B} \\frac{1}{P_{total}} $$\nThe problem states that the perturbation is rapid, so the mole numbers of the species ($n_A, n_B, n_C$) do not change initially. Consequently, the mole fractions ($x_A, x_B, x_C$) also remain unchanged during the transition from the initial state $(T_1, P_1)$ to the final state $(T_2, P_2)$.\nAt the initial equilibrium state, the reaction quotient equals the equilibrium constant:\n$$ K_p(T_1) = \\frac{p_{C,1}}{p_{A,1} p_{B,1}} = \\frac{x_C P_1}{(x_A P_1)(x_B P_1)} = \\frac{x_C}{x_A x_B} \\frac{1}{P_1} $$\nFrom this, we can express the ratio of mole fractions as a function of initial conditions:\n$$ \\frac{x_C}{x_A x_B} = K_p(T_1) P_1 $$\nNow, we can write the reaction quotient $Q_p$ at the final state $(T_2, P_2)$, using the same mole fractions but the new total pressure $P_2$:\n$$ Q_p(T_2, P_2) = \\frac{x_C}{x_A x_B} \\frac{1}{P_2} = (K_p(T_1) P_1) \\frac{1}{P_2} = K_p(T_1) \\frac{P_1}{P_2} $$\nTaking the logarithm:\n$$ \\ln(Q_p(T_2, P_2)) = \\ln(K_p(T_1)) + \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right) $$\n\nNow we can assemble the expression for $S$:\n$$ S = \\ln(Q_p(T_2, P_2)) - \\ln(K_p(T_2)) $$\nSubstituting the expressions derived above:\n$$ S = \\left[ \\ln(K_p(T_1)) + \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right) \\right] - \\left[ \\ln(K_p(T_1)) + \\frac{\\Delta H^{\\circ}}{R} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2}\\right) \\right] $$\nThe term $\\ln(K_p(T_1))$ cancels, yielding a simplified expression for $S$ that depends only on the given physical parameters of the perturbation and reaction:\n$$ S = \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right) - \\frac{\\Delta H^{\\circ}}{R} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2}\\right) $$\nWe are given the following numerical values:\n$P_1 = 1.760\\ \\mathrm{bar}$\n$P_2 = 17.60\\ \\mathrm{bar}$\n$\\Delta H^{\\circ} = 75.0 \\times 10^3\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}}$\n$R = 8.3145\\ \\mathrm{J\\ mol^{-1}\\ K^{-1}}$\n$T_1 = 500.0\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n$T_2 = 550.0\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n\nWe calculate each term separately.\nThe pressure term:\n$$ \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_1}{P_2}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{1.760}{17.60}\\right) = \\ln(0.1) = -2.302585... $$\nThe temperature-enthalpy term:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta H^{\\circ}}{R} \\left(\\frac{1}{T_1} - \\frac{1}{T_2}\\right) = \\frac{75000}{8.3145} \\left(\\frac{1}{500.0} - \\frac{1}{550.0}\\right) = \\frac{75000}{8.3145} \\left(\\frac{550.0 - 500.0}{500.0 \\times 550.0}\\right) $$\n$$ = \\frac{75000}{8.3145} \\left(\\frac{50.0}{275000}\\right) \\approx (9020.386) \\times (1.81818 \\times 10^{-4}) \\approx 1.640070... $$\nFinally, we compute $S$:\n$$ S \\approx -2.302585 - 1.640070 = -3.942655 $$\nRounding the result to four significant figures, as requested:\n$$ S \\approx -3.943 $$\nThe negative sign indicates that $\\Delta G_2  0$, and the system will spontaneously shift to the right (towards product $\\ce{C}$) to attain the new equilibrium state at $(T_2, P_2)$.

It is found to be scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. The problem is a standard exercise in chemical equilibrium, involving the interplay of solubility and complex formation, which is a quantitative application of Le Châtelier's principle. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**. We proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe system involves two simultaneous equilibria. The first is the dissolution of the sparingly soluble salt $AB(s)$:\n$$AB(s) \\rightleftharpoons A^{+} + B^{-}$$\nThe equilibrium for this process is described by the solubility product, $K_{sp}$. Under the given assumption that activities are equal to molar concentrations, we have:\n$$K_{sp} = [A^{+}][B^{-}]$$\n\nThe second equilibrium is the formation of the complex ion $AL^{+}$ from the metal ion $A^{+}$ and the ligand $L$:\n$$A^{+} + L \\rightleftharpoons AL^{+}$$\nThis is governed by the formation constant, $K_{1}$:\n$$K_{1} = \\frac{[AL^{+}]}{[A^{+}][L]}$$\n\nFirst, we determine the solubility of $AB(s)$ in pure solvent, denoted as $s_{0}$. In the absence of the ligand $L$, the only source of $A^{+}$ and $B^{-}$ ions is the dissolution of $AB(s)$. From the stoichiometry of the dissolution, the concentrations of the ions at equilibrium are equal: $[A^{+}] = [B^{-}] = s_{0}$. Substituting these into the solubility product expression:\n$$K_{sp} = (s_{0})(s_{0}) = s_{0}^{2}$$\nThus, the solubility in pure solvent is $s_{0} = \\sqrt{K_{sp}}$.\n\nNext, we consider the system in the presence of the ligand $L$. The addition of $L$ consumes the free ion $A^{+}$ to form the complex $AL^{+}$. According to Le Châtelier's principle, the dissolution equilibrium $AB(s) \\rightleftharpoons A^{+} + B^{-}$ is subjected to a stress, which is the removal of one of its products, $A^{+}$. The system will counteract this stress by shifting the equilibrium to the right, causing more $AB(s)$ to dissolve. This results in an apparent solubility, $s_{\\mathrm{app}}$, that is greater than $s_{0}$.\n\nWe must now quantify this effect. The apparent solubility, $s_{\\mathrm{app}}$, is defined as the total molar concentration of the metal-containing species that have entered the solution from the solid phase. From the dissolution stoichiometry, for every mole of $AB(s)$ that dissolves, one mole of $B^{-}$ is produced. Therefore, the concentration of $B^{-}$ is a direct measure of the apparent solubility:\n$$s_{\\mathrm{app}} = [B^{-}]$$\nThe total concentration of species containing $A$ in solution, denoted $[A]_{\\mathrm{total}}$, is the sum of the free ion concentration and the complexed ion concentration:\n$$[A]_{\\mathrm{total}} = [A^{+}] + [AL^{+}]$$\nFrom the stoichiometry of dissolution, the total amount of $A$ in solution must equal the amount of $B$ in solution. Thus, $[A]_{\\mathrm{total}} = [B^{-}]$. Combining these mass balance relations yields the exact relation between the apparent solubility and the concentrations of the species in solution:\n$$s_{\\mathrm{app}} = [A^{+}] + [AL^{+}]$$\n\nWe can express $[AL^{+}]$ in terms of $[A^{+}]$ and $[L]$ using the formation constant $K_{1}$:\n$$[AL^{+}] = K_{1}[A^{+}][L]$$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $s_{\\mathrm{app}}$:\n$$s_{\\mathrm{app}} = [A^{+}] + K_{1}[A^{+}][L] = [A^{+}](1 + K_{1}[L])$$\nNow we use the solubility product expression, $K_{sp} = [A^{+}][B^{-}]$. Since $[B^{-}] = s_{\\mathrm{app}}$, we have $K_{sp} = [A^{+}]s_{\\mathrm{app}}$, which allows us to express $[A^{+}]$ as:\n$$[A^{+}] = \\frac{K_{sp}}{s_{\\mathrm{app}}}$$\nSubstituting this back into the equation for $s_{\\mathrm{app}}$:\n$$s_{\\mathrm{app}} = \\left(\\frac{K_{sp}}{s_{\\mathrm{app}}}\\right)(1 + K_{1}[L])$$\nRearranging this equation gives a general relationship for the apparent solubility:\n$$s_{\\mathrm{app}}^{2} = K_{sp}(1 + K_{1}[L])$$\n\nThe problem states to use the approximation that the total analytical concentration of the ligand, $C_{L}^{T}$, is much greater than the apparent solubility, i.e., $C_{L}^{T} \\gg s_{\\mathrm{app}}$. The mass balance for the ligand is:\n$$C_{L}^{T} = [L] + [AL^{+}]$$\nThe concentration of the complex, $[AL^{+}]$, is necessarily less than or equal to the total concentration of metal, $[A]_{\\mathrm{total}}$, which is equal to $s_{\\mathrm{app}}$. That is, $[AL^{+}] \\le s_{\\mathrm{app}}$. The condition $C_{L}^{T} \\gg s_{\\mathrm{app}}$ therefore implies that $C_{L}^{T} \\gg [AL^{+}]$. In this case, the amount of ligand consumed to form the complex is negligible compared to the total amount of ligand added. The mass balance for the ligand simplifies to:\n$$[L] \\approx C_{L}^{T}$$\nSubstituting this scientifically justified approximation into the expression for $s_{\\mathrm{app}}^{2}$:\n$$s_{\\mathrm{app}}^{2} \\approx K_{sp}(1 + K_{1}C_{L}^{T})$$\nTaking the square root gives the apparent solubility under this condition:\n$$s_{\\mathrm{app}} \\approx \\sqrt{K_{sp}(1 + K_{1}C_{L}^{T})}$$\n\nThe final step is to calculate the enhancement factor, $F$, defined as the ratio of the apparent solubility to the solubility in pure solvent:\n$$F \\equiv \\frac{s_{\\mathrm{app}}}{s_{0}}$$\nSubstituting the expressions we derived for $s_{\\mathrm{app}}$ and $s_{0} = \\sqrt{K_{sp}}$:\n$$F = \\frac{\\sqrt{K_{sp}(1 + K_{1}C_{L}^{T})}}{\\sqrt{K_{sp}}}$$\nCanceling the $\\sqrt{K_{sp}}$ term from the numerator and denominator yields the final expression for the enhancement factor:\n$$F = \\sqrt{1 + K_{1}C_{L}^{T}}$$\nThis expression for $F$ is a function only of the formation constant $K_{1}$ and the total ligand concentration $C_{L}^{T}$, as required by the problem statement.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\sqrt{1 + K_{1}C_{L}^{T}}}$$", "id": "2943770"}]}
