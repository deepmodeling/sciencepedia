The temperature dependence of these equilibrium constants is a well-established phenomenon. The provided data for $pK_w$ at two different temperatures are consistent with experimental observations; the autoionization of water is an endothermic process, so $K_w$ increases (and $pK_w$ decreases) with temperature. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information to evaluate the statements. The language used is objective and unambiguous. The problem setup is self-contained and free from internal contradictions or factual errors.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem statement is declared **valid**. A solution will be derived from first principles.\n\n**Derivation of the Governing Principle**\nThe equilibrium constant for the dissociation of the weak base $B$ is given by:\n$$K_b = \\frac{[BH^+][OH^-]}{[B]}$$\nThe equilibrium constant for the dissociation of its conjugate acid $BH^+$ is:\n$$K_a = \\frac{[B][H_3O^+]}{[BH^+]}$$\nThe autoionization of water is described by the equilibrium $2 H_2O \\rightleftharpoons H_3O^+ + OH^-$, with the ion product of water given by:\n$$K_w = [H_3O^+][OH^-]$$\nThese definitions are valid at any given temperature $T$.\n\nBy multiplying the expressions for $K_a$ and $K_b$, we obtain:\n$$K_a \\cdot K_b = \\left( \\frac{[B][H_3O^+]}{[BH^+]} \\right) \\left( \\frac{[BH^+][OH^-]}{[B]} \\right)$$\nSimplifying this expression yields:\n$$K_a \\cdot K_b = [H_3O^+][OH^-] = K_w$$\nThis relationship, $K_a \\cdot K_b = K_w$, holds true for any conjugate acid-base pair in aqueous solution at a constant temperature $T$. To express this in logarithmic form, we take the negative base-$10$ logarithm of both sides:\n$$-\\log_{10}(K_a \\cdot K_b) = -\\log_{10}(K_w)$$\n$$-\\log_{10}(K_a) - \\log_{10}(K_b) = -\\log_{10}(K_w)$$\nUsing the definition $pX = -\\log_{10}(X)$, this equation becomes:\n$$pK_a(T) + pK_b(T) = pK_w(T)$$\nThis equation is the correct and general relationship for converting between $pK_a$ and $pK_b$ at any temperature $T$. The common approximation $pK_a + pK_b = 14.00$ is only valid at $T = 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$ (or more precisely, at the temperature where $pK_w = 14.00$).\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\nWe are given the following values at $T = 310\\,\\mathrm{K}$:\n- $pK_a(310\\,\\mathrm{K}) = 9.00$\n- $pK_w(310\\,\\mathrm{K}) = 13.62$\nUsing the derived general relationship, we can calculate the correct value for $pK_b$ at this temperature:\n$$pK_b(310\\,\\mathrm{K}) = pK_w(310\\,\\mathrm{K}) - pK_a(310\\,\\mathrm{K})$$\n$$pK_b(310\\,\\mathrm{K}) = 13.62 - 9.00 = 4.62$$\n\nNow, we evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. At $T = 310\\,\\mathrm{K}$, the negative base-$10$ logarithm of the base dissociation constant for $B$ is $pK_b = 5.00$.**\nThis statement claims $pK_b = 5.00$. This value is obtained if one incorrectly uses the standard temperature value of $pK_w = 14.00$: $14.00 - 9.00 = 5.00$. However, the correct temperature is $310\\,\\mathrm{K}$, where $pK_w = 13.62$. Our calculation shows the correct value is $pK_b(310\\,\\mathrm{K}) = 4.62$. Therefore, the statement is based on an incorrect application of the principles.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**B. One may directly compare $pK_a(310\\,\\mathrm{K})$ to $pK_b(298\\,\\mathrm{K})$ by using $pK_a + pK_b = 14.00$, because the temperature effect on equilibrium constants of weak bases is negligible near room temperature.**\nThis statement is fundamentally flawed. The relation $pK_a(T) + pK_b(T) = pK_w(T)$ is only valid when all quantities are measured at the same temperature $T$. It is invalid to mix values from different temperatures, such as $pK_a(310\\,\\mathrm{K})$ and $pK_b(298\\,\\mathrm{K})$, in this simple additive formula. Furthermore, the assumption that the temperature effect on $K_b$ is \"negligible\" is an unsubstantiated generalization and is contradicted by the problem's own data showing a significant change in $K_w$.\nVerdict: **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. The correct conversion at $T = 310\\,\\mathrm{K}$ gives $pK_b(310\\,\\mathrm{K}) = 4.62$ for $B$.**\nThis statement is consistent with our calculation based on the correct, temperature-dependent relationship $pK_a(T) + pK_b(T) = pK_w(T)$.\n$pK_b(310\\,\\mathrm{K}) = 13.62 - 9.00 = 4.62$. The statement is factually correct.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**D. If one mistakenly uses $pK_w = 14.00$ at $T = 310\\,\\mathrm{K}$ to convert from $pK_a(310\\,\\mathrm{K}) = 9.00$, the resulting $pK_b$ is overestimated by $0.38$.**\nLet us perform the mistaken calculation:\n$pK_{b, mistaken} = 14.00 - pK_a(310\\,\\mathrm{K}) = 14.00 - 9.00 = 5.00$.\nThe correct value, as calculated previously, is $pK_{b, correct} = 4.62$.\nThe error is the difference between the mistaken value and the correct value:\nError = $pK_{b, mistaken} - pK_{b, correct} = 5.00 - 4.62 = 0.38$.\nSince the mistaken value is higher than the correct value, it is an overestimation. The magnitude of the overestimation is $0.38$. The statement is accurate.\nVerdict: **Correct**.\n\n**E. For a conjugate acid–base pair at a given temperature $T$, the appropriate correction for the temperature dependence of water autoionization when converting between $pK_a$ and $pK_b$ is to use $pK_b(T) = pK_w(T) - pK_a(T)$, rather than substituting $14.00$ for $pK_w$.**\nThis statement describes the general principle that was derived from first principles. The relationship $pK_a + pK_b = 14.00$ is a special case applicable only at $T \\approx 298\\,\\mathrm{K}$. The general and correct form at any temperature $T$ is indeed $pK_a(T) + pK_b(T) = pK_w(T)$, which rearranges to $pK_b(T) = pK_w(T) - pK_a(T)$. This statement correctly identifies the general rule and contrasts it with the common, but limited, approximation.\nVerdict: **Correct**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{CDE}$$", "id": "2964149"}, {"introduction": "The fact that Gibbs free energy is a state function has profound consequences for chemical thermodynamics, imposing a powerful constraint on reaction networks.

The ratio $M_{\\text{solvent}}/V_{\\text{solution}}$ becomes the solvent density $\\rho(T)$, which is given in units of $\\mathrm{kg\\,L^{-1}}$.\nTherefore, the relationship between molarity and molality at a given temperature $T$ is:\n$$ c_i(T) = m_i(T) \\rho(T) $$\n\nNow, we can relate the two equilibrium constants, $K_c(T)$ and $K_m(T)$. We substitute the relation $c_i = m_i \\rho(T)$ into the expression for $K_c$:\n$$ K_c(T) = \\frac{c_{\\mathrm{A}_2}(T)}{(c_{\\mathrm{A}}(T))^2} c^{\\circ} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{A}_2}(T) \\rho(T)}{(m_{\\mathrm{A}}(T) \\rho(T))^2} c^{\\circ} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{A}_2}(T)}{ (m_{\\mathrm{A}}(T))^2} \\frac{c^{\\circ}}{\\rho(T)} $$\nFrom the definition of $K_m(T)$, we have $\\frac{m_{\\mathrm{A}_2}(T)}{(m_{\\mathrm{A}}(T))^2} = \\frac{K_m(T)}{m^{\\circ}}$. Substituting this into the equation for $K_c(T)$ yields:\n$$ K_c(T) = \\left( \\frac{K_m(T)}{m^{\\circ}} \\right) \\frac{c^{\\circ}}{\\rho(T)} $$\nThis equation can be rearranged to express $K_m(T)$ in terms of $K_c(T)$:\n$$ K_m(T) = K_c(T) \\frac{m^{\\circ}}{c^{\\circ}} \\rho(T) $$\nThis relation shows how the molality-based equilibrium constant is related to the molarity-based one through the solvent density $\\rho(T)$ and the standard state definitions.\n\nThe problem provides the temperature dependencies for $K_c(T)$ and $\\rho(T)$.\nThe van 't Hoff form for $K_c(T)$ is given by:\n$$ \\ln K_{c}(T)=\\ln K_{c}(T_0)-\\frac{\\Delta H^{\\circ}}{R}\\left(\\frac{1}{T}-\\frac{1}{T_0}\\right) $$\nExponentiating both sides gives the explicit form of $K_c(T)$:\n$$ K_c(T) = K_c(T_0) \\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\Delta H^{\\circ}}{R}\\left(\\frac{1}{T}-\\frac{1}{T_0}\\right)\\right] $$\nThe temperature dependence of the solvent density is given by:\n$$ \\rho(T)=\\rho_0 \\exp\\left[-\\alpha(T-T_0)\\right] $$\nwhere $\\rho_0 = \\rho(T_0)$.\n\nWe substitute these two expressions into the relation for $K_m(T)$:\n$$ K_m(T) = \\left( K_c(T_0) \\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\Delta H^{\\circ}}{R}\\left(\\frac{1}{T}-\\frac{1}{T_0}\\right)\\right] \\right) \\frac{m^{\\circ}}{c^{\\circ}} \\left( \\rho_0 \\exp\\left[-\\alpha(T-T_0)\\right] \\right) $$\nTo obtain the final expression and make the temperature-dependent density correction explicit, we rearrange the terms by grouping the temperature-independent parts and separating the exponential factors:\n$$ K_m(T) = K_c(T_0) \\frac{m^{\\circ} \\rho_0}{c^{\\circ}} \\exp\\left[-\\frac{\\Delta H^{\\circ}}{R}\\left(\\frac{1}{T}-\\frac{1}{T_0}\\right)\\right] \\exp\\left[-\\alpha(T-T_0)\\right] $$\nThe term $\\exp\\left[-\\alpha(T-T_0)\\right]$ is the explicit correction factor arising solely from the thermal expansion of the solvent. The term $K_c(T_0) \\frac{m^{\\circ} \\rho_0}{c^{\\circ}}$ represents the molality-based equilibrium constant at the reference temperature, $K_m(T_0)$.
