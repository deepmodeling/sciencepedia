Thus, the only physically valid solution is $\\xi_1 = 4/9\\,\\mathrm{mol} \\approx 0.444\\,\\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nThe equilibrium mole fraction of B at State 1 is:\n$y_{\\mathrm{B},1} = \\frac{n_\\mathrm{B,1}}{n_{\\mathrm{tot},1}} = \\frac{\\xi_1}{1.000 - \\xi_1} = \\frac{4/9}{1 - 4/9} = \\frac{4/9}{5/9} = \\frac{4}{5} = 0.800$.\n\n**Part 2: Equilibrium at State 2 ($T_2 = 600\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $P_2 = 20.0\\,\\mathrm{bar}$)**\nFirst, we must calculate the new equilibrium constant $K_p(T_2)$ using the van 't Hoff equation:\n$\\ln\\left(\\frac{K_p(T_2)}{K_p(T_1)}\\right) = -\\frac{\\Delta H^\\circ}{R}\\left(\\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1}\\right)$\nUsing the given values: $\\Delta H^\\circ = -50000\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}$, $R = 8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$, $T_1 = 500\\,\\mathrm{K}$, $T_2 = 600\\,\\mathrm{K}$:\n$\\ln\\left(\\frac{K_p(T_2)}{4.00}\\right) = -\\frac{-50000\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}}}{8.314\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}}\\left(\\frac{1}{600\\,\\mathrm{K}} - \\frac{1}{500\\,\\mathrm{K}}\\right)$\n$\\ln\\left(\\frac{K_p(T_2)}{4.00}\\right) = \\frac{50000}{8.314}\\left(\\frac{5 - 6}{3000}\\right) = \\frac{50000}{8.314}\\left(-\\frac{1}{3000}\\right) = -\\frac{50}{3 \\times 8.314} \\approx -2.0047$\n$K_p(T_2) = 4.00 \\times e^{-2.0047} \\approx 4.00 \\times 0.1347 = 0.5388$\n\nNow we find the new equilibrium composition at $T_2$ and $P_2$. Let $\\xi_2$ be the extent of reaction. The setup is identical in form to State 1.\n$K_p(T_2) = \\frac{\\xi_2(1.000 - \\xi_2)}{(1.000 - 2\\xi_2)^2} \\frac{P^\\circ}{P_2}$\n$0.5388 = \\frac{\\xi_2(1.000 - \\xi_2)}{(1.000 - 2\\xi_2)^2} \\frac{1.00}{20.0}$\n$10.776 = \\frac{\\xi_2 - \\xi_2^2}{1 - 4\\xi_2 + 4\\xi_2^2}$\n$10.776 - 43.104\\xi_2 + 43.104\\xi_2^2 = \\xi_2 - \\xi_2^2$\n$$44.104\\xi_2^2 - 44.104\\xi_2 + 10.776 = 0$$\nSolving for $\\xi_2$:\n$\\xi_2 = \\frac{44.104 \\pm \\sqrt{(-44.104)^2 - 4(44.104)(10.776)}}{2(44.104)} = \\frac{44.104 \\pm \\sqrt{1945.16 - 1900.58}}{88.208} = \\frac{44.104 \\pm \\sqrt{44.58}}{88.208} \\approx \\frac{44.104 \\pm 6.677}{88.208}$\nThe two mathematical solutions are $\\xi_2 \\approx \\frac{50.781}{88.208} \\approx 0.576$ and $\\xi_2 \\approx \\frac{37.427}{88.208} \\approx 0.424$.\nAgain, we require $\\xi_2  0.500$, so the physical solution is $\\xi_2 \\approx 0.424\\,\\mathrm{mol}$.\n\nThe equilibrium mole fraction of B at State 2 is:\n$y_{\\mathrm{B},2} = \\frac{\\xi_2}{1.000 - \\xi_2} = \\frac{0.424}{1.000 - 0.424} = \\frac{0.424}{0.576} \\approx 0.736$.\n\n**Part 3: Comparison and Conclusion**\n- Initial mole fraction: $y_{\\mathrm{B},1} = 0.800$.\n- Final mole fraction: $y_{\\mathrm{B},2} \\approx 0.736 \\approx 0.74$.\n- The mole fraction of B decreases from $0.800$ to approximately $0.74$.\n\nThis result is a consequence of two competing effects described by Le Châtelier's principle. The increase in temperature (from $500\\,\\mathrm{K}$ to $600\\,\\mathrm{K}$) for an exothermic reaction ($\\Delta H^\\circ  0$) shifts the equilibrium to the left, decreasing the amount of product B. The increase in pressure (from $5.00\\,\\mathrm{bar}$ to $20.0\\,\\mathrm{bar}$) for a reaction with a decrease in the number of moles of gas ($\\Delta n_g = 1-2 = -1$) shifts the equilibrium to the right, increasing the amount of product B. The calculation shows that for these specific changes, the temperature effect is dominant, leading to a net decrease in the mole fraction of B.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n- A.
