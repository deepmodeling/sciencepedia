The solute number concentration field is $c(\\mathbf{r},t)$, and the molecular diffusion coefficient is $D$. Far from the particle, the solute concentration is maintained at a constant value $c_{\\infty}$ by a well-stirred reservoir. The particle surface at radius $r=a$ is reactive: upon arrival at the interface, solute molecules undergo a first-order interfacial reaction with intrinsic surface rate constant $k_{s}$ (units of length per time), so that the interfacial reaction rate density is proportional to the local concentration at the surface.\n\nAssume steady state around the isolated particle, negligible convection, and spherical symmetry. Starting from conservation of mass and Fick’s law, formulate the steady diffusion problem in spherical coordinates with appropriate boundary conditions derived by balancing the normal diffusive flux at $r=a$ with the linear surface reaction kinetics.

It is scientifically grounded in Fick's laws of diffusion and first-order reaction kinetics. All necessary parameters and conditions are provided to derive a unique solution. The problem is valid.\n\nThe physical process is governed by the conservation of solute molecules. The continuity equation in the absence of convection is $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} = 0$, where $c(\\mathbf{r},t)$ is the solute concentration and $\\mathbf{J}$ is the diffusive flux. At steady state, $\\frac{\\partial c}{\\partial t} = 0$, which simplifies the continuity equation to $\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{J} = 0$.\n\nAccording to Fick's first law, the diffusive flux is proportional to the concentration gradient: $\\mathbf{J} = -D \\nabla c$, where $D$ is the diffusion coefficient. Substituting Fick's law into the steady-state continuity equation yields the steady-state diffusion equation, which is Laplace's equation for the concentration field:\n$$ -D \\nabla^2 c(\\mathbf{r}) = 0 \\implies \\nabla^2 c(\\mathbf{r}) = 0 $$\nGiven the spherical symmetry of the problem, the concentration $c$ depends only on the radial distance $r$ from the center of the particle, $c=c(r)$. The Laplacian operator in spherical coordinates acting on a function of $r$ only is $\\nabla^2 c(r) = \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r^2 \\frac{dc}{dr}\\right)$. Thus, the governing equation becomes:\n$$ \\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{d}{dr}\\left(r^2 \\frac{dc}{dr}\\right) = 0 $$\nfor $r \\geq a$. Multiplying by $r^2$ and integrating once with respect to $r$ gives:\n$$ r^2 \\frac{dc}{dr} = C_1 $$\nwhere $C_1$ is a constant of integration. Rearranging and integrating a second time yields the general solution for the concentration profile:\n$$ \\frac{dc}{dr} = \\frac{C_1}{r^2} \\implies c(r) = -\\frac{C_1}{r} + C_2 $$\nwhere $C_2$ is a second constant of integration.\n\nThe constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ are determined from the boundary conditions.\nThe first boundary condition is specified far from the particle, where the concentration is maintained at a constant bulk value $c_{\\infty}$:\n$$ c(r) \\to c_{\\infty} \\quad \\text{as} \\quad r \\to \\infty $$\nApplying this condition to the general solution:\n$$ c_{\\infty} = -\\frac{C_1}{\\infty} + C_2 \\implies C_2 = c_{\\infty} $$\nThe concentration profile is therefore $c(r) = c_{\\infty} - \\frac{C_1}{r}$.\n\nThe second boundary condition is at the surface of the reactive particle, $r=a$. Here, the rate of arrival of solute molecules by diffusion must equal the rate of their consumption by the surface reaction. The inward radial diffusive flux density (number of molecules per unit area per unit time) is given by $-J_r = -(-D \\frac{dc}{dr}) = D\\frac{dc}{dr}$. The rate of consumption per unit area by the first-order reaction is given as $k_s c(r=a)$.

The conditional probability density $p(x,t\\,|\\,x_{0})$ for the particle to be at position $x$ at time $t$, given it started at $x_{0}$ at time $t=0$, satisfies the one-dimensional diffusion equation:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p(x,t\\,|\\,x_{0})}{\\partial t} = D \\frac{\\partial^2 p(x,t\\,|\\,x_{0})}{\\partial x^2}\n$$\nThis is the forward Fokker-Planck equation for this system.

The noise $\\eta(t')$ at a future time $t'  0$ is, by the definition of white noise, uncorrelated with its past values. Therefore, $x(0)$ is statistically independent of $\\eta(t')$ for all $t'  0$. This principle is known as causality.\n$$\n\\langle x(0) \\eta(t') \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\langle x(0) \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} \\langle \\eta(t') \\rangle = 0 \\times 0 = 0\n$$\nThe second term in the expression for $\\langle x(t) x(0) \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}}$ vanishes. We are left with:\n$$\n\\langle x(t) x(0) \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} = \\langle x(0)^2 \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} e^{-t/\\tau_R} = \\frac{k_B T}{k} e^{-t/\\tau_R}\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for the MSD:\n$$\n\\langle (\\Delta x(t))^2 \\rangle_{\\mathrm{eq}} = 2 \\frac{k_B T}{k} - 2 \\left( \\frac{k_B T}{k} e^{-t/\\tau_R} \\right) = 2 \\frac{k_B T}{k} \\left( 1 - e^{-t/\\tau_R} \\right)\n$$\nNow, we can assemble the final expression for $F(q,t)$:\n$$\nF(q,t) = \\exp\\left( -\\frac{1}{2} q^2 \\left[ 2 \\frac{k_B T}{k} \\left( 1 - e^{-t/\\tau_R} \\right) \\right] \\right)\n$$\n$$\nF(q,t) = \\exp\\left( - q^2 \\frac{k_B T}{k} \\left( 1 - e^{-t/\\tau_R} \\right) \\right)\n$$\nFinally, substituting the definition of the relaxation time $\\tau_R = \\gamma/k$ back into the expression yields the final answer in terms of the given parameters:\n$$\nF(q,t) = \\exp\\left( - \\frac{q^2 k_B T}{k} \\left( 1 - e^{-kt/\\gamma} \\right) \\right)\n$$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\exp\\left(-\\frac{q^{2} k_{B} T}{k} \\left(1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{kt}{\\gamma}\\right)\\right)\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2907882"}]}
