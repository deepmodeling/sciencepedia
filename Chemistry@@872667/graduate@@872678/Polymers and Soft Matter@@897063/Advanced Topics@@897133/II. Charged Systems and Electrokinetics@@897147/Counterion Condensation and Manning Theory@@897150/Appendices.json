The constraint $\\xi > 1/z$ is the standard Manning criterion for the onset of counterion condensation, suggesting the problem is self-consistent.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A rigorous solution will be derived.\n\nThe derivation begins from fundamental electrostatic principles within the Poisson-Boltzmann framework.\nIn cylindrical coordinates, the radial component of the electric field $E(r)$ is related to the electrostatic potential $\\psi(r)$ by $E(r) = - \\dfrac{d\\psi}{dr}$.\nAccording to Gauss's law, the electric field at a radial distance $r$ from the axis of the cylinder is determined by the total enclosed line charge density. The total charge per unit length within a cylinder of radius $r$ is the sum of the rod's charge and the charge of the counterions in the volume between radius $a$ and $r$.\nThe charge per unit length of the rod is $\\lambda = -|\\lambda|$. The charge per unit length from the counterions is $z e N(r)$.\nThus, Gauss's law states:\n$$ (2 \\pi r) E(r) = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} \\left( \\lambda + z e N(r) \\right) $$\nSubstituting the definitions of $E(r)$, $\\lambda$, and the neutralization fraction $\\theta(r) \\equiv \\dfrac{z e N(r)}{|\\lambda|}$:\n$$ -2 \\pi r \\frac{d\\psi}{dr} = \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon} \\left( -|\\lambda| + |\\lambda| \\theta(r) \\right) = -\\frac{|\\lambda|}{\\varepsilon} \\left( 1 - \\theta(r) \\right) $$\nThis yields an expression for the potential gradient:\n$$ \\frac{d\\psi}{dr} = \\frac{|\\lambda|}{2 \\pi \\varepsilon r} \\left( 1 - \\theta(r) \\right) $$\nThe problem is formulated in terms of the logarithmic coordinate $s = \\ln(r/a)$, so we perform a change of variables.

Let us analyze the factor $\\dfrac{d\\theta}{ds}$. From its definition, $\\dfrac{d\\theta}{dr} = \\dfrac{2 \\pi z e}{|\\lambda|} r n(r)$. Since the ion density $n(r)$ must be positive definite for any finite $r$, and $r > a > 0$, it follows that $\\dfrac{d\\theta}{dr} > 0$. Consequently, $\\dfrac{d\\theta}{ds} = r \\dfrac{d\\theta}{dr} > 0$. The neutralization fraction $\\theta(s)$ is a strictly monotonically increasing function of $s$.\nTherefore, the term $\\dfrac{d\\theta}{ds}\\bigg|_{s=s_c}$ cannot be zero. The condition for the inflection point must be satisfied by the other factor:\n$$ 2 - 2 z \\xi \\left(1 - \\theta(s_c)\\right) = 0 $$\nThe problem defines the condensed fraction as $f_c \\equiv \\theta(s_c)$. Substituting this into the equation:\n$$ 2 - 2 z \\xi \\left(1 - f_c\\right) = 0 $$\nThis is a simple algebraic equation for $f_c$.\n$$ 1 - z \\xi \\left(1 - f_c\\right) = 0 $$\n$$ 1 = z \\xi (1 - f_c) $$\n$$ \\frac{1}{z \\xi} = 1 - f_c $$\nSolving for $f_c$ yields the final expression:\n$$ f_c = 1 - \\frac{1}{z \\xi} $$\nThe problem states that $\\xi > 1/z$, which ensures that $z\\xi > 1$.

According to Manning's theory for the strong-coupling regime ($\\xi > 1$), counterions condense until $\\lambda_{\\text{eff}}$ is reduced to a critical value, which is precisely $-e/l_B$.\n$$\n\\lambda_{\\text{eff}} = -\\frac{e}{l_B}\n$$\nSubstituting the expressions for the charge densities into this condition:\n$$\n-\\frac{e \\xi}{l_B} + e(n_1 + 2n_2) = -\\frac{e}{l_B}\n$$\nDividing by the elementary charge $e$ and rearranging gives the total amount of positive charge (in units of elementary charge per unit length) that must be condensed:\n$$\nn_1 + 2n_2 = \\frac{\\xi}{l_B} - \\frac{1}{l_B} = \\frac{\\xi - 1}{l_B}\n$$\nThis fundamental equation quantifies the total charge neutralization required. The quantity $X$, the fraction of the total positive charge in the condensed layer carried by divalent ions, is defined as:\n$$\nX \\equiv \\frac{2 n_2}{n_1 + 2 n_2}\n$$\nUsing the charge-renormalization result, the denominator is simply $(\\xi-1)/l_B$.\n\nOur task now is to eliminate the unknown potential $\\tilde{\\psi}$ and find an expression for $X$. Let us define a variable $Y \\equiv \\exp(-\\tilde{\\psi})$. Since $\\psi_0$ is the potential experienced by positive counterions near a negative rod, $\\psi_0  0$, which implies $\\tilde{\\psi}  0$ and $Y > 1$. The relations for $n_1$ and $n_2$ become:\n$$\nn_1 = c_1 A_1 Y\n$$\n$$\nn_2 = c_2 A_2 Y^2\n$$\nSubstituting these into the charge-neutralization equation:\n$$\nc_1 A_1 Y + 2 c_2 A_2 Y^2 = \\frac{\\xi - 1}{l_B}\n$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $Y$:\n$$\n(2 c_2 A_2) Y^2 + (c_1 A_1) Y - \\left(\\frac{\\xi - 1}{l_B}\\right) = 0\n$$\nWe solve for $Y$ using the quadratic formula, keeping only the positive root, as $Y = \\exp(-\\tilde{\\psi})$ must be positive.\n$$\nY = \\frac{-(c_1 A_1) + \\sqrt{(c_1 A_1)^2 - 4(2 c_2 A_2)\\left(-\\frac{\\xi - 1}{l_B}\\right)}}{2(2 c_2 A_2)}\n$$\n$$\nY = \\frac{-c_1 A_1 + \\sqrt{(c_1 A_1)^2 + \\frac{8 c_2 A_2 (\\xi - 1)}{l_B}}}{4 c_2 A_2}\n$$\nNow, let us express $X$ in terms of $Y$:\n$$\nX = \\frac{2 n_2}{n_1 + 2 n_2} = \\frac{2 (c_2 A_2 Y^2)}{c_1 A_1 Y + 2 c_2 A_2 Y^2}\n$$\nFor $Y \\neq 0$, we can divide the numerator and denominator by $Y$:\n$$\nX = \\frac{2 c_2 A_2 Y}{c_1 A_1 + 2 c_2 A_2 Y}\n$$\nTo simplify the final expression, let us substitute the solution for $Y$. The numerator term is:\n$$\n2 c_2 A_2 Y = 2 c_2 A_2 \\left( \\frac{-c_1 A_1 + \\sqrt{(c_1 A_1)^2 + \\frac{8 c_2 A_2 (\\xi - 1)}{l_B}}}{4 c_2 A_2} \\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(-c_1 A_1 + \\sqrt{(c_1 A_1)^2 + \\frac{8 c_2 A_2 (\\xi - 1)}{l_B}}\\right)\n$$\nThe denominator term is $c_1 A_1 + 2 c_2 A_2 Y$:\n$$\nc_1 A_1 + \\frac{1}{2}\\left(-c_1 A_1 + \\sqrt{(c_1 A_1)^2 + \\frac{8 c_2 A_2 (\\xi - 1)}{l_B}}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(2 c_1 A_1 - c_1 A_1 + \\sqrt{(c_1 A_1)^2 + \\frac{8 c_2 A_2 (\\xi - 1)}{l_B}}\\right)\n$$\n$$\n= \\frac{1}{2}\\left(c_1 A_1 + \\sqrt{(c_1 A_1)^2 + \\frac{8 c_2 A_2 (\\xi - 1)}{l_B}}\\right)\n$$\nFinally, taking the ratio of these two expressions to find $X$:\n$$\nX = \\frac{\\frac{1}{2}\\left(-c_1 A_1 + \\sqrt{(c_1 A_1)^2 + \\frac{8 c_2 A_2 (\\xi - 1)}{l_B}}\\right)}{\\frac{1}{2}\\left(c_1 A_1 + \\sqrt{(c_1 A_1)^2 + \\frac{8 c_2 A_2 (\\xi - 1)}{l_B}}\\right)}\n$$\nThe factor of $1/2$ cancels, yielding the final closed-form expression for $X$:\n$$\nX = \\frac{-c_1 A_1 + \\sqrt{(c_1 A_1)^2 + \\frac{8 c_2 A_2 (\\xi - 1)}{l_B}}}{c_1 A_1 + \\sqrt{(c_1 A_1)^2 + \\frac{8 c_2 A_2 (\\xi - 1)}{l_B}}}\n$$\nThis expression depends only on the parameters given in the problem statement, as required.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{-c_1 A_1 + \\sqrt{(c_1 A_1)^2 + \\frac{8 c_2 A_2 (\\xi - 1)}{l_B}}}{c_1 A_1 + \\sqrt{(c_1 A_1)^2 + \\frac{8 c_2 A_2 (\\xi - 1)}{l_B}}}}\n$$", "id": "2911260"}]}
