The energy of a segment oriented at an angle $\\theta$ with respect to the applied force $f$ is given as $E(\\theta) = -f b \\cos\\theta$. According to the Boltzmann distribution, the probability of finding the segment in a particular orientation is proportional to the Boltzmann factor, $\\exp(-E(\\theta)/(k_B T))$.\n\nThe partition function, $z$, for a single segment is obtained by integrating this Boltzmann factor over all possible spatial orientations.

For the integral over $\\theta$, a substitution is made: let $u = \\cos\\theta$, which means $du = -\\sin\\theta \\, d\\theta$.

In statistical mechanics, the expectation value of an observable can be calculated from the partition function. Specifically, for an observable coupled linearly to a force in the energy term, its expectation value can be found by differentiation. The contribution to energy is $-f x$ where $x = b\\cos\\theta$.

The total mean end-to-end extension of the chain, $X$, is simply the sum of the average extensions of all segments:\n$$ X = N \\langle x \\rangle $$\nWe are given the contour length $L_c = N b$, which implies $N = L_c / b$.

It addresses the canonical worm-like chain (WLC) model, a cornerstone of polymer physics, to describe the force-extension properties of a semi-flexible polymer such as double-stranded DNA. The problem provides a valid energy functional and asks for the derivation of its known asymptotic behaviors and the application of a standard interpolation formula. All provided parameters are physically realistic for a single-molecule experiment. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem begins with the elastic energy functional for a WLC of contour length $L_c$ and bending rigidity $\\kappa$ under an external stretching force $f$:\n$$ E[\\mathbf{t}] = \\frac{\\kappa}{2} \\int_{0}^{L_{c}} \\left|\\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{t}}{\\partial s}\\right|^{2} \\mathrm{d}s - f \\int_{0}^{L_{c}} t_{z}(s)\\,\\mathrm{d}s $$\nHere, $\\mathbf{t}(s)$ is the unit tangent vector at arc length $s$, and $t_z$ is its component along the direction of the force. The rigidity $\\kappa$ is related to the persistence length $L_p$ and thermal energy $k_B T$ by $\\kappa = k_B T L_p$.\n\nFirst, we analyze the low-force limit ($f \\to 0$). In this regime, the polymer behaves as a random coil on length scales much larger than $L_p$. The appropriate description is that of a freely-jointed chain composed of segments of the Kuhn length, $L_k = 2L_p$. The mean-squared end-to-end distance in the absence of force, for a long chain ($L_c \\gg L_p$), is $\\langle R^2 \\rangle_0 \\approx 2 L_p L_c$. Due to isotropy, the mean-squared projection onto the $z$-axis is $\\langle R_z^2 \\rangle_0 = \\frac{1}{3} \\langle R^2 \\rangle_0 = \\frac{2}{3} L_p L_c$.\nFrom linear response theory in statistical mechanics, the average extension $\\langle x \\rangle$ induced by a small force $f$ is:\n$$ \\langle x \\rangle = \\frac{f}{k_B T} \\langle R_z^2 \\rangle_0 = \\frac{f}{k_B T} \\left( \\frac{2}{3} L_p L_c \\right) $$\nThe dimensionless extension is defined as $z \\equiv \\langle x \\rangle / L_c$. This gives the linear response:\n$$ z = \\frac{2 L_p f}{3 k_B T} $$\nThis demonstrates that $z \\propto f$ in the low-force limit. The force-extension relation is therefore $f(z) = \\frac{3 k_B T}{2 L_p} z$, which is the entropic analogue of Hooke's Law for a polymer chain, consistent with the Kuhn-length identification.\n\nNext, we analyze the high-force limit ($f \\to \\infty$), which corresponds to the extension approaching the contour length ($z \\to 1$). Here, the chain is highly aligned with the force, and its conformation is dominated by small transverse fluctuations, $\\mathbf{t}_{\\perp}(s)$. The tangent's projection can be approximated as $t_z = \\sqrt{1 - |\\mathbf{t}_{\\perp}|^2} \\approx 1 - \\frac{1}{2}|\\mathbf{t}_{\\perp}|^2$.

Applying the equipartition theorem, where each quadratic degree of freedom contributes $\\frac{1}{2} k_B T$ to the average energy, allows for the calculation of the average squared amplitude of these fluctuations. The result, derived by summing over all fluctuation modes, connects the extension to the applied force:\n$$ 1-z = \\frac{k_B T}{2\\sqrt{\\kappa f}} $$\nSubstituting $\\kappa = k_B T L_p$ and solving for $f$:\n$$ f(z) \\approx \\frac{k_B T}{4 L_p (1-z)^2} $$\nThis expression shows the inverse-square divergence of the force as $z \\to 1$.

This is a classic signature of a single polymer tether being stretched almost to its full length before the bond at its end—the specific ligand-receptor bond—ruptures. The definitive proof of specificity comes from the competition assay: the addition of free soluble ligand at $10\\,\\mu\\mathrm{M}$ eliminates these events. The free ligands in solution bind to the surface receptors, blocking them and thus preventing the tip-tethered ligand from binding.\n2.  **Short-rupture events**: These occur at very short tip-sample separations ($< 5\\,\\mathrm{nm}$), persist after the addition of free ligand, and are modulated by changes in ionic strength, addition of surfactant, and surface passivation. This collection of characteristics identifies them as nonspecific adhesion, or \"sticking,\" between the AFM tip assembly and the substrate.\n\nNow, we evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. In SMFS, nonspecific adhesion refers to tip–sample interactions not mediated by the intended ligand–receptor pair, arising from generic forces such as electrostatic attraction, hydrophobic interactions, van der Waals dispersion, and hydrogen bonding; screening electrolytes can suppress the electrostatic component, nonionic surfactants can suppress hydrophobic adhesion, and PEG passivation reduces residual sticking by steric exclusion.**\nThis statement provides a correct and comprehensive definition of nonspecific adhesion in the context of SMFS. It correctly identifies the primary physical origins of such forces. Furthermore, it accurately describes the standard mitigation strategies and their underlying physical mechanisms. Screening electrolytes (like the phosphate buffer at higher ionic strength) reduce the range of electrostatic forces. Nonionic surfactants (like Tween-$20$) adsorb to surfaces and reduce nonspecific adhesion arising from hydrophobic effects. A polymer brush (like PEG) grafted onto the substrate creates a steric barrier that physically prevents the tip from making close contact with the surface, thereby reducing all forms of short-range adhesion. All parts of this statement are physically correct and consistent with experimental practice.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. Because increasing ionic strength reduces the Debye screening length and therefore attenuates long-range electrostatic interactions, the observed decrease in short-rupture adhesion when $I$ increases from $10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ to $150\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ implicates an electrostatic attractive contribution to nonspecific adhesion.**\nThe Debye length, $\\kappa^{-1}$, which characterizes the decay length of the electrostatic potential in an electrolyte solution, is inversely proportional to the square root of the ionic strength $I$: $\\kappa^{-1} \\propto I^{-1/2}$. Increasing $I$ from $10\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ to $150\\,\\mathrm{mM}$ significantly decreases $\\kappa^{-1}$, leading to more effective screening of electrostatic interactions. The experiment shows that this increase in screening causes a drop in the probability of short-rupture (nonspecific) events. If reducing an interaction leads to less adhesion, the interaction must have been attractive. Therefore, the observation correctly implicates an attractive electrostatic force as a component of the nonspecific adhesion.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. Hydrophobic interactions are strengthened by adding a nonionic surfactant; therefore, the observed decrease in adhesion upon adding $0.01\\,\\%$ Tween-$20$ indicates that specific ligand–receptor bonds, not nonspecific adhesion, were being removed.**\nThis statement is founded on a false premise. Nonionic surfactants such as Tween-$20$ are amphiphilic molecules used precisely because they *reduce* or *suppress* hydrophobic interactions. They adsorb at hydrophobic interfaces, presenting their hydrophilic head groups to the aqueous phase, thereby passivating the surface against hydrophobic aggregation. The observation that adhesion decreases upon adding Tween-$20$ is direct evidence that hydrophobic interactions contribute to the adhesion. Since it is the short-rupture events that are affected, this confirms a hydrophobic component to the nonspecific adhesion. The conclusion drawn in the statement is incorrect because the premise is false.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. Rupture events that occur at extensions approaching the PEG contour length and that disappear upon addition of free ligand are diagnostic of specific binding, whereas nonspecific adhesion typically manifests as near-contact detachments at short separations with broad, context-dependent force distributions.**\nThis statement correctly summarizes the key diagnostic criteria used to distinguish specific from nonspecific events in SMFS. The rupture location (extension) is a primary indicator: extension close to the linker's contour length points to the unfolding of the tether, a hallmark of a single specific bond. The competition assay (disappearance upon adding free ligand) is the chemical \"gold standard\" for confirming specificity. Conversely, nonspecific adhesion is characterized by its short-range nature (near-contact detachment) and often a lack of a well-defined rupture force, reflecting the heterogeneous and multi-faceted nature of surface sticking. The statement accurately reflects the interpretation of the experimental data presented.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. Van der Waals dispersion forces are dominant at separations $> 50\\,\\mathrm{nm}$; hence, the near-contact short-rupture events cannot originate from van der Waals interactions and must be specific bonds.**\nThis statement contains a fundamental error regarding the range of intermolecular forces. Van der Waals forces between macroscopic bodies are extremely short-ranged, typically decaying with distance $d$ as $d^{-n}$ where $n$ is large (e.g., $d^{-2}$ for parallel plates, $d^{-7}$ for interaction between an atom and a surface). They are significant only at separations of a few nanometers at most. At separations $> 50\\,\\mathrm{nm}$, they are utterly negligible compared to unscreened electrostatic forces. The premise that van der Waals forces are dominant at long range is false. Consequently, the conclusion is invalid. Van der Waals forces are, in fact, a prime candidate for contributing to *near-contact* nonspecific adhesion, contrary to the statement's claim.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\nIn summary, statements A, B, and D are scientifically correct and accurately interpret the provided experimental results. Statements C and E are based on incorrect physical principles.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABD}$$", "id": "2786641"}]}
