Therefore, the problem is valid, and a rigorous solution can be constructed.\n\nThe analysis proceeds in three parts as requested. First, we will derive the expected bias of the naive Mean Squared Displacement (MSD) estimator. Second, we will outline a corrected reconstruction strategy using the available hardware timestamps. Third, we will identify the leading-order contribution of timestamp jitter to the variance of an estimator based on linear interpolation.\n\nLet us begin with the analysis of the naive estimator's bias. The problem defines the naive time-averaged MSD estimator at an $m$-step lag as:\n$$ \\widehat{\\mathrm{MSD}}_{\\mathrm{naive}}(m)=\\frac{1}{N-m}\\sum_{i=0}^{N-m-1}\\left[x(t_{i+m})-x(t_{i})\\right]^{2} $$\nWe are asked to find the expected value of this estimator, $\\mathbb{E}[\\widehat{\\mathrm{MSD}}_{\\mathrm{naive}}(m)]$.

Therefore, each term in the sum has the same expectation. We can analyze a single representative term, for example, with $i=0$: $\\mathbb{E}[(x(t_m)-x(t_0))^2]$.\n\nThe particle displacement $x(t)$ is a Gaussian process with stationary and independent increments. The theoretical MSD for a time interval $\\tau$ is given as $\\mathrm{MSD}(\\tau) = 2D\\tau$. The time lag between the $m$-th and the $0$-th observed frames, $\\tau_{0,m} = t_m - t_0$, is a random variable. The tracer motion is independent of the acquisition process. We can therefore use the law of total expectation, conditioning on the value of the random time lag $\\tau_{0,m}$:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(x(t_m)-x(t_0)\\right)^{2}\\right] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(x(t_m)-x(t_0)\\right)^{2} | \\tau_{0,m}\\right]\\right] $$\nThe inner expectation is simply the MSD evaluated at the specific time lag $\\tau_{0,m}$:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(x(t_m)-x(t_0)\\right)^{2} | \\tau_{0,m}\\right] = \\mathrm{MSD}(\\tau_{0,m}) = 2D\\tau_{0,m} $$\nSubstituting this back, we find that the expected squared displacement is proportional to the expected time lag:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(x(t_m)-x(t_0)\\right)^{2}\\right] = \\mathbb{E}[2D\\tau_{0,m}] = 2D\\mathbb{E}[\\tau_{0,m}] $$\nThe problem now reduces to computing the expected time lag, $\\mathbb{E}[\\tau_{0,m}] = \\mathbb{E}[t_m-t_0]$. The total time lag is the sum of $m$ consecutive inter-observation intervals, $W_j = t_{j+1} - t_j$:\n$$ t_m - t_0 = \\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} W_j $$\nThe inter-observation intervals $\\{W_j\\}$ are independent and identically distributed random variables. Thus, the expectation of the sum is the sum of expectations:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[t_m - t_0] = \\sum_{j=0}^{m-1} \\mathbb{E}[W_j] = m\\mathbb{E}[W_0] $$\nWe now compute the expected duration of a single inter-observation interval, $\\mathbb{E}[W]$. The interval $W$ is defined as $W = \\sum_{r=1}^{K} (\\Delta + \\varepsilon_r)$, where $K$ is the number of nominal periods, distributed as $K \\sim \\mathrm{Geom}(q)$ on $\\{1, 2, \\dots\\}$, and the $\\{\\varepsilon_r\\}$ are i.i.d. Gaussian jitters with $\\mathbb{E}[\\varepsilon_r]=0$. We again apply the law of total expectation, conditioning on the value of $K$:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[W] = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathbb{E}[W|K]] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{r=1}^{K} (\\Delta + \\varepsilon_r) \\Bigg| K \\right]\\right] $$\nGiven $K=k$, the inner expectation is:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[W|K=k] = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{r=1}^{k} (\\Delta + \\varepsilon_r)\\right] = \\sum_{r=1}^{k} \\mathbb{E}[\\Delta + \\varepsilon_r] = \\sum_{r=1}^{k} (\\Delta + 0) = k\\Delta $$\nThe timestamp jitter does not affect the expected duration of the interval because it has zero mean. Now, we average over the distribution of $K$:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[W] = \\mathbb{E}[K\\Delta] = \\Delta\\mathbb{E}[K] $$\nThe random variable $K$ follows a geometric distribution on $\\{1, 2, \\dots\\}$ with success probability $q=1-p$. Its probability mass function is $P(K=k) = (1-q)^{k-1}q = p^{k-1}(1-p)$. The expectation of this distribution is a standard result: $\\mathbb{E}[K] = 1/q$.\nTherefore, the expected inter-observation interval is:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[W] = \\frac{\\Delta}{q} = \\frac{\\Delta}{1-p} $$\nSubstituting this back, we find the expected total lag time for an $m$-step displacement:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[t_m - t_0] = m \\frac{\\Delta}{1-p} $$\nFinally, the expectation of the naive MSD estimator is:\n$$ \\mathbb{E}[\\widehat{\\mathrm{MSD}}_{\\mathrm{naive}}(m)] = 2D \\left(m \\frac{\\Delta}{1-p}\\right) = \\frac{2Dm\\Delta}{1-p} $$\nThe user of this estimator incorrectly interprets it as an estimate of $\\mathrm{MSD}(m\\Delta) = 2Dm\\Delta$. The multiplicative bias factor $B(p)$ is the ratio of the actual expected value to the naively assumed value:\n$$ B(p) = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[\\widehat{\\mathrm{MSD}}_{\\mathrm{naive}}(m)]}{\\mathrm{MSD}(m\\Delta)} = \\frac{\\frac{2Dm\\Delta}{1-p}}{2Dm\\Delta} = \\frac{1}{1-p} $$\n\nNext, we outline a reconstruction strategy to obtain an unbiased MSD estimate. The fundamental flaw of the naive estimator is that it uses the lag index $m$ as a proxy for the physical time lag, assuming it to be $m\\Delta$. The correct approach must utilize the hardware timestamps $\\{t_i\\}$ to compute the true physical time lags. A standard and robust method is as follows:\n1. For all available pairs of observations $(i, j)$ with $j>i$, calculate the squared displacement $(x(t_j)-x(t_i))^2$ and the true time lag $\\tau_{ij} = t_j - t_i$.\n2. Define a grid of desired lag times $\\{\\tau_{\\ell}\\}$ with corresponding bin widths $\\{\\delta\\tau_{\\ell}\\}$.\n3. For each target lag $\\tau_{\\ell}$, collect all pairs $(i, j)$ for which the time lag $\\tau_{ij}$ falls within the bin $[\\tau_{\\ell} - \\delta\\tau_{\\ell}/2, \\tau_{\\ell} + \\delta\\tau_{\\ell}/2]$.\n4. The MSD estimate for $\\tau_{\\ell}$ is the average of the squared displacements for all pairs in that bin.\nThis method, often called the \"lag-time binned\" MSD, directly accounts for the irregular time spacing and provides an approximately unbiased estimate, provided the bins are sufficiently narrow.\nAn alternative strategy mentioned is interpolation. One would first construct a regular time grid $\\{T_k = k\\Delta T\\}$ and then use linear interpolation between the observed data points $(t_i, x(t_i))$ to estimate the trajectory positions $\\{x(T_k)\\}$ on this grid. A standard MSD algorithm can then be applied to the resampled, regularly spaced data. This method, however, introduces its own systematic errors (bias) and statistical noise (variance).\n\nFinally, we identify the role of timestamp jitter in the variance of the estimator derived from the linear interpolation method. The core idea is to trace how the variance of the jitter, $\\sigma_t^2$, propagates through the system.\n1. The timestamp jitter $\\{\\varepsilon_{i,r}\\}$ on the nominal periods directly contributes to the variance of the inter-observation intervals $W_i$. Using the law of total variance, we find $\\mathrm{Var}(W_i) = \\mathbb{E}[\\mathrm{Var}(W_i|K_i)] + \\mathrm{Var}(\\mathbb{E}[W_i|K_i])$. The first term is $\\mathbb{E}[K_i \\sigma_t^2] = \\sigma_t^2 \\mathbb{E}[K_i] = \\sigma_t^2/q$. Therefore, $\\mathrm{Var}(W_i)$ contains an additive contribution from jitter, $\\sigma_t^2/(1-p)$.\n2. The linear interpolation algorithm estimates a point $x(T_j)$ lying in an interval $[t_i, t_{i+1}]$ of length $W_i = t_{i+1}-t_i$. The error of this interpolation, $e(T_j) = \\hat{x}(T_j) - x(T_j)$, is a Brownian bridge process.\n3. The variance of this interpolation error depends directly on the length of the interval, $W_i$. For example, the average variance of the error over the interval is proportional to $W_i$, i.e., $\\mathbb{E}_{T_j \\in [t_i, t_{i+1}]}[\\mathrm{Var}(e(T_j))] = DW_i/3$.\n4. The final MSD estimate is calculated from these interpolated positions, which are noisy. The variance of the MSD estimator is therefore increased by the variance of the interpolation errors. Since the interpolation error variance is a function of the random variable $W_i$, the variance of the final estimator will depend on the statistical moments of $W_i$, including its variance, $\\mathrm{Var}(W_i)$.\n5. To leading order, the timestamp jitter $\\sigma_t^2$ increases $\\mathrm{Var}(W_i)$, which in turn increases the magnitude and variability of the interpolation error. This added noise in the resampled positions propagates to the final calculation of the MSD, increasing the variance of the estimator. Therefore, the timestamp jitter introduces a contribution to the total estimator variance that is proportional to $\\sigma_t^2$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{1-p}}$$", "id": "2921269"}, {"introduction": "Beyond measuring bulk fluid properties, particle tracking is a powerful tool for probing the microscopic mechanical environment within a complex material.

So we integrate over $s$ from $-\\infty$ to $0$:\n$$C_x(\\Delta t) = \\frac{2k_B T}{\\gamma} \\int_{-\\infty}^{0} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t-2s}{\\tau_k}\\right) ds = \\frac{2k_B T}{\\gamma} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_k}\\right) \\left[ \\frac{\\tau_k}{2} \\exp\\left(\\frac{2s}{\\tau_k}\\right) \\right]_{-\\infty}^0$$\n$$C_x(\\Delta t) = \\frac{k_B T \\tau_k}{\\gamma} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_k}\\right) = \\frac{k_B T (\\gamma/k)}{\\gamma} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_k}\\right) = \\frac{k_B T}{k} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_k}\\right)$$\nSubstituting $\\langle x^2 \\rangle_{eq}$ and $C_x(\\Delta t)$ into the MSD expression:\n$$\\text{MSD}_x(\\Delta t) = 2\\left[ \\frac{k_B T}{k} - \\frac{k_B T}{k}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\tau_k}\\right) \\right] = \\frac{2k_B T}{k}\\left[1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\gamma/k}\\right)\\right]$$\nThe problem specifies an isotropic potential, so the motion in the $y$ direction is independent and identical to the motion in $x$. Thus, $\\text{MSD}_y(\\Delta t) = \\text{MSD}_x(\\Delta t)$. The two-dimensional MSD is the sum:\n$$\\text{MSD}_{2D}(\\Delta t) = \\text{MSD}_x(\\Delta t) + \\text{MSD}_y(\\Delta t) = 2 \\times \\text{MSD}_x(\\Delta t)$$\n$$\\text{MSD}_{2D}(\\Delta t) = \\frac{4k_B T}{k}\\left[1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k\\Delta t}{\\gamma}\\right)\\right]$$\nThis completes the derivation of the two-dimensional MSD as a function of lag time.\n\nThe second part of the problem requires its long-time plateau value. This is found by taking the limit as $\\Delta t \\to \\infty$:\n$$\\text{MSD}_{2D, \\text{plateau}} = \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to \\infty} \\text{MSD}_{2D}(\\Delta t) = \\lim_{\\Delta t \\to \\infty} \\frac{4k_B T}{k}\\left[1 - \\exp\\left(-\\frac{k\\Delta t}{\\gamma}\\right)\\right]$$\nSince $k > 0$ and $\\gamma > 0$, the exponential term decays to zero. The plateau value is therefore:\n$$\\text{MSD}_{2D, \\text{plateau}} = \\frac{4k_B T}{k}$$\nThis is the desired relation. We can see that the plateau value depends only on thermal energy and trap stiffness, and is independent of the fluid viscosity $\\gamma$. This is expected, as the long-time limit reflects the equilibrium statistical properties of the system.\n\nFinally, we compute the in-plane spring constant $k$ using the provided experimental data. We rearrange the plateau relation to solve for $k$:\n$$k = \\frac{4k_B T}{\\text{MSD}_{2D, \\text{plateau}}}$$\nThe given values are:\nTemperature $T = 298 \\ \\mathrm{K}$.\nBoltzmann constant $k_B = 1.380649 \\times 10^{-23} \\ \\mathrm{J/K}$.\nPlateau MSD $\\text{MSD}_{2D, \\text{plateau}} = 0.082 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}^2$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the numerator, $4k_B T$:\n$$4k_B T = 4 \\times (1.380649 \\times 10^{-23} \\ \\mathrm{J/K}) \\times (298 \\ \\mathrm{K}) \\approx 1.64573 \\times 10^{-20} \\ \\mathrm{J}$$\nNow, we substitute the values into the expression for $k$:\n$$k = \\frac{1.64573 \\times 10^{-20} \\ \\mathrm{J}}{0.082 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}^2}$$\nTo obtain the final answer in units of $\\mathrm{pN}/\\mu\\mathrm{m}$, we use the conversion factor $1 \\ \\mathrm{pN} \\cdot \\mu\\mathrm{m} = 10^{-18} \\ \\mathrm{J}$, which implies $1 \\ \\mathrm{J} = 10^{18} \\ \\mathrm{pN} \\cdot \\mu\\mathrm{m}$.\n$$k = \\frac{1.64573 \\times 10^{-20} \\times 10^{18} \\ \\mathrm{pN} \\cdot \\mu\\mathrm{m}}{0.082 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}^2} = \\frac{1.64573 \\times 10^{-2} \\ \\mathrm{pN} \\cdot \\mu\\mathrm{m}}{0.082 \\ \\mu\\mathrm{m}^2}$$\n$$k = \\frac{0.0164573}{0.082} \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{pN}}{\\mu\\mathrm{m}} \\approx 0.200699 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{pN}}{\\mu\\mathrm{m}}$$\nRounding to four significant figures as required by the problem statement, we obtain the final numerical value for the spring constant.\n$$k \\approx 0.2007 \\ \\frac{\\mathrm{pN}}{\\mu\\mathrm{m}}$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.2007}$$", "id": "2921317"}]}
