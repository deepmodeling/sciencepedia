Mastering this derivation [@problem_id:2906697] provides a first-principles understanding of how microscopic persistence gives rise to the characteristic ballistic-to-diffusive crossover, the defining statistical signature of active motion.", "problem": "Consider a single self-propelled particle in a $d$-dimensional isotropic fluid medium at constant temperature, modeled in two different ways: as an active Brownian particle (ABP) and as a run-and-tumble particle (RTP). In both models, the particle position $\\mathbf{r}(t)$ evolves according to the overdamped kinematics $d\\mathbf{r}/dt = \\mathbf{v}(t) + \\sqrt{2 D_t}\\,\\boldsymbol{\\xi}(t)$, where $\\mathbf{v}(t) = v_0 \\mathbf{n}(t)$ with constant self-propulsion speed $v_0$, $D_t$ is the translational diffusivity, and $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}(t)$ is zero-mean Gaussian white noise with unit variance and uncorrelated with $\\mathbf{n}(t)$. The unit vector $\\mathbf{n}(t)$ is the instantaneous orientation of the self-propulsion. For the ABP, $\\mathbf{n}(t)$ undergoes isotropic rotational diffusion on the unit $(d-1)$-sphere with rotational diffusion coefficient $D_r$. For the RTP, $\\mathbf{n}(t)$ is piecewise constant between instantaneous tumbles that occur as a Poisson process of rate $\\alpha$; each tumble resets $\\mathbf{n}(t)$ to an isotropically distributed direction, independent of its previous value.\n\nUsing only fundamental definitions and first principles (e.g., time integration of velocity, stationarity and isotropy, and the relation between the mean-squared displacement and the velocity autocorrelation), perform the following tasks:\n\n1. Starting from $\\Delta \\mathbf{r}(t) = \\int_0^t \\mathbf{v}(s)\\,ds + \\text{thermal contribution}$, derive an exact expression for the mean-squared displacement $\\langle |\\Delta \\mathbf{r}(t)|^2 \\rangle$ in terms of the orientation autocorrelation function $C_n(t) = \\langle \\mathbf{n}(t)\\cdot \\mathbf{n}(0)\\rangle$.\n2. For the ABP, show that $C_n(t)$ is a single exponential in time with a decorrelation rate that depends on $d$ and $D_r$, and use this result to obtain the active contribution to the long-time diffusivity, denoted $D_a^{\\mathrm{ABP}}$.\n3. For the RTP, compute $C_n(t)$ and the corresponding active contribution to the long-time diffusivity, denoted $D_a^{\\mathrm{RTP}}$.\n4. Define the ballistic-to-diffusive crossover time $t_c$ as the unique positive time at which the leading-order short-time ballistic contribution from self-propulsion, $v_0^2 t^2$, equals twice the leading-order long-time diffusive contribution from self-propulsion alone, that is,\n$$\nv_0^2 t_c^2 = 2 d\\, D_a\\, t_c,\n$$\nwhere $D_a$ is the active contribution to the long-time diffusivity for the model under consideration. Using this operational definition, obtain closed-form expressions for $t_c^{\\mathrm{ABP}}$ and $t_c^{\\mathrm{RTP}}$ in terms of $d$, $D_r$, and $\\alpha$.\n5.

The mathematical framework used is that of stochastic differential equations (Langevin equations), which is standard in statistical mechanics. The problem is free of pseudoscience and factual error.\n- **Well-Posed and Objective**: The problem provides all necessary definitions, constants, and model descriptions. The tasks are clearly stated and lead to a unique, meaningful solution based on established physical principles. The language is precise and objective.\n- **Completeness**: The problem is self-contained and does not suffer from missing or contradictory information.\n\nThe verdict is that the problem is valid. We may proceed to a solution.\n\nThe displacement of the particle over a time interval $t$ is given by integrating the equation of motion:\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathbf{r}(t) = \\mathbf{r}(t) - \\mathbf{r}(0) = \\int_0^t \\left( v_0 \\mathbf{n}(s) + \\sqrt{2 D_t} \\boldsymbol{\\xi}(s) \\right) ds\n$$\nThe mean-squared displacement (MSD) is $\\langle |\\Delta \\mathbf{r}(t)|^2 \\rangle = \\langle \\Delta \\mathbf{r}(t) \\cdot \\Delta \\mathbf{r}(t) \\rangle$. We expand this expression:\n$$\n\\langle |\\Delta \\mathbf{r}(t)|^2 \\rangle = \\left\\langle \\left( \\int_0^t v_0 \\mathbf{n}(s) ds \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\int_0^t v_0 \\mathbf{n}(s') ds' \\right) \\right\\rangle + \\left\\langle \\left( \\int_0^t \\sqrt{2 D_t} \\boldsymbol{\\xi}(s) ds \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\int_0^t \\sqrt{2 D_t} \\boldsymbol{\\xi}(s') ds' \\right) \\right\\rangle + 2 \\left\\langle \\left( \\int_0^t v_0 \\mathbf{n}(s) ds \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\int_0^t \\sqrt{2 D_t} \\boldsymbol{\\xi}(s') ds' \\right) \\right\\rangle\n$$\nThe first term is the active contribution. The second is the thermal contribution. The third is the cross-term. Since the orientation $\\mathbf{n}(s)$ and the thermal noise $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}(s')$ are uncorrelated for all $s$ and $s'$, and $\\boldsymbol{\\xi}$ has zero mean, the cross-term vanishes.\n\nLet us evaluate the thermal contribution:\n$$\n\\langle |\\Delta \\mathbf{r}(t)|_{\\text{thermal}}^2 \\rangle = 2 D_t \\int_0^t ds \\int_0^t ds' \\langle \\boldsymbol{\\xi}(s) \\cdot \\boldsymbol{\\xi}(s') \\rangle = 2 D_t \\int_0^t ds \\int_0^t ds' \\sum_{i=1}^d \\langle \\xi_i(s) \\xi_i(s') \\rangle\n$$\nUsing the property of white noise, $\\langle \\xi_i(s) \\xi_i(s') \\rangle = \\delta(s-s')$, we have:\n$$\n\\langle |\\Delta \\mathbf{r}(t)|_{\\text{thermal}}^2 \\rangle = 2 D_t \\int_0^t ds \\int_0^t ds' \\sum_{i=1}^d \\delta(s-s') = 2 D_t \\int_0^t ds \\cdot d = 2 d D_t t\n$$\nNow, we evaluate the active contribution in terms of $C_n(t)$:\n$$\n\\langle |\\Delta \\mathbf{r}(t)|_{\\text{active}}^2 \\rangle = v_0^2 \\int_0^t ds \\int_0^t ds' \\langle \\mathbf{n}(s) \\cdot \\mathbf{n}(s') \\rangle\n$$\nDue to the stationarity of the underlying stochastic process for the orientation, the correlation function only depends on the time difference: $\\langle \\mathbf{n}(s) \\cdot \\mathbf{n}(s') \\rangle = C_n(|s-s'|)$. The double integral can be transformed using the substitution $\\tau = s-s'$ and $u = s+s'$. More directly, it can be written as:\n$$\n\\int_0^t ds \\int_0^t ds' C_n(|s-s'|) = 2 \\int_0^t d\\tau (t-\\tau) C_n(\\tau)\n$$\nTherefore, the total MSD is:\n$$\n\\langle |\\Delta \\mathbf{r}(t)|^2 \\rangle = 2 d D_t t + 2 v_0^2 \\int_0^t (t-\\tau) C_n(\\tau) d\\tau\n$$\nThis completes Task 1.\n\nFor Task 2 (ABP), we must find $C_n(t)$. The orientation vector $\\mathbf{n}(t)$ undergoes rotational diffusion on a $(d-1)$-sphere. The evolution of its probability distribution is governed by the rotational diffusion equation $\\partial_t P = D_r \\nabla_S^2 P$, where $\\nabla_S^2$ is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the sphere. The orientation autocorrelation function $C_n(t) = \\langle \\mathbf{n}(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{n}(0) \\rangle$ can be calculated by considering the relaxation of the first spherical harmonic. The eigenvalues of the operator $-\\nabla_S^2$ are $\\lambda_l = l(l+d-2)$ for spherical harmonics of degree $l$. The components of the vector $\\mathbf{n}$ are first-degree ($l=1$) spherical harmonics. The correlation function of any $l=1$ mode decays with the corresponding eigenvalue $\\lambda_1 = 1(1+d-2) = d-1$. Thus, the decorrelation rate is $(d-1)D_r$.\n$$\nC_n(t) = \\langle \\mathbf{n}(0) \\cdot \\mathbf{n}(0) \\rangle \\exp(-(d-1)D_r t) = \\exp(-(d-1)D_r t)\n$$\nThe long-time effective diffusivity $D_{\\text{eff}}$ is found from the long-time limit of the MSD: $D_{\\text{eff}} = \\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\langle |\\Delta \\mathbf{r}(t)|^2 \\rangle}{2dt}$. The total MSD is $\\langle |\\Delta\\mathbf{r}(t)|^2\\rangle = 2dD_t t + 2 v_0^2 \\int_0^t (t-\\tau) C_n(\\tau)d\\tau$. In the limit $t \\to \\infty$, the integral $\\int_0^t (t-\\tau) C_n(\\tau)d\\tau \\approx t \\int_0^\\infty C_n(\\tau)d\\tau$.\nSo, $\\lim_{t\\to\\infty} \\langle |\\Delta \\mathbf{r}(t)|^2 \\rangle \\approx 2 d D_t t + 2 v_0^2 t \\int_0^\\infty C_n(\\tau) d\\tau$.\nThe effective diffusivity is $D_{\\text{eff}} = D_t + D_a$, where the active contribution is:\n$$\nD_a = \\frac{v_0^2}{d} \\int_0^\\infty C_n(\\tau)d\\tau\n$$\nFor the ABP, we compute this integral:\n$$\n\\int_0^\\infty C_n(\\tau)d\\tau = \\int_0^\\infty \\exp(-(d-1)D_r \\tau) d\\tau = \\frac{1}{(d-1)D_r}\n$$\nSo, the active diffusivity for the ABP is:\n$$\nD_a^{\\mathrm{ABP}} = \\frac{v_0^2}{d(d-1)D_r}\n$$\nThis completes Task 2.\n\nFor Task 3 (RTP), we find its orientation autocorrelation $C_n(t)$. A tumble event, occurring at rate $\\alpha$, randomizes the orientation. The probability that no tumble occurs in the interval $[0, t]$ is given by the Poisson distribution, $P_0(t) = \\exp(-\\alpha t)$. If no tumble occurs, $\\mathbf{n}(t) = \\mathbf{n}(0)$. If one or more tumbles occur, the new orientation is uncorrelated with the initial one, so $\\langle \\mathbf{n}(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{n}(0) \\rangle_{\\text{tumbled}} = 0$.\nThe total correlation is the weighted average:\n$$\nC_n(t) = \\langle \\mathbf{n}(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{n}(0) \\rangle = \\langle \\mathbf{n}(0) \\cdot \\mathbf{n}(0) \\rangle \\cdot P_0(t) + \\langle \\mathbf{n}(t) \\cdot \\mathbf{n}(0) \\rangle_{\\text{tumbled}} \\cdot (1-P_0(t))\n$$\n$$\nC_n(t) = 1 \\cdot \\exp(-\\alpha t) + 0 \\cdot (1-\\exp(-\\alpha t)) = \\exp(-\\alpha t)\n$$\nNow we compute the active diffusivity $D_a^{\\mathrm{RTP}}$:\n$$\n\\int_0^\\infty C_n(\\tau)d\\tau = \\int_0^\\infty \\exp(-\\alpha \\tau) d\\tau = \\frac{1}{\\alpha}\n$$\n$$\nD_a^{\\mathrm{RTP}} = \\frac{v_0^2}{d\\alpha}\n$$\nThis completes Task 3.\n\nFor Task 4, we compute the crossover times $t_c$ using the given definition: $v_0^2 t_c^2 = 2 d D_a t_c$. Since we assume $t_c > 0$, we can divide by $v_0^2 t_c$:\n$$\nt_c = \\frac{2d D_a}{v_0^2}\n$$\nFor the ABP:\n$$\nt_c^{\\mathrm{ABP}} = \\frac{2d}{v_0^2} D_a^{\\mathrm{ABP}} = \\frac{2d}{v_0^2} \\frac{v_0^2}{d(d-1)D_r} = \\frac{2}{(d-1)D_r}\n$$\nFor the RTP:\n$$\nt_c^{\\mathrm{RTP}} = \\frac{2d}{v_0^2} D_a^{\\mathrm{RTP}} = \\frac{2d}{v_0^2} \\frac{v_0^2}{d\\alpha} = \\frac{2}{\\alpha}\n$$\nThis completes Task 4.\n\nFor Task 5, we compare the intermediate-time scaling. The active part of the MSD is given by $\\text{MSD}_a(t) = 2 v_0^2 \\int_0^t (t-\\tau) C_n(\\tau) d\\tau$.\nFor the ABP, let $\\tau_p^{\\mathrm{ABP}} = 1/((d-1)D_r)$. Then $C_n(t) = \\exp(-t/\\tau_p^{\\mathrm{ABP}})$.\nFor the RTP, let $\\tau_p^{\\mathrm{RTP}} = 1/\\alpha$. Then $C_n(t) = \\exp(-t/\\tau_p^{\\mathrm{RTP}})$.\nIn both cases, the correlation function is a single exponential, $C_n(t) = \\exp(-t/\\tau_p)$, where $\\tau_p$ is the persistence time of the orientation.\nLet us perform the integration for a generic exponential correlation:\n$$\n\\int_0^t (t-\\tau) \\exp(-\\tau/\\tau_p) d\\tau = \\left[ -(t-\\tau)\\tau_p \\exp(-\\tau/\\tau_p) \\right]_0^t - \\int_0^t (-\\tau_p) \\exp(-\\tau/\\tau_p) (-1) d\\tau\n$$\n$$\n= t\\tau_p - \\tau_p \\int_0^t \\exp(-\\tau/\\tau_p) d\\tau = t\\tau_p - \\tau_p [-\\tau_p \\exp(-\\tau/\\tau_p)]_0^t = t\\tau_p - \\tau_p^2 (1 - \\exp(-t/\\tau_p))\n$$\nThus, for both models, the active contribution to the MSD has the same functional form when expressed in terms of the respective persistence time $\\tau_p$:\n$$\n\\text{MSD}_a(t) = 2 v_0^2 \\tau_p^2 \\left( \\frac{t}{\\tau_p} - 1 + \\exp(-t/\\tau_p) \\right)\n$$\nThe crossover from the short-time ballistic regime ($\\text{MSD}_a(t) \\approx v_0^2 t^2$ for $t \\ll \\tau_p$) to the long-time diffusive regime ($\\text{MSD}_a(t) \\approx (2 v_0^2 \\tau_p) t$ for $t \\gg \\tau_p$) is therefore qualitatively identical for both models. The fundamental difference lies in the physical mechanism that sets the persistence time $\\tau_p$: continuous rotational diffusion for the ABP versus discrete, instantaneous tumbles for the RTP. However, the resulting macroscopic motion, as characterized by the mean-squared displacement, exhibits the same crossover behavior.\n\nThe final answer requires the expressions for $t_c^{\\mathrm{ABP}}$ and $t_c^{\\mathrm{RTP}}$.\n$t_c^{\\mathrm{ABP}} = \\frac{2}{(d-1)D_r}$\n$t_c^{\\mathrm{RTP}} = \\frac{2}{\\alpha}$\nThese are to be presented in a row matrix.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} \\frac{2}{(d-1)D_r}  \\frac{2}{\\alpha} \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2906697"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond free space, we now explore how active particles behave within an external potential, a scenario vital for understanding phenomena like cell guidance and active matter self-organization.

In the limit of small persistence time $\\tau$, the dynamics of $x(t)$ can be approximated by a Markovian process described by an effective Fokker-Planck equation (FPE). A standard procedure for this is the unified colored noise approximation (UCNA), also known as the Fox-Hänggi-Jung approximation, which is valid to first order in $\\tau$. For a general system $\\dot{x} = f(x) + g(x)v(t)$, the effective FPE for the probability density $p(x,t)$ is given by\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} [K_1(x) p] + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} [K_2(x) p]\n$$\nIn our case, $f(x) = -\\mu U'(x)$ and $g(x) = 1$.

The problem asks for the stationary weight $p(x)$ associated with this FPE. The stationary probability distribution $p(x)$ is found by setting the probability current $J(x)$ to zero. For an FPE of the form $\\partial_t p = -\\partial_x [A(x)p] + \\partial_x^2 [B(x)p]$, the current is $J(x) = A(x)p(x) - \\partial_x [B(x)p(x)]$.

For the full AOUP dynamics, the action can be written as:\n$$\nS[x] = \\frac{1}{4D}\\int dt \\left[ \\tau\\left(\\ddot{x}+\\mu U''(x)\\dot{x}\\right) + \\left(\\dot{x}+\\mu U'(x)\\right) \\right]^2\n$$\nThe problem asks to argue that for a quadratic potential, this formalism yields the same $\\Delta\\Phi_{eff}$ as found above. A formal calculation expanding this action for small $\\tau$ and finding the minimum is complex, but a powerful general argument exists.\n\nFor any potential $U(x)$ that is quadratic, its second derivative $U''(x)$ is a constant, and all higher derivatives are zero. In this specific case, the equation for the most probable escape path, derived from the Euler-Lagrange equation $\\delta S/\\delta x=0$, becomes a linear ordinary differential equation with constant coefficients. This implies that the underlying stochastic process is a linear transformation of Gaussian noise, preserving its Gaussian character.\n\nCrucially, for linear stochastic systems driven by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise, the adiabatic elimination procedure is not an approximation but is exact. The effective Fokker-Planck equation derived in part (1) is the exact FPE for the marginal probability density $p(x,t)$. Consequently, the effective potential $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}(x)$ derived from its stationary solution is the exact potential governing the stationary statistics of the particle's position.\n\nTherefore, for a quadratic potential, the barrier height $\\Delta\\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ computed from our effective potential is not merely a first-order approximation but corresponds to the exact exponent in the escape rate. Since our calculation for $\\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}(x)$ and the resulting $\\Delta \\Phi_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ was performed to first order in $\\tau$, it must coincide with the first-order expansion of the exact result that would be obtained from a full (and more complex) path-integral calculation. This confirms the consistency of the two approaches for this class of potentials.\n\nThe final expression for the effective barrier height is thus robust.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{\\mu\\kappa L^2}{2D}(1 - \\tau\\mu\\kappa)}$$", "id": "2906687"}, {"introduction": "A crucial challenge in soft matter physics is to connect theoretical models with experimental observations.

It presents a standard, albeit non-trivial, analytical task based on the Active Brownian Particle (ABP) model. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a full derivation is warranted.\n\nThe solution is partitioned into two sub-problems as requested: first, the derivation of an estimator for the self-propulsion speed $v_{0}$, and second, an estimator for the rotational diffusivity $D_{r}$.\n\n**Part 1: Estimator for Self-Propulsion Speed $v_{0}$**\n\nWe begin by deriving the theoretical mean-squared displacement (MSD) for an ABP, including the effects of translational diffusion and measurement noise. The position $\\boldsymbol{r}(t)$ evolves according to the Langevin equation $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{r}}(t) = v_{0}\\,\\boldsymbol{u}(t) + \\sqrt{2 D_{t}}\\,\\boldsymbol{\\xi}(t)$.

The self-propulsion and translational noise terms are uncorrelated, so their cross-term vanishes upon averaging. The total MSD is the sum of the contributions from each term.\nThe contribution from translational diffusion is standard: $\\langle |\\sqrt{2 D_{t}} \\int_{t}^{t+\\tau} \\boldsymbol{\\xi}(s)ds|^{2} \\rangle = 4D_{t}\\tau$ for two dimensions.\nThe contribution from active motion is\n$$\nv_{0}^{2} \\left\\langle \\left| \\int_{t}^{t+\\tau} \\boldsymbol{u}(s)ds \\right|^{2} \\right\\rangle = v_{0}^{2} \\int_{t}^{t+\\tau} \\int_{t}^{t+\\tau} \\langle \\boldsymbol{u}(s) \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}(s') \\rangle ds ds'.\n$$\nUsing the stationary orientation correlation $\\langle \\boldsymbol{u}(s) \\cdot \\boldsymbol{u}(s') \\rangle = \\exp(-D_{r}|s-s'|)$, this double integral evaluates to\n$$\nv_{0}^{2} \\int_{0}^{\\tau} \\int_{0}^{\\tau} \\exp(-D_{r}|s-s'|) ds ds' = \\frac{2v_{0}^{2}}{D_{r}^{2}} \\left( D_{r}\\tau - 1 + \\exp(-D_{r}\\tau) \\right).\n$$\nThus, the true MSD is $M(\\tau) = \\frac{2v_{0}^{2}}{D_{r}^{2}} (D_{r}\\tau - 1 + \\exp(-D_{r}\\tau)) + 4D_{t}\\tau$.\n\nThe measured position is $\\boldsymbol{r}_{\\mathrm{m}}(t_{n}) = \\boldsymbol{r}(t_{n}) + \\boldsymbol{\\eta}_{n}$, where $\\boldsymbol{\\eta}_{n}$ is localization noise with $\\langle \\eta_{n,\\alpha}\\eta_{m,\\beta}\\rangle = \\sigma^{2}\\delta_{nm}\\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}$.

For $k \\ge 1$, $\\boldsymbol{\\eta}_{n+k}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\eta}_{n}$ are uncorrelated. Therefore,\n$$\nM_{\\mathrm{m}}(k\\Delta) = M(k\\Delta) + \\langle|\\boldsymbol{\\eta}_{n+k}|^{2}\\rangle + \\langle|\\boldsymbol{\\eta}_{n}|^{2}\\rangle = M(k\\Delta) + 2\\sigma^{2} + 2\\sigma^{2} = M(k\\Delta) + 4\\sigma^{2}.\n$$\nThe full expression for the measured MSD is\n$$\nM_{\\mathrm{m}}(\\tau) = \\frac{2v_{0}^{2}}{D_{r}^{2}} \\left( D_{r}\\tau - 1 + \\exp(-D_{r}\\tau) \\right) + 4D_{t}\\tau + 4\\sigma^{2}.\n$$\nTo construct an estimator for $v_{0}$ that is robust to $\\sigma^{2}$ and $D_{t}$, we form a linear combination of the measured MSD at lags $\\tau_{s} = \\Delta, 2\\Delta, 3\\Delta$ that cancels the constant term ($4\\sigma^2$) and the term linear in time ($4D_t\\tau$). The discrete second derivative operator, applied to a function $f(k\\Delta)$, is $f((k+1)\\Delta) - 2f(k\\Delta) + f((k-1)\\Delta)$. We apply this structure using the specified lags: $M_{\\mathrm{m}}(3\\Delta) - 2M_{\\mathrm{m}}(2\\Delta) + M_{\\mathrm{m}}(\\Delta)$.

From this, we construct the estimator for $v_{0}^{2}$:\n$$\n\\hat{v}_{0}^{2} = \\frac{M_{\\mathrm{m}}(3\\Delta) - 2M_{\\mathrm{m}}(2\\Delta) + M_{\\mathrm{m}}(\\Delta)}{2\\Delta^{2}}.\n$$\nTaking the square root gives the estimator for $v_{0}$.\n\n**Part 2: Estimator for Rotational Diffusivity $D_{r}$**\n\nWe derive the expected functional form of the coarse-grained velocity autocorrelation function (VACF). The measured velocity is $\\boldsymbol{v}_{\\mathrm{m}}(t_{n}) = (\\boldsymbol{r}_{\\mathrm{m}}(t_{n+1}) - \\boldsymbol{r}_{\\mathrm{m}}(t_{n}))/\\Delta$. The VACF at lag $\\ell\\Delta$ is $C_{\\mathrm{m}}(\\ell\\Delta) = \\langle \\boldsymbol{v}_{\\mathrm{m}}(t_{n}) \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}_{\\mathrm{m}}(t_{n+\\ell}) \\rangle$.\nSubstituting the definition of $\\boldsymbol{v}_{\\mathrm{m}}$, we have\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{m}}(\\ell\\Delta) = \\frac{1}{\\Delta^{2}} \\left\\langle \\left( \\Delta\\boldsymbol{r}_{n} + \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\eta}_{n} \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\Delta\\boldsymbol{r}_{n+\\ell} + \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\eta}_{n+\\ell} \\right) \\right\\rangle,\n$$\nwhere $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{r}_{j} = \\boldsymbol{r}_{j+1}-\\boldsymbol{r}_{j}$ and $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\eta}_{j} = \\boldsymbol{\\eta}_{j+1}-\\boldsymbol{\\eta}_{j}$.\nFor $\\ell \\ge 1$, the time indices of the noise terms in the first factor, $n$ and $n+1$, are distinct from those in the second factor, $n+\\ell$ and $n+\\ell+1$. Given $\\langle\\boldsymbol{\\eta}_{i}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\eta}_{j}\\rangle \\propto \\delta_{ij}$, the noise term $\\langle \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\eta}_{n} \\cdot \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\eta}_{n+\\ell} \\rangle$ is zero. The cross-terms involving $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{r}$ and $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\eta}$ are also zero. Thus, for $\\ell \\ge 1$, localization noise does not contribute to the VACF.\n$$\nC_{\\mathrm{m}}(\\ell\\Delta) = C(\\ell\\Delta) = \\frac{1}{\\Delta^{2}} \\langle \\Delta\\boldsymbol{r}_{n} \\cdot \\Delta\\boldsymbol{r}_{n+\\ell} \\rangle.\n$$\nSubstituting the integral form of the displacement $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{r}_{n} = v_0 \\int_{n\\Delta}^{(n+1)\\Delta} \\boldsymbol{u}(t) dt + \\sqrt{2D_t} \\int_{n\\Delta}^{(n+1)\\Delta} \\boldsymbol{\\xi}(t) dt$. For $\\ell \\ge 1$, the integration intervals for $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{r}_n$ and $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{r}_{n+\\ell}$ are disjoint. The increments of the Wiener process are therefore uncorrelated, so the translational diffusion term $\\langle (\\int \\boldsymbol{\\xi} dt) \\cdot (\\int \\boldsymbol{\\xi} dt) \\rangle$ vanishes.
