The Tanford relations are standard empirical formulae, and the provided data for SDS are physically realistic. The problem is well-posed, self-contained, and objective, with all necessary parameters and constraints defined for deriving a unique solution. There are no scientific unsoundness, contradictions, or ambiguities.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action.\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe primary objective is to derive the dimensionless parameter that governs the geometry of self-assembled surfactant aggregates. This parameter, often denoted as the critical packing parameter, $P$, arises from the geometric relationship between the volume of the hydrophobic tail, $v$, the area of the hydrophilic headgroup at the aggregate-water interface, $a_0$, and the maximum effective length of the tail, $l_c$.\n\nConsider an aggregate composed of $N$ surfactant molecules. The total volume of the hydrophobic core, $V_{core}$, is the sum of the volumes of the individual hydrocarbon tails, assuming incompressibility:\n$$V_{core} = N v$$\nThe total surface area of the core at the interface with the aqueous phase, $A_{interface}$, is determined by the sum of the headgroup areas:\n$$A_{interface} = N a_0$$\nThe core of the aggregate is a geometric object whose characteristic dimension, let us call it the radius $R$, is constrained by the maximum length of the hydrocarbon tail, $l_c$. That is, $R \\le l_c$. The relationship between the volume and surface area of a simple geometric shape of radius $R$ can be written as:\n$$V_{core} = k A_{interface} R$$\nwhere $k$ is a numerical factor that depends on the geometry. For a sphere, $V = \\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3$ and $A = 4\\pi R^2$, so $V = \\frac{A R}{3}$, which gives $k = 1/3$. For an infinite cylinder, $V = \\pi R^2 L$ and $A = 2\\pi R L$ (for a length $L$), so $V = \\frac{A R}{2}$, which gives $k = 1/2$. For a planar bilayer of thickness $2R$, $V = A R$, which gives $k=1$.\n\nBy substituting the expressions for $V_{core}$ and $A_{interface}$ in terms of the molecular parameters, we obtain:\n$$N v = k (N a_0) R$$\nDividing by $N$ simplifies the expression to a relationship between the single-molecule properties and the aggregate geometry:\n$$v = k a_0 R$$\nThe constraint that the chains cannot be stretched beyond their maximum length, $l_c$, implies that the optimal or preferred radius of curvature is achieved when $R$ approaches $l_c$. To determine the preferred geometry, we set $R=l_c$:\n$$v \\approx k a_0 l_c$$\nRearranging this equation isolates the dimensionless combination of molecular parameters on one side and the geometric factor on the other:\n$$\\frac{v}{a_0 l_c} = k$$\nThis dimensionless group, $P = \\frac{v}{a_0 l_c}$, is the packing parameter. Its value dictates the preferred aggregate geometry by determining the value of $k$, consistent with the provided morphology map.\n\nNow, we calculate the value of this parameter for SDS using the provided data.\nGiven $n_c=12$.\nFirst, calculate the tail volume, $v$, using the Tanford relation:\n$$v = 27.4 + 26.9\\,n_c = 27.4 + 26.9(12) = 27.4 + 322.8 = 350.2\\,\\text{\\AA}^3$$\nNext, calculate the maximum tail length, $l_c$:\n$$l_c = 1.5 + 1.265\\,n_c = 1.5 + 1.265(12) = 1.5 + 15.18 = 16.68\\,\\text{\\AA}$$\nThe headgroup area is given as $a_0 = 62\\,\\text{\\AA}^2$.\n\nWe can now compute the packing parameter $P$:\n$$P = \\frac{v}{a_0 l_c} = \\frac{350.2\\,\\text{\\AA}^3}{(62\\,\\text{\\AA}^2)(16.68\\,\\text{\\AA})}$$\n$$P = \\frac{350.2}{1034.16} \\approx 0.33863$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$P \\approx 0.339$$\nAccording to the provided morphology map, a value of $P \\approx 0.339$ is slightly greater than $1/3$ (which is approximately $0.333$). This places the aggregate morphology in the regime of cylindrical micelles, at the boundary with spherical micelles. This result is physically reasonable, as SDS is known to form spherical micelles that can transition to rod-like (cylindrical) micelles upon changes in conditions such as increased surfactant concentration or added salt, which would decrease $a_0$ and thus increase $P$.\nThe derived dimensionless combination is $\\frac{v}{a_0 l_c}$, and its calculated value for SDS under the specified conditions is $0.339$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.339}\n$$", "id": "2934197"}, {"introduction": "While the packing parameter provides a useful rule of thumb, its predictive power is rooted in the fundamental thermodynamics of self-assembly.

The total interfacial free energy is $F = \\gamma A$.

This transition occurs at the boundary of the inequality, where the required optimal radius equals the maximum allowed length:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{s}}^{\\mathrm{opt}} = l_{\\mathrm{c}} \\implies \\frac{3v}{a_{0}} = l_{\\mathrm{c}}\n$$\nThis gives the critical value of the packing parameter:\n$$\nP_{\\mathrm{crit}} = \\frac{v}{a_{0}l_{\\mathrm{c}}} = \\frac{1}{3}\n$$\nFor $P > 1/3$, a spherical geometry is geometrically frustrated; it cannot satisfy both the optimal area requirement and the tail length constraint simultaneously.\n\nThe problem statement also requires that at this critical point, the capped cylinder *can* still realize the optimal geometry. We must verify this.\nAt the transition point where $P = 1/3$, we have $a_{0} = \\frac{3v}{l_{\\mathrm{c}}}$.

According to the problem statement, this is given by the apparent outer radius minus the hydrophilic layer thickness.\n$$R_{\\mathrm{c}}^{(\\mathrm{sph})} = \\frac{D_{\\mathrm{out}}^{(\\mathrm{sph})}}{2} - t_{\\mathrm{int}}$$\nUsing the given values $D_{\\mathrm{out}}^{(\\mathrm{sph})} = 5.8\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ and $t_{\\mathrm{int}} = 1.1\\,\\mathrm{nm}$:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{c}}^{(\\mathrm{sph})} = \\frac{5.8\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{2} - 1.1\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 2.9\\,\\mathrm{nm} - 1.1\\,\\mathrm{nm} = 1.8\\,\\mathrm{nm}$$\n\nNow we can calculate the headgroup area $a_{0}$:\n$$a_{0} = \\frac{3 \\times 0.350\\,\\mathrm{nm}^3}{1.8\\,\\mathrm{nm}} = \\frac{1.05\\,\\mathrm{nm}^3}{1.8\\,\\mathrm{nm}} = \\frac{105}{180}\\,\\mathrm{nm}^2 = \\frac{7}{12}\\,\\mathrm{nm}^2 \\approx 0.5833\\,\\mathrm{nm}^2$$\n\nWith all three parameters determined ($v$, $a_{0}$, and $l_{\\mathrm{c}}$), we can now compute the packing parameter $P$.\n$$P = \\frac{v}{a_{0} l_{\\mathrm{c}}} = \\frac{0.350\\,\\mathrm{nm}^3}{(\\frac{7}{12}\\,\\mathrm{nm}^2) \\times (1.6\\,\\mathrm{nm})}$$\n$$P = \\frac{0.350}{\\frac{7 \\times 1.6}{12}} = \\frac{0.350 \\times 12}{11.2} = \\frac{4.2}{11.2} = \\frac{42}{112}$$\nDividing the numerator and denominator by $14$ simplifies the fraction:\n$$P = \\frac{3}{8} = 0.375$$\nThe result is required to three significant figures, which $0.375$ already is.\n\nAlternatively, by substituting the derived expression for $a_{0}$ directly into the definition of $P$:\n$$P = \\frac{v}{a_{0} l_{\\mathrm{c}}} = \\frac{v}{\\left(\\frac{3v}{R_{\\mathrm{c}}^{(\\mathrm{sph})}}\\right) l_{\\mathrm{c}}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{c}}^{(\\mathrm{sph})}}{3 l_{\\mathrm{c}}}$$\nThis elegant result shows that for a spherical geometry, the packing parameter is given by the ratio of the core radius to three times the maximal chain length. Using our calculated values:\n$$P = \\frac{1.8\\,\\mathrm{nm}}{3 \\times 1.6\\,\\mathrm{nm}} = \\frac{1.8}{4.8} = \\frac{18}{48} = \\frac{3}{8} = 0.375$$\n\nFinally, we assess the consistency of this value with the experimental observation. The geometric packing theory predicts aggregate morphology based on the value of $P$:\n- $P  \\frac{1}{3}$: spherical micelles\n- $\\frac{1}{3}  P  \\frac{1}{2}$: cylindrical micelles\n- $\\frac{1}{2}  P  1$: vesicles or flexible bilayers\n- $P \\approx 1$: planar bilayers (lamellae)\n\nOur calculated value is $P = 0.375$. Since $\\frac{1}{3} \\approx 0.333$ and $\\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$, our result $P=0.375$ falls squarely within the range predicted for the formation of cylindrical micelles ($0.333  0.375  0.5$). The fact that this value is close to the lower bound of $\\frac{1}{3}$ is also consistent with the coexistence of spherical micelles. The predominance of cylindrical micelles is therefore fully consistent with the calculated packing parameter based on the supplied geometric data.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.375}$$", "id": "2934225"}]}
