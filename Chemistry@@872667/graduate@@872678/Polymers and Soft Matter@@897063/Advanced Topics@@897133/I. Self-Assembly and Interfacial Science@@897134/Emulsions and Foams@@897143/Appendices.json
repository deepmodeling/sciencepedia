The objectives are clear and logically sequenced.\n- **Objective:** The language is formal, precise, and free of any subjective or ambiguous terminology.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is scientifically valid, well-posed, and objective. A solution will be formulated.\n\nWe begin with the governing equations for an incompressible Newtonian fluid in the creeping flow regime (low Reynolds number), which are the Stokes and continuity equations:\n$$ \\nabla p = \\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v} $$\n$$ \\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{v} = 0 $$\nwhere $p$ is the pressure, $\\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity field, and $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity. The film has thickness $h(x,y,t)$, and we align the coordinate system such that the mid-plane of the film is at $z=0$, with interfaces at $z = \\pm h/2$.\n\nUnder the lubrication approximation for a thin film ($h \\ll L$, where $L$ is a characteristic lateral length scale), the derivatives along the film ($x, y$) are much smaller than the derivative across the film ($z$). The velocity components simplify such that $|v_x|, |v_y| \\gg |v_z|$. The Stokes equations reduce to:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} = \\eta \\frac{\\partial^2 v_x}{\\partial z^2} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial y} = \\eta \\frac{\\partial^2 v_y}{\\partial z^2} $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} = 0 $$\nThe last equation implies that the pressure $p$ is constant across the film thickness, so $p = p(x,y,t)$.\n\nThe interfaces are stated to be \"immobilized,\" which imposes a no-slip boundary condition: $v_x(z=\\pm h/2)=0$ and $v_y(z=\\pm h/2)=0$. Integrating the simplified Stokes equation for $v_x$ twice with respect to $z$ yields:\n$$ v_x(z) = \\frac{1}{2\\eta} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} z^2 + C_1 z + C_2 $$\nDue to symmetry of the flow profile about the mid-plane $z=0$, the velocity must be an even function of $z$, which requires $C_1=0$. Applying the no-slip condition at $z=h/2$:\n$$ 0 = \\frac{1}{2\\eta} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} \\left(\\frac{h}{2}\\right)^2 + C_2 \\implies C_2 = -\\frac{h^2}{8\\eta} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} $$\nThis gives the parabolic (Poiseuille) velocity profile:\n$$ v_x(z) = \\frac{1}{2\\eta} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} \\left(z^2 - \\frac{h^2}{4}\\right) $$\nAn analogous expression holds for $v_y(z)$.\n\nThe volumetric flux (flow rate per unit width) in the $x$-direction, $q_x$, is obtained by integrating $v_x(z)$ across the film thickness:\n$$ q_x = \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} v_x(z) dz = \\frac{1}{2\\eta} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} \\left(z^2 - \\frac{h^2}{4}\\right) dz = -\\frac{h^3}{12\\eta} \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} $$\nThe total flux vector is thus $\\mathbf{q} = (q_x, q_y) = -\\frac{h^3}{12\\eta} \\nabla_{xy} p$, where $\\nabla_{xy}$ is the gradient operator in the $(x,y)$ plane.\n\nThe pressure inside the liquid film $p$ is related to the external gas pressure $p_{\\mathrm{gas}}$ through the augmented Young-Laplace equation, which includes capillarity and disjoining pressure $\\Pi(h)$.\n$$ p = p_{\\mathrm{gas}} - \\Pi(h) - p_{\\mathrm{cap}} $$\nIn the lubrication limit, the capillary pressure is $p_{\\mathrm{cap}} = \\sigma \\nabla^2_{xy} h$. The in-film pressure is:\n$$ p(x,y,t) = p_{\\mathrm{gas}} - \\Pi(h) - \\sigma \\nabla^2_{xy} h $$\nIn the nearly flat interior of the lamella, the curvature term is negligible, so the in-film pressure is approximately $p \\approx p_{\\mathrm{gas}} - \\Pi(h)$. The volumetric flux is driven by the pressure gradient:\n$$ \\mathbf{q} = -\\frac{h^3}{12\\eta} \\nabla_{xy} (p_{\\mathrm{gas}} - \\Pi(h) - \\sigma \\nabla^2_{xy} h) = \\frac{h^3}{12\\eta} \\nabla_{xy} (\\Pi(h) + \\sigma \\nabla^2_{xy} h) $$\nThe evolution of the film thickness $h(x,y,t)$ is governed by mass conservation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t} + \\nabla_{xy} \\cdot \\mathbf{q} = 0 $$\nSubstituting the flux gives the lubrication evolution equation:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t} + \\nabla_{xy} \\cdot \\left[ \\frac{h^3}{12\\eta} \\nabla_{xy} (\\Pi(h) + \\sigma \\nabla^2_{xy} h) \\right] = 0 $$\nDrainage is arrested when the pressure in the film equals the pressure in the Plateau border, $p_{\\mathrm{film}} = p_{\\mathrm{PB}}$. For a uniform film ($h=h_e$, $\\nabla^2 h=0$), this means $p_{\\mathrm{gas}} - \\Pi(h_e) = p_{\\mathrm{gas}} - p_c$. The mechanical condition is:\n$$ \\Pi(h_e) = p_c $$\nTo analyze stability, we linearize the evolution equation for a small perturbation $h(x,y,t) = h_e + \\delta h(x,y,t)$.\n$$ \\frac{\\partial (\\delta h)}{\\partial t} + \\frac{h_e^3}{12\\eta} \\nabla_{xy} \\cdot \\left[ \\nabla_{xy} (\\Pi'(h_e)\\delta h + \\sigma \\nabla^2_{xy} \\delta h) \\right] = 0 $$\n$$ \\frac{\\partial (\\delta h)}{\\partial t} + \\frac{h_e^3}{12\\eta} \\left( \\Pi'(h_e) \\nabla^2_{xy} \\delta h + \\sigma \\nabla^4_{xy} \\delta h \\right) = 0 $$\nwhere $\\Pi'(h_e) = \\frac{d\\Pi}{dh}|_{h=h_e}$. We test a Fourier mode perturbation $\\delta h \\sim \\exp(i\\mathbf{k} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} + \\omega t)$, for which $\\nabla^2_{xy}\\delta h = -k^2\\delta h$ and $\\nabla^4_{xy}\\delta h = k^4\\delta h$. This gives the dispersion relation for the growth rate $\\omega$:\n$$ \\omega \\delta h + \\frac{h_e^3}{12\\eta} \\left( -\\Pi'(h_e) k^2 \\delta h + \\sigma k^4 \\delta h \\right) = 0 $$\n$$ \\omega(k) = \\frac{h_e^3}{12\\eta} \\left( \\Pi'(h_e) k^2 - \\sigma k^4 \\right) $$\nA uniform film is stable if perturbations decay, i.e., $\\omega(k)  0$ for all $k > 0$. Long-wavelength perturbations ($k \\to 0$) are governed by the $\\Pi'(h_e)k^2$ term. For stability against these modes, we require $\\Pi'(h_e)  0$. This is the linear stability criterion. A negative derivative means that if the film thins locally (h decreases), the repulsive disjoining pressure increases, pushing the interfaces apart and restoring the original thickness.\n\nFinally, we apply these conditions to the specified disjoining pressure: $\\Pi(h) = \\Pi_0 \\exp(-\\kappa h)$, with $\\Pi_0  0, \\kappa  0$.\nThe equilibrium condition $\\Pi(h_e) = p_c$ becomes:\n$$ \\Pi_0 \\exp(-\\kappa h_e) = p_c $$\nSolving for $h_e$:\n$$ \\exp(-\\kappa h_e) = \\frac{p_c}{\\Pi_0} \\implies -\\kappa h_e = \\ln\\left(\\frac{p_c}{\\Pi_0}\\right) $$\n$$ h_e = \\frac{1}{\\kappa} \\ln\\left(\\frac{\\Pi_0}{p_c}\\right) $$\nFor a physically meaningful equilibrium thickness ($h_e > 0$), the argument of the logarithm must be greater than $1$. This gives the parameter constraint for existence of the equilibrium:\n$$ \\frac{\\Pi_0}{p_c}  1 \\implies \\Pi_0  p_c $$\nThis means the maximum possible repulsive disjoining pressure (as $h \\to 0$) must exceed the applied suction pressure.\n\nNow, we check the stability of this equilibrium. The stability criterion is $\\Pi'(h_e)  0$. We compute the derivative of $\\Pi(h)$:\n$$ \\frac{d\\Pi}{dh} = \\frac{d}{dh} \\left[ \\Pi_0 \\exp(-\\kappa h) \\right] = -\\kappa \\Pi_0 \\exp(-\\kappa h) $$\nSince $\\kappa > 0$, $\\Pi_0 > 0$, and the exponential term is always positive, we have $\\frac{d\\Pi}{dh}  0$ for all $h > 0$. Thus, the stability condition $\\Pi'(h_e)  0$ is always satisfied for this repulsive disjoining pressure.\nTherefore, a stable equilibrium thickness $h_e$ exists if and only if $\\Pi_0 > p_c$, and its value is given by the expression derived above.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{1}{\\kappa}\\ln\\left(\\frac{\\Pi_0}{p_c}\\right)}$$", "id": "2914383"}]}
