It requires the derivation of a fundamental relationship in surface science from first principles and its subsequent numerical evaluation. We shall proceed.\n\nThe system involves a three-phase contact line where solid (s), liquid (l), and vapor (v) phases meet. The equilibrium state is governed by the minimization of the total free energy. This can be analyzed from two equivalent perspectives: a mechanical balance of forces at the contact line and a thermodynamic consideration of the work required to alter the interfacial areas.\n\nFirst, we consider the mechanical equilibrium condition at the three-phase contact line, as required by point (i) of the problem. At the contact line, there are three interfacial tensions acting. These are the solid-vapor interfacial tension, $\\gamma_{sv}$; the solid-liquid interfacial tension, $\\gamma_{sl}$; and the liquid-vapor interfacial tension, $\\gamma_{lv}$. Each tension represents a force per unit length acting along the respective interface. For the system to be in mechanical equilibrium, the vector sum of these forces must be zero. We are concerned with the components of these forces parallel to the solid substrate.\n\nThe force due to $\\gamma_{sv}$ acts along the solid-vapor interface.\nThe force due to $\\gamma_{sl}$ acts along the solid-liquid interface, opposing the $\\gamma_{sv}$ force.\nThe force due to $\\gamma_{lv}$ acts tangentially to the liquid-vapor interface at an angle $\\theta$, the equilibrium contact angle, with respect to the solid substrate.\n\nThe balance of forces parallel to the substrate is thus given by:\n$$\n\\gamma_{sv} = \\gamma_{sl} + \\gamma_{lv} \\cos\\theta\n$$\nThis is the celebrated Young's equation. It relates the interfacial tensions to the macroscopic contact angle.\n\nSecond, we consider the thermodynamic definition of the work of adhesion, $W_{ad}$, as stipulated by point (ii) of the problem. The work of adhesion is defined as the reversible work required per unit area to separate a solid-liquid interface, creating a new solid-vapor interface and a new liquid-vapor interface in its place. According to the first law of thermodynamics for an isothermal, reversible process, the work done on the system, $W_{ad}$, equals the change in the total surface free energy of the system, $\\Delta G_{surf}$.\n\nConsider a system with an initial area of contact $A$ between the solid and liquid. The initial surface free energy of this interface is $G_{initial} = \\gamma_{sl} A$. We perform work to separate the liquid from the solid over this area $A$. The final state consists of a solid-vapor interface of area $A$ and a liquid-vapor interface of area $A$. The final surface free energy is $G_{final} = \\gamma_{sv} A + \\gamma_{lv} A$.\n\nThe work of adhesion per unit area, $W_{ad}$, is the work done divided by the area $A$:\n$$\nW_{ad} = \\frac{G_{final} - G_{initial}}{A} = \\frac{(\\gamma_{sv} A + \\gamma_{lv} A) - (\\gamma_{sl} A)}{A}\n$$\nSimplifying this expression gives the Dupre equation for the work of adhesion:\n$$\nW_{ad} = \\gamma_{sv} + \\gamma_{lv} - \\gamma_{sl}\n$$\nThis $W_{ad}$ is precisely the minimum reversible work per unit area to separate the liquid from the solid.\n\nThe problem requires an expression for $W_{ad}$ in terms of only $\\gamma_{lv}$ and $\\theta$. We can achieve this by combining the Young equation and the Dupre equation. From Young's equation, we can express the difference $(\\gamma_{sv} - \\gamma_{sl})$ as:\n$$\n\\gamma_{sv} - \\gamma_{sl} = \\gamma_{lv} \\cos\\theta\n$$\nNow, we substitute this result into the Dupre equation:\n$$\nW_{ad} = (\\gamma_{sv} - \\gamma_{sl}) + \\gamma_{lv} = (\\gamma_{lv} \\cos\\theta) + \\gamma_{lv}\n$$\nFactoring out $\\gamma_{lv}$, we arrive at the desired expression, known as the Young-Dupre equation:\n$$\nW_{ad} = \\gamma_{lv} (1 + \\cos\\theta)\n$$\nThis equation correctly relates the thermodynamic work of adhesion to the macroscopically measurable quantities of liquid-vapor surface tension and contact angle.\n\nFinally, we must evaluate this expression numerically for the given system.

The derivation must be from first principles, utilizing the definition of the total interfacial free energy and the local application of Young's equation.\n\nThe system's total interfacial free energy, $E$, is given by the sum of the energies of the three interfaces:\n$$E = \\gamma_{lv}A_{lv} + \\gamma_{sl}A_{sl} + \\gamma_{sv}A_{sv}$$\nwhere $\\gamma_{lv}$, $\\gamma_{sl}$, and $\\gamma_{sv}$ are the liquid-vapor, solid-liquid, and solid-vapor interfacial tensions, respectively, and $A_{lv}$, $A_{sl}$, and $A_{sv}$ are the corresponding interfacial areas.\n\nThe total area of the substrate surface under consideration is constant, $A_{sub} = A_{sl} + A_{sv}$.

This implies that the term $(\\gamma_{sl} - \\gamma_{sv})$ is not a single constant for the entire droplet but depends on the local contact angle $\\theta$ around the perimeter of the contact line.\n\nWe must evaluate the change in energy, $dE$, for an infinitesimal displacement $dx$. The term $\\gamma_{lv} \\frac{dA_{lv}}{dx}$ relates to the change in the droplet's surface area. For a quasi-static process where the droplet volume is conserved and the footprint radius $a$ is kept constant, this change is a second-order effect compared to the change in substrate energy and can be neglected. This is a standard simplification in this context. Thus, we consider:\n$$dE \\approx dE_{sub} = d((\\gamma_{sl} - \\gamma_{sv})A_{sl})$$\nLet us consider the displacement of the circular contact line of radius $a$ by a small distance $dx$ in the positive $x$-direction.

It requires the derivation and application of the relationship that governs the apparent contact angle of a liquid advancing over a solid surface. This relationship arises from the interplay between viscous forces, which cause dissipation in the liquid wedge near the contact line, and capillary forces, which drive the wetting process. All provided parameters are physically realistic and the assumptions are standard for the theoretical framework known as the Cox-Voinov-Tanner model.\n\nWe begin from the fundamental principles outlined in the problem statement. The flow is slow, steady, and occurs in a thin wedge, allowing for the use of the lubrication approximation to the Stokes equations for fluid motion. Let the solid substrate lie on the $x$-axis, with the contact line moving in the positive $x$-direction at a constant speed $U$. We analyze the flow in a frame of reference co-moving with the contact line. In this frame, the solid surface moves with velocity $-U$ in the $x$-direction. The height of the liquid-vapor interface is given by $h(x)$.\n\nUnder the lubrication approximation for a thin fluid film, the Navier-Stokes equations reduce to:\n$$ \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial x} = \\mu \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2} $$\nwhere $u(x, y)$ is the fluid velocity in the $x$-direction, $p(x)$ is the pressure, and $\\mu$ is the viscosity.

The pressure drop across the interface is $p_{liquid} - p_{vapor} = -\\gamma_{lv} \\kappa$, where $\\kappa$ is the interface curvature and $\\gamma_{lv}$ is the liquid-vapor surface tension. For small slopes $\\theta(x) = dh/dx$, the curvature is approximated by $\\kappa \\approx d^2h/dx^2$. The pressure gradient in the liquid is therefore:\n$$ \\frac{dp}{dx} = -\\gamma_{lv} \\frac{d\\kappa}{dx} \\approx -\\gamma_{lv} \\frac{d^3h}{dx^3} $$\nEquating the two expressions for the pressure gradient yields the governing third-order nonlinear ordinary differential equation for the interface profile $h(x)$:\n$$ \\gamma_{lv} \\frac{d^3h}{dx^3} = \\frac{3\\mu U}{h^2} $$\nThis equation describes how viscous stresses are balanced by the gradient of capillary pressure.
