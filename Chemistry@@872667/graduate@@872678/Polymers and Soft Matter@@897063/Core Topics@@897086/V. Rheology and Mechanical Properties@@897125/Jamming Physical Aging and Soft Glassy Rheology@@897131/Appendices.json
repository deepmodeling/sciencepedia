It does not violate any of the specified invalidity criteria. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid and a complete solution will be provided.\n\n**1) Derivation of the reduced variable dependence**\n\nWe begin with the integral expression for the stress relaxation modulus $G(t, t_w)$:\n$$\nG(t,t_w) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} H(\\tau,t_w)\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)\\,d\\ln \\tau\n$$\nWe substitute the given assumption for the aging of the relaxation spectrum, $H(\\tau,t_w) = H_0(\\tau/t_w^{\\mu})$:\n$$\nG(t,t_w) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} H_0\\left(\\frac{\\tau}{t_w^{\\mu}}\\right)\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau}\\right)\\,d\\ln \\tau\n$$\nTo reveal the underlying scaling, we perform a change of variables in the integral. Let the new integration variable be $\\tau'$ defined as:\n$$\n\\tau' = \\frac{\\tau}{t_w^{\\mu}} \\quad \\implies \\quad \\tau = \\tau' t_w^{\\mu}\n$$\nThe differential $d\\ln \\tau$ must also be transformed. We have $\\ln \\tau = \\ln(\\tau' t_w^{\\mu}) = \\ln \\tau' + \\mu \\ln t_w$. Since $t_w$ is a constant with respect to the integration variable $\\tau$, the differential becomes:\n$$\nd\\ln \\tau = d(\\ln \\tau') = d\\ln \\tau'\n$$\nThe integration limits for $\\tau'$ are the same as for $\\tau$: as $\\tau \\to 0$, $\\tau' \\to 0$, and as $\\tau \\to \\infty$, $\\tau' \\to \\infty$.\n\nNow, we rewrite the argument of the exponential function in terms of $\\tau'$:\n$$\n-\\frac{t}{\\tau} = -\\frac{t}{\\tau' t_w^{\\mu}} = -\\frac{1}{\\tau'} \\left(\\frac{t}{t_w^{\\mu}}\\right)\n$$\nSubstituting these transformed expressions back into the integral for $G(t,t_w)$, we obtain:\n$$\nG(t,t_w) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} H_0(\\tau')\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{\\tau'} \\left(\\frac{t}{t_w^{\\mu}}\\right)\\right)\\,d\\ln \\tau'\n$$\nThe right-hand side is an integral that depends on $t$ and $t_w$ only through the specific combination $t/t_w^{\\mu}$. We can therefore express $G(t,t_w)$ as a function of a single reduced variable. Let's define a function $F(x)$ as:\n$$\nF(x) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} H_0(\\tau')\\,\\exp\\left(-\\frac{x}{\\tau'}\\right)\\,d\\ln \\tau'\n$$\nThen, the stress relaxation modulus is given by:\n$$\nG(t,t_w) = F\\left(\\frac{t}{t_w^{\\mu}}\\right)\n$$\nThis demonstrates that $G(t,t_w)$ depends on $t$ and $t_w$ through the single reduced variable $x = t/t_w^{\\mu}$.\n\n**2) Superposition and determination of the aging exponent $\\mu$**\n\nPhysical aging implies that the material's relaxation processes slow down as the waiting time $t_w$ increases. The result from part 1), $G(t,t_w) = F(t/t_w^{\\mu})$, provides a quantitative basis for the principle of time-aging time superposition.\nExperimentally, one measures $G(t, t_w)$ for various $t_w$ and plots these curves against the logarithm of time, $\\log t$. Superposition means that these curves can be shifted horizontally along the $\\log t$ axis to collapse onto a single master curve.\n\nLet us choose a reference waiting time $t_{w0}$. The corresponding relaxation curve is the master curve, $G_{master}(t) = G(t, t_{w0}) = F(t/t_{w0}^{\\mu})$. A curve measured at a different waiting time $t_w$ is given by $G(t, t_w) = F(t/t_w^{\\mu})$.\nTo superpose the curve at $t_w$ onto the reference curve at $t_{w0}$, we must find a horizontal shift factor $a(t_w; t_{w0})$ such that when we rescale the time axis for the $t_w$ data by this factor, it matches the master curve. That is, we require the following equality to hold for all measurement times $t$:\n$$\nG(t, t_w) = G_{master}\\left(\\frac{t}{a(t_w; t_{w0})}\\right) = G\\left(\\frac{t}{a(t_w; t_{w0})}, t_{w0}\\right)\n$$\nUsing the functional form derived in part 1):\n$$\nF\\left(\\frac{t}{t_w^{\\mu}}\\right) = F\\left(\\frac{t/a(t_w; t_{w0})}{t_{w0}^{\\mu}}\\right)\n$$\nAssuming $F$ is a non-trivial function, this equality requires that its arguments are identical:\n$$\n\\frac{t}{t_w^{\\mu}} = \\frac{t}{a(t_w; t_{w0}) \\cdot t_{w0}^{\\mu}}\n$$\nSolving for the shift factor $a(t_w; t_{w0})$ yields:\n$$\na(t_w; t_{w0}) = \\frac{t_w^{\\mu}}{t_{w0}^{\\mu}} = \\left(\\frac{t_w}{t_{w0}}\\right)^{\\mu}\n$$\nThis is the scaling law for the horizontal shift factor. To determine the aging exponent $\\mu$, we can take the logarithm of this equation (any base works, but base 10 is common in practice):\n$$\n\\log_{10}\\left(a(t_w; t_{w0})\\right) = \\mu \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{t_w}{t_{w0}}\\right)\n$$\nFrom this, one can determine $\\mu$ in two ways from experimental data:\ni) From a plot of $\\log_{10}(a)$ versus $\\log_{10}(t_w)$ for a fixed $t_{w0}$, the slope of the resulting straight line is $\\mu$.\nii) From a single measurement of a shift factor $a$ for a given $t_w$ and $t_{w0}$, one can compute $\\mu$ directly by rearranging the formula:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{\\log_{10}(a(t_w; t_{w0}))}{\\log_{10}(t_w/t_{w0})}\n$$\nIf two measurements $(t_{w1}, a_1)$ and $(t_{w2}, a_2)$ are available, where $a_i = a(t_{wi}; t_{w0})$, one can compute the slope:\n$\\mu = \\frac{\\log_{10}(a_2) - \\log_{10}(a_1)}{\\log_{10}(t_{w2}) - \\log_{10}(t_{w1})} = \\frac{\\log_{10}(a_2/a_1)}{\\log_{10}(t_{w2}/t_{w1})}$.\n\n**3) Calculation of the aging exponent $\\mu$**\n\nWe are given the following experimental values:\n- Reference waiting time: $t_{w0} = 10^{3}$ s\n- A different waiting time: $t_w = 10^{5}$ s\n- The corresponding horizontal shift factor: $a(t_w; t_{w0}) = 10$\n\nWe use the formula derived in part 2) for a single measurement:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{\\log_{10}(a(t_w; t_{w0}))}{\\log_{10}(t_w/t_{w0})}\n$$\nFirst, we compute the numerator:\n$$\n\\log_{10}(a(t_w; t_{w0})) = \\log_{10}(10) = 1\n$$\nNext, we compute the denominator:\n$$\n\\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{t_w}{t_{w0}}\\right) = \\log_{10}\\left(\\frac{10^{5}\\,\\text{s}}{10^{3}\\,\\text{s}}\\right) = \\log_{10}(10^{2}) = 2\n$$\nSubstituting these values back into the expression for $\\mu$:\n$$\n\\mu = \\frac{1}{2} = 0.5\n$$\nThe aging exponent is $\\mu = 0.5$.

The validity of any proposed protocol must be judged against the provided first principles of rheometry and soft matter physics.\n\nA rigorous protocol must satisfy several key requirements:\n1.  It must ensure that the stress field driving the flow is as uniform as possible, so that the coexistence of different shear rates can be unambiguously attributed to the material's constitutive response at a well-defined stress. The problem states that a narrow-gap concentric-cylinder (Couette) geometry, where the gap $h$ is much smaller than the radius $R$ (i.e., $h/R \\ll 1$), achieves an approximately uniform shear stress $\\sigma$.\n2.  It must directly address the problem of wall slip. Since the material is known to slip, a reliable protocol must either suppress slip or be able to quantify its contribution to the flow. Slip is suppressed by using rough walls with an asperity size $a$ much larger than the slip length $b$ ($a \\gg b$). Slip is diagnosed and quantified by measuring the velocity profile with smooth walls for different gap sizes $h$, as slip effects typically scale with $1/h$.\n3.  It must perform measurements in a true steady state. Soft glassy materials often have very long relaxation times $\\tau_{\\alpha}$ and exhibit physical aging. Measurements must be taken only after waiting for a time significantly longer than $\\tau_{\\alpha}$ to ensure that observed inhomogeneities are features of the steady-state flow, not transients.\n4.

First, it uses smooth surfaces for a material known to slip, and the assumption that slip is negligible in a cone-and-plate geometry is generally incorrect and must be tested, not assumed. Second, it lacks local velocimetry, making it impossible to distinguish the macroscopic signature of banding (a stress plateau) from that of slip. Third, it advocates for \"rapid\" sweeps and minimizing measurement time, which directly contradicts the principle of waiting for long times $\\gg \\tau_{\\alpha}$ to achieve steady state. This approach is guaranteed to conflate transient effects, aging, and slip with the phenomenon under investigation.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**C. Use a roughened vane-in-cup fixture in oscillatory shear to avoid slip at the vane. Infer shear banding from distorted Lissajous figures in large-amplitude oscillatory shear, without measuring local velocity fields or varying the gap. Assume that roughness at the vane alone eliminates slip-related artefacts.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This protocol is inappropriate for the stated objective. The problem concerns steady-state shear banding, but this protocol proposes using oscillatory shear. While LAOS is a powerful technique, inferring steady-state banding from Lissajous figures is highly indirect and non-trivial. The assumption that a vane fixture completely eliminates slip artifacts is questionable, as slip can still occur at the outer (cup) wall, which is typically smooth. Most critically, like option B, it fails to incorporate local velocimetry, which is essential for a direct and unambiguous diagnosis.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\n**D. Use a concentric-cylinder geometry with a rough inner cylinder and smooth outer cup, operate under rapid rate-controlled sweeps, and measure a single-point velocity at mid-gap to infer inhomogeneity. Do not vary gap or boundary conditions. Attribute any deviation from a linear profile inferred from the mid-gap point to shear banding without testing for wall velocity discontinuities or lever-rule consistency.**\n\n- **Analysis:** This protocol is also deeply flawed. The use of \"rapid rate-controlled sweeps\" introduces transient effects. The asymmetric boundary conditions (rough inner, smooth outer) do not fully suppress slip, as it can still occur at the outer wall. Measuring velocity at only a single point in the gap is wholly insufficient to reconstruct the shape of the velocity profile; one cannot distinguish true banding from partial slip or other inhomogeneities. Attributing any nonlinearity to shear banding without testing for slip at the walls or verifying the lever rule constitutes poor scientific reasoning.\n- **Verdict:** **Incorrect**.\n\nIn conclusion, Option A is the only protocol that is scientifically rigorous, comprehensive, and consistent with all the stated first principles for unambiguously discriminating true shear banding from its experimental mimics.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2918292"}]}
