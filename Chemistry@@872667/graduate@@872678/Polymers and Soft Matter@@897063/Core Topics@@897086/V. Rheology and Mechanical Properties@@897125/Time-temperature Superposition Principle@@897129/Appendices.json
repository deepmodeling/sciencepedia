The amount of horizontal shift on a logarithmic time/frequency axis is given by the shift factor $a_T$.\n\nThe Williams-Landel-Ferry (WLF) equation is a widely used empirical model that describes the temperature dependence of the shift factor, particularly for amorphous polymers near their glass transition temperature, $T_g$.

For $T = 393.15\\ \\mathrm{K}$:\n    The temperature difference is $T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 393.15 - 373.15 = 20\\ \\mathrm{K}$.\n    $$\n    \\log_{10}(a_{T}(393.15\\ \\mathrm{K})) = -\\frac{17.44 \\cdot 20}{51.6 + 20} = -\\frac{348.8}{71.6} \\approx -4.8715\n    $$\n    Thus, $a_{T}(393.15\\ \\mathrm{K}) = 10^{-4.8715} \\approx 1.344 \\times 10^{-5}$.\n\n3.

First, we convert the application timescale $\\tau_{\\mathrm{app}}$ at temperature $T_{\\mathrm{app}}$ into a characteristic frequency $f_{\\mathrm{app}}$ at the same temperature, using the given relationship $f_c = 1/(2\\pi\\tau)$.\n    $$\n    f_{\\mathrm{app}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi \\tau_{\\mathrm{app}}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi (1.0 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\mathrm{s})}\n    $$\n\n2.

The required shift factor, $a_{T}(393.15\\ \\mathrm{K})$, was calculated in Task 1.\n\n3.  Third, we need to find the experimental frequency, which we call $f_{\\min}$, at a different temperature $T_{\\mathrm{test}} = 433.15\\ \\mathrm{K}$ that maps to the same reduced frequency $f_{\\mathrm{red, app}}$.\n    $$\n    f_{\\mathrm{red, app}} = a_{T}(T_{\\mathrm{test}}) \\cdot f_{\\min}\n    $$\n    This is the lowest frequency limit required by the DMA instrument for this measurement.

First, we must establish the precise meaning of thermorheological simplicity.\n\nA material is designated thermorheologically simple if the effect of a change in temperature from a reference temperature $T_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ to a temperature $T$ is equivalent to a uniform scaling of all characteristic relaxation (or retardation) times by a single, time-independent factor $a_T(T)$. This implies that the shape of the relaxation time spectrum, $H(\\tau)$, on a logarithmic time scale remains unchanged. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n$$\nH_T(\\tau) = b_T H_{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}(\\tau/a_T)\n$$\nHere, $a_T$ is the horizontal (time/frequency) shift factor, and $b_T$ is the vertical (modulus) shift factor. Both $a_T$ and $b_T$ must be functions of temperature $T$ only, and must not depend on the relaxation time $\\tau$ or, equivalently, on the experimental frequency $\\omega$.\n\nFrom this fundamental premise, we derive the scaling relations for all linear viscoelastic functions. For the dynamic moduli $G'(\\omega,T)$ and $G''(\\omega,T)$, the relations are:\n$$\nG'(\\omega, T) = b_T G'_{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}(\\omega a_T)\n$$\n$$\nG''(\\omega, T) = b_T G''_{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}(\\omega a_T)\n$$\nIt follows that the same factors $a_T$ and $b_T$ must successfully superpose both the storage and loss moduli. For the loss tangent, $\\tan\\delta = G''/G'$, the vertical factor $b_T$ cancels:\n$$\n\\tan\\delta(\\omega, T) = \\frac{b_T G''_{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}(\\omega a_T)}{b_T G'_{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}(\\omega a_T)} = \\tan\\delta_{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}(\\omega a_T)\n$$\nThis implies that the curve of $\\tan\\delta$ versus $\\log\\omega$ must shift horizontally without any change in shape, height, or width. For creep compliance $J(t,T)$, the relation is:\n$$\nJ(t, T) = \\frac{1}{b_T} J_{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}(t/a_T)\n$$\nA failure of TTSP, or thermorheological complexity, occurs when any of these conditions are violated.

The optimal horizontal shift factor required to overlay $G'(\\omega,T)$ differs from that required to overlay $G''(\\omega,T)$ at the same $T$.**\nAs derived from the fundamental premise, a single, unique shift factor $a_T$ must apply to all viscoelastic functions. If different shift factors are required for $G'$ and $G''$, it means that the relationship between viscous and elastic responses changes with temperature, which implies a change in the shape of the relaxation spectrum. This is a direct violation of thermorheological simplicity.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. The horizontal shift factor that overlays $G'(\\omega,T)$ at a given $T$ depends on $\\omega$ over the experimental window, i.e., an $a_T(\\omega)$ is needed to collapse the curves.**\nThe shift factor $a_T$ arises from a uniform scaling of all relaxation times. If the required shift is frequency-dependent, i.e., $a_T=a_T(\\omega)$, it signifies that different relaxation modes (probed at different frequencies) are affected differently by temperature. This is a classic indication of thermorheological complexity, as the shape of the spectrum is not preserved under a temperature change.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. After optimal horizontal shifting, the position of the main $\\tan\\delta$ peak can be aligned across $T$, but its peak height or width varies systematically with $T$.**\nThe relation $\\tan\\delta(\\omega, T) = \\tan\\delta_{T_{\\mathrm{ref}}}(\\omega a_T)$ dictates that the $\\tan\\delta$ curve must shift along the logarithmic frequency axis without any change in shape. A change in peak height or width is a direct manifestation of a change in curve shape, indicating that the relative contributions of $G'$ and $G''$ are not preserved after shifting. This is a clear failure of TTSP.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. A vertical shift factor $b_T$ is required to overlay $G'(\\omega,T)$, but the optimal $b_T$ is frequency-dependent, or the $b_T$ that overlays $G'$ differs from that for $G''$.**\nThe vertical shift factor $b_T$ must be independent of frequency. If it is found to be frequency-dependent, $b_T(\\omega)$, or if different factors are needed for $G'$ and $G''$, it implies that the modulus is not scaling uniformly with temperature, a clear violation of the simple scaling hypothesis of TTSP.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**F. Master curves constructed using different reference temperatures $T_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ are not mutually identical in shape; aligning one master curve to another requires additional stretching along $\\log \\omega$ by a factor that depends on position on the curve.**\nIf TTSP holds, a master curve represents the intrinsic material response. Changing the reference temperature should only result in a simple shift of the master curve along the logarithmic frequency axis to align it with a master curve at another reference temperature. If \"stretching\" or a non-uniform, position-dependent shift is required, it proves that the shifting procedure is not self-consistent and the shape of the response function is changing with temperature. This is a signature of failure.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**G. In a temperature window that spans the glass transition $T_g$ and includes a secondary $\\beta$ relaxation, the reduced spectra cannot be collapsed because the relative prominence of the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ processes changes with $T$.**\nThe primary ($\\alpha$) and secondary ($\\beta$) relaxation processes typically have different activation energies and thus different temperature dependencies for their characteristic times. For example, the $\\alpha$-process often follows a Williams–Landel–Ferry (WLF) dependence while a $\\beta$-process follows an Arrhenius dependence. A single shift factor $a_T(T)$ cannot simultaneously superpose two processes with different temperature dependencies. This leads to a failure of superposition and is a well-known example of thermorheological complexity.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**H. Shift factors extracted from the peak frequencies of $\\tan\\delta(\\omega,T)$ follow a single Williams–Landel–Ferry (WLF) relation near $T_g$ with a unique parameter set that also overlays $G'$, $G''$, and creep compliance.**\nThis observation describes a system that perfectly adheres to the TTSP. A single set of shift factors, described by a physically meaningful model (WLF), successfully superposes data from multiple, independent experimental measurements ($G'$, $G''$, $J(t)$, $\\tan\\delta$). This is a confirmation of thermorheological simplicity, not a signature of its failure.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**I. Isothermal creep compliance curves $J(t,T)$ versus $\\log t$ at different $T$ are not parallel in the retardation regime; their slopes vary with $T$, and no single horizontal factor $a_T$ brings them into coincidence across the same time decade.**\nSuccessful superposition of creep compliance curves requires that $J(t,T)$ versus $\\log t$ curves at different temperatures have the same shape and can be overlaid by horizontal ($a_T$) and vertical ($1/b_T$) shifts. If the curves are not parallel, their shapes are different. A variation in slope ($d \\log J / d \\log t$) means the shape of the retardation spectrum is changing with temperature, which is a direct violation of TTSP.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**J. Poor superposition in DMA is observed when the strain amplitude is increased into a weakly nonlinear regime at fixed $T$, whereas at sufficiently small strain within the verified linear range, isothermal frequency sweeps at different $T$ overlay with a single $a_T$ and constant $b_T$.**\nThe time-temperature superposition principle is a tenet of *linear* viscoelasticity. This option states that TTSP fails when the material is deformed into the *nonlinear* regime. However, it also explicitly states that TTSP holds true in the linear viscoelastic regime. The failure is due to a violation of the linearity assumption, not thermorheological simplicity. Therefore, this is not a signature that the material is thermorheologically complex in its linear response.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**K. Upon heating, an endothermic crystallization or order–disorder transition is detected by calorimetry in the same $T$ range as DMA; the dynamic spectra before and after the transition cannot be overlaid by any horizontal shift factor.**\nTTSP is predicated on the assumption that the material's microstructure is stable and does not change with temperature, apart from kinetic effects. A phase transition, such as crystallization or an order-disorder transition, represents a fundamental change in the material's microstructure and morphology. The material before and after the transition is physically different, with a drastically altered relaxation spectrum. TTSP cannot hold across such a transition. The inability to superpose data is an expected consequence and a definitive signature of TTSP failure.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{BCDEFGIK}$$", "id": "2936913"}]}
