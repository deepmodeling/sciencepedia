{"hands_on_practices": [{"introduction": "The foundation of linear viscoelasticity rests on the Boltzmann superposition principle, which elegantly connects a material's entire strain history to its current state of stress. This exercise provides fundamental practice in applying this principle to one of the most elementary yet insightful deformation histories: the step strain. By deriving the stress relaxation response, you will solidify your understanding of how a material's memory, encapsulated by the relaxation modulus $G(t)$, dictates its rheological behavior in the time domain [@problem_id:2925815].", "problem": "A polymer melt is modeled as a linear viscoelastic material with relaxation modulus represented by a Prony series,\n$$\nG(t)=\\sum_{i=1}^{N} G_{i}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{i}}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $G_{i}>0$ and $\\tau_{i}>0$ are mode moduli and relaxation times, respectively, and $t$ is time. At $t=0$, the material is subjected to a small-amplitude step shear strain $\\gamma(t)=\\gamma_{0}H(t)$, where $H(t)$ is the Heaviside step function and $\\gamma_{0}$ is a constant strain amplitude.\n\nUsing only the hereditary form of linear viscoelasticity (Boltzmann superposition principle) expressed as a convolution of the relaxation modulus with the strain rate, derive an analytic expression for the shear stress $\\sigma_{xy}(t)$ for all $t$.

No numerical evaluation is required, and your final boxed answer must be the analytic expression for $\\sigma_{xy}(t)$ only.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective. It presents a standard exercise in the field of linear viscoelasticity. We shall therefore proceed with its solution and subsequent analysis.\n\nThe fundamental constitutive equation for a linear viscoelastic material, known as the Boltzmann superposition principle, relates the shear stress $\\sigma_{xy}(t)$ to the entire history of the shear strain rate $\\dot{\\gamma}(t')$. In its hereditary integral form, it is expressed as:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xy}(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} G(t-t') \\dot{\\gamma}(t') dt'\n$$\nwhere $G(t)$ is the material's relaxation modulus.\n\nThe problem specifies a step shear strain of amplitude $\\gamma_0$ applied at time $t=0$. This is represented mathematically as:\n$$\n\\gamma(t) = \\gamma_{0}H(t)\n$$\nwhere $H(t)$ is the Heaviside step function, defined as $H(t)=0$ for $t0$ and $H(t)=1$ for $t \\ge 0$.\n\nTo use the constitutive equation, we must first compute the strain rate, $\\dot{\\gamma}(t)$. This requires the derivative of the Heaviside function. In the framework of distribution theory, the derivative of the Heaviside step function is the Dirac delta function, $\\delta(t)$:\n$$\n\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\left[ \\gamma_{0}H(t) \\right] = \\gamma_{0} \\frac{dH(t)}{dt} = \\gamma_{0}\\delta(t)\n$$\nThe Dirac delta function is a distribution defined by its action under an integral, specifically its sifting property: for a continuous function $f(t')$, the integral $\\int_{a}^{b} f(t')\\delta(t'-c)dt'$ evaluates to $f(c)$ if $c \\in (a, b)$, and to $0$ if $c \\notin [a, b]$.\n\nWe now substitute the expression for the strain rate into the Boltzmann superposition integral:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xy}(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} G(t-t') \\left[ \\gamma_{0}\\delta(t') \\right] dt' = \\gamma_{0} \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} G(t-t') \\delta(t') dt'\n$$\nTo evaluate this integral, we apply the sifting property of the $\\delta(t')$ function, which is non-zero only at $t'=0$.\nFor any time $t0$, the integration interval $(-\\infty, t)$ includes the point $t'=0$. The integral therefore evaluates to the integrand's prefactor, $G(t-t')$, at $t'=0$.\n$$\n\\sigma_{xy}(t) = \\gamma_{0} G(t-0) = \\gamma_{0} G(t) \\quad \\text{for } t  0\n$$\nFor any time $t0$, the integration interval $(-\\infty, t)$ does not include the point $t'=0$. Thus, the integral is zero.\n$$\n\\sigma_{xy}(t) = 0 \\quad \\text{for } t  0\n$$\nAt the boundary $t=0$, the stress jumps. We can combine these two cases into a single expression valid for all time $t$ by using the Heaviside function:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xy}(t) = \\gamma_{0} G(t) H(t)\n$$\nFinally, we substitute the given Prony series representation for the relaxation modulus $G(t)$:\n$$\nG(t)=\\sum_{i=1}^{N} G_{i}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{i}}\\right)\n$$\nThis yields the final analytical expression for the shear stress:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xy}(t) = \\gamma_{0} H(t) \\sum_{i=1}^{N} G_{i}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{i}}\\right)\n$$\nThis result shows that following an instantaneous imposition of strain, the stress is initially at its maximum value, $\\sigma_{xy}(0^+) = \\gamma_0 G(0) = \\gamma_0 \\sum G_i$, and then relaxes over time according to the spectrum of relaxation times $\\{\\tau_i\\}$.\n\nWe now turn to the second part of the query: the regime of validity for this linear viscoelastic result. The very term \"linear\" implies a restricted domain of applicability.\n(i) For a step strain history, the deformation is characterized by a single parameter, the strain amplitude $\\gamma_0$. The linear response theory is the leading-order approximation for small deformations. Therefore, the dimensionless parameter governing the validity of the theory is the strain amplitude itself. The condition for linearity is $\\gamma_0 \\ll 1$. For most polymeric materials, \"small\" means that $\\gamma_0$ must typically be less than $0.1-0.5$.\n\n(ii) A more rigorous justification comes from a systematic expansion of the stress functional. A general nonlinear constitutive theory for an isotropic material in simple shear can be expressed as a series of multiple hereditary integrals over the strain rate history. For the shear stress, this expansion (a form of the Green-Rivlin expansion) contains only odd powers of the strain rate due to symmetry arguments (reversing the flow direction must reverse the stress). It has the form:\n$$\n\\sigma_{xy}(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} G_1(t-t_1) \\dot{\\gamma}(t_1) dt_1 + \\iiint_{-\\infty}^{t} G_3(t-t_1, t-t_2, t-t_3) \\dot{\\gamma}(t_1)\\dot{\\gamma}(t_2)\\dot{\\gamma}(t_3) dt_1 dt_2 dt_3 + O(\\dot{\\gamma}^5)\n$$\nThe linear viscoelastic model we used, $\\sigma_{xy}(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{t} G(t-t') \\dot{\\gamma}(t') dt'$, is precisely the first term of this series, with $G(t) \\equiv G_1(t)$. For a step strain input $\\gamma(t) = \\gamma_0 H(t)$, where $\\dot{\\gamma}(t) = \\gamma_0 \\delta(t)$, the first term scales as $\\gamma_0$, the second term scales as $\\gamma_0^3$, the third as $\\gamma_0^5$, and so on. The full stress is an expansion of the form $\\sigma_{xy}(t) = C_1(t)\\gamma_0 + C_3(t)\\gamma_0^3 + \\dots$. The linear approximation is valid if and only if the contributions from higher-order terms are negligible, which is guaranteed in the limit of small strain amplitude, i.e., $\\gamma_0 \\to 0$.\n\n(iii) The criterion of small strain amplitude is sufficient for a step strain but is incomplete for other deformation histories involving a finite rate of deformation over an extended period. Consider a flow characterized by a constant shear rate $\\dot{\\gamma}$. A new dimensionless group becomes relevant, which compares the material's intrinsic timescale to the timescale of the flow. The material's timescales are its relaxation times, $\\{\\tau_i\\}$, among which the longest, $\\tau_{\\text{max}} = \\max_i(\\{\\tau_i\\})$, is often dominant. The characteristic timescale of the flow is the inverse of the shear rate, $1/\\dot{\\gamma}$. The ratio of these timescales is the Weissenberg number, $Wi$:\n$$\nWi = \\tau_{\\text{max}} \\dot{\\gamma}\n$$\nLinear viscoelasticity describes the material's response to perturbations from its equilibrium state. If the flow is rapid ($Wi \\gg 1$), the polymer chains do not have sufficient time to relax and are forced into highly-stretched, oriented, and non-equilibrium configurations. The response in this regime is inherently nonlinear (e.g., shear thinning). For the linear approximation to hold for a general flow history with a characteristic rate $\\dot{\\gamma}$, this rate must be slow enough that the material structure is only slightly perturbed. This corresponds to the condition $Wi \\ll 1$. Therefore, for arbitrary flow histories, the dual conditions of small total accumulated strain and small Weissenberg number are required to ensure the validity of linear viscoelasticity.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\gamma_{0} H(t) \\sum_{i=1}^{N} G_{i}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{t}{\\tau_{i}}\\right)}\n$$", "id": "2925815"}, {"introduction": "An ideal rheological measurement reflects only the material's properties, but in reality, the instrument itself can introduce artifacts that corrupt the data.

It is a standard problem in fluid mechanics and rheology. Therefore, we may proceed with the solution.\n\nThe problem requires an analysis of the onset of inertial effects in a cone-and-plate rheometer. The governing equation for the flow of an incompressible Newtonian fluid is the steady-state Navier–Stokes equation:\n$$\n\\rho (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{v} = -\\nabla p + \\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v}\n$$\nHere, $\\rho$ is the fluid density, $\\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity field, $p$ is the pressure, and $\\eta$ is the shear viscosity. The term on the left, $\\rho (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{v}$, represents convective inertia (the rate of change of momentum due to fluid motion), while the term $\\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v}$ represents viscous forces (the diffusion of momentum). Inertial effects contaminate viscosity measurements when the inertial term is no longer negligible compared to the viscous term.\n\nThe ratio of the magnitudes of these two terms defines a Reynolds number, $Re$. We perform an order-of-magnitude analysis to construct this number. Let $U$ be a characteristic velocity and $L$ be a characteristic length scale of the flow. The magnitude of the inertial term scales as $|\\rho (\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\nabla) \\mathbf{v}| \\sim \\rho U^2/L$, and the magnitude of the viscous term scales as $|\\eta \\nabla^2 \\mathbf{v}| \\sim \\eta U/L^2$. The Reynolds number is their ratio:\n$$\nRe = \\frac{|\\text{Inertial Term}|}{|\\text{Viscous Term}|} \\sim \\frac{\\rho U^2 / L}{\\eta U / L^2} = \\frac{\\rho U L}{\\eta}\n$$\nTo apply this to the cone-and-plate geometry, we must identify the appropriate characteristic scales. The flow is primarily a shear flow within the gap between the cone and the plate. The shear rate, $\\dot{\\gamma}$, is defined as the velocity gradient. For a small cone angle $\\alpha$, the gap height at a given radius $r$ is approximately $H(r) \\approx \\alpha r$. The shear rate is nearly uniform throughout the gap, given by $\\dot{\\gamma} \\approx \\Omega / \\alpha$, where $\\Omega$ is the angular velocity of the cone.\n\nThe problem asks for $Re$ in terms of $\\rho$, $\\eta$, $\\dot{\\gamma}$, and a characteristic gap $h$. The characteristic velocity scale, $U$, can be associated with the fluid velocity, which is driven by the shear. Across a gap of height $h$, a shear rate of $\\dot{\\gamma}$ produces a velocity difference of $\\Delta v = \\dot{\\gamma} h$. Thus, a natural choice for the characteristic velocity is $U \\sim \\dot{\\gamma} h$.\n\nThe choice of characteristic length, $L$, is critical. In this context, $L$ is the length scale over which momentum is transported. Viscous effects are associated with the diffusion of momentum across the gap, so the length scale for viscous transport is $h$. The characteristic time for momentum to diffuse across this gap is $t_{\\text{visc}} \\sim h^2/\\nu = \\rho h^2/\\eta$, where $\\nu = \\eta/\\rho$ is the kinematic viscosity. Inertial effects are associated with the convection of momentum by the flow itself. The characteristic timescale for this convective transport is determined by the shear rate, $t_{\\text{conv}} \\sim 1/\\dot{\\gamma}$.\n\nThe Reynolds number can be interpreted as the ratio of these two timescales, $Re = t_{\\text{visc}} / t_{\\text{conv}}$. A large ratio indicates that momentum diffusion is slow compared to convection, meaning inertia dominates. Substituting our timescale estimates:\n$$\nRe = \\frac{\\rho h^2 / \\eta}{1 / \\dot{\\gamma}} = \\frac{\\rho \\dot{\\gamma} h^2}{\\eta}\n$$\nThis expression conforms to the requirements of the problem. This form is derived by choosing both the characteristic velocity $U \\sim \\dot{\\gamma} h$ and the characteristic length $L \\sim h$.\n\nThe problem states that inertial effects become significant when this Reynolds number reaches a value of $1$.

Inertia and pressure gradients are negligible, so the flow is steady, laminar, and one-dimensional. A spatially resolved velocimetry measurement provides the velocity profile $v_x(y)$ across the gap. The instrument reports the apparent shear rate $\\dot{\\gamma}_{\\mathrm{app}}=V/H$.\n\nTwo hypotheses are proposed to explain observed deviations from a perfectly linear profile:\n\n(i) Shear banding in the bulk due to a non-monotonic stress–shear-rate constitutive response, leading to coexistence of regions with distinct local shear rates at a common shear stress.\n\n(ii) Wall slip at one or both plates, due to a finite slip length at the fluid–solid boundary, while the bulk remains homogeneous.\n\nFrom fundamental balances and boundary conditions, decide which option correctly describes how to distinguish hypothesis (i) from hypothesis (ii) using spatially resolved velocity profiles, and outlines the expected $v_x(y)$ profiles and at least one additional discriminating experimental protocol.\n\nA. In shear banding, $v_x(y)$ is nearly flat in the center and has thin, very steep layers adjacent to both walls; the profile has no sharp internal change of slope, and the fluid velocity at both walls differs from the plate velocities. In wall slip, $v_x(y)$ shows two linear segments with a sharp kink in the bulk at $y=y^\\ast$, where the slope changes discontinuously; the fluid velocity always matches the plate velocities at $y=0$ and $y=H$. Varying the gap $H$ at fixed $\\dot{\\gamma}_{\\mathrm{app}}$ does not change the normalized profile shape in wall slip but does in shear banding.\n\nB. In shear banding, the shear stress is uniform across $y$ and two bands with distinct constant local shear rates coexist, producing a piecewise-linear $v_x(y)$ with a sharp internal interface at $y=y^\\ast$ where $\\mathrm{d}v_x/\\mathrm{d}y$ jumps; with no-slip boundaries the fluid velocity matches the plate velocities at $y=0$ and $y=H$. The fraction of the high-shear band increases with $\\dot{\\gamma}_{\\mathrm{app}}$, while the local slopes in each band remain approximately fixed over a stress plateau. In wall slip, the bulk is homogeneous, so $v_x(y)$ is a single straight line (constant slope) across the gap, but with finite offsets at one or both walls such that the fluid velocity at the wall does not equal the plate velocity; there is no sharp internal kink. Roughening the walls suppresses slip-induced offsets but does not eliminate a bulk kink from shear banding. At fixed $\\dot{\\gamma}_{\\mathrm{app}}$, changing $H$ leaves the normalized banded profile unchanged (same two slopes and interface position as a fraction of $H$), whereas slip-dominated profiles change with $H$ because the ratio of wall-offset to bulk drop depends on $H$.\n\nC.

There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived from first principles.\n\n### Derivation and Analysis\nThe momentum balance for this flow, under the given assumptions, simplifies to $\\frac{d\\tau_{yx}}{dy} = 0$. This implies that the shear stress, $\\tau_{yx}$, is uniform across the gap, i.e., $\\tau_{yx}(y) = \\tau_w$ for all $y \\in [0, H]$. The local shear rate is defined as $\\dot{\\gamma}(y) = \\frac{dv_x}{dy}$. The relationship between stress and shear rate is given by the material's constitutive equation, $\\tau_{yx} = f(\\dot{\\gamma})$.\n\n**Hypothesis (i): Shear Banding**\nShear banding occurs if the constitutive curve $\\tau(\\dot{\\gamma})$ is non-monotonic, exhibiting a region where stress decreases with increasing shear rate. This allows two different shear rates, a low shear rate $\\dot{\\gamma}_1$ and a high shear rate $\\dot{\\gamma}_2$, to coexist at the same shear stress $\\tau_w$ (the stress plateau value).\n-   **Velocity Profile**: Since $\\tau_w$ is constant across the gap, the fluid can separate into two distinct bands, each with a constant shear rate. Let the low-shear band ($\\dot{\\gamma}_1$) occupy the region from $y=0$ to $y=y^\\ast$ and the high-shear band ($\\dot{\\gamma}_2$) occupy the region from $y=y^\\ast$ to $y=H$. The velocity profile $v_x(y)$ will be piecewise linear:\n    $$ v_x(y) = \\begin{cases} \\dot{\\gamma}_1 y + v_x(0)  0 \\le y \\le y^\\ast \\\\ \\dot{\\gamma}_2 (y-y^\\ast) + v_x(y^\\ast)  y^\\ast  y \\le H \\end{cases} $$\n    This profile has a \"kink\" at the interface $y=y^\\ast$, where the slope $\\frac{dv_x}{dy}$ jumps discontinuously from $\\dot{\\gamma}_1$ to $\\dot{\\gamma}_2$.\n-   **Boundary Conditions**: To isolate the bulk phenomenon, it is standard to assume no-slip boundary conditions, so $v_x(0) = 0$ and $v_x(H) = V$.\n-   **Lever Rule**: The total velocity is $V = \\dot{\\gamma}_1 y^\\ast + \\dot{\\gamma}_2 (H-y^\\ast)$. The apparent shear rate is $\\dot{\\gamma}_{\\mathrm{app}} = \\frac{V}{H} = \\frac{y^\\ast}{H}\\dot{\\gamma}_1 + (1-\\frac{y^\\ast}{H})\\dot{\\gamma}_2$. As one increases $\\dot{\\gamma}_{\\mathrm{app}}$ (by increasing $V$), the fraction of the gap occupied by the high-shear band, $(1 - y^\\ast/H)$, increases, while $\\dot{\\gamma}_1$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}_2$ remain fixed at the values corresponding to the stress plateau.\n-   **Experimental Tests**:\n    1.  **Surface Roughness**: Shear banding is a bulk fluid property. Roughening the plate surfaces, a method to suppress wall slip, should not eliminate shear banding.\n    2.  **Gap Variation ($H$)**: According to the lever rule, if $\\dot{\\gamma}_{\\mathrm{app}}$ is held constant, the fractional position of the interface, $y^\\ast/H$, must also remain constant (assuming $\\dot{\\gamma}_1$ and $\\dot{\\gamma}_2$ are material constants on the stress plateau). Therefore, the normalized velocity profile $v_x(y/H)$ should be independent of $H$.\n\n**Hypothesis (ii): Wall Slip**\nWall slip occurs when the no-slip boundary condition fails. The bulk fluid is assumed to be homogeneous, meaning its constitutive response $\\tau(\\dot{\\gamma})$ is monotonic.\n-   **Velocity Profile**: With a homogeneous bulk and constant stress $\\tau_w$, the local shear rate $\\dot{\\gamma}_b = \\frac{dv_x}{dy}$ must be constant across the entire gap. This results in a single linear velocity profile in the bulk. However, the fluid velocity at the walls does not match the wall velocities. There is a slip velocity at the bottom wall, $v_{s,0} = v_x(0) - 0$, and at the top wall, $v_{s,H} = V - v_x(H)$. The profile is thus:\n    $$ v_x(y) = v_{s,0} + \\dot{\\gamma}_b y $$\n    This is a straight line across the bulk, with no internal kink. The velocity profile shows apparent discontinuities at the boundaries, $y=0$ and $y=H$.\n-   **Experimental Tests**:\n    1.  **Surface Roughness**: Wall slip is an interfacial phenomenon, highly dependent on the surface chemistry and topography of the walls. Roughening the surfaces generally increases friction and suppresses or eliminates slip. Observing that the phenomenon disappears with rough walls is strong evidence for slip.\n    2.  **Gap Variation ($H$)**: The total velocity of the top plate is given by $V = v_{s,0} + \\dot{\\gamma}_b H + v_{s,H}$. The apparent shear rate is $\\dot{\\gamma}_{\\mathrm{app}} = \\frac{V}{H} = \\frac{v_{s,0} + v_{s,H}}{H} + \\dot{\\gamma}_b$. The slip velocities and the bulk shear rate are functions of the wall stress, $\\tau_w$. If one performs experiments at constant $\\tau_w$ while varying $H$, a plot of $\\dot{\\gamma}_{\\mathrm{app}}$ versus $1/H$ (a Mooney plot) will be linear. This indicates that the apparent rheology is strongly dependent on $H$. The normalized profile shape is not invariant with $H$.\n\n### Option-by-Option Evaluation\n\n**A.** This option incorrectly describes both phenomena. It attributes the characteristics of shear banding (a kinked profile) to wall slip and vice versa. It states there is no sharp change of slope in shear banding, which is false. It claims fluid velocity matches plate velocities for wall slip, which is the definition of no-slip. It also incorrectly states the dependence on gap size $H$. **Incorrect**.\n\n**B.** This option correctly describes the key features of both hypotheses. For shear banding, it correctly identifies the uniform stress, the coexistence of two bands leading to a piecewise-linear profile with a kink, the adherence to no-slip boundaries (in the idealized case), and the lever rule dynamics. For wall slip, it correctly identifies the homogeneous bulk, the single linear profile, the velocity offsets at the walls, and the absence of an internal kink. It also correctly identifies two key experimental discriminators: (1) roughening walls suppresses slip but not banding, and (2) it correctly outlines the different dependencies on gap size $H$ (normalized banded profiles can be invariant, while slip profiles are not). **Correct**.\n\n**C.** This option is incorrect on multiple grounds. It claims both phenomena produce curved profiles with continuous slopes, which is false for the given geometry. Shear banding has a discontinuous slope, and both phenomena lead to linear or piecewise-linear profiles. It falsely claims that spatially resolved velocimetry cannot distinguish the two and that surface roughness has no effect. **Incorrect**.\n\n**D.** This option provides a flawed description of both phenomena. It incorrectly describes the shear banding profile as \"smoothly curved\". It incorrectly describes the wall slip profile as \"flat (plug flow)\" with the velocity drop at a \"single internal interface\", which is nonsensical. It also incorrectly states that slip is a \"bulk phenomenon\" unaffected by wall roughness. **Incorrect**.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2925803"}]}
