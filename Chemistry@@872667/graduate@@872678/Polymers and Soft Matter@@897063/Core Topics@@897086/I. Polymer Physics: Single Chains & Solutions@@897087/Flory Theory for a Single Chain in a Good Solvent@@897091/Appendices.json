The problem states diameter $a$, so this term is the volume of a sphere of radius $a/2$, which is `4/3 * pi * (a/2)^3 = pi*a^3/6`.  Let's re-read carefully. \"monomers of hard-sphere diameter $a$\". Okay, the calculation is done for radius `a`, not diameter. This is a very common ambiguity. However, the calculation in the original solution `∫_0^a ... = 4/3 π a³` treats `a` as the radius of the hard core. And the entire rest of the problem (`a = r = a(1+λ)`) also treats `a` as a radius. I will assume `a` is the hard-sphere *radius*, despite the text saying \"diameter\". This inconsistency is subtle. To be minimalist, I will follow the original solution's interpretation of `a` as radius, as changing it would require re-deriving the entire solution and answer. The problem text \"monomers of hard-sphere diameter $a$\" is inconsistent with its own formula `0 = r  a` where `r` is center-to-center distance and `a` is the hard-core contact distance (radius). A better phrasing would be \"monomers with hard-core radius `a`\" or \"monomers of diameter `2a`\". I will assume `a` is radius, as the math in the solution does.\n\nWait, if `r` is center-to-center distance, then for two spheres of diameter `a` (radius `a/2`), they cannot get closer than `r=a`. So `U(r) = ∞` for `r  a`. In this case, `a` is the diameter. The volume of exclusion is then `4/3 π a³`. Yes, this is correct. So `a` is the diameter, but the volume of exclusion corresponds to a sphere of radius `a`. This is the standard definition of the second virial coefficient for hard spheres. Okay, no error here.

The problem is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and objective, and therefore is deemed valid.\n\nThe Flory theory approximates the total Helmholtz free energy, $F(R)$, of a polymer coil of size $R$ as the sum of two competing contributions: an entropic elastic term, $F_{el}(R)$, and a monomer-monomer interaction term, $F_{int}(R)$.\n$$F(R) = F_{el}(R) + F_{int}(R)$$\n\nFirst, we establish the form of the elastic free energy, $F_{el}(R)$. This term quantifies the entropic cost of deforming the polymer chain from its ideal, unperturbed dimensions. For an ideal Gaussian chain consisting of $N$ Kuhn segments of length $a$, the mean-square end-to-end distance is $\\langle R_0^2 \\rangle = N a^2$. The free energy associated with stretching the chain to a size $R$ is predominantly entropic and, for a Gaussian chain model, is quadratic in the deformation. It can be expressed as:\n$$F_{el}(R) = C_{el} k_B T \\frac{R^2}{N a^2}$$\nHere, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $C_{el}$ is a numerical constant of order unity (often taken as $3/2$). This term represents an energetic penalty for expanding the coil ($R  R_0$) and acts as an effective spring, providing a restoring force that favors a more compact conformation.\n\nSecond, we determine the interaction free energy, $F_{int}(R)$. This term accounts for the repulsive interactions between monomers in a good solvent, which cause the chain to swell. The problem specifies a description at the level of the second virial approximation. The interaction energy density in a system of particles at concentration $\\rho$ is proportional to $v \\rho^2$, where $v$ is the second virial coefficient, or the excluded volume parameter. We assume the polymer coil is a sphere of radius $R$ containing $N$ monomers distributed with a uniform concentration:\n$$\\rho = \\frac{N}{V} \\sim \\frac{N}{R^3}$$\nwhere we have approximated the volume $V$ of the coil as being proportional to $R^3$.

The free energy is expressed in units of thermal energy, $k_B T$.\n\nThe entropic term, $F_{el}$, describes the free energy cost of stretching the chain.
