This exercise challenges you to apply scaling theory to a semidilute solution in a theta solvent, a special condition where attractive and repulsive forces between segments perfectly balance.

Let $c_m$ denote the monomer number concentration (monomers per unit volume). The solution is in the semidilute, unentangled regime, where many chains overlap but $a^3 c_m \\ll 1$. Starting only from fundamental definitions and well-tested facts of polymer physics (single-chain statistics under theta conditions, the existence of a correlation length in semidilute solutions, virial ideas for the free energy density, and the thermodynamic definition of osmotic pressure), derive the leading-order concentration dependence of the osmotic pressure $\\Pi$ as a function of $c_m$ for this theta-solvent semidilute solution.

It presents a standard, solvable problem in the scaling theory of polymer solutions. We may proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe system is a semidilute solution of flexible polymer chains in a theta solvent. In the semidilute regime, defined by the monomer concentration $c_m$ being above the overlap concentration $c_m^*$, the chains overlap significantly. This complex many-body system can be simplified using a scaling approach, pioneered by de Gennes. The central idea is that on length scales smaller than a characteristic correlation length $\\xi$, a chain segment does not interact with other chains and thus exhibits single-chain statistics. On scales larger than $\\xi$, the solution is homogeneous, and the details of individual chains are screened out. The length $\\xi$ can be visualized as the average mesh size of the transient network formed by the entangled polymers.\n\nThe derivation proceeds in three steps as requested.\n\nFirst, we establish the relationship between the correlation length $\\xi$ and the monomer concentration $c_m$.\nLet us consider a \"blob\" of size $\\xi$. A chain segment that fits within this blob consists of $g$ monomers of size $a$. Since the chain conformation is unperturbed inside the blob, it follows the statistics of an isolated chain in the given solvent. For a theta solvent, the polymer is described by an ideal random walk model. The end-to-end distance $R$ for a chain of $N$ segments scales as $R \\sim a N^{1/2}$. Applying this to our blob of size $\\xi$ containing $g$ monomers, we have:\n$$\n\\xi \\approx a g^{1/2}\n$$\nThis implies that the number of monomers per blob is $g \\approx (\\xi/a)^2$.\n\nThe second piece of information comes from a self-consistency condition. The blob model is valid if the local monomer concentration inside a blob is, on average, equal to the overall macroscopic monomer concentration $c_m$ of the solution. The volume of a blob is $\\xi^3$. The monomer concentration within a blob is therefore $g/\\xi^3$. Setting this equal to the bulk concentration $c_m$ yields:\n$$\nc_m \\approx \\frac{g}{\\xi^3}\n$$\nWe now have a system of two equations for the two unknowns $\\xi$ and $g$. We can eliminate $g$ to find how $\\xi$ depends on $c_m$. Substituting $g \\approx (\\xi/a)^2$ into the concentration relation gives:\n$$\nc_m \\approx \\frac{(\\xi/a)^2}{\\xi^3} = \\frac{1}{a^2 \\xi}\n$$\nSolving for the correlation length $\\xi$, we find its scaling with monomer concentration:\n$$\n\\xi \\approx \\frac{1}{a^2 c_m}\n$$\nThis result shows that as the solution becomes more concentrated (increasing $c_m$), the mesh size $\\xi$ of the polymer network decreases, as expected.\n\nSecond, we relate the free energy density of the solution to $\\xi$ and thence to the osmotic pressure $\\Pi$. In the semidilute regime, the osmotic pressure arises from the interactions between polymer segments. In the blob model, the solution is pictured as a space-filling packing of blobs of size $\\xi$. The dominant contribution to the free energy comes from the entropy loss due to confinement or, equivalently, from the interactions between blobs. The density of these blobs is approximately $1/\\xi^3$. Each blob, representing a degree of freedom or an elementary interacting unit, contributes an energy on the order of the thermal energy, $k_B T$. Therefore, the free energy per unit volume, $f$, scales as the density of blobs multiplied by the thermal energy per blob:\n$$\nf \\approx \\frac{k_B T}{\\xi^3}\n$$\nThe osmotic pressure $\\Pi$ is the thermodynamic quantity that has the same units and scaling as the free energy density. Formally, for a solution, $\\Pi = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial V}\\right)_{T,N_{polymers}}$, and scaling arguments show that $\\Pi$ scales directly with $f$. Thus, we have:\n$$\n\\Pi \\approx \\frac{k_B T}{\\xi^3}\n$$\n\nThird, we combine these results to obtain the final expression for $\\Pi$ as a function of $c_m$. By substituting the expression for $\\xi$ from our first step into the expression for $\\Pi$, we get:\n$$\n\\Pi \\approx k_B T \\left( \\frac{1}{\\xi} \\right)^3 \\approx k_B T (a^2 c_m)^3 = k_B T a^6 c_m^3\n$$\nTo present this in the requested form, we identify the dimensionless monomer concentration as $\\phi_m = a^3 c_m$. We can then rewrite the scaling law for $\\Pi$ as:\n$$\n\\Pi \\approx k_B T a^{-3} (a^9 c_m^3) = k_B T a^{-3} (a^3 c_m)^3\n$$\nThis is a scaling relationship, meaning it is accurate up to a numerical prefactor of order unity, which is ignored in this type of analysis.\n\nFinally, we interpret this result by comparing it to the case of a good solvent. In a good solvent, repulsive excluded-volume interactions cause the chain to swell. Its size scales as $R \\sim a N^{\\nu}$ with the Flory exponent $\\nu \\approx 3/5$ (in $3$ dimensions). A similar scaling analysis for a good solvent yields $\\Pi \\sim c_m^{9/4}$.\nComparing the two results:\n- Theta solvent: $\\Pi \\sim c_m^3$.\n- Good solvent: $\\Pi \\sim c_m^{9/4} \\approx c_m^{2.25}$.\n\nThe concentration dependence of the osmotic pressure is stronger in a theta solvent than in a good solvent for the semidilute regime ($3 > 9/4$). The physical reason for this lies in the nature of the dominant interactions. A theta solvent is defined as a solvent in which the second virial coefficient $A_2$, which quantifies effective two-body interactions between chains, is zero. At low concentrations in the dilute regime, the chains behave ideally. However, in the semidilute regime, chains are forced to interact. Since pair interactions are screened on average, the leading contribution to the interaction free energy, and thus to the osmotic pressure, comes from three-body collisions. A term representing three-body interactions in a virial-like expansion for the free energy would be proportional to the cube of the concentration, $c_m^3$, which is precisely the scaling we derived. In contrast, for a good solvent, $A_2 > 0$, and repulsive two-body interactions are dominant. The scaling $\\Pi \\sim c_m^{9/4}$ reflects the physics of these screened two-body repulsions on a fractal structure (the polymer network), resulting in a weaker concentration dependence than the $c_m^3$ law for three-body interactions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{k_B T a^{-3} (a^3 c_m)^3}$$", "id": "2909896"}, {"introduction": "The way a polymer chain moves through a solvent changes dramatically as concentration increases and chains begin to overlap.

The total occupied volume is dominated by the largest chains in the distribution, because the volume of a single coil scales as $R_{g}^{3} \\propto M^{3\\nu}$. Since the Flory exponent $\\nu$ is greater than $1/3$ (for example, $\\nu \\approx 0.588$ in a good solvent, so $3\\nu \\approx 1.764$), this is a strong dependence.\nBy Jensen's inequality for the convex function $f(x)=x^{3\\nu}$, we have $\\langle M^{3\\nu} \\rangle_{n} \\ge (M_{n})^{3\\nu}$. The equality holds only for the monodisperse case. For any polydisperse system, $\\langle M^{3\\nu} \\rangle_{n} > (M_{n})^{3\\nu}$. Consequently, for a polydisperse solution with number-average molecular weight $M_n$, the overlap concentration $c_{\\mathrm{eff}}^{*}$ will be lower than that of a monodisperse solution of molecular weight $M_w = M_n$.
