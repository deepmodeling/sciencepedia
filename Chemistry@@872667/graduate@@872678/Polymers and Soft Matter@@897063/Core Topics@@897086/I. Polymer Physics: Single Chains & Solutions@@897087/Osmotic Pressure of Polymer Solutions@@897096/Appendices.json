In these cases, the overall osmotic pressure includes a significant contribution from the uneven distribution of small mobile ions across a semipermeable membrane, a phenomenon known as the Donnan effect. This problem guides you through the calculation of this ionic contribution, called the Donnan pressure, by combining the principles of thermodynamic equilibrium with the constraint of electroneutrality, providing a core exercise in the physical chemistry of charged macromolecules [@problem_id:172835].", "problem": "Consider a system at thermal equilibrium at temperature $T$. A dilute solution of a strong polyelectrolyte is separated from a salt reservoir by a semipermeable membrane. The membrane is permeable to the solvent and small ions but impermeable to the large polyelectrolyte chains.\n\nThe polyelectrolyte solution (the \"inside\" compartment) contains negatively charged polymer chains. The number concentration of monomers is $c_m$, and each monomer carries an effective charge of $-Ze$, where $Z$ is a positive dimensionless number. The total concentration of fixed negative charges on the polymers is therefore $Zc_m$. To maintain charge neutrality, the solution also contains an equivalent concentration, $Zc_m$, of monovalent positive counter-ions that originate from the polymer.\n\nThe salt reservoir (the \"outside\" compartment) contains a monovalent salt (e.g., NaCl) at a concentration $c_s$. This salt dissociates completely into positive and negative ions, each at concentration $c_s$. These small ions can freely diffuse across the membrane.\n\nThe difference in mobile ion concentration across the membrane gives rise to an ionic contribution to the osmotic pressure, known as the Donnan pressure, $\\Pi_D$. It is defined as $\\Pi_D = k_B T (c_{in, mobile} - c_{out, mobile})$, where $c_{in, mobile}$ and $c_{out, mobile}$ are the total number concentrations of all mobile ions inside the polyelectrolyte solution and in the reservoir, respectively.\n\nAs a reference pressure, consider the ideal osmotic pressure that would be exerted by the polymer counter-ions alone in a salt-free environment, given by $\\Pi_{ci}^0 = Z c_m k_B T$.\n\nAssuming the solutions are sufficiently dilute to be treated as ideal (i.e., activities can be replaced by concentrations), determine the specific reservoir salt concentration, $c_s^*$, for which the Donnan pressure $\\Pi_D$ is exactly one-half of the reference counter-ion pressure $\\Pi_{ci}^0$.", "solution": "The problem asks for the reservoir salt concentration $c_s^*$ such that the Donnan pressure $\\Pi_D$ is equal to $\\frac{1}{2} \\Pi_{ci}^0$.\n\nFirst, let's establish the expressions for the pressures involved.\nThe reference pressure is given as:\n$$ \\Pi_{ci}^0 = Z c_m k_B T $$\nThe Donnan pressure $\\Pi_D$ depends on the concentrations of mobile ions inside and outside the membrane. Let $c_+$ and $c_-$ be the concentrations of the mobile positive and negative ions, respectively, inside the polyelectrolyte-containing compartment. In the outside reservoir, the concentration of both positive and negative salt ions is $c_s$.\nThe total mobile ion concentration inside is $c_{in, mobile} = c_+ + c_-$.\nThe total mobile ion concentration outside is $c_{out, mobile} = c_s + c_s = 2c_s$.\nThe Donnan pressure is therefore:\n$$ \\Pi_D = k_B T (c_+ + c_- - 2c_s) $$\n\nNext, we must determine the equilibrium ion concentrations $c_+$ and $c_-$ inside the polyelectrolyte solution. These are governed by two physical principles: electroneutrality inside the solution and thermodynamic equilibrium (Donnan equilibrium) across the membrane.\n\n1.  **Electroneutrality Condition:** The total positive charge concentration must equal the total negative charge concentration inside the solution. The positive charges are the mobile cations, $c_+$. The negative charges are the mobile anions, $c_-$, and the fixed charges on the polymer chains, $Zc_m$.\n    $$ c_+ = c_- + Zc_m $$\n\n2.  **Donnan Equilibrium Condition:** At equilibrium, the electrochemical potential of the permeable salt must be the same on both sides of the membrane. For a monovalent salt, this leads to the product of the mobile ion concentrations inside being equal to the product of the mobile ion concentrations outside.\n    $$ c_+ c_- = c_s \\cdot c_s = c_s^2 $$\n\nNow we solve this system of two equations for $c_+$ and $c_-$. Substitute the electroneutrality condition into the Donnan equilibrium condition:\n$$ (c_- + Zc_m) c_- = c_s^2 $$\n$$ c_-^2 + (Zc_m)c_- - c_s^2 = 0 $$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $c_-$. Using the quadratic formula:\n$$ c_- = \\frac{-Zc_m \\pm \\sqrt{(Zc_m)^2 - 4(1)(-c_s^2)}}{2} = \\frac{-Zc_m \\pm \\sqrt{(Zc_m)^2 + 4c_s^2}}{2} $$\nSince concentration must be a positive quantity, we must choose the positive root:\n$$ c_- = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\sqrt{(Zc_m)^2 + 4c_s^2} - Zc_m\\right) $$\nWe can find $c_+$ using the electroneutrality condition, $c_+ = c_- + Zc_m$:\n$$ c_+ = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\sqrt{(Zc_m)^2 + 4c_s^2} - Zc_m\\right) + Zc_m = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\sqrt{(Zc_m)^2 + 4c_s^2} + Zc_m\\right) $$\n\nNow we can express the Donnan pressure $\\Pi_D$ in terms of the given parameters ($c_m, Z, c_s$). We need the sum $c_+ + c_-$.\n$$ c_+ + c_- = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\sqrt{(Zc_m)^2 + 4c_s^2} + Zc_m\\right) + \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\sqrt{(Zc_m)^2 + 4c_s^2} - Zc_m\\right) $$\n$$ c_+ + c_- = \\sqrt{(Zc_m)^2 + 4c_s^2} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\Pi_D$:\n$$ \\Pi_D = k_B T \\left(\\sqrt{(Zc_m)^2 + 4c_s^2} - 2c_s\\right) $$\n\nThe problem requires us to find the specific salt concentration $c_s^*$ for which $\\Pi_D = \\frac{1}{2}\\Pi_{ci}^0$. We set up the equation:\n$$ k_B T \\left(\\sqrt{(Zc_m)^2 + 4(c_s^*)^2} - 2c_s^*\\right) = \\frac{1}{2} (Z c_m k_B T) $$\nThe factor of $k_B T$ cancels from both sides:\n$$ \\sqrt{(Zc_m)^2 + 4(c_s^*)^2} - 2c_s^* = \\frac{1}{2} Zc_m $$\nTo solve for $c_s^*$, we first isolate the square root term:\n$$ \\sqrt{(Zc_m)^2 + 4(c_s^*)^2} = \\frac{1}{2} Zc_m + 2c_s^* $$\nNow, square both sides of the equation:\n$$ (Zc_m)^2 + 4(c_s^*)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} Zc_m + 2c_s^*\\right)^2 $$\n$$ (Zc_m)^2 + 4(c_s^*)^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} Zc_m\\right)^2 + 2\\left(\\frac{1}{2} Zc_m\\right)(2c_s^*) + (2c_s^*)^2 $$\n$$ (Zc_m)^2 + 4(c_s^*)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}(Zc_m)^2 + 2Zc_m c_s^* + 4(c_s^*)^2 $$\nThe $4(c_s^*)^2$ term appears on both sides and can be canceled.\n$$ (Zc_m)^2 = \\frac{1}{4}(Zc_m)^2 + 2Zc_m c_s^* $$\nNow, we solve for $c_s^*$.\n$$ (Zc_m)^2 - \\frac{1}{4}(Zc_m)^2 = 2Zc_m c_s^* $$\n$$ \\frac{3}{4}(Zc_m)^2 = 2Zc_m c_s^* $$\nAssuming $Zc_m \\neq 0$, we can divide both sides by $2Zc_m$:\n$$ c_s^* = \\frac{\\frac{3}{4}(Zc_m)^2}{2Zc_m} $$\n$$ c_s^* = \\frac{3}{8} Zc_m $$\nThis is the final expression for the required reservoir salt concentration.", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{\\frac{3}{8} Z c_m} $$", "id": "172835"}]}
