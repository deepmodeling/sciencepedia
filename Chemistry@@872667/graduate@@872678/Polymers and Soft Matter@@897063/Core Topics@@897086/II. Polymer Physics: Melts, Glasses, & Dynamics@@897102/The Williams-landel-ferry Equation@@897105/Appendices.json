The Doolittle relation states that the relaxation time $\\tau$ at a temperature $T$ is related to the free volume fraction $f(T)$ by:\n    $$ \\tau(T) = k \\cdot \\exp\\left(\\frac{B}{f(T)}\\right) $$\n    where $k$ is a proportionality constant and $B$ is a material constant, specified as dimensionless.\n\n2.

The expression becomes:\n    $$ f(T) = f_{\\mathrm{ref}} + \\alpha_f \\Delta T $$\n\n5.  Substituting this into the equation for $\\ln(a_T)$:\n    $$ \\ln(a_T) = B \\left( \\frac{1}{f_{\\mathrm{ref}} + \\alpha_f \\Delta T} - \\frac{1}{f_{\\mathrm{ref}}} \\right) $$\n    Combining the terms in the parenthesis gives:\n    $$ \\ln(a_T) = B \\left( \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{ref}} - (f_{\\mathrm{ref}} + \\alpha_f \\Delta T)}{f_{\\mathrm{ref}}(f_{\\mathrm{ref}} + \\alpha_f \\Delta T)} \\right) = B \\left( \\frac{-\\alpha_f \\Delta T}{f_{\\mathrm{ref}}^2 + f_{\\mathrm{ref}} \\alpha_f \\Delta T} \\right) $$\n\n6.

By comparing this derived expression to the standard WLF form, $\\log_{10}(a_T) = \\frac{-C_1(T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}})}{C_2 + (T - T_{\\mathrm{ref}})}$, we identify the constants $C_1$ and $C_2$ as:\n    $$ C_1 = \\frac{B}{f_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\ln(10)} $$\n    $$ C_2 = \\frac{f_{\\mathrm{ref}}}{\\alpha_f} $$\n    $C_1$ is dimensionless, as $B$ and $f_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ are dimensionless. $C_2$ has units of temperature (kelvin), as the units of $\\alpha_f$ are $\\mathrm{K}^{-1}$.\n\n**Step 2: Numerical Computations**\n\nUsing the provided numerical parameters: $T_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 373.15\\ \\mathrm{K}$, $f_{\\mathrm{ref}} = 0.025$, $\\alpha_f = 4.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}$, and $B = 1.0$.\n\n1.  **Computation of $C_1$ and $C_2$**:\n    $$ C_1 = \\frac{1.0}{0.025 \\times \\ln(10)} \\approx 17.3717792... $$\n    $$ C_2 = \\frac{0.025}{4.0 \\times 10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}} = 62.5\\ \\mathrm{K} $$\n\n2.  **Computation of Shift Factors**: The shift factors $\\log_{10}(a_T)$ are calculated using the WLF equation for the specified temperatures:\n    -   $T_1 = T_{\\mathrm{ref}} - 10.0\\ \\mathrm{K} \\implies \\Delta T_1 = -10.0\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n    -   $T_2 = T_{\\mathrm{ref}} + 0.0\\ \\mathrm{K} \\implies \\Delta T_2 = 0.0\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n    -   $T_3 = T_{\\mathrm{ref}} + 10.0\\ \\mathrm{K} \\implies \\Delta T_3 = 10.0\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n    -   $T_4 = T_{\\mathrm{ref}} + 25.0\\ \\mathrm{K} \\implies \\Delta T_4 = 25.0\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n    -   $T_5 = T_{\\mathrm{ref}} - C_2 + 0.1\\ \\mathrm{K} \\implies \\Delta T_5 = -C_2 + 0.1\\ \\mathrm{K} = -62.4\\ \\mathrm{K}$\n\n**Step 3: Master Curve Verification**\n\nThe principle of time-temperature superposition for a thermorheologically simple material states that the effect of changing temperature is equivalent to shifting the viscoelastic response function along the log-frequency axis. For the storage modulus $G'$, this is expressed as $G'(\\omega, T) = G'(\\omega a_T, T_{\\mathrm{ref}})$.\n\n1.  The storage modulus for a single-mode Maxwell model is given by:\n    $$ G'(\\omega; \\tau) = G_0 \\frac{(\\omega \\tau)^2}{1 + (\\omega \\tau)^2} $$\n    The relaxation time at temperature $T$ is $\\tau(T) = \\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}} a_T$.\n\n2.  For each temperature $T \\in \\{T_2, T_3, T_4\\}$ and for each frequency $\\omega$ in the given grid $\\omega \\in \\{0.01,\\ 0.1,\\ 1.0,\\ 10.0,\\ 100.0\\}\\ \\mathrm{rad/s}$, we compute the isothermal modulus $G'_i = G'(\\omega_i; \\tau(T))$.\n\n3.  These data points $(G'_i, \\omega_i)$ are then shifted horizontally to construct the master curve at $T_{\\mathrm{ref}}$. The shifted frequency is $\\omega'_i = \\omega_i a_T$. The modulus value $G'_i$ remains unchanged.\n\n4.  According to the superposition principle, each shifted point $(\\omega'_i, G'_i)$ must lie on the analytic reference curve, defined as:\n    $$ G'_{\\mathrm{ref}}(\\omega') = G_0 \\frac{(\\omega' \\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}})^2}{1 + (\\omega' \\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}})^2} $$\n    This is because $G'(\\omega_i, T) = G_0 \\frac{(\\omega_i \\tau(T))^2}{1 + (\\omega_i \\tau(T))^2} = G_0 \\frac{(\\omega_i a_T \\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}})^2}{1 + (\\omega_i a_T \\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}})^2} = G_0 \\frac{(\\omega'_i \\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}})^2}{1 + (\\omega'_i \\tau_{\\mathrm{ref}})^2} = G'_{\\mathrm{ref}}(\\omega'_i)$.\n\n5.  The root-mean-square (RMS) deviation is calculated to quantify the agreement between the shifted data and the analytic reference curve. For a set of $N$ shifted points:\n    $$ \\mathrm{RMS} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left(G'_i - G'_{\\mathrm{ref}}(\\omega'_i)\\right)^2} $$\n    Theoretically, this deviation should be zero. Any non-zero result will be exclusively due to floating-point numerical precision limitations. The total number of points is $N = 3 \\text{ temperatures} \\times 5 \\text{ frequencies} = 15$.\n\nThe following program implements these steps to compute the required values.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef solve():\n    \"\"\"\n    Derives WLF equation, computes parameters C1 and C2, shift factors,\n    and verifies time-temperature superposition for a Maxwell model.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # --- Numerical Parameters ---\n    T_ref = 373.15  # Reference temperature in K\n    f_ref = 0.025   # Free-volume fraction at T_ref (dimensionless)\n    alpha_f = 4.0e-4 # Thermal expansion coefficient of free volume (K^-1)\n    B = 1.0         # Doolittle parameter (dimensionless)\n    G0 = 1.0e6      # Maxwell model modulus (Pa)\n    tau_ref = 1.0     # Maxwell model relaxation time at T_ref (s)\n\n    # Frequency grid for each isotherm (rad/s)\n    omega_grid = np.array([0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0, 100.0])\n\n    # --- Computational Task 1: Compute C1 and C2 ---\n    # Derive C1 and C2 from fundamental parameters.\n    # log10(aT) = -(C1 * (T - T_ref)) / (C2 + (T - T_ref))\n    # C1 = B / (f_ref * ln(10))\n    # C2 = f_ref / alpha_f\n    C1 = B / (f_ref * np.log(10))\n    C2 = f_ref / alpha_f\n\n    # --- Computational Task 2: Compute log10(a_T) ---\n    def calculate_log10_aT(T, T_ref_val, C1_val, C2_val):\n        \"\"\"Calculates log10(aT) using the WLF equation.\"\"\"\n        delta_T = T - T_ref_val\n        # Avoid division by zero if delta_T = -C2, though not the case here.\n        if C2_val + delta_T == 0:\n            return np.inf if -C1_val * delta_T > 0 else -np.inf\n        return (-C1_val * delta_T) / (C2_val + delta_T)\n\n    # Define the temperatures for calculation\n    T1 = T_ref - 10.0\n    T2 = T_ref + 0.0\n    T3 = T_ref + 10.0\n    T4 = T_ref + 25.0\n    T5 = T_ref - C2 + 0.1\n\n    log10_aT1 = calculate_log10_aT(T1, T_ref, C1, C2)\n    log10_aT2 = calculate_log10_aT(T2, T_ref, C1, C2)\n    log10_aT3 = calculate_log10_aT(T3, T_ref, C1, C2)\n    log10_aT4 = calculate_log10_aT(T4, T_ref, C1, C2)\n    log10_aT5 = calculate_log10_aT(T5, T_ref, C1, C2)\n    \n    # --- Computational Task 3: Construct Master Curve and Compute RMS ---\n    temperatures_for_rms = [T2, T3, T4]\n    shifted_points = []\n    \n    # Maxwell storage modulus functional form\n    def G_prime(omega, tau, G0_val):\n        return G0_val * (omega * tau)**2 / (1 + (omega * tau)**2)\n\n    # Analytic reference storage modulus\n    def G_prime_ref(omega_prime, tau_ref_val, G0_val):\n        return G0_val * (omega_prime * tau_ref_val)**2 / (1 + (omega_prime * tau_ref_val)**2)\n\n    squared_errors = []\n    \n    for T in temperatures_for_rms:\n        log10_aT_val = calculate_log10_aT(T, T_ref, C1, C2)\n        aT = 10**log10_aT_val\n        tau_T = tau_ref * aT\n        \n        for omega in omega_grid:\n            # Calculate G' at temperature T\n            G_prime_isothermal = G_prime(omega, tau_T, G0)\n            \n            # Apply horizontal shift\n            omega_prime = omega * aT\n            \n            # The shifted G' value is the same as the isothermal G'\n            G_prime_shifted = G_prime_isothermal\n            \n            # Calculate the value on the analytic reference curve\n            G_prime_analytic_ref = G_prime_ref(omega_prime, tau_ref, G0)\n            \n            # Calculate squared error\n            error = G_prime_shifted - G_prime_analytic_ref\n            squared_errors.append(error**2)\n\n    # Calculate RMS deviation\n    if not squared_errors:\n        rms_deviation = 0.0\n    else:\n        mean_squared_error = np.mean(squared_errors)\n        rms_deviation = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error)\n        \n    # --- Format and Print Final Output ---\n    results = [\n        C1,\n        C2,\n        log10_aT1,\n        log10_aT2,\n        log10_aT3,\n        log10_aT4,\n        rms_deviation,\n        log10_aT5\n    ]\n\n    # Format all results to 6 decimal places\n    formatted_results = [f\"{x:.6f}\" for x in results]\n    \n    # Print in the specified single-line format\n    print(f\"[{','.join(formatted_results)}]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2934880"}]}
