It presents a standard theoretical exercise in the field of colloid and interface science, based on the established principles of Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek (DLVO) theory. All provided definitions and approximations are standard. The problem is therefore deemed valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe objective is to derive the van der Waals attractive force between two identical spheres in two distinct asymptotic regimes—near-contact ($h \\ll R$) and far-field ($h \\gg R$)—and then to determine the crossover separation at which these two asymptotic forms have equal magnitude.\n\nFirst, we derive the force in the near-contact regime, $h \\ll R$. The problem specifies the use of the Proximity Force Approximation, also known as the Derjaguin approximation. The force $F(h)$ between two curved bodies is related to the interaction free energy per unit area between two parallel planar half-spaces, $U_{pp}(h)$, by the relation:\n$$F(h) \\approx 2 \\pi R_{\\mathrm{eff}} U_{pp}(h)$$\nFor two identical spheres of radius $R$, the radii are $R_1 = R_2 = R$. The effective radius $R_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ is therefore:\n$$R_{\\mathrm{eff}} = \\frac{R_1 R_2}{R_1 + R_2} = \\frac{R \\cdot R}{R + R} = \\frac{R^2}{2R} = \\frac{R}{2}$$\nThe problem provides the expression for the non-retarded van der Waals interaction energy per unit area for parallel plates:\n$$U_{pp}(h) = -\\frac{A_H}{12 \\pi h^2}$$\nwhere $A_H$ is the Hamaker constant. Substituting these expressions into the Derjaguin approximation, we obtain the force for the near-contact regime:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{vdW, near}}(h) \\approx 2 \\pi \\left(\\frac{R}{2}\\right) \\left(-\\frac{A_H}{12 \\pi h^2}\\right)$$\nSimplifying this expression yields the leading-order behavior of the force for $h \\ll R$:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{vdW, near}}(h) = -\\frac{A_H R}{12 h^2}$$\nThe negative sign correctly indicates an attractive force. The magnitude of this force is $|F_{\\mathrm{vdW, near}}(h)| = \\frac{A_H R}{12 h^2}$, which scales as $h^{-2}$.\n\nSecond, we derive the force in the far-field regime, $h \\gg R$. This implies that the center-to-center distance $d = 2R + h$ is also much larger than the radius $R$, i.e., $d \\gg R$. In this limit, the finite size of the spheres is negligible compared to their separation, and they can be treated as point-like macro-particles located at their respective centers. The total interaction energy $U(d)$ is found by summing the pairwise potential $v(s) = -C s^{-6}$ over all molecule pairs between the two spheres. In the far-field limit, the distance $s$ between any pair of molecules can be approximated as the center-to-center distance $d$.\n$$U(d) \\approx \\left(\\int_{V_1} \\rho \\, dV_1\\right) \\left(\\int_{V_2} \\rho \\, dV_2\\right) v(d)$$\nwhere $\\rho$ is the molecular number density and $V_1$ and $V_2$ are the volumes of the two spheres. The integral $\\int_V \\rho \\, dV$ is the total number of molecules in a sphere, $N = \\rho V = \\rho \\frac{4}{3} \\pi R^3$. The potential energy is then:\n$$U(d) \\approx (\\rho V)^2 (-C d^{-6}) = -\\rho^2 C \\left(\\frac{4}{3} \\pi R^3\\right)^2 d^{-6} = -\\frac{16}{9} \\pi^2 \\rho^2 C R^6 d^{-6}$$\nThe problem provides the definition of the Hamaker constant, $A_H = \\pi^2 \\rho^2 C$. Substituting this into the energy expression, we get:\n$$U(d) \\approx -\\frac{16 A_H R^6}{9 d^6}$$\nThe force $F(h)$ is the negative derivative of the potential energy with respect to the surface-to-surface separation $h$. Since $d = 2R + h$, we have $dd/dh = 1$, so $d/dh$ is equivalent to $d/dd$:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{vdW, far}}(d) = -\\frac{dU}{dh} = -\\frac{d}{dd}\\left(-\\frac{16 A_H R^6}{9 d^6}\\right) = \\frac{16 A_H R^6}{9} \\frac{d}{dd}(d^{-6})$$\n$$F_{\\mathrm{vdW, far}}(d) = \\frac{16 A_H R^6}{9} (-6 d^{-7}) = -\\frac{32 A_H R^6}{3 d^7}$$\nTo find the leading-order scaling for $h \\gg R$, we substitute $d = 2R + h \\approx h$:\n$$F_{\\mathrm{vdW, far}}(h) \\approx -\\frac{32 A_H R^6}{3 h^7}$$\nThe magnitude of this far-field force is $|F_{\\mathrm{vdW, far}}(h)| = \\frac{32 A_H R^6}{3 h^7}$, which scales as $h^{-7}$.\n\nFinally, we compute the crossover separation $h_c$, which is defined as the separation where the magnitudes of the near-contact and far-field asymptotic force expressions are equal:\n$$|F_{\\mathrm{vdW, near}}(h_c)| = |F_{\\mathrm{vdW, far}}(h_c)|$$\nSubstituting the derived expressions for the magnitudes:\n$$\\frac{A_H R}{12 h_c^2} = \\frac{32 A_H R^6}{3 h_c^7}$$\nAssuming $A_H \\neq 0$ and $R \\neq 0$, we can cancel terms:\n$$\\frac{1}{12 h_c^2} = \\frac{32 R^5}{3 h_c^7}$$\nWe rearrange the equation to solve for $h_c$:\n$$3 h_c^7 = 12 \\cdot 32 R^5 h_c^2$$\n$$h_c^5 = \\frac{12 \\cdot 32}{3} R^5 = 4 \\cdot 32 R^5 = 128 R^5$$\nTaking the fifth root of both sides gives the expression for $h_c$:\n$$h_c = (128 R^5)^{\\frac{1}{5}} = (128)^{\\frac{1}{5}} R$$\nSince $128 = 2^7$, we have $(128)^{\\frac{1}{5}} = (2^7)^{\\frac{1}{5}} = 2^{\\frac{7}{5}}$.\nThus, $h_c = 2^{\\frac{7}{5}} R$.

The method involves rescaling the force data, fitting it to an exponential master curve, and comparing the goodness-of-fit.\n\n**Theoretical Basis**\nThe underlying physical principle is that within the Debye-Hückel approximation for long distances, the electrostatic repulsion force $F(h)$ between two surfaces in an electrolyte solution has a dominant exponential decay with separation $h$. The decay length is the Debye length, $\\kappa^{-1}$. The pre-factor of this exponential depends on the surface boundary conditions.\n- For constant surface potential ($\\psi$), the force is approximately proportional to $\\kappa$, i.e., $F(h) \\propto \\kappa e^{-\\kappa h}$.\n- For constant surface charge ($\\sigma$), the force is approximately proportional to $\\kappa^{-1}$, i.e., $F(h) \\propto \\frac{1}{\\kappa} e^{-\\kappa h}$.\n\nBy rescaling the force, we can test these proportionalities.\n- **Constant $\\psi$ test**: We plot $y = F(h)/\\kappa$ against $x = \\kappa h$. If the hypothesis is correct, the data from different $\\kappa$ values should collapse onto a single master curve, approximately $y \\approx A_{\\psi} e^{-x}$.\n- **Constant $\\sigma$ test**: We plot $y = \\kappa F(h)$ against $x = \\kappa h$. If this hypothesis is correct, the data should collapse to $y \\approx A_{\\sigma} e^{-x}$.\n\n**Methodology**\n\n1.  **Data Generation and Filtering**: For each case, we have three datasets corresponding to three values of $\\kappa_i$. For each dataset, we generate the force $F_i(h)$ at specified separations $h$. We only consider data points $(h_j, F_j)$ for which the dimensionless separation $\\kappa_i h_j \\ge 2$.\n\n2.  **Least-Squares Fit for Amplitude $A$**: For a given hypothesis, we collect all the retained and rescaled data points $(x_j, y_j)$. We must find the optimal amplitude $A$ for the model $y = A e^{-x}$ by minimizing the sum of squared residuals, $S(A) = \\sum_j (y_j - A e^{-x_j})^2$. The minimum is found by setting the derivative $\\frac{dS}{dA}$ to zero:\n    $$\n    \\frac{d S}{d A} = \\sum_j -2e^{-x_j}(y_j - A e^{-x_j}) = 0\n    $$\n    Solving for $A$ yields the expression for the best-fit amplitude:\n    $$\n    A = \\frac{\\sum_j y_j e^{-x_j}}{\\sum_j e^{-2x_j}}\n    $$\n    This calculation must be performed independently for the $\\psi$-scaled data and the $\\sigma$-scaled data, yielding $A_{\\psi}$ and $A_{\\sigma}$.\n\n3.  **Error Calculation**: The goodness-of-fit is quantified by the normalized mean squared deviation $E$:\n    $$\n    E = \\frac{\\sum_j \\left(y_j - A e^{-x_j}\\right)^2}{\\sum_j y_j^2}\n    $$\n    This is computed for both hypotheses, yielding $E_{\\psi}$ and $E_{\\sigma}$.\n\n4.  **Decision**: For each case, we compare the two error metrics. Based on our corrected rule, if $E_{\\psi} \\le E_{\\sigma}$, we conclude that the constant potential hypothesis is favored (result is `True`). Otherwise, the constant charge hypothesis is favored (result is `False`).\n\nNow, I will apply this procedure to each of the three specified cases.\n\n**Case 1: Constant $\\psi$-like data**\n- Screening parameters: $\\kappa \\in \\{0.10, 0.20, 0.30\\}\\ \\mathrm{nm}^{-1}$.\n- Force law: $F(h) = A_0\\, \\kappa\\, e^{-\\kappa h}\\,\\left[1 + \\epsilon \\sin(\\alpha h)\\right]$, with $A_0 = 0.2$, $\\epsilon = 0.01$, $\\alpha = 0.1\\ \\mathrm{nm}^{-1}$.\nThe force is constructed to be proportional to $\\kappa$, so we expect the constant $\\psi$ hypothesis to yield a much better data collapse and a smaller error $E_{\\psi}$.\n\n**Case 2: Constant $\\sigma$-like data**\n- Screening parameters: $\\kappa \\in \\{0.08, 0.16, 0.32\\}\\ \\mathrm{nm}^{-1}$.\n- Force law: $F(h) = \\frac{B_0}{\\kappa}\\, e^{-\\kappa h}\\,\\left[1 + \\epsilon \\cos(\\beta h)\\right]$, with $B_0 = 0.02$, $\\epsilon = 0.01$, $\\beta = 0.07\\ \\mathrm{nm}^{-1}$.\nThe force is constructed to be proportional to $\\kappa^{-1}$. We expect the constant $\\sigma$ hypothesis to be superior, resulting in $E_{\\sigma}  E_{\\psi}$.\n\n**Case 3: Partially regulated, mixed data**\n- Screening parameters: $\\kappa \\in \\{0.09, 0.18, 0.36\\}\\ \\mathrm{nm}^{-1}$.\n- Force law: $F(h) = \\left[\\alpha_{\\mathrm{mix}}\\, A_0\\, \\kappa + (1-\\alpha_{\\mathrm{mix}})\\,\\frac{B_0}{\\kappa}\\right] e^{-\\kappa h}\\,\\left[1 + \\tilde{\\epsilon}\\, \\sin(\\tilde{\\alpha} h)\\right]$, with $A_0 = 0.2$, $B_0 = 0.02$, $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{mix}}=0.7$, $\\tilde{\\epsilon}=0.005$, $\\tilde{\\alpha}=0.11\\ \\mathrm{nm}^{-1}$.\nThis case represents a mixture of the two behaviors. The weighting factor $\\alpha_{\\mathrm{mix}}=0.7$ indicates that the behavior is predominantly constant $\\psi$-like. Therefore, it is predicted that the constant $\\psi$ scaling will provide a better, though imperfect, collapse, such that $E_{\\psi}  E_{\\sigma}$.\n\nThe implementation will proceed by executing these steps for each case and applying the corrected decision rule. The final output will be a list of booleans reflecting the decision for each case.", "answer": "[True,False,True]", "id": "2912191"}]}
