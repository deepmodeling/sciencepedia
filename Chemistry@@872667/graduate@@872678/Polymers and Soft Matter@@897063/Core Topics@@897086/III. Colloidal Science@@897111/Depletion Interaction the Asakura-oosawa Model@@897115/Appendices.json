All necessary information and definitions are provided. Therefore, the problem is valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe problem is addressed in three parts as requested.\n\n1) Depletion free energy per unit area for parallel plates, $W_{\\mathrm{pp}}(h)$.\nAccording to the Asakura-Oosawa (AO) model, the interaction potential is given by the osmotic pressure $\\Pi$ of the depletant reservoir multiplied by the change in the volume accessible to the depletants. This is equivalent to stating that the potential $U$ is the negative of the osmotic pressure times the overlap volume of the regions from which depletants are excluded: $U = -\\Pi V_{\\mathrm{ov}}$.\n\nFor a single large, flat plate, the centers of the spherical depletants of radius $R_{d}$ are excluded from a region of thickness $R_{d}$ adjacent to the plate's surface. When two such parallel plates are brought to a surface-to-surface separation $h$, their individual exclusion zones, each of thickness $R_{d}$, begin to overlap when $h  2R_{d}$.\n\nFor a plate separation $h  2R_{d}$, the depletant centers are completely excluded from the gap between the plates. The two exclusion zones, one from each plate, overlap in a region of thickness $(2R_{d} - h)$. For a given plate area $A$, the total overlap volume is $V_{\\mathrm{ov}}(h) = A(2R_{d} - h)$. This is the volume that becomes available to the depletants in the bulk reservoir when the plates are brought from a large distance to the separation $h$.\n\nThe depletion free energy of interaction for the plates is therefore $U_{\\mathrm{pp}}(h) = -\\Pi V_{\\mathrm{ov}}(h) = -\\Pi A(2R_{d} - h)$. The free energy per unit area, $W_{\\mathrm{pp}}(h)$, is obtained by dividing by the area $A$:\n$$\nW_{\\mathrm{pp}}(h) = \\frac{U_{\\mathrm{pp}}(h)}{A} = -\\Pi(2R_{d} - h)\n$$\nThis expression is valid for separations $0  h  2R_{d}$. For $h \\ge 2R_{d}$, there is no overlap of exclusion zones, so $W_{\\mathrm{pp}}(h) = 0$.\n\n2) Leading-order force using the Derjaguin approximation.\nThe Derjaguin approximation relates the force $F(h)$ between two curved bodies with a large radius of curvature to the interaction energy per unit area $W_{\\mathrm{pp}}(h)$ between two infinite parallel plates. For two identical spheres of radius $R_{c}$ at a close separation $h$, the force is given by:\n$$\nF(h) \\approx \\pi R_{c} W_{\\mathrm{pp}}(h)\n$$\nThis approximation is valid when the interaction range is much smaller than the radius of the spheres, i.e., $2R_{d} \\ll R_{c}$, which corresponds to the limit $q = R_{d}/R_{c} \\ll 1$ specified in the problem.\n\nSubstituting the expression for $W_{\\mathrm{pp}}(h)$ from Part 1, we obtain the leading-order force, which is the Derjaguin force $F_{\\mathrm{D}}(h)$:\n$$\nF_{\\mathrm{D}}(h) = -\\pi R_{c} \\Pi (2R_{d} - h)\n$$\nThis force is attractive (negative sign) for $h  2R_{d}$. The expression shows that the force's dependence on the separation variables $h$ and $R_{d}$ is only through the combination $s = 2R_{d} - h$, which can be interpreted as the \"plate-plate overlap thickness\". This result represents the leading-order term in an expansion in the small parameter $q$.\n\n3) Correction to the Derjaguin force and the final expression for $F(h)$.\nTo find the correction, we must calculate the exact force using the AO model for two spheres and then expand the result. The interaction potential is $U(r) = -\\Pi V_{\\mathrm{ov}}(r)$, where $V_{\\mathrm{ov}}(r)$ is the overlap volume of the two exclusion spheres of radius $R = R_{c} + R_{d}$ whose centers are separated by a distance $r$. The problem provides the formula for this overlap volume for $r \\le 2R$:\n$$\nV_{\\mathrm{ov}}(r) = \\frac{\\pi}{12}(4R+r)(2R-r)^{2}\n$$\nThe force between the colloids is given by $F(r) = - \\frac{dU}{dr}$.\n$$\nF(r) = - \\frac{d}{dr} \\left[ -\\Pi \\frac{\\pi}{12}(4R+r)(2R-r)^{2} \\right] = \\frac{\\pi \\Pi}{12} \\frac{d}{dr} \\left[ (4R+r)(2R-r)^{2} \\right]\n$$\nUsing the product rule for differentiation:\n$$\n\\frac{d}{dr} \\left[ (4R+r)(2R-r)^{2} \\right] = (1)(2R-r)^{2} + (4R+r) \\cdot 2(2R-r)(-1) = (2R-r)[(2R-r) - 2(4R+r)]\n$$\n$$\n= (2R-r)(2R - r - 8R - 2r) = (2R-r)(-6R - 3r) = -3(2R-r)(2R+r) = -3(4R^{2}-r^{2})\n$$\nSubstituting this back into the expression for the force:\n$$\nF(r) = \\frac{\\pi \\Pi}{12} \\left[ -3(4R^{2}-r^{2}) \\right] = -\\frac{\\pi \\Pi}{4}(4R^{2}-r^{2})\n$$\nThis is the exact force within the AO model. Now, we express it in terms of the colloid radius $R_{c}$, depletant radius $R_{d}$, and surface-to-surface separation $h$.

The second term, which is independent of $R_{c}$, is the first correction to the Derjaguin approximation. The ratio of the correction to the leading term is of order $R_{d}/R_{c} = q$, so this correction is indeed the \"first order\" correction in the sense of an expansion in curvature $1/R_c$ or, equivalently, the parameter $q$.\n\nThe problem requests the final result as a single closed-form analytic expression for $F(h)$.

Therefore, $|\\vec{r}|^2  a^2$, which means any point $P$ in the intersection of $\\mathcal{B}_1$ and $\\mathcal{B}_3$ lies strictly inside the sphere $\\mathcal{B}_2$.\nThis proves that $\\mathcal{B}_1 \\cap \\mathcal{B}_3 \\subset \\mathcal{B}_2$, and consequently, $|\\mathcal{B}_1 \\cap \\mathcal{B}_2 \\cap \\mathcal{B}_3| = |\\mathcal{B}_1 \\cap \\mathcal{B}_3| = V_{\\text{int}}(L)$.\n\nSubstituting these volumes into the expression for $\\Delta \\Omega_3(L)$:\n$$\\Delta \\Omega_3(L) = \\Pi \\left( -V_{\\text{int}}(L/2) - V_{\\text{int}}(L/2) - V_{\\text{int}}(L) + V_{\\text{int}}(L) \\right) = -2\\Pi V_{\\text{int}}(L/2)$$\nThe force $F_3(L)$ is the negative derivative of this potential with respect to $L$:\n$$F_3(L) = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial L} \\left[-2\\Pi V_{\\text{int}}(L/2)\\right] = 2\\Pi \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial L} V_{\\text{int}}(L/2)$$\nUsing the chain rule, with $s=L/2$:\n$$F_3(L) = 2\\Pi \\left( \\frac{d V_{\\text{int}}}{ds} \\bigg|_{s=L/2} \\right) \\frac{d(L/2)}{dL} = \\Pi \\frac{d V_{\\text{int}}}{ds} \\bigg|_{s=L/2}$$\nThe derivative of the intersection volume is:\n$$\\frac{d V_{\\text{int}}}{ds} = \\frac{d}{ds} \\left[ \\frac{\\pi}{12}(16a^3 - 12a^2s + s^3) \\right] = \\frac{\\pi}{12}(-12a^2 + 3s^2) = -\\pi(a^2 - s^2/4)$$\nEvaluating this at $s=L/2$:\n$$F_3(L) = \\Pi \\left[ -\\pi(a^2 - (L/2)^2/4) \\right] = -\\pi\\Pi(a^2 - L^2/16)$$\n\nNext, we find the two-body force $F_2(L)$ between the two outer colloids in isolation. The potential $\\Delta \\Omega_2(L)$ involves only colloids $1$ and $3$, separated by $L$:\n$$\\Delta \\Omega_2(L) = \\Pi \\left( |\\mathcal{B}_1 \\cup \\mathcal{B}_3| - (|\\mathcal{B}_1| + |\\mathcal{B}_3|) \\right) = -\\Pi |\\mathcal{B}_1 \\cap \\mathcal{B}_3| = -\\Pi V_{\\text{int}}(L)$$\nThe corresponding force $F_2(L)$ is:\n$$F_2(L) = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial L} \\left[ -\\Pi V_{\\text{int}}(L) \\right] = \\Pi \\frac{d V_{\\text{int}}}{dL} = \\Pi \\left[ -\\pi(a^2 - L^2/4) \\right] = -\\pi\\Pi(a^2 - L^2/4)$$\n\nNow we compute the force modification $\\Delta F(L) = F_3(L) - F_2(L)$:\n$$\\Delta F(L) = \\left[ -\\pi\\Pi(a^2 - L^2/16) \\right] - \\left[ -\\pi\\Pi(a^2 - L^2/4) \\right]$$\n$$\\Delta F(L) = \\pi\\Pi \\left( -(a^2 - L^2/16) + (a^2 - L^2/4) \\right) = \\pi\\Pi \\left( -a^2 + \\frac{L^2}{16} + a^2 - \\frac{L^2}{4} \\right)$$\n$$\\Delta F(L) = \\pi\\Pi \\left( \\frac{L^2 - 4L^2}{16} \\right) = -\\frac{3\\pi\\Pi}{16}L^2$$\nThis is the analytic expression for the force modification.\n\nFinally, we must determine the separation $L^{\\star}$ in the admissible interval $4 R_c \\le L \\le 2(R_c+R_p)$ at which the magnitude $|\\Delta F(L)|$ is maximized.\nThe magnitude is:\n$$|\\Delta F(L)| = \\left| -\\frac{3\\pi\\Pi}{16}L^2 \\right| = \\frac{3\\pi\\Pi}{16}L^2$$\nThe function $f(L)=L^2$ is a monotonically increasing function for $L > 0$. The specified interval $[4R_c, 2(R_c+R_p)]$ consists of positive values of $L$. Therefore, the maximum value of $|\\Delta F(L)|$ on this closed interval must occur at the largest possible value of $L$, which is the right endpoint of the interval.\n$$L^{\\star} = 2(R_c+R_p)$$\nThis is the separation at which the magnitude of the three-body force contribution is maximized.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2(R_c+R_p)}$$", "id": "2911919"}]}
