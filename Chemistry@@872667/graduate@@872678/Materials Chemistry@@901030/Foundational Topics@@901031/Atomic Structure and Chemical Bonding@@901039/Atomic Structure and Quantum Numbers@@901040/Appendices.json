We work in the Russell–Saunders (LS) coupling limit, where we first couple the individual orbital angular momenta to a total orbital angular momentum $\\mathbf{L}$, and the individual spins to a total spin $\\mathbf{S}$, and then consider spin–orbit coupling that combines $\\mathbf{L}$ and $\\mathbf{S}$ to form the total angular momentum $\\mathbf{J}$.\n\nStep $1$: Allowed $\\mathbf{L}$ and $\\mathbf{S}$ values from vector addition.\n- For two identical orbital angular momenta $l=3$, the possible total orbital angular momenta from $\\mathbf{L}=\\mathbf{l}_{1}+\\mathbf{l}_{2}$ are the integers\n$$\nL=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,\n$$\ncorresponding to spectroscopic letters $S,P,D,F,G,H,I$, respectively.\n- For two spins $s=\\tfrac{1}{2}$, the possible total spins are\n$$\nS=0 \\quad \\text{(singlet)}, \\qquad S=1 \\quad \\text{(triplet)}.\n$$\n\nStep $2$: Symmetry under particle exchange and the Pauli exclusion principle.\nThe total electronic wavefunction must be antisymmetric under exchange of the two equivalent electrons. It factorizes (ignoring the radial part common to both electrons in the same subshell) into a spatial part and a spin part. For two identical $l=3$ electrons, the coupled spatial state with a given $L$ is symmetric under exchange for even $L$ and antisymmetric for odd $L$. The coupled spin state is symmetric under exchange for $S=1$ and antisymmetric for $S=0$.\n\nTo obtain an overall antisymmetric total state, the spatial and spin parts must have opposite permutation symmetry:\n- If $S=1$ (symmetric spin), then the spatial part must be antisymmetric, which requires odd $L$.\n- If $S=0$ (antisymmetric spin), then the spatial part must be symmetric, which requires even $L$.\n\nTherefore, the allowed combinations are:\n- Singlets $S=0$ with even $L=0,2,4,6$: $^{1}S$, $^{1}D$, $^{1}G$, $^{1}I$.\n- Triplets $S=1$ with odd $L=1,3,5$: $^{3}P$, $^{3}F$, $^{3}H$.\n\nThus, the complete set of allowed $^{2S+1}L$ terms for $f^{2}$ is\n$$\n^{1}S,\\; ^{1}D,\\; ^{1}G,\\; ^{1}I,\\; ^{3}P,\\; ^{3}F,\\; ^{3}H.\n$$\n\nStep $3$: Microstate counting consistency.\nThe direct combinatorial count of microstates for placing $n=2$ electrons into $2(2l+1)=14$ spin–orbitals is\n$$\n\\binom{14}{2}=91.\n$$\nThe sum of $(2S+1)(2L+1)$ over all allowed $^{2S+1}L$ terms is\n- Singlets: $^{1}S$ contributes $(1)(1)=1$, $^{1}D$ contributes $(1)(5)=5$, $^{1}G$ contributes $(1)(9)=9$, $^{1}I$ contributes $(1)(13)=13$, totaling $1+5+9+13=28$.\n- Triplets: $^{3}P$ contributes $(3)(3)=9$, $^{3}F$ contributes $(3)(7)=21$, $^{3}H$ contributes $(3)(11)=33$, totaling $9+21+33=63$.\n\nSumming singlets and triplets gives\n$$\n28+63=91,\n$$\nwhich matches the combinatorial count, confirming that no terms have been omitted or spuriously included.\n\nStep $4$: Hund’s rules to identify the ground term.\nHund’s first rule (maximize $S$) selects the triplet manifold $S=1$ over the singlets $S=0$.\nHund’s second rule (for a given $S$, maximize $L$) selects the largest allowed $L$ among the triplets.
