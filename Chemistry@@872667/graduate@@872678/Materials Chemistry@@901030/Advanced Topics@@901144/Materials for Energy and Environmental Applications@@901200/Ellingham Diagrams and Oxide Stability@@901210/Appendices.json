Let us denote the low-temperature phase as $\\alpha$-MO and the high-temperature phase as $\\beta$-MO. By the definition of a first-order phase transition at equilibrium, the chemical potentials of the two phases are equal at the transition temperature $T_t$:\n$$ \\mu_{\\alpha-MO}^{\\circ}(T_t) = \\mu_{\\beta-MO}^{\\circ}(T_t) $$\nThis equality is the condition for phase equilibrium at constant temperature and pressure.\n\nLet us examine the value of $\\Delta G^{\\circ}(T)$ at $T=T_t$.

Thus, $\\Delta G^{\\circ}(T)$ is a continuous function of temperature across the transition at $T_t$.
