The problem states $\\gamma=1$.\n\n**(a) Purely Fluorescent Device**\n\nIn a standard fluorescent device, light is generated only from the radiative decay of singlet excitons. According to spin statistics, electrical injection creates excitons in a $1:3$ ratio of singlets ($S_1$) to triplets ($T_1$). Thus, the fraction of singlets formed is $f_S = 0.25$, and the fraction of triplets is $f_T = 0.75$.\nThe triplet excitons cannot decay radiatively in a purely fluorescent material and are considered a loss channel.

The goal is to convert all excitons, both singlet and triplet, into singlets on the terminal fluorescent emitter ($F$).\n\n**(i) Derivation of the EQE expression**\n\nWe trace the fate of the excitons formed on the sensitizer $S$.\n1.  **Initial Singlets**: A fraction $f_S$ of excitons are formed as singlets on $S$. These are transferred to $F$ via FRET with an efficiency $\\eta_{\\text{ET}}$. The fraction of total excitons that successfully reach $F$ via this direct pathway is $f_S \\cdot \\eta_{\\text{ET}}$.\n2.  **Initial Triplets**: A fraction $f_T$ of excitons are formed as triplets on $S$. These triplets can be upconverted to singlets on $S$ via reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) with an efficiency $\\eta_{\\text{RISC}}$. The fraction of total excitons converted from triplet to singlet on $S$ is $f_T \\cdot \\eta_{\\text{RISC}}$. These newly created singlets on $S$ must then be transferred to $F$ via FRET, also with efficiency $\\eta_{\\text{ET}}$. The fraction of total excitons that successfully reach $F$ via this triplet-harvesting pathway is $(f_T \\cdot \\eta_{\\text{RISC}}) \\cdot \\eta_{\\text{ET}}$.\n\nThe total exciton utilization efficiency, $\\eta_{\\text{exciton}}$, is the sum of the fractions from both pathways. This represents the total fraction of initial excitons that are successfully delivered as singlets to the emitter $F$.\n$$ \\eta_{\\text{exciton}} = (f_S \\cdot \\eta_{\\text{ET}}) + (f_T \\cdot \\eta_{\\text{RISC}} \\cdot \\eta_{\\text{ET}}) $$\nFactoring out the common transfer efficiency term $\\eta_{\\text{ET}}$:\n$$ \\eta_{\\text{exciton}} = \\eta_{\\text{ET}} (f_S + f_T \\cdot \\eta_{\\text{RISC}}) $$\nThis is the full expression for the exciton harvesting and transfer process.

Let $k_{S,decay} = k_{r,S} + k_{nr,S}$ and $k_{T,decay} = k_{r,T} + k_{nr,T}$. Then $k_S = k_{S,decay} + k_{\\mathrm{ISC}}$ and $k_T = k_{T,decay} + k_{\\mathrm{RISC}}$. The denominator term becomes $k_S k_T - k_{\\mathrm{ISC}} k_{\\mathrm{RISC}} = k_{S,decay}k_{T,decay} + k_{S,decay}k_{\\mathrm{RISC}} + k_{T,decay}k_{\\mathrm{ISC}}$. Using this, the populations are $n_S = G \\frac{p_S k_{T,decay} + k_{\\mathrm{RISC}}}{k_{S,decay}k_{T,decay} + k_{S,decay}k_{\\mathrm{RISC}} + k_{T,decay}k_{\\mathrm{ISC}}}$ and $n_T = G \\frac{p_T k_{S,decay} + k_{\\mathrm{ISC}}}{k_{S,decay}k_{T,decay} + k_{S,decay}k_{\\mathrm{RISC}} + k_{T,decay}k_{\\mathrm{ISC}}}$.\nThe radiative efficiency is then:\n$$\n\\eta_{\\mathrm{rad}} = \\frac{k_{r,S}(p_S k_{T,decay} + k_{\\mathrm{RISC}}) + k_{r,T}(p_T k_{S,decay} + k_{\\mathrm{ISC}})}{k_{S,decay}k_{T,decay} + k_{S,decay}k_{\\mathrm{RISC}} + k_{T,decay}k_{\\mathrm{ISC}}}\n$$\nThis is the final analytical expression used for numerical evaluation, with $p_{S}=0.25$ and $p_{T}=0.75$.\n\nCase 1: Fluorescent OLED\nGiven rates: $k_{r,S} = 1.0 \\times 10^{8} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $k_{nr,S} = 1.0 \\times 10^{7} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $k_{\\mathrm{ISC}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{6} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $k_{r,T} = 0 \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $k_{nr,T} = 1.0 \\times 10^{4} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $k_{\\mathrm{RISC}} = 0 \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nWe have $k_{S,decay} = 1.0 \\times 10^{8} + 1.0 \\times 10^{7} = 1.1 \\times 10^{8} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $k_{T,decay} = 0 + 1.0 \\times 10^{4} = 1.0 \\times 10^{4} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nSince $k_{r,T}=0$ and $k_{\\mathrm{RISC}}=0$, the formula simplifies:\n$$\n\\eta_{\\mathrm{rad, fluo}} = \\frac{k_{r,S}(p_S k_{T,decay})}{k_{S,decay}k_{T,decay} + k_{T,decay}k_{\\mathrm{ISC}}} = \\frac{k_{r,S} p_S}{k_{S,decay} + k_{\\mathrm{ISC}}} = p_S \\frac{k_{r,S}}{k_{r,S} + k_{nr,S} + k_{\\mathrm{ISC}}}\n$$\n$$\n\\eta_{\\mathrm{rad, fluo}} = 0.25 \\times \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{8}}{1.0 \\times 10^{8} + 1.0 \\times 10^{7} + 1.0 \\times 10^{6}} = 0.25 \\times \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{8}}{1.11 \\times 10^{8}} = \\frac{0.25}{1.11} \\approx 0.225225...\n$$\n\nCase 2: Phosphorescent OLED\nGiven rates: $k_{r,S} = 5.0 \\times 10^{6} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $k_{nr,S} = 1.0 \\times 10^{7} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $k_{\\mathrm{ISC}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{8} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $k_{r,T} = 5.0 \\times 10^{5} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $k_{nr,T} = 1.0 \\times 10^{4} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $k_{\\mathrm{RISC}} = 0 \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n$k_{S,decay} = 5.0 \\times 10^{6} + 1.0 \\times 10^{7} = 1.5 \\times 10^{7} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n$k_{T,decay} = 5.0 \\times 10^{5} + 1.0 \\times 10^{4} = 5.1 \\times 10^{5} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nSince $k_{\\mathrm{RISC}}=0$, the formula simplifies to:\n$$\n\\eta_{\\mathrm{rad, phos}} = \\frac{k_{r,S}(p_S k_{T,decay}) + k_{r,T}(p_T k_{S,decay} + k_{\\mathrm{ISC}})}{k_{S,decay}k_{T,decay} + k_{T,decay}k_{\\mathrm{ISC}}} = \\frac{k_{r,S} p_S k_{T,decay} + k_{r,T}(p_T k_{S,decay} + k_{\\mathrm{ISC}})}{k_{T,decay}(k_{S,decay} + k_{\\mathrm{ISC}})}\n$$\nNumerator: $(5.0 \\times 10^{6})(0.25)(5.1 \\times 10^{5}) + (5.0 \\times 10^{5})(0.75 \\times 1.5 \\times 10^{7} + 5.0 \\times 10^{8}) = 6.375 \\times 10^{11} + (5.0 \\times 10^{5})(5.1125 \\times 10^{8}) = 6.375 \\times 10^{11} + 2.55625 \\times 10^{14} \\approx 2.562625 \\times 10^{14}$.\nDenominator: $(5.1 \\times 10^{5})(1.5 \\times 10^{7} + 5.0 \\times 10^{8}) = (5.1 \\times 10^{5})(5.15 \\times 10^{8}) = 2.6265 \\times 10^{14}$.\n$$\n\\eta_{\\mathrm{rad, phos}} = \\frac{2.562625 \\times 10^{14}}{2.6265 \\times 10^{14}} \\approx 0.975662...\n$$\n\nCase 3: TADF OLED\nGiven rates: $k_{r,S} = 7.0 \\times 10^{7} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $k_{nr,S} = 5.0 \\times 10^{6} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $k_{\\mathrm{ISC}} = 2.0 \\times 10^{6} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $k_{r,T} = 0 \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $k_{nr,T} = 5.0 \\times 10^{4} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, $k_{\\mathrm{RISC}} = 1.0 \\times 10^{6} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n$k_{S,decay} = 7.0 \\times 10^{7} + 5.0 \\times 10^{6} = 7.5 \\times 10^{7} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n$k_{T,decay} = 0 + 5.0 \\times 10^{4} = 5.0 \\times 10^{4} \\, \\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\nAll terms in the general formula are necessary except for those involving $k_{r,T}$, which is zero.\n$$\n\\eta_{\\mathrm{rad, TADF}} = \\frac{k_{r,S}(p_S k_{T,decay} + k_{\\mathrm{RISC}})}{k_{S,decay}k_{T,decay} + k_{S,decay}k_{\\mathrm{RISC}} + k_{T,decay}k_{\\mathrm{ISC}}}\n$$\nNumerator: $(7.0 \\times 10^{7})(0.25 \\times 5.0 \\times 10^{4} + 1.0 \\times 10^{6}) = (7.0 \\times 10^{7})(1.25 \\times 10^{4} + 1.0 \\times 10^{6}) = (7.0 \\times 10^{7})(1.0125 \\times 10^{6}) = 7.0875 \\times 10^{13}$.\nDenominator: $(7.5 \\times 10^{7})(5.0 \\times 10^{4}) + (7.5 \\times 10^{7})(1.0 \\times 10^{6}) + (5.0 \\times 10^{4})(2.0 \\times 10^{6}) = 3.75 \\times 10^{12} + 7.5 \\times 10^{13} + 1.0 \\times 10^{11} = 0.375 \\times 10^{13} + 7.5 \\times 10^{13} + 0.01 \\times 10^{13} = 7.885 \\times 10^{13}$.\n$$\n\\eta_{\\mathrm{rad, TADF}} = \\frac{7.0875 \\times 10^{13}}{7.885 \\times 10^{13}} \\approx 0.898858...\n$$\nThe three numerical values, rounded to four significant figures, are $0.2252$ (fluorescent), $0.9757$ (phosphorescent), and $0.8989$ (TADF).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.2252  0.9757  0.8989 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2504527"}]}
