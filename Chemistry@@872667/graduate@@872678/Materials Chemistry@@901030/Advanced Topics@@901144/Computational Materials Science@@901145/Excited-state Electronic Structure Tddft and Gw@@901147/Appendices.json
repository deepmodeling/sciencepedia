A rigorous solution will be developed.\n\nThe excitation energies $\\Omega$ within adiabatic linear-response TDDFT are found by solving the following non-Hermitian eigenvalue problem, often called Casida's equation:\n$$\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{A} & \\mathbf{B} \\\\ \\mathbf{B}^* & \\mathbf{A}^* \\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{X} \\\\ \\mathbf{Y} \\end{pmatrix}\n= \\Omega\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{1} & \\mathbf{0} \\\\ \\mathbf{0} & -\\mathbf{1} \\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\mathbf{X} \\\\ \\mathbf{Y} \\end{pmatrix}\n$$\nThe problem specifies that we are not making the Tamm–Dancoff approximation, which means the matrix $\\mathbf{B}$ is not neglected. For a system with a single occupied-virtual pair $(i, a)$, the matrices $\\mathbf{A}$ and $\\mathbf{B}$ become scalars. The orbitals are assumed to be real, as is typical for non-magnetic closed-shell molecules.\n\nThe matrix elements for a singlet excitation are given by:\n$$ A_{ia,jb} = \\delta_{ij}\\delta_{ab}(\\varepsilon_{a} - \\varepsilon_{i}) + 2 K_{ia,jb} $$\n$$ B_{ia,jb} = 2 K_{ia,bj} $$\nwhere $K_{ia,jb}$ is the coupling matrix element involving the Hxc kernel $f_{Hxc}$:\n$$ K_{ia,jb} = \\iint \\phi_{i}(\\mathbf{r})\\phi_{a}(\\mathbf{r}) f_{Hxc}(\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{r}') \\phi_{j}(\\mathbf{r}')\\phi_{b}(\\mathbf{r}') \\, d\\mathbf{r} \\, d\\mathbf{r}' $$\nThe factor of $2$ arises from the spin-restricted formalism for singlet excitations.\n\nIn our specific two-level model, there is only one transition $i \\to a$. The matrices $A$ and $B$ are thus $1 \\times 1$ scalars.\n$$ A = (\\varepsilon_{a} - \\varepsilon_{i}) + 2 K_{ia,ia} = \\omega_{s} + 2 K_{ia,ia} $$\n$$ B = 2 K_{ia,ai} $$\nThe transition density is defined as $P(\\mathbf{r}) = \\phi_{i}(\\mathbf{r})\\phi_{a}(\\mathbf{r})$. Using this definition, the coupling matrix element $K_{ia,ia}$ is:\n$$ K_{ia,ia} = \\iint P(\\mathbf{r}) f_{Hxc}(\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{r}') P(\\mathbf{r}') \\, d\\mathbf{r} \\, d\\mathbf{r}' $$\nThe kernel $f_{Hxc}(\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{r}') = \\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}'|} + \\beta\\delta(\\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}')$.

We shall operate in atomic units where energy is in Hartrees and distance is in Bohrs.\n\nFirst, we establish the exact CT excitation energy, $\\omega^{\\mathrm{exact}}(R)$, for a transition from a donor fragment $D$ to an acceptor fragment $A$. A CT excitation promotes an electron from $D$ to $A$, transforming the neutral system $D^{0}A^{0}$ into an ionic pair $D^{+}A^{-}$. The excitation energy is the difference in the total energies of the final and initial states:\n$$\n\\omega^{\\mathrm{exact}} = E(D^{+}A^{-}) - E(D^{0}A^{0})\n$$\nAt a large separation $R$, the interaction between the neutral fragments is negligible, so the initial state energy is the sum of the energies of the isolated fragments, $E(D^{0}A^{0}) \\approx E(D^{0}) + E(A^{0})$.

The problem states that this excitation is modeled as a single Kohn-Sham (KS) orbital transition from the donor's highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), which we denote $\\phi_{H}^{D}$ with energy $\\epsilon_{H}^{D}$, to the acceptor's lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), $\\phi_{L}^{A}$ with energy $\\epsilon_{L}^{A}$. In the framework of linear-response TDDFT, the excitation energies $\\omega$ are eigenvalues of the Casida equations.

The donor HOMO $\\phi_{H}^{D}$ is localized on fragment $D$, and the acceptor LUMO $\\phi_{L}^{A}$ is localized on fragment $A$. For large $R$, the spatial overlap between these two orbitals is exponentially small. Consequently, the product density $\\phi_{H}^{D}(\\mathbf{r}) \\phi_{L}^{A}(\\mathbf{r})$ is exponentially small everywhere in space. Both the Hartree and the local XC contributions to the kernel $K_{ia,ia}$ depend on integrals over such product densities.

For each knob, take half of the last increment as the residual error and sum the three contributions linearly for each band edge...**\n- This option violates Practice 2 (by taking half the increment), Practice 3 (by summing linearly), and Practice 4 (by summing linearly for the gap). The methodology is fundamentally incorrect according to the problem constraints.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**B. Choose $\\left(6\\times 6\\times 6\\right)$, $E_{\\mathrm{cut}}^{\\epsilon}=16\\,\\mathrm{Ry}$, $N_b=400$, because the combined-screening test suggests small net changes due to cancellation...**\n- This option chooses unconverged parameters, which is poor practice. It also bases its reasoning on a fortuitous cancellation, which the problem statement explicitly advises against. The error assignment of $<0.010\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ is arbitrary and not derived from the data according to the given rules.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Choose $\\left(8\\times 8\\times 8\\right)$, $E_{\\mathrm{cut}}^{\\epsilon}=24\\,\\mathrm{Ry}$, $N_b=800$. For each band edge, take the absolute last-step changes as independent uncertainties from $\\mathbf{k}$-points, $E_{\\mathrm{cut}}^{\\epsilon}$, and $N_b$, then combine in quadrature.

It correctly applies Practice 2 (uses full last increment), Practice 3 (combines in quadrature for band edges), and Practice 4 (combines in quadrature for the gap). The calculations performed match our derivation precisely.\n- **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Choose $\\left(8\\times 8\\times 8\\right)$, $E_{\\mathrm{cut}}^{\\epsilon}=24\\,\\mathrm{Ry}$, $N_b=800$, and sum the full last-step increments linearly to be maximally conservative...**\n- This option correctly chooses the parameters and correctly applies Practice 2. However, it violates Practice 3 and Practice 4 by summing uncertainties linearly instead of in quadrature. The justification of being \"maximally conservative\" is an alternative error propagation philosophy, but it is not the one prescribed by the problem statement.\n- **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2486746"}]}
