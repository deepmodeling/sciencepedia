The exponents are dimensionless and require no units.", "solution": "The problem requires the derivation of scaling laws for the effective Young's modulus and plastic collapse strength of an open-cell foam, first for a monolithic structure, and then for a hierarchical structure. The analysis will be based on the provided assumptions: bending-dominated deformation and plastic yielding in bending as the collapse mechanism. The derivation for the monolithic case will establish the foundational scaling relationships, which will then be applied recursively to solve the hierarchical case.\n\nFirst, we must establish the relationship between the relative density $r$ and the geometric parameters of the foam struts, which are their length $l$ and thickness $t$. The relative density $r$ is defined as the ratio of the foam density $\\rho^{\\ast}$ to the solid density $\\rho_s$, which is equivalent to the volume fraction of the solid material.\n$r = \\frac{\\rho^{\\ast}}{\\rho_s} = \\frac{V_{\\text{solid}}}{V_{\\text{total}}}$\nThe volume of the struts in a representative unit cell of the foam is proportional to the total length of the struts multiplied by their cross-sectional area, $A \\propto t^2$. The total volume of the unit cell is proportional to $l^3$. The total length of struts within a unit cell of side length $l$ is itself proportional to $l$. Thus, $V_{\\text{solid}} \\propto l \\cdot t^2$. The total volume is $V_{\\text{total}} \\propto l^3$.\nThe relative density therefore scales as:\n$$r \\propto \\frac{l t^2}{l^3} = \\left(\\frac{t}{l}\\right)^2$$\nThis fundamental geometric relationship implies that the strut aspect ratio scales with the square root of the relative density:\n$$\\frac{t}{l} \\propto r^{1/2}$$\n\nPart 1: Monolithic Foam\n\nWe derive the scaling exponents $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ for the monolithic foam.\n\nDerivation of the Young's Modulus Scaling ($E/E_s \\sim r^{\\alpha}$):\nThe macroscopic Young's modulus $E$ is the ratio of macroscopic stress $\\sigma_{foam}$ to macroscopic strain $\\epsilon_{foam}$. When the foam is subjected to a stress $\\sigma_{foam}$, the forces on the individual struts are proportional to this stress and the square of the cell size, $F \\propto \\sigma_{foam} l^2$.\nSince the deformation is bending-dominated, the deflection $\\delta$ of a strut of length $l$ under a load $F$ is given by Euler-Bernoulli beam theory:\n$$\\delta \\propto \\frac{F l^3}{E_s I}$$\nwhere $E_s$ is the Young's modulus of the solid material and $I$ is the second moment of area of the strut's cross-section. For a square cross-section of thickness $t$, $I \\propto t^4$.\nThe macroscopic strain in the foam is proportional to the strut deflection normalized by the strut length, $\\epsilon_{foam} \\propto \\delta/l$.\nCombining these relations gives:\n$$\\epsilon_{foam} \\propto \\frac{\\delta}{l} \\propto \\frac{F l^2}{E_s I} \\propto \\frac{(\\sigma_{foam} l^2) l^2}{E_s t^4} = \\sigma_{foam} \\frac{l^4}{E_s t^4}$$\nThe effective modulus $E = \\sigma_{foam}/\\epsilon_{foam}$ is then:\n$$E = \\frac{\\sigma_{foam}}{\\epsilon_{foam}} \\propto E_s \\left(\\frac{t}{l}\\right)^4$$\nSubstituting the geometric relation $(t/l) \\propto r^{1/2}$:\n$$E \\propto E_s (r^{1/2})^4 = E_s r^2$$\nThus, the scaling relation is $E/E_s \\propto r^2$, and the exponent is $\\alpha = 2$.\n\nDerivation of the Plastic Collapse Strength Scaling ($\\sigma/\\sigma_s \\sim r^{\\beta}$):\nPlastic collapse occurs when the maximum stress in a strut reaches the yield strength of the solid, $\\sigma_s$. The maximum stress in a bent beam occurs at the outer surface and is given by $\\sigma_{max} = My/I$, where $M$ is the bending moment, $y$ is the distance from the neutral axis, and $I$ is the second moment of area.\nThe bending moment is proportional to the applied force and strut length, $M \\propto F l$. The distance $y$ is proportional to the thickness, $y \\propto t$. As before, $I \\propto t^4$.\nThe force $F$ in the strut is related to the macroscopic foam stress $\\sigma_{foam}$ by $F \\propto \\sigma_{foam} l^2$.\nThe maximum stress in the strut is therefore:\n$$\\sigma_{max} \\propto \\frac{(F l) t}{I} \\propto \\frac{(\\sigma_{foam} l^2) l t}{t^4} = \\sigma_{foam} \\frac{l^3}{t^3}$$\nCollapse occurs when $\\sigma_{max}$ reaches $\\sigma_s$, which defines the macroscopic collapse strength, which we denote as $\\sigma$.\n$$\\sigma_s \\propto \\sigma \\left(\\frac{l}{t}\\right)^3$$\nRearranging for the macroscopic collapse strength $\\sigma$:\n$$\\sigma \\propto \\sigma_s \\left(\\frac{t}{l}\\right)^3$$\nSubstituting the geometric relation $(t/l) \\propto r^{1/2}$:\n$$\\sigma \\propto \\sigma_s (r^{1/2})^3 = \\sigma_s r^{3/2}$$\nThus, the scaling relation is $\\sigma/\\sigma_s \\propto r^{3/2}$, and the exponent is $\\beta = 3/2$.\n\nPart 2: Hierarchical Foam\n\nNow we analyze the two-level hierarchical structure. The macro-struts are themselves open-cell foams (micro-foam).\nLet the properties of the solid be $E_s, \\sigma_s, \\rho_s$.\nLet the properties of the micro-foam (which constitutes the macro-struts) be $E_m, \\sigma_m, \\rho_m$. The relative density of this micro-foam with respect to the solid is $\\eta = \\rho_m/\\rho_s$.\nLet the properties of the final hierarchical foam be $E, \\sigma, \\rho^{\\ast}$. The relative density of this macro-foam with respect to its constituent micro-foam material is $\\lambda = \\rho^{\\ast}/\\rho_m$.\nThe total relative density is $r = \\rho^{\\ast}/\\rho_s = (\\rho^{\\ast}/\\rho_m) (\\rho_m/\\rho_s) = \\lambda \\eta$.\n\nThe problem states that both levels are bending-dominated. We can therefore apply the scaling laws derived in Part 1 sequentially.\n\nProperties of the Micro-Foam Material (Level 1):\nThe micro-foam is a cellular solid with relative density $\\eta$. Its properties are determined by scaling the solid properties $E_s$ and $\\sigma_s$ using the exponents $\\alpha=2$ and $\\beta=3/2$.\n$$E_m \\propto E_s \\eta^{\\alpha} = E_s \\eta^2$$\n$$\\sigma_m \\propto \\sigma_s \\eta^{\\beta} = \\sigma_s \\eta^{3/2}$$\n\nProperties of the Hierarchical Foam (Level 2):\nThe hierarchical foam is a cellular solid with relative density $\\lambda$ made from a material with properties $E_m$ and $\\sigma_m$. We apply the same scaling laws, but a second time, using $E_m$ and $\\sigma_m$ as the properties of the \"solid\".\nThe effective modulus $E$ of the final structure is:\n$$E \\propto E_m \\lambda^{\\alpha} = E_m \\lambda^2$$\nSubstituting the expression for $E_m$:\n$$E \\propto (E_s \\eta^2) \\lambda^2 = E_s (\\eta \\lambda)^2$$\nSince the total relative density is $r = \\eta\\lambda$, we have:\n$$E \\propto E_s r^2$$\nThis implies that the modified exponent for the Young's modulus is $\\alpha_h = 2$.\n\nThe effective plastic collapse strength $\\sigma$ of the final structure is:\n$$\\sigma \\propto \\sigma_m \\lambda^{\\beta} = \\sigma_m \\lambda^{3/2}$$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\sigma_m$:\n$$\\sigma \\propto (\\sigma_s \\eta^{3/2}) \\lambda^{3/2} = \\sigma_s (\\eta \\lambda)^{3/2}$$\nUsing $r = \\eta\\lambda$:\n$$\\sigma \\propto \\sigma_s r^{3/2}$$\nThis implies that the modified exponent for plastic collapse strength is $\\beta_h = 3/2$.\n\nThe ordered pair of modified exponents is therefore $(\\alpha_h, \\beta_h) = (2, 3/2)$. It is a crucial observation that, under the strict and idealized assumption that both hierarchical levels remain bending-dominated, the scaling exponents for modulus and strength do not change compared to the monolithic case. The modification manifests in the pre-factors, not the exponents. The problem is constructed to test adherence to the given physical model, not to import more complex phenomena like buckling or mode-switching, which are not mentioned and are implicitly excluded by the explicit assumption of bending-dominance at all levels.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n2 & \\frac{3}{2}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2470316"}, {"introduction": "The remarkable properties of many biological materials, such as nacre, arise from their exquisite hierarchical structure, which is formed through precisely controlled mineralization.

This will be addressed in three parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the steady-state flux and growth velocity.\n\nUnder steady-state conditions, the molar flux of growth units, $J$, must be constant throughout the diffusion layer of thickness $h$. According to Fick's first law in one dimension, this diffusive flux is related to the concentration gradient:\n$$\nJ = -D \\frac{dc}{dz}\n$$\nHere, we define $J$ as the magnitude of the flux in the direction of the crystal surface (i.e., in the $-z$ direction), so we write $J = D \\frac{dc}{dz}$ considering the concentration gradient is positive from $z=0$ to $z=h$. This is a sign convention choice, the physics remains identical. Let us adopt the more standard convention where flux is positive in the direction of decreasing coordinate. The flux is directed from $z=h$ to $z=0$, so its component $J_z$ is negative.\n$$\nJ_z = -D \\frac{dc}{dz}\n$$\nSince the flux is constant at steady state, we can integrate this equation across the slit from the crystal surface at $z=0$ to the replenishment source at $z=h$:\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{h} J_z dz = \\int_{c(0)}^{c(h)} -D dc\n$$\nLet $c_s = c(0)$ be the concentration at the crystal surface and $c_{\\infty} = c(h)$ be the concentration at the top of the slit. The integration yields:\n$$\nJ_z h = -D (c_{\\infty} - c_s)\n$$\nThe magnitude of the flux reaching the surface is $J = -J_z$. Therefore:\n$$\nJ = \\frac{D}{h} (c_{\\infty} - c_s)\n$$\nThis equation relates the flux to the diffusive transport across the slit.\n\nAt the crystal surface ($z=0$), the flux is also governed by the first-order surface-integration kinetics. The problem states this incorporation flux is $J_{\\text{surf}} = k_s c_s$. At steady state, the diffusive flux arriving at the surface must be equal to the rate of incorporation into the crystal lattice:\n$$\nJ = J_{\\text{surf}} = k_s c_s\n$$\nWe now have a system of two linear equations for the two unknowns, $J$ and $c_s$:\n1. $J = \\frac{D}{h} (c_{\\infty} - c_s)$\n2. $J = k_s c_s$\n\nFrom equation (2), we can express $c_s$ as $c_s = \\frac{J}{k_s}$.

The problem states $\\mathrm{Da}$ is the ratio of the characteristic reaction rate to the characteristic diffusion rate. The characteristic \"speed\" of the surface reaction is $k_s$, while the characteristic \"speed\" of diffusion across the slit is $D/h$. Thus, the dimensionless Damköhler number is:\n$$\n\\mathrm{Da} = \\frac{\\text{reaction rate}}{\\text{diffusion rate}} = \\frac{k_s}{D/h} = \\frac{k_s h}{D}\n$$\nWe can now rewrite the expression for $J$ by dividing the numerator and denominator by $D$:\n$$\nJ = c_{\\infty} \\frac{k_s}{1 + \\frac{h k_s}{D}} = \\frac{k_s c_{\\infty}}{1 + \\mathrm{Da}}\n$$\nThe normal growth velocity $v$ is given by $v = v_m J$.

Any growth unit that diffuses to the surface is instantly incorporated. The surface concentration $c_s = J/k_s$ approaches zero. The overall process is therefore limited by the rate at which growth units can be supplied by diffusion across the slit. This is the **diffusion-limited** regime.\n\nSurface-integration-limited regime ($\\mathrm{Da} \\ll 1$):\nThis condition implies $\\mathrm{Da} = \\frac{k_s h}{D} \\ll 1$, meaning the surface reaction is very slow compared to diffusion.

Therefore, the work of separation is:\n$$\nG_c = K_0 \\delta_0^2\n$$\n\nWe now have a system of two algebraic equations relating the physical invariants $(\\sigma_{\\max}, G_c)$ to the model parameters $(K_0, \\delta_0)$:\n1. $\\sigma_{\\max} = K_0 \\delta_0 e^{-1}$\n2. $G_c = K_0 \\delta_0^2$\n\nThis system must be solved for $K_0$ and $\\delta_0$. From equation (1), we can express $K_0$ as $K_0 = e \\sigma_{\\max} / \\delta_0$. Substituting this into equation (2):\n$$\nG_c = \\left(\\frac{e \\sigma_{\\max}}{\\delta_0}\\right) \\delta_0^2 = e \\sigma_{\\max} \\delta_0\n$$\nThis yields a direct expression for the characteristic separation $\\delta_0$:\n$$\n\\delta_0 = \\frac{G_c}{e \\sigma_{\\max}}\n$$\nSubstituting this result back into the expression for $K_0$:\n$$\nK_0 = \\frac{e \\sigma_{\\max}}{\\delta_0} = \\frac{e \\sigma_{\\max}}{G_c / (e \\sigma_{\\max})} = \\frac{e^2 \\sigma_{\\max}^2}{G_c}\n$$\nThese are the analytical formulas for the CZM parameters.\n\nThe problem requires a numerical procedure. For each test case $(\\sigma_{\\mathrm{pk}}, \\beta)$:\n1. A discrete traction-separation dataset $(\\delta_i, T_{\\mathrm{atom}}(\\delta_i))$ is generated for $N=400$ points over the interval $\\delta \\in [0, 5/\\beta]$ using the function $T_{\\mathrm{atom}}(\\delta) = \\sigma_{\\mathrm{pk}}\\,\\beta\\,e\\,\\delta\\,\\exp(-\\beta \\delta)$.\n2. The peak traction $\\sigma_{\\max}$ is determined by finding the maximum value in the discrete set $\\{T_{\\mathrm{atom}}(\\delta_i)\\}$.\n3. The work of separation $G_c$ is calculated by numerically integrating the discrete data $(\\delta_i, T_{\\mathrm{atom}}(\\delta_i))$ using the trapezoidal rule over the specified truncated domain.\n4. The numerically obtained values for $\\sigma_{\\max}$ and $G_c$ are then used in the derived formulas to compute the parameters $\\delta_0$ and $K_0$.\n5. The continuum law $T_{\\mathrm{cont}}(\\delta) = K_0\\,\\delta\\,\\exp(-\\delta/\\delta_0)$ is evaluated at each grid point $\\delta_i$.\n6. The maximum absolute deviation is calculated as $\\varepsilon_{\\max} = \\max_i |T_{\\mathrm{cont}}(\\delta_i) - T_{\\mathrm{atom}}(\\delta_i)|$.", "answer": "[0.248733,21.848832,0.006673,0.082911,267.369877,0.002224,0.662889,4.448555,0.004445]", "id": "2470294"}]}
