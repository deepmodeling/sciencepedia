The solution process may proceed.\n\nThe solution requires combining the formula for capillary force with the formula for beam deflection. The resist line is modeled as a vertical cantilever beam fixed to the substrate. Its length is the line height, so the beam length is $l_{\\text{beam}} = t$. The capillary force is simplified to a single point load, $F_{\\text{cap}}$, applied at the free end of the beam, which is its top edge at height $t$.\n\nThe magnitude of the capillary force, $F_{\\text{cap}}$, must be determined.

The parameter $E$ is the Young's modulus, and $I$ is the second moment of area of the beam's cross-section. The cross-section is a rectangle with dimensions $L \\times w$. The beam bends \"laterally,\" meaning in the direction of its width $w$. The neutral axis for this bending is therefore parallel to the dimension $L$.
