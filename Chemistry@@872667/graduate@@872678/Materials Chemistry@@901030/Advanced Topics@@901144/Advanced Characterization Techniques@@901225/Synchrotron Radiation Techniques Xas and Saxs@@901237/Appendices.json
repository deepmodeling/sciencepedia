It is a standard, fundamental exercise in the physics of scattering.

We are interested in the magnitude of the scattering vector, $q = |\\mathbf{q}|$. We can find its square, $q^2$, by taking the dot product of $\\mathbf{q}$ with itself:\n$$ q^2 = \\mathbf{q} \\cdot \\mathbf{q} = (\\mathbf{k}_{s} - \\mathbf{k}_{i}) \\cdot (\\mathbf{k}_{s} - \\mathbf{k}_{i}) $$\nExpanding the dot product yields:\n$$ q^2 = \\mathbf{k}_{s} \\cdot \\mathbf{k}_{s} - 2(\\mathbf{k}_{i} \\cdot \\mathbf{k}_{s}) + \\mathbf{k}_{i} \\cdot \\mathbf{k}_{i} $$\nThe dot product of a vector with itself is the square of its magnitude. Thus, $\\mathbf{k}_{i} \\cdot \\mathbf{k}_{i} = |\\mathbf{k}_{i}|^2 = k^2$ and $\\mathbf{k}_{s} \\cdot \\mathbf{k}_{s} = |\\mathbf{k}_{s}|^2 = k^2$. The dot product $\\mathbf{k}_{i} \\cdot \\mathbf{k}_{s}$ is given by $|\\mathbf{k}_{i}||\\mathbf{k}_{s}|\\cos(2\\theta)$, where $2\\theta$ is the angle between the two vectors.\nSubstituting these into the expression for $q^2$:\n$$ q^2 = k^2 - 2(k \\cdot k \\cos(2\\theta)) + k^2 $$\n$$ q^2 = 2k^2 - 2k^2\\cos(2\\theta) = 2k^2(1 - \\cos(2\\theta)) $$\nThis is an expression of the law of cosines applied to the vector triangle. To simplify, we employ the half-angle trigonometric identity $1 - \\cos(2\\alpha) = 2\\sin^2(\\alpha)$. With $\\alpha = \\theta$, we get:\n$$ q^2 = 2k^2(2\\sin^2(\\theta)) = 4k^2\\sin^2(\\theta) $$\nTaking the square root of both sides gives the magnitude $q$. Since $q$ is a magnitude, it must be non-negative. For physical scattering, $\\theta \\in [0, \\pi/2]$, so $\\sin(\\theta) \\ge 0$.\n$$ q = 2k\\sin(\\theta) $$\nFinally, we substitute the definition of the wavevector magnitude, $k = 2\\pi/\\lambda$:\n$$ q = 2\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\right)\\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{4\\pi}{\\lambda}\\sin(\\theta) $$\nThis completes the required derivation.\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- Wavelength $\\lambda = 1.0\\ \\mathrm{\\AA}$.\n- Scattering angle $2\\theta = 0.5^\\circ$.\n\nFirst, all units must be converted to a consistent system for the final answer.

We use the unrounded value of $q$ for this calculation to maintain precision.\n$$ \\ell \\approx \\frac{2\\pi}{q} \\approx \\frac{2\\pi}{0.548296\\ \\mathrm{nm}^{-1}} $$\n$$ \\ell \\approx 11.4591\\ \\mathrm{nm} $$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$ \\ell \\approx 11.46\\ \\mathrm{nm} $$\nThe problem asks for the final answer as a two-component row vector $(q, \\ell)$.

We are instructed to use first-order uncertainty propagation for a function of a single variable.

Since the calculated value is exactly $200$, it is already in the required form.\n\nNow, I will discuss the trade-offs involved in selecting the sample thickness $t$. The quality of an XAS spectrum is determined by the signal-to-noise ratio ($SNR$). The signal in XAS is the absorption, and the dominant noise is typically photon shot noise, where the standard deviation in photon count $N$ is $\\sqrt{N}$. The relative error in an intensity measurement is thus proportional to $1/\\sqrt{I}$. The error in absorbance, $\\delta A$, is found by propagating the errors from the incident intensity $I_0$ and transmitted intensity $I$.\n$$\\delta A = \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\delta I_0}{I_0}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\delta I}{I}\\right)^2}$$\nAssuming constant counting time, $\\delta I_0 \\propto \\sqrt{I_0}$ and $\\delta I \\propto \\sqrt{I}$. Because $I = I_0 \\exp(-A)$, the error becomes:\n$$\\delta A \\propto \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{I_0} + \\frac{1}{I}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{I_0} + \\frac{\\exp(A)}{I_0}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{I_0}}\\sqrt{1 + \\exp(A)}$$\nThe quality of the data is related to the relative error in the absorption coefficient, $\\delta\\mu/\\mu = (\\delta A/t)/(\\mu) = (\\delta A/t)/(A/t) = \\delta A/A$. To maximize data quality, one must minimize this relative error, which is proportional to $\\frac{\\sqrt{1 + \\exp(A)}}{A}$. This function has a minimum at a total absorbance $A \\approx 2.2$. The target condition $\\Delta A = 1$ leads to a total absorbance just above the edge of $A(E_{\\mathrm{post}}) = \\mu(E_{\\mathrm{post}})t_{\\mathrm{opt}} = (100\\ \\mathrm{cm}^{-1})(0.02\\ \\mathrm{cm}) = 2$. Thus, the condition $\\Delta A = 1$ is not arbitrary; it positions the most critical part of the spectrum (the post-edge region) in the optimal absorbance range for minimizing statistical noise.\n\nLet us analyze the trade-offs by considering deviations from this optimal thickness.\n\nCase 1: $t \\ll t_{\\mathrm{opt}}$ (thin sample).\n-   Transmitted Intensity: Absorbance $A(E) = \\mu(E)t$ is low, thus $I(E) \\approx I_0(E)$. The transmitted intensity is high, which is favorable for photon statistics on the transmission detector.\n-   Statistical Noise: The edge step $\\Delta A = (\\Delta\\mu)t$ is much less than $1$. The signal, which is the change in absorption, is very weak. We are measuring a small difference between two large numbers ($I_0$ and $I$). Any instability in the incident beam or small systematic errors in background subtraction will be magnified relative to the small signal, leading to a poor $SNR$ for the absorption coefficient.\n-   Detector Dynamic Range: This is not a problem, as $I_0$ and $I$ are of similar magnitude.\n-   Spectral Distortions: Less susceptible to thickness-induced distortions, but the low signal magnitude makes the spectrum vulnerable to other systematic errors.\n\nCase 2: $t \\gg t_{\\mathrm{opt}}$ (thick sample).\n-   Transmitted Intensity: The absorbance $A(E_{\\mathrm{post}}) = \\mu(E_{\\mathrm{post}})t$ becomes very large ($A \\gg 2$). The transmitted intensity $I = I_0 \\exp(-A)$ becomes extremely low, a condition known as \"photon starvation\".\n-   Statistical Noise: With very few photons reaching the detector, the shot noise $\\sqrt{I}$ becomes a large fraction of the signal $I$. The relative error $1/\\sqrt{I}$ becomes enormous, catastrophically degrading the $SNR$ of the absorbance measurement.\n-   Detector Dynamic Range: This poses a severe challenge. The detector system must measure a very high $I_0$ signal and a near-zero $I$ signal. The dark current and electronic noise of the detector can easily overwhelm the minuscule photon signal from $I$, rendering the measurement meaningless.\n-   Spectral Distortions: Thick samples are notoriously prone to severe spectral distortions. If the sample thickness is non-uniform, regions with lower thickness (\"pinholes\") will transmit disproportionately more photons, causing a significant underestimation of the true average absorbance. Furthermore, higher-energy harmonics from the monochromator, which are less strongly absorbed, can pass through the sample and contaminate the $I$ signal, artificially flattening the measured absorption spectrum.\n\nIn summary, the choice of $t_{\\mathrm{opt}}$ such that $\\Delta A \\approx 1$ provides a robust compromise. It yields a signal that is strong enough to be measured accurately above background and systematic errors, while ensuring sufficient photon flux transmits through the sample to maintain good counting statistics and avoid the severe problems associated with detector dynamic range and spectral distortions common to overly thick samples. The fact that this practical rule of thumb leads to a total post-edge absorbance near the theoretical optimum of $A \\approx 2.2$ confirms its validity from first principles.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{200}$$", "id": "2528557"}]}
