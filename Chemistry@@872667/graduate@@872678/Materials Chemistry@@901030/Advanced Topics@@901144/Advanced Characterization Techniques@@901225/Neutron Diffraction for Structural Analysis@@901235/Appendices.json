The magnitude of the wavevector, $k$, is related to the de Broglie wavelength $\\lambda$ by the relation:\n$$k = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}$$\nIn elastic scattering, the kinetic energy of the neutron is conserved. Consequently, the magnitude of its momentum, and thus the magnitude of its wavevector, remains unchanged. If $\\vec{k}_i$ is the incident wavevector and $\\vec{k}_f$ is the scattered wavevector, then:\n$$|\\vec{k}_i| = |\\vec{k}_f| = k$$\nDiffraction occurs when the scattering vector, defined as the change in the wavevector $\\vec{Q} = \\vec{k}_f - \\vec{k}_i$, is equal to a vector of the reciprocal lattice, $\\vec{G}_{hkl}$.\n$$\\vec{k}_f - \\vec{k}_i = \\vec{G}_{hkl}$$\nThis is the Laue condition for diffraction.

It presents a standard theoretical problem in solid-state physics and crystallography without any factual errors, internal contradictions, or ambiguities. All necessary data are provided. Thus, a solution will be provided.\n\nThe coherent nuclear structure factor, $F_{N}$, for a crystal structure is defined by summing the scattering contributions from all atoms within a unit cell, taking into account their respective scattering lengths and phase factors determined by their positions. For a reflection indexed by Miller indices $(h,k,l)$, the structure factor is given by:\n$$F_{N}(h,k,l) = \\sum_{j} b_j e^{i 2\\pi (h x_j + k y_j + l z_j)}$$\nwhere the sum is over all atoms $j$ in the conventional unit cell, $b_j$ is the coherent nuclear scattering length of atom $j$, and $(x_j, y_j, z_j)$ are its fractional coordinates within the cell.\n\nThe problem specifies a rock-salt structure, which has a face-centered cubic (FCC) Bravais lattice and a two-atom basis. The atomic positions within the entire conventional cell can be generated by taking the four lattice point positions of the FCC cell and adding the basis atom vectors to each. This allows the total structure factor to be expressed as the product of a lattice factor, $S_{\\text{lattice}}$, and a basis structure factor, $F_{\\text{basis}}$:\n$$F_{N}(h,k,l) = S_{\\text{lattice}}(h,k,l) \\times F_{\\text{basis}}(h,k,l)$$\n\nFirst, we derive the basis structure factor, $F_{\\text{basis}}$. The basis consists of a sodium atom (Na) at $\\mathbf{r}_{\\text{Na}} = (0,0,0)$ and a chlorine atom (Cl) at $\\mathbf{r}_{\\text{Cl}} = (\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{2})$.

It evaluates to $4$ if the indices $h, k, l$ are all even or all odd (unmixed parity), and to $0$ if they have mixed parity. The condition $S_{\\text{lattice}} = 0$ corresponds to a forbidden reflection.\n\nCombining the basis and lattice factors, we obtain the total nuclear structure factor for NaCl:\n$$F_{N}(h,k,l) = \\left( b_{\\text{Na}} + b_{\\text{Cl}} (-1)^{h+k+l} \\right) \\left( 1 + (-1)^{h+k} + (-1)^{h+l} + (-1)^{k+l} \\right)$$\nThis is a single, closed-form expression that fulfills all requirements of the problem.
