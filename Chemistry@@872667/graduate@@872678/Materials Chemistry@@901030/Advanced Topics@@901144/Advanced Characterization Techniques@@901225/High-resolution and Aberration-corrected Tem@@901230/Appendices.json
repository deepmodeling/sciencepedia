The concepts of chromatic aberration, temporal coherence, and the contrast transfer function are standard. The provided values for the microscope parameters are realistic. The given equations are standard representations, though the one for chromatic defocus is a non-relativistic approximation.

A unique solution exists.\n- **Objectivity**: The problem is formulated in objective, scientific language.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. It specifies the model to be used by providing key equations and indicating which physical effects to neglect. There are no internal contradictions. It is a specified modeling problem.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is valid. A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe phase shift $\\chi(u)$ in a TEM for a spatial frequency $u$ is generally given by:\n$$ \\chi(u) = \\pi \\lambda u^2 \\Delta f - \\frac{1}{2} \\pi \\lambda^3 u^4 C_s $$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is the electron wavelength, $\\Delta f$ is the defocus, and $C_s$ is the spherical aberration coefficient.\n\nTemporal coherence loss arises from the energy spread of the electron source. An electron with energy $E = E_0 + \\delta E$ experiences a different defocus due to the chromatic aberration of the objective lens. The problem gives this defocus shift as $\\delta f = C_c \\delta E / E_0$. The total phase shift for such an electron includes this variation:\n$$ \\chi(u, \\delta E) = \\chi_0(u) + \\pi \\lambda u^2 \\delta f = \\chi_0(u) + \\frac{\\pi \\lambda u^2 C_c}{E_0} \\delta E $$\nwhere $\\chi_0(u)$ is the phase shift for an electron with the mean energy $E_0$.\n\nThe observed contrast transfer function (CTF) is an average over the different phase factors $\\exp(-i\\chi(u, \\delta E))$ for all electrons, weighted by the energy probability distribution $P(\\delta E)$. This average results in the product of the ideal CTF, $\\sin(\\chi_0(u))$, and an envelope function, $E_t(u)$, which describes the loss of coherence. The temporal coherence envelope $E_t(u)$ is given by the integral:\n$$ E_t(u) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\exp\\left(-i \\frac{\\pi \\lambda u^2 C_c}{E_0} \\delta E\\right) P(\\delta E) d(\\delta E) $$\nThis integral is the Fourier transform of the energy distribution $P(\\delta E)$. The problem specifies a Gaussian energy distribution with a full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of $\\Delta E$. The probability distribution for the energy deviation $\\delta E$ is:\n$$ P(\\delta E) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma_E \\sqrt{2\\pi}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{(\\delta E)^2}{2\\sigma_E^2}\\right) $$\nThe standard deviation $\\sigma_E$ is related to the FWHM by $\\text{FWHM} = 2\\sqrt{2\\ln 2}\\,\\sigma$. Thus, $\\sigma_E = \\frac{\\Delta E}{2\\sqrt{2\\ln 2}}$.\n\nThe Fourier transform of a Gaussian function is another Gaussian function. For a distribution $N(0, \\sigma_E^2)$, its characteristic function (Fourier transform) is $\\exp(-\\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_E^2 k^2)$. Here, the transform variable is $k = \\frac{\\pi \\lambda u^2 C_c}{E_0}$. The temporal coherence envelope is therefore:\n$$ E_t(u) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\sigma_E^2 \\left(\\frac{\\pi \\lambda u^2 C_c}{E_0}\\right)^2\\right) = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{\\pi \\lambda u^2 C_c \\sigma_E}{E_0}\\right)^2\\right) $$\nWe are asked to find the spatial frequency $u$ at which $E_t(u) = 0.5$.\n$$ 0.5 = \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{\\pi \\lambda u^2 C_c \\sigma_E}{E_0}\\right)^2\\right) $$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides:\n$$ \\ln(0.5) = -\\ln(2) = -\\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{\\pi \\lambda u^2 C_c \\sigma_E}{E_0}\\right)^2 $$\n$$ 2 \\ln 2 = \\left(\\frac{\\pi \\lambda u^2 C_c \\sigma_E}{E_0}\\right)^2 $$\nTaking the square root and solving for $u^2$:\n$$ \\sqrt{2 \\ln 2} = \\frac{\\pi \\lambda u^2 C_c \\sigma_E}{E_0} \\implies u^2 = \\frac{E_0 \\sqrt{2 \\ln 2}}{\\pi \\lambda C_c \\sigma_E} $$\nTo find the numerical value, we must first calculate the constants $\\lambda$ and $\\sigma_E$.\n\nThe constants are:\n- $h = 6.62607 \\times 10^{-34}\\,\\text{J}\\cdot\\text{s}$\n- $e = 1.60218 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{C}$\n- $m_e = 9.10938 \\times 10^{-31}\\,\\text{kg}$\n- $c = 2.99792 \\times 10^8\\,\\text{m/s}$\n- $V_0 = 2 \\times 10^5\\,\\text{V}$\n- $C_c = 1.2 \\times 10^{-3}\\,\\text{m}$\n- $\\Delta E = 0.7\\,\\text{eV} = 0.7 \\times (1.60218 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{J}) = 1.121526 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{J}$\n- $E_0 = e V_0 = (1.60218 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\text{C}) \\times (2 \\times 10^5\\,\\text{V}) = 3.20436 \\times 10^{-14}\\,\\text{J}$\n\nFirst, we calculate the electron wavelength $\\lambda$.

In the linear imaging approximation, the transfer of spatial frequency components of the object exit wave is governed by an aberration phase function whose low-order isotropic form, retaining only defocus and spherical aberration, is given by the well-tested expression $ \\chi(u) = \\pi \\left( \\tfrac{1}{2} C_s \\lambda^{3} u^{4} - \\Delta f \\, \\lambda \\, u^{2} \\right) $, where $u$ is the scalar spatial frequency (the magnitude of the two-dimensional reciprocal-space vector), $C_s$ is the spherical aberration coefficient, $\\Delta f$ is the defocus (with the sign convention that underfocus is $ \\Delta f < 0 $), and $\\lambda$ is the relativistic electron wavelength.

It presents a standard, non-trivial derivation in the theory of high-resolution electron microscopy. All necessary information is provided, and the premises are consistent with established physical principles. The problem is therefore valid and a solution will be provided.\n\nThe core of this problem lies in connecting the phase of a wave in reciprocal (Fourier) space to its apparent position in real space. According to the stationary-phase approximation in Fourier optics, a phase gradient in reciprocal space corresponds to a spatial displacement in real space. The lateral displacement vector, $\\delta\\vec{r}$, for features associated with the spatial frequency vector $\\vec{u}$ is given by the gradient of the aberration phase function $\\chi(\\vec{u})$:\n$$ \\delta\\vec{r}(\\vec{u}) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\nabla_{\\vec{u}} \\chi(\\vec{u}) $$\nThe problem states that the aberration function $\\chi$ is isotropic, meaning it depends only on the magnitude of the spatial frequency vector, $u = |\\vec{u}|$.

In Case A ($C_s > 0, \\Delta f < 0$), the two terms contributing to the gradient, $C_s \\lambda^{3} u^{3}$ and $-\\Delta f \\lambda u$, are both positive and thus add constructively, leading to a large and monotonically increasing delocalization. In Case B ($C_s < 0, \\Delta f < 0$), the terms $C_s \\lambda^{3} u^{3}$ (negative) and $-\\Delta f \\lambda u$ (positive) have opposite signs and can cancel each other. This cancellation, which can make the delocalization zero at a specific frequency $u_0 = \\sqrt{f_0/(C_0\\lambda^2)}$, is the basis of low-delocalization imaging with aberration correctors.\nContrast reversals are governed by the sign of $\\sin(\\chi(u))$. In Case A, $\\chi_A(u) = \\pi (\\frac{1}{2} C_0 \\lambda^3 u^4 + f_0 \\lambda u^2)$ is a rapidly and monotonically increasing function of $u$. It will cross many integer multiples of $\\pi$, causing rapid oscillations in $\\sin(\\chi(u))$ and thus multiple contrast reversals. In Case B, $\\chi_B(u) = \\pi (f_0 \\lambda u^2 - \\frac{1}{2} C_0 \\lambda^3 u^4)$ is not monotonic. By choosing $f_0$ and $C_0$ appropriately, $\\chi_B(u)$ can be made to stay within a narrow range (e.g., between $0$ and $-\\pi$) over a wide band of spatial frequencies.

The formula for $d$ is $d = (N/k)a$. Since uncertainties in $N$ and $k$ are to be ignored, the uncertainty in $d$ arises solely from the uncertainty in $a$. The law of propagation of uncertainty for a single variable states:\n$$\nu_d = \\left| \\frac{\\partial d}{\\partial a} \\right| u_a\n$$\nThe partial derivative is $\\frac{\\partial d}{\\partial a} = \\frac{N}{k}$. Thus:\n$$\nu_d = \\frac{N}{k} u_a = \\frac{d}{a_0} u_a\n$$\nThe total uncertainty in the pixel size, $u_a$, is the combination of two independent (uncorrelated) sources: the calibration uncertainty, $u_{a,\\mathrm{cal}}$, and the defocus-induced uncertainty, $u_{a,\\mathrm{df}}$. These are combined in quadrature:\n$$\nu_a^2 = u_{a,\\mathrm{cal}}^2 + u_{a,\\mathrm{df}}^2\n$$\nWe are given $u_{a,\\mathrm{cal}} = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5}$ nm. We must calculate $u_{a,\\mathrm{df}}$ using the provided formula $u_{a,\\mathrm{df}} = a_0 \\eta u_{\\Delta f}$.\nWith $a_0 = 0.0210$ nm, $\\eta = 5.0 \\times 10^{-5}$ nm$^{-1}$, and $u_{\\Delta f} = 10.0$ nm:\n$$\nu_{a,\\mathrm{df}} = (0.0210) \\times (5.0 \\times 10^{-5}) \\times (10.0) = 1.05 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ nm}\n$$\nNow, calculate the combined uncertainty $u_a$:\n$$\nu_a = \\sqrt{u_{a,\\mathrm{cal}}^2 + u_{a,\\mathrm{df}}^2} = \\sqrt{(5.0 \\times 10^{-5})^2 + (1.05 \\times 10^{-5})^2}\n$$\n$$\nu_a = \\sqrt{25 \\times 10^{-10} + 1.1025 \\times 10^{-10}} = \\sqrt{26.1025 \\times 10^{-10}} \\approx 5.10906 \\times 10^{-5} \\text{ nm}\n$$\nFinally, calculate the desired uncertainty in the lattice spacing, $u_d$:\n$$\nu_d = \\frac{d}{a_0} u_a \\approx \\frac{0.115645}{0.0210} \\times (5.10906 \\times 10^{-5}) \\approx 0.00028134 \\text{ nm}\n$$\nRounding to two significant figures as instructed, we get $u_d = 0.00028$ nm.\n\nThe final reported result is the pair $(d, u_d)$ with the specified rounding.\n$d = 0.1156$ nm.\n$u_d = 0.00028$ nm.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0.1156 & 0.00028\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2490532"}]}
