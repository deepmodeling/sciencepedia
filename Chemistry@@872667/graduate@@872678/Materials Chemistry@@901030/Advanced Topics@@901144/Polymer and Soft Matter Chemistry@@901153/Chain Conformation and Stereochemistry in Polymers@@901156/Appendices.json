No rounding is required, and no units are needed.", "solution": "The problem presented is a standard, well-posed problem in the statistical mechanics of polymers. It is scientifically grounded in the Bernoullian model of stereopolymerization, which is a fundamental concept in materials chemistry. All definitions are precise, and the given information is sufficient and consistent. Therefore, we proceed with the derivation.\n\nThe polymerization process is described as a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials. At each propagation step, a dyad is formed. The dyad can be either meso ($m$) with probability $p_m$ or racemo ($r$) with probability $p_r$.\nThe probability of forming a meso dyad is given as:\n$$ P(m) = p_m $$\nSince there are only two possible outcomes for a dyad configuration, the probability of forming a racemo dyad is:\n$$ P(r) = p_r = 1 - p_m $$\nThe problem stipulates that $0 < p_m < 1$, ensuring neither outcome is impossible nor certain.\n\nFirst, we derive the triad fractions. A triad consists of three successive stereocenters, which are defined by two adjacent dyads. For a long chain where end effects are negligible, the probability of a specific dyad type is independent of the preceding dyad. This is the essence of the Bernoullian model.\n\nThe fraction of $mm$ triads is the probability of observing two consecutive meso dyads. Due to independence, this is:\n$$ P(mm) = P(m, m) = P(m) \\times P(m) = p_m^2 $$\n\nThe fraction of $rr$ triads is the probability of observing two consecutive racemo dyads. This is:\n$$ P(rr) = P(r, r) = P(r) \\times P(r) = (1-p_m)^2 $$\n\nThe heterotactic triad fraction, conventionally denoted $mr$, corresponds to sequences where the two adjacent dyads are different. This includes both the $mr$ sequence (meso followed by racemo) and the $rm$ sequence (racemo followed by meso). The probabilities for these are:\n$$ P(m, r) = P(m) \\times P(r) = p_m (1-p_m) $$\n$$ P(r, m) = P(r) \\times P(m) = (1-p_m) p_m $$\nThe total fraction of heterotactic triads, which we denote as $[mr]$, is the sum of these probabilities:\n$$ [mr] = P(m, r) + P(r, m) = p_m(1-p_m) + (1-p_m)p_m = 2p_m(1-p_m) $$\nWe can verify that these fractions sum to unity, which is the number $1$:\n$$ P(mm) + [mr] + P(rr) = p_m^2 + 2p_m(1-p_m) + (1-p_m)^2 = p_m^2 + 2p_m - 2p_m^2 + 1 - 2p_m + p_m^2 = 1 $$\n\nNext, we derive the mean length of an $m$-run. An $m$-run is defined as a maximal contiguous sequence of meso dyads, meaning it is bounded on both sides by $r$-dyads (or by a chain end, which we ignore). A robust method to find the mean run length is to divide the total number of $m$ dyads in a long chain by the total number of $m$-runs. Let the chain consist of $N$ dyads in total.\n\n1.  **Total number of $m$ dyads**: In a long chain, the number of $m$ dyads is simply its total length times the probability of any given dyad being meso.\n    $$ N_m = N \\times P(m) = N p_m $$\n\n2.  **Total number of $m$-runs**: An $m$-run begins where an $r$ dyad is followed by an $m$ dyad (an $r \\to m$ transition). The number of $m$-runs is therefore equal to the number of such transitions. Since the process is Bernoullian, the probability of this transition is:\n    $$ P(r \\to m) = P(r) \\times P(m) = (1 - p_m) p_m $$\n    The total number of $m$-runs in the chain is:\n    $$ N_{\\text{runs}} = N \\times P(r \\to m) = N(1 - p_m)p_m $$\n\n3.  **Mean $m$-run length**: The mean length, $E[L_m]$, is the ratio of the total number of $m$ dyads to the total number of $m$-runs.\n    $$ E[L_m] = \\frac{N_m}{N_{\\text{runs}}} = \\frac{N p_m}{N(1 - p_m)p_m} = \\frac{1}{1 - p_m} $$\n\nThis expression gives the average number of meso dyads in a maximal contiguous sequence.

The detailed balance condition implies the Metropolis-Hastings acceptance rule:\n$$A(X \\rightarrow X') = \\min\\left(1, \\frac{P(X') g(X' \\rightarrow X)}{P(X) g(X \\rightarrow X)}\\right) = \\min\\left(1, \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta E) \\frac{g(X' \\rightarrow X)}{g(X \\rightarrow X)}\\right)$$\nwhere $\\Delta E = E(X') - E(X)$.\n\nFor the algorithm to be correct, it must also be ergodic (able to reach any relevant state) and respect all model constraints. The measurements must be performed on a properly equilibrated and decorrelated set of samples from the Markov chain.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n**Option A:**\n\n- **Algorithm**: The proposed algorithm involves a single-dihedral move.\n    1. A bond index $i$ is chosen uniformly.\n    2. A new state $\\phi_i'$ is proposed by selecting uniformly from all RIS states consistent with tacticity at position $i$.\n    This proposal mechanism is symmetric. If there are $M_i$ allowed states at position $i$, then the probability of proposing a specific state $\\phi_i'$ from $\\phi_i$ is $1/M_i$. The reverse move, proposing $\\phi_i$ from $\\phi_i'$, also has probability $1/M_i$. Thus, $g(\\{\\dots, \\phi_i, \\dots\\} \\rightarrow \\{\\dots, \\phi_i', \\dots\\}) = g(\\{\\dots, \\phi_i', \\dots\\} \\rightarrow \\{\\dots, \\phi_i, \\dots\\})$.\n- **Acceptance Rule**: For a symmetric proposal, the Metropolis-Hastings acceptance probability simplifies to the Metropolis rule, $A(X \\rightarrow X') = \\min\\{1, \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta E)\\}$. This is exactly what is proposed.\n- **Energy Calculation**: The energy difference $\\Delta E$ is correctly calculated using only the local terms that depend on $\\phi_i$: $\\Delta E = [E_{\\text{tor}}(\\phi_i') - E_{\\text{tor}}(\\phi_i)] + [E_{\\text{nn}}(\\phi_{i-1},\\phi_i') - E_{\\text{nn}}(\\phi_{i-1},\\phi_i)] + [E_{\\text{nn}}(\\phi_i',\\phi_{i+1}) - E_{\\text{nn}}(\\phi_i,\\phi_{i+1})]$. This is computationally efficient and correct.\n- **Constraints**: The proposal respects tacticity constraints by construction. The moves are local and are known to be ergodic for linear polymers. Requirements (i), (ii), and (iii) are satisfied.\n- **Measurement Protocol**: The protocol correctly identifies the need to discard an initial equilibration segment and to handle sample correlation (via stride or block averaging). The estimator for the mean-squared end-to-end distance, $\\langle R^2 \\rangle$, is the sample mean of $|\\mathbf{R}|^2$, which is correct. The estimator for the dihedral probability distribution $P(\\phi)$ is described correctly for both discrete states ($P(s) = n_s / \\sum_s n_s$) and a binned continuous representation, showing a clear understanding of normalization. Requirement (iv) is fully satisfied.\n\n**Verdict**: This option describes a completely correct and standard implementation of a Metropolis MCMC simulation for the given problem. **Correct**.\n\n**Option B:**\n\n- **Algorithm**: This describes an energy minimization scheme, not a sampling algorithm. The proposal is to deterministically choose the state that minimizes the local torsional energy $E_{\\text{tor}}$, which does not constitute a random proposal from a distribution. The acceptance rule is given as \"reject with probability $\\exp(+\\beta \\Delta E)$\" for $\\Delta E > 0$. Since $\\exp(+\\beta \\Delta E) > 1$, this cannot be a probability. This entire scheme violates the principles of MCMC and detailed balance. It will not sample the Boltzmann distribution but will instead get trapped in a local energy minimum.\n- **Measurement Protocol**: The measurement of $\\langle R^2 \\rangle$ as the mean of $|\\mathbf{R}|$ is incorrect; it should be the mean of $|\\mathbf{R}|^2$. The analytical calculation of $P(\\phi)$ from only $E_{\\text{tor}}$ is incorrect because it ignores the crucial pairwise coupling term $E_{\\text{nn}}$ and does not reflect the sampled ensemble.\n- **Verdict**: This option is fundamentally flawed in its algorithm, which is not an MCMC method, and its measurement procedures. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option C:**\n\n- **Algorithm**: This option describes a nonlocal move. The proposal is to draw dihedrals for a segment from the single-bond Boltzmann distribution, $P_{\\text{tor}}(\\phi') \\propto \\exp[-\\beta E_{\\text{tor}}(\\phi')]$. This constitutes a biased, non-symmetric proposal, since the proposal probability $g(X \\to X')$ depends on the energy of the new state $X'$. The reverse proposal probability $g(X' \\to X)$ would depend on the energy of the old state $X$. For such a non-symmetric proposal, the acceptance rule must be the full Metropolis-Hastings form, including the ratio of proposal probabilities. The option suggests using the simple Metropolis rule $A = \\min\\{1, \\exp(-\\beta \\Delta E)\\}$, which is only valid for symmetric proposals. This violates detailed balance.\n- **Measurement Protocol**: The relation $\\langle R^2 \\rangle = 6 \\langle R_g^2 \\rangle$ is an approximation that holds strictly only for ideal, unperturbed Gaussian chains in the long-chain limit. It is not generally valid for the given model, which includes specific stereochemistry and steric interactions ($E_{\\text{nn}}$) that introduce correlations and deviations from ideal behavior. The normalization procedure for $P(\\phi)$ is ambiguously worded (\"normalize... by the number of bonds only\"), suggesting an incorrect understanding of how to construct a probability distribution from sample counts.\n- **Verdict**: The algorithm violates detailed balance, and the measurement protocol relies on an invalid physical approximation. **Incorrect**.\n\n**Option D:**\n\n- **Algorithm**:\n    1. **Selection**: Choosing a bond index $i$ with a probability proportional to $E_{\\text{or}}(\\phi_i)$ is a biased, non-uniform selection. This would require a corresponding correction in the acceptance probability, which is not mentioned.\n    2. **Proposal**: Proposing a new angle $\\phi_i'$ \"uniformly in the continuous range, unconstrained by RIS states or tacticity\" violates two core tenets of the problem: the RIS model itself (which has a discrete set of states) and the requirement to respect stereochemical constraints (ii).\n    3. **Acceptance**: The acceptance rule uses an energy difference $\\Delta E$ that includes only the torsional term, ignoring the neighbor-interaction term $E_{\\text{nn}}$. This means the algorithm would sample from the wrong distribution, one based on an incomplete energy function.\n- **Measurement Protocol**: \"brief warm-up\" is not a rigorous approach to equilibration. Averaging over every step ignores sample correlation, leading to an underestimation of statistical error. Tallying \"accepted proposals only\" is a catastrophic error in MCMC. The state of the chain at each step, regardless of whether a move was accepted or rejected, is a sample from the target distribution. A rejected move means the previous state is sampled again. Excluding these instances severely biases the resulting averages.\n- **Verdict**: This option is riddled with fundamental errors at every stage, from the proposal mechanism and acceptance rule to the measurement protocol. It violates nearly all requirements. **Incorrect**.\n\nIn conclusion, only Option A outlines a scientifically and mathematically sound algorithm and measurement protocol consistent with the principles of statistical mechanics and MCMC simulation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2472256"}]}
