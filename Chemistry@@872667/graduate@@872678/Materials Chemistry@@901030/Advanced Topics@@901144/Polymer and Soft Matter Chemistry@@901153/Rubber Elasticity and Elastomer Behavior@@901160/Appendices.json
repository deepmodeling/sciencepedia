It is often insufficient to capture the full complexity of an elastomer's response across all possible deformation states. Real material behavior is governed by the intricate evolution of the polymer network, which is more complex than this two-parameter model can represent, especially at larger strains.\n\nSecond, different deformation modes exhibit different sensitivities to the model parameters $C_1$ and $C_2$. The derived stress for equibiaxial tension, $\\sigma_1 = 2C_1(\\lambda^2 - \\lambda^{-4}) + 2C_2(\\lambda^4 - \\lambda^{-2})$, shows a strong dependence on $C_2$ through the $\\lambda^4$ term, which grows rapidly with stretch. In contrast, for uniaxial tension ($\\lambda_1 = \\lambda, \\lambda_2 = \\lambda_3 = \\lambda^{-1/2}$), the true stress is $\\sigma_1 = 2C_1(\\lambda^2 - \\lambda^{-1}) + 2C_2(\\lambda - \\lambda^{-2})$. Here, the dependence on $C_2$ is much weaker. A regression analysis performed solely on uniaxial data may yield parameters that accurately fit that specific stress-strain curve but do not correctly represent the material's response in biaxial states where the contribution of the $C_2$ term is significantly amplified. To obtain a more robust and predictive model, it is imperative to calibrate the material parameters using experimental data from multiple deformation modes, such as uniaxial tension, pure shear, and equibiaxial tension, in a simultaneous fitting procedure. This minimizes the error across a wider range of the deformation space and yields a more reliable parameter set.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{2.822}$$", "id": "2518781"}]}
