It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and contains all necessary information for a complete solution. We proceed.\n\nThe problem requires the derivation and calculation of several average molecular weights for a polymer sample with a discrete distribution of molar masses. The sample consists of three species, indexed by $i = 1, 2, 3$. The given data are the molar masses $M_i$ and the corresponding absolute number of molecules $N_i$.\nThe molar masses are given as $M_1 = 10 \\text{ kg mol}^{-1}$, $M_2 = 20 \\text{ kg mol}^{-1}$, and $M_3 = 100 \\text{ kg mol}^{-1}$.\nThe molecule counts are $N_1 = 1000$, $N_2 = 100$, and $N_3 = 10$.\n\nThe general form of an average of a property $X$ over a distribution is given by $\\langle X \\rangle = \\frac{\\sum_i \\alpha_i X_i}{\\sum_i \\alpha_i}$, where $\\alpha_i$ is the weighting factor for the $i$-th species. The different molecular weight averages arise from different choices of this weighting factor.\n\nFirst, we derive the expression for the number-average molecular weight, $M_n$. This average is defined by weighting each molecule equally, regardless of its mass. Therefore, the weighting factor $\\alpha_i$ is simply the number of molecules of species $i$, which is $N_i$. The property being averaged is the molar mass $M_i$. Applying the general formula:\n$$M_n = \\frac{\\sum_i N_i M_i}{\\sum_i N_i}$$\nThis expression matches the definition of an arithmetic mean of the molar mass over all individual molecules in the sample. As requested, we can also express this in terms of the number fraction, $p_i = N_i / \\sum_j N_j$. Dividing the numerator and denominator by $\\sum_j N_j$, we find $M_n = \\sum_i \\left( \\frac{N_i}{\\sum_j N_j} \\right) M_i = \\sum_i p_i M_i$.\n\nSecond, we derive the expression for the weight-average molecular weight, $M_w$. For this average, each molecule is weighted by its mass. The total mass of species $i$ is $N_i M_i$. Thus, the weighting factor $\\alpha_i$ is $N_i M_i$. The property being averaged is again the molar mass $M_i$.\n$$M_w = \\frac{\\sum_i (N_i M_i) M_i}{\\sum_i (N_i M_i)} = \\frac{\\sum_i N_i M_i^2}{\\sum_i N_i M_i}$$\nThis can be expressed using the weight fraction, $w_i = N_i M_i / \\sum_j N_j M_j$. From the derived formula, $M_w = \\sum_i \\left( \\frac{N_i M_i}{\\sum_j N_j M_j} \\right) M_i = \\sum_i w_i M_i$.\n\nThird, we derive the expression for the z-average molecular weight, $M_z$. This average is obtained from techniques like sedimentation equilibrium in an ultracentrifuge and represents a higher-order moment of the distribution. For the z-average, the weighting factor $\\alpha_i$ corresponds to the second moment of the mass distribution, $N_i M_i^2$.\n$$M_z = \\frac{\\sum_i (N_i M_i^2) M_i}{\\sum_i (N_i M_i^2)} = \\frac{\\sum_i N_i M_i^3}{\\sum_i N_i M_i^2}$$\n\nNow, we compute the numerical values for the given sample. We must first evaluate the necessary sums, which represent the moments of the number distribution.\nThe zeroth moment, total number of molecules:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{3} N_i = N_1 + N_2 + N_3 = 1000 + 100 + 10 = 1110$$\nThe first moment, proportional to total mass:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{3} N_i M_i = (1000)(10) + (100)(20) + (10)(100) = 10000 + 2000 + 1000 = 13000 \\text{ kg mol}^{-1}$$\nThe second moment:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{3} N_i M_i^2 = (1000)(10^2) + (100)(20^2) + (10)(100^2) = 100000 + 40000 + 100000 = 240000 \\text{ (kg mol}^{-1})^2$$\nThe third moment:\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^{3} N_i M_i^3 = (1000)(10^3) + (100)(20^3) + (10)(100^3) = 1000000 + 800000 + 10000000 = 11800000 \\text{ (kg mol}^{-1})^3$$\n\nUsing these sums and the derived formulae, we calculate the averages:\n$$M_n = \\frac{\\sum_i N_i M_i}{\\sum_i N_i} = \\frac{13000}{1110} \\approx 11.7117 \\text{ kg mol}^{-1}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $M_n = 11.71 \\text{ kg mol}^{-1}$.\n\n$$M_w = \\frac{\\sum_i N_i M_i^2}{\\sum_i N_i M_i} = \\frac{240000}{13000} \\approx 18.4615 \\text{ kg mol}^{-1}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $M_w = 18.46 \\text{ kg mol}^{-1}$.\n\n$$M_z = \\frac{\\sum_i N_i M_i^3}{\\sum_i N_i M_i^2} = \\frac{11800000}{240000} \\approx 49.1667 \\text{ kg mol}^{-1}$$\nRounding to four significant figures, $M_z = 49.17 \\text{ kg mol}^{-1}$.\n\nFor any polydisperse sample, it is a mathematical certainty that $M_z \\ge M_w \\ge M_n$, with equality holding only for a monodisperse sample. Our results $49.17 > 18.46 > 11.71$ are consistent with this principle.\n\nFinally, we discuss the relative sensitivity of these averages to a high-mass tail. The derived expressions show that the averages are ratios of successive moments of the number distribution: $M_n = \\mu_1 / \\mu_0$, $M_w = \\mu_2 / \\mu_1$, and $M_z = \\mu_3 / \\mu_2$, where $\\mu_k = \\sum_i N_i M_i^k$. The key difference between them is the power of $M_i$ used in the weighting.\nFor $M_n$, the contribution of each species is proportional to $N_i M_i$. Because the high-mass species ($M_3 = 100$) is numerically rare ($N_3=10$), its contribution to the numerator $\\sum N_i M_i$ is small. $M_n$ is dominated by the most numerous species ($N_1=1000$), and its value ($11.71$) is very close to the mass of that species ($10$).\nFor $M_w$, the weighting involves $M_i^2$. A high mass $M_i$ is squared, which strongly amplifies its contribution. The contribution of species $3$ to the numerator $\\sum N_i M_i^2$ is $10 \\times 100^2 = 100000$, which is a substantial fraction ($100000/240000 \\approx 41.7\\%$) of the total sum, despite this species comprising less than $1\\%$ of the molecules ($10/1110 \\approx 0.9\\%$ by number). Consequently, $M_w$ is significantly larger than $M_n$.\nFor $M_z$, the weighting involves $M_i^3$. This cubic dependence makes $M_z$ exceptionally sensitive to the high-mass tail. The contribution of species $3$ to the numerator $\\sum N_i M_i^3$ is $10 \\times 100^3 = 10000000$. This single term dominates the sum, accounting for $10000000/11800000 \\approx 84.7\\%$ of the total. This extreme weighting pulls $M_z$ to a much higher value ($49.17$) that is heavily skewed towards the mass of the heaviest fraction.\nIn summary, the sensitivity to high-mass components increases with the order of the average: $M_n  M_w  M_z$. $M_n$ is sensitive to number, while $M_w$ and $M_z$ are progressively more sensitive to the mass of the largest molecules in the distribution.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 11.71  18.46  49.17 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2513304"}, {"introduction": "While calculating averages from a known discrete distribution is a crucial first step, the real-world challenge lies in determining these values from experimental data.

It presents a standard problem in polymer characterization using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) data. I will proceed with the solution.\n\nThe fundamental definitions for number-average molecular weight ($M_n$) and weight-average molecular weight ($M_w$) for a polydisperse polymer sample consisting of a discrete set of populations are given by:\n$$ M_n = \\frac{\\sum_i N_i M_i}{\\sum_i N_i} $$\n$$ M_w = \\frac{\\sum_i w_i M_i}{\\sum_i w_i} $$\nwhere for each population $i$, $N_i$ is the number of moles of polymer chains, $M_i$ is the molar mass of those chains, and $w_i$ is the total mass of the chains, given by $w_i = N_i M_i$.\n\nIn size-exclusion chromatography, the chromatogram is discretized into slices, each corresponding to a specific elution volume $V_{e,i}$ and, consequently, a specific molecular weight $M_i$. The detector signal is related to the amount of polymer eluting in each slice.\n\nTo solve this problem from first principles, we must make two critical assumptions based on established physical properties relevant to the experimental setup:\n1.  The differential refractive index (DRI) detector response is linear with the mass concentration of the polymer. The problem statement itself refers to the \"physically established proportionality of refractive index detector response to mass concentration for dilute polymer solutions.\"\n2.  The specific refractive index increment, $\\frac{dn}{dc}$, is constant and independent of the polymer molecular weight. This is a standard and generally valid assumption for a homopolymer.\n\nUnder these assumptions, the integrated detector signal for a given slice $i$, denoted as $S_i$, is directly proportional to the total mass, $w_i$, of the polymer eluting in that slice. We can write this relationship as $w_i = k S_i$, where $k$ is a proportionality constant that depends on the detector sensitivity and the specific refractive index increment. Since this constant appears in both the numerator and denominator of the expressions for $M_n$ and $M_w$, it will cancel out and does not need to be known.\n\nThe number of moles of polymer in slice $i$, $N_i$, is the mass of the polymer in that slice divided by its molecular weight:\n$$ N_i = \\frac{w_i}{M_i} = \\frac{k S_i}{M_i} $$\n\nNow, we substitute these expressions for $N_i$ and $w_i$ into the fundamental definitions of $M_n$ and $M_w$.\n\nFor the weight-average molecular weight, $M_w$:\n$$ M_w = \\frac{\\sum_i w_i M_i}{\\sum_i w_i} = \\frac{\\sum_i (k S_i) M_i}{\\sum_i k S_i} = \\frac{k \\sum_i S_i M_i}{k \\sum_i S_i} = \\frac{\\sum_i S_i M_i}{\\sum_i S_i} $$\n\nFor the number-average molecular weight, $M_n$:\n$$ M_n = \\frac{\\sum_i N_i M_i}{\\sum_i N_i} = \\frac{\\sum_i (\\frac{k S_i}{M_i}) M_i}{\\sum_i \\frac{k S_i}{M_i}} = \\frac{k \\sum_i S_i}{k \\sum_i \\frac{S_i}{M_i}} = \\frac{\\sum_i S_i}{\\sum_i \\frac{S_i}{M_i}} $$\n\nThe molecular weight $M_i$ for each slice is determined from the SEC calibration curve using the elution volume $V_{e,i}$ for that slice.

The givens are $w_{1} = 0.6$ at $M_{1} = 100$ kDa and $w_{2} = 0.4$ at $M_{2} = 200$ kDa.\n$$ M_{n,0} = \\left( \\frac{0.6}{100} + \\frac{0.4}{200} \\right)^{-1} = \\left( 0.006 + 0.002 \\right)^{-1} = (0.008)^{-1} = 125 \\text{ kDa} $$\n$$ M_{w,0} = (0.6)(100) + (0.4)(200) = 60 + 80 = 140 \\text{ kDa} $$\nFor the higher averages, we compute the necessary sums:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{2} w_{i} M_{i}^{2} = (0.6)(100)^{2} + (0.4)(200)^{2} = 6000 + 16000 = 22000 \\text{ kDa}^2 $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{2} w_{i} M_{i}^{3} = (0.6)(100)^{3} + (0.4)(200)^{3} = 6 \\times 10^5 + 3.2 \\times 10^6 = 3.8 \\times 10^6 \\text{ kDa}^3 $$\nUsing these sums:\n$$ M_{z,0} = \\frac{22000}{140} = \\frac{1100}{7} \\approx 157.14 \\text{ kDa} $$\n$$ M_{z+1,0} = \\frac{3.8 \\times 10^6}{22000} = \\frac{1900}{11} \\approx 172.73 \\text{ kDa} $$\n\nNext, we formulate the expressions for the final three-component mixture. The weight fractions are $w'_{1} = 0.999 \\times 0.6 = 0.5994$, $w'_{2} = 0.999 \\times 0.4 = 0.3996$, and $w_{\\mathrm{H}} = 0.001$. Let $M_{\\mathrm{H}}$ be the unknown molar mass of the third component. The sums required for the final averages (denoted with subscript $f$) are:\n$$ \\sum_{i=1,2,H} \\frac{w'_{i}}{M_{i}} = 0.999 \\left(\\frac{w_{1}}{M_{1}} + \\frac{w_{2}}{M_{2}}\\right) + \\frac{w_{\\mathrm{H}}}{M_{\\mathrm{H}}} = 0.999(0.008) + \\frac{0.001}{M_{\\mathrm{H}}} = 0.007992 + \\frac{0.001}{M_{\\mathrm{H}}} $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1,2,H} w'_{i} M_{i} = 0.999 \\left(w_{1}M_{1} + w_{2}M_{2}\\right) + w_{\\mathrm{H}}M_{\\mathrm{H}} = 0.999(140) + 0.001 M_{\\mathrm{H}} = 139.86 + 0.001 M_{\\mathrm{H}} $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1,2,H} w'_{i} M_{i}^{2} = 0.999 \\left(w_{1}M_{1}^{2} + w_{2}M_{2}^{2}\\right) + w_{\\mathrm{H}}M_{\\mathrm{H}}^{2} = 0.999(22000) + 0.001 M_{\\mathrm{H}}^{2} = 21978 + 0.001 M_{\\mathrm{H}}^{2} $$\n$$ \\sum_{i=1,2,H} w'_{i} M_{i}^{3} = 0.999 \\left(w_{1}M_{1}^{3} + w_{2}M_{2}^{3}\\right) + w_{\\mathrm{H}}M_{\\mathrm{H}}^{3} = 0.999(3.8 \\times 10^{6}) + 0.001 M_{\\mathrm{H}}^{3} = 3796200 + 0.001 M_{\\mathrm{H}}^{3} $$\nThe final averages in terms of $M_{\\mathrm{H}}$ are:\n$$ M_{n,f} = \\left( 0.007992 + \\frac{0.001}{M_{\\mathrm{H}}} \\right)^{-1} $$\n$$ M_{w,f} = 139.86 + 0.001 M_{\\mathrm{H}} $$\n$$ M_{z,f} = \\frac{21978 + 0.001 M_{\\mathrm{H}}^{2}}{139.86 + 0.001 M_{\\mathrm{H}}} $$\n$$ M_{z+1,f} = \\frac{3796200 + 0.001 M_{\\mathrm{H}}^{3}}{21978 + 0.001 M_{\\mathrm{H}}^{2}} $$\n\nThe problem requires finding $M_{\\mathrm{H}}$ such that $M_{z,f} = 2 M_{z,0}$. Using the previously calculated value $M_{z,0} = \\frac{1100}{7}$, the condition is $M_{z,f} = \\frac{2200}{7}$.\n$$ \\frac{21978 + 0.001 M_{\\mathrm{H}}^{2}}{139.86 + 0.001 M_{\\mathrm{H}}} = \\frac{2200}{7} $$\nCross-multiplication gives:\n$$ 7(21978 + 0.001 M_{\\mathrm{H}}^{2}) = 2200(139.86 + 0.001 M_{\\mathrm{H}}) $$\n$$ 153846 + 0.007 M_{\\mathrm{H}}^{2} = 307692 + 2.2 M_{\\mathrm{H}} $$\nRearranging into a standard quadratic equation $a x^{2} + b x + c = 0$:\n$$ 0.007 M_{\\mathrm{H}}^{2} - 2.2 M_{\\mathrm{H}} - 153846 = 0 $$\nSolving for $M_{\\mathrm{H}}$ using the quadratic formula, and taking the physically meaningful positive root:\n$$ M_{\\mathrm{H}} = \\frac{-(-2.2) + \\sqrt{(-2.2)^{2} - 4(0.007)(-153846)}}{2(0.007)} $$\n$$ M_{\\mathrm{H}} = \\frac{2.2 + \\sqrt{4.84 + 4307.688}}{0.014} = \\frac{2.2 + \\sqrt{4312.528}}{0.014} \\approx \\frac{2.2 + 65.670}{0.014} \\approx 4847.857 \\text{ kDa} $$\nRounding to four significant figures as required, we obtain $M_{\\mathrm{H}} = 4848$ kDa. The phrase \"while $M_{n}$ changes as little as possible\" is a didactic comment on the differential sensitivity of the averages, not an optimization constraint, as the value of $M_{\\mathrm{H}}$ is uniquely determined.\n\nUsing $M_{\\mathrm{H}} = 4848$ kDa, we evaluate the final averages and comment quantitatively on their change relative to the initial values.\n$$ M_{n,f} = \\left( 0.007992 + \\frac{0.001}{4848} \\right)^{-1} \\approx (0.007992206)^{-1} \\approx 125.12 \\text{ kDa} $$\nThe relative change in $M_{n}$ is $\\frac{125.12 - 125}{125} \\approx +0.098\\%$. This is a negligible increase.\n$$ M_{w,f} = 139.86 + 0.001(4848) = 139.86 + 4.848 = 144.708 \\text{ kDa} $$\nThe relative change in $M_{w}$ is $\\frac{144.708 - 140}{140} \\approx +3.36\\%$. This is a modest increase.\n$$ M_{z,f} = \\frac{21978 + 0.001(4848)^{2}}{144.708} = \\frac{21978 + 23503.1}{144.708} \\approx 314.30 \\text{ kDa} $$\nThe relative change in $M_{z}$ is $\\frac{314.30 - 157.14}{157.14} \\approx +100\\%$. As designed, $M_z$ has doubled.\n$$ M_{z+1,f} = \\frac{3796200 + 0.001(4848)^{3}}{21978 + 0.001(4848)^{2}} \\approx \\frac{3.796 \\times 10^6 + 1.139 \\times 10^8}{45481.1} \\approx 2588 \\text{ kDa} $$\nThe relative change in $M_{z+1}$ is $\\frac{2588 - 172.73}{172.73} \\approx +1398\\%$. The $z{+}1$-average has increased by a factor of approximately $15$, demonstrating extreme sensitivity to the high-molar-mass tail. This analysis confirms that higher-order averages are disproportionately affected by a small weight fraction of a high-molar-mass component.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4848}$$", "id": "2513337"}]}
