A complete solution will be provided.\n\nThe solution is developed in three parts as requested by the problem statement.\n\n**1. Definition of Mineralization Percentage**\nMineralization refers to the complete oxidation of organic matter to its inorganic constituents. In the context of an organic polymer containing carbon, hydrogen, and other elements, aerobic mineralization converts the organic carbon to carbon dioxide. The extent of this conversion is quantified as the mineralization fraction or percentage.\n\nLet $m_{\\text{TOC}}$ be the total mass of organic carbon initially present in the polymer specimen. Let $m_{\\text{C, converted}}$ be the mass of this organic carbon that has been converted to carbon dioxide, $\\mathrm{CO}_2$, over the course of the experiment.\n\nThe mineralization fraction, which we denote as $D$, is the ratio of the mass of converted carbon to the total initial mass of organic carbon:\n$$ D = \\frac{m_{\\text{C, converted}}}{m_{\\text{TOC}}} $$\nThe mineralization percentage, $\\%D$, is this fraction expressed as a percentage:\n$$ \\%D = \\frac{m_{\\text{C, converted}}}{m_{\\text{TOC}}} \\times 100\\% $$\nThis definition quantifies the fraction of the polymer's carbon that has been returned to the inorganic carbon cycle.\n\n**2. Derivation of the Analytical Expression**\nTo derive an analytical expression for the mineralization fraction $D$, we must express both $m_{\\text{TOC}}$ and $m_{\\text{C, converted}}$ in terms of the measurable quantities provided.\n\nFirst, we determine the total mass of organic carbon, $m_{\\text{TOC}}$, in the initial polymer specimen. This is the product of the specimen's mass, $m_{\\text{poly}}$, and the carbon mass fraction in the polymer, $w_{\\text{C}}$:\n$$ m_{\\text{TOC}} = m_{\\text{poly}} \\times w_{\\text{C}} $$\n\nNext, we determine the mass of carbon converted to carbon dioxide, $m_{\\text{C, converted}}$. The carbon dioxide evolved from the test reactor, $m_{\\mathrm{CO_2, test}}$, originates from two sources: the biodegradation of the polymer and the endogenous respiration of the microbial inoculum. The blank reactor, containing only the inoculum, measures the carbon dioxide produced solely by endogenous respiration, $m_{\\mathrm{CO_2, blank}}$. Therefore, the net mass of carbon dioxide produced from the mineralization of the polymer, $m_{\\mathrm{CO_2, net}}$, is the difference between the test and blank reactor measurements:\n$$ m_{\\mathrm{CO_2, net}} = m_{\\mathrm{CO_2, test}} - m_{\\mathrm{CO_2, blank}} $$\nTo find the mass of carbon, $m_{\\text{C, converted}}$, corresponding to this mass of carbon dioxide, we use the law of conservation of mass. The mass fraction of carbon in carbon dioxide is the ratio of the molar mass of carbon, $M_{\\text{C}}$, to the molar mass of carbon dioxide, $M_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}$. Thus:\n$$ m_{\\text{C, converted}} = m_{\\mathrm{CO_2, net}} \\times \\frac{M_{\\mathrm{C}}}{M_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}} = (m_{\\mathrm{CO_2, test}} - m_{\\mathrm{CO_2, blank}}) \\frac{M_{\\mathrm{C}}}{M_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}} $$\nThis step is equivalent to a stoichiometric calculation: converting the mass of $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ to moles, using the $1:1$ mole ratio of $\\mathrm{C}$ to $\\mathrm{CO}_2$ to find moles of $\\mathrm{C}$, and then converting moles of $\\mathrm{C}$ back to mass.\n\nFinally, we substitute the expressions for $m_{\\text{TOC}}$ and $m_{\\text{C, converted}}$ into the definition of the mineralization fraction $D$:\n$$ D = \\frac{(m_{\\mathrm{CO_2, test}} - m_{\\mathrm{CO_2, blank}}) \\frac{M_{\\mathrm{C}}}{M_{\\mathrm{CO_2}}}}{m_{\\text{poly}} \\times w_{\\text{C}}} $$\nThis is the required analytical expression for the mineralization fraction in terms of the given experimental parameters.\n\n**3. Computation of the Mineralization Fraction**\nWe now substitute the provided numerical values into the derived expression. It is imperative to maintain consistent units. We will convert all masses to grams (g).\n$m_{\\text{poly}} = 2.500\\,\\mathrm{g}$\n$w_{\\text{C}} = 0.5000$ (dimensionless)\n$m_{\\mathrm{CO_2, test}} = 1985.3\\,\\mathrm{mg} = 1.9853\\,\\mathrm{g}$\n$m_{\\mathrm{CO_2, blank}} = 120.5\\,\\mathrm{mg} = 0.1205\\,\\mathrm{g}$\n$M_{\\text{C}} = 12.011\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$\n$M_{\\mathrm{CO_2}} = 44.0095\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$\n\nFirst, calculate the denominator, which is the total organic carbon, $m_{\\text{TOC}}$:\n$$ m_{\\text{TOC}} = m_{\\text{poly}} \\times w_{\\text{C}} = 2.500\\,\\mathrm{g} \\times 0.5000 = 1.250\\,\\mathrm{g} $$\nNext, calculate the numerator, which is the mass of carbon converted, $m_{\\text{C, converted}}$:\n$$ m_{\\text{C, converted}} = (1.9853\\,\\mathrm{g} - 0.1205\\,\\mathrm{g}) \\times \\frac{12.011\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}}{44.0095\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}} $$\n$$ m_{\\text{C, converted}} = (1.8648\\,\\mathrm{g}) \\times \\frac{12.011}{44.0095} $$\nNow, we compute the fraction $D$:\n$$ D = \\frac{1.8648 \\times 12.011}{1.250 \\times 44.0095} $$\n$$ D = \\frac{22.4000328}{55.011875} \\approx 0.4071863... $$\nThe inputs with the fewest significant figures are $m_{\\text{poly}}$ ($4$ significant figures) and $w_{\\text{C}}$ ($4$ significant figures).

The data provided are physically realistic for a plasticized polylactide system. The problem is well-posed, providing all necessary information and clear, non-contradictory assumptions to guide the derivation of a unique solution. The language is objective and precise.

The observed melting endotherm, $\\Delta H_{m}$, represents the energy required to melt all crystals present at the melting temperature. Some of these crystals may have formed during the heating scan itself, an exothermic process known as cold crystallization, with associated enthalpy change $\\Delta H_{cc}$. To find the enthalpy corresponding only to the crystals present in the specimen *before* the heating scan began, one must subtract the heat released during cold crystallization from the total heat absorbed during melting.\n\nThe net enthalpy of fusion for the crystals initially present in the specimen, per unit mass of the total specimen, is:\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\text{net, specimen}} = \\Delta H_{m} - \\Delta H_{cc} $$\nSubstituting the given values:\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\text{net, specimen}} = 41.9\\,\\mathrm{J\\,g^{-1}} - 5.2\\,\\mathrm{J\\,g^{-1}} = 36.7\\,\\mathrm{J\\,g^{-1}} $$\nThis enthalpy value is reported per gram of the total specimen, which includes the inert plasticizer. However, the degree of crystallinity is an intrinsic property of the polymer phase. Therefore, this enthalpy must be normalized to the mass of the polymer (PLA) in the specimen. The mass fraction of PLA is given as $w_{\\mathrm{PLA}} = 0.90$. The enthalpy per gram of PLA is thus:\n$$ \\Delta H_{\\text{net, PLA}} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{net, specimen}}}{w_{\\mathrm{PLA}}} $$\nThe degree of crystallinity, $X_{c}$, is then computed by comparing this value to the reference enthalpy of fusion for $100\\,\\%$ crystalline PLA, $\\Delta H_{f}^{0}$:\n$$ X_{c} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{\\text{net, PLA}}}{\\Delta H_{f}^{0}} = \\frac{\\Delta H_{m} - \\Delta H_{cc}}{w_{\\mathrm{PLA}} \\cdot \\Delta H_{f}^{0}} $$\nSubstituting all numerical values into this expression:\n$$ X_{c} = \\frac{41.9 - 5.2}{0.90 \\times 93} = \\frac{36.7}{83.7} \\approx 0.43847 $$\n\nPart 2: Derivation and Evaluation of the Effective Hydrolysis Rate Constant, $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$\n\nThe problem specifies a two-phase model for the PLA component, consisting of a crystalline phase and an amorphous phase. The following assumptions govern the hydrolysis kinetics:\n-   The crystalline phase is inert ($k_{\\mathrm{crys}} = 0$).\n-   The amorphous phase hydrolyzes with an intrinsic pseudo-first-order rate constant $k_{0}$.\n-   The plasticizer is also inert.\n-   The density of hydrolysable ester bonds per unit mass of PLA is constant regardless of phase.\n\nLet $N_{E}$ be the total number of ester bonds in the specimen. Since the plasticizer is inert, all these bonds reside within the PLA component. The pseudo-first-order kinetics dictates that the rate of hydrolysis is proportional to the number of available bonds. The effective rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, describes the overall rate of hydrolysis with respect to the total population of ester bonds:\n$$ \\text{Rate} = -\\frac{dN_{E}}{dt} = k_{\\mathrm{eff}} N_{E} $$\nHowever, the reaction only occurs in the amorphous phase. Let $N_{E,a}$ be the number of ester bonds in the amorphous fraction of the PLA. The total rate is physically determined by the reaction in this phase:\n$$ \\text{Rate} = k_{0} N_{E,a} $$\nThe number of bonds in the amorphous fraction, $N_{E,a}$, can be related to the total number of bonds, $N_{E}$, through the degree of crystallinity, $X_{c}$. Since ester bond density per unit mass of PLA is uniform, the number of bonds is proportional to the mass of the respective phase. The mass fraction of the amorphous phase within the PLA component is $(1 - X_{c})$. Therefore:\n$$ N_{E,a} = (1 - X_{c}) N_{E} $$\nSubstituting this into the physical rate equation:\n$$ \\text{Rate} = k_{0} (1 - X_{c}) N_{E} $$\nBy equating the two expressions for the total rate, we obtain the relationship between the effective and intrinsic rate constants:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{eff}} N_{E} = k_{0} (1 - X_{c}) N_{E} $$\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{eff}} = k_{0} (1 - X_{c}) $$\nThis result is physically justified: the effective rate constant for the entire polymer is the intrinsic rate constant of the reactive phase ($k_0$) scaled by the fraction of the polymer that is in that reactive, amorphous state, which is $(1 - X_{c})$.\n\nFinally, we evaluate $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ numerically using the value of $X_{c}$ computed in Part 1 and the given $k_{0}$.\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 0.080\\,\\mathrm{h^{-1}} \\times (1 - 0.43847) $$\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{eff}} = 0.080\\,\\mathrm{h^{-1}} \\times 0.56153 $$\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx 0.0449224\\,\\mathrm{h^{-1}} $$\nRounding the result to three significant figures as required by the problem statement gives:\n$$ k_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\approx 0.0449\\,\\mathrm{h^{-1}} $$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.0449}$$", "id": "2470751"}, {"introduction": "For a biodegradable polymer to be useful in an application, it must maintain its mechanical integrity for a specified service life before degrading.
