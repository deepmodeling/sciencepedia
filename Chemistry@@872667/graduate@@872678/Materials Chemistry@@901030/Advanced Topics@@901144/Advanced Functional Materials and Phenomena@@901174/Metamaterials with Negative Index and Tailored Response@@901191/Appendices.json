It is a well-posed problem in classical electromagnetism concerning the characterization of a homogeneous material slab from scattering data. The problem is scientifically grounded, objective, and contains sufficient information for a unique solution up to predictable branch ambiguities, the discussion of which is part of the task.\n\nWe begin by modeling the physical system. A homogeneous, isotropic slab of thickness $d$ is situated in the region $0 \\le z \\le d$, surrounded by vacuum ($z  0$ and $z  d$). The slab is characterized by an effective complex refractive index $n_{\\text{eff}}$ and a normalized impedance $z_{\\text{eff}} = Z_{\\text{eff}}/Z_0$, where $Z_0 = \\sqrt{\\mu_0/\\epsilon_0}$ is the impedance of free space. A monochromatic plane wave with time dependence $\\exp(-i\\omega t)$ is normally incident from $z  0$. The electric and magnetic fields, polarized along the $x$ and $y$ axes respectively, can be written in the three regions:\n\nRegion 1 ($z0$, vacuum):\n$$E_x(z) = E_i \\exp(i k_0 z) + E_r \\exp(-i k_0 z)$$\n$$H_y(z) = \\frac{1}{Z_0} \\left[ E_i \\exp(i k_0 z) - E_r \\exp(-i k_0 z) \\right]$$\n\nRegion 2 ($0 \\le z \\le d$, metamaterial):\n$$E_x(z) = A \\exp(i n_{\\text{eff}} k_0 z) + B \\exp(-i n_{\\text{eff}} k_0 z)$$\n$$H_y(z) = \\frac{1}{Z_{\\text{eff}}} \\left[ A \\exp(i n_{\\text{eff}} k_0 z) - B \\exp(-i n_{\\text{eff}} k_0 z) \\right]$$\n\nRegion 3 ($zd$, vacuum):\n$$E_x(z) = E_t \\exp(i k_0 (z-d))$$\n$$H_y(z) = \\frac{1}{Z_0} E_t \\exp(i k_0 (z-d))$$\n\nHere, $k_0 = \\omega/c$ is the free-space wavenumber. The complex reflection and transmission coefficients, $r$ and $t$, are defined by normalizing the amplitudes of the reflected and transmitted waves to the incident wave amplitude at the respective interfaces. We set the incident amplitude $E_i = 1$. This implies $E_r = r$ and $E_t = t$.\n\nThe boundary conditions require the continuity of tangential electric and magnetic fields at the interfaces $z=0$ and $z=d$.\n\nAt the interface $z=0$:\nContinuity of $E_x$:\n$$1 + r = A + B \\quad (1)$$\nContinuity of $H_y$:\n$$\\frac{1}{Z_0} (1 - r) = \\frac{1}{Z_{\\text{eff}}} (A - B) \\implies 1 - r = \\frac{1}{z_{\\text{eff}}}(A - B) \\quad (2)$$\n\nAt the interface $z=d$:\nLet $X = \\exp(i n_{\\text{eff}} k_0 d)$ be the complex propagation factor through the slab.\nContinuity of $E_x$:\n$$A X + B X^{-1} = t \\quad (3)$$\nContinuity of $H_y$:\n$$\\frac{1}{Z_{\\text{eff}}} (A X - B X^{-1}) = \\frac{t}{Z_0} \\implies A X - B X^{-1} = z_{\\text{eff}} t \\quad (4)$$\n\nWe have a system of four equations and must solve for $n_{\\text{eff}}$ and $z_{\\text{eff}}$ in terms of $r$ and $t$.

This path is algebraically intensive.\nA more direct method is to add and subtract equations that result from rearranging (I) and (II):\nFrom (I): $t(X^{-1}+z_{\\text{eff}}X^{-1}) = 1+r+z_{\\text{eff}}-z_{\\text{eff}}r$\nFrom (II): $t(X-z_{\\text{eff}}X) = 1+r-z_{\\text{eff}}+z_{\\text{eff}}r$\nThis is also not straightforward.\n\nLet us return to equations (I) and (II) and divide one by the other:\n$$\\frac{t(1-z_{\\text{eff}})X}{t(1+z_{\\text{eff}})X^{-1}} = \\frac{1+r-z_{\\text{eff}}(1-r)}{1+r+z_{\\text{eff}}(1-r)}$$\n$$\\frac{1-z_{\\text{eff}}}{1+z_{\\text{eff}}}X^2 = \\frac{1+r-z_{\\text{eff}}(1-r)}{1+r+z_{\\text{eff}}(1-r)}$$\nThis is a quadratic equation for $z_{\\text{eff}}$ involving $X^2$, which does not simplify the problem.\n\nLet us try another combination of the four initial boundary condition equations. Summing equations (1) and (2) gives $2 = A(1+1/z_{\\text{eff}})+B(1-1/z_{\\text{eff}})$. Summing (3) and (4) gives $t(1+1/z_{\\text{eff}}) = 2AX$. This is equally complex.\n\nThe cleanest path is to construct expressions for $X+X^{-1}$ and $X-X^{-1}$.\nFrom (I) and (II), we may write:\n$X^{-1} = \\frac{1}{t}(\\frac{1+r}{1+z_{\\text{eff}}} + z_{\\text{eff}}\\frac{1-r}{1+z_{\\text{eff}}})$\n$X = \\frac{1}{t}(\\frac{1+r}{1-z_{\\text{eff}}} - z_{\\text{eff}}\\frac{1-r}{1-z_{\\text{eff}}})$\nSumming these expressions is not simple.\n\nLet us try to eliminate $z_{\\text{eff}}$ from equations (I) and (II) by rewriting them as\n$z_{\\text{eff}}[tX^{-1} - (1-r)] = (1+r) - tX^{-1}$ and $z_{\\text{eff}}[tX + (1-r)] = tX - (1+r)$. This is incorrect.\nCorrect manipulation:\n$t+tz_{\\text{eff}}=X(1+r)+z_{\\text{eff}}X(1-r) \\implies z_{\\text{eff}}[t-X(1-r)] = X(1+r)-t$\n$t-tz_{\\text{eff}}=X^{-1}(1+r)-z_{\\text{eff}}X^{-1}(1-r) \\implies z_{\\text{eff}}[-t+X^{-1}(1-r)] = X^{-1}(1+r)-t$\nThis leads to a very complicated expression.\n\nThere is a more elegant derivation. Consider the sum and difference of the two main relations from the transfer matrix method, which are equivalent to our system:\n$1+r = t (\\cos(n_{\\text{eff}} k_0 d) + i z_{\\text{eff}} \\sin(n_{\\text{eff}} k_0 d))$\n$1-r = t (\\cos(n_{\\text{eff}} k_0 d) + i \\frac{1}{z_{\\text{eff}}} \\sin(n_{\\text{eff}} k_0 d))$\nDividing gives $\\frac{1+r}{1-r} = \\frac{\\cos(n_{\\text{eff}} k_0 d) + i z_{\\text{eff}} \\sin(n_{\\text{eff}} k_0 d)}{\\cos(n_{\\text{eff}} k_0 d) + i (1/z_{\\text{eff}}) \\sin(n_{\\text{eff}} k_0 d)}$. This can be solved for $z_{\\text{eff}}$. Re-substituting would give $n_{\\text{eff}}$.\n\nThe cleanest algebraic route from (I) and (II) is to form the sum $X+X^{-1}$.\nFrom (I): $X = \\frac{t(1+z_{\\text{eff}})}{1+r+z_{\\text{eff}}(1-r)}$. From (II): $X^{-1} = \\frac{t(1-z_{\\text{eff}})}{1+r-z_{\\text{eff}}(1-r)}$.\n$X+X^{-1} = \\frac{t(1+z_{\\text{eff}})}{1+r+z_{\\text{eff}}(1-r)} + \\frac{1+r-z_{\\text{eff}}(1-r)}{t(1-z_{\\text{eff}})}$. This approach is unnecessarily complex.\n\nLet us return to the result $z_{\\text{eff}}^2[(1-r)^2 - t^2] = (1+r)^2 - t^2$.\nLet's find an expression for $X$ that is independent of $z_{\\text{eff}}$.\nLet $t = S_{21}$ and $r = S_{11}$. We derived $z_{\\text{eff}}^2 = \\frac{(1+S_{11})^2 - S_{21}^2}{(1-S_{11})^2 - S_{21}^2}$.\nFrom the boundary conditions, one can also derive $S_{21} = t$ and $S_{11} = r$ as:\n$S_{21} = X \\frac{1-z_{\\text{eff}}^{-2}}{2\\cos(nk_0d) - 2i(z_{\\text{eff}}+z_{\\text{eff}}^{-1})\\sin(nk_0d)}$\nThis is becoming a circular derivation. The simplest path is correct:\n$2\\cos(n_{\\text{eff}}k_0 d) = X+X^{-1}$. From (I) and (II), we can solve for $X$ and $X^{-1}$ and add them.\n$X = \\frac{1+r-z_{\\text{eff}}(1-r)}{t(1-z_{\\text{eff}})}$ and $X^{-1} = \\frac{1+r+z_{\\text{eff}}(1-r)}{t(1+z_{\\text{eff}})}$\n$X+X^{-1} = \\frac{1}{t}\\left[\\frac{1+r-z(1-r)}{1-z} + \\frac{1+r+z(1-r)}{1+z}\\right]$\n$ = \\frac{1}{t(1-z^2)}\\left[(1+z)(1+r-z(1-r)) + (1-z)(1+r+z(1-r))\\right]$\nNumerator: $(1+r-z(1-r) + z(1+r)-z^2(1-r)) + (1+r+z(1-r)-z(1+r)-z^2(1-r))$\n$= 2(1+r) - 2z^2(1-r) = 2(1+r-z^2+z^2r)$\n$X+X^{-1} = \\frac{2(1+r-z^2+z^2r)}{t(1-z^2)}$\nSubstitute $z^2 = \\frac{(1+r)^2 - t^2}{(1-r)^2 - t^2}$. This is excessively complicated.\n\nLet us restart the algebra concisely.\n$2t = (A+B)(X+X^{-1}) + (A-B)(X-X^{-1})$.\n$2r = (A+B)(X+X^{-1}) - (A-B)(X-X^{-1}) - 2B(X+X^{-1})$. No.\nLet's take the equations for $t$ and $r$ derived via transfer matrix:\n$2t\\cos(n_{\\text{eff}}k_0 d) = (1-r) + (1+r) = 2$. No, this assumes $z=1$.\n$t^{-1}(1+r) = \\cos(nk_0d) + iz\\sin(nk_0d)$\n$t^{-1}(1-r) = \\cos(nk_0d) + i z^{-1}\\sin(nk_0d)$\nSubtracting: $t^{-1}(2r) = i(z-z^{-1})\\sin(nk_0d)$.\nAdding: $t^{-1}(2) = 2\\cos(nk_0d) + i(z+z^{-1})\\sin(nk_0d)$.\nFrom this system, after much algebra, one finds $\\cos(n_{\\text{eff}} k_0 d) = \\frac{1-r^2+t^2}{2t}$.\nThis result is standard and its derivation from first principles, while algebraically tedious, is valid. We proceed with this known intermediate result.\nFrom this equation, we can write:\n$n_{\\text{eff}} k_0 d = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{1-r^2+t^2}{2t}\\right)$\nThis inversion introduces ambiguities. The final expressions are:\n1. $z_{\\text{eff}} = \\pm \\sqrt{\\frac{(1+r)^2 - t^2}{(1-r)^2 - t^2}}$\n2. $n_{\\text{eff}} = \\frac{1}{k_0 d} \\left[ \\pm \\arccos\\left(\\frac{1-r^2+t^2}{2t}\\right) + 2m\\pi \\right]$, for $m \\in \\mathbb{Z}$\n\n**Discussion of Ambiguities and Branch Selection:**\n\nThe derived expressions have multiple branches, requiring physical criteria for selection.\n\n1.  **Impedance ambiguity ($z_{\\text{eff}}$):** The square root yields a $\\pm$ sign ambiguity. For any passive medium, the time-averaged power flow must be in the direction of wave propagation. This requires the real part of the wave impedance to be non-negative. Therefore, the physical branch is the one that satisfies $\\text{Re}(z_{\\text{eff}}) \\ge 0$.\n\n2.  **Refractive index ambiguity ($n_{\\text{eff}}$):** This ambiguity arises from two sources in the inversion of the cosine function.\n    a. **Sign ambiguity ($\\pm \\arccos$):** The arccosine function is even, $\\cos(\\theta) = \\cos(-\\theta)$. This corresponds to the two solutions for the propagation factor $X=\\exp(i n_{\\text{eff}} k_0 d)$ being reciprocals. For a passive medium, wave amplitude cannot grow during propagation. With an $\\exp(-i\\omega t)$ time convention, the refractive index must have a non-negative imaginary part, $\\text{Im}(n_{\\text{eff}}) \\ge 0$. This condition dictates the choice of sign. The condition $\\text{Im}(n_{\\text{eff}}) \\ge 0$ is equivalent to requiring that the magnitude of the propagation factor be less than or equal to one, $|X| = |\\exp(i n_{\\text{eff}} k_0 d)| = \\exp(-\\text{Im}(n_{\\text{eff}}) k_0 d) \\le 1$. One must select the sign in $\\pm \\arccos$ that leads to this condition.\n    b. **Integer ambiguity ($2m\\pi$):** The phase of a wave is only known modulo $2\\pi$. The $\\arccos$ function returns a principal value of the phase, typically in $[0, \\pi]$. This corresponds to assuming the slab is thinner than half a wavelength. The integer $m$ accounts for thicker slabs where the total phase accumulation is larger. This ambiguity cannot be resolved from a single-frequency measurement. Resolution requires additional information, such as assuming the sample is electrically thin ($m=0$), or performing measurements over a frequency range and enforcing continuity and causality on $n_{\\text{eff}}(\\omega)$ to unwrap the phase.\n\n**Consistency and Negative Index:**\nThe material parameters are related via $n_{\\text{eff}} = \\sqrt{\\epsilon_r \\mu_r}$ and $z_{\\text{eff}} = \\sqrt{\\mu_r/\\epsilon_r}$, where $\\epsilon_r$ and $\\mu_r$ are the relative permittivity and permeability. Passivity requires $\\text{Im}(\\epsilon_r) \\ge 0$ and $\\text{Im}(\\mu_r) \\ge 0$. These imply conditions on the retrieved $n_{\\text{eff}}$ and $z_{\\text{eff}}$: $\\text{Im}(n_{\\text{eff}} z_{\\text{eff}}) \\ge 0$ and $\\text{Im}(n_{\\text{eff}}/z_{\\text{eff}}) \\ge 0$.\nThe possibility of a negative real part of the refractive index, $\\text{Re}(n_{\\text{eff}})  0$, is a key feature of certain metamaterials. This condition defines a left-handed medium. A negative $\\text{Re}(n_{\\text{eff}})$ does not violate passivity. The branch selection rules, $\\text{Re}(z_{\\text{eff}}) \\ge 0$ and $\\text{Im}(n_{\\text{eff}}) \\ge 0$, remain the fundamental physical constraints. The sign of $\\text{Re}(n_{\\text{eff}})$ is determined by the complex value of the argument of the $\\arccos$ function.\nThe retrieval process is to first calculate the two possible values for $z_{\\text{eff}}$ and select the one with non-negative real part. Then, calculate $n_{\\text{eff}}$ for $m=0$ using both $\\pm$ branches of the arccosine. The correct branch is the one yielding $\\text{Im}(n_{\\text{eff}}) \\ge 0$.

It describes a physically relevant situation in the characterization of metamaterials. We shall proceed directly to the solution.\n\nFirst, we address the two preliminary arguments required by the problem.\n\n1.  **Derivation of the Transmitted Field Form:**\n    Maxwell’s equations are linear. Consequently, any solution for the electromagnetic field within the metamaterial slab ($0 \\le z \\le L$) can be expressed as a linear superposition of the eigenmodes of the structure. For a medium periodic along the $z$-axis, these eigenmodes are the Bloch modes. According to Bloch's theorem, a mode $p$ is of the form $\\mathbf{F}_p(z) = \\mathbf{u}_p(z) \\exp(i \\beta_p z)$, where $\\mathbf{u}_p(z)$ is a periodic function with the same period $a$ as the medium, and $\\beta_p$ is the complex Bloch wavenumber.\n\n    For a plane wave at normal incidence, only Bloch modes with zero transverse wavevector components are excited. The total field inside the slab is a superposition of these forward- and backward-propagating axial modes. The problem states that multiple internal reflections are negligible. This is a crucial simplification which allows us to neglect the amplitudes of backward-propagating modes that arise from reflection at the $z=L$ interface. Thus, the forward-propagating field inside the slab can be written as:\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{E}_{\\text{slab}}(z) = \\sum_{p=1}^{P} A_p \\mathbf{u}_p(z) e^{i \\beta_p z}, \\quad 0 \\le z \\le L\n    $$\n    where $P$ is the number of forward-propagating modes supported at the frequency $\\omega$. The complex amplitudes $A_p$ are determined by the boundary conditions at the input interface $z=0$, which dictate how the incident plane wave couples into each Bloch mode.\n\n    At the output interface $z=L$, this field is transmitted into the surrounding medium. The transmitted field is a plane wave, $\\mathbf{E}_{\\text{trans}}$. Due to the linearity of Maxwell's equations and the associated boundary conditions, the amplitude of the transmitted wave is a linear superposition of the contributions from each Bloch mode arriving at the interface:\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{E}_{\\text{trans}}(z=L) \\propto \\sum_{p=1}^{P} A_p \\mathbf{u}_p(L) e^{i \\beta_p L}\n    $$\n    The complex transmission coefficient, $T(L)$, is defined as the ratio of the complex amplitude of the transmitted field to that of the incident field. Consolidating all coupling efficiencies (at both $z=0$ and $z=L$) and normalization factors into a set of complex coefficients $C_p$, we arrive at the required form:\n    $$\n    T(L) = \\sum_{p=1}^{P} C_{p} \\, e^{i \\beta_{p} L}\n    $$\n\n2.  **Inconsistency of Single-Mode Effective-Medium Retrieval:**\n    A single-mode effective-medium model posits that the slab is equivalent to a homogeneous slab of thickness $L$ characterized by a single effective axial wavenumber $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ (and effective impedance $z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$). Under the problem's assumption of negligible multiple reflections, the transmission coefficient for such a model would have a simple exponential dependence on thickness: $T_{\\text{eff}}(L) \\propto e^{i k_{\\mathrm{eff}} L}$.\n\n    If one attempts to extract an effective wavenumber from the measured transmission coefficient $T(L)$ of the actual multimode slab, for example by inverting the simplified relation $T(L) = e^{i k_{\\mathrm{eff}} L}$, one obtains:\n    $$\n    k_{\\mathrm{eff}}(L) = - \\frac{i}{L} \\ln T(L) = - \\frac{i}{L} \\ln\\left(\\sum_{p=1}^{P} C_{p} \\, e^{i \\beta_{p} L}\\right)\n    $$\n    (where we ignore the branch ambiguity of the logarithm for this part of the argument). If $P \\ge 2$ and at least two modes with distinct wavenumbers ($\\beta_p \\neq \\beta_q$) have non-zero excitation coefficients ($C_p, C_q \\neq 0$), the sum of exponentials cannot be represented as a single exponential function whose phase is linear in $L$. The resulting retrieved parameter $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}(L)$ will exhibit a non-trivial dependence on thickness $L$. However, an effective material parameter must, by its very definition, be an intrinsic property of the medium and thus independent of the dimensions of the sample tested. This manifest dependence of $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ on $L$ demonstrates that the single-mode effective-medium model is, in general, inconsistent and fails to describe the physics of multimode propagation.\n\nNow, we evaluate the proposed procedures for detecting such failures.\n\n**A. Perform retrieval for at least $2$ different thicknesses $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$, compute a candidate $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}(L) = -\\dfrac{i}{L} \\ln T(L)$ at each thickness with allowance for the integer $2 \\pi$ phase branch, and then choose branch integers to test whether $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}(L_{1}) = k_{\\mathrm{eff}}(L_{2})$ can be made equal. If no consistent branch selection yields thickness-invariant $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$, conclude multimode contamination; additionally, among branch candidates, select the one minimizing the variance of $\\dfrac{\\partial}{\\partial L} \\arg T(L)$ across multiple $L$ as the physically consistent single-mode solution when it exists.**\nThis procedure is based on the fundamental requirement that a true effective parameter must be independent of sample thickness. A transmission-only retrieval using $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}(L) = \\frac{1}{L} \\left( \\arg(T(L)) + 2\\pi m - i \\ln|T(L)| \\right)$ is a common first approach. Checking for consistency, i.e., $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}(L_1) = k_{\\mathrm{eff}}(L_2)$, across different thicknesses $L_1, L_2$ after resolving the $2\\pi m$ phase ambiguity is a direct test of the validity of the single-mode model. If no integer pair $(m_1, m_2)$ yields equality, the model has failed, strongly indicating multimode propagation. The additional criterion, minimizing the variance of $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial L} \\arg T(L)$, is also physically sound. For a true single mode $p$, $T(L) \\approx C_p e^{i \\beta_p L}$, which means $\\arg T(L) \\approx \\arg C_p + \\beta_p' L$. Its derivative with respect to $L$ is $\\beta_p'$, a constant. For multiple modes, this derivative oscillates with $L$. Minimizing its variance is a logical way to identify the most dominant, single-mode-like behavior. This is a valid and reliable method.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. If $a \\ll \\lambda$, then higher-order Bloch modes cannot be excited and single-mode retrieval is always valid; therefore any thickness dependence of the retrieved $k_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ must be due to measurement error.**\nThis statement is patently false. The condition $a \\ll \\lambda$ is a necessary condition for homogenization, as it ensures that no higher-order diffraction modes are radiated into the surrounding free space (the so-called Floquet-Bloch modes). However, it says nothing definitive about the number of propagating Bloch modes *inside* the metamaterial. A unit cell with a complex internal structure, such as one containing multiple coupled resonators, can support several distinct electromagnetic field configurations, leading to multiple internal Bloch modes even in the deep subwavelength limit ($a \\ll \\lambda$). The problem itself is premised on this physical reality. Attributing all thickness dependence to measurement error on this basis is a severe misjudgment.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Retrieve both the effective refractive index $n$ and the effective impedance $z$ from $R(L)$ and $T(L)$ for at least $2$ thicknesses $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$, and require that both $n$ and $z$ be invariant with $L$. Use this invariance simultaneously with passivity constraints (with $\\exp(-i \\omega t}$ convention, $\\mathrm{Im}\\{n\\} \\ge 0$ and $\\mathrm{Re}\\{z\\} \\ge 0$ for a passive medium) to reject spurious arccosine branch choices. If no pair of branches yields a common $(n,z)$ across $L_{1}$ and $L_{2}$, conclude multimode contamination.**\nThis describes a standard, robust procedure for metamaterial characterization. It is superior to the transmission-only method in option A because it uses more experimental information (both reflection $R(L)$ and transmission $T(L)$) to determine the two fundamental effective parameters of a homogeneous slab: its refractive index $n_{\\mathrm{eff}}$ and impedance $z_{\\mathrm{eff}}$. The validity of the effective medium model then rests on the simultaneous thickness-invariance of *both* retrieved parameters. If multiple modes are present, the functional dependence of $R(L)$ and $T(L)$ on $L$ will deviate from the single-mode homogeneous slab model, and it will be impossible to find a single pair $(n_{\\mathrm{eff}}, z_{\\mathrm{eff}})$ that is consistent across different thicknesses $L_1$ and $L_2$ for any choice of phase branch. The use of passivity constraints is a critical step in correctly resolving branch ambiguities inherent in inverting the trigonometric or exponential functions in the retrieval equations. This method is a cornerstone of reliable parameter extraction.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**D. Apply Kramers–Kronig (KK) relations on a narrowband $n(\\omega)$ retrieved from a single thickness $L$; if the KK consistency appears acceptable over that band, then multimode contamination is excluded.**\nThis procedure is fundamentally flawed. The Kramers-Kronig relations are non-local in frequency; they relate the real part of a response function at a frequency $\\omega$ to an integral of its imaginary part over *all* frequencies from $0$ to $\\infty$. Attempting to test for KK consistency using only narrowband data is impossible and nonsensical. Furthermore, even with broadband data, causality (which KK relations test) is not the primary property that is violated by a multimode-contaminated effective index. The retrieved $n_{\\mathrm{eff}}(\\omega)$, while unphysical in its thickness dependence, is derived from causal S-parameters and is likely to be causal itself. Therefore, KK relations are not the appropriate tool for detecting multimode artifacts, especially not in a narrow band.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. Map the transmitted phase at two lateral positions $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ across the output face at normal incidence; if the phase gradient is uniform in $x$, then only a single axial mode is present and single-mode retrieval is valid.**\nThis procedure is irrelevant to the problem at hand. The problem specifies a normally incident plane wave on a slab that is assumed to be transversely uniform. Due to the translational symmetry of the system in the transverse ($x,y$) plane, the transmitted field must also be a plane wave with no dependence on $x$ or $y$. This is true regardless of whether one or multiple *axial* Bloch modes (modes propagating along $z$) are excited inside the slab. The total transmitted field is a superposition of fields which all possess the same transverse symmetry as the incident field. Consequently, the phase of the transmitted field will be perfectly uniform across the output face. This measurement would provide zero information about the number of axial modes propagating through the slab. Such a measurement is useful for detecting oblique propagation or higher-order diffraction, but not for distinguishing multiple axial modes at normal incidence.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AC}$$", "id": "2500369"}, {"introduction": "The properties of a metamaterial are ultimately dictated by the collective response of its microscopic constituents.

The problem is objective and free of ambiguity.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be derived.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three stages: first, we determine the probability distribution for the total resonance frequency detuning; second, we compute the ensemble-averaged effective susceptibility; and third, we evaluate the real part of the effective permittivity at the specified probe frequency.\n\nThe total detuning of the resonance frequency, $\\delta$, is the sum of two independent random variables, $\\delta = \\delta_s + \\delta_d$. Both $\\delta_s$ and $\\delta_d$ are described by Cauchy (Lorentzian) probability density functions centered at zero. A fundamental property of the Cauchy distribution is its stability under convolution. The sum of two independent, zero-centered Cauchy-distributed random variables is another zero-centered Cauchy-distributed random variable, whose half-width at half-maximum (HWHM) is the sum of the individual HWHMs.\nTherefore, the probability density function for the total detuning $\\delta$ is:\n$$\ng(\\delta) = \\frac{1}{\\pi} \\frac{\\Gamma}{\\delta^{2} + \\Gamma^{2}}\n$$\nwhere the total inhomogeneous broadening width $\\Gamma$ is given by:\n$$\n\\Gamma = \\Gamma_s + \\Gamma_d\n$$\nThe effective susceptibility $\\chi_{\\text{eff}}(\\omega)$ is the ensemble average of the single-particle susceptibility $\\chi(\\omega; \\omega_0)$ over the distribution of resonance frequencies $\\omega_0$.
