This exercise provides a first-principles approach to quantifying these constrictions using a simple but powerful hard-sphere model, connecting the microscopic crystal structure directly to the potential for high ionic mobility. By deriving and calculating the bottleneck radius for a common coordination environment, you will develop a foundational understanding of how lattice geometry governs fast ion transport [@problem_id:2526667].", "problem": "Consider ion migration in a rigid anion framework modeled by the hard-sphere approximation.

Then, a numerical value for $r_{\\mathrm{b}}$ must be computed for a specific oxide system.\n\nThe derivation proceeds from first principles of geometry and steric exclusion. We consider a migrating cation of radius $r$ and three static anions of radius $R_{\\mathrm{A}}$. The centers of the three anions form an equilateral triangle in a plane, with side length $s$. The bottleneck radius, $r_{\\mathrm{b}}$, is defined as the maximum radius of a cation that can pass through the aperture formed by these three anions without any geometric overlap.\n\nThe point of maximum constriction along the migration path through this window lies at the geometric center of the equilateral triangle. Let us denote the anion centers as vertices $A$, $B$, and $C$, and the center of the triangle as $O$. A cation attempting to pass through the window will experience the most severe steric hindrance when its center is at $O$. Therefore, the bottleneck radius $r_{\\mathrm{b}}$ corresponds to the radius of a sphere centered at $O$ that is simultaneously tangent to the three spherical anions centered at $A$, $B$, and $C$.\n\nThe distance from the center $O$ to any vertex of an equilateral triangle (the circumradius of the triangle) must be calculated. Let this distance be $d_{OA}$. In an equilateral triangle with side length $s$, the height $h$ is given by $h = s \\sin(60^\\circ) = s \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$. The centroid $O$ is located at a distance of $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the height from any vertex, measured along the median. Thus, the distance from the center $O$ to any of the anion centers (say, $A$) is:\n$$ d_{OA} = \\frac{2}{3} h = \\frac{2}{3} \\left( s \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right) = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}} $$\n\nAccording to the hard-sphere model, two spheres are tangent when the distance between their centers is equal to the sum of their radii. The cation, with the bottleneck radius $r_{\\mathrm{b}}$, is centered at $O$ and is tangent to the anion of radius $R_{\\mathrm{A}}$ centered at $A$. The condition for tangency is therefore:\n$$ d_{OA} = r_{\\mathrm{b}} + R_{\\mathrm{A}} $$\n\nBy substituting the geometric expression for $d_{OA}$ into the tangency condition, we obtain:\n$$ \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}} = r_{\\mathrm{b}} + R_{\\mathrm{A}} $$\n\nSolving for the bottleneck radius $r_{\\mathrm{b}}$ yields the required analytical expression:\n$$ r_{\\mathrm{b}} = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}} - R_{\\mathrm{A}} $$\nThis expression is derived strictly from geometric first principles, as required.\n\nThe second part of the problem is to compute the numerical value of $r_{\\mathrm{b}}$ for an oxide framework with the given parameters:\n- Anion radius: $R_{\\mathrm{A}} = 1.40$ Å\n- Anion-anion edge length: $s = 2.90$ Å\n\nSubstituting these values into the derived formula:\n$$ r_{\\mathrm{b}} = \\frac{2.90}{\\sqrt{3}} - 1.40 $$\nAll quantities are in units of ångströms (Å), so the result for $r_{\\mathrm{b}}$ will also be in ångströms.\n\nWe perform the calculation:\n$$ r_{\\mathrm{b}} \\approx \\frac{2.90}{1.73205} - 1.40 $$\n$$ r_{\\mathrm{b}} \\approx 1.67431 - 1.40 $$\n$$ r_{\\mathrm{b}} \\approx 0.27431 \\text{ Å} $$\n\nThe problem requires the final answer to be rounded to three significant figures.

The frequency is given by $f_{\\text{max}} = \\omega_{\\text{max}} / (2\\pi)$. Thus, the capacitance can be determined from the resistance and the peak frequency:\n$$C = \\frac{1}{\\omega_{\\text{max}} R} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi f_{\\text{max}} R}$$\nFor the bulk process (first semicircle):\n$$C_{\\text{b}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi f_{1} R_{\\text{b}}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi (1.5915 \\times 10^{6}\\ \\text{Hz}) (100\\ \\Omega)}$$\nThe product $2\\pi (1.5915 \\times 10^{6}) (100) \\approx 9.9997 \\times 10^8$. Within the precision of the given data, we can consider this to be $10^9$.\n$$C_{\\text{b}} = \\frac{1}{10^9\\ \\text{F}^{-1}} = 1.000 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{F}$$\nCalculating precisely: $C_{\\text{b}} = \\frac{1}{9.999742 \\times 10^8} \\approx 1.0000257 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{F}$.\n\nFor the grain boundary process (second semicircle):\n$$C_{\\text{gb}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi f_{2} R_{\\text{gb}}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi (132.6\\ \\text{Hz}) (1200\\ \\Omega)}$$\nThe product $2\\pi (132.6) (1200) \\approx 999776$. This is approximately $10^6$.\n$$C_{\\text{gb}} = \\frac{1}{10^6\\ \\text{F}^{-1}} = 1.000 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{F}$$\nCalculating precisely: $C_{\\text{gb}} = \\frac{1}{999776.16} \\approx 1.0002238 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{F}$.\n\nAt very low frequencies, the impedance of the sample capacitances $C_{\\text{b}}$ and $C_{\\text{gb}}$ becomes extremely high, and they act as open circuits. The total impedance is then dominated by the series combination of the resistances and the double-layer capacitance at the electrode.\n$$Z_{\\text{total}}(\\text{low } f) \\approx R_s + R_{\\text{b}} + R_{\\text{gb}} + \\frac{1}{j\\omega C_{\\text{dl}}}$$\nThe real part is $Z^{\\prime} \\approx R_s + R_{\\text{b}} + R_{\\text{gb}} = 1420\\ \\Omega$, which is consistent with the problem statement. The imaginary part is $Z^{\\prime\\prime} = -\\frac{1}{\\omega C_{\\text{dl}}}$.\nThe magnitude of the imaginary part is given as $\\lvert Z^{\\prime\\prime} \\rvert = 1.5915 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\Omega$ at $f = 1.000\\ \\text{Hz}$.\n$$\\lvert Z^{\\prime\\prime} \\rvert = \\frac{1}{\\omega C_{\\text{dl}}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi f C_{\\text{dl}}}$$\nWe can now solve for the double-layer capacitance $C_{\\text{dl}}$:\n$$C_{\\text{dl}} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi f \\lvert Z^{\\prime\\prime} \\rvert} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi (1.000\\ \\text{Hz}) (1.5915 \\times 10^{4}\\ \\Omega)}$$\nThe product $2\\pi (1.000) (1.5915 \\times 10^4) \\approx 99997.4$. This is approximately $10^5$.\n$$C_{\\text{dl}} = \\frac{1}{10^5\\ \\text{F}^{-1}} = 1.000 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{F}$$\nCalculating precisely: $C_{\\text{dl}} = \\frac{1}{99997.42} \\approx 1.0000257 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{F}$.\n\nThe results must be reported to four significant figures.\n$R_{\\text{b}} = 100\\ \\Omega \\rightarrow 1.000 \\times 10^{2}\\ \\Omega$\n$C_{\\text{b}} = 1.0000257 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{F} \\rightarrow 1.000 \\times 10^{-9}\\ \\text{F}$\n$R_{\\text{gb}} = 1200\\ \\Omega \\rightarrow 1.200 \\times 10^{3}\\ \\Omega$\n$C_{\\text{gb}} = 1.0002238 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{F} \\rightarrow 1.000 \\times 10^{-6}\\ \\text{F}$\n$C_{\\text{dl}} = 1.0000257 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{F} \\rightarrow 1.000 \\times 10^{-5}\\ \\text{F}$\n\nThe vector of results $(R_{\\mathrm{b}}, C_{\\mathrm{b}}, R_{\\mathrm{gb}}, C_{\\mathrm{gb}}, C_{\\mathrm{dl}})$ is assembled.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1.000 \\times 10^{2} & 1.000 \\times 10^{-9} & 1.200 \\times 10^{3} & 1.000 \\times 10^{-6} & 1.000 \\times 10^{-5}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2526660"}]}
