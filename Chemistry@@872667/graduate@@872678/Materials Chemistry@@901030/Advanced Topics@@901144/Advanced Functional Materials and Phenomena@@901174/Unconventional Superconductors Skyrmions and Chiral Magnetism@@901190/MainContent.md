## Introduction
The realms of [unconventional superconductivity](@entry_id:141315) and [chiral magnetism](@entry_id:142604) represent two of the most dynamic frontiers in modern condensed matter physics. These fields explore exotic states of matter where quantum mechanics and electronic interactions conspire to produce emergent phenomena with no classical analogues, from frictionless electron flow to topologically protected, particle-like magnetic whirls. The significance of these topics extends beyond fundamental curiosity, holding immense promise for transformative technologies in [low-power electronics](@entry_id:172295), high-density data storage, and [quantum computation](@entry_id:142712). However, navigating this landscape requires a deep understanding of the subtle interplay between crystal symmetry, [spin-orbit coupling](@entry_id:143520), and strong electronic correlations. This article aims to provide a coherent framework for understanding these complex phenomena, bridging the gap between abstract theoretical constructs and their tangible experimental consequences.

To achieve this, the discussion is structured into three progressive chapters. The first, **Principles and Mechanisms**, delves into the foundational physics, exploring the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction as the origin of [chiral magnetism](@entry_id:142604), the topological nature of [skyrmions](@entry_id:141088), and the symmetry principles governing unconventional Cooper pairing. Building on this foundation, the second chapter, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, shifts focus to the experimental realm. It illustrates how theoretical predictions are tested using advanced characterization techniques and how phenomena like the Topological Hall Effect and Majorana zero modes connect these topics to spintronics and [quantum information science](@entry_id:150091). Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** section provides an opportunity to apply these concepts through targeted problems, reinforcing the theoretical understanding of [skyrmion](@entry_id:140037) stability and the fragility of exotic superconducting states. Together, these chapters offer a comprehensive journey into the physics of chiral magnets and [unconventional superconductors](@entry_id:141195).

## Principles and Mechanisms

This chapter delves into the fundamental principles and microscopic mechanisms that govern the exotic phenomena of [chiral magnetism](@entry_id:142604) and [unconventional superconductivity](@entry_id:141315). We will explore how specific crystal symmetries, in conjunction with spin-orbit coupling, give rise to chiral magnetic interactions. Subsequently, we will examine the resulting complex [magnetic textures](@entry_id:751636), such as helices and [skyrmions](@entry_id:141088), and introduce the concept of [topological protection](@entry_id:145388). The chapter will then transition to the domain of [unconventional superconductivity](@entry_id:141315), elucidating how pairing mechanisms beyond the standard electron-phonon model lead to complex superconducting gap structures with non-trivial momentum dependence. Finally, we will investigate the rich phenomenology that arises from the interplay and competition between these distinct, yet often related, ordered states.

### Chiral Magnetism and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction

Conventional magnetism is often characterized by collinear spin arrangements, such as the parallel alignment in ferromagnets or the anti-parallel alignment in [antiferromagnets](@entry_id:139286). Chiral magnetism represents a departure from this paradigm, describing systems where the ground state exhibits a definite rotational sense, or **handedness**. The primary mechanism responsible for this behavior is an [antisymmetric exchange](@entry_id:138329) coupling known as the **Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI)**.

#### Symmetry Origins of the DMI

The DMI arises from the interplay between the symmetric Heisenberg [exchange interaction](@entry_id:140006) and relativistic spin-orbit coupling in a crystal environment that lacks a [center of inversion](@entry_id:273028). The DMI Hamiltonian for two interacting spins, $\mathbf{S}_1$ and $\mathbf{S}_2$, takes the form:

$$
H_{\text{DM}} = \mathbf{D} \cdot (\mathbf{S}_1 \times \mathbf{S}_2)
$$

The vector $\mathbf{D}$ is the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya vector, whose magnitude and orientation are dictated by the [crystal symmetry](@entry_id:138731). This interaction energetically favors a perpendicular, or canted, arrangement of the two spins, with the sense of canting determined by the direction of $\mathbf{D}$.

The fundamental symmetry requirement for the existence of a non-zero DMI is the absence of **[inversion symmetry](@entry_id:269948)** at the midpoint of the bond connecting the two magnetic ions. If an [inversion center](@entry_id:141957) exists, the operation maps $\mathbf{S}_1 \to \mathbf{S}_2$, $\mathbf{S}_2 \to \mathbf{S}_1$, and $\mathbf{D} \to -\mathbf{D}$. Since the Hamiltonian must be invariant, this would require $\mathbf{D} = -\mathbf{D}$, implying $\mathbf{D}=\mathbf{0}$. Therefore, only noncentrosymmetric [crystal structures](@entry_id:151229) can host a bulk DMI.

A prominent class of materials exhibiting bulk DMI are the cubic B20 compounds, such as manganese silicide (MnSi). These materials crystallize in the noncentrosymmetric [space group](@entry_id:140010) $P2_{1}3$, which belongs to the chiral point group $23$. This point group lacks both inversion and mirror symmetries. In such a system, the long-wavelength free energy density can contain a term that is linear in the spatial gradient of the magnetization, $\mathbf{m}(\mathbf{r})$, known as a **Lifshitz invariant**. For the cubic symmetry of B20 compounds, this term takes the form:

$$
f_{\text{DMI}} = D \mathbf{m} \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf{m})
$$

This term is a [pseudoscalar](@entry_id:196696); it is invariant under proper rotations but changes sign under spatial inversion. Since the crystal's [point group](@entry_id:145002) $23$ does not include inversion, this term is allowed by symmetry and leads to a spontaneous twisting of the magnetization [@problem_id:2534511].

The direction of the DMI vector can be determined more specifically by considering the local geometry of the [superexchange](@entry_id:142159) pathway, as codified by **Moriya's rules**. For a bent M-L-M (metal-ligand-metal) bond where the ligand provides the dominant spin-orbit coupling, the DMI vector is approximately given by $\mathbf{D} \propto \mathbf{r}_{1L} \times \mathbf{r}_{2L}$, where $\mathbf{r}_{iL}$ is the vector from metal site $i$ to the ligand. The sign of the proportionality depends on the details of the orbital overlaps. For instance, in a common scenario where [superexchange](@entry_id:142159) involves interference between a $\sigma$-type and a $\pi$-type hopping path ($t_{pd\sigma}$ and $t_{pd\pi}$), the sign of the DMI component is proportional to the product $\lambda_L t_{pd\sigma} t_{pd\pi}$, where $\lambda_L$ is the ligand's spin-orbit coupling constant. A specified geometry and set of orbital overlaps can thus uniquely determine the direction and sense of the local DMI vector [@problem_id:2534466].

#### Energetics and Formation of Chiral Textures

In a chiral magnet, the ground state magnetic texture is determined by the competition between several energy scales:
1.  **Heisenberg Exchange:** This term, typically of the form $A(\nabla \mathbf{m})^2$ in a continuum model, is symmetric and favors uniform magnetization ($q=0$).
2.  **Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction:** This term, linear in spatial gradients (e.g., $D \mathbf{m} \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf{m})$), is chiral and favors a modulated state with a finite [wavevector](@entry_id:178620), $|q| \propto D/A$.
3.  **Magnetic Anisotropy:** This term, such as uniaxial anisotropy $K(1-m_z^2)$, favors aligning the magnetization along specific crystal axes.

The competition between symmetric exchange and DMI leads to the formation of long-period helical or cycloidal spin spirals. The pitch of this helix, $P$, is related to the magnitude of the modulation wavevector, $q$, by $P = 2\pi/|q|$. This [wavevector](@entry_id:178620) can be directly measured in [neutron scattering](@entry_id:142835) experiments. For MnSi, a measured [wavevector](@entry_id:178620) magnitude of $|q| = 0.036 \, \text{\AA}^{-1}$ corresponds to a [helical pitch](@entry_id:188083) of $P \approx 17.5 \, \text{nm}$ [@problem_id:2534511].

A particularly insightful scenario arises in a thin film with [perpendicular magnetic anisotropy](@entry_id:146658), where the DMI can destabilize a simple ferromagnetic state. Consider a 1D model of a [domain wall](@entry_id:156559) separating regions of up and down magnetization. The energy per unit area of this wall, $\sigma$, is a sum of contributions from exchange stiffness $A$, anisotropy $K$, and DMI constant $D$. Minimizing the energy shows that the wall energy is approximately $\sigma = 4\sqrt{AK} - \pi |D|$. When the DMI strength $|D|$ is small, the wall has positive energy. However, there exists a critical DMI strength, $D_c = \frac{4}{\pi}\sqrt{AK}$, at which the [domain wall energy](@entry_id:146989) first vanishes. For $|D| > D_c$, the wall energy becomes negative, signaling that the uniform ferromagnetic state is unstable towards the spontaneous formation of a modulated state, such as a cycloidal spiral or a stripe domain phase [@problem_id:2534474]. This ratio $\kappa = D/D_c$ is a crucial dimensionless parameter governing the stability of various [chiral textures](@entry_id:136960).

#### Topological Textures: Magnetic Skyrmions

In two dimensions, chiral magnets can host topologically protected, particle-like spin textures known as **[magnetic skyrmions](@entry_id:139956)**. A skyrmion is a localized whorl of spins that, far from its center, merges into a uniform ferromagnetic background. The texture can be characterized by an integer topological invariant called the **[skyrmion](@entry_id:140037) number**, $N_{\text{sk}}$. This number quantifies how many times the magnetization vectors of the texture wrap around the unit sphere. It is defined by the integral over the 2D plane:

$$
N_{\text{sk}} = \frac{1}{4\pi} \int_{\mathbb{R}^2} \mathbf{m} \cdot \left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{m}}{\partial x} \times \frac{\partial \mathbf{m}}{\partial y} \right) \, dx \, dy
$$

The integrand is the topological charge density. For a typical isolated [skyrmion](@entry_id:140037) texture, the magnetization points down at the center ($r=0$, [polar angle](@entry_id:175682) $\theta=\pi$) and points up far from the center ($r\to\infty$, [polar angle](@entry_id:175682) $\theta=0$). A direct calculation for any smooth radial profile $\theta(r)$ satisfying these boundary conditions demonstrates that the [skyrmion](@entry_id:140037) number is determined solely by this topology, yielding $N_{\text{sk}} = -1$ [@problem_id:2534460]. The result is independent of the specific profile, such as the skyrmion's radius or the exact shape of $\theta(r)$. For example, the well-known Belavin-Polyakov profile, $\theta(r) = 2\arctan(R/r)$, which is an exact solution in certain idealized models, also yields $N_{\text{sk}} = -1$, independent of the characteristic radius $R$ or the internal [helicity](@entry_id:157633) $\gamma$ [@problem_id:2534497]. This robustness to continuous deformations is the essence of **[topological protection](@entry_id:145388)**, which makes skyrmions stable entities and promising candidates for future information storage technologies.

### Mechanisms of Unconventional Superconductivity

Conventional superconductivity, as described by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory, arises from electrons forming Cooper pairs mediated by [lattice vibrations](@entry_id:145169) (phonons). This mechanism typically leads to a superconducting order parameter, or [gap function](@entry_id:164997) $\Delta(\mathbf{k})$, that is isotropic (independent of momentum $\mathbf{k}$), nodeless, and has spin-singlet character. Superconductors that deviate from this paradigm are termed **unconventional**. These deviations can manifest in the pairing mechanism (e.g., magnetic fluctuations instead of phonons) and/or in the symmetry of the [gap function](@entry_id:164997).

#### Symmetry Classification of the Superconducting Gap

In a crystalline solid, the superconducting [gap function](@entry_id:164997) $\Delta(\mathbf{k})$ is not arbitrary; it must transform according to one of the **irreducible representations (irreps)** of the crystal's point group. This powerful constraint provides a systematic way to classify and understand the possible pairing states. The parity of the [gap function](@entry_id:164997) is also crucial: an even-parity gap corresponds to a [spin-singlet state](@entry_id:153133), while an odd-parity gap corresponds to a spin-[triplet state](@entry_id:156705). Nodes in the superconducting gap—points or lines on the Fermi surface where $\Delta(\mathbf{k})=0$—are a hallmark of many [unconventional superconductors](@entry_id:141195) and have profound effects on their thermodynamic and transport properties.

Consider a system with a tetragonal $D_{4h}$ point group, relevant to materials like the cuprate high-temperature superconductors. For a quasi-2D cylindrical Fermi surface, we can analyze the [nodal structure](@entry_id:151019) of gaps belonging to different irreps [@problem_id:2534523]:
-   **$A_{1g}$ ([s-wave](@entry_id:754474)):** This is the fully symmetric, even-parity representation. The simplest basis function is a constant, $\Delta(\mathbf{k})=\Delta_0$, which is the conventional, nodeless [s-wave](@entry_id:754474) state. However, other basis functions like $\cos k_x + \cos k_y$ (extended s-wave) or even $k_z^2$ also belong to this irrep. While the former is nodeless on a circular Fermi surface centered at $\Gamma$, the latter would have a horizontal line node at $k_z=0$.
-   **$B_{1g}$ (d-wave):** This even-parity representation is characterized by the basis function $\Delta(\mathbf{k}) \propto \cos k_x - \cos k_y$, often approximated as $k_x^2 - k_y^2$ near the zone center. This function changes sign under a $90^\circ$ rotation. On a cylindrical Fermi surface, the gap vanishes along the lines where $|k_x|=|k_y|$, creating four vertical line nodes. This is the celebrated **$d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave** symmetry, widely established for the [cuprates](@entry_id:142665).
-   **$E_u$ ([p-wave](@entry_id:753062)):** This is a two-dimensional, odd-parity representation, corresponding to [spin-triplet pairing](@entry_id:144256). Its basis functions can be written as a vector $(k_x, k_y)$. A single-component state, such as $\Delta(\mathbf{k}) \propto k_x$, would have vertical line nodes at $k_x=0$. However, a complex linear combination, known as a **chiral p-wave state**, $\Delta(\mathbf{k}) \propto k_x \pm i k_y$, has a magnitude $|\Delta(\mathbf{k})| \propto \sqrt{k_x^2+k_y^2}$ that is constant and non-zero on a circular Fermi surface, resulting in a nodeless triplet state.

#### Magnetic Pairing Mechanisms

In many [unconventional superconductors](@entry_id:141195), the "glue" that binds electrons into Cooper pairs is not phononic but magnetic in origin. Strong electronic correlations can give rise to powerful [spin fluctuations](@entry_id:141847) that mediate an effective attraction between electrons.

A canonical example is the theory of pairing in doped Mott insulators, described by the **Hubbard model** in the strong-coupling limit ($U \gg t$). At half-filling, virtual hopping processes between neighboring sites lead to an effective antiferromagnetic **[superexchange](@entry_id:142159)** interaction, $H_J = J \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} \mathbf{S}_i \cdot \mathbf{S}_j$, with $J = 4t^2/U > 0$. When the system is doped with mobile holes, this same interaction can mediate pairing. The antiferromagnetic nature of the interaction favors a pairing state where the [gap function](@entry_id:164997) changes sign between regions of the Fermi surface connected by the antiferromagnetic [wavevector](@entry_id:178620), $\mathbf{Q}=(\pi, \pi)$. The $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave gap, $\Delta(\mathbf{k}) \propto \cos k_x - \cos k_y$, perfectly satisfies this condition, as $\Delta(\mathbf{k}+\mathbf{Q})=-\Delta(\mathbf{k})$. Furthermore, any short-range repulsion (including on-site repulsion $U$) strongly disfavors isotropic s-wave states but has a minimal effect on the d-wave channel, making it the robustly favored [pairing symmetry](@entry_id:139531) in this mechanism [@problem_id:2534462].

Another magnetic pairing scenario is relevant for multi-band systems like the [iron-based superconductors](@entry_id:138849). These materials possess multiple hole and electron Fermi surface pockets. Here, a repulsive interband interaction can drive superconductivity. Consider a [minimal model](@entry_id:268530) with one hole pocket and one electron pocket, coupled by a repulsive scattering term $\lambda_{he} > 0$. A mean-field analysis shows that a superconducting state can emerge, but only if the gap functions on the two pockets, $\Delta_h$ and $\Delta_e$, have opposite signs: $\Delta_h / \Delta_e  0$. This pairing state is known as the **$s_{\pm}$-wave** state. It is an s-wave state in the sense that the gap is nodeless on each individual pocket, but it is unconventional because the [gap function](@entry_id:164997) changes sign across the Brillouin zone (from one pocket to another). This sign change allows the system to leverage the repulsive interaction to form pairs, in a manner analogous to how the d-wave state leverages the repulsive interaction in momentum space on a single band [@problem_id:2534494].

### Interplay and Competition of Ordered States

Unconventional superconductors are often found in close proximity to other [ordered phases](@entry_id:202961), such as antiferromagnetism, [charge density waves](@entry_id:194795), or electronic [nematic order](@entry_id:187456). The interplay between superconductivity and these other orders leads to extraordinarily rich and complex [phase diagrams](@entry_id:143029). The **Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory** provides a powerful phenomenological framework for describing this interplay by constructing a [free energy expansion](@entry_id:138572) in terms of [coupled order parameters](@entry_id:196194).

Consider a system with a superconducting order parameter $\psi$ and a density-wave order parameter $\phi$. The simplest symmetry-allowed coupling term in the GL free energy is a biquadratic term, $g|\psi|^2\phi^2$. The sign of the [coupling constant](@entry_id:160679) $g$ determines the nature of the interaction:
-   **Competition ($g > 0$):** The two orders tend to suppress each other, vying for the same regions of the Fermi surface.
-   **Cooperation ($g  0$):** The presence of one order promotes the other.

By minimizing the coupled free energy, we can determine how the onset of one order affects the other. For instance, in a system with a pre-existing [density wave](@entry_id:199750), the superconducting transition temperature $T_{sc}^*$ is renormalized from its bare value $T_{sc0}$. The analysis shows that $T_{sc}^*$ is enhanced if the coupling is cooperative ($g  0$) and suppressed if it is competitive ($g > 0$). This provides a quantitative description of the phase diagram near a [quantum critical point](@entry_id:144325) where the density-wave order vanishes [@problem_id:2534535].

A particularly important type of competing/coexisting order is **[electronic nematicity](@entry_id:203425)**, a state that spontaneously breaks the rotational symmetry of the crystal lattice without breaking translational symmetry (e.g., reducing a four-fold $C_4$ symmetry to a two-fold $C_2$ symmetry). Such symmetry lowering can have a profound impact on the superconducting state. In a tetragonal system, nematicity can induce a mixing between superconducting irreps that are otherwise orthogonal. For example, it can couple the $A_{1g}$ ([s-wave](@entry_id:754474)) and $B_{1g}$ (d-wave) channels via a term like $g(\eta, e) \text{Re}(\Delta_s^* \Delta_d)$ in the GL free energy, where $\eta$ is the [nematic order parameter](@entry_id:752404). This mixing means that even if the primary [pairing instability](@entry_id:158107) is in the s-wave channel, a finite [nematic order](@entry_id:187456) will induce a subordinate d-wave component. The resulting superconducting gap will be an admixture of the two symmetries, $\Delta(\mathbf{k}) = \Delta_s + \Delta_d \varphi_d(\mathbf{k})$, with the anisotropy amplitude $\Delta_d/\Delta_s$ being directly proportional to the strength of the [nematic order](@entry_id:187456) [@problem_id:2534478]. This phenomenon highlights how the intricate dance between different electronic orders shapes the ultimate properties of unconventional materials.
