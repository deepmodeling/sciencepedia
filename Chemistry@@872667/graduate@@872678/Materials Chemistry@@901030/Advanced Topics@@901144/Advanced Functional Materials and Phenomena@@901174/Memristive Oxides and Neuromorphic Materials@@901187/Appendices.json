The analysis will determine the dominant charge states under specific electronic conditions and rationalize the defect's behavior.\n\nThe formation energy of a defect with charge state $q$, denoted $E_f(q; E_F)$, is given by its relationship to the Fermi level, which is measured from the valence band maximum (VBM). The standard model for this dependence is a linear relationship:\n$$E_f(q; E_F) = E_f(q; E_F=0) + qE_F$$\nwhere $E_f(q; E_F=0)$ is the formation energy when the Fermi level is at the VBM ($E_F = 0$) and $e$ is the elementary charge, which is taken as unity in this energy-eV formulation.\n\nThe problem provides the following data:\n-   Formation energy of the doubly positive vacancy at the VBM: $E_f(q=+2; E_F=0) = 1.6\\ \\mathrm{eV}$\n-   Formation energy of the singly positive vacancy at the VBM: $E_f(q=+1; E_F=0) = 3.1\\ \\mathrm{eV}$\n-   Formation energy of the neutral vacancy at the VBM: $E_f(q=0; E_F=0) = 4.8\\ \\mathrm{eV}$\n-   Band gap of $\\mathrm{HfO_2}$: $E_g = 5.6\\ \\mathrm{eV}$\n\nUsing the provided formula, we can write the formation energy for each charge state as a function of $E_F$:\n1.  For charge state $q=+2$:\n    $$E_f(+2; E_F) = 1.6 + 2E_F$$\n2.  For charge state $q=+1$:\n    $$E_f(+1; E_F) = 3.1 + E_F$$\n3.  For charge state $q=0$:\n    $$E_f(0; E_F) = 4.8 + 0 \\cdot E_F = 4.8$$\n\nThe thermodynamically stable charge state at any given $E_F$ is the one that possesses the minimum formation energy.\n\n(a) Determination of dominant charge states.\n\nFirst, we consider $p$-type conditions. This corresponds to the Fermi level being close to the valence band maximum, i.e., $E_F \\to 0^{+}$. To find the dominant charge state, we evaluate the formation energies at $E_F = 0$:\n-   $E_f(+2; E_F=0) = 1.6\\ \\mathrm{eV}$\n-   $E_f(+1; E_F=0) = 3.1\\ \\mathrm{eV}$\n-   $E_f(0; E_F=0) = 4.8\\ \\mathrm{eV}$\n\nComparing these values, the minimum energy is $1.6\\ \\mathrm{eV}$, which corresponds to the $q=+2$ charge state. Therefore, under $p$-type conditions, the dominant charge state is $q_p = +2$.\n\nNext, we consider $n$-type conditions. This corresponds to the Fermi level being close to the conduction band minimum (CBM), i.e., $E_F \\to E_g^{-}$. Given $E_g = 5.6\\ \\mathrm{eV}$, we evaluate the formation energies at $E_F = 5.6\\ \\mathrm{eV}$:\n-   $E_f(+2; E_F=5.6) = 1.6 + 2(5.6) = 1.6 + 11.2 = 12.8\\ \\mathrm{eV}$\n-   $E_f(+1; E_F=5.6) = 3.1 + (5.6) = 8.7\\ \\mathrm{eV}$\n-   $E_f(0; E_F=5.6) = 4.8\\ \\mathrm{eV}$\n\nComparing these values, the minimum energy is $4.8\\ \\mathrm{eV}$, which corresponds to the $q=0$ charge state. Therefore, under $n$-type conditions, the dominant charge state is $q_n = 0$.\n\n(b) Inference of donor behavior and impact on resistive switching.\n\nA donor defect is a species that can donate one or more electrons to the host material, thereby acquiring a positive charge. The reactions for the oxygen vacancy donating electrons are $V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{0} \\to V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{+1} + e^-$ and $V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{+1} \\to V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{+2} + e^-$. Our finding that the stable charge state changes from positive ($+2$) at low $E_F$ ($p$-type) to neutral ($0$) at high $E_F$ ($n$-type) confirms that $V_{\\mathrm{O}}$ is a donor. When the Fermi level is low, the defect minimizes its energy by releasing its electrons, becoming positively charged.\n\nTo understand its behavior across the band gap, we calculate the charge transition levels, $\\epsilon(q_1/q_2)$, which are the Fermi level values where the formation energies of two charge states are equal, $E_f(q_1; E_F) = E_f(q_2; E_F)$.\n-   The transition between $q=+2$ and $q=+1$ occurs at $\\epsilon(+2/+1)$:\n    $$1.6 + 2E_F = 3.1 + E_F \\implies E_F = 1.5\\ \\mathrm{eV}$$\n-   The transition between $q=+1$ and $q=0$ occurs at $\\epsilon(+1/0)$:\n    $$3.1 + E_F = 4.8 \\implies E_F = 1.7\\ \\mathrm{eV}$$\n\nSince $\\epsilon(+2/+1) < \\epsilon(+1/0)$, the intermediate charge state $q=+1$ is thermodynamically stable in the Fermi level range from $1.5\\ \\mathrm{eV}$ to $1.7\\ \\mathrm{eV}$. The full sequence of stable charge states as $E_F$ increases from $0$ to $E_g$ is: $q=+2$ for $E_F < 1.5\\ \\mathrm{eV}$, $q=+1$ for $1.5\\ \\mathrm{eV} < E_F < 1.7\\ \\mathrm{eV}$, and $q=0$ for $E_F > 1.7\\ \\mathrm{eV}$. Both transition levels are deep within the band gap, far from both band edges.\n\nIn the context of resistive switching in memristive materials, the behavior of the oxygen vacancy is critical. Resistive switching is understood to arise from the formation and rupture of conductive filaments, which are widely believed to be composed of a high concentration of oxygen vacancies.\n-   **Donor Nature and Carrier Generation**: The donor nature of $V_{\\mathrm{O}}$ implies that it can provide electrons. In a high-density vacancy filament, the defect levels can hybridize to form a defect band within the host material's band gap. The electrons donated by the vacancies populate this band, enabling electronic conduction via hopping or band-like transport, thus creating the low-resistance state (LRS).\n-   **Impact of Charge State**: Under an applied electric field (the SET process), positively charged vacancies ($V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{+2}$ or $V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{+1}$) are mobile and can drift towards the cathode, facilitating the growth of the filament. The neutral state $V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{0}$ is less mobile. The interplay between O$^{2-}$ ion drift and vacancy drift and their charge state transformations ($V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{0} \\leftrightarrow V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{+2} + 2e^-$) underpins the memory effect. The fact that $V_{\\mathrm{O}}$ is stable as a neutral species under $n$-type conditions is significant, as electron injection from the cathode can neutralize positively charged vacancies, affecting their mobility and the stability of the filament. The ability of the vacancy to trap and release electrons is precisely the mechanism needed for switching between a high-resistance state (insulating, few vacancies, or vacancies in a charge state that does not support conduction) and a low-resistance state (conductive filament).\n\nThe final answer addresses part (a) only, as requested.\nFor $p$-type conditions ($E_F \\to 0^{+}$), the dominant charge state is $q_p = +2$.\nFor $n$-type conditions ($E_F \\to E_g^{-}$), the dominant charge state is $q_n = 0$.\nThe required row matrix is $(q_n \\ \\ q_p)$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 2 \\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2499549"}, {"introduction": "Once oxygen vacancies agglomerate to form a conductive filament, the device enters a low-resistance state where significant current can flow.

This rules out a filamentary mechanism and indicates a transport process that is uniform across the entire device area, such as interface-limited or bulk-limited conduction.\n\n2.  **Temperature Dependence in HRS**:\n    Using the same Arrhenius analysis for Device X data between $T_1 = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$ and $T_2 = 400\\,\\mathrm{K}$:\n    $$ E_a = -(8.617 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV/K}) \\frac{\\ln(20\\,\\mu\\mathrm{A}) - \\ln(0.06\\,\\mu\\mathrm{A})}{1/400\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1} - 1/300\\,\\mathrm{K}^{-1}} $$\n    $$ E_a = -(8.617 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV/K}) \\frac{\\ln(20/0.06)}{\\frac{1}{400} - \\frac{1}{300}}\\,\\mathrm{K} $$\n    $$ E_a = -(8.617 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV/K}) \\frac{\\ln(333.33)}{-0.000833}\\,\\mathrm{K} \\approx -(8.617 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV/K}) \\frac{5.809}{-0.000833}\\,\\mathrm{K} $$\n    $$ E_a \\approx -(8.617 \\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV/K}) \\times (-6974\\,\\mathrm{K}) \\approx +0.60\\,\\mathrm{eV} $$\n    The current increases strongly with temperature, and the calculated activation energy is large and positive, approximately $E_a \\approx 0.6\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. This is characteristic of a thermally activated transport process over an energy barrier.\n\n*Conclusion for HRS*: The conduction is area-dependent and is a thermally activated process with $E_a \\approx 0.6\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. This is consistent with transport across a uniform potential barrier, such as interface-limited Schottky emission.\n\nFinally, we evaluate the provided options against these findings.\n\nA. **LRS is filamentary ohmic conduction (area-independent current and near-zero or slightly negative apparent activation energy); HRS is interface-limited Schottky emission (current proportional to device area and a positive apparent activation energy of approximately $0.6\\,\\mathrm{eV}$).**\n- This statement is in complete agreement with our detailed analysis of both the LRS and HRS. The area dependence and activation energy for each state are correctly identified. The calculated HRS activation energy of $0.6\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ is explicitly mentioned. **Correct.**\n\nB. **LRS is interface-limited Schottky emission; HRS is filamentary ohmic conduction.**\n- This option reverses the correct mechanisms. LRS is not area-dependent, and HRS is not area-independent. **Incorrect.**\n\nC. **Both LRS and HRS are interface-limited Schottky emission with different barrier heights, as indicated by strong positive activation energies and linear scaling of current with area in both states.**\n- This is incorrect because the LRS current does not scale with area, and it has a negative, not positive, activation energy. **Incorrect.**\n\nD. **LRS is bulk-limited Poole–Frenkel emission and HRS is interface-limited Schottky emission; the LRS area independence and slightly negative activation energy are consistent with bulk-limited hopping in the oxide.**\n- This option incorrectly identifies the LRS mechanism. Bulk-limited mechanisms like Poole-Frenkel emission imply uniform conduction and should scale with area, contradicting the data. Furthermore, the justification provided within the option is flawed: area independence is characteristic of filaments, not bulk processes, and a negative activation energy is characteristic of metals, not thermally activated hopping in an oxide. **Incorrect.**\n\nBased on rigorous analysis, only option A is consistent with the experimental data.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2499558"}]}
