The mass fractions of the phases are defined as:\n$$\nf_{\\alpha} = \\frac{m_{\\alpha}}{m_{total}} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad f_{\\theta} = \\frac{m_{\\theta}}{m_{total}}\n$$\nAs these are the only two phases present in a closed system, the law of conservation of mass dictates that the sum of their masses equals the total mass:\n$$\nm_{\\alpha} + m_{\\theta} = m_{total}\n$$\nDividing by $m_{total}$ yields the first fundamental relationship between the mass fractions:\n$$\nf_{\\alpha} + f_{\\theta} = 1\n$$\nThis is the total mass balance equation.\n\nNext, we establish a mass balance for the carbon component. The total mass of carbon in the alloy is the product of the overall carbon concentration $C_{0}$ and the total mass $m_{total}$.
