This condition justifies the use of a continuous dielectric medium and the effective mass approximation.\nWe compare $a_{B}^{\\ast} = 4.23\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ with the lattice constant $a = 0.56\\,\\mathrm{nm}$.\nThe ratio is $\\frac{a_{B}^{\\ast}}{a} = \\frac{4.23}{0.56} \\approx 7.55$. Since $a_{B}^{\\ast}$ is more than seven times the lattice constant, the condition $a_{B}^{\\ast} \\gg a$ is satisfied. The exciton is delocalized over many unit cells.\n\nThe term \"weak-binding\" implies the binding energy $E_b$ is small compared to both the semiconductor band gap (typically $\\sim 1\\,\\mathrm{eV}$) and, for practical purposes, the thermal energy at the operating temperature. We compare $E_b$ to the thermal energy $k_B T$ at $T=300\\,\\mathrm{K}$.\n$$\nk_B T = (8.617333262\\times 10^{-5}\\,\\mathrm{eV\\,K^{-1}}) \\times 300\\,\\mathrm{K} \\approx 0.02585\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 25.85\\,\\mathrm{meV}\n$$\nWe find that $E_{b} \\approx 14.2\\,\\mathrm{meV} < 25.85\\,\\mathrm{meV}$. The binding energy is smaller than the available thermal energy at room temperature. This confirms that the exciton is weakly bound and would be thermally unstable at $300\\,\\mathrm{K}$, necessitating cryogenic temperatures for stable observation. Both assessments confirm the applicability of the Wannier-Mott description.\n\nThe final answer requires only the numerical values for $E_b$ and $a_{B}^{\\ast}$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 14.2 & 4.23 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2487081"}, {"introduction": "The intrinsic size of an exciton, its effective Bohr radius, becomes a critical parameter when charge carriers are confined within nanoscale structures.

The problem is a standard exercise in semiconductor physics and materials science, requiring the application of fundamental principles rather than speculation.\n\nThe solution proceeds in three parts as requested.\n\nPart 1: Derivation of the effective exciton Bohr radius, $a_{B}^{\\ast}$.\n\nThe quantum mechanical description of the relative motion of an electron-hole pair is analogous to the hydrogen atom problem. The time-independent Schrödinger equation for the relative coordinate $\\vec{r}$ of a particle with reduced mass $\\mu$ moving in a central potential $V(r)$ is:\n$$\n\\left( -\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2\\mu} \\nabla^{2} + V(r) \\right) \\psi(\\vec{r}) = E \\psi(\\vec{r})\n$$\nFor the exciton in the semiconductor, the potential is the screened Coulomb interaction, $V(r) = -\\frac{e^{2}}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} \\varepsilon r}$. Thus, the exciton's Hamiltonian for relative motion is:\n$$\nH_{\\text{ex}} = -\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2\\mu} \\nabla^{2} - \\frac{e^{2}}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} \\varepsilon r}\n$$\nFor the hydrogen atom in vacuum, the Hamiltonian describes an electron of mass $m_{0}$ (approximating the reduced mass of the electron-proton system as $m_0$) orbiting a proton, with the potential $V(r) = -\\frac{e^{2}}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}$. The corresponding Hamiltonian is:\n$$\nH_{\\text{H}} = -\\frac{\\hbar^{2}}{2m_{0}} \\nabla^{2} - \\frac{e^{2}}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r}\n$$\nThe Bohr radius, $a_{B}$, is the most probable radial position of the electron in the ground state of the hydrogen atom and is given by the expression:\n$$\na_{B} = \\frac{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} \\hbar^{2}}{m_{0} e^{2}}\n$$\nThe exciton problem is mathematically identical to the hydrogen atom problem with the following substitutions: the vacuum permittivity $\\varepsilon_{0}$ is replaced by the medium's effective permittivity $\\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon$, and the electron mass $m_{0}$ is replaced by the exciton's reduced effective mass $\\mu$.\nBy applying these substitutions to the expression for $a_{B}$, we obtain the effective exciton Bohr radius, $a_{B}^{\\ast}$:\n$$\na_{B}^{\\ast} = \\frac{4\\pi (\\varepsilon_{0}\\varepsilon) \\hbar^{2}}{\\mu e^{2}} = \\varepsilon \\left( \\frac{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} \\hbar^{2}}{\\mu e^{2}} \\right)\n$$\nTo express $a_{B}^{\\ast}$ in terms of $a_{B}$, we rearrange the definition of $a_{B}$ to isolate the fundamental constants: $\\frac{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} \\hbar^{2}}{e^{2}} = m_{0} a_{B}$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $a_{B}^{\\ast}$:\n$$\na_{B}^{\\ast} = \\varepsilon \\frac{m_{0} a_{B}}{\\mu} = a_{B} \\left( \\frac{\\varepsilon m_{0}}{\\mu} \\right)\n$$\nThis is the required expression for the effective exciton Bohr radius.\n\nPart 2: Criterion for weak- versus strong-confinement crossover.\n\nThe effective exciton Bohr radius, $a_{B}^{\\ast}$, represents the characteristic length scale, or \"size,\" of the bound electron-hole pair in the bulk semiconductor. The quantum dot imposes a spatial confinement on the charge carriers, defined by its radius, $R$. The interplay between these two length scales, $a_{B}^{\\ast}$ and $R$, determines the confinement regime.\n\n- **Weak-confinement regime**: This regime occurs when the quantum dot is significantly larger than the exciton, i.e., $R \\gg a_{B}^{\\ast}$. In this case, the electron and hole can form a correlated pair whose internal structure is only slightly perturbed by the boundary. The exciton behaves as a quasi-particle, and its center-of-mass motion is quantized by the confining potential of the dot. The dominant energy scale is the Coulomb interaction.\n\n- **Strong-confinement regime**: This regime occurs when the quantum dot is significantly smaller than the bulk exciton size, i.e., $R \\ll a_{B}^{\\ast}$. Here, the individual confinement of the electron and hole by the dot's boundaries is the dominant effect. The quantization energies of the electron and hole (particle-in-a-sphere energies) are much larger than their mutual Coulomb attraction energy. They behave as nearly independent particles, and the Coulomb term can be treated as a perturbation.\n\nThe crossover between these two regimes logically occurs when the physical size of the confinement potential, $R$, becomes comparable to the natural size of the exciton, $a_{B}^{\\ast}$. Therefore, a clear and physically motivated criterion for the crossover boundary is when these two length scales are equal. We define the crossover radius, $R_{c}$, as the radius at which this occurs:\n$$\nR_{c} = a_{B}^{\\ast}\n$$\n\nPart 3: Calculation of the crossover radius $R_{c}$.\n\nUsing the criterion from Part 2 and the expression for $a_{B}^{\\ast}$ from Part 1, we can compute the value of $R_{c}$.
