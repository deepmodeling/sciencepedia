We are concerned with the average momentum $\\langle \\mathbf{p} \\rangle$ per electron, which gives rise to a net drift. The random thermal motions have an average momentum of zero. In the steady state, the average momentum of the electron gas does not change with time, thus $\\frac{d\\langle \\mathbf{p} \\rangle}{dt} = 0$.

The problem is well-posed, with all necessary information provided and a clear set of tasks leading to a unique solution. The language is objective and unambiguous. The problem setup is self-contained and free of internal contradictions. There are no elements of pseudoscience, infeasibility, or poor structure.\n\n### Step 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is valid. A solution will be provided.\n\nThe derivation of the electrical conductivity $\\sigma$ begins with the equation of motion for an average electron within the Drude model. Newton's second law, applied to an electron of charge $-e$ and effective mass $m_e^*$ in a uniform electric field $\\vec{E}$, includes a phenomenological damping term representing momentum loss due to scattering, characterized by an average relaxation time $\\tau$. The equation for the average momentum $\\vec{p}$ is:\n$$ \\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dt} = -e\\vec{E} - \\frac{\\vec{p}}{\\tau} $$\nUnder a constant electric field, the electrons reach a constant average drift velocity, which implies a constant average steady-state momentum $\\vec{p}_{ss}$. In this steady state, the time derivative of the average momentum is zero, $\\frac{d\\vec{p}_{ss}}{dt} = 0$. The equation of motion simplifies to:\n$$ 0 = -e\\vec{E} - \\frac{\\vec{p}_{ss}}{\\tau} $$\nSolving for the steady-state momentum gives:\n$$ \\vec{p}_{ss} = -e\\tau\\vec{E} $$\nThe average drift velocity $\\vec{v}_d$ of the electrons is related to the average momentum by $\\vec{p}_{ss} = m_e^* \\vec{v}_d$. Thus, the drift velocity is:\n$$ \\vec{v}_d = \\frac{\\vec{p}_{ss}}{m_e^*} = -\\frac{e\\tau}{m_e^*}\\vec{E} $$\nThe problem instructs us to use the definition of electron mobility, $\\mu_n$, which is the magnitude of the proportionality factor between the drift velocity and the applied electric field. For electrons, which drift opposite to the field, this is written as:\n$$ \\vec{v}_d = -\\mu_n\\vec{E} $$\nThis definition provides the necessary link between microscopic dynamics and the macroscopic transport parameter $\\mu_n$.\n\nThe next step is to relate the drift velocity to the electrical current density, $\\vec{J}$. The current density is the amount of charge passing through a unit area per unit time. For an electron concentration of $n$, with each electron carrying charge $-e$ and moving with an average drift velocity $\\vec{v}_d$, the current density is:\n$$ \\vec{J} = n(-e)\\vec{v}_d $$\nSubstituting the definition of mobility into this expression for $\\vec{J}$:\n$$ \\vec{J} = n(-e)(-\\mu_n\\vec{E}) $$\nThis simplifies to:\n$$ \\vec{J} = ne\\mu_n\\vec{E} $$\nFinally, the electrical conductivity $\\sigma$ is defined by the microscopic form of Ohm's Law, $\\vec{J} = \\sigma\\vec{E}$. By direct comparison of our derived expression for $\\vec{J}$ with Ohm's Law, we identify the expression for conductivity:\n$$ \\sigma = ne\\mu_n $$\nThis completes the required derivation.\n\nFor the numerical evaluation, we are given:\n- $n = 1.0 \\times 10^{16}\\,\\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$\n- $\\mu_{n} = 1400\\,\\mathrm{cm^{2}/(V \\cdot s)}$\n- $e = 1.602 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$\n\nThe final result must be in SI units of Siemens per meter ($\\mathrm{S/m}$).

The provided data values are physically realistic for a simple metal. The problem is well-posed; it provides all necessary information and a clear set of objectives that lead to a unique solution. The language is objective and precise. The problem does not violate any fundamental principles, is not based on false premises, and contains no contradictions. Therefore, the problem is deemed valid.\n\nWe proceed with the solution, which is composed of three parts.\n\nPart 1: Fitting the parameters $\\rho_{0}$ and $\\alpha$.\nThe problem states that the model $\\rho(T) = \\rho_{0} + \\alpha T$ holds exactly for the given data. This implies the data points lie perfectly on a straight line in the $\\rho-T$ plane. We can therefore determine the slope $\\alpha$ and the intercept $\\rho_{0}$ using any two data points, which is simpler than performing a full linear regression. Let us use the first two data points: ($T_1 = 100\\ \\mathrm{K}, \\rho_1 = 1.82 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\Omega\\ \\mathrm{m}$) and ($T_2 = 150\\ \\mathrm{K}, \\rho_2 = 1.98 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\Omega\\ \\mathrm{m}$).\n\nThe slope $\\alpha$ is given by:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{\\Delta \\rho}{\\Delta T} = \\frac{\\rho_2 - \\rho_1}{T_2 - T_1} = \\frac{(1.98 - 1.82) \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\Omega\\ \\mathrm{m}}{(150 - 100)\\ \\mathrm{K}} = \\frac{0.16 \\times 10^{-8}\\ \\Omega\\ \\mathrm{m}}{50\\ \\mathrm{K}} = 3.2 \\times 10^{-11}\\ \\Omega\\ \\mathrm{m}\\ \\mathrm{K}^{-1}\n$$\nThe residual resistivity $\\rho_{0}$ can be found by substituting $\\alpha$ and one data point into the model.

The electrical resistivity, $\\rho$, is the reciprocal of conductivity:\n$$\n\\rho = \\frac{1}{\\sigma} = \\frac{m^{\\ast}}{n e^2 \\tau}\n$$\nMatthiessen's rule states that for independent scattering mechanisms, the total scattering rate, $1/\\tau$, is the sum of the individual scattering rates. In a real metal, the dominant scattering mechanisms are:\n1.  Scattering from temperature-independent static lattice defects, such as impurities, vacancies, and grain boundaries. We denote this rate as $1/\\tau_{0}$.\n2.  Scattering from temperature-dependent lattice vibrations (phonons). We denote this rate as $1/\\tau_{\\mathrm{ph}}(T)$.\n\nAccording to Matthiessen's rule, the total scattering rate is:\n$$\n\\frac{1}{\\tau} = \\frac{1}{\\tau_{0}} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{ph}}(T)}\n$$\nSubstituting this into the resistivity expression gives:\n$$\n\\rho(T) = \\frac{m^{\\ast}}{n e^2} \\left( \\frac{1}{\\tau_{0}} + \\frac{1}{\\tau_{\\mathrm{ph}}(T)} \\right) = \\frac{m^{\\ast}}{n e^2 \\tau_{0}} + \\frac{m^{\\ast}}{n e^2 \\tau_{\\mathrm{ph}}(T)}\n$$\nThis equation decomposes the total resistivity into two additive terms:\n$$\n\\rho(T) = \\rho_{0} + \\rho_{\\mathrm{ph}}(T)\n$$\nHere, we identify the microscopic meaning of the first term:\n$$\n\\rho_{0} = \\frac{m^{\\ast}}{n e^2 \\tau_{0}}\n$$\nThis is the residual resistivity, originating from scattering by static defects. It is independent of temperature.\n\nThe second term, $\\rho_{\\mathrm{ph}}(T)$, is the temperature-dependent resistivity due to electron-phonon scattering. At high temperatures (typically above the Debye temperature), the number of phonons is proportional to the absolute temperature $T$. The scattering rate of electrons by phonons is also proportional to $T$. This is expressed by the given relation $1/\\tau_{\\mathrm{ph}}(T) = A\\,T$, where $A$ is the electron-phonon scattering coefficient.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\rho_{\\mathrm{ph}}(T)$:\n$$\n\\rho_{\\mathrm{ph}}(T) = \\frac{m^{\\ast}}{n e^2} \\left( A\\,T \\right) = \\left( \\frac{m^{\\ast} A}{n e^2} \\right) T\n$$\nBy comparing this with the empirical linear model $\\rho(T) = \\rho_{0} + \\alpha T$, we can identify the linear coefficient $\\alpha$:\n$$\n\\alpha = \\frac{m^{\\ast} A}{n e^2}\n$$\nThis coefficient $\\alpha$ represents the rate of increase of resistivity with temperature due to electron-phonon scattering. This completes the derivation and the interpretation.\n\nPart 3: Computation of the scattering coefficient $A$.\nFrom Part 2, we have the relationship $\\alpha = \\frac{m^{\\ast} A}{n e^2}$.
