The a priori instruction is to \"Treat the data as lying exactly on a straight line\". A direct calculation of the slope of $\\ln K$ versus $1/T$ between successive data points reveals this is not strictly correct. For instance, the slope between $T_1=800$ K and $T_2=900$ K is approximately $-15649$ K, while between $T_2=900$ K and $T_3=1000$ K, it is approximately $-15768$ K. This indicates slight non-linearity in the provided data, likely resulting from the rounding of the equilibrium constant values. However, the problem is not invalidated by this minor inconsistency, as the data exhibit a strong linear trend consistent with the underlying physical model. Such deviations are typical of experimental data. The most scientifically rigorous approach to determine the parameters from a set of data points expected to follow a linear model is to perform a least-squares linear regression. The instruction to assume an exact linear relationship is therefore interpreted as a directive to apply the van't Hoff model, and linear regression is the appropriate method for its application to the data set. Thus, the problem is deemed valid and solvable.\n\nFirst, we derive the required relationship. The problem concerns intrinsic cation Frenkel disorder in a stoichiometric binary ionic crystal, which we may denote as $MX$. The formation of a Frenkel pair on the cation sublattice involves a cation $M$ moving from its regular lattice site, denoted $M_M$, to an interstitial site, $i$. This process creates a cation vacancy, $V_M$, and an interstitial cation, $M_i$. In Kröger-Vink notation, the reaction is written as:\n$$M_M^x \\rightleftharpoons M_i^\\bullet + V_M'$$\nHere, the superscript $x$ denotes a neutral effective charge relative to the perfect lattice, $\\bullet$ denotes an effective charge of $+1$ (as the monovalent cation $M^+$ occupies a site that is normally empty and thus neutral), and $'$ denotes an effective charge of $-1$ (as the vacancy is created on a site that should be occupied by a positive ion $M^+$).\n\nThe law of mass action relates the activities of the products and reactants at equilibrium through the equilibrium constant, $K$:\n$$K = \\frac{a_{M_i^\\bullet} \\cdot a_{V_M'}}{a_{M_M^x}}$$\nThe problem states to assume the dilute limit, where activities ($a$) can be approximated by site fractions (denoted by square brackets $[\\dots]$), and the activity of regular lattice sites is approximately unity ($a_{M_M^x} = [M_M^x] \\approx 1$). Thus, the expression simplifies to:\n$$K = [M_i^\\bullet][V_M']$$\nFor intrinsic defects, charge neutrality requires the concentration of positively charged defects to equal that of negatively charged defects. Since these are the only defects considered, $[M_i^\\bullet] = [V_M']$.\nThe problem provides the thermodynamic identities for the standard Gibbs free energy change of reaction ($\\Delta G^{\\circ}$):\n$$\\Delta G^{\\circ} = \\Delta H^{\\circ} - T \\Delta S^{\\circ}$$\nand its relation to the equilibrium constant $K$:\n$$\\Delta G^{\\circ} = -RT \\ln K$$\nwhere $\\Delta H^{\\circ}$ is the standard enthalpy change, $\\Delta S^{\\circ}$ is the standard entropy change, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature.\n\nBy equating these two expressions for $\\Delta G^{\\circ}$, we obtain the van't Hoff equation:\n$$-RT \\ln K = \\Delta H^{\\circ} - T \\Delta S^{\\circ}$$\nDividing both sides by $-RT$ yields the desired linear relationship:\n$$\\ln K = -\\frac{\\Delta H^{\\circ}}{RT} + \\frac{\\Delta S^{\\circ}}{R}$$\nThis equation is in the form of a straight line, $y = mx + c$, where:\n- The dependent variable is $y = \\ln K$.\n- The independent variable is $x = \\frac{1}{T}$.\n- The slope is $m = -\\frac{\\Delta H^{\\circ}}{R}$.\n- The y-intercept is $c = \\frac{\\Delta S^{\\circ}}{R}$.\n\nThe physical meaning of the slope and intercept can be explained in terms of the formation parameters of the Frenkel pair. The term $\\Delta H^{\\circ}$ is the standard molar enthalpy of Frenkel pair formation, which we denote as $\\Delta H_f$. It represents the energy required to create one mole of Frenkel pairs (one mole of cation vacancies and one mole of interstitial cations). Since energy must be supplied to the crystal to move an ion from a stable lattice site to a higher-energy interstitial site, this process is endothermic, meaning $\\Delta H_f > 0$. Consequently, the slope $m$ of a plot of $\\ln K$ versus $1/T$ must be negative.\nThe term $\\Delta S^{\\circ}$ is the standard molar entropy of Frenkel pair formation, $\\Delta S_f$. It represents the change in the non-configurational entropy of the crystal upon forming one mole of Frenkel pairs. This primarily consists of changes in the vibrational modes of the atoms surrounding the newly created vacancy and interstitial defects.\n\nTo determine the molar enthalpy of Frenkel pair formation, $\\Delta H_f$, we perform a linear regression on the provided data for $\\ln K$ versus $1/T$. The data are tabulated as follows, with $x = 1/T$ and $y = \\ln K$:\n\n| $T$ (K) | $K$                  | $x = 1/T$ (K$^{-1}$) | $y = \\ln K$       |\n|---------|----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|\n| $800$   | $6.12 \\times 10^{-8}$  | $0.00125$             | $-16.60905$       |\n| $900$   | $5.41 \\times 10^{-7}$  | $0.001111\\dots$       | $-14.43615$       |\n| $1000$  | $3.10 \\times 10^{-6}$  | $0.001$               | $-12.68413$       |\n| $1100$  | $1.29 \\times 10^{-5}$  | $0.000909\\dots$       | $-11.25920$       |\n\nThe slope $m$ of the best-fit line for a set of data points $(x_i, y_i)$ is given by the formula for least-squares regression:\n$$m = \\frac{N \\sum(x_i y_i) - (\\sum x_i)(\\sum y_i)}{N \\sum(x_i^2) - (\\sum x_i)^2}$$\nwhere $N=4$ is the number of data points.

A direct analytical solution is difficult. However, in such systems, the charge neutrality condition is typically dominated by only two species. We can identify the dominant balance by assuming a simplified neutrality condition and then verifying its consistency.\n\nLet us hypothesize that the dominant charge balance is between oxygen vacancies and electrons, as is common at low oxygen partial pressures: $2\\theta_{V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\bullet\\bullet}} \\approx \\theta_{e^{\\prime}}$.\nUsing this approximation:\n$$\n2\\theta_{V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\bullet\\bullet}} \\approx \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}}{\\sqrt{\\theta_{V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\bullet\\bullet}}}}\n$$\n$$\n2(\\theta_{V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\bullet\\bullet}})^{3/2} \\approx 1.0 \\times 10^{-3}\n$$\n$$\n(\\theta_{V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\bullet\\bullet}})^{3/2} \\approx 5.0 \\times 10^{-4}\n$$\n$$\n\\theta_{V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\bullet\\bullet}} \\approx (5.0 \\times 10^{-4})^{2/3} \\approx 6.2996 \\times 10^{-3}\n$$\nNow we must check the validity of this approximation by calculating all four defect concentrations using $\\theta_{V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\bullet\\bullet}} \\approx 6.30 \\times 10^{-3}$ and substituting them back into the full charge neutrality equation.\n- $\\theta_{V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\bullet\\bullet}} \\approx 6.30 \\times 10^{-3}$\n- $\\theta_{e^{\\prime}} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}}{\\sqrt{6.30 \\times 10^{-3}}} \\approx \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-3}}{7.937 \\times 10^{-2}} \\approx 1.26 \\times 10^{-2}$\n- $\\theta_{V_{\\mathrm{A}}^{\\prime\\prime}} = \\frac{1.0 \\times 10^{-8}}{6.30 \\times 10^{-3}} \\approx 1.59 \\times 10^{-6}$\n- $\\theta_{h^{\\bullet}} = (1.0 \\times 10^{-17})\\sqrt{6.30 \\times 10^{-3}} \\approx 7.94 \\times 10^{-19}$\n\nLet's check the charge balance: $2\\theta_{V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\bullet\\bullet}} + \\theta_{h^{\\bullet}} = 2\\theta_{V_{\\mathrm{A}}^{\\prime\\prime}} + \\theta_{e^{\\prime}}$.\nLeft side: $2(6.30 \\times 10^{-3}) + 7.94 \\times 10^{-19} = 1.26 \\times 10^{-2} + 7.94 \\times 10^{-19} \\approx 1.26 \\times 10^{-2}$\nRight side: $2(1.59 \\times 10^{-6}) + 1.26 \\times 10^{-2} = 3.18 \\times 10^{-6} + 1.26 \\times 10^{-2} \\approx 1.26 \\times 10^{-2}$\n\nThe concentrations of the minority charge carriers are negligible compared to the majority ones:\n- $\\theta_{h^{\\bullet}} \\approx 7.94 \\times 10^{-19} \\ll 2\\theta_{V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\bullet\\bullet}} \\approx 1.26 \\times 10^{-2}$\n- $2\\theta_{V_{\\mathrm{A}}^{\\prime\\prime}} \\approx 3.18 \\times 10^{-6} \\ll \\theta_{e^{\\prime}} \\approx 1.26 \\times 10^{-2}$\nThe approximation $2\\theta_{V_{\\mathrm{O}}^{\\bullet\\bullet}} \\approx \\theta_{e^{\\prime}}$ is therefore demonstrated to be self-consistent and highly accurate for the given parameters.
