Second, the determination of the theoretical maximum Schmid factor. We begin by establishing the fundamental relationship from first principles as required.\n\nFor a uniaxial tensile stress of magnitude $\\sigma$ applied along the direction of a unit vector $\\mathbf{p}$, the Cauchy stress tensor is $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\sigma (\\mathbf{p} \\otimes \\mathbf{p})$. A slip system is defined by the slip plane unit normal vector $\\mathbf{n}$ and the slip direction unit vector $\\mathbf{s}$, which are mutually orthogonal, i.e., $\\mathbf{n} \\cdot \\mathbf{s} = 0$. The traction vector $\\mathbf{t}$ on the slip plane is given by Cauchy's law:\n$$\n\\mathbf{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = \\big(\\sigma (\\mathbf{p} \\otimes \\mathbf{p})\\big) \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = \\sigma (\\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{n})\\mathbf{p}\n$$\nThe resolved shear stress, $\\tau_{\\mathrm{RSS}}$, is the scalar projection of the traction vector $\\mathbf{t}$ onto the slip direction $\\mathbf{s}$:\n$$\n\\tau_{\\mathrm{RSS}} = \\mathbf{t} \\cdot \\mathbf{s} = \\big(\\sigma (\\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{n})\\mathbf{p}\\big) \\cdot \\mathbf{s} = \\sigma (\\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{n})(\\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{s})\n$$\nThe angles $\\phi$ and $\\lambda$ are defined as the angle between the tensile axis and the slip-plane normal, and the angle between the tensile axis and the slip direction, respectively. Thus, $\\cos\\phi = \\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{n}$ and $\\cos\\lambda = \\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{s}$. The Schmid factor, $m$, is defined as $m \\equiv \\tau_{\\mathrm{RSS}}/\\sigma$, which gives the expression:\n$$\nm = \\cos\\phi \\cos\\lambda\n$$\nPlastic deformation is governed by the magnitude of the resolved shear stress, so we seek the maximum value of $|m|$.\n\nFirst, we determine the Schmid factor for the specified loading condition. The crystal is face-centered cubic (FCC), and the uniaxial tensile stress $\\sigma$ is applied along the crystallographic direction $[100]$. The loading direction unit vector is therefore $\\mathbf{p} = [1,0,0]$. The active slip systems are of the $\\{111\\}\\langle 110\\rangle$ family. A plane normal vector is of the form $[hkl]$ where $h, k, l$ are permutations of $\\pm 1$. The corresponding unit vector is $\\mathbf{n} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}[hkl]$. A slip direction vector is of the form $[uvw]$ where $u,v,w$ are permutations of $\\pm 1, \\pm 1, 0$. The corresponding unit vector is $\\mathbf{s} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[uvw]$.\nWe calculate the dot products for the general case with $\\mathbf{p} = [1,0,0]$:\n$$\n\\cos\\phi = \\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = [1,0,0] \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}[hkl] = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}}\n$$\n$$\n\\cos\\lambda = \\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{s} = [1,0,0] \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}[uvw] = \\frac{u}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nThe Schmid factor is then $m = \\frac{hu}{\\sqrt{6}}$. To find the most favorably oriented system, we must find the combination of a valid slip plane and slip direction that maximizes $|m|$. The value of $|h|$ for a $\\{111\\}$ plane is always $1$. The value of $|u|$ for a $\\langle 110\\rangle$ direction can be $1$ or $0$. The maximum magnitude of $m$ is attained when $|h|=1$ and $|u|=1$, which gives $|m| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}$. We must verify that such a slip system exists. Consider the slip plane $(111)$, for which $\\mathbf{n} \\propto [111]$ and $h=1$. The slip directions in this plane must be orthogonal to $[111]$. The direction $[10\\bar{1}]$ is of the $\\langle 110\\rangle$ family, and its dot product with $[111]$ is $(1)(1) + (1)(0) + (1)(-1) = 0$. So, $(111)[10\\bar{1}]$ is a valid slip system. For this system, $h=1$ and $u=1$, giving $m = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}$. There are $8$ such systems with $|m| = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}}$ and $4$ systems with $m=0$. Thus, the Schmid factor for the most favorably oriented system under $[100]$ loading is $m_{[100]} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{6}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{6}$.\n\nSecond, we determine the maximum possible value of the Schmid factor over all possible tensile axis orientations for a fixed slip system. We wish to maximize $m = \\cos\\phi \\cos\\lambda$ where $\\phi$ and $\\lambda$ are orientation-dependent. Let the fixed slip system be defined by the orthonormal vectors $\\mathbf{n}$ and $\\mathbf{s}$. Without loss of generality, we can align our coordinate system such that $\\mathbf{s} = [1,0,0]$ and $\\mathbf{n} = [0,1,0]$. The tensile axis is a general unit vector $\\mathbf{p} = [p_1, p_2, p_3]$ with the constraint $p_1^2 + p_2^2 + p_3^2 = 1$. The dot products are:\n$$\n\\cos\\lambda = \\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{s} = p_1\n$$\n$$\n\\cos\\phi = \\mathbf{p} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = p_2\n$$\nWe must maximize the function $m(p_1, p_2, p_3) = p_1 p_2$ subject to the constraint $p_1^2 + p_2^2 + p_3^2 = 1$. To maximize the product $p_1 p_2$ for a given sum of squares, we must set $p_3=0$. The problem reduces to maximizing $m(p_1, p_2) = p_1 p_2$ subject to $p_1^2 + p_2^2 = 1$. Using a parameterization $p_1 = \\cos\\theta$ and $p_2 = \\sin\\theta$, the expression becomes $m(\\theta) = \\cos\\theta \\sin\\theta = \\frac{1}{2}\\sin(2\\theta)$. The maximum value of $\\sin(2\\theta)$ is $1$, which occurs when $2\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$, or $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$. The maximum value of the Schmid factor is therefore $m_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{2}$.\nThe angles $\\phi_{\\max}$ and $\\lambda_{\\max}$ correspond to this optimal orientation. At $\\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$:\n$$\n\\cos\\lambda_{\\max} = p_1 = \\cos\\Big(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\Big) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\n$$\n\\cos\\phi_{\\max} = p_2 = \\sin\\Big(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\Big) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\nThis yields the angles $\\lambda_{\\max} = \\arccos\\big(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\big) = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ radians and $\\phi_{\\max} = \\arccos\\big(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\big) = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$ radians. This demonstrates that the theoretical maximum Schmid factor is $m_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{2}$, achieved when the tensile axis is oriented at an angle of $\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ to both the slip direction and the slip plane normal.\n\nThe final answer is the row matrix $(m_{[100]},\\,m_{\\max},\\,\\phi_{\\max},\\,\\lambda_{\\max})$.\n$m_{[100]} = \\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{6}$\n$m_{\\max} = \\frac{1}{2}$\n$\\phi_{\\max} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$\n$\\lambda_{\\max} = \\frac{\\pi}{4}$", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{6} & \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{\\pi}{4} & \\frac{\\pi}{4}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n}\n$$", "id": "2523230"}, {"introduction": "As dislocations glide and multiply, their interactions become a dominant factor in a material's mechanical response, leading to work hardening.

A dislocation is sessile if its Burgers vector does not lie in a slip plane, preventing it from gliding. The potential glide plane for a dislocation must contain both its line direction, $\\xi$, and its Burgers vector, $\\mathbf{b}$. The normal to this potential glide plane, $\\mathbf{n}$, is therefore orthogonal to both vectors and can be found by their cross product: $\\mathbf{n} \\propto \\xi \\times \\mathbf{b}_{3}$.\n\nThe problem states that the dislocation lines are parallel to the intersection of the two slip planes, $(111)$ and $(11\\bar{1})$, which is the direction $[1\\bar{1}0]$.

In FCC crystals, slip occurs on the close-packed $\\{111\\}$ family of planes. The $(001)$ plane is not a recognized slip plane under normal conditions. As the product dislocation cannot glide on its potential glide plane, it is by definition sessile.\n\nThe third task is to verify that the reaction is energetically favorable using Frank's rule. This rule states that a dislocation reaction will proceed if the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of the product Burgers vectors is less than that of the reactants.
