The term \"crack growth resistance\" with units of $\\mathrm{J/m^2}$ is standard nomenclature for the critical energy release rate, $G_c$.

It is a standard, formalizable problem in the field of materials chemistry and mechanics.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is deemed **valid**. A solution will be derived from first principles as requested.\n\n**Derivation of the Solution**\nThe problem requires the application of the Griffith energy criterion for brittle fracture. This criterion states that a crack will propagate when the rate of elastic energy released from the system per unit of crack extension, known as the energy release rate $G$, is equal to the energy required to create new crack surfaces per unit of crack extension. This latter quantity is the material's crack growth resistance, or fracture toughness, which is given as $\\gamma$. The critical condition for the onset of unstable crack growth is thus:\n$$G = G_c = \\gamma$$\nFor a crack in a body under load, the energy release rate $G$ is related to the mode I stress intensity factor, $K_I$. For a material under plane stress conditions, as specified in the problem, this relationship is:\n$$G = \\frac{K_I^2}{E}$$\nwhere $E$ is the Young's modulus.\n\nThe geometry is a large plate containing a central through-thickness crack of total length $2a$, subjected to a uniform far-field tensile stress $\\sigma$. For this canonical configuration, the mode I stress intensity factor is given by the well-established formula:\n$$K_I = \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a}$$\nwhere $a$ is the half-crack length.\n\nBy substituting the expression for $K_I$ into the equation for $G$, we obtain the energy release rate as a function of the applied stress and crack size:\n$$G = \\frac{(\\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a})^2}{E} = \\frac{\\sigma^2 \\pi a}{E}$$\nThe onset of fracture occurs when the applied stress reaches a critical value, $\\sigma_c$, at which point the energy release rate $G$ reaches the critical value $G_c = \\gamma$. We can therefore write the critical condition as:\n$$G_c = \\frac{\\sigma_c^2 \\pi a}{E}$$\nWe are given $G_c = \\gamma = 1\\,\\mathrm{J/m^2}$. Rearranging the equation to solve for the critical stress $\\sigma_c$:\n$$\\sigma_c^2 = \\frac{E G_c}{\\pi a}$$\n$$\\sigma_c = \\sqrt{\\frac{E G_c}{\\pi a}}$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values provided in the problem statement into this expression.

The condition $r_p \\ll a$ validates the use of LEFM, as it implies that the plastic deformation is confined to a small region well within the elastic stress concentration field of the pore. This is the definition of small-scale yielding. Consequently, the material response near the pore is characterized as locally brittle-like. Fracture is likely to initiate when $K_I$ reaches the material's fracture toughness, $K_{Ic}$, without being preceded by large-scale plastic deformation that would blunt the crack. If the ratio were of order unity or larger, widespread plasticity would dominate, and an elastic-plastic fracture mechanics (EPFM) framework would be necessary for an accurate analysis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.127}$$", "id": "2536613"}]}
