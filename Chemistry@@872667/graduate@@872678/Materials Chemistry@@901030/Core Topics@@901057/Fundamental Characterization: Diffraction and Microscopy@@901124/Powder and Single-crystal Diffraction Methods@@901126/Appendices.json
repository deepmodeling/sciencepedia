It is based on fundamental principles and presents a complete set of idealized data, which is appropriate for a pedagogical context. The problem is therefore deemed **valid**, and a solution will be constructed.\n\nThe general procedure for indexing a powder diffraction pattern from a material of unknown structure, especially one with high crystal symmetry as is often assumed in such problems, follows a sequence of logical steps. While modern algorithms are highly sophisticated and often employ exhaustive search strategies, the core logic is based on the principles outlined below.\n\nFirst, the measured interplanar spacings $d_{hkl}$, which are in real space, must be converted to a reciprocal space quantity. This is because the relationship between reflections is simpler in reciprocal space. Bragg's law, $2 d \\sin \\theta = \\lambda$, can be squared and rearranged. Using the definition of the magnitude of the reciprocal lattice vector, $Q_{hkl} = 1/d_{hkl} = (2 \\sin \\theta)/\\lambda$, we obtain a quantity $Q_{hkl}^2 = 1/d_{hkl}^2$. The expression for $Q_{hkl}^2$ is a quadratic form in the Miller indices $(h, k, l)$ and the reciprocal lattice parameters. For the general triclinic case, this is $Q_{hkl}^2 = h^2 a^{*2} + k^2 b^{*2} + l^2 c^{*2} + 2hk a^* b^* \\cos \\gamma^* + 2hl a^* c^* \\cos \\beta^* + 2kl b^* c^* \\cos \\alpha^*$. For higher symmetry systems, this equation simplifies significantly. For a cubic system, it becomes $Q_{hkl}^2 = (h^2+k^2+l^2)/a^2$, where $a$ is the lattice parameter.\n\nSecond, one attempts to discriminate among Bravais lattices. This is achieved by searching for simple rational relationships between the observed $Q_i^2$ values. For a cubic lattice, the ratios of $Q_i^2$ values must be ratios of integers, where these integers are sums of three squares, $N = h^2+k^2+l^2$. Furthermore, systematic absences in the set of observed reflections impose constraints on the allowed $(hkl)$ indices, which are characteristic of the Bravais lattice type. For a primitive cubic (P) lattice, all integer values of $N$ that can be written as the sum of three squares are allowed (e.g., $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, ...$; $7, 15, 23, 28, ...$ are forbidden). For a body-centered cubic (I) lattice, the reflection condition is $h+k+l = 2n$ (even), which means $h^2+k^2+l^2$ must be an even integer (e.g., $N = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...$). For a face-centered cubic (F) lattice, the indices must be all even or all odd, leading to an allowed sequence of $N = 3, 4, 8, 11, 12, 16, ...$. By identifying the sequence of multipliers that relates the observed $Q_i^2$ values, one can deduce the crystal system and Bravais lattice.\n\nThird, a candidate unit cell is proposed. For a cubic system, once the Bravais lattice is identified, any single reflection can be used to propose a trial lattice parameter. For example, if the first peak is indexed as $(h_1k_1l_1)$, then $a^2 = (h_1^2+k_1^2+l_1^2)/Q_1^2$.\n\nFourth, the proposed unit cell must be verified by consistently assigning Miller indices to all observed peaks. The calculated $Q_{calc}^2$ values for the indexed peaks must match the observed $Q_{obs}^2$ values within the experimental uncertainty. For a successful indexing, all observed lines must be accounted for without any un-indexed lines at low angle, and the indices must satisfy the systematic absence rules for the proposed Bravais lattice.\n\nFifth, once a valid indexing solution is found, the lattice parameter(s) are refined using a least-squares method. This procedure minimizes the sum of the weighted squared differences between the observed and calculated peak positions. For a cubic system with model $Q_i^2 = N_i/a^2$, and a parameter to fit $P = 1/a^2$, the function to minimize is $\\chi^2 = \\sum_i w_i (Q_{i,obs}^2 - N_i P)^2$, where $w_i$ are statistical weights, typically related to the inverse square of the uncertainty of each observation.\n\nApplying this procedure to the provided data:\n\nStep 1: The twenty given $d$-spacings are converted to $Q_i^2 = 1/d_i^2$ values (in units of Å$^{-2}$).\n$Q_1^2 = 1/(2.121320)^2 = 0.22222223$\n$Q_2^2 = 1/(1.500000)^2 = 0.44444444$\n$Q_3^2 = 1/(1.224745)^2 = 0.66666667$\n$Q_4^2 = 1/(1.060660)^2 = 0.88888889$\nand so on.\n\nStep 2: We examine the ratios of these $Q^2$ values. Let $S = Q_1^2 = 0.22222223$.\n$Q_2^2/S = 2.0000000$\n$Q_3^2/S = 3.0000000$\n$Q_4^2/S = 4.0000000$\nThis suggests that the $Q^2$ values might be integer multiples of some fundamental value. Let's find this fundamental value by dividing each $Q_i^2$ by small integers until a consistent constant emerges. We observe that $Q_1^2/2 = 0.11111111$, $Q_2^2/4 = 0.11111111$, $Q_3^2/6 = 0.11111111$, etc. A common factor $C_0 = 1/9 \\approx 0.11111111$ Å$^{-2}$ is evident. The observed $Q_i^2$ values are thus $Q_i^2 = N_i \\cdot C_0$, where the sequence of integers $N_i$ is:\n$N_1 = 2$, $N_2 = 4$, $N_3 = 6$, $N_4 = 8$, $N_5 = 10$, $N_6 = 12$, $N_7 = 14$, $N_8 = 16$, $N_9 = 18$, $N_{10} = 20$, $N_{11} = 22$, $N_{12} = 24$, $N_{13} = 26$.\nContinuing for all 20 peaks, we find the sequence of $N$ values to be: $2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42$.\nThis sequence consists of all even numbers from $2$ to $26$, skips $28$, and continues from $30$. The integer $28$ cannot be written as the sum of three integer squares. This sequence is the unique signature of a body-centered cubic (BCC or I) lattice.\n\nStep 3: The crystal system is cubic and the Bravais lattice is body-centered. The relation for $Q^2$ is an special case: $Q_{hkl}^2 = (h^2+k^2+l^2)/a^2$. The constant factor we found is $C_0 = 1/a^2$. From our analysis, $C_0 \\approx 1/9$ Å$^{-2}$, which gives a trial lattice parameter $a = \\sqrt{9} = 3$ Å.\n\nStep 4: We assign Miller indices $(hkl)$ consistent with the BCC selection rule ($h+k+l = \\text{even}$) for each observed peak.\n- $d_1, N=2: (110)$\n- $d_2, N=4: (200)$\n- $d_3, N=6: (211)$\n- $d_4, N=8: (220)$\n- $d_5, N=10: (310)$\n- $d_6, N=12: (222)$\n- $d_7, N=14: (321)$\n- $d_8, N=16: (400)$\n- $d_9, N=18: (330)$ or $(411)$\n- $d_{10}, N=20: (420)$\n- $d_{11}, N=22: (332)$\n- $d_{12}, N=24: (422)$\n- $d_{13}, N=26: (510)$ or $(431)$\n- $d_{14}, N=30: (521)$\n- $d_{15}, N=32: (440)$\n- $d_{16}, N=34: (530)$ or $(433)$\n- $d_{17}, N=36: (600)$ or $(442)$\n- $d_{18}, N=38: (611)$ or $(532)$\n- $d_{19}, N=40: (620)$\n- $d_{20}, N=42: (541)$\nAll twenty peaks are indexed, and the pattern is perfectly consistent with a BCC lattice.\n\nStep 5: A least-squares refinement is performed to obtain the best value for the lattice parameter $a$. The model is $Q_i^2 = P \\cdot N_i$ where $P = 1/a^2$. A statistically sound approach involves weighting each data point by the inverse of its variance. The uncertainty in $Q^2$ is $\\delta(Q_i^2) = 2 Q_i^2 (\\delta d_i/d_i)$. Since $\\delta d/d$ is constant, the standard deviation $\\sigma_i$ for $Q_i^2$ is proportional to $Q_i^2$. The weight is $w_i = 1/\\sigma_i^2 \\propto 1/(Q_i^2)^2$. Using $Q_i^2 \\approx P N_i$, the weights are $w_i \\propto 1/N_i^2$. The weighted least-squares solution for the slope $P$ of a line passing through the origin is $P = (\\sum w_i N_i Q_i^2) / (\\sum w_i N_i^2)$. Substituting $w_i = 1/N_i^2$ simplifies this to $P = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\frac{Q_i^2}{N_i}$, where $n = 20$.\nWe compute the value of $Q_i^2/N_i = 1/(d_i^2 N_i)$ for each peak:\n$1/(2.121320^2 \\times 2) = 0.111111115$\n$1/(1.500000^2 \\times 4) = 0.111111111$\n...\n$1/(0.4629100^2 \\times 42) = 0.111111111$\nThe individual values are all extremely close to $1/9$.

Your final answer must list the four values in the order $\\left(R_p,\\,R_{wp},\\,R_{\\exp},\\,\\chi^2\\right)$.", "solution": "The problem as stated is scientifically grounded, well-posed, objective, and self-contained. It is a standard application of statistical analysis in the context of Rietveld refinement, a core technique in materials chemistry. The provided data are sufficient and consistent for the derivation and calculation of the requested quantities. The problem is therefore valid and will be solved.\n\nThe fundamental principle of a weighted least-squares refinement is the minimization of the sum of squared weighted residuals, $S$. This quantity is defined as:\n$$S = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i (y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}} - y_i^{\\mathrm{calc}})^2$$\nHere, $N$ is the number of data points, $y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}}$ is the observed intensity at point $i$, $y_i^{\\mathrm{calc}}$ is the calculated intensity from the model at point $i$, and $w_i$ is the weight assigned to that point. The problem states that the weights are given by $w_i = 1/\\sigma_i^2$, where $\\sigma_i^2$ is the variance of the observed count. For a counting experiment governed by Poisson statistics, the variance of a count is equal to its expectation value. In practice, the observed count $y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}}$ is used as the best estimate of its own variance, so we set $\\sigma_i^2 = y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}}$. The weights are therefore $w_i = 1/y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}}$. Substituting this into the expression for $S$ gives:\n$$S = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{(y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}} - y_i^{\\mathrm{calc}})^2}{y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}}}$$\n\nThe four requested quantities are derived as follows:\n\n1.  **Unweighted Profile Residual ($R_p$)**: This is an unweighted measure of the average fractional error, defined as the sum of the absolute differences between observed and calculated data, normalized by the sum of the observed data.\n    $$R_p = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} |y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}} - y_i^{\\mathrm{calc}}|}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}}}$$\n\n2.  **Weighted Profile Residual ($R_{wp}$)**: This is the statistically most significant residual, as it is directly related to the quantity $S$ that is minimized. It is defined as:\n    $$R_{wp} = \\left[ \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i (y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}} - y_i^{\\mathrm{calc}})^2}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i (y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}})^2} \\right]^{1/2}$$\n    Substituting $w_i = 1/y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}}$, the expression becomes:\n    $$R_{wp} = \\left[ \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{(y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}} - y_i^{\\mathrm{calc}})^2}{y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}}}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{(y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}})^2}{y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}}}} \\right]^{1/2} = \\left[ \\frac{S}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}}} \\right]^{1/2}$$\n\n3.  **Expected Residual ($R_{\\exp}$)**: This represents the theoretical minimum value for $R_{wp}$ that one could expect if the model were perfect and the only discrepancies were due to counting statistics. The statistical expectation value for the minimized sum of squares is the number of degrees of freedom, which is the number of observations $N$ minus the number of refined parameters $P$.\n    $$E[S] = E\\left[\\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i (y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}} - y_i^{\\mathrm{calc}})^2\\right] = N - P$$\n    Replacing the numerator in the $R_{wp}$ formula with its expected value gives $R_{\\exp}$:\n    $$R_{\\exp} = \\left[ \\frac{N - P}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i (y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}})^2} \\right]^{1/2} = \\left[ \\frac{N - P}{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}}} \\right]^{1/2}$$\n\n4.  **Goodness-of-Fit ($\\chi^2$)**: The goodness-of-fit, or chi-squared, is the ratio of the minimized sum of squares $S$ to its expected value, $N - P$. It serves as a measure of how well the model accounts for the statistical noise in the data.\n    $$\\chi^2 = \\frac{S}{N - P} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} w_i (y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}} - y_i^{\\mathrm{calc}})^2}{N - P} = \\left(\\frac{R_{wp}}{R_{\\exp}}\\right)^2$$\n    A value of $\\chi^2 \\approx 1$ indicates that the fit is statistically sound.\n\nNow, we compute these values for the given data. We are given $N=10$ and $P=4$.\nFirst, we calculate the necessary sums from the provided data pairs $(y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}},\\,y_i^{\\mathrm{calc}})$:\n\n-   Sum of observed intensities:\n    $$\\sum_{i=1}^{10} y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}} = 120 + 200 + 350 + 500 + 800 + 650 + 400 + 300 + 180 + 100 = 3600$$\n\n-   Sum of absolute differences:\n    $$\\sum_{i=1}^{10} |y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}} - y_i^{\\mathrm{calc}}| = |120-116| + |200-210| + \\dots + |100-96|$$\n    $$= 4 + 10 + 17 + 21 + 20 + 20 + 22 + 11 + 10 + 4 = 139$$\n\n-   Minimized sum of squared weighted residuals, $S$:\n    $$S = \\sum_{i=1}^{10} \\frac{(y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}} - y_i^{\\mathrm{calc}})^2}{y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}}} = \\frac{4^2}{120} + \\frac{(-10)^2}{200} + \\frac{17^2}{350} + \\frac{(-21)^2}{500} + \\frac{20^2}{800} + \\frac{20^2}{650} + \\frac{(-22)^2}{400} + \\frac{11^2}{300} + \\frac{(-10)^2}{180} + \\frac{4^2}{100}$$\n    $$S \\approx 0.133333 + 0.500000 + 0.825714 + 0.882000 + 0.500000 + 0.615385 + 1.210000 + 0.403333 + 0.555556 + 0.160000 \\approx 5.785321$$\n\nUsing these sums, we calculate the four indicators, rounding each to four significant figures as required:\n\n-   $R_p = \\frac{139}{3600} \\approx 0.0386111 \\approx 0.03861$\n\n-   $R_{wp} = \\left[ \\frac{5.785321}{3600} \\right]^{1/2} = \\left[ 0.00160703 \\right]^{1/2} \\approx 0.0400878 \\approx 0.04009$\n\n-   $R_{\\exp} = \\left[ \\frac{10-4}{3600} \\right]^{1/2} = \\left[ \\frac{6}{3600} \\right]^{1/2} = \\left[ \\frac{1}{600} \\right]^{1/2} \\approx 0.0408248 \\approx 0.04082$\n\n-   $\\chi^2 = \\frac{5.785321}{10-4} = \\frac{5.785321}{6} \\approx 0.964220 \\approx 0.9642$\n\nFinally, we must assess the quality of the fit. The conventional criterion for a successful refinement is that the model sufficiently explains the data when the goodness-of-fit $\\chi^2$ is close to unity. Our calculated value is $\\chi^2 \\approx 0.9642$, which is indeed very close to $1$. This indicates that the magnitude of the residuals $(y_i^{\\mathrm{obs}} - y_i^{\\mathrm{calc}})$ is consistent with what would be expected from random Poisson counting statistics alone. Therefore, the model is considered to provide a sufficient explanation for the experimental noise in this data window.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix} 0.03861 & 0.04009 & 0.04082 & 0.9642 \\end{pmatrix}}\n$$", "id": "2515463"}]}
