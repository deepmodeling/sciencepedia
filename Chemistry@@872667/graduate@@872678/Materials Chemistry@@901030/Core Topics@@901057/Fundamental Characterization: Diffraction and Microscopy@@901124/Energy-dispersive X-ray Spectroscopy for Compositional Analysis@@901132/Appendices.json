A solution will now be derived.\n\n**Derivation of the True Input Rate**\n\nLet us consider a total measurement time $T$, which is the \"real time\". During this period, the total number of events recorded by the detector is $N_{\\mathrm{out}}$. By definition, the measured output rate is $R_{\\mathrm{out}} = \\frac{N_{\\mathrm{out}}}{T}$.\n\nFor a nonparalyzable detector, each of the $N_{\\mathrm{out}}$ recorded events renders the detector insensitive (or \"dead\") for a fixed duration $\\tau$. Therefore, the total time during which the detector was dead is the product of the number of recorded events and the dead time per event:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{dead}} = N_{\\mathrm{out}} \\tau = (R_{\\mathrm{out}} T) \\tau\n$$\nThe detector is only able to register new events when it is \"live\". The total live time, $T_{\\mathrm{live}}$, is the total real time minus the total dead time:\n$$\nT_{\\mathrm{live}} = T - T_{\\mathrm{dead}} = T - R_{\\mathrm{out}} T \\tau = T(1 - R_{\\mathrm{out}} \\tau)\n$$\nThe fundamental characteristic of a nonparalyzable model is that all recorded events, $N_{\\mathrm{out}}$, must have occurred during the live time $T_{\\mathrm{live}}$. Since the incident events arrive as a stationary Poisson process with a true rate of $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$, the number of events that arrive and are successfully recorded during the live time is given by:\n$$\nN_{\\mathrm{out}} = R_{\\mathrm{in}} T_{\\mathrm{live}}\n$$\nWe can now substitute the expressions for $N_{\\mathrm{out}}$ and $T_{\\mathrm{live}}$:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{out}} T = R_{\\mathrm{in}} [T(1 - R_{\\mathrm{out}} \\tau)]\n$$\nThe total time $T$ is a non-zero quantity and can be canceled from both sides, yielding the relationship between the rates:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{out}} = R_{\\mathrm{in}} (1 - R_{\\mathrm{out}} \\tau)\n$$\nThe problem requires an explicit expression for the true input rate, $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$. We rearrange the equation to solve for $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{out}}}{1 - R_{\\mathrm{out}} \\tau}\n$$\nThis is the dead-time correction formula for a nonparalyzable detector. The term $R_{\\mathrm{out}} \\tau$ represents the fraction of time the detector is busy, also known as the dead time fraction. For a physically meaningful solution, this fraction must be less than $1$, i.e., $R_{\\mathrm{out}} \\tau < 1$.\n\n**Numerical Calculation**\n\nWe are given the following values:\n- Measured output rate: $R_{\\mathrm{out}} = 50\\,\\mathrm{kcps} = 50 \\times 10^3\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} = 5 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.\n- Detector dead time: $\\tau = 1\\,\\mu\\mathrm{s} = 1 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}$.\n\nFirst, we compute the dimensionless dead time fraction, $R_{\\mathrm{out}} \\tau$:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{out}} \\tau = (5 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}) \\times (1 \\times 10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{s}) = 5 \\times 10^{-2} = 0.05\n$$\nSince $0.05 < 1$, the measurement is not fully saturated and a corrected rate can be computed.\n\nNow, we substitute this value into the derived formula for $R_{\\mathrm{in}}$:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\frac{R_{\\mathrm{out}}}{1 - 0.05} = \\frac{5 \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}}{0.95}\n$$\nPerforming the division:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\frac{5}{0.95} \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1} \\approx 5.26315789... \\times 10^4\\,\\mathrm{s}^{-1}\n$$\nThe problem requires the answer to be expressed in kilo-counts per second (kcps) and rounded to four significant figures.\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{in}} \\approx 52.6315789...\\,\\mathrm{kcps}\n$$\nRounding to four significant figures, we get:\n$$\nR_{\\mathrm{in}} \\approx 52.63\\,\\mathrm{kcps}\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{52.63}$$", "id": "2486240"}, {"introduction": "Once you have an accurate measure of the X-rays reaching the detector, the next step is to account for those that never made it out of the sample.

These two fundamental parameters alone account for $(100+100)/264 \\approx 76\\,\\%$ of the total variance.\n\n**Comparison and Conclusion**\nComparing the total uncertainties:\n- Case 1: $\\sigma_{rel, 1} \\approx 12.49\\,\\%$\n- Case 2: $\\sigma_{rel, 2} \\approx 4.90\\,\\%$\n- Case 3: $\\sigma_{rel, 3} \\approx 16.25\\,\\%$\n\nCase $3$ exhibits the largest expected systematic discrepancy (total uncertainty) for standardless quantification. The dominant sources are the uncertainties in the fundamental parameters related to the generation of $L$-shell X-rays from tungsten ($\\mathrm{W}$), specifically the ionization cross-section and Coster–Kronig transition yields.\n\n**Evaluation of Options**\n\n*   **A. Case $1$ ($\\mathrm{Al}\\text{–}5\\,\\%\\,\\mathrm{Mg}$ at $10\\,\\mathrm{keV}$), dominated by detector window transmission and mass absorption coefficients at $1\\text{–}2\\,\\mathrm{keV}$.**\n    The total uncertainty for Case $1$ is $\\approx 12.49\\,\\%$, which is less than that of Case $3$ ($\\approx 16.25\\,\\%$). While the dominant uncertainty sources for Case $1$ are correctly identified (detector efficiency at low energy is dominated by window absorption), the premise that Case $1$ has the largest overall discrepancy is false.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **B. Case $2$ ($\\mathrm{Fe}\\text{–}20\\,\\%\\,\\mathrm{Ni}$ at $15\\,\\mathrm{keV}$), dominated by backscatter correction at $6\\text{–}8\\,\\mathrm{keV}$.**\n    Case $2$ has the smallest total uncertainty ($\\approx 4.90\\,\\%$). The claim that it has the largest is incorrect. Furthermore, the dominant uncertainty source is the ionization cross-section ($3\\,\\%$), not the electron transport/backscatter correction ($2\\,\\%$).\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n*   **C. Case $3$ ($\\mathrm{Ni}\\text{–}10\\,\\%\\,\\mathrm{W}$ at $15\\,\\mathrm{keV}$), dominated by $L$-subshell fundamental parameters (ionization cross-sections, fluorescence yields, and Coster–Kronig yields) for $\\mathrm{W}$.**\n    Our analysis shows that Case $3$ has the largest total uncertainty ($\\approx 16.25\\,\\%$). The dominant sources are indeed the $L$-subshell fundamental parameters: ionization cross-section ($10\\,\\%$) and Coster-Kronig yields ($10\\,\\%$) are the largest contributors, with fluorescence yield ($5\\,\\%$) also being significant. The sum of squares of these three parameters ($10^2+5^2+10^2=225$) vastly outweighs the sum of squares of all other parameters ($3^2+2^2+1^2+4^2+3^2=39$). This statement is in complete agreement with our derivation.\n    **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n*   **D. Case $1$ ($\\mathrm{Al}\\text{–}5\\,\\%\\,\\mathrm{Mg}$ at $10\\,\\mathrm{keV}$), dominated by severe peak overlap of $\\mathrm{Al}\\,K\\alpha$ and $\\mathrm{Mg}\\,K\\alpha$.**\n    As established for option A, Case $1$ does not have the largest uncertainty. Moreover, the uncertainty from peak deconvolution is given as $2\\,\\%$, which is a minor contributor compared to detector efficiency ($8\\,\\%$) and mass absorption ($7\\,\\%$). The claim of dominance is false.\n    **Verdict: Incorrect.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2486261"}]}
