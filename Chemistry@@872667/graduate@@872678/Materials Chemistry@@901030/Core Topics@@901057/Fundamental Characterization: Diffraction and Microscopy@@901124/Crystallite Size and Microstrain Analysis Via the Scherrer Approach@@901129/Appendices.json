It presents a standard, albeit simplified, scenario in X-ray diffraction analysis of nanomaterials, which is perfectly formalizable. All provided data are physically realistic and consistent. We may therefore proceed with the derivation and solution.\n\nThe fundamental relationship governing the broadening of diffraction peaks due to finite crystallite size is the Scherrer equation. For a peak at a Bragg angle $\\theta$, the average crystallite dimension $D$ is related to the peak breadth $\\beta_{\\text{size}}$ by:\n$$D = \\frac{K \\lambda}{\\beta_{\\text{size}} \\cos(\\theta)}$$\nHere, $K$ is the dimensionless shape factor, $\\lambda$ is the X-ray wavelength, and $\\beta_{\\text{size}}$ is the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the peak contribution from crystallite size, expressed in radians.\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio between the apparent crystallite size calculated with the uncorrected, observed FWHM, $D_{\\text{uncorr}}$, and the size calculated after proper correction for instrumental broadening, $D_{\\text{corr}}$.\n\nFirst, we define the uncorrected crystallite size, $D_{\\text{uncorr}}$. This is a naive calculation that incorrectly assumes the entire observed peak breadth, $\\beta_{\\text{obs}}$, is due to the crystallite size effect. Using the Scherrer equation with the given peak position $\\theta_{0}$:\n$$D_{\\text{uncorr}} = \\frac{K \\lambda}{\\beta_{\\text{obs}} \\cos(\\theta_{0})}$$\nHere, $\\beta_{\\text{obs}}$ must be converted to radians for the formula to be numerically correct, but we will see that the conversion factor cancels in the final ratio.\n\nNext, we define the corrected crystallite size, $D_{\\text{corr}}$. This requires isolating the true physical broadening due to crystallite size, $\\beta_{\\text{size}}$, from the observed broadening, $\\beta_{\\text{obs}}$. The observed profile is a convolution of the instrumental profile and the sample's intrinsic profile. The problem states that the crystallite size contribution is Gaussian, the instrumental contribution is Gaussian, and hence the observed profile is also Gaussian.\n\nA core principle provided is that the convolution of independent Gaussian functions yields a Gaussian whose variance is the sum of the individual variances. For a Gaussian distribution, the square of the FWHM is directly proportional to the variance ($\\beta^2 = c \\sigma^2$, where $c = 8\\ln(2)$). Therefore, the FWHMs of the convolved profiles are related by the sum of their squares:\n$$\\beta_{\\text{obs}}^2 = \\beta_{\\text{size}}^2 + \\beta_{\\text{inst}}^2$$\nThe problem specifies that microstrain is negligible, so the sample broadening is entirely due to crystallite size. From this relation, we solve for the true size-related broadening, $\\beta_{\\text{size}}$:\n$$\\beta_{\\text{size}} = \\sqrt{\\beta_{\\text{obs}}^2 - \\beta_{\\text{inst}}^2}$$\nNote that this relationship holds regardless of whether the breadths are measured in degrees or radians, as long as the units are consistent across all terms. The resulting $\\beta_{\\text{size}}$ will have the same units as $\\beta_{\\text{obs}}$ and $\\beta_{\\text{inst}}$.\n\nThe corrected crystallite size, $D_{\\text{corr}}$, is then given by the Scherrer equation using this corrected breadth:\n$$D_{\\text{corr}} = \\frac{K \\lambda}{\\beta_{\\text{size}} \\cos(\\theta_{0})}$$\n\nWe are tasked with deriving the ratio $R = D_{\\text{uncorr}} / D_{\\text{corr}}$.

The problem is **valid**. We proceed to the solution.\n\n### Derivation from First Principles\nThe total broadening of a diffraction peak is a convolution of contributions from the instrument, finite crystallite size, and microstrain. We must first isolate the sample's intrinsic broadening, $\\beta_{\\text{sample}}$, from the measured broadening, $\\beta_{\\text{meas}}$. Assuming Gaussian profiles, this deconvolution is performed in quadrature:\n$$ \\beta_{\\text{sample}}^2 = \\beta_{\\text{meas}}^2 - \\beta_{\\text{inst}}^2 $$\nThe physical origin of the sample broadening determines its dependence on the diffraction angle, $\\theta$. We must analyze the two primary contributions: finite crystallite size and microstrain.\n\n**1. Crystallite Size Broadening**\nFinite crystallite size, $L$, leads to a broadening described by the Scherrer equation. This can be derived from the uncertainty principle in Fourier space. The width of a diffraction peak in reciprocal space, $\\Delta q$, is inversely proportional to the size of the coherently scattering domain, $L$: $\\Delta q \\propto 1/L$. The scattering vector magnitude is $q = (4\\pi/\\lambda)\\sin\\theta$. A small deviation in scattering angle, $d\\theta$, corresponds to a deviation in $q$ given by $dq = (4\\pi/\\lambda)\\cos\\theta \\, d\\theta$. The FWHM in $2\\theta$, denoted $\\beta_{2\\theta}$, is $2d\\theta$. The peak width in $q$-space is thus $\\beta_q \\approx (2\\pi/\\lambda)\\cos\\theta \\, \\beta_{2\\theta, \\text{size}}$.\nRelating this to the crystallite size via the Scherrer constant $K$:\n$$ \\beta_q = \\frac{2\\pi K}{L} \\approx \\frac{2\\pi \\cos\\theta}{\\lambda} \\beta_{2\\theta, \\text{size}} $$\nSolving for the broadening due to size, $\\beta_{\\text{size}}$ (where we use this notation for $\\beta_{2\\theta, \\text{size}}$), gives the Scherrer equation:\n$$ \\beta_{\\text{size}} = \\frac{K\\lambda}{L\\cos\\theta} $$\nHere, $\\beta_{\\text{size}}$ must be in radians. The critical functional dependence for pure size broadening is:\n$$ \\beta_{\\text{size}} \\propto \\frac{1}{\\cos\\theta} $$\n\n**2. Microstrain Broadening**\nMicrostrain, $\\epsilon = \\Delta d/d$, describes a distribution of interplanar spacings $d$ around a mean value. Its effect on peak width is found by differentiating Bragg's Law, $2d\\sin\\theta = n\\lambda$. For first order ($n=1$):\n$$ 2 \\Delta d \\sin\\theta + 2d \\cos\\theta \\Delta\\theta = 0 $$\nRearranging gives the relation between a change in $d$-spacing and a change in $\\theta$:\n$$ \\frac{\\Delta d}{d} = -\\cot\\theta \\, \\Delta\\theta $$\nThe broadening in $2\\theta$, $\\beta_{\\text{strain}}$, is proportional to $2|\\Delta\\theta|$. The microstrain $\\epsilon$ is a measure of the width of the distribution of $\\Delta d/d$. Thus, the broadening due to strain is:\n$$ \\beta_{\\text{strain}} \\propto |\\cot\\theta|^{-1} = \\tan\\theta $$\nA common formulation is $\\beta_{\\text{strain}} = C \\epsilon \\tan\\theta$, where $C$ is a constant (often taken as $4$) and $\\beta_{\\text{strain}}$ is in radians. The critical functional dependence for pure microstrain broadening is:\n$$ \\beta_{\\text{strain}} \\propto \\tan\\theta $$\n\n### Data Analysis\nWe now calculate the intrinsic sample broadening, $\\beta_{\\text{sample}}$, for each reflection using the provided data and $\\beta_{\\text{inst}} = 0.10^\\circ$.\n$$ \\beta_{\\text{sample}} = \\sqrt{\\beta_{\\text{meas}}^2 - (0.10^\\circ)^2} $$\n\n-   **Peak (111)**: $2\\theta = 30.0^\\circ \\implies \\theta = 15.0^\\circ$.\n    $\\beta_{\\text{sample}} = \\sqrt{(0.35^\\circ)^2 - (0.10^\\circ)^2} = \\sqrt{0.1225 - 0.01} = \\sqrt{0.1125} \\approx 0.3354^\\circ$.\n-   **Peak (200)**: $2\\theta = 35.0^\\circ \\implies \\theta = 17.5^\\circ$.\n    $\\beta_{\\text{sample}} = \\sqrt{(0.38^\\circ)^2 - (0.10^\\circ)^2} = \\sqrt{0.1444 - 0.01} = \\sqrt{0.1344} \\approx 0.3666^\\circ$.\n-   **Peak (220)**: $2\\theta = 50.0^\\circ \\implies \\theta = 25.0^\\circ$.\n    $\\beta_{\\text{sample}} = \\sqrt{(0.60^\\circ)^2 - (0.10^\\circ)^2} = \\sqrt{0.36 - 0.01} = \\sqrt{0.35} \\approx 0.5916^\\circ$.\n\nTo determine the dominant broadening mechanism, we test which proportionality holds. We check if $\\beta_{\\text{sample}} \\cos\\theta$ (size) or $\\beta_{\\text{sample}} / \\tan\\theta$ (strain) is constant across the reflections. The units of $\\beta_{\\text{sample}}$ (degrees) are acceptable for this ratio analysis.\n\n| Reflection | $\\theta$ ($^\\circ$) | $\\beta_{\\text{sample}}$ ($^\\circ$) | $\\beta_{\\text{sample}} \\cos\\theta$ | $\\beta_{\\text{sample}} / \\tan\\theta$ |\n|------------|-----------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| $(111)$    | $15.0$            | $0.3354$                    | $0.3241$                   | $1.252$                       |\n| $(200)$    | $17.5$            | $0.3666$                    | $0.3497$                   | $1.163$                       |\n| $(220)$    | $25.0$            | $0.5916$                    | $0.5361$                   | $1.269$                       |\n\nThe values for $\\beta_{\\text{sample}} \\cos\\theta$ ($0.3241$, $0.3497$, $0.5361$) are not constant; they show a strong increasing trend with $\\theta$. In contrast, the values for $\\beta_{\\text{sample}} / \\tan\\theta$ ($1.252$, $1.163$, $1.269$) are approximately constant, fluctuating around a mean of about $1.23$. The deviation from perfect constancy is expected with experimental data and simplifying assumptions. The data clearly support a $\\tan\\theta$ dependence.\n\n**Conclusion**: The dominant source of line broadening in this sample is microstrain.\n\n### Evaluation of Options\n\n**A.

Appropriate alternatives include Williamson–Hall (W–H) separation of size and microstrain contributions and Warren–Averbach (W–A) Fourier analysis of line profiles.**\n-   The premise that the ratio $\\beta_{\\text{sample}} / \\tan\\theta$ is approximately constant, indicating microstrain dominance, is correct as shown by our analysis.\n-   If one were to apply the Scherrer formula $L = K\\lambda / (\\beta \\cos\\theta)$ using the total sample broadening $\\beta = \\beta_{\\text{sample}}$ instead of the much smaller true size broadening component $\\beta_{\\text{size}}$, the large value of $\\beta$ in the denominator would lead to a calculated size $L$ that is significantly smaller than the true size. The underestimation would indeed be severe.\n-   The Williamson-Hall (W-H) and Warren-Averbach (W-A) methods are the canonical procedures for separating size and microstrain contributions from diffraction line profiles. They are the correct and standard alternatives in this situation.\n-   This statement is entirely consistent with our findings and established crystallographic practice.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. The approximately constant product of the deconvolved width and $\\cos\\theta$ indicates size-dominated broadening; a single-peak Scherrer estimate is reliable here, and no alternative analysis is needed.**\n-   The premise that the product $\\beta_{\\text{sample}} \\cos\\theta$ is constant is directly contradicted by our analysis of the provided data.\n-   Consequently, the broadening is not size-dominated, and a single-peak Scherrer estimate would be highly unreliable.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**C. Because instrument broadening is small, the least biased Scherrer size comes from the highest-angle peak; microstrain is negligible. A temperature-dependent Debye–Waller analysis is the most appropriate alternative if desired.**\n-   The claim that microstrain is negligible is false; it is the dominant contribution.\n-   The assertion that the highest-angle peak gives the \"least biased\" Scherrer size is incorrect. Since strain broadening ($\\propto \\tan\\theta$) increases more rapidly with angle than size broadening ($\\propto 1/\\cos\\theta$), the total broadening at higher angles is even more contaminated by the strain effect, making a Scherrer analysis at high angles *more* biased, not less.\n-   Debye-Waller analysis concerns the attenuation of peak *intensities* due to thermal vibration (atomic displacement parameters), not the analysis of peak *broadening* for size and strain. It is an entirely unrelated technique.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. The $hkl$-independent proportionality of width to $\\tan\\theta$ indicates stacking-fault-dominated broadening, so a Scherrer size is still valid if one restricts to reflections geometrically insensitive to faulting; the best alternative is pair distribution function (PDF) analysis to extract size only.**\n-   The proportionality of width to $\\tan\\theta$ is the signature of microstrain, not stacking faults. Broadening from stacking faults exhibits a complex dependence on the specific $hkl$ indices, leading to selective broadening and peak shifts, not a simple monotonic trend with $\\theta$.\n-   While pair distribution function (PDF) analysis is a powerful technique for studying nanomaterials, proposing it as the primary alternative based on a false premise (stacking faults) is illogical. The statement misdiagnoses the physical phenomenon.\n-   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**E. The broadening trend is consistent with microstrain dominance; instead of Scherrer, one should perform whole-pattern refinement with anisotropic microstrain models (for example, a Stephens tensor or a dislocation-based Wilkens parameterization) and complement with Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) to cross-validate crystallite size estimates.**\n-   The diagnosis of microstrain dominance is correct.\n-   The proposed alternative methods are advanced, appropriate, and represent best practices in modern materials characterization. While Williamson-Hall is a valid first approach, it assumes isotropic strain. Whole-pattern refinement using anisotropic microstrain models (e.g., as implemented in Rietveld software) provides a more physically realistic and detailed analysis.\n-   Complementing XRD analysis with a direct-space imaging technique like TEM for cross-validation is excellent scientific methodology, providing an independent measure of crystallite size and direct evidence of the defect structures (like dislocations) that cause microstrain.\n-   This statement presents a correct diagnosis and a sophisticated, valid path for further analysis.\n-   **Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{AE}$$", "id": "2478418"}, {"introduction": "The final numerical result for crystallite size depends critically on how \"peak breadth\" is defined, with Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) and integral breadth being the most common metrics.

Part (ii) requires the calculation of a ratio of relative uncertainties for two different crystallite size estimators, based on the results of Part (i) and given statistical data.\n\n**Part (i): Derivation of the Integral Breadth, $\\beta$**\n\nThe integral breadth $\\beta$ is defined as the total area under the peak profile, $S$, divided by the peak height, $I_0$.\n$$\n\\beta \\equiv \\frac{S}{I_0} = \\frac{1}{I_0} \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} I(x)\\,dx\n$$\nThe intensity profile $I(x)$ is given as a pseudo-Voigt function:\n$$\nI(x) = I_0 \\left[ \\eta\\,L(x; H) + (1-\\eta)\\,G(x; H) \\right]\n$$\nSubstituting this expression for $I(x)$ into the definition of $\\beta$:\n$$\n\\beta = \\frac{1}{I_0} \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} I_0 \\left[ \\eta\\,L(x; H) + (1-\\eta)\\,G(x; H) \\right]\\,dx\n$$\nThe peak height $I_0$ is a constant and can be cancelled out:\n$$\n\\beta = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\left[ \\eta\\,L(x; H) + (1-\\eta)\\,G(x; H) \\right]\\,dx\n$$\nBy the linearity of integration, we can separate this into two integrals:\n$$\n\\beta = \\eta \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} L(x; H)\\,dx + (1-\\eta) \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} G(x; H)\\,dx\n$$\nLet us denote the integral of the Lorentzian component as $S_L$ and the integral of the Gaussian component as $S_G$.\n$$\nS_L = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} L(x; H)\\,dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+4\\left(\\frac{x-x_0}{H}\\right)^{2}}\\,dx\n$$\n$$\nS_G = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} G(x; H)\\,dx = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\exp\\left[-4\\ln(2)\\left(\\frac{x-x_0}{H}\\right)^{2}\\right]\\,dx\n$$\nWe solve these integrals separately. For $S_L$, we perform a change of variables. Let $u = \\frac{2(x-x_0)}{H}$. This implies $du = \\frac{2}{H}\\,dx$, or $dx = \\frac{H}{2}\\,du$. The limits of integration remain $(-\\infty, +\\infty)$.\n$$\nS_L = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\frac{1}{1+u^2} \\left(\\frac{H}{2}\\right)\\,du = \\frac{H}{2} \\left[ \\arctan(u) \\right]_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} = \\frac{H}{2} \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{2} - \\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{H\\pi}{2}\n$$\nFor $S_G$, we recognize it as a standard Gaussian integral of the form $\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\exp(-ay^2)\\,dy = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{a}}$. First, let $y = x-x_0$, so $dy=dx$.\n$$\nS_G = \\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty} \\exp\\left[-\\left(\\frac{4\\ln(2)}{H^2}\\right)y^2\\right]\\,dy\n$$\nHere, the constant $a = \\frac{4\\ln(2)}{H^2}$. Applying the formula for the Gaussian integral:\n$$\nS_G = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{a}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi H^2}{4\\ln(2)}} = H \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{4\\ln(2)}}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the expressions for $S_L$ and $S_G$ back into the equation for $\\beta$:\n$$\n\\beta = \\eta S_L + (1-\\eta) S_G = \\eta \\left(\\frac{\\pi H}{2}\\right) + (1-\\eta) \\left(H \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{4\\ln(2)}}\\right)\n$$\nFactoring out the common FWHM, $H$, we arrive at the final closed-form expression for the integral breadth:\n$$\n\\beta = H \\left[ \\eta \\frac{\\pi}{2} + (1-\\eta) \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{4\\ln(2)}} \\right]\n$$\n\n**Part (ii): Calculation of the Ratio of Relative Uncertainties, $R$**\n\nThe problem asks for the ratio $R = \\frac{\\left(\\sigma_D/D\\right)_{\\text{FWHM}}}{\\left(\\sigma_D/D\\right)_{\\text{IB}}}$.\n\nFirst, we consider Estimator A, where the breadth is taken as the FWHM, $\\beta_F = H$. The Scherrer equation is $D = \\frac{K\\lambda}{\\beta\\cos\\theta}$. For Estimator A, this becomes $D_A = \\frac{K\\lambda}{H\\cos\\theta}$. Since $K$, $\\lambda$, and $\\theta$ are treated as exact constants, $D_A$ is a function of $H$ only. The relative uncertainty in $D_A$ is given by standard error propagation:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_D}{D}\\right)_{\\text{FWHM}} = \\left|\\frac{H}{D_A}\\frac{\\partial D_A}{\\partial H}\\right|\\frac{\\sigma_H}{H} = \\left|H \\frac{H\\cos\\theta}{K\\lambda} \\left(-\\frac{K\\lambda}{H^2\\cos\\theta}\\right)\\right|\\frac{\\sigma_H}{H} = |-1|\\frac{\\sigma_H}{H} = \\frac{\\sigma_H}{H}\n$$\nUsing the given values, $H = 0.120$ and $\\sigma_H = 0.015$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_D}{D}\\right)_{\\text{FWHM}} = \\frac{0.015}{0.120} = 0.125\n$$\nNext, we consider Estimator B, where the breadth is the integral breadth $\\beta = \\beta(H, \\eta)$ derived in Part (i). The crystallite size is $D_B = \\frac{K\\lambda}{\\beta\\cos\\theta}$. The relative uncertainty in $D_B$ is:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_D}{D}\\right)_{\\text{IB}} = \\frac{\\sigma_\\beta}{\\beta}\n$$\nWe must find the uncertainty $\\sigma_\\beta$ for the function $\\beta(H, \\eta)$ where $H$ and $\\eta$ are correlated variables. The general formula for linear uncertainty propagation is:\n$$\n\\sigma_\\beta^2 \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\partial\\beta}{\\partial H}\\right)^2 \\sigma_H^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\partial\\beta}{\\partial \\eta}\\right)^2 \\sigma_\\eta^2 + 2 \\left(\\frac{\\partial\\beta}{\\partial H}\\right) \\left(\\frac{\\partial\\beta}{\\partial \\eta}\\right) \\operatorname{cov}(H,\\eta)\n$$\nwhere $\\operatorname{cov}(H,\\eta) = \\rho\\,\\sigma_H\\,\\sigma_{\\eta}$. We calculate the partial derivatives of $\\beta(H, \\eta)$. For convenience, let $C_L = \\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and $C_G = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{4\\ln(2)}}$. Then $\\beta = H[\\eta C_L + (1-\\eta)C_G]$.\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\beta}{\\partial H} = \\eta C_L + (1-\\eta)C_G = \\frac{\\beta}{H}\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial\\beta}{\\partial \\eta} = H(C_L - C_G)\n$$\nSubstituting these into the expression for $\\sigma_\\beta^2$:\n$$\n\\sigma_\\beta^2 \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\beta}{H}\\right)^2 \\sigma_H^2 + \\left[H(C_L - C_G)\\right]^2 \\sigma_\\eta^2 + 2 \\left(\\frac{\\beta}{H}\\right) \\left[H(C_L - C_G)\\right] \\rho \\sigma_H \\sigma_\\eta\n$$\nTo find the relative uncertainty squared, $(\\sigma_\\beta/\\beta)^2$, we divide by $\\beta^2$:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_\\beta}{\\beta}\\right)^2 \\approx \\frac{1}{\\beta^2} \\left[ \\left(\\frac{\\beta}{H}\\right)^2 \\sigma_H^2 \\right] + \\frac{1}{\\beta^2} \\left[ H^2(C_L - C_G)^2 \\sigma_\\eta^2 \\right] + \\frac{1}{\\beta^2} \\left[ 2\\beta(C_L - C_G) \\rho \\sigma_H \\sigma_\\eta \\right]\n$$\nSimplifying the terms:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_\\beta}{\\beta}\\right)^2 \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_H}{H}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{H(C_L - C_G)}{\\beta}\\right)^2 \\sigma_\\eta^2 + 2 \\frac{H(C_L-C_G)}{\\beta} \\frac{\\rho \\sigma_H \\sigma_\\eta}{H}\n$$\nWe have $\\frac{H(C_L - C_G)}{\\beta} = \\frac{H(C_L - C_G)}{H[\\eta(C_L - C_G) + C_G]} = \\frac{C_L - C_G}{\\eta(C_L - C_G) + C_G}$. Let us call this term $K'$.\nThe expression for the relative uncertainty of the integral breadth becomes:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_\\beta}{\\beta}\\right)^2 \\approx \\left(\\frac{\\sigma_H}{H}\\right)^2 + (K')^2 \\sigma_\\eta^2 + 2 K' \\frac{\\rho \\sigma_H \\sigma_\\eta}{H}\n$$\nNow, we substitute the numerical values:\n$H = 0.120$, $\\eta = 0.35$, $\\sigma_H = 0.015$, $\\sigma_\\eta = 0.06$, $\\rho = -0.90$.\nThe constants are $C_L = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\approx 1.570796$ and $C_G = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\pi}{4\\ln(2)}} \\approx 1.064489$.\n$C_L - C_G \\approx 0.506307$.\nWe calculate $K'$:\n$$\nK' = \\frac{0.506307}{0.35 \\times 0.506307 + 1.064489} = \\frac{0.506307}{0.177207 + 1.064489} = \\frac{0.506307}{1.241696} \\approx 0.407756\n$$\nNow we compute the terms for $(\\sigma_\\beta/\\beta)^2$:\nTerm 1: $\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_H}{H}\\right)^2 = \\left(\\frac{0.015}{0.120}\\right)^2 = (0.125)^2 = 0.015625$.\nTerm 2: $(K')^2 \\sigma_\\eta^2 \\approx (0.407756)^2 \\times (0.06)^2 \\approx 0.166265 \\times 0.0036 \\approx 0.00059855$.\nTerm 3: $2 K' \\frac{\\rho \\sigma_H \\sigma_\\eta}{H} \\approx 2 \\times 0.407756 \\times \\frac{(-0.90) \\times 0.015 \\times 0.06}{0.120} = 0.815512 \\times \\frac{-0.00081}{0.120} = 0.815512 \\times (-0.00675) \\approx -0.0055047$.\nSumming the terms:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_\\beta}{\\beta}\\right)^2 \\approx 0.015625 + 0.00059855 - 0.0055047 = 0.01071885\n$$\nThe relative uncertainty for Estimator B is the square root of this value:\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{\\sigma_D}{D}\\right)_{\\text{IB}} = \\frac{\\sigma_\\beta}{\\beta} \\approx \\sqrt{0.01071885} \\approx 0.103532\n$$\nFinally, we compute the ratio $R$:\n$$\nR = \\frac{\\left(\\sigma_D/D\\right)_{\\text{FWHM}}}{\\left(\\sigma_D/D\\right)_{\\text{IB}}} = \\frac{0.125}{0.103532} \\approx 1.20735\n$$\nRounding the result to four significant figures as requested yields $1.207$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{1.207}$$", "id": "2478480"}]}
