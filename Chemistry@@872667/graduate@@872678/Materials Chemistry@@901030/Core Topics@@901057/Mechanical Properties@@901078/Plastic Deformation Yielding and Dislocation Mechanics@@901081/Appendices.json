A unique and stable solution exists for the yield stress.\n- **Objective**: The language is technical, precise, and free from subjective or opinion-based statements.\n- **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. The given values are physically plausible for a metallic single crystal. There are no internal contradictions.\n\nStep 3: Verdict and Action\nThe problem is deemed valid as it is scientifically sound, well-posed, objective, and self-consistent. The solution will now be derived.\n\nThe first task is to derive the expression for the resolved shear stress, $\\tau_R$. Let the uniaxial tensile stress be applied along a specific direction, which we define by the unit vector $\\mathbf{e}_L$. The magnitude of the applied stress is $\\sigma$. The Cauchy stress tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\sigma}$, which describes the state of stress in the material, can be written for this uniaxial case as the dyadic product of the loading direction vector with itself, scaled by the stress magnitude:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} = \\sigma (\\mathbf{e}_L \\otimes \\mathbf{e}_L) $$\nThe traction vector, $\\mathbf{t}$, on a plane with a unit normal vector $\\mathbf{n}$ is given by the Cauchy traction formula:\n$$ \\mathbf{t} = \\boldsymbol{\\sigma} \\cdot \\mathbf{n} $$\nIn this problem, the plane of interest is the slip plane. Substituting the expression for the stress tensor:\n$$ \\mathbf{t} = (\\sigma (\\mathbf{e}_L \\otimes \\mathbf{e}_L)) \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = \\sigma (\\mathbf{e}_L \\cdot \\mathbf{n}) \\mathbf{e}_L $$\nThe dot product $\\mathbf{e}_L \\cdot \\mathbf{n}$ represents the cosine of the angle between the loading axis and the slip plane normal. The problem defines this angle as $\\phi$. Therefore, $\\mathbf{e}_L \\cdot \\mathbf{n} = \\cos\\phi$. The traction vector on the slip plane is:\n$$ \\mathbf{t} = \\sigma \\cos\\phi \\, \\mathbf{e}_L $$\nThe resolved shear stress, $\\tau_R$, is the scalar component of this traction vector $\\mathbf{t}$ projected onto the slip direction, which is defined by the unit vector $\\mathbf{s}$. This projection is calculated by the dot product of $\\mathbf{t}$ and $\\mathbf{s}$:\n$$ \\tau_R = \\mathbf{t} \\cdot \\mathbf{s} $$\nSubstituting the expression for $\\mathbf{t}$:\n$$ \\tau_R = (\\sigma \\cos\\phi \\, \\mathbf{e}_L) \\cdot \\mathbf{s} = \\sigma \\cos\\phi \\, (\\mathbf{e}_L \\cdot \\mathbf{s}) $$\nThe dot product $\\mathbf{e}_L \\cdot \\mathbf{s}$ is the cosine of the angle between the loading axis and the slip direction. The problem defines this angle as $\\lambda$. Therefore, $\\mathbf{e}_L \\cdot \\mathbf{s} = \\cos\\lambda$.\nSubstituting this into the expression for $\\tau_R$ yields the final derived expression, known as Schmid's Law:\n$$ \\tau_R = \\sigma \\cos\\phi \\cos\\lambda $$\nThis completes the derivation.\n\nThe second task is to evaluate whether yielding occurs for an applied tensile stress of $\\sigma=150\\ \\text{MPa}$. The orientation factor is given as $m = \\cos\\phi \\cos\\lambda = 0.18$. The resolved shear stress can be calculated as:\n$$ \\tau_R = \\sigma m $$\nUsing the given values:\n$$ \\tau_R = (150\\ \\text{MPa}) \\times 0.18 = 27\\ \\text{MPa} $$\nYielding initiates when the resolved shear stress $\\tau_R$ reaches or exceeds the critical resolved shear stress $\\tau_c$. The given CRSS is $\\tau_c = 30\\ \\text{MPa}$.\nComparing the calculated resolved shear stress to the critical value:\n$$ \\tau_R = 27\\ \\text{MPa}  \\tau_c = 30\\ \\text{MPa} $$\nSince the resolved shear stress is less than the critical resolved shear stress, the crystal does not undergo plastic deformation. It remains in the elastic regime.\n\nThe final task is to determine the minimum uniaxial tensile stress, $\\sigma_y$, required to initiate yielding in this crystal orientation. Yielding occurs at the precise moment when the resolved shear stress equals the critical resolved shear stress:\n$$ \\tau_R = \\tau_c $$\nUsing the Schmid's Law relationship, $\\tau_R = \\sigma_y m$:\n$$ \\sigma_y m = \\tau_c $$\nSolving for the yield stress $\\sigma_y$:\n$$ \\sigma_y = \\frac{\\tau_c}{m} $$\nSubstituting the given numerical values, $\\tau_c = 30\\ \\text{MPa}$ and $m=0.18$:\n$$ \\sigma_y = \\frac{30\\ \\text{MPa}}{0.18} = \\frac{30}{18 \\times 10^{-2}} = \\frac{3000}{18}\\ \\text{MPa} = \\frac{500}{3}\\ \\text{MPa} \\approx 166.666... \\text{MPa} $$\nThe problem requires the answer to be rounded to three significant figures.\n$$ \\sigma_y \\approx 167\\ \\text{MPa} $$\nThis is the minimum tensile stress required to activate the slip system.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{167}\n$$", "id": "2511863"}, {"introduction": "Having established the stress condition for slip, we now turn to the carrier of plastic deformation: the dislocation.

Convert the computed $\\tau$ to megapascals via $\\tau[\\text{MPa}] = \\tau[\\text{Pa}]/10^6$. Numerical stability is trivial for the closed-form expressions; to guard against pathological input, one may enforce $\\rho_0 \\ge 0$ and hence $x_0 \\ge 0$.\n\nAlgorithmic steps for each test case:\n- Step $1$: Read $G$, $b$, $\\alpha$, $\\rho_0$, $k_1$, $k_2$, and plastic strain list $\\{\\varepsilon_p\\}$.\n- Step $2$: Convert units for $G$ and $b$ to $\\text{Pa}$ and $\\text{m}$, respectively. Compute $x_0 = \\sqrt{\\max(\\rho_0,0)}$, $A = \\dfrac{k_1}{b}$, and $B = k_2$.\n- Step $3$: For each $\\varepsilon_p$, compute $x(\\varepsilon_p)$ using the closed-form solution appropriate to $B > 0$ or $B = 0$.\n- Step $4$: Compute $\\tau(\\varepsilon_p) = \\alpha G b x(\\varepsilon_p)$, convert to $\\text{MPa}$, and round to three decimal places.\n- Step $5$: Aggregate the lists for all test cases and print a single line in the specified bracketed, comma-separated format.\n\nThe test suite spans: moderate storage with recovery (case $1$), the $k_2 = 0$ boundary with linear-in-strain $x(\\varepsilon_p)$ growth (case $2$), strong dynamic recovery leading to rapid saturation (case $3$), and a long strain path probing approach to saturation (case $4$). The outputs are deterministic real numbers, directly verifiable against the above closed-form expressions.", "answer": "```python\n# The complete and runnable Python 3 code goes here.\n# Imports must adhere to the specified execution environment.\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef taylor_shear_stress_MPa(G_GPa, b_nm, alpha, rho0, k1, k2, eps_list):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compute resolved shear flow stress tau(eps) in MPa using:\n      - Kocks-Mecking: d rho / d eps = (k1/b)*sqrt(rho) - k2*rho\n      - Taylor relation: tau = alpha * G * b * sqrt(rho)\n    Closed-form solution in terms of x = sqrt(rho):\n      If k2  0: x(eps) = A/B + (x0 - A/B) * exp(-B*eps/2)\n      If k2 = 0: x(eps) = x0 + (A/2) * eps\n    where A = k1 / b, B = k2, x0 = sqrt(rho0).\n    Units:\n      - G in GPa - Pa\n      - b in nm - m\n      - rho0 in 1/m^2\n      - tau output in MPa\n    \"\"\"\n    # Unit conversions\n    G = G_GPa * 1e9  # Pa\n    b = b_nm * 1e-9  # m\n\n    # Guard for non-negative initial density\n    rho0 = max(rho0, 0.0)\n    x0 = np.sqrt(rho0)\n\n    # Parameters A and B\n    A = k1 / b  # 1/m\n    B = k2      # dimensionless\n\n    # Pre-factor for stress conversion: alpha * G * b, in Pa per (1/m)\n    prefactor_Pa = alpha * G * b  # Pa\n    results = []\n    for eps in eps_list:\n        if B == 0.0:\n            x = x0 + 0.5 * A * eps\n        else:\n            x_ss = A / B\n            x = x_ss + (x0 - x_ss) * np.exp(-0.5 * B * eps)\n        # Ensure non-negative x due to any potential numerical artifact\n        x = max(x, 0.0)\n        tau_Pa = prefactor_Pa * x\n        tau_MPa = tau_Pa / 1e6\n        # Round to three decimal places\n        tau_MPa = round(float(tau_MPa), 3)\n        results.append(tau_MPa)\n    return results\n\ndef solve():\n    # Define the test cases from the problem statement.\n    # Each test case: (G_GPa, b_nm, alpha, rho0_m2, k1, k2, eps_list)\n    test_cases = [\n        (26.0, 0.286, 0.3, 1.0e12, 0.01, 0.2,  [0.0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.10]),\n        (26.0, 0.286, 0.3, 1.0e11, 0.005, 0.0, [0.0, 0.02, 0.10]),\n        (48.0, 0.256, 0.25, 5.0e13, 0.02, 1.0, [0.0, 0.005, 0.02, 0.05]),\n        (76.0, 0.249, 0.33, 1.0e8,  0.002, 0.5, [0.0, 0.50]),\n    ]\n\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        G_GPa, b_nm, alpha, rho0, k1, k2, eps_list = case\n        stresses_MPa = taylor_shear_stress_MPa(G_GPa, b_nm, alpha, rho0, k1, k2, eps_list)\n        results.append(stresses_MPa)\n\n    # Final print statement in the exact required format.\n    # Print a single line: a bracketed comma-separated list, inner lists similarly formatted.\n    # Ensure no extra spaces to maintain a compact representation.\n    def format_list(lst):\n        return \"[\" + \",\".join(map(str, lst)) + \"]\"\n    print(\"[\" + \",\".join(format_list(r) for r in results) + \"]\")\n\nsolve()\n```", "id": "2511865"}]}
