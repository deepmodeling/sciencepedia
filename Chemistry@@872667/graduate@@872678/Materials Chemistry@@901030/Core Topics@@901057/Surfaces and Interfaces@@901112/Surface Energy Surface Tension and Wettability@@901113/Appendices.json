The derivation must be based on first principles, including interfacial energies, the mechanical force balance at a three-phase contact line, and Young's equation.\n\nLet us begin by considering the forces acting at the three-phase contact line, where the solid, liquid, and vapor phases meet. The interfacial tensions are denoted as $\\gamma_{sl}$ for the solid-liquid interface, $\\gamma_{sv}$ for the solid-vapor interface, and $\\gamma$ for the liquid-vapor interface. These tensions give rise to forces per unit length acting on the contact line.\n\nConsider a straight contact line translated along the $x$-axis. The force per unit length exerted by the liquid-vapor interface on the contact line, parallel to the substrate, is $\\gamma \\cos\\theta$. The solid surface exerts a net force per unit length, $(\\gamma_{sv} - \\gamma_{sl})$, often called the adhesion tension. On an ideal, homogeneous surface, these forces balance, leading to Young's equation: $\\gamma \\cos\\theta_Y = \\gamma_{sv} - \\gamma_{sl}$.\n\nOn a chemically heterogeneous surface, the local adhesion tension, $(\\gamma_{sv}(x) - \\gamma_{sl}(x))$, varies with position.
