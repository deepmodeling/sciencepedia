The system is closed and isothermal, and a single-component gas fills the entire accessible gas volume. Assume the following physically realistic conditions:\n- The gas obeys the compressibility-factor form of the equation of state $P V = Z n R T$, where $P$ is pressure, $V$ is volume, $Z$ is the compressibility factor, $n$ is the amount of substance, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $T$ is temperature.\n- The temperature is uniform and constant at $T$, and the entire gas phase is at a uniform pressure at each state.\n- Initially, immediately after dosing, the sample has not yet adsorbed any gas (negligible instantaneous uptake), and the gas-phase moles are determined by the initial pressure $P_{i}$ in the total gas volume $V_{t} = V_{c} + V_{d}$.

The problem is self-contained and contains no contradictions.\n\nThe verdict is that the problem is valid. It is scientifically sound, well-posed, and complete. A solution will now be constructed.\n\n**Task 1: Derivation of the Material Balance**\n\nThe system is closed, so the total number of moles of gas, $n_{\\text{total}}$, is conserved.\nInitially, immediately after dosing and before any significant adsorption occurs, all moles are in the gas phase, occupying the total accessible volume $V_{t} = V_{c} + V_{d}$. The initial number of moles in the gas phase, $n_{\\text{gas}, i}$, is equal to the total moles in the system, $n_{\\text{total}}$. Using the provided equation of state at the initial pressure $P_{i}$ and temperature $T$:\n$$P_i V_t = Z_i n_{\\text{gas}, i} R T$$\n$$n_{\\text{total}} = n_{\\text{gas}, i} = \\frac{P_i (V_c + V_d)}{Z_i R T}$$\nAt final equilibrium, the gas pressure has dropped to $P_{f}$. The total moles are now distributed between the gas phase and the adsorbed phase. The number of moles remaining in the gas phase, $n_{\\text{gas}, f}$, is given by the equation of state under the final conditions. The gas still occupies the same accessible volume $V_{t}$.\n$$P_f V_t = Z_f n_{\\text{gas}, f} R T$$\n$$n_{\\text{gas}, f} = \\frac{P_f (V_c + V_d)}{Z_f R T}$$\nThe principle of conservation of moles for the closed system states:\n$$n_{\\text{total}} = n_{\\text{gas}, f} + n_{\\text{ads}}$$\nThe problem statement defines the adsorbed amount, $n_{\\text{ads}}$, as the reduction in gas-phase moles. This is consistent with the conservation law:\n$$n_{\\text{ads}} = n_{\\text{total}} - n_{\\text{gas}, f} = n_{\\text{gas}, i} - n_{\\text{gas}, f}$$\nSubstituting the expressions for $n_{\\text{gas}, i}$ and $n_{\\text{gas}, f}$:\n$$n_{\\text{ads}} = \\frac{P_i (V_c + V_d)}{Z_i R T} - \\frac{P_f (V_c + V_d)}{Z_f R T}$$\nFactoring out the common terms gives the final derived material balance equation:\n$$n_{\\text{ads}} = \\frac{V_c + V_d}{R T} \\left( \\frac{P_i}{Z_i} - \\frac{P_f}{Z_f} \\right)$$\nThis concludes the derivation for Task 1.\n\n**Task 2: Numerical Calculation of Adsorbed Moles**\n\nThe numerical calculation requires strict adherence to unit consistency. We will convert all quantities to base SI units.\nThe given data are:\n- $V_{c} = 55.00 \\ \\text{cm}^{3} = 55.00 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{m}^{3}$\n- $V_{d} = 12.50 \\ \\text{cm}^{3} = 12.50 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{m}^{3}$\n- $P_{i} = 7.000 \\ \\text{bar} = 7.000 \\times 10^{5} \\ \\text{Pa}$\n- $P_{f} = 2.500 \\ \\text{bar} = 2.500 \\times 10^{5} \\ \\text{Pa}$\n- $T = 298.15 \\ \\text{K}$\n- $R = 8.314462618 \\ \\text{J} \\ \\text{mol}^{-1} \\ \\text{K}^{-1}$\n- $Z(P) = 1 - \\alpha P$ with $\\alpha = 2.000 \\times 10^{-2} \\ \\text{bar}^{-1}$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the compressibility factors, $Z_i$ and $Z_f$, using the provided correlation. The correlation requires pressure in units of bar.\n$$Z_i = Z(P_i) = 1 - (2.000 \\times 10^{-2} \\ \\text{bar}^{-1}) \\times (7.000 \\ \\text{bar}) = 1 - 0.1400 = 0.8600$$\n$$Z_f = Z(P_f) = 1 - (2.000 \\times 10^{-2} \\ \\text{bar}^{-1}) \\times (2.500 \\ \\text{bar}) = 1 - 0.0500 = 0.9500$$\nNext, we calculate the total volume $V_t$:\n$$V_t = V_c + V_d = 55.00 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{m}^{3} + 12.50 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{m}^{3} = 67.50 \\times 10^{-6} \\ \\text{m}^{3}$$\nNow, all values are substituted into the derived equation.

The Gibbs-Helmholtz equation states that $\\left(\\frac{\\partial (\\mu/T)}{\\partial T}\\right)_{P} = -\\frac{H_m}{T^2}$, where $H_m$ is the molar enthalpy.

For an exothermic process like physisorption, $q_{st}$ is positive. It is defined as the negative of the differential enthalpy of adsorption: $q_{st} = -\\Delta H_{ads} = -(H_a - H_g) = H_g - H_a$.\nSubstituting $q_{st}$ into the equation yields:\n$$ \\frac{R}{P} \\left( \\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial T} \\right)_{\\theta} = \\frac{q_{st}}{T^2} $$\nThis expression can be rearranged for easier integration by noting that $\\frac{1}{P} \\frac{dP}{dT} = \\frac{d\\ln P}{dT}$:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\ln P}{\\partial T} \\right)_{\\theta} = \\frac{q_{st}}{RT^2} $$\nFinally, using the transformation $d(1/T) = -1/T^2 \\, dT$, we arrive at the desired relation, an analogue of the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:\n$$ \\left( \\frac{\\partial \\ln P}{\\partial (1/T)} \\right)_{\\theta} = -\\frac{q_{st}}{R} $$\nThis equation relates the temperature dependence of the equilibrium pressure at constant coverage to the isosteric heat of adsorption.\n\n**Part 2: Calculation of $q_{st}(\\theta)$**\nThe derived relation can be approximated using a two-point finite difference method for the derivative, assuming $q_{st}$ is constant over the small temperature interval $[T_1, T_2]$:\n$$ \\frac{\\ln(P_2) - \\ln(P_1)}{1/T_2 - 1/T_1} \\approx -\\frac{q_{st}(\\theta)}{R} $$\nwhere $P_1$ and $P_2$ are the equilibrium pressures at temperatures $T_1$ and $T_2$ for a given coverage $\\theta$.\nSolving for $q_{st}(\\theta)$:\n$$ q_{st}(\\theta) \\approx -R \\frac{\\ln(P_2/P_1)}{1/T_2 - 1/T_1} $$\nGiven $T_1 = 300\\,\\mathrm{K}$ and $T_2 = 320\\,\\mathrm{K}$, the denominator is:\n$$ \\frac{1}{T_2} - \\frac{1}{T_1} = \\frac{1}{320} - \\frac{1}{300} = \\frac{300 - 320}{300 \\times 320} = \\frac{-20}{96000} = -\\frac{1}{4800}\\,\\mathrm{K^{-1}} $$\nSubstituting this into the expression for $q_{st}(\\theta)$:\n$$ q_{st}(\\theta) \\approx -R \\frac{\\ln(P_2/P_1)}{-1/4800} = 4800 R \\ln\\left(\\frac{P_2}{P_1}\\right) $$\nUsing $R = 8.314462618\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}\\,K^{-1}}$, we can now calculate $q_{st}$ for each value of $\\theta$:\n\n- For $\\theta=0.05$: $P_1 = 0.080\\,\\mathrm{bar}$, $P_2 = 0.122\\,\\mathrm{bar}$.\n$$ q_{st}(0.05) = 4800 \\times 8.314462618 \\times \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.122}{0.080}\\right) \\approx 16841.80\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} $$\n\n- For $\\theta=0.10$: $P_1 = 0.150\\,\\mathrm{bar}$, $P_2 = 0.230\\,\\mathrm{bar}$.\n$$ q_{st}(0.10) = 4800 \\times 8.314462618 \\times \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.230}{0.150}\\right) \\approx 17058.08\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} $$\n\n- For $\\theta=0.20$: $P_1 = 0.320\\,\\mathrm{bar}$, $P_2 = 0.520\\,\\mathrm{bar}$.\n$$ q_{st}(0.20) = 4800 \\times 8.314462618 \\times \\ln\\left(\\frac{0.520}{0.320}\\right) \\approx 19375.46\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} $$\n\n- For $\\theta=0.30$: $P_1 = 0.600\\,\\mathrm{bar}$, $P_2 = 1.050\\,\\mathrm{bar}$.\n$$ q_{st}(0.30) = 4800 \\times 8.314462618 \\times \\ln\\left(\\frac{1.050}{0.600}\\right) \\approx 22332.86\\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} $$\n\n**Part 3: Interpretation of the Trend of $q_{st}(\\theta)$**\nThe calculated values of the isosteric heat of adsorption are approximately $16.8\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$, $17.1\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$, $19.4\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$, and $22.3\\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$ for coverages of $0.05$, $0.10$, $0.20$, and $0.30$, respectively. It is observed that $q_{st}$ increases as the surface coverage $\\theta$ increases. This trend provides insight into the nature of the adsorption system. Two primary factors influence the coverage dependence of $q_{st}$: energetic heterogeneity of the surface and lateral interactions between adsorbed molecules.\n\n1.  **Energetic Heterogeneity**: If the adsorbent surface were energetically heterogeneous, it would possess a distribution of adsorption sites with varying adsorption energies. Adsorption would preferentially occur on the highest-energy sites first (those with the largest $q_{st}$). As coverage increases, molecules are forced to occupy lower-energy sites, which would result in a *decrease* of the measured $q_{st}$ with increasing $\\theta$. This is contrary to the observed trend.\n\n2.  **Lateral Interactions**: If the surface is energetically homogeneous, the change in $q_{st}$ must be due to interactions between adjacent adsorbed molecules (adsorbates).\n    - If these interactions are repulsive, an incoming molecule would be destabilized by its neighbors. This would make adsorption less favorable at higher coverages, causing $q_{st}$ to *decrease* with increasing $\\theta$.\n    - If these interactions are attractive, an incoming molecule would be stabilized by its neighbors. This cooperative effect enhances the overall binding energy, making adsorption more favorable at higher coverages. Consequently, the energy required to remove a molecule from the surface increases, leading to an *increase* of $q_{st}$ with increasing $\\theta$.\n\nSince the experimental data show a clear increase in $q_{st}$ with $\\theta$, the dominant phenomenon is attractive lateral interactions between the adsorbed gas molecules on the surface of the nonporous oxide.\n\n**Part 4: Calculation of the Mean Isosteric Heat of Adsorption**\nThe arithmetic mean of the four calculated $q_{st}$ values is:\n$$ \\overline{q_{st}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( q_{st}(0.05) + q_{st}(0.10) + q_{st}(0.20) + q_{st}(0.30) \\right) $$\n$$ \\overline{q_{st}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( 16841.80 + 17058.08 + 19375.46 + 22332.86 \\right) \\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} $$\n$$ \\overline{q_{st}} = \\frac{1}{4} \\left( 75608.20 \\right) \\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} = 18902.05 \\,\\mathrm{J\\,mol^{-1}} $$\nConverting to $\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}}$:\n$$ \\overline{q_{st}} = 18.90205 \\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} $$\nRounding to four significant figures as required:\n$$ \\overline{q_{st}} \\approx 18.90 \\,\\mathrm{kJ\\,mol^{-1}} $$", "answer": "$$ \\boxed{18.90} $$", "id": "2467809"}]}
