The planar interface is flat, and the coordinate $x$ is defined to increase from the interface into the host layer.

The governing principle is Fick's laws of diffusion, which are well-established scientific laws. The scenario of diffusion in a bilayer compact during solid-state reaction is a classic and realistic problem in materials engineering. All premises are scientifically sound.\n2.  **Well-Posed**: The problem is well-posed. It asks for the calculation of a diffusive flux and provides all necessary parameters: the diffusion coefficient, the concentrations at two points, and the distance between these points. The assumption of steady-state diffusion over a limited region where the concentration profile is linear simplifies the problem to a direct application of Fick's first law, leading to a unique solution.\n3.  **Objective**: The problem is stated in precise, objective, and quantitative terms. There are no subjective or ambiguous statements.\n4.  **Completeness and Consistency**: The problem is self-contained. The assumption of a \"steady-state\" condition is consistent with the emergence of a \"linear\" concentration profile in a source-free, one-dimensional region, as the steady-state diffusion equation is $\\frac{\\partial^2 c}{\\partial x^2} = 0$, which has a linear solution. The numerical values provided for the diffusion coefficient, length scale, and concentrations are physically plausible for solid-state diffusion in ceramic systems.\n5.  **Other Flaws**: The problem is free from other flaws such as being pseudo-profound, trivial, or unverifiable. It is a standard application of fundamental principles.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\nThe problem is **valid**. A solution will be derived.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\nThe transport of species $A$ is governed by diffusion. The problem states that the system is in a steady state over the thin region of interest. Therefore, Fick's first law of diffusion is the appropriate governing equation. In one dimension, this law relates the diffusive flux $J$ to the concentration gradient $\\frac{dc}{dx}$ and the diffusion coefficient $D$:\n$$J = -D \\frac{dc}{dx}$$\nThe negative sign indicates that the net movement of particles is from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration. The problem defines positive flux as being in the $+x$ direction, which is consistent with this standard formulation.\n\nThe problem specifies that the concentration profile $c(x)$ is approximately linear over the region of thickness $L$, from $x=0$ to $x=L$. For a linear function, the gradient $\\frac{dc}{dx}$ is constant and can be calculated from the concentrations at the two endpoints of the interval:\n$$\\frac{dc}{dx} = \\frac{\\Delta c}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{c(L) - c(0)}{L - 0}$$\nSubstituting the given variables, we have:\n$$\\frac{dc}{dx} = \\frac{c_b - c_i}{L}$$\nNow, we substitute this expression for the gradient into Fick's first law:\n$$J = -D \\left(\\frac{c_b - c_i}{L}\\right)$$\nThis expression can be algebraically rearranged to:\n$$J = D \\left(\\frac{c_i - c_b}{L}\\right)$$\nSince it is given that $c_i > c_b$, the term $(c_i - c_b)$ is positive. As $D$ and $L$ are also positive definite, the resulting flux $J$ will be positive. This confirms that the direction of diffusion is from the interface ($x=0$) into the host layer ($+x$ direction), as expected physically.\n\nThe final step is to substitute the provided numerical values into this equation to calculate the magnitude of the flux.\nGiven values are:\n- $D = 1.20 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\mathrm{m^2\\,s^{-1}}$\n- $L = 1.00 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\mathrm{m}$\n- $c_i = 2.00 \\times 10^{2} \\, \\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-3}}$\n- $c_b = 2.00 \\times 10^{1} \\, \\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-3}}$\n\nThe difference in concentration is:\n$$c_i - c_b = (2.00 \\times 10^{2} - 2.00 \\times 10^{1}) \\, \\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-3}} = (200 - 20) \\, \\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-3}} = 180 \\, \\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-3}}$$\nAlternatively, in scientific notation, this is $1.80 \\times 10^{2} \\, \\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-3}}$.\n\nNow, we compute the flux $J$:\n$$J = (1.20 \\times 10^{-16} \\, \\mathrm{m^{2}\\,s^{-1}}) \\times \\frac{1.80 \\times 10^{2} \\, \\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-3}}}{1.00 \\times 10^{-6} \\, \\mathrm{m}}$$\n$$J = \\frac{1.20 \\times 1.80}{1.00} \\times \\frac{10^{-16} \\times 10^{2}}{10^{-6}} \\, \\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$$\n$$J = 2.16 \\times 10^{-16+2-(-6)} \\, \\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$$\n$$J = 2.16 \\times 10^{-8} \\, \\mathrm{mol\\,m^{-2}\\,s^{-1}}$$\nThe result is already given to three significant figures, which is consistent with the precision of the input data.

The ratio of these weight fractions can be related to the mole ratio of the components.\n$$ \\frac{w_{\\mathrm{CaO}}}{w_{\\mathrm{CaCO_3}}} = \\frac{m_{\\mathrm{CaO}} / m_{\\mathrm{residue}}}{m_{\\mathrm{CaCO_3}} / m_{\\mathrm{residue}}} = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{CaO}} M_{\\mathrm{CaO}}}{n_{\\mathrm{CaCO_3, rem}} M_{\\mathrm{CaCO_3}}} $$\nwhere $n_{\\mathrm{CaO}}$ is the moles of $\\mathrm{CaO}$ produced and $n_{\\mathrm{CaCO_3, rem}}$ is the moles of $\\mathrm{CaCO_3}$ remaining. From stoichiometry, $n_{\\mathrm{CaO}} = n_{\\mathrm{reacted}}$ and $n_{\\mathrm{CaCO_3, rem}} = n_{0,\\mathrm{CaCO_3}} - n_{\\mathrm{reacted}}$. Substituting these into the equation:\n$$ \\frac{w_{\\mathrm{CaO}}}{w_{\\mathrm{CaCO_3}}} = \\frac{n_{\\mathrm{reacted}} M_{\\mathrm{CaO}}}{(n_{0,\\mathrm{CaCO_3}} - n_{\\mathrm{reacted}}) M_{\\mathrm{CaCO_3}}} $$\nDividing the numerator and denominator of the right-hand side by $n_{0,\\mathrm{CaCO_3}}$ yields an expression in terms of the reaction extent $x = n_{\\mathrm{reacted}} / n_{0,\\mathrm{CaCO_3}}$:\n$$ \\frac{w_{\\mathrm{CaO}}}{w_{\\mathrm{CaCO_3}}} = \\frac{x M_{\\mathrm{CaO}}}{(1-x) M_{\\mathrm{CaCO_3}}} $$\nThis equation can be rearranged to solve for $x_{\\mathrm{XRD}}$:\n$$ x_{\\mathrm{XRD}} = \\frac{w_{\\mathrm{CaO}} M_{\\mathrm{CaCO_3}}}{w_{\\mathrm{CaO}} M_{\\mathrm{CaCO_3}} + w_{\\mathrm{CaCO_3}} M_{\\mathrm{CaO}}} $$\nSubstituting the given values $w_{\\mathrm{CaO}} = 0.440$, $w_{\\mathrm{CaCO_3}} = 0.560$, $M_{\\mathrm{CaO}} = 56.08\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$, and $M_{\\mathrm{CaCO_3}} = 100.09\\,\\mathrm{g\\,mol^{-1}}$:\n$$ x_{\\mathrm{XRD}} = \\frac{0.440 \\times 100.09}{(0.440 \\times 100.09) + (0.560 \\times 56.08)} = \\frac{44.0396}{44.0396 + 31.4048} = \\frac{44.0396}{75.4444} \\approx 0.583760 $$\n\nFinally, the single best estimate of the degree of reaction, $x^\\ast$, is the unweighted mean of the three independently calculated values:\n$$ x^\\ast = \\frac{x_{\\mathrm{TGA}} + x_{\\mathrm{DSC}} + x_{\\mathrm{XRD}}}{3} $$\n$$ x^\\ast = \\frac{0.583785 + 0.584132 + 0.583760}{3} = \\frac{1.751677}{3} \\approx 0.583892 $$\nRounding the final answer to four significant figures gives $0.5839$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{0.5839}\n$$", "id": "2524232"}]}
