The model is based on Nabarro-Herring diffusional creep, capillarity as a driving force, and mass conservation, all of which are standard concepts. The expression for sintering stress is a common phenomenological closure for the intermediate stage of sintering. The problem is well-posed, providing sufficient information to derive and solve the requested differential equation.

The given scaling for Nabarro-Herring creep is a proportionality: $\\dot{\\epsilon}_v = K (D_v \\Omega/(k_B T))\\,\\sigma/G^2$, where $K$ is a dimensionless constant of order $10-40$. The problem asks for a final answer in terms of specified variables which do not include $K$. This implies that the constant $K$ is to be absorbed into the dimensionless morphological constant $\\alpha$. This is a standard practice in phenomenological modeling, where multiple geometric and physical prefactors are lumped into a single effective parameter. Thus, the effective sintering stress expression $\\sigma_s = \\alpha \\gamma (1-\\rho)$ is used with an effective $\\alpha$ that already includes the creep proportionality constant.

A rigorous solution can be constructed based on the provided information.\n\n### Derivation of the Solution\n\n**(a) Derivation of the densification rate equation**\n\nThe densification process is governed by Nabarro-Herring creep, where the volumetric strain rate $\\dot{\\epsilon}_v$ under a hydrostatic stress $\\sigma$ is given by the scaling law:\n$$\n\\dot{\\epsilon}_v \\propto \\frac{D_v \\Omega}{k_B T G^2} \\sigma\n$$\nThis can be written as an equality by introducing a dimensionless proportionality constant. The driving force for the volumetric strain associated with densification, $\\dot{\\epsilon}_v^{\\mathrm{dens}}$, is the effective sintering stress, $\\sigma_s$. Therefore, we have:\n$$\n\\dot{\\epsilon}_v^{\\mathrm{dens}} = (\\text{const.}) \\times \\frac{D_v \\Omega}{k_B T G^2} \\sigma_s\n$$\nThe problem provides a closure for the sintering stress:\n$$\n\\sigma_s = \\alpha \\gamma (1-\\rho)\n$$\nSubstituting this into the creep equation gives:\n$$\n\\dot{\\epsilon}_v^{\\mathrm{dens}} = (\\text{const.}) \\times \\frac{D_v \\Omega}{k_B T G^2} [\\alpha \\gamma (1-\\rho)]\n$$\nThe problem requires the result in the form $\\dot{\\epsilon}_v^{\\mathrm{dens}}=f(\\rho)\\,D_v(T)\\,\\gamma\\,\\Omega/(k_B T\\,G^2)$. By comparing forms, we must have:\n$$\nf(\\rho) = (\\text{const.}) \\times \\alpha (1-\\rho)\n$$\nAs established during validation, the dimensionless constant from the creep law is understood to be absorbed into the parameter $\\alpha$. Thus, we proceed by taking the proportionality constant as unity, with $\\alpha$ representing the complete dimensionless prefactor. This leads to:\n$$\n\\dot{\\epsilon}_v^{\\mathrm{dens}} = \\alpha (1-\\rho) \\frac{D_v(T) \\gamma \\Omega}{k_B T G^2}\n$$\nFrom this equation, we identify the function $f(\\rho)$ as:\n$$\nf(\\rho) = \\alpha (1-\\rho)\n$$\n\n**(b) Solution for the time evolution of relative density $\\rho(t)$**\n\nFirst, we must establish the relationship between the densification rate $\\dot{\\epsilon}_v^{\\mathrm{dens}}$ and the rate of change of relative density $\\dot{\\rho} = d\\rho/dt$.

Since $T$ and $G$ are constant, the term multiplying $\\alpha(1-\\rho)$ is constant in time.

All assumptions provided are sufficient for deriving the required expression. We proceed with the solution.\n\nThe central physical principle is that a pore attached to a grain boundary will detach when the driving force for grain boundary migration causes the boundary to move at a velocity that exceeds the maximum possible velocity at which the pore can be dragged. The critical grain size, $D_c$, corresponds to the condition where the intrinsic velocity of the grain boundary, driven by its curvature, is equal to the maximum velocity of the pinned pore. This condition is expressed as:\n$$v_{gb} = v_{p,max}$$\n\nFirst, we establish the expression for the grain boundary velocity, $v_{gb}$. The problem provides the relation $v_{gb} = M_{gb}\\,\\gamma_{gb}\\,\\kappa$, where $M_{gb}$ is the grain boundary mobility, $\\gamma_{gb}$ is the grain boundary energy, and $\\kappa$ is the mean curvature. For a representative grain of characteristic size $D$, the mean curvature is approximated as that of a sphere of diameter $D$, which is $\\kappa \\approx 2/D$. Substituting this into the velocity equation gives the velocity of a free grain boundary:\n$$v_{gb} = M_{gb}\\,\\gamma_{gb}\\,\\frac{2}{D}$$\nAt the critical grain size $D_c$, this velocity is $v_{gb} = M_{gb}\\,\\gamma_{gb}\\,\\frac{2}{D_c}$.\n\nNext, we establish the expression for the maximum pore velocity, $v_{p,max}$. The problem states that the pore velocity $v_p$ is related to the net force $F$ on it by $v_p = M_p F$, where $M_p$ is the pore mobility. The maximum velocity is achieved when the force exerted on the pore by the grain boundary reaches its maximum possible value, the maximum capillary pinning force, which we denote as $F_{max}$. Thus,\n$$v_{p,max} = M_p F_{max}$$\n\nTo determine $F_{max}$, we must use the work-energy argument provided. The problem specifies that the magnitude of the capillary force corresponds to the work done per unit displacement associated with the change in grain boundary area. When the grain boundary advances a distance $dx$, it is stated that its area decreases by an amount corresponding to the area swept by the contact line of circumference $2\\pi a$. The change in grain boundary area is thus $dA = -2\\pi a\\,dx$. The associated change in grain boundary energy is $dE = \\gamma_{gb} dA = -\\gamma_{gb} (2\\pi a\\,dx)$. The force is the negative gradient of the energy, $F = -dE/dx$. The magnitude of the maximum force the boundary can exert on the pore is therefore:\n$$F_{max} = \\left| -\\frac{dE}{dx} \\right| = \\left| -\\frac{-\\gamma_{gb} (2\\pi a\\,dx)}{dx} \\right| = 2\\pi a \\gamma_{gb}$$\n\nThis force depends on the radius of the circular contact line, $a$. We must relate $a$ to the intrinsic properties of the pore, its radius $r$, and the dihedral angle $\\theta$. The problem states the grain boundary is locally planar at the triple line. We consider a cross-section of the spherical pore being intersected by this planar boundary. The dihedral angle $\\theta$ is the angle at the triple junction between the two solid-vapor surfaces. By symmetry, the angle between the tangent to the pore surface and the grain boundary plane at the contact line is $\\alpha = \\theta/2$.\nIn the right triangle formed by the pore's center, the center of the circular contact line, and a point on the contact line's circumference, the hypotenuse is the pore radius $r$. The angle between the radius vector to the contact line and the normal to the grain boundary plane is $\\alpha = \\theta/2$. The radius of the contact line, $a$, is the side opposite to this angle. Therefore, simple trigonometry yields:\n$$a = r \\sin(\\alpha) = r \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)$$\n\nSubstituting this expression for $a$ into the equation for $F_{max}$:\n$$F_{max} = 2\\pi \\gamma_{gb} \\left(r \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\\right)$$\nNow, we can find the maximum pore velocity:\n$$v_{p,max} = M_p F_{max} = M_p \\left( 2\\pi \\gamma_{gb} r \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) \\right)$$\n\nFinally, we apply the critical condition by equating the grain boundary velocity at $D=D_c$ with the maximum pore velocity:\n$$v_{gb} = v_{p,max}$$\n$$M_{gb}\\,\\gamma_{gb}\\,\\frac{2}{D_c} = M_p \\, 2\\pi \\gamma_{gb} r \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)$$\n\nWe solve this equation for the critical grain size, $D_c$.
