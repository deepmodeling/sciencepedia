The existence of such a moment on a transition metal ion is not guaranteed, but rather arises from a delicate balance between orbital energies and electron-electron repulsion, dictated by the ion's chemical environment. This exercise provides a quantitative application of Crystal Field Theory to determine why a $d^8$ ion like $\\text{Ni}^{2+}$ possesses a magnetic moment in an octahedral field but can become diamagnetic in a square-planar geometry, thereby losing its ability to participate in collective ordering [@problem_id:2473883].", "problem": "A transition metal ion contributes a local magnetic moment only if its ground-state electron configuration has at least one unpaired electron; collective magnetic order in solids (ferromagnetism, antiferromagnetism, and ferrimagnetism) emerges only when such local moments exist and are coupled. Consider the ion nickel(II), Ni$^{2+}$, which is $d^8$. Use the framework of crystal field theory (CFT) and the effect of covalency on interelectronic repulsions (nephelauxetic effect) to assess the local moment in two ligand environments and thereby infer whether a material built from such units can support collective magnetic order.\n\nData and definitions to use:\n- The octahedral complex $\\text{Ni(H}_2\\text{O)}_6^{2+}$ has an octahedral splitting parameter $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{oct}} = 1.20\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ and nephelauxetic reduction factor $\\beta_{\\mathrm{oct}} = 0.85$.\n- A square-planar complex with a strong-field, covalent ligand set (e.g., cyanide-like) has a $D_{4h}$ crystal-field level scheme (energies in $\\mathrm{eV}$ relative to the $d$-orbital barycenter): $E(d_{xz}) = E(d_{yz}) = -0.80$, $E(d_{z^2}) = -0.50$, $E(d_{xy}) = +0.10$, $E(d_{x^2-y^2}) = +2.00$.

In octahedral symmetry for $d^8$, the crystal-field stabilization energy is the same for $t_{2g}^6e_g^2$ whether the two $e_g$ electrons are paired ($S=0$) or unpaired ($S=1$); the $S=0$ state adds one extra electron pair and thus costs $P'_{\\mathrm{oct}} = \\beta_{\\mathrm{oct}} P_{\\mathrm{free}} = 0.85 \\times 1.70 = 1.445\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ relative to $S=1$, so $S=1$ is favored and the complex is paramagnetic. In the square-planar field, the diamagnetic configuration occupies $d_{xz}^2 d_{yz}^2 d_{z^2}^2 d_{xy}^2$ and has crystal-field energy $E_{\\mathrm{dia}} = 2(-0.80) + 2(-0.80) + 2(-0.50) + 2(+0.10) = -4.00\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. The lowest $S=1$ alternative promotes one electron from $d_{xy}$ to $d_{x^2-y^2}$, raising the orbital energy by $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{sp}}^{\\ast} = E(d_{x^2-y^2}) - E(d_{xy}) = 2.00 - 0.10 = 1.90\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ while reducing the pairing count by one, gaining $P'_{\\mathrm{sp}} = \\beta_{\\mathrm{sp}} P_{\\mathrm{free}} = 0.70 \\times 1.70 = 1.19\\,\\mathrm{eV}$. The net change is $\\Delta E = +1.90 - 1.19 = +0.71\\,\\mathrm{eV}  0$, so the $S=0$ square-planar state is favored and diamagnetic. Thus, octahedral Ni$^{2+}$ is paramagnetic ($S=1$) while square-planar Ni$^{2+}$ with strong covalency is diamagnetic ($S=0$).\n\nB. Because $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{oct}}$ exceeds the reduced pairing energy, $d^8$ in octahedral fields prefers to pair the $e_g$ electrons ($S=0$) and is diamagnetic; in contrast, the square-planar splitting is insufficient to overcome pairing, so promoting an electron into $d_{x^2-y^2}$ yields an $S=1$ paramagnetic state.\n\nC. Covalency reduces both the crystal-field splitting and the pairing energy by the same factor $\\beta$, leaving their ratio unchanged, so the spin state of $d^8$ is independent of geometry; both octahedral and square-planar Ni$^{2+}$ remain $S=1$ and paramagnetic.\n\nD.

It is a well-defined, scientifically sound problem in inorganic chemistry. I will proceed with the derivation of the solution.\n\n**Solution Derivation**\n\nThe task is to determine the ground spin state of a $d^8$ ion ($\\text{Ni}^{2+}$) in two different ligand environments by comparing the total energies of possible electronic configurations. The total energy is the sum of the orbital energy (from CFT) and the electron-electron repulsion energy (pairing energy, modulated by the nephelauxetic effect).\n\n**Case 1: Octahedral Environment ($\\text{Ni(H}_2\\text{O)}_6^{2+}$)**\n\nFor a $d^8$ ion in an octahedral field, the $d$-orbitals split into a lower $t_{2g}$ set and a higher $e_g$ set. The electronic configuration is uniquely $t_{2g}^6 e_g^2$. The six electrons in the $t_{2g}$ orbitals are fully paired. The spin state is determined by the arrangement of the two electrons in the degenerate $e_g$ orbitals.\n\n-   **$S=1$ (High-Spin) State**: According to Hund's first rule, the lowest energy arrangement places one electron in each of the two degenerate $e_g$ orbitals with parallel spins. The configuration is $t_{2g}^6 (d_{z^2})^1 (d_{x^2-y^2})^1$. This configuration has $3$ electron pairs from the filled $t_{2g}$ orbitals.\n-   **$S=0$ (Low-Spin) State**: To achieve a singlet state, the two $e_g$ electrons must be paired in one of the $e_g$ orbitals. The configuration is $t_{2g}^6 (d_{z^2})^2 (d_{x^2-y^2})^0$ (or equivalently in the other $e_g$ orbital). This configuration has $3$ pairs in $t_{2g}$ and $1$ pair in $e_g$, for a total of $4$ electron pairs.\n\nLet us compare the energies. The Crystal Field Stabilization Energy (CFSE) depends only on the orbital occupancies, which are identical ($t_{2g}^6 e_g^2$) for both spin states.\n$$ \\text{CFSE} = 6 \\times (-0.4 \\Delta_{\\mathrm{oct}}) + 2 \\times (+0.6 \\Delta_{\\mathrm{oct}}) = -2.4 \\Delta_{\\mathrm{oct}} + 1.2 \\Delta_{\\mathrm{oct}} = -1.2 \\Delta_{\\mathrm{oct}} $$\nSince the CFSE is the same, the energy difference between the states is determined solely by the pairing energy. The $S=0$ state has one more electron pair than the $S=1$ state. The energy cost of forming this additional pair is the effective pairing energy, $P'_{\\mathrm{oct}}$.\n$$ \\Delta E = E(S=0) - E(S=1) = (\\text{CFSE} + \\text{pairing energy for 4 pairs}) - (\\text{CFSE} + \\text{pairing energy for 3 pairs}) = P'_{\\mathrm{oct}} $$\nUsing the provided data:\n$$ P'_{\\mathrm{oct}} = \\beta_{\\mathrm{oct}} P_{\\mathrm{free}} = 0.85 \\times 1.70\\,\\mathrm{eV} = 1.445\\,\\mathrm{eV} $$\nSince $\\Delta E = 1.445\\,\\mathrm{eV}  0$, the $S=1$ state is lower in energy. The complex is paramagnetic and possesses a local magnetic moment.\n\n**Case 2: Square-Planar Environment ($D_{4h}$)**\n\nWe compare the energies of the two specified configurations for the $d^8$ ion.\n\n-   **Diamagnetic ($S=0$) Configuration**: The configuration is given as $(d_{xz})^2 (d_{yz})^2 (d_{z^2})^2 (d_{xy})^2 (d_{x^2-y^2})^0$.\n    -   Orbital Energy ($E_{\\text{orb}, S=0}$):\n    $$ E_{\\text{orb}, S=0} = 2 \\times E(d_{xz}) + 2 \\times E(d_{yz}) + 2 \\times E(d_{z^2}) + 2 \\times E(d_{xy}) $$\n    $$ E_{\\text{orb}, S=0} = 2(-0.80) + 2(-0.80) + 2(-0.50) + 2(+0.10) = -1.60 - 1.60 - 1.00 + 0.20 = -4.00\\,\\mathrm{eV} $$\n    -   Pairing Energy: This configuration has $4$ electron pairs. The total energy is $E_{S=0} = -4.00\\,\\mathrm{eV} + 4 P'_{\\mathrm{sp}}$.\n\n-   **Paramagnetic ($S=1$) Configuration**: This configuration is formed by promoting one electron from the highest occupied orbital ($d_{xy}$) to the lowest unoccupied orbital ($d_{x^2-y^2}$). The configuration is $(d_{xz})^2 (d_{yz})^2 (d_{z^2})^2 (d_{xy})^1 (d_{x^2-y^2})^1$.\n    -   Orbital Energy ($E_{\\text{orb}, S=1}$):\n    $$ E_{\\text{orb}, S=1} = 2 E(d_{xz}) + 2 E(d_{yz}) + 2 E(d_{z^2}) + 1 E(d_{xy}) + 1 E(d_{x^2-y^2}) $$\n    $$ E_{\\text{orb}, S=1} = 2(-0.80) + 2(-0.80) + 2(-0.50) + 1(+0.10) + 1(+2.00) = -1.60 - 1.60 - 1.00 + 0.10 + 2.00 = -2.10\\,\\mathrm{eV} $$\n    -   Pairing Energy: This configuration has $3$ electron pairs.

The complex is diamagnetic and has no local magnetic moment.\n\n**Conclusion**: Octahedral $\\text{Ni}^{2+}$ is paramagnetic ($S=1$), while square-planar $\\text{Ni}^{2+}$ in this strong-field, covalent environment is diamagnetic ($S=0$). Therefore, materials based on octahedral $\\text{Ni}^{2+}$ units can exhibit collective magnetic order, whereas those based on these square-planar units cannot.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\nA. In octahedral symmetry for $d^8$, the crystal-field stabilization energy is the same for $t_{2g}^6e_g^2$ whether the two $e_g$ electrons are paired ($S=0$) or unpaired ($S=1$); the $S=0$ state adds one extra electron pair and thus costs $P'_{\\mathrm{oct}} = \\beta_{\\mathrm{oct}} P_{\\mathrm{free}} = 0.85 \\times 1.70 = 1.445\\,\\mathrm{eV}$ relative to $S=1$, so $S=1$ is favored and the complex is paramagnetic.

The net change is $\\Delta E = +1.90 - 1.19 = +0.71\\,\\mathrm{eV}  0$, so the $S=0$ square-planar state is favored and diamagnetic. Thus, octahedral Ni$^{2+}$ is paramagnetic ($S=1$) while square-planar Ni$^{2+}$ with strong covalency is diamagnetic ($S=0$).\n-   **Verdict**: **Correct**. This option accurately reproduces every step of the logical derivation and calculation for both geometries, arriving at the correct conclusions.\n\nB. Because $\\Delta_{\\mathrm{oct}}$ exceeds the reduced pairing energy, $d^8$ in octahedral fields prefers to pair the $e_g$ electrons ($S=0$) and is diamagnetic; in contrast, the square-planar splitting is insufficient to overcome pairing, so promoting an electron into $d_{x^2-y^2}$ yields an $S=1$ paramagnetic state.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. This option misapplies the spin-crossover criterion ($\\Delta$ vs. $P$) to the $d^8$ octahedral case, which is always high-spin. It also reaches the wrong conclusion for the square-planar case; our calculation shows the splitting energy ($1.90\\,\\mathrm{eV}$) *is* sufficient to overcome the pairing energy gain ($1.19\\,\\mathrm{eV}$), favoring the diamagnetic state.\n\nC. Covalency reduces both the crystal-field splitting and the pairing energy by the same factor $\\beta$, leaving their ratio unchanged, so the spin state of $d^8$ is independent of geometry; both octahedral and square-planar Ni$^{2+}$ remain $S=1$ and paramagnetic.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The premise that $\\Delta$ and $P'$ scale by the same factor is faulty and not given in the problem. The core determinant of the magnetic property change is the drastic rearrangement of orbital energies due to the change in geometry from $O_h$ to $D_{4h}$, not a simple scaling. The conclusion that both are paramagnetic is false.\n\nD. Exchange stabilization for unpaired electrons always dominates over orbital promotion energies in $d^8$, so both octahedral and square-planar Ni$^{2+}$ must be paramagnetic; covalency increases $P'$ and further disfavors pairing in square-planar fields.\n-   **Verdict**: **Incorrect**. The first statement is a false generalization; our calculation for the square-planar case shows the orbital promotion energy cost ($1.90\\,\\mathrm{eV}$) dominates the pairing energy gain ($1.19\\,\\mathrm{eV}$). The second statement is also false; covalency (represented by $\\beta  1$) *reduces* the pairing energy ($P' = \\beta P_{\\mathrm{free}}$), making pairing more favorable, not less.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2473883"}, {"introduction": "Once local moments are established, they must interact to produce a collective magnetic state.

A virtual hop of an electron from $\\mathrm{M}_1$ to $\\mathrm{M}_2$ via the oxygen is possible. The intermediate state would have two electrons on $\\mathrm{M}_2$.

In this scenario, virtual charge transfer can occur from two orthogonal oxygen $p$ orbitals to the two metal sites. Hund's rule on the oxygen atom ($J_H^p0$) favors parallel alignment of the electron spins within the oxygen $p$ shell.

The half-filled $e_g$ orbitals on each metal couple to the same central oxygen $p_\\sigma$ orbital ($e_g\\text{–}p_\\sigma\\text{–}e_g$ path). The half-filled $t_{2g}$ orbitals couple to the same oxygen $p_\\pi$ orbitals ($t_{2g}\\text{–}p_\\pi\\text{–}t_{2g}$ path). Both pathways connect half-filled orbitals and thus contribute strongly to AFM kinetic exchange. The total coupling is therefore strongly antiferromagnetic, $J  0$.\n\n*   **Case 2: Two high-spin $d^5$ ions ($t_{2g}^3 e_g^2$) at $90^\\circ$**: All $d$ orbitals are again half-filled. However, at a $90^\\circ$ angle, the problem states that the dominant hybridization pathways from each metal cation are to mutually orthogonal oxygen $p$ orbitals. This \"accidental orthogonality\" ensures that any pathway of the form $d(\\mathrm{M}_1)\\text{–}p(\\mathrm{O})\\text{–}d(\\mathrm{M}_2)$ involving a *single* p-orbital has zero or near-zero overlap. Consequently, AFM kinetic exchange is suppressed. The dominant mechanism becomes the potential exchange, mediated by Hund's coupling on the oxygen ($J_H^p$), which favors parallel spin alignment. The coupling is therefore ferromagnetic, $J > 0$.\n\n*   **Case 3: Two $d^3$ ions ($t_{2g}^3 e_g^0$) at $180^\\circ$**: The $t_{2g}$ orbitals are half-filled, while the $e_g$ orbitals are empty. For the $180^\\circ$ geometry, the $e_g\\text{–}p_\\sigma\\text{–}e_g$ pathway involves empty orbitals and cannot mediate kinetic exchange. However, the $t_{2g}\\text{–}p_\\pi\\text{–}t_{2g}$ pathway connects half-filled orbitals via common $p_\\pi$ orbitals. This gives rise to a strong AFM kinetic exchange contribution. Therefore, the overall interaction is predominantly antiferromagnetic, $J  0$.\n\n*   **Case 4: Two $d^3$ ions ($t_{2g}^3 e_g^0$) at $90^\\circ$**: The $t_{2g}$ orbitals are half-filled. As in Case 2, the $90^\\circ$ geometry suppresses the AFM kinetic exchange pathway due to orbital orthogonality. The dominant interaction is again the FM potential exchange, which requires only that the interacting metal orbitals be partially filled (in this case, half-filled) and that $J_H^p$ is finite. The interaction is thus ferromagnetic, $J > 0$.\n\nNow, I shall evaluate each statement.\n\n**A. For two high-spin $d^5$ ions linked at $180^\\circ$, the exchange is predominantly AFM ($J0$), with sizable contributions from both the $e_g\\text{–}p_\\sigma\\text{–}e_g$ and $t_{2g}\\text{–}p_\\pi\\text{–}t_{2g}$ channels between half-filled orbitals.**\nThis statement is a precise description of the GKA rules applied to the $d^5\\text{–}d^5$ linear bridge. As derived in Case 1, both the $\\sigma$-pathway involving $e_g$ orbitals and the $\\pi$-pathway involving $t_{2g}$ orbitals are active and connect half-filled orbitals, leading to strong AFM coupling ($J0$).\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**B. For two high-spin $d^5$ ions linked at $90^\\circ$, the leading superexchange is FM ($J0$) because the AFM kinetic exchange between half-filled orbitals is symmetry-suppressed by orthogonality of the oxygen $p$ orbitals that each metal sees; a residual FM contribution arises via Hund’s coupling on oxygen $J_H^p$.**\nThis statement accurately reflects the analysis of Case 2. The $90^\\circ$ geometry leads to orthogonality of the main hopping paths, which quenches the strong AFM kinetic exchange. The next-order effect, potential exchange, is FM ($J0$) and is dependent on the Hund's coupling on oxygen, $J_H^p$.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**C. For two $d^3$ ions linked at $180^\\circ$, the exchange is predominantly FM ($J0$) because the empty $e_g$ shell shifts the dominant pathway to $\\sigma$-type hopping that favors parallel alignment.**\nThis statement is incorrect. As analyzed in Case 3, the presence of half-filled $t_{2g}$ orbitals provides a strong $t_{2g}\\text{–}p_\\pi\\text{–}t_{2g}$ pathway for AFM kinetic exchange at $180^\\circ$. This AFM interaction is typically dominant. The claim that the interaction is FM is false. While certain mechanisms involving empty orbitals can be ferromagnetic, they do not supersede the strong kinetic exchange path that is available here.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**D. For two $d^3$ ions linked at $90^\\circ$, the exchange can be FM ($J0$) even though the occupied orbitals are $t_{2g}$, because the two metals couple to orthogonal oxygen $p$ orbitals, suppressing AFM kinetic exchange and leaving a FM contribution from $J_H^p$.**\nThis statement aligns perfectly with the analysis of Case 4. The $90^\\circ$ bridge geometry suppresses the kinetic exchange between the half-filled $t_{2g}$ orbitals. This leaves the FM potential exchange, mediated by $J_H^p$, as the dominant term, resulting in $J0$. The reasoning provided is sound.\n**Verdict: Correct.**\n\n**E. The sign of $J$ in these superexchange-coupled dimers is determined solely by the $\\mathrm{M}\\text{–}\\mathrm{O}\\text{–}\\mathrm{M}$ angle and is insensitive to whether the cations are high-spin $d^5$ or $d^3$ under the stated limits.**\nThis statement is a fallacious overgeneralization. The electronic configuration is a primary determinant of the exchange interaction, as it dictates which orbitals are occupied and thus which exchange pathways are active. While for the specific pair of configurations $d^3$ and high-spin $d^5$, the sign of $J$ happens to correlate with the angle ($180^\\circ \\rightarrow \\text{AFM}$, $90^\\circ \\rightarrow \\text{FM}$), this is a consequence of both configurations possessing half-filled orbitals that enable these mechanisms. To demonstrate that configuration is critical, consider a hypothetical $d^8(t_{2g}^6 e_g^2)\\text{–}\\mathrm{O}\\text{–}d^3(t_{2g}^3 e_g^0)$ linkage at $180^\\circ$. The interaction between the half-filled $e_g$ orbital on the $d^8$ ion and the empty $e_g$ orbital on the $d^3$ ion through the $p_\\sigma$ orbital would lead to a strong ferromagnetic coupling. This contradicts the AFM coupling found for $d^3\\text{–}d^3$ or $d^5\\text{–}d^5$ at the same angle. Thus, the electronic configuration is not an insensitive detail.\n**Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n**F. In the idealized $90^\\circ$ geometry with perfect orthogonality of the relevant oxygen $p$ orbitals and if $J_H^p$ were artificially set to zero, the leading superexchange between half-filled orbitals vanishes by symmetry, so that the net $J$ from the oxygen-mediated superexchange path is strictly zero in this limit.**\nThis statement describes a logical consequence of the model's idealizations. The leading AFM kinetic exchange term is suppressed (\"vanishes by symmetry\") in the idealized $90^\\circ$ geometry due to the orthogonality condition. The leading FM potential exchange mechanism is proportional to $J_H^p$. Therefore, if $J_H^p$ were set to zero, this FM contribution would also vanish. With both leading AFM and FM mechanisms nullified by these two independent, artificial conditions, the net superexchange coupling $J$ within this theoretical framework would indeed be zero. The statement is logically sound.\n**Verdict: Correct.**", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABDF}$$", "id": "2473864"}, {"introduction": "To bridge the gap from microscopic interactions to macroscopic phenomena, we employ phenomenological theories that capture the collective behavior of the system. Landau theory offers a powerful, symmetry-based framework for describing phase transitions, such as the onset of magnetic order at a critical temperature. In this problem, you will use a Landau free energy functional for a collinear antiferromagnet to derive the behavior of its order parameter—the staggered magnetization $L$—near the Néel temperature $T_{N}$, and explore how it is influenced by an external magnetic field [@problem_id:2473885].", "problem": "A centrosymmetric, collinear antiferromagnet with $2$ equivalent sublattices is described near its zero-field Néel temperature $T_{N}$ by a Landau free-energy density in terms of the staggered magnetization $L$ (the sublattice difference) and the uniform magnetization $M$ (the sublattice sum). Consider a weak static, uniform magnetic field $H$ applied collinearly with $L$, so that both $L$ and $M$ can be treated as scalars. By symmetry under time reversal and sublattice exchange, the lowest-order uniform-staggered coupling allowed in the free energy is biquadratic in $L$ and $M$. Assume that near $T_{N}$ the free-energy density can be written as\n$$\nf(L,M;T,H)=\\frac{1}{2}\\,a\\,(T-T_{N})\\,L^{2}+\\frac{1}{4}\\,b\\,L^{4}+\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\alpha\\,M^{2}+\\frac{1}{2}\\,u\\,L^{2}M^{2}-H\\,M,\n$$\nwith $a0$, $b0$, $\\alpha0$, and $u0$ temperature-independent constants in the narrow temperature window of interest, and where the linear Zeeman coupling is to $M$ only.\n\nWorking to leading nontrivial order in both $\\lvert T-T_{N}\\rvert$ and $H^{2}$, compute the equilibrium staggered magnetization $L(T,H)$ just below the transition temperature by minimizing $f$ with respect to $M$ and $L$.

Do not include units in your final expression.", "solution": "The problem presented is a standard exercise in Landau theory of second-order phase transitions, specifically applied to a collinear antiferromagnet. It is scientifically grounded, well-posed, and contains all necessary information for a unique solution. Therefore, I proceed with the analysis.\n\nThe system is described by a free-energy density $f(L, M; T, H)$ which is a function of the staggered magnetization $L$, the uniform magnetization $M$, temperature $T$, and applied magnetic field $H$. The expression provided is:\n$$\nf(L,M;T,H)=\\frac{1}{2}\\,a\\,(T-T_{N})\\,L^{2}+\\frac{1}{4}\\,b\\,L^{4}+\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\alpha\\,M^{2}+\\frac{1}{2}\\,u\\,L^{2}M^{2}-H\\,M\n$$\nThe constants $a$, $b$, $\\alpha$, and $u$ are all specified to be positive. The equilibrium state of the system corresponds to the minimum of the free-energy density. To find this minimum, we must set the partial derivatives of $f$ with respect to the order parameters $L$ and $M$ equal to zero. This gives two coupled equations of state:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial L} = a(T-T_{N})L + bL^3 + uLM^2 = 0\n$$\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial M} = \\alpha M + uL^2 M - H = 0\n$$\nWe are interested in the behavior for $T  T_{N}$, where a non-zero staggered magnetization $L$ is expected. The second equation of state can be rearranged to express the uniform magnetization $M$ in terms of $L$ and the external field $H$:\n$$\nM(\\alpha + uL^2) = H \\implies M = \\frac{H}{\\alpha + uL^2}\n$$\nThis shows that a uniform magnetization $M$ is induced by the external field $H$. The term $uL^2$ in the denominator indicates that the magnetic susceptibility is modified by the presence of antiferromagnetic order.\n\nNow, we substitute this expression for $M$ back into the first equation of state to obtain a self-consistency equation for $L$:\n$$\na(T-T_{N})L + bL^3 + uL\\left(\\frac{H}{\\alpha + uL^2}\\right)^2 = 0\n$$\nFor the ordered phase ($T  T_{N}$), we seek a solution with $L \\neq 0$. We can therefore divide the entire equation by $L$:\n$$\na(T-T_{N}) + bL^2 + \\frac{uH^2}{(\\alpha + uL^2)^2} = 0\n$$\nThis is a nonlinear equation for $L^2$. The problem asks for a solution to leading nontrivial order in $|T-T_{N}|$ and $H^2$. This means we are considering small deviations from the Néel point ($T \\approx T_{N}$) and weak fields (small $H$). Let us define $\\tau = T_{N} - T  0$ for temperatures just below the transition. The equation becomes:\n$$\n-a\\tau + bL^2 + \\frac{uH^2}{(\\alpha + uL^2)^2} = 0\n$$\nWe solve this equation perturbatively. In the limit of zero field ($H=0$), the equation simplifies to $-a\\tau + bL_0^2 = 0$, where $L_0$ is the spontaneous staggered magnetization. This gives the well-known result:\n$$\nL_0^2 = \\frac{a}{b}\\tau = \\frac{a}{b}(T_N-T)\n$$\nSince $\\tau$ is small, $L_0^2$ is also small. We are looking for a solution in the presence of a weak field $H$, so we can assume $L^2$ is close to $L_0^2$. The correction due to the field will be of order $H^2$.\nThe term $\\frac{uH^2}{(\\alpha + uL^2)^2}$ is the source of the field dependence. Since this term is already of order $H^2$, any corrections to $L^2$ within its denominator will lead to higher-order terms in the expansion. Specifically, since $L^2$ is of order $\\tau$, the term $uL^2$ in the denominator is small compared to $\\alpha$ for $T$ sufficiently close to $T_N$. Therefore, to the leading order required, we can approximate the denominator by replacing $L^2$ with $0$:\n$$\n(\\alpha + uL^2)^2 \\approx \\alpha^2\n$$\nThis approximation is justified because any higher-order terms in the expansion of the denominator, such as $2\\alpha u L^2$, when multiplied by $H^2$, would yield terms of order $H^2\\tau$, which are higher order than the terms of order $\\tau$ and $H^2$ that we must retain.\n\nWith this approximation, the equation for $L^2$ becomes:\n$$\n-a\\tau + bL^2 + \\frac{uH^2}{\\alpha^2} \\approx 0\n$$\nSolving for $L^2$ gives:\n$$\nbL^2 \\approx a\\tau - \\frac{uH^2}{\\alpha^2}\n$$\n$$\nL^2(T,H) \\approx \\frac{a}{b}\\tau - \\frac{u}{b\\alpha^2}H^2\n$$\nSubstituting back $\\tau = T_{N}-T$:\n$$\nL^2(T,H) \\approx \\frac{a}{b}(T_{N}-T) - \\frac{u}{b\\alpha^2}H^2\n$$\nThis expression is valid to leading nontrivial order in both $(T_N-T)$ and $H^2$. The problem asks for the staggered magnetization $L(T,H)$, not $L^2$. Taking the positive square root (as magnetization is typically defined as a magnitude):\n$$\nL(T,H) = \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{b}(T_{N}-T) - \\frac{u}{b\\alpha^2}H^2}\n$$\nThis result is physically sensible. It shows that the staggered magnetization is reduced by the application of a collinear magnetic field, and that the phase transition is shifted to a lower temperature $T_{N}(H) = T_{N} - \\frac{u H^2}{a \\alpha^2}$.
