It is scientifically grounded in the Heisenberg model and Weiss mean-field theory, is self-contained, and contains no ambiguities or contradictions. Therefore, the problem is valid and I will proceed with its solution.\n\nThe problem asks for the derivation of the Curie temperature, $T_c$, for a Heisenberg ferromagnet using the Weiss mean-field approximation. We begin with the specified Hamiltonian:\n$$\nH = -J \\sum_{\\langle i j\\rangle} \\mathbf{S}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{S}_j\n$$\nwhere $J > 0$ for a ferromagnet, $\\mathbf{S}_i$ is the quantum spin operator at lattice site $i$ with magnitude $S$ (such that $\\mathbf{S}_i^2 = S(S+1)$), and the sum is over nearest-neighbor pairs.\n\nFirst, we must be precise about the counting conventions. The summation $\\sum_{\\langle i j\\rangle}$ runs over all distinct pairs of nearest neighbors. For a Bravais lattice of $N$ sites with a coordination number $z$ (the number of nearest neighbors for any given site), the total number of nearest-neighbor bonds is $\\frac{Nz}{2}$. The sum thus contains $\\frac{Nz}{2}$ terms. An alternative, but equivalent, way to write the sum is $\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_i \\sum_{j \\in nn(i)}$, where $nn(i)$ denotes the set of $z$ nearest neighbors of site $i$, and the factor of $\\frac{1}{2}$ corrects for double counting.\n\nThe essence of the Weiss mean-field theory is to replace the interaction of a given spin with its neighbors by an interaction with an average, or \"mean,\" field generated by those neighbors. Let us focus on a single site $i$. The part of the Hamiltonian involving $\\mathbf{S}_i$ is:\n$$\nH_i = -J \\mathbf{S}_i \\cdot \\sum_{j \\in nn(i)} \\mathbf{S}_j\n$$\nIn the mean-field approximation, we replace the neighboring spin operator $\\mathbf{S}_j$ with its thermal expectation value, which we denote as $\\langle \\mathbf{S} \\rangle$. Due to the assumption of a spatially uniform magnetization on a Bravais lattice, this expectation value is independent of the site, i.e., $\\langle \\mathbf{S}_j \\rangle = \\langle \\mathbf{S} \\rangle$ for all $j$. The interaction Hamiltonian for site $i$ is then approximated by the mean-field Hamiltonian $H_i^{\\text{MF}}$:\n$$\nH_i^{\\text{MF}} = -J \\mathbf{S}_i \\cdot \\sum_{j \\in nn(i)} \\langle \\mathbf{S} \\rangle = -J \\mathbf{S}_i \\cdot (z \\langle \\mathbf{S} \\rangle)\n$$\nThis has the form of a single spin interacting with an effective magnetic field, often called the Weiss molecular field. Let us define this molecular field vector as:\n$$\n\\mathbf{h}_{\\text{mol}} = Jz \\langle \\mathbf{S} \\rangle\n$$\nThen, the effective single-site Hamiltonian is simply:\n$$\nH_i^{\\text{MF}} = -\\mathbf{S}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{h}_{\\text{mol}}\n$$\nA spontaneous magnetization implies $\\langle \\mathbf{S} \\rangle \\neq 0$ in the absence of an external field. We can choose the quantization axis, say the z-axis, to be along the direction of this spontaneous magnetization. Thus, $\\langle \\mathbf{S} \\rangle = \\langle S_z \\rangle \\hat{z}$, and the molecular field is $\\mathbf{h}_{\\text{mol}} = (Jz \\langle S_z \\rangle) \\hat{z}$. The single-site mean-field Hamiltonian becomes:\n$$\nH_i^{\\text{MF}} = -(Jz\\langle S_z \\rangle) S_{iz}\n$$\nNow, we must compute the thermal average $\\langle S_{iz} \\rangle$ for a spin governed by this Hamiltonian at temperature $T$. By definition of thermal averages in quantum statistical mechanics, and dropping the site index $i$ for simplicity:\n$$\n\\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\text{Tr}(S_z e^{-\\beta H^{\\text{MF}}})}{\\text{Tr}(e^{-\\beta H^{\\text{MF}}})}\n$$\nwhere $\\beta = 1/(k_B T)$. The trace is taken over the $2S+1$ eigenstates of $S_z$, which have eigenvalues $m = -S, -S+1, \\dots, S$.\nLet us define $x = \\beta J z \\langle S_z \\rangle$. The Hamiltonian's eigenvalues are $E_m = - (Jz\\langle S_z \\rangle) m = - \\frac{x}{\\beta} m$. The expression for $\\langle S_z \\rangle$ becomes:\n$$\n\\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{\\sum_{m=-S}^{S} m \\, e^{-\\beta E_m}}{\\sum_{m=-S}^{S} e^{-\\beta E_m}} = \\frac{\\sum_{m=-S}^{S} m \\, e^{xm}}{\\sum_{m=-S}^{S} e^{xm}}\n$$\nThe denominator is the single-spin partition function, $Z(x) = \\sum_{m=-S}^{S} e^{xm}$. The numerator can be written as $\\frac{dZ(x)}{dx}$. Therefore:\n$$\n\\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{1}{Z(x)} \\frac{dZ(x)}{dx} = \\frac{d}{dx} \\ln Z(x)\n$$\nThe partition function $Z(x)$ is a geometric series:\n$$\nZ(x) = \\sum_{m=-S}^{S} (e^x)^m = e^{-Sx} \\frac{(e^x)^{2S+1} - 1}{e^x - 1} = \\frac{e^{(S+1/2)x} - e^{-(S+1/2)x}}{e^{x/2} - e^{-x/2}} = \\frac{\\sinh\\left((S+\\frac{1}{2})x\\right)}{\\sinh\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)}\n$$\nTaking the derivative of its logarithm with respect to $x$:\n$$\n\\langle S_z \\rangle = \\frac{d}{dx} \\left[ \\ln\\left(\\sinh\\left((S+\\frac{1}{2})x\\right)\\right) - \\ln\\left(\\sinh\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)\\right) \\right]\n$$\n$$\n\\langle S_z \\rangle = \\left(S+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\coth\\left(\\left(S+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)x\\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\\coth\\left(\\frac{x}{2}\\right)\n$$\nThis gives us a self-consistent equation for the magnetization $\\langle S_z \\rangle$, since $x$ itself depends on $\\langle S_z \\rangle$:\n$$\n\\langle S_z \\rangle = \\left(S+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\coth\\left(\\left(S+\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\beta J z \\langle S_z \\rangle\\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\\coth\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\beta J z \\langle S_z \\rangle\\right)\n$$\nThe Curie temperature, $T_c$, is the critical temperature at which a non-zero solution for $\\langle S_z \\rangle$ first appears as the temperature is lowered from $T > T_c$. We are therefore interested in the behavior of this equation for infinitesimally small $\\langle S_z \\rangle$. In this limit, the argument of the cotangent functions, $x = \\beta J z \\langle S_z \\rangle$, is also infinitesimally small. We use the Taylor expansion for the hyperbolic cotangent function for small argument $u$: $\\coth(u) \\approx \\frac{1}{u} + \\frac{u}{3} - \\frac{u^3}{45} + \\dots$.\nLet $f(x) = (S+1/2)\\coth((S+1/2)x) - (1/2)\\coth(x/2)$.

A non-trivial solution for $\\langle S_z \\rangle$ can exist only if the coefficients on both sides are equal. This condition defines the critical temperature $T_c$. At $T=T_c$, we have $\\beta_c = 1/(k_B T_c)$, and the condition becomes:\n$$\n1 = \\frac{S(S+1)}{3} (\\beta_c J z) = \\frac{S(S+1)Jz}{3 k_B T_c}\n$$\nSolving for $T_c$, we obtain the closed-form expression for the Curie temperature within the Weiss mean-field approximation for the Heisenberg model.\n$$\nk_B T_c = \\frac{JzS(S+1)}{3}\n$$\nThus, the final expression for the Curie temperature is:\n$$\nT_c = \\frac{J z S(S+1)}{3 k_B}\n$$\nThis result emerges directly from the application of statistical mechanics to the mean-field Hamiltonian, without any a priori assumptions about the value of $T_c$.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{J z S(S+1)}{3 k_B}}\n$$", "id": "2479466"}, {"introduction": "While microscopic models provide fundamental insight, the Landau theory of phase transitions offers a versatile phenomenological framework for describing magnetic behavior near $T_c$.
