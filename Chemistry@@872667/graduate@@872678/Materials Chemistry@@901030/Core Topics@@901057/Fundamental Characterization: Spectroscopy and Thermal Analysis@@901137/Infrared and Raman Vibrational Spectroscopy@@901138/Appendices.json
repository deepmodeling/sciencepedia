No rounding is needed.", "solution": "The problem requires an analysis of the vibrational modes of a planar trigonal molecule, $\\mathrm{BF_3}$, which belongs to the $D_{3h}$ point group. The objective is to determine the number of distinct infrared-active fundamental vibrational frequencies. This analysis will be conducted using the principles of group theory.\n\nFirst, we must determine the characters of the reducible representation, $\\Gamma_{3N}$, which describes the transformation properties of the $3N$ Cartesian displacement vectors of the $N=4$ atoms in the molecule. The character for a given symmetry operation, $\\chi(R)$, is calculated as the product of the number of atoms that remain unshifted by the operation, $U(R)$, and the character of the transformation of the $(x, y, z)$ coordinate system at each unshifted atom.\n\nLet us compute the characters for each class of operation in the $D_{3h}$ group. The total number of atoms is $N=4$ ($1$ B, $3$ F). The total degrees of freedom are $3N=12$.\n\n1.  **Identity, $E$**: All $4$ atoms are unshifted, so $U(E) = 4$. The identity operation leaves $(x, y, z)$ unchanged, represented by a $3 \\times 3$ identity matrix with a trace of $3$. Thus, $\\chi_{3N}(E) = 4 \\times 3 = 12$.\n\n2.  **Principal axis rotation, $C_3$**: Rotation by $120^\\circ$ about the $z$-axis. Only the central Boron atom is unshifted, so $U(C_3) = 1$. The transformation matrix for rotation by an angle $\\theta$ about the $z$-axis has a trace of $1 + 2\\cos\\theta$. For $C_3$, $\\theta = 120^\\circ$, so the trace is $1 + 2\\cos(120^\\circ) = 1 + 2(-\\frac{1}{2}) = 0$. Thus, $\\chi_{3N}(C_3) = 1 \\times 0 = 0$.\n\n3.  **Perpendicular $C_2$ rotation, $C_2'$**: Rotation by $180^\\circ$ about an axis passing through the Boron atom and one Fluorine atom. $U(C_2') = 2$. The trace of a $180^\\circ$ rotation is $1 + 2\\cos(180^\\circ) = 1 - 2 = -1$. Thus, $\\chi_{3N}(C_2') = 2 \\times (-1) = -2$.\n\n4.  **Horizontal reflection, $\\sigma_h$**: Reflection through the molecular ($xy$) plane. All $4$ atoms lie in this plane and are unshifted, so $U(\\sigma_h) = 4$. Reflection through the $xy$-plane transforms $(x, y, z)$ to $(x, y, -z)$, for which the transformation matrix has a trace of $1 + 1 - 1 = 1$. Thus, $\\chi_{3N}(\\sigma_h) = 4 \\times 1 = 4$.\n\n5.  **Improper rotation, $S_3$**: A $C_3$ rotation followed by a $\\sigma_h$ reflection. Only the central Boron atom is unshifted, so $U(S_3) = 1$. The trace for an $S_n$ operation is $-1 + 2\\cos(2\\pi/n)$. For $S_3$, this is $-1 + 2\\cos(120^\\circ) = -1 - 1 = -2$. Thus, $\\chi_{3N}(S_3) = 1 \\times (-2) = -2$.\n\n6.  **Vertical reflection, $\\sigma_v$**: Reflection through a plane containing the principal axis and a B-F bond. This plane contains the Boron atom and one Fluorine atom, so $U(\\sigma_v) = 2$. Such a reflection transforms $(x, y, z)$ to $(x, -y, z)$ (if the plane is $xz$), with a trace of $1 - 1 + 1 = 1$. Thus, $\\chi_{3N}(\\sigma_v) = 2 \\times 1 = 2$.\n\nThe characters for the reducible representation $\\Gamma_{3N}$ are therefore:\nClass: $E, 2C_3, 3C_2', \\sigma_h, 2S_3, 3\\sigma_v$\n$\\chi_{3N}$: $12, 0, -2, 4, -2, 2$\n\nNext, we decompose $\\Gamma_{3N}$ into its irreducible representations ($\\Gamma_i$) using the reduction formula:\n$$a_i = \\frac{1}{h} \\sum_{R} g_R \\chi_i(R) \\chi_{3N}(R)$$\nwhere $h=12$ is the order of the group, $g_R$ is the size of class $R$, and $\\chi_i(R)$ are the characters from the provided table.\n\n$a(A_1') = \\frac{1}{12} [1 \\cdot (12 \\cdot 1) + 2 \\cdot (0 \\cdot 1) + 3 \\cdot (-2 \\cdot 1) + 1 \\cdot (4 \\cdot 1) + 2 \\cdot (-2 \\cdot 1) + 3 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 1)] = \\frac{1}{12}[12 - 6 + 4 - 4 + 6] = 1$\n$a(A_2') = \\frac{1}{12} [1 \\cdot (12 \\cdot 1) + 2 \\cdot (0 \\cdot 1) + 3 \\cdot (-2 \\cdot -1) + 1 \\cdot (4 \\cdot 1) + 2 \\cdot (-2 \\cdot 1) + 3 \\cdot (2 \\cdot -1)] = \\frac{1}{12}[12 + 6 + 4 - 4 - 6] = 1$\n$a(E') = \\frac{1}{12} [1 \\cdot (12 \\cdot 2) + 2 \\cdot (0 \\cdot -1) + 3 \\cdot (-2 \\cdot 0) + 1 \\cdot (4 \\cdot 2) + 2 \\cdot (-2 \\cdot -1) + 3 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 0)] = \\frac{1}{12}[24 + 8 + 4] = 3$\n$a(A_1'') = \\frac{1}{12} [1 \\cdot (12 \\cdot 1) + 2 \\cdot (0 \\cdot 1) + 3 \\cdot (-2 \\cdot 1) + 1 \\cdot (4 \\cdot -1) + 2 \\cdot (-2 \\cdot -1) + 3 \\cdot (2 \\cdot -1)] = \\frac{1}{12}[12 - 6 - 4 + 4 - 6] = 0$\n$a(A_2'') = \\frac{1}{12} [1 \\cdot (12 \\cdot 1) + 2 \\cdot (0 \\cdot 1) + 3 \\cdot (-2 \\cdot -1) + 1 \\cdot (4 \\cdot -1) + 2 \\cdot (-2 \\cdot -1) + 3 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 1)] = \\frac{1}{12}[12 + 6 - 4 + 4 + 6] = 2$\n$a(E'') = \\frac{1}{12} [1 \\cdot (12 \\cdot 2) + 2 \\cdot (0 \\cdot -1) + 3 \\cdot (-2 \\cdot 0) + 1 \\cdot (4 \\cdot -2) + 2 \\cdot (-2 \\cdot 1) + 3 \\cdot (2 \\cdot 0)] = \\frac{1}{12}[24 - 8 - 4] = 1$\n\nThus, the total representation is $\\Gamma_{3N} = A_1' + A_2' + 3E' + 2A_2'' + E''$. The total dimensionality is $1+1+3(2)+2(1)+1(2) = 12$, which matches $3N$.\n\nThe $3N$ degrees of freedom include overall translation and rotation of the molecule. We must subtract the representations for these motions to find the vibrational representation, $\\Gamma_{\\text{vib}}$.\nThe translational modes transform as the Cartesian coordinates $(x,y,z)$. From the problem statement, $(x,y)$ transform as $E'$ and $z$ transforms as $A_2''$. Therefore, $\\Gamma_{\\text{trans}} = E' + A_2''$.\nThe rotational modes for a non-linear molecule transform as rotations about the axes, $(R_x, R_y, R_z)$. For the $D_{3h}$ point group, $R_z$ transforms as $A_2'$ and the degenerate pair $(R_x, R_y)$ transforms as $E''$. Therefore, $\\Gamma_{\\text{rot}} = A_2' + E''$.\n\nThe vibrational representation is $\\Gamma_{\\text{vib}} = \\Gamma_{3N} - \\Gamma_{\\text trans} - \\Gamma_{\\text rot}$:\n$$ \\Gamma_{\\text{vib}} = (A_1' + A_2' + 3E' + 2A_2'' + E'') - (E' + A_2'') - (A_2' + E'')$$\n$$ \\Gamma_{\\text{vib}} = A_1' + (3-1)E' + (2-1)A_2'' = A_1' + 2E' + A_2'' $$\nThe number of vibrational modes is the sum of the dimensions of these irreducible representations: $1 + 2(2) + 1 = 6$, which correctly matches the formula $3N-6=3(4)-6=6$ for a non-linear molecule.\n\nA vibrational mode is infrared (IR)-active if its irreducible representation transforms as one of the Cartesian coordinates $x$, $y$, or $z$. The problem states that $x,y$ transform as $E'$ and $z$ transforms as $A_2''$.\nOur vibrational modes are $A_1'$, two distinct modes of symmetry $E'$, and one mode of symmetry $A_2''$.\n-   The $A_1'$ mode is IR-inactive.\n-   The $A_2''$ mode is IR-active.\n-   The two $E'$ modes are IR-active.\n\nThe question asks for the total number of distinct infrared-active fundamental vibrational frequencies. The decomposition $\\Gamma_{\\text{vib}} = A_1' + 2E' + A_2''$ indicates there are four fundamental vibrations in total. One of type $A_1'$, one of type $A_2''$, and two distinct vibrations both of type $E'$. These two $E'$ modes will in general have different frequencies.\nThe IR-active vibrations are:\n- One non-degenerate mode of symmetry $A_2''$. This corresponds to one fundamental frequency.\n- Two doubly-degenerate modes of symmetry $E'$. Each of these corresponds to a distinct fundamental frequency.\nThe parenthetical \"(count each degenerate irreducible representation once)\" is interpreted to mean that a single degenerate mode, such as an $E'$ mode, accounts for one frequency, not a number of frequencies equal to its dimension. This is standard. Since our analysis yields two distinct modes of $E'$ symmetry, there are two distinct frequencies associated with this symmetry type.\nIn total, there is one frequency from the $A_2''$ mode and two frequencies from the two $E'$ modes.\nThe total number of distinct infrared-active fundamental vibrational frequencies is therefore $1 + 2 = 3$.\n\nFor completeness, we identify the Raman-active modes. A mode is Raman-active if its symmetry is shared with a quadratic basis function. The problem provides $A_1'$ and $E'$ as Raman-active symmetries.\n- $A_1'$: IR-inactive, Raman-active.\n- $A_2''$: IR-active, Raman-inactive.\n- $E'$: IR-active, Raman-active.\nThe molecule exhibits mutual exclusion for the non-degenerate modes ($A_1'$ is Raman-only, $A_2''$ is IR-only), which is a consequence of the center of inversion implicitly present in the $D_{nh}$ groups (e.g. via $S_2 = i$). The $E'$ modes are both IR and Raman active.", "answer": "$$\n\\boxed{3}\n$$", "id": "2493596"}, {"introduction": "Beyond identifying molecular structures, vibrational spectroscopy is a powerful tool for quantitative analysis.

Your goal is to implement a program that fits the angular intensity using tensor-based selection rules to recover the unordered pair of symmetry assignments for the two overlapping modes in each dataset.\n\nUse the following fundamental base and definitions:\n- The differential Raman scattering intensity for a vibrational mode with Raman tensor $\\mathbf{R}$ under incident unit polarization $\\mathbf{e}_{\\mathrm{in}}$ and analyzer unit polarization $\\mathbf{e}_{\\mathrm{out}}$ is proportional to\n$$\nI \\propto \\left| \\mathbf{e}_{\\mathrm{out}}^{\\mathrm{T}} \\, \\mathbf{R} \\, \\mathbf{e}_{\\mathrm{in}} \\right|^{2}.\n$$\n- Consider backscattering along axis $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}} \\in \\{\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}, \\hat{\\mathbf{y}}, \\hat{\\mathbf{z}}\\}$ with parallel polarizations ($\\mathbf{e}_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\mathbf{e}_{\\mathrm{out}} \\equiv \\mathbf{e}$) rotating within the plane perpendicular to $\\hat{\\mathbf{n}}$. The angle of $\\mathbf{e}$ within that plane is denoted $\\theta$ and must be treated in degrees. The unit polarization vectors in the three geometries are:\n    - For propagation along $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$ (in-plane $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}\\text{–}\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$): \n    $$\n    \\mathbf{e}_{z}(\\theta) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos(\\theta) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta) \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix}.\n    $$\n    - For propagation along $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$ (in-plane $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}\\text{–}\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$):\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{e}_{x}(\\theta) = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\\\ \\cos(\\theta) \\\\ \\sin(\\theta) \\end{bmatrix}.\n    $$\n    - For propagation along $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$ (in-plane $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}\\text{–}\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$):\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{e}_{y}(\\theta) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos(\\theta) \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\sin(\\theta) \\end{bmatrix}.\n    $$\n- In point group $D_{2h}$, the Raman-active irreducible representations and their canonical Raman tensors in the crystallographic basis are:\n    $$\n    A_{g}: \\quad \\mathbf{R}(A_{g}) = \\begin{bmatrix} a & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & b & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & c \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad\n    B_{1g}: \\quad \\mathbf{R}(B_{1g}) = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & d & 0 \\\\ d & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix},\n    $$\n    $$\n    B_{2g}: \\quad \\mathbf{R}(B_{2g}) = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & e \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ e & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad\n    B_{3g}: \\quad \\mathbf{R}(B_{3g}) = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & f \\\\ 0 & f & 0 \\end{bmatrix}.\n    $$\n- For the purposes of this exercise, use the following fixed normalized Raman tensors (dimensionless) to define the angular patterns. These numbers are to be treated as known constants:\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{R}(A_{g}) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1.0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0.6 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0.3 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad\n    \\mathbf{R}(B_{1g}) = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1.0 & 0 \\\\ 1.0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix},\n    $$\n    $$\n    \\mathbf{R}(B_{2g}) = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 1.0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1.0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad\n    \\mathbf{R}(B_{3g}) = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1.0 \\\\ 0 & 1.0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}.\n    $$\n\nOverlapping modes:\n- An experimental spectrum at a given wavenumber is the sum of two unresolved mode contributions. If the two modes have Raman tensors $\\mathbf{R}_{1}$ and $\\mathbf{R}_{2}$ and nonnegative scalar scale factors $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ (proportional to product of population, scattering efficiency, and instrumental factors), then the measured intensity at angle $\\theta$ in a given geometry is\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{tot}}(\\theta) = S_{1} \\left| \\mathbf{e}(\\theta)^{\\mathrm{T}} \\mathbf{R}_{1} \\mathbf{e}(\\theta) \\right|^{2} + S_{2} \\left| \\mathbf{e}(\\theta)^{\\mathrm{T}} \\mathbf{R}_{2} \\mathbf{e}(\\theta) \\right|^{2}.\n$$\nHere $\\mathbf{e}(\\theta)$ is one of $\\mathbf{e}_{x}(\\theta)$, $\\mathbf{e}_{y}(\\theta)$, or $\\mathbf{e}_{z}(\\theta)$ depending on the geometry.\n\nAngle convention:\n- All angles $\\theta$ are in degrees. Use trigonometric functions with arguments converted from degrees to radians internally.\n\nSymmetry-to-integer encoding:\n- Use the following integer encoding for irreducible representations: $A_{g} \\mapsto 0$, $B_{1g} \\mapsto 1$, $B_{2g} \\mapsto 2$, $B_{3g} \\mapsto 3$.\n\nFitting and model selection requirement:\n- Given the three geometries and an angular grid $\\Theta = \\{ 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 135, 150, 165 \\}$ (in degrees), first construct the basis intensity patterns $\\left| \\mathbf{e}(\\theta)^{\\mathrm{T}} \\mathbf{R}(\\Gamma) \\mathbf{e}(\\theta) \\right|^{2}$ for each $\\Gamma \\in \\{ A_{g}, B_{1g}, B_{2g}, B_{3g} \\}$ at each $\\theta \\in \\Theta$ and for each geometry. Then, for any unordered pair of symmetry hypotheses $\\{ \\Gamma_{i}, \\Gamma_{j} \\}$ (with repetition allowed), perform a global nonnegative least squares fit of scale factors $\\{ S_{i}, S_{j} \\}$ to minimize the sum of squared residuals between the modeled $I_{\\mathrm{tot}}(\\theta)$ and the measured intensity across the concatenated data from all three geometries and all $\\theta \\in \\Theta$. Select the symmetry pair that yields the smallest total residual.\n\nTest suite and data construction:\n- You must analyze three independent datasets. For each dataset, the measured intensity in each geometry and angle is constructed by summing two mode contributions with scale factors as specified below. There is no added noise, and the tensors are exactly the normalized tensors given above. The three datasets are:\n    - Dataset $1$: $\\{ \\Gamma_{1}, \\Gamma_{2} \\} = \\{ A_{g}, B_{1g} \\}$ with $(S_{1}, S_{2}) = (1.2, 0.8)$.\n    - Dataset $2$: $\\{ \\Gamma_{1}, \\Gamma_{2} \\} = \\{ B_{2g}, B_{3g} \\}$ with $(S_{1}, S_{2}) = (1.0, 0.5)$.\n    - Dataset $3$: $\\{ \\Gamma_{1}, \\Gamma_{2} \\} = \\{ A_{g}, B_{3g} \\}$ with $(S_{1}, S_{2}) = (1.0, 0.05)$.\n- Angles are the same for all three geometries and all datasets: $\\Theta = \\{ 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 135, 150, 165 \\}$ in degrees.\n\nYour program must:\n- Generate the three synthetic datasets exactly as defined above.\n- For each dataset, perform the fitting and model selection over all unordered pairs of symmetry classes encoded as integers in $\\{ 0, 1, 2, 3 \\}$ with repetition allowed.\n- Return, for each dataset, the recovered unordered pair of integers representing the assigned symmetries. For consistency, the pair must be sorted in nondecreasing order.\n\nFinal output format:\n- Your program should produce a single line of output containing the results as a comma-separated list enclosed in square brackets, where each dataset’s result is itself a two-element list of integers, for example, $\"[[0,1],[2,3],[0,3]]\"$.\n\nAngle unit specification:\n- All angles are in degrees. Use degrees when interpreting or reporting angles. No other physical units are required since intensities are treated as dimensionless in this problem.\n\nDeliverable:\n- Implement the complete algorithm described and produce the final line of output in the exact format specified.", "solution": "The problem requires the identification of an unordered pair of Raman-active vibrational modes, $\\{\\Gamma_1, \\Gamma_2\\}$, from their superimposed, angle-resolved intensity data in an orthorhombic crystal of point group $D_{2h}$. The solution is a systematic test of all possible hypotheses against the provided data.\n\nThe fundamental physical principle is that the Raman scattering intensity, $I$, for a mode with Raman tensor $\\mathbf{R}$ depends on the incident and analyzed polarization vectors, $\\mathbf{e}_{\\mathrm{in}}$ and $\\mathbf{e}_{\\mathrm{out}}$ respectively:\n$$\nI \\propto \\left| \\mathbf{e}_{\\mathrm{out}}^{\\mathrm{T}} \\, \\mathbf{R} \\, \\mathbf{e}_{\\mathrm{in}} \\right|^{2}\n$$\nIn the specified parallel backscattering configuration, $\\mathbf{e}_{\\mathrm{in}} = \\mathbf{e}_{\\mathrm{out}} \\equiv \\mathbf{e}(\\theta)$, where $\\theta$ is the polarization rotation angle in degrees. The total measured intensity $I_{\\mathrm{tot}}(\\theta)$ from two overlapping modes with symmetries $\\Gamma_1$ and $\\Gamma_2$, tensors $\\mathbf{R}_1$ and $\\mathbf{R}_2$, and non-negative scale factors $S_1$ and $S_2$ is the incoherent sum:\n$$\nI_{\\mathrm{tot}}(\\theta) = S_{1} \\left| \\mathbf{e}(\\theta)^{\\mathrm{T}} \\mathbf{R}_{1} \\mathbf{e}(\\theta) \\right|^{2} + S_{2} \\left| \\mathbf{e}(\\theta)^{\\mathrm{T}} \\mathbf{R}_{2} \\mathbf{e}(\\theta) \\right|^{2}\n$$\nThis expression forms a linear model with respect to the scale factors $S_1$ and $S_2$.\n\nThe core of the method is to first compute the theoretical basis intensity patterns, $f_{\\Gamma, g}(\\theta) = \\left| \\mathbf{e}_g(\\theta)^{\\mathrm{T}} \\mathbf{R}(\\Gamma) \\mathbf{e}_g(\\theta) \\right|^{2}$, for each Raman-active symmetry $\\Gamma \\in \\{ A_{g}, B_{1g}, B_{2g}, B_{3g} \\}$ and for each scattering geometry $g \\in \\{x, y, z\\}$. The angle $\\theta$ in degrees must be converted to radians for computation, $\\theta_r = \\theta \\cdot \\pi / 180$.\n\nThe polarization vectors are:\n-   $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$-geometry: $\\mathbf{e}_{z}(\\theta_r) = [\\cos(\\theta_r), \\sin(\\theta_r), 0]^{\\mathrm{T}}$\n-   $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$-geometry: $\\mathbf{e}_{x}(\\theta_r) = [0, \\cos(\\theta_r), \\sin(\\theta_r)]^{\\mathrm{T}}$\n-   $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$-geometry: $\\mathbf{e}_{y}(\\theta_r) = [\\cos(\\theta_r), 0, \\sin(\\theta_r)]^{\\mathrm{T}}$\n\nLetting $a=1.0, b=0.6, c=0.3, d=1.0, e=1.0, f=1.0$ from the provided Raman tensors, the basis intensity functions for each symmetry and geometry are:\n-   $\\hat{\\mathbf{z}}$-geometry:\n    -   $f_{A_g, z}(\\theta_r) = (a \\cos^2\\theta_r + b \\sin^2\\theta_r)^2$\n    -   $f_{B_{1g}, z}(\\theta_r) = (d \\sin(2\\theta_r))^2$\n    -   $f_{B_{2g}, z}(\\theta_r) = 0$\n    -   $f_{B_{3g}, z}(\\theta_r) = 0$\n-   $\\hat{\\mathbf{x}}$-geometry:\n    -   $f_{A_g, x}(\\theta_r) = (b \\cos^2\\theta_r + c \\sin^2\\theta_r)^2$\n    -   $f_{B_{1g}, x}(\\theta_r) = 0$\n    -   $f_{B_{2g}, x}(\\theta_r) = 0$\n    -   $f_{B_{3g}, x}(\\theta_r) = (f \\sin(2\\theta_r))^2$\n-   $\\hat{\\mathbf{y}}$-geometry:\n    -   $f_{A_g, y}(\\theta_r) = (a \\cos^2\\theta_r + c \\sin^2\\theta_r)^2$\n    -   $f_{B_{1g}, y}(\\theta_r) = 0$\n    -   $f_{B_{2g}, y}(\\theta_r) = (e \\sin(2\\theta_r))^2$\n    -   $f_{B_{3g}, y}(\\theta_r) = 0$\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows:\n1.  **Generate Basis Vectors**: For each symmetry $\\Gamma$, a basis vector $\\mathbf{b}_{\\Gamma}$ is constructed by evaluating its basis functions $f_{\\Gamma,g}(\\theta)$ at all angles $\\theta \\in \\Theta = \\{ 0, 15, ..., 165 \\}$ and concatenating the results from the three geometries. Each $\\mathbf{b}_{\\Gamma}$ is a vector of length $3 \\times 12 = 36$.\n2.  **Generate Synthetic Data**: For each of the three datasets provided, a \"measured\" data vector $\\mathbf{y}$ is generated. For Dataset $1$ with $\\{\\Gamma_1, \\Gamma_2\\} = \\{A_g, B_{1g}\\}$ and $(S_1, S_2) = (1.2, 0.8)$, the data vector is $\\mathbf{y}_1 = 1.2 \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_{A_g} + 0.8 \\cdot \\mathbf{b}_{B_{1g}}$. The other datasets are constructed similarly.\n3.  **Model Selection via Fitting**: For each dataset $\\mathbf{y}$, we iterate through all $10$ possible unordered pairs of symmetries $\\{\\Gamma_i, \\Gamma_j\\}$ (with repetition) as hypotheses. For each hypothesis:\n    a. A design matrix $\\mathbf{A} = [\\mathbf{b}_{\\Gamma_i}, \\mathbf{b}_{\\Gamma_j}]$ is formed.\n    b. The linear system $\\mathbf{y} \\approx \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{s}$ is solved for the coefficient vector $\\mathbf{s} = [S_i, S_j]^{\\mathrm{T}}$ using Non-Negative Least Squares (NNLS), which minimizes the L2-norm of the residual, $\\| \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{s} - \\mathbf{y} \\|_2$, subject to $S_i, S_j \\ge 0$. This is appropriate because scale factors cannot be negative.\n    c. The residual sum of squares (RSS) for the fit is calculated: $\\text{RSS} = \\| \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{s}_{\\text{fit}} - \\mathbf{y} \\|_2^2$.\n4.  **Identify Best Model**: The hypothesis pair $\\{\\Gamma_i, \\Gamma_j\\}$ that yields the minimum RSS is selected as the correct assignment for the dataset.\n\nThe process is repeated for all three datasets. The final output will be a list of the identified symmetry pairs, encoded as integers ($A_{g} \\mapsto 0$, $B_{1g} \\mapsto 1$, $B_{2g} \\mapsto 2$, $B_{3g} \\mapsto 3$) and sorted for consistency. Due to the exact nature of the data generation (no noise), the correct model is expected to yield a residual of exactly zero, while all incorrect models will have a non-zero residual because the basis vectors for the four symmetries are linearly independent over the combined measurement space. Applying this algorithm yields the unique solution for each dataset.", "answer": "```\n[[0,1],[2,3],[0,3]]\n```", "id": "2493549"}]}
