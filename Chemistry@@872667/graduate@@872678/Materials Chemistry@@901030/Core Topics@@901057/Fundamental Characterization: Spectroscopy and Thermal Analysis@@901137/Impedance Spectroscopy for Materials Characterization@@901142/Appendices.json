It is a standard, non-trivial problem in experimental materials characterization.\n\n**Step 3: Verdict and Action**\n\nThe problem statement is valid. A solution can be derived.\n\n**Derivation of Scaling Laws**\n\nThe core of the problem is to determine how the characteristic parameters of the dielectric relaxation depend on the sample thickness $d$ for each of the two proposed mechanisms. The measured complex permittivity $\\varepsilon^*$ is related to the measured complex impedance $Z^*$ and the vacuum capacitance $C_0 = \\varepsilon_0 A / d$ by the relation:\n$$\n\\varepsilon^*(\\omega) = \\frac{1}{i\\omega C_0 Z^*(\\omega)} = \\frac{d}{i\\omega \\varepsilon_0 A Z^*(\\omega)}\n$$\n\n**Case 1: Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars (MWS) Interfacial Polarization at Blocking Electrodes**\n\nThis phenomenon is also known as electrode polarization. It occurs when mobile charge carriers in a material with non-zero DC conductivity drift under an electric field and accumulate at the insulating (blocking) electrodes. This creates large space-charge layers at the interfaces.\n\nA simple, effective model for this system is a series combination of the bulk resistance, $R_{bulk}$, and an effective interfacial capacitance, $C_{int}$.\nThe bulk resistance is given by Ohm's law for a sample of thickness $d$, area $A$, and DC conductivity $\\sigma_{dc}$:\n$$\nR_{bulk} = \\frac{d}{\\sigma_{dc} A}\n$$\nThe interfacial capacitance, $C_{int}$, arises from the charge accumulation in a thin layer near each electrode. For a simple parallel plate model of this double layer, its capacitance is proportional to the electrode area $A$ and inversely proportional to the microscopic double-layer thickness, $d_{int}$. Crucially, $C_{int}$ is an interfacial property and does not depend on the bulk sample thickness $d$. Thus, we can write $C_{int} \\propto A$.\n\nThis series R-C circuit exhibits a characteristic relaxation time $\\tau_{MWS}$ given by:\n$$\n\\tau_{MWS} = R_{bulk} C_{int}\n$$\nSubstituting the dependence on geometry:\n$$\n\\tau_{MWS} \\propto \\left(\\frac{d}{A}\\right) \\cdot (A) \\propto d\n$$\nThe characteristic relaxation frequency, $f_c$, is inversely proportional to the relaxation time:\n$$\nf_{c, MWS} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\tau_{MWS}} \\propto \\frac{1}{d}\n$$\nNow, let's analyze the apparent low-frequency permittivity. At low frequencies ($\\omega \\rightarrow 0$), the accumulated charge at the electrodes makes the sample behave like a very large capacitor, whose capacitance is dominated by the interfacial capacitance, $C_{int}$. The apparent static permittivity, $\\varepsilon'_s$, is calculated from this low-frequency capacitance, $C_{LF} \\approx C_{int}$, using the sample's bulk geometry:\n$$\n\\varepsilon'_{s, app} = \\frac{C_{LF} \\cdot d}{\\varepsilon_0 A} \\approx \\frac{C_{int} \\cdot d}{\\varepsilon_0 A}\n$$\nSince $C_{int} \\propto A$, we can write $C_{int} = c_{int} A$, where $c_{int}$ is the specific interfacial capacitance (capacitance per unit area). Substituting this gives:\n$$\n\\varepsilon'_{s, app} \\approx \\frac{(c_{int} A) \\cdot d}{\\varepsilon_0 A} = \\frac{c_{int}}{\\varepsilon_0} d \\propto d\n$$\nIn summary, for MWS polarization at blocking electrodes:\n1.  The characteristic frequency scales as $f_c \\propto 1/d$.\n2.  The apparent low-frequency permittivity plateau scales as $\\varepsilon'_s \\propto d$.\n\n**Case 2: Bulk Orientational (Dipolar) Relaxation**\n\nThis relaxation arises from the alignment of permanent molecular dipoles (e.g., polymer side groups) with the applied electric field. The dynamics of this process are governed by the local molecular environment (e.g., viscosity, steric hindrance) and temperature.\n\nThe characteristic relaxation time, $\\tau_{dipolar}$, and the corresponding frequency, $f_{c, dipolar}$, are therefore intrinsic properties of the material at a given temperature. They do not depend on the macroscopic dimensions of the sample, such as thickness $d$ or area $A$.\n$$\nf_{c, dipolar} = \\text{independent of } d\n$$\nSimilarly, the dielectric strength, $\\Delta\\varepsilon = \\varepsilon_s - \\varepsilon_\\infty$, is an intrinsic property that depends on the concentration of dipoles and their dipole moment per the Kirkwood-Fröhlich equation. Since the samples are from a single master film, the composition is uniform. Therefore, $\\Delta\\varepsilon$ and the plateau permittivities $\\varepsilon_s$ and $\\varepsilon_\\infty$ are also intrinsic material constants independent of sample thickness $d$.\n$$\n\\varepsilon_s, \\Delta\\varepsilon = \\text{independent of } d\n$$\nIn summary, for a bulk dipolar relaxation, all features of the normalized permittivity spectrum $\\varepsilon^*(\\omega)$ are independent of the sample thickness $d$.\n\n**Option-by-Option Analysis**\n\n-   **A. Prepare two samples with thicknesses $d$ and $2d$ but identical area $A$. Measure $\\varepsilon^{*}(\\omega)$ over a common frequency window. If the relaxation is MWS at blocking electrodes, then the apparent low-frequency permittivity plateau scales linearly with $d$ and the characteristic peak frequency $f_{c}$ scales as $1/d$, so rescaling the frequency axis by $d$ collapses the MWS features across thickness. In contrast, for a bulk dipolar relaxation, both $f_{c}$ and the dielectric strength $\\Delta\\varepsilon$ are intrinsic and independent of $d$, so spectra already coincide without any $d$-rescaling and do not exhibit the $1/d$ frequency shift.**\n    -   This option correctly states that for MWS, $\\varepsilon'_s \\propto d$ and $f_c \\propto 1/d$. If we plot spectra against a rescaled frequency $f \\cdot d$, the peak position for MWS, $f_c \\cdot d$, becomes a constant, thus collapsing the peaks horizontally.\n    -   This option also correctly states that for bulk dipolar relaxation, both $f_c$ and $\\Delta\\varepsilon$ are independent of $d$, meaning the spectra for different thicknesses will naturally superimpose without any scaling.\n    -   The described protocol and signatures provide an unambiguous way to distinguish the two mechanisms.\n    -   **Verdict: Correct.**\n\n-   **B.

If the relaxation is MWS at blocking electrodes, $f_{c}$ scales as $1/d^{2}$ and the low-frequency permittivity scales as $1/d$, so rescaling the frequency axis by $d^{2}$ collapses the features; for bulk dipolar relaxation, $f_{c}$ scales as $1/d$ because the geometric capacitance depends on $d$.**\n    -   The scaling law for MWS is incorrect. We derived $f_c \\propto 1/d$, not $1/d^2$. The permittivity scaling is also wrong; we derived $\\varepsilon'_s \\propto d$, not $1/d$.\n    -   The description for bulk dipolar relaxation is incorrect. The characteristic frequency $f_c$ is an intrinsic property and does not scale with $d$.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **C. Keep thickness $d$ fixed and vary only the area $A$ by a factor of $2$. If the relaxation is MWS at blocking electrodes, the characteristic frequency $f_{c}$ scales as $1/A$ and the low-frequency permittivity scales with $A$, whereas for bulk dipolar relaxation both quantities are independent of $A$, so comparing different $A$ isolates the mechanism.**\n    -   Permittivity $\\varepsilon^*$ is an intensive property, designed to be independent of sample geometry for a homogeneous bulk material. As derived previously for MWS, $\\tau_{MWS} \\propto (d/A) \\cdot A \\propto d$, which is independent of $A$. Therefore, $f_c$ for MWS is independent of $A$. Also, $\\varepsilon'_{s, app} \\propto d$, which is also independent of $A$. The option's claims about MWS scaling with $A$ are incorrect. While the statement for bulk dipolar relaxation (independence from $A$) is correct, varying $A$ would not distinguish the mechanisms because permittivity is independent of $A$ in both cases.\n    -   **Verdict: Incorrect.**\n\n-   **D. Prepare two samples with thicknesses $d$ and $2d$ and collapse the loss peaks by rescaling the frequency axis by the bulk conductivity $\\sigma$ alone.
