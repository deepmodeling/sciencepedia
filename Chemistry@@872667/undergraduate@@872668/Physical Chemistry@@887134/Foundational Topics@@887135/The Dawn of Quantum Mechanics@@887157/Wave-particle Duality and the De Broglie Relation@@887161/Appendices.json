This problem connects concepts from electrostatics and quantum mechanics.\n\nFirst, we consider the energy gained by an electron accelerated from rest through a potential difference $V$. The work done on the electron by the electric field is converted into kinetic energy, $K$. The work done on a charge $e$ moving through a potential difference $V$ is $W = eV$. Therefore, the kinetic energy of the electron is:\n$$ K = e V $$\n\nNext, we need to relate the kinetic energy of the electron to its de Broglie wavelength. The de Broglie relation connects the wavelength $\\lambda$ of a particle to its momentum $p$:\n$$ \\lambda = \\frac{h}{p} $$\nFrom this, we can express the momentum in terms of the wavelength:\n$$ p = \\frac{h}{\\lambda} $$\n\nThe kinetic energy of a non-relativistic particle can also be expressed in terms of its momentum $p$ and mass $m_e$:\n$$ K = \\frac{1}{2} m_e v^2 $$\nSince $p = m_e v$, we can write $v = p/m_e$.
