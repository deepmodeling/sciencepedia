The principal rotation axis is the $C_{3}$ axis passing through the nitrogen atom and the centroid of the hydrogen triangle; this is the highest-order axis in the molecule.\n\nA vertical mirror plane $\\sigma_{v}$ is defined as a plane that contains the principal axis. For $\\text{NH}_{3}$, any such plane that is a symmetry plane must map the set of atoms onto itself. Each plane that contains the $C_{3}$ axis and one N–H bond reflects the molecule such that the hydrogen on that bond is left invariant while the other two hydrogens are interchanged; this is a valid symmetry operation because all N–H bonds and H positions are equivalent. There are exactly three such choices, one for each N–H bond, yielding three distinct $\\sigma_{v}$ planes. No additional vertical planes exist that preserve the atomic positions because any plane not containing an N–H bond would not map hydrogens onto hydrogens correctly. Therefore, the point group is $C_{3v}$, which has exactly three $\\sigma_{v}$ planes.\n\nHence, the total number of distinct vertical mirror planes is $3$, corresponding to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1994294"}, {"introduction": "Next, we tackle one of the more conceptually challenging symmetry elements: the improper rotation axis ($S_n$). The allene molecule ($\\text{H}_2\\text{C=C=CH}_2$) is a perfect case study, as its overall symmetry is not immediately obvious and is largely defined by the presence of an $S_4$ axis. This practice will sharpen your ability to visualize the two-step process of rotation-plus-reflection and identify these key elements in non-planar molecules [@problem_id:1994316].", "problem": "Consider the allene molecule, $\\text{C}_3\\text{H}_4$, which has the chemical structure $\\text{H}_2\\text{C=C=CH}_2$.

For instance, if one H–C–H group lies in the xz-plane, the other lies in the yz-plane.\n\nAn improper rotation, denoted by the symmetry operation $S_n$, is a composite operation consisting of two steps: first, a rotation by an angle of $2\\pi/n$ radians about an axis (the $S_n$ axis), followed by a reflection through a plane that is perpendicular to this axis.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly identifies the highest-order improper rotation axis ($S_n$) present in the allene molecule, aligned with the C–C–C atomic backbone?\n\nA) The molecule does not possess any improper rotation axis.\n\nB) The highest-order improper rotation axis is an $S_2$ axis.\n\nC) The highest-order improper rotation axis is an $S_4$ axis.\n\nD) The highest-order improper rotation axis is an $S_6$ axis.\n\nE) The highest-order improper rotation axis is an $S_8$ axis.", "solution": "Let the linear C–C–C backbone of allene define the $z$-axis, with the central carbon at $z=0$, the terminal carbons at $z=+a$ and $z=-a$, and the two $\\text{CH}_{2}$ groups arranged so that one H–C–H group lies in the $xz$-plane and the other in the $yz$-plane. Denote by $\\phi$ the azimuthal angle around the $z$-axis in the $xy$-plane. Then we can represent the hydrogen positions (by their azimuths and $z$-coordinates) as follows: the two hydrogens on the $z=+a$ carbon are at $(\\phi,z)=(0,+a)$ and $(\\pi,+a)$ (lying on the $x$-axis), while the two hydrogens on the $z=-a$ carbon are at $(\\phi,z)=(\\frac{\\pi}{2},-a)$ and $(\\frac{3\\pi}{2},-a)$ (lying on the $y$-axis).\n\nAn improper rotation $S_{n}$ is defined as a rotation by angle $2\\pi/n$ about the axis followed by reflection through a plane perpendicular to that axis. Equivalently, one may write $S_{n}=\\sigma_{h}C_{n}$ for a plane $\\sigma_{h}$ perpendicular to the axis. We now test which $S_{n}$ along the $z$-axis are symmetry operations of allene and identify the highest order present.\n\n1) Existence of $S_{4}$. Apply $S_{4}$ about $z$, i.e., $C_{4}$: $\\phi\\to\\phi+\\frac{\\pi}{2}$, followed by $\\sigma_{h}$: $z\\to -z$. Under $C_{4}$, the top hydrogens $(0,+a)$ and $(\\pi,+a)$ map to $(\\frac{\\pi}{2},+a)$ and $(\\frac{3\\pi}{2},+a)$; then $\\sigma_{h}$ maps them to $(\\frac{\\pi}{2},-a)$ and $(\\frac{3\\pi}{2},-a)$, which coincide with the original bottom hydrogens. Similarly, the bottom hydrogens map onto the original top hydrogens. The terminal carbons at $z=\\pm a$ are exchanged, and the central carbon at $z=0$ is fixed. Therefore, $S_{4}$ leaves the molecule indistinguishable from its original configuration, so an $S_{4}$ axis along $z$ exists.\n\nMoreover, since $S_{4}$ is a symmetry, its square $S_{4}^{2}=C_{2}$ is also a symmetry; this is consistent with the known presence of a $C_{2}$ rotation about $z$ in the $D_{2d}$ point group of allene.\n\n2) Nonexistence of $S_{6}$. Apply $S_{6}$ about $z$, i.e., $C_{6}$: $\\phi\\to\\phi+\\frac{\\pi}{3}$, followed by $\\sigma_{h}$: $z\\to -z$. The top hydrogens $(0,+a)$ and $(\\pi,+a)$ map to $(\\frac{\\pi}{3},-a)$ and $(\\frac{4\\pi}{3},-a)$, which do not coincide with $(\\frac{\\pi}{2},-a)$ and $(\\frac{3\\pi}{2},-a)$. Hence $S_{6}$ is not a symmetry.\n\n3) Nonexistence of $S_{8}$. Apply $S_{8}$: $C_{8}$ gives $\\phi\\to\\phi+\\frac{\\pi}{4}$ and then $\\sigma_{h}$ flips $z$. The top hydrogens map to $(\\frac{\\pi}{4},-a)$ and $(\\frac{5\\pi}{4},-a)$, which again do not match the bottom hydrogens’ positions. Hence $S_{8}$ is not a symmetry.\n\n4) Nonexistence of $S_{2}$. Note that $S_{2}=C_{2}\\sigma_{h}$ is equivalent to inversion $i$. In Cartesian form, $S_{2}$ would map $(x,y,z)\\to(-x,-y,-z)$. The set of top hydrogens at $(\\pm x_{0},0,+a)$ would map to $(\\mp x_{0},0,-a)$, which does not coincide with the bottom hydrogens at $(0,\\pm y_{0},-a)$. Therefore, there is no inversion center and no $S_{2}$.\n\nFrom these mappings, the only improper rotation axis of highest order aligned with the C–C–C backbone is $S_{4}$. No higher-order $S_{n}$ along this axis is present, and $S_{2}$ is absent.
