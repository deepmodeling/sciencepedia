The fluid consists of a neutral, but electrically polarizable, macromolecule solute suspended in a stationary solvent. A key experimental observation is that applying a static, uniform electric field across a sample of this fluid induces a steady-state mass flux of the neutral solute. This effect is a form of coupled transport.\n\nLet us formalize the thermodynamic fluxes and forces relevant to this system. The primary fluxes of interest are the mass flux of the solute, $\\vec{J}_m$, and the electric current density, $\\vec{J}_e$. The corresponding thermodynamic driving forces are derived from gradients of thermodynamic potentials. For this isothermal system, the main forces are the \"diffusive force,\" which is proportional to the negative concentration gradient of the solute ($-\\nabla c$), and the \"electric force,\" which is the electric field $\\vec{E}$ itself (equal to the negative gradient of the electric potential, $-\\nabla \\phi$).\n\nThe observed phenomenon is the coupling where the electric force ($\\vec{E}$) drives a mass flux ($\\vec{J}_m$). According to the Onsager reciprocal relations, which govern coupled transport phenomena near equilibrium, another coupled effect must also occur in this system. Which of the following options correctly describes this reciprocal phenomenon by identifying the driving force and the resulting flux?\n\nA. A concentration gradient of the solute ($\\nabla c$) will cause a change in the electric field ($\\vec{E}$).\n\nB. A concentration gradient of the solute ($\\nabla c$) will cause an electric current density ($\\vec{J}_e$).\n\nC. The presence of an electric current ($\\vec{J}_e$) will cause the solute macromolecules to diffuse.\n\nD. This scenario is physically impossible because a neutral solute cannot be affected by an electric field, nor can its movement generate an electric current.\n\nE. An electric field ($\\vec{E}$) will cause the solute molecules to accelerate indefinitely rather than produce a steady flux.", "solution": "Near equilibrium and at fixed temperature, linear irreversible thermodynamics writes each flux as a linear combination of all admissible thermodynamic forces.

This implies the vector coefficients $\\vec{L}_{rq}$ and $\\vec{L}_{rc}$ must be zero vectors: $\\vec{L}_{rq} = \\vec{0}$ and $\\vec{L}_{rc} = \\vec{0}$.\n-   Similarly, the coupling between the vector fluxes $\\vec{J}_q, \\vec{J}_c$ and the scalar force $X_r$ is forbidden.
