In ethyl chloride, the methyl and methylene protons are in close spatial proximity (short $r$), ensuring a detectable NOE. The NOE affects intensities but does not alter scalar couplings, so the methyl multiplicity remains a triplet; only its intensity increases in the difference spectrum that reports the change.\n\nHence, the most likely observation is an increase in the methyl signal intensity.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2016199"}, {"introduction": "Having seen the characteristic positive NOE for small molecules [@problem_id:2016199], we now explore what happens when molecular motion slows down dramatically.

A key experiment involves measuring the Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE), which is the transfer of nuclear spin polarization from one nucleus to another through space. When a specific proton, S, on the drug molecule is irradiated, a positive NOE enhancement is observed on a nearby proton, I.\n\nThe chemist then performs a second experiment. The drug molecule is added to a solution containing a much larger protein to which it binds tightly, forming a single, large biomolecular complex. This complex tumbles slowly in solution.

The sign of the NOE cannot be determined without knowing the specific spectrometer frequency.", "solution": "The problem requires us to determine how the sign of the Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) changes when a small molecule, which tumbles rapidly, binds to a large protein, causing the entire complex to tumble slowly. The sign and magnitude of the NOE are critically dependent on the rotational correlation time, $\\tau_c$, which is a measure of how quickly the molecule tumbles in solution.\n\nThe NOE enhancement, $\\eta_{I}\\{S\\}$, observed on spin $I$ upon saturating spin $S$ is proportional to the cross-relaxation rate, $\\sigma_{IS}$, between the two spins. For a pair of homonuclear spins (like two protons) relaxing solely via the dipole-dipole mechanism, the cross-relaxation rate is given by:\n$$\n\\sigma_{IS} = \\frac{1}{10} \\left( \\frac{\\mu_0}{4\\pi} \\right)^2 \\frac{\\hbar^2 \\gamma^4}{r^6} [6J(2\\omega_0) - J(0)]\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio of the proton, $r$ is the internuclear distance, $\\omega_0$ is the Larmor frequency of the protons, and $J(\\omega)$ is the spectral density function. Since all the prefactors are positive constants, the sign of the NOE is determined by the sign of the term $[6J(2\\omega_0) - J(0)]$.\n\nThe spectral density function, $J(\\omega)$, describes the frequency distribution of the molecular tumbling motions. For a simple model of isotropic tumbling, it is given by:\n$$\nJ(\\omega) = \\frac{2\\tau_c}{1 + (\\omega \\tau_c)^2}\n$$\nwhere $\\tau_c$ is the rotational correlation time.\n\nLet's analyze the two cases presented in the problem.\n\nCase 1: The small, free drug molecule.\nA small molecule tumbles very rapidly in solution. This corresponds to a short correlation time, $\\tau_c$. This regime is known as the \"extreme narrowing limit,\" where $\\omega_0 \\tau_c \\ll 1$. In this limit, the denominator of the spectral density function is approximately 1 for all relevant frequencies.\n$$\nJ(\\omega) \\approx 2\\tau_c \\quad (\\text{for } \\omega_0 \\tau_c \\ll 1)\n$$\nThus, $J(0) \\approx 2\\tau_c$ and $J(2\\omega_0) \\approx 2\\tau_c$. Substituting these into the expression for the sign of the NOE:\n$$\n\\text{Sign} \\propto [6J(2\\omega_0) - J(0)] \\approx [6(2\\tau_c) - 2\\tau_c] = 10\\tau_c\n$$\nSince $\\tau_c$ is inherently positive, the cross-relaxation rate is positive, resulting in a positive NOE. This is consistent with the initial observation given in the problem. The theoretical maximum NOE for homonuclear spins in this limit is +0.5 or +50%.\n\nCase 2: The drug molecule bound to a large protein.\nWhen the small drug molecule binds to a large protein, the entire complex tumbles as a single unit. Large macromolecules tumble very slowly, which corresponds to a long correlation time, $\\tau_c$. This regime is known as the \"slow-motion limit\" or \"spin-diffusion limit,\" where $\\omega_0 \\tau_c \\gg 1$.\n\nIn this limit, we analyze the spectral density function terms separately:\nFor $J(0)$, the frequency is $\\omega=0$:\n$$\nJ(0) = \\frac{2\\tau_c}{1 + (0 \\cdot \\tau_c)^2} = 2\\tau_c\n$$\nFor $J(2\\omega_0)$, the frequency is $2\\omega_0$. Since $\\omega_0 \\tau_c \\gg 1$, it is also true that $2\\omega_0 \\tau_c \\gg 1$. Therefore, in the denominator $1 + (2\\omega_0 \\tau_c)^2 \\approx (2\\omega_0 \\tau_c)^2$.\n$$\nJ(2\\omega_0) = \\frac{2\\tau_c}{1 + (2\\omega_0 \\tau_c)^2} \\approx \\frac{2\\tau_c}{(2\\omega_0 \\tau_c)^2} = \\frac{2\\tau_c}{4\\omega_0^2 \\tau_c^2} = \\frac{1}{2\\omega_0^2 \\tau_c}\n$$\nNow, we substitute these into the expression for the sign of the NOE:\n$$\n\\text{Sign} \\propto [6J(2\\omega_0) - J(0)] \\approx \\left[ 6 \\left(\\frac{1}{2\\omega_0^2 \\tau_c}\\right) - 2\\tau_c \\right] = \\left[ \\frac{3}{\\omega_0^2 \\tau_c} - 2\\tau_c \\right]\n$$\nIn the slow-motion limit ($\\tau_c$ is large), the first term $\\frac{3}{\\omega_0^2 \\tau_c}$ becomes very small and approaches zero, while the second term $-2\\tau_c$ becomes large and negative. Therefore, the entire expression becomes negative.\n$$\n\\text{Sign} \\propto -2\\tau_c < 0\n$$\nThis means the cross-relaxation rate becomes negative, and consequently, the NOE becomes negative. The theoretical maximum NOE for homonuclear spins in this limit is -1.0 or -100%.\n\nThe transition from a small molecule (fast tumbling, short $\\tau_c$, positive NOE) to a large complex (slow tumbling, long $\\tau_c$, negative NOE) causes the sign of the NOE to flip from positive to negative. The NOE passes through zero at the specific point where $6J(2\\omega_0) = J(0)$, which corresponds to $\\omega_0 \\tau_c \\approx 1.12$, but for a \"large, slowly tumbling protein,\" the condition $\\omega_0 \\tau_c \\gg 1$ will be met, placing it firmly in the negative NOE regime. Therefore, the expected outcome is a negative NOE.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2016234"}, {"introduction": "The most powerful application of the NOE is its use as a \"molecular ruler\" for determining the three-dimensional structures of molecules. This ability stems from the effect's exquisite sensitivity to the distance between interacting nuclei.
