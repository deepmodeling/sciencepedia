Its chemical properties are fundamentally dictated by its electronic structure. This problem requires you to determine the ground state electronic term symbol for this important diatomic ion based on its valence electron configuration in the framework of Molecular Orbital (MO) theory.\n\nThe valence molecular orbitals for a second-row homonuclear diatomic molecule, in order of increasing energy from $O_2$ onwards, are: $\\sigma_g(2s), \\sigma_u^*(2s), \\sigma_g(2p_z), \\pi_u(p_{x,y}), \\pi_g^*(p_{x,y}), \\sigma_u^*(2p_z)$.

The open shell is $\\pi_{g}^{*}$, which is doubly degenerate (components with $m_l=\\pm 1$), containing three electrons.\n\nBy Hund’s first rule, we maximize the total spin $S$ within the constraints of the Pauli principle. With three electrons in two degenerate $\\pi$ orbitals, one orbital must be doubly occupied (a singlet pair) and the other singly occupied, giving $S=\\frac{1}{2}$ and hence multiplicity $2S+1=2$.\n\nTo determine the resultant $\\Lambda$, note that each electron in the $\\pi$ set contributes an orbital angular momentum projection of $+1$ or $-1$. For the three electrons in the $\\pi_g^*$ shell, the total projection can be $M_L = (+1) + (+1) + (-1) = +1$ or $M_L = (+1) + (-1) + (-1) = -1$. The magnitude is $|\\Lambda|=1$, i.e., a $\\Pi$ state.

A fully occupied subshell always contributes $g$ parity to the state. Therefore, we only need to consider the open $(\\pi_{g}^{*})^3$ subshell. The overall parity is the product of the parities of these three electrons: $g \\otimes g \\otimes g = g$.
