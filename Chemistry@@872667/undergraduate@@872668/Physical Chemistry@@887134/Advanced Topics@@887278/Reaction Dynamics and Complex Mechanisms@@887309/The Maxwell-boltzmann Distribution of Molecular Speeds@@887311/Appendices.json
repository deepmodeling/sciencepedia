The system is maintained in thermal equilibrium at a constant absolute temperature $T$. The mass of a xenon atom, $m_{\\text{Xe}}$, is significantly greater than the mass of a helium atom, $m_{\\text{He}}$.\n\nA student makes the following claim: \"At any given instant, it is physically impossible for any individual xenon atom to be moving faster than any individual helium atom. This is because at the same temperature, their average kinetic energies are equal, and since xenon is much heavier, its speed must be lower to compensate.\"\n\nEvaluate the student's claim by selecting the most physically accurate statement from the options below.\n\nA. The claim is correct. At thermal equilibrium, the average kinetic energy of all atoms is the same. Since kinetic energy is proportional to mass times velocity squared, a heavier atom like xenon must always have a lower speed than a lighter atom like helium to maintain the same kinetic energy.\n\nB. The claim is incorrect. While the root-mean-square speed of xenon is indeed lower than that of helium, the instantaneous speeds of the atoms for each species follow a probability distribution. These distributions have tails that extend to high speeds, meaning there is a non-zero probability of finding a very fast xenon atom and a very slow helium atom such that the xenon atom's speed is greater.\n\nC. The claim is correct. The most probable speed for a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its atomic mass. Since xenon is much more massive than helium, its entire speed distribution is shifted to lower values, preventing any overlap with the helium speed distribution.\n\nD. The claim is incorrect, but only when considering temperatures high enough for relativistic effects to become significant. In the classical, non-relativistic regime described by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, the claim is a valid approximation.\n\nE. The claim is correct, but only if the concentration of xenon is much higher than that of helium. In this case, collisions would suppress the speeds of the rare helium atoms, ensuring they are always slower than the xenon atoms.", "solution": "At thermal equilibrium, the equipartition theorem gives the mean kinetic energy per translational degree of freedom as $\\frac{1}{2} k_{B} T$, so for any monatomic ideal gas species,\n$$\n\\left\\langle \\frac{1}{2} m v^{2} \\right\\rangle = \\frac{3}{2} k_{B} T,\n$$\nindependent of the particle mass $m$.

The claim does not depend on relativistic effects; in the classical Maxwell-Boltzmann regime the overlap exists, so option D is false. The equilibrium Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions for each species depend on $m$ and $T$ but not on the species concentrations in a way that would enforce one species always being slower; thus option E is also false.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is that the claim is incorrect because of the probabilistic, overlapping nature of the Maxwell-Boltzmann speed distributions, even though xenon has a lower root-mean-square speed.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2015105"}, {"introduction": "Having established both the derivation and the conceptual basis of the distribution, we can now apply these principles to solve a practical problem.
