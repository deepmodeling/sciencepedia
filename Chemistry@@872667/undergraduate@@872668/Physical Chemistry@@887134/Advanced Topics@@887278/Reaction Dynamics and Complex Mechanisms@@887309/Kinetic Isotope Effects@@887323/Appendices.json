A measured KIE value provides crucial clues about the nature of the rate-determining step and the structure of the transition state.

To probe the involvement of a specific carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond in the rate-determining step, two parallel experiments are conducted under identical conditions. In the first experiment, the normal alkyl halide is used, and the reaction rate constant is measured as $k_H$. In the second experiment, an isotopically labeled analog is used, where the specific C-H bond in question has been replaced by a carbon-deuterium (C-D) bond. The student calculates the Kinetic Isotope Effect (KIE), defined as the ratio $k_H/k_D$, and finds its value to be 1.03.\n\nBased on this experimental KIE value, which of the following conclusions about the role of the labeled C-H bond in the rate-determining step of the reaction is the most plausible?\n\nA.

The carbon atom of the C-H bond undergoes rehybridization from an sp2 geometry in the reactant to an sp3 geometry in the transition state.\n\nC.

The C-H bond is located far from the reaction center and its vibrational frequencies are not substantially altered in the transition state compared to the reactant state.\n\nE. The experiment is flawed, as any isotopic substitution must result in a KIE value significantly different from 1.", "solution": "We consider the kinetic isotope effect under transition state theory. For a given isotopologue, the rate constant can be written as\n$$\nk=\\kappa \\frac{k_{B}T}{h}\\frac{Q^{\\ddagger}}{Q_{R}}\\exp\\!\\left(-\\frac{\\Delta E^{\\ddagger}}{k_{B}T}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $\\kappa$ is the transmission coefficient, $Q^{\\ddagger}$ and $Q_{R}$ are the partition functions of the transition state and reactant, respectively, and $\\Delta E^{\\ddagger}$ is the potential energy barrier.

The difference in zero-point energy changes between reactant and transition state shifts the effective activation energy by an amount that enters the exponential factor above. When a C−H bond is directly broken in the rate-determining transition state (primary isotope effect), the C−H stretching mode present in the reactant is largely absent or strongly softened in the transition state, producing a substantial difference between $\\Delta E^{\\ddagger}_{H}$ and $\\Delta E^{\\ddagger}_{D}$ and often yielding $k_{H}/k_{D}$ significantly greater than 1, commonly in the range of approximately 2 to 8 at ambient temperature. Therefore, an observed $k_{H}/k_{D}=1.03$ is far too small to be consistent with cleavage of the labeled C−H bond in the rate-determining step, so option A is not plausible.\n\nIf the labeled C−H bond is not broken but the carbon center changes hybridization, the effect is a secondary isotope effect arising from changes in bending and stretching force constants and couplings in going from reactant to transition state. A change from sp3 in the reactant to sp2 in the transition state typically gives a normal secondary kinetic isotope effect, $k_{H}/k_{D}1$, because increased s-character stiffens certain vibrational modes, raising $\\omega$ for H more than for D in the transition state relative to the reactant. These normal secondary effects are often noticeably larger than unity (frequently around 1.1), reflecting a discernible shift in vibrational frequencies. Thus option C would usually produce a KIE appreciably above 1, larger than 1.03, making C less plausible given the very small observed effect.\n\nConversely, a change from sp2 in the reactant to sp3 in the transition state generally yields an inverse secondary KIE, $k_{H}/k_{D}1$, owing to the opposite direction of the vibrational frequency changes. Therefore, option B would tend to give a value below 1 rather than the observed 1.03, and is not consistent with the data.\n\nA KIE very close to unity, such as 1.03, is characteristic of either a very small secondary isotope effect or an isotope substitution remote from the reaction center that does not substantially perturb the relevant vibrational modes in the transition state compared to the reactant. In such a case, both the partition function ratio and the zero-point energy difference between isotopologues change only minimally, so\n$$\n\\frac{k_{H}}{k_{D}}\\approx 1,\n$$\nwith small deviations such as 1.03 being entirely plausible. Therefore, the most consistent conclusion is that the labeled C−H bond is far from the reaction center and experiences little to no vibrational change in the transition state relative to the reactant, corresponding to option D.\n\nFinally, the assertion that any isotopic substitution must yield a KIE significantly different from 1 is incorrect; if the labeled site is not involved in the rate-determining coordinate and its vibrational environment changes negligibly, $k_{H}/k_{D}$ can be very close to 1. Hence option E is not valid.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible conclusion given $k_{H}/k_{D}=1.03$ is option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "1988348"}, {"introduction": "Kinetic isotope effects are intrinsically linked to a reaction's activation energy and, by extension, its dependence on temperature as described by the Arrhenius equation.
