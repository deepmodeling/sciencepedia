This surfactant forms spherical micelles in an aqueous solution, which can encapsulate hydrophobic drug molecules. A stock solution is prepared by dissolving the surfactant in water to a total concentration of $0.050$ M. Experimental measurements have determined that the Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC) for this surfactant under the given conditions is $0.008$ M. Above the CMC, the additional surfactant molecules aggregate to form micelles, while the concentration of free, unassociated surfactant monomers in the solution remains approximately constant at the CMC value. Further analysis using light scattering reveals that each micelle is, on average, composed of 80 surfactant molecules; this is known as the average aggregation number.\n\nAssuming the model described is accurate, calculate the total number of individual micelles present in a $100.0$ mL sample of this surfactant solution.

Therefore, the concentration of surfactant incorporated into micelles (expressed in monomer units) is the excess over the CMC, and the concentration of micelles (as particles) is that excess divided by the aggregation number.

This practice challenges you to think qualitatively about how changes in molecular architecture—specifically, chain branching—affect the packing efficiency and stability of micelles, thus influencing the CMC [@problem_id:1992386]. Understanding these structure-property relationships is key to designing surfactants for specific applications.", "problem": "In the study of colloid and surface chemistry, a surfactant is an amphiphilic molecule containing both a hydrophobic tail and a hydrophilic head. In aqueous solutions, above a certain concentration, surfactant molecules self-assemble into aggregates called micelles. This process is driven primarily by the hydrophobic effect, which seeks to minimize the contact between the hydrophobic tails and water. The specific concentration at which this self-assembly begins is known as the Critical Micelle Concentration (CMC).\n\nConsider two different anionic surfactants, Surfactant L and Surfactant B, dissolved in pure water at the same temperature.\n- Surfactant L possesses a hydrophilic sulfate head group attached to a straight, unbranched C12 alkyl chain (dodecyl).\n- Surfactant B possesses the same hydrophilic sulfate head group, but it is attached to a branched C12 alkyl chain. The branching makes the tail bulkier but does not change its overall chemical formula (i.e., it is an isomer of the C12 alkyl group).\n\nBased on the fundamental principles of molecular self-assembly, how would you expect the CMC of Surfactant B to compare to the CMC of Surfactant L?\n\nA. The CMC of Surfactant B will be higher than the CMC of Surfactant L.\n\nB. The CMC of Surfactant B will be lower than the CMC of Surfactant L.\n\nC. The CMC of both surfactants will be identical because their hydrophobic tails contain the same number of carbon atoms.\n\nD. It is impossible to predict the relative CMC without knowing the specific position of the branching in Surfactant B.\n\nE. Surfactant B is too bulky to form micelles, so it does not have a measurable CMC.", "solution": "Define the micellization equilibrium for aggregation number $m$ as $m\\,\\mathrm{S} \\rightleftharpoons \\mathrm{S}_{m}$. The condition for the onset of micellization (the CMC) can be expressed by equality of the chemical potential of a monomer in bulk solution and the chemical potential per monomer in the micelle.

For Surfactant B (branched C12), branching increases steric bulk near the interface, which increases $a_{0}$ and decreases effective $l_{c}$; while $v$ may increase slightly, the net effect is to increase both $\\gamma a_{0}$ and $f_{\\mathrm{pack}}$. The hydrophobic transfer term $\\mu_{\\mathrm{hyd}}$ is primarily determined by carbon number and is thus similar for the two isomers, so the dominant difference is the packing penalty.\n\nTherefore,\n$$\n\\Delta\\mu^{\\circ}_{B}>\\Delta\\mu^{\\circ}_{L}\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad \\ln c_{\\mathrm{CMC},B}>\\ln c_{\\mathrm{CMC},L}\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad c_{\\mathrm{CMC},B}>c_{\\mathrm{CMC},L}.\n$$\nConsequently, the branched surfactant has a higher CMC than the linear isomer, consistent with the fundamental packing and interfacial arguments (often summarized via the packing parameter $p=v/(a_{0}l_{c})$, which decreases with branching, increasing the free-energy cost per chain in the micelle).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1992386"}, {"introduction": "Micelle formation is a thermodynamically driven process, and its equilibrium is sensitive to changes in temperature.
