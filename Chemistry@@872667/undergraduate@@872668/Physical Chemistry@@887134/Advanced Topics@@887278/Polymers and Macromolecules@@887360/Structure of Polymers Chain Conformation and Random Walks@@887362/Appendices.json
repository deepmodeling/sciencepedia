For an ideal freely jointed chain, the root-mean-square end-to-end distance scales as\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\langle R^2 \\rangle} \\propto \\sqrt{N},\n$$\nwhere $N$ is the number of monomer units.

I have also found an error in problem 1 solution. It uses $n_b = 2N-1$ and then $n_b \\approx 2N$. But for polyethylene from ethylene monomers, the number of C-C bonds is exactly $2N$ if you consider the full backbone formed. A chain of $N$ ethylene units `(-CH2-CH2-)` has $2N$ backbone carbons and $2N$ backbone bonds, with two dangling bonds at the ends. Or if it's C-C-C... then it's $2N-1$. But the unit is specified. Let's assume the simple $2N$ is what is meant. The original solution is also a bit confusing, stating $2N-1$ and then showing it doesn't matter. I will simplify it to use $n_b=2N$ which is more standard for long chains and for this monomer. The original used $2N-1$ and got 384.846 which rounds to 385. Using $2N$ gives exactly 385. This is a simplification and clarification.\n\nGiven the error in problem 3 is so fundamental, I will lower the score from 8 to 6.

The derivation `$\\langle R_g^2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{6} N l^2 = \\frac{1}{6} N \\left(\\frac{L}{N}\\right)^2 = \\frac{L^2}{6N}$` is mathematically correct but confusing. A clearer form is `$\\langle R_g^2 \\rangle = \\frac{1}{6} N l^2 = \\frac{1}{6} (Nl)l = \\frac{Ll}{6}$`. I'll make this change. It's much more intuitive.\n- `applications`: `$\\langle R^2 \\rangle / R_g^2 = 6$` should be `$\\langle R^2 \\rangle / \\langle R_g^2 \\rangle = 6$`.
