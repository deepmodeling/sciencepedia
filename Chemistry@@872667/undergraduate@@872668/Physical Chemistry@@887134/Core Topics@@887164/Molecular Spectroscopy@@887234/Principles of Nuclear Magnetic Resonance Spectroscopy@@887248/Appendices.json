This splitting of a single resonance into multiple lines arises from a phenomenon called spin-spin coupling, where the magnetic field of one nucleus influences its neighbors. For many common organic molecules, we can predict this splitting pattern using the simple `$n+1$` rule.

A key aspect of interpreting a proton ($^{1}\\text{H}$) NMR spectrum is understanding spin-spin coupling, which causes the resonance signal of a proton to split into multiple peaks. For systems exhibiting first-order coupling, this splitting pattern, known as the signal's multiplicity, can be predicted by the `$n+1$` rule.
