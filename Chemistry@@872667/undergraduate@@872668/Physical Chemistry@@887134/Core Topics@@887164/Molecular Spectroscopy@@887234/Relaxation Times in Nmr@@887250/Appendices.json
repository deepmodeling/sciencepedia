For a proton with gyromagnetic ratio $\\gamma$ in a static magnetic field $B_{0}$, the Larmor angular frequency is $\\omega_{0} = \\gamma B_{0}$. In the standard Bloembergen-Purcell-Pound framework for isotropic rotational motion characterized by a single correlation time $\\tau_{c}$, the relaxation rate has the form\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T_{1}} \\propto J(\\omega_{0}) + 4 J(2 \\omega_{0}),\n$$\nwhere the spectral density can be modeled as\n$$\nJ(\\omega) \\propto \\frac{\\tau_{c}}{1 + \\omega^{2} \\tau_{c}^{2}}.\n$$\nFrom this, two limiting regimes follow:\n1) Extreme narrowing (fast motion), $\\omega_{0} \\tau_{c} \\ll 1$: then $J(\\omega) \\propto \\tau_{c}$ and hence $1/T_{1} \\propto \\tau_{c}$, so $T_{1}$ decreases as $\\tau_{c}$ increases within this regime.\n2) Slow-motion (rigid lattice), $\\omega_{0} \\tau_{c} \\gg 1$: then $J(\\omega) \\propto (\\omega^{2} \\tau_{c})^{-1}$ and hence $1/T_{1} \\propto (\\omega_{0}^{2} \\tau_{c})^{-1}$, so $T_{1}$ increases with $\\tau_{c}$ in this regime.\n\nApplying these principles to the three systems:\n- System A (liquid water at ambient temperature) has very fast molecular reorientation with small $\\tau_{c}$, typically in or near the extreme narrowing regime. Therefore $1/T_{1}$ is finite and governed by $1/T_{1} \\propto \\tau_{c}$, giving a moderate $T_{1}$.\n- System B (ice at a subzero temperature) behaves as a rigid lattice with very large effective $\\tau_{c}$ such that $\\omega_{0} \\tau_{c} \\gg 1$. In this slow-motion limit, $J(\\omega_{0})$ is small, so $1/T_{1}$ is small and $T_{1}$ becomes long. Thus $T_{1,B}$ is longer than $T_{1,A}$.\n- System C (water with a paramagnetic solute) has an additional paramagnetic relaxation contribution. The total relaxation rate is additive,\n$$\n\\frac{1}{T_{1,\\text{total}}} = \\frac{1}{T_{1,\\text{dia}}} + \\frac{1}{T_{1,\\text{para}}},\n$$\nwhere the paramagnetic term arises from coupling to unpaired electron spins of the gadolinium ions. Because the electron magnetic moment is much larger than the nuclear magnetic moment, the paramagnetic contribution has a large prefactor (proportional to the square of the electron magnetic moment and to $S(S+1)$ of the electron spin) and strongly enhances $1/T_{1}$. Consequently $T_{1}$ is drastically shortened in the presence of $Gd^{3+}$, so $T_{1,C}$ is the shortest among the three.\n\nCombining these comparisons yields the ordering\n$$\nT_{1,C} < T_{1,A} < T_{1,B},\n$$\nwhich corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2002760"}, {"introduction": "Moving from qualitative reasoning to quantitative analysis, we now explore one of the most common pulse sequences for measuring the spin-lattice relaxation time: the inversion recovery experiment.
