For an ideal binary solution, the total vapor pressure is given by Raoult's Law, which states that the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of the components. The partial pressure of each component is its mole fraction in the liquid phase multiplied by the vapor pressure of the pure component at that temperature.\n$$ P_{total} = x_C P^*_C + x_D P^*_D $$\nwhere $x_C$ and $x_D$ are the mole fractions of Corvanol and Dexane, and $P^*_C$ and $P^*_D$ are the vapor pressures of the pure components.\n\nSince this is a binary mixture, the mole fractions must sum to one: $x_C + x_D = 1$.

We are looking for the value of $T_b$ such that $f(T_b) = 101.325$.\n\nTo start the iteration, we can find the boiling points of the pure components to establish a range for $T_b$.\nFor pure Corvanol ($x_C=1$): $101.325 = \\exp(15.00 - 3000/T_{b,C}) \\implies \\ln(101.325) = 15.00 - 3000/T_{b,C}$.\n$4.6183 = 15.00 - 3000/T_{b,C} \\implies T_{b,C} = 3000 / (15.00 - 4.6183) \\approx 288.97$ K.\nFor pure Dexane ($x_C=0$): $101.325 = \\exp(16.00 - 4000/T_{b,D}) \\implies \\ln(101.325) = 16.00 - 4000/T_{b,D}$.\n$4.6183 = 16.00 - 4000/T_{b,D} \\implies T_{b,D} = 4000 / (16.00 - 4.6183) \\approx 351.45$ K.\nThe boiling point of our mixture must lie between these two values: $288.97 \\text{ K} < T_b < 351.45 \\text{ K}$.\n\nLet's test a value, say $T=300$ K:\n$f(300) = 0.60 \\exp(15.00 - 3000/300) + 0.40 \\exp(16.00 - 4000/300)$\n$f(300) = 0.60 \\exp(5) + 0.40 \\exp(16 - 13.333) = 0.60(148.41) + 0.40(14.39) = 89.05 + 5.76 = 94.81$ kPa.\nThis is too low, so the boiling point must be higher than 300 K.\n\nLet's try $T=305$ K:\n$f(305) = 0.60 \\exp(15.00 - 3000/305) + 0.40 \\exp(16.00 - 4000/305)$\n$f(305) = 0.60 \\exp(15.00 - 9.836) + 0.40 \\exp(16.00 - 13.115) = 0.60 \\exp(5.164) + 0.40 \\exp(2.885)$\n$f(305) = 0.60(174.86) + 0.40(17.90) = 104.92 + 7.16 = 112.08$ kPa.\nThis is too high.
