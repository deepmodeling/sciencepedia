This effect, known as electron shielding or screening, reduces the attraction between the nucleus and the outermost electron, making it easier to remove. A quantitative estimate of this shielding can be made using a set of empirical guidelines known as Slater's rules.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, use the following version of Slater's rules to determine the screening constant, $S$:\n1.  Write the electron configuration of the atom and group the orbitals as follows: (1s), (2s, 2p), (3s, 3p), (3d), (4s, 4p), (4d), (4f), (5s, 5p), etc.\n2.  For an electron in an ns or np orbital of interest:\n    a. Electrons in any group with a principal quantum number higher than that of the electron of interest contribute 0 to $S$.\n    b. Each of the other electrons in the same (ns, np) group contributes 0.35 to $S$.\n    c. Electrons in the shell with principal quantum number (n-1) contribute 0.85 each to $S$.\n    d. Electrons in shells with principal quantum number (n-2) or lower contribute 1.00 each to $S$.\n\nThe effective nuclear charge is then calculated as $Z_{\\text{eff}} = Z - S$, where $Z$ is the actual nuclear charge (the atomic number).\n\nConsider a neutral potassium atom (atomic number $Z=19$). Calculate the fraction of the total nuclear charge that is screened from its outermost valence electron.

The valence electron of interest is in the $4s$ orbital, which lies in the $(4s,4p)$ group per the given grouping.\n\nApplying the provided Slater's rules for an $ns$ or $np$ electron with $n=4$:\n- Electrons in higher groups than $n=4$ contribute $0$ by rule (a); there are none.\n- Other electrons in the same $(4s,4p)$ group contribute $0.35$ each by rule (b). Here, there are $0$ such electrons, so this contribution is $0$.\n- Electrons in the $n-1=3$ shell contribute $0.85$ each by rule (c).
