By determining the ground-state term symbol for a neutral carbon atom, you will practice handling equivalent electrons in a simple $p^2$ configuration.

This compact notation encodes the total spin angular momentum quantum number ($S$), the total orbital angular momentum quantum number ($L$), and the total angular momentum quantum number ($J$) for the entire atom. These quantum numbers are crucial for understanding atomic spectroscopy and selection rules for electronic transitions.\n\nConsider a neutral carbon atom in its ground electronic state. The electronic configuration of carbon is $1s^2 2s^2 2p^2$. The term symbol is determined by the electrons in the outermost, partially filled subshell, as the total angular momenta for completely filled shells and subshells are zero. The value of the total orbital angular momentum quantum number $L$ is conventionally represented by an uppercase letter: S for $L=0$, P for $L=1$, D for $L=2$, F for $L=3$, and so on alphabetically.\n\nYour task is to determine the set of three quantum numbers $(S, L, J)$ that specifies the ground state term symbol for a neutral carbon atom.\n\nExpress your answer as a row matrix containing the three numerical values in the order S, L, J.", "solution": "The ground-state electronic configuration of neutral carbon is $1s^2 2s^2 2p^2$. Completely filled subshells ($1s^2$ and $2s^2$) contribute zero total orbital and spin angular momentum, so only the partially filled $2p^2$ subshell determines the term. Each $2p$ electron has $l=1$ and $s=\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nStep 1: Determine possible total spin $S$ and orbital $L$ for two equivalent $p$ electrons.\n- Spin coupling: Two spins $s=\\frac{1}{2}$ combine to $S=1$ (triplet, symmetric spin) or $S=0$ (singlet, antisymmetric spin).\n- Orbital coupling: Two $l=1$ electrons combine to $L=2,1,0$.\n\nBecause the two electrons are equivalent, the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric under particle exchange (Pauli principle). The spatial part for two identical $l=1$ electrons has exchange symmetry $(-1)^{L}$: even $L$ gives a symmetric spatial function and odd $L$ gives an antisymmetric spatial function. To make the overall wavefunction antisymmetric:\n- For symmetric spatial part (even $L=0,2$), the spin part must be antisymmetric, so $S=0$ is allowed with $L=0$ and $L=2$.\n- For antisymmetric spatial part (odd $L=1$), the spin part must be symmetric, so $S=1$ is allowed only with $L=1$.\n\nThus the allowed terms for $2p^{2}$ are $^{1}S$, $^{1}D$, and $^{3}P$, corresponding to $(S,L)=(0,0)$, $(0,2)$, and $(1,1)$, respectively.\n\nStep 2: Apply Hund’s rules to identify the ground term.\n- Hund’s first rule: The term with maximum $S$ lies lowest. Hence the ground term must be the triplet, $^{3}P$, with $S=1$ and $L=1$.\n- Hund’s second rule: For a given $S$, the term with maximum $L$ is lowest. Among triplets for $p^{2}$, only $L=1$ exists, so $^{3}P$ remains the ground term candidate.\n- Hund’s third rule: For a subshell less than half filled (here, $p$ can hold $6$ electrons, and we have $23$), the level with the smallest $J$ is lowest in energy.\n\nStep 3: Determine $J$ for the $^{3}P$ term.\nFor $L=1$ and $S=1$, the possible $J$ values are given by vector coupling:\n$$\nJ=L+S,\\,L+S-1,\\,\\ldots,\\,|L-S| \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad J=2,\\,1,\\,0.\n$$\nBy Hund’s third rule for a less-than-half-filled subshell, the lowest $J$ is the ground level, so $J=0$.\n\nTherefore, the ground-state term is $^{3}P_{0}$, corresponding to the quantum numbers $(S,L,J)=(1,1,0)$.\n\nThe required row matrix is $\\begin{pmatrix}1  1  0\\end{pmatrix}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}1  1  0\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "1373346"}, {"introduction": "Building on the basics, this practice explores the application of Hund's rules to transition metal ions, which are central to fields like magnetism and catalysis.

A $d$ subshell has $l=2$ with $m_{l}\\in\\{-2,-1,0,1,2\\}$, so there are five spatial orbitals. For $d^{7}$, Hund’s first rule (maximize total spin) fills the five orbitals with parallel spins and places the remaining two electrons paired (opposite spin) in two of those orbitals due to the Pauli principle. Thus there are three unpaired electrons. The total spin is\n$$\nS=3\\cdot \\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{3}{2},\n$$\nso the multiplicity is $2S+1=4$.\n\nSecond, determine the total orbital angular momentum $L$ for this maximum-spin manifold by maximizing $M_{L}$ among microstates with $M_{S}=S$. Place the five spin-up electrons in $m_{l}=2,1,0,-1,-2$, whose $m_{l}$ sum is $0$. To maximize $M_{L}$, place the two spin-down electrons in $m_{l}=2$ and $m_{l}=1$ (pairing is allowed with opposite spin). Then\n$$\nM_{L}^{\\max}=(2+1+0+(-1)+(-2))+(2+1)=0+3=3.\n$$\nThe term’s $L$ equals this maximum $M_{L}$, hence $L=3$, corresponding to an $F$ term.\n\nThird, apply Hund’s third rule to find $J$. Since $d^{7}$ is more than half-filled (the $d$ subshell holds $10$ electrons and half-filled is $d^{5}$), the level with the largest $J$ lies lowest, so\n$$\nJ=L+S=3+\\frac{3}{2}=\\frac{9}{2}.\n$$\n\nTherefore, the ground-state term symbol is\n$$\n{}^{2S+1}L_{J}={}^4F_{9/2},\n$$\nwhich corresponds to option A.
