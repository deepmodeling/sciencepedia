This foundational skill allows us to correlate the number of electron domains with a specific set of hybrid orbitals, which in turn determines the molecule's basic geometry. This practice exercise challenges you to apply these core principles to determine the hybridization of aluminum in gaseous aluminum chloride, a key industrial catalyst. [@problem_id:1999789]", "problem": "Aluminum chloride is a compound with significant industrial importance, acting as a potent Lewis acid catalyst in reactions like the Friedel-Crafts acylation. In the solid state, it adopts a crystalline lattice structure, and in the liquid and vapor phases near its boiling point, it exists primarily as a dimer, $Al_2Cl_6$. However, at very high temperatures (above 800 °C), thermal dissociation becomes significant, yielding a substantial population of gaseous, monomeric $AlCl_3$ molecules.\n\nConsider a single, isolated molecule of aluminum chloride ($AlCl_3$) in the gas phase. Based on the principles of valence bond theory and orbital hybridization, determine the hybridization state of the central aluminum atom. The atomic number of Aluminum (Al) is 13, and the atomic number of Chlorine (Cl) is 17. Which of the following describes the hybridization of the aluminum atom?\n\nA. $sp$\nB. $sp^2$\nC. $sp^3$\nD. $sp^3d$\nE. $sp^3d^2$", "solution": "We consider a single, isolated gaseous $\\text{AlCl}_3$ molecule (monomer). The central atom is aluminum. The valence electron configuration of aluminum is $[\\text{Ne}]\\,3s^2 3p^1$, giving $3$ valence electrons. Each chlorine has a valence configuration $[\\text{Ne}]\\,3s^2 3p^5$ and contributes one unpaired $3p$ electron for bonding.\n\nAccording to valence bond theory, to form three equivalent $\\sigma$ bonds with the three chlorine atoms, the aluminum atom must provide three equivalent, singly occupied orbitals directed toward the three chlorines. This is achieved by hybridizing one $3s$ and two $3p$ orbitals to form three $sp^2$ hybrid orbitals. Conceptually, an electron from $3s$ is redistributed to give an effective $3s^1 3p^2$ occupation before hybridization, so that after $sp^2$ hybridization there are three singly occupied $sp^2$ hybrids available to overlap with the singly occupied $3p$ orbitals of the three chlorine atoms to form three $\\sigma$ bonds.\n\nVSEPR reasoning is consistent: the central aluminum has $3$ regions of $\\sigma$ bonding electron density and no lone pairs, which gives a trigonal planar arrangement and hence $sp^2$ hybridization. The remaining unhybridized $3p$ orbital on aluminum is empty and is oriented perpendicular to the molecular plane; this empty orbital accounts for the strong Lewis acidity of $\\text{AlCl}_3$ and its tendency to accept electron density or dimerize at lower temperatures.\n\nThe alternative hybridizations are inconsistent with the observed and predicted coordination: $sp$ would imply only $2$ electron domains (linear), $sp^3$ would require $4$ electron domains (tetrahedral), and $sp^3d$ or $sp^3d^2$ would correspond to $5$ or $6$ electron domains, none of which applies to a three-coordinate, trigonal planar $\\text{AlCl}_3$ monomer.
