We will do this by tracking the number of moles of each species.\n\nLet's assume we start with an initial amount of $n_0$ moles of pure $SO_2Cl_2$ and zero moles of the products. The degree of dissociation, $\\alpha$, is the fraction of the initial $SO_2Cl_2$ that decomposes. Therefore, at equilibrium, the number of moles of $SO_2Cl_2$ that have reacted is $n_0 \\alpha$.\n\nThe stoichiometry of the reaction $SO_2Cl_2(g) \\rightleftharpoons SO_2(g) + Cl_2(g)$ is 1:1:1. So, for every mole of $SO_2Cl_2$ that decomposes, one mole of $SO_2$ and one mole of $Cl_2$ are formed.\n\nWe can express the number of moles of each species at equilibrium:\n- Moles of $SO_2Cl_2$ at equilibrium: $n_{SO_2Cl_2} = n_0 - n_0 \\alpha = n_0(1-\\alpha)$\n- Moles of $SO_2$ at equilibrium: $n_{SO_2} = 0 + n_0 \\alpha = n_0 \\alpha$\n- Moles of $Cl_2$ at equilibrium: $n_{Cl_2} = 0 + n_0 \\alpha = n_0 \\alpha$\n\nNext, we find the total number of moles of gas in the container at equilibrium, $n_{total}$, by summing the moles of all species:\n$$n_{total} = n_{SO_2Cl_2} + n_{SO_2} + n_{Cl_2}$$\n$$n_{total} = n_0(1-\\alpha) + n_0 \\alpha + n_0 \\alpha = n_0(1 - \\alpha + \\alpha + \\alpha) = n_0(1+\\alpha)$$\n\nNow, we can calculate the mole fraction, $X_i$, for each component.
