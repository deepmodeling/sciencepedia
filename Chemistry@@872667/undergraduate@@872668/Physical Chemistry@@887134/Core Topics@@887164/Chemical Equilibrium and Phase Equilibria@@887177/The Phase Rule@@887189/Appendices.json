For a reacting system, the number of components is calculated as $C = S - R$, where $S$ is the number of chemical species and $R$ is the number of independent reactions.

The system contains water, glycerol, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Although glycerol and DMSO are effectively non-volatile and thus absent from the vapor phase, they are still components because the number of components is the minimum number of chemically independent species needed to describe the composition of all phases in the system.

This problem examines a binary alloy system held at a constant pressure, a scenario common in metallurgy and materials science. This practice introduces the essential concept of the condensed phase rule, $F' = C - P + 1$, demonstrating how fixing an intensive variable reduces the system's variance and is key to interpreting the temperature-composition phase diagrams that are cornerstones of materials engineering.

The entire experimental investigation is conducted in a furnace that maintains a constant ambient pressure. The scientist observes that at a particular temperature, the system becomes invariant, meaning it possesses zero degrees of freedom. At this specific invariant point, a liquid phase is found to be in equilibrium with one or more solid phases. Given that the number of components in the system is two, determine the total number of phases coexisting in equilibrium at this invariant point.", "solution": "The problem asks for the number of phases present in a two-component system at an invariant point under constant pressure. The governing principle for this scenario is the Gibbs Phase Rule.\n\nThe standard form of the Gibbs Phase Rule is given by:\n$$F = C - P + 2$$\nwhere:\n- $F$ is the number of degrees of freedom (variance) of the system. This represents the number of intensive variables (like temperature, pressure, or composition) that can be changed independently without altering the number of phases in equilibrium.\n- $C$ is the number of components, which are the chemically independent constituents of the system.\n- $P$ is the number of phases, which are the homogeneous, physically distinct parts of the system.\n\nThe `+2` term in the standard equation accounts for the two intensive variables that are typically considered: temperature and pressure.\n\nIn this problem, a crucial constraint is given: the experiment is conducted at a constant pressure. This means that pressure is not a variable that can be changed independently. Consequently, one degree of freedom is already fixed. When one intensive variable is held constant, we use a modified version of the phase rule, often called the condensed phase rule. This is derived by subtracting 1 from the standard rule to account for the fixed variable:\n$$F' = C - P + 1$$\nHere, $F'$ represents the number of degrees of freedom under the specified constraint (constant pressure).\n\nWe are given the following information from the problem statement:\n- The system is invariant, which means the number of degrees of freedom is zero. So, $F' = 0$.\n- The system is a binary alloy, meaning it has two components. So, $C = 2$.\n\nNow, we can substitute these values into the condensed phase rule equation to solve for $P$, the number of phases.\n$$0 = 2 - P + 1$$\n$$0 = 3 - P$$\nRearranging the equation to solve for $P$:\n$$P = 3$$\n\nTherefore, for a two-component system at constant pressure to be invariant, there must be exactly three phases in equilibrium. These phases could be, for example, two solid phases and one liquid phase (a eutectic or peritectic point), or one solid phase, one liquid phase and a vapor phase, although in metallic systems at atmospheric pressure, the vapor phase is often ignored. The problem states that a liquid phase is in equilibrium with solid phases, which is consistent with this result (e.g., two solids and one liquid).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{3}$$", "id": "2017449"}, {"introduction": "This final practice moves beyond simple external constraints to explore the full power and subtlety of the Phase Rule. The hypothetical scenario described involves a saturated solution, but with a unique twist: the saturating solid phase is not physically present. This problem challenges you to apply the generalized phase rule, $F = C - P + 2 - r$, by identifying a special compositional constraint ($r$), illustrating how the rule elegantly accounts for any imposed relationship among the system's intensive variables.

The degrees of freedom represent the number of independent intensive variables (such as temperature, pressure, or concentration) that can be varied without changing the number of phases.\n\nThis form of the rule assumes that the only constraints on the system are the conditions of thermal, mechanical, and chemical equilibrium between the phases. However, if additional constraints are imposed on the system, the number of degrees of freedom is reduced. The generalized Gibbs Phase Rule is given by $F = C - P + 2 - r$, where $r$ is the number of such additional constraints or special relations among the intensive variables.\n\nConsider a system composed of two non-reacting chemical components: a volatile solvent (component A) and a non-volatile solute (component B). These components form a binary liquid solution. This solution is in equilibrium with its vapor phase, which consists purely of component A due to the non-volatility of B. A special condition is imposed on the system: the liquid solution is maintained at its saturation concentration with respect to the solute B at the prevailing temperature and pressure. It is important to note that no solid phase of B is physically present in the system; the solution is simply saturated.\n\nBased on this description, derive the number of degrees of freedom, $F$, for this specific system.", "solution": "1.
