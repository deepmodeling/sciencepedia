This exercise [@problem_id:2254217] challenges you to qualitatively compare the lattice energies of two ionic oxides by applying the fundamental principles of electrostatics. By reasoning about the effects of ionic charge and size, you will develop an intuition for the factors that govern the stability of ionic crystals, which are quantitatively described by models like the Kapustinskii equation.", "problem": "Metal oxides are a critical class of materials used in applications ranging from ceramics to catalysts, where their high-temperature stability is paramount. The thermal stability of an ionic oxide is strongly correlated with its lattice energy—the energy released when gaseous ions combine to form one mole of a solid ionic compound. A more exothermic (more negative) lattice energy generally indicates a more stable crystal lattice.\n\nConsider two metal oxides: potassium oxide ($\\text{K}_2\\text{O}$) and calcium oxide ($\\text{CaO}$). Based on the fundamental principles governing electrostatic interactions in an ionic lattice, and without performing any calculations, select the option that correctly identifies which compound is expected to have a higher magnitude of lattice energy and provides the most complete reasoning.\n\nA. $\\text{K}_2\\text{O}$, because the potassium ion ($K^+$) is larger than the calcium ion ($Ca^{2+}$), which reduces repulsion.\n\nB. $\\text{K}_2\\text{O}$, because its formula unit contains two cations, leading to more electrostatic attractions per formula unit.\n\nC. $\\text{CaO}$, because the magnitude of the ionic charges ($+2$ and $-2$) is greater than in $\\text{K}_2\\text{O}$ ($+1$ and $-2$).\n\nD. $\\text{CaO}$, because the calcium ion ($Ca^{2+}$) is smaller than the potassium ion ($K^+$), leading to a smaller internuclear distance.\n\nE. $\\text{CaO}$, for the combined reasons that the ionic charges have a greater magnitude and the cation is smaller.\n\nF. The lattice energies are expected to be very similar because both compounds contain the same oxide anion ($O^{2-}$).", "solution": "Lattice energy for an ionic crystal can be modeled by the Born–Landé expression, which captures the dominant electrostatic interactions and short-range repulsion:\n$$\nU = -\\frac{N_{A} M z_{+} z_{-} e^{2}}{4 \\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r_{0}}\\left(1-\\frac{1}{n}\\right),\n$$\nwhere $N_{A}$ is Avogadro’s number, $M$ is the Madelung constant determined by the lattice geometry, $z_{+}$ and $z_{-}$ are the ionic charges, $e$ is the elementary charge, $\\varepsilon_{0}$ is the vacuum permittivity, $r_{0}$ is the nearest-neighbor cation–anion separation, and $n$ is the Born exponent describing repulsion. The magnitude of $U$ increases with larger $|z_{+} z_{-}|$ and smaller $r_{0}$, all else equal.\n\nFor $\\text{K}_{2}\\text{O}$, the ions are $K^{+}$ and $O^{2-}$, so $|z_{+} z_{-}|=2$. For $\\text{CaO}$, the ions are $Ca^{2+}$ and $O^{2-}$, so $|z_{+} z_{-}|=4$. Thus, the electrostatic attraction term proportional to $|z_{+} z_{-}|/r_{0}$ is larger in magnitude for $\\text{CaO}$ than for $\\text{K}_{2}\\text{O}$ due to the higher ionic charge product.\n\nNext, consider $r_{0}$. The cation–anion separation $r_{0}$ is approximately the sum of the ionic radii. Between $K^{+}$ and $Ca^{2+}$, $Ca^{2+}$ is smaller than $K^{+}$ because both are isoelectronic with a noble gas configuration, but $Ca^{2+}$ has a higher nuclear charge attracting the same number of electrons more strongly. Therefore, $r_{0}$ is smaller in $\\text{CaO}$ than in $\\text{K}_{2}\\text{O}$, which further increases the magnitude of the lattice energy for $\\text{CaO}$.\n\nTherefore, both principal factors governing lattice energy in the Born–Landé model favor $\\text{CaO}$: it has a larger ionic charge product and a smaller nearest-neighbor distance. Options citing only one of these effects (charges alone or size alone) are incomplete. Arguments based on “more cations per formula unit” do not correctly reflect the dependence of $U$ on $z_{+} z_{-}$ and $r_{0}$, and the presence of the same anion does not make the lattice energies similar because cation charge and size differ substantially.\n\nHence, the correct and most complete reasoning is that $\\text{CaO}$ has the higher magnitude of lattice energy due to both the higher ionic charges and the smaller cation size.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{E}$$", "id": "2254217"}, {"introduction": "The Born-Haber cycle is a powerful application of Hess's Law, allowing us to calculate lattice enthalpies or enthalpies of formation that are difficult to measure directly.
