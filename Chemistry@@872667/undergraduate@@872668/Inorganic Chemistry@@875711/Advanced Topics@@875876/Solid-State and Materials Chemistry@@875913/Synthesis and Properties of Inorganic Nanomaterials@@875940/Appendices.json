Consider two distinct, common synthetic routes for preparing CdS QDs.\n\n**Method 1:** A \"hot-injection\" organometallic route. This synthesis is performed at a high temperature (typically above 200 °C) in a high-boiling point, nonpolar organic solvent like octadecene. The precursors for this method must be soluble and reactive in this nonpolar medium.\n\n**Method 2:** An aqueous precipitation route. This synthesis is performed at or near room temperature in water.

The key to solving this problem is to match the solubility and reactivity of the precursors with the conditions of each method.\n\nLet's analyze the requirements for each method.\n\n**Analysis of Method 1 (High-Temperature, Nonpolar Organic Solvent):**\nThis method is carried out in a nonpolar solvent (like octadecene) at high temperatures. Therefore, the precursors must be soluble in this nonpolar environment.\n- **Cadmium Precursor:** Simple inorganic salts like CdCl₂ are ionic and insoluble in nonpolar organic solvents. A common strategy is to use a cadmium source that can be rendered soluble. Cadmium oxide (CdO), while itself an insoluble solid, reacts with long-chain fatty acids like oleic acid at high temperatures to form a cadmium-carboxylate complex, such as cadmium oleate. This complex is soluble in nonpolar solvents like octadecene and serves as the molecular precursor for cadmium.\n- **Sulfur Precursor:** A source of sulfur that is soluble in a hot nonpolar solvent is needed. Elemental sulfur (often in its S₈ crown form) can be dissolved in hot octadecene. This solution can then be injected to react with the cadmium precursor. Alternatively, sulfur can be complexed with an organic ligand, like in trioctylphosphine sulfide (TOP-S), to enhance its solubility and control its reactivity.\n- **Conclusion for Method 1:** A suitable precursor set is Cadmium oxide (CdO) combined with oleic acid (to form the soluble complex in-situ) and elemental sulfur (dissolved in the reaction solvent).\n\n**Analysis of Method 2 (Low-Temperature, Aqueous Solvent):**\nThis method is carried out in water at or near room temperature. The precursors must be soluble in water (hydrophilic) to form a homogeneous solution from which CdS can precipitate.\n- **Cadmium Precursor:** A simple, water-soluble cadmium salt is ideal. Cadmium chloride (CdCl₂), cadmium nitrate (Cd(NO₃)₂), or cadmium sulfate (CdSO₄) are all excellent choices as they readily dissolve in water to provide free Cd²⁺ ions.\n- **Sulfur Precursor:** A water-soluble sulfide source is required. Sodium sulfide (Na₂S) is a common choice as it is highly soluble and provides S²⁻ ions in solution. Bubbling hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) gas through the solution is another possibility, as is using thiourea which hydrolyzes to release sulfide.\n- **Conclusion for Method 2:** A suitable precursor set is a water-soluble salt like Cadmium chloride (CdCl₂) and a water-soluble sulfide source like Sodium sulfide (Na₂S).\n\n**Evaluation of the Options:**\n\n- **A. Method 1:** CdCl₂ and Na₂S. These are ionic salts, insoluble in nonpolar organic solvents. **Method 2:** CdO/oleic acid and elemental sulfur. These are precursors for a nonpolar system, not an aqueous one. This option incorrectly swaps the precursor types for the two methods.\n- **B. Method 1:** Cd(s) and Na₂S₂O₃. Cadmium metal is not a typical molecular precursor for this type of synthesis, and sodium thiosulfate is a water-soluble salt, inappropriate for a nonpolar solvent. **Method 2:** CdCO₃ and H₂S. Cadmium carbonate is largely insoluble in water, making it a poor choice for a homogeneous aqueous precursor solution.\n- **C. Method 1:** CdO with oleic acid and elemental sulfur. This correctly identifies a standard set of precursors for a high-temperature, nonpolar synthesis. **Method 2:** CdCl₂ and Na₂S. This correctly identifies a standard set of precursors for a low-temperature, aqueous synthesis. This option is fully consistent with our analysis.\n- **D. Method 1:** CdO/oleic acid and Na₂S. This pairs an organo-soluble cadmium precursor with a water-soluble (and organo-insoluble) sulfur precursor. They are incompatible in the same solvent. **Method 2:** CdCl₂ and elemental sulfur. Elemental sulfur is not soluble in water. This option incorrectly mixes precursors.\n- **E. Method 1:** CdSO₄ and H₂S. Cadmium sulfate is an ionic salt, insoluble in nonpolar solvents. **Method 2:** CdO and Na₂S₂O₃. Cadmium oxide is insoluble in water at room temperature. This option uses inappropriate precursors for both methods.\n\nTherefore, option C is the only one that correctly assigns appropriate precursors to both synthetic routes based on their chemical properties and the reaction conditions.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2292611"}, {"introduction": "Once a synthesis is complete, the crucial next step is to characterize the product to confirm its identity and key properties.

To confirm a crystal structure from a powder, we need an instrument that provides diffraction from many randomly oriented crystallites so that interplanar spacings can be extracted and indexed. The fundamental relation used is Bragg’s law,\n$$\nn \\lambda = 2 d \\sin \\theta,\n$$\nwhich links the X-ray wavelength $\\lambda$, the interplanar spacing $d$, and the diffraction angle $\\theta$.

By manipulating the energy of the X-ray source, one can effectively tune the technique's sensitivity to the surface versus the core, providing a powerful method for structural elucidation.", "problem": "A materials chemist is investigating a batch of bimetallic nanoparticles with an overall atomic composition of 1:1 gold (Au) to platinum (Pt). The synthesis was designed to produce core-shell nanoparticles with a gold core and a platinum shell (Au@Pt). To verify the internal structure and rule out the formation of a homogeneous Au-Pt alloy, the chemist uses X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS). XPS works by irradiating a material with X-rays of a known energy ($h\\nu$) and measuring the kinetic energy (KE) of the emitted photoelectrons. The binding energy (BE) of a core-level electron is then found using the relation $\\text{KE} = h\\nu - \\text{BE}$. The signal intensity from a given element is dependent on its concentration within the probing depth, which is related to the Inelastic Mean Free Path (IMFP) of the photoelectrons. A larger IMFP corresponds to a deeper probing depth.\n\nThe experiment is performed using two different X-ray sources:\n1.

The inelastic mean free path $\\lambda$ of photoelectrons increases with kinetic energy in this regime, so the Cr source provides a larger probing depth than the Al source.\n\nThe detected intensity from a given element is depth-weighted approximately by an exponential attenuation, so that the contribution from depth $z$ is weighted by $\\exp(-z/\\lambda)$; thus a smaller $\\lambda$ (lower kinetic energy) emphasizes the near-surface region, while a larger $\\lambda$ (higher kinetic energy) samples deeper into the particle.\n\nThe reported atomic ratios have already been obtained by data analysis of the spectra, which accounts for element-specific sensitivity factors. Therefore, differences in the corrected Au/Pt ratio with photon energy reflect changes in depth sensitivity rather than raw cross-section effects.\n\nExperimentally, using the more surface-sensitive Al source, the Au/Pt ratio is $0.31$, which indicates a Pt-rich surface. Using the more bulk-sensitive Cr source, the Au/Pt ratio is $1.62$, which indicates an Au-rich interior. This depth-dependent inversion (surface Pt-rich, bulk Au-rich) is exactly the trend expected for nanoparticles with a gold core and a platinum shell (Au@Pt).\n\nA homogeneous alloy would yield the same corrected Au/Pt ratio at both photon energies, close to the overall 1:1 composition. A platinum core with a gold shell would show the opposite trend: an Au-rich ratio with the surface-sensitive Al source and a lower Au/Pt ratio with the bulk-sensitive Cr source. Different binding energies do not make the experiment inconclusive; they enable element-specific detection. A physical mixture of separate Au and Pt nanoparticles with overall 1:1 composition would not show a systematic reversal of the ratio with probing depth.\n\nTherefore, the most consistent structure is a gold core with a platinum shell.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2292613"}]}
