This exercise challenges you to apply the rules to understand why a compound like ZnS exhibits polymorphism—existing in multiple crystal forms—while NaCl is remarkably stable in a single structure. This practice highlights the importance of not just which range a ratio falls into, but how close it is to a stability boundary between different coordination environments [@problem_id:2285991].", "problem": "A materials scientist is studying the structural chemistry of binary ionic compounds. It is empirically known that Zinc Sulfide ($\\text{ZnS}$) commonly crystallizes in two distinct polymorphs, zincblende and wurtzite, both of which feature a 4:4 coordination environment where each ion is surrounded by four ions of the opposite charge. In contrast, Sodium Chloride ($\\text{NaCl}$) is exceptionally stable in a single structure, the rock salt form, which exhibits a 6:6 coordination environment.\n\nTo investigate this difference, the scientist decides to apply the radius ratio rules, which predict the most stable coordination number (CN) for an ionic compound based on the ratio of the cation radius ($r_+$) to the anion radius ($r_-$).\n\nUsing the data provided below, determine which of the following statements provides the most accurate explanation for the observed structural behavior of $\\text{ZnS}$ and $\\text{NaCl}$.\n\n**Provided Data:**\nIonic Radii:\n- $r(\\text{Na}^+) = 102 \\text{ pm}$\n- $r(\\text{Cl}^-) = 181 \\text{ pm}$\n- $r(\\text{Zn}^{2+}) = 74 \\text{ pm}$\n- $r(\\text{S}^{2-}) = 184 \\text{ pm}$\n\nRadius Ratio ($r_+/r_-$) Ranges for Idealized Ionic Packing:\n- $0.225 \\le r_+/r_-  0.414$: Predicted CN = 4 (Tetrahedral geometry)\n- $0.414 \\le r_+/r_-  0.732$: Predicted CN = 6 (Octahedral geometry)\n- $0.732 \\le r_+/r_-  1.000$: Predicted CN = 8 (Cubic geometry)\n\n**Choices:**\nA.
