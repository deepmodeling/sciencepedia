The geometry of organic linkers dictates how they connect metal nodes, and classifying them by 'topicity'—the number of connection points—is the first step in predicting the final structure. This exercise [@problem_id:2270762] provides practice in applying this key concept to 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate (BTC), a classic linker in MOF chemistry.", "problem": "Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are a class of crystalline, porous materials constructed from two primary components: metal ions or clusters, which act as nodes, and organic molecules, known as linkers or struts, that connect these nodes. The dimensionality and topology of the resulting framework are heavily influenced by the geometry of both the metal nodes and the organic linkers.\n\nThe functionality of an organic linker is often described by its \"topicity,\" which refers to the number of points on the molecule that can bind or coordinate to the metal centers to extend the framework. For example, a linker that can connect to two different metal centers is called \"ditopic,\" one that can connect to three is \"tritopic,\" and one that can connect to four is \"tetratopic.\"\n\nConsider the organic molecule 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate, often abbreviated as BTC. This molecule is derived from 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid by the removal of protons from its three carboxylic acid groups ($-\\text{COOH}$) to form three carboxylate groups ($-\\text{COO}^-$). In the context of MOF synthesis, each of these carboxylate groups is capable of coordinating to a metal center.\n\nBased on its chemical structure and the typical coordination behavior of its functional groups, how would you classify the 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate (BTC) linker?\n\nA. Monotopic\n\nB. Ditopic\n\nC. Tritopic\n\nD. Tetratopic\n\nE. Pentatopic", "solution": "The problem asks for the classification of the 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate (BTC) linker based on its topicity. The topicity of a linker is defined as the number of points on the molecule that can connect to metal centers in the formation of a Metal-Organic Framework (MOF).\n\nFirst, we must analyze the structure of the 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate molecule. The name itself provides all the necessary information. The base of the molecule is a benzene ring, which is a six-membered aromatic carbon ring. The prefixes \"1,3,5-tri-\" indicate that there are three identical functional groups attached to the benzene ring at positions 1, 3, and 5.\n\nThe functional group is specified as \"carboxylate\" ($-\\text{COO}^-$). The problem statement confirms that this molecule is derived from 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylic acid, meaning it has three carboxylate groups.\n\nThe problem states that each carboxylate group is capable of coordinating to a metal center. This means that each of the three carboxylate groups on the BTC molecule serves as a potential connection point for building the MOF structure.\n\nTo determine the topicity, we simply count the number of these connection points on a single linker molecule. Since the 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate molecule has three carboxylate groups, and each acts as a connection point, there are a total of three connection points.\n\nFollowing the definitions provided:\n- A monotopic linker has one connection point.\n- A ditopic linker has two connection points.\n- A tritopic linker has three connection points.\n- A tetratopic linker has four connection points.\n\nSince the BTC linker has three connection points, it is classified as a tritopic linker.
