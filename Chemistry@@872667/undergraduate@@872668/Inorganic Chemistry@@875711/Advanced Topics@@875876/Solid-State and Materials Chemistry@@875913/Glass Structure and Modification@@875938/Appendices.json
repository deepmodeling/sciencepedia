This first exercise provides a foundational skill: calculating the degree of network disruption caused by the addition of a network modifier. By determining the fraction of non-bridging oxygens (NBOs) from the glass composition [@problem_id:2255234], you will build a direct link between chemical formula and the fundamental connectivity of the glass network.", "problem": "In the formation of silicate glasses, pure silica ($SiO_2$) consists of a three-dimensional network where silicon atoms are tetrahedrally coordinated to four oxygen atoms. In this ideal network, every oxygen atom acts as a link between two silicon atoms, and is thus called a Bridging Oxygen (BO). When a metal oxide, termed a network modifier, is introduced into the silica melt, it disrupts the network by breaking some of these Si-O-Si linkages. This process creates oxygen atoms that are bonded to only one silicon atom; these are referred to as Non-Bridging Oxygens (NBO). The charge imbalance created by an NBO is compensated by a nearby metal cation.\n\nConsider a specific alkali-silicate glass, lithium disilicate, which has an exact molar composition corresponding to the formula $Li_2O \\cdot 2SiO_2$. Within this glass structure, each formula unit of the network modifier, $Li_2O$, is responsible for breaking one Si-O-Si bridge, thereby creating two Non-Bridging Oxygens. Based on this model, determine the fraction of all oxygen atoms in the lithium disilicate glass that are non-bridging. Express your answer as a decimal.", "solution": "The composition $Li_{2}O \\cdot 2SiO_{2}$ corresponds to the stoichiometric formula $Li_{2}Si_{2}O_{5}$ for one combined formula unit. The total number of oxygen atoms per such unit is\n$$\nn_{O} = 1 \\text{ (from } Li_{2}O) + 2 \\times 2 \\text{ (from } 2SiO_{2}) = 5.\n$$\nBy the stated model, each $Li_{2}O$ creates two Non-Bridging Oxygens (NBO), so for this composition\n$$\nn_{\\text{NBO}} = 2.\n$$\nTherefore, the fraction of oxygen atoms that are non-bridging is\n$$\n\\frac{n_{\\text{NBO}}}{n_{O}} = \\frac{2}{5} = 0.4.\n$$\nAs a consistency check using bond counting, let $n_{\\text{BO}}$ and $n_{\\text{NBO}}$ be the numbers of bridging and non-bridging oxygens, respectively.

Hence the fraction of NBOs is $0.4$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0.4}$$", "id": "2255234"}, {"introduction": "Once we can quantify structural changes, we can begin to predict their impact on macroscopic properties. This practice builds upon the concept of network disruption to explore its effect on the glass transition temperature, $T_g$ [@problem_id:2255237]. You will apply your understanding of how network modifiers alter the glass framework to reason about the material's thermal behavior, a critical aspect of glass processing and application.", "problem": "In the field of materials chemistry, glasses are amorphous solids typically formed by rapidly cooling a molten liquid. Their structure is characterized by a long-range disordered network. This network is primarily built from **network formers**, which are oxides like silicon dioxide ($SiO_2$) or boron trioxide ($B_2O_3$) that form a continuous framework of strong covalent bonds. The properties of this network can be tailored by introducing **network modifiers**, which are typically alkali or alkaline earth metal oxides like lithium oxide ($Li_2O$) or calcium oxide ($CaO$).\n\nThe **glass transition temperature ($T_g$)** is a critical property of a glass, representing the temperature at which it transitions from a hard, rigid state to a more pliable, viscous state upon heating. A higher $T_g$ generally corresponds to a more rigid and strongly interconnected atomic network.\n\nConsider a simple borate glass composed entirely of the network former $B_2O_3$. A small molar percentage of the $B_2O_3$ in this glass is replaced with the compound $Li_2O$. Based on the established roles of glass formers and modifiers, predict the effect of this substitution on the glass transition temperature ($T_g$) and the underlying structural reason for this change.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the outcome?\n\nA. $T_g$ will increase because $Li_2O$ integrates into the network as a secondary network former, increasing the overall bond density.\n\nB. $T_g$ will decrease because $Li_2O$ acts as a network modifier, disrupting the continuous B-O-B network and creating non-bridging oxygens.\n\nC. $T_g$ will remain essentially unchanged because the small size of the $Li^+$ ions allows them to occupy interstitial sites without breaking network bonds.\n\nD. $T_g$ will decrease because the Li-O bonds formed are inherently weaker than the B-O bonds, lowering the overall stability of the network.\n\nE. $T_g$ will increase because the $Li^+$ ions form strong ionic cross-links between different parts of the borate network, increasing its rigidity.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine how substituting some boron trioxide ($B_2O_3$) with lithium oxide ($Li_2O$) in a borate glass affects its glass transition temperature ($T_g$).\n\nStep 1: Identify the roles of the components.\nIn the context of oxide glasses, chemical compounds are classified based on their role in the glass structure.\n- **Boron trioxide ($B_2O_3$)** is a canonical **network former**. It forms a continuous, three-dimensional random network of covalently bonded atoms. In pure $B_2O_3$ glass, the structure is primarily composed of corner-sharing $[BO_3]$ triangular units. Each oxygen atom acts as a **bridging oxygen (BO)**, linking two boron atoms in a B-O-B bond.\n- **Lithium oxide ($Li_2O$)** is a classic **network modifier**. Oxides of alkali metals (like $Li_2O$, $Na_2O$) and alkaline earth metals (like $CaO$, $MgO$) do not form networks on their own. Instead, they disrupt the network established by the former.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the effect of the network modifier on the glass structure.\nWhen a network modifier like $Li_2O$ is introduced into the molten borate glass, it dissociates into its constituent ions: $Li_2O \\rightarrow 2Li^+ + O^{2-}$. The oxide ion ($O^{2-}$) from the modifier is highly reactive and attacks the covalent bonds of the network. Specifically, it breaks a bridging oxygen bond (B-O-B). This process can be visualized as:\n\n$$\n\\text{B-O-B (bridging)} + O^{2-} \\rightarrow 2(\\text{B-O}^-)\n$$\n\nThe result of this reaction is the conversion of one bridging oxygen into two **non-bridging oxygens (NBOs)**. A non-bridging oxygen is an oxygen atom bonded to only one network-forming cation (in this case, boron) and carries a formal negative charge. This negative charge is locally compensated by the proximity of the positively charged modifier cations ($Li^+$).\n\nStep 3: Relate the structural change to the glass transition temperature ($T_g$).\nThe glass transition temperature, $T_g$, is a measure of the network's rigidity. It corresponds to the thermal energy required to activate large-scale segmental motion of the polymer-like glass network.\n\n- **Initial State (Pure $B_2O_3$):** The network is highly interconnected and continuous, held together by strong B-O-B covalent linkages. This high degree of connectivity results in a relatively high $T_g$.\n- **Final State (With $Li_2O$):** The creation of non-bridging oxygens breaks the continuity of the network. It's akin to cutting links in a chain-link fence. The network becomes less connected, more fragmented, and has a lower average degree of polymerization. This reduced connectivity means that the network segments can move more easily relative to each other. Less thermal energy is required to induce the viscous flow characteristic of the state above $T_g$.\n\nTherefore, the introduction of the network modifier $Li_2O$ leads to a **decrease** in the glass transition temperature, $T_g$.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the given options.\n- A. $T_g$ will increase because $Li_2O$ integrates into the network as a secondary network former... This is incorrect. $Li_2O$ is a network modifier, not a former.\n- B. $T_g$ will decrease because $Li_2O$ acts as a network modifier, disrupting the continuous B-O-B network and creating non-bridging oxygens. This statement correctly identifies $Li_2O$ as a modifier and accurately describes the mechanism (disruption via NBO creation) and the consequence (decrease in $T_g$). This is the correct answer.\n- C. $T_g$ will remain essentially unchanged... This is incorrect. The chemical interaction is significant and leads to bond-breaking, which is a primary effect, not a secondary interstitial one.\n- D. $T_g$ will decrease because the Li-O bonds formed are inherently weaker... While the effect on $T_g$ is correct, the reasoning is incomplete and potentially misleading. The primary reason for the decrease in $T_g$ is not the strength of individual bonds, but the reduction in the overall connectivity and dimensionality of the network. The breaking of the continuous covalent network is the key factor.\n- E. $T_g$ will increase because the $Li^+$ ions form strong ionic cross-links... This is incorrect. The cations ($Li^+$) act as charge compensators for the NBOs. They do not form rigid cross-links that would increase rigidity; rather, their presence is a consequence of the network being broken, which decreases rigidity. Therefore, $T_g$ decreases, not increases.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2255237"}, {"introduction": "The structural changes induced by network modifiers affect more than just thermal properties; they also profoundly influence a glass's chemical resilience. This problem extends our structure-property investigation into the realm of chemical durability [@problem_id:2255258]. You will analyze how the presence of non-bridging oxygens and their associated modifier cations creates vulnerabilities in the network, providing a framework for understanding and predicting how a glass will interact with a corrosive environment.", "problem": "In the manufacturing of commercial glass, silicon dioxide ($SiO_2$), a network former, is often mixed with metal oxides like sodium oxide ($Na_2O$), which act as network modifiers to lower the melting temperature and viscosity. A materials scientist is studying a series of simple binary sodium silicate glasses. The glasses are prepared with varying compositions, characterized by the molar ratio of the network modifier to the network former, $R = \\frac{n_{Na_2O}}{n_{SiO_2}}$, where $n$ represents the number of moles. The scientist wants to understand how this compositional change affects the material's resistance to chemical attack.\n\nConsider a set of these sodium silicate glass samples where the ratio $R$ is systematically increased. Each sample is then submerged in a dilute aqueous acidic solution at a constant temperature. Based on the fundamental principles of glass structure, how is the chemical durability of the glass expected to change as the ratio $R$ increases, and why?\n\nA. The chemical durability will increase, because the sodium ions fill interstitial voids in the silica network, making it denser and less permeable to the acidic solution.\n\nB. The chemical durability will decrease, because the addition of sodium oxide breaks covalent bonds in the silica network, creating sites for ion-exchange with protons from the acid.\n\nC. The chemical durability will remain essentially constant, as the fundamental $Si-O$ covalent network remains the dominant structural feature and is inherently resistant to acid.\n\nD. The chemical durability will first increase and then decrease, because an initial small addition of sodium oxide relieves ring strain in the silica network, but larger amounts cause significant degradation.\n\nE. The chemical durability will decrease, because the sodium oxide acts as a catalyst, directly accelerating the hydrolysis of $Si-O-Si$ bonds by the acid.", "solution": "We consider sodium silicate glasses composed of a network former, $SiO_{2}$, and a network modifier, $Na_{2}O$. The composition is parameterized by $R = \\frac{n_{Na_{2}O}}{n_{SiO_{2}}}$. The structural role of $Na_{2}O$ is to depolymerize the $Si-O-Si$ network by creating non-bridging oxygens (NBOs) that are charge-balanced by $Na^{+}$.\n\nPrinciple 1: Charge balance and NBO stoichiometry. Each $Na_{2}O$ contributes two $Na^{+}$ ions to charge-balance two non-bridging oxygens, so the number of NBOs equals the number of $Na^{+}$, which is $2 n_{Na_{2}O}$. The number of tetrahedrally coordinated silicon atoms equals $n_{SiO_{2}}$. Therefore, the number of non-bridging oxygens per tetrahedron (NBO/T) is\n$$\n\\text{NBO/T} = \\frac{2 n_{Na_{2}O}}{n_{SiO_{2}}} = 2R.\n$$\nAs $R$ increases, $\\text{NBO/T}$ increases linearly, indicating progressive depolymerization of the network.\n\nPrinciple 2: Network connectivity. A fully polymerized silica network has $4$ bridging oxygens per tetrahedron. Introducing NBOs reduces the average number of bridging oxygens per tetrahedron to $4 - \\text{NBO/T} = 4 - 2R,$ which decreases with increasing $R$. Lower connectivity weakens the network and increases free volume and pathways for transport.\n\nPrinciple 3: Acidic corrosion mechanism. In dilute acidic solutions, the initial and often dominant step is ion-exchange between mobile alkali cations and protons from solution at sites associated with NBOs:\n$$\n\\equiv Si-O^{-} Na^{+} + H^{+}_{(aq)} \\to \\equiv Si-OH + Na^{+}_{(aq)}.\n$$\nAs $\\text{NBO/T}$ increases with $R$, the density of exchangeable sites increases, enhancing the rate of alkali leaching. This exchange also protonates the network, which facilitates subsequent hydrolysis of $Si-O-Si$ linkages:\n$$\n\\equiv Si-O-Si \\equiv + H_{2}O \\to \\equiv Si-OH + HO-Si \\equiv,\n$$\na process made more favorable in the vicinity of NBOs due to reduced bond strength and increased local basicity prior to protonation. Thus, higher $R$ leads to faster ion-exchange and hydrolysis, i.e., lower chemical durability.\n\nAssessment of options based on these principles:\n- A is incorrect because $Na_{2}O$ does not fill interstitial voids to densify; it breaks $Si-O-Si$ bonds and creates NBOs, opening the network.\n- B is correct: adding $Na_{2}O$ breaks covalent $Si-O-Si$ bonds, increases NBO density, and creates sites for $H^{+}/Na^{+}$ exchange, decreasing durability.\n- C is incorrect because the modifier content strongly affects durability via NBO formation and ion-exchange pathways.\n- D is not supported in this simple binary system under dilute acid; the typical trend is a monotonic decrease in durability with increasing modifier content.\n- E is incorrect in mechanism: $Na_{2}O$ is not acting as a catalyst; it alters structure rather than providing a catalytic cycle.\n\nTherefore, as $R$ increases, chemical durability decreases due to increased depolymerization and enhanced ion-exchange and hydrolysis, corresponding to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2255258"}]}
