When a lattice is constructed, atoms at different positions within a unit cell are shared with adjacent unit cells. For any cubic crystal system, the following sharing rules apply:\n- A lattice point at a corner is shared equally among 8 adjacent unit cells.\n- A lattice point on an edge is shared equally among 4 adjacent unit cells.\n- A lattice point on a face is shared equally among 2 adjacent unit cells.\n- A lattice point located entirely within the body of the cell belongs exclusively to that cell.\n\nBased on this information, calculate the total effective number of lattice points that belong to a single conventional FCC unit cell.", "solution": "In a face-centered cubic conventional unit cell, lattice points occur at the eight corners and at the centers of the six faces.
