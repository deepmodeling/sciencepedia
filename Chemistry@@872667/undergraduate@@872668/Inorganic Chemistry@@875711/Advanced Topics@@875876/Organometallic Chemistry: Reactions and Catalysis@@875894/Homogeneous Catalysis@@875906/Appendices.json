The complex is neutral overall. We need to assign charges to the ligands to find the metal's oxidation state.\n\n-   **Cl (chloro ligand):** This is an anionic ligand, $Cl^-$. Its charge is -1.\n-   **CO (carbonyl ligand):** This is a neutral ligand. Its charge is 0.\n-   **PPh$_3$ (triphenylphosphine ligand):** This is a neutral ligand. Its charge is 0.\n\nLet the oxidation state of iridium be $x$. The sum of the oxidation state of the metal and the charges of the ligands must equal the overall charge of the complex, which is 0.\n\n$$x + (\\text{charge of Cl}) + (\\text{charge of CO}) + 2 \\times (\\text{charge of PPh}_3) = 0$$\n$$x + (-1) + (0) + 2 \\times (0) = 0$$\n$$x - 1 = 0 \\implies x = +1$$\n\nSo, the formal oxidation state of iridium in Vaska's complex is +1, denoted as Ir(I).\n\nNext, we calculate the d-electron count. Iridium (Ir) is in Group 9 of the periodic table, so a neutral Ir atom has 9 valence electrons. The d-electron count for an ion is the number of valence electrons of the neutral atom minus its oxidation state.\n\n$$\\text{d-electron count} = (\\text{valence electrons of neutral Ir}) - (\\text{oxidation state})$$\n$$\\text{d-electron count} = 9 - 1 = 8$$\n\nThus, the initial state of the iridium center is **Ir(I), $d^8$**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the final state (After oxidative addition of H₂)**\n\nVaska's complex reacts with $H_2$ in an oxidative addition reaction. In this process, the $H-H$ bond is broken, and two new bonds are formed between the iridium center and each hydrogen atom. The two hydrogen atoms add as two separate hydride ligands ($H^−$).\n\nThe reaction is:\n$trans\\text{-}[IrCl(CO)(PPh_3)_2] + H_2 \\rightarrow [Ir(H)_2(Cl)(CO)(PPh_3)_2]$\n\nThe resulting complex is $[Ir(H)_2(Cl)(CO)(PPh_3)_2]$, which is also neutral overall. Now we determine the new oxidation state of iridium.\n\n-   **Cl (chloro ligand):** Charge is -1.\n-   **CO (carbonyl ligand):** Charge is 0.\n-   **PPh$_3$ (triphenylphosphine ligand):** Charge is 0.\n-   **H (hydrido ligand):** This is an anionic ligand, $H^-$. Its charge is -1. There are two such ligands.\n\nLet the new oxidation state of iridium be $y$.\n\n$$y + 2 \\times (\\text{charge of H}) + (\\text{charge of Cl}) + (\\text{charge of CO}) + 2 \\times (\\text{charge of PPh}_3) = 0$$\n$$y + 2 \\times (-1) + (-1) + (0) + 2 \\times (0) = 0$$\n$$y - 2 - 1 = 0 \\implies y = +3$$\n\nThe new formal oxidation state is +3, or Ir(III). The oxidation state of the metal has increased by 2, which is characteristic of oxidative addition.\n\nNow, we calculate the new d-electron count for Ir(III).\n\n$$\\text{d-electron count} = (\\text{valence electrons of neutral Ir}) - (\\text{oxidation state})$$\n$$\\text{d-electron count} = 9 - 3 = 6$$\n\nThus, the final state of the iridium center is **Ir(III), $d^6$**.\n\n**Step 3: Combine results and select the correct option**\n\nThe transition is from an initial state of Ir(I), $d^8$ to a final state of Ir(III), $d^6$.\n\nComparing this with the given options:\nA. Ir(I), $d^8$ $\\rightarrow$ Ir(I), $d^8$ (Incorrect final state)\nB. Ir(I), $d^8$ $\\rightarrow$ Ir(II), $d^7$ (Incorrect final state)\nC.

Consider the hydrolysis of methyl benzoate ($C_6H_5COOCH_3$) in an acidic aqueous solution. The overall reaction is:\n$C_6H_5COOCH_3 + H_2O \\xrightarrow{H^+} C_6H_5COOH + CH_3OH$\n\nTo determine the operative mechanism, an experiment is conducted using water enriched with a heavy oxygen isotope, $H_2^{18}O$.

This is followed by a bimolecular nucleophilic attack of a water molecule on the carbonyl carbon.

Equally distributed between the benzoic acid and methanol products.\n\nD. Only in the unreacted water, with no incorporation into either organic product.\n\nE. In both products, but with a significantly higher concentration in the methanol.", "solution": "The problem asks to predict the location of an $^{18}O$ isotopic label in the products of the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of methyl benzoate, given that the reaction follows the Acyl-Oxygen Cleavage pathway (Pathway A). Let's trace the path of the heavy oxygen atom from the labeled water molecule, $H_2^{18}O$, through this specific mechanism.\n\nThe overall reaction is:\n$C_6H_5COOCH_3 + H_2^{18}O \\xrightarrow{H^+} \\text{Products}$\n\n**Pathway A: Acyl-Oxygen Cleavage**\n\nThis mechanism is analogous to the standard bimolecular acyl substitution mechanism, often denoted $A_{Ac}2$.\n\n**Step 1: Protonation of the Carbonyl Oxygen**\nThe acid catalyst ($H^+$) protonates the most basic site on the ester, which is the carbonyl oxygen. This enhances the electrophilicity of the carbonyl carbon.\n$C_6H_5C(=O)OCH_3 + H^+ \\rightleftharpoons C_6H_5C(=OH^+)OCH_3$\n\n**Step 2: Nucleophilic Attack by Labeled Water**\nThe isotopically labeled water molecule, $H_2^{18}O$, acts as a nucleophile and attacks the now highly electrophilic carbonyl carbon. This is the bimolecular step specified in the problem description.\n$C_6H_5C(=OH^+)OCH_3 + H_2^{18}O \\rightarrow C_6H_5C(OH)(OCH_3)(^{18}OH_2^+)$\nThis step forms a tetrahedral intermediate. Crucially, the $^{18}O$ atom is now bonded to the former carbonyl carbon.\n\n**Step 3: Proton Transfer**\nA proton is transferred from the newly added, positively charged labeled oxygen atom to the methoxy oxygen. This makes the methoxy group a better leaving group (methanol, $CH_3OH$). This can occur in one or more steps, potentially mediated by solvent molecules.\n$C_6H_5C(OH)(OCH_3)(^{18}OH_2^+) \\rightleftharpoons C_6H_5C(OH)(OCH_3H^+)(^{18}OH)$\n\n**Step 4: Elimination of Methanol**\nThe tetrahedral intermediate collapses. The lone pair on the original carbonyl oxygen (now a hydroxyl group) pushes down to reform a double bond, and the protonated methoxy group leaves as a neutral methanol molecule.\n$C_6H_5C(OH)(OCH_3H^+)(^{18}OH) \\rightarrow C_6H_5C(=^{18}OH^+)OH + CH_3OH$\nThe leaving group, methanol ($CH_3OH$), contains the original ester oxygen, not the heavy isotope from the solvent. The product is a protonated form of benzoic acid, with the $^{18}O$ atom incorporated into its carbonyl group.\n\n**Step 5: Deprotonation**\nThe protonated benzoic acid loses a proton to a base (e.g., a water molecule) to yield the final, neutral benzoic acid product and regenerate the acid catalyst.\n$C_6H_5C(=^{18}OH^+)OH + H_2O \\rightleftharpoons C_6H_5C(=^{18}O)OH + H_3O^+$\nNote that due to rapid proton exchange with the solvent, the label will be distributed between the carbonyl and hydroxyl oxygens of the final benzoic acid product: $C_6H_5CO^{18}OH \\rightleftharpoons C_6H_5C(=O)^{18}OH$. However, the key point is that the $^{18}O$ atom is incorporated exclusively into the benzoic acid molecule and not into the methanol molecule.\n\n**Conclusion**\nBy following the Acyl-Oxygen Cleavage pathway (Pathway A), the nucleophilic attack of $H_2^{18}O$ occurs at the carbonyl carbon. The original $C_{acyl}-OCH_3$ bond is broken, and the $OCH_3$ group leaves as methanol, carrying its original, unlabeled oxygen atom. The $^{18}O$ from the water is incorporated into the new carboxylic acid. Therefore, the isotopic label will be found exclusively in the benzoic acid product. This corresponds to option A.\n\nFor completeness, if the reaction had followed Pathway B (Alkyl-Oxygen Cleavage, or $A_{Al}1$), the protonated ester would have dissociated to form $C_6H_5COOH$ and a methyl carbocation, $\\text{CH}_3^+$. The labeled water, $H_2^{18}O$, would then attack the $\\text{CH}_3^+$ carbocation, leading to the formation of labeled methanol, $\\text{CH}_3^{18}\\text{OH}$. In that case, the label would have been found exclusively in the methanol product (Option B).
