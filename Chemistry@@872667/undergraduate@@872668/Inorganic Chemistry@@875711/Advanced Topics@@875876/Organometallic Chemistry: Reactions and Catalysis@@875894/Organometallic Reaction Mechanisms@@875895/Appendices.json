When one equivalent of $CH_3Li$ is added to one equivalent of $W(CO)_6$ at low temperature, a stable anionic intermediate is formed. This intermediate is the kinetic product of the initial nucleophilic addition. Which of the following chemical formulas most accurately represents this initial anionic product, shown with its counter-ion?\n\nA. $Li^+[W(CO)_5(CH_3)]^-$\n\nB. $Li^+[(CO)_5W-C(O)CH_3]^-$\n\nC. $Li^+[(CO)_5W-C(OCH_3)]^-$\n\nD. No reaction occurs due to the extreme stability of the 18-electron $W(CO)_6$ complex.", "solution": "We identify the relevant reactivity principles for metal carbonyls under nucleophilic conditions. The complex $W(CO)_6$ is an 18-electron, $d^6$, formally $W(0)$ complex. Although 18-electron complexes are often thermodynamically stable, this does not preclude nucleophilic attack at a coordinated $CO$ ligand. Coordinated carbonyl ligands possess low-lying $\\pi^*$ orbitals and exhibit enhanced electrophilicity at the carbon atom due to metal-to-ligand backbonding, making them susceptible to nucleophilic attack by strong nucleophiles such as $CH_3^-$ from $CH_3Li$ in ethereal solvents.\n\nAt low temperature with one equivalent of $CH_3Li$, the kinetic product is formed by nucleophilic addition of $CH_3^-$ to the carbon atom of a coordinated $CO$, converting that $CO$ into an acyl ligand. The reaction is:\n$$\nW(CO)_6 + CH_3Li \\longrightarrow Li^+\\big[(CO)_5W-C(O)CH_3\\big]^-\n$$\nThis anionic acyl complex is stabilized at low temperature and is the well-established initial product of nucleophilic attack on metal carbonyls.\n\nElectron counting confirms its plausibility as a kinetic product. In $Li^+\\big[(CO)_5W-C(O)CH_3\\big]^-$, the anion has one $X$-type acyl ligand and five $L$-type $CO$ ligands. The net charge of the anion is $-1$. Assigning ligand charges (acyl $-1$, $CO$ neutral), the tungsten oxidation state remains $0$ to satisfy overall charge balance, consistent with known chemistry of such anionic acylates. The valence electron count is $6$ (from $W(0)$) $+ 10$ (from $5 \\times CO$ as $2$-electron donors) $+ 2$ (from the acyl as a two-electron $X$-type donor) $= 18$ electrons, which explains the observed stability of the intermediate.\n\nEvaluation of options:\n- Option A, $Li^+[W(CO)_5(CH_3)]^-$, would correspond to a methyl ligand bound directly to tungsten, implying substitution of a $CO$ by $CH_3^-$. The initial, kinetically favored pathway for strong nucleophiles is attack at a coordinated $CO$ to form an acyl, not direct $CO$ displacement to form a metal–alkyl at low temperature. Thus A does not describe the initial kinetic product.\n- Option B, $Li^+[(CO)_5W-C(O)CH_3]^-$, exactly represents the anionic acyl complex formed by nucleophilic attack of $CH_3^-$ on a coordinated $CO$ ligand, the known kinetic product.\n- Option C, $Li^+[(CO)_5W-C(OCH_3)]^-$, implies incorporation of an $OCH_3$ substituent on the carbenoid carbon, which would arise from methoxide ($CH_3O^-$), not from $CH_3^-$. It is not the product of the initial $CH_3^-$ attack.\n- Option D is incorrect because 18-electron stability does not prevent nucleophilic addition to coordinated $CO$; this reaction is well documented.\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is the anionic acyl complex shown in option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2275922"}, {"introduction": "Reductive elimination is a pivotal elementary step in which the metal center's oxidation state decreases as two ligands are coupled and eliminated as a new molecule.

Here, coupling of two methyl ligands would produce ethane. In a square planar complex bearing three methyl ligands and one phosphine, at least two methyl ligands must be cis, allowing this pathway.\n- $\\beta$-Hydride elimination is not possible from a methyl ligand because methyl has no $\\beta$-hydrogen.\n- Reductive elimination of $R-H$ (to form methane) requires either a hydride ligand or an external proton source; neither is present in an inert solvent.\n- Formation of ethene would typically proceed via $\\beta$-hydride elimination from an ethyl ligand followed by reductive elimination, but no ethyl ligand is present and methyl lacks a $\\beta$-hydrogen.\n- Formation of propane would require coupling of methyl with an ethyl fragment, which is not available.\n\nTherefore, the dominant thermally allowed pathway is C–C reductive elimination of two methyl ligands to give ethane, reducing $Au(III)$ to $Au(I)$ and yielding the linear, two-coordinate $d^{10}$ complex $(PMe_3)Au(CH_3)$:\n$$[(PMe_3)Au(CH_3)_3] \\longrightarrow (PMe_3)Au(CH_3) + C_2H_6$$\n\nThus, the most probable major organic product is ethane.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2286396"}, {"introduction": "Determining the precise sequence of events in a reaction—the mechanism—is a central goal of chemistry, and oxidative addition is no exception.

An inverse $\\alpha$-secondary KIE, $k_H/k_D  1$, is characteristic of concerted $S_N2$-type attack at carbon: in the transition state the C–H bending modes are stiffer, lowering the zero-point energy more for H than D and leading to $k_H  k_D$. By contrast, a radical pathway involving formation of a methyl radical ($sp^2$-like) from $sp^3$ $CH_3I$ typically gives a normal $\\alpha$-secondary KIE, $k_H/k_D > 1$ (often around $1.1$), owing to the change in hybridization and hyperconjugation effects.\n\nThe observed inverse KIE of $0.88$ is therefore consistent with the concerted $S_N2$-like oxidative addition at carbon (Mechanism A) and inconsistent with a radical pathway (Mechanism B).
