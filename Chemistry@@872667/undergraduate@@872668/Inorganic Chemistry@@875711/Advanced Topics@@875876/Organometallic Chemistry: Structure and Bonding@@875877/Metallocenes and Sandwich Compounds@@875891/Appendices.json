The rule states that thermodynamically stable transition metal complexes tend to have a total of 18 valence electrons in the shell of the central metal atom, which is a combination of the metal's d-electrons and the electrons supplied by its surrounding ligands.\n\nConsider a neutral half-sandwich chromium complex with the general formula $(\\eta^6-\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_6)\\text{Cr}(\\text{CO})_x$.

The electron contribution from the central metal atom is its number of valence electrons, which corresponds to its group number in the periodic table. Chromium (Cr) is in Group 6.\n2.

The electronic structure and, consequently, the physical properties of these compounds are highly dependent on the identity of the central metal atom. Consider two such compounds: ferrocene, with the formula Fe(Cp)₂, and vanadocene, with the formula V(Cp)₂. Based on the principles of electron counting and molecular orbital theory for organometallic complexes, determine the expected magnetic behavior (paramagnetic or diamagnetic) for each of these compounds at room temperature.\n\nFor the purpose of electron counting, treat the cyclopentadienyl ligand (Cp) as the cyclopentadienyl anion (Cp⁻).

Ferrocene is diamagnetic, and vanadocene is diamagnetic.", "solution": "The magnetic property of a compound is determined by the presence of unpaired electrons. A compound with one or more unpaired electrons is paramagnetic, while a compound with all electrons paired is diamagnetic. For organometallic complexes like metallocenes, we can predict the number of unpaired electrons by determining the total valence electron count and considering how these electrons fill the molecular orbitals (MOs) of the complex.\n\n**Step 1: Analyze Ferrocene, Fe(Cp)₂**\n\nFirst, we determine the oxidation state of the iron (Fe) center. The cyclopentadienyl ligand is treated as the anion, Cp⁻, which has a charge of -1. Since the overall complex Fe(Cp)₂ is neutral, the iron atom must have an oxidation state of +2 to balance the charge of the two Cp⁻ ligands. So, we have Fe(II) or Fe²⁺.\n\nNext, we find the d-electron count of the Fe²⁺ ion. A neutral iron atom (Group 8) has the electron configuration [Ar] 3d⁶4s². To form the Fe²⁺ ion, it loses the two 4s electrons, leaving an electron configuration of [Ar] 3d⁶. Thus, Fe²⁺ is a d⁶ metal center.\n\nNow, we calculate the total valence electron count for the ferrocene complex. The Fe²⁺ ion contributes 6 valence electrons. Each Cp⁻ ligand is a 6-electron donor.\nTotal valence electrons = (electrons from Fe²⁺) + 2 × (electrons from Cp⁻)\nTotal valence electrons = 6 + 2 × 6 = 18 electrons.\n\nA total count of 18 valence electrons corresponds to a filled valence shell for an organometallic complex, analogous to the octet rule for main group elements. In the molecular orbital diagram for ferrocene, the 18 electrons completely fill the bonding and non-bonding orbitals. The highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMO) are a degenerate pair ($e_{2g}$) which are fully occupied. There are no unpaired electrons in the ground state. Therefore, ferrocene is diamagnetic.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze Vanadocene, V(Cp)₂**\n\nFollowing the same procedure, we determine the oxidation state of the vanadium (V) center. With two Cp⁻ ligands, the vanadium atom must have an oxidation state of +2 to ensure the complex is neutral. So, we have V(II) or V²⁺.\n\nNext, we find the d-electron count of the V²⁺ ion. A neutral vanadium atom (Group 5) has the electron configuration [Ar] 3d³4s². To form the V²⁺ ion, it loses the two 4s electrons, leaving an electron configuration of [Ar] 3d³. Thus, V²⁺ is a d³ metal center.\n\nNow, we calculate the total valence electron count for the vanadocene complex. The V²⁺ ion contributes 3 valence electrons. Each Cp⁻ ligand is a 6-electron donor.\nTotal valence electrons = (electrons from V²⁺) + 2 × (electrons from Cp⁻)\nTotal valence electrons = 3 + 2 × 6 = 15 electrons.\n\nA total of 15 electrons means the complex has an open-shell configuration. These 15 electrons will fill the molecular orbitals. The three valence d-electrons from the metal occupy the frontier molecular orbitals, which for a standard metallocene are the $a'_{1g}$ and the degenerate $e_{2g}$ orbitals. According to Hund's rule, electrons will singly occupy degenerate orbitals before pairing up. The three electrons will therefore occupy these orbitals, resulting in an electronic configuration of $(a'_{1g})^1(e_{2g})^2$. This leaves three unpaired electrons. The presence of unpaired electrons makes the compound paramagnetic. Therefore, vanadocene is paramagnetic.\n\n**Step 3: Conclusion**\n\nBased on our analysis:\n- Ferrocene has 18 valence electrons, all of which are paired. It is diamagnetic.\n- Vanadocene has 15 valence electrons, resulting in 3 unpaired electrons. It is paramagnetic.\n\nThis corresponds to the statement: \"Ferrocene is diamagnetic, and vanadocene is paramagnetic.\"\n\nComparing this with the given options, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2271085"}, {"introduction": "Metallocenes are not static objects; their constituent parts are often in motion. This phenomenon, known as fluxionality, can lead to different experimental observations depending on the timescale of the measurement technique. This thought-provoking exercise [@problem_id:2271061] explores the classic case of ferrocene, guiding you to reconcile seemingly contradictory data from X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy to reveal the dynamic nature of its 'sandwich' structure.", "problem": "Ferrocene, with the chemical formula Fe($\\eta^5$-C$_5$H$_5$)$_2$, is a classic example of a metallocene or \"sandwich\" compound, where an iron atom is situated between two parallel cyclopentadienyl (Cp) rings. Experimental studies of ferrocene have revealed seemingly contradictory structural information depending on the technique and temperature.\n\nAt low temperatures (below 164 K), X-ray crystallography of solid ferrocene shows that the two Cp rings are in a staggered conformation, corresponding to a molecule with $D_{5d}$ point group symmetry. However, a room-temperature $^1$H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrum of ferrocene dissolved in a suitable solvent exhibits only a single, sharp resonance for all ten protons on the two Cp rings.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and complete explanation for these two experimental observations?\n\nA. The eclipsed conformation of ferrocene is significantly more stable than the staggered one. The single NMR peak arises because the molecule is rigidly locked in this high-symmetry eclipsed conformation at room temperature.\n\nB. The staggered and eclipsed conformations are energetically degenerate. The single NMR peak is an artifact caused by the accidental magnetic equivalence of all ten protons in the static staggered structure.\n\nC. The staggered conformation is the thermodynamically favored ground state, but the energy barrier to ring rotation is very small. At room temperature, the rings undergo rapid rotation relative to each other, a process that is much faster than the NMR measurement timescale, resulting in a time-averaged signal where all protons appear equivalent.\n\nD. The staggered conformation is the ground state, but ring rotation is a very slow process, even at room temperature. The NMR spectrometer is too fast to resolve the individual proton environments of a static structure and therefore records a simplified, single average peak.\n\nE. At room temperature in solution, ferrocene completely dissociates into a free Fe$^{2+}$ cation and two separate cyclopentadienyl anions (Cp$^−$). These free anions tumble rapidly and independently, causing all of their protons to become equivalent and giving rise to a single NMR signal.", "solution": "We first restate the two experimental observations to be reconciled:\n(1) Low-temperature X-ray crystallography of solid ferrocene reveals a staggered conformation with $D_{5d}$ symmetry.\n(2) A room-temperature $^{1}$H NMR spectrum in solution shows a single sharp resonance for all ten Cp protons.\n\nThe key physical principle from NMR spectroscopy is the dynamic exchange timescale criterion: if distinct nuclear environments interconvert with an exchange rate $k_{\\text{ex}}$ that is fast relative to the NMR frequency separation between those environments, i.e., $k_{\\text{ex}} \\gg \\Delta\\omega$ (with $\\Delta\\omega$ in angular frequency units), then the observed resonance collapses to a single, time-averaged line. Conversely, if $k_{\\text{ex}} \\ll \\Delta\\omega$, separate resonances are observed.\n\nIn ferrocene, the two Cp rings can rotate about the Fe–Cp axes, interconverting staggered and eclipsed relative orientations. The energy barrier to this rotation is small, so at room temperature in solution the exchange rate satisfies $k_{\\text{ex}} \\gg \\Delta\\omega$, placing the system in the fast-exchange regime. Therefore, NMR detects a single, averaged resonance for the Cp protons. This dynamic process is a standard example of fluxional behavior in organometallic compounds.\n\nThe low-temperature X-ray result is fully compatible with this picture: in the crystalline solid at low temperature, rotational motion is hindered by the lattice and reduced thermal energy, allowing the structure to be captured in its thermodynamically favored staggered conformation with $D_{5d}$ symmetry.\n\nA subtle but important note is that both idealized $D_{5d}$ (staggered) and $D_{5h}$ (eclipsed) ferrocene possess high symmetry that renders all ten Cp protons chemically equivalent in a static, perfectly symmetric molecule. However, the experimentally observed combination—staggered in the low-temperature crystal and a single-peak NMR at room temperature in solution—is most accurately and completely explained by recognizing that the rings undergo rapid rotation in solution on the NMR timescale, averaging any potential distinctions and ensuring a single resonance. This fluxionality also accounts for the general behavior observed across temperatures and phases, and is the accepted rationale for ferrocene’s spectroscopic features.\n\nWe now evaluate the options:\n- A is incorrect because the eclipsed form is not significantly more stable; moreover, ferrocene is not rigidly locked in the eclipsed conformation at room temperature.\n- B is incorrect because calling the single peak an “artifact” of accidental magnetic equivalence is misleading; the equivalence is symmetry-dictated, and the option’s claim of energetic degeneracy is not required to explain the data.\n- C correctly states that the staggered conformation is the ground state and that the barrier to ring rotation is small, leading to rapid rotation at room temperature and a single, time-averaged NMR signal.\n- D incorrectly inverts the NMR timescale logic; slow exchange would yield multiple resonances, not a single averaged one.\n- E is chemically untenable; ferrocene does not dissociate into Fe$^{2+}$ and two Cp$^{-}$ anions in solution under the described conditions.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and complete explanation is given by option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2271061"}]}
