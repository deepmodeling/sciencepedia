This first practice applies this fundamental concept to a binuclear complex, a scenario that requires you to account for electrons from ligands as well as from a metal-metal bond. Mastering this type of problem [@problem_id:2239829] is crucial for understanding the structures of metal carbonyl clusters.", "problem": "In transition metal chemistry, a common heuristic for predicting the stability of organometallic compounds is the 18-electron rule, which states that stable complexes often have a total of 18 valence electrons associated with the metal center. Consider a binuclear metal carbonyl complex with the chemical formula $Mn_2(CO)_n$. The structure of this complex is known to be symmetric, featuring a single covalent bond between the two manganese (Mn) atoms. All carbonyl (CO) ligands are terminal, meaning each CO is bonded to only one Mn atom, and they are distributed equally between the two metal centers.\n\nTo apply the 18-electron rule to this dimeric complex, we consider each metal center individually. Determine the integer value of $n$, the total number of carbonyl ligands in the entire complex, that allows each manganese center to satisfy the 18-electron rule.", "solution": "We apply the neutral ligand electron-counting method to one of the two identical Mn centers. The problem asks for the total number of CO ligands, $n$. Given the symmetry, each Mn atom is bonded to $n/2$ CO ligands.\n\n1.  **Manganese (Mn)** is in Group 7 and contributes $7$ valence electrons.\n2.  The single **Mn–Mn bond** contributes $1$ electron to the count at each Mn center.\n3.  Each **carbonyl (CO) ligand** is a 2-electron donor. The total contribution from the $n/2$ ligands on one Mn center is therefore $2 \\times (n/2) = n$ electrons.\n\nTo satisfy the 18-electron rule, the sum of these contributions must be 18:\n$$ (\\text{e}^- \\text{ from Mn}) + (\\text{e}^- \\text{ from Mn–Mn}) + (\\text{e}^- \\text{ from COs}) = 18 $$\n$$ 7 + 1 + n = 18 $$\n$$ 8 + n = 18 $$\nSolving for $n$:\n$$ n = 10 $$\nTherefore, the total number of carbonyl ligands in the entire complex is 10.

This final practice delves into the subtle but critical differences between phosphine ligands, focusing on their $\\pi$-acceptor capabilities.

A key electronic characteristic is their ability to act as a $\\pi$-acceptor, which involves accepting electron density from filled metal d-orbitals into empty orbitals on the ligand. This property is crucial for stabilizing metal complexes, particularly those with electron-rich, low-valent metal centers. The strength of this $\\pi$-acceptor interaction depends significantly on the nature of the substituents (R) attached to the phosphorus atom.\n\nConsider the following three phosphine ligands:\n1.

Electron-withdrawing substituents on phosphorus (e.g., $F$ in $PF_{3}$) stabilize and lower the energy of ligand acceptor orbitals (typically $\\sigma^{\\ast}(P\\text{-}R)$ orbitals that can accept metal $d$-electron density with appropriate symmetry). This increases $\\pi$-acceptor character.\n2.
