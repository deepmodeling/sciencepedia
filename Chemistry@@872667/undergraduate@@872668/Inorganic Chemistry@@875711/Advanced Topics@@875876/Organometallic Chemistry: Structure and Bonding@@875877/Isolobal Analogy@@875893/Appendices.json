Two fragments are considered isolobal if their frontier molecular orbitals—the highest occupied and lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals—are similar in symmetry, approximate energy, and electron occupation.

Let $x$ be the oxidation state of Mn in $H\\text{Mn(CO)}_5$. Using that CO is an $L$-type neutral donor with charge $0$ and $H$ is $H^{-}$ with charge $-1$, and the overall complex is neutral,\n$$x + (5 \\times 0) + (-1) = 0 \\implies x = +1.$$\nThus Mn is in the $+1$ oxidation state, so it is a $d^6$ center because Mn is in group $7$, and $d = 7 - 1 = 6$.\n\nNext, compute the valence electron count using the ionic method. Each CO donates $2$ electrons as an $L$-type ligand, and $H^-$ donates $2$ electrons as an $X$-type ligand.

Alternative six-coordinate geometries such as trigonal prismatic are rare for such ligands and electronic configurations. By contrast, the other listed geometries correspond to different coordination numbers or electronic preferences: tetrahedral is typically four-coordinate, square planar is characteristic of $d^8$, and trigonal bipyramidal is five-coordinate.\n\nTherefore, the coordination geometry around Mn in $H\\text{Mn(CO)}_5$ is octahedral.
