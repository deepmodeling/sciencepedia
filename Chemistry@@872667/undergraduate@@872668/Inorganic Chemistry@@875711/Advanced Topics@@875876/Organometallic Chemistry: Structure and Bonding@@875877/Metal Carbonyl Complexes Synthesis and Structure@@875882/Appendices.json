A particularly stable configuration is achieved when this count totals 18 electrons. Consider the formation of a stable, neutral, mononuclear complex containing a central manganese (Mn) atom bonded to one hydride (H) ligand and an unknown number, `n`, of carbonyl (CO) ligands. The chemical formula for this complex is $HMn(CO)_n$.\n\nTo determine the value of `n`, use the neutral ligand model for electron counting with the following information:\n- The manganese atom is in Group 7 of the periodic table and contributes its group number of valence electrons.\n- The neutral hydride ligand is a one-electron donor.\n- Each neutral carbonyl ligand is a two-electron donor.\n\nDetermine the integer value of `n` required for the complex $HMn(CO)_n$ to achieve the stable 18-electron configuration.", "solution": "Apply the 18-electron rule using the neutral (covalent) electron counting model.

The starting material is hexacarbonylmolybdenum(0), $Mo(CO)_6$. The chemist plans to synthesize two new complexes by substituting one carbonyl ligand (CO) with either trimethylamine ($N(CH_3)_3$) or triphenylphosphine ($P(C_6H_5)_3$). The change in electronic structure is monitored by observing the shift in the stretching frequencies of the remaining CO ligands using Infrared (IR) spectroscopy. A lower C-O stretching frequency ($\\nu_{CO}$) indicates a weaker C-O bond, which corresponds to greater electron donation from the metal center into the CO antibonding orbitals (a phenomenon known as $\\pi$-back-donation).\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly predicts which ligand will cause a greater decrease in the $\\nu_{CO}$ frequencies and provides the correct electronic justification?\n\nA. Trimethylamine, because it is a strong $\\sigma$-donor and lacks $\\pi$-acceptor capabilities, leading to a maximal increase in electron density on the metal that is available for back-donation to the carbonyls.\n\nB. Triphenylphosphine, because phosphorus is less electronegative than nitrogen, making it a fundamentally stronger electron donor ligand, thus increasing back-donation more significantly.\n\nC. Triphenylphosphine, because its ability to act as a $\\pi$-acceptor ligand withdraws electron density from the C-O antibonding orbitals, causing their frequencies to decrease.\n\nD. Trimethylamine, because the small methyl groups result in less steric hindrance compared to the bulky phenyl groups, allowing for a stronger metal-ligand bond and more effective electronic communication.\n\nE. Both ligands will cause a nearly identical decrease in the stretching frequencies because their overall basicities are comparable.", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine which ligand, trimethylamine ($N(CH_3)_3$) or triphenylphosphine ($P(C_6H_5)_3$), will cause a larger decrease in the C-O stretching frequency ($\\nu_{CO}$) when substituted into $Mo(CO)_6$. The magnitude of the $\\nu_{CO}$ frequency is an inverse measure of the strength of the C-O bond. The key to solving this problem lies in understanding how the electronic properties of the substituting ligand affect the electron density on the molybdenum metal center, which in turn dictates the extent of $\\pi$-back-donation to the remaining CO ligands.\n\nFirst, let's establish the mechanism of $\\pi$-back-donation in the parent complex, $Mo(CO)_6$. The molybdenum atom in its zero oxidation state has a $d^6$ electron configuration. It forms a $\\sigma$-bond with each CO ligand by accepting a lone pair of electrons from the carbon atom. Simultaneously, the filled d-orbitals on the molybdenum atom (of $t_{2g}$ symmetry in an octahedral field) have the correct orientation to overlap with the empty $\\pi^*$ antibonding orbitals of the CO ligands. This donation of electron density from the metal d-orbitals to the CO $\\pi^*$ orbitals is called $\\pi$-back-donation. Populating the antibonding orbitals of CO weakens the carbon-oxygen triple bond, causing its vibrational stretching frequency, $\\nu_{CO}$, to decrease relative to that of free CO (which is $2143 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$).\n\nNow, let's consider the substitution of one CO ligand with a new ligand, L, to form $Mo(CO)_5L$. The electronic properties of L will modify the electron density on the Mo center.\n\n1.  **Analysis of Trimethylamine ($N(CH_3)_3$):** Nitrogen is a period 2 element. It has a lone pair of electrons residing in an $sp^3$ hybrid orbital, which it can donate to the metal to form a $\\sigma$-bond. Due to its high electronegativity and the lack of accessible, low-energy empty orbitals of the correct symmetry, nitrogen in an amine ligand is considered a pure $\\sigma$-donor. It cannot act as a $\\pi$-acceptor. As a strong $\\sigma$-donor, $N(CH_3)_3$ increases the electron density on the molybdenum atom significantly. This surplus electron density on the metal must be delocalized. It is effectively passed on to the remaining five CO ligands via increased $\\pi$-back-donation. This enhanced back-donation populates the CO $\\pi^*$ orbitals to a greater extent, further weakening the C-O bonds and causing a substantial decrease in their $\\nu_{CO}$ frequencies.\n\n2.  **Analysis of Triphenylphosphine ($P(C_6H_5)_3$):** Phosphorus is a period 3 element. Like nitrogen, it has a lone pair of electrons that it can donate to form a $\\sigma$-bond with the metal. However, its electronic character is more complex. Firstly, phosphorus is less electronegative than nitrogen, which would suggest it might be a better $\\sigma$-donor. However, the lone pair on phosphorus has more s-character than in amine, making it less basic and a weaker $\\sigma$-donor than trimethylamine. Secondly, and more importantly, phosphorus has accessible empty orbitals that can participate in $\\pi$-bonding. These are conventionally described as empty 3d-orbitals, but a more modern and accurate description involves the low-lying antibonding $\\sigma^*$ orbitals of the P-C bonds. Regardless of the exact description, these orbitals have the correct symmetry to overlap with the metal's filled d-orbitals and accept electron density. Thus, triphenylphosphine acts as both a $\\sigma$-donor and a $\\pi$-acceptor.\n\n3.  **Comparison:** When $P(C_6H_5)_3$ replaces a CO ligand, it donates electron density to the metal via its $\\sigma$-bond but also withdraws electron density from the metal via $\\pi$-back-donation to itself. This $\\pi$-acceptance by the phosphine ligand puts it in direct competition with the remaining CO ligands for the metal's d-electron density. In contrast, $N(CH_3)_3$ only donates electron density and does not compete for back-donation. Therefore, the net increase in electron density on the molybdenum center that is available for back-donation to the CO ligands is greater when the substituent is trimethylamine.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBecause trimethylamine is a pure, strong $\\sigma$-donor with no competing $\\pi$-acceptor character, its substitution leads to a larger net increase in electron density on the molybdenum atom available for back-donation to the remaining COs. This results in a more significant weakening of the C-O bonds and, consequently, a greater decrease (larger downward shift) in the $\\nu_{CO}$ stretching frequencies compared to the substitution with triphenylphosphine.\n\nLet's evaluate the given options:\n- A: Correctly identifies trimethylamine as the ligand causing the greater effect and provides the correct reasoning: it is a pure $\\sigma$-donor without $\\pi$-acceptor ability, maximizing electron density for CO back-donation.\n- B: Incorrect. While P is less electronegative than N, this is an oversimplification. Triphenylphosphine is a weaker overall donor than trimethylamine due to its own $\\pi$-acceptance and the nature of the lone pair.\n- C: Incorrect reasoning. $\\pi$-acceptance by the phosphine ligand *increases* the C-O stretching frequency (or lessens the decrease) because it competes with the CO ligands for back-donation, it does not synergistically weaken the C-O bonds.\n- D: Incorrect. While sterics (Tolman cone angle) are a factor in ligand substitution chemistry, the primary effect on $\\nu_{CO}$ is electronic. Steric hindrance does not directly explain the change in back-donation.\n- E: Incorrect. The electronic properties of an amine and a phosphine, particularly regarding $\\pi$-bonding, are fundamentally different, leading to different effects on $\\nu_{CO}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2269203"}, {"introduction": "Metal carbonyls are not just theoretical constructs; they must be synthesized in the laboratory, often under specific conditions.
