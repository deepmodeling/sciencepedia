This reaction is known to proceed to completion, yielding a single major organometallic product. The geometry of the starting complex is square planar, with the two bulky PPh$_3$ ligands positioned *trans* to each other, and similarly, the carbonyl (CO) and chloro (Cl) ligands are *trans* to one another.\n\nAssuming the reaction results in a stable, six-coordinate octahedral iridium(III) complex, identify the correct structural description of this major product from the options provided below.\n\nA.

Using the neutral ligand method, CO and PPh$_3$ are neutral donors, while Cl is an anionic ligand with charge $-1$. The overall complex is neutral, so the metal oxidation state satisfies\n$$\\text{ox. state of Ir} + (-1) = 0 \\implies \\text{Ir is } +1.$$\nIridium in the $+1$ oxidation state is $d^8$, and with four ligands it adopts a square planar geometry, consistent with the given structure.\n\nReaction with CH$_3$I proceeds by oxidative addition of the C–I bond to the Ir center. The fundamental principle of oxidative addition is that both the metal oxidation state and coordination number increase by $2$. Thus, Ir goes from $+1$ to $+3$ and from $d^8$ to $d^6$, giving a six-coordinate octahedral $\\text{Ir}^{3+}$ product. Formally, CH$_3$I adds as CH$_3^{-}$ and I$^{-}$, so in the product the anionic ligands are Cl$^{-}$, I$^{-}$, and CH$_3^{-}$, giving a neutral complex with Ir in the $+3$ oxidation state:\n$$\\text{Ir}^{3+} \\text{ with ligation: CO, Cl}^{-}, \\text{I}^{-}, \\text{CH}_{3}^{-}, \\text{PPh}_{3}, \\text{PPh}_{3}.$$\n\nThe stereochemical outcome follows the well-established behavior of oxidative addition to square planar $d^8$ complexes (Vaska-type). The four ligands present prior to oxidative addition define a square plane. In a stereospecific oxidative addition that retains the original arrangement, the two newly added ligands occupy the two positions perpendicular to that plane in the resulting octahedral complex. These two positions are trans to each other. Consequently:\n- The original trans relationships (PPh$_3$ trans to PPh$_3$, and CO trans to Cl) are retained in the equatorial plane.\n- The newly added CH$_3$ and I necessarily occupy the remaining pair of positions, which are trans to each other.\n\nThis geometric constraint can also be seen from the octahedral geometry: if two independent trans pairs (PPh$_3$–PPh$_3$ and CO–Cl) are fixed, the remaining two coordination sites must form the third trans pair. Therefore, with the original trans pairs preserved, CH$_3$ and I must be trans to each other.\n\nWe now assess the options:\n- Option A matches exactly this outcome: PPh$_3$ ligands remain trans, CO and Cl remain trans, and CH$_3$ and I are trans. This is the expected stereospecific oxidative addition product and is also sterically favorable because the bulky PPh$_3$ ligands remain trans.\n- Option B proposes CH$_3$ and I cis while both PPh$_3$ and CO–Cl remain trans. This is geometrically impossible in an octahedron; fixing two independent trans pairs forces the last two positions to be trans, not cis.\n- Options C and D require rearrangement to make the two bulky PPh$_3$ ligands cis. This is strongly disfavored sterically and contradicts the usual stereoretentive outcome of oxidative addition to this Ir(I) square planar precursor.\n- Option E is false; oxidative addition of CH$_3$I to trans-[Ir(CO)Cl(PPh$_3$)$_2$] is a well-known, facile reaction that proceeds to completion under the stated conditions.\n\nTherefore, the correct structural description is given by option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2288165"}, {"introduction": "While understanding how reactions occur is vital, it is equally important to understand why they sometimes do not. The stability of organometallic compounds is often governed by kinetic factors, such as the electron count at the metal center. This problem [@problem_id:2300461] explores the concept of kinetic stability by asking you to identify why a specific metal-alkyl complex is resistant to β-hydride elimination, a common decomposition pathway.", "problem": "Beta-hydride elimination is a fundamental reaction pathway in organometallic chemistry, representing a common decomposition mechanism for metal-alkyl complexes. For this reaction to occur directly, several conditions must typically be met, including the presence of at least one hydrogen atom on the carbon atom beta to the metal center and an available coordination site on the metal.\n\nConsider the organometallic complex ethylpentacarbonylmanganese(I), which has the chemical formula $[Mn(CO)_5(CH_2CH_3)]$. Which of the following statements provides the most accurate and primary reason for the observed kinetic stability of this complex against direct β-hydride elimination under standard laboratory conditions?\n\nA. The ethyl group ($-\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3$) lacks β-hydrogens, which are a mechanistic prerequisite for the reaction.\n\nB. The complex is coordinatively saturated, following the 18-electron rule, and therefore has no vacant coordination site to accept the β-hydrogen.\n\nC. The manganese center is rendered too electron-poor by the five strongly π-accepting carbonyl ligands, which destabilizes the transition state for C-H bond activation.\n\nD. The five carbonyl ligands create significant steric hindrance that prevents the M-C-C-H dihedral angle from achieving the syn-coplanar geometry required for the transition state.\n\nE. The overall reaction is thermodynamically unfavorable because the formation of a manganese-hydride bond and an ethene molecule is energetically uphill from the starting manganese-ethyl complex.", "solution": "Beta-hydride elimination from a metal-alkyl complex proceeds by a concerted pathway that requires: (i) at least one hydrogen on the carbon beta to the metal, (ii) a vacant coordination site on the metal to accept an agostic interaction from the C–H bond in a syn-coplanar M–C–C–H arrangement, and (iii) a suitable electron count and geometry to access the transition state. The most immediate kinetic gate is the need for a vacant site.\n\nFor the complex $[\\text{Mn(CO)}_5(\\text{CH}_2\\text{CH}_3)]$, perform an electron count using the ionic method. The manganese oxidation state is $+1$ (neutral complex; five neutral CO ligands; one anionic ethyl). Thus the metal is $d^{6}$. The ligand electron donation is: five CO ligands as $L$-type ($2$ electrons each) and one ethyl as $X$-type ($2$ electrons). Therefore the total valence electron count is\n$$\nN_{e} \\;=\\; d^{6} \\;+\\; 5\\times 2 \\;+\\; 2 \\;=\\; 6 \\;+\\; 10 \\;+\\; 2 \\;=\\; 18.\n$$\nAn $18$-electron, octahedral $d^{6}$ complex is coordinatively saturated and lacks a vacant coordination site. Direct beta-hydride elimination requires such a site to form the necessary agostic interaction and transition state; without prior ligand dissociation (for example, CO loss to generate a $16$-electron species), the direct pathway is kinetically inaccessible under standard conditions. This coordinative saturation is the primary reason for kinetic stability against direct beta-hydride elimination.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect because an ethyl group possesses beta hydrogens on the terminal methyl carbon.\n- B is correct: the complex follows the $18$-electron rule and is coordinatively saturated, leaving no vacant site for beta-hydride elimination.\n- C may describe a secondary electronic effect, but it is not the primary kinetic reason; many electron-poor complexes still undergo beta-hydride elimination if a vacant site is available.\n- D is not compelling here; carbonyls are not so sterically demanding as to universally preclude the required geometry, and sterics are not the dominant factor in this canonical system.\n- E addresses thermodynamics, whereas the observed stability is dominantly kinetic; moreover, beta-hydride elimination in analogous systems is often reversible and not strongly uphill.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate and primary reason is coordinative saturation and the absence of a vacant site, i.e., option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2300461"}, {"introduction": "The feasibility of activating a small molecule is fundamentally rooted in thermodynamics—the energy costs of breaking old bonds versus the energy gained from forming new ones.
