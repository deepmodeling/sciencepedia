The specific bonding mode of a CO ligand significantly influences its physical properties, which can be probed using Infrared (IR) spectroscopy. Consider three distinct bonding modes for CO ligands in a hypothetical neutral metal carbonyl cluster:\n\n1.  **Terminal (T):** A CO ligand is bonded to a single metal atom (M-CO).\n2.  **$\\mu_2$-bridging (B2):** A CO ligand is bonded symmetrically to two metal atoms (M-CO-M).\n3.  **$\\mu_3$-bridging (B3):** A CO ligand is bonded symmetrically to three metal atoms, capping a triangular face of the metal cluster.\n\nWhich of the following options correctly arranges these three types of carbonyl ligands in order of increasing C-O bond stretching frequency ($\\nu_{CO}$)?\n\nA.

T  B3  B2", "solution": "The problem asks to rank the Carbon-Oxygen stretching frequency ($\\nu_{CO}$) for terminal (T), $\\mu_2$-bridging (B2), and $\\mu_3$-bridging (B3) carbonyl ligands. The value of $\\nu_{CO}$ is a direct measure of the C-O bond strength; a stronger bond vibrates at a higher frequency.\n\nThe key to understanding the trend in $\\nu_{CO}$ for metal carbonyls is the concept of metal-to-ligand $\\pi$-back-donation. The bonding between a metal (M) and a carbon monoxide (CO) ligand consists of two primary interactions:\n1.  **$\\sigma$-donation:** The lone pair of electrons on the carbon atom of CO is donated into an empty d-orbital on the metal. This forms a M-C $\\sigma$-bond.\n2.  **$\\pi$-back-donation:** Electron density from filled metal d-orbitals is donated back into the empty $\\pi^*$ antibonding orbitals of the CO ligand.\n\nThe crucial interaction that affects the C-O bond strength is the $\\pi$-back-donation. When electron density is added to the $\\pi^*$ *antibonding* orbitals of the CO molecule, the bond order of the C-O bond is reduced, thereby weakening it. A weaker C-O bond results in a lower stretching frequency ($\\nu_{CO}$) observed in the IR spectrum.\n\nNow, let's analyze the extent of $\\pi$-back-donation for each of the three bonding modes:\n\n-   **Terminal (T):** A single metal atom back-donates electron density into the CO $\\pi^*$ orbitals. This weakens the C-O bond relative to free CO (which has $\\nu_{CO} \\approx 2143 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$).\n\n-   **$\\mu_2$-bridging (B2):** The CO ligand is positioned between two metal atoms. Both metal atoms can simultaneously back-donate electron density into the same set of CO $\\pi^*$ orbitals. This results in a greater total amount of electron density being transferred into the antibonding orbitals compared to the terminal case. Consequently, the C-O bond in a $\\mu_2$-bridging ligand is weaker than that in a terminal ligand.\n\n-   **$\\mu_3$-bridging (B3):** The CO ligand interacts with three metal atoms. All three metals can contribute electron density to the CO $\\pi^*$ orbitals. This leads to the most extensive back-donation among the three modes. The C-O bond is therefore the most significantly weakened in the $\\mu_3$-bridging mode.\n\nTo summarize the effect on C-O bond strength:\nBond Strength (T)  Bond Strength (B2)  Bond Strength (B3)\n\nSince the stretching frequency ($\\nu_{CO}$) is directly proportional to the bond strength, the frequencies must follow the same order:\n$\\nu_{CO}$ (T)  $\\nu_{CO}$ (B2)  $\\nu_{CO}$ (B3)\n\nThe question asks for the arrangement in order of *increasing* C-O bond stretching frequency. Therefore, we must reverse the order:\n$\\nu_{CO}$ (B3)  $\\nu_{CO}$ (B2)  $\\nu_{CO}$ (T)\n\nThis corresponds to the ordering B3  B2  T. Comparing this with the given options, we find that option C matches our derived order.\n\nAs a reference, typical IR stretching frequency ranges for these modes in neutral metal carbonyls are:\n-   Terminal (T): 1850 – 2120 cm⁻¹\n-   $\\mu_2$-bridging (B2): 1750 – 1850 cm⁻¹\n-   $\\mu_3$-bridging (B3): 1600 – 1750 cm⁻¹", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2274091"}, {"introduction": "Building on the principles of carbonyl spectroscopy, this next practice challenges you to act as a structural chemist.

The frequency is directly related to bond strength and follows the general trend:\n$$\\nu(\\text{terminal CO}) > \\nu(\\mu_2\\text{-bridging CO}) > \\nu(\\mu_3\\text{-capping CO})$$\nThis trend arises because as a CO ligand bridges more metal centers, it receives more extensive $\\pi$-back-donation into its antibonding $\\pi^*$ orbitals, which weakens the C-O bond and lowers its stretching frequency.\n\nThe experimental spectrum shows exactly two bands: one at $1995 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$ and another at $1860 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$. The band at $1995 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$ falls squarely in the region for terminal CO ligands. The band at $1860 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$ is characteristic of $\\mu_2$-bridging CO ligands. The presence of these two bands strongly suggests a structure containing both terminal and $\\mu_2$-bridging carbonyls. The fact that there are *only* two bands implies that the molecule possesses high symmetry, causing the ligands of each type to be spectroscopically equivalent.\n\nWith these criteria, the options can be evaluated:\n- **Options B and E:** These structures contain only terminal carbonyls. They would not produce an absorption band as low as $1860 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$ and are therefore incorrect.\n- **Option D:** This $C_{3v}$ structure contains a $\\mu_3$-capping ligand, which would typically exhibit a $\\nu_{CO}$ band at a frequency lower than $1860 \\text{ cm}^{-1}$. Furthermore, the nine terminal ligands would likely give rise to multiple distinct bands, making it inconsistent with the simple two-band spectrum.\n- **Option C:** This $C_{2v}$ structure has low symmetry. The terminal CO ligands would fall into multiple symmetry-inequivalent sets, which would be expected to produce more than one terminal absorption band in the IR spectrum. This contradicts the observation of only one terminal band.\n- **Option A:** This highly symmetric $D_{3h}$ structure contains exactly two distinct sets of carbonyl ligands: a set of three equivalent terminal COs and a set of three equivalent $\\mu_2$-bridging COs. Group theory predicts that for each set of three equivalent oscillators, one IR-active mode will be generated. This leads to a total of exactly two IR bands, one for the terminal set and one for the bridging set. The predicted frequencies (one high, one low) and the number of bands perfectly match the experimental data.\n\nTherefore, the structure described in Option A is the only one consistent with all the spectroscopic evidence.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2274078"}, {"introduction": "Having mastered the common bonding modes of CO, we now venture into the realm of the hypothetical to test the robustness of our bonding models.
