This exercise provides foundational practice in qualitatively ranking some of the most common phosphines by their size (steric bulk) and electron-donating power (electronic effect). By analyzing the structure of the substituent groups on phosphorus, you can develop an intuition for the steric and electronic landscape of organometallic chemistry [@problem_id:2280761].", "problem": "In organometallic chemistry, the properties of phosphine ligands are often characterized by their steric and electronic parameters. Consider the following three phosphine ligands:\n\n*   Ligand A: Trimethylphosphine, $P(\\text{CH}_3)_3$\n*   Ligand B: Triphenylphosphine, $P(\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5)_3$\n*   Ligand C: Tricyclohexylphosphine, $P(\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_{11})_3$\n\nThe steric bulk of these ligands is quantified by the Tolman cone angle (Θ), while their electronic nature is described by their $\\sigma$-donor strength.

The order of increasing cone angle is A < B < C, and the order of increasing $\\sigma$-donor strength is A < B < C.", "solution": "We seek the relative orders of steric bulk (Tolman cone angle Θ) and electronic $\\sigma$-donor strength for the ligands $A = \\text{P(CH}_3)_3$, $B = \\text{P(C}_6\\text{H}_5)_3$, and $C = \\text{P(C}_6\\text{H}_{11})_3$ based on structure–property principles.\n\nFor sterics, the Tolman cone angle Θ increases with the size of substituents around phosphorus. The methyl group is the smallest typical alkyl substituent; the phenyl group is larger due to its six-membered ring and extended footprint; and the cyclohexyl group is a bulky saturated ring with a large three-dimensional envelope. Therefore, the steric order is\n$\\Theta(A)  \\Theta(B)  \\Theta(C)$.\n\nFor electronics, the $\\sigma$-donor strength correlates with the basicity of the phosphorus lone pair and the inductive/hyperconjugative effects of substituents. Alkyl groups are electron-releasing (positive inductive effect), increasing electron density at phosphorus, whereas aryl groups are less electron-donating and can reduce basicity relative to alkyls. Among the alkyl-substituted phosphines considered, tricyclohexylphosphine is known to be an especially strong $\\sigma$ donor (very strong +I effect with bulky saturated rings), stronger than trimethylphosphine, while triphenylphosphine is the weakest donor of the three. Equivalently, using the Tolman electronic parameter concept, stronger donors give lower $\\nu(\\text{CO})$ values, and the qualitative order is consistent with\ndonor strength: $B  A  C$.\n\nCombining both results, the single correct statement is the one with increasing cone angle $A  B  C$ and increasing $\\sigma$-donor strength $B  A  C$, which matches option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2280761"}, {"introduction": "The electronic character of a phosphine ligand is not just a qualitative concept; it can be quantified through experimental measurements. This practice demonstrates how infrared (IR) spectroscopy of a metal carbonyl complex serves as a sensitive probe for a ligand's electron-donating ability, a principle central to the Tolman electronic parameter. You will apply your understanding of substituent electronic effects to predict how subtle changes on the ligand's periphery translate into a measurable change in the complex's M-CO backbonding [@problem_id:2280757].", "problem": "The electronic properties of phosphine ligands are crucial in tuning the reactivity of organometallic catalysts. One common experimental method to quantify these properties is to measure the carbonyl stretching frequency ($\\nu(\\text{CO})$) of a related metal carbonyl complex using Infrared (IR) spectroscopy.\n\nConsider three arylphosphine ligands, designated X, Y, and Z:\n- Ligand X: Tris(4-methoxyphenyl)phosphine, $P(p\\text{-C}_6\\text{H}_4\\text{OMe})_3$\n- Ligand Y: Triphenylphosphine, $P(\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5)_3$\n- Ligand Z: Tris(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)phosphine, $P(p\\text{-C}_6\\text{H}_4\\text{CF}_3)_3$\n\nThese ligands are used to form a series of complexes with the general formula $L\\text{Ni(CO)}_3$, where $L$ is one of the phosphines X, Y, or Z. It is known that the magnitude of the $\\nu(\\text{CO})$ frequency is inversely related to the electron-donating ability of the phosphine ligand L; a more strongly electron-donating ligand results in a lower $\\nu(\\text{CO})$ value for the complex.\n\nBased on the electronic effects of the substituents on the phenyl rings, predict the correct order of the $\\nu(\\text{CO})$ stretching frequencies for the complexes formed with ligands X, Y, and Z.\n\nA. $\\nu(\\text{CO})_X > \\nu(\\text{CO})_Y > \\nu(\\text{CO})_Z$\n\nB. $\\nu(\\text{CO})_Z > \\nu(\\text{CO})_Y > \\nu(\\text{CO})_X$\n\nC. $\\nu(\\text{CO})_Y > \\nu(\\text{CO})_X > \\nu(\\text{CO})_Z$\n\nD. $\\nu(\\text{CO})_Z > \\nu(\\text{CO})_X > \\nu(\\text{CO})_Y$\n\nE. $\\nu(\\text{CO})_X = \\nu(\\text{CO})_Y = \\nu(\\text{CO})_Z$", "solution": "The problem asks us to determine the relative order of the carbonyl stretching frequencies, $\\nu(\\text{CO})$, for three complexes of the type $L\\text{Ni(CO)}_3$, where L is one of three different arylphosphine ligands (X, Y, or Z). The problem states that $\\nu(\\text{CO})$ is inversely related to the electron-donating ability of the ligand L. Therefore, to solve the problem, we must first rank the ligands according to their electron-donating strength ($\\sigma$-donor ability) and then use this ranking to determine the order of the $\\nu(\\text{CO})$ frequencies.\n\nStep 1: Analyze the electronic nature of the substituents on each phosphine ligand.\nThe three ligands are based on the triphenylphosphine, $P(\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5)_3$, framework. The electronic character of the phosphorus lone pair, which is responsible for $\\sigma$-donation to the metal, is modulated by the substituents on the para-position of the phenyl rings.\n\n- Ligand Y, triphenylphosphine ($P(\\text{C}_6\\text{H}_5)_3$), has no substituents on its phenyl rings. It serves as our reference point.\n\n- Ligand X, tris(4-methoxyphenyl)phosphine ($P(p\\text{-C}_6\\text{H}_4\\text{OMe})_3$), has a methoxy group (-OMe) at the para position. The oxygen atom in the methoxy group has lone pairs that can be donated into the aromatic ring's $\\pi$-system through resonance (a +R effect). This resonance donation increases the electron density of the ring. While oxygen is electronegative and exerts an electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I), the resonance effect from the para position is dominant. Therefore, the -OMe group is an overall electron-donating group (EDG). This increased electron density is partially relayed to the phosphorus atom, making its lone pair more available for donation. Thus, Ligand X is a stronger electron donor than Ligand Y.\n\n- Ligand Z, tris(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)phosphine ($P(p\\text{-C}_6\\text{H}_4\\text{CF}_3)_3$), has a trifluoromethyl group (-CF$_3$) at the para position. The three highly electronegative fluorine atoms strongly pull electron density away from the carbon atom. This creates a powerful electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I) that propagates through the sigma bonds of the phenyl ring. The -CF$_3$ group is a strong electron-withdrawing group (EWG). This withdrawal of electron density from the ring reduces the electron density at the phosphorus atom, making its lone pair less available for donation. Thus, Ligand Z is a weaker electron donor than Ligand Y.\n\nStep 2: Rank the ligands by their $\\sigma$-donating strength.\nBased on the analysis in Step 1, the methoxy group enhances the electron-donating ability of the phosphine, while the trifluoromethyl group diminishes it. Therefore, the order of $\\sigma$-donating strength is:\nLigand X  Ligand Y  Ligand Z\n\nStep 3: Relate ligand donor strength to the $\\nu(\\text{CO})$ frequency.\nThe interaction between the ligand, metal, and CO groups is described by the Dewar-Chatt-Duncanson model. The phosphine ligand (L) donates its lone pair electrons into an empty d-orbital on the nickel atom (the $\\sigma$-donation). In turn, the electron-rich nickel atom donates electron density from its filled d-orbitals into the empty antibonding $\\pi^*$ orbitals of the CO ligands. This process is called $\\pi$-backbonding.\n\n- A stronger $\\sigma$-donating ligand (like Ligand X) increases the electron density on the nickel center.\n- This increased electron density on the metal leads to greater $\\pi$-backbonding to the CO ligands.\n- Populating the antibonding $\\pi^*$ orbitals of CO weakens the C-O bond.\n- A weaker chemical bond vibrates at a lower frequency.\n\nTherefore, a stronger electron-donating ligand leads to a lower $\\nu(\\text{CO})$ stretching frequency.\n\nStep 4: Determine the order of the $\\nu(\\text{CO})$ frequencies.\nUsing the inverse relationship established in Step 3 and the ligand donor strength order from Step 2 (X  Y  Z):\n\n- Ligand X is the strongest donor, so its complex, $X\\text{Ni(CO)}_3$, will have the most $\\pi$-backbonding and thus the lowest $\\nu(\\text{CO})$.\n- Ligand Z is the weakest donor, so its complex, $Z\\text{Ni(CO)}_3$, will have the least $\\pi$-backbonding and thus the highest $\\nu(\\text{CO})$.\n- Ligand Y is intermediate.\n\nThe resulting order of the carbonyl stretching frequencies is:\n$\\nu(\\text{CO})_Z > \\nu(\\text{CO})_Y > \\nu(\\text{CO})_X$\n\nThis corresponds to option B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2280757"}, {"introduction": "Understanding ligand properties is essential for the practical design of catalysts with specific functions.
