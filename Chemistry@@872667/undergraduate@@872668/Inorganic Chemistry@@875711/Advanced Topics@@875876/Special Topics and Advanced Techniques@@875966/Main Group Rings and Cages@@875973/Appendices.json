See-saw", "solution": "To determine the molecular geometry around the sulfur atoms in the cyclic trimer $(\\text{SO}_3)_3$, we must first establish the Lewis structure and then apply the Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) model.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the number of valence electrons.**\nSulfur (S) is in Group 16, so it has 6 valence electrons.\nOxygen (O) is also in Group 16, so it has 6 valence electrons.\nThe molecule has 3 sulfur atoms and 9 oxygen atoms.\nTotal valence electrons = $(3 \\times 6) + (9 \\times 6) = 18 + 54 = 72$ valence electrons.\n\n**Step 2: Draw the skeletal structure and determine the Lewis structure.**\nThe problem states that the structure is a six-membered ring of alternating sulfur and oxygen atoms. This gives the ring backbone: -S-O-S-O-S-O-.\nAdditionally, each sulfur atom is bonded to two terminal oxygen atoms.\n\nLet's focus on one of the sulfur atoms. It is bonded to two oxygen atoms within the ring and two terminal oxygen atoms. This means each sulfur atom forms a total of four single bonds in the initial skeletal structure.\n\nTo create a plausible Lewis structure, we distribute the remaining electrons and aim to minimize formal charges. Let's analyze one sulfur atom and its surrounding atoms. A structure that minimizes formal charge greatly involves sulfur expanding its octet. Sulfur is in the third period, so it is capable of having an expanded octet.\n\nConsider a sulfur atom forming two double bonds with its two terminal oxygen atoms and two single bonds with the two oxygen atoms in the ring.\n- The two terminal oxygen atoms would each have a double bond and 2 lone pairs.\n- The two ring oxygen atoms would each have two single bonds and 2 lone pairs.\n- The sulfur atom would have no lone pairs and form a total of 6 bonds (two single, two double).\n\nLet's calculate the formal charges for this arrangement:\n- Formal Charge (FC) = (Valence Electrons) - (Non-bonding Electrons) - (1/2 * Bonding Electrons)\n- FC for a terminal oxygen ($\\text{O}_\\text{t}$): $6 - 4 - \\frac{1}{2}(4) = 0$\n- FC for a ring oxygen ($\\text{O}_\\text{r}$): $6 - 4 - \\frac{1}{2}(4) = 0$\n- FC for a sulfur atom (S): $6 - 0 - \\frac{1}{2}(12) = 0$\n\nThis structure results in a formal charge of zero for all atoms, making it the most stable and preferred Lewis structure.\n\n**Step 3: Apply VSEPR theory to a sulfur atom.**\nAccording to VSEPR theory, the geometry around a central atom is determined by the number of electron domains (lone pairs and bonding regions). For VSEPR purposes, single, double, and triple bonds all count as a single bonding region.\n\nLet's analyze a central sulfur atom from our derived Lewis structure:\n- It is bonded to four other atoms (two ring oxygens and two terminal oxygens). This accounts for 4 bonding regions.\n- It has no lone pairs of electrons.\n- The total number of electron domains around the sulfur atom is $4 + 0 = 4$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the electron and molecular geometries.**\n- The arrangement of 4 electron domains that minimizes repulsion is a tetrahedral geometry. This is the **electron geometry**.\n- The **molecular geometry** describes the arrangement of only the atoms. When there are no lone pairs on the central atom, the molecular geometry is the same as the electron geometry.\n- Since the sulfur atom has 4 bonding domains and 0 lone pairs, the molecular geometry around each sulfur atom is **tetrahedral**.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct answer.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2267264"}, {"introduction": "While VSEPR is powerful for many molecules, electron-deficient clusters like boranes require a more sophisticated model. The Wade-Mingos rules provide a robust framework for predicting the three-dimensional shapes of these fascinating cages based on their skeletal electron count. This practice problem [@problem_id:2267313] challenges you to apply these rules to a chemical transformation, linking a change in electron count to a predictable change in the cluster's overall structure from *nido* to *closo*.", "problem": "Boron hydrides, or boranes, form a vast array of polyhedral cluster compounds with structures that can be rationalized using the Polyhedral Skeletal Electron Pair Theory (PSEPT), often referred to as Wade-Mingos rules.

This compound undergoes a reaction involving a two-electron oxidation. Experimental analysis of the reaction mixture reveals that for every mole of $B_5H_9$ consumed, two moles of protons ($H^+$) are liberated into the solution, yielding a single, neutral boron-containing product.\n\nBased on this information, determine the structural classification of the final neutral borane product according to Wade-Mingos rules.\n\nA.

The process involves three components: the starting material, the species that are removed, and the final product.\nThe overall reaction can be written as:\n$$B_5H_9 \\rightarrow \\text{Product} + 2e^{-} + 2H^{+}$$\n\nTo find the formula of the product, which we can denote as $B_xH_y^z$, we must apply the principles of conservation of mass (for atoms) and conservation of charge.\n\n*   **Conservation of Boron Atoms:** The only source of boron is the starting material, $B_5H_9$. Since no boron atoms are lost, the number of boron atoms in the product must be the same as in the reactant.\n    $x = 5$\n\n*   **Conservation of Hydrogen Atoms:** The starting material has 9 hydrogen atoms. The reaction explicitly states that two protons ($H^+$), which are hydrogen nuclei, are liberated.\n    $y = 9 - 2 = 7$\n\n*   **Conservation of Charge:** The starting material, $B_5H_9$, is a neutral molecule, so its charge is 0. The species lost are two electrons ($2e^-$), with a total charge of $-2$, and two protons ($2H^+$), with a total charge of $+2$. The net charge of the species removed is $(-2) + (+2) = 0$.\n    Since the starting material is neutral and the net charge of the lost species is zero, the final product must also be neutral.\n    $z = 0$\n\nCombining these results, the chemical formula of the final product is $B_5H_7$.\n\n**Step 2: Classify the structure of the product using Wade-Mingos rules.**\n\nNow we apply the Polyhedral Skeletal Electron Pair Theory (PSEPT) to classify the structure of the product, $B_5H_7$. PSEPT relies on counting the number of skeletal electron pairs (SEPs) available for bonding within the cluster's framework.\n\nThe number of skeletal electrons can be calculated by summing the contributions from each atom or fragment and accounting for the overall charge. The rules for contribution are:\n*   Each B-H unit contributes $3 (\\text{from B}) - 1 (\\text{for the B-H bond}) = 2$ skeletal electrons.\n*   Each bridging H atom contributes $1$ skeletal electron.\n*   The charge $q$ on the cluster adds $-q$ electrons to the skeletal count (e.g., a 2- charge adds 2 electrons).\n\nA more direct method is to first calculate the total number of valence electrons (TVE) and then determine the skeletal electrons.\nFor the product $B_5H_7$:\n*   Number of boron atoms (vertices), $n = 5$.\n*   Total valence electrons (TVE) = (5 B atoms $\\times$ 3 valence $e^-$ each) + (7 H atoms $\\times$ 1 valence $e^-$ each)\n    $$TVE = (5 \\times 3) + (7 \\times 1) = 15 + 7 = 22$$\n\nFrom the TVE, we can calculate the number of skeletal electron pairs (SEPs). In a borane cluster with $n$ boron atoms, we can represent the molecule as $[B_n H_n]^{c-} H_p$, where $H_p$ represents bridging hydrogens. The total number of skeletal electrons is $2n+2+c+p$.\nFor $B_5H_7$, we can write it as $[B_5H_5]H_2$. This implies 5 terminal hydrogens and 2 bridging hydrogens.\n*   Skeletal electrons from the $[B_5H_5]$ core: Each B-H unit contributes 2 SEs. Total = $5 \\times 2 = 10$ SEs.\n*   Skeletal electrons from the 2 bridging hydrogens: Each bridging H contributes 1 SE. Total = $2 \\times 1 = 2$ SEs.\n*   Total Skeletal Electrons (SE) = $10 + 2 = 12$ SEs.\n\nThe number of skeletal electron pairs (SEPs) is half the number of skeletal electrons.\n$$SEPs = \\frac{12}{2} = 6$$\n\n**Step 3: Correlate SEPs with the structural type.**\n\nAccording to Wade-Mingos rules, the structure of a cluster with $n$ vertices is determined by its number of SEPs:\n*   $n+1$ SEPs $\\rightarrow$ *closo* structure (a complete, closed deltahedron)\n*   $n+2$ SEPs $\\rightarrow$ *nido* structure (a deltahedron with one vertex missing)\n*   $n+3$ SEPs $\\rightarrow$ *arachno* structure (a deltahedron with two vertices missing)\n*   $n+4$ SEPs $\\rightarrow$ *hypho* structure (a deltahedron with three vertices missing)\n\nFor our product, we have:\n*   Number of vertices, $n = 5$.\n*   Number of SEPs = 6.\n\nComparing our result to the rules, we find that the number of SEPs is equal to $n+1$ (since $5+1=6$). This corresponds to a *closo* structure. The parent polyhedron for $n=5$ is a trigonal bipyramid. The oxidation of the *nido* cluster has resulted in a more compact *closo* framework.\n\nTherefore, the final product, $B_5H_7$, has a *closo* structure.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2267313"}, {"introduction": "Modern chemistry thrives on the interplay between theoretical prediction and experimental verification.

The molecular structure of this compound is a derivative of the well-characterized adamantane-like cage of phosphorus(V) oxide, $P_4O_{10}$. The parent $P_4O_{10}$ structure consists of a tetrahedron of four phosphorus atoms, where each of the six edges of the tetrahedron is bridged by an oxygen atom, and each phosphorus atom is also bonded to one additional terminal oxygen atom. In the synthesized molecule, $P_4O_9S$, one sulfur atom has replaced one of the ten oxygen atoms.

The molecule exists as a dynamic equilibrium between terminal and bridging sulfur isomers.\n\nE. The sample is a static mixture containing three parts of the bridging isomer and one part of the terminal isomer.", "solution": "The solution involves analyzing the effect of sulfur substitution on the symmetry of the $P_4O_{10}$ cage and predicting the resulting $^{31}$P NMR spectrum for each possible isomer.\n\n**Step 1: Understand the Parent Structure and NMR Principles**\nThe parent molecule, $P_4O_{10}$, has a highly symmetric adamantane-like structure. The four phosphorus atoms are at the vertices of a tetrahedron. There are two types of oxygen atoms: six bridging oxygens ($\\text{O}_\\text{bridge}$) that link pairs of phosphorus atoms along the tetrahedron edges, and four terminal oxygens ($\\text{O}_\\text{term}$) each double-bonded to one phosphorus atom. Due to the high tetrahedral ($T_d$) symmetry of the cage, all four phosphorus atoms are chemically and magnetically equivalent. Therefore, the $^{31}$P NMR spectrum of pure $P_4O_{10}$ shows a single sharp resonance. The integrated intensity of an NMR signal is proportional to the number of nuclei that generate it.\n\n**Step 2: Identify Possible Isomers of $P_4O_9S$**\nThe formula $P_4O_9S$ indicates that one oxygen atom in the parent cage has been replaced by a sulfur atom. This substitution can occur at two distinct positions:\n1.  **Terminal Isomer:** A sulfur atom replaces one of the four terminal oxygen atoms, creating a P=S double bond.\n2.  **Bridging Isomer:** A sulfur atom replaces one of the six bridging oxygen atoms, creating a P-S-P linkage.\nOption C is incorrect because the problem states an oxygen atom is replaced, not a phosphorus atom. Options D and E relate to mixtures or dynamic processes, which we will evaluate after analyzing the static isomers.\n\n**Step 3: Predict the $^{31}$P NMR Spectrum for the Terminal Isomer**\nIf a sulfur atom replaces a terminal oxygen, it is bonded to only one phosphorus atom. Let's call this unique phosphorus atom $P_A$. This substitution breaks the overall tetrahedral symmetry. The atom $P_A$ is now in a unique chemical environment. The other three phosphorus atoms ($P_B$, $P_C$, and $P_D$) remain bonded only to oxygen atoms and are equivalent to each other due to a remaining $C_3$ axis of symmetry passing through the $P_A$ atom. This results in two distinct sets of phosphorus atoms: one set containing the single unique atom $P_A$ and another set containing the three equivalent atoms. The predicted $^{31}$P NMR spectrum would therefore show **two resonances** with an integrated intensity ratio of **3:1**. This matches the experimental data.\n\n**Step 4: Predict the $^{31}$P NMR Spectrum for the Bridging Isomer**\nIf a sulfur atom replaces a bridging oxygen, it links two phosphorus atoms (e.g., $P_A$ and $P_B$). These two phosphorus atoms are now in an identical chemical environment, different from the remaining two phosphorus atoms ($P_C$ and $P_D$). The atoms $P_C$ and $P_D$ are also equivalent to each other by symmetry (a $C_2$ axis bisects the P-S-P and P-P axes). This arrangement partitions the four phosphorus atoms into two sets of two. The predicted $^{31}$P NMR spectrum for this isomer would show **two resonances** with an integrated intensity ratio of **2:2**, which simplifies to **1:1**. This does not match the observed 3:1 ratio.\n\n**Step 5: Evaluate Other Possibilities and Conclude**\n- Option B (bridging isomer) is ruled out as it would give a 1:1 signal ratio.\n- Option D (dynamic equilibrium) would likely lead to broadened signals or a single averaged signal at room temperature, not two sharp resonances.\n- Option E (static mixture) is overly complicated. A 3:1 mixture of the bridging isomer (1:1 pattern) and terminal isomer (3:1 pattern) would produce a complex spectrum with up to four signals, not the simple two-signal pattern observed.\n\nThe only scenario that perfectly explains the observation of two sharp $^{31}$P NMR signals with a 3:1 intensity ratio is the formation of the terminal isomer, where the sulfur atom replaces a terminal oxygen.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2267326"}]}
