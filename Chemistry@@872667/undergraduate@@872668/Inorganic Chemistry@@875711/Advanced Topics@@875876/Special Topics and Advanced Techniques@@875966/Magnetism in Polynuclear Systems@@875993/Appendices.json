Mastering this straightforward addition of spin quantum numbers is the foundational step toward understanding the full range of magnetic behaviors in these systems [@problem_id:2266998].", "problem": "Single-Molecule Magnets (SMMs) are individual molecules that can function as tiny magnets. Their magnetic properties arise from the coupling of electron spins on multiple metal centers within the molecule. Consider a hypothetical molecular cluster with a cubane-like core structure, which contains four chromium(III) ions. In this cluster, each Cr(III) ion is in a high-spin electronic state, characterized by an individual spin quantum number $S = 3/2$. The overall magnetic behavior of the cluster depends on how these four individual spins couple with one another. What is the maximum possible value for the total spin quantum number, $S_T$, for the entire cluster?", "solution": "Each chromium(III) ion has spin quantum number $S=\\frac{3}{2}$. The total spin quantum number $S_{T}$ of the cluster is obtained by successive addition of angular momenta following the quantum mechanical spin-coupling rules. For two spins $S_{a}$ and $S_{b}$, the resultant spin $S_{ab}$ can take all values from $|S_{a}-S_{b}|$ to $S_{a}+S_{b}$ in integer steps. The maximum possible resultant is therefore the sum $S_{a}+S_{b}$.\n\nApplying this iteratively to four identical spins $S=\\frac{3}{2}$:\n1) Combine the first two spins to get a maximum $S_{12}^{\\max} = \\frac{3}{2} + \\frac{3}{2} = 3$.\n2) Add the third spin to this maximum to get $S_{123}^{\\max} = 3 + \\frac{3}{2} = \\frac{9}{2}$.\n3) Add the fourth spin to obtain the overall maximum $S_{T}^{\\max} = \\frac{9}{2} + \\frac{3}{2} = 6$.\n\nEquivalently, for $N$ spins each of magnitude $S$, the maximum total spin is $\\sum_{i=1}^{N} S_{i} = N S$, giving here $S_{T}^{\\max} = 4 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 6$.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible value of the total spin quantum number for the cluster is $S_{T}=6$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{6}$$", "id": "2266998"}, {"introduction": "In contrast to the ferromagnetic case, antiferromagnetic coupling is an extremely common interaction where adjacent spins align in an antiparallel fashion.
