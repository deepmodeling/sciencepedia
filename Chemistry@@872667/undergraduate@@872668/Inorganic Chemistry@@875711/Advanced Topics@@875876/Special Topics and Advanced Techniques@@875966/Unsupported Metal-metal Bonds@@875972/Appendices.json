Principles used:\n- A group 7 metal center contributes $7$ valence electrons.\n- Each terminal carbonyl ligand, CO, donates $2$ electrons.\n- A metal–metal single bond is a $2$-electron bond shared between two metals; when counting per metal center, it contributes $1$ electron to each metal.\n\nFor $Mn_{2}(CO)_{10}$:\n- Each $Mn$ is group $7$, so contributes $7$ electrons.\n- Each $Mn$ is bound to $5$ CO ligands, contributing $5 \\times 2 = 10$ electrons.\n- The $Mn{-}Mn$ bond contributes $1$ electron per $Mn$ center.\nTherefore, the valence electron count per $Mn$ center is\n$$\n7 + 10 + 1 = 18.\n$$\nAn $18$-electron configuration is a closed shell; thus each $Mn$ center is diamagnetic, and the whole molecule is diamagnetic.\n\nEquivalently, the total valence electron count for the dimer is\n$$\n2 \\times 7 + 10 \\times 2 = 34,\n$$\nwhich is consistent with two $18$-electron centers and a closed-shell, diamagnetic species.\n\nFor the monomeric radical fragment $Mn(CO)_{5}$:\n- The $Mn$ center contributes $7$ electrons.\n- The $5$ CO ligands contribute $5 \\times 2 = 10$ electrons.\n- There is no metal–metal bond.\nThus, the valence electron count is\n$$\n7 + 10 = 17,\n$$\nwhich is an odd-electron configuration, implying one unpaired electron and hence a paramagnetic radical.\n\nTherefore, $Mn_{2}(CO)_{10}$ is diamagnetic and $Mn(CO)_{5}$ is paramagnetic, matching option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2297285"}, {"introduction": "The 18-electron rule is a powerful predictive tool for organometallic chemists. Before embarking on a complex synthesis, chemists often use this rule to assess the viability of a proposed molecular structure.

The structure is believed to consist of two identical $(C_5H_5)Cr(CO)_3$ units linked by a direct, unsupported chromium-chromium bond. To assess the viability of this structure, the 18-electron rule is a useful guideline.\n\nFor the purpose of electron counting using the neutral ligand model, consider the following:\n- A neutral chromium (Cr) atom is in Group 6 of the periodic table and contributes 6 valence electrons.\n- The cyclopentadienyl ligand, denoted as Cp or $(C_5H_5)$, is a 5-electron donor.\n- Each carbonyl ligand (CO) is a 2-electron donor.\n\nAssuming the dimer forms and each chromium center must achieve a stable 18-electron configuration, determine the formal bond order of the chromium-chromium bond. Your answer should be a dimensionless integer.", "solution": "Use the neutral ligand electron counting and the 18-electron rule for each chromium center. For one $\\mathrm{Cr}$ in $\\left[(\\mathrm{C}_{5}\\mathrm{H}_{5})\\mathrm{Cr}(\\mathrm{CO})_{3}\\right]_{2}$, the total electron count is the sum of the metal valence electrons, the ligand donations, and the contribution from the metal-metal bond.
