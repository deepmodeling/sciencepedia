In this geometry, there are two distinct ligand environments: two axial ligands and three equatorial ligands.\n\nA variable-temperature Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) study is performed on a solution of $[\\mathrm{M(L)}_5]$. At low temperatures, the spectrum shows two distinct signals with an intensity ratio of 2:3, corresponding to the axial and equatorial ligands, respectively. As the temperature is raised, these two signals broaden, coalesce, and eventually sharpen into a single resonance at high temperatures.
