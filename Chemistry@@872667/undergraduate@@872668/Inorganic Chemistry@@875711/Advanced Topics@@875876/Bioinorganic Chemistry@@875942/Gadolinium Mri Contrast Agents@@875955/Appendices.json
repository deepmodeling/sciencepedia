To enhance the clarity of MRI scans, contrast agents are often administered to patients. One of the most common classes of contrast agents is based on the gadolinium(III) ion, $Gd^{3+}$. The effectiveness of $Gd^{3+}$ as a contrast agent is directly related to its large magnetic moment, which influences the relaxation times of water protons in its vicinity, leading to a brighter signal in the image.\n\nGadolinium (Gd) is a lanthanide element with atomic number 64.

By determining the coordination number, metal oxidation state, and overall charge, you will build a structural understanding of how chelating ligands create a stable \"cage\" for the gadolinium ion.", "problem": "Gadolinium-based complexes are a class of contrast agents used in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), a non-invasive medical imaging technique. For safe in vivo applications, the gadolinium ion, which is toxic in its free state, must be tightly bound by a chelating ligand. One of the most stable and widely used chelating agents is DOTA, which stands for 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid. The structure of DOTA consists of a macrocyclic ring containing four nitrogen atoms, with a carboxylic acid group attached to each nitrogen.\n\nIn the formation of the MRI contrast agent, a gadolinium ion is complexed by a single, fully deprotonated DOTA ligand. Additionally, a single water molecule binds directly to the central gadolinium ion to complete its primary coordination sphere. Assume the gadolinium ion adopts its most common and stable oxidation state.\n\nBased on this information, which of the following options correctly identifies the coordination number of the gadolinium ion, the oxidation state of the gadolinium ion, and the overall charge of the resulting $[\\text{Gd(DOTA)(H}_2\\text{O)}]$ complex?\n\nA.

Coordination Number: 8, Gd Oxidation State: +4, Overall Charge: 0", "solution": "We identify three quantities: the coordination number (CN), the oxidation state of gadolinium, and the overall charge of the complex.\n\nFirst, the coordination number is defined as the total number of donor atoms directly bonded to the metal in its primary coordination sphere. A fully deprotonated DOTA ligand donates eight donor atoms to the metal center (four ring nitrogens and four carboxylate oxygens), making it octadentate. In the given complex, there is one additional bound water molecule acting as a neutral monodentate ligand, contributing one more donor atom. Therefore, the total coordination number is\n$$\n\\text{CN} = 8 + 1 = 9.\n$$\n\nSecond, for the oxidation state, let the oxidation state of gadolinium be $x$, the charge on fully deprotonated DOTA be $-4$, and the charge on coordinated water be $0$. Let $Q$ be the overall charge of the complex. Charge balance gives\n$$\nx + (-4) + 0 = Q.\n$$\nGadolinium in MRI contrast agents adopts its most common and stable oxidation state $+3$, so set $x=+3$.

This exercise explores the critical role of water exchange kinetics in the inner-sphere relaxation mechanism, a key process by which the gadolinium complex enhances the MRI signal of surrounding water [@problem_id:2254699]. By considering a hypothetical scenario of an infinitely fast exchange rate, you will probe the delicate balance of kinetic parameters that chemists must optimize to design high-performance contrast agents.", "problem": "Gadolinium(III) complexes are widely used as contrast agents in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Their efficacy is quantified by their relaxivity ($r_1$), which measures the enhancement of the longitudinal relaxation rate ($1/T_1$) of water protons in their vicinity. A primary mechanism for this enhancement is the inner-sphere mechanism, where one or more water molecules directly coordinate to the paramagnetic $Gd(III)$ center. The overall process involves two key steps: (1) rapid relaxation of the protons of the bound water molecule due to its proximity to the $Gd(III)$ ion, and (2) exchange of this \"hyper-relaxed\" water molecule with water molecules in the bulk solvent.\n\nThe efficiency of this inner-sphere contribution to relaxivity is governed by several dynamic parameters, most notably the rotational correlation time of the complex ($\\tau_R$) and the residence lifetime of the inner-sphere water molecule ($\\tau_M$). The residence lifetime is the average time a water molecule spends coordinated to the $Gd(III)$ ion and is the inverse of the first-order water exchange rate constant, $k_{ex}$ (i.e., $\\tau_M = 1/k_{ex}$).\n\nConsider a hypothetical scenario where the water exchange rate ($k_{ex}$) of a typical $Gd(III)$-based contrast agent could be tuned. If this exchange rate were increased to be infinitely fast ($k_{ex} \\to \\infty$), what would be the predicted effect on the inner-sphere contribution to the total relaxivity ($r_1$)?\n\nSelect the correct outcome from the options below.\n\nA. The inner-sphere contribution to relaxivity would increase without bound, approaching infinity.\nB. The inner-sphere contribution to relaxivity would decrease, approaching zero.\nC. The inner-sphere contribution to relaxivity would reach a maximum, finite value determined by other parameters such as the rotational correlation time.\nD. The inner-sphere contribution to relaxivity would become negative, leading to signal suppression.\nE. The water exchange rate is not mechanistically linked to the inner-sphere contribution to relaxivity.", "solution": "The inner-sphere contribution to relaxivity ($r_{1,\\text{IS}}$) is described by the Swift-Connick equation, which relates the relaxivity to the dynamics of the inner-sphere water molecule(s). A simplified form of the equation is:\n\n$$\nr_{1,\\text{IS}} = \\frac{q}{[\\text{H}_2\\text{O}]} \\left( \\frac{1}{T_{1m} + \\tau_m} \\right)\n$$\n\nwhere:\n- $q$ is the number of inner-sphere water molecules.\n- $[\\text{H}_2\\text{O}]$ is the molar concentration of water (approximately 55.5 M).\n- $T_{1m}$ is the longitudinal relaxation time of the water protons while they are bound to the Gd(III) center. This value is determined by factors like the rotational correlation time ($\\tau_R$) and is considered constant for this problem.\n- $\\tau_m$ is the residence lifetime of the bound water molecule, which is the inverse of the water exchange rate ($ \\tau_m = 1/k_{ex} $).\n\nThe problem asks for the effect on relaxivity as the water exchange rate becomes infinitely fast, i.e., $k_{ex} \\to \\infty$. This corresponds to the residence lifetime approaching zero, $\\tau_m \\to 0$.\n\nLet's analyze the limit of the equation as $\\tau_m \\to 0$:\n\n$$\n\\lim_{\\tau_m \\to 0} r_{1,\\text{IS}} = \\lim_{\\tau_m \\to 0} \\frac{q}{[\\text{H}_2\\text{O}]} \\left( \\frac{1}{T_{1m} + \\tau_m} \\right) = \\frac{q}{[\\text{H}_2\\text{O}]} \\left( \\frac{1}{T_{1m} + 0} \\right) = \\frac{q}{[\\text{H}_2\\text{O}] T_{1m}}\n$$\n\nThis result shows that as the exchange rate becomes infinitely fast, the inner-sphere relaxivity does not go to zero or infinity. Instead, it approaches a constant, finite maximum value known as the \"fast-exchange limit.\" In this regime, the overall relaxation process is no longer limited by how quickly water molecules can exchange, but by how quickly the bound water protons can relax (i.e., by $T_{1m}$). Physically, even though each water molecule spends a vanishingly small time bound to the gadolinium, the rate of exchange is so high that the relaxation effect is efficiently propagated to the bulk water.\n\nTherefore, the inner-sphere contribution to relaxivity would reach a maximum, finite value determined by other parameters like $q$ and $T_{1m}$ (which in turn depends on $\\tau_R$).
