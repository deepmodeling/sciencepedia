The provided trans-directing series is $\\text{Cl}^- > \\text{NH}_3$. This means that $\\text{Cl}^-$ has a stronger effect in labilizing the ligand trans to it than $\\text{NH}_3$ does.\n\n**Analysis of Pathway A**\n\n1.  **Starting Material:** The reaction begins with the square planar complex $[\\text{PtCl}_4]^{2-}$. All four ligands are identical ($\\text{Cl}^-$), so all positions are equivalent.\n    \n2.  **First Substitution:** The first molecule of ammonia ($\\text{NH}_3$) substitutes one of the chloride ligands. Since all positions are equivalent, the choice of which $\\text{Cl}^-$ to replace is random. This step forms the intermediate complex $[\\text{Pt}(\\text{NH}_3)\\text{Cl}_3]^-$.\n    $$[\\text{PtCl}_4]^{2-} + \\text{NH}_3 \\rightarrow [\\text{Pt}(\\text{NH}_3)\\text{Cl}_3]^{-} + \\text{Cl}^{-}$$\n    \n3.  **Second Substitution:** Now, a second molecule of $\\text{NH}_3$ must substitute another $\\text{Cl}^-$ ligand in the $[\\text{Pt}(\\text{NH}_3)\\text{Cl}_3]^-$ complex. In this intermediate, there are three $\\text{Cl}^-$ ligands. Two are positioned *cis* to the $\\text{NH}_3$ ligand, and one is positioned *trans* to the $\\text{NH}_3$ ligand. To determine which $\\text{Cl}^-$ is replaced, we must consider the trans effect of the ligands already present.\n    \n    The ligands directing the substitution are the $\\text{NH}_3$ and the two $\\text{Cl}^-$ ligands that are cis to the first $\\text{NH}_3$.\n    - The $\\text{NH}_3$ ligand labilizes the $\\text{Cl}^-$ ligand trans to it.\n    - The two $\\text{Cl}^-$ ligands that are cis to the $\\text{NH}_3$ labilize the other $\\text{Cl}^-$ ligands that are trans to them.\n    \n    According to the given series $\\text{Cl}^- > \\text{NH}_3$, the chloride ligand is a stronger trans-director than the ammonia ligand. Therefore, a $\\text{Cl}^-$ ligand is more effective at labilizing its trans partner than an $\\text{NH}_3$ ligand is. The incoming $\\text{NH}_3$ will preferentially substitute a $\\text{Cl}^-$ that is trans to another $\\text{Cl}^-$, rather than the $\\text{Cl}^-$ that is trans to the $\\text{NH}_3$.\n    \n    A $\\text{Cl}^-$ that is trans to another $\\text{Cl}^-$ is, by definition, located at a position *cis* to the first $\\text{NH}_3$ ligand.

In this intermediate, there are three $\\text{NH}_3$ ligands. Two are positioned *cis* to the $\\text{Cl}^-$ ligand, and one is positioned *trans* to the $\\text{Cl}^-$ ligand. We must analyze the trans effect to determine which $\\text{NH}_3$ is replaced.\n    \n    The ligands directing the substitution are the $\\text{Cl}^-$ and the two $\\text{NH}_3$ ligands that are cis to the $\\text{Cl}^-$.\n    - The $\\text{Cl}^-$ ligand labilizes the $\\text{NH}_3$ ligand trans to it.\n    - The $\\text{NH}_3$ ligands labilize the other $\\text{NH}_3$ ligands trans to them.\n    \n    From the trans-directing series $\\text{Cl}^- > \\text{NH}_3$, the $\\text{Cl}^-$ ligand is the strongest trans-director present in the complex.
