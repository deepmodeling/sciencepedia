[Xe] $4f^{9} 6s^{1}$", "solution": "The problem asks for the ground-state electronic configuration of the most common stable ion of holmium (Ho).\n\nFirst, let's determine the electronic configuration of a neutral holmium atom. Holmium has an atomic number $Z=67$. The noble gas preceding the lanthanide series is Xenon (Xe), which has an atomic number $Z=54$. The electron configuration for Xe is $1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^6 3d^{10} 4s^2 4p^6 4d^{10} 5s^2 5p^6$. We can use [Xe] to represent this core. We need to place the remaining $67 - 54 = 13$ electrons into the available orbitals. For the lanthanides (period 6), the orbitals being filled after Xenon are the $6s$, $4f$, and $5d$ orbitals. According to the Aufbau principle and the observed configurations for lanthanides, the two $6s$ electrons are filled first, and the remaining electrons go into the $4f$ subshell. Thus, for holmium, the electronic configuration of the neutral atom is [Xe] $4f^{11} 6s^{2}$.\n\nNext, we must identify the most common stable ion of holmium. For the lanthanide series, the most characteristic and stable oxidation state is +3. This arises from the relatively low energy cost to remove the two outermost $6s$ electrons and one electron from the $4f$ subshell (or a $5d$ electron if present), which leads to a tripositive ion, $\\text{Ln}^{3+}$. Although other oxidation states like +2 and +4 exist for a few lanthanides (e.g., $\\text{Eu}^{2+}$, $\\text{Ce}^{4+}$), the +3 state is overwhelmingly the most stable for holmium.\n\nNow, we determine the electronic configuration of the $\\text{Ho}^{3+}$ ion. When a cation is formed from a neutral atom, electrons are removed from the orbitals with the highest principal quantum number ($n$) first. In the case of holmium, [Xe] $4f^{11} 6s^{2}$, the outermost electrons are in the $n=6$ shell (the $6s$ orbital), while the $f$-electrons are in the $n=4$ shell.\n\nTo form the $\\text{Ho}^{3+}$ ion, we must remove three electrons.\n1.  The first two electrons are removed from the highest principal quantum number orbital, which is the $6s$ orbital. Removing these two electrons gives the configuration for $\\text{Ho}^{2+}$: [Xe] $4f^{11}$.\n2.  The third electron must be removed from the next highest energy subshell, which is the $4f$ subshell. Removing one electron from the $4f^{11}$ configuration leaves us with $4f^{10}$.\n\nTherefore, the final electronic configuration for the most stable ion of holmium, $\\text{Ho}^{3+}$, is [Xe] $4f^{10}$.\n\nLet's review the options provided:\nA. [Xe] $4f^{11} 6s^{2}$: This is the configuration of the neutral Ho atom.\nB. [Xe] $4f^{11}$: This is the configuration of the $\\text{Ho}^{2+}$ ion. While plausible, +2 is not the most stable oxidation state for holmium.\nC. [Xe] $4f^{10}$: This is the configuration of the $\\text{Ho}^{3+}$ ion, which corresponds to the correct removal of three electrons.\nD. [Xe] $4f^{8} 6s^{2}$: This would result from incorrectly removing three electrons from the $4f$ subshell first, which violates the rule of removing electrons from the highest $n$ shell first.\nE. [Xe] $4f^{9} 6s^{1}$: This configuration is not a stable ground state for either the neutral atom or any common ion.\n\nThe correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2249920"}, {"introduction": "Moving from abstract configurations to tangible properties, we can explore the link between electronic structure and magnetism.
