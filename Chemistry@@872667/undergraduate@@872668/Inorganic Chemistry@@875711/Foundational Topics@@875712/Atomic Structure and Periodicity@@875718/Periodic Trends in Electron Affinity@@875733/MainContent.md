## Introduction
While much of chemistry focuses on the energy required to remove electrons, a full understanding of [chemical reactivity](@entry_id:141717) also requires knowing an atom's ability to accept them. This fundamental property is quantified by electron affinity, the energy change that occurs when an isolated atom in the gaseous state gains an electron. Understanding the principles that govern electron affinity allows us to predict the stability of [anions](@entry_id:166728), the nature of chemical bonds, and the properties of materials. This article addresses the key factors behind this property, explaining the predictable patterns—and the crucial exceptions—that emerge across the periodic table.

This article will guide you through a comprehensive exploration of electron affinity. In the first chapter, **Principles and Mechanisms**, we will define electron affinity, examine the atomic factors that control it, and map out its general trends and important anomalies. The second chapter, **Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections**, will demonstrate how this atomic property is essential for understanding the thermodynamics of bonding, the behavior of semiconductors, and the reactivity of molecules. Finally, the **Hands-On Practices** section will allow you to apply these concepts to solve targeted problems, reinforcing your understanding of this core chemical principle.

## Principles and Mechanisms

### Defining Electron Affinity: A Quantitative Measure of Electron Attraction

While [ionization energy](@entry_id:136678) quantifies the energy required to remove an electron from an atom, **electron affinity (EA)** addresses the inverse process: the energy change associated with a neutral atom in the gaseous state gaining an electron. This fundamental property provides a direct measure of an atom's ability to accommodate an additional electron to form a negative ion, or anion. The process is represented by the following equation:

$$X(g) + e^- \to X^-(g)$$

There are two common sign conventions for electron affinity in scientific literature, which can be a source of confusion. The convention endorsed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) defines [electron affinity](@entry_id:147520) as the energy *released* when the electron is added. In this framework, a process that is energetically favorable and releases energy (i.e., is exothermic) is assigned a **positive** [electron affinity](@entry_id:147520) value. Conversely, a process that requires an input of energy to occur (i.e., is endothermic) is assigned a **negative** electron affinity.

An alternative convention, frequently used in physics and physical chemistry, defines electron affinity as the change in energy, $\Delta E$, for the process. Following thermodynamic standard states, an [exothermic process](@entry_id:147168) has a negative $\Delta E$, and an [endothermic process](@entry_id:141358) has a positive $\Delta E$. In this article, we will consistently adhere to the IUPAC definition. The relationship between our definition of [electron affinity](@entry_id:147520) ($EA$) and the enthalpy change for the process ($\Delta H_{EA}$) is therefore straightforward:

$$\Delta H_{EA} = -EA$$

A positive electron affinity signifies that the resulting anion, $X^-$, is thermodynamically stable with respect to the separated neutral atom and a free electron. A large positive EA indicates a strong affinity for the electron and the formation of a very stable anion. For example, chlorine has a high [electron affinity](@entry_id:147520) ($EA = +349 \text{ kJ/mol}$). The formation of a chloride ion is an [exothermic process](@entry_id:147168) ($\Delta H_{EA} = -349 \text{ kJ/mol}$), indicating that the $Cl^-(g)$ ion is more stable than the $Cl(g)$ atom and a free electron [@problem_id:2278737].

Conversely, a negative electron affinity signifies that the process is endothermic. Energy must be supplied to force the electron onto the atom, and the resulting anion is thermodynamically unstable, spontaneously ejecting the electron if left in isolation. For instance, a noble gas like neon has a stable, closed-shell [electron configuration](@entry_id:147395). Adding an electron is highly unfavorable, resulting in a negative [electron affinity](@entry_id:147520) ($EA = -116 \text{ kJ/mol}$). This means the process is endothermic ($\Delta H_{EA} = +116 \text{ kJ/mol}$), and the neonide ion, $Ne^-(g)$, is unstable [@problem_id:2278737] [@problem_id:2278746].

The relationship between electron affinity and ionization energy can be further clarified by considering the reverse process. The [first ionization energy](@entry_id:136840) of an anion ($I_{E1}(X^-)$) is the energy required to remove an electron from it:

$$X^-(g) \to X(g) + e^-$$

This is precisely the reverse of the electron attachment process. Consequently, the energy required to remove the electron from the anion is exactly equal to the energy released when the neutral atom gained it. This leads to the simple and powerful identity [@problem_id:2278702]:

$$I_{E1}(X^-) = EA(X)$$

### The Interplay of Forces: Factors Governing Electron Affinity

The magnitude and sign of an element's [electron affinity](@entry_id:147520) are determined by a delicate balance of several fundamental factors related to [atomic structure](@entry_id:137190).

1.  **Effective Nuclear Charge ($Z_{eff}$)**: This is the net positive charge experienced by an electron in an atom. The "effective" charge is less than the full nuclear charge ($Z$) due to the screening or [shielding effect](@entry_id:136974) of other electrons. A higher $Z_{eff}$ experienced by an incoming electron results in a stronger electrostatic attraction to the nucleus, which favors a more exothermic (larger positive) electron affinity.

2.  **Principal Quantum Number ($n$)**: The incoming electron must occupy the lowest-energy available atomic orbital. The [principal quantum number](@entry_id:143678), $n$, of this valence shell determines its average distance from the nucleus. As $n$ increases, the average radius of the orbital increases significantly. An electron that is, on average, farther from the nucleus experiences a weaker attraction, which favors a less exothermic (smaller positive) [electron affinity](@entry_id:147520).

3.  **Electron-Electron Repulsion**: The incoming electron is repelled by the electrons already present in the atom's valence shell. This repulsion is a destabilizing effect that counteracts the attraction from the nucleus. The magnitude of this repulsion is highly sensitive to the size and occupancy of the valence orbitals. In smaller, more compact orbitals, the average distance between electrons is shorter, leading to much stronger repulsion.

4.  **Electronic Configuration**: Configurations with filled ($ns^2$, $np^6$) or half-filled ($np^3$) subshells possess a special quantum mechanical stability due to maximized [exchange energy](@entry_id:137069) and symmetrical charge distribution. Processes that disrupt these stable configurations are energetically penalized, while processes that create them are often favored.

### General Periodic Trends in Electron Affinity

The interplay of these factors gives rise to distinct, predictable trends in electron affinity across the periodic table, although these trends are punctuated by important exceptions.

#### Trend Across a Period

As one moves from left to right across a period, the **electron affinity generally becomes more exothermic (i.e., the EA value increases)**. The primary reason for this trend is the steady increase in **[effective nuclear charge](@entry_id:143648) ($Z_{eff}$)**. Within the same period, electrons are added to orbitals with the same [principal quantum number](@entry_id:143678) ($n$), so the [atomic radius](@entry_id:139257) decreases only slightly. The increasing nuclear pull is therefore the dominant factor, leading to a stronger attraction for an incoming electron and a greater release of energy.

The relationship between $EA$ and $Z_{eff}$ can be approximated by simple models. For example, a hypothetical linear relationship for elements in the third period ($n=3$) of the form $EA = k(Z_{eff}/n^2) + E_0$ can be used. Using experimental data for Silicon ($Z_{eff} \approx 4.15$, $EA = 133.6 \text{ kJ/mol}$) and Sulfur ($Z_{eff} \approx 5.45$, $EA = 200.4 \text{ kJ/mol}$), we can predict the electron affinity of Chlorine ($Z_{eff} \approx 6.10$). The increase in EA clearly tracks the increase in $Z_{eff}$, yielding a predicted value for chlorine of $233.8 \text{ kJ/mol}$, which is in reasonable agreement with the trend [@problem_id:2278726].

#### Trend Down a Group

As one moves down a group, the **electron affinity generally becomes less exothermic (i.e., the EA value decreases)**. While the nuclear charge increases, the overriding factor is that the incoming electron must occupy a valence shell with a progressively higher **principal quantum number ($n$)** [@problem_id:2278704]. An electron entering the $n=5$ shell of rubidium is, on average, much farther from the nucleus than an electron entering the $n=2$ shell of lithium. This increased distance significantly weakens the electrostatic attraction, causing less energy to be released upon [electron capture](@entry_id:158629). For instance, the electron affinities of the [alkali metals](@entry_id:139133) decrease from Lithium ($+60 \text{ kJ/mol}$) to Cesium ($+46 \text{ kJ/mol}$).

### Key Anomalies and Exceptions: Revealing Deeper Principles

The true richness of [electron affinity](@entry_id:147520) trends is found in the exceptions. These "anomalies" are not random; they provide profound insights into the importance of electron configuration and electron-electron repulsion.

#### The Low Affinities of Group 2 and Group 18 Elements

There is a dramatic drop in electron affinity when moving from Group 1 to Group 2, and again when approaching the noble gases (Group 18). Elements in these groups—such as Beryllium ($ns^2$) and Neon ($ns^2np^6$)—have stable, filled valence subshells.

-   **Group 1 ($ns^1$)**: Adding an electron creates a stable, filled $ns^2$ subshell, a favorable process resulting in an exothermic EA [@problem_id:2278703].
-   **Group 2 ($ns^2$)**: The $ns$ subshell is already full. The incoming electron is forced to occupy a new, significantly higher-energy $p$ subshell. This energy cost makes the process endothermic (negative EA) [@problem_id:2278703].
-   **Group 18 ($ns^2np^6$)**: Similarly, the [noble gases](@entry_id:141583) have a completely filled valence shell. The next electron must enter the next principal quantum shell, $(n+1)s$, which is extremely energetically unfavorable. Consequently, noble gases have negative electron affinities [@problem_id:2278746].

#### The Dip at Group 15

A similar, though less dramatic, exception occurs in Group 15. These elements (e.g., Nitrogen, Phosphorus) have a valence configuration of $ns^2np^3$. This **half-filled p-subshell** is particularly stable due to maximized [exchange energy](@entry_id:137069) (Hund's Rule). When an electron is added to a Group 15 element, it must be placed into a p-orbital that is already occupied by one electron. This has two negative energetic consequences: it disrupts the stability of the half-filled subshell, and it introduces **pairing energy**, the [electrostatic repulsion](@entry_id:162128) between two electrons confined to the same orbital. This energy cost makes the electron affinity of Group 15 elements significantly less exothermic than their neighbors in Group 14 and Group 16 [@problem_id:2278723]. For Nitrogen, this effect is so pronounced that its electron affinity is negative, and the $N^-(g)$ ion is unstable [@problem_id:2278746].

#### The Halogen Anomaly: Fluorine vs. Chlorine

Based on the general trend down a group, one would expect fluorine to have a more exothermic electron affinity than chlorine. Experimentally, the reverse is true: $EA(Cl) = +349 \text{ kJ/mol}$ while $EA(F) = +328 \text{ kJ/mol}$. This important anomaly is a direct consequence of electron-electron repulsion in a highly compact space.

The valence shell of fluorine ($n=2$) is exceptionally small. While fluorine's high effective nuclear charge strongly attracts an incoming electron, the seven existing valence electrons are packed into a very small volume. The resulting high electron density causes significant repulsion against the eighth incoming electron. In chlorine, the electron enters the larger, more diffuse $n=3$ shell. Although the electron is farther from the nucleus, the [electron-electron repulsion](@entry_id:154978) is substantially reduced. In this specific case, the reduction in repulsion in the larger shell is a more significant energetic factor than the increased distance from the nucleus, making the overall process more exothermic for chlorine than for fluorine [@problem_id:2278757].

### Higher-Order Electron Affinities

It is also possible to add more than one electron to an atom. The **[second electron affinity](@entry_id:138138) ($EA_2$)** is the energy associated with adding an electron to a 1- anion:

$$X^-(g) + e^- \to X^{2-}(g)$$

A universal principle applies here: **the [second electron affinity](@entry_id:138138) of any element is always endothermic (negative EA)**. The reason is purely electrostatic. The incoming electron, which is negatively charged, must overcome the strong Coulombic repulsion from the net negative charge of the anion it is approaching. An enormous amount of energy is required to force the electron onto the already-negative ion [@problem_id:2278719]. For example, while the [first electron affinity](@entry_id:156805) of oxygen is exothermic ($EA_1 = +141 \text{ kJ/mol}$), the [second electron affinity](@entry_id:138138) is strongly endothermic ($EA_2 \approx -780 \text{ kJ/mol}$) [@problem_id:2278746]. This illustrates that while ions like $O^{2-}(g)$ and $S^{2-}(g)$ are unstable in isolation, their existence in stable [ionic compounds](@entry_id:137573) like MgO and Na₂S is due to the massive stabilizing energy provided by the crystal lattice, which far outweighs the endothermic cost of forming the gaseous dianion.

### Electron Affinity vs. Electronegativity: A Crucial Distinction

Students often confuse [electron affinity](@entry_id:147520) with **[electronegativity](@entry_id:147633)**. While both relate to an atom's attraction for electrons, they describe fundamentally different scenarios and must be distinguished [@problem_id:2278745].

-   **Electron Affinity** is a precisely defined, experimentally measurable quantity of energy (e.g., in kJ/mol or eV). It pertains to an **isolated atom in the gaseous state** gaining a free electron.
-   **Electronegativity** is a relative, calculated concept, often expressed on a dimensionless scale (e.g., the Pauling scale from 0 to 4). It describes the ability of an atom **within a chemical bond** to attract the shared electrons of that bond.

Fluorine serves as the perfect example to highlight this difference. Fluorine has the **highest [electronegativity](@entry_id:147633)** of any element, reflecting its unparalleled ability to polarize bonds and pull shared electron density towards itself in a molecule. However, fluorine does **not** have the highest [electron affinity](@entry_id:147520); chlorine does. The concepts are related but not interchangeable. Electronegativity describes an atom's behavior in the complex electronic environment of a molecule, whereas [electron affinity](@entry_id:147520) isolates a single event: the capture of a lone electron from a vacuum.
