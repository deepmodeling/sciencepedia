The definition of $l'$ depends on $n$ and $l$ as follows:\n    *   For principal quantum numbers $n=1$ and $n=2$, the ordering quantum number is identical to the angular momentum quantum number, $l' = l$.\n    *   For principal quantum numbers $n \\ge 3$:\n        *   if $l=0$ (s-orbitals), then $l'=1$.\n        *   if $l=1$ (p-orbitals), then $l'=0$.\n        *   if $l \\ge 2$ (d, f, ... orbitals), then $l' = l$.\n\n2.

To find this, we must first determine the electron orbital filling order in the hypothetical universe and then compare it, element by element, with the known filling order in our universe.\n\nFirst, let's establish the orbital filling order in the hypothetical universe using the given rules.
