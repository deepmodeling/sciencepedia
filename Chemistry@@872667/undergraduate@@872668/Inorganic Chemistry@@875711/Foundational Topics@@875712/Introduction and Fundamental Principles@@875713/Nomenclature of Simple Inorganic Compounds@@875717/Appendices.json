This practice uses a real-world catalyst from the Contact process to demonstrate how to determine the metal's oxidation state from the chemical formula ($V_2O_5$) and apply the Stock system for correct naming [@problem_id:2273829]. Mastering this principle is fundamental for unambiguous communication in inorganic chemistry.", "problem": "The Contact process is a cornerstone of modern chemical manufacturing, responsible for the large-scale production of sulfuric acid. A critical step in this process is the oxidation of sulfur dioxide ($SO_2$) to sulfur trioxide ($SO_3$) in the presence of a catalyst. This catalytic material is a solid compound with the chemical formula $V_2O_5$.\n\nWhat is the correct systematic name for the compound $V_2O_5$ according to the Stock system of nomenclature?\n\nA. Vanadium oxide\n\nB. Vanadium(II) oxide\n\nC. Divanadium pentoxide\n\nD. Vanadium(V) oxide\n\nE. Vanadium(V) pentoxide", "solution": "In a neutral compound, the sum of oxidation states of all atoms equals zero. Oxygen in oxides has an oxidation state of $-2$. For $V_{2}O_{5}$, let the oxidation state of each vanadium be $x$. With two vanadium atoms and five oxygen atoms, the sum of oxidation states is\n$$2x + 5(-2) = 0.$$\nSolving,\n$$2x - 10 = 0 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; 2x = 10 \\;\\Rightarrow\\; x = +5.$$\nAccording to the Stock system, the compound is named as the element followed by its oxidation state in Roman numerals in parentheses, then the anion type. Therefore, $V_{2}O_{5}$ is named vanadium(V) oxide.

This exercise focuses on an interhalogen compound, iodine heptafluoride, to illustrate how to translate a systematic name directly into a chemical formula [@problem_id:2273814]. This practice solidifies the important distinction between the nomenclature for ionic and covalently bonded substances.", "problem": "Iodine heptafluoride is a dense, colorless gas at room temperature and one of the few known interhalogen compounds with a central atom in the +7 oxidation state. It is a powerful fluorinating agent and a subject of interest in studies of hypervalent molecules, as it provides a clear example of a molecule that deviates from the simple octet rule. Given its systematic name, what is the chemical formula for iodine heptafluoride?", "solution": "We interpret the systematic binary molecular name using standard nomenclature rules:\n- The first element named is iodine, so the central atom is iodine with symbol I.\n- The second part, \"fluoride,\" indicates fluorine as the other element with symbol F.\n- The Greek prefix \"hepta-\" specifies there are 7 fluorine atoms bonded to iodine.\n\nTherefore, the stoichiometric formula is $IF_{7}$, placing the less electronegative element (iodine) first.\n\nConsistency check via oxidation states:\nLet the oxidation state of iodine be $x$. Each fluorine has oxidation state $-1$, and the molecule is neutral, so\n$$x + 7(-1) = 0 \\implies x = +7,$$\nwhich matches the statement that the central atom is in the $+7$ oxidation state. Hence the name and formula are consistent.\n\nThus, the chemical formula for iodine heptafluoride is $IF_{7}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{IF_{7}}$$", "id": "2273814"}, {"introduction": "Real-world materials often contain more than just two types of ions, requiring a synthesis of multiple nomenclature rules. This problem presents a complex ionic compound containing both polyatomic and monatomic ions, challenging you to integrate several skills [@problem_id:2273839]. By determining the transition metal's oxidation state through charge balance and correctly ordering the different cations, you will learn to name intricate inorganic salts systematically.", "problem": "A materials science research group synthesizes a novel crystalline solid intended for use as a heterogeneous catalyst. Elemental analysis confirms that the compound is ionic and composed of only three distinct types of ions: ammonium cations ($NH_4^+$), phosphate anions ($PO_4^{3-}$), and titanium cations (Ti). Stoichiometric analysis of the crystal lattice reveals that for every one mole of titanium ions present, there are two moles of ammonium ions and two moles of phosphate ions.\n\nFor writing the chemical formula, assume the cations are listed alphabetically based on their names (i.e., Ammonium before Titanium).

The stoichiometric ratios are: per 1 mole of Ti, there are 2 moles of $NH_4^+$ and 2 moles of $PO_4^{3-}$. Let the titanium oxidation state be $x$.

The problem further specifies that when writing the chemical formula, cations are listed alphabetically based on their names (ammonium before titanium), so the ordering $(NH_4)_2Ti(PO_4)_2$ is correct; placing Ti first would violate the stated ordering rule.\n\nFor the IUPAC systematic name:\n- List cations in alphabetical order by name: ammonium, then titanium(IV).\n- Then list the anion: phosphate.\n- Do not use multiplicative prefixes like “di-” for simple salts; the stoichiometry is inferred from the charges. Moreover, “diphosphate” commonly denotes the pyrophosphate anion $P_2O_7^{4-}$, not two separate phosphate anions $PO_4^{3-}$.\n\nTherefore, the correct name is “ammonium titanium(IV) phosphate.”\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- A: Wrong cation order in the formula and name order.\n- B: Uses “diphosphate,” which denotes $P_2O_7^{4-}$ and is not appropriate here; also multiplicative prefixes are not used for such simple salts.\n- C: Correct formula ordering and correct IUPAC name.\n- D: Incorrect oxidation state (II instead of IV).\n- E: Incorrect stoichiometry and oxidation state.\n\nHence, option C is correct.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2273839"}]}
