Consider the simple hydrides silane ($SiH_4$) and phosphine ($PH_3$). You are provided with the following data:\n\n- Pauling electronegativity of Silicon (Si): 1.90\n- Pauling electronegativity of Phosphorus (P): 2.19\n- Pauling electronegativity of Hydrogen (H): 2.20\n- Molar mass of $SiH_4$: 32.12 g/mol\n- Molar mass of $PH_3$: 34.00 g/mol\n\nBased on a thorough analysis of the potential intermolecular forces for both molecules, predict their relative boiling points and select the option that provides the correct prediction and justification.\n\nA. Phosphine ($PH_3$) has a significantly higher boiling point than silane ($SiH_4$) because the phosphorus atom is electronegative enough to form strong hydrogen bonds.\n\nB. Silane ($SiH_4$) has a higher boiling point than phosphine ($PH_3$) because its symmetric tetrahedral structure allows for more effective London dispersion forces than the trigonal pyramidal phosphine.\n\nC. Phosphine ($PH_3$) has a higher boiling point than silane ($SiH_4$) because phosphine is a polar molecule exhibiting dipole-dipole interactions, whereas silane is nonpolar and only has London dispersion forces.\n\nD. Silane ($SiH_4$) and phosphine ($PH_3$) have nearly identical boiling points because their molar masses are very similar, leading to comparable London dispersion forces, and neither molecule can form hydrogen bonds.\n\nE. Silane ($SiH_4$) has a higher boiling point than phosphine ($PH_3$) because the Si-H bond is more polar than the P-H bond, leading to stronger overall intermolecular attractions.", "solution": "Intermolecular forces that can govern boiling points are, in increasing typical strength: London dispersion forces, dipole-dipole interactions, and hydrogen bonding. Hydrogen bonding requires hydrogen bonded to a strongly electronegative, small atom (typically N, O, or F) with a lone pair on a neighboring molecule to accept the hydrogen bond. Phosphorus and silicon do not meet this requirement, so neither $PH_3$ nor $SiH_4$ can form classical hydrogen bonds.\n\nAssess bond polarity via electronegativity. Let $\\chi(X)$ denote the Pauling electronegativity of element $X$. The data imply $\\chi(P) \\approx \\chi(H)$, so the $P-H$ bond dipole is very small. Also $\\chi(H) > \\chi(Si)$, so the $Si-H$ bond is polarized toward hydrogen. However, the molecular geometry determines whether bond dipoles cancel.\n\nFor $SiH_4$, the geometry is tetrahedral with four identical $Si-H$ bonds. By symmetry, the vector sum of the bond dipoles cancels, giving a nonpolar molecule with net dipole moment $\\mu \\approx 0$. Therefore, $SiH_4$ exhibits only London dispersion forces.\n\nFor $PH_3$, the geometry is trigonal pyramidal due to the lone pair on phosphorus (VSEPR). Even though each $P-H$ bond has very small polarity, the asymmetric pyramidal geometry and lone pair produce a small but nonzero molecular dipole moment $\\mu > 0$. Consequently, $PH_3$ exhibits dipole-dipole interactions in addition to London dispersion forces.\n\nCompare dispersion contributions. The molar masses $M(SiH_4)$ and $M(PH_3)$ are similar, so their London dispersion strengths are comparable; if anything, $PH_3$ is slightly heavier and has a lone pair-bearing, larger central atom, which can modestly increase polarizability and dispersion. The decisive difference is that $PH_3$ has dipole-dipole interactions while $SiH_4$ does not.\n\nTherefore, $PH_3$ should have the higher boiling point because it experiences both London dispersion and dipole-dipole interactions, whereas $SiH_4$ has only London dispersion. Evaluating the options:\n- A is incorrect: neither molecule hydrogen-bonds.\n- B is incorrect in both order and justification; $SiH_4$ does not gain stronger dispersion from symmetry, and it actually boils lower.\n- C is correct: $PH_3$ is (weakly) polar and has dipole-dipole interactions; $SiH_4$ is nonpolar and has only dispersion.\n- D is incorrect: similar masses do not make boiling points nearly identical when one species has dipole-dipole interactions.\n- E is incorrect: while $Si-H$ bonds are more polar than $P-H$ bonds, $SiH_4$ is overall nonpolar, so increased bond polarity does not translate into stronger intermolecular attractions.\n\nHence the correct choice is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2259216"}, {"introduction": "Understanding the directional nature of intermolecular forces is crucial for predicting how molecules arrange themselves in the liquid and solid states.

This exercise will sharpen your ability to visualize how molecular dipoles and the specific geometry of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors cooperate to produce an energetically favorable, linear supramolecular assembly.", "problem": "Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is a linear molecule with a significant dipole moment. In the liquid and solid states, HCN molecules associate with one another primarily through intermolecular forces to form larger structures. Consider the formation of a dimer from two individual HCN molecules. In the HCN molecule, the hydrogen atom is covalently bonded to the carbon atom, and the nitrogen atom possesses a lone pair of electrons.\n\nBased on the principles of molecular geometry and hydrogen bonding, which of the following descriptions represents the most energetically favorable and therefore the most plausible structure for the hydrogen cyanide dimer in the gas or liquid phase?\n\nA. A linear arrangement where the two HCN molecules are aligned \"head-to-tail\", with the hydrogen atom of the first molecule pointing directly at the nitrogen atom's lone pair of the second molecule, forming a single linear chain of atoms.\n\nB. An antiparallel displaced-stack arrangement where the two linear molecules lie approximately parallel but are offset and oriented in opposite directions to maximize electrostatic attraction between the positive (H-C) end of one molecule and the negative (N) end of the other.\n\nC. A T-shaped arrangement where the hydrogen atom of one molecule points perpendicularly towards the center of the π-electron system of the $C\\equiv N$ triple bond of the other molecule.\n\nD. A cyclic structure where the hydrogen of the first molecule is attracted to the nitrogen of the second, and the hydrogen of the second molecule is simultaneously attracted to the nitrogen of the first, forming a strained, four-membered ring.", "solution": "HCN is linear with the sequence H–C≡N. The nitrogen bears a lone pair aligned along the molecular axis, and the permanent dipole moment points from the hydrogen/carbon end toward nitrogen. Thus, the hydrogen bears partial positive character and nitrogen bears partial negative character. The C–H bond can act as a weak hydrogen-bond donor, while the nitrogen lone pair is a strong hydrogen-bond acceptor.\n\nHydrogen bonds are directional and are strongest when the donor–H–acceptor atoms are colinear. In HCN, the acceptor lone pair on N lies along the molecular axis, so the optimal hydrogen bond geometry places the C–H bond colinear with the N lone pair, i.e., an H⋯N contact with an angle near 180 degrees.\n\nElectrostatic dipole–dipole interactions further support this geometry. The interaction energy between two point dipoles is\n$$\nU=\\frac{1}{4\\pi \\varepsilon_{0} r^{3}}\\left(\\mathbf{\\mu}_{1}\\cdot \\mathbf{\\mu}_{2}-3(\\mathbf{\\mu}_{1}\\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}})(\\mathbf{\\mu}_{2}\\cdot \\hat{\\mathbf{r}})\\right).\n$$\nFor two colinear HCN dipoles aligned head-to-tail (same direction as the intermolecular axis), set $\\mathbf{\\mu}_{1}=\\mu\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$ and $\\mathbf{\\mu}_{2}=\\mu\\,\\hat{\\mathbf{r}}$.

Thus, a colinear head-to-tail arrangement is favored by dipole–dipole electrostatics, and it simultaneously maximizes hydrogen-bond directionality (N lone pair to C–H).\n\nEvaluate each option:\n\nA. Linear head-to-tail with the H of one HCN pointing at the N lone pair of the other places donor–H–acceptor colinear and the two dipoles colinear and aligned (attractive), thus maximizing both hydrogen-bond and dipole–dipole stabilization. This is the most favorable arrangement.\n\nB. Antiparallel displaced stacking sacrifices the linear hydrogen-bond geometry and, in the colinear limit, gives repulsive dipole–dipole interaction as shown above. Even with displacement, it lacks the strong directional hydrogen bond and is less favorable than A in gas or liquid.\n\nC. T-shaped C–H⋯π(C≡N) is weaker because the nitrile π-system is a poorer acceptor than the nitrogen lone pair, and the geometry is not aligned with the acceptor lone pair; this is less favorable than a linear C–H⋯N hydrogen bond.\n\nD. A cyclic dimer with two reciprocal C–H⋯N hydrogen bonds would impose a strained four-membered ring. Given the linearity requirement for strong hydrogen bonds, both H-bonds cannot be simultaneously close to 180 degrees without severe geometric distortion, making this arrangement much less favorable than a single linear H-bond.\n\nTherefore, the most plausible, lowest-energy dimer is the linear head-to-tail hydrogen-bonded structure.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2259206"}, {"introduction": "While we often focus on 'classical' hydrogen bonds involving N-H, O-H, or F-H groups, the concept is broader and includes weaker, 'non-classical' interactions that are critical in many chemical systems.
