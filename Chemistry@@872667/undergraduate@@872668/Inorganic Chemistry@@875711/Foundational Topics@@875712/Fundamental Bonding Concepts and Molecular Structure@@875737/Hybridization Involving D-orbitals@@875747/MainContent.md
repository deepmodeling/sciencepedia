## Introduction
The concept of [orbital hybridization](@entry_id:140298) within Valence Bond Theory offers a powerful explanation for the three-dimensional shapes of molecules. For many common compounds, mixing s and p orbitals to form sp, sp², and sp³ hybrids provides a satisfactory model consistent with the [octet rule](@entry_id:141395). However, a significant class of molecules, particularly those with central atoms from the third period and beyond, defy this rule by forming five, six, or even more bonds. This phenomenon of "[hypervalency](@entry_id:142714)," seen in stable compounds like phosphorus pentachloride (PCl₅) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF₆), necessitates an expansion of our simple bonding model.

This article delves into the extension of hybridization to include valence [d-orbitals](@entry_id:261792). We will first explore the foundational "Principles and Mechanisms" that govern sp³d and sp³d² [hybridization](@entry_id:145080) and the resulting molecular geometries. Next, in "Applications and Interdisciplinary Connections," we will see how this model is applied to predict structures and reactivity across main-group, coordination, and [solid-state chemistry](@entry_id:155824). Finally, "Hands-On Practices" will provide an opportunity to solidify these concepts through targeted problems.

## Principles and Mechanisms

The Valence Bond Theory, through the concept of [orbital hybridization](@entry_id:140298), provides a powerful framework for understanding the three-dimensional structure of molecules. For elements in the first and second periods of the periodic table, the octet rule is a reliable guide, and molecular geometries can be rationalized by considering the mixing of valence $s$ and $p$ orbitals to form $sp$, $sp^2$, and $sp^3$ hybrid sets. However, many compounds, particularly those with central atoms from the third period and below, defy the [octet rule](@entry_id:141395) by forming more than four chemical bonds. This phenomenon, often termed **[hypervalency](@entry_id:142714)**, necessitates an expansion of the simple hybridization model to include valence $d$-orbitals. This chapter elucidates the principles governing [hybridization](@entry_id:145080) schemes that involve $d$-orbitals, exploring the resulting molecular geometries and the energetic factors that both rationalize and limit this model.

### The Requirement for d-Orbital Participation

The capacity of an atom to form covalent bonds is fundamentally limited by the number of valence orbitals it has available for bonding. A central atom's valence shell, comprising one $s$ orbital and three $p$ orbitals, can be mixed to form a maximum of four hybrid orbitals ($sp^3$). This corresponds to the four electron domains required to satisfy the [octet rule](@entry_id:141395). For a central atom to accommodate five, six, or even more electron domains—as seen in molecules like phosphorus pentachloride ($PCl_5$) or sulfur hexafluoride ($SF_6$)—it must engage additional valence orbitals.

This is the central reason why [hypervalency](@entry_id:142714) is a phenomenon predominantly observed for elements in the third period and below. For these elements, the principal quantum number of the valence shell ($n \ge 3$) includes a subshell of $d$-orbitals. While these $d$-orbitals are empty and higher in energy than the corresponding $s$ and $p$ orbitals in an isolated atom, they are energetically accessible enough to participate in bonding. Consequently, the minimum number of electron domains that necessitates the inclusion of at least one $d$-orbital in a [hybridization](@entry_id:145080) scheme is five [@problem_id:2258534].

This principle starkly explains why nitrogen, in Period 2, does not form nitrogen pentachloride ($NCl_5$), while phosphorus, directly below it in Period 3, readily forms the stable molecule $PCl_5$ [@problem_id:2258474]. Nitrogen's valence shell is the $n=2$ shell, which contains only $2s$ and $2p$ orbitals; there are no $2d$ orbitals. It is therefore incapable of forming the five [hybrid orbitals](@entry_id:260757) needed to bond with five chlorine atoms. In contrast, phosphorus has vacant $3d$ orbitals in its valence shell, which can be incorporated into its hybridization scheme.

### Geometries from Five Electron Domains: $sp^3d$ Hybridization

When a central atom must accommodate five electron domains (which can be a combination of bonding pairs and lone pairs), it utilizes one $s$, three $p$, and one $d$ orbital to create a set of five equivalent **$sp^3d$ [hybrid orbitals](@entry_id:260757)**. The lowest energy arrangement for five electron domains, as predicted by Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory, is the **[trigonal bipyramidal](@entry_id:141216) (TBP)** geometry.

This geometry is unique among the basic shapes because it possesses two distinct types of positions [@problem_id:2258502].
*   **Equatorial positions**: Three positions lie in a single plane (the equatorial plane) around the central atom, separated by [bond angles](@entry_id:136856) of $120^{\circ}$.
*   **Axial positions**: Two positions lie perpendicular to the equatorial plane, one above and one below, with a $180^{\circ}$ angle between them. The angle between an axial position and any equatorial position is $90^{\circ}$.

A critical feature of the [trigonal bipyramidal](@entry_id:141216) geometry is the non-equivalence of its axial and equatorial bonds. In a molecule like $PCl_5$, experimental evidence shows that the two axial P-Cl bonds are slightly longer and weaker than the three equatorial P-Cl bonds. This can be rationalized by analyzing the composition of the [hybrid orbitals](@entry_id:260757) themselves. A more detailed analysis of the [linear combination of atomic orbitals](@entry_id:151829) reveals that the three equatorial hybrid orbitals are formed with significant [s-orbital](@entry_id:151164) contribution, whereas the two axial [hybrid orbitals](@entry_id:260757) have no [s-orbital](@entry_id:151164) character at all [@problem_id:1997912]. Since s-orbitals are closer to the nucleus and lead to stronger, shorter bonds, the equatorial bonds, with their greater s-character (specifically, 33.3% [s-character](@entry_id:148321)), are more robust than the axial bonds (0% s-character).

This inherent energetic difference between the positions also governs the placement of lone pairs. Lone pairs are more diffuse and exert greater repulsive forces than bonding pairs. To minimize overall repulsion, a lone pair will always occupy a position that minimizes its high-repulsion $90^{\circ}$ interactions. In a TBP geometry, an equatorial position has only two such interactions (with the two axial positions). An axial position, however, has three $90^{\circ}$ interactions (with the three equatorial positions). Therefore, lone pairs preferentially occupy equatorial sites [@problem_id:2258524]. This principle correctly predicts the molecular shapes of [hypervalent](@entry_id:188223) species:
*   **$AX_4E_1$** (e.g., $SF_4$): With one lone pair in an equatorial position, the [molecular geometry](@entry_id:137852) is described as a **seesaw**.
*   **$AX_3E_2$** (e.g., $ClF_3$): With two lone pairs in equatorial positions, the [molecular geometry](@entry_id:137852) is **T-shaped**.
*   **$AX_2E_3$** (e.g., $XeF_2$): With three lone pairs occupying all three equatorial sites, the two bonded atoms are forced into the axial positions, resulting in a **linear** molecular geometry.

### Geometries from Six Electron Domains: $sp^3d^2$ Hybridization

For central atoms with six electron domains, the hybridization scheme must expand further to include a second $d$-orbital, resulting in **$sp^3d^2$ hybridization**. These six hybrid orbitals orient themselves towards the vertices of an **octahedron** to minimize electron-electron repulsion. In a perfect [octahedral geometry](@entry_id:143692), all six positions are equivalent, and all adjacent [bond angles](@entry_id:136856) are $90^{\circ}$ [@problem_id:1997895].

This model provides an excellent description for many [hypervalent](@entry_id:188223) compounds, including those of the noble gases. Consider xenon tetrafluoride ($XeF_4$), a compound with a square planar [molecular geometry](@entry_id:137852) [@problem_id:2258529]. To determine its [hybridization](@entry_id:145080), we count the electron domains around the central xenon atom. Xenon, a noble gas, has 8 valence electrons. It forms single bonds with four fluorine atoms, using 4 electrons for bonding. This leaves $8 - 4 = 4$ non-bonding electrons, which constitute 2 [lone pairs](@entry_id:188362). The total number of electron domains is the sum of bonding pairs and [lone pairs](@entry_id:188362): $4 + 2 = 6$.

Six electron domains require $sp^3d^2$ hybridization, corresponding to an octahedral [electron geometry](@entry_id:191006). In this $AX_4E_2$ arrangement, the two repulsive lone pairs position themselves on opposite sides of the central atom (i.e., at a $180^{\circ}$ angle) to achieve maximum separation. This leaves the four fluorine atoms occupying the four positions in the equatorial plane, resulting in the observed **square planar** [molecular geometry](@entry_id:137852). Similarly, a molecule with an $AX_5E_1$ configuration, such as bromine pentafluoride ($BrF_5$), also has an octahedral [electron geometry](@entry_id:191006), but its [molecular geometry](@entry_id:137852) is **square pyramidal**.

### A Deeper Look at d-Orbital Selection

The simple labels $sp^3d$ and $sp^3d^2$ conceal an important subtlety: which of the five available $d$-orbitals ($d_{xy}$, $d_{yz}$, $d_{xz}$, $d_{x^2-y^2}$, $d_{z^2}$) are involved? The selection is not random but is dictated by the geometry of the molecule and the principle of maximizing [orbital overlap](@entry_id:143431). The participating $d$-orbitals must have lobes that are oriented correctly in space to form strong [sigma bonds](@entry_id:273958) with the ligand orbitals.

In a **[trigonal bipyramidal](@entry_id:141216)** ($sp^3d$) geometry, it is conventional to align the axial bonds along the $z$-axis and the equatorial bonds in the $xy$-plane. The three equatorial hybrids are formed from the $s$, $p_x$, and $p_y$ orbitals. To form the two bonds along the $z$-axis, orbitals with significant electron density along this axis are required. The $p_z$ orbital is one such orbital. Of the five $d$-orbitals, only the **$d_{z^2}$** orbital has major lobes pointing directly along the $z$-axis. It is therefore uniquely suited to combine with the $p_z$ orbital to form the two axial [hybrid orbitals](@entry_id:260757) [@problem_id:2258546].

In an **octahedral** ($sp^3d^2$) geometry, the six bonds lie along the $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes. To form six equivalent [sigma bonds](@entry_id:273958) in these directions, the central atom must use orbitals that point along these axes. The $s$ orbital (spherically symmetric) and the $p_x$, $p_y$, and $p_z$ orbitals (which are aligned with the axes) are obvious choices. For the two required $d$-orbitals, we must select those whose lobes also point along the Cartesian axes. The $d_{xy}$, $d_{yz}$, and $d_{xz}$ orbitals have lobes directed *between* the axes and are thus unsuitable for this purpose. In contrast, the **$d_{x^2-y^2}$** orbital has lobes along the $x$ and $y$ axes, and the **$d_{z^2}$** orbital has lobes along the $z$-axis. These two orbitals are therefore precisely the ones required to complete the set for $sp^3d^2$ [hybridization](@entry_id:145080) aimed at octahedral bonding [@problem_id:1997900].

### Modern Perspectives and Limitations of the Model

While the [hybridization](@entry_id:145080) model involving $d$-orbitals is a remarkably successful pedagogical tool for predicting and rationalizing the geometries of [hypervalent molecules](@entry_id:141103), it is crucial to recognize its limitations. Modern quantum chemical calculations have revealed that this model is a significant simplification of the true electronic structure.

The primary objection to the model is energetic [@problem_id:2258542]. For main-group elements like sulfur or phosphorus, the vacant valence $d$-orbitals are substantially higher in energy than the valence $s$ and $p$ orbitals. The energy cost required to "promote" electrons into these high-energy $d$-orbitals to make them available for [hybridization](@entry_id:145080) is prohibitively large and is generally not compensated by the energy released upon forming two additional bonds. Detailed calculations show that the actual participation of $d$-orbitals in the bonding of molecules like $SF_6$ is minimal.

More accurate descriptions, based on Molecular Orbital Theory, explain [hypervalency](@entry_id:142714) without significant $d$-orbital involvement. These models often invoke the concept of delocalized **three-center, four-electron (3c-4e) bonds**, where three atoms are bonded together using a set of molecular orbitals derived from only $p$-orbitals on the central atom and orbitals from two ligands.

In conclusion, the concept of $sp^3d$ and $sp^3d^2$ hybridization should be viewed as a powerful and effective **valence bond model** rather than a literal depiction of electronic reality. It remains an indispensable tool for students of chemistry because its predictions of molecular geometry are overwhelmingly correct. It provides a simple, coherent framework for understanding the structures of a vast number of compounds, bridging the gap between simple Lewis structures and complex molecular shapes.
