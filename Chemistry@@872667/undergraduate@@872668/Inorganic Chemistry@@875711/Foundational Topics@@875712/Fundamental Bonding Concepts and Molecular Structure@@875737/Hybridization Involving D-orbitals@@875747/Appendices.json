The steric number dictates the electron geometry and the corresponding hybridization scheme.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the cation, $[\\text{BrF}_2]^+$.\n1.  The central atom is bromine (Br). A neutral bromine atom is in Group 17, so it has 7 valence electrons.\n2.  The ion has a charge of $+1$, which means we must subtract one electron from the valence count of the central atom. So, the bromine atom in the cation has $7 - 1 = 6$ valence electrons to use for bonding and lone pairs.\n3.  The bromine atom is bonded to two fluorine (F) atoms. Each Br-F bond is a single bond (a sigma bond). This accounts for 2 of the 6 valence electrons.\n4.  The number of non-bonding electrons is the total valence electrons minus the electrons used in bonding: $6 - 2 = 4$ non-bonding electrons.\n5.  These non-bonding electrons form lone pairs. Since each lone pair consists of 2 electrons, we have $4 / 2 = 2$ lone pairs on the central bromine atom.\n6.  The steric number is the sum of sigma bonds and lone pairs: Steric Number = 2 (sigma bonds) + 2 (lone pairs) = 4.\n7.  A steric number of 4 corresponds to an $sp^3$ hybridization. The electron geometry is tetrahedral, and with two bonding pairs and two lone pairs, the molecular geometry is bent.\n\nNext, let's analyze the anion, $[\\text{BrF}_4]^-$.\n1.  The central atom is again bromine (Br), with 7 valence electrons in its neutral state.\n2.  The ion has a charge of $-1$, which means we must add one electron to the valence count of the central atom. So, the bromine atom in the anion has $7 + 1 = 8$ valence electrons.\n3.  The bromine atom is bonded to four fluorine (F) atoms. Each Br-F bond is a single bond. This accounts for 4 of the 8 valence electrons.\n4.  The number of non-bonding electrons is $8 - 4 = 4$ non-bonding electrons.\n5.  These non-bonding electrons form $4 / 2 = 2$ lone pairs on the central bromine atom.\n6.  The steric number is the sum of sigma bonds and lone pairs: Steric Number = 4 (sigma bonds) + 2 (lone pairs) = 6.\n7.  A steric number of 6 corresponds to a $d^2sp^3$ hybridization (or $sp^3d^2$). This hybridization involves one s-orbital, three p-orbitals, and two d-orbitals. The electron geometry is octahedral, and with four bonding pairs and two lone pairs, the molecular geometry is square planar (the lone pairs occupy trans positions to minimize repulsion).\n\nCombining our findings, the hybridization of the bromine atom in the cation $[\\text{BrF}_2]^+$ is $sp^3$, and in the anion $[\\text{BrF}_4]^-$ is $d^2sp^3$.
