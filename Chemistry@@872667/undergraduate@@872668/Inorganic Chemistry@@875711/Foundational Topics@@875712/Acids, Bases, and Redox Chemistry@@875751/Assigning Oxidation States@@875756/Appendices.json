Its chemical formula is $V(O)(C_5H_7O_2)_2$. In this formula, 'O' represents an oxo ligand, which can be formally considered to have an oxidation state of -2. The ligand represented by $C_5H_7O_2$ is acetylacetonate, an anion formed via the deprotonation of a single acidic proton from its neutral parent molecule, acetylacetone ($C_5H_8O_2$).

The complex $V(O)(C_{5}H_{7}O_{2})_{2}$ is electrically neutral, so the sum of oxidation states must be zero.\n\nRelevant charges:\n- The oxo ligand $O^{2-}$ has a charge of $-2$.\n- Each acetylacetonate ligand $(C_{5}H_{7}O_{2})^{-}$ has a charge of $-1$, and there are two of them, contributing $2 \\times (-1) = -2$.\n\nCharge balance gives:\n$$x + (-2) + 2 \\times (-1) = 0$$\n$$x - 2 - 2 = 0$$\n$$x - 4 = 0$$\n$$x = 4$$\n\nThus, the vanadium is in the $+4$ oxidation state, corresponding to option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2234042"}, {"introduction": "While the sum of charges is a powerful tool, the formalism of oxidation states must also account for specific structural features within a molecule. This practice problem introduces the important exception for bonds between identical atoms, where bonding electrons are considered to be shared equally. Solving this requires you to integrate given structural information—the presence of a direct phosphorus-phosphorus bond—into your calculation, illustrating a deeper level of analysis [@problem_id:2234049].", "problem": "In the synthesis of certain flame-retardant polymers, salts of hypodiphosphoric acid are sometimes used as precursors. To predict the redox behavior of this precursor, it is necessary to determine the oxidation states of its constituent atoms. Structural studies, such as X-ray crystallography, have revealed that the hypodiphosphate anion, $[P_2O_6]^{4-}$, possesses a symmetric structure containing a direct, single covalent bond between the two phosphorus atoms. Given this structural information, determine the formal oxidation state of a single phosphorus atom within the hypodiphosphate anion.", "solution": "We are asked for the formal oxidation state of a single phosphorus atom in the symmetric anion $[P_{2}O_{6}]^{4-}$, which contains a direct single $P\\text{–}P$ bond. By the standard oxidation state rules:\n- Oxygen in oxides has oxidation state $-2$.\n- A bond between identical atoms (here, the $P\\text{–}P$ bond) contributes zero to oxidation states because the bonding electrons are divided equally; hence it does not affect the oxidation state of either phosphorus.\n\nLet the oxidation state of each phosphorus be $x$. The sum of oxidation states equals the net charge of the ion.

In $[RuCl(NO)_2(PPh_3)_2]^+$, both nitrosyl ligands are coordinated to the ruthenium center in a linear fashion (i.e., the Ru-N-O angle is approximately 180°). In contrast, the single nitrosyl ligand in $RuCl_3(NO)(PPh_3)_2$ is coordinated in a bent fashion (i.e., the Ru-N-O angle is significantly less than 180°).\n\nBased on the standard covalent bond classification method for assigning oxidation states, determine the formal integer oxidation state of the ruthenium center in both complexes.
