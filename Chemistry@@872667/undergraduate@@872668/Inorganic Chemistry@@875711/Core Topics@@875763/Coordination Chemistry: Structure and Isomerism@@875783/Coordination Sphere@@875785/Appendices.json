This rule proposes that stable complexes often have a total of 18 valence electrons associated with the central metal atom. In this problem, you will apply this rule to determine the necessary charge on a complex to achieve this stable electronic configuration, shifting from simple charge accounting to predictive electron counting [@problem_id:2241932].", "problem": "In organometallic chemistry, the 18-electron rule serves as a useful heuristic for predicting the stability of transition metal complexes. This rule states that thermodynamically stable complexes often have a total of 18 electrons in the valence shell of the central metal atom, which includes the metal's own valence electrons plus the electrons donated by the coordinating ligands.\n\nConsider two hypothetical metal carbonyl species, A and B, that are being investigated as potential intermediates in a novel chemical synthesis. Species A has the chemical formula $[Fe(CO)_4]^x$, and species B has the chemical formula $[V(CO)_6]^y$.\n\nFor the purposes of your calculation, use the neutral ligand model where each carbonyl (CO) ligand is considered a neutral, 2-electron donor. The central metal atom for species A is Iron (Fe), a group 8 element. The central metal atom for species B is Vanadium (V), a group 5 element.\n\nTo satisfy the 18-electron rule, each complex must possess a specific integer charge, denoted by $x$ for species A and $y$ for species B. Determine the values of $x$ and $y$ that allow each complex to obey the 18-electron rule, and then calculate the sum of these charges, $x+y$.", "solution": "The 18-electron rule requires the total valence electron count at the metal center to be $18$. In the neutral (covalent) ligand model, each CO donates $2$ electrons, and the metal contributes its group number as valence electrons. An overall positive charge $q$ removes $q$ electrons from the total, while a negative charge adds $|q|$ electrons. Thus, for a complex with charge $q$, the total valence electron count is given by\n$$E=\\text{(metal group number)}+\\sum \\text{(ligand donations)}-q.$$\n\nFor species A, $[Fe(CO)_4]^{x}$ with Fe a group $8$ metal and $4$ CO ligands:\n$$E_{A}=8+4\\times 2 - x=18 \\implies 16 - x=18 \\implies x=-2.$$\n\nFor species B, $[V(CO)_6]^{y}$ with V a group $5$ metal and $6$ CO ligands:\n$$E_{B}=5+6\\times 2 - y=18 \\implies 17 - y=18 \\implies y=-1.$$\n\nTherefore, the required charges are $x=-2$ and $y=-1$, and their sum is\n$$x+y=-2+(-1)=-3.$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-3}$$", "id": "2241932"}, {"introduction": "The three-dimensional arrangement of ligands around a central metal ion—the coordination geometry—is not arbitrary. It results from a delicate balance between electronic stabilization and steric repulsion. This practice challenges you to analyze a classic chemical transformation and deduce the primary reason for a change in geometry, forcing you to weigh the impact of ligand size against electronic effects to explain an observed outcome [@problem_id:2241984].", "problem": "The characteristic pink color of aqueous cobalt(II) solutions is due to the presence of the hexaaquacobalt(II) ion, $[Co(H_2O)_6]^{2+}$. Upon addition of a concentrated solution of chloride ions, a striking color change to deep blue is observed, indicating the formation of the tetrachloridocobaltate(II) ion, $[CoCl_4]^{2-}$. This transformation involves a change in both the coordination number and the geometry of the complex.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the primary reason for the observed change from the octahedral geometry of $[Co(H_2O)_6]^{2+}$ to the tetrahedral geometry of $[CoCl_4]^{2-}$?\n\nA. The cobalt center is oxidized from Co(II) to Co(III), and the resulting d-electron count favors a tetrahedral arrangement.\nB. The chloride ligand is a much stronger-field ligand than the water ligand, which forces a spin-state change that is only stable in a tetrahedral geometry.\nC. The overall charge of the complex changes from cationic ($+2$) to anionic ($-2$), and anionic complexes inherently favor a tetrahedral geometry over an octahedral one.\nD. The chloride ligands are significantly larger than the water ligands, leading to substantial steric repulsion that favors the lower coordination number and more open arrangement of a tetrahedral geometry.\nE. The reaction is driven by the release of six water molecules, an entropically favorable process that is maximized when the resulting complex has the lowest possible coordination number, which is four.", "solution": "The cobalt center remains in the +2 oxidation state throughout, so option A is invalid. The spectrochemical series places chloride as a weaker-field ligand than water, so option B is incorrect; moreover, tetrahedral fields are intrinsically weaker, and there is no forced spin-state change unique to tetrahedral geometry here. Anionic charge does not inherently impose tetrahedral geometry, as many anionic complexes are octahedral (e.g., hexacyanoferrate), so option C is not a primary reason. Releasing water increases entropy, but entropy alone does not mandate a four-coordinate product nor does it specifically select tetrahedral geometry; thus option E misattributes the driving force.\n\nTo formalize the ligand field argument, consider Co(II) as $d^7$. In an octahedral weak field (appropriate for $H_{2}O$), the high-spin configuration is $t_{2g}^5e_g^2$, giving\n$$\n\\text{CFSE}_{\\text{oct}} = 5\\left(-\\frac{2}{5}\\Delta_{o}\\right) + 2\\left(+\\frac{3}{5}\\Delta_{o}\\right) = -\\frac{4}{5}\\Delta_{o},\n$$\nwith two pairing energies. In a tetrahedral field (appropriate for $Cl^{-}$), the high-spin configuration is $e^4t_2^3$, giving\n$$\n\\text{CFSE}_{\\text{tet}} = 4\\left(-\\frac{3}{5}\\Delta_{t}\\right) + 3\\left(+\\frac{2}{5}\\Delta_{t}\\right) = -\\frac{6}{5}\\Delta_{t},\n$$\nalso with two pairing energies. Using the standard relation $\\Delta_{t} \\approx \\frac{4}{9}\\Delta_{o}$ for the same metal-ligand pair and noting that $Cl^{-}$ is a weaker-field ligand than $H_{2}O$, one finds that the ligand-field stabilization does not favor tetrahedral over octahedral; if anything, octahedral with $H_{2}O$ has the larger magnitude CFSE. Therefore, the primary factor causing the shift from octahedral $[Co(H_{2}O)_{6}]^{2+}$ to tetrahedral $[CoCl_{4}]^{2-}$ is not increased field strength or LFSE, nor the complex charge or entropy alone.\n\nThe decisive factor is sterics: chloride ligands are significantly larger than water molecules. Increased ligand-ligand repulsion for six bulky chloride ligands disfavors octahedral coordination, and a lower coordination number with a more open arrangement (tetrahedral, four-coordinate) minimizes steric crowding. This well-known steric effect explains why $d^7$ Co(II) commonly forms tetrahedral complexes with halides, while it forms octahedral complexes with smaller ligands such as water.\n\nHence, the primary reason is the larger size of chloride leading to steric repulsion that favors tetrahedral geometry, which corresponds to option D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2241984"}]}
