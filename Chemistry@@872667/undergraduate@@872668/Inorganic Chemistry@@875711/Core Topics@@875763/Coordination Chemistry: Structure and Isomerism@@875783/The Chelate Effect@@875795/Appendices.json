A key factor influencing stability is the chelate effect, which describes the enhanced stability of complexes containing polydentate ligands compared to those with analogous monodentate ligands.\n\nConsider the complex ion diaquabis(oxalato)chromate(III), which has the chemical formula $[Cr(ox)_2(H_2O)_2]^-$. In this complex, the central metal ion is chromium (Cr). It is coordinated by two types of ligands: the oxalate ligand, represented by 'ox' (chemical formula $C_2O_4^{2-}$), and the aqua ligand ($H_2O$).\n\nIt is known that the oxalate ligand is bidentate, meaning it binds to the central metal ion through two donor atoms. The aqua ligand is monodentate, binding through a single donor atom.\n\nDetermine the coordination number of the central chromium ion and the total number of chelate rings present in this complex.

The oxalate ligand is bidentate (denticity $2$) and binds through two oxygen donors; water is monodentate (denticity $1$).\nThus, with two oxalate ligands and two water ligands,\n$$\\text{Coordination number} = 2 \\times 2 + 2 \\times 1 = 6.$$\n\nA chelate ring is formed when a polydentate ligand binds through two or more donor atoms to the same metal, creating a ring that includes the metal.

The key principle governing this choice is the chelate effect.\n\n1.  **Identify the initial state and potential final states.**\n    The initial nickel(II) species in aqueous solution is the hexaaquanickel(II) ion, [Ni(H₂O)₆]²⁺. The problem provides enough of each ligand to form either the hexaammine complex or the tris(ethylenediamine) complex. The competing overall reactions are:\n\n    **Reaction A (with ammonia):**\n    $$[Ni(H_2O)_6]^{2+}(aq) + 6 NH_3(aq) \\rightleftharpoons [Ni(NH_3)_6]^{2+}(aq) + 6 H_2O(l)$$\n\n    **Reaction B (with ethylenediamine):**\n    $$[Ni(H_2O)_6]^{2+}(aq) + 3 \\text{ en}(aq) \\rightleftharpoons [Ni(\\text{en})_3]^{2+}(aq) + 6 H_2O(l)$$\n\n2.  **Analyze the thermodynamics of the reactions.**\n    The thermodynamically preferred product is the one with the more negative Gibbs free energy of formation (ΔG°). The relationship is given by ΔG° = ΔH° - TΔS°. We must compare ΔG° for Reaction A and Reaction B.\n\n3.  **Compare the enthalpy changes (ΔH°).**\n    In both reactions, six coordinate bonds between nickel and oxygen atoms (Ni-O) in the aqua complex are broken, and six coordinate bonds between nickel and nitrogen atoms (Ni-N) are formed. Since both ammonia and ethylenediamine are neutral ligands that coordinate through nitrogen atoms, the strength of the Ni-N bonds formed should be comparable. Therefore, the net enthalpy change (ΔH°) for both reactions is expected to be similar. We cannot confidently predict the favored product based on enthalpy alone.\n\n4.  **Compare the entropy changes (ΔS°).**\n    Entropy (ΔS°) is related to the change in the number of independent particles (disorder) in the system. Let's count the number of free-moving solute species on each side of the equilibria.\n\n    *   **For Reaction A:**\n        Reactants: 1 particle ([Ni(H₂O)₆]²⁺) + 6 particles (NH₃) = 7 particles\n        Products: 1 particle ([Ni(NH₃)₆]²⁺)\n        (We typically ignore the solvent, water, in this particle-counting approximation for solution reactions, or note that it's a net exchange). A more precise count considers the displaced water molecules as products.\n        Reactants (solutes): 7 particles. Products (solutes + displaced solvent not in bulk): 1 complex ion + 6 water molecules = 7 particles.\n        The change in the number of independent particles is approximately zero (Δn ≈ 7 - 7 = 0). Thus, the entropy change (ΔS°) for this reaction is expected to be small.\n\n    *   **For Reaction B:**\n        Reactants: 1 particle ([Ni(H₂O)₆]²⁺) + 3 particles (en) = 4 particles\n        Products: 1 particle ([Ni(en)₃]²⁺)\n        Considering the displaced water:\n        Reactants (solutes): 4 particles. Products (solutes + displaced solvent): 1 complex ion + 6 water molecules = 7 particles.\n        The change in the number of independent particles is significantly positive (Δn ≈ 7 - 4 = +3). This represents a substantial increase in the disorder of the system. Therefore, the entropy change (ΔS°) for this reaction is large and positive.\n\n5.  **Combine enthalpy and entropy to determine Gibbs free energy.**\n    *   ΔG°(Reaction A) = ΔH°(A) - TΔS°(A)\n    *   ΔG°(Reaction B) = ΔH°(B) - TΔS°(B)\n\n    We established that ΔH°(A) ≈ ΔH°(B) and, crucially, ΔS°(B) >> ΔS°(A) (since ΔS°(B) is large and positive, while ΔS°(A) is near zero).\n    The large, positive ΔS° for Reaction B makes the -TΔS° term large and negative. This results in a significantly more negative ΔG° for the formation of the ethylenediamine complex compared to the ammonia complex.\n    $$ \\Delta G^\\circ(\\text{Reaction B}) \\ll \\Delta G^\\circ(\\text{Reaction A}) $$\n\n6.  **Conclusion.**\n    The formation of the chelate complex, [Ni(en)₃]²⁺, is far more thermodynamically favorable than the formation of the monodentate complex, [Ni(NH₃)₆]²⁺. This enhanced stability of complexes formed by polydentate ligands is known as the chelate effect. Consequently, at equilibrium, the predominant species in solution will be [Ni(en)₃]²⁺. The other options are incorrect: [Ni(NH₃)₆]²⁺ is less stable; [Ni(NH₃)₄(en)]²⁺ is a mixed-ligand complex that might form as an intermediate but won't be the final, most stable product; an equal mixture implies no thermodynamic preference; and [Ni(H₂O)₆]²⁺ would remain only if no reaction was favorable, which is not the case.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2294198"}, {"introduction": "We have explained the chelate effect qualitatively by looking at the increase in the number of particles, which leads to a positive entropy change.
