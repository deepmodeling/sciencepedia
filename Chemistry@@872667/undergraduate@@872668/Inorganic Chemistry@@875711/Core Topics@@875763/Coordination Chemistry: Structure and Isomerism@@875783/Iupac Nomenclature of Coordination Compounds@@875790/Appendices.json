Since there are two of them, the prefix \"di-\" is used, giving \"dichloro\".\nThe name for the PPh₃ ligand is \"triphenylphosphine\". Because this ligand name itself contains a numerical prefix (\"tri-\"), we must use the special prefixes for multiple complex ligands: bis- for two, tris- for three, tetrakis- for four, etc. Since there are two triphenylphosphine ligands, the name is \"bis(triphenylphosphine)\". The ligand name is placed in parentheses.\n\nStep 4: Order the ligands alphabetically.\nThe ligands are listed alphabetically according to their names, ignoring the numerical prefixes (di-, tri-, bis-, tris-, etc.).\nWe compare \"chlorido\" and \"triphenylphosphine\".\n'c' in chlorido comes before 't' in triphenylphosphine.\nTherefore, the ligand part of the name is \"dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)\".\n\nStep 5: Name the central metal.\nThe name of the central metal depends on the charge of the complex.\n- If the complex is anionic (has a negative charge), the metal's name ends in \"-ate\" (e.g., zincate, ferrate, cuprate).\n- If the complex is neutral or cationic (has a positive charge), the metal's element name is used as is.\nIn this case, the complex is neutral, so the metal is named \"zinc\".\n\nStep 6: Assemble the full name.\nThe full name is assembled in the following order: (ligand names in alphabetical order) + (metal name) + (oxidation state in parentheses).\nCombining the parts from the previous steps:\ndichlorobis(triphenylphosphine) + zinc + (II)\nThe correct name is: dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)zinc(II).\n\nStep 7: Compare with the given options.\nA. bis(triphenylphosphine)dichlorozinc(II) - Incorrect alphabetical order of ligands.\nB. dichloroditriphenylphosphinezinc(II) - Incorrect prefix for triphenylphosphine; \"di-\" is used instead of \"bis-\".\nC. dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)zinc(II) - This matches our derived name.\nD. dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)zincate(II) - Incorrect metal suffix; \"-ate\" is for anionic complexes, but this complex is neutral.\nE. dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)zinc(0) - Incorrect oxidation state for zinc.\n\nThus, the correct option is C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2263238"}, {"introduction": "Nomenclature is not just about labeling; it's a precise language that can distinguish between isomers—compounds with the same formula but different structures.

First, we must deduce the chemical formula from the given name, and second, we must determine the name of a described ionization isomer.\n\n**Part 1: Deducing the chemical formula for `pentaamminechloridocobalt(III) sulfate`**\n\n1.  **Identify Components:** The name can be broken down into the cation (the coordination complex) and the anion (the counter-ion).\n    *   Cation: `pentaamminechloridocobalt(III)`\n    *   Anion: `sulfate`\n\n2.  **Analyze the Cation (Coordination Complex):**\n    *   **Central Metal:** `cobalt` indicates the central metal is Co. The Roman numeral `(III)` specifies its oxidation state is $+3$.\n    *   **Ligands:** The ligands are listed before the metal.\n        *   `pentaammine`: This indicates five (`penta-`) ammine ligands. The ammine ligand is neutral ammonia, $NH_3$. Total charge from these ligands is $5 \\times 0 = 0$.\n        *   `chlorido`: This indicates one chloride ligand, $Cl^-$.

By convention, ligands are often written with anionic ligands before neutral ones inside the brackets, but placing them alphabetically is also common. Let's stick to the common textbook representation placing neutral ligands first when their formula is simpler.

Therefore, the metal name remains `cobalt`. If the complex were anionic, the suffix `-ate` would be added (e.g., `cobaltate`).\n    *   **Specify Oxidation State:** The oxidation state of cobalt is `(III)`. This is written in Roman numerals in parentheses after the metal name.\n    *   **Combine Cation Name:** `pentaamminesulfatocobalt(III)`\n    *   **Name the Counter-ion:** The counter-ion is $Cl^-$, which is named `chloride`.
