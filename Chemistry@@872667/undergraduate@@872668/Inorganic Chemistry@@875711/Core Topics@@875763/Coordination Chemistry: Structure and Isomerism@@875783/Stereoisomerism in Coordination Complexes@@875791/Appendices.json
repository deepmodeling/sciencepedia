The chemical formula of the complex ion is $[\\text{IrCl}_2(\\text{ox})_2]^{3-}$, where 'ox' represents the bidentate oxalate ligand, $C_2O_4^{2-}$. Stereoisomers are isomers that have the same molecular formula and connectivity of atoms but differ in the three-dimensional arrangement of their atoms in space.\n\nYour task is to analyze the possible stereoisomers for this complex. Determine the total number of unique stereoisomers that can exist for $[\\text{IrCl}_2(\\text{ox})_2]^{3-}$. Then, determine how many of these unique stereoisomers are chiral, meaning they are non-superimposable on their mirror images.\n\nProvide your answer as two integers: the first integer representing the total number of stereoisomers, and the second integer representing the number of chiral stereoisomers.", "solution": "We identify the coordination environment as octahedral around Ir(III) with a ligand set consisting of two identical monodentate chlorides ($\\text{Cl}^{-}$) and two identical symmetric bidentate oxalates ($\\text{ox}^{2-}$). Such a complex can be classified as $\\text{M(AA)}_{2}\\text{X}_{2}$, where AA is a symmetric bidentate ligand and X is a monodentate ligand.\n\nStep 1: Enumerate possible geometrical isomers.\nIn an octahedral complex with two identical monodentate ligands, there are two distinct relative arrangements for the $X_{2}$ fragment:\n- Trans: the two $X$ ligands occupy opposite coordination sites.\n- Cis: the two $X$ ligands occupy adjacent coordination sites.\nSince the two bidentate oxalate ligands are identical and symmetric, there are no additional distinct geometrical arrangements beyond cis and trans for $[\\text{M(ox)}_{2}\\text{X}_{2}]$.\n\nTherefore, there are exactly two geometrical isomers: *cis* and *trans*.\n\nStep 2: Determine optical activity of each geometrical isomer.\n- *trans*-$[\\text{M(ox)}_{2}\\text{X}_{2}]$: Place the two $X$ ligands opposite each other. The remaining four equatorial positions are occupied by the two oxalate chelates, each binding to adjacent positions in the equatorial plane. In this arrangement, there exists a center of inversion at the metal center: each donor atom is mapped to an identical donor atom in the position opposite through the metal, and the two $X$ ligands map onto each other. The presence of an inversion center renders the *trans* isomer achiral. Hence, the *trans* isomer is a single, achiral stereoisomer.\n- *cis*-$[\\text{M(ox)}_{2}\\text{X}_{2}]$: With the two $X$ ligands adjacent, the complex lacks any plane of symmetry or center of inversion. For symmetric bidentate chelates such as oxalate, the *cis*-$\\text{M(AA)}_{2}\\text{X}_{2}$ geometry is chiral and occurs as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images characterized by opposite helicities, commonly denoted $\\Delta$ and $\\Lambda$. Therefore, the *cis* isomer gives two enantiomers, both chiral.\n\nStep 3: Count unique stereoisomers and chiral ones.\n- Unique stereoisomers: one *trans* (achiral) plus two enantiomers of *cis*, totaling $3$.\n- Chiral stereoisomers: the two *cis* enantiomers, totaling $2$.\n\nThus, the total number of stereoisomers is $3$, of which $2$ are chiral.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\begin{pmatrix}3 & 2\\end{pmatrix}}$$", "id": "2289891"}, {"introduction": "A common pitfall is to overgeneralize from a specific example, such as assuming that all *cis* isomers are chiral. This exercise presents a thought experiment with a simpler $[\\text{MA}_4\\text{B}_2]$ complex, containing only monodentate ligands, to test that very assumption. By analyzing its symmetry, you will discover the crucial conditions required for chirality and appreciate why the chelate rings in the previous example ([@problem_id:2289891]) were so important ([@problem_id:2289870]).", "problem": "In coordination chemistry, the spatial arrangement of ligands around a central metal ion gives rise to various forms of isomerism. One important class is stereoisomerism, which includes optical isomerism (enantiomers). A molecule is considered chiral, and thus can have an enantiomer, if its mirror image is non-superimposable upon the original. Operationally, a molecule is achiral if it possesses any improper axis of rotation ($S_n$), which includes a plane of symmetry ($\\sigma$, equivalent to $S_1$) or a center of inversion ($i$, equivalent to $S_2$).\n\nConsider a generic octahedral complex with the formula $[\\text{MA}_4\\text{B}_2]$, where *M* is a central metal ion and *A* and *B* are two different monodentate ligands.

A molecule is achiral if it possesses any improper rotation axis $S_{n}$, which includes a plane of symmetry $\\sigma$ or a center of inversion $i$.\n\nConsider the *cis* isomer of $[\\text{MA}_4\\text{B}_2]$ in an ideal octahedral coordination. Place the metal $M$ at the origin and choose Cartesian axes so that the six coordination directions are along the coordinate axes. Assign the two adjacent $B$ ligands to positions along $+x$ and $+z$, and assign the four $A$ ligands to the remaining directions. Specifically, take\n$$\n\\text{B}_{1}:(a,0,0),\\quad \\text{B}_{2}:(0,0,a),\\quad \\text{A}_{1}:(-a,0,0),\\quad \\text{A}_{2}:(0,0,-a),\\quad \\text{A}_{3}:(0,a,0),\\quad \\text{A}_{4}:(0,-a,0),\n$$\nwith $a>0$.\n\nExhibit a plane of symmetry. Consider the mirror plane $\\sigma_{xz}$ given by $y=0$. The reflection $\\sigma_{xz}$ acts as $(x,y,z)\\mapsto (x,-y,z)$. Applying $\\sigma_{xz}$:\n- $\\text{B}_{1}$ and $\\text{B}_{2}$, as well as $\\text{A}_{1}$ and $\\text{A}_{2}$, lie in the plane (they have $y=0$) and are unchanged.\n- $\\text{A}_{3}$ at $(0,a,0)$ and $\\text{A}_{4}$ at $(0,-a,0)$ are interchanged; since both are $A$, this interchange yields an indistinguishable configuration.\n\nThus $\\sigma_{xz}$ is a symmetry element.\n\nA second mirror plane also exists: the plane $\\sigma_{d}$ defined by $x=z$, with reflection $(x,y,z)\\mapsto (z,y,x)$. Under this reflection:\n- $\\text{B}_{1}:(a,0,0)\\mapsto (0,0,a)=\\text{B}_{2}$ and $\\text{B}_{2}:(0,0,a)\\mapsto (a,0,0)=\\text{B}_{1}$.\n- $\\text{A}_{1}:(-a,0,0)\\mapsto (0,0,-a)=\\text{A}_{2}$ and $\\text{A}_{2}:(0,0,-a)\\mapsto (-a,0,0)=\\text{A}_{1}$.\n- $\\text{A}_{3}$ and $\\text{A}_{4}$ lie on the plane ($x=z=0$) and remain unchanged.\n\nTherefore the *cis* isomer has at least one (indeed two) mirror planes and belongs to a nonchiral point group (commonly $C_{2v}$). Since the presence of any $\\sigma$ implies an improper rotation axis $S_{1}$, the complex is achiral. Consequently:\n- A is false: lacking an inversion center is not sufficient for chirality.\n- B is false: the complex does have mirror plane(s).\n- D is false: the *cis* isomer does not have a center of inversion.\n- E is not the correct general statement for this geometry; in the standard generic treatment (achiral monodentate ligands), the *cis*-$[\\text{MA}_4\\text{B}_2]$ is achiral due to its mirror plane(s).\n\nHence the correct choice is that the *cis* isomer is never chiral because it possesses a plane of symmetry.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2289870"}, {"introduction": "Now we will apply these principles to a more complex system that features three different types of ligands.

The ligands are ethylenediamine (en), which is a symmetric bidentate ligand, and pyridine (py) and chloride (Cl), which are both monodentate ligands.\n\nDetermine the total number of stereoisomers possible for this complex ion.", "solution": "We analyze the stereochemistry of the octahedral complex ion $[\\text{Rh(en)(py)}_2\\text{Cl}_2]^{+}$, where ethylenediamine (en) is a symmetric bidentate ligand and pyridine (py) and chloride (Cl) are monodentate ligands.\n\n1) Fundamental geometric constraint: In an octahedral complex, a bidentate ligand such as en must bind to two adjacent (*cis*) coordination sites; it cannot span *trans* positions. Therefore, en occupies two *cis* sites, leaving four remaining sites to be occupied by two py and two Cl ligands.\n\n2) Fixing a reference frame: Place en on two adjacent positions. The four remaining sites can be viewed as consisting of one *trans* pair and one *cis* pair relative to each other. Concretely, after fixing en on two adjacent positions, among the remaining four positions there is exactly one *trans* pair; the other two are *cis* to each other. Hence, distributing two identical py and two identical Cl over these four positions leads to the following distinct geometric patterns:\n- Case A (py *trans*): The two py occupy the unique *trans* pair; the two Cl necessarily occupy the two remaining *cis* positions.\n- Case B (Cl *trans*): The two Cl occupy the unique *trans* pair; the two py occupy the two remaining *cis* positions.\n- Case C (all-*cis*): Neither pair occupies the *trans* pair; both the py ligands are mutually *cis* and both the Cl ligands are mutually *cis* (each pair split between one position of the *trans* pair and one of the *cis* positions), yielding no *trans* relationship for either pair.\n\nThese three are not interconvertible by proper rotations and hence constitute three distinct geometrical isomers.\n\n3) Optical activity analysis:\n- In Case A (py *trans*) and Case B (Cl *trans*), the arrangement possesses a mirror plane that bisects the chelate edge and exchanges the two identical ligands in the *cis* equatorial positions while leaving the *trans* pair invariant. Because a mirror plane is an improper symmetry element, each of these isomers is achiral and corresponds to a single stereoisomer.\n- In Case C (all-*cis*), the arrangement lacks any improper symmetry element (no mirror plane, no inversion center, no improper rotation), so it is chiral and occurs as a pair of non-superposable mirror images (enantiomers). Therefore, Case C contributes two stereoisomers.\n\n4) Counting stereoisomers: The total number is the sum of achiral geometrical isomers (one each from Cases A and B) plus the enantiomeric pair from Case C, giving $1+1+2=4$ stereoisomers in total.\n\nTherefore, the complex $[\\text{Rh(en)(py)}_2\\text{Cl}_2]^{+}$ has $4$ stereoisomers.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "2289857"}]}
