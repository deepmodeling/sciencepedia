Such a complex is of the general type $M(AA)_3$, with $AA$ a symmetric bidentate ligand.\n\nFirst, geometric isomerism of the *fac*/*mer* type (option A) applies to $MA_3B_3$ systems with monodentate ligands, distinguishing arrangements where three identical ligands occupy one face (*fac*) or a meridian (*mer*). In a tris-bidentate complex $M(AA)_3$, there are no three separate identical monodentate positions to define *fac* versus *mer*; the chelate rings fix pairs of donor atoms and eliminate this possibility. Therefore *fac*/*mer* isomerism does not occur.\n\nSecond, *cis*/*trans* geometric isomerism (option B) is characteristic of $MA_4B_2$ or $MA_2B_2$-type octahedral complexes with monodentate ligands or certain mixed chelate/mono arrangements. In $M(AA)_3$, each bidentate ligand occupies adjacent positions forming a five-membered chelate ring; there is no alternative arrangement of identical chelates that yields distinct *cis* versus *trans* dispositions without breaking chelate rings. Hence *cis*/*trans* isomerism does not occur.\n\nThird, linkage isomerism (option E) requires an ambidentate ligand that can coordinate through different donor atoms (e.g., $\\text{NO}_2^-$ via N or O). Oxalate $\\text{C}_2\\text{O}_4^{2-}$ in this complex coordinates as a chelating dianion through two equivalent oxygen donors; there is no alternative heteroatom donor set within the ligand that would produce linkage isomers. Thus linkage isomerism does not occur.\n\nFourth, despite all ligands being identical, $M(AA)_3$ octahedral complexes are generally chiral because the three chelate rings can adopt a helical arrangement of either right-handed (Δ) or left-handed (Λ) twist. The complex lacks a center of inversion, a mirror plane, and an improper rotation axis that would relate these forms, so it exists as a pair of non-superimposable mirror images (enantiomers). Therefore option C is correct, and option D is false.\n\nHence, $[\\text{Fe}(\\text{C}_2\\text{O}_4)_3]^{3-}$ exhibits optical isomerism and exists as Δ and Λ enantiomers.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "2275451"}, {"introduction": "While chelate rings often lead to chiral structures, it's a common misconception that they are a necessary condition for chirality.

There is a vertical mirror plane containing the $z$-axis and bisecting the angle between $x$ and $y$ that exchanges the two NH$_3$ and separately the two H$_2$O positions while leaving Br fixed, so a mirror plane exists.

The isomer in which the two nitrogen atoms of the ethylenediamine ligand are positioned *trans* to one another.\n\nC. The isomer in which a chloride ligand is *trans* to another chloride ligand, and a nitrogen atom from ethylenediamine is *trans* to an oxygen atom from oxalate.\n\nD. The isomer in which the two chloride ligands are positioned *cis* to one another.", "solution": "First, confirm the formulation and oxidation state: in $[\\text{Cr}(\\text{en})(\\text{ox})\\text{Cl}_2]^-$, ethylenediamine (*en*) is neutral, oxalate (*ox*) is $\\text{C}_2\\text{O}_4^{2-}$, and each chloride is $\\text{Cl}^-$. With $\\text{Cr}^{3+}$, the total ligand charge is $(-2)+(-1)+(-1)=-4$, giving the overall complex charge $+3+(-4)=-1$, consistent with the formula. In an octahedral complex, each bidentate chelate (*en*, *ox*) binds in a *cis* fashion (two adjacent sites), so any description that places the two donor atoms of *en* or *ox* *trans* is geometrically impossible.\n\nChirality in an octahedral complex arises when the molecule lacks all improper symmetry elements (no mirror planes, no inversion center, no $S_{n}$ axes). Evaluate each option by considering the symmetry consequences of the described arrangement.\n\nOption A places the two chloride ligands *trans*. If the two $\\text{Cl}^-$ occupy opposite positions (e.g., along the $z$ axis), both chelates occupy the equatorial plane. In this idealized arrangement there is at least a horizontal mirror plane through the metal perpendicular to the $\\text{Cl}-\\text{Cr}-\\text{Cl}$ axis that leaves the equatorial donors in place and swaps the two chlorides. The presence of this mirror plane renders the *trans* isomer achiral.\n\nOption B states that the two nitrogen atoms of ethylenediamine are *trans*. This is not a valid geometric isomer because *en* is a bidentate chelating ligand; its two donor nitrogens must bind *cis*. Therefore this option cannot correspond to any isomer, chiral or otherwise.\n\nOption C again asserts that a chloride is *trans* to another chloride, and that an *en* nitrogen is *trans* to an *ox* oxygen. The first clause already imposes the *trans*-$\\text{Cl}_2$ arrangement of Option A, which, as argued, has at least one mirror plane and is therefore achiral. The additional *trans* relationships specified are consistent with such a *trans* arrangement and do not remove the mirror plane, so this isomer is achiral.\n\nOption D places the two chloride ligands *cis*. With *en* and *ox* both chelating and the two identical $\\text{Cl}^-$ adjacent, any plane containing the two chlorides and the metal would interchange the *en* and *ox* chelates if it were a symmetry element, but since *en* and *ox* are different ligands, no such mirror plane exists. There is no inversion center because opposite sites are occupied by different donors, and no horizontal mirror plane is possible because one chloride is not mirrored to another opposite chloride. The remaining possible symmetry is at most a proper rotation (e.g., a $C_2$), which does not preclude chirality. Hence the *cis*-$\\text{Cl}_2$ isomer lacks improper symmetry and is chiral, existing as a pair of enantiomers.\n\nTherefore, the geometric isomer expected to be chiral is the one with the two chloride ligands *cis* to one another.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2275440"}]}
