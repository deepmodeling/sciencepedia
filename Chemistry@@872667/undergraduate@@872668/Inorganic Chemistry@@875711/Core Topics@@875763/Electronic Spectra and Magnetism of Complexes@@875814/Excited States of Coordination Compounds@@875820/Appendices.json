The observed color is the complement of the absorbed color. The problem states that the aqueous solution of the complex appears bright yellow. We need to determine which color of light is absorbed by the solution to produce this observed yellow color.\n\nThe visible spectrum of light can be represented as a color wheel where complementary colors are opposite each other. The sequence of colors in the visible spectrum is Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, and Violet (ROYGBV).\n- Red is complementary to Green-Blue.\n- Orange is complementary to Blue.\n- Yellow is complementary to Violet.\n\nSince the solution appears yellow, it must be absorbing light in the complementary region of the spectrum, which is the violet-blue region.\n\nNow, we need to estimate the energy corresponding to violet-blue light in the units of wavenumbers (cm⁻¹). The visible light spectrum spans approximately from 400 nm (violet) to 700 nm (red).\n- Violet/blue light corresponds to the shorter wavelength, higher energy end of the visible spectrum. A reasonable estimate for the wavelength of maximum absorbance, $\\lambda_{max}$, for violet-blue light is in the range of 400 nm to 450 nm.\n\nThe energy of an electronic transition expressed in wavenumbers, $\\tilde{\\nu}$, is the reciprocal of the wavelength, $\\lambda$.
