The spin-only magnetic moment can be calculated relatively simply, but the orbital contribution is often \"quenched\" or eliminated by the ligand field. However, in certain cases, a significant orbital contribution remains, leading to an experimental magnetic moment that is considerably different from the spin-only value. This phenomenon is directly linked to the degeneracy of the ground state electronic term.\n\nConsider two different octahedral complexes of a metal ion with a $d^4$ electron configuration. One complex is high-spin, resulting from a weak-field ligand environment, while the other is low-spin, resulting from a strong-field ligand environment. It is observed that the low-spin complex exhibits a magnetic moment that suggests a significant orbital contribution, whereas the magnetic moment of the high-spin complex is very close to its spin-only value.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the correct fundamental reason for this observed difference in magnetic behavior?\n\nA. The low-spin $d^4$ complex has a ground state term with T symmetry (which is orbitally triply degenerate), allowing for orbital angular momentum. In contrast, the high-spin $d^4$ complex has a ground state term with E symmetry (which is orbitally doubly degenerate), for which the orbital angular momentum is quenched.\n\nB. The high-spin $d^4$ complex has more unpaired electrons, and the resulting large spin-exchange energy completely cancels any possible orbital contribution, a phenomenon not seen in the low-spin case.\n\nC. The low-spin configuration ($t_{2g}^4$) is spherically symmetric, which enhances orbital motion, while the high-spin configuration ($t_{2g}^3 e_g^1$) is asymmetric, which restricts it.\n\nD. The Jahn-Teller effect, which is the sole source of orbital angular momentum, is much more pronounced in low-spin $d^4$ complexes than in high-spin $d^4$ complexes.\n\nE. Orbital contribution to the magnetic moment is only possible when the higher-energy $e_g$ orbitals are completely empty, a condition that is met only by the low-spin $d^4$ complex.", "solution": "The spin-only magnetic moment for a complex with $n$ unpaired electrons is given by\n$$\n\\mu_{\\text{SO}}=\\sqrt{n(n+2)}\\,\\mu_{\\mathrm{B}},\n$$\nwhich ignores any orbital contribution.

In an octahedral field, the components of the orbital angular momentum operator transform as $T_{1g}$, and only terms that carry an effective orbital angular momentum (i.e., transform like a triply degenerate $T$ representation) support an unquenched orbital moment to first order. By contrast, $A$ terms are nondegenerate and $E$ terms, although doubly degenerate, do not carry an effective orbital angular momentum in first order; they are usually treated as having $\\tilde{L}=0$, so their orbital contribution is largely quenched.\n\nFor a $d^{4}$ ion:\n- In a weak-field (high-spin) octahedral complex, the configuration is $t_{2g}^{3}e_{g}^{1}$ with $S=2$ (fivefold spin multiplicity). The ground term correlates as $^{5}E_{g}$ (from the free-ion $^{5}D$ term). An $E$ term is orbitally doubly degenerate but corresponds to $\\tilde{L}=0$ in first order, so the orbital angular momentum is quenched and the observed magnetic moment is close to $\\mu_{\\text{SO}}$.\n- In a strong-field (low-spin) octahedral complex, the configuration is $t_{2g}^{4}$ with $S=1$ (threefold spin multiplicity). The ground term is $^{3}T_{1g}$, which is triply orbitally degenerate and carries an effective orbital angular momentum $\\tilde{L}=1$. This permits first-order spin-orbit coupling within the $T$ manifold and yields a significant orbital contribution to the magnetic moment.\n\nTherefore, the fundamental reason for the observed difference is the difference in orbital degeneracy of the ground electronic term: the low-spin $d^{4}$ complex has a $T$-symmetry ground term that allows unquenched orbital angular momentum, while the high-spin $d^{4}$ complex has an $E$-symmetry ground term for which orbital angular momentum is quenched in first order. This corresponds exactly to statement A. The other options are incorrect: spin-exchange does not cancel orbital contributions (B); $t_{2g}^{4}$ is not spherically symmetric (C); the Jahn-Teller effect is not the sole source of orbital angular momentum and generally lifts degeneracy, tending to quench it (D); and occupancy of $e_{g}$ is not the criterion for orbital contributions (E).", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2275688"}, {"introduction": "The principles governing orbital contribution to magnetic moments are not limited to octahedral complexes.
