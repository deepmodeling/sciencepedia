This change depends on the nature of the frontier molecular orbitals: the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) and the Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO).

A molecule with a higher-energy HOMO is generally a better electron donor, while one with a lower-energy LUMO is a better electron acceptor.\n\nConsider two simple hydrides from Group 16 of the periodic table: water ($H_2O$) and hydrogen sulfide ($H_2S$).

In bent $H_2O$ and $H_2S$, the HOMO is a nonbonding lone pair centered on the chalcogen, dominated by a $p$-type orbital on the central atom.
