It adopts a tetrahedral geometry, analogous to methane, $\\text{CH}_4$. A qualitative molecular orbital (MO) diagram for $\\text{BH}_4^-$ can be constructed to understand its electronic structure and bonding.\n\nThis construction involves combining the valence atomic orbitals of the central boron atom (2s and 2p) with Symmetry Adapted Linear Combinations (SALCs) of the four peripheral hydrogen 1s orbitals. In the tetrahedral ($T_d$) point group, the boron 2s orbital has $a_1$ symmetry, and the three degenerate boron 2p orbitals transform as a set with $t_2$ symmetry. The four hydrogen 1s orbitals can be combined to form two sets of SALCs: one combination possesses $a_1$ symmetry, and a set of three degenerate combinations possesses $t_2$ symmetry.\n\nAssume the relative energy ordering of the initial orbitals is such that the boron 2p orbitals are highest in energy, the hydrogen 1s SALCs are at an intermediate energy, and the boron 2s orbital is lowest in energy.

The anion $\\text{BH}_{4}^{-}$ has tetrahedral geometry, so the point group is $T_{d}$. The central boron valence orbitals transform as $a_{1}$ for $2s$ and $t_{2}$ for the three $2p$ orbitals. The four hydrogen $1s$ orbitals form a reducible representation that reduces to $a_{1} + t_{2}$, so their SALCs are one $a_{1}$ SALC and one triply degenerate $t_{2}$ SALC.\n\nUse the given relative energy ordering to determine interactions.

The HOMO is the $1e$ orbital.", "solution": "The problem asks for the ground-state valence electron configuration and the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) of the hydronium ion, $H_3O^+$, which has a pyramidal ($C_{3v}$) geometry.\n\n**Step 1: Determine the total number of valence electrons.**\nOxygen is in Group 16, so it has 6 valence electrons.\nHydrogen is in Group 1, so each H atom has 1 valence electron.\nThe species has a +1 charge, which means one electron is removed from the neutral count.\nTotal valence electrons = (1 * O) + (3 * H) - 1 = 6 + 3(1) - 1 = 8 electrons.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the symmetry of the central atom's (Oxygen) valence orbitals.**\nThe basis set for oxygen is the 2s and 2p orbitals. We use the $C_{3v}$ character table to find their irreducible representations.\n- The 2s orbital is spherically symmetric, so it always transforms as the totally symmetric representation, which is $A_1$ in any point group. So, O(2s) has $a_1$ symmetry.\n- The 2p orbitals are treated as vectors. The $p_z$ orbital lies along the principal axis ($z$-axis). From the character table, the function $z$ transforms as $A_1$. So, O(2pz) has $a_1$ symmetry.\n- The ($p_x, p_y$) orbitals transform together as a degenerate pair. The character table shows that $(x, y)$ transforms as the $E$ representation. So, O(2px, 2py) have $e$ symmetry.\nIn summary, the valence orbitals of the central oxygen atom provide symmetries: $2a_1 + e$.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the symmetry of the ligand group orbitals (Symmetry Adapted Linear Combinations, or SALCs).**\nThe ligands are the three hydrogen atoms, and the basis set is their 1s orbitals. To find the symmetries of the SALCs, we determine the reducible representation, $\\Gamma_{\\text{H}_{1s}}$, by applying the symmetry operations of the $C_{3v}$ group to the three H 1s orbitals and counting how many remain in their original position.\n- $E$: The identity operation leaves all 3 H atoms unshifted. The character is $\\chi(E) = 3$.\n- $C_3$: A rotation by 120 degrees about the principal axis moves all H atoms to new positions. The character is $\\chi(C_3) = 0$.\n- $\\sigma_v$: A reflection through a vertical mirror plane that contains one O-H bond leaves that one H atom unshifted, while the other two are interchanged. The character is $\\chi(\\sigma_v) = 1$.\nSo, the reducible representation for the H 1s orbitals is $\\Gamma_{\\text{H}_{1s}} = (3, 0, 1)$.\n\nNow, we reduce this representation to its constituent irreducible representations using the formula:\n$n(\\text{Irr}) = \\frac{1}{h} \\sum_{\\text{classes}} N \\cdot \\chi_R \\cdot \\chi_I$\nwhere $h$ is the order of the group (for $C_{3v}$, $h=1+2+3=6$), $N$ is the number of operations in the class, $\\chi_R$ is the character of the reducible representation, and $\\chi_I$ is the character of the irreducible representation.\n\n- $n(A_1) = \\frac{1}{6} [(1)(3)(1) + (2)(0)(1) + (3)(1)(1)] = \\frac{1}{6}[3+0+3] = 1$.\n- $n(A_2) = \\frac{1}{6} [(1)(3)(1) + (2)(0)(1) + (3)(1)(-1)] = \\frac{1}{6}[3+0-3] = 0$.\n- $n(E) = \\frac{1}{6} [(1)(3)(2) + (2)(0)(-1) + (3)(1)(0)] = \\frac{1}{6}[6+0+0] = 1$.\n\nThus, the H 1s orbitals combine to form SALCs with symmetries $a_1 + e$.\n\n**Step 4: Construct the Molecular Orbital (MO) diagram.**\nWe combine atomic orbitals and SALCs of the same symmetry to form bonding and antibonding MOs.\n- **$a_1$ symmetry:** We have two $a_1$ orbitals from Oxygen (2s and 2pz) and one $a_1$ SALC from the hydrogens. These three orbitals will combine to form three MOs of $a_1$ symmetry. In order of increasing energy, these are a strongly bonding MO ($1a_1$), a largely non-bonding MO ($2a_1$), and a strongly antibonding MO ($3a_1^*$).\n- **$e$ symmetry:** We have one set of $e$ orbitals from Oxygen (2px, 2py) and one set of $e$ SALCs from the hydrogens. These will combine to form a degenerate pair of bonding MOs ($1e$) and a degenerate pair of antibonding MOs ($2e^*$).\n\n**Step 5: Determine the energy ordering of the MOs and fill with electrons.**\nThe energy ordering for pyramidal $XY_3$ molecules like $NH_3$ and $H_3O^+$ is well-established. The bonding orbitals are lowest in energy, followed by the non-bonding orbital, and then the antibonding orbitals.\n- The lowest energy MO is the $1a_1$ bonding orbital, formed from the in-phase combination of the O 2s and the $a_1$ H SALC.\n- The next lowest are the degenerate $1e$ bonding orbitals, from the O 2p and $e$ H SALCs.\n- The next orbital is the $2a_1$ orbital. This is largely a non-bonding orbital, primarily composed of the O 2pz orbital, which points away from the hydrogen atoms. This is the lone pair orbital.\n- Higher in energy are the antibonding orbitals, $2e^*$ and $3a_1^*$.\n\nThe energy order for the occupied and low-lying unoccupied orbitals is: $1a_1 < 1e < 2a_1 < 2e^* < \\dots$\n\nNow, we fill these orbitals with the 8 valence electrons:\n- The $1a_1$ orbital holds 2 electrons: $(1a_1)^2$.\n- The degenerate $1e$ orbitals hold 4 electrons: $(1e)^4$.\n- The $2a_1$ orbital holds the remaining 2 electrons: $(2a_1)^2$.\n\nThe final ground-state valence electron configuration is $(1a_1)^2 (1e)^4 (2a_1)^2$. The Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) is the last orbital to be filled, which is the $2a_1$ orbital.\n\n**Step 6: Evaluate the given options.**\n- A. The ground-state configuration is $(1a_1)^2 (1e)^4 (2a_1)^2$. The HOMO is the $2a_1$ orbital. This matches our derivation.\n- B. The ground-state configuration is $(1a_1)^2 (2a_1)^2 (1e)^4$. The HOMO is the $1e$ orbital. This incorrectly places the non-bonding $2a_1$ orbital below the bonding $1e$ set.\n- C. The ground-state configuration is $(1a_1')^2 (1e')^4 (1a_2'')^2$. The HOMO is the $1a_2''$ orbital. This uses symmetry labels for the $D_{3h}$ point group, which would correspond to a planar geometry, not the stated pyramidal geometry.\n- D. The ground-state configuration is $(1a_1)^2 (1e)^4$. The HOMO is the $1e$ orbital. This uses only 6 valence electrons instead of the correct 8.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct answer. The MO description is very similar to the isoelectronic ammonia molecule ($NH_3$), which also has the configuration $(1a_1)^2 (1e)^4 (2a_1)^2$ and a HOMO of $a_1$ symmetry corresponding to its lone pair. The primary difference is that the orbitals of $H_3O^+$ are all lower in energy than their counterparts in $NH_3$ due to the greater nuclear charge of oxygen and the overall positive charge of the ion.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2272531"}, {"introduction": "Molecular orbital theory truly shines when explaining molecules that are challenging for simpler models, such as the so-called \"hypervalent\" triiodide ion, $I_3^-$.
