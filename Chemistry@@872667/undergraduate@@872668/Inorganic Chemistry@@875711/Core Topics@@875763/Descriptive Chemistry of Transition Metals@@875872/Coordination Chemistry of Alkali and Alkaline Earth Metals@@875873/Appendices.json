One strategy is to add a chemical agent to the water that sequesters the calcium ions ($Ca^{2+}$) by forming a stable, soluble coordination complex. This effectively keeps the $Ca^{2+}$ ions in solution.\n\nYou are tasked with evaluating three potential sequestering agents based on their fundamental chemical properties. The agents are the solvent itself, and two additives provided as their sodium salts. The three ligands to be compared for their ability to bind $Ca^{2+}$ are: water ($\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$), the acetate ion ($\\text{CH}_3\\text{COO}^−$), and the oxalate ion ($\\text{C}_2\\text{O}_4^{2−}$).\n\nBased on the principles of coordination chemistry, including ligand charge, donor atoms, and denticity, determine the correct ranking of these three species in order of their sequestering effectiveness for $Ca^{2+}$, from least effective to most effective.\n\nA.

According to HSAB theory, hard acids prefer to bind hard bases, particularly oxygen donors, and binding strength increases with ligand basicity and negative charge.\n\nNext, characterize each ligand:\n- $\\text{H}_2\\text{O}$ is a neutral, hard oxygen donor and is monodentate. It forms aqua complexes by simple coordination without chelation.\n- $\\text{Ac}^-$ has one negative charge and two oxygen atoms; however, as a chelator it would form a four-membered ring, which is generally unfavorable, so it typically binds as a monodentate O-donor to $\\text{Ca}^{2+}$ (or bridges metals) rather than forming a stable chelate. Its anionic charge increases Lewis basicity relative to water.\n- $\\text{Ox}^{2-}$ is dianionic with two carboxylate groups, providing two oxygen donors that bind simultaneously to form a five-membered chelate ring.

Hence, chelation further amplifies the stability of the oxalate complex.\n\nCombining HSAB, ligand charge, and denticity leads to the inequality\n$$ K_{f,1}^{\\text{Ox}} \\gg K_{f,1}^{\\text{Ac}} \\gg K_{f}^{\\text{H}_2\\text{O}}, $$\nso the sequestering effectiveness increases in the order\n$$ \\text{H}_2\\text{O}  \\text{Ac}^-  \\text{Ox}^{2-}. $$\n\nTherefore, from least effective to most effective: Water  Acetate  Oxalate, which corresponds to option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2240921"}, {"introduction": "Just as the ligand's properties influence complex stability, so too do the intrinsic properties of the central metal ion.

This problem [@problem_id:2240879] asks you to analyze the relative stabilities of EDTA complexes with two different alkaline earth metals, $Mg^{2+}$ and $Sr^{2+}$, prompting you to apply the concept of charge density to explain trends in complex formation constants.", "problem": "In coordination chemistry, the stability of a complex in solution is quantified by its formation constant, $K_f$. A common chelating agent used to sequester metal ions is the anion of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), which is a hexadentate ligand. Consider a solution containing both magnesium ($Mg^{2+}$) and strontium ($Sr^{2+}$) ions. Both ions are alkaline earth metals and form 1:1 octahedral complexes with the EDTA anion ($EDTA^{4-}$), resulting in complex ions with a charge of 2-, namely $[\\text{Mg(EDTA)}]^{2-}$ and $[\\text{Sr(EDTA)}]^{2-}$.\n\nBased on the fundamental principles governing the stability of coordination complexes, which of the following statements correctly compares the formation constants for these two complexes and provides the most accurate chemical reasoning?\n\nA. The formation constant for $[Sr(EDTA)]^{2-}$ is larger than for $[Mg(EDTA)]^{2-}$ because the larger ionic radius of $Sr^{2+}$ provides a better steric fit for the large EDTA ligand.\nB. The formation constant for $[Mg(EDTA)]^{2-}$ is larger than for $[Sr(EDTA)]^{2-}$ because $Mg^{2+}$ has a higher charge density, leading to stronger electrostatic interactions with the ligand's donor atoms.\nC. The formation constant for $[Sr(EDTA)]^{2-}$ is larger than for $[Mg(EDTA)]^{2-}$ because Strontium is more polarizable, which enhances covalent bonding character with the EDTA ligand.\nD. The formation constants are approximately equal because both $Mg^{2+}$ and $Sr^{2+}$ are in the same group, have the same +2 charge, and EDTA is a strong, non-selective chelating agent.\nE. The formation constant for $[Mg(EDTA)]^{2-}$ is larger than for $[Sr(EDTA)]^{2-}$ because Magnesium is more electronegative than Strontium.", "solution": "The problem asks us to compare the stability, as measured by the formation constant ($K_f$), of the EDTA complexes of $Mg^{2+}$ and $Sr^{2+}$. The formation of these complexes can be represented by the equilibrium reaction:\n$$ M^{2+}(aq) + EDTA^{4-}(aq) \\rightleftharpoons [\\text{M(EDTA)}]^{2-}(aq) $$\nwhere M can be either Mg or Sr.\n\nThe formation constant for this reaction is given by:\n$$ K_f = \\frac{[[\\text{M(EDTA)}]^{2-}]}{[M^{2+}][EDTA^{4-}]} $$\nA larger value of $K_f$ indicates a more stable complex, meaning the equilibrium lies further to the right, favoring the formation of the complex ion.\n\nThe stability of coordination complexes formed by metal ions with a given ligand is influenced by several factors. When comparing ions within the same group of the periodic table, such as the alkaline earth metals ($Mg^{2+}$ and $Sr^{2+}$), the ions have the same charge (+2). Therefore, the primary factor determining the stability of their complexes with a hard Lewis base ligand like EDTA (which has oxygen and nitrogen donor atoms) is the charge density of the cation.\n\nCharge density is defined as the ratio of an ion's charge to its size (ionic radius or volume).\n$$ \\text{Charge Density} \\propto \\frac{\\text{Charge}}{\\text{Ionic Radius}} $$\n\nLet's compare the ionic radii of $Mg^{2+}$ and $Sr^{2+}$. Both magnesium and strontium are in Group 2 of the periodic table. Ionic radius increases as one moves down a group because additional electron shells are added. Magnesium is in Period 3, while Strontium is in Period 5. Therefore, the ionic radius of $Sr^{2+}$ is significantly larger than that of $Mg^{2+}$.\n$$ r_{Mg^{2+}}  r_{Sr^{2+}} $$\n\nSince both ions have the same charge ($+2$), the ion with the smaller radius will have the higher charge density. Consequently, $Mg^{2+}$ has a higher charge density than $Sr^{2+}$.\n\nA higher charge density on the central metal cation leads to a stronger electrostatic attraction to the electron-donating atoms of the ligand. In this case, the positively charged $Mg^{2+}$ ion will more strongly attract the negatively charged carboxylate groups and the lone pairs on the nitrogen atoms of the EDTA ligand compared to the less charge-dense $Sr^{2+}$ ion. This stronger electrostatic interaction results in a more stable metal-ligand bond.\n\nA more stable bond corresponds to a more stable complex, which in turn is reflected by a larger formation constant, $K_f$. Therefore, the formation constant for $[Mg(EDTA)]^{2-}$ is larger than that for $[Sr(EDTA)]^{2-}$.\n$$ K_f([\\text{Mg(EDTA)}]^{2-})  K_f([\\text{Sr(EDTA)}]^{2-}) $$\nThis reasoning directly matches the statement in option B.\n\nLet's analyze the other options to see why they are incorrect:\n- **Option A:** This suggests a \"best fit\" or \"lock-and-key\" model where the larger $Sr^{2+}$ ion fits better into the EDTA 'cavity'. While steric factors can be important, for ions of this type with a flexible ligand like EDTA, the electrostatic interaction (charge density) is the dominant factor. The idea of a rigid cavity with an optimal size is an oversimplification and incorrect in this context.\n- **Option C:** While polarizability increases down a group ($Sr^{2+}$ is more polarizable than $Mg^{2+}$), this factor is more significant for interactions with soft ligands (due to increased covalent character). EDTA, with its N and O donors, is considered a hard ligand, making the interaction primarily electrostatic. Therefore, charge density is the dominant principle, not polarizability.\n- **Option D:** This option incorrectly assumes that because the ions are in the same group and have the same charge, their complex stability will be the same. This ignores the significant effect of the differing ionic radii and resulting charge densities.\n- **Option E:** While it correctly concludes that the Mg complex is more stable, it provides the wrong reason. Electronegativity is a measure of an atom's ability to attract electrons in a covalent bond. While related to electrostatic attraction, charge density is the more direct and appropriate concept for explaining the bond strength in these predominantly ionic/electrostatic coordination complexes. The higher charge density of $Mg^{2+}$ is the most precise explanation.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2240879"}]}
