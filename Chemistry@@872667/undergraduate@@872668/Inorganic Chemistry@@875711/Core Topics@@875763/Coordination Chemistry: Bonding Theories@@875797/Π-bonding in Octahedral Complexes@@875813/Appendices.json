In an ideal octahedral ligand field, the five $d$ orbitals split into a lower-energy $t_{2g}$ set and a higher-energy $e_{g}$ set, with splitting magnitude defined as\n$$\n\\Delta_{o} \\equiv E(e_{g}) - E(t_{2g}).\n$$\nFor a given metal ion, $\\Delta_{o}$ depends on the ligand field strength arising from metal-ligand interactions. Two key contributions are:\n- $\\sigma$-donation from the ligand to the metal, which increases the antibonding character and energy of the $e_{g}$ orbitals, thereby increasing $\\Delta_{o}$.\n- $\\pi$ interactions: \n  - $\\pi$-acceptor ligands accept electron density via backbonding from the metal $t_{2g}$ orbitals into ligand $\\pi^{*}$ orbitals, stabilizing (lowering) the $t_{2g}$ energy. This increases $\\Delta_{o}$.\n  - $\\pi$-donor ligands donate electron density into the metal $t_{2g}$ orbitals, raising $t_{2g}$ energy. This decreases $\\Delta_{o}$.\n\nApplying these principles to the ligands:\n- $CO$ is a strong $\\sigma$ donor and a strong $\\pi$ acceptor. The $\\sigma$ interaction raises $E(e_{g})$ and the $\\pi$ backbonding lowers $E(t_{2g})$, both effects increasing $\\Delta_{o}$.

This thought experiment challenges you to apply your knowledge of π-donor interactions to a specific scenario involving a $d^4$ metal center [@problem_id:2300889]. By analyzing how strong π-donation influences $\\Delta_o$, you can predict the resulting magnetic properties and solidify your understanding of how these ligands create a weak-field environment.", "problem": "Consider a hypothetical transition metal, M, which forms a six-coordinate octahedral complex $[M(L)_6]^{n+}$. The ligands, L, are exclusively σ-donors. The central metal ion has a $d^4$ electron configuration, and experimental measurements show that the complex is in a high-spin state.\n\nThe entire set of ligands L is then replaced by a new set of ligands, L', to form the complex $[M(L')_6]^{n+}$. The ligands L' are known to be strong aza-π-donors.\n\nAssuming the complex remains perfectly octahedral and the oxidation state of the metal M does not change, calculate the change in the number of unpaired electrons on the metal center. The change is defined as the final number of unpaired electrons minus the initial number of unpaired electrons.", "solution": "Step 1: Analyze the initial state of the complex $[M(L)_6]^{n+}$.\nThe complex is octahedral, meaning the five degenerate d-orbitals of the metal ion M are split into two sets: a lower-energy triply degenerate set ($t_{2g}$) and a higher-energy doubly degenerate set ($e_g$). The energy difference between these sets is the crystal field splitting energy, $\\Delta_o$.\nThe metal ion has a $d^4$ electron configuration.\nThe problem states the complex is high-spin. This implies that the energy cost to pair two electrons in a single orbital (the pairing energy, $P$) is greater than the energy required to promote an electron from the $t_{2g}$ set to the $e_g$ set ($\\Delta_o$). Therefore, for the initial complex, $\\Delta_o  P$.\nTo maximize the spin multiplicity (Hund's rule), the electrons will singly occupy orbitals before pairing. The electron configuration for a high-spin $d^4$ system is $(t_{2g})^3(e_g)^1$.\nIn this configuration, there are three unpaired electrons in the $t_{2g}$ orbitals and one unpaired electron in the $e_g$ orbitals. The initial number of unpaired electrons is $3 + 1 = 4$.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the effect of changing ligands from L to L'.\nThe initial ligands, L, are σ-donors only. In this model, the $t_{2g}$ orbitals are non-bonding, while the $e_g$ orbitals are antibonding (due to head-on σ-interactions with ligand orbitals).\nThe new ligands, L', are strong π-donors. This means they possess filled orbitals of π-symmetry that can overlap with the metal's $t_{2g}$ orbitals. According to ligand field theory incorporating molecular orbitals, this interaction leads to the formation of a low-energy bonding MO (of π symmetry) and a high-energy antibonding MO (of π* symmetry). The metal's $t_{2g}$ electrons occupy the resulting antibonding $t_{2g}^*$ orbitals. This interaction raises the energy of the metal's $t_{2g}$ orbitals relative to their position in a σ-only complex.\nThe energy of the $e_g$ orbitals, which are of σ-symmetry, is not affected by this π-interaction.\nAs a result, the energy gap between the newly formed $t_{2g}^*$ orbitals and the $e_g$ orbitals is reduced. Let the new splitting energy be $\\Delta_o'$. The effect of π-donation is to decrease the crystal field splitting energy, so $\\Delta_o'  \\Delta_o$. Ligands that cause a smaller $\\Delta_o$ are termed weak-field ligands. Thus, strong π-donors act as weak-field ligands.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the final state of the complex $[M(L')_6]^{n+}$.\nThe metal ion is still $d^4$ in an octahedral environment. The spin state of the final complex depends on the comparison between the new splitting energy $\\Delta_o'$ and the pairing energy $P$.\nWe established the initial condition for the high-spin state: $\\Delta_o  P$.\nWe also established that the introduction of strong π-donor ligands decreases the splitting energy: $\\Delta_o'  \\Delta_o$.\nCombining these two inequalities, we find that $\\Delta_o'  \\Delta_o  P$. The condition for a high-spin complex, $\\Delta_o'  P$, is still satisfied and, in fact, is even more favored.\nTherefore, the final complex $[M(L')_6]^{n+}$ will also be in a high-spin state.\nThe electron configuration for the final high-spin $d^4$ complex remains $(t_{2g})^3(e_g)^1$.\nThe final number of unpaired electrons is 4.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the change in the number of unpaired electrons.\nThe change is defined as the final number of unpaired electrons minus the initial number of unpaired electrons.\nChange = (Final unpaired electrons) - (Initial unpaired electrons)\nChange = $4 - 4 = 0$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{0}$$", "id": "2300889"}, {"introduction": "Real-world chemical analysis often involves comparing related species to uncover subtle electronic effects that govern reactivity and physical properties.

The crystal field splitting energy, $\\Delta_o$, is greater for $[Fe(CN)_6]^{4-}$ than for $[Cr(CO)_6]$ because the cyanide ligand is anionic, leading to stronger electrostatic interactions.\n\nB.

The Fe-C bond in $[Fe(CN)_6]^{4-}$ is significantly stronger and shorter than the Cr-C bond in $[Cr(CO)_6]$ due to the formal $+2$ charge on the iron center compared to the formal $0$ charge on chromium.", "solution": "We compare the two isoelectronic octahedral $d^{6}$ complexes $[Fe(CN)_{6}]^{4-}$ and $[Cr(CO)_{6}]$ using molecular orbital considerations.\n\n1) Electron configurations and ligand field splitting.\n- For strong-field octahedral ligands, a $d^{6}$ metal adopts the low-spin configuration $t_{2g}^{6}e_{g}^{0}$. Define the octahedral splitting as $\\Delta_{o} = E(e_{g}) - E(t_{2g})$.\n- In the MO picture, $\\sigma$ donation from the ligand raises the $e_{g}$ set (metal-ligand $\\sigma$ antibonding). $\\pi$ backbonding corresponds to donation from the metal $t_{2g}$ orbitals into ligand $\\pi^{*}$ orbitals, which stabilizes $t_{2g}$ (lowers its energy). Therefore, stronger $\\pi$-acceptor ligands both lower $E(t_{2g})$ and increase $\\Delta_{o}$.\n\n2) Relative $\\pi$-acceptor abilities and consequences.\n- The ligand CO has lower-lying $\\pi^{*}$ orbitals and is a stronger $\\pi$-acceptor than CN$^{-}$. In second-order perturbation terms, the stabilization of $t_{2g}$ due to mixing with ligand $\\pi^{*}$ is approximately\n$$\n\\Delta E(t_{2g}) \\approx -\\frac{V_{\\pi}^{2}}{\\Delta_{\\pi}},\n$$\nwhere $V_{\\pi}$ is the metal-ligand $\\pi$ coupling and $\\Delta_{\\pi} = E(\\pi^{*}) - E(t_{2g})$. A smaller $\\Delta_{\\pi}$ (as for CO) yields a larger negative shift, i.e., a lower $E(t_{2g})$.\n- Consequently, $E(t_{2g})$ is lower in $[Cr(CO)_{6}]$ than in $[Fe(CN)_{6}]^{4-}$, and because $e_{g}$ is antibonding with respect to $\\sigma$ donation while $t_{2g}$ is further stabilized by stronger $\\pi$ backbonding, the overall $\\Delta_{o}$ is larger for $[Cr(CO)_{6}]$.\n\n3) Oxidation state and backbonding.\n- Backbonding increases as the metal becomes more electron rich and the ligand $\\pi^{*}$ orbitals are lower in energy. Although $[Fe(CN)_{6}]^{4-}$ is an anionic complex, the metal is $Fe^{2+}$ (higher oxidation state) while $[Cr(CO)_{6}]$ has $Cr^{0}$ (lower oxidation state), which generally favors greater backbonding in the carbonyl complex. Together with CO being the stronger $\\pi$-acceptor, the extent of $\\pi$ backbonding is greater in $[Cr(CO)_{6}]$.\n\n4) Internal ligand bond orders.\n- $\\pi$ backbonding populates ligand $\\pi^{*}$ orbitals, reducing the internal ligand bond order. Because CO is the stronger $\\pi$-acceptor and receives greater backbonding in $[Cr(CO)_{6}]$, the C-O bond order is reduced more in $[Cr(CO)_{6}]$ than the C-N bond order is in $[Fe(CN)_{6}]^{4-}$.
