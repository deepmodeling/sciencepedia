One such candidate is a coordination complex where a central iron(III) ion, $Fe^{3+}$, is surrounded by six ligands in an octahedral geometry. Spectroscopic measurements reveal that this complex exhibits high-spin behavior, meaning the electrons preferentially occupy higher energy orbitals before pairing up in lower energy orbitals. Based on this information, determine the total number of unpaired electrons in the d-orbitals of the central $Fe^{3+}$ ion in this high-spin octahedral complex.", "solution": "The neutral iron atom has the ground-state electron configuration $[Ar]\\,3d^6 4s^2$. Formation of $Fe^{3+}$ removes electrons first from the $4s$ orbital and then from the $3d$ orbitals due to their relative energies in the ion, so the configuration becomes $[Ar]\\,3d^5$.\n\nIn an octahedral ligand field, the five $d$ orbitals split into the lower-energy $t_{2g}$ set and the higher-energy $e_g$ set, with an energy separation denoted by $\\Delta_o$. For a high-spin complex, the pairing energy $P$ exceeds the crystal field splitting, so electrons occupy different orbitals with parallel spins before pairing, according to Hund’s rule.\n\nFor a $d^5$ ion in a high-spin octahedral field, the electrons distribute as $t_{2g}^3 e_g^2$ with one electron in each of the five $d$ orbitals, all unpaired. Therefore, the total number of unpaired electrons is $5$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{5}$$", "id": "2243523"}, {"introduction": "Once the electron configuration is established, we can quantify the energetic effect of d-orbital splitting by calculating the Crystal Field Stabilization Energy (CFSE). This practice introduces the formula for CFSE in an octahedral field, allowing you to calculate the net stabilization gained by a complex relative to a hypothetical spherical field. Understanding CFSE is crucial for explaining trends in the stability, reaction kinetics, and spectroscopic features of coordination compounds [@problem_id:2243530].", "problem": "In the framework of Crystal Field Theory, the five degenerate d-orbitals of a transition metal ion are split into different energy levels upon the formation of a coordination complex. For an octahedral complex, these orbitals split into a lower-energy triplet set, denoted $t_{2g}$, and a higher-energy doublet set, denoted $e_g$. The energy separation between these sets is defined as the octahedral splitting parameter, $\\Delta_o$.\n\nThe energy of the d-orbitals is measured relative to their average energy in a hypothetical spherical field, known as the barycenter. Each electron occupying a $t_{2g}$ orbital stabilizes the complex by an energy of $-0.4\\Delta_o$, while each electron occupying an $e_g$ orbital destabilizes it by an energy of $+0.6\\Delta_o$. The total energy change due to this effect is called the Crystal Field Stabilization Energy (CFSE).\n\nConsider the hexaamminenickel(II) ion, $[Ni(NH_3)_6]^{2+}$.

Neutral Ni has configuration $[Ar]\\,3d^8 4s^2$; removing two electrons gives $Ni^{2+}: [Ar]\\,3d^8$, so it is a $d^8$ ion.\n\nIn an octahedral field, the five $d$ orbitals split into lower-energy $t_{2g}$ (three orbitals) and higher-energy $e_g$ (two orbitals). For a $d^8$ ion, the energetically favored distribution places six electrons in $t_{2g}$ and two in $e_g$, i.e., $t_{2g}^6 e_g^2$. This occupancy arises regardless of weak- or strong-field considerations because after singly occupying all five $d$ orbitals, the remaining three electrons must pair, and pairing occurs preferentially in the lower-energy $t_{2g}$ set, yielding $t_{2g}^6 e_g^2$.\n\nTherefore,\n$$\n\\text{CFSE} = 6(-0.4\\Delta_o) + 2(+0.6\\Delta_o) = (-2.4 + 1.2)\\Delta_o = -1.2\\Delta_o.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{-1.2\\Delta_o}$$", "id": "2243530"}, {"introduction": "This final practice challenges you to work like a research chemist, using experimental data to deduce the identity of an unknown species.
