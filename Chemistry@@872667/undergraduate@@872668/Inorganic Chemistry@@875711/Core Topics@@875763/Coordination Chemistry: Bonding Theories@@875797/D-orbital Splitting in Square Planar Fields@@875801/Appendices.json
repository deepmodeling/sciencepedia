This follows from sigma-donor ligands lying along the $x$ and $y$ axes: orbitals with lobes pointing directly at ligands are raised the most, those with nodes along the axes are raised less, and those oriented out of plane are stabilized.\n\nAfter removing the ligand at $(0,+a,0)$, the $ML_{3}$ complex is T-shaped with ligands at $(\\pm a,0,0)$ and $(0,-a,0)$. The sigma-repulsion experienced by each $d$ orbital is then evaluated by the alignment of its lobes and nodal planes relative to these three metal–ligand axes.\n\nUse the Cartesian forms of the real $d$ orbitals (proportionalities suffice for angular orientation):\n- $d_{x^2-y^2} \\propto x^2 - y^2$ has four lobes along $\\pm x$ and $\\pm y$ in the $xy$-plane. In the T-shaped field, there are ligands along $+x$, $-x$, and $-y$, so three of the four lobes point directly at ligands. This produces strong sigma repulsion in three directions. Hence $d_{x^2-y^2}$ remains the highest in energy.\n\n- $d_{xy} \\propto xy$ has nodal lines along the $x$ and $y$ axes (zero amplitude toward the ligand directions) with lobes between the axes in the $xy$-plane. For pure sigma donors on the axes, direct sigma overlap is minimized by these nodes. Although there is in-plane electron density (which keeps it above out-of-plane orbitals), the absence of direct axial overlap means $d_{xy}$ is destabilized less than $d_{x^2-y^2}$, and it remains above $d_{z^2}$ as in the square planar case because it is entirely in-plane.\n\n- $d_{z^2} \\propto 2z^2 - x^2 - y^2$ has a torus of density in the $xy$-plane and lobes along $\\pm z$. With no axial ligands, there is no direct sigma repulsion along $z$, and the in-plane torus causes moderate repulsion from the three in-plane ligands. Thus $d_{z^2}$ lies below $d_{xy}$ but above the out-of-plane $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ in a sigma-only field.\n\n- $d_{xz} \\propto xz$ has nodal planes at $x=0$ and $z=0$, so it is zero exactly in the ligand plane and along the axes; however, above and below the plane it has lobes directed toward the $\\pm x$ directions.

In the T-shaped field there is only one ligand on the $y$ axis (at $(0,-a,0)$) and none at $(0,+a,0)$, so $d_{yz}$ suffers less repulsion than $d_{xz}$.
