In octahedral complexes, electronic degeneracy arises from uneven occupancy within the $e_{g}$ or $t_{2g}$ sets. Distortions associated with $e_{g}$ degeneracy couple directly to the axial metal-ligand bonds and are typically strongest; $t_{2g}$-based degeneracies generally lead to weaker effects.\n\nFor each complex, determine the metal oxidation state, the $d^{n}$ count, the spin state, and the octahedral electron configuration using the crystal field splitting into $t_{2g}$ and $e_{g}$ orbitals.\n\nA. $[\\text{Fe}(\\text{CN})_6]^{4-}$: Each $\\text{CN}^-$ contributes charge $-1$, so $6(-1)+x=-4$ gives $x=+2$.

By Hund’s rule and the weak-field condition, the electron configuration is\n$$\nt_{2g}^{5} e_{g}^{2}.\n$$\nThe Jahn-Teller theorem states that any non-linear molecule in a degenerate electronic ground state will undergo a geometric distortion that removes the degeneracy and lowers the total energy. In octahedral complexes, the strongest Jahn-Teller distortions arise when the $e_{g}$ set is unevenly occupied (e.g., $e_{g}^{1}$ or $e_{g}^{3}$), because $e_{g}$ orbitals ($d_{z^{2}}$ and $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$) point directly at ligands and are strongly antibonding. This typically leads to a significant tetragonal elongation or compression.\n\nFor the high-spin $d^{7}$ case, the $e_{g}$ set is evenly occupied with one electron in each $e_{g}$ orbital, so there is no first-order Jahn-Teller driving force from the $e_{g}$ manifold. However, the $t_{2g}^{5}$ configuration is orbitally degenerate in the $t_{2g}$ set (equivalently, it can be viewed as $t_{2g}^{1}$ with a hole), which can produce a Jahn-Teller effect. Because $t_{2g}$ orbitals do not point directly at ligands and are less antibonding, the associated Jahn-Teller distortion is typically weak. The usual outcome is a slight tetragonal distortion (elongation or compression) along a four-fold axis that lifts the residual $t_{2g}$-derived degeneracy:\n$$\nO_{h} \\to D_{4h}, \\quad t_{2g} \\to b_{2g} + e_{g}, \\quad e_{g} \\to a_{1g} + b_{1g}.\n$$\nThus, a weak geometric distortion is expected rather than a strong distortion, a perfect octahedron, a wholesale rearrangement to trigonal prismatic geometry, or a spin-state change (especially since water is a weak-field ligand favoring high spin).\n\nTherefore, the correct expectation is a weak Jahn-Teller distortion with slight elongation or compression along a four-fold axis.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "2294593"}, {"introduction": "Predicting a distortion is one thing, but understanding its consequences for electronic structure is another.

For a $d^9$ metal center, the ideal-octahedral filling is $(t_{2g})^{6}(e_{g})^{3}$, which is electronically degenerate in the $e_{g}$ level. By the Jahn–Teller theorem, this degeneracy is removed by a symmetry-lowering distortion.\n\nFor a tetragonal elongation along the $z$ axis, the axial metal–ligand distances increase. This reduces electrostatic repulsion for orbitals with $z$ character and increases relative repulsion for orbitals oriented toward the equatorial ligands, while preserving the crystal-field barycenter. Consequently:\n- Within the $t_{2g}$ set, the orbitals with $z$ character, $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$, are stabilized relative to $d_{xy}$, so $d_{xz},d_{yz}$ lie below $d_{xy}$.\n- Within the $e_{g}$ set, $d_{z^{2}}$ is stabilized relative to $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$, so $d_{z^{2}}$ lies below $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$.\n- The tetragonal splitting is a perturbation relative to the octahedral splitting parameter, so the $t_{2g}$ levels remain below the $e_{g}$ levels overall.\n\nTherefore, the overall order of increasing energy for a tetragonal elongation is\n$$\nd_{xz}\\approx d_{yz} \\;\\; d_{xy} \\;\\; d_{z^{2}} \\;\\; d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}.\n$$\nFilling $9$ electrons in this order (obeying the Pauli principle and Hund’s rule within each set) yields\n$$\n(d_{xz})^{2}(d_{yz})^{2}(d_{xy})^{2}(d_{z^{2}})^{2}(d_{x^{2}-y^{2}})^{1},\n$$\nwhich matches option B.
