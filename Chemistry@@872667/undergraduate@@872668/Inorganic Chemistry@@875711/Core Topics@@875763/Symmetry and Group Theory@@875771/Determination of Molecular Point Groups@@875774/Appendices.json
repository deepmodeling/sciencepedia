It serves as a precursor for the synthesis of agrochemicals and other specialty chemicals. To understand its spectroscopic properties and reactivity, a correct assignment of its molecular symmetry is essential.\n\nAssume that the molecule is perfectly planar, with the benzene ring forming a regular hexagon. The two chlorine atoms are substituted on adjacent carbon atoms (positions 1 and 2), and the carbon-chlorine and carbon-hydrogen bonds all lie in the plane of the ring.\n\nBased on this idealized geometry, determine the Schönflies symbol representing the point group of the 1,2-dichlorobenzene molecule.\n\nA. $C_{s}$\n\nB. $C_{2v}$\n\nC. $C_{2h}$\n\nD. $D_{2h}$\n\nE. $D_{6h}$", "solution": "We idealize 1,2-dichlorobenzene as a perfectly planar regular hexagon with two identical substituents (Cl) at adjacent ring positions (1 and 2), the remaining four positions bearing H. All atoms lie in the same plane.\n\nBy the definition of a planar molecule, reflection through the molecular plane is a symmetry operation; thus there is at least one mirror plane. However, to classify the point group we must first identify the highest-order proper rotation axis present.\n\nTest a $C_{2}$ axis perpendicular to the ring plane (through the center): a $180^{\\circ}$ rotation about this axis maps position $1 \\to 4$ and $2 \\to 5$, which would interchange Cl with H; hence this operation is not a symmetry. Therefore, no $C_{n}$ axis perpendicular to the plane survives.\n\nNow test $C_{2}$ axes lying in the plane of the ring. In the regular hexagon there are three such axes. The axis that passes through the midpoints of the $1$–$2$ and $4$–$5$ bonds effects the mapping $1 \\leftrightarrow 2$, $3 \\leftrightarrow 6$, and $4 \\leftrightarrow 5$. Because $1$ and $2$ are both Cl and the other mapped pairs are both H, this $C_{2}$ operation is a valid symmetry. The other in-plane $C_{2}$ axes would send a Cl to an H site and thus are not symmetries. Hence there is exactly one $C_{2}$ axis, which we take as the principal axis.\n\nWith that principal $C_{2}$ axis chosen, we identify mirror planes containing it. The molecular plane itself contains this axis, so it is one vertical mirror plane, call it $\\sigma_{v1}$. In addition, the plane perpendicular to the molecular plane that contains the same line (equivalently, reflection in the molecular plane about the line bisecting the $1$–$2$ and $4$–$5$ bonds) is also a mirror plane, $\\sigma_{v2}$, since it maps $1 \\leftrightarrow 2$, $3 \\leftrightarrow 6$, and $4 \\leftrightarrow 5$.\n\nThere is no inversion center (since inversion would map $1 \\to 4$ and $2 \\to 5$, mixing Cl and H), so $C_{2h}$ and $D_{2h}$ are excluded. There is only one $C_{2}$ axis, so $D$ groups are excluded. More than one mirror plane is present, so $C_{s}$ is excluded.

Consequently, $C_{4}^{2}$ gives a $C_{2}$ about the same axis.\n\nNext, check for $C_{2}$ axes perpendicular to the principal axis. Rotations by $180^{\\circ}$ about axes in the molecular plane through xenon preserve the structure:\n- Axes along the Xe–F bond directions (the $x$- and $y$-axes) are $C_{2}'$ axes.\n- Axes along the directions bisecting F–Xe–F angles (through the midpoints of opposite F–F edges) are $C_{2}''$ axes.\nThe presence of $C_{2}$ axes perpendicular to the principal $C_{4}$ confirms a dihedral family $D_{4}$ core.\n\nThen, identify mirror planes. The molecular plane itself is perpendicular to the principal axis and is a mirror plane, so $\\sigma_{h}$ is present. Additionally, there are planes containing the $z$-axis and either passing through opposite Xe–F bonds (these are $\\sigma_{v}$) or bisecting the F–Xe–F angles (these are $\\sigma_{d}$).

Proper rotations preserve radial distance from the center, and inversion maps a point at radius $r$ to another point at radius $r$ in the opposite direction. Thus, no operation interchanges C and H.\n\nIdentify the symmetry elements:\n- There are three mutually perpendicular $C_{4}$ axes through the centers of opposite faces of the cube.
