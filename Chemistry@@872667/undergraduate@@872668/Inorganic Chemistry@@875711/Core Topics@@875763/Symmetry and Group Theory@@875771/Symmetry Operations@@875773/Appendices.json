Consider the *trans*-1,2-dichloroethene molecule (ClHC=CHCl), which is known to be a planar molecule. Its structure consists of two carbon atoms joined by a double bond, with each carbon also bonded to one hydrogen atom and one chlorine atom. The two chlorine atoms are on opposite sides of the carbon-carbon double bond.\n\nFrom the list of symmetry operations provided below, identify all operations that are present in this molecule.

We can orient it such that it lies in the $xy$-plane, with the center of the C=C double bond at the origin (0,0,0) and the C=C bond aligned along the $x$-axis. In this configuration, the two carbon atoms are located at approximately $(\\pm a, 0, 0)$. The chlorine and hydrogen atoms are also in the $xy$-plane. Because it is the *trans* isomer, one Cl and one H are attached to the carbon at $(a, 0, 0)$, and the other Cl and H are attached to the carbon at $(-a, 0, 0)$, with the two Cl atoms on opposite sides of the C=C bond. For instance, one Cl might be at a positive $y$ value and the other at a negative $y$ value.\n\nNow, we evaluate each option:\n\nA. **A rotation about a two-fold axis of symmetry ($C_2$)**: A $C_2$ operation is a rotation by $180^\\circ$. Let's consider an axis passing through the origin and perpendicular to the molecular plane (the $z$-axis). Rotating the molecule by $180^\\circ$ around the $z$-axis will exchange the positions of the two carbon atoms, the two chlorine atoms, and the two hydrogen atoms. The resulting orientation is indistinguishable from the original. Therefore, a $C_2$ axis exists, and the $C_2$ operation is a valid symmetry operation for the molecule. This makes option A correct. This $C_2$ axis is the principal axis because it is the rotation axis of the highest order.\n\nB. **A reflection through a horizontal mirror plane ($\\sigma_h$)**: A horizontal mirror plane, $\\sigma_h$, is defined as a mirror plane that is perpendicular to the principal axis of rotation. As established in the previous step, the principal axis is the $C_2$ axis along the $z$-direction. The plane of the molecule itself (the $xy$-plane) is perpendicular to this axis. A reflection through the $xy$-plane leaves all atoms in their original positions since they all lie within this plane. Thus, the molecular plane is a $\\sigma_h$ plane. This makes option B correct.\n\nC. **A reflection through a vertical mirror plane ($\\sigma_v$)**: A vertical mirror plane, $\\sigma_v$, must contain the principal axis (the $C_2$ axis, i.e., the $z$-axis). Consider a potential $\\sigma_v$ plane like the $xz$-plane, which contains the C=C bond. Reflecting the molecule across this plane would move the atom at $(x, y, 0)$ to $(x, -y, 0)$. This would map the chlorine atom on one side of the C=C axis to a location on the other side where there is a hydrogen atom. Since Cl is not H, this is not a symmetry operation. Similarly, the $yz$-plane (perpendicular to the C=C bond) is not a mirror plane. Therefore, the molecule does not possess any vertical mirror planes. This makes option C incorrect.\n\nD. **An inversion through a center of symmetry ($i$)**: A center of inversion, $i$, is a point at the center of the molecule through which every atom can be reflected to an identical atom an equal distance on the opposite side. We placed the center of the C=C bond at the origin (0,0,0). For any atom at coordinates $(x, y, z)$, the inversion operation sends it to $(-x, -y, -z)$. In our setup, the atom at $(x, y, 0)$ is sent to $(-x, -y, 0)$. The carbon at $(a, 0, 0)$ is exchanged with the carbon at $(-a, 0, 0)$. The chlorine atom attached to one carbon is exchanged with the chlorine atom on the other carbon, and similarly for the hydrogen atoms. The molecule is mapped onto itself. Thus, a center of inversion exists at the origin. This makes option D correct.\n\nE. **A rotation about a three-fold axis of symmetry ($C_3$)**: A $C_3$ operation requires the molecule to be indistinguishable after a rotation of $360^\\circ/3 = 120^\\circ$. The geometry of *trans*-1,2-dichloroethene does not have any three-fold symmetry. A $120^\\circ$ rotation would move atoms to positions not occupied by identical atoms. This makes option E incorrect.\n\nF. **An improper rotation about a four-fold axis of symmetry ($S_4$)**: An $S_4$ operation consists of a $90^\\circ$ rotation followed by a reflection through a plane perpendicular to the rotation axis. The molecule does not have four-fold rotational symmetry, so it cannot have an $S_4$ axis. This makes option F incorrect.\n\nIn summary, the symmetry operations present in *trans*-1,2-dichloroethene from the given list are $C_2$, $\\sigma_h$, and $i$. These correspond to options A, B, and D.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{ABD}$$", "id": "2292108"}, {"introduction": "Once you are comfortable identifying individual symmetry operations, the next step is to use this collection of operations to classify a molecule into a specific point group. This practice challenges you to determine the complete set of symmetry elements for a given molecular geometry and assign the correct Schoenflies symbol [@problem_id:2292119]. This skill is crucial because a molecule's point group dictates many of its physical and spectroscopic properties, such as polarity and chirality.", "problem": "Consider a hypothetical molecule with the chemical formula $\\text{AF}_5$. The geometry of this molecule is described as follows: A central atom, A, is bonded to five fluorine atoms. Four of these fluorine atoms, denoted as $F_{base}$, are arranged to form a perfect square. The fifth fluorine atom, denoted as $F_{apical}$, is positioned along an axis that passes through the center of the square and is perpendicular to the plane containing the square. The central atom A also lies on this same axis, but it is located between the $F_{apical}$ atom and the plane of the four $F_{base}$ atoms. The bond length between atom A and each of the four $F_{base}$ atoms is identical.\n\nBased on this structural description, determine the point group for the $\\text{AF}_5$ molecule. Express your answer using the appropriate Schoenflies notation (e.g., $C_{2v}$, $D_{3h}$, etc.).", "solution": "We analyze the described geometry: a central atom $A$ bonded to five fluorine atoms with four $F_{base}$ forming a perfect square and one $F_{apical}$ along the axis perpendicular to the square. The atom $A$ lies on this axis between the $F_{apical}$ and the plane of the $F_{base}$ atoms. All $A$–$F_{base}$ bond lengths are equal.\n\n1. Identify the principal rotation axis. The axis passing through $F_{apical}$, $A$, and the center of the square is a candidate. A rotation by $90^{\\circ}$ about this axis permutes the four $F_{base}$ atoms cyclically and leaves $F_{apical}$ and $A$ unchanged. Therefore, there is a $C_{4}$ axis. Consequently, $C_{4}^{2}$ is a $C_{2}$ operation about the same axis.\n\n2. Check for vertical mirror planes $\\sigma_{v}$. Because the base is a perfect square and $A$ and $F_{apical}$ lie on the axis, any plane containing the principal axis and either (i) two opposite $F_{base}$ atoms or (ii) bisecting the angle between adjacent $F_{base}$ atoms will reflect the square onto itself while leaving $A$ and $F_{apical}$ invariant. This yields four vertical mirror planes, $\\sigma_{v}$.\n\n3. Check for a horizontal mirror plane $\\sigma_{h}$. A plane perpendicular to the principal axis through $A$ or through the base plane would map $F_{apical}$ to the opposite side where there is no fluorine atom. Hence, there is no $\\sigma_{h}$.\n\n4. Check for an inversion center $i$. Inversion through any point (e.g., at $A$ or the square’s center) would send $F_{apical}$ to a position where there is no atom. Thus, $i$ is absent.\n\n5. Check for $C_{2}$ axes perpendicular to the principal axis. Any such $C_{2}$ would interchange the apical region with the opposite, atom-free side, which is not allowed. Therefore, no perpendicular $C_{2}$ axes exist, ruling out $D_{4}$ or $D_{4h}$ types.\n\n6. Check for improper rotations $S_{4}$. An $S_{4}$ would require a $\\sigma_{h}$ to accompany $C_{4}$, which is absent. Thus, $S_{4}$ is not present.\n\nThe full set of symmetry elements is $E$, $C_{4}$, $C_{4}^{3}$, $C_{2}$ (about the principal axis), and four $\\sigma_{v}$ planes, which defines the point group $C_{4v}$, characteristic of an ideal square pyramidal geometry.\n\nTherefore, the point group is $C_{4v}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C_{4v}}$$", "id": "2292119"}, {"introduction": "The power of symmetry analysis comes from its rigorous mathematical foundation, where symmetry operations form a structure known as a group.
