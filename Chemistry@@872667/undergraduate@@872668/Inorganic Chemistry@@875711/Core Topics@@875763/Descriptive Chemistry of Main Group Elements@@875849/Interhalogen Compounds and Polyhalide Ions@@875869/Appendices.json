The central atom in both species is chlorine (Cl).\n\n**Step 1: Analyze the cation $[ClF_2]^+$**\n\nFirst, we determine the total number of valence electrons for $[ClF_2]^+$.\n- Chlorine (Group 17) contributes 7 valence electrons.\n- Each fluorine (Group 17) contributes 7 valence electrons.\n- The positive charge indicates the loss of one electron.\nTotal valence electrons = $7 (\\text{from Cl}) + 2 \\times 7 (\\text{from F}) - 1 (\\text{charge}) = 7 + 14 - 1 = 20$ valence electrons.\n\nNext, we draw the Lewis structure.

This uses $2 \\times 6 = 12$ electrons.\n- We have $16 - 12 = 4$ electrons remaining. These are placed on the central chlorine atom as 2 lone pairs.\n\nThe central chlorine atom in $[ClF_2]^+$ has 2 bonding pairs (to the F atoms) and 2 lone pairs. This gives a total of 4 electron domains.\n\nAccording to VSEPR theory, 4 electron domains arrange themselves in a **tetrahedral** electron geometry to minimize repulsion. The ideal angle in a perfect tetrahedron is $109.5^\\circ$.\n\nThe molecular geometry is determined by the positions of the atoms only. With 2 bonding pairs and 2 lone pairs, the shape is **bent** or **V-shaped**. The lone pairs exert a stronger repulsive force than bonding pairs (lone pair-lone pair > lone pair-bonding pair > bonding pair-bonding pair). These repulsions push the two Cl-F bonds closer together. Therefore, the F-Cl-F bond angle in $[ClF_2]^+$ will be significantly **less than $109.5^\\circ$**.\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the anion $[ClF_2]^-$**\n\nFirst, we determine the total number of valence electrons for $[ClF_2]^-$.\n- Chlorine (Group 17) contributes 7 valence electrons.\n- Each fluorine (Group 17) contributes 7 valence electrons.\n- The negative charge indicates the gain of one electron.\nTotal valence electrons = $7 (\\text{from Cl}) + 2 \\times 7 (\\text{from F}) + 1 (\\text{charge}) = 7 + 14 + 1 = 22$ valence electrons.\n\nNext, we draw the Lewis structure.

This gives a total of 5 electron domains.\n\nAccording to VSEPR theory, 5 electron domains arrange themselves in a **trigonal bipyramidal** electron geometry. In this arrangement, to minimize repulsion, the lone pairs occupy the positions with more space, which are the three equatorial positions. The bonding pairs are forced into the remaining two axial positions.\n\nThe molecular geometry is determined by the positions of the atoms. With the two fluorine atoms in the axial positions and the central chlorine atom between them, the molecular geometry is **linear**. The F-Cl-F bond angle is therefore **$180^\\circ$**.\n\n**Step 3: Compare the bond angles and evaluate the options.**\n\n- The F-Cl-F bond angle in $[ClF_2]^+$ is less than $109.5^\\circ$.\n- The F-Cl-F bond angle in $[ClF_2]^-$ is $180^\\circ$.\n\nTherefore, the bond angle in $[ClF_2]^-$ is significantly larger than the bond angle in $[ClF_2]^+$.\n\nNow let's evaluate the given options:\n- A is incorrect.

It correctly states that the angle in $[ClF_2]^-$ is larger and provides the correct VSEPR-based reasoning for the geometries of both ions (linear from trigonal bipyramidal for $[ClF_2]^-$ and bent from tetrahedral for $[ClF_2]^+$).\n- D is incorrect. While the angle in $[ClF_2]^-$ is larger, the reasoning provided (\"negative charge causes more repulsion\") is an oversimplification and not the precise VSEPR explanation. The key is the number of electron domains and their specific arrangement.\n- E is incorrect.

Chlorine has seven valence electrons. In $\\mathrm{ClF_{3}}$, chlorine forms three $\\mathrm{Cl\\textrm{-}F}$ bonds, using three bonding pairs, and retains two lone pairs. Therefore, the central atom has $5$ electron domains in total, which corresponds in VSEPR to an $AX_{3}E_{2}$ species.\n\nFor $5$ electron domains, the electron-domain geometry is trigonal bipyramidal. VSEPR dictates that lone pairs prefer equatorial positions in a trigonal bipyramidal arrangement to minimize repulsions, because an equatorial lone pair has two $90^{\\circ}$ interactions (with the two axial positions) and two $120^{\\circ}$ interactions (with the other equatorial positions), whereas an axial lone pair would have three $90^{\\circ}$ interactions with the equatorial positions. Since $90^{\\circ}$ interactions are more destabilizing than $120^{\\circ}$ interactions, placing lone pairs equatorial minimizes repulsion.\n\nWith two lone pairs occupying two equatorial sites, the three fluorine atoms occupy two axial positions and one equatorial position, yielding a T-shaped molecular geometry.\n\nNext, compare repulsions experienced by axial and equatorial $\\mathrm{Cl\\textrm{-}F}$ bonding pairs to rationalize bond lengths. Use the standard VSEPR repulsion hierarchy $LP\\textrm{-}LP > LP\\textrm{-}BP > BP\\textrm{-}BP$ and the fact that $90^{\\circ}$ interactions are more repulsive than $120^{\\circ}$ interactions.\n\n- Each axial $\\mathrm{Cl\\textrm{-}F}$ bond has three $90^{\\circ}$ interactions with the equatorial plane: two $LP\\textrm{-}BP$ interactions (with the two equatorial lone pairs) and one $BP\\textrm{-}BP$ interaction (with the equatorial $\\mathrm{Cl\\textrm{-}F}$ bond).\n- The equatorial $\\mathrm{Cl\\textrm{-}F}$ bond has two $90^{\\circ}$ $BP\\textrm{-}BP$ interactions (with the two axial bonds) and two $120^{\\circ}$ $LP\\textrm{-}BP$ interactions (with the two equatorial lone pairs).\n\nBecause $LP\\textrm{-}BP$ repulsions are stronger than $BP\\textrm{-}BP$ and because $90^{\\circ}$ interactions are stronger than $120^{\\circ}$ interactions, the axial bonds experience greater net repulsion (notably two $90^{\\circ}$ $LP\\textrm{-}BP$ interactions) than the equatorial bond.

Hence, the axial $\\mathrm{Cl\\textrm{-}F}$ bonds are longer than the equatorial $\\mathrm{Cl\\textrm{-}F}$ bond.\n\nEvaluate the options:\n- A: Correct.

Lone pairs do not occupy axial positions; they occupy equatorial positions in trigonal bipyramidal arrangements.\n- C: Incorrect. The electron-domain geometry is trigonal bipyramidal, not trigonal planar; the molecular geometry is T-shaped.\n- D: Incorrect.
