This exercise challenges you to look beyond the simple cyclic structure and analyze the delicate balance between competing electronic effects—induction and resonance—to predict the most reactive site for an incoming electrophile. Mastering this analysis is key to understanding why borazine's reactivity is so distinct from its organic counterpart, benzene [@problem_id:2236646].", "problem": "Borazine, an inorganic compound with the chemical formula $B_3N_3H_6$, is often referred to as \"inorganic benzene\" due to its cyclic structure, which is isoelectronic and isostructural with benzene. However, unlike the nonpolar C-C bonds in benzene, the B-N bonds in borazine are polar. This polarity arises from two competing electronic effects: the inductive effect due to the electronegativity difference between boron and nitrogen, and the mesomeric (resonance) effect involving the delocalization of nitrogen's lone pair electrons into boron's vacant p-orbital.\n\nConsidering these electronic characteristics, predict the most likely site of initial attack when borazine reacts with a strong electrophile, such as a proton ($H^+$). Your reasoning should be based on identifying the most nucleophilic atom in the borazine ring.\n\nWhich of the following statements correctly identifies the site of attack and the primary justification?\n\nA. Attack occurs at a boron atom because the mesomeric effect dominates, resulting in a net negative charge on boron.\n\nB. Attack occurs at a nitrogen atom because the inductive effect dominates, resulting in a net negative charge on nitrogen.\n\nC. Attack occurs at a boron atom because boron is less electronegative than nitrogen, making it the more basic site.\n\nD. Attack occurs at a nitrogen atom because the resonance structures place a positive formal charge on nitrogen, making it susceptible to electrophilic attack.\n\nE. Attack occurs randomly at any of the six ring atoms because the ring is fully delocalized and aromatic, similar to benzene.", "solution": "We identify the most nucleophilic site in borazine by comparing the inductive and mesomeric effects operating on the B and N atoms and by applying the principle that electrophiles attack electron-rich (nucleophilic, basic) sites.\n\n1) Inductive effect: Nitrogen is more electronegative than boron, i.e., $\\chi_{\\text{N}} > \\chi_{\\text{B}}$. Through the $\\sigma$ framework, this withdraws electron density from boron toward nitrogen, making boron electron-poor and nitrogen electron-rich. Thus, by induction, nitrogen atoms acquire greater basicity and nucleophilicity relative to boron.\n\n2) Mesomeric (resonance) effect: Nitrogen’s lone pair can delocalize into the ring, overlapping with the vacant $p$ orbitals on boron. Resonance structures can be drawn in which nitrogen bears a positive formal charge and boron bears a negative formal charge. This delocalization reduces the lone-pair availability at nitrogen and increases electron density at boron compared to a purely inductive picture.\n\n3) Net effect and reactivity: In borazine, the inductive effect due to the substantial electronegativity difference dominates the mesomeric donation in determining overall polarity. Consequently, boron centers remain electron-deficient (Lewis acidic), and nitrogen centers remain the more electron-rich, basic sites. Consistent with this, strong electrophiles such as $H^{+}$ protonate nitrogen rather than boron, and nucleophiles preferentially attack boron.\n\nTherefore, the initial attack by a strong electrophile occurs at nitrogen, justified primarily by the dominance of the inductive effect that renders nitrogen the more nucleophilic site.

This final practice presents a synthetic challenge: how to selectively prepare a monosubstituted borazine derivative. You must evaluate several proposed strategies, applying your knowledge of borazine's Lewis basicity, bond polarity, and reaction mechanisms to identify the most viable and selective synthetic route [@problem_id:2236665].", "problem": "An inorganic chemist is developing a synthetic strategy to prepare B-monoethylborazine, $(C_2H_5)B_3N_3H_5$, a key precursor for advanced ceramic materials.

Evaluate each route based on fundamental principles of reactivity in main group chemistry and select the one that is most likely to be successful in achieving a selective synthesis of B-monoethylborazine.\n\nA. A three-step route:\n(i) React boron trichloride ($BCl_3$) with ammonium chloride ($NH_4Cl$) to form B-trichloroborazine ($B_3Cl_3N_3H_3$).\n(ii) Treat the B-trichloroborazine with one molar equivalent of ethylmagnesium bromide ($C_2H_5MgBr$).\n(iii) Reduce the resulting intermediate using lithium borohydride ($LiBH_4$).\n\nB.

A ring-construction route:\nInduce the co-trimerization of a stoichiometric mixture of ethylborane ($C_2H_5BH_2$) and aminoborane ($H_2N-BH_2$) under thermolytic conditions.", "solution": "Target analysis: B-monoethylborazine, $(C_2H_5)B_3N_3H_5$, is obtained by replacing exactly one $\\text{B-H}$ unit in borazine with a $\\text{B-C}_2\\text{H}_5$ substituent while retaining the remaining two $\\text{B-H}$ and all three $\\text{N-H}$ units. Achieving high selectivity requires differentiating one boron site chemically and then restoring the other boron sites to $\\text{B-H}$ without further alkylation.\n\nPrinciples to apply:\n- Boron in borazine is electron-deficient (Lewis acidic), whereas nitrogen is Lewis basic. $\\text{N-H}$ bonds are protic (acidic) and $\\text{B-H}$ bonds are hydridic (not acidic). \n- Nucleophilic substitution at boron is strongly facilitated by a good leaving group at boron (e.g., $\\text{B-Cl}$), while direct substitution at neutral $\\text{B-H}$ in borazine is poor. \n- Strong bases such as organolithiums and Grignard reagents deprotonate $\\text{N-H}$ much more readily than they would substitute $\\text{B-H}$ in neutral borazine, unless boron bears a strong electron-withdrawing substituent (e.g., $\\text{B-Cl}$).\n- Lewis acids such as $AlCl_3$ bind tightly to nitrogen lone pairs, often deactivating or destroying the borazine ring rather than enabling controlled electrophilic aromatic substitution.\n- Hydride reagents such as $LiBH_4$ can reduce $\\text{B-Cl}$ to $\\text{B-H}$ with high chemoselectivity, generally leaving robust $\\text{B-C}$ bonds intact.\n\nRoute-by-route evaluation:\n\nA. Sequence: (i) $BCl_3 + \\text{NH}_4\\text{Cl}$ to form $B_3Cl_3N_3H_3$; (ii) 1 equiv $C_2H_5MgBr$; (iii) $LiBH_4$ reduction.\n- Step (i) is a known strategy: forming a borazine with three $\\text{B-Cl}$ and three $\\text{N-H}$ groups via condensation of a boron trihalide with an ammonia source. This furnishes an activated borazine in which boron centers are strongly electrophilic due to $\\text{B-Cl}$.\n- Step (ii) uses exactly one equivalent of a nucleophilic $C_2H_5$ source ($C_2H_5MgBr$). Because only boron atoms bearing $\\text{B-Cl}$ are activated toward nucleophilic substitution, the Grignard reagent will substitute one $\\text{B-Cl}$ with $\\text{B-C}_2\\text{H}_5$ to give a monoethyl dichloro borazine, while the limited stoichiometry prevents overalkylation.\n- Potential competition with $\\text{N-H}$ deprotonation is mitigated by the much higher electrophilicity of $\\text{B-Cl}$ and by controlling reaction conditions; furthermore, substitution at $\\text{B-Cl}$ is kinetically and thermodynamically favored over reaction at neutral $\\text{B-H}$ or $\\text{N-H}$ for the first equivalent of Grignard.\n- Step (iii) employs $LiBH_4$ to convert the two remaining $\\text{B-Cl}$ groups into $\\text{B-H}$ via hydride transfer to boron, generating the desired $\\text{B-H}$ bonds. The $\\text{B-C}$ bond is resilient toward $LiBH_4$, so the ethyl group remains intact. This sequence provides a chemoselective and stoichiometrically controlled path to B-monoethylborazine.\n\nB. One-step reaction of $B_3N_3H_6$ with 1 equiv $C_2H_5MgBr$.\n- Neutral borazine lacks a leaving group at boron; direct $\\text{B-H}$ to $\\text{B-C}$ substitution is disfavored. Grignard reagents will likely deprotonate $\\text{N-H}$ groups, form adducts with boron, and induce multiple reactions once the ring is activated, yielding mixtures that include polyalkylated products and deprotonated N-species. With no intrinsic control element, selectivity for mono-B-ethylation is poor.\n\nC. Friedel-Crafts-type ethylation with $C_2H_5Cl / AlCl_3$.\n- Borazine is not a hydrocarbon arene; $AlCl_3$ forms strong adducts with ring nitrogens, deactivating or decomposing the ring. Electrophilic aromatic substitution analogies do not hold; side reactions such as N-complexation, cleavage, and polymerization dominate. This route is not selective and is likely destructive.\n\nD. $n\\text{-BuLi}$ deprotonation (3 equiv) followed by 1 equiv $C_2H_5I$.\n- $n\\text{-BuLi}$ deprotonates the three $\\text{N-H}$ sites (protic), not the hydridic $\\text{B-H}$ sites. The resulting trianion is localized at nitrogen atoms and reacts with $C_2H_5I$ to give N-ethylation, not B-ethylation. Moreover, with three nucleophilic sites and only one equivalent of electrophile, this produces statistical mixtures and not a selective B-monoethyl product.\n\nE. Co-trimerization of $C_2H_5BH_2$ with $H_2N-BH_2$.\n- Borazine rings form via trimerization of aminoborane units, but mixing different monomers yields statistical incorporation, generating distributions of mono-, di-, and tri-ethylborazines. Given the lack of kinetic or thermodynamic control favoring exactly one ethyl substituent, selectivity is intrinsically poor. Practical complications include the instability and aggregation of alkylboranes under thermolysis.\n\nConclusion: Only Route A introduces an explicit, chemoselective handle ($\\text{B-Cl}$) allowing controlled mono-introduction of $C_2H_5$ by stoichiometric limitation, followed by a selective reduction ($\\text{B-Cl}$ to $\\text{B-H}$) that preserves the $\\text{B-C}$ bond. This matches the stated goal of maximizing the B-monoethylborazine while minimizing di-, tri-substitution, and unreacted starting material.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2236665"}]}
