In square planar $d^{8}$ Pt(II) complexes, ligand substitution proceeds via an associative interchange mechanism, and the trans effect controls which site is substituted: a ligand with a stronger trans effect labilizes the ligand trans to it, so the incoming ligand preferentially occupies the position trans to the ligand with the strongest trans effect already bound.\n\nStep 1 (addition of exactly one equivalent of $Cl^{-}$): Because only one aqua ligand is to be substituted and substitution goes to completion, one $H_{2}O$ is replaced by $Cl^{-}$ to give the monochloro aquo complex:\n$$\n[\\text{Pt}(\\text{H}_{2}\\text{O})_{4}]^{2+} + \\text{Cl}^{-} \\longrightarrow [\\text{Pt}(\\text{H}_{2}\\text{O})_{3}\\text{Cl}]^{+} + \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}.\n$$\nAt this stage, there is no cis/trans issue because only one non-aqua ligand is present.\n\nStep 2 (addition of exactly one equivalent of $CN^{-}$): Cyanide will substitute one $H_{2}O$ from $[\\text{Pt}(\\text{H}_{2}\\text{O})_{3}\\text{Cl}]^{+}$. The site selected is governed by the trans effect. The qualitative trans-effect series places $Cl^{-}$ above $H_{2}O$ (i.e., $Cl^{-}$ has a stronger trans effect than $H_{2}O$), while $CN^{-}$ is even stronger but is not yet coordinated during the site-determining step. Therefore, the $H_{2}O$ ligand trans to $Cl^{-}$ is labilized and is the one that departs, causing the incoming $CN^{-}$ to bind trans to $Cl^{-}$:\n$$\n[\\text{Pt}(\\text{H}_{2}\\text{O})_{3}\\text{Cl}]^{+} + \\text{CN}^{-} \\longrightarrow [\\text{Pt}(\\text{H}_{2}\\text{O})_{2}(\\text{CN})\\text{Cl}] + \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O},\n$$\nwith $CN^{-}$ trans to $Cl^{-}$. The product thus has $CN^{-}$ and $Cl^{-}$ in a trans relationship, i.e., the trans isomer.\n\nCharge check: $Pt^{2+}$ with two neutral $H_{2}O$ ligands and two anionic ligands $Cl^{-}$ and $CN^{-}$ gives an overall neutral complex, consistent with $[\\text{Pt}(\\text{H}_{2}\\text{O})_{2}(\\text{CN})\\text{Cl}]$.\n\nEliminations: $[\\text{Pt}(\\text{H}_{2}\\text{O})_{3}\\text{CN}]^{+}$ corresponds to only one substitution, contrary to the two-step sequence. $[\\text{Pt}(\\text{H}_{2}\\text{O})\\text{Cl}_{2}(\\text{CN})]^{-}$ would require two $Cl^{-}$ substitutions, which is impossible with only one equivalent of $Cl^{-}$ and also violates the “only aqua ligands are substituted” instruction. A nearly equimolar cis/trans mixture is not expected under trans-effect control with stepwise addition; the strong trans-directing $Cl^{-}$ present in step 2 directs $CN^{-}$ to the trans position, yielding predominantly the trans isomer.\n\nTherefore, the major final product is *trans*-$[\\text{Pt}(\\text{H}_{2}\\text{O})_{2}(\\text{CN})\\text{Cl}]$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2265730"}, {"introduction": "Beyond guiding synthesis, the trans effect also governs the kinetic lability—the ease of replacement—of ligands already present in a complex.
