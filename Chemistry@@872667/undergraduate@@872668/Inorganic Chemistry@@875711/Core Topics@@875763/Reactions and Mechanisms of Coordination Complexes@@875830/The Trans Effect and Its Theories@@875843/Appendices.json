The stereochemistry of substitution reactions in square planar complexes like those of Pt(II) is known to be governed by the trans effect, where a ligand increases the rate of substitution of the ligand positioned opposite (trans) to it.\n\nFor the purpose of this problem, assume the following abbreviated trans-directing series, ordered from strongest to weakest director:\n$\\text{CN}^{-} > \\text{NO}_{2}^{-} > \\text{I}^{-} > \\text{Br}^{-} > \\text{Cl}^{-} > \\text{py} > \\text{NH}_{3} > \\text{H}_{2}\\text{O}$\n\nBased on this information, which of the following statements most accurately describes the expected major product of this reaction?\n\nA.
