A common example is an aquation reaction, where a ligand is replaced by a water molecule. Consider the series of octahedral cobalt(III) complexes: $[Co(NH_3)_5X]^{2+}$, where the ligand $X$ is a halide ion ($F^-$, $Cl^-$, $Br^-$, or $I^-$).\n\nThe aquation reaction for these complexes is:\n$$[Co(NH_3)_5X]^{2+}(aq) + H_2O(l) \\rightarrow [Co(NH_3)_5(H_2O)]^{3+}(aq) + X^-(aq)$$\n\nLet $k_F$, $k_{Cl}$, $k_{Br}$, and $k_I$ represent the second-order rate constants for the aquation of $[Co(NH_3)_5F]^{2+}$, $[Co(NH_3)_5Cl]^{2+}$, $[Co(NH_3)_5Br]^{2+}$, and $[Co(NH_3)_5I]^{2+}$, respectively, under identical conditions.

Cobalt(III) in such ammine complexes is a low-spin $d^{6}$, highly charged, kinetically inert center, for which ligand substitution commonly proceeds by a dissociative or dissociative interchange pathway. In such mechanisms, the rate-determining step is predominantly the partial or complete cleavage of the metal–leaving-group bond, so the rate correlates inversely with the metal–ligand bond strength.\n\nFor the aquation reaction\n$$[Co(NH_{3})_{5}X]^{2+} + H_{2}O \\rightarrow [Co(NH_{3})_{5}(H_{2}O)]^{3+} + X^{-},$$\nthe halide $X^{-}$ acts as the leaving group.

By analyzing their electronic structures, you will uncover why their reaction rates and preferred mechanisms differ so dramatically, highlighting the profound impact of the 18-electron rule on chemical reactivity.", "problem": "Two inorganic chemists are discussing the kinetics of ligand substitution reactions. They are comparing the substitution of a single carbonyl (CO) ligand by a triphenylphosphine ($PPh_3$) ligand in two different octahedral metal carbonyl complexes: hexacarbonyltungsten(0), $[W(CO)_6]$, and the radical complex hexacarbonylvanadium(0), $[V(CO)_6]$. They observe that one of these reactions is drastically faster than the other, by many orders of magnitude. For the purpose of electron counting, consider tungsten (W) to be in Group 6 and vanadium (V) to be in Group 5 of the periodic table. Assume that both CO and $PPh_3$ act as neutral, two-electron donor ligands.\n\nWhich of the following statements provides the most accurate and fundamental explanation for the observed difference in substitution rates?\n\nA. The reaction is much faster for $[V(CO)_6]$. As a 17-electron complex, it readily undergoes substitution via a low-energy associative pathway, as the formation of a 19-electron intermediate/transition state is highly favorable compared to the alternatives.\n\nB. The reaction is much faster for $[W(CO)_6]$. Tungsten is a third-row transition metal, which forms weaker M-CO bonds compared to first-row metals like vanadium. This facilitates a rapid dissociative mechanism where a CO ligand is easily lost.\n\nC. The reaction is much faster for $[V(CO)_6]$. As a 17-electron complex, it readily loses a CO ligand in a dissociative mechanism to form a stable, 15-electron intermediate, which then rapidly adds the new ligand.\n\nD. Both complexes react at very similar rates. Since both are octahedral complexes and the incoming ligand is the same, the identity of the central metal atom does not significantly influence the activation energy for substitution.\n\nE. The reaction is much faster for $[W(CO)_6]$. Although it is an 18-electron complex, its large atomic radius allows for a low-energy associative pathway by easily accommodating a seventh ligand in the transition state.", "solution": "We first count electrons for each complex using the neutral electron-counting method and the given group assignments, treating both CO and $PPh_{3}$ as neutral two-electron donors.\n\nFor $[W(CO)_{6}]$:\n- Tungsten is in Group $6$, so $W(0)$ contributes $6$ electrons.\n- Six CO ligands contribute $6 \\times 2 = 12$ electrons.\n- Total electron count: $6 + 12 = 18$ electrons.\n\nFor $[V(CO)_{6}]$:\n- Vanadium is in Group $5$, so $V(0)$ contributes $5$ electrons.\n- Six CO ligands contribute $12$ electrons.\n- Total electron count: $5 + 12 = 17$ electrons.\n\nNext, we apply the 18-electron rule and substitution mechanism preferences:\n- An $18$-electron, octahedral complex like $[W(CO)_{6}]$ is coordinatively saturated. An associative substitution would formally require passing through a species with $18 + 2 = 20$ electrons, which is strongly disfavored due to electronic overcrowding and lack of low-lying acceptor orbitals. Therefore, $[W(CO)_{6}]$ typically substitutes via a dissociative mechanism in which a CO first dissociates to generate a $16$-electron intermediate; this CO loss is rate-determining and is typically slow. Moreover, for a heavy $5d$ metal like tungsten, strong $M$–CO bonding and strong backbonding tend to make CO dissociation relatively slow, further diminishing the rate.\n\n- A $17$-electron complex like $[V(CO)_{6}]$ is coordinatively unsaturated and has a singly occupied molecular orbital. Such odd-electron, unsaturated complexes commonly undergo very rapid associative ligand addition because the approach of a donor ligand can be stabilized by interaction with the singly occupied orbital. While a purely formal electron count would label the immediate adduct or transition state as $19$ electrons, the key point is that the associative pathway is much less energetically penalized than for an $18$-electron complex attempting to reach $20$ electrons. In practice, the incoming $2$-electron donor binds readily (very low barrier), and any subsequent CO loss (to reach an $18$-electron product) is fast. Thus, $[V(CO)_{6}]$ undergoes substitution drastically faster than $[W(CO)_{6}]$.\n\nNow we evaluate the options:\n\n- A states the reaction is much faster for $[V(CO)_{6}]$ and attributes it to an associative pathway accessible to the $17$-electron complex. Although describing the $19$-electron intermediate/transition state as \"highly favorable\" is an overstatement, this option correctly identifies both the faster complex and the associative character of the pathway for the odd-electron species. It is the most accurate among the choices.\n\n- B incorrectly asserts faster substitution for $[W(CO)_{6}]$ and incorrectly claims weaker $M$–CO bonds for tungsten versus a first-row metal; it also incorrectly favors a rapid dissociative pathway for $[W(CO)_{6}]$.\n\n- C incorrectly proposes a dissociative mechanism for $[V(CO)_{6}]$ generating a stable $15$-electron intermediate; such a $15$-electron species would be highly unstable, making this mechanism implausible as the rate-determining step.\n\n- D is incorrect because metal identity and electron count strongly influence substitution rates and mechanisms.\n\n- E incorrectly proposes an associative pathway for the $18$-electron $[W(CO)_{6}]$ by invoking size alone; passing to a formal $20$-electron transition state is strongly disfavored.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statement is A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "2265997"}]}
