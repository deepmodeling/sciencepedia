By analyzing the final location of a $^{13}C$ label, you can deduce whether ligands are exchanged between metal centers, providing direct evidence for or against an outer-sphere pathway and reinforcing the mechanism's defining feature: the integrity of the reactants' coordination spheres.", "problem": "In coordination chemistry, electron transfer reactions between metal complexes can proceed through two primary mechanisms: inner-sphere and outer-sphere. An outer-sphere mechanism is characterized by electron transfer between two complexes whose inner coordination spheres remain intact.\n\nConsider the rapid electron transfer reaction between hexacyanoferrate(II), $[Fe(CN)_6]^{4-}$, and hexaammineruthenium(III), $[Ru(NH_3)_6]^{3+}$, in an aqueous solution. To investigate the mechanism, an experiment is performed using an isotopically labeled version of the reductant. Specifically, the hexacyanoferrate(II) is synthesized such that its cyanide ligands are enriched with the carbon-13 isotope ($^{13}C$), while the natural abundance of $^{13}C$ is negligible in all other reagents. The reaction is initiated by mixing the labeled $[Fe(^{13}CN)_6]^{4-}$ with $[Ru(NH_3)_6]^{3+}$. After the reaction is complete, the product mixture is separated into its constituent complexes, which are then analyzed to determine the location of the $^{13}C$ label.\n\nWhich of the following experimental outcomes would be consistent with the reaction proceeding exclusively through an outer-sphere electron transfer mechanism?\n\nA. The $^{13}C$ label is found distributed between the product $[Fe(CN)_6]^{3-}$ and a newly formed complex, $[Ru(NH_3)_5(CN)]^{+}$.\n\nB. The $^{13}C$ label is found exclusively as free $^{13}CN^{-}$ ions in the solution.\n\nC. The $^{13}C$ label is found exclusively in the product hexaammineruthenium(II) complex, $[Ru(NH_3)_6]^{2+}$.\n\nD. The $^{13}C$ label is found exclusively in the product hexacyanoferrate(III) complex, $[Fe(^{13}CN)_6]^{3-}$.\n\nE. The $^{13}C$ label is found to be equally distributed between the product $[Fe(^{13}CN)_6]^{3-}$ and the product $[Ru(NH_3)_6]^{2+}$.", "solution": "We analyze the mechanism and isotopic-label outcome using the defining principle of outer-sphere electron transfer: electron transfer occurs without any change to the inner coordination spheres of either complex. This implies no ligand substitution, no ligand bridging that results in ligand transfer, and no bond-making or bond-breaking within the primary coordination shells during the electron transfer step.\n\nThe reactants are labeled hexacyanoferrate(II), $[Fe(^{13}CN)_{6}]^{4-}$, and unlabeled hexaammineruthenium(III), $[Ru(NH_{3})_{6}]^{3+}$. In a purely outer-sphere mechanism, after electron transfer, the oxidation states change but the ligands remain bound to their original metal centers. Thus the products must be $[Fe(^{13}CN)_{6}]^{3-}$ (oxidized iron complex retaining all labeled cyanides) and $[Ru(NH_{3})_{6}]^{2+}$ (reduced ruthenium complex retaining all ammines and acquiring no label). Therefore, the $^{13}C$ label must remain exclusively with the iron complex in the product mixture.\n\nWe evaluate each option against this criterion:\n- Option A proposes detection of the $^{13}C$ in both $[Fe(CN)_{6}]^{3-}$ and $[Ru(NH_{3})_{5}(CN)]^{+}$. Formation of $[Ru(NH_{3})_{5}(CN)]^{+}$ requires transfer of a cyanide ligand from Fe to Ru via a bridging CN, which is characteristic of an inner-sphere pathway. This contradicts an exclusively outer-sphere mechanism.\n- Option B proposes free $^{13}CN^{-}$ in solution. Free cyanide arising from the labeled complex indicates ligand dissociation or exchange, incompatible with a strictly outer-sphere process that preserves the inner sphere.\n- Option C proposes the $^{13}C$ label exclusively in $[Ru(NH_{3})_{6}]^{2+}$. This complex has only NH3 ligands and contains no carbon; incorporation of the $^{13}C$ label would imply ligand transfer or chemical transformation, which cannot occur in a purely outer-sphere mechanism.\n- Option D proposes the $^{13}C$ label exclusively in $[Fe(^{13}CN)_{6}]^{3-}$. This matches the outer-sphere requirement: only electron transfer occurs; all original ligands (including the labeled cyanides) remain on Fe.\n- Option E proposes equal distribution of the $^{13}C$ label between $[Fe(^{13}CN)_{6}]^{3-}$ and $[Ru(NH_{3})_{6}]^{2+}$. As with Option C, $[Ru(NH_{3})_{6}]^{2+}$ has no CN ligands, so this requires ligand transfer or other chemical change, contradicting a pure outer-sphere pathway.\n\nTherefore, only Option D is consistent with an exclusively outer-sphere electron transfer mechanism.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{D}$$", "id": "2276454"}, {"introduction": "Once a reaction mechanism is identified, a crucial next step is to assess its thermodynamic feasibility.
