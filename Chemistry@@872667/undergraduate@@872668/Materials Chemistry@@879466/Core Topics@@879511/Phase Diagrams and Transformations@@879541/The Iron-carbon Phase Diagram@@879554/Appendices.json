The eutectic reaction is an invariant reaction where a liquid phase transforms into two solid phases upon cooling. The general form is $L \\rightarrow S_1 + S_2$. For the iron-carbon system, this specific reaction occurs at the eutectic temperature, $T_E = 1147^\\circ\\text{C}$, and the eutectic composition, 4.3 wt% C.\nThe reaction is:\n$$L(4.3 \\text{ wt\\% C}) \\xrightarrow{1147^\\circ\\text{C}} \\gamma(2.14 \\text{ wt\\% C}) + \\text{Fe}_3\\text{C}(6.7 \\text{ wt\\% C})$$\nThe parent phase is the phase that exists immediately before the transformation. For Alloy A, as it is cooled down to just above $1147^\\circ\\text{C}$, it remains entirely in the liquid phase. At exactly $1147^\\circ\\text{C}$, this liquid transforms. Therefore, the parent phase is liquid.\nThe microconstituent formed by this eutectic reaction is defined in the problem as Ledeburite, which is a mixture of austenite ($\\gamma$) and cementite (Fe$_3$C).\nSo, for Alloy A: Parent phase = Liquid; Resulting microconstituent = Ledeburite.\n\nNext, let's analyze **Alloy B**, which has the eutectoid composition of 0.76 wt% carbon.\nThis alloy is also cooled from a high temperature. As it cools, it first solidifies completely into a single solid phase, austenite ($\\gamma$). The eutectoid reaction is a solid-state invariant reaction where one solid phase transforms into two different solid phases upon cooling. The general form is $S_1 \\rightarrow S_2 + S_3$. For the iron-carbon system, this occurs at the eutectoid temperature, $T_{eutectoid} = 727^\\circ\\text{C}$, and the eutectoid composition, 0.76 wt% C.\nAs Alloy B cools and passes into the austenite phase field, it remains a single-phase austenite solid. When its temperature reaches just above $727^\\circ\\text{C}$, it is still 100% austenite. At exactly $727^\\circ\\text{C}$, this austenite transforms.\nThe reaction is:\n$$\\gamma(0.76 \\text{ wt\\% C}) \\xrightarrow{727^\\circ\\text{C}} \\alpha(0.022 \\text{ wt\\% C}) + \\text{Fe}_3\\text{C}(6.7 \\text{ wt\\% C})$$\nThe parent phase for this transformation is the solid phase that exists just before the reaction, which is austenite.\nThe microconstituent formed by this eutectoid reaction is a fine, lamellar mixture of ferrite ($\\alpha$) and cementite (Fe$_3$C), which is defined as Pearlite.\nSo, for Alloy B: Parent phase = Austenite; Resulting microconstituent = Pearlite.\n\nNow we compare our findings with the given options:\n-   **A. Alloy A: Parent phase is liquid; resulting microconstituent is Ledeburite. Alloy B: Parent phase is Austenite; resulting microconstituent is Pearlite.** This matches our analysis perfectly.\n-   B. This option incorrectly swaps the microconstituents. Pearlite is the eutectoid product, and Ledeburite is the eutectic product.\n-   C. This option incorrectly swaps the parent phases. The eutectic reaction involves a liquid parent, and the eutectoid reaction involves a solid parent (austenite).\n-   D. This option incorrectly identifies the parent phase for Alloy A. For a eutectic composition, there is only one parent phase (liquid). Two phases (liquid + solid) would be present just above the eutectic temperature for hypereutectic or hypoeutectic compositions, but not for the eutectic itself.\n-   E. This option incorrectly identifies the parent phase for Alloy B. For the eutectoid composition, the parent is single-phase austenite. Two phases (austenite + ferrite) would be present for a hypoeutectoid composition just above the eutectoid temperature.\n\nTherefore, the only correct statement is option A.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{A}$$", "id": "1341275"}, {"introduction": "The lever rule is a powerful tool not just for predicting microstructures, but also for reverse-engineering an alloy's composition.

It is scientifically grounded in the principles of physical metallurgy, specifically the iron-carbon phase diagram, and is well-posed with sufficient information for a unique solution. We shall proceed with the derivation from first principles.\n\nThe task is to determine the mass fractions of the ferrite ($\\alpha$) and cementite ($\\theta$) phases within the pearlite microconstituent formed from an austenite of eutectoid composition. This is a classic application of the lever rule, which is itself a direct consequence of the principle of conservation of mass.\n\nLet us consider a total mass $M_{total}$ of an iron-carbon alloy of eutectoid composition, $C_{0} = 0.76\\,\\mathrm{wt}\\%\\,\\mathrm{C}$. At a temperature just below the eutectoid temperature of $T_E = 727\\,^{\\circ}\\mathrm{C}$, the austenite phase ($\\gamma$) has completely transformed into a two-phase mixture of ferrite ($\\alpha$) and cementite ($\\theta$).

The total mass of carbon in the alloy is the product of the overall carbon concentration, $C_{0}$, and the total mass, $M_{total}$. This total carbon mass must be distributed between the ferrite and cementite phases.\nThe mass of carbon in the ferrite phase is $C_{\\alpha} M_{\\alpha}$, where $C_{\\alpha}$ is the carbon concentration in ferrite.\nThe mass of carbon in the cementite phase is $C_{\\theta} M_{\\theta}$, where $C_{\\theta}$ is the carbon concentration in cementite.\n\nThe carbon mass balance equation is thus:\n$$C_{0} M_{total} = C_{\\alpha} M_{\\alpha} + C_{\\theta} M_{\\theta}$$\nDividing this equation by $M_{total}$ expresses the balance in terms of mass fractions:\n$$C_{0} = C_{\\alpha} f_{\\alpha} + C_{\\theta} f_{\\theta}$$\nThis is our second governing equation.\n\nWe now have a system of two linear equations with two unknowns, $f_{\\alpha}$ and $f_{\\theta}$:\n$$f_{\\alpha} + f_{\\theta} = 1 \\quad \\quad (1)$$\n$$C_{\\alpha} f_{\\alpha} + C_{\\theta} f_{\\theta} = C_{0} \\quad \\quad (2)$$\n\nTo solve for the mass fraction of ferrite, $f_{\\alpha}$, we rearrange equation $(1)$ to express $f_{\\theta}$ in terms of $f_{\\alpha}$: $f_{\\theta} = 1 - f_{\\alpha}$.
