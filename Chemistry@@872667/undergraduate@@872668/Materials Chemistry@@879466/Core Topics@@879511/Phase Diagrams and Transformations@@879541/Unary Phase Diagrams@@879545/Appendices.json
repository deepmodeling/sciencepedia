The process occurs at constant pressure $P=0.25 \\text{ atm}$, with temperature increased from $T_{i}=150 \\text{ K}$ to $T_{f}=400 \\text{ K}$.\n\nThe relevant thermodynamic principle from the phase diagram is: the liquid phase is thermodynamically stable only for pressures $P \\geq P_{t}$. For $P<P_{t}$, the liquid phase does not exist; the only possible phase transition upon heating a solid is sublimation along the solid–gas equilibrium curve. This follows from the topology of a single-component $P$–$T$ phase diagram, where the solid–liquid coexistence line terminates at the triple point, and below $P_{t}$ there is no path that reaches the liquid region.\n\nApply this to the given path:\n1. Initial state: $P=0.25 \\text{ atm}$ and $T=150 \\text{ K}$ with $P=0.25 \\text{ atm}<P_{t}=0.40 \\text{ atm}$ and $T<T_{t}$. At low $T$ the solid is the stable phase, so the sample starts as a solid.\n2. Heating at fixed $P=0.25 \\text{ atm}$: because $P<P_{t}$, there is no liquid stability at any $T$, so the path cannot cross a solid–liquid boundary. Instead, as $T$ increases, the system reaches the solid–gas coexistence curve at some sublimation temperature $T_{\\text{sub}}(P)$, at which the solid sublimates directly to gas. No melting occurs at this pressure.\n3. For $T>T_{\\text{sub}}(0.25 \\text{ atm})$, the gas is the stable phase, and continued heating to $T_{f}=400 \\text{ K}$ leaves the system in the gas phase. There is no boiling because boiling is a liquid–gas transition and no liquid exists at $P<P_{t}$.\n\nThe given normal melting and boiling points at $P=1.00 \\text{ atm}>P_{t}$ confirm that a liquid region exists at higher pressures, but they do not alter the conclusion for $P=0.25 \\text{ atm}<P_{t}$.\n\nTherefore, the correct description is that the substance sublimates directly from solid to gas upon heating at $P=0.25 \\text{ atm}$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1345965"}, {"introduction": "Building on the basics, we now trace a complete journey across the phase diagram at constant pressure.
