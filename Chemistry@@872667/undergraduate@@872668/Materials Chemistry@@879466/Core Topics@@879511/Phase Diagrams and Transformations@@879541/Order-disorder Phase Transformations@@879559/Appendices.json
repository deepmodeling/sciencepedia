At low temperatures, energy minimization favors a perfectly ordered arrangement of atoms. As temperature rises, the system's tendency to maximize its entropy—its number of possible microscopic arrangements—begins to dominate. This exercise provides a quantitative look at this entropic driving force by having you calculate the change in configurational entropy when an alloy transitions from a random, disordered state to a perfectly ordered one, solidifying a key concept from statistical mechanics [@problem_id:1770176].", "problem": "Consider a binary alloy with an equal number of A and B atoms.

The specific heat capacity, $C_p$, which measures the energy required to raise the material's temperature, is particularly sensitive to order-disorder phenomena. This practice asks you to consider the qualitative behavior of $C_p$ during a continuous (second-order) transition, helping you understand the classic \"lambda anomaly\" that signals the peak of atomic reordering at the critical temperature [@problem_id:1320096].", "problem": "In materials science, many binary alloys exhibit an order-disorder phase transformation. Consider a hypothetical stoichiometric binary alloy, AB, that exists in a perfectly ordered crystalline structure at low temperatures. In this ordered state, A atoms occupy one set of lattice sites and B atoms occupy another. As the temperature is increased, thermal energy introduces disorder, where A and B atoms begin to swap lattice sites. Above a specific critical temperature, $T_c$, the arrangement of atoms on the lattice becomes completely random, and the alloy is in a fully disordered state. This transformation is a classic example of a continuous, or second-order, phase transition.\n\nThe specific heat capacity at constant pressure, $C_p$, provides crucial information about such transitions. It measures the energy required to raise the temperature of the material, which includes the energy absorbed to create this atomic-scale disorder.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately describes the behavior of the specific heat capacity, $C_p$, as a function of temperature, $T$, as the alloy is heated through its second-order order-disorder transition at the critical temperature $T_c$?\n\nA. $C_p$ remains constant until the temperature reaches $T_c$, at which point it displays a sharp, infinitely narrow spike (a delta-function singularity), and then returns to its original constant value.\n\nB. $C_p$ increases gradually with temperature and exhibits a finite, discontinuous jump to a higher value exactly at $T_c$, after which it slowly decreases.\n\nC. $C_p$ gradually increases as temperature approaches $T_c$ from below, peaks in a sharp, cusp-like feature (a \"lambda\" shape) at $T_c$, and then drops abruptly for temperatures just above $T_c$.\n\nD. $C_p$ is a smooth, continuous function of temperature with a broad maximum centered at $T_c$, showing no sharp features or discontinuities.\n\nE. $C_p$ decreases monotonically with increasing temperature, as the system becomes more disordered and requires less energy to disorder further.", "solution": "We begin by recalling thermodynamic definitions and what distinguishes first- and second-order phase transitions. The specific heat at constant pressure is\n$$\nC_{p} \\equiv \\left(\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial T}\\right)_{p} = T\\left(\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial T}\\right)_{p} = -T\\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2} G}{\\partial T^{2}}\\right)_{p},\n$$\nwhere $H$ is enthalpy, $S$ is entropy, and $G$ is the Gibbs free energy.\n\nAt a first-order transition, the entropy has a discontinuity $\\Delta S \\neq 0$ at the transition temperature, corresponding to a latent heat $L = T \\Delta S$. Because $S$ jumps discontinuously, the derivative $\\left(\\partial S/\\partial T\\right)_{p}$ contains a delta-function contribution at the transition, which implies a delta-function singularity in $C_{p}$. Therefore, a delta-function spike in $C_{p}$ is the hallmark of a first-order transition and not a continuous (second-order) one. This directly rules out option A for a second-order transition.\n\nAt a continuous (second-order) transition, the thermodynamic definition is that first derivatives of $G$ with respect to its natural variables (such as $S = -(\\partial G/\\partial T)_{p}$) remain continuous at $T_{c}$. Hence there is no latent heat and no delta-function singularity in $C_{p}$. However, the second derivatives of $G$ (such as $C_{p} = -T\\partial^{2}G/\\partial T^{2}$) generally exhibit a nonanalytic singularity at $T_{c}$, which can be either a finite jump discontinuity or a divergence characterized by a critical exponent. Thus, $C_{p}$ typically shows a sharp anomaly at $T_{c}$ for a second-order transition.\n\nTo make this explicit, consider a standard Landau expansion for an order-disorder transition with an order parameter $\\eta$ (e.g., the sublattice order):\n$$\nf(T,\\eta) = f_{0}(T) + a\\,(T - T_{c})\\,\\eta^{2} + b\\,\\eta^{4} + \\dots,\n$$\nwith $a>0$ and $b>0$. Minimizing with respect to $\\eta$ yields\n$$\n\\eta = 0 \\quad \\text{for} \\quad T \\geq T_{c}, \\qquad \\eta^{2} = \\frac{a\\,(T_{c}-T)}{2b} \\quad \\text{for} \\quad T < T_{c}.\n$$\nSubstituting back gives the equilibrium free energy density\n$$\nf_{\\ast}(T) =\n\\begin{cases}\nf_{0}(T), & T \\geq T_{c},\\\\\nf_{0}(T) - \\dfrac{a^{2}}{4b}\\,(T_{c}-T)^{2}, & T < T_{c}.\n\\end{cases}\n$$\nThe specific heat at constant pressure (up to replacing $f$ by the appropriate Gibbs free energy density; the singular part is the same) follows from\n$$\nC_{p} = -T\\frac{\\partial^{2} f_{\\ast}}{\\partial T^{2}}.\n$$\nDifferentiating the singular piece for $T<T_{c}$,\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial f_{\\ast}}{\\partial T} = \\frac{\\partial f_{0}}{\\partial T} + \\frac{a^{2}}{2b}(T_{c}-T), \\quad\n\\frac{\\partial^{2} f_{\\ast}}{\\partial T^{2}} = \\frac{\\partial^{2} f_{0}}{\\partial T^{2}} - \\frac{a^{2}}{2b},\n$$\nwhile for $T\\geq T_{c}$,\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^{2} f_{\\ast}}{\\partial T^{2}} = \\frac{\\partial^{2} f_{0}}{\\partial T^{2}}.\n$$\nTherefore the Landau (mean-field) prediction is a finite jump in $C_{p}$ at $T_{c}$:\n$$\n\\Delta C_{p} = C_{p}(T_{c}^{-}) - C_{p}(T_{c}^{+}) = T_{c}\\,\\frac{a^{2}}{2b}.\n$$\nThis shows that a finite discontinuous jump at $T_{c}$ is permitted for a second-order transition, consistent with option B in mean-field theory.\n\nHowever, critical fluctuations modify the mean-field result. For systems in the Ising universality class (appropriate for many binary order-disorder transitions), the specific heat near $T_{c}$ exhibits critical behavior\n$$\nC_{p}(T) \\sim A_{\\pm}\\,|t|^{-\\alpha} + B_{\\pm}, \\qquad t \\equiv \\frac{T - T_{c}}{T_{c}},\n$$\nwith a small positive critical exponent $\\alpha$ in three dimensions and distinct amplitudes $A_{+}$ and $A_{-}$ above and below $T_{c}$. This implies a sharp, cusp-like singularity (often called a lambda anomaly) at $T_{c}$, rather than a purely smooth broad maximum. In the thermodynamic limit this is a nonanalytic peak, often diverging weakly; in finite samples or with rounding, it appears as a sharp cusp. The entropy remains continuous (no latent heat), but the second derivative is singular, as required for a continuous transition.\n\nTherefore:\n- A delta-function spike (option A) corresponds to latent heat and is characteristic of a first-order transition, not applicable here.\n- A smooth, broad, featureless maximum (option D) contradicts the expected critical singularity at $T_{c}$.\n- A monotonic decrease (option E) does not capture the critical anomaly.\n- A finite jump (option B) is a mean-field possibility but misses the commonly observed sharp lambda-like anomaly due to fluctuations in real materials.\n- A sharp cusp-like peak at $T_{c}$ with $C_{p}$ increasing toward $T_{c}$ from below and then decreasing above $T_{c}$ (option C) matches the expected nonanalytic behavior (lambda anomaly) for a continuous order-disorder transition.\n\nHence, the most accurate description among the provided options for a second-order order-disorder transition in a binary alloy is the sharp, cusp-like (lambda) anomaly at $T_{c}$ with continuous entropy and no delta spike, as described in option C.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{C}$$", "id": "1320096"}, {"introduction": "While thermodynamic properties provide evidence of a transition, how do we experimentally confirm the change in atomic arrangement?
