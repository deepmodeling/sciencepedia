To minimize energy dissipation via magnetic hysteresis, the core material must be magnetically \"soft,\" meaning it should be easy to magnetize and demagnetize. The team is considering a specific iron-boron-silicon (Fe-B-Si) ferromagnetic alloy. They can produce this alloy in two distinct microstructural forms with identical elemental composition:\n\n1.  **Crystalline Form:** A conventional slow-cooling process yields a polycrystalline solid composed of many small crystal grains.\n2.  **Amorphous Form:** A rapid solidification technique (melt-spinning) is used to cool the molten alloy so quickly that crystallization is suppressed, resulting in an amorphous metallic glass, which lacks any long-range periodic atomic structure.\n\nMagnetic \"hardness\" is quantitatively measured by coercivity, the magnetic field strength required to reduce the magnetization of a saturated material back to zero. A magnetically \"soft\" material has a very low coercivity, while a \"hard\" material (like a permanent magnet) has a high coercivity.\n\nWhich of the following statements most accurately predicts the change in magnetic properties and provides the correct underlying physical reason for transitioning from the crystalline form to the amorphous form of the alloy?\n\nA. The material will become magnetically harder, because the disordered atomic structure of the amorphous glass introduces a high density of random pinning sites that impede the motion of magnetic domain walls.\n\nB. The material will become magnetically softer, because the absence of both grain boundaries and magnetocrystalline anisotropy in the amorphous state removes major energy barriers to the motion of magnetic domain walls.\n\nC. The magnetic hardness will remain essentially unchanged, as coercivity is primarily determined by the alloy's elemental composition, which is identical in both forms.\n\nD. The material will become magnetically softer, because the higher electrical resistivity of the amorphous state suppresses the formation of magnetic domains, making the material easier to magnetize.\n\nE. The material will become magnetically harder, because the lack of a crystal lattice forces the atomic magnetic moments into a frustrated, high-energy configuration that resists changes in magnetization.", "solution": "We want to predict how the coercivity $H_{c}$ changes when the Fe-B-Si alloy goes from polycrystalline (crystalline) to amorphous (metallic glass), and identify the correct physical reason.\n\nCoercivity $H_{c}$ quantifies the magnetic field needed to bring the magnetization back to zero from saturation. In ferromagnets, $H_{c}$ is set by energy barriers to magnetization reversal, which can occur via coherent rotation or via motion of domain walls. The main contributions to these barriers are magnetocrystalline anisotropy and pinning of domain walls at microstructural defects.\n\nThe magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy density for a uniaxial ferromagnet can be written as\n$$\nE_{\\text{ani}} = K \\sin^{2}\\theta,\n$$\nwhere $K$ is the anisotropy constant and $\\theta$ is the angle between magnetization and the easy axis. A characteristic anisotropy field is\n$$\nH_{k} = \\frac{2K}{\\mu_{0} M_{s}},\n$$\nwith $M_{s}$ the saturation magnetization and $\\mu_{0}$ the vacuum permeability. In many cases, the intrinsic coercivity scales with $K$ (and the effectiveness of pinning), so reducing $K$ reduces $H_{c}$.\n\nFor domain walls, the exchange stiffness $A$ and anisotropy $K$ determine the wall width and energy:\n$$\n\\delta \\propto \\sqrt{\\frac{A}{K}}, \\quad \\gamma \\propto \\sqrt{A K}.\n$$\nThus, reducing $K$ increases the wall width $\\delta$ and decreases the wall energy $\\gamma$. A wider wall averages over local inhomogeneities more effectively, reducing pinning. Strong pinning centers in polycrystals include grain boundaries and dislocations; these impede domain wall motion and increase $H_{c}$.\n\nCompare the two microstructures:\n- Crystalline polycrystal: finite magnetocrystalline anisotropy $K$ and many grain boundaries act as pinning sites. Both effects raise the energy barriers to wall motion, increasing $H_{c}$.\n- Amorphous metallic glass: no long-range periodicity eliminates conventional magnetocrystalline anisotropy, so the average $K \\approx 0$; also, there are no grain boundaries, greatly reducing strong pinning centers. Consequently, domain walls move more freely and $H_{c}$ is lowered.\n\nTherefore, the material becomes magnetically softer in the amorphous state because both magnetocrystalline anisotropy and grain-boundary pinning are minimized.\n\nNow evaluate the options:\n- A: Claims amorphous disorder increases pinning and hardness. This is incorrect: absence of grain boundaries and the nearly vanishing $K$ in amorphous alloys reduce pinning and anisotropy-driven barriers, lowering $H_{c}$.\n- B: States the material becomes softer because the absence of grain boundaries and magnetocrystalline anisotropy removes major barriers to domain wall motion. This matches the analysis above.\n- C: Claims coercivity is determined only by composition. Incorrect: microstructure (anisotropy, defects) critically affects $H_{c}$.\n- D: Attributes softness to higher resistivity suppressing domain formation. Incorrect mechanism: resistivity reduces eddy-current losses at high frequency but does not suppress domain formation; domain formation minimizes magnetostatic energy and is not controlled by resistivity.\n- E: Invokes frustration from lack of lattice causing hardness. Incorrect for ferromagnetic metallic glasses used as soft magnetic materials; they are not spin glasses and do not become magnetically hard for this reason.\n\nHence, the correct choice is B.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{B}$$", "id": "1302556"}, {"introduction": "For permanent magnets, a high coercivity is essential, but we need a more precise way to quantify their ability to perform useful work.
