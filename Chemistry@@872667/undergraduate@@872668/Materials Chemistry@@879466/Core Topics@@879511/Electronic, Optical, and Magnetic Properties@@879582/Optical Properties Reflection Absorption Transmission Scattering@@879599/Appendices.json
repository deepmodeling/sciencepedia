This exercise is rooted in the fundamental principle of conservation of energy, applied to optics. By treating incident light as a whole that is split into reflected ($R$), transmitted ($T$), absorbed ($A$), and scattered ($S$) components, you will practice disentangling these phenomena to solve for an unknown quantity, a common task in materials characterization.

To characterize the material, a flat, polished sample is illuminated with a monochromatic beam of light at normal incidence. It is observed that a fraction $R$ of the incident light intensity is reflected from the sample, and a fraction $T$ is transmitted directly through it.\n\nThe portion of light that is neither reflected nor transmitted is internally attenuated within the ceramic composite. This attenuation is caused by two mechanisms: absorption, where the light's energy is converted to heat, and scattering, where the light is deflected in various directions. Let the fraction of the initial incident light intensity lost to absorption be denoted by $A$ and the fraction lost to scattering be denoted by $S$.\n\nThrough spectroscopic analysis, the team determines that for this specific material and wavelength, the energy lost to absorption is related to the energy lost to scattering by the equation $A = kS$, where $k$ is a given dimensionless constant.\n\nAssuming that reflection, transmission, absorption, and scattering account for all possible interactions of the light with the sample, derive a symbolic expression for the absorbance, $A$, in terms of the known fractions $R$, $T$, and the constant $k$.", "solution": "By conservation of energy for the incident light intensity, the fractions for reflection, transmission, absorption, and scattering must sum to unity:\n$$\nR + T + A + S = 1.\n$$\nRearranging gives the total internal loss as\n$$\nA + S = 1 - R - T.\n$$\nThe given relation between absorption and scattering is\n$$\nA = k S.\n$$\nSubstituting $A = k S$ into $A + S = 1 - R - T$ yields\n$$\nk S + S = (k + 1) S = 1 - R - T.\n$$\nSolving for $S$,\n$$\nS = \\frac{1 - R - T}{k + 1}.\n$$\nThen the absorbance is\n$$\nA = k S = \\frac{k\\left(1 - R - T\\right)}{k + 1}.\n$$\nThis expresses $A$ in terms of the known $R$, $T$, and the constant $k$.", "answer": "$$\\boxed{\\frac{k\\left(1 - R - T\\right)}{k + 1}}$$", "id": "1319904"}, {"introduction": "Having established that light can be lost within a material, we now focus on quantifying one of those loss mechanisms: absorption.
