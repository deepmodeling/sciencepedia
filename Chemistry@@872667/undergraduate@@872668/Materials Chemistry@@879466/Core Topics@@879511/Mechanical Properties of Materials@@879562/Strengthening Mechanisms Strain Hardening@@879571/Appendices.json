The tensile load is then completely removed.\n\nDue to the plastic deformation, the material develops an internal residual stress state. For the purpose of this analysis, we will use a simplified model where this process creates a uniform \"back stress\" within the material that opposes the direction of the initial plastic flow (i.e., it is a compressive stress). The magnitude of this back stress, $\\sigma_{back}$, is defined as the increase in flow stress due to strain hardening, which is the difference between the peak applied stress and the initial yield strength.\n\nImmediately after the tensile load is removed, the rod is subjected to a compressive load. Calculate the magnitude of the applied compressive stress at which the rod will begin to yield under these new conditions.
