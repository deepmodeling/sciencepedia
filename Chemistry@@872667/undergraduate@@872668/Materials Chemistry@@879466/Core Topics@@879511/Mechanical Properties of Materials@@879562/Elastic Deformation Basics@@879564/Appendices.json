By comparing two wires of different diameters under the same tensile force, you'll directly explore how geometry influences a material's response. This exercise reinforces the definitions of stress ($\\sigma$) and strain ($\\epsilon$) and illustrates why cross-sectional area is a critical design parameter for any component intended to bear a load [@problem_id:1296124].", "problem": "In a materials science laboratory, a researcher is comparing the elastic properties of two cylindrical wires, Wire A and Wire B, drawn from the same spool of a novel metallic alloy. Both wires have the same initial length, $L_0$. They are subjected to the same tensile force, $F$, which is small enough to ensure that any deformation is purely within the elastic limit. Wire A has a diameter $d$. Wire B is thicker, with a diameter of $2d$.\n\nAssuming the alloy is isotropic and homogeneous, determine the ratio of the elongation of Wire A to the elongation of Wire B, which can be written as $\\frac{\\Delta L_A}{\\Delta L_B}$.", "solution": "The tensile response within the elastic limit of a uniform, isotropic, homogeneous wire under an axial force is governed by Hooke's law. The engineering stress is $\\sigma = \\frac{F}{A}$, the strain is $\\epsilon = \\frac{\\Delta L}{L_{0}}$, and Hooke's law gives $\\sigma = E \\epsilon$, where $E$ is Young's modulus. Combining these relations yields\n$$\n\\Delta L = \\frac{\\sigma L_{0}}{E} = \\frac{F L_{0}}{A E}.\n$$\nFor two wires made of the same material and with the same initial length $L_{0}$ subjected to the same force $F$, the elongation is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area $A$.\n\nFor a circular cross-section of diameter $d$, the area is\n$$\nA_{A} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} d^{2}.\n$$\nFor Wire B with diameter $2d$, the area is\n$$\nA_{B} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} (2d)^{2} = 4 \\left( \\frac{\\pi}{4} d^{2} \\right) = 4 A_{A}.\n$$\nTherefore, the ratio of elongations is\n$$\n\\frac{\\Delta L_{A}}{\\Delta L_{B}} = \\frac{\\frac{F L_{0}}{A_{A} E}}{\\frac{F L_{0}}{A_{B} E}} = \\frac{A_{B}}{A_{A}} = 4.\n$$", "answer": "$$\\boxed{4}$$", "id": "1296124"}, {"introduction": "Moving beyond simple, uniform loading, this problem introduces a more realistic scenario where the stress within an object is not constant. By considering a fiber stretching under its own weight, you must use calculus to integrate the strain along its length.
