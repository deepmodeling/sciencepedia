This instability occurs at the point of maximum engineering stress, where the tensile load on the specimen reaches its peak.

Necking begins when the tensile load, $P$, on the specimen reaches its maximum value. At this maximum, the differential of the load is zero, i.e., $dP = 0$.\n\nThe load $P$ can be expressed as the product of the true stress $\\sigma_T$ and the instantaneous cross-sectional area $A$:\n$$P = \\sigma_T A$$\nTo find the maximum load, we differentiate this expression with respect to a variable that describes the deformation, such as the true strain $\\epsilon_T$, and set the result to zero. Using the product rule:\n$$\\frac{dP}{d\\epsilon_T} = A \\frac{d\\sigma_T}{d\\epsilon_T} + \\sigma_T \\frac{dA}{d\\epsilon_T} = 0$$\nThis can be rewritten in differential form as:\n$$A \\,d\\sigma_T + \\sigma_T \\,dA = 0$$\nRearranging this equation gives:\n$$-\\frac{dA}{A} = \\frac{d\\sigma_T}{\\sigma_T}$$\nThis equation gives a general condition for instability. We now need to relate the change in area to the change in strain.\n\nThe problem states that the volume of the specimen remains constant during plastic deformation. Let $L_0$ and $A_0$ be the initial length and area, and $L$ and $A$ be the instantaneous length and area. Volume conservation implies:\n$$A_0 L_0 = A L$$\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides gives:\n$$\\ln(A_0 L_0) = \\ln(A L) \\implies \\ln(A_0) + \\ln(L_0) = \\ln(A) + \\ln(L)$$\nDifferentiating this expression yields:\n$$0 = d(\\ln(A)) + d(\\ln(L)) = \\frac{dA}{A} + \\frac{dL}{L}$$\nTherefore:\n$$-\\frac{dA}{A} = \\frac{dL}{L}$$\nBy definition, the differential of true strain is $d\\epsilon_T = \\frac{dL}{L}$. Substituting this into the previous equation gives:\n$$-\\frac{dA}{A} = d\\epsilon_T$$\nNow we can substitute this result back into our condition for maximum load ($-\\frac{dA}{A} = \\frac{d\\sigma_T}{\\sigma_T}$):\n$$d\\epsilon_T = \\frac{d\\sigma_T}{\\sigma_T}$$\nThis can be rearranged to the well-known Considère's criterion for necking:\n$$\\frac{d\\sigma_T}{d\\epsilon_T} = \\sigma_T$$\nThis condition signifies that necking begins when the rate of strain hardening, $\\frac{d\\sigma_T}{d\\epsilon_T}$, is equal to the true stress, $\\sigma_T$. At this point, the strengthening effect of work hardening can no longer compensate for the weakening effect of the decreasing cross-sectional area.\n\nThe problem provides the Hollomon equation for the material's behavior: $\\sigma_T = K \\epsilon_T^n$. We can now use this to solve for the true strain at the onset of necking.\nFirst, we find the derivative of the true stress with respect to the true strain:\n$$\\frac{d\\sigma_T}{d\\epsilon_T} = \\frac{d}{d\\epsilon_T}(K \\epsilon_T^n) = K n \\epsilon_T^{n-1}$$\nNow, we substitute both $\\sigma_T$ and its derivative into Considère's criterion:\n$$K n \\epsilon_T^{n-1} = K \\epsilon_T^n$$\nWe can divide both sides by $K \\epsilon_T^{n-1}$ (assuming $\\epsilon_T \\neq 0$ and $K \\neq 0$), which simplifies the equation to:\n$$n = \\epsilon_T$$\nThis elegant result shows that for a material following the Hollomon law, necking begins when the true plastic strain becomes numerically equal to the strain-hardening exponent, $n$. Note that the strength coefficient $K$ is not needed for this part of the calculation.\n\nGiven $n = 0.35$, the true strain at the onset of necking, $\\epsilon_{T, \\text{neck}}$, is:\n$$\\epsilon_{T, \\text{neck}} = 0.35$$\nThe problem asks for the engineering strain, $e$, at this point.
